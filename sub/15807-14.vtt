¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:05.372 --> 00:08.039
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:08.109 --> 00:10.309
¶ That started
    from this tropic port ¶

00:10.377 --> 00:12.544
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.613 --> 00:15.079
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailing man ¶

00:15.148 --> 00:17.449
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:17.518 --> 00:19.785
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:19.853 --> 00:22.054

00:26.861 --> 00:29.194
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:29.263 --> 00:31.396
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:31.464 --> 00:34.199
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:34.268 --> 00:36.201
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:36.270 --> 00:38.303
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

01:40.000 --> 01:43.668
That's perfect, Gilligan.
     Water's flowing just right.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.737
Thanks, Professor.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.005
Hi, Skipper.

01:47.074 --> 01:49.307
Hi, Gilligan. Where do you want
these plants, Professor?

01:49.376 --> 01:52.477
Oh, here, Skipper,
              I'll take them.

01:52.545 --> 01:55.213
You know, Skipper,
  this gets awful monotonous.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.582
Gilligan, why don't you
make a game out of it?

01:57.651 --> 01:59.484
Pretend that you're taking
a long bicycle ride

01:59.553 --> 02:02.987
'from Cleveland, Ohio
     to Chicago, Illinois.'

02:03.056 --> 02:05.023
- Hey, Skipper?
        - What?

02:05.092 --> 02:07.992
Which way do I turn?
  Left or right at Cincinnati?

02:08.061 --> 02:10.562
Will you keep pedaling?
Left!

02:12.700 --> 02:14.866
You know, Skipper, these
breadfruit plants are fantastic.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.401
So rich
                   in food value

02:16.470 --> 02:18.237
a person could live indefinitely
just on breadfruit.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.138
I'd rather live
        on smorgasbord.

02:20.207 --> 02:21.539
Smorgasbord?

02:21.608 --> 02:24.343
Yeah, you know, smoked
     oysters, fried kippers

02:24.411 --> 02:28.647
pickled herring,
finnan haddie...salted peanuts.

02:30.050 --> 02:32.784
Boy...am I thirsty?

02:38.158 --> 02:39.891
- Gilligan.
          - Huh?

02:39.959 --> 02:42.494
The water won't flow
       when you're not pedaling.

02:42.562 --> 02:43.529
Oh!

02:52.539 --> 02:54.672
Pump, Gilligan, pump.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.175
I am pumping.

02:57.911 --> 03:00.044
Well, so you are.

03:00.113 --> 03:02.547
I don't understand it.
 The water's not coming through.

03:02.615 --> 03:04.716
- Maybe the spring dried up.
  - I think you're right.

03:04.784 --> 03:07.218
The spring is our only source
   of fresh water.

03:07.287 --> 03:08.686
- What happened to it?
     - I don't know.

03:08.755 --> 03:10.388
Well, if something
              has interfered

03:10.457 --> 03:12.857
with our water supply,
     this is just the beginning.

03:12.926 --> 03:16.394
First, the plants will die, and
 then the fruit-trees will die..

03:16.463 --> 03:19.897
...and then this can
           be serious, Gilligan.

03:19.966 --> 03:21.700
- Serious?
        - Very serious.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.908
Skipper, where are you?
    Hey, Skip..

03:31.445 --> 03:34.746
Don't use the water.
I got some important news for..

03:37.684 --> 03:39.150
Skipper?

03:39.219 --> 03:42.220
[chuckles]
  Really, Gilligan.
  Do I look like the Skipper?

03:42.289 --> 03:45.624
Well...Uh, uh!

03:46.926 --> 03:49.961
I don't know. You know,
    bare feet are bare feet.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.931
- Even..
            - Yes?

03:52.999 --> 03:55.399
No, you sure don't
     look like the Skipper.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.468
Thanks. Hey, would
       you be a darling

03:57.537 --> 03:59.270
and get me that towel
     over there?

03:59.339 --> 04:00.872
Oh!

04:03.544 --> 04:04.943
You mean
       this little towel?

04:05.012 --> 04:07.679
Yeah. Come on, bring it over.
 I won't bite you.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.680
You promise
       you won't bite me?

04:09.749 --> 04:12.951
I promise
               I won't bite you.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.086
Ow! You bit me!

04:15.155 --> 04:16.887
Yeah, aren't I a tease?

04:19.024 --> 04:21.425
(Ginger)
      'Hey, don't go away,
      I'll be right out.'

04:21.494 --> 04:24.128
You'll be right out?

04:24.197 --> 04:26.231
'Ready or not,
                  here I come.'

04:26.300 --> 04:27.832
'I'm not ready.'

04:27.901 --> 04:30.935
Well, I was just washing
        my hair, silly.

04:31.004 --> 04:34.139
- You certainly are a bachelor.
- Only with girls.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.607
Don't be too shy.

04:35.676 --> 04:39.644
You know, I think
              under all that mud

04:39.713 --> 04:44.016
there's a charming,
             attractive man.

04:54.394 --> 04:56.761
Ginger's scarf.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.298
Lovely a girl
       as I've ever seen.

05:06.105 --> 05:09.474
Here's for one of the loveliest
persons on the island.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.644
Thanks, Skipper.
       My first corsage.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.812
- Does that mean we're engaged?
- Gilligan!

05:14.881 --> 05:17.182
What are you doing in there
  with your clothes on?

05:17.250 --> 05:19.884
I've been trying to find you.
I've some very important news.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.152
News? What news?

05:21.221 --> 05:24.188
Ah, oh, I don't know,
   with everything happening.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.558
The mud and Ginger.

05:26.627 --> 05:29.161
My first corsage.

05:29.229 --> 05:31.930
Here, Gilligan,
this will wake you up.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.566
- Hey, there's no water.
    - Right!

05:35.635 --> 05:37.935
That's what the news is about.
 We're out of water.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.705
Until we locate a spring
        or dig a new well

05:40.774 --> 05:42.407
I suggest we start
             a rationing system.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.042
A very good suggestion,
    Professor.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.277
Thank you, ladies, for your
 contribution to water supply.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.612
- Welcome.
           - Welcome.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.847
Well, that's all
the fresh water I had.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.916
Oh, my goodness,
               this isn't water.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.086
It's my perfume, Mad Desire,
    mixed with Flaming Passion.

05:55.155 --> 05:58.023
Great. I wonder what the men
will do when they drink that.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.692
I don't know,
      but I'm dying to find out.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.695
No fish, girls.
          It'll make us thirsty.

06:03.764 --> 06:04.696
Okay.

06:05.565 --> 06:08.700
Water, water, water.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.835
I got to have water.
      I'll go mad.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.338
Water, water.

06:13.407 --> 06:16.440
Water, please give me water.

06:16.509 --> 06:18.443
Gilligan, cut that.
             Cut that out!

06:18.512 --> 06:20.445
We haven't even
          started rationing yet.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.948
I know, I was just
practicing for later.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.083
Here, start by emptying
         these containers

06:25.151 --> 06:26.150
into our water supply.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.986
Aye-aye, sir.

06:33.793 --> 06:36.694
Professor, is it true that
you're planning to ration water?

06:36.763 --> 06:38.029
That's right,
Mr. Howell.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.331
We only have enough water
for a few days.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.634
We may tap a spring
      in a few days.

06:42.702 --> 06:43.969
I saw some shale
                rock formations

06:44.037 --> 06:45.970
where we could
                 all dig a well.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.641
Well, count me out. When I think
of well, I usually strike oil.

06:49.710 --> 06:53.578
Yeah, some people have a green
thumb, Thurston has an oily one.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.179
Skipper, what happens
     when we get thirsty?

06:55.248 --> 06:58.249
I mean, right now, I'd like
  to have a cool glass--

06:58.317 --> 07:01.853
Gilligan, please. Now, until we
find a new spring or locate

07:01.921 --> 07:04.923
another place to dig a well,
let's not use the word "water."

07:04.991 --> 07:06.925
It only makes everybody
more thirsty.

07:06.993 --> 07:08.726
I'm sorry, Skipper,
      but I won't mention

07:08.795 --> 07:10.528
the name of that
       wet liquid again.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.531
See, I didn't say water.

07:14.801 --> 07:17.301
Now, I suggest we start
  rationing the amount we drink.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.837
Exactly, Professor.
Now, like I said

07:18.905 --> 07:21.439
we only have a few days left
in our mm-mm supply.

07:21.508 --> 07:22.874
"Mm-mm" supply?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.109
Shhh..

07:26.913 --> 07:29.914
So, Mr. Howell, I'm gonna put
you in charge of the rationing.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.083
As usual, Thurston,
          the drinks are on you.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.185
- See you at the hut, dear.
  - Ta-ta, dear.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.688
Well, let's get started
looking for our new spring.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.723
I have my trusted,
new divining rod here.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.525
If there's anything to drink
in the island, I'll find it.

07:41.594 --> 07:43.628
This rod will point out
even a few drops.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.229
A divining rod?

07:45.298 --> 07:47.532
We can't afford to trust
   our lives to superstition.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.100
Oh, Professor, it's
not superstition.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.669
Mr. Howell, what do you think
 of my divining rod?

07:51.738 --> 07:53.771
Well, I think it's divine.
      No, it's utter nonsense.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.473
Hogwash, I don't believe it.

07:55.542 --> 07:58.109
Hey, look!

07:58.177 --> 08:00.845
It's pointing towards
     Mr. Howell's leg.

08:00.913 --> 08:03.414
Well, I'd better go to the hut.
Lovey's expecting me.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.883
Coming, dear,
        be right there.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.686
Come on, Mr. Howell,
      your pant's leg.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.803
Skipper, I'm still thirsty.
  But, I didn't say W-A-T--

08:25.872 --> 08:28.206
Alright, little buddy, alright.

08:29.576 --> 08:32.277
Come here, Gilligan.
      I got an idea.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.544
This is a little trick
          of survival I learnt

08:34.614 --> 08:36.114
from the natives
               in the Solomon's.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.583
Now put these pebbles in your
mouth and suck on 'em. It works.

08:39.653 --> 08:42.787
[both mumbling]

08:45.325 --> 08:49.094
Oh, please don't talk to me when
I got a mouth full of pebbles.

08:49.162 --> 08:52.097
[mumbling]

08:52.165 --> 08:54.099
[coughing]

08:55.635 --> 08:57.435
What was it that was
            so important

08:57.504 --> 08:59.237
that you had
                   to say to me?

08:59.305 --> 09:01.139
I was gonna tell not to talk
with pebbles in your mouth

09:01.208 --> 09:03.774
- 'cause you might..
      - Swallow them.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.377
Thanks a lot, Gilligan.

09:05.445 --> 09:06.911
Skipper, it's starting
to point.

09:06.979 --> 09:08.880
- Yeah, right over there.
   - No, Skipper, over here.

09:08.948 --> 09:10.881
- Over there!
   - No, Skipper, over here.

09:10.950 --> 09:12.217
- Over there!
         - Here.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.252
- There!
            - Here.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.689
Oh, Captain! Oh, Gilligan!
   Your water boy.

09:22.429 --> 09:25.230
Good heavens, it's so dry,
   it's raining dirt.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.332
Water, water, Captain.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.268
Skipper!

09:33.606 --> 09:34.872
Let me do it.

09:34.941 --> 09:37.308
Oh, I see.
     I'm just in time here.

09:37.377 --> 09:40.511
Mr. Howell, you're covered
with dirt. Let me brush you off.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.513
- Here.
- What? Don't do that, Gilligan.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.515
Your hands
are dirty. Look!

09:44.584 --> 09:45.983
Not now,
                     Mr. Howell.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.052
Ready for our afternoon
    rations already?

09:48.121 --> 09:51.355
That's exactly why I'm here.
I'm your friendly water boy.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.958
Alright, Gilligan. Go ahead,
now, now that's a good boy.

09:54.026 --> 09:55.660
Close your eyes,
open your mouth.

09:55.729 --> 09:56.995
Okay, fill her up.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.029
- Here we are.
   - Eyes closed, mouth open.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.600
- Here we go.
         - Here we go.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.404
Is that all I get?
              Eight drops?

10:06.472 --> 10:07.806
<i> Eight</i> drops?

10:07.874 --> 10:10.508
Good heavens, you got
your evening rations too.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.310
Here's one
for the road.

10:18.017 --> 10:21.719
Gilligan, I want you to guard
   this water with your life.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.022
- You can count on me, Skipper.
- I hope so.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.324
'Cause if you don't guard
       this with your life

10:26.393 --> 10:28.360
your life might not
             be worth guarding.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.362
- Got a knife?
         - A knife?

10:30.430 --> 10:32.396
Skipper, those people
out there are my friends.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.400
Oh, I just want to mark
  the water level on this stick.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.235
Alright now.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.238
That's how much
              water we have now.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.374
We better have this much
        when I get back.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.176
Those folks might start
         getting desperate.

10:45.244 --> 10:47.779
- Desperate?
       - Very desperate.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.649
Gilligan, keep
       a stiff upper lip.

10:51.717 --> 10:54.085
[howling]

10:57.824 --> 10:59.391
I'm not afraid.

10:59.459 --> 11:02.560
I'm not scared. I'm not
afraid, I'm not afraid.

11:02.629 --> 11:05.196
I did it. I'm not
one bit afraid.

11:05.264 --> 11:06.364
[screams]

11:06.433 --> 11:08.866
Sorry, my boy. I didn't
         mean to alarm you.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.901
You didn't alarm me,
you just scared me.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.703
There's something
             I have to tell you.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.539
If it's about the water,
the answer's no.

11:14.608 --> 11:17.107
No, I've something I must
 tell you in deepest confidence.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.277
You know, come over,
            come over here.

11:21.748 --> 11:24.182
Come here, Gilligan.
      Gilligan, come here!

11:24.251 --> 11:26.317
Okay, Mr. Howell.
But when I come over here

11:26.386 --> 11:28.819
it's the same as the answer
over there, no!

11:28.888 --> 11:30.821
Gilligan, my boy,
               I must tell you

11:30.890 --> 11:32.723
that you are in very
            serious trouble.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.325
Well, I happened
          to know that someone's

11:34.394 --> 11:36.094
planning to steal
               the water supply.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.495
[whistling]

11:37.564 --> 11:38.929
- Who?
            - 'Who?'

11:38.998 --> 11:41.232
'It's someone that you
     know very, very well.'

11:41.301 --> 11:42.233
[whistling]

11:42.302 --> 11:44.435
'Why are you whistling,
    Mr. Howell?'

11:44.504 --> 11:45.870
[chuckles]
                      Bird call.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.171
¶ Ta-di-di ¶

11:47.240 --> 11:49.740
[whistling]

11:49.809 --> 11:51.742
Now the master
                  plan, you see

11:51.811 --> 11:53.277
is these two people
             distract you

11:53.346 --> 11:54.611
and while your back
             is turned..

11:54.680 --> 11:55.880
Huh?

11:55.949 --> 11:56.880
...one of them will
             steal the water.

11:56.949 --> 11:57.915
Who'd do
a thing like that?

11:57.984 --> 12:01.319
Please!
                  Shh! No names.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.421
- How many are there?
     - Now, there's two.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.456
Ha-hard to tell,
      you see, in a crowd.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.758
Mrs. Howell and I both knew
  if this should happen

12:07.827 --> 12:09.693
that your name
                  would be mud.

12:09.762 --> 12:11.528
Oh, changing my name
wouldn't do any good.

12:11.597 --> 12:15.099
The Skipper could still find me.
He knows what I look like.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.700
- Good luck, my boy.
    - Goodnight, Mr. Howell.

12:16.769 --> 12:19.971
And thanks for the warning. You
sure you can't tell their names?

12:20.039 --> 12:21.138
I would never
                 forgive myself.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.842
I better turn in.
               Goodnight.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.979
[whistling]

12:31.918 --> 12:35.586
'Ooh! My goodness, me now!'

12:35.655 --> 12:38.523
'Why has Gilligan left
   the water bag unguarded?'

12:38.591 --> 12:42.026
'Anybody who wanted to steal
it could have stolen it by now.'

12:42.095 --> 12:44.995
Now, where in the world
         could Gilligan be?

12:45.064 --> 12:46.464
- Here I am.
          - Oh!

12:46.533 --> 12:48.065
My goodness, Gilligan,
          where were you?

12:48.134 --> 12:49.801
I was hiding
behind the bush.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.370
Lucky for you, you didn't
try to steal any water.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.372
Oh, Gilligan. You silly,
        suspicious boy.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.241
Why in the world would
         I do a thing like that?

12:57.310 --> 13:00.177
Skipper told me that you were
   on guard duty

13:00.246 --> 13:02.580
so I came over
            to keep you company.

13:02.649 --> 13:03.948
Gee, thanks.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.250
Gee, Gilligan.
     I don't know how you do it.

13:06.319 --> 13:09.987
I mean, hour after hour
         after hour.

13:10.056 --> 13:12.656
(Ginger)
      Don't you ever get sleepy?

13:12.725 --> 13:16.293
I mean, don't you ever find that
your eyes are getting heavier

13:16.362 --> 13:19.363
and heavier
           and wanting to close?

13:19.432 --> 13:23.400
Arms so heavy, heavy,
          you can't keep 'em up.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.336
Don't you ever feel
             that you're going

13:25.404 --> 13:27.972
into a deep, deep,
              deep sleep?

13:28.041 --> 13:29.273
- Nope.
            - Ah!

13:29.342 --> 13:31.275
Of course not.
               A big, strong man

13:31.344 --> 13:33.377
like you would
              never fall asleep.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.479
'I mean a big,
     strong man like you.'

13:35.548 --> 13:38.950
'Your right eye could never
  get so heavy.'

13:39.018 --> 13:41.152
'There, hold it open.'

13:41.221 --> 13:46.056
Big, strong man like you could
never, never, never fall asleep.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.259
No, I could never fall..

13:48.327 --> 13:51.562
[snoring]

13:51.631 --> 13:54.499
'Sleep. Asleep!'

13:56.936 --> 13:59.504
Goodbye, Gilligan.

14:05.978 --> 14:07.144
Gilligan!

14:07.213 --> 14:10.548
Advance and be recognized,
   Skipper.

14:10.617 --> 14:13.017
- Right this way.
- What's all the big fuss about?

14:13.086 --> 14:15.420
I'll show you. Ladies.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.393
Mrs. Howell.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.839
Gilligan, you're lucky.
It's all there.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.076
Now, aren't you all
ashamed of yourselves?

14:40.146 --> 14:42.347
I'm ashamed
we got caught.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.416
- And you, Gilligan--
    - Skipper, I-I-I don't--

14:45.485 --> 14:47.518
Gilligan, what have you
been doing all this time?

14:47.587 --> 14:49.319
I made a new
             divining rod. Look.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.121
Oh, it takes
a very special technique

14:51.190 --> 14:52.590
to make a divining rod.

14:52.659 --> 14:55.392
Will you stop being sore at me
 if it hits water?

14:55.461 --> 14:58.262
I promise I will never ever
  get sore at you again

14:58.330 --> 15:00.097
if that divining
        rod hits water.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.333
- 'Well, let me see it.'
    - No.

15:10.276 --> 15:12.310
The boy
needs therapy.

15:29.361 --> 15:32.363
Darn clever, Professor.
  Sure beats digging by hand.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.865
But we've gotta keep
      our fingers crossed.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.002
Gilligan spilled every drop
  of water we had left.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.305
Hi, Skipper.
         Hi, Professor.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.772
I don't blame you
     for not talking to me

15:41.841 --> 15:44.008
but I wanna help.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.577
Well, if you want me
     to go away, just nod.

15:48.247 --> 15:51.115
I'll give you one more chance.
 If you want me to go..

15:51.184 --> 15:52.984
...away. Fine.

15:55.054 --> 15:57.321
- Gee, I'm thirsty.
      - Oh, I told you.

15:57.389 --> 15:59.523
Concentrate on your sewing.
It'll take your mind off of it.

15:59.592 --> 16:02.292
That's what I did. Well,
  sewing reminded me of dresses.

16:02.361 --> 16:05.163
And dresses reminded me of wool.
Wool reminded me of sheep

16:05.231 --> 16:07.164
and sheep reminded me
           of the mountains.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.966
The mountains reminded
          me of the desert

16:09.035 --> 16:10.567
and the desert made me
          thirsty again.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.803
Hi, girls. Came by
       to cheer you up.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.638
I doubt if you can
cheer us up.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.141
We're making a sheet
to catch the morning dew.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.510
If we're lucky, we'll get
       a thimbleful of water.

16:19.578 --> 16:21.979
Look on the bright side,
  we might find a spring soon.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.247
If we don't,
         it might rain.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.483
If it doesn't rain,
    people sometimes last--

16:25.551 --> 16:27.485
Gee, Gilligan, do you really
    want to cheer us up?

16:27.554 --> 16:31.989
- Yeah, what can I do?
   - Go cheer up the Howells.

16:32.058 --> 16:33.591
I can't understand it,
     Thurston.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.427
All that nonsense about
 a divining rod to bring water.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.029
'Uh, yes, I know.
Totally unscientific.'

16:39.098 --> 16:41.265
- Mm, are you ready?
      - Yes, yes. Ha ha.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.235
Anytime you are, my dear.
One, two, three.

16:44.304 --> 16:48.238
¶ Ha-hunga-hunga-hunga-ha ¶

16:48.307 --> 16:51.175
¶ Hunga-hunga-hunga-ha ¶

16:51.244 --> 16:53.711
¶ Hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga ¶

16:53.780 --> 16:56.080
- Ah! Rain!
          - Rain!

16:57.850 --> 17:00.184
You're not listening.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.519
I don't understand it,
          Thurston.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.721
It worked last year
             in Yellowstone Park

17:03.790 --> 17:05.021
for the Cherokees.

17:05.090 --> 17:06.857
What's wrong, anyway?

17:06.925 --> 17:09.193
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Howell.

17:09.262 --> 17:12.628
Now I know
what's wrong.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.266
Dear folks, every time
  I try to do something right

17:15.334 --> 17:17.267
everything goes wrong.

17:17.336 --> 17:20.369
Maybe everybody will be
    better off without me.

17:20.439 --> 17:27.211
I make nothing
         but mistakes.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.414
Even make a mistake
      writing mistakes.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.581
[croaking]

17:30.650 --> 17:32.549
Hey! Hi, frog.

17:32.618 --> 17:35.152
Could you mind getting your
  wet feet off my desk here?

17:35.221 --> 17:36.487
Come on. Let's go.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.889
[croaking]

17:38.958 --> 17:42.093
Wet feet? Frog?

17:42.161 --> 17:44.094
Put 'em all together,
     they spell water.

17:44.163 --> 17:46.297
Okay, come on, partner.
    Take me to your water.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.864
Come on, let's go.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.066
Woo-hoo!

17:49.134 --> 17:50.468
I'll follow you. Yeah!

17:53.573 --> 17:55.506
Let's go, come on.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.940
[croaking]

17:57.009 --> 17:59.609
Let's go now,
         come on.

17:59.678 --> 18:03.047
Froggy, where are you?
     Hey, froggy?

18:03.116 --> 18:07.685
Listen,
  I don't wanna squish...you!

18:07.753 --> 18:08.719
[croaking]

18:10.289 --> 18:12.123
There you are.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.127
Skipper. Oh, Skipper,
    have you seen Gilligan?

18:17.196 --> 18:19.130
Oh, Mary Ann,
            if I'd seen Gilligan

18:19.199 --> 18:21.132
would I be riding
               this contraption?

18:21.201 --> 18:23.167
I think he may have done
something desperate.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.903
Look at the note
I found.

18:25.971 --> 18:30.708
"And maybe everyone would
   be better off without me."

18:30.777 --> 18:33.210
Oh, this is all my fault.
       My poor, little buddy.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.611
Skipper, you don't think..

18:34.680 --> 18:36.881
I don't know. We better
         find out right away.

18:51.997 --> 18:53.331
Froggy!

18:55.968 --> 18:57.435
[croaking]

19:05.744 --> 19:08.179
[croaking]

19:19.391 --> 19:22.226
Alright, frog, I give up.

19:27.466 --> 19:31.835
There! There you are.
     Come here. Come here.

19:31.904 --> 19:32.904
Hey, you alright?

19:33.773 --> 19:34.839
[croaks]
            Okay?

19:34.908 --> 19:37.407
[croaks]
          You alright?

19:37.476 --> 19:40.611
[croaks]
   Take me to the water now.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.382
For you, it's easy.
     Come on, come on. Oh!

19:45.618 --> 19:47.852
Froggy! Frog!
        Where did he go?

19:47.920 --> 19:49.987
Hey, frog!

19:50.056 --> 19:53.524
Oh! What a big hole. I think
  I find out where he went.

19:53.593 --> 19:57.862
I just have to hang on
    and wait for help. Help!

20:07.973 --> 20:11.541
Oh, it's an underground cave.
   There's lots of water.

20:11.610 --> 20:12.943
[croaks]

20:13.012 --> 20:15.779
Oh, hi. Thanks for helping me.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.649
I knew you would. Look,
 there's fresh water all over.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.985
When I tell the others,
    they'll be excited.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.554
But how?

20:23.622 --> 20:27.424
I can't reach the top,
 and the sides are all smooth.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.594
What am I gonna do?

20:29.662 --> 20:31.896
[croaking]

20:31.964 --> 20:35.065
Thanks for your advice, but it's
too bad I don't speak frog.

20:35.133 --> 20:38.034
First, we've gotta search every
square foot of this island.

20:38.103 --> 20:40.804
We'll never forgive ourselves
 if we don't find that boy.

20:40.873 --> 20:43.674
Oh, if we ever do find him,
  well, we'll hug him and..

20:43.743 --> 20:45.710
and squeeze him and,
      and kiss him and--

20:45.778 --> 20:47.744
Hey, what are we waiting for?
 Let's go.

20:47.813 --> 20:50.014
If I yell,
     somebody will hear me.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.082
Hello-o-o..

20:52.151 --> 20:54.552
[echoes]

20:56.288 --> 20:57.287
[croaking]

20:57.356 --> 20:58.622
I wasn't talking to you.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.658
- Gilligan, my boy.
      - Gilligan!

21:00.726 --> 21:02.660
- Gilligan!
          - Gilligan!

21:02.729 --> 21:05.096
- Oh, Gilligan!
        - Gilligan!

21:05.164 --> 21:07.264
- Gilligan!
          - Gilligan!

21:07.333 --> 21:09.900
Gilligan, little buddy.
    Gilligan!

21:12.372 --> 21:16.006
My little buddy's hat. Gilligan!

21:16.075 --> 21:21.412
Couldn't...be in the hole.
   No, he wouldn't have.

21:21.480 --> 21:25.416
Gilligan? Gilligan,
      are you down there?

21:25.485 --> 21:27.317
- Hey, Skipper.
        - Gilligan!

21:27.386 --> 21:30.921
[screaming]
         Gilliga-a-an..

21:32.791 --> 21:33.891
Welcome.

21:35.028 --> 21:36.960
Gilligan, little buddy.
         Is that you?

21:37.029 --> 21:38.996
Yes, Skipper. What are
you doing down here?

21:39.065 --> 21:41.865
- I brought you your hat.
   - Oh, thanks, Skipper.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.368
I'm glad to see you,
even if I can't.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.702
Well, think how happy I am.

21:45.771 --> 21:47.905
Yeah, look.
Fresh water, Skipper.

21:47.974 --> 21:51.041
I don't mean about the water,
little buddy. I mean about you.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.910
I don't mind telling you
   I've got a lump in my throat.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.980
Well, be careful. Don't swallow.
It might be my frog.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.982
- Gilligan! Gilligan!
     - Gilligan!

21:59.051 --> 22:01.585
Oh, Thurston, we simply have got
to find that boy.

22:01.653 --> 22:05.021
I know what I'll do. Offer
    a reward. $5,000 or $10,000.

22:05.090 --> 22:08.491
Thurston, there are times when
money is absolutely useless.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.527
Ooh! What you said, Lovey.

22:10.596 --> 22:13.097
I see a tunnel there.
Maybe we can get out.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.599
We can't see where we're going.
 We need light.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.067
I got some matches, Skipper.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.969
Oh, Gilligan, so have I

22:19.037 --> 22:21.906
but we fell in the water.
   The matches are wet.

22:21.974 --> 22:24.574
Why don't we build
a fire? Dry 'em out?

22:24.643 --> 22:26.944
You can't light a fire
    and dry out the matches

22:27.013 --> 22:29.479
when you need dry matches
   to light a fire.

22:29.548 --> 22:32.882
No wonder you are the Skipper
and I'm only the crew.

22:32.951 --> 22:35.586
- Gilligan! Gilligan!
     - Gilligan!

22:35.655 --> 22:37.288
Let's search that area
over there.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.623
I once had a part in a jungle
 movie where everybody got lost.

22:40.692 --> 22:41.725
- Everybody?
          - Yes.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.060
And nobody ever found them.

22:43.129 --> 22:46.763
The hero died, the heroine died.
They all died.

22:46.832 --> 22:48.765
But that picture had
            a happy ending.

22:48.834 --> 22:50.634
How could it have
a happy ending?

22:50.703 --> 22:52.136
Made three million dollars.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.705
- Let's go.
          - Gilligan!

22:54.773 --> 22:56.640
- Gilligan, my boy? Gilligan!
 - Gilligan! Oh!

22:56.708 --> 22:59.243
(Mr. Howell)
    'I wonder where that boy
    has gone to.'

22:59.312 --> 23:01.378
Hello-o-o..

23:01.447 --> 23:03.480
Thurston, that was
              Gilligan's voice.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.482
Can anyone hear us?

23:05.551 --> 23:07.918
And that's the Skipper's voice.

23:07.987 --> 23:10.287
Thurston, I think they're
       down that hole.

23:10.356 --> 23:11.988
Heavens to Sherlock Holmes,
we found them.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.358
Gilligan, Skipper,
we're here, we're here.

23:14.426 --> 23:16.594
That's wonderfu-u-ul..

23:16.662 --> 23:19.663
It's dark down here.
Can you give us some light?

23:19.732 --> 23:21.498
Oh, it's dark. Yes,
I can imagine.

23:21.567 --> 23:25.201
H-here, here's some matches.

23:25.270 --> 23:28.472
Nice catch, little buddy.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.774
Careful now.

23:30.843 --> 23:32.676
No, no, hit it on the..

23:32.745 --> 23:36.046
...the other side. The side
     of the box, eh.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.515
Oh, Gilligan.
           I know you can do it.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.551
On the side
         of the box, little boy.

23:40.619 --> 23:42.118
Mr. Howell,
have you found them?

23:42.187 --> 23:44.154
They're down there.
 Just threw them some matches.

23:44.223 --> 23:45.656
- Matches?
           - Yes.

23:45.725 --> 23:48.058
Why, there may be explosive
gasses down there. Gilligan!

23:48.127 --> 23:50.260
- Don't light that!
      - Gilligan.

23:50.329 --> 23:52.563
Get back, everybody. Get back.

24:03.242 --> 24:05.942
- Skipper?
          - Gilligan?

24:06.011 --> 24:08.078
How are we gonna get 'em up
from there?

24:08.147 --> 24:11.849
Never mind that. How're you
gonna get us down from here?

24:20.392 --> 24:24.160
[indistinct chatter]

24:24.229 --> 24:25.395
Hold it down now, folks.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.663
I think we should have
     a few words

24:26.732 --> 24:30.266
from the man of the hour,
   Gilligan.

24:30.335 --> 24:31.969
[whistling and clapping]

24:32.037 --> 24:33.837
Thank you.
     It just goes to show

24:33.906 --> 24:36.006
what I can do
      when I concentrate.

24:36.074 --> 24:38.575
And you did this one
   all by yourself, Gilligan.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.144
Yes, sir. And I know
    how to locate water now

24:41.213 --> 24:42.479
without help from anyone.

24:42.548 --> 24:44.081
Uh!

24:44.150 --> 24:47.218
Well, you gotta give credit
  where credit is due.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.687
- Ole.
             - Ole.

24:50.756 --> 24:52.522
Here's to Froggy.

24:52.591 --> 24:54.725
[croaks]

25:04.937 --> 25:06.136
¶ Now this is the tale
     of the castaways ¶

25:06.205 --> 25:08.004
¶ They're here
    for a long, long time ¶

25:08.073 --> 25:10.406
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

25:10.475 --> 25:12.175
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:12.244 --> 25:14.711
¶ The first mate
     and his skipper too ¶

25:14.780 --> 25:16.646
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:16.715 --> 25:18.915
¶ To make
    the others comfortable ¶

25:18.984 --> 25:21.051
¶ In the tropic island nest ¶

25:21.120 --> 25:23.486
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motor cars ¶

25:23.555 --> 25:25.588
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:25.657 --> 25:27.824
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:27.893 --> 25:29.860
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

25:29.928 --> 25:32.329
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:32.398 --> 25:34.364
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:34.433 --> 25:36.667
¶ For seven stranded castaways ¶

25:36.736 --> 25:38.802
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶
