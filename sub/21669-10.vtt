WEBVTT

00:00.467 --> 00:02.670
<i>Previously on Hell's Kitchen.</i>

00:02.671 --> 00:04.272
We murdered these dudes.

00:04.273 --> 00:06.407
After another
dinner service victory,

00:06.408 --> 00:08.476
the red team was flying high.

00:08.477 --> 00:10.078
It felt real
good to me.

00:10.079 --> 00:11.446
While the men hit a new low.

00:11.447 --> 00:12.547
We cannot lose anymore.

00:12.548 --> 00:13.881
This is a disgrace.

00:13.882 --> 00:15.850
At the "High-Stakes" challenge...

00:15.851 --> 00:16.951
<i>We are gonna
test your creativity.</i>

00:16.952 --> 00:18.720
The red team...

00:18.721 --> 00:21.656
Chose to present
Robyn's dish over Kimmie's.

00:21.657 --> 00:22.657
I was so mad because
I worked my ass off

00:22.658 --> 00:23.891
on this thing.

00:23.892 --> 00:26.060
A decision...
Robyn.

00:26.061 --> 00:28.029
It's soggy,
and it's overcooked.

00:28.030 --> 00:29.163
That proved to be costly.

00:29.164 --> 00:30.598
Men win.

00:30.599 --> 00:32.500
But chef Ramsey was curious.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.001
Kimmie, I want
to taste your dish.

00:34.002 --> 00:35.837
<i>It is delicious.</i>

00:35.838 --> 00:38.555
I feel so much
redemption right now,

00:38.556 --> 00:40.608
you have no idea.
Bad choice, ladies.

00:40.609 --> 00:43.344
<i>That would have given Clemenza
a run for his money.</i>

00:43.345 --> 00:45.346
I'm not gonna talk
to anybody unless I need to.

00:45.347 --> 00:46.514
That's kinda bitchy.

00:46.515 --> 00:49.684
<i>Kimmie was having none
of Robyn's bad attitude.</i>

00:49.685 --> 00:51.686
I totally outshined that bitch,
and she's totally jealous.

00:51.687 --> 00:53.521
<i>As Hell's Kitchen got ready</i>

00:53.522 --> 00:54.856
to open for
family steak night...

00:54.857 --> 00:56.457
I'm continuing to get
the kicked out of me

00:56.458 --> 00:57.692
every single day.

00:57.693 --> 00:59.794
Patrick sought
strength from his family.

00:59.795 --> 01:01.863
Daddy wants to win this.

01:01.864 --> 01:03.731
And in the red kitchen...

01:03.732 --> 01:04.965
Tiffany's onions,
they were too thick.

01:04.967 --> 01:06.901
Barbie was fed up with Tiffany.

01:06.902 --> 01:09.237
Tiffany doesn't
care about her standards.

01:09.238 --> 01:11.539
And Tiffany
was fed up with Barbie.

01:11.540 --> 01:13.407
Barbie knows everything.

01:13.408 --> 01:15.143
She knows how
to cook everything.

01:15.144 --> 01:16.477
She needs to mind
her own business.

01:16.478 --> 01:18.513
I could just break something
over her head right now.

01:18.514 --> 01:21.682
Then just as dinner
service was ready to begin...

01:21.683 --> 01:23.017
Oh, my God!

01:23.018 --> 01:24.619
<i>What just happened?</i>

01:24.620 --> 01:25.787
I just burnt my hand.

01:25.788 --> 01:27.588
Disaster struck the red team

01:27.589 --> 01:29.223
as Kimmie was
scalded with pan grease

01:29.224 --> 01:31.526
all the way up her arm.
Mmm.

01:31.527 --> 01:32.647
I just have to
get back in there.

01:32.648 --> 01:33.923
You're not allowed
to get back in the kitchen.

01:33.924 --> 01:35.974
Like, asap.
You're not going back in there.

01:35.975 --> 01:39.111
Tonight find out if
Kimmie's severe burn keeps her

01:39.112 --> 01:41.602
from dinner service.
Aaah!

01:41.603 --> 01:44.305
<i>In one of the most
explosive Hell's Kitchen's ever.</i>

01:44.306 --> 01:46.007
watch who
you're calling bitch!

01:46.008 --> 01:48.276
What are you gonna do?
Maybe cry some more! Crybaby!

01:48.277 --> 01:50.678
As the fight
to become head chef

01:50.679 --> 01:52.490
at Gordon Ramsay's Steak
at the Paris, Las Vegas,

01:52.491 --> 01:54.682
gets ugly.

01:54.683 --> 01:57.451
I ain't gonna hit you because
I ain't a child like you.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.514
Oh, my God!

03:00.515 --> 03:03.183
<i>Medic!
I just burnt my hand.</i>

03:03.184 --> 03:04.985
And the
women have suffered

03:04.986 --> 03:05.919
a big casualty.

03:05.920 --> 03:06.687
<i>What happened?</i>

What happened?</i>

03:09.724 --> 03:10.691
<i>Oh, my God... Clemenza!</i>

03:10.692 --> 03:11.625
Take her to the medic.

03:11.626 --> 03:12.860
Yes, chef... come on, come on.

03:12.861 --> 03:14.628
Come on, shh, shh.

03:14.629 --> 03:15.796
Come on.

03:15.797 --> 03:17.698
Is she gonna
be all right?

03:17.699 --> 03:19.900
<i>Come on, don't give up.</i>

03:19.901 --> 03:22.202
And I hate that this
is happening to her right now.

03:22.203 --> 03:26.240
And we need her in the kitchen
so I'm hoping that she's okay.

03:26.241 --> 03:28.542
<i>So this just now
happened right here, right now?</i>

03:28.543 --> 03:29.276
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know it hurts.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.277
I know it hurts, hold still.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.645
Oh, it hurts so bad.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.046
<i>How did you
manage to burn yourself</i>

03:33.047 --> 03:33.847
all the way up there?

03:33.848 --> 03:34.948
What were you doing?

03:34.949 --> 03:36.083
I was just grabbing the pan.

03:36.084 --> 03:38.385
Okay, breathe.
Just breathe while I do this.

03:38.386 --> 03:39.620
The good news
is it's only a burn.

03:39.621 --> 03:43.557
My hand hurts like hell,
but this is not the end for me.

03:43.558 --> 03:45.325
I'm here to win
this competition,

03:45.326 --> 03:47.327
so I am not giving up.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.062
It's just real quick...
I know you wanna

03:49.063 --> 03:49.596
get back out there.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.898
Good luck.

03:50.899 --> 03:51.899
Thank you.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.967
Keep that one dry.

03:53.968 --> 03:55.068
Hey, you okay, Kimmie?

03:55.069 --> 03:56.236
Yeah, I'm good.

03:56.237 --> 03:57.704
Yay, Kimmie.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.206
I like Kimmie.

03:59.207 --> 04:00.006
She came back
with, like, a 2-inch burn

04:00.007 --> 04:02.642
on her hand,
but she's fighting back.

04:02.643 --> 04:03.977
That's some dedication.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.578
You go, girl.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.113
Everyone's,
like, "go, Kimmie!"

04:07.114 --> 04:07.680
Are you kidding me?

04:07.681 --> 04:08.748
She's a baby.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.885
She is a crybaby.

04:11.886 --> 04:13.286
All right, ladies, let's go.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.020
Yes, chef.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.054
Kimmie, concentrate.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.154
Yes, chef.

04:16.156 --> 04:17.923
I'm about to bounce back.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.392
I know I can do this,
burnt hand or not.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.461
I'm gonna rock out
on this meat station.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.730
You got this, girl.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.632
James?
Yes, chef?

04:25.633 --> 04:27.800
Open steak night in Hell's Kitchen,
please, let's go.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.002
Yes, chef, delighted to.

<i>It's steak
night at Hell's Kitchen,</i>

04:40.714 --> 04:41.781
and family night as well.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.283
Tonight's special menu

04:43.284 --> 04:45.218
features a rib eye steak

04:45.219 --> 04:46.886
with fingerling potatoes
and sauteed spinach

04:46.887 --> 04:48.988
topped with a fried egg.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.291
A grilled hanger
steak served with truffle fries

04:51.292 --> 04:53.259
and herbed compound butter.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.128
And Justin's
challenge-winning filet mignon.

04:55.129 --> 04:58.431
And for the young
diners, there's also a kid's menu.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.799
You ready, honey?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.501
I'm gonna have the ravioli.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.602
Cheeseburger.

05:02.603 --> 05:03.870
Cheeseburger.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.872
<i>Cheeseburger, all right.</i>

05:05.873 --> 05:07.774
As a special treat,
each child will also receive

05:07.775 --> 05:09.409
a mini-pizza appetizer.

05:09.410 --> 05:14.013
I wonder if the blue
will win or the red?

05:14.014 --> 05:16.516
Here we go, six tables...
table 31, two children.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.450
Two pizzas, fire.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.985
Yes, chef.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.320
Yes, two smoked salmon,
two shrimp cocktails.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.120
Yes, chef!

05:21.121 --> 05:22.488
Let's go, ladies.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.890
Yes, chef.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.358
Uh, blue team,
two tables... table 21.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.392
<i>Four white salads,</i>

05:26.393 --> 05:27.226
two pizza.

05:27.227 --> 05:29.228
Yes, chef, two pizzas coming.

05:29.229 --> 05:31.698
I come from New York City,
and let me tell you something.

05:31.699 --> 05:34.133
I grew up in a pizzeria,
so I got a little experience,

05:34.134 --> 05:36.080
to say the very least.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.005
<i>Look-it!
Mom, look.</i>

05:43.043 --> 05:45.645
In all honesty,
I was kind of enjoying myself.

05:45.646 --> 05:46.879
Coming right now, chef.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.348
Come on, Clemenza.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.116
Great pizzas...
salads please, let's go.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.818
Pizza's out.

05:51.819 --> 05:54.320
While the
bambinos on the blue side

05:54.321 --> 05:54.954
Are already
enjoying Clemenza's pizza...

05:54.955 --> 05:56.723
That is good.

05:56.724 --> 06:00.693
Young diners on the
red side have been left waiting.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.762
<i>There's a lovely
little lady there</i>

06:02.763 --> 06:03.529
<i>waiting for her pizza.</i>

06:03.530 --> 06:04.797
Come on, Tiffany!

06:04.798 --> 06:06.065
Yes, chef!

06:06.066 --> 06:07.233
<i>You're so slow!</i>

06:07.234 --> 06:08.201
Yes, chef.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.003
I really hate cooking
for children.

06:10.004 --> 06:12.238
Kids don't know
what fine dining is,

06:12.239 --> 06:14.774
so their opinions
really don't matter to me.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.109
That's burnt, look.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.644
<i>Just cut that part off.</i>

06:17.645 --> 06:18.745
<i>Who gives a .</i>

06:18.746 --> 06:21.848
I really don't
like kids at all.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.282
Pizza... how long?

06:23.283 --> 06:24.617
Coming right now, chef.

06:24.618 --> 06:25.251
Come on, please!

06:25.252 --> 06:26.486
Yes, chef.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.421
You are doing
the pizza to serve first.

06:28.422 --> 06:29.889
This side's all right.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.624
But, like,
I don't wanna eat that.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.126
It's for kids, , eh?

06:33.127 --> 06:34.794
<i>Staff!
Yes, chef?</i>

06:34.795 --> 06:36.663
Now we're selling burnt pizza.

06:36.664 --> 06:40.061
Not crispy and delicious.

06:40.062 --> 06:41.718
burnt.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.638
What is going on?

06:45.639 --> 06:47.173
All of you, get a grip.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.175
Yes, chef.
Yes, chef.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.576
Ow, you just
hit me in the head.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.978
Ow.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.180
The more I
work with Tiffany,

06:54.181 --> 06:56.883
the more I wonder
why she's a chef.

06:56.884 --> 06:59.986
So I'm getting the station
back on track.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.821
One pizza, urgently please.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.256
Yes, chef, here's
your next pizza up.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.090
<i>Let's go, ladies.</i>

07:04.091 --> 07:07.560
<i>Yes, chef, I got it.</i>

07:07.561 --> 07:11.064
I hate the stupid looks
she gives to people.

07:11.065 --> 07:13.266
I can't stand it no more.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.735
I've just had it
with Barbie's attitude.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.036
Like, she thinks
she's bad or something.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.304
Pizza's coming out.

07:18.305 --> 07:19.605
<i>Here you go.</i>

07:19.606 --> 07:21.374
Pizza, chef.

07:21.375 --> 07:23.776
<i>Thank you so much,
table 50, please, let's go.</i>

07:23.777 --> 07:25.011
Get off you're
high horse.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.713
You're not good at cooking.

07:26.714 --> 07:28.614
Like, ugh!
I Hate her.

07:28.615 --> 07:29.949
One more pizza!

07:29.950 --> 07:30.283
<i>Pizza coming, chef.</i>

07:30.284 --> 07:32.151
Let's go.

07:32.152 --> 07:35.021
While Barbie steps up
to save Tiffany's pizza station...

07:35.022 --> 07:36.389
Pizza's in.

07:36.390 --> 07:37.990
On the blue side...

07:37.991 --> 07:39.225
Let's go, blue team.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.827
<i>4 coming
your way, table 20.</i>

07:40.828 --> 07:41.227
Two red salad,
two smoked salmon.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.695
Yes, chef.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.097
It's now up to
Brian on appetizers to keep

07:44.098 --> 07:46.532
the positive momentum going.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.201
<i>Let's go!
Get those bellinis up.</i>

07:48.202 --> 07:49.802
Get the bellinis out first.

07:49.803 --> 07:50.970
Wait, get the bellinis out.

07:50.971 --> 07:51.804
All right,
all right, don't worry.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.580
My style in the
kitchen is very light.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.515
I do a lot of voices
all the time,

08:02.516 --> 08:03.716
and the guys love it.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.322
Just shut the up, man.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.590
It's not even funny, honestly.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.091
Brian, tell me when
you're a few away, man.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.864
What... I...

08:17.865 --> 08:19.465
What the
did he just say?

08:19.466 --> 08:21.100
I have no idea.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.835
Brian's an annoying
kind of a .

08:25.272 --> 08:27.206
I've had enough of his .

08:27.207 --> 08:28.407
Either shut your
pie hole,

08:28.408 --> 08:30.176
or learn how to communicate.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.277
<i>I always wanted
to make bellinis.</i>

08:31.278 --> 08:32.678
<i>Ever since I
was a little boy.</i>

08:32.679 --> 08:33.913
Smoked salmon!

08:33.914 --> 08:35.148
Answer him!

08:35.149 --> 08:36.482
Smoked salmon!
Smoked salmon!

08:36.482 --> 08:37.517
Coming right up, chef.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.485
I've got bellinis.

08:39.486 --> 08:40.886
bellinis, ready.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.455
Don't make
the bellinis too small.

08:42.456 --> 08:44.490
They're kind of
lonely on there.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.325
Want me to make some more?
Make some more.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.693
How can you set something
on that size? Look!

08:47.694 --> 08:49.028
Yes, chef!
Yes, chef!

08:49.029 --> 08:49.996
It needs to be there.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.330
<i>Yes, chef!</i>

08:51.331 --> 08:52.832
I gotta make more,
uh, new bellinis.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.133
<i>So give me a sec.</i>

08:54.134 --> 08:55.168
Eight bellinis away.

08:55.169 --> 08:58.304
You make something so simple
look so difficult.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.405
Yes, chef!

08:59.406 --> 09:01.207
<i>Stay with it, bri!</i>

09:01.208 --> 09:02.108
Concentrate.
Brian, pay attention.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.643
Please. Keep making
bellinis, let's go.

09:03.644 --> 09:04.944
Flop, flop.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.412
The flavors are very nice.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.080
Oh.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.383
Unbelievable.

09:10.384 --> 09:12.618
<i>Oh, just
shut up, Brian.</i>

09:12.619 --> 09:13.753
<i>Hey!</i>

09:13.754 --> 09:14.821
I've got one big imitation!

09:14.822 --> 09:16.255
Yes, chef!

09:16.256 --> 09:17.557
Try imitating being
a chef for two minutes!

09:17.558 --> 09:18.791
Yes, chef!

09:18.792 --> 09:19.926
<i>Yes?
Yes!</i>

09:19.927 --> 09:20.660
Brian, how long?

09:20.661 --> 09:22.261
It's ready, chef.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.297
Give it to me
then you idiot!

09:24.298 --> 09:25.631
<i>Yes chef, it's
coming right now.</i>

09:25.632 --> 09:26.499
Smoked salmon.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.234
Dude, not so
sloppy either, Brian.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.335
<i>Yes, chef.
off, Brian, yeah?</i>

09:29.336 --> 09:30.036
Yes, chef.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.437
Seriously, enough's enough.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.839
While I like your funny side,

09:32.840 --> 09:34.073
I wanna see
your serious side now.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.208
<i>Yes, chef!</i>

09:35.209 --> 09:36.309
<i>Or off.
Yes, chef!</i>

09:36.310 --> 09:36.709
I got it, chef.

09:36.710 --> 09:37.977
me.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.513
Unbelievable.

09:40.514 --> 09:43.249
While Brian
tries to get serious,

09:43.250 --> 09:46.285
over in the red kitchen,
Tiffany...

09:46.286 --> 09:48.588
Is attempting
to redeem herself

09:48.589 --> 09:51.324
on appetizers.

09:51.325 --> 09:53.392
We're waiting on the bellinis,
30 seconds, chef.

09:53.393 --> 09:54.827
Come on, Tiffany,
you gotta speed up

09:54.828 --> 09:56.229
a little bit then.

09:56.230 --> 09:57.930
<i>It's like you're
fast asleep on there.</i>

09:57.931 --> 09:59.599
Yes, chef.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.634
About 20 seconds, chef!

10:01.635 --> 10:04.170
Tiffany just has
no respect for the food.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.771
I don't think they're
gonna take those. Yeah.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.240
<i>Who cares, Dana.</i>

10:07.241 --> 10:08.908
<i>Let's go!</i>

10:08.909 --> 10:10.643
She doesn't care
about anything.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.079
The only thing I have
seen her passionate about

10:13.080 --> 10:17.783
<i>in Hell's Kitchen
is a cigarette.</i>

10:17.784 --> 10:19.285
Shrimp cocktails done!

10:19.286 --> 10:21.153
I'm taking two smoked salmon.

10:21.154 --> 10:21.954
Bring it up
right away, let's go.

10:21.955 --> 10:22.989
Walking, walking!

10:22.990 --> 10:24.090
Right behind.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.525
Two smoked salmons.

10:26.526 --> 10:27.827
Hey, ladies.

10:27.828 --> 10:28.861
<i>All of you, come here.</i>

10:28.862 --> 10:30.563
Come here.

10:30.564 --> 10:32.665
The secret of a good kitchen,
a good chef is consistency.

10:32.666 --> 10:33.099
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

10:33.100 --> 10:34.300
What is this?

10:34.301 --> 10:35.635
You can't give me a perfect one

10:35.636 --> 10:36.602
and one one.

10:36.603 --> 10:37.770
That's my fault, chef.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.005
<i>Oh, Tiffany.</i>

10:39.006 --> 10:41.140
off, ladies, yeah?

10:41.141 --> 10:43.709
Can more than one of you
start making bellinis?

10:43.710 --> 10:45.544
Yes, chef, I'm making bellinis.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.179
Can someone start
leading a little bit?

10:47.180 --> 10:48.915
Yes, chef, I got 'em.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.650
Once again, it's pandemonium.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.151
So okay, I'll fix it.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.287
I'm about there with bellinis.

10:54.288 --> 10:57.089
I just can't take it anymore,
like, I don't want help.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.624
Barbie thinks
she runs this place.

10:58.625 --> 10:59.825
I've just had it.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.360
Two smoked salmon coming.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.095
Here you go.

11:03.096 --> 11:03.930
<i>Service please,
two smoked salmon.</i>

11:03.931 --> 11:06.198
Go... go, go, go.
Nice, very good.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.100
<i>Yes, chef.
Very nice indeed.</i>

11:08.101 --> 11:08.501
Perfect bellinis, chef.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.669
Okay!

11:09.670 --> 11:11.237
God.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.372
<i>That is some
attitude.</i>

11:13.373 --> 11:14.340
<i>All right,
all right, guys.</i>

11:14.341 --> 11:16.275
Barbie steps up once again,

11:16.276 --> 11:18.844
and red diners are enjoying
their appetizers.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.947
Meanwhile,
on the blue team, Clemenza...

11:20.948 --> 11:23.783
It's coming!
Justin...

11:23.784 --> 11:25.651
That's the first
order of bellinis?

11:25.652 --> 11:26.619
And Brian...

11:26.620 --> 11:28.120
Bellinis will be up
in three seconds, man.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.022
Have hit their stride.
Behind you, chef.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.290
And appetizers are
flying out of the kitchen.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.592
Hey, blue team, the
appetizers are rolling out.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.294
Now we're hitting
the entrees, let's go.

11:35.295 --> 11:35.828
<i>Three filet, three rib eye.</i>

11:35.829 --> 11:37.263
Yes, chef!

11:37.264 --> 11:39.198
It's time to start
showing chef Ramsay

11:39.199 --> 11:40.833
I mean business.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.668
It's steak night,
and this is what.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.603
"Gordon Ramsay's Steak"
in Las Vegas is all about,

11:44.604 --> 11:48.541
so I'm bringing energy,
stamina, passion, drive,

11:48.542 --> 11:51.911
commitment, and team.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.813
Chef, rib eyes on your right.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.047
Right behind you
with the garnish!

11:55.048 --> 11:56.282
No sear.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.917
Look at the color on there.

11:57.918 --> 11:58.951
Look at it,
it's like boiled meat.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.320
Oh, off, guys.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.922
<i>All of you, come here.</i>

12:02.923 --> 12:03.956
Look at the meat.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.424
<i>No sear.</i>

12:05.425 --> 12:06.859
Just, like, boiled.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.194
Where's the sear?

12:08.195 --> 12:09.528
I'll get it right, chef.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.796
Tonight is steak night,
let's go!

12:10.797 --> 12:12.031
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

12:12.032 --> 12:14.233
While Patrick
re-fires his rib eyes...

12:14.234 --> 12:15.868
Oh, brother.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.670
Over in the red kitchen...

12:17.671 --> 12:18.604
I want it now,
two filet, two hanger steak.

12:18.605 --> 12:19.605
Yes, chef!

12:19.606 --> 12:21.540
Let's go.

12:21.541 --> 12:24.443
It's now up to Kimmie
on meat and Robyn on the grill

12:24.444 --> 12:26.045
to get entrees
moving out of the red kitchen.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.413
Two filets...
what was the other one?

12:27.414 --> 12:28.214
Two filet, two hanger, right?

12:28.215 --> 12:29.048
Yes.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.216
Two filet, two hanger?

12:30.217 --> 12:31.183
Yes!

12:31.184 --> 12:32.918
All right, just making sure.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.253
You don't need
to scream, Robyn.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.921
Robyn is acting crazy
as right now.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.491
I honestly think
she's still holding a grudge

12:38.492 --> 12:41.394
from the challenge
about that rib eye.

12:41.395 --> 12:43.262
<i>Kimmie, let me know
when you're walking, okay?</i>

12:43.263 --> 12:44.597
<i>Sure will!
Kimmie, I'm coming, okay?</i>

12:44.598 --> 12:46.732
Yeah, I'm slicing, dude.
Can I walk?

12:46.733 --> 12:51.504
<i>Uh, give me just one second.</i>

12:51.505 --> 12:54.140
<i>Two minutes, chef, two minutes.</i>

12:54.141 --> 12:56.175
On what?
These steaks are huge.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.643
<i>It's not my fault.</i>

12:57.644 --> 12:59.545
It's not my fault, dude.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.080
Really?

13:01.081 --> 13:02.681
Kimmie doesn't know
what the she's doing.

13:02.682 --> 13:03.983
bitch.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.651
Running!

13:05.652 --> 13:06.952
All right, running.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.921
I got it, I got it.

13:08.922 --> 13:09.922
Bitch.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.624
Ugh.

13:11.625 --> 13:12.625
There we go.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.026
No, nowhere near.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.728
<i>Oh, .</i>

13:15.729 --> 13:17.163
Here we go, it's going down!

13:17.164 --> 13:18.731
Kimmie's gonna get yelled at.

13:18.732 --> 13:20.433
This is gonna
be a crime, folks.

13:20.434 --> 13:22.234
Get the popcorn
'cause it's about to get good.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.836
<i>All of you!
Yes, chef.</i>

13:23.837 --> 13:25.404
<i>Come here.</i>

13:25.405 --> 13:26.906
Hey, look, we can't even
get steak cooked.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.809
It's badly sliced.
Who did what here?

13:29.810 --> 13:31.811
Kimmie, Robyn, look at me.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.979
Who done it, then?

13:38.884 --> 13:43.187
<i>It's an hour and a half
into Hell's Kitchen steak night.</i>

13:43.188 --> 13:44.789
The red team has delivered

13:44.790 --> 13:46.691
their first entrees
to the pass.

13:46.692 --> 13:48.626
<i>All of you!
Yes, chef!</i>

13:48.627 --> 13:51.195
We can't even get steak cooked.

13:51.196 --> 13:53.131
But chef Ramsay has a
question for Kimmie and Robyn.

13:53.132 --> 13:54.966
Who did what here?
I did the filets.

13:54.967 --> 13:56.667
I cut the steak, chef.

13:56.668 --> 13:58.703
Look at the way it's sliced.

13:58.704 --> 14:00.037
<i>Looks like it's been
cut with a spoon.</i>

14:00.038 --> 14:01.272
It's not even sliced there.

14:01.273 --> 14:03.174
And then next to it,
where's the filet?

14:03.175 --> 14:06.010
That's cut beautifully.
Sliced beautifully.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.045
Hell, yeah!

14:08.046 --> 14:09.947
I knew my was right.

14:09.948 --> 14:13.417
Robyn is up,
and I'm just outshining her.

14:13.418 --> 14:15.153
<i>I've got
one up right now,</i>

14:15.154 --> 14:16.120
watch out, guys.

14:16.121 --> 14:17.355
How much simpler
do I have to make it?

14:17.356 --> 14:18.723
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

14:18.724 --> 14:19.757
I need a cut here.

14:19.758 --> 14:20.958
Slice and knife, please.

14:20.959 --> 14:23.027
You're killin' me, man.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.163
While Kimmie and
Robyn start over on their first

14:25.164 --> 14:26.998
table of entrees,
in the blue kitchen...

14:26.999 --> 14:30.668
Patrick is desperate to impress
with his re-fired rib eyes.

14:30.669 --> 14:32.203
Going up to the pass,
behind you.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.939
Behind, chef.

14:34.940 --> 14:37.675
I start off rough
with under-seared steaks.

14:37.676 --> 14:40.111
I know I'm making mistakes,
but I know it have it in me.

14:40.112 --> 14:43.848
I know I'm a special chef.

14:43.849 --> 14:45.716
Finally! Hello!

14:45.717 --> 14:47.318
That's the way to sear meat.

14:47.319 --> 14:48.920
Thank you, chef.

14:48.921 --> 14:50.521
Whoo!
I'm so happy.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.356
I got this now,
I'm back on track.

14:52.357 --> 14:54.458
<i>Service, please.</i>

14:54.459 --> 14:57.428
Blue team, away.
Table 22, yeah? Concentrate.

14:57.429 --> 14:59.230
Three filet with hanger steak.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.999
Yes, chef, four minutes.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.968
Royce deoesn't even answer.

15:03.969 --> 15:05.837
Three filet, one hanger!

15:05.838 --> 15:06.938
Three filet, one hanger!
Three filet, one hanger.

15:06.939 --> 15:08.072
One more time!

15:08.073 --> 15:09.740
Three filet, one hanger!

15:09.741 --> 15:11.409
One more time!
Three filet, one hanger!

15:11.410 --> 15:12.910
One more time!
Three filet, one hanger!

15:12.911 --> 15:14.011
<i>I got two minutes on mine!</i>

15:15.414 --> 15:18.182
Yeah, give me three minutes,
chef on...

15:18.183 --> 15:20.051
<i>On what?
Two filet, one hanger!</i>

15:20.052 --> 15:21.853
Oh, my God!

15:21.854 --> 15:24.222
Three filets! Sorry...
three filets, one hanger!

15:24.223 --> 15:26.057
Oh, my... hey,
you twit.

15:26.058 --> 15:28.092
Hey, come here, you.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.727
!

15:29.728 --> 15:31.462
Hey, you... you
in front of me, let's go.

15:31.463 --> 15:33.064
<i>Patrick, off!</i>

15:33.065 --> 15:33.998
Oh, me.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.333
!

15:35.334 --> 15:36.634
Hey, outside,
get some fresh air.

15:36.635 --> 15:37.134
off.

15:45.410 --> 15:47.612
It's a stupid bonehead move.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.281
And I-I can't believe
with all my experience,

15:50.282 --> 15:52.049
I up like that.
I can't believe it.

15:52.050 --> 15:54.752
I can't.

15:54.753 --> 15:57.188
I know I've made
my mistakes in the kitchen,

15:57.189 --> 15:58.489
but I do not quit,
and I always fight.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.591
I can get this right.

16:00.592 --> 16:04.528
Chef, may I come back
to the kitchen?

16:04.529 --> 16:06.330
Get on there, you!
Yes, chef!

16:06.331 --> 16:07.665
What's going?

16:07.666 --> 16:09.267
<i>Three filet, one hanger!</i>

16:09.268 --> 16:10.101
There you go!
How long on that hanger?

16:10.102 --> 16:11.602
<i>Coming out right now.</i>

16:11.603 --> 16:13.571
With Patrick
back in the game

16:13.572 --> 16:15.072
on the meat station,
over in the red kitchen...

16:15.073 --> 16:16.474
Walking with filets.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.409
Hangers walking up!

16:18.410 --> 16:20.244
Robyn is ready
with her hanger re-fire,

16:20.245 --> 16:22.146
and the red team
is praying that it is worthy

16:22.147 --> 16:24.949
of being sent out
by chef Ramsay.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.384
Nice, very good.

16:26.385 --> 16:28.886
<i>Service, please.
Here we go.</i>

16:28.887 --> 16:30.888
<i>On order, ticket
for table 64, rib eye,</i>

16:30.889 --> 16:31.856
<i>loup de mer and filet.</i>

16:31.857 --> 16:33.691
Yes, chef!

16:33.692 --> 16:35.393
The red team
is ready to move on

16:35.394 --> 16:36.527
to their second table,
and chef Ramsay...

16:36.528 --> 16:38.863
Can you ladies
pick it up at all?

16:38.864 --> 16:40.998
Is hoping that the red
kitchen has finally found their rhythm.

16:40.999 --> 16:42.566
How long?
I'm ready to slice.

16:42.567 --> 16:44.835
I'm ready with the fish.
Can I run?

16:44.836 --> 16:45.903
Yeah, go.

16:45.904 --> 16:47.471
Behind, running now!

16:47.472 --> 16:48.572
Are you serious?

16:48.573 --> 16:49.974
What's the matter, girl?

16:49.975 --> 16:51.642
It would have been
information that would have

16:51.643 --> 16:52.944
been useful
a minute ago.

16:52.945 --> 16:55.079
Hey, I need, uh, I just
need a minute, Christina.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.081
I'm with you.

16:57.082 --> 16:58.783
You just told me to run.

16:58.784 --> 17:00.384
She just told me
to run the fish out.

17:00.385 --> 17:01.719
Are you kidding me?

17:01.720 --> 17:06.022
Are you kidding me?

17:06.023 --> 17:08.425
But she just heard it,
you said "run."

17:08.426 --> 17:10.627
I didn't hear
your garnish, Robyn.

17:10.628 --> 17:11.829
Christina.

17:11.829 --> 17:13.531
it,
it, I'm with you.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.199
When are you
gonna be ready, babe?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.001
45 seconds on.

17:17.002 --> 17:19.270
<i>45 seconds to the window heard.
Yes, thank you.</i>

17:19.271 --> 17:23.503
Oh, my God.
My fish is dying.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.944
This is where
the sabotage starts.

17:27.945 --> 17:29.947
Christina, how long, baby?

17:29.948 --> 17:30.948
You ready?

17:30.949 --> 17:32.350
Yeah.

17:32.351 --> 17:35.953
Go with sauce, walk the sauce.

17:35.954 --> 17:38.589
Filet, rib eye.

17:38.590 --> 17:41.058
Honestly,
it gets worse.

17:41.059 --> 17:43.027
<i>All of you come here.</i>

17:43.028 --> 17:44.729
Just touch that fish there.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.397
<i>Just touch how dry.</i>

17:46.398 --> 17:48.566
It's got more
wrinkles on it than I have,

17:48.567 --> 17:50.301
and I'm 44 years of age.

17:50.302 --> 17:52.069
That should be
cooked fresh!

17:52.070 --> 17:54.271
He's not gonna yell at us,

17:54.272 --> 17:56.540
he's yelling
at one of the chefs.

17:56.541 --> 17:58.142
How long ago did you cook that?

17:58.143 --> 17:59.443
Three minutes ago!

17:59.444 --> 18:01.645
Three minutes ago.
Yes, chef.

18:01.646 --> 18:03.414
That's fresh
three minutes ago? Touch.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.082
That is nasty.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.952
I took it off three minutes ago
and I covered it.

18:07.953 --> 18:09.120
So... Again!
All right.

18:09.121 --> 18:10.488
When did you cook it?

18:10.489 --> 18:11.889
Seven minutes ago then.

18:11.890 --> 18:12.857
Oh, seven minutes ago.

18:12.858 --> 18:15.026
Well, I took it off
three minutes ago.

18:15.027 --> 18:16.660
So four minutes for it to cook,
so seven minutes ago, chef.

18:16.661 --> 18:19.263
Yeah, maybe 17 minutes ago.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.465
You've gotta be
out of your mind

18:21.466 --> 18:22.333
to lie to chef Ramsay
because he knows.

18:22.334 --> 18:23.734
He's not stupid.

18:23.735 --> 18:25.069
What's going on
with the fish, Kimmie?

18:25.070 --> 18:25.803
I gotta re-fire it.

18:25.804 --> 18:26.971
Three minutes.

18:26.972 --> 18:27.972
Get rid of that .

18:27.973 --> 18:30.808
I wouldn't even feed
that to my cat!

18:30.809 --> 18:33.010
While the women
start over on entrees...

18:33.011 --> 18:34.345
off, Robyn.

18:34.346 --> 18:36.981
Their hungry
diners grow hungrier.

18:36.982 --> 18:38.516
<i>Where's the dinner?</i>

18:38.517 --> 18:40.084
I mean, what time is it?

18:40.085 --> 18:41.886
Meanwhile, in the blue kitchen,

18:41.887 --> 18:44.021
the men are looking
to rally once again.

18:44.022 --> 18:47.391
But first, chef Ramsay has
a little quiz for Patrick.

18:47.392 --> 18:48.826
What's going?

18:51.400 --> 18:53.206
Three filet, one hanger.

18:53.207 --> 18:54.432
I want this table
coming together

18:54.433 --> 18:56.467
at the same time.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.835
<i>Yes, chef.
Got it?</i>

18:57.836 --> 18:59.303
Yes, chef!

18:59.304 --> 19:01.739
Chef Ramsay is all over
Patrick right now.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.941
All right, get your head
back in the game, let's go!

19:03.942 --> 19:05.443
But I think that's
because he sees a lot in him.

19:05.444 --> 19:07.678
Beautiful, Patrick,
that's beautiful, man.

19:07.679 --> 19:09.713
Gotta slice!
I come back in with a fire.

19:09.714 --> 19:11.782
I'm, like,
I'm gonna nail this .

19:11.783 --> 19:13.284
I've got a few more tables
left to go, I'm not giving up.

19:13.285 --> 19:15.086
I know I've got
all my steaks working.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.121
<i>Let's go, come on,
we can't lose it now.</i>

19:17.122 --> 19:18.589
Oh, me.

19:18.590 --> 19:20.825
Chef, walking past
with two filets!

19:20.826 --> 19:23.894
I put three steaks up and
the last one was rare.

19:23.895 --> 19:25.996
Giovanni, I have two
but I'm bringing back one more.

19:25.997 --> 19:26.664
<i>30 seconds.</i>

19:26.665 --> 19:28.199
Hell no.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.358
I've got two filet here,
please tell me...

19:29.359 --> 19:30.361
It's coming up right now, chef!

19:30.362 --> 19:31.699
<i>I asked for
them at the same time,</i>

19:31.700 --> 19:33.065
<i>where's the filets?
It's not there.</i>

19:33.066 --> 19:35.272
I know, chef.
Oh, hell.

19:35.273 --> 19:36.474
I know I'm in trouble.

19:36.475 --> 19:37.741
I'm my pants right now.

19:37.742 --> 19:40.681
I've got a 50/50 chance
I'm gonna get my ass

19:40.682 --> 19:41.745
handed to me.

19:44.702 --> 19:46.040
raw.

19:47.116 --> 19:48.531
Hey.

19:49.221 --> 19:50.654
Come here, you.

19:50.655 --> 19:52.323
Is that what
you served me today?

19:52.324 --> 19:53.357
No, chef.

19:53.358 --> 19:56.327
!

19:56.328 --> 19:59.396
Uh, chef, I'm sorry, it's raw.

19:59.397 --> 20:01.665
Not good, not good.

20:01.666 --> 20:03.601
It's raw?

20:03.602 --> 20:05.936
Really?

20:12.142 --> 20:14.443
It's two
hours into steak night,

20:14.444 --> 20:16.412
and after blowing
his second chance

20:16.413 --> 20:18.914
on the meat station...
It's raw?

20:18.915 --> 20:20.683
Patrick won't
be getting a third.

20:20.684 --> 20:21.484
Get out!

20:21.485 --> 20:23.219
!

20:23.220 --> 20:26.188
Really?
!

20:26.189 --> 20:28.591
Patrick was, uh,
in his head tonight

20:28.592 --> 20:31.360
and he just couldn't
seem to bounce back.

20:31.361 --> 20:33.162
He was frickin' scared tonight.

20:34.631 --> 20:36.799
I'm sorry, girls.
I'm sorry, honey.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.734
I keep letting my family down.

20:38.735 --> 20:41.904
I'm sorry.

20:41.905 --> 20:46.075
It is very frustrating because
they have so much faith in me,

20:46.076 --> 20:49.245
and they were
so proud of me to go here

20:49.246 --> 20:53.249
and fulfill a dream.

20:54.684 --> 20:58.487
And I'm blowing it!

20:58.488 --> 20:59.722
I'm sorry.

21:01.958 --> 21:05.594
I'm sorry.

21:07.164 --> 21:08.998
Chef, filet coming
at you right now, chef!

21:08.999 --> 21:10.065
Here's your filet, chef.

21:10.066 --> 21:11.700
Service, please.

21:11.701 --> 21:13.669
Justin has
come to the rescue

21:13.670 --> 21:15.738
and beautifully cooked steaks
are once again

21:15.739 --> 21:17.706
making their way
out to the dining room.

21:17.707 --> 21:20.910
It's really good.
Go team blue, go team blue.

21:20.911 --> 21:23.646
Meanwhile, all the red
team needs to get their second table

21:23.647 --> 21:25.214
of entrees out,
is for Robyn and Kimmie

21:25.215 --> 21:27.049
to work together.

21:27.050 --> 21:28.951
How long?
A minute.

21:28.952 --> 21:31.985
Kimmie and Robyn need to
pull their together,

21:31.986 --> 21:33.189
or we're gonna be screwed.

21:33.190 --> 21:35.191
<i>How long on
the loup and the filet?</i>

21:35.192 --> 21:36.926
How long... a minute!

21:36.927 --> 21:37.993
A minute,
Christina, a minute.

21:37.994 --> 21:39.328
Yes, chef.

21:39.329 --> 21:40.930
I just kissed it so
we're walking in 30 seconds.

21:40.931 --> 21:42.264
30 seconds, fast!

21:42.265 --> 21:43.999
<i>Yes?</i>

21:44.000 --> 21:45.100
Yeah, I'm just
waiting to slice, dude.

21:45.101 --> 21:46.469
Slice it!

21:46.470 --> 21:48.204
I'm not ready to slice it yet.

21:48.205 --> 21:49.772
<i>I got it, I'm
not ready to slice it.</i>

21:49.773 --> 21:52.041
But you said a minute, Kimmie,
And that's a minute.

21:52.042 --> 21:53.776
getting me
all off on my fish!

21:53.777 --> 21:55.578
Hey, you two, come here.

21:55.579 --> 21:57.012
What's going on?

21:57.013 --> 21:58.514
Come here!
What's going on here?

21:58.515 --> 21:59.815
She said two minutes,
so then I...

21:59.816 --> 22:02.284
It's resting.
It's resting.

22:02.285 --> 22:03.953
So then you said
a minute and a half.

22:03.954 --> 22:05.187
Right, and I'm gonna
slice in a minute.

22:05.188 --> 22:07.857
Because then Christina's ready.
A minute's passed already.

22:07.858 --> 22:09.525
My fish is dying because
a minute's really two minutes.

22:09.526 --> 22:11.327
No, it's not,
dude, I'm counting.

22:11.328 --> 22:12.928
All right, I'm wrong.

22:12.929 --> 22:14.797
Yeah, you are.
I'm not wrong!

22:14.798 --> 22:16.999
Wow. Can you get it
together?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.434
bitch.

22:18.435 --> 22:20.236
She's really
starting to piss me off.

22:20.237 --> 22:22.171
Service, please.

22:22.172 --> 22:23.105
Despite their
constant bickering,

22:23.106 --> 22:26.008
somehow Robyn and Kimmie
get it right.

22:26.009 --> 22:27.676
And entrees
are leaving the kitchen.

22:27.677 --> 22:28.677
Really good.

22:28.678 --> 22:29.945
Very nice.

22:29.946 --> 22:31.647
Meanwhile, in the blue kitchen.

22:31.648 --> 22:33.048
Two loup de mer,
two hanger steak.

22:33.049 --> 22:35.050
Yes, chef!
Let's go.

22:35.051 --> 22:36.852
Chef Ramsay is
counting on Royce on the grill

22:36.853 --> 22:38.521
to keep up the pace.

22:38.522 --> 22:40.222
Two loup de mer, two hanger.

22:40.223 --> 22:41.824
Yes, chef, three minutes.

22:41.825 --> 22:43.926
I'm very good at cooking steak.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.628
I definitely feel
that I'm the Rolls-Royce

22:45.629 --> 22:47.363
of cooking.

22:47.364 --> 22:49.398
I got... I got two hangers going
up now.

22:49.399 --> 22:50.566
Make sure it's cooked
correctly, okay?

22:50.567 --> 22:53.168
I'm really good
at meat temperatures.

22:53.169 --> 22:55.237
You just see how it cooks,
you're in... one with the meat.

22:55.238 --> 22:58.707
You melt with it.

22:58.708 --> 23:00.910
raw.

23:00.911 --> 23:02.578
All of you, come here!

23:02.579 --> 23:03.579
All of you!

23:03.580 --> 23:04.847
Yes, chef!

23:04.848 --> 23:08.083
A hanger steak,
raw and perfect.

23:08.084 --> 23:09.852
I knew it was
too good to be true.

23:09.853 --> 23:11.954
Hey, you, Rolls-Royce...

23:11.955 --> 23:13.722
off!

23:13.723 --> 23:16.191
Why the did
he kick me out for nothing?

23:16.192 --> 23:17.726
I pushed all
my out perfect

23:17.727 --> 23:19.061
until one table.

23:19.062 --> 23:20.796
I mean, come on.

23:20.797 --> 23:22.064
I don't get why he never
gives me one extra chance.

23:22.065 --> 23:27.036
With Royce and
Patrick sidelined in the dorm,

23:27.037 --> 23:29.138
the remaining members
of the blue team...

23:29.139 --> 23:31.106
Coming up!
Clemenza, you okay?

23:31.107 --> 23:32.808
I'm ready any time
you are, I'm ready.

23:32.809 --> 23:33.943
Pushed to
complete dinner service.

23:33.944 --> 23:36.278
Garnish up, guys!

23:36.279 --> 23:38.514
Let's do this.
What's the next one?

23:38.515 --> 23:40.616
Meanwhile, over
in the red kitchen...

23:40.617 --> 23:41.917
You're not even
communicating, Kimmie.

23:41.918 --> 23:43.052
Your minutes are not minutes.

23:43.053 --> 23:44.720
Yeah, it is.
I know how to count... do you?

23:44.721 --> 23:46.488
The women continue
to serve up just as much

23:46.489 --> 23:47.990
attitude as food.

23:47.991 --> 23:49.959
Two hanger steak,
two loup de mer,

23:49.960 --> 23:51.193
one rib eye, one cheeseburger.

23:51.194 --> 23:51.961
Yes, chef!

23:51.962 --> 23:53.495
Kimmie...

23:53.496 --> 23:54.863
Let me know when we're
gonna walk together, okay?

23:54.864 --> 23:56.098
Did you hear me, Kimmie?

23:56.099 --> 23:57.900
Oh, my God, Robyn, just
stop talking to me, for real.

23:57.901 --> 23:59.335
Oh, girl, don't even
go there with me.

23:59.336 --> 24:01.870
Oh, my God.

24:01.871 --> 24:03.195
We need to work as a team.

24:03.196 --> 24:04.415
And you can't do that
because you have

24:04.416 --> 24:05.530
a personal problem with me?

24:05.531 --> 24:06.931
Good, I have
a personal problem with you.

24:06.932 --> 24:09.712
I cannot stand
your ass.

24:09.713 --> 24:12.514
me.

24:12.515 --> 24:15.084
My team is like
a anchor on a ship

24:15.085 --> 24:17.553
and we are just going down.

24:17.554 --> 24:19.855
Cheeseburger,
rib eye, filet, okay?

24:19.856 --> 24:22.224
<i>Can I get the french fries
for the cheeseburger?</i>

24:22.225 --> 24:23.592
<i>No, 'cause I have time
on the french fries...</i>

24:23.593 --> 24:25.828
<i>Can you stop
yelling at me?</i>

24:25.829 --> 24:27.830
<i>I am sick of the yelling!</i>

24:27.831 --> 24:29.798
<i>You wanna talk?
Talk!</i>

24:29.799 --> 24:31.200
Do not yell!

24:31.201 --> 24:32.735
<i>Oh, my God, I can't.</i>

24:32.736 --> 24:33.869
Look at you all.

24:33.870 --> 24:37.439
What a sad situation.

24:37.440 --> 24:38.440
Oh, .

24:38.441 --> 24:40.793
Blue team.
Yes, chef.

24:40.794 --> 24:42.099
Come here.
Who needs it?

24:42.100 --> 24:43.876
Justin, on the fish.
Yes, chef.

24:43.877 --> 24:46.749
You on the meat, let's go.

24:46.750 --> 24:48.884
Chef Ramsay does not
need to put the blue team

24:48.885 --> 24:49.783
in our kitchen.

24:52.055 --> 24:54.123
...that the red team
has lost tonight.

24:54.124 --> 24:56.225
I don't need any
help, dude.

24:56.226 --> 24:57.526
I'm good right now.
I don't need nothin'.

24:57.527 --> 24:58.827
Oh, my God.

24:58.828 --> 25:00.129
I don't need anything,
I'm cooking.

25:00.130 --> 25:01.997
All right, I understand.

25:01.998 --> 25:03.132
I don't need...
these are my fish pans.

25:03.133 --> 25:04.133
Leave my fish alone.

25:04.134 --> 25:05.100
Talk to me.
Somebody, anybody.

25:05.101 --> 25:06.435
What do you need?

25:06.436 --> 25:08.370
You guys aren't
even listening to me.

25:08.371 --> 25:10.305
<i>Dude, who
cares, just cook!</i>

25:10.306 --> 25:12.708
They're all yelling,
and screaming, and arguing

25:12.709 --> 25:14.910
and holy .

25:14.911 --> 25:16.478
It is chaos.

25:16.479 --> 25:18.480
Her count on the rib eye
at the second check

25:18.481 --> 25:20.516
is what up my fish.

25:20.517 --> 25:22.384
<i>Just shut the
up and cook.</i>

25:22.385 --> 25:23.488
Hey, hey, hey, there's kids
in the dinning room.

25:23.489 --> 25:26.234
<i>Dude, pull it together.
How long on the rib eye?</i>

25:29.559 --> 25:31.593
You had to go back
because of the the filets

25:31.594 --> 25:32.828
that you up.
Yeah.

25:32.829 --> 25:35.898
Maybe your count up.

25:35.899 --> 25:36.965
crybaby she is.

25:36.966 --> 25:38.400
How long?

25:38.401 --> 25:40.436
<i>Behind, running now.</i>

25:40.437 --> 25:42.371
Walking right behind.
Hangers are up.

25:42.372 --> 25:44.006
They're up? Okay.
Yes.

25:44.007 --> 25:47.576
Go check.
It's up.

25:48.578 --> 25:49.745
Hey.
Hey, hey.

25:49.746 --> 25:52.381
You all just stop.

25:52.382 --> 25:54.516
Come here, all of you.

25:54.517 --> 25:55.951
Just touch them.

25:55.952 --> 25:57.486
<i>Put your hand on top.</i>

25:57.487 --> 25:58.987
Put your hand...
put your hand on top!

25:58.988 --> 26:00.055
I'm putting it on top.
I need to get over there.

26:00.056 --> 26:00.656
Put it on top.

26:00.657 --> 26:01.924
Stone-cold.

26:01.925 --> 26:03.425
<i>Red team...</i>

26:03.426 --> 26:06.862
You, you, you, you, you.
off.

26:06.863 --> 26:09.598
Get out!

26:09.599 --> 26:12.101
This is absolutely unreal to me.

26:12.102 --> 26:14.903
We had such great momentum
up till this day,

26:14.904 --> 26:16.972
and now
it's all down the toilet.

26:16.973 --> 26:18.674
The two fish, I was told
five minutes,

26:18.675 --> 26:20.075
so I fired them.

26:20.076 --> 26:22.010
The meats were off
on the counts.

26:22.011 --> 26:25.414
I am so livid right now.

26:25.415 --> 26:26.949
Oh, my God.

26:26.950 --> 26:29.017
All hell's is going
to break loose.

26:29.018 --> 26:30.419
My fish were dried
because of a missed call.

26:30.420 --> 26:31.920
I'm over it, dude.

26:31.921 --> 26:33.222
I'm over it.

26:33.223 --> 26:35.157
I'm so tired of her bitching.

26:35.158 --> 26:37.526
It's just too much.
It literally drives me nuts.

26:39.462 --> 26:41.430
I'm so pissed.

26:41.431 --> 26:44.466
I can't even listen to...
I can't listen to her.

26:44.467 --> 26:45.684
Dude, you should
go up and defend yourself

26:45.685 --> 26:48.570
because your girl is throwing
you under the bus right now.

26:48.571 --> 26:50.339
But the meats were off.
On the counts.

26:50.340 --> 26:52.608
<i>If she knew she was going...</i>

26:52.609 --> 26:54.309
<i>But she didn't tell me.
She wasn't communicating.</i>

26:54.310 --> 26:55.744
Because when Kimmie
works the station

26:55.745 --> 26:56.391
she doesn't communicate.

26:56.392 --> 26:57.664
So you're throwing me
under the bus?

26:57.665 --> 26:59.653
<i>I'm not throwing you
under the bus.</i>

26:59.654 --> 27:03.018
Come on, tell me then.
Come on.

27:03.019 --> 27:04.787
Kimmie, you better
step the back.

27:04.788 --> 27:05.788
Bitch, I ain't
stepping nowhere!

27:05.789 --> 27:06.955
<i>You think I'm scared of you?</i>

27:06.956 --> 27:08.123
<i>I'm not scared of you.</i>

27:08.124 --> 27:09.291
<i>You're throwing me
under the bus.</i>

27:09.292 --> 27:10.993
Cool, bitch.
Cool.

27:10.994 --> 27:12.261
You called me
a bitch today,

27:12.262 --> 27:14.229
and you want me
to keep my mouth shut?

27:14.230 --> 27:15.364
It is so ghetto right now.

27:15.365 --> 27:16.532
Just shut up!

27:16.533 --> 27:18.600
<i>You talk to everyone</i>

27:18.601 --> 27:19.368
like they're
a piece of .

27:19.369 --> 27:20.281
No, I don't.
You are a piece of ,

27:20.282 --> 27:21.403
and you're
starting trouble,

27:21.404 --> 27:22.787
like I'm throwing you
underneath the bus?

27:22.788 --> 27:24.665
Started trouble?
Did you or did you not

27:24.666 --> 27:27.676
just say that her
two rib eye...

27:27.677 --> 27:29.111
I did.
Okay.

27:29.112 --> 27:30.012
I'm not lying.
That's not throwing...

27:30.013 --> 27:31.613
So she didn't lie to me.

27:31.614 --> 27:33.115
So you're throwing me
under the bus.

27:33.116 --> 27:34.183
It's cool, bitch.
Cool.

27:34.184 --> 27:35.551
It's true.
It's true.

27:35.552 --> 27:37.686
It's true what you do,
home slice, 'cause I know

27:37.687 --> 27:39.855
ain't none of my
damn steaks come back.

27:39.856 --> 27:41.924
<i>How many fish came back to you?</i>

27:41.925 --> 27:42.925
It's true.
My two fish came back

27:42.926 --> 27:43.992
because of you.

27:43.993 --> 27:46.094
You go yourself.
You!

27:46.095 --> 27:49.031
What's funny is that Kimmie
and Robyn used to be BFFs,

27:49.032 --> 27:53.669
and now all of a sudden,
they're arch rivals.

27:53.670 --> 27:56.004
<i>I'm so
done with you, dog.</i>

27:56.005 --> 27:57.539
I'm so done with you.

27:57.540 --> 27:59.808
Keep my friends close,
enemies closer.

27:59.809 --> 28:00.876
That's why I was keeping you
close to me, Kimmie.

28:02.378 --> 28:04.980
<i>There's no excuse for her
to have called me a bitch</i>

28:04.981 --> 28:05.547
when she was supposed to be
my friend.

28:05.548 --> 28:06.481
You just said

28:06.482 --> 28:08.283
you keep your enemies
closer, right?

28:08.284 --> 28:11.019
You just said
we ain't friends, right?

28:11.020 --> 28:13.055
forget you!
We ain't friends.

28:13.056 --> 28:14.356
you.
We ain't friends.

28:14.357 --> 28:15.390
You called me a bitch.

28:15.391 --> 28:16.992
you.
you.

28:16.993 --> 28:20.095
<i>Oh, Kimmie, suck .</i>

28:24.635 --> 28:27.537
It's two and a half hours
into dinner service...

28:27.538 --> 28:29.639
Get out!
off.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.675
And Royce and
Patrick from the blue team...

28:31.676 --> 28:33.009
Get out!

28:33.010 --> 28:34.744
And the entire red team

28:34.745 --> 28:36.313
have been kicked
out of the kitchen.

28:36.314 --> 28:37.948
And Robyn and Kimmie

28:37.949 --> 28:39.816
are having a little
difference of opinion.

28:39.817 --> 28:41.718
The meats were off
on the counts.

28:41.719 --> 28:43.553
<i>So you're throwing
me under the bus.</i>

28:43.554 --> 28:44.521
Cool, bitch.
Cool.

28:44.522 --> 28:46.356
None of my
damn steaks come back.

28:46.357 --> 28:48.658
<i>How many fish came back for you?
It's true.</i>

28:48.659 --> 28:50.026
My two fish came back
because of you.

28:50.027 --> 28:52.929
Whew, Kimmie and Robyn,
they've just been, um,

28:52.930 --> 28:54.965
you know, kind of going
at it all night.

28:54.966 --> 28:55.999
you.
We ain't friends.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.968
You called me a bitch.
you.

28:57.969 --> 28:59.102
The shouting
and the name-calling,

28:59.103 --> 29:01.438
all that... it's like
"dude, like shut up."

29:01.439 --> 29:03.907
<i>Oh, Kimmie,
suck .</i>

29:03.908 --> 29:08.311
While Robyn offers
Kimmie an interesting suggestion,

29:08.312 --> 29:09.946
back in the kitchen,

29:09.947 --> 29:11.648
it's up to Justin...
Get that first one up.

29:11.649 --> 29:13.483
Brian...
First noodle.

29:13.484 --> 29:15.218
And Clemenza...
Hanger steak coming out, chef.

29:15.219 --> 29:17.354
To complete dinner service
for both teams.

29:17.355 --> 29:18.788
Service, please.

29:18.789 --> 29:20.223
<i>This is really, really good.</i>

29:20.224 --> 29:21.691
Is it really good?
Yeah?

29:21.692 --> 29:23.293
Last table.
Concentrate, guys.

29:23.294 --> 29:25.362
Two meatballs, one rib eye,
one loup de mer.

29:25.363 --> 29:26.796
Yes, chef.

29:26.797 --> 29:28.665
Rib eye.
Yes, chef, coming up.

29:28.666 --> 29:31.234
<i>Got your sauce.
Okay, get it up.</i>

29:31.235 --> 29:33.870
I'm going with the rib eye.
You get that up, okay?

29:33.871 --> 29:35.005
Tonight was really tough,
but Justin's strong,

29:35.006 --> 29:37.374
Clemenza's strong, I'm strong.

29:37.375 --> 29:38.942
So I'm really not surprised
that we're the last three left.

29:38.943 --> 29:39.809
Let's go.

29:39.810 --> 29:42.212
Loup de mer in the window.
Pasta's going, right now.

29:42.213 --> 29:43.380
<i>Table ten, please.</i>

29:43.381 --> 29:44.781
This is so good

29:44.782 --> 29:46.049
that I want
to come back tomorrow.

29:46.050 --> 29:47.283
<i>Tomorrow?</i>

29:47.284 --> 29:51.588
<i>Stoves off. Let's go.
Shut it down.</i>

29:55.459 --> 29:56.860
Holy crap.

29:56.861 --> 29:58.862
<i>Let me just
get one thing clear.</i>

29:58.863 --> 30:01.564
Ridiculous.

30:01.565 --> 30:04.167
I started service tonight
with 11 chefs.

30:04.168 --> 30:06.069
I finished the service
with three.

30:06.070 --> 30:08.171
Thank you, Brian.
Yes, chef.

30:08.172 --> 30:09.539
<i>Justin, Clemenza.
Thank you.</i>

30:09.540 --> 30:10.306
Yes, chef.

30:10.307 --> 30:12.845
The winning team tonight...

30:14.745 --> 30:17.814
There's no such thing.

30:17.815 --> 30:19.983
There's more passion
in the valet parking

30:19.984 --> 30:22.018
<i>before our guests arrived</i>

30:22.019 --> 30:23.653
<i>than in this restaurant
tonight.</i>

30:23.654 --> 30:25.188
Embarrassing.

30:25.189 --> 30:27.357
<i>Red team, blue team.
Back upstairs.</i>

30:27.358 --> 30:30.260
<i>Come up with two nominees
to leave.</i>

30:32.730 --> 30:35.165
Piss off.

30:38.135 --> 30:40.670
I can't believe
that we didn't win.

30:40.671 --> 30:43.473
I mean, the entire red team
was kicked out of the kitchen,

30:43.474 --> 30:46.309
but we started with five,
we ended up with three.

30:46.310 --> 30:52.015
Based on tonight's service,
we have an easy decision.

30:54.452 --> 30:59.956
I'll go.
I got Royce and Patrick tonight.

30:59.957 --> 31:02.025
For obvious reasons.

31:02.026 --> 31:04.594
<i>I'd have to
say the same thing.</i>

31:04.595 --> 31:07.030
I didn't deserve
to get nominated.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.332
I had one thing come back.
But that's my team.

31:09.333 --> 31:12.168
It's not really much of a team.

31:12.169 --> 31:14.237
I really screwed the pooch

31:14.238 --> 31:16.106
on the callbacks, and then,
uh, the last rare steak

31:16.107 --> 31:17.874
that got me thrown out
of the kitchen.

31:17.875 --> 31:18.808
I mean, I get it guys.

31:18.809 --> 31:20.076
I screwed it up.

31:20.077 --> 31:21.845
I screwed it up for myself,

31:21.846 --> 31:23.279
I screwed it up
for my blue team,

31:23.280 --> 31:24.547
but I'm so much better
than this,

31:24.548 --> 31:26.349
and I know I have it in me.

31:26.350 --> 31:27.951
I'm going to come back strong
because I'm not a quitter.

31:27.952 --> 31:31.688
I'm a fighter.

31:31.689 --> 31:32.761
All right, guys.

31:32.762 --> 31:35.058
I think we need
to start talking about this.

31:35.059 --> 31:38.197
I'm going to...
I'm going to say Tiff.

31:38.198 --> 31:40.296
It was too much
with the screaming.

31:40.297 --> 31:43.199
<i>Can you shut up and
stop yelling at me?</i>

31:43.200 --> 31:45.168
<i>You want to talk, talk.
Do not yell!</i>

31:45.169 --> 31:47.737
My biggest reason
for nominating Tiffany

31:47.738 --> 31:50.006
was that fight
she got into with Barbie.

31:50.007 --> 31:52.675
Completely unprofessional
and unacceptable,

31:52.676 --> 31:54.544
especially on family night.

31:54.545 --> 31:56.279
<i>That was intense.</i>

31:56.280 --> 31:58.181
<i>I thought you guys
were going to fist fight</i>

31:58.182 --> 31:59.115
<i>over the deep fryer.</i>

31:59.116 --> 32:00.083
I'm just sick of,
like, yelling.

32:00.084 --> 32:00.984
And it, like, really
drives me up a wall.

32:00.985 --> 32:02.786
I was just trying
to be clear, like,

32:02.787 --> 32:04.621
<i>"please don't
put that down."</i>

32:04.622 --> 32:06.856
I can't handle that.

32:06.857 --> 32:09.159
Barbie is the weakest person
on this team,

32:09.160 --> 32:10.226
and I've just had it
with Barbie's attitude.

32:10.227 --> 32:11.528
We're here to cook food.

32:11.529 --> 32:12.896
We're not here
to give an attitude, like...

32:12.897 --> 32:14.397
Hmm.

32:14.398 --> 32:16.866
I'm gonna vote
for Robyn and Tiffany

32:16.867 --> 32:18.968
because Tiffany, um,
your pizzas came back.

32:18.969 --> 32:21.337
And that's what
was up on apps.

32:21.338 --> 32:22.839
And Robyn didn't have no
communication with me on fish,

32:22.840 --> 32:24.407
so...

32:24.408 --> 32:26.042
I'm not voting for myself.
One of my vote's for Kimmie.

32:26.043 --> 32:28.144
For mis-communicating.

32:28.145 --> 32:30.580
<i>Here she goes
with this .</i>

32:30.581 --> 32:32.348
She didn't communicate with me.
I was right across from her.

32:32.349 --> 32:34.517
<i>All she had to do
was look at me.</i>

32:34.518 --> 32:35.718
<i>Kimmie, you know what,
why don't you be a woman</i>

32:35.719 --> 32:36.886
<i>and admit to fault?</i>

32:36.887 --> 32:37.787
Because I didn't fault tonight.

32:37.788 --> 32:39.589
Really?
This is what you did, Kimmie.

32:39.590 --> 32:41.124
At least I admit to my faults.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.525
I didn't fault or I would
admit to this !

32:42.526 --> 32:44.460
You told me to run the fish.

32:44.461 --> 32:46.296
<i>That's what
my fish up the first time.</i>

32:46.297 --> 32:47.597
How many of my steaks
came back tonight?

32:47.598 --> 32:49.599
call was off.
Oh, no, my call wasn't.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.235
Your ears need to
be cleaned out, bitch.

32:52.236 --> 32:54.437
You better watch
who you're calling bitch.

32:54.438 --> 32:55.471
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

32:55.472 --> 32:57.207
<i>Kimmie!</i>

32:58.813 --> 33:01.482
With no dinner service winner,

33:01.483 --> 33:03.717
both teams have to nominate
two people for elimination.

33:03.718 --> 33:06.987
The men very calmly
picked Royce and Patrick,

33:06.988 --> 33:08.856
but the women's deliberation...

33:08.857 --> 33:10.324
How many of my steaks
came back tonight?

33:10.325 --> 33:13.761
Your call was off.
Is complete chaos.

33:13.762 --> 33:15.429
Your ears need to
be cleaned out, bitch.

33:15.430 --> 33:17.264
You better watch
who you're calling bitch.

33:17.265 --> 33:19.233
Get in my face.
I am in your face.

33:19.234 --> 33:20.734
I'm about to hit you.

33:20.735 --> 33:22.236
It is ugly.

33:22.237 --> 33:24.638
They're standing
this close together,

33:24.639 --> 33:27.007
and I'm just thinking, like,
who's gonna hit who first?

33:27.008 --> 33:29.910
Hit me, hit me.

33:29.911 --> 33:31.145
I ain't a
child like you.

33:31.146 --> 33:34.782
Hit me.

33:34.783 --> 33:37.217
Get the out of my face,
you stupid bitch.

33:37.218 --> 33:38.519
What are you gonna do?
hit me?

33:38.520 --> 33:40.220
Get the away from me.

33:40.221 --> 33:42.055
Don't even
get me ghetto, Kimmie.

33:42.056 --> 33:43.223
Stop. Stop.

33:43.224 --> 33:45.459
Tonight, I am just so over

33:45.460 --> 33:47.227
the shouting,
and the name-calling,

33:47.228 --> 33:48.429
and all that .

33:48.430 --> 33:50.364
Any conflict that's ever
happened on our team...

33:50.365 --> 33:52.433
somehow, Robyn has
her hand in it.

33:52.434 --> 33:55.502
So, yeah, I'm ready to have that
cancer cut out of our team.

33:55.503 --> 33:57.137
<i>The votes are in.
Deal with it.</i>

34:08.516 --> 34:09.483
Steak night...

34:09.484 --> 34:14.087
Disaster night.

34:14.088 --> 34:16.156
<i>I mean, really embarrassing.</i>

34:16.157 --> 34:17.891
<i>Clemenza,
first nominee and why.</i>

34:17.891 --> 34:23.496
Got to go with Patrick.

34:23.498 --> 34:27.967
I mean, at this point
in the game, it's inexcusable.

34:27.969 --> 34:29.703
Second nominee and why.

34:29.704 --> 34:31.505
Second nominee was Royce.

34:31.505 --> 34:33.574
<i>He got thrown out as well.</i>

34:33.574 --> 34:36.143
I mean it's just...
that mistake shouldn't be made.

34:36.143 --> 34:37.411
Red team...

34:37.411 --> 34:41.281
Kimmie, first nominee and why.

34:41.282 --> 34:43.083
Our first nominee, chef,
is Tiffany

34:43.083 --> 34:45.585
because of the appetizers.

34:45.587 --> 34:47.454
She got us off to a slow start.

34:47.455 --> 34:49.489
Second nominee and why.

34:49.491 --> 34:51.992
Our second
nominee, chef, was Robyn

34:51.993 --> 34:54.428
because she pretty much lied
to you and told you.

34:54.429 --> 34:56.730
That she cooked
the fish three minutes,

34:56.731 --> 35:00.367
and she cooked it
for seven, so...

35:00.368 --> 35:02.803
What?

35:02.804 --> 35:04.972
I didn't lie to you, chef,
when I said I took

35:04.973 --> 35:06.440
the fish out at three minutes.

35:06.441 --> 35:08.542
<i>The fish was cooked
seven minutes prior.</i>

35:08.543 --> 35:10.043
So... miscommunication
on what I said,

35:10.044 --> 35:11.144
but I did not lie to you.

35:11.145 --> 35:12.579
What?

35:12.580 --> 35:14.648
I know I've been true to
myself about not lying

35:14.649 --> 35:16.183
because that's the way
my mother raised me.

35:16.184 --> 35:17.451
Oh, my God.

35:17.452 --> 35:19.119
<i>Oh, my God, Kimmie.
Please.</i>

35:19.120 --> 35:23.290
I... You know what,
Kimmie?

35:23.291 --> 35:24.992
If you really want
to get dirty right now,

35:24.993 --> 35:27.427
we can get dirty.

35:27.428 --> 35:29.329
<i>You think I'm scared of you?</i>

35:29.330 --> 35:31.031
You called me
a bitch today,

35:31.032 --> 35:32.866
<i>and you want me
to keep my mouth shut?</i>

35:32.867 --> 35:34.234
Guess what?

35:34.235 --> 35:35.869
They're no friends
in this competition

35:35.870 --> 35:36.603
because I want to work for him.

35:36.604 --> 35:38.204
Wow.

35:41.776 --> 35:42.976
<i>Royce, Patrick...</i>

35:42.977 --> 35:44.278
<i>Tiffany, Robyn...</i>

35:44.279 --> 35:46.413
Step forward, please.

35:50.752 --> 35:54.187
Royce, I'm running
out of patience.

35:54.188 --> 35:55.756
Tell me why you think

35:55.757 --> 35:57.658
<i>you should stay
in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

35:57.659 --> 35:58.859
Chef, I've got
a lot of fight in me.

35:58.860 --> 36:00.627
I come through these doors
every day with a lot of fight.

36:00.628 --> 36:03.330
I've been kicked, beaten,
and stabbed.

36:03.331 --> 36:05.399
<i>And I keep coming
back for more.</i>

36:05.400 --> 36:07.668
And that's what
I'm gonna keep doing.

36:07.669 --> 36:09.436
I feel like I'm getting
better and better every day.

36:09.437 --> 36:11.171
And I feel
like I'm twice the man

36:11.172 --> 36:12.439
every day I come in here.

36:12.440 --> 36:15.142
I'm not feeling it.

36:15.143 --> 36:17.377
Patrick...
Yes, chef.

36:17.378 --> 36:19.446
<i>Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?</i>

36:19.447 --> 36:20.948
<i>I'm a professional chef.</i>

36:20.949 --> 36:22.783
I bring all my passion,
and commitment, and my drive.

36:22.784 --> 36:24.484
There's no doubt I have
some rust on me on the line.

36:24.485 --> 36:26.920
<i>I'm fighting through that.</i>

36:26.921 --> 36:28.722
<i>I have the heart for this.</i>

36:28.723 --> 36:30.657
I've worked my whole life
for this opportunity.

36:30.658 --> 36:31.825
What have you got left
I haven't seen?

36:31.826 --> 36:33.427
<i>I can... I can cook.</i>

36:33.428 --> 36:35.162
I can complete the service.

36:35.163 --> 36:35.529
I can command
that kitchen, chef.

36:35.530 --> 36:36.997
I can do it.

36:36.998 --> 36:39.132
Every time my back's turned,

36:39.133 --> 36:40.968
I panic because I know
you're not coming forward

36:40.969 --> 36:42.102
with the goods.

36:42.103 --> 36:44.571
Don't lose faith in me.

36:44.572 --> 36:46.707
I can do it.

36:46.708 --> 36:48.141
Tiffany.

36:48.142 --> 36:51.878
<i>Yes, chef.
Do you care?</i>

36:51.879 --> 36:53.747
Right now, I'm not done.

36:53.748 --> 36:55.582
It's just the cattiness
sometimes in our team

36:55.583 --> 36:57.784
just sucks,
you know what I mean?

36:57.785 --> 36:59.319
Barbie.
Yes, chef.

36:59.320 --> 37:01.421
<i>You've been shaking your head.</i>

37:01.422 --> 37:02.889
What the is going on
back there? Talk to me.

37:02.890 --> 37:05.258
I feel like Tiffany
doesn't care about standards.

37:05.259 --> 37:07.294
She doesn't care
about technique.

37:07.295 --> 37:08.996
She doesn't care about service.
Really?

37:08.997 --> 37:10.464
She doesn't care
about professionalism.

37:10.465 --> 37:11.698
Or she wouldn't have
stood up the pass

37:11.699 --> 37:12.966
and turn to curse at me.

37:12.967 --> 37:14.501
Barbie, you gave me attitude.

37:14.502 --> 37:16.503
For twice tonight,
you gave me attitude.

37:16.504 --> 37:18.472
You were, like, "uh-uh, I'm not
ready, don't bring those up."

37:18.473 --> 37:19.873
This is the cattiness
I'm talking about.

37:19.874 --> 37:21.141
I don't deal with that.

37:21.142 --> 37:22.376
If you want my opinion,

37:22.377 --> 37:24.878
I think that Barbie's the
weakest person in this kitchen

37:24.879 --> 37:25.579
because she can't run
a station by herself.

37:25.580 --> 37:28.382
Oh, hell no.
She's useless.

37:36.646 --> 37:39.048
After a disastrous steak night,

37:39.049 --> 37:41.884
the blue team has nominated
Patrick and Royce,

37:41.885 --> 37:44.620
and the red team has nominated
Robyn and Tiffany.

37:44.621 --> 37:46.588
But Tiffany has
another suggestion

37:46.589 --> 37:48.891
about who should be going home.

37:48.892 --> 37:50.259
I think that Barbie is the
weakest person in this kitchen

37:50.260 --> 37:53.329
because she can't
run a station by herself.

37:53.330 --> 37:54.963
<i>What?</i>

37:54.964 --> 37:56.832
I don't want to hear your
attitude or your eye-rolling

37:56.833 --> 37:58.400
or your crap, honestly.

37:58.401 --> 37:59.201
She doesn't care, chef.

37:59.202 --> 38:00.336
Do you care?

38:00.337 --> 38:01.737
I do care.

38:01.738 --> 38:05.474
How much,
on a scale of one to ten?

38:05.475 --> 38:09.211
<i>I care on a scale of
one to ten, like, a nine.</i>

38:13.216 --> 38:15.384
Robyn.
Yes, chef.

38:15.385 --> 38:17.953
<i>Why do you think you should stay
in Hell's Kitchen?</i>

38:17.954 --> 38:18.721
<i>I feel like I should
stay in Hell's Kitchen</i>

38:18.722 --> 38:20.189
because I have
more fight in me.

38:20.190 --> 38:21.623
<i>I have not given up.</i>

38:21.624 --> 38:23.125
I'm here,
but I want to be here.

38:23.126 --> 38:24.827
I do have standards,
but I drop off my standards

38:24.828 --> 38:26.595
sometimes because I'm
trying save someone's ass

38:26.596 --> 38:28.797
besides myself.

38:28.798 --> 38:30.366
<i>Whose ass are you saving?</i>

38:30.367 --> 38:31.767
Who is it?
Tell me.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.235
I sometimes feel
like I protect Kimmie.

38:33.236 --> 38:36.472
Is this true, Kimmie?

38:36.473 --> 38:38.674
Yes.
No. Not at all.

38:38.675 --> 38:40.709
Yes, it is true.
Why are you lying?

38:40.710 --> 38:42.478
<i>If you think
you're saving my ass,</i>

38:42.479 --> 38:44.213
you didn't save my ass
in the rib eye competition.

38:44.214 --> 38:46.348
Hey, I told you
to send me rib eye.

38:46.349 --> 38:48.384
Don't turn around, Christina
because I did.

38:48.385 --> 38:49.118
Really, are you... so now
you're in charge of me, too?

38:49.119 --> 38:50.252
I'm not even talking to you.

38:50.253 --> 38:52.421
Ah, go ahead, girl.
, talk.

38:52.422 --> 38:54.256
<i>This is the cattiness
that goes on, chef.</i>

38:54.257 --> 38:56.525
<i>This is why I hate
working on the red team.</i>

38:56.526 --> 38:57.292
I prefer
to be on the blue team.

38:57.293 --> 38:58.193
<i>They're gonna kick your ass.</i>

38:58.194 --> 38:59.995
No, they won't because
they respect me

38:59.996 --> 39:02.464
because I
come in here with 250%.

39:02.465 --> 39:06.969
Oh, my God.
This is insane.

39:06.970 --> 39:09.671
You ladies were riding high

39:09.672 --> 39:12.107
<i>success after success.</i>

39:12.108 --> 39:15.373
And look
at the state of you now.

39:17.870 --> 39:19.137
Okay.

39:21.919 --> 39:23.919
My decision is...

39:27.824 --> 39:31.326
Tiffany and Royce.

39:31.327 --> 39:33.295
Back in line.

39:37.534 --> 39:40.035
I care. I care.
Come on, come on.

39:40.036 --> 39:42.638
<i>Just shut up.
That's it, just stop.</i>

39:42.639 --> 39:44.411
<i>The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen...</i>

39:47.477 --> 39:49.812
Patrick.

39:49.813 --> 39:51.413
Give me your jacket.

39:51.414 --> 39:55.451
<i>Your time is done
in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

39:55.452 --> 39:56.318
Wow.

39:56.319 --> 40:00.923
It's not happening.

40:00.924 --> 40:02.825
And if it is,
it's not fast enough.

40:02.826 --> 40:04.226
Thank you, chef.
Thank you.

40:04.227 --> 40:05.461
Good night.

40:11.401 --> 40:13.769
I know I had higher expectations
going into this.

40:13.770 --> 40:17.673
My family's going
to be disappointed

40:17.674 --> 40:19.641
and a little sad for me,

40:19.642 --> 40:21.643
but an opportunity comes along,

40:21.644 --> 40:23.011
and you got to grab onto it
and try.

40:23.012 --> 40:25.214
It'll be great to go home,
though,

40:25.215 --> 40:28.817
and see my wife and kids,
I'll tell you that.

40:28.818 --> 40:31.153
<i>Let me tell you something.</i>

40:31.154 --> 40:35.224
Based on tonight's performance,
I'm not done yet.

40:35.225 --> 40:40.762
Not on the back
of a service like that.

40:40.763 --> 40:43.398
Robyn.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.533
Give me your jacket.

40:44.534 --> 40:45.534
Yes, chef.

40:45.535 --> 40:50.772
You are leaving...

40:50.773 --> 40:52.941
The red team...
you're joining the blue team.

40:52.942 --> 40:58.413
<i>Let's see how you perform now.</i>

40:58.414 --> 41:01.316
<i>And if you complain
about the blue team</i>

41:01.317 --> 41:03.752
<i>the way you did
about the red team,</i>

41:03.753 --> 41:04.686
I'm going to be looking at you
and you only.

41:04.687 --> 41:05.721
Yes, chef.

41:05.722 --> 41:07.422
Good night.

41:07.423 --> 41:09.391
Good night, chef.

41:09.392 --> 41:10.859
Yes!

41:10.860 --> 41:13.061
Good luck to the blue team.
Have fun with her.

41:13.062 --> 41:15.564
You're not going to like her,
but you have fun.

41:15.565 --> 41:17.599
Robyn's coming
over with some hate

41:17.600 --> 41:20.335
for the red team, and she's
got something to prove.

41:20.336 --> 41:22.371
Hopefully, we can turn this
into some positive energy

41:22.372 --> 41:24.273
and make that work
for the blue team.

41:24.274 --> 41:26.508
I came here to be the best.

41:26.509 --> 41:28.277
And working on the red team,

41:28.278 --> 41:30.212
they've only brought out
my worst.

41:30.213 --> 41:31.780
And now the
is going to be dropped

41:31.781 --> 41:33.348
because I work better
with men.

41:33.349 --> 41:35.183
Patrick talked a good game,

41:35.184 --> 41:37.252
but he couldn't back it up
with his cooking.

41:37.253 --> 41:39.421
<i>So it's time for him
to leave Hell's Kitchen.</i>
