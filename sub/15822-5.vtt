WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:05.153
Angie, how else can I say it?
I don't want lunch.

00:05.221 --> 00:08.156
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

00:10.860 --> 00:14.523
Come on. Did anyone ever tell you
you're a big old grouch?

00:14.898 --> 00:16.593
You're the first.

00:19.469 --> 00:21.994
At least you're a big old sexy grouch.

00:23.673 --> 00:26.335
Come on. Please?
They have pancakes here.

00:26.409 --> 00:27.569
Angie!

00:28.178 --> 00:32.444
I just killed your husband an hour ago.
I don't want pancakes.

00:33.016 --> 00:34.574
So what?

00:34.684 --> 00:38.211
Come on. You're gonna go on the run
on an empty stomach?

00:38.988 --> 00:41.115
Look, I own half a car dealership now.

00:41.191 --> 00:42.920
<i>I'm rich. I'll buy.</i>

00:43.026 --> 00:44.288
Buzz, are we getting all this?

00:44.360 --> 00:47.591
Well, if you're asking if I can do anything
about this truck noise in the background,

00:47.664 --> 00:50.030
- I'm not a magician.
- It's not going in a festival.

00:50.100 --> 00:52.660
I was just asking
if we were recording or not.

00:52.736 --> 00:53.930
<i>Really?</i>

00:56.840 --> 00:59.809
I can't decide what's more
nauseating.

00:59.876 --> 01:04.040
Her trying to kill her husband
or watching her come on to Provenza.

01:05.114 --> 01:06.104
<i>Well...</i>

01:06.616 --> 01:09.244
Chief. We have guns. We can stop this.

01:09.986 --> 01:12.045
And then we just wait
for proof that he's dead.

01:12.122 --> 01:14.556
Proof? Proof?

01:14.624 --> 01:16.751
Here's his wallet. The proof we agreed on.

01:16.826 --> 01:19.124
Now, here. You take the wallet.

01:19.729 --> 01:21.924
Now, you give me the $20,000.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.769
No. No, I'll give you the money
when the cops call me

01:26.836 --> 01:28.326
and say that they found the body.

01:28.404 --> 01:31.134
- Lieutenant Flynn.
- Already on it, Chief.

01:37.981 --> 01:39.608
- Hello?
<i>- Yes. Hello.</i>

01:39.682 --> 01:41.547
Is this Ms. Anush Serabian?

01:41.618 --> 01:43.677
It's Angie Serabian. Yeah.

01:43.753 --> 01:47.052
Yes, this is Lieutenant Flynn of the LAPD.

01:47.157 --> 01:48.181
Oh.

01:48.258 --> 01:51.853
- It's a cop.
- Don't say where you are.

01:53.463 --> 01:55.727
- Hi.
<i>- Hi. Are you sitting down, ma 'am?</i>

01:55.799 --> 02:00.634
No, no. Actually, I'm standing,
in a parking lot in Bakersfield.

02:02.105 --> 02:07.941
Listen, I'm sorry to have to tell you
this, but your husband was shot

02:08.011 --> 02:10.104
<i>in an apparent robbery, and he's dead.</i>

02:11.281 --> 02:12.646
Oh, no!

02:14.384 --> 02:17.581
Oh, my God!
I don't believe it!

02:20.290 --> 02:21.655
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

02:24.160 --> 02:27.687
- Now, give me the money.
- All right. Don't be so pushy.

02:31.968 --> 02:34.732
Now, that's what I'm talking about, Angie.

02:34.804 --> 02:36.533
Money is exchanged.

02:37.373 --> 02:40.171
- And so ends another Provenza date.
- Hmm.

02:40.443 --> 02:43.935
George, you're really gonna call me, right?

02:44.280 --> 02:47.215
Angie, baby. I promise.

02:47.283 --> 02:48.375
Mmm.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.985
You have not seen the last of me.

02:56.292 --> 02:57.589
Mmm.

02:59.195 --> 03:00.992
Oh, George, cut it out.

03:01.064 --> 03:04.830
Angie Serabian, you're under arrest for
the attempted murder of Alex Serabian.

03:04.901 --> 03:06.732
- Hands on the car.
- What are you talking about?

03:06.803 --> 03:08.361
You have the right
to remain silent.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.406
If you refuse to remain silent,
anything you say

03:10.473 --> 03:11.906
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

03:11.975 --> 03:14.068
Get your hands off me! Stop it!

03:14.143 --> 03:17.044
Ms. Serabian, I'm Deputy Chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson of the LAPD.

03:17.113 --> 03:20.605
Let me tell you something. I'm not here
to kill anyone. I'm here on a date.

03:20.683 --> 03:22.583
You tell them, George!

03:24.254 --> 03:26.722
Thank you. Thank you.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.518
Hold the applause. I'm here all week.

03:31.261 --> 03:32.785
You lied to me!

03:34.063 --> 03:37.555
He didn't tell me he was lying,
so you can't arrest me.

03:38.902 --> 03:42.269
Ms. Serabian, sign this waiver,
or I'll be forced to leave you in Bakersfield,

03:42.338 --> 03:44.704
and it'll be at least a week
until you're arraigned in LA.

03:44.774 --> 03:46.605
- I'm not signing anything.
- Angie.

03:46.676 --> 03:49.008
- No!
- Sign the waiver, sweetie pie.

03:49.078 --> 03:51.546
And I tell you what.
We'll drive back together,

03:51.614 --> 03:54.674
and I'll even throw in a nice,
romantic lunch.

03:59.289 --> 04:01.348
You sure it's not gonna be
too hot in there?

04:01.424 --> 04:04.587
And what? Melt the videotape? No. Here.

04:04.661 --> 04:08.222
- Hey, this is not your property!
- Hey, I need the wallet.

04:08.298 --> 04:09.322
Here we go.

04:09.399 --> 04:11.697
Oh, please.
Not with that stupid thing again.

04:11.768 --> 04:15.329
Listen, all my evidence is in here,
and I'm taking no chances.

04:15.405 --> 04:16.497
Come on, let's go.

04:16.572 --> 04:17.800
You know what I can tell
about you?

04:17.874 --> 04:19.398
- What?
- You hate women.

04:19.475 --> 04:20.668
No. Just you.

04:20.976 --> 04:23.309
- Come on.
- You're pinching my arm again.

04:23.379 --> 04:25.677
- Here we go.
<i>- No sea una</i> bitch!

04:26.015 --> 04:27.812
Who are you calling a bitch for?

04:31.187 --> 04:32.245
Are you?

04:32.322 --> 04:34.290
Rosie, you been riding us all day, girl.
Chill out.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.086
And now you're taking his side?
Whatever, man.

04:36.159 --> 04:39.526
Yeah, I'm gonna take his side, <i>perra.</i>
Get used to it.

04:46.002 --> 04:49.438
I'm not even hungry anymore.
And I can't believe you lied to me, George.

04:49.505 --> 04:52.235
George didn't lie to you, Angie. I did.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.942
- And my name isn't George.
- Well, what is it, then?

04:55.011 --> 04:56.376
Lieutenant.

04:56.679 --> 04:59.944
You know, you need to quit laughing
and judging me.

05:00.283 --> 05:03.377
- I was in a really bad marriage.
- Hey, listen, sweetie.

05:03.453 --> 05:06.445
Between us, we've been stuck
in six bad marriages.

05:06.522 --> 05:08.820
We just didn't choose
to murder our way out.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.086
Though I understand the urge.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.822
I bet your wife
never cut up your credit cards

05:13.896 --> 05:16.592
or made you feel like a cheap prostitute.

05:16.666 --> 05:19.999
Or made you dance naked
in front of your AA friends.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.196
Your husband let you have credit cards?

05:25.308 --> 05:27.538
What's gonna happen to me, George?

05:27.643 --> 05:29.804
Oh, Angie, it's not gonna be that bad.

05:29.879 --> 05:32.245
You'll be off to Parker Center.
You'll like that.

05:32.315 --> 05:35.307
They're gonna take your picture,
they're gonna fingerprint you,

05:35.385 --> 05:39.014
and they're gonna book you.
I mean, who knows?

05:39.255 --> 05:40.381
Be a gas.

05:40.456 --> 05:43.892
Um...
What's gonna happen to me after that?

05:43.960 --> 05:48.294
And then we give the surveillance tape
and the 20 grand over to the DA.

05:54.837 --> 05:57.931
Do you really think you have
enough evidence to put me in jail?

05:58.007 --> 06:00.168
Are you serious?

06:00.243 --> 06:03.804
Once the jury sees the evidence
that we have in that car,

06:03.880 --> 06:06.212
you're out of here. Am I right?

06:09.352 --> 06:11.786
- Now what did you lose?
- Cell phone.

06:12.321 --> 06:14.118
I left it in the car.

06:14.624 --> 06:18.287
You know, you should be really worried
about your friend George.

06:18.361 --> 06:21.762
I mean, I had to tell him three times
where to find my husband.

06:21.831 --> 06:25.392
Don't worry about him.
That guy's at the top of his game.

06:30.173 --> 06:32.334
Look, you got to order
something off the menu,

06:32.408 --> 06:37.243
because starting tomorrow, it's gonna be
nothing but powdered eggs and burritos.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:53.629 --> 06:56.189
Do you think all the evidence
was in the car?

06:56.265 --> 06:57.892
Every bit of it.

07:07.877 --> 07:09.242
Oh, my God.

07:10.413 --> 07:12.608
Maybe I should call the cops.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.647
The real cops, right?

07:17.053 --> 07:21.649
Oh, too bad for you, and great for me!

07:27.797 --> 07:30.231
Am I sorry that we ruined
your afternoon off?

07:30.299 --> 07:31.664
You betcha.

07:31.934 --> 07:34.368
But, Chief, if I tried,

07:34.437 --> 07:37.634
I mean, I couldn't count the number
of things that went right today.

07:38.074 --> 07:41.942
Start with the things that didn't,
like how you lost the evidence we need

07:42.011 --> 07:44.571
to prosecute an open-and-shut case
of attempted murder!

07:44.647 --> 07:48.777
Brenda, the evidence isn't lost.
It's just out for a joyride.

07:49.852 --> 07:52.252
I don't need sarcasm. I need the evidence.

07:52.321 --> 07:55.415
Don't look at me, the FBI stopped
manufacturing evidence in the late '90s.

07:56.859 --> 08:01.353
Chief, have we suffered a setback?
Unquestionably.

08:01.430 --> 08:02.829
But even if, God forbid,

08:02.899 --> 08:06.391
even if we never find
the video or the money

08:07.103 --> 08:08.502
or my car,

08:09.505 --> 08:11.803
Angie Serabian can still be prosecuted.

08:11.874 --> 08:13.239
He's right.

08:13.476 --> 08:16.309
With a little finesse, Angie could confess.

08:18.915 --> 08:23.352
You must have a little more faith than I do
in the Lieutenant's charisma.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.782
How could you do this to me?

08:27.323 --> 08:29.291
- I don't know what...
- How could you do this to me?

08:29.358 --> 08:31.758
For 25 years, I give you everything.

08:31.827 --> 08:34.727
A house, a car, new tits.

08:34.797 --> 08:36.525
And this is how you pay me back?

08:36.599 --> 08:37.725
- You bitch!
- You're a...

08:39.068 --> 08:40.967
Commander, what is going on here?

08:41.037 --> 08:45.770
Mr. Serabian wanted to retrieve his wallet
and meet the arresting detectives.

08:45.841 --> 08:50.039
Up till now, I had no idea
about this afternoon's complications.

08:50.112 --> 08:52.103
Is that my shirt?

08:53.616 --> 08:56.449
You give him my lucky dice shirt?

08:58.221 --> 09:00.519
Do you see the mother you have?

09:00.890 --> 09:04.451
Commander, please remove
Mr. Serabian and his family this instant!

09:04.527 --> 09:06.893
Wait! You, in my shirt.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.796
How much money
did she give you to kill me?

09:10.366 --> 09:11.628
$20,000.

09:12.902 --> 09:16.303
Where did you get that kind of money,
except by stealing it from me?

09:16.372 --> 09:19.500
Oh, my God. I don't know
anything about any money or...

09:19.575 --> 09:21.440
Or any attempted murder, either.

09:21.510 --> 09:23.637
Ms. Serabian, my entire squad saw you

09:23.713 --> 09:26.045
give Lieutenant Provenza here
an envelope of cash

09:26.115 --> 09:27.810
because you thought
he murdered your husband.

09:27.883 --> 09:29.441
And as soon as I know
where you got that money,

09:29.518 --> 09:32.351
I'm gonna be halfway to convicting you.

09:32.421 --> 09:33.581
Ms. Chief,

09:33.656 --> 09:38.218
perhaps if you could give my brother
his wallet, we could all go home now?

09:42.198 --> 09:44.996
Uh, yeah. Look, Mr. Serabian,

09:45.067 --> 09:47.262
we want to thank you
for giving us your wallet

09:47.336 --> 09:49.930
to assist in the arrest of your wife.

09:50.406 --> 09:54.365
Unfortunately, it was stolen,
along with all the other evidence,

09:54.443 --> 09:58.777
so you might want to cancel
your credit cards and things, and...

09:58.848 --> 10:01.840
- Oh, God.
- How inept are you people?

10:01.917 --> 10:04.078
You wouldn't believe this bunch.

10:04.153 --> 10:06.018
Chief Johnson, a word.

10:06.422 --> 10:07.514
Stay.

10:08.791 --> 10:11.988
- Where did you get the money?
- I entered your picture in an ugly contest,

10:12.061 --> 10:13.722
and you won the grand prize.

10:13.796 --> 10:17.425
Since you cannot hold her
more than 48 hours after booking,

10:17.500 --> 10:19.661
you might want to consider
releasing her now

10:19.735 --> 10:21.202
and then bringing her back in

10:21.270 --> 10:24.296
when you have a chance
to locate the missing evidence.

10:28.077 --> 10:31.410
Detective Sanchez, please take
Ms. Serabian here to processing,

10:31.480 --> 10:33.607
and let me know
when she's ready to be released.

10:33.683 --> 10:35.913
And, Mr. Serabian,
you are staying right here.

10:38.621 --> 10:40.486
Ha-ha. I get to go home.

10:43.659 --> 10:45.126
Bye, Georgie.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.030
So, that's it?

10:49.098 --> 10:52.693
No, that's not it.
She'll probably try to kill you again.

11:00.176 --> 11:02.440
The operation was
entirely successful.

11:02.511 --> 11:04.308
Murder was prevented.

11:06.415 --> 11:07.746
However,

11:07.817 --> 11:10.911
in the aftermath,
there was a small complication.

11:10.986 --> 11:12.180
Mmm-hmm.

11:12.955 --> 11:15.423
While buying food for the suspect,

11:15.825 --> 11:17.952
Lieutenant Provenza's car,

11:19.028 --> 11:21.462
with all the evidence, was stolen.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.803
You're kidding, right?

11:33.409 --> 11:36.845
And because I believe that
Ms. Serabian remains capable

11:36.912 --> 11:39.938
of carrying out her murder-for-hire plans,
we need to protect the husband

11:40.015 --> 11:43.314
while searching for
Lieutenant Provenza's car.

11:43.386 --> 11:46.116
You do realize that the longer
the evidence is out there,

11:46.188 --> 11:49.749
the nearer to impossible
it will be to admit it at trial?

11:52.495 --> 11:56.454
Just do what you have to do.
I'll sign off on whatever you need.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.426
- You will?
- Yes, with this understanding,

12:02.505 --> 12:05.565
if this situation is not completely resolved
within 48 hours,

12:05.641 --> 12:08.371
I will expect Provenza's resignation
from your division.

12:08.444 --> 12:10.105
That is completely arbitrary!

12:10.179 --> 12:12.613
Lieutenant Provenza is
an invaluable second-in-command!

12:12.681 --> 12:16.082
Who gets paid more than anyone else
in PHD, except for yourself.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.086
Can you honestly tell me
that he's worth it?

12:18.154 --> 12:20.748
- Absolutely.
- Or is it possible

12:20.823 --> 12:22.814
that your misguided attachment to him

12:22.892 --> 12:25.884
is based on your fondness for him
as a person?

12:27.863 --> 12:30.161
Excuse me. The clock's ticking.

12:33.035 --> 12:34.434
Why am I still here?

12:34.503 --> 12:38.098
For the umpteenth time,
it's for your protection.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.074
From my nutjob wife?

12:40.242 --> 12:44.975
A woman dumb enough
to hire a cop to kill me?

12:45.047 --> 12:47.515
Look, as soon as we get
the okay from the Chief,

12:47.583 --> 12:49.915
we're all gonna move to a motel.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.419
And spend the night with you two idiots?

12:52.488 --> 12:53.955
No, thanks.

12:54.023 --> 12:57.083
I have my own gun,
and I know how to use it.

12:59.795 --> 13:02.923
Flynn. No, no, no.
Flynn, if he wants to go, let him go.

13:02.998 --> 13:07.196
He's driving me crazy. And, I mean,
we can't hold him here, anyway.

13:07.269 --> 13:08.600
Thank you.

13:10.506 --> 13:12.940
And the $20,000 that you lost,

13:13.542 --> 13:16.409
if it came from me, you're paying it back!

13:16.679 --> 13:18.806
I'll send you a claim form.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.811
And I want my shirt.

13:47.276 --> 13:49.301
You let him walk out of here,
just like that?

13:49.378 --> 13:51.539
Chief, he complained for an hour.

13:51.614 --> 13:53.514
We couldn't lock him up.

13:55.651 --> 13:57.312
Where's Ms. Serabian right now?

13:57.386 --> 13:59.354
Almost through processing, Chief.

13:59.421 --> 14:02.015
With the husband out,
do you want us to hold her?

14:02.091 --> 14:04.924
No. Sergeant Gabriel and I will follow her.

14:05.060 --> 14:06.254
Thank you.

14:06.328 --> 14:10.196
Have we found the young man
who stole Lieutenant Provenza's car?

14:10.266 --> 14:14.202
No. But we did find his girlfriend,

14:14.270 --> 14:15.737
who paid by check at the pancake house.

14:15.804 --> 14:18.602
Ms. Lucy Santacruz,
lives at 84th and McKinley.

14:18.674 --> 14:20.574
Stakeout in progress.

14:20.910 --> 14:24.038
Detective Sanchez, would you please
press Ms. Santacruz a little?

14:24.113 --> 14:26.547
Maybe we could hurry things along.
Thank you.

14:26.615 --> 14:29.675
Chief, instead of Sanchez,
maybe I should be looking for my car

14:29.752 --> 14:32.778
and then kick the asses
of those punks who stole it!

14:32.855 --> 14:34.914
As much as I'd like to see you
break your own record

14:34.990 --> 14:37.686
for procedural violations in a single shift,

14:37.760 --> 14:39.990
I'd prefer if you and Lieutenant Flynn

14:40.062 --> 14:43.327
found Mr. Serabian
and kept him under surveillance.

14:44.066 --> 14:46.660
Do I need to explain how that's done?

14:54.143 --> 14:56.839
With our luck,
she's probably calling in another hit.

14:56.912 --> 14:58.436
I don't know.

14:58.514 --> 15:02.245
I don't have the slightest idea
how this woman's mind works.

15:03.385 --> 15:06.582
What I wouldn't give
to see the egg she hatched from.

15:17.366 --> 15:21.462
Kid said his father went for a sandwich
on the way to his office.

15:21.770 --> 15:26.434
Apparently, Dad didn't want
to be home when Mom got back.

15:26.508 --> 15:29.909
- Angie still lives here?
- Yeah, in the guest cottage.

15:29.979 --> 15:32.504
The asshole lives in the main house.

15:33.749 --> 15:37.048
Must make for some happy reunions
in the driveway.

16:08.484 --> 16:11.476
- You want some?
- No, thanks. I just ate.

16:11.553 --> 16:15.114
So, can't we prosecute Angie
without the tape?

16:15.190 --> 16:18.250
I mean, I don't understand.
We all heard what she said.

16:18.327 --> 16:21.319
I think a jury would believe
the attempted-murder part,

16:21.397 --> 16:24.594
but now that Lieutenant Provenza
lost the cash that Angie gave us,

16:24.667 --> 16:27.636
the murder-for-hire part
goes out the window.

16:27.703 --> 16:30.001
And maybe I should
just toss him out after it.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.370
Get rid of Lieutenant Provenza?

16:36.845 --> 16:38.244
You serious?

16:38.914 --> 16:40.882
I wish I were, Sergeant.

16:41.216 --> 16:44.014
It would make life a whole lot easier.

16:49.992 --> 16:51.425
Here we go.

17:18.820 --> 17:21.790
She left her car in Bakersfield.
What do you think she's doing here?

17:21.857 --> 17:25.656
Picking up a set of keys
to a loaner or something?

17:29.898 --> 17:31.729
Lieutenant, are you following us?

17:31.800 --> 17:34.268
We're looking for Alex Serabian,
just like you asked.

17:34.336 --> 17:36.236
His son said he was on his way here.

17:36.305 --> 17:41.368
"A-L-E-X-J-A-G." That's his car.

17:41.443 --> 17:43.138
- Alex Serabian is here?
- Yeah.

17:43.212 --> 17:45.305
Oh, for heaven's sakes!

17:47.516 --> 17:50.974
- Help me!
- Angie! Angie! Angie!

17:52.154 --> 17:55.214
- Someone shot my husband!
- Angie! Angie!

17:55.290 --> 17:58.919
Help me! Oh, my God! Help me! Help me!

17:58.994 --> 18:02.327
- What? What's going on?
- Help me! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

18:02.831 --> 18:05.391
I'm... I'm rich! I'm rich!

18:05.501 --> 18:09.631
Oh, my God, I'm rich!

18:23.318 --> 18:24.546
Oh, no.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.300
Okay.

18:45.474 --> 18:47.567
Now we have to get serious.

18:57.119 --> 18:58.450
Morning.

18:58.520 --> 19:01.580
Any news on Lieutenant Provenza's car?

19:01.657 --> 19:05.184
The girl from the pancake house
gave up her boyfriend/car thief,

19:05.260 --> 19:08.559
and Sanchez is staking out
the dirtbag's apartment right now.

19:08.630 --> 19:10.621
Okay. And what did we hear
from the medical examiner?

19:10.699 --> 19:13.668
The bullet that killed Alex Serabian
was a.32-caliber.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.100
Went straight through his heart.

19:15.170 --> 19:17.661
TOD was estimated around 8:45.

19:17.739 --> 19:20.401
Roughly 15 minutes
before you arrived on the scene.

19:20.475 --> 19:23.035
Oh, for heaven's sakes. 15 minutes?

19:28.884 --> 19:32.581
Add that to the fact that we saw
Angie Serabian walk in and out

19:32.654 --> 19:36.351
and didn't hear a gunshot and she tested
negative for gunshot residue.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.553
So it's virtually impossible
that she murdered her husband herself.

19:39.628 --> 19:41.459
Search of the premises
turned up a wall safe,

19:41.530 --> 19:43.430
which the victim's brother opened for us.

19:43.498 --> 19:47.093
We found Alex Serabian's passport,
a small amount of cash.

19:47.169 --> 19:49.501
No sign of a murder weapon,

19:49.571 --> 19:54.201
but the gun Serabian had registered to
him was a.32-caliber Walther.

19:54.476 --> 19:56.205
Same caliber as the one that shot him.

19:56.278 --> 19:59.042
So it's possible that Mr. Serabian's gun
was used against him.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.207
Any leads on where
Ms. Serabian got her money?

20:01.283 --> 20:04.480
Nothing, but SID found
a considerable amount of cash

20:04.553 --> 20:06.748
in a desk drawer in Alex Serabian's office.

20:06.822 --> 20:09.882
- Want to guess how much?
- $20,000 seems to be the magic number.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.084
To the dollar.

20:11.159 --> 20:14.856
All right, I want to know if
Ms. Serabian hired anyone else

20:14.930 --> 20:16.795
to murder her husband.

20:17.065 --> 20:20.159
Lieutenant Provenza,
did she mention anyone else to you?

20:20.235 --> 20:21.964
- Nope.
- No.

20:23.238 --> 20:25.035
Okay. Where is Ms. Serabian now?

20:25.107 --> 20:27.632
She's in Interview 2,
gabbing on her cell phone.

20:27.709 --> 20:29.438
I Mirandized her and figured it was okay

20:29.511 --> 20:32.002
for her to keep talking
while Buzz recorded her.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.377
Thank you.

20:33.448 --> 20:35.109
Morning, everyone.

20:35.918 --> 20:37.579
How are we doing
with our attempted murder?

20:37.653 --> 20:40.383
Very well. Very well. Case closed.

20:41.189 --> 20:44.158
Excellent.
And has the husband been notified?

20:44.226 --> 20:45.693
More or less.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.361
Oh, my God.

20:52.301 --> 20:53.928
With me. With me.

20:57.172 --> 20:58.230
Well?

20:58.307 --> 21:01.640
Well, we picked up one of the guys
who stole your car, but he's not talking.

21:01.710 --> 21:03.405
- Where is he?
- Interview 1, sir.

21:03.478 --> 21:05.207
Thank you, Sanchez.

21:19.594 --> 21:21.061
Even if the evidence is never recovered,

21:21.129 --> 21:23.154
we still have witness statements
from our officers.

21:23.231 --> 21:25.199
Yeah, and there's nothing
more persuasive to a jury

21:25.267 --> 21:29.863
than the statements of the officers
who botched the case in the first place.

21:37.746 --> 21:39.475
- What was that about?
- What was what about?

21:39.548 --> 21:42.210
He just walked out of here
with a picture of your mother.

21:42.284 --> 21:44.582
He's awfully fond of my mother.

21:46.321 --> 21:47.754
Hey, idiot.

21:48.256 --> 21:49.780
Do you know me?

21:51.393 --> 21:53.327
I said, "Do you know me?"

21:53.395 --> 21:55.795
No, man. I never seen you before.

21:55.864 --> 21:57.331
<i>Well, then.</i>

21:57.399 --> 22:00.266
- Do you know who this is?
- Your daughter?

22:04.006 --> 22:05.030
No.

22:05.907 --> 22:09.536
No. This is the sweet little old lady

22:09.611 --> 22:12.876
that you brutally murdered
and cut into tiny pieces.

22:12.948 --> 22:14.575
Whoa! What are you talking about?

22:14.649 --> 22:16.480
You stole her car.
You must be the one that killed her.

22:16.551 --> 22:18.382
I didn't kill no old lady, man.
That car was just sitting...

22:18.453 --> 22:21.945
So, you admit it.
You admit it. You stole the Civic.

22:22.024 --> 22:23.389
Bitches left us
in the middle of nowhere, man.

22:23.458 --> 22:27.224
We needed to get home, but
I didn't kill nobody. Where we going?

22:27.295 --> 22:29.195
If you don't want to be under arrest
for first degree murder,

22:29.264 --> 22:32.563
you're gonna take me to that car,
and you better hope there's no blood in it,

22:32.634 --> 22:34.363
you little pissant!

22:42.210 --> 22:44.644
He is going to be the death of me!

22:47.749 --> 22:50.547
Yeah. I know, Marie.
It's just terrible. I know.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.747
Yeah, it was all my fault. Yeah.

22:55.924 --> 22:59.485
Because it was my idea
to get the white couch.

22:59.895 --> 23:02.557
Yeah, I know. It picks up everything.

23:03.398 --> 23:06.663
Yeah. Marie, I gotta go.

23:07.069 --> 23:08.934
Yeah. It's the police.

23:10.172 --> 23:12.436
No. They're totally clueless.

23:13.909 --> 23:15.638
All right. Bye-bye.

23:18.046 --> 23:21.709
Can we get you anything, Ms. Serabian?
Something to drink?

23:22.250 --> 23:24.548
Well, champagne might be nice.

23:24.719 --> 23:26.778
I think the celebration
is a little premature,

23:26.855 --> 23:29.016
considering that you were
the last person with your husband

23:29.091 --> 23:30.854
before he was discovered dead.

23:30.926 --> 23:33.224
You followed me the whole time.

23:33.295 --> 23:36.594
Explain how I killed Alex
with you guys watching me.

23:37.399 --> 23:41.961
I just thank God you're the worst
police department in the whole world.

23:43.171 --> 23:45.002
Ma'am, we will eventually prove

23:45.073 --> 23:46.973
that you paid someone
to murder your husband.

23:47.042 --> 23:49.840
If I really wanted to get
someone to kill Alex, right,

23:49.911 --> 23:52.243
do you think I would ask George?

23:53.548 --> 23:54.913
I can't say.

23:54.983 --> 23:58.544
But have no fear,
we are aggressively looking into that.

23:58.620 --> 24:01.111
Well, you really need to speed things up,

24:01.189 --> 24:03.248
'cause I got a big funeral to plan.

24:03.325 --> 24:05.725
And I'm gonna go to Canyon Ranch.

24:06.761 --> 24:08.786
Last time you left here,
things didn't go so well,

24:08.864 --> 24:11.355
so you will not be leaving here
again anytime soon.

24:11.433 --> 24:13.094
All right, well, fine.

24:13.168 --> 24:16.399
But I really need somewhere
to plug in my charger, then.

24:17.372 --> 24:20.000
Sorry. We're gonna be needing this.

24:23.478 --> 24:26.311
See? Just like inside the car, no blood.

24:28.683 --> 24:30.173
Where's the money
that was in that envelope?

24:30.252 --> 24:31.776
- Gas and beer.
- Gas and beer?

24:31.853 --> 24:34.048
You didn't spend 20 grand
on gas and beer.

24:34.122 --> 24:35.919
What 20 grand?
It was only a few hundred in real money.

24:35.991 --> 24:39.017
- The rest was fake. Check it out.
- Look at this! Serabian cash.

24:39.094 --> 24:41.494
Little creep just might be
telling the truth.

24:41.563 --> 24:45.021
- These are photocopied. Look.
- I can't believe it! She ripped me off!

24:45.100 --> 24:47.295
Who can you trust these days?

24:47.602 --> 24:51.163
Wait, wait, wait. Flynn! Wait.

24:54.809 --> 24:58.245
Thank God Almighty!
We're back in business!

25:00.515 --> 25:03.712
- Now you got what you want. Can I go?
- Can you go?

25:04.019 --> 25:06.510
No, you can't go! You stole my car!

25:06.988 --> 25:09.718
Your car? What happened to the old lady?

25:12.227 --> 25:14.991
<i>Did anyone ever tell you</i>
<i>you're a big old grouch?</i>

25:15.063 --> 25:16.052
<i>You're the first.</i>

25:17.299 --> 25:19.961
<i>But you know what?</i>
<i>At least you're a big old sexy grouch.</i>

25:20.035 --> 25:21.229
<i>Thanks.</i>

25:24.172 --> 25:27.005
<i>- Come on. They have pancakes here.</i>
<i>- Angie.</i>

25:29.244 --> 25:33.544
<i>I just killed your husband an hour ago.</i>
<i>I don't want pancakes.</i>

25:33.615 --> 25:37.244
<i>Really? You're gonna go on the run</i>
<i>on an empty stomach?</i>

25:38.420 --> 25:41.116
<i>Come on. I own half a car dealership now.</i>

25:41.189 --> 25:44.215
<i>- I'm rich. I'll buy...</i>
<i>...point that thing at me,</i> payaso!

25:44.292 --> 25:46.192
<i>Can't you see I'm driving?</i>

25:46.261 --> 25:49.321
<i>- Where we going, anyway, man?</i>
<i>- Don't worry about it.</i>

25:49.397 --> 25:51.729
<i>Hey, bro!</i>
<i>You're wasting the beer, man.</i>

25:52.167 --> 25:55.603
<i>- Tripping, man.</i>
<i>- Bro, this car smells like my grandpa.</i>

25:56.705 --> 25:58.570
<i>Your grandpa stinks, bro!</i>

25:58.640 --> 26:02.770
I assume we're no longer looking
at footage of the sting operation.

26:03.511 --> 26:07.413
- Chief, should I fast-forward?
- That would be a good idea. Thank you.

26:07.482 --> 26:10.110
Chief, sorry to interrupt.
Detective Daniels found something

26:10.185 --> 26:12.119
I think you should see.

26:20.195 --> 26:22.493
A bill from Perma-Safe Security

26:22.564 --> 26:24.623
for installation of a wall safe?

26:24.699 --> 26:27.395
And a floor safe we knew nothing about.

26:29.671 --> 26:30.660
Oh!

26:31.506 --> 26:32.973
<i>Yeah, boy!</i>

26:33.041 --> 26:36.306
<i>- You tell them, George.</i>
<i>- Thank you. Thank you.</i>

26:36.378 --> 26:39.905
<i>- Hold the applause. I'm here all week.</i>
<i>- You lied...</i>

26:42.584 --> 26:44.415
Well, it's not a total loss.

26:44.486 --> 26:46.249
We shouldn't have any trouble
prosecuting the guys

26:46.321 --> 26:48.949
who stole Lieutenant Provenza's Civic.

26:50.992 --> 26:54.655
Good luck wrapping this up.
And, Chief Johnson, tick-tock.

26:57.165 --> 26:59.599
What does that mean, "tick-tock"?

27:00.969 --> 27:04.632
It's the sound of the clock
running out on my career.

27:19.020 --> 27:21.284
- Ah!
- The reason I didn't mention it last night

27:21.356 --> 27:24.086
- is because I didn't know it was here.
- You can't drill through the top,

27:24.192 --> 27:26.717
and jackhammering the safe
will take at least two hours.

27:26.795 --> 27:28.490
Or we can pull it out in about five minutes

27:28.563 --> 27:30.360
by hooking a cable to a tow truck and...

27:32.467 --> 27:33.900
Time is money, Mr. Serabian.

27:33.968 --> 27:36.630
Do I use the tow truck, or are you
gonna give me the combination?

27:36.705 --> 27:38.832
I told you, I don't know it.

27:41.376 --> 27:43.173
This is gonna be fun.

28:26.588 --> 28:27.816
Perfect!

28:38.933 --> 28:42.130
- Oh.
- Okay. What do we have here?

28:42.704 --> 28:45.400
This looks like
Alex Serabian's Walther.

28:49.144 --> 28:52.636
With one bullet missing.
But good luck getting prints off of this.

28:52.714 --> 28:56.013
I'm guessing there's $5,000 in each bundle.
And I've got the will.

28:56.084 --> 28:58.382
The portion I highlighted
is what you were interested in.

28:58.453 --> 29:01.422
Uh, Sergeant Gabriel, where are we
with Ms. Serabian's cell phone?

29:01.489 --> 29:03.457
We checked all her calls
over the last three days,

29:03.525 --> 29:05.686
and none of them
seem like potential accomplices.

29:05.760 --> 29:08.661
Chief, I read the brother his rights,
and I put him in 1.

29:08.730 --> 29:10.721
Thank you. Thank you, Detective.

29:10.799 --> 29:14.758
Um... Sergeant Gabriel, Interview Room 1.
Meet you there.

29:14.836 --> 29:17.566
And has anyone seen
Lieutenant Provenza?

29:20.208 --> 29:24.201
Uh, Chief, the last I saw,
he was in Electronics.

29:24.746 --> 29:27.237
So, who had the combination, Chief?

29:28.450 --> 29:29.815
The killer.

29:41.996 --> 29:45.261
If you think I blame myself
for that asshole being dead, well, I don't.

29:45.333 --> 29:48.268
I blame that crappy steering-wheel lock.

29:48.336 --> 29:50.099
If that thing had worked the way
it was supposed to,

29:50.171 --> 29:52.662
none of this would have happened!

29:52.740 --> 29:55.174
Lieutenant, there's no time left
to consider how we got here.

29:55.243 --> 29:58.371
Only how we get out, and if we can,
how we do it with a bit of dignity.

29:58.446 --> 29:59.777
Oh.

30:01.382 --> 30:04.044
It is way too late for that.

30:04.986 --> 30:07.181
Pull it together.

30:07.288 --> 30:10.553
For the next hour,
I need the stubborn, cynical,

30:10.625 --> 30:14.083
rude, suspicious know-it-all
you've always tried to be.

30:14.162 --> 30:16.153
After that, we'll see.

30:21.236 --> 30:25.263
Oh, my God. It's about time.
I've been here all by myself forever.

30:25.607 --> 30:28.667
I don't have any magazines.
I don't have my phone.

30:28.743 --> 30:30.335
And I'm a widow.

30:30.812 --> 30:33.804
Ms. Serabian, I know how fond you are
of Lieutenant Provenza here,

30:33.882 --> 30:36.749
so I imagine that you will be
delighted to know

30:36.818 --> 30:40.117
that we have recovered his car
and all its contents.

30:40.555 --> 30:43.422
- Isn't that wonderful?
- I don't believe you.

30:43.958 --> 30:45.152
Well.

30:49.964 --> 30:51.556
Believe her now?

30:52.300 --> 30:56.066
For our purposes, it doesn't matter
if you gave Lieutenant Provenza $20,000

30:56.137 --> 30:57.195
or $20.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.968
<i>You asked him to murder</i>
<i>your husband, you paid him,</i>

31:00.041 --> 31:02.373
<i>and we have it all,</i>
<i>clear as day, on videotape.</i>

31:02.443 --> 31:04.673
- Not anymore, we don't.
- Can we skip

31:04.746 --> 31:06.407
- the commentary track, please?
<i>- I keep telling you,</i>

31:06.481 --> 31:10.110
- I didn't kill my husband!
- I'm quite certain of that.

31:10.184 --> 31:12.209
Then what am I still doing here?

31:12.287 --> 31:14.551
Angie, just listen to her, huh?

31:14.656 --> 31:17.853
Because, Ms. Serabian, I have no interest

31:17.926 --> 31:22.158
in prosecuting you for attempted murder
when I have an actual murder to solve.

31:22.230 --> 31:25.063
And I think that I can find the killer
if you'll only tell me

31:25.133 --> 31:27.863
how you got the combination to the safe.

31:41.849 --> 31:44.283
Alex's brother gave it to me.

31:45.453 --> 31:47.114
Thank you so much.

31:47.989 --> 31:49.718
I'll be back in two shakes.

31:49.791 --> 31:52.817
But I will leave Lieutenant Provenza here
to keep you company.

31:52.894 --> 31:53.952
Now that she's off the hook,

31:54.028 --> 31:56.496
maybe you two can patch things up.

32:09.010 --> 32:10.944
Oh, my, Mr. Serabian.

32:11.012 --> 32:13.879
You look uncomfortable.
Can we get you something?

32:13.948 --> 32:16.439
- A glass of water?
- Or a sponge?

32:18.453 --> 32:21.047
Let me get to the point, Mr. Serabian.

32:21.122 --> 32:24.922
Because, in pursuing my investigation,
I have come to a conclusion that

32:24.993 --> 32:28.121
I think you will find extremely distressing.

32:28.930 --> 32:31.091
- You have?
- I'm afraid so.

32:31.165 --> 32:32.792
I am convinced

32:34.335 --> 32:37.771
that your sister-in-law, Angie,
murdered your brother.

32:38.439 --> 32:40.430
I know. It's so horrible.

32:42.143 --> 32:44.168
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

32:44.545 --> 32:46.308
Why? Are you surprised?

32:46.381 --> 32:48.975
No, no. I mean, from the moment I learned

32:49.050 --> 32:51.848
that Angie was trying to kill my brother,
I knew she would do it.

32:51.919 --> 32:53.784
She's very determined.

32:53.955 --> 32:56.446
Well, I just have a few loose threads

32:56.524 --> 32:58.856
that I need to stitch up, Mr. Serabian.

32:58.926 --> 33:02.555
Please, call me Hovnan.

33:03.364 --> 33:05.491
Thank you, Hov... Hov...

33:05.566 --> 33:06.999
- Hovnan.
- Hovnan.

33:07.168 --> 33:09.636
- Hovnan.
- Havnan.

33:09.704 --> 33:11.535
<i>- Hovnan.</i>
<i>- Havan?</i>

33:11.606 --> 33:13.631
- Hovnan.
- Havana? Havnana?

33:13.708 --> 33:17.007
It's okay. Just please call me Hank.
Everybody does.

33:18.546 --> 33:21.447
So, Hank, a short while ago,

33:21.516 --> 33:25.509
we opened the safe we retrieved
from your office, and guess what.

33:25.586 --> 33:28.851
Inside, we found the gun
Angie used to kill your brother.

33:28.923 --> 33:31.448
- It was in the safe?
- How about that.

33:31.626 --> 33:35.187
Of course, that would mean Angie
would have to have the combination.

33:35.263 --> 33:37.993
And I need to find out how she got that.

33:40.802 --> 33:43.362
I know you told us
that you didn't have the combination,

33:43.438 --> 33:46.100
and it must be terribly embarrassing now
to admit that you did,

33:46.174 --> 33:50.270
but we all tell little white lies
from time to time. I know I have.

33:50.344 --> 33:52.744
- Have you, Sergeant?
- Nope. Never.

33:53.347 --> 33:55.440
I just want to make sure
that the right person goes to jail

33:55.516 --> 33:58.349
for Alex's murder, and knowing who all
had the combination

33:58.419 --> 34:00.853
would make that immensely helpful.

34:01.756 --> 34:06.022
Yes. Only Alex and I had the combination,
and I gave it to Angie.

34:06.728 --> 34:09.161
<i>And why, exactly,</i>
<i>did you do that?</i>

34:12.867 --> 34:13.958
Hank?

34:14.502 --> 34:15.969
I gave her the combination,

34:16.036 --> 34:18.027
because Angie came to me and said

34:18.106 --> 34:20.734
she needed $20,000 to
make her problems go away.

34:20.808 --> 34:23.072
And when you found out that
the problem was your brother,

34:23.143 --> 34:26.773
- you must've felt terribly betrayed.
- Yes, terribly! I felt terribly betrayed!

34:26.848 --> 34:30.648
And I knew Alex would think
that I gave her the money, and...

34:31.185 --> 34:32.880
- Which I didn't!
- No, you merely gave her

34:32.954 --> 34:34.683
the combination to the safe
that contained the money,

34:34.755 --> 34:36.985
so that she could get the money herself.

34:37.058 --> 34:40.789
Which is why, I imagine,
you were so desperate to return it.

34:41.728 --> 34:45.460
I took Alex's gun from the safe
to put the money underneath,

34:45.766 --> 34:48.463
and that's when Angie walked in.
And I said,

34:48.536 --> 34:49.525
"How could you do this?

34:49.603 --> 34:51.969
"How could you take my brother's money
to have someone kill him?"

34:52.039 --> 34:54.667
And she said,
"You know how he treats me? Like a dog."

34:54.742 --> 34:56.869
And I said,
"No. He's my brother. I love him.

34:56.944 --> 34:59.310
"Go away.
I don't ever want to see you again!"

34:59.380 --> 35:01.610
And just then, Alex walked in.

35:02.717 --> 35:05.686
- That must have been awkward.
- Yes. Very, very awkward.

35:05.753 --> 35:06.742
Hmm.

35:07.155 --> 35:10.386
And he said, "How could you, my wife,
and you, my brother, do this to me?"

35:10.458 --> 35:13.052
And I said, "It's not me.
It's Angie. It's all her fault."

35:13.127 --> 35:14.788
And Angie grabbed the gun and said,

35:14.862 --> 35:18.161
"I should have done this myself
in the first place!"

35:18.533 --> 35:20.228
Yeah! And she shot Alex.

35:22.336 --> 35:26.033
And Angie said
that police would suspect me,

35:26.908 --> 35:29.843
and it'd be better
if we say nothing of what happened.

35:29.911 --> 35:30.900
Oh.

35:33.347 --> 35:37.147
- And then you walked out together.
- Yes, yes. We walked away.

35:46.994 --> 35:48.791
What is your problem?

35:50.064 --> 35:53.795
That's a really great story, Hank.
But I have a better one.

35:54.168 --> 35:55.328
At 9:00 p.m. Last night,

35:55.403 --> 35:59.863
we saw your sister-in-law, Angie,
walk by herself into Serabian Motors.

36:00.274 --> 36:03.141
Not one minute later, she walked out,
again, by herself.

36:03.211 --> 36:05.372
There was no time for her
to have retrieved the gun,

36:05.446 --> 36:08.279
shot him, and placed it back in the safe.

36:09.317 --> 36:11.182
She could have done it very, very quickly.

36:11.252 --> 36:13.618
We would have heard a gunshot. No.

36:13.688 --> 36:15.918
The only reasonable explanation is,

36:15.990 --> 36:19.084
AlEXConfronted you
when you tried to return the money,

36:19.160 --> 36:21.560
and so you took the gun and shot him.

36:21.629 --> 36:24.928
Isn't that what happened?
You shot your own brother.

36:25.800 --> 36:27.893
But why? Why would I do that?

36:27.969 --> 36:31.302
Angie kept talking about how
she was inheriting half a car dealership,

36:31.372 --> 36:34.136
and it got me wondering,
"Who gets the other half?"

36:34.208 --> 36:37.336
And according to Alex's will,
that would be you.

36:38.079 --> 36:41.606
And when she failed to knock him off,
despite all your backhanded help,

36:41.682 --> 36:44.708
you took matters into your own hands
and shot him yourself.

36:44.785 --> 36:47.845
- Didn't you shoot him?
- I shot him! I shot him!

36:50.725 --> 36:53.592
But I wasn't aiming at him.

36:57.298 --> 37:00.961
Well, we're just gonna have
to let the jury sort that out.

37:01.869 --> 37:04.531
Sergeant Gabriel, would you
please arrest Mr. Serabian here,

37:04.605 --> 37:07.403
while I go check on Lieutenant Provenza?

37:09.510 --> 37:12.308
This is... This is all Angie's fault.

37:12.380 --> 37:14.348
And now what? She's gonna walk away?

37:14.415 --> 37:16.679
No, more than likely, she drives away.

37:16.751 --> 37:18.776
In your brother's Jaguar.

37:26.427 --> 37:29.055
<i>Maybe I wasn't completely</i>
<i>honest with you...</i>

37:29.130 --> 37:30.791
He's like a minute from closing...

37:30.865 --> 37:31.854
Shh.

37:32.333 --> 37:35.268
You weren't exactly truthful
with me, either.

37:35.436 --> 37:36.528
What?

37:37.004 --> 37:39.336
No. What makes you think
I wasn't being truthful?

37:39.407 --> 37:43.343
For starters, you handed me
that pile of bogus money.

37:43.711 --> 37:46.578
I mean, so much for establishing trust.

37:48.716 --> 37:52.652
No. I know. But, you see, I was afraid that

37:52.753 --> 37:56.883
if I gave you the money,
I would never see you again.

37:57.291 --> 38:00.351
- What?
- What? Yeah, and...

38:03.464 --> 38:05.591
I can't tell you.

38:07.468 --> 38:10.926
Angie. Angie.

38:18.713 --> 38:21.307
I know that you didn't kill Alex.

38:22.950 --> 38:24.440
So talk to me.

38:27.621 --> 38:28.815
Well...

38:30.825 --> 38:31.985
<i>I...</i>

38:33.494 --> 38:34.791
It's hard for me to say this,

38:34.862 --> 38:39.060
but I was just thinking that

38:41.068 --> 38:44.526
maybe the only reason you were
interested in me is because

38:44.605 --> 38:47.130
I was paying you to kill my husband.

38:50.177 --> 38:53.374
Oh. Angie. Angie.

38:59.320 --> 39:02.050
That's just not true. No, it's not true.

39:03.557 --> 39:07.323
And there is no reason that
we still can't get together.

39:08.229 --> 39:09.856
- Really?
- Really.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.624
Really. But since we're being honest...

39:14.802 --> 39:17.669
Angie,
I have to tell you something.

39:17.905 --> 39:19.873
I have to tell you,

39:22.043 --> 39:24.238
that by the time you're available,

39:25.579 --> 39:26.978
you may be too old for me.

39:30.684 --> 39:32.379
What do you mean by that?

39:32.453 --> 39:35.047
Well, you just confessed
to attempted murder,

39:35.122 --> 39:37.852
and you're going to prison
for at least 10 years.

39:37.925 --> 39:39.085
But...

39:39.693 --> 39:42.719
But she said she wasn't interested
in attempted murder.

39:42.797 --> 39:44.389
Well, she isn't.

39:45.733 --> 39:46.995
But I am.

40:07.455 --> 40:08.547
Yeah?

40:11.459 --> 40:13.654
Well, congratulations, Lieutenant.

40:13.727 --> 40:16.059
Yeah, I know. You're thrilled.

40:16.363 --> 40:20.823
Uh, I just dropped by to tell you that
I am never going to retire.

40:21.335 --> 40:23.530
- Ever.
- Why?

40:24.171 --> 40:27.607
Look, I'm not gonna tell you
that I'm Charlie Hustle.

40:28.008 --> 40:32.274
The only thing I chase these days
are women who have had a few drinks.

40:32.680 --> 40:33.772
Okay.

40:34.014 --> 40:36.949
But if you want to save a couple of bucks

40:37.017 --> 40:41.954
out of our division's budget
by trading my experience for a rookie...

40:46.427 --> 40:47.860
I have a civil-service job,

40:47.928 --> 40:52.194
and the only way that I am going to leave
the Los Angeles Police Department

40:52.266 --> 40:56.259
is if I get shot, have a heart attack,
and then you run me over.

40:58.205 --> 40:59.695
After which,

41:00.107 --> 41:02.735
I will consider a disability position.

41:04.512 --> 41:08.209
But you really still haven't told me why.

41:12.353 --> 41:14.787
When my first wife and I divorced,

41:15.689 --> 41:19.420
I agreed to split my pension
with her from the day I retire.

41:20.528 --> 41:23.053
I'll be damned if she gets a nickel.

41:24.465 --> 41:27.332
