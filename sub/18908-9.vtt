WEBVTT

00:00.063 --> 00:02.344
Previously on "Colony"...

00:02.368 --> 00:03.609
I know you took the file.

00:03.634 --> 00:05.765
I didn't take anything from your house.

00:06.047 --> 00:08.250
You get us something from that suit.

00:09.117 --> 00:11.217
Holy shit, it worked.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.210
Whoa, why are you taking the gauntlet?

00:13.235 --> 00:14.646
Hennessey's gonna hold on to it.

00:14.671 --> 00:16.812
We'll take good care of it.

00:16.938 --> 00:18.672
- What happened?
- Someone left a loose end

00:18.698 --> 00:20.507
at the safe house yesterday.

00:20.532 --> 00:21.625
Will's in trouble.

00:21.650 --> 00:23.843
His team raided one of
the Red Hand safe houses.

00:23.879 --> 00:26.680
Will found a kid hiding
inside and helped him escape,

00:26.715 --> 00:28.181
and now they're out looking for the kid.

00:28.216 --> 00:30.316
- Who are you?
- You're not safe here.

00:30.359 --> 00:32.151
Katie, we've got company.

00:32.969 --> 00:34.134
Hey!

00:34.159 --> 00:36.256
How did you escape the safe house?

00:36.291 --> 00:38.324
They're gonna torture him.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.060
Come on. We have to go now.

00:40.095 --> 00:41.584
I will not tolerate...

00:47.269 --> 00:50.036
- Where are they?
- They've been relocated.

00:53.138 --> 00:54.541
Bram.

01:15.263 --> 01:17.985
Hey, we got to get in the
air before a patrol spots us.

01:18.010 --> 01:20.900
Plane hasn't been flown in over a year.

01:20.925 --> 01:24.215
Just gotta make sure the
engine doesn't conk out.

01:24.473 --> 01:26.139
There has to be another way.

01:26.174 --> 01:27.474
Yeah? Like what?

01:27.509 --> 01:29.109
Teleportation?

01:29.144 --> 01:31.111
This plane has no electronics.

01:31.146 --> 01:32.912
They won't see us coming.

01:32.948 --> 01:34.814
Yeah, but that's... see,
that's just a theory.

01:34.850 --> 01:37.150
It's a theory that's been tested.

01:37.185 --> 01:41.646
Their sensors on the walls
don't care about analog signals.

01:42.412 --> 01:43.923
What about the drones?

01:43.959 --> 01:45.425
We'll come out of the sun,

01:45.460 --> 01:47.936
and we'll bail out
before they can spot us.

01:47.961 --> 01:49.733
It's gonna work.

01:51.032 --> 01:53.349
- I hate flying.
- Yeah?

01:53.397 --> 01:55.591
Should've thought of that
before you volunteered.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.949
We're good. Let's go.

02:35.877 --> 02:38.501
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah.

02:59.367 --> 03:01.601
Come on. We gotta get out of here.

03:27.429 --> 03:28.962
Are you okay?

03:38.764 --> 03:42.177
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

03:45.979 --> 03:47.211
Go ahead.

04:15.977 --> 04:18.314
A plane flew in from outside the bloc.

04:18.339 --> 04:20.736
Drone shot this guy down,
but his partner escaped

04:20.761 --> 04:21.939
and went to ground.

04:21.964 --> 04:24.884
Why would somebody want to
fly a plane into the bloc?

04:24.920 --> 04:26.920
I plan on asking him.

04:28.924 --> 04:32.992
I didn't realize your wife
was related to Madeline Kenner.

04:33.028 --> 04:34.627
Yeah. They're sisters.

04:34.663 --> 04:36.162
Oh, oh.

04:36.197 --> 04:38.264
According to your
file, they both grew up

04:38.300 --> 04:39.966
in a military family.

04:40.001 --> 04:42.302
- Navy.
- Mm.

04:42.337 --> 04:44.170
Typically, military families are close.

04:44.205 --> 04:45.738
Do they fight much?

04:45.774 --> 04:47.507
Like I said, they're sisters.

04:47.542 --> 04:50.410
How often does your wife go visit
Ms. Kenner in the Green Zone?

04:50.445 --> 04:51.911
What's with all the questions?

04:51.947 --> 04:54.113
I just want to get to
know the Bowman family

04:54.149 --> 04:55.281
a little bit better.

04:55.317 --> 04:56.725
Let's talk about you, Bob.

04:56.750 --> 04:58.151
What's your story?

04:58.186 --> 05:00.019
Any family? Friends?

05:00.055 --> 05:02.488
Or you just power down in a
closet at work every night?

05:02.524 --> 05:05.460
Oh, I've got a lot of
friends. Good ones, actually.

05:05.485 --> 05:07.860
Probably because I understand
that our line of work

05:07.896 --> 05:10.244
and friendship doesn't mix.

05:14.202 --> 05:15.501
Good talk.

05:21.643 --> 05:24.477
We're gonna need to bag all
this up for the Blackjacks.

05:24.512 --> 05:26.903
Go get your equipment from the van.

05:44.032 --> 05:46.366
The dead jumper is Darin Gunn,

05:46.401 --> 05:48.234
a former lieutenant in the Marines.

05:48.269 --> 05:50.370
Seems to have been outside
the Walls during the Arrival.

05:50.405 --> 05:52.126
Yes. I don't care who he is.

05:52.151 --> 05:54.392
I want to know what you're
doing to find his partner,

05:54.417 --> 05:55.950
the one who escaped.

05:56.181 --> 05:58.822
Let's not make this bigger than it is.

05:59.009 --> 06:02.181
We'll cover up the crash site,
I'll tell a convincing story,

06:02.217 --> 06:03.916
and by next week, nobody in my bloc

06:03.952 --> 06:06.025
will even remember what happened.

06:06.955 --> 06:10.156
Recent reports from IGA
intelligence indicate

06:10.191 --> 06:11.724
that there is a growing
Resistance movement

06:11.760 --> 06:13.514
outside the Colony.

06:13.728 --> 06:15.228
What if this was an attempt

06:15.263 --> 06:17.216
to recover our host's missing gauntlet

06:17.241 --> 06:19.564
and take it beyond our Walls?

06:19.589 --> 06:21.255
That seems unlikely.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.003
Well, it doesn't have to be true.

06:24.039 --> 06:27.341
IGA simply needs to think
that it's a possibility.

06:27.366 --> 06:29.876
Let's not fixate on
the worst-case scenario.

06:29.911 --> 06:32.850
Things are trending upward in the bloc.

06:33.116 --> 06:35.014
You're right.

06:35.050 --> 06:37.283
I'll have to remember
to remain optimistic

06:37.318 --> 06:39.535
as we're all being renditioned.

06:40.789 --> 06:42.188
Find the pilot.

06:42.223 --> 06:45.293
It'll be good for you and your bloc.

06:45.432 --> 06:46.798
Understand?

06:46.823 --> 06:48.621
Yes, ma'am.

07:24.472 --> 07:26.271
Hi, sweetie.

07:28.636 --> 07:30.670
- What's going on?
- I was in the neighborhood,

07:30.705 --> 07:33.380
so I thought I'd give
you a ride to work.

07:37.489 --> 07:39.579
Hey, so...

07:39.614 --> 07:41.342
when Bram wakes up,

07:41.367 --> 07:43.683
tell him to stay here, okay?

07:44.310 --> 07:45.795
Okay.

07:45.820 --> 07:47.622
We'll be home soon.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.090
All they do is sleep.

07:51.126 --> 07:54.460
They're boys, my love.
They hibernate like bears.

07:55.504 --> 07:57.755
- See you tonight.
- Bye.

08:08.053 --> 08:10.109
You think the pilot
might still be alive?

08:10.145 --> 08:12.006
He escaped into the bloc.

08:12.031 --> 08:14.457
So we have to find him
before the Occupation.

08:14.482 --> 08:17.016
The dead jumper had a
radio in his backpack.

08:17.271 --> 08:19.727
I memorized the frequency
and then scrambled it.

08:19.845 --> 08:21.311
Will Bowman...

08:21.336 --> 08:23.156
that's a clever piece of sabotage.

08:23.191 --> 08:25.558
Just trying to keep up.

08:25.593 --> 08:26.859
I'll go to Broussard.

08:26.895 --> 08:28.294
If the pilot really is Resistance,

08:28.329 --> 08:29.917
he might reach out.

08:33.568 --> 08:34.885
Okay.

08:35.299 --> 08:37.245
Come on, let's go!

08:37.739 --> 08:40.681
Bob's been asking questions about you.

08:41.525 --> 08:43.576
Do you think they broke
the kid from the safe house?

08:43.611 --> 08:46.412
- I don't know.
- Don't go back to the office.

08:46.447 --> 08:48.861
Once we disappear, the
kids are fugitives...

08:48.886 --> 08:50.333
forever.

08:53.046 --> 08:56.714
Let's meet for lunch,
exchange notes, okay?

08:58.695 --> 08:59.994
Be safe.

09:00.019 --> 09:01.349
I will.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.304
So Hennessey knew a plane was coming?

09:07.329 --> 09:08.935
He didn't say that exactly.

09:08.970 --> 09:10.870
But he told me he had spoken to a group

09:10.905 --> 09:13.882
outside the bloc that
wanted to make contact.

09:14.309 --> 09:17.210
I assumed he meant a cell that was in...

09:17.245 --> 09:20.947
San Fernando or Santa Monica.

09:27.565 --> 09:30.566
The green glove...
something very valuable.

09:31.893 --> 09:34.767
Listen, Blake, if you
let me go, it's yours.

09:34.792 --> 09:37.129
It's worth enough to make you
rich for the rest of your life.

09:37.165 --> 09:39.165
- Yeah?
- Look at those gems.

09:40.268 --> 09:41.738
Hey.

09:43.004 --> 09:45.551
We came about the pilot.

09:45.973 --> 09:48.608
In peacetime, I'm an
art dealer, antiques.

09:48.879 --> 09:51.377
Have a shop in London,
Paris, even New York.

09:51.412 --> 09:52.757
You've probably heard of it.

09:55.140 --> 09:56.492
Never been there.

09:56.517 --> 09:57.780
Blake...

09:58.329 --> 09:59.913
We gotta go.

10:00.154 --> 10:02.321
- What...
- Come on, let's go.

10:21.678 --> 10:23.803
Bowman is working for the Resistance.

10:27.662 --> 10:28.981
I can't help but wonder

10:29.017 --> 10:30.650
whether your opinion in this matter

10:30.685 --> 10:33.352
is influenced by personal animosity.

10:33.388 --> 10:36.188
We had cameras up on
the Bowman residence.

10:36.224 --> 10:38.090
Do you remember that "eyes only" file

10:38.126 --> 10:39.859
that was mysteriously downloaded

10:39.894 --> 10:43.503
from Deputy Proxy
Burgess's home computer?

10:43.798 --> 10:47.166
The deputy's girlfriend happens
to be Katie Bowman's sister.

10:47.201 --> 10:49.435
Last Tuesday, she went over to her house

10:49.470 --> 10:52.071
and accused her of stealing
the file at a party.

10:58.461 --> 11:01.380
Nolan Burgess is the
Proxy's right-hand man.

11:01.416 --> 11:03.816
Does that make him immune to the law?

11:08.056 --> 11:10.623
Dig deeper. If you're right,

11:10.658 --> 11:13.893
maybe we can use Bowman
to catch Broussard.

11:13.928 --> 11:16.362
But tread carefully.

11:50.033 --> 11:52.133
Where was he keeping the gauntlet?

11:57.138 --> 11:58.771
Who else knew that Hennessey had it?

11:58.796 --> 12:01.730
Nobody. Far as I know.

12:08.430 --> 12:11.197
Hey, Will said the jumper
was carrying a radio.

12:11.883 --> 12:14.100
Could that be how Hennessey
was in touch with him?

12:14.135 --> 12:16.703
Well, this is a shortwave set.

12:16.905 --> 12:18.571
That reach outside the bloc?

12:18.607 --> 12:20.750
It can reach halfway around the world.

12:26.330 --> 12:27.947
Los Angeles, this is Den Mother.

12:27.983 --> 12:29.649
Do you copy? Over.

12:32.271 --> 12:34.831
This is Los Angeles. Over.

12:35.036 --> 12:37.036
I need today's code.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.499
Hey.

12:49.171 --> 12:50.679
What if it's like our old system,

12:50.704 --> 12:52.444
and all we need is the book?

12:54.227 --> 12:56.527
Los Angeles, do you copy?

12:59.381 --> 13:02.039
We have a, uh, situation here.

13:02.064 --> 13:04.422
Our contact has been killed but, um...

13:05.580 --> 13:06.905
Emergency protocol!

13:06.930 --> 13:09.232
All outlets shift to
signal two immediately!

13:14.469 --> 13:16.039
Who the hell was that?

13:19.422 --> 13:22.117
I've got a team going through the
archive footage from the Bowman house,

13:22.142 --> 13:24.508
but he and his wife are
almost scrupulously boring.

13:24.533 --> 13:26.714
Like they know they're being watched.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.318
We also found an odd anomaly.

13:28.343 --> 13:30.376
Some of the earlier
surveillance files are missing.

13:30.412 --> 13:32.278
What do you mean, "missing"?

13:32.314 --> 13:34.881
I thought we had built
redundancies into the system.

13:34.916 --> 13:38.200
We did. Which is how I knew the
files must have been deleted.

13:38.325 --> 13:40.687
I went back and examined the logs.

13:40.722 --> 13:42.955
All the files were erased
from the same computer terminal

13:42.991 --> 13:45.223
over a 15-minute period.

13:46.176 --> 13:48.628
- Jennifer McMahon.
- Yes.

13:48.663 --> 13:51.692
See if you can find a way
to restore that footage.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.579
Hey.

14:06.614 --> 14:08.934
How's the, uh, washing
machine holding up?

14:08.959 --> 14:10.425
Good.

14:10.585 --> 14:12.352
I need a radio.

14:12.614 --> 14:14.020
Got a lot of 'em.

14:14.055 --> 14:15.388
I need a military-style radio,

14:15.423 --> 14:17.731
one with VINSON encryption protocol.

14:19.264 --> 14:21.474
Hey, man, I just fix car stereos, man.

14:21.499 --> 14:23.465
I-I wouldn't know anything about that.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.163
It's for a case.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.402
We're always looking
for somebody at work

14:29.437 --> 14:31.077
to maintain our equipment.

14:32.015 --> 14:33.773
It's extra rations, easy job.

14:33.808 --> 14:35.508
I could put in a good word for ya.

14:36.116 --> 14:37.412
Okay.

14:37.437 --> 14:38.945
I've got nothing with VINSON.

14:38.980 --> 14:40.213
Those things were collector's items

14:40.248 --> 14:42.218
even before the Occupation.

14:43.785 --> 14:46.552
Say someone was listening
on a certain channel

14:46.588 --> 14:47.999
with a VINSON set.

14:48.024 --> 14:49.889
If I broadcast on a normal radio,

14:49.924 --> 14:51.827
would they be able to hear me?

14:52.127 --> 14:55.015
Sure. They'd just know
it wasn't encrypted.

14:57.465 --> 14:59.687
I'm gonna need to borrow your equipment.

15:00.699 --> 15:03.645
Uh, so you just hit that and, um...

15:04.012 --> 15:05.571
you're live.

15:17.252 --> 15:19.218
Hello. I'm looking for the pilot

15:19.243 --> 15:22.241
who bailed out over Los
Angeles this morning.

15:22.553 --> 15:23.723
I can help you.

15:26.444 --> 15:27.787
Help him?

15:30.799 --> 15:32.287
Your partner's been killed,

15:32.312 --> 15:34.600
and the entire Occupation
is looking for you,

15:34.636 --> 15:36.936
but me and my friends are on your team.

15:37.054 --> 15:40.015
We just wanna talk. Over.

15:52.388 --> 15:54.021
Emmett.

15:55.692 --> 15:57.116
Emmett.

15:59.014 --> 16:01.765
It's time for you to come clean.

16:06.943 --> 16:10.171
When we hit your terrorist lair,

16:10.872 --> 16:13.155
you said that you hid
in the crawl space.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.714
But I know that isn't the whole story.

16:21.249 --> 16:23.284
This man helped you.

16:28.890 --> 16:31.040
I know something else.

16:32.353 --> 16:35.399
When we came to arrest you
at the other safe house,

16:35.591 --> 16:38.220
you ran out before we hit the door.

16:41.055 --> 16:44.712
Because you were tipped... right?

16:47.407 --> 16:48.674
I just had a bad feeling.

16:48.710 --> 16:50.376
You're lying!

16:53.047 --> 16:55.372
It's... obvious.

16:57.352 --> 17:00.966
Did this man tip you again?

17:03.758 --> 17:05.232
You know...

17:05.859 --> 17:07.560
I doubt you're having

17:07.595 --> 17:10.912
a very enjoyable time here, Emmett.

17:13.734 --> 17:16.646
But it could get much worse.

17:24.646 --> 17:26.973
A lady came to my apartment.

17:28.209 --> 17:30.583
Brown hair and eyes.

17:30.993 --> 17:32.326
Skinny.

17:34.357 --> 17:36.355
Do you remember that mysterious woman

17:36.391 --> 17:38.424
on the subway platform?

17:38.459 --> 17:40.573
Broussard's accomplice...

17:40.936 --> 17:43.837
the one who helped him kill our Host.

17:44.899 --> 17:46.580
I know who it was.

17:50.238 --> 17:51.804
Katie Bowman.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.024
Move, move, move!

19:04.260 --> 19:06.375
You take left, I'll take right.

19:07.305 --> 19:09.430
- What are you doing here?
- Sit down.

19:09.465 --> 19:11.799
- Did my father send you?
- Sit down...

19:11.834 --> 19:14.328
... or I'll make you sit down.

19:18.384 --> 19:20.406
- Come here.
- All clear.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.805
No sign of the wife, but
we've got the three kids.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.883
Sorry about Hennessey.

19:31.788 --> 19:34.344
- Was he a friend?
- No.

19:35.211 --> 19:36.779
But I trusted him.

19:36.917 --> 19:40.585
Which I guess these days
is almost the same thing.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.799
Your husband's late.

19:44.834 --> 19:46.500
He'll be here.

20:06.032 --> 20:08.199
Subject just took a
right turn onto Beverly.

20:08.224 --> 20:10.683
What are the rules of engagement
if he's meeting his wife?

20:10.708 --> 20:12.103
I wanna take them both.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.561
We should hold out for Broussard.

20:13.596 --> 20:16.284
Wait too long, and we
might end up with nothing.

20:19.035 --> 20:21.836
Okay, we move if he meets his wife.

20:22.001 --> 20:25.501
Subject is stopping on
the 4300 block of Beverly.

21:03.815 --> 21:05.548
Will's blown.

21:05.882 --> 21:07.014
What?

21:07.049 --> 21:08.749
He just walked right past here

21:08.784 --> 21:10.744
and into a coffee shop.

21:11.447 --> 21:13.220
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

21:19.884 --> 21:21.064
Charlotte's.

21:22.986 --> 21:25.939
Is there an Alex Graham here?

21:27.573 --> 21:28.853
Yeah.

21:32.108 --> 21:33.616
Thank you.

21:33.702 --> 21:35.109
This is Graham.

21:35.144 --> 21:36.628
What's going on?

21:36.653 --> 21:38.420
I'm being followed.

21:38.445 --> 21:40.147
What are you gonna do?

21:40.182 --> 21:41.982
I'll try to slip 'em,
but I can't make my move

21:42.018 --> 21:43.515
till you and the kids are safe.

21:43.540 --> 21:45.819
Did you find out anything on the pilot?

21:45.855 --> 21:48.822
Um... a contact of Broussard's,

21:48.858 --> 21:50.202
a guy named Hennessey.

21:50.248 --> 21:52.737
We think that he knew
that the pilot was coming.

21:52.762 --> 21:54.662
- Did you talk to him?
- We tried.

21:54.697 --> 21:56.964
- He's dead.
- Can we get up on that call?

21:56.999 --> 21:58.569
Working on it. 45 more seconds.

21:58.594 --> 22:00.268
He's on to us. I guarantee it.

22:00.303 --> 22:01.671
We have to move!

22:04.307 --> 22:05.639
Fine.

22:07.310 --> 22:08.676
Take him down!

22:12.315 --> 22:13.614
They're coming for me.

22:15.518 --> 22:17.918
- Get out of there!
- It's too late.

22:17.954 --> 22:19.308
Get the kids and go underground,

22:19.333 --> 22:20.588
'cause if they're coming for me,

22:20.623 --> 22:22.527
they're coming for all of us.

22:22.552 --> 22:23.691
Hands in the air!

22:23.726 --> 22:24.831
I love you.

22:24.856 --> 22:26.370
- Get down!
- Hands on the counter!

22:42.513 --> 22:44.484
They might have tracked
that conversation.

22:44.520 --> 22:46.454
We've gotta go.

22:47.523 --> 22:48.789
They took him.

22:48.814 --> 22:50.714
Then there's nothing you can do.

22:50.739 --> 22:53.191
You have to trust
Will to handle himself.

22:54.925 --> 22:57.559
My kids are in danger. Will you help?

22:57.844 --> 22:59.210
Of course.

23:05.214 --> 23:06.940
Did you know I was Internal Affairs

23:06.975 --> 23:08.641
before the Arrival?

23:09.339 --> 23:11.097
Of course you were.

23:11.717 --> 23:13.230
That's exactly the attitude

23:13.255 --> 23:15.247
I used to get from guys like you.

23:16.952 --> 23:19.138
Never really bothered me.

23:19.558 --> 23:23.827
The IA was the fence that
kept the cowboys on the range.

23:24.106 --> 23:27.161
And... you can never
really blame a cowboy

23:27.186 --> 23:29.052
for hating a fence.

23:30.599 --> 23:32.165
It turned out that my old job

23:32.200 --> 23:34.501
made me a perfect fit
for this new world.

23:34.536 --> 23:38.004
You see, we're not here to solve cases.

23:38.039 --> 23:40.173
We're here to solve problems.

23:42.245 --> 23:45.748
Nobody above us gives a shit

23:45.814 --> 23:47.567
about who did what and why.

23:47.592 --> 23:50.793
They just want us all
to stay on the range.

23:50.886 --> 23:53.486
They cared who took the RAP.

23:53.522 --> 23:55.778
That's a problem that I solved.

23:55.803 --> 23:57.469
Because you were involved.

23:57.494 --> 23:58.827
You're just throwing
shit against the wall

23:58.852 --> 24:00.957
and hoping it sticks.

24:04.199 --> 24:06.082
This is your wife.

24:06.535 --> 24:08.348
On the subway platform...

24:08.373 --> 24:10.908
before the attack on our Host.

24:12.253 --> 24:14.135
With Broussard.

24:16.635 --> 24:18.494
That's not my wife.

24:18.519 --> 24:20.113
Will...

24:21.666 --> 24:23.666
look at me.

24:25.344 --> 24:27.316
I'm telling you,

24:27.746 --> 24:30.219
from one professional to another,

24:30.719 --> 24:32.482
I'm not fishing.

24:32.517 --> 24:34.742
We have everything.

24:35.420 --> 24:37.586
Including your kids.

24:43.051 --> 24:44.350
Where are they?

24:44.375 --> 24:45.807
Secure.

24:50.702 --> 24:52.632
You've seen me work.

24:52.871 --> 24:55.202
You know what I'll
do to get what I need.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.746
You can save them.

25:04.073 --> 25:06.374
Just lead us to Broussard.

25:15.427 --> 25:17.102
I can't.

25:18.161 --> 25:19.861
He doesn't trust me.

25:24.202 --> 25:25.535
But I can give you something you need

25:25.570 --> 25:27.670
almost as much as Broussard.

25:30.475 --> 25:32.076
The pilot.

25:33.797 --> 25:35.570
Don't listen to him.

25:36.117 --> 25:38.694
Give me time... he will
lead us to everything.

25:38.719 --> 25:39.816
We don't have time.

25:39.851 --> 25:42.062
Right now the priority is the pilot,

25:42.087 --> 25:43.453
and this department needs a win.

25:43.478 --> 25:45.111
You want a win?

25:45.223 --> 25:46.823
He is the real prize,

25:46.858 --> 25:49.148
the key to unlocking everything!

25:53.880 --> 25:56.013
How can you get the pilot?

26:00.645 --> 26:02.372
Is VINSON automatically activated?

26:02.407 --> 26:05.175
Yeah. All outgoing
transmissions will be encrypted.

26:08.680 --> 26:10.814
Hello. I'm looking for the pilot

26:10.849 --> 26:12.882
who bailed out over Los Angeles.

26:20.049 --> 26:21.844
I'm working with Hennessey.

26:21.869 --> 26:24.194
We've been expecting your arrival.

26:31.829 --> 26:34.169
What happened to Hennessey?

26:36.067 --> 26:37.552
He's dead.

26:37.577 --> 26:39.434
I'm one of his associates.

26:41.913 --> 26:43.613
Well, Mr. Associate, I didn't free-fall

26:43.648 --> 26:46.558
into an occupied bloc just
to end up in a dark cell.

26:46.583 --> 26:50.308
So if we're gonna meet,
it's gonna be on my terms.

26:50.989 --> 26:52.722
Tell me what you wanna do.

27:10.979 --> 27:12.565
Hey.

27:13.596 --> 27:15.211
It's okay.

27:15.247 --> 27:17.910
Mom and Dad'll be home soon.

27:19.809 --> 27:21.985
I think Lindsey's dead.

27:24.155 --> 27:26.020
Your tutor?

27:37.035 --> 27:38.434
Um...

27:38.470 --> 27:39.896
look...

27:40.438 --> 27:42.630
Lindsey wasn't your friend.

27:43.466 --> 27:45.875
She was trying to brainwash you.

27:50.115 --> 27:53.550
I thought it would be better
when we were all back together.

27:54.953 --> 27:57.520
But I miss our old house.

27:57.556 --> 27:59.566
I miss Minny.

28:00.620 --> 28:03.721
I just want things to be
back the way they were.

28:09.128 --> 28:10.900
Me too.

28:15.311 --> 28:16.577
What's going on?

28:24.792 --> 28:26.589
Get up there.

28:54.913 --> 28:56.981
Take me through the plan.

28:57.358 --> 28:58.957
I'll walk through the park.

28:59.029 --> 29:01.014
The pilot will know to
establish contact with me

29:01.039 --> 29:02.839
because I'm carrying this book.

29:02.864 --> 29:04.350
When the pilot approaches,

29:04.375 --> 29:06.568
I will confirm her identity
and then drop the book.

29:06.593 --> 29:08.645
That'll be your signal to take her.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.046
No funny business.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.215
We have agents crawling
all over that park.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.616
Then you're doing it wrong.

29:13.652 --> 29:15.034
If she smells something, she's gone.

29:15.059 --> 29:17.192
They're professionals.
She won't see anything.

29:17.255 --> 29:20.761
Really? 'Cause I sniffed out
your coverage in ten seconds.

29:21.275 --> 29:24.464
Cut the number of agents in
half unless you wanna blow this.

29:27.032 --> 29:29.332
Fine. But if you don't bring her in...

29:29.368 --> 29:31.001
I will.

29:31.036 --> 29:32.409
I wanna talk to my kids first.

29:32.434 --> 29:34.089
I need to know they're safe.

29:42.247 --> 29:44.914
Put me through to the team
holding the Bowman children.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.190
All units: shots fired.

29:47.215 --> 29:49.386
Multiple officers down.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.833
- What's going on with my kids?
- We're gonna miss our window.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.684
We have to wait to get a
report from that apartment.

29:53.709 --> 29:55.809
- I need that pilot.
- I'm not putting him out there

29:55.834 --> 29:57.286
unless I know we have some leverage.

29:57.311 --> 29:59.247
It is not your call.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.732
We have a sniper on you.

30:02.768 --> 30:04.439
I got it.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.743
Ice-cold drinks here!

30:13.779 --> 30:16.492
Get your ice-cold drinks!

30:16.815 --> 30:20.350
Copy. Reported two
female, possibly armed.

30:20.385 --> 30:21.618
Proceed with caution.

30:50.492 --> 30:53.293
Sir, our team just cleared
the apartment building.

30:53.374 --> 30:55.535
The Bowman children are gone.

30:56.106 --> 30:58.221
Do we have any description
of the attackers?

30:58.256 --> 31:00.323
Yes, the descriptions match Katie Bowman

31:00.358 --> 31:02.410
and Eric Broussard.

31:04.463 --> 31:07.330
Be advised. Katie
Bowman and Eric Broussard

31:07.365 --> 31:09.432
have abducted the Bowman children.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.413
We need to abort this mission now.

31:11.438 --> 31:14.448
Negative. Our objective
remains the same.

31:20.740 --> 31:22.479
Hey, man, Take a soda.

31:22.514 --> 31:23.913
$10.

31:23.949 --> 31:26.249
I'm shutting this shitshow down.

31:26.284 --> 31:28.724
Why are you pulling out now?

31:29.552 --> 31:31.693
Something changed.

31:32.701 --> 31:35.625
- You lost your leverage.
- Get to the van.

31:35.660 --> 31:37.240
Now!

31:45.049 --> 31:46.369
Somebody stop him.

31:52.035 --> 31:53.610
Freeze!

32:07.815 --> 32:09.048
Freeze!

32:35.244 --> 32:36.744
Shit!

32:37.170 --> 32:39.094
On your knees!

32:43.709 --> 32:45.054
Uhh!

32:52.722 --> 32:54.299
Are you the pilot?

32:54.324 --> 32:55.672
Who the hell are you?

32:55.707 --> 32:58.174
I'm with Broussard. The
Occupation captured me

32:58.210 --> 33:00.009
and forced me to make that radio call.

33:00.045 --> 33:01.244
I figured you were working with them

33:01.279 --> 33:02.917
when I saw the surveillance.

33:03.027 --> 33:04.881
Did you see me stab that guy?

33:04.916 --> 33:07.120
That's why you're still talking.

33:09.487 --> 33:11.050
Let's go... move!

33:35.234 --> 33:37.264
Where are we?

33:37.757 --> 33:39.590
We're in the sewers, love.

33:40.266 --> 33:43.085
How is Dad going to find us?

33:43.936 --> 33:46.319
Well, Dad's really
good at finding things.

33:46.344 --> 33:49.600
He... he found Charlie
in Santa Monica, right?

33:55.312 --> 33:57.624
Hey, guys, listen...

33:57.848 --> 34:00.952
what happened at that apartment...

34:03.530 --> 34:05.867
I was just trying to keep you all safe.

34:06.957 --> 34:08.623
Do you understand?

34:08.914 --> 34:10.158
Yeah.

34:10.193 --> 34:11.759
We know.

34:17.306 --> 34:19.107
Broussard lives here?

34:20.136 --> 34:22.161
It's a good place to hide.

34:22.478 --> 34:24.244
For how long?

34:26.543 --> 34:28.309
Until things change.

34:28.344 --> 34:29.844
Why'd the Redhats come for us?

34:29.880 --> 34:31.701
What'd Dad do?

34:36.953 --> 34:39.092
Your father was helping me...

34:39.485 --> 34:41.013
figure out...

34:41.750 --> 34:43.301
what's really going on in this bloc

34:43.326 --> 34:46.451
so that we can decide if this
family's gonna stay or go.

34:47.076 --> 34:48.763
You wanna run?

34:49.050 --> 34:50.416
I thought you were in the Resistance.

34:50.440 --> 34:51.940
Not now, Bram.

34:53.657 --> 34:55.935
What's really going on with Dad?

35:00.677 --> 35:02.510
Keep moving.

35:18.228 --> 35:20.862
So I hear that the operation
to capture the pilot

35:20.897 --> 35:22.730
was a complete disaster.

35:22.766 --> 35:25.633
Yes. But we were able to eliminate

35:25.669 --> 35:27.479
a key mole at Homeland.

35:27.706 --> 35:30.252
Because he escaped with the pilot.

35:30.682 --> 35:33.485
Your relentless focus on the negative

35:33.510 --> 35:35.393
isn't productive.

35:36.198 --> 35:39.573
I'm achieving some
real gains in my bloc.

35:40.183 --> 35:42.488
By what metrics, exactly?

35:42.513 --> 35:44.738
Growth of the Greatest Day,

35:44.763 --> 35:48.021
expansion of our security apparatus...

35:48.372 --> 35:50.258
our youth.

35:50.646 --> 35:52.849
None of that matters.

35:52.965 --> 35:56.667
You came to me with a
plan to fix the bloc,

35:56.753 --> 35:58.433
and you have failed.

35:58.468 --> 36:00.234
I'm not the one who went to the IGA

36:00.270 --> 36:02.885
and made promises I couldn't keep.

36:02.910 --> 36:04.135
I made those promises

36:04.160 --> 36:06.551
because I misplaced my trust in you.

36:06.576 --> 36:08.464
Ah...

36:08.971 --> 36:11.065
Are you gonna tell them that?

36:11.748 --> 36:14.949
Helena, you can't fire me.

36:14.985 --> 36:18.081
Not after you swore
that I was your savior.

36:18.388 --> 36:20.487
It'll blow back on you.

36:22.993 --> 36:24.559
I'm going to...

36:24.594 --> 36:26.561
transfer some key personnel

36:26.596 --> 36:29.630
from the San Fernando
bloc to Los Angeles,

36:29.666 --> 36:31.982
and I expect your full cooperation.

36:32.007 --> 36:33.606
Here's the list.

36:36.314 --> 36:37.509
No.

36:38.308 --> 36:40.141
I believe in my people...

36:40.176 --> 36:42.210
and my approach,

36:42.245 --> 36:45.046
and I will not be undermined.

36:52.322 --> 36:53.672
Very well.

36:57.252 --> 36:58.867
That's all.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.404
Get me Alan Snyder.

37:50.046 --> 37:51.779
Shh, shh, shh!

38:03.815 --> 38:05.026
Dad!

38:42.590 --> 38:44.390
Thank you.

38:55.353 --> 38:57.887
I made contact with the pilot.

38:58.550 --> 39:00.548
She wants to meet you at a neutral site.

39:00.823 --> 39:02.950
Why didn't she come here with you?

39:02.986 --> 39:04.919
'Cause I almost walked
her into an ambush.

39:04.954 --> 39:06.654
Has to be her way.

39:09.759 --> 39:10.892
Okay.

39:20.137 --> 39:21.595
Turn around!

39:34.329 --> 39:36.484
I've come a long way to meet you.

39:36.519 --> 39:39.532
I hear you have a piece
of alien technology.

39:39.689 --> 39:42.123
Depends. Who's asking?

39:42.158 --> 39:43.658
I represent a resistance group

39:43.693 --> 39:45.868
based outside the Colony.

39:47.735 --> 39:49.330
How do we know that's even true?

39:49.365 --> 39:51.632
You took part in an
operation that went bad

39:51.668 --> 39:54.068
outside Herat in 2010.

39:54.103 --> 39:55.503
The official version was

39:55.538 --> 39:57.772
that you responded to enemy sniper fire,

39:57.797 --> 40:00.586
but in reality, one
of your men fired first

40:00.611 --> 40:03.272
after mistaking a bag
of books for an IED.

40:03.297 --> 40:06.314
Now, only five men on
Earth knew this story.

40:06.349 --> 40:09.945
Three of them are dead. I
work for the other survivor.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.087
He has a tattoo on his right arm.

40:13.122 --> 40:16.406
Bugs Bunny holding a stick of dynamite.

40:26.612 --> 40:28.178
My name is Noa.

40:28.203 --> 40:30.297
Why did you come here?

40:30.868 --> 40:33.164
Is it because of the attack on the RAP?

40:33.641 --> 40:35.176
I'm here...

40:35.211 --> 40:37.778
because the real war is about to begin.

40:40.750 --> 40:42.735
And that thing you stole...

40:43.686 --> 40:45.453
it's gonna help us win it.

40:48.586 --> 40:49.828
