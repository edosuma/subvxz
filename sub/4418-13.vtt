BE HERE ANY MINUTE

00:39.070 --> 00:40.970
AND CARTMAN DIDN'T
SHOW UP FOR SCHOOL.

00:40.972 --> 00:42.972
YEAH THIS IS
THE THIRD DAY IN A ROW.

00:42.974 --> 00:44.340
I WONDER
WHAT'S WRONG.

00:44.342 --> 00:45.775
( mumbling )

00:45.777 --> 00:46.843
( laughing )

00:46.845 --> 00:47.277
YEAH!

00:47.279 --> 00:51.147
MAYBE WE SHOULD DITCH SCHOOL
AND CHECK ON HIM.

00:51.216 --> 00:52.549
C'MON,
WE'RE RUNNING LATE!

00:52.551 --> 00:54.617
WE'RE NOT GETTING ON,
YOU FAT UGLY BITCH.

00:54.619 --> 00:55.852
WHAT DID
YOU SAY?!

00:55.854 --> 00:58.822
I SAID "WE'RE NOT GETTING ON,
YOU FAT UGLY BITCH."

00:58.824 --> 01:01.524
OH, ALRIGHT
THEN.

01:01.927 --> 01:03.259
WHOA, DUDE!

01:03.261 --> 01:06.095
I ALWAYS WONDERED
IF THAT WOULD WORK.

01:07.032 --> 01:07.664
( doorbell )

01:07.666 --> 01:08.531
HELLO,
BOYS.

01:08.533 --> 01:11.401
HI, WE WERE WONDERING
WHY FAT ASS--
I MEAN CARTMAN,

01:11.403 --> 01:12.469
HASN'T BEEN SHOWING
UP FOR SCHOOL.

01:12.471 --> 01:14.904
OH, HE'S JUST BEEN FEELING
UNDER THE WEATHER.

01:14.906 --> 01:17.273
MAYBE YOU BOYS
CAN CHEER HIM UP.

01:17.275 --> 01:18.708
HE'S IN
THE BACKYARD.

01:18.710 --> 01:20.710
IN THE BACKYARD?

01:20.712 --> 01:23.279
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME MORE TEA,
POLLY PRISSYPANTS?

01:23.281 --> 01:26.716

01:26.718 --> 01:29.886

( Polly )
YOU ARE SO
STRONG AND SMART

01:41.766 --> 01:43.132

01:50.141 --> 01:51.941
C'MON, LET'S GO
MAKE FUN OF HIM.

01:51.943 --> 01:54.077
NO DUDE, THIS LOOKS
REALLY SERIOUS.

01:54.079 --> 01:55.879
I THINK
WE BETTER GET HELP.

01:55.881 --> 01:56.846
REALLY?

01:57.082 --> 02:00.049
( Panda )
ERIC, YOU ARE THE
COOLEST GUY IN THE WORLD.

02:00.051 --> 02:01.851
THIS IS
TREMENDOUS TEA.

02:01.853 --> 02:03.686
WHY THANK YOU
PETER PANDA.

02:03.688 --> 02:06.055
IT'S A DISTINCTIVE
EARL GRAY.

02:06.057 --> 02:07.657
ERIC IS THE BEST.

02:07.659 --> 02:08.992
HURRAY FOR ERIC!

02:08.994 --> 02:10.994
ERIC KICKS ASS.

02:10.996 --> 02:11.594
MR. MACKY,

02:11.596 --> 02:13.396
SOMETHING'S REALLY
WRONG WITH CARTMAN.

02:13.398 --> 02:15.265
OH, WELL,
THERE'S A NEWS FLASH.

02:15.267 --> 02:18.201
WE SAW HIM HAVING A TEA PARTY
WITH HIS STUFFED ANIMALS.

02:18.203 --> 02:21.671
YEAH, HE WAS DOING THEIR VOICES
AND POURING TEA FOR THEM.

02:21.673 --> 02:22.472
OH OKAY.

02:22.474 --> 02:23.973
ERIC IS OBVIOUSLY
SUFFERING

02:23.975 --> 02:27.644
FROM SOME KIND
OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS.

02:27.646 --> 02:28.545
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN?

02:28.547 --> 02:30.747
HAVE YOU BOYS NOTICED
ANYTHING RECENTLY

02:30.749 --> 02:32.215
THAT TROUBLED ERIC?

02:32.217 --> 02:32.582
NO.

02:32.584 --> 02:36.219
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING
IS BOTHERING HIM, OKAY?

02:36.221 --> 02:37.854
OH, OF COURSE!

02:37.856 --> 02:39.556
MY VIDEO CAMERA!

02:39.558 --> 02:42.325
BOYS IF YOU COULD
VIDEOTAPE ERIC'S BEHAVIOR,

02:42.327 --> 02:45.328
THEN I CAN STUDY HIM
PSYCHOLOGICALLY

02:45.330 --> 02:47.797
AND FIND OUT
WHAT'S WRONG, OKAY?

02:47.799 --> 02:48.965
IS THAT LEGAL?

02:48.967 --> 02:50.500
OH, HELL YES.

02:50.502 --> 02:51.367
MY GOODNESS,

02:51.369 --> 02:54.237

03:06.284 --> 03:08.885
DUDE, THIS IS GONNA BE
THE FUNNIEST TAPE EVER MADE.

03:08.887 --> 03:10.653
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK
MR. MACKY NEEDS?

03:10.655 --> 03:12.655
I DON'T KNOW,
JUST KEEP ROLLING.

03:12.657 --> 03:14.090

03:39.317 --> 03:42.585
MOM, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

I WANT TO KNOW
WHERE I CAME FROM!

04:08.546 --> 04:09.078
OH.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.581
HMM, WELL,
YOU SEE, ERIC,

04:11.583 --> 04:13.650
SOMETIMES WHEN
A MAN AND A WOMAN

04:13.652 --> 04:15.652
ARE ATTRACTED
TO EACH OTHER,

04:15.654 --> 04:19.422
THEY WANT TO BE
CLOSE TO EACH OTHER.

04:19.424 --> 04:19.989
UH-HUH.

04:19.991 --> 04:23.726
AND SOMETIMES THE MAN
PUTS HIS<i> HOO-HOO-DILLY</i>

04:23.728 --> 04:26.596
IN THE WOMAN'S
<i>CHA-CHA.</i>

04:31.369 --> 04:34.637
SO WHO PUT HIS HOO-HOO-DILLY
IN YOUR CHA-CHA?

04:34.639 --> 04:36.939
ERIC, THE DAY
I MET YOUR FATHER

04:36.941 --> 04:38.608
IT WAS LIKE MAGIC.

04:38.610 --> 04:40.877
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL
AUTUMN NIGHT

04:40.879 --> 04:43.513
WHEN THE ASPEN TREES
WERE TURNING,

04:43.515 --> 04:47.283
AT THE 12th ANNUAL
DRUNKEN BARN DANCE.

04:51.022 --> 04:54.524
( Mrs. Cartman )
I WAS YOUNG
AND NAIVE THEN.

04:54.526 --> 04:57.393
WOW, I'VE NEVER SEEN A WOMAN
DRINK THAT MUCH.

04:57.395 --> 04:58.861
YOU'RE AMAZING,
MISS CARTMAN!

04:58.863 --> 05:01.698
OH, HECK, I HAVEN'T
EVEN STARTED YET.

05:01.700 --> 05:05.635
I BAKED COOKIES,
WOULD ANYBODY LIKE ONE?

05:05.637 --> 05:07.603
I WOULDN'T MIND
GETTING AHOLD

05:07.605 --> 05:09.539
OF<i> YOUR</i> COOKIES,
MISS CARTMAN.

05:09.541 --> 05:14.277
WELL, GOIGHT AHEAD,
OFFICER BARBRADY.

05:15.046 --> 05:17.747
MMM, THAT'S

C'MON,

LET'S DO THE
DRUNKEN BARN DANCE!

05:31.129 --> 05:34.263
( Mrs. Cartman )
AND THEN I SAW HIM.

05:34.265 --> 05:36.132
HE WAS THE
MOST BEAUTIFUL,

05:36.134 --> 05:40.002
CHARMING PIECE OF ASS
I'D EVER SEEN IN SOUTH PARK.

05:40.004 --> 05:43.973
HIS NAME WAS
CHIEF RUNNING WATER.

05:57.021 --> 06:00.490
I DON'T RECALL EXACTLY
HOW THE REST OF THE NIGHT WENT.

06:00.492 --> 06:03.960
BUT THE NEXT MORNING
I WAS PREGNANT WITH<i> YOU,</i>

06:03.962 --> 06:06.195
MY LITTLE
BLUEBERRY MUFFIN.

06:06.197 --> 06:09.766
SO WHERE IS CHIEF RUNNING--
I MEAN DAD, NOW?

06:09.768 --> 06:11.400
I NEVER SAW HIM
AFTER THAT.

06:11.402 --> 06:13.703
I WASN'T REALLY
THAT INTERESTED IN HIM.

06:13.705 --> 06:16.706
THAT ISN'T A VERY
ROMANTIC STORY, MOM!

06:16.708 --> 06:19.542
I HEARD HE STILL LIVES
ON THE UTE RESERVATION

06:19.544 --> 06:21.277
JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN.

06:21.279 --> 06:26.048
TO THINK ALL THIS TIME,
I'M ACTUALLY A NAIVE AMERICAN.

06:26.050 --> 06:26.549
MEOW.

06:26.551 --> 06:29.085

06:46.704 --> 06:48.171

kidnapped daughter.

06:48.173 --> 06:50.540
Then I'm going to go
with you, Terrance.

06:50.542 --> 06:52.074
( farting )

06:52.076 --> 06:54.610

07:12.397 --> 07:14.530
Here is your host,
Bob Saget!

07:14.532 --> 07:18.768
I just flew into the studio,
boy are my arms tired.

07:18.770 --> 07:19.869
( laughing )

07:19.871 --> 07:22.605
Why didn't the skeleton
cross the road?

07:22.607 --> 07:25.208
'Cause he didn't
have the guts.

07:25.210 --> 07:26.475
Knock, knock.

07:27.412 --> 07:28.144

07:37.989 --> 07:42.491
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
DRESSED UP LIKE AN INDIAN
WITH A BEAR NECKLACE?

07:42.493 --> 07:43.893
NAIVE AMERICAN, STAN.

07:43.895 --> 07:46.462

IMPORTANT TO MY PEOPLE.

07:46.464 --> 07:47.496
WHAT?

07:47.498 --> 07:47.997
( laughing )

07:47.999 --> 07:50.766

07:56.608 --> 07:58.007
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, CARTMAN?

07:58.009 --> 08:00.743
MY NAME ISN'T ERIC CARTMAN,
IT'S ERIC<i> RUNNING WATER.</i>

08:00.745 --> 08:01.577
CAN I BORROW YOUR BIKE,

08:01.579 --> 08:03.880
OR DO I HAVE TO KICK YOU
IN THE NUTS AND STEAL IT?

08:03.882 --> 08:05.615
GO AHEAD
DUDE.

08:05.617 --> 08:07.316

08:14.859 --> 08:17.960

08:17.962 --> 08:20.263
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS!
HOLY SMOKES!

08:20.265 --> 08:23.599

08:29.374 --> 08:30.940
AND BEAR
CRIED TO EAGLE--

08:30.942 --> 08:34.277
RUNNING WATER, THERE IS
SOME KID HERE TO SEE YOU.

08:34.279 --> 08:34.977
WHAT KID?

08:34.979 --> 08:36.913
HE CLAIMS TO BE
<i>YOUR</i> KID.

08:36.915 --> 08:37.747
HI, DAD!

08:37.749 --> 08:38.848
WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU?

08:38.850 --> 08:39.582
I'M YOUR SON, ERIC.

08:39.584 --> 08:42.551
MY MOM SAYS YOU PUT YOUR
HOO-HOO-DILLY IN HER CHA-CHA

08:42.553 --> 08:44.120
AT THE DRUNKEN
BARN DANCE.

08:44.122 --> 08:45.154
YOUR MOTHER?

08:45.156 --> 08:46.355
DIANE CARTMAN.

08:46.357 --> 08:46.889
CARTMAN?!

08:46.891 --> 08:49.325
I WAS WORRIED THERE
FOR A SECOND.

08:49.327 --> 08:51.794
LOOK KID,
I'M NOT YOUR FATHER.

08:51.796 --> 08:53.996
MY MOM SAYS YOU'RE
THE GUY SHE WAS WITH.

08:53.998 --> 08:55.865
KID, I HATE TO
BREAK THIS TO YOU,

08:55.867 --> 08:58.768
BUT YOUR MOTHER IS WHAT WE
NATIVE AMERICANS REFER TO AS

08:58.770 --> 09:00.903
"BEAR WITH
WIDE CANYON".

09:00.905 --> 09:01.704
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN?

09:01.706 --> 09:05.041
SHE IS "DOE WHO CANNOT
KEEP LEGS TOGETHER".

09:05.043 --> 09:05.675
HUH?

09:05.677 --> 09:07.343
YOUR MOM'S
A SLUT.

09:07.345 --> 09:07.810
HEY!

09:07.812 --> 09:08.511
DON'T FEEL
TOO BAD.

09:08.513 --> 09:11.447

18:38.716 --> 18:41.850
Our judges have narrowed
it down to only three videos.

18:41.852 --> 18:45.187
First it's "Dog Who Puts
Hat On Master's Head".

18:45.189 --> 18:47.656
"Oh, I'm a little dog,
I'm just a little dog.

18:47.658 --> 18:52.594
I've got to put a hat
on my master's head."

18:53.097 --> 18:54.363
( laughing )

18:54.999 --> 18:56.632
And now our
second finalist,

18:56.634 --> 18:58.467
"Little Boy Has
A Tea Party".

18:58.469 --> 19:00.802
Why thank you
Polly Prissypants.

19:00.804 --> 19:02.437
You are
my best friend.

19:02.439 --> 19:03.939
( Polly )
Thank you, Eric.

19:03.941 --> 19:07.809
Boy, looks like this kid
needs some therapy.

19:07.811 --> 19:09.645
WE'RE SURE TO WIN
CARTMAN.

19:09.647 --> 19:11.813
THEN YOU GET
YOUR DNA MONEY.

19:11.815 --> 19:13.315
I-AM

19:13.317 --> 19:15.584
SO-PISSED-OFF

19:15.586 --> 19:16.919
RIGHT-NOW.

19:16.921 --> 19:18.921
THEY LAUGHED HARDEST
AT OUR VIDEO.

19:18.923 --> 19:20.289
WE'RE GONNA WIN,
WE'RE GONNA WIN!

19:20.291 --> 19:22.257
And finally
our third contestant,

19:22.259 --> 19:24.026
"Young Child Gets
Hit By A Train".

19:24.028 --> 19:25.527
"Oh, I'm such
a cute little kid.

19:25.529 --> 19:29.665
"I wonder if I can get
this go-kart started.

19:35.372 --> 19:38.173
"I hope I don't
get hit by a train!

19:38.175 --> 19:39.508
Oh, I sure did!"

19:39.510 --> 19:40.175
( laughing )

19:40.177 --> 19:43.378
OH, MY GOD, THEY VIDEOTAPED
KILLING KE!

19:43.380 --> 19:44.479
YOU BASTARDS!

19:44.481 --> 19:46.715
Now that's what
I call a joyride.

19:46.717 --> 19:49.618
And the winner is,
naturally,

19:49.620 --> 19:52.421
"Little Boy
Being Hit By A Train".

19:52.423 --> 19:53.589
( laughing )

19:53.591 --> 19:55.457
DUDE, WE LOST!

19:55.459 --> 19:56.291
DAMNIT!

19:56.293 --> 19:58.393

YOU-GUYS!

20:01.131 --> 20:01.897

20:01.899 --> 20:04.032
Stand up and take a bow,
Mr. Marsh.

20:04.034 --> 20:05.701
I won, I won!

20:05.703 --> 20:06.301
GRANDPA!

20:06.303 --> 20:08.303
Our other finalists
will have to settle

20:08.305 --> 20:10.372
for their $3,000
runner-up prizes.

20:10.374 --> 20:11.840
See you
next time.

20:11.842 --> 20:13.475
DID YOU
HEAR THAT DUDE?

20:13.477 --> 20:15.644
WE STILL GET
$3,000.

20:15.646 --> 20:18.080
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR YOU
TO DO YOUR DNA TEST.

20:18.082 --> 20:19.514
KILL-YOU-GUYS.

20:19.516 --> 20:22.417
KILL-YOU-GUYS!

20:24.755 --> 20:26.688

EVERYONE'S ACCOUNTS,

GET ON WITH IT!

20:52.950 --> 20:53.582
( mumbling )

20:53.584 --> 20:56.918
THE FATHER OF
ERIC CARTMAN IS INDEED

20:56.920 --> 20:58.620
SOMEONE
IN THIS ROOM.

20:58.622 --> 21:00.288
THE FATHER IS...

21:00.290 --> 21:02.391
WHO IS
ERIC CARTMAN'S FATHER?

21:02.393 --> 21:04.626

21:09.933 --> 21:11.867
OR IS IT

21:11.869 --> 21:13.001
NO, HE'S GAY!

21:13.003 --> 21:13.869

21:21.879 --> 21:22.577
COULD BE.

21:22.579 --> 21:24.179
OR MR. BROVLOFSKI?

21:24.181 --> 21:25.614
DAD, HOW

21:25.616 --> 21:29.184
