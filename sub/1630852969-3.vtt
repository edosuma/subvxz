00:04.938 --> 00:06.471
JASON: Here we go!
Here we go!

00:06.474 --> 00:09.475
DAVE: Damn! MANNY:
Whoo! BOB: Big boy.

00:10.477 --> 00:12.244
<i>NARRATOR: The battle for
bluefin is heating up...</i>

00:12.263 --> 00:14.813

NICHOLAS: Woo! Tail rope!

00:14.815 --> 00:16.882
<i>NARRATOR: And making waves...</i>

<i>NARRATOR: But in a competition
filled with champions...</i>

00:24.024 --> 00:25.557
DAVE: Coming after you guys.

00:25.559 --> 00:26.558
Woo!

00:26.627 --> 00:28.027
<i>NARRATOR:
And would be kings...</i>

00:28.095 --> 00:29.495
JACK: Slight reverse!

00:29.563 --> 00:31.430
<i>NARRATOR: Only one
boat can win it all.</i>

00:31.432 --> 00:33.899
PAUL: Come on, Doug.
Let's get our first fish.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.768
JASON: Here we go!
Here we go! Oh!

00:36.570 --> 00:39.171
MANNY: Oh!
It's a real one, boys.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.774
<i>NARRATOR: While some captains
are chasing a dynasty...</i>

00:41.842 --> 00:43.708
MARCIANO: I'm feeling good.
I'm feeling good.

00:43.711 --> 00:44.910
<i>NARRATOR: Others
are on a mission...</i>

00:44.978 --> 00:46.245
MANNY: Yup. Coming.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.513
<i>NARRATOR: To claim the
crown for the first time...</i>

00:48.516 --> 00:50.248
VAUGHNS: I think
we just hooked up.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.184
JACK: Just keep him tight, Nick.
NICHOLAS: Yes, sir.

00:52.252 --> 00:53.852
MARISSA: Are they coming
to show us their fish?

00:53.921 --> 00:54.920
<i>NARRATOR: On...</i>

00:54.922 --> 00:56.188
MANNY: Pull it in.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.989
<i>NARRATOR: Wicked Tuna.</i>

00:57.992 --> 00:59.191
MARCIANO: All right, guys.

00:59.259 --> 01:01.410
Let's go back to
our winning position.

01:03.263 --> 01:05.464
<i>NARRATOR: Pinwheel clings

01:14.141 --> 01:16.475
<i>While Wicked Pissah and

01:16.543 --> 01:17.793
<i>their first fish.</i>

01:27.621 --> 01:30.288
MARCIANO: High tide
slack right now, boys.

01:30.491 --> 01:31.823
Primetime.

01:31.826 --> 01:33.625
JASON: See ya little squid.

01:35.229 --> 01:39.131
This current out here,
this weight holds my bait.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.201
Holds it down to
where I want it.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.971
JOE: Stick with 16 and
12 ounces of weight.

01:45.973 --> 01:49.174
The balloon kind of allows
us to spread out our bait.

01:49.176 --> 01:51.643
Just like bass fishermen
fishing in a lake, right?

01:52.045 --> 01:54.246
Same concept just on a
bigger scale, you know.

01:54.248 --> 01:56.515
So Jay's gonna get that
bait down to depth.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.518
I'm gonna put the balloon on it
and we're gonna float it out there,

01:59.520 --> 02:01.653
so everything's not
fishing on your anchor,

02:01.722 --> 02:03.455
so you get your
lines spread out.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.858
Everything's gonna be
at a nice equal spread.

02:07.394 --> 02:09.528
MARCIANO: You and Jay
sure do make a great team.

02:09.530 --> 02:12.597
It's early in the season,
but we're off to a great start.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.933
Last season, we
caught a lot of fish and

02:15.002 --> 02:16.801
came in second place.

02:16.804 --> 02:17.936
Awesome! Good job!

02:17.938 --> 02:19.404
JOE: Yeah!

02:19.473 --> 02:23.008
MARCIANO: But this year, we
wanna be that top boat again.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.145
JOE: It's gonna happen.
It's gonna happen.

02:27.214 --> 02:29.548
MARCIANO: We're fishing on
one of my favorite spots on

02:29.550 --> 02:30.882
Stellwagen Bank.

02:30.885 --> 02:33.886
I don't know what the rest of
the fleet is doing and frankly,

02:34.955 --> 02:36.221
I don't care.

02:36.757 --> 02:40.125
We're just staying radio silent
and fishing by ourselves.

02:41.779 --> 02:43.762
JOE: When are they coming?
JASON: When are they coming?

02:43.830 --> 02:45.430
MARCIANO: Any minute now
this place is gonna...

02:45.499 --> 02:47.432
ALL: Bust wide open.

02:53.107 --> 02:55.641
PAUL: Check this down
line and see how it's doing.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.510
See all the slime?

02:58.512 --> 03:01.046
The slime on the line.

03:01.849 --> 03:05.751
Last year, we won it for
the first time in ten years,

03:06.854 --> 03:09.120
so going from first to
worst at the beginning of the

03:09.123 --> 03:11.923
season is a setback.

03:11.926 --> 03:13.992
It's nerve-racking.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.261
Slime is ferocious.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.863
Even though I'm saving
money having one mate,

03:18.866 --> 03:22.134
there's a lot of stress going
into the season with a new boat.

03:22.202 --> 03:26.738
I could really use a diamond
tuna to get me out of the red.

03:27.408 --> 03:30.475
Every detail matters right now.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.678
See, the fish see this.

03:34.014 --> 03:37.216
When you got big bends,
and kinks, and (bleep).

03:37.284 --> 03:40.152
They see all that.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.087
Especially when the sun
goes into the water and it

03:42.089 --> 03:44.156
reflects on the line.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.157
Sees every imperfection.

03:46.827 --> 03:49.160
I'm also going back to
the playbook that made us

03:49.163 --> 03:51.296
the top boat last season.

03:51.365 --> 03:55.433
I mean, being patient and
fishing in my backyard is what

03:55.436 --> 03:57.035
won for us last year.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.037
That's how we won.

03:59.106 --> 04:01.306
So we're down
south of Gloucester.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.109
A lot of guys are up
north of Gloucester.

04:04.645 --> 04:07.712
Hopefully, that and the
attention to detail will help

04:07.715 --> 04:10.982
us get a bite and turn
the season around for us.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.985
To have that target
on your back is tough.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.921
I make sure
everything's perfect.

04:16.790 --> 04:20.092
It separates people who
catch 'em and people who don't.

04:21.395 --> 04:22.927
We're gonna go tight, Doug.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.429
DOUG: Yeah.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.606
(beeping)

04:34.675 --> 04:37.009
PAUL: Ah. Nice mark.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.912
Look at them. Two of them.
Another one. Three of them.

04:41.548 --> 04:42.814
(beeping)

04:42.816 --> 04:43.882
(reel clicking)

04:43.950 --> 04:45.483
(reel unspooling rapidly).

04:45.486 --> 04:49.521
Here we go. We're on!
Got 'em. Come on, Doug.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.690
Let's get our first fish.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.692
DOUG: He's acting like a short.

04:53.694 --> 04:58.280
PAUL: Come on. DOUG:
Oh, be a 73. PAUL: Right?

05:02.569 --> 05:05.770
Got some weight on him, huh?
What do you think?

05:06.039 --> 05:11.176
DOUG: I don't know.
Might be. Might just be.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.012
PAUL: I like when
Dougie's happy like that.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.049
DOUG: He's got a
little bit of balls on him.

05:18.052 --> 05:20.785
PAUL: Yeah.
DOUG: He's a little wild.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.755
I see him coming right up.
73 come up.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.795
Wanna bring him in?

05:30.798 --> 05:31.996
PAUL: No. He's not a keeper.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.598
DOUG: He's not?
PAUL: No, he's not a keeper.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.133
DOUG: Okay.
PAUL: Loosen the drag.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.668
DOUG: Wanna measure him or no?
PAUL: Take the hook out.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.736
No, he's not.

05:37.804 --> 05:41.272
I am 100% all
about conservation.

05:41.275 --> 05:44.943
If this fish is remotely
close to 73 inches,

05:44.945 --> 05:47.612
I will let this tuna
go without measuring.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.814
Just a little bit under.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.951
It still sucks to know we
haven't caught our first tuna.

05:53.019 --> 05:56.488
Of course, I wanna keep that
title but it is nothing more

05:56.490 --> 05:59.824
important to me than
making sure the species of

05:59.827 --> 06:03.561
giant bluefin tuna is
around for a lot of years.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.431
That was a nice
little 72-inch fish.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.433
DOUG: Close, but no cigar.

06:08.619 --> 06:12.370
PAUL: Yeah, we're practicing.
Don't worry, Dougie.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.773
We're gonna get
our first one soon.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.379
(barking)

06:21.581 --> 06:23.314
TJ: Tell me when
you're ready, Jarrett.

06:23.317 --> 06:24.849
JARRETT: In the mornings,
I like to go through.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.117
Check out all the harpoons.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.386
Make sure
they're all ready to go,

06:27.454 --> 06:29.321
so if we do hook up,
everything's ready to rock.

06:29.856 --> 06:31.790
Like right now,
you can see this one.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.326
You can see how the saltwater
corroded it right on there.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.796
This tip is supposed to come
off of this shaft right here.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.397
But right now, it's stuck.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.600
TJ: Jarrett returned last night
so this is Jarrett's kind of

06:41.668 --> 06:43.735
maiden voyage for the season.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.004
He missed the first couple of
trips because of a baby shower.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.405
He's got a little
one on the way.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.607
JARRETT: It's kind of sticking,

06:48.675 --> 06:50.475
so we gotta clean it up
a little bit.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.076
TJ: Just getting out to where
we've been fishing off the cape

06:52.079 --> 06:55.213
about 15 miles east of
Chatham and unfortunately

06:55.215 --> 06:57.081
so far this season,
we're just hemorrhaging money.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.218
JARRETT: Just grinding
that crap off of there.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.352
TJ: Right now, us,

07:01.355 --> 07:03.288
the Tuna. Com
and the Wicked Pissah

07:03.356 --> 07:04.422
are the bottom three boats.

07:04.425 --> 07:05.890
We've all won in
previous seasons,

07:05.893 --> 07:07.492
so it's definitely shocking
that the three of us would be

07:07.494 --> 07:08.626
at the bottom of
the leaderboard.

07:08.629 --> 07:09.761
JARRETT: And there you go.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.863
TJ: Hopefully with Jarrett
back, we can turn things around.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.233
MIKE: How'd your party turn out?

07:15.302 --> 07:16.435
JARRETT: It turned
out really good, man.

07:16.503 --> 07:17.769
Had about, you know,

07:17.838 --> 07:19.037
a good like 70 people
show up, so.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.306
MIKE: Nice.
TJ: Did you do a gender reveal?

07:21.308 --> 07:22.374
JARRETT: We did.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.843
We popped a big balloon
with blue confetti in it.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.378
MIKE: Oh!
JARRETT: Yeah.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.247
ALL: Woo! Yeah!

07:29.516 --> 07:32.250
JARRETT: It's a baby boy.
MIKE: Baby Hunter.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.785
JARRETT: Just nice to get
back here and get on the boat

07:33.854 --> 07:35.787
and start trying to catch
fish and make some money.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.789
I got another mouth to
feed coming here soon,

07:37.858 --> 07:41.126
so we got to catch
about ten times more fish

07:41.194 --> 07:42.994
than we normally do.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.597
TJ: The fact that the Hot Tuna
is a family business means that

07:45.665 --> 07:48.132
there are a bunch of people
looking for a paycheck.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.134
So it's imperative that I
get the boat out there and

07:50.137 --> 07:51.336
put us on the fish.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.938
And now that Jarrett's
got a baby on the way,

07:53.006 --> 07:55.273
I'll be honest, I'm
feeling even more pressure.

07:55.275 --> 07:58.477
JARRETT: Well, hopefully we
get back on these things, man.

07:58.545 --> 08:01.880
TJ: Yeah, we're at the
bottom of the leaderboard count

08:01.948 --> 08:04.082
with Dot-Com and Wicked Pissah.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.818
MIKE: Pretty heavy hitters at
the bottom of the leaderboard.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.420
TIM: We'll get 'em.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.955
MIKE: Start
stocking up on diapers.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.590
JARRETT: I know, right?

08:15.095 --> 08:19.498
BOB: Look ahead of us here.
Holy (bleep).

08:23.970 --> 08:25.503
MANNY: We're in
the life today, boys.

08:25.506 --> 08:26.638
BOB: We got birds everywhere.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.975
We got humpbacks.
This is epic from here. Yeah.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.110
We're at Regal Sword,

08:32.178 --> 08:34.913
which is south of where
we've been at Crab Ledge.

08:35.782 --> 08:38.517
And even though it costs a lot
of fuel to come down here,

08:38.585 --> 08:40.151
we need to make up
for last season.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.988
Our personal goal this
season aboard Fat Tuna

08:43.056 --> 08:45.390
is we'd like to win this thing.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.192
We did pretty well last season.

08:47.260 --> 08:50.328
Not as well as we wanted
to but we beat a couple

08:50.397 --> 08:51.596
of former champions.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.464
We beat Hot Tuna,
we beat Pinwheel,

08:53.467 --> 08:55.266
we'd like to do that this year,

08:55.269 --> 08:57.035
but we'd like to beat them all.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.540
JOHN: We're gonna put out
just two baits and hopefully

09:01.608 --> 09:04.475
we drift right down into the
life and into the activity and

09:04.478 --> 09:06.278
we'll be off and running.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.415
BOB: Oh, there it
is on the bottom.

09:10.417 --> 09:14.553
There's a (bleep) ton
of bait here, boy.

09:17.491 --> 09:20.091
MANNY: Here come the whales.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.894
BOB: Marking one
at 100 I do believe.

09:23.564 --> 09:24.696
MANNY: Oh, yeah.

09:24.764 --> 09:27.732
BOB: Oh, I'm all excited.
We're already marking fish.

09:29.636 --> 09:32.704
We marked the bottom bouncers.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.974
Just in the bait on the bottom.
Just plowing through it.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.144
Then our bait is just
coming right by their face.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.914
It's on.
It's game time, baby.

09:43.383 --> 09:46.051
How are we not getting bit?

09:46.520 --> 09:47.652
(reel unspooling rapidly)

09:47.654 --> 09:50.155
Here we go. Got one.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.191
We're tight.
It looks like a big one.

09:53.660 --> 09:56.161
JOHN: Forward. Forward. Forward.
Forward. Forward. Forward.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.797
Forward. Forward. Forward.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.199
(Bob groans)

10:18.685 --> 10:20.818
(reel unspooling rapidly)

10:20.821 --> 10:23.088
MANNY: Oh!
It's a real one, boys.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.824
JOHN: Forward. Forward. Forward.
Yeah, you might wanna go harder.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.760
BOB: I'm going, baby.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.096
(tension snap)

10:31.164 --> 10:32.430
JOHN: Oh!
MANNY: Oh!

10:32.499 --> 10:35.300
BOB: Are you (bleep) kidding me?
(bleep).

10:35.702 --> 10:36.701
JOHN: Oh, no. He's still there.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.902
BOB: Oh, he's still there.
He's still there.

10:37.904 --> 10:40.672
MANNY: Oh. Good, good,
good. He's still there, boss!

10:41.174 --> 10:42.373
JOHN: Hard, hard.

10:42.376 --> 10:45.110
BOB: I saw the rod snap
back and thought you lost him.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.978
We got a good one on here.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.179
This is what
we're talking about.

10:48.248 --> 10:51.182
This is why we came, but
now we got to finish this job.

10:51.518 --> 10:52.651
I'm going forward.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.252
MANNY: Yup. You see it?
JOHN: Yeah.

10:56.256 --> 10:59.257
BOB: Nice job, John.
Way to keep reeling.

10:59.459 --> 11:00.525
MANNY: It's only a
matter of time, brother.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.727
Only a matter of time.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.764
BOB: We just got to be real
careful and get this guy on board.

11:09.269 --> 11:12.270
The way he's fighting
and taking these screaming

11:12.338 --> 11:15.006
crazy runs and showing a
lot of weight up and down,

11:15.075 --> 11:16.074
he's a good fish.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.877
He's between 90 and 100.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.613
He aren't small.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.347
MANNY: I thought he was done,
man, a half an hour ago.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.016
BOB: Y'all should
have known better.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.085
Right now, going in the guides.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.721
He's very close.
He's right here.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.424
JOHN: Get ready over here, man.
I just saw him a second ago.

11:33.427 --> 11:35.560
He's coming up tail first.
Did you see it?

11:35.829 --> 11:38.029
MANNY: Yup.
Oh, tail wrap.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.565
JOHN: Wait until I get him up.
MANNY: Yup.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.671
BOB: Did you hit him?

11:49.909 --> 11:51.042
BOB:
Did you get him good, Manny?

11:51.111 --> 11:56.247
MANNY: Yeah. Gaff.
BOB: Tail rope.

11:56.516 --> 12:00.919
MANNY: Yup. Coming.
Pull it in.

12:02.922 --> 12:05.957
BOB: Oh, boy!
Holy mackerel.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.727
Holy tuna. Yeah.

12:09.730 --> 12:13.298
This is why you
never say we got him.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.669
Now it's over.
We're going home.

12:18.672 --> 12:21.472
JOHN: Yeah. There we go.
MANNY: Woo! Yeah, baby! Woo!

12:22.008 --> 12:24.675
JOHN: Boom. BOB: Oh,
thank God. MANNY: Whoo!

12:24.678 --> 12:26.277
BOB: That's what
I'm talking about!

12:26.279 --> 12:29.647
MANNY: Yeah! BOB: Going
home. MANNY: One, two, three.

12:31.818 --> 12:33.685
Come in here, sweetheart.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.620
BOB: Oh, man.
He's a big boy.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.089
(overlapping chatter)

12:38.291 --> 12:39.691
JOHN: 96 and a quarter.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.827
ALL: Wow! JOHN: Yeah.
MANNY: Nice work, boys.

12:42.896 --> 12:46.865
JOHN: Hell yeah!
BOB: We couldn't be happier.

12:51.171 --> 12:55.439
MARCIANO: All right, here we go.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.509
We weren't having any luck in
that last spot so we decided to

12:58.512 --> 13:00.945
make a little move to
another spot close by.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.515
That big whiting is still alive.

13:03.583 --> 13:04.849
Put him on the down line.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.652
We're still not gonna chase
the bite like those other guys,

13:07.720 --> 13:09.721
but even when fishing
the old school way,

13:09.789 --> 13:11.856
you do have to shake
some things up.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.658
We caught fish here before,

13:13.726 --> 13:15.727
let's hope we can
catch them here again.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.796
JOE: Is that guy
gonna get bit or?

13:17.864 --> 13:19.764
JASON: Maybe.

13:22.268 --> 13:24.402
MARCIANO: There's a couple
of them, a couple of them.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.670
JASON: Hell yeah. Hell yeah.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.139
MARCIANO: Couple of them.
Two big ones.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.875
I'd like to see
the rod bend now.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.747
(beeping)

13:36.750 --> 13:37.815
(reel clicking)

13:37.818 --> 13:39.217
(reel unspooling rapidly)

13:39.219 --> 13:40.685
JASON: Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.220
MARCIANO: We're on?
JASON: We're on something.

13:42.288 --> 13:43.488
JOE: On something.
MARCIANO: Are you kidding me?

13:43.556 --> 13:45.757
JASON: I knew it was
something up high.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.892
Right out of my hands.
I don't know what it is.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.294
JOE: Well, we hooked
something just as we were

13:49.362 --> 13:50.428
settling on the anchor.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.164
Hopefully it's a tuna fish
and starts running here.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.433
MARCIANO: Just watch the drag.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.302
JASON: Huh?
MARCIANO: That's a fish.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.237
JASON: That's what I
thought for a second.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.840
It's gut hooked.
It was weird. It's a fish.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.509
I'll pump the drag
up just a tiny bit.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.512
MARCIANO: Come on, Jay.

14:13.319 --> 14:16.387
JASON: Porbeagle. MARCIANO:
Yup. JOE: Dammit. It's a shark.

14:17.323 --> 14:18.790
MARCIANO: That's more
than we saw all morning at

14:18.858 --> 14:20.124
the other spot.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.392
Now it wasn't what we're after.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.195
We're after tuna, so we're
gonna give it a while here and

14:24.197 --> 14:25.997
see what happens.

14:26.065 --> 14:27.799
That's been our
strategy all year.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.200
Stick and move.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.269
Put the baits out
and see what happens.

14:31.671 --> 14:35.139
Sharks come through
just before the tuna.

14:35.141 --> 14:37.375
I'm not worried yet.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.750
BOB: Back on a roll, baby.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.486
We just got our third
fish of the season.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.755
We're hoping to
take that top spot,

14:50.823 --> 14:55.693
but we're $1800 in the hole on this
trip and we'll take anything we can get.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.028
What's up, PJ?

14:57.030 --> 14:58.029
PATRICK: Hey, Bob!

14:58.097 --> 14:59.363
BOB: We got a nice
package for you.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.698
PATRICK: All right, well,
let's check this one out.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.433
BOB: Let's do it.

15:04.971 --> 15:06.103
We're happy with that fish,

15:06.106 --> 15:07.905
but we're hoping it's a
high quality fish because our

15:07.908 --> 15:10.508
expenses are
through the roof right now.

15:10.777 --> 15:13.177
Hopefully our bluefin has
a lot of fat, good color,

15:13.246 --> 15:16.614
translucent core so the buyer
will give us a great price.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.852
All right, what do we got, PJ?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.586
PATRICK: A skinny one.

15:22.922 --> 15:27.592
BOB: Whatever. PATRICK: 260
pounds dressed. BOB: We'll take it.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.661
MANNY: Hey, we'll take that.
BOB: We'll take that.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.329
MANNY: Nice job, boys.
BOB: Skinny tuna.

15:31.397 --> 15:32.463
PATRICK: All right, boys.

15:32.532 --> 15:33.598
Let's check it out.
See what we got.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.366
JOHN: All right. Sounds good.
BOB: All right, man.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.540
All right, big daddy,
what you got?

15:43.276 --> 15:45.610
PATRICK: You know, it's
really nice red, deep red.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.879
You know, the core is fine.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.115
You know, even though
it's a skinny fish, uh...

15:55.822 --> 15:57.088
$15 a pound.

15:57.156 --> 15:58.623
BOB: I like that.
Oh my God.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.291
MANNY: Are you kidding me?
BOB: We'll take that.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.960
We need some paychecks here.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.361
PATRICK: Keep 'em coming, guys.
BOB: We will. Thanks, man.

16:03.429 --> 16:04.895
JOHN: Thanks, buddy.
PATRICK: See you tomorrow.

16:04.898 --> 16:07.565
BOB: That's a damn good
start for Fat Tuna and we plan

16:07.567 --> 16:09.567
on continuing that.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.336
We wanna win this thing.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.073
Money in the bank
for a money shot.

16:22.448 --> 16:26.517
SANDRO: No bait. Nothing.
It's a (bleep) dead zone.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.187
DAVE: You guys
wanna go fish the mud?

16:29.255 --> 16:30.455
GEORDIE: I'll go in there.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.922
SANDRO: We're definitely
committed up there.

16:31.925 --> 16:33.524
We're not going
south if we go up there.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.326
DAVE: We've won this
competition more than any other

16:35.395 --> 16:37.862
boat and that puts a
huge target on our backs.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.197
We wanna secure another win,

16:40.200 --> 16:43.201
so we need to utilize strategies
that worked for us back then.

16:43.936 --> 16:46.070
If we go down to Chatham,
it's a ten-hour ride.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.939
That's not realistic.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.941
It's ten hours
however you look at it.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.876
We're not in position for that.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.612
I followed my logbook to put
us in the position of where we

16:54.614 --> 16:57.081
were able to produce in
the past and in this case,

16:57.150 --> 16:58.750
that's Middle Bank.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.152
We're not seeing any
signs of life though.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.553
Just got to keep trying,
you know what I mean?

17:02.555 --> 17:03.954
I don't wanna sit here
and just rot away.

17:03.957 --> 17:05.423
We got to, we got to
keep plugging along.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.491
SANDRO: There he is.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.025
(beeping)

17:08.028 --> 17:09.694
Holy (bleep), he
just came way up.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.228
Oh, yeah.
He's gonna eat it.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.497
DAVE: Oh, yeah.
SANDRO: Come on, eat it.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.066
Come on.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.436
DAVE: Maybe we'll
stay a little longer.

17:19.305 --> 17:20.571
(reel clicking)

17:20.573 --> 17:21.572
(reel unspooling rapidly)

17:21.641 --> 17:22.640
SANDRO: Oh, we're on!

17:22.708 --> 17:23.641
DAVE: There he is.
He's got it.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.377
Start it up, Geordie.
Hey! Hey, we're gonna.

17:26.446 --> 17:27.512
GEORDIE: Hey, we'll stay here.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.113
DAVE: Maybe we'll stay here.
Maybe we'll stay here.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.381
GEORDIE: Maybe
we'll stay here, Sandro.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.382
You wanna stay here?

17:31.451 --> 17:36.220
SANDRO: Damn! Damn!
Whamo! We're on!

17:37.190 --> 17:39.157
Slide that up real quick.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.997
By the way, we got to go.

17:49.869 --> 17:52.303
Spin it right around.
You ready?

17:53.005 --> 17:55.940
DAVE: Yep. Woo!

17:56.008 --> 17:58.643
We were just
getting ready to leave.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.880
The prime spot. It's close.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.015
SANDRO: Might get a
quick shot at him here.

18:05.018 --> 18:08.653
DAVE: Keep the pace. Don't get
excited. Get ready to get on him, Geo.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.488
SANDRO: Oh, there he is.
Making wake.

18:10.556 --> 18:11.622
GEORDIE: There he is,
making wake.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.224
SANDRO: That's a
(bleep) slammer, dude.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.558
GEORDIE: Yeah.
Big animal, no doubt.

18:14.561 --> 18:19.029
SANDRO: It's no little one.
DAVE: Here we go. Keep it going.

18:19.499 --> 18:22.033
Hit it, hit it hard.
He's coming across.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.969
SANDRO: This water is so gross.

18:25.037 --> 18:29.607
DAVE: Swivel is on the reel.
Coming up fast. Take the shot.

18:30.576 --> 18:31.843
SANDRO: I can't even see him.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.378
Just can't see him.
Can't see him.

18:41.254 --> 18:44.122
DAVE: Swivel's on the reel.
SANDRO: This water is so gross.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.725
DAVE: Coming up fast.
Take the shot.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.995
SANDRO: I can't even see him.
You just can't see him.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.864
Can't see him.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.131
GEORDIE: Good call, dude.
Good call.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.466
DAVE: Square up. Square up.
You did the right thing.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.201
Square up right away.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.402
SANDRO: If this
was clear water,

18:58.404 --> 19:00.805
I would have taken that shot.
It's just, it's muddy.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.073
It's not blue, it's not green,
it's, it's brown.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.144
And these fish are dark
on the back there so it's

19:06.212 --> 19:07.612
not easy to see him.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.748
So he's got to be pretty much
right there for me to hit him,

19:10.816 --> 19:12.349
so if I get a
decent glimpse at him,

19:12.352 --> 19:14.218
I'm gonna throw.
There he is.

19:14.621 --> 19:19.624
DAVE: Coming up again. Here we
go. Forward left! Hard, hard, hard, hard!

19:20.827 --> 19:23.728
SANDRO: The water is just mud.
Crazy.

19:25.898 --> 19:29.167
DAVE: Right here, San. Swivel.
Neutral. Neutral.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.502
SANDRO: I'm not
taking that shot.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.506
I would've had three
shots by now, probably.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.743
DAVE: Let me have a try.
Here, Sandro. Come on.

19:40.313 --> 19:43.981
SANDRO: Neutral. Swivel.

19:44.801 --> 19:46.850
DAVE: Good color.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.854
SANDRO: Head shake there.
Neutral, neutral. Coming up.

19:49.922 --> 19:50.922
Way up.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.323
DAVE: One more.
Let's not rush it.

19:52.391 --> 19:55.192
SANDRO: Yup.
Forward. Coming up, coming up.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.927
Reverse. Hard reverse.
Hard, hard, hard!

19:56.930 --> 19:58.996
DAVE: I can't see.
I can't see. I can't see.

19:59.265 --> 20:02.733
SANDRO: Coming up now.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.736
DAVE: Got him.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.072
GEORDIE: Thanks, Dave.
DAVE: Get a gaff.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.808
We don't have him yet.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.076
GEORDIE: Almost got it.

20:12.078 --> 20:15.346
DAVE: Come. Middle,
middle, middle. Let's go to port.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.950
GEORDIE: On the rod holder.

20:19.018 --> 20:21.485
DAVE: Hey, I think we
should stay in this spot.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.554
SANDRO: I think we're staying.
DAVE: I think we're staying.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.589
GEORDIE: Hey, I
think we'll stay.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.690
I think we'll spend
the afternoon here.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.024
What do you think?

20:27.026 --> 20:28.092
DAVE: That's good.
SANDRO: Wow, man.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.693
DAVE: That's a hug.
Come on, that's a hug.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.895
GEORDIE: Good going, guys.
SANDRO: Going through a battle.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.832
Wow, that felt good.
We needed that.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.166
DAVE: We got him.

20:36.169 --> 20:37.835
<i>DAVE (over radio): Big slob.</i>

20:37.837 --> 20:39.370
PAUL: Damn, damn, damn.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.639
<i>DAVE (over radio): Coming
after you guys. Whoo!</i>

20:41.974 --> 20:44.075
TYLER: Have a nice ride.
We suck.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.978
(yawn)

20:49.315 --> 20:51.782
SANDRO: Let's see
what he measures, guys.

20:52.719 --> 20:53.851
100 inches.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.953
GEORDIE: 100 inches.
SANDRO: Wow. GEORDIE: Nice.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.256
SANDRO: There we go, big one.

20:58.858 --> 21:02.693
DAVE: That's one step closer
to reclaiming our crown.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.898
TJ: We're still here
on Loser's Ledge.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.467
A whole lot of nothing.

21:10.470 --> 21:13.937
You know, but ultimately
you wanna try and find the life

21:13.940 --> 21:15.706
and we're not
really seeing the life.

21:15.725 --> 21:17.541
It's been a really
tough season so far.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.344
We still have no fish and
now I'm worried about Reba.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.813
Come on, Reba,
get in here, baby.

21:22.815 --> 21:27.151
JARRETT: Good girl.
How's Reba been doing with?

21:27.687 --> 21:29.019
TJ: It hasn't been
too rough, you know,

21:29.022 --> 21:30.154
she's been pretty good.

21:30.156 --> 21:31.756
MIKE: Chilling in the
bag until she got rocked.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.357
TJ: Yeah. Come on, Ripple.

21:33.359 --> 21:36.694
Reba recently had bone cancer
and I had to remove her leg so,

21:36.762 --> 21:38.629
you know, she's definitely
having some health issues,

21:38.698 --> 21:41.165
but she's still happy, she's
out there barking at whales,

21:41.233 --> 21:44.802
so until I feel like she
can't physically be out there,

21:44.837 --> 21:46.771
I'm gonna take her every trip.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.039
Last year, the Hot Tuna didn't
have such a great season.

21:49.042 --> 21:51.241
We only finished ahead of the
Moonshine and the Time Flies,

21:51.244 --> 21:53.510
so this year I've got
to get the boat headed in

21:53.513 --> 21:54.645
the right direction.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.113
We have to come back strong.

21:56.115 --> 22:00.418
JARRETT: Good girls.
TJ: We need action ASAP.

22:09.128 --> 22:10.528
GEORDIE: That required
some patience, huh?

22:10.596 --> 22:13.464
DAVE: Yup. What's up, Scott?
SCOTT: It's been a while.

22:13.532 --> 22:14.932
First time seeing
you guys this year.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.335
DAVE: Yeah. Right.
We got some catching up to do.

22:17.403 --> 22:18.669
SCOTT: Let's see if
you got the quality.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.005
DAVE: Let's do it.

22:29.215 --> 22:30.548
GEORDIE: What's that
thing dressed, Scott?

22:30.616 --> 22:32.483
SCOTT: 379 pounds dressed.
DAVE: Oh, nice.

22:32.551 --> 22:37.488
GEORDIE: Awesome. Nice.
Yeah, that's a nice piece.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.889
DAVE: What do you think there?

22:38.891 --> 22:40.825
SCOTT: It's a big fish.
You got the quantity.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.493
There's not a lot of fat in it,

22:42.561 --> 22:45.162
but it's not like
that red rubber boot.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.431
DAVE: Mmm-hmm, well, with all
that said, let's see the core.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.567
SCOTT: Let's check it out.
SANDRO: Ooh. That looks good.

22:50.970 --> 22:54.071
SCOTT: That's a nice
cherry looking color.

22:54.107 --> 22:55.906
DAVE: What do you
think there, pal?

22:55.975 --> 22:58.642
SCOTT: Well, because it
does have that nice red color,

22:58.711 --> 23:01.479
I could still get you guys...

23:03.116 --> 23:04.515
13 bucks a pound.

23:04.517 --> 23:05.849
DAVE: Yeah. We'll take that.
That's good.

23:05.852 --> 23:06.917
SANDRO: Yeah.
That is very good.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.519
SCOTT: All right, guys.
Nice job.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.120
DAVE: Thanks, buddy.
GEORDIE: Appreciate you, Scott.

23:10.123 --> 23:11.455
DAVE: Thank you very much.
Good seeing you.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.157
GEORDIE: Good to see you.

23:14.327 --> 23:16.861
DAVE: Not too shabby, huh?
SANDRO: No, not at all.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.802
RYAN: Yeah. Want to put him out?
SPURGE: Yeah.

23:25.538 --> 23:28.472
Dot-Com and Fat Tuna both
caught earlier today and

23:28.541 --> 23:30.607
we haven't even marked any.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.676
I know we're in a great
spot though and our protege,

23:32.678 --> 23:35.613
Tyler is out fishing next to us.

23:35.882 --> 23:39.083
We got to get one before he
does or it's just embarrassing.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.084
RYAN: Putting fresh baits out.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.219
Our down line,

23:42.288 --> 23:44.755
something to clean this up
and eat our squid off of it.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.891
SPURGE: Uh-hmm. I'm a
very competitive person,

23:47.159 --> 23:48.159
I really am.

23:48.227 --> 23:50.027
So, my goal for this
season is to catch the most

23:50.029 --> 23:51.695
fish and out fish everybody.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.697
RYAN: So, we
changed our bait out.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.233
We put a nice mackerel
and on our floater,

23:56.235 --> 23:57.768
we're gonna put
out another squid.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.436
This one's a little
bigger than the last.

23:59.439 --> 24:00.838
SPURGE: We had a
tough season last year,

24:00.906 --> 24:03.040
but they don't call me
Father Tuna for nothing.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.775
You know, we can fish
with the best of them,

24:04.777 --> 24:06.510
so we're gonna win it this year.

24:06.512 --> 24:09.046
The worst thing I hate
is equipment failure,

24:09.048 --> 24:10.915
so we try to eliminate all that.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.583
VAUGHNS: It's early
in the season,

24:12.651 --> 24:15.186
but I've already learned
so much from Spurge.

24:15.654 --> 24:17.321
SPURGE: Well, it's just
different types of baits you're

24:17.323 --> 24:19.256
putting out and different ways
to rig them and, you know,

24:19.258 --> 24:21.792
you eventually find out
what works the best.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.194
VAUGHNS: Learning from
the best of the best has been

24:24.197 --> 24:28.065
a real honor and I know it's
only the tip of the iceberg so far.

24:28.267 --> 24:30.334
RYAN: Let's see what happens.
SPURGE: Yeah.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.339
(beeping)

24:35.407 --> 24:37.408
RYAN: Oh. Big mark.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.044
VAUGHNS: Come on, buddy.
SPURGE: Any minute now.

24:41.881 --> 24:45.850
VAUGHNS: Come on.
Oh. Get back over here.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.152
RYAN: Something just
came up out of that.

24:49.155 --> 24:52.289
(beeping)

24:52.358 --> 24:54.024
(reel clicking)

24:54.026 --> 24:55.425
(reel unspooling rapidly)

24:55.428 --> 24:58.162
SPURGE: We're on!
VAUGHNS: I got it.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.233
RYAN: Finally got our bite.
Finally got hooked up here.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.103
(bleep)

25:06.105 --> 25:07.905
(groans)

25:14.380 --> 25:15.512
SPURGE: Good going, team.

25:15.515 --> 25:17.548
Let's get this one right
in front of the Pinwheel.

25:22.121 --> 25:25.389
TYLER: Oh boy, they're on.
Spurge just hooked up.

25:26.592 --> 25:28.692
MARISSA: Wow.
TYLER: (bleep).

25:29.862 --> 25:32.396
MARISSA: Well, there's a
few tunas swimming around.

25:32.932 --> 25:34.398
SPURGE: He's coming up fast.

25:34.466 --> 25:37.468
RYAN: He's coming up fast.
Oh, fish feels nice here.

25:38.404 --> 25:40.270
We're already up
on the top shot.

25:40.273 --> 25:42.940
Came up a little weird,
uh, but he feels pretty decent

25:42.942 --> 25:44.275
here on the line.

25:44.343 --> 25:46.610
We got the leader right here.
Swivel. Color.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.954
SPURGE: Come on, Spurge.
Get away from there.

25:58.341 --> 26:00.424
RYAN: I wanna try to
get past the ball here.

26:00.426 --> 26:02.359
VAUGHNS: Oh, what the?

26:06.065 --> 26:07.681
SPURGE: It's gonna
cut our fish off.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.935
Oh, boy.
This sucks right here.

26:19.328 --> 26:21.328
SPURGE: It's gonna
cut our fish off.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.497
Oh, boy.
This sucks right here.

26:24.066 --> 26:25.332
Back off, back off.

26:25.401 --> 26:27.935
RYAN: We're off. We're off.
SPURGE: Get ready with a gaff.

26:27.937 --> 26:30.704
This side. Pick it up.

26:31.741 --> 26:35.409
RYAN: The fish just got
caught up on our anchor,

26:35.878 --> 26:38.211
so now we're just trying
to free him up and hopefully

26:38.214 --> 26:39.546
we can land this guy.

26:39.548 --> 26:41.015
SPURGE: Over my head if you can.

26:41.083 --> 26:43.751
It's caught here,
I'm just telling you.

26:44.487 --> 26:46.086
I got to back up. Hold.
Somebody hold this.

26:46.155 --> 26:47.621
VAUGHNS: All right. I got it.

26:47.690 --> 26:48.956
SPURGE: See if you can
pick that up a little bit.

26:48.958 --> 26:51.025
Get the ball and everything.
Keep going.

26:51.093 --> 26:52.493
RYAN: Still underneath it.

26:52.561 --> 26:53.894
VAUGHNS: Come on, come
back to me one more time and

26:53.963 --> 26:55.829
then just go over it.

26:56.499 --> 26:59.300
SPURGE: Just put it in that
rod holder over at the end here.

27:01.570 --> 27:02.903
There's our ball again.

27:02.972 --> 27:04.972
RYAN: Yeah. (bleep) typical.
SPURGE: Where's the tether?

27:05.040 --> 27:07.541
Walk it under him.

27:08.644 --> 27:10.644
You know,
he's coming back again.

27:10.646 --> 27:13.047
All right, throw it
out there if you can.

27:15.584 --> 27:17.050
RYAN: There he is on top.

27:17.053 --> 27:19.586
SPURGE: I know.
I'm trying to get away from it.

27:19.789 --> 27:21.922
Ryan did get a lot better
than he was last year,

27:21.991 --> 27:24.058
it's very important you don't
get tangled in the anchor,

27:24.093 --> 27:26.193
but I taught him the right
way to do things and he did

27:26.195 --> 27:27.728
a good job with that.

27:27.796 --> 27:30.864
I think you're gonna see
the leader shortly here.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.200
There you go.
He's coming nice.

27:33.202 --> 27:35.069
He's coming up in what
we call death circles.

27:35.137 --> 27:36.337
They start circling.

27:36.405 --> 27:37.471
RYAN: Pinwheel.

27:37.539 --> 27:38.605
SPURGE: If we can keep
him in that same circle,

27:38.607 --> 27:40.207
we can get him up and get
a shot with the harpoon.

27:40.275 --> 27:42.810
Sometimes they cooperate
and a lot of times they don't.

27:43.679 --> 27:45.812
All right, get the,
your harpoon ready.

27:46.015 --> 27:49.083
VAUGHNS: Coming at you, Cap.
RYAN: Oh, he's a nice fish.

27:51.553 --> 27:57.458
SPURGE: Get the tail gaff.
Come on. Hurry up.

27:58.894 --> 28:01.228
RYAN: There you go.
SPURGE: Hurry up.

28:01.831 --> 28:04.098
RYAN: Woo-hoo!
SPURGE: All right, nice going.

28:04.166 --> 28:05.632
RYAN: Yeah.

28:05.701 --> 28:08.235
SPURGE: There you go, baby. Nice
going. Nice going. Good job. Good job.

28:08.237 --> 28:09.970
Number two.

28:09.972 --> 28:13.040
Thank you Lord.
Thank you very much.

28:13.042 --> 28:15.576
We appreciate that.
A little blessing at the sea.

28:15.644 --> 28:16.977
VAUGHNS: Good job, good job.

28:17.046 --> 28:18.178
SPURGE: Good job, boys.
Nice job.

28:18.247 --> 28:20.180
RYAN: Our second fish
to keep the streak going.

28:20.182 --> 28:22.516
Woo!

28:26.255 --> 28:29.523
TYLER: Spurge just caught one.
MARISSA: Excuse me?

28:29.859 --> 28:31.525
TYLER: It's a good feeling
starting out the season in

28:31.593 --> 28:33.860
first place, but at the same
time you know the bull's eye is

28:33.863 --> 28:34.862
on your back.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.330
Now that Spurge has caught,

28:36.398 --> 28:38.465
that's another boat
that's threatening our lead.

28:38.534 --> 28:40.701
At least we know
they're in the area.

28:41.537 --> 28:43.737
Merm, come do a bait check.

28:43.739 --> 28:46.273
(breech and splash)

28:46.275 --> 28:49.476
What the (bleep) just came
up next to the boat, a tuna?

28:49.612 --> 28:52.546
We're on! We're on!
Reel that up, quick.

28:56.419 --> 28:58.952
VAUGHNS: Oh, he just hook up?
I think he just hooked up.

28:58.954 --> 29:00.954
SPURGE: Good.

29:01.023 --> 29:02.756
TYLER: Attagirl, Merm.
You're doing great.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.357
MARISSA: Are they coming
to show us their fish?

29:04.360 --> 29:05.826
TYLER: Probably.

29:05.894 --> 29:07.294
SPURGE: Go get 'em, Merm.

29:07.362 --> 29:09.296
TYLER: That's my sis.

29:09.565 --> 29:12.166
Keep getting him, Merm. Keep
getting him. You're doing great.

29:12.234 --> 29:13.834
He's big.

29:14.169 --> 29:15.569
(tension snap)

29:15.571 --> 29:17.037
MARISSA: Whoa! Broke him off.

29:17.039 --> 29:19.106
SPURGE: Oh!

29:19.174 --> 29:20.507
TYLER: That was
definitely a tuna.

29:20.509 --> 29:22.576
Spurge just went by on
the Moonshine towing one.

29:22.578 --> 29:24.311
We're over here losing fish.

29:24.313 --> 29:25.879
Not cool.

29:29.118 --> 29:31.251
<i>SPURGE (over radio):
Just in case you missed it.</i>

29:32.388 --> 29:33.386
TYLER: Really frustrating.

29:33.389 --> 29:35.055
We watched Spurge
catch a fish in our face.

29:35.124 --> 29:36.523
You know, now we're
just going through gear,

29:36.525 --> 29:37.591
going through baits,

29:37.593 --> 29:39.860
costing us time and
money having to re-rig.

29:39.862 --> 29:42.696
It's just part of fishing.
Forgot all about it.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.333
MARISSA: Share
the wealth a little bit.

29:46.335 --> 29:47.667
TYLER: We suck.

29:47.670 --> 29:50.604
SPURGE: Ready?
One, two. Come on.

29:51.407 --> 29:54.041
RYAN: Trying to get a
measurement on him here real quick.

29:55.477 --> 29:58.345
VAUGHNS: 93 inches.
SPURGE: Fat little sucker.

29:58.814 --> 30:01.281
RYAN: Tagged and bagged
and on the way home.

30:07.223 --> 30:08.755
SPURGE: Bring one
in every day keeps the

30:08.824 --> 30:10.490
bill collector away.

30:10.493 --> 30:11.691
PATRICK: Hey, Spurge.
How's it going?

30:11.694 --> 30:13.627
SPURGE: We're doing great.
Wanna take a look at him?

30:13.646 --> 30:15.228
PATRICK: Yeah,
let's take a look.

30:15.231 --> 30:17.064
SPURGE: All right.
PATRICK: See what we got.

30:24.106 --> 30:25.572
SPURGE: What's the word?
What's the word here?

30:25.641 --> 30:27.641
PATRICK: What's the word?
We got 305 dressed.

30:27.643 --> 30:28.842
SPURGE: All right.
Perfect. Perfect.

30:28.844 --> 30:30.377
PATRICK: All right, let's
check the meat out, Spurge.

30:30.379 --> 30:31.512
See what we got here.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.113
SPURGE: All right.
Let's see what we got.

30:33.449 --> 30:37.851
All right.
These guys did a great job.

30:38.254 --> 30:39.319
PATRICK: Way to go, guys.

30:39.321 --> 30:40.521
No, you got a nice
looking fish here.

30:40.589 --> 30:43.123
Good sellable size.
Could use a little bit more fat.

30:43.125 --> 30:44.925
It's a little
watery to the touch.

30:44.993 --> 30:46.927
VAUGHNS: How's the
quality of the core on it?

30:46.929 --> 30:49.196
PATRICK: The core is beautiful.
You guys took good care of it.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.198
Nice cherry red core there.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.133
VAUGHNS: Really nice core.
SPURGE: So what do you think?

30:53.202 --> 30:54.668
What do you think the
verdict is on this one?

30:54.736 --> 30:56.937
PATRICK: Uh, this one here.
SPURGE: Come on, baby.

31:00.476 --> 31:02.409
PATRICK: We
could do $12 a pound.

31:02.477 --> 31:03.410
VAUGHNS: Oh!

31:03.478 --> 31:04.478
SPURGE: All right.
There we go, buddy.

31:04.546 --> 31:06.079
Nice going. Nice going.
Good job. Good job.

31:06.081 --> 31:07.814
VAUGHNS: All right.
PATRICK: Way to go, boys.

31:07.816 --> 31:08.882
VAUGHNS: All right.

31:08.951 --> 31:10.417
SPURGE: Thank you, Spurge.
Thank you. Very good.

31:10.419 --> 31:11.885
PATRICK: All right, boys.
TJ, good seeing you.

31:11.887 --> 31:13.020
Ryan, keep 'em coming.

31:13.088 --> 31:14.021
SPURGE: We're in a fight.

31:14.089 --> 31:15.222
We got to keep the pace up,

31:15.290 --> 31:17.424
the momentum up and we wanna
catch another fish tomorrow,

31:17.492 --> 31:19.993
so we're gonna try our best.

31:23.899 --> 31:26.066
That's the way to roll.

31:39.048 --> 31:40.781
JACK: Some (bleep)
gnarly (bleep).

31:40.849 --> 31:43.016
NICHOLAS: Yeah, getting
our (bleep) kicked in.

31:46.188 --> 31:48.388
New England fishing,
that's just how it is.

31:48.457 --> 31:50.724
JACK: Yeah, the storm kind
of came out of nowhere.

31:50.726 --> 31:52.859
This was not supposed to happen.

31:52.928 --> 31:54.728
This is (bleep).

31:54.796 --> 31:56.930
Not one foot of last year.

31:56.932 --> 31:59.866
NICHOLAS: Oh, it's
blowing 35 all day.

32:00.135 --> 32:02.669
JACK: Yeah, we're
in quite a little squall here.

32:02.738 --> 32:05.272
Right now, we're fishing out
here in our own backyard,

32:05.340 --> 32:06.673
Jeffrey's Ledge.

32:06.875 --> 32:08.875
We know Dot-Com caught
one out here yesterday and

32:08.944 --> 32:11.278
we're hoping we can do the same.

32:11.413 --> 32:13.280
Go ahead and pick
me out a good one.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.548
NICHOLAS: Yeah.
We got a slamming mack in there.

32:15.551 --> 32:17.684
JACK: Yeah, that's what we want.

32:18.487 --> 32:20.287
Last season, we came into
the fleet looking to make

32:20.355 --> 32:22.956
some waves and, you know,
we finished in last.

32:23.025 --> 32:25.692
You know, that definitely left
a bad taste in our mouths.

32:25.761 --> 32:27.027
So, you know, this year,

32:27.095 --> 32:29.296
we wanted to come
out here and say, you know,

32:29.364 --> 32:30.830
not only can we hang
with the rest of the fleet,

32:30.833 --> 32:32.799
but we can beat them.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.111
It's a little
rainy out right now.

32:44.179 --> 32:46.179
Kind of been like that all day.

32:46.181 --> 32:48.515
It's a different game
in the center console.

32:48.517 --> 32:51.051
You know, not much, uh,
not much room to hide from it.

32:51.586 --> 32:53.020
NICHOLAS: Oh, we're on!
We're on!

32:55.257 --> 32:56.390
JACK: We just went off.
NICHOLAS: Yes, sir.

32:57.926 --> 33:00.193
NICHOLAS: Coming up.
JACK: There he is! Woo!

33:01.864 --> 33:05.465
NICHOLAS: It's a real one, Jack.
JACK: Yeah, I know. I know.

33:05.467 --> 33:07.701
Nice work, buddy.

33:09.004 --> 33:10.470
NICHOLAS: Go, Jack. Forward.

33:10.472 --> 33:13.857
JACK: Yeah. NICHOLAS:
Easy. JACK: All right.

33:14.476 --> 33:16.543
Fighting a fish in a squall
this strong puts a lot of

33:16.611 --> 33:19.212
pressure on the line
and it could break off,

33:19.214 --> 33:21.281
so we have to move the
rod to the front of the boat

33:21.283 --> 33:22.949
so we can get a
better angle on the fish.

33:22.951 --> 33:24.017
All right, take a break.

33:24.019 --> 33:25.085
NICHOLAS: Yeah.

33:25.153 --> 33:26.353
JACK: Point the
engines at the fish.

33:26.355 --> 33:28.021
NICHOLAS: Yep.

33:31.560 --> 33:32.893
JACK: You got to
watch this line.

33:40.369 --> 33:43.436
JACK: Slight reverse.
One reverse. Neutral!

33:43.439 --> 33:45.405
Neutral!

33:53.432 --> 33:54.631
JACK: All right, take a break.
NICHOLAS: Yeah.

33:54.699 --> 33:55.632
JACK: Point the
engines at the fish.

33:55.700 --> 33:56.666
NICHOLAS: Yep.

34:01.239 --> 34:02.239
JACK: You got to
watch this line.

34:09.581 --> 34:14.051
JACK: Slight reverse. NICK:
Yeah, one reverse. JACK: Clear.

34:20.192 --> 34:24.561
JACK: Neutral! Neutral!
Go ahead and bring the dart up.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.696
NICHOLAS: Yep.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.270
JACK: Be careful
with the waves, Nick.

34:35.607 --> 34:36.940
NICHOLAS: All right,
he's coming up.

34:47.019 --> 34:48.351
NICHOLAS: (bleep).

34:48.420 --> 34:50.620
JACK: Well, we got a
little one on here.

34:50.622 --> 34:53.690
I can tell he's short just
by looking at him.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.208
That sucks.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.027
NICHOLAS: I know. I know.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.796
JACK: Yeah, he's probably
like 70 inches. He's pissed off.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.465
NICHOLAS: Yeah.

35:03.769 --> 35:06.636
JACK: This is a heartbreaker.
This fish is definitely a short.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.372
Get the hook out of him.

35:09.441 --> 35:10.974
When it's rough
weather out here,

35:11.042 --> 35:12.909
the extra tension on the
line can make it really hard

35:12.911 --> 35:14.978
to tell if it's a keeper.

35:14.997 --> 35:16.646
This one's not 73 inches though,

35:16.715 --> 35:18.048
so we got to let it go.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.916
(bleep)!

35:26.925 --> 35:28.057
That fish threw it.

35:28.060 --> 35:30.393
Get the (bleep) baits back out.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.963
(bleep), dude.
This is (bleep) messed up.

35:35.133 --> 35:39.069
All right. Well, uh, hopefully,

35:39.538 --> 35:42.606
we can get another one soon so
we can get some money coming in.

35:43.875 --> 35:47.544
Nothing we can do but put
the baits back out, buddy.

35:53.018 --> 35:55.084
TJ: Crab Ledge was
not so good to us.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.354
It was good to Bobby Cooky
and the Spice Girls,

35:57.422 --> 35:59.890
but not the losers
on the Hot Tuna.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.592
I mean, this place has
shown us no love, so.

36:02.611 --> 36:04.961
JARRETT: No love.

36:04.963 --> 36:06.096
TJ: Sometimes you're the dog,

36:06.164 --> 36:07.297
sometimes you're the hydrant.

36:07.365 --> 36:09.165
And right now we got to go
find something else to piss on

36:09.168 --> 36:11.368
because we are
certainly the hydrant.

36:11.970 --> 36:14.103
JARRETT: You just
got to have no fog where you

36:14.106 --> 36:15.371
find all the life.

36:15.374 --> 36:16.706
TJ: That's the problem
with this place.

36:16.708 --> 36:18.241
If you get this fog,
you can't find the life,

36:18.310 --> 36:19.509
the whales and the birds,

36:19.578 --> 36:21.044
you ain't gonna find
the tuna, that's for sure.

36:21.046 --> 36:22.646
Gonna have to find greener
pastures because this hasn't

36:22.714 --> 36:23.980
been the ticket for us.

36:24.049 --> 36:26.716
I think our next move is
gonna be somewhere up the road.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.184
JARRETT: I'm gonna put
the rubber bands on this

36:28.187 --> 36:29.452
one for the 180.

36:29.454 --> 36:31.087
TJ: All right.

36:33.458 --> 36:35.124
JARRETT: Well, I missed a
couple days of fishing out here

36:35.127 --> 36:36.192
with these guys.

36:36.195 --> 36:37.727
It's not like they
had some good action,

36:37.729 --> 36:40.997
but showed up a day
late and a dollar short.

36:40.999 --> 36:42.799
I mean I got a whole
another mouth to feed now,

36:42.801 --> 36:45.202
so we definitely have
to catch some fish.

36:45.270 --> 36:47.270
You know, I was hoping
to come down here and give

36:47.339 --> 36:49.940
them some good luck,
but it is what it is.

36:50.675 --> 36:54.544
So, heading in going north
and see if we can regroup and

36:54.546 --> 36:56.746
get back on these fish.

36:56.748 --> 36:58.281
That's all you can really do.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.883
It's fishing.

37:01.886 --> 37:04.754
TJ: Got to find
something different.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.699
JOE: My boy Jay's birthday.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.902
Hopefully we get a nice
fat bluefin for him.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.070
JASON: You know,
there's better ways to spend

37:20.105 --> 37:23.440
a birthday for sure.

37:24.243 --> 37:27.577
Haven't caught a tuna fish yet,

37:27.979 --> 37:30.847
but a paycheck's
always a nice birthday present.

37:31.116 --> 37:32.782
MARCIANO: If we mark,
it'll definitely go,

37:32.784 --> 37:36.786
I'm telling you now.
High tide slack right now boys.

37:37.389 --> 37:38.988
It's primetime.

37:38.991 --> 37:41.992
We struck out yesterday,
which is a major setback.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.861
Every day the boat's on
the water and not catching,

37:44.929 --> 37:47.397
it's money coming
out of my pocket.

37:48.267 --> 37:51.334
We've decided to try another
one of my secret spots that's

37:51.403 --> 37:52.869
paid off for me before.

37:53.872 --> 37:56.806
Hopefully this new location
and it being Jay's birthday

37:56.808 --> 37:58.975
will turn our luck around.

38:01.212 --> 38:02.746
Jay's putting a rig out.

38:02.814 --> 38:05.682
I didn't have time to
bake him a cake this trip,

38:05.684 --> 38:07.484
so the least I
could do was get him a

38:07.552 --> 38:09.252
happy birthday balloon.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.421
JASON: What's that?

38:11.423 --> 38:13.023
MARCIANO: I got you something
for your birthday, Jay.

38:13.091 --> 38:15.825
I got you your own
birthday balloon just like

38:15.827 --> 38:17.160
when you were a kid.

38:17.228 --> 38:18.895
JASON: Awesome.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.030
MARCIANO: I'm even gonna
sing happy birthday to you.

38:21.033 --> 38:23.633
JASON: Yeah, I doubt it.
JOE: Send it out there.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.635
MARCIANO: All right, Jay.
Send it out.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.871
JASON: Sending it.
Thanks, Dave.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.911
(beeping)

38:34.913 --> 38:37.847
MARCIANO: Down line's gonna go!
Down line's gonna go!

38:37.916 --> 38:39.182
(beeping)

38:39.184 --> 38:40.249
(reel clicking)

38:40.252 --> 38:42.185
(reel unspooling rapidly)

38:42.253 --> 38:43.453
JASON: Oh, here we go.
Here we go.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.321
JOE: We're on!

38:45.657 --> 38:47.523
MARCIANO: Wind on it, Jay.
Don't stop. Don't stop!

38:47.526 --> 38:49.292
JOE: Got him on!

38:59.888 --> 39:01.554
JASON: Oh, here we go.
Here we go.

39:01.556 --> 39:03.823
JOE: We're on!

39:03.825 --> 39:06.426
MARCIANO: Wind on it, Jay.
Don't stop. Don't stop!

39:06.494 --> 39:07.760
Get it tight.

39:07.763 --> 39:10.296
JOE: Got him on!
We're tight.

39:10.365 --> 39:13.166
JASON: That's a wicked
birthday screamer.

39:13.168 --> 39:16.502
MARCIANO: It's definitely a
tuna fish and it's Jay's birthday,

39:16.505 --> 39:19.772
so I really hope we can land
this one just for Jay's sake.

39:19.775 --> 39:21.974
Attaboy, Jay.

39:22.243 --> 39:24.177
JASON: I've caught 'em on
my birthday and I've lost 'em

39:24.245 --> 39:25.578
on my birthday.

39:25.580 --> 39:28.782
Hopefully we can land this
birthday diamond bluefin.

39:31.520 --> 39:32.919
Joe, you wanna get over here?

39:32.987 --> 39:34.454
JOE: Yeah, bud. You good?
You need a break?

39:34.456 --> 39:35.655
JASON: Yeah.
I don't need a break.

39:35.724 --> 39:37.657
It's my party and I
want you to have fun.

39:37.726 --> 39:40.293
JOE: Cool.
Thanks for inviting me, bro.

39:44.866 --> 39:47.801
MARCIANO: Getting a little
nautical out here, boys.

39:48.937 --> 39:51.738
Just hope we can land this
one before it gets too rough.

39:51.806 --> 39:54.140
Hope our luck holds and
we can land this one, boys.

39:54.409 --> 39:56.209
We'll be on one
heck of a roll still.

39:57.412 --> 39:59.979
Attaboy, Joe.
You're doing good.

40:02.684 --> 40:05.084
(bleep).
I got my<i> Depends</i> all wet.

40:05.887 --> 40:07.620
JASON: Uncle Dave,
get the hell on there.

40:07.689 --> 40:08.621
MARCIANO: I ain't
getting on there.

40:08.690 --> 40:09.889
JASON: Get the (bleep) on there.

40:09.891 --> 40:11.157
MARCIANO: All right,
I'll take a couple cranks.

40:11.159 --> 40:13.159
JOE: Yeah, your doctor
said you got to exercise.

40:13.161 --> 40:14.494
You know, you got to
take little cranks on

40:14.562 --> 40:16.696
the reel, all right?

40:16.698 --> 40:17.964
All right, we'll
start the clock now.

40:17.966 --> 40:20.900
That's ten minutes
timing and cardio.

40:21.636 --> 40:23.302
MARCIANO: This is my
ten-minute cardio workout?

40:23.305 --> 40:26.973
JOE: Yeah. JASON: Reel!
JOE: You're doing great.

40:30.378 --> 40:31.978
MARCIANO: I'm feeling good.
I'm feeling good.

40:32.046 --> 40:35.448
All right, guys, let's go
back to our winning positions.

40:35.984 --> 40:37.650
We had a system,
let's not change it.

40:46.728 --> 40:49.061
We'll get him, boys.
We'll get him. Stay focused.

40:49.064 --> 40:50.396
We know what to do.

40:50.465 --> 40:52.766
Deep color. Come on, fish.

40:53.802 --> 40:55.268
JASON: Swivel.

40:55.270 --> 40:57.737
MARCIANO: Right under the surface
out there. Almost got a look at him.

40:57.806 --> 40:58.805
ALL: There he is.

40:58.807 --> 41:00.273
MARCIANO: Big fish.
Big (bleep) fish.

41:00.341 --> 41:01.874
JASON: Yeah, it is a big fish.

41:01.877 --> 41:05.845
MARCIANO: Just get close
enough to get that dart in him.

41:07.015 --> 41:08.614
JASON: Get that other dart.
All right, here he comes,

41:08.617 --> 41:10.884
Dave. Right there. Right there.

41:11.753 --> 41:13.619
Good shot.
Pass me on the right.

41:13.622 --> 41:15.088
MARCIANO: I don't know
how well I got him.

41:15.156 --> 41:17.089
JASON: Gaff dart, Joe.
MARCIANO: There you go, Joe.

41:17.092 --> 41:18.758
Yeah. Tail strap right here.

41:18.760 --> 41:20.026
JASON: On the other side.
MARCIANO: Other side.

41:20.028 --> 41:22.695
Here we go.
Right in there, boys.

41:23.832 --> 41:25.765
Yeah, boys.
Happy birthday, Jay.

41:25.834 --> 41:27.366
JASON: Thank you, Marciano.

41:27.369 --> 41:28.635
JOE: Nice bluefin.
Good job, my dude.

41:28.703 --> 41:29.702
Happy birthday.

41:29.771 --> 41:30.903
MARCIANO: All right,
well, that's it.

41:30.906 --> 41:33.573
We'll be in in plenty of
time to get this to the buyer

41:33.641 --> 41:35.441
and ship back out tonight.

41:36.645 --> 41:38.244
JASON: And hopefully Scotty
will give me an extra little

41:38.313 --> 41:40.313
bonus for my birthday bluefin.

41:40.381 --> 41:41.848
JOE: Nice!

41:42.651 --> 41:44.851
MARCIANO: We came right out
of the starting gate this year.

41:44.853 --> 41:47.921
And we now got that momentum
still surging forward.

41:48.790 --> 41:50.056
Ready?

41:50.058 --> 41:53.326
JASON: Yup, down.
It's a huge fish for us.

41:53.328 --> 41:55.662
Since it's my birthday,
I'll do the honors.

41:55.997 --> 41:57.330
93 incher!

41:57.332 --> 41:59.131
MARCIANO: Well, well done.
Happy birthday, Jay.

41:59.134 --> 42:02.068
I'll go call the buyer
and set up the drop off.

42:02.136 --> 42:06.005
JOE: Got him.
MARCIANO: Excellent job, boys.

42:16.284 --> 42:17.817
JASON: What's up, Scotty?
SCOTT: Another one, huh?

42:17.819 --> 42:19.018
MARCIANO: The roll continues.

42:19.087 --> 42:20.887
JASON: This is a
nice package, Scotty.

42:20.889 --> 42:22.922
SCOTT: All right, guys.
Show me what you got.

42:32.967 --> 42:35.501
You guys are looking
at 337 pounds dressed.

42:35.570 --> 42:36.836
MARCIANO: That's a nice size.

42:36.905 --> 42:38.905
SCOTT: Beautiful
birthday fish right here.

42:38.973 --> 42:40.440
MARCIANO: Okay.
That's what we like to hear.

42:40.508 --> 42:42.408
SCOTT: Why don't
you guys come up?

42:43.645 --> 42:44.644
MARCIANO: Look at that.

42:44.712 --> 42:46.913
I can see the grease
shining from over here.

42:46.915 --> 42:47.914
JOE: That's a fat fish.

42:47.916 --> 42:49.115
SCOTT: You can see
all the fat in it.

42:49.183 --> 42:50.316
MARCIANO: Yup.

42:50.318 --> 42:51.918
SCOTT: And he's definitely
been eating because he's really

42:51.920 --> 42:53.653
loaded right here in the minors.

42:53.655 --> 42:55.187
MARCIANO: Created an
oil slick when I threw the

42:55.190 --> 42:56.322
harpoon in it.

42:56.391 --> 42:58.591
SCOTT: This fish
really is it's nice.

42:58.593 --> 43:01.060
This is one of those big
money fish right here.

43:01.796 --> 43:04.330
MARCIANO: So let's
see that core, Scotty.

43:04.666 --> 43:06.132
JASON: Beautiful.
Really nice fish.

43:06.134 --> 43:07.267
MARCIANO: That's a good core.

43:07.335 --> 43:09.001
JASON: We didn't see a lot
of fish like this last year.

43:09.004 --> 43:10.870
MARCIANO: No, we didn't.
It was a tough year.

43:10.872 --> 43:12.805
What's gonna be our cut, Scotty?

43:12.874 --> 43:14.874
SCOTT: Bottom line, Dave...

43:17.612 --> 43:18.811
19 bucks a pound.

43:18.813 --> 43:20.413
MARCIANO: Happy birthday, Jay.

43:20.415 --> 43:22.215
JASON: I'm getting a
birthday check today.

43:22.283 --> 43:23.616
MARCIANO: Yeah, birthday check.

43:23.685 --> 43:26.419
Maybe even I'll
buy you a Happy Meal.

43:26.421 --> 43:27.954
SCOTT: Happy birthday, man.
JASON: Thank you very much.

43:28.022 --> 43:29.088
SCOTT: See ya later.

43:29.090 --> 43:30.156
MARCIANO: Scotty,
thank you my friend.

43:30.224 --> 43:31.757
SCOTT: Appreciate it.
Take care, guys. Good luck.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.359
MARCIANO: The demand
for seafood is back up and

43:33.361 --> 43:35.561
what that means
for fishermen like me,

43:35.630 --> 43:38.431
when you catch quality
high premium seafood,

43:38.499 --> 43:40.433
you're gonna get
paid a lot of money.

43:40.435 --> 43:44.304
It turned out to be a
good birthday for Jay.

43:44.372 --> 43:46.038
The icing on the cake,

43:46.041 --> 43:48.374
it's the best fish
of the season so far for

43:48.376 --> 43:50.176
any of the boats.

43:50.178 --> 43:53.245
It puts us that much closer
to winning back that title

43:53.248 --> 43:55.848
we won so many years before.

43:55.917 --> 43:57.684
We're ready for it.
