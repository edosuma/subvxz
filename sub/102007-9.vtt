00:01.469 --> 00:03.237
I don't want any
surprises out there today.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.642
"9-1-1 Lone
Star," all new Mondays.

00:08.742 --> 00:12.613
And check out our other Fox
shows "9-1-1," "Prodigal Son,"

00:12.680 --> 00:15.949
and "The Resident," only on Fox.

00:18.952 --> 00:21.455
This is a bad idea, Cal.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.857
This is a mint condition
'91 chick magnet.

00:23.957 --> 00:26.960
It'd be a crime for it to just
sit here all summer long.

00:27.095 --> 00:28.196
Crime is gonna be us driving it.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.630
Would you stop being
such a baby?

00:29.763 --> 00:31.965
Just imagine us
cruising the strip in this,

00:32.100 --> 00:33.201
past all
those high school girls?

00:33.301 --> 00:34.702
It'll be so fly.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.704
Until they see we're
a couple of 12-year-olds.

00:36.804 --> 00:41.309
You look at least 14, and
I read at an 11th grade level.

00:43.977 --> 00:45.546
So that's a problem.

00:49.983 --> 00:53.287

He's challenging our manhood.

01:16.344 --> 01:17.745
We don't got no manhood, dummy!

01:17.845 --> 01:20.714
Yeah, but the girls

02:59.647 --> 03:02.416
Judd?

03:05.486 --> 03:07.788
Judd, you ready, baby?

03:07.855 --> 03:09.790
I'm two buttons away.

03:09.857 --> 03:13.461
-Ooh, Lordy,
it smells good in here.
-Mm-hmm.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.630
Hey, Daddy, we're about
to step out the door.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.165
<i>Well, step back in.</i>

03:18.299 --> 03:20.268
<i>There's bad weather</i>
coming through.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.969
Now, Dad, don't you even start.

03:22.102 --> 03:24.171
It's your birthday, you just
got your second vaccination,

03:24.305 --> 03:25.973
and you haven't seen your son
in almost a year now.

03:26.106 --> 03:28.509
-All right, we're coming.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.011
<i>But you know the first question-</i>
your father's

03:31.144 --> 03:32.780
-gonna ask us when we get there.
-Be about when

03:32.846 --> 03:34.114
we're gonna be ready
to give him some grandbabies?

03:34.181 --> 03:37.551
-Uh, that's the one.
-Yes, I know.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.787
How you gonna dance your way
out of it this time?

03:39.853 --> 03:41.889
I was thinking maybe we don't
dance out of it this time.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.325
I think it's about time
we give him some.

04:02.510 --> 04:06.347
Judd? Judd?
Judd, wake up, sweetie.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.015
Judd?

04:15.656 --> 04:17.991
All right, Harkes,
kill that siren.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.227
What does it mean
when you hear a siren?

04:20.361 --> 04:21.929
Pull over
to the side of the road!

04:22.029 --> 04:25.399
Sure, but what it really,
really means is

04:25.533 --> 04:27.668
that help is on the way. Yeah?

04:27.735 --> 04:30.003
Who wants to take a guess
at why we call...

04:30.070 --> 04:32.373
...this one the ladder truck?

04:32.440 --> 04:35.108
-'Cause there's a ladder.
-What is this?
This the honors class?

04:35.208 --> 04:37.878
Actually, we don't have
honors class in Bible Camp.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.448
-Maybe you should.

04:40.548 --> 04:41.549
Right here,
I'd like to introduce you

04:41.615 --> 04:42.850
to Firefighter Garrity.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.018
He's wearing all
of the protective gear.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.220
Now, this is how
we stay safe in a fire.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.023
Helmet protects the old dome,
steel-toed boots

04:50.090 --> 04:52.192
ensures we keep
ten little piggies,

04:52.259 --> 04:55.596
and this mask lets us breathe
through heavy smoke.

04:55.729 --> 04:58.932
Okay, so, anybody have
any questions today? Sir.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.034
Why did you become
a firefighter?

05:01.101 --> 05:03.771
Because he didn't want
to write a college essay.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.906
-Or graduate high school.
-Ah.

05:05.973 --> 05:09.242
Well, 'cause
it's the best job in the world.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.745
There's nothing... nothing
better than saving lives.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.415
Anybody else? Anybody? No?

05:14.548 --> 05:16.550
I guess that about wraps it up.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.752
So one last time--
if there's an emergency,

05:18.819 --> 05:20.454
what number do you call?

05:20.588 --> 05:22.255
911!

05:22.390 --> 05:23.591
Boom! Very good.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.593
Over here, cowboys and cowgirls.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.260
Thank you for having us.

05:27.395 --> 05:28.929
May I leave these with you?

05:29.062 --> 05:31.231
We run a prayer hotline at
the church, for those in crisis

05:31.298 --> 05:33.934
-or who just need
a friendly ear.
-I strike you

05:34.001 --> 05:35.503
as somebody
that needs praying for?

05:35.603 --> 05:37.505
All you brave men here,
given what you see every day,

05:37.605 --> 05:40.240
might be nice to have a number
other than 911 to call.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.743
It's tough to argue that.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.278
-God bless you.
-God bless you. Thanks so much.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.114
-Oh!

05:47.180 --> 05:49.349
-Oh! Gotta go, gotta go!

05:49.450 --> 05:51.018
Guys. This way.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.461
-Captain Vega. Good to see you.
-Captain Braxton. Hey, Juddy.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.929
-What's up, T?
-What do we know?

06:01.995 --> 06:03.431
Neighbors called 911.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.833
They said they heard someone
yelling for help inside.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.669
-Ryder, take the door.
-Yup, you got it, Cap.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.771
Ooh! Watch that!

06:10.838 --> 06:12.873
Hey, coming in!

06:12.973 --> 06:15.375
Hello? Austin EMS.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.678
In here! Dining room!

06:17.811 --> 06:19.880
-Oh, thank you for coming.
-Hey.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.850
We're here to help you now.
I'm Tommy.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.052
-What's your name?
-Leigh-Anne.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.987
-How did you fall?
-How many old ladies

06:27.120 --> 06:28.722
does it take
to change a light bulb?

06:28.822 --> 06:30.157
Oh, I see you got jokes.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.860
-Where does it hurt?
-My shoulder and back.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.629
-Okay. Let's see. All right.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.064
I think you may have
fractured your shoulder.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.833
We're gonna put a C-collar
on you, just to be safe.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.169
Is there anyone
you'd like us to call?

06:42.302 --> 06:43.837
There's no one.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.338
All right. Firefighters,

06:45.473 --> 06:47.675
can you help me get
this nice lady on the gurney?

06:47.808 --> 06:51.011
-Judd, grab her legs.
-Yup.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.013
-I got one.
No!

06:53.146 --> 06:55.182
No! G-Get him away from me!

06:55.315 --> 06:59.086
Keep your hands off me!
I don't want him in my house!

06:59.186 --> 07:02.189
Get out! Get out!

07:02.322 --> 07:05.893
Get out!

07:08.729 --> 07:11.198
Just leave me here.
That's not an option.

07:11.331 --> 07:14.535
-One, two, three.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.770
Okay.

07:40.894 --> 07:41.795
<i>Oh, this is so cool.</i>

07:41.895 --> 07:43.230
<i>We actually did it.</i>

07:45.398 --> 07:46.767
Hell yeah! Let's dust 'em!

07:47.701 --> 07:50.203
-Son!

07:51.572 --> 07:52.606
<i>Come on!</i>

07:52.740 --> 07:53.807
Yeah!

07:53.907 --> 07:56.409
<i>Judd, come on, come on!</i>

08:15.596 --> 08:17.798
Cal, I'm sorry, brother.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.336
-I'm so sorry.

08:41.321 --> 08:44.457
<i>Prayer in Crisis,</i>
how may I help you today?

08:46.493 --> 08:47.928
<i>Hello?</i>

08:49.830 --> 08:51.865
<i>Hello?</i>

08:54.768 --> 08:59.372
Well, you just take your time.
Uh... I'm right here.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.841
I apologize.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.476
I don't even know
why I dialed this number.

09:03.611 --> 09:06.046
You want to tell me your name?

09:06.146 --> 09:08.616
I'd just make something up.

09:08.682 --> 09:11.051
<i>That's fair enough.</i>
How about I call you John?

09:11.151 --> 09:13.721
That's as good as any.

09:13.821 --> 09:16.123
You said you don't know why
you made this call tonight.

09:16.189 --> 09:20.160
Do you think maybe it's, uh,
because you were led to?

09:21.194 --> 09:22.462
<i>Hey, look, I'm sorry.</i>

09:22.529 --> 09:23.664
I thought maybe
I was in some kind of

09:23.797 --> 09:25.833
a confessional mood, but,

09:25.966 --> 09:28.401
I-I ain't really
much of a talker

09:28.501 --> 09:31.138
-when it comes right down to it.
-That's okay.

09:31.204 --> 09:34.041
You don't have to say anything
if you don't want to.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.677
God knows what's
on your heart anyway.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.979
Can't hide from God.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.814
-<i>eah. He surely sees everything.
-Y</i>

09:40.881 --> 09:45.018
Can't even hide from yourself
in the end, although...

09:45.085 --> 09:47.187
I thought I could.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.322
<i>I've been doing</i>
a pretty fair job of it

09:49.389 --> 09:51.659
<i>for about ten years, you know.</i>

09:51.725 --> 09:53.193
Hiding behind the uniform

09:53.326 --> 09:56.429
and pretending that
that uniform was me, but...

09:56.529 --> 09:58.031
but it ain't.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.033
You in the military, John?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.369
<i>Oh, no. Hell no.</i>
I ain't brave enough for that.

10:02.502 --> 10:04.237
I'm a firefighter.

10:04.371 --> 10:07.207
Well, I think most people would
consider that quite brave.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.042
<i>They'd be right mostly, but...</i>

10:09.176 --> 10:12.045
no, I ain't no hero.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.513
And today I got seen.

10:13.580 --> 10:17.284
<i>My uniform gave me away.</i>
It gave me away

10:17.384 --> 10:21.689
'cause I had my stupid name
stitched right on it.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.390
I don't understand.

10:23.523 --> 10:26.059
<i>My fire company got sent out</i>
on this call today,

10:26.193 --> 10:29.930
and the lady we were
supposed to help...

10:30.063 --> 10:33.400
turned out to be, uh,
someone I used to know,

10:33.533 --> 10:36.737
and someone who I hurt

10:36.870 --> 10:38.605
<i>a long time ago.</i>

10:38.739 --> 10:40.908
<i>So long ago</i>
that I forgot about it,

10:41.041 --> 10:44.644
but, uh, she didn't.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.113
And she can't.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.982
Well, maybe God was
giving you an opportunity

10:49.082 --> 10:50.583
to make amends.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.252
Well, you know what,
that's a piss-poor opportunity,

10:52.385 --> 10:54.454
if it is one, 'cause there ain't
gonna be no amends,

10:54.587 --> 10:56.790
'cause that woman would just
as soon spit in my face

10:56.924 --> 10:58.625
as forgive me.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.494
Well, then, maybe you should
let her spit in your face.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.831
-Oh, that's really your advice?
-It was to give her

11:03.931 --> 11:06.734
an opportunity to forgive you.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.802
<i>But also</i>

11:08.936 --> 11:11.972
be willing to be spit on.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.409
It's sure as hell
no more than I deserve.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.678
<i>It's no more than</i>
any of us deserve, John.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.014
"Let me never be ashamed.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.450
<i>"Deliver me in thy</i>
righteousness.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.318
<i>"You protect the faithful</i>
and reward

11:25.452 --> 11:28.822
the good-doers as long as
they trust in you."

11:28.956 --> 11:31.992
<i>That's Psalms 31.</i>

11:32.125 --> 11:35.162
None of us are perfect.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.966
It's by grace that we're saved.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.270
And my name's not John,
it's Judd.

11:43.336 --> 11:46.306
Okay. Well, you sure
you're not making that up?

11:46.373 --> 11:49.376
-No, ma'am.
-Okay.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.845
<i>Well, it's very nice</i>
to meet you, Judd.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.114
My name's Grace.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.118
Well, now who's making it up?

11:58.185 --> 12:00.320
<i>Judd. Judd!</i>

12:00.453 --> 12:02.655
Judd, can you hear me, babe?
Please wake up.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.724
Judd!

12:07.494 --> 12:10.630
Baby, wake up.
I need you to wake up.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.168
Judd, we were in an accident.
We're in the river, babe.

12:15.302 --> 12:18.505
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're gonna be all right.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.240
I'm gonna knock that window out,
we're gonna swim to the surface.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.674
It'll be easy-peasy, okay?

12:21.809 --> 12:23.543
Judd, my legs are stuck.

12:23.676 --> 12:26.046
I can't move.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.689
-That's not gonna work.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.692
Come on, this could work. It'll
work if I can get it to move.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.029
-Judd...
-Just one inch!

12:43.696 --> 12:45.032
Wait, it's...

12:45.165 --> 12:46.499
Judd, it's time to go.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.368
-I ain't going without you.
-Judd,

12:48.501 --> 12:50.437
I will always be
by your side.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.039
-Grace, Grace, Grace,
you're damn right.
-Oh, please.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.740
You're gonna be
right by my side because

12:53.874 --> 12:55.408
-wherever you are,
that's where I am, too.
-Oh, Judd...

12:55.542 --> 12:57.110
And that's the deal, right?
Right?

12:57.210 --> 12:58.711
That's the deal,
right to the end.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.547
Judd, you have to go.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.182
I can't move!

13:02.249 --> 13:04.918
You have to go.

<i>-It is.</i>
-It's Judd.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.540
<i>-Uh, we spoke the other night.</i>
-I remember.

13:27.607 --> 13:28.909
You sound better.

-<i>'m-I'm feeling a little better,

13:31.711 --> 13:35.415
I'm fixing to either
make amends or get spit at.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.450
Well, I'm pleased to hear it.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.153
<i>I just wanted to thank you.</i>
I think you got a real gift,

13:40.253 --> 13:44.391
-and, uh, I appreciate you
sharing it with me.
-Well, it's my pleasure.

13:44.457 --> 13:47.260
And if you ever need me again,
you have the number, okay?

13:47.327 --> 13:49.897
Careful now, 'cause I just might
take you up on that.

Hey, Judd, how you doing?

13:59.940 --> 14:03.243
Oh, I don't know, I-I think
I'm feeling kind of blue.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.012
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.746
-Um, did something happen?
-No.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.282
It's just more of, like,
a general malaise, I guess.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.684
-A general malaise?
-Well, now, look,

14:11.784 --> 14:13.586
the-the truth is, uh...

14:13.653 --> 14:15.322
I think I just wanted
to hear your voice.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.857
Judd, this is a prayer line.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.260
<i>I know. And I just prayed</i>
that you'd pick up.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.629

it's working, right?

hit two balls

how's that even possible?

17:26.979 --> 17:29.149
But I'm gonna give one anyway.
God said to build each other up,

17:29.282 --> 17:31.984

you guys have done for me.

a particular reason

17:44.297 --> 17:47.700

by a lightning bolt?

17:47.834 --> 17:50.703
Which one?
Uh, the one in the tank top?

17:50.837 --> 17:52.004
No, no...

17:52.071 --> 17:53.340
Uh-oh.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.044
-All right, come on, let's go.
-What do you mean,

17:58.178 --> 18:00.180
-let's go? What are you doing?
Come on. Let's go.
-Come on.

Hi. I'm so sorry

18:09.021 --> 18:10.190
Hi.

18:10.257 --> 18:13.526
Judd, speak.

18:16.028 --> 18:19.899
Howdy. I'm Judd.

18:20.032 --> 18:23.002
Hi...

18:23.069 --> 18:26.606
Judd, uh... I'm Grace.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.376
You're so tall.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.511
You are so beautiful.

18:32.545 --> 18:35.882
Ask the girl to dance, Judd.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.886
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I...

18:39.952 --> 18:42.789
-Go.
-Yeah.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.395
What are the chances?

18:48.528 --> 18:50.363
Honestly, Judd, I'm not sure

18:50.430 --> 18:52.299
chance, uh,
had much to do with it.

18:52.399 --> 18:53.900
I don't think so, either.

18:54.033 --> 18:58.871
So, uh, you don't work
for the prayer hotline no more.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.473
Uh, I don't.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.575
-Mm-hmm.
-I'm sorry. Uh...

19:02.709 --> 19:04.611
I just-- I didn't know
how to tell you, I guess.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.413
Oh, no, no, no,
you don't owe me nothing.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.315
You're not gonna believe this,
but I just tried

19:08.415 --> 19:10.049
to call you not ten minutes ago.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.150
-No way.
-Mm-hmm.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.419
For what?

19:12.485 --> 19:14.053
I didn't get spit on.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.722
She forgave me.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.557
Ah.

19:17.624 --> 19:20.627
Judd, that's the most
wonderful thing I've heard ever.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.462
You changed my life.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.498
So, you know,
it's got me thinking

19:25.598 --> 19:27.234
if that's the sort of miracle

19:27.300 --> 19:29.101
that you can work
over the phone,

19:29.236 --> 19:32.605
-imagine what you could do,
uh, in person.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.509
Judd, the reason I quiet is, uh,

19:36.609 --> 19:38.278
is 'cause I'm moving.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.179
Moving where?

19:40.280 --> 19:41.848
Georgetown.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.584
They have a graduate school
for global policy,

19:44.651 --> 19:46.619
and I found out I got in.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.688
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.958
-Yeah, I-I knew you was
a smart cookie.
-Oh...

19:53.493 --> 19:57.129
So, how, uh...
how'd Friday be, then?

19:57.264 --> 20:00.800
You're not hearing the words
I'm saying, sir.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.135
I leave at the end
of the summer.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.172
It doesn't make sense to start
anything new right now.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.874
I feel like we already
started something.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.677
I feel like I'm dreaming, Judd.

20:10.810 --> 20:15.648
If I'm dreaming,
I don't want to wake up.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.317
Judd?

20:17.450 --> 20:19.051
Where am I?

20:21.053 --> 20:22.989
Where am I?

20:23.055 --> 20:25.024
-West Park Memorial.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.528
There was an accident.

20:29.996 --> 20:33.733
Where's Grace?
Where's my wife?

20:33.833 --> 20:35.802
Cap, where's my girl at?

20:42.041 --> 20:43.843
It was six minutes, T.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.312
She was pinned underwater
for six minutes

20:45.378 --> 20:46.846
before Swiftwater Rescue
got to us.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.548
I know.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.650
You can get brain damage
in four.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.319
You can, you can.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.387
But there have been people
that have been under for seven,

20:54.521 --> 20:57.189
even eight minutes without
permanent brain damage.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.192
The water was cold.

21:00.327 --> 21:02.228
That worked in her favor.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.066
I couldn't get her
out of there, man.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.501
I wasn't strong enough.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.670
-I couldn't save her,
I couldn't lift her.
-Judd...

21:10.737 --> 21:12.772
I got spooked.

21:12.872 --> 21:16.242
I saw the-the lights coming
and I shouldn't have swerved

21:16.376 --> 21:17.877
the truck into a river.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.078
Judd!

21:19.211 --> 21:21.180
Do you really think
either one of you

21:21.247 --> 21:22.582
would be coming out
of this better

21:22.715 --> 21:24.250
after a head-on collision?

21:26.419 --> 21:28.220
Is she coming out of it?

21:31.057 --> 21:32.892
Listen to me. Listen.
Look at me.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.194
Okay, we have to be positive
about this, right?

21:38.230 --> 21:39.566
All right.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.068
She's alive.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.937
She's a fighter.

21:45.071 --> 21:46.473
She laid you out.

21:46.573 --> 21:48.975
-With one punch.
-One punch.

21:49.075 --> 21:53.580
Don't you dare underestimate
our girl.

21:53.713 --> 21:56.383
I never have.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.585
<i>No, I'm serious.</i>
Smarty-pants here

21:58.651 --> 21:59.919
is about to be taking courses

22:00.052 --> 22:01.588
that I couldn't even pronounce

22:01.721 --> 22:03.956
without getting my tongue
tied up in a knot.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.725
First of all,
he is exaggerating, y'all.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.093
No, no, I'm not.

22:07.226 --> 22:10.930
What's-what's the one?
The Globalization...

22:11.063 --> 22:15.735
of Emerging Intercourse
Relations.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.837
-I'm pretty sure
that's not right.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.640
The Globalization of Emerging

22:20.773 --> 22:22.442
Intersocietal Relations.

22:22.509 --> 22:23.443
I mean, was impressed

22:23.576 --> 22:25.244

22:25.311 --> 22:26.946
T's right. This is,
this is impressive.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.281
It's Georgetown, right?
Bill Clinton went there.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.950
LBJ went there.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.919
Tommy, can we talk about
something else now, please?

22:32.985 --> 22:34.921
Aw, look--
oh, look how cute she is,

22:34.987 --> 22:36.623
trying to avoid the spotlight.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.925
Well, then,
maybe we should just

22:38.991 --> 22:40.326
swing the spotlight
over this way.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.694
-What?
Let's go.

22:41.794 --> 22:44.531
Okay.
-What do you say, my love?

22:44.631 --> 22:46.198
Charles.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.801
Uh, okay-- okay.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.704
Um, well, all right, then.
Uh, guess what.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.473
I got myself knocked up.

22:53.606 --> 22:56.543
-Tommy, stop it.

22:56.643 --> 22:57.710
Y'all are pregnant for real?

22:57.810 --> 22:59.479
-Yeah. Yeah.
-For real?

22:59.612 --> 23:01.848
-Oh, my gosh!
-Yo.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.683
Come here. Come here, come here.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.351
Oh, my God.

23:05.485 --> 23:06.986
I know, it's crazy right?

23:07.119 --> 23:09.789
♪ <i>A brand-new day...</i> ♪

23:09.856 --> 23:11.858
Oh, hey, I hope you don't mind,

23:11.991 --> 23:13.893
but you might be
getting a phone call.

23:13.993 --> 23:16.028
I put you down as a reference.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.163
For what?

23:17.229 --> 23:21.067
Well... with some firehouses
in D.C.

23:21.167 --> 23:23.503
D.C.? So you're going with her?

23:23.570 --> 23:27.006
Oh, no, no. I'm just kicking
the tires for now.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.741
So you haven't told Grace?

23:28.841 --> 23:30.176
There's nothing to tell yet.
You know?

23:30.242 --> 23:32.512
Plus, it's, like,
there's a very fine line

23:32.579 --> 23:35.214
between romantic and creepy.

23:35.347 --> 23:38.050
We've only been doing this
for two months.

23:38.184 --> 23:40.720
Well, she looks
pretty smitten to me.

23:40.853 --> 23:44.557
It's summer, man.
Everybody's smitten.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.693
What about you?

23:46.826 --> 23:49.696
You sure
you're just not... smitten?

23:51.531 --> 23:53.399
No, sir.

23:53.533 --> 23:56.168
I'm in love.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.740
She looks like an angel
when she sleeps.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.742
Yes.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.277
Since she was a baby.

24:05.377 --> 24:08.047
Y'all really did give her
the perfect name.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.282
The second this girl
came into the world,

24:10.382 --> 24:13.720
you could just feel the Spirit
radiating off of her.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.387
Yes, Lord.

24:15.522 --> 24:17.724
Always so sweet,

24:17.857 --> 24:20.760
never thinking about herself,
always others.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.428
Yeah, that'd be my wife.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.798
Food's here.

24:29.869 --> 24:32.038
There he is.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.706
Hey, Judd.
You look good.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.441
How you feeling?

24:35.575 --> 24:38.545
Uh, I feel like-like my truck
that got hit by a river.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.713
-Oh, Cap.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.815
Good to see you, man.
Oh, well, oh.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.817
Look at all this good grub
y'all brought, too. Wow.

24:44.917 --> 24:45.985
We didn't really know
what to get,

24:46.085 --> 24:47.920
so we sort of got everything.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.589
That-that's all right.
I'm, you know,

24:49.722 --> 24:51.090
I'm in the mood for everything,

24:51.223 --> 24:52.424
so, wow.

24:52.559 --> 24:54.594
Thank you. I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get, uh...

24:54.727 --> 24:58.097
This is Gracie's favorite,
so I'm gonna cut a little piece

24:58.230 --> 24:59.832
for Grace.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.269
So that, uh...

25:04.336 --> 25:06.272
...when she, when she,
when she wakes up,

25:06.338 --> 25:08.274
just-- she's probably
gonna have a big appetite.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.442
So I'll just keep it here...

25:10.577 --> 25:12.444
Just...

25:12.579 --> 25:14.747
I'll just, uh...

25:20.186 --> 25:23.355
Thank you guys for being,
for being here, you know.

25:23.455 --> 25:26.926
For the both of us,
thank you very much.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.833
-We doing a group one?

25:33.966 --> 25:36.268
Mm-hmm.
All right, we got you.

25:36.335 --> 25:38.971
Thank you.
We got to do
the same for our own.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.039
Thank you.

25:40.139 --> 25:42.642
Hey, Reyes.

25:42.709 --> 25:45.978
Hey, Banks. Carter.
What are you guys doing here?

25:46.045 --> 25:47.546
Had to interview some drunk
who plowed

25:47.647 --> 25:49.649
his SUV into a convenience store
this morning.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.217
Look like the same guy
may have ran

25:51.317 --> 25:53.119
some folks off the Lamar Bridge
last night.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.320
Wait, he's here?

25:54.386 --> 25:56.022
Yeah. Banged up his leg.

25:56.155 --> 25:58.791
Other than that, nothing else,
not a scratch.

25:58.858 --> 26:02.061
Drunks, right?
All right, see you around.

26:02.161 --> 26:05.231
Hey. You good?

26:06.733 --> 26:08.167
I'm g-- No, I'm good.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.736
I'm good, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:09.836 --> 26:12.171
It's in the Lord's hands now.
He knows what he's doing.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.341
Yes, sir.

26:23.182 --> 26:24.483
-Hey, Judd.
-Hey, Mr. Williams.

26:24.550 --> 26:25.885
Uh, I'm supposed to pick up
Grace for a date.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.253
Yeah, she's, uh,
still getting ready.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.187
Come on in.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.588
You know, my wife is gonna hate

26:29.689 --> 26:30.757
that she missed you.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.692
-Here.
Thank you.

26:32.825 --> 26:36.696
You know, she's, uh, she's grown
quite fond of you, Judd.

26:36.829 --> 26:39.031
Well, we both have.

26:39.165 --> 26:41.433
We can tell how much
you care about our daughter.

26:41.533 --> 26:44.103
Well, I mean, I-I know
it ain't-- it hasn't been,

26:44.203 --> 26:47.874
uh, more than,
well, I guess, a few months,

26:48.007 --> 26:51.010
but, uh, I love her, sir.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.112
Well, I guess we finally
found something

26:53.212 --> 26:54.681
that we both have in common.

26:54.747 --> 26:56.716
Amen. How about that?

26:56.783 --> 26:59.686
I appreciate it. Oh, man.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.854
-Mmm.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.422
Holy smokes, that's good tea.

27:03.555 --> 27:05.357
Yeah, that's
my great-granddaddy's recipe.

27:05.424 --> 27:09.361
You know, he was a, uh,
sharecropper in South Carolina.

27:09.428 --> 27:12.865
That man broke his back
every day

27:12.932 --> 27:14.466
so that his children could be

27:14.566 --> 27:17.569
the first in his line
to finish elementary school.

27:17.704 --> 27:19.105
Two generations later,

27:19.238 --> 27:22.441
my mother marched in Selma
with Dr. King.

27:22.574 --> 27:24.076
To fight for my future.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.979
-That's an incredible legacy.
-Yes, it is.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.081
Yes, it is, and I've spent
every day of my life

27:29.148 --> 27:30.817
trying to live up to it.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.419
My question to you, son,

27:33.485 --> 27:35.154
is...

27:35.254 --> 27:38.424
what are you willing
to sacrifice for my daughter?

27:38.490 --> 27:40.092
Whatever it takes.

27:40.226 --> 27:42.428
I was hoping you would say that.

27:43.930 --> 27:46.298
You see, for generations,

27:46.432 --> 27:49.736
this family has been marching
toward its destiny.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.603
But I'm afraid

27:51.738 --> 27:56.108
that that can't happen
if you're a part of it.

28:01.580 --> 28:02.949
Okay.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.350
Uh...

28:04.450 --> 28:08.654
What it comes down to
is I am the wrong color.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.522
Oh, no, no, no, no.

28:10.622 --> 28:14.360
I'm not talking about
the color of your skin, Judd.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.929
I'm talking about the color
of your collar.

28:16.996 --> 28:19.665
Now, don't get me wrong.

28:19.799 --> 28:22.134
I admire what you do, Judd.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.336
But Gracie is special.

28:24.470 --> 28:27.506
I mean, she has a chance
to go out and change the world.

28:27.639 --> 28:30.209
I-In ways that
my great-granddaddy

28:30.309 --> 28:32.511
couldn't have even imagined.

28:32.644 --> 28:36.816
She's meant
for great things, Judd.

28:36.949 --> 28:39.051
Big things.

28:39.151 --> 28:43.823
Yeah. All I want
is what's best for her.

28:43.956 --> 28:48.227
And that's why I have no doubt
you'll do the right thing.

28:52.731 --> 28:53.665
Hey, y'all.

28:53.732 --> 28:54.967
Hey, there she is.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.869
Well, ain't you
looking beautiful?

28:57.003 --> 29:00.406
Ugh, Daddy.
You say that every time.

29:00.506 --> 29:02.708
Judd, I'm sorry
I'm running a little late.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.344
No, it was worth the wait. Uh...

29:05.411 --> 29:07.346
Your daddy's right.

29:07.413 --> 29:10.182

Grace.

what's your hurry, cowboy?

29:24.230 --> 29:26.365
Well, I mean, we're here,
ain't we?

29:26.498 --> 29:28.734
Well, the dance floor's
not going anywhere.

29:28.868 --> 29:32.204
No, I know, but, you know,

29:32.271 --> 29:35.374
your, uh, your dance card's
only got a couple dances

29:35.441 --> 29:37.243
left on it before
you got to go, so...

29:37.376 --> 29:39.278
Hmm. What would you say
if I told you

29:39.378 --> 29:40.880
we could have
as many dances we wanted?

29:41.013 --> 29:42.714
Well, how's that?

29:42.849 --> 29:45.217
Well, I think maybe
I don't leave next month, Judd.

29:46.252 --> 29:48.955
I think maybe I stay here.

29:49.055 --> 29:51.858
What about Georgetown?

29:51.924 --> 29:54.726
I don't think Georgetown
is for me.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.228
-Gracie... Gr...
-No, well,

29:56.295 --> 29:58.730
before you say anything,
so there's no confusion,

29:58.797 --> 30:02.068
I've been thinking
about this for a while, Judd.

30:02.134 --> 30:05.037
Before you and I even met.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.908
I mean, but why-why would you
want to give up

30:08.975 --> 30:10.376
a great opportunity like that?

30:10.442 --> 30:13.779
You was, you... was gonna go
make a difference.

30:13.913 --> 30:17.383
Well, who says I can't
make a difference right here?

30:18.750 --> 30:21.320
I watch you do it.
Every single day. And Tommy.

30:21.420 --> 30:24.090
Yeah, me and Tommy
didn't get into a school

30:24.223 --> 30:26.792
with a three percent
acceptance rate.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.394
I understand, Judd,

30:28.460 --> 30:29.962
but you weren't the only person
that I met

30:30.096 --> 30:31.430
while working those phones.

30:31.563 --> 30:34.100
Judd, I really feel
like I met myself.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.102
Talking to people
and connecting...

30:36.168 --> 30:37.436
You're gonna go to Georgetown.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.771
Okay? You're gonna be something.

that's that. That's...

30:42.508 --> 30:44.476
-That's that.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.612
Judd, I love you.

30:47.446 --> 30:50.282
I loved you before I met you.

30:50.349 --> 30:51.918

31:30.356 --> 31:32.024
Will you let me
just take you home?

31:32.158 --> 31:34.160
Well, I don't know what makes
you think I'm going home.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.162

32:55.274 --> 32:56.575
You got to be kidding me.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.110
You parked it in front
of a fire hydrant,

32:58.244 --> 33:00.579
so the police will send you
your ticket, all right?

33:00.712 --> 33:02.081

33:02.148 --> 33:03.882
You could have at least
let me open the door.

33:03.949 --> 33:05.484
-Yeah, I guess I could have.
-I want your name,

33:05.584 --> 33:07.453
you son of a bitch.
You're paying for this.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.221
I tell you what, why don't
you call my office, okay?

33:09.288 --> 33:11.090
You got a pen? The number's 911.

33:11.223 --> 33:13.259
-I'm calling my lawyer.
-Good, you're gonna need
a lawyer

33:13.392 --> 33:14.593
if you don't get out of my way.

33:14.726 --> 33:15.927
'Cause if you interfere
with public duty,

33:16.062 --> 33:17.263
that's a felony in Texas.

33:17.396 --> 33:18.730
Enjoy your power trip now.

33:18.797 --> 33:20.599
Because tomorrow,
when you wake up,

33:20.666 --> 33:23.502
you'll still be
a sad little fireman.

33:24.303 --> 33:25.771
Hey, hey, hey!

33:26.772 --> 33:28.340
Easy, easy!

33:28.440 --> 33:30.242
-Break it up.
I'm good, good, good.

33:30.309 --> 33:33.145
I'm good. Y'all got him?
Oh, man, man, man.

33:33.279 --> 33:35.181
Me? Me? It's me.

33:41.087 --> 33:43.622
Um, I'm sorry you had to come
all the way out here.

33:43.689 --> 33:46.992
No, that's exactly what I wanted
to do with my day.

33:47.126 --> 33:51.197
Spend some quality time with
my son and his bail bondsman.

33:51.297 --> 33:52.664
What the hell
were you thinking about?

33:52.798 --> 33:54.700
I was-- I-I was trying
to fight a fire.

33:54.800 --> 33:57.303
I didn't know I had to fight
some douchebag, too.

33:57.369 --> 34:02.141
You know, the only thing smart
about you anymore is that mouth.

34:02.208 --> 34:05.377
Do you realize that you could've
flushed your whole life

34:05.477 --> 34:07.379
down the toilet bowl?

34:07.479 --> 34:09.548
Oh, police told me
that the other guy

34:09.648 --> 34:11.883
ain't gonna press charges
'cause he'd be facing a felony.

34:11.983 --> 34:14.853
What about your Cap?
And those guys you work with?

34:14.986 --> 34:17.989
It'll be a month of KP
and latrine duty

34:18.056 --> 34:20.326
and then-- and...
I mean, they'll get over it.

34:20.392 --> 34:21.727
You think the only one
you're hurting

34:21.827 --> 34:24.396
doing all this
is yourself, don't you?

34:25.397 --> 34:27.666
Well, unless you straighten
your ass out,

34:27.733 --> 34:30.469
you're gonna hurt
somebody real bad,

34:30.536 --> 34:33.839
and I'm not gonna be there
to tell you it's okay.

34:39.010 --> 34:41.380
Oh, uh, hey.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.182
Hey, man, I think
you're in the wrong room?

34:43.249 --> 34:45.083
I think I got
the wrong building.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.186
I bet neither one of us

34:47.253 --> 34:49.855
expected to find ourselves
in the hospital today, right?

34:49.988 --> 34:52.858
But then we both got
your dumb ass to thank for that.

34:52.991 --> 34:54.426
All right,
you shouldn't be in here...

34:54.526 --> 34:56.862
-If you touch the phone,

34:56.995 --> 34:58.597
if you cry out,
I'm-a snap your wrist.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.098
-Okay. Okay.
-Got it?

35:00.199 --> 35:01.167
Okay. Yes.

35:01.233 --> 35:02.168
What's your name?

35:02.234 --> 35:03.702
It's, uh, it's-it's Caleb.

35:03.835 --> 35:05.271
It's C-Caleb, Caleb Wilson.

35:05.371 --> 35:07.005
-Caleb?
-Yeah.

35:07.072 --> 35:09.875
I heard you plowed through a
convenience store this morning.

35:10.742 --> 35:13.412
What-what were you
gonna pick up?

35:13.545 --> 35:16.047
What? What? What do you,
what do you mean? Uh...

35:16.114 --> 35:18.217
You know, at the store?
They got things to buy?

35:18.284 --> 35:19.618
-What'd you hope to buy?
-Oh, yeah, um...

35:19.718 --> 35:21.620
-What? Baby wipes or a soda?
-Ow, ow, no.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.222
-No, I was just,
I was gonna get...
-Lotto tickets?

35:23.355 --> 35:26.057
I was gonna get, I was just
gonna get, like, a churro.

35:26.124 --> 35:29.027
-And a hot chocolate.
-You got a sweet tooth?

35:29.094 --> 35:30.596
-Yeah.
-Me, too.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.598
Let me ask you, though, Caleb.

35:32.731 --> 35:36.202
How-how, how is it that a man

35:36.268 --> 35:38.404
could run two people off a road,

35:38.470 --> 35:39.805
and then just leave them
to drown

35:39.905 --> 35:42.073
and then wake-wake up
and think to himself,

35:42.140 --> 35:43.609
"I think I'd like a churro"?

35:43.742 --> 35:45.777
All right, listen, man,
listen, um,

35:45.911 --> 35:47.413
I don't even,

35:47.546 --> 35:49.248
I don't even, like,
remember yesterday.

35:49.315 --> 35:53.051
You know, like, the truck
or the river or-or nothing.

35:53.118 --> 35:56.288
I'm sorry, I have a problem.
I have, I have a problem.

35:56.422 --> 35:58.790
-You have a problem. Yeah.
-Yes, I have a problem.

35:58.924 --> 36:00.726
-You do have a problem.

36:00.792 --> 36:05.564
My wife Grace
is the best person I've known.

36:07.299 --> 36:08.934
Her life's work is saving lives.

36:09.067 --> 36:11.270
Her life's work
is saving people.

36:11.337 --> 36:14.773
-Yeah.
-If she saved one life
per shift--

36:14.840 --> 36:18.076
and that's conservative--
then by my estimation

36:18.143 --> 36:20.579
she's saved 2,250 lives.

36:20.646 --> 36:23.349
-She saved 2,251...
-Mm. Mm-hmm.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.617
-...if you want to count me.

36:25.684 --> 36:29.154
Right? Which is a life
she's saved numerable times.

36:29.288 --> 36:31.323
So...

36:31.457 --> 36:34.593
if a piece of trash like you
gets to snuff her out

36:34.660 --> 36:35.994
and live, what does that mean?

36:36.127 --> 36:38.029
-What does that mean?

36:38.129 --> 36:40.632
-What does...
Judd, that's enough.
Let him go.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.200
Why? This is what he deserves.

36:42.301 --> 36:43.302
Because Gracie's awake, son.

36:43.369 --> 36:45.103
She's awake, Judd.

36:45.170 --> 36:47.473
And the first person
she asked for was you.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.341
She needs you, son.

36:49.475 --> 36:51.810
Hey. Hey, hey. Hey.

36:56.482 --> 36:58.850
Grace just saved your life, too.

36:58.984 --> 37:01.520
She just saved your life, too.

37:29.315 --> 37:30.682
Hey, girl.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.851
-Hello, my love.
-Hey.

37:32.984 --> 37:35.521
You gave us a scare there
for a minute.

37:35.654 --> 37:37.689
You know I wasn't going
anywhere, Judd.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.325
Wherever you are,

37:39.391 --> 37:41.860
that's where I'm-a be.
That's the deal, right?

37:41.993 --> 37:43.429
That's the deal.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.731
-Yeah.

37:45.864 --> 37:47.399
Mrs. Ryder,
I think you might be

37:47.533 --> 37:50.068
the most popular patient
I've ever had.

37:50.201 --> 37:52.738
Your well-wishers are becoming
a fire hazard out in the hall.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.873
If there's a fire,
they're who you want here.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.042
How are you feeling?

37:57.108 --> 38:00.712
A little foggy,
uh, but just mostly tired.

38:00.846 --> 38:03.849
That's understandable.
You've been through quite a bit.

38:03.915 --> 38:06.685
Doc, I can't feel my legs.

38:06.752 --> 38:08.687
That's entirely normal.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.522
But the feeling will come back.

38:10.589 --> 38:13.759
In a few days, we'll start
talking about physical therapy.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.961
Okay, but that's it, right?
Mend-mend a couple bones?

38:16.061 --> 38:17.929
-She's good, that's it?
-Yes.

38:18.063 --> 38:20.065
They both seem to be
in perfect health.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.401
You said, "they"?

38:22.534 --> 38:23.635
I did.

38:23.735 --> 38:28.374
Mrs. Ryder, you're pregnant.

38:33.745 --> 38:36.081
Can I-- can I kiss my wife?

38:36.147 --> 38:39.150
She's your wife.
-Yes, she is. Yes, she is.

38:43.288 --> 38:44.556
I love you, girl.

38:44.623 --> 38:47.092
-I love you.
-I love you, Judd.

38:49.461 --> 38:50.729
...pray for us sinners now

38:50.796 --> 38:52.931
and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.767
Hey, y'all.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.268
Hey.
Hey.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.604
How's my favorite
little girl doing?

38:58.737 --> 39:00.271
She's doing good, Daddy.

39:00.406 --> 39:01.607
She's doing real good.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.609
Then how come you're crying?

39:09.347 --> 39:10.482
Oh, hell, son.

39:10.616 --> 39:12.250
'Cause he gonna be
a granddaddy.

39:12.317 --> 39:15.253
-What?

39:16.354 --> 39:18.790
Well, happy birthday.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.526
Congratulations. Come on, 126.

39:20.626 --> 39:22.327
Bring it in here.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.667
Howdy.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.436
You're here to see
the Vegas, I take it?

39:30.502 --> 39:33.138
-Y-- How did you know that?
-She just had twins.

39:33.271 --> 39:34.940
Oh, the-- Yes.

39:35.006 --> 39:37.142
Well, they're not quite ready
for visitors,

39:37.208 --> 39:38.610
but you can take a seat.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.947
Thank you.

39:56.828 --> 39:59.465
Twins.

39:59.531 --> 40:02.033
-Something, huh?
Mm-hmm.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.369
That's a couple of somethings.

40:11.510 --> 40:13.712
How you been, Grace?

40:15.581 --> 40:17.182
I've been good.

40:18.717 --> 40:20.351
How you been?

40:20.486 --> 40:22.020
Good. Getting by.

40:22.153 --> 40:23.722
Tommy, uh, Tommy said
you'd didn't end up

40:23.855 --> 40:24.890
going to Georgetown.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.759
I told you that myself, Judd.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.361
I guess you meant it, too.

40:30.496 --> 40:32.163
Yeah. Guess I did.

40:36.334 --> 40:37.903
How'd your daddy take it?

40:38.036 --> 40:41.372
My daddy's not
the boss of me, Judd.

40:41.507 --> 40:43.041
Right.

40:51.617 --> 40:53.885
You got a tattoo.

40:55.721 --> 40:58.890
Uh, I did. "Psalm 31."

40:58.957 --> 41:00.759
So that, uh...

41:02.360 --> 41:05.030
...so I can remember
what really matters.

41:05.096 --> 41:07.899
"Let me never be ashamed.

41:07.966 --> 41:11.202
Deliver me
in thy righteousness."

41:11.269 --> 41:12.738
That's the one.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.239
Hmm.

41:18.409 --> 41:21.880
I can't say that I don't
feel ashamed, though.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.217
Ashamed of what, Judd?

41:26.284 --> 41:28.153
I lied to you.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.421
I looked you in your eye,

41:30.556 --> 41:32.290
I lied to your face.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.926
Yeah, you did.

41:35.661 --> 41:37.929
I wish I hadn't.

41:45.070 --> 41:48.607
Oh, Tommy said, uh,
you got a new job?

41:48.674 --> 41:51.242
Yeah, I did. I'm, um...

41:51.309 --> 41:54.245
I'm training
to be a 911 dispatcher.

41:55.113 --> 41:57.182
Well, I think that's wonderful.

41:57.282 --> 41:58.684
Thank you.

41:58.784 --> 42:00.451
You're welcome.

42:07.859 --> 42:11.129
Are you seeing anyone?

42:12.698 --> 42:15.166
Uh...

42:16.868 --> 42:19.805
Yeah, I got myself
a fella, Judd.

42:23.474 --> 42:24.610
That's good.

42:24.676 --> 42:26.544
Mm-hmm.

42:26.645 --> 42:28.647
That's a lucky man.

42:28.714 --> 42:30.816
Yeah, he is.

42:33.518 --> 42:35.887
He's too dumb
to know it, though.

42:36.722 --> 42:38.023
Or stubborn.

42:38.156 --> 42:39.725
I'm not sure which.

42:39.825 --> 42:43.895
All I know is that he hasn't
picked up a phone in six months.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.169
Hey, you two.

42:51.236 --> 42:52.671
-Oh, boy...
Hey.

42:54.472 --> 42:56.507
Oh...

42:56.574 --> 42:58.509
Mm.

42:58.576 --> 43:01.179
How would you two like to come
back and meet your goddaughters?

43:01.246 --> 43:03.414
You said <i>our</i> goddaughters?

43:03.514 --> 43:05.583
So these people are using
the birth of their babies

43:05.684 --> 43:07.085
to play matchmaker.

43:07.185 --> 43:08.486
These people are very,
very sneaky.

43:08.553 --> 43:09.888
I should've warned you
about that.

43:10.021 --> 43:11.556
Diabolical.
