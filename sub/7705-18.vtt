WEBVTT

00:02.069 --> 00:05.537
Just try it again.
This time I'll get it.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.573
Okay, tell me
what I'm thinking.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.608
Okay.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.411
You're thinking of..

00:12.413 --> 00:14.380
...Florence Henderson.

00:14.382 --> 00:17.316
I was thinking of a fork.

00:17.318 --> 00:20.386
But wasn't her
maiden name Florence Fork?

00:22.490 --> 00:26.325
Close enough, alright,
think of something else.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.327
Okay.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.363
You're thinking of..

00:32.133 --> 00:35.034
...the 1927 Yankees.

00:35.036 --> 00:37.403
I was still thinking of a fork.

00:37.405 --> 00:40.339
But didn't one of their
pitchers throw a fork ball?

00:40.341 --> 00:43.609
- I don't know.
- Well trust me, he did.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.379
Hi, guys.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.114
Hello.

00:49.116 --> 00:52.151
Oh, we're okay.
Don't get up.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.552
I wasn't going to.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.654
Guess what?
ALF can read our minds.

00:55.656 --> 00:58.424
He's not reading
mine at the moment.

00:58.426 --> 01:02.428
Yes, I am.
I'm just ignoring it.

01:02.430 --> 01:05.431
He's teaching me
metal telepathy.

01:05.433 --> 01:08.300
I think you mean
<i> mental</i> telepathy.

01:08.302 --> 01:09.601
Maybe it is metal.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.671
All he keeps
thinking about is forks.

01:14.375 --> 01:17.176
"How to develop
your psychic awareness

01:17.178 --> 01:18.410
in one afternoon."

01:18.412 --> 01:20.345
- We sent away for it.
- Yeah.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.848
It came with a pair
of these X-ray glasses.

01:22.850 --> 01:26.652
You wasted good money
on a mind-reading kit?

01:26.654 --> 01:30.689
We'll make it all back
with our stock market picks.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.459
ALF, you come from an
advanced civilization.

01:33.461 --> 01:36.228
How can you be so gullible?

01:36.230 --> 01:38.831
You're right. I'm ashamed.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.535
Nice underwear, Kate.

01:46.674 --> 01:49.675
[theme music]

02:00.221 --> 02:03.388
[no audio]

02:16.237 --> 02:19.404
[music continues]

02:49.270 --> 02:51.837
[instrumental music]

02:53.340 --> 02:56.408
Oh, good. Everyone's here.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.676
Where's Kate?

02:57.678 --> 02:59.545
I-in the shower.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.746
Thanks.

03:02.449 --> 03:04.316
He wouldn't.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.817
He might.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.886
[Kate screaming]

03:07.888 --> 03:09.388
He did.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.794
Found her.

03:15.796 --> 03:19.298
ALF, you don't walk into
other people's showers.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.432
I didn't walk in.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.768
I just pulled
the curtain open.

03:22.770 --> 03:27.539
I<i> insist</i> that you respect
my wife's privacy.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.975
I didn't know
she was gonna be naked.

03:31.278 --> 03:33.478
Don't you ever do that again.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.515
Alright, alright.
We're movin' on.

03:36.517 --> 03:39.384
I need to have
a family meeting here.

03:41.589 --> 03:44.389
- ALF!
- They'll call back.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.327
You do that again,
you're a seat cover.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.929
- Do what again?
- You know what!

03:50.931 --> 03:54.433
ALF, that was very rude
hanging up the phone like that.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.402
You're right. I'm sorry.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.737
You look a little
different today.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.473
- Oh, I know--
- You used to have a mustache?

04:01.475 --> 04:03.875
No, I got my braces off.

04:03.877 --> 04:07.746
Yeah, but didn't you
used to have a mustache, too?

04:07.748 --> 04:11.016
ALF, what do you have
to say that's so important?

04:11.018 --> 04:14.019
Today is March the first.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.821
You'd better not be finished.

04:15.823 --> 04:20.626
I wasn't.
Tomorrow is the second.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.728
- I'm calling Mindy back.
- Wait! Wait! Wait!

04:22.730 --> 04:24.696
Come here. Come back here.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.799
Every 75 years on March 2nd

04:27.801 --> 04:31.603
I go through
a complex physiological

04:31.605 --> 04:35.007
and psychological
transformation.

04:35.009 --> 04:36.775
What?

04:36.777 --> 04:38.443
I go goofy.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.514
All Melmacians go through it.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.583
From sunrise to sunset

04:44.585 --> 04:47.653
my personality
will change dramatically.

04:47.655 --> 04:50.656
Ah, how dramatic is this change?

04:50.658 --> 04:53.325
One never knows till it happens.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.494
But expect the unexpected

04:55.496 --> 04:57.929
wildly erratic behavior

04:57.931 --> 04:59.698
personality shifts.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.700
The main thing
is that I'll do anything

05:01.702 --> 05:05.837
to get out of that cage
and get my hands on a cat.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.539
Any questions?

05:07.541 --> 05:10.542
- I have one.
- You, in the tie.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.943
What cage?

05:11.945 --> 05:14.546
Oh, the cage you're
going to build for me.

05:14.548 --> 05:17.582
The one with
the reinforced sides.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.485
Let me get this straight.

05:20.487 --> 05:23.588
You're gonna act strange
and you're gonna eat cats.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.324
So what's the change?

05:25.326 --> 05:27.326
It's a matter of degree.

05:27.328 --> 05:30.495
Imagine ALF to the tenth power.

05:31.065 --> 05:33.398
It boggles the mind.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.568
[instrumental music]

05:42.609 --> 05:43.875
Excuse me, Willie.

05:43.877 --> 05:47.112
N-not now, ALF,
I'm trying to finish this cage.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.914
Will you talk to me later?

05:48.916 --> 05:51.783
When would be good
to tell you it's all wrong?

05:52.786 --> 05:54.553
And what's wrong with it?

05:54.555 --> 05:58.357
Well, for one thing,
it's too small.

05:58.359 --> 06:02.928
I'm gonna need much more room
for writhing and thrashing.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.464
Well, ALF,
you didn't say anything

06:05.466 --> 06:08.433
about writhing and thrashing.

06:08.435 --> 06:10.736
I thought it was a given.

06:10.738 --> 06:13.739
Look, I found this
photo album in my spaceship.

06:13.741 --> 06:18.043
I think there's a picture in
here of the last cage we built.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.845
Yeah, here it is.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.647
Well, that doesn't look
anything like what I built.

06:22.649 --> 06:25.150
That's all iron and steel.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.919
Yeah. And the inside is padded.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.591
Well, I haven't got time now

06:32.593 --> 06:34.626
to rebuild this whole cage.

06:34.628 --> 06:37.596
Oh, look,
that's my cousin Kendall.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.498
- Step-cousin actually.
- It-it..

06:39.500 --> 06:41.166
That's him with his first car.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.468
- ALF..
- Well, look here.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.170
Here's my god-son Jed.

06:45.172 --> 06:49.875
That must've been taken
at his 100th birthday party.

06:49.877 --> 06:53.612
- That's me on the pony.
- Oh.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.147
Say, you photograph very well.

06:55.149 --> 06:58.016
- You know, I never thought so.
- Look, ALF, what..

06:58.018 --> 07:01.153
What if I just try to
reinforce what I've got here?

07:01.155 --> 07:02.187
Good idea.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.889
¶ She hates California ¶

07:03.891 --> 07:05.690
¶ It's cold and it's damp.. ¶¶

07:05.692 --> 07:08.860
Mr. Ochmonek!
H-he's on his way over.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.962
Come on, ALF,
get in here! Hide, quick!

07:10.964 --> 07:14.966
But I like Sinatra.
Especially the early years.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.569
- Move it!
- It's dark in there.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.971
- Go!
- Oh.

07:19.973 --> 07:23.675
¶ That's why
the lady is a tramp ¶

07:23.677 --> 07:26.945
¶ Yeah yeah yeah ¶

07:26.947 --> 07:29.080
¶ That's why the lady.. ¶

07:29.082 --> 07:31.650
¶ That's why the lady ¶
¶ That's why the lady ¶

07:31.652 --> 07:35.987
¶ That's why
the lady is a tramp ¶¶

07:36.623 --> 07:38.223
Ah, Trevor.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.724
So you dig
the Chairman too, huh?

07:39.726 --> 07:43.061
The Chairman?
Oh, yes, of the board. Yes, yes.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.997
I-I'm quite fond of his work,
especially the early years.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.900
Tell me about it.
What, are you shipping a monkey?

07:48.902 --> 07:51.670
Oh, uh, no, no, no,
No monkey. No, no.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.872
I'm just building
a little storage shed.

07:53.874 --> 07:56.675
Because I, uh,
I need a little storage.

07:56.677 --> 08:01.246
Yeah, I've been trying to get
Raquel to build one for months.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.848
Oh, ho. Hey, hey.

08:02.850 --> 08:05.584
Hey, Trevor,
can I ask you a little favor?

08:05.586 --> 08:06.852
- Sure, neighbor.
- Uh, well..

08:06.854 --> 08:08.720
You know, Kate and I
are having our house sprayed

08:08.722 --> 08:10.922
for, uh, uh..

08:14.995 --> 08:16.161
...silverfish.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.697
I just wondered
if it would be alright

08:18.699 --> 08:21.633
if, uh, you guys could
watch our cat?

08:21.635 --> 08:23.835
Oh, well,
Raquel's allergic to cats.

08:23.837 --> 08:27.606
Her feet swell up,
all the Pitzer sisters have it.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.708
Oh, well, gee, then never mind.

08:29.710 --> 08:30.942
You know what?

08:30.944 --> 08:32.577
He could stay
with me in the bedroom.

08:32.579 --> 08:33.812
Raquel could sleep on the couch.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.747
Oh, I couldn't
ask her to do that.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.250
I could. Don't worry about it.

08:38.252 --> 08:40.619
You know, Raquel and I were
just saying the other day

08:40.621 --> 08:42.921
we never see
you and, uh, Mrs. T anymore.

08:42.923 --> 08:45.891
Well, Kate and I have been
up to our necks with ALF..

08:45.893 --> 08:48.627
...falfa! Alfalfa!

08:48.629 --> 08:50.795
Alfalfa?

08:50.797 --> 08:53.031
Yeah, Kate planted all this..

08:54.001 --> 08:55.901
...alfalfa.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.636
That's why we got
all those new tools

08:57.638 --> 08:59.938
we gotta put in
our new toolshed!

09:01.608 --> 09:04.175
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised

09:04.177 --> 09:06.711
if it was the alfalfa..

09:08.181 --> 09:11.716
...th-that caused
the silverfish!

09:12.619 --> 09:13.919
Excuse me.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.890
[instrumental music]

09:22.896 --> 09:24.829
- Is everything in there?
- Yes.

09:24.831 --> 09:27.332
Uh, pillow, owl costume

09:27.334 --> 09:29.801
and hash brown potatoes.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.837
You didn't drain
the grease, did you?

09:32.839 --> 09:35.907
Oh, and your Danish postcards
are in there, too.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.876
Danish postcards?

09:38.812 --> 09:40.779
They're pictures of Danishes!

09:42.683 --> 09:44.950
Well, I guess it's that time.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.352
- Well, good luck, ALF.
- Thanks, Brian.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.721
Now remember,
Willie, you are not

09:49.723 --> 09:51.957
I repeat,
not to let me out of here

09:51.959 --> 09:54.259
under any circumstances.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.628
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.929
Good.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.970
Good. Now let me out.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.339
I have to use
the little alien's room.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.040
Oh, sure.

10:09.042 --> 10:12.110
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

10:12.112 --> 10:14.713
Didn't I say not
to open this door

10:14.715 --> 10:16.815
under any circumstances?

10:16.817 --> 10:18.817
Well, I thought, uh..

10:18.819 --> 10:20.785
I thought you
really had to go.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.254
You have a lunatic
on your hands here.

10:23.256 --> 10:27.726
You've got to be prepared for
all kinds of diabolical tricks.

10:27.728 --> 10:30.061
(Willie)
Okay, okay.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.398
(ALF)
You know, maybe I should go

10:33.400 --> 10:35.634
just to be on the safe side.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.002
Forget it.

10:37.004 --> 10:39.904
(ALF)
Good. You're
finally catching on.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.307
Now, now let me out.
I have to go.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.276
[laughs]
Oh, no. No.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.412
[howling]

10:48.749 --> 10:50.015
Maybe he's in pain.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.650
That's just another
one of his tricks.

10:51.652 --> 10:55.387
(ALF)
Help! Help! Fire!
Somebody let me out.

10:55.389 --> 10:56.921
He's lying.

10:56.923 --> 11:00.158
Ooh! Oh, there's
a big rat in here.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.960
Badly.

11:01.962 --> 11:05.130
[imitating Lynn]
Mom, dad, get me out of here.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.899
Lynnie, that sounded
just like you.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.135
Wow, he's really good.

11:10.137 --> 11:13.905
Excuse me, but this
is really weird. I can't watch.

11:13.907 --> 11:17.142
[imitating Brian]
Wait for me, wait for me!

11:17.144 --> 11:18.810
Did I say that?

11:18.812 --> 11:20.045
Brian, you better go
to your room, too.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.413
This could get out of hand.

11:21.415 --> 11:22.781
[imitating Willie]
This could get out of hand.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.182
This could get out of hand.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.919
He's good.
He's very very good. Mmm.

11:27.921 --> 11:30.822
He's almost
as good as Rich Little.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.357
[imitating Kate]
Can Rich Little do this?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.693
Can Rich Little do this?

11:34.695 --> 11:35.860
Stop!

11:35.862 --> 11:38.396
[imitating Kate]
Stop, stop.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.700
It's gonna be a long night.

11:41.702 --> 11:44.869
[instrumental music]

11:45.839 --> 11:47.739
(ALF)
Yo, B.. Brian.

11:47.741 --> 11:48.907
Where are you going?

11:48.909 --> 11:50.341
To get some milk.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.478
Oh, yeah, that would
sure hit the spot.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.846
Hey, come here.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.015
I'm not supposed
to talk to you.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.150
Not talk to your old buddy?

11:59.152 --> 12:00.919
You don't have to be afraid.

12:00.921 --> 12:04.289
It's over.
I'm back to my old self.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.790
Come on, let me out.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.492
You said not until sunrise.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.327
(ALF)
'Brian, it's me.'

12:09.329 --> 12:10.962
The old ALFer.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.364
The guy that taught
you how to read minds.

12:13.366 --> 12:16.367
In fact, I know
what you're thinking right now.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.103
What?

12:18.104 --> 12:19.838
That you want
to let your old pal

12:19.840 --> 12:21.806
out of this cage, right?

12:21.808 --> 12:24.309
No. I was thinking of a fork.

12:25.512 --> 12:26.978
[ALF imitating buzzer]

12:26.980 --> 12:29.180
- What's that?
- Oh, it's my alarm.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.150
It's sunrise.
You can let me out now.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.986
- But it's still dark.
- Not on Melmac.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.388
See, that's the time we go by.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.424
So I made it. Open up.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.793
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure, I'm sure.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.461
Open up. I'm hungry.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.063
Okay.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.000
[sighs]
Thanks.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.469
Oh, hey would
you check in that cage?

12:51.471 --> 12:54.405
I left my hash brown
bucket in there.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.811
Ha! Ha!

12:59.813 --> 13:02.347
ALF, why are you
locking me in this cage?

13:02.349 --> 13:05.784
Sorry, kid.
I need a head start.

13:05.786 --> 13:08.520
Save me some hash browns!

13:08.522 --> 13:10.522
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

13:15.428 --> 13:16.494
[door shuts]

13:18.031 --> 13:19.898
[instrumental music]

13:19.900 --> 13:21.566
(Brian)
Mom! dad!

13:21.568 --> 13:24.335
Mom! Dad! Let me out!

13:26.506 --> 13:28.573
Oh, boy, he does a good Brian.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.176
You'd hardly know it was ALF.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.578
It's me, it's really me.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.180
Nice try.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.515
Honey, honey, maybe it is Brian.

13:37.517 --> 13:41.419
But that can't be.
Brian's in.. Brian's in bed.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.887
Brian!

13:42.889 --> 13:44.823
- What?
- Not you.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.858
- Brian!
- What?

13:46.860 --> 13:48.993
I'll go check his room.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.862
Honey, honey.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.197
I-it looks
just like Brian.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.599
Oh, maybe ALF can
change his shape, too.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.235
No, he can't. It's me.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.206
Alright.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.842
Alright, if you're really Brian

14:03.844 --> 14:05.310
what's your favorite food?

14:05.312 --> 14:08.146
- Spaghetti.
- Uh, that's ridiculous.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.081
No, no, no,
that is his favorite food.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.583
Well, I thought
it was Lynn who liked spaghetti.

14:11.585 --> 14:12.951
- No.
- No?

14:12.953 --> 14:15.587
- No.
- He's not back there.

14:15.589 --> 14:17.121
Say, what's your favorite food?

14:17.123 --> 14:19.891
I don't know.
White boiled potatoes.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.159
I thought you
liked spaghetti.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.327
- It's alright.
- Alright?

14:22.329 --> 14:23.862
- It's fine.
- You always--

14:23.864 --> 14:26.331
Willie.. Willie,
I-I'm going to open this cage.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.266
No. No, wait.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.501
What's your
mother's maiden name?

14:30.503 --> 14:32.804
What's a maiden name?

14:32.805 --> 14:35.106
Well, you know it's the name
she had before she was married.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.208
- Kate.
- No, her other name.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.878
- Her last name.
- Halligan.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.014
- Oh, Brian! Honey!
- Brian..

14:43.016 --> 14:46.050
- Are you alright?
- What happened to ALF?

14:46.052 --> 14:47.385
I let him go.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.621
- Oh, honey.
- I'll go check out back.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.623
Brian, why?

14:52.959 --> 14:55.126
He told me
the change was over.

14:55.128 --> 14:58.229
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh, honey, it's alright.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.932
But what were you doing up
in the middle of the night?

15:00.934 --> 15:02.400
I thought I wanted some milk.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.969
Maybe it was ALF trying
to call me in my mind.

15:04.971 --> 15:08.273
No, I-I-I don't think so, Brian.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.141
The gate to the Ochmoneks'
is wide open.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.477
Oh, no. Lucky's over there.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.413
Ah, I-I'm going next door
and see if ALF is there.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.683
You, you stay here
in case he comes back.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.084
[sighs]

15:21.154 --> 15:24.589
Oh, well, you-you'd both
better go back to bed.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.926
- I can't sleep now.
- I'm hungry.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.594
Alright, alright.
We'll, uh..

15:29.596 --> 15:32.430
We'll stay up and have a snack.
W-what would you like?

15:32.432 --> 15:34.599
- Spaghetti.
- White boiled potatoes.

15:37.203 --> 15:40.138
[knock on door]

15:41.207 --> 15:43.041
(Trevor)
'Hey, Raquel!'

15:43.043 --> 15:45.543
[snoring]

15:49.482 --> 15:51.049
Raquel!

15:51.051 --> 15:54.352
Oh.. Oh, was I snoring again?

15:54.354 --> 15:56.554
I'm comin'. I'm comin'.
keep your shorts on.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.656
Who could that be
at this time of night?

15:58.658 --> 16:01.559
It's probably the airport
asking you to keep it down.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.394
[knock on door]

16:03.396 --> 16:06.731
Alright, alright, alright.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.266
- Hey, Tanner.
- Trevor.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.201
- Hello, Willie.
- Oh, hi. Hi, Raquel.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.236
I'm sorry to bother
you this late at night

16:12.238 --> 16:14.572
but, I just came over..

16:14.574 --> 16:17.508
I-I-I was hoping
I could get Lucky.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.179
I mean, Lucky, our cat.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.281
Oh. At this time of night?

16:23.283 --> 16:25.116
Well, we were worried about him.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.485
It's his first night
away from home.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.288
Yeah. I had a feeling.
Raquel, get the cat.

16:30.290 --> 16:33.324
I can't go near that cat.
You know it makes my feet swell.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.394
Oh, yeah, then you'll
be wearing my shoes again.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.014
I'll get the cat.

16:39.015 --> 16:40.465
- I'm sorry, Raquel.
- That's alright.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.467
Willie, can
I get you something?

16:42.469 --> 16:45.570
I just bought one of those
international coffees.

16:45.572 --> 16:50.375
- No!
- Something without caffeine?

16:50.377 --> 16:52.477
No, no.

16:52.479 --> 16:53.711
No, I don't need
anything from the kitchen.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.646
I can't find the
little fella anywhere.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.281
[machine whirring]

16:57.283 --> 16:59.584
Hey, what's going
on in the kitchen?

17:03.656 --> 17:05.223
[whispers]
ALF!

17:05.225 --> 17:08.226
How long do you preheat
these for a cat?

17:08.228 --> 17:09.494
Give me that!

17:09.496 --> 17:11.662
[laughing]

17:18.738 --> 17:20.738
What's so funny?

17:20.740 --> 17:23.074
This toaster oven..

17:23.076 --> 17:26.411
Is it a toaster,
or is it an oven?

17:26.413 --> 17:29.280
Why are you holding it?

17:29.282 --> 17:32.283
Haven't you ever felt
the need to just hold something?

17:32.285 --> 17:33.684
I just found
the strangest thing.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.320
An open can of minestrone
in the kitchen.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.089
Oh, that was
probably the cat.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.158
Your cat opens tin cans?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.426
It's amazing, I know.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.594
We're trying
to get him on "Letterman."

17:43.596 --> 17:45.163
[crash]
Oh, my!

17:45.165 --> 17:46.631
That better not be my cologne.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.637
Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.839
ALF, we're going home.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.808
- I want that cat.
- No!

17:56.810 --> 17:58.576
Alright. Who needs him?

17:58.578 --> 18:01.479
There are a million cats out
there! Give me your car keys.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.648
ALF, we're gonna
go home, right now!

18:03.650 --> 18:04.715
No!

18:04.717 --> 18:07.718
[laughing hysterically]

18:07.720 --> 18:10.288
Look.. Ow! Ugh!

18:10.290 --> 18:12.857
He broke my glass eye.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.660
- I'll buy you another one.
- You got that right.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.328
[machine whirring]

18:17.330 --> 18:18.796
Raquel, that sounds
like your riding mower!

18:18.798 --> 18:20.498
[gasps]

18:20.500 --> 18:22.333
- Oh, no!
- Hey!

18:22.335 --> 18:24.635
Where you going
with my toaster oven?

18:27.173 --> 18:31.476
(man on radio)
'Unit Six treed cat
at 13-1-4-5 Julio Street.'

18:31.478 --> 18:34.212
'What? Hoolio Street?'

18:34.214 --> 18:35.780
'I hate this town.'

18:37.317 --> 18:39.183
- Where was that again?
- Uh, uh, uh..

18:39.185 --> 18:42.220
13-1-4-5 Julio Street.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.555
Oh, no.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.657
I should've
seen this coming.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.359
What?

18:48.361 --> 18:50.895
We're running out
of those little flags.

18:50.897 --> 18:53.498
(man on radio)
'Unit-9, proceed
to 105th and Decker.'

18:53.500 --> 18:56.634
'Investigate break-in
at Pete's House O Pets.'

18:56.636 --> 18:58.736
Well, here's
105th and Decker.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.838
Look, dad.
It's nowhere near Julio Street.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.773
ALF can't be doing
all those things.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.342
Well, you're right, of course.

19:04.344 --> 19:07.311
How far could he get
on a lawn mower?

19:07.313 --> 19:10.348
(man on radio)
'All units in the vicinity
proceed to County Zoo.'

19:10.350 --> 19:12.683
'Investigate report
of a missing tiger.'

19:13.686 --> 19:15.653
Oh, my gosh, ALF.

19:15.655 --> 19:19.423
Oh, no, even ALF
would have more sense

19:19.425 --> 19:22.760
than to kidnap a tiger.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.595
Yeah, you're right.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.731
Lynnie, let's get in the car
drive around the neighborhood

19:26.733 --> 19:28.466
one more time
and see if we can find him.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.468
But, what if he's
got the tiger?

19:30.470 --> 19:33.471
Then they won't be hard to spot.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.606
Hey, where you guys
off to at 4:00 in the mornin'?

19:35.608 --> 19:39.944
Oh, uh, just, uh, goin',
uh, out for, uh, a drive.

19:39.946 --> 19:44.415
Hey, keep an eye out
for Raquel's lawn mower, eh?

19:44.417 --> 19:47.718
Say, Trevor,
speaking of eye out

19:47.720 --> 19:50.555
uh, I'm really sorry about
what happened to your..

19:50.557 --> 19:55.226
Hey, forget about it.
I got a drawer full of them.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.928
Listen, uh..

19:56.930 --> 19:59.964
I know we don't talk much and
this may not be the right time

19:59.966 --> 20:01.566
but, uh..

20:06.406 --> 20:07.972
I'm not a happy man.

20:10.677 --> 20:13.544
(woman on TV)
'One, two, three,
burn that tummy.'

20:13.546 --> 20:15.980
'You can't hit the beaches
if you can't see your feet.'

20:15.982 --> 20:17.448
'Three..'

20:21.421 --> 20:23.554
- No luck?
- Nope.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.590
We did find
the lawn mower, though.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.659
Oh, good, I won't have
to buy Raquel a new one.

20:28.661 --> 20:32.363
You will if you can't get the
bonsai trees out of the blade.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.999
[sighs]
Anything on the police scanner?

20:35.001 --> 20:38.336
Just a couple
of domestic spats.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.871
One of them was
at the Ochmoneks'.

20:40.873 --> 20:44.508
Brian? Honey,
you have a headache?

20:44.510 --> 20:47.245
No, I'm thinking of a fork.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.914
I'm trying to get ALF back.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.749
Metal telepathy.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.385
I'm the one who
let him get away.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.687
I've got to make him come back.

20:56.689 --> 20:59.390
Honey, he'll come
back when he can.

20:59.392 --> 21:00.891
- If he can.
- Lynn.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.760
Well, by now,
his 12 hours are up.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.429
I'm sure he's come out of it and
he might not know where he is.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.331
Dad, something terrible
could have happened.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.599
Alright, let's just try

21:08.601 --> 21:10.768
to think positively
about this, okay?

21:10.770 --> 21:14.505
I-I'm sure
that he'll be home soon.

21:14.507 --> 21:17.375
Hey, and he-he never misses
"Captain Kangaroo".

21:17.377 --> 21:18.709
[thud]

21:21.614 --> 21:24.382
(Lynn)
'ALF! Oh.'

21:24.384 --> 21:26.350
Excuse me, but..

21:26.352 --> 21:28.886
...do you good people
have a fork?

21:28.888 --> 21:30.921
The mind reading worked!

21:30.923 --> 21:33.024
- Oh.
- Oh, ALF.

21:33.026 --> 21:35.526
ALF, a-a-are you alright?

21:35.528 --> 21:37.295
Yeah, yeah, fine.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.597
- Why do you ask?
- Well, we were so worried.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.799
- Where were you?
- Out.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.869
Well, do you think this
thing has run its course now?

21:44.871 --> 21:49.740
To quote Yogi Berra,
"It ain't over till it's over."

21:49.742 --> 21:51.942
There's still one more stage.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.844
Well, what stage is that?

21:53.846 --> 21:55.379
Quoting people.

21:55.381 --> 22:00.685
And as Mercutio said
"All's well that ends well."

22:00.687 --> 22:03.754
No, no, no, Mercutio said

22:03.756 --> 22:05.923
"It is not so deep as a well

22:05.925 --> 22:07.625
but it is enough,
it will serve."

22:07.627 --> 22:08.959
- Oh, right.
- Mm-hm.

22:08.961 --> 22:12.630
But, "To err is human,
to forgive, divine."

22:12.632 --> 22:14.699
Plutarch, I believe.

22:14.701 --> 22:17.735
Well, at least you've recovered.

22:17.737 --> 22:20.538
- Sort of.
- Yeah.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.840
Or as Marcel Proust said

22:22.842 --> 22:24.742
"We are healed of suffering

22:24.744 --> 22:29.046
only by experiencing
it to the full."

22:29.048 --> 22:31.716
Or was that Marcel Marceau?

22:31.718 --> 22:34.118
No, that couldn't be right.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.554
Marcel Marceau said..

22:38.591 --> 22:41.659
[instrumental music]

22:43.963 --> 22:46.697
Or in the words of Dustan

22:46.699 --> 22:51.869
"It ill-becomes us to jest
at a fallen potentate.

22:51.871 --> 22:55.806
And still less
before he has fallen."

22:55.808 --> 22:58.743
Say, how much longer
are you gonna do this?

22:58.745 --> 23:02.046
Well, if I may quote Porky Pig

23:02.048 --> 23:06.117
[imitating Porky Pig]
"Th-th-that's all, folks!"

23:06.119 --> 23:08.018
And speaking of Porky..

23:08.020 --> 23:09.954
[sniffing]

23:09.956 --> 23:11.522
Do I smell bacon?

23:11.524 --> 23:13.891
- No.
- Well, I'd like to.

23:13.893 --> 23:18.028
I thought you spent
the whole night eating..

23:18.030 --> 23:20.498
Eating cats.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.099
I don't think I did.

23:22.101 --> 23:25.503
At least, I don't feel bloated.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.938
But now that you mention cats

23:27.940 --> 23:31.509
I do remember storing
something in the garage.

23:31.511 --> 23:35.079
The garage?
You, this way.

23:39.419 --> 23:42.953
Well, if you've stolen any cats
they're going back immediately.

23:42.955 --> 23:45.756
- You understand?
- No problem.

23:50.897 --> 23:53.831
I-I-I'll take him back
right after breakfast.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.769
[instrumental music]

24:03.943 --> 24:06.977
[theme music]

24:31.504 --> 24:33.838
[ALF laughing]
