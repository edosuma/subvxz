00:05.320 --> 00:07.799
It's probably good nothing happened
between us.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.079
Yoohoo, I can't tell you where you
can or can't be, can I?

00:11.080 --> 00:12.239
No, you can't.

00:12.240 --> 00:15.559
If she wants to stay and chat
with inbreds and lesbos...

00:15.560 --> 00:17.119
Hang on a fucking minute!

00:17.120 --> 00:19.799
Fuck off back to Valhalla, weirdo...
Pussy.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.999
You're full of shit, Rich, you're
just scared!

00:23.000 --> 00:25.639
Man the fuck up!

00:25.640 --> 00:27.919
F- R-E-A-K, now what does that spell?

00:27.920 --> 00:29.519
Let me see... Oh, yeah, you!

00:29.520 --> 00:33.519
Now get the fuck out of my party.

It Must Be True Love

02:40.080 --> 02:42.999
Whoa! All right!

02:43.000 --> 02:45.879
Yeah! Oh, no, we're gonna get fast!

02:45.880 --> 02:47.999
Five, six, seven, eight!

02:48.000 --> 02:49.559
Whoo! Let's take it up a notch.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.319
Whoo! Whoo!

02:53.320 --> 02:56.279
All right! All right, here we go!

03:30.880 --> 03:34.279
Good morning, everyone.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.639
Right, let's dive straight in.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.079
With just two days to go
until our charity fashion show,

03:39.080 --> 03:42.279
Gracie is finally ready
to reveal her designs,

03:42.280 --> 03:45.519
and we're all very excited to hear
Professor Blood's verdict.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.279
Thank you, everyone.

03:47.280 --> 03:51.279
I have received confirmation that
our governors will be attending,

03:51.720 --> 03:54.879
so it is now of the
utmost importance

03:54.880 --> 03:58.879
that this show demonstrates the
creative and physical ability

04:00.640 --> 04:01.679
of the college.

04:01.680 --> 04:04.039
Over to you, Grace.

04:04.040 --> 04:07.119
Um... slight hiccup.

04:07.120 --> 04:11.119
Gracie? Where are the outfits?

04:14.480 --> 04:18.478
Ah!

04:21.320 --> 04:24.359
- Sorry about the lateness.
- Franky?

04:24.360 --> 04:28.359
Er... this is a committee-only
meeting.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.839
Actually, Mins,
Franky's been a life-saver.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.519
I couldn't have made them without her,
and she'll be great with the music.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.839
She should totally join us.

04:36.840 --> 04:40.359
Oh! I didn't realise
that you were still friends. Great.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.639
Brilliant. Excellent.

04:42.640 --> 04:45.799
- Really?
- Totally. Thanks a million, Franky.

04:45.800 --> 04:49.119
Er... why don't you girls show us
the fruits of your labours?

04:49.120 --> 04:53.119
As we're raising money for the
blind, our theme is tactile textures.

04:53.880 --> 04:57.519
So, we've used classic suit
and dress patterns

04:57.520 --> 05:00.719
with loads of different fabrics
that are cool to touch,

05:00.720 --> 05:04.719
like silk, faux fur and velvet.

05:07.720 --> 05:10.239
I knew this was gonna happen.

05:10.240 --> 05:14.239
Gracie, those... are not what we
discussed.

05:14.400 --> 05:18.399
I... I fear she's having some kind
of... personal crisis.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.359
Oh, come on! >

05:20.360 --> 05:23.359
I understand we all need
a platform to express ourselves

05:23.360 --> 05:26.319
but this show is not about you,
Grace.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.759
It's about raising money. Mm.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.999
I just dread to think
what the governors would say

05:32.000 --> 05:34.599
seeing these avant-garde designs.

05:34.600 --> 05:38.559
They're so... weird.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.399
Take it from me, sir...

05:41.400 --> 05:43.679
I know what I'm talking about.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.999
I see what you mean.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.599
I propose a drastic rethink.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.799
A new theme, new outfits.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.519
New models. Nick and I should
be the triumphant finale.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.319
I've got it.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.759
White tie and tiara.

05:58.760 --> 06:02.559
If it's good enough for Elton, it's
good enough for Roundview. Agreed?

06:02.560 --> 06:06.199
Mini, you have two days to save the
show.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.879
I won't let you down, sir.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.279
Right.

06:10.280 --> 06:13.079
Moving forward. Grace?

06:13.080 --> 06:15.319
You're fired. Liv?

06:15.320 --> 06:17.559
Let's get some models.

06:17.560 --> 06:21.279
OK, it was a bit harsh, but she's
developing a serious attitude problem.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.679
Mini! Can you just hold up
for one fucking second?

06:24.680 --> 06:27.599
Firstly, remove your hand from my
arm.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.959
Secondly, could you please refrain
from swearing at me?

06:30.960 --> 06:34.959
Yeah, sorry. It's just you've been
really rude to me and it's not fair.

06:36.600 --> 06:40.159
Can you just stop being bitches
so we can all be friends, OK?

06:40.160 --> 06:44.159
I can't believe
you just called us bitches.

06:44.360 --> 06:48.359
Bitches? See, I told you, Liv.
Major attitude problem.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.319
- That was just uncalled for.
- No, it wasn't.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.039
You're meant to be my best friends

06:53.040 --> 06:57.039
and you just told everyone
I'm having a breakdown, and I'm not!

06:59.440 --> 07:03.439
You only have yourself to blame.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.639
Toodles!

07:06.640 --> 07:09.319
Fine! Fuck off!

07:09.320 --> 07:11.279
You fucking fuck-heads!

07:12.440 --> 07:14.559
Truffle shuffle! Truffle shuffle!

07:14.560 --> 07:16.839
Truffle shuffle!

07:18.360 --> 07:19.239
All right, sexy?

07:19.240 --> 07:21.079
Listen, I need you for a few minutes.

07:21.080 --> 07:25.079
Oi, Mini, when Nick stops satisfying
you, my cock is all yours, yeah?

07:25.320 --> 07:27.479
I don't fuck losers.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.079
- Nicely played, babes.
- Boys, say bye-bye to your captain.

07:33.080 --> 07:36.279
- I want to be alone with my man.
- Mm.

07:36.280 --> 07:40.279
Outside. Five mins.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.639
You can go first.
I'll save the big news till after.

07:51.640 --> 07:55.519
OK, how would you like to be
the best boyfriend in the world

07:55.520 --> 07:57.839
and help me out
at the charity fashion show?

07:57.840 --> 08:01.719
I need two gorgeous models to walk
with me and Liv down the runway.

08:01.720 --> 08:05.719
No can do. Training comes first.

08:10.160 --> 08:13.199
Do you not want to know
what my surprise is?

08:13.200 --> 08:17.199
My dad's away until Saturday. We
finally have the house to ourselves.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.279
Fashion show comes first.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.559
That's just another excuse.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.959
I've waited weeks for this.

08:24.960 --> 08:28.959
You said you wanted to,
next time I had a free gaff.

08:29.840 --> 08:33.839
I do the fashion show,
you stay over tonight.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.198
You're the ultimate boyfriend.

08:38.200 --> 08:42.159
- Oh, bring a friend too.
- Get in.

08:42.159 --> 08:46.159
But I might not be in the mood
tonight. I've just been really stressed.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.199
Stressed you won't live up to your
rep?

08:49.200 --> 08:50.959
What rep? I'm not a slag!

08:50.960 --> 08:54.959
Well, from the stories you tell,
you're no virgin.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.959
Are you?

08:58.960 --> 09:02.279
I'm just not sure
you'll be able to handle me.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.279
Babe, you don't want to know
what I've handled.

09:04.280 --> 09:07.839
I really don't.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.759
My exes are nothing compared to you.

09:11.760 --> 09:15.759
And I promise tonight will be
special.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.599
Of course. It will be amazing.

09:20.600 --> 09:24.599
Perfect.

09:31.680 --> 09:34.999
Fuck.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.199
You're walking down a catwalk!

09:41.200 --> 09:44.119
You're not walking the plank here,
OK?

09:44.120 --> 09:47.079
The catwalk is not a playground.
Sashay in.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.599
Liv, come over here. Stop the music.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.159
I said sprinkle down the runway.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.919
I'll teach you how to sprinkle.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.919
BOTH LAUGH

09:59.920 --> 10:01.959
Who the fuck is that weirdo?

10:01.960 --> 10:04.759
Um... he's your partner for the
finale.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.439
Well, the... the bit before the
finale.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.479
Nick and I are closing the show.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.919
Obviously.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.919
Hey, sexual.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.079
When's your friend going to show us

10:20.080 --> 10:22.199
what he's got in store for Olivia?

10:22.200 --> 10:23.439
Music!

10:23.440 --> 10:26.439
Come on, Rider.

10:26.440 --> 10:28.119
Nice moves.

10:28.120 --> 10:32.119
Ow!

10:36.640 --> 10:36.959
Ah!

10:36.960 --> 10:40.959
Ah! Liv, take it seriously.
It's not Strictly.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.199
Can't wait for tonight, babes.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.719
Come round about eight.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.879
I'll get some food in. For breakfast.

10:52.880 --> 10:56.639
Mm. And I got some supplies.

10:56.640 --> 10:59.639
Oh, no. Ultra nightmare.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.879
I totally forgot. I promised Liv I'd
hang out with her tonight.

11:02.880 --> 11:06.879
I'm so sorry. Don't be stroppy,
babe. I'd rather be with you.

11:07.240 --> 11:11.239
But Liv is just all depressed
by her lack of love life.

11:11.280 --> 11:15.279
Right, OK.
Let's all go out together, then.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.639
I'll bring Rider. Bit of matchmaking.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.319
You're so sweet. I love you.

11:21.320 --> 11:24.799
Mm, yeah, me too.

11:24.800 --> 11:28.799
Would You
Have Me Born With Wooden Eyes?

12:00.480 --> 12:02.319
Is that you, baby?

13:18.000 --> 13:21.919
Oh. Gorgeous girlie.

13:21.920 --> 13:24.479
It's like looking in a mirror.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.359
You wish.

13:26.360 --> 13:30.359
Over here, missus.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.679
Didn't keep you up last night,
did I?

13:32.680 --> 13:36.679
Thatguy turned out to be a right
goer. Couldn't get enough of it.

13:36.720 --> 13:39.359
When will I get to meet
this prince of yours?

13:39.360 --> 13:40.959
That's enough.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.839
It's much better.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.759
What a stunner you are.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.599
Off you go and have fun.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.359
I always do with Nick.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.639
We're in love.

13:51.640 --> 13:55.559
Well, you hold onto him, angel.
You don't want to end up like me.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.399
Remember, men only want one thing,

13:58.400 --> 14:02.399
and once they've got it,
they disappear into thin air.

14:05.080 --> 14:09.079
Do your pelvic floor exercises!
That's the way to a man's heart.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.719
Oh, no.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.119
Nick.

14:22.120 --> 14:26.119
You're gonna have to help me.

14:26.600 --> 14:30.399
All right. It's all about focus,
babes. Pick your spot

14:30.400 --> 14:33.439
and visualise yourself
putting that ball right there.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.199
No, no. No, no, no. Come back.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.319
You're shit.

14:37.320 --> 14:39.119
Nick's are the only balls I play
with.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.359
Nick's are the only balls
I play with. Lucky boy.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.439
At least you're good at
something.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.199
This one for the match, Nick, yeah?
Mm.

14:44.200 --> 14:48.199
For you it's over, big man.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.919
Close your legs. You're drooling.

14:50.920 --> 14:54.919
That is gross.

14:55.320 --> 14:58.319
Whoo! We whipped your arses.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.839
Three games in a row, baby.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.119
Whatever. Mins, let's head back to
mine.

15:02.120 --> 15:06.119
Er... if you're happy to give up
just like that, then that's cool.

15:06.800 --> 15:10.679
I just thought
my boyfriend was better than that.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.879
But no worries.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.839
Loser.

15:14.840 --> 15:18.839
All right, OK, one more game
and then we head back to the crib.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.319
Swap teams, though. Shotgun, Liv.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.359
And let's spice things up a
bit.

15:24.360 --> 15:27.359
Whoever loses each point
downs an epic mouthful each.

15:27.360 --> 15:27.999
Awesome.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.559
Er... not for me and Liv.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.719
Getting wasted the night before my
fashion shoot is very clever.

15:32.720 --> 15:33.479
Oh, come on.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.199
We all need our beauty sleep.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.199
I don't. Have you seen my face?

15:37.200 --> 15:39.159
You dickhead.

15:39.160 --> 15:43.159
Go on, give us a swig.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.319
Go on. Down it.

15:47.320 --> 15:50.679
Fuck it.

15:50.680 --> 15:53.239
That's my girl.

15:53.240 --> 15:57.239
Don't be boring, babes.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.199
Yeah!

17:30.920 --> 17:32.279
I'm gonna sue!

17:38.280 --> 17:40.519
You are gonna get a slap!

17:40.520 --> 17:44.519
Fuck you.

17:48.280 --> 17:52.079
Bollocks. I've lost my fucking keys.

17:52.080 --> 17:55.479
Oh, it must have fallen out in
there.

17:55.480 --> 17:59.479
There's no way he's letting us back
in.

17:59.720 --> 18:02.359
Er... looks like we're gonna have to
call it a night, then.

18:02.360 --> 18:03.759
Liv, coming?

18:03.760 --> 18:04.879
Oi.

18:04.880 --> 18:08.679
You two ain't getting away that
easily. Let's head back to mine.

18:08.680 --> 18:12.079
Mum's working a late-nighter,
won't be back for ages.

18:12.080 --> 18:16.079
Liv, just wait till you catch
a glimpse of my pad.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.359
Never have I ever had an STI.

18:36.360 --> 18:40.359
No.

18:43.360 --> 18:46.399
Right, here's one
you girls can't get out of.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.719
Liv, that bra's coming off.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.639
Never have I ever munched cock.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.799
Oh, yes. Come on, Min, you
too.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.919
An earring? That's cheating, man.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.119
Get your jugs out!

19:07.120 --> 19:08.759
Rider, take it easy.

19:08.760 --> 19:11.199
Dress off, dress off, dress off!

19:11.200 --> 19:14.119
There's only one person that gets to
check out what's under here.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.599
And it's not you.

19:15.600 --> 19:19.599
Ha! Hm.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.239
It looks like the game's over.

19:23.240 --> 19:26.239
Good. It was shit.

19:26.240 --> 19:29.039
I don't care what you've done
or never done.

19:29.040 --> 19:32.239
I sure know what you're gonna do
now. To me.

19:32.240 --> 19:35.639
You're all right.
I mean, except for your personality.

19:35.640 --> 19:38.719
Maybe you should just stop
talking

19:38.720 --> 19:41.359
Good boy.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.039
Liv!

19:49.480 --> 19:53.479
Back in a sec.

21:00.440 --> 21:04.439
Oh. Baby.

21:15.800 --> 21:19.239
You're amazing.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.799
And you're fucking hot.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.479
Is that why you're with me?

21:24.480 --> 21:26.559
It's a bonus.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.959
You're sexy. Fit as.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.959
What's wrong?

21:36.960 --> 21:40.959
Liv's panting is ruining the mood.

21:41.200 --> 21:45.199
Well, at least she's having fun.

21:46.440 --> 21:48.559
I... I can't do this.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.319
Babe, it's been way over a month.

21:52.320 --> 21:55.079
What's the big deal?
Don't you fancy me?

21:59.000 --> 22:02.919
You know I do. I love you.

22:02.920 --> 22:06.919
Show me, then.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.599
Mins?

22:24.600 --> 22:26.039
Ugh.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.199
Oh. Oh.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.879
You've got to get her out of here
before my mother comes back.

22:30.880 --> 22:34.839
She's gonna go schizo. Shit.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.679
Stop preening and get cleaning.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.159
Where's the fucking Domestos?

22:40.160 --> 22:42.559
I can't believe that twat
got more action than me.

22:42.560 --> 22:45.639
Oh, don't cry. There's always
tomorrow.

22:45.640 --> 22:49.639
I've run out of ideas
on how to get her into bed.

22:50.480 --> 22:53.359
Rewind.

22:53.360 --> 22:54.399
You two haven't...?

22:54.400 --> 22:56.879
No.

22:56.880 --> 23:00.879
It's a bit weird, Liv. She keeps on
telling me she loves me.

23:00.920 --> 23:03.439
That's just Mini.
She's full-on all the time.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.679
It's the best and worst thing about
her.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.119
Yeah, well.

23:07.120 --> 23:11.119
Let's just take her home, yeah?

23:45.280 --> 23:47.559
I've never been here
before.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.639
Don't know anything about her mum or
dad.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.359
It's just mum.

23:51.360 --> 23:55.079
Liv, I don't even know her.

23:55.080 --> 23:59.079
Yeah, she's hot and she makes me
laugh. But that's it.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.799
And now I've been dragged
into this stupid fashion show.

24:03.800 --> 24:07.799
It's a big deal. She's just
stressing out.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.199
We're gonna be laughed at.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.719
She can't dance.

24:11.720 --> 24:14.799
We'll look ridiculous.
My team's gonna be there, my coach.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.879
You're her boyfriend.

24:16.880 --> 24:20.879
And I'm her best friend.
We need to give her a bit of help.

24:24.320 --> 24:28.319
What?

24:29.120 --> 24:33.119
You've got quite a rep,
but you're actually pretty sound.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.679
Back-handed compliment.

24:35.680 --> 24:39.679
But I'll take it.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.599
I'm sleepy.

24:43.600 --> 24:47.599
Night.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.999
With You

25:50.400 --> 25:52.399
You've gained 57 grams.

25:52.400 --> 25:56.399
Wait, um...

25:59.560 --> 26:01.119
32 grams.

26:01.120 --> 26:04.599
Er... Mini. It's not on.

26:04.600 --> 26:08.199
Let me impart a phrase that I apply
to most situations in life.

26:08.200 --> 26:12.199
Good girls don't swallow.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.799
Next.

26:37.240 --> 26:38.839
Liv. Um... call me.

26:38.840 --> 26:42.839
I've got the hangover from hell
and three hours to do 101 jobs.

26:42.880 --> 26:46.279
It's Mini, obviously.

26:46.280 --> 26:48.799
Hi, gorgeous.
Just wanted to say hello.

26:48.800 --> 26:51.119
Give me a call
when you get the chance.

26:51.120 --> 26:54.839
I could do with a hand for some of
the last-minute fashion show bits.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.079
Liv, it's me again.

26:57.080 --> 27:00.799
Call me. I really need help
with the dresses, OK?

27:04.560 --> 27:08.559
A little help, please!

27:09.000 --> 27:10.599
Yeah, move.

27:10.600 --> 27:13.319
Has anyone seen Nick or Liv?

27:13.320 --> 27:17.319
And somebody steam those dresses!

27:23.800 --> 27:25.239
All right, Princess Puke?

28:00.040 --> 28:03.199
'For those of you involved
in tonight's fashion show,

28:03.200 --> 28:07.199
'you need to be at the outdoor area
for a dress rehearsal in 15.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.999
'The rest of you, look hot
and keep your heads down.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.919
'That is all. '

28:36.200 --> 28:38.239
That's my dress.

28:38.240 --> 28:40.519
Whoops.
Sorry, Mini, I'll change.

28:40.520 --> 28:41.679
Yeah, you will.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.599
I'll wear it for the rehearsal.
We're already running late.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.239
Because I've been looking for you!

28:46.240 --> 28:48.239
Liv was just helping me
with the dance.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.599
Oh, really?Yeah, really.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.359
How very thoughtful.

28:51.360 --> 28:55.359
Liv, dress off now.

28:59.960 --> 29:02.159
Your saggy tits have stretched it.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.439
Oh, don't be a dick.

29:03.440 --> 29:06.039
You told everyone
I puked on Nick last night!

29:06.040 --> 29:08.479
Me? I was the one looking after you.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.199
I bet you two had a right laugh.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.959
Mini, you haven't got
enough dresses.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.719
Mini, who's doing our hair?

29:14.720 --> 29:17.559
Mini, where are the tickets
for the after-show party?

29:19.920 --> 29:21.639
No offence,
but that looks way better on Liv.

29:21.640 --> 29:23.039
No offence, but that looks way
better on Liv. Shut the fuck up!

29:23.040 --> 29:24.999
Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up!

29:25.000 --> 29:25.839
Silence!

29:26.960 --> 29:30.959
What is this foolish nonsensery?

29:48.640 --> 29:51.479
What does that say?

29:51.480 --> 29:53.959
Roundview charity fashion show.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.839
Anything else?

29:56.840 --> 29:58.279
Five pounds.

29:58.280 --> 30:01.959
Starts at 7.30.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.399
Let me explain.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.479
The dresses don't fit the models,

30:05.480 --> 30:08.319
half of the show
is still to be choreographed,

30:08.320 --> 30:11.839
and we have less than two hours
until the designated outdoor area

30:11.840 --> 30:15.839
is filled with students
and teachers and governors.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.959
I'll... I'll sort it out. Please.

30:17.960 --> 30:21.879
No. You fainted on school property.
You're obviously not well.

30:21.880 --> 30:22.599
I'm fine.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.519
I'm saying you're unwell.

30:24.520 --> 30:26.439
So you're unwell.

30:26.440 --> 30:30.439
Go home, Mini.

30:46.640 --> 30:50.639
Looking For A Kiss

31:50.720 --> 31:52.479
Finally.

31:52.480 --> 31:56.359
Thanks for meeting me. Nick,
you and I don't need a catwalk.

31:56.360 --> 32:00.359
What have you done?

32:03.280 --> 32:05.399
What's wrong?

32:05.400 --> 32:06.839
Mini, I...

32:06.840 --> 32:08.079
Where are you going?

32:08.080 --> 32:09.919
The show starts in 15 minutes.

32:09.920 --> 32:10.719
Fuck the show.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.159
What?

32:11.160 --> 32:13.759
Let's go, just us, back to yours.

32:13.760 --> 32:16.199
I can't abandon the troops.

32:16.200 --> 32:20.199
Reward comes from dedication,
hard work, passion.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.799
You can reward me after.

32:22.800 --> 32:23.919
No, now!

32:23.920 --> 32:27.919
No. Liv needs me to close the show.

32:34.760 --> 32:36.319
Boys Boys Boys

33:03.320 --> 33:05.399
Hello, Roundview!

33:09.200 --> 33:11.919
Thank you
to the very talented Grace Violet

33:11.920 --> 33:15.479
and the wicked Franky Fitzgerald
for providing music and lighting.

33:18.520 --> 33:21.919
And I would like to thank
my best friend Mini McGuinness.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.239
Tonight was all her idea.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.879
She's always encouraging us
to do new things.

33:26.880 --> 33:30.399
Unfortunately, she is unwell
and couldn't perform.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.319
But I'm sure she would be
very pleased with the show

33:33.320 --> 33:35.319
and we really hope
that she gets better soon.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.199
and we really hope that she gets
better soon.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.959
See you at the after-show party,
thanks for coming!

34:22.000 --> 34:24.679
We're really happy you came.

34:24.679 --> 34:28.679
Mini, you're here! Have a drink.

34:30.800 --> 34:31.958
Where's Nick?

34:31.960 --> 34:33.239
What?

34:33.239 --> 34:34.159
My boyfriend. Where is he?

34:34.159 --> 34:36.079
I don't know.

34:36.080 --> 34:40.079
Stay away from us.

34:40.320 --> 34:44.319
Mini, wait up!

34:45.639 --> 34:48.719
Hi.

34:48.719 --> 34:52.599
You look nice.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.438
Should you be talking to me?

34:54.440 --> 34:57.559
Mini's not my friend any more.

34:57.560 --> 34:58.879
Are we still friends?

34:58.880 --> 35:01.679
I was hoping more than that.

35:01.680 --> 35:05.679
If that's cool with you.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.039
That's cool.

35:07.040 --> 35:11.039
Cool.

35:32.040 --> 35:35.479
Mini, what's going on with you?
You're freaking me and Nick out.

35:35.480 --> 35:39.479
I know you haven't slept together.
Don't do it. He doesn't love you.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.919
You've been bitching behind my back?
Typical of you!

35:42.920 --> 35:44.959
You've always been jealous of me.

35:44.960 --> 35:46.959
You are making
a top prat of yourself.

35:46.960 --> 35:50.479
Explain why you're calling my
boyfriend, sleeping next to him,

35:50.480 --> 35:54.039
dancing next to him on stage.
Keep your whore hands away from him!

35:54.040 --> 35:56.919
I will not let you shit
all over me. Because I know you.

35:56.920 --> 35:59.199
I know,
underneath all of that make-up,

35:59.200 --> 36:01.519
you're just a frightened
little virgin.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.879
Look! I still love you.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.919
But I am the only one. >

36:05.920 --> 36:09.359
So, grow up, OK?
Before you've got no-one. >

36:09.360 --> 36:13.359
Get it together, you stupid bitch!

36:14.560 --> 36:18.559
Fuck!

36:22.160 --> 36:24.879
I'll dump her.

36:24.880 --> 36:28.879
If you want.

36:44.240 --> 36:48.239
You got a lighter?

37:00.720 --> 37:04.719
Looks like you're having
a pretty shit time.

37:05.160 --> 37:07.599
I can't find Nick.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.959
Grace is here.

37:09.960 --> 37:13.719
I know.

37:13.720 --> 37:16.999
I'm not trying to
ruin your life, Mini.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.559
You could have fooled me.

37:21.240 --> 37:25.159
of self-absorbed,
attention-seeking cocks.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.559
Are you looking for a fight?

37:26.560 --> 37:30.399
It was hard to see why you hung out
together. But then...

37:30.400 --> 37:32.479
I got it.

37:32.480 --> 37:36.479
You look out for each other.

37:36.800 --> 37:40.799
You love each other.

37:58.920 --> 38:02.919
Come and dance.

39:00.080 --> 39:04.079
Take me to yours.

39:23.320 --> 39:27.319
Mini!

39:27.320 --> 39:29.199
This is gonna be worth the wait,
I promise.

39:29.200 --> 39:33.199
About today.

39:35.600 --> 39:38.519
- I feel like we're not clicking.
- I know.

39:38.520 --> 39:40.919
I'll... I'll try harder.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.879
Let's blank today out.

39:42.880 --> 39:46.239
It... it didn't happen.
None of it happened.

39:46.240 --> 39:50.239
Please.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.919
Do you have, um... a...

40:40.920 --> 40:43.439
Um... yeah.

40:43.440 --> 40:46.279
Sure, cool.

40:46.280 --> 40:50.279
Right.

40:59.360 --> 41:03.359
OK.

41:49.240 --> 41:52.039
Mini...

41:52.040 --> 41:56.039
.. anything you want to tell me?

42:00.080 --> 42:04.079
I love you.

42:08.520 --> 42:12.519
Anything you want to tell me?

42:14.320 --> 42:18.319
You love me too, don't you?

42:20.320 --> 42:23.079
Yeah.

42:23.080 --> 42:27.079
I love you too.

42:50.800 --> 42:54.799
It's Only Love)

44:05.080 --> 44:07.439
All right there, my lovely?

44:07.440 --> 44:11.439
You fancy a ride?

45:33.360 --> 45:37.359
Come on.

46:26.800 --> 46:29.199
Do You Love Me?)

46:36.800 --> 46:39.159
Every night you turn up
looking like a zombie, Olivia.

46:39.160 --> 46:41.719
Do not tell me
there is nothing to worry about

46:41.720 --> 46:43.839
because your aura
is telling me quite the opposite.

46:43.840 --> 46:47.599
- Ta-da! - No-one leaves
till this bag is empty.

46:47.600 --> 46:51.599
Oh. Franky's gone. What a
lightweight.

46:51.720 --> 46:53.639
- What's going on?
- Everyone's having such a good time.

46:53.640 --> 46:56.759
Really would be a shame
if you spoil it.

46:56.760 --> 47:00.199
