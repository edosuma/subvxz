00:02.693 --> 00:05.048
Okay, okay. Everybody,
listen up. Listen up!

00:05.213 --> 00:08.922
As acting manager while Jackie is away,
I'd like to announce a few changes.

00:09.093 --> 00:13.132
Now, due to the numerous requests,
the no tipping policy...

00:13.293 --> 00:15.090
...has been waived.

00:15.253 --> 00:16.367
Oh, hello.

00:16.533 --> 00:18.888
Don't forget to pick up
your applications...

00:19.053 --> 00:22.329
...for the new and exclusive
stockroom clerk.

00:23.453 --> 00:26.570
- So you're in charge now, huh, Will?
- Oh, sure, you're right.

00:26.733 --> 00:28.451
And you know what they say.

00:28.613 --> 00:30.683
Behind every successful man,
there's a woman.

00:30.853 --> 00:34.448
But if you wanted to switch positions,
I'm with that too, know what I mean?

00:34.613 --> 00:36.410
Hey. Hey, where are you going?

00:36.573 --> 00:38.882
Where are you going? Come here, girl.

00:39.933 --> 00:41.889
Oh, hey. Professor Milligan.

00:42.053 --> 00:44.328
How are you doing?
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

00:44.493 --> 00:47.166
You're coming down here
to swear me in as the new manager.

00:47.333 --> 00:48.891
You're making the right choice...

00:49.053 --> 00:51.328
...because as you can see,
this place is bumping.

00:51.493 --> 00:54.769
Maybe so, but sales aren't.
Take a look.

00:57.773 --> 01:00.207
You throw a good party, Will,
but nobody's spending.

01:00.373 --> 01:03.126
I'm afraid you're just
not management material.

01:03.493 --> 01:05.927
Wait. Hey, hey.

01:06.093 --> 01:09.927
Professor Mil. Hey, listen, listen.
You're not gonna let a silly little thing...

01:10.093 --> 01:12.971
...like profits stand in the way
of my promotion, are you?

01:13.173 --> 01:15.004
I'm sorry, I've already
made my decision.

01:15.173 --> 01:17.368
I'm bringing in one
of the most conscientious...

01:17.533 --> 01:19.444
...freshmen business students
for the job.

01:19.613 --> 01:22.525
Very meticulous.
Bakes me fresh muffins every day.

01:23.213 --> 01:24.441
No.

01:24.613 --> 01:27.969
No. No, he's not:

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.933 --> 02:55.403
- Well, where did you get this thing?
- They were passing them out at school.

02:55.573 --> 02:57.723
Hey, hey, hey. What's that?

02:57.933 --> 03:00.925
<i>The I Hate Hilary newsletter.</i>

03:02.253 --> 03:03.652
"Dedicated to the premise...

03:03.813 --> 03:08.204
...that weathercaster
Hilary Banks is a boob."

03:09.253 --> 03:11.813
Get to the insulting part.

03:12.853 --> 03:14.889
"Hilary Banks doesn't know
the difference...

03:15.053 --> 03:17.965
...between a cirrus cloud
and a cumulus cloud."

03:18.493 --> 03:19.721
What is the difference?

03:19.933 --> 03:23.972
Will, look around.
Do you see my TelePrompTer here?

03:25.373 --> 03:27.045
"Hilary's knowledge
of the weather...

03:27.253 --> 03:30.529
...is as skimpy as those ridiculous
outfits she wears on the air."

03:30.693 --> 03:33.730
I mean, it's one thing to attack
my performance, but my wardrobe?

03:33.893 --> 03:35.121
I don't think so.

03:37.573 --> 03:40.883
Yep, every business major at ULA
wanted The Peacock...

03:41.053 --> 03:43.521
...but my prospectus blew away
the competition.

03:43.693 --> 03:46.253
Who knows?
I could be the next Ross Perot.

03:47.013 --> 03:49.732
I don't know. Let's see.
Short, obnoxious.

03:49.893 --> 03:51.611
All you need is a bad haircut.

03:52.173 --> 03:53.845
And your ears.

03:58.653 --> 04:00.086
Well, I'm proud of you, son.

04:00.253 --> 04:02.926
Your first job, and you're
running the entire operation.

04:03.093 --> 04:04.321
That's right, big guy.

04:04.493 --> 04:08.850
There aren't too many first year students
with my level of savvy and maturity.

04:09.013 --> 04:11.129
Fruity Pebbles!

04:12.893 --> 04:15.851
And there's a little tugboat
inside, Ross.

04:18.533 --> 04:21.843
You know, Dad, the best part is,
this could be my ticket to Princeton.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.288
Professor Milligan says
that lvy League schools...

04:24.453 --> 04:26.967
...Iook pretty darn favorably
on management experience.

04:27.133 --> 04:30.284
How do they feel about guys who
still depend on the crossing guard?

04:30.453 --> 04:32.648
Hey, that's a dangerous
intersection, mister.

04:32.813 --> 04:34.690
- Quit putting your hands...
- Hey, hey!

04:34.893 --> 04:38.727
You two are gonna have to come to an
understanding and work this thing out.

04:39.693 --> 04:41.445
All right, all right.

04:41.613 --> 04:45.811
I'm... I'm willing
to try if you are, boss.

04:46.413 --> 04:48.404
Put it there, Smith.

04:51.853 --> 04:55.129
Well, Geoffrey, this might be
a very good experience for both of them.

04:55.293 --> 04:57.329
Especially Master William...

04:57.493 --> 05:02.613
...who will discover the joy
of working for a Banks.

05:08.293 --> 05:11.091
Hey, Professor Kemp,
Professor Meyers.

05:11.253 --> 05:13.050
Hey, Will, how are the subs today?

05:13.213 --> 05:15.807
Oh, well, you know,
sort of like your lectures.

05:16.013 --> 05:18.129
Long, stale and full of baloney.

05:20.173 --> 05:21.845
I'm stupid. I just failed, didn't I?

05:22.013 --> 05:24.288
Look, check it out,
here's a sub on the house.

05:24.453 --> 05:26.364
- Oh, thank you.
- All right.

05:26.533 --> 05:28.205
Instant A.

05:28.373 --> 05:30.045
What up, Dex?

05:30.213 --> 05:31.805
Hey, look, man.

05:31.973 --> 05:34.089
I saw Donna the other night
down at the quad...

05:34.253 --> 05:38.292
...and I told her breaking up with you
was the biggest mistake she ever made.

05:38.493 --> 05:41.565
- So she'll see me again?
- Oh, no, man, she hates your guts.

05:42.333 --> 05:45.769
Hey, but look, there's always
more fish in the sea.

05:45.933 --> 05:49.289
I should know.
They call me Aquaman.

05:53.493 --> 05:56.769
Well, I've spent the whole morning
back in the stockroom. What a mess.

05:56.933 --> 06:00.812
<i>Do you believe someone papered the
ceiling with hundreds of Jet beauties?</i>

06:00.973 --> 06:05.489
That's fly, ain't it? I like to think of it
as my own Sistine Chapel.

06:05.693 --> 06:09.129
Yeah, well, Phillipe's been in there
worshipping for two hours.

06:09.333 --> 06:12.325
Hey, hey, relax little fellow.
You'll get your turn.

06:13.693 --> 06:15.923
Hey, hey, hey. What up, dog?

06:16.453 --> 06:17.681
Dog?

06:17.853 --> 06:20.651
Will, this is a place of business,
not a kennel.

06:20.853 --> 06:23.572
Therefore, you will greet
each customer as follows:

06:23.733 --> 06:26.327
"Hello, I'm..." Your name here.

06:26.493 --> 06:28.484
"Welcome to The Peacock,
where our motto is:

06:28.653 --> 06:31.247
Whatever you want, we've got it."

06:31.853 --> 06:35.448
I'll give that a shot, Carlton.
Hey, hey, hey.

06:35.613 --> 06:38.685
My name's Will. Welcome
to The Peacock, where our motto is:

06:38.853 --> 06:41.686
Girl, whatever you got, I want it.

06:44.093 --> 06:45.765
Will, you're getting it all wrong.

06:45.933 --> 06:48.686
Hey, look, man,
as long as I'm getting it.

06:51.173 --> 06:53.209
Look, Will,
personal relationships aside...

06:53.373 --> 06:55.568
...I'm your boss,
and you have to listen to me.

06:58.573 --> 07:00.564
Oh, I'm sorry, Carlton,
you say something?

07:01.173 --> 07:04.085
May I remind you,
I'm the one issuing your paycheck?

07:04.293 --> 07:06.853
Yes, sir, General Shorcoff.

07:08.413 --> 07:10.847
That's the spirit, soldier.

07:14.693 --> 07:17.002
I am so frustrated.

07:17.173 --> 07:18.322
What's the matter?

07:18.493 --> 07:21.053
Mom and I wrote down a bunch
of meteorological terms...

07:21.213 --> 07:24.205
...for me to memorize,
and I keep screwing them up.

07:24.373 --> 07:26.409
Why didn't I become
an anchorperson?

07:26.573 --> 07:29.565
They don't have to know
hardly anything.

07:29.733 --> 07:32.406
It's commendable
that you wanna improve your skills.

07:32.573 --> 07:34.882
You don't have to impress
those newsletter people.

07:35.093 --> 07:36.492
I don't want to impress them.

07:36.653 --> 07:38.883
I want to smack them.

07:42.213 --> 07:44.010
Daddy...

07:45.013 --> 07:46.366
...you're a judge.

07:49.373 --> 07:52.809
Can't you just throw them in jail
or something?

07:54.093 --> 07:57.608
Sweetheart, the worst thing you can do
is blow this thing out of proportion.

07:57.773 --> 08:00.333
Now, if you ignore it,
it will probably go away.

08:00.973 --> 08:05.489
Did you really refer
to Hurricane Robert as Bobby?

08:06.813 --> 08:08.804
Well, Robert just sounded so serious.

08:08.973 --> 08:10.531
It was serious, darling.

08:10.693 --> 08:12.729
It wiped out half of Miami.

08:12.933 --> 08:16.892
Well, excuse me for trying
to spread a little sunshine.

08:18.853 --> 08:22.289
Daddy, I just can't stand
the idea of people hating me.

08:22.453 --> 08:24.842
Hilary, people love
to attack celebrities.

08:25.013 --> 08:27.766
It's part of the price you pay
for being in the public eye.

08:27.933 --> 08:30.766
You're right. I'm gonna call someone
who's been through this.

08:30.933 --> 08:32.126
Who's that, honey?

08:32.293 --> 08:34.328
Someone who knows
what it's like to be hated.

08:34.493 --> 08:37.371
555-9021.

08:37.533 --> 08:39.727
Oh, Shannen?

08:39.893 --> 08:42.123
Hi. Hilary Banks.

08:42.293 --> 08:45.888
<i>You remember that I Hate Brenda thing
that you went through?</i>

08:46.053 --> 08:47.725
What do you mean
you don't know me?

08:47.893 --> 08:50.691
You spilled a drink on me at Roxbury.

08:52.173 --> 08:53.606
Hello?

08:53.773 --> 08:55.491
Hello?

08:56.693 --> 09:00.288
Boy, she's not gonna make
many friends with that attitude.

09:01.973 --> 09:05.283
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm Carlton Banks, Peacock manager.

09:05.453 --> 09:08.126
And I'm afraid these tables
are for eating not loitering.

09:08.293 --> 09:10.090
- We did eat.
- Yes, you did.

09:10.253 --> 09:12.005
Seven minutes ago.

09:12.213 --> 09:14.010
Are you saying we have to leave?

09:14.213 --> 09:17.125
No, no, no. You can stay
if you order something else.

09:17.293 --> 09:21.252
Look, I particularly recommend
the shrimpy cocktail.

09:25.133 --> 09:27.044
Will, I could use a little help out here.

09:27.213 --> 09:29.124
I ain't coming out, man!

09:29.293 --> 09:32.091
Fine, then you're not getting paid.

09:32.253 --> 09:33.766
Damn.

09:40.373 --> 09:44.048
Carlton, I think we need to have
a little talk, man. You know...

09:44.213 --> 09:46.329
...bird to nerd.

09:46.773 --> 09:48.206
Sorry, I'm busy.

09:49.133 --> 09:51.488
So, ladies, have you decided?

09:52.053 --> 09:55.045
- Drop dead.
- Excellent choice.

09:56.253 --> 09:57.481
Look around, man.

09:57.653 --> 10:00.565
The Peacock is a place where people
just come to kick it, man.

10:00.733 --> 10:03.372
To relax. You know, get away
from the pressures of class.

10:03.533 --> 10:05.967
If you start hassling them,
they'll go somewhere else.

10:06.133 --> 10:09.682
Where? The closest competition
is three blocks off campus.

10:09.853 --> 10:11.605
Look, don't you see, Will?

10:11.773 --> 10:13.570
We've got these people
by the textbooks.

10:13.733 --> 10:17.646
We can charge and pretty much
do whatever we want.

10:18.853 --> 10:21.321
This is like sex to you, isn't it?

10:21.613 --> 10:23.410
Yes.

10:24.493 --> 10:26.882
Well, you know what?
It doesn't turn me on, Carlton.

10:27.053 --> 10:28.452
I think you're being an idiot.

10:36.013 --> 10:38.447
What do you think you're gonna do
with that, mister?

10:38.653 --> 10:41.451
Marking up the prices, Will.

10:42.653 --> 10:45.008
Can't let you do that, Carlton.

10:45.173 --> 10:47.243
These people are students.

10:47.453 --> 10:49.648
They're good people.

10:50.053 --> 10:51.771
Decent people.

10:51.933 --> 10:54.811
They can't afford to pay any more.

10:55.013 --> 10:57.732
Save it for someone who cares.

10:58.853 --> 11:00.650
Freeze, man!

11:03.133 --> 11:05.647
Do what you got to do, cowboy.

11:17.613 --> 11:19.331
Hey, give me back my gun.

11:19.533 --> 11:20.761
Listen, as your boss...

11:20.933 --> 11:23.652
...I'm not gonna tolerate
that kind of insubordination.

11:23.853 --> 11:25.047
You're not my boss.

11:25.213 --> 11:28.410
You're just some butt-kissing,
apple-a-day suck up that got lucky.

11:29.013 --> 11:30.162
Oh, that's it.

11:30.333 --> 11:33.405
That little outburst is going
to cost you a reduction in hours.

11:33.573 --> 11:34.926
Well, I'll do you one better.

11:35.093 --> 11:37.653
How about zero hours? I quit!

11:38.293 --> 11:41.251
Oh, yeah? Well, well...

11:41.453 --> 11:44.331
Don't ask me
for any recommendation.

11:52.053 --> 11:54.442
I know Will's mad,
but this is ridiculous.

11:54.613 --> 11:57.081
I mean, he hasn't talked to me
in two days.

11:57.253 --> 11:58.766
What do you think I should do?

11:58.933 --> 12:01.128
Count your blessings.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.810
Hey, what's up...

12:04.493 --> 12:06.051
...G?

12:06.413 --> 12:07.687
- Will.
- No, no.

12:09.413 --> 12:12.803
Will, you can't keep... me.

12:13.573 --> 12:15.882
It's... not:

12:16.813 --> 12:18.292
That's what I said:

12:20.053 --> 12:21.611
Well, you can't even... right.

12:22.773 --> 12:25.492
Stay out of my face, man.
I'm still not speaking to you.

12:25.693 --> 12:27.524
Fine, be that way.

12:27.733 --> 12:29.291
Master William...

12:29.453 --> 12:32.684
...I've never seen you
behave so coldly.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.809
I like it.

12:35.813 --> 12:38.327
Well, G, a man
has got to stand his ground.

12:38.533 --> 12:41.923
A man also has to work
to pay his bills.

12:42.093 --> 12:45.768
Otherwise, I'd be out
parasailing with these.

12:46.413 --> 12:48.608
Seriously, what are you going
to do for money?

12:48.773 --> 12:50.206
Already taken care of, G.

12:50.373 --> 12:52.568
Got me a brand new job,
three blocks off campus.

12:52.733 --> 12:54.689
The Chestless Touchdown.

12:55.453 --> 12:56.772
This is an outrage.

12:56.973 --> 12:59.646
Look, Uncle Phil, I swear
that dent was in that car...

12:59.813 --> 13:01.132
...before I hit that mailbox!

13:01.293 --> 13:03.966
- What dent?
- Exactly. So, what were you saying?

13:04.573 --> 13:08.088
Those newsletter bozos put up a big
"Honk, if you hate Hilary" billboard...

13:08.253 --> 13:10.721
...right at the corner
of Sunset and Doheny.

13:10.933 --> 13:14.209
Oh, damn. That mean they took down
the Naughty Nightie girl.

13:15.293 --> 13:16.726
Hilary!

13:17.293 --> 13:18.362
Hilary!

13:18.853 --> 13:22.243
<i>More snow today with temperatures
dropping to the low teens this evening.</i>

13:22.413 --> 13:24.688
- Sweetheart, l...
- Daddy, I have the greatest idea.

13:24.853 --> 13:26.571
If I watch the weather in New York...

13:26.733 --> 13:29.531
...I'll have a three-hour jump
on the competition.

13:29.693 --> 13:33.083
Honey, that might not work
every time.

13:33.253 --> 13:36.086
Listen, when you drove
to work today...

13:36.253 --> 13:39.086
...you didn't by any chance go down
Sunset Boulevard, did you?

13:39.253 --> 13:41.244
Oh, I couldn't.
It was backed up for miles.

13:41.413 --> 13:44.689
And everyone was honking
like it was New Year's Eve.

13:46.493 --> 13:50.327
Chance of snow
and a minus three wind chill.

13:50.853 --> 13:53.128
Well, my work is done.
I'm going shopping.

13:53.613 --> 13:56.571
Sweetheart, I've thought it over,
you know, and you're right.

13:56.733 --> 13:58.803
I'm gonna put an end
this newsletter business.

13:58.973 --> 14:02.568
In fact, I'm gonna head down
to the law library and get right to work.

14:02.733 --> 14:04.769
Thank you, Daddy.

14:05.253 --> 14:07.084
Now, dress warm, it's gonna snow.

14:16.253 --> 14:17.322
Please don't go.

14:17.533 --> 14:20.411
Look, I apologize for performing
the Heimlich maneuver on you.

14:20.573 --> 14:22.325
I really thought you were choking.

14:28.933 --> 14:32.767
And now, to create
a more festive mood...

14:32.933 --> 14:35.970
...The Peacock is proud to present
music from Hawaii.

14:36.813 --> 14:40.203
The entertainment charge
has already been added into your check.

15:01.653 --> 15:04.326
Also, we are pleased to announce...

15:04.533 --> 15:06.763
...that the proceeds
from our new pay toilets...

15:06.933 --> 15:10.482
...have enabled us to buy
this brand new metal detector.

15:10.653 --> 15:14.248
Remember, less flatware theft
means lower prices for you...

15:14.413 --> 15:16.643
...our valued consumer.

15:38.453 --> 15:41.763
Man, they ought to draw
a chalk outline around this place.

15:41.933 --> 15:44.049
Hey, Jazz.

15:45.133 --> 15:49.046
So, what can I get you?
A sandwich? A T-shirt?

15:50.013 --> 15:51.241
Peacock-a-cola?

15:51.413 --> 15:54.450
- I made that one up myself.
- It shows.

15:54.653 --> 15:56.769
Actually, I just came by to see Will.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.604
Mr. Smith is no longer employed here.

16:00.933 --> 16:03.493
Looks like he took everybody
with him too.

16:03.653 --> 16:07.248
They didn't leave because of Will.
They left because of me.

16:07.413 --> 16:12.533
I mean, they just need time to get
acclimated to some of my new policies.

16:12.693 --> 16:17.084
Phillipe told me you cut the teeth marks
off the pickles and reuse them.

16:18.573 --> 16:20.484
Look, Jazz, I'm in real trouble.

16:20.653 --> 16:22.883
My professor's coming down
to check on business.

16:23.053 --> 16:26.363
You know a lot of people.
Maybe you can bring some of them by.

16:26.533 --> 16:28.285
What's in it for me?

16:28.853 --> 16:30.525
Well...

16:31.053 --> 16:35.046
...you know how your pigeons
are always getting sick all the time?

16:35.253 --> 16:37.050
My babies.

16:37.373 --> 16:39.603
I'll pay their vet bill
for the rest of the year.

16:39.773 --> 16:42.845
Even Oliver? He has a heart murmur.

16:43.613 --> 16:46.332
- Even Oliver.
- Be back in an hour.

17:10.012 --> 17:11.526
Jazz, what is this?

17:11.733 --> 17:13.325
Pretty good job, huh?

17:13.492 --> 17:17.691
It's nice to have friends you can
call on at the last minute. Oliver.

17:23.093 --> 17:25.971
Banks! What is going on here?

17:26.133 --> 17:27.361
Professor Milligan.

17:27.573 --> 17:29.609
Well, see, sir.

17:30.213 --> 17:34.092
I've managed
to diversify our clientele.

17:34.253 --> 17:39.202
If anybody asks,
I've been with you all day.

17:40.773 --> 17:43.082
Banks, I don't know
what you've done to this place.

17:43.253 --> 17:47.041
But whatever it is, I suggest that you
fix it, or I'll yank you off this project.

17:47.573 --> 17:50.371
But... But, sir, what...?

17:55.813 --> 17:59.010
Jazz, you better get those freaks
out of here immediately.

17:59.213 --> 18:00.965
You're the boss.

18:03.373 --> 18:06.331
All right, you weirdos, beat it.

18:10.293 --> 18:11.806
Daddy, I've got some news.

18:11.973 --> 18:14.362
So do I. I've filed
the necessary court papers.

18:14.533 --> 18:16.569
We'll have that newsletter
killed in no time.

18:16.773 --> 18:18.729
Daddy, don't you dare.

18:18.933 --> 18:21.163
My ratings this week
have gone through the roof.

18:21.333 --> 18:25.042
They're even talking about letting me
announce the lottery number.

18:25.253 --> 18:26.811
Well, what about your reputation?

18:26.973 --> 18:29.248
So, what if a few people
don't like me? I'm a hit.

18:29.853 --> 18:32.765
Sweetheart, think about this.
Is this the kind of fame you want?

18:32.933 --> 18:35.925
People are gonna be tuning in,
not to hear your weather report...

18:36.093 --> 18:37.651
...but looking for a laugh.

18:38.773 --> 18:40.491
Hello?

18:41.293 --> 18:43.124
You're kidding.

18:43.293 --> 18:45.488
Well, of course, I'm interested.

18:45.693 --> 18:47.365
Who was that?

18:47.533 --> 18:50.650
They're thinking of making me
an anchorperson.

18:54.973 --> 18:56.725
I've gotta brush up.

18:56.893 --> 18:59.805
Who is this Bosnia person
I keep hearing about?

19:03.653 --> 19:07.612
Forty-eight, 49, 50.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.247
Have fun with them potatoes, spud.

19:11.053 --> 19:12.964
Oh, hey.

19:20.693 --> 19:24.083
Will, I've thought about it,
and I can't let you do this to yourself.

19:24.253 --> 19:27.245
Hey, come on, Carlton. Come back
when I'm on a break, all right?

19:29.133 --> 19:31.601
Excuse me, may I cut in?

19:33.773 --> 19:36.333
Carlton, what are you doing?
This is a sports bar, man.

19:36.933 --> 19:40.209
Will, I know you only left The Peacock
because of your foolish pride.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.563
No, I left because
of my foolish cousin.

19:43.053 --> 19:45.442
Will, you can't be happy here.
This is a franchise.

19:45.613 --> 19:47.763
The kind of place
where they treat employees...

19:47.933 --> 19:50.128
...like faceless, anonymous nobodies.

19:51.613 --> 19:54.207
Will Smith, come on up here.

19:54.413 --> 19:56.449
I know you've only been here
four days...

19:56.613 --> 20:01.289
...but the staff has voted you
employee of the week!

20:02.853 --> 20:04.809
Let's have a hand for Will Smith, huh?

20:09.493 --> 20:10.528
And by the way...

20:10.693 --> 20:14.971
...for winning this honor,
you get the weekend off with pay.

20:15.133 --> 20:18.011
- Hey, hey, hey.
- All right.

20:20.013 --> 20:23.528
Oh, Carlton,
save me from this hellhole.

20:25.053 --> 20:27.487
Okay, Will, I was willing
to let bygones be bygones.

20:27.653 --> 20:29.962
But I can see it's no use.

20:32.493 --> 20:33.926
It is no use, right?

20:36.733 --> 20:38.246
Fine.

20:38.853 --> 20:41.003
I guess the dream is over.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.562
I'm obviously
not management material.

20:45.013 --> 20:48.688
All those summers at business camp
were just a waste of time.

20:49.413 --> 20:51.768
Oh, Carlton, hold up, man.

20:51.933 --> 20:53.491
Look, you're not a bad manager.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.564
You just stink
when it comes to people.

20:55.733 --> 20:57.644
And you stink
when it comes to business.

20:57.813 --> 20:59.132
So, what does that tell you?

20:59.293 --> 21:01.011
That we both stink.

21:01.213 --> 21:02.771
Yes, individually.

21:02.973 --> 21:05.362
But together we'd smell like success.

21:06.573 --> 21:08.291
What do you say, Will?

21:10.213 --> 21:11.965
No, man. I got a good thing here.

21:12.373 --> 21:14.409
Come on, Will.
I'll make it worth your while.

21:14.573 --> 21:17.690
I'll give you priority shifts,
and you can wear your own clothes...

21:17.853 --> 21:20.492
...and you've got unlimited use
of the stockroom.

21:20.653 --> 21:25.010
- No, man.
- Well, what do you want, Will?

21:25.373 --> 21:28.490
You know, I kind of
want you to beg me.

21:28.693 --> 21:32.402
Beg? I don't know how to beg.
I'm rich.

21:32.613 --> 21:35.730
Look, Will, I'll give you $ 1000
if you come back.

21:37.133 --> 21:38.725
Gosh, you don't get it, do you?

21:39.333 --> 21:43.167
Carlton, it isn't always
about facts and figures...

21:43.333 --> 21:46.325
...and green pieces of paper
with dead presidents on them.

21:47.333 --> 21:51.485
Look, a man's most valuable
possession is his self-respect.

21:52.973 --> 21:55.441
- Make it 2000.
- All right, let me go get my hat.

22:03.933 --> 22:06.128
Hey, hey, hey.

22:06.293 --> 22:08.807
Professor Mil, chill.
Hey, listen, man.

22:08.973 --> 22:11.089
Look... Now...

22:11.253 --> 22:13.892
Listen, hey, listen.

22:14.053 --> 22:15.771
- Hey.
- No, hey.

22:15.933 --> 22:18.572
- Hey, well, listen.
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:18.733 --> 22:19.961
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:20.133 --> 22:22.124
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:22.573 --> 22:24.848
Hey, hey, I got it. Okay, I've got it.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.442
You ready? Let's pick it up
from right there.
