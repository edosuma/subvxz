WEBVTT

00:02.297 --> 00:04.006
OK, old garage, what wonders

00:04.007 --> 00:06.206
do you have for me
to discover today?

00:06.207 --> 00:08.796
Hey, "Ralphie Rodent's
Birthday Bash"?

00:08.797 --> 00:11.876
But Dad and Tilly said this
got run over by the lawnmower!

00:11.877 --> 00:14.046
Happy happy birthday birthday!
Happy happy birthday birthday!
Happy happy birthday birthday!

00:14.047 --> 00:16.337
Ugh! OK, actually
that is pretty annoying.

00:19.127 --> 00:21.876
[gasps] Gramma's old-person
mobility scooter?

00:21.877 --> 00:25.006
Hoo boy,
I could have some fun with this!

00:25.007 --> 00:26.666
Wait, what would Dad say about

00:26.667 --> 00:29.506
such a new, fun
and exciting idea?

00:29.507 --> 00:30.756
Hmm...

00:30.757 --> 00:33.626
No! No fun ever! I hate fun!

00:33.627 --> 00:35.626
No!

00:35.627 --> 00:38.006
[gasps] That sounds
just like him!

00:38.007 --> 00:40.166
If I'm gonna ride that thing
without Dad knowin',

00:40.167 --> 00:42.666
I gotta be real careful.

00:42.667 --> 00:45.007
[humming]

00:47.007 --> 00:49.166
[chuckles] That's what
I'm talkin' about.

00:49.167 --> 00:51.376
OK, now what's the button
that makes this thing go--

00:51.377 --> 00:53.336
[screams]

00:53.337 --> 00:54.337
[groans]

00:54.338 --> 00:56.166
[laughs]

00:56.167 --> 00:58.626
I must've gotten like ten feet
of lift off that thi--

00:58.627 --> 01:00.666
Whoa! Oh, my gosh!

01:00.667 --> 01:01.667
Dad's garden!

01:05.047 --> 01:07.167
Oh, what have I done?

01:09.257 --> 01:10.876
Well, at least
everyone's asleep, right?

01:10.877 --> 01:11.966
[Bill]
What the heck was that?

01:11.967 --> 01:13.756
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

01:13.757 --> 01:16.416
I don't know what could've
made all that racket--

01:16.417 --> 01:17.876
[all gasp]

01:17.877 --> 01:21.546
No. No! No!

01:21.547 --> 01:25.126
All right, Cricket, if you wanna
survive the wrath of Dad's anger

01:25.127 --> 01:28.966
this is gonna have to be
your best performance ever.

01:28.967 --> 01:29.967
My crops!

01:29.968 --> 01:31.466
Who would do such a thing?!

01:31.467 --> 01:33.046
[panting]

01:33.047 --> 01:35.546
Oh, my gosh!
What happened?!

01:35.547 --> 01:37.466
Cricket! What did you do?!

01:37.467 --> 01:40.546
Me? Oh, yeah,
it's always Cricket!

01:40.547 --> 01:42.546
You're givin' me a complex.

01:42.547 --> 01:44.416
Because it is always you!

01:44.417 --> 01:46.506
This time it isn't!
I swear!

01:46.507 --> 01:48.876
This is far too big a mess
for a little guy like me!

01:48.877 --> 01:52.466
No, no, no, no, no, no,
this was something much bigger!

01:52.467 --> 01:56.706
There are mysteries
in this world our little minds
just can't understand!

01:56.707 --> 01:58.917
Who knows what's out there?!

02:00.627 --> 02:01.796
Like aliens?

02:01.797 --> 02:02.797
Yes.

02:02.798 --> 02:04.796
It was aliens!

02:04.797 --> 02:06.416
- Aliens.
- Aliens.

02:06.417 --> 02:07.796
Aliens?!

02:07.797 --> 02:09.796
This must be one of those...
[gasps]

02:09.797 --> 02:12.256
...crop circle thingies.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.756
[both]
Crop circle thingies.

02:13.757 --> 02:16.336
OK, that is enough!
Aliens aren't real.

02:16.337 --> 02:19.006
You know how susceptible
these two are to suggestion.

02:19.007 --> 02:20.756
I believe the boy.

02:20.757 --> 02:23.336
Aliens are literally the only
explanation that makes sense.

02:23.337 --> 02:25.086
Dad, Dad, the truth
is not down here.

02:25.087 --> 02:27.586
The truth is out there.

02:27.587 --> 02:30.796
OK. Everyone back inside.

02:30.797 --> 02:33.546
Cricket, I don't know
how you ruined the garden.

02:33.547 --> 02:36.046
But I'm gonna figure it out.

02:36.047 --> 02:37.296
[gulps]

02:37.297 --> 02:38.506
All right, Cricket.

02:38.507 --> 02:39.796
Tonight was a small victory,

02:39.797 --> 02:41.506
but a victory nonetheless.

02:41.507 --> 02:45.296
Just gotta stay the course
and double down on my lie.

02:45.297 --> 02:47.416
[rooster crows]

02:47.417 --> 02:49.416
[Tilly] Hopefully these
will reach their spaceship.

02:49.417 --> 02:51.006
I wanna be on their good side.

02:51.007 --> 02:52.626
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

02:52.627 --> 02:55.296
Guys! You do realize
it's Cricket, right?

02:55.297 --> 02:57.666
The aliens eat
the nonbelievers first.

02:57.667 --> 02:58.916
Ugh.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.416
I know it was Cricket.

03:00.417 --> 03:01.966
I just gotta prove it.

03:01.967 --> 03:04.706
There must be something
I'm missing. Hmm...

03:04.707 --> 03:06.256
What you're missing
is the truth.

03:06.257 --> 03:08.126
And it's aliens.
[munching]

03:08.127 --> 03:09.796
Who are you
and why are you here?

03:09.797 --> 03:11.206
Dad, this is Andromeda!

03:11.207 --> 03:13.006
Oh, yeah, Tilly's friend.

03:13.007 --> 03:14.586
And alien expert!

03:14.587 --> 03:17.586
Andromeda! Did you see that
aliens visited our house?

03:17.587 --> 03:20.256
I did, and it's awesome!

03:20.257 --> 03:21.416
OK, great.

03:21.417 --> 03:23.006
So, Andromeda,

03:23.007 --> 03:24.836
what's your read on
this whole situation?

03:24.837 --> 03:26.336
Hold my cheese poofs.

03:26.337 --> 03:28.836
[robotic voice]
Alien scan initiating!

03:28.837 --> 03:30.416
Beep! Beep!

03:30.417 --> 03:33.416
Zwoop! Zwoop! Zwibbity zwalien!
Show me the alien!

03:33.417 --> 03:36.506
- Hmm...
- So, what does it say?

03:36.507 --> 03:39.336
The aliens were here and they
want to lay their egg sacs
in your garden.

03:39.337 --> 03:42.506
[gasps]
We're gonna be daddies!

03:42.507 --> 03:46.206
Cricket, I am giving you
to the count of ten
to come clean and confess!

03:46.207 --> 03:49.046
OK! Thank you, Andromeda!
Time to go home!

03:49.047 --> 03:51.876
OK, Dad's not believin' it.

03:51.877 --> 03:54.376
Don't worry. The government
will be here soon.

03:54.377 --> 03:57.546
Hmm... government, you say?

03:57.547 --> 03:59.796
[groans]
Poor little ear of corn.

03:59.797 --> 04:01.046
Ya never had a chance.

04:01.047 --> 04:02.587
You gonna cry?

04:04.547 --> 04:05.547
Hmm...

04:05.547 --> 04:06.547
[nibbles]

04:06.548 --> 04:07.916
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

04:07.917 --> 04:10.586
- [whispering]
- Hmm?

04:10.587 --> 04:13.206
- [whispering]
- Uh, excuse me...

04:13.207 --> 04:15.046
Excuse me. Hello?

04:15.047 --> 04:16.966
Where were you at
exactly 11:00 PM last night?!

04:16.967 --> 04:18.506
What?
What kind of a question is--

04:18.507 --> 04:19.916
Did you see any
suspicious activity?

04:19.917 --> 04:22.086
Any lights? Any bright,
bright lights at night?

04:22.087 --> 04:24.086
-I--I--
-Any giant glassy eyeballs?

04:24.087 --> 04:25.966
Perhaps compound, like a bug's?

04:25.967 --> 04:28.256
Well, it's possible
I missed something, but I...

04:28.257 --> 04:31.046
I mean, no! Of course I didn't
see anything like that!

04:31.047 --> 04:32.876
That's right,
you didn't see anything.

04:32.877 --> 04:34.256
What? Aah!

04:34.257 --> 04:35.416
Now you can't just--

04:35.417 --> 04:36.586
What the?

04:36.587 --> 04:39.466
- He just... disappeared.
- [panting]

04:39.467 --> 04:41.466
Oh, man, great job!

04:41.467 --> 04:43.836
Thank you, Master Cricket.

04:43.837 --> 04:46.916
That was some pretty
convincing acting, Vasquez.
How'd you do it?

04:46.917 --> 04:48.586
I'm taking a class
in dramatic theater

04:48.587 --> 04:49.916
at my community college.

04:49.917 --> 04:51.666
- Ooh!
- Very nice!

04:51.667 --> 04:55.006
Well, let's see if
my big Billy fish is bitin'.

04:55.007 --> 04:56.916
I'm tellin' ya
it was real strange!

04:56.917 --> 04:59.086
The man was snoopin' around,
takin' photos,

04:59.087 --> 05:00.706
and then he just
vanished into thin air!

05:00.707 --> 05:02.506
This whole thing
is like somethin'...

05:02.507 --> 05:03.836
Somethin' from another world?

05:03.837 --> 05:05.296
Yes, Papa, it's aliens.

05:05.297 --> 05:07.046
Yes! I mean, no!

05:07.047 --> 05:09.256
Look, I'm tryin' to say
I'm startin' to think

05:09.257 --> 05:11.206
the damage wasn't caused
by Cricket!

05:11.207 --> 05:13.296
[gasps] Oh, he's buyin' it!

05:13.297 --> 05:14.586
[growling]

05:14.587 --> 05:16.086
Oh, whatcha got there, girl?

05:16.087 --> 05:17.127
Oh, no!

05:23.587 --> 05:25.916
Oh. What a shame.

05:25.917 --> 05:28.206
Tilly, where is your brother?

05:28.207 --> 05:32.006
Oh, he said he was real tired
and just went runnin'
and runnin' away.

05:32.007 --> 05:33.336
He ran to bed!

05:33.337 --> 05:34.586
[Gramma]
Must've been pretty tired.

05:34.587 --> 05:35.966
It's only 4:00 PM.

05:35.967 --> 05:37.127
Mm-hmm.

05:39.547 --> 05:40.666
Hello, son.

05:40.667 --> 05:43.296
Going to bed early, I see.

05:43.297 --> 05:46.046
Nothing's more important
than a full eight hours.

05:46.047 --> 05:47.506
[whimpering]

05:47.507 --> 05:50.297
Rest up. You're gonna need it
for tomorrow.

05:51.797 --> 05:54.166
[whispers]
Good night, son.

05:54.167 --> 05:55.167
[kiss]

05:58.167 --> 06:00.206
[exhales]
Oh, man, come mornin',

06:00.207 --> 06:02.666
I'm gonna be in
a royal heap of trouble!

06:02.667 --> 06:04.546
If I'm gonna have
any chance of survival,

06:04.547 --> 06:06.966
I need to get Dad
to believe in aliens.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.007
Tonight!

06:09.337 --> 06:10.466
Huh?

06:10.467 --> 06:11.587
What the?

06:14.297 --> 06:15.417
Hello?

06:16.797 --> 06:18.876
Hello? Who's out there?

06:18.877 --> 06:21.206
Bill.

06:21.207 --> 06:23.046
Oh, my gosh! It can't be!

06:23.047 --> 06:24.047
It is!

06:24.048 --> 06:26.466
I'm a real live alien!

06:26.467 --> 06:28.006
Now that you see that I'm real,

06:28.007 --> 06:29.876
there's no need
to punish your son!

06:29.877 --> 06:31.546
I destroyed your garden!

06:31.547 --> 06:32.836
But--but I thought
Cricket rode the scooter.

06:32.837 --> 06:34.546
I rode the scooter!

06:34.547 --> 06:36.796
Tell me this ain't real!
Tell me I'm dreamin'!

06:36.797 --> 06:39.126
If I wasn't real,
could I do this?

06:39.127 --> 06:42.416
Ah! It is real! Aliens are real!

06:42.417 --> 06:44.086
Yes, but the important part

06:44.087 --> 06:46.546
is that your son
did not do anything wrong!

06:46.547 --> 06:49.876
Well, it's been nice chatting,
but the mothership awaits!

06:49.877 --> 06:52.046
Oh, my gosh!

06:52.047 --> 06:54.466
We're not alone!

06:54.467 --> 06:57.086
[rooster crows]

06:57.087 --> 06:59.126
Now to see if my plan worked...

06:59.127 --> 07:01.966
Ahh, what a wonderful night
of sleep!

07:01.967 --> 07:04.836
And how's my fine family
doin' on this fine mornin'?

07:04.837 --> 07:08.046
Hey, did anyone see
those crazy lights last night?

07:08.047 --> 07:09.417
Weird, huh?

07:10.417 --> 07:11.506
Hello, son.

07:11.507 --> 07:13.126
Come eat your mashed potatoes.

07:13.127 --> 07:16.376
[slurps] Mashed potatoes
for breakfast? OK...

07:16.377 --> 07:18.666
It's all become
so clear to me now.

07:18.667 --> 07:21.416
This is the alien
I saw last night.

07:21.417 --> 07:25.706
And this is me having
every illusion I've ever held
shattered.

07:25.707 --> 07:28.546
Well, I'm glad all that
is resolved now.

07:28.547 --> 07:30.756
And we can all
just go back to normal.

07:30.757 --> 07:34.166
Yes. Normal.

07:34.167 --> 07:36.256
Huh. I like what you're sayin'.

07:36.257 --> 07:38.586
Not so much
how you're sayin' it...

07:38.587 --> 07:41.416
Son, you've really
opened my eyes.

07:41.417 --> 07:44.256
If you say so.

07:44.257 --> 07:45.257
[gasps]

07:45.258 --> 07:46.506
Did ya hear the news?

07:46.507 --> 07:48.666
Your dad believes in aliens now!

07:48.667 --> 07:50.916
He had some kind of awakenin'
in his sleep!

07:50.917 --> 07:52.586
He finally came to the light.

07:52.587 --> 07:54.586
Yes. Yes, it's real good.

07:54.587 --> 07:56.506
Uh, but let's go back
to talkin' about normal stuff.

07:56.507 --> 07:57.916
Just bein' real normal.

07:57.917 --> 08:00.206
Uh, Tilly,
what's ol' Saxon up to?

08:00.207 --> 08:03.166
Saxon is ready for the arrival,
Cricket. Are you?

08:03.167 --> 08:04.916
Now put your brain shield on.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.336
- Uh...
- [panting]

08:06.337 --> 08:07.506
Was that Dad?!

08:07.507 --> 08:08.586
Oh, no!

08:08.587 --> 08:09.666
Everyone!

08:09.667 --> 08:11.796
We are not alone
in the universe!

08:11.797 --> 08:13.757
Aliens are real!

08:15.007 --> 08:16.876
Oh, no, I broke Dad's brain!

08:16.877 --> 08:18.966
[gasps] Christmas!

08:18.967 --> 08:20.706
- [screams]
- Everyday is Christmas
when the aliens are here!

08:20.707 --> 08:21.796
You're not Santa!

08:21.797 --> 08:23.006
Spread the good news!

08:23.007 --> 08:24.916
- Ma'am! Aliens!
- [screams]

08:24.917 --> 08:26.916
Come on, folks! Where ya goin'?

08:26.917 --> 08:28.046
No one's listenin' to me.

08:28.047 --> 08:30.166
I'll just have to scream louder!

08:30.167 --> 08:33.586
Uh, Dad, let's just keep
the aliens to ourselves
for a little while.

08:33.587 --> 08:34.966
Oh, no, not the roof!

08:34.967 --> 08:36.376
[panting] Gramma, help!

08:36.377 --> 08:38.206
Oh, why are you
in your underwear?!

08:38.207 --> 08:40.466
It's less resistance
for the tractor beam!

08:40.467 --> 08:42.256
Hey, atta boy, Billy boy!

08:42.257 --> 08:43.416
Spread the good word!

08:43.417 --> 08:44.706
You guys aren't helping!

08:44.707 --> 08:46.586
The aliens are my overlords now.

08:46.587 --> 08:50.756
And I am hereby revoking
my life of a humble farmer

08:50.757 --> 08:53.296
to be a servant
for our alien masters!

08:53.297 --> 08:54.586
Who is with me?!

08:54.587 --> 08:55.966
- What?!
- [people laughing]

08:55.967 --> 08:57.706
Look at this guy!
What a fool!

08:57.707 --> 08:59.256
I gotta help him. [panting]

08:59.257 --> 09:00.416
[grunts]

09:00.417 --> 09:01.756
Now I don't know what

09:01.757 --> 09:03.586
the bathroom situation
is on Mars so...

09:03.587 --> 09:05.416
[inhales]
try to go before we leave!

09:05.417 --> 09:09.336
Bill. You're freaking out
everyone that loves you!

09:09.337 --> 09:10.506
You came back!

09:10.507 --> 09:12.086
The others won't believe me!

09:12.087 --> 09:13.586
You can eat them first.

09:13.587 --> 09:14.587
Everyone!

09:14.588 --> 09:16.086
The alien's returned!

09:16.087 --> 09:17.506
I was tellin' the truth!

09:17.507 --> 09:19.206
This just keeps getting better!

09:19.207 --> 09:20.876
[all laughing]

09:20.877 --> 09:21.916
Uh...

09:21.917 --> 09:23.166
Now if everyone could please

09:23.167 --> 09:25.416
strip down for the tractor beam!

09:25.417 --> 09:26.466
Good-bye, Earth.

09:26.467 --> 09:28.046
Dad! Dad, listen!

09:28.047 --> 09:29.587
Ah, he's too far gone!

09:30.797 --> 09:32.547
[grunts] What the?

09:33.547 --> 09:35.046
Dad, there was no alien!

09:35.047 --> 09:36.166
It was me!

09:36.167 --> 09:38.086
I lied about the whole thing!

09:38.087 --> 09:39.087
[all gasp]

09:39.088 --> 09:40.256
I rode the scooter!

09:40.257 --> 09:41.586
I destroyed your garden!

09:41.587 --> 09:43.666
I put on stilts
and an alien costume

09:43.667 --> 09:44.667
and I lied!

09:44.668 --> 09:46.706
I lied, I lied, I lied!

09:46.707 --> 09:49.546
I'm so sorry! I just didn't
wanna get in trouble!

09:49.547 --> 09:52.047
Oh, please say something!
Anything!

09:54.837 --> 09:56.586
I flip-flappin' knew it.

09:56.587 --> 09:57.876
W-What?!

09:57.877 --> 10:01.296
Gotcha! Woo-hoo!

10:01.297 --> 10:03.706
You look so ridiculous
right now!

10:03.707 --> 10:05.546
Ma, catch our little alien.

10:05.547 --> 10:07.756
I gotta say,
I did not see this comin'.

10:07.757 --> 10:10.756
Son, isn't it so much easier
to tell the truth?

10:10.757 --> 10:14.126
It would've saved us both
a whole lotta trouble
if you'd just admitted it.

10:14.127 --> 10:15.506
[stammering]

10:15.507 --> 10:17.836
Oh, you got me good, Dad.

10:17.837 --> 10:20.006
You're such a great actor, Papa!

10:20.007 --> 10:23.126
You knew aliens didn't exist
the whole time?

10:23.127 --> 10:26.126
Heh, yep...
the whole time.

10:26.127 --> 10:28.006
All right,
let's all just get inside.

10:28.007 --> 10:29.256
Wow. That's it?

10:29.257 --> 10:30.917
Well, that was a weird ending.
