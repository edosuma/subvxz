01:09.078 --> 01:10.781
<i>Another rainy night,</i>

01:10.782 --> 01:12.852
<i>but who had time
to worry about the weather ?</i>

01:12.853 --> 01:14.722
<i>There was trouble in town.</i>

01:14.723 --> 01:17.394
<i>The city was under a reign
of mob terror.</i>

01:17.395 --> 01:18.931
<i>And my 3 partners and I</i>

01:18.932 --> 01:21.370
<i>were the only ones
who could stop it...</i>

01:24.377 --> 01:25.578
Because we were

01:25.579 --> 01:29.219
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

01:29.220 --> 01:30.723
Oh, that's it, Donatello.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.426
Tell every crank in town

01:32.427 --> 01:33.729
we're here, why don't ya ?

01:33.730 --> 01:35.199
I can't help it, Raphael.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.903
It's these trench coats.

01:36.904 --> 01:38.740
<i>We were hot on the case now.</i>

01:38.741 --> 01:41.011
<i>I felt my nerve ends tingling.</i>

01:41.012 --> 01:42.781
<i>A strange sixth sense told me</i>

01:42.782 --> 01:44.585
<i>we were nearing the scene 
of the crime.</i>

01:44.586 --> 01:46.757
<i>Somebody had broken the law.</i>

01:46.758 --> 01:50.598
<i>And somebody was gonna take a fall.</i>

01:50.599 --> 01:51.667
You wanna try being

01:51.668 --> 01:54.439
a little more discreet, Sam spudhead ?

01:54.440 --> 01:56.778
<i>in the thick of the crowd was 
April O'Neill,</i>

01:56.779 --> 01:58.280
<I>a tough cookie.

01:58.281 --> 02:00.686
<i>she was already on top of the story.</i>

02:00.687 --> 02:01.688
And you actually

02:01.689 --> 02:03.725
saw the burglary take place ?

02:03.726 --> 02:05.028
Oh, well, did I ever.

02:05.029 --> 02:07.566
They had all these
martian rays and things.

02:07.567 --> 02:08.735
They sliced open the store

02:08.737 --> 02:11.642
like it was a chocolate cream pie.

02:11.643 --> 02:14.147
I mean, what kind of crooks
use heat rays ?

02:14.148 --> 02:17.220
I think they were
from Venus or somethin'.

02:17.221 --> 02:20.561
<i>It was the same story
in banks all over town.</i>

02:20.562 --> 02:24.535
<I>The city was being
sucked dry by the mob.

02:25.472 --> 02:27.876
<i>They took anything ed down,</i>

02:27.877 --> 02:30.348
<i>and even a few that were.</i>

02:30.349 --> 02:32.286
<i>They were using gear
so advanced,</i>

02:32.287 --> 02:34.290
<i>it was straight out of star wars.</i>

02:34.291 --> 02:36.060
<i>We knew the mob couldn't 
get those</i>

02:36.061 --> 02:38.131
<i>state of the art weapons 
on their own.</i>

02:38.132 --> 02:40.001
<i>We smelled a rat,</i>

02:40.002 --> 02:42.407
<i>a rat named Shredder.</i>

02:43.978 --> 02:45.713
<i>But what mobster was gutsy 
enough</i>

02:45.714 --> 02:47.818
<i>to deal with a creep like Shredder ?</i>

02:47.819 --> 02:49.989
<i>who was this mystery man ?</i>

02:49.990 --> 02:52.161
Tony Vivaldi, that's who.

02:52.162 --> 02:53.229
<i>Who said that ?</i>

02:53.230 --> 02:54.966
I did. I said,

02:54.967 --> 02:56.837
The guy behind all these crimes

02:56.838 --> 02:58.574
is Tony Vivaldi.

02:58.575 --> 03:00.845
You mean, Tony
"the butcher" Vivaldi ?

03:00.846 --> 03:03.351
Exactly. The police
I.D. 's some of his men

03:03.352 --> 03:05.355
at the bank robbery this morning.

03:05.356 --> 03:08.361
So the butcher is in league with 
Shredder.

03:08.362 --> 03:09.864
Oh, I always knew

03:09.865 --> 03:12.370
something about the butcher 
wasn't Kosher.

03:12.371 --> 03:15.877
So, like, where do
we find this sleazoid ?

03:15.878 --> 03:17.514
I've heard his favorite hangout

03:17.515 --> 03:20.119
is a nightclub called "the meat rack."

03:20.120 --> 03:21.622
We'll check it out, April.

03:21.623 --> 03:25.096
Meanwhile, i've got a story
to file in 20 minutes.

03:25.097 --> 03:26.900
Look !

03:26.901 --> 03:28.236
What is it, April ?

03:28.237 --> 03:29.973
A lead to the gangster's hideout ?

03:29.974 --> 03:31.543
A vital clue that will establish

03:31.544 --> 03:33.313
a link between the butcher and 
Shredder ?

03:33.314 --> 03:36.253
A new kind of pizza
I haven't tried yet ?

03:36.254 --> 03:38.758
Even better !

03:38.759 --> 03:40.762
A little hamster statue.

03:40.763 --> 03:42.934
Isn't it the cutest thing ?

03:42.935 --> 03:44.303
Gimme a break.

03:44.304 --> 03:45.338
<I>oy vey.

03:45.339 --> 03:47.342
Gag me with a pizza ladle.

03:47.343 --> 03:49.381
I've always wanted one.

03:49.382 --> 03:52.287
It'll just take a sec.

03:52.288 --> 03:54.624
Welcome to shlavotny's
all-night antiques.

03:54.625 --> 03:55.627
Can I help you ?

03:55.628 --> 03:58.700
How much is that
hamster in the window ?

03:58.701 --> 04:00.036
Why do I have a feeling

04:00.037 --> 04:01.873
that song won't make the top 10 ?

04:01.874 --> 04:04.312
Wow ! Check it out !

04:04.313 --> 04:09.356
A genuine louis xiv
antique pizza-maker.

04:09.357 --> 04:12.496
A must-have item
for any turtle lair.

04:12.497 --> 04:14.500
Could you have it delivered ?

04:14.501 --> 04:16.003
But of course, little lady.

04:16.004 --> 04:17.172
Hey, Chester !

04:21.649 --> 04:23.719
Take this to 110 west 13TH,

04:23.720 --> 04:25.289
and make it snappy.

04:25.290 --> 04:27.026
Oh, sure, mr. Shlavotny.

04:28.864 --> 04:30.233
How much do I owe you ?

04:30.234 --> 04:32.538
For you, doll, a mere 10 spot.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.441
Oh, how about giving me

04:34.442 --> 04:36.547
the same deal on this gizmo ?

04:36.548 --> 04:37.649
No way.

04:37.650 --> 04:40.288
$12.65.
That's the price.

04:40.289 --> 04:42.058
Oh, but all I got

04:42.059 --> 04:46.467
in my turtle bank is $12.40.

04:46.468 --> 04:48.305
Tough noogies, frog-face.

04:48.306 --> 04:50.409
Now scram before your puss breaks

04:50.410 --> 04:52.580
some valuable antique mirrors.

04:52.581 --> 04:55.787
Sheesh, what a geek !

04:55.788 --> 04:58.726
I really wanted that pizza-maker.

05:00.497 --> 05:02.935
This is the place, butcher.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.839
Leave us to it.

05:04.840 --> 05:08.513
Yes, gentlemen,
how may i be of service ?

05:08.514 --> 05:10.986
I was wondering if
you'd be interested

05:10.987 --> 05:14.125
in this fine stradivarius ?

05:15.161 --> 05:17.866
I was hopin' to trade it
for a statue.

05:17.867 --> 05:20.705
A--a--a statue ?

05:20.706 --> 05:22.209
That's right,

05:22.210 --> 05:23.712
of a hamster.

05:23.713 --> 05:26.785
I--i--i had one,
but i--i just sold it.

05:26.786 --> 05:28.722
Don't yank my chain, pops.

05:28.723 --> 05:29.724
Where you hidin' it ?

05:29.725 --> 05:31.261
N-n-n-n-n-nowhere.

05:31.262 --> 05:33.132
It's gone. Honest.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.334
Ok...

05:34.335 --> 05:37.341
Lefty, leave us waste this place.

05:37.342 --> 05:39.779
With the utmost pleasure, boss.

05:45.291 --> 05:47.629
Catch you outside channel six.

05:47.630 --> 05:48.631
We'll be there.

05:48.632 --> 05:52.305
A quarter !

05:52.306 --> 05:54.142
That gives me just enough

05:54.143 --> 05:56.314
For that antique
Pizza-maker.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.251
Uh, wait here, dudes.

05:58.252 --> 05:59.287
Not my collection

05:59.288 --> 06:01.759
Of ancient egyptian
Pocket calculators !

06:01.760 --> 06:05.132
Hello, mister !

06:05.133 --> 06:08.139
Uh, what the heck's
Going on ?

06:08.140 --> 06:09.508
Hey, butcher,

06:09.509 --> 06:10.744
Ain't that one
Of them turtles

06:10.745 --> 06:12.180
We was supposed to nab ?

06:12.181 --> 06:14.084
It sure is.

06:19.330 --> 06:20.999
No fair !

06:21.000 --> 06:24.205
You turkeys won't
Get away with this.

06:24.206 --> 06:25.307
Snap it up.

06:25.308 --> 06:27.479
Those other turtles
Must be lurking nearby.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.416
We'll nab them, too.

06:29.417 --> 06:31.420
I'm worried
About michelangelo.

06:31.421 --> 06:32.891
So what else is new ?

06:32.892 --> 06:34.426
I've been worried
About him for years.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.865
Let's make sure
He's all right.

06:38.069 --> 06:39.571
What a mess.

06:39.572 --> 06:41.709
Yeah, looks like
Our bedroom.

06:41.710 --> 06:44.715
See ? This is
What you get

06:44.716 --> 06:46.619
For being crabby
With the customers.

06:48.224 --> 06:49.559
Michelangelo's hat !

06:49.560 --> 06:51.362
What happened
To our friend ?

06:51.363 --> 06:55.405
Answer me, or i'll use
My tough-guy voice.

06:55.406 --> 06:57.409
T-t-they--they--
They took him.

06:57.410 --> 06:58.578
Who took him ?

06:58.579 --> 07:01.250
The butcher. Unh.

07:01.251 --> 07:02.920
We've got to find him.

07:02.921 --> 07:04.757
But how ?

07:04.758 --> 07:06.695
Well, we could
Take out an ad

07:06.696 --> 07:07.697
In the newspaper,

07:07.698 --> 07:09.100
Asking if anyone's
Seen him,

07:09.101 --> 07:10.502
But offhand, i'd say

07:10.503 --> 07:11.772
We split up
And search.

07:11.773 --> 07:14.244
All right, but be careful.

07:16.350 --> 07:19.355
Oh, Michelangelo !

07:21.360 --> 07:23.329
What are you gawkin' at ?

07:23.330 --> 07:25.701
Haven't you ever seen
A turtle in a raincoat before ?

07:27.539 --> 07:30.044
I gotta learn to keep
My beak shut.

07:42.070 --> 07:45.042
I couldn't find
A trace of michelangelo.

07:45.043 --> 07:46.412
Me, neither.

07:46.413 --> 07:47.914
Where's raphael ?

07:47.915 --> 07:50.754
Oh, no. Don't tell me
He's missing, too.

07:50.755 --> 07:53.259
We can't afford to get
Trapped ourselves.

07:53.260 --> 07:55.431
We must seek
Master splinter's help.

08:01.444 --> 08:04.383
There's no sign of those
Other two turtles.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.487
Forget them.
Right now

08:06.488 --> 08:08.725
Let's just find
That hamster.

08:08.726 --> 08:11.732
If those criminals did take
Raphael and michelangelo

08:11.733 --> 08:13.334
It would certainly indicate

08:13.335 --> 08:15.071
That they're in league
With shredder.

08:15.072 --> 08:16.608
But why, master ?

08:16.609 --> 08:19.214
True, the butcher gets
To rob the city blind,

08:19.215 --> 08:20.917
But what's in it
For shredder ?

08:20.918 --> 08:22.420
What, indeed ?

08:22.421 --> 08:25.761
My ancient enemy does not
Share power easily.

08:25.762 --> 08:28.133
Wait, maybe it has to do
With that antique shop

08:28.134 --> 08:29.168
They tore apart.

08:29.169 --> 08:32.006
They were probably
Searching for something.

08:32.008 --> 08:34.279
Excellent reasoning,
Donatello.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.784
You may make
A good detective yet.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.421
<I>with my partners
<I>vanishing

08:38.422 --> 08:40.926
<I>like pepperonis
<I>in a pizza baking contest,

08:40.927 --> 08:43.597
<I>splinter, our head honcho,
<I>decided to join us.

08:43.599 --> 08:46.471
<I>we were looking for trouble
<I>in the antique district,

08:46.472 --> 08:49.110
<I>and it wasn't long
<I>before we found it.

08:50.881 --> 08:51.982
The butcher !

08:51.983 --> 08:53.920
The turtles !

08:53.921 --> 08:56.392
And the guy they
Take orders from.

08:56.393 --> 08:57.394
Get 'em, boys.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.548
We cannot fight
These weapons.

09:07.549 --> 09:08.918
Get to safety.

09:08.919 --> 09:10.856
I will draw their fire.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.837
Our master splinter.

09:19.709 --> 09:22.714
Yeah, you dirty rat,
It's curtains for you.

09:22.715 --> 09:25.119
Heh. All my life,
I've wanted to say that.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.894
You cannot h

09:28.895 --> 09:30.196
Save yourself.

09:30.197 --> 09:32.200
Run.
But <I>sensei--

09:32.201 --> 09:34.070
Run ! That is an order.

09:36.177 --> 09:37.812
This'll stop him.

09:40.185 --> 09:42.289
Chalk off
That turtle.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.925
He's finished.

09:53.513 --> 09:56.685
<I>what a feeling. It was like
<I>i'd eaten liverwurst pizzas

09:56.686 --> 09:58.021
<I>on an empty stomach.

09:58.022 --> 10:00.392
<I>splinter was gone.
<I>the other turtles were gone.

10:00.393 --> 10:03.533
<I>i was all alone,
<I>and i was hurting bad.

10:03.534 --> 10:06.138
<I>there was only one place
<I>i could go.

10:08.377 --> 10:10.982
But, april,
You've got to do it.

10:10.983 --> 10:13.821
You're the only one
Who crack this story

10:13.822 --> 10:15.825
On this bizarre
Crime wave.

10:15.826 --> 10:17.061
But why me ?

10:17.062 --> 10:20.067
Because only you have
The street smarts,

10:20.068 --> 10:22.573
The contacts,
The just plain guts,

10:22.574 --> 10:25.612
To uncover the truth
About this menace.

10:25.613 --> 10:26.648
Really ?

10:26.649 --> 10:29.020
Besides, there's
A very simple reason

10:29.021 --> 10:30.957
Why it has to be you.

10:30.958 --> 10:32.994
Which is ?

10:32.995 --> 10:34.731
Everyone else is
Just too darn scared.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.304
So what about
Tomorrow night,

10:37.305 --> 10:40.209
You great big
Hunk of man, you ?

10:40.210 --> 10:42.948
Oh, ok. How about
Next week ? Next year ?

10:44.019 --> 10:45.387
Excuse me.

10:45.388 --> 10:47.024
Sounds like somebody
Just passed out

10:47.025 --> 10:48.327
In front of my office.

10:49.396 --> 10:50.632
You ?

10:50.633 --> 10:53.838
Oh, uh,
Which one are you ?

10:53.839 --> 10:55.241
Donatello.

10:55.242 --> 10:58.448
Got to...find...april.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.951
Oh, i'll get her for you.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.955
You just stay put

11:01.956 --> 11:05.262
Before somebody makes
A news story out of you.

11:05.263 --> 11:07.266
So that's the story,
April.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.672
The butcher
Got everybody ?

11:09.673 --> 11:11.208
Even master splinter.

11:11.209 --> 11:13.213
We've gotta find them.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.217
Where could he have
Taken them ?

11:15.218 --> 11:18.724
Only one place
I can think of--

11:18.725 --> 11:20.293
The meat rack.

11:23.702 --> 11:25.705
I grabbed three
Of the turtles

11:25.706 --> 11:27.576
And knocked off
The fourth.

11:27.577 --> 11:30.214
And i got that
Giant rat also.

11:30.215 --> 11:32.586
You have done well,
Butcher,

11:32.587 --> 11:37.196
But you still have not gotten me
The maltese hamster.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.599
I have given you weapons

11:38.600 --> 11:41.338
Which have made you
Master of the city,

11:41.339 --> 11:45.613
Yet you are incapable of finding
A simple little statue.

11:45.614 --> 11:48.754
Leave us not
Blow our corks, shredder.

11:48.755 --> 11:52.295
My boys can't go through
Every antique store in town.

11:52.296 --> 11:54.299
They don't have to.

11:54.300 --> 11:57.104
One of the devices
I so generously gave you

11:57.105 --> 11:59.108
Is a superconducting
Magnet.

11:59.109 --> 12:01.112
Just set it to "antiques,"

12:01.113 --> 12:02.749
And it will
Electromagneticly empty out

12:02.750 --> 12:05.923
Every antique shop
Within a 50-mile radius

12:05.924 --> 12:09.129
And pull the antiques
Straight to your headquarters.

12:09.130 --> 12:11.835
Now quit gaping
And do it.

12:11.836 --> 12:14.876
Gee, what a handy
Little gadget.

12:14.877 --> 12:17.013
Hmm, let me see.

12:17.014 --> 12:18.148
Toys...

12:18.149 --> 12:19.619
Home furnishings...

12:19.620 --> 12:21.289
Men's underwear...

12:21.290 --> 12:24.428
"antiques."

12:31.645 --> 12:33.514
<I>we were headed
<I>for the butcher's hangout,

12:33.515 --> 12:34.817
<I>but i didn't have a clue.

12:34.818 --> 12:37.590
<I>what was he up to ?
<I>what was his plan ?

12:37.591 --> 12:40.329
<I>and then it struck me.

12:40.330 --> 12:42.333
It's raining
Knickknacks.

12:42.334 --> 12:45.339
This must be
The butcher's doing.

12:45.340 --> 12:47.544
Yeah. With shredder's help.

12:47.545 --> 12:50.150
All we have to do is
Follow these antiques,

12:50.151 --> 12:52.354
And they'll lead us
Straight to his hideout.

12:52.355 --> 12:55.226
Sweetheart,
You read my mind.

12:55.227 --> 12:57.699
<I>it was happening
<I>all over town.

12:57.700 --> 12:59.703
<I>the police were baffled.

12:59.704 --> 13:01.773
Just where do you
You're think goin' ?

13:01.774 --> 13:04.045
Uh, just out for a stroll,
Copper.

13:04.046 --> 13:05.514
Go home, you two.

13:05.515 --> 13:07.653
Finding the butcher
Is a job for us pros.

13:07.654 --> 13:11.260
All you flatfoots
Can find is a doughnut shop.

13:11.261 --> 13:12.363
Now, listen,
Gumshoe.

13:12.364 --> 13:13.598
Don't go stickin'
Your green nose

13:13.599 --> 13:15.102
In police business.

13:15.103 --> 13:16.739
Green nose ?

13:17.775 --> 13:19.544
Uh, n-nice outfit.

13:19.545 --> 13:21.815
May we go now,
Officer ?

13:21.816 --> 13:22.818
All right,
All right.

13:22.819 --> 13:24.621
But let me give you
A piece of advice:

13:24.622 --> 13:25.991
Stay off of my beat.

13:25.992 --> 13:27.027
Ok.

13:27.028 --> 13:28.363
And don't talk
To strangers.

13:28.364 --> 13:30.300
Sure, sure. Ok.

13:30.301 --> 13:32.138
And don't eat candy
Without a wrapper.

13:32.139 --> 13:34.008
All right, already !

13:34.009 --> 13:37.382
And look both ways
Before crossing the street.

13:37.383 --> 13:39.386
<I>we finally made it
<I>to the meat rack.

13:39.387 --> 13:41.657
<I>the place was a zoo.

13:41.658 --> 13:43.194
<I>well, more like
<I>a butcher shop.

13:43.195 --> 13:45.031
<I>anyway,
<I>it was crowded.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.902
Hey. Where you going,

13:46.903 --> 13:48.906
Short, green,
And handsome ?

13:48.907 --> 13:50.943
Excuse me, but
We're in a hurry.

13:50.944 --> 13:53.082
<I>we headed
<I>for the back of the club.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.019
<I>that's where the butcher
<I>would be.

13:55.020 --> 13:57.558
<I>and we had to find out
<I>what he was up to ?

13:59.095 --> 14:00.597
Oh, forget it, boss.

14:00.598 --> 14:02.936
There ain't
A single maltese hamster

14:02.937 --> 14:05.975
In this whole
Pile of junk.

14:05.976 --> 14:07.979
No luck,
Mr. Shredder.

14:07.980 --> 14:09.916
We've got every
Antique in town,

14:09.917 --> 14:12.222
And not a trace
Of that statue.

14:12.223 --> 14:13.792
What ? Impossible !

14:13.793 --> 14:16.998
You ignoramuses have
Slipped up somewhere.

14:16.999 --> 14:20.339
Hey ! Don't go blaming us,
Metal mouth.

14:20.340 --> 14:21.909
Now you listen to me.

14:21.910 --> 14:23.946
I'm going to be on the docks
At midnight,

14:23.947 --> 14:26.284
And you better be there
With the statue,

14:26.285 --> 14:28.222
Or else !

14:28.223 --> 14:29.591
You were right.

14:29.592 --> 14:31.963
Shredder <I>is behind
This whole thing.

14:31.964 --> 14:34.234
We've gotta find
Splinter and the others.

14:36.106 --> 14:38.710
I can't take you
Anywhere.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.716
Well, lookie
What we got here.

14:41.717 --> 14:43.554
Boys, grab 'em !

14:43.555 --> 14:46.193
<I>this was it.
<I>i knew it was curtains.

14:46.194 --> 14:47.529
<I>i knew
<I>we were finished,

14:47.530 --> 14:48.965
<I>but most of all,

14:48.966 --> 14:52.740
<I>i knew it was time
<I>for a break.

14:58.820 --> 15:00.122
Get 'em, boys !

15:00.123 --> 15:02.493
How are we gonna
Get out of this ?

15:02.494 --> 15:06.469
Simple, sweetheart.
We run for it !

15:22.536 --> 15:24.674
Hah ! Food fight !

15:27.547 --> 15:31.054
No fair. They're making
A bigger mess than we are.

15:32.291 --> 15:34.260
You'll pay for this.

15:34.261 --> 15:36.699
Come on. Let's
Get outta here.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.242
<I>we headed for
<I>april's place.

15:41.243 --> 15:43.446
<I>i was afraid
<I>the butcher's goons

15:43.447 --> 15:44.749
<I>might have already
<I>beaten us there,

15:44.750 --> 15:46.853
<I>so we took
<I>the side entrance.

15:46.854 --> 15:50.294
Oh, really !
This is ridiculous.

15:50.295 --> 15:51.831
Look, sweetheart,

15:51.832 --> 15:53.601
I don't want
The butcher's boys

15:53.602 --> 15:55.472
To have the drop on us.

15:55.473 --> 15:56.808
I could've just
Asked the super

15:56.809 --> 15:59.881
If anyone suspicious
Had come in, you know.

15:59.882 --> 16:01.785
Now, do you mind
Telling me

16:01.786 --> 16:03.889
What we're doing
In my apartment ?

16:03.890 --> 16:05.893
Whatever the butcher
Is looking for

16:05.894 --> 16:09.234
Has to be something major
'Cause shredder wants it.

16:09.235 --> 16:11.740
And if my hunch
Is correct, it's--

16:13.511 --> 16:15.581
The package.

16:15.582 --> 16:16.649
This is it--

16:16.650 --> 16:18.653
The thing they're
All looking for.

16:18.654 --> 16:20.491
My hamster statue ?

16:20.492 --> 16:22.996
That's right,
Sweetheart.

16:22.997 --> 16:24.833
Meet me at the docks
At midnight

16:24.834 --> 16:26.670
And bring it
With you.

16:26.671 --> 16:29.676
You're not gonna give this
To shredder, are you ?

16:29.677 --> 16:32.015
Of course not, but it's
My only bargaining chip

16:32.016 --> 16:34.687
To get splinter
And the others back.

16:34.688 --> 16:36.358
<I>i had to find out

16:36.359 --> 16:38.863
<I>just what made that statue
<I>so important.

16:38.864 --> 16:40.066
<I>and to do that,

16:40.067 --> 16:43.372
<I>i needed one simple
<I>piece of equipment.

16:43.373 --> 16:44.542
What do we do, boss ?

16:44.543 --> 16:45.610
It's nearly
Midnight,

16:45.611 --> 16:47.714
And we still don't
Got that statue.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.820
I don't know. But
That guy shredder's

16:49.821 --> 16:51.723
Gonna be real ticked off.

16:51.724 --> 16:54.228
<I>welcome to another
<I>edition of...

16:54.229 --> 16:57.235
Donatello ! <I>the show
<I>for couch potatoes

16:57.236 --> 17:00.074
<I>who don't know beans.

17:00.075 --> 17:01.578
It's the turtle
Again.

17:01.579 --> 17:04.584
He must've
Come back to life.

17:04.585 --> 17:07.156
I should've finished you off
When i had the chance.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.724
<I>then you'd never
<I>get the statue

17:08.726 --> 17:11.699
<I>everybody wants,
<I>but that i have.

17:11.700 --> 17:14.036
You got it ?!
Give it to me !

17:14.037 --> 17:15.540
<I>not so fast.

17:15.540 --> 17:18.780
<I>first you're gonna tell me
<I>why shredder wants it so bad.

17:18.781 --> 17:22.186
Ok. There was once
This evil scientist

17:22.188 --> 17:24.124
Who lived on
The island of malta.

17:24.125 --> 17:27.531
He was the greatest
Scientist in all of malta.

17:27.532 --> 17:31.106
He was also the only
Scientist in all of malta.

17:31.107 --> 17:33.478
One day, he invented
A formula

17:33.479 --> 17:35.115
For a new super fuel,

17:35.116 --> 17:38.121
More powerful
Than anything ever known.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.260
It was the same day
He passed away.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.097
But he'd written down
The formula

17:43.098 --> 17:46.638
Inside this statue
Of a cute little hamster.

17:46.639 --> 17:50.346
<I>so that's why shredder
<I>wants the maltese hamster.

17:50.347 --> 17:52.918
Right.
With that super fuel,

17:52.919 --> 17:54.855
He can repower
His technodrome

17:54.856 --> 17:56.894
And rule the world.

17:56.895 --> 17:58.864
And i get dibs
On detroit.

17:58.865 --> 18:02.037
Now where are you
Hiding that hamster ?

18:02.038 --> 18:04.209
<I>hold your horses.
<I>you'll get it.

18:04.210 --> 18:06.213
<I>just bring splinter
<I>and the other turtles

18:06.214 --> 18:09.253
<I>to the docks at midnight.
<I>we'll swap then.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.923
It's a deal.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.228
<I>and i don't want to see
<I>any weapons,

18:13.229 --> 18:15.266
<I>not even spitballs.

18:15.267 --> 18:17.938
What a spoilsport.

18:17.939 --> 18:19.240
Thanks, fellas.

18:19.241 --> 18:21.278
It's been a pleasure
Doing business with you.

18:21.279 --> 18:22.781
The turtle !

18:22.782 --> 18:24.184
He's really here !

18:24.185 --> 18:25.186
Get him !

18:30.264 --> 18:32.302
Just what i was
Looking for.

18:32.303 --> 18:34.239
See you at midnight.

18:38.783 --> 18:40.786
Hey, remember,
He said

18:40.787 --> 18:44.293
He didn't want
To <I>see any weapons.

18:44.294 --> 18:45.963
Quiet, you mugs.

18:45.964 --> 18:48.636
Shredder will
Be here any--

18:48.637 --> 18:50.707
You incompetent slugs.

18:50.708 --> 18:53.212
Can't you do
Anything right ?

18:53.213 --> 18:54.982
It was
His fault.

18:54.983 --> 18:59.057
Oh, my fault ?
You was steering.

18:59.058 --> 19:00.627
Oh, shut up,
Shut up, shut up,

19:00.628 --> 19:01.629
Both of you !

19:01.630 --> 19:04.302
Well, do you have
The maltese hamster ?

19:04.303 --> 19:05.804
Well, uh...

19:05.805 --> 19:07.776
No.
But, you see...

19:07.777 --> 19:10.515
What ?! Butcher,
I warned you.

19:10.516 --> 19:12.285
Uh, excuse me.

19:12.286 --> 19:14.123
Is this what
You're looking for ?

19:14.124 --> 19:16.127
The statue !
Give it to me !

19:16.128 --> 19:18.866
Not until you
Release my friends.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.870
The package first,

19:20.871 --> 19:23.976
Now ! Or else i'll
Finish them myself.

19:23.977 --> 19:27.918
Ok. I guess you
Hold all the cards.

19:29.321 --> 19:31.325
Oh, mine at last.

19:34.733 --> 19:36.569
It's the formula.

19:36.570 --> 19:39.709
The technodrome
Will roll again !

19:39.710 --> 19:42.348
All right, shredhead,
You got what you wanted.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.052
Now release the others.

19:44.053 --> 19:47.058
But the destruction
Of you and your friends

19:47.059 --> 19:50.933
Is also what i wanted.
Finish them !

19:54.241 --> 19:56.277
My formula !

19:56.278 --> 19:58.248
The turtles have
No such ray guns.

19:58.249 --> 19:59.918
You must have done it.

19:59.919 --> 20:01.622
Me ? No way.

20:01.623 --> 20:03.860
I'm innocent,
I tell ya.

20:03.861 --> 20:05.764
Hi, guys.
Did you miss me ?

20:05.765 --> 20:07.602
To the max, dude.

20:07.603 --> 20:10.508
Just for that,
I'm taking my weapons back.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.879
Bebop,
A teleportational ray.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.015
Right, boss.

20:17.857 --> 20:19.860
Hey ! What

20:19.861 --> 20:23.535
I teleported my weapons
Back to the technodrome.

20:23.536 --> 20:25.272
Hey, well,
What about us ?

20:25.273 --> 20:27.810
You cheap crooks
Are finished.

20:27.811 --> 20:29.381
Wrong, shredder.

20:29.382 --> 20:31.385
You're the one
Who's finished.

20:31.386 --> 20:33.389
The turtles are loose.

20:33.390 --> 20:35.894
And we don't have
Any weapons.

20:35.895 --> 20:37.397
To the technodrome.

20:37.398 --> 20:40.337
We shall meet again,
Turtles.

20:44.079 --> 20:48.253
When it comes to exit lines,
Nobody beats ol' shredder.

20:48.254 --> 20:50.258
He got away again.

20:50.259 --> 20:53.664
Perhaps, but his
Associates have not.

20:53.665 --> 20:56.938
Master splinter's right.
Let's do it !

20:56.939 --> 20:59.944
Now, boys,
Leave us be reasonable.

20:59.945 --> 21:01.948
We was just
Foolin'.

21:01.949 --> 21:04.387
Can't you
Take a joke ?

21:05.725 --> 21:07.728
In a word--no.

21:07.729 --> 21:11.736
Go green machine !

21:11.737 --> 21:13.439
<i>We made quick work
of the butcher and his mob</i>

21:13.440 --> 21:15.043
<i>and left them for the police.</i>

21:15.044 --> 21:18.617
<i>they were given a collective
sentence of 843 years</i>

21:18.618 --> 21:19.986
<i>for robbery, racketeering,</i>

21:19.987 --> 21:23.027
<i>and tearing those little
tags off of mattresses.</i>

21:23.028 --> 21:24.062
<i>as for Shredder,</i>

21:24.063 --> 21:25.866
<i>we knew we'd see him again.</i>

21:25.867 --> 21:28.405
<i>He's the bad penny
that keeps turning up,</i>

<i>the rotten apple
that spoils the bunch,</i>

21:31.010 --> 21:34.550
The moldy anchovy
that ruins the pizza.

21:34.551 --> 21:36.054
- Hey, Donatello ?
