{\an1}SOMEWHERE TO TALK

09:24.397 --> 09:25.765
{\an1}WHERE NO ONE WILL HEAR US.

12:12.731 --> 12:13.132
{\an1}TO BE A JERK,

12:13.199 --> 12:16.001
{\an1}BUT I'M A GUEST HERE, SO...

12:16.068 --> 12:16.669
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'RE GONNA BE A GUEST

12:16.735 --> 12:17.169
{\an1}WITH A BLACK EYE

12:17.236 --> 12:17.770
{\an1}IF YOU DON'T HELP ME.

12:17.837 --> 12:18.337
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT,

12:18.404 --> 12:19.138
{\an1}I'LL MAKE SOME SIGNS.

12:19.205 --> 12:22.241
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.043
{\an1}OH, OSCAR, GOOD YOU'RE HERE.

12:24.110 --> 12:25.244
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES, AND I'M SO HAPPY

12:25.311 --> 12:26.779
{\an1}TO BE OUT FROM BEHIND MY DESK.

12:26.846 --> 12:28.347
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S GREAT.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.215
{\an1}MR. LARUE QUIT,

12:29.281 --> 12:29.682
{\an1}SO CAN YOU SIT

12:29.748 --> 12:30.483
{\an1}BEHIND THE ARRIVAL DESK

12:30.549 --> 12:33.619
{\an1}AND CHECK PEOPLE IN?

12:33.686 --> 12:36.355
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SURE.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.123
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AND LULU, I'M GONNA NEED YOU

12:37.189 --> 12:37.623
{\an1}TO BE IN CHARGE

12:37.690 --> 12:39.692
{\an1}OF THE DOVE RELEASE.

12:39.758 --> 12:41.894
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE GOT TO BE JOKING.

12:41.961 --> 12:43.295
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DO I LOOK LIKE I'M JOKING?

12:43.362 --> 12:44.063
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DO I LOOK LIKE I'M GETTING

12:44.130 --> 12:45.598
{\an1}WITHIN 80 FEET OF A BIRD?

12:45.664 --> 12:46.565
{\an1}FORGET IT.

12:46.632 --> 12:47.566
{\an1}GET OSCAR TO DO IT.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.368
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SORRY, BUSY.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.436
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

12:50.503 --> 12:52.304
{\an1}BIONIC EARS?

12:52.371 --> 12:53.305
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SIGN'S DONE.

12:53.372 --> 12:53.706
{\an1}CAN I GET

12:53.772 --> 12:55.074
{\an1}SOME MINI CRAB CAKES NOW?

12:55.141 --> 12:55.674
{\an1}AND YOU BETTER SAY YES

12:55.741 --> 12:56.375
{\an1}'CAUSE I ALREADY ATE

12:56.442 --> 12:58.010
{\an1}A WHOLE TRAY.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.011
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SPEAKING OF CAKES,

12:59.078 --> 13:00.012
{\an1}CAN YOU PUT THE WEDDING CAKE

13:00.079 --> 13:00.546
{\an1}BY THE ENTRANCE

13:00.613 --> 13:02.314
{\an1}SO PEOPLE CAN SEE IT?

13:02.381 --> 13:04.783
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THE WEDDING CAKE?

13:04.850 --> 13:05.351
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU DID REMEMBER

13:05.417 --> 13:07.019
{\an1}THE WEDDING CAKE, RIGHT?

13:07.086 --> 13:15.494
{\an1}&gt;&gt; UHH...

13:15.561 --> 13:16.262
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HIBBERT, WHAT DID I TELL YOU

13:16.328 --> 13:17.630
{\an1}ABOUT EATING THIS CAKE?

13:17.696 --> 13:18.130
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T.

13:18.197 --> 13:19.064
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THIS HAPPENS TO BE MORE

13:19.131 --> 13:20.132
{\an1}THAN JUST A DELICIOUS MOUND

13:20.199 --> 13:20.833
{\an1}OF CAKEY GOODNESS,

13:20.900 --> 13:22.334
{\an1}IT'S A SYMBOL OF MR. MADIGAN'S

13:22.401 --> 13:25.671
{\an1}UNFLINCHING LOVE.

13:25.738 --> 13:30.209
{\an1}OKAY, ONE LITTLE TASTE.

13:30.276 --> 13:30.776
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU KNOCKED OVER

13:30.843 --> 13:31.577
{\an1}THE WEDDING CAKE.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.711
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, I DIDN'T.

13:32.778 --> 13:33.679
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I SAW YOU.

13:33.746 --> 13:34.346
{\an1}I WAS STANDING PRETTY MUCH

13:34.413 --> 13:35.214
{\an1}WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW,

13:35.281 --> 13:37.016
{\an1}LOOKING DIRECTLY AT THE CAKE.

13:37.082 --> 13:39.185
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FINE, BUT I CAN FIX IT.

13:39.251 --> 13:39.718
{\an1}ALL I NEED

13:39.785 --> 13:41.153
{\an1}IS A BOX OF WEDDING CAKE MIX,

13:41.220 --> 13:44.823
{\an1}80 EGGS AND A CRAZY BIG BOWL.

13:44.890 --> 13:45.558
{\an1}OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

13:45.624 --> 13:46.158
{\an1}I CAN'T MAKE A CAKE

13:46.225 --> 13:46.926
{\an1}THAT TASTES AS AWESOME

13:46.992 --> 13:47.960
{\an1}AS THAT ONE PROBABLY DID.

13:48.027 --> 13:48.394
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY,

13:48.460 --> 13:49.895
{\an1}IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TASTE GOOD.

13:49.962 --> 13:52.698
{\an1}NO ONE REALLY EATS WEDDING CAKE.

13:52.765 --> 13:53.566
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THEY DON'T?

13:53.632 --> 13:54.099
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, IT'S MOSTLY

13:54.166 --> 14:05.277
{\an1}JUST FOR SHOW.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.279
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AMANDA CANTWELL.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.615
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.049
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE

14:10.115 --> 14:10.916
{\an1}I'M AT THE HEAD TABLE,

14:10.983 --> 14:13.018
{\an1}WITH THE BRIDE AND GROOM.

14:13.085 --> 14:14.787
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, THEY HAVE YOU AT TABLE 48

14:14.853 --> 14:17.423
{\an1}WITH UNCLE LOUIS THE ARSONIST.

14:17.489 --> 14:17.923
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AND IS THERE

14:17.990 --> 14:20.192
{\an1}A MRS. UNCLE LOUIS THE ARSONIST?

14:20.259 --> 14:22.027
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

14:22.094 --> 14:22.695
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, JUST TO BE SAFE,

14:22.761 --> 14:23.262
{\an1}I THINK I'M GONNA GO

14:23.329 --> 14:25.397
{\an1}POWDER UP A BIT.

14:25.464 --> 14:25.764
{\an1}OH, OH,

14:25.831 --> 14:27.299
{\an1}WHERE'S THE LADIES' ROOM?

14:27.366 --> 14:27.866
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RYAN WAS SUPPOSED

14:27.933 --> 14:29.468
{\an1}TO PUT UP SIGNS.

14:29.535 --> 14:39.311
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH YES, I SEE ONE NOW.

14:39.378 --> 14:39.878
{\an1}THIS DOES NOT APPEAR

14:39.945 --> 14:43.415
{\an1}TO BE THE LADIES' ROOM AT ALL.

14:43.482 --> 14:45.384
{\an1}OKAY.

14:45.451 --> 14:50.589
{\an1}OH.

14:50.656 --> 14:55.527
{\an1}OH, HELLO, BEAR.

14:55.594 --> 14:58.230
{\an1}I'LL JUST BE BACK HERE.

14:58.297 --> 14:58.664
{\an1}&gt;&gt; REMEMBER,

14:58.731 --> 14:59.665
{\an1}WE CANNOT TELL MS. AIDEM

14:59.732 --> 15:00.866
{\an1}THAT HER WEDDING PLANNER QUIT.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.835
{\an1}SHE'S ALREADY TOTALLY ON EDGE.

15:02.901 --> 15:03.836
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHY.

15:03.902 --> 15:09.808
{\an1}IT'S REALLY LOVELY HERE.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.076
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHERE'S RYAN WITH THAT CAKE?

15:11.143 --> 15:13.479
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HELP.

15:13.545 --> 15:14.146
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:14.213 --> 15:15.948
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S ABOUT THE RIGHT SIZE.

15:16.015 --> 15:16.649
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOW WHAT CAN I PUT ON IT

15:16.715 --> 15:17.916
{\an1}THAT LOOKS LIKE FROSTING?

15:17.983 --> 15:18.651
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THERE'S A TON OF WHITE GLUE

15:18.717 --> 15:20.886
{\an1}IN THE SUPPLY ROOM.

15:20.953 --> 15:21.320
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HIBBERT,

15:21.387 --> 15:22.721
{\an1}YOU'RE A REAL IDEA MAN.

15:22.788 --> 15:23.455
{\an1}I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYONE SAYS

15:23.522 --> 15:26.158
{\an1}YOU'LL NEVER GO ANYWHERE.

15:26.225 --> 15:30.596
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THEY SAY THAT?

15:30.663 --> 15:31.030
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, LULU,

15:31.096 --> 15:33.899
{\an1}DON'T LET THE DOOR...CLOSE.

15:33.966 --> 15:36.068
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH NO, THIS IS BAD.

15:36.135 --> 15:37.870
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I KNOW. WE'RE TRAPPED.

15:37.936 --> 15:38.804
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, I MEANT I REALLY

15:38.871 --> 15:40.906
{\an1}HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

15:40.973 --> 15:41.440
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, GO AHEAD.

15:41.507 --> 15:42.841
{\an1}THE BEAR DOESN'T SEEM TO MIND.

15:42.908 --> 15:44.009
{\an1}I'VE SEEN HIM GO 10 TIMES

15:44.076 --> 15:46.111
{\an1}SINCE I'VE BEEN IN HERE.

15:46.178 --> 15:48.147
{\an1}[BEAR GROWLS]

15:48.213 --> 15:55.988
{\an1}ELEVEN.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.956
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT DOESN'T LOOK SO BAD.

15:58.023 --> 16:03.862
{\an1}YEAH.

16:03.929 --> 16:08.600
{\an1}UH-OH.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.436
{\an1}NOBODY TAKE ANY.

16:10.502 --> 16:13.105
{\an1}IT'S ALL WOOD AND GLUE.

16:13.172 --> 16:23.582
{\an1}COULD YOU PRESS LOBBY, PLEASE?

16:23.649 --> 16:24.283
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THIS IS WAY HARDER

16:24.350 --> 16:26.285
{\an1}THAN I THOUGHT IT'D BE.

16:26.352 --> 16:28.253
{\an1}I'M EXHAUSTED.

16:28.320 --> 16:28.787
{\an1}MAYBE I SHOULD GO

16:28.854 --> 16:29.822
{\an1}SPLASH SOME WATER ON MY FACE.

16:29.888 --> 16:30.389
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THE LADIES' ROOM

16:30.456 --> 16:37.930
{\an1}IS OVER THERE.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.531
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THIS ISN'T THE LADIES' ROOM.

16:39.598 --> 16:40.165
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT GAVE IT AWAY?

16:40.232 --> 16:41.600
{\an1}THE SMALL PILE OF HUMAN BONES

16:41.667 --> 16:43.435
{\an1}IN THE CORNER?

16:43.502 --> 16:45.437
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AMANDA? LULU?

16:45.504 --> 16:48.741
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HI. WE'RE TRAPPED.

16:48.807 --> 16:52.311
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TRAPPED.

16:52.378 --> 16:54.513
{\an1}OKAY, OKAY, THIS IS BAD,

16:54.580 --> 16:57.850
{\an1}BUT IT'S NOT TERRIBLE.

16:57.916 --> 16:59.785
{\an1}NOW IT'S TERRIBLE.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.286
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, OSCAR.

17:01.353 --> 17:01.720
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH GOOD,

17:01.787 --> 17:02.688
{\an1}YOU'RE HERE WITH THE CAKE.

17:02.755 --> 17:03.322
{\an1}TRUE WANTS YOU TO PUT IT

17:03.389 --> 17:05.057
{\an1}ON THE TABLE OVER THERE.

17:05.124 --> 17:05.790
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, MAYBE I'LL JUST HOLD

17:05.858 --> 17:06.258
{\an1}THE CAKE,

17:06.325 --> 17:07.059
{\an1}SO EVERYONE CAN GET

17:07.126 --> 17:08.227
{\an1}A BETTER LOOK AT IT.

17:08.292 --> 17:10.561
{\an1}IT'S CLASSY.

17:10.628 --> 17:13.665
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MATTHIEU?

17:13.732 --> 17:14.199
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MR. LARUE TOOK

17:14.266 --> 17:15.300
{\an1}A LITTLE BREAK.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.300
{\an1}&gt;&gt; A BREAK?

17:16.367 --> 17:16.835
{\an1}I'VE BEEN WAITING

17:16.902 --> 17:17.836
{\an1}BEHIND THE TURKEY COMPOUND

17:17.903 --> 17:18.904
{\an1}FOR OVER AN HOUR.

17:18.971 --> 17:19.471
{\an1}AND WHY ARE YOU

17:19.538 --> 17:22.174
{\an1}HOLDING THE CAKE?

17:22.241 --> 17:25.877
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S CLASSY.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.579
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO TRUE?

17:27.646 --> 17:28.547
{\an1}SHE'S IN THE LADIES' ROOM.

17:28.614 --> 17:35.854
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, OKAY.

17:35.921 --> 17:36.588
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT IS THAT?

17:36.655 --> 17:37.756
{\an1}IS THAT AN ANIMAL?

17:37.823 --> 17:46.598
{\an1}IS THERE AN ANIMAL ON ME?

17:46.665 --> 17:47.933
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DORIS, CALM DOWN.

17:48.000 --> 17:48.967
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU CALM DOWN.

17:49.034 --> 17:51.336
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TRUE, WHERE'S MATTHIEU?

17:51.403 --> 17:54.473
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH YEAH, ABOUT THAT.

17:54.540 --> 17:55.841
{\an1}HE QUIT.

17:55.908 --> 17:56.675
{\an1}&gt;&gt; QUIT?

17:56.742 --> 17:59.178
{\an1}THIS WEDDING IS A DISASTER.

17:59.244 --> 17:59.912
{\an1}ALL I WANTED

17:59.978 --> 18:01.113
{\an1}WAS THE PERFECT DAY,

18:01.180 --> 18:02.281
{\an1}BUT ALL I GOT WAS--

18:02.347 --> 18:03.449
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S IT.

18:03.515 --> 18:11.089
{\an1}DORIS, COME WITH ME!

18:11.156 --> 18:12.257
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MY DRESS IS RUINED.

18:12.324 --> 18:13.325
{\an1}EVERYTHING'S RUINED.

18:13.392 --> 18:13.792
{\an1}&gt;&gt; STOP IT.

18:13.859 --> 18:14.893
{\an1}NOTHING'S RUINED.

18:14.960 --> 18:15.828
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BUT MY DRESS--

18:15.894 --> 18:16.261
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT

18:16.328 --> 18:18.430
{\an1}ABOUT THE DRESS, DORIS.

18:18.497 --> 18:20.299
{\an1}LIFE ISN'T ABOUT WHAT YOU WEAR.

18:20.365 --> 18:21.834
{\an1}OR CAKES OR PARTIES

18:21.900 --> 18:24.937
{\an1}OR WHO SITS NEXT TO WHOM.

18:25.003 --> 18:26.672
{\an1}LIFE IS ABOUT TWO PEOPLE

18:26.738 --> 18:28.607
{\an1}WHO LOOK ACROSS A CROWDED ROOM

18:28.674 --> 18:30.943
{\an1}AND ONLY SEE EACH OTHER.

18:31.009 --> 18:32.911
{\an1}THAT'S WHAT TODAY IS ABOUT,

18:32.978 --> 18:35.080
{\an1}AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

18:35.147 --> 18:36.315
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WOW.

18:36.381 --> 18:39.017
{\an1}I FEEL SO SAFE WITH YOU, MAX.

18:39.084 --> 18:40.953
{\an1}LET ME SEE YOUR FACE,

18:41.019 --> 18:53.332
{\an1}YOUR STRONG, FEARLESS FACE.

18:53.398 --> 18:54.032
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO GO

18:54.099 --> 18:55.067
{\an1}IN THE SNAKE HOUSE.

18:55.133 --> 18:55.601
{\an1}THEY'LL CHASE YOU

18:55.667 --> 18:56.735
{\an1}ALL AROUND THE ZOO FOR THAT,

18:56.802 --> 18:57.936
{\an1}SO...

18:58.003 --> 18:58.937
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LASERBEAM.

18:59.004 --> 19:00.873
{\an1}I WASN'T AWARE OF THAT.

19:00.939 --> 19:02.541
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SO, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

19:02.608 --> 19:06.745
{\an1}IS THE WEDDING OFF?

19:06.812 --> 19:08.881
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT SURE LOOKS THAT WAY.

19:08.947 --> 19:10.082
{\an1}&gt;&gt; COME ON,

19:10.148 --> 19:11.817
{\an1}WE CAN STILL HAVE THE WEDDING.
