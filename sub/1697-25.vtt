WEBVTT

00:03.980 --> 00:06.620
l still can't believe Hannah's
getting her own diamond

00:06.620 --> 00:09.580
on the Hollywood Parade of Diamonds.

00:10.180 --> 00:11.610
Come on, Oliver.

00:11.660 --> 00:14.930
l know it's a big honour,
but let's not act like tourists.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.329
Just be cool.

00:17.140 --> 00:18.810
Oh, my gosh, it's Madonna!

00:18.860 --> 00:19.970
-Take our picture.
-Take our picture.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.090
-Take our picture.
-Take our picture.

00:21.140 --> 00:23.250
Yeah. That's really cool.

00:25.820 --> 00:27.620
What is it with chicks and Madonna?

00:27.660 --> 00:29.090
l love you.

00:31.140 --> 00:33.250
So, where's your diamond gonna be?

00:33.300 --> 00:36.970
Well, the Hollywood Diamond
Committee said it's two past Madonna.

00:37.020 --> 00:39.660
So, Madonna, Brad Pitt...

00:43.540 --> 00:46.210
What's that gunk on your diamond?

00:46.260 --> 00:48.290
lt looks like chilli.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.140
lt is chilli.

00:52.020 --> 00:55.570
And it's gross.
Come on, people, keep it in your buns.

00:57.860 --> 00:58.930
Excuse me.

01:00.860 --> 01:02.530
Could you move your cart
down the street a little?

01:02.580 --> 01:05.410
Could l? Sure. Will l? No.

01:05.459 --> 01:09.090
But you could put it right
by Scooby-Doo's diamond.

01:09.140 --> 01:12.970
''Hot dog on a hot dog.''
l'll help you push.

01:13.020 --> 01:14.450
Hands off the cart, princess.

01:15.140 --> 01:17.370
l've been slinging weenies
on this spot for 20 years,

01:17.420 --> 01:19.220
and l'll be slinging them for 20 more.

01:19.260 --> 01:21.690
But Hannah Montana's diamond
is gonna be here,

01:21.740 --> 01:24.090
and your dogs are leaking on it.

01:24.140 --> 01:29.010
Hannah Montana?
All the kids in my building love her.

01:29.060 --> 01:32.180
-So you'll move?
-No. l hate all the kids in my building.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.460
Give it up, cupcake.

01:34.500 --> 01:38.380
There's nothing in the world
that's going to get me off of this spot.

01:39.580 --> 01:41.170
Quitting time.

01:41.540 --> 01:44.450
Don't worry, folks.
l'll be back tomorrow.

01:48.460 --> 01:49.780
My bad.

01:51.980 --> 01:54.940
l am not cleaning that up, mister.

01:56.060 --> 01:59.050
-Oliver, clean it up.
-No.

02:00.060 --> 02:01.250
Hey, look, flowers.

02:01.300 --> 02:04.370
At night, devoted fans
can place rose petals on your diamond

02:04.420 --> 02:06.770
to cover up the chilli stink.

02:06.820 --> 02:09.169
Still disgusting, but better.

02:11.940 --> 02:16.060
-Are you all right?
-Fine. The flowers make me phlegmy.

02:23.580 --> 02:25.250
Right on the diamond.

02:25.300 --> 02:28.420
Let me guess. You've been here
20 years and you'll be here 20 more?

02:28.460 --> 02:31.180
And after that, my son'll take over.

02:34.620 --> 02:37.210
Wow, talk about your spitting image.

02:43.660 --> 02:45.250
<i>come on</i>!

02:45.300 --> 02:47.810
<i>You get the limo out fron</i> t

02:49.260 --> 02:52.650
<i>Hottest styles, every sho</i> e

02:52.980 --> 02:56.330

03:10.420 --> 03:14.380
<i>You get the best of both world</i> s

03:14.540 --> 03:16.420

03:24.220 --> 03:27.570
<i>And you know tha</i> t
<i>it's the best of both world</i> s

03:30.900 --> 03:32.090
lt was disgusting.

03:32.140 --> 03:33.860
There was so much gunk
on the sidewalk,

03:33.900 --> 03:37.410
it was like l was getting my diamond
on Uncle Earl's back porch.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.290
Come on, darling. l'm eating here.

03:40.340 --> 03:43.140
Besides, it's not important
where they put the diamond,

03:43.180 --> 03:45.370
it's the fact they gave you one
in the first place.

03:45.420 --> 03:48.170
But the place they gave me
is on the corner of Chilli Avenue

03:48.220 --> 03:50.330
and Snot Rocket Boulevard.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.330
Now let me tell you,
when they gave me

03:52.380 --> 03:53.940
my diamond, what they did was...

03:53.980 --> 03:57.450
Put it right in front of
the world famous Chinese Theatre,

03:57.500 --> 03:59.690
right where the tour bus lets off.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.490
They say it's one of the most

04:01.540 --> 04:03.850
photographed diamonds
out there, but...

04:04.700 --> 04:07.290
l may not be the best example.

04:07.340 --> 04:08.610
You think?

04:08.660 --> 04:11.700
Let me tell you, honey,
what's important, is always remember,

04:11.740 --> 04:13.970
it's just an honour to have one.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.850
All right, great.
Then you'll give me yours.

04:17.380 --> 04:19.730
Honey, that wouldn't be right.

04:19.779 --> 04:22.500
Then you would have a great spot
and learn nothing.

04:22.540 --> 04:26.250
What kind of a father would l be
if l let that happen?

04:26.300 --> 04:28.530
The kind that just wants
to keep his spot.

04:28.580 --> 04:30.250
Honey, l had it first.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.610
Besides that,
it's right next to John Wayne.

04:32.660 --> 04:35.700
The Duke, honey, the Duke.

04:35.740 --> 04:37.690
But you said location doesn't matter.

04:37.740 --> 04:41.530
lt doesn't.
l'm just too old to listen to myself.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.890
You, on the other hand,
legally have to. Bye-bye.

04:52.220 --> 04:53.370
No.

04:58.700 --> 05:02.740
Please just be a little broken.
Please just be a little broken.

05:07.420 --> 05:09.570
l said please!

05:13.460 --> 05:16.210
And l was gonna get you a hot wax!

05:22.820 --> 05:25.250
Hey-o, it's Rico!

05:25.580 --> 05:28.250
Rico, my car broke down.
l'm going to be late for work.

05:28.780 --> 05:31.450
Sure, these things happen.
l totally understand.

05:31.740 --> 05:33.060
Well, gee, thanks, man.

05:33.260 --> 05:36.850
Of course, if you're not here
in five minutes, you're fired.

05:37.060 --> 05:39.250
Come on. Have a heart.

05:39.540 --> 05:43.130
4:58, 4:57... Tick-tock, tick-tock.

05:43.340 --> 05:45.980
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What if
l get somebody to cover my shift?

05:46.340 --> 05:49.610
ls it somebody like you
or someone with a brain?

05:50.980 --> 05:54.940
That's a good one, boss.
Hey, wanna hear another good one?

05:59.260 --> 06:01.610
...3, 2...

06:01.660 --> 06:03.060
Hey, boss.

06:04.940 --> 06:07.370
What do you want me to do first?

06:08.820 --> 06:10.540
A jumbo Jackson.

06:12.420 --> 06:14.610
This is gonna be good.

06:20.660 --> 06:21.730
Excuse me.

06:21.780 --> 06:25.610
l am looking for a Mr Randall Garrison,

06:25.660 --> 06:27.650
the President
of the Parade of Diamonds Committee.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.260
You found him.

06:29.980 --> 06:33.180
-What?
-l don't know! You screamed first!

06:33.220 --> 06:37.100
l'm just so thrilled
to finally meet Hannah Montana.

06:37.140 --> 06:41.290
What can l do for you?
Whatever it is, the answer is yes.

06:41.340 --> 06:44.300
-Great. Move my diamond.
-No.

06:45.140 --> 06:47.970
-But you said the answer is yes.
-l lied.

06:48.620 --> 06:51.180
But, Mr Garrison,
you don't understand.

06:51.220 --> 06:53.410
There's this hot dog guy
with drippy chilli

06:53.460 --> 06:58.050
and this phlegmy flower family
going...all over my diamond,

06:58.100 --> 07:00.290
and now all over your shoe.

07:01.300 --> 07:02.570
Sorry?

07:02.980 --> 07:06.450
So am l. Look, rules are rules.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.300
Only once in our history
have we ever moved a diamond.

07:09.340 --> 07:10.530
-Whose diamond?
-Your diamond.

07:10.580 --> 07:11.850
My diamond?

07:11.900 --> 07:14.090
Originally, you were
in a wonderful spot,

07:14.140 --> 07:15.650
then l switched it.

07:15.700 --> 07:20.490
Special request from a great talent
and an even greater humanitarian.

07:20.540 --> 07:24.660
That's right.
l'm talking about Pancake Buffalo.

07:26.380 --> 07:28.130
A puppet?

07:28.180 --> 07:31.730
l lost my diamond to a pile of purple felt

07:31.780 --> 07:33.770
with a hand
where its heinie should be?

07:35.420 --> 07:37.610
Hold it right there.

07:37.660 --> 07:41.410
When l was a little boy,
and Tv was my only friend,

07:41.460 --> 07:44.610
that pile of purple felt
taught me how to love.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.900
v ery, very touching. Switch me back.

07:48.940 --> 07:53.770
And put my little buffalo back under
that horrible pile of chilli and lung lava?

07:53.820 --> 07:56.050
l don't think so.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.210
Fine.

07:57.260 --> 08:00.570
lf you won't do the right thing,
then l'll just go talk to the hand.

08:00.620 --> 08:01.650
What hand?

08:01.700 --> 08:04.850
The hand that's up to its elbow
in buffalo butt.

08:09.900 --> 08:13.490
Here you go. Enjoy.
Y'all come back now, you hear?

08:15.820 --> 08:17.460
Excuse me, Mr Stewart.

08:17.500 --> 08:20.730
Anyone ever told you
you've got great hair?

08:21.620 --> 08:24.850
Rico, is the sky blue?

08:26.540 --> 08:29.420
l wouldn't know.
l'm not looking at the sky.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.730
l'm looking at hairy nachos!

08:36.659 --> 08:39.620
A friend of yours, l presume?

08:40.980 --> 08:42.650
l guess l could wear a hat.

08:42.700 --> 08:45.610
Thanks, but l've got a better idea.

08:51.420 --> 08:52.740
There.

08:54.860 --> 08:57.290
This is a crime against nature.

08:58.740 --> 09:02.780
Fine. You can lose the hair net,
but Jackson will lose his job.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.090
You are an evil little boy.

09:07.140 --> 09:09.450
Flattery will get you nowhere.

09:10.340 --> 09:14.730
Now l believe it's time to scrape
the gum from underneath the counter.

09:18.060 --> 09:21.260
This may take some time.
l chew a lot of gum.

09:22.820 --> 09:26.450
Hey, cafeteria lady,
less looky, more scrapey.

09:28.780 --> 09:33.090
You are about to find yourself
in a very sticky situation.

09:35.380 --> 09:37.890
Hey, Rico, l got my car started.

09:38.540 --> 09:39.770
Rico?

09:45.100 --> 09:47.130
-My dad?
-Yeah.

09:48.420 --> 09:51.060
-l'm fired?
-Yeah.

09:57.540 --> 10:00.770
<i>And that's all the planet</i> s

10:12.660 --> 10:13.770
Bye-bye, kids.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.980
That was a wonderful rehearsal.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.650
Hector, you deserve
an extra-special cupcake.

10:24.780 --> 10:27.500
Eight years of drama school for this.

10:28.780 --> 10:31.530
l can't believe
l'm this close to Pancake Buffalo.

10:31.580 --> 10:34.410
That little puppet taught me
how to go potty.

10:34.460 --> 10:37.610
<i>Diapers are for babie</i> s

10:37.660 --> 10:40.860

l get it! l get it.
You got the ''potty'' in you.

10:49.460 --> 10:50.890
Excuse me,

10:50.940 --> 10:54.530
Miss Pancake Buffalo
puppet-person lady.

10:54.980 --> 10:57.410
Hi, l'm Cindy Merriwether,

10:57.460 --> 11:00.340
and l know who you are,
Hannah Montana.

11:01.220 --> 11:04.930
But l don't know who you are,
or you, either.

11:04.980 --> 11:07.860
But that's okay, because...

11:07.900 --> 11:09.730
<i>When you don't kno</i> w
<i>someone's name..</i>.

11:09.780 --> 11:11.210
lt's Mike and Lola!

11:13.340 --> 11:17.380
Anyway, l hear that Pancake and l
are gonna be neighbours

11:17.420 --> 11:18.450
on the Parade of Diamonds.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.650
And Pancake is so excited.

11:21.820 --> 11:25.090
Miss Merriwether?
l'm not a kid any more.

11:25.140 --> 11:28.210
You don't have to
pretend like Pancake's real.

11:28.260 --> 11:29.980
What do you mean?

11:30.900 --> 11:34.020
-That he's a puppet.
-Oh, no, he's not.

11:35.100 --> 11:38.730
Yes, he is.
You operate him behind this thing.

11:38.780 --> 11:40.370
No, l don't.

11:41.860 --> 11:44.450
Pancake is my special friend.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.700
At my high school reunion,
he was my date.

11:50.420 --> 11:53.090
lt's nap time, Pancake.

11:56.660 --> 11:58.810
She's just deep into character.

11:58.860 --> 12:00.610
Yeah, scary deep.

12:02.020 --> 12:04.820
Bindenboudenschlasser truffles,

12:04.860 --> 12:08.290
made with milk
from happy Swiss cows.

12:08.340 --> 12:11.770
-Now what can l do for you?
-Well, you see...

12:13.060 --> 12:15.370
Well, you know that you've kind of...

12:16.140 --> 12:17.700
Well, you and...

12:19.220 --> 12:20.890
You stole my diamond!

12:20.940 --> 12:23.900
Now, you don't need to use
your angry voice.

12:23.940 --> 12:26.500
You know, she's always had a problem
with that.

12:26.540 --> 12:28.290
-Zip it!
-You see?

12:29.140 --> 12:30.970
Hannah, darling.

12:31.020 --> 12:34.610
Cindy understands why
you're such a grumpy-umpus.

12:36.140 --> 12:37.970
You had the diamond first,

12:38.020 --> 12:41.220
and we shouldn't have switched it
without asking.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.980
So you'll switch me back?

12:43.340 --> 12:46.170
-l would love to.
-Yes!

12:46.660 --> 12:48.650
But it's not up to me.

12:49.580 --> 12:52.460
l don't like where this is going.

12:52.500 --> 12:57.330
lt's up to me, blondie,
so ask me with your happy voice.

12:57.380 --> 12:58.530
Cindy, please.

12:58.580 --> 13:02.730
There's no Cindy down here!
Now let me hear that happy voice.

13:02.780 --> 13:04.050
Okay.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.220
Pancake Buffalo.

13:11.940 --> 13:14.330
Will you please
give me my diamond back?

13:15.420 --> 13:18.170
Well, now that you put it that way...

13:18.740 --> 13:19.890
No!

13:20.660 --> 13:21.850
But that's not fair!

13:21.900 --> 13:25.610
You want to switch diamonds?
Go ask that Garrison bozo.

13:25.660 --> 13:29.940
Wait a minute, he loves me.

13:30.900 --> 13:34.170
Okay, listen here,
you glorified oven mitt.

13:34.220 --> 13:37.370
Hey, Hannah, want to know
the weather report for Montana?

13:37.420 --> 13:42.130
Chilli all day,
with 1 00% chance of spit showers!

13:45.580 --> 13:47.490
Security! Security!

13:50.020 --> 13:52.250
Don't validate her parking.

13:58.060 --> 13:59.810
Excuse me, Mr Garrison.

14:00.380 --> 14:02.810
Miss Montana. Again.

14:02.860 --> 14:05.010
And if it's about your diamond,
l don't want to hear it.

14:05.060 --> 14:06.780
But, Mr Garrison,
you don't understand.

14:06.820 --> 14:08.300
l went to Cindy Merriwether

14:08.340 --> 14:11.010
and she made me talk to the puppet
like it was real.

14:11.060 --> 14:14.180
He is real to millions of children.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.380
So, what did he say?

14:18.500 --> 14:21.010
Your fuzzy little friend
called you a bozo.

14:21.460 --> 14:22.530
Miss Montana...

14:22.580 --> 14:24.890
-But it's true.
-We were there.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.650
lf you'll excuse me.

14:29.340 --> 14:30.570
Okay, that's it.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.530
lf Captain Kiss-Up is not gonna believe

14:32.580 --> 14:35.890
that Merriwether and her puppet
are evil,

14:35.940 --> 14:37.770
we will just have to show him.

14:37.820 --> 14:39.380
And how do we do that?

14:39.420 --> 14:43.930
Well, it usually involves bad accents,
sticky food and dumb costumes.

14:43.980 --> 14:45.780
That is so not true.

14:45.820 --> 14:49.090
Hey, Oliver, can you get your hands
on your mom's old security outfit?

14:49.140 --> 14:52.050
-l'm so in.
-Rookie.

14:56.740 --> 14:59.380
Keep them sharp. l like to scratch.

15:04.940 --> 15:07.370
Come on. We talked about this.

15:09.860 --> 15:11.260
Fine.

15:12.060 --> 15:15.180
Hey, Rico. There's someone here
who wants to talk to you.

15:15.220 --> 15:16.860
l'm all ears.

15:17.340 --> 15:18.410
l'm sorry.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.810
My behaviour was totally inappropriate

15:20.860 --> 15:23.820
and a disgrace
to this fine establishment.

15:24.460 --> 15:26.890
-l hate this.
-Just do it.

15:27.860 --> 15:33.170
And in no way reflects the opinion of
my diligent, hard-working son. There.

15:34.940 --> 15:38.250
What can l say?
l'm as forgiving as l am handsome.

15:39.780 --> 15:41.730
Apology accepted.

15:41.780 --> 15:44.130
Now was that so hard?

15:45.300 --> 15:48.050
You really want to rattle
the gator's cage, boy?

15:48.940 --> 15:50.340
No, sir.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.500
You're a genius.

15:53.740 --> 15:57.050
Okay, so, l guess
l'll just go back to work then.

15:57.100 --> 16:00.090
l always wondered
why he was such a loser.

16:00.140 --> 16:02.860
Now l know. He gets it from his dad.

16:03.820 --> 16:04.850
Excuse me?

16:04.900 --> 16:07.540
Talk about your country dumbkin.

16:08.540 --> 16:10.290
''Country dumbkin''?

16:14.660 --> 16:16.060
Jackson!

16:18.380 --> 16:20.610
Say it. Go on. Say it.

16:22.100 --> 16:23.820
All right, l'm sorry.

16:23.860 --> 16:26.130
-And?
-l have a big mouth.

16:26.700 --> 16:29.500
-l can't hear you.
-l have a big mouth!

16:29.980 --> 16:32.250
Now was that so hard?

16:32.300 --> 16:34.730
-This isn't funny.
-That's right.

16:35.460 --> 16:36.970
But this is.

16:46.460 --> 16:48.290
Well, we have two hours
before the ceremony.

16:48.340 --> 16:52.170
ls there anything
you or Pancake need?

16:53.060 --> 16:56.650
Randall, thanks to you,
we're right as rainbows,

16:58.220 --> 17:02.530
and Pancake is so happy
you moved his diamond home.

17:03.860 --> 17:07.569
He has a special surprise for you.

17:09.940 --> 17:12.609
Calm down, Randall. You're an adult.

17:14.579 --> 17:16.460
Hi, Randall.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.700
Hi, Pancake!

17:19.780 --> 17:21.930
You've been so wonderful.

17:21.980 --> 17:25.940
l'm making you
an honorary Buffalo Buddy.

17:27.339 --> 17:30.170
l've always wanted
to be a Buffalo Buddy.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.370
l could never collect enough box tops

17:33.420 --> 17:36.730
because my mom always said,
''Your cereal is too sugary.''

17:36.780 --> 17:38.850
Meanwhile, she was packing away
the doughnuts

17:38.900 --> 17:41.330
like they were going out of style.

17:41.980 --> 17:43.890
Now, Randall.

17:43.940 --> 17:46.770
l know. Angry voice. l'm sorry.

17:50.180 --> 17:52.980
You got a permit for this little party?

17:53.820 --> 17:56.010
Of course l do. lt's in my car.

17:56.060 --> 17:59.370
Hey, hey, hey.
l'll ask the questions around here.

18:00.220 --> 18:04.370
l wasn't asking a question, Officer...
Nancy Oken?

18:06.100 --> 18:09.770
My father named me that.
His name was Harriet.

18:11.740 --> 18:13.970
You got a problem with that?

18:14.660 --> 18:16.890
No. Not if... You don't?

18:18.580 --> 18:20.690
Just get the permit, sir.

18:22.460 --> 18:26.290
-Proceeding east with suspect.
-<i>Roger, Nancy. Phase 2 is a go</i>.

18:31.860 --> 18:37.380
l've got Bindenboudenschlasser
chocolate for you!

18:40.540 --> 18:43.810
Did somebody say
Bindenboudenschlasser chocolates?

18:43.860 --> 18:46.820
Milk the happy Swiss cows myself.

18:50.100 --> 18:51.820
Wait. Wait.

18:52.940 --> 18:56.370
Pancake, honey,
Mommy'll be back in just a sec.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.010
This permit looks good.

19:07.060 --> 19:11.260
You'd be surprised how many people
try to get fancy with the Nancy.

19:12.020 --> 19:16.690
<i>Oliver! lt's your mother</i>.
<i>Stop messing with my walkie-talkie</i>!

19:19.580 --> 19:21.090
l gotta go.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.050
Sorry about that.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.180
Miss Merriwether?

19:27.020 --> 19:31.410
Pancake? lt's me. Your Buffalo Buddy.

19:34.140 --> 19:37.290
Get over it, you snivelling little dork.

19:38.780 --> 19:39.850
What?

19:39.900 --> 19:43.450
Hey, folks, want to see
a genuine Hollywood freak?

19:43.500 --> 19:47.460
Check out the middle-aged loser
talking to a puppet.

19:48.940 --> 19:52.570
No, l'm not talking to a puppet. l...

19:52.620 --> 19:54.930
How can you say that?
We're Buffalo Buddies.

19:54.980 --> 19:58.730
Yeah, and it's a big deal.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.580
When you're three!

20:01.900 --> 20:04.250
Grow up, or do you want to
spend the rest of your life

20:04.300 --> 20:07.210
living with
your doughnut-scarfing mother?

20:08.420 --> 20:11.250
That's enough, Miss Merriwether.
That's enough!

20:11.300 --> 20:13.730
No, this is enough.

20:15.940 --> 20:19.690
That's it. l'm giving Hannah Montana
her spot back.

20:20.740 --> 20:21.930
Yes!

20:22.700 --> 20:26.660
You've just bought yourself
a one-way ticket to loogie land.

20:26.980 --> 20:28.460
<i>Kommen Si</i> e back.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.890
No, those are not real
Bindenboudenschlasser chocolates!

20:31.940 --> 20:33.740
Yeah, they are.

20:33.780 --> 20:35.580
Miss Merriwether?

20:37.300 --> 20:38.780
Pancake?

20:57.460 --> 20:58.780
Guys.

20:59.980 --> 21:01.250
Sorry.

21:01.780 --> 21:04.050
But these things are so good.

21:05.020 --> 21:07.930
Great. Even my friends
splat on my diamond.

21:07.980 --> 21:11.050
l wish l wouldn't have
even gotten this stupid thing.

21:11.100 --> 21:14.490
Mommy! Mommy!
lt's Hannah Montana's diamond.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.210
Take my picture.

21:17.380 --> 21:20.340
Looks like she thinks it's pretty cool.

21:21.460 --> 21:25.450
You know, if your fans don't care
where your diamond is...

21:25.500 --> 21:27.530
Then l shouldn't either?

21:28.340 --> 21:30.900
l guess that is what it really is all about.

21:30.940 --> 21:32.050
Pretty much.

21:32.100 --> 21:36.090
l cannot believe how nuts l went
trying to get my spot back.

21:36.140 --> 21:41.660
That's it. Set her down easy,
right on top of old Pancake Buffalo.

21:44.420 --> 21:47.170
Hey, look at that. A gift from above.

21:48.460 --> 21:49.730
l'll be right back.

21:49.780 --> 21:53.010
l gotta go leave a little something
for Pancake.

21:58.660 --> 22:01.700
Hey, where do you think
you're going, buddy?

22:01.740 --> 22:02.930
Well, l gotta...

22:03.460 --> 22:04.690
No, you don't!

22:04.740 --> 22:06.090
Yes, l do.

22:06.140 --> 22:09.260
Then try the gas station
four blocks down.

22:09.300 --> 22:12.130
Looks like you could use the exercise.

22:12.180 --> 22:14.450
What am l doing? You're a puppet.

22:14.500 --> 22:18.250
Yeah. Yeah, a puppet
that's about to knock you silly.

22:18.300 --> 22:20.250
Yeah. Yeah. Be scared.

22:20.980 --> 22:25.770
Anybody else want a piece of me?
How about you, grandma? Yeah. Yeah.
