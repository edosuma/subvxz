00:06.960 --> 00:09.560
OSHER:
Previously on The Bachelorette...

00:09.560 --> 00:12.160
Go!
(CHEERING)

00:12.160 --> 00:14.360
KURT: Go, Carissa!

00:14.360 --> 00:16.680
Carissa.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:16.680 --> 00:18.760
After an impressive run
at the track...

00:18.760 --> 00:21.360
You look stunning, by the way.
Thank you.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.920
..Carissa stalled on the couch...

00:22.920 --> 00:26.280
BROOKE: I felt this really strong
connection with her at the start.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.960
I just really didn't feel that
in the kiss.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.200
..before...

00:30.200 --> 00:32.320
I have invited four new people
to come and meet you.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.360
(GASPING)

00:34.360 --> 00:36.760
..a parade of fresh faces...

00:36.760 --> 00:38.480
You look extremely dapper.

00:38.480 --> 00:41.080
You're a very confident woman.
I actually really find that
attractive.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.000
No.
I like this energy.
(BOTH LAUGH)

00:43.000 --> 00:44.800
I, like, play Rugby.
So I'm, like, yeah.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.240
You love it.
I reckon you'd be alright.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.280
..saw one new arrival go for broke...

00:49.280 --> 00:51.000
LUCA: I'm not here
to sit around and make friends.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.240
..leaving Carissa in the cold.

00:53.240 --> 00:57.240
I don't stand a chance anymore.
I'm not OK with this.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.400
Tonight...

00:59.400 --> 01:00.680
Are you ready?
I'm ready.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.120
..Luca's first night persistence
paid off...

01:03.120 --> 01:05.440
(LAUGHS)
(SCREAMS AND LAUGHS)

01:05.440 --> 01:08.160
..not once but twice...

01:08.160 --> 01:10.120
The last name is bloody Luca.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.520
KURT: Luca's got the single date,
he's got a group date.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.080
You know, you can't get
any more time than that with Brooke.

01:15.080 --> 01:16.600
CARISSA:
I'm starting to get a little worried

01:16.600 --> 01:20.160
because it does make me
question my connection with Brooke.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.200
..before...

01:21.200 --> 01:23.520
HOLLY: This is the first time
I've ever seen Carissa anxious...

01:23.520 --> 01:25.200
Yeah.
Yeah.
..at a cocktail party,

01:25.200 --> 01:26.400
..Carissa comes clean.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.360
CARISSA: I need to share with Brooke
what is on my mind.

01:29.360 --> 01:32.960
I just don't know if I can do this.
I don't know how YOU feel.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.760
BROOKE:
I don't really have words for it.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.720
(SIGHS) It's just hard.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.760
BROOKE:
I chose Luca for this date because

01:51.760 --> 01:55.720
the impression that he made on the
arrival really had my head spinning.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.880
You look amazing.
Oh, thank you. What's your name?

01:57.880 --> 01:59.400
My name's Luca.
Luca.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.440
I'm Brooke. Nice to meet you.
It's so good to finally meet you.

02:01.440 --> 02:03.240
I'm a health and PE teacher,

02:03.240 --> 02:05.840
but I'm also, like, a
highly competitive jujitsu athlete.

02:05.840 --> 02:06.960
Wow!

02:06.960 --> 02:08.880
BROOKE: I felt a connection
with Luca straightaway.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.920
I thought he was sexy.

02:10.920 --> 02:12.560
Wrestling on the ground
seems fun to me.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.160
It is.
(LAUGHS)

02:14.160 --> 02:17.080
I feel like you're gonna be
a little bit trouble.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.200
(LAUGHS)
Oh, I can be.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.440
He was persistent.
LUCA: Sorry to interrupt.

02:20.440 --> 02:23.240
I don't know how much time
there is left, and I really want
the chance to chat with you.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.200
OK.
Yeah, give us a couple more minutes.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.280
LUCA: Two minutes.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.880
And he has
this really good confidence about him

02:27.880 --> 02:30.200
that I really am drawn to.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.680
LUCA: Did I come on too strong?
No.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.280
Is that alright?
It's good.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.480
Shakes things up a little bit.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.360
Yeah, well, I'm here for you,
not for anyone else, so...

02:36.360 --> 02:37.840
(LAUGHS) Really?

02:37.840 --> 02:41.240
BROOKE: But
Luca has come into this pretty late,

02:41.240 --> 02:45.320
so I'm just really hoping to
catch up to speed with my feelings.

02:45.320 --> 02:48.760
Today's date
is a Top-Gun-themed date.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.880
Top Gun is a very cool movie.

02:50.880 --> 02:55.280
It's about jets, planes, military.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.880
I really like action movies,
so this will be a lot of fun.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.040
Hey.
Hi.

03:02.040 --> 03:03.360
Top Gun's here.
How are you?

03:03.360 --> 03:05.480
You look amazing.
(LAUGHS)

03:05.480 --> 03:07.680
You look better and better
every time.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.240
Oh. Thank you.
How are you feeling?

03:09.240 --> 03:10.520
You look great.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.800
Oh, how are ya?
Very good.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.640
LUCA: Brooke
is standing against the Porsche,

03:14.640 --> 03:17.680
looking sexy as hell.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.680
Um...
Wow.

03:18.680 --> 03:19.840
I know. Look at the ride.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.960
I'm so excited for you.
I'm excited to be here.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.080
Um...

03:23.080 --> 03:27.240
..so, I am looking
for my Top Gun, my Maverick, like...

03:27.240 --> 03:28.320
Yep.
..my best friend.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.240
Someone who's got my back,
like, 100%.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.240
Yep.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.600
And I guess from the impression
that you made on late arrival.
Yep...

03:33.600 --> 03:36.560
You really impressed me with your
confidence and your persistence.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.280
I'm glad I did it.
I think it paid off.

03:38.280 --> 03:41.520
100%.
So today,
we're going on a very exciting date.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.880
Awesome.
Are you ready?
I'm ready.

03:43.880 --> 03:44.880
LUCA: I'm a maverick.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.720
I...I'll just go for things
when I see the opportunity.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.040
I don't really...

03:48.040 --> 03:51.160
..I don't really care too much about
the collateral that comes with it.

03:51.160 --> 03:53.160
So I'm super-amped.
I'm super-pumped.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.280
Oh, how cute is that?
(LAUGHS)

03:56.280 --> 03:57.440
We look good. You look great.
We do.

03:57.440 --> 04:00.200
And I feel like something special
is about to happen.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.120
I feel bad-ass.
You look bad-arse too.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.480
(LAUGHS AND STARTS ENGINE)

04:06.120 --> 04:09.000
Top Gun away.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.520
BROOKE: I'm really excited
for today's date

04:11.520 --> 04:14.360
because I feel like
this is a good indication

04:14.360 --> 04:17.120
to see what he's like as a partner.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.840
Pretty sexy, you driving this thing.

04:18.840 --> 04:20.600
(LAUGHS)
It's doing a bit.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.280
Is it?
Yeah.

04:22.280 --> 04:24.520
Doing things to ya?
It's doing things to me.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.480
LUCA: I've walked into
a cocktail party last night

04:26.480 --> 04:29.560
and now here I am
sitting next to Brooke in a Porsche.

04:29.560 --> 04:33.440
She looks bad-arse. She's got
the sunnies. She's got the jacket.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.240
Wind's blowing in the hair.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.760
And I had to pinch myself
and...and think,

04:36.760 --> 04:38.880
you know,
"Is this actually happening?"

04:38.880 --> 04:41.240
Yeah, you should get the man bun out.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.240
Want it out?

04:42.240 --> 04:44.880
Let's get some wind happening.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.400
(LAUGHS)

04:46.400 --> 04:48.080
Oh! (LAUGHS)

04:48.080 --> 04:50.400
(LAUGHS) It looks really good.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.960
BROOKE:
Luca's got a lot going for him.

04:51.960 --> 04:56.360
He's very charming.
He makes me laugh.

04:56.360 --> 05:00.240
I like everything at the moment.
Like, I like what I'm seeing.

05:08.520 --> 05:11.280
Are you kidding me?

05:11.280 --> 05:13.640
Holy...shit.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.680
(LAUGHS)
Wow! (LAUGHS)

05:15.680 --> 05:17.840
How bad-arse do they look?

05:17.840 --> 05:22.160
Look, I'm...
I'm feeling a little bit nervous.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.400
We're at the Camden Airport.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.720
They are epic.
Ooh!

05:26.720 --> 05:28.000
I'm so pumped.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.840
LUCA: I don't even know
what to think right now.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.080
Wow!

05:32.080 --> 05:35.640
Almost...I don't know what to say.
I'm speechless.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.880
So these ARE fighter jets,

05:37.880 --> 05:41.320
and they are used in the air force
all over the world.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.320
Wow.

05:42.320 --> 05:46.040
These beauties
go up to about 1,000km per hour.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.200
That's fast. Yep.
Yep.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.480
We're actually
gonna be going up in them.

05:49.480 --> 05:50.480
Epic.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.960
We're gonna be doing, like,
some flips,

05:51.960 --> 05:55.280
some things as jet pilots would do.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.320
I am petrified.

05:57.320 --> 05:58.720
Yeah, wow.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.080
(LAUGHS) I can't...I can't even talk.
(LAUGHS)

06:01.080 --> 06:03.000
It's big. It's massive.
Oh, I'm so scared.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.640
BROOKE: This is
a huge out of my comfort zone.

06:05.640 --> 06:08.440
I love fast things.
Like, faster the better.

06:08.440 --> 06:13.600
This is not a car, though.
This is a military fighter jet.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.000
I'm gonna be by your side
the whole time.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.320
You feeling a little bit scared?
Yeah.

06:17.320 --> 06:18.840
I'm a little bit anxious,
I must admit.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.120
Whuh!
We're in it together.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.280
So...you can rely on me.
Um...

06:22.280 --> 06:23.640
I got your back.
Thank you.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.640
LUCA:
I'm feeling a little bit nervous
going into the air at that speed,

06:26.640 --> 06:29.280
but I need
to just put all that to one side

06:29.280 --> 06:31.480
because I need to be there
for Brooke.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.640
We do have to come up
with some call sign names, though.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.840
Obviously, we'll be
communicating with one another.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.160
My initials are BB.
Yep.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.080
And I thought BB Gun.
BB Gun's perfect.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.040
Yeah? What are...
what are you thinking?

06:42.040 --> 06:43.480
I would like you to refer to me
as Gladiator.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.760
And I will be there for you...

06:44.760 --> 06:46.040
Oh! OK.
..when you need me.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.320
Perfect. Gladiator. BB Gun.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.800
(LAUGHS) I think we've got this.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.320
We've got this, 100%.
Oh, I'm so nervous. (LAUGHS)

06:52.320 --> 06:55.440
Oh, don't be nervous.
We're in it together.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.280
BROOKE: I'm, like, supposed to be
the cool, calm, collected one.

06:58.280 --> 06:59.480
I have brought Luca on this date.

06:59.480 --> 07:03.400
And here I am, like,
literally cacking my daks.

07:09.480 --> 07:13.680
I am petrified right now
in this moment.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.920
(SIGHS)
MAN: So have you got any questions
so far?

07:15.920 --> 07:18.120
No. No. No, I don't.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.760
BROOKE: I'm thinking...

07:19.760 --> 07:22.880
(LAUGHS) .."I don't want to do this."
(GASPS)

07:22.880 --> 07:24.400
But...

07:24.400 --> 07:28.880
..I'm strapped in, and
there is no backing out right now.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.840
(SIGHS AND CLEARS THROAT)

07:30.840 --> 07:34.960
MAN: Request taxi for a departure
upwind. I'm primed for take-off.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.920
BROOKE: (LAUGHS) Yeah, far out.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.040
I'm not religious,
but I'm gonna be praying today.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.000
Wow!

08:10.000 --> 08:12.880
Yes! How are you going?

08:12.880 --> 08:15.040
BROOKE: Oh, my God, this is amazing!

08:15.040 --> 08:16.640
Yay!

08:16.640 --> 08:18.240
How cool!

08:18.240 --> 08:20.840
This is epic!

08:20.840 --> 08:24.200
This is...almost as beautiful
as you are.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.680
(LAUGHS)

08:27.960 --> 08:31.200
BROOKE: Being up in the air,
flying so close to Luca,

08:31.200 --> 08:33.280
the sun is shining over the horizon.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.320
It was euphoric.

08:34.320 --> 08:35.760
Hey, Brooke,
if you look closely enough,

08:35.760 --> 08:37.560
you can see the mansion from here.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.760
(LAUGHS)
I don't want to see the mansion.

08:40.760 --> 08:46.200
BROOKE: And just watching Luca in the
window next to me in the other jet,

08:46.200 --> 08:48.160
he has not stopped smiling.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.520
Like, he's, like,
waving to me like a little kid.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.280
He's, like, blowing me kisses.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.360
I think it's so cute.

08:54.360 --> 08:58.040
He makes me feel, like, calm
and, like, protected

08:58.040 --> 09:00.400
and like everything's gonna be OK.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.120
(ENGINES ROAR)

09:02.120 --> 09:03.840
(SCREAMS AND LAUGHS)

09:06.000 --> 09:07.440
Oh, my God!

09:08.720 --> 09:11.040
(SCREAMS AND LAUGHS)

09:11.040 --> 09:13.400
What's this?

09:13.400 --> 09:14.880
(LAUGHS)

09:14.880 --> 09:17.480
Whoo! (LAUGHS)

09:17.480 --> 09:20.680
Oh, my God! (SCREAMS AND LAUGHS)

09:20.680 --> 09:22.680
Holy shit!

09:22.680 --> 09:25.200
(LAUGHS)

09:26.200 --> 09:28.120
Oh, my God!

09:28.120 --> 09:29.440
My tummy!

09:29.440 --> 09:31.520
Ooh, shit!

09:31.520 --> 09:33.440
Whoo!

09:33.440 --> 09:35.360
LUCA: This is
an amazing moment in my life.

09:35.360 --> 09:38.240
This is one of the most epic things
I've ever done.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.840
BB Gun,
this is, uh, Gladiator reporting.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.240
Just want to report
had a great flight.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.840
Thanks for being with me
on this one.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.640
BB Gun to Gladiator.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.760
That was pretty epic. I'm so stoked.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.160
I'm so glad
that we did this together.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.920
That makes me very happy to hear.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.320
This is awesome.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.480
Uh, Gladiator out.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.440
He's hilarious.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.840
Uh, honestly think
that's probably by far

10:03.840 --> 10:07.320
one of the best things
I've ever done in my life.

10:07.320 --> 10:09.080
I conquered a fear.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.840
I've pushed myself
past my comfort zone,

10:10.840 --> 10:16.200
all with the help of Luca, who made
me feel so supported the whole time.

10:16.200 --> 10:20.760
That had to be the...the coolest
thing I've ever done, I reckon.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.600
Agreed.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.800
And I don't reckon I could have
done it with anyone better.

10:25.800 --> 10:29.720
He really did prove to be
my Top Gun today.

10:29.720 --> 10:33.240
Holy shit! That was hectic.

10:33.240 --> 10:34.960
I know.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.600
Oh, my God.
You alright? Hey.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.480
These are happy tears, though.
These are, like, not sad.

10:40.480 --> 10:41.720
Like, I'm just, like...

10:41.720 --> 10:43.480
Yeah, I'm so happy I did it.
Same!

10:43.480 --> 10:44.720
I'm so happy I did it with you.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.040
Like, that was amazing.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.560
Well done. I'm proud of you.
Thank you.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.160
You know, she was really brave.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.240
Like...it was a...a worry
for her to do this,

10:53.240 --> 10:55.840
and she just tackled it head-on,

10:55.840 --> 10:58.520
and for me, that's a...
that's a massive positive.

10:58.520 --> 11:01.800
And I find that super-attractive.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.280
Well done.
Should we go celebrate?

11:03.280 --> 11:04.960
Yep. Let's do it.
Then I can stop crying.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.480
Let's go get it, babe.
OK.

11:06.480 --> 11:07.480
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

11:09.080 --> 11:10.640
OSHER: Coming up...

11:10.640 --> 11:13.920
Oh!
(CHEERING)

11:13.920 --> 11:15.400
I don't know where to look.
(HORN BLASTS)

11:15.400 --> 11:17.360
..it's a race for Brooke's heart...

11:17.360 --> 11:19.000
Every second counts.
Yes.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.240
Yes, go!
Oh!

11:20.240 --> 11:21.920
Yes!
Come back, come back, come back!

11:21.920 --> 11:23.680
I really don't want to lose this.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.360
..as new and old contenders...

11:25.360 --> 11:26.800
Oh, my God!

11:26.800 --> 11:28.240
One foot at a time.
One foot at a time.

11:28.240 --> 11:29.760
I think he was a little bit slow,
to be honest.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.320
..battle it out.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.840
The clock is ticking.
Muscle it up, big boy.
Go, Steve.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.080
Go, reach! Quick, reach!
Very close!

11:36.080 --> 11:37.120
And later...

11:37.120 --> 11:40.120
Oh, wait. Wait.
Here comes Brooke. There's Brooke.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.920
..bombshell news...

11:41.920 --> 11:43.680
BROOKE: I didn't see this coming.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.120
(SIGHS) It's just hard.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.720
..pushes Brooke to the brink...

11:47.720 --> 11:49.160
I'm a little bit upset.

11:49.160 --> 11:52.400
And I'm gonna call it tonight.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.480
..sending shock waves
through the mansion.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.200
That's big.
WOMAN: Wow.
WOMAN 2: Holy shit.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.160
I did not expect that.

11:59.160 --> 12:01.600
Wow. I'm just shocked.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.160
MILLIE:
Waiting for Luca to come back.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.880
I think a lot of people
are sort of chatting about

12:16.880 --> 12:19.200
what they think, or they hope,

12:19.200 --> 12:22.720
isn't gonna happen, or
didn't happen, on this single date.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.680
I just don't want to...
To see him as a threat?

12:24.680 --> 12:25.680
Yeah.
Yeah.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.040
See, I don't see YOU as a threat
because we're so different.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.800
That's...same.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.600
MILLIE: So, it is a little bit,

12:31.600 --> 12:33.240
like, there's
a little bit of tension in the air.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.480
Yeah, I think he's probably having
the time of his life. (LAUGHS)

12:35.480 --> 12:37.480
Yeah.
I don't think there's gonna be
much middle ground.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.760
Hey, guys!
OTHERS: Whoa!

12:39.760 --> 12:41.520
Look what I have!
OTHERS: Hooray!

12:41.520 --> 12:44.000
This card.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.520
Come on! Up here.
Oh, God.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.080
OTHERS: Yay! Whoo!

12:47.080 --> 12:52.080
I'm really excited
to have a card in my hands.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.920
So, what do you think we have here?

12:53.920 --> 12:55.720
OTHERS: Group date.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.000
100%.
Gotta be.
100%.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.200
I can confirm it is a group date.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.880
OTHERS: Yeah!

13:01.880 --> 13:04.560
CARISSA: Who's really feeling
like they need the extra time

13:04.560 --> 13:06.080
and want to be on this card?

13:06.080 --> 13:07.480
Yes.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.200
What about you, Carissa?
Definitely.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.120
I 100% would love
to be on this group date.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.880
Yeah, just doesn't feel like
I've had enough time.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.800
CARISSA: I was pretty gutted
that I missed out on the single date,

13:16.800 --> 13:20.720
because I didn't get time with Brooke
at the last cocktail party.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.320
I'm definitely
wanting any opportunity

13:22.320 --> 13:25.800
to spend more time with Brooke
and build a connection.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.360
So, hopefully... (LAUGHS)

13:27.360 --> 13:29.160
CARISSA: I had a great connection
with Brooke

13:29.160 --> 13:31.280
at our last extended time together,

13:31.280 --> 13:34.800
and I felt that we had
an instant spark, instant chemistry,

13:34.800 --> 13:39.080
so I'm really hoping
that I'm on this date.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.760
The first name is...

13:40.760 --> 13:41.840
..Darvid.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.560
CONTESTANTS: Yay!

13:43.560 --> 13:44.600
Whoo-hoo!
CARISSA: Holly.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.840
CONTESTANTS: Yay!

13:46.840 --> 13:49.120
Kurt.
Yay!

13:49.120 --> 13:51.000
Steve.
CONTESTANTS: Yay!

13:51.000 --> 13:52.320
I start reading out the names.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.440
The next name is Jessica.
Hey!

13:54.440 --> 13:55.440
CONTESTANTS: Hey!

13:55.440 --> 13:56.840
(APPLAUSE)

13:56.840 --> 14:00.960
I notice my name's
not on this group date.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.360
Millie.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

14:03.360 --> 14:04.880
Will.

14:04.880 --> 14:05.880
MAN: Here we go.
(APPLAUSE)

14:05.880 --> 14:07.920
All the newbies.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.560
I have been trying so hard
to get to know Brooke

14:09.560 --> 14:11.840
and to build a connection with her

14:11.840 --> 14:14.160
and I'm feeling pretty deflated.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.840
The last name is bloody Luca.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.520
You're kidding.
CARISSA: I am not kidding.

14:23.520 --> 14:25.560
Luca's a little greedy, now,
isn't he?

14:25.560 --> 14:27.520
KURT: You know, Luca's walked in,
he's got the single date,

14:27.520 --> 14:28.800
he's got a group date.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.320
You know, you
can't get any more time than that

14:30.320 --> 14:32.080
with Brooke in 24 hours.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.280
So we're all
a little bit pissed off.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.320
Probably can tell
how I'm feeling about it.

14:36.320 --> 14:40.240
Oh, my God! I'm not happy either.
(LAUGHS)

14:40.240 --> 14:41.880
Luca has come in out of nowhere

14:41.880 --> 14:43.520
and appears
to have caught Brooke's attention.

14:43.520 --> 14:46.120
And I'm starting to get
a little worried

14:46.120 --> 14:49.960
because it does make me question
my connection with Brooke

14:49.960 --> 14:52.640
when everyone else
is getting more time with her.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.200
Oh!
Hello.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.680
How are you?
(LAUGHS) Good.

15:08.680 --> 15:11.200
I'm still coming up from that...
that whole experience.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.200
Yeah?

15:12.200 --> 15:14.480
BROOKE: We've just overcome
going on fighter jets together.

15:14.480 --> 15:19.880
I feel like that in itself,
as a relationship, is huge,

15:19.880 --> 15:22.280
but I think
all the commotions are over,

15:22.280 --> 15:26.960
so I really want to get to know Luca
now, like, as a person.

15:26.960 --> 15:27.960
How do you feel?
I know.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.320
I can't believe, like,
we just did that, because...

15:30.320 --> 15:33.840
..I was thinking about it, I'm, like,
"No, I don't know much about you.

15:33.840 --> 15:37.840
"And I'm just gonna throw myself
in a...a fighter jet and just...

15:37.840 --> 15:41.440
"..hope that he's got my back
and I've got his," and then...

15:41.440 --> 15:43.520
..yeah, it turned out to be,
like, an amazing day.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.960
So it was really nice
to have you there.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.560
Because I was absolutely petrified.
Yeah.

15:47.560 --> 15:51.040
You helped me conquer
huge fears today.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.920
So...
No. That's what
a relationship's about, you know.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.600
Being there
for the thick and the thin.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.040
Mmm.
I wanted to be there for you.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.760
'Cause I know how nervous you were
at the start, and just, yeah,

15:58.760 --> 16:01.160
looking over
and seeing you there smiling and...

16:01.160 --> 16:03.840
..couldn't see that moment
being with anyone else but you.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.040
That's nice.

16:05.040 --> 16:08.560
When you came on arrivals, you...

16:08.560 --> 16:10.880
..came in red-hot,

16:10.880 --> 16:12.760
maybe stirred the pot
a little bit, but...

16:12.760 --> 16:15.360
Yeah.
..you seem very confident.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.720
I don't...

16:16.720 --> 16:19.240
..worry about anyone else, you know.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.880
I'm here to show
the best version of myself and...

16:21.880 --> 16:24.000
Mmm.
..show you who I am as a person.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.080
Are you a fierce competitor?

16:26.080 --> 16:27.840
I'm a very fierce competitor.

16:27.840 --> 16:31.120
I fight for what I love
and make a real big effort...

16:31.120 --> 16:32.920
Yeah.
..to show that I'm there.

16:32.920 --> 16:36.800
I do that with my family. I do that
with my jujitsu and my sport.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.880
If I get a silver or a bronze medal,
I am so angry.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.240
So...if I don't go away
with the gold,

16:41.240 --> 16:43.040
I'm actually gonna sook
for, like, three days,

16:43.040 --> 16:44.280
until I'm ready for the next one.

16:44.280 --> 16:45.280
So...
Yeah.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.920
..I think I do that
with everything in life and...

16:46.920 --> 16:47.920
You're very driven.
Yeah.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.760
That's good.
You're the gold medal.
I'm the gold medal?

16:49.760 --> 16:51.720
You're the gold medal. So...
(LAUGHS)

16:51.720 --> 16:53.360
I knew I was gonna go in
and people were gonna be,

16:53.360 --> 16:55.120
you know, "Who's this guy," but...

16:55.120 --> 16:56.520
..I think I made it pretty clear...

16:56.520 --> 16:58.160
Mmm.
..as to what I came here for.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.000
I think you did too. (LAUGHS)
Yeah.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.240
I can definitely say
I've felt a connection with you

17:04.240 --> 17:06.640
which I haven't felt with someone
for a long time,

17:06.640 --> 17:09.240
and you seem
really genuine and honest

17:09.240 --> 17:10.240
and obviously very pretty.

17:10.240 --> 17:11.960
Like, you just tick all the boxes.
Thank you.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.120
Um...

17:13.120 --> 17:14.600
What are your boxes?

17:14.600 --> 17:16.000
You. Everything.
(LAUGHS)

17:16.000 --> 17:17.520
Just tick...tick 'em all.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.720
Keep going. I'm fishing.
Yeah.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.920
Uh, I think you've got
everything that, you know,

17:21.920 --> 17:23.880
I want in a partner,
and I just haven't found that yet.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.280
Oh.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.760
I...I...I really like you.
I think you're really cool.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.320
Glad we think the same. (LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

17:30.320 --> 17:32.000
"I think you're really cool."

17:32.000 --> 17:34.040
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God.
I sound like a teenager.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.440
(LAUGHS) Really cool.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.480
I think you're really cool too.
Oh, thank you.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.600
And I'd like to sort of continue...

17:39.600 --> 17:41.640
..this.

17:41.640 --> 17:42.760
So...
So would I.

17:42.760 --> 17:45.200
(LAUGHS)
Oh.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.560
Ooh.
Oh!

17:47.560 --> 17:48.600
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

17:48.600 --> 17:50.000
So...

17:50.000 --> 17:51.800
..Luca...

17:51.800 --> 17:53.280
Brooke.
(LAUGHS)

17:53.280 --> 17:56.080
(LAUGHS)
..will you accept this rose?

17:56.080 --> 17:58.120
I will definitely accept this rose.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.560
Beautiful. Thank you.
It means a lot to me.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.280
Yeah. I'm glad.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.800
Thank you.
Thank you.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.720
LUCA: Being high up in the clouds
in a fighter jet

18:09.720 --> 18:11.400
was an amazing experience,

18:11.400 --> 18:14.880
but I don't think it comes close
to a kiss with Brooke.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.720
I think it'd be hard to not
easily fall in love with Brooke.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.880
She's an amazing individual,
and it feels like I've known her

18:20.880 --> 18:22.720
for a lot longer
than what I actually have.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.640
I don't think I've felt like this
with someone before.

18:24.640 --> 18:28.560
So, I'm feeling
top of the world right now.

18:40.200 --> 18:43.120
Oh, what are we doing?

18:43.120 --> 18:44.880
Looks like an obstacle course.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.720
Today, we are on our group date

18:46.720 --> 18:49.440
and we have arrived
at an obstacle course.

18:49.440 --> 18:50.520
I'm keen.
I love this.

18:50.520 --> 18:51.640
I'm keen.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.640
Yes, this is gonna...
this is gonna be good.

18:53.640 --> 18:56.280
It feels like today is gonna be
an OGs versus the intruders

18:56.280 --> 18:57.640
kind of day.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.040
You know, for the OGs, we've gelled

18:59.040 --> 19:01.800
over the time we've been here
from the start, and...

19:01.800 --> 19:03.920
..when intruders come in
and...and kick four OGs out,

19:03.920 --> 19:06.120
it's gonna create
a little bit of hostility,

19:06.120 --> 19:08.280
it's gonna
create a little bit of tension.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.920
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. You
ready to get the heart rate up today?

19:10.920 --> 19:13.040
CONTESTANTS: Yes! Absolutely.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.920
Brooke, tell me about keeping active.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.560
You...you take it pretty seriously,
don't you?

19:16.560 --> 19:18.960
Yeah, you're right, Osher.
I do love being physically active.

19:18.960 --> 19:22.920
I love the dopamines. I
love the rush of, like, adrenaline.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.440
But it's not always about
staying fit.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.280
It's more about
what it can do for my mental health.

19:27.280 --> 19:30.320
OSHER: Now, bear in mind,
Brooke is not just interested

19:30.320 --> 19:32.800
in finding someone who shares
her passion for staying active.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.720
She's also looking for someone
who has great intuition

19:35.720 --> 19:39.400
and someone
with great communication skills.

19:39.400 --> 19:45.080
So, in two teams, you are gonna
be tackling this obstacle course.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.960
(CHEERING)

19:46.960 --> 19:50.400
I'm a very active sort of person and
I feel like I'm in my element here.

19:50.400 --> 19:51.880
It's like
a big playground for me, so...

19:51.880 --> 19:54.360
..really looking forward to getting
out there and having a crack.

19:54.360 --> 19:58.680
Before you go for each obstacle,
you will need to answer a question.

19:58.680 --> 20:04.200
Whoever knows Brooke the best
will have a clear advantage here.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.720
The fastest team
to complete the course,

20:06.720 --> 20:11.120
climb the ropes at the end
and ring the bell will win.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.640
And the best part
is that Brooke will choose

20:13.640 --> 20:16.120
one person from that winning team

20:16.120 --> 20:19.640
to spend some time alone with
later tonight.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.320
So Osher states
that it's not all about physical,

20:21.320 --> 20:24.160
it's about intuition and
communication with these obstacles,

20:24.160 --> 20:26.440
and...you know,
I've been on four group dates now,

20:26.440 --> 20:28.720
so I've seen
a lot of different sides to Brooke,

20:28.720 --> 20:31.960
so I think that can work
in my favour as well today.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.920
Teamwork will be
a clear advantage here,

20:33.920 --> 20:38.040
so you will be competing
with the people that YOU know best.

20:38.040 --> 20:42.960
So...Kurt, Darvid, Steve and Holly...

20:42.960 --> 20:45.440
Yeah!
OGs!
The OGs.

20:45.440 --> 20:51.160
..teamed up against
Luca, Will, Millie and Jessica.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.440
HOLLY:
I think the OGs have the upper hand

20:53.440 --> 20:55.160
just knowing Brooke
for a little bit longer.

20:55.160 --> 20:57.640
You know, the newbies have come in
just the other day.

20:57.640 --> 21:00.160
Only Luca's had time to
really spend a bit of time with her.

21:00.160 --> 21:03.120
So...hoping
that falls in our favour.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.240
Have you guys come up
with some team names?

21:05.240 --> 21:07.080
Uh, the OGs.
We're just going the OGs.

21:07.080 --> 21:10.480
Yeah, the Original Gangsters.
Yeah, boy!

21:10.480 --> 21:11.880
The Underdogs?
Yeah.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.440
Do you want to go with that?
Underdogs?

21:13.440 --> 21:15.240
Are you naming yourself
the Underdogs?

21:15.240 --> 21:16.760
'Cause they always win.
OSHER: Alright.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.440
Well, then, Underdogs...

21:18.440 --> 21:20.080
..if you head to the viewing gallery.

21:20.080 --> 21:21.800
OGs. Get ready to go.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.160
'Cause it's about to happen.
CONTESTANTS: Whoo!

21:24.160 --> 21:25.440
Good luck, guys.
See you later, guys.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.760
LUCA: I'm super-pumped
to get out there with the Underdogs

21:27.760 --> 21:29.560
and give the OGs
a run for their money.

21:29.560 --> 21:31.440
We're fitter. We're better-looking.
We're smarter.

21:31.440 --> 21:33.800
I think we're gonna do
really, really well.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.920
And I don't think the OGs
are gonna know what's hit them.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.200
Are you guys ready to go?
We're ready.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.680
Oh!
(CHEERING)

21:42.680 --> 21:44.520
I thought it's only fair.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.240
You right there, Brooke?
I don't know where to look.

21:46.240 --> 21:49.200
You don't know where to look?
BROOKE: How many abs does he have?

21:49.200 --> 21:51.240
It's totally 'ab-normal'.

21:51.240 --> 21:53.200
(LAUGHS)

21:53.200 --> 21:55.160
Thanks, Steve.
I really appreciate it.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.200
(LAUGHTER)

21:57.200 --> 21:58.600
Steve's abs are insane, though.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.280
(LAUGHTER)
Don't say that!

22:01.280 --> 22:03.920
Here we go, in three, two, one!

22:03.920 --> 22:05.440
(BLASTS HORN)
Go!

22:06.600 --> 22:07.760
KURT: Osher blows the horn

22:07.760 --> 22:09.840
and we're immediately running
to the first question.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.440
Everyone's feeling pretty good.

22:11.440 --> 22:15.280
"After a long week at work, the
first thing Brooke wants to do is?

22:15.280 --> 22:18.520
"Catch up with friends,
go hiking, sleep in,

22:18.520 --> 22:19.680
"watch a movie on the couch?"

22:19.680 --> 22:20.840
Watch a movie
on the couch.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.240
Watch a movie on the couch.
I reckon this one if it's not right.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.640
Yep.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.280
The team thinks the answer is
movies on the couch.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.240
I didn't really think
that was the right answer.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.320
You know, I'm thinking in my head
that it's sleeping in.

22:31.320 --> 22:33.680
After a long week at work, the
first thing Brooke wants to do is?

22:33.680 --> 22:35.160
Watch a movie on the couch?
BROOKE: No!

22:35.160 --> 22:36.960
No!

22:36.960 --> 22:38.720
KURT:
The team get the first answer wrong.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.440
It was kind of gut-wrenching
'cause I knew

22:40.440 --> 22:41.920
it just wasn't the right answer.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.160
It has to be sleep in.
Definitely.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.560
Sleep in.
Sleep in? OK, go.

22:45.560 --> 22:46.680
Sleep in.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.400
Yes.
Thanks.
Sleep in!

22:48.400 --> 22:51.920
Getting that first question wrong,
uh, we're not off to the best start.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.120
Oh, my God!

22:53.120 --> 22:54.880
One foot at a time.
One foot at a time.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.480
STEVE: There's some seconds
being lost on this.

22:56.480 --> 22:57.960
Let's go, team. Let's go, let's go.

22:57.960 --> 23:01.280
And... (LAUGHS)
..the clock is ticking.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.840
"What is Brooke's
favourite way to relax?

23:02.840 --> 23:04.720
"Meditation,

23:04.720 --> 23:08.080
"getting a massage, day out
with friends, going to the beach?"

23:08.080 --> 23:10.480
I'd say going to the beach.

23:10.480 --> 23:11.840
KURT: We get to the next question

23:11.840 --> 23:15.680
and I am very firm on the answer
being going to the beach.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.840
What do you reckon? Go with this?
Day out with friends? Yeah.
Yep.

23:17.840 --> 23:19.400
HOLLY: Kurt thinks it's the beach

23:19.400 --> 23:21.760
and the rest of us think
it's hanging out with friends,

23:21.760 --> 23:23.680
so...majority rules.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.760
I have a feeling it might have
actually been going to the beach.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.760
KURT: The team decides to go with
another different answer

23:27.760 --> 23:30.920
to what I said, and I'm starting
to get a little bit frustrated.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.040
I feel like I know the answers,

23:32.040 --> 23:34.600
but I feel like
my voice really isn't being heard.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.720
The question is, uh,
what's your favourite way to relax?

23:36.720 --> 23:38.640
Day out with friends?

23:38.640 --> 23:40.360
No.
Oh!

23:40.360 --> 23:43.800
Oh, no, we've done it again.
We've got this one wrong.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.440
Gonna cost us some valuable seconds.

23:45.440 --> 23:47.080
BROOKE:
They've been here the longest,

23:47.080 --> 23:48.800
so they should know more about me.

23:48.800 --> 23:52.840
I'm very, very, uh, open about
how I love the beach and the coast.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.840
I reckon the beach.
Go to the beach?
Go to the beach.

23:54.840 --> 23:56.320
Go to the beach?
Go.
Yeah, go.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.440
You know, it might be the difference
between winning or losing.

23:58.440 --> 24:01.680
It could come back to bite us.
So...I'm worried.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.160
I'm worried about our position
right now.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.840
Go to the beach?

24:04.840 --> 24:06.480
Yes. Yes, that's...
Yes!

24:06.480 --> 24:07.680
(LAUGHS)

24:07.680 --> 24:09.440
They've stumbled
at a couple of questions here.

24:09.440 --> 24:12.440
LUCA: The OGs, being here a bit
longer, knowing more about Brooke,

24:12.440 --> 24:14.680
you'd think they wouldn't
get as many questions wrong,

24:14.680 --> 24:17.920
but they did, which, you know,
dragged their time out a little bit.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.560
Let's go! Let's go!

24:19.560 --> 24:22.680
I'm exhausted
just from watching them.

24:22.680 --> 24:23.840
This is all the stuff that I love,

24:23.840 --> 24:25.560
like, being outdoors
on the weekends,

24:25.560 --> 24:27.680
doing sports,
getting down and dirty,

24:27.680 --> 24:30.960
and seeing them throw themselves
into the challenges,

24:30.960 --> 24:34.440
it's just nice to see
that there's some compatibility.

24:34.440 --> 24:37.600
"How does Brooke like to
share the chores around the house?

24:37.600 --> 24:39.240
"On her own, 50/50,

24:39.240 --> 24:40.880
"get a cleaner, 'It's all on you'?"

24:40.880 --> 24:42.080
50/50.
50/50.

24:43.120 --> 24:44.400
Every second counts.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.640
So I'm just praying
that we can get the answer right.

24:47.640 --> 24:49.960
How does Brooke like
to share the chores around the house?

24:49.960 --> 24:51.440
50/50.

24:52.440 --> 24:53.960
Yep.
Yes!

24:53.960 --> 24:56.200
(LAUGHS) Yeah!
Nice!

24:56.200 --> 24:57.840
A+. We got it right.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.720
And I'm running as fast as I can
back to Steve

24:59.720 --> 25:01.400
so we can finish this off.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.400
Yeah, go. Muscle it up, big boy.

25:03.400 --> 25:04.480
Go, Steve!
Go, Stevie!

25:04.480 --> 25:05.600
Go, Steve.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.080
STEVE:
I'm absolutely going for this.

25:07.080 --> 25:10.960
My team's relying on me and
the clock is still ticking, so...

25:10.960 --> 25:12.200
..we needed to be done quick.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.320
Go, Steve!
You're very close!

25:14.320 --> 25:15.800
That's it.

25:15.800 --> 25:17.320
Come on, Steve!
Grab it!

25:17.320 --> 25:18.480
Hit it!
(BELL RINGS)

25:18.480 --> 25:21.760
(CHEERING)
(HORN BLASTS)

25:21.760 --> 25:23.920
(LAUGHS) That was amazing.
That was intense.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.760
Think he was a little bit slow,
to be honest.

25:25.760 --> 25:29.200
I think getting the questions wrong
and rushing it slowed them down.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.400
I reckon
we got a good chance at this.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.680
LUCA: After watching the OGs do
that, I think we're gonna smoke 'em.

25:32.680 --> 25:35.600
They didn't look too quick, they
stumbled on some questions, so...

25:35.600 --> 25:37.680
..I reckon we got this in the bag.

25:49.480 --> 25:52.200
but it's not
just your average obstacle course.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.000
Whoa, I'm pumped!

25:54.000 --> 25:55.720
BROOKE: It's about
intuition and communication

25:55.720 --> 25:57.840
and basically, like,
who's been paying attention

25:57.840 --> 26:00.240
about who I am as a person.

26:00.240 --> 26:04.160
The teams are split into
the newbies and the originals,

26:04.160 --> 26:07.440
and someone
from the team with the fastest time

26:07.440 --> 26:10.360
will win some alone time with me.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.560
We got this. I reckon we got this.
OGs.

26:12.560 --> 26:13.560
Oh, hang on a second here.

26:13.560 --> 26:16.160
Oh! Get the rig out!

26:16.160 --> 26:18.000
Oh. Of course
Luca's taking his rig off.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.480
Wow!
(LAUGHTER)

26:19.480 --> 26:21.280
Can't stand too close.
I might cut myself.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.640
Look what you started, Steve!

26:22.640 --> 26:24.520
Love it.

26:24.520 --> 26:26.640
Like, a big act to follow, boys.

26:26.640 --> 26:29.000
Luca and Will,
shirts off straightaway.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.200
I wouldn't have taken my shirt off
after you, dude.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.080
It's like Aladdin's, uh,
less in shape brother.

26:33.080 --> 26:35.640
(LAUGHTER)
Faladdin.

26:35.640 --> 26:36.960
Faladdin.
Oh!

26:36.960 --> 26:38.040
(LAUGHTER)

26:38.040 --> 26:41.400
I think I set the trend here,
but, hey, I think I did it better.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.000
Bunch of copycats.
OSHER: Underdogs!

26:44.000 --> 26:46.040
Are you ready?
TEAM: Yes!

26:46.040 --> 26:47.440
Three, two, one!

26:47.440 --> 26:49.120
(BLASTS HORN)
(LAUGHTER)

26:49.120 --> 26:52.120
We are off like a bull at the gates.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.880
"According to Brooke,
how long should you wait

26:53.880 --> 26:56.640
"before sending a message
after a first date?

"Within an hour, the next day,

26:58.120 --> 27:00.320
"a week later, three days later?"

27:00.320 --> 27:02.520
WOMEN: Within an hour.
OK, let's go.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.840
LUCA: We're the newbies. We haven't
had as much time with Brooke.

27:04.840 --> 27:07.480
So I really don't want to lose this.

27:07.480 --> 27:08.840
We are here to win.

27:08.840 --> 27:10.200
So the question is,
according to Brooke,

27:10.200 --> 27:13.120
how long should you wait before you
send a message after a first date?

27:13.120 --> 27:14.360
Within an hour.

27:14.360 --> 27:15.600
Yes.
Yes! Go!

27:15.600 --> 27:17.640
Oh! Oh!
Come back, come back, come back!

27:17.640 --> 27:19.760
Yes - so happy we got that right.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.280
Good work, girls.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.400
MILLIE: ..considering
we haven't been here for very long,

27:23.400 --> 27:25.520
so definitely a good start,

27:25.520 --> 27:27.200
starting off on the right foot
for this one.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.840
You got it. Almost there.
Come on.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.120
Nice, guys.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.560
They're nailing this so far.
Yeah, good job, guys.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.160
"When working away,

27:34.160 --> 27:35.280
"how many times a week does Brooke

27:35.280 --> 27:36.280
"like to talk on the phone

27:36.280 --> 27:37.320
"to her partner?

27:37.320 --> 27:40.960
"21? 27? 14? 28?"

27:40.960 --> 27:42.800
Twice a day, maybe? Twice a day?
Yeah, twice a day. Yeah.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.120
14? Go.

27:45.440 --> 27:46.840
14?
No.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.040
Ah!

27:48.040 --> 27:50.560
Yeah, getting the first question
wrong, uh, it sucks...

27:50.560 --> 27:51.920
I reckon it's out of these two.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.880
Go seven, go seven.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.800
..and chewed up
a little bit of time on the clock.

27:55.800 --> 27:56.800
Seven.

27:56.800 --> 27:57.840
Yep.
Seven it is!

27:57.840 --> 28:00.880
It makes you look like
you don't know much about Brooke.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.000
Right arm, left leg.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.760
Yeah, Luca,
you're almost there, mate.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.840
So, I don't want
to get one wrong again.

28:05.840 --> 28:08.280
Good work. Let's go.
Straight over, straight over.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.680
It's anyone's game still, Brooke.

28:10.680 --> 28:13.880
"What is Brooke's number one pet
peeve when it comes to bad comms?

28:13.880 --> 28:15.400
"Apologising too much, yelling..."

28:15.400 --> 28:16.520
Yelling.
Yelling.

28:16.520 --> 28:19.920
Go. Run. Run.
Come on, Will!

28:19.920 --> 28:22.480
(PANTS) Is it yelling?
No.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.600
Ah!
Yes!
Oh!

28:24.600 --> 28:27.160
Yes, yes, yes! They're getting 'em
wrong. They're getting 'em wrong.

28:27.160 --> 28:29.520
The Underdogs, they're
getting a few questions wrong,

28:29.520 --> 28:31.400
and, you know, this
is precious time they're losing.

28:31.400 --> 28:34.240
Not listening. Not listening.
Go.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.160
For them,
it's really slowing them down.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.160
Not listening.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.040
No.
OSHER: Oh!

28:39.040 --> 28:41.320
Sorry.
Well, look at it this way.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.320
Your chances of getting it right
are getting bigger!

28:43.320 --> 28:44.840
Come on!

28:44.840 --> 28:47.040
Shit. We're losing time.
We're getting questions wrong.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.840
Is this gonna affect us
as a...as a whole?

28:49.840 --> 28:52.320
Go, go, go.
(PANTS)

28:52.320 --> 28:54.000
Guys, I think
we've got this in the bag.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.880
I know.
I think we were a lot quicker.

28:55.880 --> 28:57.360
Hello, hello. (PANTS)

28:57.360 --> 28:58.880
Creating distance?

28:58.880 --> 29:01.080
Yep.
Yay, Jessica, got it right!

29:01.080 --> 29:04.160
MILLIE: So it's final moments.
It's really crunch time.

29:04.160 --> 29:08.200
We run straight over
to the rope climb.

29:08.200 --> 29:11.000
Go, Will! Go, Will!

29:11.000 --> 29:13.760
Good job, guys!
Come on, Will.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.520
He's quick.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.400
Go, reach! Quick, reach!
Come on!

29:17.400 --> 29:18.400
(BELL RINGS)
Reach!

29:18.400 --> 29:21.160
(HORN BLASTS)
OSHER: Oh, absolutely huge!

29:22.440 --> 29:25.080
What an effort.
What an incredible effort.

29:25.080 --> 29:27.760
I'm just thinking,
have we done enough to win?

29:27.760 --> 29:29.600
Well done.
Well done.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.720
Have we done enough
to get it over the OGs

29:31.720 --> 29:35.760
and have we done enough to secure
some extra time with Brooke?

29:35.760 --> 29:38.520
God! I reckon this is gonna be
really tough, Osher.

29:38.520 --> 29:42.120
It's gonna be so close. I actually
don't know who's gonna win.

29:42.120 --> 29:45.600
And regardless of, like, who wins,
I don't know who I'm gonna choose.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.520
It's gonna be so hard
to pick one person.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.680
How was that? Was it good?

29:49.680 --> 29:51.160
Yes.
Yep. Yeah.
Yeah.

29:51.160 --> 29:54.360
OK. So, OGs, what was it like
watching the Underdogs have a go?

29:54.360 --> 29:55.840
Wasn't too scared.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.520
(LAUGHTER)

29:57.520 --> 30:00.040
I really don't want the OGs
to get some extra time with Brooke.

30:00.040 --> 30:02.480
You know, they've been here
for longer than us.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.080
So I'm really hoping that one of us

30:04.080 --> 30:06.280
can secure
that extra time with Brooke.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.680
OSHER: You were so fast.
I can't believe how quick you were.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.520
But there can be only one winner.

30:11.520 --> 30:14.240
Waiting round to hear our times,
I know this one's gonna be close.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.280
I mean, we lost some time.
They lost some time.

30:16.280 --> 30:18.120
Could go either way at this point.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.040
Underdogs. You were so fast.

30:20.040 --> 30:24.240
Guys, you made it through
in eight minutes and 38 seconds.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.320
Hey! Not bad.

30:25.320 --> 30:27.440
That was...
Not bad.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.160
..very, very, very quick.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.160
How do you think they went,
Underdogs?

30:31.160 --> 30:32.760
Nine easy.
Nine minutes?

30:32.760 --> 30:34.120
Nine.
Nine?

30:34.120 --> 30:35.920
OGs, you did it in eight minutes...

30:35.920 --> 30:37.480
Oh!
Ooh!

30:37.480 --> 30:39.240
..and four seconds.

30:39.240 --> 30:40.640
(CHEERING)

30:40.640 --> 30:42.840
Yeah! (LAUGHS)

30:42.840 --> 30:45.520
Oh! OG! (LAUGHS)

30:45.520 --> 30:48.320
OSHER: Such a narrow margin,
only 34 seconds.

30:48.320 --> 30:51.720
(SIGHS) Yes! OGs for the win.

30:51.720 --> 30:54.520
Mmm! God, that feels good.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.200
OSHER: Congratulations, OGs.
You've taken this one out.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.960
The cherry on top, though,

30:58.960 --> 31:01.200
is that Brooke
will choose one of you now

31:01.200 --> 31:04.040
to spend a little more time with
later this evening.

31:04.040 --> 31:07.400
Oh!
Man. This is nerve-racking.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.360
I've been on four group dates now

31:09.360 --> 31:11.320
and missed it the past three,

31:11.320 --> 31:14.120
so I personally
really want the time with Brooke.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.360
I haven't had
a whole lot of time with Brooke,

31:16.360 --> 31:18.360
so for me to get that extra time,
it would mean the world to me.

31:18.360 --> 31:22.160
It has been so hard
to choose today, honestly.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.960
I think the energy
was so fierce and so high.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.200
But I feel like choosing someone

31:27.200 --> 31:30.720
wasn't about, I guess,
the physical aspect.

31:30.720 --> 31:33.160
It was about someone
that has been listening to me,

31:33.160 --> 31:36.360
someone
who has paid attention, so...

31:36.360 --> 31:38.920
..person that I'm taking
on the date extension

31:38.920 --> 31:39.920
is Kurt.

31:39.920 --> 31:43.720
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Yes, Kurt!

31:43.720 --> 31:45.040
Yay! (LAUGHS)

31:45.040 --> 31:47.480
OSHER: Yeah!
Have a fantastic night, you two.

31:47.480 --> 31:49.000
(BOTH LAUGH)
Yay!

31:49.000 --> 31:50.520
KURT: I'm ecstatic.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.280
I think it's the biggest smile
I've ever produced in my life.

31:53.280 --> 31:54.800
See you guys later.
OTHERS: Bye.

31:54.800 --> 31:55.920
KURT: Made me feel over the moon.

31:55.920 --> 31:59.240
I just...was just so excited to...
to spend some time with her.

31:59.240 --> 32:00.960
You all played really well.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.560
I'm sure you're looking forward
to a warm shower

32:02.560 --> 32:04.360
and a foam roller
back at the mansion, yeah?

32:04.360 --> 32:06.200
Yeah.
Alright. Thanks, guys. Well done.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.600
Have a good one.
Thank you.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.120
OSHER: Coming up...

32:09.120 --> 32:11.240
You OK?
You right?

32:11.240 --> 32:12.440
She does not look happy.

32:12.440 --> 32:13.800
..the shocking moment...

32:13.800 --> 32:16.040
(SIGHS) It's just hard.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.280
..that sends Brooke...

32:17.280 --> 32:18.960
I'm a little bit upset.

32:18.960 --> 32:20.600
..over the edge.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.280
I'm gonna call it tonight.

32:22.280 --> 32:23.840
Wow!

32:23.840 --> 32:27.720
I did not expect that.
Wow, I'm just shocked.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.320
OSHER: Want the inside scoop?

32:38.320 --> 32:39.840
only on 10 play.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.440
Isn't this pretty?
Yeah, this is nice.

32:52.440 --> 32:54.840
BROOKE: I've been wanting to get
to know Kurt for a little while now,

32:54.840 --> 32:56.720
but I don't know too much about him

32:56.720 --> 32:59.320
besides the fact
that he was a competitive swimmer.

32:59.320 --> 33:03.280
In the past,
I've dated the "good-looking athlete"

33:03.280 --> 33:05.920
that has everything going for them,

33:05.920 --> 33:08.520
and they haven't really
been ready for a relationship.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.440
Cheers.
Cheers.
(BOTTLES CLINK)

33:10.440 --> 33:12.280
Thanks for inviting me out.
Mmm.

33:12.280 --> 33:16.840
So going into tonight, I really want
to get to know him a little bit more.

33:16.840 --> 33:18.840
Did you enjoy today?
I really enjoyed today.

33:18.840 --> 33:20.640
Mmm.
Yeah.
Yeah.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.680
No, I bet.
But you enjoyed today?
Yeah, it was good. Yeah.

33:22.680 --> 33:24.760
I guess I haven't
had much single time with you,

33:24.760 --> 33:28.440
but I feel like
I answered a few questions today

33:28.440 --> 33:30.560
that no-one else kind of knew.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.640
But I was watching
and knew you had some confidence

33:32.640 --> 33:35.320
in, like,
the questions that you answered.

33:35.320 --> 33:36.400
Yeah.
Which you should.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.120
'Cause it feels like
you've been paying attention.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.280
Yeah.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.240
I...I wanted to ask,
'cause I think...

33:41.240 --> 33:42.960
..in our group dates,
we don't really get to talk.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.680
No.
But don't think that I don't...

33:44.680 --> 33:46.880
I'm just smiling at you, probably...
(LAUGHS)

33:46.880 --> 33:47.880
..the whole time.

33:47.880 --> 33:50.200
Yeah, I love it.
Yeah.
So cute.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.800
But I'm always curious, because...
Mmm.

33:51.800 --> 33:52.880
Like, you're really hot.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.640
Obviously, you're really handsome.
Do you think?

33:54.640 --> 33:56.560
Yeah. Are you fishing?
Nice that you said that about me.

33:56.560 --> 33:57.920
(LAUGHS)
No.

33:57.920 --> 33:58.920
No, you are.
Mmm.

33:58.920 --> 34:00.880
You're really handsome.
Oh, thank you.
You're gorgeous.

34:00.880 --> 34:05.920
But what is
this beautiful, fit, handsome...
Mmm.

34:05.920 --> 34:11.200
..athlete, like, why is he wanting
this, like, serious relationship?

34:11.200 --> 34:13.200
But that's, like...
Yeah.
..in the past now for me.

34:13.200 --> 34:14.200
Yeah?
Mmm.

34:14.200 --> 34:15.760
Like...
You've, like, moved on from it or...?

34:15.760 --> 34:17.440
Yeah. I'm...I'm totally moved on.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.160
For...for me, when I was swimming,

34:19.160 --> 34:21.240
I knew I wasn't ready
for a relationship.

34:21.240 --> 34:22.680
Really?
Mmm. So I've had kind of, like...

34:22.680 --> 34:24.720
So how do you know that
that's something that you want now?

34:24.720 --> 34:27.880
Like, I'm 29 -
I'm at a stage now where...

34:27.880 --> 34:31.080
..ready to...to share
some experiences with someone else,

34:31.080 --> 34:33.160
ready to, like,
settle down into a relationship.

34:33.160 --> 34:34.960
Like, I...I know what I want.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.920
KURT: I'm at the stage of my life
where I've got

34:36.920 --> 34:40.040
ambitions of...of wanting a family
in the future, and...

34:40.040 --> 34:41.520
..you know,
I feel like I'm at a point now

34:41.520 --> 34:43.920
where I want to share
those experiences with someone.

34:43.920 --> 34:46.280
I like a lot of the things
that you stand for.

34:46.280 --> 34:49.800
I think I've always
kind of felt that attraction to Kurt,

34:49.800 --> 34:53.560
but tonight, it feels more intense.

34:53.560 --> 34:55.240
You seem really passionate
about what you do.

34:55.240 --> 34:59.160
You seem fun, adventurous,
energetic, little bit cheeky.

34:59.160 --> 35:03.480
BROOKE: He's just chatting away and
I'm just in the clouds being, like,

35:03.480 --> 35:04.760
"I just want to kiss."

35:04.760 --> 35:07.760
Like the way you carry yourself
and the way you treat other people

35:07.760 --> 35:10.280
and the way
that you're always smiling.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.440
I like a girl who's always smiling.
Oh.

35:12.440 --> 35:14.480
In this moment, I'm not even
thinking about what he's saying.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.600
I'm, like, "Kiss me." (LAUGHS)

35:16.600 --> 35:19.000
Hello. Hi.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.040
(LAUGHS)

35:20.040 --> 35:22.240
Like, yeah, you're just, um...

35:22.240 --> 35:24.920
..everything so far
that I'm looking for.

35:24.920 --> 35:29.400
I have given this man enough looks
to be, like,

35:29.400 --> 35:31.720
"Hey. Would love a kiss."

35:31.720 --> 35:33.600
(MUFFLES BURP)

35:33.600 --> 35:35.320
Sorry, just burping.

35:35.320 --> 35:37.320
Sorry, just got to burp.

35:37.320 --> 35:40.480
(LAUGHS)

35:40.480 --> 35:43.080
Trying to hold it in...
You ruined my moment.
..but there's too much coming up.

35:43.080 --> 35:46.760
I feel like he still didn't know
what was happening.

35:46.760 --> 35:48.480
Think it's so cute!

35:48.480 --> 35:49.680
(LAUGHS)

35:49.680 --> 35:52.080
Um...what was I saying?

35:52.080 --> 35:54.240
You distract me, Brooke.

35:54.240 --> 35:58.000
I know what I want
and when I want it,

35:58.000 --> 36:01.960
but if we were going on Kurt's time,
I don't think we would get there,

36:01.960 --> 36:05.080
so I totally was going for it.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.640
Give the girl what she wants.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.720
Like, what do you look for in a guy?
Like...what...

36:09.720 --> 36:11.600
I'd like a kiss right now, but...
Yeah?

36:11.600 --> 36:13.000
(LAUGHS)
Do you want a kiss?

36:13.000 --> 36:14.760
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

36:14.760 --> 36:16.160
(LAUGHS)

36:16.160 --> 36:19.000
Oh, yeah. Um...we can kiss.

36:24.840 --> 36:27.880
BROOKE: I finally get to kiss him,

36:27.880 --> 36:32.440
and he knows how to kiss a woman.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.640
I want to spend this date, like,
just kissing you the whole time...

36:34.640 --> 36:35.720
Mmm.
..if I could.

36:35.720 --> 36:38.440
Yeah.
Anyway. I, um...

36:38.440 --> 36:41.480
BROOKE: I didn't expect to have
such a strong connection with him.

36:41.480 --> 36:45.520
I feel like
he's really opened up in this chat.

36:45.520 --> 36:51.320
He's a really wholesome guy, like,
a really all-rounded good person.

36:54.360 --> 36:57.040
I would like to get to know you more.
Mmm.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.120
So...
(SIGHS)

36:59.120 --> 37:01.360
(SINGS)

37:01.360 --> 37:02.640
Oh, no way.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.560
So, Kurt...
Mmm.

37:05.560 --> 37:07.240
..will you accept this rose?

37:07.240 --> 37:09.040
Yeah, I'd love to.
Beautiful.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.680
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.360
(BOTH LAUGH)

37:14.360 --> 37:16.240
KURT: I'm feeling on cloud nine.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.400
I just get a good feeling
around her.

37:18.400 --> 37:21.040
You know, it's the first time
we've ever really had time together,

37:21.040 --> 37:22.800
but I could almost see myself

37:22.800 --> 37:24.960
falling for her pretty hard
pretty soon.

37:24.960 --> 37:26.760
I'm just stoked
I got the rose, and...

37:26.760 --> 37:28.400
..I don't think
I'll be sleeping much tonight.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.640
I might go home and do a gym workout
or something or...

37:30.640 --> 37:32.680
..run off some of this wild energy.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.880
Thanks for the rose.
That's alright.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.680
Thank you for my date.
Thank you for being you.

37:37.680 --> 37:40.280
Keep being you.
Yeah.

37:40.280 --> 37:42.280
Let's go right to the end.

37:42.280 --> 37:44.640
Really?
Yeah.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.200
I like your hair.
Thank you very much.

37:55.200 --> 37:58.640
Yeah. It's got a little zhoosh.
You know, a little...

37:58.640 --> 38:00.200
Love it.
Yeah. You know.

38:00.200 --> 38:03.520
I got a pretty lady to impress.
I got to try my hardest, you know.

38:03.520 --> 38:04.840
So...
You don't have to impress me.

38:04.840 --> 38:07.920
(LAUGHTER)

38:09.880 --> 38:13.440
HOLLY: Coming into this cocktail
party, the mood's a bit of a mix.

38:13.440 --> 38:18.840
Some people are top of the world,
having a great time, quite relaxed.

38:18.840 --> 38:20.200
In a short amount of time,

38:20.200 --> 38:22.760
I feel like I've had a long amount
of time with Brooke, so...

38:22.760 --> 38:24.000
..I feel like I'm in a good spot.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.440
And I think a few people
are a bit stressed.

38:26.440 --> 38:27.960
So, what's...what's going on?
How you going?

38:27.960 --> 38:31.000
For me, it just feels like
I haven't spoke to her in a while.
Yeah.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.920
And it's kind of hard to sometime...
sometimes know where you stand,

38:33.920 --> 38:36.640
because you have these
great connections with Brooke,

38:36.640 --> 38:39.560
or these...you know,
these great moments with her,

38:39.560 --> 38:42.360
and then you come back and then
you hear about everyone else's dates

38:42.360 --> 38:44.800
or, you know, extended time,

38:44.800 --> 38:46.840
and you're, like,
"OK, well, where do I stand in that?"

38:46.840 --> 38:48.840
And you just really don't know
where Brooke stands

38:48.840 --> 38:51.840
and, you know,
who she's the most drawn to.

38:51.840 --> 38:53.720
Like, as soon as you start
comparing yourself to others,

38:53.720 --> 38:54.840
you're just losing.

38:54.840 --> 38:56.520
Like...
Yeah.
..like...

38:56.520 --> 38:57.880
I don't feel like
it's a comparing thing,

38:57.880 --> 38:59.520
but it's more just, like...

38:59.520 --> 39:01.040
..you're wondering, like...

39:01.040 --> 39:04.200
Oh, you're always...
..how your connection is.

39:04.200 --> 39:06.400
Yeah.
Yeah. I don't know.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.480
Feel like a lot of cocktail parties,
I've just kind of sat back,

39:08.480 --> 39:10.240
had a laugh, had a drink, had fun,

39:10.240 --> 39:13.600
whereas tonight, it's, like,
I really would like to talk to her.

39:13.600 --> 39:16.520
And that's my goal for tonight.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.880
CARISSA: I feel a little uncertain
about my connection with Brooke.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.360
I haven't spoke to her
in over a week.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.920
And I'm not sure
my connection with Brooke

39:23.920 --> 39:26.720
will be able to develop
in this situation.

39:28.600 --> 39:32.200
The energy that Carissa has
brought in tonight is very much...

39:32.200 --> 39:35.000
..different
from last cocktail parties...

39:35.000 --> 39:36.880
Yeah.
..that we've had.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.760
This is the first time
I've ever seen Carissa anxious...

39:38.760 --> 39:41.080
Yeah.
Yeah.
..at a cocktail party.

39:41.080 --> 39:43.720
DARVID: She's been really calm
the whole time...

39:43.720 --> 39:45.160
Mm-hm.
..until right now.
Tonight.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.640
Like, it must be something serious.

39:46.640 --> 39:49.240
HOLLY: Carissa has a
different energy about her tonight.

39:49.240 --> 39:53.480
You know, she's usually
super-cool, calm, collected.

39:53.480 --> 39:55.880
I hope that I can
have a chat with her.

39:55.880 --> 39:58.000
Just go grab her.
"Hey, can I steal you for a minute?"

39:58.000 --> 40:00.760
And tonight,
I feel like she's a bit anxious.

40:02.360 --> 40:04.800
Well! Look who it is.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.040
Oh! Hello, stunner.
Hello.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.560
MEN: Whoa!
WOMAN: Wow!

40:09.560 --> 40:13.200
Oh, hello!
Hello! How are you?

40:15.120 --> 40:16.960
Do you reckon
I could steal you for a chat?

40:16.960 --> 40:18.560
Yes.

40:18.560 --> 40:22.080
I did feel a connection there
from the moment we first met.

40:22.080 --> 40:26.560
I don't think that we've had enough
of an opportunity to build on that.

40:26.560 --> 40:29.800
It's really hard to be vulnerable,
especially in an environment

40:29.800 --> 40:33.560
where there's so many people
dating the same person.

40:34.680 --> 40:38.720
Like, I don't even know
where we stand anymore.

40:38.720 --> 40:40.560
It's just hard to, like,
be in the moment

40:40.560 --> 40:42.160
and just, like, have fun and, like,

40:42.160 --> 40:44.200
when I'm just, like,
have this thing in my mind

40:44.200 --> 40:47.200
that I just really
want to speak to her about.

40:47.200 --> 40:49.560
Guys, literally, like, I'm shaking.

40:49.560 --> 40:51.760
I just really need
to get this off my chest.

40:51.760 --> 40:56.160
CARISSA: I want to
just convey to her how I'm feeling.

41:06.880 --> 41:08.480
I didn't mean
to be so forceful tonight.

41:08.480 --> 41:09.800
There's just something that

41:09.800 --> 41:11.920
I really want to talk to you about.

41:11.920 --> 41:13.560
So I really want to steal you.

41:13.560 --> 41:15.760
BROOKE:
I'm enjoying my chat with Darvid

41:15.760 --> 41:19.480
and then Carissa interrupts the chat.

41:19.480 --> 41:21.000
This is very unlike her.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.680
Like, she's never really come up
to me at these cocktail parties.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.320
She's kind of, like,
always held back.

41:26.320 --> 41:29.280
But today it seems like she's...

41:30.400 --> 41:32.360
..anxious about something,

41:32.360 --> 41:35.120
like she needs
to get it off her chest.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.920
CARISSA:
I'm very keen to chat to Brooke.

41:37.920 --> 41:39.880
I'm nervous for sure.
I don't know how it's gonna go.

41:39.880 --> 41:42.320
But I need to share with Brooke.

41:43.320 --> 41:46.600
You OK? What's going on?
OK, let's hold hands.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.640
Um, so...

41:48.640 --> 41:50.720
..I think
love is such a beautiful thing.

41:50.720 --> 41:53.560
And when I first met you
on the red carpet,

41:53.560 --> 41:57.280
feeling that instant spark
with you and...

41:57.280 --> 42:00.000
..you know, I think
that when we had that extra time,

42:00.000 --> 42:01.480
I really enjoyed our conversation.

42:01.480 --> 42:04.520
I know it got
quite deep and emotional, but...

42:04.520 --> 42:06.760
..the next morning, you know,
seeing you go on a single date

42:06.760 --> 42:09.600
and then hearing
these intense connections that...

42:09.600 --> 42:13.280
..people are forming with you,
just so powerful, and...

42:13.280 --> 42:17.160
..I know that I'm just hearing the
one side, I don't know how YOU feel.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.720
Guess I just don't know
if I can do this.

42:18.720 --> 42:22.880
Hearing Carissa say all this,
it just makes me sad.

42:24.240 --> 42:26.000
I can totally...

42:26.000 --> 42:28.600
..can understand, like,
and resonate with that feeling.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.480
Yeah.
It's awkward, right?

42:30.480 --> 42:35.760
It's a very un...
like, it's a very unusual feeling.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.640
Obviously, I've never been
in this environment before,

42:37.640 --> 42:39.440
and it's just really hard
to fully let your walls down,

42:39.440 --> 42:42.520
and it's just hard for me.

42:45.400 --> 42:47.600
I just can't fall in love this way.

42:49.280 --> 42:52.240
I can't do it like this.

42:52.240 --> 42:54.000
(SIGHS)

42:54.000 --> 42:55.400
BROOKE:
I don't really have words for it.

42:57.920 --> 43:00.360
(SIGHS) It's just hard.

43:00.360 --> 43:03.040
But it's what she needs to do.

43:03.040 --> 43:06.800
I did honestly think
that we had a lot of potential,

43:06.800 --> 43:08.520
and I really wanted
to get to know you.

43:10.640 --> 43:13.600
I think you are
a really beautiful person.

43:13.600 --> 43:16.760
You are really special.

43:16.760 --> 43:20.080
And from the red carpet,
I had this amazing impression of you.

43:20.080 --> 43:22.280
Yeah.
Like, you blew me away.

43:22.280 --> 43:25.160
I am really happy
with our connection.

43:25.160 --> 43:27.480
But if it's not for you,
and this environment is not for you,

43:27.480 --> 43:29.440
I can't force you to be here.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.760
Like...
I'm sorry.

43:35.160 --> 43:36.720
I didn't see this coming.

43:37.840 --> 43:39.400
Please just know
that I...I didn't...

43:39.400 --> 43:40.880
It's fine.
..I'm sorry.

43:40.880 --> 43:43.280
I'm just...it's hard, Brooke.

43:44.720 --> 43:48.480
I honestly thought
we had something special.

43:48.480 --> 43:50.240
Alright.

43:50.240 --> 43:51.880
(SIGHS)

43:54.000 --> 43:56.680
And it's got me thinking,
if I can be so off with Carissa,

43:56.680 --> 43:59.640
who else am I misreading?

44:00.960 --> 44:03.280
Does anyone know
where Brooke and Carissa are?

44:03.280 --> 44:05.560
They've been in there
for a long time!

44:05.560 --> 44:08.040
I noticed that Brooke's
been gone for a while with Carissa.

44:08.040 --> 44:11.480
(SIGHS) It seems like they're
having a very, very long chat.

44:11.480 --> 44:13.720
Oh, wait, wait.
Here comes Brooke. There's Brooke.

44:13.720 --> 44:15.920
Yay.
There she is.
Here she comes.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.920
You OK?
You right?

44:17.920 --> 44:18.920
You good?

44:18.920 --> 44:22.040
Brooke comes out in the backyard
and she does not look happy.

44:22.040 --> 44:24.120
Oh, she's back without Carissa.
Carissa.

44:24.120 --> 44:25.840
Where IS Carissa?
Has Carissa left?

44:25.840 --> 44:27.200
Carissa's left.
I don't know.

44:27.200 --> 44:30.200
I think Carissa's just left.

44:30.200 --> 44:32.160
As soon as I saw her walk back in,
I knew something was wrong,

44:32.160 --> 44:33.680
something was up.

44:33.680 --> 44:37.280
So I've just put Carissa in a car
and she's just gone home.

44:37.280 --> 44:42.000
She's just told me that she can't
fall in love in this environment.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.480
So, yeah,
I'm a little bit upset by it.

44:45.480 --> 44:48.920
HOLLY: I think
Carissa leaving shows that...

44:48.920 --> 44:50.560
..she's been true to herself

44:50.560 --> 44:52.880
and she's not just hanging round
to hang around,

44:52.880 --> 44:56.640
but it must be hard for Brooke
being so open with everyone

44:56.640 --> 44:58.520
and then having it not returned.

44:58.520 --> 45:00.400
Like, it...it's hard.

45:00.400 --> 45:03.360
BROOKE: So... (SIGHS)
..there's a lot to process there.

45:03.360 --> 45:06.480
And, um...

45:06.480 --> 45:08.480
..I'm gonna call it tonight,

45:08.480 --> 45:11.440
if you guys can just accept that.

45:11.440 --> 45:13.080
Yeah, that's OK.
Yeah.
It's all good.

45:13.080 --> 45:14.560
No worries.
I hope you're alright.

45:14.560 --> 45:19.680
You want to fall in love,
and you want Brooke to fall in love.

45:19.680 --> 45:22.000
No worries.
Yeah, I hope you're alright.
Thanks.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.520
See ya, Brooke.
See ya, everybody. Bye.

45:25.520 --> 45:28.800
That's big.
Wow.

45:28.800 --> 45:31.160
Wow. She left.
Yeah.

45:31.160 --> 45:32.400
I did not expect that.

45:32.400 --> 45:34.960
Wow, I'm just shocked.
Yep.

45:34.960 --> 45:37.240
I feel for Brooke right now.
She's clearly upset.

45:37.240 --> 45:39.760
She had a connection with Carissa.

45:39.760 --> 45:43.680
And, yeah,
she's been let...let down.

45:43.680 --> 45:47.720
Her heart is obviously on the line.
She's here for a real reason.

45:47.720 --> 45:51.000
If anyone's wasting her time
right now, like...

45:51.000 --> 45:52.840
..there's the front door.

45:54.640 --> 45:57.480
OSHER:
Tomorrow on The Bachelorette...

45:58.480 --> 46:00.680
JAMIE-LEE: Are you gonna make me
jump off something?

46:00.680 --> 46:02.840
(BOTH LAUGH)
Anything for love.

46:02.840 --> 46:04.760
Hello, Brooke. Jamie-Lee.

46:04.760 --> 46:07.600
What are you gonna do, Osher?
What have you got planned?

46:07.600 --> 46:09.440
..a skyscraper date...

46:09.440 --> 46:10.880
Hell, yeah, I'm in!
(BOTH LAUGH)

46:10.880 --> 46:14.040
..leaves Jamie-Lee
feeling on top of the world...

46:14.040 --> 46:16.360
Hell, yeah, babe!
Whoo!
Yeah, we did!

46:16.360 --> 46:19.680
We are now
exactly where I'd hoped we'd be.

46:19.680 --> 46:22.520
..before a human lie detector...

46:22.520 --> 46:24.160
KURT:
Steven asked if there was someone

46:24.160 --> 46:25.680
not here for the right reasons.

46:25.680 --> 46:28.200
I'm gonna tell him
the open and honest truth.

46:28.200 --> 46:31.760
There is a level of deceit
that's, uh, taking place.

46:31.760 --> 46:34.040
BROOKE: I just can't help
but have my guard up.

46:34.040 --> 46:37.320
..one of my strongest connections,
hits hard.

46:37.320 --> 46:39.480
..sees it all come crashing down.

46:39.480 --> 46:41.640
I took you on a single date,
I felt really good about it,

46:41.640 --> 46:45.360
but now I'm, like...
why wouldn't you tell me about this?

46:45.360 --> 46:47.600
Where has this come from?
I don't know.

46:47.600 --> 46:49.360
JAMIE-LEE: I was on cloud nine.

46:49.360 --> 46:51.800
And now I just feel like
this is what could

46:51.800 --> 46:54.040
potentially affect
my chance with Brooke.

46:54.040 --> 46:55.840
I want you to believe me!

46:55.840 --> 46:57.840
