WEBVTT

00:02.013 --> 00:03.382
Before we start,

00:03.507 --> 00:05.538
I'd like to have
a preliminary powwow,

00:05.663 --> 00:08.455
or prelimi-wow,
about what I'm calling

00:08.580 --> 00:10.343
our library's backdoor conundrum.

00:10.834 --> 00:12.779
Sounds like a porno
with Kate Winslet.

00:14.487 --> 00:16.411
The door on that side
is locked after 5:00,

00:16.536 --> 00:18.893
so, we have to walk
all the way around.

00:19.061 --> 00:21.479
If we were to move
our meetings to 4:30...

00:24.244 --> 00:26.401
I have a regular class at that time.

00:26.569 --> 00:28.903
It's like math
or other regular classes.

00:29.071 --> 00:31.531
I have something unimportant
that can't ever move.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.826
One of us could stand by the door
and let the rest in?

00:35.274 --> 00:36.953
- I nominate Pierce.
- Where is he?

00:37.121 --> 00:38.788
I have not seen him around all day.

00:39.364 --> 00:40.498
I haven't either.

00:41.751 --> 00:44.125
- Has anyone called him?
- I did. Several times, actually

00:44.250 --> 00:45.845
but he never returned my calls.

00:47.932 --> 00:49.756
The last thing I told him
was "suck it".

00:49.926 --> 00:51.468
- Me too.
- Good morning.

00:53.346 --> 00:54.304
Thank God.

00:55.512 --> 00:57.365
You thought I was dead, didn't you?

00:57.490 --> 00:58.558
- No.
- I did.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.894
You have any idea
how emasculating that is?

01:01.660 --> 01:04.906
I'm not Mickey Rooney. Don't cross
your fingers to see if I'll come.

01:05.031 --> 01:08.735
When I was 30, people used to wish
that I was dead to my face!

01:09.192 --> 01:10.403
That's called respect.

01:12.244 --> 01:13.998
Who is the lucky brunette?

01:14.123 --> 01:16.444
Last name Beeswax,
first name None-a-ya.

01:16.569 --> 01:18.272
My third wife was biracial.

01:19.399 --> 01:21.164
- Stop it!
- I am trying to help you

01:21.332 --> 01:24.106
to keep you out of trouble,
what if the next girl saw these?

01:24.231 --> 01:25.934
Then she would know it's hers!

01:27.809 --> 01:29.881
You slept with the same woman twice?

01:30.049 --> 01:33.443
Can't I be the friend whose trademark
is his defined boundaries,

01:33.568 --> 01:37.347
like, Privacy Smurf, Discreet Bear,
or Confidenciality Space?

01:37.515 --> 01:39.852
If you like her,
why would you wanna keep her a secret?

01:39.977 --> 01:42.967
- Don't you want us to meet her?
- We agree to keep it low key.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.230
Ridiculous. Obviously it's a guy.

01:45.499 --> 01:46.492
You're wrong.

01:46.617 --> 01:47.755
It's two guys.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.776
Sometimes I do wish you were dead.

02:20.438 --> 02:21.688
Sorry I'm late.

02:33.784 --> 02:35.353
Professor Slater, quick question.

02:35.478 --> 02:37.534
You know the answer.
I don't date students,

02:37.659 --> 02:39.840
even if you are no longer
in my statistics class.

02:39.965 --> 02:42.417
I'm seeing someone right now,
thanks.

02:42.697 --> 02:45.447
- Really? How's that going?
- Fine. She's smart and pretty.

02:45.572 --> 02:49.280
Sometimes I feel she's waiting for me
to stop talking and take off my pants.

02:50.342 --> 02:51.342
She is.

02:55.290 --> 02:56.998
I've never been
someone's dirty secret.

02:57.123 --> 02:59.148
I've never had
a dirty little secret.

02:59.273 --> 03:00.630
It's so unprofessional.

03:00.755 --> 03:02.796
But the sneaking
does make the sex 38% hotter.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.926
You do like statistics, don't you?

03:08.939 --> 03:10.857
- Midterms and whatever.
- Chalk.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.906
There's that transcript you wanted.

03:13.031 --> 03:14.599
I didn't expect to see you here.

03:14.724 --> 03:16.946
Hopefully, I'm not... interrupting.

03:19.704 --> 03:21.254
You know, we laugh...

03:21.489 --> 03:24.118
but the fact is
student/teacher relationships do happen,

03:24.243 --> 03:27.081
and they are a magnet for lawsuits.
So we do stay vigilant.

03:27.249 --> 03:30.121
In fact, physically attractive
students and faculty

03:30.246 --> 03:32.211
are placed on a watch list

03:32.336 --> 03:34.922
and ranked by their potential
to incite fraternization.

03:35.090 --> 03:38.843
- You rank people by how hot they are?
- You got it... number two.

03:39.011 --> 03:41.471
- Dean Pelton.
- Yes, Pr Seven... Slater.

03:41.747 --> 03:43.431
I'll return this tomorrow.

03:44.596 --> 03:46.184
Be extra careful now.

03:46.618 --> 03:49.543
Two people of your rankings
in this small a room...

03:49.668 --> 03:53.232
with this type of lighting
and his upper body and what her heels

03:53.400 --> 03:54.984
and hemline are doing to enhance

03:55.152 --> 03:58.018
what were already
quite a few favors from God...

03:58.143 --> 04:00.947
It's all the more important
to keep it tasteful.

04:10.373 --> 04:12.210
- He might have ruined...
- It's dead.

04:19.510 --> 04:22.186
I can't wait for the recital.
You are wonderful,

04:22.311 --> 04:23.638
especially you, Troy.

04:24.069 --> 04:25.431
Thanks, madame Leclair.

04:26.930 --> 04:30.374
And if any of you mention
my dancing outside of class,

04:30.716 --> 04:33.648
I'll break off your legs and use them
to smash in your friends' cars.

04:46.517 --> 04:48.913
Since when have you
taken modern dance?

04:49.081 --> 04:51.571
6 months. Coach told me
it would help with my coordination,

04:51.696 --> 04:54.698
and I fell in love with it,
in a very straight way.

04:55.888 --> 04:57.271
It's tempting to sneak a peek,

04:57.396 --> 04:59.921
but I'm gonna need for you
to keep your eyes up here!

05:00.046 --> 05:02.472
I should haven't dismissed you
as a shallow jock.

05:02.597 --> 05:04.960
We haven't spent
that much time together.

05:05.085 --> 05:07.511
Because you don't play football
or have fun.

05:07.636 --> 05:10.524
I have fun tap-dancing.
I started last semester too.

05:10.649 --> 05:12.617
It was something
that I wanted to do,

05:12.742 --> 05:15.395
but it was too embarrassing,
so I never told anyone.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.520
Same here.

05:18.277 --> 05:21.070
- Nobody can know about this.
- Who are we kidding?

05:21.238 --> 05:23.403
Look at how much time
and energy we put

05:23.528 --> 05:26.784
to hide something which passionate us.
We are leading a double life.

05:27.315 --> 05:29.704
I'm spending a lot of money
on breakaway clothing.

05:30.028 --> 05:32.415
We should look at this
as an opportunity to come clean.

05:33.303 --> 05:35.084
Are you saying we tell the group?

05:35.252 --> 05:38.087
We could invite them
to the dance recital on Friday.

05:40.282 --> 05:41.215
I don't know.

05:42.005 --> 05:43.382
Let me think about it.

05:48.766 --> 05:49.807
Let's do this.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.559
Sorry.

05:54.563 --> 05:57.565
Would you come to my office?
We never finished our intercourse.

05:59.057 --> 06:00.494
I have study group right now,

06:00.619 --> 06:03.154
and nobody uses intercourse
to mean anything other than sex.

06:04.297 --> 06:07.200
This is a wall of windows.
My study group's behind it.

06:07.526 --> 06:08.526
I know.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.902
As soon as we touch,
the blinds will open,

06:11.027 --> 06:13.790
and six annoying but loveable misfits
will be staring at us.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.720
Come on, what are the odds?

06:17.531 --> 06:18.471
Fine.

06:26.090 --> 06:27.529
Was that so bad?

06:29.264 --> 06:31.451
Could you open the back door?

06:39.619 --> 06:42.985
You all remember Michelle Slater,
my professor from last semester?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.970
As most of you may realize by now,

06:46.311 --> 06:48.430
she's the woman
I've been seeing lately.

06:50.114 --> 06:51.910
Why are hey looking at me
like an animal?

06:52.078 --> 06:53.611
Jeff is like a dad to the group,

06:53.736 --> 06:55.706
so this is like being told
that you're our mom.

06:56.498 --> 06:58.470
You know it's nothing like that?

06:59.127 --> 07:02.411
Absolutely. Do you cook macaroni?
Macaroni's my favorite.

07:02.536 --> 07:05.374
The important thing is
we all understand

07:05.499 --> 07:09.133
Professor Slater and I
need this to be our little secret.

07:09.647 --> 07:11.236
Everyone understand that?

07:13.947 --> 07:14.947
Sure.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.728
See? All good.

07:18.530 --> 07:20.712
Thank you, everyone.
I appreciate it.

07:20.837 --> 07:22.232
I should get going.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.691
You've taken a big step
in knocking down the barriers

07:35.816 --> 07:37.593
between students and teachers...

07:38.283 --> 07:39.574
like Rosa Parks.

07:39.699 --> 07:41.543
- I don't think it's like that.
- It is.

07:41.911 --> 07:44.338
If you need to explain it,
it's not just like that.

07:46.269 --> 07:47.924
Is your heart gonna be okay?

07:48.094 --> 07:50.674
I will try to find
the tools to survive.

07:52.850 --> 07:54.708
Everybody, speaking of secrets,

07:54.833 --> 07:57.643
we have something
that we would like to announce.

07:59.186 --> 08:00.787
There's a dance recital on Friday.

08:00.912 --> 08:02.832
I would be honored if you'd attend,

08:02.957 --> 08:04.805
because since last semester...

08:06.621 --> 08:08.279
I have been taking a tap class.

08:10.917 --> 08:12.491
That's... funny.

08:13.037 --> 08:15.744
- I don't know how funny it is.
- Come on.

08:15.914 --> 08:17.647
We're not making fun of you.

08:17.772 --> 08:20.624
But obviously, you kept it a secret
'cause you saw the irony too.

08:20.794 --> 08:21.689
Irony?

08:21.814 --> 08:24.235
You're not typically
vulnerable or feminine,

08:24.360 --> 08:27.521
and the act of dancing is considered
vulnerable and feminine.

08:27.715 --> 08:30.342
I disagree. What about
Fred Astaire or Baryshnikov?

08:30.512 --> 08:32.135
Yeah, I guess.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.082
There are exceptions to the rule,

08:34.207 --> 08:36.971
but even when Jerry Rice
went on <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>...

08:38.107 --> 08:40.268
Oh, God. I liked him.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.116
What... What's your secret?

08:48.653 --> 08:49.753
My secret...

08:50.590 --> 08:51.723
Is that...

08:52.777 --> 08:54.282
I knew Britta's secret.

08:55.327 --> 08:58.496
I saw her in her dance outfit,
and she looked ridiculous.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.513
So I helped her protect her shame.

09:00.638 --> 09:02.424
I'm glad she's out now.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.829
There you are.

09:06.954 --> 09:09.631
Just got word of your relationship
with Professor Slater.

09:11.175 --> 09:13.593
I'd like to see you in my office
in half an hour.

09:14.485 --> 09:16.179
None of you left.
How is that possible?

09:16.349 --> 09:18.640
For one thing,
it's all over Twitter.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.469
Britta in a tutu...
Can you imagine?

09:27.636 --> 09:30.540
What the hell? We were supposed
to come out together.

09:31.906 --> 09:33.113
I changed my mind.

09:33.283 --> 09:35.616
They're gonna find out
that you dance at the recital.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.427
I'm not gonna be in the recital.

09:37.552 --> 09:38.959
I'm dropping the class.

09:39.084 --> 09:41.705
How can you do this?
I'm so disappointed in you.

09:41.873 --> 09:45.010
You don't get to talk to me like that.
You are not Shirley!

09:45.277 --> 09:46.793
And Shirley is not my mom.

09:47.714 --> 09:49.770
It's not like
we were in the same boat.

09:49.895 --> 09:51.538
Girls are supposed to dance.

09:51.663 --> 09:53.800
That's why God gave them
parts that jiggle.

09:54.189 --> 09:56.100
But I'd be going
from starting quarterback

09:56.225 --> 09:58.305
to a guy that twirls around
in tights.

09:58.430 --> 10:01.266
I've got more to lose on that stage
because I'm a man.

10:01.436 --> 10:02.383
Guess what?

10:02.508 --> 10:05.645
A real man doesn't bail
on his friends or on himself.

10:07.586 --> 10:10.400
You're a dancer, Troy.
It's who you are.

10:11.995 --> 10:13.205
Not anymore.

10:16.095 --> 10:17.074
Excuse me.

10:21.652 --> 10:22.894
Upset about Jeff?

10:23.339 --> 10:25.132
No. I am upset about...

10:26.714 --> 10:28.293
Something I can't talk about.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.914
We can talk about anything...

10:30.039 --> 10:32.071
Politics, medicine, Jeff.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.364
Did you hear
that the shroud of Turin...

10:35.489 --> 10:37.520
Here's the thing about Jeff.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.369
Chasing after you
made him a better person

10:40.494 --> 10:42.223
'cause you always
called him on his stuff.

10:42.348 --> 10:45.192
All this time, you've been warming
him up and stirring in sweetener

10:45.317 --> 10:48.188
and making him just right.
You weren't ready to take a sip yet,

10:48.358 --> 10:51.914
but it didn't mean you want him snatched
off the counter and guzzle down.

10:52.039 --> 10:53.953
Shirley, I did not warm Jeff up.

10:54.078 --> 10:55.695
Nobody ever will.

10:55.957 --> 10:58.698
Do you think professor Slater
is getting flowers right now?

10:59.129 --> 11:01.785
Do you think that they are gonna go
to the movies and hold hands,

11:01.955 --> 11:03.568
visit her parents?

11:04.455 --> 11:07.094
The only thing keeping them going
was the thrill of the secrecy,

11:07.219 --> 11:10.043
and now that it is out,
it is over, believe me.

11:12.266 --> 11:15.325
Can I just ask
as a divorced black housewife...

11:15.707 --> 11:18.802
What part of being a single white
slacker makes you people so jaded?

11:19.797 --> 11:20.792
You people?

11:21.180 --> 11:22.848
What do you mean, you people?

11:23.315 --> 11:25.138
I cannot believe I got to say that.

11:25.263 --> 11:27.280
It's the little things, isn't it?

11:28.216 --> 11:30.407
Now that your secret is out there,

11:30.532 --> 11:33.650
I'm gonna talk you through
this teacher/student relationship form,

11:33.921 --> 11:35.986
we can get you two
on your very attractive way.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.139
We haven't even admitted
to being a couple.

11:38.264 --> 11:40.824
In fact, this is all based on hearsay,
worse than hearsay...

11:40.994 --> 11:42.367
Pierce's Twitter account,

11:42.535 --> 11:45.996
in which he says he's 47 and teaches
a women's-only Pilates class.

11:46.492 --> 11:48.226
Jeff, it's okay. It's out.

11:48.660 --> 11:51.251
And you know what?
It doesn't bother me. I'm happy.

11:51.421 --> 11:52.252
Sweet.

11:54.637 --> 11:57.215
First question.
"How long have you been doing it?"

11:58.914 --> 12:01.386
Not it. I mean this... dating.

12:01.755 --> 12:02.801
A few weeks.

12:03.970 --> 12:06.725
And...
How long have you been doing it?

12:07.480 --> 12:09.430
We don't have to answer that.

12:10.384 --> 12:11.146
Now...

12:12.097 --> 12:13.750
This is just hypothetical.

12:14.055 --> 12:16.693
Might you ever consider
spending the night with a third person?

12:16.961 --> 12:18.344
That's not on there!

12:20.683 --> 12:21.656
It's on there.

12:21.781 --> 12:24.152
Just exploring your options,
obviously.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.245
No agenda.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.478
I'll put "TBD".

12:28.492 --> 12:30.832
Would you describe yourself
as boyfriend and girlfriend?

12:32.670 --> 12:34.461
- What?
- Oh, boy.

12:34.732 --> 12:36.796
It's semantics, really, isn't it?

12:37.966 --> 12:40.767
We've slept together every night
for the last three weeks.

12:40.892 --> 12:43.767
- How would you describe me?
- The best friend ever.

12:47.554 --> 12:49.435
I guess
I've had the wrong idea about us.

12:50.086 --> 12:51.186
This is good.

12:51.366 --> 12:53.304
I'd be better off dating...

12:54.156 --> 12:56.024
an adult.
See you around

13:02.439 --> 13:03.823
I'll get the break-up form.

13:11.287 --> 13:13.444
I got freaked out
by that boyfriend label.

13:14.626 --> 13:15.458
I'm...

13:15.885 --> 13:17.004
afraid of commitment.

13:17.341 --> 13:20.006
- How original.
- The biggest truths aren't original.

13:20.486 --> 13:21.967
Truth is ketchup.

13:22.314 --> 13:23.385
It's Jim Belushi.

13:23.685 --> 13:25.478
Its job isn't to blow our minds.

13:25.603 --> 13:28.009
It's to be within reach,
so the truth is...

13:28.243 --> 13:30.270
I get claustrophobic
when things get official.

13:30.395 --> 13:32.251
You're acting
like I'm a Venus flytrap.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.804
I didn't want or need
more than what we were doing.

13:34.929 --> 13:36.921
Let's get back to it.
Should I get the door?

13:37.046 --> 13:38.923
I can't,
you went to the friend place.

13:39.048 --> 13:40.961
That's you getting official, not me,

13:41.086 --> 13:42.738
unless there's something
I need to know

13:42.906 --> 13:44.820
about the lunch lady or that blonde

13:44.945 --> 13:47.290
with the infinite supply
of leather jackets,

13:47.415 --> 13:49.533
somewhere between our 9th and 11th
slumber party,

13:49.658 --> 13:52.456
statistically speaking, most people
would call us more than pals.

13:52.624 --> 13:55.876
Yeah, but soon as you say it,
it can get complicated and messy.

13:56.325 --> 13:58.200
- How?
- Because when you say it,

13:58.325 --> 14:00.172
later on,
you might have to un-say it.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.049
Whoopee flippin' ding, winger.
It happens 50 million times a day.

14:03.599 --> 14:05.825
It's the Jim Belushi
of sexual commitments.

14:05.950 --> 14:08.764
It barely means anything,
and it grows on what's there over time.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.558
Boy, that guy's really taking a pounding
in this conversation.

14:12.830 --> 14:14.269
I'll see you around.

14:23.510 --> 14:26.323
I really liked what we were doing.
And if the ratio

14:26.491 --> 14:29.066
of work to pleasure
can really stay at that same level,

14:29.191 --> 14:31.574
I don't care what it's called.
I'll do it.

14:32.096 --> 14:33.195
Let's do it.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.087
That's a big crowd out there.

14:59.212 --> 15:01.538
Abed's really good
at inviting people.

15:01.676 --> 15:04.444
We're all here to support you.
Jeff even brought his girlfriend.

15:04.771 --> 15:08.156
She's his girlfriend now?
Can't wait till he hears about it.

15:08.740 --> 15:11.209
He knows. They even had
to file paperwork with the dean.

15:11.334 --> 15:12.849
It's pretty serious.

15:12.974 --> 15:14.623
Our little Jeff's growing up!

15:18.704 --> 15:19.960
Break a leg, Britta.

15:21.107 --> 15:23.632
I have no idea how someone
could do what you're about to do.

15:28.144 --> 15:30.220
I brought goobers.
Anybody want a goober?

15:30.388 --> 15:31.805
Get them while they're gooby!

15:38.762 --> 15:40.355
Well, this is already ridiculous.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.239
<i>Tea for two</i> ?
There...

15:46.711 --> 15:48.141
There're five people.

15:54.900 --> 15:55.972
Good lord.

16:00.315 --> 16:02.002
Is she a water pot or a tea kettle?

16:09.657 --> 16:11.895
Don't you think the flowers
are dying from the tea?

16:13.316 --> 16:14.844
Everyone can hear you.

16:42.642 --> 16:43.460
Water it!

16:44.493 --> 16:46.963
- What's going on?
- So embarrassing.

16:55.896 --> 16:56.998
Plot twist.

16:58.757 --> 17:00.936
Easy, girl. There we go.

17:07.016 --> 17:08.233
Play something modern.

17:09.548 --> 17:10.954
What are you doing here?

17:11.079 --> 17:12.739
Being a friend and a man.

17:34.413 --> 17:35.304
It's OK.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.221
Culturally, it's unacceptable,

17:40.542 --> 17:42.352
but it's theatrical dynamite!

17:57.619 --> 17:58.827
Yeah, all right!

17:59.212 --> 18:00.232
Bring it!

18:01.872 --> 18:02.915
Greendale!

18:07.227 --> 18:09.829
Hi, guys. That was really cool.
I wish I knew how to tap-dance.

18:11.219 --> 18:13.967
It takes a lot of hard work,
but you could always take a class.

18:14.092 --> 18:14.900
Pass.

18:18.656 --> 18:20.932
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.514
You looked so pathetic,

18:22.639 --> 18:25.052
you made going up there
the most masculine option.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.815
What you did up there really took guts.
I'm impressed.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.275
Thanks, Pierce.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.264
And such a creative way
to tell the world you're gay.

18:41.831 --> 18:43.178
Good job up there.

18:43.775 --> 18:46.249
Where's your date?
Didn't she want to get my autograph?

18:46.625 --> 18:49.502
She's getting a permission slip
to allow us to drive home together.

18:50.055 --> 18:51.660
I heard you are official now.

18:51.785 --> 18:52.996
Yeah, I guess.

18:53.172 --> 18:54.883
You actually had a big part in that.

18:55.176 --> 18:57.857
If I can handle
having a girl for a friend,

18:57.982 --> 19:00.185
who's to say
I'm not ready for a girlfriend?

19:00.685 --> 19:02.640
Makes perfect sense. Break a leg.

19:07.013 --> 19:07.869
Flowers.

19:07.994 --> 19:09.814
Yeah. That's what people do, right?

19:10.213 --> 19:13.126
I was gonna throw them up on stage,
but I thought they might catch fire.

19:13.251 --> 19:14.970
No, this is... This is good.

19:15.095 --> 19:16.697
You can hand them to me. Thank you.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.238
See you Monday.

19:48.900 --> 19:50.314
Good night, everybody.

19:52.794 --> 19:54.892
- Five letters... Broadway musical.
- Annie.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.681
- Six letters... To puncture.
- Pierce.

19:58.554 --> 20:00.886
- A water filter that starts with "B".
- Brita.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.220
Here's a tough one, though.
Helen of...

20:04.345 --> 20:05.169
Troy.

20:05.588 --> 20:08.591
Damn, you're good.
I never even heard of that last one.

20:08.716 --> 20:11.501
One of the two brother actors.
Bridges. Four letters.

20:14.080 --> 20:14.924
I know.

20:15.147 --> 20:16.482
- Bridges.
- I don't know.

20:16.607 --> 20:18.665
Come on, guys.
Can't you see the pattern there?

20:18.790 --> 20:21.261
Can you see it?
It's Beau... Beau Bridges!

20:21.748 --> 20:23.810
These are all things
you can see on TV...

20:24.326 --> 20:26.348
Except for Pierce...
That's a misdirect.

20:27.724 --> 20:30.445
- I love misdirects.
- I love <i>The Big Lebowski</i>.
