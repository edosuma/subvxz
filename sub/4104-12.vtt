WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.354
<i>Previously on</i> The 100...

00:03.521 --> 00:05.523
Bellamy, don't do this!

00:07.400 --> 00:09.777
- He deserves to die!
- No!

00:09.943 --> 00:12.530
We don't decide who lives and dies!

00:12.697 --> 00:14.978
<i>The Exodus ship is still tied in
to all our major systems!</i>

00:15.033 --> 00:16.618
If it launches,
the Ark will be crippled

00:16.784 --> 00:19.120
- and everyone left onboard will die!
- Launch!

00:25.209 --> 00:27.545
You started a war that you
don't know how to end.

00:27.712 --> 00:29.432
You have no idea
what your people have done.

00:29.464 --> 00:32.800
- We had to stop the attack.
- You stopped nothing.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.177
Clarke, come on!

00:35.511 --> 00:36.554
Clarke!

00:38.640 --> 00:42.727
- Take him away, and kill him.
- No! No! No!

00:42.894 --> 00:43.895
No!

00:47.106 --> 00:49.692
<i>Every simulation has been run.</i>

00:49.859 --> 00:53.863
<i>Every system modification
has been made.</i>

00:55.740 --> 00:59.702
The hard and simple fact
is that in 51 hours,

00:59.869 --> 01:01.496
life on the Ark...

01:02.914 --> 01:05.500
...will no longer be possible.

01:07.210 --> 01:12.131
I choose to find consolation
in one remarkable truth.

01:12.799 --> 01:15.176
The surviving members of the hundred

01:15.343 --> 01:18.054
have proven themselves
to be more resilient

01:18.221 --> 01:19.764
than we could have ever imagined.

01:20.723 --> 01:23.893
Our legacy will go on.

01:24.310 --> 01:26.104
And for that...

01:28.523 --> 01:30.566
...I am not only grateful...

01:32.443 --> 01:34.070
...but I am proud.

01:35.113 --> 01:37.115
So what do we
tell our constituents to do now?

01:38.616 --> 01:39.909
What do we do now?

01:47.458 --> 01:49.210
Look inside.

01:51.421 --> 01:53.005
Find your peace.

01:58.136 --> 01:59.512
In the meantime,

01:59.679 --> 02:04.016
I'm releasing all available resources
to the surviving citizens of the Ark.

02:04.475 --> 02:06.644
There will be no more rationing.

02:06.978 --> 02:09.731
What we have belongs to all of us.

02:26.914 --> 02:30.334
- Are you all right, Abby?
- Yes.

02:32.503 --> 02:35.798
I have a patient, she was...
hurt in the bomb blast.

02:35.965 --> 02:37.508
I need to go.

02:42.597 --> 02:47.018
Sir, is it wise to waste rations
when we don't know for sure?

02:48.186 --> 02:50.563
But we do know for sure.

02:51.314 --> 02:54.942
I can't just do nothing.

02:56.152 --> 02:58.821
- I need to find a solution.
- Wait.

02:58.988 --> 03:01.032
I know this is hard to accept.

03:01.199 --> 03:03.451
But if you'd like to spend
your remaining time

03:03.618 --> 03:08.831
re-running simulations,
by all means, you can do that.

03:09.707 --> 03:14.545
I, however,
will be spending my time...

03:15.379 --> 03:19.300
...with family and
a bottle of 97-year-old scotch.

03:41.197 --> 03:44.826
<i>Come on. These foxholes
aren't gonna build themselves.</i>

03:48.246 --> 03:49.914
Better hope those landmines work.

03:50.081 --> 03:53.084
All the gunpowder we're wasting,
we could be making more grenades.

03:53.251 --> 03:55.419
You wanna come over here
and test one?

03:55.586 --> 03:58.339
Cute. I need this entire section
mined by morning.

03:58.506 --> 04:01.133
- Then we'll finish the south field.
- Hey!

04:02.718 --> 04:04.988
I told you, we're going after
Finn, Clarke and Monty in the morning.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.223
And I told you,
nobody leaves this camp.

04:07.390 --> 04:10.726
I'm talking to you!
We can't just abandon our people!

04:11.853 --> 04:14.772
You wanna lead them,
show them you give a damn.

04:16.148 --> 04:18.651
<i>- What the hell was that?
- What are you shooting at?</i>

04:18.817 --> 04:20.444
<i>- Hey!
- I can't see anything!</i>

04:21.737 --> 04:23.131
What the hell's the matter with you?

04:23.155 --> 04:25.384
I'm sorry, man, I fell asleep.
I've been on watch all day.

04:25.408 --> 04:27.618
We've all been on watch all day!

04:27.785 --> 04:29.745
That bullet was one less
dead Grounder.

04:29.912 --> 04:33.791
- Bell, you're scaring people.
- They should be scared!

04:33.958 --> 04:36.168
The bomb on the bridge
bought us some time to prepare!

04:36.419 --> 04:38.170
But that time is up!

04:38.337 --> 04:40.631
The Grounders
are out there right now,

04:40.798 --> 04:45.177
waiting for us to leave and
picking us off one by one when we do!

04:45.344 --> 04:47.597
Clarke, Finn and Monty are gone.

04:48.306 --> 04:49.682
Probably dead.

04:51.392 --> 04:54.103
And if you wanna be next,
I can't stop you!

04:54.312 --> 04:57.148
But no guns are leaving this camp!

04:57.940 --> 05:02.486
This camp is the only thing
keeping us alive!

05:07.575 --> 05:08.784
Get back to work!

05:41.651 --> 05:43.110
Your left flank is vulnerable.

05:46.364 --> 05:49.825
My archers are in the trees
with orders to kill anyone hostile.

05:50.368 --> 05:53.287
You're not hostile, are you, Tristan?

05:59.001 --> 06:00.586
So this is who's beating you?

06:02.046 --> 06:03.089
Who are you?

06:05.549 --> 06:07.885
I'm the man sent
to slaughter your people.

06:10.846 --> 06:13.307
The commander sent you?

06:14.767 --> 06:16.560
Your unit is mine now.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.855
My rangers are hungry.

06:20.022 --> 06:22.483
They're at the river.

06:22.650 --> 06:23.651
Go feed them!

06:31.075 --> 06:33.786
We march on the invaders' camp
at first light.

06:34.537 --> 06:36.914
I'll make quick work
of what you failed to do.

06:37.248 --> 06:39.667
Starting with this one.

06:42.420 --> 06:44.880
- Over there.
- A signal fire!

06:50.928 --> 06:52.263
Reapers.

06:52.430 --> 06:54.890
<i>- Let them know we see it.
- Quickly!</i>

06:56.434 --> 06:58.769
I'll send my fastest rider
to warn the commander.

06:58.936 --> 07:00.813
No, there's no time.

07:00.980 --> 07:03.858
Kill the prisoner,
get to the river.

07:11.782 --> 07:14.326
Is the boy dead?

07:16.162 --> 07:17.455
- Good.
- Finn!

07:17.621 --> 07:20.207
Kill the girl, then catch up.

08:09.632 --> 08:11.842
Don't you think I wanna
go after them, too?

08:14.470 --> 08:17.515
If it was you out there,

08:17.681 --> 08:21.727
you think Monty, Clarke or Finn
would hide behind these walls?

08:21.894 --> 08:25.147
No. They'd go after me,

08:25.314 --> 08:26.690
and then they'd be dead, too.

08:26.857 --> 08:29.235
I am doing what I think
is right for the group.

08:31.529 --> 08:34.615
It's funny you didn't think that way
when Octavia went missing.

08:35.573 --> 08:38.702
- Where are you going?
- More gunpowder for your minefield,

08:38.869 --> 08:39.870
sir.

08:45.709 --> 08:48.003
Water! Please!

08:53.509 --> 08:55.302
I'll get you some.

09:16.073 --> 09:18.284
Water...

09:27.042 --> 09:30.087
This is for tying the noose
that they hung me with.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.761
Say hi to Connor for me.

09:51.734 --> 09:55.654
He stopped breathing, and I was...
I was trying to help him.

10:13.297 --> 10:17.134
Murphy, put the gun down.

10:20.596 --> 10:22.890
He tried to kill me.

10:23.974 --> 10:27.645
- Don't move!
- Okay.

10:27.811 --> 10:29.772
Okay.

10:31.774 --> 10:33.067
It's cool.

10:34.485 --> 10:36.403
No, it's not.

10:37.029 --> 10:39.990
You know what will happen to me
if you tell Bellamy.

10:40.157 --> 10:42.159
<i>Tell Bellamy what?</i>

10:49.667 --> 10:52.503
Give me the radio, Jasper.

10:58.842 --> 11:01.303
- Murphy has a gun. He killed...
- Shut up!

11:01.470 --> 11:03.847
Murphy, what the hell are you doing?

11:10.312 --> 11:11.605
Murphy!

11:12.231 --> 11:15.192
Murphy! Open the damn door!

11:15.359 --> 11:18.529
You try to be a hero,
Jasper dies!

12:14.043 --> 12:15.919
Finn?

12:18.255 --> 12:20.090
Oh, my God!

12:26.805 --> 12:28.098
I don't understand how...

12:34.980 --> 12:36.815
Lincoln saved my life.

12:36.982 --> 12:39.318
He killed one of his own people
to do it.

12:41.487 --> 12:42.905
The signal fire?

12:44.156 --> 12:46.075
That was you?

12:46.241 --> 12:47.993
We needed a distraction.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.746
I'd say it worked.

12:52.081 --> 12:54.375
- Not well enough.
- What's it mean?

12:54.541 --> 12:56.627
It means Anya
knows Clarke's not dead.

12:56.794 --> 12:58.462
We need to hurry.

13:01.423 --> 13:03.634
Let's hope they follow the horse.

13:03.801 --> 13:06.261
- Hey, what do we do now?
- Now, we run!

13:16.313 --> 13:19.233
Come on!
It's right up here!

13:19.400 --> 13:21.652
- What is?
- Some place they won't follow.

13:25.697 --> 13:28.033
- Wait. Where does it lead?
- Everywhere.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.011
There's a tunnel near your camp.
If we make it through,

13:30.035 --> 13:31.435
we should get there before Tristan.

13:34.832 --> 13:36.041
Go.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.292
Go!

13:49.179 --> 13:50.764
Lincoln!

13:51.223 --> 13:52.349
Anya, no!

13:52.516 --> 13:54.685
We know where they're going.

13:55.060 --> 13:57.855
If the mine doesn't kill them first.

13:59.189 --> 14:00.858
Come on!

14:10.576 --> 14:13.203
Abby, BP's dropping
down to 96 over 55.

14:13.662 --> 14:15.664
We never should have
opened her back up.

14:15.747 --> 14:18.375
- It was the only way to save her.
- Save her for what?

14:18.584 --> 14:20.502
She'll be dead in two days.
We all will!

14:20.752 --> 14:22.337
She's crashing!

14:27.050 --> 14:28.802
Another amp of epi.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.971
Starting CPR.

14:34.808 --> 14:35.934
Come on.

14:36.143 --> 14:38.479
- We can't give her any more epi...
- Rationing is over.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.285
- Now, get me the damn epinephrine!
- There is no more epinephrine!

14:41.732 --> 14:43.609
We're all out!

14:47.738 --> 14:50.574
Come on! Come on, breathe!

14:51.909 --> 14:53.911
You have to let her go.

15:15.098 --> 15:17.434
I failed. I failed.

15:18.977 --> 15:21.063
You did the best that you could.

15:21.230 --> 15:22.856
You always do.

15:26.652 --> 15:28.278
She's gonna hate me forever.

15:30.781 --> 15:33.283
She blames me for her father's death.

15:35.410 --> 15:38.205
I'll never get
to make that right now.

15:42.334 --> 15:43.961
Never get to hug her.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.019
Can't protect her anymore.

16:01.186 --> 16:03.647
Clarke doesn't hate you, Abby.

16:03.814 --> 16:05.649
She's just...

16:06.817 --> 16:09.236
She's just strong-willed.

16:09.403 --> 16:10.612
Like her mom.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.282
You gave her that.

16:13.824 --> 16:15.492
That's how you're protecting her.

16:16.034 --> 16:19.204
And that's what will keep
her alive on the ground.

16:22.374 --> 16:24.376
Thank you, Jackson.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.849
Get out of here.
Go on.

17:07.002 --> 17:09.713
Look out! I just heard Murphy
has Jasper.

17:10.047 --> 17:12.257
Yeah. South foxhole done?

17:12.424 --> 17:15.344
What? Bellamy, my friend's
in there with a killer.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.387
Look around.
No one's working.

17:17.554 --> 17:19.634
If the Grounders attack us right now,
we're all dead.

17:19.723 --> 17:23.602
Murphy, if you even touch Jasper,
I swear to God,

17:23.769 --> 17:24.996
- you're dead!
- Octavia, I got this!

17:25.020 --> 17:27.123
Really? 'Cause it doesn't look like
you're doing anything about it.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.066
Bellamy.
You were right.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.544
There's a loose panel on the back.

17:31.568 --> 17:33.987
If I can pop it,
we can get in through the floor.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.906
Good. Do it.

17:39.660 --> 17:40.911
Sorry.

17:44.706 --> 17:46.625
Murphy, I know you can hear me.

17:47.209 --> 17:49.628
<i>All our ammo and food is in the
middle level. You know that.</i>

17:49.795 --> 17:52.881
You're leaving us vulnerable to an attack.
I can't let that happen.

17:54.424 --> 17:55.784
Well, in case you haven't noticed,

17:55.842 --> 17:58.387
you're not exactly
in control right now.

17:58.553 --> 18:02.224
Come on, Murphy. You don't wanna
hurt Jasper. You wanna hurt me.

18:05.686 --> 18:07.020
<i>So what do you say?</i>

18:09.523 --> 18:11.692
How about you trade him for me?

18:12.609 --> 18:14.236
- No!
- All you have to do

18:14.403 --> 18:17.030
is let him go
and I'll take his place.

18:23.078 --> 18:26.206
- How?
- Bellamy!

18:26.373 --> 18:28.750
If you do this, he'll kill you.

18:29.501 --> 18:31.294
If I don't, he'll kill Jasper.

18:34.256 --> 18:37.092
Simple.
You open the door,

18:37.300 --> 18:40.137
<i>I walk in, he walks out.</i>

18:59.656 --> 19:02.909
<i>- Just you, Bellamy! Unarmed!</i>
- Take this.

19:03.076 --> 19:06.288
<i>Ten seconds, or I'll put one
in Jasper's leg!</i>

19:06.913 --> 19:08.457
- One.
- Raven will find a way

19:08.623 --> 19:10.876
- to get you out.
- I can handle Murphy.

19:11.042 --> 19:13.211
Get everyone back to work.
Grounders are still coming.

19:13.378 --> 19:16.006
- Four! Five!
<i>- I'm here!</i>

19:26.057 --> 19:28.310
Jasper. Are you okay?

19:53.251 --> 19:55.712
You were right.
They didn't follow us.

19:57.881 --> 19:59.925
Reapers use these tunnels.

20:00.091 --> 20:02.469
Tristan wouldn't risk
running into them.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.387
What the hell's a reaper?

20:05.305 --> 20:07.516
Pray you never find out.

20:11.603 --> 20:13.396
We have to keep moving.

20:13.563 --> 20:16.233
Lincoln! You're hit!

20:16.399 --> 20:17.776
Hey, let me look at that.

20:24.366 --> 20:27.494
I've fought battles
with worse wounds than this.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.287
We're not in a battle right now.

20:30.205 --> 20:31.915
Yes we are.

20:36.294 --> 20:38.296
Why are you helping us?

20:40.423 --> 20:41.842
This can't just be about Octavia.

20:44.094 --> 20:46.304
Fine, don't tell us.
Give me your knife.

20:48.932 --> 20:50.767
Heat the blade.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.771
You might want something
to bite down on.

20:54.938 --> 20:56.773
You people are so soft.

20:56.940 --> 20:58.942
If you don't learn to be more...

21:16.960 --> 21:21.131
What my people are
doing to yours is wrong.

21:54.789 --> 21:58.501
- Very cool.
- Stop thinking like a mechanic.

21:58.668 --> 22:01.254
- Find me something to shoot through.
- This mechanic is

22:01.421 --> 22:04.841
- gonna hotwire the door.
- There's the hatch.

22:05.008 --> 22:06.468
Locks are above.
Forget it.

22:08.887 --> 22:10.180
Damn it!

22:10.347 --> 22:12.182
- He's up there because of me!
- Shh!

22:13.016 --> 22:15.018
Help me find a door circuit.

22:15.185 --> 22:16.770
We lost Clarke.

22:16.937 --> 22:20.649
- We can't lose Bellamy, too.
- Jasper, shut up!

22:20.815 --> 22:23.443
They are, like,
right above your head.

22:24.945 --> 22:26.112
Good.

22:27.864 --> 22:29.908
I'll just shoot through the floor.

22:30.075 --> 22:32.285
I just need to figure out
where Murphy is.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.120
Bad idea.

22:39.042 --> 22:41.419
Holy crap! There's tons of it.

22:41.586 --> 22:44.339
The engine's firing blade
on the way down.

22:44.506 --> 22:47.550
- We can make more bombs.
- Yeah.

22:47.717 --> 22:49.803
Put that on our to-do list.

22:49.970 --> 22:52.472
From now on, no shooting.
You got me?

22:54.182 --> 22:55.392
That's good.

22:56.393 --> 22:57.394
Then do what I said.

22:58.228 --> 22:59.896
<i>Bellamy?</i>

23:04.484 --> 23:06.820
Bellamy, are you okay?

23:06.987 --> 23:08.738
You want her to know you're alive?

23:10.115 --> 23:11.658
Start tying.

23:12.909 --> 23:15.036
<i>Bellamy, do you copy?</i>

23:16.746 --> 23:17.747
I'm fine.

23:18.707 --> 23:20.542
<i>Just a misfire.</i>

23:20.667 --> 23:23.294
<i>Stop worrying about me
and get back to work. All of you.</i>

23:25.255 --> 23:26.965
And tell Raven to hurry her ass up.

23:27.132 --> 23:29.134
All right, that's long enough.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.178
Tie those two ends together.

23:33.054 --> 23:35.098
Get that door open.

23:41.104 --> 23:42.897
All right.
Now, get up and toss it over.

23:58.455 --> 24:00.457
What do you want me to say?

24:01.291 --> 24:03.626
You want me to apologize?
I'm...

24:07.630 --> 24:09.340
I'm sorry.

24:12.427 --> 24:14.387
You got it all wrong, Bellamy.

24:15.346 --> 24:18.475
I don't want you to say anything.

24:19.684 --> 24:22.812
I want you to feel what I felt,
and then...

24:25.398 --> 24:27.358
Then I want you to die.

24:50.090 --> 24:53.343
<i>What are you two doing over there?
Come on.</i>

24:53.510 --> 24:55.553
<i>Let's rehearse for the unity pageant.</i>

24:56.888 --> 24:59.224
<i>- The stations...
- The other stations.</i>

24:59.349 --> 25:04.395
<i>The other stations saw this,
and wanted to be together, too.</i>

25:04.562 --> 25:07.732
<i>- That's very good.
- When all the stations were joined,</i>

25:07.899 --> 25:12.112
<i>- they called themselves the Ark.
- Good job, Wells.</i>

25:12.946 --> 25:15.281
<i>Daddy, how did the Ark
stay in space?</i>

25:15.448 --> 25:17.033
<i>Good question.</i>

25:17.200 --> 25:20.120
<i>By keeping out of the Earth's
gravitational pull.</i>

25:20.286 --> 25:23.081
<i>My daddy says it's the thrusters.</i>

25:23.248 --> 25:26.376
<i>Well, your daddy's right, Clarke.
There are thrusters all over the Ark.</i>

25:26.543 --> 25:28.336
<i>Every station has them.</i>

25:28.503 --> 25:31.381
<i>They keep us spinning so that
we generate our own gravity.</i>

25:31.548 --> 25:35.093
<i>They help us stay in orbit
and they help us steer.</i>

25:38.138 --> 25:39.138
Yes.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.823
Yes.

25:57.782 --> 25:59.951
If you've never been down here,
how'd you map it?

26:00.118 --> 26:01.828
Spoils of war.

26:05.415 --> 26:07.417
What is that?

26:12.046 --> 26:13.089
Reapers.

26:21.306 --> 26:22.432
Stand on it.

26:28.229 --> 26:29.522
Put it over your head.

26:33.067 --> 26:35.320
This is insane.
The Grounders could...

26:38.531 --> 26:39.532
No!

26:42.118 --> 26:44.412
- We need to do this now.
- I'm working as fast as I can.

26:44.579 --> 26:46.979
The wires for the door are mixed in
with the ignition system.

26:47.123 --> 26:49.542
Sparking the wrong one
would be bad.

26:50.543 --> 26:52.712
Put it over your head.

26:57.217 --> 26:59.052
Happy now?

27:05.558 --> 27:08.561
You're so brave, aren't you?

27:08.728 --> 27:12.148
You came in here thinking you were
just gonna turn this whole thing around,

27:12.315 --> 27:15.276
that you were stronger than me,
that maybe one of your friends

27:15.443 --> 27:16.986
would come and help you?

27:19.113 --> 27:22.200
Well, what are you thinking now,
Bellamy? Hmm?

27:36.506 --> 27:39.300
This can't be the only way.
Check the map.

27:39.467 --> 27:41.862
If you want to get home before
Tristan slaughters your people,

27:41.886 --> 27:43.429
this is the only way.

27:52.355 --> 27:54.148
Clarke!

27:54.315 --> 27:55.441
The carts.

28:07.161 --> 28:08.997
What the hell is this?

28:16.337 --> 28:19.007
Tunnel on the right will lead you
to the woods near your camp.

28:19.173 --> 28:20.174
Take this.

28:21.634 --> 28:25.305
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna lead them away.

28:25.471 --> 28:26.764
Wait until they follow me.

28:28.057 --> 28:29.767
Then run.

28:31.227 --> 28:32.937
For Octavia.

28:34.397 --> 28:35.815
Wait a second.

28:35.982 --> 28:39.193
If they catch you,
they'll kill you.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.903
Worry about yourselves.

28:41.070 --> 28:43.531
Most of Tristan's rangers will be
at your gate by nightfall.

28:43.698 --> 28:45.366
But he'll send riders ahead, scouts.

28:45.533 --> 28:47.910
All of you have to be gone
before they arrive.

28:59.297 --> 29:01.090
One of them is coming.

29:02.884 --> 29:04.594
Where are we supposed to go?

29:07.472 --> 29:09.223
In my book, there's a map.

29:09.390 --> 29:12.685
Try the course to the eastern sea.
There's a clan there.

29:12.852 --> 29:15.063
Led by a woman called Luna,
a friend.

29:15.229 --> 29:16.731
Tell her I sent you.

29:20.234 --> 29:21.569
Thank you.

29:22.695 --> 29:25.073
Just get Octavia out of there.

29:48.638 --> 29:50.139
Let's go!

29:53.309 --> 29:55.103
Oh, my God!
Did you see that?

29:57.146 --> 29:59.482
Clarke, we need to keep moving.

30:04.987 --> 30:06.280
They're alive.

30:08.491 --> 30:10.201
Oh, my God!

30:10.368 --> 30:11.786
Clarke, look out!

30:32.432 --> 30:33.933
They're coming back.

30:34.100 --> 30:37.228
Finn? Come on, we've gotta go.
Get up. Get up!

30:38.396 --> 30:40.036
You know, I gotta hand it to you,
Bellamy.

30:40.148 --> 30:42.942
You got them all fooled.

30:43.109 --> 30:44.652
They actually look up to you.

30:44.819 --> 30:47.530
Almost as much
as they look up to Clarke.

30:47.697 --> 30:50.867
Yeah, but we know the truth,
don't we?

30:52.368 --> 30:53.995
You're a coward.

30:56.539 --> 30:59.584
I learned that the day you kicked
out the crate from beneath me.

31:00.168 --> 31:01.586
I think I found it.

31:02.044 --> 31:03.045
Get outside.

31:03.212 --> 31:05.131
Be ready when it opens.

31:10.678 --> 31:13.723
But you were just giving the people
what they wanted, right?

31:14.765 --> 31:16.058
I should have stopped them.

31:18.603 --> 31:21.063
Yeah, it's a little late
for that now.

31:26.068 --> 31:28.696
You think they're just gonna
let you walk out of here?

31:28.863 --> 31:31.741
Well, I think the princess
is dead.

31:33.034 --> 31:37.121
And I know the king's about to die,
so who's gonna really lead these people?

31:38.414 --> 31:39.957
Me. That's who.

31:40.124 --> 31:43.252
And yeah, maybe I have to kill
your Grounder-pounding little sister.

31:58.226 --> 32:00.937
I'm guessing that's her right now.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.295
Using your hands is a cheat.

32:26.462 --> 32:28.965
Mine were bound, remember?

32:38.307 --> 32:40.101
<i>Raven, you did it!</i>

32:54.574 --> 32:56.158
Bell, hold on!

33:08.504 --> 33:10.881
- Bell, breathe!
- Breathe! Can you breathe?

33:11.799 --> 33:13.843
Come on!

33:16.679 --> 33:19.181
You're okay. You're okay.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.476
Raven, he's fine!

33:26.689 --> 33:28.649
Murphy!

33:30.818 --> 33:33.070
Murphy! It's over!

33:38.868 --> 33:40.703
<i>Murphy!</i>

33:46.667 --> 33:49.337
<i>There's only one way out of this
for you now!</i>

33:49.545 --> 33:51.672
You wanna bet?

33:55.635 --> 33:58.804
- This doesn't look right.
- What the hell was that back there?

34:00.264 --> 34:02.892
Why would they keep them alive?

34:04.518 --> 34:06.413
I swear to God,
the more we learn about this place,

34:06.437 --> 34:08.105
the less we know.

34:14.487 --> 34:16.237
Hey, hey. Hey!

34:22.411 --> 34:24.121
He would have killed us.

34:25.289 --> 34:27.541
You did what you had to do.

34:30.293 --> 34:31.920
We all have.

34:37.092 --> 34:39.387
I should have fought for you.

34:40.971 --> 34:44.100
- Finn, don't.
- Clarke.

34:48.521 --> 34:49.522
I love you.

34:53.234 --> 34:55.027
I'm in love with you.

35:05.955 --> 35:07.748
You broke my heart.

35:10.835 --> 35:12.503
I'm sorry.

35:15.965 --> 35:19.593
I... I just can't.

35:19.969 --> 35:22.930
- It came from the camp.
- We're too late.

35:25.808 --> 35:27.059
Murphy!

35:38.529 --> 35:40.489
The guy knows how to make an exit.

35:41.991 --> 35:45.369
- Should we go after him?
- No.

35:51.167 --> 35:53.043
Grounders will take care of Murphy.

35:53.335 --> 35:56.255
We're going after Clarke,
Finn and Monty.

35:57.631 --> 35:59.467
You and Raven were right.

35:59.633 --> 36:01.510
We don't abandon our own.

36:02.678 --> 36:03.958
Two guns, you and me, that's it.

36:04.054 --> 36:06.098
Raven stays here
to build up defenses.

36:06.265 --> 36:09.018
We lost a day because of this,
and our gunpowder.

36:09.185 --> 36:11.103
- Raven!
- No, wait.

36:11.771 --> 36:15.107
Look, I just...

36:21.322 --> 36:22.782
Thank you.

36:27.036 --> 36:29.205
Long way from whatever
the hell you want.

36:31.207 --> 36:34.001
<i>All gunners, we got movement
outside the south wall!</i>

36:38.672 --> 36:41.926
Wait! Hold your fire!
It's Clarke and Finn, open the gate!

36:42.092 --> 36:44.011
Get the gate!

36:44.178 --> 36:46.764
<i>Move it! Move it!</i>

36:46.931 --> 36:50.226
<i>- Clarke and Finn, they're back!
- Close the gate!</i>

36:50.392 --> 36:52.019
We heard an explosion.
What happened?

36:52.186 --> 36:55.606
- Murphy happened.
- Thank God! Where have you been?

36:55.773 --> 36:57.650
- Where's Monty?
- Monty's gone?

36:57.817 --> 37:00.820
Clarke, we need to leave, now.
All of us do!

37:00.986 --> 37:04.073
There's an army of Grounders,
unlike anything we've ever seen,

37:04.240 --> 37:06.826
coming for us right now.
We need to pack what we can and run.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.078
Like hell we do.
We knew this was coming.

37:09.245 --> 37:11.664
- Bell, we're not prepared.
- And they're not here yet.

37:11.831 --> 37:13.999
We still have time to get ready.

37:14.166 --> 37:16.377
Besides, where would we go?

37:16.544 --> 37:18.838
Where would we be safer
than behind these walls?

37:19.004 --> 37:22.466
There's an ocean to the east.
People there will help us.

37:22.633 --> 37:24.343
- We saw Lincoln.
- Yeah.

37:24.510 --> 37:27.054
You expect us to trust a Grounder?

37:29.682 --> 37:31.809
This is our home now!

37:31.976 --> 37:35.020
We built this from nothing
with our bare hands!

37:35.187 --> 37:38.232
Our dead are buried behind that wall,
in this ground!

37:38.399 --> 37:40.568
Our ground!

37:40.734 --> 37:42.903
The Grounders think
they can take that away.

37:43.070 --> 37:45.739
They think that because we came
from the sky,

37:45.906 --> 37:47.491
we don't belong here.

37:47.658 --> 37:51.328
But they're yet to realize
one very important fact.

37:51.912 --> 37:54.540
We're on the ground now.

37:54.707 --> 37:58.252
- And that means we are Grounders!
<i>- Yeah!</i>

37:58.419 --> 38:00.796
<i>- Grounders with guns!</i>
- Damn right.

38:00.963 --> 38:02.756
I say let them come.

38:04.466 --> 38:06.010
Bellamy's right.

38:08.095 --> 38:12.308
If we leave, we may never find
a place as safe as this.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.686
And God knows, in this world...

38:16.729 --> 38:20.482
...we could be faced with something
even worse tomorrow.

38:21.191 --> 38:24.069
But that doesn't
change the simple fact

38:24.236 --> 38:27.865
that if we stay here,
we will die tonight.

38:28.574 --> 38:30.367
So pack your things.

38:30.534 --> 38:33.037
Just take what you can carry.

38:33.203 --> 38:34.788
Now!

38:43.589 --> 38:44.757
Where is he?

38:48.719 --> 38:50.554
<i>Help me!</i>

38:50.721 --> 38:52.598
Hey, it's Raven!

38:53.599 --> 38:55.309
Raven!

38:57.019 --> 38:59.772
- Murphy shot her.
- Get her into the dropship.

39:02.107 --> 39:04.735
Clarke! Leaving here is a mistake.

39:05.277 --> 39:08.280
- The decision's been made.
- Crowds make bad decisions.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.407
Just ask Murphy.

39:10.574 --> 39:12.868
Leaders do what they think is right.

39:15.371 --> 39:16.747
I am.

39:30.552 --> 39:33.389
<i>What if we jettison sections
three through seven?</i>

39:35.891 --> 39:38.894
<i>Sir, we've run every scenario twice.</i>

39:39.436 --> 39:41.563
There are no more options.

39:43.607 --> 39:46.860
I would really like to be
with my wife.

39:46.986 --> 39:50.114
Chancellor on deck.

39:51.198 --> 39:52.574
At ease, Sinclair.

39:54.284 --> 39:56.996
- Anything to report?
- No, sir.

39:57.913 --> 39:59.832
Nothing we've tried
will save the Ark.

39:59.999 --> 40:02.209
Have you tried not saving it?

40:04.670 --> 40:06.171
What is this about?

40:09.550 --> 40:11.844
It's about going home.

40:15.889 --> 40:18.559
From where I stand,
we have two options...

40:19.268 --> 40:21.437
Die in space,

40:21.603 --> 40:24.440
or probably die trying to get
to the ground.

40:27.192 --> 40:29.445
We have no more Exodus ships, sir.

40:29.862 --> 40:33.615
You're wrong, Kane.
There is one.

40:36.702 --> 40:38.328
We call it the Ark.

40:41.415 --> 40:44.793
Sinclair, please tell us
what would happen

40:44.960 --> 40:47.963
if we use the thrusters
that keep the Ark in orbit

40:48.130 --> 40:51.425
to propel us into
the atmosphere instead.

40:52.926 --> 40:54.636
The Ark would break apart,

40:54.803 --> 40:56.346
first into its original 12 stations,

40:56.513 --> 40:59.975
then further
as the violence intensified.

41:00.142 --> 41:03.645
Ninety-five percent of the structures
would explode on the way down.

41:06.398 --> 41:09.118
Think you're smart enough to pinpoint
the five percent that wouldn't?

41:15.491 --> 41:17.659
Are we really gonna do this?

41:19.328 --> 41:21.872
Bring the Ark to the ground?

41:25.000 --> 41:27.002
You have a better idea?

41:37.012 --> 41:38.555
What do you say, Abby?

41:40.099 --> 41:41.600
You ready to see your daughter again?
