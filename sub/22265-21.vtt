-Hmm.

we'll do that together, too.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.587
He said he needed a minute alone.

02:40.720 --> 02:44.417
He wanted to extract his grace
by himself. "In private. "

So, I left him alone in Dean's room.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.627
I hate to interrupt,

but I can't be
the only one who's noticed

02:55.840 --> 02:57.819
the rather glaring hole in this plan.

02:57.920 --> 03:02.698
We open up the rift, it gives us a day
to find and save your mum and the boy,

03:02.800 --> 03:04.825

One could even say premature.

What do we do now?

04:51.960 --> 04:52.949

04:53.040 --> 04:56.100
You do know. We all do.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.739
We need archangel grace.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.058
Gabriel's obviously
running a little low,

05:02.160 --> 05:04.663
and we don't know how long
it'll take him to recover.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.787
So that leaves exactly
one source on Earth.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.747
- No.
- I don't like it either

05:09.840 --> 05:11.467

get mom and Jack back.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.821
No, we're not teaming up with him.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.023
We just need his grace.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.701
Oh, "just."

05:39.800 --> 05:40.869
We've trapped his ass before.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.860
Yes. And every time,
it ends up the same way.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.906
With the Devil being
on the loose. Again.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.185
Look, Sam. I was used by Lucifer, too.

05:51.680 --> 05:54.137
It was the worst possible violation.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.504
So, I'm not
taking your reluctance lightly,

05:56.600 --> 06:00.422
but he is already out there,
and we've been ignoring it

06:00.520 --> 06:05.503
and avoiding dealing with him
because we're afraid.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.983
We let Lucifer out of the Cage.

And he has never stopped
being our responsibility.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.063
You brought me back.

36:24.200 --> 36:28.102
I did. You're welcome.

36:29.360 --> 36:31.817
- Why?
- I won't get into that.

36:33.320 --> 36:36.187
The rift. The rift. Rowena...

36:36.520 --> 36:39.705
Oh, she's Okay.
I mean, I was gonna kill her,

36:39.840 --> 36:42.627
but she blasted me here
before I had a Chance to, so...

36:42.760 --> 36:46.787
It's great self defense,
but I was coming here anyway.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.668
But we drained you.

36:48.960 --> 36:52.589
SO, how did I have the juice
to pull off my little Lazarus trick?

36:53.080 --> 36:54.297
Uh, that's a long story.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.897
But I was basically tracking you here,

36:57.000 --> 37:01.699
and then I came across a handful
of Michael's angels, and I...

37:03.920 --> 37:04.944
Ate them.

37:07.360 --> 37:10.420
I guess it's not really a long story,
is it?

37:10.800 --> 37:12.620
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

37:13.080 --> 37:17.221
I want what everyone wants.
I want a personal apology from Pop,

37:17.320 --> 37:20.539
I want rerun-free,
year round episodes of Drag Race.

37:20.640 --> 37:24.383
Yeah, got it. Okay. Right.
We're done here.

37:25.960 --> 37:27.143
Oh, you're going?

37:28.000 --> 37:31.026
Here, it's dark out there.

(VAM PIRES SNARLING)

37:40.240 --> 37:43.824
Yeah. They're sort of all over there
and I'm holding them back.

37:45.440 --> 37:47.465
They're just waiting
for a little snap of the fingers,

37:47.560 --> 37:50.984
but I didn't want them flooding in here
and eating you again.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.021
Not until after we finished our convo.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.985
What do you want?

38:01.960 --> 38:03.939
I want what you already have.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.264
A relationship with my son.

38:09.160 --> 38:10.149
(SIGHS)

38:11.320 --> 38:14.744
Okay, there was a time that I would,
you know, just grab him.

38:14.840 --> 38:17.502
But I've grown.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.149
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

38:19.240 --> 38:20.867
I have, Samuel.

38:22.080 --> 38:26.460
I want my son. And you're gonna help me.

38:27.760 --> 38:28.943
H ow?

38:29.040 --> 38:30.940
Well, I don't feel like
he'll give me a chance

38:31.040 --> 38:32.587
unless I come bearing gifts.

38:35.040 --> 38:37.827
Yeah. Boop. That's you.

38:39.920 --> 38:44.300
Look, Sammy, I'm not asking you
to like it, or to like me.

38:44.400 --> 38:47.346
All I'm asking is
that you acknowledge the truth.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.704
That I was the one
who brought you back to life.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.621
And I was the one who lifted you
from the darkness and into the light.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.183
Okay?

38:58.160 --> 39:00.583
Apocalypse World, Michael's armies.

39:00.680 --> 39:04.707
You really think you and your family
can handle that stuff alone?

39:04.800 --> 39:06.779
You need me.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.146
And what if I say no?

39:12.240 --> 39:15.664
(CLEARS THROAT) All right. Let me just
make this really, really, really easy.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.705
Easy enough for you
to understand, Sammy.

39:17.800 --> 39:21.099
I'm getting to Jack,
one way or the other.

39:21.200 --> 39:25.227

He can't be dead.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.578
- Jack, I know...
- Couldn't you bring him back?

40:30.600 --> 40:31.862
Why didn't you bring him back?

40:32.320 --> 40:33.639
I'm not strong enough.

40:34.240 --> 40:38.188
Jack, if we could have, we would have.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.199
I'm so sorry.
