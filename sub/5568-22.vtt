00:01.669 --> 00:04.903
¶¶

00:07.141 --> 00:10.175
"The head of the family
is the one with the tail."

00:10.177 --> 00:11.443
(chuckles)

00:11.445 --> 00:13.612
God, I want to see this.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.980
Finding everything okay, Louis?

00:14.982 --> 00:16.615
Oh, uh, yep. (Chuckles)

00:16.617 --> 00:18.484
Thanks, Corey. Just browsing.

00:18.486 --> 00:20.319
In the Critter Capers section?

00:20.321 --> 00:21.687
Oh. (Chuckles)

00:21.689 --> 00:24.523
I thought it said
"Criterion Capers."

00:24.525 --> 00:25.858
(chuckles)

00:25.860 --> 00:28.193
Like silent
French police dramas.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.495
(french accent) Inspector.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.163
(chuckles)

00:31.165 --> 00:35.334
(normal voice) Oh,<i> here's</i>
the movie I was looking for.

00:35.336 --> 00:36.502
"La Choffey."

00:36.504 --> 00:37.703
"La Chouffe."

00:37.705 --> 00:40.639
Gnome's folly.
It's a great choice.

00:40.641 --> 00:44.309
See, this is why you're one of
our favorite customers, Louis.

00:44.311 --> 00:45.644
Y-You get film.

00:45.646 --> 00:46.812
Most of the other people
who come in here,

00:46.814 --> 00:48.013
they just want the latest

00:48.015 --> 00:49.181
Mel Gibson movie

00:49.183 --> 00:50.883
or something with cars fighting.

00:50.885 --> 00:52.651
But not you.

00:52.653 --> 00:53.685
You're one of us.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.187
I really am.

00:55.189 --> 00:58.323
Oh, okay, you have a $2 late fee
on "Das Boot."

00:58.325 --> 01:00.225
But, uh, since you're
a fellow cinephile,

01:00.227 --> 01:01.660
I'm just gonna go ahead

01:01.662 --> 01:03.495
and das boot that
right off your account.

01:03.497 --> 01:04.730
(laughs)

01:04.732 --> 01:06.665
I understand that reference.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.068
Uh, and your other rentals
are due back Tuesday.

01:09.070 --> 01:11.170
Other rentals?

01:11.172 --> 01:13.172
Somebody from your family
came in last week

01:13.174 --> 01:14.706
and rented a bunch of movies.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.075
What? Who?

01:16.077 --> 01:17.876
Our store policy
says we can't reveal

01:17.878 --> 01:19.178
our customers' identities

01:19.180 --> 01:21.413
or any specifics on the account,

01:21.415 --> 01:24.516
but I can tell you
they have terrible taste.

01:24.518 --> 01:28.187
If it were up to me,
they'd be due back never.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.354
But it's not.

01:29.356 --> 01:31.123
So, it's Tuesday.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.526
Captions by VITAC...

01:34.528 --> 01:36.361
<i>¶ Fresh off the boat ¶</i>

01:36.363 --> 01:38.197
<i>¶ I'm gettin' mine

01:38.199 --> 01:39.765
<i>¶ If you don't know, homey,

01:39.767 --> 01:42.267
<i>¶ Fresh off the boat ¶</i>

01:42.269 --> 01:44.036
<i>¶ Homey, you don't know

01:44.038 --> 01:45.437

01:45.439 --> 01:48.273
<i>¶ I'm fresh off the boat ¶</i>

01:49.243 --> 01:51.543
Eddie, up now! School!

01:51.545 --> 01:53.445
Eddie: Who's Eddie?

01:53.447 --> 01:54.880
I'm Dorf.

01:54.882 --> 01:58.083
"Leonard,
keep your eye on the ball."

01:58.085 --> 02:01.120
I don't know who that is,
but I don't have time for jokes.

02:01.122 --> 02:03.222
Stop playing invalids
and get dressed.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.456
¶¶

02:05.392 --> 02:06.725
Okay, who was it?

02:06.727 --> 02:08.727
Who used my card to rent movies?

02:08.729 --> 02:10.395
Just tell me who it was.

02:10.397 --> 02:12.397
I won't be mad.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.066
(sighs) Come on.

02:14.068 --> 02:16.301
I know one of you took my card,
went to the video store,

02:16.303 --> 02:18.070
embarrassed me
in front of Corey.

02:18.072 --> 02:19.938
Louis, nobody knows
what you're talking about.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.473
Let the boys focus
on their breakfast.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.908
Staring contest.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.743
I didn't know.
It's too early to compete.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.645
Too late. I'm staring at you!

02:26.647 --> 02:27.980
Eddie, stop distracting Evan.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.748
He has a spelling test.
He needs to eat.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.084
You can still eat, right, Evan?

02:32.086 --> 02:36.321
¶¶

02:37.925 --> 02:39.258
I never wanted this.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.760
I'll wait outside.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.262
(sighs)

02:43.264 --> 02:44.997
Game over.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.665
Now move.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.500
We tied!

02:48.502 --> 02:49.935
Okay, come on. We got to go.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.270
Let's go. Come on, please.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.604
Mom. I need you to sign this.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.439
I'm not gonna sign
another doctor's note

02:54.441 --> 02:56.441
granting you permission
to eat two lunches.

02:56.443 --> 02:59.678
It's my permission slip
for my history-class field trip.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.147
Field trips are just
paid vacations for teachers.

03:02.149 --> 03:04.650
I don't pay taxes
so they can walk around a museum

03:04.652 --> 03:06.118
telling our children

03:06.120 --> 03:07.953
that a painting of a soup can
is beautiful.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.788
What?! But...

03:09.790 --> 03:11.456
When your class
goes on the field trip,

03:11.458 --> 03:12.958
you can just do CLC
in the library.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.159
End of discussion. Okay.

03:14.161 --> 03:16.328
You never let me do anything.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.996
(sighs)

03:17.998 --> 03:20.632
Louis, I'm going with Honey
to the mall to run some errands.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.334
Maybe I'll eat a pretzel
or a doughnut.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.036
Okay! Just finishing my coffee,

03:24.038 --> 03:26.004
and then I'm off to work
like normal.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.306
(door closes)

03:27.308 --> 03:29.308
Just as soon
as I find those tapes.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.843
<i>¶ Creepin' up on ya,
creepin', creepin' up on ya ¶</i>

03:31.845 --> 03:34.146
<i>¶ Creepin' up on ya,
creepin', creepin' up on ya ¶</i>

03:34.148 --> 03:36.181
<i>¶ Creepin' up on ya,
creepin', creepin' up on ya ¶</i>

03:36.183 --> 03:38.850
<i>¶ Don't try to put me down,
I don't feel pain and sorrow ¶</i>

03:38.852 --> 03:40.852
<i>¶ The sun will come out! ¶
¶ Yeah tomorrow, tomorrow ¶</i>

03:40.854 --> 03:42.821
<i>¶ I bet your bottom dollar that
tomorrow, there'll be sun ¶</i>

03:42.823 --> 03:45.057
<i>¶ Showin' gratitude,
my attitude is kind of rude ¶</i>

03:45.059 --> 03:47.826
<i>¶ I walk with a frown
while I puff my cigar ¶</i>

03:47.828 --> 03:49.995
<i>¶ Creepin' up on ya,
creepin', creepin' up on ya ¶</i>

03:49.997 --> 03:53.232
What the hell?

03:53.234 --> 03:56.068
So many nipples.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.506
Ah! Don't lift him
by the neck, Louis.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.008
Lift him by the sphenoid.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.009
Uh-huh.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.877
Uh-huh.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.179
Uh, Marvin,
I actually just came over

04:07.181 --> 04:09.181
to ask your advice
about something.

04:09.183 --> 04:11.550
Uh, okay. What a beauty.

04:11.552 --> 04:14.353
You know, I got him
when he was drinking water.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.255
Pow.
That's why his tongue's out.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.857
(chuckles)
Anyway, what were you saying?

04:18.859 --> 04:22.027
Oh, um, does Honey ever...

04:22.029 --> 04:22.861
look at other men?

04:22.863 --> 04:24.096
Why?

04:24.098 --> 04:25.364
What the hell did you hear?

04:25.366 --> 04:27.266
Nothing. Uh, it's just...

04:27.268 --> 04:30.602
I found some tapes under
Jessica's side of the bed.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.871
Shirtless-men tapes.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.439
Shirtless-men tapes?

04:34.441 --> 04:36.375
Action movies.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.610
Stallone, Schwarzenegger,
Van Damme.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.212
Oh. (Chuckles) Uh-huh.

04:40.214 --> 04:42.414
And you're worried
that you're not giving Jessica

04:42.416 --> 04:45.884
the macho action-movie energy
she clearly craves.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.052
(laughs)

04:47.054 --> 04:48.587
You know,

04:48.589 --> 04:51.123
now that I hear it out loud,
it does sound kind of crazy.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.224
No, it doesn't.

04:52.226 --> 04:54.059
You should be worried.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.128
What? She probably kept
it a secret from you

04:56.130 --> 04:57.763
because she didn't want
to hurt your feelings,

04:57.765 --> 05:00.465
which you shouldn't even have
in the first place.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.601
Maybe you're right, Marvin.

05:02.603 --> 05:06.605
Tonight, I'm going to sit her
down and really talk it out.

05:06.607 --> 05:07.939
Talk?

05:07.941 --> 05:09.641
That's what got you
into this mess.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.577
They're action heroes,
not talking heroes.

05:12.579 --> 05:15.580
You want to solve the problem,
you got to act.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.916
You think
I took that stag to tea

05:17.918 --> 05:21.420
and floated the idea
of mounting his head on my wall?

05:21.422 --> 05:22.954
No. I just did it.

05:22.956 --> 05:23.989
Pow!

05:23.991 --> 05:25.424
You want to stop Jessica

05:25.426 --> 05:26.958
from watching those tapes?

05:26.960 --> 05:30.462
You got to show her
you can be that kind of a man.

05:30.464 --> 05:31.630
Pow.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.265
Pow.

05:33.267 --> 05:34.800
Pow! Pow!

05:34.802 --> 05:36.001
(chuckles)

05:36.003 --> 05:37.669
¶¶

05:37.671 --> 05:40.806
I'm telling you, it was him!

05:40.808 --> 05:44.142
Why would Steven Tyler be
at the Sharper Image in Orlando?

05:44.144 --> 05:45.977
Because he wants
a fogless shave mirror, Honey.

05:45.979 --> 05:49.681
Anyway, how's everything else?
How are your boys doing?

05:49.683 --> 05:52.484
Fine. Eddie's mad at me because I won't
let him go on his history field trip.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.653
The one
to Colonial Floridatowne?

05:54.655 --> 05:56.822
Believe me,
you're doing the right thing.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.523
I chaperoned when Nicole went,

05:58.525 --> 06:01.193
and let's just say the bathrooms
are very realistic.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.829
Did you just say
Colonial Floridatowne?

06:03.831 --> 06:06.331
They are literally wood sheds
with a hole in the ground.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.633
I love
colonial American history!

06:08.635 --> 06:12.003
Colonial Americans
were like the Chinese of today.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.473
Their struggle,
their work ethic,

06:14.475 --> 06:17.342
their ability to use every
single part of the buffalo.

06:17.344 --> 06:19.978
I mean, you've seen
my porcelain colonial mice.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.314
¶¶

06:22.316 --> 06:23.882
What the...?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.317
Colonial Americans survived

06:25.319 --> 06:26.985
under the harshest
of circumstances,

06:26.987 --> 06:30.055
and for that,
they deserve our respect.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.223
Look at this one.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.692
Proud, hard-working,

06:33.694 --> 06:35.527
holding out her milk jug
to the world

06:35.529 --> 06:38.697
as if to say,
"Show me your worst, America.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.365
I'll still have milk."

06:40.367 --> 06:42.667
This one looks a little bit

06:42.669 --> 06:44.903
like Sally Field,
don't you think?

06:44.905 --> 06:47.606
I think that one
looks<i> a lot</i> like Sally Field.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.210
Where's your brother?

06:52.212 --> 06:54.846
He's playing Super Mario
in his room.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.681
He says it's nice
to start the day with a victory.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.350
Eddie, you're gonna be late!

06:58.352 --> 07:01.753
Stop playing Italian Maintenance
Twins and get in here!

07:01.755 --> 07:05.757
¶¶

07:13.033 --> 07:15.200
(grunts)

07:15.202 --> 07:18.537
Later, I'm going to dig
a trash pit and burn this.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.705
Louis, what are you doing?
Put a shirt on.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.541
I feel more comfortable
this way.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.075
You hate being shirtless.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.877
You wear a t-shirt in the ocean.

07:25.879 --> 07:26.878
(sighs)

07:26.880 --> 07:28.380
I'm trying to give you

07:28.382 --> 07:31.283
the macho action-movie energy
you clearly crave.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.951
What are you talking about?

07:32.953 --> 07:35.454
I found your tapes, Jessica.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.255
The ones you keep hidden
under our mattress.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.957
Your action-movie tapes.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.625
I don't watch action movies.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.562
The only movies I watch
are riveting Denzel dramas

07:43.564 --> 07:44.629
about legal briefs.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.730
"Where are the legal briefs?"

07:45.732 --> 07:47.732
Who has the legal briefs?

07:47.734 --> 07:50.402
"Julia Roberts,
get me the legal briefs."

07:50.404 --> 07:53.572
Okay, so if you didn't
rent them, who did?

07:53.574 --> 07:54.806
Probably your mother.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.241
I already searched her room.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.143
All I found
was a Chow Yun-Fat calendar.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.744
¶¶

07:59.746 --> 08:01.246
Somebody in this house
is lying to me,

08:01.248 --> 08:02.647
and I'm gonna find out who.

08:02.649 --> 08:06.985
¶¶

08:08.655 --> 08:11.089
Forgetting something?

08:11.091 --> 08:13.592
Uh, why are you giving me this?

08:13.594 --> 08:14.926
I changed my mind.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.628
You can go
on your history field trip.

08:16.630 --> 08:17.929
Really?

08:17.931 --> 08:19.431
Thanks, Mom.

08:19.433 --> 08:20.665
Wait.

08:20.667 --> 08:21.766
Why are<i> you</i> wearing a hat?

08:21.768 --> 08:23.835
Because I'm coming with you

08:23.837 --> 08:25.670
as parent chaperone.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.772
We leave at first light.

08:27.774 --> 08:33.011
¶¶

08:38.452 --> 08:41.620
Aha!

08:41.622 --> 08:43.188
Emery?

08:43.190 --> 08:45.557
I can explain.

08:51.465 --> 08:53.198
Are you mad?

08:53.200 --> 08:57.335
Oh, uh, (chuckles) no, no,
I'm not, uh, mad.

08:57.337 --> 09:02.307
I-I-I-I-I-I'm just, um, well...

09:02.309 --> 09:07.312
you know, Emery, you're at
an age where, uh, your body...

09:07.314 --> 09:09.214
A-a-and by that I mean...

09:09.216 --> 09:15.487
Uh, uh, uh,
a father's love knows no...

09:15.489 --> 09:20.525
Greg Louganis is a wonderful...
And Broadway.

09:20.527 --> 09:23.395
Uh, although we may not live
in the best state for...

09:23.397 --> 09:25.997
The tapes were research
for school.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.166
(laughs) I knew it.

09:28.168 --> 09:31.002
I knew it was homework-related.

09:31.004 --> 09:35.206
Not exactly. You know how
I've always made friends easily?

09:35.208 --> 09:37.709
Well, there's been a change
at school.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.844
It's like it happened overnight.

09:39.846 --> 09:42.847
And I'm tapping five mana
to cast Ancestral Tentacle Grab,

09:42.849 --> 09:44.349
dealing two damage
to all your...

09:44.351 --> 09:46.051
Oops.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.286
(chuckles nervously)

09:50.190 --> 09:51.690
(deep voice) You guys are dorks.

09:51.692 --> 09:54.693
I'm gonna go throw bottles
at a train.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.862
Suddenly, all of my friends
are acting like tough guys.

09:57.864 --> 10:01.232
All they want to talk about
is cars, fire,

10:01.234 --> 10:03.101
and throwing things
at other things.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.603
And that's not me.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.538
I don't even know
how to hang with them anymore.

10:06.540 --> 10:08.406
Puberty strikes hard and quick,

10:08.408 --> 10:11.543
like a large soda halfway
through "Schindler's List."

10:11.545 --> 10:13.878
Anyway,
that's why I rented the tapes.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.781
The video store has
a whole section on tough guys.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.751
And I was hoping they might
help me figure it out.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.620
But I know what I'm gonna do.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.389
I've decided to write a poem.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.057
A poem?

10:26.059 --> 10:27.425
For class.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.227
I'm gonna tell
an epic story through verse

10:29.229 --> 10:32.597
and show that brains
are as valuable as brawn.

10:32.599 --> 10:35.967
Big no to that. Luckily,
as a small-business owner

10:35.969 --> 10:37.969
who relies on customer service,

10:37.971 --> 10:40.905
I understand the mechanics
of getting people to like you.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.741
You find out
what makes them tick,

10:42.743 --> 10:44.809
and then you use that
to relate to them.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.444
Like, uh,
these boys at school...

10:46.446 --> 10:47.746
How do they speak to each other?

10:47.748 --> 10:49.748
Well, they mostly
just insult each other

10:49.750 --> 10:51.249
and make jokes about farts.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.917
Like, "Who farted?"

10:52.919 --> 10:54.953
Did you fart? No,<i> I</i> farted.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.287
"Fart, fart, fart."

10:56.289 --> 10:57.756
(laughs)

10:57.758 --> 11:00.091
That's a funny joke.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.426
(laughs)

11:01.428 --> 11:04.262
So, they have a sense of humor.
Good.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.831
That'll be the key
to winning their respect.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.769
(colonial music playing)

11:10.771 --> 11:14.105
And group five
is Huang, Masterson,

11:14.107 --> 11:16.441
Stone, Selby, and Pew.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.176
Your chaperone
will be Mrs. Huang.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.811
Mother goose!

11:19.813 --> 11:21.980
Wait, Brian,
your last name is Pew?

11:21.982 --> 11:24.115
How long have we been friends?

11:24.117 --> 11:25.450
It's cool
that we're all together.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.619
Cool? My mom is our chaperone.

11:27.621 --> 11:29.354
So? It'll still be fun, right?

11:29.356 --> 11:31.489
No way. My mom hates fun!

11:31.491 --> 11:33.491
Boys.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.293
Here we go.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.696
We're not even inside yet,
and she's already starting...

11:37.698 --> 11:39.864
We're going rogue. What?!

11:39.866 --> 11:42.300
I looked at the map, and turns
out your class is only hitting

11:42.302 --> 11:44.302
the educational parts
of Floridatowne,

11:44.304 --> 11:46.638
which doesn't leave any time
for the good stuff.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.140
So we're going to forge
our own way.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.843
It's what
the colonials would have done.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.011
Come on!

11:53.013 --> 11:55.647
What are you waiting for, Pew?

11:55.649 --> 11:57.449
Follow her.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.651
(laughter)

11:59.653 --> 12:01.686
You forgot to wipe.

12:01.688 --> 12:02.987
(laughter)

12:02.989 --> 12:04.389
Hey, Chad.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.490
Want to hear a joke?

12:05.492 --> 12:06.991
Your face looks like a butt,

12:06.993 --> 12:08.993
and whenever you talk,
it sounds like a fart.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.528
(chuckling)

12:10.530 --> 12:13.264
(chuckles nervously)

12:22.042 --> 12:24.342
And that's how
colonial women used milk

12:24.344 --> 12:27.679
to get out even the most
stubborn of household stains.

12:27.681 --> 12:31.683
Now, who wants to help me get the
blood out of this undershirt?

12:31.685 --> 12:33.585
(indistinct shouting)
Jessica: Come on, come on!

12:33.587 --> 12:36.221
<i>¶ Some of the busiest rhymes
ever made by man ¶</i>

12:36.223 --> 12:38.923
<i>¶ Are goin' into this mike,
written by this hand ¶</i>

12:38.925 --> 12:42.093
<i>¶ Are comin' out of this mouth, made by
this tongue, I'll tell you now my name ¶</i>

12:42.095 --> 12:44.095
<i>¶ My name is Young, but so you
think that it's your destiny ¶</i>

12:44.097 --> 12:46.698
<i>¶ To get the best of me, but I
suggest to be quiet, bro ¶</i>

12:46.700 --> 12:49.200
All: Whoa. <i>¶ Don't even try it from
the east and west of me, takin' it ¶</i>

12:49.202 --> 12:51.770
<i>¶ To never breakin' it to even shakin'
it, groovin' it to always movin' it ¶</i>

12:51.772 --> 12:54.205
<i>¶ 'Cuz I'm not fakin' it, pullin' out
rhymes like books off the shelf ¶</i>

12:54.207 --> 12:56.107
<i>¶ Born in England raised in
Hollis, taught to go for myself ¶</i>

12:56.109 --> 12:58.276
Aha! <i>¶ This is stone-cold
rhymin', no frills, no fluffs ¶</i>

12:58.278 --> 13:00.211
<i>¶ And it's no accident that these
rhymes sound tough ¶</i> All: Whoa!

13:00.213 --> 13:02.113
<i>¶ I'm goin' off, baby,
there's no turnin' back ¶</i>

13:02.115 --> 13:04.282
<i>¶ I'm on your TV, on your
album, cassette, and 8-track ¶</i>

13:04.284 --> 13:06.284
<i>¶ And when the show is finally
finished, I'll be takin' my bow ¶</i>

13:06.286 --> 13:07.886
<i>¶ My name is Young,
and, yo, I got know-how ¶</i>

13:07.888 --> 13:09.454
Wow, that was fun.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.956
Who knew that making candles
was a career possibility?

13:11.958 --> 13:13.758
Goodbye, architecture.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.960
And I got a kiss
from the midwife's assistant.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.562
You didn't get a kiss from her.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.564
You just asked her
where the bathroom was.

13:19.566 --> 13:20.732
We had a connection.

13:20.734 --> 13:22.267
Eddie, your mom is so fun.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.709
She makes my mom look like
straight-up garbage.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.105
Nobody tell my mom I said that.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.773
I was just wrapped up
in the moment.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.074
Yeah, Eddie. This field trip

13:30.076 --> 13:31.609
would've sucked
without your mom.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.077
I vote we all pool our money

13:33.079 --> 13:34.579
and buy her
some fancy chocolates.

13:34.581 --> 13:35.814
Sea salt or something.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.148
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

13:37.150 --> 13:38.483
Yeah, you guys are right.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.486
Hey, Mom. You were fun today.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.954
Oh, thank you, Eddie.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.923
I'm glad you and your friends
had a good time.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.257
You know, that Big Red...

13:46.259 --> 13:48.126
He has a real talent
for tanning meat.

13:48.128 --> 13:51.095
No, I mean, you were fun today.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.597
What is that all about?

13:52.599 --> 13:54.432
Are you jealous your friends
had fun with your mom?

13:54.434 --> 13:55.433
No.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.101
You were fun today,

13:57.103 --> 13:58.937
which means you've always
been capable of having fun.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.271
You just chose not to.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.639
Where was Fun Mom
when I wanted to keep

14:01.641 --> 14:03.508
that gecko that got into
Grandma's room?

14:03.510 --> 14:06.444
Or when I spilled my Slurpee on the
moving walkway in the airport?

14:06.446 --> 14:08.479
You could've been fun
this entire time.

14:08.481 --> 14:12.383
¶¶

14:14.020 --> 14:16.354
(telephone rings)

14:16.356 --> 14:18.690
(telephone beeps)

14:18.692 --> 14:21.192
Hello?

14:22.863 --> 14:25.463
Eddie got into a fight?

14:25.465 --> 14:26.965
Eddie got into a fight?

14:26.967 --> 14:28.032
Madeline, what did I tell you

14:28.034 --> 14:30.301
about keeping me in the loop?

14:30.303 --> 14:32.704
We had two vomits
and a sprained ankle,

14:32.706 --> 14:34.005
but no fights today.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.373
Really? <i>Two</i> vomits?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.675
It's taco day.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.210
Wait.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.646
If Eddie didn't
get into a fight, then who...

14:41.648 --> 14:44.048
Oh, no.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.085
(door opens)

14:48.355 --> 14:50.488
Oh, my God. What happened?

14:50.490 --> 14:51.990
(scoffs) You came so late

14:51.992 --> 14:53.892
that I missed a
Tony Little Gazelle Masterclass

14:53.894 --> 14:55.827
that I paid $45 for.

14:55.829 --> 14:58.062
You know that expression,
"Oh, if you work out,

14:58.064 --> 14:59.230
everything else will"? (Scoffs)

14:59.232 --> 15:01.699
Well, that is<i> not</i> true.

15:01.701 --> 15:05.103
Oh, and Emery was in a fight.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.245
You know, this isn't really
as bad as it seems.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.214
(chuckles) So you got punched.

15:16.216 --> 15:19.083
Everybody gets punched
at some point in their lives.

15:19.085 --> 15:22.420
Your mom got punched by a lady
at the yogurt shop last week.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.255
This is all your fault.
<i>My</i> fault?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.524
Instead of handling things
my own way,

15:26.526 --> 15:28.927
I took your advice,
and look what happened.

15:28.929 --> 15:32.096
Thanks a lot, Dad.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.765
(sighs)

15:33.767 --> 15:35.033
¶¶

15:35.035 --> 15:38.403
Yo, Evan, want to hear a secret?

15:38.405 --> 15:41.205
If it's that you wipe your hands
on my towel, I already know.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.941
How do you know about that?

15:42.943 --> 15:45.543
I know what a damp towel
feels like, Eddie.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.045
Whatever.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.246
I'm trying to tell you
a<i> real</i> secret.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.114
Mom is fun.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.549
That's not a secret.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.218
I've been telling you that
for<i> years.</i>

15:54.220 --> 15:55.753
Not your nerd version of fun.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.255
Like<i> actually</i> fun.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.791
Today at my field trip, she...

15:59.793 --> 16:02.894
Boys! What are you, waitresses
at a small-town diner?

16:02.896 --> 16:04.295
Stop chatting.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.396
Evan, finish your homework
in your room.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.131
Eddie, take out the trash.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.466
Okay, Mommy.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.970
Oh, cool, you're back
to being zero fun.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.572
Awesome. Maybe I'll
experience Fun Mom again

16:14.574 --> 16:16.741
in another 12 years.

16:16.743 --> 16:19.077
You think I don't want
to be Fun Mom?

16:19.079 --> 16:20.912
I would love to be Fun Mom.

16:20.914 --> 16:22.413
So then do it.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.748
Eddie, we had fun today

16:23.750 --> 16:25.583
because I didn't have to spend
every minute

16:25.585 --> 16:27.986
chasing after you
and nagging you.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.821
You think Fun Mom could get you
to do your homework

16:29.823 --> 16:31.956
<i>and</i> clean your room?

16:31.958 --> 16:33.257
No way.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.994
That's what<i> this</i> mom is for.

16:35.996 --> 16:38.930
This mom gets things done.

16:38.932 --> 16:41.833
No juice boxes until
you finish your homework.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.669
Your discipline
is the only reward I need.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.673
¶¶

16:48.675 --> 16:52.744
<i>(man speaking French)</i>

16:57.117 --> 16:58.783
Mom.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.785
I did the right thing, right?

17:00.787 --> 17:01.853
With Emery.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.058
What do you mean?

17:10.163 --> 17:11.896
I don't do that.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.302
Go, you 'Guanas!

17:18.304 --> 17:19.303
(all cheering)

17:19.305 --> 17:20.972
Go, you Barn Owls!

17:20.974 --> 17:22.040
(all cheering)

17:22.042 --> 17:23.041
Why do they call it

17:23.043 --> 17:24.375
women's basketball?

17:24.377 --> 17:26.477
It's just basketball,
am I right?

17:26.479 --> 17:27.712
(all cheering)

17:27.714 --> 17:30.181
Oh, my God, you're right.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.817
I hate women's basketball.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.053
(chuckles)

17:44.831 --> 17:46.697
Do you really think
I change who I am

17:46.699 --> 17:48.099
to get people to like me?

17:51.538 --> 17:55.073
(soft music playing)

17:55.075 --> 18:00.111
Now I understand the difference
between a movie and a film.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.749
Louis: How's that eye?

18:04.751 --> 18:05.917
It's okay.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.685
And don't worry... I told Mom

18:07.687 --> 18:09.554
that I got it from looking
too hard through my telescope.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.689
I think she was proud?

18:11.691 --> 18:16.861
I, uh, shouldn't have told you
to act like somebody you're not.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.696
You're your own person,
you're not ashamed of it,

18:18.698 --> 18:20.098
and that's your strength.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.732
Tell that
to the boys at my school.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.201
They're just too busy

18:23.203 --> 18:25.036
trying to figure out
who<i> they</i> are to notice.

18:25.038 --> 18:27.538
You may feel like you're falling
behind the curve right now,

18:27.540 --> 18:29.907
but trust me,
you are way ahead of it.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.075
¶¶

18:31.077 --> 18:33.111
Thanks, Dad.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.580
You know, maybe I just need
to change my tactics. Good.

18:35.582 --> 18:38.916
And deliver my poem in a
completely different way. Oh.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.952
I need to show Chad
and those other boys

18:40.954 --> 18:44.255
that you don't need to fight all
your battles with your fists.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.257
Sometimes you can use
the power of rhymed verse.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.425
Okay.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.060
Just be smart about it,
all right?

18:49.062 --> 18:50.561
Don't worry, Dad.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.762
That's who I am.

18:51.764 --> 18:54.098
¶¶

18:54.100 --> 18:57.235
You guys are missing
the gnome's funeral!

18:57.237 --> 18:59.504
I wonder
if there's a "La Chouffe 2."

19:00.473 --> 19:03.474
Eddie, up now. School.

19:04.911 --> 19:07.778
I heard what you said yesterday,
and I get it.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.081
Sometimes,
I<i> can</i> be a little much.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.249
<i>Sometimes?</i>

19:11.251 --> 19:13.451
More like... Not now.

19:13.453 --> 19:14.752
Yes, Mommy.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.654
I understand now
that the only reason

19:16.656 --> 19:18.289
why I have any fun around here

19:18.291 --> 19:19.790
is because
<i>you're</i> not having any,

19:19.792 --> 19:21.259
and that's not fair.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.927
That's why I got myself ready
this morning.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.428
I even packed my own lunch...

19:24.430 --> 19:26.297
Six Oreos and a tortilla.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.632
Thank you, Eddie.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.134
Even though I can tell
you didn't shower

19:30.136 --> 19:32.670
because you smell like
a pepperoni pizza,

19:32.672 --> 19:33.771
I'm proud of you.

19:33.773 --> 19:34.939
¶¶

19:34.941 --> 19:36.107
But that means

19:36.109 --> 19:37.875
we're 30 minutes ahead
of schedule.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.778
(Super Mario plays on TV)

19:40.780 --> 19:42.980
Am I the green janitor
or the red janitor?

19:42.982 --> 19:45.149
Neither, Mom.
You died five minutes ago.

19:45.151 --> 19:47.852
You've just been
pressing buttons for no reason.

19:49.322 --> 19:52.323
"And for who
but the flowers and the trees

19:52.325 --> 19:56.127
doth man speak
and sing his many whimsies."

19:56.129 --> 19:58.129
Poetry's for 'ginas.

19:58.131 --> 20:02.133
"And though a fist may crush
and sprain,

20:02.135 --> 20:05.636
there is no weapon
like the brain."

20:05.638 --> 20:10.141
This poem was written
by a clearly sensitive student.

20:10.143 --> 20:12.910
Our very own Chad.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.514
Lovely work, Chad. (Laughter)

20:16.516 --> 20:17.715
No.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.183
That wasn't me, I swear!

20:19.185 --> 20:20.985
No need to be bashful, Chad.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.553
It was a beautiful poem.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.388
(laughter)

20:25.525 --> 20:27.158
I really like that poem.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.392
Me, too.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.834
There's real power
in rhymed verse.

20:30.863 --> 20:33.130
Oops. I dropped my pencil.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.801
(deep voice) Let's go
spray-paint some turtles.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.009
¶¶

20:45.011 --> 20:46.344
Oh, hey, Louis.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.713
We just got
an amazing Danish film in...

20:48.715 --> 20:50.381
"Cosette and the Gentle Clown."

20:50.383 --> 20:52.850
It tells the story
of a young girl, Cosette,

20:52.852 --> 20:55.286
who leaves her oppressive
mining village to apprentice...

20:56.356 --> 20:58.222
I'm renting "Beethoven."

20:58.224 --> 21:00.858
I think maybe
you meant to get "Amadeus."

21:00.860 --> 21:02.026
That's over in...

21:02.028 --> 21:03.861
No, I didn't.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.763
I don't want to watch "Amadeus."

21:05.765 --> 21:08.032
"Amadeus" looks boring.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.735
Just like
<i>all</i> the movies you recommend.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.870
From now on, I'm only renting

21:12.872 --> 21:15.873
the kind of movies that<i> I</i> like.

21:15.875 --> 21:20.544
Movies about animals...
acting... crazy.

21:20.546 --> 21:22.113
Whatever, man.

21:22.115 --> 21:27.718
¶¶

21:27.720 --> 21:30.955
Yeah!
