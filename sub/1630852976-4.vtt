WEBVTT

00:06.807 --> 00:08.042
(crowd clamoring)

00:08.141 --> 00:10.444
Previously on
Star Trek: Picard...

00:10.544 --> 00:12.546
-What have you done?
-Show them a world
of their own making,

00:12.646 --> 00:14.215
and they ask you
what you've done.

00:14.315 --> 00:17.251
If we want to save the
future,
then we have to

00:17.351 --> 00:19.120
repair the past.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.357
-(cries out)
-Elnor!

00:23.457 --> 00:26.026
PICARD:
If we fail here,

00:26.127 --> 00:29.363
we fail Elnor and
everyone
in our homeworld.

00:33.734 --> 00:38.306
Laris, nothing has to
change.

00:40.608 --> 00:43.077
Move backward to go
forward.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.378
Shatter to mend.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.715
Admiral, I'm no longer
in command of this ship.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.484
The past is now.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.057
We're caught in Earth's
gravity.
I can't stop her!

00:59.827 --> 01:01.129
PICARD:
Give me nav control.

01:01.229 --> 01:02.796
-RIOS: Where are you
taking us?
-Home.

01:06.567 --> 01:09.803
The queen says that
there is
someone who can help
us.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.772
She called this individual
a "Watcher."

01:11.872 --> 01:14.475
You're saying if we find
them,
we can undo this
nightmare?

01:14.575 --> 01:18.078
It's probably some alien
species
that doesn't belong here.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.814
-It may not want to be
found.
-I'm coming for it.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.217
-You can't bring that with
you.
-This?

01:23.317 --> 01:25.219
Because we're 400 years
in the past.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.454
You have to look out
for butterflies.

01:26.554 --> 01:29.390
(crying out)

01:31.225 --> 01:32.793
JURATI:
Don't draw attention
to yourself.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.395
No hospitals, no
authorities,

01:34.495 --> 01:37.298
-no security checkpoints.
-Ow.

01:37.798 --> 01:41.235
-Hey!
-You're under arrest.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.206
I might be able to use
the ship as an interface.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.507
Absolutely not.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.709
I-I just need to get in
there,
fix her, and you can

01:49.643 --> 01:50.610
pull me out before
I'm fully assimilated.

01:50.711 --> 01:51.645
We fail without her.

01:51.745 --> 01:52.813
I can see so much.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.414
The Watcher. 15.

01:54.515 --> 01:55.649
-Yeah.
-(distorted): Don't.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.752
Computer, dictate the file
from the Borg Queen.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.454
COMPUTER:
3-4-dot-0...

02:00.554 --> 02:02.523
-4-8-8 North.
-Coordinates.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.524
To find the Watcher.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.625
But there's more, isn't
there?

02:04.725 --> 02:06.126
When it happens.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.195
I can almost feel it.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.128
You've impressed me.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.698
*

02:11.732 --> 02:13.734
*

02:21.475 --> 02:24.178
PICARD:
Rios? Do you read me?

02:27.715 --> 02:29.650
Raffi, do you copy?

02:29.750 --> 02:31.219
(static)

02:31.319 --> 02:32.620
Anybody?

02:34.588 --> 02:36.190
Whoa.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.825
What the hell happened
here?

02:37.925 --> 02:39.560
Nothing good.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.597
You sure
his signal pinged from
here?

02:43.697 --> 02:45.766
I know how to read a
tricorder.

02:48.236 --> 02:50.471
Why did Rios need a
hospital?

02:51.939 --> 02:53.674
RAFFI:
Rios?!

02:53.774 --> 02:54.942
Rios?

02:55.042 --> 02:56.410
Whoa, hey. Hey, I'm
sorry.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.911
Look, we're closed.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.614
If you need a doctor,
there's
another clinic two blocks
east.

03:01.482 --> 03:01.515
No, we don't need
medical assistance.

03:02.283 --> 03:02.316
We're looking for our
friend.

03:02.850 --> 03:03.951
Dark hair, scruffy.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.486
Yeah, he was here.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.222
The doctor patched him
up
before ICE officers
raided us.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.757
They arrested them both.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.725
I'm sorry. Look,

03:11.825 --> 03:13.727
Teresa's a citizen. You
know?
They'll probably just
detain her

03:13.827 --> 03:16.530
longer than they should
but
eventually they throw
her back.

03:16.630 --> 03:17.731
You know those
assholes.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.700
Yeah. I feel like I do.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.968
But your friend--

03:21.068 --> 03:22.303
I hope you find him soon.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.872
Before ICE makes sure
you never do.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.715
-Seven, Raffi, do you
read me?
-(static)

03:34.815 --> 03:37.518
Do you copy?!

03:38.686 --> 03:40.788
Rios, do you read me?

03:40.888 --> 03:43.391
It was a long shot
the comms would work.

03:43.491 --> 03:44.825
No relays.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.527
-(trilling, static stops)
-Let's...

03:46.627 --> 03:48.829
just hope that they're
not...

03:48.929 --> 03:51.332
Dead?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.269
Thank you, Doctor.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.971
You know...
(grunts)

03:58.071 --> 03:59.607
until the auto-repair
heats the ship,

04:00.874 --> 04:02.843
why don't we find you
somewhere
where we can light a fire.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.912
What if someone spots
La Sirena?

04:05.012 --> 04:08.282
The Confederation ships
seem
to be equipped with
upgrades.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.284
-(beep)
-Computer,

04:10.384 --> 04:12.686
engage cloaking device.

04:25.032 --> 04:25.999
PICARD:
Oh, dear.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.368
JURATI:
So Chateau Picard

04:27.468 --> 04:29.002
is abandoned in this era.

04:30.538 --> 04:33.374
Nearly a century at this
point.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.709
(rats squeaking)

04:35.808 --> 04:37.711
During the Second
World War,

04:37.811 --> 04:40.047
when the Nazis
occupied France,

04:40.147 --> 04:43.984
they used this house
as a base of operations.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.287
My ancestors

04:47.388 --> 04:51.859
only survived
by hiding in the tunnels
below.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.663
Where'd they go?

04:55.763 --> 04:57.331
England.

04:58.566 --> 05:01.535
But the chateau
remained
in the family.

05:04.772 --> 05:09.477
Although there were
various
caretakers keeping it up.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.012
It'll be generations

05:12.112 --> 05:15.082
before the Picards
reside here again.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.019
(owl hooting in distance)

05:26.894 --> 05:28.896
*

05:32.866 --> 05:34.034
Maman!

05:35.034 --> 05:36.604
Maman!

05:40.674 --> 05:42.009
Maman.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.379
You all right, mister?

05:48.081 --> 05:49.950
(chuckles softly)

05:50.050 --> 05:51.118
Just...

05:51.218 --> 05:53.954
having memories of...

05:54.054 --> 05:56.557
things that have yet to
occur.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.659
Maman.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.929
Maman.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.098
*

06:05.198 --> 06:06.934
YVETTE:
Computer,

06:07.034 --> 06:10.070
play "Non, je ne regrette
rien,"

06:10.170 --> 06:11.605
second verse.

06:11.705 --> 06:15.008
-Let's take a deep breath
and listen.
-* Avec leurs trémolos *

06:15.108 --> 06:17.611
-(inhaling deeply)
-* Balayé pour toujours *

06:17.711 --> 06:21.114
-(exhaling)
-* Je repars à zéro *

06:23.116 --> 06:25.553
-(exhales, gasps)
-* Non *

06:25.653 --> 06:27.020
-There.
-* Rien de rien *

06:27.120 --> 06:29.089
Fear's gone.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.658
-You're safe now.
-* Non *

06:30.758 --> 06:32.560
-I'm here.
-* Je ne regrette *

06:32.659 --> 06:34.662
* Rien *

06:34.762 --> 06:37.465
* Ni le bien *

06:37.565 --> 06:40.067
* Qu'on m'a fait *

06:40.167 --> 06:42.470
* Ni le mal *

06:42.570 --> 06:46.540
* Tout ça m'est bien
égal... *

06:47.908 --> 06:49.543
Where are you?

06:50.544 --> 06:52.145
Uh...

06:52.245 --> 06:55.449
lost in the past, I
suppose.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.586
In more ways than one.

07:01.121 --> 07:05.125
Agnes, we need to find
out
what else the Borg
Queen knows

07:05.225 --> 07:07.461
about the break in the
timeline,

07:07.561 --> 07:10.130
what else you stole
from her mind.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.165
And I think you need
rest.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.867
Thinking is my rest.

07:13.967 --> 07:17.070
Can't even comprehend
how relaxing calculus
can be.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.840
I will take your word for it.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.710
My mother used to play
Édith Piaf

07:22.810 --> 07:25.445
to me when I was young
to calm me down.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.448
I can just imagine a little
Picard wandering
around here

07:28.549 --> 07:29.617
saying...

07:29.717 --> 07:31.519
(deep voice):
"Milk. Chocolate.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.220
-Hot."
-(laughing)

07:33.320 --> 07:34.788
Let me guess, you were

07:35.956 --> 07:37.090
the skinny kid with
the endless book
collection.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.759
That was me.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.561
Oh, I need a drink.

07:40.661 --> 07:41.562
PICARD:
Ah.

07:41.662 --> 07:44.565
Agnes, what you need is
rest.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.233
Here we go.

07:46.332 --> 07:47.701
Pinot noir.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.704
You happen to have a
corkscrew
on you?

07:56.276 --> 07:57.878
Fascinating.

08:00.914 --> 08:04.184
You moved 15 beads
on the abacus.

08:04.284 --> 08:08.956
You chose the 15th
volume
of the Britannica.

08:09.056 --> 08:12.159
And a pinot noir.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.195
1915.

08:15.295 --> 08:19.600
Agnes, I think
that your marvelous mind

08:19.700 --> 08:21.535
is trying to tell us
something.

08:21.635 --> 08:24.805
Look at you, Dixon Hill.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.541
15. 15.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.610
It must be the other piece
of information I took

08:29.710 --> 08:30.778
from the Borg Queen's
mind.

08:30.878 --> 08:34.246
The last thing you said
before I disconnected
you--

08:34.347 --> 08:37.951
when is the timeline
changing?

08:38.051 --> 08:39.687
15 hours?

08:39.787 --> 08:41.621
That's too nonspecific.

08:41.722 --> 08:42.923
A date then.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.558
Did the ship's
chronometer

08:44.658 --> 08:46.960
ever show
precisely when we
landed?

08:47.060 --> 08:50.130
The 12th of April, 2024.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.565
Which, if we're right,
would mean...

08:51.665 --> 08:54.534
We have three days

08:54.635 --> 08:59.139
before the future
is changed irrevocably.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.976
*

09:32.172 --> 09:34.808
*

10:04.371 --> 10:06.373
*

10:33.701 --> 10:35.703
*

10:59.092 --> 11:01.394
* 35 years later
and nothing much has
changed *

11:01.494 --> 11:02.830
* Those in charge
are living large *

11:02.930 --> 11:04.998
* The rest are all
deranged *

11:05.098 --> 11:07.167
* 'Cause I still hate you *

11:07.267 --> 11:10.370
* Can't wait to
eviscerate you *

11:10.470 --> 11:11.905
-* 'Cause I *
-Hey.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.006
* Still hate *

11:13.106 --> 11:14.674
-* All of you *
-Hey.

11:15.776 --> 11:16.710
You mind stopping that
noise?

11:16.810 --> 11:18.111
* The temperatures are
rising *

11:18.211 --> 11:19.279
* The sea level as well *

11:19.379 --> 11:21.915
Yeah, okay! Fine!

11:22.015 --> 11:24.251
-(music stops)
-I just like that song.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.786
Okay, I'm sorry.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.888
Sorry. Apologies.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.124
We should have waited
in the other future.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.227
Until we had a real plan,
instead of jumping back
in time.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.996
We didn't have a lot of
runways.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.464
Whatever.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.433
Raffi,

11:40.533 --> 11:41.769
you lost someone.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.737
We're getting him back.

11:43.837 --> 11:44.972
And losing him was not

11:45.072 --> 11:46.740
-your fault.
-Just...

11:54.948 --> 11:56.449
JURATI:
The transporter
should be working.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.752
You sure about this?

11:58.852 --> 12:00.854
PICARD:
We need to figure out
what changes the
timeline,

12:00.954 --> 12:03.256
and we only have three
days.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.893
Considering
the precious little time
we have

12:05.993 --> 12:08.161
and that we haven't
been able
to reach the others,

12:08.261 --> 12:10.764
we must find the
Watcher.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.132
If the queen is right,

12:12.232 --> 12:14.267
the Watcher is the only
one
who can help us.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.335
I could come with you.

12:15.435 --> 12:16.469
No. We need you here.

12:16.569 --> 12:21.141
You must find a way
to boost the
communications

12:21.241 --> 12:23.343
and bring us home.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.781
I'm counting on you,
Agnes.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.183
We all are.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.252
Peachy.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.954
Have you met me in a
pinch?

12:34.054 --> 12:36.223
In fact, I have.

12:36.323 --> 12:39.827
Now, let's see where
the queen's coordinates
take me.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.028
All right, mister.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.830
I'm glad one of us

12:42.930 --> 12:44.531
-is confident.
-(chuckles softly)

12:44.631 --> 12:46.299
(beeping)

12:52.239 --> 12:55.042
-(sighs)
-Poor Agnes Jurati.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.476
Doomed to be the
afterthought,

12:56.576 --> 12:58.045
left behind again.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.947
Not to me.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.315
You're more than you let
on

13:02.415 --> 13:04.317
or that they can see.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.854
Smart, cunning

13:06.954 --> 13:10.924
and remarkably more
cruel
than I could have
predicted.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.325
Bravo.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.427
How am I cruel?

13:15.395 --> 13:17.364
Fixing me
just to take what you
need.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.967
Leaving me up here
powerless
yet now awake

13:20.067 --> 13:21.902
-to feel it.
-All right.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.504
Well, have a good night
plotting

13:24.604 --> 13:26.239
or whatever it is
Borg Queens do.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.108
You felt it, too.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.176
Didn't you?

13:30.343 --> 13:34.447
That thing for what we
Borg have
so very many words:

13:34.547 --> 13:37.017
assimilation.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.019
Cooperation.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.955
Connection.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.024
*

13:51.064 --> 13:52.265
-(indistinct chatter)
-(horns honking in
distance)

13:52.365 --> 13:53.901
(siren wailing)

13:54.001 --> 13:55.903
(engine rumbling)

14:21.294 --> 14:23.463
-(door opens, bell jingles)
-* Uh-huh *

14:25.398 --> 14:27.267
-(door closes)
-* Mm-hmm *

14:28.668 --> 14:30.570
* Uh-huh *

14:32.439 --> 14:34.107
* Mm-hmm *

14:39.612 --> 14:42.349
* I was lost *

14:42.449 --> 14:43.951
* In a place *

14:44.051 --> 14:46.954
* Where my soul felt no
desire *

14:47.054 --> 14:49.089
* I was lost *

14:49.189 --> 14:53.293
* And I thought I lost it
all *

14:54.561 --> 14:56.296
* Here you are *

14:56.396 --> 14:58.065
* In my place *

14:58.165 --> 15:01.969
* And my heart is set on
fire *

15:02.069 --> 15:03.136
-* Here you are... *
-GUINAN: No.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.504
Put it back.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.439
Bar's closed.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.243
Guinan.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.179
Yeah?

15:14.714 --> 15:16.116
Want some advice?

15:16.216 --> 15:17.517
March yourself back out
that door

15:18.851 --> 15:21.288
and I won't have to have
you
on my or Luna's
conscience.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.290
Luna?

15:23.390 --> 15:25.092
-GUINAN: Hey, Luna.
-(barks)

15:26.326 --> 15:27.560
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.062
Hey.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.530
Hello, girl.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.698
Stay.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.067
Good girl.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.168
My apologies.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.105
Ten Forward is always
open,
I thought.

15:38.205 --> 15:39.306
If you're here to drink,

15:39.406 --> 15:40.173
you're late.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.542
You're here to loot,
you're early.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.412
Today is closing day.

15:45.512 --> 15:46.980
-Closing for...?
-Ever.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.448
That's it. Out.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.151
(sighs)

15:51.251 --> 15:53.653
You're a lot older
than my usual thieves.

15:53.753 --> 15:54.988
* So good... *

15:55.088 --> 15:57.690
Haven't settled
into retirement yet?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.659
Believe me, I am trying.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.628
But it turns out that, uh,

16:01.728 --> 16:06.166
afternoon naps and
jigsaw
puzzles are not quite my
speed.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.167
Guinan,

16:07.267 --> 16:09.602
I was told to come here.

16:09.702 --> 16:10.603
And I believe--

16:10.703 --> 16:12.739
I hope--

16:12.839 --> 16:14.607
that you can help me.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.743
I don't know you.
I don't want to know you.

16:16.843 --> 16:19.312
-(quietly): Yeah.
-And I don't help.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.514
There is something
very important

16:21.614 --> 16:23.150
that I have to tell you,

16:23.250 --> 16:26.753
and you know
how valuable listening
can be.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.588
As an El-Aurian.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.465
Who the hell are you,
old man?

16:47.107 --> 16:48.040
(siren wailing in distance)

16:48.141 --> 16:49.076
STAUSS:
Crystal Ball?

16:49.176 --> 16:51.078
Is that, like,
a stage name or
something?

16:51.178 --> 16:52.312
Cristobal.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.181
He was arrested
along with a doctor.

16:54.281 --> 16:55.515
-Can't you find him?
-Look around.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.650
I got intake. I got
overflow.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.586
I got transfers waiting
to happen.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.089
If they took your friend,
he ain't in the system yet.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.156
Then where is he?

17:03.256 --> 17:04.757
Processing. How should
I know?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.159
Goddamn it!

17:07.160 --> 17:08.161
You're law enforcement
for this city, right?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.230
Why else would I be
here?

17:11.298 --> 17:14.201
Listen, my friend was
taken
by ICE officers.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.367
You must know
something.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.369
You can't just kidnap
people.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.672
Okay, we're just going to
back
away from your personal
space

17:19.771 --> 17:20.673
and wait over there.

17:20.772 --> 17:22.409
You are doing a great
job.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.675
Thank you
for serving the public.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.145
(groans)
I hate everything.

17:25.244 --> 17:27.079
-But you hide it so well.
-(huffs)

17:29.582 --> 17:30.683
(sighs)

17:31.684 --> 17:33.353
Piece of advice?

17:34.354 --> 17:37.124
LAPD won't have ICE
detainees
in their system.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.426
You want Immigration
and Customs
Enforcement.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.828
-Look, you're
in the wrong place.
-(groans softly)

17:41.928 --> 17:43.363
Not that it makes
any difference,

17:43.463 --> 17:44.264
'cause if you don't get
to...

17:44.364 --> 17:46.233
Crystal Ball
before he's transferred,

17:46.333 --> 17:47.700
gone.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.569
No trial. No paper trail.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.144
(lock buzzes)

17:57.244 --> 18:00.213
I pledge allegiance
to the flag...

18:06.586 --> 18:08.255
(creaking)

18:09.256 --> 18:10.357
You.

18:11.558 --> 18:12.559
I need your Juan
Hancock
on these transfer papers.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.195
Got a bus seat
with your name on it.

18:20.167 --> 18:22.735
Just sign it.

18:27.674 --> 18:30.243
You eyeballing me,
asshole?

18:30.343 --> 18:31.678
The hell is wrong with
you guys?

18:31.778 --> 18:33.180
Slap on a badge,
put on a uniform,

18:34.314 --> 18:34.681
you think you can treat
people
this way? Show...

18:35.315 --> 18:36.416
-(clicking)
-(groans)

18:37.750 --> 18:39.519
(groaning, shuddering)

18:41.321 --> 18:43.423
(groans)

18:46.859 --> 18:47.794
(groans softly)

18:47.894 --> 18:49.362
Let's go.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.900
(door creaking open)

18:54.000 --> 18:56.803
(panting)

18:56.903 --> 18:59.406
(door creaking shut)

18:59.506 --> 19:01.474
(panting)

19:03.910 --> 19:06.179
Why does the past hurt
so much?

19:06.279 --> 19:08.615
Dislocate the other hand,
I'm gonna start charging.

19:08.715 --> 19:09.882
Are you all right?

19:09.982 --> 19:10.917
I'm fine.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.319
Lunatic.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.786
Why didn't you run?

19:13.886 --> 19:15.422
I did. I just then...

19:15.522 --> 19:17.290
also chose to run back.

19:17.390 --> 19:20.293
Well, good job.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.563
I'm still trying to work out
the brave-or-stupid
conundrum.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.566
If you figure it out,
can you give my late
mother

19:26.666 --> 19:27.834
a call?
(chuckles softly)

19:29.001 --> 19:30.737
Who are you, Cristobal?

19:32.472 --> 19:34.507
I'm just a...

19:34.607 --> 19:36.709
Good Samaritan

19:36.809 --> 19:38.378
passing through.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.549
GUINAN:
Long as I've lived
on this planet,

19:42.649 --> 19:44.884
I can count on one hand

19:44.984 --> 19:48.421
number of times
I've been called...

19:48.521 --> 19:50.690
El-Aurian.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.393
Who are you?

19:54.561 --> 19:56.363
Where are you from?

19:56.463 --> 19:57.364
France.

19:57.464 --> 19:58.431
No.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.699
Not just France.

20:00.833 --> 20:01.868
Anyone who comes
around
knowing where I'm from,

20:01.968 --> 20:04.837
they're not from
anywhere
remotely around here.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.673
Planetarily speaking.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.808
(Luna whining)

20:08.908 --> 20:10.910
You're a beautiful girl.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.480
Good girl.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.981
Huh.

20:15.081 --> 20:18.385
She doesn't usually take
to strangers.

20:18.485 --> 20:20.553
Because she knows
I'm not a threat.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.329
Whatever, man.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.564
Stay. Go.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.433
I'm locking the doors for
good
either way.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.302
The fact that you're
leaving

20:35.402 --> 20:38.305
at the moment that I find
you

20:38.405 --> 20:41.641
proves to me that I have
come
to the right place.

20:41.741 --> 20:45.712
I was told I had three
days
to stop something

20:45.812 --> 20:48.415
very... critical from
happening.

20:48.515 --> 20:50.917
Good luck with that.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.886
I was given coordinates.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.755
-To this place.
-(door opens, bell jingles)

20:55.855 --> 20:57.457
To find a Watcher.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.459
-(door closes)
-I suspect

20:59.559 --> 21:01.628
that I've already found
one.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.496
-I-I'm not...
-Guinan?

21:04.897 --> 21:06.733
Am I early?

21:10.570 --> 21:11.938
Luna.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.475
-Come on now, girl.
-(whining)

21:20.713 --> 21:23.583
You go home
with your Uncle Dale.

21:23.683 --> 21:26.719
He'll take good care of
you.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.356
(chuckles)

21:29.456 --> 21:31.824
-(sniffles)
-Come here, baby.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.066
Come on, baby.

21:41.734 --> 21:44.337
-(chuckles softly)
-(departing footsteps)

21:44.437 --> 21:47.674
-This place is
a pressure cooker.
-(door opens, bell jingles)

21:48.941 --> 21:51.544
-(door closes)
-You know they're
actually killing the
planet?

21:52.545 --> 21:55.415
Truth is
whatever you want it to
be.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.417
Facts aren't even facts
anymore.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.819
A few folks have
enough resources

21:59.919 --> 22:03.790
to fix all the problems
for the rest, but they
won't.

22:03.890 --> 22:07.093
Because their greatest
fear
is having less.

22:08.495 --> 22:13.633
They got one tiny ball
in the entire galaxy,

22:13.733 --> 22:16.803
and all this species
wants to do
is fight.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.671
(sniffles)

22:18.771 --> 22:20.807
I've given them long
enough.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.008
(echoing):
It's not too late.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.710
PICARD:
It's not too late.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.479
The problem isn't time.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.382
-GUINAN: It's not too
late.
-PICARD: It's not.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.450
GUINAN:
It's not time.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.784
-It's you.
-It's you.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.653
GUINAN:
It's not too late.

22:34.887 --> 22:37.390
(retching)

22:39.125 --> 22:40.693
-(coughing)
-What you're
experiencing,

22:40.793 --> 22:43.763
it's because I'm repeating
to you now

22:43.863 --> 22:47.500
words you will say back
to me
in the future.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.669
You told me about it once

22:49.769 --> 22:51.438
many tomorrows ago.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.506
It's-it's called "Af..."

22:53.606 --> 22:55.508
-Af-something.
-Af-kelt.

22:55.608 --> 22:56.576
(sniffles)

22:56.676 --> 22:57.844
Time sickness.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.447
A uniquely El-Aurian
condition

23:00.547 --> 23:04.851
that occurs only when
the timeline has been
affected.

23:04.951 --> 23:06.786
Doesn't matter to me,
old man.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.521
Once I leave, I'll be fine.

23:08.621 --> 23:12.459
Distance offers no
protection
from time.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.161
This wrong must be
righted,

23:15.261 --> 23:17.997
something which only
you

23:18.097 --> 23:20.600
can help me do.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.102
*

23:28.140 --> 23:30.777
(siren wailing in distance)

23:30.877 --> 23:33.145
-What are we doing?
-Finding Rios.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.114
In the parking lot?

23:35.214 --> 23:36.516
We need to find out
where they're
disappearing

23:36.616 --> 23:37.717
people like him.

23:37.817 --> 23:41.120
So we follow the trail
of suffering like
breadcrumbs.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.424
Okay, just so I'm clear,
are you suggesting we
steal

23:45.525 --> 23:47.627
a vehicle from the same
people

23:47.727 --> 23:49.762
whose job it is
to prosecute theft?

23:49.862 --> 23:53.165
We need a way to find
Rios and
get back to fixing the
timeline.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.734
-See, my idea...
-Mm.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.969
is to steal the computer
inside.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.471
Better?

23:58.571 --> 24:00.973
Not better. Not better.

24:01.073 --> 24:02.809
Raffi, what the hell
happened
to no phasers?

24:03.876 --> 24:06.112
I have no idea
how this got here.

24:06.212 --> 24:08.047
Okay, Raffi, right now,
your brains

24:08.147 --> 24:10.049
are in your fists.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.652
We're not doing Rios
any good
if we're locked up with
him.

24:17.023 --> 24:20.560
You're not gonna get
very far
without power, are you?

24:20.660 --> 24:22.128
(engine starts)

24:22.228 --> 24:25.665
So you could do that, but
you couldn't unlock the
door?

24:25.765 --> 24:27.700
No, I could've,
but that was way more
fun.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.701
I thought that guy said

24:28.801 --> 24:30.903
that Rios wouldn't be
in the same system.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.839
Well, systems
in the 21st century are
linked.

24:32.939 --> 24:35.542
A little navigating,
and I give you...

24:35.642 --> 24:37.844
Immigration and
Customs, baby.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.846
What we want are
"Arrests."

24:39.946 --> 24:42.582
We're looking
for a male Hispanic,

24:42.682 --> 24:43.816
a female Hispanic.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.218
My God. There are so
many.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.587
OFFICER:
What happened back
there?

24:47.687 --> 24:49.822
Damn it, Raffi.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.896
-Come on. Come on,
come on.
-No, I-I got it.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.599
ICE intakes are routed
to a processing center

24:59.699 --> 25:01.133
25 miles northwest of
here.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.836
Musiker to Sirena. Do
you copy?

25:03.936 --> 25:05.972
-Picard?
-I think we've established
that communicators

25:06.072 --> 25:07.940
don't work at long
distance
in this century.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.776
JURATI:
Raffi, is that you?

25:09.876 --> 25:11.711
Oh, I'm here.
Are you with Picard?

25:11.811 --> 25:13.780
RAFFI:
Picard?
No, we're going after
Rios.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.582
Rios isn't with you?

25:15.682 --> 25:18.250
He's in a detention
facility
in a place called Castaic.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.720
-So things are going well.
-I'm sending you
the coordinates.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.188
We need help getting
there.

25:22.288 --> 25:24.691
All right,
bringing transporter
online.

25:24.791 --> 25:27.226
Damn it.
The system's down
again.

25:27.326 --> 25:28.561
It dropped back
into self-repair mode.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.196
I need some time.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.098
We don't have time.
Where's Picard?

25:32.198 --> 25:33.866
I don't know,
and I can't make contact,

25:33.966 --> 25:35.534
even though I boosted
the communicators.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.870
Okay. We're going after
Rios
the old-fashioned way.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.607
Here, put that on.
Just click it.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.274
-You want me to drive?
-Well, you have a better
idea?

25:42.374 --> 25:45.244
-(scoffs)
-What? Oh.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.914
You can pilot a starship
but you can't drive a...

25:48.014 --> 25:50.617
(tires screeching)

25:50.717 --> 25:52.184
(whoops)
All right.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.553
You're doing great.

25:55.588 --> 25:56.555
You're doing great.
Just-just e-easy does it.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.058
-Easy does it. (whoops)
-(shouts)

25:59.158 --> 26:01.994
Try to not draw
so much attention to us.

26:02.094 --> 26:04.030
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.833
Okay, well,
nobody's gonna notice
that.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.801
What? You wanted out,
we're out.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.304
-(tires screeching)
-(horns honking)

26:12.404 --> 26:14.306
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa.
One way, one way!

26:14.406 --> 26:16.108
(horns honking)

26:16.208 --> 26:17.276
DISPATCHER:
All units, be advised,

26:17.376 --> 26:18.745
stolen police vehicle
headed north

26:18.845 --> 26:20.579
on Adams Street.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.581
(horns honking)

26:22.682 --> 26:24.617
I'm pretty sure we can't
reach Rios if we're
roadkill.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.152
All right...
give me a little slack
here.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.888
-This thing's an antique.
-Oh, you're kidding me.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.356
Castaic's an hour away?

26:30.456 --> 26:31.658
(tires screech)

26:31.758 --> 26:33.159
Jurati, give me some
good news.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.995
Shit. I'm working on it,
you guys, I swear.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.668
Seven, just get around
them.
Get around them.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.770
-You think I'm not trying?
-The bus was faster.

26:43.870 --> 26:44.904
All right, maybe you
should
get back on it.

26:48.741 --> 26:51.678
Uh, truck? Truck. Truck!

26:51.778 --> 26:53.612
(tires screeching)

26:57.249 --> 27:00.119
(horn honking)

27:00.219 --> 27:01.854
Just-just go back that
way.
That way.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.323
Okay, how about you
drive and
I hold the map? How
about that?

27:05.091 --> 27:05.792
You know what?
You two really need

27:06.558 --> 27:07.326
to work on your
communication.

27:08.227 --> 27:08.260
It's the cornerstone
of every good...

27:09.128 --> 27:09.829
-BOTH: Jurati.
-See? There you go.

27:10.697 --> 27:10.730
-Now you're in sync.
-RAFFI: Look,

27:11.497 --> 27:12.832
just get the transporter
up.

27:13.766 --> 27:14.133
Even if you can't beam
us
to Castaic,

27:15.101 --> 27:16.202
we'll still need an exit
when we find Rios.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.070
Seriously, guys,
I need more time.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.639
-How much?
-Um-- I-- A day?

27:20.740 --> 27:22.675
A day? We barely have
an hour.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.210
Oh, Agnes.

27:28.014 --> 27:30.282
Stand by. I might know
someone who can help.

27:34.921 --> 27:37.056
-(engine revs)
-(horn honks)

27:38.490 --> 27:40.659
So let me see if I got this.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.830
You're from some
redacted years
in the future,

27:43.930 --> 27:45.965
but time's been altered.

27:46.065 --> 27:51.170
So now one future is A-
OK
and the other's hell on
Earth.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.906
-Yeah.
-And you can babble all
that,

27:54.006 --> 27:56.242
but you can't even tell
me
your name?

27:56.342 --> 27:59.846
Well, if I say more,
I risk compromising your
path.

27:59.946 --> 28:01.180
Might've thought of that
before

28:01.280 --> 28:02.882
you started harassing me
in my bar.

28:02.982 --> 28:06.452
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
I-I had no choice.

28:06.552 --> 28:11.157
Whatever you are
watching over,
that y-you're about to
abandon,

28:11.257 --> 28:14.093
it is vital to the future
of humanity.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.195
I'm no Watcher.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.330
And humanity?

28:18.430 --> 28:19.899
(scoffs)

28:19.999 --> 28:21.968
(dog barking in distance)

28:24.370 --> 28:28.140
Humankind will change.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.142
-You must be patient.
-You know who has

28:30.242 --> 28:32.812
the luxury of patience
here?

28:32.912 --> 28:36.415
Someone who looks like
you
and not like me.

28:38.117 --> 28:41.220
This world had more
potential
than I had ever imagined.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.122
MAN:
Ah, this is great.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.291
You can just set those
on the table. Thank you.

28:45.391 --> 28:48.460
But the hatred here?
It never ends.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.830
It just swaps clothes.

28:50.930 --> 28:54.133
This century? It took off
a hood and put on a suit.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.836
You say change is
coming?

28:56.936 --> 28:58.771
Well, it's too damn slow.

28:58.871 --> 29:00.773
And the cost way too
high.

29:00.873 --> 29:04.944
And being forced
to watch it... hurts.

29:05.044 --> 29:07.179
History's darkest
moments

29:07.279 --> 29:10.783
can be a tipping point
for change.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.952
There's still good here.

29:13.052 --> 29:15.922
Trust me, it ain't tipping
soon.

29:16.022 --> 29:19.258
And I've been on this
planet
a lot longer than you.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.227
Then why not a few
more days?

29:21.327 --> 29:23.262
Stay.

29:23.362 --> 29:27.800
Help me to understand
what's
been changed in this
timeline.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.906
I didn't not sleep for six
years
in med school

29:34.006 --> 29:35.441
so I could watch
my neighbors die

29:35.541 --> 29:37.877
because they're too
afraid
to go to a hospital.

29:37.977 --> 29:40.512
That's why you started
the clinic?

29:40.612 --> 29:42.781
I started the clinic
'cause I'm a control
freak.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.917
Where I come from,
you'd be a hero.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.954
Yeah? Where's that?

29:50.256 --> 29:53.125
Do you even know
what's gonna happen to
you?

29:54.426 --> 29:57.063
No. Do you?

29:57.163 --> 30:00.299
No. Not sure.

30:00.399 --> 30:01.533
It's my second time.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.070
I hate being in here.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.472
I start out with a pretty
healthy fear of authority.

30:08.474 --> 30:11.810
Clearly not when it gets
in the way of helping
people.

30:11.911 --> 30:14.914
Pure selfishness.
I need to be needed.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.483
How's the hand?

30:18.584 --> 30:19.952
You're good.

30:20.052 --> 30:22.088
(door creaking open)

30:23.655 --> 30:25.291
That the one who tased
you?

30:25.391 --> 30:28.260
Yep. Face like a Ferengi.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.196
What the hell's a
Ferengi?

30:30.296 --> 30:32.198
MORRIS:
Teresa Ramirez.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.300
Paperwork came
through.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.302
Uber's waiting.

30:37.469 --> 30:38.871
-Look, I-I would like
to help you...
-No, go on.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.206
Go on. Please.
You've done enough

30:40.306 --> 30:41.540
for me already, so thank
you.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.609
If you ever need
anything.

30:49.115 --> 30:51.984
MORRIS:
Aw, don't cry, Juan.

30:52.084 --> 30:55.487
You're in luck.
I got you a seat on that
bus.

30:55.587 --> 30:57.523
I mean, unless, of
course,
you've decided

30:57.623 --> 31:02.394
to provide your name
and proof of citizenship.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.396
All right.

31:04.496 --> 31:07.333
My name is Cristobal
Rios.

31:07.433 --> 31:10.569
You can call me Chris,
Rios.
Good either way.

31:10.669 --> 31:13.205
Occupation?

31:14.240 --> 31:15.908
Captain.

31:16.008 --> 31:18.544
Of the USS Stargazer.
You wouldn't know it.

31:18.644 --> 31:20.913
It's a starship
from the year 2400.

31:21.013 --> 31:23.415
I'm on an ongoing
mission
to explore strange new
worlds,

31:23.515 --> 31:24.917
seek out new life
and civilizations, but
instead

31:26.018 --> 31:27.153
I'm stuck back in a
particularly
primitive past--

31:28.154 --> 31:29.121
no offense--
trying to correct the
timeline

31:29.922 --> 31:30.589
so I can, you know...
(whistles)

31:30.689 --> 31:32.258
With who, you ask?

31:33.559 --> 31:34.893
A ragtag group of misfits
including one cybernetic
queen

31:35.995 --> 31:37.229
that I'm fairly certain
is just in it to wipe out

31:37.329 --> 31:39.531
all of humanity
with her old cohort,

31:39.631 --> 31:42.501
a crusty old admiral who,
if I understand it
correctly,

31:42.601 --> 31:45.371
is now a flesh and blood
robot.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.073
I-I, you know, I can't be
sure,

31:47.173 --> 31:49.541
'cause nobody
can explain it to me.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.144
(chuckles)

31:53.312 --> 31:54.913
(laughs)

31:58.184 --> 32:00.052
(exhales)

32:06.525 --> 32:08.160
-(horns honking)
-(tires screeching)

32:11.130 --> 32:13.465
Uh, I think, uh,
t-take a right up here.
(grunts)

32:13.565 --> 32:14.566
SEVEN OF NINE:
I just want to say,

32:14.666 --> 32:15.968
I am not the worst driver
here.

32:16.068 --> 32:18.137
-Well...
-(horn honking)

32:18.237 --> 32:19.238
Wait, what does
a yellow light mean?

32:19.338 --> 32:20.239
Go faster.

32:20.339 --> 32:21.974
No, red means stop.

32:22.074 --> 32:23.342
Red means stop. Red
means stop!

32:23.442 --> 32:25.211
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop!
(shouts)

32:25.311 --> 32:27.013
(tires screeching)

32:27.113 --> 32:28.614
Uh, can you stop?

32:28.714 --> 32:30.949
If I kill somebody,
this is on you.

32:31.050 --> 32:33.085
Well, maybe you could
try
not aiming for them.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.023
I think you're getting
the hang of it.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.361
MAN:
Hurry up. Keep moving.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.442
Take a seat.

32:58.477 --> 33:01.047
I'm sorry to say that the
end
of the line's gonna be

33:01.147 --> 33:03.715
the end of life as you
know it.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.517
Adios, Captain.

33:09.188 --> 33:11.157
(lock clicks)

33:12.458 --> 33:14.393
MAN:
Transport is set.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.662
BORG QUEEN:
Agnes P. Jurati.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.530
You've the quickened
flush
of a woman

33:18.630 --> 33:21.400
with much to ask
yet no time to ask it.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.001
There are a number of
systems

33:23.102 --> 33:24.503
that are still down
after our, uh...

33:24.603 --> 33:26.672
Entwinement, shall we
say?

33:26.772 --> 33:30.309
Some of the systems
are recalibrating too
slowly.

33:30.409 --> 33:33.312
Which systems concern
you
the most? Propulsion?
Cloaking?

33:33.412 --> 33:36.014
No, I-I know you were
listening.
I need the transporters.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.516
Cloaking doesn't matter
right now.

33:38.884 --> 33:40.719
Says the woman who
won't meet
my gaze for fear of
being seen.

33:40.819 --> 33:44.123
To be in plain view
and yet still unafraid,

33:44.223 --> 33:47.259
there's great strength in
that.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.395
Well, I'm sure it helps
when
you have an army
behind you.

33:49.495 --> 33:52.331
It's how you get the army
to follow you, my dear,

33:52.431 --> 33:54.800
how you teach the choir
to sing.

33:54.900 --> 33:58.737
-Look, about the
transporter...
-Don't politely demure
yourself.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.672
Convince me.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.577
My friends are in trouble.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.446
I really need the
transporters
fully functioning,

34:07.546 --> 34:09.781
and you can think faster
than I can type.

34:09.880 --> 34:13.284
So, please, can I trust
you
to help?

34:13.385 --> 34:17.489
Beware the species that
has
not yet purged that word.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.658
They're simply begging
to be conquered.

34:19.757 --> 34:20.826
"Help"?

34:20.926 --> 34:22.561
"Trust."

34:22.661 --> 34:24.496
It's a strange thing to say
to somebody

34:24.596 --> 34:26.364
you're trying to get
to trust you.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.600
Yet more believable than if
I told you that you could.

34:28.699 --> 34:31.503
"Betrayal" is just an
anagram
for "believe me."

34:31.603 --> 34:33.371
That's not even...

34:33.472 --> 34:35.373
(sighs)
God. Poetry, dear.

34:35.474 --> 34:36.708
Flair.

34:36.808 --> 34:39.110
You are like
the brightest peacock,

34:39.210 --> 34:41.447
yet still so afraid to shine.

34:41.547 --> 34:46.518
And that, dear Agnes, is
why
you are so frequently
alone.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.721
You want to talk
about being alone?

34:49.821 --> 34:50.922
Look at you. You're
disconnected from the
hive.

34:51.022 --> 34:53.659
You're trying to have
a slow conversation with
me

34:53.759 --> 34:55.661
just to have someone to
talk to.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.763
If my friends crash
or get captured,

34:57.863 --> 34:59.598
how chatty do you think
I'm gonna be then?

35:01.367 --> 35:04.236
Help now and what do I
get?

35:05.437 --> 35:07.139
Me.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.276
I got a lot of your...

35:10.376 --> 35:13.412
thoughts still swimming
around
in my head after our, you
know.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.481
You hate being alone
just as much as I do.

35:15.581 --> 35:16.648
So how about it?

35:16.748 --> 35:17.816
You and I trade sad sack
stories

35:17.916 --> 35:20.286
in between
pressing catastrophes.

35:30.229 --> 35:31.330
-(device chimes)
-RAFFI: Shit.

35:31.430 --> 35:32.664
Rios's file just updated.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.366
-He's being moved,
-What? Where?

35:34.466 --> 35:36.535
Uh, it's to a "sanctuary
district" on the border?

35:36.635 --> 35:38.370
Like he's being
disappeared.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.806
-Raffi, if we lose him
now...
-I know, I know.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.208
Damn it.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.875
Hey, hang on. Okay, I
found him.

35:43.975 --> 35:47.479
Uh, he's on ICE transfer
bus
number 735.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.415
GPS transponder says
he's on Highway 14...

35:49.515 --> 35:50.916
-(sirens wailing)
-Oh, oh, n-n-n-n-no, no.

35:51.016 --> 35:52.318
(tires screeching)

35:54.486 --> 35:56.455
Jurati,
the cops are all over us.

35:56.555 --> 35:57.856
Tell me that you have
the transporter up.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.725
Yes. Yes, we're almost
good
to go.

35:59.825 --> 36:02.261
Not bad, huh?
I just walked right over...

36:02.361 --> 36:04.230
Agnes! Agnes, focus.
No time to explain.

36:04.330 --> 36:05.897
All right, I'm sending you
our coordinates.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.499
Beam us there now.

36:07.599 --> 36:10.302
Okay, uh, just a second.
Getting them.

36:10.402 --> 36:13.305
Seven, can you buy us
some time?

36:13.405 --> 36:16.174
-(sirens wailing)
-(tires screeching)

36:22.414 --> 36:24.516
JURATI:
Okay, now I'm gonna
ask you
to do something

36:24.616 --> 36:26.918
totally counterintuitive,
okay?
I need you to hit the
brakes.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.388
What? The authorities
are right behind us.

36:29.488 --> 36:30.722
Seven, trust me.

36:33.459 --> 36:34.560
(tires screeching)

36:37.529 --> 36:38.697
Oh...

36:40.432 --> 36:41.933
OFFICER:
Get out of the car!

36:42.033 --> 36:43.168
Get out now!

36:43.269 --> 36:46.538
DISPATCHER: 1031.
Requesting backup at
Broadway.

36:46.638 --> 36:49.475
All other units,
cordon off 11th Avenue.

36:49.575 --> 36:52.644
OFFICER:
1014. Copy that.
Barricading Olive and
12th.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.713
Setting up a perimeter.

37:02.288 --> 37:03.722
JURATI:
Sorry, guys, the
transporter

37:03.822 --> 37:05.357
still can't handle
moving targets.

37:06.658 --> 37:07.393
Are you guys alive?
Please,
please tell me you're
alive.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.428
We're alive, I think.

37:09.528 --> 37:10.929
(exhales)

37:14.500 --> 37:16.234
I got a lock on the bus's
GPS.

37:17.936 --> 37:20.238
Whoa. Rios is coming
fast.

37:22.774 --> 37:25.243
-So we hijack it.
-In broad daylight.

37:25.344 --> 37:26.478
-Without butterflies.
-Without getting
ourselves killed.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.779
Or Rios.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.648
Or anyone else.

37:29.748 --> 37:30.882
Exactly.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.889
You're welcome.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.527
Agnes?

37:41.627 --> 37:43.028
I limited your access
again.

37:43.128 --> 37:44.996
Agnes.

37:47.599 --> 37:48.867
Agnes!

37:48.967 --> 37:52.304
Well, donations are
done,
which means so am I.

37:52.404 --> 37:53.605
So long, old man.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.807
Guinan, please. Wait.

37:55.907 --> 37:58.777
-In three days...
-Future destroyed, I got it.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.579
But I don't get involved.

38:00.679 --> 38:03.349
-I listen.
-But you must know
something.

38:03.449 --> 38:04.816
They sent me to you.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.985
I am not your Watcher!

38:10.489 --> 38:12.891
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.629
I'm not it.

38:18.630 --> 38:22.033
My name is Jean-Luc
Picard.

38:26.037 --> 38:27.773
400 years from now,

38:27.873 --> 38:32.878
you will be my oldest
and dearest friend.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.847
Picard, huh?

38:36.882 --> 38:38.350
Yes.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.053
Shit.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.322
Get in.

38:50.696 --> 38:53.965
You're looking for a
Supervisor,
otherwise known as a
Watcher.

38:54.065 --> 38:55.701
They're peppered
through the galaxy,

38:55.801 --> 38:58.537
assigned to protect the
destiny
of certain individuals.

38:58.637 --> 39:01.573
Assigned by whom?
And what do you mean
by destiny?

39:01.673 --> 39:03.875
You know,
it's all kinds of vague.

39:03.975 --> 39:05.877
They're not big
explainers.

39:05.977 --> 39:09.648
They see themselves
as kind of guardian
angels.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.650
No humility problem
there.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.520
Anyway, I-I can get you
a face-to-face.

39:14.620 --> 39:15.687
Sort of.

39:15.787 --> 39:18.056
Uh, what do you mean,
"sort of"?

39:18.156 --> 39:20.826
Let's just say I suspect

39:20.926 --> 39:24.362
she's very much gonna
want
to meet you.

39:24.463 --> 39:27.966
-Thank you.
-Oh, don't thank me yet.

39:28.066 --> 39:30.836
Trust me, she's a pill.

39:30.936 --> 39:33.539
(engine starts)

39:41.212 --> 39:42.581
(ducks quacking)

39:44.783 --> 39:46.418
Watchers can be pretty
defensive

39:46.518 --> 39:47.919
when it comes
to their assignments.

39:48.019 --> 39:49.555
Just be straight with her.

39:49.655 --> 39:52.724
She's impatient
and has terrific aim.

39:52.824 --> 39:54.426
All right.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.895
If you lie or hide
something,
she'll know.

39:56.995 --> 39:59.898
Then you'll look bad,
and I'll look really bad.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.433
If you aren't the real deal,

40:01.533 --> 40:03.168
she'll probably bite
your eyelids off.

40:04.570 --> 40:05.737
That's nice.

40:06.805 --> 40:10.476
I took this off you.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.811
Thought it was a
weapon.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.113
It beeped a couple times.

40:15.213 --> 40:16.648
Thank you.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.917
GIRL:
You better run.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.421
-This is the Watcher?
-No.

40:23.522 --> 40:26.792
Perhaps you didn't hear
me,
Guinan. I'll say it again.

40:26.892 --> 40:29.528
You have ten seconds to
get
out of here before I lose

40:29.628 --> 40:31.930
my very tenuous grip on
my need

40:32.030 --> 40:34.432
to put my boot
through your face.

40:35.501 --> 40:36.902
She means that.

40:37.002 --> 40:38.637
See you someday.

40:38.737 --> 40:40.438
This one is looking
for a Watcher.

40:40.539 --> 40:42.641
I think you're gonna want
to hear what he has to
say.

40:42.741 --> 40:46.512
Guinan, don't leave
the Earth just yet.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.480
I know you're done
with listening,

40:48.580 --> 40:52.918
but you are not done
with humanity.

40:55.186 --> 40:59.625
Change always comes
later
than we think it should.

41:06.064 --> 41:07.165
GIRL:
Follow me.

41:22.648 --> 41:25.216
How much further?
(panting)

41:25.316 --> 41:27.185
Communicator.

41:27.285 --> 41:31.222
I can read the signal, so
don't
act like you haven't got it.

41:37.295 --> 41:40.666
Without this, I'm
stranded.

41:40.766 --> 41:42.500
I don't care.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.272
Ugh. Keep it.

41:47.372 --> 41:50.041
But pop the energy cell
out
or we're done here.

41:54.079 --> 41:55.246
Good.

42:20.138 --> 42:23.074
Why are you doing this?
What is this pantomime?

42:23.174 --> 42:24.876
In case you're being
followed.

42:24.976 --> 42:26.578
Wh-Where are you
taking me?

42:26.678 --> 42:28.714
To me, of course. The
real me.

42:28.814 --> 42:31.016
This body, like the
others,
is just a temporary host.

42:31.116 --> 42:33.752
Surely, by now, it's
obvious
that I'm not being
followed.

42:35.020 --> 42:36.221
Wait here.

42:47.799 --> 42:49.200
PICARD:
Excuse me.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.269
Are you a friend of
Guinan's?

42:51.369 --> 42:54.039
Absolutely not.

43:02.347 --> 43:03.715
Laris?

43:24.936 --> 43:28.073
Q:
You can't do it.

43:28.173 --> 43:30.776
And you know it.

43:30.876 --> 43:33.111
Oh, sure, you played the
game
for a while.

43:35.113 --> 43:37.749
When nothing was at
stake.

43:37.849 --> 43:41.152
When the only challenge
was fooling everybody

43:41.252 --> 43:44.155
into thinking you had the
nerve.

43:44.255 --> 43:48.126
But now it's real.
The fear is choking you.

43:52.330 --> 43:55.801
Well, here's the truth.

43:55.901 --> 43:58.203
You can't do it.

43:59.971 --> 44:01.907
People are gonna die.

44:02.007 --> 44:05.677
And now your fear, your
doubt,

44:05.777 --> 44:08.847
is the loudest voice
in your head.

44:09.848 --> 44:12.150
(laughs)

44:14.820 --> 44:17.022
That's unexpected.

44:17.122 --> 44:19.357
And most unfortunate.
