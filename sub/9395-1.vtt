00:26.583 --> 00:27.251
Nathan.

00:28.888 --> 00:31.778
- Remember, 20 shots-- no less.
- Got it, dad.

00:32.659 --> 00:34.413
Quit yakking and warm up.

00:51.118 --> 00:53.017
Basket by Nathan Scott!

00:53.098 --> 00:55.043
He really looks sharp out
there tonight.

00:56.328 --> 00:59.325
And now a steal by the Ravens.
They'll go on the offensive.

00:59.667 --> 01:03.758
Coach Whitey Durham urges them on.
Tim Smith -- he's got Scott!

01:03.825 --> 01:06.677
And he hammers it home!

01:06.795 --> 01:10.204
He's already got 14 of the
Ravens' 17 points tonight.

01:11.412 --> 01:13.410
Turn around jumper by
Nathan Scott!

01:13.590 --> 01:17.500
We haven't seen talent like this
since his father, Dan, played for Whitey.

01:17.960 --> 01:21.890
Here's Scott again--
another one! It's all Nathan Scott!

01:23.800 --> 01:26.280
And here he is,
ladies and gentlemen, Lucas Scott.

01:26.896 --> 01:27.756
What's happening, baby?

01:28.852 --> 01:32.588
- 137 and 3 going into tonight's contest.
- He sucks.

01:32.799 --> 01:36.600
And as a special bonus,
we're joined in the booth by Junk Moreti.

01:36.706 --> 01:37.725
You don't have a booth.

01:38.278 --> 01:41.417
Actually, he's 138 and 3
-- Lucas.

01:42.063 --> 01:45.870
Jeez, Edwards, but you can't remember
to run a bar of soap under your pits?

01:46.235 --> 01:48.328
You smell bad, man.
You're ripe.

01:50.160 --> 01:54.346
You guys are stinking up the place!
Time-out!

01:58.005 --> 01:59.985
Come on, hustle,
hustle, hustle!

02:01.481 --> 02:05.956
- Just what in the hell is going on out there?
- Whitey, relax. We're up by 9.

02:06.725 --> 02:07.473
Tim...

02:08.293 --> 02:09.627
Go in for Nathan.

02:13.759 --> 02:17.205
All right, let's get out there and act
like we've played the game before.

02:17.881 --> 02:20.462
Ravens on 3.
1, 2, 3. Ravens!

02:23.007 --> 02:25.598
What have I told you about that?

02:26.206 --> 02:29.293
I don't care if we're up by 5 or 50.

02:29.689 --> 02:32.376
I'm still the coach.
It's still my team.

02:32.832 --> 02:34.194
Whatever you need to believe.

02:38.040 --> 02:41.899
Lucas Scott with the ball.
And he currently nurses a big winning streak.

02:43.306 --> 02:47.539
Come on. 14-13,
game point for team Scott.

02:54.037 --> 02:56.113
And the Hawks pull within one.

02:56.214 --> 02:59.523
And you have to wonder
where is Nathan Scott?

03:03.171 --> 03:04.172
Go on.

03:06.697 --> 03:07.776
Let's go, Nathan!

03:11.468 --> 03:12.932
Don't bother showering tonight.

03:17.003 --> 03:20.039
For those of you at home,
Lucas wears his black shorts tonight

03:20.096 --> 03:21.871
with his traditional white high-tops.

03:21.949 --> 03:24.887
He is currently playing without
a shoe contract, mouth.

03:25.558 --> 03:29.915
Under 20 seconds to go, and it's all tied up.
Fasten your seat belts, folks.

03:29.951 --> 03:34.319
We're going down to the wire.
Stolen by Nathan Scott!

03:34.406 --> 03:41.114
The Ravens have it! They're gonna hold
on 10 seconds remaining on the clock.

03:41.485 --> 03:43.110
Now five!

03:43.520 --> 03:45.910
Luke flashes in the paint.
Fergie finds one on the wing.

03:46.038 --> 03:48.727
- Scott for the game!
- Scott for the game!

04:13.129 --> 04:15.765
You, tell me we didn't
just steal a school bus,

04:15.816 --> 04:18.540
'cause this feels like we
just stole a school bus.

04:18.627 --> 04:20.046
Dude, we just borrowed it,
all right?

04:34.828 --> 04:36.788
So, Nathan,
where's Peyton?

04:37.178 --> 04:37.956
Who knows?

04:38.744 --> 04:39.406
Why?

04:52.671 --> 04:53.864
Look out!

05:38.476 --> 05:42.075
Some of your parents see this
latest incident as tomfoolery,

05:42.822 --> 05:43.897
a little prank.

05:44.762 --> 05:46.825
Personally, I see a little
breaking-and-entering.

05:47.563 --> 05:50.718
Chief Wayman sees possession
and consumption by minors

05:50.840 --> 05:52.760
and a smidgen of
grand theft auto.

05:54.439 --> 05:57.507
That said, I think it's
time we send a message.

05:58.781 --> 06:03.031
The following players were not involved
and will not be reprimanded--

06:04.306 --> 06:07.515
Jake Jagielski,
Ruben Gutierrez,

06:08.084 --> 06:11.883
Tim Smith,
and Nathan Scott.

06:12.928 --> 06:17.925
As for the rest of you, all players involved
are suspended from extracurricular activities,

06:18.001 --> 06:19.747
specifically basketball,

06:20.772 --> 06:22.052
for the rest of the season.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.032
So, you just walk away.

06:32.569 --> 06:35.589
Well, well. Dan Scott.

06:35.972 --> 06:39.050
Half the team suspended, Nathan
triple-teamed the rest of the season,

06:39.127 --> 06:40.417
and you say nothing.

06:40.976 --> 06:43.602
The inmates will not run the asylum.

06:43.965 --> 06:45.522
You're despicable, you know that?

06:46.576 --> 06:48.973
Letting the dreams of this
team just vanish.

06:50.007 --> 06:51.359
You're full of crap.

06:51.912 --> 06:56.925
It comes with old age,
Danny, constipation.

07:03.708 --> 07:05.680
You guys remember Tom Dugan
from grade school?

07:05.946 --> 07:07.773
He used to live next door to
you, right?

07:07.875 --> 07:11.066
Some guy snapped him with a wet towel,
and he lost one of his testicles.

07:12.172 --> 07:14.087
- Come on.
- Okay, junk.

07:14.322 --> 07:17.414
- Just saying what I heard.
- Anyway, man, what you reading these days?

07:17.604 --> 07:20.312
Steinbeck--
"the winter of our discontent."

07:20.788 --> 07:21.700
Let me hear some.

07:22.100 --> 07:24.286
- Nah.
- Come on, dog.

07:24.357 --> 07:26.794
You know I be reading vicariously
through you.

07:28.766 --> 07:29.990
Peyton Sawyer.

07:35.233 --> 07:36.549
You seen her webcam?

07:38.100 --> 07:39.108
In her bedroom --

07:39.893 --> 07:41.735
I hear she's naked on it, like,
all the time.

07:44.439 --> 07:46.250
What? I hear things.

07:48.299 --> 07:49.665
You know, I saw her the other night.

07:51.311 --> 07:53.112
She almost ran me over, of course.

07:53.792 --> 07:56.261
- Yeah, she pretty fine, huh?
- Ah, she's all right.

07:59.774 --> 08:01.227
Just shoot for teams, all right?

08:09.280 --> 08:10.090
Hey, mom.

08:10.458 --> 08:11.268
Hey, hon.

08:14.699 --> 08:15.758
It smells good in here.

08:16.427 --> 08:17.979
Did you change your hair?

08:18.748 --> 08:22.092
If by "change" you mean
"dragged a brush through it," then yeah.

08:22.859 --> 08:24.652
- Well, it looks nice.
- Thank you.

08:27.361 --> 08:29.956
The  magazine pages are sticky again.
Little pervs.

08:30.141 --> 08:33.134
- Oh, hey, Luke. You been reading this?
- I don't know, Haley.

08:33.251 --> 08:36.217
Is that the "why do I hang out with these people?"
issue, because you're on the cover of that, right?

08:36.299 --> 08:40.601
No, actually, it's the "my best friend is an idiot"
issue, and there you are.

08:42.741 --> 08:45.696
- Haley, would you like to join us?
- Hell, yes.

08:47.923 --> 08:50.478
- So, honey, how was your day?
- Good, thanks.

08:50.882 --> 08:53.580
" Good" is relative, considering a
third of the world is starving,

08:53.841 --> 08:57.317
which does not change the fact that I am
clumsy as hell. Did I tell you that I fell down today?

08:57.430 --> 09:00.835
Yeah, slipped off the curb,
face down, butt in the air.

09:02.018 --> 09:03.948
Too graphic? Sorry.
I'll just be quiet.

09:05.750 --> 09:08.280
- So, I got something for you, Lucas.
- Actually, I found it.

09:08.576 --> 09:12.822
Sorry. Not that I was looking for something
specifically, which implies some hideous sort

09:12.863 --> 09:14.453
of "Joey loves Dawson " scenario
and completely creep me out,

09:14.527 --> 09:15.853
but, you know, we saw it, and...

09:19.410 --> 09:20.430
Give him the book.

09:23.179 --> 09:25.759
Wow. "Julius Caesar."

09:26.073 --> 09:29.768
"There's a tide in the affairs of men"
-- or something like that.

09:30.389 --> 09:31.126
Nice.

09:32.845 --> 09:34.668
Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much.

09:35.150 --> 09:36.968
Whatever. That's what you're into.

09:53.085 --> 09:55.860
Well, well, Keith Scott.
What do you know?

09:56.348 --> 09:57.377
How you doing, Whitey?

09:57.616 --> 09:58.825
Take a load off.

09:59.116 --> 10:02.081
You... you got a second?

10:02.404 --> 10:05.594
Oh, I got a lot of seconds.
Or haven't you heard?

10:05.700 --> 10:07.273
Oh, yeah, I heard.

10:11.000 --> 10:11.993
Just a little.

10:13.919 --> 10:15.337
A little more.

10:17.863 --> 10:19.259
That's good. That's good.

10:24.082 --> 10:27.196
I saw your little
brother today-- Danny.

10:27.507 --> 10:29.105
He called me "despicable."

10:29.914 --> 10:32.791
Said I crush the dreams
of young men.

10:33.237 --> 10:36.165
Was he talking about himself
or Nathan, do you think?

10:36.493 --> 10:37.813
Both, I suppose.

10:40.722 --> 10:44.096
Hey, what did you average
when you played for me?

10:44.198 --> 10:47.527
Oh, about 5,006 beers a night.

10:49.421 --> 10:52.197
Well, at least you
were consistent.

10:52.345 --> 10:55.479
Yeah, you gotta give me that.
Hey, you know...

10:57.014 --> 11:00.189
- Lucas plays.
- Lucas? Oh.

11:01.433 --> 11:05.754
- Oh, Dan’s other son.
- Well, Karen’s son.

11:06.809 --> 11:08.969
Dan's on the birth certificate,
but they never got married.

11:09.676 --> 11:11.006
Where does he play?

11:11.432 --> 11:14.370
Uh...This park down by the river.

11:14.581 --> 11:16.221
Oh, come on, Keith.

11:16.770 --> 11:20.570
If the kid had any promise,
he'd be in the gym with the real players.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.050
Like Nathan, you mean?

11:24.680 --> 11:25.640
Come on, coach.

11:26.357 --> 11:27.868
Just take a little drive with me.

11:32.654 --> 11:35.825
Luke is on fire tonight.
How do you say "hot" in French?

11:35.911 --> 11:38.113
- Flambé.
- Luke is flambé.

11:38.660 --> 11:41.180
Fergie finds Luke,
who takes out junk again.

11:41.287 --> 11:42.675
They never learn, mouth.

11:43.381 --> 11:45.076
See, that's what I’m
talking about.

11:45.286 --> 11:47.868
All right, lets say I'm interrested,
and I'm not saying I am.

11:49.115 --> 11:51.348
Why put him through that?

11:51.701 --> 11:53.724
Because he should know
that he's good--

11:53.944 --> 11:56.526
not just playground good,
but good, period.

11:57.943 --> 11:59.443
He could use that in his life.

11:59.710 --> 12:01.979
We could all use that in our lives.

12:03.288 --> 12:05.859
Yeah. But we had our chance.

12:09.155 --> 12:12.586
- So, you and Karen-- are you...
- Friends.

12:14.754 --> 12:19.611
You know, I'm the kid's uncle,
and I'm in their lives. It is what it is.

12:20.958 --> 12:23.007
I remember when Dan told me
Karen was pregnant

12:23.108 --> 12:25.527
right after their senior year
in high school.

12:26.868 --> 12:31.019
I told him he should honor his
scholarship and go to college.

12:31.812 --> 12:34.002
I'll tell you one thing--
you did Karen a favor.

12:34.470 --> 12:35.652
And Lucas, too.

12:38.678 --> 12:40.378
Now maybe you can do me one.

12:55.344 --> 12:56.665
What are you wasting your time at now?

12:57.960 --> 13:00.238
- I didn't hear you come in.
- Oh, imagine that.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.843
You know nobody listens
to this crap.

13:08.897 --> 13:10.411
So, I waited for you tonight.

13:11.232 --> 13:12.897
Yeah, the guys wanted to tip a few.

13:13.111 --> 13:14.892
And you didn't even think
to let me know?

13:15.158 --> 13:17.489
That's why I came by.
You want to come?

13:18.568 --> 13:20.575
- With the guys?
- And me.

13:20.953 --> 13:21.932
And the guys.

13:23.812 --> 13:26.223
You know what, Peyton?
I'm getting really tired of this.

13:26.315 --> 13:29.925
- I came here to spend time with you.
- Yeah, me and half the team.

13:30.006 --> 13:32.174
Whatever. You want to be a bitch?
That's cool!

13:32.276 --> 13:35.174
Just listen to your loser rock,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

13:35.244 --> 13:39.531
- How about you don't see me tomorrow?
- Fine by me. Like I don't have other options.

13:47.231 --> 13:51.015
Look, I'm sorry.
Peyton, I'm really sorry.

13:52.730 --> 13:57.482
It's just a lot of these guys got suspended,
so it's like this stupid bonding thing.

13:58.821 --> 14:01.341
Look, I wish it was just you and me.

14:02.232 --> 14:05.023
But I was hoping you'd
come anyway--

14:05.744 --> 14:08.110
make it a lot more
bearable, okay?

14:27.438 --> 14:30.223
- Scott.
- What's up, coach?

14:30.316 --> 14:32.026
Not you. You.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.629
You read a book or something.

14:50.514 --> 14:51.589
Nice, isn't it?

14:53.376 --> 15:00.386
A lot of people like their gyms loud.
I like mine like this-- quiet, clean...

15:01.548 --> 15:03.157
Kind of like a church.

15:04.782 --> 15:06.826
A lot of praying done here, anyway.

15:10.897 --> 15:12.934
You played ball in grade school.

15:13.867 --> 15:14.855
Why'd you quit?

15:15.966 --> 15:16.831
I didn't.

15:17.205 --> 15:19.401
What, four guys in the park?

15:20.261 --> 15:22.243
That's not exactly basketball.

15:22.586 --> 15:24.204
Then what do you think
we're doing out there?

15:24.388 --> 15:26.667
I don't know.
Planning a bank job?

15:28.909 --> 15:32.601
Look, I've got an opening
in my lineup, varsity.

15:33.554 --> 15:35.007
Chance for a lifetime.

15:39.170 --> 15:40.285
What do you say?

15:41.975 --> 15:44.371
I say those people that pray
here are wasting their time.

15:47.183 --> 15:49.016
God doesn't watch sports.

16:04.802 --> 16:06.005
Were you gonna tell us, man?

16:06.618 --> 16:07.397
It's nothing.

16:09.347 --> 16:11.559
Whitey asked you to play on the team,
and it's nothing?

16:12.465 --> 16:13.965
It's nothing 'cause I’m not playing--

16:15.292 --> 16:16.296
not with those guys.

16:18.010 --> 16:21.405
Luke, man, I’ve been guarding you almost
every night since we was 12 years old, right?

16:21.466 --> 16:22.752
And I won how many games?

16:23.196 --> 16:25.117
It just seems like a
waste to me, man.

16:25.639 --> 16:29.218
Well, it doesn't to me. Don't you guys
ever think that maybe we belong here?

16:29.791 --> 16:34.425
No. We belong here.
You've never belonged here.

16:35.342 --> 16:38.384
Thanks a lot, skills.
Just shoot for teams.

16:40.979 --> 16:44.163
Yo, luke, man, you know you're
one of my best friends, right?

16:44.645 --> 16:47.906
Ain't nothing never gonna change
that, man. But keep it real.

16:48.429 --> 16:52.187
We ain't shooting for teams.
We're shooting to be your excuse.

16:53.258 --> 16:54.951
And I ain't about to be
a part of that, man.

17:19.710 --> 17:21.069
Somebody left it at the door.

17:22.349 --> 17:23.373
Take it off.

17:44.345 --> 17:46.526
- Mom, you okay?
- Yeah.

17:51.258 --> 17:52.557
Do you know who left it?

17:53.422 --> 17:54.953
Coach Durham, probably.

18:00.048 --> 18:01.686
He asked me to play.

18:03.826 --> 18:04.973
Maybe you should.

18:06.392 --> 18:07.881
You sound like Skills.

18:09.300 --> 18:13.027
Those guys refused to play today. They said
they didn't want to be my excuse.

18:13.130 --> 18:14.322
How'd you feel about that?

18:14.952 --> 18:18.998
Honestly? I was pissed. Those guys
are supposed to be my friends.

18:19.073 --> 18:20.349
They are your friends.

18:22.356 --> 18:23.549
Do you remember that?

18:27.804 --> 18:29.448
My first leather basketball.

18:30.261 --> 18:32.990
That was the year that skills' father
told us there was no Santa Claus.

18:33.058 --> 18:35.141
Yeah, and I tried to
talk you out of it.

18:36.487 --> 18:38.418
Then you said something
I’ll never forget.

18:39.211 --> 18:42.520
You said you felt bad for the kids who never
figured it out, because when they grew up

18:42.566 --> 18:45.617
and had kids of their own, there wouldn't be
any gifts on Christmas morning.

18:47.788 --> 18:49.108
You're a good kid, Luke.

18:49.775 --> 18:52.447
But sometimes I feel like you're sitting out
your life on account of me,

18:52.478 --> 18:53.896
and I don't want that for you.

18:55.499 --> 18:58.438
My past is not your future, okay?

19:05.964 --> 19:08.037
- What are you slinging?
- About 160.

19:08.125 --> 19:08.954
Give me that.

19:09.927 --> 19:13.167
Your mom called. She won't be back until next week.

19:13.424 --> 19:15.835
- What do you know about Whitey inviting...
- Your son to play?

19:15.909 --> 19:18.461
- Don't call him that.
- He's got our last name, dad.

19:18.549 --> 19:24.044
The fact that he shares your last name
is only wishful thinking on his mother's part.

19:24.216 --> 19:27.386
We were young-- summer after high school.
We made a mistake.

19:27.494 --> 19:30.316
You made a mistake, all right.
I mean, this guy's a zombie.

19:30.797 --> 19:32.086
Okay.

19:33.412 --> 19:37.315
Look, it's kind of screwed up, all right?
People talk about it.

19:42.479 --> 19:43.498
Get out of there.

19:45.696 --> 19:48.768
I want you to go to this kid,
encourage him not to play.

19:49.413 --> 19:51.695
- I'm not afraid of him, dad.
- Well, you should be.

19:52.448 --> 19:54.606
We've worked too hard to have
anyone coming in now,

19:54.666 --> 19:56.452
disrupting the offense,
taking away shots.

19:57.313 --> 20:01.317
Anyway, this has more to do with
Whitey and me than you.

20:02.075 --> 20:04.507
- Why do you say that?
- It's a long story.

20:05.060 --> 20:06.483
If you want, I'll tell you someday.

20:07.481 --> 20:10.287
But for now, I want you to go
to this kid and talk to him

20:10.506 --> 20:13.124
and trust me when I tell you, Nathan,
there's a bigger picture here--

20:13.318 --> 20:16.232
your picture,
and this kid's not in it.

20:32.954 --> 20:35.181
So, your pops finally mentioned the
bastard spawn, huh?

20:36.179 --> 20:38.375
They say he's got game.
Maybe we could use him.

20:40.302 --> 20:43.670
Please. I can get us to the state championship
with three blind guys and a cripple,

20:43.926 --> 20:45.943
which is practically what I got with
you and what's left.

20:46.415 --> 20:48.529
Nice. So, where are we going?

20:49.687 --> 20:50.593
Let's go to the park.

21:04.877 --> 21:05.692
Nice shot.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.695
Think you can hit that against a
double team, down by 2,

21:10.156 --> 21:11.825
packed house telling you you suck?

21:12.711 --> 21:14.703
How about just two people
telling you you suck?

21:16.074 --> 21:17.094
What do you want?

21:17.666 --> 21:18.454
What do I want?

21:19.504 --> 21:20.836
What do you want, man?

21:21.759 --> 21:25.455
I mean, other than my girlfriend and
my spot in the lineup, huh?

21:29.443 --> 21:32.223
None of us want you on the team, man.
I don't want you.

21:32.546 --> 21:36.734
The guys don't want you. My girlfriend sure
as hell doesn’t want you.

21:39.243 --> 21:43.171
But here's the deal.
You and me, one on one.

21:44.415 --> 21:45.970
You can name the
time and place.

21:46.713 --> 21:49.826
If you win,
I'll quit the team.

21:50.800 --> 21:54.822
If I win, you crawl back in your little hole
and you remember your place in all this.

22:03.686 --> 22:07.004
Time and place, baby.
Time and place.

22:16.769 --> 22:20.184
So, Nathan challenged you.
Are you gonna play him?

22:20.781 --> 22:23.536
I don't know. It's not like I have
anything to prove.

22:24.019 --> 22:28.247
Yeah, I guess. But don't you just
want to show him sometimes-- oh, damn!

22:28.980 --> 22:32.783
What's up?! I was attacked by a
flock of crows last week!

22:33.383 --> 22:34.975
I'm totally serious!

22:36.097 --> 22:39.219
- By the way, it's a murder.
- What?

22:39.317 --> 22:40.985
More than one crow is a murder

22:41.579 --> 22:43.581
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

22:43.679 --> 22:47.401
A parliament of owls,
an exultation of larks, a murder of crows.

22:48.081 --> 22:51.385
I think that is why people think
you're weird, right there.

22:53.387 --> 22:57.738
Ah. I would like to show him sometimes,
though, what a mistake he's made.

22:58.409 --> 22:59.213
Dan?

23:00.233 --> 23:04.677
Mostly for mom...
And... sometimes for me.

23:06.848 --> 23:10.293
So, Luke, what are Ravens--
I mean, more than one?

23:11.737 --> 23:13.053
An unkindness.

23:35.284 --> 23:36.483
Why wouldn't you play?

23:37.055 --> 23:38.428
I do play-- every night.

23:40.589 --> 23:42.043
It's not the same, Luke.

23:42.691 --> 23:45.743
Why? What makes it less of a
game if people don't see it?

23:45.899 --> 23:46.768
I'll tell you why.

23:48.651 --> 23:53.741
When I was a kid, my father took me
to Raleigh to see David Thompson play.

23:54.234 --> 23:56.855
I was 9 years old. I couldn't have
cared less about basketball.

23:57.116 --> 24:02.092
But when Thompson stepped on
the court, he was so young,

24:02.823 --> 24:07.054
so quick, and just so graceful
that I was mesmerized.

24:07.734 --> 24:10.673
I couldn't take my eyes off him
until late in the game,

24:10.883 --> 24:14.749
and I look up at my dad,
and he's got tears in his eyes.

24:16.558 --> 24:20.662
14,000 strangers and
my father's crying

24:21.139 --> 24:22.957
because he's so beautiful.

24:24.211 --> 24:27.636
He played with such poetry that he
made us feel like we were a part of it.

24:28.806 --> 24:30.125
You have a gift, Luke,

24:30.943 --> 24:33.714
and it's a crime not to let people
see it, to hide it in the park.

24:38.490 --> 24:40.641
It's a damn shame.
That's why.

24:44.466 --> 24:45.813
Keith's body shop and towing.

24:55.168 --> 24:56.738
That's me inside your head.

24:57.629 --> 24:58.265
What?

24:59.713 --> 25:00.671
NOFX.

25:01.899 --> 25:03.696
That's me inside your head.

25:04.808 --> 25:06.610
- It's the lyrics from...
- I know the song.

25:18.569 --> 25:22.519
Nathan... It's me.
Listen, my car broke down.

25:23.069 --> 25:24.392
You're gonna have to come
pick me up.

25:25.447 --> 25:26.870
So leave the gym.

25:27.679 --> 25:29.579
Listen, it'll take you,
like, 10 minutes.

25:30.187 --> 25:31.984
I'm on River Road around the curve.

25:33.213 --> 25:36.309
Well, sucks to be you.

25:43.710 --> 25:47.146
Listen, are you sure you got a ride?
I mean, I can wait if you want.

25:47.412 --> 25:49.097
Yeah, that's what I want.

25:52.476 --> 25:54.349
Listen, have your dad call me
with an estimate.

25:55.425 --> 25:58.123
- My uncle?
- If that's your story.

26:04.011 --> 26:05.357
Can I ask you a question?

26:06.336 --> 26:07.403
It's a free country.

26:08.118 --> 26:09.480
Why are you a cheerleader?

26:10.432 --> 26:13.422
No offense or anything, but you're about
the least cheery person I know.

26:26.130 --> 26:27.005
Keith!

26:28.809 --> 26:32.837
- Hey, how you been, big brother?
- Not bad. How about you?

26:32.996 --> 26:37.322
Good, good. Dealership's good.
I sent you some business not long ago.

26:37.681 --> 26:41.666
Oh, yeah, I... I meant to call you
and thank you for that.

26:42.105 --> 26:46.667
- Yeah. Well, we're all busy, right?
- Right.

26:51.756 --> 26:53.533
Come on. Let me give you a ride.

26:56.343 --> 26:58.018
I'll let you insult me.

27:03.337 --> 27:05.350
First of all, you don't know me.

27:06.476 --> 27:09.379
Second of all, you don't know me.

27:12.169 --> 27:14.468
God, why are guys such jerks?!

27:16.127 --> 27:17.376
Guys or Nathan?

27:18.585 --> 27:19.373
Him.

27:20.546 --> 27:21.186
You.

27:22.907 --> 27:23.525
I don't know.

27:24.820 --> 27:26.079
We share the same father.

27:26.925 --> 27:28.057
Yeah, I heard that.

27:30.018 --> 27:31.252
He's kind of an ass.

27:33.509 --> 27:35.414
So that must suck,
having to see him around.

27:35.951 --> 27:36.785
For my mom.

27:38.087 --> 27:39.214
I never knew him.

27:39.607 --> 27:42.224
- But she told you he was your dad?
- Yeah, eventually.

27:43.750 --> 27:46.120
We used to play in junior leagues
together-- me and Nathan.

27:46.357 --> 27:50.683
- Basketball?
- Yeah, and I loved it,
and I was good at it.

27:51.379 --> 27:54.844
You ever have something that you knew that you
were better at than almost anybody else?

27:56.678 --> 27:57.594
Sex.

27:59.909 --> 28:00.748
Joke.

28:03.918 --> 28:04.916
Anyways...

28:06.739 --> 28:10.666
Guys kept teasing me about it,
about how Nathan’s dad was my dad, too.

28:11.776 --> 28:12.902
So I asked my mom,

28:14.270 --> 28:15.539
and she said he wasn't.

28:16.375 --> 28:21.361
But I get home,
and I hear her crying in her room.

28:22.391 --> 28:23.507
I knew it was true.

28:24.557 --> 28:25.750
So I never went back.

28:26.875 --> 28:30.173
I told my mom it was because
I didn't want to have to see his face.

28:31.131 --> 28:35.345
But... it was mostly because...

28:37.520 --> 28:39.102
I didn't want her to have to.

28:46.016 --> 28:48.154
So, why'd you just
tell me all that?

28:48.436 --> 28:49.987
I mean, we don't even
know each other.

28:52.614 --> 28:53.894
Maybe that's the point.

29:00.008 --> 29:03.048
Nathan's got a shot here,
Keith-- a real future.

29:03.781 --> 29:06.680
A real future.
Let me ask you something.

29:07.708 --> 29:10.842
Do you ever even think about Lucas' future?
Do you ever think about that?

29:11.287 --> 29:14.399
I can't change the fact this kid
exists. If I could, I would.

29:14.717 --> 29:17.928
The truth is, I told Karen I’d
take care of it. But she--

30:12.964 --> 30:16.009
Tomorrow night, at midnight,
at the riverfront.

30:19.276 --> 30:20.960
But if I win, I'm gonna
want something else.

30:31.489 --> 30:35.383
I love that car. I love that car.
My wife's got that car.

30:40.090 --> 30:41.655
I'm guessing you're
not car shopping.

30:42.675 --> 30:45.439
He's a boy who wants to play
basketball, reluctantly.

30:45.941 --> 30:48.708
I find it horrifying and amusing,
then after all this years,

30:48.801 --> 30:51.308
it takes something as simple as that
to bring you around.

30:52.623 --> 30:53.856
I'm only thinking of the kid.

30:53.929 --> 30:57.912
You have no right to think of him,
not today or any other day of his life. How dare you?

30:58.189 --> 31:00.774
- Are you finished?
- I haven't even started.

31:00.882 --> 31:04.261
We've asked nothing of you, and you
have delivered in fine fashion.

31:04.379 --> 31:08.260
I'll expect that to continue.
If Lucas decides to play, you'll do nothing.

31:08.347 --> 31:10.972
Anything else might make me angry
and detract from the pleasant,

31:11.054 --> 31:12.719
cordial side you see now.

31:13.533 --> 31:16.974
You know, I know your son doesn't
exactly fit in, but Nathan is all-state,

31:17.297 --> 31:19.847
and I'm not sure why you'd want to
humiliate your kid like that.

31:20.630 --> 31:24.065
You're right, Dan.
I'd rather not humiliate him.

31:24.362 --> 31:26.077
You've done that enough.

31:33.968 --> 31:34.740
Nathan.

31:36.548 --> 31:37.397
What's up, dad?

31:41.054 --> 31:43.105
If I wanted a daughter,
I'd adopt one.

31:43.220 --> 31:44.715
So you could abandon her, too?

31:47.484 --> 31:48.851
Just a joke, dad.

31:49.184 --> 31:52.235
Yeah. And this bet tonight--
is that a joke, too?

31:52.810 --> 31:56.945
Or would you really quit the team?
You have everything to lose here and nothing to gain.

31:57.524 --> 32:00.166
Sometimes what you call "everything",
I call "nothing."

32:00.290 --> 32:02.302
I just think it's best if you
don't do this, Nathan.

32:02.916 --> 32:04.218
We'll find another way.

32:05.175 --> 32:06.080
No.

32:07.150 --> 32:10.473
Dad, I do a lot of stuff for you--

32:11.355 --> 32:12.583
almost everything.

32:14.421 --> 32:15.926
But I'm gonna do this for me.

32:17.806 --> 32:18.828
Hi, Mr. Scott.

32:25.470 --> 32:27.773
So, I would have preferred a
warning shot on this one--

32:27.846 --> 32:30.012
something to let me know what
was coming with Lucas.

32:30.098 --> 32:34.087
Yeah, that's fair enough.
But you should see him play, Karen.

32:34.144 --> 32:37.748
I mean, it's like-- it's like poetry,
you know?

32:38.230 --> 32:40.845
- And he's gonna be fine.
-Yeah, I know.

32:41.762 --> 32:45.611
Do you ever wonder about it,
Keith-- how we got to this?

32:46.549 --> 32:51.044
Hanging out in the old cafe, lamenting the past,
Haley listening in from behind?

32:51.156 --> 32:52.708
I am not listening.

32:54.147 --> 32:57.168
- Okay, I was. I am.
- Right.

32:59.463 --> 33:01.413
I just wondered how we got here so fast.

33:01.556 --> 33:05.949
I don't know. When I see Lucas in high school,
it all seems like a blink of an eye.

33:06.471 --> 33:09.498
But otherwise, it seems like
it's been forever.

33:17.337 --> 33:19.189
- Wow.
- Yeah.

33:19.450 --> 33:22.958
This place looks great.

33:23.062 --> 33:25.241
Thanks. I just finished putting
up the lights.

33:25.794 --> 33:27.376
Miniature golf is never
going to be the same.

33:29.276 --> 33:30.274
Your mom is worried.

33:30.571 --> 33:32.799
She's downstairs with Keith
picking through her past.

33:33.644 --> 33:35.292
Do you think I’m being
selfish playing Nathan?

33:35.676 --> 33:36.342
Do you?

33:37.785 --> 33:38.743
A little bit.

33:39.635 --> 33:43.975
I mean, if I walked away, then my mom
wouldn't be downstairs worried about it now.

33:44.631 --> 33:50.668
You know, I don't say things like this
very often 'cause it sounds weird, but...

33:51.707 --> 33:55.987
you're a really good guy,
and I'm glad we're friends.

33:57.181 --> 33:59.090
But you and your mom
worry too damn much.

34:17.563 --> 34:21.690
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to an historic night of basketball.

34:21.762 --> 34:24.962
I'm Mouth McFadden, along with my
gamey partner, Jimmy Edwards,

34:25.002 --> 34:26.933
and, Jimmy, we're in for
a treat tonight.

34:27.010 --> 34:29.590
And who doesn't love a treat,
Mouth? I know I do--

34:29.683 --> 34:32.129
s'mores, ice cream, cake.

34:33.062 --> 34:36.045
So, if you're not doing it for your dad,
then why are you doing it?

34:36.594 --> 34:38.975
- You wouldn't get it.
- I guess not.

34:39.770 --> 34:42.549
So what if this guy plays?
Are you really that threatened?

34:42.743 --> 34:45.472
- I'm not threatened by anyone.
- Well, then, why do it?

34:46.911 --> 34:48.108
To prove I'm the best.

34:49.235 --> 34:51.708
Okay, so, what if he wins?
What does he get?

34:53.172 --> 34:54.263
He gets you.

35:04.032 --> 35:07.683
Just moments before the stroke of 12:00,
and still no Nathan Scott.

35:07.780 --> 35:09.521
The natives are getting
restless, Mouth,

35:09.575 --> 35:12.147
judging by the crowd that
envelops our booth.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.182
You don't have a booth.

35:13.371 --> 35:16.551
Junk Moreti joins us now.
Junk, you care to make a prediction?

35:16.648 --> 35:19.402
I predict you guys will be the two
biggest morons out here.

35:20.391 --> 35:24.139
And it looks like Nathan Scott has arrived,
driven by car right onto the court.

35:36.995 --> 35:39.663
By the way, I hope you don't mind,
but I told a few people.

35:54.199 --> 35:56.160
Come on, let's go, babe!
Let's go, Nathan!

36:04.638 --> 36:08.761
Okay, folks, here we go-- 15 by ones.
Make it, take it, win by one,

36:08.827 --> 36:11.324
and you can feel the
intensity in the air.

36:12.031 --> 36:13.978
- You ready for this?
- Why not?

36:14.956 --> 36:19.374
- It's your life.
- Yeah. It is.

36:26.076 --> 36:30.597
Oh-ho! A 25-footer rips the silk like
Jimmy Edwards in a size 3 dress.

36:31.914 --> 36:33.501
Go ahead, man.
I'll give you that all night.

36:43.842 --> 36:45.138
What happened to all night?

36:49.548 --> 36:52.619
Is that all you got, man?
If that's all you got, this is over.

36:56.943 --> 36:58.014
Yeah! All right!

36:58.599 --> 37:00.059
This looks to be a battle, mouth.

37:52.374 --> 37:54.856
No foul. Basket counts.

37:56.812 --> 37:59.773
Besides... you won't score again.

38:00.582 --> 38:04.662
Oh, the basket counts, and it's
14-12, game point for Nathan.

38:04.785 --> 38:06.572
He could win it all
right here.

38:08.738 --> 38:09.891
Nathan for the win.

38:11.912 --> 38:14.534
Holy crap! Did you see that?!

38:14.876 --> 38:17.791
Someday men will write stories
about that block.

38:17.970 --> 38:21.973
Children will be named after it.
Argentinean women will weep for it.

38:24.881 --> 38:26.990
Luke gets a basket,
and he's down by one.

38:29.223 --> 38:32.116
You're down by one, man.
Don't choke now.

38:36.100 --> 38:39.320
- Another dagger, and it's all tied up!
- I think I'm gonna puke.

38:39.495 --> 38:41.645
Come on, Nate! Come on, shut him down, Nathan!

38:42.152 --> 38:45.300
This is it, folks-- no going back now.
The next basket wins it.

38:46.564 --> 38:49.944
He's never mentioned you, man--
not once in all these years.

38:51.413 --> 38:52.516
This is for my mom.

38:59.392 --> 39:00.747
Luke for the win!

39:07.616 --> 39:11.147
It's good! Lucas Scott takes it 15-14,

39:11.218 --> 39:14.587
and there is bedlam and delirium
and felicity for all!

39:42.656 --> 39:43.792
So, what did you bet?

39:44.427 --> 39:47.504
- I win Nathan stays on the team.
- Why?

39:48.088 --> 39:53.495
Because it's the last thing he wants.
And anyway, it's not about him.

39:55.594 --> 39:56.376
Peyton.

40:03.730 --> 40:04.923
I'll be seeing you.

40:16.382 --> 40:18.804
There is a tide in the
affairs of men...

40:20.984 --> 40:22.429
Which, taken at the flood,

40:23.887 --> 40:25.192
leads on to fortune...

40:26.008 --> 40:27.037
Don't worry, dad.

40:27.645 --> 40:29.140
Your dreams are still safe.

40:29.979 --> 40:34.993
But omitted, and the voyage of their life
is bound in shallows and miseries...

40:44.065 --> 40:46.237
On such a full sea are
we now afloat...

41:02.708 --> 41:05.125
And we must take the current
when it serves...

41:27.258 --> 41:29.838
Or lose the ventures before us.
