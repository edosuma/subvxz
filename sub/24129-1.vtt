America was eager to import
cheap Mexican vegetables

02:57.246 --> 02:59.524
and export American
staple crops.

02:59.558 --> 03:01.836
And Mexico was deep in debt,

03:01.871 --> 03:04.632
so the U.S. government offered
to bail them out.

03:04.667 --> 03:08.222
But they demanded
some big compromises.

03:08.257 --> 03:09.879
Okay, Mexico,
if we're gonna trade,

Since the Mexican government
wasn't investing as much

03:26.378 --> 03:28.863

the cartels were able

03:28.898 --> 03:31.107

An underwire is
a completely different thing.

have such a stranglehold

very few options to opt out.

year-round.

05:07.203 --> 05:10.310
Most importantly,
not buying Mexican avocados

05:10.344 --> 05:12.933
only further victimizes
these communities.

05:12.967 --> 05:17.006
Some towns' entire economies are
dependent on American imports.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.802
And the avocado trade
is only one small way

05:19.836 --> 05:22.183
in which these cartels benefit
from Americans.

05:22.218 --> 05:25.048
Weak gun laws in the U.S.
allow them to purchase

05:25.083 --> 05:28.362
military-grade American weapons that they then use

05:28.397 --> 05:29.605
to intimidate communities

05:29.639 --> 05:31.503
and overpower
local police forcers.

05:31.538 --> 05:33.367
Byzantine immigration policies

05:33.402 --> 05:35.852
allow cartels to charge
very steep fees

05:35.887 --> 05:38.199
for smuggling people
across the border,

05:38.234 --> 05:41.375
even if those migrants have a legitimate reason to be here.

05:41.410 --> 05:44.033
And it's important to remember
that it's still the case

05:44.067 --> 05:46.829
that cartels make
the vast majority
of their profits

05:46.863 --> 05:50.004
from selling illegal drugs
to American consumers.

05:50.039 --> 05:51.834
So, Murph, the real problem

05:51.868 --> 05:54.181
isn't that Americans
are eating too many avocados.

05:54.215 --> 05:58.461
It's that we need to fix

07:00.454 --> 07:03.146
But the only reason bacon became
a pop culture meme factory

07:03.181 --> 07:06.564
is that the pork industry waged
a massive marketing campaign

of rom-com.

07:44.498 --> 07:47.121
But the Pork Board couldn't
figure out how to sell

07:47.156 --> 07:51.091
the largest part of the pig,
the fat-filled pork belly,

07:51.125 --> 07:53.162

is saying that,

19:51.120 --> 19:53.640
if we as a society
decided to subsidize

19:53.675 --> 19:57.023
healthier fruits and veggies
and had more transparency

19:57.057 --> 19:59.301
about what goes in
our processed food and meats,

19:59.336 --> 20:01.096
we'd have healthier
food options,

20:01.130 --> 20:03.029
and our environment
would be healthier too.

20:03.063 --> 20:06.343
Ahh.Uh... yeah, exactly.

20:06.377 --> 20:08.828
And the most important thing
isn't what you buy.

20:08.862 --> 20:10.657
It's who you vote for.

20:10.692 --> 20:12.487
Most food production
is regulated

20:12.521 --> 20:15.248
by a piece of legislation
called the Farm Bill,

20:15.283 --> 20:17.664
which gets reauthorized
twice a decade,

20:17.699 --> 20:21.703
and the U.S. Dietary Guidelines
are rewritten every five years.

20:21.737 --> 20:24.706
So be aware of these issues
and support elected officials

20:24.740 --> 20:27.709
who will have your interests
at heart when the time comes.

20:27.743 --> 20:30.712
And in the meantime,
sometimes, occasionally,

20:30.746 --> 20:33.922
within moderation,
we can... have nachos?

20:33.956 --> 20:36.925
Yeah, with a little
less bacon, though.

20:36.959 --> 20:38.237
[bell dings]Oh! Yeah.

20:41.067 --> 20:43.725
Here.
I made another batch.

20:43.759 --> 20:45.382
Hey.

20:45.416 --> 20:46.728
Thanks, bro.

20:49.489 --> 20:53.735
♪♪

20:53.769 --> 20:55.875
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm.

20:55.909 --> 20:57.601
These are better than mine,
aren't they?

20:57.635 --> 20:59.119
No. No.
What? No.

20:59.154 --> 21:01.190
Adam's nachos suck.

21:04.642 --> 21:07.162
Hey, Rodrigo.
So I'm backstage
on our set.

21:07.196 --> 21:10.476
Thank you so much
for chatting with us
from your secure location.

21:10.510 --> 21:12.305
This is not really
a secure location.

21:12.340 --> 21:14.411
This is actually my office,
um, in New Haven

21:14.445 --> 21:15.964
at the Yale School
of Management.

21:15.998 --> 21:17.552
But thank you, Adam,
for the invitation.

21:17.586 --> 21:19.899
[laughing]
Okay, well, thanks for--

21:19.933 --> 21:21.935
thanks for ruining
the illusion of our show.

21:21.970 --> 21:23.178
I really appreciate it.

21:23.212 --> 21:27.182
Why would the cartels get
into avocados to begin with?

21:27.216 --> 21:29.288
I mean, of all the things,
why avocados?

21:29.322 --> 21:31.462
Why not some other
illegal trade?

21:31.497 --> 21:33.809
Well, I mean, one of the things
we have to understand

21:33.844 --> 21:36.605
is that they already are
in other illegal trades.

21:36.640 --> 21:39.470
If there are other things going
around that are also valuable,

21:39.505 --> 21:41.265
then it's kind of like,
"Why not?"

21:41.300 --> 21:42.853
Like, I'm already here.
I've already spent

21:42.887 --> 21:46.305
a lot of energy and resources
trying to control this territory

21:46.339 --> 21:49.929
and there's a very valuable
market for avocados

21:49.963 --> 21:52.345
that I can get a piece of,
then I will as well.

21:52.380 --> 21:56.038
But another reason is that it
can be a very helpful way

21:56.073 --> 21:59.628
to diversify, um,
how they launder money.

21:59.663 --> 22:03.460
So, in the U.S.,
most of what we know
about drug cartels

22:03.494 --> 22:07.429
comes from, you know,
prestige hour-long drama
television shows.

22:07.464 --> 22:09.707
What is the biggest
misconception

22:09.742 --> 22:13.332
that you think people get
from that sort of television
about this problem?

22:13.366 --> 22:14.988
When you frame
the drug problem

22:15.023 --> 22:18.958
as this rogue, you know, kingpin
who's running a business

22:18.992 --> 22:21.132
and who's just this,
you know, crazy criminal--

22:21.167 --> 22:22.996
Right, the guy I've seen on TV
doing meth

22:23.031 --> 22:24.135
and screaming at everybody

22:24.170 --> 22:25.378
and, like, stabbing people
with knives.

22:25.413 --> 22:26.828
That guy.
Right.

22:26.862 --> 22:28.726
Then if that's how
you conceptualize

22:28.761 --> 22:31.142
why we have a drug--
a drug trade problem,

22:31.177 --> 22:34.180
then the solution is, go,
please go catch that guy.

22:34.214 --> 22:37.183
But when we understand that this
is a systematic problem,

22:37.217 --> 22:39.358
a structural problem
where we have demand,

22:39.392 --> 22:41.394
and therefore
there's gonna be supply,

22:41.429 --> 22:43.638
it doesn't matter how many
of these people you eradicate.

22:43.672 --> 22:45.709
There's always gonna be somebody
else who's gonna come up.

22:45.743 --> 22:49.057
And so the more we fight these
organizations only through force

22:49.091 --> 22:51.853
and we retain the structural
characteristics of the market,

22:51.887 --> 22:54.373
the more we create
an evolutionary dynamic

22:54.407 --> 22:56.236
where the organizations
have to become

22:56.271 --> 22:59.205
increasingly sophisticated,
increasingly well-organized,

22:59.239 --> 23:01.725
increasingly well-armed,
increasingly aggressive.

23:01.759 --> 23:03.036
So, the more we fight
with force,

23:03.071 --> 23:05.176
until we address
the structural problems,

23:05.211 --> 23:06.661
it just makes
the problem worse.

23:06.695 --> 23:08.179
Exactly.

23:08.214 --> 23:09.422
Does that mean
we need to, you know,

23:09.457 --> 23:11.355
create a legal market
for these drugs?

23:11.390 --> 23:12.667
Is that what you advocate?

23:12.701 --> 23:14.703
There are only two ways
in which you can resolve

23:14.738 --> 23:17.188
the incoherence between
the regulation and behavior.

23:17.223 --> 23:19.052
You either go
the Singapore route,

23:19.087 --> 23:21.192
where they have
aligned enforcement

23:21.227 --> 23:22.711
at all levels of the market,

23:22.746 --> 23:26.853
and they have extremely strict
enforcement on consumption...

23:26.888 --> 23:30.236
or you go the Portugal route,
which has kind of decided

23:30.270 --> 23:32.721
to regulate every aspect
of the drug market,

23:32.756 --> 23:35.137
which is what we did
with alcohol, for example,

23:35.172 --> 23:37.588
when we saw the impacts
of prohibition.

23:37.623 --> 23:39.694
A third thing
that we can do is

23:39.728 --> 23:41.903
make Americans
much more aware

23:41.937 --> 23:46.079
of the actual impact
of their behavioral decisions.

23:46.114 --> 23:49.462
Every time you choose
to consume an illegal drug,

23:49.497 --> 23:51.878
given our current policy,

23:51.913 --> 23:55.606
you are directly contributing
to somebody's death.

23:55.641 --> 23:58.782
There's no kind
of indirect link there.

23:58.816 --> 24:01.094
That's a really strong
statement.You are personally contributing.

24:01.129 --> 24:02.406
It's-- I--
And I have no--

24:02.441 --> 24:04.063
I have no reservations
in making it.

24:04.097 --> 24:06.168
People have to be aware that,

24:06.203 --> 24:10.138
when you kind of decide
to consume cocaine,

24:10.172 --> 24:14.107
you are directly contributing
to somebody's death in Mexico...

24:14.142 --> 24:15.488
[Adam]
Wow....um, in a town somewhere,

24:15.523 --> 24:17.801
or somewhere else
in Latin America.

24:17.835 --> 24:20.631
If I were--
If I did cocaine,
which I do not,

24:20.666 --> 24:22.771
I would think about that
very hard before I did it

24:22.806 --> 24:24.186
the next time,
I'll tell you that.

24:24.221 --> 24:25.740
Well, thank you so much
for coming on

24:25.774 --> 24:27.086
to talk to us
about this, Rodrigo.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.950
Really appreciate it.No, this is my pleasure.

24:28.984 --> 24:30.572
I really appreciate
your interest in this,

24:30.607 --> 24:32.540
and hopefully this helps change
some people's minds.
