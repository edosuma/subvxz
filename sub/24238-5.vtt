00:13.211 --> 00:16.291
CHAS: <i>This is it. 1247 Enstrom.</i>

00:18.920 --> 00:20.590
You one for anagrams, Chas?

00:20.626 --> 00:22.296
No. Why?

00:24.180 --> 00:25.600
Enstrom...

00:25.930 --> 00:27.970
Move the letters around,
and what have you got?

00:29.052 --> 00:30.211
Monster.

00:30.544 --> 00:32.674
(LAUGHS) It's funny, eh?

00:32.858 --> 00:35.148
Yeah. I'm in hysterics.

00:40.382 --> 00:43.217
(SNORTS) Yes.

00:43.253 --> 00:44.604
Clearly the right place.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.350
I think we're expected.

00:47.290 --> 00:48.761
Enter freely

00:48.797 --> 00:50.967
and of your own free will.

00:51.560 --> 00:54.730
(CHUCKLES) I've always
wanted to say that.

01:15.170 --> 01:16.795
(GROWLING)

01:16.928 --> 01:19.206
Master Beroul will be down presently.

01:19.242 --> 01:21.662
Please wait right here. (SNORTING)

01:29.120 --> 01:31.244
Bullocks! Oye!

01:31.369 --> 01:32.912
He said to wait here.

01:32.948 --> 01:35.538
Yeah. And that's just what
I want you to do.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.716
BEROUL: I rather like the smell.

01:58.606 --> 02:00.877
Master Beroul, I presume.

02:00.913 --> 02:03.304
Beroul will suffice.

02:03.340 --> 02:05.985
Oh, the pool's not ready yet.

02:06.381 --> 02:09.794
I've got to wait for
the bodies to liquefy,

02:09.830 --> 02:12.175
dredge out the bones...

02:12.210 --> 02:13.309
And then?

02:13.345 --> 02:16.553
(CHUCKLES) Use it for
my daily swim, of course.

02:16.647 --> 02:18.712
Oh... Lovely.

02:18.748 --> 02:20.795
(CHUCKLING) Isn't it, though?
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

02:21.084 --> 02:24.134
A man needs to stay in shape.

02:24.552 --> 02:27.002
Ah, you're no bloody man.

02:28.030 --> 02:33.440
Something you'd do well
to remember, Mr. Constantine.

02:34.314 --> 02:35.589
You know me.

02:35.662 --> 02:38.625
Your reputation precedes you.

02:40.145 --> 02:45.345
Why else would I go to all this
trouble to bring you here?

02:45.460 --> 02:48.215
Ah, you used Trish as a lure.

02:48.539 --> 02:53.999
(CHUCKLES) Mr. Chandler is one of the few
people on this Earth you care about.

02:54.594 --> 02:58.964
I knew you wouldn't refuse your
old friend's plea for help.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.030
You could've just texted me.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.530
And would you have come? (CHUCKLES)

03:04.210 --> 03:06.345
A man of your nature, John,

03:06.380 --> 03:10.371
requires something more theatrical.

03:10.620 --> 03:13.183
More dangerous.

03:15.550 --> 03:17.055
What's this all about?

03:17.091 --> 03:19.466
I'll explain everything.

03:19.564 --> 03:23.404
I had what you Brits
would call a brainwave.

03:23.924 --> 03:27.174
A branch office of Hell, right here.

03:27.424 --> 03:30.924
A franchise operation, like fast food,

03:30.960 --> 03:35.005
but with the added benefit
of eternal damnation.

03:35.254 --> 03:40.597
So many souls just begging to be
corrupted and consumed. (LAUGHS)

03:41.210 --> 03:44.670
So much power for a demon to absorb.

03:44.984 --> 03:49.984
The sky is the limit for the
entrepreneur who gets in first.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.330
(GROANING)

03:53.982 --> 03:56.646
But I have got competition.

03:56.920 --> 04:00.759
Five other demons
with similar aspirations,

04:00.920 --> 04:04.775
and I want that competition eliminated.

04:04.981 --> 04:06.406
And that's where I come in.

04:06.528 --> 04:07.988
Precisely.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.920
I don't do anything till I see the girl.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.920
Which one?

04:15.700 --> 04:17.240
Chas' Trish.

04:17.769 --> 04:19.180
Ah! (CHUCKLES)

04:20.079 --> 04:22.585
Nothing my kind savors more

04:22.620 --> 04:28.057
than the sweet, subtle flavors
of an innocent soul.

04:28.233 --> 04:29.794
Where is she?

04:30.111 --> 04:31.416
Safe.

04:31.464 --> 04:32.964
Right here.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.580
(LAUGHING)

04:34.616 --> 04:37.958
You could say she's a prisoner of love,

04:38.427 --> 04:40.257
held, quite literally,

04:40.906 --> 04:43.446
within my heart.

04:44.356 --> 04:47.160
Let her go, you bastard. Let her go!

04:47.196 --> 04:50.132
No, Chas, if what Beroul
is saying is true,

04:50.168 --> 04:53.238
then any attack on him
is an attack on your daughter.

04:53.274 --> 04:55.681
But we don't know if it's true, do we?

04:58.080 --> 05:00.424
- Chas?
- Not to worry.

05:00.580 --> 05:02.088
He isn't dead. (CHUCKLES)

05:03.080 --> 05:05.680
<i>Just displaced.</i>

05:08.690 --> 05:10.360
CHAS: <i>Bloody hell!</i>

05:12.220 --> 05:13.720
(GROANS)

05:14.220 --> 05:16.985
Not that the idiot could've hurt me.

05:17.068 --> 05:20.408
Now, will you take the job?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.637
If I'm working for you,

05:23.673 --> 05:26.885
I want a fat salary, and a swanky hotel.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.135
Done.

05:28.404 --> 05:29.774
Now, get out.

05:30.060 --> 05:32.682
It's time for
<i>The Young and the Restless,</i>

05:32.782 --> 05:34.322
and I never miss it.
