Oh, yeah,
I gots that good hot cocoa,

00:33.033 --> 00:34.991
and all 'em gifts
for my friends.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.647
- Ain't nothing gonna ruin
my holiday cheer, yo.

00:39.996 --> 00:41.780
It's Santa Claus!

00:44.348 --> 00:48.700
Get back here,
you garbage kid!

00:54.358 --> 00:55.577
Phew! That was close.

01:06.501 --> 01:09.112
Season's greetings.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.418
Oh, mans!

01:10.461 --> 01:11.375
I'm so tired
of dealing with you

01:11.419 --> 01:12.855
year after year.

01:12.898 --> 01:15.075
Think of it as a...

01:15.118 --> 01:17.338
- A holiday tradition.

01:17.381 --> 01:18.948
Wells, you can
keep your tradition.

01:18.991 --> 01:19.992
Now, let me go!

01:20.036 --> 01:21.603
I'm afraid I can't do that.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.692
I need your help
getting me back in

01:23.735 --> 01:25.955
with the Holiday Mob.

01:25.998 --> 01:27.478
You mean
that criminal organization

01:27.522 --> 01:29.045
that's run by Baby New Year?

01:29.089 --> 01:30.829
That's the one.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.309
Well, I'm sures
they'd love to have you

01:32.353 --> 01:34.224
'cause yous even
shadier than they is!

01:34.268 --> 01:36.096
But that's the problem.

01:36.139 --> 01:38.054
They haven't trusted me

01:38.098 --> 01:43.320
since the time we celebrated
New Year's down in Ky-U-Ba.

01:45.801 --> 01:47.977
Happy New Year!

01:48.020 --> 01:50.153
I'm delighted,
to be celebrating with you,

01:50.197 --> 01:51.589
my most trusted friend.

01:51.633 --> 01:54.462
You're like
a brother to me, Santa.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.159
Likewise.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.856
Boss!

01:57.900 --> 02:01.686
We caught this reindeer
snooping outside with this.

02:06.082 --> 02:10.347
Ooh! We think he was
about to make a move on you.

02:12.784 --> 02:15.178
Is that true?
Are you moving in on me?

02:15.222 --> 02:16.962
Oh, no, no, no.

02:17.006 --> 02:18.486
Of course not.

02:18.529 --> 02:21.141
That could be anybody's
reindeer and bazooka

02:21.184 --> 02:23.795
with my name engraved on it.

02:25.319 --> 02:26.189
It's not mine.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.932
Muah!

02:29.975 --> 02:33.240
I know it was you, Santa.

02:33.283 --> 02:35.851
You broke my heart.

02:35.894 --> 02:39.637
- Take him away, boys.
- No!

02:39.681 --> 02:41.422
Ever since that day,

02:41.465 --> 02:45.034
I've missed
my brothers in the mob.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.515
That's so sad, bro.

02:47.558 --> 02:49.908
Is there anything I can do
to help you get back in?

02:49.952 --> 02:52.302
Put this on.

02:52.346 --> 02:54.130
Why do I gots to
dress like an elf?

02:54.174 --> 02:57.089
Because the
Holiday Mob loves elves.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.569
And if I'm
going to get back in,

02:58.613 --> 03:01.311
I need
a trusted source to, uh...

03:01.355 --> 03:02.834
vouch for me.

03:10.755 --> 03:12.061
You know the plan.

03:12.104 --> 03:15.978
Now get in there
and don't em-bar-rass me.

03:16.021 --> 03:19.547
And remember,
Santa is watching you.

03:26.467 --> 03:27.642
Who do we have here?

03:27.685 --> 03:29.470
The name's Donnie Mistletoe.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.950
I'm the elf who unionizes
all of Santa's Workshops.

03:31.994 --> 03:33.822
It's an honor to meet you.

03:33.865 --> 03:36.259
You have done a great service
to our elf brothers up north.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.304
They're my top earners.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.175
I owe you a ton of gratitude.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.524
Glad to hear that

03:40.568 --> 03:42.265
'cause I needs to
ask for a favor.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.006
And what is this favor?

03:44.049 --> 03:46.530
I want you to let Santa
back into the organization.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.708
Forget it.
This, I cannot do.

03:50.752 --> 03:52.406
But Santa really
misses you guys

03:52.449 --> 03:53.624
and wants to make amends.

03:53.668 --> 03:55.147
Plus, ain't your holiday

03:55.191 --> 03:58.238
all about fresh starts
and new beginnings?

03:58.281 --> 03:59.674
You make
a good case, Donnie.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.329
But how do I know
I can trust him?

04:02.372 --> 04:04.026
Do you vouch for him?

04:04.069 --> 04:06.420
Sure, I'll vouch for him.

04:06.463 --> 04:09.292
Then make it official
by kissing the ring.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.859
But that thing is nasty, yo.

04:10.902 --> 04:11.729
Do it.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.168
[smooches, gags] There.

04:16.212 --> 04:17.779
Good. Good.

04:17.822 --> 04:20.216
Now, where's that
jolly cub of a Santa?

04:20.260 --> 04:21.522
He's up on the roof.

04:21.565 --> 04:22.827
Come on down, Santa.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.269
- Ho-ho-ho!
- Ow!

04:29.312 --> 04:31.836
- Merry-- Ow! Ow, ow!
- Save it.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.056
If you even think about
making a move on me again,

04:34.099 --> 04:36.232
I'll make sure
both you and your little helper

04:36.276 --> 04:38.147
never celebrate
another New Year.

04:38.190 --> 04:39.714
<i>-Capische?
- Yes.</i>

04:39.757 --> 04:40.889
Understood.

04:40.932 --> 04:42.194
Ow!

04:42.238 --> 04:43.326
So that's it, right?

04:43.370 --> 04:45.110
- Santa's back in?
- Not quite.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.635
First, you two bozos
are gonna go to work for me.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.637
So Santa here
can prove his loyalty.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.031
Of course, we'll do anything.

04:53.075 --> 04:54.642
That's good.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.774
I need you to visit some
business associates of mine

04:56.818 --> 05:00.038
that need
a little persuading.

05:06.915 --> 05:10.179
Hey there, Georgie boy.

05:10.222 --> 05:11.572
Santa Claus?

05:11.615 --> 05:13.400
Hop in.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.141
No, no, no, no, no.

05:16.185 --> 05:19.754
Sit in the front seat
with me.

05:20.972 --> 05:22.409
He said the front seat!

05:24.628 --> 05:28.153
So tell me,
how are things?

05:28.197 --> 05:29.720
They're good, I guess.

05:29.764 --> 05:30.765
Why so nervous?

05:30.808 --> 05:31.983
We's only going for a ride.

05:32.027 --> 05:34.812
You know,
I heard a nasty rumor

05:34.856 --> 05:37.119
that you never
paid the Boss his cut

05:37.162 --> 05:38.642
from President's Day.

05:38.686 --> 05:40.601
So let me ask you,
where'd you put the money?

05:40.644 --> 05:43.560
Why, I-I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:43.604 --> 05:46.346
Then allow me
to be a little more clearer.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.304
- Ow!
- Where's the money, George?

05:48.348 --> 05:49.610
Where's the money, huh?

05:49.653 --> 05:50.872
Where's the money?

05:50.915 --> 05:52.395
What money?

05:52.439 --> 05:54.832
Nobody spends any money
on President's Day.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.443
Oh, yeah?

05:56.486 --> 05:59.141
Then whats about all 'em
good President's Day sales?

06:04.364 --> 06:05.626
Give those back!

06:05.669 --> 06:07.541
You're not
going to find anything!

06:07.584 --> 06:10.935
Oh, really?
Then what's this?

06:10.979 --> 06:13.285
Looks like the Boss' money
if you ask me.

06:13.329 --> 06:15.026
Fine, take it!

06:15.070 --> 06:17.768
A pleasure
doing business with you.

06:17.812 --> 06:20.075
Merry Christmas!

06:23.513 --> 06:25.036
<i>♪ Oh, Danny boy</i>

06:25.080 --> 06:27.778
<i>♪ The pipes
The pipes are calling ♪</i>

06:30.781 --> 06:31.782
What's this?

06:36.396 --> 06:39.050
Move that rubbish
outta me way!

06:39.094 --> 06:41.183
Good tidings to you.

06:41.226 --> 06:42.576
What's the meaning of this?

06:46.928 --> 06:48.320
Mm-mmm-mmm!

06:48.364 --> 06:50.845
That's some good
milkshakes you gots there.

06:50.888 --> 06:52.977
Hey! No skimming off the top.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.718
We're not skimming off the top.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.328
We're taking the whole thing.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.159
Oh, shamrocks.

07:08.036 --> 07:10.691
Listen, my furry friend,
the Boss wants to make this

07:10.734 --> 07:15.565
the most successful
nightclub in all of Mi-am-mi.

07:15.609 --> 07:17.393
- Got it?
- But in order to do that,

07:17.437 --> 07:18.786
he's going to need you

07:18.829 --> 07:20.309
to call an early spring
on Groundhogs Day

07:20.352 --> 07:22.311
so we can pack this place
full of spring breakers.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.532
But-But I'm not
gonna pretend

07:25.575 --> 07:27.098
that I'm not
afraid of my shadow

07:27.142 --> 07:29.187
just so you can
make money off of some club.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.885
Oh, really?

07:30.928 --> 07:33.017
It sounds like our friend here
needs some convincing.

07:33.061 --> 07:35.890
So, you're afraid
of shadows, are you?

07:35.933 --> 07:38.153
Well, let's see
how you like this?

07:42.549 --> 07:43.637
I can do a bunny!

07:43.680 --> 07:44.942
No bunny, no bunny.

07:44.986 --> 07:46.422
- A birdie.
No, no, no.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.902
- You like that?
- I'm not gonna look.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.730
- Please don't!
- A cute, little puppy.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.427
No, no, no.
Not a puppy.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.863
Okay!

07:52.907 --> 07:55.257
Okay. I'll call
an early spring.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.477
Just stop with the shadows!

07:59.174 --> 08:00.654
See? That wasn't so hard.

08:00.697 --> 08:03.352
Merry Christmas,
you filthy animal.

08:03.395 --> 08:04.571
- Oh!

08:05.876 --> 08:08.444
Well done, boys

08:08.488 --> 08:11.708
We've just got word
from the Boss.

08:11.752 --> 08:14.537
He's impressed
with your work...

08:14.581 --> 08:18.454
...and has decided
to make Santa a made man.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.413
- He wants me back in!
Whoo-hoo!

08:22.589 --> 08:25.548
Oh, yeah. We did it, yo!

08:29.639 --> 08:31.293
Give me your hands.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.822
Now repeat after me.

08:38.866 --> 08:41.521
May I roast
like chestnuts on an open fire

08:41.564 --> 08:43.914
if I ever
betray my friends again.

08:43.958 --> 08:46.961
"May I roast
like chestnuts on an open fire

08:47.004 --> 08:50.660
if I ever betray
my friends again."

08:54.055 --> 08:55.447
Congratulations.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.798
You're officially, back in.

08:57.841 --> 09:02.324
- Thank you. Thank you.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.545
And in honor
of this special occasion,

09:05.588 --> 09:09.244
I've got a surprise
waiting for you outside.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.465
A brand new tricycle?

09:13.509 --> 09:17.295
This is what I've always
wanted for Christmas, Santa.

09:22.866 --> 09:28.785
Get down!

09:30.221 --> 09:31.309
It's an ambush!

09:53.984 --> 09:55.333
Ho-ho-ho!

10:00.600 --> 10:03.385
Now surrender.
This operation belongs to me.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.517
I can't believe we trusted you.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.128
And this is how you repay me?

10:07.171 --> 10:08.738
Oh, don't be such a crybaby.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.088
Now that
I'm in charge of this family,

10:11.132 --> 10:12.873
nothing can stop me

10:12.916 --> 10:17.094
from taking over
all of the holidays!

10:17.138 --> 10:18.748
Not so fast, Santa.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.185
You ain't the only one
giving out surprises today.

10:24.362 --> 10:25.363
The Feds!

10:28.671 --> 10:30.455
Hey, I'm Baby New Year!

10:30.499 --> 10:32.022
- Let us go.

10:32.066 --> 10:34.155
Thanks to
my undercover operation,

10:34.198 --> 10:35.983
the government
now has enough evidence

10:36.026 --> 10:39.160
to put you all behind
bars for a long, long time.

10:39.203 --> 10:40.944
You dirty rat.

10:40.988 --> 10:43.381
When I get my hands on you...

10:43.425 --> 10:45.166
Yeah, yeah.
Tell it to the judge.

10:45.209 --> 10:47.516
Enjoy your Holiday, Beast Boy.

10:47.559 --> 10:51.912
Because next year,
Santa Claus is coming to town.
