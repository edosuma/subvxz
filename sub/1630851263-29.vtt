What are you doing
in my chest, dude?

00:41.215 --> 00:42.303
Teaching you a lesson,

00:42.999 --> 00:43.956
on the art

00:44.740 --> 00:46.263
of concealment.

00:50.224 --> 00:52.574
- Ta-da!
- Wow! Cool.

00:52.617 --> 00:54.532
I know. Batman taught it to me.

00:54.576 --> 00:56.882
And today, I teach it to you.

00:56.926 --> 00:58.971
- No, thanks.
- No, thank you.

00:59.015 --> 01:00.538
We don't want to learn
another one of your
boring lessons, Robin.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.627
And besides, we already
made plans for today.

01:02.671 --> 01:06.066
Yeah, we's going to sit here
all day and do nothing y'all.

01:06.109 --> 01:07.893
Well, too bad!

01:07.937 --> 01:10.461
Today you are going
to learn the art
of concealment.

01:10.505 --> 01:13.377
And before you say no again,
you should know
that this lesson

01:13.421 --> 01:15.988
involves us
playing hide and seek.

01:16.032 --> 01:18.556
- All right!
- I love playing hide and seek.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.210
What is the hide and seek?

01:20.254 --> 01:21.907
You know the game where
everyone hides

01:21.951 --> 01:23.735
and one person
has to find them.

01:23.779 --> 01:27.957
Oh, on my home planet
of Tamaran
we have such a game,

01:28.000 --> 01:32.440
But we call it Hunt 'N
Glunkakakakakah!

01:32.483 --> 01:34.094
That's great, Star.

01:34.137 --> 01:35.921
I'll be it first.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.749
That way I can see
how much training you'll need.

01:37.793 --> 01:43.146
Now, go hide.
One, two, three, four...

01:43.190 --> 01:44.800
You'll never find us in here.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.323
Ready or not, here I come!

01:48.064 --> 01:49.935
- Found you.
- Aw!

01:49.979 --> 01:52.416
That was a terrible
hiding spot, Titans.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.810
You clearly need
a lot of training.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.812
Okay, Beast Boy. You're it.

01:58.683 --> 02:00.294
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:00.337 --> 02:02.861
You fools ain't going to be
able to hide from me, yo.

02:02.905 --> 02:09.433
One, two, three, uh...d,e,f...

02:09.477 --> 02:10.956
Where do we hide?
Where do we hide?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.655
Relax. First,
let's do a little recon.

02:17.659 --> 02:20.183
<i>Ready or not, here I come!</i>

02:20.227 --> 02:22.185
He turned himself
into the blood hound?

02:22.229 --> 02:23.969
How are we going to hide
from that?

02:24.013 --> 02:27.277
By following lesson one
in the art of concealment...

02:27.321 --> 02:28.496
covering your scent.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.063
Now, quick, hop in.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.630
You want us to hide
in the trash compactor?

02:32.674 --> 02:34.154
Yes. Now, get in.

02:44.076 --> 02:46.644
Oh, man, it smells
like Robin's fish breath.

02:46.688 --> 02:48.298
Pretty great, right?

02:48.342 --> 02:49.517
Beast Boy will never be able
to pick up our scent.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.171
But it reeks in here.

02:51.214 --> 02:54.565
And I am trying very hard
not to do the throwing up.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.567
Look on the bright side.

02:56.611 --> 02:59.091
You've just completed
your first lesson
in the art of concealment

03:03.052 --> 03:05.185
Is this also
part of your lesson?

03:05.228 --> 03:06.403
No.

03:06.447 --> 03:07.883
We must have
activated the compactor.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.580
Quick, see if you can brace it.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.239
It is not working.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.327
Nice going, Robin.

03:17.371 --> 03:18.720
Now we're gonna get flattened.

03:18.763 --> 03:20.069
This is all your fault.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.244
We need to call for help.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.376
Birdarang, come in.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.204
<i>Birdarang, do you read me?</i>

03:24.247 --> 03:26.075
What's up, homeslice?

03:26.118 --> 03:28.382
<i>Listen to me. We've trapped
ourselves inside the compactor,</i>

03:28.425 --> 03:30.862
<i>so I need you to shut it down.</i>

03:30.906 --> 03:35.345
What's that? I'm in the middle
of a ridonkulous dance party.
Oooh, oooh!

03:35.389 --> 03:38.261
I said I need you
to shut it down!

03:38.305 --> 03:40.655
<i>Word. I'm on it,</i> el jefe.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.575
What!
What are you doing, Birdarang?

03:47.618 --> 03:50.621
I'm shutting this party down.

03:50.665 --> 03:54.277
We're going on all night
until the sun come up,
homeslice.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.323
<i>Oh, no!
We're about to get flattened!</i>

04:02.285 --> 04:03.417
Found you!

04:04.940 --> 04:06.811
Okay, Star.
This time, you're it.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.946
You sure you got the
hangs of it, momma?

04:10.989 --> 04:15.298
Indeed. I will simply
play this game
like we do on my home planet.

04:15.342 --> 04:20.303
One Tamaran, two Tamaran,
three Tamaran...

04:20.347 --> 04:23.393
Ready or not, let the Hunt...

04:23.437 --> 04:26.266
And the Glunkakakakakah begin!

04:29.486 --> 04:32.097
To those who are being
the hunted,

04:32.141 --> 04:37.407
prepare to feel
the Glunkakakakakah!

04:37.451 --> 04:41.498
I don't know what
"Glunkakakakakah" means,
but it doesn't sound good.

04:41.542 --> 04:44.327
I think they dice people up
into itty bitty pieces
on her planet.

04:44.371 --> 04:47.287
Man, these crazy Tamarans, man.
They're crazy.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.811
Yeah, way less seeky
and way more slashy.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.769
Maybe we should
call off the game.

04:51.813 --> 04:54.642
Relax. No one's in danger
because Star
will never find us.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.818
And how do you expect us
to stay so hidden?

04:56.861 --> 04:59.864
By following lesson two
in the art of concealment,

04:59.908 --> 05:01.997
becoming a master of disguise!

05:07.481 --> 05:10.310
You cannot hide
forever, friends!

05:10.353 --> 05:14.009
You shall soon
feel the Glunkakakakakah!

05:14.052 --> 05:15.793
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

05:15.837 --> 05:18.187
Batman taught me.
So yes, it'll work.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.406
I hope you're right.

05:23.497 --> 05:26.282
- I thinks I gotta poop.
- Hold it in, Beast Boy.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.200
You!

05:31.243 --> 05:34.203
Tell me
where the friends are hiding?

05:37.859 --> 05:42.342
Forfeit the location
or face the annihilation.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.824
Give them up now

05:46.868 --> 05:48.173
of face the cert--

05:48.217 --> 05:50.175
No, wait, it's me, Robin!

05:50.219 --> 05:53.353
I give up! Just don't give me
the Glunkakakakakah!

05:53.396 --> 05:55.267
Oh, it is the you,
friend Robin.

05:55.311 --> 05:58.836
Very well.
If you do not wish to have
the Glunkakakakakah,

05:58.880 --> 06:01.273
then no Glunkakakakakah,
you shall have.

06:01.317 --> 06:03.711
Ah. Phew.

06:03.754 --> 06:06.844
Yo, what is Glunkakakakakah
mean anyway?

06:06.888 --> 06:11.109
I believe it is what you
Earthlings refer to
as the kiss.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.720
- Ah!
- Ooh, ooh.

06:12.763 --> 06:14.025
I would like to play
the Glunkakakakakah, please.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.244
Me too, me too.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.683
Wow!

06:19.727 --> 06:24.427
Booyah! That was the sweetest,
softest Glunkakakakakah
that I've ever received.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.211
Wait. I changed my mind.

06:26.255 --> 06:29.563
I want the Glunkakakakakah!
Give me the Glunkakakakakah!

06:29.606 --> 06:32.870
I am sorry, friend Robin,
but once the Glunkakakakakah

06:32.914 --> 06:35.264
has been rejected,
the rules of the game state

06:35.307 --> 06:38.876
that I cannot offer you
another one ever, ever again.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.270
Nooooo!

06:42.619 --> 06:43.751
Cut it out you big baby.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.709
Right. Sorry.

06:45.753 --> 06:49.452
Okay, Cyborg, you're it.

06:49.496 --> 06:53.413
No problem. With all my tech,
it'll be easy to find you guys.

06:53.456 --> 06:54.892
One, two, three...

06:54.936 --> 06:57.112
Quick, Titans, hide!

06:57.155 --> 06:58.635
[speaking gibberish]...20.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.594
Ready or not, here I come.

07:00.637 --> 07:02.639
Where to hide? Where to hide?

07:02.683 --> 07:05.076
Cyborg's robot body can track
our heat signatures.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.470
So hiding from him
is not gonna be easy, yo.

07:07.514 --> 07:11.300
Which is why we should follow
lesson three in the art
of concealment.

07:11.343 --> 07:12.780
Hide inside Silkie!

07:12.823 --> 07:13.650
What?

07:17.611 --> 07:20.135
Ew! It's all warm
and sticky in here.

07:20.178 --> 07:22.093
Which is precisely the point.

07:22.137 --> 07:24.487
Hiding inside
Silkie's warm body
should mask our heat.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.967
I hope you're right, fool.

07:30.145 --> 07:32.452
<i>Multiple heat
signatures detected.</i>

07:32.495 --> 07:35.106
You thought you could
hide from me?

07:35.150 --> 07:37.805
Booyah! Mega spicy chips!

07:39.154 --> 07:41.373
Hide and snack, baby.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.592
See, it's working.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.507
Cyborg will never
find us in here.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.423
But I think
something else did.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.209
Ah! What is that, yo?

07:51.253 --> 07:53.124
It sounds like the monster!

07:53.168 --> 07:54.822
And it is headed this way!

07:55.736 --> 07:58.608
How's you guys?

07:58.652 --> 07:59.783
Yo-ho-ho!

07:59.827 --> 08:01.611
It's just our old pal, Freak.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.395
Yo, what you
doing up in here, Freak?

08:03.439 --> 08:05.528
Silkie eat Freak.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.225
Wow! Bummer, man.

08:08.705 --> 08:11.142
Oh, vegetables!

08:11.186 --> 08:13.362
Oh, you smell my okra.

08:14.755 --> 08:17.671
Vegetable! Vegetable!

08:17.714 --> 08:18.976
Don't give it to a him,
Beast Boy.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.238
He's just gonna want more.

08:20.282 --> 08:22.632
Sorry Freak, Bossman says no.

08:22.676 --> 08:26.288
Oh. Freak do booty scooty?

08:29.291 --> 08:32.424
<i>Booty!</i>

08:32.468 --> 08:36.733
<i>♪ Scoot you booty
Now do the booty scooty ♪</i>

08:41.608 --> 08:44.045
<i>♪ Scoot you booty
Now do the booty scooty ♪</i>

08:44.088 --> 08:47.265
<i>Booty!</i>

08:47.309 --> 08:50.225
Aww! I got to give him one now.

08:50.268 --> 08:51.400
Fine.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.538
Freak, love you!

08:58.581 --> 09:00.104
I love you too, Freak.

09:00.148 --> 09:03.281
Now give Freak more!

09:03.325 --> 09:05.457
Sorry, Freak! I was fresh out.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.899
- Ahh!
- Run!

09:23.737 --> 09:25.173
I think I see a way out.

09:29.656 --> 09:30.961
Found you!

09:31.005 --> 09:32.572
Okay, Raven is it.

09:34.443 --> 09:36.619
No, I've had enough hide
and seek for one day.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.795
Come on, Raven. One last round.

09:38.839 --> 09:41.058
I promise we'll hide in a spot
that's so good

09:41.102 --> 09:43.234
you'll never find us
in 100 years.

09:43.278 --> 09:46.586
Whatever.
One, two, three, four...

09:55.116 --> 09:58.249
Oh, boy.
It's time for my story.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.774
Now, where
did I put that remote?

10:03.167 --> 10:06.214
Oh, so that's where
they were hiding
all these years.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.303
Whatever.
