12:18.302 --> 12:19.782
Bye.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.194
[dramatic music]

12:46.635 --> 12:48.463

12:48.550 --> 12:49.507
[engine revving]

12:55.426 --> 12:56.514
[intense music]

12:56.601 --> 12:58.125
Clark!

12:59.387 --> 13:01.781
[tires screeching]

13:04.000 --> 13:05.915
[car honking]

13:06.002 --> 13:08.613
[tires screeching]

13:08.700 --> 13:11.355
Mom, are you alright?

13:11.442 --> 13:13.923
Clark!

13:23.063 --> 13:24.238
[Jonathan]
'Police found the truck.'

13:24.325 --> 13:25.761
Abandoned out by
the Stewart farm.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.546
- Anybody else see the driver?
- No.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.548
I could have sworn
it was you, Clark.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.115
I guess I'm not the only
one with a vision problem.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.464
Look, I don't understand.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.249
Whoever it was,
how did they get your keys?

13:35.336 --> 13:37.512
I have no idea.
I only went into the antique..

13:39.122 --> 13:41.081
- What is it, mom?
- Nothing.

13:41.168 --> 13:44.388
It's just that Rose Greer
was acting very strange.

13:44.475 --> 13:47.217
I found $5000 in cash
under a dresser.

13:47.304 --> 13:51.004
It had a Smallville
Savings and Loan band on it.

13:51.091 --> 13:52.483
She said a customer paid her,
but--

13:52.570 --> 13:54.137
You think
it's from the bank robbery?

13:54.224 --> 13:56.096
- It crossed my mind.
- So wait a minute.

13:56.183 --> 13:57.924
Rose took your keys,
turned into Clark

13:58.011 --> 13:59.577
and then tried
to run you down?

13:59.664 --> 14:01.797
You're right, it-it's crazy.

14:01.884 --> 14:05.366
- I don't think so.
- What?

14:05.453 --> 14:07.585
I saw a flash of
Tina Greer's skeleton.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.892
I-it was weird and green.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.807
It didn't look human.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.635
You know, like the ones
you see in anatomy books?

14:13.722 --> 14:16.203
That's probably because Tina was
born with a soft bone disease.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.555
They had that poor girl on
all these experimental drugs.

14:20.642 --> 14:23.166
'Doctors didn't believe
she'd live to see first grade.'

14:23.253 --> 14:25.386
She did get better,
right around her third birthday.

14:27.127 --> 14:28.998
It's right after the meteor
shower, wasn't it?

14:29.085 --> 14:30.608
Yeah.

14:32.175 --> 14:34.656
Clark, what do you
think Tina is doing?

14:34.743 --> 14:36.745
I don't know.

14:36.832 --> 14:39.400
I saw the same weird skeleton
flash just after the robbery..

14:39.487 --> 14:42.011
..I think.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.795
I just wish
I could control this.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.973
What if you try focusing it?
You know, like a telescope?

14:47.060 --> 14:51.412
Yeah. You could start
with something small.

14:54.328 --> 14:57.244
Try to tell me what
I have in my hand right now.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.204
It's your pocketknife.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.817
You could see through my hand.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.950
No, you always carry your
knife in that pocket.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.737
[chuckles]

15:12.824 --> 15:14.478
[chuckles]

15:14.565 --> 15:16.916
[instrumental music]

15:34.585 --> 15:36.022
[chuckles]

15:43.725 --> 15:46.119
[music continues]

16:13.537 --> 16:14.843
Sweetie, what's wrong?

16:16.192 --> 16:18.281
You lied to me
about my mother.

16:26.115 --> 16:27.116
[car beeps]

16:28.204 --> 16:29.292
May I help you?

16:29.379 --> 16:30.685
Roger Nixon,
"Metropolis Inquisitor."

16:31.773 --> 16:33.296
Get off my car.

16:33.383 --> 16:34.558
It's a hell of a picture, Lex.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.386
You know, it really
boosted our sales.

16:36.473 --> 16:39.172
I've read comic books with
less fiction than your rag.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.565
Well, how about this?
Is this fiction?

16:41.652 --> 16:44.003
It's your juvenile record.
Fascinating reading.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.569
That must have taken
a Brinks truck

16:45.656 --> 16:47.441
of your dad's money to keep
those people quiet.

16:47.528 --> 16:48.920
Those records are sealed.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.313
I'm a resourceful guy.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.361
You know, I saw that
picture yesterday

16:54.448 --> 16:56.189
and it got me to thinking
of a follow-up.

16:56.276 --> 16:59.279
"Lex Luthor's Wild Youth
In Metropolis."

16:59.366 --> 17:01.107
Does the name Club Zero
ring a bell?

17:01.194 --> 17:03.239
You print one word
about that, I'll sue.

17:03.326 --> 17:04.762
Lawsuits take years.

17:04.849 --> 17:06.112
The genie will be
out of the bottle

17:06.199 --> 17:07.722
and all the people will know

17:07.809 --> 17:09.245
that the new and improved

17:09.332 --> 17:10.942
Lex Luthor is nothing
but a facade.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.944
[chuckles]

17:13.032 --> 17:15.425
You know what I think, Rog?

17:15.512 --> 17:17.514
If you wanted to print that, it
would already be in the paper.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.517
I think you're looking
for a payoff.

17:20.604 --> 17:22.998
It's a business proposition.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.566
A $100,000, and these records
will disappear forever.

17:25.653 --> 17:29.309
I'd question your integrity,
but you're a journalist.

17:29.396 --> 17:32.790
Did your father really think
he could hide you here forever?

17:32.877 --> 17:34.966
You've got 24 hours, and
this hits the front page.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.058
[tires screeching]

17:47.501 --> 17:49.111
Lana, I didn't lie to you.

17:49.198 --> 17:50.808
I told you your mother
would have been proud of you

17:50.895 --> 17:53.768
and she would have.
She loved you.

17:55.509 --> 17:56.945
You told me a fairy tale

17:57.032 --> 17:58.773
about a woman who
led the perfect life

17:58.860 --> 18:00.992
but that life was a lie.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.385
'You said
she loved cheerleading.'

18:02.472 --> 18:04.692
She hated it,
but was afraid to quit.

18:04.779 --> 18:06.563
She didn't even want
to stay in Smallville.

18:06.650 --> 18:09.436
- She wanted to see the world.
- What should I have told you?

18:09.523 --> 18:12.439
- Your mother was unhappy?
- I would have liked the truth.

18:12.526 --> 18:15.572
I told you what I thought
you could handle.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.531
Your mother was like
any other teenager.

18:17.618 --> 18:19.663
She had her ups and her downs.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.926
I feel like I spent my entire
life trying to measure up

18:22.013 --> 18:24.407
to a Laura Lang
who didn't exist.

18:24.494 --> 18:27.976
You're reading the diary
of a 17-year-old girl.

18:28.063 --> 18:30.979
It's a snapshot.
It's one time in her life.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.894
It's like I wrote this myself.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.550
The truth is, your
mother was the brightest

18:36.637 --> 18:38.726
most beautiful girl
in her class.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.728
Do you know she was picked
to give the graduation speech?

18:42.599 --> 18:44.427
I guess the diary ended
before that happened.

18:46.299 --> 18:49.040
You should have heard the
speech she gave that day.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.434
What did she say?

18:51.521 --> 18:52.870
Everything that
had been bubbling up

18:52.957 --> 18:55.308
inside of her for 18 years.

18:55.395 --> 18:57.440
She said she felt
suffocated in Smallville.

18:59.486 --> 19:00.748
Do you have a copy?

19:00.835 --> 19:02.663
No.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.055
But I'll never forget
the first line.

19:05.579 --> 19:06.710
"I never made
a difference here..

19:08.147 --> 19:09.844
...but maybe my children can."

19:22.552 --> 19:23.727

19:44.574 --> 19:45.619
[Chloe]
'Hello, Clark.'

19:47.142 --> 19:48.448
[snaps fingers]
Hello.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.406
Is everything okay?

19:50.493 --> 19:52.930
You guys ever notice anything
strange about Tina Greer?

19:54.976 --> 19:56.673
Nothing that would require
the intense concentration

19:56.760 --> 19:58.414
you're exerting to look at her.

19:58.501 --> 20:01.156
Mnm-mnm. The only thing weird
about Tina is the amount of time

20:01.243 --> 20:02.810
she spends idolizing Lana.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.899
Yeah.
She's practically her clone.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.074
[Chloe giggles]

20:06.901 --> 20:09.033
Come. Let's go.

20:20.654 --> 20:22.046
Lana!

20:22.133 --> 20:24.310
I swear that girl's
got you Lojacked.

20:24.397 --> 20:26.964
How do you like the sweater?

20:27.051 --> 20:28.879
It's great.
I've got one just like it.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.577
I know.
I got it at the same store.

20:30.664 --> 20:32.405
I've been going
on a shopping spree.

20:32.492 --> 20:33.971
Hey, look, I even
found this emerald

20:34.058 --> 20:35.321
necklace in the antique store.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.149
Why am I not surprised?

20:40.717 --> 20:42.066
See you at lunch.

20:43.503 --> 20:44.678
Hey, are you okay?

20:44.765 --> 20:46.288
I stopped by your
house earlier

20:46.375 --> 20:48.595
and Nell said you weren't
in the best mood, so..

20:48.682 --> 20:50.161
I'm fine.
Don't worry about it.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.599
Good, because I need a favor.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.557
My mom's moving
to Metropolis full-time

20:54.644 --> 20:56.298
but she says she doesn't
wanna pull me out of school

20:56.385 --> 21:00.259
so I was thinking
I can move in with you and Nell.

21:01.695 --> 21:03.262
For how long?

21:03.349 --> 21:05.264
I don't know. A couple months.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.048
I mean,
my mom would pay you guys.

21:07.135 --> 21:08.441
Trust me,
money is not a problem.

21:08.528 --> 21:10.660
Just name your price.

21:10.747 --> 21:13.576
I could even get a horse.
Uh, we could go riding together.

21:13.663 --> 21:15.230
I mean, wouldn't that be cool?

21:15.317 --> 21:17.798
Yeah. Uh, just give me some
time to think about it.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.671
Are you sure your mom's
okay with this?

21:21.758 --> 21:23.020
Of course.

21:23.107 --> 21:25.414
She knows
that we're best friends.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.286
It was her idea.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.462
Well, just let me
run it by Nell first.

21:29.549 --> 21:33.204
- She's kind of particular--
- Nell loves me.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.816
Look, I don't understand.
I thought that you'd be happy.

21:35.903 --> 21:37.470
I mean, people even
say that we look alike.

21:37.557 --> 21:38.993
We could be sisters.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.343
I'm just not sure
it's such a good idea.

21:41.430 --> 21:42.736
Oh!

21:42.823 --> 21:45.347
[chuckles]
Okay, I see.
So it was all a lie?

21:45.434 --> 21:48.045
Were you just pretending to like
me, and then when I come to you

21:48.132 --> 21:50.004
in my hour of need,
you're just gonna blow me off?

21:50.091 --> 21:51.701
Tina, calm down.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.834
No, you should have
said yes, Lana.

21:53.921 --> 21:55.488
It would have been perfect.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.711
[instrumental music]

22:23.907 --> 22:26.301
[instrumental music]

22:44.493 --> 22:46.016
[Tina]
'Clark!'

22:46.103 --> 22:47.757
What's your glitch, huh?

22:47.844 --> 22:48.802
Why do you keep staring at me?

22:48.889 --> 22:50.673
Uh...I don't know.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.198
Sorry.

22:56.157 --> 22:57.158
[intense music]

23:00.204 --> 23:02.293
Clark, what are you
doing home so early?

23:02.381 --> 23:04.078
Having more vision problems?

23:04.165 --> 23:05.906
I controlled it.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.386
Once. Sort of.

23:07.473 --> 23:08.952
I concentrated,
and it worked.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.650
- That's great!
- What'd you concentrate on?

23:10.737 --> 23:13.566
- Tina Greer's locker.
- What did you see?

23:13.653 --> 23:15.306
The money from
the bank robbery.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.787
[instrumental music]

23:29.582 --> 23:30.670
[doorbell chimes]

23:34.935 --> 23:36.632
Oh, I was just locking up,
deputies.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.286
Uh, how can I help you?

23:38.373 --> 23:40.288
We're looking for your daughter.

23:40.375 --> 23:42.769
Oh, she hasn't come home yet.
Uh, what's the problem?

23:42.856 --> 23:45.162
The money stolen from
the Smallville Savings and Loan

23:45.249 --> 23:47.556
was recovered in her school
locker this afternoon.

23:47.643 --> 23:49.340
You're kidding.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.820
My Tina?

23:50.907 --> 23:53.083
How could she be
involved in this?

23:53.170 --> 23:55.346
Well, that's what
we'd like to ask her.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.827
Would you bring her down to the
station when she gets home?

23:57.914 --> 24:01.135
Well, certainly. We'll cooperate
in any way we can.

24:01.222 --> 24:02.571
Uh, by the way

24:02.658 --> 24:04.791
who told you the money
was in her locker?

24:04.878 --> 24:06.575
Some kid with an anonymous tip.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.325
Clark, what are you doing?

24:17.412 --> 24:20.415
I'm just trying to figure out
how much change I have inside.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.156
You could always take
it out and count it.

24:25.028 --> 24:27.030
Where's the fun in that?

24:27.117 --> 24:28.815
Did you hear about Tina?

24:28.902 --> 24:30.556
They found the money from
the robbery in her locker.

24:31.774 --> 24:33.602
Really?

24:33.689 --> 24:35.430
She actually
cornered me today

24:35.517 --> 24:38.085
and asked if she could
come live with me and Nell.

24:38.172 --> 24:40.304
Just what you need,
a bank robbing roommate.

24:40.391 --> 24:42.437
I told her it wasn't
such a good idea.

24:42.524 --> 24:43.438
I've got enough
problems with Nell

24:43.525 --> 24:45.788
without adding
more to the mix.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.573
I always thought you and
your aunt were really close.

24:49.313 --> 24:51.315
She wants me to be
something I'm not.

24:54.057 --> 24:55.885
It's like having
a dual identity.

24:55.972 --> 24:59.236
There's the person
that everybody sees..

24:59.323 --> 25:00.934
