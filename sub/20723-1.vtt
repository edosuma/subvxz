00:18.953 --> 00:24.025
There is a place up north, far north.

00:24.058 --> 00:26.928
A place called Wolf country.

01:27.789 --> 01:29.524
When I heard that
wolves had been removed

01:29.558 --> 01:31.626
from the endangered species list,

01:31.660 --> 01:35.630
after 40 years of protection,
I was surprised.

01:35.664 --> 01:37.432
As I knew we only had
a few thousand wolves

01:37.466 --> 01:39.601
left in the country.

01:39.634 --> 01:41.570
And it troubled me that we were still

01:41.603 --> 01:43.672
so divided in our thinking

01:43.705 --> 01:47.342
about this highly intelligent species.

01:47.376 --> 01:49.978
So I decided to travel to places

01:50.011 --> 01:52.447
where they still could be found

01:52.481 --> 01:56.050
and talk to people who knew
and studied them,

01:56.084 --> 01:58.753
and somehow try to understand why

01:58.787 --> 02:01.890
there were those who still
feared and misunderstood them.

02:10.632 --> 02:13.034
Wow, it's a beautiful day.

02:13.067 --> 02:15.470
And we're headed up
to northern Minnesota

02:15.504 --> 02:18.440
to go see Jim Brandenburg.

02:18.473 --> 02:20.709
Jim Brandenburg has been photographing

02:20.742 --> 02:23.678
and writing about wolves
for over 45 years.

02:25.680 --> 02:28.383
He's known all over the world
for his study of wolves.

02:30.852 --> 02:33.021
This is a really unique area
that we're going to.

02:33.054 --> 02:37.091
It's... it's actually
called wolf country,

02:37.125 --> 02:42.163
and where Jim lives, it borders on
the boundary waters canoe area,

02:42.196 --> 02:44.866
which has a million
acres of pure wilderness.

02:47.802 --> 02:50.839
Being out here, it's very
different from where I grew up.

02:50.872 --> 02:52.574
You can see all kinds of wildlife.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.142
You can see eagles,

02:54.175 --> 02:57.546
and if you're lucky,
you might even see a wolf.

03:01.516 --> 03:03.752
This is northern Minnesota.

03:03.785 --> 03:07.622
It definitely takes
a unique and hearty person

03:07.656 --> 03:08.957
to live out here.

03:31.613 --> 03:33.682
Everybody's up here
for a different reason.

03:33.715 --> 03:37.185
My reason was to be close to the
wilderness and to photograph wolves.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.919
Or to see wolves, I didn't
have to photograph them,

03:38.920 --> 03:41.923
I just want to be around them.

03:41.956 --> 03:44.526
And it evolved, it took me years,

03:44.559 --> 03:46.928
many, many years to get
some decent photographs,

03:46.961 --> 03:49.898
so it wasn't a practical consideration,

03:49.931 --> 03:54.035
it wasn't a job, or a career move

03:54.068 --> 03:55.637
to come up here and photograph wolves,

03:55.670 --> 03:58.807
and do posters and do
books and do movies.

03:58.840 --> 04:02.143
It was just an intuitive
fire inside of me.

04:24.032 --> 04:26.901
I got into photographing
wolves and telling their story

04:26.935 --> 04:29.904
because I thought they were the most
persecuted animal in the world.

04:29.938 --> 04:33.842
More than lions, more than tigers,

04:33.875 --> 04:36.545
I really believe the wolf...
the wolf's reputation

04:36.578 --> 04:40.214
is worst, misplaced reputation
of any animal in the world.

04:40.248 --> 04:42.851
And I thought, there's a story.

04:51.092 --> 04:53.895
1968,

04:53.928 --> 04:58.032
about a mile from here, I
was walking with my camera,

04:58.066 --> 05:03.772
Nikon F manual exposure
with a 300-millimeter lens,

05:03.805 --> 05:06.741
snowshoes, on lake Juan

05:06.775 --> 05:10.144
at the end of the Fernwood
trail, which is right here,

05:10.178 --> 05:13.815
I saw a wolf before it saw me.

05:13.848 --> 05:16.885
I fell down onto the ice and the snow,

05:16.918 --> 05:18.720
crouching, thinking maybe, maybe

05:18.753 --> 05:19.853
I can sneak up on this wolf,

05:19.854 --> 05:21.055
maybe the wolf won't see me.

05:21.089 --> 05:25.026
The wolf kept coming, the wolf saw me,

05:25.059 --> 05:28.229
and it said,
"ah, is that food, is that a beaver?"

05:28.262 --> 05:30.198
"Is that a dead moose?
Is that a dead deer,

05:30.231 --> 05:32.801
is it... what is that thing?"

05:32.834 --> 05:35.704
The wolf started stalking me,
you think I was excited?

05:35.737 --> 05:38.673
That's one of my first
encounters with a wolf,

05:38.707 --> 05:40.675
and I was stalked by a wolf.

05:40.709 --> 05:42.010
I have photographs to prove it.

05:42.043 --> 05:43.678
Not just a story.

05:43.712 --> 05:45.647
I cherish those photographs,

05:45.680 --> 05:47.380
but you should see the look
in that wolf's face

05:47.381 --> 05:50.151
when it finally decided
that I was a human.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.756
That's when I knew that
wolves were slightly

05:51.757 --> 05:53.220
different than what I thought they were.

05:53.221 --> 05:55.356
I could see all the embarrassment

05:55.389 --> 05:58.593
condensed in one expression,
and walking away,

05:58.627 --> 06:01.996
like, "well you fooled me for a second,
but don't tell anybody."

06:02.030 --> 06:04.332
That whole...

06:04.365 --> 06:06.134
the series of photographs is precious,

06:06.167 --> 06:08.169
I never even published it.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.071
Steve Piragis and his wife

06:10.104 --> 06:12.907
have lived up on the edge of
the boundary waters canoe area

06:12.941 --> 06:14.809
for over 35 years,

06:14.843 --> 06:17.311
outside of a town called Ely, Minnesota,

06:17.345 --> 06:19.948
which is the closest town
to wolf country,

06:19.981 --> 06:24.185
with a population of 3,500 people.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.120
They came and fell in love
with the wilderness

06:26.154 --> 06:28.923
and decided to make it
their permanent home.

06:28.957 --> 06:31.025
Now it's their backyard.

06:31.059 --> 06:32.661
They have an outfitting company,

06:32.694 --> 06:34.629
Piragis northwoods company,

06:34.663 --> 06:36.264
where they lead canoe excursions,

06:36.297 --> 06:39.200
including howling for wolves canoe trip.

06:44.105 --> 06:46.307
You know, I mean,
we enjoy that we live in a place

06:46.340 --> 06:48.943
that's wild enough that
we have wild wolves

06:48.977 --> 06:51.179
in our neighborhood,
and we hear 'em howling,

06:51.212 --> 06:55.016
and I mean, I had a great
experience with wolves, myself,

06:55.049 --> 06:57.385
oh, just a half... oh, about
a mile actually, from here,

06:57.418 --> 07:00.955
when I was out on a run,
very unusual opportunity

07:00.989 --> 07:02.957
to see wolves close up.

07:02.991 --> 07:04.993
There was, uh... two adults

07:05.026 --> 07:08.329
and two... two very young pups.

07:08.362 --> 07:10.665
Uh, it was in may, so it was probably...

07:10.699 --> 07:13.334
they were probably
six or eight weeks old,

07:13.367 --> 07:16.805
and they were down in kind
of a hollow in a clear cut,

07:16.838 --> 07:18.238
so I could... as I ran along the road,

07:18.239 --> 07:20.008
I could see these four wolves,

07:20.041 --> 07:21.943
two adults, two pups.

07:21.976 --> 07:23.845
And, uh... they saw me,

07:23.878 --> 07:26.014
and the mom, I assume the mom,

07:26.047 --> 07:27.916
kind of a large Grey wolf,

07:27.949 --> 07:29.382
and the other one's a very dark wolf,

07:29.383 --> 07:30.952
much smaller, um,

07:30.985 --> 07:33.354
the mom kind of scurried
up into the woods

07:33.387 --> 07:37.325
and made a high-pitched caw, a very
high-pitched screaming kind of caw,

07:37.358 --> 07:40.328
and everybody followed her up into
the woods. The babies stopped,

07:40.361 --> 07:41.829
they were just rolling over each other

07:41.830 --> 07:43.932
like two little pups having fun,

07:43.965 --> 07:46.100
and the mom started,
you know, alerting them,

07:46.134 --> 07:48.102
and they walked up into
the woods together.

07:48.136 --> 07:50.204
So I go around the backside of the hill,

07:50.238 --> 07:52.173
and I imitated this little sound,

07:52.206 --> 07:56.244
this... this high-pitched
call that the mom was doing,

07:56.277 --> 07:59.280
and lo and behold, out of the
woods come the two pups.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.481
Like right to me,

08:00.514 --> 08:03.384
right within four feet of me.

08:03.417 --> 08:07.055
And... they... you know, they thought
I was the mom calling to them.

08:07.088 --> 08:09.724
So, uh, I said, wow, this is...

08:09.758 --> 08:11.359
this is pretty neat,

08:11.392 --> 08:13.995
and, uh... within seconds later,

08:14.028 --> 08:16.297
the trees kind of
start shaking down the hill,

08:16.330 --> 08:18.099
and down the hill comes the mom,

08:18.132 --> 08:22.336
making a... a show of it
by shaking the trees.

08:22.370 --> 08:26.207
Shows up right in front
of me with the two pups,

08:26.240 --> 08:28.843
looks at me, and runs away.

08:28.877 --> 08:30.344
And I thought, that's fairly unusual

08:30.378 --> 08:33.014
for the mom to run away.

08:33.047 --> 08:36.885
And a couple seconds later,
back she comes,

08:36.918 --> 08:39.153
same thing, trees shaking, you know,

08:39.187 --> 08:41.255
and this time she stands over the pups,

08:41.289 --> 08:44.025
I'm probably 12 feet away at the most.

08:44.058 --> 08:45.526
Stands over the pups,

08:45.559 --> 08:47.796
all of the hackles on the back
of her neck come up,

08:47.829 --> 08:50.264
her head low... lowers down,
she's looking straight at me,

08:50.298 --> 08:52.901
and goes "woof."

08:52.934 --> 08:55.136
And I said, you know, intellectually,

08:55.169 --> 08:57.005
that was the one time
I was a little afraid

08:57.038 --> 08:58.973
Of wolves.

09:06.014 --> 09:08.449
The place we meet wolves
for the first time

09:08.482 --> 09:12.320
is in that fantastic story
of little red riding hood.

09:12.353 --> 09:15.223
And it's not a very
complimentary story to wolves,

09:15.256 --> 09:18.860
it in fact is one of the
first fear characters

09:18.893 --> 09:20.862
that we, as children, engage with.

09:25.266 --> 09:27.328
These all relate to some
of the myths around

09:27.330 --> 09:29.071
wolves. And... and they're dangerous,

09:29.103 --> 09:31.205
because they're not accounts
of the actual wolves,

09:31.239 --> 09:33.842
they're not accounts F real, live wolves

09:33.875 --> 09:35.509
and the behaviors that wolves engage in.

09:50.959 --> 09:54.128
My God!

09:54.162 --> 09:56.530
No!

09:56.564 --> 09:59.167
The werewolf, the loup-garou, was...

09:59.200 --> 10:02.036
was a... is a mischievous creature

10:02.070 --> 10:04.138
that will come at night
and steal your shoes.

10:04.172 --> 10:06.274
So you wake up in the
morning, where are my shoes?

10:06.307 --> 10:09.177
Oh, they took it, right,
and so you go into the forest

10:09.210 --> 10:12.090
looking for this creature that is
hiding behind the tree with your shoes.

10:15.649 --> 10:19.153
And all of a sudden,
it became this, you know,

10:19.187 --> 10:21.289
blood-thirsty animal
that will steal your kid,

10:21.322 --> 10:23.824
not your shoes.

10:27.962 --> 10:30.131
The risk of being injured,

10:30.164 --> 10:33.201
or killed by a wolf
is... is... is minuscule.

10:33.234 --> 10:34.635
If you are afraid of a wolf,

10:34.668 --> 10:37.038
your car keys
should be taken away from you,

10:37.071 --> 10:39.139
because you're far more likely
to get in a car wreck,

10:39.140 --> 10:40.975
you shouldn't step in an airplane,

10:41.009 --> 10:43.945
you shouldn't go outside if there's
lightning anywhere nearby,

10:43.978 --> 10:46.179
these are all far, far more common
causes of injury and death.

10:46.180 --> 10:50.184
And so wolves, simply, uh, are
not a threat to human beings,

10:50.218 --> 10:53.054
it's just a... it's a
silly thing to think so.

10:54.288 --> 10:55.289
The wolf made a decision

10:55.323 --> 10:58.159
to join the human family.

10:58.192 --> 11:01.162
Somehow, someway, because they fit in.

11:01.195 --> 11:06.434
Why did the wolf come into the human
family 40... 50... 60,000 years ago,

11:06.467 --> 11:08.402
and the cat didn't, or the horse didn't?

11:08.436 --> 11:11.205
Because it seemed to be a little
more of an easy partnership.

11:11.239 --> 11:13.074
They blended in a little bit better.

11:13.107 --> 11:15.977
That was a decision that the wolf made

11:16.010 --> 11:17.946
for sustainability and survivability.

11:17.979 --> 11:19.312
Do you think there are
more dogs in the world

11:19.313 --> 11:21.482
than wolves right now?

11:21.515 --> 11:25.019
How many millions and millions
of dogs are there in the world?

11:25.053 --> 11:27.355
That's... that's the wolf.

11:27.388 --> 11:29.357
The wolf decided that somehow.

11:34.996 --> 11:37.999
It's clear that the evolution
of the wolf to the dog

11:38.032 --> 11:40.935
has had a huge impact on man.

11:40.969 --> 11:43.671
Think of the many gifts from the wolf.

11:43.704 --> 11:47.375
Seeing eye dogs, service animals,

11:47.408 --> 11:49.978
even companionship.

11:50.011 --> 11:52.413
Scientific studies have even proven

11:52.446 --> 11:55.516
that people live longer that have dogs.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.019
And the wolf is more intelligent,

11:58.052 --> 12:01.222
has advanced senses, and a bigger brain.

12:01.255 --> 12:04.325
We're similar to them,
they're not similar to us.

12:04.358 --> 12:09.430
It's very interesting, because I mean,
we learn our initial programming,

12:09.463 --> 12:11.532
a lot of it, we learn from them.

12:11.565 --> 12:15.036
On average, a wolf walks for
about eight hours of every day,

12:15.069 --> 12:16.437
and they can walk at quite a clip,

12:16.470 --> 12:19.073
they can walk
at four to six Miles an hour,

12:19.107 --> 12:21.976
and so if you wanna know what
it's like to be a wolf, walk.

12:22.010 --> 12:25.713
And just keep walking, and walk and
walk and walk. Walk day after day.

12:25.746 --> 12:29.183
This is a big, big part of what the life
of a wolf is all about, is walking.

12:29.217 --> 12:30.451
It's the simplest thing.

12:30.484 --> 12:32.553
And the next most important thing

12:32.586 --> 12:36.424
is... is also something that's very,
very closely related to humans,

12:36.457 --> 12:38.591
is just that wolves live in
families, they live in packs.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.694
And a pack is basically a family unit,

12:40.728 --> 12:43.697
and while wolves spend about eight
hours of every day walking,

12:43.731 --> 12:47.535
they spend about eight hours of every
day socializing with their pack mates.

12:47.568 --> 12:49.637
And so if you like living
in your family,

12:49.670 --> 12:53.541
and if you like walking, you have a
great deal in common with wolves,

12:53.574 --> 12:56.477
and the next most important
thing to know about wolves

12:56.510 --> 12:58.612
is how it is that they get their food.

12:58.646 --> 13:01.182
They eat things that are
generally bigger than them.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.517
Sometimes up to 10 times their size.

13:03.551 --> 13:06.720
And so wolves capture their
food, whether it's a moose,

13:06.754 --> 13:10.458
or a deer, or an elk, they do it
by killing it with their teeth.

13:10.491 --> 13:14.662
Imagine killing something that's 10
times your size with your teeth,

13:14.695 --> 13:17.131
and that's the only way
you're gonna get to eat.

13:17.165 --> 13:20.734
And so it's incredibly heroic,
it's incredibly dangerous

13:20.768 --> 13:23.237
uh, to be able to get food in this way.

13:23.271 --> 13:28.076
Um, wolf is capable of living
to about 12 years of age,

13:28.109 --> 13:31.279
but their life expectancy
is about four years of age,

13:31.312 --> 13:33.681
and one of the most common
causes of death is starvation,

13:33.714 --> 13:35.649
the inability to get enough food,

13:35.683 --> 13:39.053
and it's just because it's
really hard to kill something

13:39.087 --> 13:45.059
that's 10 times your size
with your teeth.

13:45.093 --> 13:47.628
I grew up in this hunting culture

13:47.661 --> 13:50.164
where you defined
your worth, in some ways,

13:50.198 --> 13:51.598
by how many pheasants you could shoot,

13:51.599 --> 13:54.235
or how many ducks you could get,

13:54.268 --> 13:56.237
and what kind of a trophy you could get.

13:56.270 --> 13:59.107
The biggest buck
with the biggest antlers,

13:59.140 --> 14:01.509
and if you could go shoot a wolf,

14:01.542 --> 14:04.212
pfft, you're a real man.

14:04.245 --> 14:06.147
One day I found myself heading north

14:06.180 --> 14:08.282
with some friends
from Hardwick, Minnesota,

14:08.316 --> 14:11.285
they were probably 10
years older than me,

14:11.319 --> 14:12.679
they were going to go wolf hunting.

14:14.388 --> 14:16.557
Okay, it's not the ultimate animal,

14:16.590 --> 14:18.392
maybe it is back then.

14:18.426 --> 14:20.094
There was a bounty on wolves.

14:20.128 --> 14:22.696
A 50-dollar bounty.
What does that mean?

14:22.730 --> 14:27.301
It means that, culturally, it was
a value to kill them, right?

14:27.335 --> 14:29.670
So us naive prairie kids...

14:29.703 --> 14:33.341
I imagine they were in
their 20s, and I was 15...

14:33.374 --> 14:36.877
let's go up north, go look for
wolves, and go hunt them.

14:36.910 --> 14:40.448
So I had a m-1 carbine,
world war ii vintage

14:40.481 --> 14:44.385
that I got from NRA,
but I was a young boy

14:44.418 --> 14:47.121
expressing my cultural norm,

14:47.155 --> 14:48.588
and if I could go up and kill a wolf,

14:48.589 --> 14:51.325
I would be the hero of my town,

14:51.359 --> 14:54.662
it'd be in the newspaper,
there'd be pictures.

14:54.695 --> 14:56.764
So I went up north with
my friends and looked,

14:56.797 --> 15:00.634
walked through the woods, and... scared.

15:00.668 --> 15:03.704
Scared that I'd see a wolf,
scared that I wouldn't.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.938
I was good shot, and if I saw
one, I might have killed it.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.809
Didn't see one, didn't see any tracks.

15:11.579 --> 15:12.779
To me, the ultimate question is,

15:12.780 --> 15:15.583
why do you kill the things you love?

15:15.616 --> 15:16.683
I think it's a primal thing.

15:16.684 --> 15:19.153
It's a male thing.

15:19.187 --> 15:22.423
Uh, we go back 30,000 years
to the cave paintings

15:22.456 --> 15:25.926
in Glasgow and Southern France.

15:25.959 --> 15:29.463
Picasso said it's the most
beautiful art man's ever created,

15:29.497 --> 15:31.532
we can't even equal that.

15:31.565 --> 15:35.869
They love them, but they killed as
many as they could to eat them.

15:35.903 --> 15:39.440
So it's in our genes, I mean, for
thousands and thousands and thousands

15:39.473 --> 15:42.176
and thousands of years, we hunted.

15:42.210 --> 15:46.914
We forget that sometimes,
I think, in this century.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.682
It wasn't that long ago,

15:48.716 --> 15:52.286
we depended upon
the weapon bow and arrow,

15:52.320 --> 15:56.424
atlatl, spear, gun,

15:56.457 --> 15:59.360
to go out and keep our families alive

15:59.393 --> 16:01.595
and keep ourselves fed.

16:01.629 --> 16:03.364
Well we haven't evolved past that,

16:03.397 --> 16:05.366
we still have that strange
kind of an instinct

16:05.399 --> 16:07.501
we wanna quest, we wanna hunt,

16:07.535 --> 16:10.304
it's very powerful.

16:10.338 --> 16:11.804
Most of the stuff of what we do in life

16:11.805 --> 16:14.808
is a gradual slide into a consciousness,

16:14.842 --> 16:16.544
or a point of view.

16:16.577 --> 16:18.712
Some of us reach those points

16:18.746 --> 16:20.714
where something happens
one day and it changes,

16:20.748 --> 16:23.451
and you meet someone,

16:23.484 --> 16:26.687
you read a book, you watch a movie.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.323
This particular day, I was 14 years old,

16:29.357 --> 16:31.559
up in a state park
near Luverne, Minnesota

16:31.592 --> 16:34.995
where I grew up, and I was a
fox hunter at this point.

16:35.028 --> 16:38.499
I killed fox for a living,
and I liked it.

16:38.532 --> 16:41.369
The most... one of the most
exciting times of my life.

16:41.402 --> 16:43.904
Yet, I love fox.

16:43.937 --> 16:46.006
Outwit them.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.976
Not easy to kill a fox,
they're very smart.

16:49.009 --> 16:52.613
You have to be pretty good
at tracking and watching,

16:52.646 --> 16:54.948
and you have to be a good shot.

16:54.982 --> 16:59.253
But there's a certain point you
evolve somehow, you change.

16:59.287 --> 17:02.456
The camera just happened
to come into my life somehow,

17:02.490 --> 17:05.025
as the artist.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.795
I was up in the blue mountains
with my camera, instead of my gun,

17:09.497 --> 17:11.665
and I saw a fox off in the distance.

17:11.699 --> 17:15.469
Well I learned from an old
friend of mine, Jeff Cooney,

17:15.502 --> 17:18.339
10 years older than me,
that did the same thing,

17:18.372 --> 17:20.540
how to squeak like a mouse

17:20.574 --> 17:22.410
to make the fox think
there's a free meal,

17:22.443 --> 17:24.545
so I hid behind a rock and went...

17:26.079 --> 17:28.482
The fox came running, I peeked up,

17:28.516 --> 17:30.851
just as the fox came within
maybe 10 feet,

17:30.884 --> 17:34.288
made a click with my three-dollar
plastic Argus camera,

17:34.322 --> 17:35.789
I was like, "wow, that's amazing."

17:35.823 --> 17:38.892
Then I got a picture back a week later.

17:38.926 --> 17:42.363
You take it to the drugstore... black
and white film, it's a process,

17:42.396 --> 17:43.563
they come back with a little print,

17:43.564 --> 17:46.800
and magic.

17:46.834 --> 17:48.336
I shot the fox.

17:48.369 --> 17:49.803
I captured, there's my trophy.

17:49.837 --> 17:51.339
There's my bragging point.

17:51.372 --> 17:52.740
I don't have a fox skin,

17:52.773 --> 17:55.709
I have a photograph.
This is even better.

17:55.743 --> 17:59.847
I can put it on the wall
and the fox is still alive.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.749
It didn't take long.

18:01.782 --> 18:07.388
From that moment on,
it was a different story.

18:07.421 --> 18:10.057
And I'm still doing the same thing.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.460
I'm still a hunter.

18:12.493 --> 18:16.630
I'm... I'm still tricking
animals, sneaking up on them.

18:28.742 --> 18:30.978
Jim had met Will Steger in the 80's,

18:31.011 --> 18:35.082
and the two embarked on a well-known
expedition to the north pole.

18:35.115 --> 18:38.419
Jim had heard about the white
wolf not being afraid of man,

18:38.452 --> 18:42.356
and became fascinated with an idea
of a similar mission to the arctic.

18:42.390 --> 18:44.525
And the unique opportunity to document,

18:44.558 --> 18:46.527
and live with wolves in the wild.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.563
Less than 500 Miles from the north pole

18:49.597 --> 18:52.566
lies Canada's most distant frontier,

18:52.600 --> 18:54.868
Ellesmere island.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.541
Only someone with a passion for wolves

19:00.574 --> 19:04.412
would dream of tracking them
into this desolate land.

19:06.013 --> 19:10.083
One such person is
photographer Jim Brandenburg.

19:10.117 --> 19:12.486
Wolves have always
been a favorite animal of mine,

19:12.520 --> 19:14.587
and I suppose one of the reasons
they're my favorite animal

19:14.588 --> 19:16.724
is because they're so intelligent.

19:16.757 --> 19:20.494
That intelligence makes it, uh...
nearly impossible to film them

19:20.528 --> 19:21.729
in a more conventional place,

19:21.762 --> 19:24.565
say in the forested areas.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.867
And for some reason these arctic wolves

19:26.900 --> 19:28.702
have... have got a quality about them

19:28.736 --> 19:30.604
where they tolerated us very well,

19:30.638 --> 19:32.005
and it became clear

19:32.039 --> 19:34.074
that it would make a wonderful story.

19:41.782 --> 19:44.752
In 1986, Jim's white wolf premiered

19:44.785 --> 19:48.956
at the Sundance film festival and
won numerous prestigious awards.

19:50.724 --> 19:53.193
White wolf also became
a best-selling book,

19:53.226 --> 19:54.828
and was the cover story

19:54.862 --> 19:58.632
for the national geographic magazine.

19:58.666 --> 20:00.067
When I was involved in that,

20:00.100 --> 20:02.202
I felt this is the
highlight of my career,

20:02.235 --> 20:03.537
I will never equal it,

20:03.571 --> 20:06.006
except one thing maybe.

20:06.039 --> 20:09.510
If a bunch of aliens had
popped down on my property

20:09.543 --> 20:11.979
and said, "Jim, come with us
on our spaceship,

20:12.012 --> 20:13.681
we're gonna go off to another planet."

20:13.714 --> 20:15.549
I'm... I'm kidding.
It sounds funny,

20:15.583 --> 20:18.552
this is my... this is a
true conception I thought,

20:18.586 --> 20:20.988
when I was in the middle of
the white wolf experience,

20:21.021 --> 20:23.223
I thought, I will never equal this,

20:23.256 --> 20:24.625
and I was right.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.159
I've never equaled it since.

20:26.193 --> 20:30.097
Our tent, in research,

20:30.130 --> 20:34.034
was within a five-minute walk
of the den.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.670
Lived right with them, as a family.

20:36.704 --> 20:38.137
We had problems with the white wolves

20:38.138 --> 20:42.009
coming stealing
our stuff out of the tent.

20:42.042 --> 20:43.877
So, it's very different than here,

20:43.911 --> 20:47.114
the wolves up there were
kind of blase about humans.

20:47.147 --> 20:51.184
To see a wolf here, back
in those days, was rare.

20:51.218 --> 20:53.887
I know people in Ely that
spent a lifetime here

20:53.921 --> 20:56.790
and never saw a wild wolf.

21:03.196 --> 21:06.600
At times, it pays to speak wolf.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.080
The Alpha male, the leader of the pack,

21:20.113 --> 21:22.816
the father of the pups, the boss

21:22.850 --> 21:25.986
injured his paw for about three weeks.

21:26.019 --> 21:28.055
He was injured, couldn't really hunt.

21:28.088 --> 21:30.524
The rest of the pack took care of him.

21:30.558 --> 21:32.159
Saw it, I mean it was clear.

21:32.192 --> 21:35.663
They had babysitters,
scruffy, we called him.

21:35.696 --> 21:37.698
The pack would go off hunting.

21:37.731 --> 21:40.000
Scruffy around the pack
would be very submissive,

21:40.033 --> 21:44.805
and wolves are like humans. And
they beat up one another other,

21:44.838 --> 21:47.675
you see a weak one, that, uh, was the...

21:47.708 --> 21:50.544
the... in every class of 30 kids,

21:50.578 --> 21:52.546
there's always one kid
that everybody picks on.

21:52.580 --> 21:54.782
Not everybody, but, they get picked on.

21:54.815 --> 21:57.217
Wolf pack's the same way.

21:57.250 --> 22:00.320
This scruffy animal we called scruffy,

22:00.353 --> 22:02.556
the rest of the wolves
beat him up all the time.

22:02.590 --> 22:04.758
Constantly were picking
on him, and chewing on him,

22:04.792 --> 22:06.960
well when the rest
of the pack went off hunting,

22:06.994 --> 22:10.964
scruffy was the designated babysitter.
Scruffy did that to the pups.

22:10.998 --> 22:16.904
Scruffy was the big boss and it was very
subtle complex behavior with wolves.

22:16.937 --> 22:20.240
I saw stuff that mimicked
a lot of human behavior.

22:20.273 --> 22:23.777
Aunts and uncles, and children,
and brothers, and sisters

22:23.811 --> 22:25.879
taking care of the pack.

22:25.913 --> 22:30.951
Not just casually,
but very tight family unit.

22:30.984 --> 22:35.823
The very last day, as we packed up,

22:35.856 --> 22:38.626
the den was about seven Miles
away from the landing strip,

22:38.659 --> 22:42.730
a little... it was a very small
remote landing strip, and...

22:45.398 --> 22:47.635
we got in the airplane,
packed the stuff up,

22:47.668 --> 22:52.105
the lump in my throat was as
big as the airplane itself.

22:52.139 --> 22:55.075
I looked out the window, and there was
the family of wolves sitting there,

22:55.108 --> 22:57.745
like they were saying goodbye.

22:57.778 --> 23:01.181
Next to the landing
strip as we taxied off

23:01.214 --> 23:04.017
and took off.

23:04.051 --> 23:09.690
And I think of that as a story
that someone would make up,

23:09.723 --> 23:13.193
but on my mother's grave
it's a true story.

23:13.226 --> 23:15.195
I haven't been back since.

23:20.133 --> 23:24.004
In the words of author Barry Lopez,

23:24.037 --> 23:26.273
"and to approach them slowly in terms

23:26.306 --> 23:31.845
of the Western imagination
is really to deny the animal."

23:31.879 --> 23:34.314
"It behooves us to visit with the people

23:34.347 --> 23:38.218
whom we share a planet,
and an interest in wolves,

23:38.251 --> 23:41.955
but who themselves come
from a different time space,

23:41.989 --> 23:45.392
and who, so far as we know,

23:45.425 --> 23:50.698
are very much closer to the wolf
than we will ever be."

24:05.813 --> 24:08.115
James Taylor called one day,

24:08.148 --> 24:13.854
the singer, wanted me to help
him with an album cover.

24:13.887 --> 24:16.757
He wanted a wolf on the album
cover, and that surprised me.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.325
His album, "never die young."

24:24.331 --> 24:26.166
I didn't think he knew
much about wolves,

24:26.199 --> 24:27.434
but he knew a lot about wolves.

24:27.467 --> 24:29.903
Came up here and saw wolves.

24:29.937 --> 24:33.373
I asked him if he'd do a benefit
concert for wolves, and he said yes.

24:33.406 --> 24:36.143
We did two of them.
One in Minneapolis,

24:36.176 --> 24:38.445
one in Madison, Wisconsin.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.748
Raised some nice money,

24:40.781 --> 24:44.785
some of that money went to
the defenders of wildlife,

24:44.818 --> 24:47.855
defenders of wildlife leveraged
that up into a... a program

24:47.888 --> 24:52.726
to give the ratchers over
on Yellowstone an excuse

24:52.760 --> 24:55.829
to allow the reintroduction
of wolves into Yellowstone

24:55.863 --> 25:01.802
by paying for the cows that the wolves
killed off the park properties.

25:01.835 --> 25:04.204
So in a tiny, small way,

25:04.237 --> 25:08.408
James Taylor and I
had a fairly significant role

25:08.441 --> 25:13.280
in opening up that dam to let the
wolf be reintroduced to Yellowstone.

25:13.313 --> 25:17.384
We didn't know if the wolf would
survive in Yellowstone, particularly.

25:17.417 --> 25:19.753
They thrived.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.017
When the wolf returned to Yellowstone,

25:50.050 --> 25:53.320
after an absence of over 65 years,

25:53.353 --> 25:57.090
scientists discovered
an ecological phenomenon

25:57.124 --> 26:00.193
called the trophic cascade.

26:00.227 --> 26:03.831
"Trophic" refers to the
different levels of the food chain,

26:03.864 --> 26:06.967
plant being one, insects the next,

26:07.000 --> 26:08.401
all the way up the ladder.

26:08.435 --> 26:11.004
And the wolf had a cascading effect.

26:11.038 --> 26:14.107
The elk and deer grew stronger,

26:14.141 --> 26:18.011
the aspens and willows flourished,

26:18.045 --> 26:21.849
even the grass grew taller.

26:21.882 --> 26:26.954
And the most fascinating, was
that the rivers were covered,

26:26.987 --> 26:29.556
along with its many inhabitants.

26:32.525 --> 26:35.062
Despite being small in numbers,

26:35.095 --> 26:39.900
this top predator would not
only transform the ecosystem,

26:39.933 --> 26:43.070
but also, its physical geography.

26:46.439 --> 26:51.879
A magical story of ecology and a
missing piece being put back in.

26:51.912 --> 26:54.547
Sometimes I say once you break
something in the environment

26:54.581 --> 26:56.316
you can't fix it.

26:56.349 --> 26:59.086
That's magical.
I'm very proud of that.

26:59.119 --> 27:02.322
And every time you listen
to a James Taylor song,

27:02.355 --> 27:04.291
think of that and thank him.

27:13.466 --> 27:15.102
Good shot.

27:27.147 --> 27:29.449
That's the end of her.

27:29.482 --> 27:34.021
Then, in 2011, something shifted.

27:34.054 --> 27:35.989
Despite a sea-change of attitude

27:36.023 --> 27:38.425
about this iconic species,

27:38.458 --> 27:42.495
president Obama signed off
on de-listing the wolf.

27:42.529 --> 27:45.298
The same year,
state legislatures in the west

27:45.332 --> 27:47.935
pushed through a wolf
hunting and trapping bill

27:47.968 --> 27:52.139
that would put the collared wolves
in Yellowstone in jeopardy.

27:52.172 --> 27:56.143
Soon, gunshots were
reported around the globe,

27:56.176 --> 27:57.911
and millions mourn the death

27:57.945 --> 28:00.647
of the most famous wolf in the world.

28:00.680 --> 28:05.485
Researchers knew her
as the Alpha female 832f,

28:05.518 --> 28:09.156
but to many, she was known as 06.

28:10.623 --> 28:12.926
And this is where wolves are revealing

28:12.960 --> 28:16.429
in, in our... in humans,
what might be a great failing.

28:16.463 --> 28:18.465
And, and... the concern
is this basically,

28:18.498 --> 28:22.569
it's just that, as a country
we don't know how to answer

28:22.602 --> 28:25.005
this very simple question, which is,

28:25.038 --> 28:26.606
what is an endangered species?

28:26.639 --> 28:28.976
And there's definitely controversy

28:29.009 --> 28:30.577
about how to interpret that phrase

28:30.610 --> 28:34.281
and what it means,
but whatever it means,

28:34.314 --> 28:37.250
occupying 15% of the historic range

28:37.284 --> 28:40.487
could not possibly count as recovery.

28:47.260 --> 28:49.696
And snaring,
I wasn't even aware of snaring.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.198
I mean, I had heard of it.

28:51.231 --> 28:52.711
I learned about that during this time,

28:52.732 --> 28:57.404
and now I'm just so appalled
that 75% of the wolves

28:57.437 --> 28:59.339
that were killed during
the trapping season

28:59.372 --> 29:01.341
were killed by snaring.

29:01.374 --> 29:04.244
The trap itself is created in such a way

29:04.277 --> 29:08.015
that it will catch any animal
that steps into it.

29:08.048 --> 29:11.618
And that mean... would mean
not only the target animal,

29:11.651 --> 29:13.286
which in this instance
would be the wolf,

29:13.320 --> 29:18.091
but any other animal
that steps into that trap.

29:18.125 --> 29:19.492
A beautiful male coyote,

29:19.526 --> 29:21.128
a three-to four-year-old male coyote

29:21.161 --> 29:24.397
was caught in a wildlife services trap.

29:24.431 --> 29:27.667
And it appeared to us that this
animal had been in this trap,

29:27.700 --> 29:31.438
from the extent of
its injuries in the tissue,

29:31.471 --> 29:33.306
for anywhere from a week minimum,

29:33.340 --> 29:35.608
but possibly two weeks.

29:35.642 --> 29:38.478
As we investigated
the situation, looked around,

29:38.511 --> 29:41.114
we found other coyote tracks

29:41.148 --> 29:44.551
within his area, right around
him and in the snow around him.

29:44.584 --> 29:48.055
And what was interesting
is it appeared to us that

29:48.088 --> 29:50.423
possibly his mate, or another coyote,

29:50.457 --> 29:52.392
was actually helping him survive,

29:52.425 --> 29:55.362
was actually protecting him
against other predators,

29:55.395 --> 29:59.399
and probably bringing him food, too.

29:59.432 --> 30:01.568
If the American public saw this

30:01.601 --> 30:05.538
and understood the brutality
and the cruelty of this,

30:05.572 --> 30:09.576
that this program would
be ended very quickly.

30:09.609 --> 30:13.346
I often ask people who abuse animals

30:13.380 --> 30:15.215
and do nasty things to animals,

30:15.248 --> 30:17.550
"would you do it to your dog?"

30:17.584 --> 30:19.786
And some people don't like to hear that

30:19.819 --> 30:22.722
because it puts them
in a very uneasy space.

30:22.755 --> 30:24.657
And, you know, thank goodness,

30:24.691 --> 30:27.694
if I've talked to somebody
who's, you know, trapped a wolf,

30:27.727 --> 30:30.097
shot a wolf, done something harm...

30:30.130 --> 30:34.301
poisoned prairie dogs,
um, harmed coyotes,

30:34.334 --> 30:36.836
and I say well,
"would you do it to you dog?"

30:36.869 --> 30:39.272
They go,
"well no, of course I wouldn't."

30:39.306 --> 30:42.475
And then I'll say, "well how come
you can do it to another animal

30:42.509 --> 30:45.178
who is also sentient and conscious

30:45.212 --> 30:46.546
and feels pain?"

30:46.579 --> 30:49.182
And oftentimes, with a lot of people,

30:49.216 --> 30:50.683
there's a pause.

30:50.717 --> 30:52.719
And it's an important pause, I think,

30:52.752 --> 30:54.821
because they haven't ever put their dog

30:54.854 --> 30:57.690
in the place of those animals.

31:06.399 --> 31:09.569
Following the de-listing
in the Yellowstone area,

31:09.602 --> 31:11.638
the wolf was about to face a new threat

31:11.671 --> 31:14.341
in the Great Lakes region.

31:14.374 --> 31:16.809
Senators Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar

31:16.843 --> 31:19.112
petitioned the interior secretary

31:19.146 --> 31:21.314
for the de-listing of
the wolf in Minnesota,

31:21.348 --> 31:25.152
and were calling for a
state-regulated wolf hunt.

31:26.919 --> 31:28.288
Senator Dibble.

31:28.321 --> 31:29.489
Thank you, Mr. President,

31:29.522 --> 31:31.358
we're not quite done with wolves, sorry.

31:31.391 --> 31:36.696
- Um, I have the a18 amendment.
- Senator dibble offers

31:36.729 --> 31:39.832
the a18 amendment, the secretary
will report the amendment.

31:39.866 --> 31:42.735
Senator dibble moves to
amend house file 2171 as amended

31:42.769 --> 31:46.439
pursuant to rule 45 adopted by
the senate April 17th, 2012,

31:46.473 --> 31:48.741
as follows, page 22 delete section 50,

31:48.775 --> 31:51.811
this is the a18 amendment.

31:51.844 --> 31:53.513
And it was very clear what the intent

31:53.546 --> 31:56.649
of that committee hearing was.

31:56.683 --> 32:01.888
It was to roll out a... a plan to hunt
wolves in the state of Minnesota.

32:01.921 --> 32:05.792
This is even before the
official de-listing occurred.

32:05.825 --> 32:09.262
The first hearing at the
legislature was January...

32:09.296 --> 32:12.899
was a day before the d-listing,
was January 26th.

32:12.932 --> 32:15.602
In the house and in the senate.

32:15.635 --> 32:17.804
The... the rush was on.

32:17.837 --> 32:19.506
The pressure was on.

32:19.539 --> 32:21.908
There was going to be a wolf hunt.

32:21.941 --> 32:24.777
The big agricultural groups,
the big hunting groups

32:24.811 --> 32:28.181
had done their homework,
had effectively lobbied

32:28.215 --> 32:30.717
all the chairs on the committees.

32:30.750 --> 32:33.820
Already had a plan
in place through the DNR

32:33.853 --> 32:37.424
to begin this hunt in 2012.

32:37.457 --> 32:40.493
The bill was rushed through,
it eventually was incorporated

32:40.527 --> 32:43.363
into the game and fish bill, there
was some debate on the floor,

32:43.396 --> 32:45.265
but it was just too late in the process

32:45.298 --> 32:46.766
for us to stop it.

32:46.799 --> 32:50.703
The authority that has been
working on... on wolves

32:50.737 --> 32:52.305
for many, many years,

32:52.339 --> 32:53.773
no... no question about it,

32:53.806 --> 32:56.709
there was no hesitation
on that particular call.

32:56.743 --> 33:00.480
It was asked directly on that
particular conference call

33:00.513 --> 33:02.815
if it is time to manage
wolves in Minnesota

33:02.849 --> 33:05.718
and this man said, "absolutely."

33:05.752 --> 33:07.820
And he said because of
the numbers, number one,

33:07.854 --> 33:09.789
and because the numbers...

33:09.822 --> 33:13.560
If they continue to grow
at the rate they are growing,

33:13.593 --> 33:17.530
they're gonna be causing
problems amongst themselves.

33:17.564 --> 33:20.667
Yes, so recently, the federal
government proposed to delist wolves

33:20.700 --> 33:21.901
throughout the lower 48,

33:21.934 --> 33:24.571
excepting for Mexican wolves.

33:24.604 --> 33:27.038
And whenever the federal government
makes a proposal like that,

33:27.039 --> 33:29.609
it has to go through
a scientific peer review.

33:29.642 --> 33:32.279
And so I was selected
to be a peer reviewer,

33:32.312 --> 33:33.846
along with a couple of others,

33:33.880 --> 33:36.949
and we were selected on the
basis of our credentials,

33:36.983 --> 33:39.552
on the basis of what
we knew about wolves.

33:39.586 --> 33:41.754
It was later discovered, uh...

33:41.788 --> 33:44.624
that myself and these
two colleagues of mine

33:44.657 --> 33:48.828
were not favorably disposed
to this particular proposal

33:48.861 --> 33:50.963
to delist wolves across the country.

33:50.997 --> 33:53.766
And when that was found out,
uh, we were uninvited

33:53.800 --> 33:57.404
to be panelists to review this document.

33:57.437 --> 34:00.773
And that created some controversy for
folks, because of course it's not a...

34:00.807 --> 34:03.310
a very sensible way
to go about a peer review,

34:03.343 --> 34:05.076
to just take people off
because you might not like

34:05.077 --> 34:07.380
the opinion that they would come to.

34:07.414 --> 34:10.049
And, um... and, this
really is just a symptom

34:10.081 --> 34:12.284
of a much bigger trouble uh,
that we have on the planet,

34:12.319 --> 34:15.722
we think that, uh... uh, life is
just full of a bunch of opinions,

34:15.755 --> 34:17.757
and one opinion is the same as another,

34:17.790 --> 34:21.628
and that's not the case. Uh, the thing
that makes a scientific opinion

34:21.661 --> 34:23.496
different from any other kind of opinion

34:23.530 --> 34:25.465
is just how well it's defended.

34:25.498 --> 34:28.534
And so it doesn't matter
what my opinion is,

34:28.568 --> 34:31.371
what matters is how well-reasoned it is,

34:31.404 --> 34:33.572
and how well-defended it is.

34:33.606 --> 34:35.742
Members, it's... it's very easy

34:35.775 --> 34:38.578
for those of you who live around here

34:38.610 --> 34:42.081
and you can watch
wolves on television, and...

34:42.114 --> 34:46.085
and, uh... but it's a lot
different for people

34:46.118 --> 34:48.788
that actually live in wolf country,

34:48.821 --> 34:51.090
where wolves live.

34:51.123 --> 34:54.827
Where parents are afraid
to leave their kids alone

34:54.860 --> 34:58.565
to wait for the school bus.

34:58.598 --> 35:00.733
I know one of the editors
of one of my newspapers

35:00.767 --> 35:03.603
and when she takes a walk at night,

35:03.636 --> 35:06.339
she carries a handgun with her.

35:08.641 --> 35:10.410
Because of wolves.

35:10.443 --> 35:12.512
The decision was made.

35:12.545 --> 35:14.914
And now to take it
away from these people

35:14.947 --> 35:17.384
that are so impassioned about the wolf,

35:17.417 --> 35:19.118
to kill the wolf.

35:19.151 --> 35:24.491
There's... as much passion as
you see to protect the wolf,

35:24.524 --> 35:26.393
there may be more passion,

35:26.426 --> 35:29.128
may be more, to kill the wolf.

35:29.161 --> 35:30.997
There may be.

35:31.030 --> 35:33.533
And it's... it's a laser-seeking,

35:33.566 --> 35:36.969
hot-point on a politician's skin.

35:37.970 --> 35:39.972
And they are just,

35:40.006 --> 35:43.042
it's... it's pathetic.

35:43.075 --> 35:46.045
Members, if you'd really like
to see what the wolves do

35:46.078 --> 35:47.780
in greater Minnesota,

35:47.814 --> 35:50.417
take a look online of the
picture of the young man

35:50.450 --> 35:52.485
that was taken out of his sleeping bag

35:52.519 --> 35:55.121
while he was camping
in northern Minnesota.

35:55.154 --> 35:58.057
And take a look at his skull,

35:58.090 --> 36:00.393
where there's staples,

36:00.427 --> 36:03.696
where the wolf took a big
chunk out of his head.

36:03.730 --> 36:06.032
A wolf attack is incredibly rare.

36:06.065 --> 36:09.536
Matter of fact, there's
only two recorded attacks

36:09.569 --> 36:12.639
in the entire United States
in over a hundred years.

36:12.672 --> 36:15.575
Now, the last one just happened
in Minnesota recently,

36:15.608 --> 36:17.944
and they... they shot
and killed the wolf,

36:17.977 --> 36:19.946
and then they... they
tested him for rabies,

36:19.979 --> 36:21.848
he did not have rabies,
but what he had was

36:21.881 --> 36:23.683
he had an incredibly deformed jaw

36:23.716 --> 36:25.518
which prevented him from hunting.

36:25.552 --> 36:28.054
He had been kicked out of his pack,

36:28.087 --> 36:31.724
and he was doing things
that are not normal

36:31.758 --> 36:34.527
wolf behavior for survival purposes.

36:34.561 --> 36:37.630
Management is very much needed.

36:37.664 --> 36:40.767
I suggest that we let
the DNR do their job,

36:40.800 --> 36:44.704
and for those of us that
live in greater Minnesota,

36:44.737 --> 36:47.006
where we have wolves,

36:47.039 --> 36:49.108
where we see wolves,

36:49.141 --> 36:51.010
they're not just little German Shepherds

36:51.043 --> 36:52.779
that live in your backyard.

36:52.812 --> 36:55.147
They're big wolves,
and they're a problem.

36:55.181 --> 36:57.750
I truly believe
that the problem comes from

36:57.784 --> 36:59.619
too many wolves.

36:59.652 --> 37:03.022
I'm not against the wolf,
the wolf is a beautiful animal

37:03.055 --> 37:05.057
when he's where he belongs.

37:05.091 --> 37:09.496
Um, but he's not that beautiful
when he's in my cow yard.

37:09.529 --> 37:13.800
We, um... I see a lot of
T-shirts around here today

37:13.833 --> 37:16.035
that says, "howling wolves" on it,

37:16.068 --> 37:18.905
um, you know if I'm laying
in my bed in a motel

37:18.938 --> 37:20.873
down here in the cities
and I hear a wolf howl,

37:20.907 --> 37:22.642
that's a beautiful sound,

37:22.675 --> 37:24.844
but when I'm layin' in my bed at home,

37:24.877 --> 37:27.013
and my wife and I hear a wolf howl,

37:27.046 --> 37:29.015
it means we better
hit the floor running,

37:29.048 --> 37:32.552
because he's probably after one
of our livestock in the yard.

37:32.585 --> 37:34.754
The concern that the
farmers have expressed

37:34.787 --> 37:37.256
is that their cattle or livestock

37:37.289 --> 37:39.125
will be taken by wolves.

37:39.158 --> 37:42.995
And as a result of that,
they supported wolf hunts

37:43.029 --> 37:46.499
in this state for many,
many years in Minnesota.

37:46.533 --> 37:48.835
We've gone back and we've reviewed

37:48.868 --> 37:51.871
some of the data on this.

37:51.904 --> 37:56.175
There are 165,000 cows and cattle

37:56.208 --> 37:58.811
in wolf territory
in the state of Minnesota.

37:58.845 --> 38:01.180
And that's the principle farming group

38:01.213 --> 38:03.249
that's concerned about depredation,

38:03.282 --> 38:05.752
or the taking of livestock by wolves.

38:05.785 --> 38:08.555
What we learned last year,
and this is very typical...

38:08.588 --> 38:13.159
in 2012, there were
only 81 verified cases

38:13.192 --> 38:16.763
of livestock losses
in the state of Minnesota.

38:16.796 --> 38:21.000
That's 81 out of 165,000.

38:21.033 --> 38:23.970
Now in our judgment, that doesn't
constitute the basis for a hunt.

38:24.003 --> 38:27.607
We understand farmers
are making a living,

38:27.640 --> 38:29.008
we understand many of these farmers

38:29.041 --> 38:32.278
are using non-lethal
techniques, not all,

38:32.311 --> 38:35.848
we strongly urge the USDA
to work more closely

38:35.882 --> 38:38.785
with these farmers,
and the DNR to ensure

38:38.818 --> 38:42.622
that they're taking all
non-lethal actions possible,

38:42.655 --> 38:46.192
and that could mean different
lighting techniques,

38:46.225 --> 38:48.995
flaggery, which is simply small flags

38:49.028 --> 38:50.763
that seem to discourage wolves,

38:50.797 --> 38:53.633
llamas, guard dogs, burroughs,

38:53.666 --> 38:56.235
we know they work, a lot
of research has been done,

38:56.268 --> 38:57.837
both in Minnesota and Wisconsin,

38:57.870 --> 38:59.138
and out west.

38:59.171 --> 39:00.907
Non-lethal methods are effective,

39:00.940 --> 39:02.775
but when they don't work,

39:02.809 --> 39:04.243
we understand the need at times

39:04.276 --> 39:05.945
to take offending wolves,

39:05.978 --> 39:08.748
but that doesn't constitute
the basis for a hunt.

39:08.781 --> 39:10.650
If you've got a wolf, you know,

39:10.683 --> 39:12.284
moving around your farm land,

39:12.318 --> 39:14.654
you need to do something
to strengthen your boundaries,

39:14.687 --> 39:17.690
and reinforce your territory,
so that wolf knows

39:17.724 --> 39:20.893
when he's transgressing
out of his range.

39:20.927 --> 39:23.362
There's the emotional level,

39:23.395 --> 39:25.665
where when our livestock
get predated on,

39:25.698 --> 39:27.900
that we don't overly react emotionally

39:27.934 --> 39:29.368
out of old stories.

39:29.401 --> 39:31.971
So it's negotiating that space, too.

39:32.004 --> 39:33.139
We got lots of folk who are,

39:33.172 --> 39:34.974
sort of, crazy wolf-lovers,

39:35.007 --> 39:37.644
and don't necessarily
always want to appreciate

39:37.677 --> 39:40.046
the reality of what
wolves mean in the world.

39:40.079 --> 39:43.182
Yes, they predate. They are hunters.
They're carnivores.

39:43.215 --> 39:49.922
I handed out for you a story
from the April 7th, 2012 edition

39:49.956 --> 39:52.090
and so you don't have to read
it, I'll just kind of read you

39:52.091 --> 39:54.994
a few quotes out of it.

39:55.027 --> 39:57.129
I had this constituent,
and this is what it says,

39:57.163 --> 39:59.866
she was pruning some
bushes near her deck,

39:59.899 --> 40:03.235
stood up and turned around, and quote,

40:03.269 --> 40:07.740
"and there was a big,
black wolf baring his teeth,

40:07.774 --> 40:12.211
very close, just a few feet away."

40:12.244 --> 40:14.013
She took a few steps towards the house,

40:14.046 --> 40:16.115
but to her dismay, she saw another wolf

40:16.148 --> 40:19.852
smaller, grey, and mangy-looking
about eight feet away,

40:19.886 --> 40:23.890
between her and the house.

40:23.923 --> 40:27.093
She slowly backed away from
both animals to her truck,

40:27.126 --> 40:28.761
as she unlocked her truck, she said,

40:28.795 --> 40:31.731
"the wolves hunched down
and growled at me."

40:31.764 --> 40:33.733
That's a quote.

40:33.766 --> 40:35.735
When she got into her truck,
she honked the horn,

40:35.768 --> 40:39.005
but the wolves stayed put

40:39.038 --> 40:41.674
and barked at her.

40:41.708 --> 40:43.776
Members, that's a real experience,

40:43.810 --> 40:46.245
that are happening, maybe not every day,

40:46.278 --> 40:48.214
but every week

40:48.247 --> 40:53.119
where wolves really live,
because they're over-populated.

40:53.152 --> 40:55.254
The secretary will take the roll.

41:04.030 --> 41:05.331
That was it, so,

41:05.364 --> 41:06.933
they were done, it was a done deal.

41:06.966 --> 41:08.366
And I wasn't sure
what I was going to do.

41:08.367 --> 41:10.269
I left there and I thought,
oh my goodness,

41:10.302 --> 41:12.872
what is going on? And I
approached the legislature,

41:12.905 --> 41:15.207
his name is representative David dill,

41:15.241 --> 41:17.877
he is a democrat out of crane lake,

41:17.910 --> 41:19.745
and I approached him
in the hall near the elevators

41:19.746 --> 41:21.413
and I said, have you considered

41:21.447 --> 41:23.783
the ecological benefits of the wolf?
You know,

41:23.816 --> 41:25.751
even if you're a hunter,
even if you're an angler,

41:25.752 --> 41:28.287
no matter who you are, whether
you're a wildlife viewer,

41:28.320 --> 41:33.893
a hunter, an angler, somebody who
believes in keeping ecology intact,

41:33.926 --> 41:37.196
you have to believe that the wolf
is a necessary part of that.

41:37.229 --> 41:40.867
And he basically said to me,
"oh, nobody's talked about that."

41:40.900 --> 41:42.533
And then he kind of caught
himself, 'cause he realized,

41:42.534 --> 41:45.471
well that's a reason
to have somebody testify.

41:45.504 --> 41:48.040
And he started panicking, seriously.

41:48.074 --> 41:50.176
He was running from the elevator button

41:50.209 --> 41:52.945
when it didn't come right away
to another elevator button,

41:52.979 --> 41:55.748
saying, "there will be
a wolf hunt this year."

41:55.782 --> 41:57.548
And I looked at him, 'cause
he like running away from me,

41:57.549 --> 41:59.185
and I was the only one in the hall,

41:59.218 --> 42:02.789
and I'm a short-statured,
small-statured woman,

42:02.822 --> 42:04.423
and he was much taller, and I said,

42:04.456 --> 42:06.358
I'm not chasing you.

42:06.392 --> 42:07.994
You don't have to run.

42:08.027 --> 42:11.063
But I think he knew that
he was basically facing

42:11.097 --> 42:13.165
what he was gonna face soon.

42:13.199 --> 42:14.767
This year, wolves lost

42:14.801 --> 42:16.936
their endangered species protection.

42:16.969 --> 42:19.038
Wolves keep forests and streams healthy,

42:19.071 --> 42:20.406
they're wilderness allies.

42:20.439 --> 42:22.909
50% of wolf pups die of starvation,

42:22.942 --> 42:24.443
and many wolves are poached.

42:24.476 --> 42:25.978
While Minnesota's original plan

42:26.012 --> 42:27.780
had a five-year waiting period,

42:27.814 --> 42:29.215
a new wolf hunting and trapping bill

42:29.248 --> 42:31.417
is now being passed by the legislature

42:31.450 --> 42:33.319
with no regard to its impact.

42:33.352 --> 42:35.487
We are recklessly
endangering our wolves.

42:35.521 --> 42:38.024
Tell governor Dayton
to stop the wolf hunt.

42:38.057 --> 42:41.193
We are about to lose all that
we worked so hard to save.

42:41.227 --> 42:43.195
Don't silence our wilderness.

42:54.273 --> 42:57.076
Studies suggest that
the wolf became the dog

42:57.109 --> 42:59.211
when wolves began to follow hunters

42:59.245 --> 43:02.281
to scavenge on the kills
that they had left behind.

43:02.314 --> 43:05.184
And in the process, some became isolated

43:05.217 --> 43:09.088
from other wolves, and
migrated along with people.

43:09.121 --> 43:11.523
And over time, the human family

43:11.557 --> 43:13.259
became their pack.

43:13.292 --> 43:15.094
Good girl.

43:15.127 --> 43:17.396
Say goodbye to mama, come up.

43:18.530 --> 43:20.867
I'm gonna miss you.

43:20.900 --> 43:22.869
Be good.

43:22.902 --> 43:25.071
Be a good girl.

43:25.104 --> 43:27.073
Okay.

43:33.980 --> 43:36.348
I think it's safe to say 700, at least,

43:36.382 --> 43:38.150
wolves were killed this season.

43:38.184 --> 43:40.119
So if you look at the rough numbers,

43:40.152 --> 43:43.422
it's about a fourth of the wolves.

43:43.455 --> 43:44.615
- Right? Is that fair?
- Yeah.

43:44.623 --> 43:47.226
A quarter of the wolves.
Yeah.

43:47.259 --> 43:49.428
So, you know, I guess the argument

43:49.461 --> 43:51.630
that a lot of people have
who are concerned about this

43:51.663 --> 43:53.565
is that that's a lot of wolves.

43:53.599 --> 43:56.168
- What...
- and even if it's a thousand,

43:56.202 --> 43:59.138
which would be a third
of the population...

43:59.171 --> 44:02.641
- which it could be.
- That's still within the range of...

44:02.674 --> 44:07.279
of what's been identified as, um...

44:07.313 --> 44:10.016
a number that...
that may be sustainable.

44:10.049 --> 44:13.252
Has anybody ever stud...
studied long-term effects

44:13.285 --> 44:15.487
on wolves and wolf packs when you go in

44:15.521 --> 44:20.192
and you start taking out pack members?

44:20.226 --> 44:26.498
There's been studies looking at...
at wolf pack dynamics, not specifically,

44:26.532 --> 44:30.202
not necessarily, you know,
measuring this influence

44:30.236 --> 44:32.504
of hunting or trapping, but, you know,

44:32.538 --> 44:35.607
through radio-collared
studies of wolves,

44:35.641 --> 44:38.477
there's been, um,

44:38.510 --> 44:40.980
documented, high turn-over rates

44:41.013 --> 44:43.482
in wolf packs.

44:43.515 --> 44:47.453
So there is a high
mortality level there,

44:47.486 --> 44:49.621
there already without
hunting and trapping,

44:49.655 --> 44:51.257
wolves can get hit by cars,

44:51.290 --> 44:53.960
they can get trapped
for depredation control,

44:53.993 --> 44:56.996
they get killed by other wolves,

44:57.029 --> 45:00.466
and there is this

45:00.499 --> 45:04.636
you know, pretty steady change-over
in wolf pack structure.

45:04.670 --> 45:06.505
But I've never...
I've never seen,

45:06.538 --> 45:07.639
and you may have something,

45:07.673 --> 45:09.075
but I've never seen,

45:09.108 --> 45:12.178
you know, long-term research done.

45:12.211 --> 45:14.411
'Cause we're talking statistics,
we're talking... right.

45:14.413 --> 45:16.315
Numbers...

45:16.348 --> 45:18.517
Yeah, I mean it's... and I...

45:18.550 --> 45:21.287
and yeah, there... that has not,

45:21.320 --> 45:24.690
like I said, has not been
studied specifically.

45:24.723 --> 45:26.425
Whether or not hunting and trapping

45:26.458 --> 45:30.963
has an influence on the
stability of wolf packs,

45:30.997 --> 45:32.331
population wide,

45:32.364 --> 45:33.966
I mean certainly on an individual level,

45:34.000 --> 45:38.704
you're gonna kill a breeding animal,

45:38.737 --> 45:41.107
but there's other animals
in the population

45:41.140 --> 45:42.660
that come in and replace those animals.

45:45.344 --> 45:47.679
The DNR never, um,

45:47.713 --> 45:49.648
brings any attention to that fact that,

45:49.681 --> 45:54.086
you know, it's not just
blatantly killing animals,

45:54.120 --> 45:56.088
it's... it's actually wiping out

45:56.122 --> 46:00.259
this very cohesive system
that packs have.

46:00.292 --> 46:02.628
We've lost sight of that
a bit in our thinking

46:02.661 --> 46:05.664
about management
of wildlife and management

46:05.697 --> 46:07.099
of wolves today.

46:07.133 --> 46:09.768
Clearly with the wolf hunt mentality,

46:09.801 --> 46:12.004
and talking to Dan stark at the DNR,

46:12.038 --> 46:13.572
you know, they think about...

46:13.605 --> 46:17.443
they think about the wolves
as, you know, just numbers.

46:17.476 --> 46:19.578
They don't think about them as being

46:19.611 --> 46:23.515
feeling, sentient beings who,

46:23.549 --> 46:27.153
if you take out... certainly if
you take out the top member,

46:27.186 --> 46:30.122
the breeding pair,
it's devastating to the pack,

46:30.156 --> 46:32.724
but even if you take out
other members of the pack,

46:32.758 --> 46:36.095
it's... it's not like you
come in and replace these,

46:36.128 --> 46:38.064
you can't replace a relationship.

46:38.097 --> 46:40.232
You can't... you can't replace the value

46:40.266 --> 46:45.171
that that one wolf has in the pack.

46:45.204 --> 46:48.507
Here is an array of portraits,

46:48.540 --> 46:53.512
wolves from the past
in the neighborhood.

46:53.545 --> 46:55.481
It was a core pack of eight or so,

46:55.514 --> 46:58.217
with 19 wolves that we counted

46:58.250 --> 47:01.120
over the years when this was done.

47:01.153 --> 47:03.222
These I think around 15,

47:03.255 --> 47:06.525
with just personal names
for me to remember.

47:06.558 --> 47:09.328
Broken foot, crooked ear,

47:09.361 --> 47:12.431
blind one-eye, beautiful one,

47:12.464 --> 47:14.166
this one was the papa.

47:14.200 --> 47:16.168
This was the Alpha male that was shot

47:16.202 --> 47:19.738
before the hunting
started, illegal hunting,

47:19.771 --> 47:22.674
it was shot illegally not far from here.

47:22.708 --> 47:27.446
I was very familiar with 19 wolves

47:27.479 --> 47:29.481
here on Ravenwood, one year,

47:29.515 --> 47:31.083
when they were really doing well.

47:31.117 --> 47:33.085
Lots of deer around.

47:33.119 --> 47:35.854
I photographed each one,
gave each one a name,

47:35.887 --> 47:37.323
had a little portrait of each one

47:37.356 --> 47:39.825
with a little name underneath.

47:39.858 --> 47:42.094
The Alpha male was killed by a hunter

47:42.128 --> 47:43.662
less than a mile from here.

47:43.695 --> 47:45.264
I know who did it.

47:45.297 --> 47:46.865
I asked them to be careful,

47:46.898 --> 47:49.201
I talked to them before the hunt.

47:49.235 --> 47:51.703
They were setting up their hunting camp,

47:51.737 --> 47:55.307
I said, please be careful, there
are a lot of wolves here,

47:55.341 --> 47:56.842
I know it's tempting.

47:56.875 --> 48:01.447
This is long before the wolf hunt.

48:01.480 --> 48:03.682
It's hard to talk about this.

48:03.715 --> 48:05.617
This was about three years ago.

48:05.651 --> 48:10.256
And, uh... we found that, uh...
the Alpha male, blackie,

48:10.289 --> 48:13.392
was killed of this pack,

48:13.425 --> 48:14.825
the wolf I'd been
photographing and watching

48:14.826 --> 48:18.397
for three, four years.

48:22.168 --> 48:25.904
Biggest footprint I've ever seen on
a wolf. Interesting looking wolf.

48:25.937 --> 48:28.540
He was pure black,
and I watched him turn grey.

48:40.819 --> 48:43.289
But he'd been radio-collared.

48:43.322 --> 48:47.559
The hunter didn't want
anyone to find out

48:47.593 --> 48:49.395
where he killed the wolf,

48:49.428 --> 48:51.697
so he snipped off the radio
collar and dropped it off

48:51.730 --> 48:54.900
near Ely to throw off the signal.

48:54.933 --> 48:57.269
I know, basically, who did it.

48:57.303 --> 48:59.371
Uh, changed my life,

48:59.405 --> 49:02.674
changed the wolf... the wolf pack
was totally different after that,

49:02.708 --> 49:04.710
totally, they seemed to disperse.

49:04.743 --> 49:06.578
Everything was different.

49:06.612 --> 49:09.215
I couldn't make hide nor hair of it.

49:09.248 --> 49:11.450
They... they disappeared.

49:11.483 --> 49:13.319
Uh, everything changed.

49:13.352 --> 49:14.653
I changed.

49:50.922 --> 49:53.725
I have not really photographed
wolves since then.

49:53.759 --> 49:55.661
It broke my heart.

49:55.694 --> 49:57.696
It really destroyed me, in some sense.

49:57.729 --> 49:59.798
I've not been the same.

49:59.831 --> 50:02.968
It... it broke... it drove me to tears.

50:18.950 --> 50:21.787
Stop the hunt!

50:21.820 --> 50:24.690
Stop the hunt!

50:24.723 --> 50:27.359
Stop the hunt!

50:27.393 --> 50:29.961
Stop the hunt!

50:29.995 --> 50:33.699
Stop the hunt!

50:33.732 --> 50:36.868
We know in Minnesota the one
survey that was conducted

50:36.902 --> 50:38.637
by the department of natural resources

50:38.670 --> 50:40.439
before the hunt began.

50:40.472 --> 50:44.009
In that single survey,
79% of the respondents

50:44.042 --> 50:46.812
opposed the season, yet
they went ahead with it.

50:46.845 --> 50:49.881
Stop the hunt!

51:48.707 --> 51:51.510
Minnesota is special.

51:51.543 --> 51:55.747
We are special here because
we have always had wolves.

51:55.781 --> 51:57.949
When they were down in 1970,

51:57.983 --> 52:00.085
the endangered threatened species act,

52:00.118 --> 52:02.521
in my opinion, was written
with the wolf in mind.

52:02.554 --> 52:04.590
And we were the only state that had 'em,

52:04.623 --> 52:07.859
and the reason we had 'em, wasn't
'cause of anything we've done,

52:07.893 --> 52:10.496
it was because we had wild lands

52:10.529 --> 52:12.364
where they could find refuge.

52:12.398 --> 52:14.500
You know who I feel like
I'm fighting to protect

52:14.533 --> 52:16.635
the environment from?
The DNR!

52:20.071 --> 52:22.441
Hello, this is Jane Goodall.

52:22.474 --> 52:24.776
I really wish I could be in Minnesota

52:24.810 --> 52:28.947
to greet you in person,
but I am thinking of you.

52:28.980 --> 52:31.850
There you are, gathered
to make your views known

52:31.883 --> 52:34.886
to those who have the power
of making decisions.

52:34.920 --> 52:37.389
They're absolutely neat, your wolves.

52:37.423 --> 52:41.059
The only population
in the lower 48 states

52:41.092 --> 52:43.462
that wasn't exterminated.

52:43.495 --> 52:46.498
I personally have
a real love for wolves.

52:46.532 --> 52:49.901
They show all the characteristics
of loyalty and courage

52:49.935 --> 52:52.904
that we admire in our own domestic dogs.

52:52.938 --> 52:56.675
They have similar emotions,
such as contentment and fear.

52:56.708 --> 52:58.910
They know suffering and pain.

52:58.944 --> 53:01.747
It's time that recreational
hunting of wolves

53:01.780 --> 53:05.451
and other forms of
persecution came to an end.

53:05.484 --> 53:07.052
And you, in Minnesota,

53:07.085 --> 53:10.121
by insisting on a just
wolf-management plan,

53:10.155 --> 53:11.657
can lead the way.

53:32.578 --> 53:34.613
I would not kill a wolf.

53:34.646 --> 53:37.683
I know that, because
he's here for a reason,

53:37.716 --> 53:39.451
just like I am.

53:39.485 --> 53:42.053
We all are here for a reason.

53:42.087 --> 53:44.690
But we need to acknowledge that.

53:44.723 --> 53:46.524
And then we went to
the fond de lac reservation

53:46.525 --> 53:49.961
and we had a ceremony honoring the wolf.

53:49.995 --> 53:51.963
Um, it... actually,

53:51.997 --> 53:54.099
that was extremely moving.

53:54.132 --> 53:56.635
Um, it was sad to me, because the...

53:56.668 --> 53:58.670
the Ojibwe culture
really values the wolf,

53:58.704 --> 54:00.639
and the people there, um...

54:00.672 --> 54:02.941
they were talking about how
the wolf would hide in caves,

54:02.974 --> 54:05.744
the wolf would escape. They were...
they were trying to think

54:05.777 --> 54:07.512
of any way that they could
cope with the fact

54:07.513 --> 54:09.047
that these wolves were gonna be killed.

54:09.080 --> 54:11.983
By the time we drove back
to the twin cities that day,

54:12.017 --> 54:13.685
November 3rd, 2012,

54:13.719 --> 54:16.488
we'd already had seven wolves killed.

54:23.762 --> 54:26.231
I think it was Edward Abby
said something about

54:26.264 --> 54:27.999
if we destroy the last
of the wilderness,

54:28.033 --> 54:29.701
I mean, we destroy the very,

54:29.735 --> 54:31.202
we're threatening the very idea

54:31.236 --> 54:33.104
of freedom itself.

54:33.138 --> 54:34.806
It's what makes us a people.

54:34.840 --> 54:37.609
It's not just some
abstract thing out there

54:37.643 --> 54:39.611
for recreation to go visit in a canoe,

54:39.645 --> 54:41.547
or backpacking or something,

54:41.580 --> 54:42.848
it's what we are as a people.

54:42.881 --> 54:44.282
And we need to hang on to it,

54:44.315 --> 54:46.885
we've got to fight corporations.

54:46.918 --> 54:49.655
We've got to fight this
recreation industrial complex

54:49.688 --> 54:53.291
that's threatening these precious
wild lands that are so diverse.

54:53.324 --> 54:58.697
The foundation that... that
supports our being here today

54:58.730 --> 55:00.766
is all the micro-organisms in the soil

55:00.799 --> 55:03.301
and the plants and the
animals that walk on it,

55:03.334 --> 55:05.771
the animals that swim
and the animals that fly.

55:05.804 --> 55:08.640
We're all intertwined,
it's that great web of life.

55:08.674 --> 55:10.909
In Mahingan, the wolf, he's our brother,

55:10.942 --> 55:12.077
he's right there with us.

55:12.110 --> 55:14.946
We walk the earth with him.

55:14.980 --> 55:17.215
I found that there are
many indigenous cultures

55:17.248 --> 55:21.152
in the world that have
always revered the wolf.

55:21.186 --> 55:24.289
I interviewed chi-Mahingan,
which means "big wolf"

55:24.322 --> 55:26.224
from the red lake nation.

55:26.257 --> 55:28.026
For the Ojibwe people,

55:28.059 --> 55:30.829
there's no separation
between the wolf and them.

55:30.862 --> 55:35.601
The wolf holds the medicine
and teaches humility.

55:35.634 --> 55:37.903
You know, one of the first
designs that was created

55:37.936 --> 55:40.606
was a circle.

55:40.639 --> 55:43.241
And everything after that
was placed inside the circle.

55:45.376 --> 55:49.047
And therefore, everything
moves in the circle.

55:53.151 --> 55:57.055
Even the human,
from childhood to childhood,

55:57.088 --> 55:59.057
the seasons go in circle.

56:01.226 --> 56:04.830
All the stars, the sun,
the moon, the earth,

56:04.863 --> 56:06.598
it always moves in a circle.

56:10.902 --> 56:14.205
And what that creates
is what they call a rhythm.

56:14.239 --> 56:16.574
There's a universal rhythm.

56:19.845 --> 56:22.981
And I... and I kinda joke
about that, too, you know,

56:23.014 --> 56:24.650
saying everything tries to be round,

56:24.683 --> 56:27.052
they say everything a Indian
does tries to be round.

56:27.085 --> 56:28.954
I try to be round.

56:30.656 --> 56:32.624
They are, traditionally
Indians are round.

56:32.658 --> 56:33.625
You have continuity.

56:35.193 --> 56:38.129
Today they told the animals

56:38.163 --> 56:40.165
to take care of their brother,

56:40.198 --> 56:42.400
the human being.

56:42.433 --> 56:43.802
Otherwise,

56:43.835 --> 56:47.973
the human being would not have survived.

56:49.975 --> 56:55.413
The animal people, yes,
we will watch our brother.

56:55.446 --> 56:59.350
We will give them our hide,
we will give them our flesh.

56:59.384 --> 57:01.920
We'll give them our bones
so they can live.

57:04.055 --> 57:06.892
So we know that, said the animal people.

57:08.960 --> 57:12.998
And today we're gonna pay
the animal people,

57:13.031 --> 57:15.166
especially the wolf,
we're gonna pay him back

57:15.200 --> 57:17.335
by killing him.

57:18.804 --> 57:20.438
Medicine,

57:20.471 --> 57:22.808
when I think of...

57:25.744 --> 57:27.946
The role it has in bringing us back

57:27.979 --> 57:31.783
to our own center of integrity,

57:31.817 --> 57:33.752
which means wholeness, basically.

57:33.785 --> 57:35.721
Where our own regenerative health powers

57:35.754 --> 57:38.389
can find their balance again.

57:38.423 --> 57:42.728
In that sense, medicine is a catalyst.

57:42.761 --> 57:45.163
And I see the wolf,

57:47.966 --> 57:50.769
in a sense, one can say
the wolf is medicine.

57:54.039 --> 57:55.941
But then that raises,
for me, another question,

57:55.974 --> 57:58.209
which is, well what are we ailing from?

57:58.243 --> 58:00.011
What is the ailment?

58:00.045 --> 58:02.247
And I think when one
looks around the lands,

58:02.280 --> 58:04.082
across the world, there is one,

58:04.115 --> 58:05.951
in this time we live in,

58:05.984 --> 58:07.452
the ailment that we...

58:07.485 --> 58:11.022
we struggle with, is fear.

58:11.056 --> 58:14.192
It is fear of the enemy. It is fear of
the neighbor. It is fear of the self.

58:14.225 --> 58:15.861
It is fear of power.
It is fear of love.

58:15.894 --> 58:17.763
It is fear of so many things.

58:17.796 --> 58:20.331
Fear of the loss of livelihood,

58:20.365 --> 58:23.735
in the case of those living
directly with wolves,

58:23.769 --> 58:25.135
and all these fear elements, for me,

58:25.136 --> 58:28.506
are directly embodied by the wolf.

58:28.539 --> 58:31.042
The wolf is a great mirror towards us.

58:31.076 --> 58:32.443
We have so many similarities,

58:32.477 --> 58:35.881
and as you talk about
in that Ojibwe myth,

58:37.949 --> 58:40.318
the wolf is, in a sense, our partner,

58:40.351 --> 58:43.521
and our brother, and was in the past.

58:43.554 --> 58:46.024
And I think going forward, there is,

58:46.057 --> 58:49.127
if one looks at the wolf
as a medicine in that sense,

58:49.160 --> 58:51.429
there's really much that we can learn,

58:51.462 --> 58:53.464
in our current society, from the wolf.

58:57.302 --> 58:58.870
Inspired by the idea

58:58.904 --> 59:02.007
of the wolf as a symbol of medicine,

59:02.040 --> 59:03.975
I decided to go to California

59:04.009 --> 59:06.211
and spend time with the group
that is doing something

59:06.244 --> 59:11.349
very unique with wolves,
wolf-dogs and people.

59:15.854 --> 59:17.388
That was nice.

59:19.958 --> 59:23.094
Thank you, wow, I feel special.

59:23.128 --> 59:26.431
A wolf rehabilitation center
in Acton, California

59:26.464 --> 59:29.567
that believes strongly
that the wolf has great value

59:29.600 --> 59:32.503
and is a teacher that we can learn from.

59:33.604 --> 59:35.874
And we're at a wolf hike they do.

59:35.907 --> 59:39.510
Each month, they'll take people
to see their wolves and wolf-dogs

59:39.544 --> 59:41.546
and teach them about wolves.

59:41.579 --> 59:44.883
They rehabilitate these animals,

59:44.916 --> 59:47.819
and then they work with people
and inner-city youths,

59:47.853 --> 59:52.457
and people with PTSD, it's quite
extraordinary what they do.

59:52.490 --> 59:55.360
We have the kids come in, they're
coming from all different backgrounds,

59:55.393 --> 59:57.863
most of them are at-risk youth

59:57.896 --> 01:00:00.031
coming from inner-city situations.

01:00:00.065 --> 01:00:02.500
They've come from gang violence

01:00:02.533 --> 01:00:06.604
and that kind of a thing, and
they come in with their walls up,

01:00:06.637 --> 01:00:09.140
always needing to protect
themselves, make sure they're safe,

01:00:09.174 --> 01:00:11.541
they come in, they've got their
attitude, they've got their swagger

01:00:11.542 --> 01:00:13.344
goin' on, and you know,
they're like comin' in

01:00:13.378 --> 01:00:16.181
and they're like, "whatever,
what do you got to teach me?"

01:00:16.214 --> 01:00:18.149
And they come in,
they got their, you know,

01:00:18.183 --> 01:00:19.450
earphones in and stuff, we go,

01:00:19.484 --> 01:00:21.386
"take your earphones out," you know,

01:00:21.419 --> 01:00:23.254
"hand 'em over,"

01:00:23.288 --> 01:00:25.556
"you're gonna stand here,
you're gonna sit here

01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:28.059
and we're gonna make a circle."

01:00:28.093 --> 01:00:30.495
"And we're just gonna
get really present."

01:00:30.528 --> 01:00:33.965
"And the minute that
they all truly drop in,

01:00:33.999 --> 01:00:37.002
and let go of that stuff
and center themselves,

01:00:37.035 --> 01:00:40.105
the pack will actually begin to howl."

01:00:49.214 --> 01:00:51.282
And this has happened numerous times,

01:00:51.316 --> 01:00:56.054
and every single time the kids go...

01:00:56.087 --> 01:00:58.256
"Oh my God!"

01:00:58.289 --> 01:00:59.423
And for the rest of the program

01:00:59.424 --> 01:01:00.992
they're putty in our hands,

01:01:01.026 --> 01:01:02.227
it's incredible.

01:01:10.235 --> 01:01:13.304
Oh, what a vicious wolf,

01:01:15.106 --> 01:01:16.374
yes you are.

01:01:18.243 --> 01:01:19.544
Yes you are.

01:01:19.577 --> 01:01:22.047
You're a big vicious wolf.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:25.116
Yes.

01:01:27.318 --> 01:01:29.520
And inevitably, they'll pick one or two

01:01:29.554 --> 01:01:32.357
particular wolves that they really feel

01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:34.625
a connection with because of the story.

01:01:34.659 --> 01:01:36.995
Then when they finally
get to meet that wolf,

01:01:37.028 --> 01:01:38.629
and they get to sit with that wolf,

01:01:38.663 --> 01:01:42.600
and they get to look into
the eyes of that wolf,

01:01:42.633 --> 01:01:45.570
looking into the eyes of a wolf

01:01:45.603 --> 01:01:50.341
it's like you're really
seeing your own soul.

01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:52.610
And that is incredibly healing.

01:01:52.643 --> 01:01:55.146
You take a look at this, its posture,

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.516
and how big it is, and you would
automatically be scared of it,

01:01:58.549 --> 01:02:01.552
but in reality it's just...
just a loving creature,

01:02:01.586 --> 01:02:06.624
it just... it just wants to be loved
like anybody and anything else,

01:02:06.657 --> 01:02:08.059
it just wants to be loved.

01:02:08.093 --> 01:02:09.427
It wants to be...

01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:12.163
The de-listing of wolves.

01:02:13.698 --> 01:02:17.135
You just have to... you
just have to really just...

01:02:23.374 --> 01:02:25.243
You just really just...

01:02:26.611 --> 01:02:28.346
have to really...

01:02:28.379 --> 01:02:29.714
if you really wanna help...

01:02:34.285 --> 01:02:36.654
That's love right there.

01:03:22.333 --> 01:03:24.169
Get my psychiatrist.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:32.610
This is where I come, specifically,

01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:35.646
besides the walking, is quite nice,

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.049
where things do feel better.

01:03:38.083 --> 01:03:41.186
When I think about
crisis-es in the world,

01:03:41.219 --> 01:03:43.288
crisis-es happening around me,

01:03:43.321 --> 01:03:45.223
especially with the wolves,

01:03:45.256 --> 01:03:46.391
I feel better here.

01:03:46.424 --> 01:03:49.194
And it helps me.

01:03:49.227 --> 01:03:50.761
It's a time of re-evaluation.

01:03:50.795 --> 01:03:52.797
That's what the wolves taught me.

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:55.166
In an odd way, right?

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.701
In a very odd way,

01:03:56.734 --> 01:04:00.105
this whole wolf hunt
has made me confront things

01:04:00.138 --> 01:04:01.806
that I don't have answers for.

01:04:01.839 --> 01:04:03.608
My investment and telling the story,

01:04:03.641 --> 01:04:05.776
and seeing it was maybe wasted.

01:04:05.810 --> 01:04:09.414
There's a lesson there,
I have to get beyond that.

01:04:09.447 --> 01:04:11.282
I have to think about that a little bit,

01:04:11.316 --> 01:04:12.683
I'm pretty angry.

01:04:12.717 --> 01:04:14.385
Anger is not a solution,

01:04:14.419 --> 01:04:16.621
and something you shouldn't
carry around with you.

01:04:16.654 --> 01:04:18.523
I've been gone a lot because of that,

01:04:18.556 --> 01:04:22.093
choose to, certainly
during the hunting season.

01:04:22.127 --> 01:04:24.695
The pups are born,
there was a den nearby,

01:04:24.729 --> 01:04:28.399
there were pups born, they're out there.

01:04:28.433 --> 01:04:32.303
Uh, I'll think,
well, like the first hunt,

01:04:32.337 --> 01:04:35.373
the last wolf
I photographed was blondie.

01:04:35.406 --> 01:04:38.209
That was a wolf that was
shot, and she was a pup.

01:04:38.243 --> 01:04:40.545
She was nine months old.

01:04:40.578 --> 01:04:42.347
I'm afraid to bond to these animals.

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:43.881
I've bonded to every, I knew,

01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:46.484
I've probably known 30, or 40 wolves

01:04:46.517 --> 01:04:49.820
like friends, over the years,

01:04:49.854 --> 01:04:51.489
and I'm afraid to do that now.

01:04:51.522 --> 01:04:52.690
It's been a couple years now

01:04:52.723 --> 01:04:55.092
and it's not getting any better.

01:04:56.527 --> 01:04:58.429
No.

01:05:07.705 --> 01:05:09.607
I came back to Minnesota

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.776
for one last interview with Jim

01:05:11.809 --> 01:05:15.780
before I was to wrap up the film.

01:05:15.813 --> 01:05:17.582
But with another wolf hunt
on the horizon,

01:05:17.615 --> 01:05:20.751
it was a bit of a somber reunion.

01:05:20.785 --> 01:05:23.221
But just as we were about to pack up,

01:05:23.254 --> 01:05:26.924
Jim, with his unique ability
for resilience,

01:05:26.957 --> 01:05:29.927
said he had something
he wanted to show us.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:32.163
Something he had just found

01:05:32.197 --> 01:05:33.831
that he hadn't
shared with anyone before.

01:05:35.833 --> 01:05:38.403
And I wondered in that moment

01:05:38.436 --> 01:05:41.339
if Jim, too, was looking for some hope.

01:05:48.379 --> 01:05:50.848
I can't explain it,
it happens to me a lot.

01:05:50.881 --> 01:05:52.950
I don't know what it is.

01:05:52.983 --> 01:05:55.720
It isn't psychic, it's something else.

01:05:55.753 --> 01:05:57.955
Just curiosity, because I'm so curious,

01:05:57.988 --> 01:06:00.558
I eventually ran into
something interesting.

01:06:00.591 --> 01:06:03.461
I don't think this den
necessarily pulled me

01:06:03.494 --> 01:06:07.298
psychically, like "come see us, Jim,"

01:06:07.332 --> 01:06:08.899
but it almost feels like that because

01:06:08.933 --> 01:06:10.668
it's happened to me enough times,

01:06:10.701 --> 01:06:12.537
and especially here.

01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:14.439
So just up around the corner,

01:06:14.472 --> 01:06:16.741
I looked down and I saw the
grass was all matted down,

01:06:16.774 --> 01:06:18.375
I thought, someone
came here for a picnic.

01:06:18.376 --> 01:06:20.345
Except nobody comes here.

01:06:20.378 --> 01:06:22.547
It was very unnatural looking,

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.349
so I just took... followed the trail up

01:06:24.382 --> 01:06:27.818
and looked a little bit further,

01:06:27.852 --> 01:06:32.223
and saw chewings on the tree.

01:06:32.257 --> 01:06:34.325
I thought beaver?
No.

01:06:34.359 --> 01:06:36.527
Den.

01:06:36.561 --> 01:06:38.263
Wolf den?
Too fantastic.

01:06:38.296 --> 01:06:41.232
Maybe fox or coyote.

01:06:41.266 --> 01:06:42.967
Came up,

01:06:44.535 --> 01:06:47.238
saw this,

01:06:49.006 --> 01:06:51.476
virtually the minute I saw this den

01:06:51.509 --> 01:06:55.380
within the minute, almost 15 seconds,

01:06:55.413 --> 01:06:59.450
I was standing on a very
supple twig, branch,

01:06:59.484 --> 01:07:02.753
it let loose as I started
walking toward the entrance,

01:07:02.787 --> 01:07:06.624
just to look, I mean, I was 30, 40 feet.

01:07:06.657 --> 01:07:09.660
Snapped me in the eye and it felt
like a hammer hit me on the head.

01:07:09.694 --> 01:07:12.697
So you've got the mixture of exaltation

01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:15.566
of seeing a wolf den,

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.835
the same time
getting spanked in the eye.

01:07:17.868 --> 01:07:19.404
Just about knocked me out,

01:07:19.437 --> 01:07:23.007
I knew I had a pretty
serious eye injury,

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.010
and it just came to me, you're
not supposed to be here.

01:07:26.043 --> 01:07:28.646
I wouldn't have stayed here anyway,

01:07:28.679 --> 01:07:30.615
'cause you can't be around wolf dens

01:07:30.648 --> 01:07:31.982
without them possibly moving,

01:07:32.016 --> 01:07:35.420
and I wanted to get out of here quick.

01:07:35.453 --> 01:07:39.424
But the eye being injured by this twig

01:07:39.457 --> 01:07:41.526
was too much to comprehend.

01:07:41.559 --> 01:07:43.361
And I didn't know what to think,

01:07:43.394 --> 01:07:45.363
except, is this another message?

01:07:45.396 --> 01:07:48.032
Is this, come look at,
come, here's the den,

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:49.634
but don't come in.

01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:08.586
As an investigative reporter as
I am, you wanna get the story,

01:08:08.619 --> 01:08:10.888
you wanna tell every bit of the story,

01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:12.657
but I'd done that in the arctic,

01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:14.425
crawled into the den in the arctic,

01:08:14.459 --> 01:08:16.761
and the wolves stayed there
the whole summer.

01:08:16.794 --> 01:08:18.863
They didn't move the den,
they didn't leave.

01:08:18.895 --> 01:08:20.129
But they were like family to me,

01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:21.765
they trusted me.

01:08:21.799 --> 01:08:23.533
These wolves don't trust me.

01:08:23.568 --> 01:08:25.336
I haven't seen them with my eyes.

01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:27.404
I've not seen the mother or father,

01:08:27.438 --> 01:08:28.939
I don't know who these wolves are.

01:08:28.973 --> 01:08:30.575
I've seen them on the trail cam,

01:08:30.608 --> 01:08:32.041
but I've never seen them with my eye,

01:08:32.042 --> 01:08:33.778
haven't heard them howl.

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:37.782
So it's haunting,
it's nearly haunting to me.

01:08:37.814 --> 01:08:41.419
So it's like finding

01:08:41.452 --> 01:08:43.520
a treasure under your bed

01:08:43.554 --> 01:08:45.523
that was always there,

01:08:45.555 --> 01:08:47.692
I'm trying to think of another analogy,

01:08:47.725 --> 01:08:51.529
in your cupboard,
you find a stack of gold,

01:08:51.562 --> 01:08:55.399
or a Rembrandt painting.

01:08:55.433 --> 01:08:57.368
And I didn't know what to do with it,

01:08:57.402 --> 01:08:59.002
except just get out of there quickly.

01:08:59.036 --> 01:09:02.038
'Cause I know if I stayed,
they'd move the pups.

01:09:04.809 --> 01:09:06.076
Did you hear that?

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:15.685
What I've learned in life,
I'm almost 70 years old now,

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.121
and I've learned that you really have
to come in through the back door

01:09:18.122 --> 01:09:19.724
to change people's attitudes.

01:09:19.756 --> 01:09:21.892
You can't confront it head on,

01:09:21.926 --> 01:09:23.828
and convince someone to stop drinking,

01:09:23.861 --> 01:09:26.764
stop smoking, stop speeding,

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:28.966
stop killing wolves.

01:09:28.999 --> 01:09:31.736
You... have to somehow
come in the back door.

01:09:31.769 --> 01:09:33.738
When I met you,

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:36.674
you're the only person I've worked with.

01:09:36.707 --> 01:09:38.108
Uh, why?

01:09:38.142 --> 01:09:40.645
I don't... I just had
an intuition that you,

01:09:40.678 --> 01:09:44.982
and your message, and your
movie could make a difference.

01:09:45.015 --> 01:09:47.518
So find that back door. I don't
know what that back door is.

01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:50.054
That's what I thought I've
been doing my whole life.

01:09:50.087 --> 01:09:51.788
I'm not sure.

01:09:51.822 --> 01:09:55.025
I get a lot of beautiful letters.

01:09:55.059 --> 01:09:56.927
I don't know.

01:09:56.961 --> 01:09:59.564
It's easy to be discouraged.

01:09:59.597 --> 01:10:02.667
But I have to think that there's hope...
here's hope.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.736
We'll see, we'll see.

01:10:13.744 --> 01:10:17.114
Then, the news came.

01:10:17.147 --> 01:10:20.885
On December 21st, 2014,

01:10:20.918 --> 01:10:24.589
a federal judge threw out the
Obama administration decision

01:10:24.622 --> 01:10:28.459
to remove the grey wolf population
in the Great Lakes region

01:10:28.493 --> 01:10:30.628
from the endangered species list.

01:10:30.661 --> 01:10:33.731
A decision that would ban further
wolf hunting and trapping

01:10:33.764 --> 01:10:39.770
in the three states, Wisconsin,
Michigan, and Minnesota.

01:10:39.804 --> 01:10:41.939
U.S. district judge, Beryl Howell

01:10:41.972 --> 01:10:45.643
ruled the removal was
arbitrary and capricious,

01:10:45.676 --> 01:10:49.580
and violated the federal
endangered species act.

01:10:49.614 --> 01:10:51.616
She concludes,

01:10:51.649 --> 01:10:54.652
"at times a court must lean
forward from the bench

01:10:54.685 --> 01:10:56.587
"to let an agency know,

01:10:56.621 --> 01:11:01.191
"in no uncertain terms,
that enough is enough.

01:11:01.225 --> 01:11:04.495
And this, is one of those times."
