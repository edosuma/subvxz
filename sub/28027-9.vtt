LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

00:25.090 --> 00:27.090
SEASON VI
EPISODE 9

00:30.150 --> 00:33.130
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

00:33.180 --> 00:36.140
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

00:36.200 --> 00:40.090
We begin with
the major news of the week,

00:40.110 --> 00:43.070
the release
of one man's painstaking work

00:43.110 --> 00:45.130
and the impact
it may have on history.

00:54.100 --> 00:58.000
It's Queen Elizabeth's
93rd birthday today

00:58.030 --> 00:59.200
and that guy nailed it.

01:00.220 --> 01:03.050
There was one other
major story this week,

01:03.070 --> 01:07.090
concerning the latest installment
in the "Stupid Watergate".

01:07.110 --> 01:10.210
Watergate, if Nixon had been
kicked in the head by a billy goat

01:10.230 --> 01:14.070
and if that billy goat had been
the White House chief of staff.

01:14.160 --> 01:18.120
On Thursday, the Mueller report
was finally released.

01:18.160 --> 01:21.140
It was over 400 pages long
and many in the media chose

01:21.160 --> 01:24.090
to make a feature
of processing it in plain sight.

01:24.110 --> 01:27.190
MSNBC had Ari Melber reading it
in the corner of the studio,

01:27.210 --> 01:30.230
as if relegated to the kid's table,
while New York 1 aired

01:31.030 --> 01:35.020
30 seconds of their printer getting
ready to print the report out.

01:35.150 --> 01:40.110
Once the report had been read it
became clear there was a lot in it.

01:40.230 --> 01:44.140
Mueller confirmed that Russia
interfered in our election,

01:44.210 --> 01:49.120
but did not conclude that the Trump
team engaged in a criminal conspiracy.

01:49.140 --> 01:52.200
Several actions by the president
were investigated

01:52.220 --> 01:55.080
as potentially
obstruction of justice.

01:55.120 --> 01:59.000
Mueller's team says: "If we had
confidence that the President"

01:59.020 --> 02:02.150
"did not commit obstruction of justice,
we would so state."

02:02.740 --> 02:06.720
Last one is a conspicuous
non-exoneration.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.810
If you were interviewing a job
applicant and they told you:

02:09.840 --> 02:13.690
"I wasn't found guilty
of fucking my neighbors' mailboxes,"

02:13.710 --> 02:16.730
"but I also
wasn't found innocent."

02:17.650 --> 02:19.800
You would not necessarily
rule them out,

02:19.820 --> 02:22.640
but you'd think twice
about hiring them.

02:22.670 --> 02:25.760
Some of the details
in this report were incredible.

02:26.660 --> 02:29.650
When Trump learned that
Robert Mueller was appointed,

02:29.680 --> 02:31.710
he slumped back in his chair
and said:

02:31.730 --> 02:35.740
"This is terrible. This is the end
of my presidency. I'm f'...d.'"

02:36.700 --> 02:39.610
Fucked.
He said: "I'm fucked."

02:39.690 --> 02:42.840
While we don't know whether
Trump will face repercussions,

02:43.610 --> 02:46.820
I'd like to live a little longer
in the moment of him saying:

02:46.840 --> 02:49.840
"This is the end of my
presidency, I'm fucked."

02:50.630 --> 02:53.750
I'll take artistic license
to fully paint that scene for you:

02:53.780 --> 02:57.720
Trump, upon learning Mueller
was appointed, slumping in his chair,

02:57.740 --> 03:03.680
Ivanka playing fetch with Don Jr.,
Eric's tongue is stuck to a flagpole,

03:03.950 --> 03:07.030
Priebus is walking around with
his head inside a honey pot,

03:07.090 --> 03:10.150
Jared is standing
in front of a blank wall,

03:10.980 --> 03:13.940
Bannon is stress-eating
a bowl of used syringes

03:13.960 --> 03:16.980
and Stephen Miller
is pulling the legs off a spider,

03:17.010 --> 03:21.010
while Trump says those words,
as tears roll down:

03:21.040 --> 03:23.960
"This is the end of my presidency.
I'm fucked."

03:24.020 --> 03:28.110
At that moment, a pigeon flies
in and shits in his mouth.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.060
It is a masterpiece.

03:33.150 --> 03:35.920
I'm not saying
that's what happened,

03:35.950 --> 03:38.060
we don't definitively know
that it didn't.

03:38.130 --> 03:42.130
We can't cover everything
in the report tonight.

03:42.150 --> 03:45.000
I'd like to concentrate
on two key factors

03:45.020 --> 03:46.990
that may've saved the president:

03:47.010 --> 03:50.000
incompetence when it comes
to conspiracy with Russia

03:50.030 --> 03:53.090
and disobedience when it
comes to obstruction of justice.

03:53.110 --> 03:56.970
Let's start with incompetence.
Meaning, with Michael Cohen.

03:56.990 --> 04:01.050
The report spells out that Cohen
was in contact with Russians,

04:01.070 --> 04:04.930
mostly concerning Trump's efforts
to build a tower in Moscow.

04:04.980 --> 04:08.150
Which, in and of itself
is wildly inappropriate.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.070
It is compromising for a candidate

04:11.120 --> 04:15.080
to be asking business favors
of a hostile foreign government.

04:15.120 --> 04:18.200
But from the very beginning,
Cohen was laughably inept.

04:18.980 --> 04:22.050
He reached out to Putin's press
spokesman, Dmitry Peskov,

04:22.070 --> 04:23.960
but couldn't get through.

04:23.980 --> 04:28.110
That's because he meant to e-mail
"PR-peskova-at-prpress-dot-gov."

04:28.130 --> 04:33.100
But actually e-mailed "dot-gof"
instead. And "dot-gof",

04:33.120 --> 04:37.100
sends you right to the server for the
new HBO series "Game of Flounder",

04:37.120 --> 04:42.030
where powerful flounder families
fight for control of the 7 sandbars.

04:42.060 --> 04:45.170
It starts in June.
This network is fucked.

04:46.200 --> 04:52.050
Another case of Cohen bungling
contact with Russians involved

04:52.070 --> 04:56.080
Dmitry Klokov, a former press
secretary to Russia's energy minister.

04:56.100 --> 05:01.080
Klokov's ex-wife contacted Ivanka,
offering assistance to the campaign.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.140
That is someone with ties
to the Russian government,

05:04.170 --> 05:06.170
offering help to elect Trump.

05:06.840 --> 05:10.920
Ivanka forwarded that e-mail to Cohen,
who Googled "Dmitry Klokov"

05:10.940 --> 05:15.010
and concluded they must be talking
about a former Olympic weightlifter,

05:15.030 --> 05:18.040
a man who has
videos online like this.

05:27.910 --> 05:32.910
Cohen saw that and thought:
"I got the right Dmitry Klokov."

05:33.860 --> 05:37.880
Apparently, Russia's energy minister's
press secretary is jacked!

05:37.920 --> 05:40.800
And good for you, bra,
hustle for that muscle.

05:40.820 --> 05:43.830
Sore today, strong tomorrow.
Get swole, feed the soul.

05:43.850 --> 05:45.940
From one beef tower
to another: respect.

05:47.930 --> 05:54.030
The real Klokov kept trying to set
up a meeting between Trump and Putin,

05:54.810 --> 05:57.920
but Cohen blew that proposal off,
which may not be surprising,

05:57.950 --> 06:04.040
given that Cohen still appeared to
believe that the Klokov he spoke with

06:04.810 --> 06:06.010
was the Olympic weightlifter.

06:06.930 --> 06:09.910
Of course he was confused,
he was trying to figure out

06:09.930 --> 06:12.930
why deceased German ice hockey
goalie Robert Mueller

06:12.950 --> 06:14.870
wanted to speak with him.

06:15.810 --> 06:19.830
It wasn't just Cohen.
The report found multiple instances

06:19.850 --> 06:23.830
where people tied to the Russian
government offered Trump assistance

06:23.850 --> 06:26.830
and, in some instances,
the Campaign was receptive.

06:26.850 --> 06:29.850
But the thing that seemed
to stop closer coordination

06:29.870 --> 06:33.800
was cartoonish levels of
disorganization and incompetence.

06:33.860 --> 06:38.910
There were times when the Trump
team's ignorance of basic concepts

06:38.940 --> 06:42.850
seems to have helped shield them
from criminal liability,

06:42.890 --> 06:46.000
most notably when it came to
the infamous Trump Tower meeting,

06:46.020 --> 06:50.040
featuring Don Jr., Jared, Paul Manafort
and a Russian offering more dirt.

06:50.810 --> 06:54.970
Mueller's team concluded it would
unlikely be able to prove beyond doubt

06:55.010 --> 06:59.910
that the participants had knowledge
their conduct was unlawful.

07:00.850 --> 07:04.800
That kind of makes sense!
It is gonna be hard to prove

07:04.830 --> 07:08.800
that this guy had knowledge that his
conduct could be breaking the law

07:08.830 --> 07:11.810
or that he had knowledge
of anything at all,

07:11.850 --> 07:15.020
other than what it feels like
to watch flags get more hugs

07:15.040 --> 07:18.840
from your dad than you'd get
if you lived to be a thousand.

07:18.860 --> 07:20.900
When it comes to conspiracy,

07:21.850 --> 07:25.870
despite Russians wanting to help,

07:25.900 --> 07:28.870
everyone around him was too
inept to work with them.

07:28.900 --> 07:32.020
So, as for the other major question,
obstruction of justice,

07:32.820 --> 07:34.880
Trump's saving grace
may've been that,

07:34.900 --> 07:37.860
despite ample evidence
that he tried to do it,

07:37.890 --> 07:40.860
everyone around him
was too disobedient to listen.

07:41.020 --> 07:44.900
The report paints a remarkable
portrait of the president as a man

07:44.920 --> 07:47.000
obsessed with
the Russia investigation,

07:47.020 --> 07:50.990
trying to seize control of the inquiry
through his White House aides.

07:51.010 --> 07:54.980
It highlights at least ten current
and former officials or associates

07:55.000 --> 07:56.960
who did not carry out his orders.

07:57.900 --> 08:01.970
The news that the president ordered
subordinates to do things

08:01.990 --> 08:05.910
that might constitute obstruction
and then they just ignored him,

08:05.930 --> 08:08.810
is both reassuring
and also terrifying.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.960
That's like your spouse saying:

08:10.980 --> 08:13.930
"Don't worry about the snake,
the baby killed it."

08:13.950 --> 08:17.070
I'm glad the snake is dead,

08:17.840 --> 08:20.020
but that means there was
a fucking snake in there.

08:20.060 --> 08:23.070
And it also means our baby
has snake killing strength.

08:23.910 --> 08:27.030
There's a lot to process here.
I'm happy, I'm relieved,

08:27.050 --> 08:30.880
but I'm also angry
and confused.

08:31.920 --> 08:35.870
Multiple instances of people
ignoring president's instructions.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.919
When Trump asked Corey Lewandowski
to send his attorney general a message.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.970
The president gave him orders
to tell the attorney general, Sessions,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.960
to curtail the scope
of the Russia investigation.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.010
Lewandowski
never followed through on it,

08:50.030 --> 08:55.850
pass it to another aide who did also
not follow through on that.

08:56.030 --> 08:59.850
That's a chain of two people
failing to follow through

08:59.870 --> 09:01.080
on a demand
from the president.

09:01.870 --> 09:04.980
That aide then passed
Trump's order off to an assistant,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.020
who opened the window and
shouted it to a groundskeeper,

09:08.050 --> 09:11.870
who wrote it down and taped it
to a Roomba that was passing by,

09:11.980 --> 09:13.980
which drove itself
into the river,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.150
because this isn't why
it got into government.

09:16.170 --> 09:19.980
The most shocking example
of the president being ignored

09:20.000 --> 09:22.180
involved former White House
Counsel Don McGahn.

09:22.200 --> 09:26.970
Trump called and directed him to have
Mueller removed as special counsel.

09:26.990 --> 09:31.120
McGahn refused, but Trump kept
pushing, until this happened.

09:31.980 --> 09:35.970
Instead of carrying out Trump's
request, McGahn decided he would quit.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.180
He called his lawyer, drove to
the White House, packed up his office,

09:39.200 --> 09:43.090
prepared to submit a resignation
letter with his chief of staff,

09:43.110 --> 09:47.130
told Reince Priebus that the president
has asked him to 'do crazy blank.'

09:47.150 --> 09:50.120
Informed Priebus
and Bannon that he was leaving.

09:51.020 --> 09:52.990
Holy fucking blank.

09:53.990 --> 09:58.010
Preparing to quit because you're being
asked to do "crazy shit"

09:58.030 --> 10:01.000
isn't what you expect
from the White House Counsel,

10:01.030 --> 10:04.150
it's what you expect from
Nicolas Cage's personal assistant.

10:04.170 --> 10:08.050
No, Nicolas, I'm not constructing
a ten-foot voodoo doll of you

10:08.070 --> 10:10.110
out of rare gemstones
and dead crows.

10:10.130 --> 10:15.180
I have a master's degree.
This is crazy shit, Nicolas.

10:16.940 --> 10:20.030
You might take some reassurance
from the fact

10:20.050 --> 10:24.080
that so many of the people in
Trump's orbit did not do as he asked.

10:24.860 --> 10:28.070
But the worrying thing is, lots
of those people are gone now

10:28.840 --> 10:32.010
and the newer figures seem
on the same page as the president.

10:32.040 --> 10:36.010
Look at how the report was released.
Not only did William Barr,

10:36.030 --> 10:39.980
downplay its contents in his
letter summarizing it to Congress,

10:40.020 --> 10:43.980
but he gave a preemptive press
conference to spin report's contents,

10:44.020 --> 10:48.980
repeating Trump's favorite phrase
"no collusion" and making excuses.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.050
As the special counsel's
report acknowledges,

10:52.080 --> 10:55.980
there is substantial evidence
to show that the president

10:56.010 --> 10:59.930
was frustrated and
angered by his sincere belief

10:59.990 --> 11:03.070
that the investigation
was undermining his presidency,

11:03.910 --> 11:08.890
propelled by his political opponents
and fueled by illegal leaks.

11:09.060 --> 11:14.980
Donald Trump has never once been
motivated by a "sincere belief".

11:15.940 --> 11:19.900
He's motivated by two things only, one:
the icy howling winds

11:19.920 --> 11:23.930
swirling in the yawning chasm of pitch
blackness where his soul should be.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.980
And the hopeless pursuit of
the only woman he truly loves.

11:27.010 --> 11:31.000
When you look at his presidency
this way, it's actually quite romantic.

11:31.890 --> 11:35.040
If I may quote the advice
Alec Baldwin's attorney gives:

11:35.060 --> 11:38.940
"Being angry is not the same
thing as being innocent."

11:39.920 --> 11:42.070
That wasn't the only thing
that Barr said that,

11:42.840 --> 11:46.970
in the wake of reading the report,
seems laughably and misleading.

11:47.880 --> 11:51.870
The White House fully cooperated
with the counsel's investigation.

11:51.900 --> 11:55.070
The president took no act that
in fact deprived the special counsel

11:55.850 --> 11:59.910
of documents and witnesses necessary
to complete his investigation.

12:00.070 --> 12:05.010
A gross mischaracterization
of what the report actually said.

12:05.040 --> 12:09.000
"Full cooperation" would've involved
sitting down for an interview,

12:09.020 --> 12:10.850
which Trump did not do.

12:10.880 --> 12:14.020
Mueller not only found Trump's
written answers "inadequate",

12:14.040 --> 12:17.990
he engaged in efforts to curtail
the Special Counsel's investigation

12:18.470 --> 12:20.590
and prevent the disclosure
of evidence to it,

12:20.620 --> 12:24.660
including through public and private
contacts with potential witnesses.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.680
Which is the exact opposite
of what Barr said.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.580
It's like Barr summarized
Twilight as:

12:30.600 --> 12:33.590
"A girl in Florida goes
to third base with a Wookiee."

12:33.610 --> 12:37.480
No, that's not what happens.

12:37.580 --> 12:40.620
I'm not sure we're reading
the same underlying material.

12:40.650 --> 12:44.510
I've read the real book, a dog-man
falls in love with a baby.

12:44.560 --> 12:47.650
Respect the text.
Honor the written word.

12:48.610 --> 12:53.620
All of this is clearly very depressing.
There's still so much we don't know.

12:53.650 --> 12:56.650
There are significant
redactions within the report,

12:56.670 --> 13:00.650
references to 14 investigations
Mueller handed to other prosecutors,

13:00.670 --> 13:02.610
twelve of which remain secret.

13:02.630 --> 13:05.610
And that can make this
feel a little anticlimactic,

13:05.650 --> 13:07.680
ever since Barr's
summary came out,

13:08.460 --> 13:11.600
Trump administration's been
taking an un-earned victory lap.

13:11.620 --> 13:14.600
The idea that any of us,
and me as a campaign manager,

13:14.650 --> 13:20.480
would cheat, steal, lie, cut corners,
talk to Russians, was an insult.

13:20.780 --> 13:25.770
But was it, though?
An insult would be to say that

13:25.790 --> 13:29.600
Conway died many years ago
and is a skin suit occupied

13:29.620 --> 13:31.760
by 300 rats
who have evolved the ability to lie.

13:31.820 --> 13:36.740
That's what an insult is.
A fact, however...

13:36.810 --> 13:42.670
The Mueller report explicitly shows
Trump and his associates doing

13:42.690 --> 13:44.690
many of the things
she just listed.

13:44.710 --> 13:51.610
The report vindicates administration
on their own false premises.

13:51.660 --> 13:53.830
We pointed out that Trump
and his team were trying

13:54.600 --> 13:56.650
to center the narrative
on "collusion",

13:56.670 --> 14:00.720
despite the fact that the term
has no specific legal meaning.

14:00.770 --> 14:03.600
By reframing
the investigation that way,

14:03.620 --> 14:06.670
Trump ensured that anything
short of Mueller publishing

14:06.690 --> 14:10.720
400 pages of text messages between
him and Putin gaming out election fraud

14:10.740 --> 14:13.680
meant the whole thing
was a complete waste of time.

14:13.700 --> 14:16.790
Mueller's report did not find collusion
and wasn't trying to

14:16.810 --> 14:19.660
because that word
doesn't even apply here.

14:19.680 --> 14:23.710
And it didn't establish that Trump's
team was part of a criminal conspiracy

14:24.060 --> 14:25.280
to interfere with the election.

14:26.050 --> 14:28.080
But it found
a lot of other stuff.

14:28.180 --> 14:32.090
Consider what we learned,
or had confirmed, this week:

14:32.110 --> 14:36.120
Russia interfered in our election
and made efforts to help Trump win.

14:36.160 --> 14:40.190
While his campaign did not
provably cooperate with Russia,

14:40.210 --> 14:44.260
they seemed eager
to accept their help.

14:45.050 --> 14:48.150
Trump may have obstructed justice
and if he didn't,

14:48.170 --> 14:52.100
it might only be because people who
work for him ignored his orders.

14:52.120 --> 14:56.250
The attorney general, the nation's
top law-enforcement official,

14:56.270 --> 14:59.230
has proven himself
to be a dishonest hack.

15:00.060 --> 15:02.260
I'm not saying that
any of that is good news.

15:03.090 --> 15:06.050
But it is definitely good
that we know about it.

15:06.110 --> 15:09.270
Having the knowledge
that the Mueller report provides

15:10.040 --> 15:12.160
is infinitely better
than the alternative.

15:12.180 --> 15:15.220
'Cause that knowledge can
inform Congress going forward

15:15.250 --> 15:17.260
and voters
a year and a half from now.

15:18.060 --> 15:22.060
The alternative is for America
to end up like Michael Cohen:

15:22.100 --> 15:26.230
confused, easily manipulated
and never fully understanding

15:26.820 --> 15:28.990
how a guy with a fulltime job
as a press secretary

15:29.010 --> 15:32.870
can also be such a max-jacked
certifiable meat king.

15:33.850 --> 15:34.990
And now this.

15:35.980 --> 15:40.040
And Now, In Honor of Easter:
Fuck You, Peeps.

15:40.900 --> 15:45.840
If you love the Easter marshmallow
treat Peeps, you'll love this story.

15:45.880 --> 15:46.890
I hate 'em.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.890
Everybody hates Peeps!

15:50.000 --> 15:53.030
- Do you like regular Peeps?
- No. I would rather eat dirt.

15:53.810 --> 15:56.960
Fuck yeah! Dirt rules!
Peeps suck!

15:57.840 --> 16:00.010
Peeps are like the candy corn
around Halloween.

16:00.030 --> 16:02.980
You either love 'em or you don't,
like some people.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.820
We'll tell you about where you can
put or shove those Peeps.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.920
Hear that, America?
You can take your Peep

16:08.940 --> 16:11.860
and shove it all the way
up your actual asshole!

16:11.990 --> 16:17.820
I posted this to Facebook last week.
Marshmallow Peeps coffee creamer.

16:18.870 --> 16:21.890
No!

16:21.970 --> 16:25.830
- Where do you think Peeps is?
- It's not on the list, it's gross.

16:26.950 --> 16:29.860
- Not a fan of marshmallows?
- Not a fan of Peeps.

16:29.930 --> 16:33.020
The news lady is correct!
Peeps are gross!

16:33.860 --> 16:36.910
We continue talking about it
like they're really popular

16:36.930 --> 16:40.000
but
everybody I talk to is not a fan.

16:40.030 --> 16:44.860
That's right, Peep fans!
You don't exist!

16:48.030 --> 16:50.990
Moving on. With all
the talk of the Mueller report,

16:51.020 --> 16:54.920
we thought it might be nice to end
on the exact opposite of that.

16:54.970 --> 16:58.850
To do that, we turn to Japan:
the country that gave us Pokémon,

16:58.890 --> 17:01.960
and... my God,
it's a Jigglypuff!

17:02.830 --> 17:05.000
I've never seen one of these
in the wild before!

17:05.040 --> 17:08.880
Take out a Poké Ball
and slowly and carefully throw it.

17:08.930 --> 17:09.990
You ready? And...

17:10.849 --> 17:12.890
Throw! Throw it!

17:13.800 --> 17:19.010
God! You threw it too hard!
You killed Jigglypuff!

17:19.980 --> 17:24.829
Jigglypuff is dead now.
Why did you throw it so hard?

17:26.869 --> 17:29.850
Where was I?
That's right: Japan.

17:29.970 --> 17:32.980
There is something amazing
happening over there now.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.910
Japan is home
to thousands of mascots,

17:35.930 --> 17:38.960
from museums to prisons
to entire towns and cities.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
We loved that idea so much
that we made our own mascots

17:43.030 --> 17:45.880
for various U.S. government
agencies.

17:45.910 --> 17:50.810
We are not the only ones who've
decided to make some mascots.

17:50.930 --> 17:56.810
A rogue mascot is causing
controversy in one Japanese city.

17:56.850 --> 18:00.980
Meet Chiitan, the unsanctioned otter
mascot that is gaining popularity

18:01.000 --> 18:04.030
on social media thanks
to its edgy personality.

18:04.820 --> 18:08.000
Video of Chiitan swinging a weed
eater and you can see him there,

18:08.020 --> 18:09.830
dancing on a pole...

18:10.890 --> 18:15.800
Your eyes are not deceiving you:
that is video of a Japanese mascot

18:15.820 --> 18:18.040
on a stripper pole, presumably
at a strip club called

18:18.810 --> 18:21.970
"There Are Way More People Who Are
Into This Thing Than You Think."

18:21.990 --> 18:25.860
It is my honor tonight
to introduce you to Chiitan.

18:25.900 --> 18:28.870
You are gonna be glad that I did.
I know that he may look

18:29.100 --> 18:32.240
like half a Vienna Finger that took
too much ecstasy in the '90s,

18:32.260 --> 18:38.190
but Chiitan is a "0-year-old fairy baby
who plays around actively every day!"

18:38.260 --> 18:42.230
Chiitan is a giant otter wearing
a turtle as a hat,

18:42.250 --> 18:46.190
which is, incidentally, already
my favorite sentence of all time,

18:46.210 --> 18:50.110
right next to "Welcome to
the John Oliver Koala Chlamydia Ward."

18:50.180 --> 18:55.090
The story of what's going on with
Chiitan is a little complicated,

18:55.120 --> 18:58.170
but in a nutshell: there's
a city in Japan called Susaki.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.320
Susaki's official mascot
is Shinjo-kun,

19:01.110 --> 19:04.230
a magnificent giant otter
wearing a ramen dish for a hat.

19:05.190 --> 19:06.220
Excellent.

19:07.100 --> 19:10.280
Until recently, the city also had
a honorary "tourism ambassador",

19:10.300 --> 19:12.240
an actual otter named Chiitan.

19:12.260 --> 19:17.190
Chiitan the actual otter has a mascot
otter and that is what Chiitan is.

19:17.230 --> 19:20.250
There are three otters,
two of which are named "Chiitan"

19:20.270 --> 19:24.210
and the mascot Chiitan was never
affiliated with the city of Susaki.

19:24.230 --> 19:25.280
It's that simple.

19:26.260 --> 19:30.250
The unofficial mascot Chiitan has been
producing some bizarre videos,

19:30.780 --> 19:36.930
also this one where Chiitan
flips a car with its bare paws.

19:37.780 --> 19:41.910
Susaki reportedly received
over 100 calls from around Japan

19:41.930 --> 19:44.900
complaining about Chiitan,
and earlier this year,

19:44.920 --> 19:47.850
the city attempted to distance
themselves from it

19:47.870 --> 19:51.780
by declining to renew the real
Chiitan as its tourism ambassador.

19:51.800 --> 19:56.790
City cut ties with the otter because
of the things the fake otter did.

19:56.930 --> 20:00.800
Which is a real shame.
Chiitan has been a lot of fun,

20:00.840 --> 20:03.840
its Twitter account
is full of crazy shit like this.

20:20.950 --> 20:24.880
You might be wanting to ask:
"How does an umbrellawielding,"

20:24.900 --> 20:27.890
"coked-up otter being assaulted
in a windowless room"

20:27.920 --> 20:31.800
"encourage tourism to the small
Japanese port city of Susaki?"

20:31.940 --> 20:35.150
I'm on TV and I'm talking about
the small Japanese port city of Susaki.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.120
That should answer
your stupid fucking question.

20:38.160 --> 20:43.020
Every Chiitan video
is a work of art.

20:43.090 --> 20:46.090
Take this one, for example,
titled "With My Friends."

20:55.960 --> 20:59.140
It's understandable to have
questions after watching that, like:

20:59.160 --> 21:02.010
"What am I watching?
Who's that karate cat?"

21:02.040 --> 21:05.050
and "Why is Chiitan
angry with that inflatable pole?"

21:05.080 --> 21:08.160
"Am I bored?" is not one of
the questions you're asking there.

21:08.930 --> 21:10.140
Violence is a theme with Chiitan.

21:10.160 --> 21:14.110
Here is another video that starts
charming and then has a bit of a turn.

21:25.060 --> 21:28.030
It is a testament to the utter
brilliance of that video

21:28.060 --> 21:30.050
that I've watched it
dozens of times

21:30.080 --> 21:34.150
and not once have I thought to
whether or not that person was okay.

21:34.970 --> 21:38.950
It doesn't matter 'cause even if
they weren't, it was worth it.

21:39.890 --> 21:44.000
As good as these videos are,
Chiitan is even better at Twitter,

21:44.030 --> 21:46.850
with a virtuosic
deployment of memes.

21:46.910 --> 21:51.050
"Hello birb"...
Hello Pulitzer Prize for Poetry!

21:51.910 --> 21:54.950
Another magnificent example.
"Don't ever talk to my son"

21:54.970 --> 21:59.980
"or my son's son or my son's
son's son's son ever again".

22:00.010 --> 22:04.070
Try saying that without laughing.
It's physiologically impossible.

22:05.020 --> 22:08.080
Asking me to pick a favorite
Chiitan tweet is like asking me

22:08.850 --> 22:09.950
to pick a favorite son.

22:09.980 --> 22:13.010
Or son's son.
It'd be difficult

22:13.030 --> 22:16.040
but I'd probably have to say
this one, in which Chiitan,

22:16.060 --> 22:19.990
standing next to a small kangaroo
asks: "Is this a pigeon?"

22:20.930 --> 22:26.990
Clearly the question is rhetorical.
Chiitan is good at recognizing birbs.

22:27.870 --> 22:29.980
When's the last time
Twitter made you happy?

22:30.010 --> 22:32.920
When's the last time
anything made you happy?

22:33.040 --> 22:36.040
I admit that Chiitan's
occasionally gone a bit too far,

22:36.670 --> 22:39.870
like with this video titled
"Chiitan Is Going to Visit Your House."

22:57.720 --> 23:01.780
Even the most generous interpretation
of that is that Chiitan

23:01.800 --> 23:05.730
is gonna come to your house and
beat you to death with a baseball bat.

23:05.750 --> 23:08.760
I do get why a city might
not want that message delivered

23:08.780 --> 23:10.650
by an unofficial mascot.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.820
But I am sorry
for Susaki that he's gone.

23:12.850 --> 23:17.650
I'd also like you to spare a thought
for their official mascot, Shinjo-kun,

23:17.670 --> 23:19.820
who is also, as we've established:
excellent.

23:19.840 --> 23:23.730
Not as splashy as Chiitan,
but still wears a noodle-bowl for a hat

23:23.750 --> 23:25.680
and that's not nothing, is it?

23:25.720 --> 23:29.760
Shinjo-kun was overshadowed
by an psychotic otter.

23:29.790 --> 23:32.830
While there's an element
of relief there for Shinjo-kun,

23:32.850 --> 23:36.670
there's gonna be a massive,
Chiitan-shaped hole in its life.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.000
The two mascots were together
a lot, and I have to say,

23:39.770 --> 23:42.890
whever you see Shinjo-kun alone,
the obvious sadness there

23:42.910 --> 23:44.970
is absolutely heartbreaking.

23:45.850 --> 23:49.810
It's clear that Shinjo-kun
needs a new friend,

23:49.830 --> 23:53.860
one that won't disappear or threaten
the citizens with a baseball bat.

23:53.940 --> 23:58.800
Luckily, anyone can make an unofficial
mascot for a city in Japan.

23:58.840 --> 24:01.760
If you don't already know
where this is heading,

24:01.780 --> 24:04.800
you've clearly never watched
this fucking show before.

24:04.820 --> 24:08.970
Of course we made our own mascot.
Please meet Chiijohn.

24:09.920 --> 24:14.790
Chiijohn is a 41-year-old
nearsighted English fairy baby.

24:14.820 --> 24:17.870
When there's a new mascot
on this show, I get up

24:17.890 --> 24:20.920
and walk over there to introduce
you to him in person.

24:20.940 --> 24:24.840
I can't actually introduce you
to Chiijohn in person tonight.

24:24.930 --> 24:28.950
The reason I can't do that
is 'cause he's already in Japan.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.810
It's true! Here he is having
the time of his life in Tokyo!

24:33.940 --> 24:37.960
I know what you're thinking:
"I get it, John. You just created"

24:38.580 --> 24:40.720
"a mascot to go to Japan
and fuck with people."

24:40.740 --> 24:43.780
But no. You don't get it.
You don't get it at all.

24:44.620 --> 24:47.630
We made Chiijohn with
the sole intention that he locate

24:47.650 --> 24:51.590
and comfort Shinjo-kun, and fill
the hole Chiitan left in his heart.

24:51.610 --> 24:53.750
And for a sense of whether
he was able to do that,

24:53.780 --> 24:55.710
you should take a look at this.

24:56.560 --> 25:00.560
The Journey of Chiijohn

25:05.770 --> 25:09.680
After a long flight,
Chiijohn arrived in Tokyo.

25:11.800 --> 25:14.580
He'd never seen
anything like it,

25:15.670 --> 25:17.780
because he just
got glasses the day before.

25:21.620 --> 25:27.650
Tomorrow he'd visit Susaki,
but tonight belonged to Tokyo.

25:34.580 --> 25:37.700
Violently hungover, Chiijohn
got up the next morning.

25:38.570 --> 25:40.800
And as he looked through
the clouds towards Susaki,

25:41.640 --> 25:45.610
he remembered the reason
he was here: Shinjo-kun.

25:46.570 --> 25:49.690
He was 100 percent sure they were
meant to be together

25:50.580 --> 25:52.780
and 40 percent sure
he was looking at Susaki.

25:54.690 --> 25:58.640
All the way to the train station,
Chiijohn's heart pounded.

25:59.620 --> 26:02.600
Each step was a step
closer to his destiny.

26:05.570 --> 26:08.690
After a while, he got tired
of steps and took a rickshaw.

26:09.640 --> 26:13.630
Each step of his rickshaw driver
was a step closer to his destiny.

26:15.720 --> 26:20.610
At last, Susaki.
Shinjo-kun was everywhere,

26:20.770 --> 26:27.590
on the stairs, on the sidewalk,
on the walls and in the streets.

26:28.570 --> 26:32.580
On his way, Chiijohn introduced
himself to all the local fish.

26:33.680 --> 26:36.750
This is the path that falls
at Shinjo-kun's feet.

26:37.710 --> 26:41.580
This is the breeze
that cools Shinjo-kun's face.

26:42.640 --> 26:46.780
This is the sun that warms
the noodles that Shinjo-kun wears.

26:47.790 --> 26:50.880
And knowing this
filled Chiijohn with joy.

26:54.770 --> 26:57.720
The final steps to his
destiny were uphill.

26:58.720 --> 26:59.810
Aren't they always?

27:01.690 --> 27:06.790
Finally, Chiijohn saw Shinjo-kun,
his new best friend.

27:09.830 --> 27:13.720
Shinjo-kun didn't know
if he was ready for a new best friend.

27:13.850 --> 27:20.680
He had had a best friend, Chiitan.
And it had been a living nightmare.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.720
But Chiijohn seemed different,

27:24.750 --> 27:26.810
less upper body strength,
for one thing.

27:27.790 --> 27:32.710
At the local arcade, they used sticks
to whack moles, not each other.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.800
Though they share
an appetite for destruction,

27:35.830 --> 27:38.830
destroying something together
is an act of creation.

27:40.650 --> 27:44.760
Shinjo-kun made Chiijohn happy.
And Chiijohn wanted Shinjo-kun

27:45.150 --> 27:48.140
to have a Shinju-kun so Shinjo-kun
could be happy, too.

27:48.280 --> 27:53.220
But Chiijohn couldn't get Shinjo-kun
a Shinjo-kun and this made them sad.

27:54.220 --> 27:57.160
Sadness was another
thing they shared.

27:58.290 --> 28:00.340
Chiijohn tried to cheer
Shinjo-kun up.

28:02.310 --> 28:04.340
He put on Shinjo-kun's
thinking cap.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.240
Suddenly, he knew just
what to do:

28:08.220 --> 28:10.320
introduce themselves
to some local fish.

28:11.280 --> 28:15.320
Shinjo-kun taught Chiijohn how to
take one stick and make two sticks.

28:16.290 --> 28:18.340
It was the best day of their lives.

28:19.290 --> 28:21.360
Without the sadness
of the claw machine,

28:22.180 --> 28:24.280
Shinjo-kun never would have
felt this joy.

28:25.180 --> 28:27.180
If his old best friend hadn't left,

28:27.290 --> 28:30.210
his new best friend never
would have come.

28:32.160 --> 28:35.170
"That's too much soy sauce",
Shinjo-kun said.

28:36.130 --> 28:39.310
"No," replied Chiijohn, "it's not
enough fish."

28:40.330 --> 28:45.150
Shinjo-kun had found
his new best friend.

28:47.260 --> 28:49.280
A little chaos fulfills the spirit

28:49.370 --> 28:52.460
and prepares us
for all the claw machines ahead.

28:54.480 --> 29:00.350
They saw their path and felt
their breeze and saw their sun.

29:02.400 --> 29:05.370
"Where is our sun going?",
Chiijohn asked.

29:06.340 --> 29:08.350
"Do not worry",
said Shinjo-kun,

29:09.280 --> 29:11.290
"We'll have
our sun back tomorrow."

29:12.280 --> 29:16.310
"And our sun's son.
And our sun's son's son."

29:17.300 --> 29:21.240
"And our sun's son's son's son."

29:25.260 --> 29:28.340
None of us thought this was
where our show was going tonight

29:28.370 --> 29:30.240
and yet here we are now.

29:30.350 --> 29:32.470
Chiijohn is still in Japan.

29:33.250 --> 29:36.350
The City of Susaki have now
officially taken ownership of him.

29:36.370 --> 29:40.390
If you ever want to see Chiijohn,
you'll simply have to go there.

29:40.440 --> 29:45.390
That is our show. Thank you.
We're off next week. Good night!

29:47.010 --> 29:50.020
