00:16.000 --> 00:17.880
OK.K.

00:17.960 --> 00:20.200
What was that?

00:20.320 --> 00:22.280
Carter?

00:22.920 --> 00:26.400
I don't know, sir. The margin of error
in calculating planetary shift

00:26.520 --> 00:29.320
used to cause the rough ride,
but we fixed it.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.960
Carter.

00:32.080 --> 00:35.840
We did have to override some of the
dialling protocols in order to get a lock.

00:35.960 --> 00:39.280
I'll check the dialling computer
when we get home.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.520
- It's bright.
- Yes, sir.

00:41.640 --> 00:45.000
This planet's much closer
to its sun than Earth.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.440
Festive.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.240
This is interesting.

00:54.480 --> 00:57.880
I couldn't see these writings
through the MALP.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
What's it say?

00:59.120 --> 01:01.160
The symbols are like those on Cimmeria.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.680
There could be a connection
here to the Asgard.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.200
- What's it say?
- I don't know.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.200
You think it's a protected planet?

01:09.320 --> 01:11.360
Well, Teal'c wasn't zapped away.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.480
There is no Thor's hammer here.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.960
Well, they wouldn't need one if it was
named in the Goa'uld-Asgard Treaty.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.920
Hey! You!

01:23.960 --> 01:25.920
Come on out.

01:26.840 --> 01:30.600
We're not here to hurt you.
We're explorers from a place called Earth.

01:30.720 --> 01:35.480
You might know it as Midgardr.
I'm Daniel Jackson. This is, uh...

01:35.600 --> 01:39.560
I am Elrad, flamen of
the 39th OK.rder of K'Tau.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.720
My congregation and I were
on our way here for morning prayer

01:44.800 --> 01:48.560
when we saw a great wave
burst forth from the Annulus.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.840
Annulus. I like that.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.600
He is an enemy of the gods.

01:58.040 --> 02:01.320
Not any more. Thor loves this guy.

02:01.440 --> 02:04.240
- You know of Thor?
- OK.h, yeah. He's a buddy.

02:07.320 --> 02:10.639
Come forth. It is a time for rejoicing.

02:10.759 --> 02:13.320
Freyr has sent us visitors from Midgardr.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.160
Freyr is the god of sun and rain, right?

02:16.280 --> 02:19.560
Yes, our protector. Ally of Thor.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.400
Friends of the gods are welcome here.

02:22.920 --> 02:27.040
- What have you got here?
- Please, come. OK.ur village is this way.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.920
It's as if Norse culture
evolved into modern times

02:53.000 --> 02:55.960
while continuing to worship
the ancient gods.

02:58.440 --> 03:02.120
This is Brother Malchus.
He is chief acolyte within our order.

03:02.240 --> 03:05.120
You must leave. At once.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.240
- We just got here.
- These are not just any strangers.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.560
They came through the Annulus.

03:10.680 --> 03:14.400
- This one bears the mark of evil.
- He is a friend of Thor.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.560
The people will not stand for this.

03:17.680 --> 03:22.040
You mean you will antagonise them
until they agree with you.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.160
Friendly guy.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.160
You must forgive Malchus.
He has a suspicious nature,

03:34.280 --> 03:37.000
and we have never before
been visited by elves.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.760
Elves?

03:42.200 --> 03:46.080
You travel by way of the gods.
You say you know them well.

03:46.160 --> 03:51.360
In Norse mythology, Freyr was the ruler of
the elves. They bring good or bad tidings.

03:51.480 --> 03:54.600
We certainly hope
you have come to wish us well.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.960
Carter, what just happened?

04:17.880 --> 04:19.760
The eye of OK.din grows dim.

04:20.279 --> 04:25.160
- Some sort of shift in the light frequency.
- Good. I thought I was havin' a stroke.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.360
You did this!

04:27.480 --> 04:29.360
- What?
- Be calm.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.880
- Is it true?
- No.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.800
- Is it?
- I don't know, sir.

04:37.200 --> 04:41.240
It is no coincidence that this happens
moments after they arrive.

04:41.320 --> 04:44.200
The elves are the harbingers of our doom!

06:06.320 --> 06:07.960
Leave us or be driven out.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.920
The darkening of the eye of OK.din
is the will of the gods.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.160
You cannot blame the messengers.

06:13.280 --> 06:17.480
We must go to the hall of wisdom
and pray for forgiveness.

06:27.560 --> 06:32.320
That sounds like the place where
the Cimmerians communicated with Thor.

06:41.320 --> 06:44.360
Carter, what the heck's goin' on?

06:44.440 --> 06:48.040
Somehow the light spectrum of the sun
has shifted toward infrared.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.720
If it continues,
all the green plants will die.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.800
With the plants goes the oxygen supply...

06:53.920 --> 06:58.040
The MALP should give us more detailed
data. Its sensors are more sophisticated.

06:58.120 --> 07:01.480
Good. You and Teal'c
head back to the... Annulus.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.120
See what you can find out. Daniel.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.600
See if these folks
have got an Asgard phone.

07:07.880 --> 07:11.200
(Elrad) We beseech thee, OK. Freyr,
to have mercy upon us.

07:11.560 --> 07:15.240
Make peace with our great father OK.din,
and, in doing so,

07:15.360 --> 07:19.320
remove the terrible curse
from our gentle land.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.200
In the name of our Lord Freyr, be it so.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.600
We...

07:26.760 --> 07:28.720
(whispering)

07:33.000 --> 07:35.960
Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.

07:36.040 --> 07:39.600
- Haven't you done enough damage, elf?
- Some respect, Malchus.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.880
They are sent by the gods.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.080
We should hear their words.

07:44.200 --> 07:48.080
We were just wondering
if you ever speak directly to Freyr.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.840
He hears us always.

07:51.760 --> 07:56.040
Right. You mentioned a hall of wisdom.
This is it, isn't it?

07:56.320 --> 07:58.760
No. This is a temple.

07:58.880 --> 07:59.960
Right.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.400
Malchus and I were about to go to the hall

08:02.520 --> 08:05.160
to seek Freyr's wisdom
on behalf of our people.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.680
- Could we go with you?
- We could put in a good word.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.760
By all means, come.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.840
Bow your heads
and prepare to meet our Lord.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.360
Lord Freyr, Lord of the Aesir,
God of K'Tau,

08:31.040 --> 08:34.400
grant us an audience
that we may share your wisdom.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.440
I'd better get it back.

08:54.840 --> 08:58.560
I am Freyr. For what reason
have you come before me?

08:58.680 --> 09:03.200
OK. Lord Freyr, forgive us for disturbing
you, but we seek your wisdom.

09:03.320 --> 09:07.040
The arrival of these outsiders has
caused the eye of OK.din to grow dim.

09:07.160 --> 09:10.600
- We fear it is Ragnarok.
- That's the end of time.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.240
Thank you.

09:12.360 --> 09:15.240
We beg you to restore OK.din's light.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.480
You are wise to seek my counsel,

09:18.560 --> 09:22.160
but only through faith will you
prove worthy of my benevolence.

09:22.280 --> 09:26.760
Do we put them to death? They could be
drawn and quartered before nightfall.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.760
That's a bit harsh, isn't it?

09:28.880 --> 09:32.560
In time, I will sail to the plain of Vigrid,

09:32.680 --> 09:35.160
where my battle
will be fought with Surtur.

09:35.280 --> 09:38.760
- He fights Surtur. It is the end time.
- Patience.

09:39.720 --> 09:42.680
Likewise, you must face your own fears

09:42.760 --> 09:45.400
as you now enter the ultimate conflict.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.720
How you deal with fear
will prove your worthiness.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.840
I wish you well on your voyage.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.120
It's a recording.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.000
Really?

10:12.440 --> 10:14.800
I told you.

10:17.120 --> 10:22.400
It is Ragnarok. Lord Freyr
tells us to prepare for our death.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.880
That's a bit of a negative spin
with the old paraphrasing.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.640
I have been interpreting
the word of the gods for many years.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.320
I'm afraid I must agree with Malchus.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.080
Hang on.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.960
Look, I know I'm the outsider here...

10:44.080 --> 10:47.280
You dare question the will of the gods?

10:47.360 --> 10:49.760
No, just your interpretation.

10:51.680 --> 10:56.440
- Sure you wanna get into this?
- I'm not sure how to get out of this.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.120
Look, folks,

11:02.240 --> 11:05.760
does Freyr plant your crops for you?

11:05.880 --> 11:07.840
(congregation) No.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.160
Does he harvest them?

11:11.280 --> 11:13.440
Does he build your homes for you?

11:13.560 --> 11:16.120
Those are the tasks of our own hands.

11:16.240 --> 11:20.960
Exactly. You've always had
free will before. Why not now?

11:21.720 --> 11:26.760
Maybe this ultimate conflict is just
a test of your... ingenuity and courage.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.320
Why do you tolerate this?

11:29.440 --> 11:31.680
- Jump in.
- I don't think this is a good idea.

11:31.800 --> 11:35.080
In the past, Lord Freyr
has always told us to face our fears

11:35.200 --> 11:37.840
and not interfere with
the ways of the gods.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.320
I agree, Malchus.
We must do the gods' will,

11:40.440 --> 11:42.920
but perhaps these strangers
are a part of their plan.

11:43.040 --> 11:47.240
Nonsense! They are
the harbingers of our doom!

11:49.040 --> 11:51.840
Elves cannot change the will of the gods.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.880
Elrad, listen to me.

12:08.760 --> 12:12.160
We can help your people.
We've been in this situation before.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.680
Trust me. We can work miracles.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.760
I trust in Freyr.

12:17.920 --> 12:22.680
If you are here to do his bidding,
either to doom us or to save us,

12:23.960 --> 12:25.920
then so be it.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.160
Miracles?

12:34.480 --> 12:38.240
Yeah. That's what it'll look like to them.

12:39.160 --> 12:44.360
- That's what what will look like to them?
- Whatever Carter comes up with.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.560
Hey, fellas.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.920
I got a theory, sir.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.000
Is it miraculous?

13:01.000 --> 13:04.200
Actually, it is. I think the wormhole
that we used to travel here

13:04.320 --> 13:06.960
passed directly through this planet's sun.

13:07.040 --> 13:10.080
That might be why we had
a problem dialling here.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.040
We should never have connected?

13:12.120 --> 13:15.160
At least not with the current
planetary alignment.

13:15.280 --> 13:19.400
The light from the sun suddenly shifted
to the red spectrum after we got here.

13:19.520 --> 13:24.240
The only way that could happen
was if an unstable superheavy element,

13:24.360 --> 13:28.640
probably plutonium, was introduced
to the sun's nuclear reaction.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.320
- Sort of a subatomic poisoning.
- OK.K. How did we do that?

13:32.440 --> 13:34.400
Well, somehow,

13:34.520 --> 13:38.320
the plutonium piggybacked onto
our wormhole from another star system,

13:38.440 --> 13:41.400
then bonded with their sun
as we passed through it.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.880
I hope that doesn't mean it's our fault.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.280
We could not have known, OK.'Neill.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.840
The fact that the gate wouldn't dial here

13:48.960 --> 13:52.640
Ieads me to believe that some safety
protocol was built into the gate system,

13:52.760 --> 13:55.000
designed to prevent this sort of thing.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.440
So, design flaw?

13:58.480 --> 14:00.120
No.

14:00.240 --> 14:04.040
Sir, we bypassed some of
the normal dialling protocols.

14:04.160 --> 14:07.840
The fact is, this planet is dying
and it's probably because of us.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.880
But you can fix it, right?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.720
Hey, Teal'c. Maybe you should
hang out here.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.800
These Asgard devices
don't know you like we do.

14:57.360 --> 15:00.880
OK.K, let's see. They bowed
their heads and said a prayer.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.200
Lord Freyr, Lord of the Aesir...
OK.r we could just go straight to that.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.760
I am Freyr. For what reason
have you come before me?

15:18.840 --> 15:22.800
We'd like to talk to the real Asgard.
Thor, if he's available.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.320
You are wise to seek my counsel.

15:25.440 --> 15:29.200
But only through faith will you
prove worthy of my benevolence.

15:29.320 --> 15:32.560
Yada-yada. Carter, you wanna
pull the plug on this guy?

15:32.680 --> 15:36.280
It looks like this is the emitter
that's generating the...

15:42.120 --> 15:45.080
(Daniel) We've either made contact
with the Asgard or...

15:45.200 --> 15:48.560
trapped ourselves deep
within a vault of solid rock.

15:51.920 --> 15:56.680
- (O'Neill) Much better.
- I am Freyr, protector of the K'Tau world.

15:58.320 --> 16:02.000
Yeah, so listen, sorry to bother you.
Can we talk to Thor?

16:02.480 --> 16:07.120
Commander Thor is in a distant part
of the galaxy and unavailable.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.600
You are the one called OK.'Neill.

16:10.440 --> 16:11.840
I am the one.

16:11.920 --> 16:15.720
We named a warship after you,
short-lived as it was.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.360
Yes. That one.

16:19.480 --> 16:22.120
Why have you come to this world?

16:22.200 --> 16:24.200
Exploring. That's what we do.

16:24.720 --> 16:28.840
K'Tau falls under our protected planet
treaty with the Goa'uld.

16:28.960 --> 16:32.680
I would hope you have not dispelled
their current belief system.

16:32.800 --> 16:37.360
- The Asgard felt it was essential.
- No, we haven't blown your cover.

16:38.760 --> 16:44.360
However, we... do have
a small little problem

16:44.480 --> 16:47.280
that could use some of
that Asgard magic.

16:47.400 --> 16:51.360
Are you implying that our technology
is some kind of trickery?

16:53.720 --> 16:57.760
- You sure Thor's not around somewhere?
- Sir, if I may.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.400
Yeah. Knock yourself out.

17:02.840 --> 17:05.480
We may have inadvertently,
totally accidentally,

17:05.599 --> 17:08.800
caused a foreign element
to enter the K'Tau sun.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.640
How?

17:10.760 --> 17:13.640
Well, actually, I was hoping
you could help us on that one.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.560
Is it possible that
we picked up a superheavy element

17:16.640 --> 17:19.200
and carried it into the sun
as we passed through?

17:19.319 --> 17:22.760
There are safety protocols
in place within the Stargate system

17:22.880 --> 17:27.319
to prevent wormhole connections
that would result in such events.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.480
Yeah. See, we have
our own dialling computer

17:30.560 --> 17:34.160
and sometimes we bypass
a few steps in order to get a lock.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.880
- We're still experimenting.
- I see.

17:38.680 --> 17:43.120
- We could really use your help here.
- I'm afraid I cannot assist you.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.400
Why not?

17:45.520 --> 17:49.880
It is not the Asgard's responsibility
to undo every error you make

17:50.000 --> 17:52.800
with technology that is advanced
beyond your knowledge.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.920
Excuse me!

17:55.360 --> 17:59.080
There is a whole planet
full of people that are going to die.

17:59.960 --> 18:03.160
This may be our mistake,
but the K'Tau people depend on you.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.160
You set up their belief system. They think
you're their god and will protect them.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.440
From the Goa'uld, yes.

18:09.560 --> 18:12.360
Forget all that! Come on, we're friends.

18:12.440 --> 18:16.400
We help you, you help us.
That's the way it works.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.200
Carter's idea saved you
from the replicators.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.840
Now we're calling in the marker.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.680
Ultimately, the decision is not mine.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.160
Then may I speak to whomever decides?

18:33.120 --> 18:35.080
It is possible.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.080
Prepare to meet the Asgard High Council.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.520
I'm prepared. Right now. Let's go.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.560
Step into the place where I stand.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.240
- I'm sort of prepared.
- Do you want me...?

18:52.360 --> 18:54.320
I got it.

19:04.760 --> 19:06.720
(echoes) Hello?

19:10.120 --> 19:12.080
(echoes) Echo!

19:24.880 --> 19:29.600
Colonel Jack OK.'Neill of Earth, welcome
to the Asgard High Council chamber.

19:29.720 --> 19:32.920
Yeah, listen, thanks for
seeing me on such short notice.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.280
I assume you can see me.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.960
Yes.

19:38.480 --> 19:41.280
- Did Freyr mention why I'm here?
- Yes, Colonel.

19:41.360 --> 19:45.080
They're aware of the circumstances
surrounding your request.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.000
OK.h, hey. There you are.

19:47.120 --> 19:50.320
Didn't see ya. You guys all kinda look...

19:55.080 --> 19:57.880
- Thor's not here, right?
- He is not.

19:58.720 --> 19:59.400
OK.K.

19:59.520 --> 20:04.640
As Freyr explained, we are unable
to assist you in this matter, OK.'Neill.

20:04.720 --> 20:10.080
Though your actions were unintentional,
it will mean the K'Tau people will perish.

20:10.200 --> 20:14.480
Hey! This is not entirely our fault.

20:14.600 --> 20:19.640
I mean, you could have warned us about
this crazy gate-through-the-sun thing.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.040
You could have given us a list
of all the planets that are off limits.

20:23.160 --> 20:25.120
Both points are true.

20:25.240 --> 20:28.440
However, neither is reason
enough to interfere.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.440
You're interfering right now!

20:31.560 --> 20:33.960
These people think you're their gods!

20:34.080 --> 20:38.360
You're not the Goa'ulds, but you're still
pretending to be something you're not.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.360
You are correct.

20:40.480 --> 20:44.360
However, when we saved
these people from the Goa'uld,

20:44.480 --> 20:48.160
they were not ready to have
their beliefs completely stripped away.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.840
In time, when they are ready,
the K'Tau will learn the truth.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.400
Yeah, see... there's the snag.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.560
They won't. They'll be dead.

21:00.160 --> 21:03.480
I don't get it.
You obviously saved them once.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.560
Why not this time?

21:05.680 --> 21:08.560
- It is not that simple.
- Yes, it is!

21:08.640 --> 21:11.440
- You've got the technology, don't you?
- Yes.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.520
OK.K. Fine.

21:15.480 --> 21:19.680
We made a mistake, a big mistake.

21:19.760 --> 21:26.120
And we're very sorry. But we also saved
your little grey butts from the replicators,

21:26.240 --> 21:28.120
and now we want your help.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.440
I'm not asking you to change the course
of their cultural development.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.760
Just fix the damn sun!

21:33.880 --> 21:37.760
No one'll know. We won't tell.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.920
Unfortunately, we cannot.

21:43.560 --> 21:49.680
OK.K. At the risk of sounding like
the petulant inferior race, why not?

21:52.400 --> 21:54.120
(alien language)

21:57.600 --> 21:59.960
- "Little grey butts."
- Yeah.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.800
It would be in violation
of our treaty with the Goa'uld.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.920
What?

22:11.560 --> 22:15.600
The treaty states that the people
of a planet categorised as "protected"

22:15.680 --> 22:18.400
will be free from Goa'uld domination.

22:18.480 --> 22:22.360
However, subsection 42 states
that the people on those planets

22:22.440 --> 22:27.080
cannot be artificially advanced
through Asgard technological means.

22:27.200 --> 22:32.400
Using our technology to prevent a natural
disaster would be a violation of that order

22:32.480 --> 22:34.880
and would nullify the treaty as a whole.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.560
The Goa'uld would be free to invade
any of the protected planets,

22:39.680 --> 22:42.040
including Earth.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.960
OK.h.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.400
- You sure?
- Yes.

22:48.520 --> 22:52.560
The war with the replicators
wages on here in our galaxy.

22:52.680 --> 22:57.960
We do not have the forces to defend
every planet covered under the treaty.

22:58.080 --> 23:01.040
You would be vulnerable
to Goa'uld attack.

23:02.200 --> 23:06.640
OK.K. What if I were to say
we're willing to take the risk?

23:07.080 --> 23:10.800
Even if you could make that decision
on behalf of your planet,

23:10.920 --> 23:14.880
you cannot make it for every
other planet that would be affected.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.360
I suppose not.

23:18.600 --> 23:23.400
We are all greatly disturbed
that this disaster cannot be averted.

23:23.520 --> 23:26.080
We wish there was a way.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.800
Well, they're not dead yet. Maybe there is.

23:30.920 --> 23:34.680
If that is the case,
the solution will be up to you.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.400
Fine.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.240
That went well.

23:59.240 --> 24:03.200
- Sir, I've been thinking.
- I'd be shocked if you ever stopped.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.560
Here.

24:07.520 --> 24:08.840
OK.K.

24:11.600 --> 24:15.480
Let's say these are the unstable plutonium
molecules that are poisoning the sun.

24:15.600 --> 24:16.800
OK.K.

24:16.920 --> 24:20.600
What if these are molecules
of a more stable superheavy element?

24:20.720 --> 24:23.920
Say, something with
an atomic weight above 200.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.120
- Sure. I can think of a few.
- They don't occur in nature, not on Earth.

24:29.200 --> 24:33.240
But I've read about such elements being
created in supercolliders - in theory.

24:33.360 --> 24:36.080
You realise you're mixing
your apples and your...

24:36.160 --> 24:40.880
Now, if we could introduce these stable
superheavies into the K'Tau sun,

24:41.000 --> 24:44.400
they would bind with the plutonium
molecules, rendering them inert.

24:44.520 --> 24:48.280
The sun could then be restored
to its normal nuclear reaction.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.640
How about that?

24:50.760 --> 24:53.160
Well, this is all very theoretical, sir.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.440
I have great confidence in you, Carter.

24:55.560 --> 24:59.680
Go on back to the SGC and...
confuse Hammond.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.680
Yes, sir.

25:13.560 --> 25:14.360
A rocket?

25:14.480 --> 25:16.960
With a payload of
the superheavy element.

25:17.080 --> 25:20.480
We send it in stages through the Stargate
to K'Tau and assemble it there.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.560
When it's complete,
we launch it into their sun.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.280
Will it get there in time?

25:25.360 --> 25:29.560
We have three months before the
plutonium reaction becomes irreversible.

25:29.680 --> 25:32.480
If we can launch inside three weeks,
we'll just make it.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.280
Any other options?

25:34.400 --> 25:38.160
The other option turned out to be
a one-in-a-million shot, sir.

25:38.280 --> 25:41.720
The rocket gives us
better than 50-50 odds.

25:41.840 --> 25:45.520
- Rockets don't exactly grow on trees.
- I know that, sir.

25:45.640 --> 25:49.240
However, the air force is currently
preparing a launch from Vandenberg.

25:49.360 --> 25:52.480
Do you realise how much
has been invested in that project?

25:52.560 --> 25:57.120
I'm aware of that, sir. It's hard
to put a price on the K'Tau people.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.320
Colonel.

26:10.920 --> 26:14.880
- Shouldn't you be off inciting a mob?
- Look at the sky.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.120
Ragnarok grows ever closer.
Your machine does nothing.

26:18.200 --> 26:19.840
It's a rocket.

26:19.920 --> 26:24.200
It won't work until we launch it.
We can't launch it until we build it.

26:24.280 --> 26:28.000
Time still remains before the sun
does permanent damage to your world.

26:28.120 --> 26:31.480
All they have done
is bring more outsiders.

26:31.600 --> 26:33.160
You have to be patient.

26:33.240 --> 26:37.120
The problem grows ever worse
as long as you are here.

26:38.280 --> 26:42.960
If you can't see that the gods wish you to
leave, we will be forced to make it clear.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.800
Malchus, this is not the way of the K'Tau.

26:45.880 --> 26:48.840
If the gods did not want them here,
they wouldn't be here.

26:48.960 --> 26:52.160
If their presence is truly part of a test,

26:52.240 --> 26:54.800
then we have failed... miserably.

27:24.280 --> 27:26.240
General, we're ahead of schedule.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.360
This should be the last shipment of parts.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.720
Any word yet on the HU-2340?

27:30.840 --> 27:34.720
Quite frankly, I never expected it
to be easier to get the rocket.

27:34.840 --> 27:38.960
Sir, without the superheavy element,
it will have been a giant waste of time.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.000
Don't worry, Major.

27:50.880 --> 27:52.280
Dr MacLaren.

27:52.400 --> 27:55.200
Very impressive operation
you've got here.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.480
I hope you consider yourself lucky, Major.

27:59.560 --> 28:03.920
Dr MacLaren finally decided a peek
at the SGC was worth the exchange.

28:09.320 --> 28:12.800
It took me five years
to make that much HU-2340.

28:12.920 --> 28:17.480
Well, maybe one day you'll be able to visit
the planet that your Maclarium is saving.

28:17.960 --> 28:20.680
Did you say Maclarium?

28:20.800 --> 28:25.760
Sounds like a good name to me. I'll use it
in my official report to the Pentagon.

28:27.520 --> 28:31.400
I don't wanna be in your way.
You've obviously got a job to do here.

28:31.480 --> 28:33.600
- Good luck, Major.
- Thank you, Doctor.

28:44.200 --> 28:47.320
That's the last of it, sir.
We've got everything we need.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.360
- Good.
- Daniel and Teal'c?

28:50.080 --> 28:55.200
They're in the village. Still trying to
convince the folks we're friendly elves.

28:55.320 --> 28:58.680
I think the sooner
we get outta here the better.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.720
Is that smoke?

29:12.040 --> 29:14.160
- What happened?
- Somebody set a fire.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.120
Anybody hurt?

29:15.240 --> 29:17.520
Two members of SG-6.
The rocket was destroyed.

29:17.640 --> 29:21.600
- Stupid son of a bitch!
- The gods have spoken.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.680
You just killed two of my men
and screwed your whole planet!

29:24.800 --> 29:28.680
Two of our brothers also gave
their lives to serve the gods.

29:28.760 --> 29:32.720
You coward! Why didn't you
do it yourself? Why?

29:32.800 --> 29:36.760
- I would gladly die to serve the gods.
- Maybe you should.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.160
- Jack!
- Sir!

29:39.280 --> 29:42.480
Stop, please! I'm truly sorry
for what has happened,

29:42.600 --> 29:44.960
but Malchus acted without my knowledge.

29:45.080 --> 29:49.280
He will be punished,
but, please, more death serves no one!

30:00.400 --> 30:04.160
More death is exactly
what you people are gonna get.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.840
Jack, stop! We can't leave.

30:33.960 --> 30:37.760
The hell we can't. Carter, dial it up.
Get these people home. That's an order!

30:37.880 --> 30:41.000
- Jack, would you stop?!
- They killed two of my men!

30:41.080 --> 30:44.480
Yes, they did. But not all these people
are responsible for that,

30:44.600 --> 30:48.240
and even the ones that were were just
doing what they believed was right.

30:48.360 --> 30:50.720
- I really don't care.
- Well, I do.

30:53.880 --> 30:56.080
Leaving now would be irredeemable.

30:56.200 --> 30:59.400
In whose eyes? The Asgard?
They had their chance.

30:59.520 --> 31:02.400
I pressed the button
that could end this civilisation.

31:02.520 --> 31:06.480
All right! We made the first mistake,
but we were gonna fix it.

31:07.120 --> 31:09.840
Is it obvious only to me
that they don't want help?

31:09.920 --> 31:13.160
I couldn't live with myself
if I just walked away now.

31:13.280 --> 31:18.640
I do not believe the majority of people of
this world support the actions of Malchus.

31:21.240 --> 31:23.280
- What then?
- Relocate them.

31:25.040 --> 31:28.840
- Their ties to this world are strong.
- We have to give them the option.

31:31.720 --> 31:35.840
- Then it's their choice.
- Sir, we still have the Maclarium.

31:35.920 --> 31:41.120
With your permission, I'd like to return to
the SGC and run a few more simulations.

31:46.080 --> 31:49.840
OK.K. I know this world has been
your home for generations.

31:51.080 --> 31:55.120
But it looks now like the eye of OK.din
will not be restored.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.240
That is for the gods to decide.

31:57.360 --> 32:02.400
Right. But consider this - that the gods
are giving you another choice.

32:03.520 --> 32:06.920
- What is that?
- The chance to move to another world.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.520
You can come through the Annulus
with us. It's very simple.

32:12.640 --> 32:15.520
If Freyr wished us to leave this world,

32:15.640 --> 32:18.840
he would come to take us away
in his chariot.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.960
He does. He wishes you to leave.

32:22.080 --> 32:26.520
He's very busy right now
and he sent us to take you our way.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.960
If you don't go, you will all die.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.000
Your efforts are noble.

32:33.920 --> 32:37.280
But if our destruction
is the will of the gods,

32:37.400 --> 32:40.360
we must face our fate bravely.

32:57.120 --> 32:59.080
Now can we go?

33:00.880 --> 33:03.240
- K'Tau were not convinced?
- No.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.480
Because you didn't say
what needed to be said.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.960
Well, what would you have said?

33:10.920 --> 33:13.280
Wait, what are you gonna say?

33:20.440 --> 33:23.240
Hey, folks! You wanna join me over here?

33:24.520 --> 33:26.480
Come on.

33:28.080 --> 33:31.440
Here, folks. I got a few things I wanna say.

33:31.560 --> 33:34.880
- What are you doing?
- Telling them the truth, Daniel.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.200
Whether God exists is not as important
as whether a belief in God exists.

33:40.320 --> 33:44.040
- What if we were talking about a Goa'uld?
- We're not talking about a Goa'uld.

33:44.160 --> 33:46.640
Have we not made our position clear?

33:46.760 --> 33:51.560
Yes. Yes, you have. I just don't think
we've made ourselves clear.

33:52.040 --> 33:55.000
- Jack, the Asgard...
- Are not gods.

34:00.240 --> 34:04.440
Hi, folks. Listen, you all know Freyr, right?

34:04.560 --> 34:08.679
Big guy, kinda good-looking,
a lot of fancy gold armour.

34:09.639 --> 34:13.840
Well, here's a flash for you.
That's not what he looks like.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.520
What do you mean?

34:18.880 --> 34:22.840
He's an alien who's been
pretending to be your god.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.639
(muttering)

34:27.360 --> 34:30.760
He doesn't have a chariot.
He's got a spaceship.

34:34.199 --> 34:35.760
Spaceship.

34:35.840 --> 34:39.800
Big machine, like the one we were
building, only his is way better,

34:39.880 --> 34:42.239
and not blown up.

34:42.960 --> 34:47.320
I'm not kiddin' you, folks.
This little fella is about three feet tall,

34:47.400 --> 34:49.800
got clammy, grey skin, big black eyes

34:49.920 --> 34:54.199
and skinny, tiny little arms and legs,
like toothpicks.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.080
They think you need to believe in a god,

35:03.200 --> 35:06.680
that you're not developed enough
as a culture to think for yourselves.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.800
- Enough!
- Elrad, listen to me.

35:09.360 --> 35:14.640
These aliens have the power to help you.
They chose not to.

35:14.720 --> 35:17.360
I am sorry for what happened
to your people.

35:18.080 --> 35:21.040
I know you think you are trying to help us,

35:21.120 --> 35:25.560
but, please, it is time for you to leave.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.560
OK.K.

35:42.680 --> 35:46.960
Sorry to bother you.
Thanks for your time, folks.

35:51.200 --> 35:54.560
There. Gave them a choice.
They chose. Let's go.

36:13.400 --> 36:17.040
I thought the odds of success for
this scenario were one in a million, Major.

36:17.160 --> 36:21.920
Yes, sir, but I now think that we can
increase that estimate to one per cent.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.000
It's your call, General.

36:25.080 --> 36:29.440
I only understand about one per cent
of what she says half the time.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.880
Run it by me again.

36:39.600 --> 36:42.920
We send the Maclarium
through the wormhole to K'Tau.

36:43.680 --> 36:47.120
Now, based on the distance from Earth
and the rate of travel,

36:47.240 --> 36:50.640
I've tried to calculate the exact time
we should shut down the gate

36:50.760 --> 36:53.320
so the Maclarium stops short
of reaching the planet

36:53.440 --> 36:56.480
and actually ends up in their sun.

36:56.600 --> 37:02.200
I thought when something was in
a wormhole, it existed only as energy,

37:02.280 --> 37:05.400
that you needed another Stargate
to turn it back into solid matter.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.880
Actually, you're absolutely correct, sir.

37:10.440 --> 37:12.640
- I am?
- Yes.

37:12.760 --> 37:15.120
It's the Stargate on the other side

37:15.240 --> 37:18.680
that actually reintegrates the matter
into its pre-organised form.

37:18.800 --> 37:23.000
Without it, the energy in the wormhole
would rematerialise in its base form.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.280
In the case of a person,
that would be bad,

37:25.400 --> 37:29.040
but in the case of an element,
it shouldn't be a problem.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.120
I was right.

37:31.240 --> 37:33.800
OK.K. You have a go, Major.

37:43.080 --> 37:45.440
(Carter) Sending the MALP through.

37:51.480 --> 37:52.720
Payload is en route.

37:58.720 --> 38:01.920
Executing controlled shutdown... now.

38:06.160 --> 38:09.120
Well, there's only one way
to know if it worked.

38:13.840 --> 38:17.720
Brothers and sisters,
in these troubled times,

38:17.840 --> 38:21.080
it is important for us
to come together as a family.

38:21.200 --> 38:25.080
We must remember
the great gifts of Freyr,

38:26.120 --> 38:30.320
and we must be grateful
for the lives that he has given us.

38:31.200 --> 38:35.560
In this troubled time,
we must still remember...

38:36.120 --> 38:41.640
He agreed to let us stay, so long as we
stop trying to tell them Freyr is not a god.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.800
I don't think we'll be staying.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.960
Did your method not succeed,
Major Carter?

38:48.080 --> 38:50.880
It doesn't look good. I think we missed.

38:51.720 --> 38:54.840
Are you sure it's not just taking
longer than you thought or...?

38:54.960 --> 38:58.160
We should have noticed
a change by now.

38:58.240 --> 39:00.200
Let's go.

39:01.040 --> 39:03.000
I'm gonna tell them.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.360
- And say goodbye.
- (Elrad) Let us pray.

39:16.040 --> 39:18.400
Sorry, it didn't work.

39:20.680 --> 39:23.880
But it's not too late
to change your mind about leaving.

39:29.400 --> 39:33.280
Great protector, OK. Freyr,
our Lord and Saviour,

39:33.360 --> 39:38.360
accept our frailties and forgive our sins.

39:38.480 --> 39:43.680
We beg you, grant us your mercy
and return the light that gives us life.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.840
Goodbye.

40:07.320 --> 40:10.040
Am I having a stroke?

40:10.160 --> 40:12.360
Blessed be Freyr!

40:12.480 --> 40:16.040
Bow your heads and thank him
for granting our prayers.

40:20.360 --> 40:24.320
I'm pretty sure we didn't do this, sir.
At least, not on our own.

40:27.160 --> 40:30.040
- The Asgard.
- They said they wouldn't help.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.080
OK.vertly.

40:33.160 --> 40:35.800
By starting the process,
we gave them the opportunity

40:35.880 --> 40:38.440
to step in without the Goa'uld knowing?

40:39.480 --> 40:43.040
A way of saving face. Technical loophole.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.400
OK.r not.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.760
Well, we'll never really
know for sure, will we?

42:05.400 --> 42:08.520
