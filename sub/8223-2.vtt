00:00.356 --> 00:02.391
I know it looks like
we have fun on this show,

00:02.392 --> 00:05.303
But we spend weeks
and sometimes months

00:05.303 --> 00:07.872
Planning how to do
our myths safely,

00:07.873 --> 00:12.209
So, please,
don't try this at home.

00:14.646 --> 00:17.548
Narrator: On this episode
of "mythbusters"...

00:17.549 --> 00:18.849
Fire in the hole.

00:18.850 --> 00:21.018
...Adam and jamie
have a blast...

00:21.019 --> 00:24.722
Oh! [ laughs ]
good morning.

00:24.723 --> 00:26.791
...Testing the cinematic clichÃ©

00:26.792 --> 00:28.592
That you can dive underwater...

00:28.593 --> 00:31.462
Building your body
and your mind.

00:31.463 --> 00:35.099
Narrator: ...To survive
an above-water boom.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.167
Oh, yeah.

00:36.168 --> 00:37.435
Wow.

00:37.436 --> 00:40.604
Meanwhile,
kari, grant, and tory...

00:40.605 --> 00:42.807
[ laughter ]

00:42.808 --> 00:45.443
...Let their trigger fingers
do the talking...

00:45.444 --> 00:49.647
Science gets more fun
when I get a bigger gun.

00:49.648 --> 00:52.416
...To find out if you can
bulletproof a car...

00:52.417 --> 00:55.352
I don't know about you guys, but
I'm having an "a-team" moment.

00:55.353 --> 00:58.122
Narrator:
...With nothing but phone books.

00:58.123 --> 01:00.324
Yes, it's alive!

01:02.794 --> 01:04.795
Narrator:
Who are the mythbusters?

01:06.131 --> 01:08.265
Adam savage...
[ laughs ]

01:08.266 --> 01:09.667
...And jamie hyneman.

01:09.668 --> 01:11.702
We're gonna have
an adventure.

01:11.703 --> 01:15.739
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:15.740 --> 01:19.276
Joining them --
grant imahara...

01:19.277 --> 01:20.511
It's lethal, people.

01:20.512 --> 01:21.712
...Kari byron...

01:21.713 --> 01:23.347
But  least we still have
good chemistry.

01:23.348 --> 01:25.616
Narrator:
...And tory belleci.

01:25.617 --> 01:27.051
Crashes and fire --
this is awesome!

01:27.052 --> 01:29.487
They don't just tell
the myths.

01:29.488 --> 01:32.089
They put them to the test.

01:42.501 --> 01:44.001
So, what's the story?

01:44.002 --> 01:46.203
Well, I've been thinking,
wouldn't it be cool

01:46.204 --> 01:48.672
If we were action heroes
in our own movie

01:48.673 --> 01:51.375
And some bad guys were
trying to blow us up,
but we manage to escape?

01:51.376 --> 01:54.345
.Harp play ]
is that a harp
I'm hearing?

01:54.346 --> 01:56.247
Shush.
Here comes a clip.

01:57.949 --> 02:01.852
Narrator:
It's a climactic cinema clichÃ©.

02:01.853 --> 02:03.854
Our heroes are trapped
on a boat,

02:03.855 --> 02:06.123
And a bomb's about to explode.

02:06.124 --> 02:08.258
[ bomb ticking ]

02:08.259 --> 02:12.196
To escape certain death,
they take the plunge...

02:12.197 --> 02:17.401
And, after a huge ka-boom,
resurface completely unharmed.

02:17.402 --> 02:18.903
.Harp play ]

02:18.904 --> 02:21.071
So, you're wondering
whether diving underwater

02:21.072 --> 02:23.207
Could help protect you
from an injury

02:23.208 --> 02:24.742
In the case
of an explosion.

02:24.743 --> 02:26.977
Exactly.

02:26.978 --> 02:29.880
Sounds like a blast.
[ laughs ]

02:29.881 --> 02:31.415
A shock wave is created

02:31.416 --> 02:34.785
When the rapidly expanding gases
inside an explosion

02:34.786 --> 02:37.788
Travel faster
than the speed of sound.

02:37.789 --> 02:41.659
And it's this shock front that
causes a wave of destruction.

02:41.660 --> 02:44.728
But can you avoid
imminent annihilation

02:44.729 --> 02:46.497
By leaping into water?

02:46.498 --> 02:48.132
Well, to find out,

02:48.133 --> 02:50.367
The mythbusters are hunkering
in the bunker

02:50.368 --> 02:52.336
For a proof of concept.

02:52.337 --> 02:54.838
I put together
this bifurcated tank

02:54.839 --> 02:56.407
With a plan to fill
this half with water

02:56.408 --> 03:00.744
And that half with dry-ice fog,
or "air," that we can visualize.

03:00.745 --> 03:03.747
We're gonna put a firecracker
right up here in the center,

03:03.748 --> 03:06.350
Explode it, and, hopefully,
we'll be able to view

03:06.351 --> 03:08.852
That same shock wave
in the two different media

03:08.853 --> 03:11.822
And see if there's a difference
on the high-speed camera.

03:11.823 --> 03:14.892
Narrator: And for that,
jamie's turned to string theory.

03:14.893 --> 03:19.296
These will hang in the water
and move if a shock wave hits.

03:19.297 --> 03:22.833
With the tanks filled
and a firecracker primed,

03:22.834 --> 03:26.170
Stay by for mayhem in miniature.

03:26.171 --> 03:28.005
Everything's perfect.

03:30.575 --> 03:33.143
Ah, I saw
the water move.

03:33.144 --> 03:35.179
Let's see how it looked
on the high-speed.

03:35.180 --> 03:37.781
But a closer look
at the high-speed

03:37.782 --> 03:40.684
Reveals...Not much, actually.

03:40.685 --> 03:43.721
I think we need something bigger
than this firecracker.

03:43.722 --> 03:44.989
I think we do.

03:44.990 --> 03:48.959
Officer smith, I think we need
something a little bigger.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.695
Can you hook us up?

03:51.696 --> 03:55.165
The m-80.

03:55.166 --> 03:57.401
That ought to do it.

03:57.402 --> 04:00.904
With shock waves,
apparently size matters.

04:00.905 --> 04:03.007
Cue the m-80.

04:03.975 --> 04:04.975
Come on, baby.

04:07.045 --> 04:08.946
Wow!                Wow!

04:08.947 --> 04:11.248
[ laughs ]
that was loud.

04:11.249 --> 04:16.053
And, interestingly, I saw
the fog move but not the water.

04:16.053 --> 04:18.422
Well, let's check it out
on the high-speed.

04:18.423 --> 04:20.891
I didn't see much.
Did you?

04:20.892 --> 04:23.794
I'm seeing
the smoke move around.

04:23.795 --> 04:26.397
See that divot there?

04:26.398 --> 04:28.966
Remember, they're looking
for proof

04:28.967 --> 04:31.935
That a shock wave behaves
differently in water to air.

04:31.936 --> 04:34.905
But the shock waves aren't
showing up on the close-up.

04:36.308 --> 04:39.977
So, for a bigger boom,
it's back to officer smith.

04:39.978 --> 04:41.445
The m-1000.

04:41.446 --> 04:43.213
Ah.

04:43.214 --> 04:45.916
More?
About 100 times more.

04:45.917 --> 04:48.018
[ laughs ]

04:48.019 --> 04:51.488
Hopefully, that should tie up
jamie's loose threads.

04:51.489 --> 04:54.158
Oh, it's getting close.

04:54.159 --> 04:56.760
Here it comes.

04:56.761 --> 05:00.197
Whoa.
[ laughs ]

05:00.198 --> 05:02.666
I think we're going
to have seen something.

05:02.667 --> 05:05.769
I think so.
Oh, did that blow the door open?

05:05.770 --> 05:07.771
[ chuckles ]

05:07.772 --> 05:10.607
There's water
on the ceiling.

05:10.608 --> 05:12.242
That's always
a good sign.

05:12.243 --> 05:14.912
Yeah.

05:14.913 --> 05:17.514
A good sign, but once again,

05:17.515 --> 05:20.017
The high-speed replay
has the same problem.

05:20.018 --> 05:22.386
There's no clear shot
of the shock wave.

05:22.387 --> 05:24.722
It's reacting,

05:24.723 --> 05:27.458
But they seem to be reacting
differently somehow.

05:27.459 --> 05:30.194
Well, they're not telling us
what we want to see.

05:30.195 --> 05:32.196
I think we're gonna have
to concoct a different test

05:32.197 --> 05:34.331
If we're gonna learn whether
or not there's a difference

05:34.332 --> 05:36.767
Between a shock wave
in the water and a
shock wave in the air.

05:36.768 --> 05:38.635
I think you're right.
We're done here.
Okay.

05:42.607 --> 05:45.909
[ laughs ] every day
is the 4th of July.

05:49.981 --> 05:54.885
Next up, the team calls
for directwry assistance.

05:54.886 --> 05:57.588
So, "phonebook freedom" --
what is this one all about?

05:57.589 --> 05:59.857
Okay, so, this myth
comes from a spy tv show.

05:59.858 --> 06:02.459
And they say that if you're
desperate and penniless,

06:02.460 --> 06:04.561
There is an easy way to make
your vehicle bulletproof.

06:04.562 --> 06:07.197
Using phone books?
That's right.

06:07.198 --> 06:09.366
If you put the phone books
in the panels of your car,

06:09.367 --> 06:11.735
You can actually stop
non-armor-piercing rounds
easily.

06:11.736 --> 06:13.036
Kari: Okay, I could see
how that could work.

06:13.037 --> 06:14.338
The bullet hits the car door.

06:14.339 --> 06:16.673
It hits the metal first,
absorbs most of the energy,

06:16.674 --> 06:18.909
And the rest gets absorbed
by the phone books.

06:18.910 --> 06:20.077
It could work.
Wow.

06:20.078 --> 06:22.446
Sounds like they
really phoned this ove in.

06:22.447 --> 06:24.648
[ laughs ]

06:24.649 --> 06:27.885
Narrator:
Well, according to this
small-screen spy scene,

06:27.886 --> 06:30.421
You can bulletproof by numbers.

06:30.422 --> 06:33.257
Just one layer of phone books
inside the doors,

06:33.258 --> 06:35.893
And it's a free ride
to safety.

06:35.894 --> 06:37.528
Okay, this one should be
pretty simple.

06:37.529 --> 06:39.963
We get a bunch of car doors,
a bunch of phone books,

06:39.964 --> 06:41.231
Shoot at them,
see if they're bulletproof.

06:41.232 --> 06:42.599
Yeah,
that's pretty much it.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.901
But just to be thorough,

06:43.902 --> 06:46.003
We should fire a bunch
of different types of guns,

06:46.004 --> 06:49.072
'cause in the real world,
you never know what you're
gonna be up against.

06:49.073 --> 06:50.641
All right, well,
I think our first trip

06:50.642 --> 06:52.543
Should be the junkyard,
and we'll get some doors.

06:52.544 --> 06:55.746
Narrator: They'll test this myth
by the book.

06:55.747 --> 06:59.216
So, first thing's first --
they need something to stuff.

06:59.217 --> 07:02.152
Okay, my way's not working.

07:04.456 --> 07:06.824
So, we got four doors
off of this car.

07:06.825 --> 07:09.927
That's pretty much all we need
to take down to the range.

07:09.928 --> 07:11.395
They're already hollowed out,

07:11.396 --> 07:13.263
So we can just stick
the phone books in there.

07:13.264 --> 07:14.465
This should be a piece of cake.

07:16.835 --> 07:19.503
Narrator: Back at the shop,
the cake comes together

07:19.504 --> 07:21.305
In what has to be

07:21.306 --> 07:24.875
The most low-tech build
in "mythbusters" history.

07:24.876 --> 07:27.077
Wait, round hole,
square peg, what?

07:27.078 --> 07:29.780
This doesn't seem to fit.

07:29.781 --> 07:33.050
And with one layer of phone
books wedged inside the doors,

07:33.051 --> 07:34.651
They head
for the shooting range...

07:34.652 --> 07:36.353
You guys ready
to start shooting?

07:36.354 --> 07:38.288
...To hit the books.

07:38.289 --> 07:39.923
For this experiment,
we have car doors

07:39.924 --> 07:41.658
Lined with a single layer
of phone books,

07:41.659 --> 07:44.127
Which, according to the myth, is
all it took to stop a bullet.

07:44.128 --> 07:46.930
And on this side,
we've painted a target.

07:46.931 --> 07:49.967
Then we'll set up the doors
at the end of the firing range,

07:49.968 --> 07:51.969
And we'll start shooting at them
with a variety of guns

07:51.970 --> 07:54.538
From 30 feet away.

07:54.539 --> 07:57.007
We'll be firing
a 9mm handgun,

07:57.008 --> 08:01.245
A .357 magnum,
a .45-caliber,

08:01.246 --> 08:04.748
And, finally,
a 12 gauge shotgun.

08:05.283 --> 08:08.018
Narrator: Right, and before
they take a shot at the myth,

08:08.019 --> 08:09.686
How about a prediction?

08:09.687 --> 08:11.989
Kari: We're starting out
with the 9mm handgun.

08:11.990 --> 08:14.558
I'm thinking
2 1/2 inches of phone book,

08:14.559 --> 08:17.127
1/8 inch on the outside of
the car door of sheet metal --

08:17.128 --> 08:20.597
Yeah, we could be bulletproof
right now.

08:20.598 --> 08:21.932
All right, this is the 9mm,

08:21.933 --> 08:23.734
The smallest round
in our arsenal.

08:23.735 --> 08:25.035
Here we go.

08:27.171 --> 08:28.639
Kari: Whoo.
Grant: Good shot.

08:28.640 --> 08:32.009
Narrator: There's an entry hole
but no exit for the 9mm...

08:32.010 --> 08:33.076
Kari: Look at that.

08:33.077 --> 08:34.778
No way.
2 inches in.

08:34.779 --> 08:37.414
Narrator: ...Meaning that's one
for the books.

08:37.414 --> 08:40.583
But can they get the same result
with gun number two?

08:40.585 --> 08:46.123
Firing at 1,450 feet per second,
it's the .357 magnum.

08:48.726 --> 08:50.327
Nice shot, tex.

08:50.328 --> 08:53.497
A clean strike,
but what's the verdict?

08:53.498 --> 08:54.665
No way.

08:54.666 --> 08:56.667
So, it didn't make it
all the way through.

08:56.668 --> 09:00.270
That means the phone book
actually made this bulletproof.

09:00.271 --> 09:02.372
Grant: The phone book's
blocked the 9mm.

09:02.373 --> 09:04.608
They blocked the .357 magnum.

09:04.609 --> 09:07.511
But I've got one of these.
It's a .45-caliber.

09:07.512 --> 09:11.014
If this doesn't make it through,
I'll be really surprised.

09:11.015 --> 09:12.082
Going hot.

09:15.186 --> 09:17.721
Narrator: The bullet punched
through the front panel.

09:17.722 --> 09:19.423
Grant: Yeah.
But the phone book?

09:19.424 --> 09:21.692
No way.
But it stopped it.

09:21.693 --> 09:23.994
Grant:
That's astounding.

09:23.995 --> 09:26.363
This myth
is looking really good.

09:26.364 --> 09:29.700
Narrator:
That's 3-0 to the phone books.

09:29.701 --> 09:31.835
The handgun rounds
didn't penetrate,

09:31.836 --> 09:35.038
But next, it's
the toughest round so far --

09:35.039 --> 09:37.908
The 12 gauge shotgun's
deer slug.

09:39.243 --> 09:41.612
Nice.

09:41.613 --> 09:43.180
Tory's aim is dead on,

09:43.181 --> 09:45.749
Resulting in the first
phone-book casualty.

09:46.985 --> 09:50.253
So, the 12 gauge deer slug
went right through the door.

09:50.254 --> 09:53.256
It went through the front panel,
the steel reinforcement,

09:53.257 --> 09:55.092
The phone book,
and the inside panel.

09:55.093 --> 09:57.194
Now, that is an intense shot.

09:57.195 --> 09:58.996
Narrator: Intense is right.

09:58.997 --> 10:01.765
With the shotgun
firing a 385-grain slug

10:01.766 --> 10:04.301
At 1,850 feet per second,

10:04.302 --> 10:08.739
The phone book at last
met its match.

10:08.740 --> 10:11.541
But now
it's gonna meet its maker,

10:11.542 --> 10:15.946
'cause grant's packing
an m14 assault rifle.

10:15.947 --> 10:18.115
Okay, you guys ready?

10:21.519 --> 10:24.521
Oh, look
at that bull's-eye.

10:24.522 --> 10:26.723
Tory:
Well, no surprise

10:26.724 --> 10:28.258
That the bullet went
right through thdoor.

10:28.259 --> 10:29.693
Look at that -- it didn't
even slow down.

10:29.694 --> 10:31.995
Grant: Oh, more like it tore
through the door.

10:31.996 --> 10:33.697
Narrator:
With a muzzle velocity

10:33.698 --> 10:36.900
1,000 feet per second
faster than the shotgun,

10:36.901 --> 10:39.870
It's no surprise that this round
also sailed clean through.

10:39.871 --> 10:42.305
But where does that
leave the myth?

10:42.306 --> 10:44.941
So, this myth is about
non-armor-piercing rounds

10:44.942 --> 10:46.343
Being stopped by car doors

10:46.344 --> 10:48.378
Filled with phone books
like these.

10:48.379 --> 10:49.880
This is true of the 9mm,

10:49.881 --> 10:52.382
The .357 magnum,
and the .45-caliber --

10:52.383 --> 10:53.583
All handguns.

10:53.584 --> 10:55.886
Once you get anything larger
than a handgun,

10:55.887 --> 10:57.554
The bullets go right through.

10:57.555 --> 11:01.024
So this myth could be busted
right here, right now.

11:01.025 --> 11:02.559
Or is it?

11:02.560 --> 11:05.595
Narrator: Coming up next in
the "dive to survive" saga...

11:05.596 --> 11:08.899
Oh! [ laughs ]

11:08.900 --> 11:10.667
Good morning.

11:10.668 --> 11:13.804
...The mythbusters make boom
for improvement.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:22.801 --> 11:24.249
Narrator: In this movie myth,

11:24.249 --> 11:29.085
Our heroes take cover underwater
to escape injury from a bomb.

11:29.455 --> 11:32.491
But could taking a dive
save your life?

11:32.492 --> 11:35.994
It's time to up the ante

11:35.995 --> 11:38.530
At the mythbusters' home
away from home.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.932
A good day to blow
some crap up, huh?

11:40.933 --> 11:42.401
You bet.

11:42.402 --> 11:45.537
Blow crap up they will,
but this time,

11:45.538 --> 11:47.973
Instead of trying
to visualize the shock wave,

11:47.974 --> 11:49.975
They'll measure it.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.676
Adam: This plumbing equipment
here is a matrix

11:51.677 --> 11:53.545
For holding together
our key piece

11:53.546 --> 11:54.913
Of detection equipment
in this myth,

11:54.914 --> 11:58.383
And that is this --
an oseco rupture disk,

11:58.384 --> 12:00.352
Basically a calibrated piece
of aluminum foil.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.187
When this is properly held
in the plumbing

12:02.188 --> 12:04.990
And it finds itself
in an environment

12:04.991 --> 12:09.127
Over 13 pounds per square inch
of pressure, it will...Burst,

12:09.128 --> 12:12.164
Telling you that if you were
standing where this disk was,

12:12.165 --> 12:15.267
You'd encounter physical injury.

12:15.268 --> 12:18.170
Narrator: And our regular
explosives expert, j.D.,

12:18.171 --> 12:20.806
Has the c-4 to test them.

12:20.807 --> 12:23.041
That may blow up,
but it --

12:23.042 --> 12:25.944
J.D.,
it's not very pretty.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.112
Got to make it round.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.014
Make it more like
the cartoons.
Yeah.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.949
I have no doubt in my mind

12:30.950 --> 12:33.685
You're gonna get
that road runner this time.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.454
Then it's over to adam

12:35.455 --> 12:38.190
To explain exactly
how this all fits together.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.725
We're going to ignite
this calibrated block of c-4,

12:40.726 --> 12:42.761
And it will generate
a pressure wave --

12:42.762 --> 12:44.596
Quite a dangerous
pressure wave --

12:44.597 --> 12:46.331
That will burst some

12:46.332 --> 12:49.668
But not all of the burst disks
in this line.

12:49.669 --> 12:52.370
Let's say it bursts all of them
up to here and none after that.

12:52.371 --> 12:55.574
That tells me that this point
is the furthest point

12:55.575 --> 12:57.576
At which
that explosive generates

12:57.577 --> 13:00.579
A dangerous, injurious amount
of pressure.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.013
Are you ready?

13:02.014 --> 13:03.348
All right, j.D.,
go ahead and light it.

13:03.349 --> 13:08.787
This is calculating
injurious distance of c-4.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.522
We're gonna feel this one.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.224
Yeah, I think so.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.264
[ laughs ]
wow, that was a rush.

13:19.265 --> 13:21.733
That'll wake you up
in the morning.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.568
Let's go check them out.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.806
Narrator: Great --
one acme explosion down,

13:27.807 --> 13:29.441
And the mythbusters have

13:29.442 --> 13:32.611
The dangerous-distance data
they need.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.346
All the way up to here.

13:34.347 --> 13:37.582
10 feet is it, then.
That's our danger zone.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.618
Our danger zone --
all right, 10 feet.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.420
Now it's time
for phase two.

13:43.689 --> 13:45.223
Jamie:
What we want to know

13:45.224 --> 13:49.594
Is how well an explosion
that occurs in the air

13:49.595 --> 13:52.531
Can make the transition
into the water

13:52.532 --> 13:55.333
And how potentially dangerous
that would be.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.636
Narrator: And to find out,
the guys rejig their rig...

13:57.637 --> 13:58.670
Blah!

13:58.671 --> 14:00.138
...So that for blast two,

14:00.139 --> 14:02.174
It can simultaneously monitor
the effect

14:02.175 --> 14:05.243
Of the shock wave
in air and in water.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.379
Adam:
So, what's this test about?

14:07.380 --> 14:08.613
It's actually pretty simple --

14:08.614 --> 14:12.150
One burst disk in air,
one burst disk in water.

14:12.151 --> 14:14.152
If there's any truth
to this myth,

14:14.153 --> 14:16.821
What we should see
when we set off that explosive

14:16.822 --> 14:20.458
Is that this burst disk will
blow and this one will not.

14:20.459 --> 14:22.527
Okay, take it up.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.763
Narrator: Well, it's time to put
that theory to the test

14:24.764 --> 14:27.432
With the same amount of c-4

14:27.433 --> 14:29.935
10 feet away
from the two pressure disks.

14:29.936 --> 14:32.637
Go for it, j.D.
Light it up.

14:32.638 --> 14:34.573
There it goes.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.840
I don't know about you,

14:35.841 --> 14:37.909
But I'm predicting that
there will be a difference.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.544
I think so.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.079
I'm just thinking
about the shock wave.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.447
That's a --

14:42.448 --> 14:44.316
This is invigorating.

14:50.256 --> 14:51.790
Oh!
Oh!

14:54.026 --> 14:55.060
Oh! Ohh.

14:55.061 --> 14:58.597
[ laughs ]
good morning.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.432
Narrator:
Yep, that should do it.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.802
Now to find out
how the burst disks compare.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.704
[ laughs ]

15:08.574 --> 15:10.141
Two blown burst disks.

15:10.142 --> 15:14.179
Two intact burst disks.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.881
Nice.
That's what I call a result.

15:16.882 --> 15:19.584
There might be something
to this after all.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.988
Narrator:
And a look at the high-speed
confirms jamie's suspicions.

15:22.989 --> 15:25.523
This high-speed shot
tells the whole story.

15:25.524 --> 15:26.891
The rupture disk in the open air

15:26.892 --> 15:29.694
Is burst immediately
and clean through,

15:29.695 --> 15:31.496
As opposed to the one
in the water,

15:31.497 --> 15:32.697
Which is affected,

15:32.698 --> 15:35.233
But only with a ripple
and an instant later.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.868
Now, what this tells us is

15:36.869 --> 15:40.505
That the water is actually
diminishing the shock wave.

15:40.506 --> 15:44.743
It's slowing it down and making
it much less powerful.

15:44.744 --> 15:47.045
Narrator:
It's looking good for the myth.

15:47.046 --> 15:49.247
The water does appear
to dampen the shock wave

15:49.248 --> 15:51.283
And reduce the risk of injury.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.586
But they won't know for sure
until they go full scale.

15:54.587 --> 15:55.887
So, based on this test,

15:55.888 --> 15:58.223
I figure we should take
tanks of water out

15:58.224 --> 16:00.458
Whenever we do tests
with explosives --

16:00.459 --> 16:02.027
You know, get into the tanks.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.962
Adam:
That's a great idea.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.563
I know.
That one was cool.

16:05.564 --> 16:08.066
And if you want to see
what I'm talking about,

16:08.067 --> 16:12.570
Go to discovery.Com/mythbusters
and check it out.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.711
Narrator: When you're making
a quick getaway

16:19.712 --> 16:21.746
From gun-toting bad guys,

16:21.747 --> 16:25.417
A little extra protection
goes a long way.

16:25.418 --> 16:28.920
But so far in this
budget bulletproofing saga...

16:28.921 --> 16:30.789
Nice shot, tex.

16:30.790 --> 16:35.527
...The phone numbers
just don't add up.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.063
The myth is that a single layer
of phone books,

16:38.064 --> 16:39.431
When added to a car door,

16:39.432 --> 16:41.866
Will make an impenetrable
barrier to bullets.

16:41.867 --> 16:43.268
This is busted.

16:43.269 --> 16:46.971
Both our deer slug and our
m14 round went clean through.

16:50.142 --> 16:53.144
And though that may be true for
a single layer of phone books,

16:53.145 --> 16:55.613
How many phone books deep
are we gonna have to get

16:55.614 --> 16:58.516
To make our car bulletproof
for the high-powered ammunition?

17:00.186 --> 17:02.420
Ugh!
So, we're gonna carry on.

17:02.421 --> 17:04.255
It's obvious that we need
more phone books.

17:04.256 --> 17:06.023
So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna take

17:06.025 --> 17:07.826
The same doors
stuffed with the phone book

17:07.827 --> 17:10.662
And add more phone books --
10, to be exact --

17:10.663 --> 17:13.897
And see if that's enough
to make our cars bulletproof

17:13.898 --> 17:16.267
Against these
higher-powered weapons.

17:16.268 --> 17:19.938
Narrator: The mythical one layer
of phone books is busted,

17:19.939 --> 17:23.208
But by how much?

17:23.209 --> 17:25.377
Okay, this is deer slug

17:25.377 --> 17:28.480
Into 10 phone books
behind the car door.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.217
Nice shot.
Ah.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.318
Once again, the slug

17:33.319 --> 17:36.421
Blew through
the door/phone book combo.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.757
But how many more books
did it take to stop it?

17:38.758 --> 17:41.126
Just one --
into the auto section.

17:41.127 --> 17:43.895
Huh, that's ironic.
So, we got to page 151.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.530
So it looks
like two phone books

17:45.531 --> 17:47.565
Is all you would need
to stop a deer slug.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.268
Narrator: Not bad, but there's
still the top gun to go.

17:50.269 --> 17:52.370
I think this is
gonna cut right through.

17:55.141 --> 17:56.941
Narrator:
Well, hold the phone,

17:56.942 --> 17:59.210
'cause it looks like tory
may have been wrong.

17:59.211 --> 18:01.379
There it is, still warm.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.816
And we got almost
to the backside

18:04.817 --> 18:06.351
Of the first phone book.

18:06.352 --> 18:08.253
Narrator: Plus the one nestled
inside the door,

18:08.254 --> 18:12.223
That's still only two phone
books to stop an m14 bullet.

18:12.224 --> 18:15.293
I thought it would easily have
gone through half that stack.

18:15.294 --> 18:17.061
I thought it was gonna go
through the whole stack.

18:17.062 --> 18:19.597
I mean, that's it --
two layers of phone books,

18:19.598 --> 18:22.467
And you could turn your car
into a bulletproof vehicle.

18:22.468 --> 18:23.468
Yeah!

18:23.469 --> 18:25.603
After a hard day's shooting,

18:25.604 --> 18:28.273
The myth is busted,
but only just.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.875
And that's giving
the mythbusters

18:30.876 --> 18:32.444
Something to think about.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.313
So, the idea that you can
bulletproof a car door

18:35.314 --> 18:37.682
With one phone book --
totally busted.

18:37.683 --> 18:39.551
Yes, but I don't think
we can leave it there.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.186
Go on.

18:41.187 --> 18:43.588
I think since we were able
to stop all the bullets

18:43.589 --> 18:45.156
Using two phone books
in the doors,

18:45.157 --> 18:47.225
This whole idea of
a bulletproof car using
phone books is possible.

18:47.226 --> 18:49.127
I say we try
to build one.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.762
A whole car?
Yeah.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.797
Completely bulletproof?
Yep.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.132
I love it.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.533
Okay, but I see
there are two problems.

18:55.534 --> 18:58.269
First, we've established
that it takes two phone books

18:58.270 --> 19:00.338
To armor a door,
but what about the windows?

19:00.339 --> 19:03.141
And second, we may need
so many phone books

19:03.142 --> 19:04.742
That the car
is too heavy to drive.

19:04.743 --> 19:06.911
So we find out how many
phone books it takes to
bulletproof a window,

19:06.912 --> 19:09.047
We do a little math,

19:09.048 --> 19:10.915
And we find out, if you load
this thing up with phone books,

19:10.916 --> 19:12.650
Will it still drive?

19:12.651 --> 19:15.019
All right, and then we build
a bulletproof car.

19:15.020 --> 19:17.322
Narrator:
Tory's all fired up,

19:17.323 --> 19:19.157
But before any overhauling,

19:19.158 --> 19:21.693
Theye looking
into those windows.

19:21.694 --> 19:24.362
Just how many phone books
will it take

19:24.363 --> 19:27.565
To make them stop a slug?

19:27.566 --> 19:30.502
To find out, kari and tory
position 10 phone books

19:30.503 --> 19:32.270
Behind the glass

19:32.271 --> 19:35.607
And take aim
with the mighty m14.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.642
3...2...1.

19:40.045 --> 19:42.280
It looks like it went
through three phone books.

19:42.281 --> 19:45.350
Let's go take a look.
Oh, yeah.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.318
Three phone books is right.

19:47.319 --> 19:49.521
There it is. Ta-da.
There it is.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.122
But there's a problem.

19:51.123 --> 19:54.425
Three phone books deep
inside the car

19:54.426 --> 19:56.995
Is pretty much gonna crowd
the driver out.

19:56.996 --> 19:59.364
Right -- there's not much point
in bulletproofing

19:59.365 --> 20:01.266
If the driver won't fit.

20:01.267 --> 20:04.702
So to give him some room,
they try a sandwich formation --

20:04.703 --> 20:08.339
Two on the outside
and one on the inside.

20:09.608 --> 20:12.477
In 3...2...1.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.047
But, unfortunately...

20:16.048 --> 20:18.216
It blasted out
the backside.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.052
...The bullet makes a meal
of the sandwich.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.487
But that's crazy.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.022
I mean, it's the same amount
of material

20:24.023 --> 20:25.356
That it's passing through.

20:25.357 --> 20:27.625
It's three phone books
and a pane of glass.

20:27.626 --> 20:31.396
Well, I guess that means that
when the bullet hits the window,

20:31.397 --> 20:32.797
Which is a hard surface,

20:32.798 --> 20:35.266
It deforms and then just gets
absorbed into the back three.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.168
And that's key.

20:37.169 --> 20:39.571
When the bullet hits
a rigid surface,

20:39.572 --> 20:41.239
Like metal or glass, first,

20:41.240 --> 20:43.708
It expends a large part
of its energy.

20:43.709 --> 20:47.211
But when the bullet hits
the flexible phone books first,

20:47.212 --> 20:48.746
Less energy is expended,

20:48.747 --> 20:51.449
And it can continue
along its trajectory.

20:51.450 --> 20:54.719
So, what they need to know now

20:54.720 --> 20:57.255
Is how many phone books
in front of the glass

20:57.256 --> 20:58.523
Will stop the slug.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.491
Gun's hot.

21:00.492 --> 21:02.660
In 3...2...1.

21:03.829 --> 21:05.863
Did that go
all the way through?

21:05.864 --> 21:07.865
I sure hope not.

21:07.866 --> 21:10.935
Narrator:
Well, actually, the bullet made
it through 4 1/2 phone books --

21:10.936 --> 21:14.572
More than double the phone books
needed for the doors.

21:14.573 --> 21:16.874
Kari: Do you know how heavy
it's gonna be to cover

21:16.875 --> 21:20.078
Every single window surface
with five phone books?

21:20.079 --> 21:22.380
That's better
than 10 phone books.

21:22.381 --> 21:23.848
Okay, bright-side boy.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.720
After the break,
adam and jamie find out...

21:30.723 --> 21:32.924
Wow! That was a lot.

21:32.925 --> 21:37.629
...If it really is better
down where it's wetter.

21:44.957 --> 21:48.803
Narrator: With a bomb about
to blow and no escape but down,

21:49.081 --> 21:52.049
Would taking a plunge
protect you from the blast?

21:52.458 --> 21:55.227
Adam and jamie
are putting that to the test.

21:57.497 --> 21:59.264
Good morning.

21:59.265 --> 22:01.900
Jamie:
We've just seen that there does
appear to be an advantage

22:01.901 --> 22:03.569
To being submerged
when a bomb goes off.

22:03.570 --> 22:06.838
The rupture disk that was
under the water was intact.

22:06.839 --> 22:09.441
The one that was in the air
was ruptured.

22:09.442 --> 22:11.310
Obviously,
we used a small tank, though,

22:11.311 --> 22:14.079
And the scale of the tank
and the nature of tank

22:14.080 --> 22:15.914
Could've affected our results.

22:15.915 --> 22:17.449
So they're not definitive.

22:17.450 --> 22:19.785
What we need to do now
is go full scale

22:19.786 --> 22:21.753
In an open body of water.

22:21.754 --> 22:24.056
And we're creating
an aquatic rig

22:24.057 --> 22:26.558
That will give us
the measurements we need,

22:26.559 --> 22:28.660
Both above and below water.

22:28.661 --> 22:31.263
Narrator: This is a complicated
rig with lots of parts...

22:31.264 --> 22:34.199
Lots of pieces to cut.

22:34.200 --> 22:38.303
Narrator: ...Some that float,
and some that don't.

22:38.304 --> 22:39.771
Yeah.

22:39.772 --> 22:42.874
I know it doesn't look
like much, but trust me,

22:42.875 --> 22:44.509
Once this stuff
all goes together,

22:44.510 --> 22:46.778
You will see that there is
a method to the madness.

22:46.779 --> 22:48.614
You don't have
to take my word for it --

22:48.615 --> 22:50.482
Just probably
one more commercial break,

22:50.483 --> 22:51.750
And you'll get to see it all.

22:51.751 --> 22:52.951
Narrator: Well, actually,

22:52.952 --> 22:54.853
You don't even have
to wait that long.

22:54.854 --> 22:56.154
I think
that ought to do it.

22:56.155 --> 22:58.457
Let's go scuba diving
and blowing some stuff up.

22:58.458 --> 22:59.658
All right.

22:59.659 --> 23:03.428
With the rig flat-packed,
it's off to location.

23:03.429 --> 23:04.830
Adam: It's a lovely lake,
isn't it?

23:04.831 --> 23:06.231
In fact,
it's not actually a lake.

23:06.232 --> 23:09.001
It's a man-made pit --
pit 232, to be exact,

23:09.002 --> 23:11.603
Here at rancho arroyo seco.

23:11.604 --> 23:14.439
And the fact that it has
no wildlife at all living in it

23:14.440 --> 23:16.775
Makes it ideal for what?

23:16.776 --> 23:18.777
Yes, blowing stuff up.

23:18.778 --> 23:22.214
[ laughs ]
it's gonna be a good day.

23:22.215 --> 23:24.816
Narrator: But before they start
blowing anything up,

23:24.817 --> 23:26.785
They've got to get
their rig in position

23:26.786 --> 23:29.087
And make sure it floats.

23:29.088 --> 23:30.689
It's a dock.

23:30.690 --> 23:34.826
The other one
will be just peachy.

23:34.827 --> 23:36.428
So, how are we
gonna test the myth

23:36.429 --> 23:38.997
That jumping in the water can
protect you from an explosion

23:38.998 --> 23:40.365
In full scale?

23:40.366 --> 23:43.302
Well, it all starts
with a body of water.

23:43.303 --> 23:45.570
And continues
with this platform,

23:45.571 --> 23:48.674
Which soon will have
various types of explosives

23:48.675 --> 23:50.842
Placed right
where I'm sitting.

23:50.843 --> 23:53.712
For measurement, we're using
oseco rupture disks,

23:53.713 --> 23:56.148
And we're mounting them
in these things.

23:56.149 --> 23:58.250
And they're calibrated
for 13 p.S.I.,

23:58.251 --> 24:00.686
Which is our threshold
for human injury.

24:00.687 --> 24:04.589
We'll be deploying
our rupture-disk masts

24:04.590 --> 24:10.095
At 5, 10, 20, and 50 feet away
from the explosions.

24:10.096 --> 24:13.532
We're gonna be mounting
these things like so

24:13.533 --> 24:15.233
On our floating masts

24:15.234 --> 24:18.236
At 5 feet above water...

24:18.237 --> 24:21.106
5 feet under the water...

24:21.107 --> 24:23.909
And 10 feet
under the water.

24:23.910 --> 24:25.410
And if the myth is true,

24:25.411 --> 24:26.878
If jumping in the water

24:26.879 --> 24:29.448
Really can protect you
from an explosion,

24:29.449 --> 24:31.783
We should find that
one of our masts

24:31.784 --> 24:33.352
Has its in-air disk burst

24:33.353 --> 24:36.455
But the ones underwater intact.

24:36.456 --> 24:39.291
Narrator:
And for an in-depth result,

24:39.292 --> 24:40.792
They do three tests

24:40.793 --> 24:43.829
With 50 pounds
of three different explosives,

24:43.830 --> 24:46.565
Starting with gasoline.

24:46.566 --> 24:48.633
These are the buttons --
"arm" and "fire."

24:48.634 --> 24:50.602
When I push these,
50 pounds of gasoline

24:50.603 --> 24:52.704
On that tripod behind me
are gonna go boom.

24:52.705 --> 24:54.439
Will it demonstrate
an improvement

24:54.440 --> 24:56.675
To being underwater
as opposed to above water?

24:56.676 --> 24:58.410
I don't know.

24:58.411 --> 25:00.946
Narrator: Well, there's
only one way to find out.

25:00.947 --> 25:02.514
You ready?

25:02.515 --> 25:04.049
I'm ready.
All right.

25:04.050 --> 25:06.451
I've had my coffee --
good to blow.

25:06.452 --> 25:07.953
[ laughs ]

25:07.954 --> 25:11.256
With the gas bobbing away
on the surface of the lake,

25:11.257 --> 25:13.158
Jamie utters
those familiar words.

25:13.159 --> 25:17.028
Fire in the hole.
Fire in the hole.

25:17.029 --> 25:19.164
Fire in the hole.

25:19.165 --> 25:22.000
And adam's on the button.

25:22.001 --> 25:24.403
3...2...1.

25:25.571 --> 25:29.274
Wow! That was a lot.

25:29.275 --> 25:30.475
It was.

25:30.476 --> 25:33.111
[ laughs ]

25:33.112 --> 25:37.249
All of our little holders
are still in place.

25:37.250 --> 25:40.085
But the platform
is gone.

25:40.086 --> 25:42.554
The pressure wave
from the gasoline

25:42.555 --> 25:45.357
May have destroyed
the floating platform,

25:45.358 --> 25:48.760
But, more importantly,
how did the burst disks fare?

25:50.430 --> 25:51.830
Above and below the water

25:51.831 --> 25:54.900
At 50 feet, 20 feet,
and 10 feet,

25:54.901 --> 25:56.268
They're all intact.

25:56.269 --> 25:57.769
No ruptures.

25:57.770 --> 26:02.441
The burst disks
are intact.

26:02.442 --> 26:05.710
At the 5-foot mast
above water,

26:05.711 --> 26:07.646
That perfect record
is broken.

26:07.647 --> 26:11.616
5 feet away --
[ chuckles ]

26:11.617 --> 26:13.485
Clean through.

26:13.486 --> 26:15.687
But underwater,
it's a different story.

26:15.688 --> 26:20.292
The burst disks
are totally intact.

26:20.293 --> 26:21.927
Interesting.

26:21.928 --> 26:24.162
I thought so.

26:24.163 --> 26:25.831
It's looking good
for the myth.

26:25.832 --> 26:28.667
At 5 feet,
the above-water disk burst,

26:28.668 --> 26:32.037
But the ones below the surface
remained intact.

26:32.038 --> 26:33.472
The gasoline explosion

26:33.473 --> 26:36.374
Didn't really create much
of a pressure wave.

26:36.375 --> 26:38.076
It created a nice big fireball.

26:38.077 --> 26:41.780
And I have to say
that if I was near one of those,

26:41.781 --> 26:44.816
I'd want to get underwater
'cause I wouldn't get burned.

26:44.817 --> 26:48.787
Narrator: Indeed, but one shock
wave does not a result make.

26:48.788 --> 26:52.858
So the mythbusters
aren't gonna leave it there.

26:52.859 --> 26:54.793
[ high-pitched voice ] coming up
next on "mythbusters,"

26:54.794 --> 26:58.230
Can you really bulletproof
a car using phone books?

26:58.231 --> 26:59.831
Oh, my god!

27:03.782 --> 27:06.251
Don't try anything you see
on this show at home.

27:06.252 --> 27:07.919
We're what you call
experts.

27:14.362 --> 27:16.297
Narrator:
The team has their data

27:16.298 --> 27:18.265
For the automobile
phone-book armor.

27:18.266 --> 27:22.670
Two books behind a door
and five in front of a window

27:22.671 --> 27:23.938
Will bulletproof a car.

27:23.939 --> 27:25.506
Look, diamonds.

27:25.507 --> 27:29.410
Narrator: So they're about
to throw the books at this.

27:29.411 --> 27:31.745
Dude, nice car.
Thanks.

27:31.746 --> 27:34.415
But there's a problem.
What?

27:34.416 --> 27:37.351
Well, that car's carrying
capacity is 1,800 pounds.

27:37.352 --> 27:40.588
Now, to totally bulletproof it,
we'd need over 900 phone books,

27:40.589 --> 27:43.324
Which will weigh
more than 4,000 pounds.

27:43.325 --> 27:44.525
So, in other words,
what you're saying

27:44.526 --> 27:47.094
Is it would be so heavy,
it wouldn't be able to move.

27:47.095 --> 27:49.897
Exactly -- the maximum number
of phone books we can use

27:49.898 --> 27:53.133
And still have the car
be drivable is 400.

27:53.134 --> 27:54.235
Okay, well,
all is not lost.

27:54.236 --> 27:55.569
Let's just be strategic
about this.

27:55.570 --> 27:56.904
Let's strip out
all the extra weight

27:56.905 --> 27:59.039
And then just bulletproof
to priority.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.909
I mean, we'll do it around
the driver or the engine block,

28:01.910 --> 28:04.712
And maybe the passengers
in the back could just duck.

28:04.713 --> 28:07.615
All right, sounds like we got
our work cut out for us.

28:07.616 --> 28:10.351
Well, if we're looking
to save weight,

28:10.352 --> 28:11.585
We can get rid
of the seat.

28:11.586 --> 28:13.320
Yeah, that should buy us
some phone books.

28:13.321 --> 28:15.155
Narrator: Clearly,
bulletproofing this car

28:15.156 --> 28:17.891
Is all about how you throw
your weight around.

28:17.892 --> 28:19.560
We're on a roll now.

28:19.561 --> 28:23.197
Kari: So, obviously, you're not
gonna bulletproof your car

28:23.198 --> 28:25.165
With phone books
on the run.

28:25.166 --> 28:26.967
So, okay,
maybe this is the scenario.

28:26.968 --> 28:29.036
The three heroes
are trapped in a warehouse,

28:29.037 --> 28:30.537
It's surrounded by crazy gunmen,

28:30.538 --> 28:33.207
And there just happens to be a
car and some phone books there.

28:33.208 --> 28:35.776
So you bulletproof the car,
make your getaway to freedom.

28:35.777 --> 28:38.579
Narrator: And that getaway
will be far too dangerous

28:38.580 --> 28:41.515
For a real wheelman.

28:41.516 --> 28:43.717
So it's over
to r.C. Whiz grant.

28:43.718 --> 28:45.519
Now, normally,
with the radio-control system,

28:45.520 --> 28:47.755
You have something called
a servo, which is a small motor.

28:47.756 --> 28:49.990
But we're talking
about a full-size car

28:49.991 --> 28:52.826
That's potentially loaded
with a lot of weight.

28:52.827 --> 28:56.764
This isn't gonna cut it.
That's why I have this.

28:56.765 --> 29:00.000
I made my own servo
out of this huge motor.

29:00.001 --> 29:02.636
And this is gonna be
what's steering our car.

29:02.637 --> 29:05.806
Narrator:
And while grant installs
his remote-control system,

29:05.807 --> 29:07.741
Thanks to the time-lapse camera,

29:07.742 --> 29:10.077
Kari and tory
are making light work

29:10.078 --> 29:12.479
Of the phone-book papering.

29:12.480 --> 29:15.816
I don't know about you guys, but
I'm having an "a-team" moment.

29:15.817 --> 29:17.951
Narrator:
With the car fully booked

29:17.952 --> 29:19.787
And the remote control complete,

29:19.788 --> 29:22.656
The paperback rider
is loaded onto the truck,

29:22.657 --> 29:26.026
And they're off
to a familiar location.

29:27.028 --> 29:28.228
[ truck beeping ]

29:28.229 --> 29:30.764
Back at the quarry --
I love this place.

29:30.765 --> 29:34.101
Exploding cars,
exploding train stations,

29:34.102 --> 29:36.637
And, of course,
exploding cement mixers --

29:36.638 --> 29:39.106
This place has seen it all --

29:39.107 --> 29:41.875
Well, except this...

29:41.876 --> 29:46.046
The world's first
phone-book-armored car.

29:46.047 --> 29:48.115
Whoo!

29:48.116 --> 29:51.518
And first up, they need to check
grant's remote control.

29:51.519 --> 29:53.120
Look how low
it's riding in the front.

29:53.121 --> 29:54.421
Grant: Yeah.

29:54.422 --> 29:58.525
With an almighty 400 phone books
weighing it down,

29:58.526 --> 30:00.794
The car is not exactly built
for speed.

30:00.795 --> 30:02.596
So, how fast is
our getaway car going?

30:02.597 --> 30:05.065
Uh, 10 to 15 miles
an hour.

30:05.066 --> 30:07.101
So it's bulletproof, but you can
catch it on a bicycle.

30:07.102 --> 30:09.370
Hey, if it's
bulletproof enough,

30:09.371 --> 30:10.738
It doesn't need
to go any faster.

30:10.739 --> 30:12.172
Narrator: Grant's right.

30:12.173 --> 30:16.877
But how are they going to know
if it is bulletproof enough?

30:16.878 --> 30:19.480
Come on, trudy.

30:19.481 --> 30:22.683
That's right -- we've got
a whole inflatable family

30:22.684 --> 30:23.917
That we're gonna put in here.

30:23.918 --> 30:25.452
And if any
of these guys deflate,

30:25.453 --> 30:27.254
We'll know that a bullet
made it through.

30:27.255 --> 30:28.389
Ready?

30:28.390 --> 30:30.190
[ high-pitched voice ]
ready.

30:30.191 --> 30:32.426
Narrator: Right, and with our
inflatable friend at the wheel

30:32.427 --> 30:36.363
And the passengers lying in
the fully-fortified footwells,

30:36.364 --> 30:37.631
What's the plan?

30:37.632 --> 30:39.566
Ka: We are going to have
our bulletproof vehicle,

30:39.567 --> 30:42.369
Armored with phone directories,
at that end of the quarry.

30:42.370 --> 30:44.738
It's going to make
a mad dash 200 yards

30:44.739 --> 30:46.273
In that direction to safety.

30:46.274 --> 30:49.209
I'm gonna be up on that ridge
right there with my m1 garand,

30:49.210 --> 30:51.345
Tory right there
with a shotgun.

30:51.346 --> 30:52.880
You ready?
Ready!

30:52.881 --> 30:55.149
Grant, you ready?
Ready!

30:55.150 --> 30:57.651
Great.
It's time for science.

30:57.652 --> 30:59.820
Narrator: Remember,
they could use only 400

30:59.821 --> 31:01.688
Of the 900 phone books
it would take

31:01.689 --> 31:03.157
To create a fully armored car.

31:03.158 --> 31:07.394
So will their
strategic stuffing succeed

31:07.395 --> 31:09.863
In protecting both the engine
and the passengers?

31:09.864 --> 31:11.265
Shooters ready?

31:11.266 --> 31:12.266
Ready!

31:12.267 --> 31:13.801
Hitting the gas.

31:13.802 --> 31:15.602
Narrator:
Grant flicks a switch,

31:15.603 --> 31:18.238
And the paperback rider
lurches across the quarry.

31:18.239 --> 31:21.642
Then it's lock, stock,
and two smoking barrels

31:21.643 --> 31:25.479
As kari and tory
unload a barrage of bullets

31:25.480 --> 31:27.881
Into the paper armor...

31:27.882 --> 31:31.685
Until the phone-book jalopy
makes it to safety.

31:31.686 --> 31:35.255
Gas off, brake off, killing it.

31:35.256 --> 31:37.791
[ laughs ]

31:37.792 --> 31:41.128
I know I hit it, but I'm dying
to see if it made it through.

31:41.129 --> 31:44.097
That was so much fun.
It was like a shooting gallery.

31:44.098 --> 31:46.934
Narrator: There's no doubt
the bullets hit their mark,

31:46.935 --> 31:50.404
But did
the passengers survive?

31:50.405 --> 31:53.173
Yes, it's alive!

31:53.174 --> 31:54.541
Tory: They survived.
Kari: Yeah.

31:54.542 --> 31:56.276
Oh, my gosh.

31:56.277 --> 31:59.079
We made this vehicle bulletproof
with nothing but phone books.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.714
Wait, let's check
the passengers.

32:00.715 --> 32:02.749
One.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.384
There's chapman.
He's looking all right.

32:04.385 --> 32:06.753
And two.
He's all right, too.

32:06.754 --> 32:09.022
The whole family survived.

32:09.023 --> 32:11.391
Narrator: Against the shotgun
and the m14,

32:11.392 --> 32:13.961
The phone-book armor
did its job.

32:13.962 --> 32:15.829
Grant: So, the car
is in perfect working order,

32:15.830 --> 32:19.633
And all the passengers are alive
and accounted for.

32:19.634 --> 32:22.936
At this point,
the myth is looking very good.

32:22.937 --> 32:25.572
Narrator: The guys are
understandably psyched.

32:25.573 --> 32:27.674
Feel like
swing dancing.

32:27.675 --> 32:30.410
But the firearm fun
doesn't end here.

32:30.411 --> 32:33.213
Next up, the team comes out
all guns blazing...

32:33.214 --> 32:35.048
All right, one shot, one kill.
Let's do this.

32:35.049 --> 32:38.619
...In the bulletproof-phone-book
finale.

32:47.669 --> 32:49.270
Narrator:
Our blow-up passengers

32:49.270 --> 32:51.738
May have survived
the first shoot-'em-up.

32:51.739 --> 32:53.440
Yes, it's alive!

32:53.441 --> 32:55.041
But the mythbusters

32:55.042 --> 32:58.545
Aren't about to close the book
on this one yet.

32:58.546 --> 33:00.580
Now I think it's time
we take it up a notch.

33:00.581 --> 33:01.615
Oh, really?

33:01.616 --> 33:03.883
Let's say these guys
are real bad guys

33:03.884 --> 33:06.186
And they have
some serious weapons.

33:06.187 --> 33:08.989
Science gets more fun
when I get a bigger gun.

33:08.990 --> 33:11.391
Narrator:
Oh, it certainly does.

33:11.392 --> 33:15.161
And this time, the bad guys will
be packing some serious heat.

33:15.162 --> 33:17.130
Kari and I are gonna be
using the ump-40

33:17.131 --> 33:19.666
And the m16 fully automatic.

33:19.667 --> 33:21.368
Now, if it gets
past those guns,

33:21.369 --> 33:23.103
We're bringing out
the big guns.

33:23.104 --> 33:25.605
And just to make sure we get
enough rounds into our vehicle,

33:25.606 --> 33:26.973
We have a guest shooter --

33:26.974 --> 33:29.909
Deputy eric from
the calaveras county swat team.

33:29.910 --> 33:32.412
Folks,
welcome to the gun show.

33:32.413 --> 33:34.981
Narrator: With our phone-book
behemoth at the starting line

33:34.982 --> 33:38.685
And a trio of fully automatic
weapons trained on it,

33:38.686 --> 33:40.020
Grant calls the shots.

33:40.021 --> 33:43.523
All right, brake is coming off.
Here goes the gas.

33:43.524 --> 33:44.891
Just like last time,

33:44.892 --> 33:48.695
The car trundles
into the line of fire.

33:48.696 --> 33:50.330
[ gunfire ]

33:50.331 --> 33:54.467
The guns blaze, and the
phone-book confetti flies...

33:56.904 --> 34:00.240
...Until it reaches the end
of the gunshot gauntlet.

34:00.241 --> 34:04.678
Brake's on.
Killing the engine.

34:04.679 --> 34:06.346
That was fun.
Good shooting.

34:06.347 --> 34:08.081
Whoo!

34:08.081 --> 34:09.416
I say get
the yellow tape.

34:09.417 --> 34:11.551
I don't think trudy's
making it out of this one.

34:11.552 --> 34:12.985
I wonder if --

34:12.987 --> 34:15.554
Dang, look at how many hits
we got in this time.
Whoa.

34:15.556 --> 34:17.657
Narrator: The phone-book armor
is riddled with bullet holes,

34:17.658 --> 34:20.360
But what about
those passengers?

34:20.360 --> 34:22.462
Hey.
Hey.                      Hey.

34:22.463 --> 34:23.963
I see shredded paper.

34:23.964 --> 34:25.699
She's okay.

34:25.699 --> 34:26.833
Yeah, there's
definitely confetti.

34:26.833 --> 34:28.101
I mean, this is
not necessarily bulletproof,

34:28.101 --> 34:30.437
But she's
one lucky blow-up doll.

34:30.438 --> 34:33.505
Narrator:
And she's not the only one.

34:33.507 --> 34:36.576
Amazingly, the other two
passengers are also unharmed.

34:36.577 --> 34:40.746
This vehicle had a small coolant
leak, but it's still running.

34:40.748 --> 34:43.717
For all intents and purposes,
it's bulletproof.

34:43.717 --> 34:46.686
But, you know, the next thing
is likely to kill the car.

34:46.687 --> 34:48.254
Kari: To test this myth,

34:48.255 --> 34:50.724
We used a shotgun, an m1 garand,
and some machine guns.

34:50.725 --> 34:52.891
And it was a fun little game
of shoot-'em-up --

34:52.893 --> 34:54.527
Not quite adequate,

34:54.527 --> 34:57.964
So now we're moving on to...
The big guns.

34:57.965 --> 34:59.499
We have a .50-cal,

34:59.500 --> 35:01.401
We have a .416 barrett,

35:01.402 --> 35:03.536
And a .338 lapua.

35:03.537 --> 35:05.238
This should be fun.

35:05.239 --> 35:08.508
Narrator:
Fun could be an understatement.

35:08.509 --> 35:10.477
All right, one shot, one kill.
Let's do this.

35:10.478 --> 35:11.745
Shooters ready?

35:11.746 --> 35:13.113
Ready!
Ready!

35:13.114 --> 35:14.114
Here goes the gas.

35:15.750 --> 35:19.619
Narrator:
Let the car carnage begin.

35:22.323 --> 35:24.557
It's a rain of fire

35:24.558 --> 35:27.494
As the car is bombarded
with bullet after bullet...

35:29.096 --> 35:33.366
...Until kari lines up a shot
at the engine block, and...

35:36.537 --> 35:40.340
...It's all over for
the phone-book-escape escapade.

35:46.647 --> 35:49.282
Something stopped it.

35:49.283 --> 35:50.850
Oh, I think
I know what stopped it.

35:52.286 --> 35:54.621
[ laughs ]

35:54.622 --> 35:55.889
Tory: Kari took her shot.

35:55.890 --> 35:57.857
I swear to god,
I almost had a heart attack.

35:57.858 --> 35:59.225
I mean, the whole ground shook,

35:59.226 --> 36:00.794
There was
this big cloud of dust,

36:00.795 --> 36:03.663
And, basically, it was that shot
that stopped the vehicle.

36:03.664 --> 36:07.200
Man, these weapons
are incredible.

36:07.201 --> 36:09.269
Narrator:
Incredible and lethal.

36:09.270 --> 36:11.437
Oh, geez.

36:11.438 --> 36:14.407
Oh!
Oh!                          Oh!

36:14.408 --> 36:15.742
Yeah.

36:15.743 --> 36:17.110
She didn't make it.

36:17.111 --> 36:18.945
I don't think anybody
in there made it.

36:18.946 --> 36:21.548
Nobody made it.
They're both dead in the back.

36:22.950 --> 36:25.685
Narrator:
There's no denying that
the phone books bit the bullet,

36:25.686 --> 36:27.987
But where does that
leave the myth?

36:27.988 --> 36:30.156
Well, it's looking like
no amount of phone books

36:30.157 --> 36:32.225
Is gonna stop
one of these rounds.

36:32.226 --> 36:33.726
Yeah, but up to a .50-cal,

36:33.727 --> 36:36.396
This phone-book armor stopped
just about everything.

36:36.397 --> 36:38.131
Well, this is a perfect
progression of a story.

36:38.132 --> 36:41.067
I mean, with the first round
of guns, we're bulletproof.

36:41.068 --> 36:44.170
The second round of guns, we're
like, eh, bullet-resistant.

36:44.171 --> 36:45.371
And with the final round
of guns,

36:45.372 --> 36:48.741
We're more like, um,
like bullet-absorbent.

36:48.742 --> 36:50.610
All right,
who's driving home?

36:50.611 --> 36:52.212
Shotgun.

36:52.213 --> 36:54.981
[ laughter ]

36:58.853 --> 37:01.888
Narrator: Up next,
the "dive to survive" finale

37:01.889 --> 37:05.792
Goes off like a bomb.

37:12.495 --> 37:15.030
Narrator: Jamie and adam
are having a blast...

37:16.399 --> 37:17.706
The platform is gone.

37:17.706 --> 37:20.174
...To find out if a quick dip
could save your life.

37:20.175 --> 37:21.175
Adam: Wow!

37:21.176 --> 37:22.476
And now they're amping up

37:22.477 --> 37:25.045
For even more boom
for their buck.

37:25.046 --> 37:27.014
Jamie: For this blast,

37:27.015 --> 37:29.417
We're gonna use a blasting agent
called anfo.

37:29.418 --> 37:30.618
It's ammonium nitrate,

37:30.619 --> 37:33.454
Which is basically fertilizer
and diesel fuel.

37:33.455 --> 37:35.990
Now, that's gonna create
a pressure wave

37:35.991 --> 37:39.493
Moving out from the blast
at 4,000 feet per second.

37:39.494 --> 37:42.997
That pressure wave is
what's gonna burst our disks.

37:42.998 --> 37:45.499
Narrator:
That's the theory.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.468
And with a new set
of burst disks in place,

37:47.469 --> 37:49.837
They're ready
for a big anfo bang.

37:49.838 --> 37:51.572
Everything's in.
It looks great.

37:51.573 --> 37:54.308
But how will it compare
to gasoline?

37:54.309 --> 37:55.709
Adam:
It's definitely gonna burst

37:55.710 --> 37:59.613
The 5- and the 10-foot
burst disks in air.

37:59.614 --> 38:02.082
I don't think it's
gonna burst those in water.

38:02.083 --> 38:04.218
I think this is gonna
demonstrate a clear difference

38:04.219 --> 38:07.521
In the shock-wave propagation
in air as opposed to water.

38:07.522 --> 38:10.124
Narrator: Well, all is
about to be revealed

38:10.125 --> 38:12.092
As jamie takes the controls.

38:12.093 --> 38:13.494
We're good to go?

38:13.495 --> 38:15.229
You're good to go.
You are in control.

38:15.230 --> 38:16.964
All right, then.

38:16.965 --> 38:18.466
And remember,

38:18.467 --> 38:21.635
Don't try this kind of boom
in your own lagoon.

38:21.636 --> 38:23.370
Adam:
Fire in the hole.

38:23.371 --> 38:25.105
Fire in the hole.

38:25.106 --> 38:26.574
Fire in the hole.

38:26.575 --> 38:28.075
Take it away.

38:28.076 --> 38:31.679
50 pounds of anfo...

38:31.680 --> 38:36.717
In 3...2...1.

38:36.718 --> 38:39.186
Bye-bye.

38:39.187 --> 38:41.322
Wow!

38:44.493 --> 38:46.060
Whoops.

38:46.061 --> 38:49.730
50 pounds of anfo almost
obliterated the rig entirely.

38:49.731 --> 38:52.233
It's suddenly become
a recovery mission.

38:52.234 --> 38:53.534
[ laughs ]

38:53.535 --> 38:56.504
A recovery mission, indeed,

38:56.505 --> 38:59.440
But what has the
4,000-feet-per-second shock wave

38:59.441 --> 39:01.876
Done to the burst disks?

39:01.877 --> 39:03.944
Okay. Oh!

39:03.945 --> 39:06.747
It's burst?
It's clean through.

39:06.748 --> 39:08.282
Really?
Yeah.

39:08.283 --> 39:10.384
Well, god, I wonder what it's
gonna look like underneath.

39:10.385 --> 39:11.685
Yeah,
that's the big question.

39:11.686 --> 39:13.787
So, at 50 feet above water,

39:13.788 --> 39:15.523
The furthest distance
from the explosion,

39:15.524 --> 39:17.358
The disks are burst.

39:17.359 --> 39:19.593
But underwater...

39:19.594 --> 39:23.297
Both burst disks
are burst.

39:23.298 --> 39:24.732
Wow.

39:24.733 --> 39:28.235
50 pounds of anfo burst
every single pressure disk,

39:28.236 --> 39:30.838
But that huge blast
is making it difficult

39:30.839 --> 39:33.941
For the guys to call this one
just yet.

39:33.942 --> 39:36.143
Not really the definitive result
we're looking for.

39:36.144 --> 39:38.379
I'm hoping for more
from dynamite.

39:38.380 --> 39:40.714
Narrator: That's right --

39:40.715 --> 39:44.718
The mythbusters have one more
explosive for bomb disposal.

39:44.719 --> 39:47.721
This time around, we're using
50 pounds of dynamite.

39:47.722 --> 39:49.256
That's 25 of these things.

39:49.257 --> 39:51.191
Now, dynamite is
a high explosive

39:51.192 --> 39:52.726
That creates a pressure wave

39:52.727 --> 39:54.428
That moves at 9,000 feet
per second in air.

39:54.429 --> 39:57.097
Narrator:
Ready for detonation.

39:57.098 --> 40:01.302
Look at it go, our little
tetrahedron of death.

40:01.303 --> 40:03.537
[ laughs ]

40:03.538 --> 40:07.441
Narrator: Yep, it's all down
to that little tetrahedron.

40:07.442 --> 40:10.444
The gas explosion showed you'd
be better off underwater,

40:10.445 --> 40:13.747
Whereas the anfo detonation
was total devastation

40:13.748 --> 40:16.250
Above or below the surface.

40:16.251 --> 40:19.954
So now it's all down
to the dynamite decider.

40:19.955 --> 40:21.722
Jamie:
Fire in the hole.

40:21.723 --> 40:23.857
Fire in the hole.

40:23.858 --> 40:26.293
Fire in the hole.

40:26.294 --> 40:28.329
All right,
I'm gonna do it.

40:28.330 --> 40:30.431
50 pounds of dynamite...

40:30.432 --> 40:34.902
In 3...2...1.

40:39.541 --> 40:40.541
Oh, yeah.

40:40.542 --> 40:43.711
Wow.
That was a thud.

40:43.712 --> 40:45.846
That was more
than the anfo.

40:45.847 --> 40:49.416
The dynamite explosion
was, well, dynamite.

40:49.417 --> 40:53.320
I can only see
one of our things left.

40:53.321 --> 40:55.889
Yeah.
Salvage operation.

41:00.929 --> 41:04.365
The rig has clearly been
decimated by the dynamite,

41:04.366 --> 41:06.867
But will
the underwater burst disks

41:06.868 --> 41:08.769
Have suffered the same fate?

41:12.407 --> 41:16.477
It's a hilarious horror show
down here.

41:16.478 --> 41:20.748
The 5-, the 10-,
and the 20-foot marker

41:20.749 --> 41:23.150
Are all huddled together.

41:23.151 --> 41:26.720
They're still attached
to the rope,

41:26.721 --> 41:29.523
But every single burst disk
on all three of them

41:29.524 --> 41:32.359
Is completely blown --
over.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.762
Well, I'll be darned.

41:34.763 --> 41:38.065
Narrator: Underwater at 5,
10, and 20 feet,

41:38.066 --> 41:41.535
The disks are broken,
a pattern mirrored above water,

41:41.536 --> 41:44.304
But how about the 50-footer?

41:44.305 --> 41:46.607
Well,
that's clean through.

41:46.608 --> 41:50.944
Above water, it's burst.
However...

41:50.945 --> 41:52.479
You're gonna love this,
jamie.

41:52.480 --> 41:55.549
The 50-foot mast
10 foot down --

41:55.550 --> 41:59.186
The burst disk is intact.

41:59.187 --> 42:01.388
Well, that says something
really strong about the myth.

42:01.389 --> 42:04.258
That's great.
What about the 5-footer?

42:04.259 --> 42:08.295
The 5-footer
is also intact.

42:08.296 --> 42:11.598
Repeat --
the 5-footer is also intact.

42:14.235 --> 42:16.370
What happened
at this 50-foot marker

42:16.371 --> 42:20.007
Is really interesting

42:20.008 --> 42:22.810
Because we have a blown disk
above water

42:22.811 --> 42:25.779
But we have intact disks
below water.

42:25.780 --> 42:27.848
Narrator:
So that's a bombshell result.

42:27.849 --> 42:29.783
Just like
the gasoline explosion,

42:29.784 --> 42:32.186
When it comes
to a dynamite bomb,

42:32.187 --> 42:35.189
Diving underwater
would make a difference.

42:35.190 --> 42:37.758
[ laughs ]
explosives are funny creatures.

42:37.759 --> 42:39.526
The anfo broke our rope

42:39.527 --> 42:41.195
And decimated
two out of our four masts.

42:41.196 --> 42:43.564
The dynamite
did not break our rope

42:43.565 --> 42:45.999
But decimated
three out of the four.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.004
However, it burst
all of the in-air burst disks

42:51.005 --> 42:53.807
But not the two underwater
burst disks on the 50.

42:53.808 --> 42:56.643
That is the kind of result
that I was hoping for.

42:56.644 --> 42:59.379
That tells me that there really
might be something for the myth.

42:59.380 --> 43:01.348
Am I gonna use
one of the three magic words?

43:01.349 --> 43:03.350
No, not until I'm with jamie
at the very end.

43:07.422 --> 43:08.922
So, where do we stand?

43:08.923 --> 43:11.258
Well, in a situation
like this...

43:11.259 --> 43:14.928
.Harp play ]

43:14.929 --> 43:16.663
...It's plausible
that the water

43:16.664 --> 43:18.565
Would protect you
from an explosion.

43:18.566 --> 43:21.068
Plausible, it is.
Let's get out of here.
Okay.

43:23.371 --> 43:26.373
