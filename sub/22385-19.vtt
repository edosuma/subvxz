WEBVTT

00:01.333 --> 00:03.440
_

00:07.373 --> 00:10.322
It's over. General Baxter's
killing the project.

00:10.389 --> 00:12.443
Over? We've barely started.

00:12.511 --> 00:13.911
Crawford needs the weapon to be

00:13.979 --> 00:15.938
far more reliable
and portable before we...

00:15.985 --> 00:19.709
I understand, but I'm still a
year away from that at least.

00:19.922 --> 00:21.285
I thought I could hold off Baxter,

00:21.353 --> 00:24.243
but he keeps asking
for a demonstration.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.965
No, Crawford was clear.
The government can't know

00:26.991 --> 00:28.135
that it's operational.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.862
He expects me to continue
paying for its development.

00:31.230 --> 00:34.132
My firm has already taken a
quarter of a billion dollars

00:34.199 --> 00:36.000
in military research funding.

00:36.346 --> 00:38.225
How well does the prototype function?

00:38.270 --> 00:41.039
When it works, it's like
nothing else in the world.

00:41.420 --> 00:43.180
Baxter wants a demonstration?

00:43.714 --> 00:46.244
Then maybe we should give him one.

00:46.370 --> 00:48.171
When is he flying back to DC?

00:52.551 --> 00:55.353
What's going on up there?

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:04.549 --> 01:06.617
What the hell?

01:18.944 --> 01:21.129
I know he did horrible things
for Hank Crawford,

01:21.154 --> 01:24.515
but I just don't see
a monster when I look at him.

01:24.583 --> 01:26.084
I still just see Dad.

01:27.223 --> 01:29.587
Yeah, it was hard for me to see
my mother for who she was, too.

01:29.655 --> 01:30.755
That's different.

01:30.823 --> 01:32.740
You can't even remember your childhood.

01:33.133 --> 01:36.961
This is a lifetime
of memories all ruined.

01:37.778 --> 01:39.297
I should just toss them.

01:39.518 --> 01:41.750
Patterson's already analyzed
them, and we're still no closer

01:41.775 --> 01:43.760
- to catching Crawford.
- That's not true.

01:43.913 --> 01:46.504
We've mapped out where
your dad traveled and when,

01:46.572 --> 01:48.509
flagged business associates.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.210
I know they're just pieces,
but the more we have,

01:51.235 --> 01:53.328
the better chance we have
of taking down Crawford.

01:53.392 --> 01:55.128
Even with Roman on his side now?

01:55.328 --> 01:56.730
Roman is desperate.

01:56.910 --> 01:59.417
Sending hitmen to try
and kill all of us is proof.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.754
I promise you, we will take them down.

02:04.383 --> 02:05.823
I hope it happens soon.

02:05.891 --> 02:09.293
These FBI nannies
are getting pretty old.

02:11.469 --> 02:13.603
Thanks for the coffee.

02:22.369 --> 02:23.730
Please tell me you have something.

02:23.755 --> 02:25.695
I have a whole lot of nothing,

02:25.720 --> 02:27.421
which is something. Look...

02:27.514 --> 02:29.007
This is the plot of land

02:29.032 --> 02:30.972
Crawford purchased from
Jean-Paul Bruyere.

02:31.016 --> 02:33.812
It's smack dab in the center
of the Sahara desert.

02:33.892 --> 02:35.032
How'd you figure this out?

02:35.057 --> 02:37.404
I've been sifting through.
Bruyere's real estate holdings.

02:37.429 --> 02:38.829
This is huge.
Why'd you say it was nothing?

02:38.857 --> 02:40.372
Well, I meant the land.

02:40.397 --> 02:43.018
The land is nothing and
used to be rich in minerals,

02:43.125 --> 02:46.731
cobalt, aluminum, copper,
but now it's been stripped dry.

02:46.798 --> 02:48.799
It's a wasteland.

02:49.119 --> 02:50.983
Maybe it's not what's there, maybe it's

02:51.008 --> 02:52.003
what will be there.

02:52.035 --> 02:53.143
Yeah, you're right. What is he

02:53.168 --> 02:54.660
building out in the middle of nowhere?

02:54.712 --> 02:55.879
Oh.

02:55.937 --> 02:57.288
I think I broke it,
it's doing something.

02:57.312 --> 02:59.265
No. The tattoo database got a hit.

02:59.330 --> 03:00.601
Well, doesn't that happen all the time?

03:00.625 --> 03:02.460
Almost all the new tattoos

03:02.500 --> 03:04.301
required a hint from Roman to solve.

03:04.326 --> 03:06.540
Now that he's sided with Crawford,

03:06.565 --> 03:08.196
the database has been totally silent,

03:08.239 --> 03:10.407
so something outside of Roman's control

03:10.542 --> 03:11.915
must have triggered the system.

03:12.010 --> 03:14.311
- Which tattoo?
- The beetle.

03:15.740 --> 03:18.573
_

03:27.268 --> 03:28.501
Is that my dad?

03:28.560 --> 03:30.101
Um... No, no, no.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.751
It's just a sort of Google
alert I set up on my phone.

03:33.291 --> 03:35.412
- I gotta go to New York.
- Now?

03:35.480 --> 03:37.832
Does this have something to do
with the FBI raid at my gala?

03:37.883 --> 03:39.884
No. No, no, no, it's boring, trust me.

03:40.051 --> 03:42.919
Boring like my dad buying
land from a terrorist?

03:43.254 --> 03:44.586
That's why you need
to leave immediately,

03:44.610 --> 03:46.310
why you can't tell me what it is.

03:46.424 --> 03:48.280
- Blake...
- No, I'm part of this company, too,

03:48.305 --> 03:50.239
and I'm tired of
being kept in the dark.

03:52.384 --> 03:54.018
We're not trying to
keep you in the dark.

03:54.131 --> 03:56.542
We're trying to keep you safe.
This trip's just gonna be

03:56.588 --> 03:57.966
a long line of meetings
and more meetings.

03:57.990 --> 04:00.914
That you can't tell me about.

04:02.474 --> 04:05.242
Okay, well, you better get going.

04:05.363 --> 04:07.130
Just stay safe, Tom.

04:11.623 --> 04:13.957
I'll call you when I land.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.476
That thing's kind of ugly,
even for an insect.

04:22.822 --> 04:25.270
That's because it's two
completely different species.

04:25.322 --> 04:26.604
The left side's a golden stag,

04:26.650 --> 04:28.857
the right side is a rhinoceros beetle.

04:30.180 --> 04:31.763
Why are you looking at me like that?

04:31.788 --> 04:32.855
I have other interests.

04:32.967 --> 04:34.779
So, it's one of a kind.

04:35.132 --> 04:37.153
Is that why the database
didn't match it to anything?

04:37.221 --> 04:39.856
Until today. So this
book, "Golden Rhino,"

04:40.106 --> 04:43.593
was just posted for pre-order
on WriteBound.com.

04:43.898 --> 04:46.805
The summary claims that
it reveals the military's

04:46.851 --> 04:49.039
best-kept and most explosive secret.

04:49.064 --> 04:50.745
So what do we know about the author?

04:50.999 --> 04:52.333
Daschelle Watkins.

04:52.485 --> 04:55.262
No government or military
background, no arrests.

04:55.315 --> 04:57.919
He was a history professor at Cornell

04:57.991 --> 04:59.951
but denied tenure a few years back.

05:00.038 --> 05:02.480
There must be some reason Roman was

05:02.505 --> 05:04.113
- pointing us toward him.
- Let's bring him in.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.439
See what this explosive
secret's all about.

05:09.797 --> 05:11.297
Okay, Daschelle.

05:11.364 --> 05:12.564
Call me Dash.

05:12.738 --> 05:15.106
Dash. Tell us about your book.

05:15.174 --> 05:17.211
The one you're trying to
stop me from publishing?

05:17.316 --> 05:18.716
Please. It's been on pre-order

05:18.770 --> 05:20.477
for two hours and you guys haul me in?

05:20.558 --> 05:22.445
Our joint task force
roots out corruption.

05:22.487 --> 05:24.637
Now, if your secrets are as
explosive as you say they are,

05:24.662 --> 05:26.263
we need to investigate them.

05:26.384 --> 05:28.418
You can help me get
the truth out there?

05:28.500 --> 05:32.836
Yeah, yes, we can. Definitely.

05:33.826 --> 05:35.260
The truth about what?

05:35.767 --> 05:37.234
Golden Rhino.

05:37.309 --> 05:40.007
It's a super secret
military weapons program,

05:40.672 --> 05:43.240
and it's responsible
for the assassination

05:43.375 --> 05:45.342
of General Joseph Baxter.

05:47.324 --> 05:49.459
He died in a plane crash.
That was an accident.

05:49.484 --> 05:50.817
Sure, on paper.

05:50.842 --> 05:53.361
But Baxter was involved
in the development

05:53.431 --> 05:55.136
of the most advanced weapon system

05:55.180 --> 05:56.981
the military has ever commissioned,

05:57.058 --> 05:58.604
and when he tried to cut funding,

05:58.663 --> 06:01.899
that very weapon was used to kill him.

06:03.849 --> 06:05.717
So how do you know all of this?

06:06.224 --> 06:07.664
I did my own research.

06:07.747 --> 06:08.992
Define research.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.841
Classified government documents.

06:10.922 --> 06:12.490
How did you get these documents?

06:12.563 --> 06:13.746
I had a hacker group find

06:13.771 --> 06:15.370
Golden Rhino communication logs.

06:15.527 --> 06:17.394
And those prove Baxter
was assassinated.

06:17.569 --> 06:20.104
I mean, it's fragments,
but if you know where to look

06:20.466 --> 06:22.910
and how to put it
all together, which I do,

06:23.382 --> 06:25.383
it's pretty clear what happened.

06:25.584 --> 06:28.586
Let's just pretend it's not, for fun.

06:28.686 --> 06:30.921
Someone very wealthy and very powerful

06:31.103 --> 06:32.589
wanted that weapon for themselves

06:32.657 --> 06:34.759
and that's exactly what they got.

06:39.317 --> 06:40.671
What does this weapon do?

06:40.696 --> 06:41.762
I can't tell you.

06:41.787 --> 06:43.521
I... I... I need to show you.

06:43.575 --> 06:45.105
I need my research, my book.

06:45.176 --> 06:47.745
Okay. We'll make sure
agents get you your stuff.

06:48.354 --> 06:50.526
If we're joining forces,
I need to ask you,

06:51.285 --> 06:53.658
are you willing to see
this through to the end?

06:54.045 --> 06:56.695
Because this weapon,
it can strike anyone,

06:56.754 --> 06:59.022
anywhere, and it leaves no trace.

06:59.164 --> 07:02.633
And if it gets out that you're
investigating Golden Rhino,

07:02.775 --> 07:06.110
then everyone in this
building will be a target.

07:19.886 --> 07:20.886
Here's your book.

07:20.911 --> 07:21.978
Out with it.

07:22.035 --> 07:23.402
We want specifics on Golden Rhino.

07:23.754 --> 07:25.154
Why don't you read it?

07:25.760 --> 07:27.552
Nope. There's too many pages.

07:27.586 --> 07:28.682
Just give us the Cliff's Notes.

07:28.707 --> 07:29.933
It's a very quick read.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.167
Actually, there's a sizeable

07:31.192 --> 07:32.367
photo section right in the middle here.

07:32.391 --> 07:33.858
Just tell us what the weapon is.

07:33.926 --> 07:37.796
Okay. But first let's start
with who the weapon is.

07:38.971 --> 07:41.439
Michael Ganzman.

07:41.819 --> 07:44.185
He was the lead engineer
for Varnew Industries.

07:44.289 --> 07:45.856
Varnew is one of the largest

07:45.881 --> 07:47.070
defense contractors in the country.

07:47.094 --> 07:48.662
We know what they do.

07:49.047 --> 07:51.682
Look, this is the same emblem
that's on your book.

07:51.937 --> 07:54.220
See? It's all there.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.102
It's not all there, Dash.
It's all redacted.

07:58.204 --> 07:59.563
Read between the lines.

07:59.632 --> 08:01.416
What does Golden Rhino do?

08:01.487 --> 08:04.525
Ganzman can explain it better,
but he's been off the grid

08:04.550 --> 08:07.225
for a couple of months. Maybe
the FBI can track him down.

08:07.376 --> 08:09.469
Why won't you answer
that simple question?

08:09.554 --> 08:11.288
Because you'll think I'm crazy.

08:11.610 --> 08:13.578
Answer the question.

08:15.982 --> 08:17.926
It's a mind control device.

08:18.686 --> 08:20.487
So that's why his book
had to be self-published.

08:20.511 --> 08:21.845
He's a conspiracy nut.

08:21.887 --> 08:23.588
Yeah, to put it mildly.

08:23.789 --> 08:26.564
I've been digging through this
research from his apartment.

08:26.898 --> 08:28.197
He has theories on everything.

08:28.222 --> 08:29.958
Dinosaurs never existed.

08:29.983 --> 08:31.417
The moon landing was fake.

08:31.456 --> 08:33.957
The Boston mob bought the
Patriots' Super Bowl victories.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.820
That one makes sense to me.

08:35.845 --> 08:37.461
It didn't work this year.

08:37.549 --> 08:39.602
All right, I know all this
sounds crazy, no doubt,

08:39.642 --> 08:41.328
but what he said about Ganzman is true.

08:41.352 --> 08:42.923
He worked at Varnew until he got fired,

08:42.948 --> 08:44.107
then dropped off the map.

08:44.133 --> 08:46.173
And there was a real weapons contract

08:46.198 --> 08:47.802
between Varnew and General Baxter.

08:47.854 --> 08:49.287
Classified military tech does sound

08:49.312 --> 08:50.679
like something Crawford would be into.

08:50.770 --> 08:52.267
Maybe we should
bring in some of the execs

08:52.291 --> 08:53.716
from Varnew, see if they'll talk.

08:53.779 --> 08:55.146
No, if we go after them directly,

08:55.193 --> 08:56.527
their lawyers will eat us alive.

08:56.602 --> 08:58.503
I think we should focus
on finding Ganzman for now.

08:58.570 --> 08:59.992
If he's not dead.

09:00.052 --> 09:02.811
I haven't been able to find
any digital footprint on him

09:02.849 --> 09:03.910
since he dropped off the grid.

09:03.935 --> 09:05.386
Well, look into his analog life.

09:05.411 --> 09:06.438
You got all these boxes here.

09:06.463 --> 09:09.065
This is not even
a quarter of Dash's files,

09:09.135 --> 09:11.215
and there's no system to any of this.

09:11.322 --> 09:12.829
- It's all just...
- Get him to help you make sense of it.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.621
That assumes there's sense to make.

09:14.646 --> 09:16.213
- You'll be fine.
- This is...

09:16.280 --> 09:17.838
Yeah. Who doesn't want to sift

09:17.863 --> 09:21.078
through the collected works
of a madman with...

09:21.210 --> 09:24.696
said madman. That sounds super fun.

09:25.071 --> 09:28.806
Hey. Can I talk to you about Avery?

09:29.045 --> 09:31.447
- What about her?
- I'm worried she's in a bad place.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.254
With everything she's
learned about her dad

09:33.279 --> 09:36.170
and then being stuck in
that safe house, I just...

09:36.608 --> 09:38.476
I don't want her to
feel like a prisoner.

09:38.998 --> 09:42.482
She is a prisoner. Kind of.

09:42.821 --> 09:44.648
Roman just took a shot at all of us,

09:44.742 --> 09:47.692
so we have to assume that
Avery is a target as well.

09:48.145 --> 09:50.395
Maybe there's a better way
to protect her.

09:51.356 --> 09:52.817
Like?

09:53.832 --> 09:55.900
What if she moved in with us?

09:57.723 --> 09:59.056
Really?

09:59.772 --> 10:01.673
Yeah. Sure.

10:02.853 --> 10:06.778
But it's not up to us to
make that decision, right?

10:06.991 --> 10:08.892
It's up to Avery.

10:15.955 --> 10:18.182
I'm telling you, nothing here
will help us find Ganzman.

10:18.222 --> 10:20.959
I've been searching for him
for months using this stuff

10:20.984 --> 10:22.028
and there's zero,

10:22.053 --> 10:23.317
- nothing.
- Just point me

10:23.342 --> 10:24.770
to everything that you have on him.

10:24.795 --> 10:27.398
There's a little bit
sprinkled in every box.

10:27.852 --> 10:29.750
How is that even a filing system?

10:29.775 --> 10:31.318
No, no, no.
This is not a filing system.

10:31.343 --> 10:33.388
This is a security system, okay?

10:33.413 --> 10:34.666
In case anyone comes looking.

10:34.691 --> 10:37.245
Someone is looking. Us.

10:38.580 --> 10:42.213
Okay. I am looking at
the same intel as you

10:42.281 --> 10:43.915
and nothing here says mind control.

10:43.983 --> 10:45.293
They're not gonna
spell it all out for you.

10:45.317 --> 10:47.544
These are all pieces
to a bigger puzzle.

10:47.640 --> 10:49.441
You just need to see it.

10:49.548 --> 10:52.291
Better yet, listen.

10:58.265 --> 10:59.673
A copy of the black box recorder

10:59.698 --> 11:02.333
from Baxter's plane before it crashed.

11:04.170 --> 11:05.403
How do you have that?

11:05.485 --> 11:07.786
Let's just say I bought it
on the dark web.

11:08.386 --> 11:10.220
Did you buy it on the dark web?

11:10.890 --> 11:13.057
Yes. Let's plug it in here.

11:13.899 --> 11:16.367
Okay, okay, hands off
my computers, Mulder.

11:20.467 --> 11:22.110
<i>Check heading, 2-7-0.</i>

11:22.183 --> 11:23.496
<i>2-7-0, copy.</i>

11:23.550 --> 11:24.922
<i>Read back airspeed.</i>

11:25.264 --> 11:27.165
<i>Hey, are you okay? What's...</i>

11:27.392 --> 11:29.359
The windows, they shatter.

11:31.630 --> 11:33.277
Neither pilot calls for help.

11:33.438 --> 11:35.272
They just...

11:35.739 --> 11:37.135
They just go silent.

11:37.468 --> 11:39.369
And then the warbles.

11:40.273 --> 11:41.406
I'm sorry.

11:41.533 --> 11:42.900
The... warbles?

11:42.975 --> 11:44.539
The brain ray.

11:45.277 --> 11:47.245
You hear it.

11:47.978 --> 11:49.080
I hear static.

11:49.105 --> 11:51.990
Pulsey static. Warbles.

11:52.065 --> 11:55.177
Okay, thank you for that

11:55.594 --> 11:58.463
very illuminating bunch of nothing.

12:00.626 --> 12:02.260
What is this a list of?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.429
Suspects.

12:05.072 --> 12:06.418
For?

12:06.631 --> 12:08.299
Triggermen.

12:10.662 --> 12:12.780
- Found Ganzman yet?
- You left me in a room

12:12.805 --> 12:14.505
with a hundred boxes full of garbage

12:14.530 --> 12:16.502
and a lunatic ranting
about a brain ray,

12:16.548 --> 12:18.728
so let's just lower our expectations

12:18.753 --> 12:19.950
just a little bit, okay?

12:19.975 --> 12:21.268
So what have you found?

12:21.293 --> 12:23.427
Potentially, a triggerman.

12:23.627 --> 12:25.764
See, Ganzman couldn't
have fired the weapon

12:25.789 --> 12:26.977
at Baxter's plane.

12:27.052 --> 12:28.323
He was speaking at a conference

12:28.348 --> 12:31.874
that day in Miami, so Dash made

12:31.899 --> 12:34.561
a suspect list of every out-of-towner

12:34.586 --> 12:36.527
within 100 miles of the crash site

12:36.595 --> 12:38.363
using hotel reservations,

12:38.430 --> 12:41.222
credit card transactions
and cell tower data.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.448
- That is a pretty wide net.
- Yeah.

12:43.568 --> 12:46.942
Until I cross-referenced
his list with our database

12:47.002 --> 12:49.841
and came up with
one very interesting guy

12:49.908 --> 12:52.343
staying within six miles
of the crash site.

12:52.487 --> 12:55.622
Surjik Fells. Two tours in Afghanistan,

12:55.647 --> 12:58.049
dishonorably discharged
for drug possession.

12:58.222 --> 13:02.632
First job out of the military,
security gig at Varnew,

13:02.721 --> 13:04.333
hired by Ganzman himself.

13:04.416 --> 13:06.650
- Where's Fells now?
- Back in prison,

13:06.725 --> 13:09.012
arrested three months ago
on another drug charge.

13:09.435 --> 13:12.971
I'll call the warden, get him
transferred to our custody.

13:27.846 --> 13:29.380
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:29.592 --> 13:30.912
Hello, Surjik.

13:38.376 --> 13:39.791
The dash cam captured everything.

13:40.082 --> 13:41.937
- When did this happen?
- About an hour ago.

13:41.962 --> 13:43.071
Roman must've gotten a heads-up

13:43.095 --> 13:44.450
when the tattoo got triggered.

13:44.475 --> 13:45.588
He's sabotaging us.

13:45.613 --> 13:46.813
He knew we'd be going after Fell,

13:46.852 --> 13:48.118
so he beat us to him.

13:48.220 --> 13:49.854
He must be going after Ganzman, too.

13:49.928 --> 13:51.489
Whatever this weapon does,

13:51.543 --> 13:54.004
Roman just stole
our only way to find it.

14:08.360 --> 14:09.927
What the hell do you want, man?

14:09.978 --> 14:11.714
Where's Michael Ganzman?

14:11.813 --> 14:14.061
Who?

14:14.428 --> 14:15.828
I know you worked with him.

14:15.863 --> 14:18.865
I know you stayed in contact.
Where is he?

14:18.890 --> 14:21.384
I've been in jail.
How would I... Oh, God!

14:21.476 --> 14:23.633
I know you used his weapon

14:23.658 --> 14:25.325
to bring down Baxter's plane for him.

14:25.473 --> 14:27.510
Now, a guy as careful as
Ganzman isn't letting you live

14:27.535 --> 14:29.362
without checking in once in a while.

14:29.387 --> 14:30.688
I don't know, maybe even paying you off

14:30.713 --> 14:32.046
while you were in jail
so you don't give him up.

14:32.070 --> 14:34.318
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

14:34.562 --> 14:36.908
- Okay.
- No, wait, wait!

14:37.698 --> 14:39.002
Oh, Jesus.

14:39.408 --> 14:40.967
Let me rephrase.

14:41.342 --> 14:44.811
Where's Ganzman?

14:50.906 --> 14:53.607
Make a sound and it's
the last one you hear, got it?

14:56.010 --> 14:57.748
Hey, I was just gonna call you.

14:57.812 --> 14:59.046
<i>Tom, where are you?</i>

14:59.098 --> 15:01.543
Oh, just... just got
to the hotel. Settling in.

15:01.603 --> 15:03.071
<i>Great, I'm leaving the airport now.</i>

15:03.121 --> 15:05.802
- You're in New York?
- <i>Yeah, I'll see you soon.</i>

15:05.827 --> 15:07.995
<i>Oh, I gotta run. Bye.</i>

15:10.276 --> 15:12.899
Turns out I'm a little
pressed for time.

15:13.104 --> 15:15.006
Just bought you a little more.

15:15.401 --> 15:16.503
Must be your lucky day.

15:16.538 --> 15:17.674
Just please... No, stop!

15:17.699 --> 15:19.366
Please! Please, wait!

15:19.413 --> 15:21.370
Wait! Okay, wait!

15:22.143 --> 15:23.944
Look, as crazy as it sounds,

15:23.969 --> 15:26.604
Dash's conspiracy theory
must have some truth to it.

15:26.629 --> 15:28.661
Why else would Roman stick
his neck out to grab Fells?

15:28.694 --> 15:29.932
To protect Crawford.

15:29.957 --> 15:32.425
If this weapons program
leads back to him,

15:32.450 --> 15:33.671
Ganzman's a loose thread.

15:33.696 --> 15:35.330
I've authorized a full scale manhunt.

15:35.524 --> 15:36.691
And I've put together a list

15:36.751 --> 15:38.335
of every place Ganzman's ever rented,

15:38.360 --> 15:39.627
owned, or squatted in.

15:39.655 --> 15:41.555
We've sent teams
to every one of them now.

15:41.580 --> 15:43.866
In the meantime, I want you two
to go to Varnew Industries

15:43.891 --> 15:45.659
and bring in all their
top execs for questioning.

15:45.693 --> 15:47.957
I thought it was too big of
a risk to go to them directly.

15:47.982 --> 15:49.616
I know. That was before
Roman got involved.

15:49.641 --> 15:51.208
Now it's a race.

15:55.443 --> 15:57.655
- How's that paralytic?
- Please...

15:57.712 --> 15:59.479
There's only one way out of this.

15:59.981 --> 16:01.699
Tell me where Ganzman is.

16:01.850 --> 16:03.283
I don't...

16:08.889 --> 16:10.796
Don't what? Don't want to live?

16:10.866 --> 16:12.700
Keep doing what you're doing.

16:14.029 --> 16:15.096
Tom?

16:16.790 --> 16:18.024
Shh.

16:19.148 --> 16:21.149
It's me.

16:21.255 --> 16:22.656
Hello?

16:23.838 --> 16:26.073
Are you up here?

16:26.367 --> 16:28.568
Tom, are you up here?

16:28.822 --> 16:31.230
Hey. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in.

16:31.279 --> 16:32.680
I was just about to get cleaned up.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.462
No, I can see that.

16:34.511 --> 16:35.678
So how come you're here?

16:35.710 --> 16:37.426
Um, I mean, not that I'm complaining...

16:37.491 --> 16:41.011
I... I actually wanted to finish
our conversation from earlier.

16:42.456 --> 16:44.886
Okay. Well, um...

16:45.373 --> 16:47.523
Why don't you go unpack, settle in?

16:47.599 --> 16:49.834
I'll finish up in there
and then we can talk.

16:51.199 --> 16:52.866
Okay.

17:09.416 --> 17:12.117
Okay, now we're both out of time.

17:12.185 --> 17:14.170
Tell me where Ganzman is
or you're fish food.

17:14.214 --> 17:15.615
I told you I...

17:18.260 --> 17:20.327
Shh.

17:20.621 --> 17:23.189
Choke quieter.

17:24.265 --> 17:25.397
You're insane.

17:25.459 --> 17:28.608
Yes, which is why
you should not upset me.

17:28.976 --> 17:30.443
- Bye, Surjik.
- Oneonta!

17:30.578 --> 17:32.012
- Oneonta.
- Shh.

17:32.716 --> 17:33.940
It's a cabin.

17:34.008 --> 17:35.642
He bought it from a friend.

17:35.710 --> 17:38.379
- You're sure?
- He paid cash so it couldn't be traced.

17:38.426 --> 17:39.522
And that's the only place?

17:39.547 --> 17:40.781
There's nowhere else he could be?

17:41.421 --> 17:43.235
There's a factory.

17:43.684 --> 17:45.151
- Where?
- Woodstock.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.033
He... He leases it.

17:47.094 --> 17:49.563
But he'd have to be desperate to...

17:50.137 --> 17:52.138
Please, don't kill me.

18:03.194 --> 18:04.838
I know you're upset I had to run off.

18:04.905 --> 18:06.868
No, it's not just that.

18:07.226 --> 18:08.587
You haven't unpacked.

18:08.697 --> 18:10.693
Because all I want to do
is talk to you,

18:10.978 --> 18:13.079
and that hasn't been easy.

18:13.227 --> 18:14.572
Okay.

18:15.883 --> 18:18.284
I'm all ears.

18:19.131 --> 18:22.581
My relationship with my father
has always been frustrating.

18:22.757 --> 18:25.859
Information flows one way
and it's never from him.

18:25.926 --> 18:27.200
And the way you left me this morning

18:27.225 --> 18:28.470
gave me that exact same feeling,

18:28.495 --> 18:30.096
like you're keeping things from me.

18:30.238 --> 18:33.907
That is not what I was trying to do.

18:34.068 --> 18:36.169
I don't want our relationship to become

18:36.223 --> 18:38.094
just as opaque as the one
I have with my father.

18:38.119 --> 18:39.953
I want more for us.

18:40.067 --> 18:42.068
So do I.

18:42.182 --> 18:44.126
I know I need to be more present

18:44.171 --> 18:48.421
and more open with you,
and I know I can do that.

18:50.524 --> 18:52.433
Starting right now.

18:53.046 --> 18:54.596
How about a little trip upstate,

18:54.702 --> 18:56.002
just the two of us?

18:56.190 --> 18:57.691
Really? What about your meetings?

18:57.744 --> 18:59.993
Ah, I'll push 'em a couple of days.

19:00.061 --> 19:01.528
What will my dad think?

19:01.829 --> 19:03.263
He won't.

19:03.564 --> 19:05.999
Our turn to keep something from him.

19:06.438 --> 19:07.934
Where do you want to go?

19:08.370 --> 19:11.271
Well, I hear there's a great
bed and breakfast in Oneonta.

19:11.465 --> 19:13.833
Oneonta? There's not much there.

19:14.114 --> 19:15.381
Exactly.

19:15.426 --> 19:19.062
Perfect place to hide and
just focus on each other.

19:19.927 --> 19:21.328
Deal.

19:21.555 --> 19:24.324
Okay, great. Let's go.

19:24.525 --> 19:25.983
Well, I'll call them from the car.

19:26.053 --> 19:27.576
Okay.

19:29.282 --> 19:30.895
You ready?

19:32.424 --> 19:34.464
_

19:34.629 --> 19:36.384
Absolutely.

19:47.180 --> 19:48.681
Where are we?

19:48.830 --> 19:50.964
Should we do this briefing
somewhere more private?

19:51.092 --> 19:52.898
I know you're talking about me.

19:53.008 --> 19:55.319
He's provided useful intel,
so I cleared him to continue.

19:55.409 --> 19:57.911
All right. Jane and Weller
are on their way back

19:57.945 --> 19:59.665
with some very upset Varnew execs.

19:59.714 --> 20:02.337
Seems like "lawsuit"
is their new favorite word.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.838
What about the field teams at
Ganzman's possible locations?

20:04.899 --> 20:07.867
The properties we've searched
so far all came up empty,

20:07.892 --> 20:09.465
but Charlie team is in the chopper

20:09.490 --> 20:11.919
on their way to Oneonta,
a friend's cabin.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.134
Ganzman spent a lot of
time at when he was younger.

20:14.159 --> 20:15.192
Kind of a long shot.

20:15.217 --> 20:17.107
We might get lucky. What's their ETA?

20:17.632 --> 20:18.757
Charlie Team,

20:18.782 --> 20:21.116
Assistant Director Reade
is requesting an ETA.

20:21.276 --> 20:23.445
<i>Charlie Team inbound to Oneonta.</i>

20:23.569 --> 20:25.944
<i>ETA to touchdown at cabin two minutes.</i>

20:26.013 --> 20:27.809
- Copy. Loop us in when you land.
- <i>Copy.</i>

20:27.834 --> 20:28.913
Are we any closer to figuring out

20:28.937 --> 20:30.149
what this weapon actually does?

20:30.174 --> 20:33.486
What part of brain ray
don't you people understand?

20:34.548 --> 20:37.517
Some of the documents Dash found

20:37.542 --> 20:40.477
allude to a full system shutdown.

20:41.295 --> 20:44.601
My guess is that it's some
version of an EMP blast,

20:44.626 --> 20:46.421
but that doesn't gel with the black box

20:46.446 --> 20:48.745
from Baxter's plane
surviving the crash.

20:48.770 --> 20:50.728
The people are the systems.

20:50.817 --> 20:53.552
It shuts down people.
It takes over their bodies.

20:53.608 --> 20:55.942
Oh, no, we get it, Dash.
It's super plausible.

20:58.599 --> 20:59.992
<i>Initiating landing.</i>

21:00.033 --> 21:02.635
<i>No sign of anyone outside the...</i>

21:03.089 --> 21:04.500
Charlie Team, say again.

21:04.525 --> 21:06.126
<i>Sorry, something's off.</i>

21:06.600 --> 21:09.696
<i>My head... My nose
is bleeding. What's...</i>

21:11.805 --> 21:13.005
Listen.

21:15.255 --> 21:17.156
Do you hear that?

21:17.464 --> 21:19.120
It's warbles.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.734
Oh, my God.

21:21.297 --> 21:22.672
Charlie Team, abort mission.

21:22.697 --> 21:24.045
Get out of there now. Do you copy?

21:24.070 --> 21:25.192
What's going on?

21:25.246 --> 21:27.500
The black box from Baxter's plane

21:27.525 --> 21:30.870
had the same static pulse and...

21:31.419 --> 21:32.919
Oh, my God, I think I know what it is.

21:33.047 --> 21:36.183
I... It's... It's not
a mind control device.

21:36.369 --> 21:40.039
Ganzman developed
a hyper-focused sonic weapon.

21:40.087 --> 21:42.389
The pilot's nose is bleeding
because sonic waves

21:42.414 --> 21:44.182
are making his brain hemorrhage.

21:44.944 --> 21:47.807
Charlie Team abort, abort!

21:47.881 --> 21:50.549
Charlie Team, come in?

21:51.311 --> 21:52.966
They just went down.

21:55.389 --> 21:58.158
This weapon is very real

21:58.473 --> 21:59.906
and very active.

22:02.151 --> 22:03.184
I gotta get out of here.

22:03.237 --> 22:05.132
- No, Dash, we need your help.
- Help?

22:05.157 --> 22:07.039
Four agents just died because of me.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.344
This isn't your fault!

22:08.369 --> 22:09.896
Oh, come on, it is.

22:10.402 --> 22:12.175
I thought this was about mind control.

22:12.249 --> 22:14.070
You guys were right. I'm... I'm crazy.

22:14.138 --> 22:16.467
No, no! You uncovered
a major conspiracy

22:16.507 --> 22:18.775
and your theory wasn't far off.

22:19.516 --> 22:22.139
You thought this weapon
controlled people

22:22.164 --> 22:23.579
through a brain ray.

22:23.732 --> 22:27.384
A sonic weapon uses
a beam of sound waves or ray

22:27.409 --> 22:28.877
to cause organ failure.

22:28.937 --> 22:30.010
It doesn't control the brain,

22:30.078 --> 22:32.120
it controls the body
by shutting it down.

22:32.207 --> 22:33.740
That sounds crazier than mind control.

22:33.765 --> 22:35.925
The military has been
using this tech on warships

22:35.950 --> 22:37.073
to defend against pirates,

22:37.098 --> 22:39.366
but Ganzman's weapon is more powerful

22:39.480 --> 22:40.613
and has greater range.

22:40.638 --> 22:42.075
Well, can't you guys just, you know,

22:42.102 --> 22:43.884
release the hounds and scoop 'em up?

22:43.992 --> 22:45.940
The hounds are already out there,

22:45.965 --> 22:47.921
but there's no sign
of him or the weapon.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.791
- We need you.
- What, me?

22:49.838 --> 22:52.194
- Yeah.
- Oh. What can I do?

22:52.354 --> 22:54.368
I need your help combing
through your research.

22:54.436 --> 22:56.537
You know your work better than anyone.

22:56.788 --> 22:59.019
Is that just a nice way to say
you can't read my handwriting?

22:59.523 --> 23:01.642
It's literally
the worst I've ever seen.

23:01.791 --> 23:04.400
Does the FBI want a lawsuit?
Is that what this is?

23:04.686 --> 23:07.047
You show up unannounced,
drag me and my employees in here

23:07.115 --> 23:10.096
without any charges,
only wild accusations...

23:10.145 --> 23:12.924
One of your engineers
just used a sonic weapon

23:13.047 --> 23:15.379
to kill four federal agents.

23:15.499 --> 23:16.761
Former engineers.

23:16.827 --> 23:18.959
We laid Michael Ganzman off last year.

23:19.195 --> 23:20.427
His project was a failure.

23:20.452 --> 23:22.141
If it's operational now,
it's news to me.

23:22.217 --> 23:24.010
He built it for your company

23:24.330 --> 23:27.201
and he's on the run,
so where would he go?

23:27.268 --> 23:28.722
Well, if I knew, I'd tell you.

23:28.768 --> 23:30.577
I have no reason to protect Ganzman.

23:30.672 --> 23:32.747
Frankly, I was happy
when we cut him loose.

23:32.867 --> 23:34.608
His salary was a crater in our budget.

23:34.842 --> 23:37.090
Looks like it still is.

23:38.277 --> 23:39.980
You're still paying Ganzman.

23:40.048 --> 23:42.197
That tells me that he's
still the head engineer

23:42.244 --> 23:44.378
of the Golden Rhino weapons program.

23:46.774 --> 23:48.942
I'd like my lawyer now.

23:52.021 --> 23:53.827
It's perfect.

23:54.170 --> 23:56.973
Hey, who knew Oneonta had the most

23:56.998 --> 23:58.951
charming bed and
breakfast in the state?

24:02.714 --> 24:04.143
- The sirens. You don't think...
- No.

24:04.220 --> 24:05.649
No, I told you, we haven't
done anything wrong.

24:05.673 --> 24:07.341
They're after Bruyere, not us.

24:07.408 --> 24:09.076
How can you be so sure?

24:09.408 --> 24:11.845
Well, the sirens are passing.

24:11.998 --> 24:14.581
There's a lot more ambulances
than cop cars.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.998
<i>We have an update on the FBI helicopter</i>

24:17.023 --> 24:19.515
<i>that crashed in the
northeastern region of Oneonta.</i>

24:19.635 --> 24:20.888
<i>Sadly, the four agents</i>

24:20.955 --> 24:22.885
<i>who were aboard the aircraft
did not survive.</i>

24:23.003 --> 24:25.037
That's awful.

24:26.857 --> 24:28.573
Actually, um, this room is starting

24:28.603 --> 24:31.472
to make me feel
a little claustrophobic.

24:31.645 --> 24:34.080
Oh, well, there's a spa
that we could explore.

24:34.105 --> 24:35.705
I'm not really in the mood.

24:35.883 --> 24:38.218
You were so gung ho about
this trip but now suddenly...

24:38.807 --> 24:40.856
Tom, what is going on?

24:44.732 --> 24:47.149
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on or not?

24:48.620 --> 24:50.684
Blake, I'm not who you think I am.

24:50.838 --> 24:53.072
Tom, why are you talking like that?

24:54.355 --> 24:57.680
My name's not Tom. It's Roman.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.661
I killed the real Tom Jakeman

25:00.728 --> 25:02.429
and assumed his identity.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.264
Then I bought my way into your world

25:04.289 --> 25:06.700
so I could take down
the Crawford empire.

25:07.623 --> 25:11.310
But then I fell in love with you

25:12.931 --> 25:15.325
and your father's vision to
make a world without borders,

25:15.350 --> 25:20.115
to build a global army beholden
to no master but peace.

25:20.782 --> 25:23.283
And now all I want is
to be a part of this family.

25:24.114 --> 25:28.661
But my old life, my old plan,
is still a threat to us.

25:28.686 --> 25:30.507
That... That helicopter crash

25:30.532 --> 25:31.954
means that the FBI is closing in

25:31.979 --> 25:33.948
on someone who could
destroy your father's life,

25:33.973 --> 25:36.041
someone who could ruin everything.

25:39.612 --> 25:42.581
I lied to you about who I am...

25:43.317 --> 25:44.984
but not how I feel about you.

25:45.992 --> 25:50.776
The man who loves you is
still standing right here,

25:51.851 --> 25:54.152
even if his name isn't Tom.

26:08.602 --> 26:09.676
Tom?

26:09.763 --> 26:10.997
Tom?

26:14.027 --> 26:16.829
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on or not?

26:19.595 --> 26:20.717
I was... I was

26:20.742 --> 26:22.643
in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.

26:23.138 --> 26:25.425
I think it's just
stirring up some memories.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.830
I'm... I'm sorry, I had no idea.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.463
Do you... Do you want to leave?

26:30.488 --> 26:33.020
No, no, this trip is about us.

26:33.719 --> 26:35.389
Maybe we could just call it
an early night, though.

26:35.413 --> 26:37.391
I think jet lag's
really messing with me.

26:37.737 --> 26:40.272
Sure. Yeah.

26:45.640 --> 26:46.907
Any progress?

26:46.975 --> 26:49.170
We've brought in
seven Varnew executives.

26:49.195 --> 26:50.734
Six of them requested counsel.

26:50.759 --> 26:51.890
Make that seven.

26:51.915 --> 26:53.754
This isn't gonna work.
We can't sort through this

26:53.779 --> 26:54.880
with lawyers and red tape.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.145
If Ganzman is connected to Crawford,

26:56.170 --> 26:57.503
then he's probably got the resources

26:57.528 --> 26:59.896
- to disappear again.
- Or be disappeared.

27:00.001 --> 27:02.305
Roman's already ahead of us.
We are so close.

27:02.330 --> 27:03.897
We can't let him slip away.

27:03.958 --> 27:06.111
Camille Moon, the CEO
Weller's been talking to,

27:06.140 --> 27:07.579
she knew Bob Drabkin,

27:07.604 --> 27:09.196
- Avery's dad.
- Wait, how do you know?

27:09.221 --> 27:12.190
Dash has the phone records
for every Varnew employee.

27:12.533 --> 27:13.680
I... No idea how.

27:13.734 --> 27:15.668
But Camille Moon made calls

27:15.696 --> 27:17.697
to a number we previously established

27:17.865 --> 27:19.332
as Drabkin's burner phone.

27:19.623 --> 27:22.024
So Avery's dad was involved
with this weapon, too.

27:22.151 --> 27:23.999
Baxter wants a demonstration,

27:24.097 --> 27:26.399
then maybe we should give him one.

27:26.506 --> 27:28.115
Have you reached out to her yet?

27:28.175 --> 27:30.152
Avery said she's only
met Moon a few times

27:30.177 --> 27:31.321
and she doesn't know her that well.

27:31.345 --> 27:32.632
We should bring her in anyway.

27:32.657 --> 27:34.611
See if she remembers anything else.

27:35.455 --> 27:38.524
Actually, I have a better idea.

27:41.928 --> 27:43.863
Funny, you don't look like my lawyer.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.365
What part of this process
don't you understand?

27:46.507 --> 27:49.571
We have someone who's
willing to cooperate with us.

27:49.596 --> 27:50.632
As soon as they give us

27:50.657 --> 27:52.564
anything we can find Ganzman with,

27:52.653 --> 27:54.192
any deal for you is off the table.

27:54.248 --> 27:56.638
I'm not doing anything
without my legal counsel.

27:56.771 --> 27:58.939
This witness is already talking.

28:04.404 --> 28:07.035
<i>Miss Drabkin, are you
absolutely certain your dad</i>

28:07.060 --> 28:09.896
<i>was involved with
a Varnew weapons project?</i>

28:09.963 --> 28:11.127
<i>I'm positive.</i>

28:11.171 --> 28:12.438
<i>Who did he work with there?</i>

28:12.480 --> 28:14.945
<i>Camille Moon, the CEO.</i>

28:15.936 --> 28:18.162
<i>Well, how did you know she was
in business with your dad?</i>

28:18.193 --> 28:21.178
<i>- Did he tell you?
- No, he never told me anything.</i>

28:21.886 --> 28:24.510
Like I said, I'll wait for my lawyer.

28:24.821 --> 28:26.131
<i>So if your dad never talked to you</i>

28:26.156 --> 28:28.549
<i>about the business
he had with Miss Moon,</i>

28:28.645 --> 28:29.912
<i>how do you know he was involved</i>

28:29.937 --> 28:31.484
<i>with the Varnew weapons project?</i>

28:31.582 --> 28:33.787
<i>My dad kept a journal on everything.</i>

28:33.924 --> 28:35.725
<i>That's how I know. Phone calls,</i>

28:35.750 --> 28:37.350
<i>appointments, meeting times.</i>

28:37.747 --> 28:39.381
<i>Camille Moon's name
is written all over it.</i>

28:39.556 --> 28:41.090
<i>Okay, where is this journal?</i>

28:41.157 --> 28:43.596
<i>- It's in my bag.
- Let's go get it.</i>

28:49.298 --> 28:51.416
Nice work. You really sold it.

28:51.528 --> 28:53.229
Now let's just hope she buys.

28:53.322 --> 28:56.215
<i>I'll let you know when
your lawyer gets here.</i>

28:57.163 --> 28:58.530
Wait!

28:59.231 --> 29:00.632
You're not gonna pin murders on me

29:00.657 --> 29:03.091
for something Ganzman did.

29:06.969 --> 29:08.705
So start talking.

29:11.167 --> 29:13.702
Drabkin wanted us to deliver
the sonic weapon to him

29:13.777 --> 29:15.144
instead of the US military.

29:15.358 --> 29:18.177
He paid me to look the
other way. I let it happen.

29:18.508 --> 29:19.908
<i>Why did Drabkin want it?</i>

29:20.196 --> 29:22.431
I don't know. He was a middleman.

29:22.733 --> 29:25.539
I just always figured he was
working for a competitor,

29:25.729 --> 29:27.296
one with very deep pockets.

29:27.343 --> 29:29.311
So any idea where Ganzman is right now?

29:29.425 --> 29:32.564
No. But I can find out.

29:33.322 --> 29:34.522
How?

29:35.292 --> 29:37.629
He's tried to call me
seven times today.

29:40.903 --> 29:41.946
Finally.

29:42.011 --> 29:43.512
<i>I've been trying to
reach you for hours.</i>

29:43.566 --> 29:45.334
Sorry, Mike, I've been in meetings.

29:45.408 --> 29:46.509
What's so urgent?

29:46.534 --> 29:47.955
- I'm in trouble.
- <i>With who?</i>

29:48.011 --> 29:49.189
With the Feds.

29:49.279 --> 29:51.467
Where are you? I'll come to you.

29:51.527 --> 29:53.662
I'm at the factory in Woodstock
where we used to test it.

29:53.929 --> 29:55.363
I'm on my way.

30:14.237 --> 30:16.409
<i>Arriving in Woodstock, New York,</i>

30:16.433 --> 30:18.446
<i>in two hours and 15 minutes.</i>

30:21.956 --> 30:23.565
We have to assume Ganzman is holed up

30:23.590 --> 30:25.891
in that factory with the sonic
weapon, so let's be cautious.

30:25.916 --> 30:27.586
I guess we can rule out
taking the chopper.

30:27.666 --> 30:29.067
You should take an armored Humvee.

30:29.129 --> 30:30.299
The heavy plating

30:30.349 --> 30:32.250
should lessen the effects
of a sonic blast.

30:32.472 --> 30:34.739
Wait, hold on. Just lessen?

30:34.807 --> 30:36.349
A sonic weapon this powerful

30:36.374 --> 30:38.052
only existed in theory until today.

30:38.077 --> 30:39.807
I don't have hard numbers
for any of this stuff.

30:39.832 --> 30:41.216
We'll work with what we've got.

30:41.241 --> 30:42.727
Now, Woodstock is
a two-hour drive away,

30:42.752 --> 30:44.173
so if we want to get ahead of Roman,

30:44.198 --> 30:46.000
we need to start moving. Let's go.

31:08.493 --> 31:09.593
<i>Hey.</i>

31:09.618 --> 31:10.752
Camille, is that you driving up.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.138
In the Humvee? Yeah, it's me.

31:13.278 --> 31:15.302
<i>All right, just stop there
and walk the rest.</i>

31:15.375 --> 31:17.504
What? No.

31:17.970 --> 31:20.672
- <i>I don't want to waste any more time.</i>
- What do we do?

31:20.733 --> 31:22.934
We just keep driving,
get as close as we can.

31:23.002 --> 31:25.521
Okay, then just stop the
truck, get out and wave first.

31:26.112 --> 31:28.480
Why? I came in this thing for a reason.

31:28.761 --> 31:30.028
I need to feel safe.

31:30.082 --> 31:31.458
<i>Well, I need to make sure
that it's you.</i>

31:31.483 --> 31:33.286
<i>It'll take one second.</i>

31:34.974 --> 31:36.676
I'm not playing games, Mike.

31:36.776 --> 31:38.910
<i>- Stop being so paranoid.
- No!</i>

31:38.991 --> 31:40.863
You have no idea what I've done, okay?

31:41.020 --> 31:42.788
<i>Just stop the truck!</i>

31:43.235 --> 31:45.979
You can tell me when I get there, okay?

31:46.719 --> 31:47.986
Mike?

31:48.120 --> 31:49.153
<i>Mike?</i>

31:49.261 --> 31:51.062
<i>Are you still there?</i>

31:51.270 --> 31:52.900
Mike?

32:08.575 --> 32:09.908
Kurt, your nose.

32:18.045 --> 32:19.811
All right, let's go! Everyone out!

32:19.859 --> 32:21.860
Wait! Get to the back of the car!

32:22.007 --> 32:23.941
- Are you guys okay?
- Barely.

32:26.893 --> 32:28.253
That thing is strong enough

32:28.277 --> 32:29.817
to break through bulletproof glass?

32:29.855 --> 32:31.445
Apparently.

32:31.837 --> 32:33.070
Patterson was right.

32:33.399 --> 32:34.996
The sonic beam can't hit us directly

32:35.027 --> 32:36.307
as long as we keep
the truck between us.

32:36.340 --> 32:38.608
Okay, but we can't
stay out here forever.

32:38.892 --> 32:40.945
No, we can't. I'm going in.

32:41.027 --> 32:43.261
<i>Weller, that would be very not good.</i>

32:43.295 --> 32:45.830
The sound waves will get
stronger the closer you get.

32:45.858 --> 32:47.116
Your heart will give out
before you make it.

32:47.140 --> 32:48.145
<i>Okay.</i>

32:48.170 --> 32:49.142
Any suggestions?

32:49.188 --> 32:51.289
Run. Run! Get out of there!

32:51.704 --> 32:53.105
<i>Shut up, Dash!</i>

32:53.265 --> 32:54.365
That's not how we do things.

32:54.674 --> 32:55.874
Okay, we gotta figure out a way

32:55.942 --> 32:57.075
to knock it out from here.

32:57.143 --> 32:58.410
<i>Jane's right.</i>

33:00.519 --> 33:03.180
When was the last time
you girls went bowling?

33:18.677 --> 33:19.877
Fan out.

33:20.552 --> 33:22.287
Find Ganzman!

33:32.698 --> 33:34.545
Mr. Ganzman.

33:34.681 --> 33:35.939
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:36.035 --> 33:37.435
Relax.

33:37.524 --> 33:38.591
I'm a friend.

33:38.925 --> 33:40.258
I'm with Hank Crawford.

33:40.386 --> 33:41.819
Oh, thank God. Okay.

33:42.093 --> 33:43.239
Okay, we gotta get out of here.

33:43.277 --> 33:45.193
- There's FBI everywhere.
- Hey, hang on, hang on.

33:45.218 --> 33:47.486
Before I get you out of here.
I just need to know one thing.

33:47.539 --> 33:49.859
The Feds traced the weapon
back to you through Varnew.

33:50.076 --> 33:51.710
Can they trace it
back to Crawford, too?

33:51.790 --> 33:53.274
- No, no, there's no way.
- There's no way?

33:53.299 --> 33:54.602
I'm positive, I'm positive, yeah.

33:54.627 --> 33:56.964
Camille Moon, our CEO,
she was paid off,

33:56.989 --> 33:58.456
but she never knew
who the weapon was for.

33:58.481 --> 34:00.782
I was the only one dealing
with Crawford's people.

34:02.029 --> 34:04.436
Wait, just wait! Wait! Just...

34:04.583 --> 34:06.501
Crawford still needs me.
He still needs me, okay?

34:06.559 --> 34:09.121
He can't... He can't pull off his plan

34:09.148 --> 34:10.675
without my technology!

34:10.868 --> 34:12.271
No!

34:13.393 --> 34:15.726
Sometimes plans change.

34:36.087 --> 34:39.326
I found Ganzman. He's dead.

34:40.166 --> 34:41.699
Roman's here.

34:57.992 --> 35:00.732
Hands!

35:01.592 --> 35:03.035
Hey, sis.

35:03.134 --> 35:05.302
Long time no see.

35:08.841 --> 35:11.821
It's good to see you again...
But I gotta run.

35:11.867 --> 35:14.674
It's over, Roman.
You're not getting out of here.

35:14.750 --> 35:17.051
Sounds like a challenge.

35:22.545 --> 35:23.912
Interesting.

35:24.246 --> 35:26.560
You're a better shot than that.

35:26.816 --> 35:28.883
If you wanted to kill me,
you could have,

35:29.004 --> 35:31.539
which means that you don't.

35:31.853 --> 35:33.987
Doesn't mean I won't if I have to.

35:41.257 --> 35:44.345
Sis, you really believe that?

35:44.752 --> 35:47.715
Even I don't believe it,
and I'm the one being shot at.

35:48.081 --> 35:50.137
Killing me would be like
killing part of yourself.

35:50.201 --> 35:52.030
Well, maybe it's the part
that needs to die.

35:52.100 --> 35:53.656
You're a monster now,

35:53.843 --> 35:55.810
and monsters needs to be put down.

36:04.059 --> 36:05.480
Goodbye, Jane.

36:11.300 --> 36:12.738
Good to know.

36:20.269 --> 36:21.928
Roman!

36:22.905 --> 36:23.905
You okay?

36:23.973 --> 36:25.273
No, I'm not. I lost him.

36:25.341 --> 36:28.209
We have to fan out.
We have to find him.

36:40.489 --> 36:42.490
Where have you been?

36:43.179 --> 36:44.687
I couldn't sleep,
so I went for a drive.

36:44.753 --> 36:46.300
For five hours?

36:46.428 --> 36:47.929
Yeah, I had a lot on my mind.

36:48.136 --> 36:49.763
Care to share?

36:59.141 --> 37:01.357
What if we just dropped
everything and...

37:01.943 --> 37:03.235
ran away together?

37:04.398 --> 37:05.947
- Tom...
- Hey, I'm serious.

37:06.015 --> 37:07.715
Some... Some paradise.

37:07.783 --> 37:09.384
Anywhere you want.

37:09.583 --> 37:11.005
Just nothing...

37:11.066 --> 37:13.393
Nothing but each other.

37:15.691 --> 37:17.757
That sounds perfect.

37:19.461 --> 37:22.153
But I like my life.

37:22.471 --> 37:24.239
I can't just leave
my friends and my family

37:24.264 --> 37:25.757
and my charity work. I can't just...

37:25.821 --> 37:27.254
No.

37:29.571 --> 37:31.366
No, of course not.

37:33.481 --> 37:35.015
You know, I can't...

37:35.127 --> 37:38.815
I can't help you if you shut me out.

37:39.615 --> 37:42.031
What do you want to run away from?

37:43.552 --> 37:46.020
- My past.
- The war is over, Tom.

37:46.088 --> 37:47.288
No, not for me.

37:47.356 --> 37:50.784
It'll always be chasing me,
trying to devour me.

37:50.985 --> 37:52.553
So don't let it.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.976
Don't look back, just look forward.

37:56.979 --> 37:58.472
I want to.

37:59.374 --> 38:01.290
I love you more than anything.

38:02.264 --> 38:03.872
You are my future.

38:05.109 --> 38:07.114
And I want to burn
my past to the ground.

38:07.176 --> 38:08.324
Then do it.

38:08.357 --> 38:11.459
Wipe it all away and if
you feel like you can't just...

38:11.484 --> 38:13.007
talk to me.

38:14.236 --> 38:16.403
You're my future, too.

38:17.469 --> 38:19.729
And when you hurt, I hurt.

38:20.916 --> 38:24.419
Look, we can beat this,
whatever this is.

38:25.232 --> 38:28.329
You are a soldier
and soldiers don't run.

38:28.697 --> 38:31.198
They stay and they fight.

38:34.235 --> 38:35.802
You're right.

38:36.991 --> 38:39.493
But first, they rest.

38:43.131 --> 38:45.147
Rest is overrated.

38:52.755 --> 38:54.655
You know, they're not gonna just visit

38:54.723 --> 38:56.991
from some distant planet, right?

38:57.187 --> 38:59.975
You know, they were born
right here on Earth.

39:00.202 --> 39:02.499
And where are these beings located?

39:02.545 --> 39:04.773
- Detroit, mostly. Yeah.
- Okay.

39:04.798 --> 39:06.667
We've found some in Buffalo.

39:06.977 --> 39:08.744
Wait, what happened? Did we win?

39:08.810 --> 39:10.144
Uh, yeah.

39:10.225 --> 39:12.026
We won, Dash, thanks to you.

39:12.207 --> 39:15.543
Now we gotta go talk
about what you saw today

39:15.568 --> 39:17.854
and how you're not gonna
tell anyone about it.

39:18.014 --> 39:20.134
This is a cover-up.
I'm part of a cover-up?

39:20.221 --> 39:22.822
You're definitely part of a cover-up.

39:25.248 --> 39:27.869
We have to thank you
for your help today, Avery.

39:27.916 --> 39:29.302
Did you find this Ganzman guy?

39:29.389 --> 39:32.360
We did, but Roman found him first.

39:32.428 --> 39:33.628
What about Crawford?

39:33.695 --> 39:35.129
Can you connect him to this weapon,

39:35.197 --> 39:36.330
use it to take him down?

39:36.398 --> 39:38.894
We think that Ganzman
was the only link.

39:39.088 --> 39:40.614
That's why Roman killed him.

39:40.702 --> 39:42.120
So they beat us again.

39:42.211 --> 39:45.826
We stopped Crawford from getting
an extremely dangerous weapon.

39:46.099 --> 39:48.476
Whatever he needed it for,
that's off the table now.

39:48.544 --> 39:49.710
Jane's right.

39:49.778 --> 39:52.880
This is a huge dent in his plan.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.949
Not that we know what that is yet.

39:56.685 --> 39:58.758
Look, we know that this has been hard,

39:58.964 --> 40:00.388
and being stuck in that safe house

40:00.413 --> 40:04.037
isn't making it any easier, so...

40:05.387 --> 40:07.335
would you like to move in with us?

40:07.983 --> 40:10.163
We understand if you don't.

40:10.372 --> 40:12.943
You know, it might be nice
for you to have some freedom

40:12.968 --> 40:16.604
and, you know,
some really great company.

40:17.389 --> 40:19.593
You'd ditch my security detail?

40:19.618 --> 40:20.787
No, we won't.

40:20.836 --> 40:22.737
They would be stationed
outside on the street.

40:22.825 --> 40:24.826
It's the best we can do right now.

40:26.781 --> 40:28.349
Okay.

40:28.576 --> 40:30.929
- Yeah, I'd like that.
- Really?

40:30.979 --> 40:33.372
You're welcome to stay
for as long as you want,

40:33.397 --> 40:34.918
and once we take Roman down,

40:34.963 --> 40:37.064
then you're free to go
wherever you want.

40:37.186 --> 40:38.348
If we take Roman down.

40:38.373 --> 40:39.807
It's just a matter of time.

40:40.014 --> 40:41.915
I saw the look in his eyes today.

40:42.283 --> 40:44.951
He's scrambling and he knows it.

41:12.380 --> 41:13.847
You need help cleaning up?

41:14.282 --> 41:16.183
Uh... No, thanks.

41:16.767 --> 41:18.165
We're almost done, anyway.

41:18.585 --> 41:19.640
Yeah.

41:21.654 --> 41:22.803
Tattoo hit.

41:22.871 --> 41:24.109
Yeah.

41:25.827 --> 41:27.428
It's the koi fish.

41:27.503 --> 41:29.078
Let's see what my database found.

41:31.784 --> 41:34.187
Uh, that's weird.

41:36.731 --> 41:38.799
50 hits on the same tattoo.

41:40.308 --> 41:42.576
Whoa. I'm getting hits
on a bunch of tattoos,

41:42.623 --> 41:45.025
hundreds of them, including
ones we've already solved.

41:45.294 --> 41:46.694
What the hell is happening?

41:46.762 --> 41:48.535
The Internet's being
flooded with information,

41:48.560 --> 41:50.112
triggering every tattoo at once.

41:50.165 --> 41:51.666
There's 600 now.

41:52.126 --> 41:55.195
2,000. 5,000.

41:55.711 --> 41:56.944
It's Roman.

41:56.998 --> 41:59.940
He's flooding the database
with false positives,

42:00.434 --> 42:03.537
covering Crawford's tracks and now his.

42:04.432 --> 42:06.967
We're operating completely in the dark.
