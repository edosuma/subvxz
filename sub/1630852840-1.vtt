WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:04.370
MANY YEARS AGO,
BEFORE THE GREEKS AND ROMANS,

00:04.450 --> 00:06.250
MAN AND BEAST WERE ONE,

00:06.330 --> 00:09.330
AND THE REAL AND FANTASTIC MERGED.

00:09.420 --> 00:11.880
LAVISH MYTHS OF OLD WERE INVENTED,

00:11.960 --> 00:15.090
BASED ON MORALS
THAT ARE NO LONGER OUR OWN.

00:17.010 --> 00:20.090
FOR GÉRARD BRACH

01:02.970 --> 01:05.930
LONG BEFORE HOMER'S TIME…

01:08.430 --> 01:11.940
…SOMEWHERE IN THE AGEAN SEA

01:42.130 --> 01:46.510
Come on! Hey! Come on!

01:49.100 --> 01:51.810
Hurry up! Come on!

01:51.890 --> 01:53.810
Go! Come on!

02:28.350 --> 02:31.100
Welcome, immaculate goddesses,

02:31.390 --> 02:33.430
bearers of bright omens,

02:33.520 --> 02:37.690
messengers of joy, abundant harvests
and fertility.

02:44.650 --> 02:48.570
<i>Oh, how sweet it is</i>
<i>To know that you are loved!</i>

02:48.990 --> 02:54.500
<i>Oh, how deep is the abyss of life</i>

03:25.900 --> 03:30.740
<i>Oh, how deep is the abyss of life!</i>

03:42.960 --> 03:46.930
Every morning, Clytia, your beauty
makes the world more beautiful.

03:47.340 --> 03:49.340
My heart rejoices, Karkos,

03:49.430 --> 03:52.680
because every day brings us closer
to our long-awaited union.

03:52.930 --> 03:53.970
Yes.

04:19.420 --> 04:21.420
Minor, go away.

04:22.710 --> 04:23.630
Go on!

04:24.090 --> 04:26.880
Go on Minor, scram! Go away!

04:46.030 --> 04:48.360
Minor, what did I say? Scram!

05:16.600 --> 05:19.890
More sacred doves have arrived.
The year will be blessed, my husband!

05:20.350 --> 05:22.770
You're the one who's blessed, my dove.
All over!

05:27.400 --> 05:31.400
INNOCENT PRANKS
LEAD TO UNIMAGINABLE TURMOIL

06:22.330 --> 06:24.120
Stop, Minor!

06:24.210 --> 06:26.880
He bit me! Catch him!

06:28.750 --> 06:30.130
The pig bit me!

06:30.210 --> 06:31.670
He bit a chunk out of me!

06:31.760 --> 06:33.720
-What's going on?
-He bit me!

06:33.800 --> 06:35.760
The pig's bitten the butcher's wife!

06:35.840 --> 06:36.840
He's bitten my Zima!

06:36.930 --> 06:40.060
The pig's bitten my Zima!

06:40.140 --> 06:41.640
-Catch him!
-He bit me!

06:43.480 --> 06:45.600
It is forbidden to climb the sacred tree!

06:45.690 --> 06:48.560
-Sacrilege!
-Get down! Kill him!

06:50.400 --> 06:54.610
Heathen!

06:56.860 --> 06:57.780
Slaughter him!

06:57.870 --> 07:01.240
Silence! What's going on?

07:01.330 --> 07:02.910
Who's in the sacred tree?

07:03.000 --> 07:06.620
The pig man, Venerable Archeo.
The unspeakable rot of the pigsty.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.000
-Kill him!
-He's rabid!

07:08.080 --> 07:10.040
Get rid of him!

07:10.130 --> 07:12.130
Kill the heathen!

07:12.210 --> 07:14.510
Kill him!

07:14.590 --> 07:16.840
Let us not repeat
the mistakes of the past.

07:16.930 --> 07:18.640
No sacrifice without a trial!

07:18.720 --> 07:20.970
With all due respect, my elder,

07:21.060 --> 07:24.310
a trial has no value
if the defendant can't speak.

07:24.390 --> 07:26.730
-Someone will speak for him.
-Me!

07:28.020 --> 07:30.980
You, Clytia? You, my daughter?

07:31.070 --> 07:33.530
Yes, Father. Me!

07:34.650 --> 07:35.950
Come on, you moron!

07:36.030 --> 07:38.740
Don't move! Understand?

07:39.280 --> 07:40.280
Silence!

07:43.410 --> 07:49.080
Kinéma, tell us where Minor came from.

07:55.550 --> 07:57.010
It came upon

07:57.090 --> 08:02.720
a windless night,
when the owls howled like wolves.

08:02.810 --> 08:06.390
Remember… Close your eyes!

08:06.640 --> 08:09.150
Turn your eyes inward!

08:09.980 --> 08:14.020
See the shadows of that cursed day

08:14.110 --> 08:17.240
flash across the walls of your skull.

08:22.370 --> 08:24.290
<i>The sun is rising.</i>

08:24.370 --> 08:29.120
<i>The sea is blood red</i>
<i>beneath the fiery sky.</i>

08:30.170 --> 08:34.300
<i>See the strange boat smashed on the shore.</i>

08:36.510 --> 08:38.880
<i>See the dead young woman</i>

08:38.970 --> 08:43.470
<i>clutching a newborn,</i>
<i>suckling on her lifeless breast.</i>

08:45.060 --> 08:47.020
<i>I took the baby.</i>

08:47.100 --> 08:50.440
<i>I nursed him until that evening,</i>

08:50.520 --> 08:55.020
<i>when he bit me so savagely that</i>
<i>he bit off my nipple and swallowed it!</i>

08:57.030 --> 09:01.110
It was him! That day,
my milk turned black and fetid.

09:01.610 --> 09:04.280
The elders already know that vile story!

09:04.370 --> 09:05.870
It would make a toad vomit!

09:05.950 --> 09:08.250
-He went to live with the pigs.
-We know all this.

09:08.330 --> 09:13.000
He was nursed by a sow.
He learned to grunt, but never spoke!

09:13.500 --> 09:16.170
Minor bit again this morning.

09:16.460 --> 09:18.380
Zima, show us your violated flesh!

09:26.680 --> 09:28.390
-They've already seen it!
-So?

09:28.470 --> 09:30.180
Slaughter him! Death to the beast!

09:30.270 --> 09:31.690
Kill him!

09:32.190 --> 09:33.850
Kill him!

09:34.520 --> 09:36.520
-He's not from here!
-Really!

09:36.610 --> 09:40.030
A foreigner who barely speaks our language

09:40.110 --> 09:42.110
isn't going to tell us what…
what you must…

09:42.200 --> 09:43.200
what we have to do!

09:43.280 --> 09:44.570
This is my defense!

09:44.660 --> 09:48.080
The dove tree must not be desecrated!

09:48.160 --> 09:49.750
That's right, if I may!

09:49.830 --> 09:51.790
This is my defense!

09:55.710 --> 09:58.210
Minor was trying to save his own life.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.550
Well, yeah, but…

09:59.630 --> 10:03.630
He followed his instinct to find refuge.

10:04.510 --> 10:05.890
You'd put instinct on trial?

10:06.350 --> 10:10.270
Well, maybe not. But kill him
and then we can talk about it.

10:10.350 --> 10:15.940
We don't know which part of Minor is human

10:16.020 --> 10:18.940
and which part is porcine.

10:19.440 --> 10:22.650
So we risk cannibalism if we eat him.

10:23.070 --> 10:25.240
We don't have to eat him to kill him.

10:25.490 --> 10:27.950
We could just gouge his eyes out…

10:28.030 --> 10:30.410
Gouge his eyes, cut off his hands…

10:30.500 --> 10:31.870
Thank you, I just said that!

10:31.950 --> 10:33.000
He just said it.

10:33.080 --> 10:37.630
In his most intimate moments,
he seems neither good,

10:39.170 --> 10:40.460
nor bad.

10:41.050 --> 10:43.260
He seems to be just like each of us.

10:43.340 --> 10:45.090
Stop with your lewd poses!

10:45.180 --> 10:46.340
She's turning us on!

10:46.640 --> 10:48.720
I know, I know! It's her eloquence!

10:48.800 --> 10:50.560
Nothing else. That's my daughter!

10:50.640 --> 10:51.890
You call that eloquence?

10:51.970 --> 10:56.480
Clytia, my dear, go on!

10:56.560 --> 10:58.520
What were you saying with your breasts?

10:58.860 --> 11:03.400
Minor can be as gallant as a man.
He gave me truffles.

11:03.490 --> 11:05.820
Ah! Corruption! Corruption of the court!

11:05.910 --> 11:07.950
Which only he can find,

11:08.030 --> 11:09.700
thanks to his nose.

11:09.780 --> 11:12.040
His nose? That just proves he's not human!

11:12.120 --> 11:13.370
Silence!

11:13.910 --> 11:17.960
Silence! Or I'll empty the chamber!

11:19.040 --> 11:21.500
The desecration of the dove tree
was not deliberate

11:21.590 --> 11:23.460
in the opinion of the court.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.470
What?

11:24.550 --> 11:28.050
The accused is ordered
to stand like a scarecrow

11:28.140 --> 11:29.720
until the olive harvest.

11:29.800 --> 11:30.640
That's it?

11:30.720 --> 11:33.850
If he bites again before then,
to the slaughterhouse!

11:34.520 --> 11:35.350
That's that!

11:35.440 --> 11:37.350
That girl really is very good.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.150
She's my future daughter-in-law.

11:39.230 --> 11:40.110
Ah, yes!

11:40.190 --> 11:41.820
Twirling around like that…

11:42.360 --> 11:44.780
Isn't justice beautiful?

11:49.950 --> 11:54.040
My wisdom is the fruit of years
that have turned my beard white as snow,

11:54.120 --> 11:57.960
but my daughter, my wisdom was dazzled
by your defense!

11:58.420 --> 12:01.710
It was breathtaking! Brilliant!

12:02.380 --> 12:04.880
Come here. Give me a hug.

12:06.260 --> 12:10.640
You instinctively combined
the melodious spell of rhetoric

12:10.720 --> 12:14.970
with the eloquence of your sublime figure.

12:15.060 --> 12:16.640
Didn't she, Karkos?

12:16.730 --> 12:18.020
She certainly did!

12:18.850 --> 12:21.560
Father, may I be excused?
I need to freshen up.

12:21.650 --> 12:23.440
Yes, my dear. Off you go.

12:25.190 --> 12:26.990
She's marvelous.

12:27.950 --> 12:33.780
To be honest, when Clytia
exposed her breasts to the crowd,

12:35.410 --> 12:39.160
I was embarrassed. I blushed.

12:39.580 --> 12:41.830
Why would you blush, if not from pleasure?

12:42.250 --> 12:45.550
All those unchaste eyes staring at her,

12:46.670 --> 12:50.890
her sensual gazes, those overt erections.

12:50.970 --> 12:53.050
-They made me suffer.
-Are you jealous?

12:54.180 --> 12:55.850
Being jealous of Clytia

12:56.680 --> 12:59.940
is as absurd as being jealous
of the virgin whiteness of a lily.

13:00.900 --> 13:03.940
Listen. Don't treat Clytia like a goddess.

13:04.230 --> 13:06.900
She's a human being, Karkos, like you.

13:06.980 --> 13:11.780
She's warm-blooded. Her body is ready for
the embrace that will make her a woman.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.870
Loving her too much
is the wrong way to love her.

13:35.470 --> 13:40.730
MINOR DISCOVERS A MYTHICAL FOREST
AND LEARNS THE PAGAN WAYS

15:19.280 --> 15:21.080
What are you doing here?

15:25.670 --> 15:27.500
What? I don't understand your language.

15:30.590 --> 15:33.170
Oh, those nymphs, those nymphs!

15:33.920 --> 15:36.180
I desire them more than anything.

15:36.260 --> 15:41.430
I long to visit their virginal fragility,

15:41.850 --> 15:44.810
and give them a taste of a goat's ardor.

15:53.730 --> 15:54.940
That's my nature.

15:55.030 --> 15:59.320
My name is Pan, but I prefer Satyr.

15:59.410 --> 16:01.030
Proud to be one.

16:03.290 --> 16:07.210
Stop looking at me like a moron
and make yourself useful.

16:07.670 --> 16:11.840
Clean the crud off my hooves. Here.

17:00.340 --> 17:03.180
Hang on. How did you get here?
You're mortal.

17:03.470 --> 17:04.930
Are you an archeologist?

17:05.350 --> 17:06.850
Tell me!

17:06.930 --> 17:09.100
Tell me!

17:09.180 --> 17:12.020
You can't get away!

18:31.770 --> 18:36.270
Cataractos! You're picking up goat turds.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.520
Oh, how wicked is nature!

18:39.610 --> 18:41.570
How do you tell the difference?

18:41.650 --> 18:44.610
Just bite into it.
If there's a pit, then it's an olive.

18:58.540 --> 19:00.840
This is a good spot to sit.

19:00.920 --> 19:01.800
Okay.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.050
I know that tune.

19:42.050 --> 19:43.050
Yeah?

19:43.340 --> 19:45.550
"Your skin is as soft as a rose petal."

19:45.840 --> 19:46.760
That's right!

19:49.640 --> 19:51.310
Pluck me, Karkos!

19:56.560 --> 19:58.690
Let's wait for the sacred day
of our union.

19:59.690 --> 20:02.110
-Will that day ever come?
-Yes!

20:03.400 --> 20:06.400
The gods know when it's best, Clytia.

20:06.490 --> 20:09.110
Let's wait for the oracles.

20:09.610 --> 20:12.330
But do we have to wait all the time?

20:12.410 --> 20:13.330
Yes.

20:13.410 --> 20:14.740
Karkos!

20:29.970 --> 20:32.010
You smashed yourself up before I did it.

20:33.470 --> 20:34.850
-Hey!
-I think he's dead!

20:35.270 --> 20:36.810
Look, Karkos. He's bleeding!

20:36.890 --> 20:37.810
He's bleeding?

20:38.310 --> 20:39.600
He's not breathing.

20:40.560 --> 20:43.150
The poor creature has been freed
from his pitiful fate.

20:43.230 --> 20:44.940
Go and tell the others, please.

20:47.110 --> 20:47.950
Okay.

20:50.030 --> 20:51.120
I'll be right back.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.660
What's happening?

20:56.750 --> 20:59.750
Minor fell and hit his head on a rock.

20:59.830 --> 21:01.630
I loved the way you adored me.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.800
The innocent way you showed your desire.

21:12.930 --> 21:15.720
I'm sorry if I was ever mean to you.

21:25.190 --> 21:27.690
What a harvest!

21:39.790 --> 21:40.960
On the pile of manure!

21:45.590 --> 21:47.130
Go on.

22:03.560 --> 22:06.730
What a great day! What a harvest!

22:11.320 --> 22:14.200
I roasted it on the fire
and basted it in honey,

22:14.280 --> 22:16.620
just as you like it, sire.

22:18.990 --> 22:20.330
An ear for me, son.

22:20.410 --> 22:23.750
-Karkos, give me a bit of cheek.
-Minor came from the darkness…

22:23.830 --> 22:24.670
Oh no, not again.

22:24.750 --> 22:27.380
To the darkness, he must return!

22:27.460 --> 22:30.050
Or have mercy on our souls!

22:30.130 --> 22:32.420
-We'll do it in the morning!
-Have mercy on us!

22:32.510 --> 22:35.970
-Stop rattling on!
-Listen! Close your eyes.

22:36.050 --> 22:37.970
Turn your eyes inward.

22:38.350 --> 22:41.020
We can't turn our eyes inward
when we're eating!

22:41.100 --> 22:42.520
Enough!

22:42.600 --> 22:43.850
-Tomorrow will be too late.
-Enough, old owl!

22:44.230 --> 22:47.730
That's enough!

23:41.370 --> 23:43.450
Know your…

23:46.420 --> 23:47.580
Know…

23:50.500 --> 23:52.500
Know thyself…

23:58.180 --> 24:00.260
He was dead! What's going on!

24:00.350 --> 24:02.600
-Where is he?
-Well, he's not here, anyway!

24:02.680 --> 24:05.100
What if his spirit
is spying on us in the fog?

24:09.150 --> 24:11.020
I warned them!

24:11.110 --> 24:14.070
We chucked him on there.
He can't have just disappeared!

24:15.740 --> 24:17.030
There!

24:20.070 --> 24:21.120
But…

24:22.410 --> 24:23.660
Hi, there!

24:25.290 --> 24:26.460
You're not dead?

24:26.540 --> 24:28.670
Even better. I'm alive.

24:29.620 --> 24:32.290
Don't be afraid! It's me, Minor!

24:33.250 --> 24:34.750
-He's talking!
-Well, yeah.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.010
You're talking?

24:36.510 --> 24:38.130
And I can "think" too!

24:39.760 --> 24:41.760
Here comes trouble.

24:43.470 --> 24:45.600
So much has changed since yesterday.

24:46.390 --> 24:49.640
Yesterday seems like 100 years ago.

24:51.230 --> 24:52.520
Like you understand.

24:54.230 --> 24:55.480
You understand me?

24:56.400 --> 24:58.860
Really?

24:59.200 --> 25:02.280
No, my feelings haven't changed.
They're just different!

25:06.080 --> 25:09.370
All men get a hard-on when they look
at the Patriarch's daughter.

25:09.460 --> 25:12.170
I'm a man, a normal man.

25:12.710 --> 25:15.300
That's all!

25:15.380 --> 25:17.630
What do you expect, fatty? It's true!

25:17.710 --> 25:19.220
That's right.

25:21.130 --> 25:25.220
No, I was teasing! I was teasing!

25:25.310 --> 25:29.060
You've got to admit, though,
you have put on a bit of weight.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.650
And oh, I almost forgot!

25:34.230 --> 25:37.230
I'm not thinking straight
after today's events.

25:37.320 --> 25:38.530
Just above the swamp,

25:38.610 --> 25:41.030
I met a creature
who was half-goat, half-human.

25:41.110 --> 25:42.860
His name is Pan. It suits him.

25:42.950 --> 25:45.160
Anyway, he prefers to be called Satyr.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.870
I tried to get away
but ended with my ass in the air.

25:48.410 --> 25:49.910
And that bugger took advantage

25:50.000 --> 25:53.080
to make me feel his phallus
in a very unique way

25:53.170 --> 25:54.710
that I couldn't have imagined.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.340
Yes, he entered the passage. Exactly.

26:00.380 --> 26:02.130
"Sodomy?" Never heard of it.

26:02.220 --> 26:06.810
Anyway, that Pan had a massive phallus
and balls to match.

26:11.440 --> 26:14.100
-Who's there?
-Madam Zima.

26:16.060 --> 26:18.360
-What is it?
-It's a surprise.

26:22.070 --> 26:23.820
Come back later. I'm thinking.

26:24.360 --> 26:25.870
Open up! It's me, Clytia.

26:28.950 --> 26:30.700
Your lawyer.

26:32.710 --> 26:33.710
Open up!

26:38.380 --> 26:41.510
Hello, ma'am. Hello, sir.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.850
These are gifts from my father,
our Patriarch.

26:47.510 --> 26:49.850
His best mead. It's alcoholic honey.

26:49.930 --> 26:53.480
And I brought you an extra toga.

26:53.560 --> 26:56.270
You'll see,
it's really soft against the skin.

26:56.360 --> 27:00.980
And a bit of lavender, for bathing.

27:02.070 --> 27:04.820
Here you go.

27:05.070 --> 27:07.740
And a bale of fresh hay.

27:08.620 --> 27:13.120
Put it down there. And get out of here.

27:15.330 --> 27:17.210
Go on, hurry up.

27:17.290 --> 27:19.960
Please thank the Patriarch on my behalf.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.670
On our behalf.

27:22.050 --> 27:22.960
Yes.

27:24.380 --> 27:26.970
Do you need anything else?

27:30.140 --> 27:31.180
Not for now.

27:32.060 --> 27:36.140
Right. Well… good night, then.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.200
-Well?
-He didn't say yet.

27:54.700 --> 27:59.130
A DRUNK MINOR HAS A DIVINE MEETING
AND GETS EVEN DRUNKER

28:17.310 --> 28:19.480
Hey. It smells in here, doesn't it?

28:21.520 --> 28:25.530
It ruins the taste of the mead.

28:29.490 --> 28:32.620
I'm going to go for a walk
because it stinks in here.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.680
What a beautiful night.

28:58.270 --> 29:01.190
Yo, olive tree!

29:02.810 --> 29:06.740
I recognize you! This is where I died!

29:17.830 --> 29:22.540
Do my eyes deceive me
or do I see what I see?

29:23.040 --> 29:24.040
What do you see?

29:24.790 --> 29:26.340
I don't know what to call it.

29:28.380 --> 29:31.340
I'd have to be a poet, and I'm not.

29:32.260 --> 29:34.600
-Who are you?
-I'm me.

29:34.680 --> 29:37.310
Take off your mask
and let me see your face.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.810
I have no intention of doing that.

29:39.890 --> 29:41.060
It's what I desire.

29:41.140 --> 29:43.230
Your desire as a mere mortal is not mine.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.730
Do you cover your face in a golden mask
because it is ugly?

29:46.820 --> 29:49.070
How dare you! Insolent man!

29:49.780 --> 29:50.950
No, Golden Mask!

29:51.490 --> 29:53.160
It was a slip of the tongue!

29:53.240 --> 29:55.370
I'm not used to using my tongue.

29:55.450 --> 29:56.740
I beg you, gentle goddess!

29:56.830 --> 29:58.870
Turn around. Look at me repenting!

29:58.950 --> 30:01.460
I submit to the enigma of your beauty
and its law.

31:56.700 --> 31:59.200
Is this the feeling humans call love?

32:01.450 --> 32:02.990
I am suffocating in love…

32:54.340 --> 32:59.380
Prunios, innocent girl…

33:00.340 --> 33:05.680
Oh, pure one, fill the cup

33:06.140 --> 33:08.640
with your virgin liquor.

33:09.980 --> 33:11.560
I don't have any virgin liquor.

33:11.810 --> 33:13.190
Pee in the cup!

33:15.440 --> 33:17.190
No, you! You pee!

33:17.280 --> 33:18.990
-Me?
-Yes.

33:19.490 --> 33:20.700
-Do it.
-Go on!

33:27.450 --> 33:28.660
There.

33:42.590 --> 33:46.060
I see… Goodness me!

33:46.680 --> 33:47.810
What do you see?

33:47.890 --> 33:52.480
I see that Minor's head is full!

33:52.560 --> 33:54.190
-Full of what?
-Full of what?

33:54.560 --> 33:55.730
Doves!

33:55.820 --> 33:58.690
Doves don't live in a pig's head!

33:58.780 --> 34:00.150
I saw it clearly!

34:00.240 --> 34:02.030
Clearly? You're blind as a bat.

34:02.360 --> 34:03.820
You know who you're talking to?

34:03.910 --> 34:07.830
Yeah, the man who squeezed a chick
the other day, thinking…

34:07.910 --> 34:09.290
-Enough!
-It was a lemon!

34:09.370 --> 34:10.200
Enough!

34:10.290 --> 34:11.830
-There.
-I thought it was an orange.

34:11.920 --> 34:15.210
-A lemon!
-This is no time to quarrel.

34:16.090 --> 34:19.710
The prophecy is unfolding as we feared.

34:21.170 --> 34:23.510
We have to act, now!

34:24.050 --> 34:28.350
A STRAY DOVE
CHANGES THE PATH OF DESTINY

34:36.190 --> 34:37.980
I can't get used to it.

34:38.070 --> 34:39.480
You'll have to.

34:39.570 --> 34:44.450
Only a wicked alliance
could make a pig-man become a man.

34:45.240 --> 34:46.200
A man or a demon.

34:46.490 --> 34:49.290
They say he fornicates with that sow.

34:49.370 --> 34:52.160
Once a pig, always a pig.

34:52.710 --> 34:54.000
Are you talking about me?

34:54.290 --> 34:57.130
What are you whispering about over there?

34:57.750 --> 34:58.710
Go on, brother.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.550
Go on. You're our leader!

35:01.670 --> 35:06.340
We were talking about celebrating
your arrival among us,

35:06.430 --> 35:09.600
and the immense joy
your metamorphosis brings.

35:10.890 --> 35:12.350
I'm still who I always was.

35:12.430 --> 35:13.270
Right.

35:13.350 --> 35:16.400
It's just the words stayed in… oh!

35:18.060 --> 35:22.110
The words stayed in my head, tangled,

35:22.190 --> 35:25.280
stuck inside my skull,
where words wait to be said.

35:26.410 --> 35:29.620
Come closer, my fellow men! My people!

35:29.910 --> 35:35.080
Look! We're all brothers.
From the front and from the back.

36:30.470 --> 36:32.010
What's that?

36:42.230 --> 36:46.320
My goodness! It's a sign!

36:51.410 --> 36:52.580
Go!

36:54.910 --> 36:55.950
No, no, it's not…

36:56.040 --> 36:58.370
It's not the… It's not for…

37:02.880 --> 37:04.800
Well, there it is.

38:04.190 --> 38:07.530
Hey!

38:10.190 --> 38:13.160
Well, hello there!
Have you come for your sodomy?

38:14.240 --> 38:16.780
No, for advice.

38:17.450 --> 38:18.700
You can have both.

38:20.540 --> 38:21.580
I'm a king.

38:22.250 --> 38:23.710
He speaks! King of what?

38:24.250 --> 38:26.750
The island. This island, where we are.

38:27.420 --> 38:30.550
I'm not on an island.
Neither are my people.

38:30.630 --> 38:32.550
We are everywhere. The myths decide.

38:33.300 --> 38:38.510
Oh. So the myths decided
you should sodomize me?

38:38.810 --> 38:40.220
No, that was me.

38:41.060 --> 38:44.230
Scratch my back, Your Majesty.
I have fleas.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.980
Go on, harder… Your Majesty.

38:50.070 --> 38:51.570
You smell good.

38:51.650 --> 38:53.570
I smell like goat.

38:53.990 --> 38:55.780
-Satyr?
-Yeah.

38:56.490 --> 38:58.370
-Now that I'm a king…
-Hmm?

38:58.450 --> 39:00.080
-What do I have to do?
-Nothing.

39:00.160 --> 39:03.580
Others do it all for you,
except if they can't, obviously,

39:03.660 --> 39:06.750
like sleeping,
or answering the call of nature.

39:06.830 --> 39:08.420
Stop scratching.

39:08.960 --> 39:12.300
Or fornicating with their wives
who you've taken as your mistresses.

39:12.380 --> 39:14.340
Be adored. That's your job.

39:14.430 --> 39:18.680
Make your people construct great,
useless buildings.

39:18.760 --> 39:21.600
Tear them apart, impale them.
Or if you prefer,

39:21.680 --> 39:24.190
you can immerse yourself
in lavish debauchery.

39:24.270 --> 39:26.350
Know what I mean, Your Majesty?

39:27.480 --> 39:30.070
Satyr, I love Clytia,
the Patriarch's daughter.

39:30.150 --> 39:32.360
She was my lawyer. I saw her breasts.

39:32.860 --> 39:37.070
But she is betrothed to Karkos,
a superb athlete.

39:37.160 --> 39:39.410
Clytia, I love you!

39:39.490 --> 39:41.330
Introduce her to your associate.

39:41.910 --> 39:42.790
My associate?

39:42.870 --> 39:46.250
Your Majesty,
the mandrel between your legs!

39:46.330 --> 39:49.420
Say it can't live without her,
it's wasting away, it's in pain.

39:49.540 --> 39:51.500
You'll see. Women have a lot of heart.

39:52.760 --> 39:57.050
See that young lady over there?

39:57.140 --> 39:59.300
Well, thanks to him, since last night,

39:59.390 --> 40:02.600
it's in the bag, in a manner of speaking.

40:06.230 --> 40:08.060
Is your hairstyle a new trend?

40:08.560 --> 40:10.980
No, it's a sacred dove's nest.

40:15.240 --> 40:17.070
Hey, Dada!

40:18.450 --> 40:20.240
Right. I've got to go see Dionysus

40:20.320 --> 40:23.240
about the bacchanalian solstice.
Orgies and depravity until dawn!

40:23.620 --> 40:24.950
I'll introduce you to him.

40:25.410 --> 40:26.660
Give me a hug.

40:30.130 --> 40:32.460
This is my friend Centaur!

40:33.050 --> 40:34.300
Be careful.

40:36.550 --> 40:38.550
He likes his meat bloody.

40:39.970 --> 40:41.720
Let's go, Dada. Let's go!

40:48.850 --> 40:51.060
Climb aboard, girl. Let's go.

40:51.150 --> 40:52.190
Oh, it's hard!

41:03.370 --> 41:07.580
POWER COMES WITH SURPRISES
AND SOME DRAWBACKS

41:10.830 --> 41:15.050
Little truffles!

41:32.100 --> 41:34.650
You know, my tree friend,

41:36.230 --> 41:38.360
before I awoke in your arms the other day,

41:39.450 --> 41:41.360
a goddess appeared to me in my dreams.

41:43.410 --> 41:45.990
Was she wearing a golden mask?

41:46.290 --> 41:47.450
You saw her?

41:49.000 --> 41:50.500
Is it me you seek?

41:54.750 --> 41:57.170
If endless hoping means seeking,

41:59.420 --> 42:03.180
then yes, it is you I seek.

42:03.640 --> 42:08.060
You dared to chop down my sacred tree
to make a bed for yourself.

42:08.930 --> 42:11.730
Goddess, I followed the advice of Rectus,
your priest,

42:11.810 --> 42:14.020
since your holy doves are on my head.

42:14.100 --> 42:16.770
You did not consult the Patriarch.
He is angered.

42:16.860 --> 42:18.570
He hasn't said anything to me.

42:18.650 --> 42:21.280
They say his daughter…
What's her name, again?

42:21.360 --> 42:23.740
Clytia. Her name is Clytia.

42:23.820 --> 42:27.330
They say Clytia
does not leave you indifferent.

42:27.410 --> 42:31.210
I would give my life for her,
my eyes, my blood.

42:31.660 --> 42:35.420
I am a woman too.
Would you like to see my face?

42:38.210 --> 42:39.420
Any man would.

42:39.510 --> 42:41.720
If you find me more beautiful than Clytia,

42:41.800 --> 42:44.590
I want you to swear
you'll prefer me over her.

42:44.890 --> 42:46.930
I take that oath without fear.

42:48.720 --> 42:50.640
No one could be more beautiful!

42:50.720 --> 42:52.100
Come closer!

42:52.940 --> 42:54.310
Take it off.

43:04.780 --> 43:07.620
Hiya! Am I prettier
than the Patriarch's daughter?

43:08.950 --> 43:14.120
Oh, you! My goddess, my virgin, my folly!

43:14.210 --> 43:17.290
You, my king, my hero, my pig!

43:31.060 --> 43:32.140
Who spoke?

43:33.810 --> 43:34.810
Who?

43:38.270 --> 43:41.650
My conscience!
What are you doing in my latrine?

43:41.980 --> 43:44.610
I've been constipated for three weeks!

43:44.700 --> 43:46.280
You should know!

43:56.460 --> 44:01.590
These insects with laxative properties
will do me a world of good.

44:04.920 --> 44:09.090
Oh, gentle fireflies, friendly lanterns…

44:09.180 --> 44:12.350
May your light be a guide

44:12.430 --> 44:16.690
to my petrified droppings,
trapped in my bowels.

44:20.060 --> 44:22.730
Keep quiet.

44:25.610 --> 44:27.110
-Your Majesty?
-Yes.

44:28.610 --> 44:30.780
-May I ask a favor of you?
-Of course.

44:30.870 --> 44:32.490
Slit your sow's throat.

45:02.980 --> 45:05.110
It's not the same as with a sow!

45:07.570 --> 45:10.610
I forbid you to peddle
that kind of slander.

45:12.240 --> 45:14.740
Who's best at coitus?

45:14.830 --> 45:16.370
Clytia or Golden Mask?

45:17.160 --> 45:21.250
Hush! I will not respond
to such vulgarity!

45:22.250 --> 45:23.840
Although…

45:25.420 --> 45:28.510
You've become
the Patriarch's daughter's lover!

45:33.350 --> 45:34.180
So?

45:34.470 --> 45:38.020
So we'll have to slaughter the sow.

45:38.640 --> 45:40.060
That's her fate, isn't it?

45:41.140 --> 45:43.980
The one that we men reserve for pigs.

45:46.650 --> 45:47.990
My man!

46:10.470 --> 46:11.430
That's my bed!

46:12.340 --> 46:13.930
Hey!

46:14.010 --> 46:16.140
Go on, get out. This isn't a pigsty!

46:16.680 --> 46:18.430
Get the hell out!

46:19.020 --> 46:21.640
Out. Right now. Get out of here!

46:21.730 --> 46:22.560
You overheard me?

46:22.650 --> 46:24.480
Then you know what to expect!

46:24.560 --> 46:27.480
Don't stick your snout
in my business again. Get out!

46:28.320 --> 46:29.570
Never again!

46:29.780 --> 46:32.030
Otherwise it's the slaughterhouse. Got it?

46:32.110 --> 46:33.490
Get out of here!

46:34.530 --> 46:36.030
Never again, you hear?

47:48.560 --> 47:50.520
What are you lazing about for?

47:50.610 --> 47:52.440
The work won't do itself!

47:52.530 --> 47:55.820
Come on! Get a move on,
or we'll never be done on time.

47:56.450 --> 47:58.200
Hey, you over there!

47:58.280 --> 48:00.660
Stop slacking off!

48:00.740 --> 48:03.580
Pick up rocks with the others,
and put them in the net.

48:04.330 --> 48:06.160
-Nice work.
-Well done, guys.

48:06.250 --> 48:08.420
-Can't you be careful?
-They come pretty quickly.

48:08.500 --> 48:10.420
I can't hold them back.

48:10.500 --> 48:12.210
But look what happened.

48:18.840 --> 48:22.180
Why did they have to predict
the coming of this fool?

48:22.260 --> 48:25.600
It's not my fault I don't see
what I want in the present,

48:25.680 --> 48:27.690
and what I don't want in the future.

48:46.500 --> 48:52.290
You, Kryton, our royal architect.
Tell us about the quarrel.

48:52.380 --> 48:54.210
To get the rock in the right place,

48:54.300 --> 48:58.590
we have to cross the courtyard of Firos,
who is against it, Your Majesty.

49:01.640 --> 49:04.770
And you, dyer. What have you to say?

49:05.220 --> 49:07.020
If the rock crosses my courtyard,

49:07.100 --> 49:11.650
my wall will get broken,
and my workshop will get smashed up.

49:12.400 --> 49:14.440
-Your Majesty.
-Huh?

49:14.520 --> 49:18.820
My wall, blah, blah, blah, Your Majesty.
Smashed, blah, blah, blah, Your Majesty.

49:25.370 --> 49:28.660
Your Patriarch has always opted
for what's best for the majority.

49:29.290 --> 49:33.420
In tribute to his fairness
and in the continuity of his wisdom.

49:36.340 --> 49:37.800
Destroy the dyer's wall!

50:10.370 --> 50:12.000
I know you can hear me!

50:14.000 --> 50:15.750
The butcher's looking for you!

50:18.710 --> 50:21.130
If you go back to the village,
we'll have a feast,

50:22.220 --> 50:24.390
but you'll be the main course!

50:44.530 --> 50:45.490
What's wrong, Father?

50:45.910 --> 50:46.740
What do you care?

50:46.830 --> 50:48.910
Suddenly you care about dyeing clothes?

50:48.990 --> 50:53.370
Did you care when you were away,
when I needed you?

50:53.460 --> 50:57.460
I was taking refuge in the mountain
to write an ode to Clytia.

50:57.540 --> 50:59.760
Do you know how she kept herself busy?

51:00.880 --> 51:02.170
I don't care, Father.

51:02.260 --> 51:05.890
Swooning in the arms of the human pig!

51:06.760 --> 51:07.600
No way!

51:07.680 --> 51:09.970
Minor's mouth on Clytia's…

51:10.060 --> 51:12.100
Yes! I saw it with my own eyes.

51:13.730 --> 51:17.610
Let's use our shared hatred
to get rid of the traitor!

51:19.270 --> 51:23.610
Your mind is as sick
as your bowels, Father.

51:24.950 --> 51:28.830
It makes you slander the most pure,
the most chaste of creatures!

51:28.910 --> 51:30.740
Chaste as a bitch in heat.

51:30.830 --> 51:32.120
Remember her defense?

51:32.450 --> 51:34.830
She corrupted the wisest among us.

51:34.920 --> 51:38.420
And now, she's taking advantage
of your unbelievable gullibility!

51:38.500 --> 51:40.210
That's the truth, dear poet!

51:41.130 --> 51:43.010
Shut your dirty mouth!

51:45.300 --> 51:48.390
Remember I am your father.

51:54.560 --> 51:56.230
That's why I won't clobber you.

51:59.560 --> 52:03.860
But your "dear poet"
is no longer your son.

52:17.330 --> 52:19.880
Have you seen a sow around here?

52:23.050 --> 52:23.880
Hey.

52:25.090 --> 52:26.800
You should bow to your king.

52:27.590 --> 52:29.090
If not, you show contempt.

52:30.720 --> 52:35.060
I didn't see a sow, but I can see a pig.

52:38.850 --> 52:40.400
How dare you?

52:40.480 --> 52:42.940
You left your manure to spread it around.

52:44.030 --> 52:47.030
You have tainted Clytia's
immaculate soul with your muck.

52:47.360 --> 52:48.740
You're crazy. That's absurd.

52:48.820 --> 52:51.320
Shut your filthy mouth immediately.
That's an order!

52:51.410 --> 52:52.780
I am your king!

52:53.910 --> 52:57.000
And I am poetic justice.

52:58.920 --> 53:01.580
I avenge cuckolds and soiled virgins!

53:18.600 --> 53:19.640
Let me go!

53:47.920 --> 53:51.130
Karkos, are you holding on to my ankles?

53:51.550 --> 53:53.100
Yes, I am, Your Majesty.

53:53.180 --> 53:58.310
Are you aware that the life of your king
is in your hands?

53:58.850 --> 54:01.350
I just need to loosen my hands
to prove it, Your Majesty.

54:01.440 --> 54:05.230
Don't do that!

54:05.320 --> 54:07.070
Never, you hear? Never.

54:07.150 --> 54:12.160
I never went after Clytia.

54:12.240 --> 54:14.160
The day you were crowned by the dove,

54:14.950 --> 54:17.540
you displayed your cocky manhood.

54:17.620 --> 54:21.830
I was turned on by life in general,
Karkos.

54:21.920 --> 54:25.840
The future, the prospects of power.

54:26.670 --> 54:30.630
It was an erection of principle.

54:31.090 --> 54:34.300
<i>Oh, how deep is the abyss of life</i>

54:34.640 --> 54:37.310
<i>Oh, how sweet it is</i>
<i>To know that you are loved!</i>

54:39.180 --> 54:40.060
What did you say?

54:40.140 --> 54:45.270
<i>My mind was dazzled by your words</i>

54:45.360 --> 54:49.280
<i>Jealousy has no place in your poetic soul</i>

54:49.360 --> 54:51.610
<i>You were made to sing of life's splendors</i>

54:52.360 --> 54:55.700
<i>Oh, how deep is the abyss of life</i>

54:55.780 --> 54:57.160
<i>Oh, how sweet</i>

54:58.580 --> 54:59.490
Karkos?

55:01.540 --> 55:03.670
Karkos? Are you there?

55:05.920 --> 55:07.170
Yes, Your Majesty.

55:08.960 --> 55:11.170
I will always be there for you.

55:33.490 --> 55:35.740
Let me kiss your feet, Your Majesty.

55:35.820 --> 55:36.700
No.

55:36.780 --> 55:39.120
Grant me redemption.

55:40.330 --> 55:45.870
You have muscles of marble.

55:46.830 --> 55:49.670
They are at your service, Your Majesty.
It is my solemn vow.

55:56.090 --> 55:59.390
Get up.

56:00.640 --> 56:05.640
<i>Oh, how deep is the abyss of life</i>

56:05.730 --> 56:09.980
Play, poet, and sing
the greatness of your king.

56:10.070 --> 56:16.950
<i>Oh, how sweet it is</i>
<i>To know that you are loved!</i>

56:20.700 --> 56:24.830
IT IS EASIER TO FOOL YOUR PEOPLE
THAN THE QUEEN OF YOUR HEART

56:51.440 --> 56:54.860
Bravo!

56:54.940 --> 56:56.820
Bravo, architect!

56:56.900 --> 57:00.700
Bravo, Kryton!

57:09.330 --> 57:11.880
He's so handsome!

57:13.170 --> 57:16.510
I, Minor the First,

57:18.550 --> 57:19.430
salute you.

57:21.970 --> 57:24.390
I like this half-breed pig.

57:24.470 --> 57:29.270
Long live the Dove King!

57:29.640 --> 57:34.360
Long live the Dove King!

57:34.440 --> 57:36.150
Long live the Dove King!

57:46.540 --> 57:51.670
Clytia, you must birth
a long line of strapping lads,

57:51.750 --> 57:56.500
as strong as goats,
lively as kids, but smart as foxes.

57:56.590 --> 57:58.670
Like him.

57:59.880 --> 58:01.050
With Minor, Father?

58:03.470 --> 58:04.470
But I love Karkos.

58:04.760 --> 58:07.470
So? What's the problem?

58:11.190 --> 58:15.570
We have prayed to the sacred doves
I carry on my head.

58:16.570 --> 58:21.070
But you, my dear subjects,

58:21.150 --> 58:24.120
I carry you in my heart.

58:26.160 --> 58:31.160
Today marks the first day
of a glorious future for our island.

58:31.660 --> 58:36.040
First rule: happiness is mandatory.

58:37.040 --> 58:40.760
Complaining is forbidden. Woe is banished!

58:41.130 --> 58:44.260
Bravo!

58:51.730 --> 58:53.230
Second rule:

58:54.440 --> 58:57.770
because of the waste, filth, and muck

58:57.860 --> 59:01.150
that contaminates the food they eat,

59:01.240 --> 59:07.450
eating pork is strictly forbidden!

59:09.660 --> 59:10.950
What? What did he say?

59:12.460 --> 59:15.580
Third and final rule:

59:16.080 --> 59:20.460
two weeks off for everyone,
including housewives!

59:21.260 --> 59:26.680
Down with work!
Long live leisure! Long live laziness!

59:26.760 --> 59:31.640
And… Minor the First!

59:42.070 --> 59:45.700
Minor!

1:00:38.500 --> 1:00:39.420
Clytia!

1:00:42.210 --> 1:00:44.760
Clytia! What's the matter?

1:00:46.220 --> 1:00:49.430
Sorry I'm late. I had to see your father
after the party.

1:00:50.390 --> 1:00:51.720
He loved my statue.

1:00:52.140 --> 1:00:54.220
What about you?

1:00:57.560 --> 1:00:58.690
It was the speech.

1:00:59.310 --> 1:01:01.610
-You liked it?
-Not as much as the sow.

1:01:01.690 --> 1:01:03.570
You're a dirty liar!

1:01:04.860 --> 1:01:07.240
You promised me.
I ran into her after the party.

1:01:07.650 --> 1:01:09.450
All pigs look the same.

1:01:09.530 --> 1:01:11.990
She pissed in front of me.
She farted in my face!

1:01:12.950 --> 1:01:16.200
She has very bad manners.

1:01:17.500 --> 1:01:20.420
Your father said
you have a surprise for me.

1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:23.840
Here it is.

1:01:25.050 --> 1:01:27.300
Since you forbid your subjects
from killing pigs,

1:01:28.130 --> 1:01:30.470
you can do it yourself, Your Majesty.

1:01:31.140 --> 1:01:33.970
You think you're a real man?

1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:38.060
Prove it to yourself. It's now or never.

1:01:38.140 --> 1:01:41.480
Or there'll be no more Clytia
or Golden Mask to make you believe it.

1:01:42.480 --> 1:01:43.520
Ever.

1:01:44.230 --> 1:01:46.110
Minor!

1:02:00.620 --> 1:02:02.500
What a superb view. Superb!

1:02:05.340 --> 1:02:06.710
No, I don't want to swim.

1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:12.300
Why did I bring you here?

1:02:13.180 --> 1:02:14.600
I have a surprise for you.

1:02:17.390 --> 1:02:19.020
You've got one for me too?

1:02:19.850 --> 1:02:25.230
Well, go on! Show me your secret!

1:02:30.650 --> 1:02:34.160
Everyone knows this is where
my mother's boat ran aground.

1:02:34.700 --> 1:02:36.450
Is that your surprise?

1:02:52.930 --> 1:02:54.090
My mother…

1:02:59.390 --> 1:03:00.270
Stop grunting!

1:03:08.270 --> 1:03:09.570
What necklace?

1:03:13.360 --> 1:03:16.530
How do you know it's hers? You were there?

1:03:19.410 --> 1:03:20.540
How can that be?

1:03:23.830 --> 1:03:25.460
Reincarnation?

1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:27.290
What reincarnation?

1:03:31.710 --> 1:03:35.010
You mean the spirit of my mother
is in the body of a sow?

1:03:38.600 --> 1:03:39.810
Mommy?

1:03:51.780 --> 1:03:54.780
-Who goes there? You want to fight?
-Wait! It's me.

1:03:54.860 --> 1:03:57.070
-What do you have beneath your robe?
-My mother.

1:03:57.490 --> 1:04:01.040
Well, you do look like her!
The spitting image!

1:04:05.500 --> 1:04:07.420
Sorry. My mare got carried away.

1:04:07.500 --> 1:04:09.340
It's Centaur. He's very popular!

1:04:15.010 --> 1:04:17.800
Clytia, my secret fiancée,

1:04:17.890 --> 1:04:19.640
the future queen,

1:04:20.760 --> 1:04:22.600
demands I slit my ex's throat.

1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:23.770
Classic!

1:04:24.980 --> 1:04:26.560
Perhaps, but…

1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:31.900
I couldn't. I just slit my thumb. Look.

1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:34.690
Oh, you poor thing.

1:04:34.780 --> 1:04:36.860
What's so amazing about your ex?

1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:39.530
She's a sow.

1:04:40.280 --> 1:04:41.450
How many heads, tails?

1:04:41.530 --> 1:04:44.000
She's a normal beast,
who you'd turn into bacon.

1:04:44.080 --> 1:04:47.000
You're screwing a normal sow.
That's gross, Your Majesty.

1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:48.330
Well, you screw a tree!

1:04:48.630 --> 1:04:49.920
Hey!

1:04:51.250 --> 1:04:52.340
Stay out of my business.

1:04:52.420 --> 1:04:54.090
The sow and me, it's spiritual!

1:04:54.170 --> 1:04:55.630
Me and my tree, too.

1:04:56.010 --> 1:04:57.590
Yeah, but she was my mother.

1:04:58.090 --> 1:04:59.300
Of course!

1:05:00.600 --> 1:05:01.430
Right.

1:05:04.270 --> 1:05:06.020
What's the problem? I'm listening.

1:05:07.270 --> 1:05:12.020
How do I explain to Clytia
that I couldn't kill her?

1:05:12.570 --> 1:05:13.520
Lie!

1:05:14.030 --> 1:05:17.700
-I did. It was a disaster.
-No, no, no. Lie better.

1:05:20.360 --> 1:05:21.660
Look.

1:05:22.160 --> 1:05:24.990
Look at the splendid myth at work.

1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:29.580
That ardor, that confidence… yes!

1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:32.590
Lie with panache.
Intoxicate yourself with your lie.

1:05:33.590 --> 1:05:36.630
Drag us into the whirlwind of your deceit.

1:05:37.670 --> 1:05:41.840
Take charge, kid. Take charge.

1:05:41.930 --> 1:05:43.050
-You're right.
-Yes.

1:05:43.140 --> 1:05:44.060
-You're right.
-Yes.

1:05:44.140 --> 1:05:46.100
Satyr, you're right!

1:05:46.680 --> 1:05:48.230
How can I ever thank you?

1:05:48.310 --> 1:05:49.390
I know how. Come!

1:05:49.480 --> 1:05:50.650
No!

1:05:50.730 --> 1:05:51.810
I had a terrible day!

1:05:51.900 --> 1:05:53.770
-Come on.
-No, I have a migraine!

1:05:53.860 --> 1:05:56.940
-Just a bit.
-Another time.

1:05:57.030 --> 1:05:59.900
Hey, you forgot your mom!

1:06:05.330 --> 1:06:06.330
Thank you!

1:06:19.800 --> 1:06:22.800
His Majesty sent me to say, it's done!

1:06:22.890 --> 1:06:24.680
It wasn't easy,

1:06:24.760 --> 1:06:27.930
because he's not
a professional pig killer.

1:06:28.020 --> 1:06:31.310
So to prove it, here's the corkscrew tail.

1:06:31.850 --> 1:06:37.020
We have… one ear.

1:06:37.110 --> 1:06:40.530
It's the right one.

1:06:40.610 --> 1:06:41.450
Want the other?

1:06:42.570 --> 1:06:43.570
No.

1:06:44.990 --> 1:06:46.660
Follow me. He's waiting.

1:06:49.700 --> 1:06:51.870
You're right, Satyr! You're right!

1:07:08.890 --> 1:07:10.220
This is my mother.

1:07:13.900 --> 1:07:16.440
Her spirit found refuge
in the body of a sow.

1:07:17.770 --> 1:07:19.320
I freed her.

1:07:20.650 --> 1:07:22.570
This splendid necklace was hers.

1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:26.530
Karkos, may I give it to your fiancée?

1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:29.410
It would be an honor, Your Majesty.

1:07:40.880 --> 1:07:42.130
Reverend Rectus!

1:07:49.260 --> 1:07:50.680
Look at yourself.

1:08:14.330 --> 1:08:15.500
Your Majesty!

1:08:16.080 --> 1:08:18.540
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

1:08:18.630 --> 1:08:20.840
Don't panic! It's normal.

1:08:21.460 --> 1:08:25.470
He found his mother, killed his sow.
It's an emotional time.

1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:27.720
Come.

1:09:28.530 --> 1:09:31.160
Your Majesty, did you know you sleepwalk?

1:09:32.450 --> 1:09:34.540
Last night you suckled on Zima's breast.

1:09:36.580 --> 1:09:38.210
I suckled on Zima's breast?

1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:42.330
In your boat,

1:09:43.710 --> 1:09:45.460
where my fiancé left you.

1:09:47.460 --> 1:09:49.340
Your brother, now.

1:09:53.260 --> 1:09:57.560
You were whimpering like a baby,
and you sucked your thumb.

1:09:59.140 --> 1:10:00.140
Like this.

1:10:05.400 --> 1:10:07.730
So Zima offered her breast,

1:10:09.820 --> 1:10:11.610
and you suckled greedily,

1:10:12.820 --> 1:10:14.330
without even waking up.

1:10:40.180 --> 1:10:42.020
I'm so happy.

1:10:43.310 --> 1:10:47.070
I was so afraid you enjoyed

1:10:47.150 --> 1:10:49.940
the virile company of my fiancé to mine.

1:10:59.660 --> 1:11:03.540
Your Majesty? What are you doing?

1:11:05.500 --> 1:11:08.050
Stop! What are you doing?

1:11:08.130 --> 1:11:09.510
Stop!

1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:16.220
Stop! Let me go!

1:11:16.300 --> 1:11:18.220
Let me go!

1:11:22.310 --> 1:11:24.060
I'm not the sow!

1:11:24.150 --> 1:11:26.020
It's me, Clytia!

1:11:27.900 --> 1:11:29.610
Go back to your pigsty.

1:11:30.780 --> 1:11:32.360
That's where you belong.

1:12:02.560 --> 1:12:03.770
Are you crying?

1:12:05.190 --> 1:12:08.060
Why are you crying?

1:12:08.940 --> 1:12:10.020
I hate him.

1:12:11.480 --> 1:12:12.690
I hate myself.

1:12:17.070 --> 1:12:18.910
When he became a man,

1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:23.080
I imagined he was
the noble sovereign of our island.

1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:27.870
The humiliating, unbearable failure.

1:12:29.500 --> 1:12:30.750
Pig he was,

1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.590
pig he will be again.

1:12:38.680 --> 1:12:40.970
You're lucky to be a vestal virgin.

1:12:43.810 --> 1:12:47.690
Immaculate. Safe from men.

1:12:50.650 --> 1:12:52.940
You know, Reverend Rectus

1:12:55.400 --> 1:12:58.360
doesn't just pray to the doves.

1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:06.790
He gets intimate with me, too.

1:13:10.130 --> 1:13:11.840
He also acts like a beast.

1:13:12.250 --> 1:13:13.250
What?

1:13:13.340 --> 1:13:15.510
Naked, on me. He yells.

1:13:16.220 --> 1:13:20.470
He yells out, "Ooh, ooh!"

1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:26.430
But…

1:13:29.230 --> 1:13:31.940
It's a secret. A religious one.

1:13:35.730 --> 1:13:38.650
DISCONTENTMENT GROWS
AND HIS MAJESTY IS ALONE

1:13:38.740 --> 1:13:40.450
Satyr! I've got to talk to you!

1:13:49.540 --> 1:13:50.750
Satyr!

1:13:54.250 --> 1:13:55.460
Ah, there you are!

1:13:56.800 --> 1:13:58.170
I've got to talk to you!

1:13:58.630 --> 1:14:00.880
-You dreamt of me last night.
-How do you know?

1:14:00.970 --> 1:14:02.090
I was there!

1:14:02.390 --> 1:14:03.510
How were you there?

1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:07.600
Your darling sow sprayed me
with her disgusting milk!

1:14:08.430 --> 1:14:10.560
-Isn't this her milk?
-Yes.

1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:11.940
Isn't this her milk?

1:14:14.060 --> 1:14:15.150
No doubt about it.

1:14:15.440 --> 1:14:17.530
Well, it curdled and blocked the panpipes.

1:14:17.610 --> 1:14:19.280
-Unblock that!
-Satyr, you coming?

1:14:19.360 --> 1:14:20.530
Hurry up, Satyr!

1:14:20.650 --> 1:14:22.530
Sorry about that unfortunate incident.

1:14:22.610 --> 1:14:23.870
I won't dream of you again.

1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:28.620
You mortals are nothing to me.

1:14:28.700 --> 1:14:31.170
You're nothing. Get that into your head.

1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:33.080
You're being hard.

1:14:37.670 --> 1:14:38.840
You could at least listen.

1:14:45.220 --> 1:14:46.260
Satyr!

1:14:47.510 --> 1:14:48.930
You want some advice?

1:14:49.180 --> 1:14:53.560
Never stick your snout in here again.
Get out of here!

1:15:03.820 --> 1:15:07.450
I see horrific times up ahead.

1:15:07.530 --> 1:15:11.080
Human voices screaming in pigs' mouths,

1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:14.500
sharp pitchforks, sharp swords.

1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:20.590
Turn your eyes inward.
See the blood-soaked scenes.

1:15:21.090 --> 1:15:27.890
From the earth will arise a pestilence
hatched from hell.

1:15:27.970 --> 1:15:33.980
The fatal hour made of fire
and vengeful cries is approaching!

1:15:34.770 --> 1:15:37.020
It is approaching!

1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:42.030
Forbidding us from eating pork!

1:15:42.280 --> 1:15:46.740
Replacing sausage and bacon
with oysters and mussels!

1:15:46.820 --> 1:15:49.160
Now look at the result!

1:15:50.370 --> 1:15:51.330
This is serious.

1:15:51.700 --> 1:15:54.210
Let's share our complaints for a trial.

1:15:54.290 --> 1:15:57.330
Serves you right, all of you.

1:15:57.420 --> 1:15:59.750
Bunch of sycophants, pathetic ass-kissers!

1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:01.130
Look at yourselves,

1:16:01.210 --> 1:16:04.760
with all those pretentious,
trendy trinkets.

1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:06.640
You will speak when I say you can.

1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:10.470
Aura, my darling wife, speak!

1:16:10.560 --> 1:16:13.850
There will be no flour this winter.

1:16:13.930 --> 1:16:17.020
No one went to harvest the wheat
because they were building…

1:16:17.100 --> 1:16:18.230
That shit!

1:16:18.610 --> 1:16:21.320
Forgive me!

1:16:21.400 --> 1:16:22.530
Please, forgive me.

1:16:22.610 --> 1:16:24.030
I had to forsake my taste,

1:16:24.110 --> 1:16:27.110
turn my back on my beliefs!

1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:31.370
I disfigured our village by flouting
the golden rules of divine harmony.

1:16:31.830 --> 1:16:33.950
What will future generations think of us?

1:16:34.500 --> 1:16:38.580
I would give anything to smash
that grotesque eyesore.

1:16:39.710 --> 1:16:41.880
I come from a long line of pig killers,

1:16:42.130 --> 1:16:44.010
and here I am, scavenging in the sea.

1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:48.340
Before, I would treat you to sausages,
filet mignon…

1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:50.680
Now it's the stinking flesh of eels.

1:16:51.010 --> 1:16:52.970
And that's not all!

1:16:53.060 --> 1:16:56.480
That Minor wants
to suckle at my Zima's breast!

1:16:56.560 --> 1:16:58.400
No one wants to do that.

1:16:58.480 --> 1:17:00.810
Firos, we know how you feel. Be brief.

1:17:01.110 --> 1:17:03.440
I want to pulverize that hybrid creature.

1:17:03.530 --> 1:17:06.740
I want to destroy "Your Majesty"
like he destroyed my home.

1:17:06.820 --> 1:17:07.990
He destroyed my son,

1:17:08.360 --> 1:17:09.240
my joyful son!

1:17:09.320 --> 1:17:11.990
Now his music is dismal.

1:17:12.330 --> 1:17:15.620
He's muddled by that made-up liar.

1:17:15.700 --> 1:17:18.670
Yes! Your daughter, the traitor!

1:17:18.750 --> 1:17:21.670
Leave my daughter out of it.
She's as pure as morning dew.

1:17:21.750 --> 1:17:24.090
She's as honest as her father.

1:17:24.170 --> 1:17:26.670
You're blinded by your hatred.
Let's finish this!

1:17:27.050 --> 1:17:29.590
Elder, you conclude.

1:17:30.430 --> 1:17:32.050
-If we can't--
-Not so loud!

1:17:33.430 --> 1:17:35.640
If we can't reach the fruit,

1:17:36.350 --> 1:17:38.440
let's leave it to rot on the tree.

1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:41.810
Be ready to shake the branch

1:17:41.900 --> 1:17:46.190
when the gods send a clear sign.

1:17:54.910 --> 1:17:59.210
THE PAST RESURFACES
AND WILL NOT BE SILENCED

1:18:12.430 --> 1:18:16.350
Perfect. Arm up, foot here…

1:18:17.390 --> 1:18:18.480
Like this.

1:18:25.650 --> 1:18:27.190
Look at the horizon.

1:18:28.490 --> 1:18:29.700
-Okay.
-Okay?

1:18:29.780 --> 1:18:31.910
And when we move,

1:18:32.700 --> 1:18:34.700
the disc has to go like this.

1:18:35.450 --> 1:18:36.790
And you let it go.

1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:42.500
It goes this way, not this way.
This way, like this. Okay?

1:18:58.770 --> 1:18:59.640
See?

1:19:07.150 --> 1:19:09.990
That's right.

1:19:18.280 --> 1:19:22.250
Bravo, Your Majesty! Bravo!

1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:47.610
Your Majesty.

1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:51.990
Your Majesty, I have great news!

1:19:52.570 --> 1:19:54.490
You can talk?

1:19:54.570 --> 1:19:57.700
-What did you say?
-I was pregnant!

1:19:58.030 --> 1:19:59.870
Oh, I didn't know!

1:19:59.950 --> 1:20:02.950
I gave birth to 12 piglets.
Isn't that wonderful?

1:20:03.370 --> 1:20:05.670
Yes. Wonderful.

1:20:05.750 --> 1:20:09.630
And why does that concern me?
What do you want me to do?

1:20:10.210 --> 1:20:11.630
Face your responsibilities.

1:20:11.710 --> 1:20:15.970
Ah, yes. My responsibilities.
What responsibilities?

1:20:16.510 --> 1:20:18.970
You're the father, Minor.

1:20:19.300 --> 1:20:20.560
Really? Who said that?

1:20:20.930 --> 1:20:23.680
The babies have human heads.
Your spitting image!

1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:26.600
-Oh, right.
-They want their daddy.

1:20:26.690 --> 1:20:30.320
Oh, yes, of course. And who is that?

1:20:30.400 --> 1:20:31.480
Your Majesty!

1:20:33.740 --> 1:20:34.740
Are you there?

1:20:35.320 --> 1:20:36.780
Are you all right?

1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:42.740
Yes, yes. I was "lifting the toga."
I'll be right there.

1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:48.750
Go back to the kids,
and not a word to anyone!

1:20:49.130 --> 1:20:52.630
I'll see you here in two weeks,
at the same time.

1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:55.760
Is that all you've got to say, sweetie?

1:20:58.130 --> 1:20:59.640
Kiss the kids for me.

1:21:16.190 --> 1:21:17.360
I just saw her.

1:21:18.570 --> 1:21:21.530
No, don't look. Head down.

1:21:22.120 --> 1:21:23.740
I saw her there. She can talk!

1:21:23.830 --> 1:21:26.870
She's got a strange accent.

1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:28.160
-Who?
-Her!

1:21:28.920 --> 1:21:31.750
My ex. My mom. I mean, my sow.

1:21:31.840 --> 1:21:34.000
The sow, my friends. I lied!

1:21:34.500 --> 1:21:36.340
Calm down, Your Majesty.

1:21:36.420 --> 1:21:39.090
Your Majesty, a king doesn't lie.
A king makes history.

1:21:39.180 --> 1:21:40.930
His lies become historical truth.

1:21:41.010 --> 1:21:42.760
Oh, faithful friend. You cheer me.

1:21:42.850 --> 1:21:44.430
I'll be brief as a stab in the back.

1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:50.230
Out of humanity, or wisdom…
I didn't slaughter the beast.

1:21:51.310 --> 1:21:53.230
And she just told me I'm a father!

1:21:53.650 --> 1:21:55.230
-Father?
-But who is the mother?

1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:56.150
My mother!

1:21:56.230 --> 1:21:58.900
Twelve sprogs, I mean piglets,
who look like me.

1:22:00.490 --> 1:22:03.490
My reign must continue without dishonor,

1:22:03.580 --> 1:22:07.330
my succession without controversy!

1:22:08.450 --> 1:22:11.750
Murder is a duty of the State!

1:22:11.880 --> 1:22:12.830
Kill everyone?

1:22:12.920 --> 1:22:15.710
Everything! Everyone!
Twelve kids, and their mom.

1:22:15.800 --> 1:22:17.340
-No orphans.
-Too cruel.

1:22:17.420 --> 1:22:19.220
-Far too cruel.
-Yes.

1:22:19.300 --> 1:22:25.390
Go, go! Find the filthy beast!

1:22:25.930 --> 1:22:27.100
Long live the king!

1:22:27.430 --> 1:22:28.640
Long live the king!

1:22:28.730 --> 1:22:30.100
Long live the king!

1:22:34.480 --> 1:22:35.440
Go!

1:22:50.710 --> 1:22:52.870
-It is done!
-What?

1:22:54.790 --> 1:22:57.420
-What's in the bag?
-Twelve heads!

1:22:57.800 --> 1:23:01.050
-Do they look like me?
-Just like you, Your Majesty.

1:23:01.130 --> 1:23:02.760
Especially the girls.

1:23:02.840 --> 1:23:06.430
Karkos, burn them. Bury them.
Just get them out of my sight!

1:23:06.510 --> 1:23:09.100
-Go, go!
-I'll take care of it.

1:23:11.180 --> 1:23:14.230
Get out! No, you stay!

1:23:17.400 --> 1:23:20.900
I don't know why I can't cry.

1:23:21.860 --> 1:23:24.450
Cry, Your Majesty, for you are a boy.

1:23:26.530 --> 1:23:31.620
A boy king whose heart
is filled with grief.

1:23:32.370 --> 1:23:34.620
Come, Your Majesty.

1:23:35.880 --> 1:23:37.090
Sit on my lap.

1:23:39.050 --> 1:23:43.380
A MOUTHFUL TOPPLES A REGIME

1:24:07.160 --> 1:24:09.080
Gently, Your Majesty.

1:24:10.330 --> 1:24:12.040
Gently. That hurts.

1:24:12.870 --> 1:24:14.330
Your Majesty, gently!

1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:15.960
Let me go!

1:24:19.710 --> 1:24:21.960
Little snot! I'll whack you!

1:24:23.130 --> 1:24:26.550
You killed my sow, slaughtered my kids,
destroyed my family!

1:24:26.890 --> 1:24:28.090
Damn you!

1:24:28.180 --> 1:24:31.180
-You'll pay for this!
-Bloody demon!

1:24:31.680 --> 1:24:33.020
I'll calm you down!

1:24:33.100 --> 1:24:34.270
No!

1:24:36.190 --> 1:24:40.190
You dirty, disgusting cannibal!

1:24:40.270 --> 1:24:42.190
You'll pay for this!

1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:46.650
The beast bit me! He bit me again!

1:24:46.740 --> 1:24:49.070
The pig bit me again!

1:24:49.780 --> 1:24:51.410
Kill him!

1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:55.580
Give it back!

1:25:00.840 --> 1:25:03.170
Help me!

1:25:04.510 --> 1:25:06.590
The cannibal bit me again!

1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:09.220
It's time!

1:25:09.300 --> 1:25:10.350
Grab your pitchforks!

1:25:10.430 --> 1:25:12.350
Kill the imposter!

1:25:14.270 --> 1:25:18.230
It's a clear sign from the gods!

1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:22.610
Find him! That way!

1:25:22.690 --> 1:25:24.570
Get the pervert!

1:25:24.650 --> 1:25:26.190
Put the pig in the pigsty!

1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:27.740
Kill the four-legged king!

1:25:27.820 --> 1:25:29.280
He's not far!

1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:31.990
Kill the half-breed!

1:25:32.080 --> 1:25:35.450
Down with the pig monarchy!
Long live the Patriarchy!

1:25:37.330 --> 1:25:38.160
Where did he go?

1:25:38.250 --> 1:25:40.630
Zima saw the doves leaving the pig's head!

1:25:40.710 --> 1:25:42.500
I knew it! I told you!

1:25:42.590 --> 1:25:44.380
-Where?
-There!

1:25:45.460 --> 1:25:46.380
Slaughter him!

1:25:46.460 --> 1:25:47.590
I saw something move!

1:25:47.670 --> 1:25:48.760
-Where?
-There!

1:25:48.840 --> 1:25:49.680
Kill him!

1:25:49.760 --> 1:25:51.390
Follow me!

1:25:52.050 --> 1:25:53.390
Come on! Let's go!

1:25:53.470 --> 1:25:54.850
He's bitten before!

1:25:54.930 --> 1:25:57.310
-We'll kill him!
-He's disappeared!

1:26:54.570 --> 1:26:55.490
I heard something.

1:26:55.580 --> 1:26:56.580
Clytia!

1:26:56.660 --> 1:26:59.330
Clytia! Did you see the beast?

1:26:59.750 --> 1:27:02.670
Where are you?

1:27:03.290 --> 1:27:06.170
-Clytia!
-Clytia!

1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:09.670
Help me!

1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:10.840
Where are you?

1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:13.970
It's too late, Your Majesty.
I can't help you.

1:27:14.760 --> 1:27:16.350
-Clytia!
-Clytia!

1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:17.640
I'm here!

1:27:18.260 --> 1:27:19.140
He's here, with me.

1:27:19.930 --> 1:27:21.020
Where is he?

1:27:21.100 --> 1:27:24.230
Run! Run like the hunted beast you are.

1:27:24.310 --> 1:27:25.230
Clytia!

1:27:25.310 --> 1:27:26.610
That you've always been.

1:27:26.690 --> 1:27:28.610
We're coming!

1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:32.900
Clytia! Did you see the beast?

1:27:32.990 --> 1:27:34.860
Where did the bastard go?

1:27:36.700 --> 1:27:38.780
That way. Toward the olive grove.

1:27:38.870 --> 1:27:44.210
That way! To the olive grove! Follow me!

1:27:57.720 --> 1:28:02.430
THE DAWN REVEALS
THE LAST SECRETS IN THE SHADOWS

1:28:03.310 --> 1:28:06.190
He's here! Hurry!

1:28:06.270 --> 1:28:08.520
He's on the cliff path.

1:28:08.610 --> 1:28:10.150
We've got him!

1:28:12.860 --> 1:28:14.320
He can't go any further!

1:28:18.120 --> 1:28:22.200
Karkos? Karkos, don't drop me!

1:28:28.460 --> 1:28:30.000
Catch your breath.

1:28:31.500 --> 1:28:33.130
How can I ever thank you?

1:28:34.130 --> 1:28:36.010
I have nothing to give.

1:28:36.340 --> 1:28:38.840
I don't deserve your gratitude,
Your Majesty.

1:28:40.140 --> 1:28:41.060
I lied to you.

1:28:42.970 --> 1:28:46.480
Before you leave,
I have to show you something.

1:28:51.110 --> 1:28:54.070
When I saw the babies, I couldn't do it.

1:28:54.150 --> 1:28:55.990
But none of them has a human head!

1:28:56.070 --> 1:28:58.740
She wanted to make you crazy.

1:28:58.820 --> 1:29:00.160
Out of revenge, I guess.

1:29:00.240 --> 1:29:02.040
And who's that?

1:29:03.490 --> 1:29:08.750
What? My sow with that dirty brute?

1:29:09.330 --> 1:29:10.920
She suffered when you left her.

1:29:11.460 --> 1:29:12.920
Shouldn't she be happy?

1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:14.460
You're right, Karkos.

1:29:15.720 --> 1:29:17.470
Let her live her life.

1:29:17.550 --> 1:29:19.390
Let's go!

1:29:36.320 --> 1:29:37.900
I betrayed you too.

1:29:38.360 --> 1:29:40.410
Just listen to what I have to say.

1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:44.240
Clytia, your love, your betrothed…

1:29:46.410 --> 1:29:47.580
lay with me.

1:30:05.850 --> 1:30:07.020
This place

1:30:08.390 --> 1:30:10.100
is wild and hostile

1:30:10.190 --> 1:30:13.520
and perfect for hearing
what you just told me, Your Majesty.

1:30:15.980 --> 1:30:18.610
I just broke the heart of the person
I respect

1:30:19.360 --> 1:30:20.860
and love the most.

1:30:21.530 --> 1:30:23.740
This heart has been broken
for a long time.

1:30:26.490 --> 1:30:28.950
But you thought I didn't know,

1:30:31.290 --> 1:30:33.460
and that is why I cry today.

1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:41.470
Clytia always told me everything,
since the first night in the olive grove.

1:30:43.140 --> 1:30:45.430
I heard every detail.

1:30:45.510 --> 1:30:47.640
I was ravaged by hatred,

1:30:49.100 --> 1:30:51.980
and by jealous admiration.

1:30:54.150 --> 1:30:56.980
Why didn't you drop me off the cliff?

1:30:58.400 --> 1:31:01.030
Between the carnal pleasure
you shared with her

1:31:02.700 --> 1:31:04.320
and my own happiness,

1:31:07.080 --> 1:31:08.660
I chose yours.

1:31:09.660 --> 1:31:11.080
Oh, Karkos.

1:31:11.660 --> 1:31:13.370
Let me drink at your lips.

1:31:15.420 --> 1:31:17.500
You are a poet with a luminous soul.

1:31:19.300 --> 1:31:22.300
There are some broken reeds over here!

1:31:22.380 --> 1:31:24.090
This way, near the swamp!

1:31:24.180 --> 1:31:26.800
This way! Can you hear us?

1:31:29.140 --> 1:31:30.520
Where are you?

1:31:31.810 --> 1:31:33.520
Where did you go?

1:31:33.600 --> 1:31:34.940
Come back to the middle.

1:31:35.020 --> 1:31:38.730
Your Majesty! The branch! Come!

1:31:40.150 --> 1:31:42.530
Follow our voices!

1:31:42.610 --> 1:31:43.450
Climb up.

1:31:45.620 --> 1:31:46.530
Climb up!

1:31:46.620 --> 1:31:50.290
Hang on. Wait for me.

1:31:53.580 --> 1:31:54.580
Hurry!

1:31:54.670 --> 1:31:55.670
Wait!

1:32:05.840 --> 1:32:07.510
I'm sinking, Majesty.

1:32:07.600 --> 1:32:09.810
Give me your arm.

1:32:09.890 --> 1:32:11.430
I'm trapped in the mud.

1:32:11.810 --> 1:32:16.270
Hold on! Come on, climb up.

1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:18.060
I can't move.

1:32:22.900 --> 1:32:25.150
I heard a noise! This way!

1:32:27.200 --> 1:32:30.370
In this mud, I am weaker than a lamb.

1:32:32.790 --> 1:32:34.160
They'll kill me.

1:32:34.250 --> 1:32:37.210
Tikus! Hey, Tikus! Go around.

1:32:37.960 --> 1:32:42.710
Tikus, get them from behind!

1:32:43.710 --> 1:32:46.010
There are broken reeds. This way!

1:32:46.930 --> 1:32:48.720
This way!

1:32:48.800 --> 1:32:50.140
If you're a man,

1:32:51.720 --> 1:32:53.430
if you're my brother,

1:32:55.020 --> 1:32:56.730
if you're my master,

1:32:58.020 --> 1:32:59.480
spare me this unworthy end.

1:32:59.980 --> 1:33:01.480
-No.
-Do it, Minor!

1:33:01.570 --> 1:33:03.900
-No!
-With me! Do it!

1:33:03.980 --> 1:33:07.530
Your only regret will be not doing it.
Do it.

1:33:09.570 --> 1:33:10.660
Push!

1:33:11.620 --> 1:33:14.950
We can do it! Now!

1:33:29.550 --> 1:33:31.550
We're stuck. Go around. That way!

1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:34.100
That way! Go there!

1:33:35.890 --> 1:33:37.690
Just ahead, I can see him!

1:33:37.770 --> 1:33:41.310
Where?

1:33:43.190 --> 1:33:44.110
There!

1:33:44.190 --> 1:33:45.940
Rectus, did you see him?

1:33:52.700 --> 1:33:54.330
The pig's reign is over!

1:33:55.330 --> 1:33:59.830
Free from the tyrant's dynasty!
The ungodly reign is over!

1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:01.380
Kill him!

1:34:01.830 --> 1:34:04.800
I can't see anything!

1:34:11.680 --> 1:34:13.970
We can't see anything! Where are you?

1:34:18.770 --> 1:34:22.610
MANY YEARS LATER…

1:34:53.470 --> 1:34:54.510
Your turn!

1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:05.730
What now? Carry on!

1:35:05.820 --> 1:35:09.320
Just looking at you exhausts me.
You don't age!

1:35:09.650 --> 1:35:12.660
What do you expect?
Myths are immortal, my old friend!

1:35:13.410 --> 1:35:16.370
I know, and it pisses me off.
Stop calling me "old" friend!

1:35:16.830 --> 1:35:18.240
-Be polite, Your Majesty.
-Let's go.

1:35:18.330 --> 1:35:20.290
Play, Mimi. Three, four!

1:40:36.150 --> 1:40:38.230
