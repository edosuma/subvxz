<i>I was thinking we might switch
back to seeing each other once a month.</i>

00:38.771 --> 00:42.873
<i>Yeah, I'm feeling like
I'm in a really good place.</i>

00:42.875 --> 00:44.308
<i>You know, like,
I've done the work.</i>

00:44.310 --> 00:46.179
<i>We've done the work.
We've done it.</i>

00:48.747 --> 00:50.849
<i>Have you spoken
with your father recently?</i>

00:53.085 --> 00:54.684
Well, I...

00:54.686 --> 00:56.588
He called,
but I did not pick up.

00:59.859 --> 01:01.625
He knows the conditions.

01:01.627 --> 01:03.693
- So you set a boundary?
- Yeah.

01:03.695 --> 01:05.664
That must have been
very difficult for you.

01:06.397 --> 01:08.466
Not really.

01:08.468 --> 01:10.868
No. I'm feeling
really resolute.

01:10.870 --> 01:12.502
Like, very resolute.

01:12.504 --> 01:14.671
So resolute, in fact...

01:14.673 --> 01:18.607
I was thinking, is this the
best time to set a boundary?

01:18.609 --> 01:22.614
You know, stay with me here, because
I'm wondering...

01:24.283 --> 01:29.222
Maybe it would be best
if I did pick up.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.424
- You know?
- I don't.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.660
Uh, okay, well,
it wouldn't be, like,

01:35.662 --> 01:37.360
to ask for help
or anything like that.

01:37.362 --> 01:41.231
Like, I'm not discounting years
of disappointment, years...

01:41.233 --> 01:43.100
And abandonment.

01:43.102 --> 01:46.770
Well, I was going to say
missed opportunities,

01:46.772 --> 01:50.574
but, yeah, sure, yeah,
let's just say abandonment.

01:50.576 --> 01:54.044
Your father is incapable
of helping you, Laura.

01:54.046 --> 01:55.880
It doesn't matter
how much you love him.

01:55.882 --> 01:57.283
He's never gonna change.

01:57.983 --> 01:59.618
I know. You're right.

02:00.653 --> 02:02.285
I know.

02:02.287 --> 02:06.189
I was just testing you that time
to see if you had softened.

02:06.191 --> 02:08.257
Ha-ha.

02:08.258 --> 02:11.728
You're not that little girl who needs her
father's love and attention anymore.

02:11.730 --> 02:14.099
You're doing just fine
on your own.

02:17.603 --> 02:19.903
I know.
Yeah, you're right. I know.

02:19.905 --> 02:23.340
I know. You're right.
I am. I really am.

02:23.342 --> 02:25.144
I don't know
why I keep forgetting that.

02:29.414 --> 02:31.481
I do notice you have a kitten
hidden in your purse.

02:31.483 --> 02:32.983
Were you hiding it from me?

02:32.985 --> 02:35.052
No, of course not.

02:35.054 --> 02:37.154
I wasn't hiding it from you.
I...

02:37.156 --> 02:39.423
I found it in the,
in the parking lot.

02:39.425 --> 02:43.960
I thought that you weren't gonna pick
up any stray animals this month.

02:43.962 --> 02:47.131
Well, it's the 28th,
so technically,

02:47.133 --> 02:49.201
if it was February,
it is the end of the month.

02:50.203 --> 02:51.835
Not February.

02:51.837 --> 02:55.172
Yeah, but I have secured a home for
this kitty, so it's different.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.975
I think our hour is up.

04:07.545 --> 04:09.014
Hey.

04:19.158 --> 04:21.759
I can feed her.
I'm already up.

04:21.761 --> 04:25.596
That would be wonderful.
Thank you, honey. Yeah.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.264
- That douchebag sleep over?
- Yeah, he did.

04:28.266 --> 04:31.235
Yeah. But he's actually
a pretty good guy.

04:31.237 --> 04:32.805
I wish you'd give him
a chance.

04:33.372 --> 04:34.841
Did you...

04:37.076 --> 04:39.041
Oh, come on, Henry.

04:39.043 --> 04:40.746
Just let me have one date.

04:43.581 --> 04:47.387
How about, if you act really normal in
the morning, I'll drive you to school?

04:48.754 --> 04:51.253
Crouton peed more blood,
but she passed the stone.

04:51.255 --> 04:52.555
- She did?
- Yeah.

04:52.557 --> 04:54.024
I put it in a Ziploc bag
in the fridge.

04:54.026 --> 04:56.993
Oh, I love that you did that.
I love that. Thank you.

04:56.995 --> 04:59.462
Hey, maybe you'll be a vet.

04:59.464 --> 05:01.866
Wouldn't that be an
incredible end to our story?

05:02.999 --> 05:03.568
Or I could be a taxidermist.

05:04.269 --> 05:05.937
I think you're great.

05:15.915 --> 05:17.650
Shh. Shh. Shh.

05:22.788 --> 05:25.490
Taco. Taco, you get up here.

05:30.829 --> 05:33.462
- What the fuck?
- What happened?

05:33.464 --> 05:36.834
- Your fucking cat ran over my face.
- What?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.601
I thought you said
no animals in the bed.

05:38.603 --> 05:39.702
I did.

05:39.704 --> 05:42.139
Get off! Get off!

05:42.141 --> 05:44.473
Am I bleeding?

05:44.475 --> 05:46.810
Uh, not really, no. Just...

05:46.812 --> 05:48.144
It's just, like, a...
It's a little nick.

05:48.146 --> 05:50.247
Damn it.

05:50.249 --> 05:52.916
Jesus Christ, Laura, you have
way too many fucking animals.

05:52.918 --> 05:55.185
Seriously. Am I gonna get
cat-scratch fever or something?

05:55.187 --> 05:58.187
Oh, there's no such thing. There's
no such thing. Go back to bed.

05:58.189 --> 05:59.957
I got to get out of here.

06:03.062 --> 06:04.327
Oh, good. Good.

06:04.329 --> 06:05.796
- That's fucking great.
- Tino!

06:05.798 --> 06:08.565
- Yeah.
- Oh, I...

06:08.567 --> 06:11.468
This is really out of
the ordinary, I swear.

06:11.470 --> 06:13.437
People are usually like,
"You have nine animals?

06:13.439 --> 06:15.305
"It only seems like
you have four."

06:17.976 --> 06:22.144
Laura, I think you're great.
I really do.

06:22.146 --> 06:24.014
And it's super cool
what you're doing here,

06:24.016 --> 06:25.949
and you're probably gonna go
to fucking Heaven or whatever,

06:25.951 --> 06:29.019
and that's fucking awesome, but
I gotta be honest with you.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.521
This... This is...

06:30.523 --> 06:32.759
It's fucking disgusting. Uh...

06:38.029 --> 06:40.264
- Jim.
- What?

06:40.266 --> 06:41.934
Before you leave, I, uh...

06:43.569 --> 06:45.071
I sketched you last night.

06:46.805 --> 06:48.674
From what I hear,
it's more of a parting gift.

06:54.512 --> 06:57.848
- I don't want it.
- I don't actually know what you look like naked.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.550
I just paint what I feel
you look like naked.

07:00.552 --> 07:02.551
This is so not cool, Henry.

07:02.553 --> 07:03.921
Like, really not cool.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.788
- I liked him.
- No, you didn't.

07:05.790 --> 07:07.623
Not for you to decide.

07:07.625 --> 07:08.959
And no more drawings.

07:08.961 --> 07:11.527
Not unless you've known
someone for at least a year.

07:11.529 --> 07:14.031
That's like three people.

07:14.033 --> 07:16.733
Well, you're stuck drawing
naked pictures of me, then.

07:16.735 --> 07:17.937
That's your punishment.

07:21.572 --> 07:25.274
Did somebody pee? I smell pee.
Did someone pee on my jacket?

07:25.276 --> 07:27.444
Yeah, there it is. Gross.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.817
He called last night, too.

07:33.819 --> 07:35.819
Did you answer?

07:35.821 --> 07:37.454
It's okay if you did.
I just want to know.

07:37.456 --> 07:38.956
I didn't.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.760
How long are you
gonna screen him?

07:52.437 --> 07:54.805
So, what time today?

07:54.807 --> 07:59.709
You better figure I'll get a
detention, so to be safe, 5:00?

07:59.711 --> 08:00.776
Maybe today you won't.

08:00.778 --> 08:02.512
We're running the mile.

08:02.514 --> 08:05.182
It'll be me and all the girls on
their period trailing the rear.

08:05.184 --> 08:09.586
Okay, well, just try not to do
anything stupid, just for this week.

08:09.588 --> 08:10.820
Uh, I don't want to see
that principal again.

08:12.324 --> 08:14.393
- What will you give me?
- My love.

08:15.026 --> 08:16.461
I already have it.

08:46.524 --> 08:49.060
- Good morning, Mr. Buckner, Jenn.
- Hi.

08:49.794 --> 08:51.328
Griselda.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.829
Can I see Sofia for a minute?

08:52.831 --> 08:54.631
You're late
for work again, Laura.

08:54.633 --> 08:56.432
You have five minutes.

08:56.434 --> 08:59.136
And don't say anything
about her skin.

08:59.138 --> 09:00.339
Her skin?

09:02.475 --> 09:04.710
- Sandrine, that's for you.
- Thank you.

09:05.811 --> 09:08.044
- Serg?
- Hey.

09:08.046 --> 09:10.314
- Not again.
- Please?

09:10.316 --> 09:11.884
- Can you watch her just for a minute?
- Oh...

09:13.184 --> 09:16.520
Hey, beautiful.

09:16.522 --> 09:18.254
Yeah, just don't drop her
in a pot.

09:18.256 --> 09:19.989
Put her under your shirt.

09:19.991 --> 09:21.560
- Keep her warm.
- Oh, with the rest of them?

09:24.096 --> 09:25.364
Hey.

09:26.932 --> 09:28.831
And the school is amazing.

09:28.833 --> 09:30.901
They actually
emphasize the arts.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.869
Uh, physical education isn't
even a part of their curriculum,

09:33.871 --> 09:37.007
you know, which for Henry
is very meaningful.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.508
I... I know it's a lot of
money, but I could work it off

09:39.510 --> 09:42.344
while Henry goes to school.

09:42.346 --> 09:44.414
Yeah,
it is very expensive, Laura.

09:44.416 --> 09:46.382
I know.

09:46.384 --> 09:50.386
I know. I wouldn't be asking if you
weren't the only person I could ask.

09:52.857 --> 09:56.225
Oh, it's another RSVP
for True's sweet 16.

09:56.227 --> 09:58.597
God, that makes 150.

10:00.032 --> 10:01.598
Is anyone not coming?

10:01.600 --> 10:03.233
I mean, you want all these
things for your kids,

10:03.235 --> 10:05.471
and then you get them, there's
another whole set of problems.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.276
You're looking at my skin,
aren't you?

10:13.278 --> 10:16.579
Oh, there's just
one little piece.

10:16.581 --> 10:19.116
No, no, no, the doctor said you have
to let it all come off naturally.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.884
That's why the new skin
looks so young and fragile.

10:21.886 --> 10:24.253
I know. Yeah, but there's
just one little piece.

10:24.255 --> 10:26.656
Yeah, yeah, do I try and pick the
animal hair off your sweaters?

10:26.658 --> 10:28.892
No, because there's too much.

10:28.894 --> 10:31.761
Ew, Mom, I literally
can't look at you.

10:31.763 --> 10:33.095
That better heal
before my party.

10:33.097 --> 10:34.964
No, no, it's practically
healed now.

10:34.966 --> 10:36.266
Look.

10:36.268 --> 10:37.670
Sisters.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.302
You are disgusting.

10:40.304 --> 10:41.403
What?

10:41.405 --> 10:42.772
Did you book
the white tiger?

10:42.774 --> 10:45.474
I was planning on it,
and just as I was about to,

10:45.476 --> 10:48.210
I thought to myself,
does a white tiger really want

10:48.212 --> 10:49.879
- to attend a sweet 16?
- Yes.

10:49.881 --> 10:52.882
Because Kayla Drew had one at her
party, and it was, like, amazing.

10:52.884 --> 10:55.886
Yeah, well, they are on... On
the endangered species list.

10:55.888 --> 10:57.954
And just because one guy
probably illegally

10:57.956 --> 10:59.890
has one that he rents out
to parties...

10:59.892 --> 11:02.157
- Yes, you're going to book it, right?
- Sure.

11:02.159 --> 11:06.796
Uh, although, you may be losing Henry
and some other animal lovers as guests.

11:06.798 --> 11:09.098
I wasn't really planning
on inviting Henry.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.334
It's just not really
his crowd, you know?

11:11.336 --> 11:14.203
Besides, I saw him having lunch
with a squirrel last week.

11:14.205 --> 11:15.504
They were talking
and everything.

11:15.506 --> 11:17.007
It was really weird.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.840
I have to go get a mani-pedi.

11:18.842 --> 11:20.078
See you bitches later.

11:21.379 --> 11:23.879
With a squirrel, Laura. Oh...

11:23.881 --> 11:25.815
It's fine.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.345
Did she pick up?

11:56.347 --> 11:59.382
- She did not.
- Surprise, surprise.

11:59.384 --> 12:03.619
Well, I'm afraid
the decision is final, Jack.

12:03.621 --> 12:08.223
We can't have men of such low moral
integrity bringing down the place.

12:08.225 --> 12:10.126
Oh, please.

12:10.128 --> 12:13.897
You geriatric sons of bitches know
that this place is a total shit box.

12:13.899 --> 12:17.834
Uh, we may not have much, but
we do have respect for the law.

12:17.836 --> 12:20.936
Oh, I'm afraid I find that
quality very overrated.

12:20.938 --> 12:22.772
Then off you go.

12:22.774 --> 12:25.208
Be sure to send us a postcard from
whatever jail cell you end up in.

12:25.210 --> 12:28.877
I think we should give Jack
one more chance.

12:28.879 --> 12:30.482
Third time's a charm.

12:32.417 --> 12:34.050
I appreciate it.

12:34.052 --> 12:37.719
Perhaps we should all take a
page out of Harriet's playbook.

12:37.721 --> 12:40.022
Oh, cut the bullshit, Jack.

12:40.024 --> 12:44.629
We tried to make it work, but you
really shit the bed this time, Jack.

12:53.370 --> 12:54.807
Ms. Jaconi.

12:56.107 --> 12:57.308
Uh...

13:07.619 --> 13:09.552
This clearly was an accident.

13:09.554 --> 13:12.888
Henry would never intentionally
slap anyone. Right, Henry?

13:12.890 --> 13:16.461
Well, I meant to slap Jeremy, but she
dove in front of him like he was Obama.

13:17.629 --> 13:20.162
Henry, why slap?

13:20.164 --> 13:21.631
Boys really
shouldn't be slapping.

13:21.633 --> 13:24.434
Slapping is a distant cousin
to hair pulling.

13:24.436 --> 13:26.903
Well, I thought it would
be better than scratching.

13:26.905 --> 13:28.304
Okay, well,
that's hard to say,

13:28.306 --> 13:30.140
but the more important point
here is,

13:30.142 --> 13:32.809
is Henry clearly would never
hit a woman on purpose.

13:32.811 --> 13:35.512
All right? He's been raised by a
single mom, for Christ's sakes.

13:35.514 --> 13:37.182
But he would hit
a faculty member?

13:38.917 --> 13:40.786
I think
that's been established.

13:45.123 --> 13:48.057
Could we start
Henry's suspension next week?

13:48.059 --> 13:50.093
I have potentially
a very hectic week.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.896
Henry is not suspended.
He's expelled.

13:52.898 --> 13:54.332
Expelled? Why?

13:55.567 --> 13:57.767
For this.

13:57.769 --> 14:01.570
Henry requires more attention
than we can provide.

14:01.572 --> 14:04.473
I gave you the list of
specialty schools last month.

14:04.475 --> 14:06.678
I suggest you start
making some phone calls.

14:11.015 --> 14:13.150
What am I doing wrong, Henry?

14:13.152 --> 14:15.318
- What?
- Nothing.

14:15.320 --> 14:18.121
Well, I'm obviously
doing something.

14:18.123 --> 14:20.055
You know, we can't afford
a private school.

14:20.057 --> 14:21.858
Then I'll just drop out
and take my GED.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.660
Not an option.
You are graduating.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.229
- You didn't.
- Well, and look at me.

14:26.231 --> 14:28.363
I didn't raise you
to be like me.

14:28.365 --> 14:30.632
The whole point of kids is
to make them better than you

14:30.634 --> 14:33.136
so they can support you
later in life.

14:33.138 --> 14:37.641
- I thought we'd be roommates for life.
- That's weird.

14:37.643 --> 14:40.642
I want a guest cottage in the back
where you and your wife live.

14:40.644 --> 14:41.911
Or your husband.

14:41.913 --> 14:44.046
Jesus, I'm not gay.

14:44.048 --> 14:45.884
How many times
do I have to tell you that?

14:51.121 --> 14:52.390
Ignore this.

15:00.131 --> 15:01.632
I want you to be happy.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.701
Would a specialty school
make you happy?

15:04.635 --> 15:06.736
I don't know.

15:06.738 --> 15:10.276
- Would the other kids be weird like me?
- Probably. Weirder, even.

15:11.743 --> 15:13.078
I think I'd like it.

15:13.644 --> 15:15.177
Yeah.

15:15.179 --> 15:17.013
I fucking hate Taylor Swift.

15:17.015 --> 15:18.781
Well, she actually writes
her own songs.

15:18.783 --> 15:20.550
She's pretty cool, sweetie.

15:25.791 --> 15:27.393
But I see what you mean.

15:27.926 --> 15:29.328
Yeah.

15:50.948 --> 15:52.083
Hmm...

16:06.697 --> 16:09.400
Oh, you finally called me back.

16:11.970 --> 16:13.572
I need help.

16:15.573 --> 16:18.176
- With Henry. I need money.
- <i>How much?</i>

16:19.410 --> 16:21.945
- A lot.
- <i>Well...</i>

16:21.947 --> 16:24.716
I'm in trouble, too. Maybe
you didn't think of that.

16:28.452 --> 16:30.653
You got kicked out
of your home, didn't you?

16:30.655 --> 16:32.921
Yeah, all that bullshit
about my side ventures

16:32.923 --> 16:36.425
not being up to their standards.
Please!

16:36.427 --> 16:38.127
<i>Anyways, uh...</i>

16:38.129 --> 16:40.629
I've got to find
somewhere to crash,

16:40.631 --> 16:44.666
or they'll put me in a state-run
home with all the loony tunes.

16:44.668 --> 16:46.301
No, you can't, Dad.
You can't stay here.

16:46.303 --> 16:48.171
I gotta look out
for me and Henry.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.671
Uh, why don't I help you?

16:49.673 --> 16:51.610
You get me out
of here, I get you the money.

16:54.980 --> 16:56.244
You have that kind of money?

16:56.246 --> 16:57.613
<i>I could get it.</i>

16:57.615 --> 17:00.316
Look, uh, I'm in a bit
of a situation here, Laura.

17:00.318 --> 17:01.850
I don't know how
to get out of this one.

17:01.852 --> 17:03.352
Well, I...

17:03.354 --> 17:05.287
I'm sure you'll figure
something out.

17:05.289 --> 17:12.827
Anyways, I have until 10:00 tomorrow
morning before they ship me off.

17:12.829 --> 17:14.332
I haven't given up yet.

17:26.644 --> 17:28.710
Hold on. I gotta take this,
you guys.

17:28.712 --> 17:30.313
Stand by.

17:31.482 --> 17:32.548
Jojo here.

17:32.550 --> 17:34.083
Jojo, it's Laura.

17:34.085 --> 17:35.684
Laura!

17:35.686 --> 17:38.054
You'll never guess
what I watched last night.

17:38.056 --> 17:39.823
<i>Karate Kid.</i>

17:39.825 --> 17:44.059
Remember when you used to call me
Jojo-san, and I'd call you Laura-san?

17:45.329 --> 17:46.930
It's from <i>Karate Kid.</i>

17:46.932 --> 17:48.864
- It's a movie.
- <i>Listen to me, Jojo.</i>

17:48.866 --> 17:50.365
Dad got kicked out
of his home.

17:50.367 --> 17:52.234
He needs a place to stay.

17:52.236 --> 17:54.871
Oh, no. Papa-san.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.738
What did he do?

17:56.740 --> 17:59.074
Watch it!

17:59.076 --> 18:02.745
Hey, who knows? I have no idea.
He fucked up again.

18:02.747 --> 18:06.884
But I... I'm picking him up, and
I need him to stay with you.

18:07.818 --> 18:09.719
I don't know, Laura.

18:09.721 --> 18:12.087
Last time Dad
stayed with me,

18:12.089 --> 18:14.891
the FBI followed me
to work for a week.

18:14.893 --> 18:17.160
It was really intense.

18:17.162 --> 18:20.363
I would take him, but he is a
horrible example for Henry.

18:20.365 --> 18:21.831
You gotta agree
with me on that.

18:21.833 --> 18:23.566
<i>Yeah, I do, I do.</i>

18:26.070 --> 18:28.104
Does this mean
I'll get to see you guys?

18:28.106 --> 18:29.805
No, I would put him
on a plane.

18:29.807 --> 18:33.142
Laura, please come.
Oh, It would be so fun.

18:34.811 --> 18:38.413
We could watch <i>Karate Kid,</i> you know?
We could eat Captain Crunch.

18:38.415 --> 18:40.115
- Next time.
- <i>Hey, does Henry</i>

18:40.117 --> 18:42.719
<i>still take pictures
of dead animals?</i>

18:42.721 --> 18:46.255
No. No,
he just draws people naked.

18:46.257 --> 18:48.591
<i>Oh, that's sweet.</i>

18:48.593 --> 18:51.930
Well, I hope he has
enough energy to draw me.

18:54.898 --> 18:56.767
Oh, fuck!

18:59.471 --> 19:00.605
Oh...

19:02.273 --> 19:04.140
They haven't taken him yet,
have they?

19:04.142 --> 19:05.241
Taken who?

19:05.243 --> 19:06.542
Jack Jaconi, my father.

19:06.544 --> 19:07.977
Oh, he should be out
any minute.

19:07.979 --> 19:09.911
He said that you
were coming for him.

19:09.913 --> 19:11.247
He said I was coming?

19:11.249 --> 19:14.819
Yeah, he said you'd be here
at 10:00 on the dot.

19:15.720 --> 19:16.922
Of course, he did.

19:17.654 --> 19:19.989
You got played.

19:19.991 --> 19:22.260
What's the scowl for?

19:23.661 --> 19:25.061
You knew I was coming?

19:25.063 --> 19:27.430
I had a feeling.

19:27.432 --> 19:30.333
Uh, she's very moody, my daughter.
Always has been.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.667
Hey, Hoight.

19:31.669 --> 19:33.969
Come with me. I want to
say goodbye to my garden.

19:33.971 --> 19:36.205
I probably shouldn't leave
my mom.

19:36.207 --> 19:38.107
- Of course, you should.
- No. Excuse me.

19:38.109 --> 19:39.642
Please don't write that.
Please don't...

19:39.644 --> 19:41.978
Give her a chance to stop that
cop from writing her a ticket.

19:41.980 --> 19:44.213
Ten bucks. Ten bucks.

19:44.215 --> 19:47.717
I bet you can hardly believe,

19:47.719 --> 19:51.286
considering your mother can barely
keep a piece of hair alive,

19:51.288 --> 19:54.692
that your grandfather's
got a green thumb.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.692
I'm not really into gardening.

19:57.694 --> 20:00.464
Well, maybe what's in the shed
will change your mind.

20:01.633 --> 20:03.402
I'm too old to molest,
you know.

20:04.301 --> 20:06.302
Oh, Jesus Christ.

20:06.304 --> 20:09.972
You couldn't get molested
with a bow in your hair.

20:09.974 --> 20:13.477
Even pedophiles know to steer
clear of your bad vibes.

20:15.011 --> 20:16.548
Know what this is?

20:18.148 --> 20:20.283
Holy shit.

20:20.285 --> 20:25.824
This is not the shwag
weed you cheapos smoke.

20:27.959 --> 20:29.491
No, sir.

20:29.493 --> 20:34.063
Uh, a French whore I once
admired fed a bud to my cat,

20:34.065 --> 20:37.533
and she shit out
one of the seeds.

20:37.535 --> 20:40.272
Oh, yeah,
this is the good stuff.

20:43.008 --> 20:45.341
It came from a cat's ass?

20:45.343 --> 20:46.709
Well, yeah, had to.

20:46.711 --> 20:48.844
How else was I going to
get it in the country?

20:48.846 --> 20:50.613
I don't know.

20:50.615 --> 20:56.753
Now, I need you
to put this down your pants.

20:56.755 --> 20:59.491
Yeah? Can you do that for me?

21:00.858 --> 21:03.424
Why don't you put it
down your pants?

21:03.426 --> 21:07.330
Because I am wearing
adult diapers.

21:07.332 --> 21:11.065
Just stuff it in,
you little chickenshit.

21:11.067 --> 21:15.203
Your mother's about to give me a real
hard time for taking the Rolls-Royce,

21:15.205 --> 21:20.111
so I need something to get
her voice out of my head.

21:21.712 --> 21:23.411
Absolutely not.

21:23.413 --> 21:25.014
It's all I got.

21:25.016 --> 21:26.218
Then you drive it.

21:28.519 --> 21:31.554
We had a deal. I get you to
L.A., you get me the money.

21:31.556 --> 21:33.722
If you want to keep the car
so bad, then you drive it.

21:33.724 --> 21:37.427
Yeah, those assholes over at
DMV took my license away.

21:37.429 --> 21:39.161
I couldn't pass the eye exam.

21:39.163 --> 21:43.967
And I was hoping we could
use some time together.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.235
Yes, we could.
Twenty years ago.

21:46.237 --> 21:47.670
It's not happening, Dad.

21:47.672 --> 21:49.605
I got you
the plane ticket already,

21:49.607 --> 21:51.740
so send the money
when you land.

21:51.742 --> 21:53.010
Come on, Henry.

21:54.346 --> 21:57.479
I have set a boundary.

21:57.481 --> 22:01.116
It's set. It's a line in the sand.
In the concrete, actually.

22:01.118 --> 22:02.820
I'm not driving
that heap cross-country.

22:06.656 --> 22:08.824
You are not commandeering
this trip already.

22:08.826 --> 22:10.759
You have done nothing
to earn this.

22:10.761 --> 22:12.929
- And we're doing you a favor.
- Well, I appreciate that,

22:12.931 --> 22:15.663
but I'd like to spend
some time with you two.

22:15.665 --> 22:17.834
I hardly know Hoight.

22:17.836 --> 22:20.936
And I'd like to discover
more things I like about you.

22:20.938 --> 22:22.304
Oh, God.

22:22.306 --> 22:24.875
Hey, look. Laura.

22:25.777 --> 22:27.477
I...

22:27.479 --> 22:30.548
I didn't want to tell you
this, actually, but...

22:32.083 --> 22:34.152
Uh, the truth is...

22:35.119 --> 22:36.921
I haven't much time left.

22:44.295 --> 22:46.062
I'm... I'm dying, Laura.

22:46.064 --> 22:48.998
The doctor gave me the news
a few days ago.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.834
My prostate cancer's
come back.

22:51.836 --> 22:54.903
I'd be a goner on a plane.

22:54.905 --> 22:56.671
I've got a blood clot
in my leg,

22:56.673 --> 22:58.340
and when we get
to high elevation,

22:58.342 --> 23:01.911
it could...
Go straight to my heart.

23:01.913 --> 23:03.214
That's where it's headed.

23:05.016 --> 23:07.549
This is a trick. This is
another one of your schemes.

23:07.551 --> 23:08.853
I wish it was.

23:10.989 --> 23:12.721
So, why didn't you tell me?

23:12.723 --> 23:15.123
I didn't want to...
Didn't want to worry you.

23:15.125 --> 23:16.392
I knew how busy you are.

23:16.394 --> 23:18.693
It doesn't matter.
You should have told me.

23:18.695 --> 23:20.598
Well, I am, now.

23:24.902 --> 23:26.270
What do you say?

23:28.472 --> 23:31.842
How about spending
some time together?

23:36.213 --> 23:37.648
You're dying?

23:38.348 --> 23:39.849
Sure as hell am.

23:39.851 --> 23:40.952
Really dying?

23:41.585 --> 23:43.221
Stage-four dying.

23:51.363 --> 23:53.164
I will be on my cell
the whole time.

23:54.097 --> 23:55.396
And how many days?

23:55.398 --> 23:56.766
Like, two at the most.

23:56.768 --> 23:57.967
Three at the very, very most.

23:57.969 --> 23:59.134
What about the party?

23:59.136 --> 24:01.738
I'll be back
to help with the deliveries.

24:01.740 --> 24:04.974
Just give me something good,
like boils or meningitis.

24:04.976 --> 24:06.642
- Can that go away in two days?
- Oh...

24:06.644 --> 24:10.113
- How often do I feed this one?
- Every four hours.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.215
- 24/7?
- Anything you want. Literally.

24:12.217 --> 24:14.616
My son. My good organs.
I owe you my life.

24:14.618 --> 24:16.654
I want a date.

24:18.388 --> 24:19.457
I said anything you want.

24:20.458 --> 24:21.960
I want a date with you.

24:24.694 --> 24:28.631
No, I am a mess. I can't...
I can't date people I like.

24:28.633 --> 24:29.899
It wouldn't be fair to them.

24:29.901 --> 24:31.135
Well, I won't do it.

24:32.303 --> 24:33.738
You want a date?

24:34.672 --> 24:36.575
- With me? With this?
- Yes.

24:37.141 --> 24:39.240
Yes.

24:39.242 --> 24:41.411
I have faith that I haven't
seen the best of you.

24:41.413 --> 24:43.078
Laura!

24:43.080 --> 24:45.817
Shit! Okay.
Just give me something good.

24:47.251 --> 24:48.720
- Go.
- Okay.

24:51.588 --> 24:53.422
Why did he only take
five of them?

24:53.424 --> 24:55.490
It's a horror show back there.

24:55.492 --> 24:57.927
Well, these have more special
needs than the others.

24:57.929 --> 24:59.961
Well, one need
should be a new face.

24:59.963 --> 25:02.797
Those are two of the ugliest
dogs I've ever seen.

25:09.773 --> 25:11.807
<i>♪♪ I wanna rock now</i>

25:11.809 --> 25:13.477
<i>♪♪ Rock this joint tonight</i>

25:15.946 --> 25:18.581
<i>♪♪ Oh, I wanna rock now</i>

25:18.583 --> 25:20.485
<i>♪♪ Rock this joint tonight</i>

25:23.186 --> 25:25.121
<i>♪♪ I feel like partying ♪♪</i>

25:25.123 --> 25:28.356
- There's an old bow and arrow back here.
- Uh, uh, uh, don't touch.

25:28.358 --> 25:31.395
I'm trying to get on <i>Antiques Roadshow.</i>
That's worth a fortune!

25:32.997 --> 25:35.631
Or nothing. I'm not positive.

25:37.335 --> 25:39.037
Why is the car shaking?

25:41.404 --> 25:43.238
Did you fill her up
before we started?

25:43.240 --> 25:44.974
Why would I fill it up?

25:44.976 --> 25:47.843
Well, who goes on a road trip
without filling up the tank?

25:47.845 --> 25:49.280
It's not even my car!

25:52.349 --> 25:55.316
Hey. Be calm, be calm.

25:55.318 --> 25:57.920
How can I stay calm?
We're gonna get rear-ended.

25:57.922 --> 26:00.355
- Can I get over there?
- Yeah, yeah, now.

26:07.398 --> 26:09.097
You better get out and push.

26:09.099 --> 26:12.436
- Me? Why not you?
- I'm 85. I don't push.

26:25.849 --> 26:27.217
God damn it.

26:33.090 --> 26:34.690
I've got to
change my diaper.

26:34.692 --> 26:36.426
I'll see you
chickenshits later.

26:44.701 --> 26:45.834
I have emotional amnesia.

26:45.836 --> 26:48.036
I don't know why
I said yes to this.

26:48.038 --> 26:50.442
Mom, you just need
to stick to the course, okay?

26:51.375 --> 26:53.074
Okay.

26:53.076 --> 26:56.545
Oregon tonight, San Francisco
tomorrow, L.A. on Friday, okay?

26:56.547 --> 26:58.613
If we, if we just stick
to the schedule exactly,

26:58.615 --> 27:00.585
this will be a blip
in our lives.

27:04.654 --> 27:07.488
Oh, God, I had a feeling.

27:07.490 --> 27:10.459
Oh, God. I knew this was
that kind of a neighborhood.

27:10.461 --> 27:11.561
I knew it.

27:11.563 --> 27:12.661
What kind of neighborhood?

27:12.663 --> 27:14.833
The kind that doesn't spay
or neuter.

27:16.701 --> 27:18.234
He looks like a runner.

27:18.236 --> 27:20.737
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no!

27:20.739 --> 27:22.771
Stay.

27:22.773 --> 27:24.440
Mom,
we have too many dogs.

27:24.442 --> 27:27.075
I know, Henry. Jesus.
I live in our house.

27:27.077 --> 27:29.146
Relax. I'm just saying.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.546
Okay. All right.

27:31.548 --> 27:33.716
If I...
If I call it over and it runs,

27:33.718 --> 27:36.117
then... Then we just
let it run, right?

27:36.119 --> 27:38.220
It does look like a runner.
It's definitely a runner.

27:38.222 --> 27:40.055
And I don't have my good shoes
or my kit,

27:40.057 --> 27:42.257
so I'm not going to go chase
after it, right?

27:42.259 --> 27:44.459
That's a runner
if I ever saw one.

27:44.461 --> 27:45.697
Yeah, it's gonna run.

27:48.298 --> 27:49.834
Come here, puppy.

27:50.500 --> 27:52.369
Come here.

27:52.804 --> 27:54.303
Fuck.

27:54.305 --> 27:57.174
No tag, no collar.

27:58.276 --> 28:00.843
She's been on the streets
for a while.

28:00.845 --> 28:04.680
Oh, God, she's cute.
Don't look at her.

28:04.682 --> 28:07.150
- Who the hell's that?
- Nobody.

28:07.152 --> 28:10.052
Nobody. She probably belongs to
the owner across the street.

28:10.054 --> 28:12.157
Well, maybe she belongs
to the gas station.

28:14.991 --> 28:16.326
She belongs to me.

28:16.961 --> 28:18.229
They all do.

28:19.963 --> 28:22.797
Can't you tell?
She knew I would be here.

28:22.799 --> 28:25.467
She knew. She knew.
They all know.

28:25.469 --> 28:27.505
All of them. They all know.

28:29.807 --> 28:31.641
Jesus.

28:31.643 --> 28:34.276
You're like the Pied Piper
of mange.

28:37.981 --> 28:41.551
<i>♪♪ Congratulations, honey</i>

28:41.553 --> 28:44.322
<i>♪♪ If you found somebody new</i>

28:45.690 --> 28:52.929
<i>♪♪ Yeah, congratulations, honey
If you found... ♪♪</i>

28:52.931 --> 28:54.595
Well, that took
barely a minute,

28:54.597 --> 28:56.701
and we picked up a dog
along the way.

28:58.999 --> 28:59.602
I'd call it a success.

28:59.604 --> 29:03.037
Yeah, that's exactly how I envisioned
the first hour of this trip.

29:03.039 --> 29:06.542
One more thing to hide
from my therapist.

29:06.544 --> 29:09.577
Where did you
get this negativity?

29:09.579 --> 29:11.380
You used to laugh more.

29:11.382 --> 29:14.516
- I used to be able to make you laugh.
- You never made me laugh.

29:14.518 --> 29:16.051
I was always laughing.

29:16.053 --> 29:17.753
Yeah, at me.

29:17.755 --> 29:20.892
Well, I had to.
It was either that or cry.

29:22.493 --> 29:24.692
You better let go
of some of that anger,

29:24.694 --> 29:28.063
or you'll end up
a pissed-off old spinster.

29:28.065 --> 29:30.999
You're about one
four-legged creature away.

29:32.769 --> 29:34.471
Dad. Dad.

29:36.441 --> 29:39.408
Oh, that's so funny!

29:39.410 --> 29:42.044
Oh, thank you, Father.
Thank you so much.

29:42.046 --> 29:45.447
Like... Like I need to worry
about being a spinster,

29:45.449 --> 29:48.217
on top of all the other things that
I'm constantly worrying about.

29:48.219 --> 29:49.852
That's... That's...

29:49.854 --> 29:52.487
I mean, as if there isn't
enough social media

29:52.489 --> 29:55.324
telling me that I need
to find a man. Yeah.

29:55.326 --> 29:57.625
What? What?
I'm not getting the signals!

29:57.627 --> 30:00.228
What? What? I need a man?

30:00.230 --> 30:03.866
How bad is it to be alone?
I can't hear. What?

30:04.999 --> 30:06.671
Oh... See? I still laugh.

30:07.837 --> 30:10.139
I didn't buy it.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.677
<i>♪♪ Just as glad as I could be</i>

30:13.510 --> 30:16.277
<i>♪♪ Yeah
Oh, yeah</i>

30:16.279 --> 30:19.314
<i>♪♪ Go along
and have your fun... ♪♪</i>

30:19.316 --> 30:20.915
Where are we?
Where did... Where...

30:20.917 --> 30:24.286
Is there really
a CPK around here?

30:24.288 --> 30:27.157
What is going on?
Did you change my navigation?

30:27.625 --> 30:29.257
Huh?

30:29.259 --> 30:31.095
Did you change this?

30:31.628 --> 30:33.328
Yeah.

30:33.330 --> 30:35.396
This is the wrong route.

30:35.398 --> 30:36.466
What... Did you do this?

30:40.237 --> 30:42.238
You changed it? Henry!

30:42.240 --> 30:44.773
He gave me $20 when you
were in the gas station.

30:44.775 --> 30:46.508
Okay, no.

30:46.510 --> 30:49.478
No, there's not gonna be any weird
little pit stops along the way.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.613
No, we have to make it
to California by Friday.

30:51.615 --> 30:52.849
- Well...
- No.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.382
Stanley is already
expecting us.

30:54.384 --> 30:56.183
He may even have dinner ready.

30:56.185 --> 31:00.388
Stanley, art forger Stanley? No,
he's involved in illegal activity.

31:00.390 --> 31:02.624
I don't want Henry anywhere near him.
Absolutely not.

31:02.626 --> 31:04.459
We have to be in California
by Friday.

31:04.461 --> 31:06.396
What kind of illegal activity?

31:07.898 --> 31:09.297
Well, the good kind,
of course.

31:09.299 --> 31:13.501
Absolutely not. No.
We are staying at a Red Roof.

31:13.503 --> 31:16.505
The only known criminal we're
spending time with is you.

31:24.015 --> 31:25.980
Well, we're here.

31:25.982 --> 31:29.019
I hope that line of yours
is powder.

31:30.119 --> 31:33.988
Hey! Shit.

31:33.990 --> 31:36.360
Here's the son of a bitch.

31:38.695 --> 31:40.696
Oh, man.

31:40.698 --> 31:43.164
- Who are these people?
- Old friends of your grandfather's.

31:43.166 --> 31:44.568
Don't inhale anything.

31:46.135 --> 31:48.469
Well, hello.

31:48.471 --> 31:50.575
- Hi, Stan.
- Don't you look beautiful.

31:53.978 --> 31:56.547
Oh. You look
just like your mother.

31:57.780 --> 32:00.048
God rest her soul.

32:00.050 --> 32:03.754
Where is your precious
little baby?

32:04.555 --> 32:05.622
Hi.

32:06.088 --> 32:07.325
Oh, my God.

32:08.759 --> 32:10.795
Isn't he gorgeous?

32:11.528 --> 32:14.563
Hey. Come on in.

32:14.565 --> 32:16.097
You remember Jed?

32:16.099 --> 32:18.299
- Hi, Jed.
- Hey! Hey!

32:18.301 --> 32:21.370
Hey, give me a hug,
you old cripple.

32:21.372 --> 32:23.872
- I like you, Jack.
- I know you do.

32:23.874 --> 32:26.609
He's been talking about you
for two days straight.

32:26.611 --> 32:29.914
They Skype each other
every Saturday night.

32:30.815 --> 32:32.748
Jack, will you Skype with me?

32:32.750 --> 32:34.949
Well, no,
now I'm here in person.

32:34.951 --> 32:39.453
You can see how handsome I am,
you know, so close up.

32:39.455 --> 32:42.892
Uh, tell Jed, uh, to show you
his room, Laura.

32:42.894 --> 32:45.626
Okay. All right.
But only just for a minute,

32:45.628 --> 32:47.763
because this was supposed
to be a very quick trip.

32:47.765 --> 32:51.033
Oh, nonsense.
I've got dinner on the stove,

32:51.035 --> 32:53.936
and the guest room sheets
have barely been slept in.

32:53.938 --> 32:57.972
- Oh, wonderful.
- Yeah, be there in a minute, Stan.

32:57.974 --> 33:01.311
Yeah, I'm on it, Sofia. Prada
wallets for the gift bags. Done.

33:02.680 --> 33:06.280
Um, no, yes,
boils are very contagious,

33:06.282 --> 33:08.784
but I think it's best that I
work from home for a few days.

33:08.786 --> 33:10.451
No, don't be concerned
about yourself.

33:10.453 --> 33:12.019
I'm sure it's just
an ingrown hair.

33:12.021 --> 33:14.155
Okay, thanks. Bye.

33:14.157 --> 33:15.623
- Sorry.
- A little more. A little more.

33:15.625 --> 33:16.994
Sorry, it's just my boss.

33:18.929 --> 33:23.164
Making the deals and mergers.

33:23.166 --> 33:27.268
I always knew you'd be
a successful businesswoman.

33:27.270 --> 33:29.671
- I'm not a businesswoman.
- No, she's an executive.

33:29.673 --> 33:32.274
Assistant.
I'm an executive assistant.

33:32.276 --> 33:35.513
Yeah, well,
"executive" is in it, yeah?

33:42.118 --> 33:43.986
This tastes like candy corn.

33:43.988 --> 33:47.959
Well, it should, because
it's a candy corn casserole.

33:49.625 --> 33:51.159
- Really?
- Hmm.

33:51.161 --> 33:54.028
Jed loves candy corn.

33:54.030 --> 33:57.034
Every bite
has something sweet.

33:59.303 --> 34:01.036
I like candy corn, Jack.

34:01.038 --> 34:04.907
So do I, Jed.
Not only on Halloween.

34:04.909 --> 34:07.409
It's been too long.

34:07.411 --> 34:11.179
What happened to that
wonderful husband of yours?

34:11.181 --> 34:12.581
He left us.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.248
No.

34:14.251 --> 34:16.751
Well, he left me,
actually, not Henry.

34:16.753 --> 34:18.853
- He left me, too.
- Oh...

34:18.856 --> 34:25.025
Well, he has chronic fatigue, so basically
he was too tired to love us properly.

34:25.027 --> 34:27.465
Well, I'd still like to
string him up by his feet.

34:28.364 --> 34:31.699
We're all each other has got.

34:31.702 --> 34:33.568
And it just tickles me
to death

34:33.570 --> 34:37.007
to see you and your father
spending time together.

34:38.009 --> 34:40.507
He talks about you
all the time.

34:40.510 --> 34:42.012
Yeah, mostly complaints.

34:43.213 --> 34:44.514
Family.

34:45.849 --> 34:47.784
That's all there is.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.552
Isn't that right, Jed?

34:50.554 --> 34:53.623
- Do you like me, Jack?
- Sure do.

34:55.326 --> 34:59.260
- Are you my friend, Jack?
- Sure am.

34:59.262 --> 35:01.262
Fuck yeah.

35:01.264 --> 35:04.134
I feel the same way.
"Fuck yeah."

35:17.949 --> 35:21.583
Uh, thank you, Hoight.
You're a man of your word.

35:21.585 --> 35:23.153
Now, where did you
put the plant?

35:25.054 --> 35:28.389
What do you mean?
I still have it down my pants.

35:28.391 --> 35:29.860
Oh, geez.

35:33.630 --> 35:35.130
I think it gave me a rash.

35:35.132 --> 35:37.465
I don't want to hear
about your rash.

35:37.467 --> 35:40.971
Now, the point is,
I can trust you, huh?

35:42.440 --> 35:44.008
Do you know why we're here?

35:44.909 --> 35:46.742
To visit Stanley and his son?

35:46.744 --> 35:47.812
That, and?

35:48.713 --> 35:50.515
I don't know. To annoy my mom?

35:51.882 --> 35:53.481
I'm a drug dealer, Hoight.

35:53.483 --> 35:57.987
I know I may look out of my prime,
but I'm just getting started.

35:57.989 --> 36:03.124
There's $200,000 worth
of weed in there.

36:03.126 --> 36:04.561
Go on, now. Take a look.

36:10.266 --> 36:13.934
We've been driving
with this in the car?

36:13.936 --> 36:17.037
- That's real illegal.
- Oh, you sound like your mother.

36:17.039 --> 36:19.141
I thought
I could tell you things.

36:19.143 --> 36:20.976
She's gonna be really pissed.

36:20.978 --> 36:24.248
All my customers are lined up.
I need a partner.

36:25.715 --> 36:28.485
I can't unload it on my own.

36:29.385 --> 36:30.521
Partner?

36:31.288 --> 36:33.155
What kind of partner?

36:33.157 --> 36:35.322
You help me
get rid of the weed,

36:35.324 --> 36:38.427
and I'll send you money
on your birthday.

36:38.429 --> 36:40.494
That's what
normal grandpas do, anyway.

36:40.496 --> 36:43.733
Great. Then you'll be getting
what you've always wanted.

36:48.271 --> 36:51.940
Would we all go to jail
if we got caught, or just you?

36:51.942 --> 36:54.708
Just me, you little shit.

36:54.710 --> 36:57.547
I also wrote a note,
just in case.

36:59.315 --> 37:03.253
"This weed is property of Jack Jaconi.
Thank you for your time."

37:05.621 --> 37:07.524
You think it'll hold up
in court?

37:08.157 --> 37:09.559
It should.

37:13.530 --> 37:16.100
All right. I'll help you.

37:20.936 --> 37:26.643
Well, Lindsay Lohan seems to be
getting her act together, isn't she?

37:28.411 --> 37:32.014
- I'm pulling for her.
- Yeah, me too, Jack.

37:32.016 --> 37:34.452
And Boy George is a Buddhist.

37:35.117 --> 37:37.219
I knew I liked him.

37:37.221 --> 37:40.523
Oh, my God, this kid,
Macaulay Culkin.

37:41.757 --> 37:45.128
Oh, is he going
through some shit.

37:52.902 --> 37:54.302
I'm tired.

37:54.304 --> 37:56.574
- Well, I guess this is good night.
- Oh, yeah.

37:57.240 --> 37:59.374
Sure. Sure is.

38:01.777 --> 38:02.980
Well, good night.

38:03.746 --> 38:04.949
Night.

38:08.585 --> 38:10.751
You know...

38:10.753 --> 38:12.753
I don't want this
to seem like an apology,

38:12.755 --> 38:16.325
but, uh, I shouldn't have
complained about staying here.

38:16.327 --> 38:21.463
You know, Stanley is so nice, and Jed is
great, and it's just nice to see them.

38:21.465 --> 38:25.566
Mm-hmm. Yeah. No problem.

38:25.568 --> 38:31.175
So, uh, so, here's to a super
fun, but straightforward trip.

38:34.844 --> 38:36.946
I'm glad we're getting
to spend some time together.

38:39.115 --> 38:41.418
And thank you for the money.

38:44.922 --> 38:46.153
Okay.

38:46.155 --> 38:49.291
Hey, are you going to
sleep with Loretta?

38:49.293 --> 38:50.461
Why? Do you want to?

38:52.762 --> 38:53.797
Yeah. Why not?

39:06.943 --> 39:09.980
Well, yeah, listen. Yeah.

39:11.148 --> 39:14.215
I'm an asshole, Loretta.

39:14.217 --> 39:16.152
I really am.
I don't deserve this.

39:19.556 --> 39:22.525
You're just like
all the other girls. Huh?

39:24.293 --> 39:26.029
Your heart's too big.

39:33.903 --> 39:38.108
Uh, anyone care to join me
in the Jacuzzi?

39:44.146 --> 39:45.516
No, thank you.

39:46.016 --> 39:48.085
No? Laura.

39:48.851 --> 39:49.987
No, thanks.

39:50.619 --> 39:51.721
Oh...

39:53.222 --> 39:54.557
All right, then.

40:05.202 --> 40:06.437
Good morning!

40:08.137 --> 40:10.139
Where is everyone?

40:10.141 --> 40:12.706
They went
to Little Big Burger.

40:12.708 --> 40:14.441
But it's 7:00 a.m.

40:14.443 --> 40:18.215
Well, you can call them, put
in your order, if you like.

40:23.018 --> 40:24.753
I'm sorry. I'm just nervous.

40:24.755 --> 40:27.889
There's no need to be nervous.
Did you measure it out?

40:27.891 --> 40:29.257
I put it in a diaper bag.

40:29.259 --> 40:33.094
Yeah, good. Good.
I'll, uh, take it from there.

40:33.096 --> 40:36.833
Your only job is to act like you
don't give a shit. Can you do that?

40:48.612 --> 40:51.211
Jed, can you act cool?

40:51.213 --> 40:53.748
Uh, I'm cool.

40:53.750 --> 40:55.119
Take a lesson from Jed.

41:17.273 --> 41:20.043
Jesus. That was cool?

41:21.110 --> 41:22.677
Sorry.

41:22.679 --> 41:25.345
Scared of some Buddhist monks?

41:25.347 --> 41:29.117
I've had more capable partners
in a game of charades.

41:30.788 --> 41:32.056
Goodbye, Jack.

41:33.923 --> 41:35.492
Uh...

41:40.297 --> 41:42.329
That's too much.

41:42.331 --> 41:45.235
Enjoy it, you sly dog.

41:48.137 --> 41:50.171
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

41:50.173 --> 41:51.876
- <i>Arrivederci.</i>
- Bye.

42:12.762 --> 42:16.831
Hey. Hey!
Stop at the next rest stop.

42:16.833 --> 42:18.700
I need to change my diaper.

42:18.702 --> 42:20.568
Okay, you don't have
to say that.

42:20.570 --> 42:22.202
You can just say,
"I have to use the restroom."

42:22.204 --> 42:25.472
- Hoight, hand me a diaper.
- Just saying, you know?

42:25.474 --> 42:27.075
Asking for a diaper
as opposed to

42:27.077 --> 42:29.543
asking for a restroom
is a little candid.

42:29.545 --> 42:31.079
Some people might think
that's rude.

42:31.081 --> 42:34.351
Well, I think they're rude.
Judging a man by his diapers.

42:35.552 --> 42:38.088
I don't like the fact
that I have to wear them.

42:46.429 --> 42:47.896
Sofia, I know
you're frustrated,

42:47.898 --> 42:49.563
but it's going to be
a couple of days. I...

42:49.565 --> 42:51.233
Well, no,
I know you didn't see them,

42:51.235 --> 42:54.068
because they're in my scalp
and on my feet.

42:55.706 --> 42:58.907
<i>♪♪ Cruising on the highway

42:58.909 --> 43:00.708

43:00.710 --> 43:02.844
It's itching

You thought your face... A bunch

What is that smell? Do you smell that?
It smells like pot.

43:19.596 --> 43:22.630
It's patchouli. I wear it now.

43:22.632 --> 43:24.865
Gross.

43:24.867 --> 43:26.903
I think it might attract
a different kind of girl.

43:28.371 --> 43:30.907
Found him near the bathroom.

43:32.242 --> 43:33.708
I think he's a little blind.

43:33.710 --> 43:37.144
What? Why? No, no, no!
We cannot take any more dogs.

43:37.146 --> 43:38.878
Of course you can.

43:38.880 --> 43:41.618

44:34.536 --> 44:37.306
Yeah, you're a pretty
good partner, uh, Hoight.

44:38.942 --> 44:42.844
I never thought of myself as a
drug dealer, but I enjoy it.

44:42.846 --> 44:44.711
I might continue
down this path.

44:44.713 --> 44:47.947
Oh, no, no, no. The drug
dealing isn't for you.

44:47.949 --> 44:52.019
That was a temporary job. You
can move on to better products.

44:52.021 --> 44:54.789
- Like cocaine?
- No.

44:54.791 --> 44:57.161
Like your art,
you little shit.

45:00.329 --> 45:02.028
My drawings freak people out.

45:02.030 --> 45:04.699
Yeah, well,
all good art does that.

45:04.701 --> 45:08.168
Yeah, take a
look, uh, at that fellow, Crumb.

45:08.170 --> 45:11.305
- I mean, he made a decent living.
- Crumb?

45:11.307 --> 45:13.275
Yeah, you know,
the guy who took all that LSD.

45:13.277 --> 45:15.443
I mean, you could do
something like that.

45:15.445 --> 45:17.345
But I don't want
to take a lot of LSD.

45:17.347 --> 45:19.447
You don't have to.

45:19.449 --> 45:23.320
But people will be talking
about your art.

45:25.188 --> 45:27.555
What if they're only saying
bad things?

45:27.557 --> 45:30.726
Doesn't matter. It's the talk.

45:30.728 --> 45:32.728
And, uh, I think that,
you know,

45:32.730 --> 45:36.063
all those
weird drawings you do,

45:36.065 --> 45:38.235
they're all right,
they're all right.

45:40.269 --> 45:43.037
I just don't want to be seen in
one of them one day, you know.

45:43.039 --> 45:44.274
Okay?

45:46.041 --> 45:48.441
I don't know why you
complained about Jack so much.

45:48.443 --> 45:49.776
I like him.

45:49.778 --> 45:51.412
I didn't.

45:51.414 --> 45:54.682
I used to overhear you and Dad
talking about him in the bathroom.

45:54.684 --> 45:56.120
Oh.

45:58.521 --> 46:00.588
Do you miss
having a guy around?

46:00.590 --> 46:01.692
No.

46:06.094 --> 46:08.197
I figured out
how to masturbate on my own.

46:09.065 --> 46:10.898
I just like his vibe.

46:10.900 --> 46:12.534
He said, if he's still alive
next summer,

46:12.536 --> 46:14.769
he'd take me to Venezuela and we'd
hitchhike across the country.

46:14.771 --> 46:17.838
- Oh, yeah?
- Or the Cayman Islands.

46:17.840 --> 46:20.708
He said I really need
to see the Cayman Islands.

46:20.710 --> 46:22.409
Wouldn't get
too attached, sweetheart.

46:22.411 --> 46:24.747
You know, he's just
a temporary situation.

46:27.818 --> 46:29.650
You don't know that.

46:29.652 --> 46:31.887
Maybe I'll want to spend
more time with him after this.

46:31.889 --> 46:34.956
No, I mean we're a temporary
situation for him.

46:34.958 --> 46:38.226
There's a reason
he doesn't know your name.

46:38.228 --> 46:41.929
Maybe he just had to be
reminded of how cool we were,

46:41.931 --> 46:43.634
and he'll want to hang out
with us from now on.

46:48.271 --> 46:49.873
Yeah, maybe.

47:15.599 --> 47:18.898
Oh, sorry.

47:18.900 --> 47:21.871
Blind Poodle wanted
to smoke a little before bed.

47:22.838 --> 47:24.474
Don't hurt my kid.

47:26.509 --> 47:29.909
I'm fine, I got through it,
but he's different.

47:29.911 --> 47:32.179
Jesus, I'm not gonna hurt
the little shit.

47:32.181 --> 47:33.882
Okay, because he's sensitive.

47:33.884 --> 47:36.887
He... He can't handle the
disappointment, okay? And...

47:38.554 --> 47:40.655
And you have more power
than you know.

47:40.657 --> 47:43.490
You... You make people fall in
love with you, and then you leave.

47:43.492 --> 47:44.992
And he's not like me.

47:44.994 --> 47:47.329
Okay, I know the drill. I've
been through it my whole life.

47:47.331 --> 47:48.896
But he's already gotten it
from his dad,

47:48.898 --> 47:50.731
and he doesn't need it
from you, too.

47:50.733 --> 47:52.700
His chronic-fatigue dad?

47:52.702 --> 47:56.038
Well, I never said he was professionally
diagnosed, but, yeah, it could be true.

47:58.373 --> 48:01.811
I'd hate to hear what you told,
uh, the little shit about me.

48:03.447 --> 48:05.481
What did you tell him
about me?

48:07.483 --> 48:11.318
- I said that you were temporary.
- Oh... Oh...

48:11.320 --> 48:13.990
That you are
a temporary situation.

48:15.826 --> 48:18.362
Well, good.
That's about right.

48:19.496 --> 48:20.961
Okay. Well, it's better

48:20.963 --> 48:22.030
- that he knows now.
- Sure.

48:22.032 --> 48:23.463
So this way he will
not be disappointed.

48:23.465 --> 48:24.433
- Sure.
- Okay.

48:42.518 --> 48:44.654
Mom, what's wrong?

48:46.922 --> 48:49.592
I was just imagining what
it would be like if you died.

48:52.896 --> 48:55.229
I was at a funeral, and
there were a lot of people.

48:55.231 --> 48:56.433
I hate it when you do that.

49:01.036 --> 49:05.107
You were in a terrible head-on
collision, and it was a closed casket.

49:05.708 --> 49:07.175
Enough.

49:07.177 --> 49:09.677
I know. I'm sorry.
I can't help it.

49:09.679 --> 49:11.581
I just love you so much.

49:15.452 --> 49:17.017
Well, she's all right,
your mother.

49:17.019 --> 49:18.519
She's doing her best.

49:18.521 --> 49:20.354
Was she always like this?

49:20.356 --> 49:24.758
Well, she's always had a thing about
people who aren't worthy of her.

49:24.760 --> 49:27.461
Yeah. She can't help it.

49:27.463 --> 49:30.197
She... She likes an underdog.

49:30.199 --> 49:32.233
That's why
she likes you so much.

49:32.235 --> 49:35.338
- Well, I don't know about that.
- She does. She told me.

49:37.739 --> 49:40.876
She wants you to live with us
and not with Jojo.

49:42.512 --> 49:43.714
She said that?

49:48.117 --> 49:54.521
Well, I am about to
become her least favorite person

49:54.523 --> 49:56.226
for the 35th year running.

49:56.925 --> 49:58.258
What'd you do now?

49:58.260 --> 50:00.293
Well, you see all this?

50:00.295 --> 50:03.998
Your mom's not going to like
to know who that's going to.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.865
I might need it
to come from you.

50:05.867 --> 50:07.769
I don't know any
of your customers.

50:07.771 --> 50:09.903
- Oh, you know one.
- Who?

50:09.905 --> 50:12.606
Uh, your father.

50:12.608 --> 50:15.742
Yeah, he placed a pretty big order,
and I can't afford to skip it.

50:15.744 --> 50:17.744
But I don't want
to see my dad.

50:17.746 --> 50:20.148
Well, that's a little extreme.

50:20.150 --> 50:23.117
- What did he ever do to you?
- He left us.

50:23.119 --> 50:26.289
Well, he's chronically fatigued.
I mean, give the guy a break.

50:36.431 --> 50:39.833
- So, I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

50:39.835 --> 50:41.501
Since we're gonna
pass through Sausalito...

50:41.503 --> 50:42.702
No.

50:42.704 --> 50:43.905
You don't know what
I'm gonna ask.

50:43.907 --> 50:46.206
- Okay, go ahead.
- No.

50:46.208 --> 50:48.210
- You've already said no.
- Good.

50:53.081 --> 50:55.383
I want to see him.
It's been three years.

50:55.385 --> 50:57.017
Why? Are we not enough?

50:57.019 --> 50:59.121
Uh, don't bring me into this.

51:01.056 --> 51:02.923
Pretend you're a therapist
right now.

51:02.925 --> 51:05.059
- Okay. Do you need closure?
- Yes.

51:05.061 --> 51:06.263
No.

51:09.164 --> 51:11.168
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

51:11.835 --> 51:13.269
No.

51:14.670 --> 51:16.838
The truth is,

51:16.840 --> 51:19.740
I've been feeling like something's
missing for a long time,

51:19.742 --> 51:25.213
and I don't know if he's the answer
or not, but I have questions.

51:25.215 --> 51:27.050
I deserve to know why he left.

51:34.222 --> 51:37.157
You want to know why
I have no friends?

51:37.159 --> 51:40.163
Because the guys in the locker
room call me a bastard.

51:41.463 --> 51:43.363
You didn't tell me that.

51:43.365 --> 51:44.568
Not really.

51:46.068 --> 51:47.769
I didn't want to make you
feel bad.

51:47.771 --> 51:51.037
But I think it explains a lot.

51:51.039 --> 51:54.876
Like why I'm not thriving at
school like we all expected.

51:54.878 --> 51:58.682
Why I'm underweight. School
wasn't a safe space for me, and,

52:00.048 --> 52:02.883
and now
I'm left with questions.

52:02.885 --> 52:05.318
Questions only he can answer.

52:05.320 --> 52:08.990
- I didn't know you cared so much.
- Of course I do.

52:08.992 --> 52:12.963
You know one of the qualities
of my essence is sensitivity.

52:14.797 --> 52:15.929
No.

52:15.931 --> 52:17.067
Shit.

52:19.869 --> 52:22.570
Okay, we can stop. Okay.

52:22.572 --> 52:25.008
And I will be with you
the whole time.

52:29.244 --> 52:32.445

- Are you okay with this?
- You're asking me now?

52:58.340 --> 53:00.974
Well, I know how you
get around him.

53:00.976 --> 53:03.443
It was humiliating
for a father,

53:03.445 --> 53:05.813
seeing you run after him
in high school.

53:05.815 --> 53:07.715
And those posters you made.

53:07.717 --> 53:09.115
- Oh, my God.
- I was 17.

53:09.117 --> 53:11.688
- Yeah, couldn't take a hint, huh?
- Jack Jaconi?

53:12.188 --> 53:13.487
Uh...

53:13.489 --> 53:16.691
Jesus Christ, man.
I was sure you were dead.

53:16.693 --> 53:19.258
And I remember
you being better-looking.

53:19.260 --> 53:21.128
Good thing we're both wrong.

53:21.130 --> 53:23.633
You remember your ex-wife?

53:25.367 --> 53:26.735
Yeah, sure.

53:27.503 --> 53:28.805
Sure I do.

53:31.273 --> 53:33.476
Well, aren't you a sight
for sore eyes.

53:35.344 --> 53:36.746
Hi, Leonard.

53:39.047 --> 53:40.349
Hey, kid.

53:41.717 --> 53:42.918
How old are you now?

53:43.686 --> 53:45.485
You do the math.

53:45.487 --> 53:47.854
He takes a little
getting used to.

53:47.856 --> 53:49.590
Come on with me to the car.

53:49.592 --> 53:51.157
I've got about
14 more dogs there.

53:51.159 --> 53:52.728
You can give me a hand.

53:58.333 --> 54:00.534
How do you want to do this?

54:00.536 --> 54:02.903
Do you want me by your side, or
do you want to talk to him alone?

54:02.905 --> 54:05.572
- I don't really care anymore.
- What?

54:05.574 --> 54:09.745
I got the answer I needed. He's
just a, he's just a douche.

54:48.284 --> 54:50.153
So, hey,
what's your problem, kid?

55:01.331 --> 55:02.699
That supposed to be me?

55:05.067 --> 55:06.302
It's your soul.

55:12.240 --> 55:14.275
I mean,
it was really small.

55:14.277 --> 55:16.577
Yeah, accurate.

55:16.579 --> 55:18.315
That's not nice.

55:19.782 --> 55:22.816
What? He's angry.
And he has every right to be.

55:22.818 --> 55:24.485
I don't blame him,
I guess, little shit.

55:24.487 --> 55:26.021
Come on, one more,
for old time's sake.

55:30.259 --> 55:31.427
You...

55:31.927 --> 55:33.028
Mmm...

55:34.262 --> 55:35.729
You know,
I'm real happy to see you

55:35.731 --> 55:37.563
and your old man
get along so well.

55:37.565 --> 55:38.999
Yeah.

55:39.001 --> 55:43.269
I'm working on letting it go.

55:43.271 --> 55:46.139
- In with the good, out with the bad.
- Right.

55:46.141 --> 55:49.275
Yeah, so he wasn't there ever.

55:49.277 --> 55:51.711
- Who needs someone around all the time?
- Right.

55:51.713 --> 55:53.981
So he...
He never drove carpool.

55:53.983 --> 55:58.885
So he bought my first car with the
money he got beating a Belgian casino.

55:58.887 --> 56:02.222
- That's pretty cool, isn't it?
- You're a wise woman.

56:02.224 --> 56:05.392
I'm not trying
to change anyone, you know?

56:05.394 --> 56:08.862
An elephant will always
be an elephant.

56:08.864 --> 56:10.563
- He will never be a monkey.
- A monkey.

56:10.565 --> 56:12.331
Yes, I learned that from you.

56:22.010 --> 56:23.246
You look lonely.

56:29.451 --> 56:31.420
Yeah, I am.

56:49.838 --> 56:51.206
<i>Hey, Kirkie.</i>

56:52.373 --> 56:54.777
<i>I thought you could use
some more product.</i>

56:56.012 --> 56:57.744
<i>Uh, no, no,
I'm leaving the business.</i>

56:57.746 --> 57:01.548
<i>Looking for something
more family-oriented.</i>

57:01.550 --> 57:06.420
<i>Marijuana's about to be legal
anyway, so it's lost its fun.</i>

57:06.422 --> 57:09.889
Just want to get
rid of it, that's all.

57:09.891 --> 57:12.461
No, no, no, everything,
everything's fine. Well...

57:14.130 --> 57:17.599
Oh, just want to give you
the best deal of your life.

57:53.068 --> 57:54.269
What are you doing?

57:55.304 --> 57:58.072
Oh, nothing, nothing.

57:58.074 --> 57:59.943
Go to sleep. Go back to sleep.

58:30.505 --> 58:31.807
I miss this.

58:33.574 --> 58:35.377
Like waking up
in a jigsaw puzzle.

58:37.280 --> 58:39.015
I can't move my leg.

58:41.282 --> 58:42.916
Well, I wouldn't...

58:42.918 --> 58:44.952
Yeah, I wouldn't.

58:44.954 --> 58:47.156
That brown one
looks like he's comfortable.

58:50.425 --> 58:51.691
You save all these guys?

58:51.693 --> 58:53.126
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

58:53.128 --> 58:56.729
- Mm-hmm.
- Some things never change, huh?

58:56.731 --> 58:58.934
You're gonna save me
one of these days.

59:15.818 --> 59:17.684
Do you have any spare cash?

59:17.686 --> 59:20.022
I need to send Henry
to a special school.

59:22.056 --> 59:23.590
What's wrong with him?

59:23.592 --> 59:26.526
He's gay, or socially awkward,
or brilliant.

59:26.528 --> 59:27.764
Maybe all three.

59:29.898 --> 59:31.833
Things are kind of tight
around here.

59:33.568 --> 59:35.735
Wait, what about Sofia?
You still working for her?

59:35.737 --> 59:38.539
- Can't you ask her?
- No, I did.

59:38.541 --> 59:41.842
Working for her is really
complicating our friendship.

59:41.844 --> 59:44.679
What friendship? She always
treated you like shit.

59:44.681 --> 59:46.249
She isn't all that bad.

59:48.550 --> 59:51.086
I just wish I didn't have to
go back and work for her.

59:52.320 --> 59:54.023
Well, we all
gotta work, honey.

59:58.393 --> 59:59.596
What do you do?

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:02.262
- What do I do?
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:02.264 --> 01:00:05.999
I do a little of this.

01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:07.503
A little of this.

01:00:08.704 --> 01:00:10.036
A lot of this.

01:00:10.038 --> 01:00:12.909
Leonard. Leonard.
Leonard, come on. I'm serious.

01:00:13.442 --> 01:00:15.041
I'm serious.

01:00:15.043 --> 01:00:18.181
- Okay? Our kid needs help.
- Well, we all need help, honey.

01:00:19.748 --> 01:00:21.451
Look, in fact...

01:00:23.219 --> 01:00:26.320
I was kind of hoping that I might be
able to borrow some cash from you.

01:00:26.322 --> 01:00:28.255
- I'm thinking of going to Venezuela.
- Okay.

01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:30.222
- And then...
- Do you care about Henry at all?

01:00:30.224 --> 01:00:33.860
Well, sure I do,
but you know me. I...

01:00:33.862 --> 01:00:35.028
I'm not good
at that kind of stuff.

01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:36.597
You're not good at what stuff?

01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:40.066
Loving your son? Taking care of him?
Being responsible?

01:00:40.068 --> 01:00:43.068
Yeah. Yeah, but you know what?
You're good at that,

01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:44.470
and so the good news is,
you know,

01:00:44.472 --> 01:00:45.942
we balance each other out.

01:00:50.278 --> 01:00:53.046
- Fuck.
- What? What?

01:00:53.048 --> 01:00:55.481
- I'm so fucked up.
- No, no, no. Come on.

01:00:55.483 --> 01:00:57.383
No, honey, come on.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:00:57.385 --> 01:00:58.719
- No, no. Come on.
- No.

01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:00.854
- Stay here. Come on.
- No. Ew, ew.

01:01:00.856 --> 01:01:03.289
- Stay here.
- I'm so fucked up!

01:01:03.291 --> 01:01:05.258
I can't even
tell my therapist everything.

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.026
That's how fucked up I am.

01:01:07.028 --> 01:01:10.166
So fucked up.
You know what?

01:01:11.532 --> 01:01:13.200
I think you might be
my father.

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:15.269
You even wear
the same deodorant.

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:17.137
Right, well, you know what?

01:01:17.139 --> 01:01:20.273
I'm not your father.
Your father's me.

01:01:20.275 --> 01:01:22.809
Oh, God.

01:01:22.811 --> 01:01:25.646
I was messed up when I met
you, and 18 years later,

01:01:25.648 --> 01:01:26.713
I still
haven't learned anything.

01:01:26.715 --> 01:01:28.315
I am literally
going backwards.

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:30.483
You know, you don't give
yourself enough credit, Laura.

01:01:30.485 --> 01:01:32.586
You're smarter than you think.
You do a lot of smart shit.

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:34.320
Like what?

01:01:34.322 --> 01:01:36.958
Like divorcing me. That's big.

01:01:37.592 --> 01:01:39.159
You know what?

01:01:39.161 --> 01:01:42.095
You know, a lot of women, they
get all wrapped up in all this,

01:01:42.097 --> 01:01:44.699
but you bailed
at exactly the right time.

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:46.465
I mean, it wasn't gonna get
any better.

01:01:46.467 --> 01:01:48.802
- It wasn't?
- Mm, it wasn't.

01:01:48.804 --> 01:01:51.604
I mean, all them promises,
they were bullshit, you know?

01:01:51.606 --> 01:01:53.507
I wasn't gonna change,
and I still aren't.

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:56.443
- So what are you saying?
- I'm saying exactly what I'm saying.

01:01:56.445 --> 01:01:58.012
- You are, aren't you?
- Yeah.

01:01:58.014 --> 01:02:00.016
I mean, I tell Misty
that all the time.

01:02:00.882 --> 01:02:03.749
Please tell me Misty
is your cat.

01:02:03.751 --> 01:02:05.485
You want me to tell you
Misty's my cat?

01:02:05.487 --> 01:02:07.686
- Who is she?
- My cat.

01:02:07.688 --> 01:02:09.588
- She's your wife, isn't she?
- She is.

01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:12.258
- Jesus! Fuck!
- Come on, I didn't tell you

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.392
'cause I knew
you'd freak out like this.

01:02:13.394 --> 01:02:14.728
Okay, you know what? Okay.

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:17.030
So, what, and you tricked me
into sleeping with you?

01:02:17.032 --> 01:02:18.264
Well, I didn't have
to do much.

01:02:18.266 --> 01:02:20.833
You know what?
You are a lousy father,

01:02:20.835 --> 01:02:23.737
and you're a lousy ex,
and we both deserve better.

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:26.940
Good for you! Hey, Laura!
Good for you, honey!

01:02:26.942 --> 01:02:28.811
You're a lot tougher
than you think.

01:02:36.318 --> 01:02:37.519
Hey, Laura?

01:02:39.987 --> 01:02:41.223
Laura?

01:02:43.492 --> 01:02:44.527
Hey.

01:02:47.929 --> 01:02:50.599
He's married, and I still
want to be with him.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:54.369
It's disgusting.
He might as well be you.

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:01.941
I chose the worst possible
father for my son,

01:03:01.943 --> 01:03:04.543
the worst possible man for me.

01:03:04.545 --> 01:03:07.380
Eighty percent of the time,
I feel like total shit.

01:03:07.382 --> 01:03:11.620
Well, 20% is a pretty good
amount of time to feel decent.

01:03:13.155 --> 01:03:17.758
Just tell me it's gonna be okay.
Can you tell me that?

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:23.664
I don't know what it's going to
be like, but I might have a plan.

01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:26.398
It's knee-jerk,
but it might work.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.635
What should I do?

01:03:28.637 --> 01:03:31.237
Well, just keep doing
what you're doing,

01:03:31.239 --> 01:03:34.173
but, uh, don't take
any more bullshit.

01:03:34.175 --> 01:03:36.008
- You mean no more dogs?
- No.

01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:41.183
I mean no more lying
sons of bitches like Leonard.

01:03:44.719 --> 01:03:46.788
Hoight, get your things.
We're leaving.

01:03:49.391 --> 01:03:50.593
Come here, Leonard.

01:03:51.793 --> 01:03:53.959
What...
What's the matter, Jack?

01:03:53.961 --> 01:03:58.164
Now, I'm not the type of man who throws a
sucker punch, so this is your warning.

01:03:58.166 --> 01:03:59.335
I'm going to hit you now.

01:04:01.735 --> 01:04:04.938
Now, you listen good, 'cause I'm
only going to say this once.

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:08.807
You stay away from my daughter
and my grandson. You hear me?

01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:13.313
If you mess with them one more time,
I'll make sure it's your last.

01:04:13.315 --> 01:04:16.349
Jesus Christ, Jack.
I thought you were a Buddhist.

01:04:16.351 --> 01:04:17.950
Oh, I am.

01:04:17.952 --> 01:04:21.423
But you bring out the
right-wing Christian in me.

01:04:26.061 --> 01:04:27.063
Hey!

01:04:28.364 --> 01:04:29.662
Hey.

01:04:29.664 --> 01:04:32.567
You, you really think
I give a shit?

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:35.635
Your whole family's crazy.

01:04:35.637 --> 01:04:38.371
I mean, whoever heard
of a family drug deal, anyway?

01:04:38.373 --> 01:04:40.175
How much pot you have
back there, Jack?

01:04:42.844 --> 01:04:44.045
Oh, you mean you don't know?

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:46.445
Well...

01:04:46.447 --> 01:04:49.317
Well, look in the trunk, sweetheart.
You're a drug mule.

01:04:50.985 --> 01:04:53.519
At least I never dragged her
into any of my scores, Jack.

01:04:53.521 --> 01:04:55.688
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing.

01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:58.025
Open the trunk.

01:04:58.027 --> 01:05:01.061
- Do you promise not to be mad?
- Open it.

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:02.996
Yeah, there's nothing
in there, Henry.

01:05:02.998 --> 01:05:05.298
He's just trying to stir up trouble.
That's all.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.400
Don't open it.

01:05:07.402 --> 01:05:09.536
- Don't you trust us, Mom?
- Open the trunk!

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:10.806
Yeah, come on.

01:05:16.378 --> 01:05:18.713
I couldn't let you
throw out good product.

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:36.695
Is she dying?

01:05:36.697 --> 01:05:40.099
No, she's not dying. Let me
work on her for a second.

01:05:50.278 --> 01:05:52.612
- Don't.
- Look,

01:05:52.614 --> 01:05:58.117
I know how much you must
hate me right now, but,

01:05:58.119 --> 01:06:02.054
but I don't think you're capable
of turning your father in.

01:06:02.056 --> 01:06:03.423
You don't know me at all.

01:06:03.425 --> 01:06:05.458
I do, and I don't think
you would do that.

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:09.896
I am a mother. I could be arrested.
Uh, Henry could be arrested.

01:06:09.898 --> 01:06:11.363
No one
is going to be arrested.

01:06:11.365 --> 01:06:13.298
You... You don't know that.
We don't all have your luck.

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:17.003
I was trying to help the kid.
You told me you needed help.

01:06:17.005 --> 01:06:20.740
And this was your solution?
Trafficking drugs across the country?

01:06:20.742 --> 01:06:23.142
You know what?
I don't know why I bother.

01:06:23.144 --> 01:06:26.412
I mean, you just...
You just can't...

01:06:26.414 --> 01:06:29.782
You can't live without being
a victim, can you? Huh?

01:06:29.784 --> 01:06:33.086
You'd rather suffer
than see the good in a situation.

01:06:33.088 --> 01:06:35.421
Well, I nearly got enough
for Henry's education.

01:06:35.423 --> 01:06:38.590
I'm not paying for Henry's
school with drug money!

01:06:38.592 --> 01:06:40.661
Oh, yeah, punish the kid.
That's smart.

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:43.463
Oh, don't you dare turn
this around on me. I am mad!

01:06:43.465 --> 01:06:46.800
I'm the one that's mad.
You disappointed me. Again!

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:50.003
Again? I didn't know you were counting.
How many times is it?

01:06:50.005 --> 01:06:53.505
My entire childhood. One
disappointment after the next.

01:06:53.507 --> 01:06:56.342
You never came through. Dad, you
never came through. Not once.

01:06:56.344 --> 01:06:57.811
Well, you're living,
you're breathing.

01:06:57.813 --> 01:06:59.479
I sure as hell
didn't kill you.

01:06:59.481 --> 01:07:02.449
Oh, thank you so much for supplying
the basics, Dad. Thank you.

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:04.851
The food and the water
were brilliant.

01:07:04.853 --> 01:07:08.588
- Thank you!
- Now you're being dramatic.

01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:11.394
You... You don't have a clue,
do you?

01:07:16.831 --> 01:07:21.069
How much time I spent
waiting for you to show up.

01:07:22.737 --> 01:07:24.704
Disappearing for weeks on end,

01:07:24.706 --> 01:07:28.041
never being reachable when I
was getting my heart broken.

01:07:28.043 --> 01:07:31.979
Leaving me alone to take care of
Jojo in that shitty apartment.

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:35.048
I spent
my entire childhood scared.

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:37.585
Why weren't you there?
I needed you, Dad.

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:47.026
Did you hear what I said?
I said I needed you.

01:07:55.804 --> 01:07:57.773
I'm sorry you were scared.

01:08:08.983 --> 01:08:11.517
Please tell me
that you are dying.

01:08:11.519 --> 01:08:13.420
You didn't lie about that,
did you?

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:16.225
At least, please, please,
tell me that that's true.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:20.496
We're all dying, really.

01:08:23.564 --> 01:08:25.934
I'm done. I'm done.

01:08:26.568 --> 01:08:29.568
I am so done!

01:08:29.569 --> 01:08:31.638
You can drive your own drugs
around from now on.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.772
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:34.140
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- You know what?

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:36.910
And find your own ride to L.A.
because we are done.

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.211
You're really acting crazy.

01:08:38.212 --> 01:08:39.545
It's you that's going to
get us arrested.

01:08:39.546 --> 01:08:41.313
You know,
and you are selfish.

01:08:41.314 --> 01:08:44.550
You are absolutely incapable of
putting anyone else before yourself.

01:08:44.551 --> 01:08:46.620
Maybe you could be happier
if you did the same.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.921
I mean, you wouldn't be so
goddamn miserable all the time.

01:08:48.923 --> 01:08:50.089
- Grandpa.
- No.

01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:51.390
Stay out of this, Hoight.

01:08:51.393 --> 01:08:53.093
Your mother has lost
all rational thought.

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:54.560
Don't tell me how to feel.

01:08:54.563 --> 01:08:56.729
You don't get to tell me
anything anymore.

01:08:56.731 --> 01:09:00.299
I am angry, and I'm not burying
any more shit for your sake.

01:09:00.301 --> 01:09:03.236
- Mom. Mom.
- Henry, it's fine!

01:09:03.238 --> 01:09:04.673
There's a cop coming.

01:09:06.108 --> 01:09:08.206
Jesus Christ.

01:09:09.277 --> 01:09:10.410
Pick up the weed!

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:12.144
- All right.
- Pick it up!

01:09:12.145 --> 01:09:13.379
- All right, now, stay cool.
- Pick up all the weed!

01:09:13.381 --> 01:09:14.714
- Pick it up.
- Stay cool.

01:09:14.716 --> 01:09:16.249
- Jesus. Hurry.
- Don't go wild on me.

01:09:16.251 --> 01:09:17.718
- Move slow.
- Henry, put it in.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.051
- Put it in the truck. Henry!
- Move slow.

01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:20.586
Just... Okay, Dad,
get in the car.

01:09:20.587 --> 01:09:21.653
That's too slow.

01:09:21.654 --> 01:09:23.189
Get in the car!

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:24.456
All right, all right. Okay.

01:09:24.457 --> 01:09:25.627
Close the trunk!

01:09:30.997 --> 01:09:33.265
- Stuff this down your pants.
- I don't have any room.

01:09:33.268 --> 01:09:35.069
- Stop throwing it around.
- Hey. This, too.

01:09:37.305 --> 01:09:40.140
Smells like a Grateful
Dead concert in here.

01:09:41.774 --> 01:09:42.743
Hello.

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:45.944
License and registration.

01:09:45.947 --> 01:09:47.048
Sure.

01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:51.450
Is there anything
wrong, Officer?

01:09:51.452 --> 01:09:54.754
You want to tell me what you
were doing outside your vehicle?

01:09:54.756 --> 01:09:56.522
Oh, right, the diapers.

01:09:56.524 --> 01:09:58.357
My father's diapers
flew out the window,

01:09:58.359 --> 01:10:00.061
and we pulled over
to pick it up.

01:10:04.032 --> 01:10:05.499
He has cancer.

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:07.536
My father has cancer.
Very bad cancer.

01:10:09.203 --> 01:10:12.438
- All these animals belong to you?
- Yes.

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:14.874
Is that your son
in the back, laughing?

01:10:14.876 --> 01:10:16.878
That is my son,
but I believe he's crying.

01:10:27.555 --> 01:10:29.423
- Shit.
- This is the number of my lawyer.

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:31.491
Shit, shit!

01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:33.593
- Let him know where they send me.
- I'll go with you.

01:10:33.595 --> 01:10:36.094
- No. No, no, no, no.
- I'm your partner.

01:10:36.096 --> 01:10:38.330
You shut your mouth.
You knew nothing.

01:10:38.332 --> 01:10:40.066
If you stick to that story,
you'll be fine.

01:10:40.068 --> 01:10:41.201
What about me?

01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:42.669
- Laura Jaconi?
- Yes.

01:10:42.671 --> 01:10:44.271
Please, step out
of the vehicle.

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:45.705
Is there something
wrong, Officer?

01:10:45.707 --> 01:10:47.475
Please step out
of the vehicle.

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:56.883
Uh, uh-uh, hold on, hold on.

01:10:56.885 --> 01:11:00.922
Uh, before you take her in,
let me explain.

01:11:01.756 --> 01:11:03.356
Uh...

01:11:03.358 --> 01:11:05.424
This is all
a misunderstanding.

01:11:05.426 --> 01:11:06.726
Really?

01:11:06.728 --> 01:11:10.265
You can explain
her unpaid parking tickets?

01:11:13.201 --> 01:11:14.767
Parking tickets?

01:11:14.769 --> 01:11:16.538
Over $3,000 worth.

01:11:19.173 --> 01:11:22.744
Well, that can't be explained.
She's a criminal. Lock her up.

01:11:26.713 --> 01:11:29.451
Ah-ha.
There she is. The law breaker.

01:11:33.454 --> 01:11:35.921
I'm enjoying this, Laura.

01:11:35.923 --> 01:11:40.259
Uh, how is Sausalito
going to go to sleep at night

01:11:40.261 --> 01:11:43.429
knowing that a cold-blooded
criminal, such as yourself,

01:11:43.431 --> 01:11:44.930
is back on the streets?

01:11:44.932 --> 01:11:46.232
So I got behind a few tickets.

01:11:46.234 --> 01:11:47.733
- So what?
- Behind?

01:11:47.735 --> 01:11:50.269
You haven't paid one
since 1983.

01:11:50.271 --> 01:11:52.504
What did you suppose
was going to happen?

01:11:52.506 --> 01:11:54.808
Stop it, Dad.
I'm not in the mood.

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:57.108
Look...

01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:58.413
Tell me the truth.

01:11:59.881 --> 01:12:01.414
Did you get a rush?

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:03.916
<i>♪♪ I can live</i>

01:12:03.918 --> 01:12:05.918
<i>♪♪ I can smile</i>

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:09.955

<i>♪♪ All ♪♪</i>

01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:43.956
This is the last stop, Dad.
Get rid of it.

01:12:43.958 --> 01:12:45.857
Oh, I plan to.

01:12:45.859 --> 01:12:48.693
And my best customer will be getting
the deal of his life, thanks to you.

01:12:48.695 --> 01:12:50.696
Okay, if you're trying
to make me feel guilty

01:12:50.698 --> 01:12:53.366
for keeping my son out of
juvie, it's not working.

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:55.535
How many diapers do you need?

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:59.875
Uh, I'll get 'em. I'm going
to do this one alone.

01:13:04.145 --> 01:13:06.715
Keep an eye on your mother
for me, will you?

01:13:10.118 --> 01:13:12.451
You're being a real
C-U-Next-Tuesday.

01:13:12.453 --> 01:13:14.690
He's never gonna
want to live with us now.

01:13:17.458 --> 01:13:20.460
He was never gonna
live with us, Henry.

01:13:24.131 --> 01:13:26.067
Shit.

01:13:28.002 --> 01:13:29.471
I gotta take this.

01:13:32.372 --> 01:13:34.742
Hi. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:13:35.342 --> 01:13:36.541
Okay.

01:13:36.543 --> 01:13:39.211
One thing at a time, Sofia.

01:13:39.213 --> 01:13:42.113
Jack, it's so good
to see you, my friend.

01:13:42.115 --> 01:13:44.550
Oh, my goodness.

01:13:44.552 --> 01:13:46.788
- Come on in. Come on in.
- You bet.

01:13:49.256 --> 01:13:53.393
You know, I'll open a bottle
of Macallan 25.

01:13:53.395 --> 01:13:54.593
Oh, boy.

01:13:54.595 --> 01:13:56.595
I've been saving it
for somebody worthy.

01:13:56.597 --> 01:13:58.798
Well, you better put it
in a to-go cup.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.599
My daughter
is pouting in the car.

01:14:01.601 --> 01:14:03.335
Why, she doesn't want
to come in?

01:14:03.337 --> 01:14:06.005
She's taking some kind
of stand.

01:14:06.007 --> 01:14:08.441
I don't know what I've done.

01:14:08.443 --> 01:14:10.543
I probably tried
to help her, I guess.

01:14:10.545 --> 01:14:14.679
Well, my... My daughter Jennie
hasn't spoken to me

01:14:14.681 --> 01:14:17.916
since I forgot to thank her
at the Globes in '93.

01:14:17.918 --> 01:14:20.952
She was nine, Jack. Holy moly.

01:14:20.954 --> 01:14:23.792
- Well, straight to business, then.
- To business. Yeah, you bet.

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:28.394
And here is the moolah.

01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:33.034
- How you doing, Jack?
- I don't know.

01:14:33.868 --> 01:14:35.601
Maybe it's time to retire.

01:14:35.603 --> 01:14:39.604
Nope, word's not allowed in the house.
Especially about Jack Jaconi.

01:14:39.606 --> 01:14:41.473
Well, I've been thinking
about it.

01:14:41.475 --> 01:14:43.778
Spending some time
with my family.

01:14:46.847 --> 01:14:48.748
They're awful,
but they can't help it.

01:14:51.685 --> 01:14:55.655
Her party won't be a
disaster, Sofia. I promise.

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:58.491
I...

01:14:58.493 --> 01:15:01.994
Please calm down, please. Look,
I'm asking you as a friend.

01:15:01.996 --> 01:15:03.495
I mean, give me
the benefit of the doubt.

01:15:03.497 --> 01:15:04.863
Just give me a few days
to figure it out.

01:15:04.865 --> 01:15:07.133
True's party's gonna be perfect.
I promise.

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:08.500
No.

01:15:08.502 --> 01:15:10.969
I know. Well,
I'm sorry I let you down.

01:15:10.971 --> 01:15:15.007
I... No, I don't expect you
to loan me the money for it.

01:15:15.009 --> 01:15:16.576
I... I... I know.

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:22.248
Do you
want them to call the cops?

01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:24.019
Turn the fucking music down.

01:15:28.823 --> 01:15:31.894
Hey, if anything goes wrong,
start shooting.

01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:34.563
Hurry up.

01:15:38.699 --> 01:15:42.035
- Do you think they're after Grandpa?
- I don't know.

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:45.073
- Should we call the cops?
- No, we can't call the cops.

01:15:46.306 --> 01:15:47.639
What if they kill him?

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:54.750
Oh.

01:15:56.417 --> 01:15:58.519
I've been meaning
to tell this to you.

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:05.093
I think that you
are a decent guy.

01:16:07.662 --> 01:16:10.164
I think you have a good heart.

01:16:12.399 --> 01:16:15.937
Sometimes bad guys
need to hear that.

01:16:29.684 --> 01:16:31.019
- The masseuse.
- Huh?

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.254
The masseuse.

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:39.459
Sure you don't want to stay? She'll
rub everything but your cock.

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:44.632
Since when does Joey Carlisle
need to pay a woman to touch him?

01:16:46.201 --> 01:16:48.134
Since my pubes turned white.

01:16:50.371 --> 01:16:51.472
Okay.

01:16:54.708 --> 01:16:57.375
Surprise,
motherfucker. Hands up.

01:16:57.377 --> 01:16:59.581
Turn around. Turn around.
Hands up.

01:17:00.648 --> 01:17:02.415
Hurry the fuck up.

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:07.754
Hands up! Hands up!

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:09.088
Jesus Christ.

01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:11.523
Go! Against the wall. Go.

Where's the money?

01:17:16.797 --> 01:17:19.432
- Where's the money?
- I don't know. I'm stoned.

01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:20.836

01:17:29.377 --> 01:17:31.943
Okay, take off your clothes.

01:17:31.945 --> 01:17:33.979
- What?
- You heard me.

01:17:33.981 --> 01:17:36.883
Take off your shirts.
At least take off your shirts.

01:17:36.885 --> 01:17:38.750
Why do they have to
take their shirts off?

01:17:38.752 --> 01:17:41.187
They could have guns
under their shirts, you idiot.

01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:43.755
- We don't. Don't worry.
- Turn around!

01:17:43.757 --> 01:17:45.357
Tell them again.

01:17:45.359 --> 01:17:47.527
Just stay still. Shit!

01:17:50.465 --> 01:17:51.632
I said hold still!

01:17:53.634 --> 01:17:57.268
Oh, Cooper.

01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:58.407
No.

01:17:59.006 --> 01:18:00.639
Yep.

01:18:00.641 --> 01:18:03.643
It says "Cooper's a badass"
right there on your shoe.

01:18:03.645 --> 01:18:05.010
I'm not Cooper!

01:18:05.012 --> 01:18:06.278
I told you not to wear those!

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.046
I didn't know
his eyesight was so good.

01:18:08.048 --> 01:18:09.949
Only my grandson
would be dumb enough

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:12.617
to think he could
pull a stunt like this off.

01:18:12.619 --> 01:18:14.387
- It's not... I'm...
- Your grandson?

01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:18.057
Yes. Yes, my grandson.

01:18:18.059 --> 01:18:20.226
Just... Okay, everybody
just shut the fuck up!

01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:22.460
- And this is his friend?
- I'm afraid so.

01:18:22.462 --> 01:18:24.164
- I didn't know.
- I didn't wear the shoes!

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:25.798
- This was your idea!
- What the hell's going on?

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.468
Robbed by some
prepubescent booger eaters?

01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:31.036
Why'd you have to ruin it,
Grandpa, huh?

01:18:31.038 --> 01:18:33.039
Why do you always
gotta ruin shit?

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:35.040
Why didn't you just let us have the money?
It's not like...

01:18:35.042 --> 01:18:37.076
Don't hurt my father,
motherfucker!

01:18:37.078 --> 01:18:38.513
Holy fucking shit!

01:18:39.814 --> 01:18:43.014
- Oh.
- God damn it.

01:18:43.016 --> 01:18:45.153
Little shits left us here
to die.

01:18:48.722 --> 01:18:50.723
What just happened?

01:18:50.725 --> 01:18:53.195
Honey, you saved our lives.

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:55.193
Yeah.

01:18:55.195 --> 01:18:58.363
I mean, how can, uh...

01:18:58.365 --> 01:18:59.865
How can we repay you?

01:18:59.867 --> 01:19:02.901
Oh, my God,
I'm just glad I was here.

01:19:02.903 --> 01:19:05.237
I mean, that was amazing.
Did you see them run?

01:19:05.239 --> 01:19:07.874
Yeah, they ran out
like two scared kids.

01:19:07.876 --> 01:19:10.142
You think, you think
they're coming back?

01:19:10.144 --> 01:19:11.910
I think we'd better
get out of here,

01:19:11.912 --> 01:19:14.680
'cause I'm pretty sure
they were cartel.

01:19:14.682 --> 01:19:16.715
- Oh, cartel, yeah.
- Cartel cartel?

01:19:16.717 --> 01:19:18.584
- Yeah. Cartel, yeah.
- And they were afraid of me?

01:19:18.586 --> 01:19:23.054
Well, you came in here like a freaking
maniac with that bow and arrow.

01:19:23.056 --> 01:19:24.757
Even I was scared of you.

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:29.061
Oh, no. No. Please.

01:19:31.097 --> 01:19:32.998
Hang on a minute.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.804
Yeah, Sofia, this,
this isn't really a good time.

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:37.539
Yeah.

01:19:38.405 --> 01:19:39.608
Yeah.

01:19:42.543 --> 01:19:45.044
You know what?

01:19:45.046 --> 01:19:47.580
There isn't gonna be
a white tiger, okay?

01:19:47.582 --> 01:19:49.482
Yeah, I didn't book it.

01:19:49.484 --> 01:19:52.384
You know why?
Because they are extinct,

01:19:52.386 --> 01:19:54.620
and the few left in this world
don't want to spend the day

01:19:54.622 --> 01:19:56.054
with you and your
freaking spoiled daughter,

01:19:56.056 --> 01:19:58.723
so figure that shit out
on your own, okay?

01:19:58.725 --> 01:20:00.994
And you know what else?

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:02.928
We're not friends.
No, we're not.

01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:05.397
We... We haven't been friends since
you made me return your stripper gear

01:20:05.399 --> 01:20:08.067
to every Buffalo Exchange
in Seattle, so...

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:09.871
Fuck off, former friend!

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:38.124
Hello!

01:21:41.895 --> 01:21:43.695
Dad.

01:21:43.697 --> 01:21:45.397
How was the drive?

01:21:45.399 --> 01:21:48.334
Well, your sister scared away some
cartel members and saved my life.

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:49.500
Whoa.

01:21:49.502 --> 01:21:51.305
Way to go, Laura-san.

01:21:52.873 --> 01:21:55.542
Guess how much I paid
for this painting.

01:21:58.212 --> 01:22:01.347
You're right. It was free.

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:04.715
My friends found it
in the dog park in a dumpster,

01:22:04.717 --> 01:22:07.687
and they were like,
"Jojo will want this."

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:09.588
And then they
presented it to me,

01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:12.791
and I was like,
"Heck, yeah, I do."

01:22:12.793 --> 01:22:15.027
Who wouldn't want a totally
touching oil painting

01:22:15.029 --> 01:22:18.062
of a mother dog helping
her pup cross a stream?

01:22:18.064 --> 01:22:19.333
A lot of people.

01:22:20.367 --> 01:22:22.404
Well, whoever
threw it away, yeah.

01:22:23.103 --> 01:22:24.970
Well...

01:22:24.972 --> 01:22:27.240
This is not
the Waldorf Astoria.

01:22:27.242 --> 01:22:29.540
Okay, Dad,
let me give you a tour

01:22:29.542 --> 01:22:32.076
before you judge
your new home. Hmm?

01:22:32.078 --> 01:22:34.213
- Yeah.
- Okay, so... Excuse me.

01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:41.553
Over here, this is where I do
my Pilates about once a week.

01:22:41.555 --> 01:22:44.790
And this is where
I have my coffee. Delish.

01:22:44.792 --> 01:22:48.326
Oh, this is my amazing roommate,
Fritz, who also sells marijuana,

01:22:48.328 --> 01:22:50.428
so the two of you
will have a lot to chat about.

01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:52.130
- Papa-san.
- No.

01:22:52.132 --> 01:22:56.302
And this is what has now
become the family bed.

01:22:56.304 --> 01:22:58.736
Who would have thought
the four of us,

01:22:58.738 --> 01:23:01.807
with four dogs,
together in a family bed?

01:23:01.809 --> 01:23:03.375
Does it get any better?

01:23:03.377 --> 01:23:05.378
- I sure hope so.
- Dad, come on.

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.981
You're about to take up half
of her 400 square feet.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:09.882
She's trying to look
on the bright side.

01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:11.786
Well, I'm not seeing it.

01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:18.025
Laura, I think I might know
what would cheer Dad up.

01:23:18.993 --> 01:23:22.961
- No.
- Yes, and yes, and yes.

01:23:22.963 --> 01:23:25.300
- No.
- And yes.

01:23:29.069 --> 01:23:30.538
Okay, okay, okay.

01:23:31.939 --> 01:23:33.438
All right, Dad.

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:35.641
Remember that night
you lost $60,000

01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:38.510
on a bad Super Bowl bet
and we did a performance

01:23:38.512 --> 01:23:40.345
to take away
the sting a little?

01:23:40.347 --> 01:23:42.080
- It didn't.
- Well, even though back then

01:23:42.082 --> 01:23:43.749
it was appropriate
to perform the dance

01:23:43.751 --> 01:23:46.117
- in our underwear...
- It wasn't.

01:23:46.119 --> 01:23:48.288
Well, tonight,
we are fully clothed.

01:23:48.855 --> 01:23:50.188
Ready, Fritz?

01:23:50.190 --> 01:23:52.159
Ready? Lights.

Well, that was underwhelming.

01:25:10.771 --> 01:25:12.871
Dad, what does it take
to impress you?

01:25:12.873 --> 01:25:17.043
I mean, do I have to save
a life or cure cancer?

01:25:17.045 --> 01:25:18.910
You want me to stop
a live rape?

01:25:18.912 --> 01:25:20.278
Yeah, that would impress me.

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.380
Well, I'm not a superhero,
Dad, okay?

01:25:22.382 --> 01:25:24.950
I'm just a regular
35-year-old woman.

01:25:24.952 --> 01:25:26.621
I'm going to my room.

01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:28.589
Excuse me.

01:25:43.404 --> 01:25:45.240
Can we get something to eat?

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:52.410
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

01:25:52.412 --> 01:25:53.745
Doesn't feel like nothing.

01:25:53.747 --> 01:25:55.946
Well, you

01:25:55.948 --> 01:26:00.184
drive me across the entire
country just to get rid of me.

01:26:00.186 --> 01:26:03.254
Is that what you think?
We're getting rid of you?

01:26:03.256 --> 01:26:06.525
Well, you might as well check
me back into another home.

01:26:06.527 --> 01:26:08.563
You wanted to be there.
You chose that place.

01:26:09.596 --> 01:26:10.995
It was my only option.

01:26:10.997 --> 01:26:12.831
- It wasn't your only option.
- I'm hungry.

01:26:12.833 --> 01:26:15.267
You could have made the tiniest effort.
You could have stayed with us.

01:26:15.269 --> 01:26:16.835
You could have given me
one tiny rule.

01:26:16.837 --> 01:26:18.771
That's literally the only thing
I can do to protect myself.

01:26:18.773 --> 01:26:20.772
- From what? From whom?
- I'm really hungry.

01:26:20.774 --> 01:26:23.275
- From you.
- Oh, so now I'm a serial killer?

01:26:23.277 --> 01:26:24.977
No, you're just the one
who can hurt me the most.

01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:26.648
I'm really fucking hungry!

01:26:29.016 --> 01:26:31.985
Seriously, guys,
figure it out already.

01:26:35.021 --> 01:26:36.390
I need to eat.

01:26:56.909 --> 01:26:58.876
- Ready to order?
- Oh.

01:26:58.878 --> 01:27:01.748
Yeah, we'll have one
of everything.

01:27:02.548 --> 01:27:04.049
Everything?

01:27:04.051 --> 01:27:07.222
Yeah, one order
of every dish on the menu.

01:27:08.555 --> 01:27:10.225
The kid needs to eat.

01:27:13.726 --> 01:27:16.197
One order, mixed vegetables!

01:27:19.832 --> 01:27:24.371
"When troubles come, they come not
single spies, but in battalions."

01:27:25.204 --> 01:27:26.841
Oh, my gosh.

01:27:28.676 --> 01:27:30.009
Don't get too excited.

01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:31.977
What a lazy Susan
this one is.

01:27:33.547 --> 01:27:36.147
Was there lobster on the menu?

01:28:19.659 --> 01:28:21.028
He's gone.

01:28:22.896 --> 01:28:24.097
I know.

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.710
He took the car.

01:28:36.443 --> 01:28:37.779
He left you this.

01:28:43.015 --> 01:28:44.817
Oh...

01:28:44.819 --> 01:28:48.489
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Sister-san, come here. Come on.

01:28:49.856 --> 01:28:53.458
Don't, don't, don't cry.

01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:56.361
I always knew
he wasn't gonna stay.

01:28:56.363 --> 01:28:59.830
I just thought
I'd get to see you and Henry.

01:28:59.832 --> 01:29:03.134
This would be so much easier
if he was an asshole.

01:29:03.136 --> 01:29:05.038
Oh, you know what? He is.

01:29:08.108 --> 01:29:11.143
Feels just as shitty
as when we were kids.

01:29:11.145 --> 01:29:14.079
Well, think of how it feels
for him.

01:29:14.081 --> 01:29:17.249
Here he has two great kids,

01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:22.321
super successful, amazing,
brilliant dancers.

01:29:22.323 --> 01:29:26.461
And yet he chooses to spend
time with other people's kids.

01:29:27.994 --> 01:29:31.332
- Who are other people's kids?
- Everybody else.

01:29:37.671 --> 01:29:41.743
- What'd he give you?
- $20,000 worth of marijuana.

01:29:42.475 --> 01:29:44.177
And Blind Poodle.

01:29:48.882 --> 01:29:50.251
How about you?

01:29:51.185 --> 01:29:53.087
It's money for Henry's school.

01:29:54.988 --> 01:29:57.022
Shit, what am I
gonna tell Henry?

01:29:57.024 --> 01:29:58.259
I already know.

01:30:02.630 --> 01:30:04.664
We're in a studio apartment.

01:30:08.234 --> 01:30:09.369
Are you okay?

01:30:11.773 --> 01:30:14.942
I guess I just realized
why you love animals so much.

01:30:46.239 --> 01:30:48.540
It's gonna be okay, Laura.

01:30:48.542 --> 01:30:52.012
You're a survivor, like all
those animals you save.

01:30:54.247 --> 01:30:56.915
How'd you end up being
the sane one?

01:30:56.917 --> 01:31:00.317
Guess I've just always seen
Dad for who he really is.

01:31:00.319 --> 01:31:01.952
Someone we love?

01:31:01.954 --> 01:31:04.923
Yeah, only slightly better
than our worst ex-boyfriend.

01:31:04.925 --> 01:31:06.391
That is so sad.

01:31:06.393 --> 01:31:10.094
We'll never be more interesting
than Dad's adventures.

01:31:10.096 --> 01:31:15.233
I always used to think that if
I could be like Debbie Gibson

01:31:15.235 --> 01:31:19.271
or Tiffany or Robert Smith
of The Cure, then maybe...

01:31:19.273 --> 01:31:20.539
Yes.

01:31:20.541 --> 01:31:23.610
But it's a no-go, so...

01:31:24.610 --> 01:31:26.577
I think you're interesting.

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:28.874
Yeah.
Yeah, there it is.

01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:31.643
Okay.
Could you roll me? Quick.

01:32:31.645 --> 01:32:33.844
Yeah, sure.

01:32:33.846 --> 01:32:35.580
Okay, back of the sleeves.

01:32:35.582 --> 01:32:37.885
- I'll be like five minutes, okay?
- Okay.

01:32:40.921 --> 01:32:42.123
Hi.

01:32:43.856 --> 01:32:45.690
Nice wheels.

01:32:45.692 --> 01:32:47.092
- Thanks.
- Nice puppy!

01:32:47.094 --> 01:32:48.826
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:32:48.828 --> 01:32:50.829
I missed you.

01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:52.229
Yes, I did.

01:32:52.231 --> 01:32:54.732
- Oh, I missed you so much.
- Yeah, she missed you, too.

01:32:54.734 --> 01:32:55.901
Nice sling.

01:32:55.903 --> 01:32:59.204
Oh, only the best
for the best.

01:32:59.206 --> 01:33:00.539
She did okay?

01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:04.375
Oh, yeah,
we found ourselves a routine.

01:33:04.377 --> 01:33:07.715
Eat, sleep, poop, repeat.

01:33:09.349 --> 01:33:10.650
Well, thank you.

01:33:11.719 --> 01:33:13.818
Uh, I was thinking I could...

01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:15.919
You know, I could hang onto
her for a few more days,

01:33:15.921 --> 01:33:17.722
let you get some rest.

01:33:17.724 --> 01:33:20.258
You fell in love with her,
didn't you?

01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:23.597
- Oh, you did.
- It snuck up on me.

01:33:24.930 --> 01:33:27.331
I haven't slept more than
45 minutes at a time,

01:33:27.333 --> 01:33:31.336
so my judgment could be
slightly clouded, but...

01:33:31.338 --> 01:33:32.771
But I actually enjoyed
the chaos.

01:33:32.773 --> 01:33:35.775
Look at you. Spoken like
a true dog rescuer.

01:33:37.743 --> 01:33:39.279
How was the trip?

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:45.916
It was... It was good.

01:33:45.918 --> 01:33:50.754
I think what you do for these
animals is, is amazing.

01:33:50.756 --> 01:33:54.127
They do more for me. I just
feed them when they're hungry.

01:33:57.965 --> 01:33:59.967
Uh, so Friday?

01:34:00.466 --> 01:34:01.768
Our date?

01:34:03.603 --> 01:34:04.838
Yeah?

01:34:06.606 --> 01:34:07.805
Sure.

01:34:07.807 --> 01:34:08.908
Yes!

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.012
Yes.

01:34:25.492 --> 01:34:28.527
Well, at least we got money
for private school.

01:34:28.529 --> 01:34:30.331
That's pretty cool, isn't it?

01:34:31.198 --> 01:34:32.466
Yeah.

01:34:45.011 --> 01:34:48.679
I'm so sorry, Henry.
I don't even know what to say.

01:34:48.681 --> 01:34:50.550
I know you're disappointed.

01:34:59.726 --> 01:35:01.261
We're gonna be okay.

01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:03.497
Yeah?

01:35:06.199 --> 01:35:08.402
I'm sorry
I didn't realize that before.

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:36.126
What is that?

01:35:36.128 --> 01:35:38.164
FBI! Open up!

01:35:38.765 --> 01:35:40.632
Jesus. Shit.

01:35:40.634 --> 01:35:42.201
He must have stuffed some weed
in our bags.

01:35:42.203 --> 01:35:43.500
- FBI!
- Fuck!

01:35:45.003 --> 01:35:47.170
FBI! Open up!

01:35:47.172 --> 01:35:49.575
God. Fuck. Shit.

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:50.875
- Shit, shit, shit!
- What do we do?

01:35:50.877 --> 01:35:53.143
- Just go...
- FBI! Open up!

01:35:53.145 --> 01:35:56.481
Okay, flush anything
you find. Okay?

01:35:56.483 --> 01:35:58.583
I don't know, chuck the
suitcases out the window.

01:35:58.585 --> 01:36:00.552
- Hurry. Go.
- FBI!

01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:02.856
Open up,
or we take the door down!

01:36:13.567 --> 01:36:18.903
You bunch of chickenshits.
I heard you scrambling around.

01:36:18.905 --> 01:36:20.640
"Flush everything!"

01:36:22.609 --> 01:36:24.976
Oh, for Jesus Christ.

01:36:24.978 --> 01:36:28.082
You could never be a criminal
if your life depended on it.

01:36:31.984 --> 01:36:33.420
You were very convincing.

01:36:35.588 --> 01:36:37.955
What are you doing?

01:36:37.957 --> 01:36:39.960
- Did you drive here?
- Yeah, I left yesterday.

01:36:40.993 --> 01:36:42.960
Oh, yes.

01:36:42.962 --> 01:36:46.533
My place is here
with you two fuck-ups.

01:36:48.768 --> 01:36:50.371
You want to live here?

01:36:51.404 --> 01:36:52.803
With us?

01:36:52.805 --> 01:36:57.310
I don't know if I'm
capable of change, but...

01:36:59.913 --> 01:37:05.983
I sure as hell
would like to try.

01:37:05.985 --> 01:37:10.490
I mean, well, I should be enjoying
my, uh, twilight years, but...

01:37:11.257 --> 01:37:13.325
I've...

01:37:13.327 --> 01:37:16.697
I've been inspired by Gandhi.

01:37:21.266 --> 01:37:22.670
Who's this?

01:37:24.137 --> 01:37:25.970
Gandhi.

01:37:25.972 --> 01:37:30.008
Uh, I found him in a dumpster.

01:37:30.010 --> 01:37:32.880
Can you believe someone would throw
this son of a bitch away? Gee...

01:37:58.337 --> 01:37:59.639
Good morning.

01:38:00.873 --> 01:38:02.076
Morning.

01:38:04.944 --> 01:38:06.710
You went food shopping?

01:38:06.712 --> 01:38:08.916
Well, the kid would starve to death
with what you had in the fridge.

01:38:10.817 --> 01:38:12.853
Uh, I made him lunch, too.

01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:20.525
A joint and an apple?

01:38:20.527 --> 01:38:23.831

help him make some friends.
