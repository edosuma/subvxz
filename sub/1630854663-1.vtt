- Well, I'd love to hear it.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.660
The night Isabel was killed,

29:52.760 --> 29:56.500
she attended her Year 12 formal
at the school, here.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.660
Not long before it ended,
she went outside

29:58.760 --> 30:04.300
and gave directions to someone in
a blue station wagon, with a white door.

30:04.400 --> 30:09.740
Her friend, Chloe Walcott,
witnessed the interaction.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.780
She didn't see the driver,
but she remembers that

30:11.880 --> 30:14.620
the car had interstate plates.

30:14.720 --> 30:17.780
Now, after the formal,
both girls walked home together,

30:17.880 --> 30:20.460
up to the Riley Street T-intersection.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.460
Chloe went left, Isabel right,

30:23.560 --> 30:27.900
and walked the last 2km
to her house alone.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.220
And that's where he got her.

30:30.320 --> 30:33.780
We didn't really have any CCTV
in town back then,

30:33.880 --> 30:37.920
BUT the ATM on Main Street had a camera.

31:00.320 --> 31:03.540
We think he was a seasonal worker
passing through town,

31:03.640 --> 31:05.380
we had loads of them back then.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.220
He waited until she was alone,

31:07.320 --> 31:10.140
and then tried to drag her into the car.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.540
She must have fought back hard,

31:11.640 --> 31:14.660
because we found blood on her hand
that didn't belong to her.

31:14.760 --> 31:18.140
And then as she tried to run,
that's when he hit her.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.660
Blunt force trauma.

31:20.760 --> 31:22.980
Single blow to the side of the head.

31:23.080 --> 31:26.020

outside the cemetery

on his way out of town.

31:29.560 --> 31:31.740

That's your theory, huh?

31:31.840 --> 31:35.020

walking home late at night -

31:35.120 --> 31:37.100
it's a tale as old as time.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.880

31:41.480 --> 31:44.380

31:44.480 --> 31:46.220
You read the case file?

31:46.320 --> 31:47.340
Yes.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.300
And now I'm just trying to figure out

31:49.400 --> 31:52.920
how the hair trophy
fits in with your theory.

31:53.920 --> 31:55.060
Well, I don't know.

31:55.160 --> 31:58.300
Maybe he was a serial killer
in the making, or a fucking wig maker.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.580
We didn't find him, so I couldn't ask.

32:00.680 --> 32:04.460
But I followed every avenue
of this investigation,

32:04.560 --> 32:08.440
and all roads, my friend,
led back to this car.

32:09.680 --> 32:12.740
I'm sure your investigation
was very thorough,

32:12.840 --> 32:15.560
but obviously
there's new information now.

32:16.640 --> 32:18.900

to work together

life in Ashford looks like today.

his camera, and his expertise,

34:21.840 --> 34:23.020

34:26.320 --> 34:28.740
History. Your history.

34:28.840 --> 34:33.100
This... This is a chance for you to
wrap up a little piece of your lives

34:33.200 --> 34:35.680
for a future generation to discover.

34:37.920 --> 34:41.180
Or I could just stick you all
on lunchtime bin duty for two weeks.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.940
No, no, sounds fun, Miss Walcott.

'cause my mum's gonna see it.

35:37.560 --> 35:39.460

two versions of the video,

as in, like, show the clean one
to your mum,

I could switch the tapes

your uncle's fishing shack, right?

38:36.840 --> 38:37.740
No way.

Yeah, or what about that abandoned house
down on Harpers Road.

to Sydney this summer,

planning this for?

before I told you.

Oh, certain? You're already certain.

So are you just breaking up with me,
is that right?

No.

I love you.

39:55.040 --> 39:56.180

but I honestly wasn't sure
until we bought the van.

but we should have it back soon.

Wait, Mick Compton?

So you just decided to tell him
before you even bothered to tell me.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.940
He knows heaps about cars.
We needed his advice.

40:08.040 --> 40:10.960
Well, maybe you should take him
on the trip with you, then.

- It's late.

- Yeah. Sorry, I...

You know, I...

I asked her to put this in,
but I never knew if she did or not.

I was actually planning on
coming to see you and your parents

43:53.040 --> 43:54.140

I don't want my parents
getting dragged through this again.

43:56.360 --> 43:58.420
I understand.

43:58.520 --> 44:01.420
But, ultimately,
I will have to speak with them.

- You don't know my family.
- No, I don't.

is promising new information.

there's a motive, closer to home.
