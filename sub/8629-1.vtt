WEBVTT

01:38.431 --> 01:40.432
Almost got hung myself once.

01:42.018 --> 01:44.353
Didn't care for it much.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.106
How about you?

01:49.943 --> 01:51.693
We'll leave you now.

01:52.695 --> 01:55.030
Don't want anyone to see me here...

01:55.198 --> 01:58.534
get the crazy notion that I was
somehow connected with your...

01:58.701 --> 02:00.285
accidental death.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.163
On the other hand...

02:03.331 --> 02:06.875
it's not good for a man
to be out here alone.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.211
The mind can do terrible things.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.299
Enjoy the company.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.028
Oh, snakes.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.291
Don't go without me,
all right, Ollie?

02:47.458 --> 02:48.792
Lord...

02:48.960 --> 02:52.171
whatever I've done
to piss you off...

02:52.338 --> 02:54.590
if you'd just
get me out of this...

02:54.757 --> 02:58.427
let me know what it was,
I'll rectify the situation.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.680
It had just been a shitty week
for me from the beginning.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.017
It all started when I was heading
into Crystal River...

03:05.185 --> 03:07.269
to take some money
from the bank.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.564
I should've known there was
bad luck on the horizon...

03:10.732 --> 03:12.274
when my horse got stolen...

03:12.442 --> 03:16.445
and I had to replace it with
something less than a thoroughbred.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.536
My luck had to change fast.

03:24.787 --> 03:28.790
The poker game of the century
was four days away in St. Louis...

03:28.958 --> 03:32.961
and I was still $3,000 short
of the entrance fee.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.964
There was no way in hell
I would miss that game.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.218
Not just because there was
a half-million dollar pot to be won...

03:39.385 --> 03:42.387
although that kind of money
certainly demands attention...

03:42.555 --> 03:46.642
but because I needed to know
how good I really was.

03:46.809 --> 03:48.685
Once and for all.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.745
I had to hole up here
for the night.

05:30.496 --> 05:33.248
Business would have to wait
till morning.

05:38.546 --> 05:40.005
Big fella.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.591
- Hello, sir.
- Hi, son.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.719
How much?

05:45.887 --> 05:47.262
By the day, week or month?

05:47.430 --> 05:52.225
No, no. Not how much to take care of him,
how much to just take him. Permanently.

05:52.393 --> 05:55.729
Pa! This man wants to know
if you wanna buy a burro.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.523
That burro ain't worth a dollar.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.943
Well, sir,
I say you got yourself a deal.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.447
Here's your dollar.

06:05.615 --> 06:09.618
He doesn't eat much,
but he's a regular jackass.

06:10.370 --> 06:14.164
And he-aw, he-aw, he always likes
to be called Arthur.

06:14.832 --> 06:18.835
From the moment I slapped eyes
on this hombre, I smelled trouble...

06:19.045 --> 06:21.046
and refried beans.

06:21.714 --> 06:25.967
Something else told me that this
was not just a chance meeting.

06:54.872 --> 06:58.417
I'll see your 10 and I'll raise you 10.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.339
I call.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.216
- What do you got?
- Full house.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.427
That beats me.

07:08.719 --> 07:11.847
Damn. You are a lucky lady.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.237
Is this seat taken?

07:27.405 --> 07:29.489
It is now.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.868
My name is Annabelle Bransford.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.578
What do they call you?

07:34.745 --> 07:37.080
Bret Maverick.
I'm pleased to meet you.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.166
I like the game the way it is.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.962
Well, I bring all sorts
of pluses to the table.

07:44.338 --> 07:47.507
I hardly ever bluff
and I never, ever cheat.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.719
I don't believe it.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.345
Neither do I.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.890
I like the game just the way it is.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.766
What good is an empty chair?

07:57.268 --> 07:58.560
Indeed.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.687
I'll bet I can change your mind.

08:01.856 --> 08:05.108
I promise that I will lose
for at least an hour.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.319
- I like that.
- Sounds good.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.945
My kind of player.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.989
We're playing five-card draw.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.532
Please, sit down.

08:12.700 --> 08:15.952
My name is
Mrs. Annabelle Bransford.

08:16.120 --> 08:19.915
I caught that before, ma'am.
Except the "Mrs."

08:20.082 --> 08:21.750
Ante up.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.251
I'm in.

08:23.419 --> 08:24.920
Same game. Chips, sir.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.380
You can lose as much as you want.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.759
Two hundred.

08:33.304 --> 08:36.306
- You did say you'd lose for an hour.
- I'm a man of my word.

08:36.474 --> 08:37.557
I know.

08:44.815 --> 08:46.316
Place your bets.

10:17.074 --> 10:18.450
It's about time.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.544
I'll see you...

10:30.963 --> 10:32.922
and raise you 20.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.508
Slow down,
I'm running low on chips.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.844
I'll see your bet and...

10:39.847 --> 10:41.556
I'll call.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.308
Two pair. Aces over queens.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.977
Lucky for me, I had 3 sixes.

10:49.565 --> 10:50.690
Sorry.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.320
Nice pot.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.905
Broke your losing streak.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.032
That one shouldn't count.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.034
Beg your pardon?

11:01.202 --> 11:03.161
I don't think
that hand should count.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.790
You got any logical reasons
why not?

11:07.416 --> 11:09.793
My mind wasn't on the game.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.461
His mind wasn't on the...

11:14.757 --> 11:15.965
What's your name, son?

11:16.133 --> 11:18.718
- Johnny.
- You got a last name?

11:18.886 --> 11:20.470
Johnny Hardin.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.894
What's your occupation?

11:28.062 --> 11:29.229
I'm a gunfighter.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.362
I have to assume
since you're still alive...

11:37.530 --> 11:39.948
and playing cards with us...

11:40.116 --> 11:42.283
that you're good at it.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.953
Care to find out?

11:48.374 --> 11:52.085
Gentlemen, this hand definitely
does not count. Take it all.

11:52.253 --> 11:56.464
Whatever you think's fair, and
I'll be content with the leavings.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.091
You always been gutless?

12:00.970 --> 12:04.556
I think so. For as long
as I can remember, at any rate.

12:04.724 --> 12:08.768
My old pappy used to say,
"He who fights and runs away...

12:09.061 --> 12:11.187
can run away another day."

12:17.319 --> 12:18.862
What?

12:19.029 --> 12:20.405
Look, I don't see...

12:24.034 --> 12:25.577
Slow down there.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.079
Where's the fire, son?

12:29.498 --> 12:34.002
Slow down. Don't shoot me, okay?
I'm just trying to expound.

12:34.170 --> 12:37.505
I was saying, I don't see
what's so great about being brave.

12:37.673 --> 12:40.592
I mean, I'm a card player.
You know, I play cards.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.178
Call me a gambler.
I want to become an old gambler.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.180
You are a gunfighter.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.516
An exceptional one at that,
from what I hear.

12:48.684 --> 12:52.562
If I went up against you, what
chance would I have had? Answer?

12:53.105 --> 12:54.689
Zero.

13:00.237 --> 13:02.697
Absolutely none whatsoever.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.326
Wanna see it again?

13:11.248 --> 13:13.625
Damn thing won't stay
in the holster.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.461
Whoop! I must have a spring in there.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.797
Come on, let's just play poker.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.466
Who wants to play poker?

13:22.468 --> 13:25.136
Who wants to see
someone get killed?

13:25.763 --> 13:28.389
No. Let's play poker.

13:28.557 --> 13:30.809
I'd rather be rich than dead.

13:34.563 --> 13:37.190
Was that fast?
I thought that was fast.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.400
Was it fast? Was it?

13:39.568 --> 13:41.361
Yeah.

13:42.404 --> 13:45.073
Now, what was it? Stud?

13:46.075 --> 13:48.284
I think I prefer draw!

13:49.662 --> 13:51.287
Just kidding.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.123
Sorry. I couldn't resist it.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.836
My ante's in.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.770
- I'll raise you 75.
- Oh, 75.

14:15.938 --> 14:19.274
Well, that's...
That more than takes care of your bet.

14:19.441 --> 14:23.444
And I'll raise you whatever that is,
looks like 100.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.827
Shit! I fold.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.624
Hey, you never paid to look...

14:36.792 --> 14:38.501
You said you never bluffed.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.211
I had a pair of aces!

14:40.379 --> 14:44.340
No, I said I never cheated
and I also said I hardly ever bluff.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.134
This is one of the "hardlys."

14:46.302 --> 14:48.511
You've been cheating
the whole game.

14:48.679 --> 14:52.140
What do you think I was doing
during that first hour?

14:52.391 --> 14:54.934
I was learning your tells.

14:55.477 --> 14:58.313
Your weakness comes
when you get your hand...

14:58.480 --> 15:02.400
shuffle the cards back and forth
and act a little fidgety.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.194
I just called you a cheat.

15:05.362 --> 15:08.323
You also called me gutless...

15:08.490 --> 15:11.284
but I figured
you were just teasing.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.786
Get your hands off him!

15:13.954 --> 15:16.497
We get him first!

15:16.665 --> 15:21.169
When I seen you through the window,
I believed in the Almighty.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.587
You were drinking.

15:22.796 --> 15:25.590
A lot. And you played bad.
Whose fault is that?

15:25.758 --> 15:29.677
Yours, you bastard!
It's all your fault!

15:29.845 --> 15:32.388
It's our time now.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.197
- I think there's gonna be a fight.
- Come here, son.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.408
I want you
to hold onto this for me.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.828
If they get to whupping me...

15:55.996 --> 15:57.705
you have my permission
to shoot me.

15:57.873 --> 15:59.415
- Shoot you?
- Shoot me.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.376
See this gets no dirt on it.
Thank you.

16:01.543 --> 16:04.170
Good luck! I get to hold it.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.687
I'm going to cut you up...

16:20.854 --> 16:21.896
fancy man!

17:10.404 --> 17:12.280
- You're a pretty good fighter.
- Thank you.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.699
- I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.
- Me too.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.367
- By the way, I won 20 cents.
- Twenty cents?

17:18.454 --> 17:20.454
Thanks to my lucky shirt.

17:20.622 --> 17:21.998
Speaking of my 20 cents...

17:42.394 --> 17:46.564
All right. All right! My shirt's damaged!
Damn!

17:46.732 --> 17:49.567
What the hell else bad
can happen? You!

17:49.735 --> 17:53.029
What did you say before?
You called me something.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.907
- Nothing important.
- He called you a gutless coward.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.285
I did not say that. I might've said
a gutless cheat...

17:59.453 --> 18:01.788
- But not a coward.
- Cheat? Cheat?

18:01.955 --> 18:03.331
I was teasing.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.416
- Teasing?
- Teasing.

18:09.546 --> 18:11.255
I don't like being teased.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.468
Hey. My friend, I'm sorry.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.555
Now I'm teasing you.

18:20.974 --> 18:23.392
Let's play poker.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.523
Oh, ma'am. Here. Let me get your chair.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.651
That was truly amazing.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.529
I just get lucky sometimes.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.574
Whose deal was it? Mine?

18:38.784 --> 18:42.286
Excuse me. Think I'm through
with y'all for the evening.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.205
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.749
Good night, son.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.668
Five-card draw all right?

18:48.836 --> 18:50.545
Whatever.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.588
Mind if I take six?

18:54.842 --> 18:57.718
Little poker humor.
I'm just teasing you again.

19:20.576 --> 19:21.617
Who is it?

19:21.827 --> 19:23.161
Annabelle Bransford.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.260
I shouldn't be doing this.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.638
You're just standing
in the hallway.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.932
That's still legal in this state.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.270
If only I weren't a married woman.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.284
I couldn't help myself.

20:03.785 --> 20:07.121
My very being cried out
to hold you.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.624
Stop by anytime.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.461
I know we may never
see each other again...

20:13.795 --> 20:16.088
so I think it's safe to say...

20:17.090 --> 20:18.341
you are the most...

20:18.508 --> 20:22.470
blindingly attractive man
that I've ever seen.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.559
Goodbye.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.070
How can I possibly go on...

20:39.279 --> 20:40.655
without my wallet?

20:42.658 --> 20:45.660
If you don't give back my money,
I'll have your ass in jail.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.161
Damn!

20:47.329 --> 20:49.997
Don't get mad at me. I can't help it
if you're a miserable thief.

20:50.290 --> 20:54.335
I'm a very good thief.
I just been having bad luck.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.504
I know what that's all about.

20:56.797 --> 21:00.675
Where're you from?
Your accent could use some work too.

21:01.969 --> 21:06.180
- Most gentlemen enjoy my Southern.
- That's not in dispute.

21:06.348 --> 21:09.600
But I'll bet there is
no Mr. Bransford, is there?

21:10.519 --> 21:14.313
No, and there never will be,
thank you very much.

21:15.190 --> 21:19.860
Now what do we do?
You're not going to turn me in, are you?

21:20.028 --> 21:22.613
I am law-abiding.
It's my duty to turn you in.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.032
I'm afraid I'll have to...

21:26.868 --> 21:30.579
What the hell. I got my money back
and there's no harm done.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.707
Let's just call it square,
shall we?

21:39.715 --> 21:40.798
Damn!

21:41.842 --> 21:42.883
What?

21:43.927 --> 21:47.471
You're just so irritating
and likable.

21:48.223 --> 21:50.057
I have to work on that, I guess.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.892
There you go, all likable again.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.814
You know, I...

21:57.733 --> 22:02.945
I think that had we known each other
under different circumstances...

22:03.238 --> 22:05.239
we'd have hated each other.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.580
There's no Mrs. Maverick?

22:12.748 --> 22:15.458
I'm sure I would've remembered.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.337
May I?

22:43.612 --> 22:45.780
I wish we'd never met.

22:46.615 --> 22:50.951
Goodbye.

23:16.603 --> 23:17.853
She did it.

23:19.314 --> 23:21.315
Son of a bitch.

23:30.826 --> 23:31.909
Can I be of some help?

23:34.621 --> 23:35.830
What?

23:36.456 --> 23:38.833
You have to admit
I was much better the second time.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.293
Not just better. You were good.

23:41.461 --> 23:43.421
- I was?
- Very good.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.131
Thank you.

23:46.007 --> 23:49.468
And now
it's time you do something I want.

23:49.678 --> 23:53.013
How dare you? I'm a lady.
Not in a million years!

23:53.306 --> 23:55.850
Not if you or I were 100 years old...

23:56.143 --> 23:58.227
Shut up! I don't want
to go to bed with you.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.062
Why not?

24:00.355 --> 24:03.524
Why not? I'd be too frightened!

24:03.692 --> 24:06.527
If I dozed, God knows
what parts of me you'd steal.

24:06.820 --> 24:10.072
I'd wake up
with all sorts of things missing.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.159
But I don't know
how to clean this...

24:13.368 --> 24:15.578
and, obviously,
you must know how to.

24:15.745 --> 24:18.706
The laundry's closed,
I leave early and you owe me.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.207
Easy on the starch.

24:21.543 --> 24:27.631
If I can't touch you,
I can touch your shirt and dream.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.925
- Want a hand?
- Yes, thank you.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.396
Thank you.

24:42.564 --> 24:44.190
Good night, Bert.

24:44.357 --> 24:45.941
Bret.

24:46.109 --> 24:48.402
Bret. That's my name. Bret.

25:23.104 --> 25:24.647
- Good morning.
- Morning.

25:24.940 --> 25:28.400
- Is Eugene in?
- Yes, sir, but he's bus...

25:37.911 --> 25:39.119
Eugene?

25:39.329 --> 25:41.747
Get up,
you bald-headed reprobate!

25:41.957 --> 25:43.123
- On your feet!
- Don't shoot.

25:43.416 --> 25:46.418
- I need some cash.
- I know a desert flower...

25:46.628 --> 25:47.962
Shut up!

25:48.171 --> 25:49.922
- Put the cash on the table.
- I don't have any.

25:50.131 --> 25:51.215
Robbery!

25:52.592 --> 25:55.970
Robert, no! It's all right.

25:56.137 --> 25:58.556
It's my friend Bret saying hello.

25:58.807 --> 26:01.600
- Tell everybody everything's okay.
- Yes, sir.

26:02.143 --> 26:04.562
- Son of a bitch.
- Silly bastard.

26:04.813 --> 26:08.524
- How are things going?
- Things couldn't be worse.

26:08.692 --> 26:10.526
I know I owe you $1,000.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.529
- That's what I came for.
- Would you take 100?

26:13.697 --> 26:17.491
I've never welshed on a debt.
Give me to year's end.

26:18.159 --> 26:22.288
The end of the?
I need that money right now.

26:22.455 --> 26:23.664
Oh, for the?

26:23.832 --> 26:25.791
For the poker championship,
the All Rivers.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.459
How much to enter?

26:27.669 --> 26:30.504
Twenty-five thousand dollars.

26:30.672 --> 26:33.507
I'm $3,000 short,
but with Joseph and you...

26:33.800 --> 26:35.175
Pork Chop Slim owed me...

26:35.468 --> 26:38.012
but his widow used the money
for his funeral.

26:38.179 --> 26:40.139
They never found the body.

26:40.307 --> 26:43.017
- What?
- They never found his body.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.353
The widow Pork Chop conned me.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.856
What's with people nowadays?

26:49.149 --> 26:53.277
I know. You can't trust them.
Take my last 100.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.405
I can't.
What about Matilda and the kid?

26:58.158 --> 27:00.993
- Bank robbery!
- I told you...

27:01.161 --> 27:02.828
You heard him! Bank robbery!

27:04.539 --> 27:06.707
I'll take this, gunslinger.

27:06.916 --> 27:09.376
Empty your pockets, old man.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.670
I got a silver dollar.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.256
Do better!
My trigger finger's itchy.

27:14.424 --> 27:17.343
All right, don't shoot, don't shoot.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.930
- Take it.
- What? Look at this.

27:22.223 --> 27:24.475
Well, I'll be. Jesus.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.728
Hundreds and thousands.

27:28.021 --> 27:30.356
- You said you were broke!
- I am now! He's got it.

27:30.565 --> 27:33.525
- And I'll get the rest too!
- I don't have any more.

27:33.735 --> 27:37.071
Pull those pockets out.
Turn around!

27:37.364 --> 27:39.448
- Hurry up! Hey!
- I'm sorry.

27:41.701 --> 27:42.910
Give me that!

27:45.914 --> 27:51.585
- Nah.
- Nah.

27:52.295 --> 27:54.171
Let's blow the safe!

27:54.422 --> 27:57.424
- Light up!
- Heads down, everybody!

28:00.595 --> 28:04.181
- I'm younger than you.
- I should be under...

28:10.730 --> 28:13.190
I'm getting too old for this shit.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.445
Hi-yah! Yah!

28:24.411 --> 28:27.955
You sons of bitches
beat me by a day!

28:29.541 --> 28:31.291
Eugene!

28:31.710 --> 28:33.293
You're holding out.

28:33.503 --> 28:36.714
Bret, that's all I got left!

28:38.883 --> 28:39.925
Maverick!

28:42.637 --> 28:44.138
Hey!

28:44.305 --> 28:46.473
Bret Maverick!

28:46.641 --> 28:48.934
Nothing to worry about.

28:49.477 --> 28:51.979
We want to talk to you, pal.

28:53.481 --> 28:55.023
Where are you going?

28:55.817 --> 28:57.359
Got you now!

28:59.529 --> 29:01.488
- Anybody see you?
- Not a soul.

29:01.781 --> 29:04.283
You fellas come in any later last night...

29:04.492 --> 29:06.160
that monster would've eaten me alive.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.787
We saw that.
Anybody suspect anything?

29:08.997 --> 29:10.998
Not a thing. You were great!

29:11.249 --> 29:12.833
We enjoyed it.

29:13.126 --> 29:14.501
No kidding.

29:14.669 --> 29:16.170
Thanks for taking it easy on us.

29:16.379 --> 29:19.715
Easy? Those were my best shots.

29:19.883 --> 29:22.760
The one there rung my bell a little bit.

29:22.927 --> 29:24.511
That's good.

29:24.679 --> 29:26.013
You owe us $5 apiece.

29:26.181 --> 29:29.558
- Five bucks.
- Damn right, $5 a beating.

29:31.811 --> 29:34.313
You boys may or
may not believe this.

29:34.522 --> 29:38.400
They cleaned the bank and me out.
I'll have to owe you.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.486
Are you saying...

29:40.695 --> 29:44.490
you don't have our money
for taking your best shots?

29:44.824 --> 29:48.619
- Killing me won't make you richer.
- Sure gonna make me feel better.

29:50.163 --> 29:51.872
You got a point there.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.791
Let's see here.

29:55.877 --> 29:57.920
I'm sorry. I forgot!

29:58.213 --> 29:59.546
I honestly forgot.

29:59.798 --> 30:02.007
I always keep something pinned
inside my vest...

30:02.217 --> 30:04.051
for such a rainy day occasion.

30:04.219 --> 30:07.054
It's a good thing.
It was clouding up pretty quick.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.141
That's a $100 bill.

30:11.309 --> 30:16.104
- A $100 bill?
- But I do need some change.

30:16.272 --> 30:20.567
- Eighty will be close enough, 75...
- Let's see what we got.

30:22.445 --> 30:25.197
- I got 17 here.
- Seventeen dollars?

30:25.406 --> 30:27.366
- That's right.
- You owe me $8 for a month.

30:27.575 --> 30:30.536
- We'll settle that later.
- You always cheat me.

30:30.745 --> 30:32.579
- I can't believe you!
- Close enough.

30:32.831 --> 30:36.750
You came out better
than you think. Nice working with you.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.378
You keep this
under your hats, okay?

30:39.587 --> 30:41.338
News travels fast in the old West.

30:41.506 --> 30:45.342
A $100 bill! That's...

30:46.886 --> 30:48.470
25 apiece.

31:07.198 --> 31:11.034
Ever since I was a kid,
I believed I had a gift.

31:11.202 --> 31:14.162
That if I thought hard enough
about a card...

31:14.622 --> 31:16.999
I'd be able
to cut straight to it.

31:19.460 --> 31:22.671
My old pappy always said
I was a damn fool.

31:22.964 --> 31:27.467
But I knew if I really believed
and made it happen, then that...

31:27.635 --> 31:30.929
would be
nothing short of magic.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.435
Damn!

31:36.603 --> 31:37.978
Of course, it didn't always work.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.396
What do I expect?

31:40.982 --> 31:43.275
In fact, it had never worked.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.953
You sweet woman.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.669
Lucky shirt. Yes.

32:13.514 --> 32:16.350
Mrs. Bransford. Mrs. Bransford!

32:18.061 --> 32:19.853
Wait! You!

32:20.021 --> 32:23.774
Wait there. I'm... No! You...
Wait!

32:35.078 --> 32:37.412
Hold up the ferry!
Don't go without me!

32:48.466 --> 32:50.384
You did this on purpose.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.469
You bet I did.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.304
This is my lucky shirt.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.556
Do your own laundry then.

32:57.225 --> 32:59.476
My underwear comes from New York.

32:59.644 --> 33:02.229
Got any idea
where this shirt was made?

33:02.397 --> 33:04.982
Paris, France, that's where!

33:05.233 --> 33:08.360
I can't go to the nearest dry goods store
to pick up another one!

33:08.736 --> 33:11.905
Why don't you try
the kiddie department?

33:12.407 --> 33:14.282
Remove your hands from the lady.

33:16.244 --> 33:20.122
When you least expect it,
your hero arrives. Mister?

33:20.748 --> 33:23.125
Zane Cooper.
Folks call me Coop.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.252
- Suits me just fine.
- Coop.

33:25.503 --> 33:28.714
This creature's named Maverick.
I'm Annabelle Bransford.

33:28.923 --> 33:32.050
- I'll be taking this coach.
- So am I.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.011
That ought to be fun.

33:34.262 --> 33:38.390
Lord knows what that ruffian might've done
had we been alone on the stage for two days.

33:38.599 --> 33:41.935
I hope you can relax
and enjoy the journey now.

33:42.228 --> 33:46.273
My feeling is that
if there weren't any women...

33:46.733 --> 33:48.400
none of us would be here.

33:48.651 --> 33:51.945
What kind of sense does that make?

33:52.238 --> 33:54.781
If there were no men,
we wouldn't be here either.

33:54.949 --> 33:56.533
Are you mocking me?

33:56.701 --> 33:59.619
Don't get ruffled.
I was agreeing with you...

33:59.912 --> 34:02.122
in a totally unusual way.

34:02.290 --> 34:06.585
What would this world come to
without gentlemen like yourself?

34:09.964 --> 34:12.299
A passenger! Come ahead.

34:12.550 --> 34:15.802
Right this way, sir. Want a hand?

34:17.929 --> 34:19.806
I'm the driver.

34:21.100 --> 34:22.601
Are you all right?

34:22.810 --> 34:24.936
Why does everybody ask me that?

34:25.146 --> 34:28.398
Get me up there so
we can get this thing going.

34:46.501 --> 34:49.668
I think it's about time
we get to know each other.

34:49.962 --> 34:53.130
Mr. Maverick has aspirations
to be a card player.

34:53.341 --> 34:56.885
I'm not ignorant of cards.
Can't be in my line of work.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.888
- And pray, what might that be?
- Lawman.

35:00.056 --> 35:04.643
I bet you're the best there is.
I can tell things about a man.

35:04.811 --> 35:08.814
I can't quite place your accent.
Where in the South are you from?

35:08.981 --> 35:11.358
Ever been to Mobile?

35:11.692 --> 35:13.401
That's where I'm from.

35:13.569 --> 35:15.987
Mobile, Alabama?
Hell, I been there.

35:16.155 --> 35:19.074
I'll bet we know the same people.
You start.

35:20.159 --> 35:22.452
I've tried so hard
to forget that place.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.996
I endured
such personal tragedy there.

35:28.334 --> 35:31.169
A woman's suffering
is not a funny thing, Bertie.

35:31.879 --> 35:33.421
There are exceptions.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.175
Watch your billfold.

35:49.772 --> 35:51.398
Hey, old-timer!

35:51.649 --> 35:55.068
The thief and the old guy
find it bumpy back here!

36:29.604 --> 36:33.565
How could you face them all down?
Nine men, all of them armed?

36:33.774 --> 36:38.111
A man gives his word to do his job,
he's honor bound to do it.

36:38.279 --> 36:40.113
- Weren't you afraid?
- A mite.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.700
Maverick doesn't believe in bravery.

36:43.951 --> 36:47.120
I think bravery's a fine thing...

36:47.330 --> 36:51.124
just overrated is all,
and doesn't suit me personally.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.294
- I just realized something.
- What's that?

36:54.795 --> 36:56.379
You're spineless.

36:56.547 --> 36:59.799
That's right.
It's kept me alive a long time.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.275
You fellas got a problem?

37:17.818 --> 37:19.152
Heavens to Betsy, no!

37:20.655 --> 37:22.739
What's the joke?

37:22.990 --> 37:25.742
- You, Pancho. You're the joke.
- Explain that.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.828
You'll have to pay us
more money than Maverick did.

37:33.834 --> 37:34.918
He paid you to fall down?

37:35.086 --> 37:36.795
Paid us good too.

37:37.004 --> 37:39.339
That's right. A $100 bill.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.342
- That's a good day's work.
- That's right.

37:43.552 --> 37:45.762
You fellas ought to see me first.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.640
I'd have let you fall down for free.

38:08.995 --> 38:11.663
Maverick is mine, anyway.

38:11.914 --> 38:13.665
But this time it's personal.

38:24.593 --> 38:26.845
Hundred dollar bill. Ha!

38:43.029 --> 38:44.696
Is he taking a short cut?

38:55.207 --> 38:58.376
Hey, old-timer, wake up!
Wake...

39:03.924 --> 39:06.217
- Is he asleep?
- It's more serious than that.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.094
- He's dead.
- Dead?

39:08.429 --> 39:09.763
Yeah.

39:09.972 --> 39:13.641
- Get up and stop the stage.
- Me? I just put a fresh shirt on.

39:13.934 --> 39:16.478
- You stop the stage!
- Because this wheel's loose.

39:16.771 --> 39:19.731
If it comes off, we're all dead.
Stop the stage.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.359
- I'll take care of the wheel.
- All right.

39:22.610 --> 39:26.446
- Give me your hat.
- It better fit when I come back.

39:39.168 --> 39:42.879
Now, Bert, stop playing around
and stop those horses.

39:43.130 --> 39:45.006
- Help!
- This is serious!

39:55.768 --> 39:58.686
- He'll be fine. He looks handy.
- He is?

40:10.324 --> 40:14.035
- Why don't you fix the wheel?
- The wheel is perfect.

40:14.328 --> 40:17.455
Then help him.
He'll kill you when he gets back.

40:17.665 --> 40:20.542
No, in the long run,
he'll thank me in his prayers.

40:35.683 --> 40:38.184
What's he doing back there?

41:08.382 --> 41:09.424
Sorry!

41:10.801 --> 41:13.887
- Stop fooling around!
- You poked me in the eye!

41:14.096 --> 41:16.556
Get up there and stop the horses!

41:17.224 --> 41:19.726
Horses! Stop!

41:37.119 --> 41:39.537
Stop!

42:22.623 --> 42:24.624
- Let me help you.
- I got it.

42:28.462 --> 42:30.171
Here.

42:32.591 --> 42:35.552
So, what's with the wheel?

42:35.803 --> 42:39.472
- Oh! It's fine.
- Nothing was wrong with it. It...

42:39.682 --> 42:42.308
I know. I got a real good...

42:42.601 --> 42:45.061
close look at the wheels
from underneath.

42:45.312 --> 42:48.273
Don't you feel better
about yourself for being so brave?

42:48.816 --> 42:51.651
- Wasn't that exciting?
- I get it.

42:51.944 --> 42:54.153
This was all for my benefit.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.656
- Yes!
- To help me build character.

42:56.949 --> 42:59.158
- Exactly.
- He's bursting with pride.

42:59.368 --> 43:03.288
That's funny.
You'd think I'd be mad, wouldn't you?

43:05.457 --> 43:06.916
Give me your hand.

43:07.084 --> 43:12.171
Don't you ever try
and help me again.

43:13.799 --> 43:15.091
You either.

43:15.342 --> 43:18.386
Now back off.
Go ahead, back off!

43:18.679 --> 43:20.096
Go away.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.016
Ungrateful.

43:39.617 --> 43:40.658
Help.

43:41.368 --> 43:42.869
What?

43:46.373 --> 43:47.999
Help.

43:54.214 --> 43:55.882
What did you say?

43:57.217 --> 43:58.343
Please help me.

43:58.552 --> 44:01.262
Oh! Okay, take my hand.

44:01.430 --> 44:03.640
You take my hand.

44:12.358 --> 44:13.900
Take my other hand.

44:16.278 --> 44:18.029
- Easy.
- Oh, watch the cactus!

44:18.238 --> 44:21.574
I don't care about it.
Just get me up there.

44:21.867 --> 44:23.368
You're doing good.

44:27.081 --> 44:29.749
Now get your hands off me!

44:34.463 --> 44:36.297
Ungrateful.

44:44.431 --> 44:49.268
Somebody ought to say
something nice about the deceased.

44:49.561 --> 44:52.230
How do we know he was nice?
We don't know anything about him.

44:52.439 --> 44:55.942
The only thing in his wallet
is names of whorehouses.

44:58.278 --> 45:03.866
Amazing grace

45:04.034 --> 45:08.621
How sweet the sound

45:08.789 --> 45:13.626
That saved a wretch

45:13.794 --> 45:16.713
Like me

45:35.983 --> 45:39.652
"Don't let Maverick reach the game."

45:54.626 --> 45:55.752
Trouble.

46:04.845 --> 46:06.846
Pull up!

46:22.321 --> 46:25.031
We sing praises
unto the Lord, our God!

46:36.919 --> 46:38.377
Here.

46:40.005 --> 46:42.215
We'll do everything we can.

46:42.424 --> 46:44.842
Though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

46:45.010 --> 46:46.886
Maverick!

46:47.054 --> 46:50.181
- They got hit by Indians.
- Yeah, they were Injuns.

46:50.390 --> 46:52.642
Ma'am, it was not Indians.

46:52.810 --> 46:55.728
I seen them.
They were wearing war paint...

46:55.896 --> 46:57.188
If it was Indians...

46:57.356 --> 47:00.191
I said we'd take them
to Cristal City.

47:00.609 --> 47:02.819
- That's backtracking.
- Just a day.

47:03.070 --> 47:06.906
- I have a game to get to.
- I know what you have to get to.

47:07.074 --> 47:10.034
- Took my girl's music box.
- My favorite!

47:10.202 --> 47:12.078
And the wagon with our money.

47:12.246 --> 47:15.915
Hold it. Simmer down. Simmer down.

47:16.083 --> 47:17.750
Exactly how much money?

47:17.960 --> 47:19.585
- What kind of animal are you?
- Vulture.

47:19.753 --> 47:21.504
Exactly how much money?

47:21.672 --> 47:23.047
Thirty thousand dollars.

47:23.215 --> 47:25.883
We were starting a mission.

47:26.093 --> 47:29.887
If I get it back,
is it worth 10 percent to you?

47:30.722 --> 47:32.473
Five. Five percent.

47:32.641 --> 47:37.061
No, 10 percent, Mary Margaret.
I want my wedding dress back...

47:37.229 --> 47:39.105
for when I find a husband.

47:40.274 --> 47:42.441
All right. Can you do it?

47:42.651 --> 47:46.946
- I know we can.
- What's this "we" stuff? Ma'am.

47:47.114 --> 47:51.659
I'll give you 10 percent,
but make those savages suffer.

47:51.827 --> 47:55.746
I'm telling you, there are
no hostile Indians around here.

48:01.628 --> 48:03.504
Oh, my God! Come on...

48:03.797 --> 48:06.757
Drums.
Those are definitely drums.

48:07.009 --> 48:09.385
Right again, Bert.

48:10.178 --> 48:12.513
It's Bret.

48:24.109 --> 48:27.612
- Well?
- They may look like dimples in dirt to you.

48:27.821 --> 48:32.825
But they're shod horse tracks. Indians don't
shoe their ponies. So it wasn't Indians.

48:33.118 --> 48:35.995
They're Indians.
They probably stole the ponies.

48:36.288 --> 48:39.498
- Not everybody's like you.
- What is it with you and Indians?

48:39.791 --> 48:44.670
Nothing. I try to shoot one a day. If
possible, before noon. How about you, Coop?

48:45.047 --> 48:49.634
It's their fault for being
on our land before we got here.

48:53.680 --> 48:56.515
- What are you doing here?
- We're partners. 50-50.

48:56.808 --> 48:59.310
Sounds like 50-50 to me.

49:00.437 --> 49:01.729
You want 50% too?

49:02.022 --> 49:04.023
I want those ladies
to get their money.

49:04.316 --> 49:08.194
Oh, fine!
I don't split my bounty with anybody.

49:08.445 --> 49:10.446
Would 60-40 be agreeable?

49:10.614 --> 49:14.533
- What'll you do for your 40 percent?
- I'll help.

49:18.664 --> 49:20.456
Oh.

49:24.586 --> 49:29.006
Seventy-thirty?

49:31.218 --> 49:34.053
Now, Mrs. Bransford, 70-30,
I don't know.

49:34.262 --> 49:37.223
You're not exactly
an experienced tracker.

49:37.724 --> 49:43.270
Some tracker you are,
following horses. Anybody can do that.

49:43.563 --> 49:44.897
Anybody? Oh...

49:45.065 --> 49:46.482
you see that hawk?

49:46.650 --> 49:49.610
- No!
- I won't shoot the hawk.

49:49.778 --> 49:53.364
- You know what that hawk means?
- What?

49:53.573 --> 49:55.741
Nothing. But you didn't know that.

49:55.909 --> 49:57.576
- I did!
- You didn't.

49:57.744 --> 49:59.745
Children!

50:00.747 --> 50:04.083
What?
Smell some Indians in Montana?

50:04.376 --> 50:07.920
No. Now be quiet.

50:08.088 --> 50:09.505
What is it?

50:15.095 --> 50:18.097
- What do you hear?
- Nothing.

50:18.306 --> 50:23.561
I thought I'd nap before sundown.
Sneak up on them in the dark.

50:27.899 --> 50:30.109
What are you laughing at?

50:41.830 --> 50:43.205
Here you go.

50:43.373 --> 50:45.708
There's 6 horses.
It's got to be them.

50:45.876 --> 50:48.669
- You got good eyes.
- We got to tie these up.

50:49.296 --> 50:52.173
Can you
teach me to be a better poker player?

50:52.466 --> 50:55.342
- What? Now?
- You might be dead later.

50:55.635 --> 50:58.637
You're all heart.
Poker's about observing.

50:58.847 --> 51:01.974
Observe the U.S. Cavalry brand
and the shoes.

51:02.267 --> 51:04.560
They're not Indian.
These are tells.

51:04.811 --> 51:06.103
- You got tells too.
- Do not.

51:06.313 --> 51:09.065
- You play with your hair at cards.
- I never...

51:09.316 --> 51:12.276
Would you two shut up?
Just listen!

51:13.820 --> 51:17.198
Sounds like a music box,
doesn't it?

51:20.619 --> 51:23.287
Oh, hey. There they are.

51:25.624 --> 51:27.958
There's the music box she talked about.

51:28.168 --> 51:30.669
And look at that fella in the back.

51:30.879 --> 51:33.339
He's wearing your sweetheart's
wedding dress, Mary Margaret.

51:33.507 --> 51:36.092
Margaret Mary. She's not...

51:36.343 --> 51:38.177
You're on a first-name basis.

51:38.470 --> 51:40.346
Would you two be quiet!

51:40.514 --> 51:42.306
Be quiet!

51:42.516 --> 51:44.058
You're crazy.

51:44.226 --> 51:47.186
Did you see any money over there?

51:48.605 --> 51:49.814
No.

51:50.315 --> 51:51.524
Can't see anything.

51:51.983 --> 51:54.860
We could take them easy.
They're half drunk...

51:55.028 --> 51:58.823
That's a strange new word in your
vocabulary, "we." This is your show.

51:59.032 --> 52:02.743
You'd just stand there
and let me face six guys with six guns?

52:02.911 --> 52:03.953
Yeah.

52:04.121 --> 52:07.623
I have one gun, that's six bullets.
They got six guns, that's 36 bullets.

52:07.874 --> 52:11.544
What if they got 2? That's 72 bullets.
Maybe they got rifles.

52:11.837 --> 52:14.839
Shut up. You're babbling.

52:15.048 --> 52:16.173
You're babbling.

52:16.383 --> 52:18.884
- No, I wasn't.
- You are babbling.

52:19.136 --> 52:21.053
Don't worry,
they're probably drunk.

52:21.221 --> 52:24.557
Coop faced nine men dead sober,
didn't you?

52:24.766 --> 52:26.225
He's always dead sober.

52:26.393 --> 52:28.394
- She didn't mean that.
- That's what she said.

52:28.645 --> 52:30.187
I said the outlaws were sober!

52:33.733 --> 52:35.359
Shut up!

52:40.157 --> 52:42.283
Here he comes.

53:01.595 --> 53:04.180
What if there's trouble? Seriously.

53:04.431 --> 53:07.892
- I'm right behind you.
- You are?

53:08.101 --> 53:09.935
No "wheels coming off" shit.

53:10.187 --> 53:13.272
That was broken bones.
This is dying.

53:13.607 --> 53:14.940
Other way.

53:15.108 --> 53:16.984
Dying. Right.

53:18.069 --> 53:19.653
- Give it to me.
- What?

53:19.821 --> 53:21.947
It may be my last chance.
Hand it over.

53:22.240 --> 53:24.909
- How dare you?
- I need all I can get.

53:25.118 --> 53:28.245
- No, just take your own.
- Got to be under there.

53:28.455 --> 53:30.956
- All right, 50 percent.
- Fifty percent?

53:31.208 --> 53:32.750
- No!
- Fifty-fifty.

53:33.126 --> 53:36.003
- No.
- Sixty-forty. Sixty-forty.

53:36.296 --> 53:38.422
- Sixty-forty.
- All right, 60-40.

53:38.840 --> 53:43.469
You're the fastest draw.
Why do you need my tiny gun?

53:43.720 --> 53:44.887
Who said that?

53:45.055 --> 53:47.264
It's true. I am fast, but...

53:47.474 --> 53:52.144
I can't hit shit, especially when
I aim at people, so I need bullets.

53:52.437 --> 53:54.230
- You back me up?
- Yeah.

53:54.481 --> 53:57.274
- Bert.
- Bret. My name is Bret.

53:57.484 --> 54:00.986
You're Annabelle, he's Coop.
It's like you're shooting me.

54:01.446 --> 54:03.656
Be careful, okay?

54:03.865 --> 54:06.492
Of course. You too.

54:36.022 --> 54:37.648
Hey, everyone.

54:38.858 --> 54:41.318
Wake up!
No need to get alarmed.

54:41.528 --> 54:44.655
I saw your fire and thought
I'd come visit for a while.

54:45.282 --> 54:46.532
Who are you?

54:46.700 --> 54:47.866
Bert Maverick.

54:49.786 --> 54:54.498
No. I'm Bret Maverick, and I'm here
to say each one of you has a gun...

54:54.708 --> 54:56.208
pointed at your heads.

54:59.212 --> 55:01.547
Just whistle, so they can hear you.

55:01.715 --> 55:02.881
You're surrounded.

55:09.889 --> 55:13.100
Did another wheel come off?
Clap if you can't whistle!

55:16.813 --> 55:18.731
See? They're out there.

55:19.232 --> 55:22.443
Marshal Zane Cooper will blow
your brains out. Probably heard of him.

55:22.736 --> 55:26.530
I know you're thinking he's old, decrepit,
gums his food and his women.

55:26.698 --> 55:28.407
But he can still shoot straight.

55:28.575 --> 55:30.784
After you is Ugly Annie Bransford.

55:30.952 --> 55:34.371
When she was born, she came out
backwards and no one noticed.

55:34.539 --> 55:38.751
Her parents had to tie a pork chop
to her so the dog would play with her.

55:39.044 --> 55:42.629
When making love, she has to pretend
she's somebody else.

55:46.092 --> 55:47.551
You're all right, Bart.

55:47.761 --> 55:49.470
Admit it. That was funny.

55:49.763 --> 55:51.263
I didn't think so.

55:51.431 --> 55:54.266
Well, some Indians
attacked a wagon train.

55:54.559 --> 55:58.270
They said it might be whites acting
like Indians, but I don't believe it.

55:58.480 --> 56:02.733
If you come along with me, we'll settle this matter.
We can all get some more sleep.

56:02.901 --> 56:05.361
So if you just follow me.
Get up.

56:05.528 --> 56:09.698
Get up. Get in a straight
line and let's go. Come on.

56:09.866 --> 56:11.575
I'll give you something to remember!

56:18.666 --> 56:22.795
- Aren't you helping him?
- A man could get killed like that.

56:32.472 --> 56:34.390
Did you just help him?

56:40.313 --> 56:41.814
Shot my whiskey bottle!

56:48.154 --> 56:49.488
My hand!

56:49.656 --> 56:51.115
Oh, that's my gun!

56:53.535 --> 56:55.494
Damn you!

57:00.542 --> 57:02.209
Oh, isn't he wonderful?

57:02.502 --> 57:03.544
Oh, yeah.

57:06.214 --> 57:07.506
Look at that!

57:07.715 --> 57:10.175
They're all gone.
Isn't it wonderful?

57:10.427 --> 57:13.011
- It's wonderful. I'll be rich!
- It was nothing, really.

57:13.304 --> 57:18.559
- I'll tell you what you did wrong.
- Now where's the money?

57:18.852 --> 57:21.019
You tell me where it is.

57:21.312 --> 57:22.563
There it is!

57:24.691 --> 57:27.860
I've never seen
such beautiful money!

57:28.069 --> 57:30.529
- Take off that dress!
- How dare you!

57:30.738 --> 57:32.865
- Not you. Him.
- Put that cash down!

57:33.074 --> 57:35.701
- I found it!
- I nearly got blown away!

57:35.952 --> 57:38.537
- I'll take the money.
- I'll count it for you.

57:38.746 --> 57:40.205
Don't let her touch it!

57:40.540 --> 57:43.709
Where are you going?
Stay and clean up your mess.

57:43.960 --> 57:46.378
Be mature. Clean up this mess.

57:46.588 --> 57:49.548
Get back!
Put those guns down and line up.

57:49.757 --> 57:52.384
Don't let her get
within 10 yards of that cash!

57:56.890 --> 58:00.726
I have found you.
For He said, "Seek and ye shall find."

58:00.894 --> 58:05.397
And I have found you. Oh, rejoice!

58:06.566 --> 58:10.903
Bless you for finding my wedding dress.
Now I can get married.

58:11.070 --> 58:14.031
The Lord says it's good
to bear children. The Lord says...

58:14.240 --> 58:16.074
- It's a beautiful dress.
- Thank you.

58:16.242 --> 58:17.701
I'm sure you'll find a husband.

58:17.869 --> 58:19.578
Two thousand five hundred...

58:19.746 --> 58:22.080
$2,600...

58:22.248 --> 58:23.499
$2,800...

58:23.666 --> 58:25.125
Two thousand seven hundred,
ma'am.

58:25.293 --> 58:27.085
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

58:27.253 --> 58:28.629
She'd know.

58:29.756 --> 58:33.509
Two thousand seven hundred,
2,800...

58:33.676 --> 58:35.052
900.

58:37.138 --> 58:41.808
Three thousand dollars.
Here you go, the 10 percent we promised.

58:45.647 --> 58:48.440
That leaves us
with $27,000, Margaret Mary.

58:48.650 --> 58:50.901
That's not enough to start a mission.

58:51.069 --> 58:54.279
Don't worry. We are honorable
women. We promised Mr. Maverick...

58:54.447 --> 58:58.784
$3,000 and we delivered.
The Lord will provide for us.

59:17.136 --> 59:18.804
My pappy used to say:

59:19.097 --> 59:24.476
"Never sneeze when you hide
or smile when you lie."

59:24.644 --> 59:26.478
And never,
under any circumstances...

59:26.646 --> 59:30.774
"...take money from women who've lost
a dog, a wedding dress and a wagon."

59:30.984 --> 59:32.943
Hallelujah!

59:33.111 --> 59:34.820
I lost a wedding dress! Bret!

59:38.324 --> 59:42.494
We have got
our money back. Saint Maverick!

59:42.829 --> 59:45.205
You owe me my 30 percent.

59:45.373 --> 59:50.002
I'm a man of my word.
You can have 30 percent of whatever I got.

59:52.505 --> 59:56.091
I hate to interrupt,
but I got a problem.

59:56.342 --> 59:59.011
If those renegades
weren't real Indians...

59:59.304 --> 01:00:01.471
who was beating those drums?

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:03.140
Maybe it was them.

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:24.995
I'll take care of this.

01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:36.673
Anybody get that?

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.926
You know about Indians.
Can you speak to him?

01:00:40.219 --> 01:00:42.220
I'll do my best.

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:02.908
What's he say?

01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:07.579
It seems
we've committed a terrible sin.

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:09.873
We're on sacred ground.

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:13.293
We didn't know that.
Can't you tell him?

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.087
Yeah.

01:01:29.977 --> 01:01:31.770
His gods demand a sacrifice.

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:34.439
There's no other way.
Sacred ground is sacred ground.

01:01:34.607 --> 01:01:36.066
Sacrifice?

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:38.402
Human.

01:01:57.130 --> 01:02:01.091
We can go if one of us
passes a bravery test...

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:02.634
but one of us must go with him.

01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:04.720
What's the bravery test?

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:10.934
He cuts off your hands.
If you don't make a sound, you pass.

01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:47.679
I'll die before I let him touch you.

01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:49.848
There's too many of them.
You can't protect me.

01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:53.518
You're right. Don't show fear.
It makes them crazy.

01:02:56.522 --> 01:02:59.024
One of us must go,
or there'll be bloodshed.

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:00.942
- I'll go.
- No, I'll go.

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:04.780
I owe you.
I almost got you killed twice.

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:09.367
I can't do what you can.
You get these people to safety.

01:03:09.535 --> 01:03:12.829
I'll go, but it's okay.
Third time lucky.

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:16.374
Oh, Bret.

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:21.004
I liked it just now
when you called me Bret.

01:03:22.381 --> 01:03:24.508
- One thing.
- What, Bret?

01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:28.678
When you bluff, never tap
your fingernails on your teeth.

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:31.181
That's your second giveaway.
You gotta work on that.

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:35.560
Even at a time like this,
you think of others.

01:03:55.206 --> 01:03:57.207
Goodbye, my lady.

01:04:01.879 --> 01:04:04.214
You were right, Coop.

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:07.342
I never felt better
than I do right now.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:10.220
Take care of yourself.

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:13.139
Now when they...

01:04:13.432 --> 01:04:16.434
Cut my hands off,
my lucky shirt'll fit.

01:04:19.772 --> 01:04:22.232
- Bye.
- Bye, Bret.

01:04:30.616 --> 01:04:33.451
What was
that about? My throat's killing me.

01:04:33.786 --> 01:04:35.912
- Tell you later.
- Tell me later.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:37.581
Bye.

01:04:37.748 --> 01:04:40.292
I could die happy right now.

01:05:05.526 --> 01:05:08.612
I'm just trying to...
Will you slow down?

01:05:08.779 --> 01:05:12.741
I can't get my... Where'd you get
this useless piece of junk?

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:16.661
I won it off a Russian guy in
a card game. Okay, okay. Watch out!

01:05:16.954 --> 01:05:18.788
My bicycle. Look at that.

01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:21.541
I'll stick with a horse.

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:23.960
What are they laughing at?

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:25.670
Nobody's ever ridden it before.

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:31.343
You sure do pick the spots.

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:33.511
Yeah, I know.

01:05:33.679 --> 01:05:36.765
Next time you people drive us off,
I'll find...

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:39.935
some swampland so awful
you'll leave us alone.

01:06:05.002 --> 01:06:07.087
- Is that good?
- Nah.

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:14.886
What's with the drums
and war paint and horses?

01:06:15.179 --> 01:06:17.472
We had a lousy year.

01:06:17.723 --> 01:06:22.060
Not much left to hunt. So when this
Russian archduke, where I got the bike...

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:25.981
came and wanted to see
the real West, I said, "Okay."

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:27.357
He pays well.

01:06:29.276 --> 01:06:33.363
We get dressed up in war paint
and whoop around like idiots.

01:06:33.572 --> 01:06:37.283
He wants me to speak like
they say in books, "How, white man."

01:06:37.576 --> 01:06:40.203
You people are such assholes.

01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:43.540
And he's got to hear
the war drums all the time!

01:06:43.749 --> 01:06:44.874
Gets on my nerves.

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:48.753
You'll move on, you'll have
the cash. What's eating you?

01:06:49.588 --> 01:06:52.424
- Bret.
- What?

01:06:52.633 --> 01:06:54.884
I don't have the $1,000 I owe you.

01:06:55.052 --> 01:06:57.387
Oh, I knew you'd say that.

01:06:57.555 --> 01:07:01.433
I'm sorry. You'll get it as soon
as I change my rubles into dollars.

01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:04.769
When will that be? I've got
a few days to make it to that big game.

01:07:05.062 --> 01:07:09.482
Oh, the big game, the big game. You need
$25,000 to get into that. You're crazy.

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:14.779
I know that.
I suppose I have to win the $3,000.

01:07:15.072 --> 01:07:17.782
If I get your $1,000 in time,
I'll only have to win $2,000.

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:19.701
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- What?

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:23.913
You've got $22,000?

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:26.791
Cash?

01:07:26.959 --> 01:07:28.293
It's not frog skins.

01:07:29.962 --> 01:07:31.921
I've never seen $22,000.

01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:34.966
I've never seen 25.
This is terrible!

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:37.052
Where is it? Can I see it?

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:38.970
Why not?

01:07:39.138 --> 01:07:41.097
- Can I touch it?
- You can roll in it.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.933
- Where is it?
- Where else?

01:07:45.936 --> 01:07:47.937
What is this stuff?

01:07:50.649 --> 01:07:53.526
- Oh, ha, ha, ha. Very funny.
- What?

01:07:55.696 --> 01:07:58.281
It's... It's newspaper.

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:06.081
- You all right? Was it the food?
- No, no, no!

01:08:06.332 --> 01:08:08.583
I'm gonna kill her.
I'm gonna kill her. Annabelle.

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.376
- What?
- Annabelle.

01:08:10.544 --> 01:08:14.297
How could she rob me of $22,000
when I was off to face my doom?

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.674
You were gonna cut my hands off,
she robbed me anyway!

01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:18.510
- What are you talking about?
- No decency!

01:08:18.676 --> 01:08:23.098
Pull yourself together!
Everyone's looking.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:26.725
I got your money.
I wanted to see how you'd react.

01:08:27.019 --> 01:08:28.685
I was just teasing you.

01:08:34.151 --> 01:08:37.319
Teasing? I don't like being teased.

01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:39.613
I'll kill you.
You'll be dead, I'll be happy.

01:08:39.865 --> 01:08:41.198
- Wait!
- What?

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:43.368
- Did you say dead?
- Yes.

01:08:45.496 --> 01:08:47.247
I just got an idea.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:22.948
Big asshole.

01:09:37.089 --> 01:09:38.631
How, white man!

01:09:38.799 --> 01:09:41.759
Hello, noble savage.
I've had a terrible day.

01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:45.596
I kill every animal in sight
and it's boring me.

01:09:45.805 --> 01:09:47.055
Boring?

01:09:47.224 --> 01:09:53.438
Maybe His Largeness be interested
in greatest Western thrill of all.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:55.523
What is it? What?

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.442
Come, come!

01:10:07.786 --> 01:10:10.622
What is greatest Western thrill?

01:10:12.416 --> 01:10:14.083
Kill Injun.

01:10:14.251 --> 01:10:15.960
Kill...?

01:10:16.128 --> 01:10:17.420
Is it legal?

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:22.342
White man been doing it for years,
but much wampum needed.

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:25.637
How much?

01:10:25.804 --> 01:10:29.015
One thousand.

01:10:29.433 --> 01:10:30.975
One thousand?

01:10:31.143 --> 01:10:34.020
Don't tie him.
That wouldn't be sporting.

01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:37.523
No, he'll lose, but easy hit.
Dying anyway.

01:10:37.691 --> 01:10:39.734
Smoke too much tobacco.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.071
Very sick. Put out of misery.
Deal?

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:44.948
Deal.

01:10:47.159 --> 01:10:49.994
Me go find
and give him courage.

01:10:50.162 --> 01:10:53.498
Indian law say death private thing.
You wait here.

01:11:00.005 --> 01:11:01.839
Psst! Hey!

01:11:02.841 --> 01:11:06.135
- Bret?
- Who else? Did you fix his gun?

01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:08.304
I couldn't.
He wouldn't let go of it.

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:10.807
Great
What's in it for me if I die?

01:11:11.016 --> 01:11:13.851
I got him up to $500.

01:11:14.019 --> 01:11:17.105
Five hundred? Worth the risk.
Let's get it over with.

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:18.856
Two-fifty a piece.

01:11:19.024 --> 01:11:22.026
I'm the one taking all the risk.
Why do you need $250?

01:11:24.029 --> 01:11:25.863
So, Arch!

01:11:26.073 --> 01:11:27.699
Look sick.

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:32.954
Tell him to run.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.998
No, no, no. Wrong!

01:11:35.207 --> 01:11:37.709
What's wrong?
I don't want to lose the light.

01:11:37.876 --> 01:11:42.839
Injun shot by white man's weapon
not reach Happy Hunting Ground.

01:11:43.048 --> 01:11:45.717
Injun die by Indian way.

01:11:45.884 --> 01:11:50.221
- I never used one of those.
- Psst!

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:52.473
Real easy, see?

01:12:11.577 --> 01:12:16.414
No wonder you people
were so easy to conquer. Give me it!

01:12:17.207 --> 01:12:18.541
Two thousand dollars.

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:21.210
Two thousand dollars?

01:12:21.378 --> 01:12:23.129
Two thousand. Give me that.
Two thousand.

01:12:27.217 --> 01:12:29.260
Come, come!

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:35.850
Oh, shit.

01:12:41.106 --> 01:12:44.484
I killed him. I killed him.

01:12:44.651 --> 01:12:45.943
I really killed him.

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:51.115
Are you just going to leave him
for the vultures?

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:57.830
Never liked him much anyway.
Come, we get the money now.

01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:09.384
Partner, we did it!

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:12.595
We did it. Yeah, "we" did it.

01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:14.764
You son of a bitch.
He could have killed me.

01:13:14.932 --> 01:13:19.310
- Arrows missing, bullets whiz...
- We had to make it look real.

01:13:19.603 --> 01:13:22.313
Real? You knew
he'd miss me by this much!

01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:24.190
- Shoot this.
- You shoot it.

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:25.983
You shoot it. I'll show you something.

01:13:26.276 --> 01:13:28.277
You go run.
I'll give you a 5-second start.

01:13:28.445 --> 01:13:31.155
- Hey, gratitude! I saved your life!
- What?

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:33.157
Shoot it. I'll show you.

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.707
- That's not funny.
- Hurts, doesn't it?

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.837
Anybody who uses my bow
can't use their hand for half a day.

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:52.677
And fresh from the mint.
All yours. You earned it.

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:55.430
I'd kiss you if there weren't
so many people.

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:57.348
Don't do that.

01:13:57.641 --> 01:14:00.518
So I guess you'll be going now.

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:03.855
How will I explain I got away...

01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:06.441
with my hands still attached?

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:10.445
Tell them you got us drunk
and escaped in the confusion.

01:14:10.696 --> 01:14:13.197
Nobody'll believe that.
It's stupid.

01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:17.869
You people believe anything.
Besides, that's not $500.

01:14:18.036 --> 01:14:22.248
- I got the big dunce up to $1,000.
- From $500 to $1,000?

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:26.002
- Who's the best?
- He would've gone for $2,000.

01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:28.337
No! That's pushing it, really.

01:14:28.505 --> 01:14:30.840
All I need now is another $2,000
and I'm in the game.

01:14:31.049 --> 01:14:32.508
With your luck, you'll win it soon.

01:14:32.676 --> 01:14:35.052
With my luck,
I'll lose this 1,000.

01:14:35.387 --> 01:14:37.763
- Hey, what's this?
- What?

01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:41.726
You insult me by counting it
in front of me? It's all there.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:47.690
I'm sorry Joseph, but lately,
even my close friends...

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.942
have stiffed me.

01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:52.862
Oh, hey, Mav!
What are friends for?

01:14:57.618 --> 01:14:59.577
Yeah. It's all there, isn't it?

01:15:05.292 --> 01:15:07.543
It was high time I hotfooted it
out of there...

01:15:07.753 --> 01:15:11.005
because I knew it wouldn't be long
before Joseph had a scheme...

01:15:11.256 --> 01:15:14.759
to help me reinvest
my newly-acquired thousand.

01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:21.265
Goodbye, Bert.

01:15:21.558 --> 01:15:24.435
The $2,000 wasn't the only thing
I was short on.

01:15:24.645 --> 01:15:27.271
I was really getting short on time.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.313
Hey!

01:16:13.652 --> 01:16:14.694
Hey!

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:27.999
Should've paid your cowhands
a little more.

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:30.543
Lucky for you,
I don't mind being made a fool of.

01:16:30.711 --> 01:16:32.878
I'd never let you make that poker game.

01:16:33.046 --> 01:16:36.299
But if you hadn't done
what you did, I might've let you live.

01:16:42.347 --> 01:16:44.181
But now I won't.

01:16:47.394 --> 01:16:51.856
It occurred to me, before I
blacked out, he might be teasing.

01:16:53.817 --> 01:16:55.318
And then again...

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:57.028
maybe not.

01:17:08.248 --> 01:17:09.624
All right, Lord.

01:17:10.667 --> 01:17:14.378
That's enough. I've... I've found humility.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:18.382
If you could get me out of this,
I don't mean to be...

01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:20.843
too presumptuous, but...

01:17:33.398 --> 01:17:36.150
Let's go! Go, Ollie, go!

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:39.278
Thank you, Lord.

01:17:39.571 --> 01:17:41.447
All right, Ollie.
You can stop now.

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:43.908
Ollie, you can stop.

01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:46.243
You can stop, Ollie.

01:17:46.536 --> 01:17:49.246
You can stop. Attaboy, attaboy.

01:18:14.398 --> 01:18:16.232
All right, Ollie.

01:18:19.486 --> 01:18:21.612
Don't go, Ollie. Please don't.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.073
Stay there, pal. Come on!

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:31.288
No! No, no. Don't run!

01:18:42.426 --> 01:18:43.801
Ollie!

01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:10.119
Bret! Bret!

01:19:10.287 --> 01:19:13.289
Bret Maverick. Look at you.

01:19:13.457 --> 01:19:16.292
- My hero's alive and well.
- You actually seem glad to see me.

01:19:16.501 --> 01:19:18.335
Well, I am.

01:19:18.545 --> 01:19:21.505
How ever did you escape
from those hostiles?

01:19:24.843 --> 01:19:27.970
I'm not exactly
a whole man anymore.

01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:50.826
Oh, Bret.
My beautiful, beautiful, perfect male.

01:19:51.161 --> 01:19:53.788
I don't want to seem forward, but...

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:56.916
I was wondering,
could you loan me $4,000?

01:19:57.083 --> 01:20:02.004
I've only broken even
at the poker tables these last few days.

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:04.882
That means you can't enter.

01:20:05.091 --> 01:20:09.220
Mrs. B., if it was within my power,
I'd give you that money in a heartbeat.

01:20:09.429 --> 01:20:11.722
The problem is,
I'm $2,000 short myself.

01:20:12.015 --> 01:20:15.392
And my poor, pure heart
was just set on it.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:19.396
This wine is for peasants!

01:20:23.902 --> 01:20:26.904
Set on this, Mrs. Bransford.

01:20:28.907 --> 01:20:32.952
Just stay as pure as you are
right now and I'll be back soon.

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:40.835
Hunting savages,
wasn't that dangerous?

01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:44.255
It's primitive,
but I like killing.

01:20:44.422 --> 01:20:46.841
Excuse me, sir,
could I have a word with you?

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:48.759
Do you know who I am?

01:20:49.052 --> 01:20:52.471
No, but I know who I am.
Maverick, Indian Affairs.

01:20:58.603 --> 01:21:02.106
It's over for you, Dukey.
Joseph talked.

01:21:02.274 --> 01:21:04.859
I know no one with that name.

01:21:05.026 --> 01:21:10.030
Funny. That's exactly what he said of you
when I started investigating the murder.

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:13.158
But once in jail,
he told the truth, and so will you.

01:21:13.451 --> 01:21:15.703
But I no American.

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:18.831
Murder's murder, Dukey.
You're looking at...

01:21:18.999 --> 01:21:21.959
a minimum of 10 years in jail
and a $6,000 fine.

01:21:22.168 --> 01:21:23.961
Six? Wait, wait! I have...

01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:26.171
six... Six... Six thousand.

01:21:26.464 --> 01:21:28.340
I have 6,000. Please help me.

01:21:28.508 --> 01:21:32.219
Do you know the penalty involved
in bribing someone from Indian Affairs?

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:36.557
No, please, I'm going home.
Please. Take the 6. Fix it. Please.

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:38.309
- Take, take!
- All right.

01:21:38.518 --> 01:21:41.478
The courts are overworked.
I'll give you a break.

01:21:42.606 --> 01:21:44.315
Don't shoot any more Indians.

01:21:44.524 --> 01:21:46.692
- All right?
- No, no.

01:21:52.824 --> 01:21:55.451
Excuse me,
has there been an accident?

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:59.038
Miss Annabelle, can I speak with you?
Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:02.666
- Good luck, Miss Annabelle.
- Gentlemen.

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:05.628
I got something to show you.

01:22:07.672 --> 01:22:09.298
Close your eyes, Annabelle.

01:22:13.053 --> 01:22:14.637
You're in the game!

01:22:14.846 --> 01:22:17.681
I'm in the game!

01:22:17.974 --> 01:22:20.684
- Best be quiet.
- Is there no end to your goodness?

01:22:20.852 --> 01:22:22.311
Apparently not.

01:22:23.063 --> 01:22:27.024
Heaven will kiss you for this one,
Mr. Maverick.

01:22:28.151 --> 01:22:30.319
I just realized something.

01:22:30.987 --> 01:22:32.196
What?

01:22:32.822 --> 01:22:34.698
You can't help it, can you?

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:38.702
You are irresistible.

01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:48.045
If by some small chance you happen
to win, I'll expect my 50 percent.

01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:51.882
Then I'll be expecting
50 percent of your winnings.

01:22:52.717 --> 01:22:55.552
Perhaps we should
consider that a loan.

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:28.377
Let him go!

01:23:34.592 --> 01:23:36.802
How'd you get here? Tell me!

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:39.054
No, you tell me...

01:23:39.556 --> 01:23:42.891
what did you mean when you said
you'd never let me make it to this game?

01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:45.561
Who's trying to stop me?

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:48.856
It's gonna be a pleasure
playing you again.

01:23:49.482 --> 01:23:51.734
The pleasure's all yours.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.527
Come on.

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.496
All right, all right!

01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:08.042
All right, come on.

01:24:10.795 --> 01:24:12.171
Hey!

01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:14.298
My, my, my.

01:24:19.679 --> 01:24:20.971
Hit it!

01:24:25.101 --> 01:24:28.771
Welcome to my ship,
the Lauren Belle.

01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:31.815
And welcome to the first annual...

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:34.234
All River's
Draw Poker Championship.

01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:40.282
Rules are simple.

01:24:40.492 --> 01:24:43.160
We play till we drop.
Winner takes all.

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:45.829
The dealer can call one break
of one hour.

01:24:45.997 --> 01:24:47.664
As soon as you're busted, you're gone.

01:24:49.834 --> 01:24:53.587
Twenty of us playing, which means
there's going to be 19 broken hearts.

01:24:55.507 --> 01:24:57.800
Let's make it a great contest.

01:24:58.009 --> 01:25:00.677
An honest, great contest.

01:25:00.845 --> 01:25:02.137
For that reason...

01:25:02.305 --> 01:25:06.683
I've imported one of the West's
most remarkable lawmen.

01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:08.644
Marshal Zane Cooper.

01:25:08.812 --> 01:25:10.270
He'll show us how to run things.

01:25:12.816 --> 01:25:16.151
Come on up here, Coop.
Tell us how you're gonna do it.

01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:22.032
Thank you, Commodore Duvall.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.910
Now players,
anyone caught cheating...

01:25:25.203 --> 01:25:28.205
will forfeit his entry fee
and be banned.

01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:30.207
See these?

01:25:30.834 --> 01:25:35.045
They're the only two allowed here.
Anyone breaking rules...

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:38.465
better be a faster draw than me.
And better learn how to swim.

01:25:45.265 --> 01:25:46.723
Thank you, sir.

01:25:49.269 --> 01:25:51.019
- Commodore.
- All right, gamblers...

01:25:51.187 --> 01:25:53.981
step right up
and bring your money.

01:25:55.567 --> 01:25:57.568
After you.

01:25:58.528 --> 01:25:59.945
Twenty-five thousand dollars.

01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:01.572
That's correct. Here.

01:26:01.739 --> 01:26:03.574
Make your mark right here.

01:26:04.742 --> 01:26:06.326
Thank you, sir.

01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:09.079
Put in the money
and make your mark, gentlemen.

01:26:09.247 --> 01:26:11.039
Good luck to you.

01:26:11.207 --> 01:26:12.916
There it is.

01:26:13.084 --> 01:26:15.002
I'll take good care of it.

01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:19.173
Count that, would you?

01:26:19.883 --> 01:26:22.759
- It's all there.
- I'm sure it is.

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:37.065
The games will begin in 10 minutes.

01:26:39.068 --> 01:26:44.323
Ladies and gentlemen, if we had
$25,000 more, we'd have a half-million.

01:26:44.616 --> 01:26:47.326
- We're minus one entry fee.
- What?

01:26:47.493 --> 01:26:49.286
I believe it's yours.

01:26:56.336 --> 01:26:58.712
Do I need to count it?

01:27:00.632 --> 01:27:02.424
I don't think so.

01:27:03.426 --> 01:27:05.636
Even half-million.

01:27:07.597 --> 01:27:10.974
This safe was brought in
specially for this contest.

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:15.520
I selected the combination.
I'm the only one that knows it.

01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:19.650
Commodore, the money's as protected
as I can make it.

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:22.945
There it is. Gamblers...

01:27:23.154 --> 01:27:27.115
find your designated table
and let's play some poker!

01:27:57.855 --> 01:27:59.398
Four aces.

01:28:29.345 --> 01:28:30.721
Five thousand.

01:28:47.905 --> 01:28:49.740
Mr. Maverick wins the pot.

01:28:57.373 --> 01:28:59.249
Dumb ass.

01:29:04.422 --> 01:29:05.756
I'll call you.

01:29:06.758 --> 01:29:08.091
Gentlemen...

01:29:08.259 --> 01:29:09.885
four kings.

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:14.473
All right, young man. Let's go.

01:29:14.766 --> 01:29:17.642
Hey! A cheater!

01:29:17.935 --> 01:29:19.561
You cheating son of a bitch!

01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:21.938
Sit down! I'll handle this.

01:29:22.148 --> 01:29:23.940
I knew it was him!

01:29:24.108 --> 01:29:25.734
Don't touch my chips!

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:38.789
Hang on a second.
Hang on a second!

01:29:38.956 --> 01:29:40.957
Where are you taking me?

01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:43.877
I can't swim!

01:29:50.093 --> 01:29:51.927
Gentlemen, my pleasure.

01:29:59.811 --> 01:30:02.604
Kings over tens, gentlemen.

01:30:03.481 --> 01:30:04.940
Ripped my shirt!

01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:09.319
Time to go for a swim.
Divide the chips among the players.

01:30:09.654 --> 01:30:11.154
You son of a bitch!

01:30:13.533 --> 01:30:15.158
Sorry, old-timer, that's it.

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:24.751
- Sir.
- If you don't mind.

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:28.213
- At your pleasure.
- Thank you, Mr. Coop.

01:30:40.351 --> 01:30:41.852
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:54.698
- Good game, Hightower.
- Hightower retires.

01:30:57.243 --> 01:30:58.702
Oh.

01:31:06.210 --> 01:31:07.794
Four queens.

01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:15.469
Congratulations.

01:31:15.636 --> 01:31:19.973
Chips'll be waiting at the main table.
Good luck in the final game.

01:31:25.271 --> 01:31:26.563
Full house, kings over ace.

01:31:26.856 --> 01:31:30.233
That's a good hand.
That beats one...

01:31:30.401 --> 01:31:31.902
two...

01:31:32.069 --> 01:31:33.987
three sevens.

01:31:34.739 --> 01:31:36.239
But not four.

01:31:36.407 --> 01:31:37.657
What?

01:31:40.411 --> 01:31:42.746
I didn't...

01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:45.081
Sir, why don't we go get a drink?

01:31:45.291 --> 01:31:48.585
Get some fresh air.
You'll feel better if you get fresh air.

01:31:48.753 --> 01:31:50.795
There we go. Watch your step.

01:31:57.303 --> 01:32:02.057
- I hate those sad losers.
- Don't play if you can't afford it.

01:32:02.266 --> 01:32:03.642
How's it look?

01:32:03.935 --> 01:32:06.853
It looks like you,
Mrs. Bransford, the Spaniard...

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:10.524
and, unless a miracle happens,
Maverick.

01:32:10.691 --> 01:32:12.817
Maverick?

01:32:12.985 --> 01:32:16.571
When it's decided,
call a break for an hour...

01:32:19.617 --> 01:32:22.118
and let's set it up at that table.

01:32:23.329 --> 01:32:26.540
I was going to leave you
something, but I'm cleaned out.

01:32:26.791 --> 01:32:28.792
You're a hell of a player.

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.586
Ma'am, that's the most I ever
enjoyed losing.

01:32:36.425 --> 01:32:39.261
- A thousand for you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:45.225
Congratulations. I'll see that your chips
are set up for the next game.

01:33:21.971 --> 01:33:24.222
Good luck to you, son.

01:33:25.641 --> 01:33:30.145
Leave your chips here, I'll make sure
they're transferred for the final game.

01:33:30.896 --> 01:33:32.647
Congratulations.

01:33:42.116 --> 01:33:44.909
The players can take
a one-hour break.

01:33:45.202 --> 01:33:49.831
Anyone not back in their seat at
the stroke of 5 forfeits their winnings.

01:34:04.930 --> 01:34:07.515
- Annabelle.
- Bret.

01:34:07.683 --> 01:34:09.726
Annabelle

01:34:10.061 --> 01:34:12.062
I thought you were...

01:34:12.271 --> 01:34:13.897
Good morning.

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:24.699
Sorry.

01:34:58.067 --> 01:35:00.610
Thirty minutes, everybody.

01:35:01.195 --> 01:35:03.613
Thirty minutes to the final game.

01:35:10.996 --> 01:35:13.415
He's a good four minutes fast.

01:35:13.582 --> 01:35:14.916
30 minutes...

01:35:17.336 --> 01:35:18.795
Positions, sir?

01:35:19.088 --> 01:35:21.715
Dealer over there.
Give me the cards.

01:35:25.928 --> 01:35:28.138
Fifteen minutes, everybody.

01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:32.517
- Fifteen minutes.
- Maybe we better get serious.

01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:34.978
Here.

01:35:35.312 --> 01:35:36.813
I got it, if you don't mind.

01:35:36.981 --> 01:35:39.899
Madam, we have rules
about that on board ship.

01:35:40.067 --> 01:35:41.317
That's my gun.

01:35:41.485 --> 01:35:43.236
- It's your gun?
- Yeah, it's mine.

01:35:43.404 --> 01:35:44.654
Do you swim?

01:35:44.822 --> 01:35:47.741
Swim? No.
But she does and it's her gun.

01:35:47.908 --> 01:35:49.367
And this one?

01:35:49.535 --> 01:35:51.411
- Is this hers too?
- I'm carrying it for her.

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:53.830
- What?
- Madam, is this your husband?

01:35:53.998 --> 01:35:56.583
- How about a little boat?
- A little boat?

01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:34.204
Well, you look particularly
ravishing for 5 in the morning.

01:36:34.413 --> 01:36:37.874
Nice glow about you.
Five minutes, Mr. Maverick!

01:36:44.882 --> 01:36:48.760
Four minutes!
Four minutes to game time, folks!

01:37:34.056 --> 01:37:35.515
Dealer...

01:37:35.683 --> 01:37:38.059
start dividing up Maverick's chips.

01:37:38.227 --> 01:37:40.728
- Looks like he's a no-show.
- Yes, sir.

01:38:14.763 --> 01:38:16.556
Wait!

01:38:18.475 --> 01:38:19.809
Excuse me.

01:38:32.698 --> 01:38:35.617
Dealer, you can start the game.

01:38:35.784 --> 01:38:38.036
Ante up, everyone, 50 dollars.

01:38:50.841 --> 01:38:53.509
A thousand and two more.

01:38:55.304 --> 01:38:59.140
I'll see your 2,000 and...

01:38:59.308 --> 01:39:01.434
Can I bid everything I have left?

01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:03.478
Yes, ma'am.

01:39:04.730 --> 01:39:06.981
That'll be $12,000.

01:39:10.736 --> 01:39:13.821
- Too rich for my blood.
- I'm out.

01:39:17.826 --> 01:39:20.954
What the hell.
I feel like being silly. I'll call.

01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:28.586
It's just a pair of sixes.

01:39:28.754 --> 01:39:31.881
If you can beat that,
you got me licked.

01:39:32.049 --> 01:39:34.968
That's not a totally unpleasant prospect.

01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:44.060
I'm out of the game.

01:39:44.353 --> 01:39:46.396
You put me out of the game.

01:39:46.563 --> 01:39:47.897
Yes, I did.

01:39:48.065 --> 01:39:49.857
I didn't do any of my tells.

01:39:50.025 --> 01:39:52.026
I didn't twirl my hair
or flick my teeth.

01:39:54.238 --> 01:39:56.280
You held your breath.

01:39:56.448 --> 01:39:58.574
No, I wasn't.

01:39:59.493 --> 01:40:01.661
- Did I hold my breath?
- Yes.

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:03.413
Did I hold my breath?

01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:04.872
Did I?

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:06.666
See?

01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:09.502
Sorry. See, usually...

01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:12.547
when you get excited,
you breathe heavily.

01:40:12.715 --> 01:40:16.009
How do you? Oh.

01:40:20.014 --> 01:40:24.726
I'll just pretend I was playing
with somebody else's money.

01:40:24.893 --> 01:40:28.021
- Shouldn't be hard.
- Gentlemen.

01:40:30.399 --> 01:40:32.942
You did hold your breath.

01:40:33.152 --> 01:40:34.694
Ante up.

01:41:43.597 --> 01:41:46.099
It's up to you, commodore, to open.

01:41:46.266 --> 01:41:47.892
I'll open for 5,000.

01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:50.520
Five thousand?

01:41:52.356 --> 01:41:54.649
I'll see your 5...

01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:56.984
and raise you 5.

01:41:57.152 --> 01:41:58.611
Ten thousand to you, Mr. Maverick.

01:41:58.779 --> 01:42:00.446
Call.

01:42:00.614 --> 01:42:03.533
And 5 more to me.

01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:06.994
Cards, gentlemen.

01:42:07.162 --> 01:42:09.497
Two cards, please.

01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:15.336
- Sir?
- Two.

01:42:50.539 --> 01:42:52.582
Mr. Maverick.

01:42:53.083 --> 01:42:56.419
One card, but not from you.
Put the deck down.

01:42:57.171 --> 01:42:58.921
What?

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.758
I'd like a new deck,
new cut and a new shuffle.

01:43:02.926 --> 01:43:05.094
I'm sorry, that isn't permitted.

01:43:05.262 --> 01:43:07.471
You can have a new dealer if you'd like,
but that's it.

01:43:10.392 --> 01:43:14.061
In that case,
I'd like you to deal.

01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:18.316
- Me?
- Just one from the top would be sufficient.

01:43:18.942 --> 01:43:21.110
I like that.

01:43:21.278 --> 01:43:23.112
Shows trust.

01:43:37.294 --> 01:43:41.297
The commodore has four of a kind,
Angel has a small straight flush...

01:43:41.506 --> 01:43:43.925
and I don't have the least idea
what Maverick has.

01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:48.554
It's up to you, commodore.

01:43:49.973 --> 01:43:55.478
Since it looks like I'm sucking hind tit,
I think I'll just bet my whole tray.

01:43:55.646 --> 01:43:58.314
The Commodore wagers $25,000.

01:44:07.032 --> 01:44:09.450
I'll see your 25.

01:44:12.037 --> 01:44:13.829
I guess we're even.

01:44:16.124 --> 01:44:19.627
I'll raise you everything I've got.

01:44:23.006 --> 01:44:26.050
That's half a million dollars
to the winner.

01:44:33.976 --> 01:44:36.102
That should cover the commodore.

01:44:37.854 --> 01:44:39.981
Aren't you gonna look at your card?

01:44:40.148 --> 01:44:41.565
No need.

01:44:41.733 --> 01:44:45.027
What are you playing at?
Look at it.

01:44:45.195 --> 01:44:47.780
I'd look at my card if I were you.

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:51.450
This is your portion of the pot.

01:44:51.618 --> 01:44:55.705
What kind of poker you playing?
Look at that card!

01:44:59.501 --> 01:45:02.837
Cards have been called, commodore.
Show your cards.

01:45:06.675 --> 01:45:08.843
I have two small pair.

01:45:11.555 --> 01:45:13.306
Eights...

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:15.391
and eights.

01:45:22.399 --> 01:45:23.816
Thank you.

01:45:30.824 --> 01:45:32.992
You're not gonna look at your card?

01:45:39.583 --> 01:45:41.542
Well...

01:45:43.754 --> 01:45:47.256
how you gonna know
if you can beat my straight flush?

01:45:56.683 --> 01:45:57.975
Unbeatable!

01:46:06.651 --> 01:46:08.444
Ten of spades.

01:46:08.612 --> 01:46:10.237
Jack of spades.

01:46:10.781 --> 01:46:15.117
Queen of spades
and king of spades.

01:46:15.285 --> 01:46:16.619
A possible royal flush.

01:46:19.956 --> 01:46:21.791
Quiet! Quiet!

01:47:22.519 --> 01:47:24.645
You beat him.

01:47:24.813 --> 01:47:28.149
You miserable, cheating son of a bitch!

01:47:52.716 --> 01:47:54.216
You all right?

01:47:54.551 --> 01:47:56.552
I can't believe
I pulled that card. I...

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:59.263
Did I ever tell you how I was in the desert?
The snakes...

01:47:59.431 --> 01:48:01.098
You're babbling.

01:48:01.266 --> 01:48:03.100
You're babbling.

01:48:04.728 --> 01:48:06.896
Your security isn't worth a damn!

01:48:07.063 --> 01:48:09.064
Everybody's got a gun!

01:48:24.206 --> 01:48:25.664
Ladies and gents...

01:48:25.832 --> 01:48:30.085
for our presentation of one-half
million dollars to our winner...

01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:32.087
Mr. Maverick!

01:48:37.719 --> 01:48:42.431
I want to congratulate you
on a game well played.

01:48:42.766 --> 01:48:45.309
I wish your moment
could last longer...

01:48:45.477 --> 01:48:47.603
but I see all this money.
Hell, I just...

01:48:47.771 --> 01:48:49.271
got to take it.

01:48:49.439 --> 01:48:51.023
What?

01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:55.778
I'll have regrets, I'm sure,
but I'm going to take it nevertheless.

01:48:55.946 --> 01:48:57.780
Move down the steps.

01:49:00.784 --> 01:49:04.286
- Cut it out.
- This is no time to be brave, Bertie boy.

01:49:04.454 --> 01:49:06.914
Down the stairs, now.

01:49:07.123 --> 01:49:09.458
You too, commodore. Move it!

01:49:09.793 --> 01:49:12.336
- I'll take your bag.
- Get your hands off.

01:49:12.504 --> 01:49:15.756
Get away from here!
Down the stairs. Move!

01:49:16.132 --> 01:49:17.925
You sidewinding son of a bitch!

01:49:18.093 --> 01:49:20.970
I worked my ass off for that.
I'll be coming for it.

01:49:21.137 --> 01:49:22.805
I'll look for you.

01:49:22.973 --> 01:49:25.015
Look real hard! That's my money.

01:49:25.183 --> 01:49:26.976
Was your money.

01:49:28.645 --> 01:49:30.729
Do as he said!

01:49:33.108 --> 01:49:36.569
I don't want to see any faces
looking this way.

01:49:39.281 --> 01:49:40.698
- Captain!
- Yes, sir?

01:49:40.991 --> 01:49:42.950
- Get my gun.
- Yes, sir.

01:49:44.953 --> 01:49:46.620
He's headed for the lifeboat.

01:49:46.788 --> 01:49:48.789
- Try and stop him!
- Yes, sir.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.835
Out of my way!
I'll kill that son of a bitch.

01:49:53.003 --> 01:49:55.087
Go, go, go!

01:50:15.108 --> 01:50:16.525
There he is.

01:50:16.693 --> 01:50:18.193
Let him go!

01:50:18.361 --> 01:50:21.280
- Let him go?
- The man saved my life!

01:50:21.448 --> 01:50:23.198
I can always win more money.

01:50:23.491 --> 01:50:27.202
Anyway, I found out
what I came here for.

01:50:27.370 --> 01:50:32.082
Do I have to remind you
that's $500,000 that bastard's taking?

01:50:32.250 --> 01:50:35.753
And it grieves me,
but it's my half million.

01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:37.171
It's only money, right?

01:50:37.339 --> 01:50:40.007
Right!

01:50:40.175 --> 01:50:42.760
- Only money?
- It's not worth killing a man.

01:50:42.927 --> 01:50:44.553
No!

01:50:44.721 --> 01:50:47.681
I won't swear out
a warrant against him.

01:50:47.891 --> 01:50:50.559
Well, I'll be damned!

01:50:52.228 --> 01:50:54.396
I will be damned.

01:50:55.732 --> 01:50:57.608
Let's toast our champion.

01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:01.528
Our champion!

01:51:28.890 --> 01:51:30.641
Fiddle that Coop!

01:51:30.809 --> 01:51:32.184
Goodbye!

01:51:41.111 --> 01:51:42.569
Well...

01:51:44.114 --> 01:51:46.198
Oh, here.

01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:50.285
I meant to give you this.
I took it from you on the stage.

01:51:50.578 --> 01:51:53.080
You should have it.

01:51:53.248 --> 01:51:56.125
I meant to give you this cufflink...

01:51:56.334 --> 01:51:58.377
I took before you left
with the Indians.

01:51:58.545 --> 01:52:02.756
I been looking for it.
Yeah, I have. It's all right.

01:52:04.592 --> 01:52:05.926
Well...

01:52:08.012 --> 01:52:09.805
bye.

01:52:22.777 --> 01:52:27.156
You gonna miss me?

01:52:28.324 --> 01:52:31.118
You are gonna miss me.

01:52:32.746 --> 01:52:34.913
- How do you know?
- You were holding your breath.

01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:36.498
I was not.

01:52:40.170 --> 01:52:42.796
Maybe I was.

01:53:03.401 --> 01:53:05.277
Well, I...

01:53:06.404 --> 01:53:10.532
I guess I better go make my stage.

01:53:28.218 --> 01:53:30.761
See you in Abilene.

01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:34.848
New Orleans, wasn't it?

01:53:35.016 --> 01:53:37.267
Either.

01:54:16.224 --> 01:54:17.724
Where have you been?

01:54:19.894 --> 01:54:22.271
I had to say goodbye
to a lot of people.

01:54:22.438 --> 01:54:25.566
I didn't want them thinking
I was off to meet someone.

01:54:25.733 --> 01:54:29.903
And I did a lot of twists and turns
and backtracked a lot...

01:54:30.071 --> 01:54:33.240
to keep anyone from following me.

01:54:33.408 --> 01:54:35.492
I thought
we were in this together.

01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:39.371
You win, I do nothing.
Someone else wins, I do what I did.

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:42.165
You didn't tell me
Angel was in it too.

01:54:43.293 --> 01:54:45.669
Oh.

01:54:45.837 --> 01:54:48.463
If Angel had won,
we'd split it the same way.

01:54:48.631 --> 01:54:50.132
The reason I brought him in...

01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:54.011
I telegraphed him
to keep Maverick out of the game.

01:54:54.178 --> 01:54:56.138
He messed up on that.

01:54:56.389 --> 01:54:58.181
Poor, dead bastard.

01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:03.562
I don't like secrets.

01:55:03.730 --> 01:55:06.523
Yes, well, you're probably not gonna like
this one either.

01:55:06.941 --> 01:55:10.277
I don't know what it is,
I guess it's my greedy nature.

01:55:10.445 --> 01:55:12.779
But I've decided...

01:55:12.947 --> 01:55:15.532
not to share it with you.

01:55:25.627 --> 01:55:27.169
Uncock it.

01:55:34.344 --> 01:55:36.053
Sit down, gentlemen.

01:55:38.014 --> 01:55:39.848
Let's get real cozy.

01:55:40.224 --> 01:55:42.351
Parlay some.

01:55:46.022 --> 01:55:48.440
Put your hands down.
You look ridiculous.

01:55:51.527 --> 01:55:53.862
I admit, you had me fooled.

01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:56.114
Not many can.

01:55:56.282 --> 01:56:00.077
But you did save my life.
It wouldn't be neighborly to kill you.

01:56:00.244 --> 01:56:01.703
Besides...

01:56:01.955 --> 01:56:04.873
everybody knows
what you are now, anyway.

01:56:05.041 --> 01:56:07.960
All your life's work,
all the good you did...

01:56:08.127 --> 01:56:10.545
it's all been wiped away.

01:56:10.713 --> 01:56:12.673
Was it worth it?

01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:15.217
You got nothing to show for it.

01:56:17.011 --> 01:56:19.012
What you said is all true.

01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:22.182
I traded every decent thing I know
for that money.

01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:23.976
You can't leave me alive.

01:56:24.143 --> 01:56:25.644
I don't care where you go...

01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:27.688
one night you'll relax.

01:56:27.855 --> 01:56:29.398
Guess who'll be waiting.

01:56:33.653 --> 01:56:36.571
You couldn't
sneak up on a corpse, Coop.

01:56:36.739 --> 01:56:38.240
Not anymore.

01:56:38.408 --> 01:56:40.909
You're a decrepit old has-been.

01:56:41.703 --> 01:56:44.746
Well, what're you going to do?

01:56:44.914 --> 01:56:47.124
Maybe the fairest thing would be...

01:56:47.291 --> 01:56:49.418
let one of you kill the other.

01:56:51.421 --> 01:56:53.422
I'll let you decide which.

01:56:59.012 --> 01:57:00.429
Give me that!

01:57:03.224 --> 01:57:06.685
That, as they say, is that!

01:57:09.272 --> 01:57:11.106
Oh, shit!

01:57:17.113 --> 01:57:20.032
You dirty, rotten, double-crossed...

01:57:20.199 --> 01:57:23.285
I've never committed
a cold-blooded murder in my life.

01:57:27.415 --> 01:57:29.166
And I won't.

01:57:30.084 --> 01:57:32.544
Not till I find Maverick.

01:58:07.288 --> 01:58:10.791
Decrepit old has-been?
Couldn't sneak up on a corpse?

01:58:11.334 --> 01:58:14.836
You got $500,000 in that satchel
and your gun is 8 feet away.

01:58:15.088 --> 01:58:16.880
Not smart. Not smart at all.

01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:19.966
Guess not.

01:58:22.095 --> 01:58:24.429
It's plain to see
who won the toss-up.

01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:26.306
You shoot the commodore
in the back?

01:58:26.516 --> 01:58:27.808
No.

01:58:27.975 --> 01:58:29.518
Good idea, but no.

01:58:30.311 --> 01:58:33.021
I really enjoyed
nailing that bastard.

01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:35.524
No room in poker for cheats.

01:58:36.025 --> 01:58:39.945
He won't be able to touch a deck of cards
this side of the Mississippi.

01:58:40.196 --> 01:58:42.572
My old pappy used to say:

01:58:42.865 --> 01:58:47.202
"There is no more deeply moving
religious experience...

01:58:47.411 --> 01:58:49.204
than cheating a cheater."

01:58:49.413 --> 01:58:54.251
I never said that once.
You've misquoted me all your life.

01:58:54.418 --> 01:58:57.254
- Are we quibbling fine points?
- I'm sick of it!

01:59:02.844 --> 01:59:06.763
The things you said were so dumb
I had to improve on them.

01:59:07.056 --> 01:59:09.057
Dumb?

01:59:09.225 --> 01:59:11.393
Will you cut that out, Pappy!

01:59:11.602 --> 01:59:13.979
These are a buck apiece.
You taught me to save money.

01:59:14.230 --> 01:59:16.565
Really? Let me have one.

01:59:16.941 --> 01:59:19.234
- Yeah, those are the good ones.
- They are?

01:59:19.443 --> 01:59:21.069
You got a match?

01:59:31.581 --> 01:59:36.418
Bret, Coop, everything good?
Enough cigars, brandy, hot water?

01:59:36.627 --> 01:59:39.796
- Yell if you need anything.
- Yes, Mrs. D.

01:59:57.315 --> 02:00:00.066
I certainly hope
this shirt fits you.

02:00:00.234 --> 02:00:02.944
It's from the best
shirtmaker in San Francisco.

02:00:04.655 --> 02:00:06.114
Isn't she sweet?

02:00:06.407 --> 02:00:08.158
Hell of a shirt,
but she's robbing us.

02:00:08.451 --> 02:00:12.662
Look! Here's a lot of money
and your gun is 6 feet away.

02:00:12.955 --> 02:00:14.331
Eight.

02:00:14.624 --> 02:00:16.625
What a remarkable family.

02:00:17.043 --> 02:00:19.461
How'd she...?
How'd you figure that?

02:00:19.712 --> 02:00:22.297
You don't have
the exclusive on tells.

02:00:22.506 --> 02:00:26.218
You both have the same
height and build. You both...

02:00:26.469 --> 02:00:28.803
kiss the same way, you both...

02:00:29.013 --> 02:00:33.141
draw your guns alike and sing
the wrong words to "Amazing Grace."

02:00:33.643 --> 02:00:35.227
We do not.

02:00:40.983 --> 02:00:42.317
My! Such...

02:00:42.485 --> 02:00:45.153
splendid similarities.

02:00:47.865 --> 02:00:51.826
From the looks of things, the lady
better bring more hot water.

02:00:53.037 --> 02:00:54.329
Bye.

02:01:09.345 --> 02:01:11.888
Bret, son, you know
what we ended up with?

02:01:12.056 --> 02:01:13.515
What?

02:01:13.683 --> 02:01:16.518
A half-a-million-dollar silk shirt.

02:01:17.395 --> 02:01:20.730
Nope. We ended up with
a quarter-of-a-million-dollar silk shirt...

02:01:21.023 --> 02:01:23.858
because my old pappy used to say,
"Never put the cart..."

02:01:24.068 --> 02:01:27.821
No. "Don't count..." No.
"Don't put your eggs in one basket."

02:01:27.989 --> 02:01:29.698
Now that, I said.

02:01:30.533 --> 02:01:34.035
- So I have a boot for you.
- A boot?

02:01:36.038 --> 02:01:38.748
And the other one's twice as heavy.

02:01:40.918 --> 02:01:43.753
Bret, that's my boy.

02:01:44.088 --> 02:01:46.214
What are kids for?
I'd like the boot back, though.

02:01:46.382 --> 02:01:47.382
Be my guest.

02:01:47.550 --> 02:01:48.800
Thank you.

02:01:50.052 --> 02:01:53.263
I don't know why I left
the other half in the satchel.

02:01:53.431 --> 02:01:56.141
- I do.
- So do I.

02:01:56.392 --> 02:01:59.227
It'll be lots of fun getting it back.

02:02:00.396 --> 02:02:02.897
- Bret.
- Yes, sir?

02:02:03.524 --> 02:02:05.817
Something I got to know, son.

02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:12.324
How did you come up
with that ace of spades?

02:02:14.035 --> 02:02:15.285
You won't believe me.

02:02:15.661 --> 02:02:17.662
I'm your father, I'll believe you.

02:02:25.588 --> 02:02:26.921
Magic.

02:02:28.090 --> 02:02:29.424
Magic?

02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:32.635
Magic.

02:02:40.436 --> 02:02:41.978
I believe you.

02:02:43.689 --> 02:02:45.106
Thanks.
