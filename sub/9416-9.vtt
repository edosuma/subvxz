WEBVTT

00:06.875 --> 00:07.917
I know.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.625
Well, hang in there, honey, okay?

00:10.875 --> 00:11.875
Okay, bye-bye.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.083
I thought you were going to shave.

00:18.667 --> 00:19.667
What, are you kidding?

00:20.041 --> 00:22.375
I waited my whole life
for mutton chops to come back.

00:22.667 --> 00:25.041
These bad boys aren't going anywhere.

00:26.959 --> 00:28.458
I just got off the phone with Gabe.

00:28.542 --> 00:31.083
Apparently Gabe Junior
is quite a challenge.

00:31.333 --> 00:33.750
He even referred to him
as "The Devil Child".

00:34.667 --> 00:36.083
What goes around comes around, huh?

00:36.166 --> 00:37.875
Woo! Up top.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.125
Mom, Toby's not talking to me.

00:40.333 --> 00:42.208
- Toby, talk to Charlie.
- No way.

00:42.583 --> 00:45.834
- Toby...
- Hey, dad, chops are looking good.

00:45.917 --> 00:47.250
Oh, thanks, pal.

00:47.667 --> 00:50.583
You know, it took five tries,
but I finally got a kid to be nice to me.

00:52.083 --> 00:55.542
Toby's been giving me the
silent treatment for two days.

00:55.625 --> 00:57.583
- What'd you do?
- Nothing!

00:58.834 --> 01:00.041
Well, okay.

01:00.542 --> 01:02.625
I told some girl that he liked her.

01:02.792 --> 01:04.667
It's funny how,
whenever you say "nothing,"

01:04.750 --> 01:06.333
it's always followed by something.

01:07.583 --> 01:09.542
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

01:11.417 --> 01:13.208
Well, what am I gonna do about Toby?

01:13.542 --> 01:14.792
You know, I think that Teddy

01:14.875 --> 01:16.959
went through something like this
with Gabe once.

01:17.291 --> 01:19.333
Do you think she did
a video diary about it?

01:19.625 --> 01:22.125
I think she did a video
diary about everything.

01:28.792 --> 01:29.792
Hey, Gabe.

01:30.542 --> 01:32.917
Hi. Gabe Junior.

01:33.875 --> 01:36.750
You did what?
You tied your daddy to a chair?

01:38.792 --> 01:41.500
Honey, listen to me very carefully, okay?

01:42.041 --> 01:44.333
Do you know how to work a camera phone?

01:46.291 --> 01:47.125

02:58.041 --> 02:59.333
Hey, Charlie.

02:59.417 --> 03:02.542
Well, crazy week for the Duncan family.

03:02.625 --> 03:06.625
This is gonna be a long one,
so you might wanna get comfortable.

03:07.125 --> 03:09.583
Anyway, it all started a few days ago.

03:10.750 --> 03:11.834
Oh!

03:12.375 --> 03:14.667
Charlie, it's so sweet
you're playing with Toby.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.333
You're a really good big sister.

03:16.417 --> 03:17.667
No, I'm not.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
What do you mean?

03:20.083 --> 03:22.709
I got in trouble. This is my punishment.

03:24.834 --> 03:27.208
Well, you're still...

03:27.542 --> 03:29.625
A sister.

03:32.917 --> 03:35.417
- Hi, Lauren.
- Hi, Teddy. Is Gabe here?

03:35.500 --> 03:38.250
Uh, no. Do you want me
to give him a message?

03:38.375 --> 03:40.208
Yeah, could you tell him
I need to talk to him?

03:40.250 --> 03:41.500
It's about our relationship.

03:42.083 --> 03:43.542
Oh. Okay.

03:43.625 --> 03:45.709
Um, I'll have him call you.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.959
No, I really need to do this in person.

03:48.583 --> 03:49.709
All right.

03:49.792 --> 03:50.625
Thanks.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.917
- Uh-oh.
- What's wrong?

03:58.000 --> 04:01.750
Well, usually when a girl says
she needs to talk about the relationship,

04:01.834 --> 04:04.083
it means she doesn't like the boy anymore.

04:07.125 --> 04:09.959
We need to talk about our relationship.

04:13.458 --> 04:16.959
Meanwhile, there was some trouble
brewing in the neighborhood.

04:19.333 --> 04:20.917
We've got a problem.

04:23.166 --> 04:25.208
Well, come on in, Debbie.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.542
I came outside this morning
to find that some hooligan

04:29.625 --> 04:33.000
had rubbed soap all over my car windows.

04:33.166 --> 04:35.625
So I guess what I'm asking is...

04:35.709 --> 04:38.166
Where was Gabe last night?

04:39.333 --> 04:42.041
All right, it wasn't Gabe.
He's too old for that kind of stuff.

04:42.125 --> 04:44.125
No, besides, soap was never his thing.

04:44.208 --> 04:48.000
Eggs, water balloons, toilet paper,
that's really where he excelled.

04:48.709 --> 04:51.083
Well, whoever it was,
we need to catch him.

04:51.166 --> 04:55.083
Almost everyone on the block's
been hit by the mad soaper.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.709
You know what we need?
We need a neighborhood watch.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.375
Okay, so why don't we get
everybody together tonight?

05:01.458 --> 05:03.125
- We can do it here.
- Ooh, could I cater it?

05:03.208 --> 05:05.959
I've got some new ideas for appetizers.
I could wrap bacon around...

05:06.041 --> 05:07.458
Ooh, that sounds good.

05:09.542 --> 05:10.959
I'll go spread the word.

05:13.834 --> 05:14.792
Oh!

05:14.875 --> 05:16.583
My car got soaped.

05:16.667 --> 05:18.625
Where was Abe last night?

05:20.542 --> 05:22.166
It's Gabe.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.834
So... he's got a partner now, huh?

05:32.500 --> 05:33.625
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:33.709 --> 05:36.750
Oh, Gabe, Lauren stopped by.
She wants you to come over.

05:37.041 --> 05:38.667
- Oh, okay.
- Wait, hold on.

05:39.542 --> 05:43.834
Um, she said that she wants to talk to you
about your relationship.

05:44.625 --> 05:46.000
Hmm, okay.

05:46.083 --> 05:47.458
Hold on.

05:48.458 --> 05:50.875
Come sit with your sister.
We need to talk.

05:51.583 --> 05:52.458
All right...

05:53.083 --> 05:54.834
He said, slightly creeped out.

05:57.166 --> 05:59.875
Look, do you know what it means
when a girl says

05:59.959 --> 06:02.750
that she wants to talk to you
about the relationship?

06:02.834 --> 06:06.041
That... she wants to talk
about the relationship?

06:07.125 --> 06:09.542
No! Girls never say what they mean.

06:11.667 --> 06:12.625
So...

06:12.709 --> 06:15.291
- Are you saying what you mean right now?
- Gabe... just...

06:16.000 --> 06:17.709
Listen to me, okay?

06:17.792 --> 06:20.583
Most of the time when a girl says

06:20.667 --> 06:22.834
that she wants to talk
about the relationship.

06:23.625 --> 06:24.709
It means...

06:26.625 --> 06:28.875
Well, that she doesn't
want it to continue.

06:29.625 --> 06:32.250
You mean, she's gonna dump me?

06:32.792 --> 06:34.834
I kind of think so.

06:35.667 --> 06:37.250
Oh, man.

06:37.959 --> 06:39.875
I thought everything was going great.

06:39.959 --> 06:41.500
Guys always think that.

06:44.250 --> 06:45.834
I can't believe
I finally get a girlfriend,

06:45.917 --> 06:47.083
and now she's gonna dump me.

06:47.166 --> 06:48.834
I mean, I could be wrong.

06:48.917 --> 06:52.125
No, somebody who's been dumped
as many times as you knows the drill.

06:56.333 --> 06:59.083
- I can't believe this.
- Look, I know it's hard.

06:59.166 --> 07:01.375
But what does having a girlfriend
even mean at your age?

07:01.417 --> 07:04.583
All you guys do is go to the movies
and play video games.

07:04.667 --> 07:08.166
Great, so I'm devastated
and my relationship was meaningless.

07:10.375 --> 07:11.250
Come here.

07:15.875 --> 07:17.083
I know it hurts.

07:18.166 --> 07:19.458
Do you wanna cry?

07:20.458 --> 07:22.625
I didn't until you started hugging me.

07:28.291 --> 07:30.709
Welcome, everybody,
to the first-ever meeting

07:30.792 --> 07:33.458
of the Edgewood Drive neighborhood watch.

07:33.542 --> 07:34.542
Objection!

07:35.208 --> 07:39.667
I think it should be called the
"Edgewood Drive neighborhood patrol".

07:39.750 --> 07:41.250
Sounds more official.

07:43.041 --> 07:44.458
Are we gonna get T-shirts?

07:44.542 --> 07:46.333
And we're off to a great start.

07:47.417 --> 07:50.166
- Car's all clean, Mr. Doogan.
- Ah, thanks, Tommy.

07:50.417 --> 07:52.500
We've got to catch
whoever's soaping our cars.

07:52.583 --> 07:54.834
Yep, but first, we should
give 'em a nickname.

07:54.917 --> 07:57.667
Oh, I know, um...
how about "the mad soaper"?

07:58.834 --> 08:00.750
Wonder where she got that one.

08:02.250 --> 08:04.125
Is that all we're talking about?

08:04.208 --> 08:05.959
'Cause I park in my garage.

08:06.041 --> 08:08.792
Okay, but you care about
the rest of us, right?

08:09.041 --> 08:11.166
You people crack me up.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.458
- I'm out of here.
- Oh... uh...

08:15.542 --> 08:18.709
Before you go, Mrs. Dabney, crab puff?

08:19.500 --> 08:20.458
Don't mind if I do.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.500
Oh! Uh...

08:25.959 --> 08:27.250
I've got cats.

08:30.709 --> 08:36.166
Well, hope those kitty cats
enjoy the crab at $14 a pound.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.667
I have an idea.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.041
Go ahead, Mrs. Dobbs.

08:39.125 --> 08:44.166
I say we break into teams of two
and patrol the neighborhood after dark.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.375
What do you think, Bert?

08:46.834 --> 08:48.709
Well, I think that's a great idea.

08:48.792 --> 08:51.500
Yeah, I'd like someone young
who can stay up late.

08:51.583 --> 08:52.875
I'll take him.

08:52.959 --> 08:54.250
I'm just here catering.

08:54.333 --> 08:57.125
You're either with us
or you're against us.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.417
Oh! Hi, Gabe. You wanna come in?

09:09.500 --> 09:11.542
Uh, no. I wanna do this out here.

09:11.917 --> 09:12.792
Do what?

09:14.834 --> 09:16.333
I'm breaking up with you.

09:16.750 --> 09:17.750
How does that feel?

09:18.250 --> 09:19.250
Bad.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.583
Good, that's what I was going for.

09:23.959 --> 09:25.750
But I thought things were going so well.

09:25.834 --> 09:29.709
Really? All we do is play video games
and go to movies.

09:30.583 --> 09:32.458
I thought you liked
doing that stuff with me.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.041
Oh, please.

09:34.333 --> 09:36.041
"Hey, wait till you get to level two".

09:36.125 --> 09:37.333
I was faking it.

09:40.041 --> 09:41.709
I can't believe this is happening.

09:41.792 --> 09:44.041
What are you talking about?
You were going to break up with me.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.291
Where did you get that idea?

09:45.375 --> 09:47.291
You said you wanted to talk
about our relationship,

09:47.375 --> 09:48.375
I know what that means.

09:48.834 --> 09:51.709
I wanted to update my status
to "in a relationship".

09:52.083 --> 09:53.875
I was just gonna ask
if you were okay with that.

09:54.208 --> 09:56.041
But now I don't have to bother.

10:01.125 --> 10:02.500
Teddy!

10:04.542 --> 10:06.250
You ruined my life!

10:06.750 --> 10:08.500
Yeah, yeah, what'd I do now?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.125
No, not you. I meant Teddy.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.166
Oh! Proceed.

10:15.458 --> 10:18.917
You destroyed my relationship.
I'm never talking to you again.

10:21.458 --> 10:24.125
Get involved in a 14-year-old's romance?

10:24.208 --> 10:25.208
Yep.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.166
- Was that a good idea?
- Nope.

10:37.875 --> 10:40.250
Teddy: Well, Charlie, I thought
I'd given Gabe some good advice.

10:40.333 --> 10:43.250
But boy, was I ever wrong.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.500
Gabe was really mad.

10:46.792 --> 10:49.583
And he was serious
about not talking to me.

10:52.166 --> 10:53.041
Hey, Gabe.

10:53.792 --> 10:55.125
He's not talking to you.

10:57.375 --> 10:59.583
Gabe, I've apologized like five times.

10:59.667 --> 11:00.834
I don't know what else to do.

11:03.667 --> 11:04.709
Come on!

11:05.125 --> 11:07.333
What do you want me to do?
Curl up in a hole and die?

11:10.375 --> 11:12.000
He says, "that's fine".

11:14.125 --> 11:15.959
Man, just say something.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.250
At least, at least make fun of my outfit.

11:18.375 --> 11:20.834
Come on. I wore this
just to get a rise out of you.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.875
I can't say that.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.583
Ah, that's funny.

11:35.834 --> 11:36.834
What did he say?

11:37.041 --> 11:38.250
I forgot.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.166
Well, here I am.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.750
Oh, hey, Mrs. Dobbs.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.291
Welcome to neighborhood watch
command central.

11:53.834 --> 11:55.583
You mean your porch?

11:55.667 --> 11:56.542
Yeah.

11:57.583 --> 11:58.667
Okay.

11:59.125 --> 12:00.625
Let's get some eyes on the street.

12:02.542 --> 12:04.709
Wow. Sure is dark tonight.

12:05.750 --> 12:08.083
Might help if you take the lens caps off.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.417
Oh! Hey.

12:11.875 --> 12:12.959
Thanks, partner.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.792
Okay.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.583
Okay.

12:19.125 --> 12:20.709
Yeah, he's out there.

12:21.667 --> 12:24.458
I can feel it in my bones.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.750
Watch a lot of cop shows, do you?

12:29.417 --> 12:30.458
Ten four.

12:33.542 --> 12:35.500
Hey, you know something, Mrs. Dobbs?

12:37.667 --> 12:39.834
You and I have never
really had a chance to...

12:40.417 --> 12:42.166
sit down and get to know each other.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.709
Tell me about yourself.

12:43.959 --> 12:46.083
Well, I'm a widow.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.959
I don't like to stay up late.

12:48.542 --> 12:50.417
And this bench is uncomfortable.

12:51.750 --> 12:52.834
Good night.

13:03.750 --> 13:04.959
It's a nice car, Bert.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.041
I especially like the seat warmers.

13:07.417 --> 13:09.709
Oh. Those are on?

13:10.625 --> 13:13.250
Good. I thought I was having a hot flash.

13:15.208 --> 13:17.542
Nope. Your buns are just like mine.

13:17.625 --> 13:18.792
Warm and toasty.

13:21.417 --> 13:23.458
And now let's talk about anything else.

13:27.041 --> 13:29.959
You know, uh,
being out on patrol like this

13:30.041 --> 13:32.208
reminds me of my days in the service.

13:32.625 --> 13:33.458
You were in the Army?

13:33.542 --> 13:35.417
No! The Postal Service.

13:36.834 --> 13:38.959
Announcer: You're listening to KDOZ.

13:39.041 --> 13:41.875
KDOZ, mellow music for mellow people.

13:41.959 --> 13:44.041
We put the Z's in easy listening.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.750
You mind if I change the station?

13:47.458 --> 13:49.709
Only if you can find a better one.

13:51.750 --> 13:53.583
There is no better one.

13:57.375 --> 13:58.709
Think we should drive around a bit?

13:59.125 --> 14:00.792
Seems like a lot of trouble.

14:01.917 --> 14:03.250
You're right.

14:03.375 --> 14:04.709
Let's let the crime come to us.

14:07.625 --> 14:08.917
Mmm.

14:16.542 --> 14:20.125
So, uh, Deputy Doug
lets you use his patrol car?

14:20.208 --> 14:23.041
Deputy Doug doesn't
know anything about this.

14:23.709 --> 14:25.667
He's away for the weekend.

14:26.375 --> 14:29.291
- What if he finds out?
- Just more money for the swear jar.

14:30.917 --> 14:34.041
I gotta say, it's kinda exciting
riding around in a police car.

14:34.125 --> 14:35.083
Oh.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.750
Must be fun for you to
sit up front for a change.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.458
What's that supposed to mean?

14:43.542 --> 14:46.375
I'm just guessing you've
been arrested before.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.458
Because of your attitude.

14:50.667 --> 14:53.583
Okay, you know what?
That is highly offensive, Debbie.

14:53.667 --> 14:55.667
I have not been arrested.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.458
I was simply asked
if I'd like to take a ride downtown.

15:11.959 --> 15:14.750
- Hi.
- Hello, neighbor.

15:14.834 --> 15:17.625
- Well, you're in a good mood.
- Of course I am.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.750
Gabe and Lauren are broken up.

15:19.834 --> 15:21.500
The Devil Child is gone.

15:21.583 --> 15:22.959
This house is clean.

15:25.083 --> 15:26.834
Uh, look. The thing is,

15:27.125 --> 15:29.083
Gabe and Lauren broke up because of me.

15:29.166 --> 15:30.792
Give Mama a hug!

15:32.000 --> 15:33.750
Uh, can I talk to Lauren?

15:34.125 --> 15:35.166
Lauren?

15:35.250 --> 15:38.166
My favorite neighbor wants to see you.

15:39.208 --> 15:41.625
♪ Oh, when the saints go marching in ♪

15:41.709 --> 15:44.250
♪ Oh, when the saints go marching in ♪

15:44.333 --> 15:46.542
Hey, Lauren. Can we talk?

15:46.625 --> 15:47.583
Sure.

15:48.417 --> 15:49.417
Um...

15:50.333 --> 15:51.333
Listen...

15:52.250 --> 15:55.125
Gabe breaking up with you
was all my fault.

15:55.208 --> 15:57.583
I told him that you were gonna dump him,

15:57.667 --> 16:01.125
and so to avoid getting hurt,
he dumped you first.

16:01.667 --> 16:04.583
- Why would you tell him that?
- I was helping.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.583
- Was that a good idea?
- No.

16:09.750 --> 16:13.125
And so ever since you broke up,
Gabe's been devastated.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.834
Do you think you could give him
another chance?

16:16.917 --> 16:19.208
- Will you stay out of it?
- Absolutely.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Then...

16:21.417 --> 16:22.250
yes.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.083
♪ Oh, when the saints
Oh, when the saints ♪

16:24.166 --> 16:25.959
♪ Go marching in

16:26.041 --> 16:29.125
♪ Oh, when the saints go marching in ♪

16:29.208 --> 16:31.709
You know what?
Don't tell her until tomorrow,

16:31.792 --> 16:33.000
let her have tonight.

16:33.083 --> 16:36.125
♪ When the saints go marching in ♪

16:42.667 --> 16:46.000
- Man. Somebody got soaped.
- Whose car is this?

16:50.542 --> 16:52.834
Mom? Mrs. Dooley?

16:53.083 --> 16:54.625
You're the ones that have
been soaping the windows?

16:54.709 --> 16:56.583
Hey, Bert, wake up. We caught them.

16:57.792 --> 16:59.375
You didn't catch anything.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.959
You fell asleep in your car,
and that hooligan struck again.

17:03.375 --> 17:05.875
It's MJ's fault.
He was supposed to stay up.

17:05.959 --> 17:08.750
In this thing? Man, I don't know
how you stay up when you drive.

17:08.834 --> 17:10.125
Who says I do?

17:12.000 --> 17:15.625
- You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
- Completely irresponsible.

17:15.709 --> 17:18.500
Hey, check it out. A police car
rolling backward down the street.

17:18.583 --> 17:20.625
Oh! Smoking biscuits!

17:20.709 --> 17:23.333
I forgot to set the brake!

17:30.125 --> 17:32.959
Hey. You guys are back together.

17:33.041 --> 17:35.166
Oh, happy ending.

17:41.542 --> 17:43.208
Oh, come on.

17:43.291 --> 17:45.166
You're still not talking to me?

17:46.542 --> 17:48.709
Guys, everything is fixed.

17:53.208 --> 17:55.583
Actually, we decided
it would be better for our relationship

17:55.667 --> 17:57.125
to not talk to you.

17:58.417 --> 18:00.458
Besides, you've got bigger problems.

18:02.333 --> 18:03.875
You!

18:11.500 --> 18:12.792
Okay.

18:13.250 --> 18:17.083
So, last night's neighborhood watch
didn't go so well.

18:18.208 --> 18:19.625
My car got soaped.

18:19.709 --> 18:22.458
My rose bushes got run
over by a police car.

18:25.208 --> 18:28.917
Well, that will forever
remain a mystery, I guess.

18:31.250 --> 18:34.125
- Here are your keys, Mr. Doogan.
- Oh, thanks, Tommy.

18:34.208 --> 18:36.667
You're the only good thing
about this whole disaster.

18:38.125 --> 18:40.333
- See you, everybody.
- Not so fast, Tommy.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.709
Neighbors,
I think I just cracked this case.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.667
It's so simple a fool could solve it.

18:47.041 --> 18:48.208
And I did.

18:50.250 --> 18:53.125
Who is the one person
who's benefited from all this?

18:53.792 --> 18:57.417
The one who gets paid every
time the cars get soaped.

18:58.208 --> 18:59.083
That's right.

18:59.667 --> 19:01.458
The mad soaper is...

19:01.917 --> 19:03.458
Little Tommy Dixon!

19:05.208 --> 19:07.417
Actually, it was me.

19:07.500 --> 19:08.667
That was my next guess.

19:10.291 --> 19:11.667
Mrs. Dobbs?

19:12.166 --> 19:14.625
My stakeout partner?
Did not see this coming.

19:16.125 --> 19:17.500
I came up with the whole scheme

19:17.583 --> 19:20.709
because I wanted to spend time
with Bert Doogan.

19:22.542 --> 19:24.375
I was hoping
I could go on patrol with him.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.208
It would have worked too
if it hadn't been for PJ.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.125
No, no, it's DJ.

19:31.291 --> 19:33.625
It should have been me
napping in the car with Bert.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.750
So what do you think, Bert?

19:37.250 --> 19:38.375
You and Mrs. Dobbs?

19:42.000 --> 19:42.875
Can you cook?

19:43.792 --> 19:44.750
Yes.

19:44.834 --> 19:46.041
Okay. We're together.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.834
Well. That's it then.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.375
Crime's been solved.

19:52.458 --> 19:56.041
I guess there's really
only one thing left to say.

19:56.834 --> 19:59.000
Neighborhood watch... one.

19:59.083 --> 20:00.917
Criminal scum... zero.

20:03.375 --> 20:05.125
How long you been sitting on that one?

20:05.667 --> 20:06.542
Two days.

20:16.625 --> 20:18.083
Teddy: Anyway, Charlie,

20:18.166 --> 20:21.000
I'm really glad that Gabe and Lauren
are back together.

20:21.333 --> 20:25.000
But he's still not talking to me.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.959
Wait a minute. I just remembered,

20:28.041 --> 20:30.083
there's one thing
that always works on Gabe Duncan.

20:30.166 --> 20:32.000
Ever since he was a little kid.

20:33.417 --> 20:34.333
Tickling.

20:36.083 --> 20:37.125
Tickling.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.041
Why didn't I think of that?

20:40.041 --> 20:42.083
Oh, Toby?

20:47.250 --> 20:48.291
So...

20:48.375 --> 20:51.792
I guess now that he's 14,
tickling game is a bad idea.

20:56.333 --> 20:59.500
I really have to watch
these things to the very end.

21:01.250 --> 21:03.250
It's not over until she says...

21:03.375 --> 21:04.500
Good luck, Charlie.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.542
- Hi.
- Who are you?

21:14.500 --> 21:16.000
I'm you in the future.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.709
I've come back in a time machine.

21:17.959 --> 21:18.959
Okay.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.875
So, what do you think?

21:23.166 --> 21:24.208
You're pretty.

21:24.291 --> 21:25.333
Aren't we?

21:26.166 --> 21:27.583
Anything you wanna ask me?

21:28.041 --> 21:30.083
Did Toby move in with grandma?

21:30.542 --> 21:32.083
Still working on it.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.709
What's Gabe doing?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Eight to ten.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.458
What about mom?

21:39.542 --> 21:40.542
What about mom?

21:40.625 --> 21:42.333
Does it get any easier?

21:44.500 --> 21:45.875
I could lie and give you hope.

21:46.458 --> 21:47.417
But no.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.375
So what do you want?

21:49.458 --> 21:52.375
Nothing. I just wanted to try out
my new time machine.

21:52.458 --> 21:54.750
I'm off to go see some dinosaurs.
Wanna come?

21:55.041 --> 21:56.000
Okay.
