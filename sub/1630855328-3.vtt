00:04.853 --> 00:06.145
MAC:
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:06.179 --> 00:07.586
Guys, guys, guys,
guys, guys, guys.

00:07.620 --> 00:09.489
"Congratulations,
Paddy's Pub.

00:09.522 --> 00:11.226
"We are pleased to report that
we are interested in featuring

00:11.259 --> 00:14.299
"your bar on an upcoming
episode of our show.

00:14.332 --> 00:16.536
"We will be sending a producer
to do a walk-through soon.

00:16.570 --> 00:18.808
"Warmly, your friends at...

00:18.842 --> 00:19.910
Bar Rescue!"

00:19.944 --> 00:21.546
Yes! (chuckles)

00:21.580 --> 00:23.718
This is like our dreams
come true, right?

00:23.752 --> 00:25.722
What?
To be on a reality TV show?

00:25.756 --> 00:27.358
Yeah. Wh--
How did this happen?

00:27.392 --> 00:28.795
I've been writing them a letter
every week

00:28.828 --> 00:30.632
since the show first started.

00:30.666 --> 00:32.268
-Well, how long's it been?
-Too long.

00:32.302 --> 00:33.672
DEE: I very much do
want to be famous,

00:33.705 --> 00:35.207
but I don't know if I want to be
on a reality show

00:35.241 --> 00:36.678
where they try and make us
look like jerks.

00:36.711 --> 00:38.247
-Right.
-CHARLIE: Right.
Oh, right, yeah.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.549
'Cause, like, what
if they, like, edit it

00:39.583 --> 00:41.153
to, like, make me
look stupid or something?

00:41.186 --> 00:43.257
Yeah. This is a definite pass
for me. I'm out.

00:43.290 --> 00:44.326
This could be huge for us.

00:44.359 --> 00:45.929
What are you guys talking about?

00:45.962 --> 00:47.498
I'm a little disappointed
that you didn't tell me earlier

00:47.532 --> 00:48.500
because I would have been
working out

00:48.534 --> 00:49.737
for weeks in preparation.

00:49.770 --> 00:51.440
I mean, for God's sakes, man.

00:51.473 --> 00:52.943
What if, what if
my shirt falls off?

00:52.976 --> 00:54.914
Yeah, yeah. I'm a little off
my regimen, too.

00:54.947 --> 00:56.818
Like, I haven't even been doing
any of my...

00:56.851 --> 00:58.387
-workouts.
-Ever. He never has. Yeah.

00:58.420 --> 01:00.257
You guys are missing
the bigger picture here.

01:00.291 --> 01:02.863
I mean, wh-what are the odds
that they would pick our bar?

01:02.896 --> 01:05.167
This is a million-to-one shot,

01:05.201 --> 01:06.904
and I've got a really good
feeling about this, guys.

01:06.938 --> 01:09.209
Things are about to change
here at Paddy's Pub

01:09.242 --> 01:12.315
because our luck
just turned around.

01:12.348 --> 01:14.386
♪ ♪

01:37.733 --> 01:39.269
The second I clean it up,
you're making more crumbs.

01:39.302 --> 01:40.672
-Stop.
-There should be more crumbs.

01:40.706 --> 01:42.508
We should put crumbs
all over the goddamn bar.

01:42.542 --> 01:44.412
Sorry, but, Charlie, why am I
seeing so many silverfish?

01:44.446 --> 01:45.548
I-I don't know
where they're coming from, man.

01:45.581 --> 01:46.751
I cannot get rid of them.

01:46.784 --> 01:48.454
You should not get rid of them.

01:48.487 --> 01:50.524
Don't you guys understand
what Bar Rescue is?

01:50.558 --> 01:52.428
These are the exact
kind of things

01:52.462 --> 01:54.834
that John Taffer's gonna come in
and hand our asses to us about.

01:54.867 --> 01:56.637
-(sputters)
-DENNIS: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:56.671 --> 01:58.273
No, I don't-- I don't want
to have my ass handed to me.

01:58.307 --> 01:59.744
I mean,
how the bar comes across is

01:59.777 --> 02:01.881
-a reflection of
how I come across. Okay?
-Yes.

02:01.914 --> 02:03.250
And I, for one,
don't want to be known

02:03.283 --> 02:05.756
as a silverfish man. Okay?

02:05.789 --> 02:07.425
I want to look good
for the people watching

02:07.458 --> 02:09.496
in their...

02:09.529 --> 02:11.533
(stammering)

02:13.772 --> 02:15.976
Uh... What's the-the thing?

02:16.009 --> 02:17.780
The-the boxes
that-that people live in?

02:17.813 --> 02:19.282
You talking about their homes?

02:19.315 --> 02:21.486
Y-- uh, yes, yeah. Their homes.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.490
-(door opens)
-Jesus. I couldn't think of
that word. That's so weird.

02:23.524 --> 02:25.695
Guys, we have a problem.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.900
But whatever you do,
don't laugh.

02:29.002 --> 02:30.605
(laughter)

02:31.707 --> 02:33.645
-How are we not supposed
to laugh at that?
-I wouldn't laugh at that.

02:33.678 --> 02:35.047
This is not funny, all right?
It's not a joke.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.450
I don't know
what's going on with my face,

02:36.483 --> 02:37.719
but it's broken or something.

02:37.753 --> 02:38.988
-(laughter)
-MAC: It's very funny.

02:39.022 --> 02:40.424
-That's really funny.
-(groaning)

02:40.458 --> 02:41.961
-Ah!
-My egg's all bloody.

02:41.994 --> 02:43.998
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

02:44.032 --> 02:45.635
This is bad, dude.

02:45.669 --> 02:46.904
This is the kind of stuff
that starts happening

02:46.938 --> 02:48.608
when someone's
put a curse on you.

02:48.641 --> 02:50.377
-Curse? What are you
talking about?
-What?

02:50.411 --> 02:51.814
Let's just stop and think
for a second, okay?

02:51.848 --> 02:53.484
Like, Dee,
did you have any run-ins

02:53.517 --> 02:55.822
with anyone who might have
put a curse on you?

02:55.856 --> 02:58.327
I mean, I had
a tiny little issue

02:58.360 --> 02:59.797
with a neighbor last night.

02:59.830 --> 03:01.801
-(gunfire on TV)
-Yes!

03:01.834 --> 03:05.007
-(knocking)
-Spewing my hate
all over your teenage asses.

03:05.040 --> 03:08.347
What? (groans)

03:08.380 --> 03:10.919
Banging the goddamn door down.
What?

03:12.388 --> 03:13.758
Yeah.

03:13.792 --> 03:15.629
What? Why are you trying
to break my door down

03:15.662 --> 03:16.864
at 3:00 in the morning?

03:16.898 --> 03:18.534
I baked you some brownies.

03:18.567 --> 03:19.837
Why you baking me shit?

03:19.870 --> 03:21.741
-Trying to poison me?
-(scoffs) No.

03:21.774 --> 03:25.447
I just wanted to kindly ask if
you could keep the noise down.

03:25.481 --> 03:28.755
(chuckles):
Oh. Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

03:28.788 --> 03:30.491
I didn't realize.

03:30.524 --> 03:31.994
-That was really sweet of you...
-Oh, yeah.

03:32.028 --> 03:33.463
-...to bake these for me.
-Yeah.

03:33.497 --> 03:34.767
Hey,
I have something for you also.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.004
-Oh, it's so nice. What is it?
-Yeah.

03:37.038 --> 03:39.610
Well, it's a trophy. See?

03:39.643 --> 03:41.112
It says "Cunt of the Year."

03:41.146 --> 03:42.883
That's you.

03:45.589 --> 03:46.958
You are a nasty woman,

03:46.991 --> 03:50.364
and bad things are going
to happen to you one day.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.504
I guarantee it.

03:53.537 --> 03:54.572
Drop dead.

03:55.508 --> 03:57.946
Well, ther
e you go. It sounded
like that lady cursed you.

03:57.980 --> 04:00.819
I don't know. I call old ladies
cunts all the time. We all do.

04:00.852 --> 04:02.789
-Right.
-That's true.
-No, she brings up a good point.

04:02.823 --> 04:04.526
-We do. We do.
-I called an old lady
a cunt this morning.

04:04.559 --> 04:06.664
-See?
-Did you? Yeah.
-I sure did. I sure did.

04:06.697 --> 04:08.066
-No, I might've done it,
too, actually.
-Honestly,

04:08.100 --> 04:09.870
for me this raises
an even bigger concern.

04:09.904 --> 04:11.139
Okay. What's that?

04:11.172 --> 04:13.043
Dee had no right
to give that trophy away.

04:13.076 --> 04:14.947
-I mean, we worked very,
very hard on that.
-(Charlie groans)

04:14.980 --> 04:16.817
We did. It's not easy to make.

04:16.851 --> 04:18.420
-Nobody wanted to do it.
-Plus, she earned it, right?

04:18.453 --> 04:19.890
-Yeah, you earned it.
-And you earned it.

04:19.924 --> 04:21.627
And you're just gonna
give it away? I mean...

04:21.661 --> 04:23.631
Either way,
this is all bullshit anyway,

04:23.665 --> 04:25.936
because we're not having bad
luck, we're having good luck.

04:25.969 --> 04:27.371
What about my egg?

04:27.405 --> 04:29.042
You know what that
might've been?

04:29.075 --> 04:31.012
Y-You might've gotten cursed
when you killed that seabird.

04:31.046 --> 04:32.849
-What seabird?
-Oh, I didn't tell you guys
about this? Okay.

04:32.883 --> 04:35.154
So, the other day, uh, Frank's
making a banana daiquiri.

04:35.187 --> 04:37.458
Seagull flies
right into the bar.

04:37.491 --> 04:38.962
-Cheers.
-Yeah. Here you go.

04:38.995 --> 04:40.497
-It's tasty.
-(squawking)

04:41.466 --> 04:42.435
-Oh, shit.
-What?

04:42.468 --> 04:43.805
A seagull.

04:43.838 --> 04:44.974
Whoa.

04:45.007 --> 04:47.044
(squawking)

04:47.078 --> 04:49.082
Oh, a little birdie.

04:49.115 --> 04:51.553
Oh, what a sweet little birdie.

04:51.587 --> 04:54.559
You want some food?
Want some?

04:54.593 --> 04:56.096
-(seagull squawking)
-Whoa! Shit, Frank!

04:56.129 --> 04:58.567
-Die!
-Ah, Frank. Jesus.

04:58.601 --> 05:00.705
Come here, you rat, die!

05:00.739 --> 05:03.410
(grunting)

05:03.443 --> 05:05.180
Ah! Goddamn!

05:05.214 --> 05:08.453
And die, you fucking seagull.

05:08.487 --> 05:11.493
Bitch. Fucking cunt.

05:11.526 --> 05:14.198
Well, it's bad luck if a seabird
flies into a building.

05:14.232 --> 05:15.902
No, dude. It's bad luck
to kill a seabird.

05:15.936 --> 05:17.505
Every sailor knows that.

05:17.538 --> 05:18.741
I don't sail.

05:18.775 --> 05:19.877
Charlie,
will you stop trying to turn

05:19.910 --> 05:22.114
our good fortune
into bad fortune?

05:22.148 --> 05:24.753
All this doom and gloom.
Nobody is cursed.

05:24.787 --> 05:26.556
Oh, really, Mac?
Because I straight-up heard

05:26.591 --> 05:27.960
Cricket curse you yesterday.

05:29.195 --> 05:30.197
All right.
It's time to make good

05:30.230 --> 05:31.901
on your end of the bargain, Mac.

05:31.934 --> 05:33.203
What are you talking about?
I still need proof.

05:33.236 --> 05:35.107
Oh, come on, man.
Don't start with that.

05:35.140 --> 05:36.176
-We had...
-Cricket, what are you doing
in here, man?

05:36.209 --> 05:37.613
That's what I was just saying.

05:37.646 --> 05:39.182
Cricket, what are you doing
in here?

05:39.215 --> 05:40.952
What? What-what-- No,
we're-we're talking business.

05:40.986 --> 05:42.756
Business? I'm not doing
business with you, street trash.

05:42.789 --> 05:44.593
What is your deal, man?
What-what...

05:44.627 --> 05:46.029
One second you need me,
the next I'm a pile of garbage?

05:46.062 --> 05:48.000
-Is that what this is?
-Cricket, beat it, man...

05:48.033 --> 05:50.070
You better beat it, or I'm
gonna beat you with my shoe.

05:50.104 --> 05:51.139
-You know what?
-Get out of the bar, dude.

05:51.172 --> 05:52.174
You know what? Screw you guys.

05:52.208 --> 05:54.813
Oh. Hey, Mac.

05:54.847 --> 05:56.082
A curse on you.

05:57.084 --> 06:00.925
Vos omnes maledicti mille annis.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.900
I mean, he-he literally
cursed you, man.

06:04.933 --> 06:06.169
Now, guys, come on.
We got to take this seriously.

06:06.202 --> 06:08.173
Like, let's look at this.
Like, uh, Frank.

06:08.206 --> 06:09.877
Let-Let's do our homework
on sailors' curses.

06:09.910 --> 06:12.048
Dee, Mac,
go make your apologies.

06:12.081 --> 06:13.818
I will do nothing of the sort.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.154
In fact, I am done
listening to this.

06:15.187 --> 06:17.158
It's irritating, anti-God,

06:17.191 --> 06:21.066
and most importantly will not
make for good Bar Rescue banter.

06:21.099 --> 06:22.535
I am leaving.

06:22.568 --> 06:23.905
Come on, man!

06:23.938 --> 06:27.779
Charlie, how do you know
all this curse...

06:29.817 --> 06:31.252
-Stuff?
-Yeah.

06:31.286 --> 06:32.923
That-- I mean, look,
maybe it's real, maybe it's not.

06:32.956 --> 06:34.593
But, like, look at it this way.

06:34.626 --> 06:36.196
Like, i-if a black cat
crosses your path,

06:36.229 --> 06:37.899
do you spit
over your left shoulder?

06:37.933 --> 06:39.135
-Uh-uh.
-Why would I do that?

06:39.168 --> 06:40.137
-No.
-You guys don't do that one?

06:40.170 --> 06:41.707
I don't know what that is.

06:41.741 --> 06:43.143
Well, I mean, like,
when you're hopeful

06:43.176 --> 06:44.613
for something, though,
do you knock on wood?

06:44.646 --> 06:46.016
-Oh, that one. No. No.
-Nah... No.

06:46.049 --> 06:46.917
I've heard of that one,
but I don't do it.

06:46.951 --> 06:48.186
Well, do you make a wish

06:48.220 --> 06:49.890
when you blow out
a damn candle? I mean...

06:49.923 --> 06:51.894
-Of course we do.
-Yes.
-Ah, yes, that one I do.

06:51.927 --> 06:53.530
-You know
what I'm talking about.
-Candles, yeah, I like that.

06:53.563 --> 06:54.565
Well, 'cause I want my wishes
to come true.

06:54.600 --> 06:55.534
Okay. And why do you do it?

06:55.567 --> 06:56.604
You do it just in case.

06:56.637 --> 07:00.210
Just in case it's real, right?

07:00.244 --> 07:01.981
And "just in case" is
as good a reason

07:02.014 --> 07:03.183
to believe in anything as any.

07:04.152 --> 07:05.722
Hmm.

07:11.012 --> 07:12.057
I got to call a doctor
or something.

07:12.090 --> 07:13.326
Oh, no, you definitely should.

07:13.359 --> 07:14.788
I'm pretty sure you have
Bell's palsy.

07:14.821 --> 07:16.425
I, uh, I looked it up.

07:16.458 --> 07:17.460
But first you got to apologize
to your neighbor.

07:17.494 --> 07:20.533
Yeah. Just in case? Hmm?

07:20.566 --> 07:22.370
Just in ca-- No, no.

07:22.404 --> 07:23.939
I don't believe in
that bullshit. No.

07:23.973 --> 07:25.543
She's got the trophy.
I want to get the trophy back.

07:25.576 --> 07:27.246
You had no right
to give that to her.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.250
I swear to God,
if she doesn't have that thing,

07:29.284 --> 07:30.686
-I'm gonna paralyze
the other side of your face.
-Oh, okay.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.323
'Cause I want it.
Come on, that's-that's crazy.

07:32.357 --> 07:34.394
You-you have to be nominated
for that.

07:34.428 --> 07:35.963
(sighs)

07:35.997 --> 07:37.634
Hello, um, you don't know me,

07:37.667 --> 07:40.573
but I'm the brother
of this horrible woman,

07:40.606 --> 07:42.444
and she just wanted to come by
and tell you

07:42.477 --> 07:44.614
that she's very...

07:46.785 --> 07:48.756
Uh, she-she feels--
She, uh... (sighs)

07:48.789 --> 07:50.460
Oh, what's the word?

07:50.493 --> 07:51.762
(stammers) To make better
the feelings?

07:51.795 --> 07:54.634
-"Sorry"?
-Sorry. Yes. Goddamn.

07:54.668 --> 07:56.772
Um... I don't know
what that-- Yeah.

07:56.805 --> 07:58.943
-Yeah.
-Um, and also, she, um...

07:58.976 --> 08:01.281
(sighs) She gave you something,
uh, a trophy,

08:01.315 --> 08:02.617
and-and it was not hers to give.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.354
Do-do you perhaps
still have that?

08:04.387 --> 08:06.525
-Yeah, I have it. I'll get it.
-Yeah? Okay, great.

08:06.558 --> 08:08.061
You know what?
I got to look up some clinics,

08:08.094 --> 08:09.598
'cause I really need a doctor
to fix my face

08:09.631 --> 08:10.633
before we're on TV.

08:11.835 --> 08:13.272
-Uh-oh.
-Hmm?

08:13.305 --> 08:15.409
-Whoa. Did-did you see that?
-What?

08:15.443 --> 08:16.812
See what?

08:16.845 --> 08:18.949
Uh, a black cat just ran
out of her apartment.

08:18.983 --> 08:20.920
-It just...
-I didn't see a cat.

08:20.953 --> 08:22.690
You kidding me?
It ran right past us.

08:22.724 --> 08:23.726
Well, that's not good.

08:23.759 --> 08:25.496
-A black cat?
-Yeah.

08:25.530 --> 08:26.899
Well, shit. What'd Charlie say
we were supposed to do

08:26.932 --> 08:27.967
if we saw it?
That's a bad omen.

08:28.001 --> 08:29.905
Oh. (spits)

08:29.938 --> 08:31.809
-Oh!
-(groaning)

08:31.842 --> 08:33.813
Uh-oh. I got you, didn't I?
Sorry about that.

08:33.846 --> 08:34.948
-Yes, you did.
-Yeah.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.418
Boy, that's a shame.

08:36.451 --> 08:37.654
-Thank you for this, though.
-Yeah.

08:37.687 --> 08:39.724
Um, listen, um...
Do you have a cat?

08:39.758 --> 08:41.662
'Cause I think I just saw one
run out of your apartment.

08:41.695 --> 08:43.566
-A cat?
-Yeah, yeah. A little black cat?

08:43.599 --> 08:46.939
I had a little black cat.
Her name was Maureen.

08:48.041 --> 08:49.411
Whoa.

08:49.444 --> 08:51.548
But she's been dead for years.

08:51.582 --> 08:53.819
Huh. That's crazy.

08:53.853 --> 08:55.923
I was, I was murdered
to a woman named Maureen.

08:55.957 --> 08:57.393
-Huh?
-Huh?

08:57.427 --> 08:58.729
No, I meant married.
I'm sorry.

08:58.762 --> 08:59.965
I was married
to a woman named Maureen.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.401
I-I...

09:01.435 --> 09:03.405
That's so weird.
I swear I saw a cat.

09:03.439 --> 09:04.641
You know what?
This place is full of cats.

09:04.674 --> 09:05.676
Can we get out of here,
please?

09:05.710 --> 09:07.012
-Yeah, go. Go.
-Okay.

09:07.045 --> 09:09.484
And please keep
the noise down at night.

09:09.518 --> 09:11.522
Yeah. Okay, you got it, cunt.

09:14.427 --> 09:15.763
Are you sure about this,
Cricket?

09:15.796 --> 09:17.600
Yeah, I'm sure about it, man.

09:17.634 --> 09:18.869
I've been greasing the doormen
of this building for years.

09:18.903 --> 09:20.506
Chase Utley's back in town.

09:20.540 --> 09:22.377
He's coming out of his apartment
any second now.

09:22.410 --> 09:23.879
Is it good intel? 'Cause I only
got one good shot at this.

09:23.913 --> 09:25.416
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
What do I know?

09:25.449 --> 09:26.752
I'm just a street rat, right?

09:26.785 --> 09:28.656
I'm just trash.
That's what you said.

09:28.689 --> 09:29.958
-Okay, Cricks, I'll tell you...
-You've got nothing for me.

09:29.991 --> 09:31.528
I knew you were gonna be
a little bit of

09:31.562 --> 09:32.095
a bitch about this,
so I did something nice.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.469
-I got
you a sixer.
-You got that for me?

09:35.503 --> 09:36.672
Yeah, I got a gift for you,
buddy.

09:36.705 --> 09:38.709
(laughs)
There's only four in here.

09:38.742 --> 09:40.413
I drank two of 'em, of course.

09:40.446 --> 09:42.082
Okay. All right. Well,
thank you. (clears throat)

09:42.115 --> 09:43.752
Oh, I'm gonna buy a six-pack
and not drink two?

09:43.786 --> 09:45.890
Well, yeah. That's kind of
the kind thing to...

09:45.923 --> 09:47.827
(stammers) But I-- Look, um,
thank you for the four.

09:47.860 --> 09:48.963
If I'm being honest,
I drank four.

09:48.996 --> 09:50.700
Two of those are piss.

09:50.733 --> 09:52.102
Because I was stuck in the van,
and you were out...

09:52.135 --> 09:53.939
You know what,
I don't even care, frankly.

09:53.973 --> 09:55.376
-I'm just glad
to have a beverage.
-Yeah. All right.

09:55.409 --> 09:56.678
(clears throat) All right, um...

09:56.712 --> 09:58.482
-(sighs)
-Dominus espritu sanctum, okay?

09:58.515 --> 10:00.686
-You're off.
-What was that?

10:00.720 --> 10:02.590
I was, uh, I was lifting
the curse that I put on you.

10:02.624 --> 10:05.863
Oh. Yeah, no,
I don't believe in curses.

10:05.897 --> 10:07.533
Yeah, that's anti-God,

10:07.567 --> 10:09.069
and God is the reason
that all things happen.

10:09.103 --> 10:10.673
And speaking of
things that happened,

10:10.706 --> 10:12.677
I got to show you something,
Cricks,

10:12.710 --> 10:14.981
but you got to keep it a secret.

10:16.017 --> 10:18.422
Something wrong with your dick?

10:18.455 --> 10:20.158
-What?
-Okay, I was waiting for this.

10:20.191 --> 10:21.929
If it's your dick, though,
I-I got to charge you for it.

10:21.962 --> 10:23.031
I'm gonna tell you right now.

10:23.064 --> 10:24.868
No. It's not my dick, Cricket.

10:24.901 --> 10:26.070
Well, if-if you're gonna
whip it out, uh,

10:26.103 --> 10:27.974
we're on the clock.
All right?

10:28.007 --> 10:29.678
-I'm not whipping anything out!
-There's a tiered system...

10:29.711 --> 10:31.548
Look. This.

10:31.582 --> 10:33.151
What? What is that?

10:33.184 --> 10:35.690
It's a monkey paw,
and I think it's good luck,

10:35.723 --> 10:37.059
like a rabbit's foot
or something like that,

10:37.092 --> 10:38.596
'cause ever since I found it,

10:38.629 --> 10:40.065
nothing but good things
have happened.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.668
Uh, sorry, I thought
God was the reason

10:41.702 --> 10:43.639
that anything good happens,
et cetera.

10:43.672 --> 10:47.614
Well, no. God decides
who the good things happen to

10:47.647 --> 10:49.149
and then who he smites.

10:49.183 --> 10:50.987
-You're not following.
-I-I can't follow it.

10:51.020 --> 10:52.690
-Cricket, I'm...
-It makes literally no sense.

10:52.724 --> 10:55.028
-You got to pick a lane.
-I don't even know why I even...

10:55.061 --> 10:56.665
-CRICKET: Let's get this open.
I'm feeling curious.
-Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:56.698 --> 10:57.867
Wait, that's-- there he is,
there he is. Okay.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.437
Let's go.

10:59.471 --> 11:02.075
-(car horns honk, tires screech)
-Mr. Utley?

11:02.109 --> 11:04.079
Mr. Utley?

11:04.113 --> 11:06.217
Mr. Utley, a moment
of your time, sir.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.987
Mr. Utley?

11:08.021 --> 11:09.891
Mr. Utley, hello?

11:09.924 --> 11:12.864
Hello. Oh, hi. Hi, Mr. Utley.

11:12.897 --> 11:14.801
Hey, uh, would you
like an autograph?

11:14.834 --> 11:17.139
Oh, no. That's a cl--
a classic, Mr. Utley.

11:17.172 --> 11:20.145
-I-It's me, Mac.
-I don't know a Mac.

11:20.178 --> 11:22.149
I wrote you a letter every week
for the last ten years.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.554
Did you not receive my letters?
There was a video.

11:24.587 --> 11:26.658
A video in response. Wait.

11:26.692 --> 11:28.929
"Dear Mac, I feel like
I can call you Mac

11:28.962 --> 11:30.666
"because you called me Chase.

11:30.700 --> 11:33.539
"Thank you for the compliment
on my hair.

11:33.572 --> 11:34.941
"It's my fourth favorite thing
after baseball,

11:34.975 --> 11:37.613
"running fast and my dad.

11:37.647 --> 11:39.484
"I'm sorry your dad
doesn't like you.

11:39.517 --> 11:41.655
"Maybe you could
become a better son.

11:41.688 --> 11:43.492
"Meeting you and having
a game of catch

11:43.525 --> 11:45.195
"sounds like a lot of fun,
but like I said,

11:45.228 --> 11:48.101
"I'm really busy playing a lot
of baseball for the Phillies.

11:48.134 --> 11:50.171
"I hope you have a good life.

11:50.205 --> 11:52.610
"Fans like you make my life
a 'grand slam.'

11:52.643 --> 11:54.781
Your good friend, Chase."

11:54.814 --> 11:56.785
-Wait, you're that Mac?
-Yes.

11:56.818 --> 11:59.056
I thought Mac was a little kid.

11:59.089 --> 12:01.561
Yes, there's a child. A child...

12:01.595 --> 12:04.768
A child born unto me.
Little Mac.

12:04.801 --> 12:06.505
-What?
-He's Little Mac, I'm Big Mac,

12:06.538 --> 12:07.707
and you shall have
a catch with him.

12:07.740 --> 12:08.976
Your hair, it's throwing me.

12:09.009 --> 12:11.147
It's making me very nervous.
(exhales)

12:11.180 --> 12:12.984
On the Dodgers, yes,
you were the Silver Fox.

12:13.017 --> 12:14.988
Philadelphia,
you were just the Fox.

12:15.021 --> 12:16.858
I don't know, man.
I'm pretty busy.

12:16.892 --> 12:20.700
Yes, we're all, we're all busy,
but the boy is sick.

12:22.069 --> 12:23.839
He's very sick.
He's, he's dying.

12:23.872 --> 12:26.912
He's got leukemia and you shall
have a catch with him.

12:26.945 --> 12:29.584
-Where's my car?
-I'll tweet that you didn't.

12:29.617 --> 12:31.120
I'm sorry. I threatened you.

12:31.153 --> 12:32.690
Now I'm upset and so are you.

12:32.724 --> 12:33.992
(exhales)

12:34.026 --> 12:37.734
A catch, we shall have?
Later today.

12:37.767 --> 12:40.539
Okay. Maybe, but for, like,
five minutes tops.

12:40.573 --> 12:43.278
-Yes. Yes, yes.
-I'm really busy.

12:43.312 --> 12:45.181
-(knocks on window)
-CHARLIE: Mom?

12:45.215 --> 12:47.620
Hey, can we pick your brain
about something?

12:47.653 --> 12:50.760
Oh, Charlie, I didn't think
you could make it.

12:50.793 --> 12:53.999
-Come on in.
-Yeah, shit, I forgot
it's Uncle Jack's birthday.

12:54.032 --> 12:56.003
Come on in, Charlie.
You can sit next to me.

12:56.036 --> 12:58.609
Nah, I'm good. Uh, we'll
come back later or something.

12:58.642 --> 13:00.613
No, no, no, no, Charlie.
I want a piece of cake.

13:00.646 --> 13:02.082
-Come on.
-Oh, do you? Oh, shit.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.652
Okay, all right, all right.

13:03.685 --> 13:06.725
♪ Happy birthday, dear Jack ♪

13:06.758 --> 13:10.231
-♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪
-Can we switch seats?

13:10.266 --> 13:12.202
-(laughter)
-Okay, make a wish.

13:12.235 --> 13:14.607
Oh, right, right, right.
Okay, you and I hold hands.

13:14.641 --> 13:17.012
-Nope.
-Okay, ready?

13:17.045 --> 13:18.715
-(exhales sharply)
-All right.

13:18.749 --> 13:20.352
-Oh!
-Good. All right.
Very good, very good.

13:20.386 --> 13:22.022
Hey, you want to know
my wish, Charlie?

13:22.055 --> 13:23.926
-Sure don't, pal.
-Ooh, don't tell him your wish,

13:23.959 --> 13:26.030
-it won't come true.
-Yeah, there you go.

13:26.063 --> 13:27.867
-Exactly.
-I made a wish, too.

13:27.900 --> 13:30.071
How about you and me go on
upstairs with some cake, Bon?

13:30.105 --> 13:31.975
Hey, Frank, you don't
get a wish, okay?

13:32.008 --> 13:33.812
-That's not how
birthday candles work.
-(both laugh)

13:33.846 --> 13:35.749
-Says who?
-Uh, look, that's not
why we're here!

13:35.783 --> 13:37.219
Mom, Frank killed a seagull.

13:37.252 --> 13:38.322
(screams)

13:38.355 --> 13:39.924
(groans)

13:39.958 --> 13:41.361
Hey, that's not good, Frank.

13:41.394 --> 13:42.997
Yeah, we know it's not good,
Uncle Jack. Okay?

13:43.030 --> 13:44.734
That's why-- that's why
we came here, all right?

13:44.768 --> 13:46.338
Mom, now is that the kind
of thing that could put, like,

13:46.371 --> 13:49.811
-a curse on Frank?
-Yes.

13:49.844 --> 13:54.354
They say that a sailor's spirit
lives on in the gulls,

13:54.387 --> 13:57.025
and if you kill a gull,
the sailor

13:57.058 --> 13:59.163
can haunt you
for the rest of its life.

13:59.196 --> 14:01.167
-No shit?
-Yeah, well, is there
anything we can do,

14:01.200 --> 14:04.340
-or, like...
-Well, you could slit
Frank's throat

14:04.374 --> 14:07.780
with a horn of a goat
and drink a bowl of his blood.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.284
What?

14:09.317 --> 14:11.788
Well, uh, okay, yeah,
maybe not, maybe not that.

14:11.822 --> 14:13.392
Is, like, there
anything else, or...

14:13.425 --> 14:14.928
Ooh!

14:14.961 --> 14:17.400
He could behead the gull
and wear its skull

14:17.433 --> 14:20.171
around his neck
for the rest of his life.

14:20.205 --> 14:21.408
Mom, that's not gonna work,
'cause we don't have

14:21.441 --> 14:23.312
-the gull anymore.
-Yeah, we do.

14:23.345 --> 14:24.848
It's at the bar.

14:24.881 --> 14:26.217
-What? It is?
-Mm, yeah.

14:26.250 --> 14:27.720
I kicked it under
one of the booths

14:27.753 --> 14:29.256
so I didn't have to clean it up.

14:29.290 --> 14:30.960
(stammers)

14:30.993 --> 14:32.830
Okay, so you're telling me
that you want to wear

14:32.864 --> 14:35.436
a seagull skull around your neck
for the rest of your life?

14:35.469 --> 14:37.773
I don't know. Could be cool.

14:37.807 --> 14:38.809
No, we're not doing that.
That's crazy.

14:38.842 --> 14:39.911
Mom, anything else?

14:39.944 --> 14:42.215
You could give the seagull

14:42.249 --> 14:44.754
a proper burial.

14:44.787 --> 14:47.827
What? Well, yeah,
that one, Mom. That one.

14:47.860 --> 14:49.964
Why didn't you lead off with
that one in the first place?

14:49.998 --> 14:52.670
Well, sometimes
you're at sea, Charlie,

14:52.703 --> 14:54.908
and you wouldn't
have that option.

14:54.941 --> 14:56.444
Do I look like I'm at sea, Mom?

14:56.478 --> 14:58.247
-I don't know.
-You don't know if I'm at sea?

14:58.282 --> 14:59.717
-(shushing)
-You don't, uh--
Uncle Jack, stop.

14:59.751 --> 15:00.786
Stop putting your hand on me.

15:08.402 --> 15:10.439
(exhales)
Looking for this.

15:10.472 --> 15:12.343
What is it?

15:12.376 --> 15:14.246
Maureen Ponderosa.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.116
-Well, why do you have that?
-Well, I wanted to keep it

15:16.150 --> 15:18.755
as a-a-a...

15:18.789 --> 15:21.260
Oh, a trophy? From the murder.

15:21.294 --> 15:23.231
No, not a-- What?
No, not a trophy.

15:23.265 --> 15:25.034
I-- As-- I wanted...

15:25.068 --> 15:26.705
Like a souvenir,
f-from your victim.

15:26.738 --> 15:28.241
Not a souvenir, no.
It's-it's, a...

15:28.275 --> 15:31.080
It's a-- I wanted to keep it
as a w-way to spite her.

15:31.113 --> 15:32.416
Which one? Which one's it under?

15:32.450 --> 15:34.454
-Uh, by the jukebox. Over here.
-Oh-- ah!

15:34.487 --> 15:36.023
-Over here.
-I see it, yeah.
Let me get a trash bag.

15:36.056 --> 15:37.827
-Eh.
-(groans)

15:37.860 --> 15:40.231
-What the hell is that?
-That's the gull Frank killed.

15:40.266 --> 15:42.403
-(groans) All right.
-What's that?

15:42.436 --> 15:44.006
Oh, that's his dead wife.

15:44.039 --> 15:45.476
-Yeah.
-Looks like a trophy.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.914
No, it's not a-a trophy, okay?
(stammers)

15:47.947 --> 15:49.450
The crazy bitch had it
in her will that she wanted

15:49.484 --> 15:52.055
to be buried in a pet cemetery,
and I refused.

15:52.088 --> 15:53.492
Wait a second.

15:53.525 --> 15:55.396
You refused your wife's
dying wishes

15:55.429 --> 15:57.900
to be buried in a pet cemetery?
Why would you do that?

15:57.934 --> 15:59.370
Because she's not a cat.

15:59.404 --> 16:00.806
Yeah, but, dude, like,
that's-that's the exact

16:00.839 --> 16:01.908
kind of thing that could
lead to a curse.

16:01.942 --> 16:03.445
That... I know.

16:03.478 --> 16:05.816
-I-- Yes. Okay, I get that now.
-(door opens)

16:05.849 --> 16:07.420
-This is bullshit, Cricket.
-I don't know what
you're so upset about.

16:07.453 --> 16:09.156
Y-You said get a kid.

16:09.189 --> 16:11.928
I mean, his name on the street
is literally "Kid."

16:11.962 --> 16:14.166
-That's what he goes by.
-He is a grown man.

16:14.199 --> 16:16.838
I can be whatever
you want me to be, champ.

16:16.871 --> 16:19.242
-I'll make your dreams
come true.
-Oh, he can.

16:19.277 --> 16:21.013
-Would you make it--
Do a, do a turn. Do a spin.
-Oh.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.052
There you go. Make it sexy.
Let's go.

16:25.589 --> 16:27.526
-(exhales)
-Yeah.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.096
Uh, move the bangs,
put the bangs.

16:29.129 --> 16:30.766
Show them your face,
show them your face.

16:30.799 --> 16:33.037
-Yeah. Huh?
-Hey.

16:33.070 --> 16:34.974
-Get him out of here.
-All right, yeah. You're gone.

16:35.008 --> 16:36.110
-Uh, here. Go.
-Oh, yeah...

16:36.143 --> 16:37.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:37.313 --> 16:38.482
Drugs? Mm.

16:38.515 --> 16:40.853
-No eyes.
-(grunts)

16:40.886 --> 16:42.088
Okay.

16:42.122 --> 16:43.257
It's all about respect.

16:43.292 --> 16:44.827
Mac, what the hell is this?

16:44.861 --> 16:47.500
Um, I believe that Cricket
is now a pimp,

16:47.533 --> 16:49.337
and that was his boy slut.

16:49.370 --> 16:51.474
Uh, t-that's oversimplifying it.

16:51.508 --> 16:53.578
But, uh, that's-that's it
in a nutshell.

16:53.612 --> 16:55.181
No, we got that.
He got, yeah, he means like...

16:55.214 --> 16:57.386
Yes. I-I mean,
what are you doing with Cricket?

16:57.420 --> 16:58.855
No, he's got a monkey paw.
(chuckles)

16:58.889 --> 17:01.226
Ugh, come on, Cricket.
That's a secret.

17:01.260 --> 17:02.997
Oh, I can't keep secret--
Honestly, I'm so high,

17:03.030 --> 17:04.567
I'm thinking about it,
and I'm gonna go

17:04.600 --> 17:07.238
with him in the bathroom
and finish up the-- Yeah.

17:07.273 --> 17:08.842
CHARLIE:
Mac, what's going on

17:08.875 --> 17:10.279
with the monkey paw?
What is this?

17:10.312 --> 17:11.414
You know how I've been
chasing Chase Utley

17:11.448 --> 17:13.084
for years to have a catch?

17:13.117 --> 17:15.054
Well, I finally got to him
and we were supposed

17:15.088 --> 17:17.560
to have a catch tomorrow
with my "dying son."

17:17.593 --> 17:19.262
Cricket was gonna
help me find one,

17:19.297 --> 17:21.468
-but he brought back a junkie.
-Wait, wait, wait.

17:21.501 --> 17:24.172
You actually met Chase Utley?
How'd you do that?

17:24.206 --> 17:26.277
Well, ever since I found
this monkey's paw,

17:26.311 --> 17:28.214
my luck has totally
turned around.

17:28.247 --> 17:30.886
Well, actually,
it wasn't just a paw.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.925
It was a whole monkey behind
the kegs, and he was dead.

17:33.959 --> 17:35.996
He had this cash in his hand,
and when I went

17:36.030 --> 17:37.967
to grab the cash, the whole hand
just, like, kind of popped out,

17:38.000 --> 17:39.504
and I've been carrying it around
ever since.

17:39.537 --> 17:41.374
(laughs): Monkey in the bar,
right? Totally random.

17:41.408 --> 17:43.378
Wha-- that-that's not
random at all.

17:43.412 --> 17:45.482
That's probably the monkey
that worked here,

17:45.516 --> 17:47.353
-robbed us and fucked our faces.
-FRANK: He got stuck
behind the keg.

17:47.386 --> 17:49.357
-It's behind the kegs?
-MAC: Well, actually,

17:49.390 --> 17:51.260
I found him by the office,
but I kicked him behind the kegs

17:51.294 --> 17:53.230
because I didn't feel
like cleaning him up.

17:53.265 --> 17:54.534
-Oh!
-Goddamn it!

17:54.567 --> 17:56.136
-(all groaning)
-Well, he is decomposing

17:56.170 --> 17:58.074
and there's also
a shit-ton of mold back there.

17:58.107 --> 17:59.042
-Shit, now I smell it.
-I don't know
how I missed that.

17:59.076 --> 18:00.946
CHARLIE:
Okay, okay.

18:00.979 --> 18:02.316
I got a new fix, all right?
I got a new fix for everything.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.252
We're gonna take, uh, your wife,

18:04.287 --> 18:05.956
the gull
and what's left of the monkey,

18:05.989 --> 18:07.493
and we're gonna bury them all
in a pet cemetery.

18:07.526 --> 18:09.597
And Mac, you are gonna have
a catch with Chase Utley,

18:09.630 --> 18:11.233
but not with your dying son.

18:11.267 --> 18:13.372
-Why not?
-'Cause he's already dead.

18:13.405 --> 18:14.941
(bagpipes playing)

18:15.976 --> 18:17.245
CHASE:
I'm confused.

18:17.279 --> 18:18.482
This is your son?

18:18.515 --> 18:20.118
Oh, yes, Mr. Utley.

18:20.151 --> 18:21.654
I didn't have the heart
to tell you earlier.

18:21.688 --> 18:24.226
He was only ten years old
when he died. He's dead now.

18:24.259 --> 18:26.130
Why is he buried
at a pet cemetery?

18:26.163 --> 18:29.069
Dogs. He loved dogs.

18:29.102 --> 18:30.506
Okay, man. What is this?

18:30.539 --> 18:32.309
What's going on?

18:32.343 --> 18:34.347
(sighs)

18:34.380 --> 18:36.250
I'm sorry, I...

18:36.284 --> 18:39.957
(sighs) Look, I know you're
gonna think that this is crazy,

18:39.991 --> 18:41.995
but I-I found this monkey paw,

18:42.028 --> 18:43.899
and it's brought me
really good luck.

18:43.932 --> 18:46.438
And I know that you don't think
superstitions are real,

18:46.471 --> 18:47.907
and that this is all
ridiculous...

18:47.940 --> 18:49.644
Not real?
Of course they're real.

18:49.677 --> 18:51.948
-What, really?
-Yeah.

18:51.981 --> 18:53.418
How do you think baseball
players get out of their slumps?

18:53.452 --> 18:55.254
With superstitions.

18:55.289 --> 18:57.560
'Cause what they believe
influences their actions.

18:57.593 --> 18:59.196
But actions do have
consequences.

18:59.229 --> 19:01.634
Like lying, Mac.

19:01.668 --> 19:03.405
Why don't you hand over
that monkey paw?

19:05.342 --> 19:07.178
You're right.

19:07.212 --> 19:10.419
You're right, actions
do have consequences, and I...

19:10.452 --> 19:12.423
I'm really sorry, man,
I think...

19:12.456 --> 19:14.961
Hall of Fame, baby, here I come!

19:16.498 --> 19:18.702
What the hell
was that all about?

19:18.735 --> 19:22.041
I think Chase Utley
just stole my monkey paw.

19:22.075 --> 19:24.547
Oh. Well, then, maybe
the curse has been lifted.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.085
-Oh. Right, yeah.
-Uh, hey, guys? Um...

19:27.118 --> 19:29.156
-Hmm?
-Check this out.

19:29.189 --> 19:31.661
Okay, so, apparently, um...

19:31.694 --> 19:34.367
temporary facial paralysis
and brain fog

19:34.400 --> 19:36.704
are all symptoms of exposure
to high levels of mold.

19:37.706 --> 19:39.410
-Huh?
-Oh...

19:39.443 --> 19:41.748
You know what? That might
also explain the silverfish.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.250
Yeah, no, it does.
Actually, it does.

19:43.285 --> 19:44.453
They eat mold.

19:44.487 --> 19:45.656
-Huh?
-And what about my egg?

19:45.689 --> 19:46.691
Well, is it possible, Frank,

19:46.724 --> 19:48.428
that that egg was a seagull egg?

19:48.461 --> 19:50.299
(tongue clicks)

19:50.332 --> 19:52.001
-Oh...
-That might've been,
because, you know what,

19:52.035 --> 19:53.605
-we found some eggs...
-And we...

19:53.638 --> 19:55.309
-And you might've mixed them up.
-I might've swapped--

19:55.342 --> 19:56.978
-mixed them up.
-Yeah, 'cause we had store eggs

19:57.011 --> 19:58.381
-and we had found eggs.
-You did a flip-flop.

19:58.415 --> 19:59.517
-You did a flip-flop.
-Yeah, there you go.

19:59.550 --> 20:00.719
So, the-- so, there's no curse.

20:00.752 --> 20:02.623
Oh, no. Hold on a second.

20:02.656 --> 20:04.560
"Dear Mr. McDonald,
we regret to inform you

20:04.594 --> 20:07.333
that we came by your bar
and there was nobody there."

20:07.366 --> 20:09.102
-Huh?
-"After several failed attempts

20:09.135 --> 20:11.374
"to reach you, we have decided
to rescind our offer.

20:11.407 --> 20:14.413
We wish you the best of luck.
Your friends at Bar Rescue."

20:14.447 --> 20:15.782
Damn it.
If I had that monkey paw,

20:15.816 --> 20:17.453
none of this would've happened.

20:17.486 --> 20:18.655
Yeah, so that means
we are still cursed.

20:18.688 --> 20:20.091
-Oh, no.
-Shit.
-It doesn't!

20:20.124 --> 20:21.427
We're not-- There is no curse.

20:21.461 --> 20:23.431
Okay? Mac, no,
you were never lucky.

20:23.465 --> 20:25.569
Okay? You just bombarded them
both with mail.

20:25.602 --> 20:27.238
And you stalked Chase Utley
for years.

20:27.273 --> 20:30.345
We're not unlucky, okay?
We're just the type of...

20:30.379 --> 20:32.683
We're just the type of people
to bury various animals

20:32.716 --> 20:35.289
and-and wives in a pet cemetery

20:35.322 --> 20:36.791
when we know
we should be at work.

20:36.824 --> 20:39.062
-Oh, yeah.
-Let's go back to the bar.

20:39.095 --> 20:40.766
-(soft laughter)
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:40.799 --> 20:43.103
Uh, what about me?
What about my luck?

20:43.137 --> 20:46.744
I don't know, Cricks, I guess...
there's no real explanation

20:46.778 --> 20:48.748
as to why bad things
would happen to you.

20:48.782 --> 20:50.786
-Yeah.
-Maybe it's just one
of those things, Cricket.

20:50.819 --> 20:52.356
-That's life.
That's life, sometimes.
-Yeah, man.

20:52.389 --> 20:54.092
-It is what it is.
-You got a dark cloud

20:54.125 --> 20:56.096
-following you around.
-CHARLIE: It is what it is.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.533
-FRANK: That's all
there is to it.
-MAC: It is what it is.

20:57.566 --> 20:58.501
-CHARLIE: It is what it is.
-DENNIS: Nice day.
