WE HUGGED A LOT.
WE CRIED A WHOLE LOT.

19:09.579 --> 19:13.323
AND, YES, OLD TIMERS' DISEASE
CAN TAKE YOU LIKE THAT.

19:13.323 --> 19:16.326
BUT HE COULD ALSO BE AROUND
FOR ANOTHER 10 YEARS.

19:16.326 --> 19:19.689
AS A FAMILY, WE DECIDED
THAT WE'RE GONNA STAY POSITIVE.

19:19.689 --> 19:22.161
SINCE YOU'RE ALL A PART
OF MY FAMILY,

19:22.161 --> 19:23.833
I JUST ASK THAT WE'RE THERE
FOR EACH OTHER

19:23.833 --> 19:26.536
AND WE CHERISH WHATEVER TIME
THAT WE HAVE.

19:26.536 --> 19:28.868
OTHER THAN THAT,
NOTHING CHANGES.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.870
IT SEEMS
LIKE IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW,

19:30.870 --> 19:33.873
BUT ARE WE STILL GOING
ON THIS TRIP?

19:33.873 --> 19:36.206
OH, RIGHT. ONE THING CHANGED.

в™Є WHEN I BELIEVE IN YOU в™Є

19:38.348 --> 19:39.949
LOS ANGELES!

19:39.949 --> 19:42.882
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE ACTUALLY HERE!

19:42.882 --> 19:45.615
Jules: YEAH,
JUST LIKE OUR BEACHES AT HOME,

19:45.615 --> 19:50.189
EXCEPT FOR WITH SMOG AND...
WEIRD PEOPLE.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.192
WE CAN DO THIS.
SMILES FOR DAD, Y'ALL.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.594
YAY!
YEAH!

19:54.594 --> 19:57.667
HOLLYWOOD!

20:01.431 --> 20:04.604
HEY, JULES. IT'S TOM
IN THE BEAUTIFUL BAHAMAS.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.206
UH, LEAVE ME A MESSAGE
BECAUSE I CAN'T FIND YOU GUYS.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.608
I, UH, TALKED
TO THE HOTEL CLERK.

20:08.608 --> 20:09.879
HE SAID THAT
NO ONE'S CHECKED IN

20:09.879 --> 20:11.411
AND THE ROOMS WERE CANCELED,

20:11.411 --> 20:12.742
SO, IF YOU'RE RUNNING LATE,
NO PROBLEM.

20:12.742 --> 20:14.744
I'LL, UH -- I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

20:14.744 --> 20:17.617
UH, IF YOU GUYS PLAYED
A TRICK ON ME

20:17.617 --> 20:20.490
AND YOU'RE
NOT ACTUALLY SHOWING UP?

20:20.490 --> 20:23.222
GOOD ONE. [ CHUCKLES ]
I LOVE WHEN YOU PLAY GAGS ON ME.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.625
UM, CALL ME BACK.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.897
UH -- THIS IS TOM.

20:27.897 --> 20:30.500
UH, BAHAMAS TOM.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.662
UH, TOMMY-BAHAMMY.
