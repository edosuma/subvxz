12:40.201 --> 12:42.002
Memphis would be a hell of a lot safer.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.299
A lot less fun, but a
hell of a lot safer, right?

- (laughs)

19:41.223 --> 19:43.162
I can't stop looking at that door.

Used to be two of 'em.
Now one is bricked up.

19:48.338 --> 19:50.333
Isn't that a strange thing to focus on?

19:50.358 --> 19:53.154
All these years, and it's
a door that's hanging me up.

19:58.671 --> 20:00.177
I used to have a bit of a 'fro.

20:01.008 --> 20:03.950
- Nah.
- Yeah, into my 30s, actually.

20:04.313 --> 20:07.271
But then I made partner, life
started to get more serious.

20:07.755 --> 20:09.912
Needed to update the look.

20:11.922 --> 20:13.490
Oh, Tess was about three at the time.

20:14.103 --> 20:17.539
And when I came home from
the barbershop that Saturday,

20:17.564 --> 20:19.198
clean-shaven, clean-cut,

20:19.223 --> 20:21.888
she took one look at
me and started bawling.

20:21.913 --> 20:22.865
(laughs): No.

20:22.890 --> 20:25.240
Damn near hyperventilated, the poor kid.

20:26.372 --> 20:28.130
And it wasn't that she
didn't recognize me.

20:28.416 --> 20:29.583
It just took her a minute

20:29.608 --> 20:31.521
to see past the bricked-up
front door, was all.

20:37.091 --> 20:39.708

- Oh. Okay.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.747
Well, there's probably people

20:41.772 --> 20:43.014
- who live there now, so...
- I want to see if my

20:43.038 --> 20:45.193
- treasure is still there.
- Your what? Hey.

20:45.218 --> 20:46.218
(knocks)

20:46.961 --> 20:48.927
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.

20:49.255 --> 20:54.068
Um, you don't know us, but my
father grew up in this house,

20:54.786 --> 20:58.224

he could take a look around.

21:00.325 --> 21:01.810

21:23.045 --> 21:24.958

later, they're still here.

Man, that was a hell of a thing you did,

37:05.540 --> 37:06.873
knocking on my door that day.

37:06.908 --> 37:09.576
(laughs) Come on, man.

37:12.990 --> 37:15.427
Roll all your windows down, Randall.

37:17.812 --> 37:19.357
Crank up the music.

37:21.355 --> 37:22.974
Grow out that 'fro.

37:25.732 --> 37:27.727
Let someone else make your bed.

37:28.685 --> 37:31.097
I like making my damn bed, old man.

37:33.286 --> 37:34.708
Then you make it.

37:37.810 --> 37:39.122
You deserve it.

37:42.130 --> 37:44.872
You deserve the beautiful
life you've made.

37:47.982 --> 37:49.919
You deserve everything, Randall.

37:53.355 --> 37:55.450
My beautiful boy.

38:01.517 --> 38:02.732
My son.

38:10.763 --> 38:12.685
I haven't had a happy life.

38:18.354 --> 38:22.552
Bad breaks and... bad choices.

38:25.686 --> 38:28.365
A life of almosts and could-haves.

38:31.788 --> 38:34.056
Some would call it sad, but I don't.

38:37.967 --> 38:40.497
'Cause the two best things in my life...

38:42.958 --> 38:46.419
... were the person in
the very beginning...

38:48.418 --> 38:50.521
... and the person at the very end.

38:54.687 --> 38:57.615
That's a pretty good thing
to be able to say, I think.

38:59.199 --> 39:00.763
I think so, too.

39:03.199 --> 39:04.372
(labored breathing)

39:12.419 --> 39:13.849
I'm a little scared.

39:15.638 --> 39:17.052
(labored breathing continues)

39:18.677 --> 39:20.010
(sniffles)

39:27.216 --> 39:28.255
(coughs)

39:28.280 --> 39:30.044
You're okay, Dad.

39:30.410 --> 39:31.505
Mm-hmm.

39:36.122 --> 39:37.380
You're good.

39:38.544 --> 39:39.591
Just breathe.

39:39.616 --> 39:40.616
Mm-hmm.

39:40.916 --> 39:42.974
Come on, now, breathe with me.

39:45.896 --> 39:47.216
(breathing deeply)

39:47.572 --> 39:49.068
There you go.

39:52.949 --> 39:54.482
