01:06.854 --> 01:10.389
5 more minutes and then
mommy's gotta get ready for work.

01:10.457 --> 01:13.658
Why did you
always go to work, Mommy?

01:13.727 --> 01:15.919
Well, um, because

01:15.944 --> 01:17.944
there's people out there
that need my help.

01:17.964 --> 01:19.664

I wish I did.

01:23.302 --> 01:27.239

as soon as I can.

01:27.306 --> 01:29.273

our promises, right?

01:29.341 --> 01:30.274
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:30.342 --> 01:31.663
Ok, well, then
you need to promise

01:31.676 --> 01:33.611
that you're gonna be a good boy
for daddy while I'm gone.

01:33.678 --> 01:35.246

Whoa!

01:36.314 --> 01:38.716
Ha ha ha ha!
Whoa!

01:38.784 --> 01:42.519
We're gonna make
a pre-emptive trip to Los Angeles.

01:42.587 --> 01:45.222
This unsub kills
on the same date every year.

01:45.289 --> 01:46.256
Go ahead, Garcia.

01:46.323 --> 01:47.924
Ok. I present to you,
crime-fighters,

01:47.992 --> 01:49.726
an oldie but not
such a goodie.

01:49.794 --> 01:51.061
I give you Rachel Hughes,

01:51.129 --> 01:52.462
Melissa Martinez,

01:52.529 --> 01:54.697
Tara Rios, Diana Brooks,

01:54.766 --> 01:56.233
and Gloria Clemente.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.201
You guys know the deets.
This is news to you, Blake.

01:58.269 --> 02:00.335
Over the last 5 years,
each of these women

02:00.403 --> 02:01.771
have disappeared from a park

02:01.838 --> 02:03.639
off the California coast,
from as far south

02:03.706 --> 02:05.641
as San Diego and far north
as San Francisco.

02:05.708 --> 02:06.813
Each of them were nannies

02:06.838 --> 02:08.437
who were kidnapped
while watching kids.

02:09.312 --> 02:10.711
Thankfully, each of
the little ones

02:10.781 --> 02:13.215
was returned to
a church or hospital totally unharmed

02:13.283 --> 02:14.516
within 24 hours.

02:14.584 --> 02:16.384
But the nannies were found dead,
posed on park benches

02:16.451 --> 02:17.886
and Los Angeles playgrounds.

02:17.953 --> 02:19.988
One a year,
always on the same date.

02:20.055 --> 02:22.056
May 13. The actual abduction
date varies from case to case,

02:22.124 --> 02:23.357
but the unsub goes
to great lengths

02:23.425 --> 02:25.559
to make sure the bodies
are found that exact day.

02:25.627 --> 02:28.529
All except victim number 3,
Tara Rios.

02:28.597 --> 02:30.064
Somehow she managed to escape.

02:30.132 --> 02:33.033
Garbage truck driver found her
passed out in an alley in Hollywood.

02:33.101 --> 02:35.435
She had no idea who took her
or where he held her.

02:35.503 --> 02:37.404
Morgan and I questioned her,
I even tried to do cognitive,

02:37.471 --> 02:38.906
but she was way
too traumatized

02:38.973 --> 02:40.573
to remember much of
anything at all.

02:40.641 --> 02:43.243
Clearly she dissociated
from the event.

02:43.311 --> 02:45.212
We've contacted her several
times over the past few years

02:45.280 --> 02:47.847
trying to get more info,
but she just refuses to talk to us.

02:47.915 --> 02:49.248
Her reluctance
isn't surprising.

02:49.316 --> 02:51.284
Each of the victims
was sexually assaulted

02:51.351 --> 02:54.086
and tortured with burning
implements for several days.

02:54.154 --> 02:56.022
And then he drowned them
in scalding water when he was done.

02:56.089 --> 02:57.623
But no matter where
he grabs them,

02:57.691 --> 02:59.425
he always returns them
to L.A.

02:59.492 --> 03:01.127
Both the location
and that date

03:01.195 --> 03:04.529
obviously means something
significant, but what?

03:04.596 --> 03:06.464
May 13 is two weeks away.

03:06.532 --> 03:08.700
Garcia, go ahead and alert
the press on the West Coast.

03:08.767 --> 03:10.368
When we land in L.A.,
Morgan and JJ

03:10.436 --> 03:11.703
will take the jet
to Seattle

03:11.770 --> 03:13.805
and make a personal plea
to Tara Rios.

03:13.873 --> 03:16.041
Wheels up in 30.

03:31.122 --> 03:33.157
Ok, see you guys next week.

03:33.225 --> 03:35.759
Bye, Miss Gina.
Bye.

03:35.827 --> 03:39.162
I want to go
feed the birds.

03:41.966 --> 03:44.567
You hungry for lunch?

03:44.634 --> 03:46.002
We got some
mac and cheese.

03:46.070 --> 03:49.072
Maybe you'll actually
eat your broccoli today.

03:49.139 --> 03:50.974
You got your
hands full, huh?

03:51.041 --> 03:53.575
Cute. What is she,
about 2?

03:53.642 --> 03:54.809
Yeah, almost.

03:54.878 --> 03:56.144
What's her name?

03:56.212 --> 03:57.512
Phoebe.

named Phoebe Payton.

Think that's our guy?

I'd bet on it.

06:28.015 --> 06:29.849
I think he's ahead of schedule.
He's never abducted his victims

06:29.916 --> 06:32.282
more than 4 days before
the anniversary date.

06:38.190 --> 06:41.225
Phoebe's got asthma.

worked for you?

Oh, about 4 years.

06:51.436 --> 06:54.204
That's a long time.

06:54.272 --> 06:56.206
The baby is barely 2.

06:56.274 --> 06:58.642
Yeah. We hired her
when we got pregnant...

06:58.710 --> 06:59.910
The first time.

06:59.978 --> 07:02.579
I'm sorry,
the first time?

07:02.647 --> 07:04.347
I had a late miscarriage,

07:04.415 --> 07:06.416
and then we had
a stillbirth.

07:06.484 --> 07:08.386
Gina stayed on.

07:08.411 --> 07:11.307
You know, we were both
pretty shook up,

07:11.388 --> 07:13.455
and I travel a lot for work.

07:13.523 --> 07:16.059
So, she helped out
around the house.

07:16.126 --> 07:19.796
Gina doesn't just
work for us, she's like family.

07:19.863 --> 07:21.430
She lost both her parents
when she was a teenager,

07:21.498 --> 07:25.100
so it's kind of like
we adopted her in a way.

07:25.168 --> 07:28.503
It's true, right?
This man, he always--

07:28.571 --> 07:30.505
he always
gives the kids back?

07:30.573 --> 07:32.473
Yes, he has.

07:32.541 --> 07:34.242
And they're ok?

07:34.310 --> 07:35.744
He doesn't--

07:35.812 --> 07:37.645
he's returned all
of the children unharmed

07:37.714 --> 07:39.414
in the first 24 hours,
either to a church

07:39.481 --> 07:41.215
or to a hospital.

07:41.282 --> 07:43.250
Oh, God.

07:51.793 --> 07:52.914
She needs her medicine.

07:52.961 --> 07:54.328
She has asthma.

07:54.395 --> 07:56.097
Please, let me help her.

to save your own skin.

You're all the same.

08:11.445 --> 08:13.278
She'll die!

08:13.346 --> 08:16.949
She'll die if you can't
take the pain.

08:19.252 --> 08:21.353
In their statements,
two of the other families

08:21.420 --> 08:23.521
said the same thing
about their nannies.

08:23.589 --> 08:24.989
"She was more
than just an employee.

08:25.024 --> 08:26.625
She was almost like family."

08:26.692 --> 08:28.793
Well, it's not uncommon
to form that kind of a bond

08:28.861 --> 08:30.194
with your child's caregiver.

08:30.262 --> 08:32.630
But what if the connection
they have with the children

08:32.697 --> 08:34.631
is what sparks
the unsub's interest?

08:34.698 --> 08:36.700
Maybe it's not just
about them being nannies.

08:36.769 --> 08:39.535
He could be keying in
on the relationship itself.

08:39.604 --> 08:41.038
And he would have to
stalk them and know

08:41.106 --> 08:43.407
their routines well enough
to be able to pick up on that.

08:43.475 --> 08:45.308
I'll have Reid and Rossi
retrace Gina's steps,

08:45.376 --> 08:49.012
and we should interview
the victims' families again.

08:49.080 --> 08:52.382
If he sticks to his schedule,
Phoebe could turn up soon.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.684
Let's hope so.

09:02.793 --> 09:04.160
I just talked
to a bunch of nannies

09:04.227 --> 09:05.828
over at the observatory.

09:05.896 --> 09:07.763
They knew Gina and Phoebe.

09:07.831 --> 09:10.833
Said they're here every,
uh, Tuesday and Thursday.

09:10.901 --> 09:12.334
A regular schedule
or routine

09:12.402 --> 09:13.903
gives children
a sense of security.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.272
That would make it easy
for him to stalk her.

09:16.339 --> 09:17.859
He knew exactly
when she would be here.

09:17.907 --> 09:19.507
She never made it
back to the car,

09:19.574 --> 09:21.085
which means he grabbed her
somewhere between here

09:21.110 --> 09:22.743
and the observatory.

09:22.744 --> 09:25.947
Broad daylight, public park,
LAPD regularly

09:26.015 --> 09:28.016
patrolling the area.
This guy's got cojones.

09:28.083 --> 09:29.450
He probably threatens
the children

09:29.518 --> 09:31.585
as a means to gain
the nanny's compliance.

09:31.653 --> 09:33.120
Well, we know he's got
his own transport.

09:33.188 --> 09:35.422
It's gotta be a van
or an SUV.

09:35.489 --> 09:38.125
And he's patient.
He only kills once a year.

09:38.193 --> 09:40.894
The rest of the time,
he's stalking or planning.

09:40.962 --> 09:43.697
One thing's different, though.
He's back in Griffith Park.

09:43.764 --> 09:44.865
Coincidence?

09:44.933 --> 09:46.533
Griffith Park spans
4,310 acres,

09:46.600 --> 09:49.302
making it one of the largest
urban parks on all of North America.

09:49.369 --> 09:52.104
Given the sheer size,
coincidence certainly is a possibility.

09:52.172 --> 09:53.973
But he's never
repeated parks before.

09:54.041 --> 09:56.175

11:30.531 --> 11:32.299
Tara?

11:33.634 --> 11:36.970
Tara?

11:37.038 --> 11:38.738
Please.

11:38.806 --> 11:40.773
Help us.

11:46.313 --> 11:47.879
No.

11:51.751 --> 11:54.553
LAPD's got every church and
hospital in the city covered.

11:54.620 --> 11:55.921
So far nothing.

11:55.989 --> 11:57.121
Maybe the police presence
scared him off.

11:57.189 --> 11:58.689
They're only using
plainclothes.

11:58.757 --> 12:01.492
Even so, this guy has
evaded arrest for this long.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.361
He's probably got a nose
for cops.

12:03.429 --> 12:05.296
I don't know.
He's a creature of habit.

12:05.364 --> 12:08.799
Veering off his schedule
would be a big departure in his M.O.

12:08.867 --> 12:10.368
He's already veering
from his schedule, though.

12:10.436 --> 12:12.536
I mean, he abducted Gina
earlier than expected.

12:12.604 --> 12:14.537
He never keeps the children
longer than 24 hours.

12:14.605 --> 12:16.940
He's had Phoebe for 28.

12:17.008 --> 12:18.775
I wonder what that means
for Gina.

12:18.843 --> 12:20.363
Will he stick
to his schedule with her?

12:20.378 --> 12:22.279
He returned all 5
of the other kids.

12:22.347 --> 12:23.813
Why is he
holding Phoebe?

12:23.881 --> 12:27.184
We should consider the implications
if he doesn't bring her back.

12:56.281 --> 12:57.381
Agent Hotchner?

12:57.449 --> 12:58.683
Yes.

12:58.751 --> 13:00.151
Have you heard anything?

13:00.218 --> 13:02.219
No, nothing yet.
I'm sorry.

13:02.287 --> 13:05.322
So...So what now?

13:05.390 --> 13:06.824
We keep pursuing
the investigation.

13:06.892 --> 13:08.492
We leave no stone
unturned.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.227
But you said he always
gives the kids back

13:11.295 --> 13:12.663
within 24 hours.
It's been almost 30.

13:12.730 --> 13:15.398
That's true, that's
been his pattern, yes.

13:15.466 --> 13:17.400
So where's Phoebe?

13:18.302 --> 13:20.037
We're trying
to figure it out.

13:20.104 --> 13:22.172
Have you checked
with all the hospitals?

13:22.239 --> 13:23.506
Yes, we have.

13:23.574 --> 13:25.041
Well, what about the churches?
She could be there.

13:25.108 --> 13:26.241
We're covering the churches,
too, I promise you.

13:26.309 --> 13:27.543
So you just don't know
a damn thing.

13:27.610 --> 13:28.544
Mrs. Payton--

13:28.611 --> 13:29.932
you should be out there
right now.

13:29.946 --> 13:32.715
Even my husband is out there
looking, putting up flyers.

13:32.783 --> 13:36.886
How can you be looking
for her from in here?

13:36.953 --> 13:39.421
I understand
what you're going through.

13:39.489 --> 13:42.390
You don't understand
anything.

13:42.457 --> 13:44.693
No, I actually do.

13:44.760 --> 13:48.096
Maybe we can find a place
where we can talk.

13:48.164 --> 13:49.898
Agents, I'd like to help,

13:49.965 --> 13:52.934
but I can't disclose
the details of Tara's therapy.

13:53.002 --> 13:55.503
Frankly, I'm surprised she gave
me permission to talk to you.

13:55.571 --> 13:56.770
Dr. Berneman, Tara
is the only victim

13:56.838 --> 13:58.438
who's seen this man
and survived.

13:58.506 --> 13:59.639
There's two lives
at stake here.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.041
We're just trying
to get some insight.

14:01.109 --> 14:02.442
Well, I can tell you this--

14:02.510 --> 14:03.877
when Tara first came to me,

14:03.945 --> 14:05.813
she was suffering
from extreme PTSD.

14:05.880 --> 14:08.916
For lack of a better clinical
term, she was a hot mess.

14:08.983 --> 14:12.019
She would scratch at the burn
scars on her arm till they bled.

14:12.087 --> 14:13.520
She had insomnia,

14:13.545 --> 14:15.716
and when she did sleep,
she had nightmares.

14:18.092 --> 14:20.827
I noticed that she repeatedly
snapped a hair tie

14:20.894 --> 14:22.361
around her wrist.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.230
That's a form
of aversion therapy.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.766
When negative feelings
about the event start to take over,

14:26.834 --> 14:28.000
she snaps the rubber band.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.768
It helps her keep control.

14:29.836 --> 14:31.336
Call it a supplement
to a pretty strict regimen

14:31.403 --> 14:32.804
that helps her keep control.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.439
But she's got
a long way to go.

14:34.506 --> 14:36.608
Are you telling us that we
shouldn't be trying to question her?

14:36.675 --> 14:38.635
I'm telling you we worked
very hard for two years.

14:38.677 --> 14:41.146
Tara's finally
approaching normal.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.680
She's got a job.
She paints.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.149
She even had a date
last week.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.416
I would hate to put her
through anything

14:46.484 --> 14:47.517
that might set her back.

14:47.585 --> 14:49.220
All right, Doctor,
well, we appreciate

14:49.287 --> 14:51.055
you taking time
out of your vacation.

14:51.123 --> 14:52.689
Feel free to call
if you need anything else.

14:52.758 --> 14:53.958
Thank you, Doctor.

14:54.025 --> 14:55.945
It looks like we may need
to give Tara her space.

14:55.961 --> 14:58.181
Yeah, well, it's too bad,

14:58.206 --> 15:00.121
because she's the only
real lead we've got.

15:06.804 --> 15:08.828
I'm at a dead end.

15:08.853 --> 15:10.374
I spoke to the families
of the previous victims

15:10.375 --> 15:12.942
and they had nothing
to add to their original statements.

15:13.010 --> 15:14.866
Why hasn't he returned
Phoebe Payton yet?

15:14.891 --> 15:15.679
There has to be a reason.

15:15.680 --> 15:18.147
I hate to state the obvious,
but maybe he killed her.

15:18.214 --> 15:20.316
But why take the time,
effort, and risk

15:20.384 --> 15:23.352
to return all the other kids
just to kill this one?

15:23.420 --> 15:25.187
You know, she could have
succumbed to an asthma attack.

15:25.255 --> 15:27.590
Or we're looking
at this wrong.

15:27.658 --> 15:29.224
What if he's finally
found the kid

15:29.293 --> 15:30.926
he's really been
looking for?

15:30.994 --> 15:33.995
But we profiled him
as a sexual sadist with rage issues.

15:34.062 --> 15:36.498
The children have no value to him.
It's the nannies he wants.

15:36.565 --> 15:38.046
The first part of that
still could be right.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.167
Clearly he's a sadist.

15:39.168 --> 15:41.969
But what if the kids are more
valuable to him than the nannies?

15:42.037 --> 15:43.805
Then the nannies
are collateral damage

15:43.872 --> 15:45.673
in the hunt for what
he really wants--a child.

15:45.708 --> 15:47.074
And somehow Phoebe Payton
fits the bill.

15:47.142 --> 15:49.510
That explains why he abducted
her earlier than expected.

15:49.577 --> 15:51.044
Well, why wouldn't he
just grab the children, then?

15:51.112 --> 15:54.181
Because he's attracted to the
dynamic between nanny and child.

15:54.248 --> 15:55.683
It could also be a forensic
countermeasure.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.785
If he only took the children,
he would have left witnesses behind.

15:57.852 --> 15:59.353
But what's so special
about Phoebe?

15:59.421 --> 16:01.355
What makes her different
from the others?

16:05.926 --> 16:07.893
The asthma.

16:12.032 --> 16:13.633
Hallelujah,
this place is dead.

16:13.701 --> 16:15.134
♪ Give me a job,
give me a job ♪

16:15.202 --> 16:18.103
Garcia, I need you to check
the health records of all 5 kids

16:18.171 --> 16:22.308
that the unsub returned.
Any special needs, any medications.

16:22.375 --> 16:25.110
Okey-dokey artichokey.

16:28.048 --> 16:29.581
Uh...

16:31.784 --> 16:34.220
Everyone healthy as a horse.

16:34.287 --> 16:35.721
That's super healthy.
Clean bill. Nothing.

16:35.788 --> 16:37.256
Thanks, Garcia.

16:37.324 --> 16:38.200
Really? That's all?

16:38.225 --> 16:39.891
But I have so many
skills to help. Please?

16:39.892 --> 16:41.525
Hello?

16:41.593 --> 16:42.727
If his ultimate objective
is the kid,

16:42.794 --> 16:45.363
then he may abandon
his schedule altogether.

16:45.430 --> 16:47.131
Which means Gina may not
have until may 13.

16:47.199 --> 16:48.684
We need a targeted
media strategy.

16:48.709 --> 16:50.401
I'll go get Hotch.

16:50.402 --> 16:52.162
We believe we're looking
for a Caucasian male

16:52.171 --> 16:54.637
who's almost certainly
a resident of Los Angeles county.

16:54.705 --> 16:57.374
As you know, he operates
on a strict yearly schedule,

16:57.441 --> 16:59.243
which takes patience
and discipline.

16:59.310 --> 17:02.346
Which leads us to believe
he's in his late 30s or 40s.

17:02.413 --> 17:04.915
He abducts his victims
from public parks in broad daylight,

17:04.983 --> 17:07.351
which tells us that
he's socially competent,

17:07.417 --> 17:09.519
fits in,
appears non-threatening.

17:09.587 --> 17:11.553
In other words, he's someone
you'd never notice.

17:11.621 --> 17:13.722
Do you think he'll abduct
more victims anytime soon?

17:13.790 --> 17:16.525
It's possible, though
we find it highly doubtful.

17:16.593 --> 17:18.493
His schedule seems to be
very important to him.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.462
Then why hasn't he
returned the baby yet?

17:20.530 --> 17:22.765
We think he suffers from
a rare psychological disorder

17:22.832 --> 17:24.300
called paternal desire.

17:24.367 --> 17:26.300
Like its sister disorder,
maternal desire,

17:26.368 --> 17:29.137
it stems from a deep-seated
need to fill an emotional void

17:29.205 --> 17:30.772
left by the loss of a child.

17:30.839 --> 17:32.307
We think that loss
may be related

17:32.375 --> 17:34.842
to some kind of long-term
stressor in his life.

17:34.911 --> 17:37.312
And this explains why
he exhibits so much rage and violence

17:37.380 --> 17:38.846
against the nannies
that he abducts.

17:38.915 --> 17:41.149
He's shown little mercy
toward his adult victims,

17:41.217 --> 17:43.183
but he's been compassionate
to the children.

17:43.251 --> 17:46.086
And it's that sense
to which we'd like to appeal.

17:46.154 --> 17:48.923
At this point I'd like to introduce
Shane and Melody Payton.

17:48.990 --> 17:51.592
These are Phoebe's parents
and Gina's employers.

17:51.660 --> 17:53.260
Mr. and Mrs. Payton.

17:57.466 --> 18:00.834
Please...
If you're watching this

18:00.902 --> 18:03.937
or if you know the man
who did this,

18:04.004 --> 18:06.372
please contact
the authorities.

18:08.409 --> 18:11.545
Phoebe's just...

18:11.612 --> 18:13.914
she's just a baby.

18:13.981 --> 18:16.982
And our nanny, Gina,
she is a good person.

18:17.050 --> 18:18.818
She doesn't deserve this.

18:18.885 --> 18:22.087
Just do the right thing
and let them go, please.

18:22.155 --> 18:25.257
The baby has severe asthma

18:25.325 --> 18:27.225
and she needs this medication.

18:27.293 --> 18:30.728
She can't breathe without it.

18:31.864 --> 18:34.298
Please let them go.

18:34.366 --> 18:37.401
Give our baby back!

18:43.642 --> 18:44.642
We've issued an AMBER Alert

18:44.710 --> 18:45.910
and set up
a toll-free hotline.

18:45.945 --> 18:48.012
If anyone has any
information at all...

18:48.080 --> 18:51.482
Yeah, this is Derek Morgan.

18:51.549 --> 18:52.616
Yes.

18:52.684 --> 18:54.885
Can you hold on?

18:54.953 --> 18:57.254
Just a second.

18:58.256 --> 18:59.923
Go ahead.

19:01.826 --> 19:03.759
Really?

19:03.827 --> 19:05.661
That would be great.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.397
Ok. Thank you.

19:07.465 --> 19:09.499
That was Tara Rios.

19:09.566 --> 19:10.700
What happened?

19:10.767 --> 19:11.834
She wants to help us.

19:11.902 --> 19:13.069
You're kidding.

19:13.137 --> 19:15.105
She saw the press conference.

19:15.172 --> 19:18.375
JJ, good work.
It was your idea to go national.

19:18.442 --> 19:21.343
I'm gonna get them
to turn us around.

19:31.287 --> 19:33.088
I just wanted to let you know

19:33.156 --> 19:35.289
that we've convinced
a witness to come forward.

19:35.357 --> 19:36.891
She's a victim
who had escaped.

19:36.958 --> 19:39.894
I realize it's not the news
you're hoping for,

19:39.961 --> 19:41.996
but even the smallest
piece of information

19:42.064 --> 19:43.731
could help us find
Phoebe and Gina.

19:43.798 --> 19:45.633
In the meantime,
it would be a good idea

19:45.700 --> 19:48.369
if you could go home
and get some rest.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.405
It would do you some good.

19:51.472 --> 19:55.942
No, no, we're
not going anywhere.

19:59.312 --> 20:04.150
So, what makes you think
that it's gonna work this time?

20:04.217 --> 20:06.118
Well, we're gonna try
something new.

20:06.186 --> 20:08.254
It's a psychotherapy
called EMDR.

20:08.321 --> 20:11.024
It stands for eye movement
desensitization and reprocessing.

20:11.091 --> 20:12.490
It's very effective
with PTSD

20:12.559 --> 20:14.392
and memories that have been
buried especially deep.

20:14.460 --> 20:15.931
What if I can't?

20:15.956 --> 20:17.563
What if there's really
nothing in there?

20:17.564 --> 20:19.097
There's evidence
that suggests

20:19.165 --> 20:20.666
we process
intellectual material

20:20.733 --> 20:23.501
in a different part
of the brain than emotional material.

20:23.570 --> 20:26.638
EMDR helps link the two.

20:28.574 --> 20:32.142
Tara, we will be
with you the whole time.

20:32.210 --> 20:36.080
And you're gonna help us
catch this guy.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.449
I promise you.

20:45.155 --> 20:49.225
How does this...EMDR thing,
how does it work?

20:49.293 --> 20:52.862
First we'll start by putting you in
a safe place, mentally,

20:52.930 --> 20:55.865
by asking you to focus
on a particular image,

20:55.933 --> 20:57.567
a memory
that makes you happy.

20:57.635 --> 20:59.469
And then we'll start
asking questions.

20:59.536 --> 21:01.236
And then when you're ready,

21:01.304 --> 21:04.339
we'll have you follow
a light that moves side to side.

21:12.548 --> 21:15.984
So, can you tell us
about Jake?

21:16.051 --> 21:18.219
He was adorable.

21:18.286 --> 21:22.657
Big blue eyes.

21:22.725 --> 21:24.959
He was such a good boy.

21:25.027 --> 21:27.495
When was the last time
you saw him?

21:27.562 --> 21:30.732
That day. The day
that we got taken.

21:30.799 --> 21:34.935
We went to the park,
like we always did.

21:35.003 --> 21:36.903
Jake loved the park.

21:36.971 --> 21:38.672
What's the first
thing that comes to mind

21:38.740 --> 21:40.340
when you think
about that day?

21:50.283 --> 21:52.018
It was chilly.

21:52.085 --> 21:53.886
I forgot my coat.

21:53.954 --> 21:56.722
What can you tell us about
the abduction itself?

21:56.790 --> 22:00.259
It all
happened so quickly.

22:00.326 --> 22:04.029
That's ok.
Take your time.

22:14.874 --> 22:18.576
A man came up to us.
I think--

22:18.644 --> 22:21.178
I think he had
a leash in his hand.

22:21.245 --> 22:23.280
Did he have a dog?

22:24.215 --> 22:26.383
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

22:26.450 --> 22:29.586
That's good. You didn't
remember that before.

22:29.654 --> 22:32.823
Do you know
what kind of dog?

22:32.891 --> 22:36.092
No, but it was big.
I didn't--

22:36.160 --> 22:38.294
I didn't want it
near Jake.

22:39.730 --> 22:41.864
He said...

22:41.932 --> 22:44.734
He said Jake reminded him
of his baby sister.

22:44.802 --> 22:46.335
...my baby sister.

22:46.403 --> 22:49.438
You said before
he was a white guy.

22:49.506 --> 22:51.140
Can you see his face?

22:54.543 --> 22:56.578
No.

22:56.645 --> 22:59.280
But he has a gun
and he's--

22:59.348 --> 23:01.216
he's pointing it at Jake.

23:01.283 --> 23:02.984
Oh, God.

23:03.052 --> 23:05.220
Calm down.

23:05.287 --> 23:09.123
Just concentrate
on the light.

23:10.692 --> 23:13.728
What happened next?

23:15.563 --> 23:16.496
Ah!

23:16.564 --> 23:17.865
He hit me...

23:17.933 --> 23:20.901
in my face, then I fell.

23:22.204 --> 23:24.570
Jake was crying and...

23:24.638 --> 23:26.339
I couldn't help him.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.708
I couldn't do anything.

23:28.776 --> 23:30.744
I...I think I passed out.

23:30.811 --> 23:33.312
I...

23:33.380 --> 23:35.115
I...

23:38.853 --> 23:40.753
The burning...

23:41.821 --> 23:43.222
Woke me up.

23:46.359 --> 23:48.227
He was using cigarettes.

23:51.831 --> 23:54.733
I was tied to a bed.

23:56.735 --> 23:59.436
He kept saying,
"Can you take it?"

23:59.504 --> 24:01.078
And he said if I couldn't
take it that

24:01.103 --> 24:02.668
he was gonna
do it to Jake.

24:04.877 --> 24:05.910
Oh, my God.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.112
Ok. You're safe now,

24:08.180 --> 24:09.580
Tara.

24:11.449 --> 24:14.284
Jake, he won't stop crying.

24:16.954 --> 24:18.955
Help me. Help me.

24:20.224 --> 24:21.958
He says he needs help.

24:22.026 --> 24:24.460
You actually heard
the word "help"?

24:24.528 --> 24:25.728
Yeah.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.664
That can't be Jake, Tara.

24:27.731 --> 24:29.198
He's too little to talk.

24:29.266 --> 24:31.700
Help me! Help me.

24:31.768 --> 24:33.735
No, it was a woman.

24:34.871 --> 24:35.938
A woman?

24:36.006 --> 24:37.873
What woman?

24:39.309 --> 24:40.943
I don't know.

24:41.011 --> 24:43.412
Help me, please!

24:43.479 --> 24:45.579
I don't know!
I need to stop now.

24:45.647 --> 24:46.981
I need to stop.

25:06.649 --> 25:08.317
How you doing?

25:08.385 --> 25:10.585
You need anything?

25:13.823 --> 25:17.259
How could that stuff...

25:17.327 --> 25:21.162
be hidden in my head
all these years?

25:21.230 --> 25:23.364
I feel like
I'm going crazy.

25:23.432 --> 25:25.266
You're not.

25:25.334 --> 25:29.570
It's just your brain's way
of protecting you.

25:33.508 --> 25:35.977
That's them, isn't it?

25:36.045 --> 25:38.312
That little girl's
parents?

25:39.880 --> 25:42.149
Are they ok?

25:43.217 --> 25:45.485
Not so much.

25:47.155 --> 25:49.356
You have kids?

25:49.424 --> 25:51.291
Yeah. Yeah, a little boy,
Henry.

25:51.359 --> 25:52.559
How old is he?

25:52.626 --> 25:53.826
He's 4 1/2.

25:53.893 --> 25:56.963
Oh, that's a great age.

25:57.030 --> 25:59.365
Who's--who's
with him now?

25:59.433 --> 26:04.303
Uh, well, uh, right now
his dad is at work, so...

26:04.371 --> 26:07.073
He's with his nanny.

26:11.810 --> 26:14.512
This is working.

26:14.580 --> 26:16.948
But we've gotta keep going.

26:17.016 --> 26:19.484
The answers are in there.
I know it.

26:19.551 --> 26:22.620
But we're running out of time.

26:23.956 --> 26:28.525
Look, I made you a promise
that we would catch this guy.

26:28.593 --> 26:30.427
Please help me keep it.

26:44.475 --> 26:46.203
Ok, Tara, I want you

26:46.228 --> 26:48.178
to focus on the screams
of that woman.

26:48.845 --> 26:52.548
Where were you
when you heard them?

26:53.850 --> 26:56.785
Help me!
Help me, please!

26:56.853 --> 26:59.488
Help!

27:00.491 --> 27:01.957
It was when
he was burning me.

27:02.025 --> 27:03.191
Did you ever see her?

27:03.259 --> 27:05.227
No.

27:08.897 --> 27:10.265
Wait.

27:12.235 --> 27:14.669
Oh, my God, the van.

27:14.737 --> 27:17.772
The van--
she was there, too.

27:17.840 --> 27:18.706
Can you describe her?

27:18.774 --> 27:20.941
There's blood
in my eyes. Um...

27:21.009 --> 27:24.345
She was--she was wearing
a blue shirt.

27:26.014 --> 27:27.948
Was that the only time
that you saw her?

27:41.795 --> 27:44.964
I got out. I wanted
to search for Jake,

27:45.032 --> 27:48.067
but I couldn't hear him
crying anymore.

27:50.237 --> 27:51.570
I saw her.

27:51.638 --> 27:55.607
I saw her
in the bathroom...

27:55.675 --> 27:57.876
Tied to a sink.

27:59.546 --> 28:00.979
She had blond hair.

28:04.184 --> 28:06.051
And I...

28:07.119 --> 28:08.952
Roscoe, shut up!

28:20.532 --> 28:22.466
I left them there.

28:24.402 --> 28:26.002
I left them both there.

28:26.070 --> 28:28.327
Can you think of anything
else about her?

28:28.352 --> 28:29.372
Her name, maybe?

28:29.373 --> 28:31.007
Can you take it,
Alison?

28:31.075 --> 28:33.142
Alison.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.611
Her name was Alison.

28:34.679 --> 28:37.280
That's what he would call her
when he was hurting her.

28:44.521 --> 28:46.988
So if this mystery
blonde in blue

28:47.056 --> 28:49.191
was in the van with Tara,
that means the unsub

28:49.259 --> 28:50.926
probably grabbed them
on the same day.

28:50.993 --> 28:53.329
He's never taken more than
one woman at a time, though.

28:53.396 --> 28:54.717
Maybe she wasn't
part of the plan.

28:54.764 --> 28:56.531
JJ and Morgan are still
working with Tara.

28:56.599 --> 28:58.866
She thinks she might be able
to describe the unsub enough

28:58.934 --> 29:01.102
to get a composite sketch.

29:01.169 --> 29:02.303
What have you got, Garcia?

29:02.371 --> 29:03.538
What I've got
is a promotion coming,

29:03.606 --> 29:05.607
'cause, damn, I am good.

29:05.674 --> 29:09.143
A very blond Alison Astor
was reported missing 3 years ago.

29:09.149 --> 29:10.730
Now, she's from Dallas,
but she never returned home

29:10.755 --> 29:11.612
from a business trip

29:11.613 --> 29:13.280
she took to Los Angeles.
She was single,

29:13.348 --> 29:15.583
she worked as a sales rep
for a pharmaceutical company,

29:15.608 --> 29:17.217
she was an avid runner.
She even qualified

29:17.218 --> 29:18.898
for the Boston marathon,
which is not easy.

29:18.953 --> 29:20.520
All right, call the coroner's
office and see if there are

29:20.588 --> 29:22.856
any unidentified female remains
for the last 3 years.

29:22.923 --> 29:24.923
Um, sir, you're talking
to me. That's already done.

29:24.925 --> 29:27.793
It's L.A., so there are 12
unidentified female bodies,

29:27.861 --> 29:29.862
but only one with blond hair,
wearing a blue shirt,

29:29.929 --> 29:33.031
and the coroner is expecting
you, and you're welcome.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.635
Sorry about the wait.
She was way in the back

29:35.702 --> 29:37.570
and her possessions
were up in storage.

29:37.638 --> 29:39.138
Here's the report.

29:39.205 --> 29:41.641
She was scheduled
to be buried soon,

29:41.708 --> 29:43.608
but every day we I.D.
one of our Jane Does.

29:43.676 --> 29:46.711
You weren't able to determine
exact cause of death.

29:46.779 --> 29:48.346
Inconclusive.
She was too decomposed.

29:48.414 --> 29:51.816
Found in a shallow grave
up in a remote part of Griffith Park.

29:51.884 --> 29:54.386
So she was out there
at least a year before she was found.

29:54.453 --> 29:57.021
Critters must have
got to her, too.

29:57.089 --> 29:58.690
Yeah. They went to town.

29:58.758 --> 30:01.826
You can see bite marks
on her tibia, fibula.

30:01.894 --> 30:03.694
They're on her radius,
too.

30:03.762 --> 30:05.362
Something weird
on this leg.

30:05.430 --> 30:08.699
These bite marks here--
too big for anything

30:08.767 --> 30:10.067
out in Griffith Park.

30:10.135 --> 30:12.870
I'd say that's from
a very large dog,

30:12.938 --> 30:15.472
one pushing 100 pounds
or so.

30:21.946 --> 30:24.948
Let me help her.

30:25.016 --> 30:27.383
The nebulizer
is in my bag.

30:38.228 --> 30:42.464
The steam won't work.
She needs her medicine!

30:44.367 --> 30:46.302
He puts the nannies
on display,

30:46.369 --> 30:49.537
but he hides Alison Astor
in a remote shallow grave.

30:49.604 --> 30:51.739
Before Alison started
in pharmaceuticals,

30:51.807 --> 30:53.808
she was a corpsman
in the Navy.

30:53.876 --> 30:57.745
She probably witnessed
Tara's abduction and tried to intervene.

30:57.813 --> 30:59.914
It makes sense.
She was trained to help people.

30:59.982 --> 31:02.283
He hid her body
because Tara escaped.

31:02.351 --> 31:03.584
And the anniversary
means too much to him

31:03.652 --> 31:05.612
to have Alison's body
be the one to be discovered.

31:05.619 --> 31:07.787
Well, we got
our composite sketch.

31:07.856 --> 31:10.290
Hey, guys.

31:10.358 --> 31:12.025
Check this out.

31:12.093 --> 31:14.228
He grabbed his first
victims from here.

31:14.295 --> 31:16.696
He abducted Gina
and Phoebe from here.

31:16.764 --> 31:19.366
He buried Alison Astor
up here.

31:19.433 --> 31:22.534
And down here in Hollywood
is where Tara Rios was found passed out.

31:22.602 --> 31:24.203
We can give it another try,
but she has no idea

31:24.271 --> 31:26.672
where she escaped from
or how long she was wandering.

31:26.740 --> 31:29.375
I'm actually more intrigued by what
lies between these 4 points. Look.

31:29.442 --> 31:31.643
Dog parks.

31:31.711 --> 31:33.279
There's two of them.

31:33.347 --> 31:35.547
She did say he had a dog.

31:35.615 --> 31:37.916
And there were bite marks
on Alison Astor's leg.

31:37.984 --> 31:39.385
Dog owners tend to be
very regimented.

31:39.452 --> 31:40.612
They follow
a strict schedule.

31:40.653 --> 31:42.053
And being out with his dog
would allow him

31:42.121 --> 31:43.822
to inconspicuously
stalk his prey.

31:43.890 --> 31:45.190
Those parks
are extremely social.

31:45.258 --> 31:47.125
Someone out there
had to see this guy.

31:48.461 --> 31:49.928
Let me help her!

31:51.798 --> 31:52.897
Shut up.

31:52.964 --> 31:55.900
Don't pretend
that you care.

31:55.967 --> 31:58.636
Do whatever you want to me,

31:58.704 --> 32:00.838
but, please, she'll die.

Shh. Good girl.

32:23.961 --> 32:25.127
Give her back now.

32:25.194 --> 32:26.061
What?

32:26.129 --> 32:27.563
She's mine!
Give her to me.

32:27.631 --> 32:28.564
No.

32:28.632 --> 32:29.565
Roscoe, up!

32:29.633 --> 32:30.633
No!

32:32.736 --> 32:33.969
I'm not finished
with you yet.

32:34.037 --> 32:37.473
Please don't hurt her!

32:50.946 --> 32:52.929
Morgan, you and JJ canvas
the north end of the park,

32:52.930 --> 32:54.030
we'll take the south.

32:54.098 --> 32:55.864
We should make sure LAPD
covers playgrounds

32:55.932 --> 32:57.535
and walking trails as well.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.402
I suggest we go as far west
as Runyon Canyon.

32:59.403 --> 33:00.436
A lot of real estate.

33:00.504 --> 33:01.904
It'll be nightfall soon.

33:01.971 --> 33:03.472
If this guy is planning
on keeping the kid,

33:03.540 --> 33:06.442
there's a good chance he won't
even stick to his anniversary date.

33:08.378 --> 33:10.979
The FBI has released
a composite sketch

33:11.047 --> 33:12.327
of the so-called "Nanny Killer,"

33:12.381 --> 33:14.649
who's suspected of abducting
and brutally murdering

33:14.717 --> 33:17.719
4 young women up and down
the California coast

33:17.787 --> 33:18.986
over the past 6 years.

33:19.054 --> 33:20.322
His latest abductees,

33:20.389 --> 33:23.191
23-year old Gina Mendes and
2-year-old Phoebe Payton,

33:23.258 --> 33:25.660
both from Los Angeles,
still are missing.

33:25.728 --> 33:28.762
If you have any information
regarding their whereabouts,

33:28.830 --> 33:33.500
please call the AMBER Alert
hotline or the LAPD immediately.

33:33.568 --> 33:35.101
Yeah, that kind of
looks like Jonny.

33:35.169 --> 33:36.870
Do you know him?

33:36.938 --> 33:39.840
Yeah. I mean, not really,
just from up here, but...

33:39.907 --> 33:41.007
hang on.

33:41.075 --> 33:42.843
Hey, baby,
come here for a sec?

33:43.977 --> 33:46.412
He's up here more than I am.

33:46.480 --> 33:47.680
What's up?

33:47.748 --> 33:49.215
These guys
are with the FBI.

33:49.282 --> 33:51.718
Take a look at this.
That look like Jonny to you?

33:51.785 --> 33:54.053
Kinda. Yeah.

33:54.120 --> 33:55.455
Do you know where
we can find him?

33:55.522 --> 33:57.724
No idea. I used to see him
up here all the time.

33:57.791 --> 33:59.391
Haven't seen him
in a few days, though.

33:59.459 --> 34:00.692
What kind of dog
does he have?

34:00.760 --> 34:02.026
A big old Rottweiler.

34:02.094 --> 34:04.062
Roscoe.
He plays with Daisy.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.129
Do you know Jonny's
last name?

34:06.197 --> 34:07.965
No. Just Jonny.

34:08.032 --> 34:09.132
Sorry.

34:09.199 --> 34:10.634
Is he in some kind
of trouble?

34:10.702 --> 34:13.136
Oh, man of my favorite
fantasies, what you got?

34:13.204 --> 34:15.138
I need you to do
your thing, mama.

34:15.206 --> 34:17.139
Look up every Jonny, John, and
Jonathan in Los Angeles

34:17.208 --> 34:19.208
with a dog license.

34:19.277 --> 34:21.478
Ok, there are 420.

34:21.545 --> 34:23.446
Does it specify
what breed of dog?

34:23.514 --> 34:25.047
Yes. Unless
they're mixed breed.

34:25.114 --> 34:27.583
Are there any Rottweilers
on that list?

34:27.650 --> 34:29.485
Oh, hang on.
Not a one.

34:29.553 --> 34:31.433
Hang on. Not everybody bothers
to get a license.

34:31.521 --> 34:32.621
What about
vet records?

34:32.690 --> 34:33.723
What about them?

34:33.791 --> 34:35.123
Find all the veterinarian
offices

34:35.192 --> 34:36.693
within a 10-mile radius
of Griffith Park.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.460
This guy's got a Rottweiler.

34:38.527 --> 34:43.031
Ok, there are 14 vet offices,
there are a lot of records.

34:43.099 --> 34:45.766
It's gonna take me a sec.
Hold up, I'll hit you back.

34:55.844 --> 34:58.979
That was a good boy.

34:59.047 --> 35:00.481
Come here.

35:00.549 --> 35:02.350
Turn around.

35:02.418 --> 35:04.385
Good boy. Go.

35:33.513 --> 35:35.948
I got a hit.
There's a Jonathan Ray Covey

35:36.015 --> 35:38.451
who owns a 110-pound
Rottweiler named Roscoe.

35:38.518 --> 35:40.018
I've got a home
and a work address.

35:40.086 --> 35:41.287
Well, who's closer
to what?

35:41.355 --> 35:43.255
You're closer to home,

35:43.289 --> 35:44.889
which is right next to Griffith Park.
You're right there.

35:44.957 --> 35:46.758

37:18.145 --> 37:19.545
I got the skinny
on this Covey dude.

37:19.579 --> 37:21.939
He's 40 years old, he lives in the
same house he grew up in,

37:21.981 --> 37:24.421
which he inherited from his mother
when she died 10 years ago.

37:24.451 --> 37:26.418
That's why he's so connected
to Griffith Park.

37:26.486 --> 37:27.753
He probably grew up
going there.

37:27.821 --> 37:29.021
How did his mother die,
Garcia?

37:29.055 --> 37:31.457
Heart attack.
Same thing with his dad back in '86.

37:31.524 --> 37:33.925
And here's something super sad.
When Covey was 7,

37:33.993 --> 37:36.093
his 2-year-old sister
Amanda was drowned.

37:36.161 --> 37:37.094
How?

37:37.162 --> 37:38.929
Bathtub. There was
a nanny watching,

37:38.997 --> 37:40.732
a Griselda Vasquez.

37:40.799 --> 37:43.279
There was a full investigation.
The death was ruled accidental.

37:43.335 --> 37:44.869
She was cleared
of any wrongdoing.

37:44.936 --> 37:46.671
Covey must still blame her
for his sister's death.

37:46.739 --> 37:48.406
And guess what date
she died.

37:48.474 --> 37:49.607
May 13.

37:49.675 --> 37:50.608
Winner winner,
chicken dinner.

37:50.676 --> 37:52.343
And here's another
piece of interest.

37:52.410 --> 37:53.377
Baby sister had asthma.

37:53.444 --> 37:56.180
So this isn't
paternal desire,

37:56.248 --> 37:57.748
this is fraternal
desire.

37:57.815 --> 37:59.483
Oh, and peep this.
Griselda Vasquez,

37:59.550 --> 38:02.152
she lost her battle
with breast cancer 6 years ago.

38:02.220 --> 38:03.740
That's when he killed
his first victim.

38:03.788 --> 38:05.055
That must have been
his trigger.

38:05.123 --> 38:07.357
He never got his chance
to take revenge.

38:16.934 --> 38:18.368
Just give in.

38:20.304 --> 38:22.205
FBI!

38:27.143 --> 38:28.343
Jonathan Ray Covey,

38:28.411 --> 38:31.079
it's the FBI!

38:43.225 --> 38:45.259
His sister's room.

38:46.494 --> 38:47.761
Roscoe, attack!

38:51.666 --> 38:53.267
Drop the weapon!

38:53.335 --> 38:54.368
Let her go!
Roscoe!

38:54.436 --> 38:55.368
Drop the weapon!

38:56.537 --> 38:57.404
Jonathan, let her go.

38:57.471 --> 38:59.605
She's not Griselda!

38:59.673 --> 39:02.142
Griselda? That bitch lied
and got away with it!

39:02.209 --> 39:03.030
She didn't care about us.

39:03.055 --> 39:04.877
She just wanted to save
her own ass!

39:04.878 --> 39:06.879
But that girl right there
is not your nanny.

39:08.115 --> 39:10.317
Don't hurt that dog!

39:10.384 --> 39:12.251
Jonathan, let her go!

39:18.224 --> 39:20.292
He's gone out front!

39:29.501 --> 39:31.669
Stop!

39:38.243 --> 39:40.211
Stop right there!

39:57.496 --> 39:59.896
We've got it.

40:01.431 --> 40:02.899
You all right?

40:02.967 --> 40:04.100
Yeah.

40:04.167 --> 40:05.735
That was a nice shot.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.838
Agent Jareau?

40:13.143 --> 40:16.444
Tara, what are you
doing here?

40:16.513 --> 40:18.514
I asked them
to bring me.

40:19.816 --> 40:21.116
Baby.

40:21.183 --> 40:22.183
Come, baby.

40:22.251 --> 40:26.622
Oh...Oh, God.

40:28.257 --> 40:31.493
We got him.

40:31.560 --> 40:32.960
He's dead.

40:33.028 --> 40:36.296
And we saved Phoebe
and Gina, too.

40:36.364 --> 40:38.165
You did it.

40:48.009 --> 40:50.010
It's over.

40:53.614 --> 40:56.082
I want to see his body.

41:00.821 --> 41:02.789
Guys...

41:02.857 --> 41:04.590
Yeah.

41:12.465 --> 41:14.299

41:18.605 --> 41:21.439
