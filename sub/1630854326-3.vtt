WEBVTT

00:16.350 --> 00:17.351
Wow.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.895
This place hasn't changed.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.897
I've always wanted to come back here.

00:22.648 --> 00:23.690
Cool, cool.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.984
Now, tell me about
the place you don't wanna go to.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.110
What do you mean?

00:27.694 --> 00:29.154
There's no place like that.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.365
He means this place. Right here.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.450
I take back my lunch offer, Joe.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.661
You can wait in the car.
-Okay.

00:35.661 --> 00:38.205
Or join us, please.

00:38.205 --> 00:42.084
Come on, Uncle Máximo.
You're obviously avoiding something.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.210
Or someone.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.546
Really? Who is it?

00:47.673 --> 00:49.675
Our server is here.
I can't tell you right now.

00:50.843 --> 00:52.594
No, she's not.
-Don't call her over.

00:52.678 --> 00:58.559
I'll just have to answer
your question later.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.770
So, are you ready
to try ordering in Spanish?

01:01.854 --> 01:03.146
Sure.

01:05.858 --> 01:09.945
<i>La</i> cheeseburger. No bun.

01:10.696 --> 01:11.905
Cheeseburger?

01:11.989 --> 01:16.743
I fly you all the way down to my hometown
in Mexico and you order "<i>la</i> cheeseburger."

01:16.827 --> 01:18.787
I had Taco Bell yesterday.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.205
That-- That's not--

01:20.789 --> 01:22.666
We need another minute.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.587
Okay, back to my story.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.591
<i>See, Hugo, it was a tough time for me.</i>

01:30.591 --> 01:32.050
DO NOT DISTURB!

01:32.134 --> 01:35.220
<i>At home, Sara blamed my mom
for her breakup with Roberta.</i>

01:35.846 --> 01:39.266
<i>But since she couldn't talk about it,
she just stayed in her room.</i>

01:41.310 --> 01:44.438
<i>Things were still awkward
with me and Julia.</i>

01:46.732 --> 01:48.692
<i>And work wasn't any better,</i>

01:48.692 --> 01:52.404
<i>since Héctor was still taking
half my tips.</i>

01:54.531 --> 01:55.532
Thank you.

01:56.491 --> 01:59.536
<i>But there was one thing
I couldn't complain about.</i>

02:00.621 --> 02:01.622
Miss Isabel!

02:01.914 --> 02:03.582
What have you stolen on this fine day?

02:05.709 --> 02:06.668
Remote control?

02:07.336 --> 02:08.586
Why would you steal that?

02:08.794 --> 02:10.464
All that does is hurt the guests.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.299
At least give me the batteries.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.759
I'm hitting mute.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.219
Why isn't it working?

02:17.554 --> 02:20.557
Hey, I remember you mentioned
you like lucha libre.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.185
My parents have four tickets for tomorrow

02:23.185 --> 02:24.645
and my brothers can't go...

02:25.062 --> 02:25.896
Want to come?

02:34.196 --> 02:35.822
Yes! I love lucha libre!

02:35.906 --> 02:36.740
Fantastic!

02:36.949 --> 02:39.117
My parents will be excited
to finally meet you.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.539
Finally?

02:43.997 --> 02:45.249
"Finally"?

02:45.874 --> 02:46.834
Wow.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.044
I didn't realize
how serious you and Isabel are.

02:49.044 --> 02:49.878
I didn't either!

02:49.962 --> 02:51.171
We haven't even gone out yet.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.257
Why is she talking about me
to her parents?

02:53.632 --> 02:55.425
Because she likes you.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.261
I think that's sweet.

02:57.261 --> 02:58.345
Do you like her?

02:58.345 --> 02:59.429
Sure...

02:59.513 --> 03:00.764
She has three great qualities...

03:01.098 --> 03:02.182
beauty...

03:02.349 --> 03:03.350
personality...

03:03.809 --> 03:05.102
and lucha libre tickets.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.938
Can't I just go and have this not...

03:08.272 --> 03:09.106
be a big deal?

03:09.106 --> 03:10.107
Look...

03:10.440 --> 03:13.360
Isabel comes from a big family.
Just like mine.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.822
And when our family brings someone in,

03:16.822 --> 03:18.448
it can be a life sentence.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.869
Three years ago, one of my sisters
brought this guy

03:21.869 --> 03:22.828
Antonio

03:22.828 --> 03:24.663
...home to meet our parents.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.165
He hasn't left our house since.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.211
It's too early to meet her family.

03:32.045 --> 03:32.921
Unless...

03:33.297 --> 03:34.131
Okay!

03:34.131 --> 03:35.924
What if I wear a luchador mask
the whole time?

03:35.924 --> 03:37.176
Then-
-No!

03:37.301 --> 03:38.135
Stop!

03:38.135 --> 03:39.136
Bad Máximo!

03:39.344 --> 03:41.430
If you're not ready for something serious,

03:41.430 --> 03:42.890
you have to cancel the date.

03:44.850 --> 03:45.893
Yeah, you're right.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.813
I'll go to her restaurant tonight
to let her know.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.275
<i>Will the owner
of the whitest ass in Mexico</i>

03:53.275 --> 03:54.943
<i>please come to the front desk?</i>

03:55.903 --> 03:58.363
Who's messing with the PA?

03:59.823 --> 04:01.700
Hey. Not funny.

04:04.912 --> 04:09.208
<i>See, Chad's old fraternity brothers
heard he'd gotten engaged.</i>

04:09.208 --> 04:11.001
No way.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.045
<i>So they came down to surprise him.</i>

04:13.045 --> 04:15.339
Their names--
I can't remember their names,

04:15.339 --> 04:19.510
but they were five blond, white guys
who all went to USC.

04:19.510 --> 04:22.471
So, they were all basically Chads?

04:22.471 --> 04:26.183
Yeah, great idea. They're all Chads.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.478
Chad!
-Chad, baby!

04:29.478 --> 04:31.021
And Chad!

04:31.021 --> 04:34.066
No way! Chad!

04:34.066 --> 04:35.484
Sup, Chad?
-Sup, bro?

04:35.484 --> 04:36.818
Chad!
-Chad!

04:36.902 --> 04:39.196
I've known these guys since freshman year.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.698
Your fiancé here was a legend in college.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.575
I mean, we all called him "Rad Chad."

04:43.659 --> 04:45.410
Stop.
-All right? Fraternity president,

04:45.494 --> 04:49.206
beer pong champ, arm wrestling champ
and inventor of a game we like to call

04:49.206 --> 04:51.250
"Who can drink
the most beers in a minute?"

04:51.250 --> 04:52.584
Yes!

04:52.668 --> 04:55.379
It sounds like a complicated game.
-It's pretty simple. We would just--

04:55.379 --> 04:56.922
I was kidding.

04:56.922 --> 05:00.300
But now, these guys are all crushing it.
I mean, Chad is on Wall Street.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.177
Chad is also on Wall Street.

05:02.261 --> 05:06.765
And Chad spent a year trying to write
a sprawling, Proustian memoir of his life,

05:06.849 --> 05:09.268
but now he's on Wall Street.

05:09.268 --> 05:13.605
Meanwhile, dude, your life is like
a permanent vacation.

05:13.689 --> 05:15.607
It is crazy, though,
because we thought you'd be

05:15.691 --> 05:17.776
president by now or something.
-Oh, I mean, you know,

05:17.860 --> 05:19.486
my life is still pretty intense.

05:19.570 --> 05:22.114
I'm basically, you know,
running this entire resort.

05:22.114 --> 05:23.198
Chad.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.618
Your mom has a very, very, very, very
important job for you.

05:26.702 --> 05:29.580
She needs you to take her dress
back to the dry cleaners.

05:29.580 --> 05:32.583
They apparently-- They didn't get rid of
the red wine stain.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.501
She also said, and I quote,

05:34.585 --> 05:37.838
"Don't let Manuel bully you again.
You have to be stern with him."

05:42.843 --> 05:44.511
Fries are on the way.
-Thank you.

05:44.595 --> 05:47.598
Máximo! Hey.
I need you to make me look good.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.225
Okay, first you need to get some sun.

05:50.309 --> 05:52.519
Your skin is a bit too--
-No, I mean in front of my friends.

05:53.812 --> 05:57.566
I'm sorry I can't help right now.
But I know the perfect person who can.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.193
Memo.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.196
Chad needs your help to look good.

06:02.196 --> 06:05.115
Oh, okay. First of all, you need more sun.

06:05.199 --> 06:09.494
No, I'm not that-- My skin is sensitive
and I-- Never mind, okay?

06:09.578 --> 06:12.414
I just want you to talk me up
in front of my friends.

06:13.749 --> 06:16.418
I don't know. Groups of guys scare me.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.629
Probably 'cause
I grew up with five sisters

06:19.129 --> 06:20.380
who also scare me.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.633
Oh, come on. You'll be great.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.595
Don't worry, this is your superpower.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.096
Making the hero look good.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.308
You're the guy behind the guy.

06:31.308 --> 06:34.228
Now get in there and say some stuff
about Chad you don't believe.

06:37.022 --> 06:40.901
Wow, it's like you have an unlimited
supply of stories of people throwing up.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.736
Yeah.
-Hell yeah.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.155
Okay. Well, I should get back to work.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.115
It was really nice talking to all of you.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.325
Enjoy.
-Take care.

06:48.325 --> 06:51.411
Guys, this is my <i>amigo</i>, Memo. My "Memigo."

06:51.495 --> 06:52.329
Memo.

06:52.329 --> 06:57.000
Memo, this is Chad, Chad, Chad,
Chad, and Chad.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.460
Hi.

06:58.544 --> 07:00.879
Wow, I hope I can remember
all of your names.

07:09.555 --> 07:12.891
Don Pablo, how were
your first few days off in 20 years?

07:12.975 --> 07:14.142
Wonderful.

07:14.893 --> 07:18.689
My grandson, every time I make this face...

07:20.357 --> 07:21.900
Oh, you don't care.

07:21.984 --> 07:22.985
No.

07:22.985 --> 07:25.779
You know the final walk-through
for our investor Ricardo Vera?

07:25.863 --> 07:28.448
Where his representative tells us
the last changes they want

07:28.532 --> 07:31.910
before he puts millions into this place?
-Yes. The walk-through's tomorrow.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.204
Actually, his rep showed up today.

07:34.288 --> 07:37.291
And since you weren't here,
someone else escorted him around.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.920
If it wasn't you and it wasn't me,
who was it?

07:42.004 --> 07:43.297
Paco the maintenance guy.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.425
Hey, you need something, man?

07:47.134 --> 07:51.013
Yes, I work for Mr. Vera,
the hotel's new investor.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.931
I'm here for the walkthrough.

07:53.432 --> 07:54.725
Oh, cool.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.311
I can show you around.

07:57.644 --> 07:58.478
Chip?

07:59.813 --> 08:03.734
On their tour, Paco agreed
to an overhaul of the cabana menu,

08:03.734 --> 08:05.944
he conceded in cutting my travel expenses,

08:06.028 --> 08:09.781
negotiated a 20% raise
in the maintenance budget,

08:09.865 --> 08:12.201
and then at the pool...

08:20.751 --> 08:21.793
Another thing...

08:22.294 --> 08:23.128
Mr. Vera

08:23.253 --> 08:25.255
does not care for this gimmick

08:25.422 --> 08:27.299
of U.S. pop songs being sung in Spanish.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.259
Classical music would be more appropriate.

08:30.135 --> 08:34.640
<i>Remember my name. Fame!
I'm gonna live forever...</i>

08:36.099 --> 08:37.058
You're fired!

08:37.643 --> 08:39.061
<i>I'm gonna learn how to fly...</i>

08:39.352 --> 08:40.395
<i>high...</i>

08:40.395 --> 08:42.688
Diane, this was a mistake, right?

08:42.773 --> 08:45.067
Paco and the guy in the lame suit
said we're fired.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.235
We need this job.

08:46.235 --> 08:49.321
I don't want to lose you either.
We'll talk to him as soon as we can.

08:49.321 --> 08:52.324
In the meantime,
I'll find you another job here.

08:52.324 --> 08:53.700
Oh, thank you, Don Pablo.

08:53.784 --> 08:56.495
We'd be happy to work anywhere.
-Yeah.

08:59.331 --> 09:00.874
Get to work.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.263
No!

09:14.263 --> 09:15.764
No harmonizing!

09:15.889 --> 09:17.266
No fun!

09:19.226 --> 09:21.645
Hey, Mom! Esteban!

09:25.941 --> 09:26.942
What's the matter?

09:28.151 --> 09:30.863
Nothing... your mom and your sister
just had a disagreement.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.574
Now she's hiding in her room
and won't come out.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.158
Your sister, not your mother.

09:35.158 --> 09:35.993
Your mother's right here.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.580
Esteban, do you mind taking care
of that job I asked you about?

09:39.580 --> 09:41.123
Mom, let him eat!

09:41.123 --> 09:43.667
No, no, no... I'm full anyway.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.670
Soup expands in the stomach.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.383
You treat him like a worker
instead of your boyfriend.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.051
What do you even want that hook for
anyway?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.720
You know what they say...

09:54.928 --> 09:57.764
Better to have a hook and not need it

09:57.764 --> 09:59.808
than to need a hook and not have it.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.226
Nobody says that!

10:01.518 --> 10:02.352
Nobody.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.270
What do you mean?

10:03.270 --> 10:04.271
I just said it now.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.190
Now it turns out that I am nobody.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.069
Then he outran that giant boulder.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.323
And even though Chad is scared of snakes,

10:14.323 --> 10:17.784
he jumped into the snake pit anyway
and saved the girl.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.205
Dude, stop.
You're embarrassing me. Come on.

10:21.872 --> 10:22.998
All right. Be right back.

10:22.998 --> 10:25.918
Boss man's gotta go fire some dudes
on the kitchen staff.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.839
"Boss man's gotta go fire some dudes
on the kitchen staff."

10:32.925 --> 10:33.926
What did you say?

10:34.551 --> 10:36.345
Nothing, nothing. I was just kidding.

10:36.345 --> 10:39.389
No, no. That sounded exactly like him.

10:39.473 --> 10:40.474
Say it again.

10:42.184 --> 10:45.354
"Boss man's gotta go fire some dudes
on the kitchen staff."

10:47.105 --> 10:48.815
Oh, no way.
-Well, actually,

10:48.899 --> 10:51.818
if you want to do it right,
you have to add the hair flip at the end.

10:51.902 --> 10:53.612
"Hey, I'm Chad.

10:53.612 --> 10:56.281
My mom looks super hot in spandex.

10:56.365 --> 10:59.076
The double-popped collar
is what makes the collars pop."

11:01.578 --> 11:04.873
Come on, bro!
-That was awesome! Stellar!

11:12.881 --> 11:15.092
Isabel, you are very cool and very pretty.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.928
But I need to cancel our date tomorrow.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.847
I'm not ready to meet your parents.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.724
I'm not looking for something
that serious.

11:32.276 --> 11:34.278
Wait, that's this restaurant.

11:34.278 --> 11:35.404
That's right.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.240
The restaurant where Isabel worked.

11:39.074 --> 11:41.785
I just had to find her and cancel our date

11:41.869 --> 11:44.538
so I wouldn't have to meet her family
the next night.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.336
Oh no, Máximo!

11:51.712 --> 11:53.422
That's not the greeting I was expecting.

11:53.422 --> 11:56.008
It's a busy night
and our dishwasher is out sick.

11:56.008 --> 11:57.426
And before you ask...

11:58.552 --> 12:00.345
Yes. I was banned from waitressing.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.597
Why were you banned?

12:01.763 --> 12:02.931
This idiot guest was--

12:03.140 --> 12:04.558
Never mind, I know the answer.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.227
Okay.

12:08.270 --> 12:09.104
Isabel...

12:09.605 --> 12:10.814
You are very cool--

12:10.814 --> 12:11.732
Isabel!

12:11.732 --> 12:13.442
Is that Máximo?

12:13.650 --> 12:14.568
It must be.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.987
He's got that boyish
deer-in-the-headlights look

12:16.987 --> 12:18.405
you described!

12:18.906 --> 12:20.407
Who is that man that looks like you?

12:20.866 --> 12:21.783
Oh, that's my dad!

12:22.910 --> 12:24.703
This is my family's restaurant.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.331
This is your family's restaurant?

12:27.456 --> 12:28.707
Mercedes! Come.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.168
Everyone! Come and meet Máximo!

12:31.835 --> 12:32.753
Actually, I should really--

12:32.753 --> 12:35.047
That's my mom Mercedes, my aunt Raquel,

12:35.047 --> 12:37.341
my brothers Flaquito and Giraffe
are waiters...

12:37.382 --> 12:38.800
and those are my uncles...

12:38.800 --> 12:39.843
cousins and...

12:39.885 --> 12:43.013
my grandma Marina sits in the corner
and hisses at people.

12:45.098 --> 12:45.933
Wow.

12:46.683 --> 12:47.601
She likes you.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.188
Welcome to the family.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.106
This girl here is spoiled.

12:54.483 --> 12:56.527
So you'd better be serious about her.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.696
Hold on, Máximo wanted
to tell me something.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.200
So, go ahead...

13:12.042 --> 13:12.918
Save it.

13:12.918 --> 13:15.754
She can't talk
until she's done washing the dishes.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.423
Let's go! Back to work! Hurry up.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.384
We should just talk tomorrow on our date.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.221
Let me help with those dishes!

13:25.556 --> 13:27.850
It was the employees' Christmas dinner,

13:27.850 --> 13:29.935
and I was on kind of two dates at once.

13:29.935 --> 13:32.771
Both girls were very into me.

13:32.855 --> 13:34.606
Oh, you dog!
-All right, man.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.275
Memo!

13:37.693 --> 13:40.612
Hey, guys.
-Oh, dude, Memo here is the best.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.323
The best!
Hey, tell us another hilarious story.

13:43.407 --> 13:45.576
Okay, so this one time, Chad asked

13:45.576 --> 13:47.703
if Spain was the capital of Mexico.
-Beer pong!

13:47.703 --> 13:50.163
Hey, it's time for some beer pong!
-Yes!

13:50.247 --> 13:51.707
Yeah! Come on!
-Let's go!

13:52.749 --> 13:56.420
Beer pong! Beer pong!
Beer pong! Beer pong!

13:58.297 --> 14:00.424
So, has your family always had this place?

14:00.674 --> 14:04.428
No, when I was growing up, we actually
had a restaurant in San Diego.

14:04.553 --> 14:05.512
But...

14:05.512 --> 14:06.889
things got complicated.

14:07.723 --> 14:09.308
And we missed Acapulco.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.393
So we moved back here.

14:11.435 --> 14:14.146
Oh wow, you lived in the U.S.?

14:14.396 --> 14:15.230
That's so cool.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.066
We're much happier here,

14:18.692 --> 14:20.027
This is home.

14:20.777 --> 14:24.239
I can't believe your family spends all day
with each other and still gets along.

14:24.323 --> 14:26.617
My family can't even eat soup together.

14:29.703 --> 14:32.998
Okay,
I know you love spending time with me,

14:32.998 --> 14:35.167
but you've already washed that dish twice.

14:36.126 --> 14:38.504
Want to tell me what's going on?

14:39.379 --> 14:40.214
Oh, right...

14:41.089 --> 14:41.965
Isabel...

14:41.965 --> 14:42.799
you are very cool and very--

14:42.799 --> 14:43.759
We have a problem.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.970
Luisa slipped and hurt her ankle.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.264
So we're down a server.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.350
I could cover for her, Dad.

14:51.517 --> 14:53.519
But you're so mean to the guests.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.896
Only the stupid ones
who don't deserve to eat.

14:55.896 --> 14:56.730
You see? No.

14:58.607 --> 14:59.733
Or I could do it.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.026
It's what I do all day.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.110
I'd be happy to help.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.531
Who do I trust more...

15:05.864 --> 15:06.865
...my daughter?

15:07.324 --> 15:09.243
Or someone I just met today?

15:12.412 --> 15:13.705
Here is your pozole.

15:14.456 --> 15:15.290
Enjoy.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.050
Flaquito, I'll take that.

15:25.050 --> 15:25.884
Thanks.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.473
Come on.

15:31.557 --> 15:33.392
Eat it, Chad!
-Come on! Come on, bro!

15:33.392 --> 15:34.852
So fast!

15:35.853 --> 15:37.729
Chad, you got this. One cup.

15:37.813 --> 15:39.439
Hey, you look down. Want a beer?

15:39.523 --> 15:42.067
No, thanks. I'm just kind of bummed.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.278
I was having a lot of fun
being in the spotlight,

15:44.278 --> 15:45.737
but now Chad took all the att--

15:45.821 --> 15:47.531
Hey, you look down. Want a beer?

15:47.531 --> 15:50.993
Yes! Rad Chad does it again!
-There he is.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.202
Yeah!

15:52.286 --> 15:54.955
"I call myself 'Rad Chad' to you guys,

15:54.955 --> 15:58.667
but deep down, I call myself 'Sad Chad'
because my glory days are behind me

15:58.667 --> 16:01.336
and my only friends
are on my mommy's payroll."

16:03.422 --> 16:06.425
Burn!
-Memo, you're <i>en fuego</i>!

16:06.425 --> 16:09.428
That means "on fire."
We just learned that.

16:10.053 --> 16:13.056
Hey, Memo. Would you mind teaching me
a new word in Spanish?

16:15.434 --> 16:18.395
Thanks for all your help,
but do you mind maybe backing off a bit?

16:18.395 --> 16:21.315
Oh, I'm sorry.
-No, it's fine. It's just...

16:21.315 --> 16:23.901
I asked you to help me look good
in front of my friends.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.528
I know you're imitating me as a tribute,

16:26.612 --> 16:29.531
but I'm worried they might think
you're mocking me.

16:29.615 --> 16:32.618
I know,
but I'm always the guy behind the guy.

16:32.618 --> 16:33.994
What?

16:33.994 --> 16:35.913
The best friend helping out the hero.

16:36.455 --> 16:39.166
I guess it was kind of fun
to be the star for once.

16:39.917 --> 16:42.085
Wait, so does that mean
you're not gonna back off?

16:43.045 --> 16:44.755
Dudes, we've been talking.

16:44.755 --> 16:48.759
We're placing bets on who we think
would win at arm wrestling. You or Memo.

16:48.759 --> 16:49.968
Sure.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.972
I can beat most of my sisters
in arm wrestling.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.517
Weird way to psych me out. I'm in.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.480
It's perfect.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.731
Thank you, Esteban.

17:02.981 --> 17:06.068
Of course. Now you have a hook,
even if you don't need a hook.

17:07.778 --> 17:09.195
Oh, but I do need this hook.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.618
You've been here enough times...

17:16.203 --> 17:19.164
and kept your hat on enough times...

17:20.499 --> 17:21.875
that it deserves...

17:22.416 --> 17:23.460
its own spot.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.046
May I?

17:27.881 --> 17:29.299
That's your hook now.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.387
Nora, this is...

17:38.642 --> 17:40.018
My mom used to say...

17:40.853 --> 17:41.854
"Be patient Esteban."

17:42.312 --> 17:44.815
"Love will come with time. And a hook."

17:45.482 --> 17:46.608
And now...

17:47.192 --> 17:48.527
You've made me part of this home.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.406
I will not let you down. Ever.

18:01.707 --> 18:07.129
Maybe I can start
leaving my hat here overnight.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.590
Let's not get carried away.

18:09.840 --> 18:10.674
Ah, yes.

18:28.817 --> 18:32.196
If this is what they play in heaven,
I'm glad I'm not going.

18:34.615 --> 18:36.033
It's bad for business.

18:37.242 --> 18:40.078
Instead of drinking,
the guests are falling asleep.

18:40.537 --> 18:44.416
I'm sorry, but Mr. Vera said
no more U.S. pop songs in Spanish.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.251
No Exception.

18:47.419 --> 18:49.755
How about a compromise?

18:49.755 --> 18:53.967
You convince Mr. Vera
to accept a small change, and we--

18:55.636 --> 18:59.890
we make sure your wife
doesn't find out about your affair.

19:01.642 --> 19:02.601
Oh...

19:02.601 --> 19:03.519
Well...

19:03.519 --> 19:05.812
I think I'll go talk to Mr. Vera.

19:06.438 --> 19:07.481
Excuse me.

19:09.942 --> 19:12.319
How did you know he was having an affair?

19:12.861 --> 19:13.987
I didn't.

19:16.365 --> 19:18.742
There you go.
-Nice. Stretches.

19:18.742 --> 19:20.494
That's the main thing.
-It's important.

19:20.494 --> 19:22.913
Yeah, but he's gotta get ready.

19:22.913 --> 19:24.122
Come on!

19:30.379 --> 19:33.257
What's going on here?
-Arm wrestling. It's important.

19:33.257 --> 19:35.467
Yeah.
-Those four words have never been used

19:35.551 --> 19:37.553
in all of human history. Come here.
-Hey!

19:38.846 --> 19:40.430
What's really going on?

19:41.014 --> 19:43.559
I guess I'm just trying to look like
I'm doing great in life

19:43.559 --> 19:46.937
because sometimes I don't feel like I am,
and I wish I was more like these guys.

19:46.937 --> 19:48.480
I don't.

19:48.564 --> 19:51.024
When I first met you,
you were exactly like them.

19:51.692 --> 19:55.362
But now you're more experienced,
more thoughtful,

19:55.362 --> 19:57.823
and more engaged to be married
than any of them.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.242
And you know more Spanish.

20:01.869 --> 20:04.162
I said, "And you also"--
-No, I got it.

20:04.830 --> 20:05.831
I did.

20:06.665 --> 20:08.542
<i>That's when Chad realized</i>

20:08.542 --> 20:11.670
<i>maybe he'd gotten a lot further in life
than he thought.</i>

20:16.049 --> 20:18.969
<i>And so, Chad decided to let Memo win.</i>

20:19.469 --> 20:23.932
<i>Unfortunately,
Memo had the exact same idea.</i>

20:24.016 --> 20:25.475
And go!

20:26.268 --> 20:27.603
Go, Chad.

20:27.603 --> 20:28.854
Come on.

20:33.317 --> 20:34.568
Why aren't you trying?

20:34.568 --> 20:38.405
I'm letting you win. You need this more.
I'm the guy behind the guy.

20:38.405 --> 20:42.326
Not today. Today you're the guy
in front of the guy behind the guy.

20:42.910 --> 20:44.703
I'm gonna make you beat me.

20:45.996 --> 20:47.164
Not if I can help it.

20:48.707 --> 20:51.835
So, what that means is--
-That's right, Hugo!

20:51.919 --> 20:54.046
It was a reverse arm wrestle.

20:54.046 --> 20:55.172
Oh, you're really strong.

20:55.172 --> 20:57.132
I thought you said
you lost to your sister.

20:57.216 --> 20:58.509
Yeah, the one that's a nun.

20:58.509 --> 20:59.843
She's got God on her side.

20:59.927 --> 21:01.970
And biceps like bowling balls.

21:02.054 --> 21:06.391
Oh, you're so strong!
-I'm not! I'm really not!

21:06.475 --> 21:08.435
I'm so weak and you're stronger!
-You're so strong!

21:08.519 --> 21:10.979
Oh, Memo, you're hurting my elbow!

21:11.063 --> 21:12.773
Chad. Chad.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.943
Oh, I lost!

21:16.527 --> 21:17.653
Memo!

21:18.487 --> 21:20.155
Shots.
-Shots, baby!

21:20.239 --> 21:21.865
Shots!
-You guys go celebrate.

21:21.949 --> 21:23.617
I'll be right behind you.

21:23.617 --> 21:24.701
Thank you.

21:26.912 --> 21:29.665
Chad was feeling better
about his life at Las Colinas,

21:30.165 --> 21:32.626
but as I helped Isabel and her family,

21:33.502 --> 21:34.503
I felt as if--

21:35.420 --> 21:38.507
as if I'd stumbled into
another life altogether.

21:50.602 --> 21:52.020
Perfect. I'll take these two.

21:54.773 --> 21:55.732
That's it.

21:55.816 --> 21:56.733
Thank you.

21:59.152 --> 22:00.195
Two flans.

22:04.616 --> 22:05.742
Here you go.

22:06.869 --> 22:07.703
Thank you.

22:24.261 --> 22:25.762
Oh, you don't have to pay me.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.931
We pool our tips and split them.

22:28.015 --> 22:29.391
Don't you do that at Las Colinas?

22:30.267 --> 22:31.101
No.

22:32.102 --> 22:34.813
In fact,
I have to give half my tips to my boss.

22:35.230 --> 22:37.024
This is nothing like my job.

22:37.858 --> 22:38.901
Or my family.

22:39.193 --> 22:41.361
Thank you for making me feel
so welcome today.

22:42.487 --> 22:43.655
Quite the contrary.

22:44.364 --> 22:46.074
Thank you for all your help.

22:46.074 --> 22:47.993
You earned it, right?

22:48.452 --> 22:49.286
Cheers!

23:27.241 --> 23:28.367
Adriana! Augusto!

23:28.659 --> 23:29.826
You're going back to the pool.

23:29.826 --> 23:30.661
Yes!

23:30.661 --> 23:32.412
I was getting so pale!

23:32.704 --> 23:34.081
One favor for Mr. Vera...

23:34.623 --> 23:37.459
Sometimes, why don't you play
a Mexican pop song...

23:37.459 --> 23:38.293
in English?

23:39.461 --> 23:40.295
Let's go.

24:24.882 --> 24:26.842
I'm glad it's resolved.

24:26.842 --> 24:30.345
I just wish you had been here.
Then this problem would've never happened.

24:30.429 --> 24:34.183
He showed up a day early.
And I was visiting my family.

24:34.183 --> 24:37.978
I know.
But let's not have this happen again.

24:45.152 --> 24:46.737
Hey, guys.
-Hey.

24:47.654 --> 24:51.491
I just wanted to say thanks for today,
Chad. I really appreciate it.

24:52.367 --> 24:54.203
Don't mention it. I had fun too.

24:55.412 --> 24:58.665
You know, I realized I don't need to worry
about what Chad thinks about me.

24:58.749 --> 25:02.920
Or Chad. Or Chad, or Chad, or even Chad.

25:03.837 --> 25:06.798
I only need to worry about
what one person thinks about me.

25:06.882 --> 25:08.050
And that's Chad.

25:17.309 --> 25:18.685
I had fun tonight.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.856
Although it's weird that you wanted
to meet my family so fast.

25:24.608 --> 25:26.151
<i>So much of happiness</i>

25:26.235 --> 25:29.363
<i>is about finding that place
where you feel like you belong.</i>

25:30.989 --> 25:33.700
<i>Esteban always knew
that place was with Nora.</i>

25:34.826 --> 25:37.788
<i>And tonight,
he learned that Nora felt the same.</i>

25:39.373 --> 25:42.417
<i>Chad realized he was happier now
than he'd ever been.</i>

25:44.086 --> 25:48.006
<i>For Don Pablo,
that place had always been the hotel.</i>

25:48.507 --> 25:51.218
<i>But suddenly, he wasn't so sure.</i>

25:52.761 --> 25:57.266
<i>And I might have found the place
I belonged when I wasn't even looking.</i>

25:57.266 --> 25:58.350
Hey--

25:59.309 --> 26:00.811
Didn't you want to tell me something?

26:01.520 --> 26:02.354
Oh right...

26:02.771 --> 26:04.439
Yes. I did.

26:06.483 --> 26:07.484
Isabel...

26:07.776 --> 26:09.695
you are very cool and very pretty...

26:10.112 --> 26:11.154
and...

26:11.780 --> 26:14.408
I'm excited for our date tomorrow.

26:16.201 --> 26:17.244
Me too.

26:45.147 --> 26:47.232
Now in Spanish!

27:36.573 --> 27:40.202
The applause is for you, fine audience.

27:40.202 --> 27:42.120
Thank you, Las Colinas!
