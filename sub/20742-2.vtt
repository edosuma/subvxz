00:01.447 --> 00:02.229
Who are you?

00:02.221 --> 00:03.460
Marco Ruiz.

00:04.011 --> 00:05.443
Chihuahua State Police.

00:05.443 --> 00:06.726
Who are you?

00:06.968 --> 00:08.548
Sonya Cross.

00:08.916 --> 00:10.182
El Paso Homicide.

00:10.206 --> 00:11.363
Whoa!

00:12.580 --> 00:14.580
Oh, shit!

00:18.363 --> 00:20.443
White arms, brown legs.

00:20.563 --> 00:22.461
There were two women on the bridge.

00:22.485 --> 00:24.026
Two different women.

00:24.034 --> 00:25.613
- Cut in half?
- Yes.

00:25.621 --> 00:27.615
Do you have a girl that
matches this description?

00:27.623 --> 00:31.439
Cristina Fuentes is only one of 250 girls

00:31.486 --> 00:33.434
who disappeared last year.

00:33.457 --> 00:35.334
So you have a serial killer.

00:47.913 --> 00:50.811
There are five murders a year in El Paso.

00:50.931 --> 00:52.938
In Juarez, thousands.

00:53.058 --> 00:56.082
Why is one dead white woman more important

00:56.095 --> 00:58.561
than so many dead just across the bridge?

00:58.584 --> 01:00.383
What's in there?

01:29.621 --> 01:30.909
What is it?

01:30.953 --> 01:32.017
It's a tunnel.

01:32.635 --> 01:33.675
Where does it go?

01:33.795 --> 01:34.763
Across.

01:34.782 --> 01:36.146
To Mexico.

01:38.079 --> 01:39.937
Karl was running drugs?

01:40.343 --> 01:42.167
No, señora. Illegals.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.028
I... I need to see it.

01:44.529 --> 01:46.869
Cesar, I need to see it.

01:49.321 --> 01:50.635
O____

01:53.596 --> 01:54.733
W___

02:05.901 --> 02:07.640
Who else knows about this?

02:07.709 --> 02:09.104
Nobody.

02:09.601 --> 02:11.781
Just Señor Karl and, uh...

02:12.296 --> 02:13.772
Who's on the other side?

02:13.810 --> 02:15.136
I don't know.

02:16.001 --> 02:18.671
I know this wasn't Karl's idea.

02:19.428 --> 02:20.736
We should go back.

02:20.856 --> 02:23.032
It's not good to be down in here.

02:45.288 --> 02:47.114
What is that?

02:47.490 --> 02:48.797
It's an altar.

02:53.646 --> 02:55.536
What is it doing here?

02:57.312 --> 02:58.977
Somebody died.

03:01.817 --> 03:03.012
Here?

03:03.056 --> 03:04.295
Sí, señora.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.685
There was an accident.

03:20.925 --> 03:22.264
Just get rid of it.

03:22.958 --> 03:24.228
Board it up.

03:24.348 --> 03:26.055
I don't think that's a good idea, señora.

03:26.112 --> 03:28.351
Please, Cesar, I can't
deal with this right now.

03:57.389 --> 03:59.059

Let's go!

¡Vámonos!

04:30.873 --> 04:32.799
Fin del camino, folks.

04:32.835 --> 04:34.115
This is as far as I go.

04:34.235 --> 04:35.900
Adios, amigos.

04:36.020 --> 04:37.867
T___

04:38.499 --> 04:39.625
How 'bout this deal,

04:39.619 --> 04:41.822
I don't scatter your
brains all over the desert?

04:41.884 --> 04:42.998
¿Comprende?

04:43.486 --> 04:45.876
Do it the old-fashioned way and walk.

06:24.635 --> 06:27.018
What would you do if
you were locked in a car

06:27.043 --> 06:28.007
with a bomb

06:28.702 --> 06:30.353
and had five minutes to live?

06:30.760 --> 06:32.882
He didn't have five minutes to live.

06:33.389 --> 06:35.553
No, just imagine.

06:35.822 --> 06:37.061
What would you do?

06:37.118 --> 06:38.669
Would you pray for a miracle?

06:38.789 --> 06:40.947
Would you make right with your life?

06:41.685 --> 06:42.893
I'd try to get out.

06:42.949 --> 06:44.200
Yeah, but boom!

06:44.801 --> 06:46.295
The bomb goes off.

06:48.429 --> 06:50.512
Well, five minutes wouldn't make much

06:50.544 --> 06:52.238
of a difference then, would they?

06:52.358 --> 06:53.590
Hmm.

06:54.197 --> 06:55.675
You want some?

06:56.657 --> 06:58.440
No. I want to work.

06:58.690 --> 06:59.754
Okay, so...

07:00.035 --> 07:01.743
let's go talk to Daniel Frye

07:01.762 --> 07:03.283
You can't interrogate him.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.010
No, I'm just gonna ask him some questions.

07:05.010 --> 07:06.380
You can interrogate him.

07:07.019 --> 07:08.388
Come on.

07:14.188 --> 07:16.227
Hey.

07:16.683 --> 07:17.691
Hey.

07:24.242 --> 07:25.925
Detective Sonya Cross.

07:26.344 --> 07:28.283
Oh, Detective Marco Ruiz.

07:28.327 --> 07:29.972
You're the bitch on the phone.

07:31.949 --> 07:33.351
Just doing my job.

07:33.471 --> 07:34.740
I could've died.

07:35.052 --> 07:36.185
But you didn't.

07:36.919 --> 07:39.382
Your car was used in a double homicide.

07:40.314 --> 07:42.530
Yeah, and then the nut job stole my car

07:42.530 --> 07:43.493
and put a bomb in it.

07:43.499 --> 07:45.620
Why don't you guys go find him, huh?

07:46.353 --> 07:47.723
We are trying.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.012
Well, that's great.

07:49.224 --> 07:50.532
Then I'm gonna leave.

07:50.582 --> 07:52.146
We searched your place.

07:56.152 --> 07:57.615
Sit down.

08:00.399 --> 08:01.919
Come on. Sit down.

08:05.617 --> 08:07.124
You can't do that.

08:07.306 --> 08:09.264
Well, we can and we did.

08:09.596 --> 08:12.067
And guess what, we found
your stash... the pills.

08:12.187 --> 08:14.150
All right, what is this shit?

08:15.308 --> 08:16.484
How did the killer

08:16.477 --> 08:18.098
get access to your car?

08:22.333 --> 08:23.584
Let's see.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.680
I, uh, worked until about midnight

08:25.699 --> 08:28.357
and then I went over to the
bar and I had a couple pops

08:28.477 --> 08:30.504
and I went back to the
office and I crashed.

08:30.541 --> 08:31.855
After that, I don't remember.

08:33.049 --> 08:34.139
Why is that?

08:35.152 --> 08:36.629
Tequila.

08:38.845 --> 08:39.933
Okay.

08:40.015 --> 08:41.929
So you've written about Judge Gates, right?

08:42.049 --> 08:43.400
You already asked me that question.

08:43.419 --> 08:44.618
We're asking again.

08:46.698 --> 08:47.953
immigration,

08:48.073 --> 08:50.475
some professor grabbing another
professor at the university,

08:50.482 --> 08:53.015
the cancer walk, the
Building Commission meetings,

08:53.034 --> 08:54.085
Puppypalooza.

08:54.104 --> 08:55.799
Whatever crap story my
editor wants to put me on,

08:55.837 --> 08:57.720
that's what I write about... it's my job.

08:58.007 --> 09:00.591
There are five murders a year in El Paso.

09:00.853 --> 09:03.084
In Juarez, thousands.

09:03.085 --> 09:04.163
Why?

09:04.213 --> 09:07.060
Why is one dead white woman more important

09:07.072 --> 09:09.944
than so many dead just across the bridge?

09:10.519 --> 09:12.090
Recognize that?

09:13.085 --> 09:14.355
Nope.

09:15.119 --> 09:17.332
You two have your work cut out for you.

09:18.715 --> 09:20.765
Why did he pick you, Frye?

09:20.885 --> 09:22.932
Why don't you two figure that out

09:23.052 --> 09:25.051
and then I'll write the story.

09:25.222 --> 09:28.425
Huh? That's what I would
call a win-win situation.

09:36.252 --> 09:38.366
Oh, uh, for the record, Officer,

09:38.391 --> 09:42.032
your bedside manner sucks dog balls.

09:53.881 --> 09:56.490
Why did you lie about searching his place?

09:56.610 --> 09:58.449
We needed him to talk, right?

09:59.030 --> 10:00.081
Lying's bad.

10:00.085 --> 10:01.484
He's not going to trust us now.

10:01.485 --> 10:04.129
He's a reporter... you
can't trust 'em anyway.

10:05.093 --> 10:06.713
They lie.

10:06.932 --> 10:08.551
What's that?

10:11.305 --> 10:12.719
Sorry about the drama,

10:12.751 --> 10:15.798
but it is hard to make
oneself heard these days.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.751
Cristina Fuentes died 14 months ago.

10:20.389 --> 10:21.985
Nobody investigated.

10:22.166 --> 10:23.605
Nobody cared.

10:23.868 --> 10:25.820
Just another dead girl.

10:25.940 --> 10:27.428
Another pink cross,

10:27.446 --> 10:29.405
another victim of the border.

10:31.595 --> 10:34.498
Well, ain't that a
well-stacked brick of cow shit.

10:34.618 --> 10:36.350
He's only getting started.

10:36.412 --> 10:38.145
Yeah, looks like it.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.291
I'm going to Juarez, Hank.

10:40.335 --> 10:41.592
What for, Sonya?

10:42.406 --> 10:43.913
It's where the case is, and...

10:43.907 --> 10:46.203
No, that's not a good idea.

10:51.453 --> 10:52.729
I'm going.

12:22.529 --> 12:23.925
N___

12:24.162 --> 12:25.927
P___

12:26.871 --> 12:29.080
She's here with me.

12:29.524 --> 12:31.520
Sonya sends her regards.

12:34.304 --> 12:36.350
Okay. Bye.

12:38.596 --> 12:40.322
My wife says hi.

12:41.148 --> 12:42.475
I didn't say hello.

12:42.493 --> 12:43.708
I don't know her.

12:43.751 --> 12:45.278
No, you will meet her.

12:47.643 --> 12:49.670
She's very curious about you.

12:49.790 --> 12:51.103
Why?

12:51.754 --> 12:54.363
She wants to know how we're getting along.

12:55.796 --> 12:57.441
How are we?

12:59.412 --> 13:00.545
Good.

13:02.622 --> 13:03.936
So far.

13:05.820 --> 13:07.478
Is that why she called?

13:07.734 --> 13:08.566
No.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.427
Doesn't she know you're working?

13:13.803 --> 13:15.417
Yes.

13:17.419 --> 13:19.291
She just wanted to hear my voice.

13:31.804 --> 13:34.582
T___

13:39.393 --> 13:41.364
Not everything is in the system.

13:41.677 --> 13:44.755
Some stuff we just keep in the boxes.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.352
Let's see what we have here in this file.

13:47.614 --> 13:49.228
It's a motel key.

13:49.898 --> 13:51.543
You've studied the case?

13:51.775 --> 13:53.240
It's not my job.

13:54.616 --> 13:56.249
It's okay.

14:01.436 --> 14:03.719
The other victims were cartel killings.

14:03.995 --> 14:06.666
Yup, tortured, shot

14:07.167 --> 14:08.587
and dumped.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.383
Just business.

14:11.641 --> 14:13.374
The men were all killed at the same time.

14:13.405 --> 14:15.157
Cristina a month before.

14:16.252 --> 14:17.559
Okay.

14:18.517 --> 14:20.826
What's in the box that's not in the system?

14:24.298 --> 14:25.681
Rafa Galvan,

14:25.919 --> 14:27.821
Fausto Galvan's brother.

14:31.917 --> 14:34.003
So, there was another body?

14:38.527 --> 14:40.629
His body was taken from the morgue.

14:40.679 --> 14:41.886
And his name...

14:42.349 --> 14:44.352
erased from the system.

14:44.608 --> 14:46.397
23 became 22.

14:48.317 --> 14:50.463
I'm sorry. How does that happen?

14:51.195 --> 14:52.972
Galvan made a call.

14:55.211 --> 14:58.440
He didn't want his rivals
to have the satisfaction.

14:58.828 --> 14:59.998
So, you buried it?

15:00.236 --> 15:01.800
Not me.

15:02.032 --> 15:04.822
Captain Alejandro Robles.

15:05.047 --> 15:07.950
You must be Detective Sonya Cross.

15:09.070 --> 15:10.365
Yes.

15:12.029 --> 15:14.462
Welcome to Juarez, Detective.

15:20.863 --> 15:21.789
Oh.

15:22.039 --> 15:24.641
How are they hanging, Detective?

15:25.242 --> 15:26.909
Muy bien. Muy bien, Capitán.

15:26.940 --> 15:28.041
Straight and true.

15:29.461 --> 15:31.470
That's not what I've heard.

15:32.784 --> 15:33.522
Oh.

15:33.642 --> 15:36.394
Perhaps you can show us
how the Americans do it.

15:36.462 --> 15:37.426
Oh, no, Capitán.

15:37.426 --> 15:39.678
The task force is only for Cristina's case.

15:39.798 --> 15:42.418
I know what the task
force is for, Detective.

15:42.462 --> 15:45.033
The Chihuahua State Police
doesn't promote fools.

15:45.334 --> 15:46.472
Hmm.

15:48.374 --> 15:50.895
Why wasn't this case investigated?

15:52.103 --> 15:53.586
What case?

15:56.471 --> 15:58.279
23 cartel members

15:58.298 --> 16:01.294
dumped in the same house
as Cristina Fuentes.

16:03.127 --> 16:04.085
22.

16:05.330 --> 16:06.900
Not 23.

16:07.476 --> 16:09.127
Isn't that right, Detective?

16:09.153 --> 16:10.285
Sí señor.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.982
Okay, well, why wasn't it investigated?

16:17.351 --> 16:20.027
I___ Sí señor.

16:20.234 --> 16:21.685
Oh.

16:22.711 --> 16:24.888
Nice meeting you, Detective.

16:35.199 --> 16:38.402
W___

16:38.446 --> 16:39.309
No, señor.

16:39.322 --> 16:41.142
A___

16:41.167 --> 16:44.252
She's only interested in the girl.

16:44.721 --> 16:48.105
- Y___.
- Yes, sir.

16:48.149 --> 16:51.541
K___

16:51.591 --> 16:52.616
- Sí, señor.
- Understand?

16:52.629 --> 16:53.498
Sí.

17:06.410 --> 17:09.031
You can't come in here and
ask those kind of questions.

17:09.882 --> 17:11.371
We're investigating a murder.

17:11.384 --> 17:13.949
No, no, no, no, it doesn't
work like that down here!

17:18.116 --> 17:20.031
Is this about Fausto Galvan?

17:21.082 --> 17:22.676
You're going to get me killed.

17:23.315 --> 17:24.492
I have a family.

17:24.548 --> 17:27.026
A man like Fausto Galvan can take my wife

17:27.045 --> 17:28.697
and my kids out into the desert,

17:28.817 --> 17:31.607
burn 'em alive and make me watch.

17:31.657 --> 17:33.228
What does he have to do with this case?

17:33.265 --> 17:35.036
¡Nada! ¡Nothing!

17:35.092 --> 17:36.969
Why was her body dumped in that house?

17:36.982 --> 17:39.060
That's it, that's it. I'm... I'm done here.

17:39.079 --> 17:40.662
I'm... I'm taking you back.

17:41.012 --> 17:42.958
Come on, let's go.

17:43.002 --> 17:44.891
Come on, let's go, I said!

18:29.042 --> 18:30.725
Y___

18:32.071 --> 18:34.404
- L___.
- No!

18:34.422 --> 18:35.586
A___

18:35.811 --> 18:37.394
P___.

19:03.884 --> 19:06.480
W___

19:07.738 --> 19:09.132
Y___

19:09.252 --> 19:10.904
- Sí.
- W___

19:16.147 --> 19:18.168
Y___.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.476
Un gringo.

19:19.532 --> 19:21.297
H___.

19:21.653 --> 19:22.667
¿Que?

19:22.787 --> 19:24.669
T___.

19:25.113 --> 19:26.702
B___.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.815
T___.

19:29.499 --> 19:32.020
- A___.?
- No.

19:32.595 --> 19:34.673
A___.

19:38.752 --> 19:41.205
- Are you sure this is right?
- Verbatim.

19:41.325 --> 19:42.143
Wow.

19:42.481 --> 19:44.014
You stumbled into a story, Daniel.

19:44.026 --> 19:46.115
- No shit.
- What was it like?

19:46.172 --> 19:47.598
What do you think it
was like? It was awesome.

19:47.642 --> 19:49.425
So, why did this nut job pick you?

19:49.457 --> 19:51.947
I like to think he's a loyal reader.

19:52.647 --> 19:54.412
Okay, the police are gonna be watching you.

19:54.412 --> 19:55.119
They already are.

19:55.131 --> 19:57.009
We're gonna have to be
very careful with this.

19:57.046 --> 19:59.625
Come on, grow a pair.
Run the story. It's good.

20:00.745 --> 20:03.434
You know, I haven't seen
you at any meetings lately.

20:03.712 --> 20:05.820
Just been going to different meetings.

20:05.995 --> 20:07.679
You're a shitty liar.

20:07.967 --> 20:10.526
Hey, uh, Mendez? Come here.

20:11.921 --> 20:14.417
Okay, you're gonna be
working this story with Frye.

20:14.424 --> 20:15.300
Hey, bullshit.

20:15.337 --> 20:16.808
- I am not working with some cub reporter...
- Spare me the résumé recital,

20:16.833 --> 20:17.990
Daniel, please.

20:18.046 --> 20:19.786
You're gonna download the story to Mendez,

20:19.792 --> 20:22.282
you're gonna write the main story
about the killer's manifesto,

20:22.312 --> 20:23.464
without explaining how we got it.

20:23.482 --> 20:24.058
Of course.

20:24.058 --> 20:26.323
You're gonna write the
sidebar about what it was like

20:26.322 --> 20:27.768
to be in that car.

20:27.830 --> 20:28.838
Did you piss your pants?

20:28.831 --> 20:30.496
You know, that sort of a thing?

20:30.521 --> 20:31.547
Okay?

20:34.338 --> 20:36.090
File anything over 850,

20:36.096 --> 20:38.755
I'm gonna cut it down to size myself, okay?

20:39.362 --> 20:41.515
You have one hour. Go!

20:42.929 --> 20:44.349
Car is clean.

20:44.630 --> 20:47.334
We still have nothing on the
power outage on the bridge.

20:47.740 --> 20:50.174
Cooper's traced the judge's
credit card movements.

20:50.199 --> 20:51.694
We got her buying gas.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.501
Security camera.

20:55.804 --> 20:57.744
How did it go with you and Marco?

20:58.757 --> 21:00.378
Good.

21:02.268 --> 21:04.533
Good in as, you're working with him?

21:08.807 --> 21:10.083
He's mad at me.

21:10.590 --> 21:11.904
How come?

21:13.067 --> 21:15.239
I ask too many questions?

21:16.477 --> 21:18.110
Yes, you do.

21:22.169 --> 21:24.872
Does Carmen ever call you for no reason?

21:26.449 --> 21:28.445
Yeah, she does sometimes.

21:29.490 --> 21:30.928
His wife called

21:30.940 --> 21:32.580
when we were working...

21:32.700 --> 21:34.331
just to hear his voice.

21:35.007 --> 21:37.541
It seems like such a waste of time...

21:38.973 --> 21:40.155
I got him.

21:40.275 --> 21:42.308
You got... Oh.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.210
We know Judge Gates

21:44.222 --> 21:46.419
- stopped for gas in Sonora, right?
- Right.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.059
She goes inside.

21:49.335 --> 21:50.761
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

21:51.124 --> 21:52.776
He was waiting in the backseat.

21:53.032 --> 21:54.140
He must have followed her.

21:54.165 --> 21:55.666
Play that bit again.

22:00.541 --> 22:02.173
Excuse me. Miss Charlotte,

22:02.401 --> 22:03.950
there's a man here to see you.

22:04.070 --> 22:05.420
I'm busy.

22:05.789 --> 22:07.698
He's not going away.

22:15.971 --> 22:18.677
Monte P. Flagman, Esquire.

22:18.797 --> 22:21.677
- I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.
- Thank you.

22:22.540 --> 22:24.185
It's a lenticular.

22:24.436 --> 22:25.743
Stars and Stripes?

22:25.863 --> 22:28.240
Turn it, you get the Lone Star?

22:30.047 --> 22:33.182
My wife insisted on making her
three bean salad for the wake.

22:36.035 --> 22:38.244
Looks like a cyclone blew through here.

22:38.938 --> 22:41.022
You ever seen a real one up close?

22:41.916 --> 22:43.148
It's a hell of a thing.

22:44.476 --> 22:46.171
I'm sorry. How do you know my husband?

22:46.209 --> 22:48.111
Did some legal work for him.

22:48.630 --> 22:50.339
He never mentioned your name.

22:53.054 --> 22:54.969
This is about the tunnel, isn't it?

22:55.206 --> 22:56.320
Yes, ma'am.

22:56.868 --> 22:58.722
I want to make you
aware of some obligations

22:58.741 --> 23:01.111
- Karl had to my client.
- Karl's dead.

23:05.221 --> 23:07.174
You've come a long way since meeting Karl.

23:07.242 --> 23:09.989
Waiting tables in Miami,
or was it the Keys?

23:10.109 --> 23:11.659
It was Tampa.

23:15.056 --> 23:16.757
Technically speaking,

23:16.877 --> 23:18.716
this is still Karl's ranch.

23:19.104 --> 23:21.725
It could take a while for the estate
to settle out with the lawyers.

23:21.793 --> 23:24.653
Then there's Karl's
daughter Katie to consider.

23:26.017 --> 23:28.182
Those probate hearings
can be kind of tricky.

23:28.770 --> 23:30.278
What's your point?

23:31.153 --> 23:33.068
Karl had good taste in horses.

23:33.105 --> 23:34.263
What'd he call this one?

23:34.663 --> 23:36.027
Rio.

23:37.015 --> 23:39.042
Those bloodlines cost money.

23:40.112 --> 23:42.677
Horse like that'll cost
you a hundred grand, easy.

23:42.896 --> 23:44.736
My client gave it to him.

23:45.468 --> 23:47.050
What is your client's name?

23:47.170 --> 23:49.027
I'm not at liberty to say.

23:50.016 --> 23:53.213
I simply want to point out
there is a prior obligation

23:53.263 --> 23:56.223
between your late husband and my client.

23:57.061 --> 23:58.393
Okay.

23:58.801 --> 24:00.364
See, I don't know if Karl told you,

24:00.377 --> 24:02.341
but he took a real bath in the crash.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.169
Kind of got out over his skis, as they say.

24:07.109 --> 24:09.299
I just wanted to introduce myself.

24:11.808 --> 24:13.347
You have my card.

24:48.835 --> 24:50.698
Y___.

24:50.729 --> 24:53.638
S___.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.284
C___.

25:07.377 --> 25:09.147
G___!

25:11.155 --> 25:13.558
Y___?

25:13.583 --> 25:15.578
Get out!

25:15.635 --> 25:18.744
I___.n.

25:18.864 --> 25:21.196
W___.?

25:24.838 --> 25:27.285
I___.

25:32.797 --> 25:34.980
T___.

25:35.100 --> 25:38.722
Y___.

25:40.730 --> 25:43.020
G___.

25:43.821 --> 25:46.537
I___.

25:47.550 --> 25:51.585
W___.

25:54.451 --> 25:55.727
F___.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.625
H___?

27:38.745 --> 27:40.133
1___.

27:41.653 --> 27:42.836
Y___?

27:43.343 --> 27:44.644
C___.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.840
H___?

28:00.403 --> 28:01.835
A___,

28:01.955 --> 28:03.363
o___.

28:03.483 --> 28:05.039
B___...

28:05.102 --> 28:06.685
S___.

28:07.867 --> 28:09.093
S___?

28:09.907 --> 28:11.289
Y___?

28:11.409 --> 28:13.180
T___.

28:13.493 --> 28:14.669
Hmm?

28:17.741 --> 28:20.675
S___.

28:57.828 --> 28:58.435
Hi.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.255
- You waiting for someone?
- No.

29:03.414 --> 29:05.172
Can I buy you a drink?

29:05.234 --> 29:05.960
No.

29:12.717 --> 29:13.668
Okay.

29:26.194 --> 29:27.564
Hey.

29:28.240 --> 29:29.829
Why'd you walk away?

29:30.173 --> 29:32.219
I just didn't want a drink.

29:34.365 --> 29:35.416
Okay.

29:35.807 --> 29:38.214
Want to have sex with me?

29:38.752 --> 29:41.010
We can go back to my place.

29:45.209 --> 29:46.754
What, is this some kind of joke?

29:47.173 --> 29:49.473
- No. Why, you married?
- No.

29:49.486 --> 29:51.807
Want to have sex, yes or no?

29:54.947 --> 29:56.092
Yes.

29:56.307 --> 29:57.444
Good.

30:31.810 --> 30:33.653
You're late again, Steven.

30:33.773 --> 30:35.308
Yes, I know that.

30:36.147 --> 30:37.323
Traffic.

30:37.443 --> 30:39.050
They found that judge up

30:39.081 --> 30:40.820
on the Bridge of Americas last night.

30:40.870 --> 30:41.884
Oh, yeah.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.472
Yeah, I saw that.

30:43.473 --> 30:44.781
It's just terrible.

30:46.238 --> 30:48.053
Well, I don't know.

30:48.109 --> 30:49.711
Maybe she had it coming.

30:50.430 --> 30:51.807
Nobody has that coming.

30:51.813 --> 30:52.927
You don't mean that, Steven.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.725
I know. No, you're right.

30:55.564 --> 30:57.439
I guess that's just my politics.

30:58.605 --> 30:59.875
What's new?

31:00.676 --> 31:02.496
Valentina's got her court date.

31:02.502 --> 31:04.148
Big John's talking about the river

31:04.154 --> 31:06.087
and Emmy Lou again and not taking his meds.

31:06.099 --> 31:07.394
Mrs. Nelson wandered off.

31:07.420 --> 31:08.208
Toilet's leaking.

31:08.227 --> 31:09.922
Felipe found a dead rat in the cooler,

31:09.959 --> 31:11.274
another in the storeroom.

31:12.540 --> 31:13.783
When did she come in?

31:14.571 --> 31:15.839
Night before last.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.574
Refused to see the nurse.

31:17.612 --> 31:20.684
Possible 51-50. Bowl of
soup and she was gone.

31:20.940 --> 31:22.272
What happened to your hand?

31:22.905 --> 31:23.919
It's nothing.

31:23.950 --> 31:25.119
You go on home now.

31:25.139 --> 31:27.204
You get some rest.

31:28.562 --> 31:30.501
Make sure Felipe sets rat traps.

31:30.505 --> 31:32.203
I will set them myself.

31:54.788 --> 31:56.027
Drink first?

31:57.272 --> 31:58.567
Okay.

32:49.690 --> 32:51.685
Have you done this before?

32:51.805 --> 32:53.412
Yeah. You?

32:53.532 --> 32:55.623
Yeah.

32:55.743 --> 32:58.419
Okay, let's go.

33:05.094 --> 33:08.532
Faster! Fast!

33:08.817 --> 33:13.205
Oh!

34:13.902 --> 34:18.351
Hey...

34:21.647 --> 34:24.319
- D___.
- Gracias.

34:24.713 --> 34:26.132
K___?

34:26.253 --> 34:28.542
S___

34:29.011 --> 34:33.309

T___.

34:46.824 --> 34:50.553
Bien.

35:33.490 --> 35:35.192
What the hell is that?

35:36.475 --> 35:38.700
- Work.
- Work? What do you do?

35:38.975 --> 35:41.359
Detective, El Paso PD.

35:45.939 --> 35:47.634
You want me to go?

35:50.368 --> 35:51.869
You want to stay?

35:52.382 --> 35:53.715
You can sleep.

35:55.323 --> 35:56.468
Who is that?

35:56.799 --> 35:58.401
Corpse.

35:59.952 --> 36:00.884
Yeah,

36:01.842 --> 36:03.480
- maybe I should go.
- Okay.

36:07.797 --> 36:09.117
Here you go.

36:10.543 --> 36:11.982
Thank you.

36:31.757 --> 36:35.248
T___.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.631
S___

36:38.169 --> 36:40.328

I___.

37:14.305 --> 37:16.670
A___?

37:17.729 --> 37:19.392
- Sonya?
- Hmm.

37:19.512 --> 37:20.568
¿Que?

37:21.738 --> 37:23.133
S___?

37:23.652 --> 37:25.029
Eh.

37:26.292 --> 37:27.875
S___.

37:28.857 --> 37:30.784
A___.

37:30.822 --> 37:32.692
I___.

37:33.149 --> 37:35.414
N___.

37:45.576 --> 37:47.102
I___.

37:48.823 --> 37:52.133
W___? H___?

37:52.253 --> 37:54.336
- I___...
- I___.

37:59.954 --> 38:02.581
- A___?
- Sí.

38:03.820 --> 38:06.409
H___?

38:06.441 --> 38:08.161
W___.

38:09.131 --> 38:11.120
W___.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.323
I___.

38:22.957 --> 38:24.922
W___.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.305
There's something there.

38:47.361 --> 38:48.623
Going back with Marco.

38:48.619 --> 38:50.201
Yeah, there's a bunch of rocks there.

38:50.233 --> 38:52.003
Did you stare at those
photographs all night?

38:52.041 --> 38:54.147
Not all night. I had sex.

38:56.217 --> 38:58.796
I don't need to know that, Sonya.

39:00.391 --> 39:02.925
Did you at least dance
with the fella first?

39:03.045 --> 39:05.309
Hey, boss, you see that yet?

39:09.627 --> 39:12.061
It's the killer's message verbatim.

39:16.823 --> 39:18.693
How'd he get this?

39:21.250 --> 39:23.235
I played it for him.

39:24.183 --> 39:25.643
Cooper?

39:25.675 --> 39:27.182
What can I do you for, Hank?

39:27.183 --> 39:29.610
I'm sorry, am... am I
interrupting your snack time?

39:29.635 --> 39:31.544
I'm just topping off
my good bacteria, boss.

39:31.563 --> 39:33.671
You got good and bad
bacteria in your stomach,

39:33.696 --> 39:34.641
and they're at war.

39:34.761 --> 39:36.762
Yeah, well, now they're in the trash.

39:36.831 --> 39:38.526
I want you to follow this reporter.

39:38.545 --> 39:40.204
Our killer chose him for a reason.

39:40.210 --> 39:41.042
I want you on him.

39:41.086 --> 39:43.200
Like a hair on a biscuit.

39:44.583 --> 39:45.972
I'm sorry, Hank.

39:48.193 --> 39:49.934
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

39:51.223 --> 39:52.706
Sonya, it's okay.

39:52.762 --> 39:55.565
Just, um, shh... It's okay.

39:55.759 --> 39:57.555
- Just check with me next time.
- Okay.

40:18.033 --> 40:20.167
W___.

40:20.674 --> 40:21.500
N___.

40:22.206 --> 40:25.273
T___.

40:28.145 --> 40:29.734
T___.

41:16.150 --> 41:17.921
What the hell...?

41:24.386 --> 41:26.123
Of course, I saw you pass by.

41:26.142 --> 41:27.343
What is this?

41:27.463 --> 41:29.199
Coyote.

41:29.319 --> 41:30.840
It was disturbing the crime scene.

41:30.865 --> 41:31.779
So you killed it?

41:31.779 --> 41:32.798
Yes, ma'am.

41:32.980 --> 41:35.714
Scare off other vermin,
predators, what have you.

41:36.109 --> 41:38.123
Yeah, can't have the
crime scene contaminated.

41:38.519 --> 41:39.844
What are you doing here?

41:39.844 --> 41:41.233
I was on a stakeout.

41:41.258 --> 41:42.515
A stakeout?

41:42.515 --> 41:43.379
Yes, sir.

41:43.423 --> 41:45.587
Killers sometimes revisit
their crime scenes...

41:45.593 --> 41:46.907
I read it in a book.

41:47.186 --> 41:48.290
So I've been watching.

41:48.553 --> 41:50.560
Yeah. Good work, Deputy.

41:50.573 --> 41:51.643
Yeah.

41:51.763 --> 41:52.938
As you can see, I...

41:53.219 --> 41:54.671
preserved the field of evidence.

41:54.677 --> 41:55.991
The blood's intact.

41:56.111 --> 41:58.093
Thank you. Gracias.

41:58.131 --> 41:59.964
I understand a task force is imminent.

42:00.014 --> 42:00.715
Yes.

42:00.835 --> 42:02.654
I'd like to be part of it, being

42:02.667 --> 42:04.099
I was first one on the scene.

42:04.131 --> 42:06.282
We'll keep you in mind.

42:07.045 --> 42:09.079
You okay?

42:09.123 --> 42:13.152
Uh, it's, uh, oh, migraine coming on.

42:14.147 --> 42:16.262
Whoo! It's a head buster.

42:22.787 --> 42:24.045
What's that?

42:24.402 --> 42:25.941
A bead.

42:36.702 --> 42:39.061
Don't worry, Jose... I'm gonna bury 'em.

42:39.181 --> 42:41.351
Railroad doesn't have a leg to stand on.

42:41.545 --> 42:43.765
Now, you go home, take you some ibuprofen,

42:43.885 --> 42:46.913
get that pretty wife of yours to
rub some liniment on your neck.

42:48.433 --> 42:49.972
Miss Millwright.

42:50.041 --> 42:51.993
I see you found us okay.

42:53.401 --> 42:56.479
This is three bean salad.

42:58.694 --> 43:00.064
And this is money.

43:00.184 --> 43:01.760
And I don't want it.

43:06.866 --> 43:09.763
I was a hostess, not a waitress.

43:09.982 --> 43:12.096
I stand corrected.

43:13.936 --> 43:15.626
Ma'am.

43:21.876 --> 43:23.759
W___.

43:23.879 --> 43:26.380
- W___?
- ¡Vengan!

43:29.766 --> 43:31.180
I___.

43:43.279 --> 43:45.857
D___.

43:49.423 --> 43:52.414
I___.

43:52.870 --> 43:55.267
N___.

43:56.249 --> 43:57.463
N___.

43:58.644 --> 44:00.959
A___?

44:01.079 --> 44:03.218
___.

44:13.426 --> 44:14.525
It's a bead.

44:14.527 --> 44:16.579
He left it for us to find.

44:17.530 --> 44:18.462
There's a man here.

44:18.478 --> 44:20.990
He says he's responsible for the message.

44:27.911 --> 44:29.337
Can we help you?

44:32.722 --> 44:34.173
Excuse me.

44:35.545 --> 44:37.176
Sir.

44:38.703 --> 44:40.391
Good to finally meet you.

44:41.018 --> 44:43.414
- Don't move!
- Show me your hands!

44:43.433 --> 44:44.528
Let's see your hands!

44:44.584 --> 44:45.460
What's the matter?

44:47.787 --> 44:48.813
Don't move!

44:53.937 --> 44:56.014
I do over 33 impressions.

44:56.290 --> 44:57.877
Community theater.

44:57.878 --> 44:59.881
Maybe you remember me as Falstaff?

45:00.125 --> 45:01.164
No.

45:01.678 --> 45:02.903
You're an actor?

45:03.898 --> 45:06.625
When I saw the paper,
I couldn't believe it.

45:06.632 --> 45:08.540
Who asked you to record the message?

45:08.540 --> 45:09.510
I don't know.

45:09.511 --> 45:12.569
The script came with a note as
to how they wanted it recorded.

45:12.588 --> 45:14.859
No name, just a P.O. box return.

45:14.922 --> 45:17.644
And you didn't think the
whole thing was strange?

45:18.194 --> 45:19.270
The letter said that it was

45:19.301 --> 45:20.825
for an art performance or something.

45:20.853 --> 45:22.061
How'd you get paid?

45:22.261 --> 45:24.125
Money order, if I remember right.

45:24.182 --> 45:25.270
Do you still have the script

45:25.283 --> 45:26.415
and letter with the P.O. box?

45:26.428 --> 45:27.322
No.

45:28.067 --> 45:29.168
Why not?

45:29.193 --> 45:30.789
It's been a long time.

45:32.297 --> 45:34.655
Recorded it three years ago.

45:48.850 --> 45:50.233
Howdy.

45:51.046 --> 45:52.654
Give it.

45:54.518 --> 45:57.709
Yeah, the car matches, the time matches.

45:58.197 --> 45:59.843
It's the dude.

46:02.139 --> 46:05.348
He said he's in Juarez for the señoritas.

46:06.011 --> 46:08.828
So, you, uh, got your address there, amigo.

46:10.554 --> 46:12.332
You know, I had no
reason not to believe him.

46:14.878 --> 46:16.692
We're good, right?

46:21.716 --> 46:22.886
Hey.

46:24.569 --> 46:26.909
- Want some?
- No.

46:26.953 --> 46:28.786
Aw, come on, you've earned it.

46:29.543 --> 46:31.863
Front page of the local newspaper.

46:31.983 --> 46:33.415
Wires'll pick up.

46:33.535 --> 46:34.810
You think?

46:36.051 --> 46:38.434
It's good. It's good stuff.

46:39.861 --> 46:41.250
You sure?

46:41.845 --> 46:43.389
I'm okay. Thank you.

46:44.228 --> 46:47.073
Hey, sorry about being such a dick earlier.

46:47.249 --> 46:49.032
Why are you such a dick?

46:49.945 --> 46:51.972
I was born that way.

46:58.578 --> 46:59.911
Shit. Hey...

47:01.407 --> 47:03.796
How much you want to bet that's a cop?

47:04.711 --> 47:06.155
With that moustache.

47:06.174 --> 47:07.938
That hat.

47:11.880 --> 47:13.425
That's weird.

47:16.511 --> 47:18.458
- This is Frye.
- Hello, Daniel.

47:18.578 --> 47:20.196
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

47:20.233 --> 47:21.854
It's the killer... give me a pen.

47:21.892 --> 47:22.555
Pen, pen...

47:22.555 --> 47:23.658
Uh-huh, yeah, I'm listening.

47:23.778 --> 47:24.877
No, just wait one... one sec.

47:24.878 --> 47:25.977
Okay?

47:25.978 --> 47:27.622
Okay, I'm ready.

47:28.292 --> 47:31.370
Three, one, six, zero, six,

47:31.490 --> 47:35.549
zero, two, five, one, zero, six,

47:35.936 --> 47:40.065
zero, two, six, three, zero, six.

47:40.111 --> 47:41.677
Okay, is that... is that it?

47:41.678 --> 47:42.949
Hello?

47:44.245 --> 47:45.421
That was the killer.

47:45.440 --> 47:46.147
What did he say?

47:46.172 --> 47:46.948
He told me to pay attention

47:46.992 --> 47:48.387
and then he gave me this number.

47:48.925 --> 47:50.139
Look, three, one, six, zero, six.

47:50.176 --> 47:51.578
Code just keeps going.

47:51.941 --> 47:53.691
Give me the pen.

47:55.532 --> 47:57.240
What the hell does it mean?

47:58.516 --> 47:59.986
It's a GPS coordinate.

48:00.024 --> 48:01.156
Longitude and latitude.

48:01.150 --> 48:02.364
How do you know that?

48:02.484 --> 48:04.528
Father was a surveyor for Pemex.

48:04.540 --> 48:05.929
No shit.

48:06.248 --> 48:07.293
See?

48:07.413 --> 48:10.303
East of town, down by the border.

48:35.704 --> 48:38.104
What do you think you're doing?

48:40.052 --> 48:43.312
Buenos días... señorita.

48:43.787 --> 48:45.051
Buenos días, my ass.

48:45.070 --> 48:46.184
I'm calling the cops.

49:00.072 --> 49:01.424
Where is Steven Linder?

49:01.544 --> 49:02.725
I don't know.

49:15.388 --> 49:17.140
He took something from me.

49:18.691 --> 49:20.631
I want it back.

49:22.564 --> 49:25.717
God have mercy on you.

49:26.155 --> 49:27.412
Maybe.

50:05.214 --> 50:06.491
It's almost dark.

50:06.491 --> 50:08.280
Better for the story.

50:08.400 --> 50:10.501
"Two Reporters Lured to Their Death"?

50:10.521 --> 50:12.447
Hopefully one of us lives.

50:12.497 --> 50:14.330
The other one can write the story.

50:15.049 --> 50:16.882
I smell a Pulitzer.

50:18.065 --> 50:19.660
So, what's your deal?

50:19.780 --> 50:21.931
What are you, uh, community college?

50:21.968 --> 50:23.076
You write a blog or something?

50:23.113 --> 50:24.508
U.T. Austin.

50:24.628 --> 50:26.161
Boyfriend?

50:26.761 --> 50:28.426
What, you want to get to know me now?

50:28.419 --> 50:30.309
Not really.

50:30.429 --> 50:33.005
Oh, hey, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

50:34.400 --> 50:35.582
What?

50:35.839 --> 50:37.603
It says, "Go right."

51:02.285 --> 51:04.106
It's just down here.

51:04.431 --> 51:06.277
Down where?

51:11.444 --> 51:12.733
Holy shit!

51:18.915 --> 51:20.779
Oh, my God.

51:36.701 --> 51:38.328
Aw, hell.

51:39.054 --> 51:41.062
Dangerous crossing.

51:41.281 --> 51:43.559
The fence forces them out here.

51:44.172 --> 51:45.961
Nine bodies.

52:24.014 --> 52:25.434
It's him.
