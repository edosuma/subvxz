10:07.140 --> 10:10.275
to help our investigation
in exchange for updates.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.110
Oh, I see.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.245
So you told me about the gun
in the church.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.615
Now I'm supposed to give you
my perspective.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.950
And here I thought
you only came back

10:18.952 --> 10:22.020
because captain Mary poppins
wanted a tail on me.

10:22.022 --> 10:25.857
And you, as detective honor
roll, volunteered.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.892
"I'll go, nanny.
I'll go."

10:27.894 --> 10:30.061
All right, if you want to hear
about our progress,

10:30.063 --> 10:32.597
and that is all you're getting
out of this -- updates --

10:32.599 --> 10:34.132
you need to stop
playing detective

10:34.134 --> 10:36.067
and be a little more
forthcoming with me.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.704
Is this your "please, I need
more help" tone of voice?

10:39.706 --> 10:41.640
Because it could use
some work.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.041
Instead of
getting mad at me,

10:43.043 --> 10:44.976
why don't you concentrate
on the criminals,

10:44.978 --> 10:46.111
like Emile fisher?

10:46.113 --> 10:47.679
He's out of prison --

10:47.681 --> 10:49.247
yeah, we know that and we're
trying to locate him.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.949
-The problem is --
-you're<i> trying</i> to locate him?

10:50.951 --> 10:52.884
Trying?
I can't believe you guys.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.820
In the Reese murder book,
tao has a sheriff's report

10:55.822 --> 10:58.289
that lists all the names
of the 28th street bloods

10:58.291 --> 11:00.125
that showed up
at price's trial.

11:00.127 --> 11:03.194
And maybe one of them
wasn't there

11:03.196 --> 11:04.996
to support
reverend trigger.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.600
Maybe one was there
to support Emile

11:08.602 --> 11:13.104
and only showed up on the days
our star witness testified.

11:13.106 --> 11:17.142

that gangster's name...

11:17.144 --> 11:18.877

just tell me.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.749
And you'll explain to nanny
you found him how?

11:24.751 --> 11:26.751
Remember the rules,
honor roll.

11:26.753 --> 11:29.354
You got to show
your sources.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.724
Or is this that point
in our relationship

11:32.726 --> 11:36.394
where you can start talking
about me to your friends?

11:36.396 --> 11:38.697
No.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.866
But you're officially
under surveillance.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.401
I could follow you
to Emile.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.403
Except I'm not going anywhere.
You are.

11:45.405 --> 11:50.208

over in bed and finds me gone.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.877
She was a police officer, too,
you know,

11:52.879 --> 11:55.346
before I ruined her life.

11:55.348 --> 11:58.416

in a cooler.

during the robbery?

12:12.199 --> 12:14.999

12:42.195 --> 12:44.028
Have we found Emile yet?

12:44.030 --> 12:47.766
Well, um, I was wondering,
during price's trial,

12:47.768 --> 12:49.768
was there anyone
from the 28th street bloods

12:49.770 --> 12:51.136
who showed up
just for Emile?

12:51.138 --> 12:53.872
Tao: His name was Greg mann,
a.K.A. Buddha.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.807
And he was only present in court

12:55.809 --> 12:58.343
during the three days
Emile was testifying.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.278
So are Buddha
and Emile related?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.714
Don't know.
Maybe through the gang.

13:02.716 --> 13:04.716
Though Buddha doesn't have
a record.

13:04.718 --> 13:06.885

in Fontana.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.789

That's a little out of the way.

13:10.791 --> 13:13.825
Maybe Emile didn't want to bump
into any of his old friends.

13:13.827 --> 13:17.762
Send s.I.S. To Buddha's house
and see if Emile shows up there.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.498
Amy may have had
a great hunch.

13:20.500 --> 13:24.869
Oh, more than great.

Buzz, in the off chance
that you make the cut

13:37.117 --> 13:41.052

patrice's wedding reception,

13:41.054 --> 13:44.189

prefer we serve?

13:44.191 --> 13:46.357
Sesame chicken or ribeye?

13:46.359 --> 13:47.826

in the unlikely event
that you ever tie the knot,

13:53.767 --> 13:57.468

will let me spend,

the budget.

Is my blinker out?

19:52.458 --> 19:53.758
I need you
to come downtown.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.693
Look, I thought about it.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.128
I'm gonna take you
to see Emile.

19:57.130 --> 19:58.362
No, we already have Emile.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.431
And we know how he got
to Fontana,

20:00.433 --> 20:02.433
so now you
have a problem, mark.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.769
Don't you mean
<i> we</i> have a problem?

20:04.771 --> 20:06.871
What if I walk
into your division

20:06.873 --> 20:09.740
and explain to everyone
how you and I have been...

20:09.742 --> 20:11.576
Collaborating?

20:11.578 --> 20:13.878
You have to decide if that's
in your best interests,

20:13.880 --> 20:15.513
but you're coming
downtown.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.748
So either you get dragged
out of this vehicle

20:17.750 --> 20:19.350
or we escort you
to p.A.B.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.152
Okay.

20:21.154 --> 20:24.422
You know, I never say no
to a really great escort,

20:24.424 --> 20:29.260
and I bet you'd make
one of the best.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.634
You might want
to fix that.

20:36.636 --> 20:39.804
The fine for a bad mirror
is pretty steep.

20:45.678 --> 20:48.512
Hey, hey, hey.
It's the whole gang.

20:48.514 --> 20:49.880
Louie provenza,
look at you!

20:49.882 --> 20:52.483
Sitting at your old desk,
all mummified.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.518
Andy. Steal cheating
on your girlfriends?

20:54.520 --> 20:58.222
How many you juggling now?
You got both hands full?

20:58.224 --> 20:59.924
Julio.
Oh, well.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.926
And I really dig
the new girl.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.828
Yeah, boy, oh,
she's miss quota hire.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.330
You got to look like
America, folks.

21:06.332 --> 21:08.733
And Mike.
Hey, buddy.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.201
Sold out
any other cops lately?

21:10.203 --> 21:11.736
H-how's your conscience
treating you?

21:11.738 --> 21:12.937
I go to bed sober.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.672
How about yourself?

21:14.674 --> 21:16.974
Hate to interrupt your little
reunion, Mr. hickman,

21:16.976 --> 21:18.676
but we need to talk.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.911
That's all right, Sharon.
Call me mark.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.480
No need to be so formal.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.781
Let's go to my office.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.449
No.
No, no, no, no.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.618
I'm not stepping into
your little sewing room.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.919
We'll talk right here.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.788
Unless I'm under arrest.
Am I under arrest?

21:30.790 --> 21:34.625
No? Okay.
What do you want to know?

21:34.627 --> 21:37.561
All right, I'm curious as
to why you drove to solano

21:37.563 --> 21:40.431
to pick up Emile when he was
released from prison.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.866
Hey, I missed the guy.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.602
Plus, I thought sitting in jail
for over a decade

21:44.604 --> 21:45.903
might improve his memory.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.505
Could be he finally realized

21:47.507 --> 21:49.440
where he ditched a certain
murder weapon.

21:49.442 --> 21:53.311
Emile is the key to all of this,
by the way,

21:53.313 --> 21:55.780
if you're too clueless
to figure that out.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.948
Hey. You want to watch
your mouth, hickman?

21:57.950 --> 22:01.819
No, no. Andy, by all means,
let mark educate us.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.255
What would you like us
to know, mark?

22:04.257 --> 22:06.924
When Emile and Daniel price
robbed the flower shop

22:06.926 --> 22:08.492
and killed officer Reese,

22:08.494 --> 22:11.329
there was a third guy in the car
waiting for them.

22:11.331 --> 22:14.265
And the third guy knows
where the gun was ditched,

22:14.267 --> 22:17.501
and that third guy ambushed
Rachel gray and her bodyguard.

22:17.503 --> 22:22.373
And Emile fisher knows
who that third guy is.

22:22.375 --> 22:25.609
Except why would a third guy
come back after 12 years

22:25.611 --> 22:27.645
and kill tamika Weaver?

22:27.647 --> 22:28.779
Well, if you catch him
before I do,

22:28.781 --> 22:30.348
perhaps he'll tell you that.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.616
Well, this old mummy suggests
you remember

22:32.618 --> 22:34.418
you are a private citizen

22:34.420 --> 22:36.721
and this is an active
investigation.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.856
Keep it up, mark,
and I will arrest you

22:38.858 --> 22:40.391
for obstruction of justice

22:40.393 --> 22:42.393
and impersonating
a police officer.

22:42.395 --> 22:46.897
<i> You're</i> accusing<i> me</i> of
impersonating a police officer?

22:46.899 --> 22:48.766
And they say irony is dead.

22:48.768 --> 22:51.035
Let me give you
a little warning, too.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.770
Never drag me down here again

22:52.772 --> 22:55.306
unless you plan on
reading me my rights.

22:55.308 --> 22:57.575
And if Emile fisher is here,
act like cops,

22:57.577 --> 23:00.144
and get him to cough up the name
of the third guy.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.414
And you --

23:06.085 --> 23:09.754
why don't you concentrate
on finding the killer

23:09.756 --> 23:11.756
instead of hassling me?

23:16.696 --> 23:20.398
I say we draw straws.
Short one gets to shoot him.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.866
He's not worth
wasting a bullet.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.100
I'll donate one.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.835
Tao: Nothing we can do
to mark is worse

23:24.837 --> 23:26.570
than what he's done
to himself,

23:26.572 --> 23:29.106
<i> but</i> he's not always wrong.

23:29.108 --> 23:32.109
If we accept that there is
a third person in that car

23:32.111 --> 23:34.879
who could be charged for
the murders of officer Reese,

23:34.881 --> 23:37.415
d.D.A. Gray and Eric Dunn,

23:37.417 --> 23:42.486
then we need to find out who
Emile fisher and Daniel price

23:42.488 --> 23:44.822
are trying to protect.

23:52.698 --> 23:54.432
This Gary is
a lot of trouble.

23:54.434 --> 23:55.866
It comes
with the territory.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.935
Well, it may not be
your mother's fault.

23:57.937 --> 24:01.005
Her record is good,
she left this terrible guy,

24:01.007 --> 24:03.007
she tested clean
and sober.

24:03.009 --> 24:04.742
Then why is she staying away
from me?

24:04.744 --> 24:05.876
Maybe she's not.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.611
Maybe she's staying away
from me.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.880
If Gary is still
following me,

24:09.882 --> 24:12.450
can lieutenant Cooper
just, like, shoot first

24:12.452 --> 24:13.851
and ask questions later?

24:13.853 --> 24:15.419
No, rusty.

24:15.421 --> 24:18.556
We want Gary arrested
and convicted.

24:18.558 --> 24:21.992
It'll be his third strike
and be the best solution.

24:21.994 --> 24:25.062
And you do understand
that if lieutenant Cooper

24:25.064 --> 24:26.764
spots Gary following you,

24:26.766 --> 24:29.700
you are<i> not</i> to get involved
in the takedown.

24:29.702 --> 24:30.935
Yes.

24:30.937 --> 24:32.670
Just stand back

24:32.672 --> 24:35.840
and let the professionals
do their thing. I know.

24:35.842 --> 24:40.678
May I ask why you waited so long
to talk to me about this?

24:40.680 --> 24:43.080
I --

24:43.082 --> 24:48.552
I didn't want to be an issue
when you have this job offer.

24:48.554 --> 24:49.987
I'm not sold on it
anyway.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.755
Andy is!

24:51.757 --> 24:52.923
Triple your salary,

24:52.925 --> 24:55.025

the country,

24:55.027 --> 24:57.428

for football.

24:57.430 --> 24:58.829
You love football.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.097
I do love football.

25:00.099 --> 25:03.033
And I love the job
I have, too.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.536
And if money were
that important to me,

25:05.538 --> 25:07.838
I would have left the l.A.P.D.
Decades ago.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.875
But more than that,

25:10.877 --> 25:12.843
I don't want you
holding back issues

25:12.845 --> 25:15.212
because you're afraid of how
it will affect me.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.615
I'm sorry. I --

25:17.617 --> 25:19.917
I guess I just --

25:19.919 --> 25:24.054
I don't like the way the past
keeps popping up all the time

25:24.056 --> 25:28.092
and having to explain it
to people.

25:28.094 --> 25:29.960
Tell me about it.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.898
Emile hasn't changed his mind
about talking to us.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.766
And the guy cries a lot
for an ex-con.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.167
He keeps asking
when he can leave,

25:37.169 --> 25:39.470
and we really don't have
anything we can hold him on.

25:39.472 --> 25:42.640
But Mike went looking through
the sheriff records again

25:42.642 --> 25:44.842
and he found someone
interesting

25:44.844 --> 25:47.144
who wasn't at
Daniel price's trial.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.979
Who?

25:48.981 --> 25:50.915
His younger brother,
Dennis.

25:50.917 --> 25:53.250
Youth minister at salvation
community church.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.919
He's on his way
over here now.

25:54.921 --> 25:57.087
Dennis price
was puffing out his chest

25:57.089 --> 25:58.889
at tamika's crime scene, too,

25:58.891 --> 26:01.091
though he used to be a member
of the 28th street bloods.

26:01.093 --> 26:04.061
He nickname was, uh...
Okay, hold on.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.931
Mike, did you not look closely
at Dennis at the time?

26:06.933 --> 26:09.833
Very. But he had alibis
for all three murders,

26:09.835 --> 26:11.101
though they were
family related --

26:11.103 --> 26:12.670
you know, with his mother,
Uncle, aunt,

26:12.672 --> 26:14.204
so it was kind of squishy
around the edges.

26:14.206 --> 26:17.608
Plus, not showing up for his own
brother's murder trial?

26:17.610 --> 26:19.043
Hmm. Looks like he didn't
want to be noticed.

26:19.045 --> 26:20.244
[ Beep ]
Okay, here he is.

Three arrests for assault
and one for weapons possession.

Nothing since 2009,
though, ma'am.

26:28.854 --> 26:30.988
And now he's
a religious leader.

26:30.990 --> 26:34.091
Did Daniel and all his gang
find Jesus at once?

26:34.093 --> 26:36.694
Flynn: Or did they find
a safe place to land

26:36.696 --> 26:38.562
to process
and distribute heroin?

26:38.564 --> 26:40.264
Not to mention
money laundering.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.932
Any luck?

26:41.934 --> 26:44.868
This heroin is from the 28th
street bloods operation,

26:44.870 --> 26:46.670
but the boy who sold it to me
already has defense lawyers.

26:46.672 --> 26:48.072
Plural.

26:48.074 --> 26:50.741
And the dope has all been
measured out in doses,

26:50.743 --> 26:53.143
so I'm sure it's cut and won't
match what was in tamika's car,

26:53.145 --> 26:54.745
which was close to pure.
