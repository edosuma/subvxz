00:35.814 --> 00:38.366
We now return to <i>Bottom Chef.</i>

00:38.400 --> 00:40.935
Daniel L.,
please pack your fudge and go.

00:40.969 --> 00:42.520
Fine!

00:42.554 --> 00:44.839
We interrupt this
broadcast with breaking news.

00:44.873 --> 00:47.141
An aide to Mayor
Adam West has been found

00:47.176 --> 00:48.976
stabbed to death
at the mayor's mansion.

00:49.011 --> 00:49.961
That's right, Tom.

00:49.995 --> 00:51.245
Police say the
victim was killed

00:51.280 --> 00:53.114
by a knife
belonging to the mayor,

00:53.148 --> 00:55.817
who is considered the
prime suspect at this time.

00:55.851 --> 00:57.018
Oh, my God.

00:57.052 --> 00:58.136
Uncle Adam!

00:58.187 --> 00:59.170
Uhp, town emergency.

00:59.204 --> 01:00.454
Don't got to
finish my green beans.

01:00.489 --> 01:02.857
Peter, you stay there and
finish those green beans.

01:02.891 --> 01:06.210
But my stomach's upset
on account of the news.

01:06.245 --> 01:07.945
Also found
in the mayor's residence

01:07.980 --> 01:09.814
was a blackmail note
from the victim

01:09.848 --> 01:11.315
threatening to expose the mayor

01:11.350 --> 01:14.085
in a corruption scandal
unless the victim was paid off.

01:14.119 --> 01:15.720
You can put a picture of a note

01:15.754 --> 01:17.989
above my shoulder any time now,
Tony.

01:18.023 --> 01:20.024
No, that's the Rose Bowl Parade.

01:20.058 --> 01:21.893
That's the Pumpkin Festival.

01:21.927 --> 01:24.195
Okay, okay,
you think that humiliates me?

01:24.229 --> 01:25.263
You-- I-I don't care.

01:25.297 --> 01:26.497
Oscar De La Hoya does it.

01:26.532 --> 01:28.266
We now go live to
Tricia Takanawa,

01:28.300 --> 01:30.334
who is outside
the mayor's mansion.

01:30.369 --> 01:33.304
Tom, I'm standing outside
the mayor's mansion,

01:33.338 --> 01:35.456
where, against the wishes
of his attorneys,

01:35.490 --> 01:38.843
the mayor has agreed to an
impromptu press conference.

01:40.712 --> 01:41.762
What do you
know about the murder?

01:41.796 --> 01:43.197
Did you
kill that man?

01:43.232 --> 01:45.166
Yes, I'll take a question
from the reporter

01:45.200 --> 01:48.052
from the <i>Quahog</i>
<i>Elementary School Gazette.</i>

01:48.086 --> 01:49.053
Timmy?

01:49.087 --> 01:50.788
Are you afraid of the dark?

01:50.822 --> 01:52.590
I thought
we had an understanding

01:52.624 --> 01:54.358
that the dark was off limits.

01:54.393 --> 01:56.744
This press conference is over.

01:56.778 --> 01:59.780
This has been
Tricia Takanawa with the news.

01:59.814 --> 02:02.516
And now I will have
my normal post-news review

02:02.551 --> 02:04.485
from my mom in her car.

02:04.519 --> 02:05.686
You no good!

02:05.721 --> 02:07.021
You no good on news!

02:07.055 --> 02:08.955
You stiff, like
watching board!

02:08.991 --> 02:10.725
Joan London
mother, so happy.

02:10.758 --> 02:14.228
Tricia Takanawa
mother, so sad.

02:14.263 --> 02:16.063
Wow, he really did it.

02:16.098 --> 02:17.965
I always knew Mayor West
was a little crazy,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.568
but I never thought he was
capable of something like this.

02:20.602 --> 02:22.203
The mayor's going to jail.

02:22.237 --> 02:24.121
That means anything goes.

02:28.327 --> 02:30.011
I pushed a lady.

02:30.045 --> 02:31.963
God, I can already
hear the jokes

02:31.997 --> 02:34.081
Jay Leno's gonna be
telling about our mayor.

02:34.116 --> 02:35.116
Oh, yeah,
like what?

02:35.150 --> 02:36.234
Oh, you know,

02:36.285 --> 02:37.451
it's like you can
already hear them.

02:37.486 --> 02:38.569
You know?
Like what?

02:38.620 --> 02:40.020
Like exactly
what jokes do you hear?

02:40.038 --> 02:41.405
Tell me one of the jokes.

02:41.456 --> 02:43.574
Brian, all I have to do is
start fake sneezing around you

02:43.609 --> 02:46.093
and you'll spend the rest
of your life outside.

02:46.128 --> 02:48.262
Oh, yeah, yeah, I can
hear some of the jokes.

02:48.297 --> 02:49.747
Well, I guess
you just never know

02:49.781 --> 02:52.166
what kind of rage
some people have bottled up.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.584
Well, we all
got anger, Chris.

02:53.619 --> 02:54.619
The important thing

02:54.653 --> 02:56.420
is finding a healthy way
to channel it.

02:56.471 --> 02:59.140
For me, as you know,
it's the family bath.

02:59.174 --> 03:01.375
Peter, how long
do we have to sit here?

03:01.410 --> 03:02.777
Until I'm
not angry anymore,

03:02.811 --> 03:04.845
you naked
bunch of bitches!

03:06.000 --> 03:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:16.842 --> 03:18.759
Everyone,
please be seated.

03:18.794 --> 03:20.194
We will now hear

03:20.228 --> 03:22.330
the defense attorney's
closing statement.

03:22.364 --> 03:23.731
I switched seats.

03:23.765 --> 03:26.100
In closing, although
it seems pretty clear

03:26.134 --> 03:27.735
that my client
committed this murder,

03:27.769 --> 03:29.503
I would consider it
a personal favor to me

03:29.538 --> 03:31.122
if you found
him not guilty.

03:31.173 --> 03:34.425
That's your
closing argument?

03:34.459 --> 03:38.279
Whoa, those karate
lessons are really paying off.

03:38.313 --> 03:40.314
Thank you, Sensei.

03:40.349 --> 03:41.449
Welcome.

03:41.483 --> 03:42.583
He came.

03:42.617 --> 03:44.168
Jurors, you
have now heard

03:44.202 --> 03:45.636
all the facts
of this case.

03:45.671 --> 03:48.172
I remind you that because
we are a small town,

03:48.206 --> 03:49.507
many of you may have ties

03:49.541 --> 03:51.242
with the defendant
or the victim.

03:51.276 --> 03:53.494
You must set aside
these personal connections

03:53.528 --> 03:56.030
and render an impartial
and unanimous verdict.

03:56.064 --> 03:57.665
Does anyone have any questions?

03:57.699 --> 04:00.835
Yeah, is Toblerone
the fanciest thing in the world?

04:00.869 --> 04:02.103
I-I just don't understand.

04:02.137 --> 04:03.721
How could
Uncle Adam do this?

04:03.755 --> 04:05.356
He's the mayor
of our town.

04:05.390 --> 04:07.591
Well, Meg, life
isn't always as simple

04:07.626 --> 04:09.260
as what they
teach you at school.

04:09.294 --> 04:10.328
I don't know, Mom.

04:10.362 --> 04:12.496
I have a pretty realistic
home ec class.

04:12.531 --> 04:13.931
Okay, kids.

04:13.965 --> 04:17.067
Now I'm gonna take
the casserole out of the oven.

04:17.101 --> 04:18.786
Okay, it's a little burned.

04:18.820 --> 04:20.237
No reason to panic.

04:21.773 --> 04:22.740
Oh, God, that's Daddy.

04:22.774 --> 04:24.091
He's home early.

04:24.125 --> 04:25.893
Let-Let's get some spices
in here and fix this.

04:26.928 --> 04:28.128
Okay, he's inside the house.

04:28.146 --> 04:29.480
Let's-let's hope his meeting
went well.

04:29.514 --> 04:31.315
God, that meeting
went awful!

04:31.350 --> 04:32.350
Oh, boy.

04:32.384 --> 04:33.417
What's that smell?

04:33.452 --> 04:34.852
Did you burn dinner,
you stupid pig?

04:34.886 --> 04:36.136
Okay, kids, put your heads down.

04:36.154 --> 04:37.154
Put your heads down.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.456
And don't try to stand between

04:38.490 --> 04:40.257
me and your father;
it'll just make it worse.

04:46.314 --> 04:49.150
So I's been asked by the judge
to be the foreman,

04:49.184 --> 04:51.218
and I want y'all to know
that we's gonna run

04:51.253 --> 04:55.156
a fair jury and a clean jury,
so I brought some wet naps

04:55.190 --> 04:57.391
for everyone to wipe off
their areas.

04:57.426 --> 05:00.561
'Cause one of us gets sick,
we's all gonna get sick.

05:00.595 --> 05:01.996
And that may lead to some of us

05:02.030 --> 05:03.564
getting sicker than others.

05:03.598 --> 05:04.999
Look, can we
get this underway?

05:05.033 --> 05:06.467
I mean, we were
all in that courtroom.

05:06.501 --> 05:07.701
What-what is
there to discuss?

05:07.736 --> 05:08.736
It's obvious
he did it.

05:11.373 --> 05:12.893
Plus, I got to get
back to the station.

05:12.908 --> 05:14.175
If I'm not there by 5:00,

05:14.209 --> 05:15.543
Joyce will anchor the news,
and I don't think

05:15.577 --> 05:17.445
anyone wants
that to happen again.

05:17.479 --> 05:20.114
Our top story:
Guys, right?

05:20.148 --> 05:21.482
Yes, it's open and shut.

05:21.516 --> 05:23.551
Now let's just vote him guilty
and get out of here.

05:23.585 --> 05:24.946
Look, I know
everyone's in a hurry,

05:24.953 --> 05:26.821
but shouldn't we at least
go over the evidence

05:26.855 --> 05:28.856
once before we vote,
just to be fair?

05:28.890 --> 05:31.025
You know what would shed
some light on th case?

05:31.059 --> 05:33.177
If we huck water balloons
at people in the street.

05:35.847 --> 05:37.581
They were carrying a trampoline.

05:37.616 --> 05:38.649
Here's the facts:

05:38.683 --> 05:40.251
there was a note
from the victim,

05:40.285 --> 05:43.254
threatening to expose the mayor
in a corruption scandal.

05:43.288 --> 05:45.906
The murder weapon
was the mayor's own knife.

05:45.941 --> 05:49.376
And finally, that lady with
the Peter Gallagher eyebrows

05:49.411 --> 05:52.146
on the witness stand
saw the whole thing.

05:52.180 --> 05:53.460
Okay, let's get
down to business.

05:53.482 --> 05:55.716
All in favor of "guilty,"
raise your hands.

05:55.750 --> 05:56.984
Guilty.

05:57.018 --> 05:58.352
All "guilty."

05:58.386 --> 05:59.553
Good, well, that's it,
let's get out of here.

05:59.588 --> 06:01.188
Anyone for "not guilty"?

06:08.613 --> 06:09.997
What the hell?

06:10.031 --> 06:12.566
All right, looks like
we's gonna be here a while.

06:12.601 --> 06:14.068
Who wants pizza for dinner?

06:15.387 --> 06:18.522
And who wants
Purina Moist and Meaty Dog Chow?

06:22.961 --> 06:24.295
I had that
for breakfast!

06:31.023 --> 06:32.263
What do you mean "not guilty"?!

06:32.274 --> 06:33.241
What's wrong with you?

06:33.275 --> 06:35.343
Oh, shoot,
that was a stomachache.

06:35.377 --> 06:36.811
I told that guy he had polio.

06:36.845 --> 06:39.046
Look, the system specifies
the defendant

06:39.081 --> 06:41.749
must be proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt.

06:41.783 --> 06:43.818
Mayor West's life
is on the line here.

06:43.852 --> 06:45.987
I'm just saying,
it's possible he didn't do it.

06:47.623 --> 06:49.240
That's for the jury
to decide.

06:49.274 --> 06:50.825
Mayor West is crazy.

06:50.859 --> 06:53.077
He should've been locked up
a long time ago.

06:53.111 --> 06:54.912
Yeah, there's definitely
something off about him.

06:54.947 --> 06:56.013
I'm his physician.

06:56.048 --> 06:58.816
Okay, now we'll just
test those reflexes.

06:58.850 --> 07:00.184
Hey, did you hear that?

07:00.218 --> 07:01.218
There's someone out there.

07:01.253 --> 07:02.320
Hello?

07:02.354 --> 07:03.654
We're in here!

07:03.689 --> 07:05.089
There are six of us!

07:05.157 --> 07:07.141
Look, we all saw
that blackmail note.

07:07.175 --> 07:08.943
Mayor West is
the only one with a motive.

07:08.977 --> 07:10.378
I don't even know
why we're discussing it.

07:10.412 --> 07:12.997
Well, was Mayor West
the only one with a motive?

07:13.031 --> 07:14.765
I mean, there are
people who would benefit

07:14.800 --> 07:16.200
if he were
put away for murder.

07:16.234 --> 07:18.085
Political rivals,
special interests.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.071
I mean, it's possible
he could have been framed.

07:23.108 --> 07:24.725
Enough!

07:24.760 --> 07:26.827
Was a movie with Jennifer Lopez

07:26.862 --> 07:28.896
that did not
live up to expectations.

07:28.898 --> 07:31.899
Well, Mayor West did say
he never saw the letter.

07:31.933 --> 07:33.200
And he was under oath.

07:33.235 --> 07:34.235
Yeah, he lied.

07:34.269 --> 07:35.886
Of course he lied;
he's a politician.

07:35.921 --> 07:37.288
They're all liars.
Yeah!

07:37.322 --> 07:39.774
John F. Kennedy swore he'd serve
a full four-year term.

07:39.808 --> 07:41.208
Liar.

07:41.243 --> 07:44.011
Look, we should be sticking
to the facts, not stereotypes.

07:44.046 --> 07:46.964
It's unfair to say
that all politicians are liars,

07:46.998 --> 07:48.632
therefore Mayor West is guilty.

07:48.666 --> 07:49.984
Brian's right.

07:50.018 --> 07:53.120
I was a county alderman once
and I never told no fibs.

07:53.155 --> 07:55.022
I bent over
backwards and forwards

07:55.057 --> 07:56.324
for them constituents.

07:56.358 --> 07:58.559
It's important
to make sure everyone is happy,

07:58.593 --> 08:00.328
so I took a lot of polls.

08:00.362 --> 08:01.662
Gay stuff.

08:01.697 --> 08:04.498
Yeah, and I served honorably
as a U.N. interpreter.

08:06.968 --> 08:08.803
Okay, he's mad about something.

08:08.837 --> 08:10.971
He appears to be
talking really fast.

08:11.006 --> 08:13.741
He spits whenever
he makes the "ch" noise,

08:13.775 --> 08:16.310
which, in this language,
happens a lot.

08:16.345 --> 08:18.446
I'm expected to entertain him
and his wife tonight,

08:18.480 --> 08:20.815
so if anyone knows a good
restaurant in the area...

08:20.849 --> 08:22.983
Sushi or tapas,
something where they're always

08:23.018 --> 08:24.135
bringing stuff to the table

08:24.169 --> 08:25.436
so you have something
to talk about.

08:25.470 --> 08:26.637
You know?

08:26.671 --> 08:28.239
"Hey, what's this?
This looks good..."

08:28.273 --> 08:29.507
War, oh, war, war!

08:29.541 --> 08:31.459
That last sentence
was about war!

08:31.493 --> 08:33.210
Look, an expert
confirmed

08:33.245 --> 08:35.212
that the blackmail note
was signed by the victim.

08:35.246 --> 08:37.313
That points
irrefutably to West.

08:37.349 --> 08:39.482
Well, maybe we should
take a look at that letter.

08:39.518 --> 08:40.818
Yeah, I'd like to see that.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.287
'Cause I can read it
just like everybody else.

08:43.321 --> 08:45.556
<i>And the charade continues.</i>

08:45.590 --> 08:47.942
Bailiff, please.

08:47.993 --> 08:49.059
Yeah?

08:49.077 --> 08:50.995
Mr. Bailiff, we
request that you

08:51.029 --> 08:52.630
bring us the note
from the victim.

08:52.664 --> 08:54.682
Joe, what the hell
are you doing out there?

08:54.716 --> 08:56.283
You're a cop, not a bailiff.

08:56.318 --> 08:57.518
Eh, I'm undercover.

08:57.552 --> 08:59.353
Someone's been raping
all the bailiffs.

08:59.388 --> 09:01.689
So you're just sitting around
waiting to be raped?

09:01.723 --> 09:03.391
Hey, Bailiff,
can I talk to you

09:03.425 --> 09:05.226
for a second in
this broom closet?

09:05.260 --> 09:06.494
Sure, strange man.

09:06.528 --> 09:10.231
I can't wait to hear
what this is all about.

09:15.587 --> 09:16.971
Well, there's your motive.

09:17.022 --> 09:19.039
A note from the victim
threatening Mayor West.

09:19.074 --> 09:20.408
What more proof
do you want?

09:20.442 --> 09:22.376
Yeah, are you trying to
suggest that Mayor West's

09:22.411 --> 09:23.878
enemy faked
a corruption letter

09:23.912 --> 09:24.979
and then
killed himself?

09:25.013 --> 09:26.013
That's idiotic!

09:28.934 --> 09:31.836
But it just might work.

09:31.870 --> 09:32.937
What?

09:39.478 --> 09:40.845
You know, something bothered me

09:40.879 --> 09:42.513
about the stationery
that note was on,

09:42.547 --> 09:44.148
with the-the decorative
"M" border.

09:44.182 --> 09:45.182
It's from the
office of the mayor.

09:45.217 --> 09:46.217
The "M" is for "mayor."

09:46.251 --> 09:47.785
What are you
getting at?

09:47.819 --> 09:49.620
No, no, I'm pretty sure
the "M" is for "Marriott."

09:49.654 --> 09:51.589
How do you know?
Because I once got a note

09:51.623 --> 09:55.726
from the Marriott
written on the same paper.

09:57.129 --> 09:58.462
"Dear Brian.

09:58.497 --> 09:59.947
"You were amazing last night.

09:59.981 --> 10:01.115
Love, Ida."

10:01.149 --> 10:02.349
This is from the night

10:02.400 --> 10:04.368
you had sex with Quagmire's dad.

10:04.402 --> 10:05.619
Ah, come on!

10:05.654 --> 10:08.055
I did a dog once,
but I was in the Philippines,

10:08.089 --> 10:09.590
and I sure as hell
didn't write him a letter.

10:09.624 --> 10:11.459
What's-- w-w-what, so
what does that prove?

10:11.526 --> 10:12.593
The victim had access

10:12.627 --> 10:13.928
to all the "Office of the Mayor"

10:13.962 --> 10:15.229
stationery he could ever want,

10:15.263 --> 10:17.164
yet he hand-made a letterhead

10:17.199 --> 10:19.166
on stationery from a Marriott?

10:19.201 --> 10:21.001
As far as I'm concerned,
that casts doubt.

10:23.688 --> 10:25.072
Look, you guys
just say the word

10:25.106 --> 10:27.091
and I'll put this ball with
cheese in it on the floor.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.109
We won't hear from him
for an hour and a half.

10:32.164 --> 10:34.715
Look, if I'm still the only
one who says "not guilty,"

10:34.749 --> 10:36.650
I won't hold
things up any longer.

10:36.685 --> 10:38.469
Let's vote again,
and I'll abstain.

10:38.503 --> 10:39.703
If it's unanimous,

10:39.738 --> 10:41.655
I'll change my vote
and we can all go home.

10:41.690 --> 10:44.825
Okay, everyone take one of these
here and write their vote.

10:47.212 --> 10:50.548
Hey, Quagmire, y-you gonna
write something funny?

10:50.582 --> 10:51.916
No, Peter, I'm not.

10:51.950 --> 10:54.151
I'm starting to think
all you do is dick around.

10:54.185 --> 10:56.086
Sorry.

10:57.272 --> 10:59.023
Everyone vote?

10:59.057 --> 11:00.824
Okay, now let's count.

11:00.859 --> 11:03.711
"Guilty," "guilty."

11:03.745 --> 11:06.580
Some hurtful slurs followed
by the word "guilty."

11:07.616 --> 11:09.984
"Guilty," "guilty."

11:10.018 --> 11:11.619
"El guilto."

11:11.653 --> 11:13.821
"Guilty," "guilty."

11:13.855 --> 11:16.106
This one's just a squiggly line.

11:16.141 --> 11:19.343
That's, uh,
that's "guilty" in Latin.

11:19.377 --> 11:21.946
<i>You're playing</i>
<i>a dangerous game, Carl.</i>

11:21.980 --> 11:23.280
"Guilty."

11:23.315 --> 11:25.182
"Not guilty."

11:29.104 --> 11:30.321
Ew!

11:30.355 --> 11:32.223
I farted during the murmuring.

11:32.257 --> 11:34.358
What monumental douche
voted "not guilty"

11:34.392 --> 11:35.726
on this no-brainer?

11:35.760 --> 11:38.212
I think we know who
the flip-flopper is.

11:38.246 --> 11:40.381
Bruce didn't change his vote.

11:40.415 --> 11:42.049
I did.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.553
I respect Brian's courage.

11:45.587 --> 11:47.555
It's not easy to stand alone.

11:47.589 --> 11:50.124
Or find the child
who stands alone.

11:50.158 --> 11:52.860
But that's the one you want.

11:52.894 --> 11:55.663
Look, we have been cooped up
in this room for five hours now.

11:55.697 --> 11:58.315
I'm starting to feel
like an animal in a cage.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.718
Yeah, or a T. rex
trying to masturbate.

12:00.752 --> 12:03.304
All right,
Internet porn-- check.

12:03.338 --> 12:05.089
Tissues-- check.

12:05.123 --> 12:06.790
Lotion-- check.

12:06.825 --> 12:08.809
Okay, let's go.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.246
Aw.

12:18.086 --> 12:20.654
And that's why they were
such vicious killers.

12:20.689 --> 12:24.124
♪ Oh, he couldn't masturbate
because his arms are too short ♪

12:24.159 --> 12:26.043
♪ They feared him
from Kilpatrick ♪

12:26.077 --> 12:27.778
♪ Down to Galway Bay Port

12:27.812 --> 12:31.115
♪ Luckily he found a wife
so he could have sex ♪

12:31.149 --> 12:32.750
♪ The non-masturbatin'

12:32.784 --> 12:35.352
♪ Tyrannosaurus rex.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.688
Okay, look, tempers are starting
to get a little heated,

12:37.722 --> 12:40.457
so why don't we all go take us
a little potty break?

12:40.492 --> 12:42.242
Now you're all gonna have
to witness me taking

12:42.277 --> 12:45.346
an old-man pill that looks
way too big to swallow.

12:54.122 --> 12:56.290
Oh, there we go.

12:59.577 --> 13:01.178
It's his fault
we're still here.

13:01.212 --> 13:03.280
How is it you think
you know everything anyway?

13:03.315 --> 13:05.783
You don't even understand
your feelings for the mailman.

13:08.203 --> 13:09.520
You  get out of here!

13:09.554 --> 13:10.688
I'll kill you!

13:10.722 --> 13:12.056
But come back
tomorrow same time.

13:12.090 --> 13:14.892
I get very sad on Sundays
when you're not here.

13:14.926 --> 13:16.193
Aw, damn it.

13:16.227 --> 13:17.227
What happened?

13:17.262 --> 13:19.380
I dropped my phone
in the toilet.

13:20.715 --> 13:23.617
Oh, it's so cold and
it's under everything.

13:23.652 --> 13:26.654
I feel like I'm rooting
around a pitcher of sangria.

13:26.688 --> 13:28.756
Where is it?

13:28.790 --> 13:31.191
Oh, my God, why haven't
I found it yet?

13:31.226 --> 13:33.894
Oh, no, I didn't roll
my sleeve up far enough.

13:33.928 --> 13:37.064
Oh, why didn't I flush
when I got in here?

13:37.098 --> 13:39.500
Aw, this isn't even all mine!

13:39.534 --> 13:42.069
Oh, no, there's a spider
crawling on my face.

13:42.103 --> 13:45.506
Aah, why didn't I use the
hand that was on the floor?!

13:45.540 --> 13:47.608
Why did I use
my toilet hand?!

13:47.642 --> 13:50.010
Oh, wait, here it is
behind the toilet.

13:55.583 --> 13:56.867
This is ridiculous.

13:56.901 --> 13:58.702
Even if you don't believe
the note was legitimate,

13:58.737 --> 14:01.255
there was an eyewitness
who saw the entire thing.

14:01.289 --> 14:03.290
Well, I have questions
about her testimony.

14:03.324 --> 14:04.958
She said she was at a party.

14:04.993 --> 14:06.994
Not just any party--
a sex party.

14:07.028 --> 14:09.446
Now, how could a woman
at an orgy witness a murder?

14:09.481 --> 14:11.682
The bedroom was a hundred feet
from the window.

14:11.716 --> 14:13.901
Okay, first of all,
the term "orgy" is outdated.

14:13.935 --> 14:16.120
We call them
"genital jamborees."

14:16.154 --> 14:17.788
But still, I don't see
how she could look out

14:17.822 --> 14:19.390
a window and witness a crime.

14:19.424 --> 14:21.575
Trust me, you're banging
eight strangers who responded

14:21.609 --> 14:23.944
to a flyer, at some point
you're gonna look out a window

14:23.978 --> 14:26.046
and question every decision
you've ever made.

14:26.081 --> 14:27.064
Look, I'll demonstrate.

14:27.098 --> 14:28.549
You people come here.

14:28.583 --> 14:31.051
Okay, Tom, you're over
here on all fours.

14:31.086 --> 14:32.820
Carter, I need
your face right here.

14:32.854 --> 14:34.104
Nope, even closer.

14:34.139 --> 14:36.039
You're gonna want to feel
the heat coming off him.

14:36.074 --> 14:38.659
Okay, Consuela, I'm gonna
need you on your knees.

14:38.693 --> 14:40.254
And we're probably
partway into it here,

14:40.261 --> 14:42.329
so one of your eyes
is stuck shut.

14:42.363 --> 14:45.365
All the way shut-- there
are 11 of us, dear.

14:46.935 --> 14:49.269
All right, Tom,
you're squinting.

14:49.304 --> 14:50.571
You're anticipating--
don't-don't do that.

14:50.605 --> 14:52.473
Carl, you can take your fist
out of your own mouth.

14:52.507 --> 14:53.507
Bruce, great work.

14:53.541 --> 14:55.442
Bruce seems like
the only gamer here.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.911
Thanks, it's okay
to look the other way

14:57.946 --> 15:00.414
when y'all pass me on the
street with y'all's wives.

15:00.448 --> 15:01.682
I understand.

15:01.716 --> 15:03.600
And that places
the witness right here,

15:03.618 --> 15:04.858
next to the lubricating station

15:04.869 --> 15:06.353
and the terrible
smelling guest book.

15:06.387 --> 15:07.421
Would she be face up?

15:07.455 --> 15:09.173
No, she had small breasts
but a great ass.

15:09.207 --> 15:10.741
She's definitely face down.

15:10.775 --> 15:13.110
But then, how could
she see the window?

15:13.144 --> 15:15.479
Oh, my God.

15:15.513 --> 15:16.780
You're right.

15:16.815 --> 15:18.182
She couldn't have.

15:21.786 --> 15:23.887
And now to take
my position.

15:23.922 --> 15:25.906
This is what I call
the Butter Pat.

15:36.891 --> 15:39.392
Okay, y'all, so we's
now at six "guilty,"

15:39.427 --> 15:40.927
six "not guilty."

15:40.961 --> 15:42.695
So we's all gonna
have to stay here

15:42.730 --> 15:44.864
until we's unanimous
in our verdict.

15:44.899 --> 15:46.699
Well, so what if that woman
at the orgy couldn't see?

15:46.734 --> 15:49.202
There's plenty of other evidence
that West is guilty.

15:49.236 --> 15:51.104
Yeah, let's wrap this up--
I got the director's cut

15:51.138 --> 15:53.706
of <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>
waiting for me at home.

15:56.243 --> 15:58.194
Don't look, Marion.
Okay.

15:58.245 --> 16:00.163
By the way, I'm pregnant.

16:00.197 --> 16:02.315
Maybe just one quick peak.

16:02.349 --> 16:04.217
Come on, people,
he obviously did it.

16:04.251 --> 16:05.985
You know his type--
they're all guilty.

16:06.020 --> 16:07.487
Well, what type is that?

16:07.521 --> 16:08.988
He's one of those plain-lippies.

16:09.023 --> 16:11.191
You know, no mustache
like a normal person.

16:11.225 --> 16:13.026
Prancing around
with his naked lip out

16:13.060 --> 16:14.294
for all the world to see.

16:14.328 --> 16:17.330
Sir, you are talking
to a plain-lippy.

16:17.364 --> 16:18.644
Oh, now,
don't take it like that.

16:18.666 --> 16:20.133
Some of them are all right.

16:20.167 --> 16:22.452
But you know what I mean--
they're all over the place.

16:22.486 --> 16:24.471
How about me, Tucker--
am I all right?

16:24.538 --> 16:26.139
Well, of course
you're all right.

16:28.843 --> 16:31.478
Huh, imagine that.

16:32.746 --> 16:34.247
What happened to me?

16:34.281 --> 16:37.167
I've become my father.

16:37.218 --> 16:39.669
Not guilty.

16:39.703 --> 16:42.522
That really hurt because
it was a real mustache.

16:42.556 --> 16:44.457
Okay, the majority
of this room now believes

16:44.492 --> 16:47.193
that there is reasonable doubt
about Mayor West's guilt.

16:47.228 --> 16:48.549
And what do
the rest of you think?

16:48.562 --> 16:50.680
Look, I just don't think
he could've done it.

16:50.714 --> 16:51.881
Guilty.

16:53.033 --> 16:54.701
Oh, oh, guilty is
the other one?

16:54.735 --> 16:56.870
Well, I don't know!

16:56.904 --> 16:58.638
Okay, it's good
we're talking this out.

16:58.672 --> 17:00.473
Now I'd really like to hear
from the holdouts

17:00.508 --> 17:02.509
because a man's life hangs
in the bal...

17:02.543 --> 17:03.710
Peter, what are you doing?

17:03.744 --> 17:05.377
It's getting very tense in here.

17:05.412 --> 17:07.914
Do you guys mind if I struggle
to open these blinds?

17:23.247 --> 17:25.498
Damn it, come on, stay up there.

17:25.532 --> 17:27.183
You got to yank it
to the side, Peter.

17:27.218 --> 17:28.451
I'm yanking it
as far as it goes.

17:28.484 --> 17:29.953
You got to catch
it on the thing.

17:30.004 --> 17:31.538
Oh, that's helpful.

17:31.572 --> 17:33.606
The left side's getting
lower than the right side.

17:33.641 --> 17:34.774
I can see what's happening.

17:34.808 --> 17:35.775
Now twist it.

17:35.809 --> 17:37.577
All right.

17:37.611 --> 17:38.978
See? Now it's open.

17:41.849 --> 17:43.850
Okay, we's
at 11 to one.

17:43.884 --> 17:47.020
Carter, you're the only person
who still thinks he's guilty.

17:47.054 --> 17:49.222
You're damn right I do--
look at the facts.

17:49.256 --> 17:51.591
There was a dead guy found
in Mayor West's home.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.359
There's no one else
with any motive.

17:53.394 --> 17:55.428
And the police detective who
examined all the evidence

17:55.462 --> 17:57.096
named him the prime suspect.

17:57.131 --> 17:59.432
You guys paid
attention that whole trial?

17:59.466 --> 18:00.934
Lame-- not me.

18:00.968 --> 18:02.702
I was too busy
being cool.

18:02.736 --> 18:04.737
The jury is instructed
to disregard

18:04.772 --> 18:06.472
the witness' last remark.

18:06.507 --> 18:08.308
Yeah, whatever, Judge.

18:08.342 --> 18:10.710
None of this stuff's ever
gonna apply to my real life.

18:10.744 --> 18:13.396
I'm just gonna go work in
the mines anyway like my dad.

18:13.430 --> 18:15.882
How would you like to stay
for an hour after the trial?

18:15.916 --> 18:17.800
Oh, I'm real scared.

18:17.835 --> 18:20.003
Is your dad
hitting you, Peter?

18:20.037 --> 18:21.487
Shut up, just shut up!

18:21.522 --> 18:23.022
You have no right, man!

18:23.057 --> 18:25.358
You don't know nothing
about my side of town!

18:25.392 --> 18:27.160
Look, he's guilty,
I just know it.

18:27.194 --> 18:29.846
He's a double-dealing
spineless politician.

18:29.880 --> 18:31.197
But how do you know
he's guilty?

18:31.231 --> 18:32.181
Oh, I know.

18:32.216 --> 18:34.317
Mayor West has
let people down.

18:34.351 --> 18:36.886
Guys, I feel like all
we talk about is Mayor West.

18:36.921 --> 18:38.371
Like who, who has he let down?

18:38.439 --> 18:40.006
Someone who got him elected.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.658
Someone who padded
his expense account.

18:41.692 --> 18:43.626
And all I wanted was
to fire a missile

18:43.661 --> 18:46.212
into a fault line to sink half
of Quahog into the ocean

18:46.246 --> 18:48.264
and make
my real estate waterfront.

18:48.299 --> 18:49.949
You got that from <i>Superman.</i>

18:49.984 --> 18:51.017
Nobody likes you.

18:51.051 --> 18:52.018
I even let him marry

18:52.052 --> 18:53.486
my daughter
Carol, damn it.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.021
I mean, doesn't that
mean anything?

18:55.055 --> 18:57.857
No, not to West, that
ungrateful bastard.

18:57.891 --> 18:59.859
It wasn't that aide that
got stabbed in the back,

18:59.893 --> 19:01.928
it was me!

19:05.482 --> 19:07.500
Not guilty.

19:08.535 --> 19:11.037
Well, I guess that's it.

19:11.071 --> 19:13.539
Yeah, looks like
we've reached our verdict.

19:13.574 --> 19:14.807
You know what
I just realized?

19:14.842 --> 19:16.876
My jury duty's tomorrow.

19:19.847 --> 19:22.031
Ladies and gentlemen of Quahog,

19:22.066 --> 19:23.599
I feel vindicated.

19:23.634 --> 19:26.102
Today the truth has prevailed.

19:26.136 --> 19:28.805
And we've witnessed
the power of the greatest

19:28.839 --> 19:31.007
justice system in all the world.

19:32.926 --> 19:34.377
Yes, Miss Takanawa.

19:34.411 --> 19:35.845
Now that you've been acquitted,

19:35.879 --> 19:39.282
what does the future hold
for Mayor Adam West?

19:39.316 --> 19:41.784
Oh, I don't know.

19:41.819 --> 19:45.872
♪ Into the great wide open

19:47.391 --> 19:51.961
♪ Under them skies of blue

19:53.163 --> 19:57.417
♪ Out in the great wide open

19:59.153 --> 20:02.388
♪ A rebel without a clue.

20:04.174 --> 20:07.377
I'll probably just remain mayor
of this great city.

20:07.411 --> 20:10.680
This also is part
of my fantasy sequence.

20:13.083 --> 20:16.853
I'll probably just remain
mayor of this great city.

20:16.887 --> 20:20.723
And I know this is real because
you're not rabbit-people.

20:24.328 --> 20:25.862
Ah, what a day.

20:25.896 --> 20:29.232
You both did your civic duty
and you saved Mayor West.

20:29.266 --> 20:30.950
Yeah, I mean, it was
a pretty intense experience,

20:30.984 --> 20:32.902
but the important thing is,
in the end,

20:32.936 --> 20:34.170
justice was served.

20:34.204 --> 20:35.988
All you did was
let a guy go.

20:36.023 --> 20:37.690
There's still
a murderer out there.

20:37.725 --> 20:40.093
Yeah, but we saved
an innocent man today.

20:40.127 --> 20:41.461
And that's something
to feel good about.

20:41.495 --> 20:42.762
"Feel good about"?

20:42.796 --> 20:44.642
They found eight more
bodies last night.

20:44.997 --> 20:46.515
One of them was
on this block.

20:46.549 --> 20:49.160
There's a maniac out there.
He's cutting people's power off,

20:49.256 --> 20:51.380
breaking into their homes,
and slitting their throats.

20:53.323 --> 20:55.291
And we're dead.
