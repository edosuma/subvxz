Anyway, this could be

the perfect role

05:52.769 --> 05:54.855
'Cause money's tied up in it,

05:52.769 --> 05:54.855

NARRATOR:

05:54.855 --> 05:57.191
<i>Which brings us here, now.</i>

05:57.191 --> 05:58.692
Okay,

05:57.191 --> 05:58.692
just be prepared--

05:58.692 --> 06:00.527
the staff isn't going

05:58.692 --> 06:00.527
to like it.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.903
Oh, don't worry.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.903
Last week,

06:01.903 --> 06:03.530
I threatened to cancel

06:01.903 --> 06:03.530
Jane's mom's gig

06:03.530 --> 06:05.364
unless she publicly backed

06:03.530 --> 06:05.364
the Flamingo Initiative.

NARRATOR:

06:05.364 --> 06:07.826
<i>What the hell is</i>

06:05.364 --> 06:07.826
<i>the Flamingo Initiative?</i>

06:07.826 --> 06:11.454
So, guys, we're damn near sold

06:07.826 --> 06:11.454
out for our first theme night--

06:11.454 --> 06:13.081
Flamingo Friday.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.250
Ladies...your outfits.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.293
WOMEN:

06:15.250 --> 06:16.293
Ugh...

06:16.293 --> 06:17.585
WOMAN:

06:16.293 --> 06:17.585
What?

06:18.879 --> 06:20.630
Oh, wow. How fun.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.632
Super fun. Exactly.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.632
Thank you, Jane.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.135
Guys, we're just going

06:22.632 --> 06:25.135
no shirts, pink bowties.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.594
Just really classic sexy.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.387
On to other orders

06:26.594 --> 06:28.387
of business.

06:28.387 --> 06:29.973
We're phasing out bussers

06:28.387 --> 06:29.973
in the afternoon,

06:29.973 --> 06:31.350
so shifts are gonna be

06:29.973 --> 06:31.350
45 minutes longer.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.018
Wait,

06:31.350 --> 06:33.018
what?

06:33.018 --> 06:35.312
Don't gripe. It's economical.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.312
You'll make more bank.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.314
No, we won't. Because

06:35.312 --> 06:37.314
service will be terrible.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.274
Well, it's happening.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.274
Deal with it.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.652
This is ridiculous.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.904
You need to talk

06:42.652 --> 06:43.904
to your baby daddy.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.113
Lina, his mother just died.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.448
Fine. Your sister wife.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.448
You need to,

06:47.448 --> 06:49.743
'cause her creepy boy toy's

06:47.448 --> 06:49.743
out of control.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.203
( sighs )

06:51.203 --> 06:52.495
Sorry, Scott's the boss

06:51.203 --> 06:52.495
of the lounge.

06:52.495 --> 06:53.872
Take it up with him,

06:52.495 --> 06:53.872
not me.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.790
Petra, come on.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.790
Can't we talk about it?

06:55.790 --> 06:56.791
No.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.793
Look, I-I know things

06:58.793 --> 07:00.254
have been complicated

06:58.793 --> 07:00.254
between us.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.172
Because of

07:00.254 --> 07:02.172
what I said...

07:02.172 --> 07:04.258
you know,

07:02.172 --> 07:04.258
when we fought...

07:04.258 --> 07:05.717
before the wedding.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.886
NARRATOR:

07:05.717 --> 07:07.886
<i>A reminder: Anezka has no idea</i>

07:07.886 --> 07:09.304
<i>what she's talking about.</i>

07:09.304 --> 07:11.098
Yes. Exactly.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.307
And I get that.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.726
I-I do. I mean,

07:12.307 --> 07:14.726
it was awful of me

07:14.726 --> 07:18.855
to imply that I think that

07:14.726 --> 07:18.855
I'm a better person than you.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.441
Even just hearing it

07:18.855 --> 07:21.441
again is a shock.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.859
Yeah, but you remember

07:21.441 --> 07:22.859
what was going on.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.736
NARRATOR:<i> Not a clue.</i>

07:22.859 --> 07:24.736
Of course.

07:24.736 --> 07:27.072
And I don't want

07:24.736 --> 07:27.072
to rehash it.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.116
So let's just steer clear

07:27.072 --> 07:29.116
of each other.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.784
What?

07:29.116 --> 07:30.784
Do I have to be explicit, Jane?

07:30.784 --> 07:33.161
I don't like you.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.161
I never have liked you.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.788
Our babies share a father.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.788
That's it.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.706
Okay, you know what?

07:36.706 --> 07:37.749
Fine with me.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.167
I'm done trying with you.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.002
You're...toxic.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.670
DENNIS:

07:41.002 --> 07:42.670
<i>Poison.</i>

07:44.631 --> 07:46.633

transdermally.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.428
( camera shutter clicking )

07:46.633 --> 07:49.428
Could've been someone who

07:49.428 --> 07:51.012
bumped into your mother...

07:49.428 --> 07:51.012
Got it.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.055
I appreciate the update.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.684
Anything come to mind

07:55.350 --> 07:56.684
at all,

07:56.684 --> 07:58.228
why she would leave you

07:56.684 --> 07:58.228
that Bible?

07:58.228 --> 07:59.938
No idea.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.938
My mother wasn't religious.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.398
She was a homicidal maniac.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.482
I'm sorry,

08:01.398 --> 08:02.482
I just want to put

08:02.482 --> 08:04.025
this whole thing

08:02.482 --> 08:04.025
behind me.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.487
I didn't know her.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.487
I had no relationship with her.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.240
And it's painful,

08:07.487 --> 08:10.240
frankly.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.999

08:18.999 --> 08:23.170
It's actually not

08:18.999 --> 08:23.170
painful.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.587
I'm fine, okay?

08:24.587 --> 08:25.630
Okay.

MICHAEL:

08:25.630 --> 08:27.007
<i>Okay...</i>

08:27.007 --> 08:28.091
what do you think?

08:28.091 --> 08:29.259

You excited

08:34.264 --> 08:35.640

Listen to stories

Come in late, after curfew,

Excuse me, what are you doing

08:44.316 --> 08:47.110
barging into our house?

08:47.110 --> 08:48.778
Yeah, this definitely

08:56.661 --> 08:58.872
Okay, do not swear

08:56.661 --> 08:58.872
in front of my baby!

08:58.872 --> 09:02.376

08:58.872 --> 09:02.376
I manage this property.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.668
And we rent this property.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.086
Then how come I have no idea

09:03.668 --> 09:05.086
who you are?

09:05.086 --> 09:06.713
We put off moving here

No, it is for rent.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.011
Come on in. Come on in.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.011
Have a look around.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.471
As you can see,

09:13.011 --> 09:14.471
it's freshly painted.

JANE:

09:14.471 --> 09:15.930
No, do not look around.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.391
And that fresh paint is ours!

09:17.391 --> 09:19.351
Okay, look, there's

09:17.391 --> 09:19.351
obviously been a mix-up.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.768
We signed a lease.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.187
This is our realtor.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.939
( laughing ):

09:22.187 --> 09:24.939
Yeah. I know this guy.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.359
Reps a couple of deadbeats

09:24.939 --> 09:27.359
who stopped paying last month.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.987
Oh, that's you guys.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.739
We are not deadbeats.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.824
I personally pay

09:32.739 --> 09:34.824
a thousand dollars a month.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.326
Well, first of all,

09:34.824 --> 09:36.326
rent is 2,000 bucks.

09:36.326 --> 09:39.913
What? That's not what

09:36.326 --> 09:39.913
he told us.

09:36.326 --> 09:39.913
Okay.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.123
Please, just give us

09:39.913 --> 09:42.123
a couple days

09:42.123 --> 09:43.750
to figure this out,

09:42.123 --> 09:43.750
okay?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.210
You know

09:43.750 --> 09:45.210
where we live, heh.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.545
Heh.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.713
So until recently,

09:48.713 --> 09:50.549
someone has been covering

09:48.713 --> 09:50.549
half our rent

09:50.549 --> 09:52.800
but keeping it a secret?

09:50.549 --> 09:52.800
Who would do that?

09:52.800 --> 09:54.386
Nah, it wasn't me.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.180
He says it wasn't him.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.474
So who would...

09:59.474 --> 10:01.851
Nope, not me.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.851
But if you need me to--

10:01.851 --> 10:03.811
Oh, no, no, no, no.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.811

and hearing all about

10:14.531 --> 10:16.699

about the movie.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.496
Well, I'm here,

10:21.496 --> 10:23.540

10:21.496 --> 10:23.540
you're in the running.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.832
Well, in that case,

10:24.832 --> 10:27.586
how do I get to

10:24.832 --> 10:27.586
the finish line?

10:27.586 --> 10:29.337
That's your daughter's

10:27.586 --> 10:29.337
boyfriend, right?

10:29.337 --> 10:30.464

10:43.726 --> 10:45.437
I have a charity event

10:43.726 --> 10:45.437

10:45.437 --> 10:47.230
Nothing would give me

than to have

10:47.230 --> 10:50.024
a gorgeous man on my arm.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.112
I'm thinking Rafael.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.155

It would make me

10:55.155 --> 10:58.283
very happy.

And those vicious

10:58.283 --> 11:00.494

17:40.935 --> 17:42.353
MICHAEL:

17:40.935 --> 17:42.353
<i>Petra?</i>

17:42.353 --> 17:44.313
She and the vest guy

17:42.353 --> 17:44.313
are gonna be

17:44.313 --> 17:45.690
our first and last

17:44.313 --> 17:45.690
dinner guests?

17:45.690 --> 17:47.441
Come on, it was

17:45.690 --> 17:47.441
so nice of her.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.985
And...

17:48.985 --> 17:51.153
maybe they won't be

17:48.985 --> 17:51.153
our last dinner guests.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.279
I mean, I've been thinking.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.323
If we cut corners

17:52.279 --> 17:54.323
here and there,

17:54.323 --> 17:55.783
maybe we can stay.

17:57.535 --> 17:58.995
That's your filing system?

17:58.995 --> 18:01.706
Well, this and

17:58.995 --> 18:01.706
the other box, yeah.

18:01.706 --> 18:04.584
First things first.

18:01.706 --> 18:04.584
Fixed expenses:

18:04.584 --> 18:07.461
rent, food, gas, internet.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.461
My student loans.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.338
I thought you paid it off.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.841
One. I found out the other

18:09.338 --> 18:11.841
has another two years.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.593
NARRATOR:<i> Found out?</i>

18:11.841 --> 18:13.593
All right.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.262
So let's list

18:13.593 --> 18:16.262
all other expenses,

18:16.262 --> 18:18.222
and then

18:16.262 --> 18:18.222
we'll start cutting.

18:18.222 --> 18:21.059
No way, I<i> need</i>

18:18.222 --> 18:21.059
my NBA sports package.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.019
You don't<i> need</i> it.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.186
Have you ever heard

18:23.019 --> 18:24.186
of a library?

18:24.186 --> 18:25.605
I like to underline things.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.731
Okay, fine.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.482
( pained ):

18:26.731 --> 18:28.482
No more buying books.

18:28.482 --> 18:31.235
$170 for

18:28.482 --> 18:31.235
Mateo's Toddler Gym?

18:31.235 --> 18:34.447
I'm assuming that comes

18:31.235 --> 18:34.447
with illicit baby steroids.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.240
Yeah. Rafael pays for

18:34.447 --> 18:36.240
so much Mateo stuff.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.450
I have to cover something.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.243
Spotify or Pandora?

18:39.243 --> 18:40.453
One movie a month?

18:40.453 --> 18:41.746
Lost it.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.746
Cut it.

18:41.746 --> 18:43.998
Done. And with

18:41.746 --> 18:43.998
this new budget, we are...

18:43.998 --> 18:45.666
( hits a key,

18:43.998 --> 18:45.666
cash register sound )

18:45.666 --> 18:48.669
...still $280 short

18:45.666 --> 18:48.669
per month.

18:48.669 --> 18:49.963
( crickets chirping outside )

18:49.963 --> 18:51.547
We'll sleep on it.

18:54.008 --> 18:56.844
( Michael sighs )

18:56.844 --> 18:58.888
I think we should

18:56.844 --> 18:58.888
go to my dad.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.432
$280 a month

18:58.888 --> 19:01.432
is not a huge ask...

19:01.432 --> 19:03.392
Really?

19:01.432 --> 19:03.392
It'll be a loan.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.061
We'll absolutely pay him back.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.064
I love this place.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.356
Let's do it.

19:11.985 --> 19:15.113
While we're on the topic

19:11.985 --> 19:15.113
of doing it...

19:15.113 --> 19:17.657
NARRATOR:

19:15.113 --> 19:17.657
<i>Aw, you can't put a price</i>

19:17.657 --> 19:19.158
<i>on that kind of happiness.</i>

19:19.158 --> 19:21.661
I need to withdraw

19:19.158 --> 19:21.661
$5 million.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.496
Can you help me with that?

19:24.747 --> 19:26.582
Sure. I'd be happy to.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.001
CUSTOMER:

19:26.582 --> 19:28.001
I'm buying a yacht.

19:28.001 --> 19:31.004
And, uh...I would love

19:28.001 --> 19:31.004
to take you on it.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.089
( chuckles )

19:31.004 --> 19:33.089
NARRATOR:<i> So yeah.</i>

19:33.089 --> 19:34.799
<i>Obviously, that didn't happen.</i>

19:34.799 --> 19:37.259
Thirty...

19:37.259 --> 19:40.346
( sighs )

19:37.259 --> 19:40.346
Thirty-five...

19:40.346 --> 19:43.933
Forty. These bills

19:40.346 --> 19:43.933
are sticking together!

19:43.933 --> 19:45.559
You asked for crisp,

19:43.933 --> 19:45.559
new ones, so--

19:45.559 --> 19:48.521
Because they're for my

19:45.559 --> 19:48.521
grandson's birthday!

19:48.521 --> 19:51.065
You need to fan 'em out

19:48.521 --> 19:51.065
first.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.817
Yeah, okay.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.817
Well, next time.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.485
( groans )

19:54.485 --> 19:56.403
You forgot to say

19:54.485 --> 19:56.403
"Thank you for choosing

19:56.403 --> 19:59.281
Sunrise Mutual West Miami

19:56.403 --> 19:59.281
for your financial needs."

19:59.281 --> 20:01.492
And that's pretty important.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.492
Got it.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.911
Like, okay.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.911
You're saying "got it."

20:03.911 --> 20:05.913
But you said that

20:03.911 --> 20:05.913
last time.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.707
And then you forgot again.

20:07.707 --> 20:11.335
Well, this time

20:07.707 --> 20:11.335
I really...got it.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.379
Mm.

20:13.379 --> 20:16.007
NARRATOR:

20:13.379 --> 20:16.007
<i>Yeah. Someone made</i>

20:13.379 --> 20:16.007
<i>a big mistake.</i>

20:16.007 --> 20:17.800
ANEZKA:

20:16.007 --> 20:17.800
<i>I'd like to sell</i>

20:16.007 --> 20:17.800
<i>my share of the hotel.</i>

20:17.800 --> 20:19.468
What?

20:17.800 --> 20:19.468
And I... I know

20:19.468 --> 20:21.137
it seems sudden.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.137
Yeah. Of course it's sudden.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.430
You've been driving up

20:21.137 --> 20:23.430
all these big changes,

20:23.430 --> 20:26.017
and now you wanna sell? Why?

20:23.430 --> 20:26.017
Because of Scott, actually.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.518
It's not good for our

20:26.017 --> 20:27.518
relationship for me to be

20:27.518 --> 20:29.103
working so closely with you.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.103
I am not interested--

20:29.103 --> 20:30.563
Yes, I know.

20:29.103 --> 20:30.563
You made that very clear.

20:30.563 --> 20:34.067
Nevertheless, there is...

20:30.563 --> 20:34.067
a lot of baggage here.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.193
And we'd like to make

20:34.067 --> 20:35.193
a fresh start.

20:35.193 --> 20:36.610
You know,

20:35.193 --> 20:36.610
you need permission

20:36.610 --> 20:38.696
from me and Luisa to sell.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.696
Yes. I know.

20:38.696 --> 20:39.906
And if you don't give it

20:38.696 --> 20:39.906
to me...

20:39.906 --> 20:41.115
NARRATOR:

20:39.906 --> 20:41.115
<i>She'll blackmail you</i>

20:41.115 --> 20:42.909
<i>with all of Scott's dirt!</i>

20:42.909 --> 20:45.411
First, let me see if I can put

20:42.909 --> 20:45.411
money together to buy you out.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.706
Oh.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.208
Yeah, that-that would work.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.752
RAFAEL:

20:50.208 --> 20:52.752
<i>And then she told me</i>

20:50.208 --> 20:52.752
<i>I had 48 hours,</i>

20:52.752 --> 20:54.503
which is crazy.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.131
I think there's

20:55.880 --> 20:57.131
something going on.

20:57.131 --> 20:59.008
NARRATOR:

20:57.131 --> 20:59.008
<i>Yes! Finally!</i>

20:59.008 --> 21:01.301
Like what?

20:59.008 --> 21:01.301
RAFAEL: She's not herself.

21:01.301 --> 21:02.553
NARRATOR:

21:01.301 --> 21:02.553
<i>Warmer.</i>

21:02.553 --> 21:03.679
I think Scott's

21:02.553 --> 21:03.679
blackmailing her.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.264
NARRATOR:

21:03.679 --> 21:05.264
<i>Are you serious?</i>

21:05.264 --> 21:06.933
Are you serious?

21:05.264 --> 21:06.933
Well, it happened with Milos.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.434
NARRATOR:

21:06.933 --> 21:08.434
<i>Colder! Colder!</i>

21:08.434 --> 21:10.644
I mean, I'm having dinner

21:08.434 --> 21:10.644
with them tonight.

21:10.644 --> 21:11.979
I'll suss out the vibe.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.272
NARRATOR:

21:11.979 --> 21:13.272
<i>Yeah, whatever.</i>

21:13.272 --> 21:14.857
<i>I'm not gonna</i>

21:13.272 --> 21:14.857
<i>get my hopes up.</i>

21:14.857 --> 21:16.817
Oh, before I go...

21:21.321 --> 21:22.782
From my dad.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.076
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

JANE:

21:27.286 --> 21:29.247
<i>It was so awkward.</i>

21:29.247 --> 21:31.331
But I couldn't say no

21:29.247 --> 21:31.331
to my dad.

21:31.331 --> 21:34.334
Oh, yeah, I hear you.

21:31.331 --> 21:34.334
Cost of doing business.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.045
I had to meet him for

21:34.334 --> 21:36.045
a guilt mani-pedi today.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.755
I'm sorry,

21:36.045 --> 21:37.755
I can't watch this.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.216
( laughs ):

21:37.755 --> 21:40.216
Show off.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.223
Michael!

21:47.223 --> 21:49.142
We agreed, no more

21:47.223 --> 21:49.142
venti lattes.

21:49.142 --> 21:52.019
Okay, I was in a hurry.

21:49.142 --> 21:52.019
The drive-thru was right there.

21:52.019 --> 21:54.814
The budget only works

21:52.019 --> 21:54.814
if we both stick to it.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.191
Oh, yeah? That doesn't look

21:54.814 --> 21:57.191
like two-buck Chuck.

21:57.191 --> 21:58.859
That's different,

21:57.191 --> 21:58.859
it's for Petra,

21:58.859 --> 22:00.903
who did a really nice

21:58.859 --> 22:00.903
thing for us.

22:00.903 --> 22:02.738
Besides, it comes out of

22:00.903 --> 22:02.738
the entertainment budget.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.991
We'll just...not see

22:02.738 --> 22:04.991
a movie this month.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.742
Fine. Then I'd like

22:04.991 --> 22:06.742
my non-movie

22:06.742 --> 22:07.868
to count towards

22:06.742 --> 22:07.868
my coffee.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.078
You can't do that.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.370
Your latte is not

22:09.078 --> 22:10.370
entertainment.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.705
That's not true.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.705
I had a good time...

22:11.705 --> 22:14.208
( doorbell rings )

22:11.705 --> 22:14.208
...okay?

22:14.208 --> 22:16.335
Better than I'm gonna have

22:14.208 --> 22:16.335
at this weird dinner party.

<i>to the:</i>

22:21.381 --> 22:23.301
Is that dressing

22:21.381 --> 22:23.301
gluten-free?

22:23.301 --> 22:24.760
I'll check.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.429
Thanks.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.015
Oh, no red for me.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.933
I get heartburn.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.933
Do you have any white?

22:32.893 --> 22:34.478
Yeah.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.232
Babe, be reasonable.

22:38.232 --> 22:39.650
Now is not

22:38.232 --> 22:39.650
a good time to sell.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.694
I just want out.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.694
Flamingo Friday's booked solid.

22:41.694 --> 22:42.945
We're turning

22:41.694 --> 22:42.945
the hotel around.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.780
The staff is planning

22:42.945 --> 22:44.780
a walkout.

22:46.699 --> 22:50.328
No gluten. Yay!

23:01.547 --> 23:03.590
Welcome home, Xiomara!

23:03.590 --> 23:05.467
I prepared dinner...

23:05.467 --> 23:08.137
to celebrate

23:05.467 --> 23:08.137
your first day.

23:08.137 --> 23:11.307
I'm so proud of you!

23:12.599 --> 23:13.976
How was it?

23:13.976 --> 23:17.271
It was so great.

23:17.271 --> 23:18.939
It's just the door

23:17.271 --> 23:18.939
on your left.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.066
Let's make a deal.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.650
Before you go

23:20.066 --> 23:21.650
to the bathroom?

23:21.650 --> 23:23.443
Petra told me about

23:21.650 --> 23:23.443
your financial predicament.

23:23.443 --> 23:25.988
That extra grand a month

23:23.443 --> 23:25.988
you need?

23:25.988 --> 23:29.283
What if the hotel

23:25.988 --> 23:29.283
covered the discrepancy?

23:29.283 --> 23:30.910
We'll make it

23:29.283 --> 23:30.910
an official position--

23:30.910 --> 23:33.329
Social Ambassador--

23:30.910 --> 23:33.329
and all you have to do

23:33.329 --> 23:35.206
is get the rest of the staff

a trigger for me.

30:14.104 --> 30:16.482
I-- I had my first drink

30:14.104 --> 30:16.482
with a babysitter.

30:16.482 --> 30:20.319
I know a lot about

30:16.482 --> 30:20.319
Really?

30:20.319 --> 30:22.279
Are you in AA?

30:20.319 --> 30:22.279
No.

30:22.279 --> 30:24.823
I am in S.A.G.

Otherwise known as

30:24.823 --> 30:28.118

30:28.118 --> 30:30.537

30:50.098 --> 30:54.311
So why did you lie?

30:54.311 --> 30:57.063
You were so proud of me

30:54.311 --> 30:57.063
and so into the idea

30:57.063 --> 30:58.315
of me as a banker.

30:58.315 --> 31:00.609
I was just trying

30:58.315 --> 31:00.609
to be supportive.

31:00.609 --> 31:01.777
( sighs )

31:01.777 --> 31:03.111
Like Jane.

31:03.111 --> 31:06.031
Jane thought the bank

31:03.111 --> 31:06.031
was a horrible idea.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.867
Really?

31:12.538 --> 31:15.457
Why didn't you just

31:12.538 --> 31:15.457
tell me how you feel?

31:15.457 --> 31:16.625

I know I need

31:40.982 --> 31:43.360
your opinions,

31:43.360 --> 31:46.946

I don't want you to end up

No.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.350
it was Pilar that hit

32:57.350 --> 32:59.478

want to drink more.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.146
Okay, I get it.

33:01.146 --> 33:03.273
Well, in that case,

33:01.146 --> 33:03.273
we have to get

33:03.273 --> 33:05.943
to the root

33:03.273 --> 33:05.943
of those feelings.

33:05.943 --> 33:08.236
Did you study psychology?

33:08.236 --> 33:10.238
You could say that.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.073
What school of thought?

33:12.073 --> 33:13.199
Meisner.

33:13.199 --> 33:16.077

33:18.204 --> 33:19.581
I've never heard of him.

33:19.581 --> 33:20.666

In the heart

as Sandra Bullock, Tom Cruise,

33:22.501 --> 33:25.253
and James Franco.

33:25.253 --> 33:27.422
All of whom have

33:25.253 --> 33:27.422
used his techniques

33:27.422 --> 33:30.133
to get underneath

33:27.422 --> 33:30.133
emotions.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.928
I'll say a phrase,

33:31.343 --> 33:32.928
let's say,

33:32.928 --> 33:34.220
"You're an alcoholic,"

33:34.220 --> 33:36.807
and then you'll

33:34.220 --> 33:36.807
repeat it, but with "I".

33:36.807 --> 33:38.224
"I'm an alcoholic."

Oh, no.

33:51.237 --> 33:52.656
Oh, it's only 9:00.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.535
Yeah.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.535
Why are you playing so

33:57.870 --> 33:59.329
I'm not.

33:59.329 --> 34:00.706
Though, that's exactly

what you'd say if you were.

so that I don't feel this.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.723
Why are you terrible?

34:17.723 --> 34:20.266
Because all I do

34:17.723 --> 34:20.266
is cause Rafael pain.

34:20.266 --> 34:23.186
( whispering ):

34:20.266 --> 34:23.186
And I think my ex-lover

killed his mother.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.778
so bad, you know?

34:31.778 --> 34:34.072
My brother

34:31.778 --> 34:34.072
doesn't deserve this.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.742
No matter how many times

34:34.072 --> 34:36.742
I've failed him,

he's always been there

34:36.742 --> 34:38.618
for me.

34:38.618 --> 34:41.246
And then now

34:38.618 --> 34:41.246
that he has no family,

34:41.246 --> 34:43.665
I still can't pull it together

34:41.246 --> 34:43.665
and be there for him.

34:43.665 --> 34:46.292
Rafael<i> does</i> have

34:47.544 --> 34:49.963
As for you...

34:49.963 --> 34:53.216
Ricardo said it best

34:49.963 --> 34:53.216

realize that earlier.

35:26.499 --> 35:27.709
It's okay.

35:27.709 --> 35:30.837
But I do think

35:27.709 --> 35:30.837
I should tell you...

I don't think

you're gonna get that part.

37:32.209 --> 37:35.795
I mean, you have a rich dad,

37:32.209 --> 37:35.795
and a rich baby daddy

37:35.795 --> 37:38.297
to fall back on,

37:35.795 --> 37:38.297
and I-I don't have that.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.759
Yeah.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.301
That's true.

37:42.301 --> 37:44.930
Michael reminded me

37:42.301 --> 37:44.930
of that.

37:44.930 --> 37:48.391
I guess it's just

37:44.930 --> 37:48.391
all so new, I-I forget.

37:48.391 --> 37:51.269
I think we should move

37:48.391 --> 37:51.269
into a smaller place.

37:52.687 --> 37:55.314
I grew up stressed

37:52.687 --> 37:55.314
about money.

37:55.314 --> 37:59.527
And living above our means

37:55.314 --> 37:59.527
is stressing us out now.

37:59.527 --> 38:00.946
And I don't want that...

38:00.946 --> 38:02.655
for us or Mateo.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.783
I was thinking

38:02.655 --> 38:04.783
the same thing.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.910
Not about childhood,

38:04.783 --> 38:06.910
but about Spotify

38:06.910 --> 38:08.245
and lattes, and...

38:06.910 --> 38:08.245
( chuckles )

38:08.245 --> 38:09.537
I just want us to

38:08.245 --> 38:09.537
be able to have fun.

38:09.537 --> 38:10.872
Exactly, me too.

38:10.872 --> 38:12.415
We'll move into

38:10.872 --> 38:12.415
a one bedroom.

38:12.415 --> 38:13.666
We only have Mateo

38:12.415 --> 38:13.666
half the time.

38:13.666 --> 38:15.460
Perfect.

38:13.666 --> 38:15.460
We'll just move back

38:15.460 --> 38:17.129
to a bigger place

38:15.460 --> 38:17.129
when we can afford it.

38:25.011 --> 38:27.555
So...this isn't

38:25.011 --> 38:27.555
a housewarming anymore.

38:27.555 --> 38:28.556
It's a good-bye party.

Ah.

38:37.149 --> 38:40.359
( in Spanish ):

38:37.149 --> 38:40.359
For the next new place.

38:40.359 --> 38:41.987
I bought them

38:40.359 --> 38:41.987
with my employee discount.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.404
Huh?

38:41.987 --> 38:43.404
What?

38:43.404 --> 38:46.783
You are looking at

38:43.404 --> 38:46.783

the Seashells

38:48.493 --> 38:50.954
No way.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.954
That's perfect for you.

38:50.954 --> 38:54.166
Oh, Ma. You really do

38:50.954 --> 38:54.166
love that little store.

38:54.166 --> 38:56.168
Mm-hmm.

38:57.294 --> 39:00.379
So...I didn't get the part.

39:00.379 --> 39:02.966
That's the way

39:00.379 --> 39:02.966
the cookie crumbled.

39:02.966 --> 39:04.134
I'm sorry, Rogelio.

39:04.134 --> 39:05.969
I know you

39:04.134 --> 39:05.969
really wanted it.

39:05.969 --> 39:09.264
So, uh, so, what's next

39:05.969 --> 39:09.264
on the 87-point plan for, uh...

39:09.264 --> 39:10.556
American superstardom?

39:10.556 --> 39:11.683
I'm glad you asked.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.143
My new friend, Rafael,

39:13.143 --> 39:14.435
got me a meeting with

39:13.143 --> 39:14.435
his friend,

39:14.435 --> 39:15.895
an independent film

39:14.435 --> 39:15.895
producer.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.939
Oh.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.939
Come on, Michael.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.939
Don't be jealous.

39:17.939 --> 39:19.691
I can be friends

39:17.939 --> 39:19.691
with both of you.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.860
Oh, I'm... I'm not jealous.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.860
Rafael and I, we're cool.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.569
Sorry, excuse me.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.569
Come on.

39:23.569 --> 39:24.737
Don't shut me out.

39:24.737 --> 39:26.656
Hey, hey, looking good,

39:24.737 --> 39:26.656
my friend.

39:26.656 --> 39:28.366
Ah, we miss you down

39:26.656 --> 39:28.366
at the station.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.368
( sighs ):

39:28.366 --> 39:30.368
Eager to get back.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.786
Two weeks

39:30.368 --> 39:31.786
until my physical.

39:31.786 --> 39:34.914
So... Rafael told me

39:31.786 --> 39:34.914
Luisa left for rehab.

39:34.914 --> 39:35.957
Yeah, this morning.

39:35.957 --> 39:37.167
We've got eyes on her.

39:37.167 --> 39:38.543
If she contacts Rose,

39:37.167 --> 39:38.543
we'll know.

39:38.543 --> 39:41.087
Good. Anything new

Look, realistically,

39:56.644 --> 39:59.438
I need more time.

39:59.438 --> 40:00.815
Well, you don't have

39:59.438 --> 40:00.815
more time.

40:00.815 --> 40:03.193
I'll find another buyer,

40:00.815 --> 40:03.193
Milos perhaps.

40:03.193 --> 40:05.987
You can't sell your shares

40:03.193 --> 40:05.987
without my permission.

40:05.987 --> 40:07.446
Then give me permission.

40:07.446 --> 40:10.825
And...your shares too,

40:07.446 --> 40:10.825

40:10.825 --> 40:11.868
What?

40:11.868 --> 40:13.494
Or I'll send you to jail.

40:13.494 --> 40:14.787
What are you talking about?

40:14.787 --> 40:17.415
You had a deal with

40:14.787 --> 40:17.415
the police.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.376
You confessed

40:17.415 --> 40:19.376
to insider trading.

40:19.376 --> 40:21.378
They dropped the charges

40:19.376 --> 40:21.378
with the assumption

40:21.378 --> 40:23.796
that you had no other

40:21.378 --> 40:23.796
illegal dealings, right?

40:23.796 --> 40:25.924
However,

40:25.924 --> 40:27.717
when your father died,

40:27.717 --> 40:30.720
his finances were a mess,

40:27.717 --> 40:30.720
weren't they?

40:30.720 --> 40:33.390
An illegal mess,

40:30.720 --> 40:33.390
in fact.

40:33.390 --> 40:35.683
