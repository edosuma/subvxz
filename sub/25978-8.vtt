03:51.166 --> 03:52.000
My love...

07:56.000 --> 07:57.541
I can't do it anymore.

07:57.625 --> 07:59.583
I feel sick, I'm scared.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Mom...

18:56.958 --> 18:57.958
Cheers.

18:59.291 --> 19:00.625
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

22:01.541 --> 22:02.916
No, don't touch me!

22:58.125 --> 22:59.750
I'm so excited.

23:51.875 --> 23:53.500
Shit! Shit! Shit!

24:15.625 --> 24:17.791
I need a man like you.

24:18.375 --> 24:19.500
A good man.

24:20.500 --> 24:23.083
A partner who can keep a secret.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.666
Runa Gundersen, fifty-six.

25:27.750 --> 25:30.208
Born in Levanger. Steps to green door.

25:32.208 --> 25:33.375
White-haired baby...

25:34.208 --> 25:35.208
My love...

25:35.291 --> 25:37.041
Double-jointed...

25:37.833 --> 25:41.041
Social worker.

25:59.958 --> 26:00.791
No...

26:51.666 --> 26:53.208
You said we were a family.

26:53.291 --> 26:55.250
You promised to help and protect us.

34:38.416 --> 34:39.666
He doesn't love you.

34:40.416 --> 34:41.750
He needs you.

34:41.833 --> 34:45.333
He's always needed you.
Because he knows he's nothing without you.

34:48.208 --> 34:49.083
Yes...

34:49.708 --> 34:52.541
And maybe I'm nothing without him.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.000
Don't say that.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.500
My love...

35:01.250 --> 35:02.541
Don't listen to him.

35:03.125 --> 35:05.666
Sigrid... Sigrid was right.

35:06.375 --> 35:07.833
He's a monster.

35:09.041 --> 35:10.000
You know he is.

39:10.166 --> 39:13.666
We could still make this a real home.

39:13.750 --> 39:17.375
For us two. Like we always...

39:17.458 --> 39:18.291
Stop!

39:18.916 --> 39:21.291
Stop... Stop.

39:23.000 --> 39:23.958
Please.

39:24.750 --> 39:27.125
Look at me, answer me.

39:31.791 --> 39:33.125
I'm not Freya.

39:34.416 --> 39:35.333
Not anymore.

55:19.750 --> 55:21.750
