04:56.640 --> 04:58.040
When I was a boy,

04:58.520 --> 04:59.880
queuing up for confession,

05:01.360 --> 05:03.760
I'd examine my conscience so fiercely,

05:03.840 --> 05:06.640
I think the boys behind could read
the sins on the back of my head.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.080
[ALL LAUGHS]

05:09.920 --> 05:11.760
I sometimes think today,

05:12.840 --> 05:14.200
it's cowardice with me.

05:15.960 --> 05:18.200
Things I should have said
and haven't said,

05:18.280 --> 05:20.440
things I should have done
and haven't done.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.160
All through cowardice.

05:24.720 --> 05:29.440
There's a woman here, who gave birth
to a boy 18 years ago

05:29.520 --> 05:31.560
and she loved and nurtured him and

05:31.640 --> 05:33.800
saw him shot dead in his own street.

05:34.040 --> 05:39.000
She later met two people who she
could have blamed for his death.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.840
But she did not.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.600
She embraced them

05:43.680 --> 05:45.760
and absolved them of all blame.

05:45.920 --> 05:49.400
And in doing so proved herself
a far better Catholic,

05:49.520 --> 05:51.560
a far better Christian
than I can ever be.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.760
Why then am I her priest?

05:56.160 --> 05:57.240
Why is she not mine?

05:59.120 --> 06:00.720
I think I know why.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.400
I think I understand why our

06:03.480 --> 06:07.120
church is so set against women priests.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.240
I think it's the old men
who run the church

06:10.320 --> 06:12.520
who don't want to see
menstrual blood on the altar.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.360
I think it's as basic as that.

06:15.520 --> 06:16.760
Fear of,

06:17.360 --> 06:19.360
ignorance of, contempt

06:19.920 --> 06:21.280
for the bodies of women.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.120
"Ah, it's all right," you might say,
"these old men

06:25.200 --> 06:26.440
"will soon be dead."

06:26.640 --> 06:28.200
But they've taught younger men,

06:28.280 --> 06:32.120
and those younger men
will, in turn, teach younger men.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.760
And so it will continue, this fear of,

06:37.640 --> 06:39.160
for the bodies of women.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.360

08:29.080 --> 08:31.640
Uh, I was following up a burglary, sir,

08:31.920 --> 08:33.680
at 168 Ferndale,

08:33.800 --> 08:35.840
when it came through
about 17 Madison, Sir.

08:35.920 --> 08:36.960
And what happened then?

08:37.560 --> 08:42.880
Vernon, um, Mr Oyenusi,
he was in a distressed state,

08:43.000 --> 08:44.880
holding a knife saying

08:44.960 --> 08:47.320
-they were gonna do him harm.
-They being...

08:47.840 --> 08:49.480
That was my impression, sir, yeah.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.880
I was outside the home at the time,

08:52.200 --> 08:53.600
the door was open, the chain was on.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.240
I was talking to him,
I tried to calm him down

08:55.320 --> 08:58.280
-and...
-And then, and then, we arrived, sir.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.840
Myself, Police Constable Dawn Morris

09:00.920 --> 09:03.000
and Police Constable Ian Wakefield.

09:03.080 --> 09:06.320
-And then?
-And then, Mr Oyenusi became

09:06.400 --> 09:10.160
more distressed, he...
Got the knife, uh...

09:10.240 --> 09:13.120

in a threatening manner.

Police Principal Wakefield

09:16.280 --> 09:17.920
and the man's mother,

McDONALD: The mother, Helen Oyenusi.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.000
So you feared for her safety, as well as
your own and your fellow officer?

09:26.080 --> 09:27.200
Absolutely, sir.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.240
Called Collins.

he's from the IPCC.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.360
Calls it police contact.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.760
Not a shooting, he calls it
a police contact, so...

09:47.880 --> 09:49.040
-Hmm.
-You know.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.280
I know his game.

in any incident resulting in serious or

09:57.200 --> 09:59.480
fatal injuries following police contact.

And believe me,

it's for your own good
as much as everyone else's.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.800

10:09.720 --> 10:12.920
is that each of you provide
Chief Inspector McDonald

10:13.320 --> 10:15.840
with an initial account
of what took place,

10:15.920 --> 10:17.880

and rest...

10:17.960 --> 10:20.480
Uh, we've all been affected
by the CS, sir.

10:20.560 --> 10:23.800
So, I request a few days rest
before we give our initial accounts.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.160

he was only a danger to himself.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.360

Even less need to shoot him,
is that right?

"Anybody want to carry a gun?"

10:53.880 --> 10:55.720
bar them forever from carrying one.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.040
You give guns to people who don't want
to use them, don't want 'em near 'em.

11:01.640 --> 11:04.200
You give a gun to someone like Kilcaid
and he'll use it.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.520
Give a spray to someone like Dawn,

11:09.040 --> 11:10.320
she'll use it, sooner or later.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.560
You know, Dawn sprayed him, 'cause
she's always wanting to spray someone.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.760
Kilcaid shot him 'cause
he always wanted to shoot someone.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.480

a friend of mine,

11:31.360 --> 11:33.760

"that shut and you can't go far wrong."

my own advice and talk, okay?

11:42.920 --> 11:45.440
-Right, okay.
-You have got to tell the truth.

11:46.360 --> 11:49.720
It's absolutely essential
you stick to the truth.

with that knife?

His mother is heartbroken as it is,
that'll kill her.

55:31.240 --> 55:32.840
I'd love you to mean that.

55:33.880 --> 55:35.640
I'd love...

55:35.720 --> 55:38.680
To be able to forgive you, you see,
and dump all this...

55:41.440 --> 55:42.880
Do you mean it?

55:45.320 --> 55:46.720
No.

55:46.800 --> 55:49.440
The body is insignificant, Michael.

55:49.520 --> 55:52.200
Whatever it does is insignificant.

55:52.280 --> 55:54.760
It's the soul within that counts.

55:54.840 --> 55:56.000
Bye, Michael.

55:57.640 --> 55:59.280
I'm gonna pray for you.

55:59.720 --> 56:00.880
I'll phone the police.

56:03.040 --> 56:05.360
No, I'm gonna pray,

56:05.440 --> 56:08.040
that you realise the enormity
of what you've done.

56:08.120 --> 56:09.320
I'm gonna pray

56:09.400 --> 56:10.640
that you realise

56:10.720 --> 56:12.360
the enormity of what you did,

56:12.440 --> 56:14.000
and the lives you damaged.

56:14.080 --> 56:16.640
I'm gonna pray that you suffer from it,

56:16.720 --> 56:19.440
and through suffering you atone for it.

56:19.520 --> 56:22.800
And I'll pray by doing so... [PANTS]

56:22.880 --> 56:25.640
You'll suffer long enough
and hard enough

56:25.720 --> 56:28.760
for God to show you mercy,
you old bastard.
