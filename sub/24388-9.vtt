Hey! Get back here!

11:08.084 --> 11:09.752
[all yelling]

11:09.835 --> 11:10.920
Come on!

11:12.338 --> 11:14.215
-[Tim whimpers]
-Hold them off, Templeton!

11:14.298 --> 11:16.217
[grunts]

11:16.300 --> 11:18.177
I'm not... [grunts]

11:18.260 --> 11:21.097
-...comfortable shoving babies!
-[babies yelling]

11:21.764 --> 11:24.433
This was your idea.
Wanna win, you gotta shove--

11:24.517 --> 11:27.019
-Water balloons!
-Huh? [yells]

11:28.854 --> 11:31.899
Oh, great.
Accounting had a birthday this week.

11:31.982 --> 11:34.402
-Don't worry, I've got this! Ugh!
-Templeton!

11:34.485 --> 11:36.153
Keep going! I'll catch up.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.238
Go!

11:37.321 --> 11:40.282
Ah! I can't shove that many babies!
Agh! [grunts]

11:41.409 --> 11:44.245
The cavalry has arrived!

11:45.704 --> 11:47.039
Hose 'em down.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.168
[yelping]

11:52.711 --> 11:53.671
[chuckles]

11:53.754 --> 11:56.799
Staci, when this is all over,
remind me to promote you to something.

11:56.882 --> 11:57.925
Yay!

11:58.008 --> 12:01.679
-[gasps] Other triplets!
-Oh, soil my diaper.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.806
Down with the traitor!

12:03.889 --> 12:06.892
And all who ally with his traitorousness!

12:06.976 --> 12:08.477
Brothers, no!

12:08.561 --> 12:10.604
[screaming]

12:10.980 --> 12:13.315
-Minefield!
-Hit the brakes!

12:13.399 --> 12:15.151
Brakes!

12:15.234 --> 12:16.694
[Jimbo wincing] Ouch!

12:16.777 --> 12:18.487
-[yelling]
-Boss!

12:18.863 --> 12:21.031
-[Boss Baby] Oh!
-[both grunt]

12:21.115 --> 12:21.991
[groans]

12:22.074 --> 12:23.993
[grunts] You okay?

12:24.076 --> 12:26.871
[groans] My owies have boo-boos.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.250
-Brothers together.
-To the death.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.752
Wait. When did that become
a possibility?

12:33.836 --> 12:34.670
[puffs]

12:34.753 --> 12:36.672
-[both coughing]
-[Amal] Baby powder smoke bomb!

12:36.755 --> 12:37.840
[metal clanging]

12:37.923 --> 12:39.508
[triplet 2] I'm blind...

12:39.592 --> 12:42.178
But my rash feels great!

12:42.761 --> 12:44.096
Where'd they go?

12:45.347 --> 12:48.058
[Tim] What happened? Did we die?
Is this baby heaven?

12:48.142 --> 12:50.186
Baby heaven's dark and spooky.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.731
-[gasps] Tell me we're not in baby he--
-It's an air vent.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.316
We're very much alive. Relax.

12:55.399 --> 12:56.484
-[both gasp]
-Panic!

12:56.567 --> 12:59.403
Hi-i-i!

12:59.487 --> 13:01.572
-Frankie?
-What are you doing down here?

13:01.655 --> 13:04.074
-I gave you a job topside.
-Oh, you did.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.994
But when I saw you were being chased
by that frightful mob,

13:07.077 --> 13:09.121
I used my old vents to save you.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.332
After all, you saved me from a mob once.

13:11.415 --> 13:13.584
We should hang out sometime
without mobs.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.337
-What time is it?
-Think we're missing hot dogs?

13:16.420 --> 13:20.925
-We might even miss Dad's show.
-No way. We'll get there.

13:21.008 --> 13:25.012
But if we leave, Mega Fat CEO Baby
gets everything he wanted.

13:25.095 --> 13:27.014
All of this would be for nothing.

13:27.097 --> 13:31.227
I told you, you can't fight every battle.
Sometimes the cheating bullies win.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.480
-You accept it and move on.
-I don't accept that.

13:34.563 --> 13:37.149
Cheaters and bullies do not win.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.110
Remember what Dad said
about rock 'n' roll and not giving up?

13:40.194 --> 13:42.488
Technically, the bass guitar
instructional video said that.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.615
Did he get blisters? Yes.

13:44.698 --> 13:48.369
Are his fingers infected
and super gross? They are.

13:48.452 --> 13:52.248
But did he give up learning his song?
Never!

13:52.831 --> 13:55.584
I just wanna say I have no idea
what's going on,

13:55.668 --> 13:59.129
but it's been great
to be part of this moment.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.424
[crowd cheering]
Go, Ted! Go, Ted! Go, Ted!

14:02.508 --> 14:04.510
Go, Ted! Go, Ted! Go, Ted!

14:04.593 --> 14:06.428
Whoo! That's my man!

14:06.512 --> 14:08.222
-[man 1] Way to go, Ted!
-[man 2] Yeah!

14:08.305 --> 14:10.432
-Yeah!
-We love you, man!

14:11.976 --> 14:14.562
Uh, I'm gonna need five more minutes.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.605
-[man 3] Oh, man!
-[crowd groans]

14:19.191 --> 14:22.486
What do you mean, disappeared?
Whose fault is this?

14:22.570 --> 14:26.198
Come, come. Show of hands
so I can smack them, you naughty babies.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.702
Where is my fancy prize walker?!

14:29.785 --> 14:32.413
Guys, I need it for winning!

14:32.496 --> 14:34.039
-[beeping]
-Wha...?

14:35.541 --> 14:39.128
Vroom-vroom, Mega Fat CEO Baby.

14:39.211 --> 14:43.424
Block the napping cubicle finish line!
If Boss Baby tries to cross it...

14:43.841 --> 14:48.137
you make him pay with ouchies.

14:48.804 --> 14:53.309
No! I can't do it. Boss Baby's my friend.

14:53.392 --> 14:57.062
How touching.
And now, I'm touching this button

14:57.146 --> 14:59.899
that spills your darkest secrets.
Shabowza!

15:01.191 --> 15:05.779
This will be my seventh attempt.
The world must know what it's like.

15:05.863 --> 15:06.947
Oh, no!

15:08.032 --> 15:10.451
-[crowd gasping]
-[gasps]

15:11.869 --> 15:13.203
-[worker] Ew!
-[crowd gasping]

15:14.788 --> 15:16.040
He's gonna eat it.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.583
[workers gasping, shouting]

15:17.666 --> 15:19.710
-[worker baby] Ew!
-Oh! There it goes.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.754
It was delicious!

15:22.254 --> 15:23.130
[groans]

15:23.213 --> 15:27.801
Anyone else want their secrets spilled?
Amal's diaper love poems, perhaps?

15:28.594 --> 15:34.183
Ahem. "You wrap me up like a blanket.
But, like, with more stank-et."

15:34.266 --> 15:36.602
Stop! I'll do anything!

15:36.685 --> 15:38.479
-Yeah, me too!
-Me too.

15:38.562 --> 15:39.396
Me too.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.983
And I'll take back
that prize walker myself.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.779
[man 1] Ted, you're my idol!

15:46.862 --> 15:49.114
-[man 2] Go, Ted!
-[man 3] Ted rules!

15:49.198 --> 15:52.034
This is for my boys... wherever they are.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.869
[thumps]

15:56.205 --> 15:57.373
[bass music continues]

16:05.172 --> 16:06.173
[spits]

16:10.135 --> 16:14.807
Why are we all standing dramatically?
Somebody give me pushes!

16:14.890 --> 16:17.726
-All aboard!
-Let's ride.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.528
Almost got him. Faster!

16:27.611 --> 16:31.323
Sir, we'd go faster
if you'd use your feet.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.200
You're doing fine. Now board them!

16:36.203 --> 16:37.037
[grunts]

16:38.080 --> 16:39.665
[groaning]

16:43.836 --> 16:45.087
[CEO Baby] Cut them off!

16:45.170 --> 16:47.631
-Get the walker!
-They're pulling ahead!

16:48.966 --> 16:53.303
Steer for me. This machine
needs $700 Italian loafer power.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.888
[Boss Baby panting]

16:54.972 --> 16:56.432
Jimbo, help him!

16:57.099 --> 16:58.934
Activate turbo feet!

16:59.018 --> 17:02.062
Run, run, run, run, run,
run, run, run!

17:04.565 --> 17:05.733
[wheels screeching]

17:06.984 --> 17:09.778
Triplets, stop your disloyal brother!

17:12.322 --> 17:14.033
I'll handle them.

17:14.658 --> 17:17.870
-Wait. No!
-Let him go. It's a family matter.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.540
-We don't have to fight.
-You called us a bad name!

17:21.623 --> 17:25.085
-Yeah, you ding-dong!
-Now you called me a bad name!

17:25.169 --> 17:26.336
What a chowderhead.

17:26.420 --> 17:29.882
-Hey!
-Oh, great. Now we're all angry!

17:29.965 --> 17:31.717
-We should wrestle!
-Yeah!

17:32.301 --> 17:33.677
[Triplet 1] I love you guys.

17:33.761 --> 17:34.928
[all giggling]

17:35.012 --> 17:36.388
[groaning]

17:36.638 --> 17:38.682
[CEO Baby]
Brotherly love disgusts me. Bye!

17:42.061 --> 17:43.437
[grunting]

17:47.316 --> 17:48.317
[CEO Baby yelps]

17:51.737 --> 17:52.571
[grunts]

17:53.322 --> 17:55.365
Ah, simple little man-baby.

17:55.449 --> 17:58.035
How does it feel
knowing you're slowing Boss Baby down?

17:58.118 --> 18:02.122
You'll never fit in. Your shirt's boring.
I don't like your laugh.

18:02.206 --> 18:06.877
-Is this making you want to quit?
-No, because cheating bullies never win.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.420
-[grunts]
-[shouts]

18:08.504 --> 18:12.132
Jimbo, don't you want more
than a job pushing some baby walker?

18:12.216 --> 18:13.967
-No.
-Join me, Jimbo.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.303
-I don't wanna!
-[doll squeaks]

18:16.386 --> 18:21.225
-Can I tempt you with a soft bear toy?
-A little, but not enough!

18:21.308 --> 18:23.727
Give it up, Mega Fat. Jimbo's loyal.

18:23.811 --> 18:27.856
Ah, but are you loyal?
I know how ambitious you are.

18:27.940 --> 18:31.652
You could be more
than field team scary tough girl.

18:31.735 --> 18:35.322
Boss Baby isn't your superior.
He's just another obstacle.

18:35.405 --> 18:39.243
Join me, Staci.
The apprentice always overthrows the boss.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.620
-It's your corporate destiny.
-[gasps]

18:41.703 --> 18:43.330
Staci...?

18:45.999 --> 18:47.334
[Boss Baby] Hang on!

18:47.417 --> 18:48.544
[CEO Baby shouting]

18:48.627 --> 18:50.212
[screaming]

18:50.629 --> 18:52.089
[howling]

18:52.840 --> 18:53.841
[CEO Baby] Ugh!

18:53.924 --> 18:55.384
[all groaning]

18:55.467 --> 18:58.720
-I am not betraying my team!
-Glad to hear it.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.974
Not until I'm good and ready. [giggles]

19:02.057 --> 19:05.519
Uh, maybe I should drive now.
Napping cubicle.

19:05.602 --> 19:06.770
[workers growl]

19:06.854 --> 19:08.730
Let's put this game to bed.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.651
End of the road, Boss Baby!

19:12.734 --> 19:16.530
Ha-ha. Care to surrender now
and save yourself a lot of pain?

19:16.613 --> 19:20.242
-Please say no.
-We're never gonna get through them.

19:20.325 --> 19:23.078
Stay here. Tim and I have to finish this.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.914
Nothing personal.
Mostly a weight thing. You'll see.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.208
-Ready, Templeton?
-Let's ride.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.752
-Go, boys!
-I believe!

19:31.712 --> 19:33.547
[worker] You can do it, Boss Baby!

19:33.630 --> 19:35.549
I believe in you!

19:35.632 --> 19:36.633
[worker 2] Go!

19:37.259 --> 19:38.969
[strumming]

19:39.052 --> 19:40.721
[worker] Do it for all of us!

19:40.804 --> 19:41.722
[strumming]

19:41.805 --> 19:43.432
[cheering]

19:44.725 --> 19:46.810
-Take aim!
-[all snarling] Yeah!

19:49.146 --> 19:51.815
Happy Spirit Day, Boss Baby.

19:52.649 --> 19:53.692
Fire!

19:53.775 --> 19:54.693
Now, Frankie!

19:55.527 --> 19:57.779
-Hang on!
-[Tim] Whoa!

19:57.863 --> 19:59.698
We did it. We're flying!

19:59.781 --> 20:03.785
[Baby Boss]
Napping cubicle, here we come!

20:03.869 --> 20:06.079
-Oh, right. Gravity.
-[both screaming]

20:06.163 --> 20:08.207
[all gasping]

20:08.290 --> 20:09.541
Hah!

20:11.585 --> 20:12.836
Winner!

20:12.920 --> 20:14.922
[cheering]

20:21.345 --> 20:23.931
[man 1] Yeah!

20:24.014 --> 20:25.515
[crowd cheering]

20:27.893 --> 20:29.478
Yah-hoo-hoo!

20:30.812 --> 20:32.981
[workers cheering] Yeah! Yeah!

20:33.565 --> 20:34.566
The...

20:34.858 --> 20:36.652
[groaning]

20:36.735 --> 20:40.030
...prized baby walker is yours. [groans]

20:40.113 --> 20:41.615
[workers cheering, shouting]

20:41.782 --> 20:44.868
Thank you, sir.
You played a good game yourself.

20:44.952 --> 20:45.953
But cheated.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.287
[Jimbo beatboxing]

20:49.873 --> 20:51.583
[laughing] Yeah!

20:51.667 --> 20:53.001
Way to go, boss!

20:54.169 --> 20:56.255
Yeah!

20:56.338 --> 20:57.589
Wow, I, um...

20:58.674 --> 21:01.260
Oh, I don't know what to, uh...

21:06.682 --> 21:07.516
[faint crash]

21:07.599 --> 21:09.184
[stammers]

21:09.268 --> 21:10.269
No!

21:10.727 --> 21:15.107
You're the only one who wanted the walker.
That's my prize.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.109
[cheering]

21:17.192 --> 21:19.569
And the look on your face? His prize.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.788
Timothy Templeton.

21:29.871 --> 21:34.376
-Oh, my gosh, Dad. We missed it?
-Your father was counting on you.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.462
For the record,
it was a heck of a show.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.841
But there was a thing and--
oh, I should've picked my battles.

21:40.924 --> 21:43.343
-But I thought I could--
-No excuses, young man.

21:43.427 --> 21:46.346
You're grounded all week.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.807
Hope whatever fun you were having
was worth it.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.602
Upstairs, and give me the baby.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.187
You must be exhausted.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.356
Come on, march.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.528
Hey, uh, Dad.

22:01.611 --> 22:03.739
I'm really sorry the baby and I
missed your show.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.199
I know I'm grounded,
but I was thinking,

22:06.283 --> 22:10.454
if you played really loud, the baby and I
could hear it from our rooms.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.582
You know,
if you felt like putting on another show.

22:22.215 --> 22:23.342
