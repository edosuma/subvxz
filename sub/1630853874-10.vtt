00:11.594 --> 00:13.888
<i>It's the last day of school, folks.</i>

00:13.972 --> 00:16.016
<i>And Devi was feeling good.</i>

00:16.099 --> 00:17.767
<i>She'd moved on from Des</i>,

00:17.851 --> 00:22.605
<i>and was one step closer to the pinnacle</i>
<i>of human existence, senior year.</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:24.733
Devi Vishwakumar, we need to chat.

00:24.816 --> 00:27.360
Oh no. Is this because
I made Mr. Shapiro cry?

00:27.444 --> 00:30.447
All I did was ask him
how the dating apps are treating him.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.158
Relax. Relax.
You're not in trouble for once.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.201
Have you heard
of the Shrubland School?

00:35.785 --> 00:39.748
Uh, yeah? Maybe? Isn't it like
that fancy boarding school in Colorado?

00:39.831 --> 00:40.665
Yes, ma'am.

00:40.749 --> 00:44.919
It is an intensive one-year program
for academically gifted seniors.

00:45.003 --> 00:48.590
Every year, we nominate
our top junior, and you got in.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.550
-I did?
-Mm-hmm.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.178
Whoa. Wait. Can I put
that I got in on my college apps?

00:53.261 --> 00:56.431
You know what would be even better?
Going there.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.974
-Yeah.
-Oh.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.935
Wait. So, like, moving to Colorado?

01:01.019 --> 01:04.314
Yes. All the Shrubland kids
go to the top colleges.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.524
This could be your golden ticket
into Princeton, young lady.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.026
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.153
But just to clarify,

01:10.236 --> 01:13.615
that means I wouldn't be here
in Sherman Oaks for my senior year?

01:13.698 --> 01:16.159
No, Devi. Do we need a geography lesson?

01:16.785 --> 01:18.495
You would have to say goodbye.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.456
Here you go. Congratulations.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.167
You! Give me that gun!

01:25.960 --> 01:27.253
Hmm.

01:38.389 --> 01:40.892
What is that? Holy shit.
Did you get into Shrubland?

01:40.975 --> 01:41.893
Sure did.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.271
Wow, I guess they'll let anyone in.

01:45.355 --> 01:48.483
Hmm. Someone a little butt hurt
that they weren't even nominated?

01:48.566 --> 01:50.944
No, I don't need to go
to some bullshit hippie school

01:51.027 --> 01:52.570
and commune with crystals or whatever.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.781
I'm happy to get into an Ivy
the old-fashioned way.

01:54.864 --> 01:57.659
Oh! Using your dad's connections?
Good for you.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.119
Hmm, any chance you'll leave today?

01:59.202 --> 02:00.745
I actually haven't decided if I'm going.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.997
What? What do you mean
you haven't decided?

02:03.081 --> 02:04.999
Shrubland is the Exeter of the Rockies.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.210
You just called it
a bullshit hippie school.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.379
Yeah, out of pettiness. You have to go.

02:09.462 --> 02:12.590
But do I really want to spend
my last year in a shack in the woods?

02:12.674 --> 02:15.593
What about prom,
or a senior prank, or hazing freshmen?

02:15.677 --> 02:18.096
Okay, <i>Animal House.</i>
You can't haze freshmen anymore.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.807
Trying to get rid of me so you have no
competition for valedictorian next year?

02:20.890 --> 02:24.144
No, although the thought of being able
to dominate the school in peace

02:24.227 --> 02:27.147
without you buzzing behind me like
a bloodthirsty mosquito does sound nice.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.233
-Hmm.
-But for real, David, it's dumb not to go.

02:31.651 --> 02:36.322
<i>While Ben insisted Devi ditch</i>
<i>her John Hughes dreams of senior year,</i>

02:36.406 --> 02:38.783
<i>her friends had a very different stance.</i>

02:38.867 --> 02:43.288
No! You can't leave! Trent is already
abandoning me by graduating.

02:43.371 --> 02:46.708
I know! Like, how can I miss out
on senior year with you guys?

02:46.791 --> 02:50.211
I still feel like we have so much
to accomplish together before college.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.922
I mean, Fabiola and I are still virgins.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.925
Oh, right. Um…

02:56.009 --> 02:58.178
Fab, what's that face?

02:58.261 --> 03:04.309
Okay. So, last week, Addison and I
were watching <i>The Mandalorian</i>,

03:04.392 --> 03:05.351
and it set a mood,

03:05.435 --> 03:08.563
and one thing led to another<i>,</i>
and we did it.

03:08.646 --> 03:11.524
-Fab!
-Oh my God!

03:11.608 --> 03:13.318
You did? That's frigging amazing!

03:13.401 --> 03:15.820
Congratulations
on your loverhood.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.114
Man, I can't believe
you kept that from us.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.618
I'm sorry. It's just
I'm not as announce-y as you guys are.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.245
So, how was it with Addison?

03:24.329 --> 03:26.372
Amazing. I think they awoke
something in me.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.957
I'm a sensual person now.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.292
I sext.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.923
Oh my God.
Do you guys know what this means?

03:35.006 --> 03:37.008
I'm the only virg left.

03:37.091 --> 03:40.178
I thought I'd be the first to do it
because I'm competitive and thirsty.

03:40.261 --> 03:43.014
-Don't worry. It will happen for you.
-Yeah.

03:43.097 --> 03:46.309
Not if I go to this place.
You think these dorks are porkin'?

03:46.392 --> 03:49.270
Forget it. I don't want to miss out
on any milestones with you guys,

03:49.354 --> 03:52.482
and I can't be one of those dusty old nuns
who doesn't lose it until college.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.360
-I'm staying put.
-Really? Thank God.

03:55.443 --> 03:56.444
Yes!

03:57.195 --> 03:58.363
-Yo, yo, yo!
-What up?

03:58.446 --> 04:01.115
-Oh, hey!
-Happy last day of high school ever.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.451
-How you feeling?
-Honestly, it's kind of bittersweet.

04:04.035 --> 04:07.455
I just can't believe that after today
we won't go here anymore.

04:07.538 --> 04:08.957
I need a drink of water.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.209
Is he okay?

04:11.292 --> 04:12.794
No, he's not.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.922
You guys,
he's in such denial about graduating.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.549
He won't talk about it.
He won't clean out his locker.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.593
He's just completely shutting down.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.054
Yeah, he's been pretty weird
for the last week.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.056
Like, even weird by Trent standards.

04:25.139 --> 04:28.101
I think he's really scared
he has to go out and find a job.

04:28.184 --> 04:30.311
But I also think he's sad
to be leaving me.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.729
Aw, El!

04:31.813 --> 04:33.982
Yeah. I don't know
what I'm gonna do without him.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.942
Oh, he's coming back.
Someone change the subject.

04:36.025 --> 04:39.362
Uh, Paxton, I heard you got class speaker.
That's dope.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.240
Oh, yeah. I was really honored
that people voted for me.

04:42.323 --> 04:46.327
No offense, but I don't get why we vote
on who speaks at graduation.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.205
Why don't we just let the valedictorian
talk like at other schools?

04:49.289 --> 04:52.292
Well, I volley your no offense back to you
to say that nerds are boring,

04:52.375 --> 04:54.168
and popular kids are fun and hilarious.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.128
Word.

04:55.211 --> 04:56.337
<i>Trent wasn't wrong.</i>

04:56.421 --> 04:59.299
<i>The popular kids had given</i>
<i>some memorable speeches.</i>

04:59.382 --> 05:01.259
Shit. I am so drunk.

05:01.342 --> 05:02.844
I love you guys!

05:02.927 --> 05:07.348
And I just want to say
to all you stupid bitches who doubted me,

05:07.432 --> 05:09.017
you're dead to me.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.269
Later losers!

05:11.352 --> 05:12.812
Well, I'm sure you're gonna crush it.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.439
Yeah, I hope so.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.650
Are you talking about your speech?
You should do like a sexy dance.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.944
Uh, I don't think so, Shira.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.905
You have to do something hot.
'Cause that's like what you're known for.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.824
I'm known for more than that.

05:24.907 --> 05:28.453
I mean,
that is what your senior superlative is.

05:29.662 --> 05:34.584
"Paxton Hall-Yoshida.
Most likely to succeed at hotness"?

05:36.252 --> 05:37.086
Yeah.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.672
So, Devi, how was your last day at school?

05:39.756 --> 05:41.799
Did anything interesting happen?

05:41.883 --> 05:45.845
Mmm, some seniors used some shaving cream
to draw genitalia on the school buses.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.056
Yeah. Terrible.

05:48.139 --> 05:49.724
You're sure shaving cream genitalia

05:49.807 --> 05:51.768
was the most interesting thing
that happened today?

05:51.851 --> 05:53.686
-Mmm.
-Honestly, Devi?

05:53.770 --> 05:55.855
I want to know
about this fancy school you got into.

05:55.938 --> 05:57.607
Principal Grubbs called me.

05:57.690 --> 06:00.693
You think she goes around telling children
about life-changing opportunities

06:00.777 --> 06:03.946
and is like, "Eh, parents don't need
to know"? Get me the brochure.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.866
-It's not that big of a deal.
-It actually is a big deal.

06:06.949 --> 06:10.453
Nobody can get into that school.
I applied to teach there. Rejected.

06:10.536 --> 06:11.829
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

06:11.913 --> 06:15.458
It's for the best. You are too delicate,
Manish, to live at high altitude.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.378
Burn. I thought you liked me now.

06:18.461 --> 06:21.672
I love you, which is why
I worry about how weak you are.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.299
Okay, back to Devi.

06:23.383 --> 06:27.136
I think what we're all trying to say is
we're so impressed you got into Shrubland.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.014
Half of the <i>Scientific American's</i>
20 under 20 went there.

06:30.098 --> 06:34.018
So, uh, you would leave
a year early to go here?

06:34.102 --> 06:37.397
If I were going, yeah. But I already made
up my mind to turn them down.

06:37.480 --> 06:41.234
Are you sure? This school seems like
it could really set you up for success.

06:41.317 --> 06:44.779
Mom, if I needed this school to get
into Princeton, I would go. But I don't.

06:44.862 --> 06:47.365
I have sick grades.
I'm in a billion extracurriculars,

06:47.448 --> 06:50.576
and I have all of my teachers
wrapped around my finger. Right, Mr. K?

06:50.660 --> 06:52.328
-What?
-It's your choice, Devi.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.789
You don't want to go.
I'm not gonna push you.

06:54.872 --> 06:57.500
Really? Um, you're not even
going to go visit?

06:58.292 --> 07:00.878
Honestly, I'm not quite ready
to send her off yet, either.

07:01.838 --> 07:05.216
So, <i>Mami</i>,
what customer service representative

07:05.299 --> 07:06.884
did you scream at today?

07:11.764 --> 07:13.266
Hi, I think we're gonna head out.

07:13.349 --> 07:17.687
Oh, okay. Uh, please thank Manish
for introducing us to TikTok pasta chips.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.564
They were very unique.

07:19.647 --> 07:20.857
I will.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.694
So, listen, I don't wanna interfere,

07:24.777 --> 07:27.029
but I do think
that you should reconsider Shrubland.

07:27.113 --> 07:30.324
I was terrified
to leave my home and my family,

07:30.408 --> 07:32.201
but I'm so thankful that I did

07:32.285 --> 07:36.038
because CalTech has been
this unbelievable opportunity for me.

07:36.122 --> 07:39.208
I never would've grown so much
if my family hadn't pushed me to come.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.628
I'm sorry if I'm overstepping.
I just had to say it.

07:43.212 --> 07:44.213
Okay. Good night.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.423
Good night, Kamala.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.259
I appreciate it.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.302
Of course.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.186
<i>I want to go back to India.</i>
<i>I hate it here.</i>

07:58.895 --> 08:03.524
You hate all of America because some moms
at Devi's preschool were rude to you?

08:04.108 --> 08:06.903
They weren't just rude to me,
they were cruel.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.615
You should have seen their faces
when I put my <i>korma </i>down at the potluck.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.366
They treat me like I'm nothing.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.161
They always act like
they can't understand my accent.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.205
They talk to me like I'm a child.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.250
Am I supposed to endure this
until Devi gets to college?

08:21.334 --> 08:23.127
No, and it will get better.

08:23.211 --> 08:26.422
But the reason we sacrificed
so much to come here

08:26.506 --> 08:27.715
was so that our child

08:27.798 --> 08:30.593
would have every opportunity
to get the best education.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.846
We can't let our needs
stand in the way of that.

08:37.058 --> 08:40.353
In the meantime,
why don't we get on the computer

08:40.436 --> 08:42.480
and subscribe those ladies
to a lot of spam?

08:55.159 --> 08:58.371
If they kill off the Indian character,
I'm writing to Netflix.

08:58.454 --> 08:59.580
Uh, <i>Pati,</i>

08:59.664 --> 09:03.000
I think the whole point of <i>Squid Game</i>
is that a lot of people have to die.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.378
-Devi!
-Oh my God!

09:05.461 --> 09:07.255
We're gonna go visit that school
in Colorado.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.590
I've already booked the tickets.
There'll be no discussion.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.008
Hmm?

09:15.555 --> 09:18.599
Yeah, so she's like demanding
I go to this Colorado school

09:18.683 --> 09:20.977
that's basically
where <i>The Shining</i> happened.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.603
I don't need to see no creepy twins.

09:22.687 --> 09:27.066
All right, well, it sounds like your mom
just wants you to visit the school, Devi.

09:27.149 --> 09:30.486
It's not like she's gonna throw you
off the train in the Rocky Mountains.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.738
But it's still a waste of time.
I'm never gonna go there.

09:32.822 --> 09:33.906
So why do I have to visit?

09:33.990 --> 09:35.575
Because you should give it a chance.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.035
You never know.
It could be an amazing opportunity.

09:38.119 --> 09:41.497
Dr. Ryan, I've been planning
my senior year since I hit puberty.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.457
And it has to happen
at my normal high school

09:43.541 --> 09:47.211
doing normal senior stuff
with my mostly normal friends.

09:47.295 --> 09:50.423
Not in the woods with a bunch
of randos with visible pit hair.

09:50.506 --> 09:53.426
Look, I'm not saying
that you have to attend.

09:53.509 --> 09:57.513
I'm just saying it's important
to be open to new experiences.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.723
-Ugh.
-Devi, look.

09:58.806 --> 10:03.185
When you lock yourself
into a dream of what your life should be,

10:03.269 --> 10:04.729
you limit yourself.

10:05.229 --> 10:10.943
And I know for a fact, you, Devi,
are locked into a very particular dream.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.529
<i>You want to date</i>
<i>the hottest guy in school.</i>

10:13.613 --> 10:18.534
<i>You want to be Miss Popularity,</i>
<i>and you just got to go to Princeton.</i>

10:18.618 --> 10:20.328
I will not budge on Princeton.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.414
All I'm saying is
maybe you've outgrown that dream.

10:23.497 --> 10:27.501
I mean, are you still
the same Devi you were freshman year?

10:28.544 --> 10:29.545
I'm not.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.173
You definitely don't say
"word up" as much.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.591
Come on, Doc.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.718
Just try to be open.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.595
Baby, the world is big.

10:38.095 --> 10:40.681
Sometimes it's good to surprise yourself.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.521
Ah. Look, Trent.

10:47.605 --> 10:51.108
Paxton picked up his cap and gown.
How about you? Did you go get yours?

10:51.192 --> 10:52.109
Don't worry about it.

10:52.735 --> 10:53.944
I am worried about it.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.906
-You know graduation's in two days, right?
-Totally.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.700
Babe, I know leaving school is scary,

10:59.784 --> 11:03.496
but I just saw that Buca di Beppo is
looking for a new pasta associate.

11:03.579 --> 11:06.290
That could be a really exciting
new adventure for you.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.751
-Uh-huh.
-Paxton, can you please help?

11:08.834 --> 11:11.545
If you don't show up to graduation,
I'll tell Marcus he's my best friend.

11:11.629 --> 11:12.546
I'll be there, bro.

11:12.630 --> 11:16.258
Great. Now, if you could both take
this conversation outside of my garage,

11:16.342 --> 11:17.677
I gotta finish my speech.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.886
How's that coming?

11:18.969 --> 11:22.014
Do you need me to text Devi for help?
She loves giving speeches,

11:22.098 --> 11:24.433
although mostly in the form of apologies.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.227
No. For the first time,

11:26.310 --> 11:28.437
I think I actually know
exactly what I want to say.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.689
Hmm.

11:43.994 --> 11:47.415
Wow, Devi, look at this place.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.167
Everyone looks so happy and active.

11:50.751 --> 11:54.130
Mmm, it's too outdoorsy. What if a bear
attacks me on my way to class?

11:54.213 --> 11:56.882
You know I smell delicious
because of all the sugar I eat.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.719
We actually do have
a bear family that visit sometimes,

11:59.802 --> 12:01.887
but the only thing they ever attack
is our dumpster.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.181
-Hi, are you the Vishwakumars?

12:04.265 --> 12:06.684
Yes, hi. This is Devi.
I'm her mom, Nalini.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.185
You must be Mr. Ferris?

12:08.269 --> 12:09.437
Oh no, call me Leo.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.189
At Shrublands, students refer
to teachers by their first names.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.359
See, Devi? You love
disrespectful nonsense like this.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.987
We think it's important
to empower young adults

12:18.070 --> 12:20.656
to see themselves
as intellectual equals with teachers.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.826
Sure, until you have to tuck 'em in
for lights out at, like, what,00 p.m.?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.745
Oh no, we have flexible curfews.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.330
A lot of the study groups
for the college-level courses

12:28.414 --> 12:30.416
meet in the library pretty late.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.752
College-level courses? Whoa.

12:32.835 --> 12:33.878
Let me give you a tour,

12:33.961 --> 12:37.047
and then, Devi, I'd love for you
to sit in on my next class,

12:37.131 --> 12:38.883
Comparative Literature
and Cultural Theory.

12:38.966 --> 12:42.094
Oh. What an impressive long name.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.524
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.693
Did you accidentally leave your art stuff
behind too?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.320
No, I didn't forget.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.781
I just couldn't fit it
in the basket of my bicycle,

13:01.864 --> 13:03.741
so my dad drove me here
to pick everything up.

13:03.824 --> 13:04.825
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.578
You ride to school on a bicycle
with a little basket on it?

13:07.661 --> 13:09.121
Yeah, what about it?

13:09.205 --> 13:12.500
You just seem like you'd get dropped off
on a Harley by some tatted-up boyfriend.

13:13.542 --> 13:16.962
Nope. No Harley, no boyfriend.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.840
Hmm. So, you're not like punk rock at all?

13:21.425 --> 13:23.427
Uh, you want to know
what my summer job is?

13:23.511 --> 13:26.180
-Mmm.
-I'm working at Build-A-Bear in the mall.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.348
What?

13:27.431 --> 13:28.933
We're open seven days a week.

13:29.016 --> 13:32.561
I wear a tiny apron and tell kids that
a synthetic lump of stuffing loves them.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.272
-You should come by.
Yeah. I want to see that. I'm there.

13:35.356 --> 13:39.568
It's a date. I mean, it doesn't have
to be, like, a "date" date. Sorry…

13:39.652 --> 13:41.278
-Uh…
-I'd go on a date.

13:42.071 --> 13:42.905
Oh.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.200
Okay. Cool.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.161
Then we'll go on a date.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.246
Cool.

13:51.956 --> 13:55.960
Oh, well, as fun as it is
silently staring at each other,

13:56.043 --> 14:00.506
I've, uh, got to get back to the car.
My dad overheats easily.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.007
Great. Okay.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.426
Well, I'll call you.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.312
You guys, we have a visitor with us today.

14:15.396 --> 14:18.107
Everyone, say hey to Devi.
She might be joining us next year.

14:18.983 --> 14:22.736
Hi, everyone. Your school is so beautiful
and smells amazing.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.405
Way better than our Glade plugins.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.531
Thank you, Devi.

14:25.614 --> 14:29.827
All right, everyone, I hope you all had
a chance to finish <i>Ficciones</i> last night.

14:29.910 --> 14:30.828
-Yep.
-Oh, yeah.

14:30.911 --> 14:32.955
Okay, so let's do what we do.

14:33.038 --> 14:36.917
I thought it was so interesting how a lot
of his narrators had his own name.

14:37.001 --> 14:41.505
Yeah, I noticed that too. It's like,
they're not him, but they are him.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.257
Yeah, that's exactly right.
Like…

14:43.340 --> 14:45.759
<i>Devi had never been</i>
<i>in a class like this before,</i>

14:45.843 --> 14:47.928
<i>and not because everyone</i>
<i>was sitting on the ground</i>

14:48.012 --> 14:49.972
<i>and talking without raising their hand.</i>

14:50.055 --> 14:52.683
<i>It was that everyone</i>
<i>had actually done their homework</i>

14:52.766 --> 14:54.476
<i>and cared about learning something.</i>

14:54.560 --> 14:57.688
Also, did you notice
the labyrinth motif kept coming up?

14:58.188 --> 15:00.858
That really felt like
a commentary on free will.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.485
What do labyrinths
make you think of, Devi?

15:04.361 --> 15:07.948
Oh, um, I actually haven't read
the book. Sorry.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.950
Oh, don't be sorry.
I know you haven't read it.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.869
I'm just trying to pick your brain.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.997
Mazes, labyrinths.
What do they signify to you?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.458
Oh. Uh…

15:19.168 --> 15:21.420
That there's no one straight path in life?

15:21.503 --> 15:26.842
That we have choices
and some can lead us to dead ends,

15:26.926 --> 15:31.096
but others can take us to places
we never thought we'd go.

15:32.139 --> 15:34.433
Wow. I love it. Thank you, Devi.

15:34.516 --> 15:35.476
Okay.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.734
And, like, you can talk
and express yourself,

15:43.817 --> 15:45.277
and it's cool to be smart.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.445
As it should be.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.948
And there's no UN or Hot Pocket.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.741
Everyone's kind of a nerd.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.618
I think I actually might fit in.

15:53.535 --> 15:55.871
Do either of you want
to switch seats with me

15:55.955 --> 15:58.248
since you're talking
to each other so much?

15:58.332 --> 16:00.501
-No, no. We don't like the middle seat.
-Mm-mm.

16:00.584 --> 16:01.418
Okay, and then?

16:02.211 --> 16:05.130
Mom, I think I want to go.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.548
-You do?
-Mm-hmm.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.596
-Do you want the popcorn?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ooh.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.515
-I got, uh, smoked almonds. Do ya--
-Yeah.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.270
But I thought you said
you didn't want to go!

16:20.354 --> 16:22.940
I know, but once I got there, I liked it.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.025
The competitive part
of me really kicked in.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.860
But what about the horny part of you?

16:26.944 --> 16:29.238
Remember, there are
no sexual prospects there

16:29.321 --> 16:30.948
because they're all crunchy uggos.

16:31.031 --> 16:33.951
Well, then I guess I'll have
to be cool being the sad sack

16:34.034 --> 16:35.411
who goes to college as a virgin.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.539
But, hey, maybe I'll lose it
to a sexy professor

16:38.622 --> 16:40.666
that'll educate me in more ways than one.

16:40.749 --> 16:43.293
All right, it's hard to argue
with that fantasy.

16:43.377 --> 16:48.716
Guys, I know this screws up our plans
for senior year, but I'll be back.

16:48.799 --> 16:52.302
I mean, you both already have
so many cool things going on anyway.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.764
Eleanor, you have your
fancy Hollywood agent and Trent.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.225
And, Fabiola, you're with Addison now.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.978
You guys won't notice that I'm gone.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.605
Not true. But regardless,
you don't leave until the fall.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.898
We still have the summer.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.775
We don't need to be
sad about it right now.

17:07.735 --> 17:09.695
-Oh. We should sit down.
-Yep.

17:14.783 --> 17:17.619
Trent, what are you doing?
Get up there with your class.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.996
They're not my class.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.456
Yes, they are. Go!

17:20.539 --> 17:21.623
No, they're not.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.542
Eleanor, I failed.

17:24.251 --> 17:27.087
I failed senior year,
and now I have to repeat it.

17:27.755 --> 17:28.797
You failed?

17:28.881 --> 17:30.299
I'm so embarrassed.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.633
I didn't want to tell you

17:31.717 --> 17:34.595
'cause I couldn't bear
to see the disappointment in your face.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.557
I'm not disappointed. I'm thrilled.

17:38.640 --> 17:43.353
We get to be together for another year.
Thank God you're so terrible at school.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.238
Thank you, Mr. Wadsworth,

17:53.322 --> 17:55.908
for that riveting discussion
on men's rights.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.951
Shawna, next year I'm gonna need to see

17:58.035 --> 18:00.245
the alumni speech
ahead of time, okay? All right.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.248
Alrighty, class of 2022.

18:03.832 --> 18:06.794
Ah. I think you're gonna be very excited
about our next speaker

18:06.877 --> 18:08.420
because you voted for him.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.173
So please welcome Mr. Paxton Hall-Yoshida.

18:15.636 --> 18:16.804
That's my best friend!

18:19.681 --> 18:21.183
-Hi.
-I'm in love with you!

18:21.266 --> 18:22.851
-Thank you.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.230
So, listen, I know
you're all expecting me to, like,

18:26.313 --> 18:29.650
take a shot on stage
or do a sexy dance or whatever.

18:34.530 --> 18:35.864
But I'm not gonna do that.

18:36.365 --> 18:39.284
Instead, I'm gonna talk about hard work.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.370
-Boo!
-Trent. Come on, man.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.831
Sorry. Reflex. I love you, bro.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.798
For the longest time,
I never really had to work that hard.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.552
And honestly,
things came really easily for me

18:56.635 --> 18:59.680
because I was dope at swimming,
and according to the yearbook,

18:59.763 --> 19:01.056
I'm kind of pretty.

19:05.477 --> 19:08.522
But then someone
showed me how to push myself.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.650
<i>Whoa.</i>
<i>He's talking about you, Devi.</i>

19:11.733 --> 19:13.610
<i>That's kind of romantic, right?</i>

19:14.111 --> 19:17.489
And that person made me
try things that I was bad at.

19:17.573 --> 19:21.994
-Like studying. And it sucked so bad.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.371
But I am so grateful.

19:25.789 --> 19:29.168
Because now I know
that I'm more than just the hot guy

19:29.251 --> 19:30.627
or the popular guy.

19:31.336 --> 19:35.632
I'm actually a really nice guy
and a sort of smart guy.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.386
My advice to you is
to push yourself out there,

19:39.887 --> 19:41.722
defy other people's expectations of you,

19:42.222 --> 19:44.349
and don't ever let a label define you.

19:46.059 --> 19:49.730
And with that, I would like
to hand the mic over to someone who

19:50.397 --> 19:55.068
actually really earned the right to speak,
our valedictorian Brenda Kang.

19:59.990 --> 20:03.911
<i>Hold up.</i>
<i>Devi, why isn't your stomach in knots?</i>

20:03.994 --> 20:08.332
<i>Paxton H-Y basically gave a speech</i>
<i>about you to the entire school.</i>

20:08.415 --> 20:09.750
<i>Do you feel okay?</i>

20:09.833 --> 20:10.876
<i>Are you drunk?</i>

20:11.543 --> 20:16.089
Oh my God.
I am so happy Trent has to stay back.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.467
I don't think
I could handle losing the both of you

20:18.550 --> 20:20.510
now that you're going to Colorado, Devi.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.595
You're going?

20:22.179 --> 20:25.599
Hey, uh, yeah. I just decided.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.726
Okay.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.937
We'll call you later.

20:30.020 --> 20:30.854
O-Okay.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.441
Then I guess I should congratulate you.

20:34.524 --> 20:35.984
Mmm. And I, you.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.654
Now the school's all yours.
Enjoy your reign of terror.

20:38.737 --> 20:39.738
Yeah, right.

20:41.031 --> 20:45.535
It's just that, uh,
I don't want you to go, David.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.037
Sure. Sure, sure, sure.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.374
'Cause you need my annoying personality
to fuel your competitive drive.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.376
I don't think
your personality is annoying.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.920
Hey, I… I like your personality.

20:55.003 --> 20:57.673
-You call me annoying twice a day.
-Yeah, as a joke.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.801
Okay,
then why don't you want me to go?

21:02.177 --> 21:03.053
Because…

21:04.805 --> 21:05.847
I'll miss you.

21:07.641 --> 21:08.517
A lot.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.646
<i>Wait, there's the stomach knots.</i>

21:17.276 --> 21:18.652
Lil' D!

21:19.319 --> 21:21.154
-Medium B!

21:23.115 --> 21:24.658
Wow, you did so good up there.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.994
And you made Trent cry.
So mission accomplished.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.288
-Yeah, excellent work, bro.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.414
Thanks, guys.

21:30.497 --> 21:33.083
There were a few girls in the front row
who seemed genuinely pissed

21:33.166 --> 21:34.543
I didn't do a sexy dance,

21:34.626 --> 21:36.378
but otherwise, I felt good.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.713
Nice.

21:38.463 --> 21:41.300
Okay, uh, I got to run,
but, uh, congrats, Paxton.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.467
Thanks, man.

21:48.265 --> 21:50.434
So, did you hear my shoutout to you?

21:51.184 --> 21:53.353
I did. Thank you for that.

21:53.437 --> 21:54.521
Yeah.

21:54.604 --> 21:57.065
Well, I owe you a lot, Devi.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.484
I know we've had some ups and downs,

21:59.568 --> 22:02.738
but I probably wouldn't be going
to college if it weren't for you.

22:04.114 --> 22:08.035
Well, I actually have
a lot to thank you for too.

22:08.618 --> 22:12.789
This is a weird thing to say,
and I don't want to creep you out,

22:14.041 --> 22:14.875
but…

22:17.085 --> 22:19.838
…you kind of got me
through the death of my dad.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.342
I did? How?

22:25.302 --> 22:27.304
By being a dream.

22:30.807 --> 22:33.560
Well, hey, you should come visit me
in Arizona some time.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.562
I'll let you do
some of my college-level homework.

22:35.645 --> 22:37.898
-Yeah. Ow! Okay.
-Ah. Seriously?

22:37.981 --> 22:38.857
Paxton!

22:38.940 --> 22:39.858
Dad!

22:40.442 --> 22:42.652
-I'll see ya.
-Oh!

22:43.153 --> 22:45.113
-Oh.

22:45.197 --> 22:48.241
Your dad's been crying
since the moment you got on the stage.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.993
I'm just so proud of you.

22:50.577 --> 22:51.912
You were amazing.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.040
-Thanks, Dad.
-Okay, my turn.

<i>As Devi walked home,</i>

23:00.879 --> 23:03.673
<i>she realized that she had spent</i>
<i>so much of her young life</i>

23:03.757 --> 23:05.592
<i>obsessed with the future.</i>

23:05.675 --> 23:08.053
<i>A future where she would finally fit in.</i>

23:09.012 --> 23:12.766
<i>But if today taught her anything,</i>
<i>it was that she already fit in.</i>

23:12.849 --> 23:16.728
<i>And as her father proved,</i>
<i>there are no guarantees in this life.</i>

23:17.229 --> 23:20.774
<i>Suddenly, she felt like the present</i>
<i>was a very precious thing,</i>

23:21.358 --> 23:23.026
<i>and she did not want to waste it.</i>

23:37.958 --> 23:38.959
Mom.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.671
Devi? Are you okay?

23:42.754 --> 23:43.797
I don't want to go.

23:44.756 --> 23:46.758
Uh, you don't want to go where?

23:46.842 --> 23:48.802
To the Shrubland School.

23:48.885 --> 23:52.013
Of course you're going.
We decided.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.516
No, I don't want to leave you yet.

23:57.644 --> 23:58.854
Devi, you have to.

23:59.479 --> 24:02.482
It's for your future.
It's what your father would have wanted.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.193
But I have memories of Dad too,

24:05.277 --> 24:07.404
and he would want us to be together.

24:08.321 --> 24:11.450
I just… I need one more year with you.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.745
We don't know what's gonna happen.

24:15.829 --> 24:16.913
Okay? Look at Dad.

24:17.998 --> 24:20.917
I just… I need more time with you.

24:22.752 --> 24:23.837
Is that okay?

24:28.008 --> 24:31.303
Yeah. It's okay, <i>kanna</i>.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.271
But only one more year.

24:41.354 --> 24:43.398
You can't be like Carol's son
from down the street

24:43.482 --> 24:45.233
who's still living with his mother at 50.

24:49.905 --> 24:52.699
<i>Devi had listened</i>

24:52.782 --> 24:53.742
<i>She'd been open,</i>

24:53.825 --> 24:57.078
<i>and even though she was staying</i>
<i>in Sherman Oaks for senior year,</i>

24:57.162 --> 24:58.580

25:07.464 --> 25:08.381
Hmm.

Hmm?

25:17.098 --> 25:18.934

Hi. Patty let me in.

Okay. What can I help you with?
