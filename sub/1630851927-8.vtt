00:26.543 --> 00:27.544
- John, will you say Grace?

00:30.616 --> 00:32.170
- Dear Lord, bless
this food for our use

00:32.239 --> 00:33.412
and us for thy service,

00:33.481 --> 00:34.724
and please make us mindful
of the needs

00:34.793 --> 00:36.346
and feelings of others, Amen.

00:38.555 --> 00:40.661
- That's all God
gets tonight?

00:40.730 --> 00:42.042
Nothing for your father?

00:48.255 --> 00:50.015
- And please help Daddy find
those horse-thieving cowards

00:50.084 --> 00:51.706
and hang them from
the nearest tree.

00:51.775 --> 00:54.778
- You think that's funny?

00:54.847 --> 00:57.298
You don't pray for harm
to come to anyone, son.

00:57.367 --> 00:58.713
You pray that your father

00:58.782 --> 01:02.303
and the men riding with
him make it home safe to us.

01:02.372 --> 01:04.650
That is the prayer.

01:04.719 --> 01:07.688
And that's the only prayer,
do you understand me?

01:09.690 --> 01:11.278
- Yes, ma'am.

01:19.113 --> 01:20.080
Now say it again.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.502
- Dear Lord, please watch
over our father

01:28.571 --> 01:31.298
as he seeks justice
in your name. Amen.

01:32.333 --> 01:34.094
- Amen.

01:59.222 --> 02:00.810
- They're making for the trees!

02:00.879 --> 02:03.192
They get to cover
they'll tear us to pieces!

02:03.261 --> 02:04.745
- Run faster, God damnit!

02:04.814 --> 02:05.815
- Jesus!

02:20.968 --> 02:22.349
- Let 'em get close!

02:34.326 --> 02:35.707
- Don't stop!

03:12.882 --> 03:14.228
- Ah!

03:24.825 --> 03:25.826
Ah!

03:31.694 --> 03:34.662
Ah! God!

03:34.731 --> 03:36.664
Stop!

03:36.733 --> 03:38.390
Stop, God damn it!

03:39.805 --> 03:42.187
Ah!

03:45.294 --> 03:46.467
- You scream.

03:59.756 --> 04:01.068
- You shot?

04:01.137 --> 04:03.035
- Sorry son of a bitch
bucked me off.

04:04.485 --> 04:05.866
What're we gonna do with him?

04:06.970 --> 04:08.282
- Advertise.

04:15.634 --> 04:16.842
All right.

04:23.021 --> 04:26.714
I don't care if you live
or die, but should you live...

04:28.371 --> 04:29.924
You tell them about me.

04:31.512 --> 04:32.893
- Tell who?

04:36.655 --> 04:37.898
- Everybody like you.

04:46.734 --> 04:48.426
- All right.

05:23.771 --> 05:24.807
- Hey.

05:24.876 --> 05:26.740
- Good Lord.

05:26.809 --> 05:29.294
What happened?
What happened?

05:29.363 --> 05:30.364
- What had to happen.

05:31.641 --> 05:32.780
- No!

05:32.849 --> 05:34.403
- That's not mine.

05:34.472 --> 05:36.232
- Get inside.
Get inside!

05:36.301 --> 05:37.267
- I'm not getting blood
all over your floor,

05:37.337 --> 05:38.234
I'll strip down out here.

05:38.303 --> 05:39.787
- I don't care about my floor!

05:39.856 --> 05:41.548
- Spencer!
Water boiling now.
- I'll strip down.

05:45.414 --> 05:46.794
- Just go help your mama.

05:46.863 --> 05:48.106
-
- Help your mama.

05:52.662 --> 05:54.802
Shit.

05:54.871 --> 05:57.702
You can't let me die out here.

05:57.771 --> 06:00.463
They won't make it.

06:00.532 --> 06:03.052
James Dillard?
Get inside.

06:03.121 --> 06:05.675
- Shit.

06:05.744 --> 06:06.987
- Get inside.

06:13.303 --> 06:15.375
- Oh, Lord. No!

06:15.444 --> 06:16.376
No!

07:35.627 --> 07:37.560
- Is this enough room
for you, baby?

07:37.629 --> 07:39.631
What do you think?

07:39.700 --> 07:41.909
- I have five shirts
and a pair of boots, Beth.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.708
- You are the perfect man.

07:52.713 --> 07:53.921
I gotta go to work.

07:56.165 --> 07:57.856
- Yep. Me too.

08:05.105 --> 08:06.278
- Son...

08:06.347 --> 08:08.315
You can beat him.
- How?

08:08.384 --> 08:11.007
How can I beat him?

08:11.076 --> 08:13.596
Every politician in the state
owes him a favor.

08:15.425 --> 08:17.807
The one thing I had
was name recognition.

08:17.876 --> 08:19.568
But it's his name.

08:19.637 --> 08:21.086
Now he has it.

08:21.155 --> 08:23.364
- Son...

08:23.433 --> 08:24.883
- He's gonna use
everything against me.

08:24.952 --> 08:25.953
He's gonna use you against me.

08:26.022 --> 08:27.092
- He won't.

08:29.923 --> 08:30.889
- The fuck he won't.

08:32.442 --> 08:34.652
- You know where all
the bodies are buried--

08:34.721 --> 08:37.862
- Yeah, because I buried them.

08:37.931 --> 08:39.484
- Maybe so, but they're
not your bodies.

08:42.487 --> 08:44.627
You set up a meeting with him,

08:44.696 --> 08:47.285
and the two of you
decide what's off limits.

08:49.839 --> 08:51.634
- The world's gonna
find out about you anyway.

08:51.703 --> 08:53.084
- Let the world
find out about me.

08:53.153 --> 08:54.223
We tell the world about me.

08:54.292 --> 08:55.431
We control the narrative.

08:56.708 --> 08:58.848
I acted in defense
of my only child.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.335
That's all the world
gets to know.

09:03.404 --> 09:05.959
You're the Attorney General.
You can seal the record.

09:07.892 --> 09:09.583
- Only a judge
can seal the record.

09:09.652 --> 09:11.102
- What judge owes you a favor?

09:12.448 --> 09:13.967
- None.

09:14.036 --> 09:16.417
- Then find one, or invent one.
Whichever you can do fastest.

09:18.523 --> 09:20.490
- Am I a fool
for even considering this?

09:22.907 --> 09:24.529
- He's the fool, Jamie.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.635
Who's going to vote for him?

09:26.704 --> 09:28.706
The environmentalists?

09:28.775 --> 09:31.329
The transplants
from New York or L.A.?

09:31.398 --> 09:33.952
To them, he is the face
of everything in this world

09:34.021 --> 09:36.023
they have been taught

09:36.092 --> 09:39.302
a white,
sixty-year-old landowner.

09:40.856 --> 09:42.685
Use everything
he is against him.

09:44.860 --> 09:47.310
What does your father covet
more than anything?

09:49.692 --> 09:51.142
- Power.

09:51.211 --> 09:54.524
- And what office holds
the most power in this state?

09:55.767 --> 09:56.941
Livestock Commissioner?

09:58.287 --> 09:59.944
The Governor.

10:00.013 --> 10:02.878
So, if it's power he wants,
why hasn't he run before?

10:04.914 --> 10:08.608
Because he knows
he can't win, Jamie.

10:08.677 --> 10:11.714
He isn't running for Governor.
He's running against you.

10:11.783 --> 10:13.095
And as soon as you drop out,

10:13.164 --> 10:16.339
he'll pick a candidate
to replace him.

10:16.408 --> 10:17.651
He's bluffing, Jamie.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.034
Call him on it.

10:23.899 --> 10:24.865
- Yeah.

10:28.075 --> 10:29.456
Yeah.

10:33.046 --> 10:35.393
Yeah, set up
a press conference.

11:14.397 --> 11:16.296
- I say we press charges
for trespassing

11:16.365 --> 11:18.505
and destruction
of private property.

11:18.574 --> 11:20.714
- Oh, nice of you to join us.

11:20.783 --> 11:26.237
- Sorry. Protestors
are blocking the road.

11:26.306 --> 11:28.066
Took me a while to get through.

11:28.135 --> 11:29.827
- They're blocking
a public roadway.

11:29.896 --> 11:32.174
Sheriff's department isn't
doing anything about it?

11:32.243 --> 11:33.796
- What are twelve deputies
going to do

11:33.865 --> 11:36.109
about 350 protestors?

11:36.178 --> 11:38.042
- Get me the
Attorney General's office

11:38.111 --> 11:40.182
and the Governor's office.

11:40.251 --> 11:43.116
This is not a protest.
It's an occupation.

11:43.185 --> 11:46.360
I want them charged today.

11:46.429 --> 11:48.121
- Well, I'd be careful
if I were you.

11:48.190 --> 11:51.124
The last thing that
we need is these people

11:51.193 --> 11:52.953
Facebooking their friends
in New York

11:53.022 --> 11:55.784
and then we have protestors
outside our building

11:55.853 --> 11:58.752
on Wall Street with
national news coverage.

11:58.821 --> 12:00.581
- Are you suggesting
we do nothing?

12:00.650 --> 12:02.825
- No, I'm suggesting
we be careful.

12:02.894 --> 12:05.483
The first thing I would do
is get the press out of there.

12:05.552 --> 12:07.968
- Mm-mm, we can't tell
the press to leave.

12:08.037 --> 12:11.627
- Of course you can.
It's private property, right?

12:11.696 --> 12:12.870
Once we get the press
out of there

12:12.939 --> 12:14.664
we don't have to be
careful anymore.

12:16.149 --> 12:17.529
- And then?

12:17.598 --> 12:21.499
- Once the press is gone
you can press charges, right?

12:21.568 --> 12:22.983
And then
the Sheriff's Department,

12:23.052 --> 12:25.123
they can drag them out
by their hippie hair.

12:25.192 --> 12:27.954
- Removing the press
makes it a bigger story.

12:28.023 --> 12:31.060
- Removing the press
becomes the story.

12:31.129 --> 12:33.580
Let them bitch about
that all they want.

12:35.168 --> 12:37.446
people in Montana,
they don't like bad news.

12:37.515 --> 12:40.104
They moved here
to escape all that shit.

12:40.173 --> 12:41.726
They want to know the weather,

12:41.795 --> 12:44.073
they want to know what
time the rodeo starts

12:44.142 --> 12:45.972
and they want to know
who the Bobcats are playing.

12:46.041 --> 12:48.319
If they want bad news
they'll watch CNN.

12:48.388 --> 12:51.598
And CNN ain't here.

12:51.667 --> 12:55.050
- Well, I'm not sure the New
Yorker in me can trust that.

12:55.119 --> 12:58.432
- Well, you're not in
New York now, buddy.

12:58.501 --> 13:00.400
Your instincts
are worthless here.

13:02.574 --> 13:07.234
- Ellis, inform the press
to vacate our property.

13:07.303 --> 13:08.373
- I can do it.

13:11.411 --> 13:12.792
They'll take it
better from a local.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.672
- Horses!
-

13:31.741 --> 13:34.123
- Tampico.

13:34.192 --> 13:36.332
- Looks good.
- Yeah.

13:36.401 --> 13:38.438
- Bay horse?
- Yeah.

13:38.507 --> 13:40.820
- Stringbean, think you
can handle him?

13:40.889 --> 13:42.166
- Yes, sir.

13:44.962 --> 13:45.997
Thank you.

13:51.002 --> 13:52.072
- Here we go, here we go.

13:53.177 --> 13:54.454
Yes, sir.

13:54.523 --> 13:56.974
- All right.

13:57.043 --> 13:58.182
- You roped him?

13:58.251 --> 14:00.667
- Got thrown at him.

14:03.290 --> 14:05.810
- Horses!
- Curly Bill back there.

14:05.879 --> 14:08.986
- Get done? I'll help you.
- Got him.

14:09.055 --> 14:10.125
- Downtown.

14:10.194 --> 14:11.920
- Ah, the one Chance
lost his hat in?

14:11.989 --> 14:14.094
- This Curly Bill?
- Yes, sir.

14:14.163 --> 14:16.579
- Oh, boy, you best screw your
hat down in the morning, Jimmy.

14:51.235 --> 14:53.030
- There you go
Right there.

14:54.134 --> 14:55.273
All right. Okay.

15:00.347 --> 15:01.452
- Hey, cowboy.

15:04.351 --> 15:06.250
Could use a bath.

15:06.319 --> 15:09.218
- Yeah, he earned
one today, huh?

15:09.287 --> 15:11.807
- I ain't talking
about the horse.

15:11.876 --> 15:13.326
- Yeah, I might have
earned one too.

15:13.395 --> 15:15.155
- So about that
dinner you owe me.

15:16.536 --> 15:18.089
- That's right, I do owe you.

15:18.158 --> 15:19.573
- I sure am hungry.

15:21.127 --> 15:22.680
- Well, like you said,
I need a shower.

15:22.749 --> 15:24.371
- All right.
So, after your shower.

15:26.408 --> 15:28.928
It's a great idea, but, uh...

15:28.997 --> 15:31.033
My trailer's about a
two hour ride that way.

15:31.102 --> 15:32.414
- Wash rack right over there.

15:34.795 --> 15:35.935
- Yeah, it is.

15:38.454 --> 15:41.043
- So, I'll meet you
back here in half an hour.

16:08.450 --> 16:10.141
- Hi.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.320
Hello.

16:16.389 --> 16:18.011
- Ever been to the
café in Paducah?

16:19.392 --> 16:20.910
- No, I haven't.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.671
- Well, it's pretty good.

16:24.535 --> 16:26.502
- Well, Paducah it is,
then, huh?

16:26.571 --> 16:28.884
- Great.
- Great.

16:28.953 --> 16:31.231
Guess I'll just, uh...

16:31.300 --> 16:33.164
just finish up here, then.

16:33.233 --> 16:35.684
- Just so you know, there is
a shower in the bunkhouse.

16:35.753 --> 16:38.756
When I said wash rack
I was being coy.

16:38.825 --> 16:39.964
- Coy?

16:40.033 --> 16:41.207
- I was flirting.

16:43.278 --> 16:44.382
- Well, that's good.

16:46.074 --> 16:47.868
It's kind of hard to describe
with words

16:47.937 --> 16:49.387
how uncomfortable
I am right now.

16:49.456 --> 16:50.733
- I can imagine.

16:52.528 --> 16:53.805
I'll meet you over
at the truck.

16:54.841 --> 16:56.394
- Deal.
- Deal.

17:05.783 --> 17:07.060
Stand up! Fight back!

17:07.129 --> 17:07.992
What do we do?

17:08.061 --> 17:09.614
- Stand up, fight back!

17:09.683 --> 17:10.615
What do we do?

17:10.684 --> 17:12.238
- Stand up fight back!

17:12.307 --> 17:15.448
- When the land we want
is under attack, what do we do?

17:15.517 --> 17:17.036
- Stand up, fight back!

17:17.105 --> 17:18.037
What do we do?

17:30.911 --> 17:31.947
Stand up, fight back!

17:32.016 --> 17:33.121
What do we do?

17:33.190 --> 17:35.123
Stand up,
fight back!

17:35.192 --> 17:38.160
- When the land we want
is under attack, what do we do?

17:38.229 --> 17:39.644
- Stand up, fight back!

17:39.713 --> 17:40.611
What do we do?

17:40.680 --> 17:42.095
- Stand up, fight back!

17:42.164 --> 17:43.510
What do we do?

17:43.579 --> 17:46.065
- Hey, gotta take this whole
party back to town.

17:46.134 --> 17:48.791
Hey you,
cameraman, get down!

17:48.860 --> 17:50.793
Excuse me?

17:50.862 --> 17:52.623
- This is all private property.

17:52.692 --> 17:54.797
Lawyers have decided
it's too much liability

17:54.866 --> 17:56.075
to having you here.

17:56.144 --> 17:59.147
- Liability?
- That's right, insurance.

17:59.216 --> 18:03.047
Your cameraman could fall off

18:03.116 --> 18:04.531

18:04.600 --> 18:07.396
- Very...look...
what's your name?

18:09.122 --> 18:10.227
- Leslie.

18:10.296 --> 18:12.884
- So I'll make
you a deal, Leslie,

18:12.953 --> 18:15.163
give me your number and when
something worth filming

18:15.232 --> 18:17.372
is about to happen,
I'll give you a call.

18:17.441 --> 18:19.443
- Why would you do that?

18:19.512 --> 18:21.479
- Well, let's just say
I'm a concerned citizen.

18:26.174 --> 18:27.658
- That's my cell.

18:30.868 --> 18:34.872
You know, um... Leslie,
I wouldn't uh,

18:34.941 --> 18:37.495
wouldn't unpack the truck
if you know what I mean.

18:37.564 --> 18:39.394
- I know what you mean.

18:53.028 --> 18:57.239
- Well, I was born in Waco,
went to school in Tarleton,

18:57.308 --> 18:59.690
Vet school at A&M,

18:59.759 --> 19:02.969
then I been at the Sixes
ever since.

19:03.038 --> 19:04.039
What about you?

19:05.178 --> 19:07.663
- I, uh, wasn't much
of a student.

19:07.732 --> 19:10.942
Dropped out when I was about
fifteen after my mom died.

19:11.011 --> 19:13.324
Got in a little bit of trouble,
did a couple of turns in jail.

19:13.393 --> 19:15.913
- All right, so we're telling
the truth, the whole truth...

19:15.982 --> 19:17.397
- Yes, ma'am.

19:17.466 --> 19:20.780
- All right.
Continue.

19:20.849 --> 19:21.919
- Got hired
on at the Yellowstone

19:21.988 --> 19:23.921
as a favor to my grandfather.

19:23.990 --> 19:25.474
A favor they took back

19:25.543 --> 19:27.166
after I got tore up
pretty good by a bucking horse.

19:27.235 --> 19:29.513
So here I am.

19:29.582 --> 19:32.585
- So, you weren't a cowboy
before the Yellowstone?

19:32.654 --> 19:35.001
- Well, to be honest, I'm not
sure I'm much of a cowboy now.

19:38.073 --> 19:39.074
- Jimmy.

19:40.903 --> 19:41.904

19:41.973 --> 19:43.423

- Good.

19:43.492 --> 19:45.253

- Nice to meet you, Ma'am.

19:45.322 --> 19:47.531
- Nice to meet you.
- Ma'am, how are you?

19:47.600 --> 19:48.877
- Good, how are you?

19:48.946 --> 19:50.672

a day off, I see.

19:50.741 --> 19:52.984
- An evening off
is more like it.

19:53.053 --> 19:54.607

20:04.582 --> 20:06.964
I think that means
you're cowboy enough for him.

20:08.931 --> 20:09.932
- Yeah, maybe so.

20:28.744 --> 20:29.883
It's my first

20:29.952 --> 20:31.126
so I don't really know
the protocol.

20:33.439 --> 20:34.405

It's just supper.

24:02.199 --> 24:04.408

- There's fruit in the salad.
I don't want that.

- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm all right.

24:09.275 --> 24:12.243

No?

24:15.005 --> 24:17.663
Doctor says he needs
to eat fruit with every meal.

24:18.836 --> 24:22.322

Lots of things are good

He specializes in...
in Tantric healing.

Now that, that is good

24:46.415 --> 24:47.900
- Don't encourage her.

24:47.969 --> 24:51.110
- It focuses on
the erogenous zones.

24:51.179 --> 24:52.939
- E-what?
Erogenous zones?

24:53.008 --> 24:56.080
- Mm-hmm. Areolas, vulva,
phallus, sphincter.

24:58.393 --> 25:00.050
- Is that Latin?

25:00.119 --> 25:02.224
- And you've done this?

25:02.293 --> 25:04.123
- You're just pouring
gas on the fire, Rip.

25:07.057 --> 25:09.680

25:15.997 --> 25:17.446

- He recommends that
you see him monthly,

25:19.276 --> 25:22.451
but after my first session
with him, I was like a month?

25:22.521 --> 25:25.178
I'm seeing
your ass tomorrow.

25:25.247 --> 25:26.628
- Are we still talking
about the salad?

25:28.527 --> 25:30.390
- No, Carter.
We're well past salad.

25:32.082 --> 25:34.187
- Can I have some?

25:34.256 --> 25:36.189
- Have all you want.

25:36.258 --> 25:39.089
- That's good. Start young.
Keep those pipes clean.

cancer revenge?

25:51.722 --> 25:54.725
- I don't know.
I cannot figure it out.

25:54.794 --> 25:56.831
- Why don't you
just ask her?

25:59.074 --> 26:00.420
- Why don't you ask me, Daddy?

26:00.489 --> 26:03.631
Ask me how me being the only
one making conversation

26:03.700 --> 26:05.909
at this table
is somehow vengeful.

26:05.978 --> 26:08.394
- Every meal.
Just like this one.

26:08.463 --> 26:10.361
- Beth, you're not gonna do
this at breakfast, are you?

26:10.430 --> 26:12.329
Cause I have to eat
my breakfast quick.

26:12.398 --> 26:14.400
- What? Do what?
What am I doing?

26:14.469 --> 26:15.574
What the fuck am I doing?!

26:15.643 --> 26:18.335
You know what I'm doing?

26:18.404 --> 26:19.923
I'm fucking leaving,
that's what I'm doing.

26:25.307 --> 26:27.516
-
Excuse me, sir.

26:31.486 --> 26:33.695
Yeah, right there.

26:35.214 --> 26:37.906
On the bright side of
things, now...

26:37.975 --> 26:38.976
now I can eat this in peace.

26:42.359 --> 26:43.809
- Can I still have
cake after supper?

26:45.396 --> 26:47.295
- Hell, you can have
some right now.

26:48.986 --> 26:51.195
- Cake with steak?

26:51.264 --> 26:53.473
- Cake with your steak.

27:17.497 --> 27:20.500
- What in the fuck
was that about?

27:20.569 --> 27:22.571
What kind of
childhood bullshit

27:22.641 --> 27:24.677
are you working out
at the dinner table?

27:28.681 --> 27:31.615
- Yeah, that's
what it is, Rip.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.030
It's the table.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.346
It's that whole fucking room.

27:38.415 --> 27:41.970
It's this stifling, oppressive,
false fucking fantasy

27:42.039 --> 27:44.593
of a family that just
does not exist.

27:46.147 --> 27:48.874
Never fucking existed.

27:48.943 --> 27:50.496
Do you know there was four
different forks and spoons

27:50.565 --> 27:51.842
on that table, Rip?

27:51.911 --> 27:53.879
Four. There's an oyster spoon
on the table.

27:53.948 --> 27:55.708
Do we eat oysters?

27:55.777 --> 27:58.159
No.

27:58.228 --> 28:00.299
But by God do we have
the fucking spoon for it.

28:00.368 --> 28:02.439
- If you don't like the room,

28:02.508 --> 28:04.475
then eat in a different room.

28:04.544 --> 28:05.856
At a different
fucking table.

28:05.925 --> 28:07.202
I mean, look, there's
a table right there.

28:07.271 --> 28:08.928
Why don't we eat
right here?

28:08.997 --> 28:10.309
What do you say?

28:14.727 --> 28:17.247
- So, what's the biggest
one you've ever seen?

28:17.316 --> 28:18.697
- Six feet.

28:18.766 --> 28:21.838
- That's a big snake.
- That's a big damn snake.

28:21.907 --> 28:25.911
We were rebuilding
the horse stalls.

28:25.980 --> 28:27.498
- It was in the barn?

28:27.567 --> 28:28.568
- It was in the barn.

28:29.949 --> 28:32.503
- Did you see it?
- Oh, yeah, I saw it.

28:32.572 --> 28:35.921
- He was about your age
and when he saw it

28:35.990 --> 28:40.373
he did exactly what the rest

28:40.442 --> 28:42.030
he ran up the wall
like a damn spider

28:42.099 --> 28:43.825
and hung from the rafters.

28:43.894 --> 28:45.240
That's true.

28:45.309 --> 28:47.518
But hey, discretion
is the better part of valor

28:47.587 --> 28:49.624
and trust me, there
was a ton of valor

28:49.693 --> 28:52.282
up in them rafters,
let me tell you.

28:52.351 --> 28:53.697
- Did you kill it?

28:53.766 --> 28:54.974
- Hell, no, I didn't kill it.

28:55.043 --> 28:56.769
You know how many
mice those things eat?

28:58.944 --> 29:01.153
And I wouldn't let any
of the boys kill it either.

29:03.465 --> 29:06.537
But I had this old heeler...
do you remember him?

29:06.606 --> 29:08.505
- I do.
- You remember?

29:08.574 --> 29:09.989
- Oh, sure.

29:10.058 --> 29:11.473
- Well, he was meaner
than shit...

29:11.542 --> 29:12.647
And he was cat quick.

29:12.716 --> 29:14.856
And one day he found that snake,

29:14.925 --> 29:17.894
and oh my God, those two,
those two went at it...

29:17.963 --> 29:19.758
- What happened?

29:29.112 --> 29:31.010
- You be careful
when you open this.

29:34.738 --> 29:35.670
- Oh!

29:43.678 --> 29:45.197
- Count those rings and you'll
see how old it is.

29:45.266 --> 29:46.267
- Thank you.

29:47.475 --> 29:49.580
- Sweetie.

29:49.649 --> 29:52.135
Life is plenty hard, you don't
need to help it, you hear me?

29:53.584 --> 29:56.173
- You're saying I make
life harder?

29:56.242 --> 29:57.381
- Every day.

30:09.635 --> 30:12.465
- No, that's yours.
You keep that.

30:15.227 --> 30:17.746

30:17.816 --> 30:18.817
- Thank you.

30:28.930 --> 30:30.449
Let me see them.

30:52.643 --> 30:54.093
<i>Something wrong?</i>

30:54.162 --> 30:56.130
- I didn't know y'all had
wolves east of Big Timber.

30:56.199 --> 30:58.891
<i>There aren't.
- There's one.</i>

30:58.960 --> 31:00.444

<i>Kayce, whatever you do,
don't shoot it.</i>

31:09.695 --> 31:11.524
- If it gets near
my horses, I'm shooting it.

31:11.593 --> 31:14.182

horses, it's a test.</i>

31:14.251 --> 31:15.908

31:23.812 --> 31:25.607
- All right, buddy,
time to get out.

31:25.676 --> 31:27.609
- Close your eyes.

31:27.678 --> 31:29.128
- Close my eyes?

31:29.197 --> 31:32.131
- Well... Things down there
are not the same.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.684
- Not the same how?

31:33.753 --> 31:36.342
- Well, sometimes
it just gets stiff as a board

31:36.411 --> 31:37.930
for like no reason.

31:39.483 --> 31:42.314
- Is that happening right now?

31:42.383 --> 31:44.523
- Got any solutions?

31:44.592 --> 31:47.836
- You know, I'm gonna let your
dad handle the solutions.

32:01.264 --> 32:03.542
I think it's time you
gave Tate the talk.

32:05.337 --> 32:06.994
- What talk?

32:07.063 --> 32:08.374
- The sex talk.

32:11.343 --> 32:12.482
Your father never...

32:13.552 --> 32:15.347
Of course he didn't.

32:15.416 --> 32:18.591
Your son is sitting
in the bathtub with a...

32:18.660 --> 32:21.456
I can't even say it.
A boy issue.

32:21.525 --> 32:24.114
I need you to go in there
and talk him through

32:24.183 --> 32:25.667
how to deal with it.

32:25.736 --> 32:26.772
- Well, I'm sure he'll figure
out how to deal with that

32:26.841 --> 32:28.015
all on his own.

32:28.084 --> 32:30.396
- Kayce, he's got
to understand...

32:30.465 --> 32:33.089
You know, the...
the purpose of it.

32:33.158 --> 32:35.712
How we're all animals
and how life is created.

32:35.781 --> 32:38.818
- Baby, he grew up on a ranch.
- Oh.

32:38.887 --> 32:41.752
- He's been watching animals
screw since he was born,

32:41.821 --> 32:43.409
and then he watched
them have babies.

32:43.478 --> 32:45.756
He's helped me pull calves
and foal out horses.

32:45.825 --> 32:49.864
He knows everything
he needs to know about sex.

32:49.933 --> 32:52.936
And one day when he's sixteen,
I'll sit him down

32:53.005 --> 32:55.835
I'll tell him why he shouldn't
until he's married.

32:55.904 --> 32:58.183
-
- And he's gonna promise me...

32:58.252 --> 32:59.908
and then one Friday night
he's gonna go out

32:59.978 --> 33:02.704
and meet some girl,
they're gonna fall in love

33:02.773 --> 33:04.396
and fuck like rabbits

33:04.465 --> 33:07.261
until they break up
or she gets pregnant.

33:07.330 --> 33:09.366
Cause that's exactly
what happened to us.

33:09.435 --> 33:11.230
- Yes, I guess we
outgrew that, huh?

33:17.409 --> 33:20.136
Oh, yeah, there was something
else I forgot to mention.

33:20.205 --> 33:21.620
- Yeah?

33:21.689 --> 33:23.415
- Yeah.

33:23.484 --> 33:25.003
What was it?

33:25.934 --> 33:27.419
Oh yeah, we did it again.

33:29.317 --> 33:31.285
- What did we do?

33:31.354 --> 33:33.252
- Fucked like rabbits
'til I got pregnant.

33:35.599 --> 33:36.876
- You're pregnant?

33:47.301 --> 33:48.785
- Can your dog come
to bed with me?

33:50.407 --> 33:53.134
- She's everybody's dog, buddy.

33:53.203 --> 33:54.446
- Tell that to the dog.

33:55.585 --> 33:57.138
Why's mom crying?

33:57.207 --> 33:58.933
- Oh, I'm just happy, honey.

34:02.143 --> 34:03.282
- You're gonna be a brother.

34:04.421 --> 34:06.527
- You're having a baby?

34:06.596 --> 34:09.150
- Yeah, we sure are, honey.

34:09.219 --> 34:11.635
- I knew those weren't
naps you were taking.

34:11.704 --> 34:13.327
Ugh.

34:13.396 --> 34:15.467
You better start saving
up your money, Dad.

34:15.536 --> 34:17.469
I don't babysit for free.

34:17.538 --> 34:18.677
Come on, Sunka.

34:22.612 --> 34:24.786
- All right.
I stand corrected.

34:24.855 --> 34:27.065
He does not need the sex talk.

34:27.134 --> 34:28.583
- We sure could've
used it, though.

34:30.447 --> 34:31.414
- You're happy, right?

34:34.244 --> 34:35.314
- I'm happy.

35:21.498 --> 35:22.775
They're here.

35:24.191 --> 35:26.538
- Time to take one
for the team.

35:27.780 --> 35:28.919
- Yeah.

35:49.630 --> 35:50.631
- Hey!

35:54.221 --> 35:55.394
You have no right
to be here!

36:12.204 --> 36:13.999
- Okay.
- Get up...get up!

36:14.068 --> 36:16.484
- I'm getting up!
- Move, move!
- Okay!

36:30.843 --> 36:34.571
More than 300
protesters have been arrested

36:34.640 --> 36:35.848
as we've seen.

36:46.825 --> 36:48.792
- Okay, okay.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.019
- I thought we pulled
the news crews.

37:09.088 --> 37:11.401
- They were set up
on the road.

37:11.470 --> 37:13.990
- How did they know
to set up on the road?

37:14.059 --> 37:16.958
- Unclear.
Tipped off.

37:17.027 --> 37:19.271
Probably one of the protestors.

37:19.340 --> 37:21.963
<i>- In total, 117 protestors</i>

37:22.032 --> 37:24.725
<i>have been arrested and charged
with criminal trespassing,</i>

37:24.794 --> 37:28.142
<i>criminal mischief,
and failure to disperse.</i>

37:28.211 --> 37:30.972
<i>Three have been charged with
assault on a police officer,</i>

37:31.041 --> 37:32.871
<i>and the leader of Free Earth,</i>

37:32.940 --> 37:34.528
<i>Summer Higgins,
has been charged</i>

37:34.597 --> 37:37.945
<i>with felony aggravated assault
on a peace officer.</i>

37:38.014 --> 37:41.086
<i>She was arrested a few weeks
ago for a similar assault</i>

37:41.155 --> 37:43.502
<i>on Livestock Agents
and Sheriff's Deputies</i>

37:43.571 --> 37:45.987
<i>in an unrelated protest.</i>

37:46.056 --> 37:50.923
- Hm. Seems the narrative
is in our favor.

37:50.992 --> 37:53.650
- We need a big
news day in New York.

37:53.719 --> 37:57.033
If this goes national,
the narrative will be flipped.

38:09.908 --> 38:12.428
- Hey, Daddy.
- Morning, honey.

38:12.497 --> 38:14.395
<i>- New York Times, how may
I direct your call?</i>

38:14.464 --> 38:16.915
- Brett Eaves at
the national desk.

38:16.984 --> 38:18.606
What are you doing today?

38:18.675 --> 38:21.851
- Loading bulls. You?

38:21.920 --> 38:23.093
- Loading bullshit.

38:23.162 --> 38:24.405
<i>- This is Brett.</i>

38:24.474 --> 38:26.821
- Hey, Brett, are you aware
of the protest

38:26.890 --> 38:29.893
happening in Montana that
was broken up by Federal agents?

38:29.962 --> 38:31.964
<i>- No, protest over what?</i>

38:32.033 --> 38:35.623
- Some airport.
117 people were arrested.

38:35.692 --> 38:39.247
And I think three or four
ended up in the hospital.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.216
KNBS. Worth a watch.

38:42.285 --> 38:44.425
I think you'll see
the potential.

38:44.494 --> 38:46.324
<i>- Thanks, I'll check it out.
- More to come.</i>

38:48.464 --> 38:50.017
- What're you up to, sweetheart?

38:53.883 --> 38:55.436
What you asked, Daddy.

38:58.681 --> 39:00.199
Have a good day.

39:04.721 --> 39:05.722
- Go ahead and bring
them boys.

39:09.933 --> 39:11.521
Let them sift in there now.

39:12.729 --> 39:15.594
- Hey, bulls.
Hey, bulls.

39:15.663 --> 39:18.183
Hold up, boys, hold up, boys.
Hold up, boys.

39:18.252 --> 39:20.944
Let 'em load.
Let 'em load.

39:22.152 --> 39:23.222
- Go ahead, Teeter.

39:23.291 --> 39:25.673
- Where'd you get
the heifers?

39:25.742 --> 39:28.296
- I put them out yesterday.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.472
- Good, I don't need any
of these tearing down fences

39:31.541 --> 39:33.681
looking for a girlfriend.

39:33.750 --> 39:35.373
- You want me to drive?

39:35.442 --> 39:38.134
- Nah, I'll drive.

39:47.074 --> 39:50.008
- This should be good. Yeah?

39:50.077 --> 39:51.112
<i>We need to meet.</i>

39:51.181 --> 39:52.838
- About what, I wonder...

39:52.907 --> 39:54.909
<i>Is there a time
that works?</i>

39:54.978 --> 39:58.050
- You know where the ranch is.
Come by whenever.

39:58.119 --> 39:59.983
<i>- I'd prefer a neutral site.</i>

40:00.052 --> 40:03.331
-
The ranch is a neutral site.

40:03.401 --> 40:04.747
<i>- Not for me.</i>

40:04.816 --> 40:05.782
- Yeah, and whose fault is that?

40:07.750 --> 40:08.923
You know where to find me.

40:11.788 --> 40:14.998
After we drop these bulls we're
gonna meet the sheriff in town.

40:15.067 --> 40:16.310
- Okay.

40:19.900 --> 40:22.109
- You know, you're the only one
in my life who don't ask me

40:22.178 --> 40:23.559
why when I say
we're doing a thing.

40:23.628 --> 40:26.803
- I figure you'll tell me
why if you want me to know

40:26.872 --> 40:28.909
or I'll figure it out
when we get there.

40:28.978 --> 40:30.324
- Not calling you out
for it, Rip.

40:32.809 --> 40:34.224
I'm thanking you for it.

40:40.127 --> 40:41.715
I know who tried to kill me.

40:44.787 --> 40:47.065
- Sir, maybe the Sheriff isn't
who you should be talking to,

40:47.134 --> 40:48.998
maybe you let me
fucking handle it.

40:50.689 --> 40:52.173
- I'd like to kill
him myself, Rip.

40:52.242 --> 40:53.934
But he's sitting in prison

40:54.003 --> 40:55.487
and that's where
he's going to stay

40:55.556 --> 40:57.800
for the rest of his shitty life.

40:57.869 --> 40:59.457
We're meeting with the Sheriff
right now to figure out

40:59.526 --> 41:03.012
how we make that life
just a little shorter.

41:31.799 --> 41:33.283
- Hold it, sir.
Hold it. Hold it.

41:38.910 --> 41:40.118
Nobody's eating.

41:40.187 --> 41:41.775
They're just staring
at each other.

41:44.881 --> 41:46.193
What do you got in the truck?

41:46.262 --> 41:48.195
- Got a pistol in the glove box.

41:48.264 --> 41:49.403
Got a rifle behind the seat.

41:52.233 --> 41:54.581
Get in the truck.

42:16.810 --> 42:18.018
- They're gone.

42:24.956 --> 42:27.821
I'm gonna need wallets,
rings, watches.

42:27.890 --> 42:29.236
On the fucking table!

42:29.305 --> 42:31.169
Open it. Open it!

42:32.239 --> 42:33.343
Hands on the table!

42:33.412 --> 42:34.586
Don't you fucking move!

42:34.655 --> 42:36.795
- Eyes front.

42:36.864 --> 42:38.556
That's right. That's right.

42:41.593 --> 42:43.526
- He's back.
The cowboy's back.

42:50.498 --> 42:51.569
- Hey.

43:12.693 --> 43:13.867
- He's around the corner.

43:17.077 --> 43:19.148
You think that's gonna
save you, you fucking coward?

43:19.217 --> 43:21.426
- I'll fucking kill her, I swear
to God, I'll fucking do it!

43:21.495 --> 43:22.496
- That's right, then
you won't have anybody

43:22.565 --> 43:23.531
to hide behind, will you?

43:24.981 --> 43:27.018
Party's almost over.

43:27.087 --> 43:28.295
You see it?

43:28.364 --> 43:30.090
- I got it.

43:30.159 --> 43:31.125
- Whenever you want.

43:33.196 --> 43:34.266
- Ah!

43:44.863 --> 43:47.279
- Trying to...
Call my daughter, John.

43:47.348 --> 43:50.144
- Okay.

43:51.870 --> 43:54.804
Hey, there you are.

43:54.873 --> 43:56.461
<i>- Hey, Dad,
can I call you later?</i>

43:56.530 --> 43:57.876
<i>I got the kids crawling all
over me--</i>

43:57.945 --> 43:59.084
- Honey, no. I'm...

43:59.153 --> 44:02.950
I'm not that sure you can.

44:03.019 --> 44:04.020
<i>- What?</i>

44:05.056 --> 44:06.816
<i>Dad?</i>

44:09.094 --> 44:10.095
<i>Dad?</i>

44:13.305 --> 44:17.758
- Debbie, this is John Dutton.

44:17.827 --> 44:19.622
<i>- Is everything okay?</i>

44:19.691 --> 44:22.038
- No, honey.
Everything's not okay.
