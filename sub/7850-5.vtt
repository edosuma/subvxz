00:09.109 --> 00:11.111
Now, Cody's our senior bag boy.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.312
You can learn a lot from him.

I'll have the last laugh when you're 16

Speaking of which, you know, Wayne,

00:28.828 --> 00:32.532
we forgot to put Zack
through the initiation ritual.

00:32.599 --> 00:34.434
Oh, that's right.

00:34.834 --> 00:38.772
New employees have to drink
prune juice mixed with fish oil.

00:39.439 --> 00:41.474
-I'm not doing that.
-Okay.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.077
But you made me do it.

00:44.144 --> 00:46.312
You said it was an established tradition.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.982
Well, yeah. I've been trying
to establish it for years.

We'll be staying at the Barrington Resort
at Barrington Mountain in Barringtonia.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.107
Because you don't have a boyfriend.

you wouldn't like my friends.
