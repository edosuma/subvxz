shining in the morning fog.

give you valentines?

13:52.265 --> 13:53.164
Oh, yes.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.166
He never forgets
a Valentine's.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.168
You know, he's just
a romantic at heart.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.638
Sometimes forgets a birthday,
which I'm beginning to not mind,

14:00.740 --> 14:03.300
and our anniversary on occasion,

14:03.409 --> 14:06.037
which I will never get over,

14:06.145 --> 14:08.045
but never a Valentine's Day.

14:08.147 --> 14:11.049
- Always brings me flowers.
- Mm...

14:11.150 --> 14:12.243
Well... (chuckles)

14:12.352 --> 14:14.946
it's nice he remembers.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.559
Happy Valentine's Day,
sweetheart.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.561
Oh, Howard! Flowers!

14:23.663 --> 14:24.721
Mm-hmm.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.662
- How thoughtful.
- Mm!

14:26.766 --> 14:30.930
Just like the ones you gave me
on our first Valentine's.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.596
- Yeah.
- Remember?

14:32.705 --> 14:33.934
Oh, do I.

14:34.040 --> 14:37.100
We had dinner at that cozy
little Italian restaurant.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.768
It was Armenian.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.710
Oh, that's right.

14:40.813 --> 14:43.373
Yeah, I remember. I didn't have
enough money for the tip,

14:43.483 --> 14:46.247
and the waiter chased me out
with a flaming shish kebab.

14:46.352 --> 14:50.084
(chuckles)

Oh.
(chuckles)

17:06.559 --> 17:10.051
I-I was just thinking about
romance and Valentine's Day

17:10.162 --> 17:13.223
and how happy it makes
other people.

17:13.332 --> 17:17.326
Happy Valentine's Day,
sweetheart.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.703
Oh. Oh, dear.

17:22.808 --> 17:24.867
Is it your back again?

17:24.977 --> 17:29.676
Yeah. I tried to lift a box
of putty knives.

17:29.782 --> 17:33.116
Well, <i>l-I'll</i> just call the
Reillys and tell them that...

17:33.219 --> 17:34.448
that we can't make
their dinner party.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.216
No, no, no, it's all right.
We'll go.

17:37.323 --> 17:40.418
But let one person crack a joke
about Quasimodo

17:40.526 --> 17:41.823
and I'm leaving.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.828
We better get started.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.660
It'll take me 20 minutes
to get back to the car.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.166
- Good-bye, Mom and Dad.
- Good night, sweetheart.

17:49.268 --> 17:51.760
You sure that you can drive?

17:51.871 --> 17:53.703
I can drive, Marion.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.503
I just can't see the road,
that's all.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.509
Oh, I can't believe it.

17:58.611 --> 17:59.976
Kicked out
of a French restaurant

18:00.079 --> 18:01.638
because I have no tie.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.977
Now, where was I supposed
to wear it? On my nose?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.518
- Hi, Joanie.
- Hi, Joanie.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.143
And you know what really
irks me?

18:08.254 --> 18:09.847
It was my idea to go
to a French restaurant,

18:09.956 --> 18:11.355
and now it's Potsie and Ralph
who are sitting there

18:11.457 --> 18:12.618
eating all that great food.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.784
A tie, a tie--
what's the big deal about a tie?

18:14.894 --> 18:17.124
- You were the one that said they
should stay. -Oh, yeah, sure.

18:17.229 --> 18:20.131
Of course it was me.
It's always me. Mr. Nice Guy.

18:20.232 --> 18:22.064
Come on. Never mind.
Go up and change.

18:22.168 --> 18:24.830
- Then we'll go back to my place
and I'll change... -No.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.235
No, it took me all day
to get used to this sweater,

18:27.340 --> 18:28.773
and we're going out to dinner.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.706
And we're going out to dinner
on our own terms.

18:30.810 --> 18:31.834
Come on, woman.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.175
I love it when he takes charge.

18:36.215 --> 18:38.115
Bye.

18:38.217 --> 18:40.515
-(door shuts)
- French restaurant.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.315
Sure knows how to treat a girl.

18:42.421 --> 18:44.788
LORI BETH:

18:44.890 --> 18:46.791

19:54.860 --> 19:56.988

20:36.302 --> 20:39.294

20:45.044 --> 20:47.035
(knocking on door)

20:48.047 --> 20:50.038
(knocking continues)

20:56.422 --> 20:57.651
Who is it?

20:57.757 --> 20:59.281
It's me! Binky!

20:59.391 --> 21:00.654
You made it! You're here!

21:00.760 --> 21:02.751
Oh... don't touch me.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.955
Fine day to get a job.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.964
- But I had to.
- Oh.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.159
So I could get you this.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.430
For me?

21:11.537 --> 21:13.437
Really?
(chuckles)

21:13.539 --> 21:15.439
I'll open it up.

21:15.541 --> 21:17.509
(chuckles)
Okay.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.635
(gasps)

21:19.745 --> 21:22.214
Oh, it's beautiful!

21:22.314 --> 21:23.873
Beautiful. I really...

21:23.983 --> 21:26.008
All I got you was a card.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.018
Oh! That's all I want.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.645
Just so long as it's from you.

21:29.755 --> 21:31.985
Okay. Um...

21:32.091 --> 21:33.991
it's a little wrinkled.

21:34.093 --> 21:36.926
- I like wrinkles.
- Oh. (chuckles)

21:37.029 --> 21:39.965
Aw, and it's signed
"Love, Joanie." Do you mean it?

21:40.065 --> 21:42.899
Yeah, I think so.
(chuckles) Yeah.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.493
Listen, I know it's too late
to go to, uh...

21:45.604 --> 21:48.506
to Arnold's for the dance, but I
know a place that's still open.

21:48.607 --> 21:50.473
Inspiration Point?

21:50.576 --> 21:51.805
I'll think about it.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.401
<i>.Ol(3y-

21:57.650 --> 22:02.144
Howard, Jerry Helper was not
doing a Quasimodo joke.

22:02.254 --> 22:03.813
Marion,

22:03.923 --> 22:07.916
that man asked me
to swing from the dinner bell.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.692
I'll never straighten up!

22:11.797 --> 22:13.629
Look on the bright side, dear.

22:13.732 --> 22:17.225
In the driveway, you found
three quarters and a bus token.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.271
But I couldn't pick 'em up.

22:20.372 --> 22:22.602
I'll make it up to you
next year, sweetheart.

22:22.708 --> 22:23.607
Don't worry.

22:23.709 --> 22:25.268
Now, you just relax.

22:25.377 --> 22:28.142
- Eh. -I'm gonna go upstairs
and take a nice warm bath

22:28.247 --> 22:30.477
and put on
some valentine perfume,

22:30.583 --> 22:33.484
slip into something comfortable.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.747
Daring.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.846
Frisky!

22:43.128 --> 22:45.120
Frisky?
