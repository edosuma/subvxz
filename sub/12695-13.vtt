WEBVTT

00:17.100 --> 00:19.100
- We're gonna watch
a movie.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.200
- Not on that couch.
Oyster, launch mode!

00:21.200 --> 00:22.633
- What's launch--

00:24.767 --> 00:26.033
- Whoa!

00:26.033 --> 00:28.367
- You could've just
called dibs.

00:28.367 --> 00:31.733
- Looks like you girls are gonna
have to watch TV somewhere else.

00:31.733 --> 00:34.500
- You boys may have the couch,
but we have the remote.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.333
Keep the remote.
We're out of here.

00:37.333 --> 00:39.700
My friends do not want to hang
out with your friends.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.767
ALL:
Shhhh!

00:41.767 --> 00:44.333
MALE ANNOUNCER ON TV: From the
makers of Werewolf Hurricane

00:44.333 --> 00:46.033
and Vampire Twister

00:46.033 --> 00:49.833
comes a supernatural storm
that no one could forecast--

00:49.833 --> 00:52.467
Zombie Rain 3-D.

00:52.467 --> 00:55.333
ALL: Whoa!

00:55.333 --> 00:57.433
- I so want to see that.
- Me too.

00:57.433 --> 00:59.367
Some girl we go
to school with saw it,

00:59.367 --> 01:02.800
and she's had
nightmares ever since.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.633
- Uh, that was me.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.500
- Hey, we should
all go tonight.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.067
- Oh, sweetches!
- Not sweetches.

01:10.067 --> 01:12.433
Phoebe, I've seen the movie.
I've seen your friends.

01:12.433 --> 01:14.567
I'm not a fan of either.

01:14.567 --> 01:17.533
Trust me--none
of you guys should go.

01:17.533 --> 01:21.067
Some girl got pink eye
from the 3-D glasses.

01:22.067 --> 01:24.667
Yes, that was also me.

01:24.667 --> 01:28.433
- Hey, there's a 7:00 showing.
- That's perfect.

01:28.433 --> 01:31.100
I have an early cricket
match tomorrow.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.633
You heard me.

01:35.433 --> 01:36.800
W-we can't have our friends

01:36.800 --> 01:38.100
hanging out together.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.500
We already share
everything else--

01:39.500 --> 01:41.700
a couch, a house,
a family, a birthday.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.067
You're everywhere.

01:43.067 --> 01:44.633
- It's just a movie.

01:44.633 --> 01:47.367
- No, today it's movie,
but then we become a group.

01:47.367 --> 01:48.900
Next thing you know,
we're finding out

01:48.900 --> 01:52.067
who has the longest arm,
so we can take a group selfie.

01:53.300 --> 01:55.267
- It's always me.

01:55.267 --> 01:57.433
- Is that what you want,
Phoebe--

01:57.433 --> 02:01.067
for you and I to be part
of the same group forever?

02:04.067 --> 02:05.800
*

02:08.433 --> 02:11.067
- B-12.
- Bingo!

02:11.067 --> 02:12.233
Sweetches.

02:14.867 --> 02:19.633
- Hey, Long Arms, get over here
and take a group selfie.

02:19.633 --> 02:21.233
*

02:21.233 --> 02:22.967
- This has to stop!

02:22.967 --> 02:25.133
Now we're even
sharing nightmares.

02:29.633 --> 02:31.067
WOMAN:
* What you see

02:31.067 --> 02:32.667
* Is not what you get

02:32.667 --> 02:35.800
MAN: * Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:35.800 --> 02:38.867
WOMAN: * We fit right in,
bet you never guessed *

02:38.867 --> 02:40.667
MAN: * 'Cause we're livin'
our lives *

02:40.667 --> 02:42.500
* Just like all the rest

02:42.500 --> 02:44.333
BOTH:
* A picture-perfect family

02:44.333 --> 02:46.100
* Is what we try to be

02:46.100 --> 02:47.900
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:47.900 --> 02:49.233
* The crazy things we do

02:49.233 --> 02:51.067
* This isn't make-believe *

02:51.067 --> 02:52.200
* It's our reality *

02:52.200 --> 02:53.867
* Just your average family

02:53.867 --> 02:57.333
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:57.333 --> 03:00.233
* Livin' a double life *

03:00.233 --> 03:01.467
*

03:05.067 --> 03:08.067
- And now, riding
a bike with no brakes

03:08.067 --> 03:09.533
and loose handlebars,

03:09.533 --> 03:12.933
Billy Thunderman!

03:12.933 --> 03:14.533
Whoo! Yeah!

03:14.533 --> 03:15.933
- Thank you.

03:15.933 --> 03:17.967
Watch, as I attempt to--

03:17.967 --> 03:21.067
BARB: Not go
to the emergency room.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.500
- Step away from
the bike, Billy.

03:28.367 --> 03:30.067
- That would have been
so much cooler

03:30.067 --> 03:32.367
if you were on it.

03:32.367 --> 03:33.367
- I know!

03:33.367 --> 03:35.433
We never get to do anything.

03:35.433 --> 03:37.200
- And you're alive.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.100
You're welcome.

03:40.333 --> 03:44.267
- Come on, maybe there's
a can we can kick outside.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.067
- Be careful.

03:48.533 --> 03:50.867
Ready to go the movies

03:50.867 --> 03:53.067
and make sure our friends
don't become friends?

03:53.067 --> 03:54.867
- Hey, don't call them
"our friends."

03:54.867 --> 03:57.833
I have my friends, and you have
your giggle buddies.

03:57.833 --> 03:59.233
- Bye, Mom.
Bye, Dad.

03:59.233 --> 04:02.467
- Hey, haven't you
forgotten something?

04:02.467 --> 04:05.600
- Uh, wallet, keys, phone,
my boyish charm.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.833
Nope, let's go.

04:06.833 --> 04:09.500
- Guys, you're not
going anywhere.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.767
- It's our date night,
remember?

04:10.767 --> 04:12.967
You two are babysitting
Billy and Nora.

04:12.967 --> 04:14.433
Why?

04:14.433 --> 04:17.633
Well, I know why.
But why?

04:17.633 --> 04:19.133
- See ya later.

04:19.133 --> 04:20.333
- Wait, do you realize

04:20.333 --> 04:21.433
that if we babysit tonight,

04:21.433 --> 04:23.267
our social lives could be over?

04:23.267 --> 04:25.067
- Better yours than ours.

04:25.067 --> 04:26.267
Run, Barb!

04:26.267 --> 04:27.733
- Be careful!

04:31.067 --> 04:34.367
- Hey, Max, can we go play
tag with your rocket

04:34.367 --> 04:35.900
on the old wooden bridge?

04:37.200 --> 04:39.267
- Sure, why don't
you hitchhike there

04:39.267 --> 04:40.667
and get a tattoo
on the way back?

04:40.667 --> 04:42.267
- Yes!
- Yes!

04:42.267 --> 04:43.567
- No!

04:43.567 --> 04:45.667
Stop fooling around.

04:45.667 --> 04:49.067
- Someone's starting
to sound a lot like Mom.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.867
Am I?

04:54.067 --> 04:55.767
- Max, how can we stop
our friends

04:55.767 --> 04:57.833
from becoming a group
if we're stuck here?

04:57.833 --> 04:59.600
- Look, I texted Cherry,
"Ditch the boys,"

04:59.600 --> 05:01.133
but it got auto-corrected.

05:01.133 --> 05:03.833
- "Stitch the bosses."

05:03.833 --> 05:05.833
That makes no sense.

05:05.833 --> 05:07.333
- You know what makes
even less sense?

05:07.333 --> 05:10.300
Cherry texted back
"Done-zo."

05:10.300 --> 05:13.333
- Well, while you've been
texting gibberish,

05:13.333 --> 05:15.333
I've been working on...

05:15.333 --> 05:17.200
this.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.400
First, I'll take over
two satellites,

05:19.400 --> 05:22.067
then disrupt
their communication

05:22.067 --> 05:24.067
so they'll lose each
other's phone numbers.

05:24.067 --> 05:25.267
Ah?

05:25.267 --> 05:26.567
- But can't they just ask

05:26.567 --> 05:27.900
for each other's
phone numbers again?

05:27.900 --> 05:30.133
- She's right, dummy.

05:30.133 --> 05:32.233
- One more word, Colosso,
I'll freeze you.

05:32.233 --> 05:33.233
- Shutting up, sir.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.333
- Wait.

05:35.333 --> 05:36.467
Max, that's it.

05:36.467 --> 05:37.500
If we freeze the kids,

05:37.500 --> 05:38.633
we can leave them here

05:38.633 --> 05:40.267
while we go separate
our friends.

05:40.267 --> 05:41.367
- Oh...

05:41.367 --> 05:42.667
that's what a not-stupid idea

05:42.667 --> 05:43.967
sounds like.

05:43.967 --> 05:44.933
- Ah.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.200
- Shutting up again.

05:49.133 --> 05:51.133
- Hey, Billy, Nora.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.700
Frozen kids say what?

05:56.867 --> 05:57.700
- Aw.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.267
I know it was my idea,

05:59.267 --> 06:01.900
but I feel kind of bad
leaving them on ice.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.300
- Now you're starting
to sound like Mom.

06:06.267 --> 06:08.067
Am I?

06:11.400 --> 06:12.900
Hey, everyone.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.500
Yay, you changed your minds.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.733
- Actually, girls,
I was thinking

06:16.733 --> 06:18.067
it would be so much more fun

06:18.067 --> 06:19.567
if we went to Wong's
to get a pizza.

06:19.567 --> 06:20.900
- That sounds awesome.
- Great.

06:20.900 --> 06:23.067
- With the boys,
after the movie.

06:24.367 --> 06:25.867
- Wouldn't you guys
rather go check out

06:25.867 --> 06:27.633
that new go

06:27.633 --> 06:29.500
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Cool.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.067
- With the girls,
tomorrow night.

06:32.167 --> 06:33.800
- I'm free.
Let's all go.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.967
We're turning into a fun group.

06:37.733 --> 06:39.567
Hands in.

06:39.567 --> 06:42.233
- I'm not doing that.

06:42.233 --> 06:45.233
- Go, group!

06:45.233 --> 06:46.200
- Okay, that looked fun.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.967
Put me down for the next one.

06:47.967 --> 06:49.800
- Hey, our movie's gonna start.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.267
See you at Wong's.

06:51.267 --> 06:53.300
- Stitch it up, bosses!

06:55.733 --> 06:57.633
- You've given the group

06:57.633 --> 07:00.267
we're trying to break up
a catchphrase.

07:00.267 --> 07:03.867
- We got to go unstitch
those bosses.

07:03.867 --> 07:05.200
- Let's get in that movie,

07:05.200 --> 07:07.300
and make them never
want to hang out again.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.967
Hands in.

07:08.967 --> 07:12.267
Go buy some tickets!

07:17.800 --> 07:21.167
- Nobody puts Nora
in the freezer.

07:23.433 --> 07:24.933
- Whoa.
What happened?

07:24.933 --> 07:27.600
Why is my butt so cold?

07:28.633 --> 07:32.167
Ow!
Why is my butt so hot?

07:32.167 --> 07:34.667
- I wonder how long
we were frozen?

07:34.667 --> 07:37.733
- For 50 years!

07:37.733 --> 07:40.300
While rabbits were once
your mere pets,

07:40.300 --> 07:45.067
here in the future,
we rule the planet!

07:45.067 --> 07:46.967
- Come on, Colosso,
we know that's one

07:46.967 --> 07:48.700
of your silly costumes.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.367
Right, Billy?

07:50.367 --> 07:53.067
- I am your humble servant.

07:53.067 --> 07:54.300
- Yes.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.600
- Tell me where
Phoebe and Max went...

07:58.200 --> 08:00.067
Or your costumes get it!

08:00.967 --> 08:04.067
- Ah, well played, girl Billy.

08:04.067 --> 08:07.433
- It's Nora.
- Don't care.

08:07.433 --> 08:10.300
Phoebe and Max froze you
so they could go to the movies.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.900
- You realize
what this means, Billy?

08:12.900 --> 08:15.300
- You know I don't, Nora.

08:15.300 --> 08:18.067
- We're home alone
for the first time!

08:18.067 --> 08:21.167
We can do whatever we want.

08:22.233 --> 08:23.767
- Light her up!

08:25.267 --> 08:27.967
- Whoo-hoo!

08:27.967 --> 08:30.700
- Take that, old wooden bridge!

08:33.200 --> 08:36.433
Oh, that's right.
You're not here.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.367
Couch party!

08:41.367 --> 08:46.433
*

08:50.200 --> 08:52.200
- Oh, there they are,
in the middle.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.700
- Look at them all--
being friends.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.500
It makes me sick
to my stomach.

09:00.567 --> 09:02.467
*

09:02.467 --> 09:05.967
Okay, let the ruining
of the night begin.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.500
- Oyster.

09:12.500 --> 09:13.600
- Sorry, guys.

09:13.600 --> 09:14.933
My fingers are just so ripped

09:14.933 --> 09:17.233
from wailing on my guitar.

09:18.467 --> 09:19.800
- Look at us--

09:19.800 --> 09:23.100
it's like we're covered
in zombie guts.

09:23.100 --> 09:25.900
[all imitating
zombies groaning]

09:25.900 --> 09:27.567
- Uh-oh, they're bonding.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.467
And now they're taking
a zombie selfie.

09:31.667 --> 09:33.467
- Aw, I couldn't get us all.

09:33.467 --> 09:35.100
My arms are too short.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.900
I wish Phoebe was here.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.267
All right, Max,
we need a new plan.

09:40.267 --> 09:42.267
If we don't get home soon,
Mom and Dad are gonna find out

09:42.267 --> 09:43.767
what we did to Billy and Nora.

09:43.767 --> 09:44.767
- Relax, Phoebe.

09:44.767 --> 09:45.767
Mom and Dad are the least

09:45.767 --> 09:47.400
of our problems right now.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.567
- See, Hank,
we missed the beginning.

09:50.567 --> 09:53.467
- You know how I feel
about paying for parking, Barb.

09:54.933 --> 09:56.267
- Any chance there's
another cheap Hank

09:56.267 --> 09:58.733
and complaining Barb
in Hiddenville?

10:00.267 --> 10:01.400
- Oh!

10:01.400 --> 10:04.067
This movie just got
way scarier.

10:12.833 --> 10:14.300
- Max, what are
we gonna do?

10:14.300 --> 10:15.833
How can we ruin
our friends' night

10:15.833 --> 10:18.000
if our parents are sitting
right behind us?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.800
- If they see us,
we won't need friends

10:19.800 --> 10:22.700
'cause we'll be grounded for
life for leaving Billy and Nora.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.967
- How can this night
get any worse?

10:24.967 --> 10:26.367
- Ah...

10:26.367 --> 10:28.867
Date night.

10:28.867 --> 10:30.300
- That's it.
I'm out.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.833
MAX:
Sorry, excuse us.

10:33.833 --> 10:36.500
Pardon me.
Sorry about that.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.633
Oh.

10:38.833 --> 10:41.200
Sorry.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.367
Ugh, people are so gross--
throwing their trash everywhere.

10:44.367 --> 10:45.967
- Tell me about it.

10:52.133 --> 10:53.667
Well, we tried.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.233
- Maybe we're overreacting.

10:55.233 --> 10:57.267
I mean, how close
can our friends really get

10:57.267 --> 10:58.333
during one movie?

11:00.600 --> 11:03.667
- Uh-oh, Gideon just asked
the girls to join your band.

11:03.667 --> 11:07.500
Please. Oyster would
never let that happen.

11:10.433 --> 11:13.567
- "Dude, the girls
are in the band"?

11:13.567 --> 11:15.067
This is horrible.

11:15.067 --> 11:16.567
I know.

11:16.567 --> 11:17.567
They didn't ask me.

11:18.733 --> 11:19.733
Oh, yay, I'm in, too.

11:20.967 --> 11:22.900
- Phoebe, nobody's in.

11:22.900 --> 11:25.100
Don't you realize
what that would mean?

11:25.100 --> 11:27.267
Our group would be in a band...

11:27.267 --> 11:28.500
together...

11:28.500 --> 11:30.433
forever.

11:33.400 --> 11:37.267
- Oh, sweetches band
practice, dudes.

11:37.267 --> 11:41.200
- Now it's time
to stitch it up, bosses.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.767
- So we're staying and breaking
up that group, right?

11:52.767 --> 11:54.267
- Oh, yeah.

11:54.267 --> 11:55.733
I'd rather get grounded
by Mom and Dad

11:55.733 --> 11:56.733
than spend the rest of my life

11:56.733 --> 11:58.700
rocking to the oldies with you.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.133
- But we won't get grounded

12:02.133 --> 12:05.933
if we don't go back
into the theater, huh?

12:07.533 --> 12:10.067
- This would go a lost faster
if you just told me your plan.

12:10.067 --> 12:11.333
- Just follow me.

12:13.267 --> 12:15.800
- Dad's gonna love
this new layout.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.933
It just makes sense.

12:24.633 --> 12:26.333
- Billy!

12:26.333 --> 12:29.133
- Sorry. I can't score
against this guy!

12:32.200 --> 12:34.133
- I was gonna say, "Nice shot."

12:34.133 --> 12:37.733
You broke some stuff and found
Mom's magic money card.

12:37.733 --> 12:40.133
- We can buy anything we want.

12:40.133 --> 12:43.067
- Let's turn Max's lair
into a ball pit.

12:43.067 --> 12:44.433
- But how do we trick some adult

12:44.433 --> 12:47.300
into letting us use
Mom's credit card?

12:47.300 --> 12:49.267
- Sign here,
Mrs. Thunderman.

12:52.833 --> 12:56.100
- Please, call me Barb...

12:56.100 --> 12:58.433
because that's my name.

13:01.233 --> 13:02.667
Oh.

13:02.667 --> 13:06.600
You're probably wondering
about my third arm.

13:07.867 --> 13:09.267
- Not if you tip me.

13:09.267 --> 13:10.500
- Oh.

13:17.067 --> 13:20.067
- He doesn't suspect a thing.

13:25.867 --> 13:27.367
- Stand back, Phoebe.

13:27.367 --> 13:30.500
I'm gonna break down
this projection room door.

13:33.967 --> 13:35.933
Whoa!

13:38.500 --> 13:40.833
- Oh, look, the door
was unlocked.

13:42.567 --> 13:44.500
- Okay.

13:46.133 --> 13:47.533
We're gonna switch out
Zombie Rain 3-D

13:47.533 --> 13:49.100
for a movie
that's even lamer--

13:49.100 --> 13:50.600
so lame,
they'll want to leave.

13:50.600 --> 13:51.833
- Got it.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.100
Um...

13:54.100 --> 13:55.833
Oh, here, how about this?

and his mom's a pilot.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.767
I'm talking about...

14:05.767 --> 14:07.500
this movie.

14:10.967 --> 14:13.067
- "Yawnimals--
a delightful documentary

14:13.067 --> 14:15.933
about the yawning habits
of the animal kingdom."

14:15.933 --> 14:17.633
Yeah.

switch the movie?

14:30.433 --> 14:33.867

to see yawning animals.

14:33.867 --> 14:36.467
- Oh, Yawnimals.

14:36.467 --> 14:38.067
Now I get it.

Hank?

to each other again.

15:28.167 --> 15:29.500
I know someone's in there.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.600
I want to see the rest
of Zombie Rain.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.700
- Uh, the scientists
create a drought,

15:34.700 --> 15:35.833
and the zombies dry up.

15:35.833 --> 15:37.433
The end.

15:37.433 --> 15:39.167
BARB: Great.
You ruined the ending.

15:39.167 --> 15:40.700
I may as well go home.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.700
- No, you can't go home!

15:42.700 --> 15:43.733
I mean...

15:43.733 --> 15:45.067
give Yawnimals a chance.

15:45.067 --> 15:47.733
It's from the makers
of Catnaps.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.300
We've got to get out of here.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.167

the only way out.

You jump first so I have
someone to break my fall.

You spoiled the movie for me.

Open this door,
or I'll open it myself.

16:27.567 --> 16:30.200
if the whole house
was filled with balls?

when we can just do it?

You even pretended
to bite my ankles.

16:56.967 --> 16:58.867
Yeah, pretended.

16:58.867 --> 17:02.567
You might want to pretend
to go get a rabies shot.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.600
She'll do anything
to not go home.

17:27.600 --> 17:30.267
- Here's an idea.
Do something!

17:32.800 --> 17:34.233
- I found some butter.

17:34.233 --> 17:35.800
- Do something else!

17:37.133 --> 17:39.500
- Don't worry.
It'll work...

17:39.500 --> 17:40.767
maybe.

17:40.767 --> 17:42.833
I've just got to make
you slippery.

Okay, try now.

Where's my wife?

18:45.200 --> 18:48.533
Why are they still here?

18:48.533 --> 18:50.133

the worst night ever,

18:50.133 --> 18:52.333
and they still won't
stop hanging out together.

18:52.333 --> 18:54.700
- Maybe it's time
we do the right thing.

18:54.700 --> 18:58.300
Ditch these losers
and get new friends.

18:58.300 --> 18:59.533

18:59.533 --> 19:01.133

was already melted

to leave the theater.

Wait here until I get
your husband, ma'am.

just call me "ma'am."

the weirdest night ever,

19:24.500 --> 19:26.067
but it was great fun.

19:26.067 --> 19:28.600
- You know what would have made
this night even better?

19:28.600 --> 19:30.767
- If you would have let me
hold your hand?

19:30.767 --> 19:32.600
- Are you talking
to me or Cherry?

19:32.600 --> 19:34.733
- I've got two hands.

19:36.067 --> 19:38.600
- No, I'm talking
about Phoebe and Max.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.167

when they fight.

the end of the world

doing back there?

20:16.100 --> 20:19.100

about going to Wong's,

20:19.100 --> 20:21.100

20:21.100 --> 20:23.733

to get out on our own

for a while...

21:01.700 --> 21:03.167

21:03.167 --> 21:05.467
But it's funny when they fight.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.867
Come on, Max.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.833
Mom and Dad
are gonna be here any second.
