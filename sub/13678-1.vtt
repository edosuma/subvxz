00:01.252 --> 00:04.589
What is it
about society that
disappoints you so much?

00:08.593 --> 00:11.179
<i>Sometimes I dream
of saving the world.</i>

00:11.262 --> 00:13.598
<i>Saving everyone from
the invisible hand.</i>

00:13.682 --> 00:16.810
<i>The one that controls
us every day without
us knowing it.</i>

00:16.935 --> 00:18.478
What if
this all went away?

00:18.603 --> 00:21.356
The city. The money.
All of it.

00:21.439 --> 00:22.941
Hey, kiddo.

00:23.608 --> 00:25.402
Exciting time in
the world right now.

00:25.485 --> 00:26.695
Exciting time.

00:26.778 --> 00:28.279
<i>Tell me about your father.</i>

00:28.363 --> 00:30.699
<i>He had leukemia.
Made me swear to
never tell anyone.</i>

00:30.782 --> 00:33.159
Finally, I got so worried,
I told my mom.

00:33.284 --> 00:35.203
I tried to hug him,
tell him I'm sorry,

00:35.286 --> 00:38.248
shoved me so hard,
I fell backwards
out the window.

00:38.331 --> 00:40.166
<i>I was eight years old.</i>

00:40.291 --> 00:42.836
If you don't take this deal,
you'll become like me.

00:42.961 --> 00:44.796
<i>Losing everyone's respect...</i>

00:44.879 --> 00:46.923
I gave up everything
for this case.

00:47.006 --> 00:48.049
I don't want you to.

00:48.133 --> 00:50.510
I'm not working there.
They killed my mother.

00:51.511 --> 00:53.221
<i>If you want
to change things,</i>

00:53.304 --> 00:56.182
<i>perhaps you should
try from within.</i>

00:56.433 --> 00:57.434
That would erase...

00:57.517 --> 00:59.185
All the debt we owe them.

00:59.310 --> 01:03.523
Every record of
every credit card, loan, and
mortgage would be wiped clean.

01:03.648 --> 01:05.358
What do we all do now?

01:05.483 --> 01:08.069
Guys! This isn't about
what we'll do tomorrow.

01:08.153 --> 01:09.654
<i>This is about what we did.</i>

01:09.738 --> 01:12.073
They're free because of us.

01:12.157 --> 01:13.658
Jesus.
What did I do?

01:13.742 --> 01:15.493
I told you we shouldn't
have done this.

01:16.202 --> 01:17.620
<i>I'm a little
concerned for Tyrell.</i>

01:17.704 --> 01:22.000
Because he was acting
very strange last I saw him.

01:22.500 --> 01:23.793
I know you're behind it.

01:23.877 --> 01:28.465
Fsociety. The server.
Colby. Allsafe.

01:28.548 --> 01:31.050
<i>You're the one constant
in a sea of variables.</i>

01:31.176 --> 01:33.928
<i>No matter what
anyone tries to do,
I will never leave you.</i>

01:34.012 --> 01:36.222
<i>I will always be right here.
Do you understand that?</i>

01:36.347 --> 01:37.766
They're gonna try and
get rid of me again,

01:37.849 --> 01:39.434
and I need you
to not let them.

01:39.517 --> 01:41.603
<i>Listen to me.
I will never leave you.</i>

01:41.853 --> 01:43.855
<i>I will never
leave you alone again.</i>

01:48.193 --> 01:49.861
<i>I am Mr. Robot.</i>

01:51.279 --> 01:53.865
I've always told you
we'd end up working
together, Elliot.

01:54.199 --> 01:55.533
But still,

01:55.867 --> 01:57.285
I have to know.

01:57.702 --> 01:59.078
Why did you do it?

02:04.709 --> 02:06.252
I wanted to save the world.

02:26.231 --> 02:27.732
Why this mask?

02:28.566 --> 02:30.151
It's a bit silly,
isn't it?

02:37.826 --> 02:39.118
Wellick.

02:41.079 --> 02:42.413
I see.

02:45.250 --> 02:46.501
I understand.

02:47.252 --> 02:50.129
James... Yes.

02:51.673 --> 02:54.342
Yes, I'm aware of
Mr. Goddard's request,

02:54.425 --> 02:56.094
but it needs to be
removed this moment.

02:57.512 --> 02:58.847
Can you escalate it?

03:02.141 --> 03:03.768
Thank you, James.

03:23.204 --> 03:24.455
It should be ready.

03:39.721 --> 03:41.306
What is it?

03:43.725 --> 03:45.143
It's happening.

04:05.663 --> 04:09.000
It's almost
as if...

04:10.668 --> 04:12.170
Something's
come alive.

04:35.860 --> 04:37.278
- Oh, my God.
- This is your fault!

04:37.362 --> 04:39.197
- It's your fault!
- I'm sorry!

04:40.531 --> 04:42.158
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry!

04:42.241 --> 04:43.534
What did you do,
you son of a bitch?

04:43.618 --> 04:45.203
- He's bleeding!
- It was an accident.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.080
God says there
are no accidents!

04:47.205 --> 04:48.164
Son, son,
please talk to me.

04:48.289 --> 04:49.707
Talk to me, please.
God help us,
he's bleeding.

04:49.791 --> 04:50.792
Oh, my God.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.418
Son, son, wake up.
Wake up!

04:52.543 --> 04:54.879
God, is he okay?
Ask if he's okay!

04:54.963 --> 04:56.464
Can't you see
he's not responding, Magda?

04:56.547 --> 04:58.299
<i>- It was your fault.</i>
<i>- It was an accident.</i>

04:58.383 --> 04:59.842
<i>God says there
are no accidents.</i>

04:59.926 --> 05:01.719
<i>Please call an ambulance!</i>

05:01.803 --> 05:03.638
<i>Call an ambulance!</i>

05:11.729 --> 05:13.272
As you can see
by the images,

05:13.398 --> 05:14.816
everything appears
to be normal,

05:14.899 --> 05:16.317
which is good news

05:16.401 --> 05:19.320
because there were no lesions
from the scan,

05:19.779 --> 05:22.115
no hemorrhaging or bleeding,

05:22.240 --> 05:25.076
mild concussion,
a few stitches.

05:25.910 --> 05:31.290
The forearm,
however, is broken,
so that will require a cast.

05:31.416 --> 05:32.583
And how much
will that be?

05:32.667 --> 05:33.835
Excuse me?

05:33.918 --> 05:35.294
How much
will the co-pay be?

05:35.420 --> 05:38.423
Well, that's
something you need to discuss
with the billing department.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.133
- We'll talk about that later...
- Shut up.

05:40.842 --> 05:43.428
You've lost your job.
We have no money.

05:43.845 --> 05:45.763
How are we supposed
to pay for this

05:45.847 --> 05:47.181
on top of all
your other bills?

05:47.265 --> 05:48.766
Don't touch me.

05:48.850 --> 05:51.602
I told you,
there won't be any bills.

05:51.686 --> 05:53.813
Mr. and Mrs. Alderson,
please,

05:53.938 --> 05:57.275
I'm going to have to ask you
to step outside for a second.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.610
I'd like to talk
to Elliot alone.

06:11.122 --> 06:12.540
Elliot.

06:14.709 --> 06:18.296
Elliot, I want you
to know that you are
going to be just fine.

06:19.130 --> 06:21.340
Now, that was quite
a spill you took today,

06:22.675 --> 06:25.470
but I promise,
you have a long
and healthy life ahead of you.

06:26.137 --> 06:30.558
Now, Elliot, there
are just a few questions
that I need to ask you

06:30.641 --> 06:33.227
and anything you tell me
will be between us...

07:12.934 --> 07:14.018
Time to get up.

07:20.525 --> 07:22.443
<i>Today started
just like yesterday</i>

07:22.527 --> 07:25.947
<i>and the day before that
and the day before that</i>

07:26.239 --> 07:28.199
<i>and every day
for the last month,</i>

07:28.699 --> 07:31.661
<i>a loop,
my perfectly
constructed loop.</i>

07:31.744 --> 07:34.205
<i>This is going to be
affecting our economy</i>

07:34.288 --> 07:36.457
<i>in ways that are
extraordinarily significant.</i>

07:36.541 --> 07:40.128
<i>The FBI announced today,
and we can confirm,</i>

07:40.211 --> 07:43.881
<i>that Tyrell Wellick
and fsociety engaged
in this attack.</i>

07:44.882 --> 07:47.969
<i>They caused a lot of damage,
and we will respond.</i>

07:48.052 --> 07:49.637
<i>We will respond
proportionally,</i>

07:49.720 --> 07:53.641
<i>and we will respond
in a place and time
that we choose.</i>

07:53.724 --> 07:56.561
<i>That's not something
that I will announce
at a press conference.</i>

08:01.899 --> 08:04.152
<i>At 8:00 a.m.
my daily program begins</i>

08:04.235 --> 08:06.404
<i>by having breakfast
with my friend, Leon.</i>

08:06.571 --> 08:09.407
There's this one episode
where they go to
this Chinese restaurant,

08:09.657 --> 08:12.743
and they're just
waiting for a table
the entire time.

08:13.619 --> 08:15.746
Like, they don't even
eat at the end, bro.

08:15.830 --> 08:17.707
<i>He just
discovered</i> Seinfeld.

08:17.790 --> 08:19.458
Maybe I'm
overthinking it, though.

08:19.584 --> 08:21.419
<i>And talks
way too much about it.</i>

08:21.919 --> 08:23.379
<i>It's really fucking with him.</i>

08:23.462 --> 08:25.006
It's really fucking with me.

08:25.089 --> 08:26.591
<i>But
it's perfect for me.</i>

08:26.757 --> 08:29.594
<i>I don't have to say anything.
I can just listen.</i>

08:29.677 --> 08:31.387
God, man,
that Kramer dude,

08:31.470 --> 08:33.931
if I knew him in real life,
I'd knock his ass out.

08:34.182 --> 08:36.601
<i>At 10:00 a.m.
I help out around the house.</i>

08:38.269 --> 08:40.354
<i>More broadly, though,
this points to the need</i>

08:40.438 --> 08:43.191
<i>for us to work with
the international community</i>

08:43.274 --> 08:46.360
<i>to start setting up
some very clear
rules of the road.</i>

08:46.444 --> 08:48.654
<i>Right now it's
sort of the Wild West.</i>

08:49.488 --> 08:52.200
<i>At 12:00 p.m.
I have lunch with Leon.</i>

08:52.325 --> 08:53.951
And then
there's this one where

08:54.118 --> 08:55.786
they're stuck in
a garage the whole time.

08:55.995 --> 08:57.371
Like, what?

08:57.955 --> 08:59.373
That's not a TV show, bro.

08:59.457 --> 09:00.875
Where's the story?

09:01.125 --> 09:02.627
It just makes no sense.

09:06.214 --> 09:08.966
<i>At 2:00 p.m.
we'll check out
a basketball game.</i>

09:11.677 --> 09:14.472
<i>Hot Carla, the local pyro,
is usually there.</i>

09:18.893 --> 09:21.020
<i>She's become like
my personal totem.</i>

09:24.982 --> 09:27.193
- Oh! Oh!
- Three points, bitch.

09:27.318 --> 09:29.862
<i>I still
don't understand
why people like sports.</i>

09:30.029 --> 09:32.573
<i>They get so emotional
over the weirdest things.</i>

09:33.574 --> 09:35.910
<i>But I do see
the beauty in the rules,</i>

09:35.993 --> 09:38.246
<i>the invisible
code of chaos</i>

09:38.329 --> 09:40.414
<i>hiding behind
the menacing face of order.</i>

09:44.335 --> 09:47.880
<i>At 4:30 p.m. I clean up
around the house again.</i>

09:48.923 --> 09:52.510
<i>There hasn't been anything
like this in the past.</i>

09:53.177 --> 09:56.514
<i>That's part of what makes
this issue of cybersecurity
so urgent.</i>

09:57.014 --> 09:59.850
<i>At 6:00 p.m.
I have dinner with Leon.</i>

10:00.017 --> 10:02.311
Though maybe I just
need to make peace with it,

10:02.395 --> 10:03.479
you know what I'm saying?

10:03.562 --> 10:06.023
<i>As you can tell,
we eat most meals together.</i>

10:06.107 --> 10:08.067
Like, maybe that's
the show's point,

10:08.192 --> 10:09.944
that shit is just pointless,
you know?

10:10.027 --> 10:15.116
Like, life, love,
and the meanings therein.

10:19.203 --> 10:21.038
I'll tell you,
the human condition

10:21.122 --> 10:24.375
is a straight-up tragedy, cuz.
Word.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.627
<i>Like I said,
I never have to talk,</i>

10:26.711 --> 10:28.879
<i>and the repetition
is good for me now.</i>

10:29.213 --> 10:30.798
<i>It keeps my regimen intact.</i>

10:30.881 --> 10:32.049
Overwhelm me.

10:32.383 --> 10:34.552
<i>Two days a week
I go to a church group.</i>

10:35.136 --> 10:37.138
<i>I don't get
the rules here either,</i>

10:37.221 --> 10:39.140
<i>but I need to keep
socializing myself.</i>

10:39.223 --> 10:40.308
<i>It's good for me.</i>

10:40.599 --> 10:42.893
<i>Besides,
these people seem normal.</i>

10:43.060 --> 10:44.895
Amen.
Amen.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.357
<i>Do not get into a pattern</i>

10:48.441 --> 10:49.942
<i>in which you
are intimidated</i>

10:50.067 --> 10:52.528
<i>by these kind of
criminal attacks.</i>

10:52.611 --> 10:55.072
<i>America knows
how to solve problems,</i>

10:55.573 --> 10:58.242
<i>and when we work together,
we can't be stopped.</i>

10:58.492 --> 11:00.745
<i>A new future is
ready to be written.</i>

11:01.912 --> 11:03.247
<i>I've been
keeping a journal.</i>

11:04.999 --> 11:08.586
<i>It's the only way
to keep my program running
like it's supposed to.</i>

11:15.509 --> 11:16.844
See you in the morning.

11:17.303 --> 11:18.596
<i>And then I go to bed.</i>

11:19.013 --> 11:22.975
<i>My mom has no computer
or Internet access
to tempt me into the night.</i>

11:24.769 --> 11:28.022
<i>All that's left for me is just
ordinary analog sleep</i>

11:28.439 --> 11:29.774
<i>ending the day's loop.</i>

11:30.107 --> 11:32.943
<i>You might not think
it's a way to live,
but why not?</i>

11:33.110 --> 11:35.363
<i>Repeating
the same tasks each day</i>

11:35.446 --> 11:37.114
<i>without ever having
to think about them,</i>

11:37.281 --> 11:38.949
isn't that what
everybody does?

11:39.992 --> 11:41.452
Keep things on repeat

11:42.995 --> 11:48.125
to go along with
their <i>NCISes</i> and Lexapro.

11:50.461 --> 11:52.463
Isn't that where
it's comfortable?

11:54.465 --> 11:55.674
In the sameness?

12:05.309 --> 12:06.644
Why your mom?

12:07.645 --> 12:09.021
Why her specifically?

12:12.149 --> 12:14.151
She's the strictest
person I know.

12:15.861 --> 12:18.072
But you've attributed a lot
of your childhood trauma...

12:18.155 --> 12:21.700
Better the devil you know
than the devil
you don't, right?

12:27.915 --> 12:29.250
Do you feel alone?

12:35.923 --> 12:38.217
Darlene comes by
sometimes.

12:42.346 --> 12:44.515
Is there anything you miss
about your old life?

12:48.853 --> 12:50.688
It doesn't matter
even if I did.

12:51.689 --> 12:53.190
Why would you say that?

12:57.862 --> 13:00.030
'Cause I can't
trust myself back there.

13:01.198 --> 13:02.950
Why do you think you
can't trust yourself?

13:14.712 --> 13:16.630
I'd like you to respond
to my question, please.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.052
Elliot.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.222
It took a lot for me
to talk to you
after what you did,

13:26.891 --> 13:28.809
but I agreed
with the condition

13:28.893 --> 13:30.644
that you were going
to be more open with me.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.189
I was very clear
when we discussed...

13:33.272 --> 13:35.399
It's not that I
don't trust myself.

13:45.576 --> 13:46.994
I don't trust him.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.172
<i>Hello again.</i>

13:58.422 --> 14:00.424
<i>Yes, I'm talking
to you this time.</i>

14:00.799 --> 14:03.844
<i>I'm sure you wanted to hear
what I told Krista back there,</i>

14:04.428 --> 14:07.932
<i>but I'm not ready
to trust you yet,
not after what you did.</i>

14:08.474 --> 14:11.393
<i>You kept things from me,
and I don't know</i>

14:11.477 --> 14:13.604
<i>if I can tell you
secrets like before.</i>

14:14.939 --> 14:16.941
<i>Friends are supposed
to be honest with each other,</i>

14:17.149 --> 14:18.442
<i>and you weren't.</i>

14:18.776 --> 14:20.986
<i>It's gonna take a while
to rebuild this relation...</i>

14:21.111 --> 14:22.279
Talking to your friend again?

14:28.661 --> 14:29.954
I thought we were
done with all that.

14:31.789 --> 14:32.998
Here.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.334
Check that out.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.129
Lots of nicer
friends in there for you.

14:50.474 --> 14:51.976
We can't stay here.

14:52.309 --> 14:53.811
There's more work
to be done.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.730
Our revolution needs a leader,

14:56.814 --> 14:58.566
and what are we
doing instead?

14:58.649 --> 14:59.817
Journaling.

15:01.485 --> 15:04.863
Che Guevara is throwing up
in his grave right now.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.160
You think this is
gonna get rid of me?

15:10.828 --> 15:12.329
I am not to be
gotten rid of.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.500
This zombie act
you're pulling?
It don't work on us.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.586
This control you
think you have?

15:21.505 --> 15:22.673
It's an illusion.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.012
You want my attention?

15:30.222 --> 15:31.557
Tell me what I want to know.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.685
Tell me where Tyrell is.

15:36.228 --> 15:37.521
I can't do that.

15:42.026 --> 15:43.027
Then go...

16:02.796 --> 16:04.131
Are you done?

16:23.567 --> 16:26.987
What's next on
this roller coaster
of a regimen, needlepointing?

17:24.962 --> 17:28.841
<i>It is not
hyperbole to say we're in
a grave financial situation.</i>

17:28.966 --> 17:30.843
<i>All of this cautionary
sentiment out there,</i>

17:30.968 --> 17:32.803
<i>it's not just
Wall Street hoopla.</i>

17:33.345 --> 17:35.973
<i>The more I talk about it,
the more terrified I become.</i>

17:36.807 --> 17:38.642
<i>Fortunately,
the original plans
put in place were ineffective.</i>

17:38.726 --> 17:40.144
Bitcoin for sale.
Buy while it's low.

17:41.145 --> 17:44.189
<i>Most experts agree
that this is not
just a crisis,</i>

17:44.314 --> 17:45.774
<i>but a very dire one.</i>

17:45.899 --> 17:48.360
<i>Something absolutely
needs to be done.</i>

17:50.070 --> 17:53.407
<i>Even though the European Union
has been denying that
it could affect them,</i>

17:53.490 --> 17:56.118
<i>this week we saw
that they were wrong.</i>

17:56.201 --> 17:58.495
<i>The banks cannot lend money
that they don't have.</i>

17:58.829 --> 18:00.205
<i>So the economy is
at a standstill.</i>

18:22.728 --> 18:23.896
<i>And I'm just the messenger.</i>

18:24.021 --> 18:26.565
<i>I am telling you,
folks, this is what
they don't want you to hear,</i>

18:27.232 --> 18:29.985
<i>because a union strike
on the Comet natural gas plant</i>

18:30.068 --> 18:31.528
<i>will cause an energy shortage</i>

18:31.904 --> 18:34.406
<i>the likes of which
has never been seen
in the northeast.</i>

18:35.199 --> 18:37.576
<i>Without literal power,
we will have no power.</i>

18:38.076 --> 18:41.246
<i>This is part of a strategy
to declare economic war
on this country,</i>

18:41.413 --> 18:44.082
<i>and they know it,
they know exactly
what they are doing,</i>

18:44.374 --> 18:46.001
<i>and 2015 will be
known as the year</i>

18:46.084 --> 18:47.920
<i>that America,
this great nation,</i>

18:48.045 --> 18:51.423
<i>swapped democracy
for dictatorship.</i>

20:29.897 --> 20:32.441
<i>On television
blabbing on and on and on,
telling people...</i>

20:32.524 --> 20:33.775
<i>Lying to them.</i>

20:33.859 --> 20:35.193
<i>Instead, bring on the story...</i>

20:35.402 --> 20:37.029
<i>Somebody who can
explain the past</i>

20:37.321 --> 20:39.865
<i>because this "crisis"
has happened before.</i>

20:41.408 --> 20:42.701
Hello?

20:45.370 --> 20:48.832
<i>Why don't you
tell your viewers about
the Weimar Republic?</i>

20:49.207 --> 20:52.753
<i>Because the similarities,
the parallels between them
are disturbing.</i>

20:56.173 --> 20:58.216
<i>...meaning the end
of the world as we know it.</i>

21:02.220 --> 21:03.430
<i>Tyranny in the streets.</i>

21:07.059 --> 21:08.393
Hello?

21:11.897 --> 21:13.065
Hello?

21:14.733 --> 21:15.901
<i>That's right.</i>

21:18.612 --> 21:19.613
Stop!

21:24.576 --> 21:26.078
Well,
what am I supposed to do?

21:26.578 --> 21:28.246
I mean, nothing is working.

21:29.456 --> 21:30.749
Unplug what?

21:31.208 --> 21:33.627
Everything is
inside the walls.

21:34.795 --> 21:37.756
That's how it was installed
when I ordered
the smart house package.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.761
Now the alarm is going off,
and it's freezing.

21:42.886 --> 21:44.137
It's below 40.

21:46.473 --> 21:49.393
I have a place in Greenwich,
but you don't expect me to...

21:51.228 --> 21:53.438
How long is it gonna take
before this all gets fixed?

22:41.945 --> 22:44.948
The tracking on
her phone is working,

22:45.032 --> 22:47.200
and she's headed north
as we speak.

22:49.453 --> 22:51.121
How long you think
she's gonna stay away for?

22:52.289 --> 22:53.540
Long enough.

23:06.720 --> 23:13.727
<i>The collective result
of these attacks could be
a cyber Pearl Harbor,</i>

23:14.728 --> 23:17.564
<i>physical destruction
and the loss of life,</i>

23:18.190 --> 23:22.736
<i>and create a new,
profound sense
of vulnerability.</i>

23:24.362 --> 23:28.033
<i>As director of the CIA
and Secretary of Defense...</i>

23:33.747 --> 23:35.332
I hope you don't mind
I came.

23:44.382 --> 23:45.759
Something wrong?

23:49.346 --> 23:50.931
It's good
to see you, Gideon.

23:53.517 --> 23:54.684
You, too.

23:55.685 --> 23:58.271
I know we didn't leave things
on the best of terms.

24:00.690 --> 24:03.693
Is it true?
What I heard about Allsafe?

24:05.028 --> 24:06.404
There is no Allsafe.

24:08.573 --> 24:10.033
I've had to furlough everyone.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.287
I'm hoping to get
up and running again,

24:14.371 --> 24:17.040
but everyone's
telling me it's over.

24:17.707 --> 24:19.292
Gee, I wonder
whose fault that is.

24:19.751 --> 24:21.211
Was that you or me?

24:21.545 --> 24:24.047
I'm getting all mixed up,
I can't recall.

24:24.881 --> 24:26.091
Let me get to my point.

24:27.801 --> 24:30.554
The FBI believes that
I was behind the hack

24:30.971 --> 24:32.430
or complicit in some way.

24:33.890 --> 24:35.600
I've given them all
the evidence I can.

24:35.892 --> 24:38.728
I've cooperated with them
every step of the way,

24:38.812 --> 24:40.647
but they still
keep coming at me.

24:41.231 --> 24:43.316
They don't trust me.

24:44.401 --> 24:47.946
In fact, I think they might be
hacking my email.
I know someone is.

24:48.321 --> 24:49.865
And now
you're wondering

24:49.948 --> 24:52.576
who that someone is,
aren't you?

24:53.076 --> 24:56.663
There are logins
from times and machines
I don't recognize.

24:56.746 --> 24:59.666
Because if it was me,
then that means it was you.

25:00.292 --> 25:01.585
How about it, huh?

25:02.085 --> 25:05.088
Could you live with yourself
knowing that
you framed Gideon?

25:05.589 --> 25:07.799
I keep changing the password,
but it still...

25:09.259 --> 25:10.468
Elliot?

25:13.930 --> 25:15.974
What's wrong?
Go ahead, tell him.

25:16.975 --> 25:19.644
Tell him that you're slowly
descending into madness.

25:19.769 --> 25:21.605
Stop.
What? Stop what?

25:21.771 --> 25:23.023
There are only so many times

25:23.106 --> 25:25.775
before my bullets
finally penetrate that
thick skull of yours,

25:26.443 --> 25:30.113
and as the blood trickles out,
so goes any sense of reason.

25:30.614 --> 25:34.284
Round and round we go,
you not knowing what
you did or didn't do,

25:35.327 --> 25:37.120
our infinite loop of insanity.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.373
If you know
anything at all,

25:41.291 --> 25:44.502
or if there's anything
you can do to help me...

25:48.340 --> 25:49.633
I need you to.

25:51.885 --> 25:53.303
I can't help you.

25:54.804 --> 25:56.973
Are you really gonna let him
take the fall for this?

25:57.849 --> 26:01.061
Look at him,
a scared, small animal.

26:01.144 --> 26:03.980
Well, that's...
That's unacceptable.

26:05.649 --> 26:08.526
Now he's doing
what all small animals do
when they're scared,

26:08.818 --> 26:10.820
pretend they're
bigger and scarier.

26:10.904 --> 26:12.656
Look, if you're not gonna
do anything about this,

26:13.490 --> 26:14.950
I'm afraid you've
left me no choice

26:15.033 --> 26:17.244
but to go to them
with what I know,

26:17.702 --> 26:20.163
which, given the things I know
about the day you left,

26:20.997 --> 26:22.332
it's pretty damning.

26:22.999 --> 26:25.752
Now,
I'm asking you one last time

26:27.337 --> 26:29.381
to do the right thing.

26:29.506 --> 26:30.590
He does have a point.

26:31.508 --> 26:33.927
He does know a lot,
perhaps too much.

26:34.427 --> 26:37.722
I wonder if I sliced
open his neck right now,

26:38.181 --> 26:40.183
would it be me doing it,
or would it be you?

26:40.350 --> 26:41.851
No.
Yes.

26:43.019 --> 26:44.896
I am going to go to them.

26:46.022 --> 26:48.108
I'm going to tell
them everything.

26:48.191 --> 26:51.027
Do you understand, Elliot?
Everything.

26:51.111 --> 26:52.737
Truth is, Elliot,
it doesn't matter.

26:53.571 --> 26:55.448
You start adding
up all the choices
you've been making,

26:55.532 --> 26:57.033
they all add up to one thing.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.703
You add up to one thing...

26:59.911 --> 27:01.079
Me.

27:05.208 --> 27:06.459
What's going on
over there?

27:41.077 --> 27:42.746
<i>I'm not gonna lie,
Gideon got to me,</i>

27:42.829 --> 27:45.081
<i>but now is when I need
the regimen the most.</i>

27:54.591 --> 27:58.261
<i>After all,
that's the whole reason
for the routine,</i>

27:58.762 --> 28:01.598
<i>to stay as sane as possible
until he's gone,</i>

28:01.931 --> 28:03.099
<i>and once he's gone,</i>

28:03.475 --> 28:05.518
<i>I can finally be
the real me again.</i>

28:05.602 --> 28:07.812
You know,
not just that it's pointless,

28:07.937 --> 28:10.398
but maybe it just
means nothing, you know?

28:10.482 --> 28:14.444
Like Costanza says,
"A cold, random universe."

28:17.947 --> 28:20.450
Bro, what's up with the...

28:22.494 --> 28:23.787
Nothing, man.

28:25.663 --> 28:27.290
Gideon's gonna rat you out.

28:32.629 --> 28:33.963
He probably already has.

28:37.842 --> 28:40.220
Hey, you can't ignore this.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.013
They have eyes on you.

28:42.138 --> 28:44.140
This is how they work you.

28:45.308 --> 28:46.976
I'm not gonna change my mind.

28:48.812 --> 28:50.063
Sticking to my regimen.

28:50.480 --> 28:54.150
Hey, I am not some
tumor to be excised,
do you understand?

28:54.359 --> 28:55.485
The opposite.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.862
I'm the organ vital
to your existence.

28:58.988 --> 29:00.657
Now, if you insist
on keeping this up,

29:00.907 --> 29:02.575
I'm gonna go from
annoyed to hurt,

29:02.659 --> 29:06.579
and, kiddo, trust me,
you do not want to
hurt my feelings.

29:11.084 --> 29:14.212
<i>How do
I take off a mask
when it stops being a mask,</i>

29:14.921 --> 29:17.215
<i>when it's as much
a part of me as I am?</i>

29:21.261 --> 29:22.595
<i>We keep fighting.</i>

29:22.679 --> 29:27.016
<i>Like the world we unmasked,
we will find our
true selves again.</i>

29:27.892 --> 29:31.062
<i>Maybe after wiping
away the thick, grimy film</i>

29:31.187 --> 29:33.690
<i>of Facebook friend requests
and Vine stars</i>

29:34.524 --> 29:36.276
<i>we can all see
the light of day.</i>

29:37.235 --> 29:39.237
<i>I know we haven't
talked in a while.</i>

29:39.362 --> 29:42.907
<i>Maybe you only trust me
about as much as
I trust you right now,</i>

29:43.700 --> 29:46.411
<i>but I'm gonna ask you
to have hope for me anyway.</i>

29:47.245 --> 29:49.372
<i>Just, please, have hope.</i>

30:11.895 --> 30:13.813
I'm gonna take a selfie.
I'm gonna take a selfie.

30:13.897 --> 30:14.981
You guys ready?
Oh, yeah!

30:18.735 --> 30:20.111
We got the balls!

30:55.104 --> 30:56.439
We got the balls!

31:06.950 --> 31:08.117
Give me your phone.

31:09.953 --> 31:11.246
Why? I didn't post any...

31:11.329 --> 31:13.206
Give me your phone.

31:47.323 --> 31:52.370
We are in a war,
and we are on
the losing side of it.

31:53.663 --> 31:56.541
We are on our knees
with guns to our heads,

31:56.666 --> 31:59.419
and they are
picking us off one by one.

32:04.924 --> 32:11.556
Susan Jacobs,
the general counsel at E Corp.

32:14.434 --> 32:16.686
You want to know
what her nickname is
inside the company?

32:17.937 --> 32:20.356
Madam Executioner,

32:21.941 --> 32:23.568
not just
because she could kill

32:23.693 --> 32:25.236
any lawsuit
filed against them,

32:27.030 --> 32:31.200
but because those lawsuits
usually involved deaths.

32:32.535 --> 32:35.538
These are the cowards
we are dealing with.

32:40.460 --> 32:43.713
We have been on our knees
for too long,

32:44.464 --> 32:47.884
and it's time to stand up.

32:51.387 --> 32:53.556
Make it
a four-hour SDR if necessary.

32:54.891 --> 32:56.809
Take surveillance
detection stops.

32:56.893 --> 32:58.102
Go into pharmacies.

32:58.227 --> 32:59.896
Run errands.
Disrupt data points.

33:00.396 --> 33:02.815
No one takes the same
route back here twice.

33:03.483 --> 33:05.401
I don't want anyone
burning this location.

33:15.578 --> 33:17.080
Where is everyone else?

33:18.414 --> 33:19.624
Don't know.

33:22.251 --> 33:23.586
They were always half in.

33:27.256 --> 33:31.094
What you're doing here,
Darlene, and what
you're saying?

33:32.136 --> 33:36.307
I mean, you sounded
like George W. Bush,
for crying out loud.

33:36.432 --> 33:38.434
Okay,
first of all, that's low.

33:39.310 --> 33:42.188
Secondly, give me some credit.

33:42.689 --> 33:44.440
The speech is bullshit,
but it works.

33:45.441 --> 33:46.693
It riles them up.

33:46.776 --> 33:48.111
Yeah, to what end though?

33:48.611 --> 33:51.531
You know, sawing off balls,
making protest signs?

33:53.199 --> 33:54.325
We were more than that.

33:54.450 --> 33:55.993
I mean, you know,
we accomplished something.

33:56.119 --> 33:57.286
We took them down.

33:57.370 --> 33:59.163
Then why does it feel
like they're still winning?

34:01.541 --> 34:05.128
That what we did made
it worse, not better?

34:08.631 --> 34:09.882
You know I'm right.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.302
We didn't finish them off.

34:13.970 --> 34:15.304
That's all there is to it.

34:16.139 --> 34:18.683
People everywhere came out
to support us, Mobley,

34:18.808 --> 34:21.310
and right now
they need to know
we haven't given up,

34:22.145 --> 34:24.647
that we meant what we said
about changing the world.

34:54.010 --> 34:56.429
Don't be half in
like the others.

34:58.681 --> 35:03.019
This thing we started,
it deserves more than that.

35:14.530 --> 35:18.201
Have you, uh, seen Elliot?

35:20.536 --> 35:21.871
That's not important.

35:23.956 --> 35:26.375
This is everything right now.

35:33.549 --> 35:36.010
Absolutely unfair,
madam, absolutely unfair.

35:36.093 --> 35:37.428
We were done
with our payments.

35:37.553 --> 35:39.180
Ma'am,
we are doing our best here.

35:39.263 --> 35:40.598
At this moment
we cannot verify

35:40.723 --> 35:41.766
that you've paid
all your payments.

35:41.891 --> 35:43.559
Absolutely ridiculous. I have.

35:43.643 --> 35:46.270
I have all my
bills right here.
I was never late on one,

35:46.395 --> 35:48.147
and I also have copies
of the checks that I sent...

35:48.231 --> 35:49.524
People have been
forging paper records.

35:49.607 --> 35:52.109
We haven't set up a system
to verify these
sorts of claims.

35:52.235 --> 35:54.445
It took me three weeks
to get this appointment,
madam.

35:54.570 --> 35:56.072
Now you're telling me
you can't help me?

35:56.322 --> 35:57.907
What kind of business is this?

35:58.241 --> 36:01.494
I've been responsible
for the last 20 years
in paying off my home.

36:01.786 --> 36:03.246
Where's your accountability?

36:03.496 --> 36:04.872
Yet,
if the tables were turned,

36:04.956 --> 36:06.415
you would have kicked me
out of my own house.

36:07.166 --> 36:09.710
You know what?
Cancel my account.

36:09.794 --> 36:11.754
I'm done doing business
with you crooks.

36:11.838 --> 36:13.464
You deserve what
you're getting.

36:13.589 --> 36:16.717
Ma'am, I can't say for sure
we can give you all your money

36:16.801 --> 36:17.927
if you close right now.

36:18.010 --> 36:19.136
Unbelievable.

36:19.428 --> 36:22.640
I know what I have.
I just want to cancel.

36:47.206 --> 36:50.459
It's on my computer, too.
I have the IT guy
helping me right now.

37:26.495 --> 37:29.498
Sorry I'm late. I was coming
from my place in Greenwich.

37:32.418 --> 37:34.420
I was on the phone
with the FBI all night.

37:35.671 --> 37:37.173
We can't confirm the sender,

37:38.049 --> 37:39.926
but the email we
received is authentic,

37:40.009 --> 37:43.763
more than likely
the same hackers
from the ransomware.

37:45.097 --> 37:46.390
Unbelievable.

37:47.934 --> 37:49.352
What are their demands again?

37:51.020 --> 37:52.855
$5.9 million.

37:54.857 --> 37:57.318
$5.9 million to
be delivered to

37:57.401 --> 37:59.946
Battery Park City,
9:00 p.m. tonight,

38:00.613 --> 38:01.781
no police.

38:02.615 --> 38:06.369
If we want to pay the ransom,
the FBI will not sanction it.

38:06.869 --> 38:09.622
We cannot negotiate
with these people.

38:10.414 --> 38:11.791
Our techs are looking into it.

38:11.874 --> 38:14.627
We'll find a way to decrypt it
and get the system...

38:14.710 --> 38:15.920
How long?

38:17.296 --> 38:19.215
Five days, tops.

38:19.966 --> 38:22.385
Five days for
our banking system
to be down?

38:23.469 --> 38:25.054
That's a lot of
money down the drain.

38:25.137 --> 38:26.722
I don't even want to
mention the optics.

38:27.390 --> 38:29.141
We can't afford
this hack right now,

38:30.267 --> 38:34.146
and frankly, I think
we can find $5.9 million
in between our couch cushions.

38:34.230 --> 38:35.398
It's nothing.

38:35.773 --> 38:39.402
My opinion as general
counsel is to pay it.

38:40.486 --> 38:43.280
What's this other
request they've made?

38:45.241 --> 38:48.035
"You must send
one of your chiefs

38:48.119 --> 38:49.328
"and no one else?"

38:50.746 --> 38:53.332
I think they meant one
of our chief officers.

38:56.252 --> 38:57.837
This is a joke.

38:58.421 --> 39:00.756
Did they really
expect one of us
to go out there?

39:01.173 --> 39:02.591
Hmm? What are we
talking about here?

39:02.675 --> 39:05.678
These people are terrorists,
pure and simple.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.764
Unfortunately,
I have to agree
with Scott on this.

39:09.181 --> 39:10.433
It's risky.

39:11.267 --> 39:13.477
We have no idea
what these guys
are capable of.

39:13.936 --> 39:16.522
So you think we
should pay the ransom,

39:16.605 --> 39:19.191
but you don't want
any of us to do it?

39:19.525 --> 39:22.695
We can get one of our security
officers to go undercover.

39:23.029 --> 39:25.239
Yes, and risk all of this
blowing up in our faces.

39:25.322 --> 39:26.365
No.

39:29.118 --> 39:31.120
If we're going to
even consider doing this,

39:31.704 --> 39:34.290
we shouldn't give them
any reason to do more damage.

39:42.965 --> 39:44.175
I'll do it.

39:51.057 --> 39:52.683
I'm Chief Technology Officer.

39:53.017 --> 39:54.226
I qualify.

39:54.643 --> 39:55.811
I'll do it.

40:04.361 --> 40:05.988
If we're gonna
pay these bastards,

40:08.741 --> 40:10.367
I want to be
the one that faces them.

40:48.697 --> 40:51.200
<i>For more variety from
the '80s through today.</i>

41:08.634 --> 41:09.802
Anything?

41:12.221 --> 41:13.222
<i>Nothing yet.</i>

42:07.818 --> 42:09.778
Who is that? Who is that,
that guy on the bike?

42:10.529 --> 42:12.198
He looks like he's coming
straight toward me.

42:12.615 --> 42:13.991
<i>Okay, he's closing in.
We're coming.</i>

42:14.116 --> 42:15.868
No, wait.
<i>It's too risky.
We need to fly in.</i>

42:15.951 --> 42:17.036
Wait.

42:19.622 --> 42:23.209
Are you...
From E Corp?

42:24.376 --> 42:25.753
Who are you?

42:25.836 --> 42:27.171
Just making
a delivery.

42:27.296 --> 42:28.380
Please sign here.

42:55.574 --> 42:56.742
What is this?

42:57.493 --> 42:59.453
<i>Someone grab the biker.
Grab the biker.</i>

42:59.536 --> 43:01.664
No, no, no, they haven't
picked up the money yet.

43:14.593 --> 43:16.053
<i>Mr. Knowles,
we don't recommend that.</i>

43:16.178 --> 43:17.596
<i>We should have our
unit search it first.</i>

43:42.621 --> 43:43.872
<i>Sir, are you all right?</i>

43:44.623 --> 43:46.375
<i>Should we come in?
Are you all right?</i>

43:47.293 --> 43:48.460
<i>Is that your phone?</i>

43:52.131 --> 43:54.049
<i>You have 10 seconds
to do what it says,</i>

43:54.133 --> 43:55.968
<i>or every Bank of E system
will be bricked.</i>

44:01.140 --> 44:02.641
<i>Sir, who was the caller?</i>

44:16.655 --> 44:18.407
<i>Mr. Knowles,
what are you doing?</i>

46:12.521 --> 46:13.730
There's no way.

46:14.857 --> 46:18.610
We've already
committed $900 billion.

46:19.528 --> 46:21.947
It would be irresponsible
if the feds sent more.

46:22.364 --> 46:24.908
And we're not going
to ask the government
to pony up the cash.

46:25.701 --> 46:28.537
How do you burn through
that kind of money
in 30 days anyway?

46:29.371 --> 46:31.457
You have
something right there.

46:32.082 --> 46:33.625
Finally,
you're seeing my point.

46:34.626 --> 46:36.503
No, no, on your face.

46:38.547 --> 46:39.798
The point is, Phillip,

46:39.882 --> 46:42.468
we've already given you
our burst of cash on hand.

46:42.551 --> 46:43.719
We can't give you any more.

46:43.802 --> 46:45.637
Well, we'll sell
the T-bills to the Chinese,

46:45.721 --> 46:48.974
and that money in return
will be used as a loan
for our company.

46:49.057 --> 46:51.894
Look,
the real recovery program
is months from being done.

46:52.311 --> 46:53.854
The public
is hoarding cash.

46:54.313 --> 46:56.273
The housing market
is grinding to a halt.

46:56.482 --> 46:58.734
The big three are on
the verge of collapse.

46:58.817 --> 47:00.986
Everyone at the commission
needs to see results

47:01.069 --> 47:02.488
within the next three weeks

47:02.571 --> 47:03.822
before we can
do anything else.

47:04.948 --> 47:09.161
Look, rebuilding
our database is the only
solution to this problem.

47:09.244 --> 47:10.579
This is not my opinion.

47:11.079 --> 47:12.956
These are the facts,
ladies and gentlemen.

47:13.165 --> 47:15.542
Now, I've cooperated
with you on every level.

47:15.626 --> 47:18.462
I even have the goddamn FBI
working out of my offices.

47:18.795 --> 47:23.091
Janet, Mary, Jack, please.

47:25.010 --> 47:27.846
Tell me you didn't ask me
to fly down all the way to DC

47:27.930 --> 47:30.182
just so you could, what,
hear yourselves complain?

47:33.227 --> 47:34.520
You've got to resign.

47:35.604 --> 47:36.772
We have no other options.

47:36.855 --> 47:39.566
The President
can't go to Congress
with a bailout right now.

47:48.367 --> 47:50.410
In the fallout of
the Great Depression,

47:51.995 --> 47:56.166
FDR closed all the banks
for a bank holiday,

47:57.209 --> 47:59.878
and then
he reopened them
in stages

48:00.587 --> 48:04.091
when they were
reported to being sound.

48:06.093 --> 48:10.222
Later, historians discovered
what we in this room now know,

48:10.305 --> 48:13.559
that those reports,
they were mostly lies.

48:14.935 --> 48:17.271
Nevertheless, it worked.

48:18.897 --> 48:21.441
It worked because
the public believed

48:22.317 --> 48:25.153
the government had
everything under control.

48:27.990 --> 48:29.241
You see,

48:29.866 --> 48:32.244
that is the business model
for this great nation of ours.

48:32.327 --> 48:34.663
Every business day
when that market bell rings,

48:34.746 --> 48:37.583
we con people into
believing in something,

48:38.250 --> 48:41.587
the American dream,
family values.

48:42.379 --> 48:45.340
Could be freedom fries
for all I care.

48:45.424 --> 48:50.679
It doesn't matter as
long as the con works

48:51.847 --> 48:57.603
and people buy and sell
whatever it is
we want them to.

49:01.189 --> 49:02.608
If I resign,

49:04.901 --> 49:11.199
then any scrap of confidence
the public is
already clinging onto

49:11.283 --> 49:12.951
will be destroyed,

49:15.245 --> 49:16.788
and we all know

49:17.706 --> 49:23.462
a con doesn't work
without the confidence.

49:29.134 --> 49:32.429
If this was the best idea
you could come up with
for a win,

49:34.348 --> 49:35.974
I shouldn't be
the one resigning.

49:39.102 --> 49:40.479
I have to head
back to New York.

49:40.812 --> 49:42.439
Let me know when
you've locked up the votes,

49:42.689 --> 49:44.358
and wipe your goddamn mouth.

50:24.481 --> 50:25.565
Well?

50:28.068 --> 50:29.152
You moved.

50:31.238 --> 50:32.322
And?

50:36.410 --> 50:37.828
Now I'm gonna punish you.

51:03.311 --> 51:04.521
You know, usual,
coffee, black,

51:04.604 --> 51:05.689
turkey sandwich
on whole wheat,

51:05.772 --> 51:07.023
lettuce, mayo,
muenster cheese.

51:07.774 --> 51:08.900
Already working on it.

51:08.984 --> 51:10.777
You always take
good care of me, Ahmed.

51:11.027 --> 51:12.028
How's the wife doing?

51:12.112 --> 51:13.739
She's good,
she's good, thank you.

51:14.614 --> 51:16.867
Oh, I haven't
seen her in a while.
Where is she these days?

51:17.951 --> 51:20.245
Our daughter is sick.
Oh, that right?

51:20.328 --> 51:21.663
That's too bad.

51:21.872 --> 51:23.790
Now, which one
is she again?
Sally.

51:24.958 --> 51:25.959
The young one, right?

51:26.042 --> 51:27.043
Yeah.

51:28.378 --> 51:29.671
Such a pretty name.

51:31.256 --> 51:33.133
Now, is that
traditionally
an Iranian name, or...

51:33.216 --> 51:34.718
Come on, lady,
I'm in a rush here.

51:36.011 --> 51:38.638
Jesus H, all right.

51:38.889 --> 51:40.098
God, calm down.

51:40.807 --> 51:42.225
Well, I guess
I should pay up, Ahmed,

51:42.309 --> 51:43.685
before I get
lynched over here.

51:48.690 --> 51:49.775
Am I right?

51:52.736 --> 51:53.737
Um...

51:56.823 --> 51:58.116
And this?

52:00.118 --> 52:01.745
DiPierro,
he's waiting for us.

52:02.621 --> 52:03.663
Yup.

52:44.371 --> 52:48.083
<i>When you look closely
at the seams
between order and chaos,</i>

52:49.334 --> 52:51.378
<i>do you see
the same things I see?</i>

52:52.295 --> 52:54.214
<i>The strain, the tears,</i>

52:54.714 --> 52:56.967
<i>the glimpses of truth
hidden underneath.</i>

52:58.051 --> 53:01.012
<i>Why do they fight
so desperately to mask
what they are?</i>

53:01.805 --> 53:05.058
<i>Or is it that they
become who they are
when they put on the mask?</i>

53:06.017 --> 53:09.521
<i>Sometimes I wonder
what you hide behind,
my silent friend.</i>

53:09.896 --> 53:11.439
<i>What mask do you wear?</i>

53:12.482 --> 53:14.818
<i>Or are you just as afraid
as the rest of them?</i>

53:15.485 --> 53:16.528
<i>Me?</i>

53:17.320 --> 53:18.613
<i>Am I afraid?</i>

53:19.114 --> 53:20.240
<i>Nah, man.</i>

53:20.991 --> 53:22.200
<i>I'm different.</i>

53:24.244 --> 53:26.454
Hey, dipshit,

53:28.582 --> 53:30.166
can't you see
we need the ball?

53:37.007 --> 53:38.091
This ball?

53:38.174 --> 53:39.217
Yeah, that ball.

53:39.301 --> 53:40.969
What, you slow or something?
What's up?

53:41.261 --> 53:42.804
Nah, I ain't slow, bro.

53:44.598 --> 53:46.182
Go get your own ball.

53:46.349 --> 53:47.601
Yo, man.
What?

53:47.684 --> 53:48.977
What's your problem, son?

53:49.060 --> 53:50.520
What's your problem?
You my problem.

53:50.604 --> 53:52.188
You need to learn
how to speak to people.

53:52.272 --> 53:54.107
- You need to have respect, son.
- I got it.

54:01.448 --> 54:03.241
Hey, I got it.

54:11.917 --> 54:13.001
It's all good.

54:19.424 --> 54:20.926
We're all just here
to have a good time, right?

54:21.676 --> 54:22.969
Yes, sir.

54:28.892 --> 54:30.560
Come here, girl.

54:32.562 --> 54:33.563
There you go.

54:38.985 --> 54:40.862
Maxine's been acting
a little off lately.

54:41.696 --> 54:43.114
She really perked up
when she saw you.

54:43.531 --> 54:44.866
You a dog person?

54:46.660 --> 54:47.953
Used to have one.

54:50.121 --> 54:52.290
Oh, yeah?
What happened to it?

54:54.668 --> 54:55.961
Don't have her anymore.

55:04.678 --> 55:05.971
Elliot, right?

55:08.348 --> 55:09.599
I'm Ray.

55:10.141 --> 55:11.351
I've seen you here before.

55:11.685 --> 55:13.019
You must like the games, huh?

55:15.730 --> 55:17.649
They put Bradstreet in.
He's good on the boards.

55:18.108 --> 55:19.234
Come on, boys.

55:25.115 --> 55:26.866
Look at these guys.
What do you see?

55:27.993 --> 55:30.996
A lot of care and effort
over what amounts to
a pretty shitty game.

55:31.746 --> 55:33.206
What's Maxine see?

55:33.832 --> 55:35.208
A bunch of dumb animals,

55:35.542 --> 55:38.044
can't think past anything
but getting a ball in a hoop.

55:39.713 --> 55:41.131
What do they want you to see?

55:43.049 --> 55:44.426
Badass homies...

55:45.552 --> 55:47.387
Ready to kill
if you step to 'em.

55:49.222 --> 55:50.432
Question is...

55:51.474 --> 55:52.809
Which is the truth?

55:53.268 --> 55:56.062
Maybe all of 'em.
Maybe none of 'em.

55:56.813 --> 55:59.024
Maybe truth don't even exist.

56:00.358 --> 56:02.235
Maybe what we think is
all we got,

56:03.570 --> 56:05.488
which is why
I'm a little jealous
of Maxine over here,

56:05.572 --> 56:08.408
'cause all she
gives a shit about
is eating and sleeping.

56:08.825 --> 56:10.118
Ain't that right, girl?

56:17.250 --> 56:19.210
Not the loquacious type,
I get it.

56:20.045 --> 56:22.005
Me, I talk all the time,

56:22.922 --> 56:24.591
but I guess you
picked up on that.

56:25.216 --> 56:28.636
It's cool though.
Communication is good
for my line of work.

56:30.221 --> 56:32.015
Takes a lot of it
to run a good business.

56:32.849 --> 56:35.060
But unlike you,
when it comes to computers,
well,

56:36.436 --> 56:39.272
I get them about as much as
Maxine here gets
E. E. Cummings,

56:39.856 --> 56:40.899
so when I heard...

56:40.982 --> 56:43.151
Whatever you heard,
it's not true.
I don't do that anymore.

56:45.445 --> 56:48.865
- Tell him you'll help.
- Try it once, huh?

56:49.866 --> 56:51.409
Let that old
feeling come back.

56:51.951 --> 56:53.369
You know,
this morning over breakfast

56:53.453 --> 56:55.121
my wife told me
I'd make a friend today.

56:56.456 --> 56:58.875
Not many people to
talk to around here
except for these knuckleheads.

57:00.460 --> 57:01.795
It's cool if we
continue talking?

57:03.171 --> 57:04.547
No, thanks.

57:07.300 --> 57:08.384
Damn, man.

57:09.719 --> 57:12.680
That's some cold,
brutal shit right there.

57:13.890 --> 57:16.017
I'ma have to go listen
to some Adele on repeat

57:16.101 --> 57:17.143
when I get back home.

57:22.148 --> 57:25.110
Okay, I can take a hint.

57:26.486 --> 57:27.821
Come on, babe.

57:32.117 --> 57:34.786
How long you gonna keep us
in this analog nightmare?

57:37.497 --> 57:38.832
<i>As long as it takes.</i>

57:39.833 --> 57:44.170
<i>Without my weapon of choice,
Mr. Robot is unplugged,
powerless.</i>

57:44.879 --> 57:46.172
<i>He'll try to wear us down,</i>

57:46.256 --> 57:49.759
<i>but as long as
we stick to the regimen,
he can't take control</i>

57:50.301 --> 57:53.179
<i>no matter how
much of an illusion
he thinks this is.</i>

57:55.348 --> 57:57.350
<i>I mean, it's a disgrace,</i>

57:57.559 --> 58:02.272
<i>an absolute disgrace
police have not
found this guy.</i>

58:02.355 --> 58:06.693
<i>Not only does all the evidence
behind the Five/Nine
attacks lead to him,</i>

58:07.443 --> 58:11.364
<i>but he is
the leading suspect behind
the Sharon Knowles murder.</i>

58:11.698 --> 58:14.033
<i>I've said it before.
I'll say it again.</i>

58:14.701 --> 58:18.454
<i>The misogynistic blind eye
by law enforcement in this...</i>

58:18.830 --> 58:20.123
<i>My problem, Stassi.</i>

58:20.206 --> 58:22.083
<i>I hit her for
a...</i> <i>reason.</i>

58:22.167 --> 58:23.501
<i>She...</i>
<i>my ex-boyfriend...</i>

58:23.585 --> 58:24.961
Hey, Vanderpump's on.
You want to watch?

58:26.379 --> 58:27.839
Another time.
<i>You know what?</i>

58:28.423 --> 58:30.300
<i>I'll walk away and
let this be about you.</i>

58:30.508 --> 58:32.802
How was I that time?
Did I do okay?

58:32.886 --> 58:34.888
I didn't hurt
you too bad, right?

58:35.263 --> 58:36.598
You're spoiling it again.

58:36.890 --> 58:38.600
<i>At least I didn't
break a couple up.</i>

58:40.727 --> 58:42.228
Do you want to go
have a drink at the bar?

58:43.271 --> 58:44.647
You know,
I know the guy who works here

58:44.731 --> 58:46.357
makes awesome
mescal cocktails.

58:46.441 --> 58:48.067
We used to
bartend together back
at this place...

58:48.151 --> 58:50.987
We're not to be seen together,
remember?

58:51.070 --> 58:52.280
That was our agreement.

58:57.160 --> 58:58.494
That's him,
isn't it?

58:59.829 --> 59:01.664
Freaks me out.
Can't he wait downstairs?

59:04.417 --> 59:05.668
He's doing his job.

59:12.467 --> 59:13.676
She's still in the tub.

59:16.512 --> 59:18.306
You said 2:00. It's 2:15.

59:22.310 --> 59:23.603
Hand me a towel?

59:30.443 --> 59:32.820
Go. We can't leave together.

59:48.253 --> 59:51.673
So unfair. She came
out of nowhere a month ago.

59:52.215 --> 59:53.841
Sometimes I see her
talking to herself.

59:54.759 --> 59:56.219
Oh, my gosh, you did, too?

59:57.011 --> 59:58.304
So weird.

59:58.638 --> 1:00:00.723
Yeah,
Melissa hates her, too.

1:00:01.432 --> 1:00:03.351
Shit, I got to take this.
I'll call you back.

1:00:05.812 --> 1:00:07.480
I'm telling you,
it's non-negotiable.

1:00:07.647 --> 1:00:10.233
<i>No one's going
to let you take that
question off the table.</i>

1:00:10.316 --> 1:00:11.401
<i>The money burning
is a big part</i>

1:00:11.484 --> 1:00:13.111
<i>of why everyone
wants the exclusive.</i>

1:00:13.194 --> 1:00:14.404
Bloomberg, line two for you.

1:00:14.487 --> 1:00:16.406
<i>Except for CNN,
which you guys don't want...</i>

1:00:16.489 --> 1:00:18.574
I got to call you back.
Hi, Foster.

1:00:18.658 --> 1:00:19.909
<i>I thought
the deadline was noon.</i>

1:00:19.993 --> 1:00:20.994
It's noon now.

1:00:21.077 --> 1:00:22.578
<i>It's five past, Angela, and...</i>

1:00:22.662 --> 1:00:23.830
Ryder's agreeing
to the questions.

1:00:24.038 --> 1:00:26.124
He's also giving us top
of the hour and Kelly.

1:00:26.207 --> 1:00:27.542
<i>Price doesn't even like Kelly.</i>

1:00:28.167 --> 1:00:31.087
<i>I'll budge on the time slot,
but I can't on the question.
It's fair game.</i>

1:00:31.170 --> 1:00:32.588
Talk to the segment producer
and call me back.

1:00:32.672 --> 1:00:33.965
<i>Angela,
I already know the answer.</i>

1:00:34.048 --> 1:00:35.967
<i>You were supposed
to make this happen
five minutes ago...</i>

1:00:36.050 --> 1:00:37.176
Just call me back.

1:00:38.011 --> 1:00:39.053
Call Markinson.

1:00:39.304 --> 1:00:42.181
We don't want CNBC,
or Fox News, for that matter.

1:00:42.724 --> 1:00:44.517
I think you should
let Melissa handle this.

1:00:45.935 --> 1:00:47.270
- Done deal?
<i>- Not gonna happen.</i>

1:00:47.353 --> 1:00:51.232
<i>Scott Knowles burning
$5.9 million is on the table
or not at all.</i>

1:00:51.316 --> 1:00:52.567
We're going with CNBC.

1:00:52.650 --> 1:00:54.193
They're sending
a deal memo as we speak.

1:00:54.277 --> 1:00:57.071
You know I would
rather go with you.
You got to twist their arm.

1:00:58.531 --> 1:00:59.782
<i>Bullshit.</i>

1:01:04.203 --> 1:01:05.955
Did you just hang up
on Bloomberg?

1:01:07.790 --> 1:01:09.167
Are you trying to get fired?

1:01:10.668 --> 1:01:11.836
Leave.

1:01:12.253 --> 1:01:13.588
Excuse me?

1:01:15.465 --> 1:01:16.632
Leave.

1:01:19.218 --> 1:01:21.012
When Melissa finds out...
Get her.

1:01:21.929 --> 1:01:23.681
Go ahead and get her.
Tell her whatever you want,

1:01:23.765 --> 1:01:25.224
but right now get out
of my fucking cubicle.

1:02:10.144 --> 1:02:11.479
<i>Fine, we'll take it off,</i>

1:02:11.979 --> 1:02:14.273
<i>but we're talking
about the bailout
and Plouffe's suicide.</i>

1:02:14.357 --> 1:02:15.566
I can't do Plouffe.

1:02:15.650 --> 1:02:17.360
<i>Then we're walking for real.</i>

1:02:17.693 --> 1:02:19.070
<i>Segment producer is pissed
that this is what...</i>

1:02:19.153 --> 1:02:20.863
The guy committed
suicide on national TV.

1:02:20.947 --> 1:02:22.073
It's out of
respect for his family.

1:02:22.156 --> 1:02:23.533
Trust me,
I'm doing you a favor.

1:02:23.616 --> 1:02:24.909
You don't want
to ask about that.

1:02:25.326 --> 1:02:26.953
<i>Please, it's been a month.</i>

1:02:28.704 --> 1:02:30.665
One question,
and I have to approve it.

1:02:33.459 --> 1:02:34.710
Hi, Melissa.

1:02:35.169 --> 1:02:37.547
Bloomberg TV
agreed to all the points
on the exclusive.

1:02:38.506 --> 1:02:40.049
Foster's sending you
the deal memo.

1:02:41.551 --> 1:02:43.344
I need to get coffee
before the staff meeting.

1:04:35.998 --> 1:04:37.333
Sorry I'm late.

1:04:37.750 --> 1:04:39.794
Coming up to the city
was just a nightmare.

1:04:39.877 --> 1:04:41.003
The tunnel was
at a snail's pace.

1:04:41.087 --> 1:04:42.380
E-ZPass is down again.

1:04:42.463 --> 1:04:43.673
They're saying
indefinitely this time,

1:04:43.756 --> 1:04:45.299
but I cannot take
the train in this heat.

1:04:45.383 --> 1:04:47.468
It must have been
in the 90s today.

1:04:47.677 --> 1:04:49.887
Okay, sorry.

1:04:50.346 --> 1:04:51.389
So?

1:04:52.431 --> 1:04:53.975
I've decided to stay.

1:04:55.935 --> 1:04:57.186
We agreed to discuss this.

1:04:57.270 --> 1:04:59.063
We have for several weeks now.

1:05:01.065 --> 1:05:02.400
Need I remind you
I was against you

1:05:02.483 --> 1:05:04.277
taking Colby's job offer
in the first place?

1:05:04.360 --> 1:05:06.112
And then even
when you convinced me

1:05:06.195 --> 1:05:07.905
that we should wait to see
where it would lead,

1:05:07.989 --> 1:05:10.825
we agreed it was only gonna be
for a brief trial basis.

1:05:10.908 --> 1:05:13.202
I think we were both clearly
wrong about their motives.

1:05:13.286 --> 1:05:14.495
Oh, I think
you are being naive.

1:05:14.579 --> 1:05:16.622
And I don't think that we need
to have these talks anymore.

1:05:17.331 --> 1:05:19.292
I like my job,
and I'm not quitting.

1:05:20.501 --> 1:05:21.752
That's my decision.

1:05:43.774 --> 1:05:45.860
You never had any
intention of leaving, did you?

1:05:48.696 --> 1:05:50.573
I know you think
they're pulling something,

1:05:52.158 --> 1:05:54.368
but that's because
you can't imagine anyone

1:05:54.452 --> 1:05:56.078
ever valuing me
as a real asset,

1:05:57.872 --> 1:05:59.290
when the truth is,

1:05:59.749 --> 1:06:01.917
I've done more for
you and the lawsuit

1:06:02.001 --> 1:06:04.128
than you've ever done
for me or yourself.

1:06:06.881 --> 1:06:08.215
I have value,

1:06:09.342 --> 1:06:12.511
and even though you
don't see it, they do.

1:06:13.179 --> 1:06:17.183
They are barbarians
in $10,000 suits,

1:06:18.351 --> 1:06:20.478
but I see your resolve.

1:06:21.646 --> 1:06:23.189
I know when
to cut my losses.

1:06:32.031 --> 1:06:33.991
A guy walks up to
a woman at a bar.

1:06:34.742 --> 1:06:37.078
He flirts with her.
He makes small talk,

1:06:37.161 --> 1:06:39.455
but the woman insists
she isn't gonna
go home with him.

1:06:39.830 --> 1:06:44.251
Guy says, "What if I offer you
a million dollars
to sleep with me?"

1:06:44.877 --> 1:06:46.921
The woman's never had
a million dollars in her life.

1:06:47.088 --> 1:06:50.132
She stops and considers
the offer very seriously.

1:06:51.008 --> 1:06:53.010
The guy changes
his mind, says,

1:06:53.302 --> 1:06:55.888
"What if I change my offer
to a dollar instead?"

1:06:56.681 --> 1:06:57.973
Woman is aghast.

1:06:58.307 --> 1:07:00.059
"What kind of woman
do you think I am?"

1:07:00.559 --> 1:07:04.647
Guy says,
"We already figured that out.
Now we're just negotiating."

1:07:27.253 --> 1:07:28.587
Are you alone?

1:08:42.953 --> 1:08:46.332
<i>Welcome
to Positive Affirmations
volume three,</i>

1:08:47.500 --> 1:08:49.168
<i>Success and Money.</i>

1:08:52.338 --> 1:08:54.715
<i>You'll hear the affirmations
repeated twice.</i>

1:08:55.382 --> 1:08:59.345
<i>I will leave a space
for you to either repeat
mentally or out loud.</i>

1:09:00.221 --> 1:09:04.350
<i>Please use this on
a consistent basis
to form new neural pathways.</i>

1:09:05.017 --> 1:09:06.185
<i>Good luck.</i>

1:09:08.187 --> 1:09:10.189
<i>I am confident.</i>

1:09:11.398 --> 1:09:13.359
<i>I am confident.</i>

1:09:14.401 --> 1:09:16.153
I am confident.

1:09:19.073 --> 1:09:21.158
<i>My confidence is powerful.</i>

1:09:21.700 --> 1:09:23.369
<i>My confidence is powerful.</i>

1:09:24.370 --> 1:09:26.747
My confidence
is powerful.

1:09:28.082 --> 1:09:30.334
<i>I recognize myself
as exceptional.</i>

1:09:31.252 --> 1:09:33.379
<i>I recognize myself
as exceptional.</i>

1:09:34.338 --> 1:09:37.049
I recognize myself
as exceptional.

1:09:38.259 --> 1:09:40.386
<i>I will follow my dreams
no matter what.</i>

1:09:41.846 --> 1:09:44.056
<i>I will follow my dreams
no matter what.</i>

1:09:54.233 --> 1:09:55.442
Come on, sit down.

1:10:03.075 --> 1:10:06.245
Maxine wanted to
come over and say hi.
She missed you.

1:10:08.038 --> 1:10:10.916
I think the damn dog
might actually like you
more than me.

1:10:12.459 --> 1:10:13.794
See that smile?

1:10:21.802 --> 1:10:25.264
Even though we're
technically not friends,
I told my wife we were,

1:10:26.056 --> 1:10:28.392
was too embarrassed
to say otherwise.

1:10:34.607 --> 1:10:36.233
You know,
you two would get along.

1:10:37.109 --> 1:10:38.611
She likes to ignore me, too.

1:10:39.278 --> 1:10:41.238
Hey, man, I don't
mean to be an asshole,

1:10:41.322 --> 1:10:43.949
but like I said before,
I'm all good.

1:10:52.458 --> 1:10:54.001
Sorry, I actually don't know
why I'm laughing.

1:10:54.126 --> 1:10:56.170
I thought you made
some joke I don't get,

1:10:56.253 --> 1:10:58.172
so I usually just
fake laugh at those,

1:10:59.798 --> 1:11:01.467
but, really, I'm confused.

1:11:03.636 --> 1:11:04.970
I thought we were
on the same page.

1:11:06.305 --> 1:11:07.514
About what?

1:11:09.934 --> 1:11:11.310
When we spoke last night.

1:11:13.646 --> 1:11:15.314
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

1:11:16.649 --> 1:11:18.150
I didn't see you last night.

1:11:32.873 --> 1:11:34.333
You really don't remember.

1:11:44.677 --> 1:11:46.136
You feeling okay, chief?

1:12:06.407 --> 1:12:08.826
<i>That's what the control,
the regimen, the journal,</i>

1:12:08.909 --> 1:12:10.744
<i>my perfectly constructed loop,</i>

1:12:11.036 --> 1:12:12.746
<i>what this whole
thing's been about.</i>

1:12:28.220 --> 1:12:31.015
<i>Last night till this morning,
while I was sleeping,</i>

1:12:31.265 --> 1:12:32.599
<i>I can't account for it,</i>

1:12:32.683 --> 1:12:35.019
<i>a gap in my consciousness,
and somehow he...</i>

1:12:35.102 --> 1:12:37.354
What do they see
when they see you coming?

1:12:39.940 --> 1:12:41.525
<i>And this is why I'm different.</i>

1:12:42.443 --> 1:12:44.611
<i>Sometimes my mask takes over.</i>

1:12:44.778 --> 1:12:46.405
Why did you talk to him?

1:12:49.074 --> 1:12:50.743
Because I'm gonna
make you realize.

1:12:51.744 --> 1:12:52.870
What?

1:12:57.541 --> 1:12:59.209
What will you make me realize?

1:13:06.967 --> 1:13:08.594
That they see me.

1:14:29.716 --> 1:14:30.801
What's so funny?

1:14:30.884 --> 1:14:33.887
We started a movement.
We were meant to lead it.

1:14:33.971 --> 1:14:35.722
Now, get back
on a terminal now.

1:14:35.806 --> 1:14:38.183
Give me what I want
or keep shooting me.

1:14:43.188 --> 1:14:48.318
Tell me where Tyrell is,
or shoot me again

1:14:51.405 --> 1:14:53.532
'cause the only one
it's gonna drive mad is you...

1:14:55.159 --> 1:14:56.326
Not me.

1:15:31.945 --> 1:15:33.447
I'm late for my church group.

1:15:35.282 --> 1:15:36.450
Peace.

1:15:43.373 --> 1:15:45.209
<i>...this time targeting
the Bank of E network</i>

1:15:45.292 --> 1:15:47.586
<i>in an elaborate
ransomware attack.</i>

1:15:47.961 --> 1:15:50.464
<i>The malicious malware targeted
the bank's computer servers</i>

1:15:50.547 --> 1:15:52.799
<i>and spread to
multiple branches
in North America,</i>

1:15:53.091 --> 1:15:55.969
<i>encrypting the data
and rendering
the systems unusable</i>

1:15:56.053 --> 1:15:57.763
<i>unless a ransom was paid.</i>

1:15:58.222 --> 1:16:00.641
<i>This more militant variant
of the hacker collective</i>

1:16:00.724 --> 1:16:03.227
<i>forced Scott Knowles,
the CTO of E Corp,</i>

1:16:03.310 --> 1:16:06.813
<i>to burn $5.9 million
in public view.</i>

1:16:07.481 --> 1:16:10.150
<i>Shortly thereafter pictures
surfaced on social media</i>

1:16:10.234 --> 1:16:12.653
<i>under the name
#OPdailyallowance.</i>

1:16:13.237 --> 1:16:16.073
<i>Now, this is considered
a direct response
to E Corp's unpopular program,</i>

1:16:16.406 --> 1:16:18.742
<i>which would lower
their daily cash</i>

1:16:18.825 --> 1:16:21.161
<i>withdrawal allowances
for customers to $50.</i>

1:16:22.579 --> 1:16:23.914
Some stunt, huh?

1:16:24.998 --> 1:16:27.918
Everybody's laughing
it off as a dumb prank,

1:16:28.001 --> 1:16:29.836
but these guys know
what they're doing.

1:16:31.255 --> 1:16:34.258
Never thought
that hard cash would
be this valuable right now.

1:16:35.759 --> 1:16:39.096
We're reliving Black Tuesday,
the Great Depression.

1:16:40.264 --> 1:16:42.099
Warning lights were flashing.

1:16:42.182 --> 1:16:44.768
I mean, in the last two years

1:16:45.018 --> 1:16:46.520
the Army Corps
of Engineers,

1:16:46.603 --> 1:16:48.689
the Energy Department,
the State Department,

1:16:48.814 --> 1:16:51.358
and the Office
of Personnel Management

1:16:51.441 --> 1:16:52.693
were all hacked.

1:16:53.610 --> 1:16:55.946
The government claimed
they were boosting security,

1:16:56.029 --> 1:16:57.656
but what came of it?

1:16:59.199 --> 1:17:00.867
The same as 1929.

1:17:03.287 --> 1:17:04.454
Shit hit the fan.

1:17:08.625 --> 1:17:12.296
An act like this
changes people,
changes society.

1:17:13.046 --> 1:17:14.548
I'm just having a drink.

1:17:15.549 --> 1:17:17.801
I'm sorry,

1:17:18.302 --> 1:17:21.013
and I'm rambling
like a fanatic.

1:17:23.807 --> 1:17:25.559
Is there something else
you want to talk about?

1:17:28.562 --> 1:17:30.147
The beaches of Barbados,

1:17:31.815 --> 1:17:33.900
espresso
on Rue Montmartre,

1:17:35.319 --> 1:17:37.237
sitting around a campfire
in the Adirondacks?

1:17:37.321 --> 1:17:38.488
I'm married.

1:17:40.657 --> 1:17:41.825
I'm Brock...

1:17:44.244 --> 1:17:46.246
And I know
you're Gideon Goddard.

1:17:50.083 --> 1:17:51.585
I watch way too much news.

1:17:51.668 --> 1:17:52.669
God.

1:17:54.004 --> 1:17:55.839
I can't believe I'm
a tabloid sensation.

1:17:56.923 --> 1:17:58.425
More of a diehard fan.

1:18:00.344 --> 1:18:03.055
I got a smile.
I'm on a roll.

1:18:06.725 --> 1:18:07.934
When did he leave you?

1:18:10.020 --> 1:18:11.772
What,
was that on the news, too?

1:18:11.897 --> 1:18:14.191
No, just your face.

1:18:17.736 --> 1:18:19.946
It's obvious why they
use you as their patsy.

1:18:21.365 --> 1:18:26.203
You give off a very
sympathetic, honest vibe.

1:18:27.913 --> 1:18:30.248
You're the perfect
vessel for their lies.

1:18:31.458 --> 1:18:34.378
Yeah, well, I don't
know what to say to that,
but, um...

1:18:36.588 --> 1:18:39.216
I'll agree with you
that it sure as
hell feels like

1:18:39.299 --> 1:18:42.386
there's something
bigger than me in control.

1:18:45.263 --> 1:18:46.598
Thank you.

1:18:47.974 --> 1:18:49.267
For what?

1:18:49.893 --> 1:18:52.104
Tomorrow I'm gonna be a hero.

1:18:56.274 --> 1:18:57.609
I'm sorry?

1:18:58.568 --> 1:19:01.822
You may just be a patsy,
but you're an important one.

1:19:02.614 --> 1:19:04.825
In fact,
I don't think I've ever met

1:19:04.908 --> 1:19:07.077
a bigger crisis actor
than you before.

1:19:11.164 --> 1:19:12.833
This is for our country.

1:20:11.349 --> 1:20:13.018
<i>"And there shall

1:20:13.393 --> 1:20:15.729
"neither sorrow nor crying,

1:20:16.271 --> 1:20:18.899
"neither shall

1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:27.968
Hello?

1:21:30.512 --> 1:21:31.930
<i>Is it really you?</i>

1:21:34.808 --> 1:21:36.017
Who is this?

1:21:39.688 --> 1:21:41.606
Bonsoir <i>Elliot.</i>
