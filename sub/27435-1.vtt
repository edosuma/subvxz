just so that Keen couldn't
identify that skeleton

10:39.170 --> 10:41.229
that he's been lugging around
like his life depended on it.

10:41.270 --> 10:43.864
We've made
a deal with the devil.
It comes at a price.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.935
As for Reddington, when he
gives us a case like this,

10:45.970 --> 10:47.870
we have an obligation
to take it.

10:47.910 --> 10:49.468
Agent Keen,
about the doctor...

10:49.510 --> 10:52.240
Koehler attended
medical school
at Heidelberg University.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.169
Residency in reconstructive
surgery at Johns Hopkins.

10:55.220 --> 10:57.245
He operates
a mobile medical team

10:57.290 --> 11:00.987
that travels the globe
changing the faces
of the criminal elite.

11:01.020 --> 11:03.250
I'm sorry.
Changing their faces?

11:03.290 --> 11:06.157
l__IZ: He is considered
a pioneer In the appIIcatIon

11:06.190 --> 11:08.920
of 3-D computer imaging
and modeling technology.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.393
Don't screw this up.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.761
Dear sir,
when I'm finished,

11:15.800 --> 11:18.303
your own mother
won't know you.

11:18.340 --> 11:21.275
LIZ: According to Reddington,
he and his team were in DC.

11:21.310 --> 11:23.107
Operating out of a bakery
in Petworth

11:23.150 --> 11:24.970
that was undergoing
renovation.

11:25.010 --> 11:27.069
COOPER: Then that's
where we start. Dig in.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.112
Let's see if we can bring this
doctor out of the shadows.

11:30.150 --> 11:31.310
Keen.

11:32.520 --> 11:33.509
A moment?

11:35.690 --> 11:38.523
About what Agent Ressler said.
I share his sentiments.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.358
No matter how fruitful
our arrangement
with Reddington has been,

11:41.400 --> 11:43.868
when I see the price
you continue to pay,

11:43.900 --> 11:46.164
I can't honestly say
it's been worth it.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.497
And I want you to know,

11:47.540 --> 11:49.030
if you don't want
to keep paying it,

11:49.070 --> 11:50.662
I'll shut
the Task Force down.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.302
You said it yourself, sir.

11:52.340 --> 11:54.729
If that doctor is here,
we have to take this case.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.600
There will always be
a case, Elizabeth.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.107
_And no matter
how Important they seem,

11:58.150 --> 12:00.710
none is as important
as you protecting yourself.

12:00.750 --> 12:02.809
Will you think about it?
Of course.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.881
Sir.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.582
After all these years,
I think you can
call me Harold.

12:09.260 --> 12:10.386
Harold.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.395
Thank you, sir.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.263
(CLICKS)

12:24.710 --> 12:27.031
WOMAN: All right.
Up and to the right.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.140
Down and to the left.
Hmm.

12:30.180 --> 12:31.374
(CLICKS)

12:32.920 --> 12:34.171
So?

12:34.220 --> 12:35.812
You are the picture
of health.

12:35.850 --> 12:38.182
Weeks ago,
your body temperature
was 66 degrees.

12:38.220 --> 12:41.257
Your pupils were dilated
and unreactive to light.

12:41.290 --> 12:42.928
In short, you were gone.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.484
Well, I had
remarkable doctors

12:44.530 --> 12:46.020
and a lot of people
praying for me.

12:46.060 --> 12:47.550
Well, their prayers
were answered.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.056
Your CT scan is clear.

12:49.100 --> 12:51.193
Your physical and neurological
exams were normal.

12:51.230 --> 12:52.492
Am I Cleared for duty?

12:52.530 --> 12:55.567
You are. Unless ther_e's
somethIng you've notIced.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.862
Like what?

12:56.910 --> 12:59.663
Hmm, abnormality
in speech or memory?

12:59.710 --> 13:03.601
Have you been forgetful,
unable to recall
certaIn words?

13:04.050 --> 13:06.245
Nothing? Okay.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.444
Welcome back.

13:12.650 --> 13:15.551
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
LUCINDA: I have
a grand Opening tomorrow.

13:16.390 --> 13:17.550
You the ones in charge?

13:17.590 --> 13:20.127
Agents Ressler and Keen, FBI.
You must be the owner.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.491
Yeah. You're damn right
I'm the owner.

13:21.530 --> 13:22.895
My attorney's on her way now.

13:22.930 --> 13:24.625
(SCOFFS)
This is a joke.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.888
An absolute abuse
of pOIIce power.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.237
Okay, ma'am, slow down.

13:28.270 --> 13:29.737
What? (STU'I'I'ERS)
Don't "ma'am" me.
I'm not that old.

13:29.770 --> 13:31.135
I'm_sure as hell
not runnIng some mm of

13:31.170 --> 13:33.206

out of my kitchen.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.730
Well, our intel
says otherwise.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.600
We've been closed down
for plumbing problems.

13:36.640 --> 13:37.709
The grand re-opening
is tomorrow.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.775
I've got 1,200 cupcakes
to make, bake, and frost,

13:39.810 --> 13:41.448
and you're acting like
it's the county morgue!

13:41.480 --> 13:43.744
We're finished here.
We've gone through it twice.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.246
There's no trace evidence.

13:45.290 --> 13:46.314
That can't be.

13:46.350 --> 13:47.817
LUCINDA: Yeah? He just said
it was, handsome.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.589
So can I have
my busmess back?

13:49.620 --> 13:52.123
No. I want you and your team
to tear the place apart...

13:52.160 --> 13:54.424
Every drain trap,
sewage line, air filter.

13:54.460 --> 13:55.893
Swab every inch.

13:55.930 --> 13:59.320
I'm afraid those, uh, cupcakes
are gonna have to wait. Ma'am.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.767
(SCOFFS)

14:05.170 --> 14:07.229
HANS:
This last procedure,

14:07.280 --> 14:09.373
it's just what
we were hoping for.

14:10.810 --> 14:12.346
Would you care to see?

14:23.090 --> 14:26.184
(LAUGHS)

14:26.660 --> 14:28.218
Beautiful.

14:31.870 --> 14:34.134
The bakery. We have a lead.
REDDINGTON: On Koehler?

14:34.170 --> 14:37.469
No, on one of his former
patients. Basil Vladakis.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.466
Basil Vladakis. Dear Lord.

14:39.510 --> 14:41.307
I haven't_ heard
hIs name In ages.

14:41.340 --> 14:44.309
Evidence Response found
trace amounts of blood
in the drain line.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.477
We ran the DNA,
and it matches Vladakis.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.046
Who could lead us
to Dr. Koehler.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.672
If only we knew what
he looks like now.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.188
Apparently he got himself
a new face.

14:52.220 --> 14:54.484
Changing a man's face
is one thing.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.715
Changing his predilections?
Quite another.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.022
His predilections?

14:58.060 --> 15:01.223
Basil Vladakis was a vicious
and wanton gunrunner

15:01.260 --> 15:04.161
whose love of money
was only rivaled

15:04.200 --> 15:06.794
by his love for losing it
at the track.

15:06.830 --> 15:08.388
So you know this guy.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.431
REDDINGTON: I know he was
a regular punter at Mardale.

15:10.470 --> 15:12.734
Perhaps Dembe and I should
be Off to the races

15:12.770 --> 15:15.034
to see if we can't
scare up The Mad Greek.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.504
I certainly wasn't
the only one he stiffed
before Skipping town,

15:18.550 --> 15:19.869
but I'd still like
my money back.

15:19.910 --> 15:22.572
And if he knows anything
about Dr. Koehler's
whereabouts,

15:22.620 --> 15:24.747
well, then, as they say,
"two birds."

15:24.790 --> 15:26.143
Dembe, this could be fun.

15:26.190 --> 15:28.988
We haven't been to a race

15:29.020 --> 15:30.749

at Belmont.

to smile on us after all.

15:37.630 --> 15:40.235

I just hit
the across-the-board
on Salsa Marimba!

15:48.380 --> 15:51.577
REDDINGTON:
Is the across-the-board
really the wisest bet?

15:51.610 --> 15:53.009
As I understand it,

15:53.050 --> 15:56.713
they're expensive and have
far less profit potential.

15:56.750 --> 15:57.785
Is that true?

15:57.820 --> 16:00.050
I wouldn't know.
I'm a nOVIce.

16:00.090 --> 16:01.955
Today must be
my lucky day.

16:01.990 --> 16:04.220
(LAUGHS) It's funny.

16:04.260 --> 16:06.728
You look like an old pro
with a new face.

16:06.760 --> 16:09.558
The kind who likes taking
other people's money.

16:09.600 --> 16:13.138
I once knew
a Greek arms dealer
who took my money.

16:13.170 --> 16:14.569
DO you know how many times
I've stood

16:14.600 --> 16:17.137
in this lousy sports bar
looking for you?

16:17.170 --> 16:19.764
Clever to have your face
reorganized.

16:19.810 --> 16:21.300
Looks good. Cute nose.

16:21.340 --> 16:24.047
Okay.
Look, Mr. Reddington.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.878
I'm sorry.
I'll get you your money.

16:26.910 --> 16:29.310
But I can't be seen here.
Not with you.

16:29.350 --> 16:31.818
If anyone sees us, it would...
Blow your cover?

16:31.850 --> 16:33.954
(LAUGHS) That's about
to happen very quickly.

16:33.990 --> 16:35.150
Can you imagine?

16:35.190 --> 16:37.181
After all that
nipping and tucking,

16:37.230 --> 16:39.050
the sucking and plucking.

16:39.090 --> 16:42.799
All that goes into
changing a man's face,

16:42.830 --> 16:45.321
creating a new identity,
a new life,

16:45.370 --> 16:49.067
then be outed by some old pal
at the same Old racetrack?

16:49.100 --> 16:51.830
What a colossal waste
of money and tIme.

16:51.870 --> 16:54.100
I'll get you your money!
Of course you will.

16:54.140 --> 16:57.576
_ But I'll need
a lIttle somethIng else
to sweeten the pot,

16:57.610 --> 16:59.407
make up for lost interest.

16:59.450 --> 17:01.077
What? What do you want?

17:01.120 --> 17:02.473
I want you
to put me in touch

17:02.520 --> 17:04.511
with the friend
who fixed your face.

17:04.550 --> 17:06.381
We don't Speak.

17:06.420 --> 17:07.956
That's not how it works.

17:07.990 --> 17:09.218
But you know
how to reach him.

17:09.260 --> 17:12.821
All I've got is a number.
For a nurse.

17:12.860 --> 17:17.229
A number to call only in case
of medical emergency.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.124
Then start dialing,
because if you don't,

17:19.170 --> 17:20.797
you're gonna be naked
and penniless

17:20.840 --> 17:23.331
in this lousy sports bar
at Mardale.

17:29.180 --> 17:31.148
JENNIFER: Hey.
I went through your box,

17:31.180 --> 17:32.738
and I think I may have
found something.

17:32.780 --> 17:34.179
I think Reddington knows.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.176
What? How?
I don't know.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.848
And I'm not sure he does.
But this case he gave us...

17:38.890 --> 17:41.552
He's got us hunting down
a plastic surgeon

17:41.590 --> 17:44.229
who performs facial
reconstructions on criminals.

17:44.260 --> 17:46.455
You think Reddington
wants you to find the doctor

17:46.490 --> 17:47.627
that changed his identity?

17:47.660 --> 17:48.820
Why would he want that?

17:48.860 --> 17:50.191
I have no idea.

17:50.230 --> 17:52.528
But _it can't be
a COInCIdence, rIght?

17:52.570 --> 17:54.060
And if this is
Reddington's doctor,

17:54.100 --> 17:55.965
he might have the answer
we're looking for.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.900
So we've got to find him
before Reddington does.

17:59.570 --> 18:02.175
So... So, this is
what I found.

18:02.210 --> 18:05.338
Yeah. I was taken
to a motel in Dover
the night of the fire.

18:05.380 --> 18:07.314
But I went there.
It's a dead end.

18:07.350 --> 18:10.888
The motel maybe. Or Dover.
But not Delaware.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.842
My parents
used to take me there
every summer.

18:12.890 --> 18:15.188
To a house they'd rent
an hour outside Dover

18:15.220 --> 18:17.256
in Rehoboth Beach.
So?

18:17.290 --> 18:20.726
So maybe our father,
the real Raymond Reddington,
took you there.

18:20.760 --> 18:21.829
It was the dead Of winter.

18:21.860 --> 18:23.691
_ Rehoboth Beach
IS a summer resort.

18:23.730 --> 18:25.698
It's the perfect place
to hide.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.061
I'll run a check.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.398
See if there was a fire
in Rehoboth Beach that night.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.067
I already did.

the Daily Double

would be a smart bet?
Yes!

a smart bet.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.088
Mr. Hunt.
What's going on here?

19:33.130 --> 19:36.497
I asked Mr. Hunt
to page you,
not for himself,

19:36.540 --> 19:39.259
but because I'm one
of Dr. Koehler's

19:39.310 --> 19:41.437

and I need to get in touch

19:41.480 --> 19:43.277

I know who you are.
Ah!

19:45.210 --> 19:46.746
Then you know I'm serious

19:46.780 --> 19:49.271
when I say it's a matter
of some urgency.

19:49.320 --> 19:52.016
Dr. Koehler's traveling.
He's in France on holiday.

19:52.050 --> 19:53.119
Until when?

19:53.150 --> 19:54.788

Then he shows up
on a camera in Gdansk

31:58.850 --> 32:00.499
and is ID'd as Moreau.

32:00.550 --> 32:03.542
Which explains his
sudden urge to pay
a visit on Dr. Makeover.

32:04.720 --> 32:07.143
One of the world's
deadliest assassins

32:07.190 --> 32:10.853
is now one of the world's
most anonymous men.

32:10.890 --> 32:13.882
Which means he can act
with impunity.

32:13.930 --> 32:15.898
Whatever he is up to...

32:18.000 --> 32:21.094
I fear Dr. Koehler
is only the beginning.

32:33.280 --> 32:36.044
The Feds have Gabin's body.
They'll connect him to you.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.548
(LAUGHS) To who I was.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.410
Not to who I am.

32:40.450 --> 32:45.228
The assignment remains.
This changes nothing.

32:45.260 --> 32:47.319
We travel as planned.

32:49.260 --> 32:51.296
Well, at least

32:51.330 --> 32:53.389
I travel as planned.

32:53.430 --> 32:55.193
(SILENCED GUNSHOTS)

33:24.070 --> 33:25.890
ARAM: All right.
The Corsican
is a gun for hire.

33:25.930 --> 33:27.420
But not by just anyone.

33:27.470 --> 33:29.791
He has a very particular
clientele.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.604
The Tamil Tigers.
The Kosovo Liberation Army.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.130
He's a nationalist
who works on behalf

33:34.180 --> 33:36.307
of groups fighting
against globalism.

33:36.340 --> 33:39.275
His targets have included
a UNESCO office in Geneva,

33:39.310 --> 33:40.846
a conference center in Davos,

33:40.880 --> 33:43.019
and the European Union
headquarters in The Hague,

33:43.050 --> 33:46.019
where last year a bomb
was defused moments before

33:46.050 --> 33:47.847
the General Assembly's
Opening session.

33:47.890 --> 33:49.517
Before now, everything
has been overseas.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.016
RESSLER:
Well, his next target
could be here

33:51.060 --> 33:52.584
or maybe he's already
left the country.

33:52.630 --> 33:53.858
COOPER:
Can't lock down
the airports.

33:53.890 --> 33:55.596
We have no idea
who we're looking for.

33:55.630 --> 33:57.257
The Corsican,
as bad as he may be,

33:57.300 --> 33:59.598
is only one name on
Dr. Koehler's client list.

33:59.630 --> 34:01.495
Shouldn't we be focused
on finding the list?

34:01.540 --> 34:03.997
We may not know
what this guy looks like,
but thanks to Samar

34:04.040 --> 34:06.600
shooting out his taillight,
we were able to trace his car.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.972
First day back, and you're
already showing us up.

34:09.010 --> 34:11.501
It was found in a remote lot
at Reagan InternatIonal.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.700
There were two bodies
identified at the scene

34:13.750 --> 34:16.639
matching the men
you saw driving away
in The Corsican's car.

34:16.680 --> 34:17.840
Why would he kill
his own people?

34:17.880 --> 34:19.745
LIZ:
Same reason he killed
Koehler and his team...

34:19.790 --> 34:21.212
They knew what he looked like.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.114
They were the only
remaining ones who did.

34:23.160 --> 34:25.378
Aram, pull every feed
from that lot you can find.

34:25.430 --> 34:27.386
If you get a hit,
circulate it to TSA.

34:27.430 --> 34:30.627
We'll find that list,
but right now we've got
an emergency on our hands.

34:30.660 --> 34:33.060
Get to Reagan, coordinate
with Airport Authority Police,

34:33.100 --> 34:34.795
tell them we've got
a situation.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.058
WOMAN: All right, sir.
Thanks.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.704
Wait there, ma'am.

34:38.740 --> 34:41.208
RESSLER: Two minutes out.
SAMAR: Moreau, Bastien.

34:41.240 --> 34:43.879
I need you to notify security
he's on site and...

34:43.910 --> 34:45.400
Yes, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

34:45.450 --> 34:46.872
No, I do not have
a positive ID,

34:46.910 --> 34:48.810
but you need to put
the facility on lockdown

34:48.850 --> 34:50.579
and hold all passengers.

34:50.620 --> 34:52.019
MAN: (ON RADIO)
Code three, all responders.

34:52.050 --> 34:54.257
White male. Mid-50$.
May be armed...

34:54.290 --> 34:55.848
Sir, I'm terribly sorry.

34:55.890 --> 35:00.020
Can we please stop
at the men's room
before gettIng to my gate?

35:00.060 --> 35:01.493
Of course, Sir.
Not a problem.

35:01.530 --> 35:02.519
Thank you.

35:03.960 --> 35:05.689
WOMAN: (ON PA)
We ask for your assistance

35:05.730 --> 35:07.721
in reporting
any unattended bags.

35:07.770 --> 35:09.237
Lock it down.
All points of exit.

35:09.270 --> 35:11.761
Drop-off, pick-up,
parking garages, everywhere.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.699
Agent Navabi, FBI.
I need you take me
to your CD.

35:14.740 --> 35:17.436
I need every male passenger
searched, ID'd,

35:17.480 --> 35:18.879
and taken to
a secure area.

35:18.910 --> 35:21.674
Where are your
security feeds?
Over here.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.415
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

35:26.590 --> 35:29.684
Sir! We need you right away.
We got something.

35:32.890 --> 35:34.494
MAN: (ON RADIO) All units,
suspect is impersonating

35:34.530 --> 35:36.748
an airport employee
in a maroon blazer.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.862
MAN: (ON RADIO)
Attention, all units.

35:43.900 --> 35:45.959
...white male suspect...

35:47.770 --> 35:50.409
(DOOR CLOSES)

36:02.160 --> 36:04.151
(ENGINE STARTS)

36:11.330 --> 36:12.729
Yes?

36:12.770 --> 36:14.328
Mrs. Koehler,

36:14.370 --> 36:16.998
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.107
How did...

36:20.310 --> 36:21.334
Who are you?

36:21.380 --> 36:24.440
A friend of your husband's.
My name is Raymond.

36:24.480 --> 36:26.675
I'm here for the Picasso.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.346
REDDINGTON: Well.
This is unexpected.

36:33.390 --> 36:35.654
Why would Hans
want you to take him?

36:35.690 --> 36:38.352
He loved Picasso.

36:38.390 --> 36:41.553
How much do you know about
your husband's line of work?

36:41.600 --> 36:42.828
He was a great surgeon.

36:42.860 --> 36:45.795
He was away for months
at a time, wasn't he?

36:45.830 --> 36:47.718
He had clients
all over the world.

36:47.770 --> 36:48.794
He did.

36:49.740 --> 36:52.208
Many of those clients
were...

36:53.710 --> 36:55.200
Criminals.

36:55.240 --> 36:59.040
Some Of them terrible men
and terrible women.

36:59.080 --> 37:01.674
That's not so.
It Is.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.348
I should know.
I'm one of them.

37:20.900 --> 37:21.889
What is that?

37:22.570 --> 37:24.663
Your husband's
client list.

37:24.710 --> 37:27.008
That's what you came for.
Yes.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.837
And to give you this.

37:31.450 --> 37:35.341
It's a numbered bank account
with $5 million in it.

37:35.380 --> 37:38.315
And also the name of a man
who's standing by

37:38.350 --> 37:40.489
to create your
false identification.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.511
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
I don't understand.

37:42.560 --> 37:45.154
Other_clients will come
lookIng for thIs lIst.

37:45.190 --> 37:47.249
I don't know
how many or when.

37:47.290 --> 37:48.996
Just that they will.

37:49.030 --> 37:51.396
And you do not want to
be here when they do.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.963
Why are you doing this?

37:56.470 --> 37:59.667
As I said,
Hans was a friend of mine.

37:59.710 --> 38:02.804
I wouldn't be the person I am
if it weren't for him.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.441
I recommend Cairo.

38:08.480 --> 38:10.619
Beautiful, historic.

38:10.650 --> 38:12.186
And thanks to a combination

38:12.220 --> 38:16.213
of the Muslim Brotherhood
and international
Islamophobia,

38:16.260 --> 38:19.684
completely abandoned
by Western tourists.

38:19.730 --> 38:22.722
You and Picasso will have
the pyramIds to yourselves.

38:23.930 --> 38:26.398
COOPER: SO let me get this
straight. We lost Moreau.

38:26.430 --> 38:29.263
He slipped security
using the identity
of an airline rep.

38:29.300 --> 38:31.234
Security feeds
show him stealing a car

38:31.270 --> 38:32.464
from an employee parking lot.

38:32.510 --> 38:33.932
We have word out
on the vehicle now.

38:33.970 --> 38:35.608
COOPER: Any hits?
ARAM: Not yet.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.234
So he's gone,
and Koehler is dead,

38:38.280 --> 38:39.872
and the names of his clients
died with him.

38:39.910 --> 38:42.071
LIZ: All except Moreau.
COOPER: Who's God knows where

38:42.120 --> 38:43.940
and about to do
God knows what.

38:43.980 --> 38:47.086
Reddington never wanted us
to catch Koehler.

38:47.120 --> 38:48.417
Any chance he told you
what it was?

38:48.460 --> 38:50.712
(SCOFFS)
No. He didn't.

38:55.130 --> 38:56.757
Did you think about
what I said...

38:56.800 --> 39:00.497
About the price and whether
you're willing to pay it?
I did.

39:00.530 --> 39:02.589
And have you made a decision?

39:02.640 --> 39:05.609
The Raymond Reddington
we know can't be trusted.

39:06.440 --> 39:08.431
But there was
another Reddington.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.708
Another Reddington?

39:11.140 --> 39:13.472
It's hard to explain,

39:13.510 --> 39:15.569
but I want to know how
the Reddington we could trust

39:15.620 --> 39:17.679
turned into the one
we can't.

39:18.390 --> 39:20.142
I have to know.

39:20.790 --> 39:22.052
Whatever the price.

39:23.560 --> 39:27.280
* Turnunders and overpasses

39:28.830 --> 39:33.529
* Directions change,
and you are different today

39:33.570 --> 39:35.162
* What do you want?

39:35.200 --> 39:36.360
Ah.

39:38.670 --> 39:42.834
* Oh, what do you want?

39:42.880 --> 39:44.677
I meant what I said before

39:44.710 --> 39:47.508
about our relationship
being symbiotic.

39:48.380 --> 39:51.178
I help you, you help me.

39:51.220 --> 39:52.517
We help each other.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.210
What's this?

39:55.260 --> 39:57.353
An insurance policy.

39:57.390 --> 40:00.052
Dr. Koehler was not only
a gifted surgeon,

40:00.090 --> 40:02.524
but also a man smart enough
to know that his life

40:02.560 --> 40:06.860
was threatened by
the very men and women
who paid for his services.

40:06.900 --> 40:08.891
For that reason,
he kept a dossier...

40:08.940 --> 40:11.738
A list of every face
he changed.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.101
Moreau knew about this.

40:14.140 --> 40:17.507
Which is why he abducted
Dr. Koehler and his team

40:18.340 --> 40:21.173
and forced them_
to operate at gunpOInt.

40:21.210 --> 40:23.610
Which means his new identity
won't be on this drive.

40:23.650 --> 40:25.186
No.

40:25.220 --> 40:27.484
But the names of
countless others are.

40:27.520 --> 40:30.751
Men and women who abandoned
their lives to hide.

40:31.460 --> 40:32.449
Now you can find them.

40:34.190 --> 40:37.023
Where to find this...

40:37.060 --> 40:40.188
That's what Dr. Koehler
whispered to you
before he died.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.430
I told you mine.
Now you tell me yours.

40:45.310 --> 40:46.368
I would.

40:46.410 --> 40:49.072
But you haven't
really told me
yours yet, have you?

40:49.110 --> 40:50.771
Not all of it.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.445
This isn't the _
complete |Ist, Is It?

40:56.750 --> 40:58.047
No, it's not.

40:59.090 --> 41:01.183
One file
has been deleted.

41:01.220 --> 41:02.619
Yours.

41:03.220 --> 41:04.756
(SIGHS)

41:04.790 --> 41:07.782
I prefer to keep my nips
and tucks to myself.

41:08.930 --> 41:11.626
Forgive an Old man
his vanity.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.063
For now, but...

41:14.100 --> 41:16.398
Someday I want to see
the before
and after pIctures.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.362
(LAUGHS)

41:18.400 --> 41:19.708
Not a pretty sight.

41:23.310 --> 41:25.005
I'm sure you were
always handsome.

41:26.180 --> 41:27.408
Was I?

41:29.350 --> 41:31.113
I can't remember.

41:31.150 --> 41:33.289
* And you are
different today

41:33.320 --> 41:34.651
Neither can I.

41:34.690 --> 41:38.478
* What do you want
for your love?

41:38.530 --> 41:40.828
But I don't have to.

41:41.330 --> 41:42.752
I know that...

41:44.630 --> 41:45.995
Before
everything changed...

41:46.030 --> 41:49.568
* Turnunders and overpasses

41:49.600 --> 41:51.295
...my father was...

41:51.340 --> 41:53.137
* Directions Change

41:53.170 --> 41:55.274
...kind and decent...

41:55.310 --> 41:56.629
And beautiful.

41:56.680 --> 41:59.274
* What do you want
for your heart?

41:59.910 --> 42:01.309
Inside and out.

42:01.350 --> 42:06.287
* What do you want
for your heart?

42:07.790 --> 42:10.850
* What do you want?

42:15.560 --> 42:20.862
* Oh, what do you want? *
