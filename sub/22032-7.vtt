00:19.982 --> 00:21.750
Evening, William.

00:21.785 --> 00:24.086
Mutton, potato, and cabbage, sir,

00:24.121 --> 00:26.126
with bread.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.063
Thank you.

00:28.097 --> 00:29.797
Oh, General.

00:29.832 --> 00:33.841
The northern post rider said latest he
ought to leave for Connecticut is midnight

00:33.876 --> 00:35.945

No pain?

02:17.625 --> 02:19.729
- None.
- Good.

02:19.763 --> 02:22.397
Very good. You may get dressed.

02:22.431 --> 02:25.566
The good news is that
physically you're fine.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.040
<i>There's no sign of typhus or typhoid fever,</i>

02:29.074 --> 02:30.875
<i>pneumonia or scurvy.</i>

02:30.909 --> 02:33.812
None of the ailments
currently afflicting the camp.

02:33.846 --> 02:35.883
There's also no reoccurrence

02:35.917 --> 02:38.452
of the malaria from your youth.

02:38.487 --> 02:40.888
And you've already had the pox.

02:40.922 --> 02:42.893
I suffered from pleurisy as well.

02:42.927 --> 02:45.063
It often saps the strength in my voice.

02:45.097 --> 02:48.265
Well, percussion has ruled out

02:48.299 --> 02:50.702
inflammation of the lungs as well.

02:50.736 --> 02:53.805
Any other history of illness
I should be aware of?

02:53.839 --> 02:58.643
My half-brother Lawrence
died from the white plague.

03:00.172 --> 03:02.305
- Age at death?
- 34.

03:02.339 --> 03:04.205
Hmm.

03:04.239 --> 03:07.539
Well, based on your symptoms,

03:07.574 --> 03:10.472
<i>visions and sounds of objects not present,</i>

03:10.506 --> 03:12.640
I'm forced to conclude
that you have developed

03:12.674 --> 03:14.808
a case of acute melancholia.

03:16.679 --> 03:19.852
It is an ailment that
originates not in the body,

03:19.887 --> 03:21.353
but in the soul.

03:21.387 --> 03:23.957
Now, there are two strains of the malady...

03:23.991 --> 03:26.160
<i>Unnatural and natural.</i>

03:26.195 --> 03:29.733
The former is caused by demonic possession.

03:29.768 --> 03:32.804
Natural melancholy is far more common.

03:32.838 --> 03:35.341
It is brought on by a deep

03:35.376 --> 03:37.509
moral conflict within the soul.

03:37.544 --> 03:42.344
<i>This illness can be quite
severe if not properly treated.</i>

03:42.380 --> 03:44.081
How so?

03:44.115 --> 03:46.482
In the most extreme cases, the...

03:46.516 --> 03:48.717
Yes?

03:49.786 --> 03:52.021
The patient succumbs to madness.

03:53.391 --> 03:55.394
<i>His Excellency should
get a full night's rest.</i>

03:55.428 --> 03:57.363
Much obliged, Doctor.

04:01.936 --> 04:04.039
Doctor.

04:04.073 --> 04:07.944
If anyone asks, it wasn't
me you came to see.

04:07.979 --> 04:10.641
Billy has a pain in his back

04:10.676 --> 04:13.544
<i>from when he was kicked by a horse.</i>

04:13.579 --> 04:16.113
Uh, of course.

04:16.148 --> 04:17.714
Yes.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.084
I'll brew you that tea and then we'll get...

04:22.119 --> 04:23.519
- Coffee.
- Sir?

04:23.554 --> 04:26.421
We're going to resolve this matter tonight.

04:26.456 --> 04:27.755
We?

04:27.789 --> 04:31.522
William, do you know
what a moral conflict is?

04:31.557 --> 04:32.857
No, sir.

04:32.891 --> 04:35.291
It occurs when one's most
deeply held convictions

04:35.326 --> 04:37.859
do not match one's actions.

04:37.893 --> 04:39.461
All right.

04:39.495 --> 04:41.631
Prior to my melancholic attack,

04:41.665 --> 04:43.867
do you remember what I was doing?

04:43.901 --> 04:45.468
You had just sat down to dinner.

04:45.502 --> 04:46.536
Yes, and just before that?

04:46.570 --> 04:48.772
I came in, set down the plate,

04:48.806 --> 04:51.109
and I told you about
the northern post rider.

04:51.143 --> 04:54.142
Said the latest he can leave
camp tonight is midnight.

04:58.880 --> 05:02.249
There's a piece of correspondence I
have delayed sending for several weeks.

05:02.284 --> 05:04.252
It's an execution order.

05:04.286 --> 05:06.553
Execution? For who?

05:06.587 --> 05:09.055
A royal officer held by our forces.

05:09.089 --> 05:12.225
The crime he's committed
most certainly merits death.

05:12.259 --> 05:15.624
Our Connecticut 5th has been
awaiting my instructions for a month.

05:15.658 --> 05:17.862
If they do not hear word by tomorrow,

05:17.897 --> 05:21.732
they'll assume they have my approval
to proceed with the execution.

05:21.767 --> 05:25.338
Well, do they or don't they?

05:28.809 --> 05:32.413
I don't... I don't know.

05:42.529 --> 05:46.097
Clearly something about this
execution order is troubling to me.

05:47.433 --> 05:51.237
I must do whatever it takes to resolve it.

05:54.606 --> 05:56.773
And you will aid me in this pursuit.

05:56.807 --> 05:59.575
<i>Tonight, you are to treat me as an equal.</i>

06:00.977 --> 06:03.547
<i>You are to spare me no quarter.</i>

06:10.521 --> 06:12.289
Read this out loud.

06:13.594 --> 06:15.229
Let me call back the doctor.
He knows better...

06:15.263 --> 06:18.697
No, Thacher knows too much already.

06:18.731 --> 06:23.270
You see, a commander
who suffers from madness

06:23.304 --> 06:27.306
risks the life of every
soldier under his command.

06:27.340 --> 06:29.711
What we discuss here tonight

06:29.745 --> 06:32.548
will determine if I remain in command

06:32.583 --> 06:35.382
of these American forces...

06:35.417 --> 06:39.154
or if I announce my resignation to Congress.

06:42.657 --> 06:44.725
Now go on.

06:48.530 --> 06:52.603
"December 6, 1777.

06:52.637 --> 06:54.539
Dear General,

06:54.573 --> 06:57.407
I am Lieutenant John Chaffee

06:57.441 --> 06:59.309
of the Connecticut 5th.

06:59.343 --> 07:02.816
As you know, my unit
suffered a profound loss

07:02.851 --> 07:07.221
<i>when our Captain McCarrey
was murdered by the enemy.</i>

07:07.256 --> 07:09.123
<i>I'm writing to inform you</i>

07:09.157 --> 07:12.161
<i>that through diligent pursuit</i>

07:12.195 --> 07:15.196
<i>we were able to capture and bring to trial</i>

07:15.231 --> 07:18.563
<i>the British officer responsible,</i>

07:18.598 --> 07:20.099
<i>Major Edmund Hewlett."</i>

07:20.133 --> 07:23.900
No, I will not admit to a
crime that I did not commit.

07:23.935 --> 07:27.433
I did not skulk into your
fort and murder your commander

07:27.467 --> 07:29.267
and neither did my men.

07:29.301 --> 07:31.938
Remember this?

07:31.973 --> 07:34.773
It was inked with our captain's blood.

07:34.808 --> 07:36.141
I am innocent, Lieutenant.

07:36.175 --> 07:37.876
You have made a grievous error.

07:37.911 --> 07:39.945
Cameron, the bag, please.

07:45.183 --> 07:47.185
How about this, hmm?

07:47.220 --> 07:49.184
Our captain's tongue.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.224
- No. No, no, no.
- Did you flinch when you cut it from his mouth?

07:52.258 --> 07:54.861
Then impaled it on his desk for us to find?

07:54.895 --> 07:56.795
No, no, no.

07:56.829 --> 08:00.034
Was he alive? Or did you defile his corpse

08:00.068 --> 08:02.534
- to strike terror into our hearts?
- No, no! A thousand times no!

08:02.568 --> 08:04.335
I am an officer and a gentleman,

08:04.368 --> 08:06.500
but above all, I'm a child of God.

08:06.535 --> 08:10.403
I could never inflict such horror on
the body of a man alive or dead.

08:10.437 --> 08:12.672
But I did not commit these terrible deeds.

08:12.706 --> 08:15.074
Only a demon could enact the
scenario you've recounted.

08:15.109 --> 08:17.376
- A demon, you say?
- Yes, a monster of pure evil.

08:17.411 --> 08:20.012
Then renounce it. Cast it out.

08:20.046 --> 08:22.846
Confess your crimes before God
and salvation will be yours.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.549
- Are you mad?
- Bastard!

08:24.583 --> 08:27.852
Not yet. Not yet.

08:27.886 --> 08:29.719
Soon.

08:29.754 --> 08:33.326
Major Hewlett, I pronounce
you guilty of murder.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.929
Please, I swear to God

08:35.965 --> 08:38.033
and by all that is holy, I am innocent.

08:38.068 --> 08:40.804
I am... ( groaning )

08:43.308 --> 08:47.080
You don't deserve to
wear these or any colors.

08:48.681 --> 08:51.282
There are rules! There is common decency.

08:51.316 --> 08:54.122
I demand to be treated with decency.

08:56.527 --> 08:59.530
- There are rules!
- Not for a demon like you.

08:59.564 --> 09:03.433
( Whimpering )

09:13.845 --> 09:15.612
So what's the problem?

09:15.646 --> 09:17.646
Don't you want this man executed?

09:24.118 --> 09:28.416
This is the last report prepared by
Major Tallmadge before he departed.

09:28.450 --> 09:32.885
It's based on a letter from a female
intelligencer on Long Island.

09:33.986 --> 09:35.719
Go on.

09:35.753 --> 09:40.088
"General Washington, I'm saddened to report

09:40.122 --> 09:43.058
that our signal agent in Setauket

09:43.092 --> 09:46.896
has written to say that
on the 1st of December

09:46.930 --> 09:51.034
our man Culper was captured
by the royal authorities

09:51.068 --> 09:53.505
while on assignment in York City

09:53.539 --> 09:56.073
and charged with espionage."

09:57.743 --> 09:58.810
Continue.

09:58.844 --> 10:02.846
"As far as we know, Culper is still alive

10:02.880 --> 10:06.184
and being held at Livingston's
sugar house prison."

10:06.184 --> 10:12.954
__

10:21.302 --> 10:23.403
Please, God.

10:24.773 --> 10:27.375
Please hear me. Hear me.

10:28.610 --> 10:32.245
( Muttering ) I was not open with my family.

10:32.280 --> 10:33.916
Man: Woodhull.

10:48.103 --> 10:51.638
Go slow or you'll bring it back up.

10:51.672 --> 10:55.042
Name's Gareth. And you're Woodhull?

10:59.478 --> 11:01.612
I'm Abraham.

11:01.646 --> 11:04.417
Father of the Hebrews.

11:04.452 --> 11:06.520
Guard: <i>Spread out. Spread out.</i>

11:06.554 --> 11:09.824
How did two God-fearing men like
ourselves end up in a sugar house?

11:12.194 --> 11:14.730
Assaulting a king's officer.

11:14.764 --> 11:18.969
Bollocks. All's I did was tell
a man to unhand my sister.

11:19.004 --> 11:20.639
She's 11.

11:20.674 --> 11:22.274
Been like a father to her all her life

11:22.308 --> 11:24.240
and now she's got no one.

11:27.912 --> 11:29.412
Sorry.

11:31.981 --> 11:34.350
What about you?

11:34.384 --> 11:37.122
They don't lock up Tories
unless it's serious.

11:38.792 --> 11:40.526
I was caught somewhere I
shouldn't have been caught

11:40.560 --> 11:42.528
carrying something I
shouldn't have been carrying.

11:42.562 --> 11:45.031
Please tell me you're
some kind of Nathan Hale.

11:45.065 --> 11:48.770
Sticking it to the enemy behind their lines.

11:48.804 --> 11:50.869
Give me some reason for hope.

11:53.370 --> 11:55.069
No...

11:55.104 --> 11:58.305
I'm just one man in the city trying
to do something right, that's all.

12:02.011 --> 12:04.547
Thank you.

12:04.582 --> 12:06.149
Yeah.

12:13.258 --> 12:16.360
Guard! Take me to Yates.

12:17.596 --> 12:20.133
Mr. Woodhull just confessed he's a spy.

12:25.475 --> 12:29.111
<i>( Men arguing )</i>

12:29.145 --> 12:32.146
Shut up! Shut up, you sordid bastards.

12:32.180 --> 12:34.816
He said that one man in the city could
do as much damage as 1,000 in the field.

12:34.850 --> 12:37.118
- Do not listen to him, sir. He's lying.
- Hold your tongue.

12:40.188 --> 12:42.654
( Sighs ) Do you have proof?

12:42.688 --> 12:45.422
<i>A witness?</i>

12:45.456 --> 12:47.857
No, but you said I would go free

12:47.891 --> 12:49.492
if I got a confession.

12:50.895 --> 12:54.061
Ah, yes, I did.

12:54.961 --> 12:56.661
<i>However,</i>

12:56.695 --> 13:00.532
<i>it takes more than hearsay to hang a man.</i>

13:01.967 --> 13:06.201
Now you're worse than a Tory, Gareth.

13:06.235 --> 13:09.903
You're a conk, a snitch.

13:09.938 --> 13:12.973
<i>You might not even make it
through the night tonight.</i>

13:13.008 --> 13:15.409
Take him back.

13:15.443 --> 13:17.679
- Let's go.
- No! You can't do this!

13:17.713 --> 13:19.881
No! No!

13:19.916 --> 13:22.984
You enjoy this, don't you, huh?

13:23.018 --> 13:25.620
Can I tell you a secret?

13:29.695 --> 13:31.263
I don't believe there's a God in heaven

13:31.298 --> 13:35.134
<i>nor do I believe there's a Devil in hell.</i>

13:35.168 --> 13:38.773
They exist merely in the minds of men.

13:40.609 --> 13:43.045
But...

13:43.079 --> 13:46.783
when a mind is broken...

13:48.417 --> 13:52.122
and a man... ( sniffs )

13:52.157 --> 13:54.761
is stripped down

13:54.795 --> 13:57.997
to his base nature...

13:58.032 --> 13:59.435
Hmm?

13:59.469 --> 14:02.673
Then you can see who he truly is.

14:07.677 --> 14:10.549
It will be with great pleasure

14:10.583 --> 14:14.785
that I finally meet you, Mr. Woodhull.

14:18.559 --> 14:20.527
Get out.

14:22.898 --> 14:24.466
Go on!

14:29.613 --> 14:32.414
Washington: <i>Of all the decisions I make,</i>

14:32.448 --> 14:37.053
it is this one which threatens
my life and our future.

14:38.723 --> 14:42.092
Shall I pardon a brutal murderer

14:42.127 --> 14:45.427
in order to save a failed spy?

14:50.332 --> 14:52.098
What should I do?

14:52.133 --> 14:54.635
You always do the right thing, General.

14:57.508 --> 14:59.775
The right thing?

14:59.809 --> 15:04.581
Was it right to get Nathaniel
Sackett's throat slit?

15:04.615 --> 15:06.283
Or... or to have the king's ledger

15:06.317 --> 15:08.585
fall into the hands of Robert Rogers?

15:08.620 --> 15:11.323
Was it right to lose the French alliance

15:11.357 --> 15:13.125
<i>and the entire bloody war?</i>

15:13.159 --> 15:15.360
But...

15:15.394 --> 15:17.594
But the war ain't lost.

15:21.598 --> 15:25.567
If he could see me now, he'd laugh.

15:25.602 --> 15:27.272
He'd already know what to do.

15:27.306 --> 15:29.173
He'd have done it.

15:31.973 --> 15:34.041
How would he do it?

15:34.075 --> 15:35.544
Have a seat, Billy.

15:35.578 --> 15:38.950
We're going to stir the proverbial pot.

15:38.984 --> 15:41.454
But you can't play whist without four men.

15:41.489 --> 15:44.458
Then let there be two Washingtons

15:44.493 --> 15:46.859
and two William Lees.

15:55.801 --> 15:58.803
My brother Lawrence taught me this game.

15:58.838 --> 16:02.345
He used it to order his thoughts.

16:03.980 --> 16:06.045
Lawrence introduced me

16:06.080 --> 16:10.383
to a world of culture and opportunity.

16:10.418 --> 16:12.551
He taught me how to dance.

16:13.685 --> 16:16.218
( Laughs )

16:18.491 --> 16:20.625
Sort of a rough country boy.

16:20.659 --> 16:22.326
He took me in at Mount Vernon

16:22.361 --> 16:25.995
and fashioned me into a gentleman.

16:26.030 --> 16:29.231
I recall it was I who watched over him

16:29.265 --> 16:30.901
<i>when we went to Barbados</i>

16:30.937 --> 16:34.708
<i>where we hoped to cure his tuberculosis.</i>

16:34.743 --> 16:38.742
- <i> ( distant choir singing )</i>
- Look in my bag, George.

16:41.044 --> 16:43.477
I have something for you.

16:55.290 --> 16:57.024
Lawrence, no. This is your pocket watch.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.491
I can't have your pocket watch.

16:58.525 --> 17:01.257
Yours now.

17:01.291 --> 17:03.428
( Coughing )

17:06.702 --> 17:10.439
<i>Be mindful of time, my brother.</i>

17:10.473 --> 17:12.443
<i>It can easily run out.</i>

17:16.781 --> 17:19.885
Billy: <i> Must have meant a hell of a
lot to him to give you that watch.</i>

17:22.253 --> 17:24.223
I owe him everything.

17:30.230 --> 17:32.831
I taught my brother to play, too,

17:32.865 --> 17:35.766
soon after we was brought to Mount Vernon.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.868
Frank was missing Mama something fierce.

17:38.902 --> 17:41.735
Wouldn't stop crying all through the night.

17:41.770 --> 17:44.402
So I thought teach him a game.

17:44.437 --> 17:46.069
Brighten his spirits.

17:46.103 --> 17:47.604
Is Frank any good?

17:47.638 --> 17:50.438
Hmm, he ain't better than me. ( chuckles )

17:50.473 --> 17:52.740
I seem to recall the Good
Book mentioned something

17:52.775 --> 17:55.376
about pride coming before destruction.

17:55.411 --> 17:58.048
You're right. Sorry, General.

17:59.384 --> 18:01.946
I'm pulling your leg, Billy.

18:01.980 --> 18:03.948
Have another drink.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.657
Barbados rum is the finest.

18:17.966 --> 18:21.037
Counting them cards. Good memory.

18:21.072 --> 18:22.941
I owe my memory to my days

18:22.975 --> 18:26.041
as chief surveyor of Culpeper County.

18:26.075 --> 18:28.210
Another debt I owe Lawrence.

18:28.244 --> 18:31.245
Culpeper. That sound like Culper.

18:33.382 --> 18:36.180
Abraham Woodhull.

18:37.649 --> 18:39.516
That's his real name.

18:41.286 --> 18:46.090
His father is a county
magistrate and a Loyalist.

18:46.124 --> 18:48.359
And he has a wife

18:48.393 --> 18:49.827
and a young son.

18:49.861 --> 18:52.563
His older brother was a captain

18:52.598 --> 18:54.064
in the king's American regiment,

18:54.098 --> 18:57.634
but he died suddenly, tragically.

18:57.668 --> 19:01.304
And so the second son became the first.

19:01.338 --> 19:03.238
Just like you.

19:04.541 --> 19:07.011
I am nothing like Abraham Woodhull.

19:07.046 --> 19:11.015
No, General, you sure
ain't nothing like him.

19:14.454 --> 19:17.657
If you have something to say, say it.

19:20.227 --> 19:23.530
All I meant to say was that
you seem just fine to me.

19:23.565 --> 19:25.864
Dr. Thacher probably
making too much of nothing.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.531
<i>You strong as an ox.</i>

19:27.566 --> 19:30.069
You just having a bad night is all.

19:30.103 --> 19:31.537
It's not just one night.

19:31.572 --> 19:33.672
This has been happening for weeks.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.708
I'm hearing things, seeing things.

19:36.742 --> 19:38.575
Seeing Lawrence.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.876
No, this malady is real,

19:40.910 --> 19:42.475
and I'm not going to let it beat me.

19:42.509 --> 19:45.079
( Pounds table ) I'm going to
fight and I'm going to win.

19:45.113 --> 19:47.748
And I'll be damned if I
allow you to deny me that.

19:47.782 --> 19:50.182
- Deny you?
- I told you to give me no quarter,

19:50.216 --> 19:52.582
but you're throwing the
game, hiding behind lies.

19:52.617 --> 19:55.719
You think I don't see
you counting cards, too?

19:59.521 --> 20:02.157
Clean up this mess.

20:10.233 --> 20:12.002
No.

20:17.476 --> 20:19.311
No horseshit.

20:19.346 --> 20:21.715
That's what you asked for.

20:21.750 --> 20:24.955
Till midnight, you clean up your own mess.

20:45.152 --> 20:48.859
Less than two hours till the post
rider must leave with my answer.

20:50.127 --> 20:53.229
Remember, give me no quarter.

21:09.917 --> 21:13.223
You're playing your two hands with
completely different stratagems.

21:13.257 --> 21:16.961
I imagine one's Frank and one's me.

21:16.995 --> 21:18.964
Why?

21:20.000 --> 21:23.268
'Cause there ain't two Billy Lees.

21:23.303 --> 21:26.372
You need to figure out if
you got two Abe Woodhulls.

21:26.406 --> 21:28.274
A spy and a double.

21:28.309 --> 21:32.277
To figure that out, you
gotta play Abe's hand.

21:33.913 --> 21:35.648
Woodhull hasn't broken.

21:35.682 --> 21:37.685
How do you know?

21:38.920 --> 21:41.488
Because he hasn't been executed.

21:41.522 --> 21:44.958
If he had, we'd have read
it in their gazettes.

21:44.993 --> 21:47.493
For a lawful execution to take place,

21:47.527 --> 21:50.028
one requires sufficient evidence.

21:50.063 --> 21:53.597
Right, and without evidence
you gotta get a confession.

21:53.631 --> 21:55.299
Mmm.

21:55.333 --> 21:58.670
Despite whatever miseries
they've heaped upon him,

21:58.704 --> 22:00.772
Woodhull hasn't succumbed.

22:01.841 --> 22:03.643
Neither did the other one.

22:03.677 --> 22:06.347
- The other one?
- Major Hewlett.

22:06.381 --> 22:08.282
He didn't confess neither, did he?

22:09.619 --> 22:11.254
No, indeed.

22:12.923 --> 22:16.623
Which is why Chaffee sent the second letter.

22:21.632 --> 22:24.499
December 18th. 14 days ago.

22:24.533 --> 22:26.969
"Your Excellency,

22:27.003 --> 22:28.873
it has been two weeks since I wrote to you.

22:28.908 --> 22:31.676
We tried Major Hewlett and found him guilty.

22:31.710 --> 22:33.645
Even though he refuses to confess,

22:33.680 --> 22:37.016
there is no doubt he is lying.

22:37.051 --> 22:40.288
All I require is permission
to see justice done

22:40.322 --> 22:42.091
and Major Hewlett executed.

22:42.125 --> 22:44.759
<i>I appreciate that you have
countless decisions to make,</i>

22:44.793 --> 22:47.830
<i>but with respect,
we have waited long enough."</i>

22:47.864 --> 22:49.998
( wind howling )

22:58.874 --> 23:02.146
Now, where were we?

23:04.349 --> 23:06.884
Aries?

23:06.918 --> 23:09.087
No, Perseus.

23:09.121 --> 23:11.757
Yes, do you see it?

23:11.792 --> 23:14.625
<i>The bright star there is called Algol.</i>

23:14.659 --> 23:18.728
It is Arabic for demon.

23:18.762 --> 23:21.297
That's quite fitting, really,

23:21.331 --> 23:24.301
because Perseus slew a demon.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.505
Medusa.

23:29.176 --> 23:31.776
Her gaze turned men to stone.

23:31.810 --> 23:34.681
But Perseus, he saved her.

23:36.354 --> 23:40.524
Just like I saved you from Simcoe.

23:43.728 --> 23:45.631
Anna.

23:48.136 --> 23:49.804
Andromeda.

23:49.838 --> 23:52.875
<i>You see, we are fated.</i>

23:58.652 --> 24:00.618
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

24:20.403 --> 24:23.934
Oh, no, not yet. Not by me.

24:23.968 --> 24:26.634
You see, I'm still waiting on the order.

24:29.770 --> 24:32.071
But you don't have to.

24:34.377 --> 24:38.012
I'm going to leave this here.

24:43.221 --> 24:45.585
You can try to end yourself.

24:48.055 --> 24:51.493
Or maybe you'll make things
interesting and run for the trees.

24:54.495 --> 24:57.666
You never know when you'll
find the door unlocked.

25:10.713 --> 25:12.748
<i>( Door closes )</i>

25:21.087 --> 25:23.588
No. ( muttering )

25:23.623 --> 25:25.622
No, no, no.

25:25.657 --> 25:27.423
No!

25:27.457 --> 25:30.193
( Whimpering )

25:34.798 --> 25:37.000
Maybe I did do it.

25:37.034 --> 25:38.935
Maybe I did do it.

25:40.438 --> 25:43.773
Was it me? Maybe I did do it.

25:43.808 --> 25:45.742
Maybe I did.

25:47.211 --> 25:49.211
Maybe I am a demon.

25:49.246 --> 25:51.816
A demon.

25:51.851 --> 25:54.485
De... demon.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.726
Simcoe.

26:05.363 --> 26:09.300
So decisions get made with or without you?

26:09.334 --> 26:12.136
Yes. If I want Hewlett's life spared,

26:12.170 --> 26:14.906
tonight's post is my final opportunity.

26:16.508 --> 26:19.175
- Your play.
- This is ridiculous.

26:19.209 --> 26:21.674
- Beg pardon?
- Gambling isn't medicine.

26:21.709 --> 26:23.311
This is vice.

26:23.345 --> 26:26.744
Lawrence would never waste time
playing games with a servant.

26:26.778 --> 26:29.747
He would serve justice and execute Hewlett.

26:30.949 --> 26:32.548
Just 'cause Lawrence protected you

26:32.582 --> 26:35.116
don't mean you gotta try and be him.

26:35.150 --> 26:37.385
Watch yourself.

26:37.419 --> 26:40.387
Whoo. What I tell you?

26:40.421 --> 26:43.223
That brother of yours must
have had a really bad hand.

26:46.661 --> 26:48.728
( Choking )

26:48.763 --> 26:51.431
Never speak

26:51.466 --> 26:54.167
of my brother again.

26:59.774 --> 27:02.443
( Coughing )

27:13.924 --> 27:17.059
( crying )

27:19.130 --> 27:22.300
And how was your dinner, darling?

27:22.334 --> 27:24.769
Exquisite. There was pork,

27:24.803 --> 27:28.205
venison, beef, and rabbit.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.942
And a lovely claret to wash it all down.

27:30.976 --> 27:32.441
How about yours, dear?

27:32.475 --> 27:34.175
Oh, we had all that

27:34.209 --> 27:36.609
plus a couple of quince pies for dessert.

27:36.643 --> 27:38.443
( Laughing )

27:38.477 --> 27:40.178
You know what I wish?

27:40.212 --> 27:41.913
That I wasn't toppin' your mother?

27:41.948 --> 27:44.348
( Laughing ) Toppin' your mother!

27:46.884 --> 27:48.752
<i>( Laughing )</i>

27:48.786 --> 27:52.921
Soldier: <i>The old warhorse just takes it</i>

27:52.955 --> 27:56.957
instead of hanging that redcoat what
murdered McCarrey in Connecticut.

27:56.991 --> 27:58.826
<i>( Men grunting )</i>

27:58.860 --> 28:01.629

28:06.870 --> 28:08.371
Soldier ♪2: <i>Yeah?</i>

28:08.405 --> 28:10.673
Well, my mother has the clap,

28:10.707 --> 28:13.011
so you two are perfect for each other.

28:13.046 --> 28:15.613
( Laughing )

28:21.888 --> 28:24.322
Soldier: <i>What's he afraid of?</i>

28:28.898 --> 28:30.834
I am not afraid.

29:09.965 --> 29:11.901
Anna.

29:11.935 --> 29:14.037
Fight, Abraham.

29:14.071 --> 29:16.004
Fight.

29:21.778 --> 29:23.344
Yates: <i>Woodhull!</i>

29:23.379 --> 29:25.979

29:26.013 --> 29:28.616
Yates: <i>Happy New Year,</i> <i>Mr. Woodhull.</i>

29:28.650 --> 29:31.116
You have a visitor.

29:31.150 --> 29:33.153
<i>( Door opens )</i>

29:33.187 --> 29:35.491
( Abe coughing )

29:39.929 --> 29:41.329
Go.

29:47.003 --> 29:49.506
( Coughing )

29:49.540 --> 29:51.508
How much did you pay Yates for this visit?

29:51.543 --> 29:52.742
That's not important.

29:52.776 --> 29:54.177
I wanted to see you

29:54.211 --> 29:56.582
and to bring you something that will help.

29:57.651 --> 29:59.817
You took your time.

30:01.187 --> 30:03.820
I was busy making sure your
wife and child were safe.

30:03.855 --> 30:07.355
You know Major Hewlett has
been abducted from Whitehall

30:07.390 --> 30:11.294
with Mary and Anna Strong
and myself held at gunpoint?

30:11.328 --> 30:13.227
( Coughs ) Anna?

30:13.261 --> 30:14.793
What was Anna doing there?

30:14.828 --> 30:17.762
It's for her protection
since Simcoe returned.

30:19.931 --> 30:21.731
- Simcoe?
- Yes.

30:21.765 --> 30:24.435
( Coughing )

30:30.338 --> 30:33.173
( coughing continues )

30:35.845 --> 30:37.845
- What's he done to her?
- Abraham...

30:37.879 --> 30:41.883
- Tell me what he's done to her!
- She's Simcoe's now!

30:41.917 --> 30:43.718
Half the town saw her kissing him

30:43.753 --> 30:46.985
in broad daylight on the tavern green.

30:47.019 --> 30:50.123
But you stand here accused of treason

30:50.157 --> 30:53.329
and all you can think to ask
me about is Anna Strong?

30:53.363 --> 30:56.862
After all this time, you
haven't learned a thing.

30:59.401 --> 31:03.567
I spent night after night
wondering why you would do this.

31:03.601 --> 31:06.366
Why would you write a letter
incriminating yourself?

31:06.400 --> 31:08.669
And there was my answer.

31:08.703 --> 31:10.171
You wanted to be caught.

31:10.205 --> 31:12.237
You know what you're doing is wrong.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.304
You really travelled all this
way just to lecture me?

31:14.338 --> 31:17.809
I'm not lect... ( groans, shouts )

31:17.843 --> 31:19.810
( exhales )

31:22.681 --> 31:24.683
But you know what?

31:24.717 --> 31:28.055
I have learned my lesson in regard to you.

31:28.090 --> 31:30.656
You will not listen to reason

31:30.691 --> 31:33.123
and you won't stop on your own.

31:34.961 --> 31:36.894
So perhaps this is the safest place for you,

31:36.928 --> 31:39.330
at least until this war is over.

31:40.533 --> 31:42.066
Hmm?

31:42.100 --> 31:44.400
Is that what you want?

31:44.434 --> 31:47.439
To stay here?

31:47.473 --> 31:48.874
To rot?

31:48.909 --> 31:51.176
Answer me!

31:51.211 --> 31:54.010
Ah, you...!

32:03.857 --> 32:06.289
You know, you're right about one thing.

32:07.889 --> 32:11.958
As long as I have air in my
lungs, I will never, ever stop.

32:34.013 --> 32:37.151
( Wind howling )

32:45.428 --> 32:47.465
Lawrence?

32:53.306 --> 32:56.377
What is all this?

32:56.412 --> 32:58.343
This war,

32:58.378 --> 33:00.443
was it a mistake?

33:00.477 --> 33:01.946
Was it greed?

33:01.980 --> 33:04.750
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

33:08.020 --> 33:10.389
Answer me, damn you!

33:14.429 --> 33:17.530
I have done everything you ever taught me.

33:19.198 --> 33:22.069
I tamed my temper,

33:22.103 --> 33:24.171
became a gentleman.

33:24.205 --> 33:25.506
I sought opportunity.

33:25.541 --> 33:29.743
I've climbed and clawed and fought

33:29.778 --> 33:33.580
and now I'm respected,

33:33.615 --> 33:38.351
feared, hated, and worshipped.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.951
But for what?

33:45.190 --> 33:48.222
I am not who they think I am.

33:53.529 --> 33:56.428
Oh, for the love of God, say something.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.437
Please.

34:03.471 --> 34:06.975
As always, you ask what I would do

34:07.009 --> 34:10.178
and I will tell you what I would not.

34:10.213 --> 34:13.920
I would never spare a murderer.

34:15.123 --> 34:16.922
Nor lose Long Island.

34:16.956 --> 34:19.592
Nor retreat at White Plains.

34:19.627 --> 34:23.433
Nor be outflanked at Brandywine.

34:28.571 --> 34:32.811
<i>Nor crossed the Delaware
on Christmas night...</i>

34:34.313 --> 34:36.849
<i>to claim a surprise victory.</i>

34:38.320 --> 34:41.154
<i>Nor led a campaign</i>

34:41.188 --> 34:45.257
against the mightiest empire on Earth.

34:55.703 --> 34:58.235
But then again...

35:01.375 --> 35:03.345
I am not you.

35:10.387 --> 35:13.325
( Wind howling )

35:40.299 --> 35:41.968
Man: <i>Post rider for the commander.</i>

35:42.002 --> 35:44.640
- Guard: <i>All right, go on in.</i>
- ( sniffles )

35:48.511 --> 35:49.946
The general ain't here.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.450
Don't know when he'll be back.

35:52.485 --> 35:54.618
Do you have his letter?

35:54.652 --> 35:56.655
No, sir.

35:56.689 --> 35:58.688
It's half midnight.

35:58.723 --> 36:00.389
The storm is churning up.

36:00.423 --> 36:03.358
If I wait much longer,
I might could get stuck.

36:04.325 --> 36:08.059
If you need to go, go.

36:13.134 --> 36:14.500
Wait.

36:17.205 --> 36:20.407
Best you hold post. Check back at midnight.

37:08.231 --> 37:10.601
I require fresh paper.

37:27.186 --> 37:29.857
Would you be needing anything else, General?

37:33.362 --> 37:35.030
No.

37:45.873 --> 37:48.075
Thank you...

37:49.211 --> 37:51.079
William.

38:14.548 --> 38:16.949
Washington's voice:
<i>"Dearest Lieutenant Chaffee,</i>

38:16.984 --> 38:21.752
<i>I wish to stay the execution
of Major Edmund Hewlett."</i>

38:21.787 --> 38:23.887
( wind whistling )

38:23.921 --> 38:26.290
<i>"He'll be traded back to
the British in exchange</i>

38:26.324 --> 38:29.127
<i>for several valuable
officers of the highest rank</i>

38:29.161 --> 38:31.864
<i>and importance to the army.</i>

38:39.108 --> 38:40.808
<i>I offer my deepest regret</i>

38:40.843 --> 38:42.742
<i>that I cannot provide justice</i>

38:42.776 --> 38:45.244
<i>for Captain McCarrey at this time.</i>

38:45.278 --> 38:47.716
<i>But allow me to assure you</i>

38:47.751 --> 38:49.517
<i>that sparing Major Hewlett</i>

38:49.551 --> 38:52.622
<i>will save the lives of our countrymen.</i>

38:58.230 --> 39:03.062
<i>It is of extreme importance
that he survive."</i>

39:03.097 --> 39:05.299
( whimpering )

39:09.462 --> 39:11.862
( screaming )

39:25.244 --> 39:28.512
<i>"This decision was mine,
but was not made alone.</i>

39:28.546 --> 39:31.380
<i>I have consulted with valued confidants,</i>

39:31.414 --> 39:35.486
<i>top men whom I trust with my own life.</i>

39:52.940 --> 39:56.378
<i>This has been a difficult winter for us all,</i>

39:56.413 --> 39:58.449
<i>but we'll survive it.</i>

39:58.484 --> 40:00.817
<i>We will prevail."</i>

40:00.852 --> 40:02.920
Pardon Hewlett?

40:03.857 --> 40:06.593
What... ( groans )

40:18.772 --> 40:20.906
I'll finish Hewlett.

40:20.940 --> 40:22.873
You lot take the rest.

40:35.253 --> 40:36.621
( Gunshot )

40:36.655 --> 40:39.524
- ( men shouting )
- ( gunshots )

40:41.727 --> 40:43.194
( shouts )

40:54.606 --> 40:57.007
<i>( gunshots, shouting continue )</i>

41:07.917 --> 41:10.151
Happy New Year, Major.

41:11.288 --> 41:15.327
Oh, dear, what have they done to you?

41:15.360 --> 41:18.059
It looks like a little oyster.

41:18.094 --> 41:21.160
- You killed their captain.
- I did?

41:21.194 --> 41:23.396
You cast the blame on me.

41:23.430 --> 41:25.264
To be fair, I thought these rebels

41:25.299 --> 41:27.365
would have put you out
of my misery right away.

41:27.400 --> 41:30.405
Seeing you like this, though,
is a welcome surprise.

41:31.375 --> 41:33.675
( Groans )

41:35.278 --> 41:37.616
( shouts )

41:44.994 --> 41:46.659
( both shout )

41:59.577 --> 42:02.847
( screaming )

42:11.757 --> 42:14.659
- Where is Hewlett?
- Save your strength.

42:14.693 --> 42:18.368
Mark his grave. We'll say he
was dead before we arrived.

42:20.105 --> 42:22.306
He ain't dead now.

42:22.340 --> 42:24.107
He will be.
