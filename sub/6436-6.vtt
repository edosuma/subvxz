WEBVTT

00:07.008 --> 00:11.798
(theme music plays )

00:11.971 --> 00:15.714
(thunder rumbling, rain pouring)

00:18.644 --> 00:21.932
Batiatus:
We have seen misfortune,

00:22.106 --> 00:24.848
felt the sting of defeat,

00:25.026 --> 00:28.189
the humility of vacant purse
and empty stomach.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.978
Some believed
the House of Batiatus

00:31.157 --> 00:33.364
would never reclaim
its former glory,

00:33.534 --> 00:35.525
that we would fade
from memory,

00:35.703 --> 00:38.194
forsaken by history.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.033
But we have
proved them wrong!

00:40.208 --> 00:41.948
Men: Yeah!

00:42.126 --> 00:43.866
We have proved
the name Batiatus

00:44.045 --> 00:46.502
will live long after we have gone
to dust and bone.

00:46.672 --> 00:48.003
Men: Yeah!

00:48.174 --> 00:51.587
So stand proud before
the bringer of rain,

00:51.761 --> 00:55.003
the slayer
of the shadow of death,

00:55.181 --> 00:57.843
the new champion of Capua:

00:58.017 --> 00:59.757
Spartacus!

00:59.936 --> 01:03.053
(all cheering )

01:13.324 --> 01:15.986
( men chanting )
Spartacus! Spartacus!

01:16.160 --> 01:17.991
Spartacus! Spartacus!

01:18.162 --> 01:20.744
Spartacus! Spartacus!

01:20.915 --> 01:22.906
Spartacus! Spartacus!

01:23.084 --> 01:25.700
Spartacus! Spartacus!

01:25.878 --> 01:27.493
Spartacus! Spartacus!

01:27.672 --> 01:30.038
Spartacus! Spartacus!

01:30.216 --> 01:32.457
Spartacus! Spartacus!

01:32.635 --> 01:35.752
Spartacus! Spartacus!

01:36.764 --> 01:39.551
(groaning)

01:42.270 --> 01:43.885
( crowd gasps )

01:49.944 --> 01:53.357
(thunder booming)

01:54.740 --> 01:57.482
(screaming )

01:57.660 --> 01:59.901
(all cheering )

02:00.079 --> 02:03.742
A titan-- his victory
eclipsing all others,

02:03.916 --> 02:06.999
quenching our thirst,

02:10.256 --> 02:12.668
Behold the man
as he becomes legend.

02:12.842 --> 02:14.958
Men: Yeah!

02:20.599 --> 02:21.975
This is only the beginning.

02:22.143 --> 02:25.635
I will build an empire of blood
and glory upon your name.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.930
He did not stand
against Theokoles on his own.

02:29.108 --> 02:30.644
Crixus is not forgotten.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.935
He will always have position...
if he survives.

02:34.113 --> 02:36.274
But Spartacus is the name
on the crowd's tongue

02:36.449 --> 02:39.316
and I would see it spoken
with ever-increasing amazement.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.326
l defeated a man
who could not be defeated.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.236
What more could
they expect of me?

02:44.415 --> 02:47.498
( laughs)
Everything!

02:47.668 --> 02:49.249
Their appetite is a great beast;

02:49.420 --> 02:51.661
it must constantly be fed
with new delights.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.875
We'll start by changing
your fighting style--

02:54.050 --> 02:56.837
two swords as Theokoles fought with.

02:57.011 --> 03:00.754
We'll see the crowd's pleasure double
with their new hero twice as deadly

03:00.931 --> 03:03.593
and new armor worthy of a legend.

03:05.603 --> 03:07.559
Women will moisten at the very sight.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.647
Ah, but I forget.

03:12.818 --> 03:15.195
He has no hard purpose
forjust any wet thigh, does he?

03:15.363 --> 03:18.480
He and his purpose
are not my concern.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.909
Batiatus:
Fortunately the gods feel otherwise.

03:21.077 --> 03:24.160
They shower him with more
than rain and accolades.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.912
They bless him with news
to lift the heart

03:27.083 --> 03:29.369
higher than the clouds.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.703
Sura?

03:30.878 --> 03:33.915
Found in the dark corners of Syria.

03:34.090 --> 03:35.330
Where-- where is she?
Is she well?

03:35.508 --> 03:36.998
Peace.

03:37.176 --> 03:39.337
All will be revealed
when a mouth closes.

03:39.512 --> 03:41.252
The Syrian Glaber spoke of
sold her to a merchant--

03:41.430 --> 03:42.465
the sea his mistress.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.676
They have recently docked
on the shores of Neapolis.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.057
- On Roman soil?
- Your wife among the slaves.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.719
Two days' ride from where you stand,
barring incident.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.309
- When do we leave?
- Is it wise to allow such a thing?

03:52.483 --> 03:54.724
My man already spurns his horse.
Rest at ease.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.984
She moves ever closer
even as we speak.

04:03.202 --> 04:05.614
You are an honorable man

04:05.788 --> 04:07.824
and will forever bear my gratitude.

04:07.998 --> 04:10.489
As you bear mine.

04:10.668 --> 04:14.035
Being reunited with your wife
is but the first of many rewards.

04:15.548 --> 04:17.379
Dominus.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.137
Secrets.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.970
Secrets upon secrets.

04:29.145 --> 04:31.978
News of her discovery
only just reached me.

04:32.148 --> 04:34.184
And what of good Ovidius
and his family?

04:35.443 --> 04:39.402
Why did you keep plans
towards their slaughter from me?

04:39.572 --> 04:41.483
And all to clear a few debts?

04:41.657 --> 04:44.444
It had nothing to do with debt,
except one of blood.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.200
His was the hand behind
attempt on my life in the pits.

04:47.371 --> 04:51.410
- Ovidius?
- Moved to purpose by Solonius.

04:54.587 --> 04:56.953
I keep from you not out of secrecy,
but from love.

04:57.131 --> 05:00.339
I would not have you stained
by such things.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.670
We are the toast of the fucking city!

05:02.845 --> 05:05.461
Let us pause and enjoy it.

05:22.448 --> 05:23.563
Doctore:
Yours alone.

05:23.741 --> 05:25.823
Not to be shared?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.779
Your achievement
in earning it profound.

05:27.953 --> 05:30.239
Made possible by your instruction.

05:30.414 --> 05:33.121
My actions only set you
to the task.

05:33.292 --> 05:35.374
By depriving Theokoles of his life,

05:35.544 --> 05:39.913
you put end to a battle
left unfinished by my sword,

05:40.090 --> 05:41.591
an end to my shame.

05:44.178 --> 05:48.717
| live to see my wife again
because of you...

05:48.891 --> 05:51.132
a debt not soon forgotten.

05:51.310 --> 05:54.222
There is no balance between us,

05:54.396 --> 05:56.887
only the promise of future glory.

06:01.195 --> 06:04.028
Are candles permitted?

06:04.198 --> 06:06.860
Sura was always fond of them.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.650
You misunderstand.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.989
This cell is for you alone.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.029
Wives are not permitted
to live among us.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.948
Then where will she stay?

06:16.126 --> 06:18.538
In the villa,
kept safe and well

06:18.712 --> 06:21.124
in return for good service
to the domina.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.756
- As a slave.
- As are we all.

06:26.136 --> 06:29.799
But you rise quickly,
unlike any other I've ever witnessed.

06:29.974 --> 06:32.932
Continue your ascent
and you will gain freedom

06:33.102 --> 06:35.058
for both of you.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.140
(thunder rumbling)

06:45.573 --> 06:47.313
Barca: Ashur.

06:49.410 --> 06:50.946
Barca!

06:51.120 --> 06:53.076
l was this very moment
coming to have word.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.738
Keep them.
lwould have coin instead.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.999
This is no small marvel--
the fall of Theokoles.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.455
Your wager in the favor
of the unexpected outcome,

07:01.630 --> 07:03.871
the size of the odds...

07:04.049 --> 07:06.381
It's not a simple matter
to cover a win of such margin, huh?

07:06.552 --> 07:08.258
(shouts, grunts)

07:08.429 --> 07:10.795
I give no shit for margins.

07:10.973 --> 07:13.806
Beg, steal or kill
to cover what is owed

07:13.976 --> 07:15.341
or you will have
two worthless legs

07:15.519 --> 07:17.680
and nothing in between
to prop yourself up.

07:17.855 --> 07:20.392
(gasping )

07:26.488 --> 07:28.479
( cooing )

07:30.951 --> 07:32.942
(tsking )

07:39.460 --> 07:41.200
I've had exchange with the cripple.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.754
He pays what is owed?

07:42.921 --> 07:46.084
Soon the coin will be in hand,
enough to buy our freedom.

07:52.014 --> 07:54.050
"Freedom..."

07:54.224 --> 07:56.215
the word is foreign to the tongue.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.224
It will learn to savor the taste.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.056
What of the birds?

08:00.230 --> 08:02.562
They'll fly this place, as we do.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.644
I'll see what clothes we have
packed and ready.

08:05.944 --> 08:08.856
Which direction shall we travel
and how far?

08:09.031 --> 08:12.068
As far as desire wills our feet.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.985
This cloak...

08:16.163 --> 08:18.495
it was the one you wore
when you left,

08:18.666 --> 08:19.906
when good Ovidius was murdered.

08:20.084 --> 08:21.290
There was nothing good about him.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.200
Then it was you who killed him?

08:23.379 --> 08:25.586
All his slaves, his family?

08:25.756 --> 08:27.667
My hands did what
they were commanded.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.378
What of the young boy--
Ovidius's son?

08:30.552 --> 08:31.758
Did they take his life too?

08:31.929 --> 08:34.841
Such were my orders,

08:35.015 --> 08:37.802
but you know of my affection
for delicate things.

08:39.478 --> 08:41.844
The boy was spared

08:42.022 --> 08:43.637
and set to wander far from the deed.

08:43.816 --> 08:46.182
By the time he is discovered,
we will be free.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.695
And your hands?

08:48.862 --> 08:53.026
Clean forevermore
and yours to command.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.984
Spartacus's victory ignites
the imagination of the city!

09:31.155 --> 09:33.396
Orders for my men flood in
from every family

09:33.574 --> 09:35.064
with half a name and a little coin.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.904
Prosperity beyond measure
is within our reach.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.319
As are those who would
have you dead.

09:41.457 --> 09:43.539
I will see Solonius pay
for the grievance.

09:43.709 --> 09:46.667
But these things are not be hurried.

09:46.837 --> 09:49.419
I would savor every drop
of sweat from his brow

09:49.590 --> 09:52.423
as my noose tightens
upon his neck.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.255
lwould prefer it tighten quickly.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.294
Uh, everything to its season.

09:57.473 --> 09:59.429
Turning towards
more pressing matters...

09:59.600 --> 10:02.637
Reuniting the Thracian with his wife?

10:02.811 --> 10:05.393
Not the matter I was referring to.

10:05.564 --> 10:10.775
Have the girl's ass a bit
and I'll watch.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.401
And lwould give pleasure
to your eyes.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.703
(grunting)

10:27.503 --> 10:29.915
The Thracian woman concerns me.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.838
The promise of finding her
was the only thing

10:34.009 --> 10:36.000
that kept him in check.

10:36.178 --> 10:39.090
What if her presence reverts him
to his Thracian ways

10:39.264 --> 10:42.006
and thoughts of defiance?

10:42.184 --> 10:43.924
It will not.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.593
How can you be so sure?

10:46.772 --> 10:49.639
Did you see the tears of gratitude
in his eyes?

10:50.901 --> 10:53.768
Gratitude falls short of loyalty.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.487
He's not the man Crixus is.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.194
And Crixus is not the man he was,

10:59.368 --> 11:03.111
and may never be again.

11:04.414 --> 11:08.623
Spartacus will be reunited
with his wife.

11:08.794 --> 11:12.412
And in the act,
lwill bind him to us

11:12.589 --> 11:14.500
and this ludus

11:14.675 --> 11:18.133
until God comes
to claim us all.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.685
(thunder rumbling)

11:44.371 --> 11:46.487
Varro:
How will you save us...

11:47.833 --> 11:49.448
from the rain?

11:49.626 --> 11:51.127
Your victory splits the skies.

11:51.295 --> 11:53.411
How will you close them
before we all drown?

11:53.589 --> 11:55.375
You believe
the rest of the fools, then?

11:55.549 --> 11:57.164
That I am blessed by the gods?

11:57.342 --> 11:59.674
Miracles do take habit
of shooting out of your ass.

11:59.845 --> 12:02.712
( chuckles )

12:02.890 --> 12:06.508
I've heard whispers of yet
more divine providence.

12:06.685 --> 12:09.848
Sura-- is it true?

12:10.022 --> 12:12.559
She speeds to my arms
from Neapolis.

12:12.733 --> 12:15.725
And still you doubt
the gods favor you.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.768
If what Sura has been
forced to endure

12:17.946 --> 12:20.688
is parcel of their favor, I would rather
they turn their back on me.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.652
- If they exist at all.
- She comes.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.566
That is all that matters now.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.736
Yeah.

12:27.998 --> 12:30.614
You once lived free in these lands.

12:30.792 --> 12:33.329
From which way does she travel?

12:33.503 --> 12:35.755
The port in Neapolis
lies in that direction.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.709
(thunder rumbling)

12:37.883 --> 12:39.623
Are there roads to the mountains
that lead east?

12:39.801 --> 12:41.302
Several.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.586
Which ones are
the most sparsely traveled?

12:43.764 --> 12:46.927
An odd question,
removed from the subject.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.682
Not so far astray.

12:51.521 --> 12:54.684
Yes, some are sparsely travelled,
but not to the point

12:54.858 --> 12:56.598
of the new champion
of fucking Capua

12:56.777 --> 12:59.314
going unnoticed if overcome
by questionable thoughts.

12:59.488 --> 13:03.401
How long do you think before Batiatus
would allow me to buy our freedom?

13:03.575 --> 13:06.032
How many years will she be
condemned to bow and scrape?

13:06.203 --> 13:07.443
Death the alternative?

13:07.621 --> 13:09.953
You move to escape beyond these walls,
and that is surely what you'll find.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.624
Has no one ever attempted
such a thing?

13:11.792 --> 13:13.532
And lived? No.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.871
It is a thing born of the impossible.

13:16.046 --> 13:18.708
The same was said
of defeating Theokoles.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.622
You have a plan, then?

13:20.801 --> 13:23.338
One begins to take shape.

13:23.512 --> 13:25.093
Ahh!

13:27.391 --> 13:29.677
( screams )

13:30.769 --> 13:33.101
( all shouting )

13:36.858 --> 13:39.691
( roaring )

13:53.542 --> 13:56.204
( roaring )

13:59.506 --> 14:01.462
Ooh!

14:08.223 --> 14:10.305
That's your plan?

14:10.475 --> 14:12.887
- I fear it malformed.
- In what way?

14:13.061 --> 14:14.642
Weapons, to begin.

14:14.813 --> 14:18.351
- In large supply at a ludus.
- Ah, but kept by lock and key.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.311
Or do you believe the gods
will drop one from the sky

14:20.485 --> 14:22.191
along with the rain?

14:22.362 --> 14:24.478
I believe in opportunity.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.692
And the power of reason
to seize upon it.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.073
Fair enough.

14:28.243 --> 14:30.825
Say you somehow reason up a weapon. What
of a horse?

14:30.996 --> 14:33.157
You'll never reach
the mountains without one.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.583
Dominus provides one.

14:35.751 --> 14:37.833
Sura arrives by cart.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.745
(neighing)

14:50.348 --> 14:51.724
Well, it won't matter.

14:51.892 --> 14:55.009
Weapons, horses--
they're the least of your concerns.

14:55.187 --> 14:56.677
And the greatest?

14:56.855 --> 14:59.187
The one man that could stop you.

15:01.526 --> 15:05.360
Ahh!

15:11.787 --> 15:13.743
(Sura cries out)

15:13.914 --> 15:16.701
Uh!

15:35.227 --> 15:36.433
Yah!

15:41.942 --> 15:42.977
I had not considered him.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.891
You have not considered many things.

15:45.070 --> 15:47.061
Take pause, I beg of you.

15:47.239 --> 15:51.198
No. We will have our freedom.

15:51.368 --> 15:54.485
I will take her in my arms
and hear her speak my name--

15:54.663 --> 15:56.324
my name,

15:56.498 --> 15:58.705
not the one the Romans
branded me with.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.957
- I cannot help you in this.
- I would not ask it.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.039
- If it weren't for my own family...
- Give it no thought.

16:03.213 --> 16:05.625
Is there nothing I can say
to turn you from this path?

16:05.799 --> 16:07.505
Nothing.

16:09.219 --> 16:11.801
Then may the gods
you don't believe in favor you.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.851
(thunderclaps )

16:54.181 --> 16:55.967
Batiatus:
A fine figure, is he not?

16:56.141 --> 16:57.847
A god among men.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.760
I've never beheld
such magnificent armor.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.018
If you grant permission,

17:06.193 --> 17:08.149
I would wear it
upon my wife's return.

17:08.320 --> 17:09.856
A move to impress?

17:11.907 --> 17:14.865
- She will marvel at the sight.
- ( thunderclap )

17:26.087 --> 17:29.921
( roaring )

17:36.264 --> 17:39.427
( roaring )

17:41.686 --> 17:44.223
A man must always appear
his best in the eyes of love.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.432
You may wear it.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.598
I will even stand by your side
while you welcome her

17:47.776 --> 17:49.232
with your open arms.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.687
The swords, however...

17:50.862 --> 17:52.568
What need would I have of them?

17:56.826 --> 17:58.782
Calavius:
Can it be?

17:58.954 --> 18:00.865
The legend himself among us?

18:01.039 --> 18:03.701
Magistrate Calavius.
Good fortune to see you.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.581
No, the good fortune is mine.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.289
My son Numerius cannot cease
his talk of Spartacus

18:08.463 --> 18:10.169
and his victory over Theokoles.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.459
He demanded
a trip to market

18:12.634 --> 18:16.172
to obtain something of Thrace
in your man's honor.

18:16.346 --> 18:17.836
Show him.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.715
The merchant said
it was a warrior's weapon.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.644
As well it is.

18:30.735 --> 18:33.522
See these marks?

18:33.697 --> 18:37.315
Thracians notch their hilts--
one for every kill.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.568
Numerius: How many made to yours
after slaying Theokoles?

18:41.746 --> 18:44.203
He must have been
worth 10 at least.

18:44.374 --> 18:45.363
Spartacus: Hmm.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.954
If I could wield a sword
half as well you...

18:50.463 --> 18:53.955
Join us at my master's ludus

18:54.134 --> 18:57.718
and I will teach you the blow
that brought death to the shadow.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.754
Batiatus:
A splendid notion.

19:00.932 --> 19:03.048
Numerius: Father?

19:03.226 --> 19:05.433
Perhaps a visit later
this afternoon.

19:05.603 --> 19:07.594
Batiatus: Why make the boy
suffer with anticipation?

19:07.772 --> 19:08.978
Join us presently.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.640
Joy must be delayed
in favor of sorrow.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.605
I attend to matters relating
to my cousin's murder.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.229
Batiatus:
Good Ovidius.

19:17.407 --> 19:19.398
The heart constricts at the thought.

19:19.576 --> 19:22.113
But swells with promise of vengeance.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.039
Numerius, come.

19:25.206 --> 19:28.118
Your generous hospitality
will be appreciated shortly.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.785
(grunts)

19:35.592 --> 19:38.550
An invitation to school
the magistrate's son?

19:38.720 --> 19:42.133
Apologies if I offered out of turn.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.093
Fuck apologies.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.474
Shrewd maneuvering,
if ever I saw it!

19:46.644 --> 19:48.145
I'll make a Roman of you yet!

19:48.313 --> 19:50.554
(laughing)

19:58.823 --> 20:01.405
Should his eyes not be open?

20:01.576 --> 20:03.567
Calm is needed to heal the wound.

20:03.745 --> 20:05.701
I keep him at rest with herb.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.659
- He will recover?
- I've done what I can.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.949
lt rests in the hands of the gods.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.243
No.

20:13.421 --> 20:16.458
His life now rests in your hands.

20:16.633 --> 20:20.217
And lwill see them parted
from your fucking body if he dies.

20:24.474 --> 20:27.341
See how they all look at you?

20:27.519 --> 20:29.259
My father had many champions,

20:29.437 --> 20:31.814
but none to rival
the great Spartacus.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.812
(laughing)

20:33.983 --> 20:38.693
You can almost smell the coins
dropping into our purse.

20:38.863 --> 20:42.822
If I may, what remains of my own coin
after Sura's transport?

20:42.992 --> 20:44.983
You wish to buy something
for your wife?

20:45.161 --> 20:48.494
This market is for proper Romans.
It would not suit a slave.

20:48.665 --> 20:51.998
| ask not for me,
but for the men.

20:52.168 --> 20:55.035
Wine and women
in celebration of my victory.

20:55.213 --> 20:58.876
A noble gesture
to be much appreciated.

20:59.050 --> 21:02.884
You pay with your own coin,
yet their happiness is a benefit to me.

21:03.054 --> 21:06.296
( chuckles )
Very well. Let it be done.

21:06.474 --> 21:09.056
Uh, Marcellus is of sound choice
towards the vice.

21:09.227 --> 21:11.183
Should I make arrangement?

21:14.357 --> 21:17.099
- See that there's ample remainder.
- Dominus.

21:18.361 --> 21:21.819
Come, let us prepare
for the magistrate's arrival.

21:35.462 --> 21:39.000
- More threats then, is it?
- No.

21:40.091 --> 21:42.002
Coin to the purpose
of wine and whores,

21:42.177 --> 21:44.839
enough to wet tongue and cock
for my master's men.

21:47.891 --> 21:51.258
And a large matter of debt
to the gladiator Barca

21:51.436 --> 21:53.973
that I would ask assistance with.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.691
Ah!

22:00.862 --> 22:02.944
l have no hand for this.

22:06.326 --> 22:09.534
Your belt and adornments--
they hinder your purpose.

22:09.704 --> 22:11.319
Your armor is heavy,
yet you move swiftly.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.864
Spartacus:
In time so will you.

22:14.042 --> 22:18.285
A true warrior needs
only a sword to cleave his fate.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.718
Numerius:
| see your meaning.

22:27.889 --> 22:29.595
Let us go again.

22:29.766 --> 22:32.223
Play Theokoles and I will attempt
to bring the rains.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.139
Okay.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.226
Calavius:
Apologies for our late arrival.

22:43.404 --> 22:47.192
My inquiry at my cousin's villa
was overwhelming.

22:48.243 --> 22:49.608
How did you fare?

22:49.786 --> 22:52.823
As expected when walking
on dead relatives.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.201
Your son is a quick study
with the sword.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.662
Born of a fascination with gladiators.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.166
Calavius:
His 15th birthday approaches

23:02.340 --> 23:04.331
and my ears are assaulted
with request for a pair

23:04.509 --> 23:07.342
to show demonstration
at his party.

23:07.512 --> 23:10.629
I had thought
to engage Solonius's men,

23:10.807 --> 23:14.391
but his wares have fallen out of fashion
since your victory over Theokoles.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.927
Your son has a taste
for what is in favor.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.345
And I would see him well fed.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.764
Come, let us negotiate
a price for the meal.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.102
Begging pardon, Dominus.

23:22.277 --> 23:24.984
I bring word of great import
to Magistrate Calavius.

23:25.154 --> 23:28.738
An important man,
seldom out of reach of public matters.

23:32.328 --> 23:34.705
No, this message strikes
more personal.

23:34.872 --> 23:37.830
Ovidius's boy yet lives!

23:39.419 --> 23:41.410
Well, this is fantastic.
How can it be?

23:41.588 --> 23:43.078
With Jupiter's blessing.

23:43.256 --> 23:46.248
He was discovered miles north of Capua,
wandering the road.

23:46.426 --> 23:47.882
What of his words?

23:48.052 --> 23:50.134
Does he describe the horrors--
how he came to survive?

23:50.305 --> 23:53.638
Details not yet clear.
Numerius, come!

23:55.727 --> 23:57.638
Do not forget your things.

24:00.982 --> 24:03.268
Gratitude for the lesson.
It was an honor.

24:03.443 --> 24:05.604
Calavius: Numerius!

24:16.456 --> 24:18.697
(yelling)

24:19.792 --> 24:22.659
- How can the boy still be alive?
- He could not.

24:22.837 --> 24:25.874
- Lucretia: Your eyes beheld his death?
- No.

24:26.049 --> 24:27.880
I left the deed in Barca's hands.

24:28.051 --> 24:31.964
Lucretia:
And our lives as well.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.220
- What are we going to do?
- Fuck. I'm thinking!

24:34.390 --> 24:35.971
Ashur:
Pardon the intrusion.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.303
Provision for the celebration arrive.

24:38.478 --> 24:39.763
Batiatus:
Cunt with celebration.

24:39.937 --> 24:43.304
We are betrayed by the beast
of fucking Carthage

24:43.483 --> 24:45.565
and you bray about
wine and whores.

24:45.735 --> 24:48.021
- Barca?
- Yeah.

24:48.196 --> 24:49.857
The man has always been loyal.

24:50.031 --> 24:53.569
As a snake to the breast.
The son of Ovidius lives.

24:54.869 --> 24:57.656
Unfortunate news.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.616
Would the boy know your face?

24:59.791 --> 25:01.998
No, l was in shadow.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.079
But Barca was clearly revealed.

25:05.296 --> 25:07.753
I cannot believe Barca
would betray you.

25:10.802 --> 25:12.042
And yet...

25:14.097 --> 25:17.055
If you have knowledge,
bring it to light.

25:18.518 --> 25:22.010
Barca placed a wager against Theokoles,
winning sizable coin.

25:22.188 --> 25:26.898
I overheard him whisper to Pietros
intentions to buy their freedom with it.

25:27.068 --> 25:30.606
Barca has never mentioned
desire to leave these walls.

25:30.780 --> 25:33.146
He seeks to fly before discovery.

25:33.324 --> 25:35.861
If the child is allowed
to look upon his face,

25:36.035 --> 25:37.696
he will be known as your man.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.406
Gather proper guard
and return with Barca.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.241
I would hear truth
spilled from his mouth.

25:41.416 --> 25:45.125
When a man is pressed,
lies flow with greater ease.

25:45.294 --> 25:46.875
End him and be done with it.

25:47.046 --> 25:51.540
Not before I look into his eyes
and see if treachery lurks there.

25:51.718 --> 25:55.006
Perhaps there is another path
to illumination,

25:56.139 --> 26:00.098
one traveled
by more delicate sensibility.

26:03.354 --> 26:05.390
- ( laughing )
- Man: Give it to the whores!

26:05.565 --> 26:07.851
Man #2:
More wine!

26:08.025 --> 26:10.687
Woman:
Try this one.

26:18.578 --> 26:21.035
- Woman: This is so exhausting!
- Man: Where's the wine?

26:24.041 --> 26:26.032
Woman:
Have you had enough wine?

26:26.210 --> 26:27.370
Man #3:
Hold on, you sexy...

26:27.545 --> 26:30.662
Tomorrow the men
will be slow from drink.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.831
And half the guards with them.

26:37.597 --> 26:41.886
There is one that does not partake
in yourjoyous offerings,

26:42.059 --> 26:46.553
a man of higher principle,
not so easily distracted.

26:48.524 --> 26:50.105
How does Crixus fare?

26:50.276 --> 26:52.392
Adrift in the land of dreams--

26:52.570 --> 26:56.404
kept there yet by the medicus
in hope of recovery.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.025
I would pay my respects.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.459
You drown me!

27:10.630 --> 27:13.167
In more than just wine.

27:16.010 --> 27:19.423
Pietros, you are summoned.

27:32.610 --> 27:35.443
( raspy breathing )

27:35.613 --> 27:37.979
What are you doing?

27:38.157 --> 27:42.491
I come to share drink
with my partner in victory.

27:42.662 --> 27:46.496
Well, pay your respects and be gone.
He needs rest.

27:46.666 --> 27:49.453
And keep that fucking wine
from his lips.

27:59.220 --> 28:01.427
Without you, brother,

28:01.597 --> 28:05.510
my blood would have fallen
in the arena instead of the rain.

28:05.685 --> 28:10.679
May the gods forever honor Crixus,
the undefeated Gaul.

28:17.405 --> 28:19.987
And forgive the pain | cause.

28:25.621 --> 28:29.739
- ( coughing )
- Move aside!

28:29.917 --> 28:33.159
His wound has reopened.
The brown jar, quickly!

28:34.422 --> 28:36.413
- Will this heal him?
- No.

28:36.591 --> 28:40.459
But it will calm him to sleep
so that I may seal the wound.

28:45.641 --> 28:49.008
- Will he be all right?
- Get the fuck out!

29:02.366 --> 29:04.823
- I've had too much wine already.
- None of worth.

29:04.994 --> 29:08.282
This is Falernian, none of that swill
flowing below us.

29:10.750 --> 29:14.334
Mm, it truly tastes of the gods.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.664
And brings us closer to them.

29:18.049 --> 29:19.380
How fares Barca?

29:19.550 --> 29:21.586
ln fine spirits, as are all the men.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.503
Hmm. Is your confidence
to be trusted?

29:24.680 --> 29:27.547
Yes, of course, Dominus.

29:27.725 --> 29:30.011
Several days ago,
l was forced to take retribution

29:30.186 --> 29:31.801
against Ovidius,
the grain merchant.

29:31.979 --> 29:33.935
He had made attempt
on my life in the pits.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.642
The man was a danger
and not to be trusted.

29:35.816 --> 29:38.603
He had to be handled accordingly.
You understand?

29:38.778 --> 29:41.611
Now rumor abounds that
more than Ovidius gave up their lives--

29:41.781 --> 29:43.066
his entire family slain.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.617
There was even a child.

29:45.785 --> 29:48.447
The rest I can put from mind,
but the boy--

29:48.621 --> 29:50.452
he troubles my conscience.

29:50.623 --> 29:52.909
lf Barca exceeded my orders
and laid hand to such an act--

29:53.084 --> 29:56.247
No, he didn't kill the boy.

29:56.420 --> 29:58.536
Perhaps you only tell me
what I wish to hear.

29:58.714 --> 30:00.500
No no no.
He told me so himself.

30:00.675 --> 30:02.461
He swore he'd never harm a child.

30:05.096 --> 30:07.553
Well, this gives reason
to put conscience to rest.

30:08.724 --> 30:10.305
He'll be so pleased to know it.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.592
We'll keep it from him yet a while.

30:12.770 --> 30:15.637
I do not wish to taint the celebration
with such dark thoughts.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.646
Yes, Dominus.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.479
Thank you for your honesty, Pietros.

30:30.079 --> 30:34.118
The true nature of the man
is revealed.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.748
I would not have thought it of him.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.453
Let Barca hoist his cup the while.

30:40.631 --> 30:42.132
When his wits are damp with wine,

30:42.299 --> 30:45.962
then lwill see him rewarded
for his loyalty.

30:46.137 --> 30:47.843
Dominus.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.047
( chatter, shouting )

31:21.088 --> 31:22.874
You smell of wine.

31:23.049 --> 31:27.258
I bring cups full of celebration.

31:27.428 --> 31:31.296
l honor your victory with prayer.

31:33.642 --> 31:37.134
Your instruction made possible
reunion with my wife.

31:37.313 --> 31:39.554
I would raise cups in gratitude.

31:39.732 --> 31:42.474
The sentiment is well received,

31:42.651 --> 31:46.235
but wine has not passed my lips
for many years.

31:46.405 --> 31:50.489
- Your gods forbid it?
- No.

31:53.537 --> 31:55.573
It is a matter of discipline.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.578
Sura always cautioned
toward the same.

32:00.753 --> 32:02.289
A wise woman.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.336
Far beyond the station
of her husband.

32:06.967 --> 32:10.551
- If she had not come into my life...
- And now she returns.

32:10.721 --> 32:13.337
The gods have truly blessed you.

32:13.516 --> 32:15.973
Sura would say the same.

32:16.143 --> 32:18.225
And you?

32:18.395 --> 32:20.772
The gods and I do not tread
common ground.

32:20.940 --> 32:26.060
Although she made effort many times
to place us at equal footing.

32:26.237 --> 32:28.319
Wise and understanding

32:28.489 --> 32:30.480
to love a man
despite his shortcomings.

32:30.658 --> 32:33.491
She is the only reason
my heart beats within my chest.

32:33.661 --> 32:37.449
To find a love such as this

32:37.623 --> 32:39.534
is a rare and fortunate thing.

32:41.502 --> 32:43.367
You speak from knowledge?

32:44.880 --> 32:47.747
A wife of my own,

32:47.925 --> 32:50.257
the thought of her
ever upon my mind.

32:53.222 --> 32:54.632
Does she live?

32:58.519 --> 33:00.510
In memory.

33:02.982 --> 33:06.224
I would have desired to meet her

33:06.402 --> 33:08.734
and tell her of her husband's worth.

33:13.159 --> 33:16.367
Apologies for disturbing your prayers.

33:16.537 --> 33:18.323
Spartacus.

33:24.628 --> 33:26.960
I cannot drink to victory.

33:28.799 --> 33:33.133
But to your wife
and herjoyous return...

33:36.140 --> 33:38.847
discipline gives way to the moment.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.471
You honor us.

33:41.645 --> 33:43.476
( chuckles )

33:50.529 --> 33:54.317
( chatter, yelling )

34:08.422 --> 34:11.380
( men chanting )

34:11.550 --> 34:13.506
(dice rattling )

34:13.677 --> 34:15.087
Aw!

34:20.434 --> 34:23.471
- Come on, throw.
- Hey, yeah. Come on, throw.

34:23.646 --> 34:25.307
Ah, fuck that!

34:30.653 --> 34:34.396
Yeah!
( laughing )

34:37.159 --> 34:38.820
Whoa, what did the dominus require?

34:38.994 --> 34:40.609
Nothing of import.

34:42.706 --> 34:45.243
You kiss with purpose.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.999
For the thought of freedom.

34:53.259 --> 34:56.126
( clears throat )

34:56.303 --> 34:57.918
A word, if I may.

34:58.097 --> 35:00.964
Fuck your words,
unless coupled with coin.

35:01.141 --> 35:03.427
The very matter I came to discuss.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.513
l've secured a sizable loan
from good Marcellus

35:05.688 --> 35:06.677
to cover your winnings.

35:06.855 --> 35:08.436
The terms of interest
were outrageous!

35:08.607 --> 35:10.563
Give it here.

35:10.734 --> 35:13.726
Marcellus will bring it when he collects
his whore in the morning.

35:16.448 --> 35:18.530
You interrupt my cock
with empty hands?

35:18.701 --> 35:20.066
And intelligence.

35:20.244 --> 35:22.075
Batiatus knows
of your desire for freedom

35:22.246 --> 35:24.703
and makes noise
for discussing terms.

35:24.873 --> 35:28.115
Your skills,
while impressive in the arena,

35:28.294 --> 35:32.128
lack a certain gentle touch
in the art of negotiation.

35:32.298 --> 35:34.960
I can offer to bargain a better price
from Batiatus for your release,

35:35.134 --> 35:38.797
half the difference to be subtracted
from my debt to you.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.591
Batiatus is in agreeable spirits.

35:41.765 --> 35:43.630
If we move with haste...

35:43.809 --> 35:46.425
Go.

35:46.603 --> 35:51.939
Let's go and call him Dominus
for the final time.

35:54.737 --> 35:56.944
Hah!
(laughing)

35:59.158 --> 36:01.023
Whoo!

36:14.173 --> 36:17.461
I hear whispers you seek freedom.

36:19.136 --> 36:21.343
Ashur represents me
in the discussion.

36:22.765 --> 36:24.881
Discussion?

36:25.059 --> 36:26.799
There's none to be had
in the matter.

36:26.977 --> 36:29.764
The bond between master and slave
has already been dissolved...

36:34.401 --> 36:36.813
the moment you disobeyed me.

36:36.987 --> 36:39.194
Disobeyed?

36:40.783 --> 36:43.115
The son of Ovidius lives.

36:49.124 --> 36:50.625
Impossible.

36:50.793 --> 36:53.830
The magistrate rides
to retrieve him yet breathing,

36:54.004 --> 36:58.168
small fingers trembling to reveal
the beast that took away his family.

36:58.342 --> 36:59.832
This cannot be.

37:00.010 --> 37:03.844
My hands upon his throat--
I felt the life flee from his body.

37:06.934 --> 37:08.970
Your lover spoke otherwise.

37:10.896 --> 37:12.397
Pietros?

37:13.649 --> 37:16.607
You told him the boy lives,
did you not?

37:16.777 --> 37:20.690
I did, but only to calm him.

37:20.864 --> 37:23.697
If he knew the child's blood
stained my hands...

37:23.867 --> 37:25.732
So you lied to him?

37:28.539 --> 37:31.246
Or he lies to you now.

37:32.876 --> 37:36.835
Either way,
we've a serious issue of trust.

37:39.383 --> 37:42.375
Dominus, let me-- ahh!

37:45.389 --> 37:47.129
Ahh!

37:49.309 --> 37:51.140
Well, stop him!

38:02.322 --> 38:04.062
Rah!

38:08.120 --> 38:10.076
Ahh!

38:14.251 --> 38:16.333
(grunts)

38:20.174 --> 38:21.505
( clay shatters )

38:22.759 --> 38:24.750
Ahh!

38:37.024 --> 38:38.935
( gasps )

38:43.655 --> 38:47.193
(screaming )

39:02.216 --> 39:05.333
(thunder rumbling)

39:14.603 --> 39:17.436
( choking )

39:20.234 --> 39:22.145
Now you're free.

39:54.476 --> 39:58.970
(men singing)

40:41.106 --> 40:43.813
Barca purchased his freedom.

40:43.984 --> 40:47.272
We wished him well and escorted him
through the gates of the villa.

40:47.446 --> 40:49.858
Do you understand?

40:50.032 --> 40:51.192
Yes, Domina.

40:51.366 --> 40:54.608
- Do you understand?
- Yes!

40:54.786 --> 40:57.368
-( knocking )
- Man: Open up!

40:58.790 --> 41:01.782
Juno's cunt!
What now?

41:01.960 --> 41:03.996
Man:
Make way for the magistrate.

41:04.171 --> 41:06.002
- Fuck!
- Close the curtains.

41:06.173 --> 41:08.209
Santos, clean the blood up in there.
Get it cleaned up!

41:08.383 --> 41:11.090
Give way! Batiatus.

41:11.261 --> 41:12.876
Magistrate.

41:13.055 --> 41:15.046
You call at unexpected hour.

41:15.223 --> 41:18.260
Drawn by matters
that will not wait for dawn.

41:18.435 --> 41:22.019
- What new offense is this?
- Uh, nothing.

41:22.189 --> 41:24.396
A disobedient slave
freshly corrected.

41:24.566 --> 41:27.603
Not the only wretch
deserving of blood this night.

41:27.778 --> 41:30.520
l have just now returned
from the promised reunion

41:30.697 --> 41:32.198
with Ovidius's son

41:32.366 --> 41:35.699
and would have words
with a man seen in your house.

41:35.869 --> 41:37.370
Which man do you speak of?

41:37.537 --> 41:40.529
The messenger that filled
my heart with false hope.

41:41.917 --> 41:43.157
Messenger?

41:43.335 --> 41:45.997
Ovidius's child was not seen
on any road.

41:46.171 --> 41:49.504
Returning to the city, we had news
that his body was discovered

41:49.675 --> 41:52.587
among the ashes
of my cousin's villa.

41:52.761 --> 41:54.922
The messenger lied.

41:55.097 --> 41:58.009
I will have knowledge of the reason,
along with the fool's tongue.

41:58.183 --> 42:02.347
Every effort will be exhausted
until the villain is discovered.

42:07.025 --> 42:10.017
Coin paired with gratitude.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.060
The messenger had
the desired effect, then?

42:12.239 --> 42:13.820
My concerns
have been laid to rest,

42:13.990 --> 42:17.653
sharing grave with Barca
and his thirst for winnings.

42:21.331 --> 42:23.367
There's no chance
the magistrate will deduce

42:23.542 --> 42:24.952
the source of this message?

42:25.127 --> 42:27.334
Not unless Hades speaks of it
from the underworld.

42:27.504 --> 42:28.584
Mm.

42:28.755 --> 42:30.666
The messenger
has been put to grass.

42:30.841 --> 42:34.004
And you will follow
if a word of this transaction

42:34.177 --> 42:36.839
parts your lips again.

42:38.724 --> 42:40.635
Mm.

42:46.273 --> 42:48.559
l shit myself.

42:50.485 --> 42:52.976
Ashur. Ashur.

42:53.155 --> 42:55.612
Young Pietros!
How does the day find you?

42:55.782 --> 42:58.319
As the night-- filled with worry.
Barca never returned.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.279
Nor will he.
He has his freedom.

43:00.454 --> 43:01.910
- Freedom?
- Yes.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.695
Purchased from our dominus.

43:03.874 --> 43:06.991
I could barely keep pace
as we saw him to the gates.

43:08.003 --> 43:09.994
He was to take me with him.

43:10.172 --> 43:12.959
The price of freedom was too steep
for the both of you.

43:13.133 --> 43:15.374
But do not worry.

43:15.552 --> 43:18.589
I'm sure Barca will find
another tight hole to sit on his cock--

43:18.764 --> 43:21.096
one he doesn't have to pay for.

43:42.704 --> 43:45.446
Jupiter's cock, my head.

43:45.624 --> 43:47.706
I can barely stand for want of vomit.

43:47.876 --> 43:50.117
You're in large company.

43:52.631 --> 43:55.122
No one in condition
to halt a man of purpose.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.382
Such by design.

43:57.552 --> 44:00.510
Doctore's usually up before the sun,
whip in hand.

44:01.515 --> 44:03.130
Will he ever rise again?

44:03.308 --> 44:05.845
He will, but not for many hours.

44:06.019 --> 44:08.977
Oh, your chances improve then.

44:09.147 --> 44:13.060
- To the point of certainty.
- Nothing is ever so.

44:13.235 --> 44:16.022
Look, even if you ride beyond the gates,
the guards will pursue.

44:16.196 --> 44:18.061
They will be commanded
against such action.

44:19.950 --> 44:21.531
You actually expect them
to obey you?

44:21.701 --> 44:22.781
No.

44:22.953 --> 44:25.615
I expect them to obey their master.

44:29.584 --> 44:33.827
Drop your fucking swords!
Do it!

44:34.005 --> 44:38.044
I will release him when we are
in the cover of the mountains.

44:38.218 --> 44:39.924
Batiatus: Spartacus!

44:40.095 --> 44:42.427
Your wife's cart
appears on the road.

44:42.597 --> 44:45.009
I'll be with you presently.

44:45.183 --> 44:48.050
I urge you to reconsider
one last time.

44:48.228 --> 44:50.514
Sura will be free

44:50.689 --> 44:54.352
in this life, or the one after,

44:54.526 --> 44:56.642
with her husband by her side.

45:00.824 --> 45:04.362
Then may the gods see you both
upon the plains of Thrace.

45:13.837 --> 45:15.828
(thunderclaps )

45:26.850 --> 45:28.806
Lucretia:
The pool is clear,

45:28.977 --> 45:30.968
as if it never happened.

45:31.146 --> 45:33.307
A regrettable misunderstanding.

45:36.693 --> 45:38.979
He wished for his freedom.

45:39.154 --> 45:41.691
A betrayal in itself.

45:44.242 --> 45:45.698
Come, to happier thoughts.

45:45.869 --> 45:47.825
The Thracian's wife approaches.

45:47.996 --> 45:50.237
How is that a cause for cheer?

45:50.415 --> 45:51.996
Her arrival will only remind him

45:52.167 --> 45:53.657
of his old life
and the ways of an animal.

45:53.835 --> 45:55.416
Why can't you see that?

45:55.587 --> 45:57.794
Our hopes and fortunes
are tied to Spartacus.

45:57.964 --> 45:59.829
I made a promise
to reunite him with his wife.

46:00.008 --> 46:03.091
In honor of the man,
I will keep my word.

46:46.471 --> 46:48.086
( horse neighs)

47:00.443 --> 47:03.606
Man:
Opening the gates!

47:04.739 --> 47:08.072
A carriage approaches...

47:31.641 --> 47:34.178
Whoa.

47:34.352 --> 47:36.843
Whoa.

48:08.553 --> 48:10.885
( yawns )

48:25.945 --> 48:28.687
( neighs )

49:02.690 --> 49:04.601
(grunts)

49:12.033 --> 49:15.070
( groans )

49:15.245 --> 49:18.282
Driver: They came
out of nowhere, on the road.

49:18.456 --> 49:22.495
( echoing ) They attacked--
they attacked on the road.

51:08.066 --> 51:10.057
I'm here.

51:43.268 --> 51:46.510
My word is kept.

51:46.688 --> 51:48.895
They're reunited.
