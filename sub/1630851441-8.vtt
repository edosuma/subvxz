WEBVTT

00:08.258 --> 00:09.259
Previously
on "The Lost Symbol"...

00:09.300 --> 00:10.719
Your father's brotherhood

00:10.760 --> 00:13.513
has something
that does not belong to them.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.765
-Today we both escape.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.267
People have been killed!

00:17.308 --> 00:18.643
You're no longer part
of this operation.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.103
You're going
to take an early retirement.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.230
We must ensure
the mystery remains

00:22.272 --> 00:23.606
unsolved.

00:24.607 --> 00:25.650
Zachary.

00:27.068 --> 00:29.863
How did my boy become that

00:29.904 --> 00:32.240
monster?

00:47.839 --> 00:50.383
KNOPP
We want the artifacts.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.385
He had a phone on him.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.179
We're trying
to crack the passcode,

00:54.220 --> 00:57.766
trace his recent movements
in hopes of locating the pieces.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.206
NUÑEZ
Do you know what happened?

01:21.247 --> 01:22.624
What's she saying?

01:22.665 --> 01:24.376
She's not saying anything.
She can't talk.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.294
They didn't tell you?

01:26.336 --> 01:28.296
-Tell me what?
-She got cut.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.840
Doc says, a hair deeper,
would've hit the jugular.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.562
Hey.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.565
Hey.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.867
What happened?

01:57.909 --> 01:59.953
Who did this?

02:07.627 --> 02:09.671
No.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.676
It's...

02:14.718 --> 02:16.678
not...

02:16.720 --> 02:18.722
over.

03:05.101 --> 03:07.395
Is he still asleep?

03:07.437 --> 03:09.397
Reading.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.359
"The Ramayana,"
original Sanskrit.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.736
It's a good sign.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.542
Cymatics.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.586
It's the science
of visible sound.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.255
Vibrational phenomena.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.049
Right.

03:36.091 --> 03:39.427
Galileo and da Vinci
experimented with vibrations

03:39.469 --> 03:42.597
to produce patterns, figures.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.892
-That's what this is?
-Yeah.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.894
He was studying it.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.105
I don't know why.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.648
It doesn't even make sense.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.484
This is the kid--
he cheated on his finals,

03:54.526 --> 03:56.361
he got kicked out of Penn.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.699
There's so much I don't know.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.534
Maybe that's a good thing.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.078
No. I mean, like,
how did he pay for all of it?

04:05.120 --> 04:06.788
You saw that house. The
equipment alone would have...

04:06.830 --> 04:08.915
Maybe he had money from before?

04:08.957 --> 04:11.918
No, it reverted
to my parents when he died,

04:11.960 --> 04:14.004
or didn't die.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.634
He came back once.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.970
What if he comes back again?

04:22.012 --> 04:23.930
It was a 100-foot drop.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.974
-They never found the body.
-That river flows

04:26.016 --> 04:28.685
into the Potomac.
They might never find it.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.027
What's going on?

04:37.068 --> 04:39.446
I was gonna call,
but I thought it may be best

04:39.487 --> 04:41.489
to tell you in person.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.408
Tell us what?

04:43.450 --> 04:45.535
It's him, isn't it?

04:52.792 --> 04:54.753
KNOPP
The site's been cleaned.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.088
The CIA woman is
receiving treatment.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.548
And the contractors?

04:58.590 --> 05:00.258
Their families
are being compensated.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.177
How much is this costing me?

05:02.218 --> 05:03.970
That should be low priority.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.681
I wasn't consulted on
this insane plan to start with,

05:06.723 --> 05:08.516
so it's not low priority to me.

05:08.558 --> 05:12.479
The plan was in service of our
larger mission-- to protect...

05:12.520 --> 05:16.524
Don't presume to tell me
about our larger mission.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.610
I was in the group
long before you.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.612
It was quiet then.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.281
No private contractors, no CIA.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.533
That was a time of peace.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.953
Now we find ourselves at war.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.539
Has anyone spoken
to Peter Solomon?

05:31.581 --> 05:32.832
-He should be consulted.
-I don't know

05:32.874 --> 05:35.877
that he's in any state
to be objective.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.003
This is his son.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.922
His son may still have
the artifacts.

05:38.963 --> 05:40.924
In which case,
Peter may have some insight

05:40.965 --> 05:43.426
as to how to get them back...

05:43.468 --> 05:45.428
Paul?

05:46.721 --> 05:48.515
You're frozen.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.028
LANGDON
So Leviathan

06:02.070 --> 06:04.030
took him off the street,
held him in captivity,

06:04.072 --> 06:06.366
so they could get
the pyramid back?

06:06.408 --> 06:09.077
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.246
They got some kind
of private army.

06:11.287 --> 06:14.499
Contractors.
A resource we rarely call on.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.002
Yeah, well, some
of those resources are dead now,

06:17.043 --> 06:18.920
courtesy of Mal'akh
or Zachary or...

06:18.962 --> 06:21.131
She gonna be all right?

06:21.172 --> 06:22.507
Agent Sato?

06:22.549 --> 06:24.509
She'll be all right. I mean,

06:24.551 --> 06:25.844
probably won't ever talk
the same, though.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.221
He just about crushed
her larynx.

06:28.263 --> 06:31.933
If he's still out there, you
guys got to watch your backs.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.436
Mom isn't picking up. I think
I should go check on her.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.188
-He wouldn't hurt your mother.
-You don't know that.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.357
Anyone in this family
could be a target.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.234
Hey, uh, I can get
a squad car sent to her place..

06:41.276 --> 06:43.194
-That's a good idea.
-No, no. No police.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.321
She has a lot of triggers.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.532
You weren't there.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.117
You don't know how bad
it got with her.

06:49.159 --> 06:52.120
-All right, then let's go.
-Dad shouldn't be alone.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.455
It's not safe.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.789
-I'll be okay.
-Jesus!

06:54.831 --> 06:56.207
Am I the only one
taking this seriously?

06:56.249 --> 06:58.209
I got him. I-I can...
I can stay with him.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.878
I mean, if that's okay with you?

07:02.589 --> 07:04.799
Okay.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.052
Yeah, let's go.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.973
It's spread
to everyone on the network.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.808
-A virus?
-A smart one.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.269
Completely locked us out.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.979
Of?

07:18.021 --> 07:20.482
The archives, the central fund.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.525
The central f...

07:23.318 --> 07:25.153
The group is supposed
to be insulated

07:25.195 --> 07:27.322
-from this kind of thing.
-From anything originating

07:27.364 --> 07:29.199
outside the network.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.410
Mal'akh's phone--
it's a Trojan horse.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.246
The moment we cracked it,
it sent the virus in,

07:35.288 --> 07:36.456
locked us out.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.541
So he wanted us to crack it?

07:38.583 --> 07:40.585
Looks like.

07:41.378 --> 07:44.547
But that would mean
he wanted to get caught.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.551
He set all this up.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.888
He's been ahead of us all along.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.398
-We're in.
-You found the money?

08:01.439 --> 08:05.235
The money, the secrets--
their world is your oyster.

08:05.276 --> 08:08.363
Having a hidden network
is a brilliant idea,

08:08.405 --> 08:11.574
right up until someone accesses
your hiding place.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.576
How'd you do that anyway?

08:13.618 --> 08:15.912
Show me the member list.

08:21.126 --> 08:24.796
Him. William Osterman.
Let me see.

08:38.810 --> 08:39.936
What's that?

08:39.978 --> 08:41.771
We're up on their phones, too.

08:41.813 --> 08:46.234
This one's getting a call.
Can even trace it, if you want.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.111
No need.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.613
-Hello.
-It's Peter Solomon.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.115
Peter, I was just
about to reach out.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.075
-Uh, I'm sorry
I didn't earlier.
-Of course.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.994
You were too busy
playing judge and jury.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.581
You were convalescing.
I didn't want to bother you.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.083
-He's my son.
-Yes.

09:02.125 --> 09:05.211
He's also the reason we're in
this situation to begin with.

09:05.253 --> 09:08.506
Well, if you had told me
what you were planning,

09:08.548 --> 09:10.175
I could have warned you.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.845
Is it true
that he killed those men?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.264
Yes, but that's not all.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.308
He's hacked our network.

09:18.350 --> 09:22.062
Frozen the fund, gained access
to our private information,

09:22.103 --> 09:23.855
transaction histories.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.566
He is talented,
I'll give him that.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.985
Do you know why
he is doing this?

09:29.027 --> 09:32.030
I don't know. To create
some point of leverage?

09:32.072 --> 09:35.784
Maybe he just wants
to destroy us.

09:35.825 --> 09:39.704
Somehow I don't think
it's that simple.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.210
Sir, something's happening.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.883
Peter,

09:51.925 --> 09:53.885
we need to meet.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.179
All of us.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.575
She's taken good care
of the place.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.619
It's taken good care of her.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.914
Being out here
kind of saved her.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.383
Mom?

10:36.302 --> 10:38.346
Mom?

11:12.380 --> 11:14.799
Mom?

11:17.552 --> 11:19.012
-Mom.
-Oh, God!

11:19.054 --> 11:20.388
-Sorry.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.848
Didn't hear you.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.850
-Celine.
-Hmm.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.186
It's a nice surprise.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.233
-Robert.
-Hi, Isabel.

11:32.275 --> 11:35.779
What's going on?
The two of you back on?

11:35.820 --> 11:36.863
No.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.948
-Uh-huh.
-Mom.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.950
It's about Zach.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.162
What about him?

11:45.789 --> 11:48.667
Maybe we should go inside
and talk.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.460
That sounds like a perfect idea.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.462
The two of you can stay
for dinner.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.798
No, Mom, we can't stay.
We need to leave.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.633
Katherine, please.

11:56.675 --> 11:59.052
So catch me up, Professor.
How is Harvard?

11:59.094 --> 12:01.513
Zachary's alive.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.018
We don't know
what happened exactly

12:07.060 --> 12:09.229
-or how he did it.
-He had surgery.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.606
His face, uh--
you wouldn't recognize him.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.442
So you've talked to him?

12:14.484 --> 12:15.985
Robert has.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.196
He's different now.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.989
He, um...

12:20.031 --> 12:22.367
He's had a psychotic break, Mom.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.454
It's changed him.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.498
And how long
have you known this?

12:28.540 --> 12:30.375
Not long.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.092
Do you know where he is now?

12:39.134 --> 12:42.387
No. That's why we're here.

12:46.725 --> 12:48.768
I need you to come with us.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.230
He could come here,
and if he does,

12:52.272 --> 12:55.567
-he's dangerous.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.445
My God. Dangerous?

12:58.486 --> 13:00.989
He's done things.
He's hurt people.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.282
-He was the one who was hurt.
-Yes,

13:02.323 --> 13:03.908
he was, but that was before.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.161
And you sound just like before.
You're against him.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.371
This isn't
about taking sides, Mom.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.957
He hurt Dad.

13:11.833 --> 13:14.294
Well, he wouldn't hurt me.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.007
I stood by him. I loved him.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.468
-So did I.
-Isabel, I...

13:21.509 --> 13:24.054
I know this must all be
very overwhelming.

13:24.095 --> 13:25.597
We're still processing it
ourselves,

13:25.638 --> 13:27.140
but I think what Katherine's
trying to say is that

13:27.182 --> 13:28.850
this is not the same Zachary.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.477
Well, forgive me,

13:30.518 --> 13:32.562
but I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.939
And I'm supposed
to be the crazy one here.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.733
You're not crazy, Mom.

13:36.775 --> 13:39.361
I appreciate you saying that,
but if you meant it,

13:39.402 --> 13:42.072
you should trust me enough
to make my own decisions.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.366
I'm not leaving.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.369
Okay.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.038
-Then we'll just stick around
for a while, too.
-Great.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.040
I'll make pasta from scratch,

13:52.082 --> 13:54.584
we'll roast some vegetables
from the garden.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.545
And don't worry, Robert.
No zucchini.

13:59.589 --> 14:03.093
-Good memory.
-I remember everything.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.477
She's in denial.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.813
She's isolated herself
in this fantasy,

14:14.854 --> 14:17.440
and now we're threatening
to tear that away from her.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.777
After dinner, you should
take the car and go.

14:20.819 --> 14:23.196
Totally. I mean,
I'll-I'll just leave you here.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.323
You got the keys?

14:28.952 --> 14:31.204
We're together in this.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.204
Sir?

15:36.895 --> 15:39.356
Hey, hey.

15:40.607 --> 15:44.861
You do know the idea was
to lay low, isolate.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.863
Circumstances have changed.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.615
You don't have to be here.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.910
Well, I told them I'd keep you
safe so, yeah, I kind of do.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.205
Oh, maybe I could sit in
and get some investment advice.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.040
It's not that kind of meeting.

15:57.082 --> 15:58.917
Yeah, I didn't think so.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.961
My son, it appears,

16:02.003 --> 16:04.547
has not finished with me.

16:50.552 --> 16:52.303
PETER
Gentlemen.

16:53.221 --> 16:56.016
I was being held for ransom.

16:56.057 --> 16:59.728
And now it seems you are
being held for ransom, as well.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.898
Shall we begin?

17:22.208 --> 17:23.668
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.879
Yeah.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.902
Hello?

17:48.943 --> 17:50.987
-It's Robert.
-Hey, what's going on?

17:51.029 --> 17:52.364
Uh, is her mom okay?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.115
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:54.157 --> 17:56.201
Well, safe at least.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.203
Everything quiet there?

17:58.244 --> 17:59.537
NUÑ
Not really.

17:59.579 --> 18:03.041
Things are... afoot.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.084
What does that mean?

18:04.125 --> 18:05.710
Those Leviathan dudes--

18:05.752 --> 18:07.504
-they're here.
-What?

18:07.545 --> 18:08.963
It's not like that.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.216
Mr. Solomon invited them.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.009
They got hacked or something.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.552
They think it's Mal'akh.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.596
-Hacked?
-Yeah.

18:16.638 --> 18:18.973
So they're meeting about it.
I guess Zoom wasn't an option,

18:19.015 --> 18:21.101
what, with their accounts
getting lurked on.

18:21.142 --> 18:23.895
-They have any idea
what he took?
-I don't know.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.230
They didn't invite me in.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.399
But from what I can tell,

18:27.440 --> 18:29.818
it's like
a ransomware situation.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.737
-So what's the ransom?
-OSTERMAN Cascade

18:32.779 --> 18:36.324
is a long-range
acoustic technology.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.410
The Chinese were developing it
in secret,

18:38.451 --> 18:42.122
but as we know,
secrets are hard to keep.

18:42.163 --> 18:46.251
So, we have our own program now.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.921
The device can be programmed
with infrasonic frequencies,

18:49.963 --> 18:53.049
which create
atmospheric vibrations.

18:53.091 --> 18:55.427
And why would someone want it?

18:55.468 --> 18:56.761
Its applications
would largely fall

18:56.803 --> 18:59.222
into the anti-personnel bucket.

18:59.264 --> 19:01.266
Crowd control, troop repulsion.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.727
So he wants a weapon?
I don't understand.

19:03.768 --> 19:06.521
-I thought
he was after the ancient wisdom.
-He is.

19:06.563 --> 19:08.606
He was keeping notes

19:08.648 --> 19:13.278
on a vibrational phenomenon,
resonance, but I suspect

19:13.319 --> 19:15.405
he thinks that this device

19:15.447 --> 19:18.742
can help him
achieve apotheosis.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.285
Apotheosis?

19:20.326 --> 19:23.246
-What are you talking about?
-Most of us here believe

19:23.288 --> 19:26.791
that the ancient wisdom
is tangible, is learnable,

19:26.833 --> 19:31.421
an ancient scripture
with which one can train oneself

19:31.463 --> 19:34.632
to unlock latent abilities
of the mind.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.135
He clearly believes

19:37.177 --> 19:39.054
that it is some kind of

19:39.095 --> 19:42.474
metaphysical doorway to godhood.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.935
How would he have arrived
at an idea like that?

19:45.977 --> 19:49.439
How does anyone? Ideas have been
perverted all through history.

19:49.481 --> 19:51.733
It is the world we live in.

19:51.775 --> 19:54.069
No offense, Peter, but
your son's a complete lunatic.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.654
And totally committed.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.657
-We cannot
turn that over to him.
-Oh, no?

19:59.699 --> 20:03.328
This cutting-edge siren is
more important than our money?

20:03.370 --> 20:06.414
-He could wipe out our accounts.
-Not to mention our reputations.

20:06.456 --> 20:09.876
Money and reputations can be
rebuilt, some things can't.

20:09.918 --> 20:12.379
I lost my hand, almost my life.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.464
No one questions
your resolve, Peter.

20:14.506 --> 20:18.009
We took an oath to protect
the wisdom. If our membership

20:18.051 --> 20:20.512
is exposed, we won't
be effective in that role.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.390
If we give him this device,
there is no telling

20:23.431 --> 20:26.267
where it may lead.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.563
We'll put it to a vote.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.734
All those in favor
of turning the device over?

20:42.033 --> 20:44.035
All opposed?

21:07.434 --> 21:09.561
Meeting's over?

21:09.602 --> 21:12.105
So what happened?

21:13.106 --> 21:16.609
Cowardice... won.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.747
The other room seemed fine.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.749
Yeah, I just...
I seem to remember

21:30.790 --> 21:32.959
that it gets pretty bright
in the morning, so...

21:33.001 --> 21:34.669
I'm sure
I'll be up pretty early.

21:34.711 --> 21:37.589
I don't really sleep well
in strange places.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.050
Like the Library of Congress
basement?

21:42.093 --> 21:44.137
Right.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.560
-Cold?
-Yeah. One thing

21:50.602 --> 21:53.605
I will admit
I didn't miss about her leaving.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.857
-She kept the house freezing.
-I could...

21:55.899 --> 21:58.401
I could go
and adjust the thermostat or

21:58.443 --> 21:59.944
find an extra blanket.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.905
Maybe you could just
lie with me?

22:26.680 --> 22:29.015
This could all
totally unravel her.

22:31.226 --> 22:33.395
I'd hate to see her go back
to that place.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.188
I know.

22:35.230 --> 22:37.816
But she needs
to know the truth, right?

22:38.942 --> 22:41.903
I mean, she seems unable
to accept reality,

22:41.945 --> 22:44.406
so, in the end,
maybe it won't matter.

22:44.447 --> 22:46.408
Yeah.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.368
Tens of thousands of years

22:48.410 --> 22:51.663
of disappointment have given us
a powerful ability to deny.

22:52.414 --> 22:54.582
And that's not just
personal experiences,

22:54.624 --> 22:57.669
but utterly provable
historical events.

22:57.711 --> 23:01.506
Like the myth
of the Wehrmacht,

23:01.548 --> 23:04.509
"Historical negationism."

23:04.551 --> 23:06.803
I wrote a paper on it.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.809
Thank you...

23:12.851 --> 23:15.186
for being here.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.734
Of course.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.739
I think
I've been in denial, too.

23:29.784 --> 23:32.495
I hadn't let myself feel

23:32.537 --> 23:34.998
what it would be like to...

23:36.875 --> 23:39.127
...to really lose you.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.262
What are you feeling now?

24:24.214 --> 24:25.548
'48. Good year.

24:25.590 --> 24:26.925
It was actually.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.803
Burma gained independence.

24:29.844 --> 24:32.055
Sri Lanka, also.

24:32.847 --> 24:35.975
Then again,
Gandhi was assassinated.

24:36.017 --> 24:38.520
Yeah, win some, lose some.

24:38.561 --> 24:41.690
Yes. And today, I lost.

24:44.442 --> 24:48.154
We swore an oath
to protect the greater good.

24:48.196 --> 24:52.617
They just want
to protect themselves

24:52.659 --> 24:55.328
from...

24:55.370 --> 24:57.372
Zachary.

24:58.164 --> 25:00.667
You know,
I was always so focused

25:00.709 --> 25:04.504
on what I wanted him to be,

25:04.546 --> 25:07.882
I couldn't see who he was.

25:07.924 --> 25:10.176
But you can't think like that.

25:12.303 --> 25:14.180
Shame, blame,

25:14.222 --> 25:16.558
that little voice
in your head reminding you

25:16.599 --> 25:18.685
what you've done wrong,

25:18.727 --> 25:21.021
how you failed.

25:21.062 --> 25:24.107
Do you have it?

25:24.149 --> 25:27.861
The voice that reminds you.

25:32.907 --> 25:35.243
Felix.

25:38.079 --> 25:40.290
We served together.

25:41.082 --> 25:43.835
Kind of took him under my wing.

25:45.170 --> 25:47.505
He didn't belong there.
I mean, no one belongs

25:47.547 --> 25:49.215
in a place like that, but

25:49.257 --> 25:52.469
you could see it in his eyes
from day one.

25:53.803 --> 25:55.764
What happened to him?

25:55.805 --> 25:58.892
He stepped on a pressure plate.

26:00.518 --> 26:02.896
IED. Right in front of me.

26:02.937 --> 26:06.107
I'm sorry.

26:09.819 --> 26:13.823
You know, I had that voice
under control for a while.

26:14.949 --> 26:17.744
And then, all of a sudden,
all this happens,

26:17.786 --> 26:20.538
and Langdon drops into my life.

26:20.580 --> 26:24.084
Some new guy in some war
he's not ready for.

26:25.377 --> 26:27.796
I had to help.

26:27.837 --> 26:30.965
You are a protector.

26:31.007 --> 26:34.886
Nah, I just...
I do what I have to do.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.014
To Felix.

27:21.349 --> 27:23.601
Did you bring it?

27:26.312 --> 27:28.398
Yes.

27:56.843 --> 27:59.429
What will you do with it?

28:02.891 --> 28:05.101
There's a tracking signal.

28:06.561 --> 28:08.229
Lose it.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.612
Stand down.

28:15.653 --> 28:17.197
Take it off.

29:09.457 --> 29:12.168
ISABEL
Yeah. I...

29:12.210 --> 29:15.213
I got the fertilizer
that you, uh, recommended.

29:15.255 --> 29:18.008
It's made a big difference.

29:18.049 --> 29:20.010
Yeah, it's nice, actually.

29:20.051 --> 29:22.095
It's nice to have the company,
and, uh,

29:22.137 --> 29:27.517
the two of them
are really lovely together.

29:27.559 --> 29:30.103
Yeah.

29:30.145 --> 29:33.064
Oh, you know,
it's just a bunch of nonsense.

29:35.150 --> 29:37.360
Yeah.

31:00.068 --> 31:02.237
Hey.

31:03.071 --> 31:05.532
-Did you get some water?
-Yeah.

31:05.573 --> 31:08.535
I must have forgot it
in the other room.

31:08.576 --> 31:11.121
What?

31:12.455 --> 31:14.374
That alias he was using,

31:14.416 --> 31:17.752
the one you found on the invoice
for that flotation tank...

31:17.794 --> 31:19.629
I was having

31:19.671 --> 31:23.049
a really nice time
not thinking about that.

31:23.091 --> 31:25.343
What was the name?

31:26.720 --> 31:29.305
Abaddon.

31:29.347 --> 31:31.766
Christopher Abaddon. Why?

31:37.605 --> 31:39.607
It was in your mom's office.

31:39.649 --> 31:43.111
It's a wire transfer
from her account.

31:51.369 --> 31:52.996
It was you.

31:53.038 --> 31:55.290
You've been sending him money.

31:57.167 --> 31:59.836
How long has this been going on?

32:01.004 --> 32:03.631
He called me from Turkey
just after the riot.

32:03.673 --> 32:06.134
-He needed surgery.
-And you didn't

32:06.176 --> 32:07.719
think to tell us?

32:07.761 --> 32:09.179
That was our deal.

32:09.220 --> 32:11.806
No one could know.

32:11.848 --> 32:14.684
He said they would
put him back in prison.

32:14.726 --> 32:17.604
I lost him once.

32:17.645 --> 32:20.148
I wasn't gonna lose him again.

32:20.190 --> 32:22.233
Have you seen him?

32:22.275 --> 32:23.485
Mostly, he calls.

32:23.526 --> 32:25.945
He's visited a couple of times.

32:25.987 --> 32:28.323
And you didn't sense
anything off about him?

32:28.365 --> 32:30.909
He looks and sounds
completely different,

32:30.950 --> 32:33.453
but a mother knows her son.

32:33.495 --> 32:37.499
He's on a spiritual quest,
you know.

32:37.540 --> 32:40.335
He... he told you about that?

32:40.377 --> 32:42.962
It's been a nightmare for him.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.716
It's only normal, that given
what he's been through,

32:46.758 --> 32:49.427
that he would want to find
some greater meaning in things.

32:49.469 --> 32:52.263
That is not what he's doing.

32:54.724 --> 32:57.560
Isabel,
have you seen him recently?

33:00.563 --> 33:04.150
Has he given you anything?

33:04.192 --> 33:06.695
You don't know him, Mom.

33:06.736 --> 33:09.030
Oh, of course
you would say that...

33:09.072 --> 33:11.700
He murdered my friend.
He stabbed her,

33:11.741 --> 33:14.452
and he left her body
at the base of a statue

33:14.494 --> 33:17.038
-like some kind
of religious offering.
-Stop it now!

33:17.080 --> 33:18.540
He tortured Dad!

33:18.581 --> 33:20.834
-No!
-Do you hear me?
Peter Solomon, the man

33:20.875 --> 33:23.003
-you married,
the father of your children.
-Stop it!

33:23.044 --> 33:25.422
-He cut off his hand!
-Stop. Stop it now!

33:25.463 --> 33:28.049
Stop it now!

33:28.091 --> 33:31.678
Stop it now.

33:33.722 --> 33:35.974
Stop it now.

33:50.113 --> 33:52.282
SATO
No one needs to know

33:52.323 --> 33:54.451
anything about this.

33:56.995 --> 33:58.413
Mal'akh!

34:02.792 --> 34:04.753
Zachary.

34:06.463 --> 34:09.966
-Are you leaving?
-No. I'll come back this time.

34:11.092 --> 34:14.596
Breith, bás, athbhreithe.

34:23.772 --> 34:25.940
Hey.

34:41.623 --> 34:43.833
Hey, hey.

34:48.463 --> 34:50.674
You're okay.

34:52.842 --> 34:54.594
We're okay.

34:56.137 --> 34:58.139
I'm...

34:58.181 --> 35:00.183
so ashamed.

35:00.225 --> 35:02.227
No.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.354
Don't be.

35:05.480 --> 35:08.358
What... what I've done.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.945
Don't talk. It's okay.

35:30.755 --> 35:32.340
Yeah.

35:32.382 --> 35:37.512
He said you specifically told
him not to reach out to me, but,

35:37.554 --> 35:39.472
"She can keep
her own damn secrets."

35:39.514 --> 35:41.725
His exact words.

35:42.517 --> 35:44.853
Look, you and I
have too much history

35:44.894 --> 35:47.480
to let this get between us.

35:48.690 --> 35:51.693
Assuming you get out
of this bed soon,

35:51.735 --> 35:54.988
we got to figure out
what Blake's been up to.

35:55.030 --> 35:58.742
He's been on the phone
with Istanbul.

36:02.620 --> 36:05.165
He did all of those things?

36:06.541 --> 36:08.918
And Peter--

36:08.960 --> 36:11.087
is he okay?

36:12.714 --> 36:15.717
-He will be.

36:20.221 --> 36:21.973
You have to go.

36:22.015 --> 36:25.810
No. Mom, I told you we're not
going anywhere without you.

36:33.068 --> 36:34.361
He's coming.

36:34.402 --> 36:35.570
What?

36:35.612 --> 36:37.197
I told him you were here.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.115
-You told him?
-Zachary.

36:39.157 --> 36:41.242
I spoke with him earlier.

36:41.284 --> 36:42.702
He's on his way here right now.

36:42.744 --> 36:44.621
-Then you're coming with us.
-No.

36:44.662 --> 36:46.498
-We can't leave you here, Mom.
-Isabel.

36:46.539 --> 36:48.375
-I'm his mother.
-You're my mother, too.

36:48.416 --> 36:50.543
Then you need to listen to me.

36:52.545 --> 36:55.840
I am telling you to leave.

36:55.882 --> 36:59.761
Isabel, with everything
you've just heard?

37:02.555 --> 37:04.974
Katherine?

37:06.810 --> 37:10.188
We need to let her
make her own choice.

37:21.491 --> 37:24.536
It's going to be okay.

37:24.577 --> 37:26.037
-Go.

37:26.079 --> 37:27.580
Wait.

37:27.622 --> 37:29.749
He's hidden something.

37:29.791 --> 37:33.503
I heard him the other night
in the barn.

38:07.203 --> 38:09.080
Where are they?

38:18.381 --> 38:21.134
-They left.
-In the middle of the night?

38:22.218 --> 38:24.971
I told them to go.

38:26.765 --> 38:29.726
What else did you tell them?

38:31.061 --> 38:33.271
They said you've done things.

38:34.272 --> 38:37.067
Are you still my son?

38:39.736 --> 38:43.865
After everything
I've been through,

38:43.907 --> 38:46.284
I am owed the truth.

38:52.290 --> 38:55.543
You don't want the truth.

38:55.585 --> 38:58.296
You never have.

39:07.263 --> 39:09.432
My boy.

39:09.474 --> 39:11.726
-He's gone.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.582
How was your flight?

40:57.624 --> 41:00.502
It's been a long journey,

41:00.543 --> 41:00.669
and it's far from over.
