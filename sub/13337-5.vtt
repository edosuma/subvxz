WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.320
.

00:06.960 --> 00:10.560
The Geordies are back. We're leaving
the Toon and hitting Greece.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.920
Greece, you're about to get done.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.760
(cheering)

00:15.840 --> 00:17.360
Come on!

00:18.760 --> 00:20.360
It's gonna be pool parties...

00:20.440 --> 00:22.200
Boat parties...

00:23.000 --> 00:24.160
More drama.

00:25.520 --> 00:26.880
Fuck this shit!

00:28.680 --> 00:30.480
More tashing on.

00:32.680 --> 00:34.240
More fucking tragedy.

00:35.560 --> 00:36.560
Slag!

00:36.640 --> 00:37.960
(shouting)

00:38.040 --> 00:39.560
(exhales heavily)

00:39.640 --> 00:42.120
Don't fucking ever
speak to me again.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.240
(sobbing)

00:43.320 --> 00:45.280
(spits)

00:45.360 --> 00:46.880
Total carnage.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.760
Fuck! Shit! What have I done now?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.800
And a shitload of bucking, like.

00:59.920 --> 01:04.480
Greece, the Geordie gods are coming.
Time to get immortal.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.480
P-A-R-T-E-Y.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.240
Party!

01:15.320 --> 01:17.640
Again, everyone's pulled bar me.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.920
Scott pulled.
It's made me really jealous.

01:24.320 --> 01:26.440
Yous two just need to
fucking split up.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.960
I can't put you through this anymore.
You're breaking up with us?

01:30.040 --> 01:32.240
Yeah.
He's ended it.

01:32.320 --> 01:35.880
'And if he gets with anybody else
it's going to break my heart.'

01:38.320 --> 01:41.840
Kyle's just kissed a girl. It's
about time she fucking found out.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.520
What a fucking wanker!

01:48.040 --> 01:50.160
Marnie has shit-stirred this
right up.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.120
(shouts unintelligibly)

01:52.200 --> 01:54.880
Why deny something
when I blatantly seen it?

01:57.360 --> 01:58.800
World War fucking three.

02:03.280 --> 02:05.400
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.920
I've never kissed anyone
without a six-pack.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.400
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:10.480 --> 02:12.600
Get in cos I'm going
to tear the place up.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.760
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.520
I'm preened to perfection.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.120
I'm cheeky, colourful,
and full of mischief.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.920
I'm fit, flirty and I've got FFs.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.400
I'll make sparks fly
and get everyone feisty.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.520
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:41.920 --> 02:44.440
Last night
was an absolute train wreck.

02:44.520 --> 02:48.560
Holly got finished by Kyle, and
then me and Holly went home early

02:48.640 --> 02:52.280
to then be woken up by Marnie
who's screaming and shouting,

02:52.360 --> 02:54.200
saying Kyle kissed another girl.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.000
Couldn't have went more wrong.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.880
Me and Holly broke up. She was just
really upset about everything.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.920
She was just... She's emotional,
you know what I mean?

03:03.000 --> 03:08.440
I love Holly to bits, I always have,
but this isn't working between us.

03:08.520 --> 03:11.280
The right person at the wrong time.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.760
Went out, and you never go on
a night out with your exes,

03:15.840 --> 03:20.200
so it was hard and then I kissed
a girl. Marnie took it the wrong way.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.480
It was just a kiss hello.
It was nothing.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.800
It was literally fucking nothing,
man.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.320
I'm explaining to the lads

03:26.400 --> 03:29.000
that it wasn't even
a proper kiss off this girl.

03:29.080 --> 03:32.040
Schoolboy error, mate.
Fucking hell, man.

03:32.120 --> 03:35.720
He kissed a girl on the same day
that he finished Holly. Brave man.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.960
I just wish I could click me fingers
and make her not love us,

03:39.040 --> 03:40.720
but that's just not the case.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.040
How do you feel about it then, Hols?

03:44.120 --> 03:46.280
I need to accept that it's over,

03:46.360 --> 03:49.720
but while I'm in here and I've got
to look at him and talk about him

03:49.800 --> 03:53.760
and see him every single minute
of the day, I can't get over him.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.560
I want to run away
and get away from this situation.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.440
I don't know how to get through it.

03:58.520 --> 04:01.120
I appreciate you telling us, Marn.
Thank you.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.520
I know it put you
in a proper awful position.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.720
'He's making me out to be a liar
when he's in the wrong.'

04:06.800 --> 04:10.840
I'm being a good friend and a good
person. He's a fucking dickhead!

04:10.920 --> 04:15.280
The things he's saying... I don't
know what he's saying is the truth.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.120
I don't know who to believe.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.000
(phone rings)

04:28.040 --> 04:30.680
Fuck! I know it's Anna.
I'm in trouble, like.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.840
Aye, I know. Sorry about that.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.880
Last night, the way I acted
wasn't cool and I got too angry.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.600
'I've got to clean the villa.'

04:47.680 --> 04:50.680
To make things worse,
I've got to clean it with Marnie.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.600
Hello.
Hello, Marnie.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.080
I can't throw things.
It's out of order.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.280
They have been punished
for last night.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.320
They have to clean the house.
Sucks to be you!

05:04.800 --> 05:07.480
What the fuck?
We can still go, boys.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.240
'Kyle can't come for a drink.'

05:10.320 --> 05:13.400
Fucking nightmare for the kid.
I'm off, me.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.680
'Fuck arguments.
This is what it's about.'

05:34.760 --> 05:37.560
Cocktails, shots
and a fucking bar on the beach.

05:39.720 --> 05:44.600
It's the middle of the day
and people are drinking at the beach.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.120
This is what I'm about.

05:55.040 --> 05:58.960
I still haven't pulled. What the
fuck's going on? I've lost my mojo.

06:08.640 --> 06:11.400
He hasn't pulled yet.
He's with the big boys now

06:11.480 --> 06:14.200
If he doesn't step his game up,
he'll get crushed.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.960
I'll slap my tits on someone!

06:28.880 --> 06:31.720
'Anna thinks by making us
clean the villa together,

06:31.800 --> 06:33.480
we'll miraculously make up.'

06:33.560 --> 06:37.280
I literally would rather lick
this floor than talk to him again.

06:37.360 --> 06:40.320
'She's not speaking to me.
I'm not speaking to her.'

06:40.400 --> 06:42.560
It looks like we'll clean in silence.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.720
'That's fine by me.'

06:50.880 --> 06:53.920
I do feel a bit sorry for Marns
having to clean the house.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.320
She doesn't like cleaning,
especially not now with Kyle.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.440
There's been so much drama lately,

06:59.520 --> 07:02.840
I just hope that we can finally
take Holly's mind off Kyle.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.680
'Let's go to the beach...'
OK.

07:04.760 --> 07:08.560
...and drink cocktails all day
until we're so drunk we can't walk.

07:08.640 --> 07:09.760
I'm game for that.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.560
We're going on a fun day out.
Hopefully I'll be able

07:12.640 --> 07:15.600
to keep a smile on my face
for more than three seconds.

07:15.680 --> 07:16.760
Maybe not.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.720
(laughter)

07:22.680 --> 07:23.760
(laughter)

07:37.200 --> 07:39.720
Oh, yes, buzzing about this.

07:39.800 --> 07:40.960
I'm in a better mood.

07:41.040 --> 07:44.840
Drinking a strawberry daiquiri,
what more could I ask for?

07:44.920 --> 07:47.120
You've been finished...
Yeah.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.120
...but I feel like
there's been other bad things

07:50.200 --> 07:52.680
have happened to us
in our lifetime together.

07:52.760 --> 07:57.960
What about when we first all came
together and everyone hated you,

07:58.040 --> 08:00.520
and you were pushed out
of the group?

08:00.600 --> 08:03.760
OK, I'll drink to that.
That was a pretty bad time.

08:03.840 --> 08:07.400
'I feel what's happening now is
the worst thing I've gone through.'

08:07.480 --> 08:10.320
She's trying to cheer me up
by telling me worse things.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.600
You had that awful purple hair.
It was rank.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.440
I thought you liked it.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.200
That wasn't bad.
That was embarrassing.

08:19.480 --> 08:23.560
Celebrating all the shit things
that happened. Cheers!

08:23.640 --> 08:29.400
What about when I told Gary I loved
him and he never said it back?

08:29.480 --> 08:31.800
It's all right.
Kyle never said it to me!

08:48.800 --> 08:50.120
Sound!

08:51.120 --> 08:54.760
'This beach bar is pure bouncing.
Birds fucking everywhere.'

08:54.840 --> 08:58.440
They'll all be buzzing, them.
Sun, sea and Scottie fucking T!

09:03.360 --> 09:06.960
Girls fucking everywhere.
Once again, no-one's pulled.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.240
(laughs)

09:15.440 --> 09:17.360
So, how are you feeling now, Hol?

09:17.440 --> 09:20.400
For him to have apparently
kissed a girl last night,

09:20.480 --> 09:22.520
honestly, I don't know
what I believe.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.640
Marnie wouldn't lie,
but I don't want to turn to Kyle

09:25.720 --> 09:28.800
and say you're lying because
I don't know. I wasn't there.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.120
I believe Marnie hands down.

09:31.200 --> 09:35.280
Marnie's got no reason to lie and
Kyle has got every reason to lie.

09:35.360 --> 09:38.640
I think it's a bit out of order,
even talking to another girl.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.720
He'd never have did it
if you were there

09:40.800 --> 09:43.040
cos he knows how upset
you would have been.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.840
He shouldn't have disrespected me
and spoke to another girl.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.280
That makes us feel sick.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.920
My head is fucked and my heart
is totally broken,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.560
and I don't know
what I'm supposed to do anymore.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.720
If he can do that,
then do you know what?

09:55.800 --> 09:59.320
That makes this break-up much easier
because it makes me realise

09:59.400 --> 10:02.040
that the person I thought he was
is a complete lie.

10:02.120 --> 10:06.320
The penny has finally dropped. She
has realised what a mug she's been.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.880
I'm weeing.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.560
Are you weeing?
Mm-hm.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.880
Are you actually weeing? Let me see.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.600
Oh.
Oh!

10:15.680 --> 10:17.840
I thought you had a wax!

10:17.920 --> 10:19.560
I did. It's grown back.

10:19.640 --> 10:22.280
Awful. Shall we get out now?

10:33.320 --> 10:35.600
Good day, then?
Nah, fucking shite.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.400
(laughter)

10:41.560 --> 10:45.480
'Me and Holly's had a great day.
We got drunk, we got naked.'

10:45.560 --> 10:48.280
The only thing we didn't do
is finger each other,

10:48.360 --> 10:51.080
but there's still time!

10:58.720 --> 11:03.440
I feel like I need you to help me
tonight to pull someone, boy or girl.

11:03.520 --> 11:07.360
I've been struggling even to get
a kiss. It's lowering my self-esteem.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.480
How are you not pulling?

11:10.560 --> 11:13.960
I keep getting pied,
left, right and centre.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.400
It's a bloody joke.

11:15.480 --> 11:19.120
It's time I got some proper help.
Gary, will you help us?

11:19.200 --> 11:22.960
You've got the option of boys and
girls. You should be having it off.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.960
I will get you
a boy or a girl tonight.

11:25.040 --> 11:28.520
You'd think with Nathan having
the choice of boys and girls,

11:28.600 --> 11:30.560
he'd be winning this competition.

11:30.640 --> 11:35.360
I'm not going to lie. Boys isn't
really my field of expertise, yeah,

11:35.440 --> 11:37.600
but I could adapt.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.560
(Charlotte)I'm so excited.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.360
I'm a bit nervous.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.560
We're going to ignore Kyle
and be there for you all night.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.360
Yeah.
'In support of Holly,'

11:52.440 --> 11:56.440
none of the girls will speak to Kyle,
not that I'm going to find that hard.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.880
He has no regard
for my feelings whatsoever,

11:58.960 --> 12:01.960
but the worst thing that I can do
is show him I'm bothered.

12:02.040 --> 12:05.040
I know that I've got to stay strong
and not speak to him.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.200
It is the only way.

12:23.640 --> 12:26.920
Once you become single,
you get a weight off your shoulder.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.200
I'm just going to be civil to her,
but just kind of stay away from her.

12:31.280 --> 12:34.120
To be honest, how often
do you go out with your ex?

12:34.200 --> 12:36.560
'Fuck me! This is going to be hard.'

12:42.000 --> 12:45.560
Holly and Kyle broke up last night.
Since then, no-one's pulled

12:45.640 --> 12:49.560
because they have put a fucking
curse on this stinking villa.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.040
And 3, 2, 1. Top slags!

12:51.120 --> 12:53.720
Fucking buzzing for tonight.
Let's hit the club.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.080
'We get to Rescue.'

13:08.160 --> 13:11.280
We all look swanky as fuck
and I couldn't wait to dance.

13:18.760 --> 13:22.120
Everyone's looking fresh as fuck.
Let's go fucking ballistic.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.920
It doesn't bother us
when Scott flirts with us.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.720
It's like me guilty pleasure.

13:52.240 --> 13:55.080
Marnie reckons she'll help us
find someone to pull.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.400
Get in the bathroom
and look in the mirror.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.320
You'll see I want to dust your tits.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.360
Marnie's trying to talk about Chloe
but I'm thinking,

14:05.440 --> 14:08.760
one day, one day,
you're going to fucking get it, you.

14:13.160 --> 14:16.480
'Why can't Scott dance with me
like he's dancing with Marnie?'

14:16.560 --> 14:20.040
I get so jealous.
She doesn't even want him. I do!

14:33.760 --> 14:36.240
First thing I see
is the girl I pecked.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.880
'Just my fucking luck.'

14:37.960 --> 14:39.880
Uh-oh! Here comes trouble.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.840
'Fuck's sake!
The girl Kyle kissed is here.'

14:53.920 --> 14:57.520
I'm putting on a brave face but
inside I'm feeling so fucking upset.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.920
It looks like everyone's spotted
that lass. Fuck's sake!

15:01.000 --> 15:03.680
'Kyle, stand there,
try not to flirt.'

15:03.760 --> 15:05.480
In fact, don't even talk.

15:07.920 --> 15:11.000
So, Kyle, you can't pull,
you can't talk to Holly,

15:11.080 --> 15:13.880
you can't have a laugh.
What is the point of you, mate?

15:13.960 --> 15:15.640
Might as well fucking gan home.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.240
'Nathan points a bird out
that he wants me to pull for him.'

15:27.320 --> 15:30.880
He's putting me to the test here,
but do not worry. I've got this.

15:30.960 --> 15:33.280
Me fucking wings are ready. Heh-heh!

15:48.000 --> 15:51.960
I found myself a little cheeky
brunette. Tonight is getting better.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.880
Me and Aaron aren't messing about.
We get stuck straight in there.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.680
'Gary is a man of his word.
This girl is hot.'

16:15.760 --> 16:18.600
I need to remain calm
and not fuck this up for myself.

16:20.920 --> 16:24.080
Why are you talking to her?
I've already done that for you.

16:24.160 --> 16:27.880
All you've got to do is fucking
kiss her. How hard can it be?

16:30.520 --> 16:32.840
We're necking on!
I've got my mojo back.

16:33.840 --> 16:38.080
My work here is done.
I am off. Heh-heh!

16:39.320 --> 16:41.000
(Kyle) The lads have pulled,

16:41.080 --> 16:45.360
but I'm just going to stand in the
corner by myself cos it's safe here.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.960
Kyle has no-one to speak to,
and you know what, Kyle?

16:50.040 --> 16:51.160
I don't fucking care.

16:51.240 --> 16:54.520
'Tonight's been wicked
and I've necked on with someone.'

16:54.600 --> 16:58.160
I'm kind of back in the game, but
I don't want to get ahead of myself,

16:58.240 --> 17:00.120
so I'm going home with my hand.

17:07.320 --> 17:09.360
Tonight has been absolutely wicked.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.760
Time to take two birds home
and rattle them all over the shop.

17:19.480 --> 17:23.560
I've pulled. Scott's pulled. It
looks like a race to the shag pad.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.880
'Game on. I'm in first.'

17:25.960 --> 17:27.240
Fuck you, Scott.

17:27.320 --> 17:31.040
What he's too think to realise is he
only gets the shag pad for an hour.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.640
I get it for the rest of the night.
Unlucky, kid!

17:41.680 --> 17:46.560
Gary's saying it's a curse. It's
only 24 hours since they broke up.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.760
I'm not sure Holly's
going to like this.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.120
Gary, I can fucking hear you!

17:55.200 --> 17:56.760
Gary, you're pissing me off!

17:56.840 --> 17:59.760
Exactly.
So it's not us making a curse.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.680
Holly, every time
someone mentions you and Kyle,

18:02.760 --> 18:05.600
you get defensive.
You need to hear some home truths.

18:05.680 --> 18:08.480
Accept the truth.
You shouldn't be together!

18:08.560 --> 18:09.680
We're not together.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.760
My emotions are running wild
and I've had a drink.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.480
I'm ready to fucking kick off.

18:22.320 --> 18:25.720
What truth? What fucking truth?
You tell me the fucking truth.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.840
Sooner you accept it,
you get over it.

18:27.920 --> 18:32.240
Never, ever try and call yourself
my brother! Fuck off!

18:32.320 --> 18:35.960
He's meant to be like a brother.
Why the hell is he not on my side?

18:36.040 --> 18:37.080
Slag!

18:37.160 --> 18:40.840
Fucking stupid little cunt. Don't
you fucking dare call... Fuck off!

18:40.920 --> 18:43.360
Don't! Holly!
Aaron, fuck...

18:43.440 --> 18:47.720
Fucking hell! I am trying to bang.
Will you please keep the noise down?

18:49.120 --> 18:50.320
How fucking dare you!

18:50.400 --> 18:51.960
(Gary) You fucking idiot!

18:52.040 --> 18:54.840
No-one is gonna calm me down.
I'm like a raging bull.

18:54.920 --> 18:57.320
(all shouting)

18:57.400 --> 19:00.160
What the hell?!
We're on holiday, man!

19:00.240 --> 19:02.160
Fucking daft ****! Fuck off!

19:02.240 --> 19:04.760
How come every time
that I bring a bird back,

19:04.840 --> 19:08.680
everyone decides to kick off?
Divn't worry, darling. Daddy's here.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.920
(indistinct)Fuck off, Kyle.
You were on his side there.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.920
I wasn't on his side.
Yes, you were.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.040
As much as I want to stay away,
I can't watch Gary scream at Holly.

19:19.120 --> 19:21.360
I'm not arguing with you. Listen...

19:21.440 --> 19:23.720
No! You listen
to fucking me for once.

19:23.800 --> 19:27.080
I am fucking raging tonight
and, unfortunately for Kyle,

19:27.160 --> 19:28.680
he is now in the firing line.

19:28.760 --> 19:33.000
You will never get away from this
as long as me and you are here!

19:33.080 --> 19:36.560
You will stand here
and you will fucking talk to me.

19:36.640 --> 19:41.120
I fucking understand that me and you
are never going to be together.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.560
I understand that and that
is fucking killing us and all.

19:44.640 --> 19:48.440
Right now, I am the victim.
I am the one who has had to listen

19:48.520 --> 19:50.880
to people telling me
he kissed another girl.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.880
This is why you broke up with us.

19:52.960 --> 19:56.080
This is why you necked on
with someone two seconds after.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.440
I never.
Yes, you did!

19:57.520 --> 19:59.480
Why is Marnie lying, then?
What?

19:59.560 --> 20:02.440
Why would she lie?
I never necked on with anyone.

20:02.520 --> 20:06.360
'Me and Chloe are watching through
the window at them arguing.'

20:06.440 --> 20:08.920
It's like some kind of silent movie.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.160
(mouths)

20:12.240 --> 20:16.480
Do you not think that kills us?
You have broke my heart.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.880
I don't know why Holly
is obsessed with Kyle.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.960
He's got shit crack
and he thinks he's (indistinct).

20:22.040 --> 20:23.120
No, you're not, son.

20:23.200 --> 20:27.320
But the fact of the matter is
you could not deal with my past,

20:27.400 --> 20:30.240
and do you know what, Kyle?
That is absolutely fine.

20:30.320 --> 20:33.640
My past is never going to go away.
It is always going to be there.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.520
You couldn't handle it then.
You can't handle it now.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.680
Get over it. Get a fucking grip.

20:38.760 --> 20:41.120
OK, I'll get over it.
See you later. Bye.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.960
Holly and Kyle are arguing again.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.760
I'm not getting involved.
I'm going to bed.

20:53.760 --> 20:57.400
We'll always have her back until
she starts acting like a lunatic,

20:57.480 --> 20:59.760
like this,
and then what can you say?

20:59.840 --> 21:03.200
It's affecting her relationship
with everyone else in here.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.960
None of us can talk sense
into her anymore.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.600
One person's happy and one's not.
You should not bring mischief.

21:09.680 --> 21:13.680
How is it that it's ended up me and
Gary sitting at the end of the night

21:13.760 --> 21:16.040
critiquing other relationships

21:16.120 --> 21:19.040
as if we're some kind of
couple of the year?

21:19.120 --> 21:20.720
Hypocrites.

21:25.320 --> 21:26.560
I'm done. Swapsies.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.240
Come on, darling,
Let's cuddle in the boys' room.

21:32.720 --> 21:36.360
(sobs) You want a girl like that?
You want that?!

21:36.440 --> 21:39.440
I had a girl like that.
Me?

21:39.520 --> 21:43.520
You've done that before so what's the
problem? Cos you've done that before.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.240
I dunno why Holly
is being so judgemental.

21:46.320 --> 21:49.440
She has done exactly
what that girl's done in the past.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.520
So you haven't walked out of
a room with Aaron, and Scott,

21:52.600 --> 21:55.720
and the rest of them? Yes, you have.
No, you have! You have.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.480
If that's the type of girl
I used to be, then fine,

21:58.560 --> 22:00.040
but I changed for Kyle.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.800
If he wants to go back to that,
that is fine by me.

22:05.160 --> 22:08.720
Reet, it's my turn in the shag pad,
but before I flip this bird over,

22:08.800 --> 22:11.280
I'm flipping this mattress
cos there's nae way

22:11.360 --> 22:15.240
I'm having Aaron's crabs crawling
all over us, snipping me balls off.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.240
I have to finish...
You get...

22:20.320 --> 22:21.520
Get off me. Get off me.

22:21.600 --> 22:24.600
I just seem to cause
more and more trouble for Holly,

22:24.680 --> 22:25.920
so I need to go to bed.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.880
Don't, we'll cry in bed together.
We'll cry together.

22:29.960 --> 22:32.280
Tonight has been
another horrific night.

22:32.360 --> 22:35.680
Not only did I argue with Kyle,
but I argued with Gary as well.

22:35.760 --> 22:38.960
I don't know how this
is ever going to get better.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.400
(Scott) I had a pure mint night
last night.

22:57.480 --> 23:00.680
Met a bird, got a shag and
didn't have any arguments. Sound!

23:00.760 --> 23:03.880
I'm so pleased I got a bang.
Wicked night, wicked bang.

23:07.960 --> 23:11.040
The girl I pulled looked
a bit like Marnie, which was weird.

23:11.120 --> 23:14.040
It's weirder that Scott didn't try
and pull her off us.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.800
Credit to Nathan.
He's off the mark, got necked on.

23:22.840 --> 23:25.000
Once again, the whole night out

23:25.080 --> 23:28.040
was hijacked by a fucking
Kyle and Holly argument.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.840
Everyone's getting sick of it.

23:29.920 --> 23:33.280
Ah, flip, she was fucking
doing my fucking nut in.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.680
She's lost the plot.
She needs to fuck off.

23:35.760 --> 23:38.320
She's absolutely fucking broken.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.040
I thought breaking up
would stop the arguments,

23:41.120 --> 23:43.720
but they keep happening,
together or not.

23:43.800 --> 23:46.800
I was so happy. I was dancing.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.160
Then I got back here
and I just snapped.

23:49.240 --> 23:54.640
Last night was going so well, but I
ended up arguing with Gary and Kyle.

23:54.720 --> 23:58.440
I think we should get out today and
do something fun, just the girls.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.200
Getting out of the house
is a brilliant idea,

24:01.280 --> 24:02.920
as long as the boys don't come.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.440
# Oh, we're going to the beach

24:05.520 --> 24:07.880
(all) # Oh, we're going to the beach

24:07.960 --> 24:10.400
# Oh, we're going to the beach #

24:10.480 --> 24:12.000
'We need to have some fun.'

24:12.080 --> 24:14.920
Let's get out, away from the lads
and go to the beach.

24:23.040 --> 24:24.080
Fuck off, man.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.880
Tonight, we'll be laughing
while they're crying.

24:26.960 --> 24:30.080
We're gonna shag some birds,
evens fucking Kyle.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.320
(laughter)

24:32.400 --> 24:34.440
We're going to have
a pure wicked time

24:34.520 --> 24:38.120
without all the girls
pecking wor fucking heads off.

24:44.760 --> 24:48.840
# We're going to the beach!
We're going to have fun!

24:48.920 --> 24:53.840
# We are going to teach Holly
How to not be glum! Yahoo! #

25:09.880 --> 25:11.800
Just my luck, there's no fit boys.

25:11.880 --> 25:14.320
I've seen a banana boat
and I'm dying for a ride.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.400
'This banana boat is unreal!'

25:20.480 --> 25:25.040
We need to combine our clits
to create multiple orgasms

25:25.120 --> 25:27.000
for everyone to enjoy.

25:27.080 --> 25:30.440
Whoo! I love big bananas!

25:30.520 --> 25:35.160
It's like riding a giant penis,
and the best thing about it

25:35.240 --> 25:39.680
is you can only get physically hurt
on the banana boat, not emotionally.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.560
Ow, me bumhole!

25:48.640 --> 25:49.800
Ow!

25:51.480 --> 25:55.000
What is this stuff
coming out of my arse?

25:55.080 --> 26:00.240
The whole bumhole was stretching
and water was just piling into it.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.480
Fucking hell! You've gone
and given yourself a colonic.

26:03.560 --> 26:06.640
I can make it squirt so far. Watch.

26:06.720 --> 26:09.120
Charlotte's had
an absolute nightmare.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.760
Her arsehole is proper kicking off.
It's leaking like a drainpipe!

26:15.000 --> 26:18.960
# We've been to the beach
We've had a lot of fun

26:19.040 --> 26:23.040
# We've rode a big banana
I got water stuck up me bum #

26:23.120 --> 26:25.200
Cleaning the colon. Come on, then.

26:44.040 --> 26:46.960
'I am having such
a fucking blast with the boys.'

26:47.040 --> 26:49.120
I love these guys so much.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.360
Shall we just do it now? Come on.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.520
There's no girls here.
Let's go out before they come back.

26:59.600 --> 27:02.720
Wicked! Come on, then.
Bagsy first shower!

27:13.360 --> 27:16.760
We have had a wicked day and
nothing is going to bring us down.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.840
(girls chant)

27:18.920 --> 27:20.840
They walk in screaming, chatting,

27:20.920 --> 27:23.920
acting like they've had
the best day ever. Fuck off.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.080
This is your first night single.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.480
I'm absolutely buzzing. I can't wait.

27:33.560 --> 27:36.880
I'm pure shaking with anticipation.
Let's go wild.

27:36.960 --> 27:39.080
(whispers)
The girls have got no idea.

27:39.160 --> 27:43.320
We'll get the fuck out, all the lads
on the pull. I can't fucking wait!

27:43.400 --> 27:45.680
Fuck them.
We're going out to have a frisk.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.920
'It's just us, man.
It's so much better.'

27:48.000 --> 27:51.200
We'll have a wicked lads' night.
We're going to Linekers.

27:51.280 --> 27:55.880
Are my ears hearing right?
A lads' night out!

27:55.960 --> 27:57.840
If that's how they want to play...

27:57.920 --> 27:59.760
(blows raspberry)

28:05.080 --> 28:07.560
We need to sneak out
without them realising,

28:07.640 --> 28:11.640
but I'm canny big
and I make a canny bit of noise. Ssh.

28:13.680 --> 28:17.200
This feels so bad,
but it needs to be done.

28:17.280 --> 28:20.240
I've just overheard the lads

28:20.320 --> 28:24.800
saying that it's lads' night tonight
and they're all going to Linekers.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.760
And they're not telling us?

28:26.840 --> 28:28.080
Fucking tramps.

28:28.160 --> 28:30.480
'We're a family.
We all go out together.'

28:30.560 --> 28:32.080
They're a bunch of wankers.

28:32.160 --> 28:34.560
Why don't we just go out
and gatecrash them?

28:34.640 --> 28:37.600
'Charlotte has got
some really clever ideas.'

28:37.680 --> 28:41.200
I wish I was that clever.
She must have been to university.

28:41.280 --> 28:45.360
They will fucking shit themselves.
They won't know what's hit them.

28:58.360 --> 29:00.160
(laughter)

29:01.800 --> 29:04.320
(cheering)

29:07.480 --> 29:10.320
I'm actually buzzing
for me first lads' night out.

29:10.400 --> 29:13.160
Single in Greece. Come on then!

29:22.280 --> 29:24.840
Kyle, this is the night
you've been dreaming of.

29:24.920 --> 29:28.640
It's just you and the lads
out on the pull, no girls in sight.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.920
I'm so glad
I've got the girls' support.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.680
The boys aren't gonna know
what's hit them.

29:47.760 --> 29:50.200
Come on, let's go. Killer bitches!

29:50.280 --> 29:51.560
(laughter)

29:59.560 --> 30:01.800
'There is loads of fit birds.'

30:01.880 --> 30:03.720
My dick is booting off!

30:07.800 --> 30:11.640
I am on fucking fire tonight.
Girls, someone hose us doon.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.600
We're having a fucking mint night

30:21.680 --> 30:24.960
and I feel like old Kyle
is fucking back.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.000
This is what I've been missing.

30:34.280 --> 30:38.280
Tonight, we're doing what lads
in Zante should be fucking doing.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.120
'I can't wait for this.'

30:48.200 --> 30:51.520
When we walk in that club,
the lads will shit themselves.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.200
Oh, right! This is what is was like
to be single.

30:55.280 --> 30:59.160
In a perfect world, I would love
to be able to walk into that club,

30:59.240 --> 31:02.360
see Scott and Aaron necking on
with girls, Kyle by himself.

31:05.040 --> 31:07.640
I feel nervous. I feel numb.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.040
'I feel sick.'

31:13.800 --> 31:15.960
Kyle, you're a fucking cunt!

31:21.000 --> 31:24.160
We're in Linekers,
the lads doing their thing.

31:24.240 --> 31:27.760
Kyle's necking on with a girl.
Holly's walked in and seen him.

31:27.840 --> 31:28.960
Agh!

31:32.240 --> 31:34.720
He's necking on with a girl!
I fucking knew it.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.440
'He's a fucking bastard.'

31:37.560 --> 31:40.040
Shit! This is fucking awkward.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.920
This is fucking hilarious!

31:48.000 --> 31:49.480
Fuck's sake, man.

31:50.960 --> 31:53.920
My heart has been broken
into a million pieces

31:54.000 --> 31:57.440
but I can't show him that because
then he'll know he's won.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.440
I don't know how Holly's
kept this together,

32:04.520 --> 32:06.600
but I am so proud of her.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.760
Oh!

32:10.840 --> 32:12.920
'And he still continues to do it.'

32:13.000 --> 32:15.640
And he knows that I'm there
because he looked over.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.720
I'm single.
I can do what I want now.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.520
If I want to pull, I can pull.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.680
He's already all over that girl.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.200
High five, mate.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.640
'They can all do one.'

32:33.720 --> 32:37.120
Kyle does not need any more
encouragement being a dickhead.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.760
He can do that job by hisself.

32:38.840 --> 32:41.200
He finished Holly
cos he wants to pull girls.

32:41.280 --> 32:44.760
It's not our fault they chose
to come and see with their own eyes.

32:44.840 --> 32:49.160
'If Kyle had done that to me,
I would be in jail.'

32:49.240 --> 32:53.600
I wouldn't be passing go and
I wouldn't be collecting 200 pound.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.320
I would be in jail for life.

32:56.320 --> 32:57.920
Kyle!

32:58.000 --> 32:59.120
She's swilling him!

32:59.200 --> 33:03.280
What the fuck has this got to do
with Charlotte? Fuck off, darlin'!

33:03.360 --> 33:07.640
What the hell?! I'm going home now,
so it doesn't matter if I'm wet.

33:07.720 --> 33:11.200
Your makeup's
running down your face. Freak!

33:15.600 --> 33:19.280
That was the quickest night of all
time. I didn't get myself a shot.

33:23.240 --> 33:26.320
'What do girls do
when they get fucked over by lads?'

33:26.400 --> 33:28.080
We fuck with their stuff.

33:28.160 --> 33:31.760
It's a race against time.
The boys could be back any second.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.280
I want Kyle to know
how we really feel about him

33:34.360 --> 33:38.000
and because I'm not speaking to him,
we'll write it all over his bed.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.360
I think I'm going to write cunt.
Go on, then.

33:42.560 --> 33:44.000
Two-faced.

33:44.080 --> 33:46.280
Revenge is sweet!

33:46.360 --> 33:48.640
I've gone with sheep
cos he looks like one.

33:48.720 --> 33:50.560
He's trying to be a lad
and he's not.

33:50.640 --> 33:52.400
Didn't want it to come to this.

33:52.480 --> 33:55.440
'When he broke up with me,
he told me he wouldn't hurt me.'

33:55.520 --> 33:56.920
'He's done the opposite.'

33:57.000 --> 33:59.600
The most important word
for me here is liar.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.600
What? That's not how you spell it!

34:02.680 --> 34:05.600
Yes, it is.
It's not. It's an "a".

34:05.680 --> 34:07.240
It's an "a".
Yeah.

34:07.320 --> 34:08.960
No, it's not.
It is!

34:10.200 --> 34:12.640
Is that how you spell liar?
I don't think it is.

34:12.720 --> 34:14.760
Wait, let us look at it
from that side.

34:14.840 --> 34:18.040
Li-er.
Luh, a... Luh, ay, a, ruh.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.120
I just wish that
the revengeful words

34:20.200 --> 34:24.080
weren't so long and complicated.
None of us can spell them.

34:24.160 --> 34:26.640
It won't be effective
if we've spelt it wrong.

34:26.720 --> 34:29.680
How do you rub this off?
We could cut the bit of sheet out.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.120
I can do it. I can do it.

34:31.200 --> 34:33.560
You look like you'll
chop your finger off.

34:33.640 --> 34:37.040
Oh, wait! Wait.
I've got some tit tape here.

34:38.280 --> 34:41.880
That was a mint idea.
Shit, how autographic.

34:41.960 --> 34:44.080
I cannot wait to see Kyle's face.

34:44.160 --> 34:46.760
He deserves everything he gets.
Yeah, he does.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.960
Let's go downstairs and get a drink.

35:00.480 --> 35:03.080
There's nae chance
the girls will ruin our night.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.600
We're going to party on
and get fucked. Oi, oi.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.440
'I'm having such a good time.'

35:07.520 --> 35:11.640
Instead of necking on with one bird,
I'm necking on with two birds.

35:15.440 --> 35:18.800
Kyle is going to be balls deep
in some bird tonight.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.520
He hasn't lost his mojo.

35:23.240 --> 35:27.360
'I've had a mint night so I'm taking
these girls back to the shag pad.'

35:27.440 --> 35:30.000
Fuck it.
In for a penny, in for a pound.

35:30.080 --> 35:32.360
'There is thick
and then there is Kyle.'

35:32.440 --> 35:34.600
There is a player
and then there is Kyle.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.640
There's a lad
and then there is Kyle.

35:36.720 --> 35:41.120
'Taking the girls back to the villa?
That's stupidity. Know your limits.'

35:41.200 --> 35:44.840
Don't worry, the girls will be
fucking not even existent there.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.520
Hopefully.
They won't be there, definitely not.

35:47.600 --> 35:50.000
Kyle's decided to bring
the birds back home.

35:50.080 --> 35:53.600
Nae worries, mate. I can't think
what could go wrong. You tit.

36:01.640 --> 36:04.040
I feel utterly sick.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.040
Two cars, girls.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.520
Fucking hell!

36:07.600 --> 36:10.440
Fuck! This has now been taken
to a complete new level.

36:10.520 --> 36:12.360
I don't know
if I can deal with this.

36:12.440 --> 36:15.080
I don't know if the girls
in the house are asleep,

36:15.160 --> 36:18.000
so I decide to
recruit Nathan and recruit Scott

36:18.080 --> 36:20.360
to take the girls
to the shag pad for us.

36:20.440 --> 36:23.200
Kyle thinks it's a good idea,
me to walk in with them.

36:23.280 --> 36:24.520
That's gonna work.

36:24.600 --> 36:27.520
There's two girls.
There's two fucking girls!

36:27.600 --> 36:28.840
Whose girls are they?

36:28.920 --> 36:31.480
All the girls are awake.
Alert! Alert!

36:31.560 --> 36:33.920
Every single lad in the house
to the shag pad.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.400
(Marnie) All right, lads?

36:35.480 --> 36:38.000
The girls try and talk to us.
Fuck! What do I do?

36:38.080 --> 36:40.000
I'm going straight to the shag pad.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.960
We're so disappointed in Nathan.

36:42.040 --> 36:44.400
He just walked in
and completely ignored us.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.480
'What the fuck is going on there?'

36:46.560 --> 36:48.520
'Every one of those boys ignored me.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.840
No-one asked if I'm OK
after everything I've seen tonight.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.640
'It's fucking wrong.'

36:53.720 --> 36:56.320
Do they realise
they shagged someone last night?

36:56.400 --> 36:57.840
What an embarrassment!

36:57.920 --> 37:03.040
Do you mind fucking off?
The exits are here, here and here.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.680
(knocking on door)

37:04.760 --> 37:06.880
I put the "do not disturb" sign up.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.960
Why yous all crammed
in this one room?

37:09.040 --> 37:11.040
You know how sad that is?

37:11.120 --> 37:12.800
I am fucking furious.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.320
They're taking
the fucking piss out of us!

37:17.400 --> 37:20.760
They're banshee-bitch crazy
trying to knock the door down.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.160
This wasn't a good idea.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.280
(banging)

37:25.320 --> 37:26.800
(shrieks)

37:26.880 --> 37:29.520
I'm so glad
I've got the lads protecting us.

37:31.120 --> 37:34.720
(Charlotte)
Open this fucking door! Now!

37:34.800 --> 37:36.920
Fuck this.
I need to turn into a general.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.960
Take cover! Barricade the door!
Reinforcements!

37:41.080 --> 37:42.720
(mutters indistinctly)

37:42.800 --> 37:44.520
Psycho Charlotte has flipped.

37:44.600 --> 37:47.080
She is not stopping
till she gets in that room.

37:47.160 --> 37:51.240
I will get each and every one
of your fucking cases

37:51.320 --> 37:53.280
and fling it in the fucking pool!

37:53.360 --> 37:56.560
Never in all my time
have I seen the girls

37:56.640 --> 37:59.280
so desperate to get in the shag pad.

37:59.360 --> 38:02.080
Fucking stupid cunt!

38:02.160 --> 38:03.480
Charlotte is pure nuts,

38:03.560 --> 38:05.600
so the bang's out the window
for Kyle.

38:06.640 --> 38:08.760
It's not normally like this.

38:13.480 --> 38:16.760
So I decided to play the good guy
and send these two girls home.

38:16.840 --> 38:19.920
We need to get these girls out
and Kyle away from the girls

38:20.000 --> 38:21.680
before he gets battered.

38:23.040 --> 38:25.680
What the fuck is this?

38:25.760 --> 38:27.560
"Cunt. 2 faced. Sheep. Liar."

38:29.720 --> 38:32.320
You're a cunt for sleeping
with two-faced sheep.

38:32.400 --> 38:36.760
The girls might be half-right,
but I am no two-faced sheep.

38:36.840 --> 38:40.480
I'm single, what the fuck? I necked
on with two birds, simple as.

38:40.560 --> 38:43.920
So there we go. They were
your girls, you fucking coward!

38:44.000 --> 38:47.560
I'm not having this. Not a chance.
He's getting a piece of my mind.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.680
You evil fucking cow.
Leave the room.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.600
'I don't want to spend every night

38:52.680 --> 38:55.680
in this fucking house
being depressed.'

38:55.760 --> 38:59.200
I tried to work it out with her.
I tried to have a relationship.

38:59.280 --> 39:03.320
It didn't fucking work.
I need to be single and so does she.

39:03.400 --> 39:06.400
Do you not think bringing
two girls back is fucking evil?

39:06.480 --> 39:07.480
I'm single.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.560
Yes, Kyle, I know you are single,

39:09.640 --> 39:12.920
but you were doing everything
you promised you wouldn't do,

39:13.000 --> 39:14.360
and that is why I'm angry.

39:14.440 --> 39:15.720
You hate me now.

39:15.800 --> 39:19.000
Oh, I couldn't hate you
any more than I do...

39:19.080 --> 39:20.080
Goodbye.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.560
...but what you did was disgusting.

39:22.640 --> 39:25.520
Kyle has done the right thing.
He finished with Holly,

39:25.600 --> 39:29.120
then he pulled while he was single.
What's the problem with that?

39:29.200 --> 39:32.640
So, Holly's upset because
Kyle pulled a bird. Fuck off!

39:33.360 --> 39:35.160
The boys used to be my brothers.

39:35.240 --> 39:38.160
Now I see they didn't really
give a shit about me at all.

39:38.240 --> 39:41.440
I'm going to the girls' room
because what I did was wrong.

39:41.520 --> 39:43.400
Hopefully they'll hear us out.

39:43.480 --> 39:47.280
We are meant to be a family
and we are getting torn apart.

39:47.360 --> 39:48.640
(indistinct)

39:48.720 --> 39:51.920
We don't sit on the sidelines
and watch people get hurt.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.320
Charlotte just
shut that shit right down.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.080
She won't let us get a word in.

39:56.160 --> 39:59.520
Have you ever even said to Kyle
at one point, "Don't do this"?

39:59.600 --> 40:03.560
Me and the girls are angry at the
lads for encouraging his behaviour.

40:03.640 --> 40:05.640
We're meant to be a family.

40:05.720 --> 40:09.960
Everyone's lying. Everyone's
being two-faced, and it's awful.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.320
This isn't the house
that I once lived in.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.320
Charlotte is fucking fuming.

40:14.400 --> 40:17.680
There's no way this will get sorted
tonight. I'm going to bed.

40:19.920 --> 40:23.160
I'm thinking about
everything that's happened tonight.

40:23.240 --> 40:26.560
I just never thought things
could possibly go this wrong.

40:26.640 --> 40:27.680
I'm devastated.

40:27.760 --> 40:31.560
I don't want to speak to them
tomorrow. They're all so two-faced.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.680
Look at you,
you've not shed one tear.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.800
I haven't seen
the water of your eye.

40:35.880 --> 40:39.880
No, I haven't, because
the person who I love is dead to me.

40:39.960 --> 40:44.520
He doesn't exist anymore. Now...
I've got the closure that I need.

40:44.600 --> 40:48.280
'My eyes have been opened and I can
see Kyle for who he truly is.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.800
'I was blinded by Kyle
and blinded by love.'

40:50.880 --> 40:52.400
It won't be happening again.

40:52.480 --> 40:55.760
Let's now go and sleep together.
Yeah. Not in that way.

40:56.800 --> 40:59.720
'I'm so glad I'm going back to bed
with the old Holly.'

40:59.800 --> 41:03.240
I think she's finally back,
but that's not the only thing.

41:03.320 --> 41:06.720
'The boy/girl divide
is bigger than ever.'

41:06.800 --> 41:10.360
Tomorrow's gonna be fun. Yay.

41:10.560 --> 41:10.760
.
