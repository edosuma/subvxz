- 'Oh, no.'

18:43.622 --> 18:45.541
{\an1}Maybe my [beep] fat
got a little smaller.

{\an1}- Another blow dryer?
- 'No, another blow dryer.'

I changed their voltage.

No, I feel like, no.

he's gonna try to woo you.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.395
He's not gonna do it.

23:20.398 --> 23:22.776

Good morning, Vincent's beard.

24:00.438 --> 24:03.483
{\an1}Did you both sleep well?
Let's have a meeting.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.902
{\an1}- I'm starving.
- I need to eat, bro.

24:05.986 --> 24:08.655
{\an1}- Like, I have to eat.
- What's our street again?

24:08.738 --> 24:11.032
{\an1}- Viasta or something.
- Well, they're all via.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.160
{\an4}<i>(Mike)</i>
<i>We don't even know</i>

{\an1}We don't even know how to ask
questions about directions.

24:17.372 --> 24:20.292
We should probably go to the
closest, the closest place.

24:20.375 --> 24:22.377
We better figure that stuff
out before we go any further

24:22.460 --> 24:25.255
{\an1}'cause, uh, we're having
problems with our map.

24:25.338 --> 24:27.048
{\an1}- Yo, this guy's gonna die.
- Let's go.

'Let's just wing it,
I'm done starving.'

24:29.968 --> 24:31.011
{\an8}- I can.
- I can!

24:31.094 --> 24:32.637
{\an1}- You're driving, let's go.
- Whoo!

24:32.721 --> 24:35.974
- I'm driving!
- Oh, my God, so...

24:36.057 --> 24:39.603
{\an1}We have to base our whole time
here on Nicole and you?

24:39.686 --> 24:40.478
- Yes.
- I could teach you.

24:40.562 --> 24:43.064
{\an1}Finally,
I'm useful for something

24:43.148 --> 24:45.609
{\an1}because I'm not useful
for anything in this house.

24:45.692 --> 24:46.443
But I can drive stick.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.570
- Oh, my God.
- But in Italy?

24:48.653 --> 24:50.238
- Listen.
- Really?

24:50.322 --> 24:51.615
{\an1}We got navigation,
so wherever we gotta go

24:51.698 --> 24:52.157
{\an1}just write down
the address, that's it.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.117
I'm useful.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.411
{\an1}Only one girl can drive
and that's Nicole.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.413
We can only fit
four people per car.

24:58.496 --> 25:00.457

to Nicole driving our car.

- That one's yours.

- Oh, this [beep]'s dope.

25:06.087 --> 25:07.505
{\an1}- Three in the front.
- Wait, tell him not to go yet.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.674
{\an1}- I need to move this forward.
- We got it.

{\an5}(Mike)
'Should I give this
to the girls?'

25:11.343 --> 25:14.054
They can follow us.

{\an4}<i>(Vinny)</i>

I need to scoot it up.

25:23.521 --> 25:25.941
- That's it.
- Whoa!

'Oh, my God.'

Oh, my God, moving forward.

- Is the car on?
- They just left.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.241
{\an4}(Vinny)
'Wait, wait for the girls.
Wait for the girls.'

25:34.324 --> 25:35.617
Bro, we'll never get there.

run over anybody?
