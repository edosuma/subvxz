00:53.428 --> 00:55.305
{\an8}Macie, behold...

00:55.388 --> 00:59.184
{\an5}High school.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.310
{\an8}Come on, Dodie.

01:00.393 --> 01:01.936
{\an7}It's not that different
than junior high.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.813
{\an8}That's where you're wrong,
Ginger.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.524
{\an8}What you're looking at

01:06.608 --> 01:10.069
{\an8}is the very essence
of the teenage experience.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.613
{\an8}Oh, great.

01:11.696 --> 01:14.657
{\an8}(<i> breathing deeply</i> )

01:14.741 --> 01:15.658
{\an8}DODIE:
Easy, Macie.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.160
{\an8}You'll melt your sandwich.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.077
{\an8}I'm okay.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.245
{\an8}(<i> breathing deeply</i> )

01:19.329 --> 01:21.206
{\an8}There's nothing
to worry about.

01:21.289 --> 01:22.832
{\an8}It's just a high school
French class.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.835
Yeah, with
rascally teenagers

01:25.919 --> 01:29.672
{\an1}who have a lot more than
conjugation on their minds.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.342
Maybe I should take
wood shop instead.

01:32.425 --> 01:33.843
It's not like you'll be
with total strangers.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.095
Courtney will be
there, too.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.431
News flash, Ginger.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.767
Courtney Gripling and I
are hardly peas in a pod.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.603
Courtney:
<i>Bonjour, mon ami.</i>

01:46.231 --> 01:49.484
Ready for "le big day,"
Brigitte?

01:49.567 --> 01:51.194
Case in point.

01:51.277 --> 01:51.528
Uh, it's Macie.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.488
I know, silly.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.657
{\an1}That's my French name
for you.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.826
{\an1}I'm thinking
of going by...

01:57.909 --> 01:59.494
Katrina.

01:59.577 --> 02:01.704
Eww... why are there
carrot sticks on the ground?

02:01.788 --> 02:03.998
Macie's a
little nervous.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.043
{\an1}Why ever would you be
nervous about high school?

02:07.126 --> 02:08.877
{\an1}GIRL:
Oh, look, Chantel...

02:08.961 --> 02:09.586
little lost preteens.

02:09.670 --> 02:10.880
Aren't they cute?

02:10.964 --> 02:13.967
You better run along,
wee ones.

02:14.050 --> 02:16.261
The kiddy school's
over there.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.720
Who retired

02:17.804 --> 02:20.890
and made you
crossing guards?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.058
(<i> others gasp</i> )

02:22.141 --> 02:23.101
Excuse me?

02:23.184 --> 02:26.479
We happen to be
advanced preteens

02:26.563 --> 02:29.023
{\an1}on our way to high school
French class.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.692
{\an1}Isn't that true,
Brigitte?

02:30.775 --> 02:31.901
Um, um...<i> oui?</i>

02:31.985 --> 02:33.236
See, we're gifted.

02:33.319 --> 02:36.239
{\an1}Well, I guess we'll be
seeing you later.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.824
Looking forward to it.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.450
Love your shoes.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.787
Wow, thanks.
That was amazing.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.247
Standing your ground

02:44.330 --> 02:46.958
{\an1}is everything
in high school, Ginger.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.209
(<i> bell rings</i> )

02:48.293 --> 02:49.335
There's the bell.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.420
{\an1}<i>Allons-y, Brigitte,</i>
<i>tout de suite.</i>

02:50.503 --> 02:52.505
Bye, Mace.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.883
Take notes... or
photos if you can.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.175
(<i> sighs</i> )

02:56.259 --> 02:58.636
Somehow, it's as if
those high school doors

02:58.720 --> 03:01.180
{\an1}are opening for us,
too, Ginger.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.601
You really shouldn't
have done that

03:04.684 --> 03:06.060
to the bus driver, Carl.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.270
This is a long walk.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.855
That woman has no business

03:08.938 --> 03:11.190
{\an1}being behind the wheel
in the first place.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.694
Hold the phone!

03:14.777 --> 03:16.404
Hoods, check this out.

03:16.487 --> 03:18.531
"Larry's Mail Order
Oddities."

03:18.615 --> 03:21.326
Wow, maybe this is
where our bus driver

03:21.409 --> 03:23.161
got her removable
glass eye.

03:23.244 --> 03:27.373
{\an1}See, one good treasure can
make all the pain worthwhile.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.084
{\an1}Come on, can't be late
or else Gordo will freak.

03:30.168 --> 03:30.960
I'm right behind you.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.796
One screaming lady a day
is enough.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.674
Besides my mom, I mean.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.887
Ooh, looking good.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.973
<i>Bonjour...</i> Hello...

03:44.057 --> 03:45.391
COURTNEY:
No way!

03:45.475 --> 03:47.977
I have that same skirt
but in a different color. Jinx!

03:48.061 --> 03:50.396
{\an5}<i>Excusez-moi, mademoiselles.</i>

03:50.480 --> 03:52.815
Excuse us.

03:52.899 --> 03:57.570
Looks like Will Patterson
knows his French.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.408
Do I know you?

04:02.492 --> 04:03.618
Indirectly.

04:03.701 --> 04:06.704
I hang with Ginger
and your brother Darren.

04:06.788 --> 04:07.580
We're kind of a posse.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.041
Darren has a posse?

04:10.124 --> 04:12.168
I've been at your house.

04:12.251 --> 04:13.002
You lock your room.

04:13.086 --> 04:17.214
Oh, and, uh,
this is Katrina Gripling.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.423
{\an1}(<i> laughs</i> )

04:18.507 --> 04:18.800
Funny Macie.

04:18.882 --> 04:20.593
It's Courtney.

04:20.677 --> 04:21.803
<i>Enchanté.</i>

04:21.886 --> 04:23.179
(<i> giggles</i> )

04:23.262 --> 04:25.473
<i>Bonjour!</i>

04:25.556 --> 04:28.351
CLASS:
<i>Bonjour, Madame Berger.</i>

04:28.434 --> 04:29.560
<i>Très bien.</i>

04:29.644 --> 04:31.020
I would like to present
Mademoiselles

04:31.104 --> 04:34.691
Courtney Gripling
and Macie Lightfoot

04:34.774 --> 04:38.111
who because of their advanced
aptitude for languages

04:38.194 --> 04:40.905
will be joining us
for the remainder of the term.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.657
(<i> applause</i> )

04:42.740 --> 04:43.866
Excellent.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.829
Now, Courtney, why don't you
tell us a little about yourself?

04:47.912 --> 04:50.289
Well, ever since
I was oh, so young

04:50.373 --> 04:53.543
Mama and I jetted to <i> Paris</i>
for the spring collection.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.545
<i>Haute couture!</i>

04:55.628 --> 04:56.838
<i>Fantastique.</i>

04:56.921 --> 04:59.048
Macie,<i> s'il vous plait.</i>

04:59.132 --> 05:01.050
I've never been to France,
per se

05:01.134 --> 05:05.304
but I hear their cheese
is quite good.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.640
And, uh, I have a pool.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.225
<i>Une piscine?</i>

05:09.308 --> 05:11.686
<i>Oui.</i>

05:11.769 --> 05:12.395
You may sit.

05:14.313 --> 05:15.523
Dudes, check it out.

05:15.606 --> 05:16.774
<i>Piscines</i> are cool.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.319
Gordon:
Now, as you all know

05:20.403 --> 05:23.823
it's time again for
the spring term science fair.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.617
This year's topic will be

05:26.701 --> 05:28.828
"What Makes a Genius?"

05:28.911 --> 05:30.580
Excuse me,
Mrs. Gordon

05:30.663 --> 05:32.415
but can a monkey be a genius?

05:32.498 --> 05:34.083
Because my brother's monkey

05:34.167 --> 05:36.335
knows how to work
our toaster oven.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.130
{\an1}Really? Can he make
an English muffin pizza

05:39.213 --> 05:41.007
without burning the cheese?

05:41.090 --> 05:41.841
No.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.092
Then he's no genius.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.260
{\an1}Now, if you are
constructing dioramas

05:44.343 --> 05:47.472
{\an1}they should be no bigger
than a shoebox...

05:47.555 --> 05:49.057
Hoods, look at this.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.602
You can buy a microscope slide
of Albert Einstein's actual DNA.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.854
(<i> whistles</i> )

05:54.937 --> 05:58.566
{\an5}$37!
That's some
serious cake.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.485
Hey, genius
doesn't come cheap.

06:00.568 --> 06:01.527
{\an1}Is there something
you boys

06:01.611 --> 06:04.030
would like to share
with the rest of the class?

06:04.113 --> 06:06.449
No particularly, Gordo.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.326
Just discussing our project.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.411
{\an1}We do apologize
for the interruption.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.581
(<i> clears throat</i> )

06:13.664 --> 06:15.666
Mrs. Berger,
may I have a word?

06:15.750 --> 06:17.001
{\an1}Certainly.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.586
Class, please study
your verbs quietly.

06:21.839 --> 06:24.926
{\an1}You know some of my favorite
people in the world have pools.

06:25.009 --> 06:27.345
{\an1}(<i> chuckles</i> )
Well, what a coincidence.

06:27.428 --> 06:30.598
{\an1}I have a pool, mm-hmm, only it
won't be open for another month.

06:30.681 --> 06:33.142
{\an5}We're awaiting a shipment
of French mineral water
to fill it with.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.978
Either that snack cake
I just ate was bad

06:36.062 --> 06:38.564
or she's making me sick.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.482
{\an1}Snack cakes
never go bad.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.776
{\an1}So, you ever think
about throwing a pool party?

06:41.859 --> 06:42.735
Who me?

06:42.819 --> 06:45.446
Oh, gosh, no.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.949
My parents are almost
always out of town.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.700
There'd be
no supervision.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.285
A pool with no 'rents?

06:52.120 --> 06:54.080
{\an1}Hold on a minute,
cowboy.

06:54.163 --> 06:55.748
What an excellent idea.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.500
Everyone, pool party
at Macie's.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.002
(<i> class cheers</i> )

07:00.086 --> 07:01.629
Ooh...

07:01.712 --> 07:03.881
(<i> wheezing</i> )

07:03.965 --> 07:05.883
But I'm hungry,
Carl.

07:05.967 --> 07:09.178
{\an5}My stomach
is gurgling
and everything.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.013
Hoods, for the last time...

07:11.097 --> 07:12.515
We need every penny we can get.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.520
(<i> stomach gurgles</i> )

07:17.603 --> 07:19.313
{\an1}Wait here while I go see
if Terrence

07:19.397 --> 07:21.858
{\an1}wants to rent the pickled frog
for the weekend.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.651
Oh, well, ask him
if he's going to

07:23.734 --> 07:25.653
eat his tapioca
while you're at it.

07:25.736 --> 07:27.446
(<i> stomach gurgling</i> )

07:32.869 --> 07:35.204
Not eating?

07:35.288 --> 07:38.249
Don't tell me this is
your science project.

07:38.332 --> 07:41.210
Hoodsey Bishop-- skinny genius.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.463
{\an1}For your information,
Blake Gripling

07:44.547 --> 07:47.341
{\an1}I'm not eating so that
Carl and I can buy

07:47.425 --> 07:48.217
{\an1}the last
of Einstein's DNA

07:48.301 --> 07:51.345
{\an1}from Larry's
Mail Order Oddities.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.264
{\an1}You think
you're so smart.

07:57.894 --> 07:58.936
Oh!

07:59.020 --> 08:01.564
(<i> panting</i> )

08:01.647 --> 08:04.859
Oh, sweet mother of mercy!

08:04.942 --> 08:07.653
(<i> wheezing</i> )

08:07.737 --> 08:09.322
(<i> door opens</i> )

08:09.405 --> 08:11.115
{\an4}ANDREA:
Did you see her practically
drooling over Will?

08:11.199 --> 08:14.827
{\an1}Who does she think
she is?

08:14.911 --> 08:17.330
{\an5}CHANTEL:
She even triple-flicked
her hair. Nerve.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.372
{\an1}That
Courtney Gripling

08:18.456 --> 08:19.957
{\an1}had better not use
the pool party

08:20.041 --> 08:21.375
{\an1}to get her hooks
into Will.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.752
{\an1}I wouldn't put it past
the little stuffer.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.921
Stuffer?

08:25.004 --> 08:26.005
Oh, for certain.

08:26.088 --> 08:30.009
Hmm... well, this pool party
could be fun after all.

08:30.092 --> 08:32.094
Why don't we de-bikini Gripling

08:32.178 --> 08:35.890
and show everyone at the party
just what she's made of?

08:35.972 --> 08:38.808
{\an1}Or more to the point...
not made of.

08:38.893 --> 08:39.769
(<i> both laugh</i> )

08:39.852 --> 08:40.269
Whoa...

08:40.352 --> 08:43.731
(<i> toilet flushes</i> )

08:43.813 --> 08:47.735
Is it me or are
high school toilets slipperier?

08:47.818 --> 08:48.945
Listen, young one

08:49.028 --> 08:51.739
you'd be wise to forget
what you've just heard.

08:51.822 --> 08:55.451
Because if one word of this gets
back to Gripling or anyone else

08:55.534 --> 08:58.704
we promise to make the rest
of your public school education

08:58.788 --> 08:59.622
a living nightmare.

08:59.705 --> 09:00.998
{\an3}Oh...

09:01.082 --> 09:02.833
Can't wait
for your party.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.169
See ya.

09:06.337 --> 09:10.633
To think I could have been
making lazy susans in wood shop.

09:13.594 --> 09:14.845
Courtney:
Macie is quite

09:14.929 --> 09:16.889
the upwardly mobile
high school socialite.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.849
One minute she's
parlez-vousing français

09:18.933 --> 09:21.310
the next she's inviting
our entire French class

09:21.394 --> 09:22.812
to her pool this weekend.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.355
Oh, did you hear that?

09:24.438 --> 09:26.691
{\an1}Do you think
she'll invite us?

09:26.774 --> 09:28.901
Don't be silly, Dodie,
she has to.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.112
Isn't she?

09:31.195 --> 09:33.990
(<i> wheezing</i> )

09:34.073 --> 09:35.491
<i>Au revoir, Macie.</i>

09:35.574 --> 09:36.659
Yeah, yeah.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.494
Blast that French.

09:38.577 --> 09:41.163
Macie, we just heard
about your pool party.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.498
{\an3}Oh...

09:42.581 --> 09:44.208
The word already hit the street?

09:44.292 --> 09:46.877
Hey, you got a
diving board, right?

09:46.961 --> 09:48.337
Uh, yeah.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.505
All right!

09:49.588 --> 09:50.673
Water rumble!

09:50.756 --> 09:52.091
{\an3}Rock on!

09:52.174 --> 09:55.594
Gee, Macie, you sure made
a lot of new friends fast.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.054
I've got Courtney
to thank for that.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.557
She did it all for me...

09:59.640 --> 10:01.183
without asking me first.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.644
She was probably just
trying to help you fit in.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.146
You do realize that
this is the kind of event

10:05.229 --> 10:07.690
that can make or break a girl?

10:07.773 --> 10:11.402
Well, my money's on broken.

10:11.485 --> 10:14.572
{\an1}$37 with 24 cents
to spare.

10:14.655 --> 10:17.700
{\an1}Hoodsey,
we're in business!

10:17.783 --> 10:21.203
{\an5}Good! Now how about
that chicken pot pie
you promised?

10:21.287 --> 10:22.705
I'm a man of my word.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.541
{\an3}Hey...

10:25.625 --> 10:27.585
Can I have some
of this cottage cheese too?

10:27.668 --> 10:29.879
It's expired, go ahead.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.797
Good afternoon,
Carl Foutley here.

10:31.881 --> 10:35.343
First, let me say how impressed
I am with your catalog.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.303
Now, on to business.

10:37.386 --> 10:41.015
I'm most interested
in item number 8147:

10:41.098 --> 10:43.267
the Einstein DNA sample.

10:44.268 --> 10:47.021
What do you mean you ran out
three minutes ago?

10:47.104 --> 10:49.815
What kind of low-rent shop
runs out of Einstein DNA?

10:49.899 --> 10:53.736
No, I do not want
the Nixon DNA instead.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.280
You know,
the cottage cheese isn't bad

10:56.364 --> 10:58.324
if you eat
around the crusty part.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.117
{\an1}Hoods, can
the cheese crust!

11:00.201 --> 11:01.577
This is an emergency.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.412
We have three days
to come up with

11:03.496 --> 11:06.123
a "What Make a Genius" project
that blows Gordo away

11:06.207 --> 11:07.875
or else it's summer school
for us!

11:07.958 --> 11:10.836
What? We can't go
to summer school, Carl!

11:10.920 --> 11:11.587
I'll sweat up a storm.

11:11.670 --> 11:14.757
We'll have to ring out
my jersey.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.133
Hoods... that's it!

11:16.217 --> 11:18.094
We'll collect
bio samples

11:18.177 --> 11:19.845
from everyone
we meet

11:19.929 --> 11:22.598
and compare their
DNA to Einstein's

11:22.681 --> 11:24.058
to determine
their geniosity.

11:24.141 --> 11:30.022
But Carl, we'll need a lab, and
the FBI and all sorts of stuff.

11:30.106 --> 11:34.276
{\an5}Hoods, this is fourth
grade science fair
we're talking about.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.653
We'll wing it.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.490
Is geniosity a word?

11:40.741 --> 11:43.035
Okay, the lifeguard service
will send someone over.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.162
What's next?

11:45.246 --> 11:45.955
{\an5}Just...

11:45.246 --> 11:45.955
(<i> knock on door</i> )

11:46.038 --> 11:48.541
Hello, ladies, we're
here for your DNA.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.501
Assume the position
of compliance.

11:50.584 --> 11:54.004
Your choice: will it be
fingernails or saliva?

11:54.088 --> 11:55.714
Carl, out!

11:55.798 --> 11:57.800
{\an1}Maybe we can have
your hairbrush.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.803
We are trying to
plan a pool party.

12:00.886 --> 12:01.345
Pool party?

12:01.429 --> 12:03.722
Not just
any pool party.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.766
All the extremely
influential

12:05.850 --> 12:07.184
high school teens
will be there.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.353
(<i> sighs nasally</i> )

12:09.437 --> 12:10.729
Very well, carry on.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.857
Thank you for your cooperation.

12:12.940 --> 12:15.484
{\an5}Hoodsey:
Carl, they <i> didn't</i>
cooperate.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.279
Next, we need to get
over to Macie's right away.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.156
{\an1}To check
the pool's pH level?

12:20.239 --> 12:22.324
No, to set up
the make-out room.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.951
Have you lost your mind?!

12:24.034 --> 12:29.540
This is a pool party,
not some hippy-dippy love-in!

12:29.623 --> 12:31.542
All right, Macie, what's up?

12:31.625 --> 12:34.795
You're acting
way more uptight than usual.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.589
Oh... Ginger, Dodie

12:36.672 --> 12:40.718
upon my frail shoulders
I bear a horrible secret

12:40.801 --> 12:43.721
and if I utter
just one word of it

12:43.804 --> 12:48.225
my entire public school future
will be destroyed.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.853
{\an1}And they may just
take you down with me, too.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.313
Who's they?

12:52.396 --> 12:55.733
Chantel and Andrea, the wicked
high school girls who...

12:55.816 --> 12:57.151
Chantel and Andrea?

12:57.234 --> 12:58.652
What did they do
to you?

12:58.736 --> 13:00.905
{\an1}Come on, Lightfoot,
out with it.

13:00.988 --> 13:01.739
No, I can't... I can't say...

13:01.822 --> 13:06.285
Well, if you can't <i> say.</i>
then <i> show.</i>

13:06.368 --> 13:07.745
{\an1}Okay.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.288
Ginger:
Five words.

13:09.371 --> 13:12.416
Fourth and
fifth words...

13:15.586 --> 13:17.880
Courtney Gripling!

13:17.963 --> 13:21.300
{\an5}Courtney:
I swore after
this past summer of growth

13:21.383 --> 13:23.302
that I'd never do this again.

13:23.385 --> 13:25.095
You can just wear
another suit.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.473
{\an1}But this suit came
from the Paris shows.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.807
It's totally apropos.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.268
What happens when you
get in the pool?

13:32.645 --> 13:34.813
I don't suppose
they make waterproof tissue.

13:34.897 --> 13:37.733
Courtney! You'll never guess
what I got!

13:37.816 --> 13:40.402
{\an5}Don't know, don't care,
don't slam the door
on your way our.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.904
Curses!

13:41.987 --> 13:43.656
No matter,
I'm quite certain

13:43.739 --> 13:47.952
Winston will appreciate
my cunning.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.995
Oh, Winston!

13:52.706 --> 13:55.084
(<i> pops bubble wrap</i> )

13:55.167 --> 13:56.627
Miranda!

13:56.710 --> 13:59.421
Look what I found.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.340
Both:
De-bikini-ing?!

14:01.423 --> 14:03.259
{\an5}High school's
way rougher
than I thought.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.636
You're telling me.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.096
(<i> snorting sigh</i> )

14:07.179 --> 14:09.932
You guys, Courtney may
not be our best friend

14:10.015 --> 14:12.893
but we can't let her
be humiliated like this.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.770
Oh, yes, we can, Ginger.

14:14.853 --> 14:17.731
{\an1}This is my future
we're talking about.

14:17.815 --> 14:20.401
I got to side
with Macie on this.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.194
If we let those high school kids
push us around now

14:22.278 --> 14:26.240
who know what will happen next
year, or the year after that?

14:26.323 --> 14:29.243
{\an1}But we cannot take
on high school teens.

14:29.326 --> 14:32.037
Especially girls
with side ponytails.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.122
I'll cancel the party.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.749
Not an option.

14:35.833 --> 14:36.834
She's right.

14:36.917 --> 14:37.418
Andrea and Chantel
would know

14:37.501 --> 14:39.336
why you canceled.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.129
You have to have the party.

14:40.212 --> 14:43.465
{\an1}But what about Courtney's
bikini top?

14:43.549 --> 14:46.010
Courtney can't lose
her bikini top

14:46.093 --> 14:48.345
if it's attached
to the bottom.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.431
(<i> phone rings</i> )

14:50.514 --> 14:53.726
Courtney Gripling's room,
Miranda speaking.

14:53.809 --> 14:56.312
Eww... it's Foutley.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.646
Hello, Ginger.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.731
Hi, Courtney.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.233
{\an1}Hope I'm not catching you
at a bad time.

15:01.317 --> 15:05.154
{\an5}Oh, no, I'm modeling
my new bathing suit
for Miranda.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.448
Oh...

15:07.531 --> 15:09.575
{\an1}That's kind of why
I was calling.

15:09.658 --> 15:12.244
{\an1}Um, what kind of suit are
you wearing to the big bash?

15:12.328 --> 15:14.330
How cute...

15:14.413 --> 15:15.998
Ginger's fishing
for fashion tips.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.583
{\an1}Aw...

15:17.666 --> 15:20.336
Well, Ginger,
as you may not know

15:20.419 --> 15:24.006
this upcoming season is all
about bikinis and Buddha beads.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.507
{\an1}Really?

15:25.591 --> 15:27.343
{\an1}Uh, I heard
one-pieces were in.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.135
{\an5}(<i> Courtney laughing</i> )

15:28.218 --> 15:30.346
{\an5}Courtney:
I bet Dodie told you that.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.848
{\an5}Take it from me:
the Buddha beads may be optional

15:32.931 --> 15:35.351
{\an5}but you'll definitely
want to wear a bikini.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.019
{\an5}I wouldn't be seen
without one.

15:37.102 --> 15:37.394
Want to bet?

15:37.478 --> 15:39.355
{\an5}What's that?

15:39.438 --> 15:41.190
{\an1}Nothing.
Uh, see you tomorrow.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.609
All:
Oh...!

15:43.692 --> 15:45.194
We need a new plan.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.029
All we have to do
is keep Courtney

15:47.112 --> 15:48.572
{\an1}away from
Andrea and Chantel.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.491
{\an1}Kind of like
when those bullies

15:50.574 --> 15:52.743
{\an1}used to play keep-away
with your lunch box.

15:52.826 --> 15:55.204
Oh, what I'd give
for the good old days.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.919
Dwayne sure has
a lot of ear wax.

16:02.002 --> 16:05.673
{\an5}If that's not
a sign of genius,
I don't know what is.

16:05.756 --> 16:08.384
That's nothing compared
to what we'll score today.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.968
Try this bathing suit on.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.721
But Carl, I like
my super-hero swim trunks.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.598
They give me extra confidence

16:14.682 --> 16:16.725
and my mom says
they're slimming.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.353
{\an1}Yeah, well, they don't have
enough pockets.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.065
Hmm, not bad.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.612
{\an1}We regret
to inform you

16:28.696 --> 16:32.157
{\an4}that the Lightfoots'
no gum policy is
strictly enforced.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.743
{\an1}I ask that you dispose
of all chewing gum

16:34.827 --> 16:37.121
{\an1}with my associate,
Hoods P. Bishop.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.748
One wad per receptacle, please.

16:39.832 --> 16:43.043
(<i> hip hop playing...)</i>

16:49.758 --> 16:51.593
Hello, Macie.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.512
Oh...<i> bonjour.</i>

16:53.595 --> 16:54.471
Cut the French.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.514
Where's Courtney?

16:55.597 --> 16:57.266
Not here yet.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.016
You haven't told her

16:58.100 --> 17:00.686
{\an1}about our little secret,
have you?

17:00.769 --> 17:02.146
Apricot jerky?

17:07.483 --> 17:09.778
(<i> grunting...</i> )

17:10.820 --> 17:12.156
Am I glad to see you.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.156
I'm sworn
to secrecy

17:13.240 --> 17:14.366
so I can't
tell you why

17:14.450 --> 17:14.907
but we need
your help

17:14.992 --> 17:16.827
in running
interference

17:16.910 --> 17:19.121
{\an5}between the
high school girls
and Courtney.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.079
No prob.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.415
I have an older brother.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.083
My whole life's
about interference.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.627
{\an5}Well, if it isn't
my little brother
Metal Head.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.422
Greeting... Wilbert.

17:28.505 --> 17:31.592
Ooh, I told you
never to call me that!

17:31.675 --> 17:33.552
You're going in.

17:33.635 --> 17:35.345
Will, no! I'll rust!

17:35.429 --> 17:38.098
Wait... aah!

17:38.182 --> 17:39.433
(<i> splash</i> )

17:39.516 --> 17:41.560
{\an5}Will:
I told you.
(<i> laughs</i> )

17:45.230 --> 17:46.690
Are you all right?

17:46.774 --> 17:48.233
I lost my hat.

17:48.317 --> 17:48.692
I'll get it.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.610
Bonjour,<i> mes amis.</i>

17:49.693 --> 17:51.361
{\an1}I haven't
kept you waiting...

17:51.445 --> 17:53.489
have I, Will?

17:54.573 --> 17:55.115
(<i> all gasp</i> )

17:55.199 --> 17:57.826
Shame on you, Gregor Smith.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.121
Your mother teaches
Sunday school.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.748
Oh...

18:10.422 --> 18:12.257
(<i> gasps</i> )

18:15.093 --> 18:16.136
You look really great.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.638
(<i> laughs</i> )

18:17.721 --> 18:20.599
Thanks. Polka dots are
all the rage in <i> Paris.</i>

18:20.682 --> 18:21.850
Hi, Courtney.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.018
Ginger!

18:23.101 --> 18:25.521
Your bathing suit
is so... vintage.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.815
{\an5}We've been looking
all over for you,
Courtney.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.859
We thought
you'd never get here.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.528
(<i> laughs</i> ) You act
like I'm the life of the party.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.197
Oh, but you are.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.699
What do you think
about a game of chicken?

18:37.783 --> 18:40.661
I guess... so long as I
can have Will as my partner.

18:40.744 --> 18:41.829
{\an3}Sure.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.205
(<i> giggles</i> )

18:43.288 --> 18:44.706
(<i> both sigh in disgust</i> )

18:44.790 --> 18:46.834
{\an1}Courtney, I really need
to talk to you

18:46.917 --> 18:48.210
right away,
in private.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.420
Okay, Ginger,
don't have a kitten.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.548
This is her first
real high school pool party.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.716
What gives, Ginger?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.844
You're acting
really freaky.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.930
Um, uh... Courtney,
I have something to tell you.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.057
Macie heard Chantel and Andrea
talking about you.

19:02.140 --> 19:05.394
Ginger, you're starting
to sound like Miranda.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.646
There is no reason
for you to be jealous

19:07.729 --> 19:09.314
of my new high school friends.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.607
But Courtney...

19:10.691 --> 19:13.235
You'll always be
my junior high friend.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.445
Now, let's play chicken!

19:15.529 --> 19:16.780
{\an3}Whoo!

19:17.990 --> 19:19.032
Bad news:
we're out of soy dogs.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.994
Worse news: I tried
to tell Courtney

19:22.077 --> 19:22.578
but she wouldn't
listen.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.663
Now what?

19:24.746 --> 19:26.582
If that bikini top
goes flying...

19:26.665 --> 19:28.876
We'll be there to catch it.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.503
Oh... oh...

19:31.587 --> 19:33.505
Now listen up.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.300
By the power vested in me
by the lifeguards' union

19:36.383 --> 19:38.719
I must inform you that unfair
play will not be tolerated

19:38.802 --> 19:40.554
and is punishable by ejection.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.598
Now play chicken!

19:42.681 --> 19:43.807
(<i> blows whistle</i> )

19:43.891 --> 19:45.767
(<i> kids cheering</i> )

19:45.851 --> 19:47.728
(<i> giggling</i> )

19:47.811 --> 19:51.398
Whoa... whoa... whoa!

19:54.359 --> 19:55.235
(<i> laughing</i> )

19:56.528 --> 19:58.405
Whoa...

20:01.909 --> 20:03.619
You're so slippery.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.163
Oh...

20:09.374 --> 20:11.335
Macie... code red.

20:13.253 --> 20:17.716
I see a strap that's just
waiting to be snapped...

20:20.052 --> 20:20.469
(<i> screams</i> )

20:20.552 --> 20:22.221
Whoa... whoa...

20:25.641 --> 20:26.808
I knew it!

20:26.892 --> 20:28.977
(<i> Ginger grunts</i> )

20:29.061 --> 20:31.104
Dodie... uh...

20:32.814 --> 20:33.941
(<i> blows whistle</i> )

20:34.024 --> 20:34.900
That's a violation!

20:34.983 --> 20:37.110
Everyone out of the pool!

20:37.194 --> 20:38.111
Party's over.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.571
Kids:
Oh...

20:39.655 --> 20:40.405
Come on, come on...

20:40.489 --> 20:43.325
dog-paddle your way
over here, come on.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.577
Way to go, losers.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.370
(<i> both gasp</i> )

20:50.207 --> 20:52.834
Nice inner tube.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.211
Preteen.

20:55.545 --> 20:57.214
Sorry about all this, Courtney.

20:57.297 --> 21:00.092
(<i> sniffling</i> ):
It's not your fault, Brigitte.

21:00.175 --> 21:03.512
Ginger tried to tell me
and you saved me

21:03.595 --> 21:06.348
with this really disgusting
childhood relic.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.642
I guess I know
who my real friends are.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.437
(<i> sniffles</i> )

21:12.521 --> 21:15.399
She called us
her real friends.

21:15.482 --> 21:19.403
I don't know if I can handle
that kind of responsibility.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.534
{\an5}Gordon:
So let me see if I
understand you correctly.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.245
{\an1}You believe
this man's earwax

21:28.328 --> 21:32.207
{\an1}contains DNA
resembling that of Einstein

21:32.290 --> 21:35.377
which proves him
to be a genius?

21:35.460 --> 21:38.088
That is our
hypothesis, yes.

21:38.171 --> 21:39.840
Nice try, Foutley

21:39.923 --> 21:42.634
{\an1}but I fear
such mediocre efforts

21:42.718 --> 21:44.636
pale by comparison.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.222
{\an1}Mrs. Gordon, may I call
your attention

21:47.305 --> 21:51.059
{\an1}to my presentation of
authentic Albert Einstein DNA?

21:51.143 --> 21:53.729
You snake! I should have
known it was you

21:53.812 --> 21:54.563
who bought my brilliant idea.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.440
Bought?!

21:56.523 --> 21:57.941
So sorry, Foutley.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.068
He who snoozes...

22:00.152 --> 22:00.986
Loses.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.863
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to

22:02.946 --> 22:03.905
disqualify your
entry, Blake.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.115
Science is a study.

22:05.198 --> 22:08.035
One which must be
experienced and proven.

22:08.118 --> 22:11.538
Not purchased
from some dime store.

22:11.621 --> 22:12.706
{\an1}But, but it was
a catalog!

22:12.789 --> 22:14.833
Hoodsey, Carl...

22:14.916 --> 22:16.793
While I shudder to think

22:16.877 --> 22:20.088
of how you came upon
these... bodily samples

22:20.172 --> 22:23.175
and question the validity
of your claim

22:23.258 --> 22:23.925
{\an1}I commend
your efforts.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.429
{\an1}It looks like I won't be
seeing you

22:27.512 --> 22:29.431
{\an1}in summer school
after all.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.683
Oh, salvation!

22:31.767 --> 22:35.812
Gordo, perhaps it is you
who is the genius.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.356
{\an1}No one like
a kiss-up, Carl.

22:44.988 --> 22:46.823

22:46.907 --> 22:48.450
