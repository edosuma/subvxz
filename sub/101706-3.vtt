10:58.396 --> 11:00.355
Probably why they assigned
a dinosaur like me

11:00.398 --> 11:02.400
to work them.Well, business slowed.

11:02.444 --> 11:03.750
Mafia's influence declined.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.795
Today, the family is
on its last breath.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.231
Hasn't stopped them from trying

11:07.275 --> 11:08.972
to reclaim
their glory days, though.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.582
But now, with two agents dead,

11:10.626 --> 11:12.889
they've got our attention again.
You put the Mafia

11:12.933 --> 11:15.283
back on its heels, it makes themdesperate and dangerous.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.241
Look, if the FBI wants
to cross-swear my officers,

11:17.285 --> 11:18.765
consider it done.

11:18.808 --> 11:21.028
Rocco was supposed to testify
before a grand jury

11:21.071 --> 11:22.725
in three days.Except somebody

11:22.769 --> 11:24.422
located the safe house,
killed those two agents,

11:24.466 --> 11:25.728
and now Rocco's in the wind.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.295
Without his testimony,
the Venuti family

11:27.338 --> 11:28.775
stays open for business.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.081
Besides those two agents,
they also shot a civilian.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.779
They'll kill anybodyto get at Rocco.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.042
Well, then let's find him first.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.612
CHRIS: Put out feelersat nearby hospitals.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.484
Witnesses say Rocco
was bleeding pretty badly

11:42.527 --> 11:43.964
when he fled the scene.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.835
Maybe we can catch him
looking for medical attention.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.619
Rocco's not the bossof the Venuti family,

11:47.663 --> 11:49.447
but he's been
a loyal captain for years.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.449
His little brother Tony became
a soldier this year.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.147
CHRIS:Rocco agreed to talk to the FBI.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.801
Makes him a rat in their eyes.

11:54.844 --> 11:56.716
Can't be many people
he can trust.Well, the only person

11:56.759 --> 11:58.500
that he spoke to since
the FBI arrested him:

11:58.543 --> 11:59.849
his ex-wife, Gina.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.851
They've spoken a few
times, actually.

12:01.895 --> 12:02.852
She lives in Northridge.

12:02.896 --> 12:03.853
Trauma nurse.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.202
Maybe he'll contact her again.

12:05.246 --> 12:06.856
STREET:
FBI safe houses

12:06.900 --> 12:08.379
are supposed to be confidential.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.555
We checked the phone records
of the only three people

12:10.599 --> 12:11.861
who knew the address.

12:11.905 --> 12:13.733
One of them,an FBI clerk,

12:13.776 --> 12:15.386
received a call a few days ago

12:15.430 --> 12:16.823
from an illegal gambling den
downtown.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.563
Could be one of
Venuti's places.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.740
The mob controls most
backroom gambling in the city.

12:20.783 --> 12:21.871
DEACON: And that FBI clerkcould've leaked

12:21.915 --> 12:22.959
that info to the mob.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.221
Let the Feds worry
about their leak.

12:24.265 --> 12:25.875
Chris, you and I'll talk
to the ex-wife.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.877
Street, you update Hondo, and
check out that gambling site.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.487
Okay.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.276
Commander, you got a minute?

12:35.319 --> 12:36.930
Sure. What
do you need?

12:36.973 --> 12:38.192
Advice.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.237
A guy I grew up within my neighborhood,

12:40.281 --> 12:42.239
serving a long sentence,said he's up for parole

12:42.283 --> 12:43.893
seven years earlierthan expected.

12:43.937 --> 12:45.286
Does that sound possible?

12:45.329 --> 12:47.592
Well, the state's looking
to save resources

12:47.636 --> 12:48.942
due to prison
overcrowding.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.900
The pandemic's
played a role, too.

12:50.944 --> 12:52.902
Inmates in good standing
have a better chance

12:52.946 --> 12:54.599
of getting out
early release.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.906
Well, believe me, it's somethingwe plan on keeping our eye on

12:56.950 --> 12:59.082
once they start
hitting the streets.Sir, sir, it's not that.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.431
It's not that.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.694
He asked me if I would
speak on his behalf

13:02.738 --> 13:04.000
with the parole board.

13:04.044 --> 13:05.785
As a sergeant of the LAPD?

13:06.829 --> 13:08.352
How do you feel about it?

13:08.396 --> 13:09.832
Real talk?

13:09.876 --> 13:11.834
He's the closest thing I have
to an old-school brother.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.445
But he also made decisions thatlanded him behind bars.

13:14.489 --> 13:17.274
Many times.
Yeah, serious stuff.

13:17.318 --> 13:20.234
Well, if you're askingif I approve of you

13:20.277 --> 13:22.062
speaking on his behalf,I say this:

13:22.105 --> 13:25.717
I trust your judgment
and whatever you decide to do.

13:25.761 --> 13:27.328
But the question is

13:27.371 --> 13:30.157
do you trust your pal
to stay clean?

13:38.643 --> 13:40.080
Got it.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.387
According to Vice,
this is the spot.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.824
It may not look it,
but behind that taco joint's

13:44.867 --> 13:46.390
a mini Vegas.

13:46.434 --> 13:48.697
Hey, what up, Chino?

13:48.740 --> 13:51.569
Not every day you see a tacojoint with its own bouncer.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.789
Rival bangers drop weapons
and beef at the door

13:53.833 --> 13:55.617
for a chance to gamble
big-time money inside.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.358
All right, let's join the party.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.450
I'll let the Feds know.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.104
This is 20-David.We'll cover the front.

14:04.147 --> 14:05.757
You guys enter the back.

14:05.801 --> 14:08.804
AGENT:
Roger that, 20-David.
FBI going in.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.501
No, no, no, no, no.
Take it easy, big man.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.416
You reach, we teach.Put it on the table.

14:14.505 --> 14:16.290
LAPD and FBI.We got a search warrant.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.469
[scoffs]

14:21.512 --> 14:24.994
AGENT:
This is the FBI.
I want everyone out.

14:25.038 --> 14:28.302
Down on the ground.
Everyone, take a seat.

14:28.345 --> 14:30.043
Anybody here not got a warrant?

14:32.393 --> 14:33.698
Yeah, well, listen up.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.178
If y'all want leniency,
somebody's gotta tell me

14:35.222 --> 14:37.485
who's running this joint.

14:37.528 --> 14:41.097
Since you interrupted my games,
we might as well chat.

14:41.141 --> 14:43.447
Right this way, ma'am.Let's go.

14:46.581 --> 14:49.018
Street, help the Feds
get these guys out of here.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.933
On your feet.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.196
Sorry, folks, looks liketoday's not your lucky day.

14:53.240 --> 14:56.199
I recognize you
from Vice reports. Lulu Wan.

14:56.243 --> 14:57.940
I thought you ran withMTS out of Garden Grove.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.594
Petty theft and dice games.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.509
That was so last year.You're Korean.

15:01.552 --> 15:03.554
You're Chinese.
What of it, pretty boy?

15:03.598 --> 15:05.774
Backroom games areMafia territory.

15:05.817 --> 15:08.124
How'd you get permissionfrom the mob to run this place?

15:08.168 --> 15:09.821
Venuti family got desperate.

15:09.865 --> 15:11.301
They don't have
the manpower to run

15:11.345 --> 15:12.650
their own businesses anymore,

15:12.694 --> 15:15.175
so they started selling
their establishments

15:15.218 --> 15:16.916
to me and others.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.395
Well, somebody in there
called the Feds and got

15:18.439 --> 15:19.962
an address to a safe house.Wasn't me or my people.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.965
Had to be Peter Venuti.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.490
[sighs]
Venuti's head of the family.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.623
Before he
became the boss,

15:28.666 --> 15:31.234
he had almost 33 bodiesconnected to him.Venuti still thinks the mob

15:31.278 --> 15:33.106
can make a comeback,
but it's over for them.

15:33.149 --> 15:34.934
We think he's hunting
an ex-captain of his,

15:34.977 --> 15:37.153
Rocco Contoursi.I know about Rocco.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.850
We all work the same rackets.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.287
He agreed to talk to the Feds.

15:40.330 --> 15:43.594
But, uh, if Rocco's own
brother wants him dead,

15:43.638 --> 15:45.596
I don't know who
I can point you to.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.817
Rocco's kid brother Tony.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.253
You're saying he'sworking with Venuti

15:50.297 --> 15:51.602
to hunt down his own brother?

15:51.646 --> 15:52.995
Nice family, right?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.349
Deadline just passed.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.655
They're listing
all the applicants

16:00.698 --> 16:02.396
for the T.L.I. competition.

16:03.701 --> 16:04.964
I didn't know you madeclimbing cadre.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.617
A couple years ago.

16:06.661 --> 16:09.272
I had to crawl over Rocker
to get it. Literally.[chuckles]

16:09.316 --> 16:11.448
Who's coming in second to you?

16:11.492 --> 16:13.450
Sullivan from 70-Squad has apretty good record in the field.

16:13.494 --> 16:14.799
But he doesn't have
many cadres,

16:14.843 --> 16:17.106
and he's terrible at interviews.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.935
Bernard and Scura,
from 40-Squad.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.590
They'll be more focusedon taking each other downthan winning.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.811
Hey, hold up.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.422
Did you know Tan and Street
were signing up?

16:28.465 --> 16:30.641
No.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.165
Shouldn't be a problem.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.950
You've got seniority over them.

16:39.737 --> 16:43.219
Ms. Albert,thank you for coming in.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.134
Has your ex-husband
tried to contact you

16:45.178 --> 16:47.049
in the last 24 hours?

16:47.093 --> 16:50.531
Why would Rocco do that?There's a reason I'm an ex.

16:50.574 --> 16:52.489
Venuti's after him.
Rocco's injured.

16:52.533 --> 16:55.318
Might have no other options.

16:55.362 --> 16:58.626
First time Rocco and I met
was in an ICU.

16:58.669 --> 17:01.324
He came in after some bar fight.

17:01.368 --> 17:04.023
I'm a nurse, soI treated his injuries.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.111
What can I say?

17:05.154 --> 17:07.026
I got a thing for damaged guys.

17:07.069 --> 17:09.115
But after we got married,

17:09.158 --> 17:10.986
I told him I wouldn't clean up
his blood anymore.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.076
Your ex is a Mafia captain.
Didn't that bother you?

17:14.120 --> 17:16.078
I know Rocco has donesome bad things,

17:16.122 --> 17:18.907
but for the people he loves,there is nothing he wouldn't do.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.127
He agreed to testify againstthe family, didn't he?

17:21.170 --> 17:22.998
Maybe he's changing
for the better.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.174
Do you know where he is?

17:27.133 --> 17:28.699
You still love him, don't you?

17:28.743 --> 17:31.746
Look, Rocco's
third-generation mob.

17:31.789 --> 17:33.748
He's got a lot of pride.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.793
None of us want to die
on our knees.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.795
Right now, he's out
there all alone,

17:37.839 --> 17:39.884
and if Venuti catches up
to him before we do,

17:39.928 --> 17:42.061
how do you think that ends?

17:42.104 --> 17:44.411
You really think
you can save him?

17:44.454 --> 17:45.803
DEACON:
We're his best shot.

17:45.847 --> 17:48.545
With your help.

18:01.993 --> 18:03.778
That's the signal.
He's here.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.440
Che bella.

18:13.483 --> 18:14.919
Rocco.

18:17.966 --> 18:20.316
DEACON:
Rocco Contoursi, LAPD.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.408
I just want you to be safe.

18:25.452 --> 18:27.758
I know.CHRIS: Best for you
to come with us.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.020
Show us your hands.

18:29.064 --> 18:30.500
Yeah.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.342
Welcome to your new safe house.A lot safer than your last one.

18:46.386 --> 18:48.170
The FBI rescheduled
the grand jury for tomorrow,

18:48.214 --> 18:49.867
so you can sit tight
here until then.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.696
Gina's a good woman. Tell her
I don't blame her for this.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.959
But I'm not testifying.

18:55.003 --> 18:57.571
Your deal with the FBI ishanging by a thread as it is.

18:57.614 --> 18:59.486
I had nothing to do with
those two Feds getting killed.

18:59.529 --> 19:01.270
Your crime family
stormed the safe house

19:01.314 --> 19:02.358
and you fled the scene.

19:02.402 --> 19:03.968
Tell us a different story.

19:04.012 --> 19:06.797
They tried to kill me, too.

19:06.841 --> 19:08.190
You pick up my brother?No.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.192
Tony's still in the wind.Find him.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.585
Find him, and then I'll talk.

19:11.628 --> 19:13.369
You got a lot of love
for a brother who tried to

19:13.413 --> 19:15.110
put a bullet in you.Tony's a good kid.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.546
He's only been a soldier
for a few months.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.548
Venuti brought him
to that safe house,

19:18.592 --> 19:21.203
put a gun in his hand
to kill me.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.552
His own brother.

19:22.596 --> 19:25.033
Loyalty test.Tony couldn't pull the trigger.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.556
That's why things
went sideways.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.949
One of the Feds
went for his piece,

19:27.992 --> 19:29.472
everybody started
shooting at each other.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.692
It spilled outside. I grabbed
the car keys and split.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.911
I don't love what
I did for Venuti,

19:33.955 --> 19:35.391
but it put steaks
in the freezer.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.915
I only asked him one thing:
keep my brother out of it.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.569
Times got hard for Venuti.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.528
He broke his word,
recruited Tony.

19:41.571 --> 19:43.704
So that's why you cuta deal with the Feds.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.923
I made same deal with the FBI
as I did with Venuti.

19:45.967 --> 19:48.230
Protect my brother and
I'll do whatever you ask.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.753
If you want us to save Tony,
then you've got to

19:49.797 --> 19:51.581
help us find Venuti.All the federal heat

19:51.625 --> 19:52.887
on his head, Venuti's
probably scrambling,

19:52.930 --> 19:54.410
trying to get out
of the country.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.107
He'll keep Tony alive
as his ace card,

19:56.151 --> 19:57.761
to keep me from talking.

19:57.805 --> 20:00.242
But once Venuti's in the clear,
he won't need Tony anymore.

20:00.286 --> 20:03.245
Venuti will be gone,

Hey, Mel, Venuti's gonna
need cash to leave the country

20:11.471 --> 20:14.256
and lay low; that kind of
ripcord costs plenty.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.127
More than a dying family has.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.912
All their rackets have dried up.

20:17.955 --> 20:19.914
What about family debts?
They seem desperate enough

20:19.957 --> 20:21.350
to call in markers.

20:21.394 --> 20:23.134
The FBI has years of the
family's financial history.

20:23.178 --> 20:25.136
I'll have my team send over
everything they have.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.225
Tan, grab Chris and Street

20:26.268 --> 20:28.401
and start digging throughthose files.

What a thankless beat.

Surveillance, informants,
auditing.

20:36.017 --> 20:39.281
Death by paperwork.
You never really get a win.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.283
When you do, another weed
just fills in the cracks.

20:41.327 --> 20:44.155
We got Venuti
in our sights, Mel.

20:44.199 --> 20:46.070
Now's our chance
to grab this family

20:46.114 --> 20:48.290

20:48.334 --> 20:50.118
Hey, I just got
your message, D. You good?

20:50.161 --> 20:52.120
Uh, not sure.

20:52.163 --> 20:55.819
Look, I just got out of class
and got a collect call.

20:55.863 --> 20:58.082
From prison.

20:58.126 --> 21:00.389
Your pop.

21:00.433 --> 21:02.304
Yeah. He said he might
be getting out early.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.567
He said you're gonna help him
with his parole hearing.

21:04.611 --> 21:07.004
[sighs]
No kidding.

21:07.048 --> 21:08.615
I'm sorry. I didn't know

21:08.658 --> 21:11.400
he was gonna reach out to you
like that. Um...

21:11.444 --> 21:14.185

21:14.229 --> 21:17.493

at the, uh...

How are you feeling

21:19.103 --> 21:21.105
about the possibility
of him being back?

21:21.149 --> 21:23.934
Excited, I guess.

21:23.978 --> 21:26.023
But nervous.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.112
I haven't seen him
in the real world

21:28.156 --> 21:29.636
since I was a little kid.

21:29.679 --> 21:32.378
I spent half of my life
trying to be like him

21:32.421 --> 21:34.945
and the last couple years
trying not to be.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.860
But if him getting out means
I can't live with you anymore,

21:36.904 --> 21:38.340
then I don't want that.

21:39.950 --> 21:42.039
Darryl,

21:42.083 --> 21:44.215

21:44.259 --> 21:46.348
As far as I'm concerned,

I'm always gonna be here for youfor anything you need.

with your father,

30:05.891 --> 30:07.762
I don't know. Maybe that's why

30:07.806 --> 30:11.679
the idea of losing to them
bothers me so much.

30:11.722 --> 30:14.813
They don't need to pretend likethings are working out for them.

30:18.860 --> 30:21.732
You remember
when I was trying out for SWAT

30:21.776 --> 30:22.864
and asked for your help,

30:22.908 --> 30:24.692
and you told me
you couldn't?

30:24.735 --> 30:27.086
You said
that I had to push myself.

30:27.129 --> 30:28.565
I had to do it without you.

30:28.609 --> 30:30.872
That was SWAT Academy.
This is totally different.

30:30.916 --> 30:33.048
I'm gonna tell you
the exact same thing.

30:33.092 --> 30:37.139
You don't needanyone else's help to beat them.

30:38.184 --> 30:39.881
And I got plans after work.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.970
Guess I'll see you tomorrow.

30:44.494 --> 30:47.019
[sighs]

30:47.062 --> 30:49.760
I heard you got something
on Venuti's next target.

30:49.804 --> 30:51.762
Let's hear it.I went through
all his businesses.

30:51.806 --> 30:53.068
I pulled anyone with ties

30:53.112 --> 30:54.461
to political contributions.
Found this.

30:54.504 --> 30:56.811
Meet Georgia Porter.In the '90s,

30:56.855 --> 30:58.682
she and her husband started
a string of car dealerships.

30:58.726 --> 31:00.641
FBI believes they used
start-up money from Venuti.

31:00.684 --> 31:02.686
Now she's a widow and one
of the richest women in L.A.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.427
Pulled her social media,
found this.

31:04.471 --> 31:07.953
She's hosting an exclusive
fundraiser at her Bel-Air house

31:07.996 --> 31:10.651
today for a Senate candidate,David Long.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.914
Agent Woods just called.

31:12.958 --> 31:15.134
The FBI fast-tracked the warrantto the security footage

31:15.177 --> 31:17.136
of Porter's gated community.
They're transferring it now.

31:17.179 --> 31:19.312
What's Venuti gonna steal
at a fundraiser?

31:19.355 --> 31:21.096
Security at these things
is surprisingly slim.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.446
Unelected Senate candidate
is a pretty low-risk job,

31:23.490 --> 31:24.665
but it's a black-tie event.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.232
A private event like
this-- it could cost

31:26.275 --> 31:27.668
up to 50 grand a plate.

31:27.711 --> 31:29.104
So to answer your question,
these guests--

31:29.148 --> 31:30.453
they'll be wearing watches
and jewelry

31:30.497 --> 31:31.628
that costs more than cars.TAN:Not to mention,

31:31.672 --> 31:33.195
Ms. Porter's worth
over a hundred mill.

31:33.239 --> 31:35.154
How much you think
she got stashed at her house?

31:35.197 --> 31:37.199
It'll be a straight
smash and grab.

31:37.243 --> 31:40.463
This is the security
feed at the main gate.

31:40.507 --> 31:42.509
These gates normally have an
attendant, but I don't see one.

31:42.552 --> 31:43.771
Roll it back.

31:49.385 --> 31:51.692
HICKS: Stop.DEACON: That's Venuti.

31:51.735 --> 31:52.693
He's with Tony.

31:52.736 --> 31:54.086
That was 15 minutes ago.

31:56.436 --> 31:59.700
Okay, everybody, listen up.
This is how it's gonna go.

31:59.743 --> 32:03.312
Everything you have on you,you put in those bags-- watches,

32:03.356 --> 32:06.272
wallets, cash, everything.

32:08.796 --> 32:10.754
You can go to hell.

32:10.798 --> 32:12.539
And you can come with us.

32:12.582 --> 32:14.976
Bring her upstairs.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.064
MAN:No, no.WOMAN:
No.

32:16.108 --> 32:17.892
[guests crying, murmuring]

32:17.936 --> 32:21.243
Kid, sometimes we get whatwe want, sometimes we don't.

32:21.287 --> 32:24.943
And you've been such a painin my ass, I've decided,

32:24.986 --> 32:26.945
you're not cut outfor this business.

32:26.988 --> 32:28.729
[groaning]

32:28.772 --> 32:30.383
[panting]

32:30.426 --> 32:32.167
[groans]

32:32.211 --> 32:33.647
[zip ties squeaking]

32:33.690 --> 32:34.909
[Tony panting]

32:34.953 --> 32:36.302
But I chose you.

32:36.345 --> 32:38.521
Really?

32:38.565 --> 32:42.047
You're just like your brother,and I drown rats.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.614
[crowd gasping]

32:44.658 --> 32:45.789
Come on.[Tony coughs]

32:45.833 --> 32:47.922
We got a safe to find.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.098
[coughing]

32:54.581 --> 32:56.061
[tires squeak]

33:00.891 --> 33:03.024
All right, Chris, the twoof you take the two side.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.548
Deac and I got the four.Street and Tan, sweep the house.

33:09.248 --> 33:12.164
24-David. I see two armed menguarding the tent with hostages.

33:12.207 --> 33:14.296
DEACON:
No sign of Venuti.

33:14.340 --> 33:15.732
[water bubbling]

33:15.776 --> 33:17.908
Someone's in the pool!That's Tony. We got to move.

33:17.952 --> 33:19.823
STREET:
26-David. No eyes on Venuti.

33:19.867 --> 33:21.042
But this house is massive.

33:21.086 --> 33:22.043
We give away positions,

33:22.087 --> 33:23.131
he'll have the advantage.

33:23.175 --> 33:24.306
Tony doesn't have time.
Initiate!

33:24.350 --> 33:26.482
LAPD!

33:28.397 --> 33:30.269
[guests screaming]

33:41.323 --> 33:43.717
LAPD!

33:43.760 --> 33:45.632
We got to get out of here.

33:46.937 --> 33:48.765
Little help?

33:48.809 --> 33:51.029
Get him up.

33:53.335 --> 33:55.511
Kill her.[gasps]

34:00.647 --> 34:03.432
Turn him over.[coughing]

34:03.476 --> 34:05.130
TAN:25-David.

34:05.173 --> 34:06.435
Venuti's on the move
out a side passage

34:06.479 --> 34:07.654
on the east side of the house.

34:07.697 --> 34:11.223
24-David in pursuit.

34:21.755 --> 34:23.626
[groans]

34:23.670 --> 34:24.671
[panting]

34:24.714 --> 34:26.325
24-David.

34:26.368 --> 34:28.196
Venuti's in custody.

34:29.371 --> 34:31.678
[panting]

34:31.721 --> 34:33.680
[indistinct radio transmission]

34:33.723 --> 34:38.119
Had to come down and seethe cuffs slapped on him myself.

34:38.163 --> 34:41.905
Well, safe to say, the Venuti
family is finished for good.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.211
Well, the brass hasalready moved me

34:43.255 --> 34:44.865
onto new black handsyndicates.

34:44.908 --> 34:46.258
It never really ends.

34:46.301 --> 34:47.868
Well, I thank you.

34:47.911 --> 34:51.176
Sometimes this job
seems thankless.

34:51.219 --> 34:53.700
I just want you to know
that's not always the case.

34:54.744 --> 34:57.225
Hey, good work, Alonso.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.532
I heard that was a hell
of a 40-meter sprint.

34:59.575 --> 35:01.925
It was way more than 40, sir.

35:32.304 --> 35:33.783
See I missed out
on all the fun.

35:33.827 --> 35:35.611
What, no bad guysto chase in Berlin, huh?

35:35.655 --> 35:36.873
Ha, hell no.
They won't let me loose

35:36.917 --> 35:38.179
on the streets in my off time.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.921
It's their loss.I see the T.L.I.
sign-ups closed.

35:40.964 --> 35:43.271
Chris, Street and Tan all
competing against each other.

35:43.315 --> 35:44.838
I didn't expect that.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.709
Yeah, sounds like things arealready getting kind of frosty.

35:46.753 --> 35:49.059
No, I see it in our drills here.Germans want

35:49.103 --> 35:50.931
to beat the Italians
who want to beat the French.

35:50.974 --> 35:53.020
Competition has a way
of sharpening steel.

35:53.063 --> 35:55.240
Or ruining chemistry.
I'll keep an eye on 'em.

35:55.283 --> 35:56.980
Yeah, I'll check up on 'em, too.

35:57.024 --> 35:59.069
Luca, bud, we miss you.Wait a minute.

35:59.113 --> 36:00.636
You're telling me I had to
travel halfway across the world

36:00.680 --> 36:02.290
to finally start
feeling the love?

36:03.161 --> 36:04.684
Hey, Luca, I don't knowwhat's going on.

36:04.727 --> 36:06.903
I think we're losing you, man.You're breaking up. Hey, Luca?

36:06.947 --> 36:08.601
Oh, hell no,
don't even think about...Luca, later.

36:08.644 --> 36:11.517
Hmm. Hey, Deac,
seriously, though,

36:11.560 --> 36:14.084
keep an eye on the
three young'uns.Will do.

36:14.128 --> 36:15.260
All right.

36:22.789 --> 36:24.704
Thought you had plans.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.619
Thought you needed more
range time to practice.

36:26.662 --> 36:28.273
Look at that grouping.

36:28.316 --> 36:29.622
My last shot was a hair wide.

36:29.665 --> 36:32.102
Well, you're probably
anticipating it,

36:32.146 --> 36:33.626
loosening your grip
just a little.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.715
Just my humble
two cents.

36:36.672 --> 36:38.935
Sorry, by the way. I, uh...

36:38.979 --> 36:41.111
I shouldn't have ghosted you
in SWAT Academy.

36:41.155 --> 36:43.636
I might have been thinking more
about my own image

36:43.679 --> 36:45.203
than what you needed.

36:45.246 --> 36:47.248
See, that's the crazy thing.
It waswhat I needed.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.859
You're right. Things are always
gonna be different for us.

36:49.903 --> 36:51.513
Harder.

36:51.557 --> 36:53.385
I needed to embrace that

36:53.428 --> 36:56.126
in order to push myself to be
the best that I could be.

36:57.127 --> 36:59.217
You taught me that.

37:00.261 --> 37:02.263
Thanks for reminding me.

37:02.307 --> 37:04.352
[click]I'm gonna kick their asses.

37:09.966 --> 37:11.968
[door shuts]

37:12.012 --> 37:14.057
HONDO:
Look, um...

37:15.102 --> 37:17.235
I don't mean to interrupt
your homework, uh...

37:19.454 --> 37:21.587
There's something
I got to talk about.

37:22.544 --> 37:24.329
Your pop.

37:24.372 --> 37:27.462
I want you to hear it
straight from me.

37:27.506 --> 37:32.337
I am not gonna speak on his
behalf at the parole hearing.

37:33.338 --> 37:34.991
[sighs]

37:35.035 --> 37:36.993
Hey.

37:37.037 --> 37:39.518
Listen to me. Please.

37:40.693 --> 37:43.652
When I was your age,

37:43.696 --> 37:45.698
my two best friends
never graduated high school.

37:45.741 --> 37:47.787
I was the only one.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.225
And my mom--
she was always on me

37:51.269 --> 37:53.488
about staying safe and hanging
out with the wrong crowd,

37:53.532 --> 37:54.924
and, you know, I just thought

37:54.968 --> 37:56.883
she was nagging me
too much, but...

37:58.972 --> 38:02.671
...it took me years to realize
that she was terrified.

38:03.803 --> 38:06.501
She was scared that I wouldn't
live to be a grown man.

38:08.503 --> 38:10.157
And, Darryl, you
are 17 years old,

38:10.200 --> 38:12.377
and you are so close
to making it.

38:14.030 --> 38:17.120
But you make
one wrong move,

38:17.164 --> 38:19.427
and your entire
life is different.

38:21.821 --> 38:24.824
You are in a phase of life,
being a Black man,

38:24.867 --> 38:27.217
that is vulnerable
and it is dangerous.

38:29.785 --> 38:32.788
Wrong place, wrong time,

38:32.832 --> 38:36.749
wrong people, wrong cops,

38:36.792 --> 38:38.751
and you're dead

38:38.794 --> 38:40.535
or in prison.

38:42.407 --> 38:46.062
You have worked too hard, and
we have come too far for that.

38:47.629 --> 38:51.024
D, I cannot gamble on you losingthe progress that you've made

38:51.067 --> 38:53.113
with anyone on this planet.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.421
Even your father.

38:59.685 --> 39:02.644
Now, if I truly thought that
he could lead a clean life,

39:02.688 --> 39:04.385
then maybe this would
be different, but...

39:04.429 --> 39:06.561
But you don't thinkthat's gonna happen?

39:09.477 --> 39:11.392
I just can't put my name

39:11.436 --> 39:13.960
on saying to a parole board
that he will.

39:19.095 --> 39:21.271
So that means
he's not getting out?

39:24.753 --> 39:26.799
I don't know.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.285
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

39:44.556 --> 39:46.079
So, it's "no," huh?

39:46.122 --> 39:48.342
That's how it is?

39:52.172 --> 39:54.000
Leroy...

39:54.043 --> 39:57.177
the first thing the board's
gonna ask me is if I think

39:57.220 --> 39:59.092
you're gonna get back to doing
dirt if you get released.

39:59.135 --> 40:01.442
And I'm not.Come on, man. Please.

40:01.486 --> 40:04.271
You've been pulling strings frombehind bars this whole time.

40:04.314 --> 40:06.273
What you think you're gonna do
when you get out of here?

40:06.316 --> 40:07.753
Be a barber or something?

40:07.796 --> 40:09.276
I don't planon coming back here.

40:09.319 --> 40:11.670
[laughs]

40:11.713 --> 40:14.107
All that talk
about changing the world,

40:14.150 --> 40:17.240
and you got no faith
in rehabilitation.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.244
Leroy, I wish you luck, man.

40:21.288 --> 40:24.117
I really do.

40:24.160 --> 40:27.207
But you're gonna have to do thisthing without my recommendation.

40:30.340 --> 40:33.822
Yo, we ain't done, man.Sit your bitch ass down.

40:37.957 --> 40:41.134
This really about protecting
your name as a cop,

40:41.177 --> 40:43.963
or is it about keeping my boy
to yourself?Okay.

40:44.006 --> 40:45.965
You know what? I wasn't trying
to bring Darryl into this.

40:46.008 --> 40:48.097
But you're the one
who reached out and called him.

40:48.141 --> 40:50.709
But since you're asking me,
it's about both, man.

40:50.752 --> 40:52.493
There's a version of this life
where you're sitting here

40:52.537 --> 40:53.973
instead of me.Don't do that.

40:54.016 --> 40:56.149
You made your own decisions,
Leroy!

40:56.192 --> 40:58.151
We both wanted revenge
for Big Darryl.

40:58.194 --> 40:59.805
I was just the one
who acted on it,

40:59.848 --> 41:03.461
did time for it,changed my trajectory.

41:05.854 --> 41:09.684
You know people tried
to kill me twice in here?

41:09.728 --> 41:12.078
Meanwhile, you out there,
living life,

41:12.121 --> 41:13.688
playing Daddy to my son.

41:13.732 --> 41:15.516
Something I gave you
permission to do.

41:15.560 --> 41:16.735
And it's what's best for Darryl!

41:16.778 --> 41:18.476
All the times I had your back,

41:18.519 --> 41:20.695
and you can't do this one thing
for me?!

41:20.739 --> 41:22.523
Leroy, you're my brother.

41:22.567 --> 41:24.830
No. Don't you evercall me that again.

41:24.873 --> 41:26.832
You want to leave mein here to rot?

41:26.875 --> 41:30.139
I will rain down smoke on yourass like you ain't never seen.

41:30.183 --> 41:31.140
You're gonna bring threats now?
