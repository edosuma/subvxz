00:02.252 --> 00:04.628
You guys, hurry up.
The flight leaves in four hours.

00:04.796 --> 00:07.506
There could be traffic.
The plane could leave early.

00:07.674 --> 00:11.510
When we get to London,
there could be a line at customs. Come on.

00:12.429 --> 00:16.598
Six-hour trip to London.
That's a lot of Monica.

00:17.600 --> 00:22.312
Passport, check. Camera, check.
Traveler's checks, check.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.815
- Who are you saying "check" to?
- Myself.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.608
For remembering to pack the thing.

00:26.776 --> 00:28.652
You know, you do a good thing,
you get a check.

00:31.614 --> 00:33.824
My mom does it.
I never realized it was weird.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.286
Hey, my mom used to put her head
in the oven, so...

00:37.454 --> 00:40.789
Actually, she only did it the one time.
But it was pretty weird.

00:43.626 --> 00:44.668
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.253
Hey. Are you ready yet?

00:46.421 --> 00:49.757
- Yep. You got the tickets?
- Oh, got them right here. Check.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.303
It's all London, baby. Here we go.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.182
You got your passport?

00:58.683 --> 01:02.394
Yeah, in my third drawer of my dresser.
You don't wanna lose that.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.026
- Oh.
- There it is.

01:58.034 --> 02:01.161
Okay, if you need the vacuum,
it's in my closet on the left side.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.705
The garbage bags
are next to the refrigerator.

02:03.873 --> 02:06.500
But Rachel's gonna be here too.
Can't I just ask her?

02:06.668 --> 02:08.961
Heh. Yeah, okay. Give that a try.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.880
- All right, let's do it.
- Woohoo.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.216
- Yeah. Cheerio.
- London, baby.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.928
- Because that's not gonna get annoying.
- London, baby!

02:19.931 --> 02:22.141
- Oh, you know what? I was wrong.
- Ha, ha.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.601
Well, we're all here.
I guess we should get going.

02:24.769 --> 02:27.062
Oh, I wanna come over there
and give you a hug...

02:27.230 --> 02:29.940
...and wish you luck on your wedding,
but I can't get up.

02:30.108 --> 02:33.735
- Oh, I'll come hug you.
- Great, can you bring me the newspaper?

02:34.404 --> 02:35.445
Yeah.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.781
- Have a great wedding. Oh.
- Thanks.

02:37.949 --> 02:40.117
- Hey, Chandler, I wanna hug you too.
- Hey.

02:40.285 --> 02:44.413
And you might as well bring me my book.
It's on the counter in your apartment.

02:45.582 --> 02:46.665
Oh.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.211
- So we're off.
- Have fun.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.880
- Thanks.
- Oh.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.716
Oh. I can't believe
you're not gonna be there.

02:55.884 --> 02:56.925
Oh, I know.

02:57.093 --> 02:59.678
- So come. Why don't you come?
- What?

02:59.846 --> 03:03.140
To London. Come to London. Please?
It would mean so much to me.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.517
Yeah, well, I gotta work. I'm sorry.

03:05.685 --> 03:10.647
- Why can't you take a couple of days off?
- Because I can't. I told you. No, I can't.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.024
This is my wedding.

03:13.318 --> 03:16.737
All right, you know what? Now we are late.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

03:18.781 --> 03:21.491
Fine, you'll watch it on video
when we get back.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.704
Here you go, Phoebe. Here you go, Phoebo,
Phoobala, Phobayboo.

03:30.001 --> 03:31.501
You. Ha, ha.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.463
All right, let's go. Bye, Pheebs.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.340
- Bye.
- Bye, Pheebs.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.009
Mwah. Goodbye. Mwah.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.636
- Bye.
- Safe flight.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.554
London, baby.

03:44.849 --> 03:47.893
- Oh, God.
- Oh. Do you need a hug?

03:49.312 --> 03:51.563
You don't have to bring me anything.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.665
All right, Chandler, do something.

04:11.042 --> 04:15.212
- Come on, do something.
- I am. I'm ignoring you.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.755
Okay, I'm gonna be
the on-camera guy. All right.

04:18.466 --> 04:22.761
First stop, Westminster Abbey.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.807
- Oh, what the hell is that?
- That's London, baby.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.850
All right, the hotel's here.

04:29.018 --> 04:31.603
Wait. No, we wanna go...

04:33.898 --> 04:35.524
No.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.234
I know.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.861
I'm gonna have to go into the map.

04:45.201 --> 04:48.662
Okay, if you see a little version
of me in there, kill it.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.372
I got it.

04:51.207 --> 04:52.749
Here we go.

04:54.377 --> 04:58.005
Okay, listen, listen, we're not gonna have
to walk this way the entire time, are we?

04:58.172 --> 04:59.464
Shh.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.175
Oh, man, you made me lose it.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.933
And that was all before 10:00.

05:10.101 --> 05:13.395
The caterer rang to say it's gonna be
chicken kiev instead of tarragon.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.856
The florist phoned
to say there aren't any tulips.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.525
Oh, and then the cellist
has carpal tunnel syndrome...

05:18.693 --> 05:20.736
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Emily, honey. Okay?

05:20.903 --> 05:23.113
- Well, up yours too.
- What?

05:23.740 --> 05:26.783
- No, no. That's "time-out."
- Sorry.

05:26.951 --> 05:30.829
Sweetie, you gotta relax.
Everything's gonna be great, okay?

05:30.997 --> 05:32.789
Come on, come on.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.544
- Chicken kiev?
Mm-hm.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.255
Doesn't that sound delicious
at the last minute?

05:40.423 --> 05:42.632
I know, but something like salmon
would just...

05:42.800 --> 05:45.093
It would be so much more elegant
than chicken.

05:45.261 --> 05:48.263
And you wouldn't have to worry
about the salmonella.

05:48.973 --> 05:50.432
Oh.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.851
I can't wait to see
where you're getting married.

05:53.019 --> 05:56.438
Yes. This place is beautiful.
Emily's parents got married here.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.690
I still can't believe
they're tearing it down.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.360
It really is the most lovely building
you'll ever see.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.944
I mean, it's over...

06:06.157 --> 06:07.616
Oh, my God.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.619
It's nice.

06:19.003 --> 06:22.005
Oh. Oh, my God.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.424
How can this be happening?
What are we gonna do?

06:24.592 --> 06:26.510
Everything's gonna be all right.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.971
- How is it gonna be all right?
- Uh-huh, I see that.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.308
Okay, I talked to the guy
and found out what happened.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.811
- What?
- They tore it down a few days early.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.817
All right.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.027
Westminster Abbey.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.780
Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.366
Hey.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.826
Okay.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.036
What do you think of the abbey,
Chandler?

06:53.871 --> 06:57.040
Oh, I think it's great.
They're thinking of changing the name.

06:57.208 --> 07:00.419
- Really? To what?
- To "Put the Camera Away."

07:01.671 --> 07:04.464
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.

07:12.348 --> 07:15.559
- Honey, don't get up. What do you need?
- Oh, no. Oh, nothing.

07:15.726 --> 07:18.937
Come on. I'm here to take care of you.
What do you need? Anything.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.981
Okay, I have a wedgie.

07:23.693 --> 07:24.943
Okay, that is all you.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.157
So, what do you want for lunch?

07:30.324 --> 07:32.367
Oh, I don't know.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.829
- I guess we have to eat.
- Yeah, I do.

07:37.039 --> 07:38.623
What's the matter?

07:38.791 --> 07:41.626
I'm just bummed
the way I left things with Ross.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.087
I wish I didn't lie to him
about having to work.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.672
He seemed so mad at me.

07:45.840 --> 07:49.593
Ah, don't be so hard on yourself.
If someone I was still in love with was...

07:49.760 --> 07:52.679
- Still in love with?
- Yeah.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.264
I'm not in love with Ross.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.099
Oh.

07:58.060 --> 08:00.228
No, no. Good.

08:00.396 --> 08:01.980
Yeah, me neither.

08:02.899 --> 08:06.193
Phoebe, I'm not going to Ross' wedding,
because he's my ex-boyfriend...

08:06.360 --> 08:09.154
...and that would be
really uncomfortable.

08:09.322 --> 08:13.658
Not because I'm still in love with him.
Hey, I like Ross as much as the next guy.

08:13.826 --> 08:17.454
You know, clearly I have feelings for him,
but feelings don't mean love.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.790
You know, I mean,
do I still have loving feelings for Ross?

08:20.958 --> 08:22.709
Yeah.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.754
I have continuing feelings of love.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.548
But that doesn't mean
that I'm still in love with him.

08:28.716 --> 08:32.469
You know, I mean, I have sexual feelings
for him, but I do love him.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.765
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

08:37.933 --> 08:39.851
Why didn't you tell me?

08:41.479 --> 08:43.813
- We thought you knew.
- We?

08:43.981 --> 08:47.067
Yeah, we all know.
We talk about it all the time.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.529
You all know? Does Ross know?

08:50.696 --> 08:53.657
Oh, no. Ross doesn't know anything.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.700
Oh. I cannot believe you didn't tell me.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.703
Because we thought you knew.
It's so obvious.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.706
God, it would be like, you know,
telling Monica:

09:01.874 --> 09:04.209
"Hey," you know, "you like things clean."

09:08.214 --> 09:09.256
Hi.

09:09.423 --> 09:11.675
So, what are you fine gentlemen
in the market for?

09:11.842 --> 09:16.471
- We've got scarves, souvenir postcards.
- Check this out, huh?

09:17.014 --> 09:18.390
Oh, yeah.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.850
That's the stuff. What do you think?

09:21.018 --> 09:24.396
Well, I'm not gonna have to buy that
"I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.941
Well, I like it. Here you go.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.861
You're not really gonna buy that. Don't you
think you've embarrassed me enough?

09:32.029 --> 09:33.488
Oh, I embarrass you?

09:33.656 --> 09:36.700
How can I answer that
when I'm pretending I don't know you?

09:37.535 --> 09:40.495
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in.
All Londoners wear them.

09:40.663 --> 09:44.833
Oh, really? Then how come no one here
anywhere is wearing one?

09:45.001 --> 09:47.252
They're all tourists.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.423
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that
in public, you know...

09:51.591 --> 09:55.176
...you're gonna spend the rest
of the afternoon all by yourself.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.970
Oh, yeah?

10:00.933 --> 10:04.311
If you're gonna make me choose
between you and the hat, I choose the hat.

10:04.478 --> 10:05.520
- Good choice.
- Thanks.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.731
Okay, look. All right, that's it, okay?

10:07.898 --> 10:11.192
I'm out of here.
I'm not gonna be embarrassed anymore.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.495
- Hello?
- Hey.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.706
I just spoke to your dad,
and you know what?

10:24.874 --> 10:27.083
He thinks we'll be able
to find a new place.

10:27.251 --> 10:30.003
- We don't have to.
- What, you found a place?

10:30.171 --> 10:33.423
No, but Monica and I were talking...

10:33.591 --> 10:36.760
...and I was so upset about the hall
being knocked down...

10:36.927 --> 10:39.971
...and she suggested
that we just put the wedding off for a bit.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.935
- She said what?
- She said if I'm not happy...

10:46.103 --> 10:49.981
...getting married somewhere we can find
in a day, well, we should just postpone it.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.361
Postpone it? Heh.

10:56.072 --> 11:00.325
Emily, do you think Monica realizes how
much our parents spent on this wedding?

11:00.493 --> 11:05.038
Huh? Do you think my sister's teeny,
tiny little brain comprehends...

11:05.206 --> 11:07.624
...that people took time
out of their lives...

11:07.792 --> 11:10.710
...to fly thousands of miles
to be here? Huh?

11:14.882 --> 11:16.049
This isn't right.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.469
I realize that people
are gonna be disappointed.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.014
But they'll come back
when we can do it right.

11:23.182 --> 11:26.685
Well, I can't ask people to do that.
Would you ask people to do that?

11:26.852 --> 11:28.436
Don't you point your pants at me.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.981
We have no choice.

11:32.149 --> 11:35.068
Anywhere that's half-decent
will have been booked months ago.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.779
Ross, don't you understand?
This is our wedding.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.865
The only thing I understand
is postponing it is not an option.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.659
This is when we're getting married.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.954
- What are you saying, it's now or never?
- No, I'm saying it's now.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.540
- Or?
- There's no "or" in mine.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.625
What is wrong with these pants?

11:53.003 --> 11:55.797
It's not the pants.
It's you who's backwards.

11:55.965 --> 11:59.134
And if you don't understand
how important this is to me...

11:59.301 --> 12:01.594
...perhaps we shouldn't
be getting married at all.

12:01.762 --> 12:04.013
Emily, no. Wait, stop. Emily, please...

12:13.899 --> 12:15.817
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:15.985 --> 12:19.112
So did shopping help you feel any better
about Ross?

12:19.280 --> 12:22.157
Manhattan does not have enough stores.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.952
Well, I think I can help you get over him.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.454
- You can?
- Yeah.

12:27.621 --> 12:30.206
I just need you to bring me
some photos of Ross...

12:30.374 --> 12:33.084
...and, um, a small piece of chocolate...

12:33.252 --> 12:35.253
...and a glass of tepid water.

12:35.421 --> 12:39.674
Ooh. Is this one of those things where you
throw stuff in a bag with graveyard dirt...

12:39.842 --> 12:41.885
...and hang it from a north-facing tree?

12:42.052 --> 12:44.637
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too.

12:46.807 --> 12:49.517
The pictures are for you.
The chocolate and water's for me.

12:49.685 --> 12:51.519
I just didn't feel like getting up.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.648
Okay. I'm gonna show you
a picture of Ross, okay...

12:55.816 --> 12:59.194
...and you're going to remember
all the bad things about him, all right?

12:59.361 --> 13:01.821
- Really focus on his flaws.
- I can do that.

13:01.989 --> 13:04.532
Certainly did that
while we were going out. Heh.

13:04.700 --> 13:05.867
Okay. Mm.

13:06.035 --> 13:09.370
Before we get started, I just wanna say,
for the record, I love Ross.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.289
I think he's such a great guy.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.338
Okay. Now close your eyes.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.674
- And imagine that you're with Ross.
- Mm-hm.

13:21.842 --> 13:24.677
- Okay, and imagine that you're kissing him.
- Mm-hm.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.889
You're running your hands
all over his body.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.600
And then you run your hands
through his hair...

13:30.768 --> 13:34.813
...but, oh, ew, gross,
it's some kind of grease, it's... Ugh.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.065
Ah?

13:38.400 --> 13:40.068
I don't know.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.987
I don't know,
his hair never bothered me that much.

13:43.155 --> 13:46.825
And you know, it was always more crunchy
than it was greasy.

13:47.451 --> 13:50.036
Okay. This is gonna be harder
than I thought.

13:50.204 --> 13:53.206
Um, ahem.
Let's try some aversion therapy.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.958
- Okay. All right.
- Okay? All right.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.417
- Look at the picture.
- Okay.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.419
All right, and, um...

14:00.381 --> 14:01.548
Ow!

14:05.261 --> 14:08.972
- Okay. How do you feel now?
- Well, I like you less.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.113
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:28.951 --> 14:32.620
- Oh. Sorry.
- No, no, you know what? I'm sorry.

14:32.788 --> 14:35.039
I shouldn't have said
you were embarrassing me.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.499
That really wasn't cool.

14:36.667 --> 14:40.795
And if it makes you feel any better,
I've had a really lousy day.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.381
Me too.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.258
- Yeah?
- No!

14:46.844 --> 14:48.678
I had the best day ever.

14:50.097 --> 14:52.682
Dude, check this out.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.268
- Hey.
- Shh, shh, shh.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.230
Say hi to my friend
and tell him you like my hat.

14:59.398 --> 15:02.442
- Okay, so, what's your friend's name?
- Oh. Chandler.

15:02.610 --> 15:03.693
Hi, Chandler.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.653
That's... That's...

15:05.821 --> 15:08.156
- Oh, my God.
- That's Fergie, baby!

15:09.700 --> 15:14.329
Joey says you don't really like his hat,
but I think it's kind of dashing.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.289
When did you...? How...?

15:16.498 --> 15:19.167
I was trying to figure out
how to get to Buckingham Palace.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.710
So I'm in my map and...

15:22.004 --> 15:23.046
Hey.

15:23.213 --> 15:24.505
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:24.673 --> 15:26.758
I understand you had a little talk
with Emily.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.594
Ha, ha. Yes, I did.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.305
And you are welcome.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.266
Am I?

15:36.268 --> 15:38.811
And was it your idea
to postpone the wedding?

15:40.564 --> 15:41.606
Um...

15:42.024 --> 15:44.525
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Wait up.

15:46.236 --> 15:50.531
Hey, hey, since you're the fix-it lady,
here's a pickle:

15:50.699 --> 15:54.953
What do you do when the bride says
she doesn't wanna have the wedding at all?

15:55.537 --> 15:57.246
- She said that?
- Yeah.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.831
- Why?
- I don't know.

15:58.999 --> 16:02.710
I told her it was stupid to put off the
wedding just because the hall was gone...

16:02.878 --> 16:05.004
...and she, like, flipped out.

16:05.172 --> 16:08.591
Oh, my God.
You're even dumber than I am.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.719
Excuse me?

16:11.887 --> 16:14.889
Ross, how long
have you been planning this wedding?

16:15.057 --> 16:16.182
I don't know. A month?

16:16.350 --> 16:19.769
Emily has probably been planning it
since she was 5.

16:19.937 --> 16:23.439
Ever since the first time she took
a pillowcase and hung it off her head.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.276
That's what we did.

16:27.444 --> 16:30.697
We dreamed about the perfect wedding.

16:30.864 --> 16:33.574
In the perfect place.

16:33.742 --> 16:36.911
With the perfect four-tiered wedding cake.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.539
With the little people on top.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.926
But the most important part...

16:52.094 --> 16:54.679
...is that we had the perfect guy...

16:54.847 --> 16:58.766
...who understood just how important
all that other stuff was.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.937
I had no idea.

17:03.814 --> 17:08.026
That pillowcase thing, I thought you guys
were just doing The Flying Nun.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.155
Sometimes we were.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.742
Come on.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.785
You gotta help me figure out what to do.

17:17.953 --> 17:18.994
- Okay?
- All right.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.579
Come on.

17:24.292 --> 17:27.211
- Whoa. Pretty intense, huh?
- Yeah.

17:28.088 --> 17:32.425
I hope Ross didn't think we went in there
because we were uncomfortable out here.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.224
I hope he did.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.318
- Hello?
- Hey, Pheebs, it's Joey.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.862
Hey, Joey. Hey. Ooh, ooh.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.865
I just saw someone that looks just like you
on the subway.

17:56.033 --> 18:00.495
I was gonna go over and say hi, but then
I figured he doesn't care he looks like you.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.540
That just cost me 4 bucks.

18:05.292 --> 18:08.544
I just called to see how the chick
and the duck are doing.

18:08.712 --> 18:10.797
They're having a great time
with Aunt Phoebe.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.382
Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.593
So do you miss me?

18:15.761 --> 18:18.596
Kind of,
but I've just been having way too much fun.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.264
Oh, so you're not homesick yet?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.893
No, I don't think so.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.395
All right, well, the seven of us miss you.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.318
- Who's seven?
- Well, you know, me, Rachel...

18:32.486 --> 18:33.861
...the birds, the babies.

18:34.029 --> 18:36.697
Aw, the babies miss me?

18:38.617 --> 18:41.494
- Ooh, pizza guy's here.
- What? You ordered pizza without me?

18:42.746 --> 18:46.165
Yeah, but we were thinking about you.
We ordered the Joey Special.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.000
Two pizzas?

18:49.378 --> 18:53.798
- Yeah. Okay, gotta go. Talk to you later.
- Wait, wait. Where did you get it from?

19:00.514 --> 19:03.683
Where everybody knows your name

19:06.186 --> 19:09.397
And they're always glad you came

19:10.566 --> 19:15.528
You wanna be where you can see
The troubles are all the same

19:15.696 --> 19:19.532
You wanna be
Where everybody knows your name

19:24.371 --> 19:28.332
- Monica, why have you brought me here?
- You'll see.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.460
I tell you,
this wedding is not gonna happen.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.839
Oh, Ross.

19:35.007 --> 19:41.512
Okay? But imagine a lot more lights, okay,
and, you know, fewer bricks...

19:41.680 --> 19:43.598
...and flowers and candles.

19:43.765 --> 19:46.601
Okay, and the musicians,
they can go over here, okay?

19:46.768 --> 19:49.061
And the chairs,
they can face this way and...

19:49.646 --> 19:51.230
You go.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.817
But if you don't love this,
then we'll do it any other place...

19:54.985 --> 19:56.027
...any other time.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.447
Really, it's fine. Whatever you want.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.742
It's perfect.

20:03.327 --> 20:07.163
- And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...
- Well, then we'll get wet.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.293
Aw.

20:13.629 --> 20:14.962
I don't even have a date.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.133
- Pheebs?
- Yeah?

20:19.301 --> 20:21.344
Do you remember where the duck food is?

20:21.511 --> 20:24.263
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment,
under the sink. Why?

20:24.431 --> 20:26.474
Because I'm going to London.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.893
What? What do you mean,
you're going to London?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.020
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.

20:31.188 --> 20:34.815
Now, honey, you take care, and you don't
have those babies till I get back. Mwah.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.735
Rachel, you can't go. Ross loves Emily.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.988
I know, I know, I know he does,
but I have to tell him how I feel.

20:41.156 --> 20:45.451
He deserves to have all of the information.
Then he can make an informed decision.

20:45.619 --> 20:48.829
That's not why you're going.
You're going because you hope he'll say:

20:48.997 --> 20:52.792
"Yeah, I love you too, Rach.
Forget about that British chippie."

20:54.169 --> 20:55.211
Do you think he will?

20:55.379 --> 20:59.173
No, because he's in love
with the British chippie.

21:00.467 --> 21:04.720
Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna
mess with his head and ruin his wedding.

21:04.888 --> 21:07.515
You know? It's too late.
You missed your chance.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.476
I'm sorry. I know this must be really hard.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.146
But it's over.

21:17.651 --> 21:20.945
You know what? No.
It's not over until someone says "I do."

21:21.697 --> 21:24.699
I do. I do! I do!

21:30.455 --> 21:33.791
Yeah, like I can really chase you.
I'm carrying a litter.
