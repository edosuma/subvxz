WEBVTT

00:01.148 --> 00:02.467
PETE: <i>So, Andre, whatever
happened with Gibiatti?</i>

00:02.597 --> 00:04.230
You're never gonna
believe this, right?

00:04.266 --> 00:05.564
That girl he was dating,
she gets pregnant,

00:05.600 --> 00:06.933
he dumps her, case dropped.

00:07.018 --> 00:10.338
Gentlemen, I have big news
about my charity organization,

00:10.458 --> 00:12.375
Taco Cares.
Pete no cares.

00:12.460 --> 00:15.378
We are starting a new venture,
and it's called,

00:15.463 --> 00:17.013
the Little Eskimo
Brothers Program.

00:17.098 --> 00:18.514
KEVIN:
Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.300
Taco, please tell me you are not
teaching children to have sex.

00:21.353 --> 00:22.385
Are you crazy?

00:22.470 --> 00:24.053
I'd never teach
a child anything.

00:24.139 --> 00:25.805
Besides, I don't want
to waste a bed.

00:25.890 --> 00:29.058
Now, the Little Eskimo Brothers
Program will allow adults

00:29.144 --> 00:30.977
who are staying at the EBDBBnB

00:31.029 --> 00:32.612
to also mentor a child
while they're there.

00:32.647 --> 00:34.947
You know, give something back.

00:34.983 --> 00:37.316
As long as it's not, like,
their gonorrhea or syphilis.

00:37.402 --> 00:38.951
All right, enough, I don't want
to talk about sex anymore,

00:38.987 --> 00:41.404
especially kids and sex.

00:41.456 --> 00:44.107
Ellie's starting SexEd at school,

00:44.227 --> 00:45.216
so yeah.

00:45.336 --> 00:47.820
Wait, w-wait, wait, wait, wait,
Ellie is learning about sex?

00:48.045 --> 00:49.802
Isn't she a little old for that?

00:49.922 --> 00:51.714
So crazy, it feels like just yesterday

00:51.800 --> 00:53.549
she was this sweet young
innocent girl,

00:53.635 --> 00:56.169
using the word suck-stick
without knowing what it meant.

00:56.221 --> 00:58.421
And to top it off, she's getting
bullied in the class.

00:58.506 --> 01:00.890
Ooh, I'm having a huge problem
with bullying on my face.

01:00.975 --> 01:02.842
Wait, isn't that just violence?

01:02.927 --> 01:04.227
Bullying's a tricky issue, man.

01:04.312 --> 01:05.595
I feel like back in our day,

01:05.680 --> 01:07.146
the worst thing
that happened to a girl

01:07.182 --> 01:08.765
if she was called fat is she
just ended up dating Ruxin.

01:08.850 --> 01:10.149
Kids have it tough nowadays.

01:10.185 --> 01:12.068
I mean, I'm just thankful
I was never bullied.

01:12.153 --> 01:13.686
(coughs, laughs)

01:13.772 --> 01:14.854
Dude, what did you just say?
What?

01:14.939 --> 01:16.322
I'm not proud of this,

01:16.357 --> 01:18.324
but you were severely
bullied by us.

01:18.359 --> 01:20.610
Oh, n-n-no, we all
bullied each other.

01:20.695 --> 01:22.195
Are you kidding me?
Our nicknames for you

01:22.280 --> 01:24.247
became so popular the teachers
started calling you them.

01:24.332 --> 01:27.033
Yeah, Miss Hamilton roll-called
you as "Anal Bead."

01:27.085 --> 01:28.584
I actually thought
your name was Anal Bead

01:28.670 --> 01:30.119
and your nickname was "Andre."

01:30.205 --> 01:32.088
I gave it back to
you guys tenfold.

01:32.173 --> 01:34.707
Remember, they used to call me
the Vip... I was the Viper.

01:34.759 --> 01:35.875
Because your breath
was so horrible.

01:35.927 --> 01:36.959
Yeah, you could kill people.

01:37.045 --> 01:38.344
I was never bullied.

01:38.379 --> 01:40.596
And to prove that there
are no hard feelings,

01:40.682 --> 01:42.098
I will pick up the check.

01:42.183 --> 01:43.683
How about that, Kevlar?

01:43.718 --> 01:44.934
Ooh, burn!

01:45.019 --> 01:46.886
Hey. Don't call
my brother names.

01:46.971 --> 01:47.937
Apologize.

01:48.022 --> 01:49.439
Okay. Sorry.

01:49.524 --> 01:51.891
I'm sorry about the-the remark
I made about the Kevlar.

01:51.976 --> 01:53.930
The Viper has stung again.

01:54.050 --> 02:01.922

02:02.864 --> 02:03.914
KEVIN: Hey, sweetie.
JENNY: Hey, babe.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.031
KEVIN:
Ready to roll?

02:05.083 --> 02:06.032
Load up.

02:06.118 --> 02:07.033
Oh, no.

02:07.119 --> 02:08.279
Did you have a bad day again?

02:08.287 --> 02:09.919
Yep.
(groans)

02:10.005 --> 02:11.204
Was it that bully again?
What's his name?

02:11.290 --> 02:12.422
Connor or Cooper?

02:12.507 --> 02:13.673
Cooper, Mom.

02:13.709 --> 02:15.342
JENNY: Cooper.
Cooper? Ugh.

02:15.377 --> 02:16.793
He called me a choad juggler.

02:16.878 --> 02:17.877
What?
What?

02:17.930 --> 02:19.796
What did he call you?
(snickers)

02:19.881 --> 02:20.764
(whispering):
Stop.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.132
"Choad juggler."

02:22.217 --> 02:24.601
No... that is...
That...

02:24.686 --> 02:25.885
That's a...
That's wrong.

02:25.971 --> 02:27.637
not funny thing
to say to someone.

02:27.723 --> 02:29.389
Definitely not a funny phrase.

02:29.441 --> 02:30.961
You sure he didn't
say "choad chugger"?

02:31.026 --> 02:33.226
I mean, "chugger" makes
more sense than "juggler,"

02:33.278 --> 02:35.562
although a choad juggler
is more interesting

02:35.647 --> 02:38.648
precisely because it's
unexpected, right? I mean...

02:38.734 --> 02:40.567
Either way, it's not
funny, it's wrong.

02:40.619 --> 02:41.401
Wrong.
Mom, Dad.

02:41.486 --> 02:42.452
What?

02:42.537 --> 02:43.787
Am I a choad juggler?

02:43.872 --> 02:45.956
(Kevin and Jenny snicker)

02:46.041 --> 02:47.123
No. No, you're not.
No.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.993
You're not because
it... they don't exist.

02:50.078 --> 02:51.661
Although Andre could juggle
'em, if anyone could.

02:51.747 --> 02:53.380
He's very deft with his hands.
Stop it.

02:53.415 --> 02:55.048
Does the bullying stop
when you grow up?

02:55.083 --> 02:57.083
Yes. Yes.
Yes. Yes, it does.

02:57.169 --> 02:59.419
Unless you join a
fantasy football league,

02:59.504 --> 03:01.304
and in that case, it's a never-ending
shit... You know what, just stop.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.756
Hi, Kevin.

03:02.808 --> 03:05.175
I have some terrible
news for you.

03:05.260 --> 03:08.094
This week, your team's going
to be as ashamed and beaten down

03:08.180 --> 03:10.730
as, well, you after sex.

03:10.766 --> 03:13.817
I mean, less crying of course,
but defeat is certain.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.769
Ooh, Bama Slamma!

03:15.854 --> 03:17.604
Pete, you are on fire this week.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.939
I know Ruxin makes
a lot of stupid jokes

03:19.992 --> 03:21.192
about us being a couple and...

03:21.193 --> 03:22.242
Yeah, you think?

03:22.277 --> 03:23.610
All I have to say
about that is--

03:23.695 --> 03:26.162
you better get a pun dictionary
and a video camera,

03:26.248 --> 03:28.698
because, Kevin, I'm-a bone you
till I own you, sucka.

03:28.784 --> 03:30.750
Oh, Peter.

03:30.786 --> 03:34.254
I'm-a pound you so hard, balls
deep is gonna be the warm-down.

03:34.289 --> 03:35.455
Man, Pete is
balls deep in Kevin,

03:35.540 --> 03:37.123
and Ruxin's in Puerto Rico.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.458
(laughs, snorts)

03:38.510 --> 03:39.793
Oh, I'm back.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.261
And who would've thunk it?

03:41.296 --> 03:43.129
I had to leave Puerto Rico
to see a cockfight.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.547
You could have seen one there.

03:44.633 --> 03:45.799
<i>Feliz Navidad</i> to me.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.300
Look at all these presents
under the tree.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.351
You know...

03:48.437 --> 03:49.769
(laughs)
Immature.

03:49.805 --> 03:51.471
I'm sorry, what?
Did you say something?

03:51.556 --> 03:53.139
I thought I heard
something brilliant

03:53.191 --> 03:54.774
coming out of your mouth.

03:54.810 --> 03:56.776
Well, what do you got?

03:56.812 --> 03:57.811
What's the matter, Kev?

03:57.863 --> 03:58.978
Pete's ass got your tongue?

03:59.031 --> 04:00.146
Come on, little buddy.

04:00.232 --> 04:01.398
Fine.
PETE: Yeah!

04:01.483 --> 04:02.649
Here, Pete, how about this?

04:02.701 --> 04:03.650
Yeah!

04:03.702 --> 04:04.617
You know what, Pete?

04:04.653 --> 04:06.036
You're a choad juggler.

04:06.121 --> 04:08.655
A living, breathing
choad juggler.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.156
Oh, wow, really?

04:10.242 --> 04:12.282
It's like a circus act,
and you have so many choads,

04:12.294 --> 04:13.793
you have to keep them
in the air.

04:13.829 --> 04:15.245
Oh, my goodness.

04:15.330 --> 04:17.297
Look at all the choads
this guy has.

04:17.332 --> 04:19.666
Oh, look at him go.
(imitates gargling)

04:19.718 --> 04:21.250
And then you light
the choads on fire,

04:21.336 --> 04:23.169
you'll just keep putting them
out in your mouth like...

04:23.221 --> 04:25.055
(imitates gulping)

04:25.140 --> 04:26.556
PETE (laughing):
Oh, Jesus.

04:26.641 --> 04:27.974
Wow.

04:28.009 --> 04:30.343
You'll just be juggling choads
up on the unicycle,

04:30.395 --> 04:31.845
and there'll be on fire,
and you'll be like...

04:31.897 --> 04:32.979
(imitates gulping)

04:33.014 --> 04:34.294
All right, all right, all right.

04:34.349 --> 04:36.015
I got to give it up--
it's a great slam.

04:36.101 --> 04:37.301
This might be slam of the year.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.518
Whoa.

04:38.603 --> 04:40.153
Yeah, it just kind of,
like, rolls off the tongue.

04:40.188 --> 04:42.155
Well, you would be
an expert at that.

04:42.190 --> 04:43.950
Oh, another one from
downtown-- he's on fire.

04:44.025 --> 04:45.492
KEVIN:
Glad you enjoy it.

04:45.527 --> 04:46.826
Just do me a favor and don't use

04:46.862 --> 04:48.161
the phrase "choad juggler"
around the house.

04:48.196 --> 04:49.412
I don't want Ellie hearing it.

04:49.498 --> 04:50.864
Why not? I think
it would be actually one

04:50.916 --> 04:52.332
of the more clean things
she'd hear in that house.

04:52.367 --> 04:53.833
Well, definitely the cleverest.

04:53.869 --> 04:55.869
It's just she's very sensitive
to the whole bullying issue.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.287
Oh, you know what?

04:57.372 --> 04:58.955
Bullying would be a great issue

04:59.040 --> 05:01.000
to focus on at the Little
Eskimo Brothers Program.

05:01.042 --> 05:02.959
You know, I got picked on,
and I fought back.

05:03.044 --> 05:04.928
I just wish Ellie
would do the same.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.293
You don't want her
to fight back.

05:06.348 --> 05:07.547
That's stooping
to their level, okay?

05:07.599 --> 05:09.549
It's a phase, it's gonna pass.

05:09.634 --> 05:11.217
Eh, is it though? I mean,
I feel like in life

05:11.303 --> 05:13.720
you're either a shit-sipper
or a shit-server,

05:13.772 --> 05:16.189
and who you are gets
set very early on.

05:16.224 --> 05:17.724
Yeah, you want to be
serving, not sipping.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.192
Eh, it's not true.

05:19.227 --> 05:22.479
You can sip a little
and serve, like me.

05:22.564 --> 05:24.063
(slurping) Still a little
left-- you can just sip harder.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.698
Mmm, actually, I need a refill.

05:25.734 --> 05:27.414
Oh, we'll always be here
to serve you more.

05:27.486 --> 05:29.402
Well done, keeping 'em coming.
Thank you.

05:29.488 --> 05:30.620
What? What happened?

05:30.705 --> 05:31.738
What?

05:34.209 --> 05:36.075
You used Ellie's bully's insult.

05:36.128 --> 05:37.744
KEVIN: It was there,
I used it, big deal.

05:37.829 --> 05:40.296
You have sunk to the level
of a 12-year-old.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.331
I'm fine with that.

05:41.416 --> 05:42.715
Feels good to own it.

05:42.751 --> 05:44.334
Hey, can I have help
with homework?

05:44.419 --> 05:46.970
Absolutely. What subject
are we talking about?

05:47.055 --> 05:47.921
Sex ed.

05:48.006 --> 05:49.389
Ooh, no, no, no, no.

05:49.424 --> 05:50.390
No...
Get back in there.

05:50.425 --> 05:52.091
You could learn something.

05:52.144 --> 05:54.060
All right, full disclosure,
I'm working

05:54.095 --> 05:55.645
on a third-grade level
in sex ed, so...

05:55.730 --> 05:56.563
That is true.
(gasps)

05:56.598 --> 05:57.981
Oh, my God.

05:58.066 --> 06:01.017
JENNY:
Kevin, will you just try to be

06:01.102 --> 06:02.235
a little more mature.

06:02.270 --> 06:04.521
(laughing, gasps)

06:04.606 --> 06:06.105
(whispering): Looks just like...
Yes, my body.

06:06.191 --> 06:07.524
That looks just like you.

06:07.609 --> 06:09.159
KEVIN: Honey.
JENNY: What is, uh...

06:09.244 --> 06:10.994
what's... what's your question?
What's the question?

06:11.079 --> 06:13.663
If these are the testicles,
Mm-hmm.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.248
and that's the epididymis, Yeah.

06:15.283 --> 06:16.249
then what's that?

06:16.284 --> 06:17.333
Ooh, that's, uh...

06:17.419 --> 06:18.618
Oh, that's Daddy's shaft.
No.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.203
No, it's not, no, that's...

06:20.288 --> 06:21.754
What is it?
That's a...

06:21.790 --> 06:23.089
It's a therapy bill.

06:23.124 --> 06:24.424
Who is this big bone lass?

06:24.459 --> 06:26.960
Kevin, when did you meet
that handsome lady?

06:27.012 --> 06:28.294
On the bus?
ELLIE: Okay, you know what?

06:28.380 --> 06:30.630
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

06:30.715 --> 06:32.098
Maybe by the time I come back,

06:32.133 --> 06:33.349
you two will have
grown up a little.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.468
I mean, I find this
really disturbing.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.937
Kevin, you're standing
just like the guy.

06:37.973 --> 06:40.690
Oh, my God, ugh.

06:40.775 --> 06:41.641
You know what?
It's funny.

06:41.693 --> 06:42.725
It's not funny, okay?

06:42.811 --> 06:44.143
It is.
It's creepy.

06:44.196 --> 06:46.312
I mean, you're talking about
people staring at me naked.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.530
I mean, do you know
what it's like

06:47.616 --> 06:48.896
to be objectified for your body?

06:48.900 --> 06:50.149
No, I have no idea.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.318
I mean, all these children
looking at my nude body.

06:52.404 --> 06:54.537
I don't see how sex offenders
enjoy this at all.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.489
I'm taking this out of this book
No, hey.

06:56.575 --> 06:59.826
I'm ripping it out.
You can't do that, that's school property.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.327
This is my body, all right?

07:01.413 --> 07:02.579
And I'm taking it back.

07:02.664 --> 07:04.797
Unless you want to hold onto it

07:04.833 --> 07:06.666
for whatever extracurricular
activities...

07:06.751 --> 07:07.884
Here he is.
I do not need a page

07:07.969 --> 07:09.085
out of my daughter's sex ed book

07:09.170 --> 07:10.503
for my own erotic pleasure.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.888
You sure?
Yeah.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.389
I am well-versed
in your epididymis, thanks.

07:13.475 --> 07:14.507
I don't even know what that is.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.509
Is there more than one?
What...

07:16.595 --> 07:19.115
It's kind of flattering.
Put a burn mark in there and that's me.

07:20.466 --> 07:21.465
PETE: <i> Yeah, week two</i>
<i>wasn't a total loss.</i>

07:21.501 --> 07:23.134
I mean, I lost in the league,

07:23.169 --> 07:24.668
but I won like $200 on DraftKings.
No, no, no, no.

07:24.754 --> 07:27.133
Nobody wants to hear about
your extracurricular escapades.

07:27.253 --> 07:29.703
Yeah, you're welcome to flaunt
your personal life with us,

07:29.789 --> 07:32.756
but don't flaunt your fantasy
football flings in our faces.

07:32.842 --> 07:34.541
All right, guys, you know what?

07:34.627 --> 07:35.843
I've thought about it.

07:35.878 --> 07:38.595
I may have a few
shit-sipping tendencies,

07:38.681 --> 07:40.014
but all that stops today.

07:40.049 --> 07:41.215
That my sandwich?

07:41.267 --> 07:42.549
Yeah, here it is.

07:42.601 --> 07:43.851
There's only half of it.
Well, you know,

07:43.886 --> 07:45.386
I had a salad, so...

07:45.471 --> 07:46.553
See, this is what
I'm talking about, okay?

07:46.639 --> 07:48.022
I need to be respected

07:48.057 --> 07:49.723
and if you guys can't say
anything nice to me,

07:49.809 --> 07:51.569
then I don't want you
to say anything at all.

07:52.528 --> 07:53.368
(Ruxin clears throat)

07:54.814 --> 07:55.646
ANDRE:
Really?

07:55.731 --> 07:56.697
You guys have nothing to say?

07:56.732 --> 07:58.899
Everything you're thinking of

07:58.951 --> 08:00.617
right now is a hurtful,
nasty thing?

08:02.455 --> 08:03.237
ANDRE:
Oh, come on!

08:03.322 --> 08:04.405
All right, you know what? Fine.

08:04.490 --> 08:05.706
I will lead the conversation.

08:05.741 --> 08:06.990
So yesterday,
I took a hot yoga class,

08:07.076 --> 08:09.293
but I'm very tense
in the pelvis region.

08:09.378 --> 08:11.078
The teacher was telling me

08:11.130 --> 08:12.463
that I needed to release it.

08:12.548 --> 08:13.664
So... I don't know
how to do that myself,

08:13.749 --> 08:14.965
and I asked him for some help.

08:15.051 --> 08:16.166
He put me up
in front of the class

08:16.252 --> 08:17.167
and put his hands
right above my pelvis.

08:17.253 --> 08:18.752
And he said, "Oh, my God,

08:18.804 --> 08:19.887
you're so tight here."

08:19.922 --> 08:21.672
So he just started
pushing and massaging

08:21.757 --> 08:22.673
and then, boom!

08:22.758 --> 08:24.758
All that pressure just releases.

08:24.844 --> 08:26.727
I felt unbelievable.

08:26.762 --> 08:28.595
People in the class were coming
up to me at the end going like,

08:28.681 --> 08:31.065
"I can't believe you..."
Guys!

08:31.100 --> 08:32.580
Oh, Taco!
Thank God you're here, Taco.

08:32.601 --> 08:33.900
You're never gonna believe
what I found.

08:33.936 --> 08:35.402
My brother Kevin

08:35.438 --> 08:37.404
is in a book.
KEVIN: No, no, no, no.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.405
Wow!
Give that to me.

08:38.441 --> 08:39.405
No, I'm not!

08:39.442 --> 08:40.774
Where did you get that?

08:40.860 --> 08:42.241
Hey, if you don't want
me to find something,

08:42.278 --> 08:43.360
don't leave it
just sitting there

08:43.446 --> 08:44.611
in the middle of the garbage.

08:44.697 --> 08:45.779
Kevin, it looks just like you.

08:45.831 --> 08:46.580
I mean, it doesn't have
the gray pubes,

08:46.615 --> 08:47.614
but it's close.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.366
And the artist was very generous

08:49.452 --> 08:50.951
in the crotchal region.

08:51.036 --> 08:52.476
Oh, this is actually
great for Ellie,

08:52.505 --> 08:53.954
because she can literally see
where she came from.

08:54.039 --> 08:55.089
Very funny.

08:55.124 --> 08:57.007
It is not me,
but it did freak me out,

08:57.093 --> 08:58.459
so I tore it out
of Ellie's sex ed book

08:58.544 --> 09:00.010
to throw in the garbage.

09:00.096 --> 09:01.462
I wish I could be in class

09:01.547 --> 09:02.796
to hear the teacher
try to explain it.

09:02.848 --> 09:04.631
Like... "The Kevin,

09:04.717 --> 09:06.300
"while having sex
with his spouse,

09:06.352 --> 09:08.135
thinks about his best friend,
The Pete."

09:08.220 --> 09:09.136
Okay.

09:09.221 --> 09:10.604
Oh, really, really funny.

09:10.639 --> 09:12.639
Real mature, coming
from a bunch of choad jugglers.

09:12.725 --> 09:14.975
What's that, now?
Choad jugglers. You're choad jugglers.

09:15.060 --> 09:16.727
Not really landing
like it used to.

09:16.812 --> 09:18.312
It's starting to lose its steam.

09:18.397 --> 09:19.980
I don't think so. I think it burns, still.
Yeah, no, no.

09:20.032 --> 09:20.981
Take it from the Viper.

09:21.066 --> 09:22.566
You need a new hook, Kevlar.

09:22.651 --> 09:24.701
I got plenty of new stuff,
so don't worry about me, okay?

09:24.787 --> 09:26.348
Oh, great. Let's hear it.
We're excited.

09:26.405 --> 09:27.738
What do you got?

09:27.823 --> 09:29.823
I'm... I'm workshopping it
still, so...

09:29.875 --> 09:31.625
when it's ready to be heard,

09:31.660 --> 09:33.210
you will then feel the burn.

09:33.295 --> 09:34.628
What, do you have, like,
a lamer group of friends

09:34.663 --> 09:35.963
that you open mic with?

09:35.998 --> 09:37.631
I gotta say,
this artist is great.

09:37.666 --> 09:39.249
Really impressed by his use

09:39.335 --> 09:41.135
of the three pillars
of genital drawings:

09:41.170 --> 09:42.803
scale, perspective
and dick shading.

09:42.838 --> 09:44.221
Wow.

09:44.306 --> 09:45.756
I find it really disturbing

09:45.841 --> 09:47.341
that you're interested in a
picture of your naked brother.

09:47.426 --> 09:48.976
Get your mind out of the gutter.

09:49.011 --> 09:50.511
The only reason I'm interested

09:50.596 --> 09:52.980
is because I draw my own porn
to masturbate to.

09:53.015 --> 09:53.814
KEVIN: What?
Really?

09:53.849 --> 09:55.149
Why?

09:55.184 --> 09:57.351
I'm a DIY kind of guy.

09:57.436 --> 09:59.269
Taco, masturbation is DIY.

09:59.355 --> 10:01.522
Yeah, well, I've been having
a rough time lately.

10:01.574 --> 10:03.574
If I spend the whole day
drawing a picture,

10:03.659 --> 10:05.492
it kind of takes the element
of surprise out of it.

10:05.528 --> 10:07.528
I'm thinking of bringing in
another artist

10:07.613 --> 10:08.695
to spice things up.

10:08.781 --> 10:09.780
Andre?

10:09.865 --> 10:11.365
Want to draw some porn with me?

10:11.450 --> 10:13.667
Enough of your insults.
No, thank you.

10:13.702 --> 10:15.202
I think he actually wants
to draw porn with you.

10:15.287 --> 10:16.370
Ooh, I'd love to.

10:16.455 --> 10:18.038
Of course you would,
you dumb piss-juggler.

10:18.123 --> 10:19.206
Hmm?
What?

10:19.258 --> 10:20.424
Piss-juggler.

10:20.509 --> 10:22.042
This guy.
Juggling piss.

10:22.094 --> 10:23.343
How do you juggle a liquid?

10:23.379 --> 10:25.212
It's, you know...
Ay-ay-ay.

10:25.297 --> 10:26.380
...in canisters and he...

10:26.432 --> 10:27.548
PETE:
You just changed one word.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.633
You just replaced "choad"
with "piss."

10:29.718 --> 10:31.385
Bah, you don't...

10:31.470 --> 10:32.386
you don't know what...

10:32.471 --> 10:33.854
I said.

10:33.889 --> 10:35.889
(knock on door)
KEVIN: <i> Hey, sweetie?</i>

10:35.975 --> 10:37.891
How's homework going?
Not so great.

10:37.943 --> 10:39.977
Some jerk tore the page
out of my health textbook.

10:40.062 --> 10:40.944
What?

10:41.030 --> 10:42.396
Oh, my goodness.

10:42.481 --> 10:44.114
These kids! Damn it!

10:44.200 --> 10:45.315
I don't know how
I'm going to finish

10:45.401 --> 10:46.617
this presentation without it.

10:46.702 --> 10:47.901
Oh, rough stuff.

10:47.953 --> 10:49.403
Anyway, I came to talk
about the bullying.

10:49.488 --> 10:51.738
Okay, you know that if that
bully calls you anything,

10:51.790 --> 10:53.240
you can tell me, right?
Yeah.

10:53.292 --> 10:54.992
Has he said anything else,
recently?

10:55.077 --> 10:57.244
Uh, yesterday he called me
"Buttly."

10:57.329 --> 10:58.245
Buttly?

10:58.330 --> 11:00.080
Buttly.

11:00.165 --> 11:01.965
"Buttly" doesn't... doesn't
really roll off the tongue.

11:02.051 --> 11:03.217
Buttly...

11:03.252 --> 11:04.918
The other kids were laughing.

11:04.970 --> 11:06.420
Oh, yeah, but those kids
are animals.

11:06.472 --> 11:07.754
They'll laugh at anything.

11:07.806 --> 11:10.057
I doubt it would please
a more discerning audience.

11:10.092 --> 11:11.292
"Buttly" is just lazy, really,

11:11.310 --> 11:12.593
when you think about it.

11:12.645 --> 11:14.094
It's just adding "-ly"

11:14.146 --> 11:15.512
on top of a body part.

11:15.598 --> 11:16.897
How about "footly"?
You have big feet. Footly...

11:16.932 --> 11:18.565
Okay, Dad, I don't want
to talk about the bully.

11:18.601 --> 11:20.267
No, I know, he's mean.

11:20.352 --> 11:22.769
And very uneven, creatively.

11:22.821 --> 11:25.188
Okay, I really need help
with my sex ed homework.

11:25.274 --> 11:26.273
I hear you.

11:26.325 --> 11:27.941
Listen, if he
calls you anything,

11:27.993 --> 11:29.610
you let me know, okay?

11:29.695 --> 11:31.078
In fact, write it down.

11:31.113 --> 11:32.446
Sound it out if you don't
know how to spell it.

11:32.498 --> 11:33.113
Okay, Dad.

11:33.165 --> 11:34.448
Get it done.

11:34.533 --> 11:35.532
Thanks for the help.

11:35.618 --> 11:36.533
Good talk, baby.

11:36.619 --> 11:37.784
I love you so much.

11:37.870 --> 11:40.037
This kid shows a lot of promise.

11:40.122 --> 11:42.339
Man, I would love to be
a Big Eskimo Brother.

11:42.424 --> 11:44.207
Sorry. In order to be
a Big Eskimo Brother,

11:44.293 --> 11:46.426
you have to be having sex
at the EBDBBnB.

11:46.462 --> 11:47.928
If not, it's just creepy.

11:47.963 --> 11:49.429
Yeah, but I'm a pretty
good role model.

11:49.465 --> 11:50.797
I mean, I could help the kids,
you know.

11:50.849 --> 11:52.299
Three monogamous relationships

11:52.384 --> 11:53.717
is hardly a role model, Andre.

11:53.802 --> 11:55.135
Check the facts.
Three and a half.

11:55.187 --> 11:56.019
KEVIN:
Whoa. What are you doing

11:56.105 --> 11:57.137
with all these pictures of boys?

11:57.222 --> 11:58.889
These are my
Little Eskimo Brothers.

11:58.974 --> 12:00.190
Wait, this is Cooper Harris.

12:00.276 --> 12:02.059
This is Ellie's bully.

12:02.144 --> 12:03.393
Cooper. Good kid.

12:03.479 --> 12:04.811
What a small world.

12:04.897 --> 12:06.313
I thought you set up this
whole Taco Cares program

12:06.398 --> 12:07.614
to focus on bullying.
Exactly.

12:07.650 --> 12:10.200
I'm recruiting young bullies
from the community

12:10.286 --> 12:12.152
and giving them
the tools and structure

12:12.204 --> 12:13.320
to thrive in the world.

12:13.405 --> 12:14.821
Wait, you're helping bullies.

12:14.907 --> 12:16.657
Yeah. If I don't,
who will?

12:16.709 --> 12:18.469
Everyone's always
looking after the underdog,

12:18.494 --> 12:21.128
but who is looking after
the overdog?

12:21.163 --> 12:23.246
No one, because an overdog
isn't a thing.

12:23.332 --> 12:24.498
It's just a dog.

12:24.583 --> 12:25.716
These are children
you're talking about.

12:25.801 --> 12:27.134
They're getting
kicked out of parks,

12:27.169 --> 12:28.409
they're getting kicked offline.

12:28.420 --> 12:30.003
The EBDBBnB is a sanctuary

12:30.089 --> 12:31.672
for these young children.

12:31.724 --> 12:33.974
They don't need sanctuary;
they need psychiatric help.

12:34.009 --> 12:36.310
I was bullied as a child
and look at me today.

12:36.345 --> 12:37.928
I'm the successful CEO

12:38.013 --> 12:39.680
of a multi-dollar corporation.

12:39.765 --> 12:41.632
You can't really argue with that.
Yeah.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:50.585 --> 12:52.991
TACO: Ah! Welcome
to the EBDBBnB.

12:53.101 --> 12:54.550
After the "P" goes in the "V,"

12:54.602 --> 12:56.519
give back to the community.

12:56.554 --> 12:57.520
What are you doing?

12:57.555 --> 12:58.888
There's kids around here.

12:58.940 --> 13:00.723
Can I serve you a cold beverage, sir?
No.

13:00.808 --> 13:02.275
Riley!
(snaps fingers)

13:02.360 --> 13:03.559
I truly don't
need a drink, Taco.

13:03.611 --> 13:04.894
You're... oh.

13:04.979 --> 13:06.362
No, I don't want them anymore.

13:06.397 --> 13:07.396
It took too long.

13:07.448 --> 13:09.148
Hey! The grown-ups
are talking!

13:09.234 --> 13:10.616
Stop the lawn mower.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.451
Just cut it with
your fingers for a bit.

13:12.537 --> 13:13.870
TACO:
Hey. Scrub that tree.

13:13.905 --> 13:15.454
Want to be able
to see my face in it.

13:15.540 --> 13:16.572
Without the attitude.

13:16.658 --> 13:17.990
Okay?

13:18.076 --> 13:19.242
I just want to speak to
Cooper Harris, if I can.

13:19.294 --> 13:21.095
I like Cooper.
He's the only one of these kids

13:21.162 --> 13:22.962
that's not a huge loser.

13:23.047 --> 13:24.797
Sorry, but you know it's true.

13:24.883 --> 13:26.082
Come on.

13:26.167 --> 13:27.327
Follow me.
You're not a loser.

13:27.335 --> 13:28.467
Come on, vacuum that grass.

13:28.553 --> 13:29.914
I want to be able
to eat off of it.

13:29.921 --> 13:31.671
Who's got the chainsaw?

13:31.756 --> 13:33.389
Come on, that tree's not
gonna cut itself down.

13:33.424 --> 13:34.590
No, no! Don't touch
the chainsaw!

13:34.676 --> 13:35.758
(chainsaw revving)
You. Up the ladder.

13:35.843 --> 13:37.093
Hurry up. What are you, a baby?

13:37.178 --> 13:38.427
You-you are a baby.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.930
Don't go up the ladder.
Oh, my God, Taco!

13:40.982 --> 13:42.899
ANDRE: <i>You know, it was a really
smart move on your dad's part</i>

13:42.934 --> 13:44.984
to bring in a doctor to help
you with this sex ed stuff.

13:45.069 --> 13:46.402
Yeah, he's been really weird
about it.

13:46.437 --> 13:48.271
I mean, all I have to do
is write a report.

13:48.356 --> 13:49.322
Don't worry about it.

13:49.407 --> 13:50.523
We're not gonna just sit around

13:50.608 --> 13:51.908
and talk about sex all day long

13:51.943 --> 13:52.983
like a bunch of Samanthas.

13:53.027 --> 13:54.527
I don't get it.

13:54.612 --> 13:56.078
Of course you don't, you know?

13:56.114 --> 13:58.447
Your mind's not
on this planet right now.

13:58.533 --> 13:59.749
You're being bullied,
you're being picked on.

13:59.784 --> 14:01.167
Let me tell you something.

14:01.287 --> 14:03.047
There are two types
of people in this world.

14:03.167 --> 14:04.443
Feces-sippers

14:04.705 --> 14:06.150
and feces-servers.

14:06.270 --> 14:07.470
You know, when I was your age,

14:07.566 --> 14:10.051
I, sipped a wee bit
of the feces.

14:10.171 --> 14:11.172
You still chugging it?

14:11.292 --> 14:12.367
I didn't chug it, okay?

14:12.487 --> 14:13.526
I sipped it.

14:13.646 --> 14:14.930
And you're sipping it, too,

14:15.050 --> 14:16.612
so don't be
all high and mighty, okay?

14:16.732 --> 14:18.705
We need you to start
serving the feces.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.754
'Cause I don't want you
picked on like I was.

14:20.874 --> 14:22.710
I mean, even your dad
used to pick on me.

14:22.830 --> 14:23.556
He <i> used</i> to?

14:23.641 --> 14:25.057
Just last night
he called you sad.

14:25.143 --> 14:27.560
Well, that means
something different to adults.

14:27.645 --> 14:29.895
Well, whatever it means,
you're a super version of it.

14:29.981 --> 14:30.896
Well, I'm gonna focus
on the super part,

14:30.982 --> 14:32.281
not the second part.

14:32.317 --> 14:33.616
They say that they'd rather
not watch football

14:33.651 --> 14:34.817
than go to Andre's.

14:34.869 --> 14:36.152
You're so smart,
you think that's me?

14:36.204 --> 14:37.954
No, that's a restaurant
downtown.

14:37.989 --> 14:39.956
If you ever got out
and had a life,

14:39.991 --> 14:41.157
you would realize that.

14:41.242 --> 14:43.159
Okay, well,
they really hate it there.

14:43.244 --> 14:45.494
Oh, yeah, well, you know what?
I mean, they say the owner

14:45.546 --> 14:46.796
has terrible taste
and he's color-blind.

14:46.831 --> 14:48.214
He's really ugly and old.
Okay, you know what?

14:48.299 --> 14:50.049
Let me tell you something,
you are being picked on,

14:50.134 --> 14:52.418
and so am I,
and we need to fight back.

14:52.503 --> 14:54.503
What we're gonna do is
we're gonna serve up some feces.

14:54.589 --> 14:55.950
And next time someone
picks on you,

14:55.974 --> 14:57.673
you need to look them right
in the eye and be like,

14:57.725 --> 15:00.726
"What's that,
you big choad juggler?"

15:00.812 --> 15:02.094
What?
I know.

15:02.180 --> 15:03.346
Your dad said it's not,
like, appropriate for you,

15:03.398 --> 15:04.647
but I actually think
you can handle it.

15:04.682 --> 15:06.482
It's funny, right?
That's not funny.

15:06.517 --> 15:07.433
No, it's hilarious.

15:07.518 --> 15:08.818
Everyone's gonna laugh.

15:08.853 --> 15:09.685
You'll be like, "choad juggler,
choad juggler."

15:09.771 --> 15:10.603
Andre, I mean it.

15:10.688 --> 15:12.521
Stop calling me that!

15:12.607 --> 15:13.689
(groans)
And don't you ever

15:13.775 --> 15:14.991
call me that again.

15:15.026 --> 15:16.359
Ever.
(groans)

15:16.411 --> 15:17.943
Way to fight back, Ellie.

15:18.029 --> 15:20.196
Andre, you just got decked
like Geno Smith.

15:20.281 --> 15:23.332
I'm gonna be out
for six to ten week.

15:23.368 --> 15:25.868
TACO:
<i>Hey, Cooper, what's going on?</i>

15:25.920 --> 15:27.703
Why'd you give up
on the leaf blower?

15:27.755 --> 15:29.705
'Cause there's
no more leaves, Taco.

15:29.757 --> 15:31.841
Stop complaining. If there are
no more leaves on the ground,

15:31.876 --> 15:33.342
you pull them off
the tree, okay?

15:33.378 --> 15:36.712
Hey, I need four volunteers
to help me bury a dead animal.

15:36.764 --> 15:38.431
Let's go.
Hey, Cooper.

15:38.516 --> 15:40.383
I'm Ellie's father. I'd like
a word with you, please.

15:40.435 --> 15:43.386
Oh, you're that
choad juggler's dad?

15:43.471 --> 15:45.391
Hey, you need to stop
calling her that right now.

15:45.473 --> 15:47.056
First of all, it's
very hurtful to her.

15:47.108 --> 15:48.140
And secondly,

15:48.226 --> 15:49.308
it's getting a little old.

15:49.394 --> 15:50.443
All right, that's one gutter.

15:50.528 --> 15:51.861
Now move on to the next one,

15:51.896 --> 15:53.017
the one with the wasps nest.

15:53.064 --> 15:53.979
Hurry up.

15:54.065 --> 15:55.114
Uncle Taco, I need your help.

15:55.199 --> 15:56.232
What's wrong, Ellie?

15:56.284 --> 15:57.533
You seem upset.

15:57.568 --> 15:58.784
Did you get fired from your job
or something?

15:58.870 --> 16:00.486
Worse. My dad's bullying me.

16:00.571 --> 16:02.571
Ellie,
whatever your father said,

16:02.657 --> 16:04.990
I'm sure he meant to say it
behind your back.

16:05.076 --> 16:06.242
And my parents won't help me

16:06.327 --> 16:07.493
with my health
class presentation.

16:07.578 --> 16:08.544
It's due soon.

16:08.579 --> 16:10.212
I lost the diagram.

16:10.248 --> 16:12.248
I don't know where to start.
The Kevin diagram?

16:12.333 --> 16:13.466
Yeah.
Oh.

16:13.551 --> 16:15.251
You've come to the right place,
my dear.

16:15.303 --> 16:16.752
You can help me?
Absolutely.

16:16.838 --> 16:18.003
Follow me.

16:18.089 --> 16:19.305
My God, thank you so much.

16:19.390 --> 16:21.057
Hey, vacuum this dirt.

16:21.092 --> 16:22.224
It's disgusting.

16:22.260 --> 16:23.309
Come on.

16:25.096 --> 16:26.228
Daniel, when you're done
with the bathroom,

16:26.264 --> 16:28.564
I want you to clean the fruit.

16:28.599 --> 16:30.182
Jimmy, while we're gone,
I want you to rearrange

16:30.268 --> 16:32.435
everything in this room
in a fun and surprising way.

16:32.487 --> 16:33.686
Thank you.

16:35.490 --> 16:37.189
If you want to say anything
to Ellie in the future,

16:37.275 --> 16:38.715
I want you to say
it to me right now,

16:38.776 --> 16:42.411
especially if it's scatological
or pun-based with a body part.

16:42.447 --> 16:43.863
So come on. Hit me
with it. Let's hear it.

16:43.948 --> 16:45.498
Come on.
Okay, Buttly.

16:45.583 --> 16:47.416
Is that your attempt at humor?

16:47.452 --> 16:49.452
It's funny.
I'm not laughing.

16:49.504 --> 16:51.670
Are you laughing? Baby
Ray Romano's not laughing.

16:51.756 --> 16:53.539
Come on, man.
You're supposed to be the best.

16:53.624 --> 16:56.292
That's all you have, "Buttly"?
I was coming off a detention.

16:56.344 --> 16:58.878
And I have a nightmare load
of homework.

16:58.963 --> 17:02.965
- And my dog is sick. - I see your ability
to come up with excuses still works well.

17:03.017 --> 17:05.184
Now, I could explain sex
ed to you all day long,

17:05.269 --> 17:09.137
but a picture is worth
a thousand positions.

17:09.223 --> 17:11.473
Welcome to my studio.
Well, this isn't

17:11.526 --> 17:13.526
creepy at all.
What a relief.

17:13.611 --> 17:15.644
I was worried
you wouldn't like it.

17:15.695 --> 17:19.198
Oh, I'm sorry. This is...
inappropriate for a child.

17:19.282 --> 17:20.950
Much better.

17:20.984 --> 17:22.651
I call this
one "H..."

17:22.703 --> 17:24.653
Nothing.

17:24.739 --> 17:27.490
I've been studying your father's
naked body for a while.

17:27.541 --> 17:29.658
He has
some really interesting angles.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.327
Still haven't mastered
that lilt yet.

17:31.379 --> 17:33.412
It's really tricky.

17:33.498 --> 17:35.131
All right, let's get to
work on this presentation.

17:35.166 --> 17:38.667
Your dad's groinal area
is not gonna draw itself.

17:38.719 --> 17:39.969
Now, what kind of scenario

17:40.004 --> 17:41.720
do you want? You want,
like, a hot tub,

17:41.806 --> 17:44.340
a pizza delivery-type thing?
Is that...

17:44.425 --> 17:46.008
is that my dad?

17:46.093 --> 17:47.843
How 'bout, uh,
"Museum of Fine Farts"?

17:47.929 --> 17:49.595
"Museum of Fine
Farts." That's good.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.680
But good is the enemy of great.
Okay.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.166
So let's dig deeper.
We can beat it.

17:53.184 --> 17:55.684
Yeah, that's your dad with
his new Little Eskimo Brother.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.269
That's my bully!

17:57.355 --> 17:59.605
He's with my bully!
Ooh, that's rough.

17:59.690 --> 18:02.024
Listen, Ellie, if ever you need
to talk about this

18:02.109 --> 18:04.660
to anyone, I'd
bottle it up instead.

18:04.695 --> 18:06.296
No one wants to hear
about your problems.

18:06.330 --> 18:07.496
I'm gonna kill him!

18:07.532 --> 18:09.698
How 'bout
"Feces Peanut Butter Cups"?

18:09.750 --> 18:11.700
(chuckles)
We could do better.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.085
Yeah, but you laughed.

18:13.171 --> 18:14.837
But did I laugh the right kind
of laugh?

18:14.872 --> 18:16.455
Well, what do you got,
Old Man Ginger?

18:16.541 --> 18:17.957
Hey, look who's talkin'.

18:18.042 --> 18:19.625
Yeah, what do you got?
Well, I... Look, I mean, I figure

18:19.710 --> 18:21.377
we should stay in the world
of juggling, all right?

18:21.462 --> 18:23.629
- Let's just see what other
gold is in those hills. - Dad?

18:23.714 --> 18:25.714
What are you doing?!

18:25.800 --> 18:28.467
Oh, my God, Ellie, this is not
what it looks like, I promise.

18:28.553 --> 18:32.555
Busted. (chuckles)
You will pay for this, Daddy. You will pay!

18:32.640 --> 18:34.996
Keep 'em coming, kid.
All right, I'll e-mail you.

18:35.116 --> 18:38.971
Ah, another family-enriching day
at the EBDBBnB.

18:39.091 --> 18:40.613
Get to work!

18:45.767 --> 18:47.987
KEVIN: <i>Ms. Pam, we wanted to apologize
for missing the fund-raiser.</i>

18:48.214 --> 18:49.997
Something...
It was awful.

18:50.082 --> 18:51.799
Something awful...
...tragic happened.

18:51.884 --> 18:54.635
I will pass along
your <i> very</i> general apologies

18:54.720 --> 18:58.055
to the booster club, but
that's not why we're here today.

18:58.090 --> 19:00.758
The class gave sex ed
presentations, and Ellie's

19:00.810 --> 19:03.260
was very interesting.

19:03.312 --> 19:04.845
Did either of you
help her with it?

19:04.930 --> 19:07.147
No. No. God, no.
Uh...

19:07.233 --> 19:09.516
Unless we were supposed to help her.
Were we... were we supposed to help her?

19:09.602 --> 19:11.602
'Cause I think we did then.
You know what we did? We supervised,

19:11.687 --> 19:13.488
but the work was all hers.
That's what we did.

19:13.489 --> 19:14.905
Then that's
even more disturbing.

19:14.940 --> 19:17.825
"Human Sexuality
by Ellie MacArthur.

19:17.910 --> 19:19.860
Nice.
"Sex between

19:19.945 --> 19:22.946
consenting adults comes
in many forms and varieties."

19:22.998 --> 19:24.079
I see no problem with that.

19:24.083 --> 19:24.832
Just wait.
Okay.

19:24.917 --> 19:26.617
(gasps)
Oh.

19:26.702 --> 19:29.036
"There's sex
between a man and woman."

19:29.121 --> 19:30.087
Did you do this?

19:30.122 --> 19:32.506
No. Taco did this.
Is that me?

19:32.591 --> 19:34.374
No, I think that's the
big-boned lass from the bus.

19:34.460 --> 19:36.427
PAM:
This is unacceptable.

19:36.462 --> 19:38.929
Ellie has
a very vivid imagination.

19:38.964 --> 19:40.547
Actually, she does not.

19:40.633 --> 19:41.682
I've seen her in class.

19:41.767 --> 19:44.435
I find her to be underwhelming.

19:44.470 --> 19:45.769
Her nickname is "Simply There."

19:45.805 --> 19:47.471
She has a dark energy
around her.

19:47.523 --> 19:49.807
Nothing going on
behind the eyes.

19:49.892 --> 19:51.859
And I find her to be very dull.

19:51.944 --> 19:55.145
Dull, dull, dull.
(gasps)

19:55.197 --> 19:55.979
Oh, my God.

19:56.065 --> 19:57.281
Oh, boy.
"And intercourse

19:57.316 --> 19:58.866
between a man and man."

19:58.951 --> 20:01.452
Oh, wow. Oh!

20:01.487 --> 20:02.536
Pete!
I suspected

20:02.621 --> 20:04.321
this was one
of your ex-boyfriends.

20:04.406 --> 20:06.073
"Ex"? No.
We're still best friends.

20:06.158 --> 20:07.124
We talk every day.

20:07.159 --> 20:07.825
(clears throat)
Kevin.

20:07.877 --> 20:09.827
"Be smart about sex!"

20:09.912 --> 20:10.872
That's beautiful.
It ends

20:10.913 --> 20:11.829
on a high note.
Look at that

20:11.881 --> 20:13.380
rainbow.
Are those...

20:13.466 --> 20:14.587
choads?
Yes, they are choads,

20:14.633 --> 20:16.834
and your husband
is juggling them.

20:16.919 --> 20:18.418
What you're showing me here
is science fiction.

20:18.504 --> 20:20.464
I don't know anyone that juggles choads.
I've seen

20:20.473 --> 20:22.673
two criminally insane people
juggle choads.

20:22.758 --> 20:26.176
I can promise you, ma'am,
it's not a laughing matter.

20:26.228 --> 20:27.644
I am not a choad juggler.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.229
The book tells a different tale.

20:29.315 --> 20:30.681
Well, Ellie made it up, okay?

20:30.766 --> 20:32.683
Your child does not have
the mental capacity

20:32.768 --> 20:35.602
to make things up.
She is a dullard.

20:35.688 --> 20:37.988
I don't even... Is that a real
word? What does that mean?

20:38.023 --> 20:39.490
That's the first time
I've ever heard that word.

20:39.525 --> 20:41.216
This is so much worse
than my last job.
