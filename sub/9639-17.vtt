WEBVTT

00:04.791 --> 00:06.884
Okay. Last question.

00:07.160 --> 00:11.494
''Bat wings, dragon scales and fruit punch
make what kind of potion?

00:11.631 --> 00:17.001
A, invisibility. B, skin of steel.
C, a refreshing fruit smoothie.''

00:17.303 --> 00:18.531
Got it.

00:18.671 --> 00:20.639
Does he have to say ''got it''
after every question?

00:20.773 --> 00:22.638
lt's throwing me off on my exam.

00:24.310 --> 00:26.141
We're taking an exam?

00:28.615 --> 00:31.413
Time. Pencils down.
Last exam section.

00:31.551 --> 00:33.075
Grab your wands and line up.

00:33.219 --> 00:35.346
You have to use
the transfiguration spell

00:35.488 --> 00:38.821
to change one of these guinea pigs
into a white dove.

00:38.958 --> 00:41.722
Okay, Justin, you're up.

00:42.762 --> 00:47.461
This guinea pig is now not
A dove with wings should fill its slot

00:48.501 --> 00:49.991
Very good, Justin.

00:50.470 --> 00:53.439
- Alex, you're up.
- Oh, okay.

00:54.807 --> 00:58.868
This guinea pig is now not
A dove with wings should fill its slot

01:03.249 --> 01:06.377
lt's a pretty dove.

01:06.953 --> 01:10.480
No. lt's a pretty brick.

01:11.557 --> 01:14.993
You weren't concentrating.
Max, you're up.

01:17.497 --> 01:22.127
This guinea pig is now not
A dove with wings should fill with snot

01:25.171 --> 01:27.537
l said ''snot,'' didn't l?

01:28.708 --> 01:31.506
Okay, everybody record
your transfiguration results

01:31.644 --> 01:34.613
in your midterm-exam text booklets.

01:36.416 --> 01:38.577
l don't know why you guys
even bother taking the tests.

01:38.718 --> 01:41.312
We all know l'm the one that's gonna win
the family wizard contest

01:41.454 --> 01:42.944
and keep my powers.

01:43.089 --> 01:44.852
That's not for a long while, Justin.

01:44.991 --> 01:48.017
And what if they change the rules
so only girls keep their powers?

01:48.161 --> 01:50.789
Oh, wait, you still might win.

01:51.331 --> 01:54.562
Oh, Alex, you're so transparent. You know
that l'm better than you at magic,

01:54.701 --> 01:56.464
so you have to lash out
and make fun of me.

01:56.602 --> 01:58.593
And you don't take
any of this magic seriously.

01:58.738 --> 02:01.901
l can't take you seriously.
You use big words like ''transparent.''

02:02.041 --> 02:03.633
What are you, British?

02:06.212 --> 02:08.145
No, but l am.

02:09.414 --> 02:12.179
Professor Crumbs,
always nice to see you.

02:12.318 --> 02:14.309
The beard is coming in nicely.

02:15.388 --> 02:16.753
Jerry.

02:16.889 --> 02:19.050
l knew your father when this

02:19.192 --> 02:22.923
was just a soul patch
for the lovely witches.

02:26.432 --> 02:30.869
l am here to collect your exams
and take them back to Wiz Tech.

02:32.338 --> 02:34.101
Why doesn't Dad
just grade our papers?

02:34.240 --> 02:35.935
So that no one will get better grades

02:36.075 --> 02:39.169
just by batting their eyes
and trying to look cute.

02:40.179 --> 02:42.443
Are you talking about me?

02:43.616 --> 02:45.846
Alex, you're doing it right now.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:41.974 --> 03:43.202
Wizard report cards are here.

03:44.277 --> 03:47.474
Oh, you sound excited.
You must feel confident you did well.

03:49.282 --> 03:51.773
Wizard report cards are here.

03:53.719 --> 03:54.777
You first.

04:00.193 --> 04:02.286
Max Russo, your exam results

04:02.562 --> 04:05.463
plus your coursework
equals a solid C-plus.

04:05.598 --> 04:08.999
You are totally average. Cool.

04:11.304 --> 04:15.240
Sweet, l got a C. Yes.

04:19.579 --> 04:22.946
Alex Russo, your exam results
plus the homework you handed in

04:23.082 --> 04:25.448
on greasy napkins
that smelled like shrimp

04:25.585 --> 04:28.452
all equals...F.

04:28.754 --> 04:31.621
And the...is a low F.

04:32.258 --> 04:33.725
Excuse me.

04:33.860 --> 04:35.885
l turned a guinea pig
into a very solid brick,

04:36.028 --> 04:39.896
which l think is a much more effective
symbol for peace.

04:40.266 --> 04:41.790
Please have your parents sign me,

04:41.934 --> 04:44.960
so l can return to Wizard Tech
and receive my payment.

04:45.104 --> 04:46.571
l have to make a living.

04:47.707 --> 04:51.541
- Yeah, right, like that's gonna happen.
- No, no, no.

04:51.677 --> 04:53.736
l got children to laminate.

04:54.413 --> 04:56.608
What are you gonna do?
Mom and Dad need to sign that.

04:56.949 --> 04:59.383
Well, they can't sign something
that never got here.

04:59.652 --> 05:01.017
- But it got here.
- No, it didn't.

05:01.153 --> 05:02.677
- Yes, it did. No, it didn't.
- lt did.

05:02.822 --> 05:04.187
- What?
- l don't know.

05:04.323 --> 05:05.722
Perfect.

05:07.593 --> 05:09.959
Oh, the report cards are here.

05:10.096 --> 05:11.757
l gotta make a copy for my new frame.

05:18.638 --> 05:21.971
Justin Russo,
your exam results plus your coursework

05:22.108 --> 05:26.374
equals all As
and one B-plus in rhyming charms.

05:26.512 --> 05:28.412
You're the smart one.

05:28.915 --> 05:31.816
B-plus? l can't put this in the frame.

05:33.319 --> 05:34.377
What a shame.

05:34.520 --> 05:38.012
See, l got game. This grade is lame.

05:38.157 --> 05:40.455
Oh, l got a good rhyme. Corn.

05:40.593 --> 05:41.992
And?

05:42.762 --> 05:44.696
l panicked.

05:52.104 --> 05:57.235
Oh, l love it in there.
lt smells like popcorn.

05:59.078 --> 06:01.205
Why don't you hush?
l thought l threw you away.

06:01.347 --> 06:04.441
You can't throw me away.
l need a parent to sign me.

06:04.584 --> 06:08.543
And preferably with a nice soft-tip pen.

06:09.589 --> 06:11.716
See you later, honey.
l'll be back in an hour.

06:15.695 --> 06:16.855
Going for a jog.

06:18.097 --> 06:19.496
Are you doing the dishes?

06:21.634 --> 06:23.602
Yeah, sure.

06:25.972 --> 06:28.406
l know what you're doing.
You're afraid of what's gonna happen

06:28.541 --> 06:31.203
when your report card gets here,
so you're trying to be extra good.

06:31.577 --> 06:33.875
Yep. You always know
what l'm up to, Dad.

06:40.086 --> 06:41.610
l'm back.

06:44.290 --> 06:46.053
Oh, yeah?
Well, let's see if you keep talking

06:46.192 --> 06:48.217
when you're full of hot sauce.

06:48.361 --> 06:49.953
That is hot.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.500
You know what? l feel bad for you.

06:56.636 --> 06:59.730
l'm going to tell you
how to get rid of a bad report card.

06:59.872 --> 07:01.271
Really? How?

07:01.407 --> 07:03.602
Get good grades.

07:05.611 --> 07:08.136
Now you pay twice. Four times.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.840
Sixteen. Thirty-two.

07:10.983 --> 07:12.951
Sixty-four.

07:13.419 --> 07:14.886
Alex, what are you doing?

07:15.021 --> 07:19.151
Mom.
That was just confetti for the parade.

07:20.626 --> 07:22.491
There's no parade.

07:22.828 --> 07:25.353
Not yet, but there will be.

07:25.498 --> 07:27.432
And how proud are we gonna be

07:27.566 --> 07:29.466
when we're the first ones
to throw the confetti?

07:29.602 --> 07:32.093
My guess, pretty proud.

07:33.606 --> 07:35.699
You know what?
l've got a magazine and an iced tea.

07:35.841 --> 07:37.502
l'm good with whatever you're up to.

07:45.718 --> 07:47.652
ls that the new issue
of Urban Terrace Gardening?

07:47.787 --> 07:49.846
- l've been waiting for that.
- Alex.

07:53.025 --> 07:56.051
l got to the corner,
and l realized l forgot to stretch.

07:56.195 --> 07:57.594
And it's hot.

07:58.964 --> 08:01.626
l think l'll start jogging in the fall.

08:03.002 --> 08:05.562
Alex Russo,
your exam results plus the homework--

08:05.705 --> 08:08.367
- What'd you say, Alex?
- Nothing.

08:09.141 --> 08:12.770
Alex, it's not very ladylike
to talk with your mouth full.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.513
Hey, what's that?

08:21.520 --> 08:23.488
- These parents are now not
- What are you doing?

08:23.622 --> 08:26.182
Two guinea pigs should fill their slot

08:29.895 --> 08:33.092
What did l just do? l panicked.
l had to buy myself more time.

08:33.232 --> 08:35.666
- To do what?
- To panic.

08:39.804 --> 08:41.932
l still don't know
why you'd spend your entire savings

08:42.073 --> 08:43.905
on a giant blow-up exercise ball.

08:44.910 --> 08:46.844
lt's for exercise?

08:48.681 --> 08:52.310
Man, l was gonna blow this up,
then walk across the ocean in it.

08:52.752 --> 08:54.720
That is exercise, Maxy.

08:55.621 --> 08:57.020
Man.

09:00.025 --> 09:02.084
Cool. Guinea pigs. Can l race them?

09:02.394 --> 09:05.693
No. l'm still working
on Dad's transfiguration spell,

09:05.831 --> 09:08.356
and these guinea pigs
have to stay in their cage no matter what.

09:08.634 --> 09:10.625
Fine. l'll just go ask Mom and Dad.

09:10.770 --> 09:11.964
Mom and Dad aren't here,

09:12.104 --> 09:15.335
because they went to an emergency
sandwich-shop convention.

09:17.443 --> 09:19.877
Emergency sandwich-shop convention?

09:20.012 --> 09:23.311
Yeah. You know how you were all tweaked
because sandwich wraps are tortillas,

09:23.449 --> 09:24.780
and they don't get enough credit?

09:24.917 --> 09:27.442
Well,
people are finally getting behind that.

09:27.586 --> 09:29.486
Yes. My e-mail campaign worked.

09:30.456 --> 09:33.721
Now, wait. Now get out of here, you guys.
l'm having my AP biology friends over

09:33.859 --> 09:37.226
to watch the new episode
of Volcano Discovery in high-def.

09:37.363 --> 09:39.228
And l don't want you guys
to embarrass me.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.598
We are not the embarrassing part
of what you just said.

09:49.542 --> 09:52.568
That was the best volcano special ever.

09:53.279 --> 09:56.180
The high-def made it seem like
the volcano was right in your living room.

09:56.315 --> 09:59.978
Oh, which, geologically speaking,
would be a statistical improbability

10:00.119 --> 10:03.850
along the lines of there being
a snowstorm in the Sahara Desert.

10:04.557 --> 10:07.890
You got me. Good nerd burn.

10:12.464 --> 10:15.763
Well, l'm off to the park
to bury something.

10:15.901 --> 10:17.528
Oh, a time capsule?

10:17.937 --> 10:19.302
Yeah, sure, that.

10:19.638 --> 10:21.799
l love doing that.
You should put a cell phone in it,

10:21.941 --> 10:25.707
call it and leave a voicemail, so that way
someone in the future can pick it up.

10:26.212 --> 10:28.942
No, actually, people take my calls now.

10:34.053 --> 10:35.850
Harper, what are you doing here?

10:36.655 --> 10:37.986
l heard about Justin's big party,

10:38.123 --> 10:40.318
and l've been working up the nerve
to crash it.

10:40.793 --> 10:43.694
Well, l've been working up the nerve
to leave. Oh, look, l did it.

10:47.299 --> 10:53.465
Hey, everyone. So volcanoes, huh?
That's a hot topic. Am l right?

10:56.242 --> 10:58.540
Volcanoes, they're hot.

10:58.944 --> 11:00.878
We're off volcanoes.

11:02.381 --> 11:03.871
Now we're debating who's smarter,

11:04.016 --> 11:05.950
a 12-year-old boy
or a common guinea pig.

11:06.585 --> 11:09.748
l'm on Justin's side.
Which side are you on, Justin?

11:10.656 --> 11:13.853
As always, l'm on the side of science.

11:16.295 --> 11:17.956
This calls for an experiment.

11:24.270 --> 11:28.604
This was so totally worth my allowance.
l'm gonna use it forever.

11:29.141 --> 11:31.473
Okay, when Harper says go,

11:31.610 --> 11:34.204
you'll both try and make your way
to the stack of cheese slices

11:34.346 --> 11:36.814
located outside the subway car.

11:38.784 --> 11:40.046
Three.

11:40.185 --> 11:42.380
Two. One.

11:42.888 --> 11:44.378
Go.

11:54.466 --> 11:56.696
l hate this thing.

12:03.709 --> 12:06.542
Alex's guinea pigs are getting away.
Catch them.

12:08.614 --> 12:11.606
Oh, man. We lost Alex's guinea pigs.

12:11.951 --> 12:13.976
l knew if l had party
without parental supervision,

12:14.119 --> 12:16.019
this would get out of hand.

12:16.355 --> 12:18.949
Oh, Alex is gonna freak out.

12:19.391 --> 12:21.757
Unless we buy two more guinea pigs
at the pet store.

12:22.027 --> 12:25.622
Good thinking, good thinking. Let's
hide this in the lair so Alex doesn't find it.

12:25.764 --> 12:28.164
Then we'll go to the pet store.
They always give me a treat.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.363
Those are dog biscuits.

12:30.769 --> 12:33.966
l know. What do you think keeps my teeth
so white and my hair so shiny?

12:42.982 --> 12:46.543
Look, you change into a C now,
and l promise l'll get an A next semester.

12:46.685 --> 12:48.084
And it'll all even out.

12:48.220 --> 12:50.188
Sorry.

12:50.622 --> 12:52.351
Then you leave me no choice.

13:00.199 --> 13:01.257
Alex Russo.

13:01.800 --> 13:04.291
You haven't returned
your wizard report card.

13:04.937 --> 13:08.236
Wow, talk about a paper cut.

13:12.211 --> 13:15.578
l need to speak to your parents
straightaway.

13:16.382 --> 13:18.714
l hope that's British
for much, much later.

13:20.386 --> 13:22.946
No? Okay, could you just
give me one minute? Yeah.

13:29.962 --> 13:35.764
Actually, my parents took my report card
with them to a sandwich-shop convention.

13:35.901 --> 13:39.769
l'm sure you're familiar with the tortilla
versus sandwich-wrap controversy.

13:41.807 --> 13:42.967
No? Okay,

13:50.149 --> 13:51.844
l agree.

13:51.984 --> 13:54.282
Tortillas were cheated.

13:54.420 --> 13:58.049
l can see why your parents dove
into this most pressing crisis.

13:59.725 --> 14:03.252
l'm sorry l questioned you.
Will you accept my apology?

14:03.762 --> 14:05.957
Definitely. Thanks for stopping by.
Don't be a stranger.

14:06.098 --> 14:08.123
Say hi to the little warlocks for me.

14:08.467 --> 14:10.833
Let's wizard handshake on it.

14:11.703 --> 14:14.171
The two-handed wizard handshake?

14:14.306 --> 14:16.103
That's the one.

14:21.413 --> 14:26.282
The only thing she gets an A in
is hiding and lying.

14:28.287 --> 14:30.118
Be still.

14:30.322 --> 14:31.516
You lied to me.

14:32.124 --> 14:33.216
l can explain.

14:33.358 --> 14:35.383
l'm not interested
in what you have to say anymore.

14:35.794 --> 14:37.523
l'm coming back tonight
to see your parents,

14:37.663 --> 14:40.928
and we'll decide how long
to suspend your powers.

14:41.066 --> 14:44.263
My powers? No, you can't.
l'm gonna need those.

14:44.403 --> 14:48.066
l'm also gonna need to know
a sound that someone could make

14:48.207 --> 14:50.300
to attract a guinea pig, for instance.

14:52.044 --> 14:56.378
l would try a sort of rabbit-y thing,
but with more saliva.

14:58.550 --> 15:00.279
Desist.

15:01.086 --> 15:03.850
You haven't acted
with any responsibility.

15:03.989 --> 15:06.457
Say goodbye to your magical ability.

15:07.826 --> 15:09.453
No.

15:19.505 --> 15:21.871
Okay, these guinea pigs
look just like the ones we lost.

15:22.007 --> 15:23.167
You think this'll trick Alex?

15:23.308 --> 15:25.503
What are you doing
with my guinea pigs?

15:25.644 --> 15:27.077
Yes, l do.

15:28.947 --> 15:30.812
Mom and Dad
aren't really away for the weekend.

15:30.949 --> 15:34.578
l had to turn them into these guinea pigs
to keep them from seeing my grades.

15:36.421 --> 15:40.482
So the guinea pigs in the cage
were actually Mom and Dad.

15:41.426 --> 15:43.553
Yeah, these guinea pigs
are Mom and Dad.

15:44.696 --> 15:48.393
No, were, because they scurried off,
so we bought these at the pet store.

15:48.534 --> 15:49.831
- Oh, man.
- Oh, man.

15:49.968 --> 15:52.528
Oh, man. We've lost four guinea pigs.

15:54.039 --> 15:56.064
How could you do something
so stupid?

15:56.208 --> 15:58.301
Only a stupid person
would think that my stupid thing

15:58.443 --> 16:00.968
was stupider than your stupid thing.

16:01.113 --> 16:03.047
You don't even deserve
to have wizard powers.

16:03.182 --> 16:05.742
This isn't about me right now.
This is about finding Mom and Dad.

16:05.884 --> 16:10.014
- Who you turned into guinea pigs.
- Okay, it's a little about me.

16:10.589 --> 16:11.647
Here's what we should do.

16:11.790 --> 16:14.691
We'll ask these guinea pigs
where guinea pigs would run away to.

16:14.826 --> 16:16.953
How are we gonna
ask these guinea pigs anything?

16:17.095 --> 16:19.256
Use the transfiguration spell
to turn them into people,

16:19.398 --> 16:20.695
and they'll be able to tell us.

16:20.832 --> 16:22.993
- You use it. lt's your problem.
- l can't.

16:23.135 --> 16:26.468
Crumbs suspended my powers
until Mom and Dad sign my report card.

16:26.605 --> 16:29.802
What? ls there anything else
you wanna tell me?

16:29.942 --> 16:32.069
Yeah. There's no
emergency sandwich-shop convention.

16:32.211 --> 16:34.645
Nobody cares
about your stupid tortilla movement.

16:36.215 --> 16:37.705
No, Justin, look.

16:37.849 --> 16:39.942
Will you just hurry
and say the spell, please?

16:40.085 --> 16:41.712
Fine.

16:45.724 --> 16:47.658
These guinea pigs are small,
dumb and hairy

16:47.793 --> 16:50.990
Make them human
to find Theresa and Jerry

16:51.496 --> 16:54.090
You've gotta be kidding me.
We're human.

16:55.534 --> 16:59.129
l'm gonna use my opposable thumb
to pick stuff up.

17:00.005 --> 17:02.735
Check it out.
l have things in both hands.

17:02.874 --> 17:05.741
- Ask me if l'm okay.
- Are you okay?

17:05.877 --> 17:07.867
Yes, l am.

17:08.313 --> 17:09.940
Okay, settle down.

17:10.082 --> 17:13.279
We need your help finding
a couple of guinea pigs, guinea people.

17:15.020 --> 17:20.321
- l smell peanut butter and jelly crusts.
- And dirty socks. And orange soda.

17:20.626 --> 17:21.887
Under Max's bed.

17:27.132 --> 17:30.226
Oh, Max, the door opens.
You cleaned up in here. Go.

17:34.539 --> 17:37.406
ls this marshmallows
smeared on asparagus?

17:38.110 --> 17:42.911
Yes. Yes, it is, Justin.
That experiment's almost complete.

17:43.649 --> 17:45.549
Max, what are you doing
with Mom's black dress?

17:45.684 --> 17:49.051
lt's a Darth Vader cape.
You people have no imagination.

17:52.791 --> 17:55.316
This is where my lucky mug went.

17:55.460 --> 17:57.189
There they are.

17:58.830 --> 18:01.230
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

18:01.366 --> 18:04.893
Oh, they look mad.
Maybe changing them back is a bad idea.

18:05.037 --> 18:08.700
Yeah, it's a bad idea.
Let's just be raised by two guinea pigs.

18:14.313 --> 18:15.678
Okay.

18:16.481 --> 18:20.508
These guinea pigs are now not
Mom and Dad should fill their slot

18:25.324 --> 18:27.349
Alex Russo, you are in so much trouble.

18:27.492 --> 18:30.325
l can explain, but you need to know
that Professor Crumbs is coming

18:30.462 --> 18:32.362
to discuss
my horrible report card with you.

18:35.734 --> 18:37.759
Were you eavesdropping?

18:37.903 --> 18:40.963
Mr. and Mrs. Russo, l am here--

18:41.106 --> 18:43.006
What am l standing on?

18:45.877 --> 18:48.368
lt's marshmallow surprise.

18:48.513 --> 18:51.414
The surprise is asparagus.

18:54.252 --> 18:57.744
Alex, do you wanna tell
Professor Crumbs where we were?

18:59.491 --> 19:02.619
l turned them into guinea pigs
to keep them from seeing my report card.

19:03.528 --> 19:05.519
And how did that work out for you?

19:07.032 --> 19:08.829
Not well.

19:10.669 --> 19:15.197
Oh, l see you have Alex's powers.
Don't let them fall into the wrong hands.

19:15.340 --> 19:17.865
Oh, wait, they already were
in the wrong hands.

19:19.511 --> 19:23.379
Yes, they were.
l am taking away her powers forever.

19:23.515 --> 19:29.215
l have never seen such a blatant disregard
for the student wizard code of conduct.

19:29.354 --> 19:31.845
No, please don't do this.
l've come this far. lt's not fair.

19:31.990 --> 19:35.858
l'm afraid it is. l shall take your powers
and be on my way.

19:40.432 --> 19:43.094
Professor Crumbs
turned into a guinea pig.

19:43.702 --> 19:45.533
Sweet.

19:47.205 --> 19:49.230
Don't look at me.
l don't have my powers.

19:50.375 --> 19:51.569
Justin?

19:53.645 --> 19:54.703
l panicked.

19:56.281 --> 19:59.307
This is my problem, not yours.
Don't let me drag you down.

19:59.451 --> 20:02.011
But you don't drag me down.
l don't want you to lose your powers.

20:02.154 --> 20:04.645
Every time you mess up,
l have to think of a way to fix it.

20:05.824 --> 20:07.189
You make me a better wizard.

20:07.325 --> 20:10.055
Look, l don't know.
Professor Crumbs as a guinea pig?

20:10.195 --> 20:12.390
Somebody's gonna lose their powers.

20:12.531 --> 20:15.329
Well, l'm not a wizard, so...

20:15.467 --> 20:17.492
What do you guys want for dinner?

20:24.109 --> 20:26.043
Justin, you have to change him back.

20:26.178 --> 20:28.305
Everybody just has to take
their medicine.

20:32.083 --> 20:36.213
This guinea pig is a bad dresser
Turn him now into my professor

20:38.223 --> 20:42.853
Justin Russo. How dare you?
You are supposed to be a model student.

20:42.994 --> 20:44.052
l'm appalled.

20:44.596 --> 20:45.824
l know.

20:47.499 --> 20:50.468
l deserve whatever punishment
you're about to give me.

20:52.037 --> 20:53.595
Professor, this is all my fault.

20:54.673 --> 20:57.699
Justin, l heard what you said
about your sister

20:57.843 --> 21:00.277
through my guinea-pig ears.

21:02.481 --> 21:07.111
And if you could do something like that,
l can't ignore it.

21:07.919 --> 21:10.410
You two bring out the best
in each other.

21:11.356 --> 21:13.153
Alex.

21:13.291 --> 21:16.522
l know l'm going to regret this,

21:16.895 --> 21:18.863
but l am returning your powers

21:18.997 --> 21:22.296
so that you can train
alongside your brother.

21:30.308 --> 21:32.970
And to your punishment,

21:33.111 --> 21:38.845
you both will spend the next two weeks
grooming my beard.

21:40.352 --> 21:43.185
l'll see you in my office
Monday morning at 8:00.

21:43.321 --> 21:45.118
Bring a comb.

21:50.262 --> 21:53.254
Alex, is there something
you wanna say to your brother?

21:54.566 --> 21:57.194
Yeah. Thanks for sticking up for me.

21:57.335 --> 22:00.361
Yeah. Professor Crumbs
really bought that story l laid onto him

22:00.505 --> 22:02.939
about you making me a better wizard.

22:03.074 --> 22:06.805
- Yeah. l really hate you.
- Yeah. l hate you too.

22:11.716 --> 22:15.880
And l guess, if it means so much to you,
l'll sign your tortilla petition.

22:16.821 --> 22:18.584
Thank you.

22:22.160 --> 22:25.857
Well, l really hate both of you.
Now we don't have any guinea pigs.
