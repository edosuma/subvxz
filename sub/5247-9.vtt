[Santanico] <i> And now
begins the ancient word.</i>

00:48.358 --> 00:50.724
<i>The sun sleeps below the sky,</i>

00:51.674 --> 00:54.004
<i>and the world
turns upside down.</i>

00:54.376 --> 00:57.213
<i>In the night,
we make our feast.</i>

00:59.948 --> 01:02.251
<i>For centuries,
I danced for them,</i>

01:02.285 --> 01:05.655
<i>the blood-gatherer,
the bringer of souls.</i>

01:05.687 --> 01:07.924
<i>I've brought them
the lost ones,</i>

01:07.957 --> 01:11.294
<i>the troubled ones,
the desperate ones.</i>

01:12.794 --> 01:15.431
<i>Now, I am free,</i>

01:15.464 --> 01:18.561
<i>and the world
turns upside down again.</i>

01:19.507 --> 01:23.544
<i>They are thirsty for revenge,
and nothing will stop them.</i>

01:23.569 --> 01:25.804
<i>No boundaries, no borders.</i>

01:25.974 --> 01:27.893
<i>They will come for me,</i>

01:27.981 --> 01:30.350
<i>but I am coming for them.</i>

01:30.526 --> 01:32.838
<i>Their empire
of blood will fall,</i>

01:32.863 --> 01:38.425
<i>and I will not rest
until it all burns.</i>

01:49.931 --> 01:51.400
[man spits]

02:05.547 --> 02:09.109
Hey, hey. Where you going?
You can't quit.

02:09.133 --> 02:10.292
Then you dig for it.

02:10.686 --> 02:13.372
The men are exhausted.
I'm exhausted.

02:13.473 --> 02:16.655
We done about lost everything we had
chasing that stuff, and for what?

02:16.680 --> 02:17.812
For what?

02:18.635 --> 02:21.225
How about your wives,
and your little ones.

02:21.302 --> 02:23.200
Have you forgotten
about your children?

02:23.421 --> 02:27.469
I've said it once, I'll say it
again: to believe is brave.

02:27.494 --> 02:31.353
And you must be able to
sacrifice everything you have

02:31.474 --> 02:33.446
in order
to get what you seek.

02:34.672 --> 02:36.945
I want you to say it
with me: future.

02:36.978 --> 02:38.715
- [men] Future.
- Say it louder.

02:38.748 --> 02:40.082
- [men] Future!
- Future!

02:40.115 --> 02:41.983
One more time.
Louder. Future!

02:42.016 --> 02:43.658
- [men] Future!
- That's good.

02:45.246 --> 02:47.643
Fear not,
I will carry your burden.

02:48.611 --> 02:49.742
Fear not!

02:57.700 --> 03:00.904
[distant banging]

03:17.856 --> 03:18.835
[groans]

03:20.722 --> 03:21.757
Hey!

03:22.278 --> 03:23.261
Ha-ha!

03:27.162 --> 03:28.470
[grunting]

03:34.392 --> 03:35.286
Oh...

03:39.897 --> 03:41.377
[screeching sounds]

03:41.410 --> 03:42.050
Ah...

03:42.577 --> 03:43.512
Agh!

03:45.143 --> 03:46.348
Hey!

03:48.684 --> 03:51.855
[low rumbling]

03:58.994 --> 04:03.166
[hissing sound, explosion]

04:04.867 --> 04:06.929
[laughing]

04:08.603 --> 04:11.373
See it, boys?
The future!

04:11.398 --> 04:12.906
[gasping, laughing]

04:23.818 --> 04:25.391
[man] I told you.

04:28.683 --> 04:30.502
Fear no more.

04:31.093 --> 04:33.095

[truck beeping]

05:27.854 --> 05:31.696
Anybody remember
the words to "Convoy"?

05:46.950 --> 05:47.848
Pay dirt.

05:48.371 --> 05:49.839
Well, then,
I guess it's time for me

05:49.871 --> 05:52.741
to go get us
some ole... Texas tea.

05:52.775 --> 05:54.031
Hold this, would you?

05:55.577 --> 05:57.214
I will be doing the honors.

05:58.580 --> 05:59.613
[sighs]

06:06.069 --> 06:07.948
[Richie] <i> So I get it all.</i>

06:07.989 --> 06:10.659
I'm not calling you a liar,
but in my line of business,

06:10.693 --> 06:12.462
when a guy gives you
the code to the safe,

06:12.495 --> 06:13.999
he's already made off
with the loot.

06:14.429 --> 06:17.244
Don't believe me,
believe the prophecy.

06:18.180 --> 06:19.938
If not you, whom?

06:20.227 --> 06:24.320
Just make up your mind.
I've gotta leave before sunrise.

06:24.539 --> 06:25.898
El Rey, huh?

06:28.842 --> 06:30.942
How much is that
gonna cost you?

06:32.681 --> 06:35.701
Oh, some sweat and tears,

06:35.917 --> 06:39.779
but mostly blood.
A lot of blood.

06:40.126 --> 06:41.629
Once we empty that well,

06:41.654 --> 06:44.591
a thousand souls will cry out
and the gods will be appeased.

06:46.182 --> 06:49.064
But you can't
let Carlos take it.

06:49.097 --> 06:51.366
He's already
on his way there now.

06:52.028 --> 06:53.436
If he returns
with that <i> santa sangre,</i>

06:53.469 --> 06:55.264
there's no telling
what he can do.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.540
You've gotta take it
from him, Richard.

06:57.640 --> 07:00.128
It must pour forth
from your hands.

07:00.508 --> 07:03.912
Only then will they
worship you for it.

07:06.238 --> 07:07.948
Except I've gotta pay, too.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.954
Santanico belongs to me.

07:18.060 --> 07:19.604
Always has.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.307
Richard!

07:33.902 --> 07:35.446
She can't reach you.

07:38.481 --> 07:39.939
I made sure of that.

07:41.383 --> 07:44.486
You've witnessed
the rage inside of her.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.890
She thinks that by killing me,
she can be free from all this.

07:47.923 --> 07:50.345
She can't. She won't.

07:51.861 --> 07:55.958
What she truly wants
is so much deeper.

07:56.902 --> 07:58.718
It's something you
could never give her.

08:01.916 --> 08:04.742
_

08:05.773 --> 08:08.391
_

08:10.527 --> 08:11.567
_

08:13.828 --> 08:16.178
<i>Diosa. Diosa.</i>

08:18.544 --> 08:23.216
- How did they find you?
- I found them.

08:23.926 --> 08:25.762
I gave myself to them.

08:25.794 --> 08:28.431
I wanted everything
he gave you.

08:28.464 --> 08:32.638
- I wanted it for myself.
- How could you be so stupid?

08:37.673 --> 08:38.614
[gasping]

08:42.878 --> 08:45.165
- Can you walk?
- I think so.

08:49.081 --> 08:51.386
He told me I could
be his new queen.

08:52.097 --> 08:53.604
Just like you.

08:56.525 --> 08:57.536
Trust me...

08:59.668 --> 09:01.468
...you don't want
to be in my skin.

09:03.532 --> 09:05.769
[beeping]

09:07.036 --> 09:09.582
Shit! Damn it.

09:13.041 --> 09:16.648
Quick question, fellas. Which one of
you knows how to drive this thing?

09:20.994 --> 09:22.201
[screaming]

09:24.344 --> 09:27.685
- Are you crazy?!
- Not as crazy as that guy was.

09:29.430 --> 09:30.607
Now, here's
what's gonna happen.

09:31.073 --> 09:32.962
You're gonna move all three
of these building blocks

09:32.995 --> 09:35.802
upstairs on my truck,
pronto,

09:35.831 --> 09:38.134
and I am gonna build myself
a life of comfort and luxury.

09:38.167 --> 09:39.717
Comfort and luxury.

09:41.405 --> 09:43.660
- Yes, sir.
- Make it skippy.

09:46.445 --> 09:47.478
Skippy?

09:48.509 --> 09:49.463
Just...

09:55.155 --> 09:56.549
[Richie] <i> What about Seth?</i>

09:56.851 --> 10:01.591
Let him take the cash. He's out of your life,
and you're calling the shots. You win.

10:01.624 --> 10:05.127
I'm just supposed to victory dance
my way into an ambush with Carlos?

10:05.159 --> 10:06.608
I had to send him first.

10:07.588 --> 10:09.415
He gave me no choice.

10:09.899 --> 10:14.135
Look, all you have to do is
wait until he empties the well,

10:14.169 --> 10:17.859
and then take what's yours.
Take the tanker.

10:18.240 --> 10:22.797
He gets what he deserves, and
you get your heart's desire.

10:24.112 --> 10:27.614
- The keys to the kingdom.
- One problem.

10:28.550 --> 10:29.952
You don't even
know where it is.

10:31.220 --> 10:34.113
Well, then, let's find out.

10:36.792 --> 10:38.346
_

10:38.726 --> 10:41.902
[Kate gasping]

10:45.768 --> 10:47.904
- Richie?
- Kate.

10:51.005 --> 10:52.525
What the hell are
you doing here?

10:53.675 --> 10:55.656
Apparently,
having a reunion.

10:56.635 --> 10:58.114
I'm not going to help you.

10:58.373 --> 10:59.748
I'm not going
to tell you anything.

10:59.781 --> 11:03.511
<i>Cachito,</i> sh...
you don't have to.

11:05.279 --> 11:07.119
I can see it all right here.

11:08.797 --> 11:10.323
Do you know
what that means?

11:12.789 --> 11:13.678
[screams]

11:13.720 --> 11:14.562
[Richie] Stop.

11:19.834 --> 11:20.734
Let me.

11:22.136 --> 11:23.360
Come on, man.

11:24.046 --> 11:26.257
You said you were going
to let me call the shots.

11:49.298 --> 11:51.601
[Kate] <i> That's right. You
already found your own venom.</i>

11:51.634 --> 11:53.836
<i>This one... I don't need.</i>

11:53.869 --> 11:56.782
[Scott] <i> I was just so... so hungry.</i>

11:57.405 --> 11:59.342
[Sex Machine] <i> ...about a thousand souls,</i>

11:59.375 --> 12:02.069
<i>screaming out in the night.
Bam!</i>

12:07.628 --> 12:08.547
I got it.

12:08.572 --> 12:09.350
[chuckles]

12:09.795 --> 12:11.621
It ain't close, but we
can still catch up.

12:11.646 --> 12:12.254
[Kate gasps]

12:13.989 --> 12:15.586
I was going
to give her my venom.

12:16.621 --> 12:18.206
I've been waiting hours
for this.

12:20.261 --> 12:24.536
Trust me, I've been
waiting a lot longer.

12:29.601 --> 12:31.706
It's gonna be
a hell of a reunion.

13:37.740 --> 13:41.177
[rumbling]

14:02.171 --> 14:03.109
[laughs]

14:03.134 --> 14:05.029
The future looks bright.

14:08.638 --> 14:11.542
Once upon a time,
there were people who yearned

14:11.575 --> 14:14.580
to rid themselves
of the <i> culebra</i> scourge.

14:14.828 --> 14:17.080
I sold them a brilliant idea.

14:17.247 --> 14:20.151
Offer a thousand souls
to the gods,

14:20.396 --> 14:23.253
and it will end the curse
of the serpent men.

14:23.287 --> 14:25.735
You tricked them
into mass suicide.

14:26.267 --> 14:27.325
I know, right?

14:27.358 --> 14:30.161
You created the oil company
to hide it.

14:30.194 --> 14:34.098
To disguise it... like a well.
Like a blood well.

14:34.130 --> 14:36.967
That blood could
satisfy your need to kill.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.656
And what if I like to kill?

14:41.159 --> 14:45.542
I paid a very high price
to get you here, Scott.

14:45.575 --> 14:47.279
And I want you to go.

14:49.380 --> 14:52.491
- I'm not scared of you.
- You should be.

14:55.551 --> 14:58.122
- He's giving you his operation?
- [Richie] Yes.

14:58.154 --> 15:00.323
- Why?
- Because I earned it.

15:00.356 --> 15:03.226
What about Santanico?
I thought you were with her.

15:03.259 --> 15:05.462
Yes, Kate. Come on, just...
don't worry about it.

15:05.495 --> 15:09.337
I'm sorry. I didn't get to see into your soul.
You saw into mine.

15:13.969 --> 15:15.962
- You're not gonna really...
- What, turn you?

15:16.350 --> 15:17.246
No.

15:25.449 --> 15:26.551
What are you...?

15:28.451 --> 15:30.742
- What are you doing?
- This is where you get out.

15:32.489 --> 15:34.325
Go. Just go.

15:34.358 --> 15:37.161
Go Bible-thump your way to
the next town or somethin'.

15:42.231 --> 15:44.200
I have come too far

15:44.234 --> 15:46.604
and I have been
through way too much

15:46.637 --> 15:49.867
to let another Gecko boy
push me to the curb.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.205
I am going
to that blood well!

15:52.375 --> 15:54.210
So you're gonna put
this car into drive

15:54.244 --> 15:56.213
and you're gonna step
on that pedal,

15:56.245 --> 15:59.145
or I'm gonna Bible-thump your
ass all the way back to Kansas!

15:59.978 --> 16:01.124
Now!

16:14.374 --> 16:16.686
I thought you were gonna
vomit pea soup all over me.

16:22.888 --> 16:26.267
This blood well
is so important.

16:29.146 --> 16:31.248
It is going
to change everything.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.151
You know,
change isn't free, Kate.

16:33.484 --> 16:35.738
There's always a price
to pay to get what you want.

16:35.885 --> 16:38.118
Gotta crack a few eggs
to make an omelet.

16:38.377 --> 16:40.054
It's the cost
of being the boss.

16:41.124 --> 16:42.708
- Bullshit.
- Excuse me?

16:44.161 --> 16:45.796
This isn't about getting
everything you want

16:45.829 --> 16:49.200
or being a "made" guy
or whatever.

16:49.233 --> 16:51.303
That's selfish and wrong.

16:51.701 --> 16:53.598
That's the kind of thing
you do when you're broken,

16:54.138 --> 16:56.890
when you've
given up family and love.

16:57.474 --> 16:58.937
The only things that matter.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.663
I mean, isn't that
why you're doing this?

17:03.046 --> 17:04.383
To help her?

17:05.560 --> 17:06.492
Sure.

17:06.883 --> 17:09.904
Like when you helped Seth in
your little Mexican honeymoon?

17:14.911 --> 17:17.650
That was not a honeymoon,
and you know it.

17:22.266 --> 17:23.896
He really missed you.

17:26.903 --> 17:28.873
He needed his brother,
just like I needed mine.

17:28.906 --> 17:30.612
Yeah, well,
he's all set up now.

17:34.311 --> 17:37.681
Wait... are you two
working together?

17:40.961 --> 17:42.072
[chuckles]

17:42.882 --> 17:45.017
That's why you
didn't kill Malvado.

17:46.715 --> 17:48.122
You've got
something bigger planned,

17:48.155 --> 17:50.656
something that gets
everyone what they want.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.496
Yeah.

17:56.791 --> 18:00.244
You two try
and hate each other,

18:00.278 --> 18:04.783
but... God keeps
bringing you back together.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.816
Follow this path
until it ends.

18:14.584 --> 18:16.753
- I want to go with you.
- You can't.

18:16.786 --> 18:20.490
- If I fail, we both end up his slaves.
- That's not what he said.

18:22.658 --> 18:24.145
What are you talking about?

18:24.991 --> 18:28.745
When they brought me to Malvado,
I heard him talking to his men.

18:29.616 --> 18:31.161
Malvado's leaving tonight.

18:32.301 --> 18:33.670
Someone's coming
to pick him up.

18:33.973 --> 18:36.636
<i>And he's taking you with him.</i>

18:58.922 --> 18:59.970

19:00.461 --> 19:01.898
[Santanico] <i> Where is he taking me?</i>

19:02.200 --> 19:05.960
- To paradise. A place called...
- El Rey.

19:07.603 --> 19:08.860
You've seen him.

19:10.841 --> 19:12.130
You know where he is.

19:12.817 --> 19:15.388
Yes. I can show you.

19:19.649 --> 19:20.751
Take me.

19:29.441 --> 19:33.462
[playing rock music]

19:41.838 --> 19:44.250
Well, howdy there, traveler.

19:48.685 --> 19:50.383
Start you off
with a beverage?

19:50.746 --> 19:52.692
I have a very
specific request.

19:56.719 --> 19:59.230
Well, just say the word,
I'll get you what you want.

20:05.628 --> 20:07.398
[forklift engine revving]

20:07.430 --> 20:08.926
[Seth] That's it, that's it.

20:09.699 --> 20:10.976
Come on. Come on.

20:11.935 --> 20:13.495
Very nice.

20:13.936 --> 20:16.040
I'll make sure you get
Employee of the Month.

20:18.340 --> 20:19.433
What the hell
are you doin'?

20:20.577 --> 20:22.507
There's two more pallets,
genius.

20:25.349 --> 20:26.516
Nice try,<i> compadre.</i>

20:26.550 --> 20:28.051
Where do you
think you're goin'?

20:28.431 --> 20:30.456
Someplace with all kind
of umbrella drinks.

20:30.686 --> 20:33.756
- Now, step off.
- Please.

20:34.457 --> 20:35.758
Let me give you a hand.

20:36.735 --> 20:37.680
Ah!

20:43.699 --> 20:47.213
This one has very nice skin.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.383
[wolf whistles]

21:11.097 --> 21:13.265
- How do you even prepare for that?
- What?

21:13.298 --> 21:14.967
People barely felt it, man.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.468
Just a little rumble,
next thing you know,

21:16.501 --> 21:18.470
there's a wall
of water 30 feet high

21:18.503 --> 21:20.205
- comin' at you down the pike.
- Yeah.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.874
They're saying
like 200,000 people died.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.443
And you wanna hear
somethin' crazy?

21:24.475 --> 21:26.578
Like plague-of-locusts
crazy?

21:26.610 --> 21:28.312
The animals knew.

21:28.346 --> 21:30.482
They sensed that shit
and they headed for the hills.

21:30.514 --> 21:32.016
You sayin' we gotta
be like animals now?

21:32.050 --> 21:33.646
No. That's not
what I am saying.

21:35.020 --> 21:37.076
What I'm saying is
that we need to prepare.

21:37.101 --> 21:38.764
We need to build
a defensible bulwark

21:38.799 --> 21:40.831
for the inevitable disaster
that is coming our way.

21:40.870 --> 21:42.618
Yes. That's why
we put down scores.

21:42.942 --> 21:45.663
Agreed, and it was
a most splendid score

21:45.696 --> 21:46.939
that we put down
this evening.

21:49.033 --> 21:51.637
But what does one do
with the profit one acquires?

21:51.669 --> 21:55.024
One creates, one builds

21:55.173 --> 21:57.576
a business where others
can find prosperity

21:57.609 --> 22:01.323
and, in turn, kick a reasonable portion
of that prosperity upstairs to you.

22:01.348 --> 22:04.699
Bullshit. What does
Uncle Eddie always say, huh?

22:05.317 --> 22:09.683
You do the job, you bank the
money, and you work for nobody.

22:10.259 --> 22:11.523
And you do not deviate.

22:12.680 --> 22:13.591
I knew it.

22:14.243 --> 22:16.028
I fuckin' knew it, man.
You're still pissed about that.

22:16.061 --> 22:17.908
I didn't deviate,
I improvised.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.440
- It's just a graze.
- One bullet.

22:21.632 --> 22:22.943
That's all it takes.

22:26.036 --> 22:27.071
All right.

22:28.173 --> 22:29.774
No more Sorrowful Jones.

22:30.041 --> 22:32.542
We're gonna lay it down.
Right now.

22:32.676 --> 22:35.133
New goals. Real simple.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.944
Here's to...
getting rich and fat.

22:41.319 --> 22:43.622
And dying in the arms
of a beautiful woman.

22:54.810 --> 22:56.410
This just in!

22:57.008 --> 22:59.120
Destiny has made its choice.

22:59.503 --> 23:03.488
One brother has risen.
And it's not you, handsome.

23:04.186 --> 23:06.410
Ricardo took the deal.

23:06.444 --> 23:09.234
Wait. What deal?

23:09.380 --> 23:11.455
The offer
he couldn't refuse.

23:11.683 --> 23:13.171
He's the new boss.

23:17.388 --> 23:21.467
The lotion will make
your skin more...

23:22.348 --> 23:23.513
pliable.

23:27.724 --> 23:30.251
I am gonna have
so much fun killing you.

23:33.038 --> 23:35.040
Don't forget the undercarriage,
sweetheart.

23:40.160 --> 23:43.534
[Greely] Hey,
don't I get a rubdown, too?

23:46.369 --> 23:48.686
What's the matter?
You don't recognize me?

23:49.345 --> 23:51.364
I never forget half a face.

23:53.524 --> 23:56.189
Your sniveling
little brother sold us out.

23:56.205 --> 23:58.934
Look, you wanna blame someone for
turning you into Inside-Out Man,

23:58.959 --> 24:00.171
blame your boss.

24:00.888 --> 24:02.753
He's running the board.

24:02.801 --> 24:05.137
Son, the only chess master
in this tournament

24:05.169 --> 24:07.996
is hanging right beside you
on the family tree.

24:25.812 --> 24:27.110
[Kate] Hey, there's Scott.

24:28.525 --> 24:30.423
Now what do we do
about Carlos and the others?

24:30.757 --> 24:33.414
I got some gear in the back,
in case shit hits the fan.

24:33.697 --> 24:36.811
But it won't, because
we ain't gonna throw it.

24:37.221 --> 24:39.510
- Then when do we attack?
- When the time is right.

24:39.959 --> 24:41.484
And when will that be?

24:42.134 --> 24:45.038
[rumbling]

24:47.913 --> 24:49.286
What was that?

24:51.372 --> 24:53.542
[rock music plays]

24:54.416 --> 24:57.605
Okay, that's one
tall glass with ice,

24:57.789 --> 24:59.937
two shots of vodka,

25:00.390 --> 25:04.698
Tabasco sauce,
and one celery stalk.

25:05.274 --> 25:06.753
You're an angel.

25:13.425 --> 25:17.841
I think you're missing
a key ingredient there, mister.

25:19.409 --> 25:20.938
It'll come soon enough.

25:29.057 --> 25:31.388

[pump clacking
and thrashing]

25:37.384 --> 25:40.898
[Sex Machine] You can't rush the pump.
Everything is working as planned.

25:40.932 --> 25:43.107
- It's smooth...
- It's taking too long.

25:43.132 --> 25:44.528
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

25:44.601 --> 25:46.670
You push that pump,
you're gonna blow that motor.

25:46.704 --> 25:48.812
This is sacred ground
you're on!

25:49.996 --> 25:52.080
Boss said back off,
leather dick.

25:52.209 --> 25:56.214
Why don't you check yourself before
you wreck yourself, Short Round,

25:57.384 --> 26:00.370
or I'll sic one
of my new <i> culebra</i> girls on you.

26:01.150 --> 26:02.093
[laughs]

26:02.118 --> 26:02.921
That's right.

26:02.954 --> 26:07.131
You'd be surprised at what you can
find at a truck stop these days.

26:12.447 --> 26:14.199
You have your Greek chorus,

26:14.532 --> 26:16.980
but mine
is so much more beautiful.

26:19.836 --> 26:21.319
Eye of the beholder.

26:27.150 --> 26:28.530
Go play with your toys.

26:29.173 --> 26:31.412
I'll finish
securing our destiny.

26:32.816 --> 26:35.911
You know, I may have gotten a
nice new prick out of this deal,

26:35.959 --> 26:39.906
but it seems as though you have
grown an epic set of balls.

26:39.990 --> 26:43.104
You really think you can
pull one over on Malvado?

26:43.526 --> 26:44.398
Huh?

26:48.986 --> 26:50.289
I already have.

26:53.629 --> 26:55.092
Bullshit.

No room for doubt, Scott.

27:18.663 --> 27:20.146
No more compromise.

27:20.698 --> 27:23.231
If anything happens
from this day forward...

27:26.604 --> 27:28.415
...it's because I allow it.

27:37.065 --> 27:39.439
[Paloma] He's not here. We should hide.

27:42.386 --> 27:45.115
So this is where he
turned you, isn't it?

27:46.457 --> 27:48.354
No. Not yet.

27:51.809 --> 27:55.261
Then how did those cuts on your
ankle heal up so quickly, huh?

28:00.371 --> 28:02.641
You're so naive,
it breaks my heart.

28:05.509 --> 28:07.328
Why didn't you listen to me?

28:08.136 --> 28:10.536

to make when he fucks me?</i>

28:11.749 --> 28:15.397
No one is gonna touch you.
Now, get in the cage.

28:15.900 --> 28:16.961
Or what?

28:24.394 --> 28:25.864
Or he will touch you.

28:26.727 --> 28:29.148
Many men will
have their way with you,

28:29.433 --> 28:31.782
and I won't be there
to protect you.

28:32.303 --> 28:34.812
So if you listen
and do as I say,

28:35.440 --> 28:37.553
you'll help me
destroy those men.

28:39.091 --> 28:43.312
He sees inside my soul
and he gives me what I need.

28:44.021 --> 28:45.790

- All I have to do is let myself be happy.

- You're nothing but his slave.
- Better than being yours.

29:01.496 --> 29:03.708
You don't deserve
to be <i> la diosa.</i>

29:05.075 --> 29:07.585
They will call me that now.

touched you,

29:27.981 --> 29:29.449
...you deserved it.

[groaning]

30:09.034 --> 30:11.037
[keys jingling]

30:17.010 --> 30:19.621
So, uh...
how's this work exactly?

30:19.661 --> 30:23.018
You, uh... you take my skin,
and then what?

30:23.941 --> 30:25.098
You die.

30:26.186 --> 30:28.664
No. I mean,
then what for you, moron.

30:28.718 --> 30:32.394
Richie's not gonna be very happy that
you tortured and murdered his brother.

30:32.858 --> 30:35.379
Why do I care
what Richie thinks?

30:35.817 --> 30:37.683
Well, he's the new capo,
ain't he?

30:38.644 --> 30:40.333
Malvado will take care of me
before he goes.

30:40.566 --> 30:41.592
[laughs]

30:41.645 --> 30:42.612
So let me get this straight.

30:42.637 --> 30:46.939
You got your 20 fingers crossed
waiting for a handout.

30:46.973 --> 30:50.217
Or, better yet,
you feel some sense of loyalty?

30:50.813 --> 30:51.701
[laughs]

30:51.726 --> 30:53.755
It's happened to all of
us at one time, right?

30:53.846 --> 30:55.449
Turned into a little bitch
for somebody.

30:55.474 --> 30:58.396
You stop putting
yourself first.

31:00.286 --> 31:03.234
It doesn't have to be this way.
You don't have to be his bitch.

31:03.500 --> 31:06.016
Come on. What do you say?

31:07.831 --> 31:11.731
Even the great Seth Gecko
can't convince me.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.247
[sighs]

31:13.333 --> 31:14.730
That figures.

31:19.338 --> 31:21.875

Just make sure you
don't lose the keys, boys.

31:30.049 --> 31:32.018
There's a man waiting
for us upstairs.

31:32.904 --> 31:34.537
Come with me, Santanico,

31:34.605 --> 31:36.452
and you'll feel no more pain.

31:37.285 --> 31:39.422
I'm not going anywhere with you.

31:41.490 --> 31:43.302
And my name is Kisa.

31:46.998 --> 31:48.304
Where's Richard?

31:52.105 --> 31:54.140
He's off to a better life.

31:54.740 --> 31:57.191
I gave him exactly
what he wanted.

31:57.605 --> 31:59.854
You manipulated him.
You got in his head.

32:01.012 --> 32:02.735
And you didn't do the same?

32:02.760 --> 32:03.730
[gasps]

32:08.521 --> 32:12.024
[Malvado panting]

32:12.058 --> 32:15.593
Don't fight it. Let my
venom fill your veins.

32:17.487 --> 32:19.027
It will keep you still.

32:42.187 --> 32:43.947
I didn't want it
to be like this.

32:46.758 --> 32:49.740
But I'm not gonna take you
up there kicking and screaming.

32:58.171 --> 32:59.482
[Malvado sighs]

33:04.042 --> 33:08.190
I have to make you
see things differently.

I want to take you.</i>

can walk in the sun.

Come with me.

34:09.574 --> 34:12.399
Now, tell me your name.

34:23.781 --> 34:26.255
My name is...
my name is Santanico.

[Kate] We shouldn't
wait any longer.

There's no sense
in running in there,

until it's all pumped.

34:38.705 --> 34:41.478
Let them think they got it,
they'll let their guard down.

34:41.693 --> 34:43.253
Scott isn't safe down there.

34:49.681 --> 34:53.110
You were gonna sacrifice him. You...

34:53.201 --> 34:55.126
You were gonna just
let him die in the crossfire?

34:55.172 --> 34:56.714
This has got nothin'
to do with Scott.

34:56.739 --> 34:59.391
- I was trying to protect you.
- No, you don't care about me.

34:59.769 --> 35:02.863
You don't care about anyone.
You just care about yourself.

35:03.079 --> 35:05.005
Did you sell
everyone out, too?

35:08.168 --> 35:09.743
My God, you did.

35:10.070 --> 35:12.039
The world is a snake pit, Kate.

35:12.072 --> 35:13.874
People bite you
if you don't bite first.

35:13.907 --> 35:15.539
You sound just like him.

35:16.991 --> 35:18.998
- He is a monster.
- No, Kate.

35:19.531 --> 35:22.658
He's almost gone. As soon as that
well's dry, he's outta here.

35:22.706 --> 35:24.395
Then everybody gets
what they want.

35:25.597 --> 35:26.611
Everybody.

35:27.430 --> 35:28.452
You...

35:30.090 --> 35:31.250
I what?

35:31.992 --> 35:34.382
I did what I had to do,
just like you did...

35:35.185 --> 35:37.385
...when you buried that girl
in the backyard.

35:38.074 --> 35:39.730
Or when you killed
that drifter.

35:43.137 --> 35:44.972
This is bigger
than your brother, Kate.

35:45.227 --> 35:47.529
This is going to happen,
it has to happen,

35:47.554 --> 35:49.678
and there's nothing any god
can do about it.

35:49.703 --> 35:50.909
[sobbing] Let me go.

35:57.046 --> 35:57.891
Kate!

35:59.385 --> 36:00.469
Damn it!

36:12.603 --> 36:14.014
You and I are taking that.

36:16.299 --> 36:20.031
You know, few people actually know
I'm a member of the Green Party.

36:21.866 --> 36:23.350
[high-pitched squeal]

36:23.384 --> 36:24.158
Ah!

36:24.491 --> 36:25.472
[Santanico] <i> Seth.</i>

36:27.579 --> 36:30.381
- Seth.
- Ah! Ah!

36:31.312 --> 36:34.179
- Seth.
- [Greely] Hey!

36:36.923 --> 36:38.899
You... all right.

36:40.352 --> 36:41.512
Ahh!

36:43.478 --> 36:46.838
You know, for the record, I actually
like you better than the other one.

36:48.034 --> 36:50.635
Ah! Ah!

36:53.139 --> 36:55.809
[playing rock music]

37:00.887 --> 37:01.735
_

37:02.101 --> 37:03.268
It's time to go.

37:03.712 --> 37:05.387
Not done with my beverage yet.

37:06.670 --> 37:07.981
That looks like enough.

37:09.123 --> 37:11.192
El Rey requires
payment in full.

37:11.224 --> 37:14.695
We can't leave until every soul
is released from the blood well.

37:30.307 --> 37:31.606
[blood bubbling softly]

37:31.878 --> 37:33.346
You shouldn't
have come here, Kate.

37:33.380 --> 37:35.240
I'm trying
to save your life, Scott.

37:36.016 --> 37:39.182
- Look, tell him what you told me.
- You are being tricked.

37:39.418 --> 37:42.088
If you don't stop that pump
right now, Malvado and Richie

37:42.121 --> 37:44.052
- are gonna get exactly what they want.
- Richard?

37:46.025 --> 37:47.012
Richard.

37:51.134 --> 37:52.077
Go!

37:52.547 --> 37:53.518
Look out!

38:00.423 --> 38:02.209
Gimme the keys
to the truck, Carlito.

38:13.134 --> 38:14.900
Who the fuck are you?

38:17.891 --> 38:19.929
Nobody messes with my man.

38:21.619 --> 38:23.038
So, how'd you do it?

38:27.471 --> 38:28.553
How'd I do what?

38:28.756 --> 38:30.525
How'd you get her
to go with you?

38:35.509 --> 38:38.012
[Malvado] She came to her senses
when she realized exactly...

38:38.045 --> 38:40.079
- [Santanico] <i> Seth.</i>
- Talk to me.

38:40.112 --> 38:43.220
- Talk to me. I need more.
- Behind the desk. Hurry.

38:49.989 --> 38:51.759
Close enough
for government work.

39:11.133 --> 39:12.367
[gulping]

39:12.391 --> 39:13.213
Mm...

39:17.305 --> 39:17.916
Mm... Mm.

39:17.941 --> 39:19.004
[ice rattles]

39:21.420 --> 39:22.771
[sighs]

39:33.670 --> 39:36.121
Paradise awaits us.

39:36.352 --> 39:38.384
<i>Our time has come, mi diosa.</i>

39:46.885 --> 39:48.462
My name is Kisa.

39:49.696 --> 39:50.596
Aaahhh!

39:52.877 --> 39:56.777
[screaming]

39:57.924 --> 39:59.142
<i>Descarado.</i>

40:06.952 --> 40:07.977
[grunts]

40:09.369 --> 40:11.437
[growls]

40:12.072 --> 40:14.715
- You're a bitch.
- True.

40:15.342 --> 40:16.734
But I'm not your bitch.

40:20.313 --> 40:22.181
[growls]

40:22.556 --> 40:24.808
Wings aren't gonna do you
any good in here,<i> linda.</i>

40:24.952 --> 40:26.568
Pretty sure she knows that.

40:27.916 --> 40:29.588
Thanks for taking my call.

40:32.193 --> 40:33.971
Only cost me 33 mill.

40:37.297 --> 40:41.101
- [hissing]
- [grunting]

40:41.142 --> 40:42.622
[hissing]

40:43.536 --> 40:45.071
[grunting]

40:56.723 --> 40:58.384
I took you by force once.

40:58.418 --> 40:59.353
[gasps]

40:59.913 --> 41:01.325
I'll take you again.

41:01.918 --> 41:03.576
Seth, no!

41:11.979 --> 41:13.107
Oh!

41:15.034 --> 41:18.504
- [wheezing]
- [laughs]

41:19.165 --> 41:20.851
That the best you can do?

41:22.342 --> 41:26.009
You should have learned the first
time not to work with a Gecko.

41:26.040 --> 41:27.698
Oh! Ah!

41:29.061 --> 41:31.258
Because we'll always
stab you in the back.

41:33.831 --> 41:35.490
[hissing]

41:39.475 --> 41:40.855
[screams]

41:51.973 --> 41:52.990
[gasping]

41:53.015 --> 41:53.813
No.

41:54.173 --> 41:55.939
Santanico,<i> por favor.</i>

41:56.506 --> 41:58.814
I've waited
a thousand years for this.

41:59.308 --> 42:03.535
All I ever wanted was to live
in eternity with you.

42:04.550 --> 42:06.119
Is that so wrong?

42:06.626 --> 42:09.049
I have all the possessions
in the world.

42:09.896 --> 42:11.736
But you were
never a possession.

42:13.193 --> 42:15.028
I always cherished you.

42:15.662 --> 42:17.197
I still do.

42:18.798 --> 42:20.001
Not anymore.

42:29.204 --> 42:32.819
[screaming] Kisa!

42:40.647 --> 42:41.823
[sniffles]

42:51.991 --> 42:52.833
[engine starts]

42:52.865 --> 42:56.170
[pump clacking
and thrashing]

43:04.053 --> 43:05.144
[Kate sobbing]

43:05.177 --> 43:08.407
- What did Malvado offer you?
- He didn't offer me anything.

43:08.870 --> 43:10.147
He gave it to me.

43:10.650 --> 43:12.653
Now, why don't you let her go.
She's not a part of this.

43:12.686 --> 43:17.067
- We're all a part of this.
- I'm just along for the ride.

43:17.397 --> 43:19.625
If you stop the pump,
we can negotiate like men.

43:19.659 --> 43:21.753
We're not men, Dick.

43:22.149 --> 43:25.672
And if by negotiate, you mean shoot me
and take everything I've worked for,

43:26.514 --> 43:28.281
I'm okay. Thanks.

43:28.925 --> 43:30.963
What did he offer you?

43:31.830 --> 43:34.154
- Let her go, okay?
- Not now, Scott.

43:34.537 --> 43:36.242
He wants the well
for himself.

43:36.275 --> 43:38.329
And he betrayed everyone for it.

43:39.278 --> 43:42.776
[Kate] If this thing finishes pumping,
Malvado gets everything he wants.

43:42.917 --> 43:45.485
This blood doesn't belong
to you or him or anybody.

43:45.518 --> 43:48.861
- It belongs to <i> culebras</i> like Scott.
- She's right about that.

43:49.260 --> 43:51.824
Nobody's gonna get anything unless
you stop that pump right now.

43:51.858 --> 43:54.528
- [rattling]
- [gasps, grunts]

43:54.561 --> 43:56.032
- Kate, don't!
- No!

43:57.640 --> 43:59.940
[screams, gasps]

44:03.235 --> 44:06.440
[pump clacking
and thrashing]

44:10.175 --> 44:11.166
[grunts]

44:13.547 --> 44:15.815
[pump clacking
and thrashing]

44:16.293 --> 44:17.248
Scott?
