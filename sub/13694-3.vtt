00:07.257 --> 00:09.551
PAUL: We start work on
clearing the campsite today.

00:09.634 --> 00:13.721
I can't wait to get
this climbing school up
and running.

00:13.805 --> 00:17.976
If we get it right,
it'll be fantastic
for the kids.

00:18.060 --> 00:21.897
Ah, there we are.
What do you think, Paul?

00:21.980 --> 00:25.859
We thought this
for the beginners.

00:25.942 --> 00:28.236
Well, it's easy enough
once you know
where the hand-holes are.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.321
PAUL: Oh, aye?

00:34.326 --> 00:35.702
Yeah, looks good.

00:36.787 --> 00:37.829
Have you done this before?

00:39.539 --> 00:41.248
I did some climbing
in the Paras.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.713
The Army's not
all square-bashing, you know.
It has its benefits.

00:46.797 --> 00:49.299
(CHUCKLES)
Like a girl in every port?

00:49.383 --> 00:50.884
I think you'll find
that's sailors, son.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.304
What, a sailor in every port?

00:55.472 --> 00:57.265
Never mind Duncan, Paul.

00:57.348 --> 01:00.102
He's got his mind set
on getting himself
a new girlfriend.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.104
I'd just stick to
the single life.
If I were you.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.147
Lot less complicated.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.650
You don't need to
pick one plant if you can
have the whole field.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.528
-Huh?
-He means you don't have
to settle down, son.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.656
Might not be so
easy around here though.

01:13.739 --> 01:16.660
There are plenty
of lassies in Glenbogle,

01:16.743 --> 01:18.912
if you know
where to look.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.581
-Isn't that right, Golly?
-Oh, yes, son.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.083
If you know where to look.

02:11.088 --> 02:13.382
Is she a beauty,
or is she a beauty?

02:13.467 --> 02:15.385
She certainly is that.

02:15.469 --> 02:18.347
It's gonna mean a lot
to the village, having
their own minibus at last.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.557
We'll not forget
the hard work you put in.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.517
I've enjoyed
every minute of it.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.770
You've made some
good friends too.

02:24.852 --> 02:26.438
Ron?

02:26.520 --> 02:28.815
I thought you were
supposed to be starting up
at the campsite today.

02:28.899 --> 02:29.982
Aye. I was, but...

02:30.067 --> 02:31.610
We had to pick up the wheels.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.111
Couldn't you do that
on your own?

02:33.195 --> 02:35.864
Oh, I wanted Ron to be there.
This is a team effort.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.950
Okay, just make sure
you get up there
as soon as you can, eh?

02:39.033 --> 02:40.869
Ah, the thing is...

02:40.952 --> 02:43.288
I've organised
a photographer to come
from the local newspaper

02:43.372 --> 02:45.916
so we can get some pictures
of its maiden voyage.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.251
Ron's got to be
in the pictures.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.919
Look, I'm already
behind schedule.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.006
Oh, we need the publicity.
We'll be done by lunchtime.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.965
Yeah, what am I
supposed to do
in the meantime, eh?

03:00.555 --> 03:02.265
Over there. In the corner.

03:03.599 --> 03:05.185
What's all this for?

03:05.268 --> 03:07.020
I'm starting up
a small venture.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.692
-Going into business.
-Oh, I knew that.

03:11.775 --> 03:15.112
-Doing what?
-Ah, that would be telling.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.280
I know,
but that's why I'm asking.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.783
Well, I...
I'd rather not say
just at the moment.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.619
ANDREW: Molly!

03:22.703 --> 03:25.580
(WHISPERING)
Remember, mum's the word.

03:25.664 --> 03:26.957
ANDREW: Molly?

03:27.958 --> 03:29.001
Molly?

03:31.503 --> 03:33.839
-Oh, there you are.
-(PANTING) Just...

03:33.922 --> 03:35.924
Just doing
a little tidying up.

03:36.008 --> 03:38.760
-(COUGHING)
-Oh, what's up?

03:38.844 --> 03:40.595
It's very dusty in there.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.432
In fact, I could do
with a little fresh air.
Would you join me?

03:43.515 --> 03:45.017
(COUGHING)

03:52.607 --> 03:53.817
(CHUCKLES)

03:59.114 --> 04:02.743
Glenbogle Dating Agency?

04:07.581 --> 04:09.166
There. Finished.

04:10.792 --> 04:14.129
-What?
-My marketing plan.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.380
For the outdoor
pursuits centre.

04:16.464 --> 04:20.469
We've got to
promote it properly
if we want to make it pay.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.179
Well done.
You should show it to Paul.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.432
Yeah.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.933
Yeah, I will.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.272
What's the matter?

04:35.525 --> 04:37.319
Do you think it'll be okay?

04:37.401 --> 04:39.112
The three of us
working together?

04:39.196 --> 04:41.281
Yeah, I do.

04:41.365 --> 04:43.116
I thought
you were all for him
being involved?

04:43.199 --> 04:44.701
Yeah, I was, but...

04:45.410 --> 04:47.245
I mean, I am.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.206
I am.

04:54.919 --> 04:56.630
DUNCAN: Oh! Oh, yes!

04:57.589 --> 04:58.799
You, I think.

05:00.967 --> 05:04.596
And the other
lucky lady is...

05:07.057 --> 05:08.183
...you.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.268
Oh, you wee beauty!

05:16.066 --> 05:17.859
Oh! Are you still here?

05:17.943 --> 05:20.529
Aye. Uh...

05:20.612 --> 05:23.907
-This filing cabinet,
heavier than it looks.
-Hmm.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.992
Is it, uh, all right here?

05:26.076 --> 05:28.036
-Perfect.
-Right.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.372
Well... I'll be
on my way, then.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.082
Duncan?

05:33.875 --> 05:35.168
Aye?

05:35.252 --> 05:37.461
Be a darling
and drop this off
in the kitchen for me.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.798
(SIGHS)

06:07.408 --> 06:09.286
Nearly time to see
that bus in action.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.912
Do I really
have to be there?

06:10.996 --> 06:13.081
Well, if you want to use it
for your outdoor pursuit,

06:13.165 --> 06:14.708
you ought to put in
an appearance.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.877
Okay.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.338
It's just that there's
so much to do here.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.172
I want to go really big
on the water sports,

06:21.256 --> 06:22.883
canoeing, windsurfing.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.052
-Will you manage all that
on your own?
-Yeah, no problem.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.428
As long as we take out
small parties.

06:27.512 --> 06:30.349
You know, company away days
are usually only about
half a dozen people.

06:30.432 --> 06:33.769
Yeah, that's not
who I want to attract.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.021
I think we should
run the centre for kids.

06:36.103 --> 06:38.106
That's something
I've been thinking about
for quite a while.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.317
You need special supervision
for children.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.943
No, teenagers.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.528
From deprived urban areas.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.991
I didn't have
the easiest upbringing
myself and...

06:49.785 --> 06:51.703
Well, a place like this...

06:51.787 --> 06:53.205
I'd have jumped
at the chance.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.333
Not done anything
like this before?

06:57.416 --> 07:00.170
That doesn't
mean it won't work.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.631
-You're serious, aren't you?
-Too right, I am.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.882
We could make
a real difference
to their lives.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.010
Think about it, Archie.

07:16.102 --> 07:20.357
MOLLY: So, is it
a physical relationship
you're looking for?

07:20.440 --> 07:23.485
MAN: Well, ultimately,
probably yes.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.947
But I'd like to see
how we get on first.

07:27.030 --> 07:31.326
MOLLY: I agree.
It is so important
not to rush these things.

07:33.661 --> 07:34.954
(KEYS JANGLING)

07:37.040 --> 07:38.792
Oh, the very chaps
I've been looking for.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.003
Oh, thanks, Duncan.
Two sugars in mine.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.922
What? Oh!

07:44.006 --> 07:46.049
Very funny.
No, seriously, though...

07:46.132 --> 07:48.385
Listen, you know
what we were talking
about earlier on?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.220
Oh, would that be
anything in particular?

07:50.303 --> 07:52.889
About the lassies!
In Glenbogle!

07:52.972 --> 07:54.474
About the fact that
there aren't any.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.852
Ah, well, you see.
That's just
where you're wrong.

07:56.935 --> 08:00.271
And I'm in the position
to line up a couple of
red, hot babes.

08:00.355 --> 08:03.150
And all
you've got to sort out
is which one of you

08:03.233 --> 08:05.610
is gonna take the spare one
off my hands.

08:05.694 --> 08:08.405
Son, I was hoping for
an early night, actually.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.532
Fair enough. Looks like
it's me and you, partner.

08:14.868 --> 08:15.954
Paul?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.624
Listen, I've thought
about what you said...

08:19.708 --> 08:21.376
And I reckon
we should go for it.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.502
-Really?
-Yeah.

08:22.586 --> 08:23.754
Fantastic.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.799
-Ready?
-Will this take long?

08:27.883 --> 08:29.134
There'll be
a couple of photos,

08:29.217 --> 08:31.595
and the bus goes on its way
and then so do we.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.513
And it'll give you a chance
to look over this.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.015
Oh, thanks. What is it?

08:36.097 --> 08:37.808
My marketing plan.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.020
For the outdoor
activities scheme.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.813
And a list of companies
that might be interested
within a 100 mile radius.

08:45.567 --> 08:46.985
What?

08:47.069 --> 08:49.571
It's not really the direction
we're headed in.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.281
I don't understand.

08:51.363 --> 08:53.909
It's going to be more for
young people.
16 and upwards.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.912
Yeah, city children
who might not
get a holiday otherwise.

08:56.994 --> 08:59.289
-And when was this decided?
-ARCHIE: Only just.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.666
Well, without consulting me?

09:02.833 --> 09:06.296
(EXHALES) I just don't see
this going down very well
in the village.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.215
I don't know why you're
getting so involved.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.092
You're supposed
to be doing less work,
not more.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.718
Well, I have to take
an interest.
It's my duty as...

09:11.802 --> 09:12.928
Duty as the laird.

09:14.096 --> 09:15.389
We'll talk about this later.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.433
Where's the keys? I'll drive.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.227
Unless you want me to.

09:22.436 --> 09:23.438
No need.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.911
-Can I help you?
-Oh, yes, hello.

09:37.994 --> 09:42.958
Um, this driveway does lead
to Glenbogle House,
does it?

09:43.041 --> 09:44.376
Keep going.
You can't miss it.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.670
Right.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.505
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

09:55.012 --> 09:57.471
The dating agency
suggested that I ring you.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.100
Well, what about
tonight, then?

10:02.185 --> 10:04.521
You can? Oh, that's great.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.691
Uh, 7:30?

10:08.817 --> 10:10.110
The Ghillie's Rest.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.403
Great.

10:12.486 --> 10:14.614
See you there, then.
Bye-bye.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.041
(CAMERA CLICKING)

10:30.088 --> 10:31.298
Loving it, isn't he?

10:31.381 --> 10:33.342
ARCHIE: He does like
his moment of glory.

10:33.425 --> 10:34.760
You were the one
who got this off the ground.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.135
You should be taking
credit for it.

10:36.218 --> 10:37.929
It doesn't matter.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.765
There you go, Billy.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.433
-You drive carefully now.
-Thank you.

10:41.516 --> 10:42.851
This is great, Lexie.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.894
I think we can keep the same
basic strategy,

10:44.977 --> 10:47.189
we'll have to target colleges,
youth groups.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.647
Maybe even social services.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.192
What's that for?

10:50.275 --> 10:52.527
The outdoor pursuits centre.
We had a bit of a rethink.

10:52.611 --> 10:55.113
-How do you mean?
-It's gonna be
for teenagers.

10:55.197 --> 10:58.200
That's great. There's so
little for them to do
round here.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.243
PAUL: Yeah, actually,
we're not talking
about the locals.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.204
And why not?

11:02.287 --> 11:04.790
Well, they've got all this
on their doorstep.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.793
I want to bring kids here
that have never even
seen a mountain,

11:07.876 --> 11:09.127
let alone climbed one.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.091
So, Hayley, uh...

11:15.550 --> 11:17.260
Uh, do you have
any hobbies?

11:17.343 --> 11:20.138
Ah, yes,
um, classical literature...

11:21.348 --> 11:23.308
-Needlepoint...
-Mmm-hmm.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.770
And bungee jumping.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.522
(GASPS)

11:28.604 --> 11:32.150
Well, I don't think
it'll take long to find
someone who'll suit.

11:33.819 --> 11:36.571
Well, actually, um...

11:36.655 --> 11:38.490
I saw somebody
on my way up here

11:38.573 --> 11:40.450
who's probably
a client of yours.

11:40.534 --> 11:41.993
Oh!

11:42.077 --> 11:43.787
Oh, um...

11:43.870 --> 11:45.497
Well, very tasty!

11:47.456 --> 11:49.710
Riding a motorbike.

11:49.793 --> 11:52.212
I think I might know
who you mean.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.671
Right.

11:53.755 --> 11:57.175
Well, I'd be more than happy
to give him a go.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.720
Oh, I'm sure we can do
better than that.

12:01.013 --> 12:02.180
Now...

12:05.434 --> 12:09.354
So, that's sorted.
Me and you, double date.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.773
Actually, Duncan,
I'm going to have to
give it a miss.

12:11.857 --> 12:12.858
Huh?

12:13.942 --> 12:15.610
But it's all been arranged.

12:15.694 --> 12:19.114
Yeah, sorry, mate.
I promised to take
these lads for a drink.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.450
I ought to get to know them
if we're gonna be
working together.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.082
-This is the team, then?
-It is.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.417
You won't find a better.

12:31.626 --> 12:32.961
Know their way round?

12:33.045 --> 12:36.381
Ah, should do.
Big Ron there used
to work in the estate.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.051
Good.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.804
Right, listen up.

12:42.888 --> 12:46.140
As you're probably aware,
this site's been used
for camping before

12:46.223 --> 12:48.268
and it works best
with tents pitched here.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.812
So our first job
is a shower block,
over there.

12:50.896 --> 12:52.272
-Any questions?
-Aye.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.232
These kids
you're landing us with.

12:54.316 --> 12:56.735
How do we know
they're going to
behave themselves?

12:56.818 --> 12:58.570
I'm not with you.

12:58.652 --> 13:01.615
You bring a bunch of
tearaways up here,
it affects the whole village.

13:01.698 --> 13:04.242
Well, they will be supervised
at all times.

13:04.326 --> 13:06.118
And we're talking
young offenders here?

13:06.202 --> 13:09.373
Some. But they're just kids.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.416
We'll take
full responsibility.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.753
I told you there was
nothing to worry about, Ron.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.923
I just think we should be
looking after our own
young people first.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.217
Look, some real good
could come of this, Ron.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.969
For the folks selling
burglar alarms, maybe.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.222
Okay, Ron. We understand
what you're saying,

13:25.305 --> 13:27.431
but we really need to make
a start here.

13:29.226 --> 13:31.102
Yeah, you're right.
You heard what the man said.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.188
Let's get going.

13:42.446 --> 13:43.573
Ron.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.873
No, it's just that
tomorrow would have been
easier for me. That's all.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.875
But never mind, let's...

13:53.959 --> 13:57.295
...leave it as it is. Tonight.
7:30.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.090
The Ghillie's Rest.
Okay, then.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.466
Bye-bye. Bye.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.315
Hello.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.900
Hi, yeah, it's Duncan.

14:19.984 --> 14:23.905
Listen, I was wondering,
could we make it another time?

14:23.989 --> 14:27.993
It's just that
the Ghillie's Rest
has flooded.

14:29.619 --> 14:33.081
The Angus Lodge Hotel?
Yes, I know it.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.003
Eight o'clock it is, then.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.391
What do you think?

14:52.475 --> 14:54.728
You remembered
to wash your neck.
Well done.

14:54.811 --> 14:57.189
No! The aftershave.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.483
I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.819
-I hope she's worth it.
-Oh, she is!

15:02.903 --> 15:04.363
It's a pity you
couldn't come with.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.655
(SIGHS) I told you...

15:05.739 --> 15:07.699
I know, I know,
you wanted an early night.

15:07.783 --> 15:09.076
Well, there it is.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.038
-Have a good time.
-(LAUGHING)

15:13.121 --> 15:16.291
-You too, son.
-Oh, I will.

15:32.808 --> 15:34.726
Quiet here tonight.

15:34.810 --> 15:38.188
Aye. The regulars have taken
the new community bus
for a run out.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.358
They've gone over to
the Angus Lodge
in Cairnlochan.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.320
Have you lost something,
Duncan?

15:45.404 --> 15:48.865
Huh? No.
I'm meeting someone.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.502
So you've signed up
as well?

16:01.003 --> 16:02.087
Eh?

16:02.963 --> 16:05.382
For the agency.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.135
-(EXHALES)
-Don't worry,
I'll not say a word.

16:10.429 --> 16:12.305
-Have you seen her?
-Yes.

16:12.848 --> 16:13.932
And no.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.642
(CHUCKLES)

16:16.435 --> 16:17.602
I don't understand.

16:18.353 --> 16:19.354
You will.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.531
-Hermione?
-Duncan?

16:31.658 --> 16:34.327
Champagne cocktails please,
bar steward.

16:34.411 --> 16:35.620
We'll be sitting down.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.335
So, Lord Kilwillie's
your uncle?

16:41.418 --> 16:44.254
Obviously, I don't
get my looks from
his side of the family.

16:44.338 --> 16:46.048
(LAUGHS)

16:46.130 --> 16:47.716
And you'll know Mummy,
of course.

16:49.468 --> 16:51.261
-Dorothy?
-That's her.

16:51.345 --> 16:54.473
Invites me up and then
pops off to a health farm.

16:54.556 --> 16:57.100
-So why are you here?
-Had to.

16:57.184 --> 17:01.145
Having my place decorated,
the whole shooting match.
Top to bottom.

17:01.228 --> 17:05.525
Then I get here and find out
she's signed me up
with this dating agency.

17:05.608 --> 17:09.320
So this isn't really
your sort of thing?

17:09.404 --> 17:10.946
I'll try anything once.

17:11.031 --> 17:15.202
As the rabbit said
to the polar bear.
(LAUGHS)

17:15.285 --> 17:18.621
No, the truth is, Duncan,
I have the most
terrible luck with men.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.082
The last one,
merchant banker,

17:21.165 --> 17:24.502
got transferred to Japan
just as we were
getting to know each other.

17:24.586 --> 17:28.589
The one before that
suddenly found out he only
had three weeks to live.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.425
That's terrible!

17:30.509 --> 17:32.844
That was six months ago
and apparently he's still
clinging on.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.641
You get us
another two of these,

17:37.724 --> 17:39.393
and I'll tell you
some more about myself.

17:40.602 --> 17:41.728
(EXHALES)

17:44.439 --> 17:46.440
Refills?

17:46.525 --> 17:48.235
Best make mine
an orange juice.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.610
I'd say you're in there, son.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.247
Dougal...

18:00.330 --> 18:02.498
(WHISPERING) I need you to
do me a big favour.

18:10.841 --> 18:12.801
Perhaps I can make you
something else.

18:14.344 --> 18:16.178
-Sorry?
-To eat.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.265
If you don't like that.

18:18.348 --> 18:19.683
No, this is fine.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.686
You don't seem very keen.

18:24.438 --> 18:26.273
Right, it's just that
I was, um...

18:27.315 --> 18:28.942
I was thinking.

18:29.026 --> 18:30.610
About anything in particular?

18:32.946 --> 18:34.197
About us, actually.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.283
Oh, dear.

18:36.992 --> 18:39.077
Sounds serious.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.662
Well, that's the question,
isn't it?

18:41.997 --> 18:43.123
Are we?

18:45.667 --> 18:46.793
Are we what?

18:47.627 --> 18:48.837
Serious.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.798
Where's this come from?

18:54.301 --> 18:57.345
You and some other man.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.140
In the snooker room.

19:01.433 --> 19:02.601
Billiards.

19:04.686 --> 19:07.314
And the last time
I was in Paris...

19:07.396 --> 19:09.483
Where is the nearest
French restaurant,
by the way?

19:11.985 --> 19:13.779
-Huh?
-Find out.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.947
I'd like you
to take me there.

19:16.031 --> 19:17.324
Well, put it on your list.

19:20.535 --> 19:21.787
(YAWNS)

19:21.870 --> 19:23.830
Looks like someone needs
an early night.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.667
It's been a long day.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.086
Oh, what do you do?

19:29.169 --> 19:30.629
I'm a ranger.

19:30.712 --> 19:32.881
Oh! Like the chap
in the mask.

19:32.964 --> 19:34.466
How exciting!

19:34.549 --> 19:36.802
No, I'm a ghillie.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.594
I work on a local estate.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.555
Doing what?

19:40.639 --> 19:44.142
Well, all the jobs
nobody else wants to.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.895
That'll have to change.
Write it down.

19:46.978 --> 19:48.646
Duncan? Excuse me.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.315
There's a call for you.

19:50.399 --> 19:53.068
-I never heard the phone.
-DOUGAL: It's...

19:53.151 --> 19:55.320
Got a very
quiet ring, miss.

19:57.989 --> 19:59.449
Won't be a sec.

20:05.956 --> 20:07.582
Hello?

20:07.666 --> 20:10.877
Yeah, uh...
Just calm down.

20:10.961 --> 20:13.629
Well, I'll be round
just as soon as I can.

20:14.464 --> 20:15.507
Okay.

20:16.675 --> 20:17.759
Cheerio.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.559
(DUNCAN SIGHS)

20:27.769 --> 20:30.605
That was my gran.
She's locked herself out.

20:30.689 --> 20:32.941
I'll have to go round
and climb
through the window.

20:33.025 --> 20:35.110
Didn't you tell her
you were busy?

20:35.193 --> 20:37.320
Oh, well, she's 93.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.531
I mean, what can you do?

20:40.782 --> 20:41.783
Hmm...

20:42.450 --> 20:43.493
I'll...

20:55.297 --> 20:58.008
You're not going to tell me
what he was doing
up here, then?

20:58.091 --> 20:59.551
It was nothing important.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.345
Really?

21:02.888 --> 21:05.140
Well, I'm sorry
you feel
you can't trust me.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.851
I just feel
we're a little too old
to be playing games.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.145
If I didn't know you better
I'd think you were jealous.

21:10.228 --> 21:11.271
Don't be ridiculous.

21:11.355 --> 21:12.856
-Why are you sulking?
-I'm not.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.274
Good.

21:14.358 --> 21:16.276
Because I've got other things
I could be doing.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.278
Actually, so have I.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.616
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:25.494 --> 21:26.620
Maybe.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.250
(MUSIC PLAYING)

21:32.333 --> 21:34.336
No lassies in Glenbogle!

21:34.419 --> 21:36.004
Right, I'll show you.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.258
(LAUGHTER)

21:51.185 --> 21:52.562
Duncan?

21:52.646 --> 21:54.231
Hi, I'm Helen.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.066
I was about to give up.
I thought
you weren't coming.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.571
Oh! Sorry.

22:01.655 --> 22:03.240
You've made it now,
that's all that matters.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.743
Do you want to go through
to the bar?

22:06.827 --> 22:09.663
Hmm... Why don't we, uh...

22:09.746 --> 22:11.498
Go straight up to the room?

22:16.253 --> 22:17.504
What's the matter?

22:17.587 --> 22:19.798
(GASPING) No.

22:19.880 --> 22:23.552
I thought for a minute
you said about going
straight up to the room!

22:24.594 --> 22:25.804
I did.

22:25.887 --> 22:27.597
Why do you think
I suggested
we meet here?

22:30.017 --> 22:34.271
Come on, Duncan,
we're both grown-ups.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.314
(WHISPERING)
Have you done this before?

22:36.398 --> 22:38.150
When my husband's on nights.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.071
I think I'd still like
the drink first.

22:43.155 --> 22:44.947
We'll have one sent up.

22:45.032 --> 22:47.576
How about a good, red...

22:49.536 --> 22:51.079
A good, red what?

22:51.955 --> 22:53.081
Wine.

22:53.165 --> 22:56.208
It always puts me
in the mood.

22:56.293 --> 22:58.627
It always gives me
indigestion.

23:00.714 --> 23:03.842
-I don't believe it.
-No, it does.
I'm up all night.

23:03.925 --> 23:05.093
I don't mean that.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.470
That's my old man.

23:13.477 --> 23:15.312
Why don't we...

23:15.395 --> 23:16.772
...do this...

23:17.564 --> 23:18.899
...another time?

23:22.401 --> 23:23.403
(EXHALES)

23:26.573 --> 23:29.201
-Evening.
-Hello, hello, hello.

23:32.204 --> 23:35.415
Oh, you've got to have
a sense of humour
in this job, sir.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.343
Well, fancy seeing you here.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.762
Just wanted a drink.

23:50.639 --> 23:52.641
So who is he this time?

23:52.724 --> 23:55.394
-I was in there by myself.
-Oh.

23:55.477 --> 23:58.313
Let's have a look, then,
shall we?

23:58.397 --> 24:01.817
And if there is someone,
well, let's just say...

24:02.984 --> 24:05.362
His car tax
better be up to date.

24:40.355 --> 24:41.606
(CRASHING)

24:46.653 --> 24:47.738
(SIGHS)

24:55.245 --> 24:56.788
Duncan!

24:56.872 --> 24:58.915
You really did come back.

24:58.999 --> 25:00.584
What is it? What's the matter?

25:01.251 --> 25:03.962
-Alibi.
-Alibi?

25:04.046 --> 25:05.589
I'll buy you a drink.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.841
No, no,
I'm going to get you one.

25:09.092 --> 25:12.179
So, how's your grandma?

25:12.262 --> 25:15.015
-Eh?
-Did you get her
into the house all right?

25:15.098 --> 25:17.934
Oh... Yeah, got you!
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:18.018 --> 25:19.935
Snug as a bug in a rug.

25:20.020 --> 25:22.606
And here you are again.

25:22.689 --> 25:25.525
Oh, you didn't think
I'd leave you here
on your own, did you?

25:25.609 --> 25:27.319
Wouldn't be the first time.

25:28.278 --> 25:31.031
Hermione...

25:31.113 --> 25:36.243
If I could say that
I'd spent the evening
here with you, well,

25:36.328 --> 25:38.621
you don't know
how happy
that would make me.

25:40.040 --> 25:43.543
Oh, Duncan!
That is so sweet.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.305
What happened?

25:55.389 --> 25:58.350
No idea. I just know
that it was smashed
this morning.

25:58.433 --> 26:00.185
How did you hurt
your hand?

26:00.268 --> 26:01.520
Cut it on the glass.

26:04.272 --> 26:06.190
There you go, good as new.

26:06.274 --> 26:08.276
Now, you'd better go and put
something on that.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.654
(CHUCKLES)

26:10.737 --> 26:14.324
I think it's the best night
I've ever had since they...

26:14.408 --> 26:15.867
...invented nights out.

26:15.951 --> 26:17.493
And I've had some
pretty wild ones.

26:17.577 --> 26:18.995
I think
I've got the message.

26:19.079 --> 26:20.539
You had to be there really.

26:20.622 --> 26:23.041
I'm beginning to feel
like I was.

26:23.125 --> 26:25.377
Anyway, I'm sure
you've heard enough.

26:25.460 --> 26:27.254
At last, the penny drops.

26:27.336 --> 26:28.380
(BELL RINGING)

26:28.463 --> 26:30.048
And I've got to be off.

26:32.843 --> 26:34.885
-Golly.
-Callum.

26:34.969 --> 26:37.346
Don't often see you
over this way.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.433
Ah, well, when the chips
are unwrapped,

26:39.516 --> 26:41.810
the salt comes out
of the pantry, eh.

26:41.893 --> 26:43.145
Is the laird about?

26:44.062 --> 26:45.230
Yeah, he's in the house.

26:51.403 --> 26:54.698
Your estate Land Rover
was involved in
a bit of a collision

26:54.781 --> 26:56.783
up at
the Angus Lodge Hotel.

26:56.867 --> 26:59.161
-Was anyone hurt?
-Oh, no.

26:59.244 --> 27:02.956
But, uh,
the community minibus
is in a bit of a mess.

27:03.040 --> 27:06.167
Oh, it's not even
a day old!
What was it doing there?

27:06.251 --> 27:09.837
Well, I think some of
the pub regulars fancied
a change of scenery.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.381
They what?

27:11.465 --> 27:15.802
(CLEARS THROAT) Do you know
who was driving
your Land Rover?

27:15.886 --> 27:17.846
No, we were here
all last night.

27:17.929 --> 27:21.016
-It wasn't me.
-Ah, Mother.

27:21.098 --> 27:22.684
I'm so sorry,
she's just
passed her test.

27:22.768 --> 27:25.771
No, no, hold on.
Molly was with Andrew
last night.

27:25.854 --> 27:28.357
Right. I suppose
that leaves, uh,
two people.

27:29.232 --> 27:31.276
Right. Thanks for your help.

27:35.030 --> 27:38.950
Sorry, who might they be?

27:39.034 --> 27:42.120
Well, there's Duncan,
but it's his day off,
and Paul.

27:42.204 --> 27:45.207
Ah, that mysterious
brother of yours.

27:46.333 --> 27:48.293
So, where is he?

27:48.377 --> 27:51.588
At this precise moment,
I couldn't tell you.
But I can find out for you.

27:51.672 --> 27:53.673
McINTYRE: I'd be obliged.

27:53.757 --> 27:56.343
Now, I'm afraid
I have to be on my way.

27:56.426 --> 27:59.763
The fight against crime
won't win itself?

27:59.845 --> 28:01.515
McINTYRE:
I'm not sure about that,

28:01.598 --> 28:03.975
but I do know it's my turn
to buy the pork pies.

28:09.815 --> 28:11.733
ARCHIE: Well,
it must have been Duncan.

28:11.817 --> 28:13.527
GOLLY: I don't think so.

28:13.609 --> 28:15.946
-He was in the Ghillie's Rest
all night.
-Are you sure?

28:16.029 --> 28:19.533
Oh, yes. I've heard
all about it.
Every last detail.

28:19.616 --> 28:22.119
-LEXIE: Paul, then?
-Nah, he'd have
said something.

28:22.202 --> 28:25.288
I did see him
fix the indicator
on the Land Rover

28:25.372 --> 28:27.165
and he had a cut
on his hand.

28:27.249 --> 28:28.750
Well, we should
just ask him.

28:28.834 --> 28:30.419
(CLEARS THROAT)

28:30.502 --> 28:34.339
You don't have
any pork pies
at all, do you?

28:36.758 --> 28:37.968
Don't think so.

28:39.803 --> 28:42.014
No, not my type.

28:43.639 --> 28:44.849
Too young.

28:48.602 --> 28:50.439
Too far away.

28:50.522 --> 28:53.358
No rush, take your time.

28:53.442 --> 28:56.152
Can I offer you a coffee
while you're looking?

28:56.235 --> 28:57.320
That would be nice.

29:01.366 --> 29:03.910
DOUGAL: You're a very
special person, Molly.

29:03.994 --> 29:06.288
-Oh!
-I really appreciate
what you're doing for me.

29:06.371 --> 29:07.413
(CLEARS THROAT)

29:08.790 --> 29:10.334
Not interrupting
anything, am I?

29:10.417 --> 29:13.003
No, of course not.
Ah, excuse me a minute.

29:17.132 --> 29:18.550
Back again, is he?

29:18.632 --> 29:21.636
He, uh, just wanted to, um...

29:21.720 --> 29:22.888
Look at some pictures.

29:22.971 --> 29:24.765
I know exactly
what he wanted to look at.

29:24.847 --> 29:27.642
For heaven's sake,
you don't think that
he and I are...

29:27.726 --> 29:29.603
"You're a very
special person, Molly".

29:29.686 --> 29:30.979
What am I
supposed to think?

29:31.063 --> 29:34.024
-One lump or two?
-None for me, thank you.

29:34.107 --> 29:35.650
I can't talk, not now.

29:39.112 --> 29:41.573
Well, not to me, anyway.

29:41.656 --> 29:43.450
Yeah, I was at
the Angus Lodge
last night.

29:43.533 --> 29:45.452
But not in the Land Rover.
I walked.

29:45.535 --> 29:48.413
All that way?
It must be about eight miles.

29:48.497 --> 29:49.790
Not across country.

29:49.872 --> 29:52.333
Look, why can't you just
accept responsibility?

29:52.416 --> 29:55.045
I was trying to be responsible
by not drinking and driving!

29:55.128 --> 29:58.173
-Come on,
we can sort this out.
-I didn't do it!

30:00.926 --> 30:04.680
Look, I'm sorry,
it's just that it's taken me
months of hard work

30:04.763 --> 30:06.598
to get the money together
for this bus.

30:06.682 --> 30:09.101
You know, it was gonna
be a real lifeline
for the village.

30:09.184 --> 30:11.143
I'm sorry, but to be honest,
it's not my problem.

30:11.227 --> 30:12.854
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got work to do.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.985
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

30:20.070 --> 30:23.782
Okay, then. Thanks again.
I'll try someplace else.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.534
Well! Good morning.

30:25.617 --> 30:27.368
-Hiya.
-I thought it was you.

30:28.203 --> 30:30.038
Yep, it's me.

30:30.122 --> 30:31.873
I was trying to get
an indicator lens

30:31.957 --> 30:34.501
but they sold
the last one this morning,

30:34.584 --> 30:37.921
so it looks like
it's not my lucky day.

30:38.005 --> 30:39.423
Well, it must be mine.

30:39.506 --> 30:41.925
I come
to have my car valeted
and there you are,

30:42.009 --> 30:44.469
just the man
I wanted to see.

30:44.553 --> 30:47.723
-Why, what's the matter?
-I thought you might
be able to tell me.

30:47.806 --> 30:49.516
I called the dating agency
this morning

30:49.599 --> 30:51.518
to thank them for last night,
and guess what?

30:51.601 --> 30:54.354
They've got no record
of me ever joining.

30:54.438 --> 30:56.356
-I don't understand.
-Oh, neither did I,

30:56.440 --> 30:58.483
and then I realised...

30:58.567 --> 31:00.819
My application form
must have been mislaid.

31:00.902 --> 31:03.696
-Either that or...
-Uh, no...

31:03.780 --> 31:06.491
-Actually, I can explain that.
-Not here.

31:07.242 --> 31:09.286
In fact...

31:09.369 --> 31:11.955
Why don't you come back
to Kilwillie Castle
and tell me all about it?

31:12.706 --> 31:14.166
Go on, in you get.

31:24.384 --> 31:26.218
Calm down, Ron.

31:26.303 --> 31:30.182
I can't do anything
until we find who was driving
the Land Rover.

31:32.809 --> 31:34.561
-Hello.
-Hello.

31:34.644 --> 31:37.230
-Haven't we met before?
-Yesterday.

31:37.314 --> 31:40.150
Um, it was
at Glenbogle House.
On the driveway.

31:40.233 --> 31:42.194
Of course.
You found it all right?

31:42.277 --> 31:44.071
Yes, I did. Thanks.

31:44.154 --> 31:45.614
Actually...

31:45.697 --> 31:49.242
Um, I asked Mrs MacDonald
about you.

31:49.326 --> 31:54.914
Well, I was sort of hoping
that she might introduce us.

31:54.997 --> 31:58.335
-And what did she say?
-Ooh. Um...

31:58.418 --> 31:59.835
That I could do better.

32:01.588 --> 32:02.714
Oh.

32:03.799 --> 32:04.924
Is that right?

32:08.053 --> 32:09.137
Do you like bikes?

32:10.347 --> 32:12.348
I love them.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.059
How about I take you
for a spin?

32:14.975 --> 32:17.104
Oh...

32:17.187 --> 32:20.982
Oh. Well, the thing is
that I'm actually just on my
way to meet somebody.

32:21.066 --> 32:22.400
Oh, that's a shame.

32:24.486 --> 32:27.114
I don't suppose
it could wait?

32:30.742 --> 32:32.786
Do you know what?

32:32.869 --> 32:34.413
I think it probably can!
(CHUCKLES)

32:35.080 --> 32:36.122
Good.

32:41.753 --> 32:42.879
All right?

32:45.340 --> 32:46.466
Where's the rest of the lot?

32:46.550 --> 32:47.676
I don't know.

32:47.759 --> 32:49.136
Should've been here
a while ago.

32:51.930 --> 32:53.432
Thought you said
they were a good crew.

32:53.515 --> 32:54.890
Yes. Yes, they are.

32:54.974 --> 32:57.936
What, they just turn up
when they feel like it?

32:58.020 --> 33:00.313
Well, I'm sure
there's a very good reason.

33:08.321 --> 33:10.198
-Milady.
-Thank you, Badger.

33:10.282 --> 33:12.325
Now, if there's
anything you want,
just say.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.039
Well, if you insist. Um...

33:19.249 --> 33:22.169
A little extra cream
in mine, please... Bodger.

33:23.295 --> 33:26.006
And, uh,
some more of these,

33:26.715 --> 33:27.758
when you're ready.

33:28.591 --> 33:30.302
Certainly, sir.

33:30.385 --> 33:35.599
I'm sorry we've no mugs.
I trust the best bone china
will be acceptable.

33:37.100 --> 33:41.063
Two sugars, isn't it,
if I remember correctly?

33:41.145 --> 33:42.272
You've been here before?

33:42.355 --> 33:45.108
BADGER: (CHUCKLES)
Indeed he has, milady.

33:45.192 --> 33:49.613
I believe the last time
was to help clear
a drainage ditch.

33:49.696 --> 33:51.573
(LAUGHS)

33:53.033 --> 33:55.452
I don't know
about you, Hermione,

33:55.535 --> 33:59.039
but I've always been
a great believer

33:59.122 --> 34:03.251
in servants only speaking
when they're spoken to.

34:03.335 --> 34:05.337
Oh, I'd have to agree.

34:05.420 --> 34:06.963
Hmm, good.

34:07.047 --> 34:08.630
So, Bodger...

34:08.714 --> 34:10.592
-Biscuits.
-That'll be all for now.

34:11.467 --> 34:12.678
Yes, milady.

34:15.554 --> 34:18.141
Oh, careful,
don't burn yourself.

34:18.225 --> 34:20.686
Anyone would think
you were in a hurry
to get away.

34:20.768 --> 34:22.103
You're not, are you?

34:22.187 --> 34:23.563
No.

34:23.646 --> 34:25.232
Because I've been thinking,

34:25.315 --> 34:28.150
if we were to spend
some real time together...

34:28.985 --> 34:30.445
What, now?

34:33.364 --> 34:34.949
But it's my day off.

34:35.033 --> 34:37.159
Suits us both, then.

34:37.244 --> 34:39.954
And didn't you say
something about an alibi?

34:40.038 --> 34:42.290
Because I'd hate
to be the one
who dropped you in it.

34:43.542 --> 34:44.710
Two sugars, wasn't it?

35:09.276 --> 35:10.485
(INAUDIBLE)

35:53.819 --> 35:55.530
These are for you, Archie.

35:55.614 --> 35:57.324
Thank you.

35:57.406 --> 35:59.909
If you're working for
the post office, should you
not have a little van?

35:59.992 --> 36:01.828
Not to mention
a wee uniform.

36:01.912 --> 36:03.204
It's not funny.

36:03.287 --> 36:05.040
I had to go down
to the village for these.

36:05.123 --> 36:06.458
Apparently,
there's a boycott on

36:06.541 --> 36:08.126
and nothing's
going to be delivered

36:08.210 --> 36:10.087
until the minibus
is back on the road.

36:10.170 --> 36:13.465
-You're joking?
-And there's a protest about
the new outdoor pursuit centre

36:13.548 --> 36:15.133
and the people
it's going to attract.

36:15.216 --> 36:16.677
They're up in arms, Archie.

36:19.596 --> 36:20.847
This is just ridiculous!

36:20.930 --> 36:23.308
So that's why we've got
no workforce.

36:23.392 --> 36:26.478
Well, they can't dictate
who we invite
to the estate.

36:26.561 --> 36:27.688
And what about the bus?

36:28.480 --> 36:29.980
What about it?

36:30.065 --> 36:31.566
I've already told you
it wasn't me.

36:31.650 --> 36:33.860
You want me to take
the blame for something
I haven't done.

36:33.944 --> 36:36.446
The most important thing
is getting that bus
on the road.

36:36.530 --> 36:37.906
Well, we need to
get it fixed first.

36:37.989 --> 36:39.949
Why don't they just
claim it on the insurance?

36:40.033 --> 36:42.994
It makes it very difficult
to even know who
was driving the Land Rover.

36:43.078 --> 36:44.870
Hardly worth falling out
with the village over.

36:44.954 --> 36:46.873
A rift with the locals
is the last thing we need.

36:46.957 --> 36:48.959
What, and getting
your chequebook out
is the answer, is it?

36:49.042 --> 36:50.377
It's the only answer
we've got!

36:50.460 --> 36:52.045
You'd be letting yourself
be blackmailed!

36:53.296 --> 36:54.339
Yeah, you're right.

36:56.425 --> 36:58.885
There's only one way
to sort this out
and that's face to face.

37:02.264 --> 37:03.348
So...

37:04.474 --> 37:06.435
How are you
liking it up here?

37:06.518 --> 37:08.395
It's a bit quiet for me.

37:09.979 --> 37:11.147
(BIRDSONG)

37:16.319 --> 37:18.196
Maybe you're not listening
hard enough.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.322
What do you mean?

37:20.198 --> 37:21.240
Hear it?

37:23.452 --> 37:24.661
(BIRDSONG)

37:25.287 --> 37:26.705
Yes.

37:26.788 --> 37:28.081
I've never noticed before.

37:29.583 --> 37:30.667
A lot of people don't.

37:31.585 --> 37:32.794
I wonder why not.

37:35.088 --> 37:36.965
Maybe they don't think
it's important.

37:38.300 --> 37:39.384
And you do?

37:42.512 --> 37:43.555
Yes.

37:46.475 --> 37:48.894
I don't think
we should allow things
to get out of hand.

37:48.977 --> 37:51.021
I agree.

37:51.103 --> 37:53.065
So, let's start with
how you're going to get that
bus back on the road.

37:53.815 --> 37:55.025
Come on, Ron.

37:55.108 --> 37:56.943
This means as much to me
as anybody.

37:57.944 --> 37:59.613
I've no argument
with you, lass.

37:59.696 --> 38:01.823
It's the lad here
who's out of touch
with the people.

38:01.907 --> 38:03.408
Ron, the fact is...

38:03.492 --> 38:04.534
You want facts?

38:05.452 --> 38:06.828
Well, try these.

38:06.912 --> 38:09.790
The old folks are still
having to struggle
to the shops.

38:09.872 --> 38:12.876
The under-16s shinty team
will have to disband
their game

38:12.959 --> 38:14.835
if they can't get to
away matches.

38:14.919 --> 38:17.839
The trip to the coast
for the play group
has already been cancelled.

38:17.923 --> 38:19.424
Okay, I hear
what you're saying.

38:19.508 --> 38:22.302
But are you gonna
take any action?

38:22.385 --> 38:25.889
I think we should hire
a replacement
for the time being.

38:25.972 --> 38:28.934
At last,
he admits responsibility.

38:29.017 --> 38:31.019
I had thought
we might split the cost.

38:31.102 --> 38:32.854
Did you now?

38:32.938 --> 38:35.482
We've already done a lot
to get this bus
for the village.

38:35.565 --> 38:37.651
RON: You've no idea,
have you...

38:37.734 --> 38:39.319
...about living
in the real world?

38:40.237 --> 38:41.613
Just like your father.

38:43.656 --> 38:45.826
So that's what this is
all about, is it?

38:45.909 --> 38:49.663
You've still got a grudge
for being sacked
by my father?

38:49.746 --> 38:52.916
Beats me why we need
a laird, anyway!

38:53.000 --> 38:54.418
Look, why don't we just
go down to the village

38:54.501 --> 38:56.253
and we can put
Archie's plan to them?

38:58.797 --> 39:00.257
Okay.

39:00.340 --> 39:02.217
But you'd best
leave it to me.

39:02.300 --> 39:04.136
He's not so popular
at the moment.

39:04.219 --> 39:06.346
And so you take the credit?

39:06.430 --> 39:08.639
All hail the conquering hero.

39:08.723 --> 39:11.142
Whose idea was it
to go to the
Angus Lodge, anyway?

39:11.225 --> 39:12.853
What's that got
to do with anything?

39:12.936 --> 39:15.022
Oh, yeah.
That's right, it was yours.

39:15.105 --> 39:18.316
I heard you
talking about it in the bar.
You even drove.

39:18.400 --> 39:19.942
Had one
too many, did you?

39:20.027 --> 39:21.862
Is that what you're
trying to cover up?

39:21.945 --> 39:24.239
Better tell him to mind
what he's saying.

39:24.322 --> 39:25.991
Is that a threat, Ron?

39:26.074 --> 39:28.368
PAUL: If you think
we're paying anything
for your mistakes,

39:28.452 --> 39:30.162
you can think again.

39:30.245 --> 39:32.413
You'll regret this.

39:32.496 --> 39:34.333
-Both of you!
-Look, stop it!

39:34.416 --> 39:36.208
You're all behaving
like schoolboys.

39:36.293 --> 39:37.961
I tried being reasonable
but no more.

39:38.045 --> 39:39.129
You're getting nothing, Ron,

39:39.212 --> 39:40.922
till we find out
what really happened.

(ENGINE STARTS)

39:53.977 --> 39:56.103
Where is he?
Hiding under the table?

39:57.355 --> 40:00.025
He left just after you did.

40:00.108 --> 40:01.818
Anyway, it seems
I'm not the only one

40:01.902 --> 40:03.862
making new friends
these days.

40:03.945 --> 40:07.574
Unless you're running
a motorcycle
taxi service now.

40:08.699 --> 40:10.285
You mean Hayley,
I suppose.

40:10.369 --> 40:11.912
Well, she was the one
I saw you with.

40:12.871 --> 40:14.164
Are there others?

40:14.247 --> 40:15.415
(SIGHS)

40:15.499 --> 40:18.460
She said you were going to
introduce us.

40:18.543 --> 40:20.462
That was
a misunderstanding.

40:20.545 --> 40:22.172
I have to say,
I'm pretty confused myself.

40:22.255 --> 40:25.384
I mean, are we,
you know, are we together?

40:25.467 --> 40:27.385
-Or are we free agents?
-Andrew!

40:27.468 --> 40:29.137
You're the one
with the busy social life.

40:29.221 --> 40:31.515
Because I don't know
where I stand!

40:32.849 --> 40:35.602
There is nothing between
Dougal and myself.

40:35.686 --> 40:36.770
Fine.

40:36.853 --> 40:38.604
So why does he
keep coming up here?

40:43.318 --> 40:46.446
Molly, if we can't be
honest with each other,
we can't be anything.

40:50.784 --> 40:52.577
I've started a dating agency.

40:57.331 --> 40:58.792
If they're not gonna
serve us in the village

40:58.875 --> 41:01.962
then we can order
most of what we want
from outside the area.

41:02.045 --> 41:03.964
I wouldn't bother,
if I was you.

41:04.047 --> 41:06.049
Half the signs
have disappeared.

41:06.132 --> 41:08.969
Anyone who doesn't
know the place will never
find their way up here.

41:09.052 --> 41:10.303
That's criminal damage.

41:10.387 --> 41:13.015
I don't think reporting it
will get you very far.

41:13.098 --> 41:15.684
Oh, we're not gonna be
intimidated, Golly.

41:15.767 --> 41:19.021
Fine... As long you know
this is probably
just the beginning.

41:24.359 --> 41:25.986
Why didn't you tell me?

41:26.069 --> 41:28.738
I wanted something for myself.

41:28.822 --> 41:30.449
I might have been
able to help.

41:30.532 --> 41:31.908
Maybe.

41:31.992 --> 41:35.078
But I've got to
start doing things
on my own.

41:35.162 --> 41:38.498
Forty years I played
second fiddle
to my husband but...

41:38.581 --> 41:41.251
I'm not
just Mrs MacDonald,
or Mrs Anybody,

41:41.335 --> 41:43.754
I'm a person
in my own right.

41:44.629 --> 41:45.756
I respect that.

41:46.172 --> 41:47.257
Really?

41:48.425 --> 41:51.678
You can have
all the space you need,

41:51.762 --> 41:54.723
just as long as we don't try
to deceive each other.

41:56.558 --> 41:58.018
Not telling the truth

41:58.101 --> 42:00.729
has cost me
too many relationships.

42:00.812 --> 42:02.606
I just don't want that
to happen to us.

42:04.399 --> 42:05.567
Honesty then.

42:06.860 --> 42:07.944
Honesty.

42:10.697 --> 42:12.532
Now, the question is,

42:12.616 --> 42:14.034
what do we do
about Hayley?

42:14.117 --> 42:15.160
And Dougal.

42:16.912 --> 42:20.624
I'm afraid we have to
sit them down
and face the music.

42:20.707 --> 42:22.876
Tricky thing,
this honesty business,
isn't it?

42:22.959 --> 42:24.002
(LAUGHING)

42:37.224 --> 42:39.601
Can't get much done
by yourself, surely.

42:39.685 --> 42:41.269
You're welcome to
give me a hand
if you like.

42:42.187 --> 42:43.271
Okay.

42:52.698 --> 42:54.241
As long as you do
something for me.

42:55.701 --> 42:57.244
I think I can guess
what's coming.

43:00.414 --> 43:03.582
Now, I don't care
whether you were driving
the Land Rover or not.

43:03.666 --> 43:05.877
I just want to
get this mess cleared up.

43:07.170 --> 43:09.089
People round here
have long memories.

43:10.257 --> 43:12.175
Treat them fair,
like Archie always has,

43:12.259 --> 43:14.386
and they'll do
anything for you in return.

43:15.887 --> 43:17.430
But if you
make this hard, Paul...

43:20.475 --> 43:23.020
You're gonna cause
an awful lot of trouble.

43:23.103 --> 43:24.646
Lexie, this is
a matter of principle.

43:25.605 --> 43:28.191
It isn't about the bus,

43:28.275 --> 43:32.320
or my stands in the village
or your outdoor
pursuits centre.

43:33.696 --> 43:36.408
It's about how you act

43:36.491 --> 43:38.910
and how that affects
Archie's position.

43:40.787 --> 43:44.666
So, just think about
what he's risking
by taking your side.

44:01.433 --> 44:02.976
It, uh,

44:03.060 --> 44:05.437
could be like this
every day, you know.

44:05.520 --> 44:08.523
If you and I were together.

44:08.606 --> 44:09.733
(COUGHS)

44:11.026 --> 44:12.360
Anyway,

44:12.443 --> 44:15.572
you were telling me
about your last girlfriend.

44:15.655 --> 44:17.741
I'd rather not talk about it.

44:17.824 --> 44:18.867
Oh, I'm sorry.

44:21.118 --> 44:22.162
What about you?

44:23.538 --> 44:25.832
Why aren't you
with anyone?

44:25.916 --> 44:28.709
Oh, I think we both know
the answer to that.

44:31.128 --> 44:34.800
I'm a bossy old bag
who wants everything
her own way.

44:36.468 --> 44:37.969
I'll always be on my own.

44:39.429 --> 44:40.597
Don't say that.

44:41.264 --> 44:42.348
It's the truth.

44:43.767 --> 44:44.850
It's not.

44:45.769 --> 44:47.395
There's a lot of
good in you...

44:47.478 --> 44:48.772
In everyone.

44:49.855 --> 44:52.734
It's like the birdsong thing.

44:52.818 --> 44:55.404
It's there,
even if you don't realise it.

45:07.708 --> 45:08.750
Are you busy, lass?

45:09.834 --> 45:12.212
Nothing that can't wait. Why?

45:12.295 --> 45:15.966
Well, as the old
expression goes,
what the eye doesn't see...

45:16.049 --> 45:18.510
And if the village needs
a community vehicle...

45:21.972 --> 45:23.348
My thoughts exactly!

45:28.728 --> 45:29.771
There you go.

better be important.

the MacDonalds,

causing quite a scandal.

Only I thought you might
like to know.

it's that new laddie
that did it.

-That's him.

but it's causing

were good but how do
you think it made us look?

of goodwill.

over this!

who caused the accident.

to believe that?

that you're wrong
about them as well?

is off the road.

the trouble I caused.

hit it that hard.

that it is in?

been parked with
the handbrake off.

who was driving it,
don't we?

Yeah, we certainly do!

50:02.169 --> 50:04.212
Yeah, listen up, everybody.

the outdoor activity scheme
have caused some concerns.

for not believing you.

in the right,

50:45.796 --> 50:47.798

the right way about it,
did I?

50:47.881 --> 50:50.008
LEXIE: No, well, you got there
in the end.

50:50.092 --> 50:52.010
Stubbornness
is a family trait.

50:57.390 --> 50:58.767
(MUSIC PLAYING
ON CAR STEREO)

51:00.018 --> 51:01.687
Hermione!

51:01.770 --> 51:04.606
So, now I know
what you were really
up to last night.

51:04.690 --> 51:06.608
DUNCAN: Sorry.
HERMIONE: Don't be.

51:06.692 --> 51:08.485
I thought you'd gone off
with another woman.

51:08.568 --> 51:11.947
Ah, well, you know...

51:12.030 --> 51:16.284
Keeping my nose
clean from now on,
and doing plenty of over time.

51:16.368 --> 51:17.953
The accident was my fault.

51:18.036 --> 51:20.080
-I'll pay.
-No, you won't.

51:20.163 --> 51:21.581
Hi.

51:21.665 --> 51:24.167
I'm Hermione
Trumpington-Bonnet.
Duncan's girlfriend.

51:24.251 --> 51:25.836
I'll settle the bill.

51:25.919 --> 51:28.880
Which means we'll have
much more time
to spend together.

51:28.964 --> 51:30.841
In fact, isn't this still
your day off?

51:33.969 --> 51:35.137
Go on.

51:35.220 --> 51:36.847
Take those dirty,
filthy shoes off.

51:36.930 --> 51:38.890
You're not
wearing them in my car.

51:38.974 --> 51:40.851
Listen to me
when I'm talking to you.

51:40.934 --> 51:42.435
Bye, Dunc.

51:42.519 --> 51:44.479
You can see
who wears the trousers
in that relationship.
