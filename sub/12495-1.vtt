00:07.132 --> 00:09.927
Hey, did you guys see

00:07.132 --> 00:09.927
what Captain Man

00:07.132 --> 00:09.927
did yesterday?

00:09.969 --> 00:12.721
Can we focus on algebra?

00:12.763 --> 00:14.556
There was a fire

00:12.763 --> 00:14.556
at a pet store,

00:14.598 --> 00:17.058
and Captain Man ran inside

00:14.598 --> 00:17.058
right through the flames

00:17.100 --> 00:18.727
and saved all the animals.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.437
And he didn't even get hurt.

00:20.479 --> 00:23.398
Captain Man

00:20.479 --> 00:23.398
never gets hurt.

00:20.479 --> 00:23.398
He's a beast.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.275
You know, someday,

00:25.317 --> 00:27.152
when you guys are cleaning

00:25.317 --> 00:27.152
my swimming pool

00:27.194 --> 00:28.654
'cause you failed

00:27.194 --> 00:28.654
this algebra test,

00:28.696 --> 00:30.739
then flunked out of school,

00:30.781 --> 00:34.075
I hope you remember

00:30.781 --> 00:34.075
this moment, 'cause I will.

00:37.913 --> 00:40.207
Hey, here's a cool job

00:37.913 --> 00:40.207
I could do,

00:41.333 --> 00:42.334
foot model.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.880
You guys,

00:43.836 --> 00:45.880
could we go over the list

00:43.836 --> 00:45.880
for my birthday party?

00:45.921 --> 00:47.006
Sure.

00:45.921 --> 00:47.006
No.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.465
No.

00:48.507 --> 00:50.467
But I invited 52 people,

00:50.509 --> 00:52.302
and nobody's

00:50.509 --> 00:52.302
texted me back yet.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.013
What does that mean?

00:54.054 --> 00:56.306
That people have been

00:54.054 --> 00:56.306
to your parties before?

00:56.348 --> 00:58.767
Oh, come on,

00:56.348 --> 00:58.767
my parties aren't that bad.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.478
Christmas, three years ago,

01:01.520 --> 01:04.356
15 kids ended up

01:01.520 --> 01:04.356
in the hospital.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.774
'Cause of your raw turkey.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.651
It was turkey sushi.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.403
A boy almost died.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.279
Almost.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.907
Okay.

01:12.948 --> 01:15.492
First person who helps me

01:12.948 --> 01:15.492
find an after school job

01:15.534 --> 01:19.038
gets this bowl of pine cones.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.455
(gasps)

01:20.497 --> 01:22.041
Why do you even need

01:20.497 --> 01:22.041
a job?

01:22.082 --> 01:24.668
You know,

01:22.082 --> 01:24.668
to learn responsibility,

01:24.710 --> 01:25.961
challenge myself.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.755
He wants money.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.755
I want money.

01:27.796 --> 01:28.839
Money's good.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.425
Can we please talk

01:29.214 --> 01:31.425
about my birthday?

01:31.466 --> 01:34.553
(sighs)

01:31.466 --> 01:34.553
Am I gonna have

01:31.466 --> 01:34.553
to slap a boy?

01:36.638 --> 01:40.017
Henry,

01:36.638 --> 01:40.017
can you please tell me

01:36.638 --> 01:40.017
how in the wor--

01:40.059 --> 01:42.477
Oh, I didn't know Jasper

01:40.059 --> 01:42.477
and Charlotte were here.

01:42.519 --> 01:43.437
We're studying.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.646
Are we?

01:45.981 --> 01:46.982
Mom, we're right

01:45.981 --> 01:46.982
in the middle

01:45.981 --> 01:46.982
of something.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.233
I'm not interrupting.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.233
Okay, thanks.

01:48.275 --> 01:48.859
I just have a question

01:48.275 --> 01:48.859
about your underwear.

01:48.901 --> 01:49.818
Mom!

01:50.861 --> 01:53.154
I'd like to hear

01:50.861 --> 01:53.154
the question.

01:53.196 --> 01:56.658
What is the issue

01:53.196 --> 01:56.658
with Henry's underwear?

01:56.700 --> 01:59.119
Mom!

01:59.160 --> 02:00.662
Mom, I'm not okay.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.831
Piper, we're trying

02:00.704 --> 02:02.831
to study here.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.042
I'm talking to my mother.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.461
What's wrong, baby?

02:07.502 --> 02:08.963
Jessica unfollowed me.

02:09.004 --> 02:10.338
No one cares.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.715
Henry.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.508
Why would Jessica

02:11.757 --> 02:13.508
unfollow you?

02:13.550 --> 02:16.553
'Cause she posted

02:13.550 --> 02:16.553
a picture of her

02:13.550 --> 02:16.553
with me and Allison,

02:16.595 --> 02:18.722
so I posted a comment

02:16.595 --> 02:18.722
that said,

02:18.764 --> 02:20.474
"OMG, you look

02:18.764 --> 02:20.474
so gorgeous."

02:20.515 --> 02:22.350
Well, that's nice.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.350
No.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.436
'Cause Allison thought

02:22.392 --> 02:24.436
it meant she looked gorgeous,

02:24.478 --> 02:27.230
so she posted a comment

02:24.478 --> 02:27.230
that said, "Thanks, ILY."

02:27.272 --> 02:30.734
And so then

02:27.272 --> 02:30.734
Jessica got jealous

02:27.272 --> 02:30.734
and unfollowed me,

02:30.776 --> 02:33.654
and now I hate myself

02:30.776 --> 02:33.654
and I'm gonna die.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.532
I'll call Jessica's mom

02:35.614 --> 02:37.532
and talk to her.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.661
No!

02:37.574 --> 02:40.661
That's not okay!

02:43.122 --> 02:44.623
Dang it.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.708
All these jobs say

02:44.665 --> 02:46.708
I've got to have skills.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.543
So? You've got

02:46.750 --> 02:48.543
tons of skills.

02:48.585 --> 02:49.628
Name one.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.130
You're a great dancer.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.214
No, I'm not.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.214
You could take lessons.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.343
Oh, my gosh.

02:56.384 --> 02:57.719
(Charlotte) What?

02:57.761 --> 02:59.680
I'm--I'm not great

02:57.761 --> 02:59.680
at anything.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.556
This is tragic.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.058
Here, let me see.

03:04.143 --> 03:06.854
I'm just a big pile

03:04.143 --> 03:06.854
of average.

03:07.813 --> 03:09.314
Okay. Here's a job.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.649
Where?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.484
At a store called

03:10.691 --> 03:12.484
Junk-N-Stuff.

03:12.776 --> 03:15.529
It says,

03:12.776 --> 03:15.529
"Needed, part-time helper

03:12.776 --> 03:15.529
for various duties."

03:16.488 --> 03:17.739
"Duties."

03:21.451 --> 03:24.163
And see? It says,

03:21.451 --> 03:24.163
"No special skills necessary."

03:24.203 --> 03:26.540
That's me.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.540
I've got to go get that job.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.883
You get the pine cones.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.885
Sweet.

03:39.678 --> 03:40.888
Good luck, Hen.

03:40.929 --> 03:41.889
Thanks.

03:44.265 --> 03:47.102
If you give me a pine cone,

03:44.265 --> 03:47.102
I'll lick my elbow.

03:51.272 --> 03:54.526
♪♪

04:00.866 --> 04:06.454
♪♪

04:08.165 --> 04:10.125
(growling)

04:22.763 --> 04:24.305
What are you looking at?

04:24.347 --> 04:26.016
Uh, nothing.

04:26.058 --> 04:29.019
Just, uh, this turtle's butt.

04:31.646 --> 04:32.564
Sorry.

04:47.871 --> 04:48.956
(Henry clears throat)

04:48.997 --> 04:50.874
Um, my name is Henry Hart.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.626
I'm here about the job.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.419
The job.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.503
(burp)

04:56.880 --> 04:59.466
Um, did that plant burp?

05:01.301 --> 05:03.137
Go back.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.596
Come back?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.890
Go back.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.058
Where?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.434
To the back.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.353
Oh, go to the back.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.522
Take the elevator down.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.151
What floor?

05:14.982 --> 05:17.151
Down.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.444
(plant squeals)

05:21.238 --> 05:22.530
You too.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.836
(cell phone rings)

05:35.877 --> 05:37.087
Hey, what's up?

05:37.462 --> 05:40.007
Does my basement smell

05:37.462 --> 05:40.007
like chicken poop?

05:41.091 --> 05:42.717
Yes.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.012
What?

05:45.386 --> 05:47.222
I'm down in my basement

05:45.386 --> 05:47.222
with Charlotte,

05:47.264 --> 05:50.184
and she said it smells

05:47.264 --> 05:50.184
like poop from a chicken.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.893
A sick chicken.

05:53.270 --> 05:56.773
Uh, what are you

05:53.270 --> 05:56.773
and Charlotte doing

05:53.270 --> 05:56.773
in your basement?

05:56.815 --> 05:59.151
He wants to have

05:56.815 --> 05:59.151
his birthday party

05:56.815 --> 05:59.151
down here

05:59.193 --> 06:01.320
in this chicken toilet.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.405
This is my home.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.158
Guys,

06:04.447 --> 06:06.158
I can't talk right now.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.993
I'm at a job interview,

06:06.200 --> 06:07.993
so I gotta go.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.452
(screams)

06:14.666 --> 06:17.044
Henry, you still there?

06:17.919 --> 06:20.088
(screams)

06:22.423 --> 06:24.634
(rock music blaring)

06:24.676 --> 06:26.385
(Jasper) <i> Henry?</i>

06:29.097 --> 06:30.349
<i>Henry?</i>

06:30.389 --> 06:31.892
I'll call you back.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.075
Hello?

06:56.166 --> 06:57.625
Hey, how are you?

06:57.667 --> 06:59.002
Cool. Thanks.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.002
Great to meet you.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.921
I'm doing good.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.921
What's your name?

07:00.962 --> 07:02.881
Um, I'm Henry Hart.

07:02.923 --> 07:03.965
I'm here about the job.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.384
Age?

07:04.007 --> 07:05.384
13.

07:05.424 --> 07:08.053
I'll be 14

07:05.424 --> 07:08.053
on my next birthday.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.972
Ah. So you're aging

07:08.095 --> 07:10.972
sequentially.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.724
I like that.

07:12.766 --> 07:13.934
Thanks.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.560
My name's Ray.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.560
Hi, Ray.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.354
You ask a lot of questions.

07:17.396 --> 07:20.565
I don't think I've asked

07:17.396 --> 07:20.565
any questions.

07:20.607 --> 07:21.900
Chocolate or vanilla?

07:21.942 --> 07:23.110
Vanilla.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.736
Helicopters or kangaroos?

07:25.279 --> 07:27.155
Helicopters.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.155
Love it.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.490
Scrambled eggs or dynamite?

07:30.867 --> 07:31.952
Both.

07:31.993 --> 07:32.994
Maybe.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.496
Complete this sentence,

07:34.162 --> 07:35.496
"I'm sorry, Mother,

07:35.538 --> 07:37.791
I didn't mean

07:35.538 --> 07:37.791
for my elephant to blank."

07:37.832 --> 07:39.418
Uh, lick Dad.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.419
(laughs)

07:40.460 --> 07:42.921
(both laughing)

07:44.589 --> 07:45.548
Well, that's not funny.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.716
No.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.929
Um, is this

07:47.842 --> 07:50.929
the job interview?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.847
Do you want it to be

07:50.971 --> 07:52.847
the job interview?

07:52.889 --> 07:54.557
Um, what is the job?

07:55.850 --> 07:57.436
What do you think

07:55.850 --> 07:57.436
the job is?

07:57.477 --> 08:00.439
Uh, well, the ad said

07:57.477 --> 08:00.439
part-time helper,

08:00.521 --> 08:02.565
so I'm thinking

08:00.521 --> 08:02.565
maybe you need someone

08:02.607 --> 08:07.446
to help you, you know,

08:02.607 --> 08:07.446
part time.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.741
Do you ever dream

08:09.281 --> 08:11.741
about sleeping?

08:09.281 --> 08:11.741
No.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.952
Good.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.952
If you did, you'd be dead.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.621
I am so confused.

08:16.663 --> 08:17.998
David?

08:16.663 --> 08:17.998
Henry.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.167
Can I trust you?

08:18.039 --> 08:20.167
Sure.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.960
Can you keep a secret?

08:20.208 --> 08:21.960
Totally.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.339
So I can trust you

08:22.002 --> 08:25.339
to keep a secret?

08:25.380 --> 08:26.340
Yes, sir.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.593
I'm going to blow a bubble.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.012
You're going to blow

08:30.635 --> 08:32.012
a bubble?

08:32.053 --> 08:33.472
And I'm going

08:32.053 --> 08:33.472
to blow your mind.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.776
You're Captain Man!

08:46.818 --> 08:48.278
That's right, Henry.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.530
Hold on a second.

08:51.406 --> 08:54.534
Stupid zipper

08:51.406 --> 08:54.534
always sticks.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.619
Come--

08:54.575 --> 08:56.619
Ow, that's my skin!

09:03.751 --> 09:06.213
Yeah, there we go.

09:03.751 --> 09:06.213
(chuckles)

09:06.254 --> 09:07.839
Whoo!

09:07.881 --> 09:09.757
Always good to keep

09:07.881 --> 09:09.757
the old zipper lubed.

09:10.633 --> 09:13.720
I--I can't believe

09:10.633 --> 09:13.720
I'm standing here

09:10.633 --> 09:13.720
talking to Captain Man.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.597
Why, are you a fan?

09:13.761 --> 09:16.597
Do you like me?

09:16.639 --> 09:18.558
Most people like me,

09:16.639 --> 09:18.558
but not everyone.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.810
Yeah, I'm a huge fan.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.729
Oh, man,

09:20.852 --> 09:22.729
I've got to tell Jasper

09:20.852 --> 09:22.729
about this.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.939
He's gonna freak

09:22.770 --> 09:24.939
when I tell him I'm here

09:22.770 --> 09:24.939
standing next to Captain--

09:24.981 --> 09:26.191
(screams)

09:27.567 --> 09:29.903
Sorry, but you can't tell

09:27.567 --> 09:29.903
your friends about this.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.238
Okay. But--

09:32.655 --> 09:34.824
Did you have

09:32.655 --> 09:34.824
to melt my phone?

09:34.866 --> 09:36.159
I'll get you a new one.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.160
Really?

09:36.201 --> 09:37.160
No.

09:38.370 --> 09:42.332
So, Henry, tell me

09:38.370 --> 09:42.332
why you want a job.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.751
Well, you know, to--

09:44.792 --> 09:47.587
to learn responsibility

09:44.792 --> 09:47.587
and challenge myself.

09:47.628 --> 09:48.713
So you want money?

09:48.755 --> 09:50.090
Lots of money.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.758
(elevator bell chimes)

09:55.136 --> 09:58.306
(in British accent) Oh,

09:55.136 --> 09:58.306
is this the ladies' room?

09:59.099 --> 10:00.475
No, ma'am.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.768
You're not supposed to be

10:00.517 --> 10:01.768
down here.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.271
What an interesting place.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.148
Thank you,

10:04.771 --> 10:07.148
but I'm conducting

10:04.771 --> 10:07.148
a job interview,

10:07.190 --> 10:08.816
and you're very old,

10:08.858 --> 10:11.945
so can you please just

10:08.858 --> 10:11.945
get back in the elevator?

10:11.986 --> 10:15.240
Oh, I'll just take me phone

10:11.986 --> 10:15.240
out of me purse

10:15.282 --> 10:16.783
and call me nephew.

10:16.824 --> 10:18.118
(Captain Man) Great.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.495
I'll just turn my back

10:18.452 --> 10:20.495
and look at something.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.128
What are you looking at?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.299
Captain Man!

10:33.091 --> 10:34.551
Oh!

10:34.593 --> 10:36.219
(grunting)

10:41.808 --> 10:44.018
(in normal voice)

10:41.808 --> 10:44.018
Goodbye forever,

10:41.808 --> 10:44.018
Captain Man.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.145
No!

10:46.771 --> 10:48.315
Get off of me.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.358
(Henry) Quit talking

10:48.356 --> 10:50.358
like a British lady.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.193
(in British accent)

10:50.400 --> 10:52.193
Stop pulling me wig

10:50.400 --> 10:52.193
over me eyes.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.362
I can't see.

10:57.532 --> 10:58.492
(grunts)

11:02.579 --> 11:03.871
Captain Man!

11:05.999 --> 11:07.792
Captain Man, are you okay?

11:08.376 --> 11:10.211
Captain Man is always okay.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.342
Nice work, Boris.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.218
The boy did good job.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.512
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.096
You know the--

11:18.553 --> 11:20.096
That's Boris.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.055
He works for me.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.390
(Henry) What?

11:22.890 --> 11:25.018
How'd you know he wasn't

11:22.890 --> 11:25.018
really an old lady?

11:25.059 --> 11:28.563
Uh, 'cause of the tattoo

11:25.059 --> 11:28.563
on his neck.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.064
I saw it on him

11:28.605 --> 11:30.064
up in the store.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.984
And his boobs are too wobbly.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.862
True.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.862
Go get those under control.

11:38.281 --> 11:41.576
Henry, you have a sharp eye,

11:41.618 --> 11:43.370
good instincts, a nice shirt,

11:43.411 --> 11:44.663
and you're brave.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.247
Thanks.

11:46.289 --> 11:47.374
Do you know

11:46.289 --> 11:47.374
how to make sandwiches?

11:47.415 --> 11:49.042
I do.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.628
Then you have

11:49.708 --> 11:51.628
all the qualities

11:49.708 --> 11:51.628
I'm looking for.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.506
But I--I don't--

11:54.548 --> 11:56.090
You're the one, Henry.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.676
The one to make you

11:56.132 --> 11:57.676
a sandwich?

11:57.716 --> 12:00.053
(laughs) No.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.054
Well, yes.

12:01.971 --> 12:06.434
But everybody gets old

12:01.971 --> 12:06.434
some day,

12:06.476 --> 12:08.311
even Captain Man.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.188
I can't do this forever.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.690
Do what?

12:11.730 --> 12:13.066
Protect our town, Swellview,

12:13.107 --> 12:16.819
from bad guys,

12:13.107 --> 12:16.819
bad things, bad smells.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.614
Smells?

12:19.656 --> 12:21.282
You want to be horrified?

12:21.324 --> 12:22.242
No.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.368
Watch this.

12:23.951 --> 12:27.330
(grunting and laughing)

12:27.372 --> 12:28.831
Who's the freak

12:27.372 --> 12:28.831
in the diaper?

12:30.749 --> 12:32.001
The Toddler,

12:32.919 --> 12:34.546
and don't let the diaper

12:32.919 --> 12:34.546
fool you, kid.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.089
He's pure evil.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.674
Wow.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.384
I'll show you wow.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.636
Watch this secret video

12:39.426 --> 12:41.636
that was intercepted

12:41.678 --> 12:43.263
by my people

12:41.678 --> 12:43.263
who intercept secret videos.

12:45.014 --> 12:49.227
<i>You were supposed</i>

12:45.014 --> 12:49.227
<i>to bring me my applesauce</i>

12:45.014 --> 12:49.227
<i>two minutes ago.</i>

12:49.269 --> 12:50.520
<i>I'm sorry, Toddler.</i>

12:50.562 --> 12:53.106
<i>Sorry don't make baby happy.</i>

12:53.481 --> 12:55.942
(blowing raspberries)

12:56.735 --> 12:58.236
(man)

12:56.735 --> 12:58.236
<i>Toddler, good news.</i>

12:58.278 --> 13:00.905
<i>The radioactive zenite</i>

12:58.278 --> 13:00.905
<i>is here.</i>

13:00.947 --> 13:02.699
(Toddler)

13:00.947 --> 13:02.699
<i>Really? Whoo-hoo!</i>

13:02.741 --> 13:06.202
<i>That means we can begin</i>

13:02.741 --> 13:06.202
<i>phase two of my plan.</i>

13:06.244 --> 13:07.704
(man)

13:06.244 --> 13:07.704
<i>Will someone wipe my face?</i>

13:07.746 --> 13:08.829
(Toddler)

13:07.746 --> 13:08.829
<i>No!</i>

13:08.871 --> 13:10.998
(blowing raspberries)

13:11.790 --> 13:14.544
<i>Dang.</i>

13:11.790 --> 13:14.544
<i>That takes so much effort.</i>

13:15.712 --> 13:19.340
<i>Have one of our scientists</i>

13:15.712 --> 13:19.340
<i>build me a device to do that.</i>

13:20.133 --> 13:21.718
<i>To do what, sir?</i>

13:20.133 --> 13:21.718
<i>This.</i>

13:21.760 --> 13:23.720
(blowing raspberries)

13:25.513 --> 13:27.056
(groans)

13:27.098 --> 13:28.475
You see that?

13:28.516 --> 13:29.934
He's a maniac.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.852
And there's more maniacs

13:29.976 --> 13:31.852
like him,

13:31.894 --> 13:34.314
all dangerous

13:31.894 --> 13:34.314
to the good citizens

13:31.894 --> 13:34.314
of Swellview.

13:34.355 --> 13:37.400
Well, yeah, but we've

13:34.355 --> 13:37.400
got you to stop them.

13:37.442 --> 13:38.943
True.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.279
But I'm not as young

13:38.985 --> 13:41.279
as I used to be.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.198
(sighs) I'm almost 34.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.078
I need help, and someday

13:49.120 --> 13:51.748
someone's gonna have

13:49.120 --> 13:51.748
to take over for me.

13:51.790 --> 13:52.791
Like--

13:54.417 --> 13:55.585
Like me?

13:56.043 --> 13:57.836
What do you say, Henry?

13:57.878 --> 13:59.297
Do you want to be

13:57.878 --> 13:59.297
my sidekick?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.510
How much does it pay?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.510
$9 an hour.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.136
Whoa!

14:03.551 --> 14:05.136
I know, right?

14:07.639 --> 14:09.223
(bell rings)

14:11.976 --> 14:14.354
(Jasper) Whoa!

14:11.976 --> 14:14.354
(Charlotte)

14:11.976 --> 14:14.354
Check this place out.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.690
Hey, look at this thing.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.735
(Jasper)

14:17.691 --> 14:20.735
Wow, a bucket of swords.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.654
What are they doing here?

14:22.696 --> 14:24.405
Friends of yours?

14:22.696 --> 14:24.405
Uh-huh.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.783
Jasper,

14:24.447 --> 14:26.783
please don't embarrass me.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.702
Excuse me, sir.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.702
He's gonna do it.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.620
Yes?

14:30.662 --> 14:31.871
How much?

14:31.912 --> 14:34.332
Each sword is $100.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.917
No, no, no.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.917
How much for the bucket?

14:37.836 --> 14:39.045
The bucket?

14:39.086 --> 14:41.214
That's not a bucket.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.214
That's a barrel.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.424
It's close enough to a bucket.

14:43.466 --> 14:44.676
I collect buckets.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.969
Don't say it.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.969
I'm a bucketeer.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.014
Well, they seem

14:48.054 --> 14:50.014
like nice kids.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.058
Yeah, their names are

14:50.056 --> 14:52.058
Jasper and Charlotte.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.476
I've known them ever since--

14:52.099 --> 14:53.476
Get rid of 'em.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.019
I'll get rid of them.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.773
(Jasper)

14:56.437 --> 14:58.773
<i>Wow, what a bucket.</i>

14:59.691 --> 15:01.609
Kid sure loves that bucket.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.113
Hey.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.113
Henry!

15:06.155 --> 15:07.448
Did you get the job?

15:07.490 --> 15:08.658
(Henry) Yeah.

15:07.490 --> 15:08.658
(Charlotte) Cool.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.034
(Jasper)

15:08.700 --> 15:10.034
<i>Does that mean</i>

15:10.076 --> 15:12.036
<i>I can get a discount</i>

15:10.076 --> 15:12.036
<i>on this bucket?</i>

15:12.328 --> 15:13.788
Dude,

15:12.328 --> 15:13.788
it's my first day here.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.788
You--You guys gotta--

15:13.830 --> 15:15.540
Excuse me,

15:13.830 --> 15:15.540
mysterious foreign man,

15:16.999 --> 15:19.043
do Henry's friends

15:16.999 --> 15:19.043
get a discount here?

15:21.337 --> 15:23.130
That plant

15:21.337 --> 15:23.130
just shook its head.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.507
Wow.

15:24.549 --> 15:25.675
Would you get him

15:24.549 --> 15:25.675
out of here?

15:25.717 --> 15:26.843
How much for the plant?

15:26.885 --> 15:28.511
(mutters)

15:28.553 --> 15:31.097
The plant is not for sale.

15:28.553 --> 15:31.097
Bye, guys.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.140
Come on. I'll give you

15:31.138 --> 15:33.140
seven bucks for it

15:33.182 --> 15:34.601
and one Canadian loonie.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.979
Ahhhhh!

15:36.394 --> 15:38.979
It spit in my eye!

15:39.773 --> 15:42.400
I told you Canadian money

15:39.773 --> 15:42.400
upsets people.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.485
You guys,

15:42.442 --> 15:44.485
you've got to go now.

15:44.527 --> 15:47.280
Wait, what about my bucket?

15:47.321 --> 15:49.990
I want the pretty bucket!

15:50.032 --> 15:51.826
I love that bucket!

15:51.868 --> 15:53.494
(Charlotte)

15:51.868 --> 15:53.494
<i>Will you shut up</i>

15:51.868 --> 15:53.494
<i>about that bucket?</i>

15:57.457 --> 15:58.792
Carry on.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.715
I gotta wear this?

16:05.757 --> 16:08.092
All good sidekicks

16:05.757 --> 16:08.092
wear costumes.

16:08.551 --> 16:12.597
Sorry, but this is bad.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.515
I have more options.

16:18.436 --> 16:19.729
Too sparkly.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.652
Eh, it's a little Broadway.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.198
Too tight.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.242
Uh, way too tight.

16:35.745 --> 16:39.248
Oh, man... (sighs)

16:35.745 --> 16:39.248
I ate a lot of fruit.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.381
Hey, I like it.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.133
I like it,

16:49.175 --> 16:51.218
but it takes a lot of time

16:49.175 --> 16:51.218
to put on.

16:51.260 --> 16:54.597
And that's why you'll need

16:51.260 --> 16:54.597
this special bubble gum.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.977
Special?

16:56.975 --> 16:58.977
Read the instructions.

17:00.269 --> 17:03.940
"Chew gum, blow bubble,

17:00.269 --> 17:03.940
fight crime."

17:04.941 --> 17:06.066
Now.

17:08.736 --> 17:09.988
What's this for?

17:10.029 --> 17:12.365
It means we're engaged.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.365
What?

17:12.406 --> 17:14.617
No, I'm just kidding.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.617
That's how I'll contact you.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.285
Well, why can't you just

17:14.659 --> 17:16.285
call me?

17:16.327 --> 17:18.204
I melted your phone.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.204
Right.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.707
Now, listen closely.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.750
That wristband flashes.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.750
It flashes.

17:22.792 --> 17:25.252
A triple flashing light

17:22.792 --> 17:25.252
means emergency like,

17:25.294 --> 17:27.380
"major sitch going down,

17:25.294 --> 17:27.380
so get here fast."

17:27.421 --> 17:28.840
Right.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.675
A double flashing light

17:28.882 --> 17:30.675
means it's just important.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.426
And what is a single

17:30.717 --> 17:32.426
flashing light mean?

17:32.468 --> 17:35.013
Just to, you know,

17:32.468 --> 17:35.013
shoot me a text whenever.

17:35.847 --> 17:36.890
Got it.

17:36.931 --> 17:38.808
Now, raise your right hand.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.100
Spread your fingers.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.227
Turn your head and cough.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.645
What?

17:41.268 --> 17:42.645
(laughs) Joke.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.356
Place your left hand

17:43.396 --> 17:45.356
over your right lung

17:46.232 --> 17:47.358
and repeat after me.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.861
I, Henry Hart--

17:49.903 --> 17:52.030
pledge to be

17:49.903 --> 17:52.030
an awesome sidekick

17:49.903 --> 17:52.030
to Captain Man--

17:52.071 --> 17:54.240
pledge to be

17:52.071 --> 17:54.240
an awesome sidekick

17:52.071 --> 17:54.240
to Captain Man--

17:54.281 --> 17:55.825
and to never ever, ever,

17:54.281 --> 17:55.825
tell anyone

17:55.867 --> 17:57.785
that I am Captain Man's

17:55.867 --> 17:57.785
secret sidekick.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.662
And to never ever

17:57.827 --> 17:59.662
tell anyone

17:59.704 --> 18:01.455
that I am Captain Man's

17:59.704 --> 18:01.455
secret sidekick.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.957
You left out one "ever."

18:01.497 --> 18:02.957
Ever.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.458
It is done.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.336
Feels good.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.336
Yeah.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.464
(alarm sounds)

18:08.212 --> 18:10.464
Uh-oh.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.300
What's up, Gooch?

18:13.342 --> 18:14.510
<i>Someone sabotaged the bridge</i>

18:14.552 --> 18:15.302
<i>over the Jandy River.</i>

18:15.344 --> 18:16.846
The bridge is down?

18:16.888 --> 18:18.097
<i>Affirmative.</i>

18:18.138 --> 18:20.182
That means yes.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.182
I got that.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.308
Situation?

18:21.768 --> 18:24.186
<i>Cars in the water,</i>

18:21.768 --> 18:24.186
<i>lives in danger.</i>

18:24.228 --> 18:25.605
Understood.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.899
Phase two

18:26.188 --> 18:27.899
of The Toddler's plan.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.233
Let's ride.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.151
Wha-- Ride where?

18:31.193 --> 18:33.112
We've got people

18:31.193 --> 18:33.112
in the Jandy River

18:31.193 --> 18:33.112
that need saving.

18:33.153 --> 18:34.072
Come on.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.366
You mean we're going there

18:35.406 --> 18:37.366
together, like, right now?

18:37.408 --> 18:38.826
Yeah.

18:37.408 --> 18:38.826
Get under your tube.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.954
(beeping noises)

18:40.995 --> 18:42.288
Ready?

18:42.329 --> 18:43.748
For what?

18:45.207 --> 18:46.626
Up the tube.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.588
I don't know how to--

18:54.174 --> 18:55.468
Whoosh!

18:56.886 --> 18:59.221
(Captain Man)

18:56.886 --> 18:59.221
Just tap your belt buckle.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.224
Oh. Heh.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.354
Up the tuuuuuuuube.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.191
<i>And we're going</i>

19:09.398 --> 19:11.191
<i>to come back to that story</i>

19:11.233 --> 19:13.569
<i>so we can take you live</i>

19:11.233 --> 19:13.569
<i>to the Jandy Bridge,</i>

19:13.611 --> 19:16.572
<i>which mysteriously collapsed</i>

19:13.611 --> 19:16.572
<i>a little over an hour ago.</i>

19:16.614 --> 19:18.074
Jake, honey, come look.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.325
The Jandy Bridge collapsed.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.660
What?

19:20.701 --> 19:24.080
Oh, no,

19:20.701 --> 19:24.080
that was my favorite bridge.

19:24.122 --> 19:26.666
(reporter) <i> We understand</i>

19:24.122 --> 19:26.666
<i>there are several people</i>

19:24.122 --> 19:26.666

19:26.707 --> 19:28.334
<i>People are injured.</i>

19:28.375 --> 19:29.376
(evil laughter)

19:29.418 --> 19:30.586
What happened?

19:30.628 --> 19:31.838
They're not sure.

19:30.628 --> 19:31.838
They think--

19:31.879 --> 19:33.965
Mom, Dad, I hate my life,

19:31.879 --> 19:33.965
and I'm not okay.

19:35.341 --> 19:38.094
Not now, honey.

19:35.341 --> 19:38.094
Daddy's favorite bridge

19:35.341 --> 19:38.094
collapsed.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.054
Who cares?

19:40.096 --> 19:41.430
Your daddy cares.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.642
But every time I try

19:42.181 --> 19:44.642
to watch a video on my phone

19:44.684 --> 19:47.770
it keeps freezing,

19:44.684 --> 19:47.770
because our stupid

19:44.684 --> 19:47.770
Wi-Fi signal

19:47.812 --> 19:49.772
only gives me one bar

19:47.812 --> 19:49.772
in my room.

19:49.814 --> 19:53.067
Then just wait

19:49.814 --> 19:53.067
until the video loads

19:49.814 --> 19:53.067
before you watch it.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.695
Oh, so we're living

19:53.109 --> 19:55.695
like animals now?

19:57.155 --> 19:58.447
Later.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.282
I'll run away.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.617
I'll do it.

Hey, Henry,

20:40.907 --> 20:42.992
did you get the job?

20:43.034 --> 20:46.286
Yeah, just finished

20:43.034 --> 20:46.286
my first day.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.663
So how was work?

20:47.705 --> 20:49.582
Uh, it was pretty...

20:51.333 --> 20:52.752
interesting.

21:03.888 --> 21:05.973
We have a situation.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.024
That's right, Henry.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.692
Unless we stop

21:15.066 --> 21:16.692
The Toddler...

21:16.734 --> 21:18.611
Tonight?

21:16.734 --> 21:18.611
No, I can't do tonight.

21:18.652 --> 21:19.904
What? What do you mean?

21:19.946 --> 21:22.031
I got two responses.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.031
To what?

21:22.073 --> 21:23.699
My birthday party

21:22.073 --> 21:23.699

21:23.741 --> 21:25.826
they might come.

21:28.495 --> 21:29.914
Cool party.

Okay, you go

21:29.956 --> 21:32.083

21:32.125 --> 21:33.626
