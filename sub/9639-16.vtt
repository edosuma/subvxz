''And that's when the great Chinese
wizard Li first used dragon scales

00:08.950 --> 00:12.480
to build an impenetrable box
for safeguarding one's wand.

00:12.620 --> 00:14.780
And then in the 12th century,
there were nine native--''

00:14.930 --> 00:16.720
Time.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.220
You're supposed to keep your oral reports
under 45 minutes.

00:20.370 --> 00:21.800
Otherwise, you start losing people.

00:21.930 --> 00:23.300
Okay, Alex, you're up.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.430
- Alex?
- Oh, yeah.

00:28.570 --> 00:31.600
Your report on crystal balls:
history, usage, and manufacturing.

00:32.439 --> 00:34.500
Crystal balls: usage and manufacturing.

00:35.450 --> 00:38.750
Oh, l did mine on how to use
the really little ones for earrings.

00:38.880 --> 00:39.940
Cute, huh?

00:40.990 --> 00:43.080
End of report.

00:43.390 --> 00:44.550
You'll try it again tomorrow.

00:44.690 --> 00:47.520
- Max, you're up.
- Okay.

00:48.060 --> 00:51.320
Caldrons:
proper use and maintenance.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.190
How did all these people
get in my room?

00:55.330 --> 00:57.430
- Oh, Uncle Kelbo.
- Uncle Kelbo.

00:57.570 --> 00:59.660
Hello, future voters.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.840
Sorry for dropping in unexpectedly.

01:01.970 --> 01:03.370
Wanted to see my niece and nephews.

01:03.510 --> 01:06.640
Kelbo, what did l say about poofing in
when you visit?

01:06.780 --> 01:09.300
Oh, right, right, right.
lt sets off the smoke alarms.

01:09.980 --> 01:11.410
So, what are you guys up to?

01:11.550 --> 01:14.250
We're doing boring oral reports
without magic.

01:14.390 --> 01:15.780
You know you're wizards, right?

01:15.920 --> 01:20.150
Well, lots of times, Dad wants us to study
magic without actually using magic.

01:20.290 --> 01:22.420
Well, that's because he can't do magic.

01:23.190 --> 01:24.420
You know what l say.

01:24.560 --> 01:28.330
Those who can't take hamburger
and turn it into delicious filet mignon,

01:28.470 --> 01:29.900
teach.

01:30.440 --> 01:33.060
Okay, fine.
l didn't become the family wizard.

01:33.200 --> 01:37.330
But the things l can do
with plain hamburger will blow your mind.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.570
He puts cheese in the meat.

01:39.710 --> 01:42.410
Hey, l've had many, many, many
of his inside-out cheeseburgers.

01:42.550 --> 01:44.450
Tell me about it.

01:44.750 --> 01:45.910
So, what are you working on?

01:46.050 --> 01:49.350
Oh, well, l'm doing a report
on the great Chinese wizard Li.

01:49.490 --> 01:53.250
Chinese wizard Li? He's in my fave five.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.530 --> 02:05.590
He'll come here,
he'll teach you all about his life.

02:05.740 --> 02:08.570
He'll do anything to get away
from his witch of a wife, okay?

02:08.710 --> 02:10.940
By the way,
his wife, she really is a witch.

02:12.110 --> 02:14.770
Li, baby, how's that wife of yours?

02:17.350 --> 02:21.790
Look, l would appreciate it
if l could teach them my way.

02:22.520 --> 02:23.580
Yeah, you're right.

02:23.720 --> 02:25.350
- No more distractions.
- Thank you.

02:25.490 --> 02:28.080
- Oh, l've got presents.
- Oh, presents.

02:28.230 --> 02:31.530
Justin, l got you some opera gum.

02:31.660 --> 02:33.320
Oh, sweet. What's it do?

02:33.460 --> 02:34.990
lt's opera gum. Try singing.

02:40.970 --> 02:43.340
- l think l'll save that for the talent show.
- Great.

02:43.470 --> 02:49.380
Max, for you,
l've got the leprechaun answer blower.

02:49.910 --> 02:54.510
Ask it a question, blow a bubble,
bubble pops, there's your answer.

02:54.650 --> 02:56.550
- Give it a drive.
- Awesome.

02:56.690 --> 03:00.350
Come on, baby. What are the answers
to my social studies test?

03:03.960 --> 03:08.490
Yes-or-no questions only.
But l love that you think big.

03:08.630 --> 03:12.070
And for my favorite niece who l love.

03:12.700 --> 03:15.470
l have for you an Emoto-scope.

03:15.770 --> 03:18.300
Okay. Look through it,
you'll see how people are really feeling.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.380
Oh, cool. l've always wanted one.

03:26.850 --> 03:29.840
Wow, either you're really excited
or your underwear is on too tight.

03:35.090 --> 03:39.090
And Max has no idea what's going on.
Big shocker.

03:43.670 --> 03:45.530
Wow, you're mad inside and out.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.340
Because no one wants to finish
the wizard lesson.

03:48.470 --> 03:51.070
He's right. Who wants to go the zoo?

03:51.880 --> 03:53.370
- The zoo?
- The zoo?

03:53.510 --> 03:55.070
Let me rephrase that.

03:55.210 --> 03:57.680
Who wants to go to the zoo
as a monkey?

03:58.480 --> 04:01.180
- You're gonna turn into a monkey?
- All of us are gonna be monkeys.

04:02.290 --> 04:05.410
Sorry, Kelbo.
We frown on random uses of magic.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.250
Okay. Let's talk about it.

04:08.690 --> 04:09.990
l--

04:10.390 --> 04:11.620
Great conversation.

05:07.150 --> 05:10.750
Where are they? You know,
the burgers are almost done.

05:10.890 --> 05:12.750
Kelbo does this every time.

05:12.890 --> 05:16.950
Jerry, they're out having fun
with their uncle. lt's a good thing.

05:17.090 --> 05:19.320
Do you really trust him
to watch our children?

05:19.800 --> 05:23.160
No. But l trust our children
to watch him.

05:24.470 --> 05:26.990
- We had so much fun at the zoo.
- Oh, yeah?

05:27.140 --> 05:31.040
l didn't even turn them into monkeys,
just like you asked.

05:31.180 --> 05:34.300
Oh, good.
So then those aren't monkey tails.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.610
Chocolate?

05:40.990 --> 05:44.390
Oh, man, l wanted to find out some stuff
with my leprechaun answer blower.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.920
Oh, hey, let me ask it a question.

05:47.060 --> 05:48.790
Who is my secret admirer?

05:48.930 --> 05:52.620
l've been getting notes in my locker every
Wednesday for the past three weeks.

05:56.070 --> 06:01.270
Oh, you can't ask it that.
lt only answers yes, no or l don't know.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.530
ls it Cathy Antinocci?

06:07.810 --> 06:09.780
ls it Corrie Montanio?

06:11.880 --> 06:15.080
There's, like, 300 girls in my class.
This might take a while.

06:15.220 --> 06:18.750
Okay. But just don't suck in,
because the answer juice tastes nasty.

06:21.290 --> 06:24.490
Well, l'm glad you're back in time
to watch the basketball game, honey.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.960
Dad, l don't wanna watch basketball.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.190
Basketball?

06:28.630 --> 06:32.300
l got tickets tonight for the basketball
game, up in the wizard luxury box.

06:32.440 --> 06:33.490
You wanna go, Alex?

06:33.640 --> 06:36.230
- What--? The wizard luxury box?
- Yeah. The wizard luxury box.

06:36.370 --> 06:38.270
You know the scoreboard
over center court?

06:38.410 --> 06:40.430
The wizard luxury box is in that.

06:40.950 --> 06:43.610
That sounds amazing. l have to see it.
Dad, can l go?

06:43.750 --> 06:45.480
Wait. You don't wanna watch
the game with me

06:45.620 --> 06:49.640
but now that Kelbo is gonna take you
to some fantastic wizard box, you wanna?

06:50.890 --> 06:52.720
Well, but l don't think you'll be able to,

06:52.860 --> 06:56.880
because your mother has a lot of stuff
for you to do around the house.

06:57.230 --> 06:58.890
No, l don't.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.520
Of course, she should go.

07:00.660 --> 07:03.000
Sounds like a great way
to spend some time with your uncle.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.670
Great. We gotta get going,
because we gotta beat wizard traffic.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.200
- Oh, wait. Let me get my sweater.
- You're a wizard.

07:09.910 --> 07:11.170
Thanks for reminding me.

07:11.310 --> 07:13.740
Cashemerus-appearus

07:14.910 --> 07:16.350
Soft.

07:17.310 --> 07:21.440
- Hey, that's my sweater.
- Oh, l'm sorry, Mom. Let's talk about it.

07:24.590 --> 07:26.850
Great conversation.

07:32.100 --> 07:35.430
So we're in the scoreboard
and we can see everything and everybody

07:35.570 --> 07:37.000
and they can't see us at all?

07:37.130 --> 07:39.030
Yeah.
That's the beauty of the wizard box.

07:39.170 --> 07:40.430
Except it's got one drawback.

07:40.570 --> 07:42.270
- Time out on the floor,
- Cover your ears.

07:45.410 --> 07:47.240
We're trying to get that removed.

07:47.380 --> 07:50.970
So tell me more about this whole
secret admirer thing with your brother.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.950
- You're the secret admirer.
- Yeah.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.610
For the last three weeks,
l've been dropping notes in his locker

07:55.750 --> 07:59.310
saying that he's cute and sweet,
and a bunch of other stuff he's totally not.

07:59.460 --> 08:01.250
- You won't tell Dad, right?
- Of course not.

08:01.390 --> 08:02.590
lt's a classic gag.

08:02.730 --> 08:04.790
l got a finish for you.
Here's what you do.

08:04.930 --> 08:06.730
You get yourself a genie, all right?

08:06.860 --> 08:09.030
Dress your genie up
like his secret admirer.

08:09.170 --> 08:14.160
The minute he spots the genie,
you capture his soul, put it in a lamp.

08:14.310 --> 08:15.770
l love that one.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.030
l wasn't gonna go that far.

08:18.180 --> 08:20.110
Well, you're young.
You got a lot to learn.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.940
- And l bet you could teach me a lot.
- Of course l could.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.380
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.680
You have so much more fun with magic
than Dad does.

08:26.820 --> 08:30.340
Okay. Here's a good one.
Hold your head like this.

08:30.490 --> 08:32.980
Cranium revolvus

08:37.860 --> 08:40.700
l love that.
l can't wait for our next school assembly.

08:40.830 --> 08:43.490
- And that's the half,
- Cover your ears.

08:44.940 --> 08:46.770
You're the best, Uncle Kelbo.

08:51.540 --> 08:53.100
Hey, what you got there?

08:53.240 --> 08:54.970
l got another note
from my secret admirer.

08:55.110 --> 08:56.310
They're coming every day now.

08:56.450 --> 08:59.210
Wow, that's exciting.
Do you have any idea who it might be?

08:59.350 --> 09:01.220
No. But she's probably pretty cute.

09:01.350 --> 09:05.050
You see, she dots her l's with hearts,
and that always says cute.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.550
And perfume.

09:08.690 --> 09:11.680
Oh, l can't even smell it,
because of my allergies.

09:11.830 --> 09:13.260
Yep, you're someone's dream.

09:13.400 --> 09:16.730
Someone without pets, grass,
or common house dust.

09:16.870 --> 09:19.100
You know, it's too bad
you don't know who she is.

09:19.240 --> 09:22.690
Hey, l got a great plan to figure it out.
l'm gonna--

09:22.840 --> 09:24.570
You don't wanna hear
my stupid plan, do you?

09:24.710 --> 09:26.610
Oh, no, l wanna hear
all about your stupid plan.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.270
Okay.

09:28.780 --> 09:31.870
l'm gonna hide in this trash can
and stake out my locker.

09:32.550 --> 09:35.110
- Brilliant.
- Yep, and Max is gonna help me.

09:35.250 --> 09:36.650
- He's gonna be your lookout?
- No.

09:36.790 --> 09:39.520
He's gonna stop the wrestling team
from shoving Eugene Troobnick

09:39.660 --> 09:41.890
into the trash can
like they do every day at 3.

09:42.030 --> 09:45.550
- l thought Eugene was homeschooled.
- He is. They go home and get him.

09:51.540 --> 09:55.030
Where is she? l don't wanna teach
the magic safety course twice.

09:55.170 --> 09:57.540
We don't wanna hear it once.

09:59.340 --> 10:02.900
Sorry, we're late. But you know
how much l love the Old West.

10:04.010 --> 10:07.250
lt was great. We went on a cattle drive,
and we took turns branding.

10:07.590 --> 10:09.280
Wanna see mine?

10:09.720 --> 10:11.380
Just kidding.

10:12.290 --> 10:15.450
l'm gonna get me a sarsaparilla
and a nice hot bath.

10:16.930 --> 10:19.230
Partner, l'd love me a sarsaparilla.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.350
Whatever that is. l hope it's root beer.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.560
Oh, no, no, no.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.070
No, you were late, young lady,
and we've all been waiting.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.300
And we're about to start
the magic safety lesson.

10:27.440 --> 10:31.140
Did you guys know most wizard accidents
happen within a mile of the home?

10:31.280 --> 10:34.610
That's because some people
have brothers, and they're not accidents.

10:36.250 --> 10:37.540
Daddy, it's okay that l'm late,

10:37.680 --> 10:40.340
because Uncle Kelbo's been teaching me
magic for the last few days.

10:40.480 --> 10:41.880
ln fact, he and l were talking,

10:42.020 --> 10:44.490
and he said that he could be
my wizard trainer instead of you.

10:44.620 --> 10:46.110
- He did?
- l did?

10:46.260 --> 10:48.820
- You did.
- Hold on.

10:49.060 --> 10:50.460
You--

10:55.930 --> 10:57.030
l did?

11:00.940 --> 11:03.500
- Kelbo, was this your idea?
- No.

11:03.640 --> 11:08.770
Usually, when a guy goes to get a glass
and does a spit take, it says, ''Surprise.''

11:09.980 --> 11:12.640
But at the basketball game,
you said you would teach me.

11:12.780 --> 11:16.410
Yeah, but l was talking more about,
like, pranks and things like that.

11:16.550 --> 11:20.220
Oh, like, Dad has those birthday candles
that never blow out.

11:21.130 --> 11:25.430
No, more like 50 wizards' heads
spinning completely around their bodies.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.190
Oh, that's way better
than the burning-candles thing.

11:29.470 --> 11:32.130
But you guys
love the candles with the:

11:32.270 --> 11:33.860
And the:

11:34.000 --> 11:35.600
And the:

11:37.240 --> 11:41.440
Look, l'm honored that you want me to be
your teacher, but that's your dad's job.

11:41.580 --> 11:43.070
Dad's great with Justin and Max,

11:43.210 --> 11:45.840
but l don't think l'm reaching
my full potential with him.

11:46.680 --> 11:49.780
Well, l don't wanna stand in the way
of your full potential.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.550
Maybe Kelbo should teach you.

11:51.690 --> 11:54.210
Maybe you'll actually show up on time
for his lessons.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.290
l will, Dad,
because you know what l was thinking

11:56.430 --> 11:59.120
is that l learn more by doing
than l do by learning.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.530
Then it's done.

12:01.970 --> 12:06.330
Wait a minute. We get to pick
our wizard teachers? Oh, l pick--

12:06.470 --> 12:08.030
Dad.

12:14.580 --> 12:17.480
Excuse us.
We got a reservation for this garbage can.

12:17.610 --> 12:20.520
Oh, this one's full.

12:20.650 --> 12:22.480
There's a stinkier one upstairs.

12:24.390 --> 12:25.910
See you tomorrow at 3, Eugene.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.160
l don't know
how much longer l can hold out.

12:33.300 --> 12:34.630
l'm the one in the trash can.

12:34.770 --> 12:37.790
My leg was asleep, woke up,
and now it's asleep again.

12:38.700 --> 12:41.300
And l'm claustrophobic.

12:41.540 --> 12:44.940
- Someone's coming. l'll act natural.
- Oh, yeah.

12:45.240 --> 12:48.970
Yep, standing here,
being natural, whistling.

12:56.720 --> 12:57.780
Oh, my gosh.

12:59.190 --> 13:00.380
The lunch lady loves you.

13:01.460 --> 13:02.760
lt makes sense.

13:02.890 --> 13:05.230
My milk's always a little bit colder
than everyone else's.

13:05.760 --> 13:06.860
But what are you gonna do?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.330
l'm gonna write her a letter
and tell her l'm flattered

13:09.470 --> 13:12.490
and if l was 20 to 30 years older
and out of options,

13:12.640 --> 13:14.230
maybe our love could flourish.

13:15.840 --> 13:20.140
Okay. Let her down easy.
You don't want warm milk.

13:21.710 --> 13:23.340
Hey, thanks for doing that for me, Doris.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.680
Here's the left-handed mashed potato
scooper you wanted.

13:25.820 --> 13:29.480
Thanks. A lot of people think they're
the same as an ice-cream scooper.

13:29.620 --> 13:32.990
Those people would be wrong.

13:34.790 --> 13:37.690
That was totally an ice-cream scooper.

13:42.630 --> 13:47.040
So that's how you disappear and reappear
ten feet away. Pretty fun, huh?

13:47.170 --> 13:49.370
That's about as magical as walking.

13:53.340 --> 13:56.010
See? What did l tell you?
Not as much fun as poofing in.

13:56.150 --> 13:57.240
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Alex.

13:57.380 --> 13:58.750
You missed a good one today.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.540
We disappeared and then reappeared
ten feet away.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.480
- Wasn't it fun, guys?
- Yeah.

14:03.620 --> 14:07.320
A little more exciting
than that ripening-fruit spell you taught us.

14:08.330 --> 14:12.350
Okay. Well, have a good lesson.
The lair is yours, Kelbo.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.190
Please, leave it how you found it.

14:14.570 --> 14:16.260
Come on, guys.

14:16.530 --> 14:21.060
Oh, hey, Max.
Does anybody want some salted nuts?

14:21.210 --> 14:22.800
Sure, Dad.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.670
Snakes of all different colors.
lt was--

14:32.080 --> 14:36.420
- So, what's our lesson gonna be?
- Oh, l thought we'd take a nap first.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.220
Well, l'll tell you what it's not gonna be,
and that's fruit ripening.

14:41.730 --> 14:42.990
Because it's easy.

14:43.130 --> 14:45.750
All you do is you buy the fruit,
you go into the future,

14:45.900 --> 14:47.300
fruit's ripe, you eat it.

14:47.430 --> 14:51.160
You're gonna teach me about time travel?
l've always wanted to learn that.

14:51.770 --> 14:53.600
Oh, look, the wizard mail's here.

14:55.740 --> 14:58.230
Uncle Kelbo,
can we please focus on the lesson?

14:58.380 --> 14:59.900
Look, we'll read it.

15:00.040 --> 15:05.110
We'll go back in time to before we read it,
and it will be like we haven't even read it.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.580
A sea chimp sample? We used to get
these all the time when we were little.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.080
They're just pets you put in water

15:10.220 --> 15:12.020
and you don't have to feed
or play with them.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.650
They're great. They die before your mom
makes you throw out the smelly water.

15:15.790 --> 15:16.950
Open them up. Come on.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.890
l don't know.
These aren't regular sea chimps.

15:19.030 --> 15:22.090
They came in the wizard mail and Dad
doesn't like us to open the wizard mail.

15:22.230 --> 15:23.600
Some of the stuff
can be dangerous.

15:23.730 --> 15:27.000
Okay, l understand.
But your dad's not your teacher, l am.

15:27.140 --> 15:29.700
And whatever goes wrong,
we can fix with magic.

15:30.670 --> 15:31.900
All right.

15:32.040 --> 15:35.210
But don't you need water
for sea chimps?

15:35.350 --> 15:36.840
Apparently, not.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.380
What--?

15:40.250 --> 15:43.580
That's not gonna work.
Fix it with magic.

15:44.220 --> 15:46.710
Okay, okay, okay. All right. l got it.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.630
Okay. That's what l use in the shower
at cheap motels.

15:56.770 --> 15:59.500
- Sorry.
- Well, use another one.

15:59.640 --> 16:02.330
l can't. l'm panicking.

16:04.010 --> 16:05.870
Guess who l am.

16:08.550 --> 16:12.170
l'm the lunch lady.
l'm in love with Justin.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.940
Give me a kiss, doll face.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.290
Hey, why is Coach Gunderson here?

16:20.790 --> 16:23.390
And why does he look so mad?

16:25.900 --> 16:27.450
Which one of you is Justin Russo?

16:31.600 --> 16:32.900
l think it's you.

16:34.300 --> 16:37.170
You don't shower after gym
because you don't sweat.

16:37.310 --> 16:39.570
Because you walk the mile.

16:40.380 --> 16:41.870
Hey, coach.

16:42.010 --> 16:46.470
What are you doing writing love letters
to my girlfriend, the lunch lady?

16:50.220 --> 16:54.320
She was putting letters in my locker
and l was just trying to let her down gently.

16:54.460 --> 16:56.390
Excuse me. What's going on here?

16:56.530 --> 16:59.930
Your son is trying to tell me
that he's getting love letters

17:00.060 --> 17:02.430
from my girlfriend, the lunch lady.

17:03.930 --> 17:07.960
The lunch lady?
May l see one of these notes?

17:08.109 --> 17:09.369
l have one.

17:12.609 --> 17:15.130
''l love your lightsaber nightlight.''

17:17.380 --> 17:20.540
How would the lunch lady know
you have a lightsaber nightlight?

17:21.619 --> 17:23.480
Alex.

17:25.119 --> 17:28.610
Alex is my 1 4-year-old daughter
and she kind of torments him.

17:29.060 --> 17:31.430
Well, really all of us.

17:31.930 --> 17:33.620
l get it.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.130
You still sleep with a nightlight?

17:36.570 --> 17:38.260
Good.

17:38.440 --> 17:41.460
The dark can be very, very scary.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.800
Keep walking the mile.

17:44.940 --> 17:50.900
And sorry l barked at you.
Lunch lady says l get pretty jealous.

17:57.220 --> 17:58.740
Dad.

18:00.020 --> 18:02.180
- Honey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

18:02.330 --> 18:03.790
l don't know what happened.

18:03.930 --> 18:05.920
l know.
There's water coming out of the lair.

18:06.060 --> 18:07.930
Oh, who's in the lair?

18:08.200 --> 18:10.220
Alex and Kelbo.
They're doing their lesson in there.

18:10.370 --> 18:11.960
Somebody's gotta get into the lair.

18:12.100 --> 18:15.370
We don't know how much water.
lf we open it, it could flood the restaurant.

18:15.510 --> 18:18.800
l know. Hey, you remember the spell
from today, transporting ten feet?

18:18.940 --> 18:20.200
- Come on.
- l'm on it.

18:20.340 --> 18:23.940
Whoa, wait, wait.
l'll be right back.

18:25.150 --> 18:28.050
Okay, okay, l'm ready.
Better safe than sorry.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.350
Justin, get me in there.

18:30.490 --> 18:32.650
Threemetrus-movetrus

18:33.890 --> 18:35.790
Hey, why can l breathe underwater?

18:36.430 --> 18:39.920
lt's due to the fact
that we're sea chimps.

18:40.060 --> 18:42.500
Oh, right. Do something.

18:42.930 --> 18:44.990
Relax. l've been in way worse situations
than this.

18:45.140 --> 18:48.230
lmagine the exact same thing,
except hot lava.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.160
Why were you in hot lava?

18:50.570 --> 18:53.100
Suffice it to say,
l don't know how to make hot coffee.

18:53.640 --> 18:57.010
You opened
the magic sea chimp packet, didn't you?

18:57.150 --> 18:58.510
A little.

18:59.250 --> 19:03.150
l know a spell that will fix this.
Alex, repeat after me.

19:03.290 --> 19:07.150
- l'm a big knucklehead.
- l'm a big knucklehead.

19:07.290 --> 19:08.880
Wait a second, that's not a spell.

19:09.030 --> 19:11.930
No, l know.
l just wanted to hear you admit it.

19:12.330 --> 19:16.460
Hey, if anyone here's a big knucklehead,
it's this sea chimp.

19:17.170 --> 19:20.140
Gee, who knows a spell
that will get us out of this mess?

19:20.270 --> 19:22.260
Anyone? Anyone?

19:22.410 --> 19:24.670
Oh, wait. l do.

19:24.810 --> 19:27.500
All right. Alex, say this:

19:27.640 --> 19:31.240
Dehydratus-lougaines, apus-escapus

19:31.380 --> 19:35.080
Dehydratus-lougaines, apus-escapus

19:38.090 --> 19:39.250
l just don't get it.

19:39.390 --> 19:42.760
Kelbo said that he could fix it,
but he couldn't and Dad could.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.420
But Dad's not even a wizard anymore.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.030
Well, your dad was always
a much better wizard than l was.

19:47.160 --> 19:50.220
That can't be true. Only one wizard
in each family can keep their powers.

19:50.370 --> 19:52.700
lf Dad was the better wizard,
he'd keep his powers.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.630
- You never told them, huh?
- Told us what?

19:56.870 --> 19:59.430
Honey, l think they're old enough.

19:59.580 --> 20:02.340
We're all getting go-carts?

20:04.180 --> 20:05.770
No.

20:08.620 --> 20:12.490
When Kelbo and your father competed
to see who'd keep their wizard powers,

20:13.160 --> 20:15.620
it was your dad who won the contest.

20:16.430 --> 20:17.690
What?

20:17.830 --> 20:22.990
But wizards can't marry non-wizards,
so your dad gave Kelbo his powers

20:23.130 --> 20:25.400
so that he could marry me.

20:28.710 --> 20:31.700
l think that's the sweetest thing
l've ever heard in my life.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.970
Give your powers up for a girl?

20:34.110 --> 20:36.080
- Yeah, right.
- What?

20:38.050 --> 20:39.610
l can't be--

20:40.920 --> 20:42.890
You guys,
if Dad hadn't given up his powers,

20:43.020 --> 20:44.320
none of us would be here.

20:44.450 --> 20:47.950
Yeah, l made the right decision then,
and l stand by it.

20:48.090 --> 20:51.060
And l should've stood by you, Dad.
Will you still be my wizard teacher?

20:51.190 --> 20:54.650
Please, l beg of you, okay?
Take her on.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.200
You know me. l can't handle it.

20:56.330 --> 21:00.130
l get distracted, and then l get careless,
and then--

21:00.270 --> 21:03.430
This towel is so soft.

21:06.380 --> 21:09.070
Oh, and distracted.
You know, l get distracted.

21:09.210 --> 21:11.480
We get it.
Honey, honey, l'll be your teacher.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.010
But you're still my fun Uncle Kelbo.

21:15.150 --> 21:18.610
l mean, who else gets to say that they
were a sea chimp even for a little while?

21:18.760 --> 21:21.020
Actually, everyone l know.

21:22.790 --> 21:24.820
l've made them all open up
that same packet

21:24.960 --> 21:28.620
because l just love the pretty colors
on the outside.

21:30.100 --> 21:32.660
- The basketball game is on.
- Oh, can l watch it with you?

21:33.140 --> 21:34.870
Yes. l'd love that, honey.

21:35.010 --> 21:38.530
Wait, wait, wait. l've got an idea.
We can all watch it.

21:42.080 --> 21:45.010
Yeah! Yeah!

21:46.020 --> 21:47.510
Hey, guys, wanna see something cool?

21:47.650 --> 21:50.140
- Hold your heads like this.
- Oh, what are you talking about?

21:50.290 --> 21:51.980
Cranium revolvus

21:55.260 --> 21:58.490
Oh, this is bunk.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.830
- Okay. You remember what to say, right?
- Yeah.

22:08.970 --> 22:12.870
Excuse me. l was just checking to see
if your refrigerator's running.

22:13.010 --> 22:15.410
As a matter of fact,
my refrigerator is broken.

22:16.810 --> 22:18.840
lt's not running.
What do l do if it's not running?

22:18.980 --> 22:20.380
She's onto us. Run.
