00:39.040 --> 00:42.920
(FAINT GROWLING)

00:42.960 --> 00:44.400
DOCTOR: Great work, guys.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.080
- And sorry again.
- (CREATURE SCREECHES)

00:46.120 --> 00:48.640
I did not know
it was their mating season.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.320
Yes, Graham, my son!
I've got it!

00:50.360 --> 00:51.480
Got what?

00:51.520 --> 00:53.560
The sixth coupon
from the Bandohzi Herald.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.160
Keeps getting delivered
by the coffee machine upstairs.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.200
Or is it downstairs?

00:56.240 --> 01:00.080
Anyway, don't matter.
I noticed they had an offer on.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.720
Collect six coupons,
get a free holiday.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.040
I'm up for a free holiday.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.520
- Where is it?
- A place called Tranquillity.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.120
Me too. So long as
there's plenty of sun

01:08.160 --> 01:10.560
and absolutely
no deep-space squid.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.040
Might get you
out of your mardy mood.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.160
My mood's fine.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.480
- That's you told.
- (WHIRRING)

01:16.520 --> 01:17.960
DOCTOR: Hang on, Graham.
They're not

01:18.000 --> 01:19.160
six perfect squares, are they?

01:19.200 --> 01:20.960
No, don't put them together
yet!

01:21.000 --> 01:22.840
- RYAN: Bit late for that.
- What's happening?

01:22.880 --> 01:24.880
I hope you've packed.
They're not just coupons.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.640
That's a teleport cube -
just activated.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.080
We've got about four seconds.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.040
No, no, no, no. I've got to go
and fetch my Speedos.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.040
Only joking.
Already got 'em on. Ho-ho!

01:38.840 --> 01:41.040
TANNOY:
Welcome to Tranquillity Spa.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.680
Oh, guys! This is a bit
of all right, innit?

01:43.720 --> 01:44.720
Welcome!

01:44.760 --> 01:47.560
O'Brien party of four?

01:47.600 --> 01:49.560
Bandohzi Herald coupons?

01:49.600 --> 01:51.200
I'm Hyph3n with a 3,

01:51.240 --> 01:54.520
your customer host here
at Tranquillity Spa.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.520
And relax!

01:56.560 --> 01:57.920
Hi, Hyph3n with a 3. Nice tail.

01:57.960 --> 02:00.520
I'm a bit worried about
being separated from my ship.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.120
Our system has saved
exactly where you came from.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.640
You can return any time, but
you're booked in for two weeks,

02:05.680 --> 02:07.080
all-inclusive.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.120
Get in!

02:08.160 --> 02:10.120
Your rooms
are just being prepared.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.560
Take a moment to explore

02:11.600 --> 02:13.520
and I'll come and find you
once they're ready.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.000
I'm going to find the pool!

02:15.040 --> 02:16.760
I'm seeing what they've got
inside the building.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.960
And I am going to sit
over there for three hours,

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
then I'm going to get up
and sit somewhere else,

02:23.040 --> 02:24.960
and then cocktails.
All-inclusive, Doc.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.400
Got to get your coupons' worth.
Get in!

02:27.440 --> 02:29.680
Come on, Graham, son!

02:29.720 --> 02:31.640
I'll have a look round, then.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.360
By myself.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.000
Relax.
Our staff are being informed.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.040
(ALARM BEEPS)

02:46.080 --> 02:47.520
- Another system virus.
- Vorm, I don't care.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.920
We've got a physical breach.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.360
One of them's got in.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.280
Find it, contain it,
and radio in.

02:53.320 --> 02:54.320
Do not engage without me.

03:01.360 --> 03:04.560
Look at that, Vilma.
Can you believe it?

03:04.600 --> 03:07.280
Oh, it's perfect, Benni.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.920
Thank you.

03:08.960 --> 03:12.200
BENNI: I saw some newlyweds
up at reception.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.160
Nice place to come
for a honeymoon.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.920
We've had 46 years.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.720
We never needed to be married.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.760
You say that...

03:20.800 --> 03:21.840
...but...

03:21.880 --> 03:23.200
Wow!

03:23.240 --> 03:26.120
- BENNI: Oh, hello.
- VILMA: Not bad, is it?

03:26.160 --> 03:27.760
It's absolutely gorgeous.

03:27.800 --> 03:28.920
Um...

03:28.960 --> 03:30.280
YAZ: This place
has got everything.

03:31.640 --> 03:36.040
Welcome to Tranquillity's bar
and refreshment zone.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.800
We serve all your favourites,
all-inclusive.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.280
Oh, free stuff!

03:43.400 --> 03:44.800
- (NUMBER PAD BEEPS)
- Ooh

03:44.840 --> 03:46.600
- (FIZZING)
- Ow! Ow!

03:46.640 --> 03:48.080
Fighting with
the vending machine?

03:48.120 --> 03:49.760
No, it just gave me
an electric shock.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.320
That's not a shock.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.880
It's a hopper virus.

03:52.920 --> 03:53.720
This machine's sick,

03:53.760 --> 03:55.200
and it just passed its virus on
to you.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.960
How did I get a virus the same
as a vending machine?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.040
I'm not a machine.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.200
Hoppers are multi-platform.
They'll go for anything.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.040
- Don't pick at it!
- Did it just go through me?

04:02.080 --> 04:03.080
It's moving deeper inside you

04:03.120 --> 04:04.400
to mutate
into your nervous system.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.440
What?

04:05.480 --> 04:06.560
Important not to panic.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.520
Humans always have the same
reaction to a hopper virus.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.840
First you get
the wiggly fingers,

04:09.880 --> 04:11.600
which is a warning
the legs are about to go.

04:11.640 --> 04:12.440
Luckily,

04:12.480 --> 04:14.320
this is where my hopper
first-aid training kicks in.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.960
Need to get rid of these.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.120
Then pinch your ear.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.120
- Then you're going to sneeze.
- Atchoo!

04:22.160 --> 04:26.200
Yes! Now suck your thumb
until the hallucinations stop.

04:26.240 --> 04:29.120
And remember,
they're not real bats.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.440
- (RYAN SQUEALS)
- He's fine.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.080
He's fine.

04:34.760 --> 04:35.920
Make the bats go away!

04:35.960 --> 04:37.200
Hotel perimeter breach.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.320
Initiating guest
protection measures.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.560
It's on the move again, Vorm.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.720
Be careful.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.880
I'm Vilma. Nice to meet you.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.320
This is Benni.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.600
Yaz. Just arrived.

04:48.640 --> 04:49.720
Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.880
- Oh, you're all right...
- Well, you were a bit...

04:51.920 --> 04:54.600
All guests, please assemble
at your nearest muster station.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.360
Relax.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.280
This is a routine
Tranquillity drill.

04:59.320 --> 05:02.520
All guests, please assemble
at your nearest muster station.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.680
If this is anything to do
with you, Doc...

05:04.720 --> 05:05.760
Relax.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.280
This is a routine
Tranquillity drill.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.920
Stay here. I'll investigate.
It's probably nothing.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.600
Usually nothing.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.400
I say "usually"...

05:13.440 --> 05:18.120
All guests, please assemble
at your nearest muster station.

05:18.160 --> 05:22.600
The nearest muster station to
this zone is the teleport pad.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.720
Hopper virus got you too?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.280
I'm not sure about this place.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.520
So...

05:34.560 --> 05:35.880
...you here with family?

05:38.880 --> 05:40.320
Hotel critic.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.000
Mm.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.080
You?

05:43.120 --> 05:46.560
Oh, I'm here with my mates,
yeah.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.920
I'm a pilot...surgeon...
pilot...surgeon...

05:48.960 --> 05:50.960
I'm a surgeon for pilots.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.120
So, do you come across
many hopper viruses?

05:55.160 --> 05:56.800
Does this usually work?

05:56.840 --> 05:58.360
- What?
- Pretending to be stupid

05:58.400 --> 05:59.840
so girls have to answer
your questions?

05:59.880 --> 06:02.320
Hey, look, I'm not
trying to chat you up.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.520
Shame.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.840
I'm Bella.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.240
Oh...

06:13.280 --> 06:14.520
VORM: Heading to the east zone.

06:14.560 --> 06:15.920
I'll isolate it there.

06:17.760 --> 06:21.360
If this is a drill,
what's he doing with a gun?

06:23.640 --> 06:25.320
Do you want to find out?

06:26.920 --> 06:30.080
Relax. This is a routine
Tranquillity drill.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.560
Coming up to linen cupboard
now.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.280
Hyph3n with a 3!

06:33.320 --> 06:35.640
I just pulled this
out of a friend of mine.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.200
Well, we do not make any
judgments on our guests

06:38.240 --> 06:40.480
and fully support any way
you choose to enjoy yourself

06:40.520 --> 06:41.640
here at Tranquillity Spa.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.000
It wasn't recreational.
This is a weapon.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.680
I'd say someone
is targeting you.

06:45.720 --> 06:46.920
Now, why would they do that?

06:46.960 --> 06:49.040
Also, why is that alarm
going off?

06:49.080 --> 06:50.240
And why do you look
so concerned?

06:50.280 --> 06:51.840
Also, where does the 3
come in "Hyphen"?

06:51.880 --> 06:53.560
Never mind. That one can wait.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.120
Also... Also,
what's behind that door?

06:56.160 --> 06:57.680
Cos no linen cupboard
needs a key

06:57.720 --> 06:59.400
with that many
security gradings.

06:59.440 --> 07:00.440
I want to take a look.

07:00.480 --> 07:03.240
Guests aren't permitted
in the...linen cupboard.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.920
How about...

07:04.960 --> 07:07.800
...Pan-galactic Standards
and Practices Officer?

07:07.840 --> 07:09.480
Health and Safety?

07:09.520 --> 07:11.840
Security and Hygiene?

07:11.880 --> 07:13.000
Resort Inspector?

07:13.040 --> 07:15.680
Now, are you
and your excellent tail

07:15.720 --> 07:17.000
going to let me have a look,

07:17.040 --> 07:19.600
or am I going to have
to bark at you? Cos I will.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
(BEEP)

07:23.040 --> 07:24.880
It's after the second H
and before the final N.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.760
- The 3.
- Oh, yeah!

07:26.800 --> 07:28.080
Course.

07:31.240 --> 07:34.080
Deadlocked room
with its own armoury.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.800
Don't tell me. Honeymoon suite?

07:36.840 --> 07:38.600
Hyph3n, what the hell
are you doing?

07:38.640 --> 07:39.520
Who's this?

07:39.560 --> 07:42.280
I'm the Doctor, and you, madam,
are far too handsy.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.400
Resort Inspector.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.920
We've only just been inspected.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.280
Well, we like to surprise.
Just like this hopper virus

07:47.320 --> 07:48.680
I found
in your vending machine.

07:48.720 --> 07:51.520
This will mutate any system
it hops into and wreck it.

07:51.560 --> 07:52.880
This is part of a family set,

07:52.920 --> 07:56.000
so there are other replications
out there, which might explain

07:56.040 --> 07:57.960
why your ionic membrane's
failed.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.560
Why would you need
to defend a holiday spa

08:01.600 --> 08:04.000
with an ionic membrane?

08:04.040 --> 08:05.240
(DOOR UNLOCKS)

08:05.280 --> 08:07.880
Power systems
in this zone of Tranquillity

are currently
experiencing challenges.

(CLATTERING)

08:13.400 --> 08:15.000
(GROWLING)

08:15.040 --> 08:16.520
Help me!

08:16.560 --> 08:19.000
- Relax, and leave immediately.
- Please!

08:19.040 --> 08:20.720
- Please!
- Confirmed sighting.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.240
It's on the loose inside.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.720
(SNARLING)

08:23.760 --> 08:25.760
It's attacking the guests.

08:25.800 --> 08:29.080
What did he say?
What's attacking the guests?

08:29.120 --> 08:30.760
Why do you need all this?
Tell me.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.320
Do not engage. I'm en route.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.280
We have to implement
teleport evacuation procedures.

08:34.320 --> 08:35.720
Don't tell me about
the procedures, Hyph3n.

08:35.760 --> 08:36.760
I wrote them.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.320
You can forget
about evacuation.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.480
The hopper virus
is in your teleport system.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.480
Everything's down.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.640
I need you here to help me
understand this place,

08:43.680 --> 08:46.240
not out there
shooting at things.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.360
This zone of Tranquillity
is compromised.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.240
If you can hear this message,
you shouldn't be here.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.000
Leave immediately.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.080
- (SNARLS)
- Stay back!

(ELECTRICAL FIZZING)

09:05.960 --> 09:08.760
Kane, there's more than one.
I have to retreat!

09:08.800 --> 09:10.400
(SNARLING)

09:11.400 --> 09:13.440
- RYAN: Something's down there.
- BELLA: In here.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.240
Good, here we go.
You're maintenance, right?

09:16.280 --> 09:17.480
You're just the fella.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.400
You are needed outside.

09:20.440 --> 09:21.680
Some of the guests reckon that

09:21.720 --> 09:23.000
the teleport on the terrace
ain't working.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.840
Yeah, nothing's working,
mate, sorry.

09:25.880 --> 09:27.760
Where's my snap hammer?

09:27.800 --> 09:29.720
Sylas?

09:29.760 --> 09:32.640
Snap hammer won't fix that.
You want a crash wrench.

09:32.680 --> 09:35.720
Oi, you're not a mechanic.
You're a child.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.360
Now pass me the snap hammer.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.880
I'm Nevi. This is my boy Sylas.

09:39.920 --> 09:40.960
All right, Sylas?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.720
Yeah, he likes to show up
without warning.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.800
This place is way better
than Mum's house.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.400
How many people
have you got staying here?

09:47.440 --> 09:49.960
23. This shows
all their positions.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.520

09:59.120 --> 10:00.720
Our friends are out there.

10:00.760 --> 10:03.360
All guests
within the hotel building,

10:03.400 --> 10:06.240
to the linen cupboard in
the north corridor immediately.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.360
It's just a drill.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.480
Not a drill.

10:09.520 --> 10:10.800
Repeat, not a drill.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.200
I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.640

10:18.680 --> 10:21.400
We should probably
head to the linen cupboard.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.080
DOCTOR:
Where's your security team?

10:25.120 --> 10:26.840
KANE: No team.
Just me and Vorm.

(SNARLING)

10:27.840 --> 10:31.160
This zone of Tranquillity

Please do not enter
the Tranquillity steam room

10:33.800 --> 10:35.440

- It's seen me!

10:38.720 --> 10:40.640
- What...?
- BELLA: Shut up!

10:40.680 --> 10:42.560
Welcome to the Tranquillity

Please leave immediately.

10:59.160 --> 11:03.360
An unauthorised life form
has entered the steam room.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.280
This debug script should
neutralise the hopper viruses,

11:07.320 --> 11:08.600
but they'll need time to work.

11:08.640 --> 11:12.120
More urgently, I need to build
a new ionic membrane

11:12.160 --> 11:13.960
to banish whatever is killing
your guests.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.400
You can't build an ionic
membrane from scratch.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.960
If I had crayons
and half a can of Spam,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.040
I could build you from scratch.
Now, out of my way.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.480
HYPH3N: They'll take
the bodies, won't they?

11:25.520 --> 11:28.440
There you are. We heard the
Doctor's voice over the Tannoy.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.600
Also gunfire.
And people screaming.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.280
Yeah, I know.
I've been on better holidays.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.640
All of you, in here.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.960
That's a funny kind
of linen cupboard.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.600
Hi, can't talk. Building.

Kane, I'm sorry.
I couldn't stop it.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.440
It's your job to stop it, Vorm.

12:01.240 --> 12:04.840
VORM: Those things are heading
for the guest teleport.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.400
Benni, I dropped my hat.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.000
Where's Benni?

12:13.040 --> 12:15.040
And where's Ryan?

restored to 20.5%.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.160
The ionic membrane's
forced those things out.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.840
Now open the door.
Our friend's out there.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.520
What are those red dots?

13:36.120 --> 13:37.400
I'm so sorry.

VILMA: Yaz, I can't see Benni
on there either.

Ryan! Ryan!

13:59.000 --> 14:00.280
- Graham.
- Oh!

14:00.320 --> 14:02.200
What's happening?

14:02.240 --> 14:03.880
Oh, Ryan!

14:03.920 --> 14:05.920
It ain't the aliens
that are gonna kill me,

14:05.960 --> 14:07.360
it's worrying about you.

14:08.920 --> 14:11.120
DOCTOR: What is it
that got in here?

14:11.160 --> 14:12.640
KANE: A couple of the locals.
Dregs.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.120
They're always trying
to attack.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.360
That's why we have shields.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.200
But the virus that brought
the shields down,

14:17.240 --> 14:18.760
the Dregs couldn't have
done that.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.080
Somebody hacked the system.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.640
RYAN: Who'd sabotage a hotel?

14:21.680 --> 14:24.320
KANE: Vorm, void panel SE9-13.

right now?

- RYAN: Ooh.

14:35.680 --> 14:38.560
Cor blimey! Right on me nut!

14:38.600 --> 14:40.320
Am I having a stroke
or something?

14:40.360 --> 14:41.800
- It's a fake-cation.
- GRAHAM: A what?

14:41.840 --> 14:42.960
A really good one.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
What? So none of this is real?

14:45.040 --> 14:47.920
The hotel is, and the pool.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.000
But you reach
a certain point...

14:50.040 --> 14:51.000
(KNOCKS)

14:51.040 --> 14:55.120
These are usually built in
cities so no-one has to travel.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.840
Our guests now get
off-world holiday

14:56.880 --> 14:57.920
for a fraction of the price.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.720
If they survive.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.600
You built this somewhere
you shouldn't,

15:01.640 --> 15:02.800
thinking no-one'd notice

15:02.840 --> 15:05.440
if you could only get
in and out by teleport.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.520
I heard your little chat
about O2 levels.

15:07.560 --> 15:08.960
That's a completely
different environment

15:09.000 --> 15:10.400
out there. The native species

15:10.440 --> 15:12.360
want you and your guests dead.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.880
Doctor, you need to see this!

15:14.920 --> 15:17.000
They've built a wall
all around this hotel.

15:17.040 --> 15:19.440
Vilma said it's the first
off-world fake-cation.

15:19.480 --> 15:22.520
Done that bit. Feel the lump
on my bonce. Do that.

15:22.560 --> 15:25.160
- What?
- But my Benni is missing.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.280
According to this,
he's outside the shields.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.920
You can't just walk outside.
There's not enough oxygen.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.200
He'd be dead
before we reach him.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.720
He has an oxygen tank.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.160
We have to find him.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.360
He came here because of you.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.920
If there's even the slightest
chance of finding him,

15:40.960 --> 15:42.680
you need to do it. We'll help.

15:42.720 --> 15:45.720
Get transport. I'll gather
everyone in the bar.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.080
Now, Kane!

15:56.240 --> 15:59.840
You get one O2 canister each.
Conserve it.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.560
Green is good, orange is bad,
red's dead.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.840
Oh...

16:03.880 --> 16:05.600
The good news -
these are smart.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.840
In an O2-rich environment,
they refill themselves.

16:07.880 --> 16:09.880
Outside this dome,
the only O2-rich environment

16:09.920 --> 16:12.080
on the planet
will be inside the truck.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.480
Do not exit
without my permission.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.600
Keep an eye on your readings.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.560
They'll change colour if you
are running low on oxygen.

16:19.600 --> 16:23.880
Nevi, cockle, my nose thingy
and this breathing apparatus,

16:23.920 --> 16:24.920
is it on right?

16:24.960 --> 16:26.000
Yeah, it's fine.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.560
Dad, it-it's not right.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.760
(BEEPING)

16:28.800 --> 16:30.280
We'd better go
and fire up the truck.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.040
- SYLAS: Yeah.
- I built it myself.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.120
Good.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.360
Tell me
you helped him build it.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.560
KANE: We're moving out!

16:38.920 --> 16:40.280
You owe me some answers.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.600
This is my operation.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.600
Well, it's clearly going well.
What planet is this?

16:43.640 --> 16:45.000
Orphan 55.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.960
You built a fake-cation on
an orphan planet? Are you mad?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.480
The radiation's dropped.
It's safe in short spells.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.960
Get in the truck.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.560
Always remain
inside the vehicle.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.720
This vehicle is the property
of Tranquillity Spa,

17:01.760 --> 17:03.880
your home from home.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.680
RYAN: Was we inside that?

17:09.720 --> 17:11.400
YAZ: This whole planet
looks dead.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.480
It is. It's an orphan planet.

17:14.520 --> 17:17.520
It's a grading that means
it's become too toxic for life.

17:17.560 --> 17:18.760
We're not safe out here.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.760
GRAHAM: Well, we weren't
exactly safe in there.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.800
Come on, Doc, explain. Why
is it called an orphan planet?

17:30.840 --> 17:33.080
DOCTOR: Because it's
uninhabitable. In societies

17:33.120 --> 17:35.720
that let this happen, there's
nearly always a ruling elite

17:35.760 --> 17:38.680
that gets to evacuate, and then
signs off all responsibility

17:38.720 --> 17:40.440
for whatever
they've left behind.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.520
That's messed up.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.080
Happens more than you think.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.000
This is Orphan 55.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.640
And if you can't evacuate?

17:46.680 --> 17:50.440
You die.
All sentient life dies.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.960
That's how it gets the grading.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.960
Except on Orphan 55,
something clearly survived.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.200
RYAN: The Dregs.

17:56.240 --> 17:59.120
Why here, Kane?
Why build this hotel?

17:59.160 --> 18:00.600
It doesn't make any sense.

18:00.640 --> 18:01.800
The air's unbreathable,

18:01.840 --> 18:03.640
but a few years
with the right terraforming,

18:03.680 --> 18:05.760
we can reduce the CO2 and make
the whole planet habitable.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.880
Terraforming
bankrolled by fake-cation.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.200
Smart.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.760
Today hotelier, tomorrow...

18:11.800 --> 18:14.480
...the proud owner
of Orphan 55,

18:14.520 --> 18:16.720
the best real estate
in the galaxy.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.160
If you can sort out your
Dreg problem, you'll be rich.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.920
(TRACKER BEEPS)

18:20.960 --> 18:23.880
Hey, Doc.
Benni's changed direction.

18:23.920 --> 18:26.440
VILMA: Why would he do that?

18:29.320 --> 18:31.680
Maybe he's heading back
to the dome.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.720
- Abort the mission.
- (BRAKES SCREECH)

18:35.760 --> 18:37.400
He's alive!
We know where he is!

18:37.440 --> 18:40.400
He's moving at
37 clicks an hour.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.360
That doesn't
sound like my Benni.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.200
The Dregs got him. We abort.

18:44.240 --> 18:49.360
If those things have got Benni,
we're getting him back!

18:49.400 --> 18:52.440
You want money, Kane?
That's worth a fortune!

18:52.480 --> 18:53.960
BELLA: That would buy
a lot of terraforming.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.760
Or don't you want to be Queen
of Orphan 55 any more, Kane?

18:56.800 --> 18:59.720
DOCTOR: Never mind the money,
there's a man's life at stake.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.840
Vorm, follow the tracker.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.360
- (VEHICLE STARTS)
- Oh...

19:13.000 --> 19:16.480
External oxygen levels - 2%.

19:16.520 --> 19:20.080
Current internal
oxygen levels - 21%.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.440
Always remain in...

19:21.480 --> 19:23.760
So what do you actually
know about the Dregs?

19:23.800 --> 19:25.440
How many are there?

19:25.480 --> 19:27.400
...is the property
of Tranquillity Spa.

19:28.840 --> 19:31.040
Don't want to talk to me? Fine.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.520
I don't need a second person
for a conversation.

19:32.560 --> 19:35.240
A lot of the time
they just get in the way. So...

19:35.280 --> 19:38.560
A Dreg is a native species
that somehow lived

19:38.600 --> 19:40.520
through the fallout.

19:40.560 --> 19:43.400
That's generations.
There must be a few of them.

19:43.440 --> 19:46.040
Hyph3n with a 3,
your face tells me I'm right.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.760
But how did they survive?

19:49.160 --> 19:52.680
And why is your gun fitted
with an exciplex modulator?

19:52.720 --> 19:54.680
They randomise laser output.

19:56.040 --> 19:57.840
You'd only need that
against a thing

19:57.880 --> 19:59.560
that could adapt
to your attack.

20:01.320 --> 20:02.680
Hang on.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.120
That's what they do?

20:06.160 --> 20:07.640
Adapt?

20:07.680 --> 20:10.520
To guns and to nuclear winter?!

20:10.560 --> 20:13.200
Apex predators! And we...
We are driving

20:13.240 --> 20:15.160
straight into their territory!

20:15.200 --> 20:17.240
(WIND HOWLS)

20:19.040 --> 20:22.440
(SNARLS)

20:22.480 --> 20:24.680
(ALL SNARL)

20:36.080 --> 20:37.600
So, er...

20:40.680 --> 20:43.240
...how long
have you been unemployed?

20:44.520 --> 20:46.760
Is that the worst chat-up line
ever?

20:48.480 --> 20:50.000
Yeah.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.760
You just witnessed history.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.680
I've been unemployed
for a month.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.680
I was my dad's carer,
but...he died.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.720
Oh. Sorry.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.320
I lost my mum eight years back.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.840
Have you got anyone else?
Is your mum around?

21:14.880 --> 21:17.640
She died
when I was about Sylas's age.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.920
She made Nevi look like
Parent of the Year.

21:21.440 --> 21:24.200
So...guys...

21:24.240 --> 21:26.120
...what's going on?

21:28.160 --> 21:29.840
Just talking.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.800
- Having a conversation.
- Great.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.880
Where are we up to?

21:33.920 --> 21:37.480
Yeah, Ryan.
What are you talking about?

21:39.040 --> 21:42.520
Er, er, we both have
dead parents.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.040
(BANG!)

21:44.080 --> 21:46.760
This vehicle is experiencing
momentary difficulties.

21:46.800 --> 21:50.560
This vehicle is experiencing
momentary difficulties.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.280
(CRACKLING) This vehicle
is compromised.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.320
What the hell was that?

21:57.360 --> 22:00.720
This vehicle is compromised.

22:00.760 --> 22:04.240
Please stay inside the vehicle
and wait for assistance.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.520
DOCTOR: This is a trap,
presumably set by the Dregs.

22:06.560 --> 22:08.320
This mist is highly toxic,

22:08.360 --> 22:10.480
and when it clears,
direct sunlight is worse.

22:10.520 --> 22:13.360
We get ten minutes
of solar blistering and then...

22:13.400 --> 22:14.680
...death.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.280
Solar blistering?
What a lovely phrase.

22:18.320 --> 22:19.360
Here's another one.

22:19.400 --> 22:22.000
Completely knackered vehicle.
We're stranded.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.640
KANE: I need to check
where we are.

22:23.680 --> 22:26.920
(GROWLING)

22:26.960 --> 22:29.080
KANE: There's a service tunnel
close by.

22:29.120 --> 22:32.240
If we can make it to that,
we might live.

22:32.280 --> 22:34.280
OK. Bad news is,
we have to leave the truck

22:34.320 --> 22:35.320
and head out on foot.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.280
Not ideal,
but basically our only option.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.400
We can't leave! I paid you.

22:40.440 --> 22:42.280
We came here for Benni!

22:42.320 --> 22:43.920
Stay quiet, move fast.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.640
VILMA: Kane! Kane!

22:45.680 --> 22:46.720
RYAN: All right, let's go.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.400
We'll find him, Vilma,
I promise.

22:55.480 --> 22:58.400
KANE: Tunnel entrance
is just past this ridge.

23:02.920 --> 23:05.560
Benni! Benni! Where are you?

23:05.600 --> 23:06.880
- Shh, shh!
- Oh...

23:06.920 --> 23:08.040
DOCTOR: You'll bring the Dregs.

23:08.080 --> 23:11.160
They're massing
in the hills all around us.

23:11.200 --> 23:14.440
(GROWLING)

23:15.520 --> 23:17.160

Doc, we don't stand a chance.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.320
(SNARLING)

23:25.240 --> 23:28.200
Everyone,
back to the truck! Now!

23:28.240 --> 23:29.560
Go, go!

23:31.120 --> 23:34.000
(SNARLING)

23:35.200 --> 23:36.320
NEVI: So what's the plan now?

23:36.360 --> 23:37.880
KANE: Shut...up.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.600
(GROWLING)

23:50.320 --> 23:51.280
What are we going to do?

23:51.320 --> 23:53.200
KANE: Vorm, we're going to
deal with the Dregs.

23:53.240 --> 23:56.920
Doctor, get them out,
head east, look for a hatch.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.160
We'll keep them busy.

24:00.200 --> 24:01.720
- BENNI: Vilma.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.400

24:04.440 --> 24:05.880
BENNI: Are you in there?

24:05.920 --> 24:07.880
Benni?

24:07.920 --> 24:10.120
- Benni!
- Shh!

24:10.160 --> 24:12.800
- Benni!
- Shh-shh.

24:12.840 --> 24:14.040

24:15.640 --> 24:18.080
BENNI: Vilma!

24:18.120 --> 24:20.640
I can't believe you came!

24:20.680 --> 24:23.760
I'm not alone,
and I don't have long...

24:23.800 --> 24:25.080
(GROWLING)

24:25.120 --> 24:28.280
...but I-I have two questions.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.680
I'm sorry to ask them together.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.760
Will you marry me?

24:33.800 --> 24:37.680
Oh, of course I will!

24:37.720 --> 24:40.280
Yes!

24:40.320 --> 24:42.040
What was the other one?

24:42.080 --> 24:43.160
If anyone can,

24:43.200 --> 24:45.280
will they please shoot me?

24:45.320 --> 24:48.360
- (GROWLING)
- Oh, Benni!

24:48.400 --> 24:50.840
What has it done to you?

24:50.880 --> 24:53.640
(SNARLING)

24:53.680 --> 24:55.400
We've got to get out of here.

24:55.440 --> 24:58.040
We shouldn't
have left the dome.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.720

- It threw me.

25:32.920 --> 25:34.360
- Are you OK?
- They've got Vorm!

25:34.400 --> 25:35.960
(SNARLING AND SCREAMING)

25:36.000 --> 25:37.800
Get me back up there!

25:37.840 --> 25:39.560
You can't fight any more.

25:39.600 --> 25:40.800
Vorm needs me.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.720
We need you. You know this
planet. Get us to the tunnels.

even hotter down here?

26:12.960 --> 26:14.400

26:14.440 --> 26:16.360
Dad, we're doing oxygen checks.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.600
As green as the hair
on our heads, Sylas.

26:18.640 --> 26:19.720
KANE: We're safe.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.440
There's a short-range
maintenance teleport here,

26:21.480 --> 26:23.240
which should just get us
back to base.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.560
Stay close. There's only
enough power for one use.

26:25.600 --> 26:28.920
Kane, when you were fighting
the Dreg,

26:28.960 --> 26:30.760
did you see Benni?

26:30.800 --> 26:32.080
Yeah.

26:32.120 --> 26:33.840
Don't worry. I killed him.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.080
Oh!

26:35.120 --> 26:37.160
GRAHAM: What did you just say?

26:37.200 --> 26:38.400
Benni?

26:38.440 --> 26:40.280
He asked me to.

26:40.320 --> 26:42.120
Oh!

26:42.160 --> 26:45.440
How...? How could you?!

26:45.480 --> 26:47.800
Come on. Come on, Vilma.
I got you.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.000
What is wrong with you?

26:50.040 --> 26:51.800
Why didn't the Dreg kill him?

26:51.840 --> 26:53.080
He was having fun.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.040
There's a room down there
where I stashed a medipack.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.640
Fetch it
and we can get out of here.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.920
You're not getting
out of anywhere.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.560
Bella!

27:00.600 --> 27:04.520
- What are you doing?
- Shut up! I will shoot you.

27:06.520 --> 27:08.440
Where's the maintenance
teleport, Kane?

27:08.480 --> 27:10.000
I'd rather die than tell you.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.440
Oh, you're going to die.

27:11.480 --> 27:13.360
It's just whether
I shoot and kill you now

27:13.400 --> 27:15.000
or wound you
and leave you to the Dregs.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.320
What is it you want?

27:16.360 --> 27:19.080
To burn everything
you've built to the ground.

27:19.120 --> 27:20.400
Who are you?

27:21.600 --> 27:22.920
Me?

27:22.960 --> 27:24.200
Now I'm no-one.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.680
I was my dad's carer.

27:26.800 --> 27:30.520
Bella...why are you
doing this?

27:30.560 --> 27:33.280
My mum didn't really die.

27:33.320 --> 27:36.240
She just never came
to any of my birthdays.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.400
She didn't come to his funeral.

27:38.440 --> 27:41.160
And she doesn't even
recognise me now.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.280
Trixabelle...

27:45.320 --> 27:47.920
Oh! And she gave me
the name Trixabelle.

27:50.440 --> 27:52.480
The teleport's behind you.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.160
DOCTOR: Oh!

27:56.200 --> 27:58.280
Come on!

27:59.600 --> 28:01.840
This is not the way
to resolve a family dispute.

28:01.880 --> 28:05.040
How about good old-fashioned
passive-aggressive discussion?

28:05.080 --> 28:07.240
(SNARLING)

28:12.120 --> 28:13.920

28:20.600 --> 28:22.240

28:22.280 --> 28:25.120
- I didn't ask you to do that!
- You're welcome.

28:25.160 --> 28:26.800
We need to find a way
to help the others get back.

28:26.840 --> 28:29.080
No. They can sort
themselves out.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.800
Hey, hey, hey.
These people are my family.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.160
We're finding a way.

28:34.200 --> 28:37.880
Too late. I'm here
to burn this place down,

28:37.920 --> 28:41.160
and if you're not with me,
you'll die here too.

28:41.200 --> 28:43.600
Our staff are aware. Relax.

28:46.200 --> 28:48.520
- Hang on, where's Ryan?
- With Bella.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.360
Hopefully,
the maintenance teleport

28:50.400 --> 28:51.480
has got them back to the hotel.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.680
OK, listen up.
There's stairs just beyond here

28:54.720 --> 28:56.480
that will take us down
and back.

28:56.520 --> 28:58.280
Just one catch - the route
goes through a Dreg nest.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.880
That's madness!
We'll never make it through!

29:21.360 --> 29:23.200
I didn't know she was here.

29:24.560 --> 29:27.680
So you left her and her dad
and never got back in contact?

29:27.720 --> 29:29.920
You don't get to judge me.

29:29.960 --> 29:32.600
This project, Tranquillity Spa,

29:32.640 --> 29:35.200
I was only doing it
to give to her.

YAZ: Maybe you should
have mentioned that

29:38.440 --> 29:39.720
before you pulled a gun on her.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.520
RYAN: OK, we're not really
going to burn this place down,

29:44.560 --> 29:46.560
- are we?
- Nope.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.360
We're blowing it up.

What?

That looks like Russian.

I'll put it somewhere

to isolate...

31:55.880 --> 31:57.320
You can't blow this place up!

I've spent my whole life
wondering about her,

31:59.840 --> 32:02.320
and she's never thought once
about me!

you're doing it wrong.

They're massing for an attack.

And the ionic membrane's down,
so they can all get in.

37:09.480 --> 37:10.600
We need to evacuate.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.880
We are on phantom power
and the teleport is dead,

37:12.920 --> 37:14.680
but it still knows where
each one of us came from.

37:14.720 --> 37:16.680
Nevi, you need to fix
the teleport.

37:16.720 --> 37:17.720
No way, no, I'm...

You're the only one who knows
how to fix that thing.

37:19.880 --> 37:20.920
And if it doesn't work,

37:20.960 --> 37:22.720
we're all going to be stuck
on this planet.

37:22.760 --> 37:24.560
The bounce capacitor
is completely blown

37:24.600 --> 37:27.320
and the only fuel
we've got left is syrillium 3,

37:27.360 --> 37:29.560
which isn't enough to get us
off-planet.

37:29.600 --> 37:32.040
For that we need syrillium 4.

37:32.080 --> 37:36.120
Which is what...syrillium 3
mutates into

37:36.160 --> 37:38.680

by the hopper virus.

We're all going to die here.

Not if I've got anything
to do with it.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.600

37:57.640 --> 37:59.720
We have one advantage
over them.

37:59.760 --> 38:02.120
Oxygen. We love it.
The Dregs hate it.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.280
This whole dome
is air-conditioned.

38:04.320 --> 38:07.480
If I can up the oxygen levels,
the Dregs will be weakened

...get on it.

41:02.920 --> 41:07.360
You need carbon dioxide
to convert into oxygen

41:07.400 --> 41:09.360
so you can breathe.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.520
We need oxygen
to make carbon dioxide.

41:12.560 --> 41:15.760
Right now we've got
a perfect ecosystem.

41:15.800 --> 41:18.960
Kill us, and you die too.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.720
Sorry. This was a trap and
you walked into it, Wheezy.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.800
- Step back.
- (GROWLS)

41:23.840 --> 41:26.120
And let us out of that door.

41:26.160 --> 41:28.360
It's the only way
you're gonna live.

41:28.400 --> 41:31.240
(ROARS)

41:31.280 --> 41:34.960
The people who used to have
this planet could have changed,

41:35.000 --> 41:36.320
but they didn't,

41:36.360 --> 41:38.840
so they lost everything.

41:40.200 --> 41:43.680
Be smarter than what made you.

41:43.720 --> 41:45.320
(GROWLS)

41:48.400 --> 41:49.880
Step away.

41:57.160 --> 41:58.880
Good Drag. Smart Dreg.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.480
Ready?

42:10.760 --> 42:12.240
(GROWLS)

42:12.280 --> 42:15.200
The second you open that door,
it's going to kill us.

42:15.240 --> 42:17.560
I'm not gonna open the door
until it's in the cage.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.080
I'm hoping it understands that.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.360
(GROWLS)

42:22.800 --> 42:24.760
(GROWLS)

42:35.920 --> 42:37.760
Run. Run, run, run, run, run!

42:40.680 --> 42:42.960
(SNARLS)

42:43.000 --> 42:44.640
YAZ: You let Bella
set this bomb?

42:44.680 --> 42:47.040
RYAN: She had a lot of bombs
and a gun.

42:47.080 --> 42:48.520
I wasn't gonna argue.

42:48.560 --> 42:50.640
Bella's got
some serious issues.

42:50.680 --> 42:52.000
Yeah, lucky for us.

42:52.040 --> 42:53.360
(GROWLING)

42:58.440 --> 42:59.560
YAZ: This way.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.920
Add one hopper virus,
leave to simmer,

43:04.960 --> 43:06.760
and we'll have
our syrillium 4.

43:06.800 --> 43:10.200
- Well, hopefully.
- Oh, Sylas! Well played, boys.

43:10.240 --> 43:11.280
Please wait.

43:11.320 --> 43:12.400
Teleport operations rebooting.

43:12.440 --> 43:14.880
(EXPLOSION)

43:18.880 --> 43:21.160
Did you both forget to mention
the massive bomb?!

43:21.200 --> 43:23.480
It's going to take about
a minute to get to full power.

43:23.520 --> 43:24.760
Nevi, we don't have a minute.

43:24.800 --> 43:26.280
Teleport occupancy exceeded.

43:26.320 --> 43:28.880
There's too many people
to transport.

43:28.920 --> 43:30.680
(SNARLING)

43:30.720 --> 43:33.240
Teleport occupancy exceeded.

43:33.280 --> 43:35.520
- Get out of here.
- No, Bella, come back here!

43:35.560 --> 43:38.560
This teleport
is now fully operational.

43:38.600 --> 43:41.600
Nevi, I've set the system.
You and Sylas can go.

43:41.640 --> 43:44.360
Sylas, you've been brilliant.

43:44.400 --> 43:45.920
Bye, Doctor.

43:47.720 --> 43:51.320
(GROWLING)

43:53.040 --> 43:55.080
- Bella!
- YAZ: Weapon failed on her!

43:56.920 --> 43:58.480
Get away from her!

43:58.520 --> 44:00.400
(SNARLS)

44:08.400 --> 44:10.560
Got this.

44:10.600 --> 44:13.720
(FIRING CONTINUES)

44:13.760 --> 44:17.560
O'Brien, party of four. Return
teleport profile located.

44:17.600 --> 44:18.680
Teleporting.

44:24.680 --> 44:26.600
We made it.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.600
She... She'll be OK.

44:31.640 --> 44:33.240
She'll be fine.
She's with Kane.

44:33.280 --> 44:35.160
How are they going to be OK?

44:36.440 --> 44:37.840
No oxygen, no help.

44:39.560 --> 44:43.040
When did you know...
that it was Earth?

44:44.720 --> 44:46.480
Just before you did.

44:52.480 --> 44:54.560
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

44:54.600 --> 44:56.600
But it's one possible future.

44:56.640 --> 44:58.000
It's one timeline.

44:59.080 --> 45:02.080
You want me to tell you
that Earth's going to be OK?

45:02.120 --> 45:03.440
Cos I can't.

45:04.720 --> 45:07.840
In your time, humanity is busy
arguing over the washing-up

45:07.880 --> 45:09.920
while the house burns down.

45:09.960 --> 45:13.320
Unless people face facts
and change,

45:13.360 --> 45:15.200
catastrophe is coming.

45:16.960 --> 45:18.480
But it's not decided.

45:19.920 --> 45:21.840
You know that.

45:21.880 --> 45:23.760
The future is not fixed.

45:23.800 --> 45:27.480
It depends on billions
of decisions, and actions,

45:27.520 --> 45:29.840
and people stepping up.

45:31.120 --> 45:33.120
Humans.

45:33.160 --> 45:36.320
I think you forget
how powerful you are.

45:36.360 --> 45:39.000
Lives change worlds.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.880
People can save planets,
or wreck them.

45:41.920 --> 45:43.840
That's the choice.

45:43.880 --> 45:45.440
Be the best of humanity.

45:47.200 --> 45:48.440
Or...

45:49.480 --> 45:50.720
(SNARLS)

45:50.760 --> 45:53.360
(ROARS)

46:25.640 --> 46:26.920
DOCTOR: Gilded Age New York.

46:26.960 --> 46:29.320
This is when
the modern world begins.

46:29.360 --> 46:30.520
It's only Nikola Tesla!

46:30.560 --> 46:33.160
The Niagara generator
should be shut down.

46:33.200 --> 46:34.560
You believe this is alien?
