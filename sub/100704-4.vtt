01:32.300 --> 01:34.052
Did Dennis come back on time?

02:08.837 --> 02:10.922
Did you get your body
through anything today, Dennis?

02:11.005 --> 02:15.051
You gotta put your body through things
so the muscles have a memorization, too.

02:16.219 --> 02:20.140
His body made it here, Phil.
Don't beg for too much.

02:43.746 --> 02:44.914
Kamikaze.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.911
<i>Jackson steps on the court</i>
<i>to argue with the referees.</i>

13:48.327 --> 13:50.329
Is there anything that you missed?

13:51.539 --> 13:53.415
You still got a little bit more room.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.585
I could've done another tier here, Mike?

14:14.812 --> 14:17.398
What gave you that sense?

14:20.192 --> 14:22.778
You don't want to go into details?

15:03.944 --> 15:05.487
Have you talked to Michael Jordan yet?

19:07.729 --> 19:09.857
That's the Scottie migraine game, right?

19:52.649 --> 19:54.109
We got Scottie and B.J.?

20:05.162 --> 20:07.748
We worked hard all season for this, guys.
Let's play hard.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.124
Leave it all on the floor.

24:06.903 --> 24:09.114
When did you decide to build it?

24:40.395 --> 24:43.607
One of the criticisms has been that
Michael Jordan is a great player,

24:43.690 --> 24:46.318
but he can't lead his teammates
to a championship.

24:46.401 --> 24:48.486
He can't make them better players.

24:48.987 --> 24:53.158
You were known at that time as the guy
who was a spectacular performer,

24:53.241 --> 24:56.203
but not the winner
that Magic and Larry were.

26:24.791 --> 26:27.669
Dumars, see I gotta help,
I gotta give him a bump...

26:27.752 --> 26:31.256
So I'm gonna be a step slow.
I'll go to yours.

34:11.591 --> 34:15.553
This is Isiah, talking about the walkoff.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.562
Go sit down, Jerry!

37:47.265 --> 37:49.892
I guess this is something that...
I've been waiting for.

37:50.559 --> 37:52.019
The team that's won it the most,

37:52.103 --> 37:53.771
in the time
I've been in the league...

37:53.854 --> 37:57.525
Even though they may have that experience,
we have that hunger.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.982
You don't have to shoot that shot.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.194
John's open right there.

41:28.277 --> 41:29.820
You can still create.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.740
He's hitting shots.

42:54.363 --> 42:55.531
You did it the right way.

42:55.948 --> 42:56.991
You did it the right way.

43:02.496 --> 43:03.330
I love you.

43:19.013 --> 43:20.347
I'm so happy.

44:01.180 --> 44:02.598
Seven-year struggle.

44:03.307 --> 44:04.725
Seven-year struggle.

45:10.249 --> 45:11.708
Shit! C'mon drop my money down.

45:11.792 --> 45:13.585
You said I can't show nobody
what I give you.

45:36.316 --> 45:38.110
This man never gets sleep.

45:38.193 --> 45:41.238
Dennis Rodman... Junior.

45:43.115 --> 45:45.909
He never gets his sleep. Single man.
Thinks he can hang out all night.

45:45.993 --> 45:47.995
Hey, hey, don't put that on tape.

45:50.205 --> 45:52.166
If he committed to one girl...
it's a lie.

45:53.208 --> 45:54.877
It's a lie, he's out every night.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.962
Do not put this on tape right here.

45:57.045 --> 45:59.423
Why not? Get some sleep, man!

45:59.506 --> 46:00.841
I get a whole lot of sleep.

46:00.924 --> 46:03.218
-You've got a hangover this morning.
-No, I... M.

46:03.302 --> 46:05.512
My mom and dad are gonna watch this, M.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.181
Mom and dad, he's an alcoholic.

46:18.650 --> 46:20.944
C'mon, Ahmad makes more than me.
