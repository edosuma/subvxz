<i>Musa was picked up by a smuggler and

05:48.945 --> 05:52.914
Shihab-Eldin: <i>The reason they sink
their own boat in Greek waters,</i>

05:52.999 --> 05:54.699
<i>is because under</i>
<i>a UN resolution,</i>

05:54.784 --> 05:58.503
<i>the Greek Coast Guard would be
forced to rescue the passengers</i>

05:58.622 --> 06:00.788
<i>and bring them to the EU.</i>

06:07.047 --> 06:09.631
Shihab-Eldin: <i>But before they

<i>the boat started</i>
<i>sinking on its own.</i>

06:26.282 --> 06:28.533

06:43.133 --> 06:44.582
<i>António Guterres,</i>

<i>who until January was the UN's
High Commissioner for Refugees.</i>

06:48.922 --> 06:51.973
It's clear that the
mega-crisis in Syria and Iraq

06:52.058 --> 06:55.226
became the worst
humanitarian situation

06:55.345 --> 06:57.061

06:57.180 --> 06:59.480
It's a catastrophic situation.

06:59.566 --> 07:02.016
People said,
"Well, we are doomed here,"

07:02.102 --> 07:06.771
and so the movement
into Europe accelerated.

07:06.856 --> 07:09.357
I remember talking to the
refugees in the beginning,

07:09.492 --> 07:11.526
they were saying,
"Soon we'll go back home.

07:11.661 --> 07:13.327
We are sure
we will go back home."

07:13.413 --> 07:17.115
And then slowly, slowly,
this hope has been vanishing

07:17.200 --> 07:20.201
as they don't see light
at the end of the tunnel.

07:20.286 --> 07:22.920
Shihab-Eldin: <i>With no hope

07:23.039 --> 07:27.008
<i>more and more refugees are

07:31.881 --> 07:34.382
(woman speaking

07:40.607 --> 07:43.141
Shihab-Eldin: <i>These refugees
may have made it to Europe,</i>

07:43.226 --> 07:47.395
<i>but for many of them the conditions
here are actually worse.</i>

07:47.480 --> 07:50.231

07:53.703 --> 07:58.539
<i>It's become so desperate, that abandoned

08:05.131 --> 08:07.715

08:23.767 --> 08:26.601
Greece has been in,
the last few years,

08:26.736 --> 08:28.603
a very difficult
economic situation.

08:28.688 --> 08:31.189
They have levels of unemployment
that are appalling.

08:31.274 --> 08:33.573
Greece is less prepared

08:33.659 --> 08:37.995
to be able to properly receive
and accept this population.

08:38.114 --> 08:40.998
Shihab-Eldin: <i>One refugee who's
learned that lesson the hard way is</i>

08:41.116 --> 08:44.919
<i>Musa's brother Ammar, who left
Syria a few months before him.</i>

08:45.004 --> 08:48.005
<i>He's been stuck here in limbo</i>
<i>for almost a year.</i>

08:48.124 --> 08:50.875
(speaking foreign language)

09:13.650 --> 09:15.650
So, are you scared to try again?

09:23.993 --> 09:26.494
Shihab-Eldin: <i>Ammar joined
hundreds of other refugees</i>

09:26.629 --> 09:29.831
<i>on a train headed north,</i>
<i>toward the Macedonian border,</i>

09:29.966 --> 09:32.583
<i>and one step closer to Germany.</i>

09:33.837 --> 09:37.505
<i>At Polikastro,</i>
<i>they continued on foot.</i>

09:37.590 --> 09:40.508
(speaking foreign language)

09:45.682 --> 09:47.481
Shihab-Eldin:
<i>Ammar split from the group,</i>

09:47.567 --> 09:50.067
<i>and after walking</i>
<i>for two straight days,</i>

09:50.186 --> 09:52.603
<i>he crossed safely</i>
<i>into Macedonia.</i>

09:54.240 --> 09:57.575
<i>But those he left behind</i>
<i>weren't so lucky.</i>

09:57.694 --> 10:02.330
Finally we get to the border and there are
hundreds of refugees waiting to cross.

10:05.335 --> 10:06.751
This is on the Greek side
of the border,

10:06.870 --> 10:09.337
and just along the way,
you see the Macedonian army.

10:09.422 --> 10:10.862
They've tried
to cross several times,

10:10.874 --> 10:12.623
and every time they cross
they get there,

10:12.709 --> 10:16.210
and whether or not the Macedonian army
actually pushes them back forcefully,

10:16.296 --> 10:20.598
they find themselves back here
because the border's closed.

10:22.719 --> 10:26.804
<i>Just a few days later,</i>
<i>tensions here exploded</i>

10:26.890 --> 10:28.189
<i>and across Europe,</i>

10:28.274 --> 10:32.109
<i>refugees overwhelmed border</i>
<i>security by the thousands.</i>

10:32.228 --> 10:33.694
<i>At the same time,</i>

10:33.780 --> 10:36.364
<i>Germany said it would accept</i>
<i>more asylum seekers,</i>

10:36.449 --> 10:39.116
<i>so individual countries began</i>
<i>sealing their borders</i>

10:39.235 --> 10:42.620
<i>and shuttling refugees</i>
<i>towards Germany by train.</i>

10:47.493 --> 10:50.544
(speaking foreign language)

11:00.089 --> 11:02.209
Shihab-Eldin: When you talk
to some of these refugees,

11:02.225 --> 11:03.557
when you ask them questions,

11:03.643 --> 11:06.177
they end up asking you as many
questions as you're asking them,

11:06.262 --> 11:09.313
because they don't have any
idea where they're going really

11:09.432 --> 11:11.933
or what they're going to do
when they get there.

11:13.736 --> 11:15.486
<i>But tensions have been mounting.</i>

11:15.605 --> 11:17.405
<i>After the terrorist</i>
<i>attacks in Paris,</i>

11:17.490 --> 11:20.491
<i>Central European countries</i>
<i>began severely restricting</i>

11:20.610 --> 11:22.693
<i>who could pass through</i>
<i>their borders.</i>

11:22.779 --> 11:25.279
New rules in the wake
of the Paris attacks:

11:25.415 --> 11:29.617
<i>Serbia, Macedonia, Croatia,</i>
<i>and Slovenia announced</i>

11:29.702 --> 11:32.169
<i>they will turn back</i>
<i>economic migrants.</i>

11:32.288 --> 11:34.255
Shihab-Eldin:
<i>Outraged refugees staged</i>

11:34.340 --> 11:36.540
<i>a gruesome demonstration</i>
<i>in response,</i>

11:36.626 --> 11:39.593
<i>sewing their lips together</i>
<i>in protest.</i>

11:40.964 --> 11:42.930
<i>And those who have</i>
<i>made it through</i>

11:43.016 --> 11:46.550
<i>have found that even Germany</i>
<i>is overwhelmed by the crisis.</i>

11:46.636 --> 11:49.470
This is the bridge connecting
Austria and Germany.

11:49.555 --> 11:52.189
You can see tons of refugees
waiting here to cross over.

11:52.308 --> 11:56.060
Even though this is hopefully the end of
their journey, they're still waiting.

11:56.145 --> 11:59.647
(speaking foreign language)

12:08.041 --> 12:09.540
Shihab-Eldin:
<i>But even inside Germany,</i>

12:09.659 --> 12:13.210
<i>there are hundreds of thousands
of refugees already waiting.</i>

12:14.330 --> 12:16.580
(speaking foreign language)

12:18.301 --> 12:20.217
Shihab-Eldin:
<i>In fact, in 2015,</i>

12:20.336 --> 12:23.054
<i>one million refugees</i>
<i>fled to Europe,</i>

12:23.172 --> 12:25.923
<i>an influx that no country</i>
<i>could handle alone.</i>

12:26.009 --> 12:31.512
<i>And the arrival of so many foreigners in
Germany has sparked a growing backlash.</i>

12:31.597 --> 12:33.731

<i>Thousands marched in Dresden</i>

13:09.852 --> 13:12.853
<i>Ammar's yearlong journey</i>
<i>had finally come to an end</i>

13:12.939 --> 13:14.388
<i>in a small city in Germany.</i>

13:14.524 --> 13:17.274
<i>But he told us that being</i>
<i>accepted into Europe</i>

13:17.393 --> 13:20.227
<i>doesn't mean being accepted</i>
<i>by the people who live here.</i>

13:32.542 --> 13:34.542

13:34.627 --> 13:37.745
Shihab-Eldin: <i>The war in Syria,
and the exodus it's causing,</i>

13:37.880 --> 13:39.663
<i>is just one of dozens</i>
<i>of conflicts</i>

13:39.749 --> 13:44.919
<i>that have created a staggering 60 million

13:45.054 --> 13:46.470

13:50.009 --> 13:52.560
<i>and even in the United States.</i>

13:52.645 --> 13:56.097
If things continue this way,
what does the future hold?

13:56.232 --> 13:58.265
I think many decision-makers
in the world,

13:58.401 --> 14:01.402
<i>refuse to see</i>
<i>the reality that is coming</i>

14:01.487 --> 14:04.605
<i>until that reality enters</i>
<i>their doors.</i>

14:04.690 --> 14:07.491
<i>We have seen a multiplication</i>
<i>of new conflicts.</i>

14:07.610 --> 14:10.027
In the past,
we had wars between states

14:10.113 --> 14:12.246
or between a government
and a rebel group.

14:12.331 --> 14:15.783
But now in many countries, you
have a multiplicity of actors.

14:15.918 --> 14:18.285
<i>You have government forces,</i>
<i>international forces,</i>

14:18.371 --> 14:22.006
<i>ethnic militias, religious
militias, political militias,</i>

14:22.125 --> 14:24.291
all operating
in the same scenarios.

14:24.427 --> 14:26.260
<i>And all the conflicts</i>
<i>are getting interlinked.</i>

14:26.345 --> 14:30.548
From Nigeria to Afghanistan, we see fighters
going from one scenario to another.

14:30.633 --> 14:32.383
It shows how
the world is changing,

14:32.468 --> 14:34.135
how it's becoming
much more dangerous

14:34.270 --> 14:36.220
<i>and how much more people</i>
<i>are suffering.</i>

14:36.305 --> 14:38.939
And we are also seeing
eruptions of xenophobia.

14:39.025 --> 14:43.611
When, for instance, someone says in Europe
that Muslim refugees are not welcome,

14:43.696 --> 14:47.314
it gives a pretext for the
propaganda that Daesh makes

14:47.450 --> 14:51.952
<i>about the attitude of the Western World
in relation to the Muslim world.</i>

14:52.038 --> 14:53.120
This cannot go on.

14:53.206 --> 14:56.574
If this goes on, everybody
will be threatened.

14:56.659 --> 14:59.360
(panicked shouting)

15:01.664 --> 15:04.165
Now the flood of refugees
coming out of Syria

15:04.250 --> 15:08.552
has been one of the largest
humanitarian crises of our modern age.

15:08.671 --> 15:11.922
But the global response to it
transformed overnight

15:12.008 --> 15:15.226
due to suspicions that a member
of the ISIS attacks on Paris

15:15.344 --> 15:18.345
may have entered the country
posing as a refugee,

15:18.431 --> 15:23.901
which has sparked a number of complex and
contradictory reactions around the world.

15:25.771 --> 15:28.822
(sirens blaring)

15:32.528 --> 15:35.863
(bells tolling)

15:38.251 --> 15:39.612
We're right in front
of Notre Dame,

15:39.669 --> 15:42.369
and this is really the first
big vigil since the shooting

15:42.455 --> 15:43.454
just a couple days ago,

15:43.539 --> 15:45.706
and hundreds of people
have come out here.

15:45.791 --> 15:48.959
There are still gunmen on the
loose that they haven't located.

15:49.045 --> 15:52.379
Everyone seems to be
still very much on edge.

15:55.017 --> 15:59.637
(speaking French)

16:12.235 --> 16:15.369
Toboni: <i>In November of 2015,

<i>Armed gunmen and</i>

16:27.416 --> 16:29.583
<i>terrorizing innocent civilians</i>

16:29.669 --> 16:32.886
<i>in a concert hall, a stadium,</i>
<i>and restaurants,</i>

16:32.972 --> 16:35.472
<i>killing 130 people.</i>

16:42.431 --> 16:46.100
These memorials, with hundreds of people
putting candles and flowers down,

16:46.235 --> 16:48.152
are all over the city.

16:49.605 --> 16:52.189
(speaking French)

16:59.582 --> 17:01.865
(speaking French)

17:16.682 --> 17:18.464
Toboni:
<i>Immediately after the attacks,</i>

17:18.601 --> 17:20.968
<i>France began dramatically</i>
<i>stepping up its airs strikes</i>

17:21.053 --> 17:23.520
<i>against ISIS targets</i>
<i>in Iraq and Syria.</i>

17:23.638 --> 17:25.306
(chanting)

17:25.441 --> 17:29.860
<i>But air strikes tend to go hand-in-hand
with a surge in anti-Muslim rhetoric.</i>

17:29.979 --> 17:34.148
<i>It helps to prove ISIS's contention
that the West is at war with Islam,</i>

17:34.233 --> 17:37.318
<i>which in turn helps to
radicalize disaffected Muslims,</i>

17:37.453 --> 17:39.236
<i>and inspire new attacks.</i>

17:39.322 --> 17:41.872
(speaking French)

17:44.243 --> 17:46.910
Toboni: <i>It's a cycle that we
don't seem to be able to break,</i>

17:46.996 --> 17:50.214
<i>and now it's playing out</i>
<i>here in the United States.</i>

17:59.675 --> 18:01.258
A married couple opened fire

18:01.344 --> 18:03.727
at the Inland Regional Center
in San Bernardino.

18:03.846 --> 18:08.015
Evidence is mounting that the killers
in San Bernardino, California,

18:08.150 --> 18:11.235
had become homegrown
Islamist radicals.

18:11.354 --> 18:14.355
Toboni: <i>The killings, coming so
soon after the Paris attacks,</i>

18:14.490 --> 18:16.273
<i>set off a call</i>
<i>to seal our borders,</i>

18:16.359 --> 18:18.659
<i>even though the attackers</i>
<i>were not refugees.</i>

18:18.744 --> 18:22.613
It is lunacy to be bringing
refugees into this country

18:22.698 --> 18:25.582
who may be terrorists
trying to murder Americans.

18:25.701 --> 18:29.453
Donald J Trump is calling for
a total and complete shutdown

18:29.538 --> 18:32.673
of Muslims entering
the United States

18:32.758 --> 18:39.797
until our country's representatives can
figure out what the hell is going on.

18:39.882 --> 18:42.683
Toboni: <i>That focus on
refugees has taken root,</i>

18:42.768 --> 18:46.804
<i>and more than 30 governors have called
for a block on Syrian refugees,</i>

18:46.889 --> 18:51.141
<i>in spite of President Obama's</i>
<i>pledge to take 10,000 more.</i>

18:51.227 --> 18:54.528
<i>And across the US, reported</i>
<i>hate crimes against Muslims</i>

18:54.613 --> 18:57.815
<i>tripled in the month</i>
<i>following the Paris attacks.</i>

18:57.900 --> 19:01.402
<i>In Dallas, civilians are</i>
<i>organizing armed protests</i>

19:01.487 --> 19:05.239
<i>and defending against what they see
as a threat to their communities.</i>

19:05.324 --> 19:07.084
So we're here with a group
outside of Dallas.

19:07.126 --> 19:10.577
They're just prepping for a
protest that they're going to do

19:10.713 --> 19:12.713
in front of a mosque
next weekend.

19:12.798 --> 19:15.916
Let's go ahead and go back
over some weapon safety.

19:16.051 --> 19:18.168
Make sure everybody's
got an empty chamber.

19:18.254 --> 19:19.586
Good hook.

19:19.722 --> 19:20.587
Safe.

19:20.673 --> 19:21.972
All right, good to go.

19:23.008 --> 19:24.224
Sweet.

19:24.310 --> 19:26.393
We're gonna be the first stage.

19:26.479 --> 19:29.012
So if someone tries
to break in the line,

19:29.098 --> 19:30.597
go ahead and close up like that.

19:30.733 --> 19:32.850
Because they're going
to be expecting us this time.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.569
Toboni:
<i>Inside the mosque,</i>

19:35.654 --> 19:37.938
<i>we watched as the imam</i>
<i>prepared his congregants.</i>

19:38.073 --> 19:41.108
Imam: Tomorrow I'm sure
most of you are aware,

19:41.193 --> 19:44.778
that there is going to be
a rally outside of our mosque,

19:44.864 --> 19:48.365
and that it's going to be
a group of armed people.

19:48.451 --> 19:51.835
Our part is to make sure that
what we're doing is correct.

19:51.954 --> 19:54.204
Toboni: <i>As the mosque
braced for this protest,</i>

19:54.290 --> 19:58.175
<i>the broader religious community held a
tense meeting about how to respond.</i>

19:58.294 --> 20:01.044
I am deeply concerned
when Muslims are harassed.

20:01.130 --> 20:02.596
I can't fathom--

20:02.681 --> 20:06.683
Wes, can you fathom people with
guns outside your church on Sunday?

20:06.802 --> 20:08.302
I mean, it's outrageous.

20:08.437 --> 20:11.221
When I hear a presidential
candidate say,

20:11.307 --> 20:14.391
it's a good idea
to register and label people,

20:14.477 --> 20:19.730
that has echoes
for me of 1930s Germany.

20:19.815 --> 20:24.368
I think about my grandfather who was a
social activist, amongst many things,

20:24.487 --> 20:27.871
and one night was visited
by the Klan to his home.

20:27.990 --> 20:31.959
My grandfather invited the
grand wizard in for coffee.

20:32.044 --> 20:33.877
He wanted him to know that

20:33.996 --> 20:35.496
"Yes, you can show up
at my door,

20:35.581 --> 20:37.714
but you're not going
to cause me to run away."

20:37.833 --> 20:40.667
In moments like this,
you can't remain silent.

20:40.753 --> 20:42.135
I think people
are being challenged

20:42.221 --> 20:46.006
to determine what side of history
they're going to stand on.

20:50.729 --> 20:53.931
I saw the sign here that says
"Say no to Syrian refugees."

20:54.016 --> 20:55.399
Do you also back that message?

20:55.518 --> 20:56.433
Absolutely.

20:56.519 --> 20:58.485
The less of 'em
in this country, the better.

21:00.239 --> 21:02.689
How does it feel to be
a former US Marine

21:02.775 --> 21:04.441
and a part of the Muslim
community

21:04.527 --> 21:07.411
and having these guys come up here
saying basically, you're un-American,

21:07.530 --> 21:10.414
and if you're a Muslim, there's a
good chance that you're a terrorist?

21:10.533 --> 21:13.667
What they're seeing in the media
is not the Islam that I know.

21:13.752 --> 21:15.919
The things they teach you in the
military, when you go to combat,

21:16.038 --> 21:19.206
you dehumanize your enemy so it
makes it easier to kill them.

21:19.341 --> 21:21.291
That's what all this
is rolled up to be.

21:21.377 --> 21:23.677
An attempt
to dehumanize Muslims,

21:23.762 --> 21:25.546
make them seem
like they're not American,

21:25.681 --> 21:30.717
like they don't belong, when they have
every right just like any other American.

21:30.769 --> 21:33.937
If a Syrian refugee came in
here and killed your kid,

21:34.056 --> 21:35.389
you'd be over here with me.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.859
Man:
That's not the point.

21:38.944 --> 21:40.444
The point is-- That's the
point you just made.

21:40.563 --> 21:41.895
You said Syrian refugees.
No, the point is

21:42.031 --> 21:44.731
is that ISIS is mixing in with
Syrian refugees, that's a fact.

21:45.868 --> 21:47.734
Do you attend this mosque here?
Yes.

21:47.870 --> 21:48.902
Okay.
Yes, we do.

21:48.988 --> 21:50.404
And what do you make
of the protests here?

21:50.489 --> 21:51.989
In a way,
I don't blame these people.

21:52.074 --> 21:54.458
Most of these people,
they misunderstand.

21:54.577 --> 21:56.577
Islam is not
about killing people.

21:56.662 --> 21:58.579
Islam is not about hate.

21:58.714 --> 22:01.081
Islam is about love, peace.

22:01.216 --> 22:02.749
What ISIS is doing,

22:02.885 --> 22:05.752
unfortunately, us here,
Muslims in America,

22:05.888 --> 22:07.254
we are suffering behind that.

22:07.339 --> 22:11.091
My wife gets harassed at work
because of what she's wearing.

22:11.176 --> 22:14.845
My son,
he got jumped in the gym.

22:14.930 --> 22:16.763
Ahmed, what would you want
to tell somebody

22:16.899 --> 22:19.933
who bullies you or who doesn't
understand your religion?

22:20.019 --> 22:24.488
Just think before they do what
they do and say what they say

22:24.607 --> 22:27.074
because we're not all bad.

22:28.944 --> 22:30.827
Usually you drive past
a protest like this,

22:30.946 --> 22:33.330
you see guys with big guns,
and you sort of think,

22:33.449 --> 22:34.998
"Oh, they're just
crazy extremists."

22:35.117 --> 22:38.085
But now that you have governors and
senators, presidential candidates

22:38.170 --> 22:40.087
coming out and speaking
the same message,

22:40.172 --> 22:43.290
they actually don't seem
that fringe anymore.

22:43.425 --> 22:46.043
Toboni: <i>Around the same time,
the governor of Texas announced</i>

22:46.128 --> 22:50.347
<i>that he would attempt to block all
Syrian refugees from entering his state.</i>

22:50.466 --> 22:53.800
Syrian refugees are not
going to be allowed

22:53.886 --> 22:56.436
into the state of Texas
and given refuge.

22:56.522 --> 22:58.805
Toboni: <i>Despite the
Governor's proposed block,</i>

22:58.891 --> 23:01.475
<i>one family was able</i>
<i>to beat the odds.</i>

23:01.560 --> 23:04.978
<i>We met up with them during their
very first hours in Texas</i>

23:05.064 --> 23:07.397
<i>as they reunited</i>
<i>with their family.</i>

23:07.483 --> 23:10.567
(speaking foreign language)

23:15.324 --> 23:17.824
Toboni: <i>Faez came to
America ten months ago.</i>

23:17.960 --> 23:19.876
<i>Now, after two years apart,</i>

23:19.995 --> 23:23.246
<i>his brother, nephew and their
families have arrived safely.</i>

23:23.332 --> 23:26.249
Most Americans have no idea
what you've been through.

23:26.335 --> 23:29.753
How do you raise a family
in a place like Syria

23:29.838 --> 23:31.171
the way it is right now?

23:31.306 --> 23:34.091
(speaking foreign language)

24:12.514 --> 24:14.798
Toboni: <i>The US traditionally
accepts more refugees</i>

24:14.883 --> 24:16.299
<i>than any other country.</i>

24:16.385 --> 24:19.102
<i>But when it comes to Syrian</i>
<i>refugees, like this family,</i>

24:19.221 --> 24:20.387
<i>the opposite is true.</i>

24:20.472 --> 24:23.356
<i>While other countries have</i>
<i>admitted hundreds of thousands</i>

24:23.442 --> 24:24.725
<i>of displaced Syrians,</i>

24:24.860 --> 24:28.228
<i>the US have accepted about</i>
<i>4,000 since the war began.</i>

24:28.313 --> 24:31.448
<i>But some lawmakers here</i>
<i>think even that is too many.</i>

24:31.567 --> 24:36.286
We also need to do everything we can to
block terrorist pathways into our country.

24:36.405 --> 24:37.904
<i>Congressman Michael McCaul,</i>

24:37.990 --> 24:40.657
<i>who fought to keep this Syrian
family from settling in Texas</i>

24:40.743 --> 24:44.461
<i>introduced legislation that would
all but block more refugees</i>

24:44.580 --> 24:45.912
<i>from Syrian and Iraq.</i>

24:46.048 --> 24:47.547
The system as it is now,

24:47.633 --> 24:50.083
in order for somebody to get
through our refugee program--

24:50.219 --> 24:51.668
first of all, less than
one percent chance,

24:51.754 --> 24:53.386
they'll get past
the first stage with UNHCR.

24:53.472 --> 24:56.389
They then are investigated,
interviewed by multiple US agencies--

24:56.475 --> 24:58.425
that's the FBI, DHS,
State Department,

24:58.560 --> 25:01.261
Counterterrorism Unit,
Intelligence Community.

25:01.346 --> 25:03.513
It's not an easy process,
can take up to two years.

25:03.599 --> 25:06.483
Why would ISIS send somebody
through that process?

25:06.602 --> 25:08.518
Well, that's a good
question for ISIS,

25:08.604 --> 25:10.570
but we know that they
have tried to do it.

25:10.656 --> 25:13.190
I know your state was recently
embroiled in a debate

25:13.275 --> 25:16.660
surrounding whether or not to let
Syrian refugee families into Texas.

25:16.779 --> 25:18.111
What was your stance on that?

25:18.247 --> 25:20.614
I'm hopeful that
my bill will pass,

25:20.749 --> 25:24.117
so that we can, again, put
a better system in place--

25:24.203 --> 25:28.338
And so you didn't want those families accepted
until a new vetting process was in place?

25:28.457 --> 25:31.458
Well, they submitted
a statement from me

25:31.543 --> 25:33.960
that our
intelligence services have--

25:34.046 --> 25:36.429
are warning that they are
trying to exploit it.

25:36.515 --> 25:38.348
But the Justice Department
came back

25:38.467 --> 25:41.802
and called the evidence that State was
putting forward uninformed and speculative.

25:41.937 --> 25:44.554
Well, I don't want to get into all
the ins and outs of that case.

25:44.640 --> 25:49.476
That's a state attorney
general making his case.

25:49.561 --> 25:52.646
I don't know the-- all the
specifics on this family.

25:52.781 --> 25:55.315
I understand the security concern,
but by hitting the brakes

25:55.450 --> 25:57.317
on accepting refugees
into our country

25:57.452 --> 25:59.653
are we in some way
closing the door

25:59.788 --> 26:01.988
to the most vulnerable
population in the world?

26:02.124 --> 26:06.326
And isn't that sort of the most
un-American thing we can be doing?

26:06.461 --> 26:09.746
No, I think it's very pro-American
to protect American lives,

26:09.832 --> 26:13.166
and I would argue that
until I'm given assurance

26:13.252 --> 26:17.220
by the secretary of Homeland, the FBI director,
the director of National Intelligence

26:17.339 --> 26:21.224
<i>that these people don't pose a
threat to our national security,</i>

26:21.343 --> 26:23.226
<i>I'm uncomfortable.</i>

26:23.345 --> 26:25.679
If we don't do this right,
Americans could die,

26:25.764 --> 26:27.264
and that's what
we're trying to stop.

26:27.349 --> 26:29.983
Toboni: <i>Congressman McCaul's
bill passed the House,</i>

26:30.068 --> 26:31.184
<i>but failed in the Senate.</i>

26:31.320 --> 26:34.020
<i>So for now, we won't be</i>
<i>closing our doors to refugees.</i>

26:34.106 --> 26:38.275
<i>But the rhetoric surrounding this legislation
may be aiding terrorist recruitment.</i>

26:38.360 --> 26:42.863
Donald Trump's recent comments about barring
Muslims from entering the United States

26:42.948 --> 26:46.867
are now part of a recruitment video for a
terror group affiliated with Al Qaeda.

26:47.002 --> 26:49.452
Toboni: <i>And the idea that
terror groups could seize</i>

26:49.538 --> 26:53.123
<i>on this deeply polarized climate
to inspire new attacks,</i>

26:53.208 --> 26:57.260
<i>has American counter-terrorism</i>
<i>units preparing for the worst.</i>

26:57.379 --> 26:59.462
We've seen what happened
in San Bernardino.

26:59.548 --> 27:01.798
So we're talking about now
multiple-pronged attacks

27:01.884 --> 27:04.601
using heavy weapons
and improvised explosives.

27:05.888 --> 27:07.554
Toboni: <i>We spoke to the
head of the NYPD's</i>

27:07.639 --> 27:09.389
<i>Counter Terrorism Unit,</i>
<i>John Miller,</i>

27:09.474 --> 27:11.524
<i>about the evolution</i>
<i>of the terrorist threat.</i>

27:11.610 --> 27:14.277
We're in what's being referred
to as a cycle of terror.

27:14.396 --> 27:16.730
9/11 happens, we invade Iraq.

27:16.865 --> 27:19.566
ISIS rises,
we're now air-striking ISIS.

27:19.651 --> 27:25.789
Are we under more of a threat because
of how we're reacting to terrorists?

27:25.908 --> 27:28.625
You have to take into account that
over the last couple of years,

27:28.744 --> 27:32.579
between 65 and 85 percent of the killing
worldwide in the name of terrorism

27:32.664 --> 27:36.132
has been carried out by two groups
that didn't even exist before 9/11.

27:36.251 --> 27:39.302
ISIL, the Islamic State,
and Boko Haram.

27:39.421 --> 27:44.424
So the world is getting to be,
continually, a more dangerous place.

27:44.559 --> 27:46.643
And that--
That's a real challenge.

27:46.762 --> 27:48.478
What's the current threat
to the US,

27:48.597 --> 27:50.277
and more specifically,
New York, right now?

27:50.399 --> 27:55.602
At any given time, we have three
or four major cases going on

27:55.687 --> 27:57.771
into long-term threats,

27:57.856 --> 28:00.573
and, as disturbing as it may

Toboni: <i>That new normal means
we're going to be on high alert</i>

28:04.496 --> 28:06.079
<i>for the foreseeable future.</i>

28:06.164 --> 28:08.581
<i>And the biggest question</i>
<i>we face going forward</i>

28:08.667 --> 28:13.203
<i>is what to do about the millions of
refugees who want protection in the West.</i>

28:13.288 --> 28:16.840
<i>It's a huge decision with</i>
<i>far-reaching consequences,</i>

28:16.959 --> 28:18.458
<i>not just for these families,</i>

28:18.543 --> 28:22.462
<i>but for our political process</i>
<i>and the fabric of our country.</i>
