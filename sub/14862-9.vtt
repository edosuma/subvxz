00:03.945 --> 00:06.616
If the baby isn't mine,
you have a choice to make...

00:06.617 --> 00:08.198
Me or the baby.

00:08.199 --> 00:09.532
<i>Previously on "Mistresses"...</i>

00:09.533 --> 00:10.933
I'm keeping this baby.

00:10.934 --> 00:13.336
Sam's become infatuated with me.

00:13.337 --> 00:15.881
Maybe you could tell him
you were screwing his father.

00:15.882 --> 00:19.243
That should break the spell.

00:19.244 --> 00:23.264
<i>♪ Naughty girls need love... too.</i>

00:23.491 --> 00:25.724
Mom, over here!

00:25.725 --> 00:28.245
Where is she?

00:30.997 --> 00:33.198
Where's her bathing suit?

00:33.199 --> 00:35.300
<i>♪ I'm in love with you.</i>

00:35.301 --> 00:37.382
Don't worry. No one's looking.

00:37.383 --> 00:39.476
Yoo-hoo! Savi!

00:39.477 --> 00:41.397
Joss!

00:43.017 --> 00:45.237
Hey, mom!

00:47.456 --> 00:49.881
She's out there kind of far, isn't she?

00:49.882 --> 00:52.273
<i>♪ Oh, it's only you I adore.</i>

00:52.274 --> 00:54.119
<i>♪ So much more than my body.</i>

00:54.120 --> 00:57.250
She's just trying to get
the beefcake to save her.

00:57.251 --> 00:59.490
It's okay, Joss.

00:59.491 --> 01:01.292
He'll blow his whistle any minute.

01:01.293 --> 01:04.918
<i>♪ Even still there's
a thrill in my heart.</i>

01:08.031 --> 01:09.640

01:19.494 --> 01:21.414
Joss?

01:21.862 --> 01:23.362
Karen.

01:23.363 --> 01:25.763
What is it?

01:26.966 --> 01:30.446
Okay. I'll be right there.

01:32.085 --> 01:34.291
I suppose I should've seen this coming.

01:34.292 --> 01:35.918
But how could I have known?

01:35.919 --> 01:39.381
The whole time, Elizabeth
was acting like my friend.

01:39.382 --> 01:41.371
I mean, how could I
possibly have thought that...

01:41.372 --> 01:43.426
- You couldn't.
- She held your hand at the funeral.

01:43.427 --> 01:45.549
The woman was obviously
trying to mess with your head.

01:45.550 --> 01:47.415
Unless she didn't know then.

01:47.416 --> 01:49.078
Maybe it was the sunglasses.

01:49.079 --> 01:50.133
What sunglasses?

01:50.134 --> 01:53.145
I accidentally left my
sunglasses in Tom's apartment.

01:53.146 --> 01:55.728
Sam thought they were his
mom's, so he gave them to her.

01:55.729 --> 01:58.764
That may be how Elizabeth found
out that Tom was having an affair.

01:58.765 --> 02:01.471
That's crazy. How would
she know they were yours?

02:01.472 --> 02:02.641
Sunglasses are sunglasses.

02:02.642 --> 02:04.903
Hey. Unless they're awesome sunglasses.

02:04.904 --> 02:08.079
I'm just saying, if somebody's rockin'
a killer pair of Tom Ford's, I take note.

02:08.080 --> 02:10.285
Okay, okay, stop.

02:10.286 --> 02:12.587
What you need to do right now
is listen to your instincts.

02:12.588 --> 02:14.702
What are they telling you?

02:14.703 --> 02:16.020
She's known the whole time.

02:16.021 --> 02:18.126
Um, which means she's a sociopath.

02:18.127 --> 02:20.958
- Okay, can we not...
- What?

02:20.959 --> 02:23.061
- Well, she is still my client.
- So dump her.

02:23.062 --> 02:25.796
- Joss, I can't just dump her.
- Why not? Karen is your best friend.

02:25.797 --> 02:28.610
Where is your loyalty?

02:28.611 --> 02:32.488
Karen, if she knew, when she knew, I
mean, what difference does it make now?

02:32.489 --> 02:35.447
If she's known from the beginning,
she's been lying to me from day one.

02:35.448 --> 02:38.041
And if that's the case...

02:38.042 --> 02:41.886
What if she lied about the way Tom died?

02:41.887 --> 02:42.980
What if...

02:42.981 --> 02:47.001
Elizabeth killed Tom because of me?

02:49.199 --> 02:51.588
If his death was somehow
my... my fault, I can't...

02:51.589 --> 02:52.944
No, it is not.

02:52.945 --> 02:56.507
Hey, and if we want to look at the silver
lining here, he was gonna die soon anyway.

02:56.508 --> 03:01.171
So as far as murders go, it's,
like, not the worst kind of murder.

03:01.172 --> 03:04.688
And I'm gonna stop talking now.

03:04.689 --> 03:06.687
Savi, you've met her. What do you think?

03:06.688 --> 03:08.898
Do you think she's capable
of something like this?

03:08.899 --> 03:12.266
How do you know if
someone's capable of murder?

03:12.267 --> 03:14.680
There must be some way to find out.

03:14.681 --> 03:16.819
There is no light at the
end of this tunnel, okay?

03:16.820 --> 03:20.180
You have to let this go.

03:38.161 --> 03:40.170
Uh, sorry. I'm in here.

03:40.171 --> 03:43.260
I thought you'd be at work.

03:43.261 --> 03:44.949
You call this a hide a key?

03:44.950 --> 03:46.441
First rock I tried.

03:46.442 --> 03:48.984
Janet. What are you doing? Hey.

03:48.985 --> 03:51.235
Harry, come here.

03:51.236 --> 03:54.850
Aside from handsome, how are you?

03:54.851 --> 03:56.365
Oh, let me look at you.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.288
Oh, screw it. Let's keep hugging.

03:58.289 --> 04:00.689
I can look at you later.

04:00.690 --> 04:02.257
Savi's not expecting me.

04:02.258 --> 04:05.050
Is she here? No, of course she's
not here. The girl's always working.

04:05.051 --> 04:07.829
Uh, no. Um... can I get you something?

04:07.830 --> 04:10.350
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, please.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.580
What a trip.

04:11.581 --> 04:15.454
What a freaking nightmare the
bus system is in this country.

04:15.455 --> 04:16.709
You took the bus?

04:16.709 --> 04:18.839
No, I hitched with a
couple I met in Santa Fe.

04:18.841 --> 04:22.229
We got hit by a bus
somewhere along the 40.

04:22.230 --> 04:23.515
Had to rent another car.

04:23.516 --> 04:25.918
No convertibles
available, needless to say.

04:25.919 --> 04:27.758
Sharp pain in the ass.

04:27.759 --> 04:30.339
- Yes.
- Nice.

04:31.915 --> 04:33.840
- So how are you, darling?
- Good.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.761
Yeah?

04:35.994 --> 04:39.263
So packing up the kitchen, I see.

04:39.264 --> 04:40.798
You got catering camp?

04:40.799 --> 04:42.555
Uh...

04:42.556 --> 04:45.172
I moved out of the house.

04:45.173 --> 04:46.149
What?

04:46.150 --> 04:48.144
I don't know what else
to say here except, if you

04:48.145 --> 04:51.026
want to know more, you
should probably talk to Savi.

04:51.027 --> 04:55.047
And I should probably get to work.

04:55.778 --> 04:57.499
It's really great to see you.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.780
Yeah. I...

05:03.373 --> 05:05.407
Brought you a present.

05:05.408 --> 05:09.142
- It's a Pirate Parrot.
- You know I'm a Dodgers fan, right?

05:09.143 --> 05:11.160
I think he's kinda cute.

05:11.161 --> 05:13.315
I'm so excited to see you.
I want to hear everything.

05:13.316 --> 05:15.250
What did you say? What did Lucy say?

05:15.251 --> 05:17.927
When I told Madi about it, she
got so excited, she started crying.

05:17.928 --> 05:20.022
She said Lucy already
seemed like a sister to her.

05:20.023 --> 05:24.185
Uh, not that we're getting married
or... or anything like that.

05:24.186 --> 05:25.986
Oh.

05:27.368 --> 05:31.386
- Wow. You didn't tell Lucy about us yet.
- I... she got sick and...

05:31.387 --> 05:33.874
Wow. Uh, I don't believe this.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.343
You said you were ready. I
wouldn't have told Madi if you...

05:36.344 --> 05:39.324
Honestly, it got away from me.

05:39.325 --> 05:42.746
Things got crazy. She had a stomach flu.

05:42.747 --> 05:45.272
It was a long week, Richard. I'm sorry.

05:45.273 --> 05:47.853
I just forgot.

05:48.037 --> 05:49.221
Something happen?

05:49.222 --> 05:52.522
Yes, but it's over now.

05:53.051 --> 05:55.511
Miranda left.

05:58.262 --> 06:00.163
Yes, she did.

06:00.164 --> 06:03.567
I'm sorry. Sometimes I forget
how much you have going on.

06:03.568 --> 06:05.904
But look, it's... it's over now.

06:05.905 --> 06:10.209
She's gone. You can move
on with your life, right?

06:10.210 --> 06:12.958
We... can move on.

06:12.959 --> 06:17.530
And I am gonna tell Lucy
about us tonight. I promise.

06:17.531 --> 06:19.487
Now sit down.

06:19.488 --> 06:23.628
I want to hear all about your trip.

06:23.719 --> 06:25.639
Okay.

06:44.288 --> 06:48.090
<i>Webbed fingers and toes are poking
out from your baby's hands and feet.</i>

06:48.091 --> 06:51.691
<i>His tail is just about gone.</i>

06:51.987 --> 06:54.556
Sorry. Uh, thought you were out.

06:54.557 --> 06:56.767
Uh, I was just dropping off
some things for you to sign.

06:56.768 --> 06:59.768
It's okay. Come in.

07:00.099 --> 07:03.059
Um, I'll just pick 'em up later, yeah.

07:03.060 --> 07:06.397
I'll just do 'em now.
It'll take a minute.

07:06.398 --> 07:08.318
Okay.

07:10.376 --> 07:12.902
Heard you, uh, stayed
till midnight last night.

07:12.903 --> 07:15.571
Yeah, I wanted to get a
jump on that Hayes case.

07:15.572 --> 07:19.311
Logging extra hours isn't gonna
get you back on partner track.

07:19.312 --> 07:21.444
Not since your husband went
all Russell Crowe on me.

07:21.445 --> 07:24.763
Yeah, luckily making partner
isn't a priority right now.

07:24.764 --> 07:27.735
Marriage comes first.

07:27.736 --> 07:30.316
Harry moved out of the house.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.897
You all right?

07:33.121 --> 07:37.201
Honestly, I don't... I don't know.

07:38.591 --> 07:40.403
Hello. Savannah Davis.

07:40.404 --> 07:41.632
Hey.

07:41.633 --> 07:42.983
Harry. Hi.

07:42.984 --> 07:47.026
Yeah, look, I know this isn't the best bit
of news, but I thought I should warn you.

07:47.027 --> 07:50.367
- Your mother's in town.
- Oh, my God. I knew it.

07:50.368 --> 07:53.283
- Had your dream again, huh?
- Yeah. Same drill as always.

07:53.284 --> 07:56.925
I don't hear from her for months
and then I have the dream, and bam...

07:56.926 --> 07:58.653
She shows up the next day.

07:58.654 --> 08:01.574
I'm like a dog who knows
when an earthquake's coming.

08:01.575 --> 08:04.609
Yeah, well, I thought you should
know, I ran into her at the house...

08:04.610 --> 08:07.277
When I was picking up a few things.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.289
Oh.

08:08.290 --> 08:11.731
Yeah, I tried to cover, but she's
too smart for me, I'm afraid.

08:11.732 --> 08:14.536
I told her I moved out,
but that's all I said, okay?

08:14.537 --> 08:18.857
It's up to you if you
want to tell her the rest.

08:18.858 --> 08:22.038
Thanks for the warning.

08:22.988 --> 08:27.323
- Uh, so how are you?
- You get the paternity results back?

08:27.324 --> 08:29.784
No, not yet.

08:30.270 --> 08:32.291
Right. Well...

08:32.292 --> 08:35.052
That's it, then.

09:08.293 --> 09:09.761
Here you go.

09:09.762 --> 09:11.873
Oh, thanks.

09:11.874 --> 09:13.975
But I'm not sure I need coffee.

09:13.976 --> 09:16.160
I'm already anxious enough.

09:16.161 --> 09:19.797
Trying to solve a murder mystery
all by yourself will do that.

09:19.798 --> 09:24.171
Even Angela Lansbury had a helper. You
remember that little old guy? He was cute.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.517
Want to be my little old guy?

09:25.518 --> 09:29.444
If you're really serious about this,
I think you should hire a professional.

09:29.445 --> 09:31.020
A professional what?

09:31.021 --> 09:33.749
When I was trying to figure
out what to do about Miranda,

09:33.750 --> 09:36.881
Savi hired this guy to
look into her for me.

09:36.882 --> 09:40.618
Well, granted, he wasn't as thorough as
I might have hoped, but he was helpful.

09:40.619 --> 09:42.192
I don't think I can ask Savi.

09:42.193 --> 09:47.126
No, but if you're willing to pay, I'm sure
there are people out there who can help.

09:47.127 --> 09:49.127
Or you can...

09:49.128 --> 09:51.048
Move on.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.928
Focus on the positive
things in your life.

09:52.929 --> 09:56.382
That's what I'm trying
to do with Richard.

09:56.383 --> 09:57.888
What's happening with Richard?

09:57.889 --> 10:00.391
Oh, we don't have to talk about that.

10:00.392 --> 10:04.532
I'd so much rather talk about that.

10:07.726 --> 10:10.951
Basically, I'm trying to figure
out if it's worth telling Lucy

10:10.952 --> 10:13.364
about Richard when I still
haven't told Richard about Paul.

10:13.365 --> 10:15.652
And if he's just gonna break
up with me when he finds out.

10:15.653 --> 10:18.294
Come on. Richard is not
going to end the relationship

10:18.295 --> 10:21.077
just because something
terrible happened to you.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.530
And if he does, he doesn't deserve you.

10:23.531 --> 10:25.631
I know.

10:27.464 --> 10:32.744
So really, why haven't you
told Richard about Paul?

10:33.277 --> 10:36.613
Honestly, I don't want to deal with
his feelings about the whole thing.

10:36.614 --> 10:39.315
He's bound to have an opinion.

10:39.316 --> 10:41.306
Everything is just so
serious from the get-go.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.339
I mean, I just want to enjoy
the beginning, the fun part.

10:44.340 --> 10:46.506
So don't tell him.

10:46.507 --> 10:48.305
Paul is back in Florida, right?

10:48.306 --> 10:50.043
Yeah, he's gone but,

10:50.044 --> 10:53.399
isn't honesty kind of a big deal
when you're starting a relationship?

10:53.400 --> 10:56.243
Like you said, this
is just the beginning.

10:56.244 --> 11:00.144
You don't owe Richard your past.

11:03.991 --> 11:07.095
Well, my clients aren't
willing to go a penny above 2.5.

11:07.096 --> 11:10.299
They don't care that the house is in the
third street elementary district, Bob.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.907
- They're 80 years old.
- Who's up for a cocktail?

11:12.908 --> 11:14.431
I gotta go.

11:14.432 --> 11:17.367
Oh, my freak. Mommy! When
the hell did you get here?

11:17.368 --> 11:19.015
- This morning.
- Hi!

11:19.016 --> 11:21.129
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:21.130 --> 11:22.653
Hi, I'm Janet.

11:22.654 --> 11:24.420
Todd. Nice to meet you.

11:24.421 --> 11:26.078
Love the ascot. Thank you.

11:26.079 --> 11:29.312
Yeah. Oh! I am so happy you're here.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.850
I am in desperate, desperate
need of a pick-me-up.

11:31.851 --> 11:33.713
What is it, baby?

11:33.714 --> 11:35.686
My life's officially gone to crap.

11:35.687 --> 11:38.420
Your life is exactly
as it's supposed to be.

11:38.421 --> 11:41.501
- It is a process.
- No, it's a joke.

11:41.502 --> 11:43.929
For starters, I'm a realtor
with no place to live.

11:43.930 --> 11:45.618
I thought you were
in Savi's guest house.

11:45.619 --> 11:48.133
No, we got in a wicked fight.
Totally her fault, by the way.

11:48.134 --> 11:50.308
Plus, my new tyrant boss hates me.

11:50.309 --> 11:53.249
- Mm. Woman?
- Man.

11:53.428 --> 11:58.088
Well, you must have a fabulous boy
or three in your life right now.

11:58.089 --> 12:00.305
Well, no boys at the moment.

12:00.306 --> 12:03.913
But there is a girl who's pretty great.

12:03.914 --> 12:09.814
So you're a homeless lesbian with a
crappy job and a withholding older sister.

12:09.915 --> 12:12.491
What do you say, fill me in over lunch?

12:12.492 --> 12:15.492
That would be great.

12:20.101 --> 12:22.862
- Hi.
- Hi. Uh, mom's in town.

12:22.863 --> 12:24.399
Yeah, I know.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.914
Oh. How do you know?

12:25.915 --> 12:28.309
- I spoke to Harry this morning.
- Oh.

12:28.310 --> 12:31.304
- How'd that go?
- It was fine.

12:31.305 --> 12:32.320
Where is she?

12:32.321 --> 12:34.605
In the car. Waiting while I
convince you to come to lunch.

12:34.606 --> 12:36.508
I can't. I have to get
through all this work.

12:36.509 --> 12:38.475
Come on. Work later.
When's mom ever in town?

12:38.476 --> 12:41.599
Okay, please don't make it seem
like I don't want to see her,

12:41.600 --> 12:43.315
because I do want to see her.

12:43.316 --> 12:46.284
Just, if she had given us some warning,
I could've cleared out my schedule.

12:46.285 --> 12:49.454
What do you want? She's spontaneous.
Besides, I think she has news.

12:49.455 --> 12:51.729
I am not standing up at
another one of her weddings.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.551
Oh, I don't think it's that.

12:53.552 --> 12:56.564
And I'm sure she'd love
to hear your big news.

12:56.565 --> 12:59.788
The... the baby stuff,
not the divorce stuff.

12:59.789 --> 13:01.997
First of all, I'm separated.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.108
And second of all, are you high?

13:04.109 --> 13:05.511
I'm not telling her about the baby.

13:05.512 --> 13:09.513
She won't judge that you
don't know who the father is.

13:09.514 --> 13:11.715
Unless you do know.

13:11.716 --> 13:13.449
Uh, did the results come back?

13:13.450 --> 13:16.398
Oh, my God. The results came back?

13:16.399 --> 13:17.797
- Yeah.
- And?

13:17.798 --> 13:19.909
I haven't looked yet.

13:19.910 --> 13:22.190
What? Why?

13:22.845 --> 13:25.161
Wow. Savi, I really
don't understand you.

13:25.162 --> 13:27.193
Yeah, this just in.

13:27.194 --> 13:28.240
Okay.

13:28.241 --> 13:31.500
Well, fine you don't have to tell her
anything just please come to lunch with us.

13:31.501 --> 13:33.945
She'd be really hurt.

13:33.946 --> 13:35.918
- Okay, fine.
- Thank you.

13:35.919 --> 13:39.198
You don't say anything
to her either, okay?

13:39.199 --> 13:44.239
Wow. You really don't
trust me at all, do you?

13:54.836 --> 13:58.464
So he tells me, "you puke
in a bucket for six hours".

13:58.465 --> 14:00.560
"You commune with your soul," thank you.

14:00.561 --> 14:02.361
"Then you touch the hand of God".

14:02.362 --> 14:03.696
So what did you say to him?

14:03.697 --> 14:06.782
I said, "it sounds like every one
of my Saturday nights in the '90s".

14:06.783 --> 14:11.838
"Go to Peru without me. I'm not
drinking some psychedelic roots".

14:11.839 --> 14:13.473
Mm.

14:13.474 --> 14:15.274
Well...

14:15.275 --> 14:17.109
Did you notice anything, mom?

14:17.110 --> 14:18.545
What's that, honey?

14:18.546 --> 14:22.515
It's the necklace you gave
her for her 7th birthday.

14:22.516 --> 14:25.009
Oh! Yes. Oh, "fabulous".

14:25.010 --> 14:27.186
Oh, I can't believe you still have it.

14:27.187 --> 14:29.233
Mm. It's kept me
fabulous all these years.

14:29.234 --> 14:31.781
- It sure has, baby.
- Ooh.

14:31.782 --> 14:35.005
So, Jossy, tell me all
about this, uh, Alex.

14:35.006 --> 14:37.886
Oh, Alex. She's...

14:37.887 --> 14:42.009
She's authentic and
she's beautiful. And...

14:42.010 --> 14:43.653
She would've really
loved to have met you,

14:43.654 --> 14:45.606
but she's doing this yoga
thing in Santa Barbara.

14:45.607 --> 14:49.363
- Oh, well, maybe next time.
- Mm hmm.

14:49.364 --> 14:51.284
What?

14:52.765 --> 14:54.846
Did I say anything?

14:54.847 --> 14:57.386
I might still be with her when
mom comes back to visit, Savi.

14:57.387 --> 14:59.261
Well, that depends.

14:59.262 --> 15:00.663
I'm...

15:00.664 --> 15:03.904
Going away for a while.

15:04.281 --> 15:06.570
What do you mean?

15:06.571 --> 15:08.015
I'm moving to...

15:08.016 --> 15:09.030
Rio!

15:09.031 --> 15:11.952
Oh, that's... oh,
unbelievably cool, mom.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.442
- Seriously?
- Why?

15:13.443 --> 15:17.185
Why not? Santa Fe's getting dullsville.

15:17.186 --> 15:20.554
I woke up one day, and all the cute
men had become old and doddering.

15:20.555 --> 15:21.511
Mm.

15:21.512 --> 15:26.193
I said to myself, "Janet, it
is time to infuse some life

15:26.194 --> 15:29.809
into my life while I'm still
young enough to enjoy it".

15:29.810 --> 15:31.921
- Amen.
- How long will you be gone?

15:31.922 --> 15:34.598
Mm. Don't know. At
least a year. Maybe two.

15:34.599 --> 15:36.973
Put most of my stuff in storage.

15:36.974 --> 15:40.274
Bought a one-way ticket.

15:41.073 --> 15:43.197
Well, obviously, we need
to have a going-away party.

15:43.198 --> 15:45.389
Oh, that's a great idea, but
it'll have to be tomorrow,

15:45.390 --> 15:47.010
because I'm leaving the day after that.

15:47.011 --> 15:49.935
I don't think I have time
right now to have a party.

15:49.936 --> 15:51.965
Oh, Savi. Don't stress.
I'll handle everything,

15:51.966 --> 15:53.317
I just need to borrow the house.

15:53.318 --> 15:54.537
Okay.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.910
So... Brazilian theme, clearly.

15:56.911 --> 16:00.031
Caipirinhas, of course.

16:00.824 --> 16:04.124
I love that. Caipirinhas.

16:07.625 --> 16:09.499
- This is George.
- Hi, uh...

16:09.500 --> 16:11.720
I got your number through
a friend of a friend.

16:11.721 --> 16:16.707
I was wondering if you could
help me out with something.

16:16.708 --> 16:20.612
I'm not sure how to start. I've never
hired a private investigator before.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.409
Person, place, or thing?

16:22.410 --> 16:23.544
Person.

16:23.545 --> 16:24.645
Male or female?

16:24.646 --> 16:25.489
Female.

16:25.490 --> 16:27.914
Friend or foe?

16:27.915 --> 16:30.605
The jury's still out on that one, huh?

16:30.606 --> 16:32.827
Well, what did she do?

16:32.828 --> 16:34.709
I think...

16:34.710 --> 16:36.623
I think she may have killed someone.

16:36.624 --> 16:39.084
I see. Uh...

16:39.821 --> 16:43.262
And is this something that you
are trying to pursue legally?

16:43.263 --> 16:45.037
- Does it matter?
- Depends.

16:45.038 --> 16:48.646
The work I do, uh, let's just say it...

16:48.647 --> 16:51.275
Wouldn't be admissible
in a court of law.

16:51.276 --> 16:53.628
- It's illegal.
- Well, no, I didn't say that.

16:53.629 --> 16:55.691
I said it wasn't admissible.

16:55.692 --> 16:58.692
You still interested?

17:01.261 --> 17:02.771
Yes.

17:02.772 --> 17:06.192
Can you hold on a second?

17:08.513 --> 17:13.374
I'm sorry. I'm gonna
have to call you back.

17:17.051 --> 17:18.318
Wow.

17:18.319 --> 17:20.728
That's a big commitment, changing teams.

17:20.729 --> 17:25.126
This is just the tip of
the iceberg, my friend.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.444
I told Lucy about us,

17:27.445 --> 17:30.811
and she was so excited, she
hugged me for ten minutes straight.

17:30.812 --> 17:33.892
If I knew I'd get so much love from
that girl, I would've told her ages ago.

17:33.893 --> 17:36.271
I'm glad it went well.

17:36.272 --> 17:39.839
Also, uh, Joss is throwing
an impromptu party tomorrow,

17:39.840 --> 17:42.561
and I want you to come and
officially meet my friends.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.687
- And you'll get to meet Janet, too.
- Who's Janet?

17:44.688 --> 17:46.349
Savi and Joss' mom. She's great.

17:46.350 --> 17:48.099
Lucy thinks she hung the moon.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.669
Oh, and you should bring Madi with you.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.390
Are you trying to prove
something here, April?

17:53.391 --> 17:55.391
I know I broke your trust.

17:55.392 --> 17:57.541
I want to earn it back.

17:57.542 --> 18:01.142
Well... it's totally working.

18:03.807 --> 18:07.767
I have a sitter for another hour.

18:13.505 --> 18:15.999
Opened a bottle. Wanted to share.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.884
Oh, that's sweet, mom, but if I
drink this late, I'll be up all night.

18:19.885 --> 18:22.030
Plus, I have all this work
that I have to get through.

18:22.031 --> 18:25.123
Well, you certainly didn't get
the responsibility gene from me.

18:25.124 --> 18:26.344
No, I did not.

18:26.345 --> 18:30.545
Or from your father, for that matter.

18:30.819 --> 18:33.418
I don't think he was irresponsible, mom.

18:33.419 --> 18:34.855
I think he was just heartbroken.

18:34.856 --> 18:37.001
Too heartbroken to stick around for you?

18:37.002 --> 18:39.403
Well, you had a baby
with another man, so...

18:39.404 --> 18:42.589
And that baby was Joss.

18:42.590 --> 18:44.326
I don't regret it. Do you?

18:44.327 --> 18:47.714
Let's not do this right now, okay?

18:47.715 --> 18:50.715
Okay. It's a deal.

18:55.219 --> 18:58.985
Listen, um, I didn't want to say
anything in front of your sister

18:58.986 --> 19:03.359
because I know you girls
are in a thing, but, uh...

19:03.360 --> 19:08.731
I'm worried about you and
what's going on with Harry.

19:08.732 --> 19:10.726
It is what it is.

19:10.727 --> 19:13.189
That doesn't sound like you, Savi.

19:13.190 --> 19:18.290
You fight tooth and nail
for everything you want.

19:21.044 --> 19:23.094
You can tell me, Sweetie.

19:23.095 --> 19:24.974
I won't judge you.

19:24.975 --> 19:28.335
I'm always here for you.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.620
I just...

19:31.621 --> 19:33.481
I...

19:36.727 --> 19:40.987
Well, I'll let you get to your work.

19:43.462 --> 19:46.271
We can talk about Harry tomorrow...

19:46.272 --> 19:48.632
If you want.

19:48.633 --> 19:51.469
Good night, Sweetie.

19:51.470 --> 19:53.810
Night, mom.

19:58.130 --> 20:01.899
You realize I was at
your funeral, right?

20:01.900 --> 20:03.214
I know.

20:03.215 --> 20:05.879
What the hell are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in Florida.

20:05.880 --> 20:08.824
- I know.
- And so?

20:08.825 --> 20:10.455
So I haven't gone yet.

20:10.456 --> 20:13.093
I can see that. Why, exactly?

20:13.094 --> 20:14.893
I need to talk to April.

20:14.894 --> 20:16.567
April doesn't want to talk to you.

20:16.568 --> 20:20.136
- I believe she made that clear.
- She did.

20:20.137 --> 20:22.219
I was just hoping she might
have cooled down a bit.

20:22.220 --> 20:25.677
You think she's gonna cool
down after what you did to her?

20:25.678 --> 20:27.966
Are you out of your freaking mind?

20:27.967 --> 20:32.400
I'm still not leaving L.A. until I get
another chance to discuss things with her.

20:32.401 --> 20:34.986
- What do you want from me?
- Okay.

20:34.987 --> 20:37.778
So I went to talk to April this
morning, but she was with a guy.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.304
- Her boyfriend.
- And...

20:39.305 --> 20:41.405
Richard.

20:42.763 --> 20:44.595
Right.

20:44.596 --> 20:46.314
Right. She's got a boyfriend and

20:46.315 --> 20:48.398
she has her own shop and
she's got this whole life...

20:48.399 --> 20:49.964
Of course she has a life.

20:49.965 --> 20:52.659
You've been dead for three years.

20:52.660 --> 20:54.491
Karen...

20:54.492 --> 20:56.462
I need your help.

20:56.463 --> 20:59.327
You've always been the
reasonable one of the group.

20:59.328 --> 21:02.860
Just give her the heads-up that
I haven't left and I want to talk.

21:02.861 --> 21:05.469
If you can convince her to have
one more conversation with me,

21:05.470 --> 21:08.523
I'll take care of the rest.

21:08.524 --> 21:10.161
Why on Earth should I help you, Paul?

21:10.162 --> 21:12.506
Because I don't think she wants me
surprising her at her door again,

21:12.507 --> 21:17.067
but if that's what I have to do, then...

21:20.596 --> 21:23.116
Please, Karen.

21:37.517 --> 21:40.452
- Who's coming?
- Oh, all the usual suspects.

21:40.453 --> 21:41.754
Is something burning?

21:41.755 --> 21:43.756
My pao de queijo!

21:43.757 --> 21:44.957
Uh-oh.

21:44.958 --> 21:46.491
Wow.

21:46.492 --> 21:48.160
Cheese balls, honey?

21:48.161 --> 21:49.995
You said it, not me.

21:49.996 --> 21:51.396
Too much?

21:51.397 --> 21:53.255
Not enough.

21:53.256 --> 21:54.584
I should probably go change, huh?

21:54.585 --> 21:56.526
Oh, there's no time. Our
first guest is here. Hi.

21:56.527 --> 21:59.695
- Hello. Hi.
- Oh, you look pretty.

21:59.696 --> 22:01.264
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:01.265 --> 22:03.675
Is April here yet? I
need to talk to her.

22:03.676 --> 22:04.978
No.

22:04.979 --> 22:08.038
- Karen, bem vindo.
- Janet. It's so good to see you.

22:08.039 --> 22:10.722
You look gorgeous.

22:10.723 --> 22:13.144
Tell me everything.
How's your love life?

22:13.145 --> 22:17.553
Oh. Hey, Joss. Over here.
I'll take one of those.

22:17.554 --> 22:20.748
Well, I obviously have the right house.

22:20.749 --> 22:22.893
Oh, my God. My mother hired a stripper.

22:22.894 --> 22:25.611
He's not a stripper. He's a bartender.

22:25.612 --> 22:28.348
- Hola. Diego, is it?
- Yes, Ma'am. Hola.

22:28.349 --> 22:30.249
Ma'am doesn't live here. I'm Janet.

22:30.250 --> 22:32.314
- Hey, guys. You remember Richard.
- Hi.

22:32.315 --> 22:34.443
- Mm hmm.
- Janet!

22:34.444 --> 22:38.104
Oh, my gosh. You're a giant.

22:38.946 --> 22:41.431
Uh, Diego, would you grab my camera?

22:41.432 --> 22:43.502
All right, everybody. Group picture.

22:43.503 --> 22:45.695
Don't by shy, handsome.

22:45.696 --> 22:49.094
- All right.
- And everybody say...

22:49.095 --> 22:50.469
Rio.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.330
Rio!

22:57.109 --> 22:59.089
Hello.

22:59.393 --> 23:01.810
Hi, Mr. Mitchell.

23:01.811 --> 23:05.584
Uh, no. I wasn't planning on
coming into the office today.

23:05.585 --> 23:08.405
Do you need me...

23:09.439 --> 23:12.499
When did that happen?

23:12.592 --> 23:15.949
New evidence in the Thomas Grey case.

23:15.950 --> 23:21.650
But Dr. Kim's notes were
handed in, like, two weeks ago.

23:21.729 --> 23:24.007
Você tem pés bonitos.

23:24.008 --> 23:25.431
Can I join the party?

23:25.432 --> 23:28.432
Mm. Oh, sure, honey.

23:31.195 --> 23:33.475
All right.

23:33.646 --> 23:37.966
- He's cute, mom.
- I hadn't noticed.

23:39.386 --> 23:40.953
I'm really glad you're here.

23:40.954 --> 23:43.388
- I missed having a mama.
- Oh.

23:43.389 --> 23:45.662
I can't believe you're gonna
be so far away for so long.

23:45.663 --> 23:48.138
You can always come visit.

23:48.139 --> 23:49.810
Well, actually...

23:49.811 --> 23:53.409
I was thinking I could come visit now.

23:53.410 --> 23:55.868
Help you find a place,
get you all set up.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.356
It'd be a blast.

23:57.357 --> 23:59.279
Well, what about your
job, your new girlfriend?

23:59.280 --> 24:02.841
Oh, I have two weeks of vacation coming to
me, and Alex would totally be supportive.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.740
Well...

24:04.741 --> 24:06.080
Unless you don't want me to come.

24:06.081 --> 24:09.317
Oh, are you kidding, honey?
I would love nothing more.

24:09.318 --> 24:11.852
- Yeah?
- You're my girl.

24:11.853 --> 24:13.773
Okay.

24:20.041 --> 24:24.048
Did you see how cute
Richard was being with Janet?

24:24.049 --> 24:28.352
He is so good with parents. I think
even my mother would like... him.

24:28.353 --> 24:30.273
What?

24:30.956 --> 24:33.124
Did you wind up telling
Richard about Paul?

24:33.125 --> 24:34.789
No. You told me not to.

24:34.790 --> 24:37.750
I know, but not everyone
listens to my advice.

24:37.751 --> 24:39.254
I do.

24:39.255 --> 24:42.375
Paul's still in L.A.

24:42.519 --> 24:44.149
What?

24:44.150 --> 24:47.787
- What... how do you... what?
- I had the same reaction.

24:47.788 --> 24:50.397
- How do you know?
- He came to see me.

24:50.398 --> 24:51.929
What?!

24:51.930 --> 24:53.958
- I know.
- What?

24:53.959 --> 24:55.965
I wasn't sure if I
should tell you or not,

24:55.966 --> 24:58.905
but I thought you should know and
decide for yourself how to handle it.

24:58.906 --> 25:01.461
How to handle it? What am
I supposed to be handling?

25:01.462 --> 25:04.211
- Why is he still here?
- That I don't know.

25:04.212 --> 25:06.480
He just said he needed to talk to you.

25:06.481 --> 25:09.429
He's staying at the same motel.

25:09.430 --> 25:12.582
Oh, I'm so sorry, April.

25:12.583 --> 25:16.330
- Should I not have told you?
- No, no, no. I mean...

25:16.331 --> 25:19.050
Damn it. What am I supposed to do now?

25:19.051 --> 25:21.161
I have no idea.

25:21.162 --> 25:23.319
Am I supposed to talk to
him? Is that what this is?

25:23.320 --> 25:25.184
No, not if you don't want to.

25:25.185 --> 25:28.965
Do I have to tell Richard now?

25:32.256 --> 25:34.956
Son of a bitch.

25:42.744 --> 25:45.592
- What the hell happened?
- Nothing. Nothing has happened.

25:45.593 --> 25:47.239
I'm gone for one week,

25:47.240 --> 25:50.038
and I come back to find out that
I've lost my entire settlement?

25:50.039 --> 25:53.464
I understand you're upset, Mrs. Grey.
Just let me bring you up to speed.

25:53.465 --> 25:55.868
Now new evidence has
recently emerged that seems

25:55.869 --> 25:58.295
to imply that your
husband may have been...

25:58.296 --> 26:01.387
Suicidal at the time of his death.

26:01.388 --> 26:02.547
That's ridiculous.

26:02.548 --> 26:05.691
These notes were submitted by your
husband's psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Kim.

26:05.692 --> 26:07.835
And in a few places, she
indicates that he had said...

26:07.836 --> 26:10.956
Let me see the notes.

26:11.996 --> 26:13.357
Well, this is impossible.

26:13.358 --> 26:16.163
Of course, this is just one woman's
opinion, we're prepared to argue...

26:16.164 --> 26:20.447
No, it's impossible that she
took these when she said she did.

26:20.448 --> 26:21.945
I'm sorry?

26:21.946 --> 26:27.846
These notes are referring to a session
that seemingly took place January 28th.

26:28.381 --> 26:32.816
Tom and I were in Hawaii the
last two weeks of January.

26:32.817 --> 26:34.255
You're sure about that?

26:34.256 --> 26:36.920
I keep all our receipts on file.

26:36.921 --> 26:39.056
I can show you a copy from our hotel.

26:39.057 --> 26:41.491
No, I apologize. I haven't
been lead on this case.

26:41.492 --> 26:43.470
Mrs. Davis is out with
the flu, and I just...

26:43.471 --> 26:46.793
Look, I don't care which
one of you fixes this.

26:46.794 --> 26:49.178
I just want it fixed.

26:49.179 --> 26:52.095
Obviously, this woman is lying.

26:52.096 --> 26:55.614
Now why would someone want to
do such a thing, I have no idea.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.718
But I expect you to find out.

26:57.719 --> 26:59.598
I assure you, we'll get
to the bottom of this.

26:59.599 --> 27:04.819
Please have a seat, and
I'll go get Mr. Mitchell.

27:13.177 --> 27:16.357
All right. Here we go.

27:17.660 --> 27:19.728
Guess what.

27:19.729 --> 27:21.264
I'm going to Rio.

27:21.265 --> 27:24.808
Are these rice balls or cod fritters?

27:24.809 --> 27:26.254
They are cod fritters.

27:26.255 --> 27:29.313
Go on. Go ahead and tell me the nine
million reasons why it's a bad idea.

27:29.314 --> 27:32.712
Actually, I think it's a great idea. You
should go, you will have a great time.

27:32.713 --> 27:33.515
Ow!

27:33.516 --> 27:35.522
Uh, do you want me to get
some butter or something?

27:35.523 --> 27:38.425
You don't use butter or ice.

27:38.426 --> 27:40.106
Run that under cold water.

27:40.107 --> 27:41.825
Hi.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.015
What are you doing here?

27:43.016 --> 27:45.544
Mom harassed him to come
over and say his good-byes.

27:45.545 --> 27:48.425
Give me your hand.

27:49.749 --> 27:51.600
It'll mean a lot to her that you came.

27:51.601 --> 27:56.041
Well, I always did have
a soft spot for Janet.

27:56.042 --> 27:58.562
There you go.

27:59.014 --> 28:01.527
Are you, uh...

28:01.528 --> 28:03.460
Are you gonna tell her you're pregnant?

28:03.461 --> 28:06.901
No. What would be the point?

28:06.902 --> 28:09.199
Might be nice to have someone around.

28:09.200 --> 28:14.603
Well, that's not really an
option, since she's moving to Rio.

28:14.604 --> 28:16.597
Well, maybe if you told
her, she wouldn't go.

28:16.598 --> 28:19.265
She'd be bored within
a week. Gone within two.

28:19.266 --> 28:21.407
At least give her a chance
to do the right thing, Sav.

28:21.408 --> 28:24.343
After all these years, do
you really not know her?

28:24.344 --> 28:29.347
Well, I've been surprised by people
lately that I thought I knew well.

28:29.348 --> 28:32.468
I'm gonna go say hi.

28:32.751 --> 28:35.407
Ready or not, here we come!

28:35.408 --> 28:36.822
He's not here.

28:36.823 --> 28:40.395
Oh, uh, check the kitchen again.

28:40.396 --> 28:43.996
- Hi, mom. Bye, mom.
- Okay.

28:44.322 --> 28:45.480
Psst.

28:45.481 --> 28:46.714
Let's check in here.

28:46.715 --> 28:49.295
Are they gone?

28:51.979 --> 28:55.018
You know, this game's not that bad
when you're just a little drunk.

28:55.019 --> 28:57.412
I'll have to remember that.

28:57.413 --> 28:59.532
You okay? You look kind of funny?

28:59.533 --> 29:02.599
I know. I'm... I'm sorry. I...

29:02.600 --> 29:04.401
I don't think I feel so good. I, um,

29:04.402 --> 29:06.405
I think I'm coming down
with Lucy's stomach flu.

29:06.406 --> 29:08.872
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, I'd hate to break up the party.

29:08.873 --> 29:11.975
- Everyone's having such a good time.
- How about I take the girls tonight?

29:11.976 --> 29:14.926
That way, you can go
home and puke in private.

29:14.927 --> 29:18.947
Oh, really? You're okay with that?

29:20.750 --> 29:23.930
I'll rally the troops.

29:31.188 --> 29:34.173
Thank you for the
great party. I gotta go.

29:34.174 --> 29:35.662
- Careful driving.
- Yeah, me, too.

29:35.663 --> 29:37.556
Oh, don't be such a poop.

29:37.557 --> 29:38.895
Come on. Stay the night.

29:38.896 --> 29:40.518
Oh, n... mom, it's okay.

29:40.519 --> 29:44.225
No, the three of us
will stay up and talk.

29:44.226 --> 29:46.378
Oh, come on, you two.

29:46.379 --> 29:49.901
You love each other too much
to let your egos keep you apart.

29:49.902 --> 29:52.258
- People make mistakes.
- Mom, let's clean up.

29:52.259 --> 29:55.828
Well, it... it's no big surprise
that men can't keep it in their pants.

29:55.829 --> 29:56.971
- Mom.
- Mom!

29:56.972 --> 30:00.785
- Okay, kids. Let's go to the car.
- Right behind you.

30:00.786 --> 30:02.002
Is that what you told her?

30:02.003 --> 30:04.919
No. Of course that's not what I
told her. I didn't tell her anything.

30:04.920 --> 30:06.853
I didn't need to be told.

30:06.854 --> 30:09.312
Marriages break up over
one of two things...

30:09.313 --> 30:10.891
Money or cheating.

30:10.892 --> 30:14.397
Obviously, money's not an issue.
I mean... Look at this house.

30:14.398 --> 30:16.909
So somebody slept with somebody else.

30:16.910 --> 30:20.090
What else could it be?

30:25.694 --> 30:27.554
You?

30:36.541 --> 30:38.461
Savi.

30:41.072 --> 30:43.183
- Savi.
- Please just leave me alone.

30:43.184 --> 30:45.423
I didn't know. How could I know?

30:45.424 --> 30:48.338
I mean, after all the hell you gave
me for what I did to your father...

30:48.339 --> 30:50.828
And ten men after
that. It's not the same.

30:50.829 --> 30:53.217
Oh, I didn't mean that. I...

30:53.218 --> 30:55.933
I don't fault you. I don't care.

30:55.934 --> 30:58.869
Have I ever judged you,
Savi? I have never judged you.

30:58.870 --> 31:00.484
Nope. You have never judged me, mom,

31:00.485 --> 31:04.959
because that actually would
have required some attention.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.820
Wow.

31:06.824 --> 31:08.936
You really hate me?

31:08.937 --> 31:12.581
Was I such a terrible mother?

31:12.582 --> 31:14.382
No.

31:15.017 --> 31:17.643
You were a great mom
when you were there.

31:17.644 --> 31:19.931
But unfortunately, you
were hardly ever there.

31:19.932 --> 31:23.111
What are you talking about? I was
always there when you girls needed me.

31:23.112 --> 31:26.082
- Are you kidding me?
- Name one time when I wasn't there.

31:26.083 --> 31:27.473
One? Okay.

31:27.474 --> 31:30.783
Uh, what about Joss' 7th birthday?

31:30.784 --> 31:32.402
You didn't give her that necklace, mom.

31:32.403 --> 31:34.918
Of course I gave her the necklace.
It was her birthday present.

31:34.919 --> 31:38.631
You were in Cabo with
some guy we had never met.

31:38.632 --> 31:43.206
And you left me alone once
again to take care of her.

31:43.207 --> 31:45.773
I was 15 years old, and she was 7.

31:45.774 --> 31:48.312
And she pestered me the whole weekend...

31:48.313 --> 31:52.087
"What do you think mom's gonna
bring me back for my birthday?"

31:52.088 --> 31:54.389
And I knew you'd forget.

31:54.390 --> 31:59.010
I knew it, if you'd even show up at all.

31:59.628 --> 32:02.480
And I just... I couldn't... I couldn't
bear the heartbreak on her face

32:02.481 --> 32:05.976
so I took every single
penny that I had saved.

32:05.977 --> 32:11.877
And I bought her that necklace
and I just said it was from you.

32:13.920 --> 32:17.520
The necklace wasn't from me?

32:25.000 --> 32:27.122
Well, I...

32:27.123 --> 32:29.583
Did my best.

33:07.530 --> 33:09.697
Thanks for calling me.

33:09.698 --> 33:12.094
I didn't invite you in.

33:12.095 --> 33:14.555
Right. Sorry.

33:15.393 --> 33:17.677
Force of habit.

33:17.678 --> 33:21.338
Why are you still here, Paul?

33:22.319 --> 33:25.319
I want to see Lucy.

33:47.933 --> 33:50.933
- Morning.
- Morning.

33:56.242 --> 33:59.662
I'm sorry about yesterday.

33:59.764 --> 34:04.733
I don't see you often,
which is on me, I know.

34:04.734 --> 34:09.228
And I feel like I have such a short
window to say all the right things.

34:09.228 --> 34:13.192
And invariably, they come out all wrong.

34:13.193 --> 34:15.893
It's okay, mom.

34:17.677 --> 34:20.677
You're not like me.

34:21.348 --> 34:23.795
And what I was trying
to say the other night...

34:23.797 --> 34:26.937
About you not being like your father...

34:26.938 --> 34:30.397
You're so much stronger than he is...

34:30.398 --> 34:33.217
Than he ever was.

34:34.960 --> 34:40.329
You have always been your own
little miracle of a person.

34:40.330 --> 34:45.730
In so many ways, let's face
it, you raised yourself.

34:47.248 --> 34:50.793
Your accomplishments are all your own.

34:50.793 --> 34:54.094
And I am absolute awe...

34:54.291 --> 34:58.191
Of the woman that you've become.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.534
A cheater?

35:02.535 --> 35:04.962
A woman of great character.

35:04.963 --> 35:08.203
Who's facing a mistake.

35:11.804 --> 35:13.724
Yeah.

35:15.096 --> 35:17.645
I'm sorry about interfering
with you and Harry.

35:17.646 --> 35:21.528
I... I hope you two work it out.

35:21.529 --> 35:27.169
You have a bond I could never
forge with another person.

35:28.938 --> 35:34.638
And I've always thought you'd
make an outstanding mother.

35:47.175 --> 35:52.695
You better hurry, though,
before those eggs go and die.

35:55.702 --> 36:01.140
I've done some preliminary
work on this Elizabeth Grey.

36:01.141 --> 36:02.459
You want some coffee?

36:02.460 --> 36:05.040
No, thank you.

36:06.408 --> 36:08.675
You didn't say she was loaded.

36:08.676 --> 36:10.312
Does that matter?

36:10.313 --> 36:15.053
Well, gated communities
have tighter security.

36:15.926 --> 36:18.756
- You know anything about firewalls?
- Not really.

36:18.757 --> 36:20.993
Well, I won't trouble
you with the details.

36:20.994 --> 36:24.243
Let's just say that this
whole thing is going to, uh,

36:24.244 --> 36:28.211
take a little longer
than I initially thought.

36:28.212 --> 36:29.728
Oh, really?

36:29.729 --> 36:33.060
So you're saying her I.S.P.
provides better security

36:33.061 --> 36:37.114
because there's a gate
in front of her house?

36:37.115 --> 36:39.875
Well, obviously...

36:39.945 --> 36:42.027
I was speaking of the
metaphorical firewall.

36:42.028 --> 36:44.321
Look, if you don't
have any information...

36:44.322 --> 36:46.531
Look, I can get you a whole
bunch of facts on this lady.

36:46.532 --> 36:49.164
But none of 'em are gonna give
you the answer you're looking for.

36:49.165 --> 36:53.344
I'm not gonna find an e-mail
that says, "I killed my husband".

36:53.345 --> 36:58.468
I'm a good P.I., but I'm not a mind
reader. I can't get inside her head.

36:58.469 --> 37:00.676
Thank you for your time.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.873
Why don't you just ask her yourself?

37:02.874 --> 37:05.042
There's no point. I
already know she lies.

37:05.043 --> 37:07.372
Well, everybody lies.

37:07.373 --> 37:13.273
But you seem to have a pretty good
knack for cutting through people's crap.

37:21.026 --> 37:23.911
Richard, hi. What are you doing here?

37:23.912 --> 37:27.673
Chicken soup, which is either perfect
or gross, depending on how you feel.

37:27.674 --> 37:31.505
If it's gross, I also brought bagels.

37:31.506 --> 37:33.474
You're a good man.

37:33.475 --> 37:35.515
I try.

37:38.713 --> 37:41.050
Come in. There's...

37:41.051 --> 37:44.711
Something I need to tell you.

37:55.482 --> 37:57.123
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:57.124 --> 37:58.953
I thought you had to go
into the office today.

37:58.954 --> 38:00.806
Yeah, I'm leaving soon.

38:00.807 --> 38:04.347
Just wanted to see you off.

38:08.284 --> 38:10.925
- Where's mom?
- I don't know, she's uh...

38:10.926 --> 38:13.920
She's not answering her phone.
She's not in the guest house but,

38:13.921 --> 38:16.870
maybe she just went to go get
cash for the trip, you know?

38:16.871 --> 38:19.785
Yeah. You're probably right.

38:19.786 --> 38:22.606
Oh. There she is.

38:22.891 --> 38:24.850
Hola, mama. ¿Cómo estás?

38:24.851 --> 38:26.342
Where you at?

38:26.343 --> 38:30.363
Oh, you're at the airport already?

38:30.939 --> 38:32.919
Diego?

38:33.066 --> 38:38.319
Oh, oh, the... yeah the, right,
the bartender from last night. Yeah.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.394
Oh, well...

38:40.395 --> 38:43.398
Yeah, that's probably a smart
idea. He knows the city and...

38:43.399 --> 38:46.923
He can... Lug all your
boxes and stuff and...

38:46.924 --> 38:49.264
Yeah. Um...

38:49.502 --> 38:50.589
No. Yeah.

38:50.590 --> 38:53.984
Let's be honest. He's pretty hot, right?

38:53.985 --> 38:55.867
Okay.

38:55.868 --> 38:57.732
Um... yeah.

38:57.733 --> 39:01.433
Actually, it's... it's
probably better for me to...

39:01.434 --> 39:04.909
To come when you're
all settled in and...

39:04.910 --> 39:06.544
I don't know what we were thinking.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.215
Totally, yeah.

39:08.216 --> 39:09.247
Okay.

39:09.248 --> 39:10.948
Okay.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.738
Yeah, we'll make a
girls' weekend out of it.

39:12.739 --> 39:15.139
Okay. Ciao.

39:28.862 --> 39:30.996
She's taking Diego. Bleh.

39:30.997 --> 39:33.157
I heard.

39:34.901 --> 39:37.066
God, she couldn't like...

39:37.067 --> 39:42.107
Be a mom for just a
couple of weeks, you know?

39:50.055 --> 39:52.401
Now I finally understand why you've...

39:52.402 --> 39:55.143
- Always been so frickin' tough on me.
- Oh, Joss, please don't...

39:55.144 --> 40:00.036
No, no, no, just stop, because
it's gonna get nice, I promise.

40:00.037 --> 40:04.902
You've been so tough on me
because that's what mothers do.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.838
You know, to...

40:06.839 --> 40:10.799
Make sure that you grow up right.

40:16.548 --> 40:19.368
Oh. I missed you.

40:20.462 --> 40:23.342
I missed you, too.

40:28.751 --> 40:31.964
I need you to do something for me, okay?

40:31.965 --> 40:33.885
Yeah.

40:45.881 --> 40:50.441
This is the results
to my paternity test.

40:52.804 --> 40:56.844
- You want to open it now?
- There's no good answer in there.

40:56.845 --> 40:58.907
I mean, if it's...

40:58.908 --> 41:01.068
Dom's...

41:01.172 --> 41:02.506
What?

41:02.507 --> 41:05.709
I'm not gonna be in a
relationship with him.

41:05.710 --> 41:08.472
But if it's Harry's, well...

41:08.473 --> 41:13.800
I certainly don't want him to
come home just for this baby.

41:13.801 --> 41:18.170
My job now is to take care of this baby.

41:18.171 --> 41:21.291
In love and in peace.

41:22.571 --> 41:26.351
And until he or she is born...

41:26.481 --> 41:29.721
The baby belongs to me.

41:35.241 --> 41:38.721
Will you keep this for me?

41:39.185 --> 41:42.314
There is no one in this world...

41:42.315 --> 41:46.017
That I trust more with it than you.

41:46.018 --> 41:47.670
- Okay?
- Yeah.

41:47.671 --> 41:49.591
Okay.

41:57.423 --> 42:02.082
Hi, Lila. Uh, sorry to do this, but I
need to cancel my afternoon appointments.

42:02.083 --> 42:07.091
I'm heading out to Zuma and I'm
not sure what time I'll be back.

42:07.092 --> 42:08.286
Great.

42:08.287 --> 42:10.567
Thank you.

42:14.139 --> 42:16.063
Are you Karen Kim?

42:16.064 --> 42:20.504
- Yes, I am.
- You've just been served.

42:28.943 --> 42:33.023
