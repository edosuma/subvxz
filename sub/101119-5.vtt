WEBVTT

00:05.172 --> 00:06.774
Previously on "P-Valley"...

00:07.007 --> 00:08.042
Montavious Hill?

00:08.075 --> 00:11.345
Oh, FEMA doesn't have anyone on record
with that name having been identified yet.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.050
Hands where I can see them.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.153
Hey, bitch!

00:19.186 --> 00:20.154
Bitch, what the hell?

00:20.187 --> 00:21.522
What'd I say?

00:21.555 --> 00:23.023
Hands where I can see 'em.

00:24.291 --> 00:27.328
There might be one small,
little, tiny problem

00:27.361 --> 00:28.696
with the owner of The Pynk.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.798
The owner may have found out
about the casino.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.234
I'm still paying off a debt
I took up on this place.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.102
Can you get me the down payment
by tomorrow?

00:35.136 --> 00:36.237
Tomorrow?

00:36.270 --> 00:37.705
You made the withdrawal
from the church account yet?

00:37.738 --> 00:38.739
What you need it for?

00:38.773 --> 00:40.241
What your little ass gonna do with it?

00:40.274 --> 00:43.110
I'm sorry, baby, but another buyer's done
already swooped in and got it.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.514
Fuck you, bitch!

00:46.547 --> 00:48.249
Where's this bitch at?

00:48.282 --> 00:50.518
All right, now, which one of y'all heifers
gon' go on for Beyoncé?

00:50.551 --> 00:52.052
I'll do it.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.287
That's my song.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.256
That's my song!

00:55.289 --> 00:56.624
You know that shit about you, right?

01:04.832 --> 01:08.769
Miss M-I-crooked letter-crooked letter-I,

01:08.803 --> 01:13.641
crooked letter-crooked letter-I,
humpback-humpback-I!

01:16.544 --> 01:17.678
That's right!

01:17.711 --> 01:22.616
Miss Mississippi in a minute!

01:22.650 --> 01:24.785
Let's run that bop back
one more 'gain one time

01:24.819 --> 01:29.223
for the one-time rewind!

01:29.256 --> 01:31.392
She almost better than Mercedes.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.794
Ooh, Lordy, don't you
be blaspheming up in here.

01:33.828 --> 01:35.596
Over love.

01:35.629 --> 01:38.866
I usually choose the money over love

01:39.099 --> 01:42.603
Yeah, you can have it, I don't give a fuck

01:42.636 --> 01:45.706
Tonight she got me about to give it up

01:45.739 --> 01:48.809
- Every buck, all because
- All because.

01:48.843 --> 01:50.811
Which one of y'all the new divorcée?

01:50.845 --> 01:53.547
Right here, and I'm spending

01:53.581 --> 01:57.318
this whole divorce settlement
tonight, bitches!

01:57.351 --> 01:58.519
Hey!

01:59.320 --> 02:00.754
To new motherfucking beginnings!

02:00.788 --> 02:03.824
To new motherfucking beginnings!

02:43.497 --> 02:46.834
You are truly the most beautiful woman

02:46.867 --> 02:48.702
I ever seen.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.673
And you smell like a baby.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.579
He just left me!

03:01.248 --> 03:05.886
Well, he ain't deserve a generous
and genuine woman like you.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.557
You ain't have to drop half
your divorce settlement on me,

03:09.590 --> 03:11.559
and, like, yet you did.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.628
Somebody gonna snatch you up soon enough.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.764
No, they won't.

03:17.731 --> 03:21.368
I don't want to go back
to that big old empty house by myself.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.571
I don't want to go. I don't want to go!

03:23.604 --> 03:25.873
I don't want to go! I don't want to go!

03:25.906 --> 03:27.975
I don't want to go! I don't want to go!

03:28.208 --> 03:31.312
Hey, hey, God can't give you
your blessings

03:31.345 --> 03:34.248
if you up there holding a bag of shit.

03:35.349 --> 03:38.919
You gon' have to release that doo-doo
and take your blessings to go, boo.

03:38.953 --> 03:41.455
Now, that's something
we all can learn from.

03:41.956 --> 03:43.457
Gidget!

03:43.490 --> 03:45.326
If you don't get your ass
out of my face...

03:45.359 --> 03:47.461
I'm talking to the lady,
and you jokin' and shit, and...

03:53.567 --> 03:55.603
Girl...

03:58.238 --> 03:59.907
Let's get this bag.

06:29.089 --> 06:32.626
Over love

06:32.659 --> 06:35.596
I usually choose the money

06:35.629 --> 06:39.733
Over love, yeah

06:39.767 --> 06:41.568
Yeah, you can have it

06:41.602 --> 06:44.738
I don't give a fuck

06:46.507 --> 06:51.445
She got me about to give it up

06:51.879 --> 06:52.813
Hey.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.920
All done. All done.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.926
I told Uncle Clifford this shit
wasn't long for the world.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.162
Pynk being 'closed on? For real?

07:08.829 --> 07:10.597
How long you done know about this, man?

07:14.468 --> 07:17.004
Well, look who laughing at a funeral.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.742
Oh, well, this sad and all, but look.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.044
Somebody done posted a video
of me from last night.

07:24.077 --> 07:27.214
This shit done got, like, 10,386 views.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.551
How I'ma finish paying for nursing school?

07:30.584 --> 07:31.718
What I'm finna do, y'all?

07:31.752 --> 07:33.620
What we all gon' do?

07:34.721 --> 07:36.523
Over love!

07:37.124 --> 07:40.160
Yeah, you can... Over love...

07:41.695 --> 07:46.533
- Watch it!
- I usually choose the money over love.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.775
What y'all standing lollygagging for?

07:55.709 --> 07:57.811
Oh, Lord, don't tell me, Mercedes dead.

07:57.845 --> 07:58.812
She dead.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.047
Mercedes dead!

08:00.080 --> 08:01.181
Look.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.884
Foreclosure?

08:05.485 --> 08:09.690
14 days till auction?

08:15.662 --> 08:19.099
Last night, a local pastor was attacked
by an exotic dancer

08:19.132 --> 08:20.767
in front of the club...

08:20.801 --> 08:23.670
- Your account is frozen.
- What does that mean?

08:23.704 --> 08:26.540
That means that you're not allowed
to do any more transfers.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.609
What do you mean
I'm not allowed any more transfers?

08:28.642 --> 08:30.510
Apologies, Miss Savage,
but our records show

08:30.544 --> 08:32.613
that you've done over ten
in the past few days.

08:32.646 --> 08:34.915
Yeah, that's because
y'all allow unlimited transfers

08:34.948 --> 08:37.050
as long as the amount is under $9,000.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.253
- Well, things have changed.
- Why?

08:39.286 --> 08:41.989
The only reason we had
that policy in place

08:42.022 --> 08:43.991
was because we knew folks
was trying to get back on their feet

08:44.024 --> 08:45.659
after the flood.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.628
We wanted to help folks
wire money to their families,

08:47.661 --> 08:50.097
but as of today, it stops.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.099
So y'all just think, in two months,

08:52.132 --> 08:53.567
we can all just pull
our lives back together...

08:53.600 --> 08:56.069
Look, Miss Savage, it was a courtesy,

08:56.103 --> 08:59.273
which, quite frankly,
folks should be grateful for.

09:00.240 --> 09:04.678
Mm, seems like your family
has been very, very generous.

09:05.245 --> 09:08.181
But as of today, the policy is changed.

09:09.249 --> 09:12.686
- Look, is there anything...
- What the hell?

09:12.719 --> 09:16.556
Lord, have mercy!
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel!

09:18.191 --> 09:20.127
Thank you, Jesus.

09:30.304 --> 09:33.206
Her own bag, I don't need to save her

09:33.240 --> 09:35.909
Rolling in ass papers

09:35.943 --> 09:37.778
The stage and naughty by nature

09:37.811 --> 09:40.080
I need me a bitch that's doin' it major

09:40.113 --> 09:42.749
I'm just saying, y'all done had me
sitting up here all night,

09:42.783 --> 09:44.017
and I still ain't got my phone call yet.

09:44.051 --> 09:44.985
Pay phone broke.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.620
I need to call my lawyers,
Bufford and Bienvenue.

09:46.653 --> 09:48.722
Yeah, you and every other
nigga up in here.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.190
Yeah, you can have it

09:50.223 --> 09:53.226
I don't give a fuck

09:53.260 --> 09:55.796
Who sing that song?

09:55.829 --> 09:57.664
Lil Murda.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.934
- Lil Murda?
- Well, keep it that way.

10:02.736 --> 10:06.773
Look, I can't be hemmed up in the 201
over the whole weekend, now.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.008
Well, you should've been thinking
about that

10:08.041 --> 10:09.309
before you beat
your mama's ass last night.

10:09.343 --> 10:12.079
You don't know Patrice Woodbine.
She stole from me.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.082
Pluckin' and finessin'
must run in the family

10:15.115 --> 10:17.851
since I have yet to get
my wallet returned back to me.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.221
Jesse?

10:21.254 --> 10:22.289
Oh, hell!

10:23.156 --> 10:24.725
Over love

10:25.792 --> 10:28.996
I usually choose the money over love

10:30.864 --> 10:32.299
Yeah, you can have it

10:32.332 --> 10:34.868
I don't give a fuck

10:35.702 --> 10:39.740
Tonight she got me about to give it up

10:40.707 --> 10:42.009
All because...

10:50.984 --> 10:52.953
Show me that ass! Yeah! Come on!

10:56.056 --> 10:56.990
Jesse!

10:57.024 --> 10:59.292
- Talking shit.
- Jesse!

10:59.326 --> 11:01.128
Jesse!

11:01.161 --> 11:04.297
Jesse, will you please honor my request
to be moved to the ladies' cell?

11:04.331 --> 11:06.433
- It's not my call. God's call.
- Come on, man.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.902
I would let you ring Him up,
but the pay phone's broke.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.905
Hey, let me peep that.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.741
Oh, my God, what the fuck?

11:14.775 --> 11:16.743
Y'all put that phone up
and get back to work.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.761
Get this heifer off of me!

11:34.795 --> 11:36.797
Good Lord, maybe I am
better off over here.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.932
You fucking bitch!

11:40.367 --> 11:42.102
You want to add murder in the first

11:42.135 --> 11:44.237
to assault, disorderly behavior,
and resisting arrest?

11:44.271 --> 11:46.039
That officer ran into my fist.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.174
Just like your mama did, huh?

11:47.207 --> 11:48.341
Your mama?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.410
Wait, this her mama?

11:50.444 --> 11:52.045
I don't care what she do.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.980
You don't raise a hand to your mama.

11:54.014 --> 11:57.017
Yeah, I'd split these two up, but we got
a sewage backup in number three,

11:57.050 --> 11:58.418
and number four won't lock,

11:58.452 --> 12:00.821
so y'all gon' have to go along
to get along, you hear me?

12:01.288 --> 12:06.059
You stay over there in that corner,
and you stay over there, huh?

12:06.093 --> 12:08.762
You make sure these heifers don't cross
this 50-yard line, you hear?

12:08.795 --> 12:10.263
These folks like
two tornadoes in the alley,

12:10.297 --> 12:12.232
and you want us to stay in here with them?

12:12.265 --> 12:15.268
Well, you want to go over there
and join Nineveh, huh?

12:15.302 --> 12:16.736
I ain't think so.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.773
Now, I hear one more peep out of y'all,
and I'm stacking up everybody's charges!

12:21.074 --> 12:22.142
I didn't do shit!

12:23.910 --> 12:24.945
Can he do that?

12:27.180 --> 12:29.216
Jesse can do anything he wanna.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.251
Round here, he's the boss.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.886
Children nowadays...

12:32.919 --> 12:35.489
ain't got no respect for they elders.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.023
Ain't that a shame?

12:37.057 --> 12:38.992
Yeah, it's all right, baby.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.795
It's all right.

12:44.498 --> 12:45.866
You say what, now?

12:45.899 --> 12:49.302
My wife went missing
the day Hurricane Drake hit.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.538
Afterwards, I couldn't get
the Houston police to do anything, so...

12:51.771 --> 12:54.908
Well, I can only imagine
how overwhelmed they was.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.843
So she been missing for two months now?

12:57.777 --> 13:00.180
Yeah. Ever since the flood.

13:01.014 --> 13:04.484
Well, son, Chucalissa's
two worlds away from Houston.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.386
Guess that's how far hope's carried me.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.089
I visited
every town along the river,

13:09.122 --> 13:12.325
thinking maybe, maybe...

13:14.461 --> 13:17.864
I lost so much, sir. I lost everything.

13:19.866 --> 13:21.201
Well, look...

13:22.202 --> 13:23.503
I'll tell you what.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.907
If you have a picture you can email us,

13:26.940 --> 13:29.543
I'll get my deputies to put up some flyers

13:29.576 --> 13:32.045
around town quick-fast, all right?

13:32.078 --> 13:33.847
Thank you kindly, sir.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.416
Now, hold on. I can't read that.
What is it?

13:37.951 --> 13:40.053
Who should I ask for if I get word back?

13:40.086 --> 13:42.122
Montavious.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.124
Montavious Hill.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.467
Sheriff Bailey,
I tried to hem him up at the gate.

13:55.569 --> 13:57.404
How can I help you, Clifford?

13:58.238 --> 14:00.874
"If the owner does not vacate
the said premises

14:00.907 --> 14:03.543
in 14 days by date of auction,

14:03.577 --> 14:06.112
the Sheriff's Office of Nonconnah County

14:06.146 --> 14:09.449
will evict said owner from the property"?

14:11.451 --> 14:13.086
Now, don't do that with your nails.

14:15.055 --> 14:18.258
All right, come on. Alex, let her back.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.528
The devil stay busy, don't he?

14:21.561 --> 14:24.097
It wasn't me that rode down there
and put that on your door.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.932
That was one of my deputies.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.401
I was busy cleaning up
your right-awful mess.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.403
A mess made by me? Pray, do tell.

14:30.437 --> 14:34.274
I had to pull over a lady so lit,
I thought she was a fuckin' firecracker.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.109
Thank God I seen her when I did.

14:36.142 --> 14:37.877
Don't know how many folks
she would've killed last night

14:37.911 --> 14:42.048
swerving backward down Main Street
like she on 40 going north.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.284
Look, now, me and you...

14:45.318 --> 14:47.254
I thought we had come
to an understanding.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.089
I pay you, don't I?

14:49.122 --> 14:51.658
That you do, but you can't let folks
get so lubricated,

14:51.891 --> 14:53.360
they start acting a damn fool.

14:53.393 --> 14:57.097
You'd best tell Yoli to stop being
so damn heavy-handed.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.098
No...

14:58.131 --> 15:00.600
This little arrangement
between us gon' soon come to an end,

15:00.634 --> 15:02.235
you keep pushing past the limit.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.004
You'd really forgo our little arrangement?

15:04.037 --> 15:06.439
Look, I don't really like
Ruffin's new law.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.907
Okay.

15:07.941 --> 15:10.110
Look, I don't mind letting folks get
a little liquored.

15:10.143 --> 15:13.246
All laws ain't right,
but some rights is wrong.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.283
Run that back, Emmitt Smith.

15:16.316 --> 15:20.287
Well, all I'm saying is,
even if you had the right

15:20.320 --> 15:24.257
to put tequila with your titties,
think about what the Bible say.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.592
Oh, child.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.561
Now, you lucky a foreclosure notice
all you got last night.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.598
Why so short? 14 days?

15:31.631 --> 15:33.400
Well, you best talk to your boy Ruffin.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.101
- My boy?
- Yeah.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.002
Hey.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.704
Welcome to Bailey's Plantation, y'all.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.706
Y'all folks so goddamn sensitive.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.174
That ain't what I meant.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.710
Ruffin seem like he your boy.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.979
He got you doing his dirty work.

15:46.012 --> 15:48.114
Look, the mayor's office
can expedite a foreclosure

15:48.148 --> 15:51.451
in the case of properties
that they consider a community blight.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.452
Community blight?

15:52.485 --> 15:54.654
Do you know how many hoes
I done put through school?

15:54.688 --> 15:57.324
Well, that little community service
you done provided over the years

15:57.357 --> 16:01.628
just ain't gonna override all
the code violations you done racked up.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.364
Mayor Ruffin say The Pynk's gots to go.

16:04.397 --> 16:07.233
Is this shit even legal?

16:07.267 --> 16:09.369
Well, this Mississippi.
It legal enough.

16:09.402 --> 16:12.072
Now, if you don't mind, I got shit to do.

16:12.105 --> 16:15.342
The jail's so full,
the bars about to bend to breaking.

16:15.375 --> 16:20.213
Hell, even one of your dancers
got all lost up in the sauce last night.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.015
One of my girls?

16:22.048 --> 16:24.351
Yeah, Lexus or something.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.418
- Mercedes?
- Yeah.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.453
Wait, she up in here?

16:26.486 --> 16:28.455
Yeah, she up in here. So's her mama.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.524
Cutting up outside the Kroger
like it was a damn barbershop.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.126
Let me see her. Let me see her.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.495
No, you will see her when she posts bail.

16:35.528 --> 16:39.699
Sheriff Bailey, that girl is
like a daughter my ass can't ever have.

16:41.067 --> 16:43.069
You let me see Mercedes.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.078
I needs my phone call.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.047
- Excuse me, I needs...
- What up, baby?

16:54.080 --> 16:56.349
Hey, hey, baby, look over here.
Look over here.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.785
You see that? You see that right there?

16:59.586 --> 17:00.720
You like that?

17:04.758 --> 17:07.427
Come on, step to the right
and let me get a good look at you.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.430
Hey, told you I ain't have no dick.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.465
Hey, boy. Cut that shit out!

17:12.499 --> 17:16.136
I wonder if I put a quarter in her mouth,
would she sing some Aretha?

17:16.169 --> 17:18.371
You gon' have to put more
than a quarter in this mouth,

17:18.405 --> 17:20.206
you want some Aretha.

17:20.740 --> 17:24.344
You don't know what you mean

17:24.377 --> 17:26.045
Glad you know what it's worth.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.082
This ain't the club.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.520
Are you Mercedes?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.588
Did I die and go to Heaven?

17:35.622 --> 17:38.591
- No, bitch, this hell.
- Mercedes!

17:39.459 --> 17:43.563
I came all the way down from Tchulahoma
to see your last dance.

17:44.197 --> 17:48.435
I heard about it, and I knew that's
what I wanted to do for my divorce party,

17:48.468 --> 17:51.571
but they had some other girl
go on for you instead.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.606
Somebody danced in my place?

17:53.640 --> 17:58.111
Yeah, they called her
M-I-crooked letter-crooked letter-I...

17:58.144 --> 18:00.313
Hold it down. You have two minutes.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.249
Hey, girl, hey!

18:03.283 --> 18:05.385
- Hey--
- Uncle Clifford!

18:07.086 --> 18:08.455
You let Keyshawn go on for me?

18:08.488 --> 18:10.690
Mercedes, what the hell
was I supposed to do, huh?

18:10.723 --> 18:12.125
Let the niggas tear the club up?

18:12.158 --> 18:13.593
I mean, I like it when folks get crunk,

18:13.626 --> 18:16.429
but Lord knows I needs me
a building standin'.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.166
Well, how'd she do?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.334
Girl, she...

18:22.368 --> 18:23.770
She was all right.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.210
I need you to get me out of here.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.512
Oh, baby girl, come on.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.646
Hey.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.183
I'ma put some stacks on your bail.

18:37.684 --> 18:41.221
Yep, foreclosure be damned.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.289
Hold up. Foreclosure?

18:44.491 --> 18:45.892
The Pynk about to be auctioned?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.527
Woke up this mornin'...

18:48.628 --> 18:50.230
...to this sign.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.831
That's the only reason I'm down here.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.301
Then I found out about you
and old BA-trice.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.403
I bet you better keep my name
out your mouth.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.639
Don't you come
unless I send for you, girl.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.477
God, a funny-ass bitch, but damn.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.179
Sheriff Bailey know he need
to be ashamed of hisself,

19:06.212 --> 19:07.780
keeping both of y'all in the same cage.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.719
Let me pull my little pennies
together from my pocketbook...

19:12.752 --> 19:14.854
- Keep it.
- 'Cedes, we made some stacks.

19:14.888 --> 19:17.290
Keep it. Don't you owe 55K?

19:18.725 --> 19:22.362
You need to put every penny
you got down on The Pynk.

19:22.395 --> 19:25.598
Clifford, time's up.

19:28.568 --> 19:31.471
Let me go see if I can get
this runaway train turned round.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.775
Hey, come on. Stay strong.

19:36.776 --> 19:37.877
Stay strong.

19:41.447 --> 19:42.415
Yeah.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.554
And don't beat her ass again.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.390
You leave that to me.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.725
Well, ain't that nice?
A visit from your pimp.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.527
I got your pimp.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.898
- What?
- My pimp?

19:59.599 --> 20:01.200
You should be the one to talk.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.603
That woman done done more
for me in the last seven years

20:03.636 --> 20:05.505
than you done done in a whole lifetime.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.774
So that thing been
a better mother to you than me?

20:07.807 --> 20:08.775
Damn right!

20:08.808 --> 20:12.378
At least she ain't steal all my shit
and make herself a goddamn church!

20:13.780 --> 20:16.249
You want to talk about pimps?

20:16.282 --> 20:17.917
You need to be talking
about your damn self.

20:18.618 --> 20:22.488
I was just three and already had
a gas bill and Dillard's card.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.257
My mama did that to me, too.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.593
They say Jesus come like
a thief in the night?

20:28.328 --> 20:30.730
Well, they ain't met them
no Patrice Woodbine.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.633
God forgave me for that.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.303
You gon' have to forgive me
for that, too.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.439
It looks like y'all in luck.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.474
Pay phone's back in business.

20:41.507 --> 20:43.476
Now, who got some family
they want to call?

21:20.279 --> 21:21.347
Gidget?

21:21.881 --> 21:23.950
- Gidget!
- Almost done, Ma.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.359
Unknown Caller

21:35.361 --> 21:38.064
- We have a collect call from the...
- Chucalissa jail facility.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.399
- From...
- Bitch, come on.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.534
You know your number the only number
I got memorized.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.603
To accept charges, press one.

21:46.706 --> 21:49.042
Now, why in the world would you get
to scrapping with your mama

21:49.075 --> 21:50.910
on the night of your last dance?

21:50.943 --> 21:52.712
Wait, how the hell you know?

21:52.745 --> 21:54.714
Playing it on the news all morning.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.916
They had to blur out certain parts.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.851
Gidget, where's my motherfucking smoothie?

21:58.885 --> 22:00.486
Ma, give me a motherfucking minute.

22:01.054 --> 22:03.589
- How Deanna doing?
- What you want, Mercedes?

22:03.623 --> 22:05.091
I ain't gonna make it through the weekend.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.627
These folks done hemmed me up
in a cage with Patrice.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.961
I'ma need you to bail me out.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.697
- With what?
- A shovel.

22:10.730 --> 22:11.831
What the fuck you think?

22:11.864 --> 22:13.700
Well, ain't you been the one
stacking your paper.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.635
Should be able to bail your own self out.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.036
She took it all, Gidget.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.874
All the money I had stashed up
in the church building fund...

22:22.575 --> 22:25.745
...she used it for her own fucking church.

22:26.579 --> 22:27.747
And the killing part about it,

22:28.881 --> 22:31.417
...she took the space
that was gon' be mine.

22:31.451 --> 22:34.053
- This collect call from the...
- Chucalissa jail facility...

22:34.087 --> 22:37.623
Will disconnect in 15 seconds.

22:38.925 --> 22:41.427
- How much you need?
- Processing said 2K.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.629
- Shit, 'Cedes.
- Can you get it, Gidge?

22:43.663 --> 22:45.031
That's gon' be like
getting blood from a turnip.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.666
I'll take whatever, even a turnip.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.701
Five seconds.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.503
Well, let me see what I can do.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.438
Gidget, girl, I...

22:55.675 --> 22:56.776
...love you.

23:28.841 --> 23:29.976
Here.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.112
No, I'm good.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.481
Take it.

23:36.682 --> 23:38.151
That cage is cold.

23:42.522 --> 23:46.793
Mississippi don't need no nother church.
It need another gun range.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.195
See, if it had been one round
the corner from my house,

23:49.428 --> 23:51.931
I wouldn't have shot
my husband in his ass.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.734
But see, there, that's what he get.

23:54.767 --> 23:58.204
And next time, it won't be no BB gun,

23:58.437 --> 24:02.074
'cause it's illegal to shoot a BB gun
in the city limits of Chucalissa.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.610
And shoot heroin, too, apparently.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.712
Jesse done gave her a gift.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.714
Must be nice to have a booty like that.

24:09.148 --> 24:12.018
No, it bring burdens too.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.199
You really is trying it.

24:26.232 --> 24:29.235
There come a time when you must humble
yourself before the eyes of the Lord,

24:29.468 --> 24:33.172
unload your trespasses and forgive...

24:34.040 --> 24:35.975
...those who trespass against you.

24:36.008 --> 24:39.045
Bitch, do you know how far
your little stunt done set me behind?

24:39.078 --> 24:42.815
If you invest in the Lord, blessings
will rain down upon you, Mercedes.

24:43.850 --> 24:47.186
Well, while I was investin',
you was busy finessin'.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.722
You probably been planning to take my shit

24:49.755 --> 24:52.091
ever since you first started
holding it for me.

24:52.124 --> 24:53.626
Oh, Mercedes,

24:53.659 --> 24:56.529
you know, when God send
His finger down from Heaven

24:56.562 --> 24:59.899
to tap you on the shoulder
and say, "You it"...

25:00.867 --> 25:03.903
...twice I done felt the slap
of a angel wing 'cross my face,

25:03.936 --> 25:07.740
and twice I done had to pull
a feather out my own eye.

25:07.773 --> 25:09.141
Just what the hell you yapping 'bout?

25:09.175 --> 25:11.811
I been called, Mercedes,

25:11.844 --> 25:15.815
called to do what them niggas
over at Delta Valley Missionary Baptist

25:15.848 --> 25:17.884
won't let me do...

25:17.917 --> 25:19.018
preach.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.754
And what about what I been called to do?

25:21.787 --> 25:24.557
Unless you teaching these little heifers
how to twerk for Jesus,

25:24.590 --> 25:26.025
I don't see the purpose.

25:26.058 --> 25:30.029
What if I told you it was the only way
I could get Terricka back?

25:30.062 --> 25:31.764
What would you say then?

25:34.634 --> 25:37.169
You need to leave Terricka

25:37.203 --> 25:40.907
right where she at, with 'Chelle.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.209
The judge say I got a better chance
of getting custody

25:43.242 --> 25:45.711
if I can prove I got a steady job,
that I'm a fit mother.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.314
And you think that judge
gon' snatch Terricka

25:48.547 --> 25:50.182
up out that big, pretty house
and let her come live

25:50.216 --> 25:52.184
with you on the corner of Thugs and Thots?

25:52.218 --> 25:53.319
I thinks not.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.188
Terricka's my daughter.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.257
No, baby, she 'Chelle's.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.862
Bless a woman twofold
who took on the responsibility

26:02.895 --> 26:06.232
of raising another woman's child.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.134
Must have been hard lookin' in the face

26:08.167 --> 26:11.270
of that man's infidelity every day.

26:12.138 --> 26:16.008
But that's what make a woman godly.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.979
She know how to forgive.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.015
You could learn something from her.

26:23.950 --> 26:27.053
'Chelle's not her mama.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.154
I am.

26:30.189 --> 26:33.259
Are you really ready
for that responsibility,

26:33.292 --> 26:35.294
the sacrifice?

26:37.663 --> 26:42.168
Well, if given the chance
to raise my daughter myself...

26:43.202 --> 26:46.339
...I'd never be a mama like you.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.222
Gidge, look.

27:37.056 --> 27:41.027
My views done went up, like, 272,683.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.361
Let me see that shit.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.764
I just cannot believe...

27:44.797 --> 27:46.365
Your vajayjay done went viral, girl.

27:46.399 --> 27:48.701
This ain't porn, Jupiter.
It's, like, clatchy.

27:48.734 --> 27:50.002
Look, y'all should have stayed at home

27:50.036 --> 27:51.737
if you wanted to go on a date
with your fuckin' phones.

27:51.771 --> 27:52.772
Us stay at home?

27:52.805 --> 27:55.074
And where else you gon' find 2K
for the bill?

27:58.978 --> 28:00.212
Who the hell invited her?

28:00.246 --> 28:02.281
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

28:02.314 --> 28:05.251
Got the lowdown on Miss Mercedes Woodbine.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.853
First thing there's gonna be the 2K.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.388
Yep, we got that. Pony up, bitches.

28:09.422 --> 28:11.957
Hold your horses, now.
That's just the base.

28:11.991 --> 28:14.193
Now, there are
some outstanding parking tickets

28:14.226 --> 28:16.695
for Mercedes Woodbine in our system.

28:16.729 --> 28:19.331
That on top of several moving violations

28:19.365 --> 28:22.301
that have rolled
into several pending warrants,

28:22.334 --> 28:24.904
top that off with the new processing fees,

28:24.937 --> 28:27.006
the excise tax on top of that,

28:27.039 --> 28:28.874
the total total totals

28:28.908 --> 28:33.412
$5,358.34

28:33.446 --> 28:34.713
Oh, hell no.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.115
This must be some sort of mistake.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.050
Mercedes said they told her it was 2K.

28:38.084 --> 28:41.420
That must have been before processing,
but now that's what's in the system.

28:41.454 --> 28:44.223
- You sure?
- I'm as sure as sure can be.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.492
Sure as them legs is pretty.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.794
Look, we're just trying to get
our girlfriend out of jail.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.930
Well, I'm trying to get her out, too.

28:50.963 --> 28:54.400
Wonder if she is as fine as all y'all.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.869
- Hey, y'all, let's go.
- It's fucking men like you

28:56.902 --> 28:58.471
that make hell so full.

28:58.504 --> 29:00.406
I'm just trying to give
you bitches a compliment.

29:00.439 --> 29:01.941
- What, bitch?
- We don't need nothing from you!

29:01.974 --> 29:04.477
I know you need to get
out of my motherfucking office

29:04.510 --> 29:07.313
if you ain't got the money
to pay the fucking bail.

29:07.346 --> 29:10.049
Seem like the only way you heifers
are gon' get her out

29:10.082 --> 29:13.018
is if you put your house down
as collateral

29:13.052 --> 29:16.122
or your pussy.

29:16.155 --> 29:17.156
Pussy?

29:19.859 --> 29:22.528
- You know what?
- Fuck you!

29:22.761 --> 29:24.163
Bitch. Bitch.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.000
So now what we gonna do?

29:28.033 --> 29:29.835
We ain't got it!

29:29.869 --> 29:31.403
Man, it about to be
the first of the month.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.038
We got bills on top of bills.

29:33.072 --> 29:35.007
And with The Pynk 'bout to close,

29:35.040 --> 29:38.043
I don't think not na'an one of us
got nothing extra to spare.

29:38.077 --> 29:39.445
- What you said.
- Right?

29:39.478 --> 29:41.413
- Well, y'all...
- No.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.282
- Guys...
- No.

29:43.315 --> 29:46.552
Well, Mercedes would never do that to you.

29:47.786 --> 29:48.954
To any of us.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.991
Maybe, maybe not,

29:52.024 --> 29:55.895
but that tab she got
with Chucalissa on her, not us.

29:57.163 --> 29:58.364
Come on, Valerie.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.468
Bye, y'all.

30:05.538 --> 30:07.006
They right.

30:07.039 --> 30:08.974
I'm sorry, Gidge.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.209
We tried.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.580
Wait up, y'all!

30:35.568 --> 30:37.403
Would she really have done it for them?

30:39.271 --> 30:40.406
Hell, no.

30:47.046 --> 30:49.448
Her mama took all her stacks.

30:50.883 --> 30:53.419
What would you do if somebody
took all your money?

30:55.888 --> 30:56.922
Kill 'em.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.436
God's a bitch.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.106
And She got jokes tonight.

31:17.243 --> 31:20.446
He said, "I'll make you a fisher of men."

31:22.147 --> 31:24.883
This girl up here trying
to move on with her life

31:24.917 --> 31:26.986
and do right by her child,

31:27.019 --> 31:29.021
and you up here messing her up.

31:29.054 --> 31:32.124
Yeah, I mean, is you
any damn good at preachin'?

31:32.157 --> 31:35.527
Nah, she just a pimp
tryin' to be a pastor.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.230
- Oh, damn.
- Child.

31:42.301 --> 31:44.136
My daughter's right, though.

31:45.371 --> 31:48.674
Wouldn't know it to look at me
now and figure that

31:48.907 --> 31:50.309
that's where I started...

31:51.610 --> 31:53.279
...where I began...

31:54.480 --> 31:56.148
...in the muck...

31:57.149 --> 31:59.051
...in the valley,

31:59.084 --> 32:02.154
but won't God do it?

32:03.122 --> 32:06.625
I tell you, gals, you can rise

32:06.659 --> 32:08.627
up out of it.

32:08.661 --> 32:10.696
Yes, you can.

32:10.929 --> 32:15.467
We're just lilies

32:15.501 --> 32:17.636
In the valley

32:17.670 --> 32:22.408
Bright as the mornin' star

32:24.376 --> 32:25.311
What?

32:25.344 --> 32:28.347
Oh, lily

32:28.380 --> 32:30.349
In the valley

32:30.382 --> 32:34.219

32:34.253 --> 32:38.190
Oh, lily

32:38.223 --> 32:41.226

32:48.000 --> 32:50.369

32:50.402 --> 32:53.172

32:53.205 --> 32:56.508
Oh, we're just lilies

32:56.542 --> 32:59.011
- In the valley
- Oh, yeah.

32:59.044 --> 33:01.680
Bright as the mornin' star

33:01.714 --> 33:04.616
Oh, lily

33:04.650 --> 33:07.319
In the valley

33:07.353 --> 33:09.655
Bright as the mornin' star

33:09.688 --> 33:13.192
Oh, lily

33:13.225 --> 33:15.661
In the valley

33:15.694 --> 33:19.064
Bright as the mornin' star

33:19.098 --> 33:23.736
- Amen, amen
- Hey, hey, hey

33:23.769 --> 33:27.072
Amen

33:27.106 --> 33:29.241
Who ready to be saved tonight?

33:31.143 --> 33:34.012
When you been filled with the Holy Spirit,

33:34.046 --> 33:38.217
it feel like the best orgasm in the world,

33:38.250 --> 33:43.188
joy like no man or vibrator can give.

33:43.222 --> 33:44.089
All right.

33:44.123 --> 33:46.258
You talk about how I was a pimp,

33:46.291 --> 33:48.193
but I started lower than that,

33:48.227 --> 33:51.163
on my knees.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.164
Oh, yeah.

33:52.197 --> 33:56.034
And God knows
I weren't down there to pray.

33:56.068 --> 34:00.706
I got on my knees so you wouldn't have to.

34:00.739 --> 34:03.742
So don't think you gon'
sit up there and judge me.

34:03.776 --> 34:05.444
Amen!

34:05.477 --> 34:09.081
I've been made to feel so low,
lookin' up...

34:09.114 --> 34:10.549
it feel like lookin' down.

34:10.582 --> 34:13.352
- Oh, yeah!
- But God ain't judge me.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.255
He forgives.

34:16.288 --> 34:19.091
- He forgives us all!
- Hallelujah!

34:19.124 --> 34:22.728
What done brought you to the valley today?

34:22.761 --> 34:25.130
What you in here for?

34:25.164 --> 34:27.433
You ain't 'posed to ask somebody in jail
what they in there for.

34:27.466 --> 34:31.103
Child, this ain't jail.
This God's house now!

34:31.136 --> 34:33.405
What about you? What you in here for?

34:33.439 --> 34:36.675
I had an ounce of weed on me,
and I had to put it in my baby's diaper.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.779
- And you?
- I slit somebody neck.

34:43.148 --> 34:44.383
I got a DUI.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.718
- Oh, that ain't so bad.
- After I cheated on my husband

34:46.752 --> 34:49.188
with his...

34:49.221 --> 34:50.389
with his mama.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.790
What the fuck?

34:51.824 --> 34:53.525
"Judge not, ye shall not be judged."

34:53.559 --> 34:56.328
- Forgive me, Lord.
- Although she need to be judged.

34:57.496 --> 35:01.233
All sins can be forgiven,
all scars healed,

35:01.266 --> 35:04.670
all bridges mended, every soul saved

35:04.703 --> 35:09.675
'cause my God is a God of second chances.

35:10.676 --> 35:11.810
See, there, 'Cedes?

35:11.844 --> 35:14.146
This is God's plan.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.815
You have to let Him use you.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.184
Bow to His will.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.321
Join hands with me

35:22.354 --> 35:26.358
at the Breath of Life Full
Gospel Baptist Tabernacle.

35:27.226 --> 35:30.863
Come, my daughters. Forgive me.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.264
Forgive me, Lord.

35:32.297 --> 35:34.700
No. No.

35:36.368 --> 35:38.337
Forgive me.

35:53.552 --> 35:54.753
Forgive me.

36:17.676 --> 36:18.744
Mama...

36:20.612 --> 36:22.581
...you dead to me.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.818
Mercedes Woodbine.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.587
You made bail.

37:41.760 --> 37:42.861
Where Gidget?

37:43.662 --> 37:44.663
Keyshawn?

37:45.497 --> 37:46.698
Get in.

38:39.384 --> 38:40.385
Where to?

38:42.554 --> 38:43.889
Anywhere but here.

38:50.562 --> 38:53.532
He said, "Y'all, if you want to survive,
you got to go..."

38:53.565 --> 38:55.500
He says, "Well, I'ma go..."

38:55.534 --> 38:56.668
He said, "You gonna go...?"

38:56.702 --> 38:57.703
He said, "I don't know about it."

38:57.736 --> 39:00.706
So the big silverback jumped up
and said...

39:00.739 --> 39:02.574
And Bill said, "Okay."

39:04.409 --> 39:07.512
Boy, white folks tell
some strange stories, man.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.014
Jonah, now, you know what you got to do.

39:09.047 --> 39:11.917
Look, all right, give my godson
the Chucalissa chop, all right?

39:11.950 --> 39:16.888
That line gotta be so tight, now,
for this Cotton Harvest Ball tonight.

39:16.922 --> 39:18.523
Let's take this picture now.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.728
- Chucalissa chop.
- That's right.

39:22.761 --> 39:25.397
And I'm taking all my nephews
and nieces down there next week

39:25.430 --> 39:27.032
to the new Tydell Ruffin Park.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.800
You better, 'cause I'm gonna
have a bounce house down there

39:28.834 --> 39:31.002
and everything to celebrate.

39:31.036 --> 39:35.373
Look, I done told y'all
I was gon' turn this city around

39:35.407 --> 39:37.743
as soon as I got elected.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.411
Keep my promises.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.918
Shouldn't you be at the beauty shop?

39:47.552 --> 39:48.453
No.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.790
I'm right where I needs to be...

39:52.891 --> 39:54.960
...'cause it's about to be
a chop right here.

40:01.767 --> 40:03.668
Now, Mayor Ruffin,
you know I loves to decorate

40:03.702 --> 40:05.971
my fine establishment in the color pink.

40:08.106 --> 40:11.643
But this notice right here
about to find itself wiping my ass.

40:12.711 --> 40:14.980
Ain't my fault you can't run no business.

40:15.013 --> 40:18.850
Forcin' deserving folk off they property
is not a way to run a city.

40:18.884 --> 40:21.653
Your establishment
is a blight on this town.

40:21.686 --> 40:23.121
A community blight?

40:23.155 --> 40:24.990
That's why you forced a foreclosure?

40:25.991 --> 40:27.692
I been a help to this city.

40:29.895 --> 40:30.796
No.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.798
Chucalissa is gon' be
walking into a new day,

40:32.831 --> 40:35.934
and some places just gots
to join hands with history.

40:35.967 --> 40:37.435
You trying to erase folk.

40:37.469 --> 40:40.872
Well, look, some niggas need to be erased.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.512
You know, I wonder if...

40:48.146 --> 40:50.482
...Jonah, Jonah Jenkins

40:50.515 --> 40:53.919
like to know that the Promised Land Equities'
is offering his barbershop

40:53.952 --> 40:56.121
half of what they offering
them white folks

40:56.154 --> 40:58.523
for they barbershop over on Kalb Avenue.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.693
And how you privy to that?

41:05.897 --> 41:08.133
Land appraisal chart right here.

41:09.634 --> 41:11.102
Perhaps.

41:14.706 --> 41:17.742
If you think that any of us gon' care

41:17.776 --> 41:20.846
about what this he-she-it freak show
got to say,

41:20.879 --> 41:22.480
don't fool yourself.

41:22.514 --> 41:26.852
Auction is only two weeks away,
and your ass gon' be on the block.

41:29.154 --> 41:33.158
Are you gon' buy it,
or is it gon' be Andre?

41:34.626 --> 41:36.895
'Cause I heard he don't never pay for it.

41:37.896 --> 41:39.497
Ain't that right, Andre?

41:40.599 --> 41:44.502
You are a tumor in this town,

41:44.536 --> 41:47.572
and I am just counting
the motherfucking minutes

41:47.606 --> 41:50.942
till I can cut you the fuck out.

41:51.910 --> 41:55.747
Now, you can tell Eloise
the rest of your complaint,

41:55.780 --> 41:59.084
and I'll make sure
the mayor's office get right on it.

42:09.628 --> 42:10.929
I bet it will.

42:22.941 --> 42:26.778
How in the hell did that thing

42:26.811 --> 42:29.748
get a confidential land appraisal chart?

42:33.785 --> 42:35.887
Is you fuckin' Uncle Clifford?

42:35.921 --> 42:37.622
No!

42:37.656 --> 42:42.327
Well, somebody done slid up
in more than just your DMs to get this.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.696
Somebody must have slid up on your dick.

42:44.729 --> 42:46.164
- I ain't fuck anybody.
- Well, look, you know what?

42:46.197 --> 42:50.035
Whatever you done is you
and your wife's business.

42:50.068 --> 42:51.937
I just want to know
how you gon' let something

42:51.970 --> 42:53.271
like this out of your sight, boy?

42:53.305 --> 42:57.175
I think I may have
left it somewhere in The Pynk.

42:57.208 --> 42:59.678
Look, now, I done been
in a whole lot of hole-in-the-walls,

42:59.711 --> 43:01.746
but I ain't never lost
no paperwork up in no coochie.

43:01.780 --> 43:04.316
The only reason I was even in that place,

43:04.349 --> 43:06.618
that's where people here
want to do business.

43:06.651 --> 43:10.622
- Corbin K--.
- Spare me the motherfucking bullshit.

43:10.655 --> 43:14.292
Now, Uncle Clifford done fucked you
and probably fucked the whole deal.

43:18.063 --> 43:19.264
- Mayor Ruffin?
- Unh?

43:19.297 --> 43:20.899
We've arrived.

43:20.932 --> 43:23.969
Now, you close that Kyle farm deal.

43:24.002 --> 43:28.073
And I got to go up in here
in this fucking Cotton Harvest Ball

43:28.106 --> 43:30.842
kiki with these motherfucking crackers

43:30.875 --> 43:33.144
to get this fucking casino done.

43:33.178 --> 43:34.980
Me and you don't do the do,

43:35.013 --> 43:36.881
this casino deal ain't gonna happen.

43:36.915 --> 43:39.684
Now, you finish it before I do.

43:40.719 --> 43:41.820
Nigga.

43:45.390 --> 43:47.826
Hey, now, all right.

43:47.859 --> 43:49.327
Let's get on in here, now.

44:17.722 --> 44:20.225
I see you, Miss Mississippi.

44:53.992 --> 44:56.861
Y'all give it up for our girl
Miss Mississippi, man.

44:58.997 --> 45:00.865
She gone be the next Black Chyna, y'all.

45:05.470 --> 45:07.405
You mean you can't move
some more money round?

45:07.439 --> 45:10.975
I've been robbing Peter to pay Paul, man,
but these books are a mess.

45:11.009 --> 45:11.910
Shit.

45:11.943 --> 45:15.713
Well, you best rob Peter to pay Pamiesha,
'cause we ain't gonna go down...

45:22.053 --> 45:24.422
Now, how little nigga know
how to get back here?

45:26.791 --> 45:29.961
- Ain't it about time for your break?
- I ain't had a break since 1999.

45:29.994 --> 45:31.229
Nigga!

45:51.816 --> 45:53.151
Can I help you with something?

45:54.119 --> 45:55.487
I got another complaint.

45:55.520 --> 45:58.790
Well, the complaint box is by the exit,

45:58.823 --> 46:02.060
but since you back here, I guess
I can make a note for management.

46:02.861 --> 46:04.462
So that's how it's gon' be, huh?

46:05.763 --> 46:07.499
Just gon' act like
nothing happened last night?

46:07.532 --> 46:11.302
Look, I just got kind of carried away.

46:11.336 --> 46:12.437
I saw.

46:14.205 --> 46:15.340
So did I.

46:16.474 --> 46:17.809
I wanted to do it again,

46:17.842 --> 46:19.844
but when I woke up on that couch,
you was gone.

46:21.012 --> 46:23.248
I got too much on my plate
for any kind of...

46:23.281 --> 46:24.415
I heard.

46:24.449 --> 46:26.518
You know, word on the street's
y'all is closing.

46:26.551 --> 46:27.485
Yeah.

46:29.053 --> 46:31.055
I got to find a way to plug up this boat.

46:31.089 --> 46:33.024
Cliff, my nigga, you look pressed?

46:33.858 --> 46:36.928
Need to let somebody take you on up
out this office for a minute.

46:36.961 --> 46:41.533
You know, maybe take you somewhere.

46:41.566 --> 46:45.403
Child, now, you know good and goddamn well

46:45.436 --> 46:48.173
that me and you ain't meant
for the outside.

46:48.206 --> 46:51.209
So that's how it's always gon' be?
We just gon' suck and fuck in the dark?

46:55.346 --> 46:56.915
Where you want to take me to,
Lil Murda?

46:56.948 --> 46:58.082
LaMarques.

46:59.984 --> 47:01.219
Okay.

47:02.387 --> 47:03.922
LaMarques.

47:06.391 --> 47:07.592
Where we going?

47:08.359 --> 47:10.195
Do you want to go
on a romantic walk down by the river?

47:10.228 --> 47:11.196
If that's what you want.

47:11.229 --> 47:14.465
Okay, well, the last two faggots did that
found theyselves floating up in it.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.368
You want to take me over
to the Hot Wing Castle

47:17.402 --> 47:19.070
for that lemon pepper wet?

47:20.038 --> 47:22.106
The last two dykes did that
found their booty holes

47:22.140 --> 47:23.875
turnt out by a train of truckers.

47:23.908 --> 47:25.543
- That ain't gon...
- LaMarques...

47:26.411 --> 47:27.545
...where...

47:28.546 --> 47:30.548
...you gonna take me?

47:34.085 --> 47:36.087
I advise you to take me nowhere.

47:40.992 --> 47:42.860
Just tell me where you want to go.

47:42.894 --> 47:44.195
I don't do dates.

47:44.229 --> 47:46.130
There's a first time for everything.

47:49.167 --> 47:51.569
Hey, they playing your song again, okay.

47:53.104 --> 47:54.339
Yours.

48:08.286 --> 48:09.587
Oh, my goodness.

48:10.455 --> 48:13.458
This dude all up in my DM
asking if my coochie is shaved.

48:13.491 --> 48:17.362
I'm like, "Nigga, where they do that at?"

48:17.395 --> 48:21.466
I'm a grown woman, and I stay
with a little landing strip.

48:22.267 --> 48:24.569
My, my, how things change.

48:24.602 --> 48:26.271
Did you say something, Toy?

48:26.971 --> 48:29.574
I was just remarking
on your glow-up, Keyshawn.

48:29.607 --> 48:30.642
Look good on you.

48:31.476 --> 48:33.177
Thanks.

48:33.211 --> 48:35.146
I get, like, 50 likes a minute.

48:35.179 --> 48:37.081
This joker gone more than viral.

48:37.115 --> 48:39.317
I bet aliens even looking at it.

48:40.918 --> 48:45.189
Keyshawn, Diamond said
Derrick out there with the baby.

48:55.366 --> 48:58.002
Derrick done seen that video yet?

48:58.036 --> 49:01.039
If the aliens done seen it,
I'm sure he's seen it.

49:25.296 --> 49:26.364
Keyshawn.

49:28.666 --> 49:30.535
Why you coming out looking all naked?

49:30.568 --> 49:33.004
I was running out here
real quick to get Regal.

49:36.641 --> 49:40.111
You know, now that I'm back at the shop,

49:40.144 --> 49:42.180
you don't have to work here no more.

49:43.348 --> 49:46.651
I mean, you could stay at home.

49:46.684 --> 49:50.188
- I don't want to stay at home, Derrick.
- Fuck, Keyshawn.

49:53.524 --> 49:55.326
Why won't you just let me
take care of you?

49:55.360 --> 49:58.229
Pays the bills, Derrick, that's it.

50:07.071 --> 50:08.473
You sure that's it?

50:08.506 --> 50:09.574
That's it.

50:10.675 --> 50:13.010
I see why you blowing up, though.

50:14.412 --> 50:15.747
The video.

50:21.185 --> 50:22.253
You...

50:23.488 --> 50:25.690
You look beautiful.

50:32.263 --> 50:34.432
Who watch Regal when you dance?

50:37.535 --> 50:39.437
Everybody do.

51:13.471 --> 51:15.106
Oh, fuck.

51:22.079 --> 51:24.115
Okay, it's okay.
Hey, hey, I'ma go talk to her.

51:24.148 --> 51:25.650
- I'll go to talk to her.
- Let me handle her.

51:34.792 --> 51:36.160
Okay.

51:52.143 --> 51:54.445
What you getting drunk off of now?

51:54.479 --> 51:56.147
Your favorite...

51:56.814 --> 51:57.849
...Kool-Aid.

51:57.882 --> 52:00.284
Bitch, this just purdee sugar.

52:00.318 --> 52:02.220
Better sugar than alcohol.

52:02.253 --> 52:03.621
Cold turkey, huh?

52:04.622 --> 52:06.357
Same way you stop stripping.

52:06.858 --> 52:10.194
One day, you wake up, and it's time.

52:10.695 --> 52:12.196
I ain't going back.

52:21.772 --> 52:25.376
Once upon a time, I ran out of a door,
and I never looked back.

52:27.745 --> 52:30.214
Thought I had the ultimate plan.

52:31.849 --> 52:33.751
But I took a wrong turn.

52:37.722 --> 52:39.557
And the waters overtook me.

52:49.267 --> 52:50.535
I tried to grab her.

52:55.239 --> 52:57.208
But God had other plans.

53:02.213 --> 53:03.581
I searched for her...

53:04.515 --> 53:06.250
...for three days...

53:07.585 --> 53:09.420
...and three nights.

53:12.223 --> 53:14.392
I wanted to die, Mercedes.

53:15.893 --> 53:17.895
I deserved to die.

53:23.668 --> 53:25.269
But then this...

53:26.270 --> 53:27.605
...suitcase...

53:28.606 --> 53:30.641
...came riding in.

53:35.246 --> 53:38.416
And inside it was a new life.

53:41.452 --> 53:44.422
Life is just a long day's journey
into tomorrow.

53:46.624 --> 53:48.926
You just got to make it
through the long, dark nights.

53:49.961 --> 53:52.229
They say God is a God of second chances.

53:53.631 --> 53:55.466
I'm gon' pay you back that bail money.

53:57.969 --> 53:59.470
You don't need to pay me back...

54:01.272 --> 54:03.474
...'cause I got more where that came from.

54:16.320 --> 54:19.523
Bitch, why the fuck you stripping,
you got all this scrilla?

54:19.557 --> 54:20.825
'Cause I like it.

54:22.326 --> 54:24.962
I can run you ten stacks
by the end of the week.

54:24.996 --> 54:26.330
Ten stacks?

54:28.466 --> 54:30.635
Okay, and then I'm out,

54:30.668 --> 54:34.271
'cause I know better enough than to deal
with finessin' ass hoes for long.

54:34.305 --> 54:35.339
It ain't a scam.

54:36.407 --> 54:37.508
It's...

54:38.676 --> 54:39.977
...retribution.

54:45.683 --> 54:46.851
Okay.

54:48.486 --> 54:49.887
What I got to do?

54:56.360 --> 54:57.361
Bitch...

54:58.863 --> 55:00.831
You bets put down
my stripper name.

55:00.865 --> 55:03.300
What? Mercedes ain't your stripper name?

55:03.334 --> 55:05.903
Like Uncle Clifford say,
what's the last thing you ate

55:05.936 --> 55:07.972
and the color of your underwear?

55:10.541 --> 55:12.009
We gon' need IDs.

55:12.043 --> 55:13.611
I know this man named Mane
that can hook us up.

55:13.644 --> 55:15.613
- You trust him?
- He ain't no snitch.

55:15.646 --> 55:17.848
Why you think he steady stay in jail?

55:17.882 --> 55:19.717
How many you need?

55:19.750 --> 55:20.985
Ten.

55:21.018 --> 55:22.019
Okay.

55:23.354 --> 55:25.022
Crystal S. Flowers?

55:25.056 --> 55:26.757
So you ate a crystal?

55:27.625 --> 55:30.061
Bitch, don't tell me you been
in Chucalissa

55:30.094 --> 55:31.629
and you ain't been to Krystal's yet?
