00:26.719 --> 00:31.960
Hi, there ! Could we have a chat
about a nice guy named Odin ?

00:32.039 --> 00:35.359
- What time is it ?
- I have no idea. I live watchlessly.

00:35.439 --> 00:38.359
Listen, I know what you're thinking.

00:38.439 --> 00:42.520
What could this one-eyed,
mead-drinking god have to offer ?

00:42.600 --> 00:46.840
- The answer is: Quite a lot.
- Sorry, I'm not interested.

00:46.920 --> 00:50.000
It will only be a quick chat.

00:51.600 --> 00:55.399
No ! I said no !

00:55.479 --> 00:58.719
- A quick chat ?
- No !

00:58.799 --> 01:04.200
I live here, and I decide
who gets to come in ! Got it ?

01:04.280 --> 01:06.159
Okay...

01:06.239 --> 01:10.519
- Say hello to Enginnsdottir.
- What ?

01:12.120 --> 01:16.040
How do you know who I work with ?

01:16.120 --> 01:18.239
- Everything okay with yourself ?
- Yeah.

01:18.319 --> 01:21.680
Just an annoying Ásatrú-guy.

01:21.760 --> 01:27.200
Those people have no shame.
He eventually got the picture, though.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.560
Okay, see you.

02:58.199 --> 03:04.159
Digital networks are down worldwide
after a group of Neo-Luddites

03:04.240 --> 03:10.120
sabotaged the synchronization
of digital clocks around the world.

03:10.199 --> 03:13.120
Neo-Luddites are
an anti technology group

03:13.199 --> 03:17.560
with roots in the beforeigner community
from 19th century England.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.840
No...

03:23.360 --> 03:26.639
I think we'll have to
reboot the whole thing.

03:26.719 --> 03:30.400
You're having a cold pie for lunch,
I'm afraid.

03:30.479 --> 03:32.520
Damned luddites !

03:35.000 --> 03:40.360
This is Trine Syversen.
She worked at NATO for several years,

03:40.439 --> 03:44.000
before she changed
her identity to Ada.

03:44.080 --> 03:49.719
The girl was a promising gamer
and was recruited as a drone operator.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.560
She's worked on NATO bases
in Geilenkirchen and at Sigonella.

03:53.639 --> 03:59.240
At Sigonella she was in charge
of tactical missions in Libya.

03:59.319 --> 04:03.120
She was dismissed,
under unclear circumstances...

04:03.199 --> 04:08.840
I don't understand why you're sure
that this woman is linked to our cases.

04:08.919 --> 04:13.280
She's worked with
the drone that killed Navn.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.720
Her transtemporal identity
ties her to the Tjuvholmen case.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.439
We should look into it.
Do we know where she is ?

04:19.519 --> 04:22.920
No one at AFTT has
seen her since we were there.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.160
As we were trying to point out
before Wenche interrupted us,

04:27.240 --> 04:31.160
Ada was treated for PTSD
when she came home.

04:31.240 --> 04:33.959
We've contacted her psychologist.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.240
That sounds
like a good place to start.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.680
Hurry up, please. I'm leaving.

04:59.759 --> 05:02.560
Relax, I was just
getting some sweetener.

05:02.639 --> 05:06.360
Sorry to bother you,
but some of us have work to do.

05:06.439 --> 05:09.439
Oh my. I didn't know
farmwives were so feisty.

05:09.519 --> 05:11.759
What the hell does that mean ?

05:14.439 --> 05:18.360
I'm following your friend on B4, Urd.

05:18.439 --> 05:23.639
- You're lying about your background.
- Stay away from Urd !

05:23.720 --> 05:26.120
The last thing she needs
is your shit.

05:26.759 --> 05:29.120
Calm down, hothead.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.360
What the fuck ?!

06:34.199 --> 06:37.480
THOUGHT ABOUT MY OFFER, CHIEF ?

06:44.680 --> 06:46.560
Dad !

06:48.079 --> 06:52.360
- We're going to kindergarten.
- Yes, we're going there right now.

06:54.079 --> 06:56.439
Hi, we're from the newspaper.
Can we ask you some questions ?

06:56.519 --> 06:59.199
No, thanks,
I don't read newspapers.

06:59.279 --> 07:02.800
Can you confirm that you're
the man they call Tore Hund ?

07:02.879 --> 07:05.920
Move.
We're late for kindergarten.

07:13.680 --> 07:17.000
There must've been something wrong
with the transmission.

07:18.959 --> 07:21.800
Wenche's version
is completely different.

07:21.879 --> 07:26.199
Were there any indications
that this wasn't an accident ?

07:27.680 --> 07:30.040
No.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.600
What did the doctors say ?

07:43.040 --> 07:47.240
Thank God
I didn't suffer any permanent injury.

07:48.279 --> 07:54.519
You know what, Wenche ?
I think you should take a few days off.

07:54.600 --> 08:00.040
We'll evaluate this unfortunate event
when you're back.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.959
I'm not sure the Chief of Police
would agree with that approach.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.639
We don't have to involve her, do we ?

08:08.720 --> 08:13.800
I've emailed both her and the union.
She wants an investigation.

08:15.680 --> 08:16.839
Okay.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.959
- She's got quite the imagination.
- Please.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.560
I know you did it on purpose.

08:30.160 --> 08:33.919
She's been out to get me
ever since I started here.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.440
So Wenche made you step on the gas
pedal ? You weren't responsible ?

08:38.519 --> 08:43.720
- Whose side are you on ?
- Whoever rises above it.

08:43.799 --> 08:47.039
Maybe we can focus
on the investigation instead.

09:16.440 --> 09:22.080
The man who according to Snorri
Sturluson killed St Olaf in an ambush.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.000
Is this where you're hiding ?

09:30.519 --> 09:33.799
I think we should have
a chat in my office.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.639
Is it true that you're Tore Hund ?

09:48.720 --> 09:51.720
- Where did you hear that ?
- It's all over VGTV.

09:51.799 --> 09:56.519
- They say you killed St Olaf.
- Please, don't start.

09:56.600 --> 10:01.200
- I need to know who you are.
- You know that.

10:01.279 --> 10:04.440
- I'm Tommy.
- Not who you are in the present.

10:04.519 --> 10:07.639
Tell me the truth, are you Tore Hund ?

10:07.720 --> 10:09.320
I was Tore Hund.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.360
In that case, please hand over
your uniform and leave.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.399
What do you mean ?

10:20.480 --> 10:26.080
I'm sorry, but murdering saints
isn't compatible with Foodie's values.

10:37.480 --> 10:42.240
I didn't want it to end this way,
but I've got no choice.

10:44.440 --> 10:48.879
A commander always has a choice.

11:04.879 --> 11:07.840
Trine came to us three years ago.

11:07.919 --> 11:13.080
She had been a civilian for
a few months, and was rather down.

11:13.159 --> 11:17.080
Was she identifying
as Ada back then ?

11:17.159 --> 11:21.159
No, she became transtemporal
during her stay here.

11:22.639 --> 11:24.399
Could you elaborate ?

11:28.480 --> 11:31.200
She entered
into a romantic relationship

11:31.279 --> 11:34.840
with a patient from the 19th century
called The Doctorand.

11:36.519 --> 11:37.960
He was a scientist,

11:38.039 --> 11:43.200
but arriving in our time
made him hate everything modern.

11:43.279 --> 11:47.440
- Do you think he was a Neo-Luddite ?
- I wouldn't be surprised.

11:47.519 --> 11:49.919
And that was appealing to her ?

11:50.000 --> 11:53.240
Yes, that was when
she started calling herself Ada

11:53.320 --> 11:55.679
and wearing 19th century clothing.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.919
- Do you know where they are now ?
- No idea.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.159
But I think there are some audio tapes
from their group sessions.

12:04.240 --> 12:09.919
Maybe we should talk about your story ?
You're sceptical to all things modern.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.960
But you were a scientist
in your own time ?

12:13.039 --> 12:16.279
Back then I didn't know
what I know now.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.159
And what is that ?

12:18.240 --> 12:24.360
That science is a tumour that turns man
into a flaccid, narcissistic pet.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.519
A slave to his own machines.

12:27.639 --> 12:31.679
But science has also
made way for some amazing things ?

12:31.759 --> 12:37.440
What are you referring to ?
Hiroshima ? Or internet pornography ?

12:37.519 --> 12:42.080
It's given us explanations
to countless phenomena.

12:42.159 --> 12:48.720
I don't believe in explanations
anymore. Now I believe in us.

12:48.799 --> 12:51.480
In beforeigners.

12:51.559 --> 12:56.960
I believe God sent us here
to save modern man from perdition.

12:57.039 --> 13:01.519
The Doctorand is right. Let me
show you why. These are pictures...

13:01.600 --> 13:03.279
That must be her.

13:03.360 --> 13:07.039
...a hacker named Mariana
confronted me with at Geilenkirchen.

13:07.120 --> 13:12.519
They showed me what was on the
other end of my drone operations.

13:15.279 --> 13:21.240
You can't show military photos here.
Please put them away. Ada ?

13:29.440 --> 13:32.440
Saint murderer !

13:37.759 --> 13:42.320
This is your opponent.

13:42.399 --> 13:45.879
- What's the answer ?
- Jesus !

13:47.960 --> 13:49.559
What took you so long ?

13:49.919 --> 13:56.120
My job's important. I can't drop
everything because Tore's on the news.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.759
We wanted to see how you're doing.

14:26.840 --> 14:30.559
- Those people outside are crazy.
- Do you have money ?

14:30.639 --> 14:33.240
- We heard you lost your job.
- Yeah.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.879
I've got something else in the works.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.320
YOU IN ?

14:38.879 --> 14:40.879
I need a smoke.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.440
Murderers must be punished !

14:49.519 --> 14:55.480
- Where's your wife ?
- Jeanette took Maria to her parents.

14:55.559 --> 15:00.360
Women in this time usually abandon ship
if there's a ripple in the ocean.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.240
Jeanette isn't like that.

15:03.759 --> 15:08.000
If you dumped me for her,
I would've understood.

15:08.080 --> 15:11.120
But that woman from this time...

15:11.200 --> 15:14.039
Have you lost faith in love, or what ?

15:17.399 --> 15:21.120
You and I loved each other
when life was simple.

15:21.200 --> 15:25.159
You were young and beautiful,
and I was a big shot.

15:26.480 --> 15:31.080
Jeanette and I found each other
in a dark hole.

15:31.440 --> 15:35.360
Our love was the light
that showed us the way out.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.559
Bullshit !

15:44.919 --> 15:46.840
Do you hate me too ?

15:50.759 --> 15:55.039
No. I realized quickly
that we wouldn't last in this time.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.639
I remember my dad saying:

15:59.720 --> 16:04.000
"What the girl lacks in ancestry,
she makes up for in wisdom."

16:05.840 --> 16:08.320
Big Tore was a good man.

16:16.879 --> 16:19.480
Saint murderer !

16:19.559 --> 16:24.840
Saint murderer ! Saint murderer !

16:33.919 --> 16:40.440
- Hi. Is Ingrid ready ?
- She won't be coming.

16:40.519 --> 16:43.000
But it's my weekend.

16:44.759 --> 16:51.159
One of the girls just told Marie where
they got the eye drops from.

16:51.240 --> 16:55.679
Is it correct that you are suffering
from temproxate abuse ?

16:55.759 --> 17:01.440
My issues at work have
nothing to do with Ingrid.

17:01.519 --> 17:04.319
It has everything to do with Ingrid.

17:04.400 --> 17:09.400
How could you expose such innocence
to this, pardon the expression, filth ?

17:12.680 --> 17:17.240
You think the world
is black and white, but it's not.

17:17.319 --> 17:19.680
If the girls hadn't stolen
the drug from me,

17:19.759 --> 17:21.599
they'd have found it elsewhere.

17:21.680 --> 17:27.759
My assessment from earlier stands.
I have indeed misjudged you.

17:27.839 --> 17:32.519
Yet I was also mistaken.
You are a lesser man than I thought.

17:32.599 --> 17:38.519
Fine. And you're a charlatan,
using my family as a replacement

17:38.599 --> 17:41.440
because you can't handle
the loss of your son.

17:58.799 --> 18:05.079
My ability to share information about
the incident in Nordmarka is limited.

18:05.160 --> 18:10.480
But the death is being investigated in
connection with the Tjuvholmen murder.

18:10.559 --> 18:14.440
Aftenposten.
Do you think it's the same killer ?

18:14.519 --> 18:16.079
That's too early to say.

18:16.160 --> 18:21.119
Could the murderer be a serial killer
who attacks Prehistorians ?

18:21.200 --> 18:24.519
Well, that's not
the most likely theory.

18:24.599 --> 18:27.039
- But you're not ruling it out ?
- No.

18:27.119 --> 18:32.279
How can Prehistoric citizens
protect themselves against the killer ?

18:32.359 --> 18:34.319
Do you have a profile on the killer ?

18:34.400 --> 18:36.559
Will he attack present day people ?

18:36.640 --> 18:38.960
That's all we have for now.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.720
How can people protect themselves ?

18:44.799 --> 18:50.279
We interrupt this update from the
press conference at the police station.

18:50.359 --> 18:54.440
Let's hear from abroad:
There were riots between...

19:20.039 --> 19:23.279
Could we be dealing
with a serial killer ?

19:23.359 --> 19:25.200
No, that's nonsense.

19:25.279 --> 19:30.039
The murders are very different.
The first victim wasn't a Prehistorian.

19:30.119 --> 19:32.400
Give me the latest from your team.

19:32.480 --> 19:36.039
I need some information
for the minister.

19:36.119 --> 19:41.720
Yes. They're following a possible lead
to the Neo-Luddite community.

19:41.799 --> 19:46.079
- How did they figure that out ?
- I've not worked that out.

19:48.039 --> 19:50.480
Work it out, Harald.

19:50.559 --> 19:54.839
Both the investigation and internal
conflicts within your team.

20:09.640 --> 20:13.480
Did you find anything
in the bank statements ?

20:13.559 --> 20:17.920
Yes, I did.
There was one interesting transaction.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.519
A long-term lease
on a storage facility

20:21.599 --> 20:24.640
paid for with
Trine Syversen's credit card.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.400
That's what I found.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.480
Hi, we're from the police.

20:52.559 --> 20:55.119
- We spoke on the phone ?
- Yes.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.160
Right. Do you have the key ?

20:57.240 --> 21:02.720
The thing is, the tenant dropped by
just now and picked up the key.

21:02.799 --> 21:04.359
Now ?

21:27.000 --> 21:30.880
The storage room is to your right
at the end of the corridor.

22:14.599 --> 22:19.079
Zero one to Sierra two zero. All units
have received a picture of the suspect.

22:19.160 --> 22:23.279
So far, no observations.
Will keep you updated. Out.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.079
Shit !

22:36.319 --> 22:40.119
- What's that ?
- Isn't that your daughter's friend ?

22:55.799 --> 22:57.799
Please, come in.

22:57.880 --> 23:01.559
You can't stay long.
Axel doesn't know you're here.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.279
Why not ?

23:03.359 --> 23:08.319
He's paranoid after the way Madeleine
was treated at the reception centre.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.680
He won't let anyone else see her.

23:13.240 --> 23:14.960
Honey ?

23:15.680 --> 23:17.920
Honey, hey.

23:18.000 --> 23:23.079
Ingrid's dad and a colleague from
the police are here to talk to you.

23:25.359 --> 23:27.880
Hi, Madeleine.

23:27.960 --> 23:31.880
We have some questions about
the time you spent in quarantine.

23:31.960 --> 23:34.680
Did you meet a woman named Ada ?

23:39.400 --> 23:44.160
It's becoming increasingly difficult
to understand her these days.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.440
We found a file in Ada's belongings

23:46.519 --> 23:49.319
that might be from your stay
at the centre.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.880
How were you treated ?

23:56.279 --> 24:00.640
- This is my language.
- Is it making any sense ?

24:16.680 --> 24:18.640
Where are those numbers from ?

24:20.640 --> 24:22.599
They were written...

24:22.680 --> 24:24.599
On the wall...

24:24.680 --> 24:26.279
What wall ?

24:28.559 --> 24:33.559
We have to stop. Axel will be here
any minute. You need to leave.

24:44.119 --> 24:47.119
What do you think
is wrong with her ?

24:47.200 --> 24:50.759
It seems like she's been
possessed by an evil spirit.

24:50.839 --> 24:53.000
A "sjóvættir" or something like that.

24:56.599 --> 24:58.839
- Get here now.
- What ?

24:58.920 --> 25:01.599
Tore's wife called,
he might die tonight.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.640
What do you mean ?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.079
A fighter wants revenge
for Stiklestad.

25:06.160 --> 25:09.880
- Slow down.
- He's fighting a beast ! Just come !

25:09.960 --> 25:12.440
Fine, see you there.

25:12.519 --> 25:14.359
I have to sort out
some private stuff.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.200
Are you joking ?

25:16.279 --> 25:19.400
We have tons of stuff
we need to go through.

25:19.480 --> 25:21.759
I'll get back as soon as I can.

25:54.880 --> 25:59.559
- Where are you ?
- Sorry, this may take some time.

25:59.640 --> 26:04.319
- I don't think I'll be back tonight.
- What the hell ? Are you at a party ?

26:04.640 --> 26:07.519
Of course not. I have to go.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.519
Alfhildr ! Hello ?

26:42.799 --> 26:46.000
I thought I was done
with all that damn fighting.

26:46.079 --> 26:48.960
This is madness.
You have to call it off.

26:49.039 --> 26:51.319
No.
My family needs the money.

26:51.400 --> 26:57.319
- I told you I can lend you money.
- Thanks, but I reap my own salary.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.480
What are you doing here ?

28:55.480 --> 28:56.640
Hold her.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.759
How are you doing ?

29:33.559 --> 29:35.839
What are you doing here ?
Really ?

29:35.920 --> 29:38.599
- Don't be like that.
- It was you who left us.

29:38.680 --> 29:41.119
I thought you rose above such things.

29:41.200 --> 29:45.559
Even though I didn't want to be
one of your guru groupies,

29:45.640 --> 29:47.640
we're still fighting the same fight.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.960
Guru groupie ?

29:50.039 --> 29:53.279
You find it necessary to lapse
to such ignoble terminology

29:53.640 --> 29:55.119
about what we shared ?

29:58.119 --> 29:59.480
Please.

30:00.759 --> 30:02.640
I have nowhere else to go.

30:04.519 --> 30:08.519
My darkened soul
is capable of many things.

30:10.519 --> 30:14.920
To shun my little warrior
is not one of them.

30:20.640 --> 30:24.480
In 18 matches he has 12 KOs,
and is still undefeated.

30:24.920 --> 30:29.640
Please welcome
Tobias "The Savior" Hansen !

30:38.759 --> 30:42.599
The next contestant has no fights,
no victories.

30:42.680 --> 30:45.200
Tore Hund !

31:06.839 --> 31:10.319
You know the rules.
No groin kicks, no eye-gouging.

31:10.400 --> 31:13.559
A fair and respectful fight.
Shake hands !

31:47.920 --> 31:50.440
Kill, Tore ! Kill !

31:51.519 --> 31:53.839
Get him, Tore !

31:54.759 --> 31:56.559
Yes ! Yes !

32:03.240 --> 32:07.759
Tore ! Fight !
Fight like in Bjarmeland !

32:09.559 --> 32:11.720
Stand up, Tore !

32:18.680 --> 32:19.960
Fight !

34:44.880 --> 34:48.280
We have to discuss
a slightly unpleasant matter.

34:48.360 --> 34:53.199
The car you drove
was searched after the crash.

34:53.280 --> 34:56.079
We found this
in the glove compartment.

34:56.159 --> 34:57.440
What is that ?

34:57.519 --> 35:02.400
Don't act naive, Alfhildr.
We've checked your arrival papers.

35:02.480 --> 35:05.519
We know you've been
treated with temproxate.

35:07.719 --> 35:11.800
Do you know how this
ended up in your patrol car ?

35:28.239 --> 35:32.639
I guess the results were
in your favour ?

35:32.719 --> 35:35.880
Are you kidding ?
They found temproxate in the car.

35:35.960 --> 35:40.079
She claims to know nothing,
so they'll do some tests.

35:40.159 --> 35:43.360
Poor thing. She doesn't realize
when the game is over.

35:55.639 --> 35:59.039
I hear you suspect Alfhildr
of abusing temproxate ?

35:59.119 --> 36:00.400
Yes.

36:03.239 --> 36:08.239
If you have relevant information,
this is the time to share it.

36:11.480 --> 36:13.719
The bottle you found wasn't hers.

36:15.280 --> 36:19.639
- She's covering for a colleague.
- Which colleague ?

36:42.719 --> 36:46.119
- Where the hell were you ?
- I overslept.

36:47.480 --> 36:52.320
You're my only friend here,
and you can't even set an alarm for me.

36:52.400 --> 36:55.039
I let them take my blood
just to cover for you.

36:55.119 --> 37:00.599
Well, you didn't need to.
I told them the temproxate was mine.

37:03.880 --> 37:05.280
Why ?

37:06.559 --> 37:08.960
Tell them you made it up
to help me !

37:09.039 --> 37:11.880
I'm a beforeigner,
they'll go easy on me.

37:11.960 --> 37:13.639
Stop it.

37:14.800 --> 37:18.760
I've already handed in
my resignation to Eriksen.

37:39.480 --> 37:44.320
This is Urd speaking.
Leave a message.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.320
Have a seat.

38:26.440 --> 38:29.039
I can feel that something is wrong.

38:32.039 --> 38:35.760
I have cancer.
Can you chase it away ?

38:39.239 --> 38:40.440
I'm sorry.

38:41.480 --> 38:45.440
My abilities are powerless
against the growing rocks.

38:48.920 --> 38:53.000
Why did you take me in
if you can't save my life ?

38:53.079 --> 38:55.800
Life is not something to be saved.

38:57.360 --> 38:59.639
What is it then ?

39:01.239 --> 39:03.239
Life is a maze.

39:04.559 --> 39:07.119
You must find your way out.

39:13.840 --> 39:16.119
HARBOUR COP:
MEAD TONIGHT ?

39:20.920 --> 39:23.400
HARBOUR COP SENT A PHOTO

39:28.840 --> 39:31.320
What are you trying to tell me ?

39:31.800 --> 39:35.320
Should I off myself ?

39:35.400 --> 39:36.840
It's not that simple.

39:38.840 --> 39:43.360
Nobody breaks out
of the maze unpunished.

39:54.960 --> 39:58.320
But where is the exit
you speak of ?

40:03.559 --> 40:05.320
Give me your blood.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.840
Shit !

40:53.760 --> 40:55.519
Shit !

40:56.760 --> 40:59.679
Does the blood hold any answers ?

40:59.760 --> 41:02.039
I see a creature...

41:03.599 --> 41:05.199
A dog...

41:06.639 --> 41:10.440
Follow the dog,
and you will find your way out.

41:15.599 --> 41:20.199
You're hard to get, but when
you get going, you don't hold back.

41:20.280 --> 41:23.000
We can have mead instead,
if you want.

41:23.079 --> 41:24.639
That's not necessary.

41:47.480 --> 41:49.119
What the fuck are you doing here ?

41:50.480 --> 41:52.440
I said I would be back.

41:58.320 --> 42:00.000
Did you break in ?

42:00.079 --> 42:03.360
Your drug dealer was kind enough
to let me climb down from his unit.

42:05.760 --> 42:08.679
This is not okay.
I'm reporting you.

42:08.760 --> 42:12.480
Lars. Don't you recognize me ?
Lars !

42:12.559 --> 42:14.400
Help ! Help !

42:15.239 --> 42:20.920
We are free men from Viken,
from Olaf the Stout's flock !

42:23.719 --> 42:25.119
It's me.

42:26.039 --> 42:30.079
I was the first one.
The first one in the ocean.

42:30.159 --> 42:32.719
You helped me
from the roof of the Opera house.

42:36.719 --> 42:38.599
Okay...

42:41.119 --> 42:42.360
What do you want from me ?

42:43.800 --> 42:46.280
I just want to help.

42:46.360 --> 42:49.679
I see you're struggling
with these numbers.

42:49.760 --> 42:53.400
I don't blame you, though.
You're missing the beginning.

43:12.960 --> 43:16.639
- Are they GPS coordinates ?
- Of course.

43:16.719 --> 43:18.679
You only write the decimals,

43:18.760 --> 43:23.039
as the entire Oslo fjord
starts with 59 and 10.

43:24.199 --> 43:26.000
Hold on...

43:41.519 --> 43:43.079
It's here, right ?

43:45.079 --> 43:48.679
- Is it the location of a timehole ?
- Bingo !

43:50.199 --> 43:53.239
That's what connects everything.

43:53.320 --> 43:56.159
Ada, Madeleine,
the Tjuvholmen woman,

43:56.239 --> 43:59.480
everything is connected
to this timehole.

44:01.440 --> 44:03.760
How do you know so much
about my case ?

44:05.679 --> 44:07.480
Are you with the police
security service ?

44:09.480 --> 44:12.719
Oh, wouldn't that be something !

44:12.800 --> 44:14.400
No ?

44:16.039 --> 44:17.880
Who do you work for, then ?

44:18.760 --> 44:20.400
I already told you:

44:21.519 --> 44:26.239
He who sacrificed his eye
to drink from the well of Mímir.
