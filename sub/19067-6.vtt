01:07.025 --> 01:08.777
[Robo-warrior]
Stay back.

01:08.860 --> 01:12.406
You have already taken
all our supplies and resources.

01:12.489 --> 01:16.994
My people are loaded on that ark,
ready to leave our beloved home...

01:17.077 --> 01:21.915
before it dissolves completely.
Don't take our only means of escape.

01:21.999 --> 01:25.085
You still have one engine left, Baujal.

01:25.168 --> 01:28.213
Not to mention a very viable
collection of parts.

01:28.297 --> 01:31.341
If your people are strong enough
to survive, they will.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.427
That is the Galra way.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.178
Morvok!
[grunts]

01:42.602 --> 01:44.730
[Allura] There's no point
in debating this further.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.274
Zarkon is clearly tracking us
through me.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.735
[Lance] Aww, space baloney.
[Pidge] That's not possible.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.778
Why would that be so hard to believe?

01:51.862 --> 01:54.906
Zarkon's forces showed up on Arus
only after I awoke.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.575
She's got a point.

01:56.658 --> 02:00.162
I would absolutely
travel across the galaxy to find you.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.749
It's not you, Princess Allura. It's me.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.251
Because?

02:06.335 --> 02:10.964
I just think Zarkon must've imprinted
on me during our fight or something.

02:11.048 --> 02:14.343
Look, the fact is,
we don't know how Zarkon is tracking us.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.219
It could be through the Black Lion.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.556
Every time Zarkon gets close to it,
Shiro has to fight him for control.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.600
That's only when Zarkon is nearby.

02:21.683 --> 02:25.354
No Paladin has ever been able to connect
with a lion over a vast distance.

02:25.437 --> 02:26.730
So what are we going to do?

02:26.813 --> 02:28.815
Look, it doesn't matter
how he's tracking us

02:28.899 --> 02:31.401
because we're gonna take the fight
to the Galra soon enough.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.987
They've been chasing us
from galaxy to galaxy.

02:34.071 --> 02:37.074
The last thing they expect
is for us to come after them.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.118
The hunter becomes the hunted, hmm?
Awesome!

02:40.202 --> 02:42.829
That's the tag line
from like six of my favorite movies.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.624
As it happens, I took our list
of recent Galra attacks

02:45.707 --> 02:49.503
and analyzed it for both commonalities
and anomalies among the attack sites.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.129
I was hoping to create an algorithm

02:51.213 --> 02:54.007
that would, within a statistically
acceptable margin of error,

02:54.091 --> 02:56.718
provide a list
of target-rich Galra environments--

02:56.802 --> 02:59.721
color-coded, of course,
because what are we, animals?

03:01.014 --> 03:02.224
[Lance]
Cool!

03:02.307 --> 03:03.850
What is it again?

03:03.934 --> 03:05.644
[Hunk]
It's a Galra finder?

03:05.727 --> 03:08.230
Well, "finder" suggests
that it locates the Galra,

03:08.313 --> 03:12.317
whereas it would be more accurate to say
that my model predicts their likeliest...

03:13.985 --> 03:15.529
Fine. It's a Galra finder.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.489
So, where are the Galra?

03:17.906 --> 03:21.034
[Pidge] The nearest ones are
right here. A planet called Taujeer.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.619
Then that's where we're headed.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.204
Everyone should get some sleep.

03:24.287 --> 03:27.165
Tomorrow, we'll find that Galra fleet
and take it out.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.920
Is everything okay?

03:32.003 --> 03:33.588
Yeah. Why?

03:33.672 --> 03:35.716
You just seem a bit anxious.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.677
I'm fine. Just tired.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.054
Like you said, I should get some sleep.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.776
-[alarm buzzing]
-Huh?

04:07.581 --> 04:08.832
[growling]

04:08.915 --> 04:11.251
What's the matter, Red? It's me.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.004
[snarling]

04:17.132 --> 04:18.675
[panting]

04:19.676 --> 04:22.637
I can find you anywhere.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.348
[gasps and panting]

04:37.861 --> 04:39.362
-[door slides open]
-Huh?

04:44.159 --> 04:45.911
Princess, what are you doing here?

04:48.205 --> 04:50.749
Oh. I might ask you the same thing.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.502
Nothing. Just walking.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.961
Late at night.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.588
Near the pods.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.633
In full Paladin armor,
with a bag of your belongings?

04:59.716 --> 05:00.717
[sighs]

05:00.801 --> 05:04.638
I have to know if Zarkon is tracking me.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.225
This is the only way.
Don't try to stop me.

05:08.308 --> 05:12.687
I'm not going to stop you.
I'm going to join you.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.819
We should be entering
Taujeer's orbit soon.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.988
[Shiro] Raise the particle barrier.
Scan for Galra.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.241
Where are Keith and Allura?

05:24.324 --> 05:27.244
It appears that one of the pods
launched in the middle of the night.

05:27.327 --> 05:31.122
Wait a minute, Keith and Allura?
In the middle of the night?

05:31.206 --> 05:34.167
You don't think they're sittin' in a tree?

05:34.251 --> 05:37.087
-Contact the pod.
-Yes! Contact that pod!

05:37.170 --> 05:39.297
[Coran]
<i>Princess, Keith, where are you?</i>

05:39.381 --> 05:42.300
Exactly where we should be,
far away from the Castle.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.885
[Shiro]
<i>What? Why?</i>

05:43.969 --> 05:46.805
We must know
if we are the ones Zarkon is tracking.

05:46.888 --> 05:50.392
They're isolating the variable.
Well, isolating two variables.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.227
[Lance] In English, please?

05:52.310 --> 05:53.937
In order to test a hypothesis...

05:54.020 --> 05:55.313
-I said English!
-[groans]

05:55.397 --> 05:56.815
Never mind!

05:56.898 --> 05:59.901
Pidge is right. If Zarkon finds you
despite my absence,

05:59.985 --> 06:03.321
we will know with total certainty
that we are not the ones he is tracking.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.949
[Shiro] <i>Splitting up the group</i>
<i>makes us far more vulnerable.</i>

06:06.032 --> 06:08.577
<i>Come back to the Castle immediately.</i>

06:08.660 --> 06:10.996
I'm sorry, Shiro, I cannot do that.

06:11.079 --> 06:14.165
If Zarkon does find us,
I can pilot us to safety.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.668
We're in wide-open space
with plenty of room to maneuver.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.713
<i>Plus, we'd be able to outrun him.</i>
<i>Pidge added that booster rocket.</i>

06:19.796 --> 06:21.381
That thing's still on there?

06:21.464 --> 06:24.426
-We need both of you back here now!
-[all screaming]

06:24.509 --> 06:25.760
What's goin' on?

06:26.845 --> 06:29.264
[Hunk]
We're in some sort of debris field.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.308
I believe it's coming from Taujeer.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.185
Correction: I think it is Taujeer!

06:34.269 --> 06:35.604
[Allura]
<i>Coran, what's going on--</i>

06:35.687 --> 06:36.938
[static]

06:37.022 --> 06:40.859
Some kind of radiation from the planet
is interfering with communications!

06:40.942 --> 06:43.778
Move the Castle away from the planet
and reestablish the link.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.655
Everyone else, get to your lions.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.879
[gasps]
Something's approaching!

07:05.717 --> 07:07.135
I don't see any Galra.

07:07.218 --> 07:11.056
Looks like that fancy Galra finder
doesn't work. Nice try, Pidge.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.642
Thank goodness you're here!

07:13.725 --> 07:16.561
I am Baujal,
the leader of the Taujeerians.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.814
The Galra just destroyed
our ship's engines and left.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.901
-So the Galra were here. Lance.
-Mmm.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.277
They've taken everything.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.530
We must get everyone off the planet
before it dissolves completely!

07:27.614 --> 07:29.240
Please, help us!

07:29.324 --> 07:31.660
-How long do we have?
-[rumbling]

07:31.743 --> 07:32.953
[Hunk]
Not long.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.413
How did this happen?

07:35.497 --> 07:39.501
We've known for years that our planet
would eventually lose its outer layer.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.711
Like a snake shedding its skin?

07:41.795 --> 07:43.380
Yeah, yeah, that doesn't sound so bad.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.966
Beneath that old skin
is a new, healthy layer, right?

07:46.049 --> 07:49.219
Nope. No, I-- I think
the next layer is acid.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.224
The plan was to evacuate the population
to our nearest moon,

07:54.307 --> 07:57.644
where we have built a colony
to wait out the shedding process.

07:57.727 --> 08:01.147
So we relocated to higher ground
and constructed that ark.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.732
[Lance]
What happened?

08:02.816 --> 08:06.987
[Baujal] The Galra attacked,
led by a vile commander named Morvok.

08:07.070 --> 08:11.491
He robbed us of vital resources and
left us with only one operational engine,

08:11.574 --> 08:12.993
stranding us here.

08:13.076 --> 08:16.079
You're not stranded anymore.
We will save your people.

08:16.162 --> 08:20.792
I believe you, for I have heard
many legends of the valor of Voltron.

08:20.875 --> 08:24.504
Five brave Paladins dedicated to this...
Wait, wait.

08:24.587 --> 08:28.717
I count only four of you.
Are you not Voltron?

08:28.800 --> 08:30.385
Uh... almost?

08:30.468 --> 08:32.095
Where is the fifth Paladin?

08:32.178 --> 08:34.597
He's not here,
but we can still help you.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.851
I would feel more comfortable
with all five Paladins.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.019
Duly noted.

08:39.102 --> 08:42.355
Pidge, Hunk, take a look at the ark
and see what we're dealing with.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.274
Piece of cake.
We'll get it flying in no time.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.650
-[rumbling]
-[gasps]

08:45.734 --> 08:46.943
[crackling]

08:51.239 --> 08:53.491
Would you settle for upright?

08:54.951 --> 08:56.911
[beeping]

08:56.995 --> 09:00.123
We've been here for hours.
Still no sign of Zarkon.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.460
Well, I'm glad
I don't have to wait here alone.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.586
You understand,

09:04.669 --> 09:08.757
I could never live with myself
if Zarkon was finding us because of me.

09:09.382 --> 09:13.178
I must know. We face such a dire threat
from the Galra.

09:13.261 --> 09:16.973
Well, sure, they're bad.
No doubt about that.

09:17.057 --> 09:22.437
But at the same time, couldn't at least
a few of them be fighting for good?

09:22.520 --> 09:26.274
Just look at Ulaz.
He sacrificed himself to save us.

09:26.357 --> 09:29.444
For all we know,
his sacrifice was a ploy.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.030
One life means nothing to Zarkon.

09:32.113 --> 09:35.658
It means something to me. It means
some of them are actually willing to help.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.952
And we could use
all the help we can get!

09:38.036 --> 09:41.873
Any offer of help from the Galra
is merely a prelude to a trap.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.334
I know all too well
how quickly they turn.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.670
It just seems crazy
to lump everyone together.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.839
Listen, if there <i>are </i> any good Galra,

09:49.923 --> 09:52.759
they have had 10,000 years
to take down Zarkon.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.844
I would never count on them for help.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.934
[crackling]

10:04.729 --> 10:06.523
I have located them.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.693
Get me Morvok.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.655
<i>Commander Morvok.</i>

10:13.738 --> 10:15.657
Aaah! Lord Zarkon!

10:15.740 --> 10:18.785
<i>I am sending you coordinates</i>
<i>near your current location.</i>

10:18.868 --> 10:23.081
<i>Voltron is there.</i>
<i>Find it and bring it to me.</i>

10:23.164 --> 10:24.833
Voltron, sire?

10:24.916 --> 10:28.837
<i>Indeed.</i>
<i>Have you received the coordinates?</i>

10:32.173 --> 10:35.176
If I may,
I was able to acquire many resources,

10:35.260 --> 10:39.889
all to glorify your mighty reign,
may it last a thousand centuries.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.059
<i>Your bootlicking</i>
<i>does not impress me, Morvok.</i>

10:43.143 --> 10:45.436
I merely meant
that I could be of even more use

10:45.520 --> 10:47.772
if I were to bring you
these resources instead of...

10:47.856 --> 10:50.191
[Zarkon]
<i>Are you refusing my order?</i>

10:50.733 --> 10:53.653
Of course not!
I will not fail you, Lord Zarkon.

10:53.736 --> 10:57.198
<i>See that you don't. </i> Vrepit sa.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.491
<i>Vrepit sa.</i>

11:01.703 --> 11:04.914
[Pidge] Assuming we can get it
back up, the repairs will still take time.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.333
[Lance] Which would appear to be
the one thing we don't have.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.335
We need to slow down the shedding.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.505
How do you stop a planet
that's coming apart at the seams?

11:12.589 --> 11:14.424
By sewing it back together!

11:14.507 --> 11:15.842
What do you mean?

11:15.925 --> 11:18.803
That new Green Lion weapon
causes vegetation to grow, right?

11:18.887 --> 11:21.222
Well, I was thinking that if you aim it
at the cracks in the planet...

11:21.306 --> 11:22.974
the vines could act like stitches.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.019
But won't the stitches get dissolved
by the acid?

11:26.102 --> 11:29.314
The stitches might hold longer
if they're frozen.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.690
It's a plan.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.234
Hunk, you and I will take our lions
and get this ark upright

11:33.318 --> 11:34.986
while Pidge and Lance buy us some time.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.071
[cracking]

11:47.123 --> 11:50.168
[Hunk] My side's clear, Shiro.
[Shiro] Almost done.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.129
Yes! It worked!

11:53.212 --> 11:55.715
It won't hold forever. Keep going!

11:55.798 --> 11:58.968
[grunting]

12:00.637 --> 12:03.306
[Shiro]
Come on! Give it all you got.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.476
That's it! We're almost there.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.103
Thanks, guys.

12:09.187 --> 12:10.396
[Lance] You got it.
[Pidge] Anytime.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.652
[cheering]

12:15.735 --> 12:18.905
[Shiro] All right, Hunk,
time to work on those engines.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.992
[Keith] So, what happens
if Zarkon does come after us?

12:23.076 --> 12:25.870
You said you could pilot us
to safety, right?

12:25.954 --> 12:29.415
Sure, but after that,
could we even go back to the group?

12:29.499 --> 12:33.836
And if we don't, who would
pilot the Castle or create wormholes?

12:33.920 --> 12:37.674
Well, what about you? Without you,
the team cannot form Voltron.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.516
Well, it ain't pretty,
but it should get you airborne--

12:46.599 --> 12:48.685
[rumbling]

12:51.062 --> 12:52.271
Just in time.

12:52.355 --> 12:55.942
[sputters and ignites]

13:05.868 --> 13:06.786
What was that?

13:06.869 --> 13:08.538
The Galra. They're back.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.628
[rumbling]

13:15.712 --> 13:17.296
[gasping and yelling]

13:17.380 --> 13:20.383
[Shiro] Hunk! Take the Yellow Lion
and hold up the ark.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.594
If it falls into the acid,
the Taujeerians are doomed.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.180
[Hunk] Not to mention
the guy beneath them.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.725
Which would be me,
in this particular scenario.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.395
Lance, Pidge,
we've got to draw the cruiser's fire.

13:32.478 --> 13:36.315
Coran, we need you here now.
Attack the Galra cruiser!

13:36.399 --> 13:37.817
[Coran]
I'm on my way!

13:39.277 --> 13:42.613
- [Coran] <i>Keith, Allura, are you there?</i>
- We're here, Coran. What is it?

13:42.697 --> 13:45.616
<i>Zarkon is definitely</i>
<i>not tracking us through either of you.</i>

13:45.700 --> 13:47.618
- He's not?
- How do you know?

13:47.702 --> 13:50.496
<i>Because you're out there,</i>
<i>and a Galra fleet just showed up here!</i>

13:50.580 --> 13:52.331
<i>We need you now!</i>

13:54.500 --> 13:56.085
[Allura]
We'll be there in two <i>doboshes.</i>

13:56.169 --> 13:58.087
[Keith]
Even faster than that.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.297
What is that?

13:59.380 --> 14:01.340
It's the booster fuel
Pidge added to this pod.

14:01.424 --> 14:03.384
[engines charging]

14:04.218 --> 14:05.511
-Aaah!
-Aah!

14:05.595 --> 14:07.597
[both screaming]

14:08.765 --> 14:11.017
[panting]

14:13.644 --> 14:16.647
Allura! [grunts]
Grab my hand!

14:19.025 --> 14:21.110
-[grunting]
-[panting]

14:24.364 --> 14:26.657
[panting]

14:28.785 --> 14:30.953
Princess, are you okay?

14:31.662 --> 14:34.457
I believe so.
Is your radio still working?

14:34.540 --> 14:35.792
Let's find out.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.543
Coran, can you hear me?

14:37.627 --> 14:39.295
[static on radio]

14:40.505 --> 14:43.800
This is going far better
than I anticipated.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.844
We could actually capture Voltron!

14:46.928 --> 14:48.930
I could get transferred back to the hub.

14:49.806 --> 14:53.601
And they said I wasn't good enough
to be in the hub.

14:54.102 --> 14:55.019
[gasps]

14:55.103 --> 14:58.773
Maybe Zarkon will invite me to sit
in his box at the gladiator matches!

14:58.856 --> 15:00.274
The ultimate honor!

15:00.358 --> 15:02.902
Sir! Three Voltron Lions incoming!

15:02.985 --> 15:05.363
[Morvok]
Fire on them with our full arsenal!

15:13.621 --> 15:15.415
-[rumbling]
-Keep firing!

15:15.498 --> 15:18.084
[Galra soldier] Sir, the lions
are moving too fast for us to hit.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.670
Well, let's make them stay in one place!

15:20.753 --> 15:26.092
Train the ion cannon on the ark.
Sink the entire thing into the acid!

15:29.595 --> 15:31.514
[beeping]

15:32.265 --> 15:34.183
[Shiro] They're aiming
the ion cannon at the ark!

15:34.267 --> 15:37.437
Lance! Pidge!
Attack the ship with your jaw blades!

15:51.284 --> 15:53.202
[Keith]
We'll never get there at this rate.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.704
This was a terrible mistake.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.498
Shiro was right.
We never should have left them.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.765
[rumbling]

16:14.849 --> 16:16.476
[grunting]

16:16.559 --> 16:18.853
Rocks! Big, big rocks!

16:18.936 --> 16:20.563
[Lance]
We got you, buddy.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.274
What happened?

16:23.357 --> 16:25.067
[Galra soldier]
The Black Lion attacked the cannon.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.986
He's disabled
our projectile guidance system.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.655
We won't be able to aim the cannon
until it's fixed.

16:29.739 --> 16:33.701
Fix it! Full attack!
Fire with everything we've got!

16:44.212 --> 16:45.254
[whimpers]

16:48.716 --> 16:50.343
Way to go, Coran!

16:50.426 --> 16:52.053
<i>Hunk, what's your status?</i>

16:52.136 --> 16:55.431
Mostly just trying not to fall
into a bubbling pot of acid.

16:55.515 --> 16:59.769
Divert all shields to the main hull!
Focus full firepower on their ship!

17:02.605 --> 17:04.941
[Lance] We're being overwhelmed!
[Pidge] We need Voltron!

17:06.608 --> 17:09.569
Oh, if only there were another
who could pilot the Red Lion.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.753
Finally, Alfor.
I will walk in your footsteps!

17:27.338 --> 17:30.424
Oh, Red Lion,
I am unworthy to be your Paladin,

17:30.508 --> 17:33.678
but since you have chosen
to bestow this honor upon me,

17:33.761 --> 17:36.514
Coran Hieronymus Wimbleton Smythe,

17:36.597 --> 17:38.558
I humbly accept.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.395
[low growl]

17:42.478 --> 17:43.688
Oh, yes!

17:47.650 --> 17:49.735
Right. Okay. Just a quick lap.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.864
[rocket booster fire]

17:53.948 --> 17:57.034
Uh, okay, guys? So, yeah...

17:57.118 --> 17:59.120
the-- the Red Lion ran away.

17:59.954 --> 18:03.374
[rumbling]

18:03.457 --> 18:05.585
I can't hold it any longer!

18:05.668 --> 18:09.005
Hunk, you have to! If you let go,
the Taujeerians will die!

18:11.173 --> 18:12.842
[metal creaking]

18:12.925 --> 18:14.760
[grunting]

18:14.844 --> 18:16.429
[screams]

18:17.847 --> 18:18.681
[growls]

18:25.563 --> 18:26.856
Oh, whoa!

18:26.939 --> 18:28.274
Armor claws!

18:31.277 --> 18:33.571
Guys, I can keep this thing
from falling any farther

18:33.654 --> 18:35.531
but I need your help to get it back up.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.866
[Shiro]
We're on our way!

18:42.830 --> 18:44.957
-[Allura] Keith, look!
-Huh?

18:45.041 --> 18:46.917
The Red Lion found you!

18:47.001 --> 18:48.669
[low growl]

18:49.295 --> 18:51.297
[beeping]

18:51.380 --> 18:54.508
Sir, the ion cannon's guidance system
is back online.

18:54.592 --> 18:57.261
And the lions appear to have gathered
beneath the ark.

18:57.345 --> 19:00.723
Perfect! The lions will go down with it.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.016
Fire when ready!

19:04.101 --> 19:06.228
[rapid beeping]

19:20.201 --> 19:21.827
-[cheering]
-All right!

19:21.911 --> 19:23.162
Good to have you back, Keith.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.622
Good to be back.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.582
-Is the Princess with you?
-Yes.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.959
Like "with you" with you, or...

19:29.043 --> 19:30.836
Uh, Keith? Little help?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.046
On my way, buddy.

19:40.429 --> 19:44.016
All right, everybody. No time to relax.
Let's show them what they're dealing with.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.685
Form Voltron!

19:46.352 --> 19:47.770
[roaring]

20:23.889 --> 20:27.893
Sir, our weapons systems are knocked out
completely. Should we retreat?

20:27.977 --> 20:30.938
Never! Aim the ship at the ark!

20:31.021 --> 20:33.733
We will take it down ourselves.

20:33.816 --> 20:37.820
To die for the Galra Empire
is the greatest honor imaginable.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.071
<i>Vrepit sa!</i>

20:39.572 --> 20:40.740
[soldiers]
<i>Vrepit sa!</i>

20:41.866 --> 20:43.659
Prepare my escape pod.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.998
[Pidge] They're heading for the ark!
[Hunk] They're gonna ram it!

20:49.081 --> 20:51.584
We'll have to meet them head-on.
Form sword!

20:55.087 --> 20:58.090
[Lance] Will the sword be able
to cut through an entire battle cruiser?

20:58.174 --> 20:59.550
[Shiro]
It'll have to!

21:00.509 --> 21:03.220
Guys, I think my lion
is telling me something.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.764
Yeah, mine too.

21:04.847 --> 21:07.308
-I can feel it too.
-Same here.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.642
Then do it!

21:28.037 --> 21:30.790
-Yes!
-Yeah!

21:33.167 --> 21:35.461
[Shiro] Now let's get
the Taujeerians to safety.

21:35.544 --> 21:38.214
<i>How are we going to do that?</i>
<i>Their booster rockets are shot.</i>

21:38.297 --> 21:39.507
[rumbling]

21:41.842 --> 21:44.261
-[thud]
-[gasping]

22:05.491 --> 22:08.077
I'm so sorry for leaving.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.121
Me too. We thought
we were doing the right thing.

22:11.205 --> 22:15.835
But clearly you were correct, Shiro.
We are always stronger together.

22:15.918 --> 22:18.295
At least we learned that Zarkon
isn't tracking us through you two.

22:18.379 --> 22:21.882
Plus, I learned that my lion can grow
armor and extend its claws like that...

22:21.966 --> 22:25.177
Ting! Which will come in handy
if we ever needed to, say,

22:25.261 --> 22:27.846
I don't know, slice up a giant steak
while getting beat up.

22:28.889 --> 22:32.226
Or fight evil and save innocent people.
That too. That would work.

22:32.309 --> 22:35.563
The fact that the Red Lion came
to help Keith from so far away

22:35.646 --> 22:37.648
is a vital piece of information.

22:37.731 --> 22:40.776
We now have proof that a lion
and a Paladin can, in fact,

22:40.859 --> 22:44.405
connect over a far greater distance
than we realized.

22:44.488 --> 22:48.033
Which means we finally know
how Zarkon is tracking us.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.286
It's through the Black Lion.

22:51.305 --> 22:57.320
