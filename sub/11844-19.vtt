Alex was killed in a car crash,
which usually means accident...

00:04.871 --> 00:08.000
<i>but the police thought
it could be a suicide.</i>

00:08.074 --> 00:11.066
<i>Now, those of us who knew Alex know that
he would never, ever do something like that...</i>

00:11.144 --> 00:13.306
which is why I went back
to “accident”...

00:13.380 --> 00:15.906
<i>and Liz, she went
somewhere else entirely.</i>

00:15.982 --> 00:19.612
<i>She has decided that Alex
was murdered by an alien...</i>

00:19.686 --> 00:22.678
which is why now there's
this huge rift between Max and Liz.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.384
<i>It's beyond the worst fight
they've ever had.</i>

00:25.458 --> 00:28.223
<i>But I think that Liz will be able
to keep pursuing this...</i>

00:28.294 --> 00:30.228
<i>without any interference from Max...</i>

00:30.296 --> 00:32.890
<i>because he's been
a little preoccupied lately.</i>

00:32.966 --> 00:36.061
It was just one kiss,
a moment of weakness.

Alex and his supposed girlfriend Leanna
standing in front of some building in Sweden.

04:10.650 --> 04:14.416
Now, the problem is,
the building was torn down in 1994.

04:14.487 --> 04:17.387
1994? Maria, think about it.

04:17.457 --> 04:19.789
Alex was 1 O.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.725
So who's Leanna, then?

Could be some girl Alex never met- put in
these photos with him just like the buildings.

04:33.139 --> 04:36.439
Or she could be an alien killer.

04:36.509 --> 04:40.343

and he wasn't here...

and I went to Derek.</i>

- Mm-hmm.

Liz doesn't want us to know
because she and Max are at war.

16:24.281 --> 16:26.807
So here's the thing-
I'm not gonna tell Max.

16:26.884 --> 16:29.910
But I need to know because if wherever
you're going turns out to be dangerous...

16:32.589 --> 16:35.581

I will lose her as a friend.

aren't in school today.

17:04.387 --> 17:07.186

- Any idea where they are?

17:07.257 --> 17:09.191
None.

17:09.259 --> 17:12.422

to deal with already.

17:14.964 --> 17:16.990

<i>Mine sucks too.</i>

17:29.880 --> 17:32.611
<i>lust stuff I you know?</i>

17:32.683 --> 17:34.947
Relationship stuff.

17:35.018 --> 17:38.648
- Well, Tess and I are sort of-
- Yeah, I know.

17:38.722 --> 17:42.522
The thing is, the other night
things between us kind of advanced.

17:45.496 --> 17:47.464
How far did they advance?

17:47.531 --> 17:50.796
I would say they advanced
just about as far as possible.

17:50.868 --> 17:54.634
You and Tess actually had-

17:54.705 --> 17:57.231
Hot alien sex, yes.

18:00.511 --> 18:03.208
How was it?

18:03.280 --> 18:05.874
Well, it's probably a lot
like human sex...

18:05.949 --> 18:08.782
except the point of culmination.

18:08.852 --> 18:10.843
The point of what?

18:12.055 --> 18:14.387
You kind of feel like you're floating...

18:14.458 --> 18:16.950
and this hot electric energy
courses through your body.

18:17.027 --> 18:19.394
How long does that last?

18:21.732 --> 18:23.723
About an hour.

18:27.871 --> 18:30.863
The thing is,
there's been a complication.

18:30.941 --> 18:33.410
What, alien herpes?

18:33.477 --> 18:36.469
No, nothing like that.

18:36.547 --> 18:39.141
Well, clearly you didn't have...

18:39.216 --> 18:42.311
any performance problems.

18:42.386 --> 18:45.947
And other than getting Tess pregnant,
which you're too smart to do...

18:46.023 --> 18:48.014
what else could there be?

18:49.960 --> 18:52.861
You got Tess pregnant?

18:54.231 --> 18:56.393
<i>Holy crap.</i>

18:56.466 --> 18:59.231
And she says it's growing fast.

18:59.303 --> 19:02.898
Nasedo said alien pregnancies
take about a month.

19:04.241 --> 19:07.677
What's inside her?
I mean, is it human? Is it alien?

19:07.744 --> 19:11.908
- We can't exactly get a sonogram.
- You're actually gonna go through with this?

19:11.982 --> 19:14.644
I don't know if I have any choice here.

19:14.718 --> 19:18.985
This is out of my hands.
I can't tell Tess what to do.

19:19.056 --> 19:22.515
- Why not? You're the king.
- Which makes her the queen.

19:22.593 --> 19:24.891
Maxwell...

19:24.962 --> 19:28.125
if this thing comes out green
with four fingers and three eyes...

19:28.198 --> 19:31.099
that puts a major crimp
in our hide-in-plain-sight strategy.

19:31.168 --> 19:33.227
So what are you suggesting?

19:33.303 --> 19:38.207
I'm suggesting you point out to Tess how this
could screw up all of our lives... forever.

19:38.275 --> 19:40.903
She's gotta know this affects all of us.

20:01.498 --> 20:03.557
- Totally empty.
- Nothing.

<i>Excuse me.

20:15.045 --> 20:17.036
Uh, yeah, um, actually.

20:17.114 --> 20:19.583
We are looking for our friend.
He was staying in this dorm for a while.

20:19.650 --> 20:21.618
- Ray.
- Ray?

20:21.685 --> 20:24.416
- Yes. Ray.
- He was here for a couple of months.

20:24.488 --> 20:28.083
Hardly said a word.
Very weird guy.

20:28.158 --> 20:32.095
Did he say what he was doing here,
why he came in the middle of a semester?

20:32.162 --> 20:33.789
<i>You don't understand.
Ray never left the room.</i>

20:33.864 --> 20:36.265
<i>The only time he opened the door
was when they delivered his Thai food.</i>

20:36.333 --> 20:40.600
- Thai food?
- Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Every day.

20:40.671 --> 20:42.765
<i>Food fetish, if you ask me.</i>

20:42.839 --> 20:45.570
So wait, you mean he literally
never left the dorm?

20:45.642 --> 20:50.307
<i>At least not in the daytime. There was one
night I was out partying and I come back late.</i>

20:50.380 --> 20:53.543
<i>I saw him coming out of the Litvack building.
It's like 4:00 in the morning.</i>

We're the only two people on campus.
We're five feet away from each other.

<i>The guy doesn't even acknowledge
my presence. Pretty creepy.</i>

- Computers.

21:20.911 --> 21:23.676
This is everything we have
from where we come from.

21:26.583 --> 21:28.984
This book.

21:29.052 --> 21:32.283
If we knew how to read it, it would
probably have all the answers for us.

21:32.355 --> 21:35.518
What answers are we looking for?

21:37.527 --> 21:40.462
I guess answers about what exactly
we're getting ourselves into.

21:42.632 --> 21:45.294

21:45.368 --> 21:47.860

is in the field of cryptography.

All the answers, Michael.
Even if Leanna has them, now so do we.

34:47.583 --> 34:50.780
You slept a few hours.
How are you doin'?

34:50.853 --> 34:53.844
- Better.
- You warm enough?

34:55.291 --> 34:58.420
I'm okay. How's it going?

34:58.494 --> 35:00.656
With the book.

35:00.729 --> 35:03.221
I have no idea how to read it.

35:03.299 --> 35:05.961
That's the truth.

I thought-
I wish I did, but I don't.

35:11.640 --> 35:14.632
I feel like I'm letting you down.

I have faith in you, Max.

35:24.887 --> 35:26.821
I always have.

When that happened before...

35:42.404 --> 35:44.395
when you fell...

35:46.575 --> 35:49.169
I guess I suddenly realized
that I could lose you.

35:49.244 --> 35:53.613
All this time I thought of you
as this person that wouldjust...

35:53.682 --> 35:55.616

35:57.419 --> 35:59.410
Forever.

36:02.191 --> 36:04.683
I've been taking you for granted.

I'm sorry about that.

Okay, but can we, like,

36:40.629 --> 36:44.964

- What about, like, getting back at Max?

36:45.033 --> 36:46.967
I'm over Max.

- What?

38:00.909 --> 38:05.813
She's pregnant, and the baby's dying
because it can't live in this atmosphere.

First is, I've been lying to you about

I've been helping 'em.
