00:29.120 --> 00:30.120
[beeps]

00:34.720 --> 00:36.240
It'll all be over soon.

00:36.320 --> 00:37.400
Can't wait, baby.

00:38.080 --> 00:41.480
-You know what to do, right?
-Always. [chuckles]

00:47.920 --> 00:49.920
[theme music playing]

01:13.880 --> 01:15.840
[footsteps approaching]

01:17.280 --> 01:18.720
[Jason] Wait, where's the magnetite?

01:19.400 --> 01:22.720
What? Did you think I'd bring
that poisonous rock here?

01:24.440 --> 01:27.760
I found the perfect place to store it.

01:31.960 --> 01:34.640
This new piece of magnetite
caught me off guard, I admit.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.080
But then I thought,
"When life gives you lemons,

01:39.280 --> 01:42.640
spread a deadly virus
while drinking your lemonade."

01:43.640 --> 01:46.840
-What?
-Next time someone walks into that cave,

01:46.920 --> 01:50.440
<i>we'll trigger a mechanism</i>
<i>to heat up the magnetite,</i>

01:50.520 --> 01:54.640
then the whole world will witness
what this virus can do.

01:54.720 --> 01:59.040
Or what it can't, which is, be cured.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.840
But people might be able to figure out
an antidote

02:01.920 --> 02:05.880
-if they have access to the virus.
-Yeah. I thought about that, too.

02:06.440 --> 02:09.360
<i>The whole place is set to blow up</i>
<i>once they leave the cave.</i>

02:09.440 --> 02:10.600
[beeping]

02:11.240 --> 02:13.120
But why... why would anyone
go there, anyway?

02:14.840 --> 02:18.440
What? Don't tell me
you thought of something.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.360
[beeping continues]

02:30.760 --> 02:32.560
[beeps rapidly and stops]

02:34.360 --> 02:36.040
[crowd cheering on TV]

02:36.120 --> 02:38.200
[commentator on TV]<i> Now the Rams</i>
<i>have a chance to put the game away...</i>

02:38.280 --> 02:39.560
[Carter] Hey, you.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.080
Why is it I feel like
we live ten feet away from each other,

02:44.160 --> 02:45.240
and yet I never see you?

02:45.320 --> 02:47.440
Yeah? They keep us, uh, pretty busy here.

02:47.520 --> 02:51.360
Well, sit down. What a coincidence,
the Eagles are playing Los Angeles.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.560
How is the life of an Eagle, anyway?

02:54.640 --> 02:58.040
Actually, they're not so good
with dealing with losses.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.320
-My Eagles, I mean.
-Oh.

03:00.160 --> 03:03.200
You know, I was the one who convinced
your mother to let you stay there.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.200
-Really?
-Yes.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.040
'Cause I trust you, Hayley.
You know what you're doing.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.560
Thanks, Dad.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.880
[commentator continues]

03:11.960 --> 03:13.720
Oh, come on.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.160
[commentator]
<i>Now they'll have to spike it.</i>

03:18.520 --> 03:20.360
[beeping in distance]

03:20.440 --> 03:23.600
[commentator] <i>And it's second and goal</i>
<i>with eight seconds left on the clock.</i>

03:23.680 --> 03:24.680
<i>Rams, five guys...</i>

03:24.760 --> 03:26.200
Do you hear that?

03:26.720 --> 03:28.320
-What?
-Listen.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.200
-[TV volume decreases]
-[beeping continues]

03:32.760 --> 03:34.640
Ah, it's probably just a car alarm.

03:35.320 --> 03:39.320
No, it's too high-pitched.
Dad, you don't hear this?

03:40.920 --> 03:43.040
Thanks for the reminder that I'm old.

03:43.120 --> 03:46.360
-[beeping continues]
-I know that sound.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.240
So, Enzo gave this to you?

03:49.320 --> 03:51.560
His grandmother had a stroke.
He had to race out of here.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.040
That is so sad.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.880
He said his job
was to take care of her now,

03:54.960 --> 03:56.400
like she took care of him growing up.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.760
Oh, my goodness. What a good kid.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.080
Totally.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.960
I'm so pissed. I needed a lightbulb
for my makeup mirror,

04:03.040 --> 04:06.600
and it turns out, that groundskeeper,
he quit this afternoon.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.960
And his room was locked,
so I couldn't even get inside.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.000
-Hey, psst! Did you hear that?
-What?

04:11.080 --> 04:14.120
-Enzo quit today.
-Seriously?

04:14.920 --> 04:16.040
That's great.

04:17.240 --> 04:18.280
Isn't that great?

04:19.320 --> 04:21.079
I don't know. I guess.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.320
Oh, my God. The magnetite.

04:24.399 --> 04:28.120
-Do you think he stole it?
-No, no, no. He called it moon crap.

04:28.200 --> 04:31.640
Yeah, moon crap that's worth
thousands of dollars.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.400
Oh, man.

04:33.480 --> 04:34.440
I'm gonna call Max.

04:41.520 --> 04:45.320
-No.
-I knew it. Ugh! That scumbag!

04:45.400 --> 04:47.520
What were we thinking?

04:47.600 --> 04:49.560
You're the one who told us
we should do what he said.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.600
-Okay, it's time to tell Ryan everything.
-No!

04:51.680 --> 04:54.200
No, no, no, no.
We talked about this already, okay?

04:54.280 --> 04:56.880
We will be kicked out in a heartbeat
if she finds out what we did.

04:56.960 --> 05:00.760
But what about the magnetite?
We have to tell everyone it's dangerous.

05:00.840 --> 05:03.440
Why? I mean, he stole it.
It's his problem now.

05:03.520 --> 05:04.760
What if it ends up hurting
innocent people?

05:04.840 --> 05:06.760
What, you think he's gonna donate it
to the Smithsonian?

05:06.840 --> 05:11.960
Listen, whoever ends up with that rock
will be just as slimy as he is, okay?

05:12.040 --> 05:14.680
-Yeah, you're probably right about that.
-Thank you.

05:14.760 --> 05:18.040
I mean, besides, what are the chances
someone heats it up, anyway?

05:18.120 --> 05:21.000
I mean, that thing sat in a cave
for a hundred--

05:21.080 --> 05:23.080
Thousands. Hundreds of thousands of years.

05:23.160 --> 05:25.400
-I was gonna say that--
-Okay, okay, okay.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.960
Guys, we take this to the grave.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.880
[crowd cheering on TV]

05:35.960 --> 05:37.680
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.040
-What's the score?
-Uh, just finished.

05:41.120 --> 05:45.360
Big shocker, Los Angeles lost again.
Damn Eagles.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.160
[sighs] Well, my groundskeeper just quit.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.360
[both] Really?

05:49.440 --> 05:54.800
You know, I thought I came here
to work with students, not broken pipes.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.280
Speaking about broken,

05:56.360 --> 05:59.560
there's this crazy beeping sound
in the house all night. Listen.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.520
It was here, I swear.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.640
Well, I don't have anyone
to fix it right now.

06:07.720 --> 06:10.360
I'll... I'll try
and deal with it tomorrow.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.160
Actually, uh,
we have that winery tour tomorrow.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.200
-Oh...
-What? But Mom hates wine.

06:15.280 --> 06:18.280
Yes, but she likes the big donors
for the school.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.000
-Ah...
-[Ryan clicks tongue]

06:20.080 --> 06:23.320
Well, in that case, I'm going to bed.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.520
[Brooke] At one point,
I felt this tugging on my life jacket,

06:27.600 --> 06:30.520
-and realized it was Max holding onto me.
-[chuckles]

06:31.560 --> 06:32.720
[Brooke] Hey!

06:32.800 --> 06:34.240
Hey. Hey.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.080
Um... Okay.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.480
-Hi. Can I have a chocolate shake, please?
-Sure.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.440
[Brooke] ...hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

06:44.520 --> 06:47.320
Right. You were hypnotized,
locked in a cave,

06:47.400 --> 06:49.120
-watched your brother go to prison...
-[beeping in distance]

06:49.200 --> 06:50.960
[Leo] ...and that's the hardest thing
you've ever had to do?

06:53.920 --> 06:55.920
The beeping came from the cave!

06:56.600 --> 06:57.960
Hayley, are... are you okay?

07:01.040 --> 07:05.440
Guys, I have to tell you something.
I was at my parents' place...

07:05.520 --> 07:09.920
I mean, the headmaster's residence,
and I heard this beeping sound,

07:10.000 --> 07:13.440
and I swear I could have heard it before.
It was sort of like a...

07:13.960 --> 07:16.520
[imitating beeping]

07:16.600 --> 07:19.400
And now I've realized it was
the beeping sound I heard in the cave

07:19.480 --> 07:21.520
when I was locked in there with my mom!

07:22.280 --> 07:26.480
It came from behind the wall
in the far corner of the kitchen.

07:26.560 --> 07:27.840
What's behind that wall?

07:29.040 --> 07:30.440
My brother's old room.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.360
[beeping in distance]

07:47.360 --> 07:49.320
[beeping continues]

07:50.720 --> 07:51.920
Do you hear it?

07:56.080 --> 08:02.280
You're right. It is similar to the beeping
from the cave. But... I don't know.

08:03.960 --> 08:07.920
That's it. I'm sure of it.
I'll never forget that sound.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.760
I think it's coming from there.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.040
Wait.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.200
What is this?

08:40.280 --> 08:43.320
[beeping louder]

08:45.720 --> 08:47.400
Oh, my God.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.120
My fricking brother.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.640
[doorbell rings]

09:03.720 --> 09:05.000
Come with me.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.600
Hey, babe. I just wanted to check on--

09:15.560 --> 09:18.480
Oh. Apparently, you're doing just fine.

09:18.560 --> 09:19.560
[Hayley] Daniel...

09:20.440 --> 09:24.080
Daniel. Daniel, come on.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.080
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but it's not what you think.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.560
Oh, so I didn't see you alone
in the living room with Leo?

09:28.640 --> 09:31.920
No. Actually, you didn't.
Brooke was there, too, and we were--

09:32.000 --> 09:34.360
You just really must miss
those Ravens, huh?

09:35.120 --> 09:38.080
You know what? Yeah.
Yeah, I do, sometimes.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.120
But that's not the point here, Daniel.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.440
What is the point, Hayley?

09:45.920 --> 09:47.240
That I love you.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.400
Okay? Now, please come with me.

09:55.480 --> 09:58.080
You have to see this.
We found something crazy.

09:58.880 --> 10:02.240
That rat. I can't believe
he had this all set up.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.240
What the hell is this place?

10:08.320 --> 10:11.960
Looks like some sort of connection
to the cave. And look at that.

10:13.120 --> 10:16.680
-Do you think that's the door to the cave?
-It must be. Think.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.840
This is how Jason
was able to control so much

10:18.920 --> 10:20.080
while still working at the Greenhouse.

10:20.160 --> 10:23.240
If my dad saw this, it would kill him.

10:23.320 --> 10:26.520
-We should tell your mom.
-No. She's really overwhelmed right now.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.520
I mean, eventually, but first,

10:29.600 --> 10:32.800
let's figure out what this is
before we get everyone worried.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.400
And it's probably nothing.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.960
Maybe something's shorted in the cave,
and that's what caused the beeping.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.800
-We could go down there and shut it off.
-What? Are you kidding me?

10:40.880 --> 10:44.400
The last time I went down into that cave,
a bomb was about to go off.

10:44.480 --> 10:48.200
Okay. But the police swept the cave.
There shouldn't be anything dangerous.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.800
Look, two of us can stay here,
and two of us can go down there.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.160
It's too dark now.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.880
But my parents are out tomorrow morning,
so we could do it then.

10:54.960 --> 10:58.960
Okay. After breakfast,
we all meet back up.

11:03.080 --> 11:03.960
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.840
-[Daniel] Yo. What's up, dude?
-[Sophie] What's up, guys?

11:05.920 --> 11:07.240
-Hey, what's up, buddy? You good?
-Hey.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.720
Yeah. I'm good.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.080
<i>-Bon appétit.</i>
-What? This is preventative.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.720
I need something to soak up all the wine.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.840
[beeping]

11:35.920 --> 11:38.000
-[Daniel sighs] Damn it!
-What?

11:38.080 --> 11:41.800
Coach wants us for an emergency practice
in the gym. He's still not over that loss.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.120
-We'll be quick.
-[Leo] All right, then, let's do this.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.720
You and Brooke stay here.
Me and Daniel will run down to the cave,

11:46.800 --> 11:48.200
and you open the door when we get there.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.760
We'll check it out, and give you a call
when we need the door open again.

11:50.840 --> 11:54.120
Wait, but your Louies won't work
in the cave. There's no reception there.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.000
How long do you think it'll take you guys?

11:56.080 --> 11:57.960
Couple of minutes? Five?

11:58.040 --> 11:59.320
[Hayley] Okay, so we'll time it.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.960
We'll re-open the cave after five minutes,
and you guys have to call us

12:02.040 --> 12:03.760
after you leave the cave when you're done.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.720
Okay. All right, well, let's go.
We have to make it quick.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.640
[Hayley] Bye.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.120
Does this feel like déjà vu to you?

12:16.040 --> 12:18.360
[sighs] Man, this place
gives me the creeps.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.440
-[Louie ringing]
-Hold on.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.360
-What?
-[sighs]

12:24.440 --> 12:25.800
[Louie continues ringing]

12:27.880 --> 12:28.800
Hello?

12:28.880 --> 12:30.080
Where the hell are you?

12:31.840 --> 12:35.960
I, uh... Something came up.
I'll be there in 15 minutes, Coach.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.160
If you're not here in two,
you're off the team.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.560
[sighs] Crap.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.360
-What's going on?
-[Louie ringing]

12:43.920 --> 12:46.160
-Hello?
-Hey, are you there yet?

12:46.240 --> 12:48.400
[Daniel sighs] <i>No, um... Look,</i>

12:48.480 --> 12:51.400
Coach said he'd kick me off the team
if I don't get there right now.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.920
What do I do?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.400
I guess you should do
what you think you need to do.

12:55.480 --> 12:58.080
[sighs] Okay.

12:59.760 --> 13:02.000
I'll be back. All right? I gotta go.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.960
-[Leo] Seriously?
-[Daniel] I have to.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.400
[Coach Davies whistles] Do it again.
You look weak.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.600
I'm here, Coach.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.640
Get your uniform on
and get out there. Now.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.400
Okay, I'm here. You can open the door.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.040
Wait, just one minute.

13:22.120 --> 13:23.120
[Leo] <i>Wait? Wait for what?</i>

13:23.200 --> 13:24.480
[Hayley] For me.

13:26.040 --> 13:29.040
-What are you doing here?
-Think I would let you go in there alone?

13:40.280 --> 13:41.840
Partners in crime again, Woods?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.520
So it seems, Cruz.

13:52.960 --> 13:55.920
[Jason] But you were going for Ryan
or her stupid husband.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.760
That's why we put the beeping device
in their apartment.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.080
This is better.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.520
-More entertaining, in a way.
-[Jason] They're only kids!

14:03.600 --> 14:07.560
[client] Yeah, two kids responsible
for you going to prison, remember?

14:09.160 --> 14:12.560
This is sweet revenge for you, buddy.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.600
[snaps fingers]
Start heating the magnetite.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.360
[beeping]

14:26.480 --> 14:27.600
There.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.840
-[both sigh]
-Thank God. Thank God.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.520
I was hearing that in my sleep last night.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.800
Well, uh, mission accomplished.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.520
-Now what?
-Uh, I don't know.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.920
I guess we wait four and a half minutes
till Brooke opens the door.

14:47.080 --> 14:49.360
Well, that's about four more minutes
than I've spent with you

14:49.440 --> 14:52.440
-in about three months, so I'll take it.
-[chuckles softly]

14:58.080 --> 14:59.280
So, how are you?

15:00.080 --> 15:03.640
Um, I'm good. Mostly good.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.640
Can anyone ever be all good?

15:08.040 --> 15:10.080
Never afraid to ask the deep questions,
are you, Woods?

15:10.160 --> 15:11.000
[chuckles]

15:15.360 --> 15:16.360
[Ryan] Is anybody here?

15:24.160 --> 15:27.680
[exclaims] Brooke!
What are you doing here?

15:28.360 --> 15:31.160
Hayley let me in. I was, um...

15:32.360 --> 15:34.600
looking for a necklace that I lost
when I used to live here.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.200
Well, wasn't this your brother's old room?

15:37.800 --> 15:42.360
Yeah. But, um, it was my mother's necklace
and my brother took it.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.760
Oh, that's terrible.
Uh, let me help you look.

15:45.840 --> 15:46.680
Oh, okay.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.840
Um, weren't you...

15:49.920 --> 15:53.600
Um, Hayley said that you were supposed
to be somewhere today?

15:53.680 --> 15:59.080
Yeah, we were on our way to a winery,
and, uh, I forgot my allergy pills.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.840
I am allergic to every plant
known to man. [laughs]

16:02.920 --> 16:04.880
So, I figured I should be prepared.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.240
-Well, I don't wanna keep you.
-No, it's okay.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.040
[Hayley and Leo coughing]

16:15.480 --> 16:18.640
What is that smell?
It smells like something's burning.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.240
[Leo] I don't know.

16:22.920 --> 16:24.520
Oh, God, Cruz. We're in trouble.

16:25.720 --> 16:28.440
-[both continue coughing]
-We gotta get out of here.

16:29.000 --> 16:29.920
Come on. Go!

16:31.840 --> 16:33.160
Come on, Brooke!

16:34.240 --> 16:36.000
[Carter] Honey, let's go.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.280
Oh, my gosh, go. I'm totally fine here.

16:40.360 --> 16:43.360
-Okay. I'm sorry I wasn't more help.
-No, no, you were great.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.360
-[Ryan] You all right, Brooke?
-Uh, yep!

16:55.440 --> 16:57.640
Just moving my brother's bed.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.160
[Ryan] Bye.

17:04.800 --> 17:05.960
[Leo] Come on, come on!

17:06.040 --> 17:07.800
[Hayley panting]

17:11.839 --> 17:14.560
-What? What?
-[Hayley panting]

17:14.640 --> 17:16.839
-What is it?
-[Hayley continues panting]

17:21.200 --> 17:22.960
I think I stepped on
the trigger for the...

17:23.040 --> 17:24.000
Explosives.

17:25.160 --> 17:26.400
If I move my foot...

17:27.280 --> 17:28.400
This whole place goes.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.520
[panting]

17:38.680 --> 17:39.760
[exhales sharply]

17:44.960 --> 17:46.960
I'm sorry, Coach. I gotta go.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.320
[both coughing]

17:59.200 --> 18:01.880
-What?
-Brooke thinks we're out.

18:01.960 --> 18:03.280
[sighs]

18:03.360 --> 18:04.560
[both continue coughing]

18:07.240 --> 18:09.120
Hang on, okay?
We're gonna get you out of here.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.840
-I'm so sorry, Cruz.
-For what?

18:12.680 --> 18:15.640
For dragging you into my mess,
for bringing you here...

18:16.560 --> 18:17.880
for everything.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.480
[chuckles softly] That's what
I love about you, Woods.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.080
You make life so interesting.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.360
Where's Hayley? Why isn't she here?

18:34.440 --> 18:36.800
-She went to the cave with Leo.
-What?

18:36.880 --> 18:39.440
They should be out by now,
but they're not answering their Louies.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.880
-Well, then open the door again.
-Okay.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.640
[both continue coughing]

18:46.240 --> 18:47.760
[breathing heavily]

18:47.840 --> 18:49.840
Do you think we should go down there?

18:50.920 --> 18:53.480
I will. Well, you stay here,
just in case they come back.

18:53.560 --> 18:54.560
[metal clanking]

18:54.640 --> 18:57.120
Whoa! Whoa! What the hell?

18:58.160 --> 18:59.000
-Hey!
-Hello?

19:00.120 --> 19:01.600
-Stupid!
-Hello?

19:01.680 --> 19:03.280
[banging on door]

19:03.360 --> 19:05.680
[Daniel] Hey! Hey!

19:05.760 --> 19:08.400
Hello? Hello?

19:08.960 --> 19:10.840
-Go, Cruz.
-I'm not going without you.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.520
Go. I'll run after you.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.960
-What about the bombs?
-I'm fast. I'm an Eagle, remember?

19:15.720 --> 19:18.760
Go! Go. She's gonna close that door soon,
and I can barely breathe.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.600
Please! Go! Please!

19:20.680 --> 19:22.000
Yeah, but you come right after me, okay?

19:22.080 --> 19:23.760
-Right after--
-Go! Go!

19:26.000 --> 19:27.800
[breathing heavily]

19:31.560 --> 19:33.840
[coughs] Come on, Woods!

19:33.920 --> 19:35.400
[breathing heavily]

19:37.000 --> 19:37.840
-[Hayley grunts]
-[beeps]

20:06.080 --> 20:07.200
[weakly] Hayley...

20:07.840 --> 20:09.840
["Oblivion" playing]
