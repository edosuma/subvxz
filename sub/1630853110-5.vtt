WEBVTT

00:11.094 --> 00:12.346
Sunja?

00:14.848 --> 00:16.140
Sunja?

00:25.275 --> 00:26.401
(in Korean) Sunja?

00:30.447 --> 00:31.573
We're here.

00:55.264 --> 00:57.641
I know it's been a difficult journey,

00:57.724 --> 00:59.309
but we'll be at my brother's soon.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.027
Isak!

01:09.111 --> 01:10.237
Brother!

01:12.823 --> 01:13.824
Yoseb!

01:21.498 --> 01:23.709
How did you get so tall?

01:23.792 --> 01:26.044
You were just a runt when I left.

01:26.128 --> 01:29.298
You stole those inches from me!

01:29.381 --> 01:31.049
I prayed very hard for it.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.635
Brother,

01:34.178 --> 01:36.513
this is my wife, Sunja.

01:42.603 --> 01:47.065
I admit, Kyunghee and I were surprised
by the news.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.692
And already with a child.

01:49.193 --> 01:50.402
We have been blessed.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.154
That is how we see it.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.408
How are you feeling?

01:56.491 --> 01:58.577
I'm relieved to be on land again,

02:00.245 --> 02:02.289
and grateful to be welcomed
into your home--

02:02.372 --> 02:04.833
No need. We are family now.

02:05.417 --> 02:06.418
But we should go.

02:06.502 --> 02:09.588
If I don't get you home soon,
Kyunghee will be furious with me.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.300
No.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.260
I'll carry them.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.763
Let's go.

03:07.980 --> 03:11.024
Wow, look at this place!

03:13.944 --> 03:15.237
There's our car coming.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.188
Are you still with the factory?

03:49.271 --> 03:51.398
Better to speak Japanese in public.

03:52.024 --> 03:54.234
(in Japanese) I'm the foreman
at the biscuit factory now.

03:54.318 --> 03:56.445
My boss trusts me.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.072
Hey, look at that!

03:59.656 --> 04:01.241
They're building a subway now.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.828
Tokyo just opened its first line
a few years ago,

04:04.912 --> 04:07.497
so Osaka will have the second one
in all of Asia.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.542
It'll change everything.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.838
But it feels like
we've already leaped into the future.

04:24.223 --> 04:25.557
Look at that!

04:26.517 --> 04:29.603
I was only seven, but I could catch
bigger abalones than these.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.233
And look how expensive!

04:34.316 --> 04:38.362
My father would come
to watch me dive for them.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.411
I'll take two.

04:46.495 --> 04:47.829
Not for me.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.831
Who said I was giving you one?

04:51.959 --> 04:55.671
I'm not even hungry
after that breakfast buffet at the hotel,

04:55.754 --> 04:57.172
but how can I resist?

04:57.256 --> 04:58.799
Of course I have to eat this.

04:59.299 --> 05:03.971
Mother, I told you the buffet is included
in the room charge.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.056
It's called sunk cost.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.934
Only people who grew up rich
think stupid things like that.

05:12.896 --> 05:16.149
Come now. Let's spread your aunt's ashes.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.151
Mother!

05:29.872 --> 05:31.123
Keep up now!

05:31.748 --> 05:33.083
Stay right behind me!

05:42.676 --> 05:44.052
Yoseb,

05:44.678 --> 05:46.096
what is this place?

05:47.556 --> 05:48.974
This is Ikaino,

05:49.600 --> 05:51.185
our neighborhood.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.982
Listen carefully, Isak.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.318
There are still spies around.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.069
Even in the church, I imagine.

06:01.612 --> 06:04.948
You can't ever let your guard down,
understand?

06:06.533 --> 06:09.828
Look what I'm doing,
scaring you on your first night.

06:12.497 --> 06:17.628
You can't imagine
how dire that first year was for us here.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.507
Look around, and you can see why.

06:22.966 --> 06:26.220
Bellies are hungry, but there's no work.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.305
They are desperate.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.100
And do you know how many times
our house has been broken into?

06:32.184 --> 06:35.646
When we go to the police,
they do nothing.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.482
They don't care about the Koreans here.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.945
But I suppose
when you consider everything,

06:43.946 --> 06:46.073
we're still the fortunate ones.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.498
Scram! Go now!

06:54.581 --> 06:57.251
I told you not to let your pigs
run around like this!

07:00.587 --> 07:02.047
Shit!

07:06.718 --> 07:07.803
We're home!

07:09.847 --> 07:11.098
Kyunghee!

07:11.181 --> 07:16.019
Following the First Sino-Japanese
and Russo-Japanese War,

07:16.103 --> 07:19.106
Manchuria and Mongolia
have become a lifeline for our country…

07:25.904 --> 07:27.614
Isak!

07:27.698 --> 07:29.241
Look at you.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.827
But you haven't changed at all.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.037
Not changed?

07:34.121 --> 07:35.622
I'm an old lady now.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.671
It's Sunja, isn't it?

07:43.172 --> 07:45.424
You must be tired after the long journey.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.676
How are you feeling?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.095
I'm fine.

07:50.179 --> 07:52.389
Please do not concern yourself.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.309
But you're hungry, right?

07:55.392 --> 07:56.643
Sit.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.237
Today, you just eat.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.282
I got a special treat
to mark this occasion.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.383
You came!

10:35.219 --> 10:38.263
I see that look.
Guess you already heard?

10:38.347 --> 10:40.057
Just happy you're here.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.142
Let me introduce my fiancée.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.771
Meet Solomon, my classmate
from the international school.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.981
Ah! The one who conquered America.

10:48.065 --> 10:49.691
How do you find Tokyo
after all this time?

10:49.775 --> 10:53.695
A city with too much money
but no time to spend it.

10:53.779 --> 10:54.780
The best.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.449
See? He always charmed the girls.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.370
So it was a mystery
why he was always stuck on that one girl.

11:01.453 --> 11:02.829
The intense one--

11:02.913 --> 11:04.581
-Hana.
-Yes, Hana.

11:04.665 --> 11:05.874
Whatever happened to her?

11:06.834 --> 11:09.211
She disappeared.

11:09.294 --> 11:12.089
If that's the kind of girl you want,
you know where to find them.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.924
Kumiko's alone again.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.135
I told you not to invite her.

11:17.219 --> 11:18.929
She just wants your attention.

11:22.224 --> 11:23.684
Her older sister,

11:23.767 --> 11:25.936
she's the reason
we had to delay our engagement party.

11:26.019 --> 11:30.065
Her parents wanted
to marry her off first, but no takers.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.403
So, what's the situation?

11:35.612 --> 11:38.574
Abe-san is blackballing you
from every bank in Tokyo.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.661
Who cares?
I'm going back to New York anyway.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.538
You sure about that?

11:44.621 --> 11:45.789
What do you know?

11:46.957 --> 11:49.459
No, it's nothing.

11:50.711 --> 11:53.088
But Tom Andrews,

11:53.922 --> 11:55.924
I wouldn't put too much faith in him.

11:56.008 --> 11:59.011
He's busy atoning for his own sins.

11:59.094 --> 12:02.139
Financial irregularities,
clients' assets.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.975
No way. He's not the type.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.686
Could be why New York shipped him
off to Tokyo.

12:08.270 --> 12:09.730
To hush things up.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.232
Whatever happened,

12:12.316 --> 12:14.610
he can't afford
to damage his career any more.

12:14.693 --> 12:17.613
So you think he'll cut me loose?

12:17.696 --> 12:19.198
Well, wouldn't you?

12:20.365 --> 12:23.535
I'll do my best
to defend your reputation.

12:24.494 --> 12:28.123
But really, I don't get why
you would do such a thing.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.336
Neither do I.

12:35.506 --> 12:39.092
I need to greet the other guests,
but I'll see you in a bit.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.470
Hey,

12:41.553 --> 12:43.514
what did you mean before,

12:43.597 --> 12:45.474
when you said
I should know where to find Hana?

12:46.350 --> 12:47.684
Where should I look?

12:48.435 --> 12:49.645
For that sort of thing,

12:50.229 --> 12:51.522
I would guess the Yoshiwara area,

12:51.605 --> 12:52.981
by the Uguisudani stop.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.239
Hi.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.223
What was he thinking?

13:26.974 --> 13:28.517
Lower your voice.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.020
How could he marry a girl like that?

13:35.107 --> 13:36.525
She's still young.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.695
Let her settle in.

13:41.321 --> 13:45.158
Were we any older when we came?
We were the same age.

13:47.578 --> 13:51.832
And we were miserable then.
Don't you remember?

13:55.586 --> 13:57.546
I'm not just talking about that.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.967
She's further along than I expected.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.845
You see that as well, don't you?

14:08.056 --> 14:11.894
And Isak,
he's susceptible to idealistic leanings.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.104
A girl like that…

14:15.439 --> 14:17.649
she might have planned to trap him.

14:18.775 --> 14:19.776
Yoseb.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.904
We've taken in someone
we know nothing about.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.072
Doesn't that worry you?

14:33.916 --> 14:36.001
It seems I disappoint them.

14:48.555 --> 14:52.267
They'll come around. Don't worry.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.901
But this place…

15:03.237 --> 15:05.989
I feel like it wants no part of us.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.664
I feel that as well.

15:19.378 --> 15:20.754
For so long now,

15:20.838 --> 15:22.506
I've wanted to leave home.

15:24.299 --> 15:25.884
Now that I've done it…

15:29.346 --> 15:33.016
Sunja, I worry you'll come to resent me.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.269
Resent you?

15:37.271 --> 15:40.023
How could I resent the one who saved me?

15:40.107 --> 15:42.442
I don't want this debt between us.

15:43.569 --> 15:45.320
You owe me nothing.

15:48.073 --> 15:49.658
You said it yourself.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.829
My prospects were bleak.

15:53.912 --> 15:56.039
But you were not afraid to meet them.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.916
You're wrong.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.334
I was terrified.

16:03.881 --> 16:05.424
You really don't see it,

16:07.217 --> 16:08.260
do you?

16:16.351 --> 16:20.105
You have so much fortitude.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.653
So much that I can siphon off
my own dose of courage

16:28.197 --> 16:29.990
and still leave you with a bounty.

16:36.747 --> 16:38.415
And this child…

16:40.751 --> 16:42.669
the one I will give my name to,

16:44.171 --> 16:45.756
he will save me.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.303
Death cannot have me.

16:53.931 --> 16:59.311
So no matter what my brother
or sister-in-law believe, they are wrong.

17:00.938 --> 17:03.524
I am the one
who must not be a burden to you.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.197
You're nervous as well.

18:54.510 --> 18:56.803
You know, I saw you that day,

18:57.346 --> 18:59.306
dancing in the plaza.

19:01.433 --> 19:02.726
You were there?

19:06.688 --> 19:08.857
Where did that come from?

19:09.441 --> 19:11.026
Who knows.

19:13.737 --> 19:15.906
When I left that conference room,

19:16.740 --> 19:19.201
I really wanted to sink into that ground.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.955
But when I got outside
and I heard that music…

19:23.789 --> 19:25.415
It's hard to describe.

19:27.084 --> 19:29.711
I really felt I could fly away.

19:31.713 --> 19:33.465
I was on top of the world.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.051
But you didn't fly away.

19:36.969 --> 19:38.971
I guess gravity won.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.144
Perhaps there was another reason?

19:47.229 --> 19:49.439
Perhaps Hana?

19:51.942 --> 19:53.527
The office walls are thin.

19:54.069 --> 19:57.072
You heard all that?

19:58.156 --> 19:59.449
I'm sorry.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.660
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

20:04.496 --> 20:06.415
But I must confess,

20:08.250 --> 20:09.960
I was curious.

20:12.838 --> 20:14.423
She must mean a lot to you.

20:16.967 --> 20:19.011
She did,

20:20.596 --> 20:22.139
but I haven't seen her in years.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.560
Honestly,
I was starting to forget about her.

20:28.979 --> 20:31.607
But then she called after all this time.

20:33.275 --> 20:36.486
It wouldn't affect you so much
if something wasn't still there.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.117
From the first time we met,

20:42.201 --> 20:44.119
she's been stuck in my heart.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.374
I was 14.

20:51.543 --> 20:53.504
She was the daughter
of my father's girlfriend.

20:54.171 --> 20:56.381
Strange circumstances, I know.

20:56.465 --> 21:00.135
But maybe that was part of the appeal.

21:03.055 --> 21:04.389
Some people just have…

21:06.225 --> 21:10.395
that power to consume you.

21:14.233 --> 21:15.734
Hana had that power.

21:18.612 --> 21:20.072
Why did the two of you split?

21:21.573 --> 21:23.158
I left for America.

21:24.493 --> 21:25.911
Not too long after that…

21:28.789 --> 21:30.457
she ran away from home.

21:32.584 --> 21:34.127
You can try to find her.

21:35.587 --> 21:38.882
I'm not sure I want to do that.

21:40.425 --> 21:43.262
I don't think she's going to like
who I've become.

21:45.305 --> 21:48.100
Well, Baek-san,
you like complicated women.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.520
Like that landowner.

21:52.688 --> 21:54.606
Why bring that up?

21:55.190 --> 21:59.152
No amount of money
was going to make her sell.

22:02.656 --> 22:05.033
Then do you think
that was her plan all along?

22:06.577 --> 22:07.661
What plan?

22:08.745 --> 22:10.539
To humiliate you.

22:12.541 --> 22:14.710
When you think about it, it's obvious.

22:25.888 --> 22:27.973
Naomi-san, it really is unfortunate

22:28.056 --> 22:30.017
to be born a woman,

22:31.351 --> 22:32.769
especially in this country.

22:34.730 --> 22:38.901
Being married to a job
that doesn't even want you…

22:40.986 --> 22:45.741
is that what you call winning?

22:54.166 --> 22:56.293
Baek-san, it will be interesting

22:57.377 --> 22:58.795
to see what your future holds.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.378
I'm sorry.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.255
I slept in again.

23:41.338 --> 23:44.216
If the baby is to grow strong,
the mother needs her sleep.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.261
Please, let me hang the wash.

23:52.391 --> 23:53.684
Slowly.

23:53.767 --> 23:55.644
Don't strain yourself.

23:59.481 --> 24:02.067
I didn't even hear Isak leave
this morning.

24:02.985 --> 24:05.153
He's getting up earlier and earlier.

24:05.737 --> 24:07.781
The work at the church
seems to suit him.

24:25.841 --> 24:26.884
What is it?

24:26.967 --> 24:28.051
Are you in pain?

24:31.680 --> 24:37.227
The smell… you washed it all away.

24:41.607 --> 24:44.568
It's been a few weeks,
and they were smelling so terribly.

24:44.651 --> 24:47.279
Oh, I didn't realize…

24:48.071 --> 24:51.116
It's all I had left.

24:54.494 --> 24:57.372
Just a little while…

24:58.999 --> 25:01.293
I just needed it
for a little while longer.

25:03.629 --> 25:05.422
Oh, Sunja.

25:07.883 --> 25:10.052
When does it go away?

25:12.763 --> 25:14.389
This ache,

25:16.266 --> 25:19.645
when does it stop?

25:25.359 --> 25:27.528
It doesn't.

25:33.033 --> 25:35.494
But you'll learn to endure it.

25:38.121 --> 25:39.164
Trust me.

26:42.352 --> 26:43.979
You're sure this is it?

26:45.939 --> 26:47.983
This is where your father is buried?

26:48.066 --> 26:49.526
What are you saying?

26:49.610 --> 26:51.904
How can I forget
where I buried my father?

26:53.488 --> 26:54.740
This is the right place.

26:55.741 --> 26:59.745
Then they moved his grave
when they built this parking lot.

27:04.166 --> 27:05.292
Mother,

27:05.375 --> 27:08.003
they would have done it right.

27:08.086 --> 27:10.047
Don't worry. We'll find it.

27:13.258 --> 27:14.301
I'm sorry.

27:14.384 --> 27:16.094
I know nothing of this.

27:17.012 --> 27:19.681
You'll have to speak to my husband.
He's not in.

27:21.433 --> 27:23.519
We've already spoken with your husband.

27:24.978 --> 27:27.314
But since he doesn't have the money,

27:27.397 --> 27:30.359
it's up to his family then
to pay off the 160-yen debt.

27:32.361 --> 27:34.071
That seal,

27:34.154 --> 27:35.948
it's your husband's, is it not?

27:39.451 --> 27:40.619
It is.

27:42.246 --> 27:44.790
We don't want to be a hassle for you.

27:46.375 --> 27:48.168
Give us a 20 if you have it.

27:49.086 --> 27:50.546
Our boss,

27:50.629 --> 27:53.131
he'll be satisfied with that
for the week.

27:55.092 --> 27:56.176
The 160 yen,

27:57.094 --> 27:58.470
that's the entire amount?

27:58.554 --> 27:59.555
I'll handle this.

27:59.638 --> 28:02.808
Including the interest, it's now double.

28:09.314 --> 28:10.983
When was the loan taken out?

28:12.609 --> 28:13.861
Two months ago.

28:13.944 --> 28:16.113
Said his brother just got married.
Needed an extra fare over.

28:20.617 --> 28:22.494
We'll have the money in a few hours.

28:22.578 --> 28:25.247
-Who do we bring it to?
-You don't seem to understand--

28:25.330 --> 28:28.709
No need to waste your breath.
Just tell me where to bring the money.

28:28.792 --> 28:29.793
Over by the docks,

28:29.877 --> 28:32.129
there's an office
above the net repair shop.

28:32.880 --> 28:35.048
So you'll have the 20 yen then?

28:35.132 --> 28:36.758
We can let our boss know?

28:36.842 --> 28:38.677
Tell him he'll get the entire amount.

28:51.190 --> 28:52.316
But Sunja…

28:53.901 --> 28:55.736
Where did you get a watch like this?

28:58.822 --> 29:00.824
My mother gave it to me.

29:01.408 --> 29:03.410
She wanted me to have something
for emergencies.

29:05.204 --> 29:07.915
Kyunghee, it must be paid right away.

29:09.541 --> 29:11.001
We should trust Yoseb to handle this.

29:11.084 --> 29:12.920
I'm sure he tried his best,

29:14.421 --> 29:18.300
but the payments are too cumbersome now.

29:18.383 --> 29:20.427
I've seen this happen many times.

29:21.094 --> 29:26.183
Back home, so many farmers had to turn
to moneylenders after a bad season

29:26.266 --> 29:27.851
to buy more seeds or equipment.

29:27.935 --> 29:29.269
Many even lost their homes.

29:29.353 --> 29:31.146
How could he do this?

29:31.230 --> 29:33.565
To go to such people.

29:34.399 --> 29:37.361
Was there any choice?

29:41.448 --> 29:43.283
This is my debt.

29:44.910 --> 29:47.454
I'm the one who must pay it.

29:49.456 --> 29:55.087
Can you at least assure me
that his grave was moved properly,

29:55.170 --> 29:58.090
that he is safe somewhere?

29:59.299 --> 30:00.759
I understand your concerns,

30:00.843 --> 30:03.011
but without the file,
I really don't know anything.

30:04.721 --> 30:07.766
Let's start by processing
the request for the report.

30:08.475 --> 30:09.768
Your name?

30:10.477 --> 30:14.773
Kim Sunja.
My Japanese name is Bando Nobuko.

30:15.774 --> 30:17.359
You're one of those.

30:17.901 --> 30:20.028
When did you move over?

30:20.571 --> 30:22.364
1931.

30:22.447 --> 30:25.367
Do you have Japanese citizenship then?

30:27.327 --> 30:28.704
No.

30:28.787 --> 30:31.999
-I'm a permanent resident.
-But you carry a South Korean passport.

30:32.082 --> 30:34.126
All we want is
to find my grandfather's grave--

30:59.484 --> 31:00.777
Mother?

31:03.989 --> 31:05.157
Mother,

31:05.866 --> 31:06.867
calm yourself.

31:06.950 --> 31:08.327
They'll find the location.

31:08.410 --> 31:10.579
How can you say that?

31:10.662 --> 31:12.372
So much has changed here.

31:12.456 --> 31:14.374
It's impossible to find the living,

31:14.458 --> 31:16.627
let alone the dead.

31:17.252 --> 31:18.420
Excuse me!

31:19.838 --> 31:22.132
I found a note
while looking through our files

31:22.216 --> 31:24.343
related to relocation requests.

31:24.426 --> 31:26.220
Perhaps you know the name

31:26.303 --> 31:27.971
Shin Bokhee?

32:45.174 --> 32:47.259
Do you know this person?

32:47.885 --> 32:49.678
She's my older sister.

32:49.761 --> 32:52.097
We've been looking for her for years.

32:53.056 --> 32:55.809
She'd be 29 now.

32:57.186 --> 32:58.854
Someone shows up here once a week

32:58.937 --> 33:00.439
with the same story.

33:01.481 --> 33:02.816
It's not a lie.

33:04.151 --> 33:06.195
That's what they all say.

33:06.278 --> 33:07.988
In any case,

33:08.071 --> 33:09.990
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

33:18.207 --> 33:19.208
Haruki-san?

33:25.756 --> 33:27.007
Solomon?

33:42.981 --> 33:44.566
I'll be right there!

33:48.403 --> 33:49.947
What is it?

33:50.030 --> 33:52.157
What do you want to sell me today?

33:54.868 --> 33:56.703
Have I really changed that much?

33:56.787 --> 33:58.830
I suppose I must have.

34:04.127 --> 34:05.921
Sunja?

34:08.382 --> 34:11.092
Sunja, is that really you?

34:11.176 --> 34:12.844
Sister! It's me.

34:12.928 --> 34:15.054
Bokhee, my sister!

34:15.138 --> 34:16.681
You came back.

34:23.063 --> 34:25.274
It's certainly a fine piece.

34:26.733 --> 34:28.652
But I'm sorry to say

34:29.527 --> 34:32.239
there isn't demand for something
like this in this neighborhood.

34:33.364 --> 34:36.659
Young men these days,
they like the ones you wear on the wrist.

34:37.995 --> 34:39.705
I can give you 40 for it.

34:43.625 --> 34:46.378
I'm sorry for bothering you. Good day.

34:46.962 --> 34:49.547
I'd like to help you,
especially since you are expecting.

34:49.630 --> 34:51.967
I'd be willing to go up to 50,

34:53.051 --> 34:56.388
though I'm not sure I can earn it back.

34:56.471 --> 34:58.473
It's worth at least 300.

34:59.057 --> 35:00.601
It's from Switzerland.

35:00.684 --> 35:02.728
They make the best watches there.

35:02.811 --> 35:05.480
You're not in Switzerland, are you?

35:09.026 --> 35:10.694
I understand.

35:10.777 --> 35:12.279
Goodbye.

35:14.239 --> 35:15.908
You're from Busan.

35:17.242 --> 35:19.494
I can tell from your accent.

35:20.829 --> 35:22.956
Your parents,
what do they do over there?

35:23.498 --> 35:25.125
Just my mother.

35:25.209 --> 35:26.835
She runs her own boardinghouse.

35:27.711 --> 35:30.172
Must be a clever businesswoman.

35:31.340 --> 35:32.799
Fine.

35:34.218 --> 35:35.636
225 yen.

35:35.719 --> 35:36.762
Three hundred.

35:37.596 --> 35:38.972
That is my price.

36:11.421 --> 36:13.882
Kyunghee, what is it?

36:15.217 --> 36:17.219
We can't go there.

36:17.302 --> 36:18.971
It wouldn't be respectable.

36:19.054 --> 36:21.348
But the loan isn't paid
until we deliver this money.

36:22.891 --> 36:25.143
Can't we just give it to Yoseb?

36:26.520 --> 36:29.481
This kind of dirty work belongs to men,
not us.

36:31.108 --> 36:33.652
Do you really think
he would take this money from me?

36:41.201 --> 36:44.788
I'll go. Wait for me at home.

36:48.208 --> 36:49.459
No, you can't go!

36:53.046 --> 36:54.214
If I don't,

36:54.923 --> 36:56.175
what happens then?

37:02.055 --> 37:03.807
You don't realize…

37:05.809 --> 37:08.145
before I came here,

37:08.228 --> 37:10.480
I never even cooked
or washed my own clothes.

37:12.941 --> 37:16.028
I never spoke to anyone
who my parents didn't know.

37:17.321 --> 37:19.281
Never even handled my own money.

37:21.533 --> 37:24.244
Learning how to do everything,

37:24.328 --> 37:26.538
it was so hard, Sunja.

37:28.207 --> 37:29.750
But then I see you.

37:31.376 --> 37:33.795
You've only been here a few weeks.

37:36.089 --> 37:37.382
I feel foolish.

37:42.721 --> 37:44.681
This morning, you asked me

37:44.765 --> 37:46.642
when the ache will go away.

37:49.144 --> 37:53.732
The truth is,
I'm scared all the time here.

37:56.193 --> 37:57.861
This constant fear…

38:01.698 --> 38:04.159
how much longer
do I have to live with it?

38:13.752 --> 38:17.548
Let's be scared together.

38:19.383 --> 38:21.844
Perhaps some strength
can come out of it.

38:24.555 --> 38:25.639
Do you think so?

38:27.015 --> 38:28.267
I do.

38:47.494 --> 38:48.829
Move out of the way.

38:55.878 --> 38:57.171
Eat.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.439
After you left…

39:18.233 --> 39:21.111
it felt like
a huge hole opened in our lives.

39:23.197 --> 39:27.367
Your mother, especially,
she felt it deeply.

39:29.870 --> 39:33.874
It was hard for Donghee and me

39:33.957 --> 39:37.711
to see her like that.

39:41.215 --> 39:47.304
Then the war broke out,
and things got even harder.

39:52.059 --> 39:55.729
We were a burden to your mother.
We knew that.

39:58.690 --> 39:59.816
But even then,

39:59.900 --> 40:01.401
she refused to send us away.

40:05.614 --> 40:11.203
Then, one day,
Donghee and I were approached by a man…

40:13.247 --> 40:19.336
who promised us decent factory jobs
in Manchuria.

40:21.839 --> 40:26.969
We hated the thought
of leaving your mother alone here…

40:29.596 --> 40:35.978
but how much longer
would she have been able to keep us?

40:36.687 --> 40:39.439
Besides, your leaving,

40:40.107 --> 40:45.571
it made us realize
just how small our lives were here.

40:47.239 --> 40:49.992
Donghee, especially,

40:50.534 --> 40:52.870
she really wanted to see the world.

40:58.166 --> 41:01.253
We came back after the war,

41:02.421 --> 41:04.339
and we found your mother gone.

41:05.299 --> 41:07.134
The truth is,

41:07.217 --> 41:08.886
I was glad.

41:10.929 --> 41:13.390
I didn't want her to see

41:13.473 --> 41:14.975
how much we had changed.

41:19.771 --> 41:24.776
Even though there was so little
to come back to, I was glad to be back.

41:27.487 --> 41:29.573
But for Donghee,

41:29.656 --> 41:31.658
that happiness faded quickly…

41:36.496 --> 41:39.416
when she realized it wasn't possible…

41:41.710 --> 41:44.004
to fit back into the shape
of the young girl

41:45.631 --> 41:47.633
she once was.

41:53.430 --> 41:55.432
Remember where we used to do laundry?

41:58.143 --> 41:59.228
That's…

42:02.439 --> 42:03.649
where I found her.

42:20.415 --> 42:23.335
You realize that some people

42:23.877 --> 42:28.757
live in their dreams.

42:31.260 --> 42:35.597
They're not made
to endure in such times.

43:02.541 --> 43:04.960
This is where you live?

43:25.189 --> 43:26.815
I just ran into him.

43:28.150 --> 43:30.027
This is Solomon.

43:30.110 --> 43:32.070
I've known him since he was a baby.

43:33.197 --> 43:34.781
Please welcome him.

43:35.866 --> 43:36.992
That's Noriko.

43:38.869 --> 43:40.078
Her brother, Takashi.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.541
Masako.

43:44.625 --> 43:46.543
Such a handsome young man.

43:46.627 --> 43:48.754
Is he a gift for me?

43:49.630 --> 43:52.508
He's a little old for you,
don't you think?

43:52.591 --> 43:55.552
You're right,
but I could make an exception

43:55.636 --> 43:57.221
for such a good-looking guy.

43:59.473 --> 44:00.474
And this,

44:01.725 --> 44:03.519
this is Satoru.

44:06.271 --> 44:08.524
This is Mozasu's son.

44:15.906 --> 44:18.450
I still speak often of your father.

44:19.576 --> 44:22.913
He was my greatest friend,
and he saved my life once.

44:24.414 --> 44:26.375
But that's all a long time ago.

44:28.293 --> 44:31.380
This is my home now.

44:50.607 --> 44:52.192
Get me the promissory note.

45:30.355 --> 45:32.232
I'm fine. Please serve yourselves.

45:32.816 --> 45:34.985
You are our guest.

45:35.861 --> 45:37.029
Thank you.

45:38.030 --> 45:39.448
This is delicious.

45:39.948 --> 45:41.533
What's in it?

45:44.661 --> 45:45.996
Just eat your fill.

45:58.675 --> 46:01.136
If it weren't for Bokhee…

46:03.180 --> 46:09.061
my father would be just one of many
in a crowded, unmarked grave.

46:10.604 --> 46:14.900
I don't know
how I can ever repay her kindness.

46:18.070 --> 46:21.990
She did it for you.

46:29.915 --> 46:33.043
In the end,

46:33.126 --> 46:34.753
I was the lucky one.

46:38.632 --> 46:39.842
But…

46:41.885 --> 46:44.805
in my heart, it doesn't feel right.

46:46.640 --> 46:49.184
It is not a shame to survive, mother.

46:56.441 --> 47:00.612
A long time ago, someone once told me,

47:01.405 --> 47:04.950
"For every step forward,

47:05.868 --> 47:08.996
another person would have to fall back."

47:10.622 --> 47:12.833
I couldn't believe that then.

47:15.627 --> 47:17.588
But now I wonder…

47:19.548 --> 47:22.509
perhaps he was right.

47:28.056 --> 47:32.227
I don't know
who would've said such a thing to you,

47:33.937 --> 47:37.399
but it doesn't sound right to me.

47:46.700 --> 47:47.701
Hey,

47:49.494 --> 47:51.330
let's go home.

47:51.413 --> 47:52.414
Really?

47:53.207 --> 47:55.417
But we still have two more days here.

47:57.836 --> 47:59.546
I can come back.

48:01.840 --> 48:03.967
I know that now.

48:25.197 --> 48:27.282
When you disappeared,
my father mourned for you,

48:27.991 --> 48:32.246
as did your wife and brother.

48:35.415 --> 48:38.752
I know I hurt many people.

48:38.836 --> 48:41.004
I didn't mean it like that.

48:41.880 --> 48:43.507
It's only to say

48:44.091 --> 48:46.718
how much you were loved.

48:47.636 --> 48:49.555
That is true…

48:51.390 --> 48:52.766
but…

48:53.475 --> 48:56.144
the Haruki they loved
was a different man.

48:57.437 --> 48:59.523
The person I am now couldn't exist then.

49:01.191 --> 49:06.947
I may not have much here,
but I can be myself.

49:13.912 --> 49:15.455
Please.

49:26.550 --> 49:27.634
I'm sorry.

49:30.804 --> 49:32.389
What am I doing?

49:39.605 --> 49:42.357
I always felt sorry for you.

49:44.109 --> 49:45.694
You grew up

49:45.777 --> 49:47.863
burdened with your family's hopes
and dreams.

49:47.946 --> 49:50.073
It must have been impossible.

49:52.075 --> 49:53.827
But then,

49:54.536 --> 49:57.247
to feel bad for someone who has so much,

49:58.040 --> 50:00.167
that feels wrong somehow.

50:03.921 --> 50:08.008
I just hope we can both be happy.

50:50.884 --> 50:51.969
Sunja…

50:54.263 --> 50:56.265
did we do the wrong thing?

51:04.690 --> 51:07.359
Respectfully, may I ask

51:07.442 --> 51:11.864
how did you know
she would come to sell the watch?

51:16.994 --> 51:18.579
She married a dreamer.

51:21.081 --> 51:25.210
A man weaker than her.
And for that, she'll pay dearly.

51:28.922 --> 51:31.049
310 yen, for your troubles.

51:52.196 --> 51:58.243
FOR SALE
BY KUROHANA ENTERPRISES

52:10.631 --> 52:13.050
Tom, listen, I know you're pissed at me,

52:13.133 --> 52:15.260
but I think there's something at play
with Mamoru Yoshii.

52:15.344 --> 52:17.638
I've been hearing
he's selling off a lot of property.

52:17.721 --> 52:19.681
Hey, I'm glad you called.

52:19.765 --> 52:21.892
-I've been meaning to get in touch.
-Why?

52:22.392 --> 52:24.478
Shiffley's is letting you go. Okay?

52:24.561 --> 52:27.147
They're getting too much heat
from Colton and Abe-san.

52:27.231 --> 52:28.690
You can't let them do this.

52:29.274 --> 52:31.944
Believe it or not, I tried to help you.

52:32.027 --> 52:34.571
T-Tom, my visa.
It's sponsored by Shiffley's.

52:34.655 --> 52:36.448
That means I can't go back.

52:37.491 --> 52:39.743
Well, you should contact a lawyer
right away, man.

52:39.826 --> 52:41.954
I don't know if there's anything
they can do, but they--

52:42.037 --> 52:43.705
I have to get the other line.
Don't hang up.

52:44.790 --> 52:46.083
Hello, what is it?

52:46.166 --> 52:50.128
Solomon, I don't want to die alone.

52:50.212 --> 52:51.380
I don't!

52:51.463 --> 52:52.840
Hana,

52:52.923 --> 52:54.049
what happened?

52:57.010 --> 52:58.095
Hana!

52:58.178 --> 52:59.429
You need to come!

53:01.181 --> 53:02.766
Come now…

53:05.185 --> 53:06.812
before it's too late.
