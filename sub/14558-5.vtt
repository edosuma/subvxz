WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:04.405
(male vocalizing over
funky rock intro)

00:05.906 --> 00:08.709
* Yeah! Mmm, it was...

00:08.776 --> 00:12.012
(vocalizing continues)

00:12.080 --> 00:15.149
* I can be loud, man,
I can be silent *

00:15.216 --> 00:18.252
* I could be young, man,
or I could be old *

00:18.319 --> 00:21.455
* I can be a gentleman,
I can be violent *

00:21.522 --> 00:24.458
* I could turn hot, man,
or I could be cold *

00:24.525 --> 00:28.062
* I could be just like
the calm before the storm... *

00:28.129 --> 00:29.497
BOY:
That was a weird movie.

00:29.563 --> 00:30.698
Yeah, from the reviews,
I thought

00:30.764 --> 00:32.066
it was gonna be more
of a comedy, huh?

00:32.133 --> 00:33.667
I thought it was pretty good.

00:33.734 --> 00:34.668
BOY:
Teenagers like

00:34.735 --> 00:36.104
boring movies.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.338
You only like cartoons.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.540
No. I just don't like
boring movies

00:39.607 --> 00:41.575
about people in love.
(kicks seat)

00:41.642 --> 00:42.643
(laughs)

00:42.710 --> 00:44.678
(laughter)

00:47.014 --> 00:48.182
Can we get ice cream?

00:48.249 --> 00:49.583
No, we got
to get home.

00:49.650 --> 00:50.518
Oh, come on.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.620
It's on the way. Kind of.

00:52.686 --> 00:53.954
MAN:
Actually, bud,

00:54.021 --> 00:55.055
it's-it's not at all.

00:55.123 --> 00:56.524
You know?

00:56.590 --> 00:57.691
However...

00:57.758 --> 00:58.726
You know you want to.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.262
Well, see, if you put
it like that, then...

01:01.329 --> 01:02.730
(laughing):
Dad!

01:02.796 --> 01:03.664
(laughing)

01:03.731 --> 01:04.598
(gunshot)

01:04.665 --> 01:05.933
Dad?

01:05.999 --> 01:07.668
What was that?!

01:07.735 --> 01:09.137
Take the wheel!

01:09.203 --> 01:10.704
I'm trying!

01:10.771 --> 01:11.839
Dad! Dad!

01:13.607 --> 01:15.376
Watch out,
you're gonna hit that...!

01:17.545 --> 01:18.412
Look out!

01:21.715 --> 01:23.751
(tires squealing,
horns blaring)

01:25.052 --> 01:26.320
I got it!

01:35.062 --> 01:37.431
Dad?
Dad?

01:38.566 --> 01:39.333
Dad!

01:40.868 --> 01:42.736
Lady luck.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.672
Chance.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.274
Randomness.

01:46.340 --> 01:50.978
Human beings truly have
a hard time understanding it.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.780
Raindrops fall randomly.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.015
Now, which of these two images
best represents

01:55.082 --> 01:57.618
raindrops falling on a sidewalk?

01:57.685 --> 02:00.854
Is it image A?

02:00.921 --> 02:04.124
Image B? Okay.

02:04.192 --> 02:05.859
You're wrong.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.195
Our brains

02:07.261 --> 02:10.431
misperceive evenness as random,

02:10.498 --> 02:13.734
and wrongly assume
that groupings are deliberate.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.803
Because of this,
people make all sorts

02:15.869 --> 02:17.371
of irrational decisions.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.807
Like, they-they won't work
in a high-rise building,

02:19.873 --> 02:23.143
or they're afraid to live
in an earthquake-prone area.

02:23.211 --> 02:26.013
And yet, a mathematical
assessment tells us

02:26.079 --> 02:28.349
that you are far more likely
to suffocate in bed

02:28.416 --> 02:30.318
than you are to die
in a terrorist attack.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.553
You are ten times
more likely

02:32.620 --> 02:35.789
to die from alcohol than
from being in an earthquake.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.091
And it is three times
more likely

02:38.158 --> 02:39.960
that you will be killed
while driving

02:40.027 --> 02:43.897
to buy a lottery ticket
than it is that you will...

02:43.964 --> 02:45.433
that you will win the lottery.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.467
(students laughing)

02:46.534 --> 02:50.137
WOMAN:
They said he was shot.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.206
Yeah, that's
what we think.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.241
Is there anyone

02:53.307 --> 02:55.075
who would want to
harm your husband?

02:55.142 --> 02:56.210
No. No one.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.546
I'm Don Eppes, FBI.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.448
Marla.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.351
So, do you know
who did it?

03:03.417 --> 03:06.387
Not yet, but-but
we're working on it.

03:06.454 --> 03:07.588
I heard on the news

03:07.655 --> 03:09.457
there were attacks
on the freeways.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.924
Yeah.
DAVID:
That's true.

03:10.991 --> 03:12.760
But we don't know
if those incidents are related

03:12.826 --> 03:14.762
to the, uh, the attack
on your husband at all.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.230
DON:
Right, I mean,
what we'd like to do,

03:16.297 --> 03:17.765
if we can,
is just take a...

03:17.831 --> 03:19.700
Excuse me.
Uh, Mrs. Kinkirk?

03:19.767 --> 03:20.901
Yes.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.736
Your husband's stable.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.405
Thank God.

03:24.472 --> 03:27.107
There are issues that
need to be discussed.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.008
DON:
All right.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.243
We'll give you a few minutes.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.678
We'll wait for you down here.

03:30.744 --> 03:31.712
Oh, please stay.

03:31.779 --> 03:32.546
Um...

03:32.613 --> 03:34.282
DON:
I'll take
these guys.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.350
Why don't we go
hang out there, guys?

03:36.417 --> 03:37.518
Okay. Thank you.

03:37.585 --> 03:40.654
Come on.
It's all right.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.991
Your husband sustained
a gunshot wound to his head.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.125
Luckily,

03:45.192 --> 03:46.660
the bullet did not
penetrate far.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.929
It's lodged in the
right occipital lobe.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.499
Our neurosurgeon
is confident that
he can remove it

03:51.565 --> 03:52.900
without further damage.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.935
(crying)

03:58.472 --> 04:00.674
So, can you guys tell
me anything at all

04:00.741 --> 04:02.410
that you remember
from what happened?

04:02.476 --> 04:04.545
I heard a loud crash
from the back.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.880
I turned, and
Pete was scared.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.181
From the noise.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.317
Right.

04:09.383 --> 04:10.451
And then I saw the blood.

04:10.518 --> 04:13.153
And I looked
where Pete was looking,

04:13.220 --> 04:15.055
and I saw Dad was hurt.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.189
So, what happened then?

04:16.256 --> 04:18.158
I grabbed the wheel,
and I tried

04:18.225 --> 04:19.327
to keep us
from crashing.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.261
Yeah, well, that's smart.
You know,

04:21.329 --> 04:22.430
it's good
thinking. Now,

04:22.496 --> 04:25.699
right before the shot, is there
anything that stood out?

04:25.766 --> 04:28.201
Any cars or anything
that you might remember?

04:28.268 --> 04:29.770
I don't know.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.038
I think maybe

04:31.104 --> 04:32.806
there was a white truck?

04:32.873 --> 04:33.674
Okay.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.576
I didn't see
who was driving it.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.778
Sorry, I didn't see it.

04:41.549 --> 04:44.051
Is-Is our dad going to be okay?

04:44.117 --> 04:45.085
Yeah.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.821
And, you know,
we're gonna do everything we can

04:47.888 --> 04:49.657
to find the guy.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.062
We got seven freeway attacks
in eight weeks.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.997
Four people dead.

04:59.867 --> 05:00.701
You okay?

05:00.768 --> 05:02.002
Well, you know,
I just lied to those kids.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.771
No, you made them feel
a little better, Don.

05:03.837 --> 05:04.972
It's a tough time, you know?

05:05.038 --> 05:05.773
I'm an idiot,

05:05.839 --> 05:06.807
acting like
everything's gonna be normal.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.008
Those kids need
to believe that

05:08.075 --> 05:09.410
if they're gonna
make it through.
Come on, Dave.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.345
Their lives are
never gonna be the same.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.458
COLBY:
There's no indication

05:24.525 --> 05:26.794
of enemies, financial
or marital troubles.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.929
Witness testimony and
tips came up empty.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.531
All right, so what
have we got here?

05:30.598 --> 05:31.865
We got
seven attacks

05:31.932 --> 05:32.800
in two months.

05:32.866 --> 05:33.934
What do you think,
Megan, serial?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.537
MEGAN:
Uh, if so,
it's atypical.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.005
All the MOs are different.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.408
Yeah, the previous attacks
we had a wrist rocket,

05:40.474 --> 05:41.742
thrown rock,
brick, tire iron,

05:41.809 --> 05:43.377
golf club, and then
a rifle shot.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.012
Now we're looking
at a hand gun

05:45.078 --> 05:45.946
from close range.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.781
Victims don't fit
a profile, either.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.817
DAVID:
Yeah, it's rich, poor, Asian,

05:49.883 --> 05:51.685
Latino, whites,
across the spectrum.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.620
MEGAN:
You know, maybe instead

05:52.686 --> 05:55.088
of one sociopath,
we have a bunch of copycats.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.057
Maybe there's no pattern at all.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.392
MEGAN:
That's what
I just said, Charlie.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.960
There's no pattern.

06:00.027 --> 06:00.961
A single assailant,

06:01.028 --> 06:03.697
or a bunch of copycats
both imply a pattern.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.699
No, What I'm
suggesting here is,

06:05.766 --> 06:07.535
these groupings of shootings
might, you know,

06:07.601 --> 06:08.902
very well be random.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.304
Seven completely
unrelated attacks?

06:11.371 --> 06:13.674
CHARLIE:
Sure. Consider this.

06:13.741 --> 06:16.376
An MP3 player has a random
shuffle function, right?

06:16.444 --> 06:17.645
It uses an algorithm

06:17.711 --> 06:20.280
to create a random order
to play the songs.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.182
But when people listen

06:22.249 --> 06:24.351
to their random shuffle mode,

06:24.418 --> 06:26.319
they do perceive patterns.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.955
That's just
pure coincidence.

06:28.021 --> 06:31.659
People swear their MP3 players
like to play certain songs.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.161
I know mine has a thing
for ZZ Top.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.162
CHARLIE:
Right, right.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.165
And that's exactly it-- that
human beings perceive patterns

06:38.231 --> 06:39.867
where there just aren't any.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.335
All right, look, you know,
until we know different,

06:42.402 --> 06:45.639
then we're gonna pursue these
as individual crimes, all right?

06:45.706 --> 06:47.340
Hey.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.810
Hey, Larry, do
you have a minute?

06:49.877 --> 06:52.446
Yes, I have the eight
and a half minutes

06:52.513 --> 06:54.347
it takes me to walk
to my office.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.816
Now, if we need more time,

06:55.883 --> 06:57.851
I guess we could choose
a longer route,

06:57.918 --> 07:00.087
maybe stop and contemplate
the turtle pond.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.923
Or we could just keep
talking at your office.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.925
Yeah, it's not
as scenic, but sure.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.027
You know, I'm finding
it a little strange,

07:07.094 --> 07:09.963
uh, being a professor after
being a student for so long.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.331
(laughing):
Oh.

07:11.398 --> 07:13.467
We have all been there,
my young friend.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.369
I mean, I feel like I
should be going to lectures,

07:16.436 --> 07:17.571
not giving them.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.540
You know, I run
into former teachers

07:19.607 --> 07:22.009
every day, who act
like nothing's changed.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.477
That's why, you know,

07:23.544 --> 07:25.746
people usually leave the school

07:25.813 --> 07:28.348
where they earn their doctorate
and go off and teach elsewhere.

07:28.415 --> 07:31.118
But, what, CalSci made you
an offer you couldn't refuse?

07:31.184 --> 07:32.185
I don't know.

07:32.252 --> 07:35.088
Maybe I would have been
better off on the East Coast.

07:35.155 --> 07:38.058
No, no, no, no. Come on,
this is not about geography.

07:38.125 --> 07:42.830
Listen, you yourself
must embrace this new role.

07:42.896 --> 07:46.834
'Cause only then will others
be able to see you differently.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.736
Wow.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.804
Larry, even for you,
that was profound.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.773
I guess you just caught me
when the caffeine

07:52.840 --> 07:54.808
was kicking in.
Come on.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.678
MEGAN:
I get the concept of
random clusters, I do,

07:57.745 --> 07:59.680
but road rage is associated
with certain factors,

07:59.747 --> 08:02.182
none of which are present
in any of these cases.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.316
Wait. When you say factors,

08:03.383 --> 08:04.417
you mean, like,
what, like weather?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.687
Yeah, and bad traffic, and
racial conflicts, and accidents.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.689
Stuff that makes people tense
and angry.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.223
All right, so,
it's not a typical streak.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.425
No, and there's something else--
the youngest boy, Pete, said

08:12.492 --> 08:13.961
he thought he saw a
white pickup truck.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.663
Now he thinks he
saw the same truck

08:15.729 --> 08:16.830
drive by his house
that morning.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.031
What? A white pickup truck?

08:18.098 --> 08:19.833
I mean, they're all over
the place.

08:19.900 --> 08:23.336
He says both had a bobble-headed
hula dancer on the dashboard.

08:23.403 --> 08:24.838
Yeah? What do you think?

08:24.905 --> 08:26.840
I think he's nine, and
he's been traumatized,

08:26.907 --> 08:29.109
and he's searching, but
it opens up the possibility

08:29.176 --> 08:31.111
that Jeff Kinkirk
was stalked, you know?

08:31.178 --> 08:32.746
That he's not
a random victim.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.948
All right. Well, look,
play both sides. I mean,

08:35.015 --> 08:37.484
get a list of white
pickup trucks from the DMV

08:37.551 --> 08:38.752
and-and work it
with the guys.

08:38.819 --> 08:39.853
What's the
other side?

08:39.920 --> 08:41.521
Well, the wife said
she didn't think

08:41.589 --> 08:43.023
the husband had any enemies,
but, I mean,

08:43.090 --> 08:44.858
maybe she was hiding
something from us.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.027
Okay.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.598
I took out the garbage,

08:50.664 --> 08:53.300
helped Pete
with his homework.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.503
Everything's good at home.

08:56.570 --> 09:00.207
(knocking)

09:00.273 --> 09:01.742
DON:
Hey.

09:01.809 --> 09:04.344
How's he doing?

09:04.411 --> 09:06.346
They got the bullet out.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.616
Now we just have to wait.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.984
PETE:
Did you find

09:11.051 --> 09:12.052
the white truck?

09:12.119 --> 09:12.986
Not yet, Pete,

09:13.053 --> 09:17.157
but, I mean, we got a lot
of people working on it.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.792
Guys, I need to
speak to your mom

09:18.859 --> 09:20.027
for a minute.
Is that okay?

09:23.463 --> 09:26.166
DON:
Your son Pete thinks

09:26.233 --> 09:29.369
he saw a white pickup truck
the day of the shooting.

09:29.436 --> 09:30.604
Now it's possible

09:30.671 --> 09:33.140
that that same truck
was near your house that day.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.208
Someone was
following Jeff?

09:35.275 --> 09:37.044
Yeah.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.913
Any reason for that?

09:39.980 --> 09:42.215
No. I-I can't think
of anything.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.151
Does your husband have
any problems at work,

09:44.217 --> 09:45.653
or with neighbors,
anything at all?

09:45.719 --> 09:47.287
No, there's nothing.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.122
Anyone want to hurt you?

09:49.189 --> 09:50.290
Me?
Yeah.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.625
Not that I know of.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.193
Marla, somebody tried

09:53.260 --> 09:54.862
to kill your husband,
and, I mean,

09:54.928 --> 09:56.496
you have no idea
about who or why?

09:56.563 --> 09:59.066
It doesn't make sense.
I mean, it could
be something minor.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.334
Just even a-a fight
over a parking space.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.203
That's just it.
You have to understand Jeff.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.773
He'd let someone else
have the parking space.

10:05.839 --> 10:10.477
(voice breaking):
If he has a flaw, it's that
he tries too hard to be nice.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.946
Okay. All right,
that's-that's all I need.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.148
Come on. That's all right.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.826
We were looking
for a white truck.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.762
I've checked 177 so far.

10:28.829 --> 10:32.666
I'm just also checking
some other factors.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.268
Looking at traffic, weather,

10:35.335 --> 10:36.970
employment,

10:37.037 --> 10:38.872
time of day, day of the week.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.141
Looking for a pattern
in a series

10:41.208 --> 10:42.175
of random events?

10:42.242 --> 10:44.712
Oh, dear, Professor
Eppes wouldn't approve.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.179
Okay, but here's the thing.

10:46.246 --> 10:49.349
None of these attacks can be
linked to the typical causes

10:49.416 --> 10:50.718
of freeway violence

10:50.784 --> 10:53.453
like bad traffic
and hot weather.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.354
Gang shootings.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.255
Seven random freeway attacks,

10:55.322 --> 10:57.624
and not one of them
fits a profile

10:57.691 --> 10:59.026
of a random freeway attack?

10:59.092 --> 11:00.193
Yeah, I see what you're saying.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.729
At least some should have
typical causes.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.463
All we have are
invisible assailants

11:03.530 --> 11:04.965
and no motives.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.133
Yeah, I mean, is it possible

11:06.199 --> 11:11.038
for something to be too random
to be random?

11:13.540 --> 11:14.908
CHARLIE:
I'm sorry, too random?

11:14.975 --> 11:17.044
MEGAN:
Yeah.
Too ran...

11:17.110 --> 11:20.547
Uh, something can be
a little random.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.615
Something can
be very random.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.951
But, no.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.220
No, no,
not, not too random.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.121
Why?

11:28.188 --> 11:29.689
Well, we're just kind of
assuming

11:29.757 --> 11:32.793
that all these freeway attacks
are a series of random events,

11:32.860 --> 11:34.762
but not one of them
can be linked

11:34.828 --> 11:36.897
to the typical causes
of freeway violence.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.365
You mean, like road rage,
stuff like that?

11:38.431 --> 11:39.566
Yeah, actually.

11:39.632 --> 11:44.171
70% of all traffic assaults stem
from arguments between drivers,

11:44.237 --> 11:45.873
especially if one or the other

11:45.939 --> 11:48.942
has something called
Intermittent Explosive Disorder.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.278
Oh, we used to call that
having a screw loose.

11:51.344 --> 11:54.047
(laughing):
My dad had...
that screw loose,

11:54.114 --> 11:57.284
but, uh, explosive rage
can be a little more serious.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.318
People can erupt

11:58.385 --> 12:00.954
into violent anger for
seemingly no reason.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.923
I see what you're saying.
Okay.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.558
You're saying that in
this particular string,

12:05.625 --> 12:07.795
there are none of
the typical causes.
Mm-hmm.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.329
And what are the odds of that?

12:09.396 --> 12:11.731
I would say
that they're not very good.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.867
What if there's a pattern that
you're just not able to detect?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.804
Hidden variable theory.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.305
The idea that, that

12:18.371 --> 12:20.808
nothing in this world
is ever really random,

12:20.874 --> 12:22.342
that there is
some influence

12:22.409 --> 12:24.744
or some force
that we can't detect.

12:24.812 --> 12:27.747
Isn't it, like, weird that none
of these attacks are typical?

12:27.815 --> 12:28.782
Not one?

12:28.849 --> 12:31.952
Weird, yeah, yeah.
Unlikely, yeah.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.321
Impossible, no.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.559
How's it going?

12:39.626 --> 12:44.764
White pickups checked:
1,307.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.767
Only about 162,000 left to go.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.236
Oh, just think

12:49.302 --> 12:51.604
of the sense of accomplishment
you'll have when you're done.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.140
Right.
How you doing?

12:53.206 --> 12:55.008
Looking for connections
between people,

12:55.075 --> 12:56.676
you always find more
than you expect, you know.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.846
Yeah, most of it doesn't
mean anything, though.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.814
Two victims wore the
same brand of jeans,

13:00.881 --> 13:02.082
went to the same college.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.051
I got one I want
to take a look at.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.990
These two victims
used the same car wash?

13:10.057 --> 13:11.624
I want to get a
list of employees,

13:11.691 --> 13:12.759
see if anybody
has a record.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.996
All right, I'll check
with the local cops.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.730
COLBY:
Victims number two
and number five,

13:17.797 --> 13:19.900
Henry Rains and Cece Smith.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.969
They're both patrons
of the Valley Car Wash.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.136
DON:
Uh-huh.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.737
Now, Rains got into
a yelling match

13:24.804 --> 13:25.973
with one of the
workers there.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.475
Two weeks later, he's
killed by a rifle shot.

13:28.541 --> 13:29.442
What was the fight about?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.879
He accused the worker of
taking money out of his car,

13:31.945 --> 13:33.046
started getting
loud with him,

13:33.113 --> 13:35.082
so the car wash manager
had to call the cops,

13:35.148 --> 13:36.616
but Rains split
before they got there.

13:36.683 --> 13:37.650
So who did he accuse?

13:37.717 --> 13:38.551
Calvin Oates.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.487
Five years ago,
he's thrown out of a bar.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.856
Comes back, fires a handgun
out the front window

13:42.923 --> 13:44.057
from a moving car.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.326
Car wash have links to any
of the other victims?

13:46.393 --> 13:47.294
Still working on it.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.197
All right, it's thin,
but go pick him up.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.039
Manager special
today: $11.95.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.507
Wax, underbody,
tire dressing.

14:00.573 --> 14:01.474
What air freshener?

14:01.541 --> 14:04.344
We let the FBI garage take
care of all that, thank you.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.914
Hey, we're looking
for Calvin Oates.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.855
Oh, man, I just had
this suit cleaned.

14:30.603 --> 14:31.571
(yells)

14:31.638 --> 14:33.040
You, back up!
Back up!

14:33.106 --> 14:34.541
Give me the bat,
give me the bat.

14:34.607 --> 14:35.475
Thank you.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.810
Next time, leave it
to the professionals.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.947
(groans)

14:40.013 --> 14:41.181
You're fired.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.283
COLBY:
Come on.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.124
Dude said I stole his money.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.927
He started screaming,
coming at me.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.595
I didn't do nothing.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.698
When the manager called
the cops, he split.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.000
So why'd you run?

15:00.067 --> 15:01.534
I'm stupid.

15:01.601 --> 15:02.635
(laughing):
Yeah.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.504
When cops show up, I get lost.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.206
I didn't think they'd bother
to chase me

15:06.273 --> 15:08.275
'cause... I didn't
do anything wrong.

15:08.341 --> 15:11.111
Well, that guy must have
made you furious.

15:11.178 --> 15:12.345
He called you a thief

15:12.412 --> 15:14.381
in front of your boss
and your co-workers.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.483
Don't start the psych crap.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.985
I've been in anger
management therapy

15:18.051 --> 15:19.186
for three years.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.887
I know when someone's
pushing my buttons.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.322
You got a lot of buttons, huh?

15:23.423 --> 15:24.357
That therapy was

15:24.424 --> 15:27.060
court-mandated as a condition
of your parole.

15:27.127 --> 15:31.664
Yes, and believe me,
I am now the poster boy

15:31.731 --> 15:32.665
for anger management.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.404
That must be
one ugly poster.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.973
Yeah, time cards show him at
work when Rains was shot, so...

15:40.040 --> 15:41.408
You don't think he's the guy.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.043
Either there isn't a guy...

15:43.110 --> 15:44.311
And it's seven
unrelated incidents.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.678
(phone rings)
...or, if it's one guy,

15:45.745 --> 15:47.814
he's definitely a lot
smarter than this dude.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.517
Hey.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.584
All right.

15:51.651 --> 15:52.852
We just got another one.

15:52.919 --> 15:54.554
Well, there you go.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.457
(indistinct radio
communication)

15:59.026 --> 16:00.994
Victim was a 28-year-old
computer tech.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.195
Died instantly.

16:03.096 --> 16:06.399
The killer had to lug

16:06.466 --> 16:07.000
this cinder block up to the
top of the tunnel entrance,

16:07.067 --> 16:08.935
time the drop to hit a car,

16:09.002 --> 16:12.239
and avoid being
seen by witnesses.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.608
DAVID:
That took work,
planning.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.744
I doubt it was vandals
or some crime of impulse.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.480
You think she was
targeted or just unlucky?

16:20.547 --> 16:22.749
DAVID:
I think she never
knew what hit her.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.290
Hey.

16:30.357 --> 16:34.027
Pythagorean theorem,
law of cosines,

16:34.094 --> 16:35.995
metrics.
Equivalence principle.

16:36.063 --> 16:37.430
Back to basics.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.232
You know, I spent the weekend
at Politzer's

16:39.299 --> 16:40.367
and he completely disassembled

16:40.433 --> 16:42.835
my 11-D supergravity
theory.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.972
So here I am in ten dimensions
with two pea-brain solutions,

16:46.039 --> 16:47.074
electrically
and magnetically charged

16:47.140 --> 16:50.143
respectively to the C-field...

16:50.210 --> 16:51.711
You still sleeping
in your office?

16:51.778 --> 16:53.480
Yeah, sleeping, living.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.382
Cuts down
on the morning commute.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.783
You must find a
new place to live.
No.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.951
You can't live out
of your office.
No, I'm not
going to be out there

16:59.018 --> 17:00.687
choosing wall colors
and toaster ovens.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.755
Look, I just want
to be thinking about gravity.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.691
How do you expect
to have company over?

17:04.757 --> 17:05.492
What company?

17:05.558 --> 17:06.493
Who?
Oh, I don't know.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.961
Who, I may-- who, what,
M-Megan, maybe?

17:09.028 --> 17:10.063
Oh, oh, oh, listen.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.165
If you propose to start
discussing my love life,

17:12.232 --> 17:14.767
then I'm gonna find yours
to be fair game.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.136
Ah, point, point.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.371
Point to Professor
Fleinhardt.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.572
Hey, so, speaking
of Megan,

17:19.639 --> 17:21.274
she comes by the
house the other day,

17:21.341 --> 17:24.611
wants to know if a
sequence can be too random.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.247
It's funny.

17:27.314 --> 17:29.216
I... fail to see
the humor in this.

17:29.282 --> 17:33.420
Too random, you know, as
in excessively random.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.555
Yeah, I'm, I'm following you.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.490
I will now ask you
a series of questions

17:37.557 --> 17:39.326
and I would like you
to answer simply

17:39.392 --> 17:40.793
in the affirmative
or the negative.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.262
Okay.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.396
This discussion of randomness.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.932
Was it somehow related
to the freeway attacks?

17:45.998 --> 17:47.367
Yes.
Okay,
might she be concerned

17:47.434 --> 17:50.537
that all of the attacks
have different MOs?

17:50.603 --> 17:51.804
Yeah, but...

17:51.871 --> 17:53.940
And given seven random attacks,
all with different meth...

17:54.006 --> 17:54.941
Eight now.

17:55.007 --> 17:57.410
Okay, eight random attacks,
all with different methods.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.945
I mean, might'nt
she just find

17:59.011 --> 18:03.550
the improbability of all this
just a little bit disconcerting?

18:03.616 --> 18:08.521
Larry, you know, I can, I can
roll a pair of dice eight times

18:08.588 --> 18:11.023
and never get
the same result twice,

18:11.090 --> 18:13.260
and that would still fall
within the realm of random.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.528
Yeah... but something
that doesn't repeat

18:15.595 --> 18:18.531
is not by definition random.

18:22.068 --> 18:24.404
Shuffle mode.
Hmm?

18:25.305 --> 18:27.140
Shuffle mode.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.375
Why am I such an idiot?

18:30.277 --> 18:32.212
I think I've
found new attacks.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.546
These are
insurance claims?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.682
Mm-hmm.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.151
There's damage reports
of objects striking cars.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.552
Smart angle.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.288
I have my moments, I think.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.889
I was trying to find
related incidents

18:42.955 --> 18:44.991
that didn't result
in any bodily injury.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.159
COLBY:
Objects used include a rock,

18:46.226 --> 18:49.061
a large slab of marble,
a lead weight,

18:49.128 --> 18:50.363
a steel pipe.

18:50.430 --> 18:53.533
No injuries,
so no police report.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.534
Megan.

18:54.601 --> 18:55.635
Hey.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.437
I am so sorry.
What's the matter?

18:57.504 --> 18:59.172
You were right,
I was wrong.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.473
About the
freeway attacks?

19:00.540 --> 19:03.210
Yeah.
Remember shuffle mode?

19:03.276 --> 19:04.211
Yeah, the patterns
that aren't there.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.179
Controlled by an algorithm

19:06.246 --> 19:08.448
that creates a random order
for the songs,

19:08.515 --> 19:09.982
but the order isn't
really random

19:10.049 --> 19:13.386
because the algorithm
won't ever repeat a song.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.789
Just like the freeway
attacks don't repeat.
That's what I was saying!

19:16.856 --> 19:18.458
So these attacks could be
the act of one person...

19:18.525 --> 19:20.092
Who's trying to make them
look random.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.261
Thank you.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.562
Let me show you something.

19:23.796 --> 19:27.033
All right,
here are five new incidents.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.135
CHARLIE:
Five?

19:29.202 --> 19:30.102
I didn't hear about that
on the news.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.739
Oh, these cases haven't
been included before now.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.474
Megan just found them.
All right, now,

19:34.541 --> 19:37.277
let's look at them
chronologically
with the others.

19:44.284 --> 19:48.888
That's a fairly regular pattern,
showing increasing frequency.

19:48.955 --> 19:49.889
Thank you.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.658
Okay, I'm going
to call this one.

19:51.724 --> 19:52.759
I am 99% sure.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.361
The varied methods
are an attempt

19:54.427 --> 19:56.095
to avoid any
discernible pattern...

19:56.162 --> 19:57.430
Which is in itself
a pattern.

19:57.497 --> 19:58.965
Yes, but what the
perpetrator can't hide

19:59.031 --> 20:00.967
is the intensity of his need.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.435
The compulsion is growing,

20:02.502 --> 20:05.137
so the time between acts is
getting shorter and shorter.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.473
Classic serial killer.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.442
We're looking at one guy.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.886
You guys, check this out.

20:19.952 --> 20:23.122
Just found that five
of the 13 victims

20:23.189 --> 20:25.992
were involved in serious
injury accidents over the course

20:26.058 --> 20:27.694
of the last
two years.
Oh, yeah?

20:27.760 --> 20:28.728
Think that
means anything?

20:28.795 --> 20:29.929
I'm not sure
if that would

20:29.996 --> 20:32.231
hold true for any
similar group or not.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.033
Maybe call a CHP
accident specialist.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.568
And the department of insurance.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.069
Five of 13--
that's less than half, man.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.272
Yeah, I don't know if it's
just coincidence or not.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.574
Well, let's find out.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.183
So, Professor, you think
it's safe to drive, huh?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.853
Even with this crazy person
out there attacking cars?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.788
People get killed in
car accidents every day.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.525
It's not like we worry about
that when we get on the road.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.759
Uh-huh, speak
for yourself.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.261
Look, if you're worried
about the freeway killer,

21:02.329 --> 21:03.996
you know, take the bus.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.131
The bus does not go everywhere.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.032
In case you missed it,

21:06.098 --> 21:07.967
we live in Los Angeles,
the city of the car.

21:08.034 --> 21:12.138
You know, people in L.A. spend
100 hours a year in traffic.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.406
100 hours.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.574
That's four full days of waiting

21:14.641 --> 21:16.476
for the car in front
of you to move.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.978
I'm getting road rage
just thinking about it.

21:19.045 --> 21:22.081
But, seriously, you are twice
as likely to hit a royal flush

21:22.148 --> 21:24.717
on your first hand of poker
than you are of being

21:24.784 --> 21:25.952
a victim of this
freeway attacker.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.087
Yeah, but I'm not afraid
of hitting a royal flush.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.857
I'll still be around
to play the next hand.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.759
You want me to behave
irrationally and tell you

21:32.825 --> 21:35.161
that, yes, I would prefer
if my only living parent

21:35.227 --> 21:38.064
stayed off the roads until
we catch this guy, okay?

21:38.130 --> 21:40.232
There, I said it. You happy?

21:40.299 --> 21:41.734
No! I have to drive

21:41.801 --> 21:42.969
to Culver City.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.337
My mall project.

21:44.404 --> 21:47.940
I don't know why
I let you do this to me.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.175
I should see it coming.

21:49.241 --> 21:50.443
Yeah, but you
never do.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.684
Hey, look who's awake.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.218
Hi.

21:59.285 --> 22:00.252
Honey, this is

22:00.319 --> 22:01.921
the FBI agent I told you about.

22:02.922 --> 22:03.456
Anything new?

22:03.523 --> 22:05.224
Well, what we're working with

22:05.291 --> 22:08.127
is that in five of the attacks,
the victims have been involved

22:08.194 --> 22:09.429
in a serious car accident.

22:09.496 --> 22:10.963
So we're checking
on the others,

22:11.030 --> 22:12.532
but, uh... no?

22:12.599 --> 22:13.800
Jeff hasn't had
so much as

22:13.866 --> 22:16.569
a speeding ticket
since we were married.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.304
No, I... I'm careful.

22:18.371 --> 22:19.606
I worry about the kids.

22:20.873 --> 22:23.175
A couple years ago,
I saw this...

22:23.242 --> 22:25.311
bad accident where
this little boy was hurt.

22:25.378 --> 22:26.312
It was terrible.

22:26.379 --> 22:27.447
Yeah, you say you saw this?

22:27.514 --> 22:28.881
JEFF:
Yeah.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.718
An SUV ran through this light
and smacked a sedan.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.287
I tried to help out
at the scene.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.690
I gave a statement
to the police.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.361
Jeff Kinkirk was the only
witness to an accident

22:42.429 --> 22:44.330
that left a six-year-old boy
badly injured.

22:44.397 --> 22:47.567
Now, Kinkirk says he saw the
boy's father run a red light.

22:47.634 --> 22:48.935
Father said he didn't.

22:49.001 --> 22:51.804
But both insurance companies
went with Kinkirk's account.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.305
Well, a lot of people
witness accidents.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.275
Yeah, but they don't all end up
with gunshot wounds to the head.

22:56.342 --> 22:59.378
It's such a strange motive
for a series of attacks.

22:59.446 --> 23:01.781
Yes, it is,
because serial attacks

23:01.848 --> 23:04.116
generally have a sado-sexual
component to them.

23:04.183 --> 23:06.619
The assailant needs to
see the victim suffer.

23:06.686 --> 23:07.687
But not this guy.

23:07.754 --> 23:08.921
He wants to inflict
serious damage,

23:08.988 --> 23:10.823
but he's happy to do
it from a distance.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.759
And he's not
that intent on

23:12.825 --> 23:14.494
killing every victim.
So how would

23:14.561 --> 23:15.528
the profile break down?

23:15.595 --> 23:18.164
Likely male,
and meticulous and educated.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.500
History of road rage,
problems with anger.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.301
Might have difficulty
holding a job.

23:22.368 --> 23:23.836
He identifies with the victims.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.304
He feels a sense of injustice.

23:25.371 --> 23:27.406
He's probably a victim of
a violent crime himself.

23:27.474 --> 23:28.675
Or someone close to him is.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.410
Well, we could get a list
of major injury accidents

23:31.478 --> 23:32.679
and cross-check them
against the victims.

23:32.745 --> 23:33.846
DON:
Yeah, we'll let Charlie run

23:33.913 --> 23:36.148
whatever we come up with, and
get a suspect list going, yeah?

23:36.215 --> 23:37.183
Yeah, anything
will help.

23:37.249 --> 23:41.688
What do we have, five million
drivers in L.A. County?

23:41.754 --> 23:44.857
The optimization algorithm
can be translated into software.

23:44.924 --> 23:45.692
You know what?

23:45.758 --> 23:47.026
I think
Amita has it.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.662
But there's stuff
in here we can use.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.598
How's it going
with Amita?
Huh?

23:51.664 --> 23:52.699
Oh, good, good.

23:52.765 --> 23:53.766
No, yeah, she's-- I mean,

23:53.833 --> 23:55.434
we're both pretty
busy right now.

23:55.502 --> 23:56.803
You know, she's a professor now.

23:56.869 --> 23:57.604
Yeah.

23:57.670 --> 23:58.505
It's always tough, huh?

23:58.571 --> 23:59.839
What's always tough?

23:59.906 --> 24:01.107
The whole thing, you know?

24:01.173 --> 24:02.742
It's just tough.

24:02.809 --> 24:03.910
How you doing with Robin?

24:03.976 --> 24:06.946
Yeah, well, it is what it is.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.114
Yeah.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.717
I know you don't like to talk
about who you're seeing.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.218
Hey, Charlie, if I have
anything worthwhile to say,

24:12.284 --> 24:14.053
believe me, you'd be
at the top of my list.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.956
You know who else doesn't like
to talk about his love life?

24:17.023 --> 24:18.625
Your boy Larry.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.159
What do you know?

24:20.226 --> 24:22.261
I know Megan thinks
he's beautiful.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.096
(mouths)

24:27.033 --> 24:28.835
What does he say?
It's difficult
to decipher

24:28.901 --> 24:31.370
through all the, you know,
the cosmological metaphors.

24:31.437 --> 24:32.872
But he does
really seem to

24:32.939 --> 24:34.373
really like her, you know?

24:34.440 --> 24:35.942
Hey, here we go, I found it.

24:36.008 --> 24:36.976
All right.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.210
(chuckles)
Okay.

24:38.277 --> 24:40.513
(clears throat)
Before we run Amita's program,

24:40.580 --> 24:41.881
I need to draw up
some parameters,

24:41.948 --> 24:43.349
because there's a component
we're neglecting.

24:43.415 --> 24:44.383
What's that?

24:44.450 --> 24:45.184
Traffic.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.786
I mean, this guy's
been attacking people

24:46.853 --> 24:48.521
in broad daylight,
on busy roads,

24:48.588 --> 24:50.322
running the risk of being seen.

24:50.389 --> 24:51.390
Right.
No witnesses.

24:51.457 --> 24:52.592
So he must be
planning carefully.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.561
He probably
plans escape routes.

24:54.627 --> 24:55.394
Yeah, possibly.

24:55.461 --> 24:56.629
All right, so if we can

24:56.696 --> 24:58.631
look at the traffic patterns
in the vicinity

24:58.698 --> 25:00.032
of the attacks,
that'll give us

25:00.099 --> 25:02.168
a chance to guess
at those escape routes,

25:02.234 --> 25:04.236
which will give us
a more general idea

25:04.303 --> 25:05.237
of where he goes
afterward.

25:05.304 --> 25:06.773
Right, 'cause he'd
definitely want to avoid

25:06.839 --> 25:08.140
traffic in each
instance, right?

25:08.207 --> 25:09.175
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.177
No, traffic flows
just like any other, you know,

25:11.243 --> 25:13.245
dynamic fluid flow
in a closed system.

25:13.312 --> 25:15.582
You know, it's like the
water in your house.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.917
Water flows due to
pressure and release.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.986
What is the optimum
length and width of the pipe?

25:20.052 --> 25:21.187
What are the number
of branches?

25:21.253 --> 25:22.922
How many release points
are there?

25:22.989 --> 25:24.924
I mean, it's a little more
complicated for traffic,

25:24.991 --> 25:27.126
but partial differential
equations can help us

25:27.193 --> 25:30.396
calculate the optimum number
of lanes, on- and off-ramps,

25:30.462 --> 25:32.064
signal synchronization.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.934
And I can use data
from road sensors,

25:35.001 --> 25:37.069
traffic cameras and
satellite imagery.

25:37.136 --> 25:40.372
I mean, hell, I can even factor
in the street light algorithms

25:40.439 --> 25:41.608
used by the D.O.T.

25:41.674 --> 25:43.676
This is fairly high-level math.

25:45.612 --> 25:48.014
So ten out of 13
have been involved

25:48.080 --> 25:49.816
in some sort of
serious injury accident.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.084
Six are directly involved.

25:52.151 --> 25:54.086
There's a lawyer
for an insurance company,

25:54.153 --> 25:56.823
two accident witnesses
and a tow truck driver.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.758
And we're still trying to
connect the last three.

25:58.825 --> 26:01.327
Yeah, unfortunately,
this guy works to a schedule,

26:01.393 --> 26:03.663
and, you know, he's due now.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.998
(sighs)

26:08.100 --> 26:08.935
Oh, look!

26:09.001 --> 26:11.303
It's CalSci's
live-in cosmologist.

26:11.370 --> 26:12.471
Listen, don't laugh.

26:12.538 --> 26:15.642
I think that couch of mine
has finally fused my vertebrae.

26:17.443 --> 26:18.310
What's going on, Larry?

26:18.377 --> 26:20.112
Is there something you
want to talk about?

26:20.179 --> 26:21.113
No.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.015
I find any discussion
of my inner feelings

26:23.082 --> 26:24.717
to be potentially catastrophic.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.418
It's like a star--

26:26.485 --> 26:28.154
burns up all of its own fuel

26:28.220 --> 26:30.690
and then finally collapses
in on top of itself.

26:30.757 --> 26:34.293
I was just trying to be
supportive here, Larry,

26:34.360 --> 26:36.896
not destroy a solar system.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.130
CHARLIE:
Who needs a caffeine fix?

26:38.197 --> 26:39.999
LARRY:
Hey, you know
what RГ©nyi said?

26:40.066 --> 26:42.034
He said a mathematician
is a machine

26:42.101 --> 26:43.870
that turns coffee
into theorems.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.571
(Charlie chuckles)

26:45.638 --> 26:47.239
Thank you for getting
on this so fast.

26:47.306 --> 26:50.509
Hey, I don't want to be shot or
struck by a brick while driving

26:50.576 --> 26:51.811
any more than
the next person.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.746
You know, I guess there's
nothing to be done

26:53.813 --> 26:55.748
about meteors-- well, just yet.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.684
CHARLIE:
No, Larry, even the FBI

26:57.750 --> 26:58.818
can't stop meteors.

26:58.885 --> 27:00.987
No, not yet, but someday.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.488
We'll have plasma cannons,

27:02.554 --> 27:04.290
steam rockets.

27:04.356 --> 27:05.357
Anything interesting?

27:05.424 --> 27:07.526
Well, I loaded the data
into the modeling software.

27:07.593 --> 27:09.261
It should produce
a clear graphic

27:09.328 --> 27:10.963
of the flow of traffic
after the attacks.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.032
I'll put it up
on the LCD.
Great.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.234
Also, I compressed time,
so that 30 minutes

27:15.301 --> 27:16.335
plays in 30 seconds.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.605
And what's this?

27:19.672 --> 27:21.573
It's a traffic anomaly-- a
street adjacent to the freeway.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.641
Pull it up.

27:22.709 --> 27:23.976
(beeping)

27:24.043 --> 27:25.011
Huh.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.312
CHARLIE:
Look at that flow.

27:26.378 --> 27:27.847
Optimized in one direction,

27:27.914 --> 27:30.182
all the cross streets
are backing up.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.451
Pull up another one.

27:32.518 --> 27:33.720
(beeping)

27:33.786 --> 27:36.388
Yeah, there it is again, wow.

27:36.455 --> 27:37.389
And this timecode

27:37.456 --> 27:38.958
is telling us
that this is

27:39.025 --> 27:40.126
after the shooting attack.

27:40.192 --> 27:41.327
It's like someone opened up

27:41.393 --> 27:43.495
an escape valve for traffic
coming off the freeway.

27:43.562 --> 27:45.832
It's more like
an escape route.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.202
(horn honking)

27:51.670 --> 27:53.672
MAN:
Come on! Get out of the way!

27:53.740 --> 27:55.674
(horn blaring)

27:55.742 --> 27:57.409
WOMAN:
Move out of the way, lady!

27:57.476 --> 27:59.746
(siren whoops)

28:02.849 --> 28:05.818
(low, indistinct radio
communication)

28:13.292 --> 28:14.994
Ma'am?

28:15.895 --> 28:17.096
(tapping)

28:17.163 --> 28:18.865
Ma'am, roll down your window.

28:34.713 --> 28:35.948
MEGAN:
Kathryn Krager.

28:36.015 --> 28:39.085
She's 46 years old, she
has two teenage children.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.220
She works for the
City of Bellhaven.

28:41.287 --> 28:42.221
Notify the family?

28:42.288 --> 28:43.622
CHP's at the house now,
actually.

28:43.689 --> 28:44.824
All right,
we got to see

28:44.891 --> 28:46.258
if she fits the traffic accident
scenario, right?

28:46.325 --> 28:48.427
This is the second
gunshot wound

28:48.494 --> 28:49.661
at close range.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.230
That's new.

28:51.297 --> 28:52.965
All the other ones were
different forms of attack.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.133
What? Different guy?

28:54.200 --> 28:55.902
No, I think it's the same guy,

28:55.968 --> 28:57.804
he's just not afraid
to repeat himself now.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.906
Yeah, he thinks
we can't catch him.

28:59.972 --> 29:01.774
And he might be right.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.675
Come on, you know
we can get this guy.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.444
All right, if you say so.

29:05.511 --> 29:07.146
And how about
the next one on deck?

29:07.213 --> 29:09.481
What's going on with you?

29:09.548 --> 29:12.151
Nothing.

29:14.020 --> 29:17.990
No record the victim was
ever in a traffic accident.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.826
That was Krager's boss--

29:19.892 --> 29:21.260
the city manager
for Bellhaven.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.796
Said that two years ago,
a neighborhood submitted

29:23.863 --> 29:25.764
a petition for a light
at a blind intersection,

29:25.832 --> 29:27.834
and Krager was in charge

29:27.900 --> 29:28.968
of overseeing
the traffic budget,

29:29.035 --> 29:30.669
and she turned
down the petition.

29:30.736 --> 29:34.640
So she wasn't actually involved
in an accident herself.

29:34.706 --> 29:36.275
Somebody might blame her
for causing one.

29:36.342 --> 29:37.376
Right.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.711
So an accident happened six
months after Krager denied

29:39.778 --> 29:42.681
a request to have a traffic
light put at this intersection.

29:42.748 --> 29:43.983
Three people in two vehicles.

29:44.050 --> 29:46.452
One person survived:
Brennon Sommers.

29:46.518 --> 29:49.989
His wife, the driver of the
other vehicle died at the scene.

29:50.056 --> 29:51.657
And Sommers suffered
a head injury.

29:51.723 --> 29:53.325
Anger and impulse
control problems.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.627
He's lost his job,
he's living on disability.

29:55.694 --> 29:56.662
He's been arrested twice

29:56.728 --> 29:59.031
since the accident,
although the charges

29:59.098 --> 30:00.432
were dropped both times.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.134
Well, I can see where
he might blame Krager

30:02.201 --> 30:03.335
for not putting in
the stoplight, right?

30:03.402 --> 30:04.937
COLBY:
Yeah, but she wasn't
the first victim.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.638
I mean, why kill
other people first?

30:06.705 --> 30:07.739
MEGAN:
Well, maybe his first victim

30:07.806 --> 30:10.509
set him off some other way,
and then once he got going,

30:10.576 --> 30:12.378
he went back for Krager.

30:29.428 --> 30:30.496
Brennon Sommers!

30:30.562 --> 30:32.064
COLBY:
Put your hands up

30:32.131 --> 30:33.532
and walk over
this way.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.234
What is this about?

30:35.301 --> 30:39.171
Put your hands up and
walk over this way.

30:39.238 --> 30:42.008
Get your hands up!
Turn around right now!

30:43.910 --> 30:46.145
What?! What?!

30:54.887 --> 30:58.390
I was an architect.

30:58.457 --> 31:01.093
And now...

31:01.160 --> 31:02.494
I can't concentrate.

31:02.561 --> 31:06.365
I can't read for more than
a minute at a time.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.200
And that's Kathryn
Krager's fault?

31:08.267 --> 31:09.401
Who?!

31:09.468 --> 31:10.802
Who is that?!

31:10.869 --> 31:12.004
I think you know.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.772
I mean, you wrote a letter
to the L.A. Times,

31:13.839 --> 31:16.742
because Bellhaven wouldn't
put in a traffic light.

31:16.808 --> 31:18.410
She was behind
the decision.

31:18.477 --> 31:19.778
I blamed the city, yeah,

31:19.845 --> 31:22.314
but I never knew
who made the decision.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.216
And you do get into
a lot of fights.

31:24.283 --> 31:26.152
Maybe because people
don't treat you fairly?

31:26.218 --> 31:29.855
No, because I have anger
and impulse problems.

31:29.922 --> 31:32.691
It comes with
the frontal lobe damage.

31:32.758 --> 31:33.859
I'm trying to deal with it.

31:33.926 --> 31:35.694
By seeking out
people who hurt you?

31:35.761 --> 31:38.197
No! Nothing like that!

31:39.565 --> 31:42.134
I'm in group therapy,
that's all.

31:42.201 --> 31:45.837
I used to be a nice,
easy-going guy.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.040
Hard to believe, huh?

31:53.112 --> 31:55.614
Doctor says he couldn't
lift a cinderblock

31:55.681 --> 31:57.149
or fire a weapon
accurately.

31:57.216 --> 31:59.651
Found no firearms,
no evidence at his house

31:59.718 --> 32:01.087
linked to any
of the crimes.

32:01.153 --> 32:02.754
He's close but
not our guy.

32:02.821 --> 32:04.090
Close?
What do you mean?

32:04.156 --> 32:05.524
Somebody like him,
you know?

32:05.591 --> 32:06.825
More capable or angrier.

32:06.892 --> 32:10.129
Hey, you guys, Charlie's got
something he wants to show us.

32:10.196 --> 32:11.497
Hey, Chuck,
what do you got?

32:11.563 --> 32:13.199
Hey, I've got probable
escape routes

32:13.265 --> 32:14.967
gathered straight
from traffic data.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.268
Now, these red routes

32:16.335 --> 32:18.304
have the highest level
of probability.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.639
Yellow routes,
next highest.

32:20.706 --> 32:22.608
Blue routes,
least likely.

32:22.674 --> 32:23.442
DON:
Okay, good.

32:23.509 --> 32:24.710
Why don't you guys
go check 'em out.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.012
You know, see if you can find
a witness, right?

32:26.078 --> 32:27.279
All right.

32:27.346 --> 32:28.514
Here you go.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.016
Field trip. Love it.

32:30.082 --> 32:32.951
You drive, I'll navigate.

32:34.253 --> 32:36.188
I remember it was
the day of the shooting.

32:36.255 --> 32:38.324
I'd just heard the report
on the radio;

32:38.390 --> 32:41.193
couple minutes later,
this truck blows by.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.129
What made you notice the truck--
was it speeding?

32:43.195 --> 32:44.463
MAN:
No, that's not unusual.

32:44.530 --> 32:45.464
No, it was that, uh,

32:45.531 --> 32:47.899
I see this pickup,
you know, coming up fast,

32:47.966 --> 32:49.801
and then the light goes red.

32:49.868 --> 32:51.270
Wait, wait,
did you say pickup?

32:51.337 --> 32:52.604
Yeah, yeah,
white pickup truck.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.973
MAN:
The light's red, like I said,

32:55.041 --> 32:56.208
and he didn't slow down,

32:56.275 --> 32:58.344
so I figured
he was gonna run it,

32:58.410 --> 33:01.947
and then it goes green again,
after only a couple seconds.

33:02.014 --> 33:03.349
You're sure about that.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.017
It's my job
to watch the light.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.485
Can you describe
the truck--

33:06.552 --> 33:08.520
maybe you got a look
at the driver.

33:08.587 --> 33:11.823
Mm... it was a late-model,
American make, I think.

33:11.890 --> 33:13.592
White, like I said.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.094
I couldn't see
the driver, though.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.696
It was just a white dude
with sunglasses.

33:17.763 --> 33:19.431
Okay.
Anything else?

33:19.498 --> 33:21.967
Maybe there was something
on the dash, possibly.

33:22.034 --> 33:23.669
Well, there was,
now that you mention it.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.337
I couldn't see
what it was, though.

33:25.404 --> 33:28.807
All right,
thank you.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.542
Infamous white pickup.

33:30.609 --> 33:31.410
Sounds like the one

33:31.477 --> 33:32.711
Jeff Kinkirk's son
said he saw

33:32.778 --> 33:34.546
just before he watched
his father get shot.

33:34.613 --> 33:35.781
Yeah, the crossing guard's story

33:35.847 --> 33:36.682
about that light changing--

33:36.748 --> 33:38.184
you thinking
what I'm thinking?

33:38.250 --> 33:39.818
Yeah-- that our killer
somehow figured out

33:39.885 --> 33:40.986
how to tamper with the lights?

33:41.053 --> 33:42.188
Yeah.

33:51.063 --> 33:52.398
Hey, you.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.900
Yeah, aren't you
supposed to be

33:54.966 --> 33:57.403
at the string-theory
symposium at USC?

33:57.469 --> 33:59.938
Now, how do you know
I'm not there?

34:00.005 --> 34:01.540
One of those kinds
of days, is it?

34:01.607 --> 34:04.143
Oh, well, aren't they all?

34:04.210 --> 34:07.613
Larry... is everything
all right?

34:07.679 --> 34:08.714
Everything?

34:08.780 --> 34:10.949
Well, I'm not sure that I can
account for the state

34:11.016 --> 34:12.050
off all matter, but...

34:12.118 --> 34:13.419
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

34:13.485 --> 34:16.422
Stop trying to Fleinhardt
your way around answering me.

34:16.488 --> 34:18.056
What is it, exactly,
that you want to know?

34:18.124 --> 34:19.325
If sleeping
in your office

34:19.391 --> 34:22.294
and missing an event important
to your field of study

34:22.361 --> 34:24.896
constitutes something
that I need to...

34:24.963 --> 34:26.232
be concerned about.

34:26.298 --> 34:27.466
Well, as I previously explained,

34:27.533 --> 34:29.301
I'm sleeping in my office

34:29.368 --> 34:31.237
because I don't wish
the distraction

34:31.303 --> 34:33.972
of finding and furnishing
a residence.

34:34.039 --> 34:35.907
Fine. Fair enough.
The symposium?

34:35.974 --> 34:38.577
I'm hoping to be unavailable,

34:38.644 --> 34:41.613
due to a pressing social
engagement.

34:41.680 --> 34:45.083
You're choosing dinner with
Megan over string theory.

34:45.151 --> 34:46.652
The two are not incompatible.

34:46.718 --> 34:47.519
But thank you.

34:47.586 --> 34:49.788
For what?
For looking after me.

34:49.855 --> 34:50.722
It's so good to know

34:50.789 --> 34:52.791
that if I ever stray
from the rational plane,

34:52.858 --> 34:55.461
you will be there to accost me.

34:55.527 --> 34:58.664
(phone ringing)
Any... anytime.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.332
Hello.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.534
Oh, this modern age.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.671
We think the freeway killer
uses a device like this.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.306
It emits a pulse
of infrared light,

35:07.373 --> 35:09.107
causes traffic lights
to change.

35:09.175 --> 35:11.277
They're legal only
for emergency vehicles.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.345
All right, well,
that explains

35:13.412 --> 35:14.380
he's getting through
traffic, then.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.481
Disrupting
traffic lights

35:15.547 --> 35:17.749
should leave a record in
the system-- times and places.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.418
There's cameras all over
Los Angeles--

35:19.485 --> 35:21.353
on buildings, at intersections,
at ATM machines.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.555
Okay, so we can check
the locations and the times

35:23.622 --> 35:26.124
against the Web cam logs...

35:26.192 --> 35:27.259
Use them to get a photo.

35:27.326 --> 35:28.860
What do you think are
the chances of that, though?

35:28.927 --> 35:31.297
More cameras, better odds.

35:31.363 --> 35:32.564
What do you say, guys?

35:32.631 --> 35:34.900
Hey. All right, so
here's what we got.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.769
We've been through hundreds of
Web cams at intersections

35:37.836 --> 35:40.071
indicated by Charlie's analysis
of traffic light disruptions.

35:40.138 --> 35:44.510
We got this traffic Web cam from
La Brea and the 10 freeway,

35:44.576 --> 35:46.778
at 15 minutes after
attack number nine.

35:46.845 --> 35:50.115
COLBY:
And three seconds before he
drove through that light,

35:50.182 --> 35:51.850
it was hit with
an infrared pulse.

35:51.917 --> 35:52.718
No license visible,

35:52.784 --> 35:54.386
no way to identify
the truck or the driver.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.188
And this? What's this?

35:59.124 --> 36:01.593
Oh, that's some sort of decal.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.961
Pulling together
a lot of string

36:03.028 --> 36:04.930
that the crossing guard witness
saw the killer...

36:04.996 --> 36:07.699
That the guy in this photo is
the one who changed the light.

36:07.766 --> 36:10.236
Maybe you're right-- I mean,
maybe that's our guy.

36:19.645 --> 36:20.712
TECH:
We're getting something.

36:20.779 --> 36:22.714
I'll flip it around
and print it out.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.385
Looks like "HTSU."

36:26.452 --> 36:28.754
"Head Trauma
Survivors United."

36:28.820 --> 36:29.688
Yeah?

36:29.755 --> 36:31.423
Yeah-- Brennon Sommers,
the guy we suspected,

36:31.490 --> 36:33.692
I think he's part of
their Northridge chapter.

36:33.759 --> 36:34.660
There's something on the bottom

36:34.726 --> 36:35.661
of the decal
that's not quite legible.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.128
Well, it could
be Northridge.

36:37.195 --> 36:41.300
Now that would not be
random chance.

36:41.367 --> 36:42.934
COLBY:
So far, we have eight current

36:43.001 --> 36:45.671
and former members who we can
link to freeway attack victims.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.473
Ran the members
through DMV.

36:47.539 --> 36:51.009
Two have white pickups,
one's a 74-year-old lady,

36:51.076 --> 36:52.511
the other is Mitchell McKenzie.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.112
38, he's a home contractor.

36:54.179 --> 36:56.948
McKenzie was in a motorcycle
accident a year ago.

36:57.015 --> 36:58.083
He suffered a head trauma.

36:58.149 --> 37:00.151
Two months after he
joined the support group,

37:00.218 --> 37:01.287
the freeway attacks started.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.688
Well, that must be it, right?

37:02.754 --> 37:04.956
That must be how he's choosing,
is through the support group.

37:05.023 --> 37:06.825
His accident
was a hit and run,

37:06.892 --> 37:08.560
So he's got no target
for all the rage.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.228
He could be acting on behalf
of the other victims.

37:10.296 --> 37:13.699
That's not the kind of support
anybody expected.

37:13.765 --> 37:16.302
Mitchell's close to many
people in the group.

37:16.368 --> 37:17.703
It's common
for trauma victims

37:17.769 --> 37:21.473
to feel like nobody understands
what they've been through,

37:21.540 --> 37:23.174
except other
victims.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.576
And, Dr. Bird, do you discuss

37:24.643 --> 37:26.044
the freeway attacks
in your group?

37:26.111 --> 37:28.847
It's come up in meetings.

37:28.914 --> 37:31.450
I remember I made
a note about it.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.352
What was your note?

37:33.419 --> 37:35.153
Mitchell talks a lot
at meetings,

37:35.220 --> 37:36.322
has an opinion
on everything.

37:36.388 --> 37:41.493
But on the topic
of the freeway attacks...

37:41.560 --> 37:43.094
he's been quiet.

37:43.161 --> 37:46.665
Thank you.

37:46.732 --> 37:48.266
Excuse me.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.404
Eppes.

37:52.471 --> 37:53.905
Don, I think McKenzie
could be the guy.

37:53.972 --> 37:56.007
We just got a hit
on his credit card.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.343
A gas station in Long Beach.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.911
So I got David, Colby
and LAPD on their way.

38:12.891 --> 38:16.428
(siren approaching)

38:29.441 --> 38:30.842
(glass shattering)

38:30.909 --> 38:31.543
Come on, man!

38:31.610 --> 38:32.711
(tires screeching)

38:32.778 --> 38:35.313
(indistinct radio transmission)

38:37.649 --> 38:38.617
(yells)

38:43.822 --> 38:45.357
Come on!

38:47.359 --> 38:49.628
(sirens blaring)

38:52.464 --> 38:53.399
Get out of the way!

38:53.465 --> 38:55.133
Get the hell out of the way.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.935
Get your hands
on the wheel!

38:57.002 --> 38:59.137
You! This way!
Get your hands on the wheel!

38:59.204 --> 39:02.674
(indistinct shouting)

39:02.741 --> 39:04.676
I'm only trying
to do what's right!

39:04.743 --> 39:07.713
Innocent people hurt and killed!

39:07.779 --> 39:11.116
And those responsible
just walk away!

39:13.985 --> 39:15.521
Somebody has to pay.

39:15.587 --> 39:19.758
That's all I do.
I make things right.

39:21.427 --> 39:22.761
I make things right.

39:42.448 --> 39:44.049
What are you sitting
in the dark for?

39:44.115 --> 39:45.383
Just thinking.

39:45.451 --> 39:48.454
Thank God you caught
that guy, huh?

39:48.520 --> 39:50.622
Five deaths, six people injured.

39:50.689 --> 39:53.525
And tomorrow I got

39:53.592 --> 39:55.060
12 new cases.

39:55.126 --> 39:57.463
Yeah, you're having a lot
of tough ones lately.

39:57.529 --> 40:00.599
Maybe you should think
of taking some time off.

40:00.666 --> 40:03.168
Yeah, don't
I wish.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.471
Donny, it's not good
for you to get this way.

40:05.537 --> 40:07.773
Oh, Dad, what are you talking
about? This is the way I am.

40:07.839 --> 40:09.074
No, no, Listen to me. Donny...

40:09.140 --> 40:11.076
Look, it's just, you know,
sometimes...

40:11.142 --> 40:12.077
(door opens)

40:12.143 --> 40:13.812
Hello.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.681
Hey, Don.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.015
Glad you're here.

40:17.082 --> 40:18.684
Found something interesting
that I want you to look at.

40:18.750 --> 40:19.685
Oh, yeah? What's that?

40:19.751 --> 40:20.886
You know
how I thought

40:20.952 --> 40:23.489
that all the freeway attacks
were a random series?

40:23.555 --> 40:24.823
Yeah.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.725
They weren't. They weren't.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.794
Because, yeah, McKenzie was
behind all of them,

40:28.860 --> 40:31.296
but he didn't actually
start the sequence.

40:31.362 --> 40:32.964
What are you talking about?

40:33.031 --> 40:35.033
A hit and run driver
started the sequence

40:35.100 --> 40:36.535
when he hit McKenzie.

40:36.602 --> 40:38.436
The head injury
the McKenzie sustained

40:38.504 --> 40:41.139
left him unable to control his
impulses, control his rage...

40:41.206 --> 40:43.441
Oh, come on, Charlie,
the man is still responsible

40:43.509 --> 40:44.510
for his actions.

40:44.576 --> 40:45.844
Yeah, of course.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.946
Except that the guy that hit
McKenzie was never apprehended.

40:48.013 --> 40:49.915
He totally got
away with it.

40:49.981 --> 40:52.150
What, is this
his accident report?
Yeah, Megan called

40:52.217 --> 40:53.251
the CHP for me, and I just...

40:53.318 --> 40:56.221
I thought it was something
you might want to look at.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.789
Yeah, I think I see
where you're headed.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.424
What? We got
his tire treads,

40:59.491 --> 41:01.126
paint and metal...

41:01.192 --> 41:02.360
Yeah, there's tons
of information.

41:02.427 --> 41:03.428
I mean, I can help
you with this.

41:03.495 --> 41:04.663
DON:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:04.730 --> 41:07.465
Yeah, Charlie.
This is good.

41:07.533 --> 41:09.134
There's enough
information.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.702
You got a pen?
Yeah.

41:10.769 --> 41:13.471
We can narrow down
the suspect list.
