00:29.320 --> 00:35.201
When the child was a child,
it walked with its arms swinging.

00:35.410 --> 00:40.123
It wanted the stream to be a river,
the river a torrent...

00:40.331 --> 00:44.419
and this puddle to be the sea.

00:44.627 --> 00:49.090
When the child was a child,
it didn't know it was a child.

00:49.299 --> 00:54.679
Everything was full of life,
and all life was one.

00:54.888 --> 00:59.684
When the child was a child,
it had no opinion about anything.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.269
It had no habits.

01:01.478 --> 01:05.397
It often sat cross-legged,
took off running...

01:05.607 --> 01:10.612
had a cowlick in its hair,
and didn't pull a face...

01:10.820 --> 01:12.614
when photographed.

03:11.649 --> 03:13.026
Look.

03:26.539 --> 03:31.920
The consolation of lifting one's head
out here in the open...

03:32.128 --> 03:36.091
of seeing the colours
enlightened by the sun...

03:36.299 --> 03:39.344
in all men's eyes.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.348
At last mad, no longer alone.

03:43.556 --> 03:48.353
At last mad, at last redeemed.
At last mad, at last at peace.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.855
At last an internal light.

03:51.064 --> 03:56.236
We're approaching Berlin Tegel, the
no-smoking sign has been turned on.

03:56.444 --> 04:00.824
Please stop smoking
until you're inside the airport.

04:15.922 --> 04:22.053
There's a little house
with two floors and a terrace.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.724
And every day we go bathing.

04:25.932 --> 04:29.060
The man who lives there
is called Peter...

04:49.706 --> 04:51.166
Pretty picture.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.429
Nothing good to see on TV.

06:30.306 --> 06:34.728
You stumble over your colours,
and are never punctual.

06:47.365 --> 06:52.245
Still the same smell. But dustier.
She collected everything.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.123
Stamps, postcards.

06:55.290 --> 07:01.254
Even U-Bahn tickets.
She never threw anything away.

07:01.463 --> 07:06.092
Mother. My mother.
She never was.

07:06.301 --> 07:09.846
My father...
My father was my father.

07:10.055 --> 07:15.810
She is dead.
No tears, no grief. Maybe later.

07:16.019 --> 07:21.649
Dependant on everybody.
My sister. I have to get out of here.

07:46.007 --> 07:50.679
She's never loved me.
And you also just pretend.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.556
Be glad that they forgot about you.

07:53.723 --> 07:57.894
Want to die immediately,
don't want to go on living.

08:02.357 --> 08:08.697
My God, what will become of the boy?
He's only got music on his mind.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.870
What does he want now?

08:16.079 --> 08:21.501
I already bought him a guitar.
Does he wants drums now?

08:24.713 --> 08:30.677
I'm slowly getting fed up with it.
Won't he ever grow up?

08:32.095 --> 08:38.101
No really, I'm getting fed up.
I don't want to go on with this.

08:38.308 --> 08:45.275
No really, this has to stop some time.
I can't help him any more.

08:46.818 --> 08:50.905
No wonder, he only learnt rock 'n' roll.

08:51.114 --> 08:56.119
Maybe he'll get a grip on himself
one day.

09:06.671 --> 09:13.136
When the child was a child,
it was the time of these questions:

09:13.345 --> 09:18.058
Why am I me, and why not you?

09:18.266 --> 09:22.979
Why am I here, and why not there?

09:23.188 --> 09:28.401
When did time begin,
and where does space end?

09:28.610 --> 09:32.822
Isn't life under the sun
just a dream?

09:35.325 --> 09:42.207
Isn't what I see, hear and smell just a
mirage of the world before the world?

09:42.415 --> 09:48.004
Does evil actually exist,
and people who are really evil?

09:49.631 --> 09:57.631
How can it be that I, the one I am,
wasn't there before I was there...

09:58.098 --> 10:05.772
and that some time I, the one I am,
no longer will be the one I am?

10:10.944 --> 10:14.656
The child needs oxygen.
Breathe deep down.

10:14.864 --> 10:18.076
If I could only suffer in her place.
- It hurts.

10:18.284 --> 10:23.540
It'll be over soon.
- It's almost over.

10:23.748 --> 10:30.338
Poor little mite, I'm anxious to see you.
I wonder what you look like.

10:30.547 --> 10:36.636
You bastard. You bastard.
- Women will fuck up your life.

10:36.845 --> 10:42.684
Blackie, I think I got lost.
We wanted to go to the cemetery...

11:13.548 --> 11:14.924
Well?

11:22.098 --> 11:28.021
Sunrise at 7.22 am, sunset at 4.28 pm.
Moonrise at 7.04 pm, moonset...

11:28.229 --> 11:30.774
Level of the Havel and the Spree...

11:30.982 --> 11:36.780
20 years ago today, a Soviet jet fighter
crashed into the lakes at Spandau.

11:36.988 --> 11:41.076
50 years ago, there were...
- The Olympic Games.

11:42.202 --> 11:47.207
200 years ago,
the first balloon flew over the city.

11:47.540 --> 11:51.711
Like the fugitives the other day.
- And today...

11:51.920 --> 11:55.382
A man slows down...

11:55.590 --> 11:59.219
and looks over his shoulder
into space.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.765
Someone who wants
to put an end to it...

12:03.973 --> 12:06.935
put first-issue stamps
on his farewell letters.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.520
A different one on each.

12:08.728 --> 12:13.566
Then he spoke English
with an American soldier...

12:13.775 --> 12:17.987
for the first time since his schooldays,
fluently.

12:19.114 --> 12:25.578
Just before dashing his head against
the wall, a prisoner said: "Now."

12:25.787 --> 12:29.332
Instead of the station's name,
the guard...

12:29.541 --> 12:33.294
- "Tierra del Fuego."
- Nice.

12:33.503 --> 12:36.798
An old man was reading
the Odyssey to a child...

12:37.007 --> 12:42.012
and the young listener
stopped blinking his eyes.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.723
And what do you have to tell?

12:46.850 --> 12:54.065
A passer-by who, in the rain,
folded her umbrella and was drenched.

12:55.608 --> 13:01.573
A schoolboy who described
to his teacher a fern growing...

13:01.781 --> 13:04.284
and the astounded teacher.

13:05.952 --> 13:11.166
A blind woman, who groped her watch,
feeling my presence.

13:13.376 --> 13:16.880
It's great to live by the spirit,
to testify for eternity...

13:17.088 --> 13:20.759
only what is spiritual
in people's minds.

13:22.510 --> 13:26.181
But sometimes I'm fed up
with my spiritual existence...

13:26.389 --> 13:28.350
of forever hovering above.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.977
I'd like to feel a weight in me...

13:31.186 --> 13:34.814
to end the infinity,
and to tie me to earth.

13:35.023 --> 13:39.027
I'd like at each step,
each gust of wind...

13:39.235 --> 13:42.947
"Now, now and now."

13:43.156 --> 13:45.867
"Forever" and "For eternity".

13:46.076 --> 13:50.914
Sit at the empty place at a card table,
be greeted...

13:51.122 --> 13:53.291
even by a nod.

13:54.793 --> 13:58.713
Every time we participated,
it was a pretence.

13:59.839 --> 14:04.511
Wrestling, allowing a hip to be put out,
in pretence...

14:04.719 --> 14:07.055
catching a fish in pretence.

14:07.263 --> 14:12.769
In pretence, sitting at tables
drinking and eating in pretence.

14:12.977 --> 14:18.191
Having lambs roasted and wine served
in the tents in the desert...

14:18.400 --> 14:20.276
only in pretence.

14:20.485 --> 14:25.156
I don't have to beget a child
or plant a tree...

14:25.365 --> 14:29.911
but it would be nice,
coming home after a long day...

14:30.120 --> 14:34.040
to feed the cat like Philip Marlowe...

14:34.249 --> 14:38.753
to have a fever,
blackened fingers from the newspaper.

14:40.630 --> 14:44.843
To be excited not only by the mind,
but by a meal.

14:45.969 --> 14:50.015
By the line of a neck,
by an ear.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.269
To lie.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.771
Through one's teeth.

14:56.980 --> 15:00.775
As you're walking,
to feel your bones moving along.

15:00.984 --> 15:04.279
At last to guess
instead of always knowing.

15:04.487 --> 15:09.659
"Ah" and "Oh" and "Hey"...

15:09.868 --> 15:13.538
- "Yes and amen."
- Yes.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.916
To be able to enthuse for evil...

15:17.125 --> 15:21.004
to draw all the demons
from the passers-by...

15:21.212 --> 15:24.215
and to chase them out into the world.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.718
To be a savage.

15:28.470 --> 15:33.475
Or to feel how it is to take off
your shoes under the table...

15:33.683 --> 15:38.605
and to wriggle your toes, barefoot,
like that...

15:42.442 --> 15:44.319
Stay alone.

15:44.527 --> 15:48.198
Let things happen. Keep serious.

15:48.406 --> 15:53.286
We can only be savages
in as much as we keep serious.

15:53.495 --> 15:58.625
Do no more than look.
Assemble, testify, preserve.

16:00.877 --> 16:05.507
Remain spirit.
Keep your distance. Keep your word.

16:05.715 --> 16:10.303
Look, a convertible.
You don't buy that, you steal it.

16:10.512 --> 16:12.889
Or it's stolen from you.
- Imagine...

16:13.098 --> 16:17.394
Open the roof, leave the smog behind.
- In a pimpmobile.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.769
Tell me, muse, the storyteller...

21:09.978 --> 21:14.065
he who has been thrust
to the edge of the world...

21:14.274 --> 21:21.448
both an infant and an ancient,
and through him reveal Everyman.

21:30.498 --> 21:36.087
With time, those who listened to me
became my readers.

21:36.296 --> 21:40.050
They no longer sit in a circle,
but apart...

21:40.258 --> 21:44.179
and one doesn't know anything
about the other.

21:50.685 --> 21:54.731
I'm an old man,
with a broken voice...

21:54.939 --> 22:00.028
but the story
still rises from the depths...

22:00.236 --> 22:03.031
and the slowly opened mouth...

22:03.239 --> 22:07.619
repeats it as clearly
as it does powerfully.

22:07.827 --> 22:13.541
A liturgy for which no one
needs to be initiated...

22:13.750 --> 22:18.171
to the meaning
of the words and sentences.

22:27.514 --> 22:32.352
Maybe she doesn't have the money
to see another doctor.

22:34.229 --> 22:37.774
4 years since I saw her,
she's been sick for 2.

22:37.982 --> 22:42.862
When will you pray with your
own words, and not for eternal life?

22:43.071 --> 22:48.618
And then these young girls
make eyes at men...

22:48.827 --> 22:52.914
So why am I living? Why am I living?

22:59.629 --> 23:02.882
How will I pay?
With my small pension.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.398
You're lost,
it can go on for a long time.

23:18.606 --> 23:21.359
Abandoned by parents,
betrayed by wife.

23:21.568 --> 23:25.822
Friend in another town,
your children only recall your stutter.

23:26.031 --> 23:30.410
You could hit yourself
as you look in the mirror.

23:30.618 --> 23:35.373
What's that?
What's going on?

23:35.582 --> 23:40.128
I'm still there.
If I want it, if I only want it.

23:41.546 --> 23:45.216
I must want it,
then I can get out of it again.

23:45.425 --> 23:48.762
I let myself go,
I can drag myself out again.

23:48.970 --> 23:51.639
Of course, mother was right.

24:02.942 --> 24:06.154
Hey, two Marks.
- No, it's a beer top.

24:06.363 --> 24:08.490
Nonsense, let's pull it up.

24:13.328 --> 24:14.704
Only 10 Pfennigs.

24:16.414 --> 24:22.045
" You bet?" was great last night.
- It wasn't on last night.

24:22.253 --> 24:25.215
A few days ago, or a month...

24:28.051 --> 24:33.139
I'm all alone,
just mad on my own...

24:33.348 --> 24:37.894
three at play,
that'll be the day.

24:47.237 --> 24:52.492
5 years ago.
- And they lived happily ever after.

25:13.013 --> 25:16.599
Marion, not like that. Mon dieu.

25:16.808 --> 25:22.480
What is this?
With a swing, not with force.

25:22.689 --> 25:26.651
What are you doing?
Don't dangle, fly.

25:26.860 --> 25:31.072
You are an angel.
- For heaven's sake.

25:32.365 --> 25:35.118
And for my sake, too.

25:35.326 --> 25:39.622
I can't fly with these things.
- Yes, you can.

25:39.831 --> 25:45.837
It's easier with wings than without.
- Not with these chicken feathers.

25:46.963 --> 25:50.884
What did she say?
- These wings bother her.

25:53.636 --> 26:01.561
Marion, just imagine you're a dove.
- You bunch of sparrows.

26:02.687 --> 26:07.025
What are you playing at?
Sounds like a firemen's ball.

26:07.233 --> 26:12.072
That's enough.
Concentrate, Marion.

26:12.280 --> 26:15.367
She works hard
with those chicken feathers.

26:15.575 --> 26:20.121
Marion, make an effort.
- Make an effort.

26:20.330 --> 26:25.085
Of course, I make an effort.
What do you think I'm doing?

26:26.753 --> 26:32.175
I'd have fallen on your heads long ago,
if I didn't make an effort.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.392
One moment, please.

26:41.643 --> 26:46.773
Hold everything. We can't pay the rent
and the electricity.

26:46.981 --> 26:48.358
We're broke.

26:49.818 --> 26:56.324
So tomorrow we'll take things down,
pull the caravans to winter quarters.

26:56.533 --> 27:02.414
The bailiff's been.
This is it for the circus this year.

27:02.622 --> 27:04.332
I'm sorry.

27:04.541 --> 27:07.836
It's over. Not even a season.

27:08.044 --> 27:12.257
Once again,
no time to bring something to an end.

27:12.465 --> 27:17.220
Tonight the last night
of my good old number.

27:17.429 --> 27:19.180
And it's a full moon.

27:19.389 --> 27:24.477
And the trapeze artist
comes tumbling down...

27:24.686 --> 27:26.896
Tais-toi. Be quiet.

27:27.105 --> 27:33.361
I never imagined it like that,
the farewell to the circus.

27:35.488 --> 27:39.951
The last evening, no one shows up,
you play like fools...

27:40.160 --> 27:44.539
and I fly around the ring
like a poor chicken.

27:45.957 --> 27:52.881
And then I'm a waitress again.
Merde.

27:54.841 --> 27:58.803
Moments like that,
like right now...

27:59.012 --> 28:02.766
a beautiful memory
in 10 years time.

28:02.974 --> 28:09.439
Time will heal everything,
but what if time was the illness?

28:09.647 --> 28:13.985
As if sometimes one had to lean over
to go on living.

28:14.194 --> 28:18.948
To live... A look is enough.

28:19.157 --> 28:21.910
The circus... I'll miss it.

28:22.118 --> 28:26.581
It's funny.
It's the end, and I don't feel a thing.

28:26.790 --> 28:28.500
An angel passes by.

28:28.708 --> 28:32.504
I must stop
having a bad conscience.

28:38.301 --> 28:41.471
As if pain had no past.

28:41.680 --> 28:44.849
It always stops
when it's only just starting...

28:45.058 --> 28:48.228
to be too good to be true.

28:48.436 --> 28:51.022
At last outside, in the city.

28:51.231 --> 28:56.152
Find out who I am,
who I have become.

28:56.361 --> 29:01.157
Most of the time,
I'm too aware to be sad.

29:01.366 --> 29:07.414
I waited an eternity
to hear a loving word.

29:07.622 --> 29:09.833
Then I went abroad.

29:10.041 --> 29:15.255
" I love you so much today."

29:16.381 --> 29:20.260
That would be wonderful.

29:20.468 --> 29:26.433
I look up and the world
appears before my eyes...

29:26.641 --> 29:29.436
and fills my heart.

29:32.564 --> 29:37.777
As a child,
I wanted to live on an island.

29:39.320 --> 29:44.034
A woman alone, gloriously alone.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.204
Yes, that's it.

30:01.634 --> 30:05.096
Everything so empty, incompatible.

30:05.305 --> 30:09.267
Emptiness, fear.

30:09.476 --> 30:13.104
La peur, la peur, la peur...

30:13.313 --> 30:14.689
Fear.

30:19.694 --> 30:23.865
Like a small animal,
lost in the woods.

30:24.074 --> 30:26.951
Who are you?
I don't know any more.

30:27.160 --> 30:32.749
I will no longer be a trapeze artist.

30:40.965 --> 30:44.511
Must not cry. That's how it is.

30:44.719 --> 30:49.599
It happens,
not always as you'd like it.

30:49.808 --> 30:54.104
Emptiness, such emptiness...

31:42.694 --> 31:44.571
What shall I do?

31:47.782 --> 31:52.287
Not think any more.
Just be there.

31:53.621 --> 31:58.835
Berlin... Here I'm a stranger,
and yet it's all so familiar.

31:59.044 --> 32:04.049
You can't get lost,
you always end up at the Wall.

32:04.257 --> 32:10.722
I'm waiting for my photo at a machine,
and it comes out with another face.

32:10.930 --> 32:14.601
That could be the beginning of a story.

32:14.809 --> 32:19.272
The faces... I'd like to see faces.

32:19.481 --> 32:22.734
Maybe I'll find a job as a waitress.

32:34.621 --> 32:37.540
This evening scares me.

32:37.749 --> 32:41.294
It's silly, fear makes me sick.

32:41.503 --> 32:46.925
Only part of me worries,
the other part doesn't believe in it.

32:50.845 --> 32:56.518
How should I live?
Maybe that's not the question.

32:56.726 --> 32:59.437
How should I think?

33:05.068 --> 33:11.324
I know so little. Maybe
because I'm always just curious.

33:11.533 --> 33:13.827
Sometimes I think so wrongly...

33:14.035 --> 33:19.249
because I'm thinking
as if I was talking to someone else.

33:23.920 --> 33:29.300
Inside closed eyes,
close the eyes again.

33:30.427 --> 33:33.304
Then even the stones come alive.

34:12.677 --> 34:15.347
To be with the colours.

34:15.554 --> 34:18.891
Les couleurs. The colours.

34:21.686 --> 34:28.068
Neon lights in the evening sky,
the red and yellow S-Bahn.

34:32.947 --> 34:37.827
Longing... longing.

34:38.036 --> 34:41.414
I only need to be ready.

34:42.748 --> 34:47.670
Longing for a wave of love
that would stir in me.

34:50.882 --> 34:57.263
That's what makes me clumsy,
the absence of desire.

35:03.853 --> 35:06.648
Desire to love.

35:15.281 --> 35:18.118
Desire to love.

36:04.581 --> 36:08.668
Don't stare.
Have you never seen anyone die?

36:08.877 --> 36:14.215
I stink of gasoline.
I can't just... It was all so clear.

36:14.424 --> 36:18.178
The way they're standing there,
staring at me.

36:18.386 --> 36:22.766
I should have told her yesterday
that I'm sorry...

36:22.974 --> 36:28.897
I can't simply...
I've still got so much to do...

36:29.105 --> 36:34.027
As I came up the mountain
out of the misty valley into the sun...

36:36.780 --> 36:42.035
The fire on the cattle range,
the potatoes in the ashes...

36:43.370 --> 36:46.915
the boathouse floating on the lake.

36:47.123 --> 36:52.462
The Southern Cross. The Far East.

36:52.671 --> 36:59.469
The Great North. The Wild West.

36:59.678 --> 37:07.602
The Great Bear Lake.
The Tristan de Cunha Island.

37:08.937 --> 37:15.735
The Mississippi Delta. Stromboli.

37:17.445 --> 37:24.285
The old houses of Charlottenburg.
Albert Camus.

37:26.538 --> 37:33.253
The morning light.
The eyes of the child.

37:35.005 --> 37:38.466
Swimming near the waterfall.

37:40.093 --> 37:46.683
The spots of the first drops of rain.
The sun.

37:46.891 --> 37:53.064
The bread and wine. Hopping.

37:53.273 --> 37:59.195
Easter. The veins of the leaves.

37:59.404 --> 38:05.869
The blowing grass.
The colours of the stones.

38:06.077 --> 38:10.790
The pebbles on the stream's bed.

38:10.999 --> 38:14.669
The white tablecloth outdoors.

38:14.878 --> 38:18.840
The dream of the house in the house.

38:19.049 --> 38:23.219
The dear one asleep
in the next room.

38:23.428 --> 38:29.351
The peaceful Sunday.
The horizon.

38:29.559 --> 38:33.730
The light from the room
in the garden.

38:33.938 --> 38:40.195
The night flight.
Riding a bicycle with no hands.

38:41.905 --> 38:44.449
The beautiful stranger.

38:45.867 --> 38:47.243
My father.

38:49.454 --> 38:50.830
My mother.

38:53.083 --> 38:54.459
My wife.

38:56.795 --> 38:58.171
My child.

39:15.146 --> 39:20.026
The world seems to be sinking
into dust, but I recount...

39:20.235 --> 39:22.028
as in the beginning...

39:22.237 --> 39:25.865
in my sing-song voice,
which sustains me...

39:26.074 --> 39:30.453
saved by the tale
from present troubles...

39:30.662 --> 39:34.624
and protected for the future.

39:48.471 --> 39:54.561
Finished with the sweeping
over the centuries as in the past.

39:54.769 --> 39:59.524
Now I can think only day by day.

39:59.733 --> 40:05.613
My heroes are no longer
the warriors and kings...

40:05.822 --> 40:12.787
but the things of peace,
one equal to the other.

40:12.996 --> 40:20.420
The drying onions equal
to the tree trunk crossing the marsh.

40:20.628 --> 40:28.628
But no one has so far succeeded
in singing an epic of peace.

40:29.095 --> 40:35.101
What is wrong with peace
that its inspiration doesn't endure...

40:35.310 --> 40:41.608
and that its story is hardly told?

40:46.029 --> 40:49.157
Must I give up now?

40:49.366 --> 40:54.579
If I do give up,
then mankind will lose its storyteller.

40:54.788 --> 40:58.958
And once mankind
loses its storyteller...

40:59.167 --> 41:03.046
it will also lose its childhood.

41:12.847 --> 41:18.228
I cannot find the Potsdamer Platz.

41:20.480 --> 41:26.861
Here? This can't be it.

41:27.070 --> 41:32.867
Potsdamer Platz,
that's where Cafz Josti used to be.

41:33.076 --> 41:40.041
In the afternoons, I went there
to chat and to drink a coffee...

41:40.250 --> 41:42.168
and to watch the crowd.

41:42.377 --> 41:46.297
Before that I smoked my cigar
at Loese and Wolf...

41:46.506 --> 41:49.968
a renowned tobacconist.

41:50.176 --> 41:52.178
Just across from here.

41:53.304 --> 42:00.186
This can't be the Potsdamer Platz.

42:01.438 --> 42:07.360
And no one whom you can ask.

42:09.029 --> 42:17.029
It was a lively place.
Tramways, horse-drawn carriages...

42:17.412 --> 42:24.294
mine and that of the chocolate shop.

42:25.712 --> 42:30.258
The Wertheim store was here, too.

42:30.467 --> 42:37.307
And then suddenly,
the flags appeared.

42:37.515 --> 42:39.309
Here...

42:40.727 --> 42:45.648
The whole Platz
was covered with them.

42:45.857 --> 42:51.488
And the people
weren't friendly anymore...

42:51.696 --> 42:55.825
and the police wasn't either.

42:56.034 --> 42:59.954
I will not give up...

43:00.163 --> 43:05.335
as long as I haven't found
the Potsdamer Platz.

43:10.423 --> 43:15.095
Where are my heroes?
Where are you, my children?

43:15.303 --> 43:20.350
Where are my own, the dull-witted...

43:20.558 --> 43:22.560
the original ones?

43:32.153 --> 43:37.033
Name me, muse,
the immortal singer...

43:37.242 --> 43:41.913
who,
abandoned by his mortal audience...

43:42.122 --> 43:43.623
lost his voice.

43:43.832 --> 43:46.835
He who,
from angel of poetry that he was...

43:47.043 --> 43:52.632
became the organ grinder
ignored or mocked...

43:52.841 --> 43:57.137
outside,
on the threshold of no man's land.

44:20.869 --> 44:27.834
20 Marks, 40 Marks, 80 Marks.
In a week I could have 500.

44:28.043 --> 44:30.253
Off to the south.

44:30.462 --> 44:34.049
What a crazy idea to stand here.
Too much traffic.

44:34.257 --> 44:37.218
Idiot,
three times he's been this way.

44:37.427 --> 44:40.180
I want to get out of here.

44:40.388 --> 44:45.352
If anyone recognises me, I'll be
thrown out of secondary school.

44:45.560 --> 44:49.314
I need Klaus,
he'd take good care of me.

44:49.522 --> 44:54.611
He was so good, too good.
And now he's dead.

45:03.787 --> 45:07.457
Are there still borders?
More than ever.

45:07.665 --> 45:13.254
Each street has its own border line.

45:13.463 --> 45:16.966
Between each plot
there's a no man's land strip...

45:17.175 --> 45:20.929
hidden by a hedge or by a ditch.

45:21.137 --> 45:24.724
Who dares,
will fall on booby traps...

45:24.933 --> 45:27.852
or be hit by laser beams.

45:28.061 --> 45:32.774
The trout in the water
are really torpedoes.

45:32.982 --> 45:37.070
Every proprietor, or even tenant...

45:37.278 --> 45:40.031
sticks up his nameplate
like a coat of arms...

45:40.240 --> 45:43.284
and studies the paper
like a world leader.

45:43.493 --> 45:48.415
The German people are divided into as
many states as there are individuals.

45:48.623 --> 45:52.252
And these small states are mobile.

45:52.460 --> 45:54.629
Each one takes his own with him...

45:54.838 --> 45:58.675
and demands a toll
when another wants to enter.

45:58.883 --> 46:05.557
In the form of a fly in amber
or a leather bottle.

46:05.765 --> 46:07.517
So much for the border.

46:07.726 --> 46:13.815
But one can only enter each state
with the right passwords.

46:33.668 --> 46:37.964
Today's German soul can only
be conquered and governed...

46:38.173 --> 46:42.677
by he who arrives at each small state
with the password.

46:42.886 --> 46:46.348
Fortunately,
no one is now able to do so.

46:46.556 --> 46:53.313
So everyone migrates and
raises his own flag all over the world.

46:53.521 --> 46:56.066
Even their children
shake their rattles...

46:56.274 --> 46:59.652
and trail their filth around
in circles.

51:19.704 --> 51:21.706
The medals reflect the best.

51:21.915 --> 51:24.918
They were elegant,
those brothers.

51:25.126 --> 51:27.837
Could I have light?
- But no flame.

51:28.046 --> 51:30.340
You're welcome.
- Thank you.

51:32.342 --> 51:36.137
The only thing I shall miss
from the outside...

51:36.346 --> 51:40.600
from the realm of light,
will be sparrows.

51:40.809 --> 51:43.561
Money buys happiness.
How to live?

51:43.770 --> 51:46.564
The Man in the Golden Helmet
is a swindle.

51:46.773 --> 51:51.194
You're not natives,
you're all refugees.

51:51.403 --> 51:53.905
You're wet from swimming.

51:54.114 --> 51:57.742
I've been sitting here
since this morning...

51:57.951 --> 51:59.828
I'm so cold and bored.

52:00.036 --> 52:04.249
Wind in the face,
the first snow in the air.

52:04.499 --> 52:06.584
Water in the gutter.

52:06.793 --> 52:09.879
The balcony
with the beautiful stranger.

52:10.088 --> 52:14.926
Real ones. They look like it.
They could be real ones.

52:15.135 --> 52:18.388
Some stole food from the dogs
in the camps.

52:18.596 --> 52:24.352
That would take the grin off your face.
Don't be too sure yet.

52:24.561 --> 52:28.857
The Frenchman.
I met him in the streets.

52:29.065 --> 52:33.820
" Berlin won't be there any more,"
Constant said.

52:34.029 --> 52:40.660
The house was half gone.
Some of it still stood. For how long?

52:40.869 --> 52:43.288
Yes, I can still see this woman...

52:43.496 --> 52:50.920
who was standing up there
in the ruins shaking the duvet.

52:51.129 --> 52:56.217
When was that?
May... June 1945.

53:19.908 --> 53:24.829
Is he good at what he's doing?
It seems so.

53:42.389 --> 53:46.935
I'd like to see it.
Maybe he'll give it to me.

55:49.265 --> 55:52.102
Come, I'll show you something else.

57:27.280 --> 57:33.119
When the child was a child
it choked on spinach, peas...

57:33.328 --> 57:36.748
rice pudding
and steamed cauliflower...

57:36.956 --> 57:41.628
and now eats all of that,
and not just because it has to.

57:41.836 --> 57:46.883
When the child was a child,
it woke up once in a strange bed...

57:47.092 --> 57:49.344
but now time and time again.

57:49.552 --> 57:55.141
Many people seemed beautiful then,
nowadays it's only the odd one.

57:55.350 --> 58:02.023
It had a precise picture of Paradise,
and now can only guess at it.

58:02.232 --> 58:08.029
It couldn't imagine nothingness,
and today shudders at the idea.

58:08.238 --> 58:12.951
When the child was a child,
it played with enthusiasm...

58:13.159 --> 58:20.500
and now it can only muster it
when it concerns its work.

01:01:19.179 --> 01:01:21.848
Do you recall our first visit here?

01:01:22.057 --> 01:01:25.685
History had not yet begun.

01:01:25.894 --> 01:01:30.023
We let mornings and evenings go by,
and waited.

01:01:30.231 --> 01:01:36.905
It took a long time for the river to find
its bed and the stagnant water to flow.

01:01:37.113 --> 01:01:43.161
Valley of the primeval river.
One day, I still remember...

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:47.957
the glacier melted
and the icebergs drifted to the north.

01:01:48.166 --> 01:01:53.505
A tree passed by, still green,
with an empty bird's nest.

01:01:53.672 --> 01:01:57.759
Only the fish had leapt
over a myriad of years.

01:01:57.967 --> 01:02:01.471
Then came the moment
when the bees drowned.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.351
Some time later,
the two stags fought on the bank.

01:02:06.643 --> 01:02:12.774
Then the flies and the antlers,
like branches, flowing down the river.

01:02:12.982 --> 01:02:15.318
All that ever grew again was grass...

01:02:15.527 --> 01:02:20.073
growing over the bodies of wild cats,
wild boar and buffaloes.

01:02:20.281 --> 01:02:25.995
One morning, out of the savannah,
its forehead smeared with grass...

01:02:26.204 --> 01:02:30.458
appeared the biped,
our image, so long awaited.

01:02:30.667 --> 01:02:32.961
And its first word was a shout.

01:02:33.169 --> 01:02:40.093
Was it "ah" or "oh",
or was it merely a groan?

01:02:40.301 --> 01:02:45.432
We were at last able to laugh,
for the first time.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:51.146
Through this man's shout and that
of his followers, we learnt to speak.

01:02:51.354 --> 01:02:53.565
A long story.

01:02:53.773 --> 01:02:55.900
Sun, lightning, thunder in the sky...

01:02:56.109 --> 01:02:59.738
and below on earth,
the firesides, the leaps...

01:02:59.946 --> 01:03:03.408
the round dances,
the signs, the writing.

01:03:05.535 --> 01:03:10.040
Then one broke through the cycle
and ran straight ahead.

01:03:10.248 --> 01:03:17.088
As long as he ran straight ahead,
swerving sometimes perhaps from joy...

01:03:17.297 --> 01:03:21.051
he seemed free,
and again we could laugh with him.

01:03:21.259 --> 01:03:26.973
But then, suddenly, he ran zigzag,
and stones flew.

01:03:29.976 --> 01:03:35.815
With his flight began
the history of wars. It is still going on.

01:03:36.024 --> 01:03:41.363
But the story of the grass, the sun,
the leaps and the shouts...

01:03:41.571 --> 01:03:44.074
is still going on, too.

01:03:50.205 --> 01:03:54.459
Do you know how one day
the road was built here...

01:03:54.668 --> 01:03:59.005
which the next day
saw the Napoleon retreat...

01:03:59.214 --> 01:04:03.426
and was paved later on?

01:04:03.635 --> 01:04:09.849
Today it is covered with grass
and sunk in like a Roman road...

01:04:10.058 --> 01:04:12.227
with the tank tracks.

01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:18.900
But we weren't even spectators.
We've always been too few.

01:04:24.739 --> 01:04:31.162
You really want...
- To conquer a history for myself.

01:04:31.371 --> 01:04:34.582
What my timeless downward look
has taught me...

01:04:34.791 --> 01:04:38.378
I want to transmute,
to sustain a glance...

01:04:38.586 --> 01:04:42.924
a short shout, a sour smell.

01:04:44.009 --> 01:04:48.847
I've been outside long enough.
Absent long enough.

01:04:49.055 --> 01:04:53.560
Long enough out of the world.
Let me enter the history of the world.

01:04:53.768 --> 01:04:56.521
Or just hold an apple in my hand.

01:04:56.730 --> 01:05:02.068
Look, those feathers,
there on the water, already vanished.

01:05:02.277 --> 01:05:09.576
Look, the tyre marks on the asphalt,
and now the cigarette butt rolling.

01:05:09.784 --> 01:05:15.957
The primeval river has dried up,
and only today's raindrops still quiver.

01:05:16.166 --> 01:05:19.836
Down with the world behind the world.

01:06:43.461 --> 01:06:46.631
Only the Roman roads
still lead somewhere...

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:50.719
only the oldest traces
lead anywhere.

01:06:50.927 --> 01:06:53.388
Where is the top of the pass here?

01:06:53.596 --> 01:06:59.728
Even the plains, even Berlin,
has its hidden passes.

01:06:59.936 --> 01:07:06.776
And it's only there that my country,
the country of the tale, begins.

01:07:06.985 --> 01:07:11.114
Why doesn't everyone see
from childhood on...

01:07:11.322 --> 01:07:15.744
the passes, doors and crevices...

01:07:15.952 --> 01:07:20.081
on the ground
and above in the sky.

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:27.714
If everyone saw them, there would be
history without murder or war.

01:07:27.922 --> 01:07:32.302
This time I'm doing it.
Funny I'm so calm.

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:36.639
Why red socks with black shoes?
Stupid.

01:07:36.848 --> 01:07:40.518
Foggy, cold.
Put on a pullover, afraid to be cold.

01:07:40.727 --> 01:07:45.273
Very good jacket. A bargain.
Just the pocket's torn.

01:07:45.482 --> 01:07:47.192
She gave it to me.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:52.739
Pebbles on the roof. Why?
So it doesn't fly away? Nonsense.

01:07:53.365 --> 01:07:55.283
Once I'd like to fly.

01:07:55.492 --> 01:08:00.163
The plane circles over Berlin,
one day it'll crash.

01:08:00.372 --> 01:08:04.709
It's cold. My hands were
always warm. A good sign.

01:08:04.918 --> 01:08:07.671
It crackles underfoot.
What time is it?

01:08:07.879 --> 01:08:13.426
The sun's setting. Logical, the west.
Now I know where the west is.

01:08:13.635 --> 01:08:16.888
I always took the U-Bahn to the east
to go home...

01:08:17.096 --> 01:08:19.557
bought 10 tickets, saved a Mark.

01:08:19.765 --> 01:08:22.894
The sun in my back,
on the left the star.

01:08:23.103 --> 01:08:26.814
Sun and a star.
Her little feet.

01:08:27.023 --> 01:08:30.652
Hopping from one foot to the other.
She danced so sweetly.

01:08:30.859 --> 01:08:32.237
We were all alone.

01:08:32.444 --> 01:08:36.157
Has she got my letter?
I don't want her to read it.

01:08:36.366 --> 01:08:40.662
Berlin means nothing to me...
Havel? Is that a lake?

01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:45.834
Over there Wedding, or what?
The East is everywhere really.

01:08:46.042 --> 01:08:50.171
Strange people, they're shouting.
I don't care.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:56.051
All these thoughts.
I'd really rather not think any more.

01:08:56.261 --> 01:08:58.263
I'm going, why?

01:10:27.977 --> 01:10:34.776
Leave me alone, you swine.
- Mother. Mother.

01:11:08.018 --> 01:11:13.690
I'll never make it tonight.
No trapeze on full-moon nights.

01:11:13.898 --> 01:11:18.028
Not the last time, the very last time.

01:11:18.236 --> 01:11:20.905
I should wake up from this dream.

01:11:21.114 --> 01:11:25.827
The end of the circus. Fini.

01:11:26.036 --> 01:11:31.374
And once again I feel
as if night were falling inside of me.

01:11:31.583 --> 01:11:35.837
Fear... Fear of death.

01:11:36.046 --> 01:11:39.632
Why not death?

01:11:39.841 --> 01:11:42.093
The essential at times...

01:11:42.302 --> 01:11:48.475
just being beautiful, and nothing more.

01:11:48.683 --> 01:11:54.230
To look at oneself in the mirror
is to see oneself think.

01:11:54.439 --> 01:11:57.484
So what do you think?

01:11:57.734 --> 01:12:03.281
I think I still have the right to be
afraid, but not to talk about it.

01:12:03.448 --> 01:12:08.411
You're not yet blind,
the heart is still beating.

01:12:08.661 --> 01:12:11.748
And now you're crying after all.

01:12:11.956 --> 01:12:16.503
You'd like to cry
like a very sad little girl.

01:12:16.711 --> 01:12:20.090
Do you know why you're crying?
For whom?

01:12:20.298 --> 01:12:24.552
Not for me.
I don't know for whom.

01:12:24.761 --> 01:12:29.724
I'd like to know. I know nothing.

01:12:29.933 --> 01:12:36.815
I'm a little bit afraid.
It's gone, gone away. It'll come back.

01:12:37.065 --> 01:12:38.900
It doesn't matter.

01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:21.553
Just to be able to say,
like right now, I'm happy.

01:19:21.761 --> 01:19:27.851
I have a story,
and I'll go on having one.

01:24:27.567 --> 01:24:31.363
There it is again,
this feeling of well-being...

01:24:31.613 --> 01:24:37.619
as if inside my body
a hand was softly tightening.

01:25:25.417 --> 01:25:33.049
When the child was a child,
it was the time of these questions:

01:25:33.258 --> 01:25:37.679
Why am I me, and why not you?

01:25:37.846 --> 01:25:42.559
Why am I here, and why not there?

01:25:42.767 --> 01:25:47.188
When did time begin,
and where does space end?

01:25:47.439 --> 01:25:53.486
Isn't life under the sun just a dream?

01:27:11.022 --> 01:27:13.983
Isn't that Columbo?
- Don't think so.

01:27:14.234 --> 01:27:19.197
Not with that moth-eaten coat.
- He wouldn't be out here.

01:30:01.568 --> 01:30:05.155
Well?
- I'm going to enter the river.

01:30:05.321 --> 01:30:09.451
An old human expression
that I only understand today.

01:30:09.659 --> 01:30:11.536
Now or never, moment of the ford.

01:30:11.745 --> 01:30:15.707
But there is no other bank,
there is only the river.

01:30:15.915 --> 01:30:19.044
Into the ford of time,
the ford of death.

01:30:19.252 --> 01:30:22.297
We're not yet born,
so let's descend.

01:30:22.464 --> 01:30:25.967
To look is not to look from on high,
but at eye-level.

01:30:26.134 --> 01:30:29.429
First, I'll take a bath.

01:30:29.637 --> 01:30:33.808
Then I'll be shaved
by a Turkish barber...

01:30:33.975 --> 01:30:37.645
who will also massage me
down to the fingertips.

01:30:37.854 --> 01:30:44.110
Then I'll buy a newspaper and read it
from the headlines to the horoscope.

01:30:44.361 --> 01:30:50.241
On the first day, I'll only be served.
For requests, ask the neighbour.

01:30:50.450 --> 01:30:54.329
If someone stumbles over my legs,
he'll apologise.

01:30:54.537 --> 01:30:56.748
If pushed, I'll push back.

01:30:56.915 --> 01:31:00.043
The bartender will find me
an empty table.

01:31:00.251 --> 01:31:04.339
A car will stop,
and the mayor will give me a lift.

01:31:04.547 --> 01:31:07.342
I'll be familiar to everyone,
suspect to no one.

01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:10.720
I won't say a word,
will understand every language.

01:31:10.970 --> 01:31:16.309
This will be my first day.
- But none of it will be true.

01:31:47.549 --> 01:31:53.471
I'll take her in my arms,
and she'll take me in her arms.

01:32:38.975 --> 01:32:41.686
I think he's drunk.
- Yes.

01:33:06.294 --> 01:33:07.671
Let's go.

01:33:38.576 --> 01:33:40.036
It's got a taste.

01:33:43.206 --> 01:33:46.042
Now I begin to understand.

01:33:53.091 --> 01:33:55.593
Is that red?
- Yes.

01:33:55.802 --> 01:33:57.929
Did you hurt yourself?

01:33:58.138 --> 01:34:00.598
Is today a good day?
- It's okay.

01:34:02.142 --> 01:34:05.145
And the pipes?
- They're yellow.

01:34:05.353 --> 01:34:08.398
Yellow. What about him?
- He's grey-blue.

01:34:08.606 --> 01:34:11.651
Grey-blue. This one?
- Purple.

01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:13.653
This one?
- Orange. Ochre.

01:34:13.862 --> 01:34:16.614
Ochre or orange?
- Ochre.

01:34:16.823 --> 01:34:20.118
Yellow, red... this one?
- It's green.

01:34:20.326 --> 01:34:24.622
And what's that over the eye?
- That's blue.

01:34:25.874 --> 01:34:27.250
Blue.

01:34:27.834 --> 01:34:30.962
Is it very cold?
- It'll soon be over.

01:34:31.171 --> 01:34:33.089
I'd love to have a coffee.

01:34:33.298 --> 01:34:37.135
Do you have money?
- Yes... no.

01:34:41.806 --> 01:34:44.642
I'm glad everything is fine today.

01:34:55.195 --> 01:34:56.571
Beautiful.

01:35:23.515 --> 01:35:26.393
Coffee.
- With milk and sugar?

01:35:26.601 --> 01:35:28.061
Black.

01:36:10.395 --> 01:36:18.395
When the child was a child, it lived
on apples and bread, that was enough.

01:36:18.862 --> 01:36:21.114
And it is still that way.

01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:31.450
When the child was a child, berries fell
only like berries into its hand.

01:36:31.624 --> 01:36:34.461
And they still do now.

01:36:36.504 --> 01:36:42.594
Fresh walnuts made its tongue raw,
and they still do now.

01:36:42.802 --> 01:36:49.559
Atop each mountain
it was longing for a higher mountain.

01:36:49.768 --> 01:36:55.982
And in each city
it was longing for a bigger city.

01:36:56.191 --> 01:36:59.694
And it still does.

01:37:03.114 --> 01:37:06.493
Reached in the treetop
for the cherries...

01:37:06.701 --> 01:37:11.081
as excitedly as it still does today.

01:37:13.625 --> 01:37:19.381
Was shy in front of strangers,
and it still is.

01:37:22.050 --> 01:37:28.890
Waited for the first snow,
and still waits that way.

01:37:35.772 --> 01:37:43.772
When the child was a child, it threw
a stick like a lance into a tree.

01:37:44.239 --> 01:37:48.243
And it's still quivering there today.

01:38:28.867 --> 01:38:33.830
How do I get to Akazienstrasse?
- Go up Potsdamer to Kleistpark.

01:38:34.039 --> 01:38:39.627
Right at Grunewald past Gleditsch,
no right turn at Goltzstrasse.

01:38:39.836 --> 01:38:42.213
Turn left, and there you are.

01:39:15.455 --> 01:39:20.460
This entrance is for the crew.
Extras, the other way, please.

01:39:29.469 --> 01:39:32.555
Extra.
- That's just what you look like.

01:39:32.764 --> 01:39:34.474
They all want autographs.

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:36.976
Lousy cop.

01:42:11.131 --> 01:42:15.051
Come on, Marion. Don't worry.
It'll be alright.

01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:18.888
I'll send you a postcard
of the Eiffel Tower.

01:42:19.097 --> 01:42:23.935
See you next season.
Don't forget the Alekan Circus.

01:42:24.144 --> 01:42:28.857
Bye Archie, see you next year.
- Au revoir.

01:42:29.065 --> 01:42:30.525
A thousand kisses.

01:42:30.734 --> 01:42:35.947
I'll send you a parcel.
With some Camembert cheese?

01:43:36.591 --> 01:43:42.013
I couldn't say who I am.
I don't have the slightest idea.

01:43:42.222 --> 01:43:48.103
I am someone
with no roots, no story, no country...

01:43:48.311 --> 01:43:50.897
and I like it that way.

01:43:51.106 --> 01:43:57.779
I am here, I am free. I can imagine
anything. It's all possible.

01:43:57.987 --> 01:44:03.868
I only have to raise my eyes,
and once again I become the world.

01:44:04.077 --> 01:44:07.956
Now, in this very place...

01:44:08.164 --> 01:44:14.379
a feeling of happiness
that I could always have.

01:46:14.624 --> 01:46:17.544
What are you doing?
- I'm sitting.

01:46:17.752 --> 01:46:20.213
Are you sad?
- No.

01:46:20.422 --> 01:46:24.092
Are you sick?
- Yes.

01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:26.886
What's the matter?
- A need.

01:46:27.095 --> 01:46:29.681
Oh, that's it.

01:46:29.889 --> 01:46:33.685
A double knot is the only way
to make it hold.

01:46:38.106 --> 01:46:42.527
A need. A need of food perhaps.
- Or a need of drink.

01:46:45.405 --> 01:46:49.367
She isn't gone, Cassiel. I know it.

01:46:49.576 --> 01:46:51.911
I'll find her.

01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:56.666
Something will happen,
something important, tonight.

01:46:59.544 --> 01:47:02.505
She'll teach me everything.

01:47:03.631 --> 01:47:08.345
There are other suns then the one
up in the sky, Cassiel.

01:47:08.553 --> 01:47:13.183
In the deep of the night,
spring will begin today.

01:47:13.391 --> 01:47:16.728
Other wings will grow
in place of the old ones.

01:47:16.936 --> 01:47:20.815
Wings that will at last astound me.

01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:33.910
It must finally become serious.

01:56:37.706 --> 01:56:42.794
I've often been alone,
but I've never lived alone.

01:56:46.881 --> 01:56:50.635
When I was with someone
I was often happy...

01:56:50.844 --> 01:56:54.222
but at the same time
it all seemed a coincidence.

01:56:54.431 --> 01:57:00.311
These people were my parents,
but it could have been others.

01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:03.898
Why was the brown-eyed one
my brother...

01:57:04.107 --> 01:57:08.945
and not the green-eyed boy
on the opposite platform?

01:57:10.488 --> 01:57:13.992
The taxi driver's daughter
was my friend...

01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:21.416
but I might as well have put
my arm around a horse's neck.

01:57:21.624 --> 01:57:26.504
I was with a man, I was in love...

01:57:26.713 --> 01:57:29.799
and I might as well
have left him there...

01:57:30.008 --> 01:57:36.181
and gone off with the stranger
we met in the street.

01:57:39.684 --> 01:57:42.729
Look at me, or don't.

01:57:42.937 --> 01:57:46.024
Give me your hand, or don't.

01:57:47.525 --> 01:57:52.906
No, don't give me your hand,
and look away.

01:57:58.745 --> 01:58:01.706
I think tonight is the new moon.

01:58:03.249 --> 01:58:05.543
No night more peaceful.

01:58:08.963 --> 01:58:12.550
No bloodshed in all the city.

01:58:12.759 --> 01:58:15.470
I've never played with anyone
and yet...

01:58:15.679 --> 01:58:21.017
Now it's serious.

01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:27.440
At last it's becoming serious.

01:58:30.652 --> 01:58:33.363
So I've grown older.

01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:39.369
Was I the only one
who wasn't serious?

01:58:40.787 --> 01:58:44.040
Is it our times that are not serious?

01:58:45.417 --> 01:58:51.047
I've never been lonely,
neither alone, nor with someone else.

01:58:51.256 --> 01:58:54.342
But I would have liked to be lonely.

01:58:54.551 --> 01:58:59.556
I am whole at last.

01:58:59.764 --> 01:59:05.770
Now I can say it,
as tonight I'm lonely at last.

01:59:05.979 --> 01:59:10.025
I must put an end to coincidence.

01:59:14.029 --> 01:59:17.365
The new moon of decision.

01:59:17.574 --> 01:59:22.537
I don't know if there is a destiny,
but there is a decision.

01:59:22.746 --> 01:59:25.331
Decide.

01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:29.502
Now we are the times.

01:59:29.711 --> 01:59:36.009
Not only the whole town, the whole
world is taking part in our decision.

01:59:36.217 --> 01:59:42.140
Now we are more than the two of us.
We incarnate something.

01:59:42.349 --> 01:59:45.560
We are sitting
on the People's Square...

01:59:45.769 --> 01:59:51.649
and the whole place is full of people
whose dream is the same as ours.

01:59:51.858 --> 01:59:56.071
We are deciding everybody's game.

01:59:56.279 --> 02:00:03.745
I am ready.
Now it's your turn.

02:00:03.953 --> 02:00:07.123
You hold the game in your hand.

02:00:07.332 --> 02:00:10.794
Now or never.

02:00:15.590 --> 02:00:22.514
You need me.
You will need me.

02:00:22.722 --> 02:00:30.063
There is no greater story than ours,
that of man and woman.

02:00:30.271 --> 02:00:34.359
It will be a story of giants.

02:00:34.567 --> 02:00:39.614
Invisible, transposable.

02:00:39.823 --> 02:00:43.743
A story of new ancestors.

02:00:45.870 --> 02:00:48.998
Look, my eyes.

02:00:51.042 --> 02:00:55.505
They are the image of necessity...

02:00:55.714 --> 02:00:59.884
of the future of everyone in the place.

02:01:03.096 --> 02:01:08.101
Last night I dreamt of a stranger.

02:01:11.813 --> 02:01:14.107
Of my man.

02:01:14.315 --> 02:01:17.569
Only with him could I be lonely...

02:01:17.777 --> 02:01:19.904
open up to him...

02:01:20.113 --> 02:01:24.701
wholly open, wholly for him...

02:01:24.909 --> 02:01:28.663
welcome him wholly into me...

02:01:28.872 --> 02:01:36.872
surround him with the labyrinth
of shared happiness.

02:01:37.172 --> 02:01:40.383
I know...

02:01:40.592 --> 02:01:43.136
it's you.

02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:12.582
Something happened.

02:02:14.417 --> 02:02:21.132
It is still going on. It binds me.

02:02:21.341 --> 02:02:28.556
It was true at night, and it's true
in the day, even more so now.

02:02:28.765 --> 02:02:35.021
Who was who?
I was in her and she was around me.

02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:41.945
Who in the world can claim that he
was ever together with another being?

02:02:42.153 --> 02:02:45.281
I am together.

02:02:45.490 --> 02:02:52.664
No mortal child was begot,
only an immortal common image.

02:02:52.872 --> 02:02:56.918
I learned astonishment that night.

02:02:57.127 --> 02:03:02.382
She came to take me home,
and I found home.

02:03:06.052 --> 02:03:08.346
It happened once.

02:03:11.099 --> 02:03:15.353
Once, and therefore forever.

02:03:17.772 --> 02:03:22.736
The image that we created
will be with me when I die.

02:03:24.487 --> 02:03:27.699
I will have lived within it.

02:03:29.451 --> 02:03:36.499
The amazement about the two of us,
amazement about man and woman...

02:03:36.708 --> 02:03:39.544
has turned me into a human being.

02:03:44.215 --> 02:03:50.430
I know now...

02:03:50.638 --> 02:03:52.432
what...

02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:59.230
no angel knows.

02:04:05.070 --> 02:04:10.408
Name the men, women and children
who will look for me...

02:04:10.575 --> 02:04:15.497
me, their storyteller,
their cantor, their spokesman...

02:04:15.705 --> 02:04:23.705
because they need me
more than anything in the world.

02:04:25.048 --> 02:04:28.927
We have embarked.

02:04:30.595 --> 02:04:38.595
