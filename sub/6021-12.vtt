WEBVTT

00:05.372 --> 00:08.705
-Careful. This plate is extremely hot.
-Thank you.

00:10.877 --> 00:13.004
I just told you it was hot.
Why did you touch it?

00:13.179 --> 00:17.013
I just wanted to know
what your idea of hot is.

00:19.652 --> 00:21.381
Hey, babe,
you ready to hit the ice?

00:21.554 --> 00:25.354
Yep, I am ready to skate up a--

00:28.528 --> 00:30.428
Why are you wearing that?

00:31.765 --> 00:33.027
It's my winter coat.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.792
-A fur?
-Is there a problem?

00:37.637 --> 00:40.401
Seemingly infinite supply.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.672
Careful, it's hot.

00:50.283 --> 00:53.116
So Puddy wears a man fur?

00:53.720 --> 00:57.850
He was strutting around
the coffee shop like Stein Eriksen.

00:58.458 --> 01:01.393
And of course you find
fur morally reprehensible?

01:01.861 --> 01:05.422
Anti-fur. I mean, who has
the energy anymore?

01:05.932 --> 01:08.730
This is more about hanging off
the arm of an idiot.

01:10.537 --> 01:12.664
This is the first you're seeing
of the coat?

01:12.839 --> 01:14.807
We never dated in winter.

01:14.974 --> 01:18.171
You might wanna get a look
at that bathing suit drawer.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.545
We walked by Bloomingdales
and I saw that massage chair...

01:23.716 --> 01:26.116
...we wanna get Joe Mayo
as an apartment gift.

01:26.286 --> 01:27.844
An apartment-warming gift?

01:28.021 --> 01:30.751
We gotta give presents
to people for moving?

01:30.924 --> 01:33.256
Birthdays, Christmas,
it's enough gifts.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.792
I would like one month off.

01:35.962 --> 01:38.362
Kramer said it's perfect.
That's what we're getting.

01:38.531 --> 01:41.989
We're not buying it at Bloomingdales.
I will buy it. You pay me back later.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.102
I'll sniff out a deal.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.170
I have a sixth sense.

01:46.339 --> 01:49.308
Cheapness is not a sense.

01:49.476 --> 01:51.535
I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties.

01:51.711 --> 01:54.612
You know, the second you walk in,
he's got you working for him.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.476
"Hey, can you do me a favor?

01:56.649 --> 02:00.346
Can you keep an eye on the ice,
make sure we have enough?"

02:01.321 --> 02:04.290
I had a great time at the last one.
I was in charge of the music.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.118
I turned that mother out.

02:07.494 --> 02:09.485
Hey, you got any pliers?

02:09.662 --> 02:12.893
What? Has Newman got
another Army man stuck in his ear?

02:14.033 --> 02:16.058
Hilarious.

02:16.402 --> 02:18.836
Newman and I are reversing
the peepholes on our door...

02:19.005 --> 02:20.768
...so you can see in.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.874
-Why?
-To prevent an ambush.

02:27.046 --> 02:29.810
Yeah. Now, I can peek in
and see if anyone is waiting...

02:29.983 --> 02:33.043
...to jack me with a sock full
of pennies.

02:33.219 --> 02:35.414
But then anyone can just look in
and see you.

02:35.588 --> 02:38.182
Our policy is we're comfortable
with our bodies.

02:38.358 --> 02:41.122
You know, if somebody wants
to help themselves to an eyeful...

02:41.294 --> 02:43.319
...well, we say enjoy the show.

02:46.099 --> 02:49.660
I'm sorry. I can't stay
for the second act.

02:49.836 --> 02:53.101
Hey, George, here's the model number
on that chair, by the way.

02:53.673 --> 02:57.370
-Nice wallet.
-Wallet.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.972
-What?
-Nobody carries wallets anymore.

03:01.147 --> 03:03.342
I mean they went out
with powdered wigs.

03:04.751 --> 03:07.811
Here's what you need. Just a couple
of cards and your bank roll, see?

03:07.987 --> 03:11.684
-Keep the big bills on the outside.
-That's a five.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:21.534 --> 03:23.126
-What are you doing?
-Hey, Silvio.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.032
Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.400
Hey, you know, you gotta get
permission from me.

03:27.574 --> 03:30.042
I'm the super.
Who said you could do that?

03:30.210 --> 03:33.543
Well, who says I can do any
of the things I do in my place?

03:33.713 --> 03:36.204
-Like what?
-Well, like--

03:36.649 --> 03:39.209
Nothing. Well, I'll switch it back.

03:40.286 --> 03:42.413
No, no, no. That's all right.

03:42.589 --> 03:45.217
Yeah, well, that's good.
Because Newman and l, we think--

03:45.391 --> 03:48.087
-Newman? He did this too?
-Well, yeah.

03:48.962 --> 03:51.453
I deal with him.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.498
Look at this.
The same massage chair...

03:57.670 --> 03:59.831
...we're getting for Joe Mayo,
$60 cheaper.

04:00.006 --> 04:01.564
Except the store's in Delaware.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.231
I'll have them overnight it.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.603
Maybe cheapness is a sense.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.346
You know, it is better
without this big wallet.

04:08.514 --> 04:09.538
It's more comfortable.

04:09.716 --> 04:12.446
It doesn't matter
if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.

04:12.619 --> 04:16.055
-Why?
-Important things go in a case.

04:16.221 --> 04:17.951
You got a skull for your brain...

04:18.124 --> 04:23.619
...a plastic sleeve for your comb
and a wallet for your money.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.432
Look at this thing.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.293
It's huge.

04:30.703 --> 04:33.831
You got more cow here than here.

04:35.341 --> 04:38.242
I need everything in there.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.177
Irish money?

04:42.582 --> 04:44.277
I might go there.

04:45.151 --> 04:50.282
"Show this card at any participating
Orlando area Exxon station...

04:51.024 --> 04:54.551
...to get your free
Save the Tiger poster."

04:55.261 --> 04:59.254
Just give me that. Give me some
of those Sweet'N Lows.

05:16.182 --> 05:17.649
-Who is it?
-It's Newman.

05:22.388 --> 05:25.482
-I'm in the middle of something.
-I can't believe I'm being evicted.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.956
-What are you talking about?
-The reverse peepholes.

05:28.127 --> 05:30.595
Silvio says I'm an agitator
and I'm out of the building.

05:30.763 --> 05:31.889
No, he can't do that.

05:32.065 --> 05:35.262
I'm homeless. I'm gonna be out
on the street, dancing for nickels.

05:35.435 --> 05:37.767
I'll be with the hobos
eating out of a bucket.

05:37.937 --> 05:41.566
Come on, we'll go and talk to him
and we'll straighten this thing out.

05:42.909 --> 05:46.003
You better put something on.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.682
George, I am loving
this no-wallet thing.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.417
A man carries a wallet.

06:00.593 --> 06:03.926
The very fact that you oppose this
makes me think I'm onto something.

06:05.598 --> 06:07.623
-Hey, Jerry.
-Hey, Joe Mayo.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.267
-Nice place.
-Thanks.

06:09.435 --> 06:11.426
Can you do me a favor
and stay by the phone...

06:11.604 --> 06:13.697
...in case anybody calls
and needs directions?

06:13.873 --> 06:15.204
-Love to.
-Thanks.

06:15.808 --> 06:17.036
-Jerry.
-Music?

06:17.210 --> 06:19.110
Can you keep an eye
on the aquarium...

06:19.278 --> 06:21.712
...and make sure nobody
taps on the glass?

06:22.949 --> 06:24.541
Well, I could do that and the music.

06:24.717 --> 06:28.050
Oh, no, don't worry about the music.
Just have fun.

06:29.622 --> 06:32.284
I was ready to get jiggy with it.

06:33.192 --> 06:34.386
-Hey.
-Hey, Elaine.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.959
Hey.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.961
I think you know Dr. Zaius.

06:41.134 --> 06:44.160
So, Elaine, notice anything different
about my pants?

06:45.938 --> 06:47.667
So, George...

06:49.175 --> 06:51.575
-...did you get the chair?
-No, I don't have it yet.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.405
So we're giving him nothing?

06:53.579 --> 06:55.911
No, I brought a picture of the chair.

06:56.616 --> 06:58.277
Did you at least get him a card?

06:58.651 --> 07:00.642
I thought we'd all sign the picture.

07:01.287 --> 07:03.187
-Elaine.
-Hey, Joe Mayo.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.916
-I need you to be in charge of coats.
-Oh, fantastic.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.354
All right.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.555
There you go.

07:12.198 --> 07:15.690
Puddy, can you make sure nobody
puts a drink on my sound system?

07:15.868 --> 07:17.768
Sure thing, Joe Mayo.

07:18.137 --> 07:21.004
Hi, I'm Jerry.
How do you like my pants?

07:21.174 --> 07:22.266
Nice.

07:22.742 --> 07:24.175
It's working.

07:24.343 --> 07:26.311
Don't tap on the glass.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.281
Joe Mayo's apartment.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.641
Hey.

07:32.819 --> 07:34.810
Cocktail off the speaker.

07:51.370 --> 07:53.235
Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.172
Why are we in Jerry's apartment?

07:58.344 --> 08:02.178
Well, I like to think of this
as my conference room.

08:02.348 --> 08:04.316
Yeah, it has
a more formal atmosphere...

08:04.484 --> 08:08.045
...you know, with the shelves
and the furniture.

08:08.688 --> 08:11.384
Make it quick, Kramer.
My wife and I are about to go bowling.

08:14.393 --> 08:17.328
Newman thinks
that you evicted him.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.987
I did.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.725
I don't like Mr. Newman.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.003
-He is an agitator.
-Look.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.298
I've known Newman all my life
in the building...

08:27.473 --> 08:30.033
...and you're all wrong about him.
He's a model tenant.

08:30.209 --> 08:33.667
Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.

08:35.081 --> 08:38.414
-Okay. On your word, he can stay.
-All right.

08:38.583 --> 08:42.577
But I'm gonna keep my eye on him.

08:43.655 --> 08:46.386
Well, you won't regret it.

08:51.464 --> 08:52.453
What's wrong?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.028
Elaine, thanks for coming.

09:00.406 --> 09:02.397
Good working with you.

09:02.575 --> 09:05.169
All right, let's hit the bricks.

09:06.646 --> 09:10.275
-What?
-Hey, I got a coat just like this.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.487
So Joe Mayo had the same coat.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.648
And you threw it out the window?

09:19.825 --> 09:21.622
God, you're like a rock star.

09:22.161 --> 09:24.356
So now, Joe Mayo wants me
to buy him a new coat.

09:24.530 --> 09:25.724
Because you threw it out.

09:25.898 --> 09:29.561
No. Because I was in charge
of the coats.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.566
It's insane.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.932
But you did throw his coat
out the window.

09:34.106 --> 09:35.835
But he doesn't know that.

09:36.008 --> 09:37.771
As far as he knows,
someone stole it...

09:37.944 --> 09:40.412
...and that's the person
who should be held responsible.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.944
But that's you.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.448
So I'll have to buy him
a new coat...

09:49.622 --> 09:54.150
...even though I don't think I should be
held responsible, which I am anyway.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.756
Well, I'm satisfied.

10:04.637 --> 10:07.504
My back is killing me.

10:10.009 --> 10:13.103
Of course. Because of that wallet.

10:13.279 --> 10:16.771
You got a filing cabinet
under half of your ass.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.350
This is an organizer...

10:20.519 --> 10:24.455
...a secretary and a friend.

10:25.491 --> 10:28.324
Look at you, you're on a slant.

10:28.494 --> 10:31.327
Here, just give me a couple
of napkins....

10:36.502 --> 10:39.300
Here. Yeah, I'm fine.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.605
What was that?

10:43.776 --> 10:46.210
I think I had some hard candy
in there.

10:48.848 --> 10:51.408
Oh, no, this is supposed to go
to Joe Mayo's apartment.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.483
How does this thing work?

10:59.792 --> 11:03.159
Sir, do you want me to deliver
this chair to your friend's place or not?

11:09.068 --> 11:10.194
-Ready to go?
-All set.

11:10.369 --> 11:12.837
-Can't believe we're going dancing.
-You don't go often?

11:13.005 --> 11:15.735
No, because it's so stupid.
Shall we?

11:16.142 --> 11:17.871
Do me a favor.
Can you hold this for me?

11:18.044 --> 11:20.103
Compact, lipstick, all this?

11:20.279 --> 11:22.372
And can you also carry my keys?

11:22.548 --> 11:24.846
What are you,
a medieval dungeon master?

11:25.017 --> 11:26.678
And a tin of Altoids.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.290
Sharp key.

11:33.459 --> 11:35.359
So you're sleeping
with Silvio's wife?

11:35.528 --> 11:38.520
Well, there's very little sleeping
going on.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.666
Well, why didn't you tell me
about this?

11:40.833 --> 11:42.767
I don't see how
it's any of your business.

11:42.935 --> 11:44.562
Well, it's my business now.

11:44.737 --> 11:46.602
Look, I stuck up for you.

11:46.772 --> 11:49.570
Man, if he catches you,
we're both out.

11:50.776 --> 11:53.040
Hey, what is that up that tree?

11:54.547 --> 11:56.674
Man, that looks like a dead bear.

11:56.849 --> 12:00.250
No. That's a fur coat.
Hey, give me a boost.

12:04.623 --> 12:07.091
Where did you learn
to climb trees like that?

12:07.259 --> 12:09.557
The Pacific Northwest.

12:15.034 --> 12:18.401
So you had to carry
some of Keri's stuff, big deal.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.540
You don't understand.
I went on a successful pocket diet...

12:21.707 --> 12:23.732
...and I wanna keep that weight off.

12:23.909 --> 12:27.845
You know what? We sell this thing
at Peterman that'd be perfect for you.

12:28.013 --> 12:30.311
Not more of that crap
from the <i>Titanic?</i>

12:30.483 --> 12:34.249
No, no. It's a small men's carryall.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.354
I'm not carrying a purse.

12:36.522 --> 12:38.854
It's not a purse. It's European.

12:41.026 --> 12:44.325
Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo
that chair yet?

12:44.497 --> 12:45.486
I don't know.

12:45.664 --> 12:49.031
If I'm getting him a new fur,
I'm not chipping in on a gift too.

12:49.635 --> 12:50.624
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:50.803 --> 12:52.794
George, did you get Joe Mayo
that chair yet?

12:52.972 --> 12:57.568
Not yet. Oh, God.

12:58.811 --> 13:03.544
-What?
-It's in transit.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.111
-Did he get it?
-No.

13:05.684 --> 13:07.208
Good. Tell him I'm out.

13:07.386 --> 13:08.717
What? She's out?

13:08.888 --> 13:11.652
So? You're getting a deal, right?
We'll split it three ways.

13:11.824 --> 13:15.555
All right.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.891
What is that noise?

13:18.264 --> 13:20.858
That's my toaster. I gotta go.

13:23.569 --> 13:25.002
Sometimes I get the feeling...

13:25.171 --> 13:27.867
...George isn't being completely
honest with me.

13:29.575 --> 13:31.008
Hey.

13:31.177 --> 13:33.168
Oh, here--

13:34.046 --> 13:36.844
-Here are your pliers back.
-Oh, thanks.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.086
Weak hinge.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.090
Well, I guess I better go
and price fur coats.

13:46.258 --> 13:49.125
Go down to 88th Street.
They're free.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.158
-What are you talking about?
-Well, they're hanging from the trees.

13:54.099 --> 13:56.090
You know, Newman found one
there yesterday.

13:56.268 --> 13:59.931
Man, that guy can climb
like a ring-tailed lemur.

14:00.773 --> 14:04.038
88th Street?
That's where Joe Mayo lives.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.837
That's the coat.

14:07.713 --> 14:09.112
What was that pop sound?

14:09.281 --> 14:12.273
Well, I had some hard candy
in there.

14:13.619 --> 14:16.554
So to what do I owe
this unusual invitation?

14:16.722 --> 14:18.917
Come in. Come in.

14:22.294 --> 14:25.889
This is very much
as I imagined it to be.

14:26.432 --> 14:30.266
Aside from this rattan piece,
which seems oddly out of place.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.097
Please, sit down.

14:32.638 --> 14:34.503
Newman...

14:34.673 --> 14:37.005
...I wanted to talk to you
about something.

14:37.176 --> 14:38.871
This isn't about my opening
your mail?

14:39.044 --> 14:40.306
-What?
-I don't. Never have.

14:40.479 --> 14:42.538
Anything I read was already open.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.715
Yeah. No. Newman...

14:44.884 --> 14:48.786
...I heard that you found
a fur coat in a tree...

14:48.954 --> 14:51.422
...and I believe that it belongs
to a friend of mine...

14:51.590 --> 14:53.649
...and I'd like to give it back to him.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.487
Sorry, climber's keepers.

15:04.303 --> 15:05.998
You know, Newmie...

15:07.006 --> 15:08.598
...I know how you feel about me...

15:08.774 --> 15:11.470
...and I have to tell you
I'm quite flattered.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.774
-You are?
-Oh, yeah.

15:13.946 --> 15:15.345
Of all the men that I know...

15:15.514 --> 15:19.348
...you're the only one who's held down
a steady job for several years.

15:19.518 --> 15:22.783
Well, it's interesting work.
I don't mind it.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.581
Don't you have a boyfriend?

15:26.759 --> 15:28.989
A burly, athletic type?

15:29.161 --> 15:31.493
Oh, him? Oh, don't worry. He's cool.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.222
-Cool?
-Very cool.

15:33.399 --> 15:34.491
So, what do you say?

15:34.667 --> 15:38.865
Can you do me
this one little favor, Newmie?

15:40.072 --> 15:42.802
How I've waited for this moment.

15:42.975 --> 15:45.773
But alas, my heart belongs
to another man's wife.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.846
-And I have given the coat to her.
-All right, we're done here.

15:49.014 --> 15:50.777
For I am in love with Svetlana.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.612
I don't care if the whole world knows
except for Silvio...

15:53.786 --> 15:56.482
...who'd throw me out of the apartment
where I'd be dancing--

15:56.655 --> 15:59.783
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

16:00.659 --> 16:04.390
-Nice carryall.
-It's European.

16:04.563 --> 16:08.329
-Do you still have my lipstick?
-Yeah, I think I do.

16:10.035 --> 16:11.900
I can never find anything in here.

16:13.339 --> 16:15.569
-Oh, here it is.
-Thanks.

16:15.741 --> 16:18.676
So that Joe Mayo throws
the worst parties, doesn't he?

16:18.844 --> 16:20.141
What was your job?

16:20.312 --> 16:22.678
My job was to keep you away
from the music.

16:23.215 --> 16:25.080
What? He doesn't like
my taste in music?

16:25.250 --> 16:26.239
Guess not.

16:27.052 --> 16:28.747
You should have been there
last year.

16:28.921 --> 16:31.412
I got jiggy with it.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.156
Kramer, it's Silvio.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.763
Open up, I need to talk to you.

16:40.399 --> 16:43.027
I can see you
through the reverse peephole.

16:49.308 --> 16:50.866
Hey, Silvio.

16:51.443 --> 16:53.035
Look at this.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.339
Svetlana says she find it
in the laundry room...

16:55.514 --> 16:58.745
...but I think it is a gift
from that postman agitator.

16:58.917 --> 17:00.441
-Where is he?
-Now, relax, Silvio.

17:00.619 --> 17:02.587
No, that's it. You're both out.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.019
Oh, come on. Newman
didn't even give her that.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.125
No, it's that's not even
a woman's coat. That's a man's.

17:08.627 --> 17:09.958
-A man's?
-Yeah.

17:10.128 --> 17:11.925
What kind of a man would wear fur?

17:12.097 --> 17:13.257
Oh, lots of them.

17:13.432 --> 17:15.559
-Would you?
-No.

17:16.135 --> 17:17.124
Then who?

17:18.737 --> 17:20.465
What about Jerry?

17:22.608 --> 17:24.541
-Jerry?
-Yeah, sure. He's a celebrity.

17:24.710 --> 17:28.271
Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs.
They're desperate, insecure people.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.271
-Yes, you are right.
-Yeah.

17:30.449 --> 17:32.849
"It's all about me, me, me.

17:33.018 --> 17:36.545
Please look at me. I am so pretty.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.156
Love me. Want me."

17:40.759 --> 17:42.659
Something like that.

17:44.096 --> 17:45.324
I have to do what?

17:45.497 --> 17:48.660
All you have to do is wear the fur,
so Silvio thinks it's yours.

17:49.334 --> 17:51.268
I'm not wearing the fur.

17:51.437 --> 17:53.928
Then Newman and l,
we get thrown out of the building.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.168
Is that right?

17:58.143 --> 18:00.771
All right. Why don't you just take
a good, hard look...

18:00.946 --> 18:03.414
...at what your life will be like
if I'm not around?

18:07.152 --> 18:09.916
-Newman too.
-Oh, come on, man.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.525
If you do it, I'll give you that Walkman
you're always asking about.

18:13.692 --> 18:16.661
-That's my Walkman.
-And you'll get it back.

18:17.296 --> 18:18.661
-All right.
-All right. Good.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.129
-Thanks. I owe you one.
-Hey.

18:21.300 --> 18:25.600
Hey, and by the way, that Walkman
was broke when you gave it to me.

18:26.572 --> 18:28.904
-You get that chair?
-It gets here when it gets here.

18:29.074 --> 18:30.166
Would you stop riding me?

18:30.342 --> 18:32.867
You know what,
just call up and cancel it. I'm out.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.307
Excuse me?

18:34.480 --> 18:37.643
Joe doesn't like my taste in music.
He's not getting a gift from me.

18:37.816 --> 18:39.681
I can't believe
you're dropping out too?

18:39.852 --> 18:42.377
So now, Kramer and I have to pay
for the entire gift.

18:42.988 --> 18:46.446
Now, who's this Joe Mayo
everyone's talking about?

18:47.459 --> 18:50.451
He's the guy we're buying
the chair for, remember?

18:50.629 --> 18:51.994
It was your suggestion.

18:52.164 --> 18:54.758
I think the chair is
a fantastic gift idea...

18:54.933 --> 18:57.367
...but I never heard
of this Joe Mayo.

18:57.536 --> 19:00.596
And frankly, it sounds made-up.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.836
Oh, so now I have to buy
the whole chair by myself?

19:04.009 --> 19:06.842
-No. You don't have to buy anything.
-I already bought it.

19:07.012 --> 19:10.971
I've been lying to you for three days
and now you're all screwing me.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.577
I don't understand.
Why didn't you tell us?

19:14.753 --> 19:18.052
I needed it.
My back is a little tweaked.

19:18.223 --> 19:20.817
Because of your giant wallet.
Just get rid of it.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.858
Never. It is a part of me.

19:23.028 --> 19:25.519
I will just return the chair
and it will be easy...

19:25.697 --> 19:28.530
...because the receipt
is in my good friend.

19:28.867 --> 19:32.064
Your good friend is morbidly obese.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.639
Well, at least
I'm not carrying a purse.

19:37.809 --> 19:41.939
It's not a purse. It's European.

19:42.814 --> 19:45.282
All right, Silvio's down there,
he's shoveling the walk.

19:45.450 --> 19:48.146
All you gotta do is put this on,
you go down to the corner...

19:48.320 --> 19:49.912
...you pick up a paper
and come back.

19:50.088 --> 19:51.715
-All right.
-There you go.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.323
How do I look?

19:56.695 --> 19:58.253
Odd.

20:02.568 --> 20:04.900
"Learn guitar. First lesson free."

20:23.422 --> 20:28.485
My receipts. The chair.
My tiger poster.

20:29.561 --> 20:33.292
Hey, Silvio. Just out for a little stroll
in my favorite fur coat.

20:33.699 --> 20:35.894
-That is your coat?
-It sure is.

20:36.368 --> 20:37.596
Kramer says you need it...

20:37.769 --> 20:40.795
...because you're an entertainer
and you're desperate for attention.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.440
That's true.

20:42.708 --> 20:45.836
-Jerry, you forgot your purse.
-Oh, thanks.

20:46.712 --> 20:48.236
Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here...

20:48.413 --> 20:51.746
...prancing around in his coat
with his purse.

20:53.252 --> 20:57.484
Yup, he's a dandy.
He's a real fancy boy.

20:58.523 --> 21:00.184
Maybe this isn't my coat.

21:00.359 --> 21:03.988
-Yeah, all right, you're not fancy.
-No. He's very fancy.

21:04.162 --> 21:07.859
"Want me. Love me.
Shower me with kisses."

21:11.703 --> 21:14.297
Jerry, where'd you get it?
That's his coat.

21:14.473 --> 21:18.671
No, it's not. It's mine.
I'm a fancy boy.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.370
That's not your coat.

21:20.545 --> 21:23.673
If that is not his coat,
who's coat is it?

21:23.849 --> 21:25.544
It's Joe Mayo's coat.

21:25.717 --> 21:27.810
Who's Joe Mayo?

21:27.986 --> 21:30.887
It must be the man
that's sleeping with your wife.

21:31.890 --> 21:34.188
-Hey.
-Hey. Hey. Hey.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.555
-Officer.
-There he goes.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.958
Somebody took
my European carryall.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.257
Your what?

21:40.432 --> 21:42.662
The black leather thing with a strap.

21:42.834 --> 21:43.823
You mean a purse?

21:44.970 --> 21:49.407
Yes, a purse. I carry a purse.

21:56.248 --> 21:58.375
So Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?

21:58.550 --> 22:00.745
Yeah, he's waiting inside
his apartment for him...

22:00.919 --> 22:03.149
...with a sock full of pennies.

22:03.655 --> 22:06.146
Should have had
a reverse peephole.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.691
Hey, babe.

22:09.695 --> 22:11.629
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

22:11.797 --> 22:13.389
What is that?

22:13.565 --> 22:14.998
It's my new coat.

22:16.435 --> 22:17.766
What? You ditched the fur?

22:17.936 --> 22:21.372
Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his.
He looked like a bit of a dandy.

22:21.573 --> 22:23.040
Check it out.

22:23.208 --> 22:24.732
Eight ball.

22:25.510 --> 22:29.173
"You got a question?
You ask the 8 Ball."

22:30.082 --> 22:32.915
You're gonna wear this all the time?

22:33.085 --> 22:36.077
All signs point to yes.

22:37.305 --> 22:43.222
