WEBVTT

05:16.792 --> 05:18.959
Gas!

09:32.626 --> 09:33.876
Let's go!

09:59.542 --> 10:01.417
This guy is so weird.

10:04.334 --> 10:06.834
It's like he is hibernating.
Is he in a coma?

10:06.959 --> 10:07.959
Stop it!

11:26.251 --> 11:28.667
What are you doing here?

11:42.209 --> 11:44.001
Eat your egg.

11:46.209 --> 11:47.709
Go ahead.

11:48.417 --> 11:49.792
Please.

11:54.501 --> 11:57.542
All of it.
Like that, yes.

11:57.667 --> 11:59.417
That's it.

12:00.751 --> 12:02.751
I'll be honest.

12:02.876 --> 12:05.417
I love honesty.

12:06.584 --> 12:09.792
We have been wandering
the city for days.

12:10.959 --> 12:12.667
We have nowhere to go.

12:14.417 --> 12:16.459
Maybe we could...

12:16.584 --> 12:19.209
work something out.

12:50.834 --> 12:54.251
Stop it, Lucio. When was the last time
you slept in a bed?

12:56.542 --> 12:59.042
Don't be a fool. Go to sleep.

13:03.042 --> 13:05.626
He locked us in here because
he is afraid of us.

13:08.126 --> 13:10.917
Good morning, Mr Sun.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.542
Take off your clothes
and put this on.

13:43.001 --> 13:44.292
Let's get to work, assholes.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.334
Skeletor...

15:20.459 --> 15:23.417
If I ever find you in here,

15:23.542 --> 15:25.626
I'll kill you.

15:25.751 --> 15:27.876
Is that clear?

16:04.792 --> 16:06.292
Aren't you going to eat?

16:08.834 --> 16:10.417
I don't like eggs.

16:11.417 --> 16:12.959
I just like the cartons they come in.

16:13.084 --> 16:15.001
Where do you get the eggs from?

16:17.667 --> 16:19.751
I trade them for things.

16:21.459 --> 16:22.834
What things?

16:25.959 --> 16:28.376
Finish your food, Skeletor.

16:29.417 --> 16:30.417
Go on.

16:33.376 --> 16:35.709
Eat your egg.

17:06.084 --> 17:08.959
Why are you with
that walking corpse?

17:10.334 --> 17:11.709
Who, Lucio?

17:12.166 --> 17:14.709
Just because.
Have you always been alone?

17:16.541 --> 17:18.001
My dear,

17:18.126 --> 17:20.501
I've never been alone.

17:21.959 --> 17:25.416
I hate all those cowards
who run away from her.

17:26.416 --> 17:31.417
They flee like helpless babies,
afraid of being in her presence.

17:33.209 --> 17:35.251
But me...

17:35.917 --> 17:38.209
I have an affair with her.

17:38.917 --> 17:40.626
With whom?

17:40.751 --> 17:43.917
When you embrace solitude

17:45.542 --> 17:48.209
your head spins around like crazy.

17:49.042 --> 17:51.626
And with every turn,

17:51.751 --> 17:54.501
you take more space in the void.

17:55.751 --> 17:57.501
Then...

17:57.626 --> 18:01.834
your skull unfolds and
blossoms like a flower.

18:06.209 --> 18:09.292
And in that thick darkness,

18:10.209 --> 18:12.001
where there is no light

18:12.584 --> 18:14.667
and your eyes can't see...

18:16.834 --> 18:20.292
your mind's eye can
see what lies beyond.

18:28.167 --> 18:31.459
People shy from certain thoughts.

18:31.584 --> 18:34.459
Their lives are a continuous
distraction from their own perversion.

18:34.584 --> 18:36.251
When you think about
fucking your mother,

18:36.376 --> 18:39.334
you quickly try to turn
away from that thought.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.709
Solitude, on the other hand,

18:47.626 --> 18:49.417
drags you,

18:49.542 --> 18:53.417
forces you to come face to face
with your darkest fantasies.

18:54.209 --> 18:55.876
And when nothing happen,

18:57.251 --> 19:01.126
you stop being afraid of your
most grotesque thoughts.

19:44.334 --> 19:45.709
You are a whore.

19:45.834 --> 19:48.209
- You are a turd.
- But you are still a whore.

19:48.334 --> 19:50.542
- What's your problem?
- That you are a whore.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.709
You are a piece of shit.

20:59.876 --> 21:01.667
What does this mean?

21:02.959 --> 21:05.042
You're losing your mind.

21:15.626 --> 21:18.042
- She just doesn't give in? Does she?
- What?

21:21.167 --> 21:23.667
Don't act like you don't know.

21:25.001 --> 21:27.501
She doesn't let you mount her.

21:27.626 --> 21:29.084
What are you talking about?

21:34.334 --> 21:37.126
Your balls will explode.

21:38.834 --> 21:41.459
You should at least jerk off.

21:46.459 --> 21:49.001
I could lend you some magazines.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.167
Just take the bull by the horns.

21:53.459 --> 21:55.667
But you are not strong enough
to ride it.

21:57.251 --> 21:58.792
You are so feeble.

21:59.584 --> 22:01.334
You need some blood.

22:02.834 --> 22:08.001
How come a nimrod like you ended up
with such a hot piece of ass?

22:10.126 --> 22:11.917
She is my sister.

22:19.126 --> 22:21.084
Fauna, we need to leave.

22:21.209 --> 22:22.501
Come here.

22:22.626 --> 22:24.001
No, let's go.

22:24.126 --> 22:25.792
Come here and we'll talk.

22:25.917 --> 22:28.209
We need to go now!

22:28.334 --> 22:29.959
We'll leave if you come here first.

22:37.667 --> 22:39.084
You have really pretty eyelashes.

22:39.209 --> 22:40.417
What?

22:40.542 --> 22:42.251
They're fake, right?

22:42.376 --> 22:43.667
How could they be fake?

22:43.792 --> 22:46.626
- They are fake.
- Of course not.

22:46.751 --> 22:48.709
Close your eyes.

22:50.334 --> 22:51.792
What's wrong with you?

22:52.376 --> 22:53.709
You're crazy.

23:52.209 --> 23:53.876
Sorry, I don't eat meat.

23:55.459 --> 23:56.979
He doesn't eat meat
since we were kids.

23:57.042 --> 23:58.584
Who brings you this food?

24:15.209 --> 24:17.626
Do you know how
the Nazis poisoned the Jews?

24:18.834 --> 24:21.667
With something they made
from almonds.

24:21.792 --> 24:23.834
They mixed it with gas,

24:24.292 --> 24:26.542
making for a slow,
excruciating death.

24:27.792 --> 24:30.459
But the most important thing is
that it was cheap.

24:33.417 --> 24:37.251
I fed you, I gave you shelter,

24:37.376 --> 24:39.876
and you dare to steal from me?

24:46.292 --> 24:48.459
Don't be crass.

24:48.584 --> 24:51.876
Finish your meal.

24:52.751 --> 24:56.542
It's rude to leave your food
untouched.

25:01.251 --> 25:02.751
And then...

25:03.417 --> 25:06.376
go fetch the dropper you stole

25:06.501 --> 25:08.459
and I'll save her life.

25:08.584 --> 25:09.959
Help her.

25:10.084 --> 25:11.751
Eat the steak.

26:54.917 --> 26:57.084
Insomnia.

26:57.917 --> 27:00.334
The black ghost.

27:00.459 --> 27:02.376
The pandrique.

27:02.501 --> 27:04.084
The blues.

27:04.209 --> 27:06.042
Gas.

27:06.167 --> 27:07.792
In all the cities.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.876
In all the cities.

27:10.001 --> 27:11.167
Now!

27:11.292 --> 27:12.584
Gas.

27:12.709 --> 27:14.001
The Cosmic.

27:14.126 --> 27:15.542
The crazed planet.

27:15.667 --> 27:16.917
The pyramids.

27:17.042 --> 27:18.667
The concept of zero.

27:18.792 --> 27:20.834
The blues, the gas.

27:20.959 --> 27:22.084
Gas!

27:22.209 --> 27:23.376
The homeless ape.

27:23.501 --> 27:24.792
The human servitude.

27:24.917 --> 27:26.126
The cursed world.

27:26.251 --> 27:27.501
Old age.

27:27.626 --> 27:29.126
The Cabin Blues.

27:30.417 --> 27:31.584
Gas!

27:31.709 --> 27:32.834
In all the cities.

27:32.959 --> 27:34.542
In all the cities.

27:34.667 --> 27:37.167
Take that.

27:37.292 --> 27:38.751
Gas.

28:29.501 --> 28:31.876
I left this place 47 years ago.

28:33.209 --> 28:37.876
With each breath you took,
we danced as one.

28:38.001 --> 28:41.376
Your heart went
boom, boom, boom...

28:42.626 --> 28:45.417
I was only a floating stain.

28:45.542 --> 28:48.251
I wasn't afraid of anything or anyone.

28:49.251 --> 28:50.959
The world...

28:51.084 --> 28:54.959
was a dense and warm substance
that embraced me.

29:07.167 --> 29:09.417
There was only you and me...

29:10.292 --> 29:13.167
But you spread your legs...

29:14.334 --> 29:16.709
and tossed me out into
this miserable world.

29:22.626 --> 29:25.334
You don't even know
why you did it.

29:41.417 --> 29:43.626
But now...

29:44.626 --> 29:48.126
we'll be foetuses again,
floating in a dense liquid.

29:49.001 --> 29:51.084
Happily for us,

29:51.209 --> 29:54.792
the agonizing moment of birth
will never come.

29:55.917 --> 29:58.292
We'll be reborn here
and we will die here.

29:59.001 --> 30:04.501
This place is the last monument
of a rotten society.

30:07.167 --> 30:09.501
Cheers, my love.

30:18.292 --> 30:21.167
You wallow in youth,

30:21.292 --> 30:24.542
but you are nothing
but rotting meat.

30:28.084 --> 30:30.584
And you want to protect her, right?

30:32.001 --> 30:34.292
That's what you are supposed to do.

30:35.292 --> 30:39.126
Protect her from this world
that lunges at her.

30:41.001 --> 30:44.292
Because that's what you
are supposed to do.

30:45.417 --> 30:48.001
But what do you want to do?

30:52.876 --> 30:55.876
Don't you want to throw yourself
at her?

30:56.876 --> 31:01.042
Enter every hole in her body.

31:01.167 --> 31:03.042
Defile her.

31:03.167 --> 31:05.626
- Penetrate her...
- She's my sister!

31:09.334 --> 31:12.292
Do you think that your cock,
that engorges like a snake

31:12.417 --> 31:14.459
gives a damn about her
being your sister?

31:16.792 --> 31:18.209
I pity you.

31:18.334 --> 31:22.917
You should be fucking like wild rabbits
instead of fooling around.

31:26.251 --> 31:28.501
"She's my sister."

31:31.667 --> 31:34.876
I'll show you.

31:36.584 --> 31:38.417
Take off your clothes.

32:04.042 --> 32:07.501
I'm not joking around, Skeletor.

32:26.834 --> 32:29.251
Your cock is so ugly!

32:33.042 --> 32:35.667
Now undress this beauty.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.542
Don't be a wuss,

32:42.667 --> 32:45.584
or else I'll do to her
everything you refuse to do.

32:46.334 --> 32:48.626
I know you want it.

33:12.584 --> 33:15.626
You are so shy.

33:15.751 --> 33:17.751
Look how gorgeous she is.

33:17.876 --> 33:20.417
And you can't even get it up.

33:29.042 --> 33:32.292
Suck him off until he gets hard.

33:41.959 --> 33:43.459
Like that.

33:43.584 --> 33:45.251
That's it.

33:45.959 --> 33:49.917
Relax, relax, relax...

33:52.209 --> 33:53.959
Relax.

33:54.584 --> 33:56.417
That's it, yes.

33:58.834 --> 34:00.542
Relax.

36:11.917 --> 36:14.292
<i>I close my eyes</i>

36:14.417 --> 36:18.292
<i>And I can see you shine</i>

36:19.667 --> 36:22.126
<i>My blood boils</i>

36:22.251 --> 36:26.042
<i>When I feel your warmth</i>

36:27.709 --> 36:30.042
<i>Nothing on earth</i>

36:30.167 --> 36:34.126
<i>Can tear us apart</i>

36:35.584 --> 36:38.209
<i>Since we come</i>

36:38.334 --> 36:43.417
<i>From the same heart</i>

36:43.542 --> 36:48.334
<i>Our love dawns</i>

36:51.251 --> 36:55.834
<i>Our love glows</i>

37:24.292 --> 37:29.251
<i>Halfway through a Rock & Roll tune...</i>

37:31.042 --> 37:33.334
<i>I remember the sun</i>

37:33.459 --> 37:36.501
<i>Shining its light upon you</i>

37:37.751 --> 37:42.209
<i>While I desperately danced</i>

37:44.209 --> 37:49.209
<i>I laid eyes upon you,
pure and out of reach</i>

37:51.626 --> 37:53.792
<i>When I felt in the sound</i>

37:54.667 --> 37:56.709
<i>That devours me</i>

37:57.417 --> 37:59.542
<i>Hour after hour</i>

37:59.667 --> 38:02.751
<i>Your presence beside me</i>

38:03.959 --> 38:08.542
<i>I want to be modern and cruel</i>

38:10.042 --> 38:11.917
<i>But it's my burden</i>

38:12.042 --> 38:15.292
<i>To be the last of the romantics</i>

38:45.459 --> 38:46.959
He is dead.

39:19.626 --> 39:21.251
Stop it!

39:46.584 --> 39:48.501
Leave me alone!

39:55.584 --> 39:58.751
Hey, we need food!

39:58.876 --> 40:00.417
Hey!

40:00.542 --> 40:03.417
We need food.

42:00.667 --> 42:03.167
Leave me alone. Get off me!

43:02.417 --> 43:04.542
Lucifer...

43:06.001 --> 43:07.501
Lucifer...

43:07.626 --> 43:09.209
Wake up.

43:10.417 --> 43:11.751
Wake up.

43:15.209 --> 43:17.292
- How much do you love me?
- I don't know.

43:17.417 --> 43:18.959
How much?

43:19.084 --> 43:21.376
- Leave me alone.
- How much?

43:21.501 --> 43:23.042
A lot.

43:29.459 --> 43:31.542
What are you doing?

43:35.751 --> 43:37.417
Close your eyes.

43:37.542 --> 43:39.417
- Why?
- Close them.

43:40.584 --> 43:42.084
Close your eyes!

43:46.209 --> 43:47.917
Open your mouth.

44:08.542 --> 44:10.251
There's no such thing as love.

44:10.376 --> 44:12.501
Only demonstrations of love.

50:53.876 --> 50:56.542
Neither the sun nor death
can be looked at steadily.

50:56.667 --> 50:58.834
Neither the sun nor death
can be looked at steadily.

50:58.959 --> 51:03.501
Neither the sun nor death
can be looked at steadily.

55:00.334 --> 55:01.709
Did you miss me?

55:05.167 --> 55:07.376
I was so scared when
your corpse vanished!

55:07.501 --> 55:10.334
Promise me you won't leave us again!

55:10.459 --> 55:12.126
- Promise me!
- OK, I promise.

55:12.251 --> 55:14.584
You have to mean it!

55:14.709 --> 55:16.417
I promise!

55:16.542 --> 55:19.751
We are a family, and families
stay together no matter what.

56:00.501 --> 56:03.001
Move it, asshole!

56:16.834 --> 56:18.626
You defended yourself like a dog.

56:53.501 --> 56:55.459
Calm down.

56:55.584 --> 56:57.542
He'll be fine.

56:58.167 --> 57:00.334
We have to leave him now.

57:00.834 --> 57:03.376
We have to take care of our friend.

57:04.459 --> 57:07.376
We don't want to be rude.

57:19.042 --> 57:21.417
Calm down or we'll kill you.

57:23.167 --> 57:24.834
You are a soldier.

57:24.959 --> 57:28.584
You knew that sooner or later
you had to die.

57:28.709 --> 57:31.042
Sooner rather than later.

57:39.042 --> 57:41.709
We won't kill you for money.

57:41.834 --> 57:44.792
We won't kill you for an ideology.

57:44.917 --> 57:47.417
Or for the pleasure of
watching you suffer.

57:48.501 --> 57:52.876
It's not revenge for what you have done.

57:53.751 --> 57:56.459
We are neither avengers
nor executioners.

57:57.584 --> 58:00.417
We will kill you for your blood...

58:00.542 --> 58:02.501
For your flesh...

58:02.626 --> 58:05.667
and the exquisite substances
inside your body.

58:08.376 --> 58:10.667
We chose you at random.

58:12.501 --> 58:15.001
Remember that chance

58:16.126 --> 58:20.751
is the greatest criminal
to ever roam the Earth.

58:32.417 --> 58:34.251
Scream.

58:34.917 --> 58:38.417
Let out all the shit
you have inside.

59:03.834 --> 59:09.501
<i>Mexicans, at the cry of war</i>

59:09.626 --> 59:15.126
<i>Prepare the steel
and the steed</i>

59:15.251 --> 59:19.959
<i>And may the earth
shake at its core</i>

59:20.792 --> 59:24.501
<i>To the resounding
roar of the cannon</i>

59:25.417 --> 59:30.334
<i>And may the earth
shake at its core</i>

59:30.459 --> 59:34.209
<i>To the resounding
roar of the cannon</i>

59:35.417 --> 59:40.417
<i>Gird, oh country,
your brow with olive</i>

59:40.542 --> 59:45.126
<i>The divine archangel of peace</i>

59:45.251 --> 59:49.751
<i>For your eternal
destiny was written</i>

59:49.876 --> 59:53.876
<i>In the heavens by
the hand of God</i>

59:54.001 --> 59:58.334
<i>But if a strange
enemy should dare</i>

59:58.459 --> 01:00:02.459
<i>To profane your
ground with his step</i>

01:00:02.584 --> 01:00:06.459
<i>Think oh beloved country,
that heaven</i>

01:00:06.584 --> 01:00:09.459
<i>Has given you a soldier in every son</i>

01:00:09.584 --> 01:00:13.834
<i>Has given you a soldier
in every son</i>

01:00:17.834 --> 01:00:19.834
Relax.

01:00:36.792 --> 01:00:38.417
I'm ready.

01:00:40.001 --> 01:00:42.709
It's better if you close your eyes.

01:05:19.251 --> 01:05:20.917
What's wrong with him?

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.584
He always does the same thing.

01:05:49.126 --> 01:05:51.042
You do have food, right?

01:06:00.751 --> 01:06:02.292
What's that?

01:06:02.876 --> 01:06:05.542
It stops you from feeling hungry.
Open up!

01:06:10.251 --> 01:06:12.209
Can I comb your hair?

01:06:23.042 --> 01:06:24.959
Have you lived here for long?

01:06:38.292 --> 01:06:41.209
Let me go, let me go.

01:06:42.459 --> 01:06:44.126
Please, let me go.

01:10:56.792 --> 01:11:00.417
This is not your average party.

01:11:02.084 --> 01:11:04.126
It's my name day.

01:11:04.251 --> 01:11:07.834
But it is also the day
I'll live inside your squalid bodies.

01:11:07.959 --> 01:11:10.292
Don't forget that the spirit
does not reside in our flesh.

01:11:10.417 --> 01:11:12.334
Flesh is the spirit itself.

01:11:13.792 --> 01:11:18.417
So I kindly ask that all you lowlifes,

01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:20.667
devour me until
there is nothing left.

01:11:20.792 --> 01:11:23.376
Eat every bit of my rotten flesh.

01:11:24.376 --> 01:11:26.376
Drink my blood.

01:11:26.501 --> 01:11:30.209
Warm as the Virgin's cunt.

01:14:12.917 --> 01:14:17.959
<i>Happy Birthday to you</i>

01:14:18.084 --> 01:14:23.334
<i>Happy Birthday to you</i>

01:14:24.459 --> 01:14:29.917
<i>Happy Birthday Dear Mariano</i>

01:14:30.042 --> 01:14:35.459
<i>Happy Birthday to you</i>

01:14:36.542 --> 01:14:42.167
<i>From good friends and true</i>

01:14:42.751 --> 01:14:48.126
<i>From old friends and new</i>

01:14:48.834 --> 01:14:54.542
<i>May good luck go with you</i>

01:14:54.667 --> 01:15:01.001
<i>And happiness too</i>
