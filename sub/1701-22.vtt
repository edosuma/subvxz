WEBVTT

00:07.966 --> 00:10.551
So I'll get candles
and my mom's lace tablecloth.

00:10.719 --> 00:13.220
Since it's Rachel's birthday
and we want it to be special...

00:13.388 --> 00:15.597
- ...I thought I'd poach a salmon.
- Oh.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.099
What?

00:17.267 --> 00:20.561
Question: Why do we always have to
have parties where you poach things?

00:21.396 --> 00:23.147
You wanna be in charge
of the food committee?

00:23.314 --> 00:26.400
Question two: Why do we always
have parties with committees?

00:26.568 --> 00:28.736
Yeah, yeah.
Why can't we just get some pizzas...

00:28.903 --> 00:30.946
...and gets some beers and have fun?
- Yeah.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.657
Yeah, I agree. You know,
I think fancy parties are only fun...

00:33.825 --> 00:36.869
...if you're fancy on the inside,
and I'm just not sure we are.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.664
All right.
You guys don't want it to be special?

00:40.832 --> 00:43.500
Fine. You can throw
any kind of party you want.

00:43.668 --> 00:46.462
- Joey, they're not real.
- Huh? Huh.

00:47.630 --> 00:50.883
I start miles beneath the surface
of these things, okay? They're fake.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.593
See? Honk, honk.

00:54.095 --> 00:57.347
Wow, it's like porno for clowns.

01:47.649 --> 01:50.484
I talked to Rachel's sisters.
Neither of them can come.

01:50.652 --> 01:54.154
Okay, so I still have to invite Dylan
and Emma and Shannon Cooper.

01:54.405 --> 01:56.532
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh, no Shannon Cooper.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.117
Why not her?

01:58.284 --> 02:01.203
Because she, uh... She steals stuff.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.290
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff...

02:05.458 --> 02:08.627
...and Joey slept with her
and never called her back.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.507
- Joey, that is horrible.
- Hey, I liked her.

02:13.675 --> 02:17.010
All right? Maybe too much. I don't know.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.471
I guess I just got scared.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.391
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

02:22.559 --> 02:26.145
Heh. I didn't think anyone
would buy that. Okay.

02:27.522 --> 02:31.233
- Hi, honey. How did it go?
- Ugh. It was the graduation from hell.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.570
You know, my cousin went to hell
on a football scholarship.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.948
You know, I mean, this is supposed to be
a joyous occasion.

02:38.116 --> 02:41.326
My sister's graduating from college.
Nobody thought she would.

02:41.744 --> 02:45.581
It's a true testament to what a girl
from Long Island would do for a Celica.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.001
- So, what happened?
- My parents happened.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.296
All they had to do was sit
in the same stadium, smile proudly...

02:52.463 --> 02:55.549
...and not talk about the divorce. But no.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.635
They got into a huge fight in the middle
of the commencement address.

02:58.803 --> 03:02.723
Bishop Tutu actually
had to stop and shush them.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.393
Ugh. But you know what?
You know what the good news is?

03:06.561 --> 03:08.437
I get to serve coffee
for the next eight hours.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.650
Okay, so I guess
we don't invite her parents.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.361
- Well, how about just her mom?
- Why her mom?

03:16.779 --> 03:18.697
Because I already invited her.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.283
Ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?

03:21.451 --> 03:22.743
Uh, can't invite her.

03:25.663 --> 03:26.955
She also steals.

03:33.046 --> 03:36.798
Okay, here are the candles.
Where's the birthday cake?

03:36.966 --> 03:40.844
Okay, we're not having birthday cake.
We're having birthday flan.

03:43.139 --> 03:44.139
Excuse me?

03:44.307 --> 03:46.308
It's a traditional
Mexican custard dessert.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.018
Whoa, that's nice.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.854
Happy birthday, Rachel.
Here's some goo.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.196
Dr. Green.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.323
Oh, my God. It's Rachel's dad.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.285
What are you doing here?

04:05.453 --> 04:08.205
What, the father can't drop by to see
the daughter on her birthday?

04:08.373 --> 04:10.290
No, no, the father can.

04:10.458 --> 04:14.211
But, um, since I am the roommate,
I can tell you that she's not here.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.338
And I'll pass along the message.
Okay? So bye-bye.

04:16.505 --> 04:20.341
Oh. You're having a party.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.177
No, no, not a party.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.764
Just a surprise gathering
of some people Rachel knows.

04:25.932 --> 04:29.810
- Uh, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
- I'll never remember all of that.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.479
So, uh, what's the deal?

04:32.647 --> 04:36.400
Rachel comes home, people pop out
and yell stuff? Is that it?

04:36.567 --> 04:38.860
This isn't your first
surprise party, is it, sir?

04:42.949 --> 04:44.574
Hi, Monica.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.372
The Chinese menu guy.
Forgot the menus.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.709
So basically, just a Chinese guy.

04:55.795 --> 04:59.798
Hey, Dr. Green, come with me.
We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.

05:01.926 --> 05:04.886
All right.
That sounds like a two-person job.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.434
Well, my goodness. What was that?

05:10.601 --> 05:12.894
Sandra, I am so sorry.
I thought you were Rachel.

05:13.062 --> 05:14.646
And we weren't ready for you yet.

05:14.814 --> 05:18.608
- You thought I was Rachel?
- Yes, because, uh, you look so young.

05:18.776 --> 05:21.403
And because you're both,
you know, white women.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.199
Oh, I missed you kids.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.368
Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?

05:28.536 --> 05:29.911
No.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.540
- No, I'll take that for you.
- Oh, well, thank you.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.376
- Okay.
- Such a gentleman. Thank you.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.879
Oh.

05:39.464 --> 05:43.633
Oh, it all looks so nice.
So festive. All the balloons.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.929
Oh, the funniest thing happened
to me on the way here.

05:48.097 --> 05:50.557
- I was driving...
- That's great. Ha-ha-ha.

05:53.811 --> 05:57.105
I can't wait to hear the rest,
but I have to go to the bathroom.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.107
So... Hey, come with me.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.902
- What?
- Yeah, yeah. It will be like we're gal pals.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.905
You know, like at a restaurant.
Oh, it'll be fun. Come on.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.281
Ha, ha. Come on.

06:10.828 --> 06:14.373
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Okay, think. Think.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.666
What would Jack and Chrissy do?

06:18.711 --> 06:22.214
Okay, now that your coat
is safely in the bed...

06:22.382 --> 06:24.674
Okay. We can come back out
in the living room. Ha, ha.

06:24.842 --> 06:29.304
So, Joey and Chandler, I think it's time
that you take Dr. Green over to your place.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.056
Uh, yes, absolutely.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.642
Um, why, again?

06:35.019 --> 06:37.521
Because that's where
the party is, you goon.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.774
See, this is just the staging area.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.276
- Right, it's the staging area.
- This is the staging area.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.321
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.

06:51.452 --> 06:55.539
All right, you guys are off
to party number one.

06:56.457 --> 07:00.710
And you...
You are off to party number two.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.548
All right, fellas, let's keep it moving,
let's keep it moving.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.302
Chandler, could you at least
send some women to my party.

07:11.722 --> 07:13.974
Okay, that's Ross. All right.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.143
Okay, they're coming. Shh!

07:23.276 --> 07:25.610
Thank you for such a wonderful dinner.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.654
Thanks for being born.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.615
Oh, thank you for my beautiful earrings.
They're perfect.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.451
- Aw.
- I love you.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.954
Oh. Now, you can exchange them
if you want, okay?

07:36.122 --> 07:39.416
Hmm. Now I love you even more.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.548
Surprise!

07:46.716 --> 07:49.009
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

07:49.177 --> 07:52.220
Oh, Monica. Oh, my God. Mom.

07:52.388 --> 07:53.722
This is so great.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.974
Happy birthday, sweetie.

07:56.142 --> 08:00.353
Wow. You. I had no idea.

08:00.521 --> 08:01.646
- Really?
- No, I knew.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.190
All right.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.610
Everybody, there's food and drinks
on the table.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.111
- Go across the hall.
- What?

08:08.279 --> 08:09.654
Right now, Joey and Chandler's. Go.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.531
- Why?
- Just go.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.827
- Weird.
- Surprise!

08:19.415 --> 08:21.583
Happy birthday, sweet pea.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.668
Daddy! Ha, ha.

08:28.299 --> 08:31.259
Both of them are here? Both of them?
Both of them are here?

08:31.427 --> 08:32.928
Well, we could count again?

08:34.514 --> 08:37.390
- I can't believe this is happening.
- You know what? This is ridiculous.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.101
Okay, this is your birthday,
this is your party.

08:40.269 --> 08:43.647
I say we just put them all together.
If they can't deal with it, who cares?

08:43.813 --> 08:46.233
- I do.
- That's who.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.152
Look, are you gonna be okay?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.363
Well, I have to be.
I don't really have a choice.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.323
I mean, I can look at the bright side.

08:53.491 --> 08:56.284
I get two birthday parties
and two birthday cakes.

08:56.452 --> 09:00.413
Well, actually just one birthday flan.

09:02.875 --> 09:06.253
- What?
- It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.

09:06.420 --> 09:09.130
Look, talk to Monica.
She's on the food committee.

09:15.930 --> 09:19.558
Joe, Joe, hey, some girl just walked up
to me and said, "I want you, Dennis"...

09:19.725 --> 09:22.352
...and stuck her tongue down my throat.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.354
I love this party.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.107
- Quick volleyball question.
- Volleyball.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.025
Yeah, we set up a court in your room.

09:29.193 --> 09:32.028
Uh, you didn't like that gray lamp,
did you?

09:33.114 --> 09:35.115
Joey, a woman just stuck her tongue
down my throat.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.325
I'm not even listening to you.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.954
- Dennis.
- Okay, that's me.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.915
Listen, ahem, honey,
can you keep Dad occupied?

09:44.083 --> 09:45.875
I'm gonna go talk to Mom for a while.

09:46.043 --> 09:48.628
Okay, do you have any ideas
for any openers?

09:48.796 --> 09:52.716
Uh, let's just stay clear of "I'm the guy
that's doing your daughter"...

09:52.883 --> 09:54.968
...and you should be okay.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.097
Okay, people, I want you
to take a piece of paper...

09:59.265 --> 10:03.143
Here you go. And write down
your most embarrassing memory.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.895
And I do ask that when
you're not using the markers...

10:06.063 --> 10:08.106
...you put the caps back on them...

10:08.274 --> 10:10.734
...because they will dry out.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.069
Hi, Dr. Green.

10:14.530 --> 10:17.324
So how's everything in the, uh...

10:17.491 --> 10:20.910
...vascular surgery game?

10:22.204 --> 10:25.665
It's not a game, Ross.
A woman died on my table today.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.834
I'm sorry.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.212
See, that's the good thing about my job.

10:31.380 --> 10:35.383
All the dinosaurs on my table
are already dead.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.472
Listen, you guys, um,
I don't mean to be a pain about this...

10:40.640 --> 10:43.850
...but, um, I've noticed that some of you
are just placing them on.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.977
You want to push the caps...

10:47.855 --> 10:49.981
...until you hear them click.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.693
Gunther. Where you going?

10:53.861 --> 10:56.571
I, uh, was sort of thinking
about maybe...

10:56.739 --> 10:59.866
No. No, you can't go. No, this is fun.

11:00.034 --> 11:03.495
Come on, come on, we're just
getting started. Here's your marker.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.832
Listen, if you want to go, just go.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.752
No. She'll yell at me again.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.840
All right, ahem, I can get you out.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.467
What?

11:17.635 --> 11:18.718
Shh.

11:18.886 --> 11:21.429
In a minute,
I'm gonna create a diversion.

11:21.597 --> 11:24.224
When I do, walk quickly to the door
and don't look back.

11:26.602 --> 11:29.354
- I think I need a drink.
- Oh, I'll get it for you.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.606
- What do you want?
- Scotch.

11:31.774 --> 11:36.194
All right, I'll be back in 10 seconds
with your Scotch on the rocks in a glass.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.737
Neat.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.698
- Cool.
- No, no, no.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.826
Neat, as in no rocks.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.370
Heh. I know.

11:48.666 --> 11:51.126
Oh, hello, Ross.
Now, where have you been?

11:51.293 --> 11:55.380
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom.

11:55.548 --> 11:59.217
Ahem. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.

12:02.596 --> 12:05.473
Oh. Scotch neat.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.851
You know, that's Rachel's father's drink.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.602
Oh. Huh.

12:09.770 --> 12:12.355
Mine too. Isn't that neat?

12:13.065 --> 12:14.315
Scotch neat.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.571
Would you excuse me?

12:24.034 --> 12:25.452
Hey. Hey.

12:25.619 --> 12:28.371
Where are you sneaking off to, mister?
Heh.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.957
I'm getting my cigarettes
out of my jacket.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.001
- No.
- No. What do you mean "no"?

12:33.169 --> 12:36.629
No, um, see,
because that's the staging area.

12:36.797 --> 12:40.383
You go in there, it'll ruin
the whole illusion of the party.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.553
Yeah, I think, you take your Scotch
back in there...

12:43.721 --> 12:47.140
...and I will get your cigarettes
for you, sir.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.602
- And get my glasses too.
- All righty-roo.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.317
What a great moment to say that
for the first time.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.991
Okay, the first person's
most embarrassing memory is:

13:05.159 --> 13:07.619
"Monica, your party sucks."

13:08.370 --> 13:10.121
All right. Very funny.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.541
Oh, no. Ooh.
Did someone forget to use a coaster?

13:13.709 --> 13:15.251
What?

13:22.218 --> 13:23.968
I don't see anything.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.347
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.602
Ross, whose glasses are those?

13:33.479 --> 13:34.771
Mine.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.857
You wear bifocals?

13:38.025 --> 13:39.359
Mm-hm.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.987
I have a condition apparently...

13:43.155 --> 13:45.240
...that I require...

13:46.534 --> 13:49.077
...two different sets of focals.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.872
Do you know my husband
has glasses just like that?

13:53.040 --> 13:56.209
- Oh.
- Well, those are very popular frames.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.753
Neil Sedaka wears them.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.384
I hear you can get people out of here.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.887
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

14:08.055 --> 14:11.140
You didn't tell me
your boyfriend smokes.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.643
Yeah, like a chimney.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.229
Big smoker.

14:17.481 --> 14:19.148
Big, big smoker.

14:19.316 --> 14:23.486
In fact, I'm gonna go out into the hallway
and fire up this bad boy.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.877
Are you wearing my glasses?

14:40.337 --> 14:41.796
Yes.

14:43.966 --> 14:47.886
I was just warming up
the earpieces for you.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.138
Thank you.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.641
Is that one of my cigarettes?

14:58.814 --> 15:00.273
Yeah.

15:00.858 --> 15:04.777
Yes, it is. I was just moistening the tip.

15:06.655 --> 15:10.033
Okay, okay. She's taking the trash out,
so I can get you out of here.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.577
But it has to be now.
She'll be back any minute.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.912
What about my friend Victor?

15:14.079 --> 15:17.624
No, only the three of you. Any more
than that and she'll get suspicious.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.460
- All right. Let me just get my coat.
- There isn't time.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.464
Just leave everything.

15:24.632 --> 15:27.091
They'll take care of you next door.

15:27.676 --> 15:29.677
Is it true they have beer?

15:30.763 --> 15:32.847
Everything you've heard is true.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.351
Could you guys please
try and keep it down?

15:36.518 --> 15:39.270
We're trying to start
a Boggle tournament.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.694
You. And you.

15:46.862 --> 15:50.990
You're supposed to be at my party.
And Gunther.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.080
What are you doing here?

15:57.456 --> 15:58.790
Um...

16:01.043 --> 16:02.877
Hey, welcome to the fo...

16:05.547 --> 16:06.673
Phoebe?

16:06.840 --> 16:09.759
All right, I'm sorry.
But these people needed me.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.261
You know, they work hard all week.
It's Saturday night.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.806
They deserve to have a little fun. Go.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.725
You know, my party is fun.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.645
I mean, maybe it's a little quieter,
less obvious sort of fun.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.023
But, you know, if people
would just give it a chance, it's...

16:28.237 --> 16:32.740
- You want me to see a therapist?
- Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem.

16:32.908 --> 16:36.703
You've chosen a boyfriend
exactly like your father.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.789
Okay, Mom, you know what? Fine.
I'll make an appointment.

16:39.957 --> 16:43.376
Okay? But you know what?
Right now, I gotta go. I gotta go do a thing.

16:43.544 --> 16:48.381
Did you know your mother
spent $1200 on bonsai trees?

16:48.841 --> 16:51.426
I felt like Gulliver around that place.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.761
Daddy, Daddy,
I really want to hear more about this...

16:53.929 --> 16:57.890
...I really do,
but I just have to do, uh, some stuff.

16:58.058 --> 17:01.144
You work and you work
and you work at a marriage...

17:01.311 --> 17:03.730
...but all he cares about
is his stupid boat.

17:03.897 --> 17:06.816
You work and you work
and you work on a boat.

17:06.983 --> 17:09.902
He always ridiculed my pottery classes.

17:10.069 --> 17:12.070
And you sand it and you varnish it.

17:12.239 --> 17:15.907
But when all is said and done,
he still drinks out of the mugs.

17:16.076 --> 17:19.203
One night of her yoga
and her Bridges of Madison County...

17:19.371 --> 17:22.290
- Scotch, cigarettes...
- Bonsais, the Chihuahua...

17:22.458 --> 17:24.666
I've only been
in therapy three weeks now but...

17:24.835 --> 17:27.336
What the hell
does she want with half a boat?

17:31.216 --> 17:34.886
Okay, okay, okay,
you can be shirts and I'll be skins.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.680
I'll be skins.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.561
Hey.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.730
How you holding up there, tiger?

17:47.608 --> 17:51.694
Oh. Sorry. When my parents were getting
divorced, I got a lot of "tigers."

17:51.862 --> 17:56.074
Ahem. I got a lot of "champs,"
"chiefs," "sports."

17:56.241 --> 17:58.034
Ahem. I even got a "governor."

18:00.621 --> 18:03.915
This is it, isn't it?
I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.501
My mom there, my dad there.

18:06.668 --> 18:09.128
Thanksgiving, Christmas.

18:09.296 --> 18:14.008
She gets the house, he's in some condo
my sister's gonna decorate with wicker.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.053
Chandler, how did you get through this?

18:17.429 --> 18:21.557
Well, I relied on a carefully
regimented program...

18:21.725 --> 18:23.935
...of denial...

18:24.812 --> 18:26.729
...and wetting the bed.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.859
You know, I just... It's so weird.

18:32.027 --> 18:36.697
I mean, I was in there just listening
to them bitch about each other.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.784
All I kept thinking about
was the Fourth of July.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.371
Because it reminded you of the way...

18:43.539 --> 18:45.873
...our forefathers used
to bitch at each other?

18:46.708 --> 18:47.917
It's just this thing.

18:48.085 --> 18:52.380
Every year we would go out
on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks.

18:52.881 --> 18:57.051
Mom always hated it because
the ocean air made her hair all big.

18:57.219 --> 19:00.513
My sister Jill would be
throwing up over the side...

19:00.681 --> 19:03.224
...and my dad would be upset
because nobody was helping.

19:03.392 --> 19:06.769
And then when we did help,
he would scream at us for doing it wrong.

19:09.940 --> 19:14.193
But then when the fireworks started,
everybody just shut up.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.946
You know, and it'd get really cold.

19:17.114 --> 19:20.908
And we'd all just sort of
smoosh under this one blanket.

19:21.076 --> 19:24.120
It never occurred to anybody
to bring another one.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.874
And now it's...

19:31.086 --> 19:32.587
Yeah, I know.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.862
Thanks for coming.
I hope you had fun.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.198
All right, Monica, dear,
I'm gonna hit the road.

20:00.365 --> 20:03.284
Now, I've left my 10 verbs on the table.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.786
Yes, and you be sure and send me
that finished poem.

20:05.954 --> 20:07.997
- Okay, will do. So glad you came.
- All right, dear.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.625
- I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
- Okay, let me go check.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.293
Oh, all right.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.963
- Your mom wants to say goodbye.
- Oh, okay.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.257
Happy birthday, sweetie.

20:18.425 --> 20:20.092
Okay.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.553
Uh, you drive safe.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.681
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

20:27.100 --> 20:30.478
I'm getting ready for the water skiing.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.939
Okay, big hug. One more. Come on.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.443
How are you?

20:39.571 --> 20:41.530
- Dr. Green. Where are you going?
- To get my coat.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.366
No, no, no.
We'll get that for you.

20:43.533 --> 20:46.369
All right, all right.
I can get my own coat.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.796
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.260
Oh, no. No, you're not
supposed to be here.

21:02.427 --> 21:05.846
This is the staging area.
It's all wrong. You should leave.

21:06.014 --> 21:09.225
Ha, ha. You know, just get out.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.069
Or perhaps you'd like a crème de menthe.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.739
I have to be heading toward my chateau.
Thank you.

21:23.907 --> 21:26.867
All right, well, then I guess
we're going back into the hallway again.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.995
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Green.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.506
Okay.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.426
You take care.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.723
Oh, you kids.

21:51.351 --> 21:52.727
Well.

21:53.937 --> 21:57.064
This is the best party
I've been to in years.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.567
Thank you.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.325
Okay, everybody, it's time for flan.

22:07.492 --> 22:11.078
Yep. Get ready for the gelatinous fun.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.790
Kind of looks like that stuff you get
when you get a bad infection.

22:14.958 --> 22:17.209
Okay, that's enough.

22:17.377 --> 22:20.463
Okay, Rachel,
make a special flan wish.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.424
Okay, I've got one.

22:27.387 --> 22:28.971
Heads up.

22:30.515 --> 22:34.060
Wow. Those things almost never come true.
