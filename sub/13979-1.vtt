03:02.803 --> 03:05.009
What do you see, David?

03:06.641 --> 03:09.428
Easy, you guys.
Nobody's going anywhere.

03:09.519 --> 03:11.393
What is it?

03:17.902 --> 03:20.191
Oh, my God!

03:27.888 --> 03:30.779
Death in heartland America.

03:30.874 --> 03:33.544
A tragedy of macabre proportions.

03:33.627 --> 03:36.045
I can honestly tell you
that I have never seen

03:36.130 --> 03:39.281
anything as shocking as
what was discovered earlier today

03:39.368 --> 03:42.918
in this sleepy little farming
community of Gatlin, Nebraska.

03:43.004 --> 03:47.154
Over 50 bodies in various stages of
decomposition have been discovered,

03:47.250 --> 03:50.080
setting up the scene as one of
the most gruesome mass murders

03:50.081 --> 03:52.189
in the history of the country.

03:52.447 --> 03:57.191
So far we've only accounted for...
about half the town.

03:58.946 --> 04:00.885
What those kids did...

04:00.973 --> 04:03.279
you should all pay for this.

04:04.868 --> 04:08.118
Can you tell us exactly what you saw?
What did it look like down there?

04:10.832 --> 04:12.791
Mr Simpson?

04:12.877 --> 04:16.459
Can you tell me what happened?
Did you see anything?

04:16.547 --> 04:18.873
I saw the corn.

04:20.468 --> 04:23.837
The children came under
the influence of several teenagers.

04:23.930 --> 04:27.299
The leader of this cult group
is Isaac Chroner.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.074
We're pretty clear
about that from a report

04:29.075 --> 04:31.487
by a young couple passing
through on vacation.

04:31.772 --> 04:35.220
Did you see what happened
to your mommy and your daddy?

04:35.309 --> 04:38.182
I... I saw the corn.

04:40.572 --> 04:44.672
OK, cut it.
What is all this shit about the corn?

04:45.587 --> 04:48.084
'We must rise up against our fears

04:48.415 --> 04:52.064
'and let the Lord's spirit
fill us with strength. '

04:53.669 --> 04:57.453
- Turn that down, please.
- '... may reach salvation. '

04:57.548 --> 04:59.755
'Let us pray.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.882
'O Lord, let the evil... '

05:01.969 --> 05:03.797
Turn it down!

05:05.891 --> 05:09.675
'The Lord cares not
if we have fallen... '

05:09.770 --> 05:12.771
I said turn it down!

05:12.856 --> 05:15.643
Nice fucking driving.

05:16.860 --> 05:19.067
Your mother teach you to talk like that?

05:19.155 --> 05:21.361
Only when your name came up.

05:21.449 --> 05:23.821
That's real funny now, isn't it?

05:23.910 --> 05:27.954
My ass is on the line.
Maybe you don't know that.

05:28.039 --> 05:32.499
If I mess up this job, I'm screwed.
You understand what I'm saying?

05:32.585 --> 05:36.002
Do you want me to apologise again?
Is that it?

05:36.089 --> 05:38.129
Sorry, John, I missed my flight.

05:38.216 --> 05:40.968
- Start by calling me Dad.
- Yeah, right.

05:41.053 --> 05:43.425
Why would I want to do that?

05:43.513 --> 05:45.885
Oh, you think I should feel grateful

05:45.974 --> 05:48.809
just because you usually
remember my birthday?

05:48.894 --> 05:50.803
It's not like you suddenly called up

05:50.896 --> 05:54.312
and said, "Hey, you know, Dan,
we should get together.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.318
"We should spend some time together."

05:59.947 --> 06:02.355
Open wide. Stick out your tongue.

06:02.450 --> 06:08.120
The surviving children are being
bussed to Hemingford, 19 miles away,

06:08.205 --> 06:11.955
where they'll be fostered
until permanent arrangements are made.

06:12.043 --> 06:13.953
This is Bob Collins reporting.

06:14.045 --> 06:16.252
All right, young man. Step up here.

06:16.339 --> 06:19.091
Come on, now.
Open up wide. Open wide.

06:19.176 --> 06:22.129
- Open. Ah.
- Aah.

06:22.220 --> 06:24.260
Very nice. Very nice.

06:24.347 --> 06:26.388
Now, don't forget your sucker.

06:26.475 --> 06:30.307
Hi. How are you, there? Open wide, now.

06:39.321 --> 06:44.447
No, the only reason I'm here is
Mom didn't want me at her wedding.

06:44.536 --> 06:45.947
Wrong.

06:46.037 --> 06:50.913
The way I heard it is you and
what's-his-name don't even talk anymore.

06:51.001 --> 06:52.080
Shithead.

06:52.168 --> 06:54.327
His name's Sherman.

06:54.421 --> 06:56.497
Right. Shithead Sherman.

06:57.882 --> 06:59.959
You got a real attitude problem.

07:02.471 --> 07:06.635
Yeah, well, I guess that's
genetic, huh... Dad.

07:11.772 --> 07:14.097
Where in the hell are we?

07:16.403 --> 07:19.154
Go on! Get out of my way!

07:20.573 --> 07:23.824
Don't you move that bus! Stop it!

07:25.036 --> 07:27.195
Stop right there! Don't you move one inch.

07:27.288 --> 07:29.495
Out of the way, folks.

07:30.792 --> 07:33.248
Come on, Mrs Burke.
Let's get this over with.

07:33.337 --> 07:35.377
Over my dead body!

07:35.464 --> 07:38.195
If we let those children
in our houses we'll

07:38.208 --> 07:40.707
end up dead, just like
those people did.

07:40.803 --> 07:42.842
Now, Mrs Burke... Oh!

07:42.930 --> 07:46.880
Mrs Burke, Mrs Burke! Haven't
these children been through enough?

07:46.976 --> 07:49.598
The children? What about their parents?

07:49.688 --> 07:51.764
They murdered their own parents!

07:51.856 --> 07:54.478
Those involved with the killings are dead.

07:54.567 --> 07:57.728
You have a big, empty house.
Why not volunteer it, like I have?

07:57.814 --> 08:01.949
I know all these children.
I know 'em everyone.

08:02.033 --> 08:05.160
I taught school in this town
all those years

08:05.161 --> 08:07.622
till I had the good sense
to get out of here.

08:07.715 --> 08:11.995
I know. What happened is over,
Mrs Burke. Now, come on.

08:12.086 --> 08:15.704
You got no need to die so young.

08:15.798 --> 08:20.460
I'm taking my house
and I'm getting out of here.

08:20.552 --> 08:23.638
- Don't you try to stop me!
- Come on.

08:30.688 --> 08:33.475
There's a stop sign. Stop sign, man!

08:37.570 --> 08:39.578
Hey! You crazy son of a bitch!

08:39.664 --> 08:41.205
It's Garrett! It's Garrett, man.

08:41.292 --> 08:45.424
Hey, ragman. How's it going?
How's the tabloid business, huh?

08:45.513 --> 08:48.913
I loved your piece on JFK and
his secret marriage to Rock Hudson.

08:48.914 --> 08:50.266
That was some journalism.

08:50.501 --> 08:53.770
All right.
What happened around here?

08:53.862 --> 08:56.575
Well a bunch of kids killed
all the adults in town.

08:56.588 --> 08:58.921
Just your basic Sunday
afternoon in the Bible Belt.

08:59.010 --> 09:00.786
Wait a minute.
Killed them all?

09:00.879 --> 09:03.085
Well, it's no worse than anything
you and I saw in Jonestown.

09:03.173 --> 09:06.889
- Where are they now... kids?
- Try 'Film at 11'.

09:06.976 --> 09:09.681
You'll love my wrap-up.
Come on, we're out of here.

09:09.771 --> 09:12.523
Hey, don't look so down.

09:12.608 --> 09:16.142
Just make something up.
That's your specialty, isn't it?

09:16.236 --> 09:18.276
You're an asshole.

09:18.363 --> 09:21.779
It's nice to see your friends
like and respect you.

09:38.176 --> 09:40.501
Yep. Nice short cut, Bobby.

09:40.595 --> 09:43.677
I'm telling you, the highway's
just over there. Relax, man.

09:43.765 --> 09:46.472
- Where?
- It's right over the hill.

09:47.769 --> 09:49.809
Turn left over here.

09:49.897 --> 09:52.352
- The highway's over...
- Turn left here!

09:54.026 --> 09:57.110
I want a shot of this corn, all right?

09:57.195 --> 10:00.611
This might be a short cut
to the highway anyway.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.760
Oh, man, we missed everything.

10:22.848 --> 10:24.887
Good. Let's get out of here.

10:24.975 --> 10:27.014
No. Not without the story.

10:27.102 --> 10:30.802
So make it up.
It's your specialty anyway, isn't it?

10:32.232 --> 10:34.640
Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm a reporter.

10:34.734 --> 10:37.820
Do you mind if I ask you some questions?

10:37.905 --> 10:40.990
Actually, I would.
Besides, I don't have any answers.

10:41.075 --> 10:43.827
- Just one question.
- OK, one.

10:49.375 --> 10:52.460
Do you know a place we can stay the night?

10:52.546 --> 10:56.378
It's just my son and me.
We want something real simple.

10:56.466 --> 10:59.218
You know, like, down-home,
cosy and comfortable.

10:59.302 --> 11:03.382
- Pays to advertise, huh?
- Do you have any vacancies?

11:03.473 --> 11:06.427
A room with twin beds for 30 bucks.

11:06.518 --> 11:10.102
- Great.
- Follow me.

11:20.408 --> 11:23.195
Well, excuse me.

11:49.146 --> 11:52.930
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this was a great idea.

11:56.070 --> 11:58.062
Stop the van.

12:03.245 --> 12:05.071
Pisses me off.

12:05.163 --> 12:08.746
- Well?
- Get out.

12:16.008 --> 12:18.048
How the hell did we get out here?

12:22.890 --> 12:27.267
I've got a bad feeling about this.
I don't like it.

12:32.233 --> 12:34.273
Let's get out of here.

12:41.576 --> 12:43.403
Come on!

12:50.169 --> 12:52.541
Come on, Bobby. Start the damn thing.

12:58.260 --> 13:01.047
Jesus Christ, man, it looks like a twister!

13:02.723 --> 13:04.929
- Get out of the van.
- Huh?

13:05.017 --> 13:06.845
Come on! Get out!

13:15.778 --> 13:17.605
Mac!

13:19.449 --> 13:21.276
Mac!

13:23.162 --> 13:25.035
Bobby!

13:26.957 --> 13:28.831
Mac!

13:32.504 --> 13:35.754
I can't see! Help!

13:38.887 --> 13:42.338
Bobby! Bobby!

13:48.021 --> 13:50.144
M- Mac!

13:50.231 --> 13:52.058
Mac!

13:54.986 --> 13:57.442
Bobby!

14:03.704 --> 14:06.111
Come on! Come on, window.

14:06.206 --> 14:08.246
Wind up. Come on!

14:08.333 --> 14:10.871
Come on, come on!

14:10.961 --> 14:14.165
Come on! Start, you piece of junk!

14:19.304 --> 14:21.841
No!

14:41.118 --> 14:43.324
Ah, that was really good.

14:43.412 --> 14:45.986
Good. Can I take your plate?

14:46.082 --> 14:48.121
Why don't you help?

14:48.209 --> 14:50.118
Help the lady.

14:50.211 --> 14:52.251
- Thank you, Danny.
- Sure.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.262
Micah.

15:03.850 --> 15:06.223
Did you see what happened?

15:09.773 --> 15:12.015
Some of it.

15:13.652 --> 15:15.479
Like what?

15:18.073 --> 15:20.113
My parents.

15:20.201 --> 15:22.739
You saw what happened to them?

15:25.623 --> 15:27.663
I saw the corn.

15:28.918 --> 15:31.788
What do you mean, corn?
Were they out in the cornfield?

15:34.298 --> 15:37.051
Their blood was for the corn.

15:42.099 --> 15:43.925
Leave him alone.

15:45.435 --> 15:49.515
- I was just asking a couple of questions.
- I know what you were doing.

15:50.899 --> 15:53.189
Who do you write for, anyway?

15:53.277 --> 15:55.234
The World Inquirer.

15:55.321 --> 15:57.942
He's a ragman.

15:59.033 --> 16:00.907
Well... yes and no.

16:00.993 --> 16:03.698
I mean, I used to write for Newsweek.

16:03.788 --> 16:07.204
The editor and I,
we had a difference of opinion.

16:07.291 --> 16:10.210
I thought she was incompetent
and she didn't.

16:10.295 --> 16:13.581
Just chalk it up to youthful mistakes.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.959
Is there anything you haven't
chalked up to that?

16:18.094 --> 16:20.799
Would you mind excusing us for a minute?

16:20.889 --> 16:22.881
Sure.

16:25.645 --> 16:27.768
Outside. Now.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.741
I've about had it with you.

16:42.829 --> 16:46.993
I'm fully aware that you don't
want to be here with me,

16:47.083 --> 16:49.788
but, bub, you're no picnic for me either.

16:49.878 --> 16:52.962
The last thing I need
is you giving me shit.

16:53.048 --> 16:55.420
Just love these father-and-son chats.

16:55.508 --> 16:57.548
- Give me a break, please!
- Why?

16:57.635 --> 17:01.219
What for? What did you ever do for me?

17:01.307 --> 17:04.592
You got my mother pregnant,
and here I am.

17:04.685 --> 17:06.891
Hey, you listen to me now.

17:06.979 --> 17:10.395
Your mother and me,
we just couldn't make it work.

17:10.483 --> 17:12.392
We had our own agendas.

17:12.483 --> 17:14.607
And that didn't include me?

17:14.694 --> 17:18.112
No, it didn't. As a matter
of fact, it didn't.

17:18.199 --> 17:22.196
I won't bullshit you.
I was 17 and I made a mistake.

17:22.287 --> 17:26.237
You deal with that any way you can.
I'm still trying.

17:26.332 --> 17:30.116
If you can figure it out better than me,
that's fine,

17:30.211 --> 17:34.210
but who you are,
good or bad, is your choice.

17:36.385 --> 17:40.549
If it's my choice,
I'm on the next bus out of here.

17:40.639 --> 17:44.471
Wait. Whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey! Get back here!

17:47.521 --> 17:49.562
Don't worry. It'll be OK.

17:49.649 --> 17:51.689
No, it won't be OK.

17:51.776 --> 17:55.192
He'll go and do something
stupid just to spite me.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.319
Trust me. He'll be back.

18:28.773 --> 18:30.813
You with all the reporters?

18:30.900 --> 18:32.976
Sort of.

18:34.195 --> 18:36.484
So what are you doing?

18:36.573 --> 18:39.361
Just waiting for the next bus.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.444
Good move.

18:59.681 --> 19:03.097
You know, you might want
to get a couple magazines.

19:03.184 --> 19:05.390
The next bus isn't till Tuesday.

19:18.242 --> 19:21.575
Adults are dead,
yet the children of those adults...

19:22.996 --> 19:26.531
Corn. Blood for the corn.

19:29.963 --> 19:31.789
Why?

19:35.093 --> 19:37.381
Mordechai?

19:37.470 --> 19:39.961
Jedediah?

19:40.056 --> 19:42.095
Come on, guys, where are you?

19:43.309 --> 19:45.848
This isn't funny!

19:45.938 --> 19:47.977
Mordechai!

19:48.065 --> 19:49.892
Jedediah!

19:49.983 --> 19:51.810
Where are you?

19:53.904 --> 19:55.731
Guys?

19:57.950 --> 19:59.776
Where are you?

20:10.421 --> 20:12.461
Are you there?

20:15.718 --> 20:18.554
M... Mordechai?

20:23.685 --> 20:26.223
No!

20:26.313 --> 20:28.187
No!

20:28.273 --> 20:30.266
Argh! Ugh!

20:31.359 --> 20:33.648
No!

20:33.737 --> 20:36.359
Help! Argh!

20:39.702 --> 20:41.742
He took one again.

20:41.829 --> 20:44.367
Hear that?

20:50.880 --> 20:54.047
- Argh!
- What was that?

20:57.512 --> 20:59.339
I don't know.

21:00.432 --> 21:02.259
What do we do, Mordechai?

21:05.312 --> 21:09.061
- We wait.
- For what?

21:09.150 --> 21:12.982
For He Who Walks Behind the Rows
to show us the way.

21:13.070 --> 21:17.816
- And what if he doesn't?
- He will.

21:17.908 --> 21:20.530
- Isaac said...
- Isaac's dead!

21:22.747 --> 21:27.374
He told us when there were no more adults
we'd see the truth.

21:29.045 --> 21:30.872
Well, where is it?

21:30.964 --> 21:32.791
It is written -

21:32.883 --> 21:37.011
a leader will come from the corn,
he shall make us one.

21:37.095 --> 21:41.009
There ain't nothing out there,
Mordechai, except a lot of corn.

21:41.099 --> 21:43.887
Stupid old corn.

21:43.978 --> 21:47.145
Maybe that's your truth.

21:48.941 --> 21:52.357
Look, you can hang around here
if you want to.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.271
But we're out of here.

21:54.363 --> 21:56.569
No!

22:03.415 --> 22:06.866
He Who Walks Behind the Rows
shall not allow it.

22:08.086 --> 22:12.000
Do you really think it was
all Isaac's doing, Jedediah?

22:12.090 --> 22:13.917
Do you?

22:22.351 --> 22:25.222
Who here thinks this?

22:25.312 --> 22:28.147
Were we not given signs?

22:28.232 --> 22:30.271
Was that not enough?

22:30.359 --> 22:32.518
But they found them.

22:32.612 --> 22:35.150
And they found us.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.647
Jesus Christ, Micah, they know our parents.

22:37.742 --> 22:41.870
They were adults!
They were of that world.

22:41.955 --> 22:46.202
We have seen the way of that world
and it is evil.

22:46.292 --> 22:50.243
There is a power greater than all

22:50.339 --> 22:52.332
and it is within us.

22:52.424 --> 22:54.713
But we know it not.

22:54.802 --> 22:57.922
We have eyes but see it not

22:58.013 --> 23:00.053
and ears but hear it not.

23:01.308 --> 23:04.724
I saw the light that came from the corn.

23:04.812 --> 23:09.060
He Who Walks Behind the Rows
commands that we rid the land

23:09.150 --> 23:11.190
of all that defileth the corn.

23:14.447 --> 23:18.196
You do not see the truth, Jedediah,

23:18.284 --> 23:21.820
because it is not yet with us.

23:21.914 --> 23:24.950
There is work to do before he cometh.

23:25.042 --> 23:28.043
Go home

23:28.128 --> 23:30.251
and wait for a sign.

24:02.664 --> 24:04.491
Jesus Christ!

24:04.583 --> 24:06.410
Micah?

24:06.502 --> 24:09.075
What the hell are you doing?

24:09.171 --> 24:11.210
What are you doing out here?

24:11.298 --> 24:15.427
Well, I just... I-I saw the kids
and the flashlights and I was...

24:15.511 --> 24:19.011
Yeah. Well, it's fun to play at night.

24:20.141 --> 24:22.050
Yeah, I guess.

24:22.143 --> 24:24.848
So, were you in town?

24:24.937 --> 24:30.099
Yeah, I was going to leave,
but, er, I... ran into this girl.

24:30.194 --> 24:33.444
She's... she rides a motor scooter.
You know her?

24:33.530 --> 24:37.398
Mm-hm. Lacey Hellerstat.

24:40.746 --> 24:42.619
She's pretty hot.

24:43.749 --> 24:46.371
Yes. She's pretty hot.

24:49.505 --> 24:53.717
So, are you gonna go home now or what?

24:55.720 --> 24:57.759
Sure.

25:18.870 --> 25:21.361
I'll be right back.
Fine.

25:30.715 --> 25:33.466
Little devils!
Get away from here!

25:33.551 --> 25:35.710
Every one of you, move!

25:35.804 --> 25:38.805
Looking for answers? It's out there.

25:38.890 --> 25:40.717
Terrible things.

25:42.853 --> 25:48.357
- What are you talking about?
- Have you ever seen evil?

25:48.442 --> 25:50.564
It works through the children.

25:50.652 --> 25:54.567
Nobody would listen.
I told them in Gatlin. I showed them.

25:54.657 --> 25:57.113
- Showed them what?
- The drawings.

25:57.201 --> 25:59.408
By the little children.

25:59.495 --> 26:03.409
They knew. They knew.

26:03.499 --> 26:08.625
My husband walked into a cornfield
15 years ago.

26:08.714 --> 26:11.383
He never came back.

26:11.466 --> 26:15.927
That's why I'm moving out of here
and taking my house with me.

26:20.892 --> 26:24.142
God... damn you!

26:24.229 --> 26:26.306
Damn you!

26:38.911 --> 26:40.951
What the...?

26:55.178 --> 26:57.716
Well, boy, that was a mistake.

26:57.806 --> 27:00.262
So, did you get your story yet?

27:00.351 --> 27:02.676
What do you think?

27:02.770 --> 27:04.809
There's nothing to do around here.

27:04.897 --> 27:07.981
Now, how do you know that? Huh?

27:08.067 --> 27:11.483
How do you know?
Why not check it out first?

27:11.570 --> 27:13.942
There might be more around than corn.

27:14.031 --> 27:17.816
If there is, let me know.
I can use the help.

27:17.911 --> 27:19.950
Listen, for what it's worth,

27:20.038 --> 27:23.205
I appreciate that you didn't
take off last night.

27:23.291 --> 27:25.331
I didn't have much choice.

27:25.418 --> 27:27.660
Look, I'm going to walk, OK?

27:51.488 --> 27:53.943
Oh, God! Come on...

27:57.786 --> 28:00.822
It is like the light from the corn.

28:00.914 --> 28:06.419
Not from the hand of man, but the mark
of He Who Walks Behind the Rows.

28:08.214 --> 28:10.040
Then it is our sign?

28:16.889 --> 28:18.716
Yes.

28:19.808 --> 28:21.636
Let it begin.

29:01.728 --> 29:04.053
You just going to stand there?

29:07.608 --> 29:10.313
Haven't you ever seen a girl before?

29:11.446 --> 29:13.273
Er...

29:14.616 --> 29:17.487
No, no. I've never seen a girl before.

29:18.954 --> 29:20.994
Well, can you swim?

29:27.212 --> 29:29.502
Fornication.

29:29.591 --> 29:32.675
Fornication, my friends,

29:32.760 --> 29:35.334
is a pestilence.

29:35.430 --> 29:37.588
Look at each other.

29:37.682 --> 29:41.596
Go on. Look closely at each other.

29:41.686 --> 29:44.521
Go on. Look closely.

29:46.567 --> 29:50.944
That pestilence can dwell
inside each and every one of us.

29:51.029 --> 29:55.323
But before we can conquer it,
we must first recognise it.

29:57.202 --> 30:02.743
Now, we here in Hemingford
have just witnessed a terrible tragedy.

30:02.834 --> 30:08.420
Our good neighbours in Gatlin
have been called home to glory.

30:16.097 --> 30:18.174
Elmira?

30:19.184 --> 30:21.011
Elmira!

30:24.481 --> 30:27.233
Elmira, where in the world are you?

30:27.317 --> 30:29.725
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty!

30:29.820 --> 30:33.271
Kitty, kitty, kitty!

30:34.407 --> 30:38.537
I am in no mood
to have to go chasing after you.

30:38.621 --> 30:41.112
Kitty, kitty! Here, kitty!

30:41.207 --> 30:44.790
Here, kitty! Come on, you fool cat!
Where are you?

30:44.877 --> 30:48.412
Here, pussy cat! Here!

30:48.506 --> 30:50.712
Elmira!

30:56.431 --> 30:58.471
Elmira!

31:01.520 --> 31:05.434
Where are you? That fool cat! Elmira!

31:05.524 --> 31:10.863
Come on, cat! Here, kit, kit, kit, kitty!
Here, kitty! Come on, kitty!

31:11.906 --> 31:17.031
Elmira! Why don't you talk? Darn cat!
You're driving me crazy.

31:17.119 --> 31:18.946
Elmira!

31:30.759 --> 31:32.882
Oh, my God.

31:34.763 --> 31:36.590
Nice kitty.

31:36.681 --> 31:38.508
You bastards!

31:38.600 --> 31:40.676
You dirty little bastards!

31:40.769 --> 31:45.562
You get away from me!
You get the hell away from my house!

31:49.653 --> 31:53.947
You stop that! You get away!

32:05.253 --> 32:09.167
What a world! What a world!

32:34.117 --> 32:37.949
So, where are you from?
Long Island, New York.

32:38.038 --> 32:41.869
New York? Oh, my gosh.
I've always wanted to go there.

32:44.502 --> 32:46.329
It's OK.

32:46.421 --> 32:50.040
Sure, I mean, for you,
because you grew up there.

32:50.134 --> 32:52.173
You should try growing up here.

32:52.261 --> 32:55.594
There's nothing -
nothing to do, nothing to see,

32:55.681 --> 32:57.757
nobody interesting to talk to.

33:01.270 --> 33:04.971
Yeah, I used to feel that way
about this place.

33:25.087 --> 33:28.041
So how long will you be in town?

33:28.132 --> 33:30.623
Until my father finishes his story.

33:33.137 --> 33:35.176
What?

33:36.515 --> 33:38.592
I don't know. Um...

33:38.685 --> 33:42.184
It's strange
calling that guy my father.

33:43.314 --> 33:48.142
What is it between you? You guys
don't spend a lot of time together?

33:48.236 --> 33:50.359
We don't spend any time together.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.942
Anyway...

33:56.036 --> 34:00.164
Hey, um... did you know
any of those kids from Gatlin?

34:00.249 --> 34:03.748
Are you kidding?
I went to school with them.

34:03.836 --> 34:08.379
I never fit in. I guess I always
wanted to be somewhere else.

34:08.465 --> 34:13.626
But I swore to myself,
the day I turn 18, I am out of here.

34:13.721 --> 34:15.761
So what about your parents?

34:18.101 --> 34:20.936
They're dead.

34:21.020 --> 34:23.060
I'm sorry.

34:24.565 --> 34:27.934
- God. You mean they...?
- No, it wasn't in Gatlin.

34:28.027 --> 34:29.855
It was a car accident.

34:29.947 --> 34:33.731
My aunt and uncle took me in
so I moved here.

34:33.826 --> 34:35.947
I left before that stuff happened.

34:42.793 --> 34:44.620
What?

34:44.712 --> 34:47.083
Take me to New York with you.

34:47.172 --> 34:51.502
- What? I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

34:58.559 --> 35:04.396
The Bible tells us
that one must become as a little child

35:04.483 --> 35:07.400
to find the path from sin.

35:07.486 --> 35:10.191
Yet there are some...

35:12.199 --> 35:14.026
David?

35:14.117 --> 35:16.110
What's the matter?

35:16.203 --> 35:20.700
I don't know.
I think I'm coming down with a cold.

35:20.792 --> 35:22.831
Here.

35:22.919 --> 35:27.960
It is as bad
to find evil where it does not dwell

35:28.049 --> 35:31.334
as to fail to see it where it does.

35:39.353 --> 35:43.397
Heavy metal music
blaring out its profane message

35:43.482 --> 35:47.396
to the waiting ears
of our impressionable children.

35:47.486 --> 35:51.234
Movies are filled with violence, blood,

35:51.323 --> 35:58.821
and bodies, naked bodies,
writhing together, glorifying fornication!

35:58.915 --> 36:05.249
We are undone
by our grievous animal desires.

36:05.338 --> 36:08.873
And that is why

36:08.967 --> 36:11.754
you must look into yourselves

36:11.845 --> 36:14.003
to see if there is evil

36:14.097 --> 36:20.100
because that is where the evil lurks.

36:20.187 --> 36:22.013
Evil!

36:22.105 --> 36:24.394
Evil just waiting...

36:24.482 --> 36:27.520
Gee. Do you have another?

36:31.782 --> 36:33.193
Gee!

36:34.744 --> 36:37.365
It was their innocence that...

36:42.043 --> 36:44.581
Oh, David! Here.

36:47.340 --> 36:49.167
David!

36:51.970 --> 36:54.009
Oh!

37:10.281 --> 37:12.854
Argh!

37:15.870 --> 37:17.697
You've gotta help me!

37:35.015 --> 37:37.886
Come away, Mary. Come away!

37:37.977 --> 37:41.428
- No!
- Come away.

37:41.522 --> 37:44.273
David. No!

37:46.277 --> 37:49.029
David! No!

39:09.655 --> 39:12.610
All right,
I need two people up at the board.

39:12.701 --> 39:15.192
Eddie... Caroline.

39:15.287 --> 39:18.703
Come on up and write
these figures on the board,

39:18.791 --> 39:21.542
and then give us an answer.

40:23.358 --> 40:25.185
Ugh!

40:27.863 --> 40:30.270
Ugh! You scared the hell outta me!

40:31.366 --> 40:34.153
Who are you and why are you here?

40:34.244 --> 40:36.653
Isn't that just like a white man?

40:36.747 --> 40:39.784
Assumes he has the right to be here
and no one else does.

40:39.876 --> 40:43.825
All right, let's try it another way.
What do you know about all this?

40:43.921 --> 40:47.622
I know you're John Garrett,
reporter for the World Inquirer,

40:47.717 --> 40:53.139
35 years old in April...
and you weigh 185 pounds.

40:54.433 --> 40:59.593
Wait a minute. Hey, hey. How the hell
do you know all that about me?

40:59.688 --> 41:02.605
Even in a ghost town...

41:03.692 --> 41:07.108
don't leave your wallet
in a car that's not locked.

41:11.909 --> 41:13.736
Hey, wait a minute!

41:15.079 --> 41:17.368
Hold on a second. Wait a minute.

41:17.456 --> 41:20.908
All right, look,
I'm sorry about that back there.

41:21.001 --> 41:24.038
It's just, uh... What's your name?

41:24.130 --> 41:25.957
Frank Red Bear.

41:26.049 --> 41:29.003
Frank Red Bear, I'm Garrett.

41:29.094 --> 41:31.763
- Yes, I know.
- Yeah.

41:31.847 --> 41:35.512
Can you tell me anything about
what happened around here?

41:35.600 --> 41:38.174
- Koyaanisqatsi.
- Excuse me?

41:39.354 --> 41:44.147
Koyaanisqatsi. It means
"life out of balance".

41:45.111 --> 41:47.187
My ancestors would've told you

41:47.279 --> 41:50.613
that man should be at one
with the earth, the sky, the water.

41:50.699 --> 41:53.451
But the white man
has never understood this.

41:53.536 --> 41:55.575
He only knows how to take.

41:55.663 --> 41:58.748
And after a while, there's
nothing left to take

41:58.834 --> 42:03.246
so everything is out of balance...
and we all fall down.

42:06.049 --> 42:10.129
Wait a minute.
So that's what happened here in Gatlin?

42:10.220 --> 42:12.259
No, what happened in Gatlin

42:12.347 --> 42:15.384
was those kids went apeshit
and killed everybody.

42:16.644 --> 42:18.850
Right. But why?

42:18.938 --> 42:23.185
The Amish say we don't inherit
the land from our ancestors,

42:23.275 --> 42:25.683
we only borrow it from our children.

42:25.778 --> 42:27.770
Maybe they wanted it back.

42:27.863 --> 42:31.280
Wait a sec.
This school teacher here, this Mrs Burke.

42:31.368 --> 42:35.496
She said the kids knew about it.
It's in all their drawings.

42:35.580 --> 42:37.738
- Look at these.
- Yeah.

42:37.832 --> 42:40.240
These kids watch too many horror flicks.

42:40.335 --> 42:46.254
No, they drew these before this happened,
and weren't in on it, so how did they know?

42:46.341 --> 42:49.461
Beats the hell outta me.

42:53.724 --> 42:58.018
Hold on a second! How do I get hold of you?

42:58.103 --> 43:00.890
You can reach me
through the State University -

43:00.981 --> 43:02.808
department of anthropology.

43:02.900 --> 43:05.273
Just ask for me - Dr Red Bear.

43:11.743 --> 43:14.115
That shit ate right through my pants.

43:40.815 --> 43:43.140
Oh, my God, it's Ruby!

43:43.234 --> 43:46.401
It's Ruby! Who killed my sister?

43:46.487 --> 43:48.527
It was an accident, Ms West.

43:48.615 --> 43:50.654
Not with them around it wasn't!

43:51.743 --> 43:53.569
She warned you.

43:54.913 --> 43:56.823
She warned all of you!

43:58.375 --> 44:01.127
What did you do to her?

44:06.467 --> 44:08.376
My God.

44:08.468 --> 44:14.056
Sheriff... I am not gonna let this drop!

44:15.602 --> 44:17.974
Get me out of here, goddammit!

44:18.062 --> 44:20.351
You're blind, you fools!

44:20.440 --> 44:22.516
You fools!

44:22.608 --> 44:25.479
You let the wolf in your door!

44:25.570 --> 44:28.690
That's what you did! You stupid idiots!

44:31.952 --> 44:35.036
Take her to Doc Appleby's.
I'll call the coroner.

44:35.122 --> 44:36.865
OK, Sheriff.

44:37.958 --> 44:42.454
I've gotta check on some things.
Stick around here till I get back.

44:42.546 --> 44:44.373
Wha...? Where's here?

44:44.465 --> 44:46.921
Here. Here! Why are you all wet?

44:47.010 --> 44:50.793
I was swimming. There's this
watering hole just down the way.

44:50.888 --> 44:52.928
I met a girl and we...

44:53.015 --> 44:57.476
Wait, hey, I don't want you hanging
around with these kids around here.

44:57.562 --> 44:59.388
That's good, you know?

44:59.480 --> 45:03.265
First you say, "Check it out,
there's more than corn there,"

45:03.360 --> 45:06.112
and now I can't hang out with anyone.

45:06.196 --> 45:08.568
- Why not?
- I said so.

45:08.657 --> 45:13.485
- Why can't you trust me?
- No, just do what I told you.

45:23.965 --> 45:25.791
Another argument?

45:25.883 --> 45:29.667
Yeah... yeah, I can handle it. It's fine.

45:29.762 --> 45:33.890
You know, Danny, I used to have
problems with my father too.

45:33.975 --> 45:36.264
Adults are such hypocrites.

45:36.353 --> 45:41.513
It's like the moment a person turns 19,
they become this thing.

45:41.608 --> 45:44.064
What thing?

45:44.152 --> 45:47.402
Well... with my father,

45:47.489 --> 45:52.366
if we listened to the radio, we sinned.

45:53.496 --> 45:56.746
If we talked to girls, we sinned.

45:58.084 --> 46:02.164
And every sin demanded a beating.

46:04.090 --> 46:06.296
To chase away the devil.

46:09.721 --> 46:11.844
And then one day...

46:12.933 --> 46:16.977
I caught my father with
the farmhand's wife.

46:18.522 --> 46:23.018
Sinning most vigorously.

46:26.530 --> 46:32.070
Micah... were you glad
when your father was killed?

46:33.954 --> 46:37.655
The Bible also teaches that, um...

46:37.750 --> 46:41.831
for everything there is a season.

46:46.760 --> 46:50.804
You actually see a connection between
a nose bleed and the house falling?

46:50.889 --> 46:52.881
Yeah, they're both dead.

46:52.974 --> 46:56.758
It seems to happen a lot around here.
You notice that?

46:56.853 --> 46:58.930
I don't appreciate your humour.

47:00.066 --> 47:03.850
Well... what could make a man
bleed to death like this, then?

47:04.987 --> 47:07.145
I wouldn't know.

47:07.239 --> 47:11.367
You don't have a lot of statistics
on nose-bleed deaths, is that it?

47:12.995 --> 47:14.823
I'll tell you one thing -

47:14.915 --> 47:18.330
we know what killed
old Ms Burke here, don't we?

47:19.836 --> 47:24.664
Did you ever notice a green mould or dust?

47:26.301 --> 47:28.128
No.

47:29.345 --> 47:32.383
Sure bothered her. It was on her door.

47:34.143 --> 47:36.219
I've got no idea.

47:38.397 --> 47:40.970
I don't snoop around other people's doors.

47:45.571 --> 47:47.610
She was talking about the corn.

47:47.698 --> 47:50.106
I guess that bothered her too.

47:51.661 --> 47:55.445
Her husband walked out into
a cornfield about 15 years ago

47:55.540 --> 47:57.367
and never came back.

47:59.294 --> 48:01.251
Oh, he... walked out, all right.

48:01.337 --> 48:04.423
Right into the arms of a waitress in Omaha.

48:04.508 --> 48:08.292
Mrs Burke became quite mad. Crazy.

48:08.387 --> 48:11.471
I wouldn't put much stock in what she said.

48:11.557 --> 48:15.341
Well, now, maybe it was the truth
that made her crazy.

48:15.436 --> 48:17.475
Ever think of that?

48:19.565 --> 48:22.982
The kids around here -
they talk about the corn too.

48:24.154 --> 48:27.238
You think they had
anything to do with this?

48:27.323 --> 48:30.906
- I didn't say anything of the kind.
- No, you didn't.

48:30.994 --> 48:33.698
But you were thinking it, weren't you?

48:37.125 --> 48:39.877
You know what your problem is, Mr Garrett?

48:39.962 --> 48:44.754
You don't care about what happened here,
so long as it makes a good story.

48:44.842 --> 48:49.587
You don't know what it is to have
your whole livelihood resting on the land.

48:49.680 --> 48:53.724
It changes things. It changes everything.

48:55.854 --> 48:58.012
Now, if you will excuse me...

48:59.232 --> 49:01.639
I've got a lot of work to do.

49:05.738 --> 49:07.565
Thanks for your time.

49:30.515 --> 49:32.342
'Sheriff Blaine. '

49:32.433 --> 49:35.849
- He was here.
- 'Did you tell him anything? '

49:35.937 --> 49:37.764
Of course I didn't!

49:37.855 --> 49:42.564
For Christ's sake...
what do you think I am, an idiot?

49:42.652 --> 49:49.735
- 'Well, does he know what's going on? '
- No, but if he stays around here, he will.

49:49.826 --> 49:54.287
Oh, Jesus.
We have sinned and we're going to hell.

50:00.504 --> 50:03.256
Hey, wait a second.
Wait a second!

50:03.341 --> 50:05.380
These shoes cost me 135 bucks!

50:05.468 --> 50:07.710
Whoa. Whoa.

50:13.351 --> 50:16.767
Man, I knew I never
should've even called you.

50:26.990 --> 50:29.149
This is what I wanted to show you.

50:33.789 --> 50:36.826
My people believe
that this area was very special.

50:37.919 --> 50:42.331
- Don't you mean weird?
- No. This place has power.

50:44.467 --> 50:46.839
Power that can magnify good or bad.

50:48.638 --> 50:50.796
You can see by the drawings

50:50.890 --> 50:53.596
that the children were
particularly vulnerable.

50:53.685 --> 50:55.512
They feel the vibrations.

50:55.604 --> 50:57.513
What's that supposed to mean?

50:57.606 --> 51:02.944
Well, legend has it that a tribe of farmers
lived here a long time ago,

51:03.028 --> 51:06.029
but the adults became lazy
and they stopped farming.

51:06.114 --> 51:08.606
They began to abuse the animals
and the land.

51:09.660 --> 51:11.700
Now, you can see by these

51:11.787 --> 51:17.078
that the children rebelled
and killed their parents, like in Gatlin.

51:17.168 --> 51:19.456
Wait. What is this over here?

51:19.545 --> 51:22.332
Well, that's a traditional Indian burial.

51:22.423 --> 51:24.749
And all this along here?

51:24.843 --> 51:28.710
This indicates that
the spirit will open the corn

51:28.805 --> 51:32.257
and let through one who finds truth
within himself.

51:32.350 --> 51:35.969
Right, so why this flat line
across here then?

51:37.188 --> 51:39.561
Well, that line means it hasn't happened.

51:40.734 --> 51:44.151
So, do you really take
all this bullshit seriously, huh?

51:45.281 --> 51:49.113
You're a university professor,
for Christ's sake.

51:49.201 --> 51:52.950
Sometimes what you've learned
conflicts with what you know.

51:57.293 --> 52:00.378
All right, but what exactly is this?

52:03.466 --> 52:08.294
'... will be the ruin
of us all - sexual perversion!

52:08.388 --> 52:13.465
'Now the simple rule of
love thy neighbour as thyself

52:13.560 --> 52:17.393
'reduced to pornographic obscenity.

52:17.481 --> 52:19.688
'What have we become?

52:19.775 --> 52:24.603
'A deranged reality of
the new Sodom and Gomorrah?

52:24.697 --> 52:29.193
'No! There is redemption.

52:29.285 --> 52:32.037
'There is redemption!

52:32.122 --> 52:36.949
'The Lord said, "Be kind to those
who know not what they do."

52:37.043 --> 52:40.792
'And that is why we are here tonight.

52:42.006 --> 52:44.497
'To lift thine eyes to the heavens,

52:44.592 --> 52:49.504
'to see the true spirit of the Lord
and to ask for forgiveness.

52:50.599 --> 52:56.104
'Now, we have sinned against
each other and against our own selves.

52:57.940 --> 53:00.182
'But there is a way to salvation. '

53:13.790 --> 53:15.829
Who's there?

53:19.254 --> 53:21.081
Who's there?

53:47.492 --> 53:48.523
Ugh!

53:52.747 --> 53:57.209
The earth shall be cleansed
of those who poison earth and its youth.

53:57.294 --> 54:01.043
- It is written.
- You don't know what you're doing!

54:01.131 --> 54:03.883
Ye shall suffer for the sins of others.

54:03.967 --> 54:06.007
Repent that which you have sinned.

54:08.096 --> 54:10.933
You kids are in... in serious trouble!

54:11.017 --> 54:14.053
Argh! Oh! Argh! Oh!

54:14.145 --> 54:16.470
I like to play!

54:17.941 --> 54:21.392
Argh! Argh! Ugh!

54:25.073 --> 54:26.899
Argh!

54:40.005 --> 54:43.041
My mommy says I'm smart!

55:02.029 --> 55:03.855
Tell me something.

55:07.117 --> 55:09.157
What are you doing here?

55:09.244 --> 55:11.071
Why are you here?

55:12.956 --> 55:14.949
I don't know exactly.

55:15.042 --> 55:19.503
I mean, I was a sales executive
pulling in 100 grand a year...

55:19.589 --> 55:21.462
Oh, come on. $100,000?

55:21.549 --> 55:24.254
Yeah. I was hot stuff.

55:24.343 --> 55:28.673
I had a penthouse condo, beautiful sunsets,

55:28.764 --> 55:31.718
great sex with a scumbag attorney.

55:32.768 --> 55:34.928
- But that's all it was.
- What's that?

55:35.022 --> 55:36.848
Sex.

55:38.942 --> 55:43.403
And when Aunt Bea died,
I just sold the condo and moved here.

55:43.488 --> 55:46.193
There's something here I like.

55:46.283 --> 55:48.655
Yeah, me too.

56:42.259 --> 56:44.085
Dad...

56:44.177 --> 56:46.549
Sinning most vigorously.

57:08.160 --> 57:13.747
And in my vision, I saw a circle of light.

57:15.502 --> 57:19.914
And the lights moved faster and faster.

57:20.006 --> 57:25.001
And in the centre of the light was a stalk.

57:25.095 --> 57:31.181
And a voice spoke, commanding me
to cleanse the stalk of its poison...

57:32.520 --> 57:34.845
To make it pure again.

57:38.400 --> 57:40.773
Are you ready to join us, Ruth?

57:47.326 --> 57:49.154
I'm ready.

57:51.581 --> 57:54.784
The sower of seeds must be a child

57:54.876 --> 57:57.996
so that what is planted
is without corruption,

57:58.088 --> 58:01.291
untainted by the poisons of age.

58:01.382 --> 58:03.790
With the harvest moon tomorrow night,

58:03.885 --> 58:07.385
our reign of peace shall
dwell upon the land

58:07.473 --> 58:11.720
and the sword of righteousness
shall strike down the infidel.

58:31.122 --> 58:32.949
Now...

58:33.041 --> 58:37.334
let Gatlin and Hemingford

58:37.420 --> 58:40.671
be joined forever.

58:41.925 --> 58:44.796
We are one.

58:45.888 --> 58:48.461
We are one!

58:49.558 --> 58:52.179
We are one.

58:52.269 --> 58:55.187
We are one!

58:55.273 --> 58:59.520
We are one. We are one.

58:59.611 --> 59:04.319
We are one. We are one.

59:04.407 --> 59:06.483
We are one.

59:06.576 --> 59:08.403
We are one.

59:10.998 --> 59:12.825
Come forward.

59:15.419 --> 59:17.246
Come forward.

59:29.100 --> 59:31.887
This is Danny.

59:31.978 --> 59:36.022
He too has found problems among them.

59:36.107 --> 59:40.235
Will you be a soldier for
He Who Walks Behind the Rows?

59:41.863 --> 59:44.271
Do you wish to be as one?

59:48.579 --> 59:50.405
Yes.

01:00:08.474 --> 01:00:10.514
This is your favourite place?

01:00:10.601 --> 01:00:12.428
Well, sort of.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:15.141
Come on. I want to show you.

01:00:45.221 --> 01:00:47.260
Isn't this great?

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.345
Don't you feel like
you could look at that forever?

01:00:51.436 --> 01:00:53.762
That's why I love it here.

01:00:53.855 --> 01:00:56.393
I look out there toward the horizon,

01:00:56.483 --> 01:00:59.899
I almost see myself out there -
far away from here.

01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:10.242
Don't tell me you're afraid of heights.

01:01:10.331 --> 01:01:13.201
No. Well...

01:01:13.292 --> 01:01:16.708
I mean, I wouldn't say afraid.

01:01:16.796 --> 01:01:22.003
But one time I went to the top
of the Statue of Liberty, I, um...

01:01:23.135 --> 01:01:26.968
You know, I... I barfed on her dress.

01:01:29.017 --> 01:01:32.766
Well, if you barf, I'm
not going to kiss you.

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.732
Whoa. Well, then I won't barf.

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:48.110
Are you OK?

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:51.205
- You feel better?
- Yeah.

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:54.493
- A lot better?
- Yeah, I feel better.

01:01:54.585 --> 01:01:56.412
Good.

01:01:56.504 --> 01:01:59.920
Cos if you can catch me,
you can have me.

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:08.012
Where are you going?

01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:10.139
Come on!

01:02:26.577 --> 01:02:29.613
What?

01:02:29.705 --> 01:02:31.948
Come back! Lacey.

01:02:32.042 --> 01:02:34.367
Hurry up!

01:03:45.702 --> 01:03:47.528
Something's back there.

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:49.660
I'll get it. I'll get it.

01:03:54.753 --> 01:03:56.580
- Wh-what is that?
- Uh...

01:03:56.672 --> 01:03:59.079
What is it?

01:03:59.174 --> 01:04:01.250
What are you doing?

01:04:01.343 --> 01:04:03.170
Oh, God.

01:04:09.726 --> 01:04:12.100
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

01:04:12.188 --> 01:04:14.596
It must be the bodies they never found.

01:04:15.692 --> 01:04:18.562
Danny, come on. Let's get out of here.

01:04:26.202 --> 01:04:29.287
- Look at all this corn.
- Yeah, look at it.

01:04:29.373 --> 01:04:31.412
What the hell is this stuff doing here?

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.955
It's where they store it, isn't it?

01:04:34.044 --> 01:04:37.460
They're supposed to be harvesting
all that corn out there.

01:04:37.548 --> 01:04:39.587
This should be empty.

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:42.545
What the hell is this stuff doing here?

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:51.931
My God. This is last year's corn.

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:58.564
That green stuff is... is... is aflatoxin,
an ergot mould.

01:04:58.653 --> 01:05:01.524
Toxic as hell. It grows on the corn.

01:05:02.241 --> 01:05:06.369
My God, some people think all
the chemical pesticides contribute to it.

01:05:06.453 --> 01:05:08.825
I mean, this silo's full of it.

01:05:08.914 --> 01:05:11.665
If it's toxic, why are
they hanging onto it?

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:14.075
To blend with this year's crop.

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:19.170
- What, to hide it?
- No, to sell it.

01:05:20.093 --> 01:05:23.924
There's a hell of a lot of money
tied up in this harvest.

01:05:24.013 --> 01:05:26.800
Doc Appleby knew. He was talking about it.

01:05:27.892 --> 01:05:30.430
Exposure to this stuff can poison, too.

01:05:31.562 --> 01:05:34.766
- Simpson.
- He didn't even have to eat it.

01:05:34.858 --> 01:05:37.431
All he did was breathe it.
We all breathed it.

01:05:37.527 --> 01:05:41.655
The dust off this corn
must have blown clear over the valley.

01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:43.779
Why doesn't it affect more people?

01:05:43.867 --> 01:05:48.529
It does. They just don't know it.
It could be a cold or a cough.

01:05:48.622 --> 01:05:51.873
The immune system has
different ways of handling it.

01:05:51.959 --> 01:05:55.162
Over time, when it's eaten
at you long enough,

01:05:55.254 --> 01:05:59.833
aflatoxin can cause...
God, it can cause madness,

01:05:59.926 --> 01:06:01.965
it can cause panic, hallucinations,

01:06:02.053 --> 01:06:04.010
especially in chil...

01:06:05.306 --> 01:06:07.346
Especially in children.

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:10.930
In children particularly.

01:06:13.482 --> 01:06:16.933
Hey, Sheriff, I think we got a problem.

01:06:18.361 --> 01:06:20.401
I think you may be right.

01:06:39.467 --> 01:06:42.219
Get that thing away from me!

01:06:51.187 --> 01:06:54.556
Don't think you can scare me,
you little punks.

01:06:54.649 --> 01:06:56.476
Get out of here.

01:06:59.697 --> 01:07:01.524
Watch this.

01:07:01.615 --> 01:07:04.153
What's going on here? Help!

01:07:04.243 --> 01:07:06.734
What have you done to my chair?

01:07:09.039 --> 01:07:11.957
N-39.

01:07:12.042 --> 01:07:15.543
Help! You little bastards!

01:07:17.841 --> 01:07:21.257
Somebody has to help me. Help me!

01:07:22.345 --> 01:07:26.010
Will somebody help me?

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:36.024
Can somebody help me?

01:07:37.361 --> 01:07:39.650
What's going on here?

01:07:39.738 --> 01:07:43.606
Somebody help me, please!

01:07:43.701 --> 01:07:46.073
O-54.

01:07:51.543 --> 01:07:54.413
Somebody stop this thing!

01:07:55.505 --> 01:07:57.332
Thank you.

01:07:57.424 --> 01:08:00.460
Thank you, Lord. Thank you.

01:08:10.062 --> 01:08:11.971
O-65.

01:08:12.064 --> 01:08:13.973
Yeah! Yeah!

01:08:26.078 --> 01:08:27.953
Bingo?

01:08:29.957 --> 01:08:31.783
No, nobody's home.

01:08:31.876 --> 01:08:35.292
'My aunt left a note
about a town meeting. We gotta... '

01:08:37.299 --> 01:08:41.379
Hello? Lacey? Hello? Hello?

01:08:46.934 --> 01:08:48.761
It's time, Danny.

01:08:48.852 --> 01:08:51.971
The soldiers of the Lord
are ready to march.

01:08:54.609 --> 01:08:57.361
So Doctor Appleby was in on this, too?

01:08:57.444 --> 01:08:59.484
Along with a few others.

01:08:59.572 --> 01:09:02.988
The government will nail you
when they test that corn.

01:09:03.076 --> 01:09:06.160
Actually, they only test
a portion of the shipment.

01:09:06.245 --> 01:09:10.113
If you pay the right folks,
they only test the good parts.

01:09:10.207 --> 01:09:15.203
The government's changing their standards
to help the economy so why can't we?

01:09:15.296 --> 01:09:18.049
That aflatoxin may kill
a lot of innocent people.

01:09:18.133 --> 01:09:22.380
- You'll take that chance?
- I'm going to kill you two, ain't I?

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:27.725
So you really think
you can get away with this?

01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:31.594
Sure I can. I'll be heading
the investigation into your murder.

01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:36.268
Some people still think the only
good Indian is a dead Indian.

01:09:36.361 --> 01:09:39.611
Fuck you, pencil-dick.

01:09:39.697 --> 01:09:42.568
Why don't you just shoot us?

01:09:42.658 --> 01:09:46.787
I'd actually have to explain that
and someone might not believe me.

01:09:46.872 --> 01:09:49.742
This... I don't have to explain this.

01:09:49.832 --> 01:09:54.246
Who could? It doesn't make sense.
Which is the beauty of it.

01:09:54.338 --> 01:09:56.626
It'll be a mystery... unsolved.

01:09:56.715 --> 01:09:59.799
It'll be part of the
folklore of the valley.

01:10:01.304 --> 01:10:03.676
It's also a terrible way to die.

01:10:07.685 --> 01:10:12.264
Oh, uh, I'd love to sit and chat
but there's a town meeting.

01:10:12.356 --> 01:10:14.432
Some people are actually worried

01:10:14.525 --> 01:10:17.361
about problems with our
sweet, innocent children.

01:10:27.331 --> 01:10:29.822
You boys are going to love this!

01:10:38.926 --> 01:10:41.168
Like a big quasinart, ain't it?

01:10:45.433 --> 01:10:48.932
Try and get this out of the ground.
One, two, three!

01:10:51.064 --> 01:10:52.523
Come on now!

01:10:53.692 --> 01:10:56.064
One more!

01:10:56.945 --> 01:10:59.650
Three! Come on!

01:11:02.742 --> 01:11:05.946
One... two...

01:11:10.585 --> 01:11:14.084
- Argh!
- Roll over on your side. Come on!

01:11:51.627 --> 01:11:54.747
Ruth, what are you doing here?

01:11:54.839 --> 01:11:57.212
This is for you.

01:12:00.929 --> 01:12:02.968
What do you mean, for me?

01:12:03.056 --> 01:12:06.390
It's time. You must be dressed.

01:12:06.476 --> 01:12:08.718
Don't. Let me go.
Let me go!

01:12:19.532 --> 01:12:22.568
God, it's McKenzie.

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:24.486
Over here.

01:12:31.211 --> 01:12:33.203
And that's Bobby.

01:12:34.965 --> 01:12:38.748
Don't try to tell me
some goddamn poison corn did this.

01:12:38.843 --> 01:12:42.923
You level with me.
What in the fuck is going on here?

01:12:43.014 --> 01:12:45.552
Einstein was right.

01:12:46.684 --> 01:12:49.223
We didn't evolve out of random chance.

01:12:50.981 --> 01:12:53.768
There's a higher power
controlling all of this.

01:12:53.859 --> 01:12:56.564
My ancestors believed in a spirit -

01:12:56.654 --> 01:12:58.693
a spirit of the earth,

01:12:58.781 --> 01:13:02.992
a god who seeks revenge
for the wrongs done to the earth.

01:13:03.077 --> 01:13:05.450
- This is what's happening.
- Bullshit!

01:13:05.538 --> 01:13:10.034
That's your answer?
That God did this? That God's pissed?

01:13:10.126 --> 01:13:12.083
You've got a better one?

01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:25.678
- Hello, Mary.
- Hi, Bob.

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.809
- Sheriff.
- How are you, Bob?

01:13:31.231 --> 01:13:33.983
Ladies and gentlemen,
friends and neighbours.

01:13:34.068 --> 01:13:37.069
We can't wait.
We need to get the meeting started.

01:13:37.155 --> 01:13:40.239
Come dawn, a lot of you want to be
in the field for harvest.

01:13:40.325 --> 01:13:42.364
We need to get the meeting under way.

01:13:42.452 --> 01:13:45.203
- But people are still missing.
- We can't wait.

01:13:45.288 --> 01:13:48.040
Reverend, would you lead us
in the invocation?

01:13:48.124 --> 01:13:50.164
Yeah, sure.

01:13:50.251 --> 01:13:55.673
Lord, let your wisdom cleanse our hearts
and guide our minds

01:13:55.758 --> 01:13:59.802
so that our actions are free
from fornication, lies, debauchery, lust

01:13:59.887 --> 01:14:02.259
and all manner of sin and damnation.

01:14:02.347 --> 01:14:04.174
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:14:04.266 --> 01:14:06.093
Thank you, Reverend.

01:14:06.185 --> 01:14:09.600
Some of you agreed
to take in the Gatlin children.

01:14:09.688 --> 01:14:12.606
Some expressed a desire
to file for adoption,

01:14:12.692 --> 01:14:15.064
so I've got some information on that.

01:14:15.153 --> 01:14:16.980
Yes, Mary?

01:14:17.071 --> 01:14:21.069
I have something to say.
It's about the children.

01:14:24.162 --> 01:14:26.201
There's something out there.

01:14:27.666 --> 01:14:30.038
There's something... It's evil.

01:14:31.712 --> 01:14:34.203
It's gotten a hold of our children.

01:14:35.465 --> 01:14:39.878
- Speak to her, Reverend.
- Mary. Mary Simpson.

01:14:39.970 --> 01:14:41.797
We love you dearly

01:14:41.888 --> 01:14:46.018
and we grieve for the loss
of your dear husband and your sister.

01:14:46.102 --> 01:14:49.720
But to blame every affliction
on the children of Gatlin...

01:14:49.814 --> 01:14:52.222
- That's not it!
- It's just not Christian.

01:14:59.657 --> 01:15:04.320
Perhaps we should ask
the children to leave.

01:15:04.413 --> 01:15:06.571
What? The children.

01:15:06.665 --> 01:15:10.116
- The children are here.
- Please try to control yourself.

01:15:14.423 --> 01:15:17.508
The sweet children of Gatlin
have chained the door.

01:15:17.593 --> 01:15:21.757
What? All right, children,
the prank's over.

01:15:21.848 --> 01:15:23.674
Open the door.

01:15:28.771 --> 01:15:32.021
Oren, they've got matches
and they've got gasoline!

01:15:32.108 --> 01:15:33.936
What?

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.950
Somebody help me!

01:15:40.033 --> 01:15:42.405
Wait till I get those little bastards.

01:15:42.494 --> 01:15:44.321
You...

01:15:44.413 --> 01:15:47.413
We can't get out here. Go out the window!

01:15:52.463 --> 01:15:54.586
You little shits!

01:16:03.766 --> 01:16:05.593
Argh!

01:16:09.272 --> 01:16:12.357
My Lord!

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:42.052
That is the funeral pyre
of those that have poisoned our world.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.056
All the adults are gone!

01:16:47.646 --> 01:16:52.473
You are one with us now.
There are no others to come between us.

01:16:52.567 --> 01:16:59.899
Tonight, my brothers and sisters,
is harvest moon.

01:16:59.992 --> 01:17:02.863
And the new harvest is ours,

01:17:02.953 --> 01:17:06.453
as the sons and daughters
of the one true father -

01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:08.829
He Who Walks Behind the Rows.

01:17:08.918 --> 01:17:13.165
And tonight, he calls on us to serve him.

01:17:15.008 --> 01:17:18.708
Danny, are you ready for the offering?

01:17:18.803 --> 01:17:21.211
Yes.

01:17:21.306 --> 01:17:25.138
Then say it, Danny.
Say that you are one with us!

01:17:25.226 --> 01:17:27.552
We are one!

01:17:27.645 --> 01:17:29.472
We are one!

01:17:29.564 --> 01:17:35.319
We are one! We are one! We are one!

01:17:35.404 --> 01:17:41.656
We are one! We are one!
We are one!

01:17:41.744 --> 01:17:43.867
Give me your hand, Danny!

01:17:43.954 --> 01:17:46.243
We are one! We are one!

01:17:46.332 --> 01:17:49.784
Lift your hand to
He Who Walks Behind the Rows.

01:17:49.878 --> 01:17:55.120
We are one! We are one! We are one!

01:17:55.216 --> 01:17:59.048
We are one! We are one!

01:17:59.137 --> 01:18:02.969
We are one! We are one!

01:18:03.057 --> 01:18:08.053
We are one! We are one! We are...

01:18:08.147 --> 01:18:10.852
Silence!
We are one...

01:18:16.530 --> 01:18:19.864
Danny! Danny, tell them to stop this!

01:18:21.119 --> 01:18:22.946
Danny!

01:18:24.289 --> 01:18:27.492
She is the first to be sacrificed!

01:18:27.584 --> 01:18:30.999
Danny, get me out of here!
You little bastard!

01:18:31.087 --> 01:18:33.080
First, cut out her tongue!

01:18:33.172 --> 01:18:37.586
Then, when her pitiful
protestations are silenced,

01:18:37.678 --> 01:18:39.920
carve out her heart!

01:18:40.014 --> 01:18:42.302
For God sakes, Danny!

01:18:42.391 --> 01:18:47.017
Each drop of their blood
shall nourish the seeds of new life!

01:18:47.104 --> 01:18:50.769
Let the new harvest begin!

01:18:53.443 --> 01:18:57.525
We are one! We are one!

01:18:57.615 --> 01:19:01.530
We are one! We are one!

01:19:01.619 --> 01:19:05.487
We are one! We are one!

01:19:05.581 --> 01:19:07.408
Danny, listen to me!

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.706
- We are one!
- Micah, stop it!

01:19:09.794 --> 01:19:11.622
We are one!

01:19:13.799 --> 01:19:15.792
Danny!

01:19:19.513 --> 01:19:22.680
- It's the light from the corn.
- He's coming!

01:19:22.766 --> 01:19:26.301
Now, Danny! He calls for it!

01:19:26.395 --> 01:19:30.228
We are one! We are one!

01:19:30.316 --> 01:19:34.729
We are one! We are one!

01:19:34.821 --> 01:19:38.605
We are one! We are one!

01:19:38.699 --> 01:19:42.033
- Danny, I love you. Please!
- Now, Danny!

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:57.006
The party's over!

01:19:58.762 --> 01:20:02.132
We are one! We are... Argh!

01:20:05.978 --> 01:20:08.600
Kill the outlanders!

01:20:19.034 --> 01:20:20.861
Danny, watch out!

01:20:22.955 --> 01:20:25.446
Danny, get her out of there!

01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:27.663
Come on, let's go!

01:20:31.838 --> 01:20:33.748
Frank! Frank, over here!

01:20:35.843 --> 01:20:38.132
Ugh! Ugh!

01:20:44.769 --> 01:20:45.800
No!

01:20:48.189 --> 01:20:50.229
Right, come on. Come on!

01:21:07.168 --> 01:21:09.207
Ruth, go! Go, go, go!

01:21:09.295 --> 01:21:12.498
Get them, or we all shall
suffer the consequences

01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:14.997
of He Who Walks Behind the Rows!

01:21:19.388 --> 01:21:21.595
Go! Go!

01:21:26.688 --> 01:21:30.852
Oh, what... what's going on?
We should've hit the road by now.

01:21:30.942 --> 01:21:32.769
Something!

01:21:32.861 --> 01:21:35.731
No, let's go this way.

01:21:56.218 --> 01:21:58.046
Go! Go! Go!

01:22:08.815 --> 01:22:11.436
This stuff doesn't end. It doesn't end!

01:22:11.526 --> 01:22:13.353
That way.

01:22:28.168 --> 01:22:30.660
- Move!
- All right.

01:22:31.756 --> 01:22:35.172
Hold it now. Hold it, just hold it.
Let's go.

01:22:37.762 --> 01:22:42.223
Take it easy. Take it easy now.
Watch it. Easy. Take it easy.

01:22:56.949 --> 01:22:59.321
Did you really think

01:22:59.410 --> 01:23:03.194
that He Who Walks Behind the Rows

01:23:03.288 --> 01:23:07.073
would allow you to escape?

01:23:11.506 --> 01:23:14.460
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:23:16.219 --> 01:23:20.514
Danny... you disappoint me.

01:23:20.599 --> 01:23:24.051
Now you must be treated
just like the others.

01:23:24.144 --> 01:23:26.600
- Stop this now.
- Silence!

01:23:30.025 --> 01:23:31.934
- Argh!
- Hey!

01:23:32.027 --> 01:23:33.854
Move it back!

01:23:35.906 --> 01:23:41.150
The blood of those that defileth the corn
must flow into the earth!

01:23:42.539 --> 01:23:44.994
Kneel!

01:23:47.293 --> 01:23:49.120
Kneel!

01:23:50.463 --> 01:23:55.671
Argh! Argh!

01:23:55.761 --> 01:23:58.050
Argh!

01:24:03.185 --> 01:24:06.969
Argh!

01:24:07.064 --> 01:24:10.564
Argh!

01:24:13.321 --> 01:24:17.817
Argh! Argh!

01:24:21.871 --> 01:24:23.698
Argh! Argh!

01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:26.910
Argh! Argh! Argh!

01:24:33.258 --> 01:24:35.085
- Go! Go!
- OK!

01:24:35.177 --> 01:24:37.549
Somebody help me!

01:24:37.638 --> 01:24:39.761
Danny, please!

01:24:39.848 --> 01:24:41.722
Come on! Danny, come on!

01:24:41.808 --> 01:24:44.383
Please, Danny! You're my friend!

01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:47.230
Danny, get the girls and get outta here!

01:24:47.315 --> 01:24:49.272
Danny, please!

01:24:52.278 --> 01:24:56.406
- I was there for you!
- I said get outta here now!

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:59.741
- Please, Danny! You're my friend!
- Come on!

01:25:03.373 --> 01:25:03.873
Argh!

01:25:21.851 --> 01:25:24.686
Argh!

01:25:28.274 --> 01:25:30.432
Keep going! Keep going!

01:25:49.337 --> 01:25:51.248
Ugh!

01:25:58.097 --> 01:26:01.466
No! Come on! Come on!

01:26:43.478 --> 01:26:47.558
So, um... did you really
mean what you said?

01:26:48.984 --> 01:26:51.984
I would've said anything
to get me out of that mess.

01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:54.276
We'll talk about it. In New York.

01:27:00.121 --> 01:27:02.030
Let's go, Danny.

01:27:22.978 --> 01:27:24.970
So what do we do about the children?

01:27:26.064 --> 01:27:30.276
Tell their story. Let the healing begin.

01:27:30.361 --> 01:27:32.899
It's not too late for that, is it?

01:27:34.532 --> 01:27:36.358
No.

01:27:38.369 --> 01:27:44.158
Maybe that incompetent editor
over at Newsweek will reconsider.

01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:48.663
I mean, it's not everybody who'll go
through all this just for a story.

01:27:51.508 --> 01:27:53.334
You're all right, Dad.

01:28:09.109 --> 01:28:12.525
This signifies
that the spirit will part the corn

01:28:12.613 --> 01:28:15.780
and let through one
who finds truth within itself.
