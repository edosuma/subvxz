12:20.532 --> 12:23.649
Well, even though
my time and expertise
are extremely valuable,

12:23.744 --> 12:27.908
I accept your decision
to test my abilities.

12:27.998 --> 12:31.161
- Obviously, I passed,
with a lot of color.
- Pardon me?

12:31.251 --> 12:32.957
It means I did very well.

12:33.045 --> 12:35.331
Oh, right.
You, um— Flying colors.

12:35.464 --> 12:39.002
You— You passed
with flying colors.
Yes. I know.

12:39.092 --> 12:43.426
But passing your test
suggests you have something
more important in mind.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.014
I want to catch the bastard
who killed her.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.965
How do you know he
was a bastard? How do you
even know it was a man?

12:48.060 --> 12:50.051
Well— Uh, okay.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.262
I guess you know
who that is, right?

12:53.398 --> 12:55.650
No.
Judge Myles Hasty.

12:55.734 --> 12:57.645
That’s a federal judge.

12:57.736 --> 13:00.853
Well, I don’t follow
current events past
the Industrial Revolution.

13:00.989 --> 13:04.322
He killed Gemma.
Well, why haven’t you
arrested him?

13:04.451 --> 13:07.033
I don’t have enough proof.
Then how do you know
it’s him?

13:07.120 --> 13:10.658
| just know.
And I’d like to ask you
to help me catch him.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.165
I won’t do that.
[ Chuckles ]
Why?

13:14.252 --> 13:15.833
I will help you
find out the truth,

13:15.921 --> 13:18.537
and if the truth is
that he killed her,
I will help you catch him.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.543
But first the truth,
then the catching.

13:20.634 --> 13:24.502
Okay, look, all I need
is the kind of crap
that persuades a jury.

13:24.596 --> 13:28.180
But it seems to me
that someone like you
could benefit hugely...

13:28.266 --> 13:30.473
from an association
with someone like me.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.472
Oh. All right.
[ Laughing]

13:33.563 --> 13:35.770
Oh. You were being serious.
You’re serious?

13:35.857 --> 13:39.850
I was just kidding.
You know, I was having some fun.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.020
It is fun.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.702
This all happened a year
before the Cleo Eller case?

13:50.789 --> 13:52.700
Mm-hmm.
Almost to the day.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.827
Well, 13 months
less a week.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.954
And, uh, you didn’t argue...

13:57.045 --> 13:59.536
even though
he withheld information
and tested you?

13:59.631 --> 14:02.008
Well, my abilities
were outside
his experience.

14:02.092 --> 14:06.051
He called evidence “crap,”
and she basically
called you stupid.

14:06.138 --> 14:08.971
We were feeling
each other up, like
a honeymoon period.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.264
“Out.” We were
feeling each other out.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.559
Would you like to hear
the rest of the story?

14:17.149 --> 14:19.140
[Brennan Narrat/ng ]
Well, lon/y knew
Hodgins slight/y. ..

14:19.234 --> 14:23.318
as a very unpleasant authority
on ancient spores and insects,

14:23.405 --> 14:27.364
but he was the one who figured
out that the remains were
in a landfill for a year...

14:27.451 --> 14:29.817
before being discovered,
and that wasn ’t all.

14:29.911 --> 14:32.948
I found a silver
on the dead girl’s clothing.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.826
The term is nebulous.

14:34.916 --> 14:38.329
Wood.
I found a splinter of wood—

14:38.420 --> 14:40.376
maple, to be exact.

14:40.464 --> 14:44.707
So, your murder victim—
most l/ke/y struck with
something made out of maple.

14:44.801 --> 14:48.293
Still an observation so vague
as to approach meaninglessness.

14:48.430 --> 14:51.172
Is he trying to piss me off?
You are always angry.

14:51.308 --> 14:55.267
I’ve been told you have
an anger management problem.
I’m... in a program.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.730
I’m supposed to snap this
every time I get angry.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.305
I’d be happy to do that for you.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.812
The victim’s boyfriend was in town
the day she disappeared...

15:02.903 --> 15:05.269
trying out for a minor league
baseball team.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.272
Okay. So?
What are baseball bats
made of?

15:08.366 --> 15:12.075
Maple. Maple!
I should’ve thought of that!

15:12.162 --> 15:15.325
You know, I’m not so sure
that a baseball bat attack would
leave behind splinters though.

15:15.457 --> 15:19.075
Then why posit it
as a weapon?
Doubts!

15:19.169 --> 15:22.161
I have doubts, you see?
I am doubtful.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.042
Perhaps the two of you
could design an experiment.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.715
What? Whoa! No. Wait.

15:27.803 --> 15:30.010
- Work together?
-Mmm.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.634
Yes.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.939
I brought in Gemma’s
baseball-playing boyfriend
for questioning for murder,

15:43.026 --> 15:44.891
but I know he didn’t do it.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.485
How do you know?
VVeH,because
the killer’s Judge Hasty.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.483
Well, feeling
isn’t knowing.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.735
When you know something,
you can argue fact,

15:51.827 --> 15:53.909
not merely make
insupportable claims
in a passionate tone.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.202
You said that
in a passionate tone, without facts.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.951
You see, when it comes down to it,
it’s all about what you feel.

15:59.042 --> 16:02.409
W-Why are you interrogating
the boyfriend if you’re
already convinced?

16:02.504 --> 16:04.870
Ah, because
I wanna convince you.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.456
That’s very kind.

16:07.551 --> 16:09.917
Can I come in
and watch you
broil the suspect?

16:10.011 --> 16:12.923
Yeah, you know, I could “broil,”
but I think you mean “grill.”

16:15.517 --> 16:19.055
I fell apart after I heard
that Gemma got killed.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.683
Couldn’t concentrate
on anything, you know.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.638
Couldn’t hold it together.

16:23.733 --> 16:27.146
Some people might say the result
of a guilty conscience.

16:27.237 --> 16:31.776
I was in DC. to try out
for a minor league
baseball team.

16:31.867 --> 16:35.701
My dad was with me,
three of my uncles
and four cousms.

16:35.787 --> 16:39.871
I wasn’t away from anybody
long enough to kill Gemma...

16:39.958 --> 16:42.290
and transport her body
to New York City.

16:42.377 --> 16:43.742
He has alibis?

16:43.837 --> 16:46.795
Tell Dr. Brennan how you did
at your tryouts.

16:46.882 --> 16:50.090
I did great.
What-What does that
have to do with anything?

16:50.177 --> 16:52.338
Well, your tryouts were
after Gemma was killed.

16:52.429 --> 16:55.136
Yeah, but I didn’t
know that yet.

16:55.223 --> 16:57.259
I thought— I thought
everything was great.

17:03.607 --> 17:06.098
I still dream about being there
when that happened,

17:07.903 --> 17:09.814
about protecting her.

17:09.905 --> 17:12.487
Psychologically consistent.

17:13.783 --> 17:15.774
I’m not well acquainted
with psychology,

17:15.869 --> 17:17.860
but anthropologically speaking,

17:17.954 --> 17:20.070
men are programmed
to consider themselves...

17:20.165 --> 17:22.076
the protectors of their mates.

17:22.167 --> 17:25.955
it was unnecessary
to put you through this again.

17:26.046 --> 17:29.083
I don’t mind coming in,
answering these questions,

17:29.174 --> 17:31.836
’cause it means that you guys
are still lookin’,

17:32.928 --> 17:34.839
and I want that.

17:45.023 --> 17:48.857
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Why are you the deliverer
of the blow while I am the recipient?

17:48.944 --> 17:51.606
Because you grunted
when you picked up the bat.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.561
Brace yourself.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.313
[ Grunts ]
[Man]
Whoa!

17:55.450 --> 17:58.237
Excuse me.
Go back to work, please.
[Zack Groans ]

17:58.370 --> 18:00.986
Conclusions thus far?
No, nothin’.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.787
The bat did not
leave behind any slivers,

18:02.874 --> 18:05.365
even though
the suit Zack is wearing
is much more abrasive...

18:05.460 --> 18:07.416
than the cotton
the victim was wearing.

18:07.504 --> 18:10.496
A blow like that
would’ve left behind
unmistakable bone damage.

18:10.590 --> 18:14.082
Have you tried striking Zack
in the soft tissue
or in the liver?

18:14.177 --> 18:16.714
- What?
- Yeah, anatomy’s
really not my thing.

18:16.805 --> 18:19.046
- Ow!
- Whoa-ho-ho!

18:19.140 --> 18:21.096
That one had some pepper!

18:21.184 --> 18:24.051
That would most certainly
have caused hemorrhaging
in the liver,

18:24.145 --> 18:26.056
followed by death.

18:26.147 --> 18:29.605
Nothin’. A bat is so honed
and close-grained,

18:29.693 --> 18:32.355
it cannot be broken
on the soft tissues
of a human being.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.027
- We can try striking his head.
- What?

18:35.156 --> 18:37.067
Unnecessary.
[ Sighs ]

18:37.158 --> 18:39.945
So I guess that a baseball bat
was not the murder weapon.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.699
Dr. Brennan, I found something
interesting in the victim’s X-rays.

18:45.709 --> 18:48.701
[Brennan ]
The bones of the inner ear
are missing here.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.127
Indicating that they may have
been extracted during the assault.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.956
- Did you set up
the UV. light source?
- Yes.

18:54.092 --> 18:57.004
No, I’ll do it, Zack.
Thank you, Dr. Brennan.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.051
It’s hard to move
in this suit.

19:02.392 --> 19:05.099
These bone bruisings
occurred before death.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.598
- Possibilities?
- Recurring pattern.

19:07.689 --> 19:10.396
So, either struck repeatedly
with the same narrow weapon...

19:10.483 --> 19:13.316
or perhaps crushed
beneath some kind of grid.

19:13.403 --> 19:16.361
Could you please measure
the exact distances
between the bruises?

19:16.448 --> 19:18.905
Of course, Dr. Brennan.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.734
[Grunts]

19:24.414 --> 19:27.201
So at 6:30 pm,
Gemma and her choir sang here...

19:27.292 --> 19:29.999
for a group of hoity-toits.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.042
I don’t know
what that means.

19:32.130 --> 19:36.294
Shakers and machers and,
you know, influential types,
including Judge Hasty.

19:36.384 --> 19:38.420
There was a reception here
at 9:00 pm.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.924
Gemma was seen here at
the beginning of the reception,
and then— poof.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.882
A year later,
her remains were found
in a New York City landfill.

19:44.976 --> 19:47.388
So, what are we lookin’ for?

19:47.479 --> 19:52.189
The source of a pattern
of bone bruising that happened
very shortly before she died.

19:52.275 --> 19:55.517
Regular strikes,
approximately
33 centimeters apart,

19:55.612 --> 19:58.149
spanning the remains
from forehead down
to mid-femur.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.730
l was thinking,
something made of maple—

20:00.825 --> 20:03.908
a heavy bookcase,
scaffolding, a ladder.

20:03.995 --> 20:06.828
I gotta tell ya,
I really am enjoying
working with you, Bones.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.538
Bones is not my name.
Well, it’s just a nickname.

20:09.626 --> 20:12.208
Wow! Yes. | see.
I could call you “Shoes.”

20:12.337 --> 20:15.545
Shoes? Why Shoes?
Yes, because they are
so very shiny.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.623
The shoes, they’re
a part of my uniform.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.094
The F.B.l., theyjust have
a way of doing things.

20:20.178 --> 20:22.920
Well, anthropologically speaking,
para-militaristic organizations...

20:23.014 --> 20:25.881
tend to constrain individuality.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.886
That’s for sure.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.013
But in any group,
no matter how restrictive,

20:30.105 --> 20:33.393
the freethinkers,
the mavericks, the rebels...

20:33.483 --> 20:35.474
with leadership quality...

20:35.568 --> 20:39.106
find ways to declare
their distinctiveness.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.859
You know,
I’m a freethinking rogue rebel.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.820
Are you seeing anyone?

20:44.911 --> 20:47.573
Wow. Right to the point
there, huh, Bones?

20:47.664 --> 20:51.282
Um, casually,
but she doesn’t
really like my hours.

20:51.418 --> 20:54.285
You?
Well, uh, a physicist
has been asking me out,

20:54.379 --> 20:56.370
so I was thinking
of saying yes.

20:56.464 --> 21:00.048
- I’d ask you out if I could.
- Why can’t you?

21:00.135 --> 21:03.252
Well, F.B.l. rules again.

21:03.346 --> 21:06.588
No fraternizing
with other agents or consultants.

21:06.724 --> 21:09.716
That’s too bad.
Glad you think so.

21:11.146 --> 21:14.309
These stairs—
Iook, they’re made out of maple.

21:14.399 --> 21:18.642
The sliver in the victim’s clothing
could’ve come from
violent contact with stairs.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.237
What about
the bone bruising?

21:20.321 --> 21:23.939
The hypotenuse
of the triangle formed
by the riser and tread...

21:24.033 --> 21:26.490
looks to be apprOX/mate/y
33 centimeters.

21:26.578 --> 21:29.945
Gemma was probably
trying to escape,
fell down here,

21:30.039 --> 21:31.904
and the judge...

21:32.000 --> 21:34.992
probably dragged her
to the exit right over here.

21:35.086 --> 21:36.701
There it is!

21:36.796 --> 21:41.210
The killer could ’ve driven back here
and taken her away without being seen.

21:45.054 --> 21:48.763
You th/nk that Gemma Arrington
was chased by Judge Hasty?

21:48.850 --> 21:52.468
- He played football in college.
- Then he swung her into
a wall or something?

21:52.562 --> 21:54.974
Well, no, no, no.
The next part here shows—

21:55.064 --> 21:59.774
- Who’s this now?
- Oh, I’m Angela Montenegro.
I’m an artist. Who are you?

21:59.861 --> 22:03.103
That’s Miss Julian.
She ’s a federal prosecutor.
She is on our side.

22:03.198 --> 22:06.861
Tell her that Angela
possesses extremely keen
spatial awareness.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.987
- And who’s this now?
- That’s a squint.

22:09.078 --> 22:12.036
I’m Dr. Temperance Brennan
from the Jeffersonian.

22:12.123 --> 22:14.705
Uh, don’t bother.
You know, never
remember squints.

22:14.792 --> 22:16.953
- That’s correct.
And you know why?
- Why?

22:17.045 --> 22:21.163
Because they get all
wishy—washy and flip-floppy
on the witness stand.

22:21.257 --> 22:25.626
So it’s better I don’t remember
the last time they let me down
when I meet ’em again.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.132
- Here. Here. Continue
with the flip book there.
- Okay. Yes. Okay.

22:28.264 --> 22:31.176
This is great.
Okay. So the judge
tackles Gemma.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.383
Uh, you remember, you know,
football in college.

22:33.478 --> 22:35.719
And grabs her ankle.

22:35.855 --> 22:40.599
Wham! Right there. Bam!
He’s got an unconscious girl on
his hands, and he thinks she’s dead.

22:40.693 --> 22:44.652
Loads her into his car
at the bottom of the stairs,
drives her to a landfill in New York.

22:44.739 --> 22:47.071
- Why was he chasing her?
- Who cares why?

22:47.158 --> 22:51.993
Oh, let’s see!
Ajudge, a jury, the press
and, oh, yeah, me!

22:52.080 --> 22:55.163
Caroline,
all / need is a warrant
to arrest Judge Hasty.

22:55.250 --> 22:58.663
Well, maybe if this little
stick-figure thing...

22:58.753 --> 23:02.041
was a big computer,
lots of bells and whistles.

23:02.131 --> 23:05.214
But right now, it just looks
like a sadistic children’s book.

23:05.301 --> 23:08.919
What’s the “pincer death grip” thing
that actually killed the girl?

23:09.013 --> 23:12.426
- We don’t know yet.
- This won’t get me a warrant.

23:12.517 --> 23:17.261

if I refused, the headline

“Federal judge declines
to cooperate in homicide
investigation.”

that you chased Gemma Arrington,
and she fell down those stairs.

Okay, Bones.
Way to jump right in there.
She was trying to escape you.

24:10.908 --> 24:14.492
- Why? I’m a very nice man.
- Did you use that line on her too?

24:14.579 --> 24:17.946
The only words
I ever spoke to the girl were,
“You have a lovely voice,”

24:18.041 --> 24:20.407
and I said it in front
of about a hundred people.

- Okay.

Booth is suggesting
sexual impropriety.

So I chased her

That’s very melodramatic.
And then what?

24:31.220 --> 24:33.211

No. She was trying to get away
from you, and you tripped her,

was somewhere between

250 pounds of force.

that the girl’s head
was slammed.

crushed the entire side
of her head, Ange.
