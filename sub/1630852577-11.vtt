00:01.068 --> 00:03.470
RuPaul: Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

00:03.470 --> 00:06.206
It's kind of insane
to hear RuPaul say

00:06.206 --> 00:09.109
how freaking good we all are.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.044
There's gonna be one challenge
we're all gonna bomb.

00:11.044 --> 00:12.613
Yeah, we all go home.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.381
[all laugh]

00:14.381 --> 00:16.350
We're playing
the Snatch Game.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.118
[cheering]

00:18.118 --> 00:20.320
I said he'll shake
your maracas.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.123
Her pudenda is awful, Ru.

00:23.123 --> 00:25.292
Okay.

00:25.292 --> 00:26.727
It's quiet on set.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.529
I also said children.

00:29.529 --> 00:33.233
Our jokes
aren't really landing.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.569
DeJa Skye.

00:35.569 --> 00:36.703
Yay-ya!

00:36.703 --> 00:39.006
I thought it was actually
the good one.

00:39.006 --> 00:40.574
Con-drag-ulations.

00:40.574 --> 00:43.443
You're the winner
of this week's challenge.

00:45.145 --> 00:46.413
I'm sorry, my dears,

00:46.413 --> 00:48.548
but the rest of you

00:48.548 --> 00:51.051
are all up for elimination.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.889
What the hell?

00:55.889 --> 00:58.125
To make my final decision,

00:58.125 --> 01:00.027
you are cordially invited

01:00.027 --> 01:05.766
to a Lip Sync
Lalaparuza Smackdown

01:05.766 --> 01:08.135
to determine
which one of you...

01:09.937 --> 01:11.872
will sashay away.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.347
Oh.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.616
What the fuck
is going on?

01:22.616 --> 01:25.152
What the literal
fuck is going on?

01:25.152 --> 01:27.821
This is the biggest gag.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.823
Not only did we
screw up Snatch Game,

01:29.823 --> 01:33.427
but now we all have to
lip sync for our lives

01:33.427 --> 01:36.396
to save our places
in this competition.

01:36.396 --> 01:38.899
Whoo, girl.
That was a lot.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.902
We're all kind of just
in disbelief right now.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.671
It just--it's--
it doesn't make sense to me.

01:44.671 --> 01:47.474
We are all suffering
the nuclear fallout

01:47.474 --> 01:50.510
that was Snatch Game
Season 14.

01:50.510 --> 01:51.511
Ugh.

01:51.511 --> 01:53.013
I'm embarrassed.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.581
Jesus Christ,

01:54.581 --> 01:58.051
we're terrible
at doing the Snatch Game.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.087
I don't know what the fuck
is going on right now.

02:00.087 --> 02:02.155
Does anybody else
have an idea what's going on?

02:02.155 --> 02:05.559
Y'all about to lip sync.

02:05.559 --> 02:09.396
So, like, how are they gonna
do it, because it's seven.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.764
Is it gonna be two, two,
and three?

02:10.764 --> 02:11.765
Well, DeJa doesn't have to,
remember?

02:11.765 --> 02:12.766
Well, no, it's seven
without her.

02:12.766 --> 02:13.934
Oh.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.502
We do not know

02:15.502 --> 02:17.270
how the whole thing's
gonna be played out.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.506
It could be 2V2V3.

02:19.506 --> 02:20.907
It can be all together.

02:20.907 --> 02:22.909
And it makes me think, like,
is one person gonna go home?

02:22.909 --> 02:24.011
Probably not.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.012
It's probably gonna be,
like, two people.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.279
-Two.
-I reckon.

02:26.279 --> 02:28.081
Or maybe seven.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.052
We have to find humor in it,

02:32.052 --> 02:33.754
because no one else found humor
in Snatch Game, okay?

02:33.754 --> 02:35.155
[laughs]

02:35.155 --> 02:37.891
I'm annoyed as hell,
and it's irri--ugh.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.226
It's just fucking
annoying at this point.

02:39.226 --> 02:42.696
I did what I would consider

02:42.696 --> 02:43.964
to be safe in the Snatch Game.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.133
Why am I in the bottom
and the two people

02:46.133 --> 02:49.236
that have consistently
done pretty poor

02:49.236 --> 02:51.438
in the past few challenges

02:51.438 --> 02:54.107
are getting not only
another chance,

02:54.107 --> 02:56.710
but a chance at something
they're both really good at?

02:56.710 --> 02:58.979
No offense, Jasmine,
no offense, Jorgeous,

02:58.979 --> 03:02.349
but you've been
in the bottom a lot.

03:05.685 --> 03:06.853
And I'm just, like, annoyed.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.589
And no hard feelings
towards y'all at all.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.758
I'm, like, getting
really overwhelmed,

03:11.758 --> 03:15.195
and it's starting to really
piss me the fuck off.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.631
Oh, my God, girl.

03:17.631 --> 03:21.268
Do not put "no offense"
in front of something

03:21.268 --> 03:22.702
when you're gonna say
something rude.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.371
That means that you mean it.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.374
I know I look
fucking bitchy as hell,

03:27.374 --> 03:28.675
but I feel like
I have a valid reason

03:28.675 --> 03:30.544
as to why to feel this way.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.878
Yes, you do,
but just so you know,

03:31.878 --> 03:33.847
someone is going home,
so you don't have to be mad yet.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.482
Am I the only person
that feels this way?

03:35.482 --> 03:37.517
I mean, seriously,
let's be honest.

03:37.517 --> 03:42.422
I know for a fact by the looks
on some of these girls' faces--

03:42.422 --> 03:45.959
Bosco--that you're just
as unhappy as I am with it.

03:45.959 --> 03:51.131
You have to be ready
for any fucking thing. Period.

03:51.131 --> 03:55.602
Daya is so mad
that I am still here,

03:55.602 --> 03:56.736
and let her be.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.205
Because now she's worried

03:58.205 --> 04:00.140
that she may have
to lip sync against me

04:00.140 --> 04:03.376
for her stake in this place,
and that's fine.

04:03.376 --> 04:05.479
Because if we are
lip syncing against each other,

04:05.479 --> 04:07.380
girl, you're going home,
not even a question.

04:07.380 --> 04:10.550
On a scale of 10 to 10,
how mad do you think Daya is?

04:10.550 --> 04:13.053
Oh, a 15.

04:13.053 --> 04:18.291
These seven girls have
to lip sync for their life,

04:18.291 --> 04:20.127
and one is gonna go home.
[laughs]

04:20.127 --> 04:21.394
Ugh!

04:21.394 --> 04:22.562
I'm ready for a show,

04:22.562 --> 04:23.897
because this is gonna be
a fight to the finish.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.335
If we kill her, we don't
have to lip sync tomorrow.

to really just light a fire

05:06.973 --> 05:10.243

of lip sync smackdown.

-Bitch, I feel amazing.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.759
I'm sorry y'all gotta stress
today, but I feel good.

05:25.759 --> 05:26.793
[laughs]

05:26.793 --> 05:28.495
Bask in it, bitch, bask in it.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.464
Bask in it, because
it's not happening again.

05:31.464 --> 05:35.802
All these bitches are shitting
in their pants, and I'm not.

05:35.802 --> 05:39.739
[laughs]

05:39.739 --> 05:41.007
I'm excited for today.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.509
This feels a little bit

05:42.509 --> 05:45.478
like you can kind of
just let it all go and perform.

05:45.478 --> 05:47.447
-Yeah.
-I think a lot of people

05:47.447 --> 05:49.082
were trying to play it safe
in Snatch Game,

05:49.082 --> 05:51.851
and I think that Ru wants
to see us fight for our spots

05:51.851 --> 05:53.353
and not play it safe.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.523
The sort of embarrassment
on Snatch Game not going well

05:56.523 --> 05:58.692
is, like,
fuel for me right now.

06:01.061 --> 06:04.931
What is your main, like,
type of song to perform?

06:04.931 --> 06:08.068
I like to make my own mixes
and make, like, a story.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.837
-Okay.
-Or, like, something theatrical.

06:10.837 --> 06:12.906
So sometimes
I get a little spooked

06:12.906 --> 06:15.742
if it's just a regular song
by itself.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.210
I'm hoping that I can get a song

06:17.210 --> 06:22.349
that I can feel
and play up a shtick to.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.917
I just don't want any song

06:23.917 --> 06:27.187
that is just, like,
unz-unz-unz-unz club music.

06:27.187 --> 06:30.924
I'm definitely more
of a ballad girl,

06:30.924 --> 06:34.861
more of a gown on the show
kind of girl.

06:34.861 --> 06:36.329
Oh, yeah, Park & Bark.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.631
The "Park & Bark,"

06:37.631 --> 06:39.899
where you just park it
right there in that one spot

06:39.899 --> 06:42.569
and you just give it
all you got.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.537
You know, I feel like
as entertainers, honey,

06:44.537 --> 06:46.606
you have to be, like,
well-rounded,

06:46.606 --> 06:47.707
like, of what you could do,

06:47.707 --> 06:49.476
but we still have
our favorites, girl.

06:49.476 --> 06:51.044
This is the moment

06:51.044 --> 06:53.780
where everybody
is sizing each other up.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.216
Everybody
has different strengths

06:56.216 --> 06:57.450
when it comes to lip syncing,

06:57.450 --> 07:00.920
but I am doing whatever
I need to do to stay here,

07:00.920 --> 07:04.257
whether it's dance,
ballad the house down bad boots,

07:04.257 --> 07:06.126
it does not matter, I'm ready.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.630
Bosco, I could tell in your face
just a little bit

07:10.630 --> 07:13.767
that you weren't too happy,
but you didn't say anything.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.268
I was not pleased.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.972
You were definitely voicing
a lot of everyone's feelings.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.940
But also, I was mainly
displeased with myself.

07:20.940 --> 07:24.577
I'm irritated at myself that
I put myself in this position.

07:24.577 --> 07:28.848
I took it personally for me
to fail during Snatch Game.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.383
I'm embarrassed
with my performance,

07:30.383 --> 07:32.986
very much internalized,
like, my own failure.

07:32.986 --> 07:36.656
I am just in such a place
of, like, intense focus,

07:36.656 --> 07:39.025
like, I get to show the judges,
like, what I do.

07:39.025 --> 07:41.227
But, like, believe me
when I tell you

07:41.227 --> 07:44.564
-I am not going home tonight.
-Right.

07:44.564 --> 07:48.468
The idea of coming in
for the lip sync not prepared

07:48.468 --> 07:51.271
fills me with
such a level of dread.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.939
Everyone in this room

07:52.939 --> 07:57.010
excels at a different genre
of performance.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.645
I don't wanna go
against Jorgeous

07:58.645 --> 08:00.280
in any sort of dance number,

08:00.280 --> 08:04.451
and I don't wanna go against
Willow in anything super campy.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.786
Like, right now,
just, like, my entire being

08:06.786 --> 08:08.521
is just dedicated to, like,

08:08.521 --> 08:11.591
you are going to put on
a motherfucking show.

08:11.591 --> 08:14.027
Yeah.

08:14.027 --> 08:18.098
I feel like Bosco is one of the
most nervous for this lip sync,

08:18.098 --> 08:21.267
because I know that
she can get in her head a lot,

08:21.267 --> 08:25.271
and she kind of goes
down a hole sometimes.

08:25.271 --> 08:29.109
It's like you can see
the cracks starting to come.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.211
It's going to be a lip sync,

08:31.211 --> 08:34.013
and we all do it
on a daily basis.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.281
Like, there should be no nerves.

08:35.281 --> 08:36.950
You guys are gonna turn it
the fuck out.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.486
I will say the only thing
I'm nervous about

08:39.486 --> 08:42.622
is I'm not a dancer
like Jorgeous or Jasmine is.

08:42.622 --> 08:44.190
Like, that is something
I think about,

08:44.190 --> 08:46.860
and if I'm being honest, that
is something that's in my head,

08:46.860 --> 08:49.529
because I'm not
a crazy-ass dancer like that.

08:49.529 --> 08:53.633
So I'm gonna do what I can do,
of course, and try my best.

08:53.633 --> 08:54.968
[chuckles]

08:54.968 --> 08:58.338
I feel confident
in my lip sync skills.

08:58.338 --> 09:02.308
However, I for sure do not
wanna go against Jorgeous,

09:02.308 --> 09:04.344
and I honestly don't wanna
go against Jasmine.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.846
[laughs]

09:08.581 --> 09:10.917
So how do you guys think that
it's actually gonna go down?

09:10.917 --> 09:12.318
Like, do you think

09:12.318 --> 09:14.521
you're gonna be lip syncing
against each other or solo?

09:14.521 --> 09:15.688
Oh, my God.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.757
I didn't even think about solo.

09:17.757 --> 09:19.092
Bitch, if it was that?

09:19.092 --> 09:21.261
Or another person?

09:21.261 --> 09:23.396
Bitch, what if they
brought back the other girls?

09:23.396 --> 09:24.964
[gasps]

09:24.964 --> 09:26.566
Stop, DeJa!

09:26.566 --> 09:28.401
-Shut up!
-Oh, my God!

09:28.401 --> 09:29.569
I didn't even think of that.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.204
I am muting DeJa.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.572
[laughs]

09:32.572 --> 09:33.606
I'm muting.

09:33.606 --> 09:36.476
I do have a question
for you, though.

09:36.476 --> 09:39.179
Why do you say "no offense" when
you're just saying your opinion?

09:41.147 --> 09:43.650
No offense, Jasmine,
no offense, Jorgeous,

09:43.650 --> 09:45.552
but you've been
in the bottom a lot.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.987
Because I don't want you guys
to think it's me

09:47.987 --> 09:50.089
being, like, cunty
or rude or anything.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.458
I just want you to know

09:51.458 --> 09:54.727
that this is how I'm feeling
in this particular moment.

09:54.727 --> 09:57.096
Basically, by her saying
"no offense,"

09:57.096 --> 09:59.332
it's for her to not get
a rebuttal back.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.501
It's for her to just say,
"This is my statement.

10:01.501 --> 10:05.071
I don't want you to respond,
and this is just my opinion."

10:05.071 --> 10:06.773
Go shoo-fly
with that shit, okay?

10:06.773 --> 10:09.409
Instead saying no offense,
which is kind of just a buffer,

10:09.409 --> 10:10.844
why don't you
just say it out loud?

10:10.844 --> 10:12.345
I didn't know I was talking
to a counselor right now.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.880
-Oh!
-Oh!

10:13.880 --> 10:15.682
Well, no, it's just a question.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.817
Well, I told you my answer.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.185
I only say that

10:19.185 --> 10:21.087
because I don't want you
thinking that it's personal.

10:21.087 --> 10:22.489
But it's a little personal,

10:22.489 --> 10:24.457
because you have come for me
and Jorgeous before in the past,

10:24.457 --> 10:26.759
and then you group us
again last time

10:26.759 --> 10:27.760
for kind of the same reasons.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.761
Because you guys
got harsh critiques,

10:28.761 --> 10:30.029
which we all got bad critiques,

10:30.029 --> 10:31.998
but you guys did get
really harsh critiques.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.666
That's why.

10:33.666 --> 10:36.035
No offense.

10:36.035 --> 10:38.071
Jasmine's trying
to get into my head

10:38.071 --> 10:40.373
because she knows that
I'm stressed the fuck out

10:40.373 --> 10:43.610
about this
lip sync extravaganza.

10:43.610 --> 10:44.911
In the future,

10:44.911 --> 10:48.081
if I do say something
that rubs you the wrong way,

10:48.081 --> 10:51.484
I'm more than happy to have a
conversation about it one on one

10:51.484 --> 10:53.686
rather than you,
like, coming for me

10:53.686 --> 10:57.357
while we're trying to focus
on the assignment at hand.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.925
So essentially
what you're saying

10:58.925 --> 11:00.260
is you guys love each other.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.028
-[laughs]
-I do.

11:02.028 --> 11:03.263
She's like the younger sister

11:03.263 --> 11:04.697
that I wanna throw
into the ground.

11:04.697 --> 11:05.832
[chuckles]

11:08.535 --> 11:10.303
Who's ready
and who's not ready for this?

11:10.303 --> 11:12.438
I've got a nice combination
of excitement

11:12.438 --> 11:13.673
and shitting my pants, you know?

11:13.673 --> 11:16.242
Yeah, it is hard,
but it is what it is, honey.

11:16.242 --> 11:18.011
You better put
the big girl pants on, girl,

11:18.011 --> 11:19.979
and just go do
what you gotta do.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.948
WWE smackdown style.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.516
Y'all was ready to do so.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.918
Oh, bitch, I'm always ready
to lip sync.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.320
Oh, oh, she always ready.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.156
As long as we don't have
to fucking act or anything.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.358
These challenges
just be wearing my ass out,

11:32.358 --> 11:33.660
but the fact that it's now

11:33.660 --> 11:36.462
we are doing a lip sync battle
against each other,

11:36.462 --> 11:40.767
the dynamic has changed
immensely, bitch.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.268
I'm known as the person

11:42.268 --> 11:44.571
that nobody wants
to lip sync against,

11:44.571 --> 11:47.173
and honestly,
it feels kind of good.

11:47.173 --> 11:49.008
These bitches
better be scared of me.

11:49.008 --> 11:52.045
Jorgeous, can you promise me
that you do your signature move?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.446
-Punching the ghost?
-Yes!

11:53.446 --> 11:54.881
Punching the ghost.
[laughs]

11:54.881 --> 11:56.749
Punching the ghost.

11:56.749 --> 11:58.918
Of course!

11:58.918 --> 12:01.354
Ah! Ah-ha!

12:01.354 --> 12:04.057
-[laughs]
-Y'all are bitches.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.793
Let's just get the elephant
out of the room.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.595
If I was in these queens' shoes,

12:08.595 --> 12:10.530
I would not wanna
go up against Jorgeous.

12:10.530 --> 12:13.266
She is an amazing lip syncer,

12:13.266 --> 12:15.568
and I would be scared
if I was any of them.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.504
I'm just ready for a show.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.940
Gimme some popcorn,
because I'm ready.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.809
No offense.

Welcome to the main stage

12:51.938 --> 12:56.275
for an extra special episode
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

12:56.275 --> 13:00.713
Last week, seven of our queens
tied for last place.

13:00.713 --> 13:05.251
This week, the challenge is on
to redeem themselves

13:05.251 --> 13:10.256
in a Lip Sync
Lalaparuza Smackdown.

13:10.256 --> 13:14.527
Racers, start your engines,

13:23.803 --> 13:26.973

Girl, all these bitches
are ready to lip sync.

13:32.578 --> 13:34.647

13:34.647 --> 13:37.550
to just get this show
on the road now.

13:39.018 --> 13:40.586
Welcome, ladies.

13:42.922 --> 13:47.894
Last week, your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent

13:47.894 --> 13:49.929
failed the test.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.867
So tonight we're throwing

13:54.867 --> 13:58.705
a Lip Sync
Lalaparuza Smackdown.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.875
A series of six lip syncs.

14:02.875 --> 14:07.280
If you win your lip sync, you
will be safe from elimination.

14:07.280 --> 14:11.517
If you lose,
you'll continue to face off

14:11.517 --> 14:13.152
until two queens remain.

14:14.420 --> 14:19.225
In the end, one of you
will sashay away...

14:32.138 --> 14:35.074
you're safe
from elimination tonight.

Thank you.
Good luck, ladies.

-Love you.
-Thank you, sis.

14:41.614 --> 14:44.584
While these bitches
have to sweat it out onstage

14:44.584 --> 14:46.486

motherfucking life,

14:46.486 --> 14:50.523

Now, to determine
the first queen to lip sync,

choose one ball.

do you choose?

16:52.578 --> 16:54.914
I'm gonna pick my big sister
Daya Betty.

Ooh, dang!

That is shady.

I'm gonna take
a sip of this, bitch.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.993
Not super pleased that I'm
having to go against Jasmine,

17:06.993 --> 17:09.862

can buck and dance and flip.

Ladies, I've made my decision.

21:46.372 --> 21:48.007
[gasps]

21:48.007 --> 21:49.508
Aah!

21:51.277 --> 21:53.913
Ladies, I've made my decision.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.952
Daya Betty.

21:59.952 --> 22:02.121
Shantay you stay.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.957
Aah! Thank you!

22:04.957 --> 22:05.991
Oh, my God.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.994
You are safe
to slay another day.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.363
You may leave the stage.

22:11.363 --> 22:12.364
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

22:12.364 --> 22:13.699
Get it, girl.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.634
-I love you.
-Love you.

22:15.634 --> 22:18.504
Props to you, big sis.
You got me, gal.

22:18.504 --> 22:22.074
Whew, Miss Thing!

22:22.074 --> 22:23.642
Bitch, Jasmine thought

22:23.642 --> 22:25.711
she was being slick, girl,
choosing Daya.

22:25.711 --> 22:28.447
Daya said, no, ma'am, no Pam,
no ham, no turkey, bitch.

22:28.447 --> 22:29.548
Not on this day.

22:29.548 --> 22:33.285
Jasmine Kennedie,
I'm sorry, my dear,

22:33.285 --> 22:36.722
but you are still up
for elimination.

22:36.722 --> 22:42.027
Please step to the back of
the stage to await your fate.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.862
Can't wait to see
who I'm up against next.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.331
Thank you.

22:45.331 --> 22:48.534
I did talk a big game, saying
I was going to send her home,

22:48.534 --> 22:50.803
and put my foot in my mouth.
Um...

22:50.803 --> 22:52.071
[laughs]

22:52.071 --> 22:55.040
But let her go, because
she wouldn't have been able

22:55.040 --> 22:56.208
to lip sync
any of those other songs.

22:59.445 --> 23:00.579
I have no idea
who the winner is.

23:00.579 --> 23:02.748
The TV goes blank,

23:02.748 --> 23:04.083
so I'm just waiting
in anticipation.

23:05.351 --> 23:07.186
[laughs]

23:07.186 --> 23:09.154
Aah!

23:09.154 --> 23:10.823
I fucking knew it!

23:10.823 --> 23:12.725
Oh, my God,
did you see what happened?

23:12.725 --> 23:13.726
Yes, bitch!

23:13.726 --> 23:14.727
I was so scared.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.830
I was so scared.
Oh, my God!

23:17.830 --> 23:23.302
I feel like a badass
because I just beat Jasmine.

23:23.302 --> 23:26.672
I feel like I have
just slayed a giant.

23:26.672 --> 23:28.340
I'm ready to drink.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.875
I'm really fucking proud
of myself.

23:29.875 --> 23:31.210
You should be, bitch.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.712
That was, like, scarier
than the fucking Snatch Game,

23:33.712 --> 23:34.980
to be honest, for me.

23:34.980 --> 23:36.548
How does it feel, bitch?
You were the first one safe.

23:36.548 --> 23:39.485
We get to watch the rest
of these bitches sweat it out.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.620
I know. I can drink
a little bit and just relax.

23:41.620 --> 23:42.688
-Uh-huh.
-It's gonna be so nice.

23:42.688 --> 23:44.256
-Yes.
-Ooh. Oh, okay.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.557
Let me get comfortable.

23:45.557 --> 23:49.395
Will the remaining five queens
please step forward.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.732
Is this, like, our Super Bowl?

23:53.732 --> 23:55.200
-I guess so, yeah.
-That's what it feels like.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.502
I feel like we're,
like, watching football.

23:56.502 --> 23:59.204
Let's see who's lip syncing

23:59.204 --> 24:02.107
in round two of our Smackdown.

24:03.409 --> 24:05.511
Calix, will you do us the honor?

24:16.355 --> 24:19.358
Show us whose ball
you are holding.

24:19.358 --> 24:20.726
Who is it, who is it,
who is it?

24:20.726 --> 24:24.463
WP. Willow Pill.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.698
Willow!

24:25.698 --> 24:26.965
Ooh!

24:26.965 --> 24:29.234
Willow, you'll be competing

24:29.234 --> 24:31.937
in tonight's second lip sync.

24:31.937 --> 24:35.240
Oh, shit.

24:36.375 --> 24:37.509
I didn't want this.

24:37.509 --> 24:38.644
I wanted someone to choose me,

24:38.644 --> 24:41.714
because I wanted to know
what song I'm doing.

24:41.714 --> 24:46.819
Willow, which queen
do you choose as your opponent?

24:46.819 --> 24:48.320
Willow's been playing her cards

24:48.320 --> 24:50.322
very close to her chest,
you know,

24:50.322 --> 24:52.324
kind of has a poker face 24/7,

24:52.324 --> 24:54.493
so I really don't know
who she's gonna pick.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.761
I'm picking the girl

24:55.761 --> 24:58.931
that I think is gonna pick
the song that I want.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.632
I choose Bosco.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.036
Yes!

25:04.036 --> 25:05.671
Oh, this is gonna be good.

25:05.671 --> 25:07.973
I think Bosco's
a little gooped.

25:07.973 --> 25:10.743
[exhales]

25:10.743 --> 25:12.344
I see you, Willow.
You better werk.

25:14.113 --> 25:18.350
Bosco, now it's your turn.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.853
What song do you choose?

25:20.853 --> 25:23.055
Never Too Much, Don't Let Go,

25:23.055 --> 25:26.825
Love Don't Cost a Thing,
or Radio?

25:30.095 --> 25:32.831
Let's do Never Too Much
by Luther Vandross.

25:32.831 --> 25:35.601
Hey!

25:35.601 --> 25:37.102
All right, now.

25:37.102 --> 25:40.572
We gonna get this party
motherfucking started!

25:40.572 --> 25:44.576
I am so happy.
[laughs]

25:45.644 --> 25:48.046
That is the only song
that I wanted.

25:48.046 --> 25:52.317
She played
right into my hands.

25:52.317 --> 25:56.422
The rest of you may step
to the back of the stage.

25:57.423 --> 25:58.757
Oh, my God.

25:58.757 --> 26:01.360
Where's the popcorn?
I need the popcorn.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.395
Two queens stand before me.

26:03.395 --> 26:07.266
Willow Pill, Bosco,

26:07.266 --> 26:09.368
this is your chance
to impress me

26:09.368 --> 26:13.005
and save yourself
from elimination.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.309
The time has come...
[thunder]

26:17.309 --> 26:19.745
for you to lip sync...

26:19.745 --> 26:22.648
[echoing] for your life!

26:25.350 --> 26:28.454
This is my first time lip
syncing in front of the judges.

26:28.454 --> 26:31.256
The Luther song
is one of my karaoke jams,

26:31.256 --> 26:33.025
so I'm excited to do that.

26:33.025 --> 26:38.363

and don't fuck it up.

30:00.832 --> 30:03.935
but you are still up

shaking in her boots,

30:18.183 --> 30:19.985
but, girl, you ain't
gonna win a lip sync

30:19.985 --> 30:21.386

-Congrats, babydoll.
-Yes.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.218
This feels like enough
redemption for Snatch Game.

30:53.218 --> 30:54.486
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, for sure.

30:54.486 --> 30:58.523
I am just so happy that
I get to watch and sit back.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.859
It is so much better this way,

31:00.859 --> 31:03.528
and it's like watching sports,
I imagine.

31:03.528 --> 31:04.696
Oh, here we go.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.932
Oh, boy, let's get comfy.

31:06.932 --> 31:10.402
Will the remaining queens
step to the front of the stage?

31:12.037 --> 31:14.473
All three of them
are great lip syncers.

31:14.473 --> 31:15.574
Oh, my fucking God.

31:15.574 --> 31:18.977
Ladies, how do you feel
about a three-way?

31:20.145 --> 31:21.947
-My favorite.
-Same.

31:21.947 --> 31:24.750
Because the fickle finger
of fate

31:24.750 --> 31:27.119
has chosen the three of you

31:27.119 --> 31:30.555
to lip sync
in our next smackdown.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.558
I wanna throw up.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.093
Let's do it.

31:35.093 --> 31:36.394
I do like threesomes.

31:36.394 --> 31:39.297
This'll be my first time
doing a threesome on stage,

31:39.297 --> 31:42.567
but, mm, okay.

31:42.567 --> 31:47.239
Now let's find out which queen
will choose the song.

31:48.306 --> 31:50.776
Oh, bitch!

31:50.776 --> 31:54.479
Calix, please do us the honor.

32:04.756 --> 32:08.326
Now, show us whose ball
you're holding.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.229
J.

32:11.229 --> 32:13.231
J is for Jorgeous.

32:14.232 --> 32:16.768
This is gonna be fun.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.538
Angeria and Lady Camden,

32:19.538 --> 32:22.107
they are probably gooped,
gabbed, and betribbled

32:22.107 --> 32:24.242
figuring out that Jorgeous
gets to pick the song.

32:24.242 --> 32:27.779
Jorgeous, what song
do you choose?

32:27.779 --> 32:30.749
Will it be Don't Let Go,

32:30.749 --> 32:32.984
Love Don't Cost a Thing,

32:32.984 --> 32:34.553
or Radio?

32:34.553 --> 32:35.687
She wants JLo hands down.

32:35.687 --> 32:38.089
She looks like JLo,
bitch, like--

32:38.089 --> 32:39.724
Honestly, you're right.

32:39.724 --> 32:40.959
[all laugh]

32:40.959 --> 32:42.194
If Jorgeous gets
Love Don't Cost a Thing,

32:42.194 --> 32:43.562
good luck to anybody else.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.664
I would just jump off the stage
onto a spike

32:45.664 --> 32:48.133
and end it all.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.902
Jorgeous, what song
do you choose?

32:50.902 --> 32:54.039
Ooh, this is
a lot of good options.

32:54.039 --> 32:56.374
Love Don't Cost a Thing.

32:56.374 --> 32:59.544
How about we do Radio
by Beyoncé?

32:59.544 --> 33:02.113
-What?
-Oh, shit!

33:02.113 --> 33:05.450
Oh, my God, I did not
see that shit coming.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.853
Radio by Beyoncé.

33:07.853 --> 33:09.721
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

33:09.721 --> 33:13.091
Three queens stand before me.

33:14.759 --> 33:17.929
Ladies, this is your chance
for one of you to impress me

33:17.929 --> 33:21.299
and save yourself
from elimination.

33:21.299 --> 33:24.870
The other two queens
will have to lip sync again.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.007
The time has come...
[thunder]

33:29.007 --> 33:32.277

33:37.515 --> 33:40.318
You know, I'm ready
to just fucking go for it.

33:40.318 --> 33:42.520
In my mind, I can hear
my motorcycle engine

33:42.520 --> 33:45.991
being, like, vroom, vroom,
vrr-vrr-vroom.

33:45.991 --> 33:47.259
Let's go.

Jorgeous.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.265
Thank y'all so much,

are still up for elimination.

36:59.084 --> 37:00.418
Okay.

37:01.486 --> 37:03.088
Jorgeous better come back here.

37:03.088 --> 37:05.657
-Oh, it'll be Jorgeous.
-And if it's not Jorgeous,

37:05.657 --> 37:06.658
I'm gonna be fucking shook.

37:06.658 --> 37:07.725
I'll be shocked.
I'll be shocked.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.461
Like, honestly,
I'm gonna be like, what?

37:09.461 --> 37:11.830
Hey, bitches of the world!
[all scream]

37:11.830 --> 37:15.133
Are you gagged?
Are you gagged, though?

37:15.133 --> 37:16.601
I saw Jorgeous
in a couple other lip syncs,

37:16.601 --> 37:17.902
but that was from behind.

37:17.902 --> 37:20.972
And now that I've seen her face,
it looks effortless.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.607
The obsession Ru has with you,

37:22.607 --> 37:24.742
I've always kind of been
a little jealous of,

37:24.742 --> 37:26.811
but I fucking understand it.

37:26.811 --> 37:28.713
I was watching that,
like, oh, my God,

37:28.713 --> 37:31.316
I am a Jorgeous stan, you know?

37:31.316 --> 37:34.552
Bitch, I'm recharged up now
after that gig, so...

37:34.552 --> 37:36.688
Well, let's go back
to this fucking lip sync.

37:36.688 --> 37:37.689
Yeah.

37:37.689 --> 37:40.425
Jasmine, Bosco,

37:40.425 --> 37:41.693
please step forward

37:41.693 --> 37:44.929
and join Angeria
and Lady Camden.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.666
This is full battle royale,

37:48.666 --> 37:52.504
and you have to continue on
and do another lip sync.

37:52.504 --> 37:55.006
If you lose three in a row,
you are out.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.976
I think we're all collectively
shitting our pants right now.

38:02.046 --> 38:05.917
My queens, it's time
for the fourth round

38:05.917 --> 38:10.688
of our Lip Sync
Lalaparuza Smackdown.

38:11.689 --> 38:13.658
Someone's going home today.

38:13.658 --> 38:15.059
Like, that reality sets in

38:15.059 --> 38:17.228
when I look around and see
that there's three other girls

38:17.228 --> 38:18.897
that I have to
battle up against.

38:18.897 --> 38:22.100
All four of them
are technically dancers.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.068
I'm slightly worried
about Bosco,

38:24.068 --> 38:26.804
just because out of
those four that are left,

38:26.804 --> 38:28.373
she gets in her head the most.

38:28.373 --> 38:32.010
Let's find out who will be
lip syncing next.

38:33.411 --> 38:35.880
Calix, please do us the honor.

38:40.418 --> 38:41.586
Please pick a ball.

38:46.224 --> 38:49.527
Show us whose ball
you are holding.

38:49.527 --> 38:50.862
LC.

38:54.432 --> 39:02.340
Camden, which queen
do you choose as your opponent?

39:03.641 --> 39:06.244
Think long and hard.

39:06.244 --> 39:10.315
This decision will follow you
for the rest of your life.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.020
I choose Bosco.

39:16.020 --> 39:19.324
-[gasps]
-Oh, my God.

39:19.324 --> 39:20.925
What the fuck?

39:20.925 --> 39:24.128
Well, fuck, guys.

39:24.128 --> 39:26.297
I'm immediately,
like, oh, shit,

39:26.297 --> 39:27.699
she's probably
mad at me right now.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.401
[laughs]

39:30.401 --> 39:32.036
It's a fucking competition.

39:34.005 --> 39:36.774
Angeria and Jasmine,

39:36.774 --> 39:38.843
you may step
to the back of the stage.

39:38.843 --> 39:42.847
I'm annoyed that Lady Camden
didn't pick me,

39:42.847 --> 39:46.084
because now I have to lip sync
against Angeria.

39:46.084 --> 39:48.052
[exhales]

39:48.052 --> 39:50.154
-Oh, why is she crying?
-She's crying?

39:50.154 --> 39:52.290
-Why is she crying?
-Because she loves Angie.

39:52.290 --> 39:54.859
I know, but, girl, come on,
get your head in the game.

39:56.227 --> 39:59.097
Bosco, now it's your turn.

39:59.097 --> 40:02.333
What song do you choose?

40:02.333 --> 40:04.335
Think long and hard, Bosco.

40:04.335 --> 40:10.208
Your future in this competition
may depend on your choice.

40:10.208 --> 40:14.345
Lady Camden is a fabulous
performer and dancer.

40:14.345 --> 40:17.181
She is a stunt queen,

40:17.181 --> 40:20.084
so that's not what
we're going to be doing today.

40:20.084 --> 40:24.589
Bosco, which song do you choose?

40:24.589 --> 40:27.158
Don't Let Go.

40:27.158 --> 40:30.728
Don't Let Go
by En Vogue.

40:30.728 --> 40:33.131
-I knew it.
-Bosco, you better turn out.

40:33.131 --> 40:34.866
Don't Let Go by En Vogue.

40:34.866 --> 40:36.367
I think it's a smart choice,

40:36.367 --> 40:39.337
because we've only seen Camden
do a million different splits

40:39.337 --> 40:40.705
and a million
different variations.

40:40.705 --> 40:42.473
That's not what
this song is about,

40:42.473 --> 40:44.442
so I think it's well played
by Bosco.

40:46.010 --> 40:50.148
Two queens stand before me.

40:50.148 --> 40:53.051
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me

40:53.051 --> 40:57.055
and save yourself
from elimination.

40:57.055 --> 40:59.023
The nerves set in,

40:59.023 --> 41:03.061
because I look like a giant,
neon pink skunk right now.

41:03.061 --> 41:06.230
I look like Sonic the Hedgehog's
bitch girlfriend.

41:06.230 --> 41:09.867
Like, how am I gonna do
this soulful song?

41:12.170 --> 41:14.339
The time has come...
[thunder]

41:14.339 --> 41:16.641

41:21.846 --> 41:23.681
This is my second time
lip syncing,

41:23.681 --> 41:25.416
so I'm a little tired.

41:25.416 --> 41:26.984
But back in the clubs,

41:26.984 --> 41:28.486
we have to do, like, three
or four numbers all the time,

41:28.486 --> 41:30.955
so I can definitely
handle this.

41:30.955 --> 41:37.028
Good luck,

43:45.289 --> 43:48.326
Ladies, I've made my decision.

43:53.498 --> 43:56.334
Lady Camden, shantay you stay.

43:58.603 --> 44:03.040
You are safe
to slay another day.

44:03.040 --> 44:05.376
[laughs]

44:05.376 --> 44:07.912
Yes, bitch, still here!

44:07.912 --> 44:08.913
Wonderful performance.

44:08.913 --> 44:11.282
You may leave the stage.

44:11.282 --> 44:13.084
Thank you.

44:13.084 --> 44:16.854
As I'm leaving the stage,
I'm just thinking I want a hug.

44:19.090 --> 44:21.392
Bosco, I'm sorry, my dear,

44:21.392 --> 44:24.028
but you are still up
for elimination.

44:24.028 --> 44:26.330
Don't give up.

44:26.330 --> 44:27.965
You still have a chance.

44:27.965 --> 44:32.336
Now please step
to the back of the stage.

44:36.007 --> 44:37.475
Not in the clear yet.

44:37.475 --> 44:41.779
I still have one chance to keep
my spot in this competition,

44:41.779 --> 44:45.683
but I really did not want it
to come this close.

44:49.620 --> 44:52.256
Oh, look, there's a fly
on my straw.

44:52.256 --> 44:54.058
Hello.

44:54.058 --> 44:55.059
-Eat it.
-Eat it.

44:55.059 --> 44:56.060
I'll give you a dollar.

44:56.060 --> 44:57.995
Oh, don't!

44:57.995 --> 44:59.463
They fully almost did it.

44:59.463 --> 45:01.532
I just fucking gagged.

45:01.532 --> 45:04.235
We did not get to see
who wins the lip sync,

45:04.235 --> 45:06.170
so we're all just waiting

45:06.170 --> 45:09.540
to see who's gonna be
coming through those doors.

45:09.540 --> 45:14.245
I felt like I wanted to be
inside of Lady...

45:15.646 --> 45:16.781
-...'s mind.
-Oh!

45:16.781 --> 45:19.750
I would be shook
if it's Bosco,

45:19.750 --> 45:22.019
but it's possible,
you never know.

45:22.019 --> 45:24.922
[cheering]

45:24.922 --> 45:26.524
Bitch, yes!

45:26.524 --> 45:27.825
Get your drink, girl,
get your drink.

45:27.825 --> 45:29.961
Can I have a hug, please?

45:29.961 --> 45:31.195
Camden!

45:31.195 --> 45:33.030
Come here, sister!

45:33.030 --> 45:36.367
-Camden!
-You did amazing!

45:36.367 --> 45:37.635
I just get so emotional,

45:37.635 --> 45:39.704
because I realize how much
I want this, you know,

45:39.704 --> 45:41.205
and how much
I wanna be here.

45:41.205 --> 45:42.373
You fucking slayed it.

45:42.373 --> 45:44.075
Our money was on you, girl.

45:44.075 --> 45:45.876
Whew, it's a lot, man.

45:45.876 --> 45:49.080
I don't know what just happened,
but I'm feeling very emotional.

45:49.080 --> 45:50.915
I have goosebumps.

45:50.915 --> 45:52.883
I was turned the fuck on,
to be honest.

45:52.883 --> 45:55.820
-[laughs]
-I was, like, oh, fuck.

45:55.820 --> 45:57.154
She wanted to top you.

45:57.154 --> 45:59.023
I was like, mm-hmm,
okay, Lady!

45:59.023 --> 46:02.059
-Cheers to Camden.
-Cheers, Camden!

46:02.059 --> 46:03.561
Cheers. Love you, Cam.

46:03.561 --> 46:04.996
Love you guys so much.

46:04.996 --> 46:07.898
-You turned it, bitch.
-Mm-hmm.

46:07.898 --> 46:11.602
Oh, my God, that scared
the shit outta me.

46:11.602 --> 46:16.841
Angeria, Jasmine,
please step forward.

46:16.841 --> 46:20.311
This moment feels really,
really weird right now for me,

46:20.311 --> 46:24.115
because I didn't wanna have
to lip sync against Jasmine.

46:24.115 --> 46:25.349
I love you.

46:25.349 --> 46:28.419
Jasmine and I have gotten,
like, really close.

46:28.419 --> 46:31.689
But at this point,
it's a competition,

46:31.689 --> 46:34.792
and I'm gonna
have to do what I do.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.427
Gosh.

46:36.427 --> 46:38.362
This is gonna be fucking fierce.

46:38.362 --> 46:42.833
Like, I know Jasmine is, like,
the bucker and the dancer,

46:42.833 --> 46:45.736
but Angie has, like,
a little something-something

46:45.736 --> 46:47.238
that I feel like
she's gonna bring to this.

46:47.238 --> 46:51.876
The fickle finger of fate
has chosen your pairing

46:51.876 --> 46:54.311
and your song:

46:54.311 --> 46:59.183
Love Don't Cost a Thing
by Jennifer Lopez.

46:59.183 --> 47:02.553
I've never performed
this song before,

47:02.553 --> 47:04.955
but I'm gonna
have to perform this song

47:04.955 --> 47:07.925
like I perform it every
Friday night at the club.

47:08.993 --> 47:12.296
Ladies, assume the positions.

47:13.898 --> 47:16.033
I love Angeria so much.

47:16.033 --> 47:17.601
I'm trying
to hold back my tears,

47:17.601 --> 47:20.971
but this is a competition,
and we have signed up for this,

47:20.971 --> 47:22.907
and if we have to lip sync
against each other,

47:22.907 --> 47:24.975
we have to lip sync
against each other.

47:24.975 --> 47:26.777
I have so much at stake
that I have to.

47:26.777 --> 47:30.481
Two queens stand before me.

47:30.481 --> 47:35.553
Ladies, this is your
second chance to impress me

47:35.553 --> 47:39.490
and save yourself
from elimination.

47:41.625 --> 47:43.794
The time has come...
[thunder]

47:43.794 --> 47:46.597
for you to lip sync...

47:46.597 --> 47:49.133

Good luck,

-That was good.
-That was sickening.

49:56.627 --> 50:01.031
I literally have zero idea
who would win.

50:01.031 --> 50:05.302
I don't know. I think
Jasmine did really good.

50:05.302 --> 50:07.538
Honestly, Angie
really knew the words,

50:07.538 --> 50:09.874
and she wasn't doing a lot,
she was embodying the song.

50:09.874 --> 50:11.208
She did know the words.

50:11.208 --> 50:13.811
The fast little parts
that our eye goes to

50:13.811 --> 50:16.080
to see if you know it, because
we know it's the hardest part,

50:16.080 --> 50:18.182
it's like, and if you don't
know it, you don't know it.

50:18.182 --> 50:20.017
There's a part of me that is
really wanting it to be Angie,

50:20.017 --> 50:21.285
but there's also part of me

50:21.285 --> 50:24.054
that's, like, Jasmine
did hold her fucking own.

50:24.054 --> 50:26.624
Angie can't leave this
competition right now.

50:26.624 --> 50:28.959
I need Angeria
to walk through that door.

50:28.959 --> 50:30.027
And not only do I want her
to come through the door,

50:30.027 --> 50:32.329
but I think
she really deserves it.

50:32.329 --> 50:34.298
I gotta give props
where it's due,

50:34.298 --> 50:37.234
and Jasmine, like,
gave the sex of it.

50:37.234 --> 50:38.335
There was a moment
where Jasmine,

50:38.335 --> 50:39.870
like, did this thing
with her body

50:39.870 --> 50:41.305
where her legs
were perfectly like this,

50:41.305 --> 50:43.307
and then her back went...

50:43.307 --> 50:45.743
and it was good.

50:45.743 --> 50:47.912
Some of the girls
think Angie's performance

50:47.912 --> 50:50.547
out-performed Jasmine,

50:50.547 --> 50:52.182
but if I'm being honest,

50:52.182 --> 50:55.586
Jasmine has an equal shot
to walk in the door right now,

50:55.586 --> 50:58.122
because Jasmine
did give it to me.

50:58.122 --> 50:59.390
I don't know. I don't know.

50:59.390 --> 51:01.558
It's close. It's close.

51:03.027 --> 51:05.562
Ladies, I've made my decision.

51:10.467 --> 51:13.837
Angeria, shantay you stay.

51:16.607 --> 51:20.778
You are safe
to slay another day.

51:20.778 --> 51:21.912
Thank you.

51:21.912 --> 51:24.048
Love you, baby.

51:24.048 --> 51:25.316
I love you.

51:25.316 --> 51:29.186
Whew. Whew. Whew.

51:29.186 --> 51:31.355
Oh, oh!

51:35.259 --> 51:36.760
All right, bitch.

51:36.760 --> 51:39.296
[cheering]
Whew, girl!

51:39.296 --> 51:42.099
And she lives
to slay another day.

51:42.099 --> 51:43.734
Oh, my God.

51:43.734 --> 51:45.269
You fucking turned it, bitch.

51:45.269 --> 51:46.870
And you looked so fucking
beautiful out there, bitch.

51:46.870 --> 51:48.339
Oh, my Angie!

51:48.339 --> 51:50.040
Good job, sister.

51:50.040 --> 51:51.342
I love you, Jasmine,

51:51.342 --> 51:53.677
but I just feel good
in this moment that I'm here.

51:53.677 --> 51:58.148
I'm just so happy
that I'm still here.

51:58.148 --> 51:59.183
Like, I--

51:59.183 --> 52:00.317
I'm so happy
you're still here.

52:00.317 --> 52:02.186
-Yeah.
-I'm just so happy she's safe

52:02.186 --> 52:03.988
and she can join me on the couch

52:03.988 --> 52:07.658
and we can cuddle while we watch
the one lip sync that's left.

52:07.658 --> 52:08.859
Who do you think
is gonna have to lip sync?

52:08.859 --> 52:11.195
[all laugh]

52:11.195 --> 52:16.333
So the final round comes down
to Jasmine and Bosco.

52:16.333 --> 52:19.169
I know that we love
to sort of tease Jasmine.

52:19.169 --> 52:21.171
I will say she's
the first person

52:21.171 --> 52:22.773
to be, like, well, I'm here,

52:22.773 --> 52:24.108
I'm gonna make
the most out of it.

52:24.108 --> 52:27.211
So I do feel like
she really has a great,

52:27.211 --> 52:29.780
almost relentlessly
positive attitude,

52:29.780 --> 52:31.715
which I think is great.

52:31.715 --> 52:33.183
Do you think Bosco's,
like, shitting right now?

52:33.183 --> 52:34.952
I think Bosco's
shitting right now.

52:34.952 --> 52:36.353
Well, I don't know, man.

52:36.353 --> 52:38.455
Bosco kind of has, like,
a fire, you know.

52:38.455 --> 52:41.325
I think she's fucking ready
to let Jasmine have it.

52:41.325 --> 52:42.760
She has a focus,

52:42.760 --> 52:44.928
and I'm sure that she's ready
to do what she needs to do.

52:44.928 --> 52:46.930
Whoever loses this one

52:46.930 --> 52:49.666
is gonna be the one
that's gonna be sent home.

52:49.666 --> 52:55.606
This is, like, the final,
like, it is now or never.

52:56.940 --> 52:59.576
All right, here we go.

52:59.576 --> 53:01.278
-So it begins.
-Oh, my God.

53:01.278 --> 53:03.347
Welcome back to the final round

53:03.347 --> 53:07.217
of our Lip Sync
Lalaparuza Smackdown.

53:07.217 --> 53:10.888
Ladies, you still have
one more chance

53:10.888 --> 53:14.191
to save yourself
from elimination.

53:14.191 --> 53:17.961
Bosco, Jasmine,
I want you to know

53:17.961 --> 53:22.599
that whoever leaves us tonight,
it's going to hurt.

53:23.801 --> 53:25.969
This is the one
for all the marbles.

53:25.969 --> 53:29.540
There is no time to be scared,
there's only time to be fierce.

53:31.909 --> 53:35.512
Two queens stand before me.

53:35.512 --> 53:37.181
It's primetime.

53:37.181 --> 53:38.982
This is do or die,
and I'm ready to do it.

53:38.982 --> 53:40.884
Prior to tonight,

53:40.884 --> 53:43.654
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

53:43.654 --> 53:48.158
of Swept Away
by the great Diana Ross.

53:48.158 --> 53:50.828
I am not going home.

53:50.828 --> 53:53.464
I'm gonna kick Jasmine's ass.

53:53.464 --> 53:56.834
This is your last chance
to impress me

53:56.834 --> 54:00.571
and save yourself
from elimination.

54:03.040 --> 54:05.008
The time has come...
[thunder]
