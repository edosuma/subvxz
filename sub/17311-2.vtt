00:11.075 --> 00:11.710
Tonight

00:11.778 --> 00:14.597
Hugh Grant stars in our reasonably-priced car

00:15.787 --> 00:18.192
and is the new Audi TT any good?

00:18.302 --> 00:20.833
We find out by playing golf.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:31.496 --> 00:33.062
Hello and welcome!

00:33.511 --> 00:34.417
Thank you for that!

00:36.127 --> 00:36.965
Thank you.

00:37.810 --> 00:38.369
Now

00:39.667 --> 00:41.149
Now as I'm sure you know...

00:42.342 --> 00:43.384
As I'm sure you know,

00:43.392 --> 00:47.659
James May is the slowest man in the entire world

00:48.133 --> 00:50.300
By the time he sets off anywhere normally his

00:50.509 --> 00:52.131
hair has grown another inch.

00:52.131 --> 00:53.997
So, plainly,

00:54.394 --> 00:57.434
He was the ideal man to try and max

00:57.552 --> 01:00.653
the fastest car in the world.

01:05.947 --> 01:08.597
"Vlad the impaler" is back.

01:14.337 --> 01:16.394
Last year, the mighty Bugatti Veyron

01:16.394 --> 01:19.213
starred in our greatest Top Gear Challenge ever

01:19.611 --> 01:22.865
when it raced an air-plane across the continent.

01:26.728 --> 01:29.088
In that film, Jeremy talked endlessly about

01:29.088 --> 01:33.168
the Veyron's ferocious power, and its incredible top speed.

01:34.048 --> 01:35.842
But because he was on public road

01:36.028 --> 01:38.085
he had to stick to the speed limit.

01:38.204 --> 01:39.059
Hahahaha..

01:42.864 --> 01:45.901
But today, we're not going to talk about it.

01:46.206 --> 01:47.075
We are going to do it.

01:47.219 --> 01:49.990
We're going to take the fastest production car in the world

01:50.025 --> 01:51.460
up to its top speed.

01:55.783 --> 01:59.531
That top speed is 253 mph.

02:00.211 --> 02:02.395
Much faster than a formular 1 car.

02:07.727 --> 02:09.556
and when you think that the Veyron has

02:09.564 --> 02:12.502
air-bags, air-conditioning, a stereo, a boot

02:12.502 --> 02:15.185
and all the other stuff F1 cars aren't burdened with

02:15.456 --> 02:18.513
You realize what an increadible machine this is!

02:21.257 --> 02:24.898
The Veyron is about pushing the outside of the envelope

02:24.898 --> 02:28.707
It's about doing things that people said just were not possible

02:29.113 --> 02:31.684
This car is a sort of "Concord" moment.

02:32.818 --> 02:37.771
Getting cars to do 155 mph frankly isn't really very difficult.

02:39.111 --> 02:43.691
the Veyron needs just a piffling 270 bhp to reach that speed.

02:44.241 --> 02:46.349
But 253!

02:47.073 --> 02:47.666
Crikey!

02:49.359 --> 02:50.552
the faster you go,

02:50.554 --> 02:53.568
the more Mother Nature tries to hold you back

02:54.470 --> 02:56.798
So to do the next 100 mph

02:56.806 --> 02:59.486
the 100 mhp that takes you up to 250

02:59.884 --> 03:04.034
needs another 730 Bhp.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.014
So what you end up with

03:08.057 --> 03:11.959
is a 16-cylinder engine with 4 turbo chargers

03:12.789 --> 03:15.606
producing 1001 horse power.

03:16.859 --> 03:18.918
and a lot of heat.

03:19.942 --> 03:22.443
That's why your car has 1 radiator

03:22.443 --> 03:24.364
and this car has 10.

03:26.468 --> 03:30.599
The engineers really worried
uncharted territory in this car.

03:30.599 --> 03:34.121
Here is an example, when they wanted to sort out the high speed dynamics

03:34.307 --> 03:36.703
They went to the Sauber F1 Team and they said

03:37.042 --> 03:38.845
"Do you mind awfully if we use your wind tunnel?"

03:39.048 --> 03:39.861
and they said

03:39.933 --> 03:43.099
"Terribly sorry, but we don't go up to those speeds"

03:44.293 --> 03:47.525
In fact, cracking 253 mph

03:47.525 --> 03:49.760
cause nighimare after nightmaire.

03:50.014 --> 03:55.184
But Bugatti insist that this 850,000 pound car can do it.

03:58.454 --> 04:02.695
Mind you, actually testing their bold claim is a bit of a palaver.

04:05.557 --> 04:07.250
This is Ehra-Lessien

04:07.411 --> 04:10.888
Volkswagon's maximum security test track in Germany

04:11.853 --> 04:13.597
When it was built during the cold war

04:13.801 --> 04:17.805
It was delibrately sited in a no fly zone
near the east German border

04:20.428 --> 04:24.467
in order to stop prying eyes from seeing secret prototypes

04:27.659 --> 04:30.526
It has over 16 miles of private track.

04:30.734 --> 04:33.375
But the bit we are interested in is the main straight,

04:33.578 --> 04:36.666
which is a whopping 5.5 miles long.

04:38.664 --> 04:41.405
Although it is technically a flat and level road.

04:41.405 --> 04:44.873
You stand here, you can't actually see the other end

04:45.118 --> 04:48.375
and that's because it's following the curvature of the earth.

04:52.051 --> 04:53.651
But even when you've sorted the venue

04:53.795 --> 04:56.326
you can't just jump in the car and go.

04:59.538 --> 05:02.437
This is Germany, there are procedures to go through.

05:03.254 --> 05:04.660
I like procedures

05:07.867 --> 05:11.321
You have to insert a special key into a slot by the door.

05:13.336 --> 05:15.659
And when you do, the diffuser flaps close.

05:16.404 --> 05:18.030
the rear spoiler retracts

05:18.557 --> 05:22.392
and the whole car hunkers down to became as slippery as possible

05:29.341 --> 05:32.115
The telemetry box we're using to record the speed

05:32.140 --> 05:33.662
measures in kilometers an hours.

05:34.017 --> 05:37.810
So the magic number we are looking for is 407

05:39.088 --> 05:40.223
Right ladies and gentleman

05:40.316 --> 05:42.906
Here we go. I'm approaching the
banking on the top of the circuit

05:42.906 --> 05:45.133
I have to do this in 200 kph

05:45.133 --> 05:46.468
That's about 120

05:46.789 --> 05:47.644
Round the banking

05:47.992 --> 05:49.415
look for my acceleration point

05:49.424 --> 05:52.014
then give it the beans down the straight

05:59.501 --> 06:02.557
200 kph, that's 120

06:04.792 --> 06:07.947
To get the car settled fourth gear 5000 revs

06:14.389 --> 06:17.107
Looking for the exit where I bury it.

06:20.581 --> 06:21.241
Here we go!

06:24.390 --> 06:27.392
The climb from 200 to 300 kph

06:27.536 --> 06:30.363
was over in just 9.4 seconds

06:31.185 --> 06:34.466
The world, viewers, is a total blur!

06:36.633 --> 06:38.684
I'm already doing 330 Kph

06:38.684 --> 06:40.401
Going too quick, I can't do the math.

06:41.634 --> 06:43.901
Gettng up to about 350

06:46.290 --> 06:51.589
Captain Slow is doing 360 kph... 370

06:53.038 --> 06:55.349
That's 230 miles per hour.

06:55.527 --> 06:57.915
I was now leaving F1 cars behind

06:59.118 --> 07:01.488
It's no wonder Micheal Schumacher retired.

07:01.830 --> 07:03.582
He's slower than me!

07:05.110 --> 07:06.312
At this sort of speed

07:06.312 --> 07:09.639
this engine is sucking in as much air in a minute

07:09.639 --> 07:13.153
as I breathe in four days

07:14.545 --> 07:15.967
Getting close to the maximum

07:15.967 --> 07:19.320
which means the tires would only last for about 15 minutes

07:19.987 --> 07:20.817
But it's OK

07:21.071 --> 07:24.297
Because the fuel runs out in 12 minutes

07:27.023 --> 07:30.590
This is a road car and I'm getting up to 404

07:31.919 --> 07:33.290
405, come on!

07:35.443 --> 07:37.084
Come on give me one more!

07:40.948 --> 07:42.073
406!

07:42.073 --> 07:44.752
Come on I need one more, one more!

08:02.458 --> 08:06.751
I'm covering a football pitch every second

08:23.567 --> 08:24.643
That...

08:25.244 --> 08:26.361
I'm pretty confident

08:26.361 --> 08:29.324
that's as fast as I'm ever gonna go in a car.

08:31.673 --> 08:32.332
Increadible

08:33.306 --> 08:34.059
That is ...

08:35.015 --> 08:36.886
it's made my eyes water.

08:50.889 --> 08:52.379
I am impressed, James

08:53.463 --> 08:54.021
OK.

08:56.341 --> 08:57.052
thing is though, OK.

08:57.052 --> 08:58.415
You know when you take

08:58.491 --> 09:02.483
a Ferrari or a Lamborghini or particularly a Koenigzegg to its top speed...

09:02.483 --> 09:04.414
- No.
- No, actually you wouldn't

09:04.414 --> 09:05.904
But anyway, when you do

09:05.904 --> 09:07.276
They fizz they buzz

09:07.276 --> 09:09.584
They feels like all the body panels are peeling away

09:09.584 --> 09:13.620
'cause you're right on the edge of what's physically and technically possible.

09:13.984 --> 09:15.397
Really? I didn't get any of that with this..

09:15.397 --> 09:17.439
To be honest, the only thing I've got was at the end of the straight

09:17.439 --> 09:20.589
I had to touch the breaks, so you see the spoiler come up slowing down.

09:20.674 --> 09:21.538
You got a sort of ...

09:22.824 --> 09:23.508
And that's it?

09:23.508 --> 09:24.226
Yeah, just...

09:24.412 --> 09:26.410
So it's kind of safe and relaxing

09:26.977 --> 09:29.044
even at 250 miles an hour

09:29.180 --> 09:30.119
Absolutely, yeah.

09:30.119 --> 09:31.778
It's... totally undramatic.

09:31.785 --> 09:33.195
But I would give you a bit of warning

09:33.195 --> 09:36.007
which is a bit disorientating doing that sort of speed.

09:36.007 --> 09:37.905
'Cause, after I come off the banking

09:38.066 --> 09:39.209
I was slowing down to stop

09:39.209 --> 09:41.479
You know how you get a bit impatient, you think "I'll just open the door"

09:41.817 --> 09:44.725
Fortunately I looked back at the speedo and I was still doing 70

09:46.418 --> 09:47.796
Umm..OK, so.

09:48.304 --> 09:50.996
We've established that this is faster across Europe than

09:51.733 --> 09:53.236
- your light ari-craft
- Yepp.

09:53.303 --> 09:56.639
We've established that it realy will do 250 mph

09:56.749 --> 10:00.976
But we've never been able to find out
how fast it'll go round our track

10:01.562 --> 10:04.212
Now the problem is Bugatti are
happy for us to have one here.

10:04.517 --> 10:05.963
They are happy for you to go and do that.

10:05.963 --> 10:07.486
But they won't lend the Stig one.

10:08.048 --> 10:09.682
Umm..So really, this is an appeal.

10:09.682 --> 10:11.155
If you've got a Veyron

10:12.585 --> 10:14.544
and you'd like to lend it to us.

10:14.629 --> 10:17.647
We're prepared to pay anything up to 30 pounds

10:19.600 --> 10:20.600
And now the news

10:20.600 --> 10:22.320
and we start off with the Porsche Cayenne because

10:22.320 --> 10:23.620
they've revised it and come out with a new one

10:23.620 --> 10:25.970
It's got new prices, new bits and pieces, new engines,

10:25.970 --> 10:28.120
But the most important thing of course about a Cayenne is

10:28.120 --> 10:30.650
it's never been the best-looking car, is it?

10:30.650 --> 10:32.170
No, not even slightly.

10:32.170 --> 10:34.350
Well, we can only assume that this new one

10:34.350 --> 10:36.500
still isn't exactly the best-looking car

10:36.500 --> 10:40.020
because well, here is the official photograph
that Porsche sent out for us.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.600
I can hear the discussion of the
photographer had actually with the director.

10:48.600 --> 10:51.050
He said "Is the light good for you?"
and he said "No, there is still is some."

10:51.050 --> 10:52.400
Yes, exactly.

10:53.400 --> 10:57.900
Now, hey, you know that young Russian business kid

10:57.900 --> 10:59.800
who bought TVR a couple of years ago?

10:59.800 --> 11:00.200
Yeah.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.570
Yeah, we've got a picture of him here at a business meeting

11:02.570 --> 11:03.650
- Oh, yeah, there he is
- There

11:05.950 --> 11:09.020
Did he close down the factory in Blackpool and make everyone redundant.

11:09.020 --> 11:12.850
Exactly, well, it turns out that all the TVR owners have decided

11:12.850 --> 11:16.470
that they're gonna throw a party for the
workers who've all been made redundant.

11:16.470 --> 11:18.570
The party dubbed fundable

11:18.570 --> 11:20.600
will include a buffet dinner,

11:20.600 --> 11:23.520
How much do I don't want to go to that?

11:23.520 --> 11:26.770
Err, bar disco and live band.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.270
Wahl, a TVR band.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.770
So they'll play presumably really loud really fast

11:30.770 --> 11:32.320
and then burst into flames.

11:34.500 --> 11:38.600
Here's some news, you know the hot
Renault Clio, there was a really fast one

11:38.600 --> 11:39.950
They've done a even hotter one, OK?

11:39.950 --> 11:41.270
It's call the R27

11:41.270 --> 11:42.600
It's got a lower stiffer chassis.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.720
We've got a photograph of it here, OK?

11:44.720 --> 11:47.750
Now, these are the four Renault formula 1 racing drivers, OK,

11:47.750 --> 11:48.820
for this year.

11:49.150 --> 11:51.370
Now this chap, OK, the new one,

11:51.370 --> 11:52.550
He really likes this car,

11:52.550 --> 11:53.750
he is very excited by it.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.450
He is very, very excited...

12:00.820 --> 12:02.620
He is very pleased to see it, isn't he?

12:02.620 --> 12:05.200
Really pleased.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.470
What I love as well,

12:09.470 --> 12:12.170
If you look around the other guys,
who clearly spotted the problem.

12:12.170 --> 12:13.570
Well, you could hardly miss it, could you.

12:13.570 --> 12:16.100
They're all very embarrassed. Don't look

12:16.100 --> 12:19.970
Well, you see this, Ok, I got this
photograph from a French website.

12:19.970 --> 12:22.820
The actually official photograph
that was sent to it by Renault

12:22.820 --> 12:24.070
Let me show it to you.

12:24.070 --> 12:26.900
Look, there's he, go and stand behind the car now.

12:26.900 --> 12:29.750
- Look how embarrassing he is.
- But they are all racing drivers.

12:29.750 --> 12:33.050
Couldn't they've lent a crash helmet
to hold it in the appropriate way.

12:33.050 --> 12:35.800
It was his crash helmet that caused
the problem in the first place.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.700
Leave it...

12:37.700 --> 12:38.920
Err, oh, now

12:39.450 --> 12:41.650
News from the director of public prosecutions

12:41.650 --> 12:42.970
who I discovered in the paper this week

12:42.970 --> 12:44.050
he is called Can or something rather

12:44.050 --> 12:45.270
Not called Can.

12:45.270 --> 12:47.970
Can is the name of a man you borrow a step ladder from

12:47.970 --> 12:48.400
Yeah.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.220
Not the director of public prosecutions.

12:50.220 --> 12:54.150
Can has announced that there is a
whole raft of new motoring offences

12:54.150 --> 12:56.400
for which you can go to prison, OK?

12:56.400 --> 12:57.950
One of them is,

12:57.950 --> 13:00.150
retuning your radio.

13:00.150 --> 13:01.150
- Oh, don't, it's stupid. - What?

13:01.150 --> 13:02.020
Seriously

13:02.020 --> 13:03.800
But what if the Archers comes on?

13:05.670 --> 13:08.600
I can't listen to an episode of the Archers in the car

13:08.600 --> 13:12.420
without losing my temper and having
a crash deliberately to end it?

13:14.800 --> 13:16.020
Can has decided

13:16.020 --> 13:17.720
that we'll have to tolerate these things,

13:17.720 --> 13:19.300
cause you're not allowed to retune a radio,

13:19.300 --> 13:21.650
you're also not allowed to put lipstick on.

13:21.650 --> 13:23.450
Again, what...

13:25.300 --> 13:28.050
But get this one. You are not
allowed now to be an undertaker.

13:28.050 --> 13:29.720
What? I don't got it, an undertaker?

13:29.720 --> 13:31.200
You an undertaker?

13:31.200 --> 13:33.200
You're undertaker? You're going to prison.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.600
Can says, Can says if you "undertake" someone,

13:38.600 --> 13:40.300
Oh, hang on.

13:41.650 --> 13:45.020
Well, it's... I've always had been a bit of beef about this.

13:45.020 --> 13:47.270
because I reckon if you go pass someone on the inside,

13:47.270 --> 13:48.350
There was room to do that,

13:48.350 --> 13:51.050
there was room for them to have got
out of the way in the first place.

13:54.070 --> 13:55.114
It's wrong!

13:55.114 --> 13:57.350
They are the ones who should be prosecuted.

13:57.350 --> 14:00.100
They can't find prisons to put pedophiles in.

14:00.100 --> 14:03.400
But they're going to be putting
him in it for being an undertaker.

14:03.400 --> 14:04.770
It's ridiculous.

14:04.770 --> 14:06.920
You know actually they can't find the pedophiles

14:06.920 --> 14:08.070
cause 300 have got missing.

14:08.070 --> 14:09.650
I know where they are.

14:09.650 --> 14:11.770
If you drive down the outside lane of the motorway

14:11.770 --> 14:14.820
now, not retune the radio at 50 miles an hour, OK?

14:14.820 --> 14:17.450
You are immune from prosecution, OK?

14:17.450 --> 14:21.070
So it's the ideal place to go if
you're being looked for by the law.

14:21.070 --> 14:26.120
So therefore anyone doing 50 in
the outside lane of the motorway

14:26.120 --> 14:27.900
is a child molester.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.750
Wahl, that's amazing.

14:30.750 --> 14:33.300
You use logic, there. That's incredible.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.850
Argue with that.

14:34.850 --> 14:36.370
Hey, now, can I just say, OK

14:36.370 --> 14:38.900
it's been a while since we sat here as a group as you know,

14:38.900 --> 14:40.200
so I thought it would be a good idea

14:40.200 --> 14:44.020
just to count through a few of the good cars and
bad cars we've driven when we've been off air

14:44.020 --> 14:47.050
and I have to say, good cars for me, Lexus.

14:47.050 --> 14:50.170
particularly, actually, the GS, the one in the middle

14:50.170 --> 14:51.000
I'm with you.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.300
The hybrid one, mate

14:52.300 --> 14:53.920
No, no, this one, OK?

14:53.920 --> 14:55.650
This looks like a normal car.

14:55.650 --> 14:56.750
The great thing is, OK,

14:56.750 --> 14:59.420
its batteries will only take you less than a mile

14:59.420 --> 15:02.170
which means most of the time you are on the V6, you know,

15:02.170 --> 15:03.620
you chewing fuel, you warming the world,

15:03.620 --> 15:05.070
and everybody is happy, OK?

15:05.070 --> 15:06.920
It's very quiet, it's very fast,

15:06.920 --> 15:08.500
it's very very comfortable.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.070
And of course you can drive it to London,

15:10.070 --> 15:12.150
do U turns on Piccadilly all day long

15:12.150 --> 15:14.020
can't Livingston cop charge you a penny.

15:14.020 --> 15:15.170
- Brilliant car there. - It is a hybrid.

15:15.170 --> 15:17.100
It's a properly brilliant car there.

15:17.100 --> 15:20.070
I'm gonna put like a little 9 volt battery in a Hummer.

15:22.350 --> 15:23.570
It's a hybrid.

15:26.370 --> 15:31.170
I was very impressed if I maybe buy the Suzuki Swift Sport.

15:31.170 --> 15:32.220
- I am. - No, it's...

15:32.220 --> 15:34.350
This is the most underrated

15:34.970 --> 15:37.700
It's not going over well mate, it's not going over well.

15:37.700 --> 15:40.570
Before you all chime in, it's a small car, but,

15:40.570 --> 15:42.300
you know I'm not a big fan of the new Mini

15:42.300 --> 15:44.820
I've just... It's too big and lump and all the rest of it

15:44.820 --> 15:47.100
That I think is the new Mini.

15:47.100 --> 15:49.550
Try it, you'll be amazed. It's brilliant that car.

15:49.550 --> 15:50.550
That's an order from him.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.320
Actually, to be honest, I quite like that as well.

15:52.320 --> 15:55.420
I, I... actually really did the Volvo C30.

15:55.420 --> 15:56.470
I know, don't think I gone mad.

15:56.470 --> 15:57.870
But it's a good looking car.

15:57.870 --> 16:00.270
And you can get it with a 5 cylinder engine

16:00.270 --> 16:03.770
which is exactly the same one
as in the Focus ST, the hot one.

16:03.770 --> 16:05.350
Worst cars, no question for me.

16:05.350 --> 16:08.850
One of the top 5 worst cars I've ever driven. VW Golf GT.

16:08.850 --> 16:09.670
There.

16:09.670 --> 16:12.470
No, seriously, it's got a supercharged
and turbocharged engine,

16:12.470 --> 16:16.270
which is as smooth as falling down
stairs while wearing leg calipers.

16:18.750 --> 16:23.800
Basically if you tend to buy one of those, honestly,
just work harder and buy the Golf GTI.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.770
- There is a Top Gear top tip.
- Good advice.

16:25.770 --> 16:28.150
I was pretty disappointed, I hate I have to say

16:28.150 --> 16:30.850
this a Bentley Arnage T, not the R

16:30.850 --> 16:32.100
which is brilliant.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.320
This is a useful consumer advice for people in the north.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.170
Well actually it is.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.300
And I'm sorry it is.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.650
Because the T has a bit more power and a bit more torque

16:40.650 --> 16:41.970
and it's just enough to spoil it.

16:41.970 --> 16:44.320
If you stick with the R, which is the beautiful car,

16:44.320 --> 16:46.670
they cost 12,000 pounds less so you can buy a house.

16:49.770 --> 16:52.550
For me, it was the Subaru Tribeca

16:52.550 --> 16:54.850
which is a MPV and technically it's not bad

16:54.850 --> 16:57.150
but it's hideous and it's a family car.

16:57.150 --> 17:00.170
So my kids would too terrify to get in it.

17:00.170 --> 17:03.600
Hating it. it's not... it's just... it's hideous.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.220
Hey, now, Jaguar have made a concept car.

17:06.220 --> 17:07.500
Well, not another one.

17:07.500 --> 17:08.950
It's why they never make any money, isn't it?

17:08.950 --> 17:10.619
because they just keep making concept cars all the time

17:10.619 --> 17:12.650
instead of just making cars that you can buy.

17:12.650 --> 17:16.099
Well I know, they haven't understood
that if you sell a car, you get money.

17:16.099 --> 17:16.920
Yeah.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.450
Anyway, this one, OK?

17:18.450 --> 17:20.200
They say, which I've got a picture of it here.

17:20.200 --> 17:24.020
OK? They say, that's going to be the next S type.

17:24.020 --> 17:25.920
It will be looking exactly the same as that.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.220
Well, if that's true, that's fantastic news.

17:27.220 --> 17:28.170
It looks brilliant.

17:28.170 --> 17:30.020
I know. It does. I went to see it in the flesh the other day.

17:30.020 --> 17:31.300
The designer was there and he said

17:31.300 --> 17:34.250
"I assure you, the S type will look exactly like that."

17:34.250 --> 17:36.770
If that car comes out like that,

17:36.770 --> 17:38.070
I'll cut my left leg off,

17:38.070 --> 17:39.900
beat myself to death with it.

17:40.900 --> 17:42.270
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:42.270 --> 17:42.970
Do it.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.320
Make it, just make it.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.300
Now, if you're looking to spend between

17:49.300 --> 17:52.570
20,000 and 25,000 pounds on a coupe,

17:52.570 --> 17:55.650
your choice just became a lot more complicated.

17:55.650 --> 17:57.650
So, to see if we could help you out,

17:57.650 --> 18:00.500
the three of us have been to Scotland for a row.

18:06.870 --> 18:09.700
These are of the cars that have caused the problem.

18:10.150 --> 18:12.700
There is the new Audi TT,

18:13.150 --> 18:15.450
the new Alfa Romeo Brera,

18:15.750 --> 18:21.150
and the not so new, but still quite interesting Mazda RX-8

18:23.000 --> 18:25.620
So, let's start with the Audi.

18:30.820 --> 18:33.100
Now I want to make it absolutely plain that

18:33.100 --> 18:35.170
I did not like the old TT.

18:35.170 --> 18:39.870
Because all they did to make it
was put a Golf in a pretty front.

18:39.870 --> 18:43.220
That's like putting a cow in a track suit.

18:43.220 --> 18:45.900
Still not gonna win any running races.

18:46.520 --> 18:50.400
With this new one though, they really have gone to towns.

18:51.650 --> 18:55.400
It's longer, wider and more aggressive than the old model.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.900
And even though this is the baby of the range,

18:57.900 --> 18:59.870
it's more technical as well.

19:01.700 --> 19:03.450
Take the body for example,

19:03.450 --> 19:05.200
from here back, it's steel,

19:05.200 --> 19:07.920
from here forwards, it's aluminum.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.570
And that not only makes the car lighter,

19:09.570 --> 19:12.120
it's actually 9 stone less than the old TT,

19:12.120 --> 19:14.600
it also improves weight distribution.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.370
Then there is the suspension,

19:16.370 --> 19:19.420
the fluid in the shock absorber has got iron filings in it,

19:19.420 --> 19:21.570
then round the outside there is a magnet,

19:21.570 --> 19:23.970
turn the magnet on, your iron filings move about,

19:23.970 --> 19:26.220
everything becomes firmer.

19:26.220 --> 19:28.900
And how much do you not want to go on a holiday

19:28.900 --> 19:31.220
with a man who thought of that.

19:32.850 --> 19:38.120
The upshot is, this is no longer a cow in a track suit.

19:38.700 --> 19:42.520
It's a cow GTI in racing overall.

19:47.700 --> 19:50.620
The steering in the old car was numb,

19:50.620 --> 19:52.670
in this, it feels connected.

19:52.670 --> 19:56.400
The ride in the old car was as comfortable
as falling down a flight of stairs,

19:56.400 --> 20:00.200
in this, it's smooth when the iron filings are dormant

20:00.200 --> 20:03.400
and then when you push the switch to turn the magnets on

20:08.020 --> 20:11.050
it becomes racing car sharp.

20:14.400 --> 20:18.450
This is not a car for taking your
hair to the hair dresses any more,

20:18.450 --> 20:21.900
this is a car for making your hair stand on end

20:21.900 --> 20:24.128
it's a proper sports car.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.800
Rubbish!

20:31.750 --> 20:34.050
What you want is one of these.

20:34.050 --> 20:37.870
This is the new Alfa Romeo Brera.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.020
It's a brilliant car.

20:47.350 --> 20:50.750
On the face of it, the Alfa is exactly like the TT.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.620
They are both four-seat coupes,

20:54.270 --> 20:56.320
they've both got four-cylinder engines,

20:56.320 --> 20:58.370
they've both got six-speed gearboxes,

20:58.370 --> 21:01.270
they both cost around 24,000 pounds,

21:01.270 --> 21:07.600
and they'll both also be available with
3.2 Liter V6 engines and four-wheel drive.

21:08.970 --> 21:12.170
But actually, this is not like a TT at all.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.600
Now we've said this time and again on Top Gear

21:21.600 --> 21:24.700
You can not consider yourself a true petrolhead

21:24.700 --> 21:27.100
until you've owned an Alfa Romeo.

21:27.100 --> 21:29.070
They're not cars for posers,

21:29.070 --> 21:30.970
they're cars for connoisseurs.

21:30.970 --> 21:33.970
there're some times, they'll infuriate you

21:33.970 --> 21:36.700
other times, they're really gonna thrill and excite you,

21:36.700 --> 21:41.200
but the point is: they're never, ever boring.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.820
It was not designed like the Audi,

21:47.820 --> 21:51.150
using just science and technology and iron filings,

21:51.150 --> 21:53.300
It also has soul and passion.

21:53.300 --> 21:55.070
This car has a heart.

21:56.420 --> 21:58.620
But you know what really swings it for me?

21:59.570 --> 22:01.400
It's the interior.

22:01.920 --> 22:06.100
Sitting in here feels like you're sitting
in a Milanese's espresso bar.

22:06.870 --> 22:11.320
Sitting in the Audi feels like you're
trapped in a Berlin post office.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.000
OK, then, James,

22:14.000 --> 22:17.920
have you told the ladies and gentlemen
how fast the Brera goes from 0-60

22:18.320 --> 22:21.420
No, I haven't and I was rather
hoping you wouldn't bring it up.

22:21.420 --> 22:22.820
But never mind, ladies and gentlemen,

22:22.820 --> 22:24.850
it does it in 8.1 seconds.

22:24.850 --> 22:28.220
Which in 1976 would have been considered pretty brisk.

22:28.670 --> 22:31.370
James, you could be out dragged but a canoe boat.

22:31.370 --> 22:32.520
It's not a slow car,

22:32.520 --> 22:34.670
it's just not quite as quick as your car.

22:34.670 --> 22:37.470
which is a car for people who use moisturizing products.

22:37.470 --> 22:38.470
James, I'm with you.

22:38.470 --> 22:41.100
I prefer an Alfa to an Audi.

22:41.100 --> 22:43.020
But not that Alfa Romeo,

22:43.020 --> 22:45.550
that's too slow and that's an end of it.

22:45.550 --> 22:47.400
It's not too slow, it's plenty fast enough...

22:47.400 --> 22:49.320
James, our colleague has arrived.

22:49.320 --> 22:50.450
Here he is

22:50.450 --> 22:52.400
Lord Woolworth is here.

22:56.120 --> 22:59.400
If it's power you want, then this is your answer.

23:02.250 --> 23:05.170
The wankel engined Mazda RX-8.

23:05.950 --> 23:07.420
When it comes to speed,

23:08.120 --> 23:11.420
it will do 0-60 in 6.4 seconds,

23:13.270 --> 23:16.920
That's a bit faster than the Audi and
a whole lot faster than the Alfa.

23:17.620 --> 23:20.500
Top speed, 'round 150.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.120
Put it on a track,

23:25.120 --> 23:28.570
and you quickly realize what this car is all about.

23:33.070 --> 23:36.250
About this engine, it is different, it's a rotary.

23:36.250 --> 23:38.420
So you use it differently.

23:40.220 --> 23:42.150
All the power is at the top end.

23:42.150 --> 23:45.900
So you can crush it mercilessly,

23:45.900 --> 23:48.300
an it will thank you for it.

23:50.270 --> 23:51.900
There is something else too.

23:51.900 --> 23:55.400
The Alfa is basically just an Alfa saloon underneath,

23:55.400 --> 23:58.950
And the Audi is just an Golf in a fancy front.

24:00.170 --> 24:03.120
The RX-8, however, is bespoke.

24:03.120 --> 24:07.720
It was designed from the ground up
to be a preliminary sports car.

24:07.720 --> 24:11.420
This is the only one with rear wheel drive.

24:12.500 --> 24:16.420
It is a proper blue-blooded driver's car.

24:16.950 --> 24:21.270
Listen to that, 7, 8 ,9

24:21.270 --> 24:23.070
And yet despite all that,

24:23.070 --> 24:25.250
it has four doors.

24:25.650 --> 24:29.220
You see, you got your big door
at the front, usual sort of thing,

24:29.220 --> 24:32.950
then you got the little door for back seat passengers.

24:32.950 --> 24:34.470
Look at that.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.220
It's brilliant.

24:38.700 --> 24:41.650
There're a few disadvantages I admit.

24:42.100 --> 24:45.850
You'll struggle to get more than 23 MPG,

24:45.850 --> 24:48.350
it uses quite a lot of oil,

24:49.900 --> 24:52.620
and the depreciation is a bit steep.

24:54.450 --> 24:59.320
But then a RX-8 is 2,000 pounds
cheaper to buy than the others,

25:01.400 --> 25:03.450
and 2000 times better.

25:03.450 --> 25:06.350
And I don't care what those other idiots say.

25:11.350 --> 25:12.800
A tricky decision then,

25:12.800 --> 25:16.520
three similar cars, but three different opinions.

25:17.620 --> 25:19.400
To see if we could find a winner,

25:19.400 --> 25:20.850
the three of us needed to meet up.

25:20.850 --> 25:23.770
So this being Scotland, the home of golf.

25:24.620 --> 25:27.450
We decided to break out the Pringle.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.700
What will you be using here?

25:29.700 --> 25:31.000
How the hell do I know?

25:31.000 --> 25:33.650
I've never ever played golf.

25:33.650 --> 25:35.550
And it's like that, isn't it?

25:35.550 --> 25:36.470
I can't believe you.

25:36.470 --> 25:38.320
You seem to look like somebody who've done it...

25:38.320 --> 25:41.200
Hahaha...

25:43.020 --> 25:47.250
You've got dressed up in that outfit to do that.

25:47.250 --> 25:48.900
To be honest, I could've carried it that far.

25:48.900 --> 25:50.620
That doesn't look right.

25:50.620 --> 25:52.570
How could it not look right?

25:52.570 --> 25:55.350
Shut up, watch and learn.

25:55.350 --> 25:57.450
- Wow! - It's gone in the sea.

25:57.450 --> 26:00.000
- It's gone in the sea.
- Yeah.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.400
I will tell you what, Richard,

26:01.400 --> 26:03.250
Your Mazda would look good here.

26:03.250 --> 26:05.470
Get off, it is not a golfist's car.

26:05.470 --> 26:06.870
- It is actually. - That actually is.

26:06.870 --> 26:09.820
I'm fairly confident you won't see
an Alfa Romeo in the car park.

26:09.820 --> 26:10.450
No, we won't.

26:10.450 --> 26:12.820
But I'm afraid I could see your car as well.

26:12.820 --> 26:14.420
- TT? - Yeah.

26:14.620 --> 26:16.300
TT is the car for the kind of man who

26:16.300 --> 26:18.450
matches his belt to the little tag on these trousers

26:18.450 --> 26:20.520
and he is then proud and pleased with that.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.900
- What do they do and got they could do this, don't they?

26:22.900 --> 26:24.270
He's gonna do it again.

26:24.270 --> 26:27.100
- It's like his pre-fly checks
- I'll kill him, I'm going to kill him.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.100
That's quite...

26:29.100 --> 26:30.400
Well it wasn't bad.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.020
Well, it was.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.670
I just got a hole in 21.

26:36.650 --> 26:40.020
We were extremely quick at getting to a new hole.

26:40.020 --> 26:41.020
Oh

26:41.520 --> 26:44.750
- Oh, no...
- Hahaha

26:44.750 --> 26:47.220
Oh, well done.

26:47.220 --> 26:48.800
But every time we got there...

26:48.800 --> 26:51.470
Yes! Hahaha

26:51.470 --> 26:54.050
... things slowed down again.

26:54.050 --> 26:56.020
Are you using an ace?

26:56.020 --> 26:57.920
Partly because we were useless

26:57.920 --> 27:01.420
and partly because we kept arguing about our cars.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.750
That Mazda is chintzy, it's nearly as chintzy as...

27:03.750 --> 27:06.150
Chintzy? I'm sorry, I just...

27:06.150 --> 27:08.550
Both of your cars are pompous...

27:08.550 --> 27:11.470
Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish...

27:11.470 --> 27:13.070
OK how long you wanna me keep saying rubbish?

27:13.070 --> 27:17.400
This annoyed the proper men of Pringle
who were queuing up behind us.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.020
There is no Roush leather in the Audi, there is no...

27:19.020 --> 27:20.420
Well, practically, it might as well be Roush.

27:20.420 --> 27:21.620
There're people behind us, they're very angry...

27:21.620 --> 27:22.320
I know there're people waiting on

27:22.320 --> 27:25.170
I'm trying just to get on with it, yeah, I know.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.100
Nope.

27:27.100 --> 27:29.570
After an hour we reached the third hole

27:29.570 --> 27:31.270
and were still arguing.

27:31.270 --> 27:32.550
You are completely wrong about the Mazda.

27:32.550 --> 27:33.700
Technically it may be good

27:33.700 --> 27:34.920
it may be fantastic on the track,

27:34.920 --> 27:36.350
but it's not what's it about on the road.

27:36.350 --> 27:37.500
It's too jigly,

27:37.500 --> 27:39.000
- it's too harsh the interior,
- Jigly?

27:39.000 --> 27:41.500
Just because the Alfa is slightly slower,

27:41.500 --> 27:44.520
- You think it must be able to...
- It's not slightly slower, James.

27:44.520 --> 27:45.600
It's a little bit slower in the real world

27:45.600 --> 27:47.820
but in terms of being of the way it feels to drive,

27:47.820 --> 27:49.520
the balance, the feel of the steering,

27:49.520 --> 27:51.750
the ride, the little niggles you get in... it hasn't got a

27:51.750 --> 27:53.700
How far can I hit his head?

27:53.700 --> 27:55.550
... fundament like yours have

27:55.550 --> 27:58.600
That's just childish and doesn't solve the argument.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.070
After this, we were asked to leave.

28:03.150 --> 28:05.470
And all we've managed to agree on is

28:05.470 --> 28:08.620
that the Alfa was the least golf clubish.

28:13.369 --> 28:14.818
Thank you, thank you

28:15.539 --> 28:18.182
obviously we will pick that up later on.

28:18.783 --> 28:21.932
but now it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.

28:21.958 --> 28:24.174
My guest tonight is a global megastar

28:24.605 --> 28:26.564
really, he's made his name playing

28:26.564 --> 28:29.137
that kind of dithering English man we all know in love

28:29.146 --> 28:30.851
so I guess it's only a matter of time... uh...

28:31.139 --> 28:34.043
before he's asked to play the lead in "James May: the movie".

28:35.890 --> 28:38.250
Please welcome to this poky motoring show,

28:38.351 --> 28:39.579
Hugh Grant!

28:42.371 --> 28:44.679
- How're you doing
- Hi, good to see you. Very well.

28:44.679 --> 28:46.993
have a seat. Uh... Have a seat.

28:49.321 --> 28:52.225
And um... grateful you've come.

28:53.554 --> 28:54.510
I got to say:

28:55.391 --> 28:56.551
this is thrill for me.

28:57.050 --> 28:57.944
It's a thrill for me.

28:57.952 --> 28:58.640
No, but it really is,

28:58.657 --> 29:00.418
because for the first time ever in the guest interview

29:00.418 --> 29:02.788
- we've got girls all around the front.
- Ah... yes.

29:02.889 --> 29:05.164
'Cause normally at this point they're
all out side talking to Hammond,

29:05.240 --> 29:06.781
but now he's out there all by himself.

29:07.797 --> 29:11.008
So let me start off with cars if I may.

29:11.469 --> 29:12.595
Big hollywood star obviously,

29:12.595 --> 29:14.593
so I presume you've got a Toyota Prius?

29:16.235 --> 29:19.030
You would have thought, you would have thought, um... no,

29:19.291 --> 29:21.899
I have... in my life I've had 2 modes of car,

29:21.932 --> 29:25.159
- Little tiny tossers' cars
- Uh hum.

29:25.210 --> 29:27.909
And great big [beep] cars.

29:29.805 --> 29:31.989
- Um...
- And you're in which mode now?

29:32.222 --> 29:32.874
Do you know,

29:32.993 --> 29:34.669
the first time I'm right in between the 2,

29:34.677 --> 29:37.039
the tossers' cars began with a...

29:37.369 --> 29:41.246
a Citroen Dyane and I don't think you
can get much tossier than that.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.176
Well the great thing about...
No the great thing about the Dyane is

29:43.176 --> 29:45.276
you could crash it and nobody ever knew

29:45.276 --> 29:46.994
'cause there were so many different angles on it

29:47.020 --> 29:48.226
that it was sort of always in...

29:48.594 --> 29:50.144
Yes, yes, I know what you are saying,

29:50.152 --> 29:51.591
also it was... you couldn't hurt anyone

29:51.591 --> 29:53.547
because it had the power of 4 harnessed children

29:53.648 --> 29:54.419
and there is...

29:54.851 --> 29:56.383
And then you got into the kind of

29:56.891 --> 29:59.490
- well you eloquently put it Wankers' cars
- Yeah.

29:59.747 --> 30:01.237
Which started with?

30:02.007 --> 30:04.835
Well it started with um... an Aston Martin Vanquish

30:04.843 --> 30:06.071
which was a beautiful car,

30:06.172 --> 30:07.417
you want to lick it or...

30:09.102 --> 30:10.745
mate with it or something, but

30:11.109 --> 30:12.819
I never really wanted to drive it very much 'cause

30:13.386 --> 30:16.163
the gears did... just occasionally, just when you were feeling

30:16.214 --> 30:18.576
happy in your car would just seize up, the car would stop,

30:19.033 --> 30:20.523
you couldn't even push it to the side of the road,

30:20.523 --> 30:22.681
you're just there on the A316 with people

30:22.681 --> 30:25.011
going past making wanker signs at you.

30:27.992 --> 30:28.923
A lovely car.

30:29.109 --> 30:31.124
Yeah and then it was Bentley, wasn't it?

30:31.125 --> 30:33.062
Then I... yeah I did have a Ben... I had a footballer's car,

30:33.079 --> 30:34.823
Bentley GT Continental um

30:35.001 --> 30:36.796
and very nice again,

30:36.889 --> 30:38.531
but I've got a bad back

30:39.182 --> 30:42.475
and for some reason it manifests
itself some times as back pain

30:42.755 --> 30:44.058
and some times as bollock pain

30:45.972 --> 30:47.106
with the uh...

30:47.418 --> 30:50.335
with the GT Continental, I got terrible bollock pain

30:51.495 --> 30:52.657
some cars seats do it

30:52.657 --> 30:55.577
my brother's Golf GTI was the first one

30:55.967 --> 30:59.706
hence the syndrome is now known as golf ball. Um...

31:01.012 --> 31:04.873
and I got it very badly with the GT Continental
so that had to go back after 6 months.

31:05.025 --> 31:06.202
Because of your testicles?

31:06.261 --> 31:08.242
Yes, I didn't say that to the... um garage.

31:09.325 --> 31:11.687
So um... then what... after the Bentley was?

31:11.983 --> 31:13.338
Then...

31:13.355 --> 31:16.639
I had a beautiful Porsche which I actually phoned you about.

31:16.809 --> 31:19.035
Yeah, well, actually your girlfriend phoned me up

31:19.177 --> 31:20.243
- Yes
- And said listen

31:20.252 --> 31:22.419
- I've got to get Hugh a car
- Yeah

31:22.583 --> 31:24.894
a Porsche...
a Porsche, well that's wrong for a kick-off

31:24.920 --> 31:26.909
- but anyway she was adamant it was going to be a Porsche
- Yeah

31:27.083 --> 31:30.163
And then wanted to know whether it's going
to be an automatic or manual gearbox?

31:30.164 --> 31:31.062
- Yeah.
- So I said automatic.

31:31.062 --> 31:33.024
Yeah, you're absolutely right and of course I got the manual,

31:35.454 --> 31:36.648
and it's so exhuasting...

31:36.665 --> 31:38.654
- 'Cause you want...
- All I wanted was a comfy environment

31:38.654 --> 31:40.948
And a nice arm chair and for my balls not to hurt,

31:42.341 --> 31:43.771
I got... it's not asking much for a car.

31:44.099 --> 31:45.843
And the Porsche also has its interesting thing,

31:45.852 --> 31:49.087
I think it's fine if the steering wheel's
on "ze" left for "ze" Germans

31:49.088 --> 31:51.086
- I see, yeah
- But on the right for the Brits,

31:51.445 --> 31:53.579
something's wrong I think the petrol tank's in the wrong place

31:53.587 --> 31:55.077
so you're facing forward like this

31:55.500 --> 31:58.387
with your upper body and your lower body is here

31:58.396 --> 32:00.343
sort of just looking dile... directly left,

32:00.698 --> 32:01.833
and I found that tricky.

32:01.884 --> 32:04.711
That is tricky, I once had that in a Lancia Stratus

32:04.940 --> 32:08.583
but all... annoyingly in the Lancia
Stratus all of you face this way

32:09.175 --> 32:11.212
while travelling in that... which

32:11.212 --> 32:14.989
it is really does make... it...
the sensation of speed is tremendous

32:15.184 --> 32:16.945
But you'd hit quite often.

32:17.343 --> 32:19.722
Now your driving, how's that?

32:19.950 --> 32:21.246
Do you have road rage?

32:21.748 --> 32:24.068
Terrible rage, yes, and uh...

32:24.567 --> 32:28.777
well yeah, it's road rage that then becomes
terrible road meekness in a flash...

32:28.777 --> 32:30.690
in an instant... there was this guy who

32:30.690 --> 32:33.534
gave me the lightest of knocks,
I mean barely touched the car

32:33.849 --> 32:36.693
and I went into a complete melt down,

32:36.727 --> 32:37.722
um... attacked him

32:37.807 --> 32:39.426
and when he wouldn't get out of his car, I thought

32:39.461 --> 32:41.295
Well I'll attack the car!

32:42.949 --> 32:45.734
And I ripped the wind screen wipers right off his car,

32:45.734 --> 32:46.958
amazed at my own strength,

32:47.280 --> 32:50.006
and he said "You've ripped the
wind screen wipers off my car"

32:50.187 --> 32:52.151
and immediatelly I said "I'm so sorry."

32:53.702 --> 32:56.783
"maybe if I... " I tried to put them back
on, I said "I'll drive you to a garage"

32:56.902 --> 32:59.340
Pathetic... if you're gonna be angry you know, follow it through.

32:59.374 --> 33:01.642
I once told... um someone who is staying...

33:01.677 --> 33:04.714
who had a dog in the hotel next
to um... where I was staying

33:04.765 --> 33:05.985
that kept barking 5 o'clock in the morning,

33:05.985 --> 33:07.247
I got up and then hadn't planned,

33:07.501 --> 33:09.367
this is always the play, if you don't
plan what you're going to say

33:09.367 --> 33:10.311
- all goes wrong
- Yeah.

33:10.633 --> 33:12.668
I got out not sure quite what I was going to say, so I went

33:12.677 --> 33:14.869
"I've killed before!"

33:16.097 --> 33:19.356
My wife was going "What have you
killed before?" Anyway, that's...

33:20.353 --> 33:22.199
Let's talk about films, if we may.

33:22.368 --> 33:23.886
- Your new film
- Yeah.

33:23.958 --> 33:26.396
Ok, is you and Drew Barrymore

33:26.531 --> 33:27.979
- Yes, sir
- And it's called?

33:28.393 --> 33:30.222
- It's called "Music and Lyrics"
- "Music and Lyrics"

33:30.222 --> 33:33.137
Now, I'm sorry about this, we... we never
normally do plugging on the show,

33:33.290 --> 33:35.047
- so I'm not very good at it. We'll try,
- OK

33:35.047 --> 33:37.476
have you got any clips here?
That doesn't work, does it?

33:38.831 --> 33:40.803
We do have a clip, let me just explain what it is, um,

33:40.829 --> 33:43.490
I play this ex-80s pop star, fallen on hard times,

33:43.703 --> 33:46.861
I get this new contract to write
a song for a very famous singer

33:46.861 --> 33:48.342
like it might be Britney Spears,

33:48.486 --> 33:50.726
I write music, I can't find anyone to write lyrics

33:50.726 --> 33:52.461
until I come across this girl

33:52.461 --> 33:54.502
who sometimes waters my plants, Drew Barrymore.

33:54.688 --> 33:56.144
And we write this song together and then

33:56.153 --> 33:59.336
the clip we see here we're just making a little demo tape.

34:01.196 --> 34:02.509
It sounds so good,

34:02.585 --> 34:03.457
I can't believe it.

34:04.642 --> 34:05.260
And now

34:06.678 --> 34:07.347
vocals

34:08.312 --> 34:10.360
no, no you see, you have to sing into the microphone,

34:10.504 --> 34:11.478
it won't follow you.

34:11.976 --> 34:12.722
But I can't.

34:13.052 --> 34:15.696
It's... it's a duet for a man and a woman,
we are as close as we've got,

34:15.942 --> 34:18.145
your head phones and a level,

34:18.178 --> 34:19.862
you look nice in those, you should wear them all the time,

34:20.083 --> 34:22.783
How is... that? Yes?

34:22.960 --> 34:24.806
- Ok.
- Shh... Shh... Shh

34:25.577 --> 34:26.081
It's ok

34:26.868 --> 34:28.002
And...

34:30.804 --> 34:32.303
"Way Back Into Love", take one.

34:33.969 --> 34:36.382
Oh, oh God, I'm getting really nervous.

34:36.382 --> 34:36.927
You'll be fine, you'll...

34:36.927 --> 34:39.116
just use your normal nice voice that I've heard

34:39.116 --> 34:40.754
so much of in the last 3 days.

34:40.905 --> 34:44.467
It's like my throat's closing up, it's like anaphylactic

34:44.594 --> 34:46.081
It's fine, just a 3 minute song

34:51.318 --> 34:55.725
(SINGING)"I've been living with the shadow overhead,"

34:56.004 --> 34:57.460
(SINGING)"I've been sleeping with the... "

34:57.460 --> 35:00.127
Just uh... a little bit louder 'cause this
song is intended for humans ok?

35:03.362 --> 35:04.259
Very good.

35:08.379 --> 35:09.112
Do you think?

35:12.575 --> 35:13.760
It's a romantic comedy, Jeremy,

35:13.768 --> 35:15.695
which is something I've never done before, so um

35:17.278 --> 35:18.820
I'd like to stretch myself as an actor,

35:18.820 --> 35:20.479
it's all about discovery, isn't it? Reacting,

35:20.479 --> 35:21.555
trying new stuff.

35:21.967 --> 35:24.820
And it's a um... I think a lovely funny film

35:24.913 --> 35:27.190
Its open's on um..on the 9th of February.

35:27.334 --> 35:28.822
Em... can I just talk... ok,

35:28.822 --> 35:31.114
you're... we're the same age, give or take, I think...

35:31.114 --> 35:32.900
- It's hard to believe to look at it, isn't it?
- Yeah.

35:33.561 --> 35:34.945
Frankly it is, yeah.

35:35.385 --> 35:37.273
Are you starting to fall to pieces yet?

35:37.493 --> 35:39.935
- Yes I am, yes I am , Jeremy. Yes.
- Are you?

35:40.189 --> 35:42.221
Uh... worst bit for me,

35:42.727 --> 35:44.547
is when you're...

35:44.631 --> 35:47.552
you've wash... you've shaved,
you're rinsing your face like this,

35:47.967 --> 35:49.806
and then you look up into the mirror,

35:49.806 --> 35:51.136
I've got a mirror to the side here.

35:51.356 --> 35:54.009
My eyes look up but my face is still pointing down.

35:55.634 --> 35:56.447
- That's...
- That's how.

35:56.447 --> 35:58.657
And also didn't you have some trouble with your bottom?

36:00.181 --> 36:01.653
That was a terrible moment, yeah,

36:01.661 --> 36:03.769
that was a really terrible... I... I...

36:03.845 --> 36:05.884
funnily enough that was for "golf ball", it was.

36:05.909 --> 36:07.806
I went to see a doctor in Harley Street,

36:08.525 --> 36:11.036
and I... it was suspicious of him
to begin with 'cause he said uh...

36:11.299 --> 36:13.204
"Very good if you'd just like to sit, pull all your clothes off?"

36:13.238 --> 36:14.689
So I... I took them all off,

36:14.884 --> 36:16.755
and then he interviewed me. I sat...

36:19.254 --> 36:21.920
I sat naked as a baby

36:21.929 --> 36:25.349
in front of him like this in a... in a very
expensive big consultation room

36:25.349 --> 36:28.181
while he wrote down things about me, kept
looking at me and writing all the things down.

36:28.528 --> 36:31.791
And then he said "Right, we're just going to
uh... do a quick uh... prostate examination."

36:32.434 --> 36:33.206
Bent me over,

36:33.723 --> 36:36.373
and I swear to God, stuck his head up my bottom,

36:38.180 --> 36:41.482
because when he said "Does that hurt?"

36:41.490 --> 36:43.573
it was muffled, it was "Does that hurt?"

36:46.160 --> 36:48.116
And it was the worst pain I've ever had in my life.

36:48.455 --> 36:51.604
Ok listen, I really want to get onto your lap, obviously.

36:51.900 --> 36:53.001
- Yes.
- How did it go out there?

36:53.669 --> 36:55.331
I thought quite badly, um...

36:55.898 --> 36:58.337
I like the Stig very much, he was very kind to me

36:58.506 --> 37:02.383
um... but uh... it's not easy, it's not easy Jeremy.

37:02.417 --> 37:04.025
- You don't think so.
- No, I don't.

37:04.025 --> 37:05.761
'cause it's so counter-intuitive,

37:05.854 --> 37:06.956
you know? Just when you're thinking:

37:06.956 --> 37:09.004
Well now I'm going to die so I'll brake

37:09.029 --> 37:11.027
but he says "Flat down with the accelerator!"

37:11.314 --> 37:13.454
And uh... and the other way around and um...

37:13.454 --> 37:15.309
I... I know I'm gonna be bad.

37:15.409 --> 37:18.023
Who here would like to see Hugh's lap?

37:18.302 --> 37:21.326
(Crowd) Yeah!
- Let's play the tape, here it goes.

37:21.910 --> 37:22.554
This is you

37:23.341 --> 37:24.375
and there you go.

37:26.466 --> 37:27.372
What a car.

37:28.455 --> 37:30.494
- That's...
- A very unattractive helmet.

37:30.943 --> 37:33.635
Oh, don't change gear, you [beep]!

37:35.769 --> 37:38.190
- Crikey Moses!
- That can not be my best...

37:40.908 --> 37:41.755
that's quite grown up.

37:41.755 --> 37:43.634
That was very good through there, excellent.

37:43.635 --> 37:45.365
- Oh where are you going now though? Yeah.
- That's...

37:46.445 --> 37:47.579
Hammerhead

37:47.994 --> 37:50.271
- looking smooth and fast
- I never mastered the Hammerhead

37:50.779 --> 37:52.337
- Is that a penalty?
- That's good, no that's good.

37:53.057 --> 37:53.936
Good line through there.

37:54.233 --> 37:56.036
Oh that was a piece of "art"

37:57.009 --> 37:58.635
Oh [beep]

37:59.253 --> 38:02.229
Soon you're gonna cut inside and you won't be swearing.

38:02.229 --> 38:03.347
Is it gonna be fast through here?

38:03.347 --> 38:05.269
See? Every time I came wobbling through a turn

38:05.379 --> 38:08.062
there was another ex-BBC camera man right in my way.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.390
Did exactly the wrong thing again.

38:11.491 --> 38:12.845
And here we are, last corner

38:13.134 --> 38:14.506
- This is very poor
- That's going wide

38:14.507 --> 38:17.481
that's wow yes! Across the line!

38:18.531 --> 38:18.937
Now

38:25.612 --> 38:26.442
I um...

38:28.262 --> 38:31.318
I know it's not good, I know, I feel...
I feel like I've let anyone... everyone down

38:31.377 --> 38:32.933
- and including the Stig.
- No, what do you mean? It's only yourself.

38:34.499 --> 38:36.912
So where do you think you've come on the um...

38:37.005 --> 38:38.356
- on the board?
- Ah, I wish I knew.

38:38.356 --> 38:40.653
Who would I really like... I wouldn't like to come lower

38:41.415 --> 38:43.455
than Michael Gambon.

38:43.616 --> 38:45.715
- Michael Gambon? You've beat him.
- Yeah.

38:46.069 --> 38:49.684
Oh that's good. In that case, I... I quite
like to beat you and McGregor.

38:49.874 --> 38:53.556
- Well, you actually did it in 1 minute
- Yes.

38:53.852 --> 38:55.833
- Forty
- Yes

38:57.052 --> 38:59.614
- Seven... Point seven
- Yes

38:59.640 --> 39:02.276
- Oh hello.
- Congratulations!

39:09.392 --> 39:10.544
You're right up there.

39:11.543 --> 39:13.651
You're in fact only emm..

39:14.158 --> 39:16.808
point one of a second behind the well spoken man.

39:16.884 --> 39:18.141
Yes, yes.

39:18.141 --> 39:19.479
Anyway, so there you are, uh...

39:19.479 --> 39:22.422
Ah sorry but Jamie Oliver was in the
snow, so he moves up, is that right?

39:22.422 --> 39:25.248
No he wasn't, it had melted, he did melted snow

39:25.265 --> 39:27.434
- He claims it was snow, and we punished him for that
- Yes

39:27.849 --> 39:29.518
So no, I... I think you're better

39:29.721 --> 39:32.752
and funnier and much better looking with a smaller tongue.

39:35.187 --> 39:37.016
Ladies and gentlemen, Hugh Grant!

39:45.220 --> 39:50.300
Right, now, earlier, we were testing three
coupes to decide which one is best.

39:50.300 --> 39:53.650
I really really like this Alfa Romeo Brera.

39:53.650 --> 39:57.550
Clarkson stupidly prefers this new Audi TT

39:57.550 --> 40:01.950
and the damn fool Hammond seems to
think it should be this Mazda RX-8.

40:01.950 --> 40:05.470
And so far, we have established pretty much nothing.

40:05.470 --> 40:06.870
But now in the second part of the film

40:06.870 --> 40:09.820
we drive into Edinburgh and still arguing.

40:19.350 --> 40:22.300
Can you set the sat nav in your car, OK?

40:22.870 --> 40:25.370
Err, no, I haven't got sat nav.

40:25.370 --> 40:26.920
Could you do that, Richard?

40:26.920 --> 40:29.200
I go by instinct in here.

40:29.850 --> 40:33.920
So it's the driver's car, or the navigator's car.

40:33.920 --> 40:36.370
or the air hostess's in the case of yours Jeremy

40:36.370 --> 40:38.820
Think it with a bit of dust on my headlamps,

40:38.820 --> 40:40.750
so I will just wash that off.

40:40.750 --> 40:42.850
Yes, I've done that with my headlamp washers.

40:42.850 --> 40:44.300
Have you done that, James?

40:44.300 --> 40:47.500
Well I did that earlier with a wet hanky and end of my finger.

40:47.500 --> 40:50.550
But either of you two got a DSG gearbox.

40:50.550 --> 40:51.920
- No. - No.

40:51.920 --> 40:54.850
Have you got adjustable suspension, either of you?

40:54.850 --> 40:56.470
- No. - No.

40:58.220 --> 41:00.600
But then I fired a torpedo

41:00.600 --> 41:03.420
straight into the side of HMS Clarkson.

41:03.420 --> 41:07.400
Jeremy, can I just ask how much of that stuff is standard.

41:07.400 --> 41:11.620
Almost everything really is an optional extra.

41:12.350 --> 41:14.470
How many is that lot cost?

41:14.470 --> 41:19.070
Err, the optional extras on this car add up 2000 pounds.

41:19.070 --> 41:20.200
How much?

41:20.200 --> 41:23.100
Six (more) thousand pounds.

41:23.100 --> 41:24.800
Six grand?

41:24.800 --> 41:27.670
It's actually eight grand but shh...

41:29.150 --> 41:33.500
It was tit for tat all the way and nobody was going to give in.

41:33.870 --> 41:35.700
The truth of the matter is this

41:35.700 --> 41:37.170
the car you really want

41:37.170 --> 41:38.620
looks like the Alfa

41:38.620 --> 41:39.970
drives like the Mazda

41:39.970 --> 41:41.220
and is built like the Audi.

41:41.220 --> 41:42.800
But since that doesn't exist

41:42.800 --> 41:44.270
you've got to have the Audi.

41:44.270 --> 41:47.050
Cause it's the best all round of the best compromise

41:47.050 --> 41:49.570
and that, that's an end of it.

41:50.120 --> 41:53.670
It wasn't the end though,
because coupes are all about looks.

41:53.670 --> 41:56.750
And to find out which of ours was the best looking

41:58.870 --> 42:03.770
we've been told to go to the Scottish National
Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh.

42:05.420 --> 42:07.050
The challenge was simple,

42:07.050 --> 42:10.850
if this prestigious gallery was to accept just one of our cars

42:10.850 --> 42:15.150
based on styling and love, which would it be?

42:15.650 --> 42:19.270
A panel of experts have been assembled to make the choice.

42:21.370 --> 42:22.900
And to help things along,

42:22.900 --> 42:27.900
we'd each been given two minutes to argue
the artistic merits of our particular car.

42:28.450 --> 42:29.920
But before that,

42:30.400 --> 42:34.170
five minutes in the gallery bookshop to bone up our art bit.

42:34.370 --> 42:36.120
Is there anything Japanese at all?

42:36.120 --> 42:37.050
Scottish arts...

42:37.050 --> 42:42.720
You have like a single volume on the
artistic influence of Alfa Romeo coupes.

42:43.750 --> 42:47.320
Err, Japanese culture in general maybe like into an oyster.

42:47.320 --> 42:51.750
Opening itself up to repeat the onslaughts from the... oyster.

42:54.550 --> 42:59.270
Unfortunately the crash course in the bookshop
just confused us even more.

42:59.270 --> 43:02.970
As the experts discovered when James kicked things off.

43:03.500 --> 43:05.600
Em, good afternoon professors.

43:05.600 --> 43:07.600
I'd like to begin by asking the question

43:07.600 --> 43:09.900
Can a car be a piece of art.

43:09.900 --> 43:12.350
I'd like to say immediately that I think no.

43:12.350 --> 43:14.120
That's not a piece of art

43:14.120 --> 43:18.250
but can we find any art in that piece of design?

43:18.250 --> 43:19.520
I'll put it down there.

43:19.520 --> 43:23.070
Can I really argue that the Audi TT was a reaction

43:23.070 --> 43:27.150
to the overly complicated ceiling rose of Victorian houses?

43:28.200 --> 43:31.650
For example we can see in the lights of the Alfa Romeo here

43:31.650 --> 43:34.400
I think the influence of the Scottish colorists,

43:34.400 --> 43:36.370
namely Fergusson and Peploe

43:36.370 --> 43:39.170
You went to art school, you should be good at this.

43:39.550 --> 43:40.570
Did you go to art school?

43:40.570 --> 43:41.320
No, I didn't.

43:41.320 --> 43:42.600
Then you wouldn't know what you do in art school

43:42.600 --> 43:44.250
is drink and pursuing women.

43:44.250 --> 43:46.470
All arts I believe should be about two things,

43:46.470 --> 43:47.950
truth and beauty.

43:47.950 --> 43:50.300
Now, it's true because it's real.

43:50.300 --> 43:51.850
It's not actually a piece of art.

43:52.700 --> 43:54.770
How do we shut this man up?

43:54.820 --> 43:57.220
Do you know what? We've made amphibious cars,

43:57.220 --> 43:59.200
we've made a convertible people carrier,

43:59.200 --> 44:01.050
I've raced you to Oslo

44:01.050 --> 44:03.650
This is the hardest thing I've ever faced.

44:03.650 --> 44:05.850
He's given the impression that he's taken

44:05.850 --> 44:09.150
his brush oil, even his calligraphy pen,
the impression he has given...

44:09.150 --> 44:11.400
I think we've probably heard enough,

44:11.400 --> 44:14.320
That's alright with you, thank you very much.

44:14.320 --> 44:16.870
I'll... I did want to talk about the renaissance
and the meaning of truth

44:16.870 --> 44:19.570
-  and the development of human thought
- We could leave that for another day.

44:19.570 --> 44:23.070
These trousers are not Bauhaus.

44:24.120 --> 44:25.900
Hahaha

44:26.420 --> 44:28.720
Why we mates look a bit like a monkey?

44:28.720 --> 44:30.220
Their brains are big.

44:30.220 --> 44:33.900
Justify why you think your car should be in this gallery.

44:33.900 --> 44:38.650
Um, one can see influences of the Bauhaus thinking

44:38.650 --> 44:41.250
in so many of the things around us today,

44:41.250 --> 44:42.500
some of the design classic.

44:42.500 --> 44:48.370
Um Mart Stam's cantilever chair and
the Marcel Breuer "Wassily" chair.

44:48.370 --> 44:49.920
Why is he talking about chairs?

44:49.920 --> 44:52.870
It looks like it's going somewhere, it looks purposeful,

44:52.870 --> 44:54.800
I mean if you compare it, for example,

44:54.800 --> 44:56.520
that's the inside of the Mazda,

44:56.520 --> 44:58.700
that's not Bauhaus.

44:58.970 --> 45:00.770
That's my trousers...

45:01.100 --> 45:03.050
Woo, look, I found Jeremy's notes,

45:03.050 --> 45:05.470
trousers, fat, Hitler,

45:05.470 --> 45:07.600
tiger, Mazda, Alfa,

45:07.600 --> 45:09.220
modernism, minimalism

45:09.220 --> 45:10.520
... minimalism, modernism

45:10.520 --> 45:14.170
I think it created cubism, I think it created
Picasso, no, not that one

45:14.170 --> 45:16.920
Cubism came about 10 or 15 year earlier, but go on...

45:18.770 --> 45:21.470
I don't think that... I think the Audi is Bauhaus...

45:21.470 --> 45:27.020
But I think it's got a very contemporary veneer.

45:27.020 --> 45:29.420
I mean one shouldn't hang the whole item on the Bauhaus,

45:29.420 --> 45:30.250
I don't think it's

45:30.250 --> 45:33.370
"Das ist einfach nicht wahr" as they would say in the Bauhaus

45:33.370 --> 45:34.600
It's just not true.

45:36.900 --> 45:38.300
What does it symbolize?

45:38.750 --> 45:43.870
The Audi symbolizes freedom?

45:44.370 --> 45:46.100
Freedom! Like that. (Brave Heart)

45:53.200 --> 45:54.820
Warm in there, isn't it?

45:56.470 --> 45:58.420
Err, gentlemen,

45:58.420 --> 46:03.900
God is the reason why you might
look at this car the Mazda RX-8.

46:03.900 --> 46:07.750
And see there's something a bit unusual.

46:07.750 --> 46:10.350
The Mazda is a Japanese car.

46:10.350 --> 46:12.150
In understanding a little bit about

46:12.150 --> 46:15.570
why this car is different to ours.

46:15.570 --> 46:18.650
And you can see that express through
out Japanese culture and paintings,

46:18.650 --> 46:19.420
If you to take

46:19.420 --> 46:21.146
We are just gonna see you put your hands in your pocket

46:21.146 --> 46:22.600
'cause you're sort of refering to note here.

46:22.600 --> 46:23.650
I can... I can do that.

46:23.650 --> 46:28.270
Em, if you refer to "Catching Catfish with a Gourd",

46:28.270 --> 46:32.120
from the 15th century by Josetsu

46:32.120 --> 46:36.520
One of the blokes over there is an expert on
Japanese and oriental art, you know that

46:36.520 --> 46:39.470
Can you just reiterate some of those points?

46:39.470 --> 46:40.420
Which point?

46:40.420 --> 46:41.750
The ones you just made.

46:42.050 --> 46:44.120
Did you feel a bit thick when you finished doing it?

46:44.120 --> 46:44.720
Thick?

46:44.720 --> 46:46.120
How do you think he is gonna feel?

46:46.120 --> 46:47.220
He'll probably punch one of them...

46:47.220 --> 46:50.350
I've eaten brighter vegetables than he is.

46:50.350 --> 46:52.270
You put this car in the gallery...

46:52.270 --> 46:52.970
Yeah

46:52.970 --> 46:55.720
What else are you going to have in
the environment that surround it?

46:55.720 --> 46:59.170
Maybe to extend it further.. Maybe to have
some other Japanese stuff in there.

46:59.170 --> 47:01.300
Do you have any examples, that you think would be

47:01.300 --> 47:02.950
or value for the potential visitors?

47:02.950 --> 47:04.750
Some paint. Japanese paintings.

47:04.750 --> 47:07.550
By anyone particular?

47:08.120 --> 47:13.750
That would be for, perhaps, you know, specialists to choose.

47:15.520 --> 47:17.150
How did that go?

47:17.150 --> 47:20.050
I think well, I think well, err

47:20.050 --> 47:21.120
Do you know you're bright red.

47:21.120 --> 47:22.920
Yeah, I'm hot, very hot.

47:24.570 --> 47:29.400
The boffins conferred and then called
us all in to give their verdicts.

47:30.670 --> 47:32.720
I think the Audi is err

47:32.720 --> 47:35.250
you know sort of constrained, it's modest,

47:35.250 --> 47:36.700
it's sort of tidy.

47:36.700 --> 47:39.070
But it's not saying, doesn't say very much to me.

47:39.070 --> 47:41.620
You know, this lessness is less for me not more.

47:41.620 --> 47:44.770
Err, I'm most persuaded by the Alfa.

47:44.770 --> 47:46.750
I agree entirely, yes.

47:46.750 --> 47:51.370
The Mazda, I looked at it from various angles.

47:51.750 --> 47:54.600
And it just doesn't seem to be as clear cut as

47:54.600 --> 47:59.500
an expression of what the modern art motif
coupe is. And I think that's the Alfa.

48:00.170 --> 48:05.270
In terms of the look, the style, everything that it denotes

48:05.270 --> 48:09.620
we'd be happy to show that car
in this gallery, the Alfa Romeo.

48:09.620 --> 48:10.620
Well it's alright.

48:10.620 --> 48:12.620
- /
- Cause it'll just break down before it got here.

48:12.620 --> 48:15.520
- /
- You get oil all over your nice floor.

48:15.520 --> 48:18.670
Come on, you can stop being petty and infantile.

48:18.670 --> 48:21.650
These three men are experts in art and artistic expression...

48:21.650 --> 48:25.300
- Well, they are wrong.
- It's only 'cause I've said freedom. That's what we...

48:28.900 --> 48:31.600
Well, rubbish.

48:32.820 --> 48:35.070
As Richard said: They were wrong.

48:35.070 --> 48:37.800
So now we're gonna do a much more important test

48:37.800 --> 48:40.320
which is the fastest around our track?

48:40.320 --> 48:41.720
Now obviously to find that out,

48:41.720 --> 48:44.450
we have to hand them over to our tame racing driver.

48:44.950 --> 48:49.120
Some say that he once had a vicious
knife fight with Anthea Turner

48:50.170 --> 48:54.070
and that he is in no way implicated
in the "Cash for Honours' Scandal"

48:54.270 --> 48:57.650
All we know is, he's called Lord Stig.

49:00.170 --> 49:02.220
Well that has wasted about an hour with wheel spin.

49:02.220 --> 49:04.220
Get off, he started off in the best car.

49:04.220 --> 49:06.700
The only proper sports car, of course the Mazda.

49:06.700 --> 49:07.950
Rear wheel drive of course,

49:07.950 --> 49:10.070
this is familiar to him, it feels like a sports car

49:10.070 --> 49:11.770
'cause it was designed as a sports car.

49:11.770 --> 49:12.900
<i>Radio: Lucy looked at him,</i>

49:12.900 --> 49:16.250
<i>the strong, kind face and the endearing look in his eyes,</i>

49:16.250 --> 49:18.400
<i>and she opened her heart to him.</i>

49:18.400 --> 49:20.870
Now you see, this romantic fiction, he's into it now.

49:20.870 --> 49:22.470
Right over... oh look at that, you see,

49:22.470 --> 49:25.300
- it's so controllable, you can steer it with the rear end.
- Is it moving? Is it moving?

49:25.300 --> 49:26.620
Rubbish, it's fast, mate.

49:26.620 --> 49:28.050
Don't ignore.  Here we go , hammerhead.

49:28.050 --> 49:29.400
- Oh
- Look at that.

49:29.400 --> 49:30.600
No, no, that's miles off.

49:30.600 --> 49:32.450
That is elegant and controlled.

49:32.450 --> 49:34.570
That really is. He'll be enjoying that in there,

49:34.570 --> 49:36.670
- that's familiar territory for him.
- 40?

49:36.670 --> 49:39.020
And it looks at home on the track unlike the other two.

49:39.020 --> 49:40.070
He'll have to lift off then.

49:40.070 --> 49:42.970
- It's not for... Oh, look at that.
- 45

49:42.970 --> 49:46.270
- Braking, oh he'll be around here in a minute.
- Now he's got 1 corner and the final corner,

49:46.270 --> 49:49.420
- under control and looking like a proper fast car
- Look at... chintzy styling

49:49.420 --> 49:52.570
- He's lost it, that's all... very bad.
- Oh, what a spectacle.

49:54.020 --> 49:54.950
Still there,

49:54.950 --> 49:57.900
No, good front end grip, good balance, excellent brakes,

49:57.900 --> 49:59.750
Oh ho ho, did you see that dive?

49:59.750 --> 50:02.170
Wow, it's like watching the actual studio going around, isn't it?

50:02.170 --> 50:04.400
-That's balance and poise.
- It's boring.

50:04.400 --> 50:06.920
I suppose you're gonna tell us
it's the most practical car, James?

50:06.920 --> 50:08.070
Well actually it is, you see.

50:08.070 --> 50:09.400
Because you can get 2 people in the front,

50:09.400 --> 50:11.820
2 in the back and a set of golf bats in the boot,

50:11.820 --> 50:12.500
I checked that.

50:12.500 --> 50:13.820
Oh very useful.

50:13.820 --> 50:14.770
And it goes off the road...

50:14.770 --> 50:17.170
You know it's no good for golf 'cause it's the least Pringly

50:17.170 --> 50:19.120
and now you're telling this's got golf rackets in it.

50:19.120 --> 50:21.500
- Look at that
- It's... It's not turned at all there, it understeered...

50:21.500 --> 50:23.750
Look at this, really, I¡¯ve never seen a car oversteer...

50:23.750 --> 50:25.200
He's using all the track,

50:25.200 --> 50:27.350
- that's what...
- He needs all the track, that's different.

50:27.350 --> 50:31.650
It hasn't let... no, here we go,
it'll just crash now, no, that was...

50:31.650 --> 50:32.500
Beautiful.

50:32.500 --> 50:33.970
Here we go, he's understeered...

50:33.970 --> 50:36.470
- well, no he's got it in... yes
-Very neat, clip the apex.

50:36.470 --> 50:38.950
- And here
- Steering accurately
- Out of control

50:38.950 --> 50:41.750
We got oil coming out of the bottom, right, gentlemen,

50:41.750 --> 50:43.650
behold the magnificent.

50:43.650 --> 50:45.300
Oh you're off to the hair dresser, sir?

50:45.300 --> 50:47.300
- Get off!
- Hahaha.

50:47.300 --> 50:48.650
Oh would you like any bred items?

50:48.650 --> 50:50.970
I know you're thinking this is the old TT,

50:50.970 --> 50:51.900
don't muddle them up,

50:51.900 --> 50:54.120
that was for air hostesses, people who are orange.

50:54.120 --> 50:56.550
This is the new one, it's a completely different animal,

50:56.550 --> 50:59.620
this remember it's only the front wheel drive one, the baby one, look at it.

50:59.620 --> 51:01.500
Front wheel drive, unlike a sports car,

51:01.500 --> 51:02.620
which would have rear wheel drive.

51:02.620 --> 51:03.770
Oh you just saw the back coming round there,

51:03.770 --> 51:05.400
- it's got a little bit of left off over steer.
- A little bit

51:05.400 --> 51:07.470
I saw it, I saw the front nod.

51:07.470 --> 51:08.650
Here we go, just watch this,

51:08.650 --> 51:10.720
look at this, compare to your one James?

51:10.720 --> 51:12.070
- It's worse.
- Boy, that was so slow!

51:12.070 --> 51:13.370
It's not worse.

51:13.370 --> 51:15.650
It is worse, look, it's on the grass, it's almost on the grass.

51:15.650 --> 51:18.600
The... right... honestly, this is a completely different animal

51:18.600 --> 51:20.520
than the one we used to have.

51:20.520 --> 51:23.600
- This is fast. Yes.
- No.

51:23.600 --> 51:25.470
Only the 2 Liter one, remember?

51:25.470 --> 51:26.470
- Just the baby.
- Miles out.

51:26.470 --> 51:28.820
The V6 actually is nowhere near as good as this.

51:28.820 --> 51:30.600
As we come up to the final corner.

51:30.600 --> 51:32.350
It's going to under steer off and crash.

51:32.350 --> 51:33.300
Oh, it's done it, it's off the road.

51:33.300 --> 51:34.620
It's just airborne.

51:35.100 --> 51:38.570
Right, ready?

51:38.570 --> 51:39.670
Time for the Audi

51:39.670 --> 51:41.820
1:31.4, check it out.

51:41.820 --> 51:43.400
I wouldn't... I wouldn't be so confident,

51:43.400 --> 51:46.400
because you see my car, I think on a race track,

51:46.400 --> 51:47.720
you'll find that...

51:47.720 --> 51:51.500
Hahaha, five seconds.

51:51.500 --> 51:54.350
Listen, you can stop being quite so cocky about it

51:54.350 --> 51:57.070
because your Audi hasn't won anything yet.

51:57.070 --> 52:00.650
Remember how it's been? It's not the
best looking, it's the most expensive.

52:00.650 --> 52:01.770
It's not the most practical.

52:01.770 --> 52:04.220
Exactly and we're about to find out
that it isn't the fastest either

52:04.220 --> 52:05.800
when my Mazda beats it.

52:05.800 --> 52:06.650
Hah! Oh...

52:08.350 --> 52:09.150
Damn...

52:09.150 --> 52:10.400
No, no, no you've won.

52:10.400 --> 52:11.520
I've lost.

52:11.520 --> 52:13.650
No 'cause I'm gonna own up now.

52:13.650 --> 52:16.150
Secretly all along I¡¯ve preferred the Alfa.

52:16.150 --> 52:17.120
What?

52:17.120 --> 52:20.320
No, I just know, I... seriously, I just... if it were my money,

52:20.320 --> 52:21.900
that's what I¡¯d buy,

52:21.900 --> 52:24.170
and I¡¯ll bet you any money it's the same for you.

52:24.170 --> 52:24.900
Yeah.

52:24.900 --> 52:26.850
Yes, I knew it, I knew it.

52:26.850 --> 52:28.920
But, I'm sorry before you get too cocky,

52:28.920 --> 52:32.050
I would not recommend one to a friend.

52:32.050 --> 52:34.270
That's the thing, 'cause you... well you wouldn't,

52:34.270 --> 52:35.320
you can't say ¡°Yes, go and buy an Alfa"

52:35.320 --> 52:36.850
'Cause then they'll spend the rest of their life in a car

52:36.850 --> 52:38.370
that just stays on the side of the motorway.

52:38.370 --> 52:40.370
So I can't recommend one to a friend. Could you?

52:40.370 --> 52:42.150
No, I wouldn't recommend one, no.

52:42.150 --> 52:44.950
- E... E... would you?
- Come on.

52:44.950 --> 52:45.620
No, alright.

52:45.620 --> 52:46.950
There you are, you see? You wouldn't.

52:46.950 --> 52:49.120
So what we've managed to establish is

52:49.120 --> 52:52.820
the best car here is the worst!

52:52.820 --> 52:54.570
Yeah, wow we're good at this.

52:54.570 --> 52:55.170
We are.

52:55.170 --> 52:56.270
And that's the end of the show,

52:56.270 --> 52:57.420
thank you very much for watching,

52:57.420 --> 52:59.400
next week we've got a top gear special

52:59.400 --> 53:01.043
see you then, good night.
