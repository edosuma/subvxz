00:01.262 --> 00:02.480
Previously on
Supergirl...

00:02.524 --> 00:04.091
My brother was a traitor.

00:04.134 --> 00:05.396
He poisoned us.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.355
Perhaps if I can access
more of my memories,

00:07.398 --> 00:09.748
I might be able to uncover
what his next move will be.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.185
Kelly, do you think
we can go deeper

00:11.228 --> 00:12.664
with Obsidian's tech?

00:12.708 --> 00:14.710
That kind of power
could re-set your brain
for good.

00:17.104 --> 00:20.629
The power to incept
was stolen from me
in the Phantom Zone.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.631
That woman gave you the answer.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.329
Eve, meet Hope.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.331
You two are going to be working
closely together.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.682
I see you.
You're a saboteur.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.771
That's a rotten way
of making it to the top.

00:45.871 --> 00:46.742
Hey, Jarrod.

00:47.873 --> 00:49.658
Blowing me off
was not a smart move.

00:49.701 --> 00:52.922
Was I unclear
the first 12 times?

00:52.965 --> 00:54.358
I'm not interested.

00:54.402 --> 00:57.100
If you don't work with us,
this will end very badly.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.667
You're going with threats?

00:58.710 --> 01:00.234
You should see
what my board
threatens me with

01:00.277 --> 01:01.583
every other Tuesday.

01:02.410 --> 01:04.367
You're making a mistake.

01:33.528 --> 01:34.790
Thanks, Jenny.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.357
The next time your sister
asks you to babysit,

01:36.400 --> 01:37.401
just say no.

01:37.445 --> 01:39.055
Remember, boundaries.

01:40.752 --> 01:43.407
Speaking of boundaries,
do you even know that woman?

01:43.451 --> 01:44.582
I just met her, why?

01:44.626 --> 01:46.628
She just told you
her whole life story?

01:46.671 --> 01:48.412
It's kind of my job
to listen, guys.

01:48.456 --> 01:51.328
Kelly, you were attacked
by a shapeshifter.

01:51.372 --> 01:52.721
And he's still out there.

01:52.764 --> 01:56.116
And you have every DEO agent
working to find him.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.334
I don't think it could hurt

01:57.378 --> 01:59.510
to reel it in
just until they catch him.

01:59.554 --> 02:01.208
And as Alex's sister,

02:01.251 --> 02:03.862
I can tell you
that she's almost always
annoyingly right.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.647
And as Kelly's brother,
I can tell you

02:05.690 --> 02:06.822
that she can handle herself.

02:08.389 --> 02:10.608
Listen, I hate to break up
this Danvers-Olsen scrimmage,

02:10.651 --> 02:12.697
but we have to get
to our meeting.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.873
- All right.
-Try not to worry so much.

02:15.961 --> 02:16.962
-Okay.
-Okay.

02:17.006 --> 02:18.399
-Bye.
-Bye.

02:20.314 --> 02:21.880
Any sign of Malefic?

02:21.924 --> 02:24.448
No. He doesn't seem to have
any psychic signature either.

02:24.492 --> 02:26.146
But we'll find him.
We have to.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.019
Oh! You... You all right?

02:31.716 --> 02:34.763
Maybe I'm a little nervous
about having lunch with Lena.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.112
It's the first time
we're hanging out

02:36.156 --> 02:37.461
since I told her
I was Supergirl.

02:37.505 --> 02:40.116
I was just
lying to her for so long.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.987
Kara, Lena forgave you.

02:42.031 --> 02:44.599
Okay? So you're going to have
to just let go of the past.

02:44.642 --> 02:46.818
I just want things
to be great between us.

02:46.862 --> 02:49.299
I... And I want
this lunch to be--

02:49.343 --> 02:50.213
Perfect.

02:50.257 --> 02:51.171
Yes.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.215
And it will.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.303
Look, Lena wants
your relationship

02:53.347 --> 02:55.218
back on track, too.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.177
Look, I have to get back
to the DEO.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.657
You go be perfect
somewhere else.

02:59.701 --> 03:00.354
I'll try.

03:00.397 --> 03:01.485
Okay.

03:10.973 --> 03:11.843
Damn it!

03:14.716 --> 03:17.371
The transmitter you duplicated
from the Obsidian contacts

03:17.414 --> 03:19.329
uses an ocular interface.

03:19.373 --> 03:21.505
Since you modeled it
directly into the brain,

03:21.549 --> 03:23.290
may I suggest
you lower the frequency

03:23.333 --> 03:25.205
another 7.32%?

03:25.248 --> 03:26.249
It's not that, Hope.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.685
In theory,
Q-waves should allow me

03:27.729 --> 03:29.731
to rewrite portions
of the human brain.

03:29.774 --> 03:32.081
To rid the world of lying,
manipulation and violence.

03:32.124 --> 03:34.518
Yes, but no matter
how I manipulate the frequency,

03:34.562 --> 03:35.998
the transmitter
will only allow me

03:36.041 --> 03:38.087
to read information
from the brain.

03:38.130 --> 03:40.437
If I try to augment it,
I get a zombie effect.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.352
And you don't want
a world of robots.

03:42.396 --> 03:43.701
You just want better people.

03:43.745 --> 03:44.659
Right.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.495
I am sorry, Ms. Luthor.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.323
It must be uncomfortable,

03:56.366 --> 03:58.499
with me in this form,
for you to trust me.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.284
I don't trust people, Hope.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.590
I believed I could once.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.896
I had friends
that made me believe I could.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.116
But they betrayed me
like everyone else.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.422
Your brother, Lex,

04:08.465 --> 04:09.553
was the worst of them.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.425
But I believe
he could help you now.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.557
I have access to
Eve Tessmacher's memories.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.429
Lex was working with Q-waves.

04:15.472 --> 04:16.690
It was part of his plan

04:16.733 --> 04:19.084
to get past
Superman's invulnerable skin.

04:19.128 --> 04:21.826
He left detailed records
in his private journals.

04:22.436 --> 04:23.437
His journals?

04:23.480 --> 04:24.568
There are three of them.

04:24.612 --> 04:25.961
They are currently

04:26.004 --> 04:29.094
in a level five secure facility
at Fort Summit.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.621
However, upon further analysis,

04:33.664 --> 04:35.449
retrieving them
would be impossible.

04:40.323 --> 04:41.846
For me, maybe, but...

04:42.673 --> 04:44.153
not for everyone.

04:47.635 --> 04:50.594
Graceful arcs across her brow

04:50.638 --> 04:53.771
I'm left forever to wonder how

04:53.815 --> 04:56.948
A being as perfect
as my Nia Nal

04:57.558 --> 04:58.776
Could ever love

04:58.820 --> 05:00.082
-Someone as small...
-Put up with this all.

05:02.127 --> 05:02.954
What was that?

05:02.998 --> 05:04.782
Um, just thank you

05:04.826 --> 05:07.611
for poem one hundred and--

05:07.655 --> 05:08.830
One hundred and twenty-seven.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.658
One hundred and twenty-seven.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.616
Yes, I've almost
mastered the sonnet.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.792
Oh, I think you've got it.

05:14.836 --> 05:17.099
But you don't wanna
overdo it.

05:17.142 --> 05:18.666
You're right.

05:18.709 --> 05:22.713
Brevity is the soul of wit,
as Polonius said to Hamlet.

05:22.757 --> 05:26.108
Now I shall move on
to the villanelle.

05:26.151 --> 05:27.457
A more complicated form,

05:27.501 --> 05:30.939
but capable of much deeper
emotional resonance,

05:30.982 --> 05:34.159
as exemplified by Dylan Thomas'
"Don't go gentle--"

05:36.336 --> 05:37.641
Nia.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.382
All right,
what's next on the docket?

05:39.426 --> 05:41.428
Any celebrity divorces?

05:41.471 --> 05:43.168
Disgraced influencers?

05:43.212 --> 05:44.518
Show me the clicks.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.346
I've got this week's
medical examiner's report,

05:46.389 --> 05:49.653
and I thought we could
run a story on recent deaths.

05:49.697 --> 05:51.525
People love
to read about death.

05:51.568 --> 05:52.917
It reminds them
that they're alive,

05:52.961 --> 05:55.180
and it gives them
the pleasure of schadenfreude.

05:55.224 --> 05:56.051
I like it.

05:57.748 --> 06:00.795
Twenty-year-old Uber driver,
hit by a car.

06:01.404 --> 06:03.014
If the person is boring,

06:03.058 --> 06:05.408
then the cause of death
is boring.

06:05.452 --> 06:08.585
Wow me.
Show me some sparkly death.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.196
No, no, no...

06:11.240 --> 06:12.241
Um... Oh!

06:14.548 --> 06:16.898
Dr. Niles Jarrod,
a health tech billionaire,

06:16.941 --> 06:20.031
recently discovered deceased
in a night club bathroom.

06:20.075 --> 06:20.945
My God!

06:20.989 --> 06:22.686
Dr. Jarrod died?

06:22.730 --> 06:25.167
I... I interviewed him
last year--

06:25.210 --> 06:28.300
For your piece
on the moral implications
of gene manipulation.

06:28.344 --> 06:29.519
Knowing the dead person

06:29.563 --> 06:31.303
does not make
their death interesting.

06:31.347 --> 06:33.218
-Next.
-Wait, wait.

06:33.262 --> 06:34.785
A 33-year-old genius

06:34.829 --> 06:37.832
doing significant work
in the field of extending life

06:37.875 --> 06:40.356
dies young, unexpectedly?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.749
It's tragic.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.446
And certainly worth a story.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.534
There's hard news,

06:44.578 --> 06:46.667
legitimate feature,
or brain candy.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.059
Sentimental tripe
you just pitched us

06:48.103 --> 06:51.193
is a category of its own...
Trash.

06:51.236 --> 06:52.237
How dare you--

06:52.281 --> 06:53.369
William's right.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.979
A dead scientist
is not sparkly.

06:55.023 --> 06:57.460
And there's
no substantive story.

06:57.504 --> 06:58.722
So stop wasting our time.

06:58.766 --> 07:00.507
How do you know
there's no substantive story

07:00.550 --> 07:02.247
when we haven't even
looked into it yet?

07:02.291 --> 07:03.379
I've looked into it.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.424
Thoroughly.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.295
Nothing there.

07:06.338 --> 07:07.470
Franklin,

07:07.514 --> 07:08.732
next corpse, please.

07:16.740 --> 07:17.872
Perfect.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.749
I think you know more about
the Jarrod story,

07:25.793 --> 07:27.751
and for some reason
you don't want me on it.

07:27.795 --> 07:28.752
You're paranoid.

07:28.796 --> 07:31.146
You lied up there. Why?

07:31.189 --> 07:33.583
Stop humiliating yourself,
Danvers.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.150
It's painful to watch.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.590
I know that braid.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.289
-You okay?

07:44.333 --> 07:47.510
Yeah. I thought I had
William Dey pegged
as an ambitious ass,

07:47.554 --> 07:50.295
but I think
he might be much worse.

07:50.339 --> 07:53.168
-You remember that piece I did
on genetic engineering?
-Yeah.

07:53.211 --> 07:55.692
Well, my main subject,
Dr. Jarrod,

07:55.736 --> 07:57.346
was found dead in a club.

07:57.389 --> 07:59.087
-Overdose?
-Unclear.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.915
And William Dey
spiked the story.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.482
He said
he'd already looked into it

08:02.525 --> 08:03.613
and there was nothing more
to find.

08:03.657 --> 08:05.789
-So?
-He was lying.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.444
His heart rate
was through the roof.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.925
He knows something more
about Dr. Jarrod's death,

08:10.968 --> 08:12.796
and he doesn't want me
to find out about it.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.668
Sounds like we should
be calling my contact

08:14.711 --> 08:16.147
at the M.E.'s office.

08:16.191 --> 08:17.409
I'm sorry. We?

08:17.453 --> 08:19.324
Yeah. I mean,
I want to get out of my head

08:19.368 --> 08:20.891
about the job offers, and...

08:20.935 --> 08:22.763
We may have a murder to solve.

08:23.981 --> 08:25.548
Unless you don't want
a super friend.

08:25.592 --> 08:26.593
No, of course I do.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.812
Okay then.
I'll keep you updated.

08:29.204 --> 08:30.553
Okay.

08:30.597 --> 08:31.685
Nia, come on in.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.294
J'onn, what is it? Is it Mal?

08:33.337 --> 08:35.340
-No, no, no. Nothing like that.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.520
Another poem.

08:40.563 --> 08:44.306
Every hour of every day
Brainy sends a new ode
to a new body part.

08:45.873 --> 08:47.831
Sorry, um, not appropriate.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.833
Or important, right now.

08:50.399 --> 08:51.487
How can I help?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.054
I wanna restore
my missing memories.

08:53.097 --> 08:54.838
I was hoping that you
and your dream power

08:54.882 --> 08:57.319
might go deeper
than Kelly's technology could.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.931
Isn't messing with memories
dangerous?

09:00.975 --> 09:03.020
No, I believe
that restoring lost memories

09:03.064 --> 09:04.544
through dreams should be safe,

09:04.587 --> 09:07.851
because I will be finding them
myself in an organic way.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.244
With your help, of course.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.987
J'onn, are you sure
you want to remember?

09:13.814 --> 09:15.990
Malefic said
I was still in the dark.

09:18.427 --> 09:19.994
And I believe he's right.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.430
And one of those
missing memories

09:21.473 --> 09:23.911
has the key to unlock
why he betrayed our people.

09:23.954 --> 09:26.087
Why he's coming after
everybody I care about.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.569
If I can truly understand
what happened,

09:30.570 --> 09:32.136
I might be able to stop him.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.171
Pete Andrews?

10:08.303 --> 10:09.652
-What are you doing here?

10:09.696 --> 10:10.914
I haven't seen you in, what?

10:10.958 --> 10:12.263
Like two years?

10:12.307 --> 10:13.656
Well, one of the guys
posted something online

10:13.700 --> 10:15.179
about you working here.
So...

10:15.223 --> 10:16.703
That's funny, I just started.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.052
Well, I was in town,

10:18.095 --> 10:20.054
I thought I might drop by
and see your new digs.

10:22.012 --> 10:23.448
Kind of fancy, Olsen.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.016
Thanks.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.236
God, it's so cool of you
to stop by.

10:28.279 --> 10:29.150
Dr. Olsen.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.586
Your 1:30 appointment is here.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.632
Yeah. Ugh, I'm sorry.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.982
I would so love to catch up,
I just, I can't right now.

10:35.025 --> 10:38.246
Kelly, I came to
National City to see you.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.510
I think...

10:43.512 --> 10:45.296
I think I need help.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.558
Of course.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.953
My last appointment
wraps up around 6:30.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.999
Come back then, we'll talk.

10:52.434 --> 10:53.957
Thank you.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.567
You always had
the biggest heart in the world.

11:05.316 --> 11:06.187
Merci.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.232
Au revoir.

11:09.538 --> 11:10.844
You brought me
coffee eclairs

11:10.887 --> 11:13.585
from Cafe Rue Serret
on the Champs-Elysees?

11:13.629 --> 11:15.196
I know they're your favorite.

11:15.239 --> 11:16.806
And the cappuccinos,
did you really go to
Pave in Milan?

11:16.850 --> 11:18.373
It didn't take me that long.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.244
You know, I have really
been missing out
on the perks

11:20.288 --> 11:21.811
of having Supergirl
as a best friend.

11:21.855 --> 11:24.509
Well, we have a lot
of lost time to make up for.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.773
Yeah, but you know
you don't have to go to Paris

11:26.816 --> 11:27.817
to pick up lunch, Kara.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.645
That's not
what's important to me.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.168
But, these scones from Dublin,

11:31.212 --> 11:33.605
oh, my God,
you can fly these in everyday.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.870
Mmm. So, tell me,
how is CatCo?

11:36.913 --> 11:38.610
Is everything okay?

11:38.654 --> 11:40.351
Is Andrea behaving civilized?

11:40.395 --> 11:45.052
Oh, that's not exactly the word
I would use to describe her.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.317
Her mandate has been
making CatCo

11:49.360 --> 11:51.232
the most viewed news website
in the world

11:51.275 --> 11:55.018
using tactics like pop quizzes
and clickbait.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.716
Kara, I'm so sorry
to hear that.

11:56.759 --> 12:00.807
Yeah, and then she hired
this snake named William Dey.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.243
Wait, William Dey? Really?

12:02.286 --> 12:04.419
He's supposed to be
a really talented journalist.

12:04.462 --> 12:08.162
I know, but sadly, talent
doesn't always mean integrity.

12:08.205 --> 12:09.816
And I have no idea
what his MO is,

12:09.859 --> 12:12.732
but James is helping me
figure it out.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.298
Enough about me. How are you?

12:14.821 --> 12:15.691
Um...

12:16.953 --> 12:18.215
To tell you the truth,

12:18.259 --> 12:21.523
I haven't had the easiest time
of it since Lex.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.178
I've been having nightmares.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.919
I try not to sleep.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.137
Oh, Lena.

12:27.181 --> 12:29.009
Nights are filled
with apocalyptic visions

12:29.052 --> 12:31.663
of torture and anguish
at the hands of my brother.

12:31.707 --> 12:34.754
Kelly is working
with PTSD patients
at Obsidian North.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.233
Maybe she could help you.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.627
Thank you. But you know
how private a person I am.

12:39.236 --> 12:40.368
Yeah.

12:40.411 --> 12:41.499
You know,
the really frustrating part is

12:41.543 --> 12:43.632
I figured out a way
to heal myself.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.808
I mean, do you remember
the journals we found
at Stryker's?

12:45.852 --> 12:47.288
Of course.

12:47.331 --> 12:49.464
Well, reading them is
the only thing that calms me.

12:49.507 --> 12:53.773
Somehow, hearing Lex's voice
takes the mystery away.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.252
And the terror.

12:55.296 --> 12:57.646
I just know if I could
read them all then

12:57.689 --> 13:00.170
I would be able to cure myself
of the trauma.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.042
Well, then that's what
you have to do.

13:02.085 --> 13:04.087
Unfortunately
that is not an option.

13:04.131 --> 13:06.698
The government has confiscated
all of Lex's possessions.

13:06.742 --> 13:10.180
His technologies, his weapons,
even his childhood journals.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.921
Well, that's ridiculous.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.271
You're the only person that
could have an interest in that.

13:14.315 --> 13:15.795
Can't you just ask
for them back?

13:15.838 --> 13:17.231
Believe me, I have tried,

13:17.274 --> 13:18.798
but it is all tied up
in bureaucracy and red tape.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.800
My lawyer said I would never
get them out of Fort Summit.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.105
Well, I could get them for you.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.281
Kara, don't be ridiculous.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.196
The journals
will help you heal,

13:26.240 --> 13:29.112
and they're only locked up
due to a technicality.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.940
I could go and get them
and no one would ever know.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.855
No, I couldn't ask you
to do that.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.291
You're not asking.

13:34.335 --> 13:35.205
I'm...

13:35.945 --> 13:36.859
I'm offering.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.295
-Oh.

13:38.818 --> 13:39.644
Oh, it's James.

13:39.688 --> 13:40.732
He's at the M.E.'s office.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.256
That's okay, we can talk later.

13:46.521 --> 13:47.478
Thank you.

13:55.922 --> 13:56.923
Hey, we have five minutes.

13:56.966 --> 13:58.141
Okay.

13:58.185 --> 13:59.882
You okay? You look like
you robbed a bank.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.057
Robbed a bank?

14:01.101 --> 14:03.364
No, never.
I would never rob anything.

14:03.407 --> 14:05.714
It's, uh...
Just an expression, Kara.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.325
Right.

14:08.369 --> 14:10.458
Okay, healthy
33-year-old male.

14:10.501 --> 14:13.069
Cause of death, heart attack.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.811
EMTs found him unresponsive
on the bathroom floor

14:15.855 --> 14:17.204
in a nightclub downtown.

14:19.032 --> 14:20.381
There's something there.

14:21.904 --> 14:22.905
Is that a...

14:22.949 --> 14:24.646
tattoo?

14:24.689 --> 14:25.690
Inside his heart?

14:27.257 --> 14:30.173
How do you get a tattoo
inside your heart?

14:30.217 --> 14:33.873
This is t'fek'lya.
It may taste a little weird.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.048
It's a Martian herb

14:35.091 --> 14:37.093
which aids
in the connection of minds.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.226
Ugh.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.228
No, it's great.

14:43.578 --> 14:44.492
You ready?

14:45.014 --> 14:46.233
Let's do this.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.645
Get him! Get him!

15:07.689 --> 15:09.256
I don't understand.
What is this?

15:09.299 --> 15:10.910
Why are they in human form?

15:10.953 --> 15:12.737
Your memories
are being filtered

15:12.781 --> 15:13.869
through my subconscious

15:13.913 --> 15:15.479
in a way
that makes sense to me.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.220
J'onn, wait up.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.354
J'onn, I think that's you.

15:21.268 --> 15:22.965
Let's play hide and seek.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.967
J'onn, you're it.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.882
I remember playing this game.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.583
There.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.760
-Nice job.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.327
Malefic, you go now.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.989
He cannot connect
to the hive mind.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.121
He can't do it.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.080
-What's wrong with you?
-He can't do anything.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.393
Stop it, Malefic!

16:03.658 --> 16:04.789
Sleep.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.973
I thought
the White Martians

16:14.016 --> 16:15.583
used some kind of technology

16:15.626 --> 16:18.412
to turn Malefic
into a terrible weapon,

16:18.455 --> 16:20.501
but he was born that way.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.285
Born able to project
his thoughts

16:22.329 --> 16:24.331
and his will on others, but...

16:25.593 --> 16:28.552
cut off from my people
in the cruelest way.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.426
Where are we going, Papa?

16:32.469 --> 16:35.385
Where no one
can hurt you, my son.

16:42.349 --> 16:45.830
My beautiful son,
know that you are loved

16:45.874 --> 16:49.138
and that we will
pray for you everyday

16:49.182 --> 16:52.054
as you must pray yourself.

16:52.098 --> 16:56.319
Look to H'ronmeer's teachings
for guidance and healing.

16:56.363 --> 16:59.453
Let his counsel
lighten your pain,

16:59.496 --> 17:02.717
so that he might
deliver us to a better place.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.810
Father! J'onn!

17:08.853 --> 17:10.203
Don't leave me here!

17:10.246 --> 17:12.465
I'll be good. I promise.

17:12.509 --> 17:15.164
Our god will
never forsake you.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.732
Malefic, I love you.

17:19.907 --> 17:21.387
Please...

17:22.476 --> 17:24.042
Don't leave me here.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.392
I'll do anything.

17:31.702 --> 17:34.227
Malefic, it's J'onn.

17:34.270 --> 17:36.664
Father prays
for your healing everyday.

17:37.969 --> 17:40.407
He has faith that...

17:40.450 --> 17:42.670
one day you will return
home to us.

17:42.713 --> 17:45.368
H'ronmeer is not
my salvation, brother.

17:47.283 --> 17:48.980
They are.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.070
H'ronmeer...

17:52.245 --> 17:55.944
I failed you
as I failed my own son.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.686
Allowed Malefic

17:58.729 --> 18:01.080
to be conscripted
by the White Martians,

18:01.123 --> 18:05.954
allowed the council
to send him to that purgatory.

18:07.042 --> 18:09.436
The agony in my heart...

18:11.612 --> 18:13.309
It's...

18:14.963 --> 18:16.443
Unbearable.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.152
In my father's anguish,

18:30.196 --> 18:32.415
he must have wiped
both our memories.

18:34.330 --> 18:36.419
Wiped my brother
from existence.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.595
J'onn...

18:38.639 --> 18:41.381
Of course Malefic turned
against his own people.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.340
The isolation,

18:45.124 --> 18:47.126
the betrayal he must have felt.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.826
He wasn't evil,
he was a child.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.828
He needed our help.

18:53.871 --> 18:57.005
And then my father goes
and compounds the tragedy by...

18:58.398 --> 19:00.878
wiping his memory
from the collective.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.533
For Martians,
death isn't final,

19:03.577 --> 19:05.361
but erasing a memory is.

19:07.972 --> 19:09.583
It's as if my father...

19:10.671 --> 19:12.412
murdered his own son.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.068
And the hypocrisy.

19:18.287 --> 19:19.680
His whole life

19:20.507 --> 19:22.117
was about being a holy man.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.295
And then he goes and...

19:26.339 --> 19:28.950
commits our culture's
greatest sin.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.132
Where are the dumplings?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.220
Oh, shoot!

19:38.264 --> 19:40.179
I totally forgot
to put the order in.

19:40.222 --> 19:41.267
I'm sorry.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.790
I just got caught up
investigating

19:42.833 --> 19:45.575
the weird death of this guy
with a tattoo on his heart.

19:45.619 --> 19:46.533
Oh.

19:46.837 --> 19:47.969
Okay.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.492
I can see why you
forgot the dumplings.

19:49.536 --> 19:50.406
All's forgiven.

19:50.450 --> 19:51.668
Yeah, but there's more.

19:51.712 --> 19:53.670
William Dey, he knows
something about it,

19:53.714 --> 19:56.891
and he actively tried
blocking me
from getting involved.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.546
Well, it sounds like
a really good story, right?

19:59.589 --> 20:01.809
And this guy's always been
very competitive with you.

20:01.852 --> 20:04.028
Do you think he's trying to
just steal the scoop
for himself?

20:04.072 --> 20:06.422
Maybe. But something
just doesn't feel right.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.381
As fascinated as I am
by a dead guy

20:08.424 --> 20:10.383
with a tattooed heart,
I am far more interested

20:10.426 --> 20:12.211
in hearing about
your lunch with Lena.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.255
How did it go?

20:13.299 --> 20:14.778
Uh... It was great.

20:15.605 --> 20:16.998
-Uh-oh.
-Great.

20:17.041 --> 20:17.912
Oh, no.

20:17.955 --> 20:18.869
What happened?

20:18.913 --> 20:20.262
Nothing.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.873
I flew to Paris,
Milan, Dublin,

20:22.917 --> 20:24.266
I got all
of her favorite things.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.224
It was...

20:25.789 --> 20:27.051
Great.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.402
So why does it look like
you ran over a puppy?

20:29.445 --> 20:32.100
It was nothing.
Really. I...

20:32.143 --> 20:35.712
I just... I kind of
spontaneously agreed to...

20:36.583 --> 20:37.888
do a favor for Lena.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.368
Okay. So, what's wrong
with that?

20:39.412 --> 20:41.588
Nothing. It just entails...

20:41.631 --> 20:43.807
Breaking into
a secure Army facility

20:43.851 --> 20:45.418
and stealing
Lex Luthor's journals.

20:45.461 --> 20:46.549
What?

20:47.333 --> 20:48.725
Kara, are you
out of your mind?

20:48.769 --> 20:50.161
I just blurted it out.

20:50.205 --> 20:51.554
I wasn't thinking.

20:51.598 --> 20:53.382
But, you should have seen
how much pain she was in,

20:53.426 --> 20:55.776
and she's so traumatized
by Lex's death,

20:55.819 --> 20:57.734
and the journals
are the only way

20:57.778 --> 20:58.909
-she can find closure.
-No.

20:58.953 --> 21:00.346
You're going to call her
right now,

21:00.389 --> 21:01.695
and you're going to tell her
that you made a mistake.

21:01.738 --> 21:03.349
-You're not doing it.
-No. I can't.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.699
No. What you can't do
is break the law

21:05.742 --> 21:07.440
and steal federal property.

21:07.483 --> 21:09.268
Technically,
I break the law all the time.

21:09.311 --> 21:12.271
I just broke into
a supermax prison
two months ago.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.185
Okay.
That is totally different.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.449
That's to serve justice. Right?

21:16.492 --> 21:17.667
Okay. What you're
talking about here

21:17.711 --> 21:19.495
is crossing that line
for a friend.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.105
How is it different?

21:21.149 --> 21:23.760
She deserves to heal,
and who would it be hurting?

21:25.153 --> 21:26.546
You know what?

21:26.589 --> 21:28.939
Brainy just illegally hacked
into security cameras

21:28.983 --> 21:32.291
at a nightclub to help me solve
this Dr. Jarrod's murder.

21:32.334 --> 21:33.988
I don't see you scolding him.

21:34.031 --> 21:35.250
Totally different.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.425
But... Yes,

21:36.469 --> 21:38.122
Brainy should
not be using DEO tech

21:38.166 --> 21:39.210
to help you write articles.

21:39.254 --> 21:40.603
I will crack down on that.

21:40.647 --> 21:42.170
Just want to point out.

21:42.213 --> 21:44.607
Who do you think we learned
all this rule-breaking from?

21:45.565 --> 21:46.870
That cuts deep.

21:53.007 --> 21:56.010
That's Dr. Jarrod,
with William Dey.

21:56.053 --> 21:57.620
And what would he
be doing there?

21:59.840 --> 22:01.015
- Hang on.

22:01.450 --> 22:02.582
Let me zoom in.

22:03.670 --> 22:04.888
That's... the spider.

22:04.932 --> 22:06.847
That's the tattoo on his heart.

22:09.110 --> 22:11.330
What do you see?
Do you know that woman?

22:11.373 --> 22:12.896
No. But...

22:13.854 --> 22:15.595
I know those tattoos.

22:19.947 --> 22:21.992
So, tell me
what you're going through.

22:22.036 --> 22:23.080
Migraines.

22:23.690 --> 22:24.908
Panic attacks.

22:24.952 --> 22:27.258
Well, getting pinned
by snipers in Kandahar

22:27.302 --> 22:28.999
is hard on the psyche.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.958
I'm not the same person
I was before.

22:31.001 --> 22:33.395
Afghanistan
took something from me.

22:33.439 --> 22:37.312
Something in my brain
is broken.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.705
And I want it back.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.665
Can you help me?

22:44.058 --> 22:46.016
I have an opening
this Friday,

22:46.060 --> 22:48.497
and we'll start
the intake process.

22:48.541 --> 22:50.543
It can take
a few months to qualify--

22:50.586 --> 22:51.805
No!

22:52.980 --> 22:54.068
Oh, I'm so...

22:54.547 --> 22:56.157
Kelly, I can't wait.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.767
I'm in crisis now.

22:57.811 --> 22:59.595
If I don't
get a handle on this...

23:00.509 --> 23:02.032
I'm scared
I'm gonna hurt myself.

23:02.076 --> 23:04.557
I am not going to let you
hurt yourself, Pete.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.689
You have to understand...

23:06.733 --> 23:07.995
it's not that simple.

23:08.038 --> 23:10.650
My job is new,
and then there's protocol...

23:10.693 --> 23:12.391
Kelly, please help me.

23:19.615 --> 23:21.835
The office will
thin out in an hour,

23:21.878 --> 23:23.576
and I'll sneak you in later.

23:23.619 --> 23:25.360
We'll start
with the diagnostic,

23:25.404 --> 23:26.579
and get you some answers.

23:26.622 --> 23:27.884
But Pete...

23:27.928 --> 23:29.712
we have to keep this
on the down-low.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.410
-Is that okay?
-Oh, of course.

23:33.107 --> 23:34.282
You're a life saver.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.031
Something is bothering you.

23:46.599 --> 23:47.948
No, it's nothing.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.994
Your pupil dilation
says otherwise.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.129
You can tell me anything.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.917
Brainy, if you had something

24:00.961 --> 24:04.268
really important
to tell someone, but...

24:05.922 --> 24:08.272
if you did tell them,
it would hurt them very much,

24:08.316 --> 24:09.404
would you still do it?

24:11.145 --> 24:13.234
In my experience...

24:13.277 --> 24:15.802
if you care about someone,
you should tell them the truth.

24:16.367 --> 24:17.412
However painful,

24:17.456 --> 24:19.153
both of you
will be better for it.

24:20.633 --> 24:21.677
If you are still feeling blue,

24:21.721 --> 24:24.288
I could cheer you up
with a poem.

24:25.507 --> 24:28.162
"An Ode to Nia Nal's
Left Earlobe.

24:28.205 --> 24:29.163
-A Villanelle--"
-No!

24:30.338 --> 24:31.774
Please, no.

24:35.256 --> 24:38.128
Is there something
you wanted to tell me?

24:44.395 --> 24:45.701
No. Um...

24:46.789 --> 24:48.312
But there is something

24:48.356 --> 24:49.357
that I have to tell J'onn.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.796
They aren't tattoos.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.319
This is an Aurafacian.

24:55.363 --> 24:58.497
This is an alien organism
that attaches to a host body.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.803
This is the original host.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.326
This Aurafacian
was one of the aliens

25:02.370 --> 25:04.677
that Lex had transferred
out of our desert facility,

25:04.720 --> 25:06.113
and obviously
is still at large.

25:06.156 --> 25:08.115
It can transform back and forth
between a tattoo

25:08.158 --> 25:10.030
and a three-dimensional
creature, making her

25:10.073 --> 25:12.772
uniquely dangerous
and very hard to stop.

25:13.642 --> 25:14.600
Now...

25:14.643 --> 25:15.731
Meet our new host.

25:19.735 --> 25:21.389
-Can we get an ID?
-Yeah.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.175
And...

25:25.219 --> 25:26.220
Bingo.

25:26.263 --> 25:27.264
Caroline O'Connor.

25:27.308 --> 25:29.179
She's former
special ops command,

25:29.223 --> 25:32.443
she's highly rated
in hand-to-hand combat,
explosives,

25:32.487 --> 25:35.011
and she's a sniper.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.578
She went off the radar
two years ago,

25:36.622 --> 25:39.015
and somehow hooked up
with our alien.

25:39.059 --> 25:41.017
So somebody
hired her to kill Jarrod.

25:41.061 --> 25:42.932
Yeah. But who? And why?

25:42.976 --> 25:45.021
Well, someone went a long way
to cover her tracks.

25:45.065 --> 25:47.023
- Not far enough.

25:47.067 --> 25:48.677
We just got an address.

25:48.721 --> 25:50.418
I'm not gonna let her
hurt anyone else.

26:04.388 --> 26:07.043
A flash drive
hidden behind a dresser?

26:07.261 --> 26:08.610
Huh.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.917
I don't think
I invited you here.

26:11.439 --> 26:12.745
I invited myself.

26:22.015 --> 26:24.191
Yeah.
I came prepared.

26:47.257 --> 26:47.910
James!

26:47.954 --> 26:49.042
Kara!

26:53.655 --> 26:55.483
This device uses
magnetic resonance

26:55.526 --> 26:57.572
to attract the heavy metals
in their ink.

26:57.616 --> 26:58.442
You ready?

26:58.486 --> 26:59.618
Yeah.

27:10.150 --> 27:12.239
We're examining the evidence
from O'Connor's apartment,

27:12.282 --> 27:15.242
including the external drive
you located, Supergirl.

27:15.285 --> 27:18.158
I am simultaneously attempting
to break the encryption on it,

27:18.201 --> 27:20.203
but...
it is far more complicated

27:20.247 --> 27:23.163
than anything I've seen
in the next 1,000 years.

27:23.206 --> 27:25.687
All right.
Let's get these down
into holding.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.341
Ew. Ew.

27:29.169 --> 27:30.039
You okay?

27:30.518 --> 27:31.388
Yeah.

27:32.172 --> 27:34.000
I've been hit harder than that.

27:34.043 --> 27:36.263
You didn't have to do that.

27:36.306 --> 27:37.786
With everything you have
on your plate,

27:37.830 --> 27:39.658
your potential
run for Senate...

27:40.746 --> 27:42.138
What if she really hurt you?

27:42.182 --> 27:44.532
When your friend's in trouble,
you jump in, period.

27:46.012 --> 27:47.535
Doesn't matter
the consequences.

27:51.321 --> 27:52.540
You keep resting.

27:52.583 --> 27:54.455
Tell Alex and Brainy
that I'll be right back.

27:54.498 --> 27:56.849
I'll be on comms
if they get a lead on O'Connor.

27:56.892 --> 27:57.806
Okay.

27:57.850 --> 27:58.938
Where you going?

28:00.417 --> 28:01.375
To help a friend.

28:03.769 --> 28:04.813
It's late, you all right?

28:04.857 --> 28:06.119
I need to show you something.

28:10.558 --> 28:13.300
It's the rest of your dream
about what happened on Mars.

28:13.909 --> 28:15.258
The part you didn't see.

28:16.216 --> 28:17.696
Do you want to see it?

28:19.175 --> 28:21.047
Because it's going
to be painful.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.398
Absolutely.

28:30.230 --> 28:32.580
H'ronmeer...

28:33.494 --> 28:37.498
I failed you
as I failed my own son.

28:38.499 --> 28:40.675
The agony in my heart...

28:43.286 --> 28:44.157
It's...

28:46.725 --> 28:48.291
Unbearable.

28:50.032 --> 28:52.382
Father, you did the best
you could for Mal.

28:53.644 --> 28:54.907
It's not your fault.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.604
He was my boy.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.172
My child.

29:00.216 --> 29:01.914
He could not control
his illness.

29:01.957 --> 29:04.655
The test was mine
and I failed!

29:05.744 --> 29:07.571
I do not deserve to live.

29:10.966 --> 29:14.230
And how can I continue
to counsel our people...

29:16.842 --> 29:18.452
when I myself am nothing.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.064
Father, our people need you.

29:24.763 --> 29:25.676
I need you.

29:27.287 --> 29:30.638
Then I have failed everyone.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.210
H'ronmeer, forgive me.

30:00.624 --> 30:01.669
It was me.

30:02.888 --> 30:03.758
I'm sorry.

30:04.411 --> 30:06.587
I erased him from our minds.

30:08.154 --> 30:11.679
I as good as murdered
my own brother.

30:11.722 --> 30:13.637
To save your father.

30:14.682 --> 30:15.814
To save us both.

30:19.905 --> 30:20.819
I had, uh...

30:23.212 --> 30:25.736
I had gone to my father
to seek counsel.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.697
To ease my own pain.

30:32.178 --> 30:33.832
And seeing him like that...

30:38.445 --> 30:40.403
Rather than finding
the strength to lift him up,

30:40.447 --> 30:41.491
I, uh...

30:43.537 --> 30:44.581
I crossed a line

30:44.625 --> 30:46.453
that's unforgivable
in my culture.

30:50.370 --> 30:52.763
I spent
the last 300 years...

30:55.027 --> 30:57.159
trying to repent
for having fled Mars...

30:59.031 --> 31:00.380
only to find out

31:02.121 --> 31:04.166
that is the least of my sins.

31:06.038 --> 31:08.475
Oh, I am so ashamed.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.477
You did it out of compassion.

31:10.520 --> 31:11.695
Out of goodness.

31:11.739 --> 31:13.393
Your father was heartbroken.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.570
You saved him.

31:18.572 --> 31:20.182
My father

31:20.226 --> 31:22.881
would rather die than have
his holy mind wiped.

31:24.230 --> 31:26.188
What I did, I did for myself.

31:29.148 --> 31:30.584
You must swear to me...

31:32.238 --> 31:34.414
you will never speak of
what you saw...

31:35.197 --> 31:36.372
to anyone.

31:37.591 --> 31:38.592
I swear.

31:44.598 --> 31:46.817
These will scan your brain

31:46.861 --> 31:48.167
and read your memories.

31:48.210 --> 31:51.387
And your memories
will appear on this screen.

31:51.431 --> 31:53.215
You... You can
see my memories?

31:53.259 --> 31:55.391
Just so I can help you
process them.

31:55.435 --> 31:56.915
Everything's confidential.

31:57.567 --> 31:58.960
Okay, but...

31:59.004 --> 32:00.266
So, they're just gonna...

32:01.093 --> 32:02.224
appear there in real time?

32:02.268 --> 32:03.878
Uh, no, there's a bit of a lag.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.228
It takes a few minutes
for the mapping to finish

32:06.272 --> 32:08.143
and the image generators
to do their thing.

32:09.101 --> 32:10.580
Don't worry.

32:10.624 --> 32:11.451
You'll do great.

32:12.800 --> 32:13.670
Let's do it.

32:33.342 --> 32:34.735
Supergirl?

32:34.778 --> 32:36.128
Brainy cracked the encryption
on O'Connor's drive.

32:36.171 --> 32:37.694
Her next target is
Dr. Andrew Stern

32:37.738 --> 32:39.653
at National City Hospital.
We're en route.

32:39.696 --> 32:40.654
I'm on my way.

32:45.137 --> 32:47.269
Supergirl, I got him.
We're in the atrium.

32:47.313 --> 32:48.967
Dr. Stern,
we have reason to believe

32:49.010 --> 32:51.012
that you are the target of
an assassination attempt--

32:51.056 --> 32:53.449
Ah!

32:53.493 --> 32:55.582
-Dr. Stern?

32:57.149 --> 32:58.324
Nice shot.

33:04.112 --> 33:05.766
You're really
starting to bug me.

33:25.307 --> 33:26.352
You're him.

33:31.531 --> 33:33.707
My inception power.
It worked.

33:45.675 --> 33:46.676
It's Kelly.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.056
Who do you work for?

34:18.099 --> 34:19.318
Who do you work for?

34:20.058 --> 34:21.059
-Alex!

34:25.628 --> 34:26.498
She's dead.

34:27.587 --> 34:28.630
What just killed her?

34:39.251 --> 34:40.991
Thank you, human.

34:41.034 --> 34:42.297
You have returned my power.

34:44.603 --> 34:46.475
What?
What are you doing to me?

34:46.518 --> 34:49.522
This is the power that
the Phantom Zone took from me.

34:49.565 --> 34:51.697
The power
to control your mind.

34:53.308 --> 34:54.962
You can thank
your weakness for this.

34:55.005 --> 34:58.052
In gratitude,
I'll grant you a quick death.

34:59.314 --> 35:01.055
No...

35:02.187 --> 35:03.492
Please.

35:07.801 --> 35:08.671
Malefic! No!

35:10.325 --> 35:12.632
No! H'ronmeer's curse.

35:39.441 --> 35:40.442
Freeze.

35:40.486 --> 35:42.183
Help.
They're trying to kill me.

35:42.227 --> 35:43.619
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:53.020 --> 35:54.456
There he is. The coffee guy.

35:57.459 --> 35:59.853
No, no, no, wait.
There he is, the janitor.

36:02.029 --> 36:03.030
You can see me?

36:10.907 --> 36:11.821
Kelly, look out.

36:17.392 --> 36:18.480
He's gone.

36:22.484 --> 36:23.398
What happened?

36:23.442 --> 36:24.834
Malefic came after her.

36:24.878 --> 36:27.446
My psychic scan shows
no serious signs of trauma.

36:27.489 --> 36:29.012
But it would seem
the release of Q-waves

36:29.056 --> 36:30.840
somehow interacted
with Obsidian's tech

36:30.884 --> 36:34.061
and forged a link between
Kelly's mind and Malefic's.

36:34.104 --> 36:36.803
She could see him,
even when he shapeshifted.

36:37.717 --> 36:39.197
Well, if she can see him...

36:39.240 --> 36:40.807
Then she's a threat to him.

36:40.850 --> 36:42.635
I'm afraid
it's even worse than that.

36:42.678 --> 36:44.854
My brother now has
the Martian power to incept.

36:44.898 --> 36:47.683
Make you do the things
he wants you to do
against your will.

36:47.727 --> 36:49.511
He'll come after her again.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.731
He'll come after all of you.

36:51.774 --> 36:53.863
Have you been able
to figure out
why he's doing this?

36:56.518 --> 36:58.955
I put him
in the Phantom Zone

36:58.999 --> 37:00.522
for betraying my people.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.524
I guess he just wants revenge.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.265
Look, I'm sorry
that your association with me

37:04.309 --> 37:05.614
has put you all in danger.

37:06.311 --> 37:08.008
Malefic is my responsibility.

37:08.051 --> 37:08.922
Right now...

37:10.184 --> 37:12.055
we need to get Kelly to safety.

37:12.099 --> 37:14.493
Taking her off the board
is gonna be our best bet.

37:14.536 --> 37:16.408
That way I can focus
all of my attention

37:16.451 --> 37:19.019
and our DEO resources
on finding him.

37:19.062 --> 37:20.325
You want me to go away?

37:20.368 --> 37:22.501
Yes. But just until
we catch him.

37:22.544 --> 37:24.851
I think Alex is right.

37:24.894 --> 37:26.896
But don't worry,
I will stay with you. Okay?

37:26.940 --> 37:28.768
No, you've got
decisions to make.

37:28.811 --> 37:30.073
I don't want you missing out.

37:30.117 --> 37:31.771
But you are my priority.

37:33.294 --> 37:34.513
You should leave tonight.

37:41.737 --> 37:42.956
How did it go with J'onn?

37:43.435 --> 37:45.001
Good.

37:45.045 --> 37:47.003
Turned out not to be
that big of a deal.

37:50.137 --> 37:52.139
I can sense that something
is weighing on you.

37:53.619 --> 37:56.099
Well, nothing lifts the spirit
like a villanelle--

37:56.143 --> 37:57.013
Stop.

37:59.625 --> 38:01.235
You said I had to be honest
even if it hurts your feelings,

38:01.279 --> 38:02.323
so here's the truth.

38:02.367 --> 38:05.805
It's just... too much. Okay?

38:05.848 --> 38:08.938
From now on, no more food,
no more poems,

38:08.982 --> 38:10.026
no more anything.

38:12.420 --> 38:14.117
I know...

38:14.161 --> 38:15.902
that you mean well.

38:15.945 --> 38:19.340
I know where
you're coming from,
and it's... sweet.

38:19.384 --> 38:22.212
It's all so sweet.
I... I just...

38:24.476 --> 38:25.651
It's too much.

38:28.001 --> 38:32.788
You... You asked me
to be myself.

38:32.832 --> 38:36.139
To be completely
myself with you.

38:36.183 --> 38:40.883
But now you tell me
you don't want that.

38:41.884 --> 38:46.236
I can only operate at 100%.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.413
That's just how I'm built.

38:48.456 --> 38:51.198
Which is entirely my problem...

38:52.678 --> 38:54.027
and not yours.

39:00.903 --> 39:01.861
Brainy.

39:14.221 --> 39:15.265
I heard about Jarrod.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.399
Yeah.

39:18.443 --> 39:20.314
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this all going.

39:21.402 --> 39:22.229
Keep at it.

39:23.448 --> 39:24.362
And good luck.

39:42.292 --> 39:43.598
You were right.

39:43.642 --> 39:45.905
I was too open
and too trusting.

39:47.123 --> 39:48.255
It's all my fault.

39:50.518 --> 39:51.432
I hope they help.

39:51.476 --> 39:52.825
They already have.

39:55.654 --> 39:57.133
I hope we haven't crossed
any boundaries?

39:57.177 --> 40:00.267
No, for a friend like you
there are no boundaries.

40:06.882 --> 40:08.884
Don't tell me
where you're going, all right?

40:08.928 --> 40:09.885
It's going to be better
that way.

40:09.929 --> 40:12.105
-Okay.
-Thank you, James.

40:14.281 --> 40:15.282
Hey.

40:15.543 --> 40:16.414
Here.

40:17.284 --> 40:18.546
Take this.

40:18.590 --> 40:20.548
It's one of Lex's
transmatter portal watches.

40:20.592 --> 40:21.897
Don't ask me how I got it.

40:22.942 --> 40:25.379
Just... If there's trouble,
just use it.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.467
Thank you.

40:26.511 --> 40:28.077
Everything
is going to be okay.

40:28.121 --> 40:30.123
I'm going to find Malefic
and I'm going
to bring you home.

40:33.822 --> 40:35.433
-Bye.
-Drive safe.

40:44.529 --> 40:46.618
You know, you say
everything's going to be fine,

40:46.661 --> 40:49.142
but... I know that face.

40:49.795 --> 40:51.013
You don't believe it.

40:51.057 --> 40:53.538
Look, I love the fact
that she's so open.

40:53.581 --> 40:56.366
It just scares
the life out of me.

40:57.716 --> 40:59.848
Well, maybe...
Maybe it's not so bad,

40:59.892 --> 41:01.241
and it will all work out.

41:02.068 --> 41:03.809
It worked out
with me and Lena.

41:04.723 --> 41:05.985
I hope so.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.074
For the both of us.

41:12.948 --> 41:14.341
Did you find what you need?

41:15.734 --> 41:16.952
Take a look.

41:16.996 --> 41:18.084
Tell me what you see.

41:18.998 --> 41:20.782
Lex's childhood journals.

41:23.263 --> 41:26.571
Hmm. Not seeing schematics
or anything technical.

41:26.614 --> 41:28.486
It's Lex's version
of a Vigenere cipher.

41:28.529 --> 41:32.185
It's a deceptively complex
polyalphabetic substitution.

41:35.318 --> 41:36.189
Ah...

41:36.668 --> 41:37.843
I see it now.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.715
Deciphering now.

41:51.726 --> 41:53.206
Now I know what I have to do.
