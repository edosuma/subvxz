WEBVTT

00:16.182 --> 00:17.475
I have a heart condition.

00:21.938 --> 00:24.691
- And I'll be a--
- Hey, we'll figure this out.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.359
- It'll be okay.
<i>-</i> <i>Will it, new girl?</i>

00:26.359 --> 00:29.029
From here, it looks like
the train's gonna radiate our nuts.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.739
<i>Au contraire, mon fr√®re,</i>
don't make that move.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.157
I have to cut power to magnets.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.534
The train will drop from the tracks
and detonate like a dirty bomb,

00:34.534 --> 00:36.411
destroying your country's ability
to grow food.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.455
I'm no farmer,
but I'm pretty sure famine's bad.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.750
My wife and son are asleep
five minutes from here.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.252
I have to derail it
before it reaches Nur-Sultan.

00:44.252 --> 00:46.504
- Our friends are on that train.
- Screw everyone else.

00:46.504 --> 00:48.173
We're in the path of that soul train,

00:48.173 --> 00:51.176
so I have a vested interest
in stopping it too, just not this way.

00:51.176 --> 00:54.345
You are not inspectors.
You could be with terrorists.

00:54.345 --> 00:55.847
We're undercover CIA.

00:55.847 --> 00:57.515
Then show me your identification.

00:57.515 --> 00:59.726
Do I really have to explain
"undercover" to you?

01:00.560 --> 01:04.189
- You move, I'll shoot!
- Then my hand will fall on the switch.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.818
I have an idea, but it's dangerous.

01:08.818 --> 01:11.362
More dangerous than an out-of-control
nuclear bullet train?

01:11.362 --> 01:12.655
Good point.

01:12.655 --> 01:14.199
If cooling the magnets
speeds the train up,

01:14.199 --> 01:16.534
<i>then warming them
would slow it down, right?</i>

01:16.534 --> 01:18.661
If I could just
pump something hot in there.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.372
- That's what Donnie's thinking.
- Nuclear sludge. It's warm.

01:21.372 --> 01:23.708
Yes. Open the window to the tanker car,

01:23.708 --> 01:25.919
I'll go up, grab the hose,
and feed it through.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.463
No. The train is going too fast.
It will blow you off.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.298
If I don't try, we could all die.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.342
Well, if you do try,
you'll definitely die.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.927
We can't do nothing.

01:37.388 --> 01:38.389
I might have a plan.

01:43.561 --> 01:46.147
If we move real closely together,
this should work.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.607
I can't believe you brought these.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.567
Thought we could use them in our downtime.

01:50.151 --> 01:51.945
Okay, here's the plan. I go outside,

01:51.945 --> 01:54.114
and you anchor me
through the aluminum roof.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.658
I'm half your size.
Less surface area for the wind to grab me.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.118
I can't let you go out there.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.578
- Chief, only Emma's way works.
- What could possibly happen?

02:00.578 --> 02:03.498
She could fly off and hit the rock
at a hundred miles an hour.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.708
There's a downside,
but we need to get this done.

02:05.708 --> 02:06.793
I can do this...

02:09.963 --> 02:11.131
but I need your help.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.752
I'm almost there.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.466
- This thing is all over the place.
-  <i>You have to wrestle it down.</i>

02:55.466 --> 02:57.427
We're running out of track fast.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.888
- Just be careful.
<i>-</i> <i>Dad, I can't reach it.</i>

03:00.388 --> 03:02.765
You gotta let me go so I can leap for it.

03:02.765 --> 03:04.684
No, that's too big of a risk.

03:04.684 --> 03:07.770
If I don't get this thing,
we all die anyway.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.022
I said no.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.734
When I was little,

03:13.610 --> 03:16.696
you used to toss me in the air
and then catch me.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.656
<i>You never missed.</i>

03:18.656 --> 03:19.782
I trust you.

03:19.782 --> 03:21.034
I missed once.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.204
You bounced off the ottoman,
and your mother was really pissed off.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.331
I don't wanna be that guy,
but ticktock, Luke.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.416
Dad, I did what Dr. Pepper said.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.001
I asked you for help.

03:30.501 --> 03:31.878
Now it is your turn.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.796
<i>You have to listen to me.</i>

03:33.796 --> 03:35.632
Please, just let me go.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.368
I got you, baby.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.245
I got you.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.791
You gotta pull the hose
back into the conductor's booth

04:09.791 --> 04:12.293
<i>and attach it to the fuel valve
next to the nitrogen tank.</i>

04:12.293 --> 04:15.338
<i>It's uniform with the tanker valve,
so the hose should fit into place.</i>

04:16.297 --> 04:17.674
Flip the pump switch next to it.

04:21.970 --> 04:25.098
- Magnet's already warming.
- We have steady deceleration.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.266
We're slowing.

04:28.309 --> 04:29.477
I think we did it.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.064
I think we did.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.818
It's stopped. It's over.

04:38.861 --> 04:41.656
- You're not part of this, Borat.
- Yeah, you're not part of it.

04:46.869 --> 04:49.330
But the bottom line is,
we didn't catch Boro,

04:49.330 --> 04:51.082
and Boro didn't get what he needed.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.084
So, for now, a tie is as good as a win.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.378
<i>What are you, my daughter's soccer coach?</i>

04:55.378 --> 04:57.338
<i>I want Boro on a plate.</i>

04:57.338 --> 05:01.009
<i>Also wanna know how Kazakhstan
almost turned into a nuclear wasteland.</i>

05:01.592 --> 05:03.136
- Oh, uh--
- A technical glitch.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.263
Static on the comms.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.473
We misheard the number of valves to flood.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.683
<i>Really?</i>

05:10.476 --> 05:11.686
<i>Get some rest while you can.</i>

05:11.686 --> 05:13.187
I've already got a dozen operatives

05:13.187 --> 05:16.107
sweeping every digital signal
on the planet looking for Boro.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.693
Once we get a bite,
you're off the sidelines.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.283
Appreciate you covering for me.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.952
I appreciate you
listening to me on the train.

05:27.952 --> 05:30.705
It wasn't easy letting you go like that.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.416
Never has been.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.461
All surveillance of Donnie stops,

05:36.461 --> 05:39.339
or I narc you out to Dot and Mom.

05:40.923 --> 05:41.758
Right.

05:42.633 --> 05:43.468
Hey, Barry,

05:44.719 --> 05:46.429
shut down Operation Don Juan.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.016
And I googled "cuckolding."

05:51.267 --> 05:53.019
I owe you an apology.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.020
<i>Copy that.</i>

05:54.979 --> 05:56.064
Satisfied?

05:56.064 --> 05:57.065
For now.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.902
If you don't mind, I need to make a call.

06:08.242 --> 06:09.202
Sit...

06:09.994 --> 06:10.828
Butt.

06:13.831 --> 06:15.750
<i>Hey, hey!
You're, uh, already back at the office?</i>

06:15.750 --> 06:19.128
Hey. Um, yeah, I should be done
in the next few hours.

06:19.128 --> 06:23.883
Look, I was thinking about
this whole Nana Pat situation.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.969
I know you hate being lied to,

06:26.969 --> 06:29.263
especially by somebody who loved you,

06:30.390 --> 06:33.017
but maybe she lied to you
because she loves you.

06:33.017 --> 06:35.019
I mean, she didn't have much, right?

06:35.019 --> 06:38.731
Then she gives you this clock
and tells you this whole story

06:38.731 --> 06:41.150
because she knows
it's gonna make you happy. And it did.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.652
<i>Until I learned the truth.</i>

06:42.652 --> 06:45.279
Exactly. Maybe the truth is overrated.

06:46.364 --> 06:49.742
I mean, maybe lying isn't always so bad.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.703
<i>That's the exact opposite
of everything I teach my students,</i>

06:52.703 --> 06:56.249
<i>but, uh, yeah, I guess I could
cut Nana Pat some slack.</i>

06:56.249 --> 06:57.208
Cool.

06:58.709 --> 07:02.130
Hey, um... I was thinking

07:02.839 --> 07:05.842
maybe we could play
some of those Lee Fields songs

07:05.842 --> 07:09.429
and, I don't know... have a wild night

07:09.429 --> 07:11.889
sanding and staining that clock.

07:11.889 --> 07:16.060
I bought some top-shelf wood stain

07:16.060 --> 07:18.062
from the hobby store down the street.

07:18.062 --> 07:18.980
Is that Russian?

07:19.689 --> 07:21.107
The guy said it's the best.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.443
<i>All right. That sounds good.
I'll make up a cheese plate.</i>

07:23.443 --> 07:24.569
<i>I love you.</i>

07:24.569 --> 07:26.028
<i>And that... is no lie.</i>

07:26.988 --> 07:28.364
- I love you too.

07:28.364 --> 07:32.118
Hey, Roo and I are gonna go grab
a "post-save the world" lager. You in?

07:32.827 --> 07:34.954
I-- I can't. I have plans.

07:34.954 --> 07:35.955
Next time then.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.582
I mean, after what you pulled off today,

07:37.582 --> 07:40.209
I'm sure there'll be
other opportunities for celebrations.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.378
Amazing work, seriously.

07:42.378 --> 07:43.588
Ciao, bella.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.557
I put the table saw in the garage.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.643
You could have held onto that.
No one but you ever needs it.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.854
I don't have any room for it.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.857
Um... look...

08:03.608 --> 08:05.526
I don't need the table saw.

08:05.526 --> 08:10.740
It's just that... Donald is the first guy
that you've gotten serious with,

08:10.740 --> 08:12.742
and so it's really weird

08:12.742 --> 08:15.745
when another man has family dinners

08:16.746 --> 08:17.788
with my family.

08:18.372 --> 08:21.250
So if you ever have
an extra spot for me at the table...

08:23.794 --> 08:25.463
I would love to get an invite.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.049
How about right now?

08:28.049 --> 08:30.885
I can throw
some leftover lasagna in the oven.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.303
I would love it.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.221
Good.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.410
Boro.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.411
Hello, William.

08:57.411 --> 09:00.122
You may have escaped Guyana,
but you can't escape me.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.624
- Shh!

09:01.624 --> 09:04.627
Let me explain.
You had a job interview yesterday.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.088
I hope it went well.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.132
Anyway,

09:11.133 --> 09:12.635
you were leaving the building...

09:13.344 --> 09:14.345
A man got out of a truck.

09:14.345 --> 09:17.890
And we sprayed you with chloroform, and...
here you are.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.520
Now, I assume you'd like to go home
to your wife and child?

09:22.520 --> 09:24.021
Oh, please.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.900
Well... all you have to do

09:27.900 --> 09:30.945
is tell me everything you know

09:30.945 --> 09:33.864
about Finn Hoss and Danielle DeRosa.

09:35.366 --> 09:38.452
What did you learn
when you were all betraying me together?

09:38.452 --> 09:40.705
I-- I don't know.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.415
I...

09:43.916 --> 09:46.419
I don't know.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.796
What did they say?!

09:50.298 --> 09:51.716
What did you hear?!

09:51.716 --> 09:53.134
Where were they going?!

09:53.134 --> 09:54.885
I don't know! We were being shot at!

09:54.885 --> 09:57.388
- What did they tell you?!
- Nothing!

09:57.388 --> 10:00.016
They were arguing. I couldn't hear.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.060
He called her Emma!

10:05.438 --> 10:07.189
- Emma?
- Yeah.

10:07.898 --> 10:09.233
Finn called her Emma.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.611
And she plays the violin.

10:11.611 --> 10:16.032
I heard him say something about
her hurting her violin arm.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.825
Emma. Violin.

10:18.659 --> 10:21.329
That's all I know, Boro! I swear it!

10:24.165 --> 10:25.041
Okay.

10:27.001 --> 10:27.877
Emma.

10:29.670 --> 10:30.588
Violin.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.050
Good job, Will.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.556
Cut off his leg,
in case there's something else he forgot.

10:40.556 --> 10:41.474
No!

10:42.933 --> 10:46.479
Wait! No! Please!

10:46.479 --> 10:48.939
No!

10:54.612 --> 10:57.281
This man said his name was Finn Hoss.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.993
He said he was my father's friend

11:02.495 --> 11:03.454
and my friend.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.667
All lies.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.961
He murdered my father.

11:12.588 --> 11:13.756
He's an evil man

11:14.465 --> 11:16.509
intent on doing evil things.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.221
He's dangerous,

11:21.013 --> 11:23.474
and he needs to be stopped
before he hurts others.

11:26.394 --> 11:29.939
The only way this will happen
is if you help me find him.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.860
What I have told you and this photograph

11:35.820 --> 11:37.071
is all I have to go on.

11:40.866 --> 11:44.078
Finn Hoss is affiliated
with an untrustworthy American

11:45.037 --> 11:47.998
who goes by Emma and plays the violin.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.127
All we know

11:52.002 --> 11:52.920
is "Emma"...

11:54.630 --> 11:55.464
and "violin."

11:58.801 --> 11:59.760
Find her.

12:01.929 --> 12:02.972
Find Finn.

12:04.765 --> 12:05.808
Whoever does

12:06.851 --> 12:08.853
gets one million US dollars.

12:21.323 --> 12:22.575
<i>‚ô™ Take the jib sail down... ‚ô™</i>

12:22.575 --> 12:25.035
Hey, Rooster. Come on, have a beer.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.454
-  All right.
-  Live it here.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.330
- Come on, let's celebrate.
- Earned this.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.373
-  Let's go.
- You too.

12:29.373 --> 12:30.416
- Hey, cheers.
- Hey.

12:30.416 --> 12:34.420
To Boro laying low and licking his wounds
after a resounding defeat.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.547
- Hear, hear.
- Hey. Cheers.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.798
-  Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.675
And to the Tally-Ho.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.555
- What's that?
- You're standing on her.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.432
It's a gesture to win my wife back.

12:48.309 --> 12:51.228
- You think that one through, chief?
- It's a British call to action.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.438
To move forward.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.774
It's the Tally-Ho.

12:58.527 --> 13:01.781
Uh-oh. Shit.
I just had it painted on this morning.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.617
At least the princess isn't here
to go tattle to Mommy.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.743
I invited Emma.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.329
But Carter's probably
keeping her busy scrapbooking.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.873
Oh, you really--
Like, you really hate this guy, huh?

13:10.873 --> 13:13.834
Is he, like, super handsome,
or rich, or something?

13:13.834 --> 13:15.377
Yeah, or something. That's right.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.338
Sir, this is amazing.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.048
Twice the size of my apartment.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.007
Oh, thank you.

13:20.007 --> 13:23.010
First of all, I like that "sir" stuff,
so keep it up.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.262
Second, come on, grab a beer.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.306
What are you waiting for?

13:27.306 --> 13:29.809
- Thank you.
- We're celebrating here.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.061
Why'd you invite the NSA stooge?

13:32.061 --> 13:34.522
She did good work on the train job.
I figured she'd wanna see a cool boat.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.066
-  It's not a boat. It's a ship.
-  Ew.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.275
- You have a crush on her.
- What?

13:38.275 --> 13:40.945
You wanna get naked
and push your stuff together.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.239
No. She is a co-worker.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.157
Then why is your right temple pulsating?

13:45.157 --> 13:46.992
You're sweating through
your <i>Transformers</i> t-shirt.

13:46.992 --> 13:47.910
It's <i>Voltron</i>.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.454
If you had a heart monitor on,
it'd be buzzing like a bee's butthole.

13:50.454 --> 13:53.123
Okay, you're right. Just keep it down.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.628
- Is that a text from your boyfriend?
- Mm.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.463
Boyfriend?

13:59.463 --> 14:02.132
No, I'm single as a dollar bill.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.176
- Good.
- This is a bot alert that I set up.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.387
Just for you, or maybe you wanna share?

14:06.387 --> 14:08.556
Uh, well, I set up an algorithm--

14:08.556 --> 14:10.099
-  What?
- Use your outside voice.

14:11.517 --> 14:15.396
Uh, well I set up an algorithm
to search social media, news articles,

14:15.396 --> 14:18.148
even classifieds
that might be just tangentially related

14:18.148 --> 14:21.068
to anything associated
with radioactive material,

14:21.068 --> 14:23.445
nuclear hardware, Cesium-137.

14:23.445 --> 14:25.656
Anything that could be Boro
poking his head up.

14:25.656 --> 14:26.824
Smart thinking.

14:26.824 --> 14:27.867
Thank you, sir.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.452
Well, I got a hit on a news story

14:30.452 --> 14:33.289
about a Moldovan scientist
who was kidnapped in Ireland.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.292
His research focused
on repurposing radioactive waste.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.793
Could be a coincidence.

14:37.793 --> 14:38.752
Could be a lead.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.881
- How long will it take to figure this out?
- Couple hours.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.090
Cruise is over.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.049
Okay.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.011
- Hey...

14:47.761 --> 14:48.596
Good work.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.347
Thank you.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.433
I'm so nervous. He's a legend.

14:54.351 --> 14:57.354
You know, I can grab Emma on the way
if that makes things easier for you.

14:57.354 --> 15:00.524
No, that's okay. I will pick her up.
We need to talk anyway.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.026
- Right, good idea.
-  All right.

15:02.026 --> 15:02.943
But you're my ride,

15:02.943 --> 15:05.029
- and I gotta change shirts before work.
- Oh...

15:05.029 --> 15:07.656
- Roo made me gut the fish.
- I'll give you a lift, stinky.

15:07.656 --> 15:08.657
Come on. We gotta go.

15:10.993 --> 15:14.538
And remember, guys, I'll see you
at the car wash in two hours.

15:14.538 --> 15:15.748
-  Okay.
-  Great.

15:19.293 --> 15:22.755
<i>‚ô™ And I love you and your auntie ‚ô™</i>

15:22.755 --> 15:26.383
<i>‚ô™More than
Triple-decker double-cherry pie ‚ô™</i>

15:26.383 --> 15:29.136
<i>‚ô™ And I love you and your auntie ‚ô™</i>

15:29.136 --> 15:32.097
<i>‚ô™ More than all the birds
That fly up in the sky ‚ô™</i>

15:50.741 --> 15:51.825
You're a good doobie.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.120
- How's Romi?
- She's good. She's good, yeah.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.665
Motrin's brought her fever down, so...

15:57.665 --> 15:58.624
Good.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.128
Uh, yeah, Oscar texted.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.297
His MyAisles' meeting's running late.

16:05.297 --> 16:08.509
Oh, it's fine, I don't mind.
I love looking after her.

16:08.509 --> 16:11.178
And... it is good practice.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.265
- Oh, for us?
- Yes. Oh yeah.

16:15.265 --> 16:18.185
Right. Not for right now,
but, you know, sometime.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.104
Yeah, that'd be crazy.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.983
It'd be crazy for right now, right?

16:23.983 --> 16:26.151
Or... or that'd just be crazy?

16:26.652 --> 16:29.905
Because, like, you--
You always said you wanted kids.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.031
Yeah, yeah.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.159
Yeah, in theory.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.202
But...

16:35.202 --> 16:36.745
...lately, I've...

16:37.621 --> 16:41.417
I've been thinking about families
and how easy it is to screw them up.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.503
Ye-- Yeah, it is.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.838
But why would ours--

16:45.838 --> 16:47.798
Our-- Ours wouldn't be screwed up.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.174
No. No, it'd be great.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.175
- It's just--
- Yeah.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.304
We're putting the cart before the horse.
We're not even engaged.

16:54.304 --> 16:57.933
No, um, but we will be soon enough, right?

16:57.933 --> 17:01.270
And then, you know,
we're gonna want a family<i>,</i>

17:01.270 --> 17:03.397
so, like, it can't hurt to talk about,

17:04.732 --> 17:08.193
you know, how we'd wanna raise kids,
where we'd wanna raise them,

17:08.193 --> 17:10.279
some sort of work-life balance.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.782
What do you mean work-life balance?

17:15.075 --> 17:15.951
Oh man.

17:15.951 --> 17:20.330
Uh, just the balance
between work and life.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.209
You know, uh...

17:25.627 --> 17:26.587
Shit.

17:26.587 --> 17:29.214
Okay, we've both got jobs, right? Okay?

17:29.214 --> 17:32.718
Yours... takes you away a lot.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.053
Sorry, I'm confused.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.388
Are you saying that

17:37.097 --> 17:40.893
you aren't sure that I could be
a good mom because I work?

17:40.893 --> 17:43.312
No. No, no, no. God, no. No.

17:43.312 --> 17:46.648
I'm just saying that personally,

17:47.399 --> 17:51.862
uh, I think I benefited from having
my mother at home when I was a kid.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.655
- Unreal.
- What?

17:53.655 --> 17:57.117
If the roles were reversed,
if I was a teacher and you had my job,

17:57.117 --> 17:59.661
no one would even ask you
if you could handle it.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.748
It would just be expected
that I would stay home with the baby.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.793
Okay, that's-- That's not what I'm saying.

18:05.793 --> 18:09.046
It's what you insinuated,
even if you don't realize it.

18:09.671 --> 18:11.048
Let's not do this, okay?

18:11.048 --> 18:13.801
We don't need to fight, um,
or whatever this is.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.011
I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.763
I just, um...

18:19.640 --> 18:21.850
You're right. You're right.
We're not even engaged.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.061
-  Knock, knock.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.479
I'm sorry I'm disturbing.

18:25.479 --> 18:28.524
I just wanted to check
if Emma is available for lunch.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.734
Maybe at this new burger place
at the car wash.

18:32.486 --> 18:36.281
Sure, Dad. If... if Carter's willing
to keep an eye on Romi.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.783
Of course.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.827
Yeah, I'll stay home with the baby.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.832
- Were you eavesdropping?
- No.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.376
I was just coming to pick you up.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.962
Can't I see my own daughter
in my own house anymore?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.797
Hasn't been your house for 15 years.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.465
Tell this to my mortgage payments.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.593
- Hey, guys.
- Hey. Perfect timing.

18:56.593 --> 18:59.429
Look at this.
Who's the schlepper? Oh, it's Donnie.

18:59.429 --> 19:00.848
- Hey, Luke. Emma, hi.
-  Yeah.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.058
Hey, I have good news. I got the Oden.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.810
- Your ship?
- Here.

19:05.561 --> 19:06.395
Wow.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.647
It's... Wow.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.649
- Wait until you go out on it.
-  I wish.

19:10.649 --> 19:14.153
But I can't. I got an ear thing.
Get seasick very easily.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.321
Oh, that's okay. I didn't ask you.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.742
That's a very sweet offer,
but work's crazy.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.870
HR is overwhelmed downsizing.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.247
It's terrible.
Good people losing their jobs--

19:25.247 --> 19:29.126
Yeah, the firings are rough.
I keep telling her she'll get used to it.

19:29.126 --> 19:32.921
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- But, Tally, you're kind, you're caring.

19:32.921 --> 19:35.841
If anyone can make the co-workers
feel that there's still hope,

19:35.841 --> 19:38.302
that things will work out
even in the darkest hours,

19:38.302 --> 19:39.428
it's you.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.138
You have a big heart.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.931
Even when we ended our marriage,

19:42.931 --> 19:46.393
you still made me feel that there's hope,
that things will work out.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.438
I guess. Kinda.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.983
And things did work out for you.

19:53.483 --> 19:54.359
You're okay.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.653
Not yet,

19:57.529 --> 19:58.989
but I still have hope.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.035
- Okay, cool. Shall we go?
- Yeah.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.119
Bye-bye.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.163
You good, yep?

20:06.997 --> 20:08.874
Bye, Donnie. So good to see you.

20:11.710 --> 20:14.129
-  I'll be just a minute.
- All right, bud.

20:14.129 --> 20:16.548
Oh, wow! Dude.

20:16.548 --> 20:20.719
Bartholomew Putt died today
of terminal celibacy.

20:20.719 --> 20:24.890
He is survived by millions of toys
and zero girlfriends.

20:25.891 --> 20:26.934
They're action figures.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.436
They're vagina repellent.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.773
- I choose not to bring women here.
- Mm.

20:32.773 --> 20:35.817
This is my Batcave,
my Fortress of Solitude.

20:35.817 --> 20:38.695
Well, if your goal's solitude,
mission accomplished.

20:38.695 --> 20:42.366
The only person that would be
turned on by this is Santa.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.368
What is this?

20:44.368 --> 20:45.786
I'm an aspiring oboist.

20:45.786 --> 20:49.164
Good move.
Nothing drops panties like a woodwind.

20:49.164 --> 20:52.459
- I'm getting a clean shirt.
- I'm just busting your chops.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.627
Come on.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.838
Listen, if you want a shot with Tina,
you gotta ditch all this stuff,

20:56.838 --> 20:58.799
even if it just barely helps your odds.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.885
"Never tell me the odds."

21:03.762 --> 21:04.846
Han Solo.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.556
- What did I just say?

21:06.556 --> 21:07.724
Now go get changed.

21:07.724 --> 21:10.519
And if you put on something
with a hobbit or something like that,

21:10.519 --> 21:11.812
you'll get a fresh one.

21:11.812 --> 21:12.729
Okay.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.525
I'm doing this for you, okay?

21:16.525 --> 21:18.819
I'm just trying to get some V for your D.

21:26.743 --> 21:28.328
So just for the record,

21:28.328 --> 21:30.414
I'm 100% on board

21:30.414 --> 21:32.833
with the
"Don't have children with Carter" policy.

21:34.584 --> 21:35.752
You were eavesdropping.

21:35.752 --> 21:38.255
I'm a spy. Of course I eavesdrop.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.757
I didn't say
I don't wanna have kids with Carter,

21:40.757 --> 21:43.176
I just said I think we should wait a bit.

21:43.677 --> 21:46.013
I love Carter very much, okay?

21:46.013 --> 21:48.807
The CIA side of my life
is a little chaotic,

21:48.807 --> 21:51.518
but he's... he's steady
and... and predictable.

21:51.518 --> 21:54.563
Steady and predictable is something
you want from your accountant,

21:54.563 --> 21:56.064
but not from your life partner.

21:56.064 --> 22:00.319
Your mother still is the most exciting
and the most challenging person

22:00.319 --> 22:01.486
that I've ever known.

22:01.486 --> 22:05.657
You need to find somebody that can
stimulate your mind and your heart,

22:05.657 --> 22:08.702
not some nerd that wants to do
artsy-crafty stuff with you.

22:08.702 --> 22:11.079
Hey, I like doing artsy-craftsy stuff.
It's soothing.

22:12.247 --> 22:16.126
Do I sometimes wish
he was a little bit more adventurous? Yes.

22:16.126 --> 22:17.961
But-- You know what? Why--

22:17.961 --> 22:20.130
Oh my God, you're the last person on Earth

22:20.130 --> 22:22.632
I should be discussing
relationship stuff with.

22:22.632 --> 22:25.093
I just watched you beg Mom
to get on your little boat

22:25.093 --> 22:26.762
like a lovesick schoolboy.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.473
One, it was just a casual invitation.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.768
Two, it's not a boat. It's a ship.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.936
Okay, well, that ship has sailed.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.233
The kidnapping Tina stumbled onto

22:40.233 --> 22:43.945
was of Moldovan applied physicist,
Dr. Karl Novac.

22:43.945 --> 22:48.450
He was in Ireland on a goodwill tour
to pump up Moldovan scientific prowess.

22:49.159 --> 22:51.286
First blush is,
disappearance seems insignificant.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.331
But Dr. Novac authored a scientific paper

22:54.331 --> 22:56.166
outlining a novel process

22:56.166 --> 22:59.378
to extract and augment
fissile nuclear material

22:59.378 --> 23:00.545
from nuclear waste.

23:00.545 --> 23:03.965
So Boro grabbed Poindexter
to salvage something useful

23:03.965 --> 23:05.967
from that little bit
he got from the train?

23:05.967 --> 23:09.763
- That's the theory we're going with.
- But Boro basically kidnapped a chef.

23:09.763 --> 23:11.681
I mean,
he still needs his kitchen utensils

23:11.681 --> 23:13.975
to make his radioactive dish.

23:13.975 --> 23:16.311
If we can figure out
what that hardware is,

23:16.311 --> 23:18.939
maybe we can get to it first
and then catch Boro.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.982
Possibly. But there's a speed bump.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.985
We've only ever seen an abstract
of Dr. Novac's paper.

23:23.985 --> 23:28.490
The official scientific research
explaining the extraction process

23:28.490 --> 23:30.700
was blocked from publication
by the Moldovan government.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.370
Instead, they labeled him a national asset

23:33.370 --> 23:36.206
and moved him to a government dormitory
with a handler

23:36.206 --> 23:39.793
to protect him from spies and IP theft
and prevent defection.

23:39.793 --> 23:44.256
- The whole dormitory's air-gapped?
- No Wi-Fi, no landline, no way to hack in.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.007
Except for this.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.467
That's why we have Air-hopper.

23:47.467 --> 23:51.096
It's an app that can suck
all the data from any nearby hard drive.

23:51.096 --> 23:56.059
It's camouflaged in a shell
of a popular game <i>Jam Slam</i>.

23:56.059 --> 23:58.145
But how is the team
supposed to get past security

23:58.145 --> 24:00.439
to get into the dormitory
to even use the app?

24:00.439 --> 24:03.066
The only way to get in is to be invited
by someone who lives there.

24:03.650 --> 24:07.654
Fortunately, Novac's handler,
Nika Stalinovich, lives at the dorm.

24:08.238 --> 24:12.701
So she will have to invite home
someone from our team.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.202
Pooh Bear.

24:14.202 --> 24:16.204
Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear!

24:16.204 --> 24:21.793
Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear!

24:22.377 --> 24:23.628
What the hell is Pooh Bear?

24:24.212 --> 24:27.340
Aldon's Pooh Bear on account
of all the honeypots he collects.

24:27.340 --> 24:28.467
Gross.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.594
Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear!

24:30.594 --> 24:32.512
- All right, knock it off.
- Sorry.

24:32.512 --> 24:33.555
Sorry, boss.

24:34.514 --> 24:37.476
Stalinovich will have all
of Novac's research on her computer,

24:37.476 --> 24:38.393
so Aldon will...

24:38.393 --> 24:39.644
Pooh Bear.

24:39.644 --> 24:43.231
...use what little charm he has
to access her dorm

24:43.231 --> 24:45.066
and download the paper using the app.

24:45.734 --> 24:47.277
That should lead us to Boro's next move.

24:47.277 --> 24:49.654
Great.
So, what does this lucky lady look like?

24:50.530 --> 24:53.450
-  Boo.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.912
There are no known photos of Nika,

24:56.912 --> 24:59.289
as government handlers
are kept clandestine,

24:59.289 --> 25:03.793
but I put together
a very interesting psych profile.

25:05.003 --> 25:09.466
Nika Stalinovich is a mid-level manager
suffering from low self-esteem

25:09.466 --> 25:12.802
due to Novac's kidnapping
during a tour she signed off on.

25:13.553 --> 25:16.056
Standard operating procedure
after such an incident

25:16.056 --> 25:19.351
usually means the retraining
of all government handlers.

25:19.351 --> 25:23.730
That would mean
a full day of re-education in a hotel,

25:23.730 --> 25:24.648
The Bad Buffet.

25:26.900 --> 25:30.612
Luckily for us, just down the street
from the hotel is a bar.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.906
After hours of public humiliation,

25:32.906 --> 25:36.368
our backer, Nika,
will make her way across the street

25:36.368 --> 25:39.621
where she will drown her sorrows
in some plum brandy.

25:39.621 --> 25:42.999
So if Dr. Pepper is right,
the bar's our way in.

25:42.999 --> 25:45.210
Pfeffer, like in "Michelle."

25:45.210 --> 25:47.128
Dr. Pepper's theory
on Nika's state of mind

25:47.128 --> 25:48.672
should make her open and vulnerable

25:48.672 --> 25:51.716
to my very unique brand
of romantic... persuasion.

25:51.716 --> 25:56.012
Your plane leaves in 12 hours,
as Nika's retraining finishes in 24.

25:56.012 --> 25:59.558
I'll make sure there's a friendly asset
standing by with transpo for you.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.767
Okay, get going everyone.

26:00.767 --> 26:02.185
- Let's go.
-  Okay.

26:13.697 --> 26:14.906
Is everything in place?

26:14.906 --> 26:16.324
Just waiting for a few shipments.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.495
These are daisies. I asked for dog rose.

26:20.495 --> 26:22.497
Yeah, but daisies are in season.

26:26.876 --> 26:28.169
I will get the dog roses.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.338
Excellent.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.549
I want it all to be perfect.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.430
You're gonna be checkmated
in no time.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.889
- That's for sure.
- Seriously, Dad?

26:40.473 --> 26:43.476
Could you have requisitioned
a more unflattering outfit for me?

26:43.476 --> 26:46.938
Well, you can't be Aldon's backup
if everyone in the bar is hitting on you.

26:46.938 --> 26:49.107
About time you got a taste of it.

26:49.107 --> 26:52.152
They always make me look like
a Baltic washerwoman.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.737
Yeah, I should probably get ready too.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.614
I gotta have the right bait
to reel in the fish.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.324
- Speaking of which,

26:57.324 --> 27:00.493
I'm a little worried about
this "no photo of Nika" thing.

27:00.493 --> 27:02.537
Everybody thinks
you always land a rainbow trout,

27:02.537 --> 27:05.540
but every now and again,
a sea robin just plops on deck,

27:05.540 --> 27:07.292
- or a blobfish.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.418
Don't laugh at that.

27:08.418 --> 27:09.753
Quick question.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.421
Did you participate
in one of these missions

27:11.421 --> 27:12.631
when you were married to Mom?

27:14.466 --> 27:16.384
- Did you ever have an affair?
- Oh!

27:16.384 --> 27:19.095
I never once had an affair
while I was married to your mother.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.808
Well, that killed the mood.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.613
- I could've been indecent.
- You are indecent.

27:36.613 --> 27:39.032
The way you speak is disrespectful to me

27:39.032 --> 27:42.035
and every woman
you have seduced in the line of duty.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.244
You know what? You're right.

27:43.244 --> 27:47.290
I was just trying to be funny. It wasn't.
For the record, I respect women a ton.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.792
Yeah, sure you do.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.670
Hey, I'm just straightforward about sex
on or off the job.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.213
I treat women as equals, okay?

27:53.213 --> 27:54.923
We all have needs, right?

27:54.923 --> 27:56.508
I make offers with physical engagement.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.885
If it's a yes, then great,
we'll both have a fantastic time,

27:58.885 --> 28:00.762
because I'm really, really good
at intercourse.

28:00.762 --> 28:03.431
But if it's a no,
then hopefully we become friends.

28:03.431 --> 28:05.684
- What's more respectful than that?
- So many things.

28:05.684 --> 28:10.230
First of all, your order of operations,
sex first, then maybe friendship?

28:10.230 --> 28:13.191
Clearly women have one function
in your book.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.235
- Roo and I are best friends.
- Roo is gay.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.862
You guys are buddies
because sex is off the table.

28:17.862 --> 28:21.366
I've had sex off a table, on a table,
and under a table at a Sur La Table,

28:21.366 --> 28:23.076
and no, the irony isn't lost on me.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.829
Bottom line,
honeypotting isn't easy, okay?

28:25.829 --> 28:27.122
It's an art and a science.

28:27.122 --> 28:31.209
No, it's an excuse for
arrested development frat boy bullshit,

28:31.209 --> 28:32.377
and you know it.

28:43.596 --> 28:45.974
Green light. Cameras are in place.

28:45.974 --> 28:46.891
<i>Pool chalk,</i>

28:46.891 --> 28:48.476
operational.

28:48.476 --> 28:49.519
<i>Eraser,</i>

28:50.145 --> 28:51.396
operational.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.397
<i>Salt shaker,</i>

28:53.940 --> 28:56.234
operational.

29:00.697 --> 29:02.490
People are filtering out of the hotel.

29:02.490 --> 29:03.908
Retraining must be over.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.536
We'll alert you
if we see anyone who could be Nika.

29:06.536 --> 29:08.121
<i>Hope she has no sense of smell.</i>

29:08.121 --> 29:09.247
Caught a whiff of Aldon.

29:09.247 --> 29:12.500
He's like a category four
Drakkar Noir tsunami.

29:12.500 --> 29:15.044
Pop culture in Eastern Europe
is 30 years behind the US.

29:15.044 --> 29:18.673
They're into Zima,
'90s emo rock, and Drakkar Noir.

29:18.673 --> 29:20.258
Nika's gonna love it.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.509
And if she doesn't?

29:22.260 --> 29:23.094
Simple.

29:25.305 --> 29:26.556
Shock and awe.

29:26.556 --> 29:27.640
<i>We may have a hit.</i>

29:27.640 --> 29:30.477
Tall blonde, appears to be
coming out of the retraining.

29:31.060 --> 29:33.563
Man, Aldon's got a horseshoe up his ass.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.486
I have the best job.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.864
Anya. What'll it be?

29:43.490 --> 29:46.367
Well, that's a negative
on Nika Stalinovich. Damn it.

29:48.244 --> 29:50.789
Thanks for ruining our day, Nik.

29:52.749 --> 29:55.710
-  Did he just say Nik?
- Could Nika actually be a Nik?

29:55.710 --> 29:58.046
Nik is a very common name
in this part of the world.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.215
You're a real goatfucker,

30:00.215 --> 30:01.341
Stalinovich.

30:02.091 --> 30:04.302
Tell me there's a lot
of Stalinoviches in this region.

30:04.302 --> 30:07.055
Apparently, Nika Stalinovich was a typo.

30:07.055 --> 30:09.516
Our target is Nik A. Stalinovich.

30:09.516 --> 30:10.850
- Shit.
- Shit.

30:10.850 --> 30:12.852
- Shit.
- This is hilarious.

30:12.852 --> 30:14.229
Hang on, don't panic.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.033
- Okay, he's definitely straight.
<i>-</i> How do you know?

30:27.033 --> 30:28.827
<i>Well, he didn't want any of this.</i>

30:28.827 --> 30:31.287
- We have to pivot. I'll take the lead.
<i>-</i> <i>Absolutely not.</i>

30:31.287 --> 30:33.581
- We abort now.
<i>-</i> On what grounds?

30:33.581 --> 30:37.460
On the ground that I carry a photograph
of her in pigtails in my wallet.

30:37.460 --> 30:40.505
Wallet photos? How old are you?

30:41.005 --> 30:42.841
- I can do this.
-  Damn right you can.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.927
Get to the bathroom and de-frump yourself.
I'll be back in a minute.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.269
No, you shut it down. I'm senior officer.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.396
Then you know it violates protocol
to abort a mission

30:56.396 --> 30:57.981
for any reason other than imminent death

30:57.981 --> 31:00.692
or severe bodily injury
to an officer or civilian.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.236
You may experience severe bodily injury.

31:03.236 --> 31:05.780
I will not let my daughter
do the honeypot.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.032
This isn't a honeypot, it's a honey drop.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.869
She just talks to the guy,
gets him to take her back to his place,

31:10.869 --> 31:14.622
uses the hopper to record the data,
and then she's off with her pants on.

31:15.790 --> 31:18.042
At worst, there'll be some heavy petting.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.797
Luke, she is a good officer.

31:22.797 --> 31:24.048
Let her do her job.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.634
And I'm gonna go do mine.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.930
Hey, ladies.

31:31.764 --> 31:32.682
Let's make a deal.

31:40.148 --> 31:42.191
Okay, good. That's already an improvement.

31:44.068 --> 31:45.820
- Try these.
- Where'd you get those?

31:45.820 --> 31:47.947
Just a little help from some friends.

31:49.115 --> 31:49.949
Got it.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.368
- Yep.
- There you go.

31:52.368 --> 31:53.786
Let me give you my shirt.

31:54.370 --> 31:56.164
Nothing sexier
than a woman in a man's shirt.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.790
Do not take off your shirt.

31:57.790 --> 31:59.834
Aldon might still get a honeypot.

32:00.418 --> 32:01.502
Luke, the shirt you gave her

32:01.502 --> 32:04.088
looks like something from
the Little Women Abstinence Collection.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.506
That's it. I'm coming in.

32:05.506 --> 32:08.509
Bad idea. You cause a commotion,
Nik gets nervous and leaves.

32:08.509 --> 32:10.303
- Play it cool.
<i>-</i> <i>Oh, shut up, Barry.</i>

32:10.303 --> 32:13.514
It's your fault that she's
in this situation in the first place.

32:13.514 --> 32:15.600
You should've never
let the CIA recruit her.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.852
My fault? You think the CIA
would've recruited her

32:17.852 --> 32:19.437
if her last name wasn't Brunner?

32:19.437 --> 32:20.647
This is your fault.

32:21.648 --> 32:25.109
I need a break from hearing people argue
about who's at fault for decisions I made.

32:25.109 --> 32:26.235
That's a good idea.

32:28.029 --> 32:28.863
Okay.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.449
Here you go. I'm sorry for the sweat.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.454
- And just leave a few buttons open--
- Yeah, okay, I got it.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.831
- I know how to look hot.
- My bad.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.418
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

32:42.418 --> 32:44.504
- You sure?
- Yeah.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.881
Uh-huh. Look, it's just us here.

32:46.881 --> 32:48.257
Look, truth?

32:50.093 --> 32:52.929
- I don't always love doing this, okay?

32:52.929 --> 32:55.473
Sometimes it's weird and creepy
or just awkward and unpleasant.

32:56.432 --> 32:59.560
A lot of times,
it leaves me feeling... pretty awful.

33:02.355 --> 33:05.316
That's
"be with me, my darling" in Swahili.

33:05.984 --> 33:09.737
I've said that in three dozen languages
and, uh, never once meant it.

33:10.613 --> 33:12.949
So yeah, laughing with the gang
can sometimes make it easier,

33:12.949 --> 33:15.243
but if you don't wanna do this,
we can find a workaround.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.244
End of story.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.287
It's not that. It's...

33:19.205 --> 33:21.958
I... I've honeypotted
once or twice before. It's just...

33:25.044 --> 33:26.295
It sounds stupid, but I...

33:27.588 --> 33:30.800
I've never so much as kissed anybody
since I've been with Carter.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.511
I've never been unfaithful.

33:34.137 --> 33:36.431
You're not being unfaithful.
You're simply doing your job.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.600
Now I can't say I've ever been
in your exact position before

33:39.600 --> 33:43.021
because... I've never been
in a real relationship,

33:43.021 --> 33:45.398
but you should know that
what you're doing is for Carter

33:45.398 --> 33:46.941
and all the other
schoolteachers out there,

33:46.941 --> 33:50.445
and their students, parents, podiatrists,
and everyone else in the world.

33:50.445 --> 33:53.072
Because stopping Boro means saving lives.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.408
You're doing nothing wrong, Emma.

33:58.244 --> 33:59.746
It's actually good advice.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.956
Yeah, shallow waters run deep, right?

34:01.956 --> 34:05.334
Okay, I'm gonna airdrop you
the <i>Jam Slam</i> app.

34:05.334 --> 34:06.961
- There you go.

34:07.837 --> 34:09.589
All right, you look great. You ready?

34:10.840 --> 34:12.675
- Yeah.
- I'll be in that booth if you need me.

34:13.551 --> 34:14.385
But you got this.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.764
- I know.
- Oh, one last thing.

34:17.764 --> 34:20.433
You can't ask Nik back to his place.
He has to invite you.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.560
- Why?
- We don't wanna raise any suspicion.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.064
And women like you never have to ask.

34:26.064 --> 34:26.981
They only get asked.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.151
Okay, you're on in one.

34:31.694 --> 34:32.612
Game face.

34:37.450 --> 34:41.496
Look at that. New outfit for Princess.
What a surprise.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.335
Bad night?

34:48.252 --> 34:50.546
I don't speak Spanish.

34:51.047 --> 34:53.716
Romanian? Russian?

34:53.716 --> 34:56.427
Uh, some English?

34:56.427 --> 34:57.720
I know English, yes.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.681
Oh.
Then I'll ask again, bad night?

35:01.557 --> 35:03.726
Well, my co-workers and boss,

35:03.726 --> 35:06.771
they blame me for something
that wasn't my fault.

35:06.771 --> 35:07.855
Oh.

35:07.855 --> 35:09.607
I know what that's like.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.651
Your boss interfering with your work,

35:11.651 --> 35:13.528
<i>even if you don't need their help.</i>

35:13.528 --> 35:16.989
<i>even if they're out-of-touch,
overbearing know-it-alls.</i>

35:16.989 --> 35:19.617
Seriously?
I mean, what did I do to deserve this?

35:19.617 --> 35:21.410
She is the worst, right?

35:21.410 --> 35:23.830
I mean, we should just dump her
from the squad,

35:23.830 --> 35:25.748
go back to when I started out, you know?

35:25.748 --> 35:28.709
Just you and me, Luke and Roo.

35:29.377 --> 35:30.878
Team Loo.

35:33.005 --> 35:34.632
Can I buy you a drink?

35:34.632 --> 35:36.050
At least one.

35:37.426 --> 35:39.220
<i>You've got him hooked.
Now reel him in.</i>

35:39.220 --> 35:42.473
Mimic his body language.
It'll make him feel like you're in sync.

35:42.473 --> 35:43.474
Thank you.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.270
So... tell me about yourself.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.856
- Well, there's not much to tell.

35:49.856 --> 35:52.817
<i>Hi, it's Emma.
Leave me a message.</i>

35:53.317 --> 35:55.570
Hi. It's, uh, it's me.

35:55.570 --> 35:59.740
Um, yeah, I don't know.
I feel terrible about our argument,

35:59.740 --> 36:01.159
and...

36:01.159 --> 36:03.411
<i>If you're happy
with your message, press one.</i>

36:03.411 --> 36:05.580
<i>If you'd like to delete your message,
press two.</i>

36:07.707 --> 36:08.875
<i>Message deleted.</i>

36:10.543 --> 36:12.837
My employer expects so much from me,

36:12.837 --> 36:16.841
but then they put me up
in this tiny hotel with no hot water.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.050
You should see my place.

36:18.050 --> 36:19.886
The only unit in the complex,

36:19.886 --> 36:23.598
<i>with beautiful climbing white wisteria
around the window sills.</i>

36:23.598 --> 36:25.725
<i>You can smell them through the glass.</i>

36:25.725 --> 36:28.519
Bingo, that's enough info
to find our lover boy's apartment.

36:28.519 --> 36:30.980
We're not going anywhere
as long as she's with that creep!

36:30.980 --> 36:33.316
Come on, Aldon ain't that bad.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.775
<i>Emma can take care of herself.</i>

36:34.775 --> 36:37.528
I'm watching her six
if things go sideways. Go recon.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.838
Guard's got a HK416 series.

36:55.838 --> 36:58.758
Ah, there. White flower bullshit
around the window.

36:59.592 --> 37:01.052
It's gotta be Nik's place.

37:04.263 --> 37:06.265
That flagpole right across from it?

37:06.849 --> 37:08.809
- Can you make that shot?
- It's geometry.

37:08.809 --> 37:11.145
I can make that shot
with your eyes, old man.

37:11.145 --> 37:14.774
The guard will hear the rifle crack,
and a silencer would affect accuracy.

37:14.774 --> 37:16.150
Barry, hook me up.

37:16.817 --> 37:19.528
Already searching for buildings
with appropriate sight lines.

37:19.528 --> 37:22.406
Tina, text me current wind speed
and humidity readings.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.367
Best candidates seem to be
the fifth-floor window

37:24.367 --> 37:26.035
of a hospital a half a mile away.

37:26.035 --> 37:28.204
On my way.
Oh, what department's the fifth floor?

37:29.413 --> 37:30.456
Are you messing with me?

37:31.249 --> 37:32.750
All right, I gotta go to a supermarket

37:32.750 --> 37:35.044
to get a hot water bottle
and a can of oxtail soup.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.504
- I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

37:40.216 --> 37:43.302
Good job, you're a natural.
Time to close the deal.

37:43.302 --> 37:45.388
Why don't you ditch this loser

37:45.388 --> 37:48.140
and have a drink with some real men?

37:48.140 --> 37:50.393
Come on, guys, don't be like that.

37:50.393 --> 37:51.644
Or what?

37:51.644 --> 37:54.313
You gonna get us sent
to some more retraining?

37:55.022 --> 37:56.232
Shit.

37:58.317 --> 37:59.485
What the hell?

37:59.485 --> 38:01.070
My bad.

38:01.904 --> 38:03.781
Let me dry you off.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.453
<i>‚ô™ Woo-hoo ‚ô™</i>

38:09.453 --> 38:11.455
<i>‚ô™ When I feel heavy metal ‚ô™</i>

38:11.455 --> 38:12.915
<i>‚ô™ Woo-hoo ‚ô™</i>

38:13.749 --> 38:14.875
Go.

38:16.085 --> 38:17.086
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

38:17.086 --> 38:19.547
I just hate all this macho nonsense.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.133
- Want to get out of here?
- I'd love to.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.050
Okay.

38:24.343 --> 38:25.344
<i>‚ô™ Yeah, yeah ‚ô™</i>

38:27.471 --> 38:29.181
<i>‚ô™ Yeah, yeah ‚ô™</i>

38:29.181 --> 38:30.641
Thank you.

38:31.767 --> 38:32.935
<i>‚ô™ Oh, yeah ‚ô™</i>

38:34.603 --> 38:37.523
Be careful. That's an original Kelvin.

38:38.441 --> 38:40.067
Final delivery has arrived.

38:51.412 --> 38:52.413
It's perfect.

38:56.876 --> 38:58.377
I need a doctor.

38:58.377 --> 39:00.087
Like everyone else here.

39:00.880 --> 39:01.714
Take a seat.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.181
Dear Lord.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.809
Get her to Gastroenterology now!

39:18.147 --> 39:20.149
Sorry for the dirty squirties.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.245
<i>ID.</i>

39:33.996 --> 39:37.041
<i>What is the purpose of your visit,
Miss Flores?</i>

39:37.792 --> 39:39.085
<i>Business or pleasure?</i>

39:39.627 --> 39:42.171
<i>It isn't business.</i>

39:44.131 --> 39:45.007
<i>All good.</i>

39:47.218 --> 39:48.511
She's heading inside.

39:52.556 --> 39:54.725
- Roo, what's the holdup?
-  <i>Cut me a break.</i>

39:54.725 --> 39:57.019
There's a whole quart of goulash
up my crack.

39:59.980 --> 40:01.065
<i>Better hurry, Roo.</i>

40:01.065 --> 40:04.568
We can't find a CCTV feed in the hospital,
so I have no eyes on the hallway.

40:04.568 --> 40:07.405
Please. This whole country
is socialized medicine.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.322
It'll be hours

40:08.322 --> 40:10.574
- before some quack comes in here.

40:12.910 --> 40:13.744
What's up, doc?

40:16.372 --> 40:17.623
You weren't lying.

40:17.623 --> 40:20.042
The flowers are beautiful.

40:20.626 --> 40:21.877
And that flagpole,

40:22.545 --> 40:24.296
how patriotic.

40:24.296 --> 40:26.715
Looks brand-new, not a mark on it.

40:29.343 --> 40:30.302
Everything okay?

40:31.679 --> 40:32.513
Yeah.

40:34.515 --> 40:36.100
Why can't I hear Emma on comms?

40:36.100 --> 40:39.061
There seems to be interference.
Let me see if I can boost the signal.

40:42.189 --> 40:43.983
I'm gonna get her.
That's it, and that's all.

40:44.567 --> 40:45.609
<i>Negatory, boss.</i>

40:45.609 --> 40:48.195
Guard's got a PKM, 650 rounds per minute.

40:48.195 --> 40:49.738
You'd be Swiss cheese.

40:49.738 --> 40:51.449
Barry, can you get a connection?

40:51.449 --> 40:52.992
I'm cycling channels.

40:53.701 --> 40:54.994
- Anything?
- No.

40:54.994 --> 40:57.455
Doesn't make any sense.
It's like we're sealed off.

40:58.247 --> 40:59.081
Or maybe <i>they</i> are.

40:59.081 --> 41:00.875
When Dr. Novac was nabbed in Ireland,

41:00.875 --> 41:03.419
the Moldovan government
must've boosted security in the dorms

41:03.419 --> 41:04.670
with a digital Faraday cage.

41:04.670 --> 41:06.088
- A what cage?
<i>-</i> <i>Faraday.</i>

41:06.088 --> 41:08.299
A digital mesh
that no signal can even get through.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.842
<i>That's why we can't hear Emma.</i>

41:09.842 --> 41:10.885
I doubt she can hear us.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.261
<i>She's flying blind.</i>

41:12.261 --> 41:14.638
That's why Roo
needs to take the damn shot.

41:14.638 --> 41:16.599
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

41:17.099 --> 41:20.478
Listen, Dr. Zhivago, either I bash you
in the head until you're out cold,

41:20.478 --> 41:22.730
or you inject yourself
with 40 cc's of night-night.

41:27.359 --> 41:30.321
There you go, sleepytime tea.
Put it in you.

41:32.865 --> 41:34.200
Come on.

41:41.832 --> 41:42.917
Getting in position.

41:50.049 --> 41:51.634
I'm working my angles.

41:51.634 --> 41:53.093
You mark the spot, boomer.

42:10.152 --> 42:11.570
Did you hear something?

42:13.239 --> 42:15.449
No... but I would love to.

42:16.242 --> 42:19.203
What do you have that would... set the mood?

42:20.913 --> 42:22.039
Just the thing.

42:23.707 --> 42:25.709
And we have video.

42:25.709 --> 42:29.004
This... is my favorite song.

42:31.590 --> 42:33.592
<i>‚ô™ Lightning crashes ‚ô™</i>

42:33.592 --> 42:34.677
And audio.

42:34.677 --> 42:37.096
'90s emo rock.

42:37.096 --> 42:38.639
- Called it.

42:38.639 --> 42:40.975
We have eyes and ears
on everything but the bedroom.

42:40.975 --> 42:42.226
We don't need the bedroom.

42:42.226 --> 42:45.062
She collects the data
and get the hell out of there. That's it.

42:45.062 --> 42:47.773
<i>‚ô™ ...falls to the floor ‚ô™</i>

42:55.864 --> 42:58.158
Emma's doing a great job
of getting data from Nik's laptop,

42:58.158 --> 43:00.327
but the Faraday cage
won't let that data be sent to me.

43:00.911 --> 43:03.455
I have no idea if she downloaded
Dr. Novac's research paper

43:03.455 --> 43:04.707
or his grocery list.

43:04.707 --> 43:06.083
Look, I know Emma.

43:06.083 --> 43:09.461
She's not gonna leave before she knows
for sure that the job is done.

43:09.461 --> 43:12.423
The only way she knows that
is if she gets our confirmation.

43:12.423 --> 43:15.593
- So we must turn off the cage.
-  <i>I'd advise against that, sir.</i>

43:15.593 --> 43:17.595
If they went through the trouble
of setting up that cage,

43:17.595 --> 43:19.096
they definitely put an alarm on it.

43:19.096 --> 43:22.391
Shut it off, the alarm sounds,
and then the dorm goes into lockdown.

43:22.391 --> 43:24.435
Emma got past the guard
with her credentials,

43:24.435 --> 43:26.353
but she'll get busted
if they do a deep dive.

43:26.353 --> 43:27.855
Hold on.

43:28.355 --> 43:30.524
You said the Faraday cage
is like a digital mesh, right?

43:30.524 --> 43:31.984
- Mm-hm.
- Mesh comes in all sizes.

43:31.984 --> 43:33.068
Tight like a screen door,

43:33.068 --> 43:35.362
or loose and more revealing
like a sexy crop top.

43:35.362 --> 43:36.655
And the point is?

43:36.655 --> 43:39.992
The cage requires a ton of power,
meaning it'd have a dedicated line.

43:39.992 --> 43:42.953
We tap into it, we can dim the power
without cutting it off.

43:42.953 --> 43:44.121
We weaken the mesh

43:44.121 --> 43:46.790
so we can get our comms through to Emma
without tripping the alarm.

43:46.790 --> 43:48.959
The mesh is there
but provides no protection.

43:48.959 --> 43:49.960
Exactly.

43:51.045 --> 43:52.046
Found the power line.

43:52.630 --> 43:54.798
Now it looks like they dug a trench
and ran a conduit

43:54.798 --> 43:57.009
to an electrical tower several miles away.

43:57.009 --> 43:58.761
<i>If it's standard PVC,
it won't be that deep,</i>

43:58.761 --> 44:00.929
<i>so you should be able
to easily compromise it.</i>

44:00.929 --> 44:03.015
<i>It's only ten yards west of you.</i>

44:03.015 --> 44:04.266
- Found it.
<i>-</i> <i>Get digging.</i>

44:04.266 --> 44:06.226
You'll need two holes, six inches apart.

44:08.979 --> 44:10.022
Here you go.

44:11.565 --> 44:12.524
Thank you.

44:13.359 --> 44:14.735
Yeah.

44:15.778 --> 44:17.571
-<i>Salut.
- Salut.</i>

44:20.074 --> 44:20.908
Mm.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.164
You're so aggressive.

44:43.889 --> 44:45.432
Start digging the second hole.

44:48.394 --> 44:49.937
Yes. Okay.

44:54.775 --> 44:58.320
This is very uncomfortable.
I took her to see the <i>Jimmy Neutron</i> movie.

44:58.320 --> 44:59.780
Man, she's a good kisser though.

44:59.780 --> 45:02.533
I don't need to hear all this crap.
Is Emma in position?

45:03.659 --> 45:05.077
She's in a position.

45:05.077 --> 45:06.787
Is she close to Nik's device or not?

45:06.787 --> 45:07.705
From what I can see,

45:07.705 --> 45:09.248
she just downloaded the last device
in the room,

45:09.248 --> 45:11.542
but until that cage is down,
I have no idea what she got us.

45:13.210 --> 45:15.462
Whoa, whoa. Sorry.

45:16.922 --> 45:20.551
I am, how do they say,
all of the thumbs, huh?

45:21.969 --> 45:24.513
Oh,
I think you knocked your phone off the--

45:25.013 --> 45:25.848
What is this?

45:27.683 --> 45:28.517
<i>Jam Slam?</i>

45:29.518 --> 45:32.730
I've heard of it,
but, uh, Western games are frowned upon.

45:33.230 --> 45:34.815
Your phone sent you a memory.

45:37.276 --> 45:38.110
Who is this?

45:43.198 --> 45:44.450
That's my brother.

45:44.950 --> 45:47.035
He's a little slow.

45:47.661 --> 45:49.747
Uh, why in English?

45:56.378 --> 45:59.214
He lives in Boston now.
There's a special school for him there.

46:00.340 --> 46:01.175
Huh.

46:01.925 --> 46:04.052
- I'm gonna freshen up.
- Oh yeah.

46:04.052 --> 46:06.680
I'll just play for a bit while I wait.

46:06.680 --> 46:07.931
Oh, okay.

46:24.823 --> 46:25.908
I'm sorry, Carter.

46:31.079 --> 46:31.997
Seriously?

46:31.997 --> 46:33.499
I found the PVC pipe.

46:36.585 --> 46:38.629
Okay, we can see the power lines.
Now what?

46:38.629 --> 46:40.714
<i>You need to create a resistor,
a metal arch.</i>

46:40.714 --> 46:43.884
Place its two ends into the hole
so that they touch the power line.

46:44.468 --> 46:45.302
Where are we?

46:45.302 --> 46:48.472
- I need a spare tire and an antenna. Now.
- Got it.

46:52.476 --> 46:53.769
Here we go.

46:53.769 --> 46:56.522
All right, grounded, and ready to connect.

46:56.522 --> 46:58.315
Sounds like my Tinder profile.

47:02.861 --> 47:04.029
Success.

47:04.029 --> 47:05.155
Faraday cage weakened,

47:05.155 --> 47:06.573
<i>data is being accessed,</i>

47:06.573 --> 47:08.617
signals are coming in and out of the door.

47:08.617 --> 47:12.412
Uncle Barry, where have you guys been?
Did we get Dr. Novac's research?

47:12.412 --> 47:13.831
Sorting through the data now.

47:14.414 --> 47:17.334
Uh, grant applications, expense reports...

47:18.585 --> 47:19.545
Oh boy.

47:21.046 --> 47:22.506
Why do I hear hanky-panky?

47:22.506 --> 47:23.632
Um,

47:23.632 --> 47:25.843
Nik has an assortment of spanking videos.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.678
- It's getting hot.
- Gross.

47:27.678 --> 47:31.390
- What? The antenna is getting really hot.
-  <i>You're still holding on to it?</i>

47:31.390 --> 47:33.225
It has thousands of watts
running through it.

47:33.225 --> 47:34.643
- Let go.
<i>-</i> <i>I can't.</i>

47:34.643 --> 47:35.769
The holes are too big.

47:35.769 --> 47:38.230
If I let go, it tilts,
and it sets off the alarm,

47:38.230 --> 47:39.648
and Emma goes to the gulag.

47:39.648 --> 47:41.984
Let go, man.
It's starting to smell like Whoppers.

47:41.984 --> 47:44.945
No, I'm gonna hold on to it.
That's it, and that's all.

47:44.945 --> 47:46.655
Come on, help me pack the holes.

47:48.156 --> 47:50.242
Hate to pile on, guys,
but we've got bigger problems.

47:50.242 --> 47:52.035
Nik's gotta be
some kind of video game prodigy

47:52.035 --> 47:53.412
because he just reached level seven.

47:53.996 --> 47:55.539
You gotta stop him
before he beats level seven.

47:55.539 --> 47:59.001
After that, the game facade ends,
and it reverts back to spy software.

47:59.001 --> 48:00.002
What? Why?

48:00.002 --> 48:02.588
The app takes up lots of gigs.
We only had room for a few levels.

48:03.463 --> 48:05.299
<i>Emma, listen to me.</i>

48:05.966 --> 48:08.218
You gotta make him
not wanna look at that game.

48:09.386 --> 48:10.429
Shock and awe.

48:11.013 --> 48:11.930
Shock and awe.

48:11.930 --> 48:13.265
What's shock and awe?

48:13.765 --> 48:16.143
- Fluff me.
- What?

48:16.977 --> 48:19.271
That is shock and awe.

48:21.857 --> 48:22.691
Oh.

48:23.191 --> 48:24.776
How's the game going?

48:24.776 --> 48:25.694
It's...

48:36.538 --> 48:39.291
Great job, Emma. Just hang tight
till we figure out our next move, okay?

48:40.042 --> 48:41.001
Almost done?

48:41.001 --> 48:43.879
- I can't hold on to it much longer.
-  I got you. I got you.

48:43.879 --> 48:44.796
Hold on.

48:44.796 --> 48:47.007
-  We're packed pretty tight here.
-  Got it.

48:47.007 --> 48:48.467
We're ready to give it a shot.

48:50.886 --> 48:52.846
Okay, Barry, give me good news.

48:52.846 --> 48:55.766
Connection is stable,
but we still need Dr. Novac's paper.

48:55.766 --> 48:58.560
Nik must have a hard copy somewhere.
Probably in a safe?

48:58.560 --> 49:01.021
<i>Statistically, most people
keep safes in their bedroom.</i>

49:01.021 --> 49:02.272
No, no. No way.

49:03.231 --> 49:04.650
Shall we take this to the bedroom?

49:05.400 --> 49:06.318
Yes.

49:08.153 --> 49:10.489
How's Princess supposed to find
a hidden safe in the bedroom

49:10.489 --> 49:11.406
with Nik in there?

49:15.744 --> 49:18.580
Yes! Yes! Yes!

49:18.580 --> 49:19.915
- No!
<i>-</i> <i>Yes!</i>

49:19.915 --> 49:20.999
No! No!

49:20.999 --> 49:22.125
Oh yes!

49:22.793 --> 49:24.544
Yes! Yes!

49:27.214 --> 49:28.715
New wainscoting.

49:28.715 --> 49:29.841
What did you say?

49:30.509 --> 49:32.636
- I didn't say you could talk.
- Okay.

49:33.261 --> 49:35.430
Since when do Soviet-era block buildings
get makeovers?

49:35.430 --> 49:37.182
It's gotta be the facade for the safe.

49:37.182 --> 49:39.142
Knock the guy out and break in.

49:39.142 --> 49:41.186
Then if he wakes up,
he knows he's been robbed,

49:41.186 --> 49:44.147
tells his superiors, word gets out
that Novac's handler's been ambushed,

49:44.147 --> 49:46.316
Boro finds out,
he knows that we're onto him,

49:46.316 --> 49:47.901
pivots, he's gone forever.

49:47.901 --> 49:50.779
Just stay tight, sweetie, okay?

49:50.779 --> 49:52.531
We're gonna come up with a plan.

49:55.283 --> 49:56.284
Emma?

49:57.411 --> 49:58.245
Emma?

49:59.246 --> 50:00.580
Barry, is the cage up again?

50:00.580 --> 50:01.581
No.

50:01.581 --> 50:06.294
Um... it appears Emma has removed her comms.

50:06.294 --> 50:10.590
Communication has unilaterally been cut
just like she did in Guyana.

50:10.590 --> 50:11.967
Why would she take out the comm?

50:11.967 --> 50:13.135
Um...

50:13.135 --> 50:14.094
Hm...

50:14.094 --> 50:15.762
Why would Emma take out the comm?

50:50.464 --> 50:52.841
I found the safe.
Nik's out cold.

50:52.841 --> 50:55.844
Please tell me that you poisoned him.

51:31.296 --> 51:33.090
The paper, I've got it.

51:41.765 --> 51:43.141
Who do you work for?
