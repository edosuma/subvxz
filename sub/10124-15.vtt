00:08.667 --> 00:09.900
"AT TODD'S PLACE.

00:09.900 --> 00:10.900
COUPLES ONLY."

00:10.900 --> 00:12.133
SHAWN, THAT'S
DISCRIMINATION.

00:12.133 --> 00:14.500
IT LEAVES OUT
A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:14.500 --> 00:16.500
COMMITTED
TO THE SINGLE LIFE--

00:16.500 --> 00:18.600
PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME.

00:19.834 --> 00:20.834
HUH?

00:20.834 --> 00:22.600
PEOPLE LIKE ME.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.667
REMEMBER IN HEALTH CLASS,

00:23.667 --> 00:26.900
THAT SECTION
ON THE MOVEMENT OF BLOOD?

00:26.900 --> 00:28.600
I UNDERSTAND IT NOW.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.100
FINE. BAIL
ON YOUR BEST FRIEND.

00:31.100 --> 00:34.900
CORY, JUST ASK A GIRL,
AND YOU CAN GO, TOO.

00:34.900 --> 00:35.967
LOOK, THERE'S WENDY.

00:35.967 --> 00:39.100
YOU LIKE HER. ASK HER
TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

00:39.100 --> 00:41.967
JUST FOR THE PARTY?
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

00:41.967 --> 00:43.600
YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.967
YOU'RE THINKING
TOO MUCH.

00:44.967 --> 00:47.700
DO WHAT I DO--
DON'T THINK.

00:51.734 --> 00:52.734
WENDY, HI.

00:52.734 --> 00:54.000
OH, HI, CORY.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.500
UH, LISTEN,
STEPHANIE AND TODD
ARE HAVING THIS PARTY,

00:57.500 --> 01:00.133
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'D GO WITH ME.

01:00.133 --> 01:03.500
WELL, CORY,
THIS INVITATION
SAYS COUPLES ONLY.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.500
OH. THAT.

01:04.500 --> 01:07.567
WELL, IF WE WENT
TO THE PARTY
TOGETHER,

01:07.567 --> 01:08.600
WE'D BE A COUPLE.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.967
YOU'RE JUST LOOKING
FOR A DATE.

01:10.967 --> 01:13.100
NO. I'D LIKE
TO GO WITH YOU.

01:13.100 --> 01:15.200
YOU WANT TO BE
A COUPLE?

01:15.200 --> 01:16.500
SURE.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.367
YOU DO?

01:18.367 --> 01:20.400
YEAH. I DO.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.400
I DO, TOO.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.800
THIS IS WONDERFUL,
CORY.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.467
IS IT O.K.
IF I TELL MY FRIENDS?

01:26.467 --> 01:30.967
SURE. AND I'LL
TELL ALL OF MINE.

01:30.967 --> 01:32.400
SHAWN!

01:32.400 --> 01:36.934
HEY, LOOK AT ME.
I'M A COUPLE.

01:36.934 --> 01:37.967
LOOK AT ME. I'M ALONE.

01:37.967 --> 01:40.900
YOU WILL BE
UNTIL THESE GRADES
COME UP.

01:40.900 --> 01:41.900
UNTIL I SEE LETTERS

01:41.900 --> 01:44.233
CLOSER TO THE FRONT
OF THE ALPHABET,

01:44.233 --> 01:47.500
YOU'RE NOT GOING OUT
ON ANY MORE DATES.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.767
MOM. MOMMY.

01:49.767 --> 01:52.667
OH, ALAN,
HOW CAN YOU BE SO CRUEL

01:52.667 --> 01:55.300
TO MY SWEET
LITTLE BABY?

01:55.300 --> 01:58.400
WELL,
IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.734
YOU CAN'T RELY ON LOOKS
TO GET THROUGH LIFE.

02:01.734 --> 02:04.300
ALL I WANT TO BE
IS A WEATHERMAN.

02:04.300 --> 02:06.767
YOU MADE A VALID POINT
ABOUT MY GRADES,

02:06.767 --> 02:09.700
BUT NOW I'D LIKE TO PRESENT
A COUNTER-ARGUMENT

02:09.700 --> 02:11.100
YOU MAY NOT HAVE CONSIDERED.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.133
GO AHEAD.

02:12.133 --> 02:15.467
DON'T TAKE AWAY MY GIRLS!
YOU CAN'T!

02:24.500 --> 02:26.100
CORY.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.400
OH, WENDY. HI.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.734
I WANTED TO TELL YOU

02:29.734 --> 02:31.233
THAT SPENDING TIME
WITH YOU,

02:31.233 --> 02:34.200
IT'S BEEN THE BEST
WEEK OF MY LIFE.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.400
MINE, TOO.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.400
SEE YOU.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.400
OH.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.900
WAIT, SILLY BILLY.

02:38.900 --> 02:40.033
I WANTED TO ASK YOU,

02:40.033 --> 02:42.767
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA
BE THIS SUMMER?

02:42.767 --> 02:44.567
UH, SUMMER?
I DON'T KNOW.

02:44.567 --> 02:45.800
IT'S SO FAR OFF.
WHY?

02:45.800 --> 02:47.000
SINCE WE'RE A COUPLE,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.567
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO SPENDING SUMMER
TOGETHER.

02:49.567 --> 02:54.033
WHY DON'T WE WAIT
AND SEE HOW THE SPRING
GOES FIRST?

02:54.033 --> 02:55.033
O.K.

02:55.033 --> 02:58.100
YOU KNOW, SPRING
IS WHEN LOVE BLOOMS.

02:58.100 --> 03:01.567
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.
THANK YOU.

[BELL RINGS]

03:02.600 --> 03:05.367
LISTEN, CAN WE TALK
LATER? I'VE GOT--

03:05.367 --> 03:06.367
CHEMISTRY.

03:06.367 --> 03:07.467
YEAH.

03:07.467 --> 03:10.667
BOY, YOU KNOW
MY SCHEDULE
BETTER THAN ME.

03:10.667 --> 03:13.100
YOU'RE SO CUTE.

03:13.100 --> 03:14.967
NOW,
STRAIGHTEN YOUR COLLAR,

03:14.967 --> 03:18.000
AND OFF YOU GO.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.400
UH, CORY,

03:19.400 --> 03:22.233
DIDN'T YOU
FORGET SOMETHING?

03:25.200 --> 03:28.233
NO, GOOSE. KISS-KISS.

03:36.867 --> 03:38.133
OH, MR. TURNER, REMEMBER,

03:38.133 --> 03:40.300
MIDTERM GRADES
ARE DUE NEXT FRIDAY.

03:40.300 --> 03:41.867
I THOUGHT I'D
GIVE EVERYBODY As.

03:41.867 --> 03:45.400
PARENTS ARE HAPPY,
KIDS ARE HAPPY,
NOBODY GETS HURT.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.500
HURT THEM.

03:46.500 --> 03:50.500
YOU KNOW, I WAS
A SQUASH PLAYER
IN MY DAY.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.600
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH RACQUETBALL?

03:53.600 --> 03:56.400
OH. OF COURSE.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.934
MY GOODNESS.
I GUESS I'M OUT OF TOUCH

03:58.934 --> 04:01.033
WITH CURRENT
RECREATIONAL SPORTS.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.300
ACTUALLY,
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN

04:02.300 --> 04:04.734
FROM OLD ENGRAVINGS
ON THE HISTORY CHANNEL,

04:04.734 --> 04:06.734
SQUASH AND RACQUETBALL
ARE QUITE SIMILAR.

04:06.734 --> 04:09.133
REALLY?
SAME BASIC PRINCIPLE?

04:09.133 --> 04:12.467
YEAH. I'M SURE YOU'D
PICK IT UP IN NO TIME.

04:12.467 --> 04:15.734
I'D LIKE TO GET
IN STEP WITH THE TIMES.

04:15.734 --> 04:16.767
HOW ABOUT TOMORROW

04:16.767 --> 04:19.133
I TAKE YOU OUT
AND SHOW YOU HOW?

04:19.133 --> 04:21.467
THAT'LL GIVE YOU TIME
TO GET A DOCTOR'S NOTE.

04:24.100 --> 04:26.700
YOU'RE A FUNNY GUY.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.033
YOU THINK THERE'S ROOM
FOR MY RESPIRATOR?

04:32.700 --> 04:34.900
WHAT A CHUMP.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.200
HI, ERIC.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.800
ERIC, IT'S ME--
LORI.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.400
I KNOW WHO IT IS.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.934
BE KIND AND MOVE ON.

04:45.934 --> 04:48.200
MY PARENTS
ARE OUT OF TOWN.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.300
I'VE
BEEN HAVING TROUBLE

04:49.300 --> 04:51.667
ADJUSTING
THE TEMPERATURE
ON MY HOT TUB.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.600
I WONDERED
IF YOU'D COME OVER

04:53.600 --> 04:55.900
AND HELP ME
GET THE HEAT UP.

04:55.900 --> 04:58.500
IF YOU HAD
ANY FEELINGS FOR ME,

04:58.500 --> 05:00.200
GO HOME, GET UGLY.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.100
O.K. I'LL ASK PHIL.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.734
LOCKER HEAD MAN.
I HEARD YOUR SIGNAL

05:08.734 --> 05:11.033
AND CAME AS QUICKLY
AS I COULD.

05:11.033 --> 05:12.133
JASON, I'M GOING NUTS.

05:12.133 --> 05:15.600
THE MORE I STUDY, THE MORE
I THINK ABOUT GIRLS.

05:15.600 --> 05:16.867
LOOK. HISTORY?
PERFECT EXAMPLE.

05:16.867 --> 05:20.600
QUEEN VICTORIA,
CATHERINE THE GREAT,
MADAME CURIE.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.767
ARE THEY YUMMY OR WHAT?

05:22.767 --> 05:24.467
YUMMY.

05:24.467 --> 05:29.400
OH, AND WHO IS THIS
RAVEN-HAIRED BEAUTY?

05:29.400 --> 05:32.800
THAT'S
LEONARDO da VINCI.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.400
STOP THAT.
YOU'RE SCARING ME.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.800
COME HERE.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.100

05:37.100 --> 05:38.734

ACCEPTABLE,

05:38.734 --> 05:42.400

05:42.400 --> 05:44.400
THERE'S NO SUCH THING.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.600
ALL RIGHT.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.200
TELL ME!

05:47.200 --> 05:49.967
A HAIRCUT? THAT'S
YOUR GIRL SUBSTITUTE?

05:49.967 --> 05:53.100
IF I WAS STARVING,
WOULD YOU BUY ME PANTS?

05:53.100 --> 05:55.834
THANK YOU, BUT I
DON'T NEED A HAIRCUT.

05:55.834 --> 05:57.800
I THINK
YOU NEED A HAIRCUT

05:57.800 --> 06:00.233
MORE THAN YOU
NEED ANYTHING.

06:00.233 --> 06:01.233
WHY?

06:01.233 --> 06:02.667
HELLO, JASON.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.500

07:01.033 --> 07:03.033
HELP ME WITH MY
ENGLISH HOMEWORK?

07:03.033 --> 07:05.467
SORRY.
I CAN'T TONIGHT.

07:05.467 --> 07:06.700
OH.

07:06.700 --> 07:09.033
WHAT'S WITH THE GIRLS
IN ENGLISH CLASS?

07:09.033 --> 07:12.300
THAT'S THE FIFTH ONE
WHO'S ASKED ME FOR HELP.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.734
COR, ARE YOU
THAT CLUELESS?

07:13.734 --> 07:17.500
CLUELESS?
OBVIOUSLY I KNOW
WHAT THE HOMEWORK IS.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.767
THEY DON'T WANT HOMEWORK.
THEY WANT YOU.

07:20.767 --> 07:21.767
WHY?

07:21.767 --> 07:22.867
BECAUSE YOU'RE A COUPLE.

07:22.867 --> 07:25.500
THEY CAN'T HAVE YOU,
THEY WANT YOU MORE.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.133
WHAT SENSE
DOES THAT MAKE?

07:27.133 --> 07:29.867
YOU'RE HOT.
USE IT. GO FOR IT.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.400
BUT
WHAT ABOUT WENDY?

07:31.400 --> 07:33.200
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU DATED?

07:33.200 --> 07:34.567
ABOUT A WEEK.

07:34.567 --> 07:36.600
OH, BREAK UP!

07:36.600 --> 07:38.200
WHY? WENDY'S SO CUTE.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.000
SHE'S ADORABLE.
SHE LIKES ME.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.767
YOU ARE SO SUPERFICIAL.

07:42.767 --> 07:45.200
END IT THIS MINUTE.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.300
WHY?

07:46.300 --> 07:47.767
BECAUSE
A WEEK'S TOO LONG

07:47.767 --> 07:48.967
TO DATE
THE SAME PERSON.

07:48.967 --> 07:51.367
SHE WAITS FOR YOU,
SHE KNOWS YOUR SCHEDULE.

07:51.367 --> 07:54.000
I'VE HEARD OF A GIRL
WHO WANTED TO KNOW

07:54.000 --> 07:57.367
WHAT THE GUY WAS
DOING NEXT SUMMER.

07:57.367 --> 08:01.100
WHAT A LOSER.

08:01.100 --> 08:03.100
SO, YOU GOT
THE BREAK-UP NOTE?

08:03.100 --> 08:05.834
YEAH. BUT I'M WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT.

08:05.834 --> 08:07.500
SHE KNOWS
THE BREAK-UP'S COMING.

08:07.500 --> 08:10.033
SHE PROBABLY WANTS IT
MORE THAN YOU.

08:10.033 --> 08:13.934
HI, CORY.
I BOUGHT YOU SOCKS.

08:17.900 --> 08:20.133
IT'S A LOVELY
PARTING GIFT.

O.K., EVERYBODY.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.967
DO I HAVE EVERYBODY'S POEMS
ON MY DESK?

08:23.967 --> 08:24.967
THANK YOU.

08:24.967 --> 08:27.600
I THOUGHT
WE'D READ A FEW OF THEM

08:27.600 --> 08:29.767
AND DISCUSS THEM, O.K.?

08:29.767 --> 08:31.934
THE FIRST ONE UP
IS SHAWN HUNTER.

08:31.934 --> 08:34.033
HIS POEM IS CALLED
<i>WELFARE.  </i>

08:35.900 --> 08:36.967
O.K.

08:36.967 --> 08:38.567
YOU WANT ME TO READ THIS

08:38.567 --> 08:41.300
OR JUST FORWARD IT
TO THE GUIDANCE COUNSELOR?

08:41.300 --> 08:44.467
READ IT. IT'S SOME
OF MY BEST WORK.

08:44.467 --> 08:46.400
O.K., EVERYBODY.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.934
BUCKLE UP.

08:47.934 --> 08:50.200
"MY UNCLE RALPH,
HE DOES NOT CARE,

08:50.200 --> 08:52.200
'CAUSE TWICE A MONTH
HE GETS WELFARE."

08:53.900 --> 08:55.400
"MY UNCLE CHUCK
HAS NYLON HAIR.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.967
HE BOUGHT THE RUG
WITH HIS WELFARE."

08:59.600 --> 09:04.133
"OLD CORVAIR,
LONG NOSE HAIR,

09:04.133 --> 09:05.800

09:07.400 --> 09:09.300
THAT'S A VERY COLORFUL
FAMILY YOU GOT, SHAWN.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.300
I DIDN'T USE THEIR
REAL NAMES. O.K.?

09:11.300 --> 09:15.000
OH, YEAH. YEAH.
THE LESS I KNOW,
THE BETTER.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Give her the note.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.567
Oh. Right.

09:19.567 --> 09:20.600
O.K. MOVING ON.

09:20.600 --> 09:21.600
Psst. Wendy.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.200
HERE'S ONE WRITTEN
BY WENDY JANSEN.

09:23.200 --> 09:26.500
IT'S CALLED
<i>LEAVE ME AND I'LL DIE. </i>

09:28.100 --> 09:30.367
Wendy,
I need that back.

09:30.367 --> 09:31.467

09:31.467 --> 09:33.900

09:39.300 --> 09:40.767
"LEAVE ME AND I'LL DIE.

09:40.767 --> 09:44.100
I WILL DIE, DIE, DIE."

09:45.600 --> 09:48.500
You think I could
have the note back?

09:48.500 --> 09:50.033
OH. THE NOTE. RIGHT.

09:50.033 --> 09:51.500
NO. DON'T--

09:54.500 --> 09:58.000
MAY I...BE EXCUSED?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.100
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:01.100 --> 10:06.734
WE BOTH HAD A LOT
OF ICED TEA AT LUNCH.

10:09.934 --> 10:12.133
WENDY, I'M REALLY SORRY.

10:12.133 --> 10:14.400
THE NOTE--
I MAY NOT HAVE SAID

10:14.400 --> 10:16.967
WHAT I WAS HOPING
YOU'D THINK I MEANT.

10:16.967 --> 10:19.800
YOU MEAN YOU DON'T
WANT TO BREAK UP?

10:19.800 --> 10:20.800
NO.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.367
I MEAN, WELL, WHAT
GAVE YOU THAT IDEA?

10:24.367 --> 10:27.867
"I THINK
WE SHOULD BREAK UP."

10:27.867 --> 10:31.300
SHOULD NOT. SEE? NOT.

10:31.300 --> 10:37.100
IS THIS THE FACE OF A GUY
WHO WANTS TO BREAK UP?

10:37.100 --> 10:39.567
I JUST LOVE YOUR FACE.

10:39.567 --> 10:40.800
YOU DO?

10:40.800 --> 10:41.800
YES.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.667
THEN EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE O.K.?

10:44.667 --> 10:47.467
WELL, I NEED A HUG.

10:50.100 --> 10:55.700
I HOPE OUR KIDS TURN OUT
AS SENSITIVE AS YOU.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.300
ME, TOO.

10:59.133 --> 11:01.100
OUR WHAT?

11:08.300 --> 11:10.800
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT
BREAK UP WITH WENDY?

11:10.800 --> 11:12.800
NO,
BUT I HAVE A PLAN.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.600
I'LL CALL HER
AND TELL HER

11:14.600 --> 11:16.600
THINGS ARE MOVING
A LITTLE FAST

11:16.600 --> 11:19.367
AND I NEED A FEW
DAYS BY MYSELF.

11:19.367 --> 11:21.567
HOW COULD IT NOT WORK?

11:21.567 --> 11:22.600
HI, CORY.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.033
[GASP]
[GASP]

11:25.033 --> 11:27.900
HEY, CORY,
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

11:27.900 --> 11:31.200
IT'S WENDY. AND SHE'S
HOLDING A KNIFE.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.834
GUESS WHO'S FIXING US
DINNER TONIGHT.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.400
HONEY,
THESE ARE TERRIFIC
SCALLOPED POTATOES.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.934
I MENTIONED TO WENDY
THEY WERE CORY'S FAVORITE,

11:42.934 --> 11:45.133
AND SHE WHIPPED THEM UP
FROM SCRATCH.

11:45.133 --> 11:48.200
I COULD SHOW YOU
HOW TO MAKE THEM.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.467
I'M SURE
I'D LIKE THAT.

11:49.467 --> 11:52.834
IN FACT, WHY DON'T WE
INVITE WENDY TO MOVE IN?

11:52.834 --> 11:56.734
AND WE COULD BECOME ONE
BIG, POTATO-EATING FAMILY.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.200
WELL, I DON'T JUST
MAKE POTATOES, CORY.

12:00.200 --> 12:03.700
I CAN MAKE FUN STUFF
LIKE BELGIAN WAFFLES.

12:03.700 --> 12:07.400
WITH WHIPPED CREAM
AND STRAWBERRIES?

12:07.400 --> 12:09.100
WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.200
OOH.

12:11.934 --> 12:14.000
MY GRANDMOTHER MAKES THEM
FOR MY GRANDFATHER.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.033
THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER
66 YEARS.

12:16.033 --> 12:21.300
I'M ON AN EMOTIONAL
ROLLER COASTER.

12:21.300 --> 12:22.467
SHE HAVE AN OPENING
TOMORROW?

12:22.467 --> 12:23.467
I CAN CALL.

12:23.467 --> 12:24.467
CALL NOW.

12:24.467 --> 12:25.767
HEY, GUYS.
WHERE YOU BEEN?

12:25.767 --> 12:30.667
I CAN GET AS MANY
HAIRCUTS AS I WANT!

12:30.667 --> 12:35.700
ERIC IS TO--CUT--
LET'S GO.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.033
HOW BAD IS THIS?

12:37.033 --> 12:39.934
UH, LET ME FINISH DINNER.
THEN I'LL ASSESS.

12:39.934 --> 12:41.934
THE WELL-GROOMED BOY
THERE WAS--

12:41.934 --> 12:43.967
ERIC.
AND HIS FRIEND JASON.

12:43.967 --> 12:47.500
CORY'S TOLD ME
SO MUCH ABOUT HIM.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.100
WHEN?

12:50.100 --> 12:52.233
I HOPE OUR THREE KIDS
TURN OUT

12:52.233 --> 12:54.600
AS WONDERFULLY
AS YOURS HAVE.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.200
Y-YOU'VE DECIDED
ON THREE CHILDREN?

13:00.200 --> 13:01.667
I'M ONE OF THREE
CHILDREN,

13:01.667 --> 13:03.233
AND CORY'S
ONE OF THREE CHILDREN,

13:03.233 --> 13:05.867
SO I THOUGHT WE'D
KEEP THE TRADITION ALIVE.

13:05.867 --> 13:10.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT, GRAMPS?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
UM...

13:11.000 --> 13:14.200
UH, COULD YOU, UH,
COME, CORY, WITH ME?

13:14.200 --> 13:15.867
UH, OVER...

13:20.400 --> 13:21.734
NUT CASE?

13:21.734 --> 13:23.367
YOU THINK?

13:25.100 --> 13:27.934
UH, UH, WENDY,

13:27.934 --> 13:29.500
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT, UH,

13:29.500 --> 13:32.367
THREE CHILDREN
ON CORY'S $5.00
A WEEK ALLOWANCE

13:32.367 --> 13:35.967
MIGHT BE A LITTLE
STRESSFUL DURING
THE HOLIDAYS?

13:35.967 --> 13:39.233
MR. MATTHEWS,
WE'RE NOT GOING TO
GET MARRIED ANYTIME SOON.

13:39.233 --> 13:42.200
WE BOTH HAVE
A LOT OF GROWING UP
TO DO.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.233
WELL, I'M GLAD
TO HEAR THAT.

13:44.233 --> 13:45.300
LET HER FINISH.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.834
WE'RE JUST GOING TO
GROW UP TOGETHER.

13:47.834 --> 13:49.500
YOU WANT TO GO
OUTSIDE AGAIN?

13:49.500 --> 13:51.800
WHEN YOU AND CORY
ARE MARRIED,

13:51.800 --> 13:54.000
WILL YOU BE MY SISTER?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.100
THAT'S RIGHT.

13:55.100 --> 13:58.567
OOH, SHE'S GOT MORGAN.

13:58.567 --> 14:03.133
THAT IS JUST
SO COMPLETELY SWEET!

14:03.133 --> 14:05.834
OH, SHE'S GOT
ALL THE WOMEN.

14:07.467 --> 14:09.767
WANT TO SEE
MY DOLL, SIS?

14:09.767 --> 14:12.400
I'D LIKE THAT.
EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT.

14:12.400 --> 14:16.000
OF COURSE, DEAR.
MAKE YOURSELF
AT HOME.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.400
YEAH, MOVE IN.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.800
O.K., O.K.
FAMILY MEETING.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.233
WHAT THE HECK
DID YOU BRING HOME?

14:21.233 --> 14:23.100
<i>SHE </i>LET HER IN!

14:23.100 --> 14:26.300
COME ON.
SHE'S JUST A LITTLE
GIRL PLAYING HOUSE.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.600
SWEETHEART,
SHE'S A LITTLE
BLONDE LOON!

14:28.600 --> 14:32.300
NONSENSE! IF I
THOUGHT THERE WAS
REASON FOR CONCERN,

14:32.300 --> 14:34.500
I'D BE FIRST
TO SOUND THE ALARM.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.700
MRS. MATTHEWS,

14:35.700 --> 14:38.767
I FOUND THIS PICTURE
OF YOU IN YOUR
WEDDING DRESS.

14:38.767 --> 14:42.667
MAYBE SOME DAY
I'LL GET TO TRY IT ON.

14:42.667 --> 14:45.500
BEEP, BEEP, BEEP,
BEEP...

14:47.000 --> 14:48.300
COME ON, JONATHAN.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.667
YOUNG MINDS WAITING
TO BE TAUGHT.

14:50.667 --> 14:52.100
I'M COMING. I'M COMING.

14:52.100 --> 14:56.000
OUR LITTLE MATCH
DIDN'T TAKE IT
ALL OUT OF YOU,

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
DID IT?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.600
YEAH. YOU'RE SOME
PIECE OF WORK.

14:58.600 --> 15:02.000
"HOW WILL I ADAPT
TO THIS VASTLY
DIFFERENT GAME?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.834
"AM I STANDING
THE RIGHT WAY?

15:03.834 --> 15:06.767
OH, LOOK, ANOTHER
POINT FOR ME!"

15:06.767 --> 15:08.500
I BELIEVE IT WAS
YOUR IDEA

15:08.500 --> 15:11.700
TO MAKE A SMALL WAGER
ON THE OUTCOME.

15:11.700 --> 15:14.500
YOU WERE OLD.
I THOUGHT YOU'D LOSE!

15:14.500 --> 15:16.900
AND I CLEANED
YOUR CLOCK.

15:16.900 --> 15:19.000
SO...

15:19.000 --> 15:20.700
YEAH. YOU TOOK ME.

15:20.700 --> 15:23.300
YOU HUSTLED ME.

15:23.300 --> 15:24.300
HEE HEE HEE.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.500
YES, I DID.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
OH, BY THE WAY,
JONATHAN.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.200
I DON'T SHOOT POOL,
EITHER.

15:32.200 --> 15:35.400
HA HA HA HA!

15:35.400 --> 15:37.767
SO AFTER SHE MADE US
DESSERT AND READ TO US,

15:37.767 --> 15:41.100
I WALKED HER HOME
AND I LAID IT OUT.

15:41.100 --> 15:45.200
I SAID,
"WENDY, IT'S OVER
FOREVER."

15:45.200 --> 15:46.233
HOW'D SHE REACT?

15:46.233 --> 15:48.834
SHE INVITED ME IN
FOR OATMEAL COOKIES,

15:48.834 --> 15:50.100
GRANDMA JANSEN
PLAYED THE ORGAN,

15:50.100 --> 15:55.033
AND WE ALL SANG
<i>BIG ROCK CANDY </i>
<i>MOUNTAIN. </i>

15:55.033 --> 15:56.767
IT WAS NICE
KNOWING YOU.

15:56.767 --> 15:58.500
THEY HAVE FOUR
GENERATIONS

15:58.500 --> 16:00.600
LIVING IN
THE SAME HOUSE.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.300
THE MEN
DON'T SAY MUCH.

16:03.300 --> 16:04.500
[BELL RINGS]

16:04.500 --> 16:06.300
LISTEN, MAN,
I GOT CLASS.

16:06.300 --> 16:09.233
STAY HERE.
I'LL COME BACK
AND GET YOU.

16:09.233 --> 16:10.567
SURE YOU'RE O.K.?

16:10.567 --> 16:12.400
YES, DEAR.
I'M VERY HAPPY.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.500
I DON'T HAVE TO
THINK ABOUT ANYTHING

16:15.500 --> 16:18.300
FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE.

16:21.300 --> 16:24.233
CORY, SWEETHEART,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:24.233 --> 16:25.400
WHAT?

16:25.400 --> 16:27.667
WE DON'T HAVE TO
STEAL THE DINNER
ROLLS.

16:27.667 --> 16:30.100
THEY WANT YOU
TO TAKE THEM.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.200
NO, THEY DON'T.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.900
AT THE PRICES
THEY CHARGE,

16:32.900 --> 16:36.000
THEY'RE LUCKY
WE DON'T TAKE
THE SILVERWARE.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.400
I KNOW WHY
SOMEONE'S CRANKY.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.500
I'LL HAVE THE WAITRESS
BRING SOME PRUNES.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.300
CORY!

16:51.300 --> 16:54.233
IS THAT YOU?

16:54.233 --> 16:56.400
SHAWN, WHO ELSE
WOULD IT BE?

16:56.400 --> 16:59.500
YOU KNOW I COME HERE
EVERY DAY, 4:30,

16:59.500 --> 17:01.400
FOR THE EARLY BIRD
SPECIAL.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.500
AND EVERY DAY
YOU ASK,

17:03.500 --> 17:04.967
"CORY, IS THAT YOU?"

17:04.967 --> 17:09.300
MY MIND'S
NOT AS SHARP
AS IT USED TO BE.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.700
I GOT NEWS, SHAWN.
IT NEVER WAS.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.100
HOW'S THE FISH?

17:13.100 --> 17:15.567
NICE!

17:15.567 --> 17:18.200
SHAWN,
I USED TO ENVY YOU.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.000
SINCE WE WAS YOUNG,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.200
YOU'VE DATED
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN,

17:22.200 --> 17:24.600
AND I'VE BEEN
MARRIED TO WENDY

17:24.600 --> 17:27.200
FOR THE PAST
90 YEARS.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.400
HAS IT BEEN THAT LONG?

17:29.400 --> 17:30.967
OH, YEAH.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.000
DID YOU KNOW
THE 90th ANNIVERSARY

17:33.000 --> 17:35.600
IS THE POTATO
ANNIVERSARY?

17:35.600 --> 17:37.567
NO, I DIDN'T.

17:37.567 --> 17:41.133
HOW LONG YOU BEEN
MARRIED?

17:41.133 --> 17:42.133
WHO?

17:42.133 --> 17:43.767
WHAT?

17:43.767 --> 17:47.867
THEY WANT YOU
TO TAKE THE ROLLS!

17:50.233 --> 17:51.367
YOU AND WENDY...

17:51.367 --> 17:54.367
A BEAUTIFUL GIRL
WHO'S BEEN
BY YOUR SIDE

17:54.367 --> 17:55.600
SINCE YOU WERE 13.

17:55.600 --> 18:00.967
AND HERE I AM
AT THE TWILIGHT
OF MY LIFE, ALONE...

18:02.200 --> 18:03.567
BUT MAYBE NOT TONIGHT.

18:03.567 --> 18:05.900
I GOTTA GO.
SHE'S MOVING FAST.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.200
MISS LOCKLEAR!

18:10.734 --> 18:14.967
OH, PRUNES.
THIS SHOULD GET ME
THROUGH THE DAY.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.600
HONEY, DID YOU
MISS ME?

18:18.600 --> 18:21.967
MISS YOU?
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
OUT OF MY SIGHT

18:21.967 --> 18:23.500
FOR THE PAST
90 YEARS!

18:23.500 --> 18:26.400
CORY, HAS IT BEEN
THAT AWFUL?

18:26.400 --> 18:28.200
WENDY, AS I LOOK BACK

18:28.200 --> 18:30.367
ON OUR PAST
90 YEARS TOGETHER

18:30.367 --> 18:33.934
AND SEE HOW YOU
GAVE ME A WONDERFUL HOME,

18:33.934 --> 18:36.767
THREE OR FOUR
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN,

18:36.767 --> 18:38.467
YOUR LEFT KIDNEY,

18:38.467 --> 18:41.000
AND A PAIR OF
BEAUTIFUL SOCKS...

18:41.000 --> 18:42.200
DID YOU LIKE THEM?

18:42.200 --> 18:45.600
HAVE I EVER
TAKEN THEM OFF?

18:45.600 --> 18:47.300
NO. HA.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.367
THAT'S LOVE.

18:48.367 --> 18:52.500
SO I JUST WANNA SAY
THANK YOU FOR LOVING ME

18:52.500 --> 18:55.467
AND GIVING ME
A WONDERFUL LIFE.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.967
EMPTY YOUR POCKETS,
MR. MATTHEWS.

19:02.967 --> 19:03.967
WHAT?

19:03.967 --> 19:06.867
STEALING THE DINNER
ROLLS AGAIN.

19:08.300 --> 19:09.767
AND THE SWEET 'N' LOW.

19:09.767 --> 19:11.900
I DIDN'T TAKE
ANY SWEET 'N' LOW.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.400
WHAT'S IN THAT POCKET?

19:17.934 --> 19:20.767
I BOUGHT THESE.

19:20.767 --> 19:21.967
MR. MATTHEWS.

19:21.967 --> 19:23.400
MR. MATTHEWS!

19:23.400 --> 19:26.133
O.K., BUT I ONLY
TOOK THREE BAGS.

19:26.133 --> 19:27.133
MR. MATTHEWS!

19:27.133 --> 19:31.600
THIS IS COMING OUT OF
YOUR TIP!

19:31.600 --> 19:35.000
HERE'S A TIP FOR YOU.
GET TO CLASS.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.100
OH, I'M LATE.

19:36.100 --> 19:39.767
MY WIFE IS GONNA BE
SO UPSET!

19:41.767 --> 19:43.033
HERE'S OUR FOOD,
SWEETHEART.

19:43.033 --> 19:46.033
I DIDN'T GET
ANY CHEESE
ON OUR BURGERS

19:46.033 --> 19:48.934
BECAUSE YOU TELL ME
IT'S NO GOOD FOR ME.

19:48.934 --> 19:51.367
NO RED MEAT, EITHER.
SEE? JUST ROLLS.

19:51.367 --> 19:53.700
I JUST WANT
WHAT'S BEST
FOR YOU, CORY.

19:53.700 --> 19:56.200
YEAH, I KNOW.
YOU'RE JUST
THINKING OF ME.

19:56.200 --> 19:59.033
EVER SINCE WE FIRST
SAT IN THIS BOOTH

19:59.033 --> 20:02.400
AND YOU ASKED ME
TO BE A COUPLE
WITH YOU.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.734
THAT SEEMS FUNNY
NOW.

20:04.734 --> 20:05.734
WHY?

20:05.734 --> 20:07.800
I GUESS
IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW,

20:07.800 --> 20:09.600
BUT WHEN
I ASKED YOU OUT,

20:09.600 --> 20:12.700
I WASN'T LOOKING
FOR A LIFELONG
RELATIONSHIP.

20:12.700 --> 20:15.934
I JUST NEEDED
A DATE FOR THE PARTY.

20:15.934 --> 20:17.500
THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

20:17.500 --> 20:21.600
BUT SHAWN TOLD ME
I'M SUPPOSED TO
DATE LOTS OF GIRLS,

20:21.600 --> 20:24.300
'CAUSE THAT'S
THE RIGHT THING TO DO,

20:24.300 --> 20:26.667
AND THAT'S WHAT
GIRLS WANT, TOO.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.967
CORY, IT'S OVER.

20:28.967 --> 20:30.700
WHAT?

20:30.700 --> 20:32.600
OUR RELATIONSHIP...

20:32.600 --> 20:34.233
IS OVER.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.600
WHY?

20:35.600 --> 20:38.000
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN
BASED ON A LIE,

20:38.000 --> 20:41.200
AND THAT'S NOT
SOMETHING I WANT
TO BE PART OF.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.200
BUT WHAT ABOUT
OUR THREE KIDS?

20:43.200 --> 20:45.400
WHAT ABOUT
OUR LIFE TOGETHER

20:45.400 --> 20:47.200
AND ALL THE WAFFLES?

20:47.200 --> 20:48.800
I'M SORRY, CORY.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.467
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
ANYTHING

20:50.467 --> 20:54.867
IF IT'S NOT
SOMETHING WE BOTH
REALLY WANTED.

20:58.233 --> 21:00.867
HI.

21:00.867 --> 21:03.600
HEY, CORY, WHERE'S
WENDY GOING?

21:03.600 --> 21:05.367
WE BROKE UP.

21:05.367 --> 21:07.200
SHE LET YOU GO?

21:07.200 --> 21:08.233
YEAH. FOR GOOD.

21:08.233 --> 21:11.400
ALL RIGHT!
FREE MAN AGAIN.
ON THE PROWL.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.400
TELL YOU WHAT.
TONIGHT, YOU AND ME,

21:14.400 --> 21:15.400
THE WALLENSKI TWINS.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.900
PARTY TILL WE DROP.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

21:18.900 --> 21:20.834
NO, YOU GO.

21:20.834 --> 21:22.000
WHY?

21:22.000 --> 21:23.967
BECAUSE...

21:27.500 --> 21:30.033
I MISS WENDY.

21:39.033 --> 21:42.367
IT'S OVER!
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.000
BUT YOU'RE IN
THE BOOK.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.200
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.867
COME. SIT.

21:47.867 --> 21:52.233
WE'LL TALK
WHILE I SHAMPOO.

21:52.233 --> 21:54.367
NO, NO. DOMINIQUE,
LOOK,

21:54.367 --> 21:55.800
WHAT WE HAD WAS WRONG,

21:55.800 --> 21:58.700
AND I HAVE TO WALK OUT
WITH A DRY HEAD.

21:58.700 --> 21:59.600
BUT ONE QUICK RINSE.
NO ONE HAS TO KNOW.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.500
I'D KNOW!

22:01.500 --> 22:04.800
LOOK, DOMINIQUE,
ONE OF US HAS TO
BE STRONG.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.100
IT HAS TO BE ME.

22:06.100 --> 22:09.200
DON'T MAKE ME
DO SOMETHING
WE'LL BOTH REGRET.

22:09.200 --> 22:10.667
ERIC, YOU'RE MAKING
ME ANGRY.

22:10.667 --> 22:13.000
I WILL BE VERY
ROUGH WITH YOU.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.567
O.K.

22:16.567 --> 22:18.400
GOOD BOY.
