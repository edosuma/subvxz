09:26.391 --> 09:28.524
and they said that
he never showed up,

09:28.568 --> 09:31.048
so I ran back to the shelter
and he was gone.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.747
[sobbing] I mean, I thought
the staff was lying.

09:33.790 --> 09:37.228
You know? I thought they had,
like, reported me to DCFS

09:37.272 --> 09:40.405
for, like,
neglect or something.How long have you been sober?

09:42.625 --> 09:43.757
13 months.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.062
And before that?

09:45.106 --> 09:48.065
Well, before that,
it was really bad.

09:49.197 --> 09:52.200
I mean, Micah and I got evicted
from our apartment and--

09:52.243 --> 09:55.072
You mean, you got evicted.
He's eight.

09:55.856 --> 09:57.814
STREET: If you were
so strung out on drugs,

09:57.858 --> 09:59.207
why wasn't Micah taken
from you?

09:59.250 --> 10:01.383
I got clean before all that.

10:01.426 --> 10:05.039
I've been doing everything I can
to get us back on track.

10:05.082 --> 10:07.041
And you consider your life
to be on track now?

10:07.084 --> 10:10.435
Compared to where we were
a year ago, yeah, I do.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.222
Um, Abby, this is
security footage

10:14.265 --> 10:18.052
taken from a business
next door to the shelter.

10:18.095 --> 10:20.271
Timestamp is 2:00 a.m.

10:20.315 --> 10:21.533
Micah.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.231
Yeah.Uh...

10:23.274 --> 10:25.581
That's-that's Tony.
That's the janitor.DEACON: Right.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.497
Well, you know him as Tony,
but his real name is Liam Dunn.

10:28.540 --> 10:31.979
And he's the last person
to be seen with your boy.

10:32.022 --> 10:34.242
His real name?
Wh-- I don't understand.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.897
Liam was recently
released from prison.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.725
Prison?

10:38.768 --> 10:40.422
He was always so nice to us.

10:40.465 --> 10:43.207
Why would he do
something like this? I--

10:43.251 --> 10:44.905
It doesn't make any sense.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.908
You ask me, there's a whole lot
of this that doesn't make sense.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.954
[exhales]

10:53.740 --> 10:55.611
[exhales]

10:55.655 --> 10:58.092
Hey, Street.
Not so fast.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.749
What was your problem
in there?

11:02.792 --> 11:03.880
Seriously?

11:03.924 --> 11:05.447
You're not buying
that whole

11:05.490 --> 11:07.623
"I'm turning over
a new leaf" routine, right?

11:07.667 --> 11:09.581
I mean, she's rehearsed that bit
a hundred times before.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.496
So, where do you think
she was last night?

11:11.540 --> 11:13.281
You think she was out
getting a fix?

11:13.324 --> 11:17.198
Who leaves their eight-year-old
child in a homeless shelter

11:17.241 --> 11:19.766
to be looked after
by complete strangers?

11:19.809 --> 11:21.550
Oh, that's right.
A junkie.

11:21.593 --> 11:24.205
The same junkie who just
held hostages at gunpoint.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.250
I agree she's not
without fault.

11:26.294 --> 11:28.905
But ultimately,
she cooperated with us then.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.124
She's cooperating with us now.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.647
So, what?
She just gets a free pass?

11:31.691 --> 11:33.040
Deac,

11:33.083 --> 11:35.738
the truth is,
might be Liam

11:35.782 --> 11:37.392
that snatched Micah,
but this is on her.

11:37.435 --> 11:39.263
She just wants us
to find her son.

11:39.307 --> 11:42.136
And there's a strong possibility
that that doesn't happen.

11:42.179 --> 11:45.530
So in the meantime,
watch your tone.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.794
[exhales sharply]

11:50.405 --> 11:52.276
What's with him?I get the sense

11:52.320 --> 11:54.670
that this case is
dredging up some old issues.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.499
His mother?Yeah.
I'll keep my eye on him.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.328
All right.We got any new
intel on Liam Dunn?

12:00.371 --> 12:01.982
His criminal history has
nothing to do with

12:02.025 --> 12:03.592
trafficking or children.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.420
Well, maybe he was
never got caught.Yeah, well, maybe.

12:05.463 --> 12:07.248
But I can't shake the feeling
that we're missing something.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.337
Well, right now,
he's our only suspect.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.818
We find him,
we find Micah.Hey, Deacon?

12:11.861 --> 12:13.820
Yeah?Can I ask you something?

12:13.863 --> 12:15.822
Yeah.

12:15.865 --> 12:18.128
What's up?It's me and Nichelle.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.651
We had this weird
conversation earlier

12:19.695 --> 12:21.828
about whether or not
we were gonna baptize our kid.

12:21.871 --> 12:24.004
She wants to and you don't?

12:24.047 --> 12:25.875
Actually,
it's the opposite.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.616
She had strong
feelings about it.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.487
I mean, I knew she wasn't very
religious, but I just thought

12:29.531 --> 12:31.533
she'd have a "go with the flow"
kind of attitude about it,

12:31.576 --> 12:33.448
but that was definitely
not the case.

12:34.710 --> 12:35.842
What?

12:35.885 --> 12:37.060
No, I'm just
a little surprised that,

12:37.104 --> 12:38.453
that you'd want to.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.107
I-I know.
I understand.

12:40.150 --> 12:41.891
When was the last time
you saw me in a church?

12:41.935 --> 12:43.632
Three years ago.
Victoria's baptism.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.025
[chuckles]

12:45.068 --> 12:47.679
Why do you want to
baptize your child?

12:47.723 --> 12:49.507
I don't know, Deac.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.553
Look, I haven't kept up
with my Christian upbringing

12:51.596 --> 12:52.859
in a minute,
but, you know,

12:52.902 --> 12:55.731
I still consider myself
to be spiritual.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.385
But with a baby
on the way...

12:57.428 --> 13:00.170
I guess I'm just questioning
things a lot more these days.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.042
That's something
every new father does.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.652
But what do I do
with Nichelle?

13:03.695 --> 13:05.262
We're on opposite sides
of this one.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.047
I mean, I don't even know
that there's a middle ground.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.396
Okay, first,
you need to think why

13:08.439 --> 13:09.963
is this baptism
so important to you.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.965
And then sit on it, you know?

13:12.008 --> 13:13.880
If it's something
you decide you really want,

13:13.923 --> 13:16.970
it means a lot to you,
just talk to Nichelle.

13:18.101 --> 13:20.103
She might surprise you.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.456
According to
the kid's mother,

13:25.500 --> 13:27.632
this Liam Dunn is
a pretty decent guy,

13:27.676 --> 13:28.938
which is zero help to us.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.374
You guys learn anything
new at the shelter?

13:30.418 --> 13:32.028
Well, we talked to
the housing supervisor.

13:32.072 --> 13:33.725
At first, she was
a total deer in headlights.

13:33.769 --> 13:36.250
Seems Liam was liked by
everybody, never a problem.

13:36.293 --> 13:38.252
LUCA:But while we were there,
the supervisor discovered

13:38.295 --> 13:40.689
a stack of motel vouchers
missing from her office.

13:40.732 --> 13:43.387
And how does that trace back to
our oh-so-likable kidnapper?

13:43.431 --> 13:46.129
Janitor's the only other person
with a key to her office.

13:46.173 --> 13:49.002
So there's a good chance this
dude took the boy to a motel.

13:49.045 --> 13:50.612
Yeah, that's not
gross at all.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.744
And all these motels accept
the shelter's vouchers?

13:52.788 --> 13:54.616
Yup.All right, I want patrol out
to every one of them.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.226
Wait.
Hillwinds Inn on Van Ness.

13:56.270 --> 13:59.055
Patrol responded to an incident
there a couple hours ago.

14:00.448 --> 14:03.277
There was a brief shootout
before the gunman fled.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.801
Motel owner reported a man
and a boy at the scene.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.281
They match the descriptions
of Liam and Micah.

14:07.324 --> 14:08.935
All right, let's get
the motel owner in here,

14:08.978 --> 14:10.980
find out more about what he saw.Let's go.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.722
♪

14:13.765 --> 14:16.333
Just take a seat.Thanks.

14:16.377 --> 14:18.901
Look, I told the cops
everything I know.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.294
Three times over.

14:20.337 --> 14:22.296
I'm sure I've got
nothing new for you.

14:22.339 --> 14:24.254
You said in your statement
there was a man and a boy

14:24.298 --> 14:25.516
at your motel.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.954
Is this them?Yeah.

14:27.997 --> 14:30.130
They checked in
about a quarter to 3:00.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.783
The man mention anything about
where they were coming from,

14:31.827 --> 14:33.568
or where
they might be headed?

14:33.611 --> 14:37.093
I'm open 24 hours,
I charge 50 bucks a night.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.313
It's not a place where
you ask many questions.

14:39.356 --> 14:40.749
TAN: What about
their interaction?

14:40.792 --> 14:42.794
Anything odd
or distinct you recall?

14:42.838 --> 14:44.231
How so?

14:44.274 --> 14:45.885
Did the little boy have
any marks on him?

14:45.928 --> 14:47.234
Did he seem
scared of the man?

14:47.277 --> 14:48.496
No.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.454
It just seemed like
your basic father-son.

14:50.498 --> 14:52.500
Yeah, except the man
isn't the boy's father.

14:52.543 --> 14:53.805
He kidnapped him.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.506
I never would have guessed.

14:58.549 --> 15:01.204
That boy seemed so
comfortable with that man.

15:01.248 --> 15:03.990
But, uh, he was
terrified as hell

15:04.033 --> 15:05.817
when the two shooters showed up
and went after them.

15:05.861 --> 15:08.081
Hold on. What do you mean
"went after them"?

15:08.124 --> 15:10.866
I thought the sons of bitches
had come to rob me.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.128
Wouldn't have been
the first time.

15:12.172 --> 15:14.391
But no demand for
money. Nothing.

15:14.435 --> 15:17.090
Then they saw the man
and the boy in the hallway,

15:17.133 --> 15:20.223
and it was like
they'd come for them.

15:20.267 --> 15:22.530
Your motel have
security cameras?

15:24.401 --> 15:26.142
HICKS:
This the only camera
this place has?

15:26.186 --> 15:29.102
I think there's
another one.

15:30.146 --> 15:32.540
All right.
There's Liam and Micah.

15:32.583 --> 15:33.628
[screaming]

15:33.671 --> 15:36.413
[gunshots]

15:36.457 --> 15:40.156
The shooters are targeting them.
The motel clerk was right.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.029
This isn't about you, old man!

15:43.072 --> 15:44.769
We just want the kid!

15:44.813 --> 15:45.945
These guys aren't
after the kidnapper.

15:45.988 --> 15:46.989
They're after the boy.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.252
[tires screeching]

15:50.340 --> 15:51.820
Liam's protecting Micah
from these guys.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.474
Then who the hell are they?

15:53.517 --> 15:56.129
And what could they possibly
want with an innocent child?

16:01.438 --> 16:02.962
Can't make out
any patches or insignia,

16:03.005 --> 16:04.398
but judging by the bikes
and their tactics,

16:04.441 --> 16:07.227
my guess is our motel perps
are club affiliated.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.185
Which only muddies
the water more.

16:09.229 --> 16:12.406
Why would a biker club
be chasing a little boy?

16:12.449 --> 16:14.103
Hey, boss, we got
a BOLO out on the car

16:14.147 --> 16:15.931
that Liam and Micah
left the motel in.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.585
Amber Alert's out as well.

16:17.628 --> 16:18.673
All right, copy that.

16:18.716 --> 16:19.979
This is Detective
Ramona Quinn

16:20.022 --> 16:21.458
from the sheriff's
department in Palmdale.

16:21.502 --> 16:23.156
She heard about the shootings
at the Hillwinds Inn.

16:23.199 --> 16:25.158
She thinks she can help us
fill in the blanks.

16:25.201 --> 16:26.724
Nice to meet you.QUINN:
Your shooters belong to

16:26.768 --> 16:29.553
a motorcycle club by the name
of Palmdale Pagans.

16:29.597 --> 16:31.555
They're heavy in the meth trade
and prostitution.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.688
I've been building a case
against them for a while,

16:33.731 --> 16:35.429
but nothing
concrete enough to indict.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.431
You got any idea why they would
go after an eight-year-old kid?

16:37.474 --> 16:39.346
Your guess is as good
as mine on that one,

16:39.389 --> 16:41.957
but maybe the why
doesn't matter right now.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.524
The fact remains,
they want that boy.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.266
All right, what do you suggest
is the better question?

16:46.309 --> 16:49.051
Where? If Liam Dunn
is protecting Micah,

16:49.095 --> 16:50.574
where would he take
the boy?

16:50.618 --> 16:51.706
That's the better question.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.099
HONDO:
All right.

16:53.142 --> 16:54.404
Liam likely wants to
get Micah someplace safe,

16:54.448 --> 16:55.797
somewhere the Pagans
can't find him.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.146
So let's dig into him more.

16:57.190 --> 16:58.756
Family, close friends,
people he can trust.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.150
People in and around L.A.On it.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.853
Abby, we need to know if there's
someone you owe money to.

17:08.896 --> 17:10.159
Someone who would be
very determined

17:10.203 --> 17:11.726
to get it back.Money?

17:11.769 --> 17:14.729
Uh, no.
I-I-I don't think so.

17:14.771 --> 17:16.078
I-I mean,

17:16.122 --> 17:17.471
the only thing
I can think is that I-I--

17:17.513 --> 17:18.950
My boss gave me an advance

17:18.993 --> 17:20.865
on-on my paycheck. I've got to
pay him back for that.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.824
That's not what we mean
and you know it.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.304
We're talking about
drug dealers.

17:24.347 --> 17:26.001
Are you in debt
to drug dealers?

17:26.045 --> 17:29.091
I already told you
that I am not using anymore.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.789
And besides, what does this
have to do with Micah?

17:31.833 --> 17:33.574
I mean,
you guys are in here

17:33.617 --> 17:35.489
asking me about
my money situation

17:35.532 --> 17:36.794
when my baby's out there,

17:36.838 --> 17:38.927
with some ex-con doing
God knows what to him.

17:38.970 --> 17:41.321
I mean, what is wrong
with you people?!

17:41.364 --> 17:42.496
Sit down!

17:42.539 --> 17:44.411
Sit down.

17:44.454 --> 17:45.977
DEACON:
Abby...

17:46.021 --> 17:48.067
Please, sit down.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.026
We want to show you
another video,

When was this taken?We just want the kid!

18:04.170 --> 18:05.606
DEACON:
That was this morning.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.086
Those gunmen are bikers,

18:07.129 --> 18:08.783
most likely
in the drug business.

18:08.826 --> 18:11.307
And the only reason
we can think that

18:11.351 --> 18:13.309
they'd want to take Micah
is that they want

18:13.353 --> 18:15.181
something from you.STREET: Right.

18:15.224 --> 18:19.054
So, I'm going to ask again,
and it would be really helpful

18:19.098 --> 18:21.143
if you were honest.

18:21.187 --> 18:24.146
Do you owe these guys money?

18:24.190 --> 18:27.149
I have never seen
these people in my life.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.933
Well, then what could they
possibly want with Micah?

18:28.977 --> 18:32.067
I don't know, I swear.You know, the more
I think about this,

18:32.111 --> 18:33.764
the more I just can't
shake the feeling

18:33.808 --> 18:36.419
that Micah's disappearance has
to do with your drug problem.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.073
Fine, maybe a year ago,
but not anymore.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.076
I am doing everything I can
to take care of Micah

18:41.120 --> 18:42.904
and to give him
a better life!Oh, come on.

18:42.947 --> 18:44.384
All right.
Let's-let's go back.

18:44.427 --> 18:45.820
The truth is, Abby,
Micah is missing

18:45.863 --> 18:47.561
because of
your bad choices,

18:47.604 --> 18:49.737
and now he just might turn up
dead because of your lies.

18:49.780 --> 18:53.219

Now.

[door slams]

19:05.056 --> 19:08.234
You know, I've seen a lot
of people sit in that chair.

19:08.277 --> 19:10.845
And over the years, I've gotten
pretty good at knowing

19:10.888 --> 19:12.281
when they're lying to me.

19:14.457 --> 19:17.373
I believe you're
telling me the truth.

19:20.289 --> 19:23.771
Now, is there anything that...
that Micah talks to you about?

19:23.814 --> 19:27.035
You know, um, something
that he might be into lately?

19:29.603 --> 19:31.735
The last couple weeks,
he's been...

19:31.779 --> 19:34.608
he's been begging me
for a skateboard.

19:34.651 --> 19:36.262
I mean,
he needs new shoes,

19:36.305 --> 19:38.829
but he just...
[sniffles, chuckles]

19:38.873 --> 19:40.918
He can't stop talking
about a skateboard.

19:40.962 --> 19:43.486
You know,
when he rides the bus,

19:43.530 --> 19:45.706
he sees these skaters
at this old warehouse

19:45.749 --> 19:48.012
next to the shelter.

19:48.883 --> 19:51.059
He loves watching them.

19:55.324 --> 19:57.370
[door closes]

19:59.459 --> 20:00.895
All right.

20:00.938 --> 20:03.985
I'm gonna give you a chance
to talk to me as your friend

20:04.028 --> 20:05.987
and convince me that
your behavior in there was

20:06.030 --> 20:09.208
just a momentary
lack of judgment.Last I checked,

20:09.251 --> 20:11.732
there's only one victim here,
and it's Micah.

20:11.775 --> 20:13.124
Abby may have you fooled,

20:13.168 --> 20:14.996
but she sure as hell
doesn't have me fooled.

20:15.039 --> 20:16.519
But she does
have you fooled.

20:16.563 --> 20:18.304
She's got you thinking
she's your mother.

20:18.347 --> 20:21.002
[exhales]Street, whether
you believe it or not,

20:21.045 --> 20:22.525

20:22.569 --> 20:24.875
everything she can to change
the course of her life.

20:24.919 --> 20:27.356
For herself and her son.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.231
We done here?

20:33.362 --> 20:34.624
Okay.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.583
Now I'm gonna talk to you
as your sergeant.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.847
Micah's case has
brought out a side of you

20:39.890 --> 20:42.066
that is fogging your judgment.
I am removing you from it.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.590
Wh-What?
[scoffs]

20:43.633 --> 20:45.026
You're benching me?

20:45.069 --> 20:47.158
Now we're done here.

[exhales]

20:52.686 --> 20:54.253
What was that about?

20:54.296 --> 20:57.430
I'm benched from Micah's case.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.127
What?

20:59.170 --> 21:01.303
Deacon thinks that
my history with my mom

21:01.347 --> 21:03.218
is messing with my head,
but it's not.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.002
It's actually
what's giving me clarity.

21:05.046 --> 21:07.396
Abby's a drug addict,
drug dealers want her son.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.180
It's not that hard
to connect the dots.

21:09.224 --> 21:11.618
Maybe.Oh, what,
you agree with Deac?

21:11.661 --> 21:14.229
Finding Micah is the priority.You don't think I know that?

21:14.273 --> 21:16.536
Let me finish.
We all want to find that kid.

21:16.579 --> 21:18.886
[exhales]But no one wants that
more than Abby.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.540
Only a parent would go
to the extremes

21:20.583 --> 21:22.890
that she went to
to get him back.

21:22.933 --> 21:25.196
People can change
for the better.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.894
It's easy to forget that
in our line of work,

21:26.937 --> 21:28.243
but they can.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.897
I know that wasn't
true of your mom,

21:29.940 --> 21:32.682
but it is true
of you, Street.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.423
You're living proof of that.

21:40.995 --> 21:43.345
Commander, we did a deep dive
on Liam Dunn's past.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.565
You find anything that'd shed
a little more light

21:45.608 --> 21:46.914
on what we're
dealing with here?Maybe.

21:46.957 --> 21:48.698
Liam had a son.
Seven years ago,

21:48.742 --> 21:50.396
the kid got caught
in the crossfire

21:50.439 --> 21:52.963
of a convenience store
holdup. He was killed.

21:53.007 --> 21:54.530
He was ten years old
at the time.

21:54.574 --> 21:57.228
Seems to be what launched
the spiral of Liam's life.

21:57.272 --> 21:58.926
Lost his job, his marriage,

21:58.969 --> 22:00.710
started getting in trouble
with the law.

22:00.754 --> 22:03.147
That explains why
he was so paternal with Micah.

22:03.191 --> 22:04.758
Also explains why
Liam didn't go to the cops.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.629
The day that his son
was killed,

22:06.673 --> 22:08.979
first officers on the scene
pegged Liam as the shooter.

22:09.023 --> 22:10.459
They took him down,
roughed him up pretty bad.

22:10.503 --> 22:13.332
All while his son was
bleeding out a few feet away.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.116
Whew. Well, that'd
definitely make someone

22:15.159 --> 22:16.596
not trust a badge
after that.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.989
Anything in Liam's backstory

22:19.033 --> 22:22.297
about other family,
someone he might've turned to?

22:22.341 --> 22:23.907
None. Just the wife.

22:23.951 --> 22:26.301
Before their son's death,
they lived in Pasadena.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.868
That's the ex-wife's
last known address.

22:27.911 --> 22:28.956
Has there been any contact
between them?

22:28.999 --> 22:30.218
No evidence of it.

22:30.261 --> 22:31.611
Call logs from
Corcoran indicate

22:31.654 --> 22:33.439
no communication between them
during the five years

22:33.482 --> 22:35.136
he was locked up.HICKS:

to get a unit over to

22:37.007 --> 22:39.140

keep an eye out in case

22:39.183 --> 22:40.576
Liam or Micah shows up.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.318
They got to be getting
pretty desperate by now.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.060
Might be enough to
drive them her way.Yeah.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.629
What are you doing?

22:49.672 --> 22:51.021

the police not like me

And if we go to them,
then I can't help you.

of an execution-style
homicide last night.

25:01.412 --> 25:02.936
But the victim's
a Palmdale local.

managed to pull that off.I wonder what he did
to cross the Pagans

Micah liked

25:32.748 --> 25:36.143
to go watch these skaters at
a nearby abandoned warehouse.

25:36.186 --> 25:38.232
What if he snuck out last night
and that's where he went?

25:38.275 --> 25:39.973
Callahan was killed
just before 2:00,

25:40.016 --> 25:41.322
and it was only
a little while later

25:41.365 --> 25:43.150
that Micah and Liam
took off from the shelter.

25:43.193 --> 25:44.934
Micah was there
last night.

25:44.978 --> 25:47.023
He must've witnessed
Callahan's murder.

25:47.067 --> 25:48.938
That explains why
the Pagans want him dead.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.331
Guarantees
he won't talk.

25:50.374 --> 25:52.551
Right. So now we know
why the Pagans want him.
