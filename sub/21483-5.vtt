WEBVTT

00:02.855 --> 00:04.855
I cannot set
a good lineup.

00:04.857 --> 00:06.857
My bench keeps
out-performing my starters.

00:06.859 --> 00:09.776
My bench is this magical mystery
realm, where ordinary players

00:09.778 --> 00:11.368
play like superstars.

00:11.370 --> 00:14.439
Like if Kevin were on my bench,
he'd be a six-five billionaire

00:14.441 --> 00:15.809
who could sexually
please his wife.

00:15.811 --> 00:16.376
Hey!

00:16.378 --> 00:17.375
I'm thrilled.

00:17.377 --> 00:19.375
I'm playing you this week, and
I am going to clobber you.

00:19.377 --> 00:21.375
Yeah, I believe you will.

00:21.377 --> 00:25.381
I have no feel for my team,
and it's stressing me out.

00:25.383 --> 00:26.385
Oh, God.

00:26.387 --> 00:27.390
Andre, really?

00:27.392 --> 00:28.862
What are the
things proposed?

00:28.864 --> 00:32.365
What the...
Good pizza, good friends, good time.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.369
Yeah.

00:33.371 --> 00:34.907
Plus, I already got
five comments.

00:34.909 --> 00:36.843
Someone goes, "That's
a spicy pizza."

00:36.845 --> 00:38.615
Seriously, could
you please stop it?

00:38.617 --> 00:40.618
All of you, you guys
are so annoying.

00:40.620 --> 00:43.492
All these online social
interactions, 24 hours a day,

00:43.494 --> 00:45.997
seven days a week, and, Jenny,
can you please stop posting

00:45.999 --> 00:48.634
pictures of your stupid
kid all the time?

00:48.636 --> 00:50.236
That stupid kid is your niece.

00:50.238 --> 00:52.239
Yeah.
I don't care if it's my dick.

00:52.241 --> 00:54.943
I don't need to see a thousand pictures
of it pretending to ride a dog.

00:54.945 --> 00:57.012
You know what, I'm tweeting
everything you're saying, and

00:57.014 --> 00:57.946
people are really behind you.

00:57.948 --> 00:59.549
I'm going to tweet
your face, Andre.

00:59.551 --> 01:00.551
Oh!

01:00.553 --> 01:03.122
Guys, Taco's got a point, okay?

01:03.124 --> 01:05.191
I mean, the whole, like,
Tweeter, Facebook thing, it's

01:05.193 --> 01:06.093
getting a little out of hand.

01:06.095 --> 01:07.663
Well, I've come up
with an alternative.

01:07.665 --> 01:11.433
I've created the first-ever
offline social network.

01:11.435 --> 01:13.904
I think this has been
happening for a while, Taco.

01:13.906 --> 01:14.905
It's called "society."

01:14.907 --> 01:16.474
It's better than society.

01:16.476 --> 01:17.909
It's "MyFace."

01:17.911 --> 01:18.910
MyFace?

01:18.912 --> 01:22.114
I'll give you an example.

01:22.116 --> 01:23.115
That's my profile pic.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.118
Watch. I'll post a comment.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.121
"I didn't bring any money
to pay for my meal today."

01:27.123 --> 01:28.123
For real?

01:28.125 --> 01:29.123
Yeah.

01:29.125 --> 01:30.124
Can I borrow ten bucks?

01:30.126 --> 01:34.928
Oh... You are going
to thank me for this.

01:34.930 --> 01:35.929
I need to relax.

01:35.931 --> 01:37.464
I need to figure something out.

01:37.466 --> 01:40.467
I had no mojo.

01:40.469 --> 01:43.936
This place will fix your mind,
your heart and your body.

01:43.938 --> 01:48.509
I don't know what's healing about
stewing in a bunch of communist B.O.

01:48.511 --> 01:49.945
Wear your grippies.

01:49.947 --> 01:50.946
What?

01:50.948 --> 01:52.147
Your grippies, you know.

01:52.149 --> 01:53.149
Gorilla-Grips.

01:53.151 --> 01:55.151
They have tensile strength
of an actual gorilla.

01:55.153 --> 01:58.923
Look, I'm not planning on giving four
people hand and foot jobs today.

02:00.927 --> 02:05.331
Okay, guys, welcome to
Harmony Yoga Studio.

02:05.333 --> 02:06.331
New student.

02:06.333 --> 02:07.332
Oh, new student!

02:07.334 --> 02:08.333
Great.

02:08.335 --> 02:14.739
If anyone here is pregnant or menstruating,
uh, please avoid inversions.

02:14.741 --> 02:16.942
Okay, he's both pregnant
and and menstruating.

02:16.944 --> 02:18.343
I'm not on my moon cycle.

02:18.345 --> 02:19.344
There's no judgments here.

02:19.346 --> 02:20.345
Thank you.

02:20.347 --> 02:22.547
All right, we're going to
start in seated position.

02:22.549 --> 02:24.549
Come on, sit Indian style.

02:24.551 --> 02:26.617
Indian style's for kids at
summer camp who got diddled by

02:26.619 --> 02:29.121
their Croatian windsurfing
instructor named Goran.

02:29.123 --> 02:30.122
That's disgusting.

02:30.124 --> 02:33.059
All right, we're gonna
start three sets of om.

02:33.061 --> 02:36.697
Inhale through your nose...

02:36.699 --> 02:43.138
and om...

02:43.140 --> 02:48.378
Om...

02:48.498 --> 02:58.338
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrected by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:58.458 --> 03:01.394
And let's do this last
one with a smile.

03:01.396 --> 03:11.105
Om... Vincent Jackson...

03:12.528 --> 03:14.909
Oh, Rob Gronkowski!

03:14.911 --> 03:15.910
How did you know to play him?

03:15.912 --> 03:17.679
Optimum lineup choosing.

03:17.681 --> 03:18.926
It's all due to yoga.

03:19.046 --> 03:23.515
And I look forward to using your
bullshit, unicorn, rainbow

03:23.517 --> 03:25.484
calisthenics to crush you.

03:25.486 --> 03:27.386
Okay, next week, I will
have lineup Nirvana.

03:27.388 --> 03:27.986
Watch, all right?

03:27.988 --> 03:28.487
Absolutely not.

03:28.489 --> 03:32.291
Can you do me a favor and stop sending
me these text messages, please?

03:32.293 --> 03:33.292
It's weirding me out.

03:33.294 --> 03:33.859
Oh!

03:33.861 --> 03:34.860
It's not me; it's him.

03:34.862 --> 03:36.795
Looks like ye
bobbum man is back.

03:36.797 --> 03:37.496
What?!

03:37.498 --> 03:38.997
What are you guys talking
about right now?

03:38.999 --> 03:41.867
It's... okay... There's this thing we
did in college; it's basically like

03:41.869 --> 03:42.801
phone chicken.

03:42.803 --> 03:44.870
We would try to horrify each other
into hanging up first, and

03:44.872 --> 03:46.605
we all develop our own
little characters.

03:46.607 --> 03:49.608
And his happened to be extremely
creepy and weird and

03:49.610 --> 03:51.177
made me very uncomfortable.

03:51.179 --> 03:52.011
Bobbum man.

03:52.013 --> 03:53.012
Ye bobbum man.

03:53.014 --> 03:56.282
Ye bobbum man:
He creepied up in the bobbum van,

03:56.284 --> 04:00.721
filled with equipmonk for great
grief to making at you underneath.

04:01.557 --> 04:03.490
Kevin, you had one
of the weirdest.

04:03.492 --> 04:04.492
What was it?

04:04.494 --> 04:06.995
It was mundane ejaculation
man; it was stupid.

04:06.997 --> 04:07.996
I want to hear it.

04:07.998 --> 04:08.997
Dude, show him.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.666
Okay. Andre, what did you
have for lunch today?

04:11.668 --> 04:12.667
I had a cheeseburger.

04:12.669 --> 04:13.802
Oh, God, I'm gonna come.

04:13.804 --> 04:15.804
I'm so close to coming, Andre!

04:15.806 --> 04:18.841
And he would just go on
with it until you hung up.

04:18.843 --> 04:21.278
Well, no one went on as
long as the crawdad man.

04:21.279 --> 04:22.279
True.

04:22.281 --> 04:23.080
Is that your guy?

04:23.082 --> 04:24.081
Oh, the crawdad man!

04:24.083 --> 04:26.082
Every day is a hard day
down by the river.

04:26.084 --> 04:28.651
I got to go get my buckets and fill
them buckets up with them crawdads.

04:28.653 --> 04:29.652
I got to keep them separated.

04:29.654 --> 04:32.289
If you don't keep them separated,
they're gonna eat themselves.

04:32.291 --> 04:33.290
They're gonna eat themselves!

04:33.292 --> 04:34.291
What is a crawdad?

04:34.293 --> 04:35.759
It's like an evil trip.

04:35.761 --> 04:37.060
Yours was good, too.

04:37.062 --> 04:38.562
I mean, Korean Dick Vitale.

04:38.564 --> 04:39.663
You kidding me?

04:39.665 --> 04:42.232
Oh, that's a diaper dandy!

04:42.234 --> 04:44.701
Awesome, baby!

04:45.703 --> 04:48.304
Honestly, bobbum man
was the creepiest.

04:48.306 --> 04:52.975
He was like this sad, middle-
aged, virile man driving around

04:52.977 --> 04:54.109
in a van with his equipmonk.

04:54.111 --> 04:55.677
Equipmonk?

04:55.679 --> 04:56.678
That was-- ugh!

04:56.680 --> 05:01.582
And the equipmonk was specifically
designed to just tear Kevin apart, and

05:01.584 --> 05:04.585
specifically it's bobbum man...
Look, bobbum was a long

05:04.587 --> 05:07.254
time ago, so let's just drop
the bobbum thing, okay?

05:07.256 --> 05:11.592
Maybe the bobbum girl going to
come and rock your bobbum world.

05:11.594 --> 05:13.861
Crawdaddy man, could you
please help me out?

05:13.863 --> 05:15.629
Oh, did someone call
for crawdaddy man?

05:15.631 --> 05:16.263
What do you need?

05:16.265 --> 05:17.731
Why are you masturbating
as crawdad man?

05:17.733 --> 05:19.767
Well, I was in the middle of
picking up my cr-- I'm in

05:19.769 --> 05:21.702
waders, and I'm picking
my crawdads up.

05:21.704 --> 05:22.703
All right, Andre, you win.

05:22.705 --> 05:23.704
You are the creepiest.

05:23.706 --> 05:25.706
Oh, thank you very much, ma'am.

05:27.399 --> 05:28.955
Big, big day coming up.

05:29.075 --> 05:32.083
Ellie's gymnastics...
No.

05:32.203 --> 05:33.289
What?

05:33.409 --> 05:34.637
Wow.

05:35.656 --> 05:37.222
Really? Our sex-iversary?

05:37.224 --> 05:38.223
Right.

05:38.225 --> 05:39.342
- Doesn't it ring a bell?
- It's certainly coming up.

05:39.457 --> 05:41.457
We should definitely
celebrate that this year.

05:41.459 --> 05:42.205
We haven't celebrated
that in years.

05:42.325 --> 05:43.904
- Yeah.
- When do you want to do it?

05:44.896 --> 05:45.894
Wow!

05:45.896 --> 05:49.798
You don't remember the date of the
first time we had sex, do you?

05:49.800 --> 05:54.470
I don't... remember... the actual date,
but I totally remember having sex...

05:54.472 --> 05:55.904
What do you remember?

05:55.906 --> 05:56.905
Tell me about
what you remember.

05:56.907 --> 05:59.808
We went to Zanies, and
we saw Paula Poundstone.

05:59.810 --> 06:00.808
We got totally wasted.

06:00.810 --> 06:01.809
Yeah.

06:01.811 --> 06:03.810
And you took me home in your
Tracer and you rocked my world.

06:03.812 --> 06:04.811
I did rock your world.

06:04.813 --> 06:05.812
It was so good.

06:05.814 --> 06:10.817
Yes, and it <i>was</i> good, but not
good enough to remember the actual date.

06:10.819 --> 06:11.818
Just tell me when it is.

06:11.820 --> 06:12.820
No. No, no, no, no.

06:12.822 --> 06:13.821
We'll celebrate.

06:13.823 --> 06:14.188
No.

06:14.190 --> 06:14.855
Is it tonight?

06:14.857 --> 06:16.190
No, it is not tonight.

06:16.192 --> 06:19.626
And trust me, even if it were tonight,
we would not be celebrating.

06:19.628 --> 06:21.629
Really?

06:23.000 --> 06:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:35.209 --> 06:36.443
Kevin.

06:37.446 --> 06:39.445
Taco, it's the
middle of the night.

06:39.447 --> 06:40.446
You've got mail.

06:40.448 --> 06:42.448
You've received a
message from Taco.

06:42.450 --> 06:43.449
No, I don't.

06:43.451 --> 06:45.451
Oh, come on.

06:45.453 --> 06:50.457
"You have been invited to join
"MyFace, an offline social network.

06:50.459 --> 06:51.959
If you accept, tell Taco!!!"

06:51.961 --> 06:56.998
Taco, I don't want you breaking into my
house at 4:00 in the morning anymore.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.400
Yeah, that's what all
the other guys said.

06:58.402 --> 07:00.469
You guys should form a MyFace
group-- "People who don't like

07:00.471 --> 07:02.404
getting their houses
broken into at 4:00 a.m."

07:02.406 --> 07:04.239
Fine, I accept, Taco.

07:04.241 --> 07:05.073
Please, go.

07:05.075 --> 07:05.707
Great.

07:05.709 --> 07:06.708
Welcome to MyFace.

07:06.710 --> 07:08.643
It is now time to
choose a profile face.

07:08.645 --> 07:12.380
Are you content with the face
you are currently displaying?

07:12.382 --> 07:14.415
You sure you want
to pick that face?

07:14.417 --> 07:15.917
Try another one.

07:15.919 --> 07:17.885
Better.

07:17.887 --> 07:18.419
Great.

07:18.421 --> 07:19.420
That's perfect.

07:19.422 --> 07:20.321
Do you accept?

07:20.323 --> 07:21.655
Taco, please leave my home.

07:21.657 --> 07:23.257
I will take that as a yes.

07:23.259 --> 07:26.827
Hey, you have a message.

07:26.829 --> 07:28.829
Equipmonk sharp.

07:28.831 --> 07:30.331
Equipmonk dirty.

07:30.333 --> 07:32.433
Equipmonk make Kevin
bobbum hurty.

07:32.435 --> 07:35.170
Bobbum...

07:37.807 --> 07:43.179
I will now join the MyFace group "People
who eat food out of Kevin's fridge."

07:43.181 --> 07:44.881
She forgot your sexiversary?

07:44.883 --> 07:45.448
Yep.

07:45.450 --> 07:47.450
She doesn't remember the first
time you put your little

07:47.452 --> 07:49.051
fingerling potato inside of her?

07:49.053 --> 07:49.786
Wow.

07:49.788 --> 07:54.858
No idea when your tired little boy
slumped in to her beanbag chair?

07:54.860 --> 07:57.460
Can we just talk about how
sad this is that you're

07:57.462 --> 07:59.596
celebrating your sex-versary?

07:59.598 --> 08:03.633
Do you also celebrate the first time that
she went down on you for oralversary?

08:03.635 --> 08:06.403
Or maybe the first time you
guys did anal for analversary.

08:06.405 --> 08:07.137
My God.

08:07.139 --> 08:09.506
Well, to celebrate the
anniversary, I think the actual

08:09.508 --> 08:11.208
event must have occurred first.

08:11.210 --> 08:12.409
Hello, gentlemen.

08:12.411 --> 08:14.778
So nice to meet you
offline like this.

08:14.780 --> 08:15.412
Out of the way.

08:15.414 --> 08:16.747
Oh.

08:16.749 --> 08:22.419
And say hello to the newest additionth
to the World Wide World, my MyFace wall.

08:22.421 --> 08:23.954
Wait, what the hell is this?

08:23.956 --> 08:24.955
Yeah, huh?

08:24.957 --> 08:25.990
You post pictures.

08:25.992 --> 08:27.424
Here are my status updates.

08:27.426 --> 08:30.795

08:30.797 --> 08:32.261
Wow, Sofia's on MyFace?

08:32.264 --> 08:33.730
Oh, yeah, she loves MyFace.

08:33.732 --> 08:34.798
She's all over it.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.067
What's this chain thing here?

08:36.068 --> 08:37.000
That is a link.

08:37.001 --> 08:41.438
That's a pic of Kevin, and the link
brings you to Jenny and their mistake.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.240
Oh... my God.

08:43.241 --> 08:47.010
Oh, bobbum man is on MyFace.

08:47.012 --> 08:47.744
What?

08:47.746 --> 08:51.981
"When up in there is all destroy,
this is ye butt, bobbum boy."

08:51.983 --> 08:52.682
It's not funny.

08:52.684 --> 08:54.650
Oh, how'd you get that picture
of me in <i>Godspell?</i>

08:54.652 --> 08:56.152
<i>That was on my vanity.</i>

08:56.154 --> 08:57.586
<i>That's my personal property.</i>

08:57.588 --> 08:58.621
<i>Okay, hold on.</i>

08:58.623 --> 08:59.822
<i>Couple of questions real quick.</i>

08:59.824 --> 09:01.924
<i>First of all, why was
that on your vanity?</i>

09:01.926 --> 09:03.625
<i>Secondly, why do you
have a vanity at all?</i>

09:03.627 --> 09:06.228
<i>And thirdly, if you must have a
vanity, why do you have to call</i>

09:06.230 --> 09:06.795
<i>it a vanity?</i>

09:06.797 --> 09:08.931
<i>Why do you have pictures of
Rafi on the MyFace wall?</i>

09:08.933 --> 09:10.400
<i>Because he's my MyFace friend.</i>

09:10.402 --> 09:11.334
<i>Excuse me!</i>

09:11.336 --> 09:12.202
<i>Hey!</i>

09:12.204 --> 09:13.370
<i>Speak of the lunatic.</i>

09:13.372 --> 09:14.638
<i>Rafi is here!</i>

09:14.640 --> 09:16.106
<i>See, status update.</i>

09:16.108 --> 09:17.641
<i>Boom, MyFace friend.</i>

09:17.643 --> 09:18.642
<i>I'm gonna poke you.</i>

09:18.644 --> 09:19.677
<i>Ah, I'm gonna stab you.</i>

09:19.679 --> 09:20.645
<i>Offline.</i>

09:20.647 --> 09:21.412
<i>With a real knife.</i>

09:21.414 --> 09:22.180
<i>Please don't.</i>

09:22.182 --> 09:22.947
<i>What?</i>

09:22.949 --> 09:24.949
<i>Taco, I need your help.</i>

09:24.951 --> 09:26.784
<i>You need me to raise Ellie.</i>

09:26.786 --> 09:28.386
<i>Okay, she can stay here.</i>

09:28.388 --> 09:30.387
<i>I of course will be
staying at your place.</i>

09:30.389 --> 09:32.022
<i>I don't need you to raise Ellie.</i>

09:32.024 --> 09:33.023
<i>Ellie is fine.</i>

09:33.025 --> 09:34.391
<i>Mm.</i>

09:34.393 --> 09:36.126
<i>I forgot our sex-iversary!</i>

09:36.128 --> 09:38.996
<i>I forgot Kevin's and
my sex-iversary.</i>

09:38.998 --> 09:39.730
<i>Wow.</i>

09:39.732 --> 09:40.731
<i>Well, that's normal.</i>

09:40.733 --> 09:43.401
<i>When you have sex as much as we do,
you can't be expected to pin</i>

09:43.403 --> 09:44.369
<i>down any one occasion.</i>

09:44.371 --> 09:49.441
<i>I have this vague recollection
that you busted us that night.</i>

09:49.443 --> 09:50.142
<i>Yes.</i>

09:50.144 --> 09:51.877
<i>And that you might
have taken picture.</i>

09:51.879 --> 09:52.812
<i>Did you take a picture?</i>

09:52.814 --> 09:55.448
<i>I just posted a bunch of old
pictures of Kevin on my Face wall.</i>

09:55.450 --> 09:56.182
<i>Great!</i>

09:56.184 --> 09:57.150
<i>Was it one of the pictures?</i>

09:57.152 --> 09:58.251
<i>I don't know.</i>

09:58.253 --> 10:01.455
<i>Uh, if you're gonna view my wall,
you're gonna have to sign into MyFace.</i>

10:01.457 --> 10:02.389
<i>Okay.</i>

10:02.391 --> 10:03.390
<i>Password?</i>

10:03.392 --> 10:05.092
<i>I don't have a password, Taco!</i>

10:05.094 --> 10:07.161
<i>We're gonna have to
retrieve your password.</i>

10:07.163 --> 10:08.896
<i>Security question number one:</i>

10:08.898 --> 10:10.731
<i>What color panties are
you wearing right now?</i>

10:10.733 --> 10:11.432
<i>What?</i>

10:11.434 --> 10:12.899
<i>No-No.</i>

10:12.901 --> 10:13.700
<i>Okay.</i>

10:13.702 --> 10:14.901
<i>Dildos or vibrators?</i>

10:14.903 --> 10:17.036
<i>I-I'm not answering
that question.</i>

10:17.038 --> 10:18.471
<i>Top ten lesbian experiences.</i>

10:18.473 --> 10:20.239
<i>I'm not going there
with you, Taco!</i>

10:20.241 --> 10:20.906
<i>Stop!</i>

10:20.908 --> 10:21.473
<i>Fine.</i>

10:21.475 --> 10:23.909
<i>I'm gonna need you to retype
the letters in this box.</i>

10:23.911 --> 10:26.545
<i>There are no letters in that box;
it's a spider with penises</i>

10:26.547 --> 10:27.112
<i>for legs.</i>

10:27.114 --> 10:28.748
<i>Now I believe it's you.</i>

10:28.750 --> 10:30.016
<i>Welcome to MyFace.</i>

10:30.018 --> 10:31.451
<i>You may now view my wall.</i>

10:31.453 --> 10:32.485
<i>Thank you.</i>

10:32.487 --> 10:33.186
<i>Wow.</i>

10:33.188 --> 10:34.020
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:34.022 --> 10:35.188
<i>Been really busy.</i>

10:35.190 --> 10:37.791
<i>Oh, my God, look
at Ruxin's fro.</i>

10:38.494 --> 10:39.260
<i>Oh!</i>

10:39.262 --> 10:43.097
<i>I would recognize
that bra anywhere.</i>

10:43.099 --> 10:44.204
<i>Look at that-- oh,
and there we go.</i>

10:44.324 --> 10:46.196
<i>November 2, 2001.</i>

10:46.316 --> 10:48.317
<i>Thank you so much
for this, Taco.</i>

10:48.481 --> 10:51.548
<i>Don't thank me, thank MyFace.</i>

10:51.550 --> 10:52.616
<i>Thank you, face.</i>

10:52.618 --> 10:54.985
<i>You have a message from Taco.</i>

10:54.987 --> 10:56.186
<i>Happy sex-iversary.</i>

10:56.188 --> 10:57.521
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

10:57.523 --> 10:59.890
<i>Let him put it wherever.</i>

11:01.511 --> 11:06.918
Okay, great, let's get on all fours
for our final position-- cat and cow.

11:06.929 --> 11:09.852
If we can inhale and
arch our backs up.

11:09.854 --> 11:13.839
And exhale, curve the spine.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.842
I'm getting no lineup
nirvana right now.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.911
I'm trying to get lineup
nirvana by staring at this

11:18.913 --> 11:20.413
girl's sex boobs, but I'm
not getting a thing.

11:20.415 --> 11:23.849
All right, guys, let's
move to a seated position.

11:23.851 --> 11:28.387
're gonna end our class
with three ohms.

11:28.389 --> 11:31.090
No personal mantras.

11:31.092 --> 11:32.425
Just "ohm."

11:32.427 --> 11:36.863
♪ Ohm... ♪

11:36.865 --> 11:40.232
Okay, I really don't appreciate
your sarcastic "ohm."

11:40.234 --> 11:41.901
That wasn't a sarcastic "ohm."

11:41.903 --> 11:46.940
Yes, it was a sarcastic "ohm," and it's disres...
Mmm... No it wasn't.

11:46.942 --> 11:49.042
Okay, I think both of you
need to leave right now.

11:49.044 --> 11:49.776
What?

11:49.778 --> 11:53.781
He should be able to stay,
because Andre loves yoga.

11:53.783 --> 11:57.118
Okay, I can't take your
stupid sarcasm right now.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.252
But you're being disrespectful.

11:58.254 --> 12:00.889
I want you to take your mat,
your stupid driving gloves and

12:00.891 --> 12:03.158
your idiot friend and get
the hell out of my class!

12:03.160 --> 12:04.826
They're not driving
gloves, they're Grippies.

12:04.828 --> 12:06.895
They have the tensile
strength of a gorilla.

12:07.798 --> 12:08.397
Sidney Rice.

12:08.399 --> 12:10.399
We could've done great
things together.

12:10.401 --> 12:14.269
If you had someone throwing you the
ball consistently every week...

12:17.808 --> 12:20.008
Hello?

12:20.010 --> 12:21.810
Yeah-- hello?

12:21.812 --> 12:23.811
What is this?

12:28.083 --> 12:29.083
Taco?

12:29.085 --> 12:31.419
Hello?

12:34.923 --> 12:39.327
"Fe, fi, fo, fum, the end
are near at thou bobbum.

12:39.329 --> 12:44.766
Tie me open bobbum van trunk for
ruin bobbum with equipmonk."

12:47.203 --> 12:49.137
Who's ruining my equipmonk?

12:49.139 --> 12:53.175
Nobody's gonna ruin my
bobbum with equipmonk.

12:53.177 --> 12:54.376
Stupid Taco.

12:59.383 --> 13:00.182
Hey.

13:00.184 --> 13:02.050
Hey.

13:02.052 --> 13:02.718
Wow.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.186
Guess who figured it out.

13:04.188 --> 13:05.387
I think you did.

13:05.389 --> 13:07.289
Happy sex-iversary.

13:10.394 --> 13:13.294
I love your face.

13:13.296 --> 13:15.830
And your chest.

13:15.832 --> 13:19.166
And I want to put it in your bobbum.
Uh, whoa.

13:19.168 --> 13:19.800
What?

13:19.802 --> 13:20.401
Huh?

13:20.403 --> 13:21.235
What did you just say?

13:21.237 --> 13:22.002
Nothing.

13:22.004 --> 13:23.303
You said "bobbum."

13:23.305 --> 13:25.373
Babe, I was talking
about your equipmonk.

13:25.375 --> 13:27.908
My equipmonk?

13:27.910 --> 13:29.210
Uh, I'm sorry.

13:29.212 --> 13:30.211
It's going through my brain.

13:30.213 --> 13:32.180
You don't understand, it was...
Not tonight it's not.

13:32.182 --> 13:34.149
Sex-iversary... Bobbum free.

13:34.151 --> 13:35.850
Let's throttle back up.

13:35.852 --> 13:36.718
Where were we?

13:36.720 --> 13:37.886
I don't know.

13:37.888 --> 13:41.056
I don't know if you can
handle couch sex. Huh?

13:41.058 --> 13:44.160
Oh, I can handle it.

13:45.263 --> 13:45.928
Bobbum!

13:45.930 --> 13:46.428
Right there!

13:46.430 --> 13:47.730
Are you kidding me right now?

13:47.732 --> 13:50.065
Yes! He had sunglasses and...
He's not real!

13:50.067 --> 13:51.099
No, he's real, Jenny!

13:51.101 --> 13:52.267
He put a note on the door.

13:52.269 --> 13:53.268
A note?

13:53.270 --> 13:56.704
Yes, it said, "Fee-fi-fo-fum, I'm
gonna mess with your equipmonk."

13:56.706 --> 13:59.373
He is a figment of your imagination
that your friends made up.

13:59.375 --> 14:02.576
No, he's real, and he's scary,
and he's going to hurt.

14:02.578 --> 14:03.377
You know what?

14:03.379 --> 14:05.779
Have a great sex-iversary
with the bobbum man.

14:05.781 --> 14:06.914
I'm out.

14:06.916 --> 14:07.949
What?

14:07.951 --> 14:09.384
No!

14:09.386 --> 14:13.188
Aw, now I got to play
with my own equipmonk.

14:13.190 --> 14:16.258
You wrecked the
entire thing for me.

14:16.260 --> 14:18.394
I am now banned from
yoga because of you.

14:18.396 --> 14:20.763
I tried to call up and
apologize to her, right?

14:20.765 --> 14:23.232
She told me, "Oh, go do an
inversion on your moon cycle."

14:23.234 --> 14:24.100
What's that?

14:24.102 --> 14:26.736
It's when a woman stands on
her head during her period.

14:26.738 --> 14:27.403
Oh, right.

14:27.405 --> 14:28.404
Now what am I going to do?

14:28.406 --> 14:30.406
How am I going to reach
light-up nirvana?

14:30.408 --> 14:32.108
Ban or no ban, I'm
going back in.

14:32.110 --> 14:33.042
Look, it's not my fault.

14:33.044 --> 14:34.977
I tried to tell her how
much you loved yoga.

14:34.979 --> 14:37.213
That's exactly it-- you
were being sarcastic.

14:37.215 --> 14:38.381
I'm not being sarcastic.

14:38.383 --> 14:39.315
I'm sorry.

14:39.317 --> 14:40.983
That, Ruxin, is sarcasm.

14:40.985 --> 14:42.284
I don't think that's sarcasm.

14:42.286 --> 14:43.285
It was.

14:43.287 --> 14:44.386
Asshole!

14:44.388 --> 14:45.821
Yeah, you.

14:45.823 --> 14:47.990
Don't give me the babe
in the woods routine.

14:47.992 --> 14:50.126
You ruined my
sex-iversary with Jenny.

14:50.128 --> 14:52.695
You were standing outside
dressed as bobbum man lurking

14:52.697 --> 14:55.364
through my window with
your lurkily eyes.

14:55.366 --> 14:56.566
I was not there.

14:56.568 --> 14:57.633
Kevin, that was not me.

14:57.635 --> 15:00.269
You had sunglasses on, the
hood, creepily staring in.

15:00.271 --> 15:02.171
No, he was with me last night.

15:02.173 --> 15:03.073
We saw the Kesha concert.

15:03.075 --> 15:04.174
It was awesome.

15:04.176 --> 15:05.375
She played "Tik Tok" twice.

15:05.377 --> 15:07.844
He's kidding-- I did not
go to the Kesha concert.

15:07.846 --> 15:09.113
I was being bobbum man.

15:09.115 --> 15:10.080
I was outside your window.

15:10.082 --> 15:12.149
No, no, no, no, it wasn't you.

15:12.151 --> 15:13.250
You were at the Kesha concert.

15:13.252 --> 15:16.254
Andre posted the VIP
bracelets on my MyFace wall.

15:16.256 --> 15:19.691
Look, I... I think I'm responsible
for the whole bobbum man thing.

15:19.693 --> 15:20.391
So you did it?

15:20.393 --> 15:21.359
You're the asshole?

15:21.361 --> 15:24.396
No, I created an off-line avatar
for the character of bobbum man.

15:24.398 --> 15:25.330
An off-line avatar?

15:25.332 --> 15:27.132
That would be a
real person, then.

15:27.134 --> 15:30.670
Yeah, yeah, so I asked Raffi to play the
character, and he really got into it.

15:30.672 --> 15:31.670
Raffi?

15:31.672 --> 15:33.939
Yeah, so it was probably him
standing outside your window

15:33.941 --> 15:35.975
while you were having
boring sex with Jenny.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.877
Let me give you a
little bit of advice.

15:37.879 --> 15:40.781
When casting a sexual psychopath
with a van, you don't actually

15:40.783 --> 15:43.317
have to cast a sexual
psychopath with a van.

15:43.319 --> 15:44.418
But it's so much easier.

15:44.420 --> 15:45.419
He already knows how to do it.

15:45.421 --> 15:48.421
This may be partially
my fault, too.

15:48.423 --> 15:49.856
Ooh, ooh!

15:49.858 --> 15:51.057
Raffi bomb.

15:51.059 --> 15:53.359
Raffi, what are you doing here?

15:53.361 --> 15:56.695
So Taco wants me to play the off-line
avatar of this sex offender guy.

15:56.697 --> 15:58.364
Sounds like typecasting, Raffi.

15:58.366 --> 15:59.364
What's that mean?

15:59.366 --> 16:00.365
Pigeonholing.

16:00.367 --> 16:03.868
No, I told him specifically, I'm
not doing any pigeonholing, okay?

16:03.870 --> 16:04.969
I'm not going to find a coup.

16:04.971 --> 16:06.137
I'm not going to
scoop the coup.

16:06.139 --> 16:08.139
I'm not going to
blast any pigeons.

16:08.141 --> 16:08.973
I don't do that anymore.

16:08.975 --> 16:11.709
I think we have very different
definitions of what pigeonholing is.

16:11.711 --> 16:12.376
I doubt it.

16:12.378 --> 16:14.378
What are you doing here, Raffi?

16:14.380 --> 16:16.214
I want to know if this
is a good idea or not.

16:16.216 --> 16:17.883
Yeah, I think it's a great idea.

16:17.885 --> 16:20.018
All right, good, then
I'll do it-- thank you.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.821
I think you and Taco working
together, nothing could go wrong.

16:22.823 --> 16:24.723
Well, actually, I think a lot
could go wrong, but if you think

16:24.725 --> 16:26.826
it's a good idea, then
I'm going to do it.

16:26.828 --> 16:27.760
Two thumbs up, Raffi.

16:27.762 --> 16:28.694
All right, awesome.

16:28.696 --> 16:29.395
High five.

16:29.397 --> 16:30.396
You should wash that hand.

16:30.398 --> 16:31.330
I'm taking this eagle.

16:31.332 --> 16:32.331
Later.

16:32.333 --> 16:35.034
I didn't know Raffi was taking about
bobbum man, and regardless, he took it the

16:35.036 --> 16:35.902
wrong way.

16:35.904 --> 16:36.736
Oh, you know why?

16:36.738 --> 16:39.406
Because no one ever knows what you're
saying-- whether it's real or sarcastic.

16:39.408 --> 16:41.275
You don't know your
sarcastic strength.

16:41.277 --> 16:43.911
Look, it's not my fault that
if someone doesn't understand

16:43.913 --> 16:46.413
irony that someone else ends up
getting non-ironically buggered.

16:46.415 --> 16:48.416
Well, it's not going
to happen to me, okay?

16:48.418 --> 16:50.684
We're all going to get in the
car now, and we're going to go

16:50.686 --> 16:52.919
to Raffi's place and explain
to him that it was a joke.

16:52.921 --> 16:54.354
Wait, Raffi has a place?

16:54.356 --> 16:56.356
Yeah, he calls it
the Equipmonk Shed.

16:56.358 --> 16:57.357
Don't say equipmonk.

16:57.359 --> 16:58.926
It gives me gweat gwief.

16:58.928 --> 17:00.360
In your underneath?

17:00.362 --> 17:02.062
Easy, "Tik Tok."

17:02.064 --> 17:03.364
This is Raffi's place?

17:03.366 --> 17:05.800
Where'd all these
chairs come from?

17:05.801 --> 17:07.367
First time I see that.

17:07.369 --> 17:09.637
He's not going to get
his deposit back.

17:09.638 --> 17:12.140
This is where he wanted to
throw Baby Jeffrey's birthday.

17:12.142 --> 17:13.941
Okay, what is that?

17:13.943 --> 17:15.810
That's his toilet/kitchen.

17:15.811 --> 17:17.211
Both?

17:17.213 --> 17:18.813
Wow, that's efficient.

17:18.815 --> 17:20.381
So where is Raffi now?

17:20.383 --> 17:21.715
I don't know.

17:21.718 --> 17:25.319
He left that shit-stained
mattress and that thing there.

17:25.320 --> 17:27.287
Oh, he left his MyFace wall.

17:27.289 --> 17:29.990
That is a lot of bobbums.

17:29.992 --> 17:32.226
There's a lot of
knives on here, too.

17:32.228 --> 17:33.093
Oh, great.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.294
This is unbelievable.

17:34.296 --> 17:36.397
How come my bobbum's
not on there?

17:36.399 --> 17:39.399
What about these jeans with the angel
wings and the knife going through it?

17:39.401 --> 17:40.400
Yeah, I think it is.

17:40.402 --> 17:41.401
Okay, phew.

17:41.403 --> 17:43.103
This is out of control, Ruxin.

17:43.105 --> 17:46.673
We have to get Raffi to cease and desist
with this bobbum man MyFace crap.

17:46.675 --> 17:47.974
I paged him.

17:47.976 --> 17:49.143
I have not heard anything back.

17:49.145 --> 17:50.244
Don't worry about it, guys.

17:50.246 --> 17:52.346
I know how to get
in touch with him.

17:52.348 --> 17:53.848
Ta-da.

17:53.850 --> 17:56.617
"Raffi, please stop
being bobbum man.

17:56.619 --> 17:57.785
Love, Taco.

17:57.787 --> 18:00.503
P.S. Racquetball on Sunday?"

18:00.623 --> 18:02.736
You're going to play racquetball
with Raffi on Sunday?

18:02.856 --> 18:04.325
Well, not if I can't find him.

18:06.351 --> 18:08.452
I mean, this is a
horrific situation.

18:08.454 --> 18:11.288
Truly, in the world, the last
person I would ever want to be

18:11.290 --> 18:12.823
sodomized by would be Raffi.

18:12.825 --> 18:13.890
Truly, if I could pick.

18:13.892 --> 18:16.727
Oh, and by the way, when you get
sodomized by a vagrant, not only

18:16.729 --> 18:19.930
are you sodomized by that
vagrant, but you're also being

18:19.932 --> 18:22.833
sodomized by everyone else
that vagrant has sodomized.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.902
Raffi's put this whole Bobbum
Man thing in the gutter.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.605
You know, as I envisioned Bobbum
Man, it was much more of a

18:27.607 --> 18:30.141
general annihilation,
not just about the ass.

18:30.143 --> 18:33.244
I mean, it includes that, but...
Oh, I'm so sorry your vision's been ruined,

18:33.246 --> 18:33.912
Shakespeare.

18:33.914 --> 18:36.915
Hey, sue me if I have a little,
uh, artistic integrity, okay?

18:36.917 --> 18:39.918
Just... how would you feel if we
took Mundane Ejaculation Man and

18:39.920 --> 18:41.854
just...
well, we just tossed him aside?

18:41.856 --> 18:46.425
Well, I wouldn't care, because I don't...
Um, there's some... Is that...

18:46.427 --> 18:48.561
That's... that's bobbum man.

18:48.563 --> 18:50.096
You know what, Ruxin?

18:50.098 --> 18:51.865
Thought you could
kick me out of yoga?

18:51.867 --> 18:54.234
Guess what-- I'm sneaking back
in, and I got a disguise.

18:54.236 --> 18:55.602
You know what I'm going to do?

18:55.604 --> 18:59.840
I'm going to reach fancy light-up nirvana,
and I'm going to beat your bobbum.

18:59.842 --> 19:00.875
That's right.

19:00.877 --> 19:06.346
I'm going to beat your bobbum like my
team is made out of equipmonk, okay?

19:06.348 --> 19:07.748
Go.

19:07.750 --> 19:08.882
Shit.

19:08.884 --> 19:09.883
Aah!

19:09.885 --> 19:11.117
bobbum man, bobbum man.

19:11.119 --> 19:12.685
Whoa, whoa!

19:12.687 --> 19:13.720
bobbum man, bobbum man!

19:13.722 --> 19:17.090
I'm going to beat that bobbum.

19:17.092 --> 19:19.893
I'm going to come in the back.

19:19.895 --> 19:20.760
Oh!

19:20.762 --> 19:22.462
And I'm going to
beat that bobbum.

19:22.464 --> 19:23.463
He's got a bag of equipmonk.

19:23.465 --> 19:25.132
I don't want to
go out like this.

19:25.134 --> 19:26.900
It's not the way I'm
supposed to die.

19:26.902 --> 19:28.769
Hey, we're not going
out like this.

19:28.771 --> 19:29.604
We can take him.

19:29.606 --> 19:30.605
Come on, it's two against one.

19:30.607 --> 19:32.440
Okay, you go, and
I'll tell your story.

19:32.442 --> 19:33.275
No!

19:33.277 --> 19:34.109
You're so brave.

19:34.111 --> 19:35.244
You hear me?

19:35.246 --> 19:36.612
Here we go.

19:36.614 --> 19:38.780
One, two, three.

19:42.619 --> 19:44.219
Die, Bobbum!

19:44.221 --> 19:47.922
How do you like your
equipmonk now, huh?

19:49.926 --> 19:51.592
Who are we kicking?

19:53.229 --> 19:54.795
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Raffi!

19:54.797 --> 19:55.629
Stop, stop, stop.

19:55.631 --> 19:56.463
What?

19:56.465 --> 19:57.331
That's not bobbum man.

19:57.333 --> 19:58.165
Oh, no.

19:58.167 --> 19:58.932
Hey, what's up?

19:58.934 --> 20:01.158
We're gonna get the crawfish...
That's the crawdad man!

20:01.278 --> 20:01.922
What?

20:04.790 --> 20:06.553
It's Andre.

20:06.673 --> 20:10.810
Relax.
Hey, stop, I'm me.

20:13.208 --> 20:15.010
Am I in Nirvana?

20:18.511 --> 20:19.771
Oh, boy.

20:19.891 --> 20:22.554
Okay, this is not good.
Okay, this is how it's gonna go down.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.070
We're gonna need to get a rug,

20:24.190 --> 20:27.164
a bonesaw and condoms.
What? He's not dead.

20:27.716 --> 20:30.435
Fine, then we don't need the condoms.
The other stuff we're gonna need.

20:30.692 --> 20:31.829
We're gonna kill him,

20:31.949 --> 20:33.008
get rid of the body,

20:33.128 --> 20:34.543
and then we're leaving the state tonight.

20:34.663 --> 20:37.285
This is how it ends, Ryan, get used to it.

20:37.405 --> 20:38.610
We're gonna have to change our names.

20:38.730 --> 20:39.864
I'm gonna be Apollo,

20:39.984 --> 20:41.985
you should be Scott,
you should be Kevin.

20:42.105 --> 20:44.523
Okay, let's start calling ourselves
those names now.
