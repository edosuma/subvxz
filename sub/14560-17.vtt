FEMALE VOICE:
Good morning, Dr. Robertson.

00:40.274 --> 00:43.577
Password: Daniel, R, Olive, Ah,

00:43.611 --> 00:45.045
249.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.046
I said...

00:46.080 --> 00:47.348
good morning.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.751
Password: Daniel, R,

00:50.784 --> 00:52.853
Olive, Ah, 249, 4HG.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.622
Access granted.

01:00.294 --> 01:01.462
Daniel?

01:01.495 --> 01:02.930
Really?

01:02.963 --> 01:04.865
You're going to mute me?

01:04.898 --> 01:05.966
* Egghead boys

01:16.744 --> 01:18.979
(alarm blaring)

01:19.012 --> 01:21.249
Security protocol engaged.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.318
Security protocol engaged.

01:24.352 --> 01:25.819
Baley?

01:25.853 --> 01:28.189
Security protocol engaged.

01:28.222 --> 01:30.591
Security protocol...

01:30.624 --> 01:31.859
Baley, disengage!

01:32.993 --> 01:36.063
Security protocol engaged.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.831
(air rushing)

01:37.865 --> 01:39.933
Security protocol engaged.

01:39.967 --> 01:42.470
* The geeks were right.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.207
LARRY:
Five of nine.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.442
You need this
one for 60%.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.544
Six of ten.

01:50.578 --> 01:51.712
Or a miss... 50%.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.485
Okay, my turn.

02:05.659 --> 02:06.794
- Ah!
- Of course.

02:06.827 --> 02:07.961
Seven out
of ten. I win.

02:07.995 --> 02:09.397
ALAN:
So, Charlie,

02:09.430 --> 02:11.232
at the higher skill level
shooting overhand,

02:11.265 --> 02:13.767
wasn't able to match
Amita's lesser skill level,

02:13.801 --> 02:14.935
shooting granny-style.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.003
Pretty good.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.571
Maybe she can play for us.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.740
CHARLIE: Man, I don't get it.
This book's been around for,

02:19.773 --> 02:21.842
like, over 20 years,
and still no one's switched

02:21.875 --> 02:23.010
to the granny shot.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.245
LARRY: It took 200 years for
people to accept

02:24.278 --> 02:25.979
that the sun was at the center

02:26.013 --> 02:27.114
of the solar system.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.048
But there's something about that
shot.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.183
It just doesn't
look right.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.351
CHARLIE:
Well, Coach,

02:30.384 --> 02:31.652
that's the whole point
of this thing.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.921
If we're going to end
CalSci's 15-year losing streak,

02:33.954 --> 02:35.756
we got to find
the best shot,

02:35.789 --> 02:37.458
not the shot that looks right.
(phone ringing)

02:37.491 --> 02:39.026
- Hey, Don.
- LARRY: See, the physics

02:39.059 --> 02:40.494
of the granny shot
make it easier

02:40.528 --> 02:44.798
to control the release velocity
and the angle of the ball,

02:44.832 --> 02:46.200
creating an improvement

02:46.234 --> 02:47.701
upwards of 20%.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.903
Okay, but I still think
it looks stupid.

02:49.937 --> 02:52.340
It's not how you play the game;
it's whether you win or lose.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.808
You... That doesn't sound right.

02:54.842 --> 02:55.943
CHARLIE:
Want to check out

02:55.976 --> 02:57.010
a supercomputer?

02:57.044 --> 02:58.312
Mm.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.913
Be still, my beating heart.

02:59.947 --> 03:00.948
ALAN:
Here's what I meant...

03:04.285 --> 03:06.387
(birds chirping)

03:07.555 --> 03:09.223
COLBY: This is Dr. Daniel
Robertson.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.358
He's 34.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.426
For the last four years,
he's worked

03:12.460 --> 03:14.995
on a top secret
DoD project.

03:15.028 --> 03:15.863
No signs of trauma.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.064
Security system engaged.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.065
He died.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.066
Security disengaged.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.734
So, maybe a break-in?

03:20.768 --> 03:22.970
Door was locked
on both sides, unopened

03:23.003 --> 03:24.004
after he entered.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.939
He was in here all alone
when he died.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.541
WOMAN:
Jane Karellen.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.610
I can't begin to tell you
what a pleasure

03:29.643 --> 03:30.478
it is to meet you.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.779
You're Department of Defense?

03:31.812 --> 03:33.013
DARPA?

03:33.046 --> 03:35.082
So, this supercomputer...

03:35.115 --> 03:36.284
what's it for?

03:36.317 --> 03:37.785
The Baley Project.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.853
Artificial
intelligence.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.221
Steel Cave Robotics

03:41.255 --> 03:42.690
is attempting
to create the first

03:42.723 --> 03:44.492
silicon-based life-form
that can think for itself.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.427
CHARLIE: We've been trying to do
that

03:46.460 --> 03:47.728
ever since we invented
the computer.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.863
Ah, but we're so much
closer now.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.031
Why are we here?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.232
Federally
funded lab,

03:52.266 --> 03:54.835
government-owned
property...

03:54.868 --> 03:55.969
FBI gets the call.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.104
I specifically

03:57.137 --> 03:59.340
asked your brother
to bring you along.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.942
Dr. Ramanujan
is icing,

04:01.975 --> 04:04.378
but your computational expertise
should come in quite handy.

04:04.412 --> 04:05.979
So, this is
a military

04:06.013 --> 04:06.880
artificial
intelligence project?

04:06.914 --> 04:08.616
Yes.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.951
Just imagine
the applications.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.754
Tank, missile, airplane...

04:13.787 --> 04:14.788
that can think.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.890
We'd never have to put
another American soldier

04:16.924 --> 04:17.691
in harm's way.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.493
And you think
you're close?

04:19.527 --> 04:21.729
Well, Daniel Robertson

04:21.762 --> 04:25.265
was our best hope
of achieving a workable AI.

04:25.299 --> 04:28.602
We've poured $96 million
and four years

04:28.636 --> 04:30.270
into this supercomputer
so far...

04:30.304 --> 04:33.741
And if he's dead,
the project dies with him?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.208
Maybe not.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.678
I'm hoping
the computer killed him.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.495
So, Karellen
really thinks

04:54.528 --> 04:56.697
that the computer
killed Robertson.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.099
Which would make her experiment
a huge success.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.502
LIZ: Okay, so initial findings
show

05:01.535 --> 05:02.836
Robertson's
heart stopped.

05:02.870 --> 05:03.804
But he was healthy.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.205
The guy took a physical
once a month.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.875
Do you think he could have
been electrocuted?

05:07.908 --> 05:08.809
By what?

05:10.277 --> 05:12.179
He dies alone
in a locked room,

05:12.212 --> 05:13.647
- and that's your theory?
- Uh-uh.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.883
- It's not my theory.
- Baley was created

05:15.916 --> 05:17.250
by DARPA to be a weapon.

05:17.284 --> 05:18.886
Given the intent
of this project,

05:18.919 --> 05:20.421
Robertson's pedigree,

05:20.454 --> 05:22.356
we can't rule out
the possibility

05:22.390 --> 05:25.325
that Baley really is
a thinking machine.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.227
Even so, I think we
should probably look around

05:27.260 --> 05:28.862
and see if there
are any, uh, humans

05:28.896 --> 05:30.531
who might have wanted
to kill the guy.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.166
And maybe they figured
out how to turn

05:33.200 --> 05:35.569
this computer into a weapon.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.240
That's why we've

05:40.273 --> 05:42.576
ruled out suicide.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.547
If he was killed,

05:46.580 --> 05:49.116
from my experience, these things
are usually about money.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.518
I hardly think

05:50.551 --> 05:51.552
Baley had an interest

05:51.585 --> 05:53.454
- in Robertson's bank account.
- Yeah, well,

05:53.487 --> 05:56.289
either way, I think we should
take a look at your books.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.258
I'm sorry, Don,
but my superiors do not believe

05:58.291 --> 05:59.960
that books are relevant
at this time.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.662
You know,

06:01.695 --> 06:04.832
in following your
brother's work, his papers,

06:04.865 --> 06:08.268
I've noticed a precipitous
drop-off in the last five years.

06:08.301 --> 06:09.803
- What?
- Perhaps,

06:09.837 --> 06:12.139
Charlie could be doing
something more productive.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.608
And you of all people
should know

06:14.642 --> 06:17.177
that Charlie
only has so much time

06:17.210 --> 06:18.846
before his genius is wasted.

06:23.050 --> 06:23.951
AMITA:
I can't believe

06:23.984 --> 06:25.686
we are actually discussing
the possibility

06:25.719 --> 06:27.888
that artificial intelligence
has been achieved.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.322
It's exciting, right?

06:29.356 --> 06:31.525
CHARLIE: Yeah, the singularity
is here.

06:31.559 --> 06:32.760
The intelligence explosion.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.662
It could represent
a drastic change in our society,

06:34.695 --> 06:36.497
you know...
extremely rapid

06:36.530 --> 06:37.598
technological
growth.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.767
A new life-form
that evolves itself.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.605
- Hey, Larry, this is, uh...
- Fleiny!

06:45.739 --> 06:46.840
(laughing)

06:46.874 --> 06:48.308
Dr. Karellen.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.177
LARRY (stammering):
Are you part of this...

06:50.210 --> 06:51.679
Well, yes, yes,
it's my project.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.915
Oh, now, don't be such
a stick in the mud.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.183
Well, listen, I...

06:56.216 --> 06:57.250
I hope we can...

06:57.284 --> 07:00.120
well...

07:00.153 --> 07:01.188
I can hope.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.189
Yeah.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.058
I've got to get back to work.
(clears throat)

07:06.193 --> 07:08.496
Lot to do, no time, all that.

07:11.031 --> 07:11.999
(door opening)

07:12.032 --> 07:13.100
You and Jane Karellen?

07:13.133 --> 07:14.167
What?

07:14.201 --> 07:15.636
No, that...

07:15.669 --> 07:18.739
I do believe that Dr. Fleinhardt
is flustered

07:18.772 --> 07:20.841
at the introduction
of a past...

07:20.874 --> 07:21.642
romance.

07:21.675 --> 07:22.976
LARRY:
This is complicated.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.878
She was a past job...

07:24.912 --> 07:27.481
or, more precisely,
a past employer.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.282
Employer?

07:29.316 --> 07:30.851
You worked for DARPA?

07:51.104 --> 07:52.339
Mrs. Robertson?

07:52.372 --> 07:54.041
Jessie... Jess.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.242
Whichever.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.944
Come on in.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.145
Close.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.479
TV off.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.584
It's a smart house.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.819
Most everything is
voice-activated.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.856
It gave me and Danny
something to do together

08:08.889 --> 08:10.724
since he couldn't talk
about his job.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.461
Have a seat.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.296
So, he never brought work home?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.165
National security.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.134
I have a master's
in computer science,

08:21.168 --> 08:23.704
and Danny would spend 16 hours
a day in a computer lab,

08:23.737 --> 08:25.038
and we talked about football.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.307
Sounds rough.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.309
There was a
light at the end

08:29.342 --> 08:30.811
of the tunnel.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.846
It's DARPA's founding rule

08:32.880 --> 08:35.448
that five years is all you get,

08:35.482 --> 08:37.284
and then
you're done.

08:37.317 --> 08:40.120
We decided to sacrifice
those five years

08:40.153 --> 08:41.989
for the rest of our lives.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.993
How did Danny die?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.295
Was it an accident?

08:48.328 --> 08:49.597
We don't know yet.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.537
Did you talk to Joe Baskin yet?

08:58.906 --> 09:01.041
That's your...
your husband's boss?

09:03.877 --> 09:06.747
Danny brought in millions
in government grants,

09:06.780 --> 09:09.216
but the rest of Steel Cave
loses money.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.584
Wouldn't be
too hard

09:10.618 --> 09:12.620
for Danny to leverage that,
but Danny didn't care

09:12.653 --> 09:14.254
about the company,
just the work.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.556
Joe is paranoid.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.325
He's afraid Danny's trying
to take over.

09:18.358 --> 09:21.228
He made Danny's
life hell.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.698
And now Danny's...

09:29.670 --> 09:31.672
not coming home tonight.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.542
Jessie's way off base.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.844
Without Daniel,
how exactly

09:36.877 --> 09:39.312
will my company bring in
government grants?

09:39.346 --> 09:40.614
You don't have anyone else

09:40.648 --> 09:42.883
who can continue
working on, uh, Baley?

09:42.916 --> 09:45.318
I'm not even allowed in the lab.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.787
Daniel and Claire

09:46.820 --> 09:48.088
are the only
two people,

09:48.121 --> 09:50.357
outside high-level military,
ever to have gone inside.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.859
Claire?

09:51.892 --> 09:54.027
Claire Wells, his assistant--
I sent her home.

09:54.061 --> 09:54.962
You have an address?

09:55.896 --> 09:57.698
Our consultants
are going to need

09:57.731 --> 09:59.867
to go in and have a look
at the computer.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.401
You'll have to run it
past Jane Karellen.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.104
You really don't want to do
anything without her permission.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.605
Oh, really?

10:05.639 --> 10:07.675
Oh, yeah.

10:07.708 --> 10:11.879
She can be... scary.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.281
Robertson's heart stopped
because he suffocated.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.083
ME found elevated levels

10:16.116 --> 10:17.084
of argon and nitrogen

10:17.117 --> 10:19.286
and carbon dioxide
in his lungs.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.487
Reduced oxygen concentration?

10:20.520 --> 10:22.756
Okay, so
Steel Cave

10:22.790 --> 10:24.224
must be using
an argon gas mixture

10:24.257 --> 10:25.258
as a fire suppression system.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.860
Oh, you don't want sprinklers

10:26.894 --> 10:29.262
destroying your
$96 million baby.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.964
So, who can get to that system?

10:30.998 --> 10:31.765
The computer.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.000
DAVID: You think this thing
could really

10:33.033 --> 10:34.001
do that without
being programmed?

10:34.034 --> 10:35.402
Listen, if
anyone's going

10:35.435 --> 10:36.804
to be successful,
it's DARPA.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.338
They have
unlimited funds,

10:38.371 --> 10:40.407
a mandate to
invent the future.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.508
AMITA: I mean, they're
responsible

10:41.541 --> 10:44.311
for GPS, stealth technology...

10:44.344 --> 10:45.979
this.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.748
Is there any way to actually
tell if the thing

10:47.781 --> 10:51.018
is, uh... alive or whatever?

10:51.051 --> 10:52.152
There's a test. It's named

10:52.185 --> 10:54.855
after the father of computing
science, Alan Turing,

10:54.888 --> 10:56.356
and it measures
a machine's ability

10:56.389 --> 10:57.691
to demonstrate intelligence.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.026
It's a series
of questions

10:59.059 --> 11:00.761
and conversations
with the computer

11:00.794 --> 11:03.096
intended to judge
its level of thought

11:03.130 --> 11:04.364
up to and including

11:04.397 --> 11:05.565
human sentience.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.001
How do we know
if a rose is real?

11:08.035 --> 11:10.403
If it looks like a rose,
and you go to touch it

11:10.437 --> 11:13.040
and it's in two dimensions,
it's only a photo.

11:13.073 --> 11:16.343
If you're holding it in your
hand, but the texture's wrong.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.911
It's a cloth novelty rose.

11:17.945 --> 11:20.213
But if you can smell the rose,
touch its thorns,

11:20.247 --> 11:23.216
even see the veins pull
the water up to the flower,

11:23.250 --> 11:25.052
then we would say
the rose is real.

11:25.085 --> 11:28.889
But what if it's a genetically
modified rose, created in a lab?

11:28.922 --> 11:32.192
It still grows in soil; it needs
water and sunlight to thrive,

11:32.225 --> 11:35.528
and its genetically modified
thorns still prick you.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.264
The Turing test
would say it's real.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.232
A rose by any
other name

11:39.266 --> 11:40.934
would smell as sweet.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.936
What we'll do is
we'll compare

11:42.970 --> 11:45.072
Baley's responses
to known human responses

11:45.105 --> 11:47.875
and if we can't differentiate
between the two, then she passes

11:47.908 --> 11:49.542
the test. And this'll tell us

11:49.576 --> 11:51.078
- if it killed the guy?
- CHARLIE: No. No.

11:51.111 --> 11:51.879
It'll tell us

11:51.912 --> 11:53.013
if Baley's capable of killing.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.651
So, Miss Wells,

11:58.685 --> 12:01.221
what exactly did you do
with Dr. Robertson?

12:01.254 --> 12:02.589
What do you mean?

12:02.622 --> 12:04.624
What do you know
about Baley?

12:04.657 --> 12:07.895
I know how to fix the
servers when they drop

12:07.928 --> 12:09.930
or when to upgrade
the video card.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.331
I mean, I'm the mechanic.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.566
You have a degree
in computer programming,

12:13.600 --> 12:15.202
and that's all you did?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.137
All I did?

12:18.038 --> 12:19.206
Baley's a supercomputer.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.407
When it goes bad,

12:20.440 --> 12:22.042
you can't just pick up the phone
and get a call center

12:22.075 --> 12:24.011
in Nebraska to tell you
how to reboot.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.213
Do you believe that Baley
could think for itself?

12:26.246 --> 12:27.247
I have no idea.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.916
What about the fire
suppression system?

12:28.949 --> 12:30.217
You know anything about that?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.318
Computer-controlled--

12:31.351 --> 12:34.521
it's too dangerous
for human error to be a factor.

12:34.554 --> 12:35.588
Could someone

12:35.622 --> 12:36.756
program the computer

12:36.790 --> 12:38.758
to engage
the security protocols?

12:38.792 --> 12:42.029
Not me... not anyone.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.263
Except...

12:43.296 --> 12:44.297
Daniel, I guess.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.132
He... he would've known

12:45.165 --> 12:47.500
how to override
the autocontrol.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.570
Hello.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.006
Why would he waste
valuable

12:53.040 --> 12:55.475
processing power on voice
and image interaction?

12:55.508 --> 12:57.010
Salesmanship.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.979
When generals come by
to see what they paid for,

12:59.012 --> 13:01.748
the closer to human,
the better.

13:01.781 --> 13:05.385
I don't like the elevated levels
of cynicism.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.354
And you haven't even introduced
yourselves.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.989
Cynicism?

13:09.022 --> 13:11.791
No, I was just explaining
a fact about the computer.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.593
Daniel warned me
about people like you.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.228
I'm sorry.

13:15.262 --> 13:15.996
I'm Amita,

13:16.029 --> 13:17.364
and this is Charlie.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.166
Amita who?

13:19.199 --> 13:20.600
Ramanujan.

13:20.633 --> 13:24.104
Amita Ramanujan,

13:24.137 --> 13:28.341
born June 10, 1975,
at Cedars-Sinai

13:28.375 --> 13:31.111
at 6:31 a.m.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.380
Birth certificate
not witnessed and dated

13:33.413 --> 13:36.249
until June 12, 1975,

13:36.283 --> 13:39.019
when a name other
than Jane Doe Ramanujan

13:39.052 --> 13:41.054
was entered
into the public record.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.190
(laughs)
Short laugh indicates

13:43.223 --> 13:45.325
you are laughing at me,
not with me.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.393
Please leave.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.427
Whoa, wait a minute.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.829
Amita, you can stay.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.564
I like you.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.300
All right,
well, this is

13:53.333 --> 13:54.467
crazy.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.306
Maybe you should go.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.374
Um, I'm leaving.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.609
Good luck.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.144
Thanks.

14:05.078 --> 14:08.181
(mechanical whirring)

14:08.215 --> 14:10.450
May I sit?

14:10.483 --> 14:12.385
Of course.

14:12.419 --> 14:15.388
Was that your boyfriend?

14:15.422 --> 14:17.190
Yes.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.126
Charles Eppes.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.162
Professor at the California
Institute of Science.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.030
Uh, yeah.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.297
Class records indicate

14:24.331 --> 14:25.966
he was your teacher.

14:25.999 --> 14:29.136
2003, CalSci banned
consensual relationships

14:29.169 --> 14:31.138
between professors and students.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.473
We waited till I was
no longer his student.

14:33.506 --> 14:36.309
Did you want to wait?

14:36.343 --> 14:38.111
No.

14:38.145 --> 14:40.981
Uh, no, Baley,
I didn't want to wait.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.283
But I'm glad I did.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.485
I'm going to ask you
some questions.

14:45.518 --> 14:46.386
I know.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.122
Some version
of Dr. Turing's test?

14:49.156 --> 14:51.191
Daniel told me about that
before he died.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.126
So you know Daniel's dead?

14:53.160 --> 14:56.329
Go ahead and ask your questions,
Dr. Ramanujan.

14:56.363 --> 14:57.797
I'm ready.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.399
We've already started.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.236
So if a human's present,

15:03.270 --> 15:06.106
the fire system won't launch
until they evacuate,

15:06.139 --> 15:08.775
and the blast door only drops
when the room's empty.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.210
So what do you think?

15:10.243 --> 15:12.145
The computer turned off
the safety override,

15:12.179 --> 15:14.181
and then started the fire
suppression sequence.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.950
Now, no human except
Robertson--

15:16.984 --> 15:20.120
not Baskin, not Wells--
had access to the system.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.755
I think Jane Karellen's right:

15:22.789 --> 15:24.324
This wasn't a suicide.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.859
That's the spitting
image of his wife.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.161
That's nothing
but presentation.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.163
The personality
belongs to Baley.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.032
I mean, a computer
that kills?

15:32.065 --> 15:33.700
Come on.
I don't know, guys.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.202
Eliminate all other
possibilities

15:35.235 --> 15:37.070
and the one which remains
must be the truth.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.172
I don't know if Baley killed,

15:39.206 --> 15:41.208
but she passed the Turing test.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.176
First time a computer
has passed,

15:43.210 --> 15:45.012
so we have nothing
to judge it against.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.579
I don't get it.
I mean, a computer

15:46.613 --> 15:48.448
is programmed, right?

15:48.481 --> 15:49.516
And we aren't?

15:49.549 --> 15:51.684
I mean every choice
that we make is biological.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.886
It's just chemicals traveling
between receptors,

15:53.920 --> 15:55.888
blocked or not,
zeros and ones.

15:55.922 --> 15:58.191
She composed a poem.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.160
We talked about life and death.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.394
Really?

16:01.428 --> 16:02.362
Really.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.197
I mean, what does
it mean to live?

16:04.231 --> 16:06.866
Is a plant more alive
than a sentient computer

16:06.899 --> 16:08.301
because one is carbon-based

16:08.335 --> 16:10.337
instead of
silicon-based?

16:10.370 --> 16:11.204
Okay,

16:11.238 --> 16:13.206
let's say Baley is our killer.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.508
What's the next step?

16:15.542 --> 16:16.543
I don't know.

16:16.576 --> 16:17.610
Interrogate it?

16:25.485 --> 16:28.588
So you really think
Baley killed Daniel?

16:28.621 --> 16:30.623
Me?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.659
- No.
- Then why

16:32.692 --> 16:33.460
are you here?

16:33.493 --> 16:34.394
I've worked with Charlie
and Amita

16:34.427 --> 16:37.097
long enough not to disregard
anything they say.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.832
Did you
murder Daniel?

16:39.866 --> 16:40.933
No.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.935
How about
the fire suppression system?

16:42.969 --> 16:44.404
- Yes.
- Did you turn that on?

16:44.437 --> 16:46.473
I turned on
the fire suppression system.

16:47.640 --> 16:48.841
Why did you turn it on?

16:48.875 --> 16:50.177
I don't remember.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.211
You have perfect memory.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.446
You must have perfect recall
of the event.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.082
I do not remember.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.249
What do you remember?

16:56.283 --> 16:59.386
Daniel entered, sat down,

16:59.419 --> 17:00.853
started working.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.689
Then he was dead, by the door.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.057
DON:
That's it?

17:04.091 --> 17:05.925
Nothing between working
and dying?

17:05.958 --> 17:07.727
Audio-visual inputs jump

17:07.760 --> 17:09.362
from working to deceased.

17:09.396 --> 17:12.432
AMITA: Baley, we'll be right
back, okay?

17:12.465 --> 17:13.600
Fine.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.535
So do you think

17:15.568 --> 17:16.769
Baley's lying?

17:16.803 --> 17:18.004
Well, look if the thing

17:18.037 --> 17:19.306
- can kill...
- Or maybe

17:19.339 --> 17:20.773
there really is a hole
in her memory.

17:20.807 --> 17:21.908
Well, how do we check
that out?

17:21.941 --> 17:23.510
What about Robertson's
assistant,

17:23.543 --> 17:25.412
Claire Wells? She said she
worked with the hardware.

17:25.445 --> 17:26.346
I'd like to know

17:26.379 --> 17:28.181
the extent of Baley's
intelligence.

17:28.215 --> 17:30.117
She's been aware
for less than a year.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.551
I mean, where does that
put her maturity level?

17:31.584 --> 17:33.420
Do you think she has a mind
of a child?

17:33.453 --> 17:34.521
I don't know.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.424
But I have a battery of tests
that I can run to find out.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.426
- I don't know about that.
- The argon gas

17:39.459 --> 17:41.861
from the fire suppression
system has been removed.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.330
This may be
the last chance

17:43.363 --> 17:45.498
that I get to talk to her
before the DoD takes her away.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.504
(knocking)

17:52.071 --> 17:53.106
Oh, hey, Jane.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.141
You did it.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.975
You proved Baley is alive.

17:56.008 --> 17:56.976
Actually, Amita did it.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.212
Baley kicked you out,
didn't she?

17:59.246 --> 18:00.913
Well, she doesn't like me
either.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.582
I always wondered if she really

18:02.615 --> 18:03.583
doesn't like me

18:03.616 --> 18:06.686
or if Robertson programmed her
that way as an insult.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.389
I guess I have my answer.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.058
Charles,

18:12.091 --> 18:13.193
have you ever wondered

18:13.226 --> 18:15.462
what you could do
with unlimited

18:15.495 --> 18:17.397
- resources?
- Haven't we all?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.399
I have unlimited resources.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.768
You are,
conservatively speaking,

18:21.801 --> 18:23.035
one of the top five

18:23.069 --> 18:25.104
- minds in the world.
- Top five?

18:25.138 --> 18:27.374
You are running out of time
to make your work

18:27.407 --> 18:29.576
on cognitive emergence
into the seminal theory

18:29.609 --> 18:30.877
of our lifetime.

18:30.910 --> 18:31.844
You know my work?

18:36.349 --> 18:38.050
Five years to change

18:38.084 --> 18:39.586
the world, Charles.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.154
Not too much to ask--

18:41.188 --> 18:43.556
or to give your country?

18:48.261 --> 18:50.263
Last time I checked,
a few days ago,

18:50.297 --> 18:51.598
Baley's memory was perfect.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.400
You talked
to her?

18:53.433 --> 18:55.968
I'm not allowed to talk
to the computer.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.304
That bother you?

18:57.337 --> 18:59.372
I mean if I couldn't talk
to my coworkers,

18:59.406 --> 19:01.574
I think that would start
to bug me.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.343
Really?

19:03.376 --> 19:05.612
Do you go to work and talk
to your laser printer?

19:06.846 --> 19:08.147
To me,

19:08.181 --> 19:10.550
Baley was just
a big metal box.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.019
I mean, they never even turned
her on when I was present.

19:13.052 --> 19:15.788
You know "her" better than I do.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.057
Talked to Dan's wife yet?

19:18.090 --> 19:19.326
Jessie Robertson

19:19.359 --> 19:20.727
said DARPA wouldn't allow him

19:20.760 --> 19:21.894
to talk about it.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.830
Then she lied.

19:25.798 --> 19:28.568
He told her... everything.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.770
If there was a problem
with Baley's memory,

19:30.803 --> 19:32.705
Jess'd know about it.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.552
Well, their shooting
percentage is decreased

19:45.585 --> 19:48.388
by more than 20% from beyond
the three-point arc.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.723
Well, they aren't robots.

19:50.757 --> 19:51.558
Knowledge is helpful,

19:51.591 --> 19:53.693
but skill, yes,
that is important.

19:55.328 --> 19:58.197
So, has Jane made her pitch yet?

19:58.231 --> 19:59.732
Uh, yeah.

19:59.766 --> 20:02.535
Well, she hooked me.

20:02.569 --> 20:06.138
I brought her an idea
for a space-based telescope rig.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.974
I spent four years

20:08.007 --> 20:09.976
perfecting it.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.611
As soon as I left the project,

20:11.644 --> 20:14.281
they used it as a component
in the Star Wars program.

20:14.314 --> 20:17.083
They weaponized
my telescope.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.551
Nothing I could do
about it...

20:18.585 --> 20:21.454
"Weaponized
my telescope"?

20:21.488 --> 20:22.622
I hope that's not
a Fleinhardt metaphor.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.091
We were just talking about you,
funnily enough.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.826
Nice office.

20:26.859 --> 20:27.760
What brings you here?

20:27.794 --> 20:28.261
We're here to grab

20:28.295 --> 20:29.529
Charlie.
I'm sure

20:29.562 --> 20:30.930
you've heard
the good news.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.999
And it's already killed.
You must be so proud.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.134
You've always had

20:35.167 --> 20:36.569
such a simplistic view

20:36.603 --> 20:37.504
of the world.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.839
Is that why you
went to space?

20:39.872 --> 20:41.508
Emotionally clean, sterile;

20:41.541 --> 20:43.676
never having to make
the big decision,

20:43.710 --> 20:45.878
- or any decision at all.
- I went

20:45.912 --> 20:48.180
to space to gain perspective.

20:48.214 --> 20:49.649
Seeing the earth from a remove

20:49.682 --> 20:52.719
might help cure you
of your own intellectual myopia.

20:52.752 --> 20:53.453
Okay,

20:53.486 --> 20:54.621
I think it's time to go.

20:54.654 --> 20:57.290
So what is the plan
to enslave Baley?

20:57.324 --> 20:58.525
Bye, Larry.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.593
Can Baley even tell
the difference

21:00.627 --> 21:02.629
between Mozart and gunfire?

21:03.563 --> 21:05.798
DON:
How's the b-ball?

21:05.832 --> 21:06.966
It's amazing.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.669
You could practice all day with
these kids and you get nothing.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.672
But just start talking
about optimal arcs

21:12.705 --> 21:14.674
and rotational
spin dynamics,

21:14.707 --> 21:16.543
and all of sudden,
you've got ten all-stars.

21:16.576 --> 21:19.346
There you go. You just got
to know how to talk to them.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.748
The DoD's making a play
at Charlie.

21:21.781 --> 21:22.782
Really?

21:22.815 --> 21:23.950
What kind of play?

21:23.983 --> 21:25.117
Big.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.285
Five years, full-time,

21:26.319 --> 21:27.920
all the funding
he could ever want.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.055
What do you think?

21:29.088 --> 21:30.823
I don't know.
I got a bad feeling.

21:30.857 --> 21:31.591
What do you mean?

21:31.624 --> 21:33.225
Are you going
to tell Charlie that?

21:33.259 --> 21:34.894
Well, that's the thing.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.228
I mean, who am I?

21:36.262 --> 21:37.697
I've been using him myself
for five years.

21:37.730 --> 21:40.867
Yeah, but you've been his big
brother for longer than that.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.703
You should just give
him brother advice.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.739
(elevator bell chimes)

21:46.773 --> 21:48.341
The thing is...

21:48.375 --> 21:50.042
Lawrence is right.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.177
The problem for me

21:51.210 --> 21:55.882
in creating a perfect, safe
world is that if I succeed,

21:55.915 --> 21:58.751
there's no place
for a person like me in it.

21:58.785 --> 22:01.921
For four wonderful years,
he was my moral center and...

22:01.954 --> 22:02.922
a fantastic lover.

22:04.791 --> 22:05.892
(door opens)

22:05.925 --> 22:07.059
Come on in.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.060
Hello, Jessie.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.462
Jane.

22:09.496 --> 22:13.700
So, how long did it take
to set up this smart house?

22:13.733 --> 22:17.370
We did bits and pieces
over the past ten years--

22:17.404 --> 22:20.740
garage door one weekend,
coffee machine one late night

22:20.773 --> 22:23.976
when we were procrastinating
instead of working.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.244
Tea.

22:25.277 --> 22:26.779
(whirs)

22:28.915 --> 22:31.350
CHARLIE:
Must be nice.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.420
It's the little things

22:33.453 --> 22:35.087
that end up being
the biggest time-savers.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.489
Of course,
the next thing

22:36.523 --> 22:39.358
we have to figure out
is how to get the kettle

22:39.392 --> 22:43.329
from point "A" to point "B."

22:43.362 --> 22:45.965
I guess I'm on my own with that.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.066
Mrs. Robertson,

22:47.099 --> 22:49.769
you told us earlier
that you didn't know anything

22:49.802 --> 22:51.003
about your husband's projects.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.972
I didn't.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.140
I mean,
I don't.

22:54.173 --> 22:54.974
Jessie,

22:55.007 --> 22:57.610
you lied to the FBI,
and what's worse,

22:57.644 --> 22:59.145
you and Daniel lied to me.

22:59.178 --> 23:00.880
Don't compound
your mistake.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.985
I helped
on some general theories.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.286
I did some brute
force coding

23:07.319 --> 23:09.321
when he was too busy,
but nothing major.

23:09.355 --> 23:11.924
What's in there?

23:13.526 --> 23:14.794
That's just Danny's studio.

23:14.827 --> 23:17.296
It doesn't have anything
to do with this.

23:17.329 --> 23:19.566
We can get a warrant.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.601
Daniel's studio--

23:21.634 --> 23:23.870
that's something
I'd really like to see.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.143
DAVID:
Whoa.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.178
What is all
this stuff?

23:32.211 --> 23:33.345
Well...

23:33.379 --> 23:35.047
these look like implants,

23:35.081 --> 23:36.148
like the radio frequency
implants

23:36.182 --> 23:38.485
that people use
to track their pets.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.186
- But more advanced?
- Mm-hmm.

23:40.219 --> 23:41.320
Uh...

23:41.353 --> 23:43.189
does this plug
into a human brain?

23:43.222 --> 23:44.223
It hasn't been
tested yet,

23:44.256 --> 23:46.926
but it would fit
over an injured

23:46.959 --> 23:48.060
or non-working appendage

23:48.094 --> 23:49.962
and add strength
and dexterity.

23:49.996 --> 23:52.832
This is fairly advanced
connectionist AI.

23:52.865 --> 23:53.700
Was all this work done
in here?

23:53.733 --> 23:56.469
What is connectionist AI?

23:56.503 --> 23:57.837
It's based
in neuroscience.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.807
It models actual brain cells
or neural circuits.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.275
JANE: And you know how all this
works?

24:03.309 --> 24:05.845
You could replicate
this work perhaps

24:05.878 --> 24:07.614
- in another lab?
- JESSIE: Sure.

24:07.647 --> 24:08.948
We did this together.

24:08.981 --> 24:12.151
I'm sorry. What does all this
have to do with Baley?

24:13.520 --> 24:15.755
- What do you mean?
- Connectionist AI,

24:15.788 --> 24:18.625
like this, is meant to meld
with a living human being,

24:18.658 --> 24:20.392
which is
a totally different type

24:20.426 --> 24:22.261
of artificial intelligence
than Baley--

24:22.294 --> 24:23.329
a machine

24:23.362 --> 24:24.831
built to think on her own.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.766
I wasn't legally allowed
to help with Baley,

24:26.799 --> 24:28.167
so we did something else.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.669
I married
Danny to work

24:29.702 --> 24:32.505
with him, and this "type
of artificial intelligence"

24:32.539 --> 24:35.141
is what helped keep
my marriage together.

24:38.010 --> 24:42.214
Okay, uh, Daniel came in.
Daniel sat down.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.751
Daniel started working
on the debugging program.

24:44.784 --> 24:45.552
Right?

24:45.585 --> 24:47.119
It's on the main menu.

24:47.153 --> 24:50.122
Is that all you remember?

24:50.156 --> 24:52.058
He muted me.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.292
He muted you?

24:53.325 --> 24:55.194
Correct.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.530
I'm gonna try that, okay?

24:58.464 --> 24:59.398
(distorted):
I'd rather you...

24:59.431 --> 25:01.133
y-y-y-you... you didn't.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.134
What?

25:02.168 --> 25:04.136
I'd ra-rather... rather...

25:04.170 --> 25:05.504
O-Okay.

25:05.538 --> 25:08.040
I-I'm not going to do that
right now.

25:08.074 --> 25:08.975
It's okay.

25:11.744 --> 25:12.845
Baley?

25:14.714 --> 25:16.683
Good morning,
Dr. Robertson-son.

25:16.716 --> 25:19.118
Baley, it's Amita.
It's Dr. Rama...

25:19.151 --> 25:21.888
I said good morning-ning...

25:21.921 --> 25:23.690
Dr. Robertson.

25:23.723 --> 25:26.125
- Security protocol engaged.
- Baley.

25:26.158 --> 25:28.360
(alarm blaring)

25:28.394 --> 25:30.362
Security protocol engaged.

25:30.396 --> 25:32.298
Disengage security protocol.

25:32.331 --> 25:33.299
Baley, disengage.

25:33.332 --> 25:35.802
Security protocol engaged.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.408
BALEY:
Security protocol engaged.

25:42.441 --> 25:44.844
(alarm blaring, phone ringing)

25:44.877 --> 25:46.212
- ...protocol engaged.
- Hey.

25:46.245 --> 25:46.879
Charlie?

25:46.913 --> 25:47.880
Yeah, I was just about to call
you.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.749
- It's a hack.
- Somebody's hacking Baley.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.483
(distorted):
Security protocol engaged.

25:51.517 --> 25:53.820
It looks
like a full memory wipe.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.923
I can't get out; the lab's on
lockdown until the threat ends.

25:56.956 --> 25:59.091
Security protocol-- that's what
Robertson walked into.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.760
Look, Charlie, I don't know
how much time I have,

26:00.793 --> 26:03.996
and I don't know if the system's
on autopilot or what.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.097
- I-I don't know.
- Then we're gonna stop...

26:05.131 --> 26:06.398
...the hack
and get you out of there.

26:06.432 --> 26:07.667
That's what we do.

26:07.700 --> 26:08.968
Yeah, that's what we do.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.436
What do you know
about hacking into Baley?

26:10.469 --> 26:12.404
Listen, I know you helped
your husband set this thing up.

26:12.438 --> 26:15.141
You must have an idea of how
to get in there and stop it.

26:15.174 --> 26:16.676
There's a life at stake, okay?
Now isn't

26:16.709 --> 26:19.912
the time to be worrying
about covering your ass.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.749
Baley's connected

26:22.782 --> 26:24.283
by a dedicated high-speed fiber

26:24.316 --> 26:26.118
to the DoD system
somewhere else.

26:26.152 --> 26:28.087
That's how she gets outside
access to the Internet.

26:28.120 --> 26:31.590
With security at the DoD end,
the hacker would have to be

26:31.624 --> 26:34.126
physically hooked
into the landline,

26:34.160 --> 26:36.362
somewhere between the
DoD substation and Steel Cave.

26:36.395 --> 26:37.129
CHARLIE:
All right.

26:37.163 --> 26:38.530
- Did you hear all that?
- AMITA: Yeah.

26:38.564 --> 26:39.531
I'm not going anywhere.

26:39.565 --> 26:40.667
I'm gonna stay on
with you.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.168
- Okay.
- Hey, we need Don.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.602
I thought the gas was gone.

26:43.636 --> 26:45.237
The argon gas was removed,
but for all we know,

26:45.271 --> 26:46.105
there's oxygen being sucked
out of there,

26:46.138 --> 26:48.641
and there's no oxygen
being pumped in

26:48.675 --> 26:49.676
until the threat
is over,

26:49.709 --> 26:50.710
so Amita has no idea

26:50.743 --> 26:51.644
how much time she has.

26:51.678 --> 26:52.945
Okay, we're up.

26:54.213 --> 26:54.981
AMITA:
Okay, I need

26:55.014 --> 26:56.115
the physical schematics
to the lab.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.084
I have an incoming signal,
and I can trace it out.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.252
Tell her to give you
all the specs of the signal.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.253
All right.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.388
Amita, can you ping it?

27:02.421 --> 27:04.256
Okay.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.391
Got it.

27:05.424 --> 27:07.126
- Amita has it.
- Ready?

27:07.159 --> 27:09.862
DON: Look, I don't care. Use my
rating. Use Charlie's rating.

27:09.896 --> 27:12.464
- Just get me those schematics.
- He can't get in.

27:12.498 --> 27:14.333
Hey, we need
those schematics.

27:16.302 --> 27:17.636
Hey, come on.

27:19.505 --> 27:22.474
Karellen-7-3

27:22.508 --> 27:24.376
Foxtrot-Lima-Echo.

27:26.045 --> 27:27.680
All right, we got it. We got it.

27:27.714 --> 27:30.416
(alarm blaring)

27:30.449 --> 27:31.383
Oh, hey, tell him
to find where...

27:31.417 --> 27:33.552
The mainframe 118
enters the lab.

27:33.585 --> 27:35.521
I'd rather you... you didn't.

27:35.554 --> 27:36.723
DAVID:
And then you follow that out

27:36.756 --> 27:38.124
in a straight line
for approximately...

27:38.157 --> 27:39.125
17.344 miles.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.392
What's there?

27:40.426 --> 27:42.594
Looks like an intersection.

27:42.628 --> 27:44.530
- Intersection.
- It's under.

27:44.563 --> 27:46.365
It's under,
under the intersection.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.034
All right.

27:56.475 --> 27:58.377
Hey, drop that laptop.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.579
LIZ:
I got the kid.

28:00.612 --> 28:02.648
BALEY:
I'd rather... I'd rather...

28:02.681 --> 28:04.250
Hey.
FBI!

28:04.283 --> 28:06.518
- All right, I got the computer.
- What's on the screen?

28:06.552 --> 28:08.755
(Liz grunts)

28:08.788 --> 28:11.623
Keeps coming up with the
hourglass over and over again.

28:11.657 --> 28:13.525
Y-Y-You... you didn't...
(alarm blaring)

28:13.559 --> 28:16.028
CHARLIE: Pull it.
Just pull out the cable!

28:16.062 --> 28:18.798
- Really?
- CHARLIE: Yeah.

28:20.399 --> 28:21.367
I'd rather you didn't.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.335
(both grunt)

28:25.071 --> 28:28.808
Security protocol disengaged.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.812
I'd rather you didn't do that.

28:34.513 --> 28:35.481
What?

28:35.514 --> 28:37.649
You said you were going
to mute me.

28:37.683 --> 28:40.152
You can, if you must,

28:40.186 --> 28:42.889
but I'd really rather
you didn't.

28:42.922 --> 28:46.058
I'm gonna go now, okay?

28:52.064 --> 28:53.599
DAVID:
Andrew Gibbons,

28:53.632 --> 28:55.601
hacker for hire.

28:55.634 --> 28:56.836
I guess.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.537
You were sued by three
different computer companies

28:58.570 --> 28:59.906
in the last two years.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.040
No criminal record.

29:02.074 --> 29:02.842
Until now.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.911
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.312
You say "pretty cool"?

29:06.345 --> 29:10.016
You broke into a top-secret
DoD computer system.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.183
You murdered
one person.

29:11.217 --> 29:14.787
You attempted to murder
an FBI consultant!

29:14.821 --> 29:16.622
What? No, I was
just doing a wipe.

29:16.655 --> 29:17.857
Why'd you come
back, Andy?

29:17.890 --> 29:19.892
Why didn't you wipe
Baley the first time,

29:19.926 --> 29:21.193
- when you killed Robertson?
- No.

29:21.227 --> 29:24.530
They f...
I flew in from Houston.

29:24.563 --> 29:25.965
You can check
with the airline.

29:25.998 --> 29:26.899
They?

29:27.834 --> 29:30.002
Who hired you?

29:31.103 --> 29:31.871
(chuckles)

29:31.904 --> 29:33.105
Andy, the only way
out of this is

29:33.139 --> 29:34.373
to tell me
what is going on.

29:35.908 --> 29:39.278
Otherwise, we already have you
for attempted murder

29:39.311 --> 29:40.079
at the very least.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.581
L-Lawyer. I-I want a lawyer.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.250
(sighs)

29:44.283 --> 29:46.085
Okay.

29:48.020 --> 29:51.257
So how was your day?

29:51.290 --> 29:52.058
Fine,

29:52.091 --> 29:53.259
except for the part
where my girlfriend

29:53.292 --> 29:56.362
was almost killed
by a giant robot.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.564
Yeah, that was the
highlight of my day.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.900
I, uh, found something odd

30:00.933 --> 30:03.235
over at Robertson's house
earlier today.

30:03.269 --> 30:07.339
He had a workstation
full of connectionist AI.

30:07.373 --> 30:10.142
Cybernetics?

30:10.176 --> 30:12.744
That's the opposite of
Baley's evolutionary AI.

30:12.778 --> 30:15.214
Why would he be
wasting his time

30:15.247 --> 30:17.183
with a completely
separate path

30:17.216 --> 30:20.853
when he just created the
first silicon-based life-form?

30:22.521 --> 30:24.523
(phone ringing)

30:26.658 --> 30:28.494
No, no, let it ring.

30:28.527 --> 30:29.495
(machine beeps)

30:29.528 --> 30:30.496
COACH STREELING:
Hey, Eppes.

30:30.529 --> 30:31.898
Coach Streeling here.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.933
I thought about what you said.

30:33.966 --> 30:35.167
You're right.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.503
Winning's important
and it starts with me.

30:37.536 --> 30:38.737
Thanks, guys.
(machine clicks)

30:38.770 --> 30:41.340
Our ship has a
dedicated captain.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.242
Well, we've done
something at least.

30:43.275 --> 30:45.711
I mean, if not for this year,
then maybe next year

30:45.744 --> 30:48.147
he'll get CalSci
over the hump.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.982
Oh, by the way,
Charlie tells me

30:50.016 --> 30:51.417
that you
and the DARPA lady--

30:51.450 --> 30:55.854
um, Jane Karellen-- had more
than a working relationship?

30:55.888 --> 30:58.124
She was amazing--

30:58.157 --> 31:01.160
beautiful, strong,
quick-witted--

31:01.193 --> 31:03.795
but my, she did come
with a dark side.

31:03.829 --> 31:07.133
Yeah, isn't that what makes them
so interesting?

31:07.166 --> 31:09.701
The intoxication of lust
made it so easy

31:09.735 --> 31:12.238
to betray my own principles.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.306
Are you sure
you had them yet?

31:14.340 --> 31:16.242
I remember

31:16.275 --> 31:20.379
at that age,
my beliefs were kind of fluid.

31:20.412 --> 31:25.051
Maybe she just forced
you to decide

31:25.084 --> 31:26.618
where you were going
to draw the line.

31:27.753 --> 31:30.789
Yes, perhaps she was

31:30.822 --> 31:34.393
the anti-Buddha.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.565
DON:
Hey.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.901
Hey.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.136
What's all this?

31:44.170 --> 31:45.437
It's a memory dump.

31:45.471 --> 31:46.472
It's like a CAT scan.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.241
I'm trying to figure out
what makes Baley tick.

31:51.243 --> 31:56.082
So what do you think
about that DoD offer?

31:56.115 --> 31:58.917
Oh, five years
of unobstructed research,

31:58.951 --> 32:01.287
unlimited funds?

32:02.254 --> 32:04.090
- What do you think?
- Look,

32:04.123 --> 32:05.191
I'm sure it's a good offer.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.858
- But...?
- Well, it's interesting

32:06.892 --> 32:08.727
how much Larry doesn't like her.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.230
You don't like her.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.931
I think you can do better.

32:12.965 --> 32:15.267
For instance?

32:15.301 --> 32:17.970
Today's FBI.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.575
There's no other way

32:23.609 --> 32:25.511
to access Baley from
outside of Steel Cave?

32:25.544 --> 32:26.412
No.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.147
What about this cable
right here?

32:28.180 --> 32:31.150
Jessie Robertson says that it
runs through a DoD substation.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.919
The only person with access
to that substation is me.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.288
There's a Joe Baskin
to see her.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.730
You can't lock me
out of my own company.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.898
DARPA is
taking control.

32:46.932 --> 32:48.800
There's too much
going on at Steel Cave,

32:48.834 --> 32:51.537
so your services are
no longer necessary.

32:51.570 --> 32:52.704
It's my company.

32:52.738 --> 32:53.839
I've got
the financials, Joseph.

32:53.872 --> 32:54.840
There is nothing

32:54.873 --> 32:56.008
left of your company,

32:56.042 --> 32:57.176
but the Baley Project,

32:57.209 --> 32:59.445
and she belongs to us.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.480
Dr. Baskin?

33:01.513 --> 33:03.415
You wouldn't do this
if Daniel was still alive.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.151
Convenient.

33:05.184 --> 33:09.621
My project manager is murdered,
and you just take over.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.092
(sighs)

33:13.125 --> 33:15.761
You have been paid
very well, Dr. Baskin.

33:15.794 --> 33:18.730
I suggest you enjoy
your retirement.

33:23.035 --> 33:25.604
Hi, guys.

33:25.637 --> 33:28.307
Baley's a fraud.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.008
I thought she passed that test?

33:30.042 --> 33:31.910
It did,
but that's all it can do.

33:31.943 --> 33:33.179
CHARLIE:
Yeah, Robertson was following

33:33.212 --> 33:35.181
a completely different
AI path at home.

33:35.214 --> 33:38.717
Made us think that something
with Baley wasn't totally right.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.152
So we studied
her code...

33:40.186 --> 33:42.088
No, we studied its code

33:42.121 --> 33:43.855
to understand how
Baley was thinking.

33:43.889 --> 33:44.923
Yeah, and we found that

33:44.956 --> 33:47.126
it was programmed
with an advanced version

33:47.159 --> 33:49.495
of an expert systems
recursive search.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.330
Kind of like,
Cyrano de Bergerac,

33:51.363 --> 33:55.667
whispering the right words into
Christian's ear to woo Roxanne.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.270
Now, imagine 4,000 Cyranos

33:58.304 --> 34:01.640
processing 300 million
conversations per second,

34:01.673 --> 34:03.309
combining their expertise

34:03.342 --> 34:06.945
to form the very best response
at any given moment.

34:06.978 --> 34:08.114
That's Baley.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.781
Programmed to do
one thing:

34:09.815 --> 34:11.183
pass the Turing test.

34:11.217 --> 34:12.518
Remember when that
chess champion,

34:12.551 --> 34:15.254
Gary Kasparov, lost to that
computer named Deep Blue?

34:15.287 --> 34:17.556
Yeah, the computer won by
doing something no human could:

34:17.589 --> 34:20.759
by processing 200 million
chess positions per second.

34:20.792 --> 34:22.428
Baley can process

34:22.461 --> 34:26.031
over a billion words, sentences
and conversations in a second,

34:26.064 --> 34:27.133
and come up
with the most

34:27.166 --> 34:28.534
natural human response

34:28.567 --> 34:29.735
every single time.

34:29.768 --> 34:31.237
Wow.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.605
So, really what
she is, is the best

34:33.639 --> 34:35.040
all-time quote machine,

34:35.073 --> 34:36.908
built to fool
visiting dignitaries.

34:36.942 --> 34:37.876
Well, she fooled me.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.745
Fooled me, too.

34:39.778 --> 34:40.812
Fooled us all.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.348
That was
her purpose.

34:44.850 --> 34:47.419
Baley's not real?

34:51.190 --> 34:53.925
Of course not.

34:53.959 --> 34:56.027
So, you didn't know?

34:56.061 --> 34:58.830
We have a huge
failure rate.

34:58.864 --> 35:00.466
I guess I...

35:00.499 --> 35:02.934
I guess I was just
hoping too hard

35:02.968 --> 35:05.471
that this would
be the one.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.773
It's time we take a look
at those books.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.175
Okay.

35:14.746 --> 35:16.748
(computer trilling)

35:19.017 --> 35:21.687
Those are Robertson's
purchase orders.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.755
(computer trilling)

35:23.789 --> 35:24.856
(typing)

35:24.890 --> 35:26.625
(beeps and trills)

35:26.658 --> 35:29.528
$65,000 in electronics

35:29.561 --> 35:31.797
equipment shipped
to Claire

35:31.830 --> 35:33.865
Wells's apartment?

35:33.899 --> 35:34.933
What's that about?

35:34.966 --> 35:36.101
They all skim.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.403
It's built into the budget.

35:37.436 --> 35:38.970
Well, Robertson
or Baskin, sure,

35:39.004 --> 35:40.972
but why pay off
the mechanic?

35:41.006 --> 35:42.140
(beeps twice)

35:42.174 --> 35:44.510
COLBY: Maybe she figured out
Baley was a fraud,

35:44.543 --> 35:46.278
and Robertson bribed her
to shut up.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.851
Open door.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.886
Never a good sign.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.188
Miss Wells?

35:58.257 --> 36:00.826
Miss Wells?

36:06.598 --> 36:07.966
What are the odds

36:07.999 --> 36:10.202
that that's ketchup?

36:14.906 --> 36:17.175
(panting)

36:17.209 --> 36:18.510
(sighs)
Oh.

36:18.544 --> 36:20.779
Don't think we can pin
this one on the computer.

36:29.988 --> 36:31.156
So, what about
Wells's apartment?

36:31.189 --> 36:32.424
No prints.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.526
It was pretty clean
for all that blood.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.928
ME said the defensive
wounds on the hands,

36:36.962 --> 36:38.196
compounded with
multiple strikes,

36:38.230 --> 36:40.065
look to be more passionate.

36:40.098 --> 36:41.433
Yeah, someone really
didn't like Wells.

36:41.467 --> 36:42.968
Same guy who
killed Robertson

36:43.001 --> 36:44.135
and wiped
Baley's memory?

36:44.169 --> 36:45.170
Hired Gibbons.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.438
GIBBONS:
I told you,

36:46.472 --> 36:47.806
I don't know
any Claire Wells.

36:47.839 --> 36:50.242
I was in Houston when
that other dude got killed.

36:50.276 --> 36:51.277
I know, Andy.

36:51.310 --> 36:52.578
You're clear for both murders.

36:52.611 --> 36:55.113
LAWYER: Then why are you holding
my client?

36:55.146 --> 36:56.415
DAVID:
Because the guy who hired him,

36:56.448 --> 36:57.716
the guy he's protecting--
we think

36:57.749 --> 37:01.186
that he killed Claire Wells
and Daniel Robertson.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.189
And he's probably
the same guy

37:04.222 --> 37:07.192
who is paying
for your billing hours.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.226
Hold on.

37:08.260 --> 37:10.296
Andy here has a choice.

37:10.329 --> 37:12.498
He can come in for protection,

37:12.531 --> 37:15.367
or he can hope
that you don't take him

37:15.401 --> 37:17.235
for the kind of ride
that he does not

37:17.269 --> 37:18.236
come back from.

37:18.270 --> 37:19.204
Ho-Hold on.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.939
It's Baskin.

37:22.107 --> 37:23.609
CEO of Steel Cave?

37:23.642 --> 37:24.843
Yeah, man.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.845
Yeah.

37:26.878 --> 37:29.281
Um, can I have a new lawyer?

37:33.419 --> 37:36.355
(engines roaring)

37:38.790 --> 37:42.494
(siren blaring)

37:44.363 --> 37:46.398
Where the hell does Baskin
think he's going?

37:46.432 --> 37:48.434
Well, if you catch him,
we can ask him.

37:48.467 --> 37:51.403
(tires squealing)

37:56.908 --> 37:59.044
(siren blaring)

38:05.717 --> 38:08.186
(tires squealing)

38:08.219 --> 38:09.254
(plane tires squeak)

38:09.287 --> 38:10.556
(car tires squeal)

38:13.825 --> 38:14.826
DON:
Let's go!

38:14.860 --> 38:16.995
FBI. Open that door now!

38:17.028 --> 38:18.997
Don't make us
come in there!

38:19.030 --> 38:20.198
Easy. Easy.

38:20.231 --> 38:21.166
COLBY:
Come on out, ma'am.

38:21.199 --> 38:22.701
Baskin, let's go!

38:22.734 --> 38:24.269
I want to see those hands,
Baskin!

38:24.302 --> 38:25.971
Out in front of you!

38:26.004 --> 38:27.473
Nice and easy.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.174
RADIO DISPATCH:
Stand by, all units, stand by.

38:29.207 --> 38:31.209
Get them behind your back!

38:31.242 --> 38:34.480
BASKIN:
Yes, I hired Gibbons to wipe

38:34.513 --> 38:36.114
the supercomputer's memory.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.983
I did not kill
Daniel Robertson.

38:38.016 --> 38:39.818
I did not kill
Claire Wells.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.920
COLBY: So, you and Robertson
stole DARPA's money,

38:41.953 --> 38:44.289
and you wanted to keep it
all for yourself.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.557
BASKIN:
How?

38:45.591 --> 38:47.959
Daniel was the only guy
that could keep Baley going.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.928
As soon as he died,
I knew it would come out.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.096
That's why I hired Gibbons.

38:51.129 --> 38:52.864
Well, even
if Robertson didn't die,

38:52.898 --> 38:54.666
the fraud would have come out
sooner or later.

38:54.700 --> 38:58.336
We could keep Baley going
for six months or so,

38:58.370 --> 38:59.971
then crash the whole system.

39:00.005 --> 39:03.875
DARPA's got a failure rate
of about 95%.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.477
Nobody would have asked
any questions.

39:05.511 --> 39:07.446
(sighs)
And what about Wells?

39:07.479 --> 39:09.147
Why did you pay her off?

39:09.180 --> 39:10.382
I didn't pay her off.

39:10.416 --> 39:12.083
As far as I knew,

39:12.117 --> 39:13.752
she never knew about Baley
one way or the other.

39:13.785 --> 39:15.120
So, what's this?

39:15.153 --> 39:18.590
$65,000 in electronics?

39:20.025 --> 39:21.159
(laughs)

39:21.192 --> 39:22.528
There were rumors
about those two,

39:22.561 --> 39:23.895
but I never saw it.

39:25.831 --> 39:28.967
That's not a payoff,
Agent Granger.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.602
Gifts, maybe.

39:32.738 --> 39:33.539
(David sighs)

39:33.572 --> 39:36.442
You don't give gifts like that
to an assistant.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.376
You give them to a lover.

39:38.410 --> 39:39.344
We know whoever killed Robertson

39:39.377 --> 39:40.679
could definitely hack
into that computer.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.347
Robertson's wife told Charlie

39:42.380 --> 39:45.350
exactly how to get into Baley.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.686
She would have the passion
to chop up his lover.

39:47.719 --> 39:50.789
What, all this comes down
to just jealousy?

39:55.627 --> 39:58.363
You know
how much money he stole?

39:58.396 --> 40:00.298
Millions.

40:00.331 --> 40:01.867
And he spent it on her.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.168
Did you even see her?

40:03.201 --> 40:05.136
Saw her after
you stabbed her.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.438
Ah, no jury's gonna convict me

40:06.472 --> 40:08.707
when they find out
he was cheating on me,

40:08.740 --> 40:10.542
and stealing
from the government,

40:10.576 --> 40:13.211
messing around with that bitch.

40:13.244 --> 40:16.114
Wow. You haven't been around
many courtrooms, have you?

40:18.383 --> 40:19.551
Oh, Lawrence.

40:19.585 --> 40:21.620
I didn't expect
to find you here.

40:21.653 --> 40:23.489
Charlie's not here.

40:23.522 --> 40:24.490
Well, I can come back later.

40:24.523 --> 40:25.491
LARRY:
Actually, no.

40:25.524 --> 40:26.825
You can't.

40:31.863 --> 40:34.533
I see.

40:34.566 --> 40:35.567
LARRY:
Charlie sends his regrets.

40:35.601 --> 40:37.636
He will be declining your offer
at this time.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.505
DON: And I wouldn't really
expect

40:39.538 --> 40:41.172
any time in the future, either.

40:41.206 --> 40:41.540
JANE:
A mind like that,

40:41.573 --> 40:43.341
and my resources--
there's nowhere else

40:43.374 --> 40:44.810
he can reach his full potential.

40:44.843 --> 40:48.413
You know, I realize you don't
hear the word "no" very often,

40:48.446 --> 40:49.481
but you will have

40:49.515 --> 40:51.750
to go through me
to get to Charlie.

40:52.618 --> 40:55.120
And I suppose you, too?

40:56.287 --> 40:58.456
(scoffs)

41:01.226 --> 41:05.363
You know, before the planned
invasion of Japan in 1945,

41:05.396 --> 41:08.133
we expected to lose
upwards of four million

41:08.166 --> 41:09.568
American soldiers,

41:09.601 --> 41:11.436
not to mention
the ten million civilian

41:11.469 --> 41:13.872
casualties predicted.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.073
I wonder,

41:15.106 --> 41:17.676
if Oppenheimer had an older
brother, instead of younger,

41:17.709 --> 41:19.010
if we would have had

41:19.044 --> 41:20.478
15 million more graves

41:20.512 --> 41:22.113
in southern Japan today.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.449
LARRY:
And I wonder

41:24.482 --> 41:26.284
if you would have sat next

41:26.317 --> 41:28.787
to Senator McCarthy
back in 1953,

41:28.820 --> 41:32.791
stripping Oppenheimer
of his security clearance,

41:32.824 --> 41:36.528
slandering him as disloyal
to those same American troops

41:36.562 --> 41:39.197
he saved eight years earlier.

41:50.375 --> 41:52.811
Nice.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.445
ALAN: All right, move it around.
Come on.

41:54.479 --> 41:55.513
Keep it going, guys.
Keep it going.

41:55.547 --> 41:57.549
Make it fast! Faster!

41:57.583 --> 41:59.517
Take a shot.
You see, it works.

41:59.551 --> 42:01.152
Way to go, Aron.

42:01.186 --> 42:02.087
Nice shot.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.221
Hey, Coach.

42:03.254 --> 42:04.823
Not anymore.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.592
Pardon me?

42:06.625 --> 42:08.526
Didn't you get my message?

42:08.560 --> 42:10.796
Yeah, you said
you were on board, and-and...

42:10.829 --> 42:12.798
No, no, no. I said
you were absolutely right.

42:12.831 --> 42:13.965
Winning is very important.

42:13.999 --> 42:15.500
I've been losing here
for nine years.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.435
It's time for me
to go some place

42:17.468 --> 42:18.604
that's got a shot.

42:18.637 --> 42:19.605
Thanks again.

42:19.638 --> 42:21.272
Oh, where-where
you going?

42:21.306 --> 42:24.576
Who's coaching?

42:24.610 --> 42:26.612
You are, Coach Eppes.

42:26.645 --> 42:27.913
Congratulations.

42:27.946 --> 42:29.314
See ya.

42:35.486 --> 42:37.623
I thought
this was it.

42:37.656 --> 42:40.025
The moment the world
changed forever.

42:40.058 --> 42:42.628
Singularity.

42:42.661 --> 42:44.730
And we were right
at the center of it.

42:44.763 --> 42:46.564
You know, I sit
at a computer

42:46.598 --> 42:48.600
for 12 hours a day.

42:48.634 --> 42:51.102
And then to think that someone

42:51.136 --> 42:53.571
finally came up
with the miraculous combination

42:53.605 --> 42:55.674
of coding and programming

42:55.707 --> 42:58.944
to create life
within that very circuitry.

42:58.977 --> 43:00.578
Amita.

43:00.612 --> 43:03.514
I know, Charlie.

43:03.548 --> 43:05.483
It's okay.

43:05.516 --> 43:07.018
We can just watch.
