It's you.

00:03.360 --> 00:04.919
Hi.

00:05.960 --> 00:08.239
Have you got a problem with me
seeing your brother?

00:08.240 --> 00:09.461
Liv, whatever he's told you,
don't believe him.

00:09.462 --> 00:11.061
He's a psycho. Stay away from her.

00:12.200 --> 00:12.999
Why do you care?

00:13.000 --> 00:14.039
They're brothers.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.999
If you cared then why did
you fuck my best friend?!

00:17.000 --> 00:18.159
Mins!

00:18.160 --> 00:19.359
Are we still friends?

00:19.360 --> 00:23.359
I was hoping more than that.

00:24.840 --> 00:28.839
I don't care if they're one-legged
deadhermaphrodites. I need some sex.

I was... I was putting it
in a cup first.

01:42.760 --> 01:46.759
So it's fine, cos it was, like...

01:46.800 --> 01:49.599
cup first, and then swoosh.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.599
Straight down the plughole.

It's your birthday present, Alo.

It's a spade.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.239
Oh.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.759
I've been talking to your father.

05:04.760 --> 05:05.919
You're not going to town tonight.

05:05.920 --> 05:06.999
What?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.279
Da's milking on a rolling shift.
He needs you.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.079
I can't.Me and Rich are doing
stuff.

05:11.080 --> 05:13.759
I don't give a monkey's, Alo.
Your father needs help.

05:13.760 --> 05:17.239
Every single day
he's out there on his own.

05:17.240 --> 05:18.599
Anything could happen to him.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.159
He's got Dewi.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.159
Ma', it's my birthday!

05:22.160 --> 05:24.559
There are bigger problems
in this world

05:24.560 --> 05:27.279
than you and your poxy
little friends, my lad.

05:27.280 --> 05:27.879
But Ma!

05:27.880 --> 05:30.079
You need to try harder, Alo.

05:30.080 --> 05:34.079
You are not being fair.

Cheers for me spade, Mum.

Oh!

05:56.200 --> 05:58.879
Happy birthday, son.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.319
Oh.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.199
Wow.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.759
Thanks, Dad.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.199
She's a good runner.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.119
You've a lot to catch up on,
so you can't go out for too long.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.239
Actually, Da', there's...

06:19.800 --> 06:22.559
So, Dad, me and Rich
were thinking of sort of...

06:22.560 --> 06:25.599
It's my birthday and everything,
so we were thinking of...

06:25.600 --> 06:29.599
Concentrate. Nice and easy,
just like I taught you.

06:29.840 --> 06:32.119
Right. Yeah.

06:32.120 --> 06:36.119
Nice one.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.639
Nice and gently,
couple of fingers worth.

06:40.640 --> 06:44.639
Not too much choke.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.399
He's a good lad, Dew.

I swear, if you've been
ultra-wanking...

07:34.120 --> 07:35.199
Problem.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.599
'Oh, here we fucking go.'

07:36.600 --> 07:40.239
I think I'm gonna be late to the pub.

07:40.240 --> 07:43.239
Rich, how hot should tractors get?

07:43.240 --> 07:45.399
I'm not at the pub, Alo.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.999
I'm... at your surprise party.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.039
'What?'

07:49.040 --> 07:51.399
Yeah. Happy birthday...
you ungrateful cunt.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.319
LIV: 'Happy birthday, Alo!'

07:53.320 --> 07:56.839
Oh, shit! Mate, I can't get away.
Mumgabe's doing her nut.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.559
Tell him he's scheduled
to entertain the young debutante.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.159
Liv's got you a practice girl.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.039
What?

08:03.040 --> 08:05.439
Like, a real one?
Does she look good?

08:05.440 --> 08:08.879
Um...

08:08.880 --> 08:11.559
No. I think it's retinal.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.319
What? Look, listen, mate,

08:13.320 --> 08:16.279
if there was ever a rock-solid,
iron-clad, balls-in chance

08:16.280 --> 08:19.199
of you getting laid,
then this is definitely it.
All right?

08:19.200 --> 08:21.079
LIV: 'Tell him you've done
the vol-au-vents.'

08:21.080 --> 08:23.279
RICHY: 'Yeah, I've done
fucking vol-au-vents.'

08:23.280 --> 08:27.279
So finish up
and get your shit together.

Oh, come on!

08:47.360 --> 08:49.479
What happened here? Get out.

08:49.480 --> 08:53.479
I dunno, it just sort of...
it just sort of went.

08:54.440 --> 08:57.399
Dad, there's this, er...
there's this party...

08:57.400 --> 08:58.599
He overheated it.

08:58.600 --> 09:02.279
So I should probably, er...
I should probably be heading off,
then.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.799
Alo, we need to sort this.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.839
Dad, it's my birthday. Rich is...

09:05.840 --> 09:07.359
Fine.

09:07.360 --> 09:10.079
Just go, then, Bey.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.639
But you need to...

09:11.640 --> 09:15.319
Nice one, Da'!

09:15.320 --> 09:19.319
I think he's fucked it.

Shit my balls!

09:49.160 --> 09:50.239
Has a war started?

09:50.240 --> 09:52.119
Where did you go last night, Alo?

09:52.120 --> 09:54.879
Nowhere.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.439
All right, town.
But I had to, Rich did vol-au-vents.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.479
I don't care what drugs
your friends were taking.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.559
But Dad said...

10:01.560 --> 10:03.839
Your father should have asked me.

10:03.840 --> 10:07.839
These arrived for you in the post
this morning. Your projected grades.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.959
There's an application form
for Nando's stapled to them.

10:11.960 --> 10:15.959
No, there isn't.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.759
Oh, this is just victimisation!

10:18.760 --> 10:22.319
We've decided you're
leaving college.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.039
Today.

10:25.040 --> 10:25.559
What?

10:25.560 --> 10:28.919
We tried to be reasonable with you,
Alo,

10:28.920 --> 10:30.879
but last night was the final straw.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.199
We tried to give you a choice,

10:32.200 --> 10:34.559
but you have let yourself down
again, haven't you?

10:34.560 --> 10:37.919
From now on, you're gonna work here
with your father

10:37.920 --> 10:41.199
so we can keep an eye on you.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.679
You're joking?

10:42.680 --> 10:45.759
I'm not leaving college, Mum.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.839
We're meeting Mr Blood at ten.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.519
Put your suit on.

10:49.520 --> 10:53.519
Mum, I'm not leaving college.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.239
Check out the shit heap.

11:00.240 --> 11:04.239
Nice car!

11:09.040 --> 11:10.639
Mum!

11:10.640 --> 11:14.639
Stay in the car with the dog, Dewi.

11:15.360 --> 11:19.359
Not today, thank you, Richard.

11:26.400 --> 11:30.399
So, here on the form,
where it says "reason for leaving",

11:31.720 --> 11:34.519
I'll just put "simpleton", OK?

11:34.520 --> 11:36.359
He's just a bit...

11:36.360 --> 11:40.079
Useless?

11:40.080 --> 11:43.319
Well, it's very refreshing to see
parents taking an honest appraisal

11:43.320 --> 11:44.839
of their child's limitations.

11:44.840 --> 11:46.879
We just don't know
what else to do with him.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.599
Of course you don't.
And why should you?

11:49.600 --> 11:53.599
Now, I am required to suggest
that Alo picks up

11:53.760 --> 11:56.719
some kind of vocational outlet.

11:56.720 --> 12:00.039
The world needs ditch diggers too,
and all that.

12:00.040 --> 12:04.039
Well, he'll be working
with his father, on the farm.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.799
How, er... agricultural.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.999
Just in case, an old
college chum of mine

12:11.000 --> 12:13.719
runs a medical testing facility.

12:13.720 --> 12:17.719
They're giving away free Xboxes
to new admissions.

12:18.760 --> 12:22.759
Old Xbox or Xbox 360?

12:58.440 --> 13:00.199
Blatantly on a piece of string.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.759
All right, fun police.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.439
What the fuck's going on?

13:03.440 --> 13:05.239
My mum's in there, ruining my life.

13:05.240 --> 13:08.519
We know. That's why we're
doing a kidnap on you.

13:08.520 --> 13:12.519
Oh. Nice one. Where are we going?

13:12.640 --> 13:13.999
Rich?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.839
Um... We've only planned this far.

13:16.840 --> 13:19.639
So...

13:19.640 --> 13:20.919
Pub?

13:20.920 --> 13:24.919
ALL: Pub.

13:24.920 --> 13:28.279
BURLESQUE MUSIC

13:28.280 --> 13:30.199
Nice one!

13:30.200 --> 13:32.319
So you're just going to roll over?

13:32.320 --> 13:33.839
Well, what else can I do?

13:33.840 --> 13:37.439
Go Viking on that shit.
Burn the fucker down.

13:37.440 --> 13:40.239
No... Couldn't do it to the old boy.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.999
So where do you draw the line?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.799
You're a person, Alo, not a cow.

13:43.800 --> 13:46.359
It's your life, so you get
to choose. That's the deal.

13:46.360 --> 13:50.359
I know they're being shitty,
but I can't just wreck the farm.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.239
It's all they've got, and I...

13:53.240 --> 13:55.439
You know...

13:55.440 --> 13:57.279
No, what?

13:57.280 --> 13:58.959
I love them and stuff.

13:58.960 --> 14:02.959
Ha-ha. You're gay for your parents.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.119
MEN CHEERING

14:07.120 --> 14:11.119
Grace! Come on.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.999
And what exactly are we doing
in this shit hole?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.199
They've done a kidnap on me.

14:16.200 --> 14:19.039
Alo fancies his parents, even though
they're making him drop out

14:19.040 --> 14:20.599
for free slave labour on the farm.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.399
You've got to do something, mate.
Cos it won't stop.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.319
They'll just keep grinding you down

14:25.320 --> 14:27.719
till you're miserable
and soulless and old,

14:27.720 --> 14:28.239
just like them.

14:28.240 --> 14:32.239
You've got to stick it
to the man, bruv.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.999
Bollocks.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.719
Aloysius Schmeichel Creevey!

14:37.720 --> 14:41.719
Fucking sell-out, Rags!

14:57.920 --> 15:01.399
It's no good you sulking, Alo.
You've officially left college now.

15:01.400 --> 15:05.399
Yes, Mum.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.519
I've planned out your day for you.

15:09.520 --> 15:12.039
You should have this lot finished
by bath time.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.319
Yes, Mum.

15:13.320 --> 15:16.799
I'm only thinking of you, Alo.
You may not like it,

15:16.800 --> 15:17.679
but you've had your chances.

15:17.680 --> 15:18.719
Yes, Mum.
