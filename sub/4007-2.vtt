00:10.560 --> 00:11.914
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:12.120 --> 00:13.634
How is Deb? She's better?

00:13.840 --> 00:14.876
Yeah, she's great.

00:15.080 --> 00:18.278
What case is she working on?
Briggs. Andrew Briggs.

00:18.480 --> 00:19.516
Deb, what's going on?

00:19.720 --> 00:22.360
I'm getting close to Briggs
so I can get the jewellery

00:22.560 --> 00:23.710
before he fences it.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.759
You haven't talked to me in weeks.
You made me compromise

00:27.000 --> 00:29.515
everything about myself
that I care about.

00:29.720 --> 00:31.757
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.799
Don't stop. Don't stop.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.356
The chance that someone
might find out our secret

00:37.560 --> 00:38.960
makes it even more fun.

00:39.160 --> 00:43.040
You're all sweaty.
Yup. Just doing a little cardio.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.839
Whoa.
Looks like a piece of it

00:46.000 --> 00:49.198
has been scooped out.
That's the anterior insular cortex,

00:49.440 --> 00:52.558
the portion of the brain
that processes empathy.

00:52.760 --> 00:55.878
This is Dr. Evelyn Vogel.
Evelyn is a neuropsychiatrist.

00:56.080 --> 00:59.551
I hear the FBI calls her
the psychopath whisperer.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.910
What was he like?
Who?

01:01.160 --> 01:02.389
The Bay Harbor Butcher.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.398
I look forward to working with you,
Dexter Morgan.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.350
Can you look into someone
named El Sapo for me?

01:09.560 --> 01:11.313
<i>- Who is he?</i>
- He's a fucking fence.

01:11.520 --> 01:13.239
El Sapo isn't a fence.
He's a hit man.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.352
He's gonna get the jewels
and kill Briggs.

01:15.560 --> 01:17.756
I'm trying to keep you from
getting shot along with him.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.116
Aah!
I came here to save you.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.835
Deb, look at yourself. You're lost.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.874
You are lost.

01:26.360 --> 01:29.478
Dexter. I was hoping
to share something with you.

01:35.520 --> 01:36.670
What is it you want?

01:36.880 --> 01:38.712
You can't kill me.

01:39.960 --> 01:41.553
Why?

01:41.960 --> 01:44.998
Because I don't fit Harry's code.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.118
<i>We're recording.</i>

03:48.520 --> 03:50.398
<i>So to review where we are,</i>

03:50.600 --> 03:53.320
<i>two weeks ago, you told me
that your son Dexter</i>

03:53.520 --> 03:56.911
<i>had asked to see the actual scene
of a homicide.</i>

03:57.120 --> 03:59.112
<i>You also said that you opposed
this request.</i>

03:59.320 --> 04:01.630
<i>Yes. Because he's only 10 years old.</i>

04:01.880 --> 04:03.917
<i>So why are you here today?</i>

04:04.120 --> 04:06.351
<i>He kept asking and asking</i>

04:06.600 --> 04:09.035
<i>so I decided to give him
what he wanted.</i>

04:09.240 --> 04:12.756
<i>I even started to hope it might
shock him out of this...</i>

04:14.040 --> 04:15.759
<i>condition.</i>

04:16.000 --> 04:17.992
<i>Tell me what happened.</i>

04:18.880 --> 04:20.951
<i>I got a call about a homicide
in Coral Gables.</i>

04:21.160 --> 04:25.632
<i>A woman had shot her ex-husband as
he was trying to break into the house.</i>

04:25.840 --> 04:27.991
<i>I waited until the forensic guys
cleared out</i>

04:28.240 --> 04:30.630
<i>and then I snuck Dexter
onto the scene.</i>

04:32.360 --> 04:35.000
<i>The victim had fallen
through a sliding glass door</i>

04:35.200 --> 04:36.714
<i>so there was blood everywhere.</i>

04:36.960 --> 04:38.519
<i>And it didn't seem to faze Dexter.</i>

04:38.680 --> 04:40.160
<i>And he wasn't bothered at all?</i>

04:40.360 --> 04:42.829
<i>If anything, he was fascinated.</i>

04:45.120 --> 04:48.033
<i>He just stood there, staring.</i>

04:52.080 --> 04:54.037
<i>Like he was admiring a painting.</i>

04:54.240 --> 04:57.438
<i>I remember that day.
It was like a painting.</i>

04:57.640 --> 04:59.359
<i>And I wanted to be the artist.</i>

04:59.560 --> 05:03.713
<i>We didn't stay long, and when we were
driving home, I noticed that...</i>

05:04.600 --> 05:07.513
<i>Dexter was holding something
in his hand.</i>

05:09.280 --> 05:11.636
<i>He'd stolen it from the crime scene.</i>

05:12.360 --> 05:14.079
<i>A trophy.</i>

05:18.760 --> 05:21.229
<i>I'm right about Dex, aren't I?</i>

05:23.240 --> 05:25.232
<i>There's something wrong with him.</i>

05:25.480 --> 05:28.234
<i>One could put it that way,
but I do agree</i>

05:28.440 --> 05:31.114
<i>that Dexter is exactly
what you suspect him to be.</i>

05:31.720 --> 05:35.919
<i>Trust me when I say that there's
a place in this world for your son.</i>

05:36.120 --> 05:38.794
<i>I don't know what it is
or what form it will take</i>

05:39.000 --> 05:41.640
<i>but we're gonna find it together.</i>

05:43.320 --> 05:47.758
You were only 10 years old
when your father first sought my help.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.800
I know almost everything
about you, Dexter.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.429
Not just because I heard it
from your father

05:55.640 --> 05:57.950
but because I helped create you.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.710
Create me?
You sound like Dr. Frankenstein.

06:01.960 --> 06:05.112
Don't mean to.
Don't know how else to put it.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.710
I mean, it was obvious
that you not only showed

06:07.920 --> 06:10.992
all the classic traits
of a psychopath

06:11.200 --> 06:14.352
but that you would eventually
become a killer.

06:15.240 --> 06:19.154
So we were faced with a little dilemma:
what to do with you.

06:20.040 --> 06:24.034
It was me who convinced Harry
that your urges couldn't be stopped

06:24.240 --> 06:26.471
but they could be focused.

06:27.920 --> 06:32.437
Eventually we realised that hunting
animals wasn't going to satiate you

06:32.640 --> 06:38.352
so we decided that you could be
taught to kill other kinds of animals.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.950
People who truly deserve to die.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.755
You're saying you came up
with the code?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.878
Harry had a big hand in the details.

06:46.400 --> 06:49.552
His law enforcement background
was certainly an asset

06:49.800 --> 06:52.634
but he was operating
under my guidance.

06:55.560 --> 07:02.478
I can't help but think of myself
as your spiritual mother.

07:02.960 --> 07:06.158
I know we've only just met
face to face

07:06.400 --> 07:09.040
but this is kind of like a reunion.
Heh.

07:09.280 --> 07:11.476
I should have chilled
some champagne.

07:12.080 --> 07:15.118
You experimented on me.
That's what mothers do?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.799
I developed a framework
for your survival.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.679
That's what mothers do.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.916
You made me what I am.
Heh.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.958
You'd have preferred an institution?
Death row?

07:28.160 --> 07:31.437
I could have turned my back on you.
I could have let Harry do the same.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.718
I could have even
notified the authorities.

07:34.920 --> 07:35.990
Why didn't you?

07:39.600 --> 07:43.230
Well, let's just say
you got under my skin.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.193
I came to care for you, Dexter.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.954
I still do.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.031
Why are you telling me this?

07:56.880 --> 07:58.917
I saved your life.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.793
And I'm afraid I need
to call in the favour.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.197
I'm sure you recognise this.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.760
It's a section of the human brain.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.792
Anterior insular cortex.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.789
A murder victim was missing
the same piece of tissue.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.878
And this is it. In the flesh.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.800
I found it on my doorstep
wrapped in butcher paper.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.560
Unfortunately,
there was no return address.

08:28.760 --> 08:32.356
Why would the killer send this to you?
A message.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.831
I've come to believe
that the killer could be

08:35.039 --> 08:37.794
one of my former patients.

08:38.400 --> 08:41.120
This would be the perfect
explanation for this little gift.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.996
You think it's a threat.
Hm. A brain on a doorstep.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.471
Hardly a love letter.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.357
Sooner or later,

08:59.600 --> 09:03.071
someone's going to be holding
a piece of my brain in a jar.

09:06.320 --> 09:10.314
I want you to find him, Dexter.

09:11.360 --> 09:15.798
And I want you to do
what Harry and I taught you to do.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.800
I don't take requests.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.754
You have contacts at the FBI.
You're working with Miami Metro.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.515
Why don't you go to them?
I wish I could.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.791
What's stopping you?

09:29.040 --> 09:31.714
You're not the first psychopath
I've treated.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.077
You taught other people the code?

09:34.280 --> 09:36.431
No. You're special.

09:36.680 --> 09:39.195
But I've used other
unorthodox methods,

09:40.320 --> 09:43.791
some of which might be
considered illegal.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.471
So if the police track down this killer
and it's someone I treated--

09:48.680 --> 09:50.797
Your unorthodox methods
might be exposed

09:51.000 --> 09:52.878
and your career would be ruined.

09:53.080 --> 09:55.072
You might even go to jail.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.834
You see my problem.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.952
I see that it's your problem.

10:09.560 --> 10:12.917
This will help put things
into perspective.

10:16.280 --> 10:20.559
Don't tell me you're gonna pass up
on another piece of your history.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.880
Think about it,
but don't take too long.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.160
Killer's out there, Dexter,

10:32.360 --> 10:36.320
and I don't mind admitting
I'm afraid of what's coming next.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.680
You don't deserve this,
but I don't have a choice.

10:52.920 --> 10:56.197
I have to. I'm sorry.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.876
<i>Dexter killed someone else
last night.</i>

11:01.040 --> 11:02.235
<i>Who?</i>

11:02.720 --> 11:04.279
<i>A drug dealer.</i>

11:05.920 --> 11:09.516
<i>Guy robbed and killed two
of his clients. College kids.</i>

11:09.720 --> 11:11.677
<i>At least Dexter is following
the programme.</i>

11:13.880 --> 11:17.430
<i>He told me something new that he did
to the drug dealer before he killed him.</i>

11:17.640 --> 11:19.359
<i>And that was?</i>

11:19.600 --> 11:21.671
<i>He made him look at photos
of his victims.</i>

11:23.480 --> 11:25.073
<i>Interesting.</i>

11:25.280 --> 11:26.600
<i>Did you ask him why?</i>

11:28.440 --> 11:31.638
<i>He said it was something
he felt he needed to do.</i>

11:36.160 --> 11:37.480
<i>What do you think it means?</i>

11:38.200 --> 11:40.396
<i>Humans are born with
an innate sense of justice.</i>

11:40.600 --> 11:44.435
<i>Maybe Dexter is discovering this.</i>

11:45.440 --> 11:47.432
<i>The important thing is,
after three kills,</i>

11:47.680 --> 11:49.717
<i>he's embracing the process.</i>

11:51.000 --> 11:53.390
<i>It's gonna work out for him, Harry.</i>

11:55.400 --> 11:56.880
<i>I hope so.</i>

12:01.920 --> 12:05.800
She believed in you
at a time when I was in doubt.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.674
Vogel gave me this DVD to make me
feel as if I owe her something.

12:12.240 --> 12:13.390
Don't you?

12:13.960 --> 12:15.758
If she's responsible for creating me,

12:16.000 --> 12:19.152
she's responsible
for what I've done to Deb.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.310
Maybe Vogel can help you.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.553
Help me how?

12:24.880 --> 12:26.280
With Deb.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.200
You must have told Vogel
a lot about Deb.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.278
She was part of your life.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.034
I wish she still was.

12:34.840 --> 12:37.036
Deb said she hated me,

12:37.240 --> 12:40.358
that she should have killed me
inside that shipping container

12:40.560 --> 12:44.759
instead of LaGuerta. Maybe I should
just listen to you, stay away from her.

12:44.960 --> 12:48.670
All I'm saying is that Vogel
might open up some possibilities.

12:49.640 --> 12:53.156
At the very least, she's a window
to your past that you just can't ignore.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.750
I don't trust Vogel. I can't.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.072
All the more reason
to keep her close.

13:05.120 --> 13:08.477
Okay, just so we're on the same page,
you're supposed to locate Briggs

13:08.720 --> 13:11.440
and take him into custody.
It's that simple, right?

13:12.400 --> 13:15.837
I was also supposed to find
the stolen jewellery, right?

13:16.520 --> 13:19.399
Recover the goods,
collect 20 percent?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.838
Am I supposed to believe that's what
you were doing for two weeks?

13:24.040 --> 13:27.477
Just looking for the jewellery?
Yes, Elway.

13:29.120 --> 13:32.477
He wasn't gonna just give it to me.
It wasn't lying around the apartment.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.319
I had to play him.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.791
What is that shit?
It looks like horse piss.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.037
It's electrolyte replenishment
formula.

13:46.240 --> 13:49.074
You look dehydrated.
It impairs your judgement.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.317
Probably fuelling that bad attitude.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.314
So tell me,

13:56.560 --> 14:00.793
where does it say undercover work
in your job description?

14:02.400 --> 14:03.993
I was improvising.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.078
Well, you put one of my assets
at risk.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.913
Namely yourself.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.274
That's my call.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.551
Well, your asset is just fine.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.911
I wish I could say the same thing
about Briggs.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.436
That again?
I told you I don't know what happened.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.791
I came back to our room
and he was dead.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.554
"Our room"?

14:22.760 --> 14:26.390
So you two were intimate?

14:29.160 --> 14:31.311
First of all, who says "intimate"?

14:33.480 --> 14:36.678
And second, what does it even matter?
What was I supposed to do, say:

14:36.880 --> 14:39.111
"Hey, can I have that jewellery
that you stole

14:39.320 --> 14:42.040
because I'd love to get
the finder's fee on that too"?

14:43.280 --> 14:44.396
I was doing my job.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.434
If you were, we wouldn't be here
with nothing to show for it.

14:47.640 --> 14:51.350
We don't have nothing to show for it.
I found these on Briggs.

14:51.560 --> 14:54.280
This looks like a key
to a storage unit.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.472
I bet that's where
he stashed the jewellery.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.717
Why didn't you tell me that
in the beginning?

14:58.960 --> 15:01.316
Because it's more fun
to watch you eat crow.

15:02.160 --> 15:05.198
Take a bite.
We haven't found the jewellery yet.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.312
You could be wrong.
But what if I'm not?

15:07.520 --> 15:11.480
Then we recover 20 percent.
Right. And you'll love me for that.

15:14.960 --> 15:17.429
<i>Another morning, another body.</i>

15:17.680 --> 15:21.151
<i>Miami makes more corpses
than sunburns.</i>

15:21.360 --> 15:23.272
<i>And I'm thankful.</i>

15:23.520 --> 15:25.557
<i>A crime scene might be
the only place left</i>

15:25.760 --> 15:28.480
<i>where I can still control the chaos.</i>

15:30.840 --> 15:31.876
Fuck me.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.595
What does this guy think,
he's a fucking brain surgeon?

15:34.800 --> 15:36.234
The Brain Surgeon.

15:37.840 --> 15:41.720
Anterior insular cortex is missing,
just like the last one.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.077
So we have a serial?

15:44.880 --> 15:46.872
Vogel was right.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.113
Judging from the lack of blood,

15:50.320 --> 15:53.313
I'd say this one was done
post-mortem too.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.431
No entry wounds.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.797
Ah. Petechial haemorrhaging
around the eyes.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.798
Bruising around the throat.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.320
Asphyxiation.

16:08.520 --> 16:11.035
So the last time,
the killer left the murder weapon

16:11.280 --> 16:12.714
somewhere near the body.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.272
Maybe he did it again.

16:15.480 --> 16:20.236
So, what are we looking for?
Ropes, nylons, giant pillow.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.318
Okay, everyone spread out.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.632
<i>A plastic bag?</i>

16:39.280 --> 16:42.478
<i>Not the worst way
to asphyxiate someone.</i>

16:46.800 --> 16:50.316
Blood?
I think I've got a murder weapon.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.113
Let's hope he left a print.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.512
I got another delivery today.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.154
Like the other?

17:13.359 --> 17:15.271
Same section of the brain.

17:15.480 --> 17:18.712
If it is one of my patients
who's doing this, I...

17:19.040 --> 17:21.271
I have to wonder
if I could have prevented it.

17:23.079 --> 17:25.675
You never felt guilty
about what I was doing?

17:26.440 --> 17:27.874
No.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.836
All I ever felt was pride.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.954
Pride?
Mm.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.957
You're not evil, Dexter.

17:37.480 --> 17:40.314
You're actually making
the world a better place.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.634
Not for everyone.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.118
What do you mean by that?

17:51.480 --> 17:53.119
I'm going back to the lab.

17:53.320 --> 17:57.712
We might have a print,
which gives us a head start.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.520
So you're going to help me.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.956
You don't seem surprised.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.555
Like I said,
even though I've just met you,

18:04.760 --> 18:06.717
I know you, Dexter.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.671
Better even than I knew Harry.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.632
Why did he come to you

18:12.840 --> 18:14.718
about me?

18:14.920 --> 18:18.072
I was an expert witness
on a series of homicides

18:18.320 --> 18:20.471
that he was working on,

18:21.520 --> 18:23.000
and we became friends.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.239
It's a long way from being friends

18:26.440 --> 18:28.716
to "I think my son
might be a serial killer."

18:31.760 --> 18:34.275
Harry was aware of my work
on young psychopaths.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.917
And he also knew
that I didn't approach the subject

18:38.120 --> 18:40.999
in terms of black and white,

18:41.640 --> 18:44.155
unlike my colleagues at the time.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.955
And so he just told you everything.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.271
You have to understand
that he had no one else to talk to.

18:53.360 --> 18:56.353
Not Doris.
Certainly no one in the force.

18:56.560 --> 19:02.477
And there never was
any judgement on my part.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.676
Unlike you towards me.

19:06.280 --> 19:08.158
I'm not judging you.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.158
But you don't trust me.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.837
Which you should have expected.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.157
Since you know me so well.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.113
You nervous?

19:30.680 --> 19:32.990
About breaking and entering?
Absolutely.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.237
Prison would put a real crimp
in my business model.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.957
See, we're not breaking.

19:39.160 --> 19:40.913
We're just entering.

20:10.080 --> 20:12.072
You really had sex with this guy?

20:18.080 --> 20:19.639
Shit.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.478
What? What is it?

20:23.320 --> 20:24.720
If...

20:25.200 --> 20:27.431
If I hadn't stayed
to try to get the jewellery,

20:27.640 --> 20:30.553
if I just brought him in,
he'd still be alive.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.479
Don't beat yourself up about it.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.752
After all, it's a criminal
we're talking about, right?

20:37.160 --> 20:39.197
He was actually all right
to hang out with.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.711
He made me forget about
my shitty life for five minutes.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.511
And what exactly is so shitty
about your life?

20:46.760 --> 20:49.070
Other than working for you?
Excuse me.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.795
You left Miami Metro
to come and work for me.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.277
Wise career choice, I might add.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.399
If you accepted more cases,
you may get paid what you're worth.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.592
I left Miami Metro
because I was burned out.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.549
Oh. Right.
Look, I know that's a party line.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.150
Everybody knows Maria LaGuerta
was a pain in the ass.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.073
I understand if you wanted
to dip your toes--

21:09.280 --> 21:11.590
What the fuck
are you even talking about?

21:13.280 --> 21:16.910
LaGuerta was a good cop.
She was a good fucking person.

21:17.760 --> 21:20.719
Well, note to self: Never talk about
anyone Debra Morgan knows.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.110
Understood. Got it.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.993
Why don't you just be really grateful
that I work for you?

21:27.200 --> 21:29.795
Because I'm about to make you
a fuck-ton of money.

21:30.880 --> 21:33.349
It's an unopened bill
from a storage facility.

21:33.600 --> 21:37.514
Why didn't F.L.P.D. find this?
Because it just arrived today.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.552
Found a match for our key.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.035
Okay. Buster's Self Storage.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.072
All right.
Let's go.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.710
I can't. I've got a new client
meeting at the office.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.230
All right, then I'll go alone.
Sh...

21:49.720 --> 21:52.554
Okay. Could you hang on?
Just-- Hey.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.474
Hey.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.193
Hey.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.911
Just do me a favour, all right?

22:04.120 --> 22:05.793
Just be careful.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.671
If I fuck up, you can always ply me
with that electro-shite solution.

22:26.440 --> 22:29.717
I'm running the prints from the plastic
bag through AFIS right now.

22:29.920 --> 22:30.956
Any hits?

22:31.200 --> 22:33.669
Not yet, but if the killer's
on the list you gave me,

22:33.880 --> 22:37.396
there's a good chance he's already
in the system. It shouldn't take long.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.152
Why don't I remember you?

22:42.520 --> 22:47.117
According to you, I was 10
when you started seeing Harry.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.118
I should remember you.

22:49.320 --> 22:52.040
You never met me in person.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.751
Harry forbid it.
Why?

22:54.960 --> 22:57.714
He didn't want you to feel
like you were--

22:57.920 --> 23:00.355
Like you were sick.
He was trying to protect you.

23:00.600 --> 23:04.674
And I respected his wishes,
even after he died.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.960
I could have used someone
to talk to after Harry was gone.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.072
Someone who knew
what I was going through.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.516
You wanted to talk about it?

23:14.440 --> 23:16.750
I was young and I was all alone.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.959
Here it is.

23:22.080 --> 23:25.073
Lyle Sussman?
Sussman?

23:25.280 --> 23:29.240
He wasn't on the list I gave you.
I don't know anyone with that name.

23:29.440 --> 23:31.193
That doesn't mean
he doesn't know you.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.357
You're a published author.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.633
But why would he be targeting me?

23:35.840 --> 23:39.675
Maybe he has an issue with something
you said in one of your books.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.038
Arrested for drunk and disorderly
in 1992.

23:44.240 --> 23:48.200
Single. Has a house on Messina.

23:48.480 --> 23:49.994
Doesn't make sense.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.675
Well, Sussman's print's
on the murder weapon.

23:52.880 --> 23:55.270
Forensics don't lie.

23:56.280 --> 23:57.873
Mm. Look on the bright side.

23:58.120 --> 24:01.796
Maybe this means you did a better job
with your patients than you thought.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.480
Oh. Heh.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.474
Two great minds
at work here. Heh, heh.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.194
Am I interrupting?

24:10.400 --> 24:11.550
No. What's up, Vince?

24:11.760 --> 24:14.275
Well, guess who found
a bloody fingerprint

24:14.480 --> 24:17.120
on the duct tape that was
covering the victim's mouth.

24:18.240 --> 24:19.390
You?

24:19.640 --> 24:21.552
And guess who
it might belong to.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.070
The victim?
Our killer.

24:24.280 --> 24:26.636
It's a partial,
so it could take some time.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.560
How about you?
Anything on the murder weapon?

24:29.760 --> 24:30.876
Partial.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.360
Well, okay. I guess the race is on.

24:38.280 --> 24:39.953
Shit.

24:45.280 --> 24:47.237
Why was it strange

24:47.440 --> 24:50.080
that I needed someone
to talk to when Harry died?

24:50.680 --> 24:54.674
People like you don't usually seek
an emotional connection.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.633
Good luck.

25:14.840 --> 25:16.433
<i>It all looks innocent.</i>

25:16.640 --> 25:18.871
<i>Just like my apartment.</i>

25:23.640 --> 25:25.074
<i>Nah.</i>

25:43.240 --> 25:47.632
<i>Either Sussman lost his green thumb
or he hasn't been here in a while.</i>

25:48.280 --> 25:51.193
<i>Could he be hiding out
at his next kill site?</i>

25:57.800 --> 25:59.154
<i>A hunting cabin?</i>

25:59.360 --> 26:02.831
<i>Isolated. The perfect place for a kill.</i>

26:03.560 --> 26:06.997
<i>Lake Nona. It's a large lake,
but at least it's a starting place.</i>

26:41.000 --> 26:42.719
Well, fuck.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.079
You found my jewellery.

27:20.520 --> 27:22.398
Really made my life easier.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.354
Thank you for that.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.634
What the hell's
your problem?

27:36.080 --> 27:37.560
Bitch. Fucking nuts.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.156
Yeah, I'm fucking nuts.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.235
Stay down.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.359
You're lucky I don't kill people
unless I'm paid to.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.635
Ah. Ow!

28:52.200 --> 28:55.477
I hope Sussman does a better job
keeping in touch with his mother

28:55.680 --> 28:56.796
than I do with mine.

28:57.040 --> 29:00.829
Any reason why you haven't
taken the sergeant's exam?

29:01.360 --> 29:04.432
Uh-- Just haven't
gotten around to it. Why?

29:04.680 --> 29:07.240
Matthews is riding my ass,
keeps pushing people on me.

29:07.440 --> 29:10.194
Sanchez, Whitney.
I'd rather have you.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.395
I didn't know you cared.

29:14.680 --> 29:17.275
You better start taking
your career more seriously, bro.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.080
Especially if you're gonna be
dating my sister.

29:21.920 --> 29:25.118
How'd you know?
Because I'm a good detective.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.199
Why'd you try to hide it from me?

29:27.720 --> 29:31.634
Uh... I thought
your head would explode.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.551
Just get your act together.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.632
If you want me to be okay
with you and Jamie, earn it.

29:38.880 --> 29:41.873
Man up. Take the test.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.600
Do you have any idea where your
son might be, Mrs. Sussman?

29:49.800 --> 29:52.076
It's very important
that we speak with him.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.870
I haven't seen him for days.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.514
Is that normal?

29:56.720 --> 29:58.518
Well, it's not out of the ordinary.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.674
He's probably off hunting
for the weekend.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.753
So he likes to hunt?

30:03.960 --> 30:05.713
Oh, he practically lives for it.

30:06.720 --> 30:12.193
He always brings back
something for the quilt.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.674
Isn't this something?

30:15.240 --> 30:17.152
It sure is.

30:22.400 --> 30:24.596
Where does he go
on these hunting trips?

30:24.840 --> 30:28.356
He has a cabin somewhere
outside the city.

30:28.600 --> 30:29.829
Do you know the address?

30:30.240 --> 30:32.960
No. Sorry. That's all I know.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.879
What did you say this was about?

30:35.080 --> 30:38.118
We just want to ask him a few
questions. That's all, Mrs. Sussman.

30:38.320 --> 30:41.279
I wish I could help you,
but I don't know what else to tell you.

30:41.520 --> 30:44.911
Oh, you need some more. Ha, ha.
Oh.

30:45.120 --> 30:46.679
Excuse me.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.240
Can we go? That fucking quilt
is freaking me out.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.909
It's like a nightmare in fur.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.433
It's Dispatch.

31:04.400 --> 31:05.436
Damn.

31:06.320 --> 31:08.596
<i>Lake Nona will have to wait.</i>

31:08.840 --> 31:11.116
<i>Hopefully not for long.</i>

31:19.680 --> 31:21.194
What's the word, Vince?

31:21.440 --> 31:24.797
Borborygmus. The sound of gas
rumbling through your intestines.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.040
As in, seriously regretting having that
super-green passion fruit smoothie

31:29.240 --> 31:31.471
right about now. Unh.

31:31.920 --> 31:33.274
Gunshot to the head.

31:33.480 --> 31:35.278
I call and raise you
one to the chest.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.915
One in the dash
and one in the headrest.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.640
Either the killer was panicky,

31:39.840 --> 31:42.116
or he really needs some time
at the gun range.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.993
Car's registered
to a Javier Guzman.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.236
You think that's him?

31:45.440 --> 31:47.716
Based on Guzman's rap sheet,
be my guess.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.429
Small-time enforcing, murder.

31:51.040 --> 31:54.192
Went by the street name
of El Sapo.

31:58.640 --> 32:01.474
<i>El Sapo was the hit man
sent to kill Briggs.</i>

32:02.640 --> 32:04.518
<i>If he's been killed...</i>

32:06.560 --> 32:08.711
<i>is Deb in danger?</i>

32:12.520 --> 32:14.352
Dexter Morgan.

32:14.560 --> 32:17.473
Dexter Morgan.
Want to get with the programme?

32:17.680 --> 32:19.160
Dex?

32:19.360 --> 32:21.670
How do you think this went down,
Morgan?

32:22.520 --> 32:24.876
Uh-- Yeah, sorry.

32:25.920 --> 32:28.958
Driver pulls to a stop,
the assailant approaches the car,

32:29.160 --> 32:31.595
most likely gun already drawn.

32:31.840 --> 32:35.038
The vic sees the shooter,
pulls his weapon,

32:35.240 --> 32:37.994
clears the holster,
but it's too late.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.270
The gunman opens fire.

32:40.880 --> 32:42.519
I got a second gun in the glove.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.632
Bag it and tag it.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.400
<i>El Sapo's blood is confined
to the inside of his car.</i>

32:51.600 --> 32:53.193
<i>This can't be his.</i>

32:53.400 --> 32:56.518
<i>The killer might have been reaching
into the car and cut himself.</i>

32:56.720 --> 32:58.313
Dex.

33:02.440 --> 33:05.194
El Sapo. Deb was involved
with these guys.

33:05.400 --> 33:09.599
If someone's taking them out--
I know. I'm on it.

33:09.840 --> 33:13.231
I don't understand, Dexter. You think
you know where Sussman's cabin is

33:13.440 --> 33:16.194
<i>but you're not going after him.</i>
I have to do something.

33:16.400 --> 33:19.199
What's more important
than stopping this killer?

33:19.400 --> 33:21.198
<i>My sister.</i>

33:21.600 --> 33:23.831
Debra's in trouble?
<i>Yes.</i>

33:24.080 --> 33:26.640
Ah. That's what's
been eating at you.

33:26.840 --> 33:30.231
I'm coming up on her house.
I have to hang up.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.833
Jesus, Deb.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.110
What the fuck are you doing here?

34:19.080 --> 34:21.117
Deb.
I don't want you around.

34:21.320 --> 34:24.438
I thought I made that
really fucking clear.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.670
El Sapo is dead.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.070
El Sapo?

34:32.280 --> 34:34.112
The man who was sent
to take out Briggs.

34:34.320 --> 34:36.277
I know who the fuck that is.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.917
Well, someone shot him in his car.
It looked like an execution.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.077
Do you know anything
about this?

34:45.199 --> 34:48.716
All I know is what my head
feels like right now.

34:51.880 --> 34:54.873
I tried calling.
I was worried about you.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.911
That's touching.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.392
I'm fine.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.638
Fine isn't the first word
that comes to mind.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.876
And anybody could have
walked in here.

35:07.400 --> 35:11.314
The door wouldn't close
so I had to get creative.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.360
What happened?

35:18.840 --> 35:20.957
Deb, what happened
to your side?

35:23.640 --> 35:27.316
El Sapo followed me
to the storage unit,

35:28.280 --> 35:31.352
where Briggs kept his stash,
you know.

35:33.280 --> 35:36.079
We tussled, he got the stuff,
end of story.

35:36.320 --> 35:39.438
Except it's not the end of the story.
El Sapo's dead.

35:39.640 --> 35:42.712
It's a better fucking ending.
He deserved it.

35:42.920 --> 35:45.355
And if whoever killed El Sapo
comes after you?

35:45.560 --> 35:47.677
Nobody's coming after me, Dexter.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.075
How do you know that?

35:52.640 --> 35:54.916
Will you not do this, please?

35:56.360 --> 35:57.840
What?

35:59.840 --> 36:01.559
Give a shit.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.835
Deb, I'm your brother.
You can hate me if you want,

36:09.040 --> 36:11.760
but it doesn't change the fact
that I care about you.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.910
I didn't want to hate you.

36:25.800 --> 36:28.190
I wanted the opposite.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.393
But it didn't work out that way.

36:38.440 --> 36:41.877
I can't change the way I feel, so...

36:42.080 --> 36:44.072
Will you go, please?

36:44.280 --> 36:46.078
I'm not leaving you.

36:48.400 --> 36:51.677
Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter,
get the fuck out.

36:54.080 --> 36:55.799
Go.

37:09.720 --> 37:14.476
<i>Deb doesn't want my help,
and Vogel is demanding it.</i>

37:19.920 --> 37:23.038
<i>This is it. Sussman's cabin.</i>

37:26.560 --> 37:29.598
<i>At least I'm staying ahead
of Miami Metro.</i>

37:52.680 --> 37:55.195
<i>Sussman's no stranger
to blood and death.</i>

37:55.400 --> 37:58.313
<i>Vogel is wrong.
Everything points to him as the killer.</i>

38:30.920 --> 38:32.673
<i>Except this.</i>

38:32.880 --> 38:35.634
Maybe Sussman had an accomplice
who decided to take him out.

38:35.840 --> 38:38.639
A killer like Sussman
doesn't use an accomplice.

38:38.840 --> 38:40.877
They're rogues.
He could be the exception.

38:41.080 --> 38:43.470
Yeah, or just the innocent victim
like the first two.

38:43.680 --> 38:46.639
Sussman's prints were on the weapon.
He must have been involved.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.200
Sit down, Dexter.

38:48.800 --> 38:50.473
You're getting agitated.

38:50.920 --> 38:53.435
I'm just trying to figure this out.

38:54.280 --> 38:57.478
You have a hard time admitting
that you're wrong, but it's all right.

38:57.680 --> 39:01.276
People like you have
an inherent need to be right,

39:01.520 --> 39:03.796
to feel superior.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.994
You keep talking about me like
I'm some kind of alternate species.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.278
Like I'm less than human.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.233
On the contrary.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.392
Have you read any of my books?

39:16.840 --> 39:18.672
I haven't gotten around to it.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.076
Well, if you had,
you'd know that I believe

39:21.280 --> 39:25.877
that psychopaths are not
a mistake of nature.

39:26.080 --> 39:27.639
They're a gift.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.799
A gift?

39:30.000 --> 39:31.878
They're alpha wolves

39:32.080 --> 39:37.030
who helped the human race survive
long enough to become civilised.

39:37.680 --> 39:41.071
An indispensable demographic.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.313
You believe that?

39:54.880 --> 39:57.520
Did you know that
psychopathic traits

39:57.720 --> 40:00.474
can be found
in the most successful CEOs?

40:00.680 --> 40:03.354
In the most effective politicians?

40:03.800 --> 40:09.080
Without psychopaths,
mankind wouldn't exist today.

40:11.120 --> 40:14.431
Well, there's a lot of mankind
that doesn't exist because of them.

40:15.960 --> 40:18.191
Every silver lining...

40:26.960 --> 40:32.115
Well, one of your indispensable
demographics is still out there, killing.

40:32.920 --> 40:34.991
And we're back to zero.

40:35.240 --> 40:37.391
You'll find him, Dexter.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.677
I have faith in you.

40:45.360 --> 40:49.513
So, um,
what's going on with Debra?

40:51.080 --> 40:52.958
That's between me and her.

40:53.160 --> 40:54.879
It's affecting you.

40:55.080 --> 40:58.232
So it makes it a problem for me too.

40:59.120 --> 41:02.238
We're not going to talk about Deb.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.438
Whatever you want.

41:19.680 --> 41:22.639
Should I come back later?
Sorry.

41:22.840 --> 41:26.629
I was just checking
to see if Dexter called.

41:26.880 --> 41:29.520
He was looking in on Deb.

41:29.840 --> 41:31.194
Deb?

41:31.400 --> 41:32.436
Yeah.

41:32.640 --> 41:35.474
Wow, we're a whole 10 seconds
into the date.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.871
I thought we were gonna
make it to one minute

41:38.080 --> 41:40.390
before you mentioned
your old fiancée.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.393
What are you talking about?

41:42.640 --> 41:46.350
Joey, you're always checking in on her
or talking about her.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.956
Since we've been together,
you're on Deb patrol.

41:49.160 --> 41:50.992
No, I'm not.

41:51.200 --> 41:55.035
Okay. We'll do an experiment.
Let's see if you can go one whole day

41:55.280 --> 41:56.999
without mentioning Debra Morgan.

41:57.600 --> 42:00.399
What is it with you people? I mean--

42:00.600 --> 42:01.716
What people?

42:01.920 --> 42:04.754
I got your brother on my ass
about taking the sergeant's test.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.400
You're on my ass about Deb.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.512
Like, what is this,
a fucking Cuban thing?

42:08.720 --> 42:11.633
What does Angel have to do with this?
He knows we're seeing each other.

42:11.880 --> 42:14.475
He's on my ass about
making something out of my life.

42:14.640 --> 42:18.316
"Man up. Take the sergeant's test."
You know what? Maybe I don't want to.

42:18.520 --> 42:21.035
Wait, how does Angel know
that we're seeing each other?

42:21.240 --> 42:23.197
And what's wrong about
trying to better yourself?

42:23.400 --> 42:25.756
See? That's what I'm talking about.

42:26.720 --> 42:29.189
You know what? Screw this, okay?

42:29.440 --> 42:32.558
I did not get dressed up
to argue with you.

42:32.760 --> 42:34.353
Go drink by yourself.

42:35.560 --> 42:36.914
Ja--

42:45.320 --> 42:48.074
Why the hell can't you stay
out of my personal life?

42:48.280 --> 42:50.920
What'd I do?
Angel, you know exactly what you did.

42:51.120 --> 42:53.157
Okay, you're putting pressure
on Quinn.

42:53.360 --> 42:55.352
We just had a giant argument
because of you.

42:55.560 --> 42:57.950
Wait a second.
You know what, I hope you're happy.

43:01.320 --> 43:04.392
It's like, mind your own
fucking business, Angel.

43:09.120 --> 43:13.000
<i>If this finds El Sapo's killer,
it'll keep Deb safe.</i>

43:31.240 --> 43:33.277
<i>It's Deb's blood.</i>

43:36.800 --> 43:39.235
<i>She killed El Sapo.</i>

43:40.600 --> 43:42.876
<i>Shot him in his car.</i>

43:44.600 --> 43:46.159
Deb.

43:47.920 --> 43:49.559
Deb.

43:51.160 --> 43:52.833
<i>What is she doing here?</i>

43:54.400 --> 43:55.959
Morgan.

43:57.800 --> 43:58.916
Sir.

43:59.080 --> 44:01.754
I never got a chance to tell you
how disappointed I was

44:01.960 --> 44:03.235
that you left the force.

44:03.440 --> 44:06.194
From running Homicide
to chasing down bail jumpers.

44:06.400 --> 44:08.631
It's a hell of a career trajectory.

44:09.840 --> 44:11.752
It's not what you think.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.231
Well, I hope it was worth it.

44:19.080 --> 44:20.309
Debra Morgan?

44:20.520 --> 44:22.910
As I live and breathe.

44:25.800 --> 44:28.952
If I were to cop a feel now, it wouldn't
be sexual harassment anymore.

44:30.640 --> 44:32.199
Hey, stranger.
Hey.

44:32.440 --> 44:34.079
What brings you around?

44:34.240 --> 44:38.359
Um, Quinn had some questions
about a case, so...

44:38.800 --> 44:40.678
<i>Is this about El Sapo?</i>

44:40.880 --> 44:43.190
Well, he's probably
grabbing some coffee.

44:47.960 --> 44:50.555
Every morning when I come in,
I walk past it.

44:50.760 --> 44:55.277
I have to turn around, because
I still think of it as Deb's office.

44:55.480 --> 44:58.393
No, you probably should have
gotten it first, you know.

44:58.600 --> 45:00.956
I never really belonged there.

45:01.640 --> 45:03.359
You know that's BS.

45:03.560 --> 45:05.836
This place ain't the same without you.

45:07.080 --> 45:10.278
We're having some drinks
at Papa's tonight.

45:10.520 --> 45:11.556
You should come.

45:11.760 --> 45:13.956
Yeah, I'll try to make it.

45:15.840 --> 45:17.274
Hey.

45:17.640 --> 45:19.154
Thanks for coming in.

45:19.400 --> 45:20.800
Come on.

45:30.720 --> 45:34.111
I would have used
the briefing room, but it's taken.

45:34.320 --> 45:35.959
I mean, this is fine though, right?

45:36.160 --> 45:38.595
Otherwise fucking everybody'd
still be hugging you.

45:38.760 --> 45:40.114
Um...

45:40.280 --> 45:43.398
Do you wanna go to the coffee truck?
No, let's just-- Let's do this.

45:43.600 --> 45:45.159
Okay.

45:51.160 --> 45:53.152
El Sapo and Briggs.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.439
What do you want to know?

45:57.200 --> 45:59.431
Basically, we've hit a wall.

45:59.640 --> 46:02.109
I was hoping you could open up
some leads for us.

46:02.360 --> 46:03.510
What can you tell me?

46:04.600 --> 46:06.193
Um...

46:06.360 --> 46:09.751
I was doing a skip-trace on Briggs.
He robbed a jewellery store

46:09.960 --> 46:12.953
and made off with like
a half-million dollars in merchandise.

46:13.200 --> 46:15.237
I got a tip that he was
in Fort Lauderdale,

46:15.440 --> 46:18.274
and I was staking him out
and overheard

46:18.480 --> 46:20.631
that he was gonna fence
the stuff to El Sapo.

46:20.880 --> 46:22.439
Isn't a skip-trace one of those

46:22.640 --> 46:25.075
locate-and-bring-them-back
type of things?

46:26.360 --> 46:29.194
Yeah, I was also trying
to get a fix on the goods.

46:31.480 --> 46:33.790
What happened the night
Briggs was killed?

46:34.040 --> 46:35.520
Um...

46:37.640 --> 46:40.633
He was supposed to meet El Sapo
that same night.

46:41.640 --> 46:43.597
I thought they were gonna
be a few hours

46:43.800 --> 46:47.316
so I went to get a sandwich,
and when I came back,

46:47.840 --> 46:50.833
F.L.P.D. was on the scene,
and, uh,

46:52.200 --> 46:55.159
Briggs had a fucking hole
in his chest.

46:55.360 --> 46:57.750
<i>Is she lying to protect me
or to protect herself?</i>

46:58.000 --> 46:59.559
<i>I can't tell anymore.</i>

47:00.160 --> 47:03.119
I was just wondering if you could
take a look at what we've got.

47:03.320 --> 47:05.152
Maybe we could
put our heads together,

47:05.360 --> 47:08.432
push this thing down the field,
you know? Like old times.

47:09.920 --> 47:12.151
Heh. Um...

47:12.360 --> 47:15.398
So, what we think is

47:15.640 --> 47:19.554
the shooter approached
the vehicle from behind,

47:22.080 --> 47:26.040
and then El Sapo drew his gun.

47:29.440 --> 47:31.193
And then the shooter...

47:38.600 --> 47:39.716
Hey, are you all right?

47:40.920 --> 47:44.231
Sorry. Family emergency.
I gotta borrow my sister.

47:44.440 --> 47:45.794
Sure.

47:52.400 --> 47:53.834
Thanks.

48:05.560 --> 48:07.517
What, Dexter?

48:08.360 --> 48:10.795
I know you killed El Sapo.

48:12.960 --> 48:15.600
I found your blood
at the crime scene.

48:21.640 --> 48:23.359
Fuck.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.358
Tell me what happened.

48:30.520 --> 48:31.556
Talk to me, Deb.

48:31.800 --> 48:35.714
I don't know what happened, all right?
I'm a little fucking fuzzy on it.

48:38.760 --> 48:42.117
I was angry.
I wanted the jewels back.

48:43.480 --> 48:47.110
And the next thing I know,
I'm standing over a dead body.

48:47.360 --> 48:50.592
You shot at him four times.
You don't remember any of it?

48:50.800 --> 48:54.396
He'd just beaten the shit out of me.
I was a little fucked up.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.356
Why didn't you call the police?

49:01.840 --> 49:03.559
I didn't know what I could tell them.

49:04.560 --> 49:06.552
You could have called me.

49:07.360 --> 49:10.512
You get me into trouble, not out of it.
Is that why you lied to me?

49:10.760 --> 49:13.400
All of a sudden we have
a problem with lying?

49:22.080 --> 49:26.199
We found a gun in El Sapo's
glove box. Is it yours?

49:30.480 --> 49:32.631
Shit, it might be, yeah.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.357
He took it off of me
before he beat me up.

49:38.880 --> 49:42.317
It'll be traced to you.
How will you explain that?

49:45.320 --> 49:47.312
You could switch it out.

49:47.960 --> 49:49.758
Get rid of it.

49:54.720 --> 49:57.235
What if I weren't here
to cover your ass?

50:00.840 --> 50:03.230
You really want to play
the "what if" game?

50:05.040 --> 50:07.509
What if you weren't a serial killer?

50:09.280 --> 50:11.795
What if Harry had left you
in that shipping container?

50:12.000 --> 50:15.072
That's enough.
El Sapo's not the first person I shot.

50:15.320 --> 50:17.277
And he may not be the fucking last.

50:17.480 --> 50:19.278
What's that supposed to mean?

50:19.480 --> 50:23.030
Anything can happen in this hellhole
that is now my life.

50:23.240 --> 50:25.550
Your gift to me, Dexter.

50:25.760 --> 50:29.037
<i>She's right. Whoever Deb was
before killing LaGuerta,</i>

50:29.240 --> 50:31.391
<i>that person is dead.</i>

50:32.000 --> 50:34.959
<i>I just wish I knew
what's taken her place.</i>

50:40.080 --> 50:41.639
Busy day?

50:41.840 --> 50:42.910
Crazy busy.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.316
<i>Then maybe they haven't
tested Deb's gun yet.</i>

51:00.600 --> 51:04.594
<i>I've covered evidence for myself
more times than I can remember.</i>

51:06.560 --> 51:08.950
<i>But I'll never get used to
doing this for Deb.</i>

51:33.600 --> 51:36.672
You and Jamie patch things up?
How did you know we were fighting?

51:36.880 --> 51:38.997
Because I'm a good--
Detective, right.

51:40.520 --> 51:43.877
Yeah. Uh, the sergeant's test?

51:44.120 --> 51:46.954
Yeah?
I'm gonna start studying for it.

51:48.320 --> 51:50.755
Damn. Eh,

51:50.960 --> 51:52.758
you gonna make an okay sergeant.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.276
If not, I'll demote your ass.

52:36.840 --> 52:40.231
<i>Dr. Vogel says that psychopaths
are not a mistake of nature.</i>

52:40.440 --> 52:42.318
<i>They're a gift.</i>

52:43.360 --> 52:47.149
<i>But what kind of gift
destroys everything it cares about?</i>

52:54.280 --> 52:55.316
Hello?

52:55.560 --> 52:58.314
Dexter, I think there's someone
inside my house.

52:58.520 --> 52:59.920
<i>How do you know?</i>

53:00.440 --> 53:03.000
Well, I just walked up,
and the front door is open.

53:03.240 --> 53:05.675
Get in your car and stay there.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.198
If someone was inside
when I called, he's still in there.

53:28.400 --> 53:30.232
I haven't seen anyone leave.

53:31.960 --> 53:33.280
Wait here.

53:33.520 --> 53:34.954
Thank you, Dexter.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.596
Are you sure
there's no one inside?

53:49.000 --> 53:51.071
I checked the entire house.
I'm sure.

53:53.040 --> 53:54.633
That DVD, it's not mine.

53:57.960 --> 53:58.996
Put it in.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.319
He was coerced.

54:27.640 --> 54:29.518
And now he's dead.

54:36.080 --> 54:37.799
I was wrong all along.

54:38.280 --> 54:39.999
You were right.

54:41.320 --> 54:45.280
Sussman was never a real killer.
He's just another victim.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.232
I should have listened to you.

54:49.440 --> 54:52.512
You were only doing
what you thought was right.

54:52.760 --> 54:54.274
We had no idea that--

54:54.520 --> 54:57.274
You should have no idea.
You've never done this before.

54:57.520 --> 54:59.193
Me, it's what I do.

55:02.080 --> 55:04.595
The one thing
I've always been good at.

55:06.440 --> 55:09.478
Vetting, stalking, and killing people.

55:13.160 --> 55:15.629
I can't even do that anymore.

55:21.280 --> 55:26.435
What you're feeling now,
it's not because of the killer.

55:30.440 --> 55:32.113
I've...

55:34.080 --> 55:36.914
destroyed Deb.

55:39.320 --> 55:41.073
She's gone.

55:46.160 --> 55:48.470
You were wrong about me.

55:50.200 --> 55:51.600
I'm a mistake.

55:53.040 --> 55:57.193
You're exactly what you
need to be, Dexter.

56:06.920 --> 56:09.037
You're perfect.
