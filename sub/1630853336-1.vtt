I was trying to text
"patience is a virtue" to Nora,

from Borneo, and...

07:09.296 --> 07:12.264
that you should have
signed them weeks ago.

07:12.299 --> 07:14.299
I mean, you do realize
it's emotionally damaging

07:14.334 --> 07:17.610
to put me in the middle
of your divorce, right?

07:17.645 --> 07:19.271
- If we were
getting divorced,

07:19.306 --> 07:20.646
then we wouldn't
have been married,

19:01.876 --> 19:04.646
Or decency.

19:04.681 --> 19:05.977
- Or decency.

19:15.186 --> 19:18.693
Mom showed me
your suicide note.

19:18.728 --> 19:20.398
Don't.

19:20.433 --> 19:22.466
- Well, if you didn't
want anyone to read it,

19:22.501 --> 19:23.797
you shouldn't have written one.

19:23.832 --> 19:28.131
More mysterious that way.

19:28.166 --> 19:31.376
Thank you for putting me on it.

19:31.411 --> 19:34.511
Yeah, you're welcome.

19:36.713 --> 19:39.648
- Can we talk
about my placement?

19:39.683 --> 19:41.683
I was, like,
two-thirds down the list.

19:41.718 --> 19:43.652
It feels...

19:43.687 --> 19:45.687
feels like I was
an afterthought, hmm?

19:49.924 --> 19:51.627
- I just didn't want it
to go to your head.

19:51.662 --> 19:53.695
- Yeah, no, of course not.

20:01.001 --> 20:03.034
- I wanted...

20:03.069 --> 20:04.673
want...

20:04.708 --> 20:07.643
to die.

20:07.678 --> 20:09.040
This wasn't a mistake.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.415
- No.

20:10.450 --> 20:12.912
No, none of this strikes me
as a cry for help.

20:12.947 --> 20:15.816
There are people
who want you to live,

20:15.851 --> 20:19.688
so it would seem then that
you have enemies who love you.

20:19.723 --> 20:21.921
- I hate you.
- I hate you too.

20:35.266 --> 20:36.672
I'm sorry.

20:36.707 --> 20:39.873
- Oh, don't apologize.

20:39.908 --> 20:43.514
Apologies are not the bedrock
of civilized society.

20:43.549 --> 20:44.713
- Now, remind me,

20:44.748 --> 20:48.079
what is the bedrock
of civilized society?

20:48.114 --> 20:51.082
- Libraries.
- Hmm, yeah.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.559
Read any good books lately?

20:55.594 --> 20:57.121
- No.

21:11.940 --> 21:13.170
Can you leave me alone?

21:15.515 --> 21:16.415
- Yeah.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.281
Well, I'll be back tomorrow.

23:23.874 --> 23:27.040
It's not a sin.

23:27.075 --> 23:29.372

You must have seen

38:25.940 --> 38:27.841
I mean, she's a psych patient...

38:36.852 --> 38:38.522
DR.- No, not at all,

38:38.557 --> 38:43.186
but it's essential
that she take the first steps.

38:43.221 --> 38:45.925
- She's begging for help
but she wants to assert

38:45.960 --> 38:48.961
one tiny vestige of individual
power over her life.

38:48.996 --> 38:50.963
Where's the harm in that?

38:50.998 --> 38:52.635
DR.- There isn't,

38:52.670 --> 38:54.571
but it's a much
more complex dynamic

38:54.606 --> 38:57.904
than you might have learned
about in first-year psych.

38:57.939 --> 38:59.268

42:34.254 --> 42:39.224
I just wonder, and don't
take this the wrong way,

42:39.259 --> 42:41.523
you seem unhappy.

42:47.773 --> 42:49.806

42:53.779 --> 42:57.143
- Not any more
than the rest of us.

42:57.178 --> 43:00.883
- In comparison to me,
you and Mom just seem so...

43:00.918 --> 43:04.414
buoyant.

43:04.449 --> 43:05.888
Like people who
have a great capacity

43:05.923 --> 43:08.022
for dealing with things,

43:08.057 --> 43:11.223
for keeping
their heads above water.

43:15.064 --> 43:19.264
- When your father died,
he had $76 on him.

43:19.299 --> 43:22.300
Do you remember what
your mom did with that money?

43:22.335 --> 43:23.939
- No.

43:23.974 --> 43:27.712
- She used it
to get Thai takeout.

43:27.747 --> 43:29.747
I mean, what's the alternative?

43:29.782 --> 43:31.947
Keep the money and hope it will

43:31.982 --> 43:36.149
eventually reveal
some sort of answer?

43:36.184 --> 43:38.448
- The food wasn't that good,
if I remember correctly.

43:38.483 --> 43:41.220
- Or maybe it was
the best takeout ever,

43:41.255 --> 43:43.695
but to you...

43:43.730 --> 43:45.620
it still tasted like shit.

43:56.303 --> 43:58.435
- What's this?

43:58.470 --> 44:00.503
- It came in the mail
today for Elf.

44:02.848 --> 44:06.278
- It's very...
specific and thorough

44:06.313 --> 44:08.511
in explaining all the ways
to commit suicide.

44:08.546 --> 44:10.645
- She was able to order
this from her hospital bed?

44:10.680 --> 44:13.450
- No, before
she tried to kill herself.

44:13.485 --> 44:15.221
It was on back order.

44:15.256 --> 44:16.827
- You should throw it away.
- I can't.

44:16.862 --> 44:18.455
That's an invasion
of her privacy.

44:18.490 --> 44:20.325
You can't just throw out
someone else's mail.

44:20.360 --> 44:22.129
- Well, then hide it
in the back of a closet

44:22.164 --> 44:26.034
until she stops being suicidal.

44:26.069 --> 44:28.201
So, I was thinking.

44:28.236 --> 44:31.666
What if we did
something extreme with Elf?

44:31.701 --> 44:35.703
Like, we parachute her into
North Korea or Mogadishu,

44:35.738 --> 44:38.046
or, like, Baffin Island,

44:38.081 --> 44:40.180
and she's forced to survive
on her own like never before.

44:40.215 --> 44:42.512
Maybe it would jolt her
into a new notion

44:42.547 --> 44:43.711
of what it means to be alive.

44:43.746 --> 44:46.186
Like, her adrenal gland
would kickstart

44:46.221 --> 44:48.716
a new life strategy
and then she'll realize

44:48.751 --> 44:51.862
that she doesn't
actually want to die.

44:51.897 --> 44:55.261
- Are you fucking serious?

44:55.296 --> 44:56.592
- I realize
that the plan has

44:56.627 --> 44:58.528
a number of
logistical challenges.

44:58.563 --> 45:00.662
- Like a child soldier
killing her?

45:00.697 --> 45:02.873
Or the fact that
she doesn't parachute?

45:02.908 --> 45:05.172
- So, what?

45:05.207 --> 45:08.670
We wait, in the hope
that miraculously,

45:08.705 --> 45:10.507
pragmatism, psychiatry,

45:10.542 --> 45:13.015
and pharmaceuticals
will save the day?

45:13.050 --> 45:15.281
- Doesn't she seem
to be getting better?

45:15.316 --> 45:16.678
- Based on what evidence?

45:16.713 --> 45:19.252
- She was asking
about Claudio, the tour.

45:19.287 --> 45:21.617
- She asked about the tour?
- Yes.

45:21.652 --> 45:23.960
- Without prompting?
- Yes.

45:38.471 --> 45:39.404
- Hello?

45:43.212 --> 45:45.377
- YVR.

45:45.412 --> 45:49.612
Your initials are the same
as the Vancouver Airport code.

45:49.647 --> 45:51.086
I thought it was you
when you called.

45:51.121 --> 45:53.616
I don't know too
many other Yolis.

45:53.651 --> 45:55.926
- It's good
to see you again.

45:55.961 --> 45:59.292
So, how's my mother's car?

45:59.327 --> 46:03.197
- Yeah, that's a different
story altogether, isn't it?

46:03.232 --> 46:05.595
- It was a snapshot,

46:05.630 --> 46:07.300
and then I realized
that in the last 15 years,

46:07.335 --> 46:09.599
I've morphed into
all these other selves.

46:09.634 --> 46:12.074
A soon-to-be-divorced woman
who left her husband

46:12.109 --> 46:15.704
for reasons that seemed
valid at the time.

46:15.739 --> 46:18.707
A grotesquely
undiscerning lover.

46:18.742 --> 46:21.380
A mother who's afraid her
parenting will be the cause

46:21.415 --> 46:24.482
of her child's
unhappiness, and...

46:24.517 --> 46:27.584
sitting in his truck,

46:27.619 --> 46:29.861
we were so... old.

46:32.360 --> 46:34.261
- When I saw you,
all I could think about

46:34.296 --> 46:38.100
was our younger selves,
like how different I was at 21,

46:38.135 --> 46:41.906
how full of optimism,
expectations.

46:41.941 --> 46:43.666
And now, um...

46:43.701 --> 46:45.239
- I know what you mean.

46:45.274 --> 46:49.639
I was punching way above my
weight even going to university.

46:49.674 --> 46:52.015
I mean,
never mind creative writing.

46:52.050 --> 46:53.676
Oh my god.

46:53.711 --> 46:56.921
Yeah, I never graduated.

46:56.956 --> 46:58.450
- Any regrets?
- No.

46:58.485 --> 47:02.619
I mean, not about that.

47:02.654 --> 47:06.326
Did you know I had a nickname?

47:06.361 --> 47:07.998
- No,
I don't remember that.

47:08.033 --> 47:09.395
YOLI V.O.: Of course I knew.

47:09.430 --> 47:11.133
I was the one
who gave it to him.

47:11.168 --> 47:12.937
- Yeah, Sad Jason.

47:12.972 --> 47:15.137
- Really?
Why?

47:15.172 --> 47:18.173
- The only reason
I even enrolled in university

47:18.208 --> 47:21.506
in the first place
is because I had this girlfriend

47:21.541 --> 47:24.113
in high school,
and I was very in love,

47:24.148 --> 47:26.511
and she broke up with me,

47:26.546 --> 47:30.548
and I just was wandering around,
you know, in a daze,

47:30.583 --> 47:35.058
couldn't concentrate,
so I became Sad Jason.

47:35.093 --> 47:40.360
I truly was the Eeyore
of undergraduates.

47:43.068 --> 47:46.729
- Yeah, well,
aside from the alliteration,

47:46.764 --> 47:51.404
there's irony
as history repeats itself.

47:51.439 --> 47:54.605
I am in the middle
of a divorce.

47:54.640 --> 47:56.838
- You okay?
- Yeah.

47:56.873 --> 47:59.115
God, at least
we don't have kids.

47:59.150 --> 48:01.513
That would be awful.
- Yeah.

48:03.781 --> 48:04.714
Yeah.

48:09.127 --> 48:10.588
Have you ever
been to Rotterdam?

48:13.791 --> 48:15.758
- ...Yeah!

48:15.793 --> 48:18.035
Good times.
You?

48:18.070 --> 48:21.533
- No.

48:21.568 --> 48:23.898
I feel like I'm being weird.
I'm sorry.

48:23.933 --> 48:26.868
- That's
how I remember you.

48:26.903 --> 48:30.839
- It's been
really nice to talk.

48:30.874 --> 48:33.281
- Hmm.

48:33.316 --> 48:36.581
YOLI V.O.: And so,
I imagined we were...

48:36.616 --> 48:40.915
young and horny and very happy.

48:40.950 --> 48:42.620
Afterwards,
he wanted to know why

48:42.655 --> 48:45.128
I asked him about Rotterdam,
so I told him

48:45.163 --> 48:48.428
the premise of the book
I'm trying to write.

48:48.463 --> 48:51.200
- There's this harbourmaster
who ends up on a ship

48:51.235 --> 48:52.465
that he kind of shouldn't be on,

48:52.500 --> 48:53.796
like he should
have gotten off it,

48:53.831 --> 48:55.567
but there's a storm,

48:55.602 --> 48:57.767
and so he can't get onto
his little boat to go back home,

48:57.802 --> 48:59.637
so he's stuck on this ship
going to Rotterdam,

48:59.672 --> 49:01.870
and then he misses
this meeting.

49:01.905 --> 49:05.247
Like, everything
goes wrong for him.

49:05.282 --> 49:07.513
- Wouldn't he be able
to explain to her

49:07.548 --> 49:10.615
he's trapped
with technology now?

49:10.650 --> 49:11.946
Text or whatever.

49:11.981 --> 49:15.092
- I know,
but for some reason he can't.

49:15.127 --> 49:16.720
I'm just-- I'm having
structural problems.

49:16.755 --> 49:19.096
- Your structure
is amazing.

49:19.131 --> 49:20.361
ELF V.O.: Please tell me
he didn't say,

49:20.396 --> 49:21.956
"Your structure is amazing."

49:21.991 --> 49:23.760
- Those were
his exact words.

49:23.795 --> 49:27.071
- Did you just
throw up all over him?

49:27.106 --> 49:28.501
- Yours too.

49:28.536 --> 49:30.833
- Oh, god!

49:30.868 --> 49:33.000
- I just think
the thing is about your book,

49:33.035 --> 49:35.640
it should move really fast.

49:35.675 --> 49:37.312
You know,
like pedal to the metal,

49:37.347 --> 49:39.644
so it doesn't get boring.
- Mm-hm.

49:39.679 --> 49:43.351
- Plus,
writing is so hard, right?

49:43.386 --> 49:46.453
You just want to get in there
and get the job done

49:46.488 --> 49:51.194
and get out,
like cleaning septic tanks.

49:51.229 --> 49:53.163
- Definitely.

49:53.198 --> 49:55.528
YOLI V.O.: Elf,
he compared writing

49:55.563 --> 49:57.695
to cleaning septic tanks.

49:57.730 --> 49:58.993
- Yeah.

49:59.028 --> 50:00.995
YOLI V.O.: The more
I thought about it,

50:01.030 --> 50:03.338
the more the analogy
didn't seem so shitty.

50:03.373 --> 50:05.703
ELF V.O.: Oh, come on,
you go with the easiest

50:05.738 --> 50:08.145
and most obvious pun
and you call yourself a writer?

50:08.180 --> 50:10.345
- Stop it.
Stop it!

50:15.913 --> 50:19.486
- As I brought my fingers
to my nose to check

50:19.521 --> 50:23.358
if I reeked of motor oil or sex,

50:23.393 --> 50:27.659
I felt so ashamed.

50:27.694 --> 50:31.058
- Shame is so unnecessary.

50:31.093 --> 50:33.368
- Maybe.
Maybe not.

50:35.768 --> 50:40.705
Shame motivates us to say we're
sorry and to seek forgiveness.

50:40.740 --> 50:42.476
It also motivates
some of us to write books

50:42.511 --> 50:45.347
as a futile attempt
at atonement.

50:45.382 --> 50:47.184
Shame helps
to fuck up relationships,

50:47.219 --> 50:50.385
and we all know fucked up
relationships are the lifeblood

50:50.420 --> 50:54.356
of books and movies and theatre.

50:54.391 --> 50:58.426
Get rid of shame
and you can kiss art goodbye.

50:58.461 --> 51:01.660
But I long for a life
without shame.

51:04.236 --> 51:06.104
- You look so defeated.

51:09.571 --> 51:11.868
- Tell me, Elf,
how should I look?

51:13.575 --> 51:16.213
- Well,
it was just an observation.

51:16.248 --> 51:18.413
- Hmm,
it didn't sound like one.

51:21.880 --> 51:22.780
- Okay.

51:26.324 --> 51:29.556
Yoli...

51:29.591 --> 51:31.690
You gotta keep
your shit together.

51:31.725 --> 51:34.396
Especially for Mom.

51:34.431 --> 51:38.433
- Are you
fucking kidding me?

51:38.468 --> 51:40.336
Oh my god.

51:40.371 --> 51:42.965
Oh my god, look at you.

51:46.476 --> 51:49.576
- I don't want
to do this right now.

51:49.611 --> 51:51.413
- Has it occurred to you
that I'm the one

51:51.448 --> 51:52.744
who's colossally fucked up?

51:52.779 --> 51:55.142
That my entire life
is embarrassing?

51:55.177 --> 51:57.188
The having a kid at 18,
the divorce,

51:57.223 --> 51:58.783
the pathetic affairs,
the mediocre novels,

51:58.818 --> 52:01.258
fucking all of it
is a clusterfuck--

52:01.293 --> 52:04.151
and even worse, a cliché!
- Okay.

52:04.186 --> 52:06.593
- Has it occurred to you
that I also lost my father

52:06.628 --> 52:09.233
to suicide and I'm having
a hard time getting over it?

52:09.268 --> 52:11.862
That I also am struggling
to find meaning in my pathetic,

52:11.897 --> 52:14.964
stupid life and that I also
think that this whole thing

52:14.999 --> 52:16.966
is a ridiculous farce and
the only intelligent response

52:17.001 --> 52:18.506
would be to kill myself?
But I pull back

52:18.541 --> 52:20.442
from that conclusion
because it creates

52:20.477 --> 52:22.378
a certain onus
that is unpalatable,

52:22.413 --> 52:24.644
like your fucking
Virginia Woolf.

52:24.679 --> 52:26.514
You have...

52:26.549 --> 52:30.177
you have an amazing partner
who loves you

52:30.212 --> 52:32.322
and a career that
the whole world respects

52:32.357 --> 52:33.983
and gives you shitloads
of money for,

52:34.018 --> 52:36.524
a career that you could leave at
any moment and just be labelled

52:36.559 --> 52:38.185
"mysterious" or "eccentric,"
and go live in Paris

52:38.220 --> 52:39.824
in the fucking Marais
or whatever that--

52:39.859 --> 52:41.826
that fucking arrond, arrondis--
- It's called the arrond--

52:41.861 --> 52:43.157
- Don't you
fucking correct me

52:43.192 --> 52:44.664
with your superior
knowledge of French!

52:44.699 --> 52:46.468
You have a beautiful house
that magically cleans itself.

52:46.503 --> 52:48.800
- I have a cleaning lady,
Yoli.

52:48.835 --> 52:50.505
You have a low-grade
understanding of despair,

52:50.540 --> 52:51.803
by the way.

52:51.838 --> 52:54.872
- Can you not see
that I need your help?

52:54.907 --> 52:56.511
That maybe you're
here for a reason,

52:56.546 --> 52:58.315
which is to be a sister to me?!

52:58.350 --> 53:01.351
- You have had my help
all along, okay?

53:01.386 --> 53:03.584
I had to be perfect
so you could fuck up,

53:03.619 --> 53:05.883
and you were more than happy
to take on that role!

53:05.918 --> 53:08.754
Also, you know, one of us
had to show some fucking empathy

53:08.789 --> 53:10.888
towards Dad and his
acres of existential sadness.

53:10.923 --> 53:12.824
- Why?
- Because nobody else would!

53:12.859 --> 53:14.155
- That means we chose life.

53:14.190 --> 53:15.893
It doesn't mean we don't
or we didn't fucking care.

53:15.928 --> 53:17.895
- You don't
understand a fucking thing!

53:17.930 --> 53:19.226
- I do understand!

53:19.261 --> 53:21.063
Just be like the rest of us:

53:21.098 --> 53:23.439
get fat, start smoking,
play piano badly, whatever.

53:23.474 --> 53:26.002
Just know that you'll eventually
get what you want most in life.

53:26.037 --> 53:28.543
- What's that?
- Death.

53:28.578 --> 53:31.073
So why can't you wait
around and be patient

53:31.108 --> 53:32.712
like the rest of us?

53:32.747 --> 53:34.846
Hasn't Mom suffered enough?
- That is so...

53:34.881 --> 53:37.112
- You just love the fucking
perverse idea of an encore.

53:37.147 --> 53:39.147
- Shut up!
You shut up!

54:15.658 --> 54:17.790
- Can't we just talk?

54:19.563 --> 54:21.255
- About what?

54:24.326 --> 54:27.767
- Anything.

54:27.802 --> 54:29.439
- Sure.

54:29.474 --> 54:34.642
But you seem to want me
to follow some hidden script,

54:34.677 --> 54:37.172
and when I veer from it,

54:37.207 --> 54:39.548
because I don't know
what it is in the first place,

54:39.583 --> 54:44.146
you're like,
"No, don't talk."

54:44.181 --> 54:48.183
You don't want me to talk about
the past because it's painful,

54:48.218 --> 54:51.659
because there were good times.

54:51.694 --> 54:53.155
There's life,

54:53.190 --> 54:55.432
and maybe it'll persuade you
to change your mind.

54:55.467 --> 54:57.764
And you don't want me
to talk about the future

54:57.799 --> 55:00.437
because you don't see one.

55:00.472 --> 55:05.442
So, um...

55:05.477 --> 55:09.171
okay, I'll just talk
about this moment.

55:12.176 --> 55:15.683
I inhaled.

55:15.718 --> 55:19.181
I exhaled.

55:19.216 --> 55:22.217
I'm standing up.

55:22.252 --> 55:26.122
I'm walking over here.

55:26.157 --> 55:29.631
A second is passing,

55:29.666 --> 55:32.436
and another one...

55:32.471 --> 55:36.033
and another one.

55:36.068 --> 55:38.409
- Have you thought
any more about Switzerland?

55:44.406 --> 55:46.681
- Does Nic know?

55:46.716 --> 55:48.584
- He would never take me.

55:48.619 --> 55:50.850
It has to be you.

55:50.885 --> 55:52.951
- What about Mom?
Did you tell her?

55:52.986 --> 55:56.284
- Yoli, listen to me.

55:56.319 --> 56:00.387
Mom and Nic can't know.

56:00.422 --> 56:02.829
Nic still believes
in some kind of medicine

56:02.864 --> 56:05.568
that's gonna cure me.
And Mom...

56:05.603 --> 56:08.164
Mom believes in
I don't know what.

56:08.199 --> 56:10.034
God?

56:10.069 --> 56:12.608
Or odds.

56:12.643 --> 56:16.645
But she's never gonna give up.

56:16.680 --> 56:21.243
It has to be you.

56:21.278 --> 56:23.410
- So, what?
We just sneak off to Zurich,

56:23.445 --> 56:25.522
just the two of us?

56:25.557 --> 56:28.118
- Yeah, why not?

56:28.153 --> 56:30.494
- Because Nic
would notice in five minutes

56:30.529 --> 56:31.924
that you were gone.
He would...

56:31.959 --> 56:34.388
he would put it
together somehow,

56:34.423 --> 56:36.423
find a paper trail.
Then he'd hate me,

56:36.458 --> 56:37.864
and Mom would have
a heart attack.

56:37.899 --> 56:39.932
It's so ridiculous, Elf.

56:39.967 --> 56:41.571
It's so improbable.

56:41.606 --> 56:43.936
- If you love me, Yoli,
you would take me.

56:43.971 --> 56:45.234
- I do love you.

56:45.269 --> 56:49.172
I love you so--

56:49.207 --> 56:51.075
- These came for you.

56:51.110 --> 56:52.846
- Oh, okay.
Yeah.

56:52.881 --> 56:55.442
You can give those to me.

56:55.477 --> 56:57.246
Thank you.

57:33.856 --> 57:36.989

1:00:58.555 --> 1:01:01.292
three days ago,
and they're still not here.

1:01:01.327 --> 1:01:04.295
What's the problem?

1:01:04.330 --> 1:01:06.429
- You're young,
you're in love.

1:01:06.464 --> 1:01:09.498
Irony is your
default mechanism.

1:01:09.533 --> 1:01:12.039
"Let's get matching tattoos!

1:01:12.074 --> 1:01:16.813
"Let us slay hypocrisy
with jokes and magic."

1:01:16.848 --> 1:01:18.848
- Till death do us part.

1:01:26.990 --> 1:01:28.286
- Hey, Mom.

1:01:28.321 --> 1:01:31.795
- Your aunt,
she fainted today.

1:01:33.755 --> 1:01:36.129
- What-- is--
is she alright?

1:01:36.164 --> 1:01:37.526
- Well, she broke her arm

1:01:37.561 --> 1:01:40.529
and they've admitted her
to a chief cardiology.

1:01:40.564 --> 1:01:43.004
- Cardiology for her arm?

1:01:43.039 --> 1:01:46.667
- No.
She's having chest pains.

1:01:46.702 --> 1:01:50.440
That's why she fainted.

1:01:50.475 --> 1:01:53.113
- Okay.

1:02:22.705 --> 1:02:26.278
- Whoa,
what's your problem?

1:02:27.886 --> 1:02:29.545
- Excuse me?

1:02:29.580 --> 1:02:31.283
- You're way
too close to my car.

1:02:31.318 --> 1:02:34.253
If you scratch it, I swear,
there'll be hell to pay.

1:02:34.288 --> 1:02:36.684
- Hell to pay?

1:02:36.719 --> 1:02:39.093
Did you really just say
there'd be hell to pay

1:02:39.128 --> 1:02:41.458
if I touch your fucking car?

1:02:41.493 --> 1:02:45.902
Can't you see that my car
isn't touching your fucking car?

1:02:45.937 --> 1:02:48.102
- Hey,
what's your fucking problem?

1:02:48.137 --> 1:02:50.632
- My problem?
My problem!

1:02:50.667 --> 1:02:52.139
Fuck you!

1:02:52.174 --> 1:02:53.602
My problem is that
I have to go upstairs

1:02:53.637 --> 1:02:55.472
and see if my sister
feels like living today

1:02:55.507 --> 1:02:57.540
or if they can fix my aunt's
literal broken heart.

1:02:57.575 --> 1:02:59.377
And in case you haven't noticed,
the parking spots

1:02:59.412 --> 1:03:01.280
in this hospital are
really fucking small!

1:03:01.315 --> 1:03:03.315
Hey, excuse me,
are you guys together?

1:03:03.350 --> 1:03:05.251
Is this shithead
the baby's father?

1:03:05.286 --> 1:03:08.089
Uh, just let me know one thing.

1:03:08.124 --> 1:03:09.783
Um, has he ever
cared about a human

1:03:09.818 --> 1:03:11.994
as much as he cares
about his fucking car?

1:03:12.029 --> 1:03:13.754
- Okay, okay, okay.

1:03:13.789 --> 1:03:15.789
- And God forbid
the biggest tragedy in his life

1:03:15.824 --> 1:03:17.461
is that his car may
get a fucking scratch!

1:03:17.496 --> 1:03:18.660
What the fuck are you doing?

1:03:18.695 --> 1:03:20.101
- I've got your
license plate number.

1:03:20.136 --> 1:03:21.465
Just don't hit the car.

1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:23.071
- Hey, don't you
fucking walk away from me!

1:03:23.106 --> 1:03:24.435
I am not finished yet!

1:03:24.470 --> 1:03:25.667
- Let's go, let's go.

1:03:25.702 --> 1:03:26.943
- Do you want
my fucking insurance?!

1:03:26.978 --> 1:03:28.307
You can have that!
Do you want my, uh,

1:03:28.342 --> 1:03:30.507
my tax returns
for the last ten years?!

1:03:30.542 --> 1:03:32.608

- Hey, fuck you!

1:03:32.643 --> 1:03:35.952
Hey, fuck you,

1:03:35.987 --> 1:03:38.317

he's living in London now?

He said it was the most
amazing thing he ever heard.

1:05:31.795 --> 1:05:36.402
By the way, we were always very
supportive of her piano playing.

1:05:36.437 --> 1:05:37.964

- Oh.
- Elfrieda?

1:05:47.283 --> 1:05:48.612
We were just talking about her.

1:05:48.647 --> 1:05:50.218
Don't tell me
she's in hospital too.

1:05:50.253 --> 1:05:53.584
- Yes, she cut her wrists
because she wanted to die.

1:05:55.225 --> 1:05:56.488
How's Gerhard?

1:05:56.523 --> 1:05:59.029

let's keep on moving.

1:05:59.064 --> 1:06:02.296
Really nice to see you,
Mrs. Funk.

1:06:02.331 --> 1:06:04.958

1:06:22.186 --> 1:06:24.450
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:06:28.984 --> 1:06:31.457
- How's Aunt Tina?

1:06:31.492 --> 1:06:34.559
- Mm, you know, considering
she has a broken arm

1:06:34.594 --> 1:06:38.035
and they're about to open up
her heart, okay, I guess.

1:06:40.732 --> 1:06:43.073
- And Mom?

1:06:45.275 --> 1:06:47.275
- Stoic, as usual.

1:06:52.843 --> 1:06:55.008
Do you...

1:06:55.043 --> 1:06:58.220
do you remember
the letters you sent to me

1:06:58.255 --> 1:07:00.156
after I broke up
with that guy in Montreal

1:07:00.191 --> 1:07:03.126
and I was living alone?

1:07:03.161 --> 1:07:05.557
- No, I don't think so.

1:07:05.592 --> 1:07:08.164
- It was a quote
from Paul Valéry,

1:07:08.199 --> 1:07:10.694
and every day
a letter would arrive

1:07:10.729 --> 1:07:12.696
with a single word
written on it.

1:07:17.703 --> 1:07:20.275
"Breath."

1:07:20.310 --> 1:07:23.806
- "Dreams."

1:07:23.841 --> 1:07:27.073
- "Silence."

1:07:27.108 --> 1:07:30.351
- "Invincible calm."

1:07:30.386 --> 1:07:32.947

- Probably not.

Dr. Johns.
DR.- Yes?

- She...
she's not ready.

1:12:26.979 --> 1:12:30.948
She's pretending to be
normal, sane, cured,

1:12:30.983 --> 1:12:33.082
and I'm sure you're thinking,
"Okay, let's free up a bed.

1:12:33.117 --> 1:12:34.622

please don't do that.

1:12:40.256 --> 1:12:42.432
DR.- She's on
the right path,

1:12:42.467 --> 1:12:44.665
and it's very important for
the patient to feel empowered

1:12:44.700 --> 1:12:46.436
by being allowed
to make big decisions.

1:12:46.471 --> 1:12:48.504
- Well, one big
decision she could make

1:12:48.539 --> 1:12:50.297
would be the decision
to kill herself,

1:12:50.332 --> 1:12:51.705
and we can assume
that nobody wants

1:12:51.740 --> 1:12:53.872
her to make that
decision, right?

1:12:53.907 --> 1:12:55.874
Last week,
she's completely depressed.

1:12:55.909 --> 1:12:58.041
Asked me to take her to
a suicide clinic in Switzerland,

1:12:58.076 --> 1:13:01.781
and this week,

1:13:01.816 --> 1:13:04.410
what, she's just better?

1:13:04.445 --> 1:13:05.917
For what reason?

1:13:05.952 --> 1:13:07.754
DR.- She's agreed
to take her medications,

1:13:07.789 --> 1:13:09.525
book follow-up appointments,
so I have to give her

1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:12.022
the benefit of the doubt.

1:13:12.057 --> 1:13:15.289
I've seen many patients leave
here in worse shape than her

1:13:15.324 --> 1:13:18.094
and yet thrive once
they return to their lives.

- No offence, but the payout
from your life insurance policy

1:29:06.043 --> 1:29:10.210
doesn't really buy a whole lot
of house in Toronto these days.

1:29:10.245 --> 1:29:12.817
- Do you like
the monthly stipend of $2,000

1:29:12.852 --> 1:29:14.819
so you can finally
finish your novel?

1:29:14.854 --> 1:29:18.185
- A stipend?

1:29:18.220 --> 1:29:19.956
I couldn't believe
you actually used that word

1:29:19.991 --> 1:29:22.123
in your will.

1:29:22.158 --> 1:29:25.995
So Virginia Woolf.

1:29:26.030 --> 1:29:28.393
- "A woman must have money

1:29:28.428 --> 1:29:32.639
"and a room of her own
if she is to write fiction."

1:29:32.674 --> 1:29:36.038
So you finally got Mom
to move to Toronto?

1:29:36.073 --> 1:29:39.041
- It was time
to circle our wagons.

1:29:39.076 --> 1:29:41.582
We've lost half our men,
supplies are dwindling,

1:29:41.617 --> 1:29:44.816
and winter is coming.

1:29:44.851 --> 1:29:48.853
There was no debate,
no discussion.

1:29:48.888 --> 1:29:51.053
We three ladies
will live in this old,

1:29:51.088 --> 1:29:53.154
wretched house thanks to you.

1:29:58.634 --> 1:30:01.393
- How are you feeling?
- Okay, I guess.

1:30:01.428 --> 1:30:04.231
Some days are better
than others.

1:30:04.266 --> 1:30:06.431
- Man, I keep thinking
how hard it must be,

1:30:06.466 --> 1:30:08.301
especially because
she died by her own hand.

1:30:08.336 --> 1:30:10.435
- Okay...

1:30:10.470 --> 1:30:12.745
Can you please not say
"Died by her own hand"?

1:30:12.780 --> 1:30:14.208
- Sorry,
how should I say it?

1:30:14.243 --> 1:30:16.210
- She killed herself.

1:30:16.245 --> 1:30:17.409
If someone gets murdered,
do you say,

1:30:17.444 --> 1:30:20.753
"They died by another's hand"?

1:30:20.788 --> 1:30:23.855
This isn't
The Count of Monte Cristo.

1:30:23.890 --> 1:30:25.120
- I can't help but think

1:30:25.155 --> 1:30:27.320
it just seems like
such a selfish act.

1:30:27.355 --> 1:30:28.761
- Selfish?

1:30:28.796 --> 1:30:31.192
How can it be selfish?
If you...

1:30:31.227 --> 1:30:32.798
if you haven't felt
agony firsthand,

1:30:32.833 --> 1:30:36.296
you can't pass judgement.

1:30:36.331 --> 1:30:39.970
- Can I get
a refill, please?

1:30:40.005 --> 1:30:41.972
- Actually lately,
more and more,

1:30:42.007 --> 1:30:44.546
I've begun to measure a person's
character and integrity

1:30:44.581 --> 1:30:46.911
by their ability
to kill themselves.

1:30:46.946 --> 1:30:48.341
- This ought to be good.

1:30:48.376 --> 1:30:50.376
- Thank you.

1:30:50.411 --> 1:30:52.785
What the hell are
you talking about?

1:30:52.820 --> 1:30:54.248
- Vladimir Putin?
No way.

1:30:54.283 --> 1:30:56.525
Jeremy Irons?
Yeah.

1:30:56.560 --> 1:30:58.219
Donald Trump?

1:30:58.254 --> 1:31:02.058
Like, no question, not a chance.
That kind of thing.

1:31:02.093 --> 1:31:04.632
- And me?

1:31:04.667 --> 1:31:06.667
Do I have what it takes
to kill myself?

1:31:24.786 --> 1:31:26.654
- When I looked up
Final Exit on Amazon,

1:31:26.689 --> 1:31:29.756
I was shocked by how high
the user ratings were.

1:31:29.791 --> 1:31:31.692
There were a couple of
verified purchasers

1:31:31.727 --> 1:31:33.518
who left glowing reviews
despite the fact

1:31:33.553 --> 1:31:37.896
that it was found next to
the bodies of their loved ones.

1:31:41.836 --> 1:31:45.167
- I have to
ask you something.

1:31:45.202 --> 1:31:47.774
Why do you keep
calling the hospital?

1:31:50.108 --> 1:31:52.471
- I don't.

1:31:52.506 --> 1:31:54.341
What?

1:31:54.376 --> 1:31:57.179
- I tracked
your activities.

1:31:57.214 --> 1:31:59.445
I've seen the cell phone bills,
the calls,

1:31:59.480 --> 1:32:01.447
the empty wine bottles.

1:32:01.482 --> 1:32:04.153
- Looks like all your years
of reading mystery novels

1:32:04.188 --> 1:32:05.759
is finally paying off.

1:32:09.160 --> 1:32:12.029
- Are you trying to haunt
the hospital for letting her go?

1:32:19.104 --> 1:32:20.807
- That's
an interesting theory.

1:32:20.842 --> 1:32:22.809
Um...

1:32:22.844 --> 1:32:24.679
I don't know what I'm doing.

1:32:26.716 --> 1:32:28.584
- It has to stop.

1:32:38.123 --> 1:32:41.861
- They screwed up!

1:33:02.884 --> 1:33:04.246
- I'm sorry.

1:33:04.281 --> 1:33:06.050
- Mm-mm.

1:33:15.622 --> 1:33:19.228
You know,
we can all fight really hard,

1:33:19.263 --> 1:33:22.594
but we can also
acknowledge defeat,

1:33:22.629 --> 1:33:25.971
stop fighting,
and just call a spade a spade.

1:33:29.812 --> 1:33:34.210
- What do you do
when a spade isn't a spade?

1:33:34.245 --> 1:33:38.214
- Well, yeah, there
are things like that in life

1:33:38.249 --> 1:33:41.481
that aren't spades,
and we can just let them...

1:33:41.516 --> 1:33:44.924
stay that way.

1:33:44.959 --> 1:33:47.289
- I'm a writer.
It's very difficult

1:33:47.324 --> 1:33:51.194
for me to leave those
spades so undefined.

1:33:51.229 --> 1:33:53.130
- I realize that.

1:33:58.005 --> 1:34:02.007
The problem is
the pain of letting go

1:34:02.042 --> 1:34:05.670
of grief is...

1:34:05.705 --> 1:34:08.145
it's just as painful,

1:34:08.180 --> 1:34:11.786
even more painful
than the grief itself.

1:34:14.549 --> 1:34:17.418
We're meant to move on.
