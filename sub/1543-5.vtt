WEBVTT

00:27.928 --> 00:31.671
Oh, no. Whatever could that be?

00:37.170 --> 00:39.878
Ghost, meet Winchester.

00:40.073 --> 00:41.416
Cut!

00:41.608 --> 00:44.179
Maggie. Siobhan.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.692
Is this some kind of a joke to you?

00:50.851 --> 00:54.025
Siobhan, this scene takes place...

00:54.221 --> 00:57.930
...before the events of Carver Edlund's
unpublished masterpiece...

00:58.125 --> 00:59.866
...Dark Side of the Moon.

01:00.961 --> 01:04.568
- So?
- Meaning, where is the Samulet?

01:04.765 --> 01:06.301
Oh...

01:06.533 --> 01:09.104
I took it off.
It kept hitting me in the lips and...

01:09.303 --> 01:12.113
That amulet is a symbol
of the Winchesters' brotherly love.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.910
You need to take one for the team.

01:14.641 --> 01:16.917
Look, I'm just here for the college credit.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.755
Ugh. How dare you?

01:21.949 --> 01:24.828
People. People.

01:26.420 --> 01:30.095
Okay. I've had three weeks of
this crap-show, and I am done.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.634
There is too much drama
in the Drama Department.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.136
I'm going to Principal Salazar
in the morning.

01:35.329 --> 01:38.071
- No, no, no. Mrs. Chandler, please.
- It's over, Marie.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.981
All right. Everybody back to one.

01:45.172 --> 01:48.779
Until we are all suspended,
the show must go on.

01:49.309 --> 01:53.780
Why couldn't they just do Godspell
like good little skanks?

01:53.981 --> 01:59.260
Instead, it's this awful,
unbelievable horror story.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.932
Mm!

02:01.488 --> 02:03.490
Like that stuff really happens.

02:04.691 --> 02:09.106
Theater is about life, you know?
Truth. Truth.

02:09.596 --> 02:12.509
Where is the truth in Supernatural?

02:28.615 --> 02:30.561
Get it off! Get off!

02:40.027 --> 02:44.498
I mean, it's close. But it just...
It needs a little more - argh!

03:11.892 --> 03:15.738
I can see her lying back in her satin dress

03:15.929 --> 03:21.208
In a room where you do
What you don't confess

03:21.401 --> 03:24.405
Sundown, you better take care

03:24.604 --> 03:27.414
If I find you been creeping

03:27.607 --> 03:30.281
'Round my back stairs

03:30.510 --> 03:33.787
Sundown, you better take care...

03:34.014 --> 03:35.960
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:36.183 --> 03:40.290
- How long you been up'?
- Long enough to find us a case.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.232
I take it that means
you're feeling back to normal?

03:44.424 --> 03:46.529
Yeah, whatever normal is in our world.

03:47.861 --> 03:51.240
So, uh, right here. Ahem.

03:51.431 --> 03:54.969
A teacher at an all-girls school
went missing in Flint, Michigan.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.307
She was, uh, headed to her car
and then disappeared.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.040
Nobody's seen her since.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.223
There's nothing here
that even remotely suggests there's a case.

04:05.746 --> 04:09.455
There is nothing there that even remotely
suggests there isn't a case. Boom.

04:09.649 --> 04:13.597
- Come on, man.
- Sam, out there hunting...

04:14.054 --> 04:15.761
it's the only normal I know.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.661
We got work to do.

04:31.338 --> 04:34.842
Oh, of course. Yes, I'd
certainly appreciate it.

04:35.075 --> 04:37.146
You got it. Thanks, officer.

04:38.478 --> 04:41.482
So the last place Mrs. Chandler
was seen by anyone...

04:41.681 --> 04:43.024
...was in the auditorium.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.696
Turns out she's the drama teacher.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.990
Theater kids. Great.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.327
- Well, I was a theater kid.
- Barely.

04:50.524 --> 04:53.835
You did Our Town, which was cool.
But then you did that crappy musical.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.598
Oklahoma!?
Hugh Jackman got cast off Oklahoma!

04:56.797 --> 04:59.038
You ran tech, Wolverine.

04:59.499 --> 05:01.103
Shut up.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.124
If you gentlemen need anything else,
just let me know.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.350
Great. Thanks, Ms. Salazar.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.963
Idiots.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.369
You idiots.

05:28.995 --> 05:33.501
- You are idiots.
- Hey, assbutt.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.202
Hey, assbutt.

05:36.903 --> 05:40.009
John and Mary, husband and wife

05:40.207 --> 05:43.313
Bringing home a brand-new life

05:43.510 --> 05:48.687
His name is Sammy
I'm big brother Dean

05:50.050 --> 05:54.692
The perfect family
Or so it seemed

05:54.888 --> 05:58.028
The demon's visits had begun

05:58.225 --> 06:01.570
It believed Sam was the chosen one

06:01.761 --> 06:07.734
It burned my mother
And it cursed my brother

06:07.934 --> 06:12.246
Leaving us in tears

06:12.439 --> 06:15.249
On the road so far

06:15.709 --> 06:18.451
Yeah, the road so far

06:19.045 --> 06:20.752
We are in Dad's car

06:20.947 --> 06:24.087
Cut. All right,
go talk to the Lighting Department.

06:24.284 --> 06:27.595
- And I'm gonna go talk to Siobhan.
- Okay.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.601
- That was really, really good.
- What in the holyâ€œ?

06:31.791 --> 06:33.634
There is a case.

06:34.794 --> 06:37.741
- Probably has something to do with all this.
- You think?

06:37.931 --> 06:40.207
- ...a little more bounce in it, okay?
- Publisher?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.808
Yeah.

06:44.070 --> 06:48.212
- Maggie, Marie just never stops.
- I know. You were great.

06:48.408 --> 06:52.288
Oh, my gosh. Are you guys from the publisher?
I'm Marie, the writer-slash-director.

06:52.479 --> 06:56.052
This is Maeve, my stage manager.
And that was just a dress... Mm.

07:01.321 --> 07:05.098
I'm, uh, Special Agent Smith.
This is my partner, Special Agent...

07:05.292 --> 07:06.771
- Smith.
- ...Smith.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.633
No relation. Heh.

07:08.828 --> 07:12.833
- We're hereto look into the disappearance.
- There is no singing in Supernatural.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.074
Well, this is Marie's interpretation...

07:17.270 --> 07:18.340
Ha.

07:18.571 --> 07:23.486
Well, I mean, if there was singing,
you know... And that's a big "if."

07:24.344 --> 07:26.984
If there was singing,
it would be classic rock.

07:27.180 --> 07:30.650
Not this Andrew Floyd Webber crap.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.124
- Andrew Lloyd Webber.
- What?

07:32.319 --> 07:38.497
Well, you know, we do sing a cover of
"Carry On Wayward Son" in the second act.

07:38.692 --> 07:39.932
- Really?
- Oh.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.940
It's a classic.

07:43.663 --> 07:47.338
Right. Anyways, we're here to talk
about the disappearance of Mrs. Chandler.

07:47.534 --> 07:51.004
Any chance you two saw her
before she vanished?

07:51.204 --> 07:54.310
Yeah. She left around like, what, 9:30?

07:54.507 --> 07:56.783
Any idea where she would be headed
that time of night?

07:56.977 --> 08:01.221
A bar. Or a liquor store. Both.

08:02.182 --> 08:06.153
- Wow. Really?
- She had a nasty divorce last year.

08:06.353 --> 08:11.029
Most of the time, shes sipping
on her, uh, grown-up juice or passed out.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.637
- Usually in that order.
- Yeah, well, I don't blame her.

08:14.828 --> 08:18.366
I'm gonna need 50 Jell-O shots
and a hose-down to get this stink off me.

08:19.232 --> 08:23.044
- Maeve, right? You're the stage manager.
- And I understudy Jody Mills.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.375
- What?
- That's great. That's great.

08:25.572 --> 08:27.210
Jody Mills. That's great. Ahem.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.354
So how about you give me
a, uh, behind-the-scenes tour...

08:30.543 --> 08:33.683
...while your director shows my partner
Mrs. Chandler's office?

08:33.880 --> 08:38.351
- Deal? Great. Give us a moment, please.
- Okay.

08:41.421 --> 08:44.664
I mean, I
gotta say, it's kind of charming.

08:44.858 --> 08:48.931
The production value and the...
No? No. No. Ahem.

08:49.696 --> 08:53.371
I'm gonna check for EMF.
You... You look for, uh, cursed objects.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.674
I think we need to reposition.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.580
How'd you get all this stuff?

09:01.775 --> 09:04.381
Some parts homemade,
some parts repurposed.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.454
All of it awesome.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.023
Don't...

09:10.950 --> 09:12.691
Please don't.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.697
- What are they doing?
- Oh, uh...

09:18.892 --> 09:21.270
They're rehearsing the BM scene.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.905
- The bowel-movement scene?
- No.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.805
No, the boy-melodrama scene.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.942
You know,
the scene where the boys get together...

09:31.137 --> 09:33.743
...and they're driving
or leaning against Baby...

09:34.474 --> 09:37.648
...drinking a beer, sharing their feelings.

09:38.778 --> 09:42.954
The two of them, alone but together.

09:43.149 --> 09:46.289
Bonded. United. The power of their...

09:46.486 --> 09:48.830
Why are they standing so close together?

09:49.289 --> 09:50.632
Uh...

09:51.257 --> 09:52.327
Reasons.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.338
You know they're brothers, right?

09:56.930 --> 10:01.003
Well, duh. But subtext.

10:03.903 --> 10:06.907
Why don't you take
a substep back there, ladies?

10:16.149 --> 10:18.993
Now, have you noticed
anything strange during the production?

10:19.652 --> 10:21.256
I mean...

10:21.855 --> 10:23.163
...any odd noises or...?

10:23.356 --> 10:25.302
You mean something like this?

10:26.860 --> 10:28.305
Or perhaps this?

10:29.863 --> 10:31.604
- Right. Of course.
- How about this?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.141
I got it. Thanks.

10:35.768 --> 10:41.548
Heh. You know, back when I did tech
in school, we had two CD decks.

10:42.041 --> 10:45.386
Oh, sorry. I have to go
sign for a delivery.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.788
Please don't touch anything.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.002
Sorry.

11:22.081 --> 11:24.061
- This hers?
- No.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.254
That's a prop from act two.
I've been looking for that, actually.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.330
There's no space in Supernatural.

11:29.522 --> 11:33.493
Well, not canonically, no.
But this is transformative fiction.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.836
Oh. You mean fan fiction.

11:37.597 --> 11:43.172
Call it whatever you like, okay?
It's inspired by Carver Edlund's books.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.007
With a few embellishments.

11:46.105 --> 11:50.417
Well, as you know,
Chuck stopped writing after Swan Song.

11:50.610 --> 11:53.090
I just... I couldn't leave
it the way that it was.

11:53.279 --> 11:56.920
I mean, Dean not hunting anymore,
living with Lisa.

11:57.116 --> 12:00.791
Sam somehow back from hell
but not with Dean.

12:01.020 --> 12:04.024
So, um, I wrote my own ending.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.734
You wrote your own ending?
With spaceships?

12:07.927 --> 12:12.808
And robots. And some ninjas.
And then Dean becomes a woman.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.439
It's just for a few scenes.

12:18.438 --> 12:23.478
All right, Shakespeare, you know I can tell
you what really happened with Sam and Dean?

12:23.710 --> 12:29.456
A friend of mine hooked me up with the, uh,
unpublished unpublished books.

12:29.649 --> 12:33.062
So Sam came back from hell
but without his soul.

12:33.253 --> 12:37.633
Then Cass brought in a bunch
of leviathans from purgatory.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.804
Uh, they lost Bobby.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.132
And then Cass and Dean
got stuck in purgatory.

12:42.328 --> 12:43.807
Sam hit a dog.

12:43.997 --> 12:47.467
They met a prophet named Kevin.
They lost him too.

12:47.667 --> 12:51.240
Then Sam underwent a series of trials...

12:51.437 --> 12:54.907
...in an attempt to close
the gates of hell.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.645
Which nearly cost him his life.

12:57.844 --> 13:00.916
And Dean? Well, Dean became a demon.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.321
A knight of hell, actually.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.789
- Wow.
- Yup.

13:06.986 --> 13:12.197
That is some of the worst fan fiction
that I have ever heard.

13:12.825 --> 13:16.830
I mean, seriously, though,
where'd your friend find this garbage?

13:17.030 --> 13:20.637
I'm not saying that ours is a masterpiece
or anything, but jeez.

13:22.368 --> 13:25.872
- I'll have to send you some fic links later.
- What are they doing?

13:27.473 --> 13:29.146
Um...

13:29.342 --> 13:32.186
Kids these days call it hugging.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.187
- Is that in the show?
- Oh.

13:34.380 --> 13:37.384
No. Siobhan and Kristen
are a couple in real life.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.556
Although we do explore the nature
of Destiel in act two.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.730
- Sorry, what?
- Oh, it's just subtext.

13:46.359 --> 13:50.569
But then again, you know,
you can't spell subtext without...

13:50.797 --> 13:52.470
...S-E-X.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.549
- I don't understand.
- Me neither.

13:58.738 --> 14:01.582
I mean, shouldn't it be "Deastiel"?

14:01.808 --> 14:04.049
Really? That's your issue with this?

14:04.243 --> 14:06.382
No. Of course it's not my issue.

14:06.579 --> 14:10.186
You know, how about "Sastiel"? "Samstiel"?

14:10.383 --> 14:15.526
Okay, you know what? You're gonna do that thing
where you just shut the hell up forever.

14:16.322 --> 14:19.667
Uh, look, we had no EMF. No hex bags.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.430
None of their props are
even remotely hinky.

14:22.695 --> 14:28.008
Other than the Charlie Kaufman of it all,
I got nothing. You?

14:28.201 --> 14:31.580
Ms. Chandler's office was just a pile
of empty bottles and regret.

14:31.771 --> 14:34.877
She's probably facedown
in a bar somewhere or a ditch.

14:35.074 --> 14:39.386
All right, so, what, this whole musical
thing, everything, it's just-l?

14:39.579 --> 14:42.185
It's all a coincidence? There is no case?

14:42.682 --> 14:46.687
Unless you're seeing something I'm not,
no, Dean, there's no case here.

14:48.087 --> 14:49.191
Okay.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.233
- Casdean?
- Shut your face.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.930
Get in the car.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.549
Maggie, come on.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.415
Please don't do this.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.926
Everyone else is willing
to follow your little dictatorship.

15:19.118 --> 15:22.065
But not me.
I've been telling you all along, Marie.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.929
If it's not canon,
then it shouldn't be in the show.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.762
We should have just done
The Outsiders like I told you.

15:28.961 --> 15:31.737
Just come back inside.
We can make this work.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.844
I'm going to Principal Salazar's
in the morning.

15:36.068 --> 15:39.447
Gonna do what Mrs. Chandler
was too drunk to finish.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.246
Great.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.382
Maggie?

16:17.610 --> 16:19.021
Maggie!

16:40.032 --> 16:43.502
I understand. All right. Thank you for
the help, officer. Appreciate it.

16:46.038 --> 16:47.346
I checked with the principal.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.714
There's nothing on the surveillance tapes.
What do the cops think?

16:50.910 --> 16:53.516
You know, the only clue they found
was by the Dumpster.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.887
They found the same flower
near Mrs. Chandler's cell phone.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.255
- You recognize it?
- No.

16:58.484 --> 16:59.724
Yeah, me neither.

16:59.919 --> 17:01.762
Made you some tea.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.262
Hey.

17:06.492 --> 17:09.939
Let me guess. You guys came here
to laugh at me too, right?

17:11.696 --> 17:14.200
Why don't you tell us
what happened to your friend?

17:16.402 --> 17:17.608
Maggie quit the show.

17:18.604 --> 17:21.585
She was trying to get us shut down,
and so we were fighting.

17:22.174 --> 17:25.712
Then she left, and I heard her scream.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.050
So I ran outside to help.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.519
And...

17:31.951 --> 17:33.555
And I saw a scarecrow.

17:35.121 --> 17:38.796
It looked just like the one
from our show, but...

17:39.525 --> 17:40.560
...alive.

17:41.193 --> 17:42.263
Then what?

17:46.065 --> 17:49.308
It wrapped her up in vines
and took her behind a Dumpster.

17:49.535 --> 17:52.311
And then they were both just gone.

17:52.772 --> 17:58.814
So I called the cops, and a bunch of adults
just told me I had an overactive imagination.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.593
But it's all real.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.124
Ghosts. Angels.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.959
- Demons.
- I want to believe.

18:09.155 --> 18:11.601
You should believe. You both should.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.465
Because it is all real.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.271
And so are we.

18:17.463 --> 18:21.275
I'm Sam Winchester. That's Dean.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.782
Okay. Now, look. Ahem.

18:33.779 --> 18:37.420
I'm willing to accept
that monsters are real.

18:37.617 --> 18:41.531
But those books are works of fiction.

18:41.754 --> 18:44.792
And you guys are way too old
to be Sam or Dean.

18:44.991 --> 18:49.497
- Oh, yeah.
- More of a Rufus-Bobby combo. Maybe.

18:49.695 --> 18:52.005
Okay. All right.

18:52.198 --> 18:57.170
Little Miss Sunshine,
we are what the books call hunters.

18:57.370 --> 19:00.044
- FBI hunters?
- Yeah.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.310
You guys are X-Files.

19:05.344 --> 19:06.880
Sure. Yeah. You could say that.

19:07.546 --> 19:11.961
So this scarecrow in your musical,
is it based on the one from the books?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.357
No. I changed it.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.964
I got scared of a local legend
when I was a kid.

19:16.822 --> 19:21.464
There was this old creepy scarecrow
on an abandoned farm outside of town.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.835
Kids used to say if it caught you,
it would take you away.

19:25.031 --> 19:30.037
If this scarecrow was based off of your version,
Ms. Chandler and Maggie might still be alive.

19:30.536 --> 19:33.016
You think the scarecrow was created
by the play?

19:35.341 --> 19:39.346
You think it's a Tulpa.

19:40.012 --> 19:44.552
Tulpas are monsters that are created
by intense focused energy on an idea.

19:44.750 --> 19:47.390
- Yeah, or a story.
- Great. How do you kill an idea?

19:47.586 --> 19:49.031
Well, in Hell House...

19:49.221 --> 19:52.566
...Sam and Dean burned the house down
to take out the Tulpa they hunted.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.829
Yeah. You kill the symbol,
you kill the Tulpa.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.665
It's, uh, actually a pretty good start

19:56.862 --> 20:00.071
So the scarecrow in your play,
is it a person or a prop?

20:00.266 --> 20:03.247
Prop. And it's terrifying.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.509
We keep it in the boiler room.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.547
That's, uh, great. Um...

20:10.743 --> 20:14.054
Okay, you guys read up.
Just give us a second.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.355
So this doesn't add up.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.429
Tulpas require a ton of psychic energy
to juice up.

20:20.619 --> 20:22.758
- Yeah.
- It's not like the Supernatural books...

20:22.955 --> 20:25.595
mare tearing up
the New York Times best-seller list.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.930
I seriously doubt this
play is even sold out.

20:28.127 --> 20:31.267
- Hope not.
- But you know what? This flower.

20:31.464 --> 20:34.468
I know I've seen it in the lore somewhere.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.604
- There's gotta be a connection.
- You get on that.

20:37.803 --> 20:40.147
- I'm gonna take a shot at Burning Man.
- Yeah.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.250
Can you show me to the boiler room?

20:45.578 --> 20:46.613
Yeah.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.554
Sure.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.261
Gird your loins.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.928
It's horrifying.

21:15.341 --> 21:17.821
- Really?
- I know.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.148
Scary, right?

21:29.355 --> 21:30.959
You wanna pinata this asshat?

21:31.490 --> 21:34.869
"Asshat"? Nice. It's, uh, very Dean.

21:35.694 --> 21:38.197
No. He's all yours, Agent Smith.

21:48.674 --> 21:49.948
Thank you.

21:50.142 --> 21:53.988
- We came, we saw, we kicked...
- it's not a Tulpa.

21:54.180 --> 21:57.457
- What?
- It's not a Tulpa.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.494
Say it one more time
but just a little bit more Arnold.

22:00.686 --> 22:03.895
- "It's not a Tulpa."
- Dude, come on. It's Calliope.

22:04.390 --> 22:06.870
- Who?
- The goddess of epic poetry.

22:07.893 --> 22:09.998
- The muse.
- She's associated with this.

22:10.196 --> 22:12.506
The Borage or Starflower.
That's the picture.

22:12.698 --> 22:15.201
Wait, if this is a god thing,
whats with the scarecrow?

22:15.401 --> 22:19.406
According to the lore, Calliope manifests
creatures from the stories she's tuned into.

22:19.839 --> 22:24.083
So the scarecrow is still alive.

22:24.310 --> 22:27.052
- We burned my prop for nothing?
- That thing needed to burn.

22:27.546 --> 22:30.186
The only way to destroy the scarecrow
is to kill Calliope.

22:30.382 --> 22:33.386
Right. She uses these manifestations,
like the scarecrow...

22:33.586 --> 22:39.161
...to inspire the author and protect them
until their vision is realized.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.595
Then what?

22:42.661 --> 22:44.368
Then she eats the author.

22:46.398 --> 22:47.433
Okay, that's bad.

22:49.235 --> 22:51.772
Well, you get your wish.

22:52.004 --> 22:55.076
- Let's cancel the show.
- That's what the others did.

22:55.274 --> 22:58.517
They tried to shut you down,
and the scarecrow took them.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.555
Protected you and the show.

23:01.747 --> 23:04.887
So the scarecrow is the bogeyman.
We gotta take our shot with this, uh...

23:05.084 --> 23:06.119
- Calliope.
- ...Calliope.

23:06.352 --> 23:11.199
But she won't show herself
until your vision is realized.

23:12.558 --> 23:15.539
So, what are you saying?

23:17.863 --> 23:19.865
The show must go on.

23:45.624 --> 23:47.399
- Why don't I...?
- You guys rally Marie.

23:47.593 --> 23:51.473
I'm gonna grab some wooden stakes
from the trunk and do the blessing.

23:53.599 --> 23:56.079
Is Marie gonna get eaten?

23:56.268 --> 23:58.077
Not gonna happen.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.979
Soon as that curtain rises, we are gonna
be there to take out this Calliope.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.852
Hey. Hey.

24:05.644 --> 24:07.123
How you doing, champ?

24:10.516 --> 24:11.859
This...

24:12.084 --> 24:14.257
This is all my fault.

24:14.453 --> 24:17.662
If I hadn't written this dumb play,
none of this would have happened.

24:17.856 --> 24:20.132
Well, first of all, the play's not dumb.

24:20.326 --> 24:23.307
I thought you didn't believe
in this interpretation.

24:23.495 --> 24:25.372
Yeah, I don't.

24:25.597 --> 24:29.340
Like, at all. But you do, okay?

24:29.535 --> 24:32.379
And I need you to believe in it
with all you got...

24:33.205 --> 24:37.278
...so that we can kill Calliope
and we can save your friends.

24:40.045 --> 24:41.456
Can you do that?

24:42.815 --> 24:44.317
Yeah. You're right.

24:45.617 --> 24:49.497
If Sam and Dean were real,
they wouldn't back down from a fight.

24:50.356 --> 24:54.827
Especially my sweet, brave, selfless Sam.

24:55.861 --> 24:58.307
- There's nothing he can't do.
- No.

25:05.904 --> 25:07.645
Okay.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.979
Let's do this.

25:10.542 --> 25:12.385
I understudy Sam, so...

25:13.412 --> 25:16.825
I used this for my one-woman
Orphan Black show last year.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.927
But it's gonna have to work for Sam.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.226
Writer.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.668
Director.

25:29.661 --> 25:31.231
Actor.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.745
I'm gonna Barbra Streisand this bitch.

25:47.713 --> 25:50.387
Okay. Good.

25:50.916 --> 25:53.726
Good. Okay. Good.

25:55.621 --> 25:57.225
Perfect.

25:57.423 --> 25:58.925
All right, Samulet?

26:01.260 --> 26:02.432
The Samulet?

26:03.362 --> 26:06.775
That amulet is a symbol
of the Winchesters' brotherly love.

26:06.965 --> 26:08.035
I'm so excited.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.440
Okay, good. Good.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.383
Ahem. Hey.

26:14.039 --> 26:15.416
Yeah.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.277
Okay.

26:20.446 --> 26:23.325
Pretty good. Wait a second. Where's Chuck?

26:23.549 --> 26:25.927
H, I love him. I do.

26:26.118 --> 26:30.260
But, honestly, the whole "author inserting
themselves into the narrative" thing...

26:30.456 --> 26:32.265
...it's just not my favorite.

26:32.458 --> 26:34.438
I kind of hate the meta stories.

26:34.626 --> 26:36.435
Me too.

26:37.663 --> 26:38.937
All right, listen up, girls.

26:39.131 --> 26:42.135
Now, I know you're all here
because you love Supernatural.

26:42.334 --> 26:45.110
Actually, I was hoping we'd do Wicked.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.342
Yeah, that'd have been easier. Uh...

26:48.574 --> 26:53.853
I have expressed some differences of opinion
regarding this version of Supernatural.

26:54.079 --> 26:59.427
But tonight it is all about Marie's vision.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.360
This is Marie's Supernatural.

27:03.188 --> 27:07.762
So I want you to get out there, and I want
you to stand as close as she wants you to...

27:07.960 --> 27:12.636
...and I want you to put as much sub
into that text as you possibly can.

27:12.831 --> 27:18.372
There is no other road, no other way,
no day but today.

27:18.604 --> 27:22.108
- Did he just quote Rent?
- Not enough to get us in trouble.

27:22.307 --> 27:26.050
- You get out there and you kick it in the ass.
- All right. Bring it in.

27:27.312 --> 27:30.623
Ghostfacers.

27:36.488 --> 27:42.336
Good evening, everybody.
Welcome to our production of Supernatural.

27:42.528 --> 27:43.666
Not gonna lie.

27:43.862 --> 27:48.675
It might be a full-on Gallagher show
up in this piece. Heh.

27:49.568 --> 27:56.213
So those of you in the front rows may want to
use the ponchos we provided under your seats.

27:56.408 --> 27:59.218
You may, in fact, get wet on this ride.

28:00.345 --> 28:04.657
Um, I would... I would like to thank
the, uh, cast and the crew.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.831
- Okay. She's stalling. Let's do this.
- Copy that.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.227
Curtain, kids. It's show/time.

28:10.422 --> 28:13.142
I'd
like to thank the school board...

28:15.527 --> 28:19.532
Okay. Uh, and that concludes
our introduction for the night.

28:19.731 --> 28:25.044
So everybody just sit back,
relax and enjoy the show.

28:30.075 --> 28:31.247
Everyone in places.

28:34.346 --> 28:37.589
John and Mary, husband and wife

28:37.783 --> 28:40.389
Bringing home a brand-new life

28:40.586 --> 28:46.628
His name is Sammy
I'm big brother Dean

28:47.426 --> 28:52.068
The perfect family
Or so it seemed

28:52.264 --> 28:54.904
The demon's visits had begun

28:55.100 --> 28:58.547
- Ah!
- It believed Sam was the chosen one.

28:58.737 --> 29:04.813
It burned my mother
And it cursed my brother

29:05.410 --> 29:09.552
Leaving us in tears

29:09.748 --> 29:12.957
On the road so far

29:13.151 --> 29:16.223
Yeah, the road so far

29:16.421 --> 29:18.958
We are in Dad's car

29:19.625 --> 29:20.831
On the road

29:21.059 --> 29:22.402
Turn around!

29:22.594 --> 29:24.437
So far

29:24.963 --> 29:28.308
Dad was driven, no turning back

29:28.500 --> 29:31.310
He wouldn't stop without the payback

29:31.503 --> 29:37.852
He trained us both to
Track and hunt and kill

29:38.076 --> 29:42.354
He took away our own free will

29:42.581 --> 29:45.755
So that's where we are

29:45.951 --> 29:49.489
On the road so far

29:49.688 --> 29:56.105
Saving people
Hunting things

29:56.295 --> 30:02.041
Family business
Back in swing

30:02.267 --> 30:09.276
Driving down the road so far

30:10.108 --> 30:14.022
Ready in five, four, three, two, go.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.140
Agent Smith?

30:30.329 --> 30:32.536
- Where the hell are we?
- School's basement.

30:32.731 --> 30:35.143
Scarecrow brought us down here.

30:38.170 --> 30:42.346
- Yeah, I tried that days ago.
- So, what, we're stuck in here'?

30:42.541 --> 30:43.884
That's right.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.856
You're gonna miss the big show.

31:01.426 --> 31:03.599
Okay, so you can pop in tomorrow morning.

31:03.829 --> 31:06.070
Yes. I'll just...

31:08.033 --> 31:09.103
...wait here, then.

31:13.438 --> 31:16.078
- So, what do we do now?
- Just stick to the plan, okay?

31:16.274 --> 31:18.413
Keep singing
until the scarecrow comes for you.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.022
That's what I'll do

31:23.014 --> 31:26.552
I'll just wait here, then

31:27.586 --> 31:30.123
Wait for my cue

31:30.856 --> 31:35.566
I raised you from perdition
To be God's ammunition

31:35.761 --> 31:40.904
But now you need some rest
So I will do what's best

31:41.533 --> 31:45.276
And just wait here, then

31:46.071 --> 31:48.779
That's all I'll do

31:50.876 --> 31:53.789
I'll just wait here, then

31:55.280 --> 31:59.319
I'll wait for you

32:01.920 --> 32:05.959
I've consumed many authors, many stories.

32:06.491 --> 32:10.166
But tonight, soon as that curtain opened...

32:10.395 --> 32:13.672
...I knew something special
was brewing with this one.

32:14.266 --> 32:18.681
Maybe it's because
the story's actual inspiration's here.

32:18.904 --> 32:21.282
Mm. I don't know.

32:21.473 --> 32:24.977
I guess I'm just gonna have to kill you
and your brother to find out.

32:25.811 --> 32:28.485
Don't you have to wait
until the vision has been realized?

32:28.680 --> 32:33.959
Heh. Oh, gods. If I have to sit
through that second act one more time...

32:34.152 --> 32:39.124
There's robots and tentacles in space.
I can't even.

32:47.365 --> 32:52.144
A single man tear
Slips down his face

32:52.337 --> 32:56.808
He shows emotion
Without a trace

32:57.008 --> 33:01.115
He hides behind
A mask so strong

33:02.013 --> 33:06.792
Worried that he
Could be wrong

33:06.985 --> 33:11.297
I wish that he could see the way I see him

33:11.857 --> 33:15.862
The perfect brother
A man without sin

33:16.895 --> 33:21.537
'Cause underneath the manly sheen

33:21.733 --> 33:26.807
It is my brother
A boy named Dean

33:27.005 --> 33:31.249
A single man tear
A single man tear

33:31.476 --> 33:37.256
A single man tear
That's all we fear

33:46.157 --> 33:49.570
A single man tear
That's all I'll spare

33:49.761 --> 33:51.707
We're through the looking
glass here, people.

33:51.897 --> 33:54.400
Strike the Wendigo set.
Prep the priest costumes.

33:54.599 --> 33:57.671
And, Sarah, get our understudies
into hair and makeup.

33:57.869 --> 34:02.284
So why this story, huh?
Why, uh, Supernatural?

34:02.507 --> 34:06.353
Supernatural has everything.

34:07.445 --> 34:11.552
Life. Death. Resurrection. Redemption.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.920
- The stake.
- But above all...

34:15.120 --> 34:17.600
- Get it.
- ...family.

34:17.789 --> 34:20.735
All set to music
you can really tap your toe to.

34:20.926 --> 34:24.396
It isn't some meandering piece
of genre dreck.

34:24.596 --> 34:27.543
It's epic.

34:27.732 --> 34:31.578
But underneath this broken mask

34:33.038 --> 34:36.076
It is my father
With all his wrath

34:37.409 --> 34:38.888
And that...

34:39.077 --> 34:41.887
...well, that is my bag of tea.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.786
- Bag this.
- Ungh!

34:44.583 --> 34:47.393
My own man

34:47.585 --> 34:51.329
But underneath this broken mask

34:52.223 --> 34:55.431
It is my father
With all his wrath

34:56.761 --> 35:01.835
A single man tear
A single man tear

35:03.168 --> 35:04.738
No chick-flick moment.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.002
Take a bow, Sammy.

36:19.010 --> 36:22.048
Usually this is where Sam and Dean take off
before anyone asks questions.

36:22.247 --> 36:23.658
That's probably a good idea.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.055
- Thanks for saving my friends.
- Sure.

36:26.251 --> 36:29.926
You know, if you cut your hair a little,
you'd make a pretty good Dean.

36:32.991 --> 36:35.699
- Thanks.
- Well, you did good out there, kid.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.931
You're not so bad yourself.

36:38.530 --> 36:41.568
You know, this has been educational.

36:42.167 --> 36:46.411
Seeing the story from your perspective.

36:46.604 --> 36:48.743
You keep writing, Shakespeare.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.886
Even if it doesn't match how you see it?

36:51.710 --> 36:53.519
I have my version, and you have yours.

36:56.281 --> 36:59.387
- One minute, folks. One minute.
- Okay.

36:59.584 --> 37:01.257
Dean?

37:04.422 --> 37:07.266
You never should have thrown this away.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.275
It never really worked.

37:15.467 --> 37:18.937
I don't need a symbol to remind me
how I feel about my brother. So...

37:19.137 --> 37:21.583
Just take it, jerk.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.775
Bitch.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.619
- Right. Okay.
- Sound car start.

37:33.451 --> 37:35.158
Stand by.

37:37.555 --> 37:38.659
Curtain go.

37:42.660 --> 37:46.130
I guess we can go back
to staring at motel-room walls.

37:46.664 --> 37:49.941
You know what, Dean? You were right.

37:50.135 --> 37:53.446
Staying cooped up isn't helping us.

37:53.638 --> 37:55.982
- We need...
- We need to be back on the road, Dean...

37:56.174 --> 37:58.313
...doing what we do best.

37:59.644 --> 38:01.146
What is that?

38:01.346 --> 38:04.327
- I don't know anymore.
- It's the, uh, BM scene.

38:04.516 --> 38:07.963
- Saving people. Hunting things.
- The bowel-movement scene?

38:08.153 --> 38:11.862
- You know, the family business.
shh.

38:12.090 --> 38:15.867
You're right, Sammy. Out on the road.

38:16.361 --> 38:17.840
Just the two of us.

38:18.363 --> 38:21.207
The two of us against the world.

38:22.934 --> 38:25.005
What she said.

38:30.375 --> 38:35.848
Carry on my wayward son

38:36.047 --> 38:40.689
There?! be peace when you are done

38:41.553 --> 38:47.003
Lay your weary head to rest

38:47.192 --> 38:52.232
Don't you cry no more

38:55.533 --> 39:00.573
Once I rose above the noise and confusion

39:01.172 --> 39:07.418
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion

39:08.146 --> 39:09.591
Who's that'?

39:09.814 --> 39:12.260
Oh, that's Adam,
John Winchester's other kid.

39:12.483 --> 39:16.590
He's still trapped in a cage in hell
with Lucifer.

39:17.922 --> 39:22.769
Masquerading as a man with a reason

39:23.528 --> 39:28.773
My charade is the event of the season

39:29.000 --> 39:33.449
And if I claim to be a wise man

39:34.405 --> 39:39.616
It surely means I don't know

39:40.278 --> 39:45.125
Carry on my wayward son

39:45.884 --> 39:50.128
There?! be peace when you are done

39:51.289 --> 39:56.295
Lay your weary head to rest

39:57.295 --> 40:02.438
Don't you cry no more

40:02.634 --> 40:05.979
Carry on

40:42.340 --> 40:44.684
Thanks so much for coming.

40:46.611 --> 40:48.955
Oh, bye. Sorry. Thank you. Thank you.

40:49.147 --> 40:52.754
The ticket you left for the publisher.
Someone claimed it.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.521
Oh, my gosh.

40:56.354 --> 41:00.166
But wait, does that mean
that Calliope came for me or for...?

41:00.358 --> 41:02.099
Who cares? Go, fan girl.

41:06.297 --> 41:11.770
Um, hi.
Thank you so much for coming. Uh...

41:11.970 --> 41:16.043
I know the second act is a little bit
wonky, and the first act has some issues...

41:16.274 --> 41:19.380
...but what did you think?

41:25.350 --> 41:26.988
Not bad.
