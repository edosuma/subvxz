01:05.467 --> 01:07.333
Ma, where are you going
with all that food?

01:07.400 --> 01:11.233
I'm stashing it away from Rose's
mother. She's on a special diet.

01:11.300 --> 01:14.000
I hate those people.
You turn your back for a second,

01:14.066 --> 01:16.767
boom-boom, your food is gone.

01:16.834 --> 01:19.300
Anything on your plate
is suddenly on their diet.

01:19.367 --> 01:23.133
Oh, come on, Ma. You haven't
even met Rose's mother.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.266
I know a lot of old people. They're
all the same. They're cranky,

01:26.333 --> 01:28.700
they're demanding,
they repeat themselves,

01:28.767 --> 01:31.400
they're cranky,
they're demanding...

01:33.066 --> 01:34.834
Ma, what makes you think
she's old?

01:34.900 --> 01:36.633
She's the same age as you.

01:36.700 --> 01:39.633
So how come she ordered her
a wheelchair at the airport,

01:39.700 --> 01:43.433
a special meal on the plane, and
put an oxygen tank in the garage?

01:43.500 --> 01:46.700
Maybe she's a disabled welder
on a special diet.

01:48.367 --> 01:50.300
Listen, Ma,
I want you to be nice to her.

01:50.367 --> 01:52.533
Maybe you can even show her
some of the sights.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.767
-(door opens)
-That must be them.

01:54.834 --> 01:56.800
Well, thanks again
for the ride home, Dirk.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.667
I'll see you at Tuesday's
jazzercise class?

01:58.734 --> 01:59.867
-I'll see you then.
-Ok.

01:59.934 --> 02:01.433
Unless I see you before then.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.967
I mean, if you wouldn't mind,
maybe we could go out.

02:04.033 --> 02:07.433
Why, Dirk, did I just hear you
ask me for a date?

02:07.500 --> 02:09.266
Are you deaf?
I heard him from here.

02:11.533 --> 02:14.934
So, Blanche, you think maybe
we could have dinner Saturday night?

02:15.000 --> 02:18.166
Well, why don't I just check
my date book, and I'll let you know.

02:18.233 --> 02:21.033
-Sure. I'll call you tomorrow.
-Ok. Bye.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.033
Bye.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.600
Well, isn't this
an interesting turn of events?

02:27.667 --> 02:29.934
Gosh, I just don't know
what I'm gonna do.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.233
You know, he is a little bit
younger than I am.

02:35.266 --> 02:38.600
Watch your step, mother.
That's a girl!

02:38.667 --> 02:43.066
Oh, Rosie,
I haven't been a girl since 1912.

02:43.567 --> 02:45.400
Why, look who's here!

02:45.467 --> 02:48.934
I want you all to meet
my mother, Mrs. Lindstrom.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.033
(loudly) This is Blanche
and this is Dorothy and Sophia.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.300
(loudly)
Very nice to meet you.

02:56.367 --> 02:58.066
Tell me, how was your trip?

02:58.133 --> 03:00.266
(loudly) It was just fine.

03:01.900 --> 03:03.867
Which one of them
is hard of hearing?

03:04.633 --> 03:05.767
Oh, no one is, mother.

03:05.834 --> 03:08.467
We just didn't want you
to have to strain to hear us.

03:08.533 --> 03:10.633
But there's nothing wrong
with my ears.

03:10.700 --> 03:12.367
Of course, there isn't.

03:12.433 --> 03:16.800
Now you sit right down here,
and I'll fix you a little snack.

03:16.867 --> 03:19.734
Well, how long will you be visiting
with us, Mrs. Lindstrom?

03:19.800 --> 03:23.333
Oh, only a week. Then she's off
to Houston to see my brother.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.266
Is your name Mrs. Lindstrom?

03:26.567 --> 03:29.066
Mrs. Lindstrom, how would you
like a little tour of our home

03:29.133 --> 03:30.667
while Rose is fixing that snack?

03:30.734 --> 03:33.033
Oh, I don't think this is a
good time for that, Blanche.

03:33.100 --> 03:35.800
Mother's had a big day, and
I don't want her to get overtired.

03:35.867 --> 03:38.767
Well, she can skip
the east wing, Rose.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.867
Well, maybe tomorrow.
Now, come on.

03:42.934 --> 03:45.767
Why don't you take a little nap
while I fix you something to eat.

03:45.834 --> 03:49.600
Rosie! I'm not a child.
I don't need a nap.

03:49.667 --> 03:52.200
Well, there's nothing wrong
with taking a nap.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.133
Bob Hope takes naps.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.100
Unless he's in the bedroom
now taking one,

03:56.166 --> 03:58.000
I think she'd rather stay here
with us.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.800
Sophia, please.
I know what's best for my mother.

04:01.867 --> 04:05.233
Come on, honey. Let's get you
unpacked. Right down there.

04:06.166 --> 04:07.834
Seems like a very nice lady.

04:07.900 --> 04:10.700
Yeah. Too bad Rose
won't get off her back.

04:10.767 --> 04:12.266
You know what I think?

04:12.333 --> 04:14.300
I think I can handle
this relationship with Dirk.

04:14.367 --> 04:15.900
I'm going out with him
Saturday night.

04:15.967 --> 04:18.266
Was there ever any doubt?

04:18.767 --> 04:20.100
Momentarily.

04:20.166 --> 04:22.233
This is strictly off the record,
but...

04:22.300 --> 04:24.433
Dirk's nearly five years
younger than I am.

04:28.700 --> 04:31.266
In what, Blanche, dog years?

04:40.800 --> 04:44.633
However, I have decided
to overlook that minor detail

04:44.700 --> 04:46.667
and succumb
to the Vesuvius of passion

04:46.734 --> 04:48.500
that is about to erupt from me.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.967
Stand back. We're gonna
get something on us.

04:53.834 --> 04:56.567
I am talking about what's
happening between Dirk and me.

04:56.633 --> 05:00.700
It's something really special,
something fragile and rare.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.266
I've only felt this once before.

05:05.233 --> 05:07.266
It was during my 17th summer,

05:07.333 --> 05:09.300
and I was working behind
the cosmetics counter

05:09.367 --> 05:11.200
at the Rexall drugstore.

05:11.266 --> 05:13.133
I was stocking
the Maybelline display

05:13.200 --> 05:16.333
when I heard
this booming voice say,

05:16.400 --> 05:19.300
"excuse me, ma'am.
Where are the cuticle scissors?"

05:22.800 --> 05:24.667
I turned around,
and there he was.

05:24.734 --> 05:27.734
Our eyes locked,
and for one brief moment,

05:27.800 --> 05:29.900
there was nobody else on earth
but the two of us.

05:29.967 --> 05:33.133
Please, Blanche. Sidney
Sheldon tells shorter stories!

05:34.633 --> 05:37.800
I know in my heart,
if I'd just followed my feelings

05:37.867 --> 05:41.533
that day at the Rexall drugstore,
today I would be Mrs. Andy Griffith!

05:43.834 --> 05:46.333
I tell you what, I'm not gonna make
the same mistake with Dirk

05:46.400 --> 05:47.700
that I made with Andy.

05:51.233 --> 05:53.233
Didn't she tell us
that story before?

05:53.300 --> 05:56.934
Yes, but the last time it was
Woolworth's, a toenail clipper,

05:57.000 --> 05:58.867
and John Cameron Swayze.

06:06.233 --> 06:10.066
(woman on tv) <i>Inhale. Good!</i>

06:10.633 --> 06:13.033
<i>Exhale and lean back.</i>

06:13.767 --> 06:16.400
<i>Hold your position. Keep breathing.</i>

06:16.467 --> 06:18.867
(panting)

06:18.934 --> 06:22.266
The only time I get in that position
is when I give birth.

06:25.033 --> 06:26.266
Oh!

06:29.233 --> 06:31.266
-My back.
-Are you all right?

06:31.333 --> 06:33.800
No, but it's worth it.

06:33.867 --> 06:37.033
No pain, no gain.
Got to look good for Dirk.

06:37.100 --> 06:39.900
A man his age is used
to a trim body with good tone.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.867
Then buy him a princess phone.

06:45.166 --> 06:46.400
What are you doing now?

06:46.467 --> 06:49.000
I'm taking my bee pollen
and my sheep's liver extract

06:49.066 --> 06:50.567
and my fish oil protein.

06:50.633 --> 06:52.367
I'm getting younger
with each passing day.

06:52.433 --> 06:54.867
Great, great.
When they defrost walt Disney,

06:54.934 --> 06:57.266
he'll have someone to go out with.

06:59.934 --> 07:02.266
Go ahead, make fun.
These treatments are working.

07:02.333 --> 07:05.133
Oh, come on, Blanche.
Now think about it for a minute.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.233
If you feel you have
to go through all of this,

07:07.300 --> 07:09.800
then what kind of a relationship
can this possibly be?

07:09.867 --> 07:14.333
A youthful relationship.
A relationship that I want.

07:15.033 --> 07:17.600
Dorothy, Dirk is the youngest
man I've ever dated.

07:17.667 --> 07:20.467
If I'm gonna keep him,
I've got to give it all I got.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.333
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got some road work to do.

07:25.166 --> 07:27.867
-Hi, Blanche. You look terrific.
-Thanks!

07:27.934 --> 07:29.934
Blanche looks terrible.

07:33.533 --> 07:36.700
She looks terrible because
all she eats is bee pollen.

07:36.767 --> 07:42.233
I know! Isn't it ironic
that the bees look so good?

07:44.200 --> 07:45.767
Rose, what are you doing home?

07:45.834 --> 07:47.266
I came home early
to be with mother.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.433
No, my mother took her
to the track.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.600
You let her out of the house?

07:51.667 --> 07:55.300
No, she dug a tunnel out of her
bedroom with a dessert spoon.

07:55.367 --> 07:58.533
Oh, my lord! She's out on
the street and it's almost dark.

07:58.600 --> 08:01.500
Honey, she's fine.
She's with my mother.

08:01.567 --> 08:03.934
Oh, Sophia's different, Dorothy.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.567
She's... she's...

08:06.300 --> 08:07.867
she's your mother.

08:07.934 --> 08:09.900
My mother's led a very quiet life.

08:09.967 --> 08:12.233
All this is gonna be
too much for her.

08:12.300 --> 08:14.467
Come on, honey.
She's out betting on the horses,

08:14.533 --> 08:16.100
not rounding them up.

08:17.834 --> 08:20.400
(Sophia) Hello?! Anyone home?!

08:20.900 --> 08:22.800
Oh, mother, are you all right?

08:22.867 --> 08:25.367
She's fine.
I'm 50 bucks in the hole.

08:27.667 --> 08:31.467
Look, Rose!
I won $400.

08:31.533 --> 08:35.133
-I told you she was all right.
-Congratulations, Alma.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.400
Mom, I'll be in the living room...

08:37.467 --> 08:41.667
in case you decide to explain where
you got the $50 that you just lost.

08:42.800 --> 08:46.200
Sophia,
what time does that mall close?

08:46.266 --> 08:48.266
I feel like getting wild.

08:48.333 --> 08:50.967
I'll buy you some
of that bikini underwear.

08:51.033 --> 08:52.767
Nah, it rides up on me.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.266
Mother, you've had
quite enough for one day.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.700
Now, you sit right down there, and
I'll bring you a nice cup of tea.

09:01.767 --> 09:05.600
I don't want a cup of tea,
I want to go out and have fun!

09:05.667 --> 09:08.500
Mother, you know how you get
when you get tired.

09:08.567 --> 09:10.967
You're liable to lose your
balance and break a hip.

09:11.033 --> 09:12.900
That's exactly how
it happened the last time.

09:12.967 --> 09:17.066
Rosie, I broke my hip ice skating!

09:18.000 --> 09:19.533
Do you want to go back
to the hospital?

09:19.600 --> 09:21.367
Did you have fun the last time?

09:21.433 --> 09:24.433
I had more fun than I'm having
here with you.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.567
Mother!

09:25.633 --> 09:30.233
Stop mothering me.
You make me sorry I came!

09:40.133 --> 09:43.500
Come on, Rose. You just checked
the door two minutes ago.

09:43.567 --> 09:45.233
I thought I heard something.

09:46.734 --> 09:48.567
I should never have
let them go shopping.

09:48.633 --> 09:50.900
-It's too dangerous.
-Oh, what are you talking about?

09:50.967 --> 09:54.433
Just this morning,
I read where 1,400 people

09:54.500 --> 09:57.300
were injured in a food riot
in Calcutta.

10:00.834 --> 10:04.734
Oh, Sophia, thank goodness
you're home. Where's mother?

10:04.800 --> 10:08.166
She was feeling lucky, so she
wanted to try her hand at Jai-Alai.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.633
-Well, why didn't you go with her?
-I'm too short to play Jai-Lai.

10:12.734 --> 10:17.800
Sophia, you left my mother alone,
roaming through a strange city?

10:17.867 --> 10:20.734
Who's roaming?
She has a bus map, $400

10:20.800 --> 10:22.567
and a Spanish/English dictionary.

10:23.600 --> 10:28.166
I can't believe my mother's out
riding around on a smelly old bus,

10:28.233 --> 10:30.600
being pushed around, harassed,

10:30.667 --> 10:35.266
possibly even mugged by hostile
teenagers with bad haircuts.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.333
Rose, you are overreacting.
Come on now.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.166
Your mother
is not a helpless little girl.

10:39.233 --> 10:42.633
She is an active, vital woman
who can take care of herself.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.600
-(phone rings)
-I'll get that.

10:45.967 --> 10:48.734
Hello? Yes, this is she.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.500
Oh, my Lord!

10:51.567 --> 10:53.033
-Rose, what is it?
-Yes, I understand.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.066
I'll be right down.

10:54.133 --> 10:55.633
-Rose, what's wrong?
-That was the police.

10:55.700 --> 10:58.233
What? What's the matter?
Is it your mother? Is she all right?

10:58.300 --> 11:00.667
She's fine.
She's at the police station.

11:00.734 --> 11:03.100
They picked up my vital,
active mother.

11:03.166 --> 11:05.800
She was lost and disoriented.
What do you say to that?

11:05.867 --> 11:08.100
Oh, come on now. Calm down,
Rose. I have to go.

11:08.166 --> 11:09.734
-I'm gonna go with you.
-No, thanks.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.567
You've been
quite enough help already.

11:13.166 --> 11:15.233
Well, I hope Alma's all right.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.100
Don't worry about Alma.
She's a tough old broad.

11:19.934 --> 11:22.033
Dorothy, look at me.

11:23.033 --> 11:25.200
I have turned back
the hands of time.

11:27.867 --> 11:30.633
Since Dirk asked me out,
I've dropped ten years.

11:30.700 --> 11:33.700
Why, my face is smooth,
my body is taut,

11:33.767 --> 11:35.333
and my gears are grinding.

11:36.467 --> 11:39.166
Blanche, no matter what you
do to your face, your body,

11:39.233 --> 11:41.433
or your gears,
you are still your age.

11:41.500 --> 11:45.033
Of course, you are.
Gravity always takes its toll.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.633
Look at me. I used to be
a tall voluptuous blonde

11:47.700 --> 11:49.233
with a butt like granite.

11:52.633 --> 11:55.700
When Dirk looks at me,
you think he sees an old woman?

11:55.767 --> 12:00.166
No, he sees a young, vibrant,
passionate contemporary.

12:00.233 --> 12:02.834
Blanche, you haven't even
been out with him yet.

12:02.900 --> 12:06.533
Oh, but my instincts are infallible
in this. Believe me, I know men.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.233
-No arguments here.
-(doorbell rings)

12:09.300 --> 12:11.867
A husband like Dirk could keep
me young another 20 years.

12:11.934 --> 12:13.433
Or kill ya.

12:16.734 --> 12:18.000
You look gorgeous.

12:18.066 --> 12:20.300
-Oh, well, really?
-Yeah.

12:20.367 --> 12:22.900
Goodness, I didn't even have
time to put on my makeup.

12:27.433 --> 12:29.400
Would you mind waiting
out in the van, Dirk?

12:29.467 --> 12:31.533
-I'll be with you in just a minute.
-Sure.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.266
I do believe the man
said "gorgeous."

12:35.333 --> 12:36.600
I'm gonna live forever!

12:36.667 --> 12:38.633
Not outside of an institution.

12:49.467 --> 12:50.900
You almost finished?

12:50.967 --> 12:53.500
Yeah, but I don't want to come out.

12:53.567 --> 12:56.500
This is the only peace
and quiet I've had in two days.

12:57.367 --> 12:58.767
Blanche thinks she's peter pan,

12:58.834 --> 13:01.100
and Rose is turning
into Mommie Dearest.

13:02.567 --> 13:05.567
That's nothing. You think
you're Josephine the plumber!

13:05.633 --> 13:09.734
-Well, ma, I saved us at least $50.
-Good.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.300
Between that and what I lost
at the track, you're even.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.867
-(door slams)
-(Rose) Mother, please!

13:14.934 --> 13:18.867
I told you, Rose.
They had no right to take me in!

13:18.934 --> 13:22.100
I merely flagged a policeman
to ask for directions,

13:22.166 --> 13:25.500
and before I knew it, he
dragged me to the police station.

13:25.567 --> 13:27.467
He was only trying
to help you, mother.

13:27.533 --> 13:31.633
And you had the gall
to scold me like a child

13:31.700 --> 13:33.066
in front of all those people!

13:33.133 --> 13:35.734
Well, there's no point in trying to
talk to you when you feel like this.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.133
After a good night's sleep,
you won't be so testy.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.500
-We'll discuss this in the morning.
-I won't be here in the morning.

13:41.567 --> 13:45.033
-What?
-I'm leaving early for Houston.

13:45.100 --> 13:48.333
I'll certainly have a much better
time at your brother's.

13:49.300 --> 13:50.834
I'm gonna help her pack.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.734
Then I'll see if I can win
some of that 400 from her

13:54.800 --> 13:56.100
before she leaves.

13:57.300 --> 14:00.133
Oh, Rose, honey.
Come on, she's just angry.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.367
I'm sure she didn't mean it.

14:02.433 --> 14:06.033
How can she talk to me like that?
I'm only trying to take care of her.

14:06.100 --> 14:09.433
Honey, can I talk to you
as one daughter to another?

14:09.500 --> 14:12.400
Do you remember way back
when we were teenagers?

14:12.467 --> 14:16.500
What was the one thing that
we wanted most from our mothers?

14:18.200 --> 14:19.333
A training bra?

14:22.066 --> 14:26.100
Honey, the thing we wanted most
was to be treated as adults.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.633
But then as we get older,
we turn right around

14:28.700 --> 14:32.500
and start treating our mothers
like little girls.

14:32.567 --> 14:35.700
Honey, all your mother wants
to do is be treated like a woman.

14:35.767 --> 14:38.033
Is that asking too much? Hmm?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.066
I got a jack!

14:46.433 --> 14:48.166
You got a queen.

14:48.233 --> 14:50.467
Ok, I owe you 40 bucks.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.233
Sophia, could you excuse us?

14:54.300 --> 14:56.967
If I've got to go now,
I don't owe you anything.

14:57.033 --> 14:59.233
-Who says?
-House rules.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.367
Ok.

15:06.300 --> 15:09.500
Mother, am I really
making you miserable?

15:10.300 --> 15:11.533
Yes, you are.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.266
I know you don't mean to,
but you are.

15:14.333 --> 15:16.100
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

15:17.400 --> 15:19.567
won't you stay
and give me another chance?

15:19.633 --> 15:21.767
I don't know, Rosie.

15:21.834 --> 15:27.033
I know I drive you crazy, but it's
just because I love you so much.

15:28.333 --> 15:32.834
You know, after daddy died, I just
thought I'd never get over it.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.600
And Charlie...

15:35.000 --> 15:38.066
well, there's not a day goes by
that I don't think about him.

15:39.767 --> 15:41.200
And now that...

15:42.367 --> 15:43.900
you're getting older...

15:45.367 --> 15:47.567
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose you, too.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.800
That's why I fuss over you so much.

15:59.900 --> 16:01.900
I understand, Rosie...

16:03.400 --> 16:05.600
but stopping me from living...

16:06.600 --> 16:09.400
isn't going to stop me from dying.

16:09.467 --> 16:11.200
Oh, I can't stand
to think about it.

16:11.266 --> 16:12.834
Well, then, don't.

16:15.266 --> 16:18.700
Let's just enjoy what we have.

16:27.433 --> 16:30.000
Easy, easy.
Ma, that's my best china.

16:31.500 --> 16:34.700
You got it for me when
I got married, you remember?

16:34.767 --> 16:37.600
Who could forget? I carried it
all the way from Sicily!

16:39.333 --> 16:41.800
And for what?
So you could get divorced.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.767
I should have gotten you something
returnable, like a donkey.

16:46.767 --> 16:50.967
You know, I've eaten through a lot
of great times on these plates.

16:51.033 --> 16:53.900
Yeah. You know, with Alma here,

16:53.967 --> 16:55.934
I've been thinking a lot about the
two of us.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.266
Oh, what do you mean?

16:57.333 --> 17:00.767
The one thing you never do
is treat me like an old lady.

17:01.433 --> 17:03.066
You treat me like a person.

17:04.033 --> 17:05.367
I appreciate that.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.734
You're a good daughter,
Dorothy.

17:09.700 --> 17:12.700
Ma, I'm overwhelmed.
I don't know what to say.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.133
I'll tell you
what you could say.

17:16.967 --> 17:19.233
You could say
I don't owe you the $50.

17:22.967 --> 17:27.433
Ma, you are a crazy lady,
and I love ya, I love ya, I love ya.

17:28.867 --> 17:30.767
I love you too, pussycat.

17:40.433 --> 17:42.934
Yes, I believe
I will have the escargot

17:43.000 --> 17:45.233
and the duck a l'orange

17:45.300 --> 17:48.133
and a nice tossed salad
with the bleu cheese dressing.

17:49.467 --> 17:52.567
I'll have the watercress salad
with two lemon wedges, please.

17:52.633 --> 17:54.834
Oh, that sounds great.

17:54.900 --> 17:57.066
I didn't even see that
on my menu.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.667
I'll have the same thing.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.467
-Isn't this a lovely place?
-Mm-hmm.

18:06.533 --> 18:09.266
It's one of my favorite restaurants.

18:09.333 --> 18:11.300
I'm into macrobiotics,
myself.

18:12.467 --> 18:13.467
I am too.

18:14.700 --> 18:16.433
I just like this atmosphere.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.867
So, what did you do before
you got into teaching aerobics?

18:22.934 --> 18:25.500
-I worked in a museum.
-You're kidding me.

18:25.567 --> 18:28.233
I work at a museum.
I love art.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.433
Me too! I love lifting it.

18:30.934 --> 18:32.533
I beg your pardon?

18:32.600 --> 18:35.200
I used to unload the trucks,
and I don't know why,

18:35.266 --> 18:40.100
but lifting those statues really
helped develop my deltoids. See?

18:40.166 --> 18:42.800
Yes, that's fascinating.
Put that down, honey.

18:48.734 --> 18:52.100
-Read any good books lately?
<i>-Pumping iron.</i>

18:52.166 --> 18:55.133
I saw the movie too, but I don't
think it did the book justice.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.467
How could it?

19:02.333 --> 19:04.233
I really like being with you.

19:04.734 --> 19:06.700
Well, thank you, Dirk.

19:06.767 --> 19:10.066
I like the way you sound
and the way you look.

19:10.133 --> 19:11.600
Well, thank you, Dirk.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.600
You remind me of my mother.

19:14.567 --> 19:17.867
She lives in Seattle, and I haven't
seen her for about three years.

19:17.934 --> 19:22.567
But when I'm with you, I kind
of feel like I'm home... with mom.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.333
Waiter!

19:34.767 --> 19:36.266
86 the watercress.

19:36.333 --> 19:39.333
I'll have the orange duck and
a double Jack Daniel's on the rocks.

19:47.900 --> 19:50.200
Come on,
one more hand.

19:50.266 --> 19:53.600
I'm tired, Sophia.
I'd like to cash in.

19:54.100 --> 19:57.200
Now, let's see,
these are worth a dollar apiece.

19:57.266 --> 20:01.367
I have 20 to 30 pretzel sticks here.

20:07.567 --> 20:09.300
Now you got pretzel dust.

20:11.367 --> 20:15.066
Come on, ma, don't be a sore loser.
Now, you owe her $30.

20:15.133 --> 20:18.033
You're absolutely right,
Dorothy. I stand corrected.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.633
Pay her.

20:21.166 --> 20:23.800
Gee, it's getting late. I wonder
how Blanche's date is going.

20:23.867 --> 20:25.533
Yeah, I'm getting a little worried.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.233
Me too. I don't feel comfortable
with her dating a younger man.

20:29.300 --> 20:31.633
Oh, I'm not concerned
about her dating a younger man.

20:31.700 --> 20:34.600
It's just that her expectations
are so high.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.333
You mean you approve?

20:36.400 --> 20:40.100
Well, why not? I mean,
what's so terrible? I did it once.

20:40.166 --> 20:43.300
You? You dated a younger man?

20:43.367 --> 20:46.467
Yes, Rose. Of course, it was
before I had the hump on my back.

20:54.667 --> 20:58.800
Personally, I don't see anything
wrong with dating a younger man.

20:58.867 --> 21:02.533
The three years I had with Ben were
some of the happiest of my life.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.767
Mother!

21:03.834 --> 21:06.333
Well, after daddy died
and you kids moved out,

21:06.400 --> 21:09.400
there was just no way I could
handle the place by myself.

21:09.467 --> 21:11.700
So I hired a farmhand.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.166
He was such a nice young man.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.900
He raved about my cooking.

21:16.967 --> 21:19.767
I guess they didn't feed him
very well in prison.

21:23.166 --> 21:27.834
Anyway, we just loved
being with each other.

21:27.900 --> 21:31.166
Of course, it was a particularly
lonely time for me,

21:31.233 --> 21:33.667
and it was nice to have
someone to talk to.

21:35.233 --> 21:38.800
And after a while, he moved in.

21:40.734 --> 21:44.700
I don't think I could have gotten
through those years without Ben.

21:44.767 --> 21:48.100
But when it was over, it was over.

21:49.100 --> 21:53.567
But we were both better off
for having known each other.

21:53.633 --> 21:56.767
Mother, how could you?

21:56.834 --> 21:59.200
A drifter? An ex-con?

22:00.900 --> 22:03.367
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

22:04.333 --> 22:06.867
you said he made you happy.
That's what matters.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.100
Yeah, he was probably very nice
for a drifting ex-con.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.000
Thank you, Rosie.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.166
I think I will go to bed now.

22:19.233 --> 22:20.633
-Good night.
-Good night, Alma.

22:20.700 --> 22:23.467
Wait, I'll go with ya.
I'll bring the cards.

22:23.533 --> 22:26.233
Can I ask you
a personal question, Alma?

22:26.300 --> 22:28.467
Did this Ben teach you
how to gamble?

22:28.967 --> 22:31.633
He taught me how to play cards

22:31.700 --> 22:34.667
and how to carve a pistol
out of soap.

22:41.400 --> 22:44.066
Do you think our kids are gonna want
us around when we're their age?

22:44.133 --> 22:46.734
Oh, Rose.
They don't want us now.

22:49.300 --> 22:51.467
Oh, I don't want
to talk about it.

22:51.533 --> 22:53.700
Wait a minute. What's the matter?
What happened?

22:53.767 --> 22:56.734
Oh, my date with Dirk
was a disaster.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.967
He was looking for a mother,
not a lover.

22:59.033 --> 23:01.166
It was humiliating.

23:01.233 --> 23:02.667
I think it's sweet.

23:02.734 --> 23:04.400
You would, Betty Crocker.

23:06.633 --> 23:09.000
Oh, I'm sorry, Rose.

23:09.066 --> 23:12.433
I'm just...
a little depressed.

23:12.500 --> 23:16.200
For the first time in my life,
I feel over 40.

23:16.266 --> 23:18.367
-You know why that is, honey?
-Why?

23:18.433 --> 23:19.934
Because you're over 50.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.900
Don't I know it.
Over 50 and over the hill!

23:27.967 --> 23:31.633
Oh, come on, Blanche.
Age is just a state of mind.

23:31.700 --> 23:33.500
Tell that to my thighs.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.800
Oh, I just feel awful.
I don't want to go on.

23:36.867 --> 23:38.834
No, I can't stand it!
I cannot stand it!

23:38.900 --> 23:42.133
Well, I can't, either! Listen,
you have your looks, your health.

23:42.200 --> 23:45.100
You have a couple bucks in
the bank and friends who love you,

23:45.166 --> 23:47.533
and that's a hell of a lot more
than most people have.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.667
And I'm just not gonna sit here

23:48.734 --> 23:51.967
and listen to you feeling sorry
for yourself, and neither is Rose.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.166
Yeah.

24:06.500 --> 24:07.667
She's right.
