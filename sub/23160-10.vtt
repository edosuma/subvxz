WEBVTT

00:03.279 --> 00:06.077
We're trapped on an island
that's used for gunnery practice.

00:06.157 --> 00:07.249
We're all gonna die.

00:07.324 --> 00:09.690
Who's gonna order
gunnery exercises on Christmas Eve?

00:09.760 --> 00:12.251
I am. By the time we're through,
I don't want to see an ant...

00:12.329 --> 00:13.421
left alive in that place.

00:13.497 --> 00:16.398
There are no pirates
or cannibals on this island.

00:16.467 --> 00:17.991
There is nothing on this island.

00:18.069 --> 00:20.367
Hurry up! Throw me a vine!
I'm going down quick!

00:20.438 --> 00:23.134
<i>My last will and testament.</i>

00:23.207 --> 00:25.266
♪ We wish you
a Merry Christmas ♪

00:25.342 --> 00:27.173
♪ We wish you
a Merry Christmas ♪

00:27.945 --> 00:28.934
We're gonna die.

00:29.013 --> 00:30.275
Oh, my God.

01:35.191 --> 01:36.739
<i>One of the
things about Paradise...</i>

01:36.816 --> 01:38.181
<i>that takes some
getting used to...</i>

01:38.251 --> 01:40.811
<i>is the change of seasons.
There aren't any.</i>

01:40.887 --> 01:43.355
<i>I mean, there are rainy
seasons and dryer times...</i>

01:43.423 --> 01:46.722
<i>but no real winter, summer,
spring and fall.</i>

01:46.793 --> 01:50.923
<i>It's just one more beautiful sunset
blending into another gorgeous sunrise...</i>

01:50.997 --> 01:54.125
<i>into another exquisite sunset.
And so on.</i>

01:54.200 --> 01:57.636
<i>So, sometimes the only way you
know it's the Christmas season...</i>

01:57.704 --> 02:01.435
<i>is by looking at the calendar or by
going into the department stores...</i>

02:01.508 --> 02:04.705
<i>or by just looking at the
flush of goodwill and cheer...</i>

02:04.778 --> 02:06.439
<i>on the faces of your friends.</i>

02:06.513 --> 02:08.913
You don't like it, you
can all just go ahead and jump.

02:08.982 --> 02:10.847
Well, this isn't
fair. We're gonna be late...

02:10.917 --> 02:12.350
because you overbooked us.

02:12.419 --> 02:14.478
Who says? We do!

02:14.554 --> 02:16.078
Well, you get what you pay for.

02:16.156 --> 02:17.282
And none of you paid.

02:17.357 --> 02:19.291
Where is your holiday spirit?

02:19.359 --> 02:20.917
Back home in New Orleans.

02:20.994 --> 02:24.361
Which is where I'm gonna be as soon
as Captain Calvin's Charity Chopper...

02:24.431 --> 02:25.898
drops all you freeloaders off.

02:25.965 --> 02:27.728
I am not a freeloader.

02:27.801 --> 02:31.032
Mr. Masters will remunerate
you for your time and service.

02:31.104 --> 02:33.231
Yeah,
one out of three ain't bad.

02:33.306 --> 02:35.331
Even after I drop you
off on Molokai...

02:35.408 --> 02:37.376
I still gotta drop
Orville off on Maui.

02:37.444 --> 02:39.674
Then I gotta take
Thomas to the Big Island.

02:39.746 --> 02:41.680
It's just
a slight detour, T.C.

02:41.748 --> 02:45.514
Yeah, and then bust my blades getting
back to the Honolulu International...

02:45.585 --> 02:47.075
to catch the red-eye
back home.

02:47.153 --> 02:49.713
Yeah, but doesn't
it feel good to be doing this?

02:49.789 --> 02:50.813
For your friends?

02:50.890 --> 02:51.879
No.

02:51.958 --> 02:53.892
The gift of giving.
And taking.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.793
Now, come on, T.C.,
you're just being silly.

02:56.863 --> 02:58.023
Me?

02:59.199 --> 03:00.564
Me, silly?

03:01.034 --> 03:03.161
Come on, guys, I'm doing
this for a good cause.

03:03.236 --> 03:05.329
Ho, ho, ho, Magnum.

03:05.405 --> 03:08.067
Hey, come on,
this is a mission of mercy.

03:08.141 --> 03:10.109
I'm gonna spend
my entire Christmas...

03:10.176 --> 03:12.110
entertaining those little kids.

03:12.178 --> 03:14.112
And their grown-up teacher.

03:14.180 --> 03:15.272
Sheryl.

03:16.716 --> 03:19.344
Hey, what
about Tiny Tim up here?

03:19.419 --> 03:20.852
That's not funny.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.753
Yeah. The First Annual
Santa's Little Helper...

03:23.823 --> 03:26.155
Beauty Contest at Lahaina.

03:26.226 --> 03:27.488
I'm a judge.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.994
Judge not, lest you be judged.

03:30.230 --> 03:31.458
What?

03:31.531 --> 03:34.193
He meant you're
going to owe me for this one.

03:34.801 --> 03:37.770
Santa's Little Helpers.
Bah, humbug.

03:37.837 --> 03:39.702
My sentiments precisely.

03:39.773 --> 03:43.300
The tawdry trivialization
and cheap commercialization...

03:43.376 --> 03:45.867
of perhaps the most sacred
moment in human history...

03:45.945 --> 03:48.539
indeed typifies
the decay and decline...

03:48.615 --> 03:50.913
of Western Civilization
as we know it.

03:50.984 --> 03:53.214
I thought I was just going
to judge a beauty contest.

03:53.286 --> 03:55.254
Yeah, and what's this
urgent business...

03:55.321 --> 03:58.085
you have for Robin Masters
on Molokai, Higgins?

03:58.158 --> 04:01.457
The foreman of Mr. Masters'
banana plantation suddenly quit.

04:01.528 --> 04:04.725
The workers are without their
Christmas bonuses. I'm to...

04:06.633 --> 04:07.759
Uh-oh.

04:07.834 --> 04:08.823
What?

04:11.638 --> 04:13.629
The tail rotor? Uh-huh.

04:13.706 --> 04:16.004
High frequency vibes.
Is that serious?

04:16.075 --> 04:20.409
Depends how badly you want to stay
up in the air. I gotta put her down.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.742
Where?

04:27.086 --> 04:28.644
Frenchman's Island?

04:48.842 --> 04:51.140
T.C., does it have to be here?

04:51.211 --> 04:53.304
Well, either
we land here or we swim.

04:53.379 --> 04:55.904
Extraordinary.
Takes me back to the time-

04:55.982 --> 04:57.950
Not now, Higgins.

04:58.017 --> 04:59.575
Hold on.

05:24.477 --> 05:26.069
You guys all right back there?

05:26.145 --> 05:27.544
Actually, we're fine.

05:27.981 --> 05:31.144
Magnum's beard seems to be
slightly askew, but other than that-

05:31.217 --> 05:33.583
I don't want
to hear it, Higgins.

05:39.692 --> 05:41.557
Hey, you know
what this place is?

05:41.628 --> 05:42.959
Of course.
It's an island.

05:43.029 --> 05:46.362
It's a free-fire island. The
Navy uses it for gunnery practice.

05:46.432 --> 05:49.560
Yeah, but it doesn't look like it's
been shelled around here in a long time.

05:49.636 --> 05:53.333
Extraordinary. The last time I
was under live artillery fire...

05:53.406 --> 05:54.532
was in the Suez.

05:55.174 --> 05:56.641
As you can well imagine-

05:56.709 --> 05:58.472
Higgins,
I don't want to hear it.

05:59.512 --> 06:01.104
Go get me the tool box.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.115
Hurry up, will you, Higgins?

06:05.184 --> 06:06.879
This place gives me the creeps.

06:06.953 --> 06:08.045
Quite.

06:09.589 --> 06:14.288
Although what you are feeling, would
more aptly be described as the willies.

06:15.428 --> 06:18.693
Come on, guys. Let's back up and
give T.C. some breathing space.

06:18.765 --> 06:21.529
I'm sure whatever the problem
is, it's relatively minor.

06:21.601 --> 06:23.000
Just a loose nut or something.

06:23.069 --> 06:24.764
He'll just find it,
tighten that sucker up.

06:24.837 --> 06:26.464
We'll be out of here.

06:35.949 --> 06:37.849
All right. Got it.

06:38.818 --> 06:42.982
Just a loose bolt in my pitch
change link. The cotter pin came out.

06:43.056 --> 06:45.217
Good. That means
we can get out of here.

06:45.558 --> 06:47.822
Yeah, you got it, buddy.
Just go hop right in.

06:47.894 --> 06:49.486
Thanks, T.C.
Good work.

06:49.629 --> 06:51.494
Thank you, T.C.
I knew you can do it.

06:51.564 --> 06:53.862
Ho, ho! Hello, Santa's Little Helpers.

06:54.133 --> 06:55.691
Bye-bye, barrage.

07:04.711 --> 07:06.702
Watch your hand.

07:11.985 --> 07:13.452
Well, I guess
those banana workers...

07:13.519 --> 07:15.146
will have their Christmas
after all.

07:15.221 --> 07:17.280
And those orphans. Pity.

07:17.357 --> 07:19.825
What?
Nothing. Nothing.

07:19.892 --> 07:22.122
I was just thinking
of the fun we could have had.

07:22.195 --> 07:24.993
Fun? Come on, T.C.
Let's hit it.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.534
I'm trying.

07:30.670 --> 07:31.659
Damn.

07:31.738 --> 07:33.831
What's going on?
I don't know.

07:33.906 --> 07:34.964
I do.

07:35.241 --> 07:37.471
This oversized eggbeater
isn't starting.

07:38.144 --> 07:40.271
We are going to stay right here.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.414
This is your fault, T.C.

07:42.482 --> 07:44.211
My fault?
Why is it my fault?

07:44.283 --> 07:46.683
You got it,
because you overbooked us.

07:46.753 --> 07:48.846
Oh, guys, guys. Calm down.

07:48.921 --> 07:51.151
Quit arguing.
Let's be rational.

07:51.224 --> 07:52.657
Everything's gonna be all right.

07:52.725 --> 07:54.920
T.C. will find the problem
and fix it.

07:55.161 --> 07:57.686
I mean, so what if we are gonna
be here a little while longer...

07:57.764 --> 07:59.857
maybe an hour or two.

07:59.966 --> 08:02.560
Who's gonna order gunnery
exercises on Christmas Eve?

08:03.036 --> 08:04.196
<i>I am.</i>

08:05.238 --> 08:06.899
Commencing at 2400 hours.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.803
That's midnight
Christmas Eve, sir.

08:08.875 --> 08:10.035
I mean, the men thought...

08:10.109 --> 08:11.371
The men thought?

08:11.744 --> 08:15.976
That is, this is a time when the men
want to be with their families, sir.

08:16.049 --> 08:18.483
Are you aware, Ensign, of
the absolute abysmal record...

08:18.551 --> 08:20.143
of this ship
in field marksmanship?

08:20.219 --> 08:23.382
Yes, sir, in our last exercises we were.
- Dead last.

08:23.456 --> 08:26.016
Yes, sir. But I'm certain
we can do better next time.

08:26.092 --> 08:27.559
You're damn right
they'll do better.

08:27.627 --> 08:29.595
They'll do better because
every man in this unit...

08:29.662 --> 08:31.789
is gonna learn the meaning
of the word dedication.

08:32.865 --> 08:34.525
I am not gonna be embarrassed...

08:34.600 --> 08:36.625
the next time
their scores are posted.

08:37.770 --> 08:39.169
We understand each other?

08:39.238 --> 08:40.330
Yes, sir.

08:44.143 --> 08:45.872
What do you want me to do, sir?

08:47.613 --> 08:49.843
What I want you to do
is to cancel all leaves.

08:49.916 --> 08:51.315
Select targets.

08:51.684 --> 08:54.118
And set sail immediately
for Frenchman's Island.

08:54.887 --> 08:57.014
And when we get there,
destroy it.

08:57.490 --> 08:59.924
By the time we're through,
I don't want to see an ant...

08:59.992 --> 09:01.459
left alive in that place.

09:01.527 --> 09:02.926
Aye, aye, sir.

09:11.921 --> 09:13.980
How long?
I don't know.

09:14.056 --> 09:15.546
Oh, that's great.
Just great.

09:15.624 --> 09:17.489
Now I'm gonna miss
the beauty pageant.

09:17.560 --> 09:18.788
Possibly.

09:18.861 --> 09:20.624
But think
of the glorious adventure...

09:20.696 --> 09:22.288
we can have here on this isle.

09:22.364 --> 09:25.265
I don't like adventures.
What's wrong with this thing?

09:25.334 --> 09:26.460
I don't know.

09:26.535 --> 09:29.003
It could be the exciter.
It could be the points.

09:29.071 --> 09:31.835
Hey, why don't you just bang on
it, with a ball peen hammer...

09:31.907 --> 09:35.172
like you did that time in
Bin Loc? It started right up.

09:35.244 --> 09:37.212
Because it might
not be the exciter.

09:37.279 --> 09:39.008
We've only got one shot
with that thing.

09:39.081 --> 09:41.311
We make a mistake,
we melt the whole engine down.

09:41.383 --> 09:42.407
Melt the engine?

09:42.485 --> 09:45.682
Yeah, then it could be the voltage
regulator, it could be the battery...

09:45.754 --> 09:47.915
it could be the ignition, it
could be the starter button.

09:47.990 --> 09:49.981
I don't know. I gotta check
everything. This could take-

09:50.059 --> 09:52.994
Days.
What a marvelous challenge.

09:53.062 --> 09:56.088
Just the four of us against the
elements. Survival of the fittest.

09:56.165 --> 09:57.962
What are you talking about?
What elements?

09:58.033 --> 10:00.627
Man against nature.
Civilization versus-

10:00.703 --> 10:02.967
Higgins, this is not
a boy scout overnight.

10:03.038 --> 10:05.472
We're trapped on an island
that's used for gunnery practice.

10:05.541 --> 10:06.633
We're all gonna die here.

10:06.709 --> 10:08.574
Oh, Rick, take it easy.
Nobody's gonna die.

10:08.644 --> 10:11.670
Come here, give me a hand
with this, will you? Come on.

10:11.747 --> 10:13.374
I mean, no one is
going to authorize...

10:13.449 --> 10:15.440
gunnery exercises
on Christmas Eve.

10:15.518 --> 10:17.213
It's real simple.
I'll just get on the radio...

10:17.286 --> 10:18.810
call the Coast Guard.

10:18.888 --> 10:20.788
And they'll pick us up.

10:20.890 --> 10:22.289
Magnum, for once in your life...

10:22.358 --> 10:24.292
you are being
mundanely practical.

10:24.593 --> 10:26.322
How utterly unlike you.

10:27.062 --> 10:29.929
However, it could take hours
before they get here.

10:29.999 --> 10:32.661
We could utilize the time
to explore and forage.

10:33.335 --> 10:35.769
What a pity the lads
aren't here to enjoy this.

10:36.171 --> 10:40.005
Mayday. Mayday. This is
905 Alpha. Mayday. Mayday.

10:44.813 --> 10:46.212
What is that?

10:56.392 --> 10:58.826
What is that?
<i>Ukulele Lady.</i>

10:58.894 --> 11:02.762
Written in 1925 by Gus Kahn,
Richard Whiting and Irving Berlin.

11:03.265 --> 11:05.961
The gentleman who is singing
it is obviously intoxicated.

11:06.035 --> 11:07.730
Not only has he transposed
the verses...

11:07.803 --> 11:10.533
but he has discovered a key
heretofore unknown to the human ear.

11:10.606 --> 11:12.198
Higgins!

11:14.209 --> 11:17.269
Hey, man, are you sure you
got that thing on 121.5?

11:17.346 --> 11:19.576
There's something wrong
with the frequency selector.

11:19.648 --> 11:21.172
Keeps drifting off the band.

11:21.250 --> 11:22.683
So does he.

11:23.552 --> 11:24.917
Mayday. Mayday.
This-

11:31.727 --> 11:33.024
Mayday! Mayday!

11:36.832 --> 11:38.823
Hey, do I have to do everything?

11:38.901 --> 11:41.631
Fly you here, fly you there,
fix the chopper.

11:41.704 --> 11:43.296
Talk on the microphone.

11:43.372 --> 11:44.361
Crash.

11:44.740 --> 11:47.538
Hey, I was doing
you guys the favor.

11:47.610 --> 11:49.077
You with your beauty pageants...

11:49.144 --> 11:51.271
your girlfriends,
and your urgent missions.

11:51.347 --> 11:52.712
I am the one
going to see my family...

11:52.781 --> 11:54.510
for the first time in six years.

11:54.583 --> 11:57.484
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

12:04.627 --> 12:07.755
Mayday. Mayday.
905 Alpha.

12:12.835 --> 12:15.463
Mayday. Mayday.
905 Alpha.

12:18.307 --> 12:19.774
Better save the battery.

12:19.842 --> 12:21.833
No, no, don't give up.
Somebody might answer.

12:21.910 --> 12:25.812
No, it's not transmitting. Landing so
hard must've jarred something loose.

12:25.881 --> 12:28.042
Great. Now we'll never get out of here.

12:28.117 --> 12:30.312
Rick, the Coast Guard
will come looking for us...

12:30.386 --> 12:32.149
as soon as they realize
we're overdue at Molokai.

12:32.221 --> 12:34.246
There's absolutely
nothing to worry about.

12:34.323 --> 12:35.449
Well...

12:40.462 --> 12:44.694
in the meantime, I will begin
to forage food for our supper.

12:44.767 --> 12:48.726
What food? What supper? Who says
we're gonna be here that long?

12:53.642 --> 12:55.667
What can I do to help?
Nothing.

12:55.744 --> 12:57.541
Well, how long
is this gonna take?

12:57.813 --> 12:59.940
Look, Rick, give me
some breathing room.

13:02.084 --> 13:05.713
Rick, come on, let's go look for
some wood for a signal fire. Come on.

13:10.059 --> 13:11.959
Go! Okay, I'm going, I'm going.

13:22.004 --> 13:25.496
Hey, Thomas, Thomas. Wait up.
You're going too fast.

13:26.275 --> 13:28.334
I don't like this place.
It's quiet.

13:28.410 --> 13:30.139
Yeah. Too quiet.

13:30.212 --> 13:32.112
Oh, sure, very funny.
Joke around.

13:32.181 --> 13:34.342
I can't help it.
You're just so serious.

13:34.416 --> 13:37.681
Well, excuse me. That's my natural
reaction when my life is in danger.

13:37.753 --> 13:39.778
Of course, I could have
a more mature attitude...

13:39.855 --> 13:41.686
be a clown, have a few laughs.

13:41.757 --> 13:44.123
Rick,
your life is not in danger.

13:44.193 --> 13:45.922
That's debatable.

13:46.261 --> 13:49.321
Hell, this place is spooky.
It reminds me of Nam.

13:51.533 --> 13:55.128
Thomas, there's something
I got to tell you.

13:55.938 --> 13:56.962
I don't know.

13:57.039 --> 13:59.132
Just in case
we don't get out of here.

13:59.875 --> 14:00.864
Well...

14:01.243 --> 14:03.541
when I was a little kid
I did something...

14:03.879 --> 14:05.506
that, you well,
I'm not real proud of.

14:05.581 --> 14:07.606
In fact, I'm darned right
ashamed of it.

14:07.683 --> 14:09.173
Rick! Don't.

14:09.251 --> 14:11.185
No, no. No! I got to
get it off my chest.

14:11.253 --> 14:14.120
Don't move a muscle.

14:14.490 --> 14:15.650
What?

14:15.724 --> 14:18.352
Stand absolutely still.

14:19.661 --> 14:21.322
What?
There's a...

14:21.997 --> 14:23.521
A bug!
In your shirt.

14:29.271 --> 14:31.637
That isn't funny!

14:36.211 --> 14:38.736
It's tragic. Very tragic.

14:40.349 --> 14:41.907
A whole generation
of fighting men...

14:41.984 --> 14:44.179
without any real experience
in fighting.

14:45.754 --> 14:49.121
Of course, that's all reflected
in our ship's poor ratings.

14:49.958 --> 14:53.519
I'm going to change all that,
Jensen. The men work hard, sir.

14:54.830 --> 14:56.855
It takes more than hard work.

14:58.133 --> 14:59.930
Sometimes it takes a war.

15:03.772 --> 15:06.536
I'm afraid this is not going to
be much of a Christmas, is it?

15:06.608 --> 15:08.576
No, sir, I suppose it isn't.

15:10.078 --> 15:12.672
Well, you'll have
other Christmases.

15:14.149 --> 15:15.673
Your Christmases.

15:17.252 --> 15:18.776
I've had mine.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.654
An ice breaker in the Antarctic.

15:24.159 --> 15:25.683
A gunboat in the Delta.

15:26.995 --> 15:29.725
A stray escort
in the North Atlantic.

15:31.767 --> 15:33.462
Just like the good old days.

15:34.903 --> 15:36.370
Yes, sir.

15:39.875 --> 15:42.435
Okay, 10 hours 43 minutes.

15:42.878 --> 15:45.642
Clear this away. I'd like to
take a look at that map again.

15:45.714 --> 15:46.976
Yes, sir.

16:47.576 --> 16:50.511
Any luck? What's that?

16:50.579 --> 16:53.673
Will you stop that? No. I'm
serious. Listen, don't you hear it?

16:55.150 --> 16:57.482
A chopper.
It's the Coast Guard!

17:02.758 --> 17:05.625
Hey!

17:13.268 --> 17:15.531
Hey!

17:18.941 --> 17:19.930
Help!

17:21.009 --> 17:22.636
Hey!

17:26.515 --> 17:27.675
Damn.

17:29.184 --> 17:30.583
They'll be back.

17:31.619 --> 17:35.350
They will. Once we get a signal
fire started, they can't miss us.

17:38.360 --> 17:39.520
Where's Higgins?

17:39.594 --> 17:41.619
Exploring and foraging.

17:42.464 --> 17:45.399
He never came back? Maybe
we'd better go look for him.

17:45.467 --> 17:48.368
Oh, he's probably having
a good old time.

17:49.404 --> 17:52.601
Like Stewart Granger in <i>King
Solomon's Mines</i> or something.

17:52.674 --> 17:54.574
Stewart Granger
was trapped in a cave.

17:54.642 --> 17:56.439
Yeah, but he got out.
It was really neat.

17:56.511 --> 17:57.705
I'm going to go look for him.

17:57.779 --> 18:00.339
You should've seen what happened.
- Come on.

18:06.488 --> 18:08.422
Are you sure this
is the direction he went in?

18:08.490 --> 18:10.321
This is the direction
he went in when he started.

18:10.392 --> 18:11.416
Now that's just great.

18:11.493 --> 18:12.619
That just means he could
be anywhere.

18:12.694 --> 18:14.662
I don't like this place. Rick!

18:14.729 --> 18:16.196
Okay.

18:17.932 --> 18:20.457
Look. Footprints.

18:22.637 --> 18:24.798
Holy cow. A peg leg.

18:28.042 --> 18:30.374
That's not a peg leg.
It's a...

18:31.780 --> 18:34.578
What? What has one left foot
and a stick for the right?

18:34.649 --> 18:36.207
Robinson Crusoe?

18:38.286 --> 18:41.119
Come on, I'm sure there's a
logical explanation for all this.

18:41.189 --> 18:43.987
Aye, pirates, me hearties.

18:44.759 --> 18:47.227
Cannibals.
Are you guys both going crazy?

18:47.295 --> 18:49.991
There are no pirates
or cannibals on this island.

18:50.064 --> 18:52.123
There is nothing
on this island. Nothing!

18:52.200 --> 18:54.532
All right,
then where is Higgins?

18:54.669 --> 18:56.500
Probably simmering
in a pot right now.

18:56.571 --> 18:58.198
We'd better find him
and find him fast.

18:58.273 --> 18:59.797
Come on.

19:01.176 --> 19:03.644
I saw this movie once
called, <i>The Island.</i>

19:03.711 --> 19:05.679
There were these pirate guys
on this island.

19:05.747 --> 19:07.908
Now, when they were on this
island, nobody knew that they-

19:10.251 --> 19:11.684
Listen.

19:11.753 --> 19:13.118
Oh, my God.

19:13.188 --> 19:15.383
Higgins! Higgins!

19:21.129 --> 19:23.859
Really. Must the three of you
act like cannibals?

19:24.632 --> 19:25.894
The peg leg.

19:28.470 --> 19:32.566
And he was dragging that plant
covering up the other footprint.

19:34.509 --> 19:36.739
My God, has the jungle
gotten to you so soon?

19:36.811 --> 19:38.438
Pull yourselves together, lads.

19:38.513 --> 19:43.143
For I have made a most astounding
discovery. Exhilarating, actually.

19:44.686 --> 19:47.052
It's a wrecked plane, so?

19:47.322 --> 19:49.313
What's so
exhilarating about that?

19:49.390 --> 19:51.449
To you, perhaps,
it is a wrecked plane.

19:51.526 --> 19:53.323
To me, it is a way out of here.

19:53.394 --> 19:55.487
What are you talking about,
Higgins?

19:55.563 --> 19:58.031
It reminds me of the time
I was stranded on an island...

19:58.099 --> 19:59.532
off the northern coast
of Africa.

19:59.601 --> 20:01.398
I had been wounded
and rendered unconscious...

20:01.469 --> 20:04.461
for what must have been a full
week. Imagine my surprise...

20:04.539 --> 20:05.733
when I woke to find that I-

20:05.807 --> 20:08.708
Can you cut to the part where
you get to the wrecked plane?

20:08.776 --> 20:10.266
Oh. Quite.

20:10.612 --> 20:14.639
Magnum, I think you'll find
this quite interesting.

20:19.954 --> 20:21.546
Magnum?

20:23.591 --> 20:25.855
I think we've found
more than just a plane.

20:50.495 --> 20:52.128
There's another guy who
didn't make it off the island.

20:52.202 --> 20:54.295
Rick. Well, sorry.

20:57.540 --> 20:59.337
Imperial Air Force.

21:00.777 --> 21:03.575
And from the looks
of the plane...

21:03.813 --> 21:05.337
a reconnaissance pilot.

21:06.416 --> 21:09.544
Must've been the pilot who
scouted the Pearl Harbor attack.

21:09.619 --> 21:11.484
That's quite possible.

21:12.789 --> 21:16.418
This gentleman then was responsible
for a heavy loss of life.

21:16.493 --> 21:18.017
Including his own.

21:18.361 --> 21:19.623
Quite.

21:20.096 --> 21:21.393
MIA.

21:21.731 --> 21:22.891
What?

21:23.133 --> 21:24.600
He's probably listed as an MIA.

21:24.668 --> 21:27.159
Yeah, well, I bet you his
family's through looking for him.

21:27.237 --> 21:30.536
Come on, Higgins, what's your
plan? What are you doing, Magnum?

21:30.607 --> 21:31.869
I'm looking for a serial number.

21:31.942 --> 21:36.038
I'm sure there's somebody who would
like to know he's not missing any more.

21:38.315 --> 21:41.045
Thomas, we've got to
get out of here ourselves.

21:41.117 --> 21:43.745
Plus we got to get the fire
started. We got to get the chopper-

21:43.820 --> 21:45.981
He may have been on the other
side. But he was a soldier.

21:46.056 --> 21:47.546
Just doing his job.

21:51.695 --> 21:53.720
Yeah, I know
where you're coming from.

21:55.799 --> 21:57.824
It could have been
any one of us.

22:21.725 --> 22:24.125
Back to the living. Us.

22:26.062 --> 22:28.087
This way, gentlemen.

22:28.465 --> 22:31.593
This, of course, will rank as one
of my most crowning achievements.

22:31.668 --> 22:33.033
What's he talking about now?

22:33.103 --> 22:35.162
You know, Higgins,
you're really a genius.

22:35.238 --> 22:36.830
How're you
going to get it to fly?

22:36.906 --> 22:40.034
I'm not going to get it to fly.
I'm going to get it to float.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.305
Oh, yeah. Right. Well, I
guess that will work, too.

22:42.379 --> 22:44.006
I don't see how.

22:44.080 --> 22:47.743
Oh, ye of paltry imaginations,
must I spell everything out?

22:47.817 --> 22:49.341
Something.

22:49.419 --> 22:52.547
As you can see, this aircraft is
constructed of stressed aluminum.

22:52.622 --> 22:55.250
This light-weight material
contributed to its considerable range.

22:55.325 --> 22:57.418
653 miles to be precise.

22:57.494 --> 23:00.019
You may find this interesting,
most people don't realize-

23:00.096 --> 23:03.793
Higgins, please. Can we save the
stories until we get out of here.

23:04.634 --> 23:07.364
Quite right, Rick.
Well, let's get to it.

23:08.405 --> 23:09.702
Get to what?

23:09.773 --> 23:13.106
I propose that we shear off the top
of the fuselage, remove the engines...

23:13.176 --> 23:17.670
discard the wings, patch those areas
with woven palm fronds using glue...

23:17.747 --> 23:21.444
made from the remnants of petroleum in
the wing tanks and gum from the tires...

23:21.518 --> 23:23.486
thereby creating essentially
an outrigger canoe...

23:23.553 --> 23:25.612
enabling us to sail
the blazes away.

23:25.688 --> 23:27.155
You saw, <i>Flight of the Phoenix.</i>

23:27.223 --> 23:28.383
To Molokai.

23:28.491 --> 23:29.549
You're crazy.

23:29.626 --> 23:31.491
Oh, I think
that's a bit harsh, T.C.

23:31.561 --> 23:33.825
Overly optimistic, perhaps,
but...

23:33.897 --> 23:34.886
Crazy.

23:34.964 --> 23:37.524
That's what they said about
Columbus. And he discovered America.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.727
In a boat.
Not in a Japanese plane.

23:39.803 --> 23:42.067
I mean, if you're so set
on taking a cruise...

23:42.138 --> 23:44.902
you might as well take the
flotation devices off the chopper.

23:44.974 --> 23:47.238
Sort of floating hors
d'oeuvres for the sharks?

23:47.310 --> 23:48.368
No, thank you.

23:48.445 --> 23:51.972
I intend to make this into a seaworthy
vessel if I have to do it by myself.

23:52.048 --> 23:54.573
Now are you going to assist
in this endeavor or not?

23:55.151 --> 23:57.881
Well, sure, Higgins.
Of course we'll help.

23:58.288 --> 23:59.380
Thank you, Magnum.

23:59.456 --> 24:02.357
It also took some time for
Columbus to be appreciated.

24:02.425 --> 24:03.892
He was looking for India.

24:04.561 --> 24:05.960
What can we do?

24:06.029 --> 24:08.896
Well, if someone will retrieve
the hacksaw from T.C.'s toolbox...

24:08.965 --> 24:10.330
I'll make the incisions.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.095
Then, we'll need wood
for the fire...

24:12.168 --> 24:13.533
and palm fronds
for the patching.

24:13.603 --> 24:15.434
The greener the better.
The thicker the better.

24:15.505 --> 24:17.598
Great, Higgins. We'll give it
the old college try.

24:17.674 --> 24:18.663
Good.

24:18.741 --> 24:20.038
Are you serious?

24:20.243 --> 24:22.973
Oh, come on, T.C.
What can it hurt to try?

24:23.046 --> 24:25.241
Besides, this is the time of
year where you're supposed to...

24:25.315 --> 24:27.306
enjoy helping each other out.

24:28.585 --> 24:31.145
Oh, yeah. Right. Well.

24:32.322 --> 24:33.584
You help.

24:33.756 --> 24:35.917
You take care
of the important stuff.

24:35.992 --> 24:38.620
I'm going to go see if I
can get the chopper working.

24:40.697 --> 24:43.063
I'll see what I can find.
The greener the better.

24:43.133 --> 24:45.328
The thicker the better.
Quite.

24:45.735 --> 24:48.761
This is a terrific idea.
Terrific.

24:48.838 --> 24:50.203
Thank you.

24:50.607 --> 24:51.665
You know, Higgins...

24:51.741 --> 24:54.005
there's something that I
always wanted to tell you.

24:54.077 --> 24:58.537
I mean, deep down,
you're really an okay guy.

25:00.183 --> 25:01.707
How reassuring.

25:05.088 --> 25:06.419
Higgins...

25:07.390 --> 25:09.358
there's something that,
well... I mean...

25:09.425 --> 25:11.916
there's something that
I want to get off my chest.

25:12.028 --> 25:14.121
It's about my cousin, Jenny.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.023
I'm not real proud of it.

25:16.099 --> 25:18.693
In fact,
I'm downright ashamed of it.

25:19.269 --> 25:21.737
It was in the fourth grade
and after school I-

25:21.804 --> 25:23.931
Rick, please,
this is no time for long...

25:24.007 --> 25:25.941
boring and irrelevant stories.

25:26.009 --> 25:28.341
Now go and collect
those palm fronds.

25:30.313 --> 25:32.213
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, sure.

25:34.017 --> 25:37.145
Sure. Big and green.

25:38.087 --> 25:39.611
Big and green.

25:41.558 --> 25:44.026
Big and green.
Big and green.

25:45.328 --> 25:47.819
Wants big and green.
I'll get big and green.

25:55.305 --> 25:57.102
That's big and green.

26:04.614 --> 26:07.447
Oh, God! Quicksand.

26:07.650 --> 26:08.878
Thomas!

26:09.786 --> 26:11.310
Thomas!

26:13.223 --> 26:14.485
Higgins!

26:17.427 --> 26:19.156
Higgins! Thomas!

26:20.330 --> 26:21.558
T.C.!

26:21.898 --> 26:25.061
Help me, I'm sinking! Higgins!

26:25.401 --> 26:28.837
Thomas! Thomas!

26:30.807 --> 26:33.571
Orville Rick Wright.

26:34.244 --> 26:37.736
The best darn gunner
in the Marine Corps.

26:38.381 --> 26:42.750
Irresistible to women.
Legendary in the ring.

26:44.787 --> 26:46.311
And...

26:46.389 --> 26:50.723
And the greatest buddy
a guy could ask for.

26:59.969 --> 27:02.836
A keen mind and quick wit...

27:03.640 --> 27:05.972
diplomatic, conscientious...

27:06.843 --> 27:09.311
a terrific conversationalist.

27:10.346 --> 27:12.507
He shall be sorely missed.

27:15.218 --> 27:18.210
"Sorry I had to miss
the funeral."

27:18.288 --> 27:22.349
"Enjoy the Big Casino
in the sky. Ice Pick."

27:38.708 --> 27:40.733
We're gonna miss you, pal.

27:43.246 --> 27:44.270
No!

27:46.849 --> 27:48.146
Rick!

27:50.219 --> 27:52.153
Orville, what are you
doing in there?

27:52.221 --> 27:54.451
I'm sinking in quicksand!
Hurry up!

27:54.524 --> 27:56.549
Throw me a vine!
I'm going down quick!

27:56.626 --> 27:57.718
Help me!

27:57.794 --> 27:58.954
Stand up.

27:59.028 --> 28:00.052
What?

28:00.129 --> 28:01.426
Stand up.

28:09.439 --> 28:11.873
You mean this...
This isn't...

28:12.275 --> 28:13.742
No, it isn't.

28:15.345 --> 28:16.710
It's a bog.

28:16.779 --> 28:19.077
There is no quicksand in Hawaii.

28:19.882 --> 28:20.940
Oh.

28:22.251 --> 28:23.309
Come on.

28:23.386 --> 28:25.377
Wait. I have to get my fronds.

28:25.555 --> 28:26.647
Oh, yeah.

28:26.723 --> 28:29.624
The Higgins Paradise Cruise's
Luxury Liner.

28:36.599 --> 28:38.032
Watch out for that centipede.

28:38.101 --> 28:39.159
What centipede?

28:39.235 --> 28:40.293
The one next to the lizard.

28:40.370 --> 28:41.632
What lizard?

28:46.442 --> 28:48.103
That's isn't funny!

28:48.978 --> 28:50.275
<i>It's inspirational.</i>

28:50.646 --> 28:51.704
Sir?

28:51.781 --> 28:55.410
The way the men pull together to
see a mission successfully completed.

28:55.485 --> 28:57.817
Like our ship's
gonna do tonight.

28:58.254 --> 28:59.949
All right.
What've we got?

29:00.056 --> 29:02.149
Our choice of targets, sir.

29:04.594 --> 29:05.686
Mmm-hmm.

29:05.928 --> 29:08.123
Abandoned
vehicles have been targeted...

29:08.197 --> 29:09.425
across the island...

29:09.499 --> 29:12.935
but the jungle has had the least
amount of activity in prior exercises.

29:14.337 --> 29:15.463
Well, that is...

29:15.538 --> 29:17.165
No, no, continue.

29:17.807 --> 29:21.868
Well, that is the targets would
therefore be easily accounted for-

29:21.944 --> 29:23.172
Easily?

29:23.546 --> 29:26.743
Well, I don't mean easy in the
sense of shirking our duty, sir, I-

29:26.816 --> 29:29.284
Don't you know a joke
when you hear one, Ensign?

29:30.186 --> 29:32.120
Of course
we'll shell the jungle.

29:32.622 --> 29:35.250
Let me know when you're
ready to commence firing.

29:35.558 --> 29:37.048
Aye, aye, sir.

29:41.531 --> 29:43.522
<i>And heave!</i>

29:45.034 --> 29:46.661
And heave!

29:48.271 --> 29:49.898
And heave!

29:52.408 --> 29:54.205
And heave!

29:56.712 --> 29:58.839
And heave!

30:00.817 --> 30:02.751
And heave!

30:04.954 --> 30:06.819
And heave!

30:08.558 --> 30:09.718
Hi, guys.

30:09.792 --> 30:11.191
Oh, Magnum. Good.

30:11.260 --> 30:13.785
Give us a hand
with this, will you?

30:13.863 --> 30:15.797
Oh, Higgins, I kind
of got my hands full...

30:15.865 --> 30:17.355
keeping the signal fire going.

30:17.433 --> 30:18.559
Forget the fire, Thomas.

30:18.634 --> 30:20.568
We're gonna get out of
here on Higgins' boat.

30:22.004 --> 30:24.734
I fail to find any humor
in this, Magnum.

30:24.807 --> 30:28.334
We need your assistance in getting this
vessel to shore and we need it now.

30:28.578 --> 30:30.808
Okay, Higgins. I'll just
put this wood on the fire...

30:30.880 --> 30:32.905
and then I'll come back
and give you guys a hand.

30:32.982 --> 30:36.440
As your Commander-in-Chief, I order
you to cease your current activities...

30:36.519 --> 30:39.113
and report immediately
to boat detail.

30:39.355 --> 30:43.724
Higgins, that is not a boat.
That is a plane.

30:43.960 --> 30:46.224
And you are not
my Commander-in-Chief.

30:46.529 --> 30:50.260
I must warn you, you're skating
dangerously close to insubordination.

30:53.636 --> 30:55.536
Fine. Fine.

30:55.605 --> 30:57.664
You wanna play
your little games? Fine!

30:57.740 --> 30:59.207
But you're going
to have to wait...

30:59.275 --> 31:01.209
till I put this wood
on that fire.

31:01.277 --> 31:02.767
I'm not gonna
take another chance...

31:02.845 --> 31:04.710
on the coastguard
missing us again.

31:06.582 --> 31:10.245
You know, you're the one who's always
accusing me of acting like a kid.

31:10.319 --> 31:11.411
Well, look at you.

31:11.487 --> 31:13.387
You're like
an overgrown Boy Scout...

31:13.456 --> 31:16.186
trying to earn
his Survival Merit Badge.

31:16.692 --> 31:17.954
Now, okay.

31:18.027 --> 31:19.153
Maybe you are right.

31:19.228 --> 31:20.923
Maybe, for once,
I am being practical...

31:20.997 --> 31:22.931
even mundanely practical...

31:22.999 --> 31:25.832
but I want to make sure
that we get off of here.

31:25.902 --> 31:28.894
So I'm going
to walk up that beach...

31:29.205 --> 31:32.766
and then I'm going to put
this wood on that fire...

31:32.909 --> 31:35.207
and then, and only then...

31:35.645 --> 31:38.443
will I come back
and help you guys out.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.010
Quite.

31:51.193 --> 31:53.127
And heave!

31:56.432 --> 31:58.195
And heave!

32:04.607 --> 32:05.835
And-

32:07.710 --> 32:08.938
Come on.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.211
A little to your left.

32:12.281 --> 32:13.839
And mind the exposed root there.

32:13.916 --> 32:15.907
We don't want to inflict
any damage to the hull.

32:15.985 --> 32:17.316
Don't push it, Higgins.

32:17.386 --> 32:18.944
And heave!

32:20.323 --> 32:22.814

32:40.209 --> 32:42.507
See what?
Just come on. Come on.

32:56.559 --> 32:58.857
It isn't going to work.
Look how flimsy it is.

32:58.928 --> 33:00.395
Nonsense.

33:00.463 --> 33:02.931
<i>The Zeus Apollo II</i>
is quite sturdy.

33:03.132 --> 33:04.497
<i>Zeus Apollo II?</i>

33:04.567 --> 33:06.467
Named after its predecessor...

33:06.535 --> 33:09.527
during the time I was on that
island off the coast of Africa.

33:09.672 --> 33:12.197
I thought I'd told you
about that, Rick.

33:12.274 --> 33:13.263
Oh.

33:13.342 --> 33:15.435
Nevertheless, this
incarnation, I have no doubt...

33:15.511 --> 33:17.877
will be equally as successful
as the original.

33:17.947 --> 33:19.346
The original <i>Titanic.</i>

33:19.415 --> 33:20.848
Scoff if you will.

33:20.916 --> 33:22.645
But after I make
a brief test run...

33:22.718 --> 33:24.948
the four of us
will set sail for Molokai.

33:25.121 --> 33:28.249
Yeah, well, put me down
for 4:00 shuffle board.

33:28.624 --> 33:31.184
Come on, T.C. I mean,
we gotta hand it to Higgins.

33:31.260 --> 33:33.888
I thought
this was a half-baked idea...

33:34.497 --> 33:36.727
but it looks like it'll float.

33:37.233 --> 33:38.530
Oh, it will float.

33:39.335 --> 33:41.860
It may be a trifle difficult
to steer...

33:41.937 --> 33:43.461
but it will float.

33:43.539 --> 33:45.234
You can depend on that.

33:45.307 --> 33:48.105
We shall be home in time
for Christmas dinner.

33:48.177 --> 33:50.145
Now, shove me off, lads.

33:51.914 --> 33:53.279
Heave!

33:54.250 --> 33:55.740
Heave!

33:56.886 --> 33:58.046
Heave!

33:58.120 --> 34:00.145
Actually, I
think it's rather fitting...

34:00.222 --> 34:02.713
that we find our way home
in a small sailing vessel.

34:02.792 --> 34:04.191
After all the Polynesians...

34:04.260 --> 34:05.784
who first settled the Islands...

34:05.861 --> 34:07.658
traveled great distances
in canoes...

34:07.730 --> 34:09.721
that were much smaller
and more fragile...

34:09.799 --> 34:11.664
than our sturdy little...

34:17.672 --> 34:18.867
craft.

34:41.146 --> 34:44.138
"My rare edition
of <i>Military Maneuvers...</i>"

34:45.317 --> 34:50.219
"I bequeath
to Agatha Chumley."

34:52.558 --> 34:54.185
She'll like that.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.832
"My handcrafted replica..."

35:06.405 --> 35:09.169
"of the bridge
on the river Kwai..."

35:10.476 --> 35:12.239
"I bequeath to..."

35:16.515 --> 35:17.846
"Thomas..."

35:20.519 --> 35:21.918
"Sullivan..."

35:25.824 --> 35:27.086
"Magnum."

35:33.899 --> 35:37.699
He's going to die on this
godforsaken isle the same time I do.

35:42.708 --> 35:45.006
"The bridge on the river Kwai..."

35:46.745 --> 35:49.145
"and the rest
of my possessions..."

35:49.948 --> 35:51.745
"to go to the lads..."

35:53.986 --> 35:57.444
"Apollo and Zeus."

36:00.859 --> 36:02.850
They'll appreciate that.

36:13.238 --> 36:15.763
Hi. Where's Thomas?

36:16.175 --> 36:18.871
He'll be back in a minute.
Said he had something to do.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.541
How're you coming along there?

36:22.448 --> 36:25.645
Closer. I think I've
narrowed it down considerably.

36:27.486 --> 36:28.976
T.C...
Mmm-hmm?

36:30.956 --> 36:33.686
There's something
that I wanna tell you...

36:34.460 --> 36:37.657
just in case
we don't get out of here.

36:37.729 --> 36:38.821
What?

36:39.932 --> 36:42.332
Well, it's something
that I'm not real proud of.

36:42.401 --> 36:44.926
In fact,
I'm downright ashamed of it.

36:45.137 --> 36:46.399
Mmm-hmm?

36:46.472 --> 36:48.997
See, it's about my cousin,
Jenny.

36:49.074 --> 36:50.701
When I was
in the fourth grade, I-

36:50.776 --> 36:53.074
I already know about this, Rick.

36:54.046 --> 36:55.206
You do?

36:55.614 --> 36:57.275
Yeah, you told me.

36:57.349 --> 36:58.839
I did?
Uh-huh.

36:59.418 --> 37:02.581
At Khe Sanh when the mortar
shells were coming in.

37:05.991 --> 37:09.085
Of course later on you
told me you were kidding.

37:09.161 --> 37:10.219
Oh.

37:16.135 --> 37:18.433
Higgins still moping around
on the beach?

37:18.504 --> 37:19.596
Yeah.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.671
Excuse me.

37:32.851 --> 37:36.116
Perhaps if I had
reinforced the hull...

37:42.594 --> 37:43.652
Hey!

37:47.166 --> 37:50.101
Looks like we got
the fire going real strong.

37:50.836 --> 37:53.168
Coast Guard will be able
to see us for sure now...

37:53.238 --> 37:54.899
once it gets dark.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.073
Hey, come on, man.

38:02.247 --> 38:04.238
Don't be so hard on yourself.

38:04.316 --> 38:06.944
It's not your fault
that the plane...

38:07.019 --> 38:08.850
I mean, the boat sank.

38:09.588 --> 38:11.988
Too many years
away from the field.

38:13.025 --> 38:16.483
I'm afraid my survival skills
have become dulled a bit.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.429
It could've worked.

38:28.640 --> 38:32.633
Jonathan, it was a great try.
It didn't work. So what?

38:32.711 --> 38:35.111
We're still gonna
get out of here.

38:36.148 --> 38:37.945
Perhaps you're right.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.016
Carry on, and all that.

38:40.085 --> 38:41.518
There you go.

38:45.123 --> 38:47.023
You called me Jonathan.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.925
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

38:51.496 --> 38:52.656
Quite.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.333
Well, then,
let's get on with it.

38:59.137 --> 39:00.263
Beg your pardon?

39:00.339 --> 39:01.328
Supper, man.

39:01.406 --> 39:04.603
The human body cannot function
without proper nourishment.

39:05.110 --> 39:07.010
I've collected
some rare vegetation...

39:07.079 --> 39:09.604
which I think
you'll find quite delectable.

39:10.182 --> 39:14.380
Very similar to that cultivated
in certain remote parts of Borneo.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.345
I was there, you know.

39:33.005 --> 39:35.098
Ho, ho, ho!

39:35.674 --> 39:42.436
♪ We wish you
a Merry Christmas ♪

39:42.514 --> 39:45.039
♪ And a Happy New Year ♪

39:45.183 --> 39:46.616
What is that?

39:46.685 --> 39:49.347
It's a Christmas tree.

39:49.421 --> 39:51.719
This is what you've been
spending all this time doing?

39:51.790 --> 39:54.816
Yeah. Pretty good,
huh? Absolutely defies description.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.691
Well, what's Christmas Eve
without a Christmas...

39:57.763 --> 40:01.494
Rick, don't move.
There's a bug in your hair.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.166
Sure there is.

40:03.235 --> 40:05.533
Oh, no, really.
It's a praying mantis.

40:06.305 --> 40:08.830
Look, guys,
I'm not going for it again.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.705
"Rick, there's a bug in your
pocket. Rick, there's a centipede.

40:11.777 --> 40:14.541
"Rick, there's a lizard."
Well, forget it.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.410
I don't believe it anymore.

40:23.388 --> 40:25.618
Now, where shall I put this?

40:45.143 --> 40:49.170
Perhaps, in an odd way, being
stranded here has been good for us.

40:49.414 --> 40:51.245
I, for one,
have been so intent...

40:51.316 --> 40:53.682
on getting everything done
that needed to get done...

40:53.785 --> 40:57.050
I'd completely lost track
of the spirit of the season.

40:57.389 --> 40:58.981
Yeah. Me, too.

40:59.524 --> 41:02.550
I'm really sorry you're gonna
be late for your family reunion.

41:03.662 --> 41:04.651
Ah...

41:05.797 --> 41:07.765
You'll still make Kwanza.

41:09.368 --> 41:10.596
Kwanza?

41:11.136 --> 41:12.398
Oh, yeah.

41:13.071 --> 41:17.098
It's the national Afro-American
holiday with its roots in Africa...

41:17.743 --> 41:22.203
celebrates among other things,
unity, creativity and faith.

41:23.248 --> 41:25.682
I was going to celebrate with
my whole family this year.

41:28.120 --> 41:31.817
Well, what do you say
to seconds all around?

41:36.128 --> 41:38.926
No, thanks, Higgins,
I'm really stuffed.

41:40.098 --> 41:43.226
Oh, no. I've been on a break
too long as it is.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.792
I think I'll go and try and tear
that voltage regulator apart...

41:45.871 --> 41:48.965
and see if we can get her started.
Anybody wanna hold a flashlight?

41:49.040 --> 41:50.405
I'll do it.

41:54.112 --> 41:56.080
How about you, Magnum?

41:56.148 --> 41:59.640
I'm trying to cut back on my
intake of roots and berries.

42:01.086 --> 42:03.748
It must be more
filling than I anticipated.

42:03.989 --> 42:06.287
The three of you ate
such meager portions.

42:08.927 --> 42:11.987
You don't think
it was a bit... bland?

42:12.631 --> 42:13.689
No.

42:15.167 --> 42:16.862
Higgins, look...

42:19.538 --> 42:22.098
I kind of want to...

42:23.675 --> 42:25.575
apologize for before.

42:27.512 --> 42:31.505
Apologize?
Yeah, you know. For being...

42:34.152 --> 42:35.642
insubordinate.

42:39.191 --> 42:41.557
It's quite understandable.

42:41.626 --> 42:44.925
I've seen it happen many times in
the heat of battle, on the front...

42:45.530 --> 42:47.464
especially during the holidays.

42:47.833 --> 42:50.768
Men are more lonely then,
more prone to snap.

42:52.304 --> 42:54.704
Your momentary lapse
is quite excusable.

42:55.507 --> 42:58.101
I will, of course,
keep it out of print.

42:59.177 --> 43:00.769
Out of print?

43:01.480 --> 43:02.845
My memoirs.

43:11.623 --> 43:15.787
I, of course, have spent many a
Christmas away from home and family.

43:17.329 --> 43:19.524
More times
than I care to remember...

43:19.598 --> 43:21.759
and in more places
than I care to remember.

43:22.400 --> 43:26.632
Forgotten battlefields, and
sometimes, even forgotten wars.

43:28.106 --> 43:32.099
I think being at war makes
Christmas all the more bittersweet.

43:33.812 --> 43:37.248
Peace on earth and goodwill
toward men and all that.

43:39.885 --> 43:41.614
I say, Magnum...

43:42.988 --> 43:45.718
the night NATO signal
for commence firing.

43:46.191 --> 43:48.056
Isn't that a...

43:51.363 --> 43:53.763
Red flare, yellow flare,
green flare.

43:53.865 --> 43:56.698
You don't suppose that
red flare out there is a...

43:58.169 --> 44:00.160
Come on. T.C.!

44:01.706 --> 44:04.607
Recon spotted a
fire on the west beach, sir.

44:04.676 --> 44:07.008
Damn! Some hotshot's
been bobbing in our barrel.

44:07.078 --> 44:08.545
Blast them, Jensen.

44:08.747 --> 44:10.772
But, sir, they're.
- Now!

44:13.251 --> 44:14.548
Yes, sir.

44:18.356 --> 44:20.586
Get ready, Thomas. Now!

44:31.703 --> 44:32.761
Come on, T.C.

44:32.837 --> 44:33.997
I'm only up to 6%%.

44:34.072 --> 44:36.540
I've only got enough juice
in the battery for one start.

44:36.608 --> 44:39.771
I don't know why everyone's
getting so hysterical.

44:39.844 --> 44:43.507
The likelihood of a direct hit
is so astronomically high that-

44:43.582 --> 44:44.810
Higgins!

44:45.116 --> 44:46.743
They're at yellow now.

44:46.818 --> 44:48.479
We're gonna die.

44:51.756 --> 44:52.916
T.C.!

44:53.124 --> 44:55.149
Thirteen percent!
That's close enough!

44:55.226 --> 44:57.091
No! We might melt
the engine down.

44:57.162 --> 44:59.460
Green. My God!

45:12.444 --> 45:13.570
Good shot.

45:17.749 --> 45:20.013
First round
was right on target, sir.

45:20.185 --> 45:21.550
Thank you, Ensign.

45:23.788 --> 45:24.982
Ensign?

45:27.792 --> 45:29.316
Merry Christmas.

45:29.928 --> 45:31.725
Merry Christmas, sir.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.195
Fifteen percent!
I'm gonna light it.

45:40.872 --> 45:42.897
Let's get the hell out of here!

46:12.303 --> 46:15.636
Well, looks like those kids are gonna
get to see Santa Claus after all.

46:17.642 --> 46:19.803
Or a reasonable facsimile.

46:20.845 --> 46:22.676
Merry Christmas, gentlemen.

46:23.214 --> 46:25.978
Merry Christmas, Higgins.
You too, Rick.

46:27.519 --> 46:29.180
Happy Kwanza to you, T.C.

46:29.254 --> 46:32.246
Hey, thanks.
Same to you guys.

46:32.524 --> 46:34.219
Aloha!

46:35.293 --> 46:36.555
Hey, T.C.?

46:36.861 --> 46:39.022
You remember what I said
about my cousin, Jenny?

46:39.097 --> 46:40.257
Yeah.

46:41.199 --> 46:42.632
Well, I was just kidding.
