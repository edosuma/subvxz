[Ollie] Lunch time!

00:33.920 --> 00:35.320
What you got, Ollie?

00:35.480 --> 00:38.480
Same as every day, Moon.
Cheddar cheese on white bread.

00:38.640 --> 00:39.879
You?

00:40.839 --> 00:42.000
Ta-dah!

00:42.120 --> 00:45.120
Today, I've got fried green
tomatoes with pickled bananas

00:45.280 --> 00:47.440
and peanut sauce on focaccia bread.

00:47.599 --> 00:50.280
A Lorraine sandwich!

00:50.440 --> 00:51.360
-Want some?
-Nope.

00:51.519 --> 00:52.839
-You sure?
-Sure.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.960
-It's a nice new taste.
-I don't like new tastes.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.480
So why do you call it
a Lorraine sandwich?

01:02.760 --> 01:04.280
What?

01:04.480 --> 01:07.920
You don't know who Lorraine is?

01:08.440 --> 01:12.280
Lorraine has an amazing food
and travel show on TV called

01:12.399 --> 01:14.479
<i>Seize the Adventure!</i>

01:14.640 --> 01:16.160
Look at this recipe!

01:16.280 --> 01:18.119
Way better than a boring cheese sandwich!

01:18.280 --> 01:19.360
Huh?

01:21.720 --> 01:23.039
[gasps]

01:24.520 --> 01:27.280
You should try something new, Ollie.

01:27.399 --> 01:29.880
Take your tongue on a food adventure.

01:32.720 --> 01:33.640
[gasps] I know!

01:33.759 --> 01:35.960
I'll cook you this recipe from Vietnam!

01:36.119 --> 01:38.039
And if you don't like it,
I'll never bother you

01:38.199 --> 01:41.839
about your boring sandwich
with yawn sauce ever again.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.080
Ever again? Deal!

01:44.920 --> 01:47.280
[clash of pots and pans]

01:48.559 --> 01:50.119
Huh, huh... Yeah.

01:50.280 --> 01:53.119
Um, I don't know
how to cook Vietnamese food.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.199
[sigh of relief]
Oh, well, I guess the deal is off!

01:56.360 --> 01:58.080
But I do know how to brainstorm!

01:58.240 --> 02:01.399
We'll just go to Vietnam and get some!

02:07.919 --> 02:09.000
Whoo!

02:10.000 --> 02:11.600
Whee!

02:19.920 --> 02:23.000
<i>Now arriving in Vietnam.</i>

02:29.079 --> 02:30.280
Aaah!

02:30.440 --> 02:33.480
Come on, let's check out the food carts!

02:34.400 --> 02:35.799
Whoa!

02:36.560 --> 02:39.880
Now, what great new food should you try?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.799
How about pineapple soup?

02:42.959 --> 02:46.079
But pineapple is a cold food
and soup is a hot food.

02:46.239 --> 02:48.239
I couldn't possibly eat them together.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.799
Then... how about that?

02:49.920 --> 02:51.720
Ugh! Too mixed up.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.160
You know I don't like my foods
to touch each other.

02:54.320 --> 02:58.679
That? They put special flowers
on it you can actually eat!

02:58.799 --> 03:01.480
Flowers? I don't eat flowers!

03:01.640 --> 03:04.600
No, Moon! No, no, no, no...

03:04.760 --> 03:06.239
Ow!

03:10.120 --> 03:13.959
It's so sad you're missing out
on all these great flavours.

03:14.079 --> 03:16.239
Yes. Yes, it is.

03:16.399 --> 03:18.600
-Oh, well! Let's go!
-No, Ollie.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.560
We agreed.
If you try something and don't like it,

03:21.720 --> 03:24.440
you can eat
your cheese sandwiches in peace.

03:24.600 --> 03:28.920
But you have to actually taste
something first!

03:29.079 --> 03:30.040
[Ollie sighs]

03:30.200 --> 03:31.840
Hmm.

03:31.959 --> 03:32.799
[Moon gasps]

03:32.959 --> 03:34.280
-I've got it!
-Aaah!

03:36.040 --> 03:38.840
We're going to go slow, OK, Ollie?

03:39.000 --> 03:42.079
-You like noodles, right?
-It depends.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.399
Will they be chewy or ooey

03:44.560 --> 03:48.200
or have sauce
or mysterious green bits on top?

03:48.320 --> 03:49.959
-No.
-Uh...

03:50.119 --> 03:53.160
Will they have some other food on top,

03:53.320 --> 03:56.679
or worse, hiding underneath?

03:58.280 --> 03:59.560
Nope.

03:59.720 --> 04:02.079
Then I guess I could try them.

04:02.239 --> 04:03.480
But if they're just noodles,

04:03.640 --> 04:05.880
what makes them
a Vietnamese food adventure?

04:06.040 --> 04:08.600
They're glass noodles!

04:08.760 --> 04:10.119
Ugh!

04:12.079 --> 04:13.440
Oh, don't worry, Ollie.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.560
They're not actually made of glass.

04:16.719 --> 04:19.079
They're called that
'cause you can see through them.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.880
Cool, huh?

04:21.039 --> 04:22.920
Now open up the hanger.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.680
Here comes the airplane! Zoom!

04:25.840 --> 04:27.039
Uh... Ugh!

04:27.200 --> 04:29.080
-Ollie!
-Sorry.

04:31.320 --> 04:33.240
Ollie! Stop being so squirmy!

04:33.400 --> 04:37.680
I can't help it! I...
I have to go to the bathroom!

04:44.680 --> 04:46.320
[Moon hums to herself]

04:51.479 --> 04:53.240
-Huh?
-Oh, pardon me.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.000
-Are you all right?
-Ollie?

04:55.159 --> 04:58.360
Me? Lorraine? I'm fine!

04:58.719 --> 05:00.440
Lorraine!

05:00.560 --> 05:03.120
[Moon gasps] Hi, Lorraine! Hello!
I'm Moon, your biggest fan.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.599
You're so adventurous
and amazing and I love you!

05:06.719 --> 05:09.719
She is, you are, I don't. Hi. I'm Ollie.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.039
Gasp!

05:11.159 --> 05:14.039
<i>I find adoring fans all over the world,</i>

05:14.200 --> 05:18.400
<i>just dying to see me! Lorraine!</i>

05:19.120 --> 05:21.719
<i>-What brings you to Vietnam?</i>
<i>-A plane.</i>

05:21.840 --> 05:24.440
<i>-Well, you did!</i>
<i>-I did.</i>

05:24.560 --> 05:26.960
Me! Lorraine!

05:27.120 --> 05:30.000
Well, have you "seized the adventure"?

05:30.159 --> 05:33.560
Tell me, what foods
have you tried so far?

05:33.719 --> 05:35.159
<i>Um...</i>

05:35.320 --> 05:38.640
<i>Actually, Ollie doesn't like</i>
<i>trying new foods.</i>

05:38.800 --> 05:40.479
<i>Double gasp!</i>

05:40.599 --> 05:42.200
Well, I can fix that.

05:42.320 --> 05:46.440
You two just come along
and be guest stars on my TV show!

05:46.560 --> 05:49.359
Stars? Oh, wow!

05:49.520 --> 05:50.800
Yeesh!

05:50.919 --> 05:54.840
Ollie, what you need is inspiration,

05:55.000 --> 05:59.320
watching other people taking
food-tasting risks. Right, Moon?

05:59.479 --> 06:01.719
Yes! I can take food-tasting risks!

06:01.880 --> 06:04.200
And I can just watch? Phew!

06:07.080 --> 06:07.919
Yum!

06:08.039 --> 06:09.960
<i>The delicious, the exotic...</i>

06:10.120 --> 06:12.240
<i>deep-fried river weed!</i>

06:12.599 --> 06:14.680
<i>Should I taste it... yet again?</i>

06:15.039 --> 06:17.200
Or do you want to be the star?

06:17.359 --> 06:20.039
Oh! Me, me, me! Wow!

06:20.200 --> 06:22.280
-This looks...
-Green?

06:22.440 --> 06:24.280
Mysterious? Worrisome?

06:24.400 --> 06:25.799
Interesting!

06:27.799 --> 06:29.560
And it tastes great!

06:29.719 --> 06:31.599
You're a real adventurer, Moon.

06:31.760 --> 06:34.919
Just like me! Lorraine!

06:35.080 --> 06:37.240
-Your turn, Ollie!
-<i>Ollie's not here.</i>

06:37.400 --> 06:40.000
<i>Please leave a message. Beep!</i>

06:40.159 --> 06:42.280
<i>Don't worry. I'll take care of this.</i>

06:42.400 --> 06:44.840
<i>Me! Lorraine!</i>

06:45.919 --> 06:49.400
All you need to do is pick
some river weed for yourself.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.840
Once you see where it comes
from, it won't seem so scary.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.560
What a great idea, huh, Ollie?

06:54.719 --> 06:57.599
Oh, we are never
going to forget this day!

06:57.760 --> 07:02.080
-That's what I'm afraid of.
-Look! There! River weed!

07:02.200 --> 07:03.039
Now, who wants to

07:03.159 --> 07:06.880
<i>"seize the adventure" and go after it?</i>

07:07.039 --> 07:09.919
<i>I'll let one of my guests</i>
<i>have the honour.</i>

07:10.359 --> 07:11.640
Ollie?

07:13.280 --> 07:15.400
-Yikes!
-Actually,

07:15.560 --> 07:18.239
Ollie's afraid of water.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.200
-But I'll seize the adventure!
-Really, Moon?

07:21.479 --> 07:24.840
Yes! I want you to know
the joy of trying new foods!

07:25.000 --> 07:28.479
I'll do whatever it takes,
just like Lorraine!

07:28.599 --> 07:31.080
Whoa! Yipes! Oops!

07:34.400 --> 07:35.760
I'm OK! Whoops!

07:35.880 --> 07:36.719
[Ollie gasps]

07:36.840 --> 07:38.039
So amazing!

07:38.200 --> 07:41.239
So heroic! So adventurous!

07:41.359 --> 07:44.280
Like me! Lorraine!

07:46.000 --> 07:48.840
And here's... the river weed...

07:49.000 --> 07:52.960
Oh... Doesn't it look yummy, Ollie?

07:53.120 --> 07:54.320
Uh...

07:54.960 --> 07:56.960
Right! Let's cook it up!

08:00.000 --> 08:02.080
River weed makes a great dried snack

08:02.239 --> 08:04.000
or a yummy stir-fry like this!

08:04.120 --> 08:04.960
Now watch

08:05.400 --> 08:08.440
<i>as Ollie takes his first bite!</i>

08:09.359 --> 08:11.080
<i>You know, it still looks pretty hot.</i>

08:11.200 --> 08:14.120
<i>Maybe I should wait till</i>
<i>it cools down for a few minutes,</i>

08:14.280 --> 08:16.159
or an hour, or forever!

08:16.280 --> 08:19.200
-Oops!
-Hey! Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

08:23.760 --> 08:25.479

Yah! Yah!

08:29.440 --> 08:30.520
Oh!

08:33.720 --> 08:37.439
No way! It's raining...
cheese sandwiches?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.319
My cheese sandwiches!

08:39.480 --> 08:42.799
Wait. These are <i>your </i>cheese sandwiches?

08:42.959 --> 08:44.360
Oh, sure!

08:44.720 --> 08:47.439
Well, you can't eat Mexican cactus

08:47.600 --> 08:49.760
and roasted crickets all the time!

08:49.920 --> 08:51.040
[embarrassed laugh]

08:51.600 --> 08:56.160
-But there are so many of them!
-Oh! You might as well know.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.920
I eat these a lot! The truth is,

08:59.040 --> 09:02.439
I love helping other people
be more adventurous eaters, but...

09:02.920 --> 09:05.160
You find it hard to try new things?

09:05.319 --> 09:08.800
-Mmm-hmm.
-You do? I can't believe it!

09:08.959 --> 09:12.000
-You? Lorraine?
-Yep.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.280
Me. Lorraine.

09:14.439 --> 09:17.959
I'm sorry I'm not the hero
you thought I was, Moon.

09:18.120 --> 09:21.959
But you are! You're so inspiring!

09:22.079 --> 09:23.520
-I am?
-Sure!

09:23.720 --> 09:26.400
You ate the river weed,
and braved the river,

09:26.560 --> 09:28.680
and saved me from the runaway fruit.

09:28.839 --> 09:31.720
Actually, if you can be
that brave for me, then...

09:31.839 --> 09:33.680
[Ollie takes a big breath]

09:35.760 --> 09:37.839
You're trying the river weed?

09:38.920 --> 09:41.959
To be more like my hero, Moon.

09:42.079 --> 09:44.000
Wow! So you liked it?

09:44.199 --> 09:46.880
-You actually liked it?
-The river weed?

09:47.040 --> 09:49.040
Oh, no! No!

09:49.199 --> 09:53.600

and that's a start! Right, Lorraine?

09:53.720 --> 09:56.439
-How about you try it, too?
-Gulp!

I don't think so, Moon.
I'm trying something new.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.920
Cheese and tomato sandwich!

Not bad. A bit weird! But I tried it!
