WEBVTT

00:59.977 --> 01:03.522
- I was working
in my office on 138th Street.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.986
Mostly fixing up
banged-up guys,

01:09.069 --> 01:11.196
like myself,
from the Great War.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.948
See? Beautiful.

01:13.031 --> 01:16.660
All from injuries
the world was happy to forget.

01:17.327 --> 01:21.081
Fixing faces, lifting spirits,
singing songs.

01:22.040 --> 01:26.878
- Peanuts

01:27.462 --> 01:29.756
- I left my eye in France.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.218
And I was constantly
on probation

01:33.302 --> 01:34.344
with the medical board

01:34.428 --> 01:35.887
for trying to make
new medicines.

01:35.971 --> 01:38.932
I mean, we needed medicines
that didn't exist yet

01:39.016 --> 01:43.103
just to get through the day,
with the pain and the nerves.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.897
I hope this is a better pill.
That's all I'm saying.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.024
I hope you're right.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.944
- Some worked better
than others.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.572
This is my second of the day.

01:55.991 --> 01:57.159
And I feel great.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.369
Victor, you wanna try one?

01:59.828 --> 02:01.621
Yeah. I'll try the new one
next week.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.207
All right.
That gives you zing.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.336
Put your pants on, Burt.
I repaired 'em for you.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.004
Are you all right?

02:09.087 --> 02:10.464
- Because
of my war injuries,

02:10.547 --> 02:13.342
I had a back brace I hated.

02:13.425 --> 02:15.427
-They're gonna put you away

02:15.510 --> 02:16.845
if they don't close
this place down.

02:16.928 --> 02:17.929
- That's not helpful,
Shirley.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.848
Experimental medicine.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.475
-- You look good.

02:21.558 --> 02:22.768
-How's the infection?
-All right.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.311
Good, good, good, good, good.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.520
And I got the message.

02:25.604 --> 02:26.980
No need to pay yet.

02:27.064 --> 02:28.482
- Burt,
you got messages.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.859
Your parents called.
They can't make the holiday.

02:30.942 --> 02:33.320
Herb Getz called
about the ear drops.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.782
And Harold Woodman called.
Meet him at this address.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.950
Walk right in. Urgent.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.129
- I worked
with an attorney,

02:51.213 --> 02:54.174
my best friend from the war,
Harold Woodman.

02:54.883 --> 02:55.884
Hey, Burt.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.428
- What is going on?
What is this place?

02:58.512 --> 03:00.555
-It's a very important case.
-Yeah?

03:00.639 --> 03:02.099
-Pays very handsomely.
-Nice.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.225
We have a lot of back bills.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.519
People depend on us,
our business.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.480
Most importantly, it's very
meaningful to both you and I.

03:08.563 --> 03:09.689
Meaningful how?

03:09.773 --> 03:11.191
Well, you care about
the annual gala,

03:11.274 --> 03:12.317
-don't you?
-Yeah.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.027
And you always say

03:14.111 --> 03:16.196
it's important for us vets
to have reunions,

03:16.279 --> 03:17.739
-to be remembered.
-It is.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.449
And you say
it's great medicine for us

03:19.533 --> 03:21.535
to get together and sing.
Don't you say that?

03:21.618 --> 03:22.911
Where's this going?

03:23.328 --> 03:25.247
It's going
to a particular procedure,

03:25.330 --> 03:28.333
and I know how you prefer
some procedures over others.

03:28.417 --> 03:29.543
Just tell me what it is.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.044
What...
What kind of procedure?

03:31.753 --> 03:33.505
What are you doing
with these flowers?

03:34.047 --> 03:36.049
Dinner date with Beatrice.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.385
-Dinner date with Beatrice?
-Yes.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.887
-So disappointing.
-She's my wife.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.140
Is he all right
to perform the procedure?

03:45.434 --> 03:48.437
Yes.
He... He is. It's okay.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.729
-He's not gonna do it.
-He's gonna do it.

03:49.813 --> 03:50.939
-Calm down.
-Who is this?

03:51.690 --> 03:54.025
This is Liz Meekins, Burt.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.236
Meekins? As in, relation to...

03:56.736 --> 04:00.157
He's my father. I know
you admire him very much.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.909
-Oh, my God. Yes.
-We both did. Do.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.202
I really do.

04:04.286 --> 04:08.457
That's why he's gonna speak
at our reunion this year.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.333
Very nice to meet you.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.210
Are we meeting
your father here?

04:12.294 --> 04:13.420
Let her finish, Burt.

04:14.212 --> 04:17.382
My father
came back yesterday on a boat.

04:18.049 --> 04:20.802
Okay. He goes to Europe
on business, right?

04:20.886 --> 04:21.928
Did he catch a bug
or something?

04:22.012 --> 04:23.096
I'll look at him. Where is he?

04:23.180 --> 04:24.306
You should see him.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.016
Yeah. Come on. Let's go.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.810
This place is gorgeous.
Look at it.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.770
So, where... where is, uh,

04:30.854 --> 04:33.857
the good General
"Quiet and Still" Bill?

04:39.613 --> 04:40.739
- Excuse me.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.658
My allergies
are terrible today.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.911
I wake up, it's in my sinus,

04:45.994 --> 04:47.913
and it's the whole day.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.456
I don't know
what you're doing,

04:49.539 --> 04:50.540
and I don't wanna know
what you're doing.

04:52.792 --> 04:56.213
You have two hours
until the embalmer comes.

04:57.214 --> 05:00.008
What happened? He was
gonna speak at the gala.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.595
-You will help me, won't you?

05:03.678 --> 05:05.388
I'm not buying that he died
of natural causes.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.098
He was a very healthy man.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.017
No one in my family
agrees with me.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.435
They're all wrong.
They're all liars.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.062
I want an autopsy.

05:12.521 --> 05:13.772
- That's correct.
It is your right.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.357
Your father died intestate.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.234
You're the next of kin.
I read the papers.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.237
I hate autopsies, Harold.
You know that.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.197
We have to do it, Burt.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.700
Bill "Quiet and Still" Meekins
is the reason we met.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.160
He formed our regiment.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.413
How did a man like this
end up dead?

05:30.497 --> 05:31.748
You're telling me
it's suspicious?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.833
- Yes, I'm telling you
it's suspicious.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.670
Will you please sing with me?

05:36.753 --> 05:37.963
He said that
you used to sing with him

05:38.046 --> 05:39.047
when you were at war.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.382
He enjoyed it so much.

05:41.216 --> 05:44.636
-Precious memories
-- Memories

05:45.262 --> 05:49.224
- Unseen angels

05:49.307 --> 05:55.480
Sent from somewhere to my soul

05:55.564 --> 05:57.357
-- Hurry up.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.317
You only have two hours

05:59.401 --> 06:01.570
to do whatever it is
you're gonna do.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.530
All right.
You have to do the autopsy,

06:03.613 --> 06:05.865
and immediately after,
meet me at Minters Restaurant.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.033
I need to know what you find.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.577
Why did she say two hours?

06:08.660 --> 06:10.078
Because we're
in the mortician.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.580
They're gonna put him
in the ground.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.083
Minters Restaurant,
after- 00.

06:15.625 --> 06:16.626
You've gotta get him
out of here.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.877
Yeah, we should
get going, Burt.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.214
Harold? I don't know
what you think you're doin'.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.300
Liz, excuse me. Hello.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.428
You got a dead white man
in a box.

06:27.429 --> 06:28.597
Not even a casket.

06:29.764 --> 06:33.184
Important man,
in a pine box of old wood.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.228
Doesn't even have a top on it.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.606
-His daughter's cryin'.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.399
Who do you think
is gonna get in trouble here?

06:39.482 --> 06:40.984
-The Black man, that's who.
-Milton.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.694
Right now we need to get him,

06:42.777 --> 06:44.863
our leader,
who founded our regiment,

06:44.946 --> 06:46.656
into the truck.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.450
Do the autopsy.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.370
Meet me at Minters Restaurant
immediately after.

06:52.454 --> 06:53.496
-Got it.
-I need to know.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.581
I need to know what you found.

06:54.664 --> 06:55.665
Okay.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.916
-Minters Restaurant at- 00.
-Milton. Milton.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.252
- Please be careful.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.254
-- It's got a bum wheel.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.756
-- That's not careful.
-Milton.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.342
This is why
you'll never drive my car.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.135
The embalmer
is coming for this.

07:07.218 --> 07:10.472
You better be here. Two hours.

07:12.641 --> 07:13.725
- You remember Burt,
don't you?

07:14.601 --> 07:16.728
-Of course.
-- Irma St. Clair.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.813
-Hello, Burt.
-Hello, Irma.

07:19.481 --> 07:20.690
- Don't be nervous.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.567
I do at least
two autopsies a month.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.445
I've done two autopsies
my whole life.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.322
One to prove
I didn't leave a clamp

07:27.405 --> 07:28.573
on someone's small intestine,

07:28.657 --> 07:30.075
the other to remove a clamp
I did leave

07:30.158 --> 07:31.409
on someone's small intestine.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.995
Now we know you're good
with small intestines, Burt.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.080
Thank you.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.251
You know, you and Burt should
get coffee sometimes, Irma.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.921
Maybe you and Irma
should get coffee sometime.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.214
- We're friends, Milton.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.007
You know, Irma,

07:46.091 --> 07:48.426
his wife wouldn't stand up
for him to her family.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.262
They haven't lived together
in over a year.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.390
That is my situation. Not now.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.808
I just wanna see you happy.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.810
Dead man makes you realize

07:56.893 --> 07:58.812
time is short
and love is real,

07:58.895 --> 08:00.063
if you know what it is.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.945
-What's going on here?
-Autopsy. Paperwork.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.116
The police are waiting
for this body

08:11.199 --> 08:12.242
to return to the mortuary.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.496
The sooner we start,
the sooner he's out.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.165
These two men
need to leave immediately.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.501
- They're veterans.
They served their country.

08:21.584 --> 08:22.585
Go wait at McGee's.

08:22.669 --> 08:23.795
We'll be downstairs
at McGee's.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.046
At McGee's.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.882
Irma's Portuguese.
That's different.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.057
I didn't know
you were Portuguese.

08:37.809 --> 08:38.810
I'm not.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.521
Do you wanna start this
or shall I?

08:42.689 --> 08:44.733
Uh, just emotional
because I knew him.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.278
You can just sign this
if you want.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.404
No, no, no, no, no.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.740
-That's what Harold needs.
-I... I can help.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.534
He was such a kind man.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.872
There we go.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.709
Oh, God.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.170
-- Mm.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.425
Um, didn't ask
how you were doing.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.595
My man left.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.182
This kind of thing
happens every day.

09:18.475 --> 09:19.559
- I'm sorry.

09:19.642 --> 09:20.894
- It's fine.

09:20.977 --> 09:24.898
True love is based on choice,
not need.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.649
Do you need your wife

09:27.066 --> 09:29.194
or do you choose your wife?

09:29.277 --> 09:30.570
Well, can't it be both?

09:30.653 --> 09:33.239
No. The second one is
the one that truly matters.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.033
At the end of the day, it is.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.368
Choice matters over need.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.622
I don't like to be alone.

09:40.705 --> 09:41.873
Ah.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.082
That sounds like "need."

09:44.083 --> 09:46.753
I'm opening up the stomach.
Look at that.

09:47.879 --> 09:50.340
- Oh, yeah.
That's an unusual color.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.343
-Something...
-Yeah.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.137
Given to him
over a period of time.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.097
-Hmm.
-It's hard to tell how long.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.226
- Hmm.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.936
He just got back from Europe.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.731
I'll close him up
and take more blood samples.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.107
I'll have more news
for you tomorrow.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.484
I take it you're still
at the same office?

10:09.567 --> 10:10.568
Yeah.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.740
Harold says you deserve
a better circumstance,

10:15.824 --> 10:17.826
but you allowed yourself
to be corrupted.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.911
He says you followed
the wrong God home.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.789
What? "Corrupted"?

10:22.872 --> 10:25.416
"Followed the wrong God home"?
Why doesn't he say that to me?

10:25.500 --> 10:27.585
-What does that even mean?
-I don't know.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.797
Maybe you spent
enthusiasms and urgencies

10:30.880 --> 10:31.881
you didn't know
you were wasting

10:31.965 --> 10:33.383
until it was too late.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.135
You ended up without a chair
by the time the music ends,

10:37.053 --> 10:38.054
even in your own home.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.015
- We need this room.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.184
- That's perfect,
'cause we were just leaving.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.688
Liz said to meet her
after- 00 at Minters.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.357
Right. But I wanna
talk to you about Irma.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.776
Oh, the reason
I pushed that, Burt,

10:51.860 --> 10:53.236
is because
I wanna see you happy.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.404
And I'm your friend.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.614
My friend who thinks
I'm corrupted somehow,

10:56.698 --> 10:57.991
yet doesn't have the guts
or decency

10:58.074 --> 10:59.200
to tell it to my face.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.202
You don't wanna
hear that to your face.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.496
You've got flowers
for your wife

11:03.580 --> 11:05.748
who won't let you live
in your own apartment.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.626
Explain the word "corrupted"

11:08.710 --> 11:11.337
or the term "following
the wrong God home."

11:11.421 --> 11:12.755
It's your in-laws, Burt.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.549
They hate
that we work together,

11:14.632 --> 11:16.050
let alone that we're friends.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.135
Well, I don't listen

11:17.218 --> 11:18.761
to any of that Park Avenue
garbage from them.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.305
Yes, you do.
You care a little bit.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.931
And all it takes
is a little bit, Burt.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.016
Then they got you.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.935
Like that drop of blood from
the cut you got from the war

11:26.019 --> 11:27.145
before I stabbed that German.

11:27.228 --> 11:30.064
Those cuts clouded your eye,
and guess what,

11:30.148 --> 11:31.441
you lost the eye forever.

11:36.779 --> 11:39.032
Welcome to Minters, gentlemen.
Table for two?

11:39.115 --> 11:40.533
Uh, we're actually
meeting someone...

11:40.617 --> 11:42.535
-Uh-huh.
-...a tall woman, blonde...

11:43.536 --> 11:44.662
-Yes.
-...serious face.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.039
Yes. Right this way.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.544
Wait. She was here.
I don't know what happened.

11:51.794 --> 11:52.921
-She was...

11:53.004 --> 11:54.005
Right here.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.757
- Miss Meekins.
- There she goes, pal.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.216
- Miss... Wait.
Miss Meekins.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.054
Miss Meekins. Miss Meekins.

12:01.596 --> 12:02.597
We did what you asked.

12:02.680 --> 12:03.681
We found something suspicious,

12:03.765 --> 12:04.766
just like you thought.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.142
- I can't do it. I'm sorry.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.602
-What...

12:07.685 --> 12:10.355
I spoke to a personal friend,
Mr... Mr. Voze.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.357
He said I have to be careful.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.901
-Who? Did he scare you?
-He said it was dangerous.

12:14.984 --> 12:15.985
Wait. Miss Meekins,
wait a second.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.070
I just need to drop it.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.154
- Come off the street.
Come on.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.238
-You knew my father.
-Yes, yes.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.323
-And you knew my father.
-We did.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.407
We loved your father. Yes.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.492
And you know
what he used to say is,

12:22.575 --> 12:23.743
he used to say
you can't run from fear.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.119
You can't let
fear chase you around.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.705
I know that I seem afraid,

12:27.789 --> 12:29.248
and I shouldn't be
because Mr. Voze,

12:29.332 --> 12:30.333
he was just cautioning me.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.460
He wasn't... He meant well.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.670
He's a friend of the family.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.879
What did you find?

12:35.672 --> 12:37.674
We believe that
he might have been poisoned.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.217
Do you know why?

12:39.300 --> 12:40.927
Is somebody watching me?
I can't...

12:41.010 --> 12:42.136
- It's okay. It...

12:42.220 --> 12:43.638
I don't know
if I can talk about this.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.724
They have interests
in an alliance,

12:46.808 --> 12:47.976
and he knew that.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.561
But he wasn't gonna
go along with it.

12:50.645 --> 12:53.314
He knew something.
He saw something terrible.

12:53.731 --> 12:54.732
He did.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.526
And they knew
he was gonna tell.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.860
Tell what? What did he see?

12:57.944 --> 12:58.945
- It's dangerous.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.655
-I think that...

13:00.738 --> 13:02.615
-- Miss Meekins!

13:02.699 --> 13:04.158
-Oh, my God! Miss Meekins!

13:06.828 --> 13:08.705
These two, they did it.
Right there.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.540
-Miss Meekins!
-- She's dead.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.458
-Ow!
-- They did it.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.543
-Right there.
-- You're lying!

13:13.626 --> 13:14.627
- These two right there.
They did.

13:14.711 --> 13:15.712
These two guys. Right there.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.796
No! You did it!
You pushed her!

13:16.879 --> 13:18.297
-- They killed that woman.
-I saw you push her!

13:18.381 --> 13:19.590
- They killed her!
- I saw you, sir!

13:19.674 --> 13:20.675
-They did it.
-I saw it.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.218
I'm an attorney.
This is a doctor.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.302
- Them two.
I saw 'em do it.

13:23.386 --> 13:24.387
She hired us.
This is our client.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.471
Look what he's got
in his hand.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.390
-He's got her purse!
-He's got her purse.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.683
You killed her
and took her purse!

13:28.766 --> 13:30.685
No. I saw you. You pushed her.

13:30.768 --> 13:31.894
-I'm an attorney...

13:31.978 --> 13:33.312
No, no, no! He's...

13:33.896 --> 13:35.106
- Get off!

13:35.189 --> 13:37.108
- Citizen's arrest!
Citizen's arrest!

13:37.191 --> 13:39.110
We'll make a citizen's arrest!

13:40.737 --> 13:42.739
-- Shoot 'em!

13:43.448 --> 13:44.574
Get them!
Those two, right there!

13:44.907 --> 13:45.950
- Stop!

13:46.034 --> 13:47.035
Stop!

13:49.871 --> 13:50.872
- Cowards!

13:52.665 --> 13:55.334
- That poor girl. Oh, God.

13:55.418 --> 13:56.586
- Come on. Let's go.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.795
- Behind those cars!

14:09.140 --> 14:10.183
-That's the man.
-- You're not driving.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.267
I'm driving.
We talked about this.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.727
-That's him.
-- Stay organized.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.146
We're an organization.
Stay organized.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.230
- They won't get away.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.399
We'll keep an eye out for 'em
right here.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.568
How the hell did they
follow us over here?

14:27.116 --> 14:28.534
Come on, come on.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.037
- God, this brace.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.121
- Hey, hey!

14:33.081 --> 14:34.082
Hey!

14:36.834 --> 14:38.169
I think they're
still watching us.

14:38.753 --> 14:39.754
You think?

14:40.671 --> 14:41.672
I think so.

14:42.465 --> 14:45.593
- Holy shit.
What fresh hell is this?

14:46.094 --> 14:47.303
You don't get here

14:47.386 --> 14:50.139
without things
starting a long time ago.

14:56.687 --> 14:59.816
You want me to go
to our favorite tree...

15:02.693 --> 15:06.364
and get bark
in the Argonne Forest

15:06.447 --> 15:09.700
where they are
blowing people up?

15:10.827 --> 15:12.537
It will be honorable,
glorious.

15:12.620 --> 15:13.621
Good for the family.

15:16.958 --> 15:19.669
But it... it's good, Burt.
It's good.

15:21.295 --> 15:24.048
You'll fit in better
when you have more medals.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.800
- You'll fit in
on Park Avenue.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.344
People respect
military service.

15:28.845 --> 15:29.887
I could be killed.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.931
We cannot think that way.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.391
Of course you won't be killed.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.311
- Ah, Beatrice.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.816
I didn't come
all the way over here

15:41.899 --> 15:44.443
to be talked to
like a damn dog.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.154
It's a crime against the flag.

15:46.237 --> 15:49.073
I don't think they have
the ability to possess

15:49.157 --> 15:51.159
the admiration
or the confidence

15:51.242 --> 15:52.326
to wear the uniform.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.578
Who are we talking about?

15:53.661 --> 15:56.122
One of these crackers
get in my way,

15:56.205 --> 15:57.665
I'mma shoot 'em in the back.

15:57.748 --> 16:00.042
Well, we know you even
like this even more.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.919
I was done talking to you.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.337
You'll never be done
talking to me.

16:03.421 --> 16:04.422
- That's enough, Sergeant.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.674
Yes, sir, General Meekins.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.217
You don't need to be
involved anymore.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.385
Attitude doesn't help.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.596
That's why
I wanted to bring you on

16:11.679 --> 16:12.680
as a medical officer,
Bernstein.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.515
Berendsen, sir.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.559
I'm sorry.
This is Mr. Woodman.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.685
Got a situation here

16:17.768 --> 16:19.312
that I thought you might be
able to help with.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.855
What situation, sir?

16:20.938 --> 16:22.440
- Mr. Woodman,
why don't you tell him

16:22.523 --> 16:23.816
why you're here
in the stockade.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.526
Why are we in a stockade?

16:25.610 --> 16:27.028
Insubordination.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.487
Were you insubordinate?

16:28.571 --> 16:29.864
-- Yes.
-Why?

16:29.947 --> 16:32.909
They gave us Jim Crow officers
like that knucklehead.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.535
But we refuse to continue

16:34.619 --> 16:36.996
till they've replaced him
with somebody good.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.706
Someone decent and respectful.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.417
Is that supposed
to be me, sir?

16:41.500 --> 16:42.919
That is you, Berendsen.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.545
- I mean,
the people you meet

16:44.629 --> 16:46.172
in these circumstances

16:46.255 --> 16:48.007
of tremendous stress

16:48.090 --> 16:50.593
are bonded to you for life.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.094
Are you the kind of doctor

16:52.178 --> 16:53.638
that's gonna leave me
bleeding out

16:53.721 --> 16:54.805
and I'll have to shoot
in the back?

16:54.889 --> 16:56.015
Because let me tell you,

16:56.849 --> 16:58.768
the officers that they had,

16:58.851 --> 17:00.603
they didn't care
whether we lived or died.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.855
I am not gonna
let anybody bleed out,

17:02.939 --> 17:04.982
and I do not wanna
get shot in the back.

17:05.066 --> 17:07.068
I am the son of a mechanic
from Elmira.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.152
I am married.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.654
I'm half Catholic,
half Jewish.

17:09.737 --> 17:12.490
I'm a doctor. I have
a practice on Park Avenue.

17:12.573 --> 17:15.576
And I think that my in-laws
sent me here to get rid of me.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.372
Well, that all sounds
pretty good, except that...

17:20.790 --> 17:23.459
in-laws part, but maybe
that's why I can trust you.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.382
So, we'll make a pact.

17:30.675 --> 17:33.636
You see to it
that we won't die.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.721
And I'll make sure

17:36.639 --> 17:38.015
you won't get killed.

17:40.351 --> 17:41.602
We'll look out for each other.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.605
Harold Thaddeus Woodman.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.274
Bertram Berendsen.

17:46.357 --> 17:48.526
-Welcome to the 369.
-Thank you.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.403
Finally, that's what
I've been looking for.

17:50.486 --> 17:51.487
Just some respect.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.657
Now let's go deal with this
unfortunate uniform situation.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.618
Yeah, let's go deal
with this uniform shit.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.745
- Welcome to my army.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.706
Why are we wearing
French uniforms?

18:02.540 --> 18:03.958
The American soldiers,

18:04.041 --> 18:05.710
they don't wanna
be seen with us.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.713
It's disgraceful. I fought
to create this regiment

18:08.796 --> 18:11.048
in the spirit
of kindness and unity.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.133
Hope to see you

18:12.216 --> 18:14.302
on the other side of
the Argonne in good shape.

18:14.385 --> 18:15.469
God be with you.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.811
-- I saved Harold.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.396
He saved me.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.858
And there was this French lady
saving both of us.

18:44.165 --> 18:45.166
Give me the rest...

18:45.833 --> 18:46.834
Do not throw that away.

18:46.917 --> 18:47.918
Why do you want to keep it?

18:48.002 --> 18:49.003
It's unsanitary.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.129
It's none of your business.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.672
- Et vous ne portez pas
de bonnet en plus!

18:51.756 --> 18:53.132
-Comment?
-Vous ne portez pas de bonnet!

18:53.215 --> 18:54.300
Get out of here!

18:55.468 --> 18:56.469
Get out of here.

18:56.552 --> 18:57.595
- Oh la la!

19:15.196 --> 19:16.280
Croyez-moi.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.666
Stop this atrocity!

19:27.875 --> 19:28.876
It's indecent...

19:28.959 --> 19:29.960
...criminal...

19:30.044 --> 19:31.045
...and you are blaspheming...

19:31.128 --> 19:32.505
...by keeping this bloody metal!

19:32.588 --> 19:34.215
-She's blaspheming?
-- Oui.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.424
I'm blaspheming?

19:35.508 --> 19:36.592
Oui.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.512
The metal was obscene when it went in.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.473
I redeem it when I take it out.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.892
You prefer to keep it all hidden.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.686
It insults God...

19:47.853 --> 19:48.979
...and the families
of the dead and the wounded.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.606
No, she's right.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.650
No, she's right.

19:52.733 --> 19:53.734
Merci.

19:53.818 --> 19:55.694
She can keep this bloody metal.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.113
-- Quoi?
-Merci.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.656
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.199
-She's right.
-You see?

20:00.282 --> 20:01.283
-Vous voyez! Allez.
-Allez.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.868
Tout le monde! Tout le monde!

20:02.952 --> 20:04.161
Du calme! Du calme!

20:04.245 --> 20:05.454
Take it easy, Harold.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.539
- Il a raison!
Vous voyez!

20:06.622 --> 20:07.748
- Vous voyez!
Allez. Allez.

20:07.832 --> 20:10.543
How dare you!

20:10.626 --> 20:11.919
Oh, my God!

20:12.378 --> 20:14.797
-- Ça suffit.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.549
I don't know
what is happening.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.051
- Liberté pour
nous tous. Arrêtez de mentir!

20:19.135 --> 20:23.055
- Liberté pour nous tous.
Arrêtez de mentir!

20:23.472 --> 20:24.974
Liberté...

20:27.643 --> 20:28.644
Mr. Woodman,

20:28.727 --> 20:30.187
I believe I owe you
my gratitude.

20:30.980 --> 20:31.981
Oh, you speak English?

20:32.314 --> 20:34.191
-Yes.
-I thought you were French.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.609
I'm Valerie Bandenberg.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.405
-You're not French?
-No.

20:40.656 --> 20:41.991
May I buy you a drink?

20:42.616 --> 20:44.410
Yes.
We... We can do that here?

20:44.493 --> 20:46.787
-I can.
-We can... We can drink here?

20:46.871 --> 20:47.872
Harold!

20:47.955 --> 20:50.124
-What the hell are you doing?
-Young man!

20:50.207 --> 20:51.208
Where you goin'?

20:51.292 --> 20:52.710
- Oh,
he's in safe hands with me.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.921
If those Mississippi crackers
could see you now...

20:56.005 --> 20:57.798
What happened to the pact?

20:58.466 --> 21:00.134
I lost an eye here.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.065
A woman who smokes a pipe.

21:18.152 --> 21:19.236
Are you intimidated?

21:20.029 --> 21:21.447
A little bit right now.

21:28.454 --> 21:29.997
- When you see someone,

21:30.498 --> 21:32.500
and you really see them,

21:34.084 --> 21:37.338
you see the kid
that used to be them.

21:38.797 --> 21:42.259
You see the part of them
that's vulnerable.

21:43.677 --> 21:46.347
Harold and I had that kind
of seeing each other

21:46.430 --> 21:47.640
right from the start.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.727
Well, now that the war
is over...

21:55.314 --> 21:56.982
I just want to be a person.
You know?

21:57.066 --> 21:58.609
I just want to walk around

21:59.401 --> 22:01.153
-free...
-- Mm.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.988
...as a person. Just...

22:04.323 --> 22:05.908
Just living my life.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.160
Here in Europe.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.205
That's the ticket.
Just live and be free.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.958
I highly recommend it.
I've walked around Europe.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.835
It's done wonders for me.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.088
- Without even
too many words,

22:19.171 --> 22:22.049
I mean, she's looking
right into your soul.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.552
-Yeah, you wear it well.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.680
Both our lives
were in the balance

22:27.763 --> 22:29.640
before God. Right there.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.313
Can I ask you something?

22:36.772 --> 22:37.773
- Mm.

22:38.649 --> 22:40.150
What do you do
with the bloody shrapnel

22:40.234 --> 22:41.735
that you take from our bodies?

22:42.194 --> 22:44.029
I can't give you that
for nothing.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.240
You have to trade me
something.

22:46.323 --> 22:47.866
You don't get that for free.

22:48.701 --> 22:49.702
Trade you?

22:50.160 --> 22:52.496
Okay. What does it cost?

22:53.497 --> 22:54.999
Something beautiful.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.793
Something to live for.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.838
I'm looking at that right now.

23:08.345 --> 23:11.181
I already gave you pieces of
metal shrapnel from my body.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.892
You know, actually,
I took a lot more metal

23:13.976 --> 23:15.394
from your friend's body.

23:16.186 --> 23:17.313
What's his name?

23:17.396 --> 23:19.732
- His name
is Burt Berendsen.

23:19.815 --> 23:20.816
Oh, boy.

23:20.899 --> 23:23.819
- And he is hobbling
along here,

23:24.445 --> 23:27.031
remembering something
about a friendship pact.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.450
Do you remember that?
Remember me? Here I am.

23:29.533 --> 23:30.576
-Good to see you, Burt.
-Hello.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.077
My apologies, Burt Berendsen.

23:32.161 --> 23:35.664
Never again shall I pour two
without a third.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.874
Hey, Burt,
you gotta help me...

23:36.957 --> 23:38.375
-Very good.
-...trade something beautiful,

23:38.459 --> 23:39.793
and in return,
she's gonna show us

23:39.877 --> 23:41.170
what she does
with all the metal

23:41.253 --> 23:42.463
she took from our bodies.

23:43.589 --> 23:44.673
Her name is Valerie.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.800
What do you do with
all that shrapnel, Valerie?

23:47.509 --> 23:48.510
If you want to know,

23:48.594 --> 23:49.845
you have to trade me
something.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.555
-She told me the same thing.
-I got nothing.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.057
Nonsense song.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.768
That's a good idea.
How about that?

23:56.935 --> 23:58.228
What's a nonsense song?

24:00.105 --> 24:01.106
All right.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.444
The red sun.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.570
- Um...

24:07.738 --> 24:09.031
Some grapefruit.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.824
The handkerchief.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.619
- The red sun...

24:14.286 --> 24:17.247
...some grapefruit...

24:17.915 --> 24:20.918
...the handkerchief...

24:21.502 --> 24:24.088
...when you call.

24:24.838 --> 24:29.927
To see a face...

24:30.094 --> 24:31.470
...whose?

24:32.054 --> 24:34.306
My name...

24:34.473 --> 24:36.975
...my own name.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.896
It's vivid, the moment...

24:41.063 --> 24:42.815
...to love, to be.

24:42.898 --> 24:43.899
You got it.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.693
The beach is warm...

24:45.859 --> 24:47.152
The sky is cold...

24:47.319 --> 24:48.862
Death is real...

24:49.029 --> 24:50.447
...when we're dying.

24:50.864 --> 24:53.200
But the sky...

24:53.701 --> 24:58.455
...is warm with friends.

25:06.088 --> 25:07.464
I've taken all these pieces

25:07.548 --> 25:08.966
out of people's bodies.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.635
Look. This is more primitive,
this stuff.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.595
Look, I'm having a tea party.

25:14.221 --> 25:17.391
This is made out of
gun powder. And shrapnel.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.893
The height of civilization.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.818
Welcome to my world.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.903
Oh, I'm doing my makeup.

25:29.987 --> 25:31.613
Oh, do I only have
half a face?

25:31.697 --> 25:32.865
How did that happen?

25:32.948 --> 25:34.658
As long as I have my lipstick.

25:36.410 --> 25:37.536
Pretty.

25:37.619 --> 25:40.122
You got to know what you love.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.541
And you got to get
a real kick out of it,

25:42.624 --> 25:44.251
or there's too much
damn trouble in it

25:44.334 --> 25:47.212
to spoil this affair of living
from beginning to end,

25:47.296 --> 25:48.338
if you let it.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.717
Why not live it
for the beautiful things,

25:51.800 --> 25:53.886
even if you were a bit broke?

25:56.555 --> 25:57.765
What will my Beatrice think

25:57.848 --> 25:59.391
about the missing eye
business,

25:59.475 --> 26:01.518
and the scars, and the scars
on my back and everything?

26:01.602 --> 26:03.145
Can we do anything
about that, Valerie?

26:03.228 --> 26:05.898
I know benefactors
in a hospital in Amsterdam.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.108
They'll give you a new eye.

26:08.192 --> 26:09.193
Amsterdam?

26:09.735 --> 26:12.070
When I was first going through
France a couple of years ago,

26:12.154 --> 26:13.530
okay, things were
a little more difficult.

26:13.614 --> 26:14.615
I had to stab a guy.

26:14.698 --> 26:15.991
I had to hit a lady
with a brick one time.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.075
What?

26:17.159 --> 26:18.368
-Wow.
-Yeah, it's a long story.

26:18.452 --> 26:20.662
But with you two,
it will be a cakewalk.

26:21.330 --> 26:24.291
And besides, I'm far better
at forging documents now.

26:25.459 --> 26:27.336
Come on, Burt.
Let's go to Amsterdam.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.420
Okay.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.465
- Merci mes frères.
- Courage!

26:31.548 --> 26:34.426
Nous avons l'ordre officiel
de transfert pour Amsterdam.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.637
Regarde ça. Merci.

26:36.720 --> 26:37.930
-Merci Madame.
-Mais attendez!

26:38.013 --> 26:39.056
Mais qu'est-ce
que vous faites?

26:39.139 --> 26:40.933
Mais... Mais...
Messieurs dames...

26:41.016 --> 26:42.017
Mais... vous rigolez?

26:42.100 --> 26:43.477
Oui, oui Madame.
C'est très important.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.978
Mais Madame remettez les clés.

26:45.062 --> 26:46.063
Merci.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.155
-Bonjour mes amis.
-Ah!

26:55.239 --> 26:57.366
-Bonjour.
-- Bonjour. Ça va?

26:57.449 --> 26:58.617
-Mwah. Ça va.
-There you are.

27:01.203 --> 27:02.746
Paul Canterbury.
Canterbury Glass.

27:02.830 --> 27:03.831
London, England.

27:03.914 --> 27:05.332
We make the finest
prosthetic glass,

27:05.415 --> 27:07.501
industrial glass,
top-secret glass,

27:07.584 --> 27:08.585
military glass,

27:08.669 --> 27:11.088
every kind of glass
except window glass...

27:11.797 --> 27:13.507
Unless, of course,
it's bulletproof.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.093
Have no fear.
A friend of Miss Valerie

27:16.176 --> 27:18.053
is a friend
of Paul Canterbury,

27:18.136 --> 27:19.888
who offers you
a lifetime supply

27:19.972 --> 27:21.557
of Canterbury glass eyes.

27:22.015 --> 27:23.058
Not too bad.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.768
As you can see, I've got
the same injury as you.

27:24.852 --> 27:25.978
Or perhaps you can't see

27:26.061 --> 27:29.189
due to the fine craftsmanship
of Canterbury Glass.

27:30.023 --> 27:32.484
Let me see.
I believe you are a...

27:32.568 --> 27:36.154
Yes, a dark hazel-green.
Am I correct, sir?

27:36.238 --> 27:37.364
You're correct.

27:37.447 --> 27:39.992
Huzzah. This is my American
colleague, Henry Norcross.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.452
How do you do? We've been
friends of Valerie's family

27:42.536 --> 27:44.788
through international business
for many years.

27:44.872 --> 27:46.832
We've kept her safe
on her adventure,

27:46.915 --> 27:49.751
and in return, she's helped
serve the good of the world.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.546
How did she do that exactly?

27:53.046 --> 27:55.090
By attending various dinners
and functions,

27:55.173 --> 27:57.384
and telling us what
she's learned about banks

27:57.467 --> 27:58.719
and troop movement,
so on and so forth.

27:58.802 --> 28:00.721
-- Uh-huh.
-You're spies.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.764
-No. No, sir.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.850
He, uh, works
for a glass company,

28:04.933 --> 28:07.060
and I work for the Department
of the Treasury.

28:10.522 --> 28:11.732
- They're old friends.

28:11.815 --> 28:13.859
They've helped me out,
and I've helped them out.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.193
Now I think
they'll help you out.

28:15.903 --> 28:17.613
- Even Paul and I
have found

28:17.696 --> 28:18.822
some time to do
a little birding here.

28:18.906 --> 28:19.907
We're avid birders.

28:19.990 --> 28:20.991
Yes. It's an exquisite hobby,
really.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.075
- Yes.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.953
This is, uh, the African
gray crowned crane.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.038
- Yep.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.707
These are extinct.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.375
Yes, we have the last two.

28:31.084 --> 28:32.628
- The Nicobar,
uh, pigeon.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.712
- Yes.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.505
They were alive at one point.

28:35.589 --> 28:37.466
And this is
the North American pheasant.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.926
It's a North American
pheasant,

28:39.009 --> 28:41.386
which I like to call
the peasant of pheasants.

28:41.470 --> 28:42.930
They're so common, you see.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.848
-But they are beautiful.
-- Yes.

28:44.932 --> 28:46.642
The plumage
is really outstanding.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.269
So, you know, we're happy
to pay for the faces,

28:49.353 --> 28:52.147
whatever cosmetic healing
you might need, uh...

28:52.773 --> 28:54.066
Top-shelf,
nothing but the best.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.360
Yes, yes. As well as
a good life here in Amsterdam,

28:56.443 --> 28:57.653
where you deserve a rest

28:57.736 --> 29:00.113
and some freedom after
what you've been through.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.784
We'll come a-calling
sometime in the future

29:03.867 --> 29:05.619
when we need you good people
to help us out.

29:05.702 --> 29:06.703
Yes.

29:06.787 --> 29:08.455
Because there will come a time

29:08.997 --> 29:10.999
to say "enough"
to these madmen

29:11.083 --> 29:14.670
who create this war
we cannot make any sense of.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.172
Well, how could this
monstrosity repeat itself?

29:17.255 --> 29:19.424
It's supposed to be the war
to end all wars.

29:19.508 --> 29:20.509
Right.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.427
Because the dream
repeats itself

29:22.511 --> 29:23.762
since it forgets itself.

29:23.845 --> 29:26.014
That's why it repeats itself.

29:26.765 --> 29:27.766
This is the good part.

29:27.849 --> 29:29.935
But the bad part
will come again one day.

29:30.018 --> 29:32.521
But for now,
this is the good part,

29:32.604 --> 29:33.981
in Amsterdam.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.069
These are the lights
right here.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.153
They can be a little tricky.

29:40.237 --> 29:42.739
You gotta go up, down,
up, down, up.

29:42.823 --> 29:44.700
They'll flicker
for a little bit. See?

29:45.200 --> 29:46.368
Lumière.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.703
I mean, it's a big place.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.746
Paul and Henry organized it
for me, but it's a wreck.

29:49.830 --> 29:50.831
- She was right.

29:50.914 --> 29:51.915
-This was the good part.
-And this tap...

29:51.999 --> 29:52.999
-- It was fantastic.
-I mean,

29:53.083 --> 29:54.751
don't let it scare you.
When you use the water...

29:56.128 --> 29:57.129
...it will do that.

29:57.212 --> 29:58.213
- The world
was suddenly our oyster

29:58.296 --> 29:59.339
and it was glorious.

30:00.007 --> 30:01.008
That's normal.

30:09.933 --> 30:12.769
- Yeah.
Amsterdam is in the heart,

30:12.853 --> 30:14.354
and was there all along.

30:14.438 --> 30:16.440
-Go on!

30:16.523 --> 30:18.734
- Paul, show them
the sand dance!

30:20.527 --> 30:21.611
- The sand dance.

30:21.695 --> 30:24.531
The crazy British Empire
sand dance.

30:40.047 --> 30:42.883
- She was brilliant
and nuts.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.843
But she was our kind of nuts.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.930
And so the pact now had three.

30:51.349 --> 30:53.977
I stayed in Amsterdam
for a while

30:54.061 --> 30:56.021
because it was glorious there.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.815
He was steady and strong.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.734
She was bold and luminous.

31:01.485 --> 31:03.820
It was what the French call
a coup de foudre.

31:03.904 --> 31:05.238
Love at first sight.

31:06.073 --> 31:07.157
She made her art.

31:08.992 --> 31:11.161
I was their best friend,

31:11.244 --> 31:12.245
with my new eye.

31:13.914 --> 31:14.998
We helped vets

31:15.082 --> 31:16.625
-passing through town.
-Okay. That works.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.255
- We went dancing
all the time.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.008
It was magnificent.

31:26.176 --> 31:27.594
These tango parlors,

31:29.137 --> 31:31.556
you really feel like
you're flying.

31:42.192 --> 31:43.193
You can't go. I...

31:43.276 --> 31:44.486
It's terrible over there
right now.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.863
-What are you talking about?
-I have to see my wife.

31:48.198 --> 31:50.492
Burt, I have a very
bad feeling about this.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.744
I... I think it's a bad omen
if you leave.

31:53.870 --> 31:54.871
Please don't go.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.625
I became a doctor
on Park Avenue.

31:58.708 --> 31:59.876
-- Park Avenue.
-I'm married.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.462
We can... We can figure
it out, right? We can...

32:03.296 --> 32:05.632
- I know a thing or two
about Park Avenue.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.218
Please don't go.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.012
Valerie.

32:13.181 --> 32:16.685
Let's be realistic.
This can't last forever.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.728
How are we supposed to live?

32:19.271 --> 32:20.522
I missed Beatrice,

32:21.022 --> 32:23.650
even though she and her family
sent me off to war.

32:23.733 --> 32:25.026
BEATRICE'-
Serve your country.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.153
- When I first met her,

32:26.236 --> 32:28.822
I was at a charity event
at medical school.

32:28.905 --> 32:29.990
And I see this woman,

32:30.073 --> 32:31.491
the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

32:31.575 --> 32:32.742
Oh, my God.
You should've seen her.

32:32.826 --> 32:33.910
And we danced all night.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.370
We were giddy.
We were laughing.

32:35.453 --> 32:36.454
We were in love.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.373
I had no idea
that she was the daughter

32:38.456 --> 32:40.292
of the guy
who gave me the scholarship.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.879
In his eyes, this half Jew,
he was like,

32:43.962 --> 32:47.007
"You can have the scholarship,
but my daughter,

32:47.090 --> 32:50.177
-"uh-uh, off-limits."
-- Sounds bad.

32:51.052 --> 32:52.304
- You can choose
your friends.

32:52.387 --> 32:53.972
You can't choose your family.

32:54.848 --> 32:57.475
And I choose you. And this...

32:58.310 --> 32:59.311
I'm getting embarrassed,

32:59.394 --> 33:01.229
because you might not
feel the same way.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.731
But this relationship,

33:04.191 --> 33:06.860
probably the most
important thing in my life.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.030
Yeah.

33:10.113 --> 33:11.615
- We do agree. So stay.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.658
But I can't quit Beatrice.

33:15.327 --> 33:16.328
I love her.

33:17.412 --> 33:19.664
Sure, they say
you'll have medals.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.209
You'll fit in on Park Avenue.

33:23.126 --> 33:26.296
Well, this was
the hero's welcome I received.

33:26.379 --> 33:27.547
No, I've told you before,

33:27.631 --> 33:29.299
you cannot treat
these patients here.

33:29.382 --> 33:30.759
It's just completely
inappropriate.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.802
The only reason
I know these patients

33:32.886 --> 33:34.930
is because you made me
go to war.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.014
BEATRICE'-
You understand,

33:36.097 --> 33:37.349
this does not happen
on Park Avenue.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.184
And you've been taking
too much morphine.

33:39.267 --> 33:40.560
You stay away
from my daughter.

33:40.644 --> 33:41.645
You are blacklisted.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.981
Go. Leave. You must leave.
You must leave here.

33:45.774 --> 33:48.068
Don't go to the apartment.
I'll... I'll send you clothes.

33:48.151 --> 33:51.196
Bertram, stay! I'm sorry.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.328
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.372
How can I not help
the veterans?

34:01.164 --> 34:02.207
Hey.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.585
I had relocated my practice

34:05.669 --> 34:07.629
to an alley
off Great Jones Street.

34:09.631 --> 34:12.259
It got a little out of control
with the pain medicine.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.512
And I was given
an enforced rest,

34:15.595 --> 34:17.430
courtesy of the State
of New York.

34:17.514 --> 34:18.723
- Come on, buddy.

34:18.807 --> 34:21.226
- Wrote my friends
to help get me out.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.895
Had no idea
what it would do to them.

34:23.979 --> 34:25.772
If your family
has the kind of influence

34:25.855 --> 34:27.232
that can help Burt
get out of jail,

34:27.315 --> 34:28.608
I think you should do it.

34:29.276 --> 34:31.444
I mean,
the pact is the pact, Valerie.

34:31.820 --> 34:35.031
I told you I ran away
from something, didn't I?

34:35.115 --> 34:36.449
That's all you need to know.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.953
But, yes, my family
could possibly help him.

34:40.036 --> 34:42.789
But if I contact them,
they'll know where I am.

34:42.872 --> 34:44.457
And if they know where I am,

34:44.541 --> 34:47.752
they will find a way
to possibly drag me back.

34:48.878 --> 34:50.297
And they're very persuasive.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.507
All he was doing was
trying to help the regiment.

34:53.508 --> 34:55.635
I hear those guys
have it rough back at home.

34:57.679 --> 35:00.473
I think we both knew
where this was headed anyway.

35:00.557 --> 35:02.475
-Yeah.
-What do you mean by that?

35:02.559 --> 35:04.978
Well, I mean, we...
we only exist in Amsterdam.

35:06.146 --> 35:08.231
You know,
and you've spoken a lot about

35:08.315 --> 35:11.067
the things that you plan
on doing back in America.

35:11.151 --> 35:12.360
Maybe it's time.

35:13.903 --> 35:15.780
I said I wanted
to become a lawyer.

35:16.614 --> 35:17.907
To fight for people.

35:17.991 --> 35:19.576
People like those soldiers
back at home.

35:19.659 --> 35:20.994
I wanted to fight
for people like that

35:21.077 --> 35:22.078
who couldn't fight back,

35:22.162 --> 35:24.414
who couldn't fight for
themselves, to use the law.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.209
You also said that you wanna
live in Amsterdam with me.

35:29.669 --> 35:30.670
Yes.

35:31.212 --> 35:33.798
I wanna do both. I wanna
go back home and fight.

35:35.216 --> 35:36.551
And I wanna
stay here with you.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.845
And I wanna live.
I wanna truly live.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.514
How do you have
both those things?

35:44.976 --> 35:45.977
There's a way.

35:47.103 --> 35:48.730
But right now
we have to help Burt.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.823
What will happen to us?
I love you.

36:05.747 --> 36:06.956
We gotta help Burt.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.001
Okay.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.172
Get dressed.

36:27.477 --> 36:30.230
- She vanished,
one day soon after,

36:30.855 --> 36:33.858
without a word to Harold,
except a note.

36:36.277 --> 36:38.154
I was suddenly released
from jail.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.323
Never heard from her.

36:41.074 --> 36:43.785
Harold came back to New York.
Got his law degree.

36:43.868 --> 36:44.869
You have a claim.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.955
- We worked together
over 10 years.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.833
The good doctor and I
will take good care of you.

36:49.916 --> 36:52.961
- All kinds of trouble
we got people out of,

36:53.044 --> 36:55.004
until the Meekins case.

36:58.174 --> 37:01.094
This was trouble that
now we were in, ourselves.

37:02.095 --> 37:04.431
And we may
very well not survive.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.642
Oh, my God. That poor girl.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.018
I can't bear this.

37:09.102 --> 37:12.021
Something... Something
is very wrong, Harold.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.901
What's that thing
that you always say to me?

37:18.611 --> 37:19.654
We'll fight through it.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.699
We'll find a way,
no matter what.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.537
Thank you. I need that.

37:30.373 --> 37:31.583
Where... Where you going?

37:32.750 --> 37:34.544
- It's safer
if we can get off the street.

37:34.627 --> 37:36.880
Oh... I know where we are.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.841
I know where we are.
Not that woman, Burt.

37:41.718 --> 37:44.929
The lights are off.
Is it a surprise dinner?

37:45.013 --> 37:48.516
She knows people
from Liz Meekins's world.

37:49.142 --> 37:50.351
- The place
looks the same.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.187
Smells of mothballs,
like your marriage.

37:52.854 --> 37:53.855
Thanks, pal.

37:54.355 --> 37:56.149
What are friends for
if not honesty?

37:56.232 --> 37:58.109
That burns. How we looking?

38:00.820 --> 38:01.821
Good?

38:03.698 --> 38:04.699
Help me.

38:06.534 --> 38:07.702
-Is that straight?
-- Yeah.

38:08.661 --> 38:09.829
Oh, I see.

38:09.913 --> 38:11.748
You're really putting it on
nice for her, huh?

38:11.831 --> 38:13.458
-- Bertram?

38:13.541 --> 38:14.542
- Sit down. Relax.

38:14.626 --> 38:15.835
Hey, Burt,
don't be too long.

38:15.919 --> 38:16.920
- Do me a favor.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.088
-Try to be optimistic.
-- Bertram? Bertram?

38:21.966 --> 38:23.426
Oh, look at you.

38:26.221 --> 38:29.724
There is no dinner. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. It was a mistake.

38:31.017 --> 38:32.185
Why did you invite me?

38:32.685 --> 38:34.729
Because it was...
I had a moment of weakness.

38:35.396 --> 38:39.359
That's what we've become?
A moment of weakness?

38:39.442 --> 38:41.402
And my father can't even know
that I'm doing this

38:41.486 --> 38:43.905
because he'll take away
all kinds of privileges.

38:46.908 --> 38:48.493
What's wrong here?

38:49.661 --> 38:51.871
Do you remember
when we would have nights,

38:52.956 --> 38:55.959
just Emily Dickinson poetry,
and singing together

38:56.042 --> 38:58.169
and just staring
at each other?

38:58.253 --> 39:00.505
-What happened?
-I remember, yeah.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.173
That's why I love you.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.052
Did you fall?

39:06.135 --> 39:08.805
Did you hurt your back?
Let me take a look at it.

39:09.639 --> 39:12.475
- My back has been
killing me all day.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.018
This is not the right time.

39:14.102 --> 39:15.395
- Just a glimpse.
Come on.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.408
You were once so beautiful.

39:28.992 --> 39:30.660
- Oh, for God's sakes.

39:31.411 --> 39:35.039
And now you're just hideous
and grotesque.

39:35.999 --> 39:38.251
You're so ugly and deformed.

39:38.334 --> 39:40.128
-It's so hard to look at you.

39:40.837 --> 39:43.047
And you wear a corset
like a woman.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.592
-You're helpless.
-- Beatrice,

39:45.675 --> 39:48.386
I can't do this anymore.

39:48.469 --> 39:52.557
This deviance that you've come
to have about my scars.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.310
Do you choose me

39:55.393 --> 39:56.978
or do you need me?

39:58.313 --> 40:00.023
What kind of a question
is that?

40:01.316 --> 40:03.151
I was talking to someone today

40:04.193 --> 40:08.823
and they said that
love is choosing someone,

40:09.616 --> 40:13.119
not needing them
for some other reason.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.663
Did you need me when we met,

40:15.747 --> 40:17.665
or did you choose me
as a person?

40:17.749 --> 40:19.626
Was it the people around me?

40:19.709 --> 40:21.628
The prestige of my family
in medicine

40:21.711 --> 40:22.920
when you were
a scholarship student

40:23.004 --> 40:24.297
from Upstate New York?

40:25.256 --> 40:26.758
Or did you choose me?

40:28.593 --> 40:29.719
Just me?

40:32.347 --> 40:34.474
I asked Burt
the exact same question

40:34.557 --> 40:35.558
just a little while ago.

40:35.642 --> 40:37.060
- Harold Woodman.

40:37.143 --> 40:38.561
Why do you have
a woman's purse?

40:40.355 --> 40:41.981
Bill Meekins's daughter, Liz,

40:43.399 --> 40:45.068
was pushed under
a truck tonight.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.487
What, are you serious?

40:47.570 --> 40:49.614
- She hired me because
we were close to her father.

40:49.697 --> 40:50.948
That's why she trusted us.

40:51.449 --> 40:54.202
Somehow,
they think that we did it.

40:54.285 --> 40:56.871
And we need somebody.
We need something.

40:56.954 --> 40:59.290
We need someone to help us.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.376
What about the name "Rose"?

41:01.459 --> 41:03.252
That's the last thing
Liz Meekins said

41:03.336 --> 41:04.337
before she died,

41:04.420 --> 41:06.089
that a Mr. Rose
could help her.

41:07.215 --> 41:09.342
Liz would never have known
a Rose. That's a Jewish name.

41:09.425 --> 41:11.678
Oh. Thank you, Beatrice.

41:11.761 --> 41:13.971
You're only half.
Harold, you misheard.

41:14.055 --> 41:15.139
Why?

41:15.223 --> 41:17.350
Because it has to be "Voze"
with a "V."

41:17.433 --> 41:19.435
That's a prominent family
in the Social Register.

41:21.104 --> 41:23.272
The Vozes
are at the top of it.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.942
Burt, this is what
I'm talking about.

41:26.025 --> 41:28.611
This is your world that
we're in trouble in, not mine.

41:33.991 --> 41:35.785
-What's that?

41:36.828 --> 41:38.663
How dare you come in here?

41:38.746 --> 41:39.831
-- The door was unlocked.

41:39.914 --> 41:41.457
This is still
your listed address, right?

41:41.541 --> 41:42.667
- Apparently so.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.127
Detective Getweiler,
what brings you here

41:44.210 --> 41:45.795
at this hour?
You need more pills, Lem?

41:45.878 --> 41:48.548
I know you have
the same brace as I do,

41:48.631 --> 41:50.299
not like Mr. Hiltz.

41:50.383 --> 41:51.843
Your flat arches
stopped the Germans

41:51.926 --> 41:53.386
from seeing you
in the Rhineland.

41:54.178 --> 41:55.680
You know why I'm here, Burt.

41:55.763 --> 41:57.140
You and Woodman fled the scene

41:57.223 --> 41:58.975
after you pushed the
Meekins woman under a truck.

41:59.684 --> 42:02.145
Why would you possibly think
that was us?

42:02.228 --> 42:03.229
Well, there's not
too many people

42:03.312 --> 42:05.565
that fit the description of
a doctor looking for his eye

42:05.648 --> 42:07.608
on the ground
with his Black attorney.

42:08.109 --> 42:10.820
The woman who died
hired Harold

42:10.903 --> 42:12.822
to look into
her father's death.

42:12.905 --> 42:15.616
I did an autopsy on him
this afternoon.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.661
He was the general of the
regiment we served in, Lem.

42:19.996 --> 42:21.622
Witnesses say you pushed her.

42:22.123 --> 42:24.041
No, we had to get out
of there. It was chaos.

42:24.125 --> 42:26.085
A fight broke out.
The killer pointed at us.

42:26.169 --> 42:27.754
He's very good
at being a criminal.

42:27.837 --> 42:28.963
Well, I know one thing.

42:29.046 --> 42:30.715
I need to give
my captain answers.

42:30.798 --> 42:33.176
And at the moment,
you two are the suspects.

42:34.969 --> 42:36.095
Can you prove you have

42:36.179 --> 42:38.014
an employment contract
with Liz Meekins?

42:38.097 --> 42:40.016
That she hired you
to be her attorney?

42:40.099 --> 42:41.350
Absolutely.
I can get that to you.

42:41.434 --> 42:43.770
Plus, I can get you
the preliminary autopsy report

42:43.853 --> 42:45.938
and the Bill Meekins
estate papers.

42:46.022 --> 42:47.106
Good.

42:47.190 --> 42:48.566
- No, we gotta...
we gotta take you in...

42:48.649 --> 42:50.902
-Get your hands off of me.
-Hiltz. Hiltz, Hiltz.

42:50.985 --> 42:52.278
I'm a part
of the Bar Association.

42:52.361 --> 42:53.362
Don't touch me.

42:53.446 --> 42:57.200
I don't even like that
this man is a lawyer.

42:58.743 --> 42:59.994
Columbia Law School.

43:01.370 --> 43:02.747
Maybe those flat-ass
arches of yours

43:02.830 --> 43:04.081
make that hard for you
to comprehend.

43:04.165 --> 43:05.750
Don't talk to me
about my flat arches.

43:05.833 --> 43:06.834
I'll crack your head right...

43:06.918 --> 43:08.836
Hiltz, no, you won't.
Knock it off!

43:09.837 --> 43:11.380
What if we got someone
to vouch for us?

43:11.464 --> 43:13.049
Someone from
the Social Register?

43:14.383 --> 43:16.135
Would that get
your captain's attention?

43:16.761 --> 43:18.012
Someone like

43:18.596 --> 43:21.307
Mr. Voze,
who knew Bill Meekins.

43:21.849 --> 43:22.850
Bertram...

43:23.768 --> 43:24.852
Beatrice.

43:25.686 --> 43:27.188
- My family
are long-standing members

43:27.271 --> 43:28.481
of the state medical board.

43:28.564 --> 43:31.108
And I can attest to the fact
that both of these men

43:31.192 --> 43:32.985
are horrible liars,

43:33.069 --> 43:34.445
to each other,
let alone to the police.

43:35.154 --> 43:38.282
If you take them in
before giving them the chance

43:38.366 --> 43:40.076
to give you everything
that they've offered,

43:40.159 --> 43:41.744
I'm afraid it might
cost you your job.

43:42.245 --> 43:44.080
My father has a lot of friends
at City Hall.

43:51.420 --> 43:53.172
Get us everything
you promised.

43:53.673 --> 43:56.175
Understand, you and me,

43:56.801 --> 43:58.302
we got something in common.

43:58.719 --> 44:00.972
We served, not like this guy.

44:01.055 --> 44:03.933
What about the missing purse?
Where did that go?

44:04.433 --> 44:06.936
This could...
This could be evidence.

44:07.019 --> 44:08.020
What are you doing with that?
Put that down.

44:08.104 --> 44:09.230
- Put that back.
- What's in here?

44:09.313 --> 44:10.314
-What's this?
-Put it down.

44:10.398 --> 44:11.399
-I'm just saying...
-Put that back.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.692
-Oh-oh.

44:14.318 --> 44:16.070
- I'm sorry.
I was being careful.

44:16.153 --> 44:17.822
What is the matter with you?

44:18.239 --> 44:19.574
He's learning, Burt.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.534
He, uh...
He can be a good detective.

44:22.702 --> 44:25.204
And when you spoke to Voze,
you let me know right away.

44:25.288 --> 44:27.206
I'm not gonna wait that long.
You hear me, Burt?

44:27.290 --> 44:28.749
-Yes.
-I'll give you a few days.

44:28.833 --> 44:29.834
But if I have to,

44:29.917 --> 44:31.252
-I'll bring you in myself.
-I understand.

44:31.335 --> 44:33.212
-And I need some pills too.
-I got it.

44:33.296 --> 44:35.172
I'll be seeing you
in your office pretty soon.

44:35.256 --> 44:37.216
-- Yes.
-But it's a bad situation.

44:38.009 --> 44:39.135
It's very bad.

44:43.639 --> 44:45.349
-Well, that was exciting.

44:45.933 --> 44:46.934
Go and get your things,

44:47.018 --> 44:48.269
but don't get killed
on the way home.

45:00.907 --> 45:02.909
Committee of the Five,
stay alive.

45:03.326 --> 45:04.869
Keep your mouth shut.

45:04.952 --> 45:07.288
- Why not just drive up
and shoot us?

45:08.748 --> 45:10.458
Committee of the Five,
always alive!

45:11.125 --> 45:13.461
- What else did this guy
have in mind for us?

45:13.544 --> 45:14.670
- We're everywhere.

45:22.929 --> 45:26.307
So now we have to lie
to get into this guy's house.

45:27.975 --> 45:30.811
Doesn't matter how.
We are gonna see Mr. Voze.

45:33.230 --> 45:34.398
What is this charity?

45:34.482 --> 45:35.900
Okay, that's the Episcopal one.

45:35.983 --> 45:37.109
The door opens and you say?

45:37.193 --> 45:38.194
I say, "Hello..."

45:38.986 --> 45:40.696
My name is Dr. Burt Berendsen.

45:40.780 --> 45:42.615
This is Harold Woodman, Esquire,

45:42.698 --> 45:43.950
Medal of Honor recipient.

45:44.700 --> 45:45.826
It's the Croix de Guerre,

45:45.910 --> 45:47.536
not the Medal of Honor,
and you know that.

45:47.620 --> 45:49.997
- Croix de Guerre, yes.
Sorry.

45:58.381 --> 46:01.258
We know how the Episcopalians
love Mr. Voze.

46:01.342 --> 46:03.219
He'll be sorry to have
missed you. He's not in.

46:03.302 --> 46:05.054
- Well, when do you think
he'll be back?

46:05.137 --> 46:06.514
I don't know.

46:06.597 --> 46:08.391
But perhaps you could
leave that letter with me?

46:08.474 --> 46:11.060
- We need to hand this
directly to Mr. Voze.

46:11.852 --> 46:13.646
On orders from the Bishop.

46:13.729 --> 46:15.940
Right. Well, then,
you can leave a card.

46:16.023 --> 46:17.733
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
gentlemen.

46:19.151 --> 46:20.403
However, do you mind?

46:21.487 --> 46:22.905
I'm looking at this cabinet,

46:22.989 --> 46:26.367
and I... I couldn't help
but recognize

46:27.201 --> 46:28.703
these crafts.

46:28.786 --> 46:30.746
Are these made in a hospital,
over here?

46:30.830 --> 46:31.956
See? Yes.

46:32.039 --> 46:33.624
- Looks like the works
of veterans. Yes.

46:34.083 --> 46:35.543
-- All by veterans.
-Right.

46:35.626 --> 46:37.211
Mr. Voze's primary charity.

46:37.294 --> 46:39.046
They send them
all the time as thanks.

46:39.130 --> 46:41.048
That, uh, is very kind.

46:41.132 --> 46:42.466
-And we, in fact...

46:42.550 --> 46:43.676
...uh, are veterans...

46:43.759 --> 46:45.177
Libby, can I have the remedy,
please?

46:45.261 --> 46:46.679
I've got that numbness
in my hands,

46:46.762 --> 46:47.847
and the chills in the nerves

46:47.930 --> 46:49.306
and shooting pains.

46:49.390 --> 46:50.391
Please?

46:50.474 --> 46:51.600
- Valerie,
please go into your room

46:51.684 --> 46:53.185
or go back upstairs.

46:53.269 --> 46:55.271
Can't you see
we have company present?

46:59.650 --> 47:00.901
What are you doing here?

47:03.904 --> 47:05.156
What are you doing here?

47:05.656 --> 47:08.242
No. Don't talk to her.
She's not well.

47:08.325 --> 47:10.202
Valerie,
don't talk to these men.

47:10.286 --> 47:13.539
I'm not a hemophiliac, Libby.
I can talk to people.

47:13.622 --> 47:14.749
- Yes,
you're not a hemophiliac,

47:14.832 --> 47:16.083
but you are epileptic,

47:16.167 --> 47:18.127
and you have
a nervous disorder. No!

47:18.210 --> 47:20.963
-We talked about the doll.
-I'll bite your ears off.

47:21.047 --> 47:23.841
No! I told you not to do that
with the doll.

47:23.924 --> 47:26.093
-Mrs. Moran! Carlton...
-Carlton!

47:26.177 --> 47:28.012
You know that disturbs me,
Valerie.

47:28.095 --> 47:29.764
How dare you! Carlton!

47:29.847 --> 47:31.015
Carlton.

47:31.098 --> 47:32.224
- Valerie, honestly.

47:32.308 --> 47:35.061
We spoke about
leaving me alone with her.

47:35.478 --> 47:37.271
Come in here.
We can talk in here.

48:11.055 --> 48:13.015
How is this coincidence
even possible?

48:13.099 --> 48:14.892
Because it's not
a coincidence.

48:16.519 --> 48:18.854
I told Liz Meekins
to hire you two.

48:18.938 --> 48:21.440
What do you mean, you told
Liz Meekins to hire us?

48:21.524 --> 48:22.525
She's a friend of mine.

48:22.608 --> 48:23.734
She needed someone
she could trust.

48:23.818 --> 48:25.486
Someone outside
our social circle.

48:26.195 --> 48:27.655
This is so strange.

48:28.114 --> 48:29.698
I never really told you
my real last name.

48:29.782 --> 48:31.450
Bandenberg
was a traveling name.

48:32.034 --> 48:33.702
But that was our deal
in Amsterdam.

48:33.786 --> 48:35.162
Nothing about the past.

48:37.623 --> 48:38.624
Right?

48:39.208 --> 48:41.127
You live in New Jersey?
This whole time?

48:43.170 --> 48:44.797
-Yeah.
-- This is a big house.

48:44.880 --> 48:46.799
-This is how you live?
-Yeah.

48:51.137 --> 48:52.596
No letter.

48:54.056 --> 48:56.892
-Not a phone call.
-- I was embarrassed.

48:57.393 --> 48:58.602
This is not who I once was.

48:58.686 --> 49:00.479
It's not who you met
in Amsterdam.

49:05.359 --> 49:06.610
- What's wrong
with your balance?

49:06.694 --> 49:09.238
I have a nerve disorder.

49:10.239 --> 49:11.407
You never had that before.

49:11.490 --> 49:13.325
No, she never had that before.

49:16.287 --> 49:18.539
We are here for a reason.

49:18.622 --> 49:20.749
Harold, let's not forget,
it's pretty urgent.

49:21.250 --> 49:22.418
Valerie,

49:23.043 --> 49:24.211
do you know Tom Voze?

49:24.628 --> 49:26.046
Of course I know Tom.

49:26.130 --> 49:27.756
- We're in a lot
of trouble, Valerie.

49:27.840 --> 49:29.300
We need him to vouch for us.

49:29.383 --> 49:30.384
- He's a good guy,

49:30.467 --> 49:32.052
but I don't know
if he's gonna vouch for you.

49:32.136 --> 49:34.138
He avoids controversy.
He doesn't like that.

49:34.221 --> 49:35.848
He's easily intimidated.

49:35.931 --> 49:38.184
-Is he your husband?
-- Carlton's on his way!

49:38.267 --> 49:39.310
No, he's not my husband.

49:39.393 --> 49:40.561
He's married
to the woman out there

49:40.644 --> 49:41.812
screaming to have you
kicked out right now.

49:41.896 --> 49:42.897
He's my brother.

49:43.564 --> 49:45.316
After everything we had
in Amsterdam,

49:45.399 --> 49:47.443
turns out Burt and I
have no idea who you are.

49:48.527 --> 49:52.031
You know exactly who I am.
I know exactly who you are.

49:52.865 --> 49:55.451
All three of us. Burt too.

49:55.993 --> 49:57.703
We know each other
the way it counts.

49:58.329 --> 50:00.039
And if you two
still have an arrangement,

50:00.122 --> 50:01.624
then I'm still part of it.

50:01.707 --> 50:03.042
Maybe not after 12 years.

50:03.125 --> 50:05.127
- Yes,
after 12 years. Yes.

50:05.211 --> 50:06.587
Because I ended up here.

50:06.670 --> 50:08.964
And I came back
because of you and you.

50:13.177 --> 50:14.428
That's true.

50:17.223 --> 50:18.724
I told you
when you left Amsterdam,

50:18.807 --> 50:19.808
something bad would happen.

50:19.892 --> 50:21.518
I said it would be
the bad part of the dream.

50:21.602 --> 50:22.645
Did I not say that?

50:23.229 --> 50:24.230
-It's true.

50:24.313 --> 50:25.314
And here we are.

50:25.397 --> 50:27.399
- Valerie,
Carlton's on his way.

50:27.483 --> 50:29.026
-Open the door.

50:29.109 --> 50:30.361
We can get out of it.

50:33.656 --> 50:34.657
Well, it's different here,

50:34.740 --> 50:36.367
-so I don't know about that.

50:36.450 --> 50:37.952
- Carlton is coming,
Valerie.

50:38.035 --> 50:39.578
I have a feeling
this is Carlton.

50:39.662 --> 50:41.205
-- Oh, no.

50:41.580 --> 50:43.040
-No. Oh, no, no, no.

50:43.666 --> 50:45.417
-Ah...

50:45.501 --> 50:47.253
-Carlton. Carlton. Please.
-Wait. Wait...

50:47.711 --> 50:48.837
-Oh!

50:52.383 --> 50:54.009
Valerie, do you see
what happens?

50:54.093 --> 50:56.053
How do you possibly know
any of these men?

51:01.600 --> 51:03.978
There he is.
The brandy, Mrs. Moran.

51:09.608 --> 51:11.068
- No, thank you.
I don't drink.

51:11.568 --> 51:12.861
Well, I don't think
I trust a man

51:12.945 --> 51:14.029
who doesn't like a drink,

51:14.113 --> 51:15.990
especially at a time
like this.

51:17.408 --> 51:19.201
Where is my eye, Harold?

51:20.286 --> 51:21.870
-- Right here.
-Thanks.

51:22.496 --> 51:24.832
I never expected
two decorated soldiers

51:24.915 --> 51:26.667
to get knocked out
in my own home.

51:27.543 --> 51:28.794
No, just one, sir.

51:29.712 --> 51:32.381
Oh, that's right, Mr. Woodman.
You were too fast for Carlton.

51:33.757 --> 51:34.967
- I was.

51:35.050 --> 51:37.803
They started talking to
Valerie, and she's not well.

51:37.886 --> 51:41.223
And please,
darling girl, stop crying.

51:41.974 --> 51:44.059
It's only natural
for her to cry, Libby.

51:44.143 --> 51:46.061
She just found out
her friend is dead.

51:47.146 --> 51:49.189
We couldn't keep it
from her for forever.

51:49.940 --> 51:52.526
I'm not so ill
that I can't talk to people.

51:52.609 --> 51:54.445
- You leave me here
with this invalid

51:54.528 --> 51:55.612
when you know very well
that I think

51:55.696 --> 51:56.947
-she should be hospitalized.
-- Libby.

51:57.031 --> 51:58.782
-It's for her own good.
-If you ever say that

51:58.866 --> 51:59.867
-to me again...
-I can't handle...

51:59.950 --> 52:00.951
It will be a better place
for you.

52:01.035 --> 52:02.036
...I'll put you in a hospital.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.120
I'll send you
to a witch trial.

52:03.203 --> 52:05.998
Ladies, please.
Ladies. Stop.

52:07.750 --> 52:11.587
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I had to raise my voice.

52:12.421 --> 52:14.131
She was talking to these men
like she knows them.

52:14.214 --> 52:15.966
-That terrified me.

52:18.969 --> 52:20.554
Do you know one another?

52:20.637 --> 52:21.680
- Yes.
- No.

52:23.057 --> 52:24.683
-Yes.
-- We do, indeed.

52:24.767 --> 52:26.101
Europe.

52:26.185 --> 52:28.187
-From Amsterdam.
-- The hospital.

52:28.270 --> 52:30.647
They said they were
from the Episcopal charities.

52:30.731 --> 52:32.816
Is there any truth
to that at all?

52:33.317 --> 52:34.526
-Uh, absolutely.
-In part.

52:34.610 --> 52:35.611
- In part?

52:36.236 --> 52:37.905
Hey, the gala is coming up.

52:37.988 --> 52:39.239
Mostly a veteran event.

52:39.323 --> 52:41.367
But there might be
Episcopalians there.

52:41.450 --> 52:44.203
And Bill Meekins
was our featured speaker.

52:44.787 --> 52:47.414
But we find ourselves
in this terrible situation

52:47.498 --> 52:48.916
where we're accused
of killing Liz Meekins,

52:48.999 --> 52:50.959
which is not true in any way.

52:51.043 --> 52:52.586
Liz mentioned the name "Voze,"

52:52.669 --> 52:54.797
and so we thought you might
know who was after her

52:54.880 --> 52:56.256
and can help clear our names.

52:56.340 --> 52:58.509
We're veterans.
We're respectable.

52:58.592 --> 53:00.636
We wouldn't be involved
in any of this,

53:02.012 --> 53:03.097
except to help.

53:04.098 --> 53:07.559
Bill Meekins was
a graham cracker of a man.

53:07.976 --> 53:10.604
Not a mean bone in his body.

53:10.687 --> 53:13.023
Then why...
Why did I have to help her?

53:13.107 --> 53:14.900
Why did I have
to encourage her to go around

53:14.983 --> 53:16.777
everyone we know
and hire these two?

53:16.860 --> 53:18.278
- I did help her, darling.

53:18.987 --> 53:21.532
I told her to come to me
before it got bad.

53:22.157 --> 53:23.367
Now look what happened.

53:24.368 --> 53:26.995
Yes. Look what you did,
Valerie.

53:27.079 --> 53:28.288
I'm sorry, it's unfortunate,

53:28.372 --> 53:29.790
but you shouldn't have
gotten involved.

53:29.873 --> 53:31.041
It's not her fault.

53:31.708 --> 53:33.585
-It's not her fault.
-Tom.

53:33.669 --> 53:35.087
-How is this not her fault?
-It's not...

53:35.170 --> 53:37.589
-Some things are her fault.
-Tom. Tom.

53:38.257 --> 53:39.383
Oh, Tom.

53:39.466 --> 53:41.009
- She's sick.

53:45.722 --> 53:47.558
We can find
who killed Bill Meekins.

53:47.641 --> 53:50.185
It's probably the same people
who killed his daughter.

53:50.727 --> 53:51.854
We're looking into it.

53:52.354 --> 53:55.941
And, uh, that information
will clear our names.

53:56.024 --> 53:57.317
Now, the autopsy indicated

53:57.401 --> 53:59.278
that he was possibly poisoned

54:00.028 --> 54:02.072
by too many medicines
while he was in Europe.

54:02.156 --> 54:05.075
Do you know who he was
traveling with, who sent him?

54:05.159 --> 54:06.368
I can help you find out,

54:06.452 --> 54:08.662
but I can't get
personally involved.

54:08.745 --> 54:09.830
You're a coward, Tom.

54:09.913 --> 54:11.707
Don't you dare
call him a coward.

54:11.790 --> 54:12.791
You know
that's what he was called

54:12.875 --> 54:14.126
by those prep-school kids.

54:14.209 --> 54:16.295
It's cruel, Valerie,
and you know that.

54:16.712 --> 54:17.796
They want me to get involved

54:17.880 --> 54:19.965
in all these committees,
clubs.

54:20.757 --> 54:22.134
Do you know what I do instead?

54:24.344 --> 54:26.013
-I'm a bird watcher.

54:26.513 --> 54:27.931
-That's what I do.

54:28.015 --> 54:29.933
Mm, it must be good,
get you outside.

54:30.017 --> 54:32.519
You're a bird watcher.
He's ridiculous.

54:32.603 --> 54:34.188
He's no more ridiculous
than you are

54:34.271 --> 54:36.440
with your movies,
razor blades, teacups,

54:36.523 --> 54:37.774
the horrid things you make.

54:37.858 --> 54:39.526
Honestly, Valerie,
they're demented.

54:39.610 --> 54:40.652
Excuse me.

54:41.236 --> 54:43.405
You said that you could
help us find

54:44.072 --> 54:46.408
who traveled with him
to Europe. Who would know?

54:49.745 --> 54:51.914
Gil Dillenbeck would know.
Do you know him?

54:53.040 --> 54:54.374
The whole country knows him.

54:54.458 --> 54:57.252
He's the most decorated
Marine in US history.

54:57.336 --> 54:58.670
-Yeah.
-Yes, he is.

54:59.296 --> 55:01.548
Dillenbeck was friends
with Meekins.

55:01.632 --> 55:02.799
They were both generals.

55:02.883 --> 55:04.551
I never got involved
in the military.

55:04.635 --> 55:06.887
I just ran
the family's textile company.

55:07.554 --> 55:10.516
Dillenbeck can tell you who
was traveling with Meekins.

55:11.183 --> 55:12.267
I wouldn't trust anyone else.

55:12.351 --> 55:13.435
And I don't have access

55:13.519 --> 55:15.145
to that kind
of information myself.

55:16.063 --> 55:18.774
-Okay, okay. We met him twice.
-Yeah.

55:18.857 --> 55:21.193
Took a picture with him once
in Belgium and another...

55:21.276 --> 55:22.611
-D.C.
-...at the Bonus Army march

55:22.694 --> 55:24.530
-in summer '32.
-Right.

55:24.613 --> 55:25.948
We still have those pictures,
Mr. Voze.

55:26.031 --> 55:27.032
Yeah. Right.

55:27.115 --> 55:29.117
He's very particular
about who he'll speak to.

55:30.410 --> 55:31.537
If you've met him,

55:31.620 --> 55:32.913
and you're soldiers
he respects,

55:32.996 --> 55:34.998
your chances
are far better than mine.

55:35.082 --> 55:37.084
Yeah, he distrusts
people of means.

55:37.918 --> 55:39.586
If you meet him,
please do let us know.

55:39.670 --> 55:41.255
I would love
to shake his hand.

55:42.422 --> 55:44.633
Libby saw Dillenbeck
in the newsreel,

55:44.716 --> 55:46.009
and she has a crush on him.

55:46.093 --> 55:47.719
Don't be ridiculous, Valerie.

55:47.803 --> 55:49.429
- You have talked
about that newsreel.

55:49.513 --> 55:50.597
He's a very impressive man.

55:50.681 --> 55:51.682
Yes, he is.

55:51.765 --> 55:53.141
And I happen to like
that newsreel.

55:53.225 --> 55:54.226
Don't play it.
Don't play it, Tom.

55:54.309 --> 55:55.602
Oh, we should play it
before they go.

55:55.686 --> 55:56.770
Valerie,

55:56.853 --> 55:59.022
Gil Dillenbeck is perhaps
the one hope your friends have

55:59.106 --> 56:00.274
of getting out
of all this trouble.

56:04.987 --> 56:07.114
Would you like
to see the newsreel?

56:09.199 --> 56:10.367
Oh, good.

56:12.828 --> 56:14.079
The veterans who marched

56:14.162 --> 56:15.372
last summer for benefits

56:15.455 --> 56:18.333
remain under the leadership
of General Gil Dillenbeck.

56:18.417 --> 56:20.627
The veterans' benefits
are still unpaid,

56:20.711 --> 56:23.589
though the brave general
remains their spokesperson.

56:24.256 --> 56:27.467
Look, look,
it makes me so damn mad.

56:27.551 --> 56:30.053
A whole lot of people
speak of you as tramps.

56:30.137 --> 56:32.598
"Tramps! You men are tramps."

56:32.681 --> 56:35.517
Who are these people
who dare call you that?

56:35.601 --> 56:36.768
You're soldiers.

56:36.852 --> 56:39.771
You sacrificed your lives,
your limbs.

56:39.855 --> 56:42.608
You've suffered that
for your country.

56:45.944 --> 56:47.070
The government burned them

56:47.154 --> 56:48.905
out of the nation's capital.

56:48.989 --> 56:51.325
Veterans never got
one benefit.

56:51.408 --> 56:52.409
Who in the hell has done

56:52.492 --> 56:53.869
all the bleeding
for this country,

56:53.952 --> 56:56.246
and for this law, and
this Constitution anyhow,

56:56.330 --> 56:57.998
but you fellows?

56:58.081 --> 56:59.750
- Tom,
it ruined the newsreel.

56:59.833 --> 57:01.918
- I'm so sorry, darling.
I will replace that.

57:02.002 --> 57:03.378
- Libby's
precious newsreel.

57:03.462 --> 57:06.089
- We were there. We took
pictures with the general.

57:06.173 --> 57:08.634
- Such a handsome man.
Such a strong man.

57:08.717 --> 57:11.178
Now that is true character
in a man.

57:11.261 --> 57:13.221
Tom is also
of excellent character.

57:13.305 --> 57:15.932
And, yes, he prefers birding
to politics.

57:16.016 --> 57:17.684
But it's meaningful.

57:17.768 --> 57:19.561
You said you'd come back.

57:20.479 --> 57:22.814
Why? So you could leave me?

57:23.815 --> 57:25.609
I didn't know if I was
a fleeting adventure

57:25.692 --> 57:28.236
or if you even thought
about me at all, Valerie.

57:28.737 --> 57:31.907
I never thought
of anyone else. Not really.

57:33.116 --> 57:34.284
What about you?

57:35.786 --> 57:37.579
No. Not really.

57:38.914 --> 57:39.915
Really?

57:41.083 --> 57:42.084
Yes.

57:43.794 --> 57:44.961
And what did you mean,
"embarrassed"?

57:45.045 --> 57:46.046
What did you mean by that?

57:46.129 --> 57:49.174
Embarrassed to contact me
all these years?

57:49.841 --> 57:51.968
Just seeing me like this. I...

57:52.052 --> 57:53.512
It's not who I was
in Amsterdam.

57:53.595 --> 57:55.180
And for what? For what?

57:55.263 --> 57:57.099
We can't be together
in this country.

58:03.939 --> 58:05.190
You see that garden?

58:06.942 --> 58:09.361
I spend at least an hour
out there every day.

58:09.444 --> 58:10.946
-Oh, that's great.
-Mm.

58:11.863 --> 58:14.741
See a rose-breasted grosbeak,

58:14.825 --> 58:16.451
a dark-eyed junco,

58:17.119 --> 58:18.870
reminds me
of God's green earth.

58:18.954 --> 58:20.038
- Hmm.

58:20.747 --> 58:22.749
Yeah, I don't know
those birds. But...

58:23.667 --> 58:25.669
There's this man from England

58:25.752 --> 58:29.339
who has violated
every sacred rule of birding

58:30.132 --> 58:31.800
by going into 24 nests

58:31.883 --> 58:34.636
of a near-extinct species
of bird

58:35.554 --> 58:37.514
to take 24 eggs.

58:38.265 --> 58:40.267
All for one man's
selfish glorification

58:40.350 --> 58:42.060
to get his name in a bird book

58:42.144 --> 58:43.979
for some
meaningless discovery.

58:46.565 --> 58:48.024
And that
is the type of person,

58:48.108 --> 58:50.318
I think, who very likely
did something awful

58:50.402 --> 58:52.237
to Bill Meekins
and his daughter.

58:52.320 --> 58:53.321
I'm trying
to follow you here, sir.

58:53.405 --> 58:55.991
You're saying that man,
the bird thing,

58:56.616 --> 58:58.869
England, the nest,
and the book,

58:58.952 --> 59:01.246
that he killed Bill Meekins?

59:02.247 --> 59:04.958
I'm trying to make a point.
Yeah?

59:05.041 --> 59:06.793
That type of man.

59:07.878 --> 59:11.089
Okay. I'm still not certain.
What do you mean?

59:12.048 --> 59:14.301
Dr. Berendsen,
you seem like a good person

59:14.384 --> 59:16.845
with your medicines
and your veterans.

59:17.721 --> 59:20.599
You shouldn't be hindered.
You should be helped.

59:21.516 --> 59:23.310
-But I'm only one person.
-Sir,

59:24.269 --> 59:25.479
we didn't do anything,

59:25.562 --> 59:27.272
and we need the police
to know that.

59:30.066 --> 59:31.151
Maybe Dillenbeck.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.324
-Tomorrow?

59:37.407 --> 59:39.367
Can you come back tomorrow?
The house will be empty.

59:39.451 --> 59:40.702
-They'll be at the other house

59:40.786 --> 59:42.412
for one of Libby's
culture talks, please.

59:43.705 --> 59:45.916
-Shush.

59:45.999 --> 59:48.210
What do you mean, "shush"?
What are you guys doing?

59:48.752 --> 59:49.961
I've been discussing crimes

59:50.045 --> 59:51.713
of the bird society
of England.

59:52.214 --> 59:53.673
Your brother's a little kooky.

59:53.757 --> 59:55.342
Burt, I don't know
what's happening,

59:55.425 --> 59:57.260
but it's far beyond
Meekins and his daughter.

59:57.344 --> 59:59.763
And I don't trust
my medications now either.

1:00:00.472 --> 1:00:03.975
We just have to
get Dillenbeck. That's it.

1:00:04.601 --> 1:00:06.061
Great, take me with you.

1:00:06.144 --> 1:00:08.563
-- Valerie.
-I can come. I can help.

1:00:09.397 --> 1:00:11.650
-She can. It's true.
-Burt.

1:00:11.733 --> 1:00:13.401
The three of us,
we were inseparable.

1:00:13.485 --> 1:00:14.903
We did things,
we got things done,

1:00:14.986 --> 1:00:16.780
and most of all, we lived.

1:00:17.364 --> 1:00:19.491
-Harold?
-I have to get out of here,

1:00:19.574 --> 1:00:21.076
-please!
-- She's right.

1:00:21.159 --> 1:00:23.703
-Burt. She could help us.
-I can help.

1:00:23.787 --> 1:00:24.788
- Valerie?

1:00:24.871 --> 1:00:25.997
What are you doing?

1:00:26.081 --> 1:00:27.582
It's time to get
your friends to the door.

1:00:27.666 --> 1:00:29.334
Dr. Malin's coming.

1:00:33.338 --> 1:00:35.382
Thank you for coming.
Sorry for the trouble.

1:00:35.841 --> 1:00:38.510
- Thank you.
This turned out very helpful.

1:00:38.593 --> 1:00:39.886
Looking forward to this.

1:00:40.554 --> 1:00:42.722
Please say goodbye
to Carlton for me.

1:00:45.475 --> 1:00:47.352
Thank you. Talk to you soon.

1:00:53.441 --> 1:00:54.442
Valerie?

1:00:55.235 --> 1:00:56.736
Dr. Malin will be here
with the remedies

1:00:56.820 --> 1:00:58.071
you asked for, remember?

1:01:02.117 --> 1:01:03.201
- Are you Dr. Malin?

1:01:03.577 --> 1:01:04.744
Yes. Yes, I am.

1:01:04.828 --> 1:01:07.956
Oh, I'm a doctor.
If you don't mind my asking,

1:01:08.039 --> 1:01:10.500
in your professional opinion,
what is her condition?

1:01:11.376 --> 1:01:13.545
Hereditary nervous disorder.

1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:15.589
Affects her blood pressure,

1:01:15.672 --> 1:01:17.674
her balance,
her nerves and movement.

1:01:18.174 --> 1:01:20.218
No, she never
had that before, Doctor.

1:01:21.052 --> 1:01:22.554
It advances with age.

1:01:23.972 --> 1:01:25.432
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Doctor.

1:01:31.730 --> 1:01:32.814
- My God.

1:01:32.898 --> 1:01:34.357
I can't believe
we saw Valerie.

1:01:34.441 --> 1:01:36.651
-- First thing tomorrow...
-She looks great.

1:01:37.277 --> 1:01:38.278
- First thing...

1:01:38.361 --> 1:01:39.529
- Such bad luck,
she got that ailment.

1:01:39.613 --> 1:01:40.697
- ...we go
to Dillenbeck's,

1:01:40.780 --> 1:01:42.532
and we hope we get in.

1:01:42.616 --> 1:01:45.118
-Dillenbeck said no, Burt.

1:01:45.201 --> 1:01:46.453
Dillenbeck said no?

1:01:46.536 --> 1:01:48.413
What do you mean, he said no?
Did you talk to him?

1:01:48.496 --> 1:01:49.789
I talked to his wife.

1:01:49.873 --> 1:01:51.833
She said no.
They get too many visitors.

1:01:51.917 --> 1:01:54.085
We... We have to keep trying.

1:01:54.169 --> 1:01:56.588
Uh, did you send,
uh, the... the...

1:01:56.671 --> 1:01:58.840
the photographs
of when we met him?

1:01:58.924 --> 1:02:02.469
No, because you have to bring
the pictures yourself.

1:02:02.552 --> 1:02:03.803
All right, where is Harold?

1:02:03.887 --> 1:02:05.472
He was supposed to take me
to Dillenbeck's.

1:02:05.555 --> 1:02:07.265
He was meant to be here
hours ago.

1:02:07.349 --> 1:02:08.350
I don't know.

1:02:08.433 --> 1:02:11.937
But the police are here,
and they wanna talk to you.

1:02:13.647 --> 1:02:17.067
Okay. All right,
everything all at once.

1:02:17.150 --> 1:02:19.319
- Irma St. Clair
is waiting, also.

1:02:19.402 --> 1:02:21.863
Oh, God! All right.

1:02:22.656 --> 1:02:23.740
Uh...

1:02:23.823 --> 1:02:25.408
- Peanuts

1:02:25.492 --> 1:02:26.493
Not now. Not now.

1:02:28.662 --> 1:02:29.663
-Oh, come on.
-Are you sure

1:02:29.746 --> 1:02:31.873
-this is safe, Valerie?
-Yes, it's safe. It's fine.

1:02:31.957 --> 1:02:34.584
They're at the other house.
They'll be there all day.

1:02:38.129 --> 1:02:39.673
Remember this?

1:02:39.756 --> 1:02:42.217
-You look perfect.

1:02:42.926 --> 1:02:43.927
That's you.

1:02:48.640 --> 1:02:49.641
That's you.

1:02:58.108 --> 1:02:59.734
-Pourquoi?

1:02:59.818 --> 1:03:02.028
-Amsterdam.
-Say, "Amsterdam."

1:03:02.570 --> 1:03:03.822
Amsterdam.

1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:06.950
Amsterdam.

1:03:07.575 --> 1:03:08.868
- This pill
has gotta be better.

1:03:08.952 --> 1:03:10.036
- Of course.

1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:12.747
- Morty, it's for the pain
and the nerves.

1:03:13.665 --> 1:03:16.209
Detective Getweiler,
you want the medicine.

1:03:16.292 --> 1:03:17.293
Let me do that for ya.

1:03:17.377 --> 1:03:18.378
-Come on.
-This hip is killing me.

1:03:18.461 --> 1:03:19.754
No, no, no. Come on. Come on.

1:03:19.838 --> 1:03:21.715
Give it to me.
Give that to me.

1:03:21.798 --> 1:03:24.050
My hip is killing me.

1:03:25.552 --> 1:03:27.053
-- There you go.

1:03:27.137 --> 1:03:29.055
- So painful.
- Please, please, please.

1:03:29.139 --> 1:03:31.182
Let me do that next time.
What are friends for?

1:03:31.266 --> 1:03:33.018
- I think
there will be no next time.

1:03:33.101 --> 1:03:34.269
Listen to me.

1:03:34.352 --> 1:03:36.396
We might have to close down
your office.

1:03:37.105 --> 1:03:39.357
Lem, close down the office?

1:03:39.441 --> 1:03:41.317
Yeah, close down
your office, yeah.

1:03:41.401 --> 1:03:42.610
We need hard evidence.

1:03:42.694 --> 1:03:45.321
Detective Hiltz, look,
you don't understand.

1:03:45.405 --> 1:03:47.198
Me and Lem, this and this.

1:03:47.282 --> 1:03:48.283
Tell him, Lem.

1:03:48.366 --> 1:03:49.868
- Exactly,
we got metal in our blood,

1:03:49.951 --> 1:03:52.370
in our brain. Imagine that.

1:03:52.454 --> 1:03:54.164
You have flat arches.

1:03:54.247 --> 1:03:56.958
You couldn't serve.
We understand.

1:03:57.042 --> 1:03:58.209
You're still
our chief suspects.

1:03:58.293 --> 1:03:59.294
- Why?

1:03:59.377 --> 1:04:02.547
Why? You know,
you know we didn't do this.

1:04:02.630 --> 1:04:03.923
No, everyone says you did it.

1:04:04.007 --> 1:04:07.010
Everyone says? Every...
There was one man.

1:04:07.093 --> 1:04:08.344
-Yeah.
-He did it.

1:04:08.428 --> 1:04:10.513
Now my captain
needs to know why you did

1:04:10.597 --> 1:04:12.640
that, uh, hush-hush autopsy
on the father.

1:04:12.724 --> 1:04:14.684
There was nothing
hush-hush about it.

1:04:14.768 --> 1:04:18.313
Liz Meekins authorized it.
Completely legal.

1:04:18.396 --> 1:04:19.689
Harold can verify that.

1:04:19.773 --> 1:04:21.024
Let's see the autopsy results.

1:04:21.107 --> 1:04:22.275
Yes, let me get the autopsy

1:04:22.358 --> 1:04:23.485
from Irma St. Clair
right in here.

1:04:23.568 --> 1:04:25.528
Excuse me, Doctor.
Overseas, I understand

1:04:25.612 --> 1:04:27.280
that they have medicines
for strength.

1:04:27.363 --> 1:04:29.199
Do you got anything here
for strength?

1:04:29.282 --> 1:04:30.909
-What?
-Power? Power.

1:04:30.992 --> 1:04:31.993
Can I get
the autopsy report...

1:04:32.077 --> 1:04:33.078
Yeah, but...

1:04:33.161 --> 1:04:34.162
-...from Irma St. Clair...
-Hiltz, wait.

1:04:34.245 --> 1:04:35.538
...one of the best autopsy
nurses in the city?

1:04:35.622 --> 1:04:36.915
- Thank you.
Yes, thank you.

1:04:37.540 --> 1:04:39.042
- Optimism.

1:04:40.001 --> 1:04:43.463
I understand we both had
a very unusual time

1:04:43.546 --> 1:04:44.923
since last we saw each other.

1:04:45.715 --> 1:04:46.716
What happened?

1:04:46.800 --> 1:04:48.802
Why is your coat
over your shoulder?

1:04:49.427 --> 1:04:50.845
That's what I wanted
to tell you.

1:04:50.929 --> 1:04:52.514
I was filing
the autopsy results

1:04:52.597 --> 1:04:53.765
when this red-faced man

1:04:53.848 --> 1:04:55.850
-with an angry face...
-Oh, God.

1:04:55.934 --> 1:04:57.977
-...and this other man...
-What happened?

1:04:58.061 --> 1:05:01.314
They threw me down,
they broke my wrist,

1:05:01.397 --> 1:05:03.608
and they took
the autopsy results.

1:05:03.691 --> 1:05:04.984
They took everything.

1:05:05.068 --> 1:05:06.778
-But it wasn't...
-That's not well done.

1:05:06.861 --> 1:05:08.029
-I know.
-That is angulated.

1:05:08.113 --> 1:05:09.155
That needs to be reset,

1:05:09.239 --> 1:05:10.657
or else
that is gonna be very bad.

1:05:10.740 --> 1:05:11.866
-Uh...

1:05:11.950 --> 1:05:12.951
-Can I?
-Okay.

1:05:13.034 --> 1:05:14.661
-Let me take your coat.
-Let me sit down. Thank you.

1:05:15.245 --> 1:05:16.871
-- Are you all right?

1:05:20.208 --> 1:05:22.752
- No, this is not...
not a good job.

1:05:22.836 --> 1:05:24.546
That's it. Hold on. Two more.

1:05:24.629 --> 1:05:26.506
One time, you were telling me

1:05:26.589 --> 1:05:28.341
whether you like
the Spanish melody...

1:05:28.424 --> 1:05:30.802
-What?
-...or was it classical?

1:05:30.885 --> 1:05:31.886
-Classical...

1:05:33.805 --> 1:05:35.765
-- That's it. That's it.

1:05:35.849 --> 1:05:37.851
-All done. It's okay.

1:05:38.476 --> 1:05:41.521
-It's okay. All right now.

1:05:41.604 --> 1:05:42.772
-Okay?
-Yes.

1:05:42.856 --> 1:05:44.732
That's it.
I gotta get a sling.

1:05:44.816 --> 1:05:47.026
-Just keep that supported.
-Yes.

1:05:47.777 --> 1:05:49.988
I'm so sorry that
you got mixed up in all this.

1:05:50.572 --> 1:05:51.698
I'm an autopsy nurse.

1:05:51.781 --> 1:05:53.575
I get mixed up
in all sorts of things.

1:05:53.658 --> 1:05:56.077
Besides, brought me closer
to you and to...

1:05:59.038 --> 1:06:00.456
They're waiting for us.

1:06:02.458 --> 1:06:03.585
Let them wait.

1:06:12.969 --> 1:06:14.387
Why is he playing music?

1:06:14.470 --> 1:06:15.471
He likes music.

1:06:15.555 --> 1:06:17.891
I don't know
why he's playing it now.

1:06:19.142 --> 1:06:20.393
Do you like this music?

1:06:21.311 --> 1:06:24.355
Me? I don't know.

1:07:10.735 --> 1:07:11.736
Beatrice.

1:07:13.905 --> 1:07:14.989
What are you doing here?

1:07:15.073 --> 1:07:16.449
Who is this woman?

1:07:18.910 --> 1:07:21.037
This is Irma.
We work together.

1:07:21.120 --> 1:07:22.372
- Mm-hmm.

1:07:23.873 --> 1:07:25.583
-She's, uh...

1:07:25.667 --> 1:07:26.918
She's an autopsy nurse.

1:07:27.001 --> 1:07:28.086
- Don't give me that.

1:07:28.836 --> 1:07:30.004
Come home.

1:07:30.588 --> 1:07:32.590
I'll defy my family
so we can be together.

1:07:32.674 --> 1:07:33.883
- Is this real?

1:07:34.926 --> 1:07:36.636
Why are you here now,
of all times?

1:07:36.719 --> 1:07:38.304
Like, you never come here.

1:07:38.388 --> 1:07:39.931
'Cause Shirley's on my side,

1:07:40.014 --> 1:07:42.225
and she calls me and tells me
when to protect my husband.

1:07:43.059 --> 1:07:44.560
My father controls
your medical license.

1:07:44.644 --> 1:07:45.979
You know that.

1:07:47.522 --> 1:07:48.564
Can you get your parents

1:07:48.648 --> 1:07:49.691
to put their names
on the committee

1:07:49.774 --> 1:07:50.775
for the gala for the veterans,

1:07:50.858 --> 1:07:53.278
so we can get respect
and dignity,

1:07:53.361 --> 1:07:54.487
and you can tell your parents

1:07:54.570 --> 1:07:58.491
that Tom Voze
might, uh, get involved?

1:07:59.158 --> 1:08:00.743
Well, uh, yes.

1:08:00.827 --> 1:08:02.412
But how will you get him?
You won't get him.

1:08:02.495 --> 1:08:03.538
I already met him.

1:08:04.789 --> 1:08:06.082
I introduced you.

1:08:06.165 --> 1:08:10.003
Well, you didn't introduce us.
You told us about him,

1:08:10.086 --> 1:08:12.422
and then me and Harold,
we met him.

1:08:13.506 --> 1:08:15.300
- Really sorry, Burt.

1:08:15.925 --> 1:08:18.219
I think you should think
about who you are

1:08:18.636 --> 1:08:20.263
and what you want to be.

1:08:32.233 --> 1:08:34.110
- Shirley. Not helpful.

1:08:34.944 --> 1:08:35.945
We need a sling!

1:08:36.029 --> 1:08:37.363
- Where are
the autopsy results?

1:08:37.447 --> 1:08:39.073
She was rolled, Lem,

1:08:39.157 --> 1:08:41.492
quite possibly by the same man

1:08:41.576 --> 1:08:43.536
-who pushed Liz Meekins.
-- I got the sling.

1:08:43.619 --> 1:08:45.121
I can give you a description.
He was about...

1:08:45.204 --> 1:08:46.372
You mean, they're stolen?

1:08:46.456 --> 1:08:47.623
Yes, they were stolen.

1:08:48.333 --> 1:08:49.751
So, what about the results?

1:08:49.834 --> 1:08:51.711
I can tell you the results.
I remember them.

1:08:51.794 --> 1:08:55.173
I found mercury, luminol,
and somnifene in his stomach,

1:08:55.256 --> 1:08:57.216
and they were in high amounts.

1:08:57.300 --> 1:08:58.885
I believe
they were given to him

1:08:58.968 --> 1:09:00.053
the last week of his life.

1:09:00.136 --> 1:09:03.222
Last week, which means
probably on the boat.

1:09:03.306 --> 1:09:05.391
So, we don't have anything
to give our captain, right?

1:09:05.975 --> 1:09:08.353
She just gave you
the evidence.

1:09:09.020 --> 1:09:11.481
I can give you an affidavit.
I do them all the time.

1:09:11.564 --> 1:09:12.648
I'm bonded by the city.

1:09:12.732 --> 1:09:13.900
How about that? Right?

1:09:13.983 --> 1:09:15.151
-I mean, we are doing...
-And certified.

1:09:15.234 --> 1:09:16.736
Yes. We're doing
your job for you.

1:09:16.819 --> 1:09:18.446
What about the dead daughter?

1:09:18.529 --> 1:09:19.530
Throw this guy in jail.

1:09:19.614 --> 1:09:20.865
Let me handle this.

1:09:20.948 --> 1:09:21.991
-Lem. Lem, Lem.
-What's this...

1:09:22.075 --> 1:09:23.076
- Please
do not touch that.

1:09:23.159 --> 1:09:24.911
-...degenerate tea set?
-That is art.

1:09:24.994 --> 1:09:26.454
You gotta get rid of this.
It's obscene.

1:09:26.537 --> 1:09:27.830
-That's art.
-No, that's not art.

1:09:27.914 --> 1:09:30.750
Art is beautiful, lovely,
evokes thoughts.

1:09:30.833 --> 1:09:31.876
That's what that is.

1:09:32.377 --> 1:09:33.795
-That's what that is?
-Yes.

1:09:33.878 --> 1:09:36.089
Why would you take a tea set,
a lovely tea set,

1:09:36.172 --> 1:09:37.924
and turn it into
an instrument of violence?

1:09:38.007 --> 1:09:39.717
-That's a good question.
-It makes no sense.

1:09:39.801 --> 1:09:42.428
Perhaps, Lem,
the question of the century.

1:09:43.596 --> 1:09:45.973
- Don't think about it too much.

1:09:46.057 --> 1:09:47.308
-Lem.
-- Burt.

1:09:47.392 --> 1:09:49.477
Lem, where is the camaraderie?

1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:51.646
We were in the Argonne.
Let's live.

1:09:51.729 --> 1:09:53.606
Voulons vivre.

1:09:53.689 --> 1:09:55.733
New pill. Remember this.

1:09:55.817 --> 1:09:56.943
Souviens-toi.

1:09:57.026 --> 1:09:58.778
-You owe me.
-Okay.

1:09:58.861 --> 1:10:00.279
But you owe me too.

1:10:01.614 --> 1:10:03.574
Get me Harold's contract
with Liz Meekins.

1:10:04.283 --> 1:10:05.410
I will.

1:10:05.493 --> 1:10:08.162
Truth is possible.

1:10:08.246 --> 1:10:10.706
And I think that love, maybe,

1:10:10.790 --> 1:10:12.834
is even possible.

1:10:12.917 --> 1:10:15.461
And this pill is working.

1:10:19.382 --> 1:10:20.716
Truth, love, what?

1:10:23.136 --> 1:10:25.680
- Harold has the car.
I only got one eye.

1:10:25.763 --> 1:10:27.849
-They don't let me drive.
-We'll find them.

1:10:27.932 --> 1:10:28.933
It's okay.

1:10:29.016 --> 1:10:31.352
Lady of Spain, I adore you

1:10:31.436 --> 1:10:33.980
Right from the night
I first saw you

1:10:34.063 --> 1:10:37.275
My heart has been
yearning for you

1:10:37.358 --> 1:10:40.445
What else could any heart do?

1:10:40.528 --> 1:10:42.238
Lady of Spain, I love you

1:10:42.321 --> 1:10:44.031
-Oh, my God.

1:10:44.115 --> 1:10:46.075
This sounds terrific. Larry.

1:10:46.159 --> 1:10:47.702
It's not canceled, right?

1:10:47.785 --> 1:10:48.786
- It's not canceled, is it?

1:10:48.870 --> 1:10:50.538
-Definitely not canceled.
-- Oh, thank you.

1:10:50.621 --> 1:10:52.999
- The reunion is a gem,
and you're gonna sing.

1:10:53.082 --> 1:10:55.126
We are going to perform!

1:10:56.711 --> 1:10:59.046
-You be careful.

1:11:00.214 --> 1:11:01.215
Milton!

1:11:02.425 --> 1:11:05.553
Harold was supposed to be
at my office hours ago.

1:11:05.636 --> 1:11:07.472
You okay? You don't look good.

1:11:08.014 --> 1:11:09.807
Things have gotten more
complicated, haven't they?

1:11:10.683 --> 1:11:13.019
You know, my grandfather
shot a guy in the face.

1:11:13.561 --> 1:11:15.271
And he got shot in the face.

1:11:15.354 --> 1:11:16.564
Separate occasions.

1:11:16.647 --> 1:11:18.232
Separate occasions.
Not the same guy.

1:11:18.858 --> 1:11:20.151
And it all worked out.

1:11:20.693 --> 1:11:22.361
-Good.
-Let's go.

1:11:22.445 --> 1:11:25.198
Dr. Burt. Burt.
I got a pinched nerve.

1:11:25.656 --> 1:11:28.326
No, I'm... I... I don't know
what to do with that yet.

1:11:28.409 --> 1:11:30.786
We can be right there.
Okay, good.

1:11:32.455 --> 1:11:35.333
Where have you been?
I've been worried sick.

1:11:35.416 --> 1:11:37.668
We went on a drive
and found out a lot of things.

1:11:38.211 --> 1:11:40.421
Well, you're not supposed
to go for a drive,

1:11:40.505 --> 1:11:43.591
when you're supposed
to meet Gil Dillenbeck.

1:11:43.674 --> 1:11:45.510
And the police
are waiting on papers

1:11:45.593 --> 1:11:47.178
that you promised them.

1:11:47.261 --> 1:11:48.471
Did someone slap you, Burt?

1:11:48.554 --> 1:11:50.223
'Cause you have a red mark
on your face.

1:11:50.306 --> 1:11:53.267
I fell,
I got slapped, I got...

1:11:53.351 --> 1:11:54.519
Carlton punched me.

1:11:54.602 --> 1:11:55.853
Yeah, I was there
for that one.

1:11:55.937 --> 1:11:57.730
We got roughed up too.

1:11:57.813 --> 1:11:59.315
We were in quite a situation.

1:11:59.398 --> 1:12:02.026
Please, not now. In the car.

1:12:02.109 --> 1:12:05.279
Milton, get these to Detective
Getweiler. All right?

1:12:05.363 --> 1:12:07.865
This is Liz Meekins's
employment contract.

1:12:07.949 --> 1:12:10.868
Did I mention that I predicted
extreme trouble

1:12:10.952 --> 1:12:12.537
from a white man in a box?

1:12:13.079 --> 1:12:16.582
Then added to
by a white woman

1:12:18.251 --> 1:12:19.252
under a truck.

1:12:19.335 --> 1:12:20.670
- The point, Milton?

1:12:20.753 --> 1:12:22.255
- You know,
I'd rather be on trial

1:12:22.338 --> 1:12:24.465
for killin' five white men

1:12:24.549 --> 1:12:25.800
than one white woman.

1:12:26.175 --> 1:12:28.594
'Cause this can lead
to one Black man

1:12:28.678 --> 1:12:30.680
or more dead in a box.

1:12:31.389 --> 1:12:32.932
- Please, let's get going.

1:12:33.015 --> 1:12:35.810
We should've left
for Dillenbeck's hours ago.

1:12:36.269 --> 1:12:38.020
That's the only hope
that we have

1:12:38.104 --> 1:12:40.273
to get out of this situation
with the police.

1:12:41.065 --> 1:12:42.191
- Why are we
stopping here?

1:12:42.275 --> 1:12:43.401
This is not Bucks County.

1:12:43.484 --> 1:12:44.694
This is not even
out of the city.

1:12:44.777 --> 1:12:46.904
- We're making
a quick stop at the Waldorf.

1:12:46.988 --> 1:12:48.155
- Is Dillenbeck
at the Waldorf?

1:12:48.239 --> 1:12:49.407
- We're not here
to see Dillenbeck.

1:12:49.490 --> 1:12:50.491
- What are you
talking about?

1:12:50.575 --> 1:12:52.118
What are we doing here?
Harold, Valerie!

1:12:53.077 --> 1:12:54.078
Unbelievable!

1:12:54.161 --> 1:12:55.246
Welcome to
the Waldorf Astoria, sir.

1:12:55.329 --> 1:12:56.330
How long will...

1:12:56.414 --> 1:12:57.582
We're not staying
at the Waldorf.

1:12:57.665 --> 1:12:59.584
We had one thing
to do today, Harold.

1:12:59.667 --> 1:13:01.752
One thing.
Try to talk to Gil Dillenbeck.

1:13:01.836 --> 1:13:03.337
And maybe have an event
with a modicum...

1:13:03.421 --> 1:13:05.131
-This is my situation...
-...of dignity and...

1:13:05.214 --> 1:13:06.424
...from my past
that we saw today, Burt.

1:13:06.507 --> 1:13:08.467
And it's my peace of mind
that's been twisted, Burt.

1:13:08.551 --> 1:13:09.844
Dillenbeck can't help us

1:13:09.927 --> 1:13:11.137
until we know
what's really going on.

1:13:11.220 --> 1:13:12.722
Well, what is going on?

1:13:12.805 --> 1:13:14.682
I don't know,
but we're gonna find out.

1:13:14.765 --> 1:13:15.766
Give me the keys.

1:13:15.850 --> 1:13:16.851
-Absolutely not.
-Give me the keys.

1:13:16.934 --> 1:13:18.185
You're not driving.
You can't drive,

1:13:18.269 --> 1:13:19.437
you one-eyed nut.

1:13:20.688 --> 1:13:22.356
Harold, this is not smart.

1:13:23.482 --> 1:13:26.986
- At least, just tell me
who we're seeing here.

1:13:27.612 --> 1:13:28.988
Paul Canterbury.

1:13:30.156 --> 1:13:31.282
Paul Canterbury?

1:13:31.741 --> 1:13:33.534
-Yeah. Yeah.
-The glass-eye guy?

1:13:33.618 --> 1:13:35.494
From Amsterdam.
The benefactor?

1:13:36.037 --> 1:13:37.496
She still talks to them, Burt.

1:13:40.541 --> 1:13:43.377
-Hello, Paul.
-Oh, Valerie, how are you?

1:13:43.461 --> 1:13:44.503
There you are.

1:13:45.546 --> 1:13:46.547
Harold.

1:13:46.631 --> 1:13:47.840
Paul Canterbury.

1:13:48.341 --> 1:13:50.009
- Berendsen, how are you?

1:13:51.052 --> 1:13:54.221
Here you go. Dark hazel green.

1:13:54.847 --> 1:13:56.599
-Eh.
-- Box of six.

1:13:57.558 --> 1:13:58.684
Very kind of you. Thank you.

1:14:00.269 --> 1:14:01.270
- Ah!

1:14:01.771 --> 1:14:02.938
It's teatime.

1:14:04.106 --> 1:14:06.192
Is it just me
who fancies claret?

1:14:06.275 --> 1:14:07.985
I like to have it
going in one hand

1:14:08.069 --> 1:14:09.111
and tea in the other.

1:14:09.195 --> 1:14:11.197
We're in a bit
of a predicament, Paul.

1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:12.907
Thank you for taking the time
to see us.

1:14:12.990 --> 1:14:14.825
Valerie, we're prepared

1:14:15.409 --> 1:14:18.245
to do anything we must
as gentlemen.

1:14:18.329 --> 1:14:19.413
-- You bounder!

1:14:19.497 --> 1:14:21.540
-You cheat! You disgust me!

1:14:21.624 --> 1:14:23.459
History will redeem me.

1:14:23.542 --> 1:14:24.543
Like hell it will.

1:14:25.544 --> 1:14:27.004
- Sorry, everyone.

1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:31.342
It's all right. Drinks on me.
Literally.

1:14:33.469 --> 1:14:35.012
- Hello.
This way, please.

1:14:37.723 --> 1:14:40.351
You remember Henry Norcross?
He's the American...

1:14:40.434 --> 1:14:41.852
- Federal employee
they don't need

1:14:41.936 --> 1:14:43.979
to talk about, or I trust
they wouldn't be here.

1:14:45.356 --> 1:14:47.525
What does all of this
have to do with

1:14:47.608 --> 1:14:49.985
a "glass business" in England

1:14:50.486 --> 1:14:53.030
and, uh,
financing in Washington?

1:14:53.114 --> 1:14:54.323
Well, they overlap.

1:14:54.407 --> 1:14:55.616
Lots of things overlap,
Berendsen.

1:14:55.700 --> 1:14:57.451
The whole world
overlaps in its most

1:14:58.035 --> 1:15:00.204
treacherous way
if you pay attention.

1:15:00.287 --> 1:15:03.374
And hello, Burt,
Harold, Valerie.

1:15:03.457 --> 1:15:05.126
-Hello, Henry.
-You're looking good, Henry.

1:15:05.209 --> 1:15:08.045
It's good to see you too
as we gather here once more

1:15:08.129 --> 1:15:10.548
on the right side
of history. Huh?

1:15:10.631 --> 1:15:13.676
Paul, I understand you had
a drink thrown in your face

1:15:13.759 --> 1:15:15.803
-in the tea court just now.
-- Yes.

1:15:15.886 --> 1:15:18.013
Just some old business
from England, Henry.

1:15:18.097 --> 1:15:19.348
No, no, no.
A drink in your face

1:15:19.432 --> 1:15:20.474
is a drink in my face.

1:15:20.558 --> 1:15:21.600
I'd like to hear
about it, please.

1:15:21.684 --> 1:15:23.227
Then we'll get on
to new business.

1:15:23.310 --> 1:15:24.395
It was someone from

1:15:24.937 --> 1:15:26.897
the Ornithological Society
of Great Britain.

1:15:26.981 --> 1:15:28.941
Ah, one of those
rotten bastards, huh?

1:15:29.024 --> 1:15:31.360
-Yeah.

1:15:33.028 --> 1:15:34.029
What?

1:15:34.739 --> 1:15:37.742
I was told a story
about a misdeed

1:15:37.825 --> 1:15:39.535
in the bird society
of England.

1:15:40.327 --> 1:15:43.414
And I'm starting to wonder
if that story is about you.

1:15:43.497 --> 1:15:46.125
Our discovery
was hardly trivial.

1:15:46.208 --> 1:15:47.710
Yes, we proved that the cuckoo

1:15:47.793 --> 1:15:49.795
lacks the capacity,
the civility,

1:15:49.879 --> 1:15:51.422
the character
to build its own nest.

1:15:51.505 --> 1:15:52.506
- Wow.

1:15:53.257 --> 1:15:55.634
How is that
possibly significant

1:15:55.718 --> 1:15:58.804
or interesting
to anybody or anything?

1:15:58.888 --> 1:15:59.930
- Because it shows
that the cuckoo

1:16:00.014 --> 1:16:01.474
is a parasitic bird.

1:16:01.557 --> 1:16:04.101
It tricks better birds
who build nests.

1:16:04.185 --> 1:16:06.687
Cuckoo destroys
the host's eggs,

1:16:06.771 --> 1:16:08.481
and then destroys
the nest itself.

1:16:08.564 --> 1:16:11.358
Berendsen, the cuckoo doesn't
give a damn. Okay?

1:16:11.442 --> 1:16:13.027
I'd say
it's a profound statement

1:16:13.110 --> 1:16:15.988
on the parasitic destructive
behavior of nature,

1:16:16.071 --> 1:16:17.740
-including humans.
-Hear, hear.

1:16:17.823 --> 1:16:20.534
That is especially true
after what we saw today.

1:16:21.243 --> 1:16:22.244
- Burt,
it's the story about

1:16:22.328 --> 1:16:23.662
what happened to us.
Listen up.

1:16:23.746 --> 1:16:25.289
We have been trying
to tell you, Burt.

1:16:25.372 --> 1:16:27.625
And I think Paul and Henry
should hear this too.

1:16:27.708 --> 1:16:30.085
But we ended up at
a very strange clinic today

1:16:30.169 --> 1:16:31.504
and we found this.

1:16:33.631 --> 1:16:35.382
Those symbols were everywhere.

1:16:36.342 --> 1:16:37.843
Have you seen it before?

1:16:37.927 --> 1:16:39.345
The Committee of the Five.

1:16:41.388 --> 1:16:43.599
I went to see Valerie
as we'd arranged,

1:16:43.682 --> 1:16:46.310
but then we noticed
somebody was watching us.

1:16:46.393 --> 1:16:48.145
- Someone was watching
us through the curtains.

1:16:48.938 --> 1:16:51.148
That's the man
who pushed Liz Meekins.

1:16:51.690 --> 1:16:53.192
And he must've got
bored waiting

1:16:53.275 --> 1:16:54.318
because he started to leave,

1:16:54.401 --> 1:16:56.028
and then we decided
to follow him.

1:16:56.111 --> 1:16:57.822
And he led us
to Rockland County.

1:16:58.739 --> 1:17:00.783
- To an unmarked
brick building.

1:17:09.750 --> 1:17:11.544
They assumed that we were
patients for a procedure.

1:17:11.627 --> 1:17:13.128
- To be sterilized.

1:17:13.212 --> 1:17:15.256
- Ah,
a forced sterilization clinic.

1:17:15.339 --> 1:17:16.757
- Then I saw the man.

1:17:16.841 --> 1:17:19.718
This red-faced man. The man
who pushed Liz Meekins.

1:17:19.802 --> 1:17:21.428
He looked right at me,
and he said...

1:17:21.512 --> 1:17:24.014
This is your moment
to end your inferiority.

1:17:24.098 --> 1:17:25.683
You're gonna
have that procedure.

1:17:30.980 --> 1:17:32.147
Don't move!

1:17:34.275 --> 1:17:35.568
-Shit.

1:17:38.028 --> 1:17:39.405
- Somebody
call the captain!

1:17:41.657 --> 1:17:43.117
-Come on.
-- Stop those people!

1:17:43.200 --> 1:17:45.035
- Help! We need help!
- Call the captain!

1:17:46.996 --> 1:17:48.539
- Well, when Valerie's
gun finally went off,

1:17:48.622 --> 1:17:50.082
it hit a glass,
and we got out of there

1:17:50.165 --> 1:17:51.792
-and headed back to the city.
-- My God.

1:17:52.543 --> 1:17:54.753
Well, I'm glad
you're all right.

1:17:54.837 --> 1:17:56.088
But if you didn't get

1:17:56.171 --> 1:17:58.132
the red-faced killer's
identification,

1:17:58.674 --> 1:18:00.426
then it's of no help,
whatsoever.

1:18:00.509 --> 1:18:01.844
What are you
talking about, Burt?

1:18:01.927 --> 1:18:03.387
It has everything to do
with everything.

1:18:03.470 --> 1:18:04.805
Today, that what happened,
has to...

1:18:04.889 --> 1:18:05.973
-How?
-It starts with me.

1:18:06.056 --> 1:18:07.141
Well, it starts with me.

1:18:08.017 --> 1:18:10.519
I told some friends
in Longview, Texas,

1:18:10.603 --> 1:18:12.605
not to visit
this very horrifying clinic,

1:18:12.688 --> 1:18:14.481
a lot like the one
we saw today.

1:18:15.274 --> 1:18:17.484
A mob.
A mob of white men chased me.

1:18:17.568 --> 1:18:19.153
They harassed me.
They tried to kill me.

1:18:19.236 --> 1:18:22.239
They were unsuccessful.
They were very unsuccessful.

1:18:22.323 --> 1:18:24.658
I left Longview, Texas,
and I never looked back.

1:18:26.285 --> 1:18:28.537
It's not just about you
and Texas,

1:18:28.621 --> 1:18:30.080
nor today in Rockland.

1:18:31.373 --> 1:18:32.458
There is an organization

1:18:32.541 --> 1:18:34.960
that wishes to do this
all over the world.

1:18:36.420 --> 1:18:37.630
What does it mean?

1:18:38.797 --> 1:18:40.549
It means there's a cabal
in this country

1:18:40.633 --> 1:18:41.926
tied to another in Germany

1:18:42.009 --> 1:18:44.011
who supports these clinics,

1:18:45.137 --> 1:18:46.597
who want to rule the world.

1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:49.183
Rule the world?

1:18:50.935 --> 1:18:52.227
Exactly correct.

1:18:53.812 --> 1:18:55.272
Who's in the cabal?

1:18:55.689 --> 1:18:57.107
- Maybe who

1:18:57.650 --> 1:19:01.028
is the wrong question to ask.
Instead ask why.

1:19:02.863 --> 1:19:03.864
Go see Dillenbeck.

1:19:04.615 --> 1:19:07.201
Ask him why his fellow,
General Meekins,

1:19:07.284 --> 1:19:08.452
was murdered.

1:19:08.535 --> 1:19:13.082
Dillenbeck, he's been
leading on this cabal

1:19:13.165 --> 1:19:16.001
to find out who they are,
what they plan.

1:19:17.211 --> 1:19:19.046
Committee of the Five.

1:19:20.547 --> 1:19:22.549
The organization named
Der Fünf.

1:19:23.384 --> 1:19:24.385
Committee of the Five.

1:19:24.468 --> 1:19:25.761
Trying to figure out
who they are.

1:19:25.844 --> 1:19:27.262
Committee of the Five.

1:19:27.346 --> 1:19:28.681
-- Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:19:28.764 --> 1:19:29.807
I think it would be wonderful

1:19:29.890 --> 1:19:32.184
if Dillenbeck was the speaker
at your reunion.

1:19:33.811 --> 1:19:36.939
Seems your event's becoming
rather important, Berendsen.

1:19:37.982 --> 1:19:40.192
If you can get
Dillenbeck to speak,

1:19:40.275 --> 1:19:41.986
perhaps it might attract

1:19:42.069 --> 1:19:43.946
more influential members
of the cabal.

1:19:44.029 --> 1:19:45.447
Yeah, the killer
from the street

1:19:45.531 --> 1:19:47.783
or the higher-ups
paying for it all.

1:19:47.866 --> 1:19:48.993
- Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1:19:49.660 --> 1:19:53.080
No. I don't want our event,

1:19:53.163 --> 1:19:55.457
Harold's and my event,

1:19:55.541 --> 1:19:59.044
to be used like this
by anybody.

1:19:59.128 --> 1:20:00.879
Used? No.

1:20:02.172 --> 1:20:04.967
Think of it as protecting
what you love.

1:20:05.050 --> 1:20:06.176
Okay?

1:20:07.094 --> 1:20:08.846
We told you in Amsterdam
we'd come a-calling,

1:20:08.929 --> 1:20:09.930
and here we are.

1:20:10.806 --> 1:20:11.974
And here you are.

1:20:15.060 --> 1:20:16.395
Well, we done here?

1:20:17.771 --> 1:20:19.606
Or you wanna talk more
about birds?

1:20:19.690 --> 1:20:21.692
You know, a lot of people
assume that it's about

1:20:21.775 --> 1:20:24.862
the, uh... the tranquility
or the communion with nature.

1:20:24.945 --> 1:20:27.573
But I find bird-watching
so fascinating

1:20:27.656 --> 1:20:30.492
because it forces you
to decide

1:20:30.576 --> 1:20:32.786
what you are looking at.

1:20:34.288 --> 1:20:36.874
I am honing
my art of discernment.

1:20:36.957 --> 1:20:38.625
And I want you to trust me

1:20:38.709 --> 1:20:41.253
that I believe
now is the time to intervene.

1:20:41.336 --> 1:20:43.964
We get Gil Dillenbeck to be
the speaker at this event,

1:20:44.048 --> 1:20:45.758
he will be the magnet
that draws

1:20:45.841 --> 1:20:47.384
all the nails out of the wood

1:20:47.468 --> 1:20:50.262
and brings
this house of treachery

1:20:50.345 --> 1:20:51.430
down to the ground.

1:20:51.513 --> 1:20:52.931
So what do you say, Burt?
Please.

1:20:55.142 --> 1:20:56.560
- Please try, Burt.

1:21:02.149 --> 1:21:03.609
I don't like to say,
"I told you so,"

1:21:03.692 --> 1:21:04.943
but this is all
turning out to be

1:21:05.027 --> 1:21:07.237
a lot larger than
any of us imagined.

1:21:07.321 --> 1:21:08.405
Yeah.

1:21:08.489 --> 1:21:10.616
If the gala is used by Paul...

1:21:10.699 --> 1:21:12.034
-Are you okay?
-You good?

1:21:12.117 --> 1:21:14.620
Mm-hmm. Fine.
It comes and goes. I'm fine.

1:21:14.703 --> 1:21:15.704
Yeah?

1:21:16.246 --> 1:21:18.332
You feel fine,
then all of a sudden,

1:21:18.916 --> 1:21:21.001
vertigo, you get dizzy...

1:21:21.085 --> 1:21:22.336
It comes and goes.

1:21:22.419 --> 1:21:24.838
First, they told me
that I had epilepsy.

1:21:24.922 --> 1:21:27.341
I'd never had a seizure,
but they said I had epilepsy,

1:21:27.424 --> 1:21:29.218
and the seizures would come
sooner or later.

1:21:29.301 --> 1:21:31.970
But that could be avoided
if I took medication.

1:21:32.054 --> 1:21:33.138
And so I did.

1:21:33.931 --> 1:21:36.141
And then I started having
other symptoms, more symptoms,

1:21:36.225 --> 1:21:37.559
and they said,
"That's hereditary.

1:21:37.643 --> 1:21:38.811
"That's from
your mother's side."

1:21:38.894 --> 1:21:40.062
So they gave me
new medications,

1:21:40.145 --> 1:21:41.355
and I kept taking that.

1:21:41.438 --> 1:21:43.190
And now years and years
have gone by

1:21:43.273 --> 1:21:44.650
and I'm barely
leaving the house,

1:21:44.733 --> 1:21:47.236
and I feel like I'm a patient,
and I can't live,

1:21:47.319 --> 1:21:50.072
and I... I'm starting
to question all of it.

1:22:16.723 --> 1:22:17.724
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1:22:17.808 --> 1:22:19.017
No, don't touch me.
Don't hold me.

1:22:19.101 --> 1:22:21.311
I'm fine. I can do this,
and I just need...

1:22:21.854 --> 1:22:23.480
I just need a minute here
to rest, just...

1:22:25.399 --> 1:22:26.900
-Oh, God. You good?
-Bitch.

1:22:26.984 --> 1:22:27.985
-Valerie.
-Oh, yes.

1:22:28.068 --> 1:22:29.403
I'm fine.

1:22:30.112 --> 1:22:31.572
Look, I'm doing stairs.

1:22:31.655 --> 1:22:33.824
I can go up stairs
with no vertigo.

1:22:33.907 --> 1:22:37.411
No vertigo.
I'm fine. I can run.

1:22:37.494 --> 1:22:38.495
-Oh, my... Valerie!
-Valerie!

1:22:39.663 --> 1:22:40.747
Collect that drunk woman
and go!

1:22:40.831 --> 1:22:41.832
- We know the general.

1:22:41.915 --> 1:22:43.041
-We have pictures.
-- I'm all right, damn it.

1:22:43.125 --> 1:22:45.460
MRS.- There,
I don't want the pictures.

1:22:45.544 --> 1:22:47.254
-Go, now!
-I'm a doctor.

1:22:47.337 --> 1:22:48.547
-Go now.
-And I am a veteran.

1:22:48.630 --> 1:22:49.840
-You're gonna need a doctor...
-Thank you.

1:22:49.923 --> 1:22:51.550
-...when I'm through with you.
-Breathe. Just breathe.

1:22:51.633 --> 1:22:52.968
Now, go or I'm gonna
call the police.

1:22:53.051 --> 1:22:54.303
-- Just a few minutes...
-No, I've got it. I do.

1:22:54.386 --> 1:22:55.554
-...of your husband's time.
-MRS.- No.

1:22:55.637 --> 1:22:56.889
- I have to fight
through these symptoms

1:22:56.972 --> 1:22:57.973
-at some point.
-- There goes...

1:22:58.056 --> 1:22:59.266
- I'm not getting
depressed about it.

1:22:59.349 --> 1:23:01.143
- ...our one chance
to clear our names.

1:23:01.226 --> 1:23:03.645
You have to change your
medicine and your doctor.

1:23:04.146 --> 1:23:07.316
Son of a bitch.
I was fine.

1:23:09.151 --> 1:23:10.777
Maybe it's time for me
to leave anyway.

1:23:10.861 --> 1:23:12.154
- What do you mean,
leave?

1:23:12.237 --> 1:23:13.530
- Well,
even if we solve Meekins

1:23:13.614 --> 1:23:14.615
out of the three of us,

1:23:14.698 --> 1:23:16.033
I'm the one
that's going to jail.

1:23:16.116 --> 1:23:18.076
-The system's rigged.
-- Harold.

1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:21.705
I told you from the get-go,
this job was a bad idea.

1:23:21.788 --> 1:23:26.460
Milton told you
this job was a bad idea...

1:23:29.129 --> 1:23:30.881
but she had to get us hired.

1:23:30.964 --> 1:23:32.674
Oh, "she"? "She had to get..."

1:23:33.759 --> 1:23:35.135
"She" also got you
out of jail,

1:23:35.219 --> 1:23:36.345
which you seem
to forget a lot.

1:23:36.428 --> 1:23:38.347
You can't turn your backs
on me now.

1:23:38.805 --> 1:23:40.641
You broke the pact, remember?

1:23:41.058 --> 1:23:42.935
I broke the pact? When?

1:23:43.435 --> 1:23:45.103
We told you
not to leave, Burt.

1:23:46.647 --> 1:23:50.400
At least you found love,
even if you can't get it.

1:23:50.484 --> 1:23:51.777
I've never been lucky enough

1:23:51.860 --> 1:23:53.237
to even know
what the hell it is.

1:23:53.737 --> 1:23:55.572
And that's
a terrible affliction

1:23:55.656 --> 1:23:56.823
I don't wish on anyone.

1:23:58.033 --> 1:23:59.701
I wish I never did find it.

1:24:00.661 --> 1:24:02.371
Because it hurts too much.

1:24:04.957 --> 1:24:06.124
MRS.- Wait!

1:24:06.208 --> 1:24:08.752
The general wants to meet you.

1:24:11.255 --> 1:24:12.589
Don't screw this up.

1:24:12.673 --> 1:24:13.966
-Straighten up.
-MRS.- Come on!

1:24:14.049 --> 1:24:15.300
Help me walk.

1:24:15.384 --> 1:24:16.385
MRS.- I'm sorry

1:24:16.468 --> 1:24:17.761
about the misunderstanding
before.

1:24:17.844 --> 1:24:19.221
Never mind. Never mind.

1:24:19.304 --> 1:24:22.224
MRS.- We get
so many uninvited guests here.

1:24:22.307 --> 1:24:24.768
-Of course.
-People we don't want to see.

1:24:24.851 --> 1:24:26.603
-I'm sorry.
-Thank you.

1:24:26.687 --> 1:24:28.063
I'm not drunk.

1:24:28.146 --> 1:24:29.398
MRS.-
Uh, young lady,

1:24:29.481 --> 1:24:31.566
what is wrong with you?
Are you all right?

1:24:31.650 --> 1:24:33.986
It's a touch of vertigo
and a couple of other...

1:24:34.069 --> 1:24:35.821
I'm coming off
some medication at the moment.

1:24:35.904 --> 1:24:37.155
I had vertigo once

1:24:37.239 --> 1:24:39.741
and the world
just keeps moving.

1:24:39.825 --> 1:24:40.826
I'd offer you a drink,

1:24:40.909 --> 1:24:42.494
but we don't keep
alcohol in the house.

1:24:42.577 --> 1:24:43.578
Oh, that's fine.

1:24:46.164 --> 1:24:49.543
You can put your
hat and coats over there.

1:24:50.460 --> 1:24:51.878
You're going up this way.

1:24:51.962 --> 1:24:53.839
Are we jumping ahead
of another visitor?

1:24:53.922 --> 1:24:57.551
Oh, Mr. Maguire comes every
month to discuss something

1:24:57.634 --> 1:25:00.304
my husband can never get
a clear answer about.

1:25:00.387 --> 1:25:01.805
Right, Mr. Maguire?

1:25:01.888 --> 1:25:02.889
- Ah.

1:25:05.475 --> 1:25:07.060
MRS.-
What do I know?

1:25:07.144 --> 1:25:09.438
I'm just trying
to make bouillabaisse

1:25:09.521 --> 1:25:12.316
because the general
had it once in France.

1:25:14.401 --> 1:25:17.154
General?
Your visitors are here.

1:25:17.654 --> 1:25:19.448
You call your husband
"General"?

1:25:19.531 --> 1:25:21.408
Only on the weekdays.

1:25:22.034 --> 1:25:23.577
What do you call him
on weekends?

1:25:24.453 --> 1:25:27.289
That's a very
personal question.

1:25:27.956 --> 1:25:28.957
Were you taught no manners?

1:25:29.041 --> 1:25:30.042
Don't blame me
for getting us kicked out.

1:25:30.125 --> 1:25:31.960
-I didn't mean anything by it.
-Are you nervous?

1:25:32.711 --> 1:25:34.296
She's pulling everybody's leg
half the time.

1:25:34.379 --> 1:25:35.422
That's why I love her.

1:25:35.505 --> 1:25:37.257
What an honor, sir.

1:25:37.341 --> 1:25:38.925
Um, was it the pictures
that made you

1:25:39.009 --> 1:25:40.218
change your mind
about seeing us?

1:25:41.053 --> 1:25:43.513
How can I know this is you,
really, in the picture?

1:25:44.848 --> 1:25:45.849
- Uh, yes, sir.

1:25:45.932 --> 1:25:47.809
So, well, I'm the doctor.

1:25:47.893 --> 1:25:49.770
She's the nurse.
He's the attorney.

1:25:49.853 --> 1:25:51.313
We all met in Belgium,

1:25:51.396 --> 1:25:52.397
which, if you recall,

1:25:52.481 --> 1:25:54.483
is where we met
for the first time.

1:25:54.566 --> 1:25:55.942
As well as Washington,

1:25:56.026 --> 1:25:57.861
last summer,
at the B.E.F. March.

1:25:58.820 --> 1:26:02.449
I'll tell you one thing that
I can remember quite clearly.

1:26:03.158 --> 1:26:04.868
You did something that...

1:26:05.994 --> 1:26:09.081
You sang a song, I believe.

1:26:10.374 --> 1:26:11.500
Which... Which one, sir?

1:26:11.583 --> 1:26:13.335
- Well,
that's for you to remember.

1:26:13.418 --> 1:26:16.963
I met thousands of people.
You just met me twice.

1:26:17.047 --> 1:26:19.049
So, you should
remember the song.

1:26:20.592 --> 1:26:22.761
I'd like you to sing it now,
then I'll know it's you.

1:26:23.637 --> 1:26:24.679
Sing a song.

1:26:24.763 --> 1:26:25.764
Did you ever
see a dream

1:26:25.847 --> 1:26:27.057
-Dream walking?
-Walking?

1:26:27.140 --> 1:26:28.266
Well, I did

1:26:28.392 --> 1:26:29.393
Yes...

1:26:29.476 --> 1:26:30.977
Did you ever hear a dream...
Talking?

1:26:31.061 --> 1:26:32.062
See... Right.

1:26:32.145 --> 1:26:33.146
Then I did

1:26:33.230 --> 1:26:34.731
Oh, no, no.
That's... That's not it.

1:26:35.732 --> 1:26:38.318
Um... Was it in French?

1:26:38.402 --> 1:26:39.820
I'll know it when I hear it.

1:27:05.262 --> 1:27:07.806
Yes. That was it.

1:27:08.390 --> 1:27:09.516
That's right.

1:27:09.599 --> 1:27:11.017
We made it up.

1:27:11.101 --> 1:27:12.602
Well, it's not supposed
to make sense.

1:27:12.686 --> 1:27:14.438
It's just a nonsense song.

1:27:15.105 --> 1:27:16.815
-But it makes us feel good.

1:27:16.898 --> 1:27:18.733
-And you're the doctor?
-- That's right, sir.

1:27:18.817 --> 1:27:22.279
And you evacuated
4,000 men in one day.

1:27:22.362 --> 1:27:23.613
You're very famous.

1:27:24.030 --> 1:27:25.073
Different doctor.

1:27:26.158 --> 1:27:29.661
That's the social guy
from San Francisco.

1:27:30.370 --> 1:27:31.371
Story of my life.

1:27:32.414 --> 1:27:33.415
Not you?

1:27:33.498 --> 1:27:34.916
Burt and I did evacuate

1:27:34.999 --> 1:27:37.127
a couple of thousand men
in one day, though, sir.

1:27:37.210 --> 1:27:41.131
And you, sir, you stabbed
30 Germans with your knife,

1:27:41.214 --> 1:27:43.091
and they called you
"Black Death"?

1:27:43.175 --> 1:27:45.177
No, sir, that was
Black Death Henry Johnson.

1:27:45.260 --> 1:27:46.928
But I did get 12 of 'em

1:27:47.012 --> 1:27:48.930
-before they gave me this.
-- Oh.

1:27:49.014 --> 1:27:50.724
I also saved a lot of lives.

1:27:50.807 --> 1:27:51.933
-- You did?
-Yeah.

1:27:52.434 --> 1:27:55.312
Well, that's something
to be proud of.

1:27:55.395 --> 1:27:58.607
It's shameful they made you
wear those French uniforms.

1:27:58.690 --> 1:28:00.358
You should wear
your own country's uniform.

1:28:00.442 --> 1:28:03.069
From your mouth
to God's ears, sir. Thank you.

1:28:04.529 --> 1:28:06.072
So, uh, General?

1:28:07.741 --> 1:28:08.742
Bill Meekins.

1:28:09.326 --> 1:28:12.245
Well, Bill Meekins
was a friend of mine,

1:28:12.329 --> 1:28:14.206
and it's a tragedy

1:28:14.289 --> 1:28:15.874
what happened to him
and his daughter.

1:28:15.957 --> 1:28:18.043
And it's a disgrace
that no one cares.

1:28:18.126 --> 1:28:20.003
-Oh, we care.
-Indeed.

1:28:20.086 --> 1:28:22.964
The late Elizabeth Meekins
hired us, actually.

1:28:23.048 --> 1:28:24.257
She hired you? Why?

1:28:24.841 --> 1:28:27.385
She didn't believe that her
father died of natural causes.

1:28:27.469 --> 1:28:29.095
On his way back from Europe.

1:28:29.179 --> 1:28:30.889
The last time
I spoke to my friend,

1:28:30.972 --> 1:28:32.224
he called me from Rome.

1:28:32.724 --> 1:28:34.309
Called me from the hotel.

1:28:34.768 --> 1:28:37.521
Told me of something monstrous
that he had seen.

1:28:38.146 --> 1:28:39.856
Disturbed him greatly.

1:28:40.815 --> 1:28:43.693
That was why Bill was killed.

1:28:48.490 --> 1:28:50.700
You see the man downstairs
when you came in?

1:28:51.993 --> 1:28:53.245
Every couple of weeks,

1:28:53.328 --> 1:28:54.996
he comes and he brings...

1:28:55.080 --> 1:28:56.748
-Did you see a bag?
-- Mm-hmm.

1:28:56.831 --> 1:28:59.709
A bag of money
he offers to me.

1:29:00.168 --> 1:29:01.378
Money for what?

1:29:02.837 --> 1:29:04.172
To give a speech.

1:29:05.423 --> 1:29:08.009
He won't tell me
who's behind him. I ask him.

1:29:09.052 --> 1:29:10.387
And say, "Who's this from?"

1:29:10.470 --> 1:29:11.596
And he doesn't
give me an answer.

1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:13.348
They're paying you
to be their mouthpiece.

1:29:13.431 --> 1:29:14.641
That's right, exactly.

1:29:14.724 --> 1:29:17.060
And they know
the veterans will follow.

1:29:17.936 --> 1:29:19.104
- The Committee
of the Five.

1:29:19.563 --> 1:29:21.064
Well, somebody is trying to do

1:29:21.147 --> 1:29:22.774
something dark
and treacherous.

1:29:26.194 --> 1:29:27.195
Come here.

1:29:28.196 --> 1:29:29.948
Ask him
if he'll speak at the gala.

1:29:30.031 --> 1:29:31.992
Push it further.
Like Henry said.

1:29:32.659 --> 1:29:35.245
Sir, um, if these guys

1:29:35.328 --> 1:29:36.913
-are meeting you...
-Hmm.

1:29:36.997 --> 1:29:40.375
...and you wanna find out
who's behind it all,

1:29:40.458 --> 1:29:41.918
why not go further

1:29:42.502 --> 1:29:46.172
and lead them
to our reunion gala event?

1:29:46.256 --> 1:29:49.217
They might show themselves
in some fashion.

1:29:56.349 --> 1:29:58.977
Maguire, can you tell me,
why do you come every month?

1:29:59.477 --> 1:30:01.062
Well, General,
I can't speak about it

1:30:01.146 --> 1:30:02.230
in front of other people.

1:30:02.314 --> 1:30:04.899
Well, why not? I mean, you say
there's nothing to hide.

1:30:04.983 --> 1:30:06.901
And it's in the name
of a good cause.

1:30:06.985 --> 1:30:09.195
Well, yes, sir. But not
everyone understands it.

1:30:09.279 --> 1:30:10.488
What I don't understand

1:30:10.572 --> 1:30:11.948
is who or what you represent.

1:30:13.116 --> 1:30:14.159
Can you tell me?

1:30:15.785 --> 1:30:19.039
Well, I'm not at liberty
to say who I represent, sir.

1:30:19.122 --> 1:30:20.915
Uh, but they are
very important people,

1:30:20.999 --> 1:30:22.792
and they have a very
important organization

1:30:22.876 --> 1:30:24.711
that's gonna change everything
for the better.

1:30:25.462 --> 1:30:28.006
The purpose,
as I've told you, sir,

1:30:28.089 --> 1:30:29.424
is to lead
this nation properly

1:30:29.507 --> 1:30:31.176
in this time
of economic crisis.

1:30:31.259 --> 1:30:33.178
There's a cripple
in the White House.

1:30:33.637 --> 1:30:36.222
Roosevelt is weak.
We'd like you to speak

1:30:36.306 --> 1:30:39.059
on behalf of the veterans
and new leadership.

1:30:39.142 --> 1:30:41.227
Well, that's what elections
are for, Maguire.

1:30:41.311 --> 1:30:42.854
Don't you believe
in the Constitution?

1:30:43.355 --> 1:30:46.566
Of course, but we feel that
action is urgently needed now.

1:30:47.233 --> 1:30:49.819
From a retired general
before the election?

1:30:49.903 --> 1:30:51.404
Do you want me
to be a dictator?

1:30:51.488 --> 1:30:53.490
Is that what
your big sponsors want?

1:30:55.742 --> 1:30:56.910
Uh, a... A dictator?

1:30:56.993 --> 1:30:59.245
No, it doesn't
have to be said like that.

1:30:59.329 --> 1:31:02.374
Okay, chancellor?
Does that make it better?

1:31:02.457 --> 1:31:04.334
It still violates
the Constitution.

1:31:04.417 --> 1:31:06.920
- They did this with
veterans in Germany and Italy.

1:31:07.003 --> 1:31:08.129
Very successful.

1:31:12.175 --> 1:31:13.385
18,000, sir,

1:31:13.468 --> 1:31:15.178
from the Committee
of the Five.

1:31:15.261 --> 1:31:16.262
Uh, Committee
for a Sound Dollar.

1:31:16.346 --> 1:31:17.597
-From who?
-- Committee of the Five?

1:31:18.139 --> 1:31:19.516
Committee for a Sound Dollar.

1:31:22.894 --> 1:31:25.230
The nation needs
your leadership.

1:31:25.313 --> 1:31:27.023
Do you see
where I'm going, sir?

1:31:30.610 --> 1:31:31.653
- Mr. Maguire,

1:31:31.986 --> 1:31:32.987
I've changed my mind.

1:31:33.071 --> 1:31:34.739
I've decided
I will do the speech.

1:31:35.115 --> 1:31:36.658
This is very exciting.

1:31:37.283 --> 1:31:39.786
I'll choose the event.
I'm most comfortable

1:31:40.328 --> 1:31:42.414
speaking with the veterans
Bill Meekins knew

1:31:42.497 --> 1:31:44.958
from the regiment he created.
I'll speak at their reunion.

1:31:45.375 --> 1:31:46.459
- Of course, but...

1:31:46.543 --> 1:31:47.794
Because I want to see

1:31:47.877 --> 1:31:49.963
the men who put the money
in that bag.

1:31:50.046 --> 1:31:51.381
And I wanna
look them in the eye,

1:31:51.464 --> 1:31:53.007
and I wanna shake their hand.

1:31:53.091 --> 1:31:56.010
Given that we're partners now,
I can guarantee that

1:31:56.094 --> 1:31:57.429
you will meet
the distinguished gentlemen

1:31:57.512 --> 1:31:59.347
on the Committee
for a Sound Dollar.

1:31:59.431 --> 1:32:01.099
They will be there
to meet you personally,

1:32:01.558 --> 1:32:03.643
although we might need to be
in a private room.

1:32:04.060 --> 1:32:06.312
-Okay.
-- Thank you.

1:32:06.396 --> 1:32:09.190
This is wonderful.
This is the speech.

1:32:09.274 --> 1:32:11.401
- Mr. Maguire,
take that bag.

1:32:11.484 --> 1:32:12.569
- Yes, sir.

1:32:13.111 --> 1:32:15.447
So, you still won't tell me

1:32:16.072 --> 1:32:17.323
who they are.

1:32:17.907 --> 1:32:18.908
Is that true?

1:32:20.285 --> 1:32:21.453
At the event, sir.

1:32:24.956 --> 1:32:26.291
Whoever offers me more money

1:32:26.374 --> 1:32:27.500
-and tells me what to say...

1:32:27.584 --> 1:32:29.002
...and what not to say
in my speech

1:32:29.085 --> 1:32:31.463
very likely killed
Bill Meekins and his daughter.

1:32:32.130 --> 1:32:33.548
And is behind all this.

1:32:34.132 --> 1:32:36.760
- And so,
two soldiers and a nurse

1:32:36.843 --> 1:32:38.428
found ourselves in league

1:32:38.511 --> 1:32:42.182
with the great honorable,
decorated General Dillenbeck.

1:32:42.265 --> 1:32:45.143
General, you should
really speak to Tom Voze,

1:32:45.226 --> 1:32:46.227
Valerie's brother.

1:32:51.316 --> 1:32:53.193
Production Room 7, please.

1:32:53.276 --> 1:32:55.612
Production Room 7,
mechanic needed.

1:32:58.239 --> 1:32:59.240
Never saw that.

1:32:59.741 --> 1:33:01.868
Maybe it's...
Maybe it's modern art.

1:33:02.660 --> 1:33:04.871
Kinda wanna go over there
and take a look at it.

1:33:06.164 --> 1:33:08.291
I would like to try again
in Amsterdam.

1:33:09.626 --> 1:33:10.627
You would?

1:33:11.711 --> 1:33:12.712
Yes.

1:33:13.630 --> 1:33:15.256
Well, let's hope
this goes well.

1:33:16.591 --> 1:33:17.634
- Mr. Voze.

1:33:17.717 --> 1:33:18.968
-Burt.
-- May I call you Tom?

1:33:19.052 --> 1:33:20.678
-Of course.
-- Mrs. Voze.

1:33:20.762 --> 1:33:22.972
Let me introduce you
to General Dillenbeck.

1:33:23.556 --> 1:33:24.557
General.

1:33:25.058 --> 1:33:26.059
General Dillenbeck,

1:33:26.142 --> 1:33:27.852
it is such a pleasure
to meet you.

1:33:27.936 --> 1:33:29.979
I think you are a man
of such honor

1:33:30.063 --> 1:33:31.731
and strength, and such a...

1:33:32.982 --> 1:33:34.275
Such a...

1:33:34.734 --> 1:33:37.737
Truly just so dignified
and wonderful,

1:33:37.821 --> 1:33:40.406
and I truly believe
everything that you say.

1:33:40.490 --> 1:33:41.491
Uh...

1:33:42.617 --> 1:33:43.618
-Libby.

1:33:44.911 --> 1:33:45.912
- Such a...

1:33:45.995 --> 1:33:46.996
Uh, su...

1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:48.081
Such a...

1:33:48.164 --> 1:33:49.916
str... strong...

1:33:51.042 --> 1:33:52.168
She's so excited.

1:33:52.252 --> 1:33:54.963
Very excited.
Inappropriately excited.

1:33:55.839 --> 1:33:58.049
Have you ever broadcast live
on the radio?

1:33:58.132 --> 1:34:00.343
The gala? No, never.

1:34:01.219 --> 1:34:02.637
Well, can you imagine?

1:34:05.139 --> 1:34:06.266
Think of

1:34:06.808 --> 1:34:08.852
your veteran friends
in Cheboygan, Michigan,

1:34:08.935 --> 1:34:10.395
or Carbondale, Illinois,

1:34:10.478 --> 1:34:11.729
sitting at home,

1:34:12.230 --> 1:34:15.400
listening to the radio,
hearing your songs, Burt.

1:34:16.025 --> 1:34:18.611
-Wow.
-And your speech, General.

1:34:20.446 --> 1:34:22.532
The speech Maguire gave me?

1:34:23.157 --> 1:34:26.202
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Your speech.

1:34:27.203 --> 1:34:28.746
The speech you want to give.

1:34:29.956 --> 1:34:31.541
I... I don't know
who Maguire is.

1:34:31.999 --> 1:34:33.543
But I want you
to speak from your heart

1:34:33.626 --> 1:34:35.211
to vindicate Bill Meekins.

1:34:36.462 --> 1:34:37.672
And all those

1:34:38.423 --> 1:34:40.258
voiceless veterans
who've been abandoned.

1:34:40.341 --> 1:34:41.384
Yes.

1:34:41.467 --> 1:34:44.929
- You lead the way.
And the rotten apples,

1:34:45.013 --> 1:34:46.472
whatever they did
to Bill Meekins,

1:34:46.556 --> 1:34:48.391
will reveal themselves.

1:34:49.934 --> 1:34:53.187
I'll give the speech my way.
I wanna tell the truth.

1:34:55.106 --> 1:34:57.108
- The trick was to let
the Committee of Five

1:34:57.191 --> 1:34:58.735
and Maguire think...

1:35:00.737 --> 1:35:02.864
...the general
would give their speech

1:35:03.823 --> 1:35:06.409
for new leadership
in the White House.

1:35:06.492 --> 1:35:08.995
Immediately. No election.

1:35:09.078 --> 1:35:11.873
Conning the veterans
into supporting it.

1:35:13.875 --> 1:35:15.793
And Tom, as promised,

1:35:15.877 --> 1:35:18.880
had gotten us off the hook
with the police

1:35:18.963 --> 1:35:20.924
who now,
to our great surprise,

1:35:21.007 --> 1:35:22.300
were together with us,

1:35:22.383 --> 1:35:24.844
united in this plan
to stop it.

1:35:26.471 --> 1:35:28.473
And we all supported
the general.

1:35:30.183 --> 1:35:32.477
He was using himself as bait.

1:35:42.111 --> 1:35:43.863
Good evening, America.

1:35:43.947 --> 1:35:46.032
This is Wilkin Hartsdale
broadcasting to you

1:35:46.115 --> 1:35:48.910
live from the annual
Veterans Reunion Gala.

1:35:52.080 --> 1:35:53.331
Paul, Henry.

1:35:53.414 --> 1:35:55.750
He's here for you.
He has questions.

1:35:57.627 --> 1:35:59.045
Norcross, Canterbury.

1:36:00.338 --> 1:36:02.256
I've never seen, uh,

1:36:02.340 --> 1:36:05.760
such a big picture
of George Washington.

1:36:05.843 --> 1:36:07.387
Let me ask
a very simple question.

1:36:07.470 --> 1:36:08.763
Whose side are you guys on?

1:36:08.846 --> 1:36:10.348
We're on your side, of course.

1:36:10.431 --> 1:36:13.142
Same God, different church.

1:36:13.226 --> 1:36:16.187
Same lady, different dress.
We're on the exact same side.

1:36:17.522 --> 1:36:18.606
Do me a favor.

1:36:18.690 --> 1:36:20.149
Explain this to me
very carefully

1:36:20.233 --> 1:36:21.359
'cause I'm about
to do something

1:36:21.442 --> 1:36:22.944
that could cost me my life.

1:36:23.027 --> 1:36:24.737
- The trick
with all this is, is to wait

1:36:24.821 --> 1:36:26.572
till the absolute
very last second

1:36:26.656 --> 1:36:29.075
to expose as much
of the criminality

1:36:29.158 --> 1:36:30.243
as we are able to capture.

1:36:30.326 --> 1:36:31.703
-At my expense?
-No, sir,

1:36:31.786 --> 1:36:33.079
-never at your expense.
-No, God. No, no, sir.

1:36:33.162 --> 1:36:34.163
-No, sir.
-- Never at your expense,

1:36:34.247 --> 1:36:35.248
-please.
-There's a lot of people

1:36:35.331 --> 1:36:36.541
I care about here tonight.

1:36:36.624 --> 1:36:38.543
Trust our powers
of discernment, General.

1:36:38.626 --> 1:36:40.545
Yes, the cuckoo
is in the nest,

1:36:40.628 --> 1:36:42.296
and the cuckoo
is about to be trapped.

1:36:44.257 --> 1:36:45.341
Cuckoo?

1:36:47.010 --> 1:36:50.888
And please,
let us have our gala.

1:36:50.972 --> 1:36:52.849
Let us celebrate our lives.

1:36:52.932 --> 1:36:55.435
Get the son of a bitch
who killed Meekins

1:36:55.518 --> 1:36:58.521
and those bastards who wanna
hijack our government.

1:36:58.604 --> 1:36:59.814
Yes?

1:37:02.150 --> 1:37:04.610
I hope this
son-of-a-bitch thing works.

1:37:06.279 --> 1:37:08.364
-Or else we're fucked.
-Hmm.

1:37:08.448 --> 1:37:10.908
- Welcome
to the 14th annual gala

1:37:10.992 --> 1:37:13.536
for the 369th, 42nd,
and the 33rd

1:37:13.619 --> 1:37:15.872
New York regiments.

1:37:59.999 --> 1:38:01.542
- This evening's
entertainment continues

1:38:01.626 --> 1:38:02.627
with Dr. Berendsen,
the medical officer...

1:38:02.710 --> 1:38:03.836
- Peanuts

1:38:03.920 --> 1:38:07.173
-This looks promising.
-- Very promising, Henry.

1:38:07.256 --> 1:38:11.094
- Peanuts

1:38:11.177 --> 1:38:13.721
If you haven't got bananas,
don't be blue

1:38:13.805 --> 1:38:16.557
Peanuts in a little bag
are calling you

1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:19.936
Don't waste them
No tummy ache

1:38:20.019 --> 1:38:22.230
You'll taste them
When you awake

1:38:22.313 --> 1:38:23.731
- Peanuts

1:38:23.815 --> 1:38:25.024
I mean, he is good.

1:38:25.775 --> 1:38:28.861
-He's a little bit flat.
-Well, you do it.

1:38:28.945 --> 1:38:31.405
-- Peanuts

1:38:33.533 --> 1:38:34.951
Yeah, bravo!

1:38:35.034 --> 1:38:37.662
- Thank you,
Wayne Katowski

1:38:38.704 --> 1:38:40.873
-and Victor Barnes!

1:38:40.957 --> 1:38:41.958
Oh, my God!

1:38:47.547 --> 1:38:50.299
Yes, Burt! Whoo!

1:38:50.383 --> 1:38:52.260
Yeah. So, there's
Detective Getweiler.

1:38:52.343 --> 1:38:53.427
- Yeah.

1:38:53.511 --> 1:38:55.638
- Harold.
And Dillenbeck's right there.

1:38:58.182 --> 1:38:59.433
What's your name?

1:38:59.517 --> 1:39:01.561
- Dr. Berendsen says
he believes

1:39:01.644 --> 1:39:02.937
-music is medicine...
-Tony!

1:39:03.020 --> 1:39:05.064
...for each and every one
of these wounded veterans.

1:39:05.148 --> 1:39:06.691
-Fred! Larry!
-Wow!

1:39:07.191 --> 1:39:08.734
-What's your name?
-Alfred, sir.

1:39:08.818 --> 1:39:10.611
Is that the Vandenheuvels?

1:39:10.695 --> 1:39:13.281
- In just a moment,
music will continue.

1:39:13.364 --> 1:39:14.448
Yes.

1:39:14.532 --> 1:39:16.450
That's Dr. Vandenheuvel
and his wife,

1:39:16.534 --> 1:39:17.618
and that's Beatrice
over there too.

1:39:17.702 --> 1:39:18.744
- Coming up later

1:39:18.828 --> 1:39:19.829
-on in the program...
-Oh!

1:39:19.912 --> 1:39:21.497
We're very proud of you.

1:39:21.581 --> 1:39:24.458
- Wow!
What a difference

1:39:24.542 --> 1:39:25.668
a day makes.

1:39:25.751 --> 1:39:28.254
Should I move
my shaving kit back in?

1:39:28.337 --> 1:39:31.465
-That Hebrew sense of humor.
-Father.

1:39:31.549 --> 1:39:33.176
I think it's time
that the medical board

1:39:33.259 --> 1:39:34.886
reassessed
your situation, son.

1:39:34.969 --> 1:39:36.804
I can make that happen.
I'd be happy to.

1:39:36.888 --> 1:39:38.306
Whoa.

1:39:38.389 --> 1:39:39.974
Did you hear that?

1:39:40.057 --> 1:39:41.100
It's a perfect evening!

1:39:41.184 --> 1:39:42.727
This is happening, finally.

1:39:45.271 --> 1:39:46.689
It would mean so much

1:39:46.772 --> 1:39:50.026
if you would introduce us
to General Dillenbeck.

1:39:50.109 --> 1:39:51.319
It means so much to you,

1:39:51.402 --> 1:39:53.279
or it means so much
to your family?

1:39:55.406 --> 1:39:57.241
We're so very proud
of Bertram.

1:39:57.325 --> 1:39:58.951
It's quite the coup
he's been able to pull off.

1:39:59.035 --> 1:40:00.912
-Very proud.
-- Mm.

1:40:00.995 --> 1:40:02.413
Oh, have you met the general?

1:40:02.496 --> 1:40:04.498
He truly is the most wonderful
specimen of a man.

1:40:04.582 --> 1:40:05.583
Clammy, already.

1:40:05.666 --> 1:40:06.792
Truly clammy.

1:40:06.876 --> 1:40:08.544
She never gets
that clammy for me.

1:40:08.628 --> 1:40:09.754
Perhaps I should travel more
on business.

1:40:09.837 --> 1:40:10.838
Oh, Tom.

1:40:12.757 --> 1:40:14.675
I wanna tell you
what a fine veteran he is

1:40:14.759 --> 1:40:16.010
and a wonderful doctor.

1:40:16.093 --> 1:40:17.428
And he deserves love.

1:40:20.181 --> 1:40:21.265
Thank you, sir.

1:40:21.682 --> 1:40:22.725
- Hi, Burt.

1:40:22.808 --> 1:40:23.976
-- Hi.
-Oh, Valerie.

1:40:24.060 --> 1:40:27.021
Please, darling,
could you stop filming people?

1:40:27.104 --> 1:40:29.148
We're documenting
the night, Libby.

1:40:29.232 --> 1:40:31.317
It could be
a historical event, you know.

1:40:31.400 --> 1:40:34.070
Yes, but some people
appreciate their privacy.

1:40:35.404 --> 1:40:36.405
- You don't mind,
do you, General?

1:40:36.489 --> 1:40:37.490
No, no.

1:40:37.573 --> 1:40:39.200
-- Burt?
-We should go see those guys.

1:40:39.283 --> 1:40:41.452
-All right?
-Yes. Yes, we should.

1:40:41.535 --> 1:40:43.454
Valerie and her home movies.

1:40:43.537 --> 1:40:44.830
It's art.

1:40:47.625 --> 1:40:50.044
Beatrice,
will you dance with me?

1:40:51.379 --> 1:40:52.588
- My darling.

1:40:54.882 --> 1:40:57.051
My darling.

1:40:58.219 --> 1:41:01.138
That is Cornelius Vanderbilt.

1:41:02.515 --> 1:41:03.516
Mother?

1:41:03.599 --> 1:41:04.600
MRS.-
Yes, darling.

1:41:04.684 --> 1:41:06.894
Mother,
that is Cornelius Vanderbilt,

1:41:06.978 --> 1:41:09.438
and he's standing
right next to Alice Marble.

1:41:09.522 --> 1:41:11.107
She might win the US Open.

1:41:11.190 --> 1:41:12.316
My parents have to meet them.

1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:14.443
They've wanted to meet
Alice Marble the whole time.

1:41:15.653 --> 1:41:16.904
Can you just wait
for two seconds

1:41:16.988 --> 1:41:18.030
and we'll come back?

1:41:18.114 --> 1:41:20.700
Did you hear what Father said
about you moving in?

1:41:20.783 --> 1:41:23.160
-Isn't that exciting?
-No, thank you.

1:41:24.704 --> 1:41:26.539
What? What do you...
What do you mean?

1:41:26.622 --> 1:41:27.832
No, thank you.

1:41:29.458 --> 1:41:31.460
What does
"No, thank you" mean?

1:41:32.044 --> 1:41:35.840
I've waited too long
for the wrong thing.

1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:40.136
It turned into something
very different

1:41:40.678 --> 1:41:42.513
than it ever once could be.

1:41:45.641 --> 1:41:48.144
I think terrible things
might happen to you.

1:41:49.770 --> 1:41:51.981
What a thing
to say to anyone...

1:41:53.482 --> 1:41:55.109
let alone your beloved.

1:42:01.782 --> 1:42:03.284
- Mother,
there's Cornelius Vanderbilt

1:42:03.367 --> 1:42:05.119
and Alice Marble.
Let's go meet them.

1:42:21.052 --> 1:42:22.094
It's okay, Burt.

1:42:23.262 --> 1:42:24.680
Yeah, you still have us.

1:42:26.015 --> 1:42:28.267
Thank God. I'm running
out of people, fast.

1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:30.936
- Some important men
who, uh,

1:42:31.020 --> 1:42:33.522
I believe you wanted to meet.
Is that right?

1:42:33.606 --> 1:42:34.982
Yeah. Yes, I would like
to meet them.

1:42:35.066 --> 1:42:37.568
Berendsen, we can meet these
people that we talked about.

1:42:37.651 --> 1:42:39.445
Valerie, you looked
so lovely dancing.

1:42:39.528 --> 1:42:41.280
Maybe you should stay here
with your friends.

1:42:41.781 --> 1:42:44.033
There's Tom Voze
talking to the general.

1:42:44.116 --> 1:42:45.409
Oh, yes.

1:42:45.493 --> 1:42:48.329
I spent my whole life
avoiding these people.

1:42:48.412 --> 1:42:49.830
I feel the exact same way,
General.

1:42:49.914 --> 1:42:51.332
These might be
some of the better ones

1:42:51.415 --> 1:42:52.625
worth giving a chance.

1:42:59.423 --> 1:43:00.591
General Dillenbeck,

1:43:01.133 --> 1:43:03.803
this is Mr. Nevins
of Nevins Telecommunications.

1:43:03.886 --> 1:43:05.930
Mr. Belport,
Belport Chemicals,

1:43:06.013 --> 1:43:08.140
Mr. Jeffers
of Jeffers Newschain.

1:43:13.312 --> 1:43:14.980
We wanted to have
Mr. Tomlinson,

1:43:15.064 --> 1:43:16.357
legendary auto inventor,

1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:17.566
but he couldn't
be here tonight.

1:43:17.650 --> 1:43:20.236
He has a fantastic operation
in Munich.

1:43:21.737 --> 1:43:23.531
Gil, may I call you Gil?

1:43:23.614 --> 1:43:25.491
No. You can call me General.

1:43:25.574 --> 1:43:26.951
He prefers General.

1:43:27.034 --> 1:43:29.495
Gil, I understand.
We understand.

1:43:29.578 --> 1:43:31.163
He prefers
to be called General.

1:43:31.247 --> 1:43:32.248
How's it going, Gil?

1:43:32.331 --> 1:43:33.999
I'm Andrew Nevins.
You can call me Andy.

1:43:34.083 --> 1:43:37.253
Well, I'll call you Andy.
You call me General.

1:43:37.336 --> 1:43:39.130
I'm here to reckon
for the death

1:43:39.213 --> 1:43:40.965
of my friend Bill Meekins.

1:43:41.048 --> 1:43:42.091
Oh, who's that?

1:43:42.591 --> 1:43:45.803
Bill Meekins?
We're honoring him tonight.

1:43:46.345 --> 1:43:47.805
Ran the bond exchange.

1:43:47.888 --> 1:43:50.057
Of course, I'm terribly sorry
about what happened.

1:43:50.141 --> 1:43:51.142
I almost forgot.

1:43:51.225 --> 1:43:52.309
MR.-
Tragedy with the daughter.

1:43:52.393 --> 1:43:53.894
MR.- Terrible tragedy.

1:43:53.978 --> 1:43:55.729
I look forward
to speaking with you tonight

1:43:55.813 --> 1:43:58.023
about business opportunities
overseas.

1:43:58.107 --> 1:44:01.318
Our plant in Munich
is getting fantastic returns

1:44:01.402 --> 1:44:03.237
because of strong leadership.

1:44:03.320 --> 1:44:04.905
Knowing how to get things done.

1:44:05.489 --> 1:44:06.907
- Let's have a toast.

1:44:07.950 --> 1:44:10.953
Yes, all right. Good.
We are the three.

1:44:11.036 --> 1:44:13.497
Tom, you could be the fourth,
like we're playing golf.

1:44:13.581 --> 1:44:16.625
And for good luck,
we need a proper fifth.

1:44:16.709 --> 1:44:17.710
General?

1:44:21.213 --> 1:44:22.715
Won't you please step in?

1:44:26.260 --> 1:44:27.261
- To the general.

1:44:27.344 --> 1:44:28.345
MR.- The general.
MR.- To the general.

1:44:28.429 --> 1:44:29.430
MR.- To General.

1:44:34.685 --> 1:44:37.354
- Talk about following
the wrong God home.

1:44:38.355 --> 1:44:40.983
What's more un-American
than a dictatorship

1:44:41.066 --> 1:44:43.319
built by American business?

1:44:43.402 --> 1:44:44.820
- There are two properties,
General,

1:44:44.904 --> 1:44:46.071
if you should
ever want to use them.

1:44:46.155 --> 1:44:47.448
You or your family.

1:44:47.531 --> 1:44:48.824
Pioneer Point in Maryland,

1:44:48.908 --> 1:44:50.659
the home state
of Belport Chemicals.

1:44:50.743 --> 1:44:53.746
A great retreat for you
or the veterans.

1:44:53.829 --> 1:44:55.289
And another one
out in East Hampton.

1:44:55.372 --> 1:44:56.540
You and your family
might like it.

1:44:56.624 --> 1:44:59.126
I'll think about it,
though the wife and I enjoy

1:44:59.210 --> 1:45:01.045
a little place
on the Jersey Shore.

1:45:01.128 --> 1:45:03.756
Maybe you need
a larger imagination, General.

1:45:05.090 --> 1:45:07.218
That's how
we all ended up here.

1:45:08.010 --> 1:45:11.222
Never mind these men, General.
They think they own the world.

1:45:11.305 --> 1:45:13.057
It's time to be getting on
with your speech.

1:45:14.808 --> 1:45:16.644
We're looking forward
to your speech.

1:45:35.120 --> 1:45:38.999
- And now, a featured
star of the 369th, Auggie,

1:45:39.083 --> 1:45:40.417
on the glasses.

1:45:47.091 --> 1:45:48.425
What is that?

1:45:50.427 --> 1:45:53.013
This is one of the finest
innovations from Zurich.

1:45:53.097 --> 1:45:55.641
Removes all pain, all anxiety.

1:45:55.724 --> 1:45:56.725
- Hmm?

1:45:58.727 --> 1:46:01.730
All needless thoughts
that occupy the mind.

1:46:09.446 --> 1:46:10.990
- My back is killing me.

1:46:11.073 --> 1:46:14.618
Now, normally, guys like me,
we have to turn to booze

1:46:14.702 --> 1:46:15.869
and morphine,

1:46:15.953 --> 1:46:17.288
and that can lead
to addiction...

1:46:17.371 --> 1:46:18.831
Oh, that's fast.

1:46:18.914 --> 1:46:20.749
-That is advanced.

1:46:20.833 --> 1:46:22.585
Oh, that is tremendous energy.

1:46:23.711 --> 1:46:25.838
-I feel no pain.
-- It's good, isn't it?

1:46:25.921 --> 1:46:27.089
That is good.

1:46:27.172 --> 1:46:29.383
There's more where
this came from, Burt.

1:46:29.925 --> 1:46:31.343
I wanna know more about this.

1:46:31.427 --> 1:46:33.679
I would love to have
the chemical compound.

1:46:33.762 --> 1:46:36.390
When I get together with my
sisters at the Vril Society,

1:46:36.473 --> 1:46:38.809
we hold a séance
where we let our hair down,

1:46:38.892 --> 1:46:40.644
and it acts
as a kind of antenna.

1:46:40.728 --> 1:46:42.938
It allows us to communicate
with the greater race.

1:46:43.022 --> 1:46:44.898
Honestly, they come
from a different galaxy.

1:46:44.982 --> 1:46:46.525
It's truly fascinating.

1:46:49.486 --> 1:46:51.905
- And now,
the Hinson Brothers.

1:46:53.824 --> 1:46:59.163
Lady of Spain,
I adore you

1:46:59.246 --> 1:47:02.958
Right from the night
I first saw you

1:47:03.042 --> 1:47:04.209
I wanted to say,
for your speech tonight,

1:47:04.293 --> 1:47:05.753
General, some friendly advice.

1:47:05.836 --> 1:47:07.046
- Oh, please,
please, please,

1:47:07.129 --> 1:47:08.505
don't give him
any friendly advice.

1:47:08.589 --> 1:47:10.674
Oh, yeah, well,
what's the friendly advice?

1:47:12.551 --> 1:47:15.429
Tonight, people will be
listening to you on the radio.

1:47:15.512 --> 1:47:16.889
You'll never have
a bigger audience

1:47:16.972 --> 1:47:20.100
with more excited attention
from everyone.

1:47:20.184 --> 1:47:23.062
They'll be looking to you
for inspiration.

1:47:23.729 --> 1:47:26.273
Remember the veterans who have
bled and died on our behalf,

1:47:26.357 --> 1:47:29.318
and remember Bill Meekins

1:47:29.985 --> 1:47:31.945
and honor him respectfully.

1:47:32.029 --> 1:47:34.031
If you improvise
and get lost in the woods

1:47:34.114 --> 1:47:36.075
of some complicated
criminal situation

1:47:36.158 --> 1:47:37.284
over Meekins's death,

1:47:37.368 --> 1:47:38.952
it will reflect badly on you,

1:47:39.036 --> 1:47:41.288
and we don't want that
for you, General.

1:47:42.498 --> 1:47:45.417
The general was very clear
about that he was gonna

1:47:46.210 --> 1:47:48.587
honor Bill Meekins
and tell the truth.

1:47:49.838 --> 1:47:51.465
Well, that's exactly
what I mean.

1:47:51.548 --> 1:47:53.676
Focus on the good qualities
Meekins had.

1:47:53.759 --> 1:47:55.928
His quietness
and his kindness.

1:47:56.011 --> 1:47:58.889
That's what I intend to do
in my own way.

1:48:06.397 --> 1:48:08.315
-What is that?
-- Feel this.

1:48:08.691 --> 1:48:09.942
This is walrus.

1:48:11.151 --> 1:48:12.945
- Oh, that is soft.

1:48:14.405 --> 1:48:15.989
A walrus was killed for this?

1:48:16.073 --> 1:48:20.244
No, sir, he died of old age.
He lived a long, happy life

1:48:20.327 --> 1:48:22.496
because he made smart choices.

1:48:24.415 --> 1:48:26.333
It's a contribution
for your foundation.

1:48:27.376 --> 1:48:28.961
I don't have a foundation.

1:48:29.420 --> 1:48:31.630
- Well, maybe you should
start one. I can help you.

1:48:31.714 --> 1:48:33.966
$36,000, General.

1:48:34.049 --> 1:48:35.384
Think of everything you can do

1:48:35.467 --> 1:48:37.553
with Dr. Berendsen
and his medical innovations.

1:48:37.636 --> 1:48:39.054
- So much
to be accomplished.

1:48:39.138 --> 1:48:40.806
You have to take the money.

1:48:40.889 --> 1:48:42.516
What do you mean,
I have to take it?

1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:46.437
Listen to me. Someone, not me,

1:48:46.520 --> 1:48:49.857
they will take your face
and your name,

1:48:49.940 --> 1:48:51.400
put it in the New York Times,

1:48:51.483 --> 1:48:53.485
and wipe
their dog's ass with it.

1:48:54.862 --> 1:48:57.781
Think of everything you've
accomplished in your life.

1:48:57.865 --> 1:48:59.992
It'll be forgotten, erased.

1:49:01.201 --> 1:49:03.036
You'll be treated
like an old kook

1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:05.247
and buried by history.

1:49:05.330 --> 1:49:09.918
That's what they can do.
Make the right speech.

1:49:10.753 --> 1:49:12.629
Or they'll turn you
into a martyr

1:49:12.713 --> 1:49:14.548
and say an anarchist did it.

1:49:15.591 --> 1:49:17.801
Don't make the mistake
like Bill Meekins.

1:49:17.885 --> 1:49:20.345
That was a tragic theft
of a life.

1:49:20.429 --> 1:49:23.223
Lady of Spain, I love you

1:49:26.310 --> 1:49:28.187
- That was
the Hinson Brothers.

1:49:29.146 --> 1:49:30.731
The Hinson Brothers,
they were great.

1:49:30.814 --> 1:49:32.316
Don't you agree? Yes.

1:49:32.399 --> 1:49:35.611
Hinson Brothers.
Doing, uh, Lady of Spain.

1:49:35.694 --> 1:49:38.864
Yeah, Lady of Spain.
I met a lady of Spain once

1:49:38.947 --> 1:49:40.908
and she turned me into
a gentleman of pain.

1:49:40.991 --> 1:49:42.326
-Yes.

1:49:42.409 --> 1:49:45.412
Now, the gentleman I'm about
to bring out right now

1:49:45.496 --> 1:49:47.623
is a doctor of our regiment

1:49:47.706 --> 1:49:50.834
and a man
I like to call "friend."

1:49:50.918 --> 1:49:53.128
Please welcome Burt Berendsen.

1:49:53.212 --> 1:49:54.963
-Come on, Burt.

1:49:55.047 --> 1:49:58.383
Time to give your speech,
Burt. Burt?

1:49:59.259 --> 1:50:01.220
Dr. Burt Berendsen.

1:50:06.099 --> 1:50:09.603
My name is Burt Berendsen.
Most of you know me.

1:50:09.686 --> 1:50:13.816
I am the son of a mechanic
from Elmira.

1:50:14.274 --> 1:50:15.859
As a child,

1:50:16.902 --> 1:50:20.280
we love the world, naturally.

1:50:21.448 --> 1:50:24.868
And we hope
the world loves us.

1:50:26.620 --> 1:50:29.706
As my friend Harold said
sometimes

1:50:29.790 --> 1:50:32.876
I might have followed
the wrong God home.

1:50:33.418 --> 1:50:34.920
Well, not this man.

1:50:36.505 --> 1:50:39.883
He always followed
the right God home.

1:50:45.889 --> 1:50:47.975
Dillenbeck! Dillenbeck!

1:50:48.058 --> 1:50:49.476
Dillenbeck! Dillenbeck!

1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:50.686
- Dillenbeck!

1:50:50.769 --> 1:50:53.564
- Dillenbeck!
Dillenbeck! Dillenbeck!

1:50:54.731 --> 1:50:56.733
Drecksgesicht! Drecksgesicht!

1:50:56.817 --> 1:50:59.069
Drecksgesicht! Drecksgesicht!

1:51:04.283 --> 1:51:06.869
Listen to those Bund bastards.

1:51:07.452 --> 1:51:10.080
Shower of bleeders, rotters.

1:51:11.206 --> 1:51:14.626
If you people shouting at me
in German had any courage,

1:51:14.710 --> 1:51:16.169
you would behave with dignity.

1:51:22.885 --> 1:51:24.803
- Yes! General Dillenbeck!

1:51:27.806 --> 1:51:31.310
I fought in five wars
on three continents.

1:51:31.393 --> 1:51:34.146
People shot at me
my whole life. My whole life.

1:51:34.229 --> 1:51:36.607
I know fear,
and I know facing fear.

1:51:36.690 --> 1:51:38.442
But the one thing
I truly detest,

1:51:39.067 --> 1:51:42.529
the one thing I truly,
truly detest,

1:51:43.488 --> 1:51:44.698
is cruelty.

1:51:46.575 --> 1:51:47.826
I've been offered money

1:51:47.910 --> 1:51:50.203
to become
the self-appointed leader

1:51:51.705 --> 1:51:53.832
of the veterans,
veterans like you,

1:51:55.083 --> 1:51:58.545
to be put in the White House
without an election

1:51:59.463 --> 1:52:02.841
as some sort of advisor
by popular demand

1:52:03.425 --> 1:52:04.635
of you.

1:52:05.719 --> 1:52:09.348
These same people
want me to emulate

1:52:09.431 --> 1:52:12.225
a certain European leader
named Mussolini.

1:52:15.145 --> 1:52:17.189
They think
he's the type of leader

1:52:17.272 --> 1:52:18.857
that this country needs.

1:52:19.566 --> 1:52:20.901
The type of leader

1:52:21.485 --> 1:52:25.614
who ran over a child
and never stopped his car.

1:52:27.866 --> 1:52:31.078
The type of leader
whose excuse was,

1:52:31.161 --> 1:52:34.081
"What's one person
in the affairs of the state?"

1:52:36.792 --> 1:52:39.878
General Bill Meekins
was in that car.

1:52:40.545 --> 1:52:42.089
He was a friend of mine.

1:52:42.172 --> 1:52:43.590
He was a good person.

1:52:44.466 --> 1:52:46.218
But when he told that story,

1:52:46.927 --> 1:52:49.846
when he intended to tell it
again here on this stage,

1:52:50.472 --> 1:52:51.848
he became another person

1:52:51.932 --> 1:52:54.142
whose life was worth nothing

1:52:55.018 --> 1:52:56.895
in the affairs of the state.

1:52:57.646 --> 1:52:59.731
-He was murdered.

1:52:59.815 --> 1:53:02.109
Yes, he was murdered
and dishonored,

1:53:02.943 --> 1:53:04.820
as I might be murdered
or dishonored

1:53:04.903 --> 1:53:07.114
for telling that story
here tonight.

1:53:09.241 --> 1:53:11.618
What kind of country does this
become when that happens?

1:53:13.370 --> 1:53:15.998
I became a Marine
to serve the Constitution,

1:53:16.081 --> 1:53:18.250
which intends
for us all to be equal

1:53:18.333 --> 1:53:19.918
in the brotherhood of mankind.

1:53:20.002 --> 1:53:23.755
But what good is it
when powerful people

1:53:23.839 --> 1:53:27.134
make exceptions for the people
who stand in their way?

1:53:27.968 --> 1:53:30.012
Some people of influence
and power

1:53:30.095 --> 1:53:32.597
like it when regular folks
are fired up by hatred

1:53:32.681 --> 1:53:36.184
because it distracts us from
the fairness and kindness.

1:53:36.810 --> 1:53:38.937
They don't want us
to think about too much

1:53:39.021 --> 1:53:40.605
just so they can get
more and more

1:53:40.689 --> 1:53:42.232
of what they already have,

1:53:42.315 --> 1:53:44.109
which is vast wealth.

1:53:44.901 --> 1:53:46.445
This is your country.

1:53:46.528 --> 1:53:48.739
This is your country.

1:53:50.699 --> 1:53:52.909
Don't let the big men
take it away from you.

1:53:56.371 --> 1:53:59.166
Dillenbeck! Dillenbeck!

1:53:59.249 --> 1:54:01.752
Dillenbeck! Dillenbeck!

1:54:01.835 --> 1:54:03.420
Look, it's that guy.

1:54:03.503 --> 1:54:05.172
I'm the son of a banker.

1:54:05.255 --> 1:54:07.799
-I'm a Republican.

1:54:07.883 --> 1:54:10.510
-Where's Paul and Henry?
-Not here.

1:54:10.594 --> 1:54:11.595
I'm a conservative.

1:54:11.678 --> 1:54:13.013
What about the detectives?
Do you know where they are?

1:54:13.096 --> 1:54:14.306
Also not here.

1:54:14.389 --> 1:54:16.016
That's what it's like

1:54:16.099 --> 1:54:17.309
when people who have money

1:54:17.392 --> 1:54:19.895
only think about
wanting much more of it.

1:54:20.771 --> 1:54:22.272
That's all that
they think about.

1:54:22.981 --> 1:54:26.568
And they forget that you
are the ones who went out

1:54:26.651 --> 1:54:28.987
and protected them.

1:54:30.197 --> 1:54:31.656
You lost an eye

1:54:31.740 --> 1:54:33.492
or you lost your life,

1:54:33.575 --> 1:54:35.994
and your family had to suffer,

1:54:36.078 --> 1:54:37.662
though they

1:54:37.746 --> 1:54:39.372
were the heroes
who sent you off to war.

1:54:42.167 --> 1:54:44.044
Whoever's shooting at me
is a coward.

1:54:44.419 --> 1:54:46.254
I've been shot at
all over the world.

1:54:46.338 --> 1:54:47.547
- Get his gun!

1:54:49.216 --> 1:54:51.384
I am not intimidated.
I am not afraid.

1:54:52.761 --> 1:54:55.305
-You all right?
-Burt, are you all right?

1:54:55.388 --> 1:54:56.515
Lem, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1:55:07.400 --> 1:55:08.944
- Sic semper tyrannis!

1:55:09.027 --> 1:55:10.779
Dillenbeck's a traitor!

1:55:10.862 --> 1:55:13.115
-Stop that man.
-- Tom Voze is a great man!

1:55:13.198 --> 1:55:15.492
Tom Voze is a great man!
You have...

1:55:19.204 --> 1:55:20.205
Keep that man down.

1:55:20.288 --> 1:55:22.541
Sinful and legal.
Ask Mr. Voze!

1:55:27.212 --> 1:55:29.464
My country
'Tis of thee

1:55:29.548 --> 1:55:32.175
-Sweet land of liberty

1:55:32.259 --> 1:55:33.468
Of thee I sing

1:55:33.552 --> 1:55:35.262
- Polizei. Polizei.

1:55:35.470 --> 1:55:37.597
Break it up! Break it up!
Come here.

1:55:41.643 --> 1:55:44.146
I'm a veteran and a patriot,
you fool.

1:55:44.229 --> 1:55:46.398
You killed Liz Meekins,
you son of a bitch.

1:55:47.232 --> 1:55:49.526
And for all I know,
her father too.

1:55:50.193 --> 1:55:52.237
United States Treasury!
Everyone, leave!

1:55:53.446 --> 1:55:55.615
-Are you okay?
-- This is terrible.

1:55:55.699 --> 1:55:57.534
We never meant for
anything like this to happen.

1:55:57.617 --> 1:55:58.910
This is an outrage.

1:55:58.994 --> 1:56:00.036
You're gonna be charged.

1:56:00.120 --> 1:56:01.454
You're gonna be charged, Tom.

1:56:01.538 --> 1:56:02.539
You. Yes, you.

1:56:02.622 --> 1:56:03.623
- No, sir.
You are confused.

1:56:03.707 --> 1:56:04.708
No, I'm not confused.

1:56:04.791 --> 1:56:06.001
- Between my own pill

1:56:06.084 --> 1:56:07.586
and getting shot,

1:56:07.669 --> 1:56:10.505
these eye drops are
the only reason I'm standing

1:56:10.589 --> 1:56:12.299
and I feel no pain.

1:56:13.049 --> 1:56:17.470
And holy shit! Look what's
happening in this room.

1:56:17.554 --> 1:56:18.555
Everything.

1:56:18.638 --> 1:56:19.890
- ...gun from
the Committee of the Five.

1:56:19.973 --> 1:56:22.684
He called you by your name,
Tom, with pride.

1:56:22.767 --> 1:56:24.019
I don't know that man.

1:56:24.102 --> 1:56:25.687
We just fought that man
for our lives.

1:56:25.770 --> 1:56:27.063
- Burt and I saw him
push Liz Meekins.

1:56:27.147 --> 1:56:28.148
He's the killer.

1:56:28.940 --> 1:56:30.400
- There is
enough evidence.

1:56:30.483 --> 1:56:31.484
I am sorry to say

1:56:31.568 --> 1:56:33.403
that the man who took a shot
at General Dillenbeck

1:56:33.486 --> 1:56:34.738
on that stage tonight

1:56:34.821 --> 1:56:37.199
was the same man
on the boat with Meekins,

1:56:37.282 --> 1:56:40.452
on a ticket purchased
by your foundation.

1:56:40.535 --> 1:56:41.620
- There is no need
to raise your voice.

1:56:41.703 --> 1:56:43.330
- Yours, Mr. Voze.

1:56:43.413 --> 1:56:44.456
- Tom,
what's happening?

1:56:44.539 --> 1:56:45.540
- What are the charges?

1:56:45.624 --> 1:56:46.708
- The charges
are against you

1:56:46.791 --> 1:56:47.792
and the guests you invited.

1:56:47.876 --> 1:56:49.878
-The Committee of the Five.
-- For what?

1:56:49.961 --> 1:56:51.087
Committee of the Five.

1:56:51.171 --> 1:56:53.173
Conspiracy to bribe
a United States general.

1:56:53.256 --> 1:56:55.550
Attempted assassination.

1:56:55.634 --> 1:56:57.844
Conspiracy to overthrow
the US government.

1:56:57.928 --> 1:57:00.639
Trading with dictators,
Italy, Germany.

1:57:00.722 --> 1:57:03.141
Two murders your foundation
apparently seems to be

1:57:03.225 --> 1:57:06.228
responsible for,
Meekins and his daughter.

1:57:06.311 --> 1:57:07.812
Tom, did you do this?

1:57:07.896 --> 1:57:09.981
I felt it was wrong
that Meekins died.

1:57:10.065 --> 1:57:11.816
That was a tragic theft
of a life.

1:57:12.525 --> 1:57:14.402
But something had to be done

1:57:14.486 --> 1:57:15.862
because he didn't see

1:57:15.946 --> 1:57:18.281
the opportunity
of the new ways to live.

1:57:18.365 --> 1:57:20.492
He didn't understand.
Meekins didn't understand.

1:57:20.575 --> 1:57:21.701
Do you understand that?

1:57:21.785 --> 1:57:23.245
All right.
You need to slow it down.

1:57:23.745 --> 1:57:25.747
Tom, please tell me
you didn't have anything to do

1:57:25.830 --> 1:57:27.040
with my medication.

1:57:27.123 --> 1:57:29.751
Tom influenced your doctor,
Valerie,

1:57:29.834 --> 1:57:31.753
as he had done
with your mother before.

1:57:35.882 --> 1:57:37.759
-Is that true?
-A little.

1:57:38.385 --> 1:57:39.469
A little?

1:57:40.345 --> 1:57:41.680
I did it for your own good.

1:57:41.763 --> 1:57:42.847
You poisoned me?

1:57:42.931 --> 1:57:44.641
If that's what
you want to call it,

1:57:44.724 --> 1:57:45.809
fine.

1:57:46.434 --> 1:57:49.729
I was looking after you,
your best interests.

1:57:50.272 --> 1:57:52.607
You're reckless, like a child.

1:57:53.358 --> 1:57:56.444
Listen to me. You're running
around all over Europe

1:57:57.070 --> 1:57:59.030
and saying bad things
about the war?

1:58:00.115 --> 1:58:01.908
Consorting with a Black man.

1:58:03.201 --> 1:58:06.955
- Consorting with a man,
a free man,

1:58:07.038 --> 1:58:10.250
in Amsterdam,
that fought for you!

1:58:10.834 --> 1:58:12.419
Like the clinics, Tom?

1:58:13.128 --> 1:58:14.254
- What clinics?

1:58:14.337 --> 1:58:15.922
Committee of the Five.

1:58:16.006 --> 1:58:17.882
You know what clinics
I'm talking about, Tom.

1:58:17.966 --> 1:58:19.718
- Forced sterilization.

1:58:19.801 --> 1:58:20.969
We'll see about that.

1:58:21.052 --> 1:58:23.221
We saw the Committee
of the Five symbol

1:58:23.305 --> 1:58:25.181
-there.
-Stop lying!

1:58:25.640 --> 1:58:27.976
- That Tom had an angle
was no surprise,

1:58:28.059 --> 1:58:29.102
but the horror of it...

1:58:29.769 --> 1:58:32.397
My God.
Right under Valerie's nose.

1:58:32.480 --> 1:58:35.483
They kept her distracted
with the invented condition.

1:58:36.359 --> 1:58:38.611
Goering,
Hitler's right-hand man,

1:58:39.154 --> 1:58:41.656
-and Hitler himself.

1:58:41.740 --> 1:58:43.992
Most people didn't even know
who he was yet.

1:58:45.327 --> 1:58:47.245
Tom even paid Goering
to write a column

1:58:47.329 --> 1:58:48.705
in the Jeffers papers

1:58:48.788 --> 1:58:50.332
about the new
Aryan government.

1:58:50.415 --> 1:58:52.208
-Whatever that was.

1:58:54.919 --> 1:58:58.173
Tom had just finished
the topiary with the symbol.

1:58:58.256 --> 1:59:00.925
You couldn't see it
except from above.

1:59:01.968 --> 1:59:05.096
I mean, you gotta be some
kind of super-fanatic believer

1:59:05.180 --> 1:59:06.890
to make your bushes like that.

1:59:06.973 --> 1:59:08.391
Don't you look at me
like that, Libby.

1:59:08.475 --> 1:59:09.476
Valerie, darling.

1:59:09.559 --> 1:59:11.895
All great societies
are built this way.

1:59:12.520 --> 1:59:14.689
You live in a dream world
with your strange sculptures.

1:59:14.773 --> 1:59:16.358
And that's fine.
You can have that.

1:59:16.441 --> 1:59:18.026
But it won't make
the world go round.

1:59:18.109 --> 1:59:20.111
I'm very happy
to be unimportant

1:59:20.195 --> 1:59:22.697
and live in a place
that has love and beauty.

1:59:22.781 --> 1:59:24.616
Art and love,

1:59:24.699 --> 1:59:26.993
that's what makes the life
worth living,

1:59:27.744 --> 1:59:29.371
while you're building
this big,

1:59:29.454 --> 1:59:31.748
gigantic, terrifying future.

1:59:32.499 --> 1:59:34.542
What a waste
of your imagination.

1:59:34.626 --> 1:59:37.087
I made plenty, for us,

1:59:37.170 --> 1:59:38.630
rebuilding Germany.

1:59:39.297 --> 1:59:40.382
I wanted to stand with

1:59:40.465 --> 1:59:42.050
the strongest leaders
in the world.

1:59:42.717 --> 1:59:44.761
But I'm also happy
to go to war against them.

1:59:45.303 --> 1:59:48.598
- Another war?
But we just did all that.

1:59:49.891 --> 1:59:51.393
You mean to tell me

1:59:51.476 --> 1:59:54.229
these rich guys
will support dictators

1:59:54.312 --> 1:59:55.980
or fight them?

1:59:56.064 --> 1:59:58.691
They believe in nothing
but making money.

1:59:59.234 --> 2:00:01.027
And that's why
Meekins was killed,

2:00:01.111 --> 2:00:04.447
because he wouldn't go along
with that or support it?

2:00:04.531 --> 2:00:05.824
Insanity!

2:00:06.491 --> 2:00:08.743
And we have
walked right into it.

2:00:08.827 --> 2:00:10.578
No. Oh, no, no, no.

2:00:11.162 --> 2:00:13.289
- Ah...
- Tom quickly saw us

2:00:13.373 --> 2:00:15.208
as his best chance
to get the general.

2:00:15.792 --> 2:00:17.627
If you got someone
like Gil Dillenbeck

2:00:17.710 --> 2:00:18.920
involved with your event,

2:00:19.003 --> 2:00:20.422
it would help me
to get involved.

2:00:20.505 --> 2:00:21.798
So, you need someone?
You always...

2:00:21.881 --> 2:00:23.341
-He always needs someone...
-Valerie,

2:00:23.425 --> 2:00:25.385
-would you give it a rest?
-...in front of him.

2:00:25.760 --> 2:00:28.513
You thought you'd use
these men to get me.

2:00:28.596 --> 2:00:31.057
But I used them
and their event

2:00:31.141 --> 2:00:32.142
to reveal you

2:00:32.225 --> 2:00:34.602
and stop your plan
for at least a decade.

2:00:34.686 --> 2:00:37.230
Maybe two or three more,
hopefully.

2:00:38.314 --> 2:00:40.650
- We did stop the plot.

2:00:41.776 --> 2:00:42.861
This is true.

2:00:45.113 --> 2:00:47.365
The Committee of the Five

2:00:47.449 --> 2:00:49.117
didn't get
their American dictator.

2:00:49.200 --> 2:00:51.536
I appeared before
the congressional committee,

2:00:51.619 --> 2:00:54.247
the highest representation
of the American people,

2:00:54.330 --> 2:00:56.040
under subpoena
to tell what I knew of...

2:00:56.124 --> 2:00:58.293
- The general
testified to Congress,

2:00:58.376 --> 2:01:01.087
and they agreed he was right.

2:01:01.838 --> 2:01:04.757
What do powerful people want?

2:01:04.841 --> 2:01:06.509
Is it never enough?

2:01:06.593 --> 2:01:08.845
They do the craziest things.

2:01:15.518 --> 2:01:17.353
Oh, my God!
What's the matter with you?

2:01:17.437 --> 2:01:18.438
- What the hell
did you do?

2:01:18.521 --> 2:01:19.939
Oh, my God!
Valerie, what have you done?

2:01:20.023 --> 2:01:21.649
What's the matter with you?
What did you do?

2:01:21.733 --> 2:01:24.235
We had everything
we needed to prosecute,

2:01:24.319 --> 2:01:25.820
and now
it's all out the window!

2:01:25.904 --> 2:01:27.322
- It's a huge problem now.

2:01:27.405 --> 2:01:28.448
Yes, well done.

2:01:28.531 --> 2:01:33.328
Tom, my face.
She ruined my face!

2:01:33.411 --> 2:01:36.289
I couldn't help it.
They're so awful.

2:01:36.372 --> 2:01:37.874
- Woman,
have you lost your mind?

2:01:37.957 --> 2:01:39.375
- I told you
she was trouble.

2:01:39.459 --> 2:01:40.793
- Yeah, that was
rather stupid, Valerie.

2:01:40.877 --> 2:01:41.920
- You could go to jail,
Valerie.

2:01:42.003 --> 2:01:43.630
Tell them the truth, Harold.

2:01:47.091 --> 2:01:49.219
Are you all right, Valerie?
You're shaking.

2:01:51.387 --> 2:01:53.264
Oh, I'm fine.
I was just thinking about

2:01:53.348 --> 2:01:54.724
shooting Tom and Libby
in the face.

2:01:54.807 --> 2:01:57.477
-- Hmm.
-I won't do it. Don't worry.

2:01:57.560 --> 2:01:59.062
Well, that's a good decision.
Thank God.

2:01:59.145 --> 2:02:01.356
Yes, it would've bollocksed
everything. We'd have no case.

2:02:01.439 --> 2:02:04.567
- You have to stand up
to them, as we had done.

2:02:04.651 --> 2:02:07.195
And you have to live
your truth.

2:02:09.572 --> 2:02:10.573
I love Harold.

2:02:11.241 --> 2:02:13.826
He's given me the greatest
happiness of my life,

2:02:13.910 --> 2:02:15.245
as has Burt.

2:02:27.257 --> 2:02:29.509
- There it is.
Look at that.

2:02:30.176 --> 2:02:32.470
That's how you face
such a world.

2:02:33.555 --> 2:02:37.016
You must have love
in your heart for your life.

2:02:38.059 --> 2:02:40.979
It is love versus hate.

2:02:41.646 --> 2:02:44.440
I love my life
and the people in it.

2:02:45.942 --> 2:02:47.151
Even Beatrice.

2:02:47.819 --> 2:02:51.072
And clear, not Portuguese,
I'm-in-love-with-her Irma.

2:02:51.155 --> 2:02:52.490
Milton.

2:02:52.574 --> 2:02:55.118
Shirley at the office
with Morty.

2:02:55.952 --> 2:02:58.413
The tapestry.
Everything in it.

2:02:59.205 --> 2:03:01.040
Even my glass eye.

2:03:01.124 --> 2:03:02.250
Dillenbeck's dog

2:03:02.333 --> 2:03:04.377
and the bouillabaisse
we didn't get to have.

2:03:05.587 --> 2:03:07.755
Each one of us
is given a tapestry,

2:03:08.256 --> 2:03:09.382
our own opera.

2:03:09.465 --> 2:03:11.301
This person and this person.

2:03:11.384 --> 2:03:12.802
Thinking about it.

2:03:14.304 --> 2:03:15.930
Love is not enough.

2:03:16.014 --> 2:03:18.308
You got to fight
to protect kindness.

2:03:19.225 --> 2:03:21.853
You get attached
to people and things.

2:03:23.021 --> 2:03:25.315
And they might
just break your heart.

2:03:25.398 --> 2:03:26.941
But that's being alive.

2:03:28.776 --> 2:03:30.737
My back brace
that I so disliked

2:03:30.820 --> 2:03:32.572
had saved me from this bullet.

2:03:32.655 --> 2:03:34.115
You lucky bastard.

2:03:34.198 --> 2:03:35.491
- And we three

2:03:35.575 --> 2:03:36.993
had helped stop
this terrible plot.

2:03:37.076 --> 2:03:38.328
I can't believe that.

2:03:38.411 --> 2:03:41.205
- Burt Berendsen,
Harold Woodman,

2:03:41.289 --> 2:03:42.790
and Valerie Voze.

2:03:43.374 --> 2:03:45.043
Jerks, Nevins...

2:03:45.126 --> 2:03:47.754
- Tom would not
stay arrested long.

2:03:47.837 --> 2:03:49.505
Those people never do.

2:03:49.589 --> 2:03:51.591
Talk to my lawyer. You'll see.

2:03:52.383 --> 2:03:55.845
- Committee of the Five
never faced any charges.

2:03:56.512 --> 2:03:59.349
They disappeared,
as they can do.

2:04:00.058 --> 2:04:02.435
Tom and his friends
smeared the general.

2:04:04.020 --> 2:04:07.857
It was a warning
of what they were capable of.

2:04:09.984 --> 2:04:13.446
Maguire died mysteriously
at the age of 37.

2:04:13.988 --> 2:04:15.573
He knew too much.

2:04:16.574 --> 2:04:17.742
Valerie and Harold

2:04:17.825 --> 2:04:19.911
were no longer safe
in this country.

2:04:23.414 --> 2:04:25.583
Friends for life
means friends for life.

2:04:26.918 --> 2:04:28.461
You do whatever it takes.

2:04:28.544 --> 2:04:30.922
We had to get them on a boat
that very night.

2:04:37.512 --> 2:04:38.846
Woodman, you should...

2:04:38.930 --> 2:04:40.181
- Thank you, Henry.

2:04:40.264 --> 2:04:41.974
I'm way ahead of you.
I made my decision.

2:04:42.433 --> 2:04:43.935
Harold's coming with me.

2:04:44.018 --> 2:04:45.561
No, you're coming with me.

2:04:45.645 --> 2:04:47.438
No, you're coming with me.

2:04:49.232 --> 2:04:50.983
- You'll be seeing
me again, Dr. Berendsen,

2:04:51.067 --> 2:04:53.861
because history
repeats itself.

2:04:53.945 --> 2:04:56.489
Goodbye, old friend.
We'll see you in Amsterdam.

2:04:57.115 --> 2:04:59.242
- Oh, no.
You're not going to Amsterdam.

2:04:59.325 --> 2:05:00.326
- What?

2:05:00.410 --> 2:05:01.661
It's only a matter of time

2:05:01.744 --> 2:05:03.788
before the Gestapo
kicks down your door.

2:05:03.871 --> 2:05:04.872
- Mm.

2:05:04.956 --> 2:05:06.332
What's the Gestapo?

2:05:06.416 --> 2:05:08.376
-- Oh.
-Yeah, you don't wanna know.

2:05:09.127 --> 2:05:11.546
We'll, uh,
send you somewhere safer.

2:05:11.629 --> 2:05:13.881
Beautiful weather
this time of year.

2:05:13.965 --> 2:05:16.342
And the blue-headed
vireo migration to boot.

2:05:16.426 --> 2:05:18.219
Yes.
It's spectacular bird country.

2:05:18.302 --> 2:05:19.429
-Isn't it, though?
-Really.

2:05:19.512 --> 2:05:21.514
-Yeah.
-I'm jealous.

2:05:21.597 --> 2:05:22.598
- Burt.

2:05:23.641 --> 2:05:25.268
Burt, why don't you
come with us?

2:05:27.103 --> 2:05:28.271
I choose to stay.

2:05:28.813 --> 2:05:31.315
Who knows?
Maybe I'll find a new life

2:05:31.399 --> 2:05:33.776
-and a new love.
-- I hope so.

2:05:34.902 --> 2:05:35.987
Because when it comes to love,

2:05:36.070 --> 2:05:38.239
there's nothing
quite so good as clarity.

2:05:38.948 --> 2:05:39.949
I agree.

2:05:41.451 --> 2:05:43.411
- I stayed to stand up
for my country

2:05:43.494 --> 2:05:44.495
so that one day,

2:05:44.579 --> 2:05:47.290
my best friends
could come back.

2:05:51.002 --> 2:05:52.128
- Goodbye, Burt.

2:05:56.883 --> 2:05:58.509
- Au revoir,
my good friend.

2:06:01.804 --> 2:06:03.514
- Be happy, Burt!

2:06:05.391 --> 2:06:08.019
-Henry. Paul. General.
-Thank you.

2:06:08.102 --> 2:06:09.854
-Farewell for now.
-- Milton.

2:06:10.897 --> 2:06:12.774
- Part of me wished
I did run with my friends.

2:06:17.862 --> 2:06:19.280
But I didn't.

2:06:21.073 --> 2:06:24.160
You want for your heart
and for your people

2:06:24.744 --> 2:06:27.872
to follow the right God home.

2:06:55.066 --> 2:06:56.317
Amsterdam.

2:06:57.109 --> 2:06:58.528
Amsterdam.

2:07:07.370 --> 2:07:10.039
I appeared before
the congressional committee,

2:07:10.122 --> 2:07:12.792
the highest representation
of the American people,

2:07:12.875 --> 2:07:15.461
under subpoena to tell
what I knew of activities,

2:07:15.545 --> 2:07:17.588
which I believe
might lead to an attempt...

2:07:17.672 --> 2:07:20.174
- ...to set up
a fascist dictatorship.

2:07:20.258 --> 2:07:21.551
The plan as outlined to me

2:07:21.634 --> 2:07:23.719
was to form
an organization of veterans,

2:07:23.803 --> 2:07:25.721
to use as a bluff
or as a club,

2:07:25.805 --> 2:07:27.765
at least to intimidate
the government

2:07:27.849 --> 2:07:30.226
and break down
our democratic institutions.
