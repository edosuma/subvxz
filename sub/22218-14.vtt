- Well, thank you.
<i>- Man, it's the final five,</i>

09:20.393 --> 09:22.812
{\an8}and you're doing
three little objects

09:22.895 --> 09:23.854
{\an8}in the middle with a bunch
of weird flames around it?

09:23.938 --> 09:26.315
<i>Dude, if I'd have known</i>
<i>it was that easy,</i>

09:26.399 --> 09:27.316
<i>I would have done a little star</i>
<i>and then a big circle.</i>

09:27.400 --> 09:29.902
- Craig, you did
a sacred heart here.

09:29.986 --> 09:30.945
- Yes, sir.
<i>- In terms of precision,</i>

09:31.028 --> 09:32.613
<i>you definitely</i>
<i>did measure this thing out</i>

09:32.697 --> 09:34.824
before you even got the nails
in your hands.

09:34.907 --> 09:38.869
<i>It does have a little bit</i>
<i>of an unfinished feel to it.</i>

09:38.953 --> 09:41.580
- Making progress with
this thing is definitely slow.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.624
<i>- The fact that there's so much</i>
<i>of your sketch visible</i>

09:43.708 --> 09:45.084
<i>lends me to believe</i>
<i>that you should have</i>

09:45.167 --> 09:46.544
<i>either sketched lighter</i>

09:46.627 --> 09:49.422
<i>or just made</i>
<i>some reference marks.</i>

09:49.505 --> 09:50.089
<i>I think that's one of</i>
<i>the things that makes it seem</i>

09:50.172 --> 09:52.717
largely unfinished to me.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.136
- If I had more time I would
start filling in areas, but--

09:55.219 --> 09:56.721
- I just don't feel
like there's enough use

09:56.804 --> 09:58.347
<i>of different size nails</i>

09:58.431 --> 10:00.016
<i>to give it a lot</i>
<i>of different dimensions.</i>

10:00.099 --> 10:01.559
<i>- It just looks</i>
<i>like you could work on this</i>

10:01.642 --> 10:03.519
for another 14 days.

10:03.602 --> 10:05.688
- Chris.
- The areas that you were able

10:05.771 --> 10:08.482
<i>to really get</i>
<i>enough nail concentration in</i>

10:08.566 --> 10:10.151
<i>really gives it</i>
<i>a stronger feel.</i>

10:10.234 --> 10:11.110
<i>- Judging from precision,</i>

10:11.193 --> 10:13.612
<i>you have a lot</i>
<i>of symmetrical shapes.</i>

10:13.696 --> 10:15.865
<i>You got some precise lines</i>
<i>in the shape of the cross.</i>

10:15.948 --> 10:18.034
<i>You really gridded out</i>
<i>the outline,</i>

10:18.117 --> 10:20.453
but as with Craig's, yours also
does have an unfinished feel.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.872
<i>For what you're trying</i>
<i>to achieve here,</i>

10:22.955 --> 10:24.749
<i>especially with the rays</i>
<i>at the bottom</i>

10:24.832 --> 10:26.709
<i>and the wings at the top,</i>
<i>I just feel like you'd need</i>

10:26.792 --> 10:30.546
a lot more time
and a lot more nails.

10:30.629 --> 10:32.381
- Kruseman, is this
a particular type of bug?

10:32.465 --> 10:35.051
<i>- It's actually a Tibetan bat.</i>

10:35.134 --> 10:36.719
<i>I figured the nails</i>
<i>were gonna make everything</i>

10:36.802 --> 10:38.512
<i>look a little hairy,</i>
<i>so I chose to go with a bat.</i>

10:38.596 --> 10:40.431
<i>- Last week the judges</i>
<i>gave you some critiques</i>

10:40.514 --> 10:41.766
about playing it safe.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.225
- I'm not messing
around anymore.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.477
<i>- It came out really strong.</i>

10:44.560 --> 10:46.145
<i>I love</i>
<i>the soft shading pattern</i>

10:46.228 --> 10:47.772
<i>of the little nails</i>
<i>with the shadows.</i>

10:47.855 --> 10:49.523
<i>The different uses</i>
<i>of different nails</i>

10:49.607 --> 10:51.567
<i>gives it a lot</i>
<i>of flow and texture.</i>

10:51.650 --> 10:53.277
- I really like the big nails

10:53.361 --> 10:54.904
<i>that you put in</i>
<i>off the crest of the wings</i>

10:54.987 --> 10:56.697
<i>to really show</i>
<i>that shading coming out.</i>

10:56.781 --> 10:58.991
You really showed a lot
of precision and finesse.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.409
- Awesome.
<i>- What bull[bleep].</i>

11:00.493 --> 11:02.912
I think the judges
are just shocked

11:02.995 --> 11:04.413
that he could do anything

11:04.497 --> 11:06.290
<i>besides a tiny,</i>
<i>little Safe Sally piece.</i>

11:06.374 --> 11:09.502
I guess it pays
to just not work hard.

11:09.585 --> 11:13.089
- All right, guys, today we're
testing precision with nail art.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.591
{\an3}Although Craig and Chris
swung for the fences,

11:15.674 --> 11:16.759
they may have struck out.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.677
- Chris really swung.

11:18.761 --> 11:19.053
<i>It just--leaving it unfinished</i>
<i>is what's hurting him.</i>

11:19.136 --> 11:21.514
<i>- Yeah.</i>

11:21.597 --> 11:23.099
<i>- The top half</i>
<i>really falls flat for me.</i>

11:23.182 --> 11:24.600
<i>The hair, the wings up top,</i>
<i>very unfinished.</i>

11:24.683 --> 11:27.478
{\an1}The thing for me
with Craig's design

11:27.561 --> 11:30.439
<i>is the final execution doesn't</i>
<i>follow that precision mindset.</i>

11:30.523 --> 11:32.316
<i>The fact that you can see more</i>

11:32.400 --> 11:34.610
<i>of his initial pencil</i>
<i>outline sketch</i>

11:34.693 --> 11:37.071
than you can of anybody
else's is a big downfall.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.364
- It's a big mess.

11:38.447 --> 11:41.492
<i>- Duffy did a really nice job</i>
<i>with the peacock feather.</i>

11:41.575 --> 11:43.035
<i>- She didn't waste time</i>

11:43.119 --> 11:44.703
<i>nailing a bunch</i>
<i>of big nails everywhere.</i>

11:44.787 --> 11:46.747
<i>She only put it in the eye</i>
<i>of that feather,</i>

11:46.831 --> 11:48.916
and that in a peacock feather
is where the strength is.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.335
<i>- Kruseman did the Tibetan bat.</i>
<i>Really nice job.</i>

11:51.419 --> 11:53.003
<i>- It's a loose, organic feel,</i>

11:53.087 --> 11:55.297
<i>but there's still a lot</i>
<i>of precision in there.</i>

11:55.381 --> 11:56.632
It comes off as
one of the most

11:56.715 --> 11:57.967
well-finished-out
pieces of the day.

11:58.050 --> 12:01.137
<i>- One of my favorites was Matt,</i>
<i>who did the anvil.</i>

12:01.220 --> 12:03.431
<i>- It had a very strong,</i>
<i>very graphic, bold look.</i>

12:03.514 --> 12:06.183
<i>He knocked it</i>
<i>out of the park.</i>

12:06.267 --> 12:07.810
- The person who wins
this flash challenge

12:07.893 --> 12:09.311
is gonna win the advantage,

12:09.395 --> 12:11.897
{\an3}and at this point of
the competition that is crucial.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.607
Want to let 'em know?
- Yeah.

12:14.608 --> 12:18.487
- Today you had to show
precision.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.239
The judges have decided

12:20.322 --> 12:24.201
<i>the winner of today's flash</i>
<i>challenge is...</i>

12:24.285 --> 12:27.037
Kruseman.
- Awesome. Thank you.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.164
<i>There's no feeling like this.</i>

12:28.247 --> 12:30.499
{\an8}Of course I wouldn't know
what it feels like to win,

12:30.583 --> 12:31.959
{\an8}'cause I've lost
every other flash challenge,

12:32.042 --> 12:33.419
<i>but to win this one</i>
<i>is pretty awesome.</i>

12:33.502 --> 12:35.004
<i>- Overall, your piece just</i>

12:35.087 --> 12:36.839
<i>really showed a lot</i>
<i>of different dimension.</i>

12:36.922 --> 12:37.840
I love the imagery, and I think
it's a well-earned win.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.676
- Kruseman, you'll have
the power to assign

12:40.759 --> 12:43.596
all human canvases
for the elimination tattoo.

12:43.679 --> 12:46.015
<i>- I know that Kruseman</i>
<i>is buddy-buddy with Duffy</i>

12:46.098 --> 12:47.475
<i>and Craig and Matt.</i>

12:47.558 --> 12:49.560
{\an8}I'm the only available target.

12:49.643 --> 12:50.352
<i>I know that I'm screwed</i>
<i>on this one.</i>

12:50.436 --> 12:51.812
<i>- Head back to the loft</i>

12:51.896 --> 12:54.315
and prepare
for the next elimination tattoo.

12:54.398 --> 12:59.153
<i>[intense music]</i>

12:59.236 --> 13:02.990
{\an3}- The last two people that had
skull handouts went home.

13:03.073 --> 13:03.782
- Nobody's bulletproof here.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.493
{\an1}You just have to be
the one person

13:05.576 --> 13:07.870
who doesn't make a mistake.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.622
{\an3}- Kruseman,
he's in trouble.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.790
- Kruseman's strategy
in this may send him home.

13:11.874 --> 13:12.958
<i>He really screwed himself.</i>

13:15.836 --> 13:17.838
<i>[exciting music]</i>

13:21.300 --> 13:22.092
{\an3}- I think it's
pretty [ bleep] awesome

13:22.176 --> 13:24.428
{\an3}that we're the last team
in this game.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.431
{\an3}My main goal
with this skull pick

13:27.515 --> 13:30.518
{\an3}is to ensure that me and you
both go to this finale.

13:30.601 --> 13:31.602
- This is how
it was meant to be,

13:31.685 --> 13:33.312
{\an1}<i>me and you</i>
<i>in the end together.</i>

13:33.395 --> 13:35.940
{\an3}- But the last two people
that had skull handouts

13:36.023 --> 13:38.400
{\an3}went home after they
handed their skulls out.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.070
{\an3}So, like, kind of a little
freaked out about that.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.988
I got to be honest.
I'm nervous.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.241
<i>I can't stop thinking</i>
<i>about the death trap</i>

13:45.324 --> 13:46.116
<i>that these skull picks</i>
<i>could be.</i>

13:46.200 --> 13:48.953
{\an3}I could just as easily
sabotage myself.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.204
- Nobody's bulletproof here.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.581
{\an1}If somebody's gonna [bleep] up,
they're going to [bleep] up.

13:52.665 --> 13:53.457
- There's five tattooers
left in this competition,

13:53.541 --> 13:56.001
{\an3}and we all obviously
have faults.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.545
{\an3}You know what I mean?
Everybody's got a weakness.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.505
- You just have to be
the one person

13:59.588 --> 14:01.048
who doesn't make the mistake.

14:03.509 --> 14:07.221
{\an8}<i>[intense music]</i>

14:07.304 --> 14:15.479
{\an8}<i>♪ ♪</i>

14:15.563 --> 14:16.855
<i>- Welcome.</i>

14:16.939 --> 14:20.776
Only one master
and apprentice pair remains.

14:20.859 --> 14:25.906
<i>The tiniest mistake could cost</i>
<i>you your shot at $100,000,</i>

14:25.990 --> 14:28.158
<i>a feature in</i>
<i>"Inked Magazine,"</i>

14:28.242 --> 14:29.868
and the title of Ink Master.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.913
This week
we're testing precision.

14:32.997 --> 14:36.166
<i>- Precision is</i>
<i>the use of accuracy</i>

14:36.250 --> 14:38.335
{\an8}to show perfect detail
in a tattoo.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.753
<i>If any little detail's</i>
<i>a millimeter off,</i>

14:39.837 --> 14:42.631
the tattoo's
completely [bleep].

14:42.715 --> 14:46.385
<i>- There is no tattoo</i>
<i>that requires more precision</i>

14:46.468 --> 14:49.513
than a portrait.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.099
{\an8}- Portraits have showed
their ugly face in the building.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.142
<i>If you don't use precision</i>

14:53.225 --> 14:55.477
<i>and put things where</i>
<i>they're supposed to be,</i>

14:55.561 --> 14:57.187
it's not gonna look
like that person.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.064
- To tattoo
an accurate portrait,

14:59.148 --> 15:00.983
<i>you must capture</i>
<i>the subject's likeness</i>

15:01.066 --> 15:03.944
by precisely placing
every single drop of ink.

15:04.028 --> 15:08.282
<i>A facial feature</i>
<i>even a millimeter out of place</i>

15:08.365 --> 15:10.993
could change the appearance
of your portrait entirely.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.119
<i>- I don't do portraits</i>

15:12.202 --> 15:14.872
{\an8}because one little slip-up,
man, and you're gonna

15:14.955 --> 15:15.956
{\an8}<i>make your tattoo look</i>
<i>like Sloth in "The Goonies,"</i>

15:16.040 --> 15:18.500
{\an8}and that's the last thing
I want to do.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.669
{\an8}<i>- Portraits are some of</i>
<i>the most popular tattoos</i>

15:20.753 --> 15:23.714
{\an8}because canvases can have
a loved one with them forever.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.758
{\an8}<i>For your canvases</i>
<i>and subjects today</i>

15:25.841 --> 15:28.093
{\an8}this is especially important...
- What?

15:28.177 --> 15:30.846
{\an8}<i>- Because they are often</i>
<i>separated by thousands of miles</i>

15:30.929 --> 15:32.348
{\an8}for long periods of time.

15:32.431 --> 15:36.185
{\an8}They are all active military.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.478
{\an8}- Wow.
Awesome.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.730
{\an8}- And they're all
about to be deployed.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.607
{\an8}- Oh, man.
- Serious.

15:41.690 --> 15:44.360
{\an8}- Portrait.
Man, this is my day.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.528
<i>Kruseman, you can throw</i>
<i>anything you want at me.</i>

15:46.612 --> 15:48.322
<i>This is my style.</i>

15:48.405 --> 15:50.699
I've got the win,
no matter what you do.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.618
- Guys, there's
no liberties in this.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.703
<i>These are accurate portraits.</i>

15:54.787 --> 15:57.539
Your tattoo versus
the picture side-by-side.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.583
<i>No reason for</i>
<i>changing anything.</i>

15:59.667 --> 16:01.210
<i>Make these things count,</i>

16:01.293 --> 16:03.671
because one of you guys
is going home.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.547
<i>- Let's meet your canvases.</i>

16:07.966 --> 16:09.009
{\an8}- Oh...

16:13.180 --> 16:15.224
- Kruseman,
you won the flash challenge.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.893
<i>You now have the power</i>
<i>to assign all human canvases.</i>

16:17.976 --> 16:22.356
Be precise.
Your future depends on it.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.108
{\an8}- I can count on one hand

16:24.191 --> 16:26.068
{\an8}how many portraits I've done
in my whole entire career.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.903
For me to get this
skull pick is awesome.

16:27.986 --> 16:30.239
{\an1}How's it going?
What would you like to get?

16:30.322 --> 16:31.407
- I'm active duty Air Force.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.283
{\an3}I travel all the time,
so I'd like to get a portrait

16:33.367 --> 16:34.702
of my wife on my thigh

16:34.785 --> 16:36.036
so she can be with me
everywhere I go.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.080
- Black and gray or color?
- Black and gray.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.665
- What are you
wanting to get?

16:39.748 --> 16:41.166
{\an3}- I would like to
get a portrait of my wife.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.501
{\an1}- Where are you thinking
about doing this at?

16:42.584 --> 16:44.586
{\an8}- In the upper arm.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.505
<i>- She has so much hair.</i>

16:46.588 --> 16:49.133
<i>This is going to be hard</i>
<i>to translate into a tattoo.</i>

16:49.216 --> 16:50.801
{\an8}I feel sorry for
whoever gets this person.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.261
- I'd like a color portrait

16:52.344 --> 16:54.763
{\an3}of my son's
Navy boot camp picture.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.390
Proudest day of my life.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.017
- I am in the Navy,

16:59.101 --> 17:00.519
and I want to get
a picture of my husband

17:00.602 --> 17:01.770
right here over my heart.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.440
<i>- Bald guy on the chest.</i>

17:04.522 --> 17:06.983
{\an8}There is not enough distinctive
features to show precision.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.402
{\an8}No thanks.

17:08.484 --> 17:09.819
{\an8}- I want to get a portrait
of my father

17:09.903 --> 17:11.613

Speaking about
precision specifically,

26:09.484 --> 26:12.988
<i>there are really great examples</i>

26:13.071 --> 26:15.031

26:16.157 --> 26:18.451
<i>It's those fine details.</i>

26:18.535 --> 26:19.911
<i>- That's why</i>
<i>I picked this one.</i>

26:19.995 --> 26:21.496
There was the least amount
of face to do,

26:21.579 --> 26:23.456
<i>and I am not</i>
<i>a portrait tattooer,</i>

26:23.540 --> 26:26.209
so I figured that that was
my only hope of holding on.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.836
<i>- It looks like some</i>
<i>of the shading in the face</i>

26:27.919 --> 26:30.755
<i>got away from you, especially</i>
<i>that line in the nose.</i>

26:30.839 --> 26:32.257
- This is the trouble part.

26:32.340 --> 26:33.550
<i>The shading</i>
<i>you put in the nose</i>

26:33.633 --> 26:35.260
<i>takes the nose</i>
<i>in the wrong direction.</i>

26:35.343 --> 26:36.511
It looks like the nose
is going this way,

26:36.594 --> 26:38.179
and the face
is going that way.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.806
<i>His chin going</i>
<i>into his neck,</i>

26:39.889 --> 26:42.642
<i>you needed to up the definition</i>
<i>of that a little bit</i>

26:42.726 --> 26:45.562
to show which one of these
crease lines is his actual face

26:45.645 --> 26:47.314
and which one is the neck.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.316
<i>- We see what you did</i>
<i>inside the jacket</i>

26:49.399 --> 26:50.567
<i>with the tie and that</i>
<i>reflection of the shirt.</i>

26:50.650 --> 26:53.111
You were confident
'cause it wasn't the face.

26:53.194 --> 26:54.529
- I totally was.

26:54.612 --> 26:55.822
- If you're not
confident in a face,

26:55.905 --> 26:57.032
<i>don't treat it like a face.</i>

26:57.115 --> 26:57.907
Just treat it as shapes,

26:57.991 --> 26:59.909
<i>and go in</i>
<i>with the same confidence</i>

26:59.993 --> 27:01.619
<i>that you go in</i>
<i>in the jacket area,</i>

27:01.703 --> 27:03.163
<i>because you can do it.</i>

27:03.246 --> 27:04.581
There are examples
of the precision

27:04.664 --> 27:06.499
that's necessary
to hit those things.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.375
<i>- It's painstakingly obvious</i>

27:07.459 --> 27:09.753
that portraits
are not your thing.

27:12.922 --> 27:15.091
- Duffy.

27:16.634 --> 27:19.637
- One thing I will say
about your portrait

27:19.721 --> 27:22.057
<i>is you do have smooth,</i>
<i>good areas of gray,</i>

27:22.140 --> 27:24.434
<i>but the really heavy cheeks</i>
<i>that you gave her--</i>

27:24.517 --> 27:27.228
<i>those really weren't</i>
<i>as pronounced in the photo.</i>

27:27.312 --> 27:29.898
<i>You changed her face</i>
<i>completely by sagging her out,</i>

27:29.981 --> 27:31.775
{\an3}<i>and because you didn't shade</i>
<i>the two back teeth on the right</i>

27:31.858 --> 27:35.570
<i>as dark as it is in the photo,</i>
<i>you give her buck teeth.</i>

27:35.653 --> 27:37.864
- Here's one
of the trickiest things.

27:37.947 --> 27:41.159
<i>The problem with your hair</i>
<i>is where it meets the head.</i>

27:41.242 --> 27:43.912
<i>It looks like she's bald,</i>
<i>and she's wearing a wig,</i>

27:43.995 --> 27:45.080
<i>and the wig is slipping off</i>
<i>to the back.</i>

27:45.163 --> 27:48.249
I think it's obvious that
portraits are not your thing.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.376
- Not all the time, yeah.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.044
<i>- You put a real crease</i>

27:51.127 --> 27:52.962
<i>between the bridge of her nose</i>
<i>up to her eyebrow</i>

27:53.046 --> 27:55.924
that totally re-contoured
the lay of the land.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.592
<i>You don't capture the spirit.</i>

27:57.675 --> 28:00.845
You don't capture
the personality of the face.

28:00.929 --> 28:03.431
This really doesn't look
like this person.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.520
- Craig.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.357
<i>You went all black and gray.</i>
<i>Why is that?</i>

28:12.440 --> 28:14.150
<i>- That's the one thing</i>
<i>I can't shy away from this time</i>

28:14.234 --> 28:15.777
is the black and gray.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.112
Everyone sees that
you're hiding away from it,

28:17.195 --> 28:18.571
and that's what's going to get
thrown at me every single time,

28:18.655 --> 28:21.449
so I'd rather just
jump into it and do it.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.952
- It's really great to see you
do a real black-and-gray tattoo.

28:24.035 --> 28:26.246
<i>Nice wash shading.</i>
<i>Heavy dark blacks.</i>

28:26.329 --> 28:27.455
<i>Nice smooth transitions.</i>

28:27.539 --> 28:29.833
This is the way to attack this.

28:29.916 --> 28:31.418
<i>You went into it</i>
<i>to prove a point,</i>

28:31.501 --> 28:33.503
and I think
you definitely did.

28:33.586 --> 28:35.839
<i>Overall it does have a little</i>
<i>bit of a graphic feel to it.</i>

28:35.922 --> 28:37.966
<i>It's not until you really</i>
<i>get in and start critiquing,</i>

28:38.049 --> 28:40.468
you see how graphic
and dark this long shadow is

28:40.552 --> 28:42.220
<i>down the side of his face.</i>

28:42.303 --> 28:43.888
<i>I think you could have taken</i>
<i>the black tones</i>

28:43.972 --> 28:45.473
<i>in your face</i>
<i>down a little bit.</i>

28:45.557 --> 28:47.225
<i>You want the eyebrows,</i>
<i>the pupils,</i>

28:47.308 --> 28:49.853
<i>and the goatee to be the</i>
<i>darkest parts of the tattoo.</i>

28:49.936 --> 28:51.688
- We haven't
seen this from you,

28:51.771 --> 28:53.815
and you getting the bald guy,
I immediately was like,

28:53.898 --> 28:57.735
"Oof," 'cause in my opinion
this would be the toughie,

28:57.819 --> 29:00.321
but you were able to put down
some tricks that really worked.

29:00.405 --> 29:01.823
<i>This is much better</i>

29:01.906 --> 29:02.449
<i>than I thought</i>
<i>I was gonna see from you.</i>

29:02.532 --> 29:04.284
I wasn't expecting it.

29:04.367 --> 29:04.784
<i>Good job, man.</i>

29:08.246 --> 29:11.040
- Matt.

29:11.124 --> 29:14.586
- Anybody who knows this woman,
they're gonna take one glance

29:14.669 --> 29:16.838
at this tattoo
and instantly know it's her.

29:16.921 --> 29:17.755
<i>- I was excited</i>
<i>to get this canvas.</i>

29:17.839 --> 29:20.425
I was stoked
to get to do all the hair.

29:20.508 --> 29:22.302
<i>- Capturing the personality</i>
<i>of someone,</i>

29:22.385 --> 29:23.636
<i>capturing the spirit of them,</i>

29:23.720 --> 29:25.513
<i>and really making</i>
<i>it recognizable,</i>

29:25.597 --> 29:27.056
that's one
of the hardest challenges

29:27.140 --> 29:28.141
<i>about doing a portrait,</i>

29:28.224 --> 29:30.852
<i>so in that part</i>
<i>I think you did a great job.</i>

29:30.935 --> 29:32.854
But when you get
into the precision

29:32.937 --> 29:34.856
<i>and you compare side-by-side</i>
<i>with the photo,</i>

29:34.939 --> 29:38.443
there are little areas
that are a little off.

29:38.526 --> 29:41.070
<i>- You really defined the cheeks</i>
<i>and the chin line.</i>

29:41.154 --> 29:42.864
<i>You should have</i>
<i>made 'em out of focus,</i>

29:42.947 --> 29:44.824
and you would have made
her younger.

29:44.908 --> 29:47.243
<i>Also you emphasized the ridge</i>
<i>of the nose up top,</i>

29:47.327 --> 29:49.704
so that gives us another
wrinkle that she doesn't have.

29:49.787 --> 29:51.623
- I think that
you lucked out on this pick,

29:51.706 --> 29:54.667
<i>because I feel that</i>
<i>this photograph and this woman</i>

29:54.751 --> 29:57.504
<i>has so much character</i>
<i>that's uniquely hers</i>

29:57.587 --> 30:01.966
that in translation
nailing 80% of those things

30:02.050 --> 30:06.179
makes it look like her.

30:06.262 --> 30:09.057
Chris.

30:09.140 --> 30:13.186
When Kruseman gave you this
canvas, what was your feeling?

30:13.269 --> 30:15.146
- I can't believe that he
handed me the color portrait.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.856
<i>That's, like,</i>
<i>handing me a gold medal.</i>

30:16.940 --> 30:18.608
<i>- When I look at the tattoo,</i>
<i>I love it.</i>

30:18.691 --> 30:21.236
Really a beautiful tattoo.
- Thank you.

30:21.319 --> 30:24.280
<i>Today is, you know, a special</i>
<i>day with the military guys,</i>

30:24.364 --> 30:25.782
and every one of them
that's gonna deploy--

30:25.865 --> 30:27.617
I've been there.

30:27.700 --> 30:30.870
<i>20 years ago, my 11-man team</i>
<i>was sent to Bosnia</i>

30:30.954 --> 30:33.873
as part of a special operations
Marine expeditionary unit.

30:33.957 --> 30:37.293
There was no stores,
nowhere to buy gifts,

30:37.377 --> 30:39.128
and so I ended up
drawing a lot of portraits

30:39.212 --> 30:41.881
and pictures of kids
and family members and all that.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.967
<i>The guys would send 'em home</i>
<i>for presents,</i>

30:44.050 --> 30:46.594
so they're the ones
that encouraged me to tattoo.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.013
So coming here and giving
these ladies and gentlemen

30:49.097 --> 30:50.598
the opportunity
to have a keepsake

30:50.682 --> 30:52.725
right before they get
deployed was special.

30:52.809 --> 30:54.060
- Well, Chris,
I think you did an amazing job.

30:54.143 --> 30:56.938
<i>It's definitely bulletproof.</i>
<i>It is definitely solid.</i>

30:57.021 --> 30:59.857
<i>The attention</i>
<i>to detail in the clothing</i>

30:59.941 --> 31:03.111
and the fabric in the flag
set this thing off,

31:03.194 --> 31:04.112
<i>and this thing is strong, man.</i>

31:04.195 --> 31:06.739
- I think it's hard
to do a color portrait

31:06.823 --> 31:08.950
<i>that's gonna</i>
<i>have that realistic look.</i>

31:09.033 --> 31:11.786
<i>The face itself looks</i>
<i>like a poster to join the Navy.</i>

31:11.869 --> 31:12.787
<i>It could be his brother,</i>
<i>his cousin,</i>

31:12.870 --> 31:14.581
<i>or anybody</i>
<i>that looks a little similar.</i>

31:14.664 --> 31:17.292
It looks like an illustration.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.960
<i>It's a technically</i>
<i>precise tattoo,</i>

31:19.043 --> 31:21.671
but you're lacking
the photorealism qualities

31:21.754 --> 31:25.592
that make it look
like a photo.

31:27.552 --> 31:30.305
- It's time to poll the judges

31:30.388 --> 31:31.889
<i>and find out who had</i>
<i>the best tattoo of the day.</i>

31:31.973 --> 31:35.643
- For me, it's a dead heat
between Chris and Matt.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.895
{\an8}Matt's really captured
the look of the person,

31:37.979 --> 31:39.397
{\an8}but from the technical
application standpoint

31:39.480 --> 31:42.191
{\an8}Chris' tattoo stands out.

31:42.275 --> 31:44.152
- Chris made it so fresh
and clean and vibrant,

31:44.235 --> 31:46.821
and just looking at fabric
textures and qualities,

31:46.904 --> 31:49.490
<i>holy [bleep],</i>
<i>he killed it.</i>

31:49.574 --> 31:51.826
<i>Matt's black and gray</i>
<i>is beautiful.</i>

31:51.909 --> 31:53.828
<i>The only fault I find in it</i>

31:53.911 --> 31:56.706
<i>is that she's older</i>
<i>than she is in the photo.</i>

31:56.789 --> 31:59.000
- Today the word is precision.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.794
<i>If you just account</i>
<i>for the fabric, the flag,</i>

32:01.878 --> 32:04.839
<i>the shirt, the knot,</i>
<i>the detail in the hat,</i>

32:04.922 --> 32:06.674
<i>all that stuff, there's</i>
<i>definitely more examples</i>

32:06.758 --> 32:09.052
<i>of precision in Chris'.</i>

32:09.135 --> 32:11.679

black-and-gray portrait guy,

34:14.886 --> 34:16.429
