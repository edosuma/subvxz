WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:09.990
Are you asking me if I think my
dead partner was screwing around?

00:10.040 --> 00:13.440
They're going to kill us. A copper's
dead. And now they're coming for us.

00:15.160 --> 00:18.310
What you doing here, Adam? You
want a relationship with a woman

00:18.360 --> 00:21.230
- who doesn't even know who the father is.
- Well, I love you.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.870
Stay away from Frank Linnell.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.630
I've got a bit of a reputation.
Paul was my friend, I'm devastated.

00:26.680 --> 00:27.910
- You Ray Jackson?
- Yeah.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.270
- Who was the other passenger, Ray?
- Kevin Sherwood.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.870
The last thing you want is for
something to happen to your baby.

00:32.920 --> 00:33.990
Mr Sherwood doesn't like

00:34.040 --> 00:36.640
people sticking their nose
in where it's not wanted.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:17.440 --> 02:18.560
And who are you, then?

02:19.720 --> 02:21.350
Kevin Sherwood.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.910
I've taken pictures of
your car reg and your face

02:23.960 --> 02:26.920
and I've sent them to my boss,
so if anything happens to me...

02:29.120 --> 02:30.950
And you are Helen?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.350
Paul's girlfriend?

02:32.400 --> 02:33.870
How do you know where I live?

02:33.920 --> 02:36.950
When Ray described you, I figured it out.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.230
You know who you are and the
fact that you weren't there

02:39.280 --> 02:41.470
in any official capacity.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.750
See, Ray's not the sharpest
knife in the drawer.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.710
It's probably why he drives a cab.

02:45.760 --> 02:49.200
Claps eyes on a warrant card and
makes all kinds of assumptions.

02:50.720 --> 02:53.230
But I know what happened to Paul.

02:53.280 --> 02:56.350
- What did happen to him?
- You're just probably trying to work out

02:56.400 --> 02:59.230
- what me and Paul were discussing.
- You going to tell me?

02:59.280 --> 03:01.750
Well, whoever's
investigating Paul's death,

03:01.800 --> 03:03.870
they're not looking at the likes of me.

03:03.920 --> 03:07.200
Probably looking at someone a bit
younger than me, a bit blacker.

03:09.200 --> 03:12.230
Helen, I think it's best
if you leave it alone.

03:12.280 --> 03:13.870
Best for who?

03:13.920 --> 03:14.910
You.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.750
- Is that a warning?
- It's not a warning.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.470
OK, Helen!

03:19.520 --> 03:22.030
Just tell yourself he
needed a bit of extra money.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.350
He had a kid on the way,
so he wanted a bigger house.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.350
Tell yourself he was doing it for you.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.560
Piss off and leave me alone.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.350
Hiya.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.790
I'm, er, I'm police.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.790
I just going to leave my car here.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.600
OK.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.240
Hey, it's me. I want to see you.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.680
You all right?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.960
Here's what I want you to do.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.080
I want you to take your clothes off.

05:17.440 --> 05:20.070
Have sex with me and then hold me.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.720
And make me feel safe.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.200
Can you do that?

05:52.560 --> 05:54.270
Hi, it's Theo. Is Javine there?

05:54.320 --> 05:55.390
Hold on.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.760
It's for you.

05:58.880 --> 06:03.070
- Theo? You OK? Where are you?
- Yeah, I'm cool.

06:03.120 --> 06:08.630
- I've found a place to hide out. What
time can I pass by? - This afternoon.

06:08.680 --> 06:13.070
- But make sure you're not followed.
- OK. - Really make sure, Theo.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.510
Look, I won't. I got a
couple of routes in mind,

06:15.560 --> 06:17.670
and I won't decide till the last minute.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.270
Be careful. And don't
go where people know ya.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.070
I won't.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.950
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.080
- I love you.
- Love you too.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.360
We need to talk about this.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.390
About what? What, the fact
that I had sex with you

07:02.440 --> 07:04.550
when I was perfectly
happy in my relationship?

07:04.600 --> 07:06.430
But you weren't happy, were you?

07:06.480 --> 07:08.270
You wanted something different.

07:08.320 --> 07:12.030
Oh, come on, you complimented
my legs at a party

07:12.080 --> 07:15.350
and the next thing I was
just spreading them for you.

07:15.400 --> 07:18.640
We all think that our
problems are so unique.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.040
I was so complicated.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.240
Hey...

07:26.960 --> 07:29.990
- You can't just...
- What? Leave?

07:30.040 --> 07:32.630
I'm pregnant and I'm grieving.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.710
That gives me licence to
do just about anything.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.920
Helen. Helen, come here.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.720
You need to let me in.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.200
I'm sorry.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.040
- Stay as long as you like.
- Thanks.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.400
I'll bring my things tomorrow.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.550
Hello?

09:37.600 --> 09:39.510
Yeah, hi, it's Theo.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.760
Can you tell Javine I can't make it?

10:02.080 --> 10:03.600
Dad!

10:06.600 --> 10:08.000
Here.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.190
When did you get here?

10:11.240 --> 10:14.510
- This morning.
- What time is it?

10:14.560 --> 10:16.470
- 11.
- 11?

10:16.520 --> 10:18.600
Come on, doing a fry up.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.680
Here you are.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.990
Have you thought of any hymns yet?

10:35.040 --> 10:38.600
I assume you're having
hymns, or pop music?

10:40.280 --> 10:42.270
Pop music.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.510
The hit parade.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.670
Hey, I download.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.400
I'm not a dinosaur yet, you know!

10:50.400 --> 10:52.280
No, I haven't thought of any.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.160
Every time I do, it just...

10:58.840 --> 11:00.600
.. just reminds me he's dead.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.670
I was... going to ask if
I could help carry him,

11:08.720 --> 11:10.630
carry the coffin.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.670
You've probably got friends
who can do it, but...

11:12.720 --> 11:14.240
No it'll be, erm...

11:15.560 --> 11:21.150
It'll be coppers. Erm, honour
guard, in dress uniform.

11:21.200 --> 11:24.790
It's Paul's mum, she wants
the whole ceremonial bit.

11:24.840 --> 11:28.800
She sent me an e-mail,
very strongly worded one.

11:30.280 --> 11:36.910
She wants, like, 26 gun
salute, and trumpets, and...

11:36.960 --> 11:38.720
all that bullshit.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.000
Did you like him? Paul?

11:48.080 --> 11:50.920
And don't... don't just
say yes cos he's dead.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.720
Did you really like him?

11:56.760 --> 11:58.120
Most of the time.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.750
He could be arrogant, especially
with a beer inside him,

12:01.800 --> 12:04.000
and, of course, he was a City fan, so...

12:05.800 --> 12:07.520
Yes, I liked him.

12:10.320 --> 12:11.600
We talked...

12:13.080 --> 12:15.920
.. about you, about the baby.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.160
He was looking forward to it.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.040
Did you trust him?

12:26.880 --> 12:28.360
Didn't you?

12:30.400 --> 12:31.880
I thought I did.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.000
Hey.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.030
Hey, Easy, what's up?

13:09.080 --> 13:12.310
Yo, need to see ya, today.

13:12.360 --> 13:15.310
Today? Oh, I can't today,
I got some stuff to do.

13:15.360 --> 13:18.760
Nah, today. I'll come grab ya. Sweet.

13:24.200 --> 13:27.190
'17-year-old Meekaaeel Qureshi's
young life was cut short

13:27.240 --> 13:31.110
by a violent and terrifying
gun attack yesterday.

13:31.160 --> 13:33.910
Combined with the recent
disappearance of James Desunmo

13:33.960 --> 13:36.630
otherwise known as Snap, police
are working on the assumption

13:36.680 --> 13:39.790
that rival gangs may have become
engaged in a deadly turf war.

13:39.840 --> 13:42.830
The police are determined to prevent
the violence from escalating.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.670
They are warning residents
not to retaliate

13:45.720 --> 13:46.960
and are appealing...

13:51.160 --> 13:52.150
DCI Carter.

13:52.200 --> 13:55.630
- Hey, Ted, it's me, Helen.
- Helen, how are you doing?

13:55.680 --> 13:57.910
I'm just curious, how's
that investigation going?

13:57.960 --> 14:00.550
Well, we're confident that the
boys involved in that shooting

14:00.600 --> 14:02.670
are from the same estate
that the lad's been killed.

14:02.720 --> 14:06.310
- We're conducting more
door-to-doors. - And?

14:06.360 --> 14:11.160
- You know what it's like on these estates.
- Yep, wall of silence.

14:29.240 --> 14:31.910
Just been chillin', yeah!

14:31.960 --> 14:33.280
Hey.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.880
It's really sad, isn't it?

14:38.320 --> 14:40.360
They say it's gang related.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.880
Talking about all sorts,
they don't know shit.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.350
Right.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.960
What do you reckon?

14:50.080 --> 14:53.560
If it's a war, the other crew
won't know what's hit 'em.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.510
What's the other crew?

14:57.560 --> 15:00.190
Are you all part of... of that crew?

15:00.240 --> 15:03.510
- Maybe. - So, you knew
them, Wave and Easy?

15:03.560 --> 15:06.510
- Everyone knows Wave. - Is he the
leader? - Are you some sort of cop?

15:06.560 --> 15:10.790
- Come on, look at me, do I look like a cop?
- You look like a MILF.

15:12.280 --> 15:16.400
- Wouldn't even need a condom.
- All right, thanks for your time.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.790
- Hiya. - Hi. - Helen. Nice to meet you.

15:25.840 --> 15:28.150
- You didn't know him, did you?
- Nah.

15:28.200 --> 15:31.070
Did you hear about the killings that
happened recently, two young boys?

15:31.120 --> 15:33.910
Yeah. Well, it happens all
the time round here, don't it?

15:33.960 --> 15:35.150
Why, who are you, anyway?

15:35.200 --> 15:37.150
I'm just... I know it
sounds silly, I just...

15:37.200 --> 15:40.030
I got moved by the story, I
just wanted to find out...

15:40.080 --> 15:42.350
You shouldn't be walking
around here like that, anyway.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.550
- Did you hear about the killings
that happened? Young lads. - Yeah.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.990
It's no more than the
little bastards deserve.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.230
They bring it all on themselves.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.070
I seen him around but I
didn't know him, like,

15:52.120 --> 15:54.190
you know what I mean? I
didn't really know him, like.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.110
Now recently, there's
been nothing like that.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.350
There's been nothing, has it?

15:57.400 --> 15:58.790
No, it's been really quiet.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.830
Did you hear about the
killings that went on?

16:00.880 --> 16:02.870
Aye, everyone's heard
about them, you know?

16:02.920 --> 16:04.720
There's not much we can do.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.150
Are you OK?

16:14.200 --> 16:17.270
Yeah. Just, er...

16:17.320 --> 16:18.870
nausea.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.270
The baby.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.470
I've got a son. Leon.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.630
Going to see him later. Can't wait.

16:24.680 --> 16:27.670
- God, you don't seem old enough.
- Started young.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.710
Everything starts young round here.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.830
- Even murder?
- What?

16:31.880 --> 16:33.550
I-I saw that story on the news,

16:33.600 --> 16:37.590
about that boy and, I dunno, must be
my hormones, but it really moved me.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.790
- Right.
- Did you know him?

16:39.840 --> 16:42.870
- Mikey.
- Kind of.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.470
And what about that other boy,
who they said went missing?

16:45.520 --> 16:49.670
- Well, I'd seen him round. He was a
good guy. You know. - Yo. Tee! Theo!

16:49.720 --> 16:53.840
- One sec, Wave. - Come on, man!
Hurry up, man! - All right, sorry!

17:16.040 --> 17:17.800
Hello?

17:19.119 --> 17:20.520
Hello?

17:25.720 --> 17:27.680
Hello?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.110
Hello?

17:43.160 --> 17:46.070
Helen, it's Jess Harlow
from the Coroner's Office.

17:46.120 --> 17:50.390
- Oh, right. Did... Did
you just call me? - No.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.110
Oh, you, er, you...

17:53.160 --> 17:55.360
- you didn't just call me?
- No.

17:56.920 --> 18:02.310
OK, erm, right, well,
wha-what do you want?

18:02.360 --> 18:04.910
It's regarding Paul. Is this a good time?

18:04.960 --> 18:08.710
Yeah, yeah, no, this is
as good a time as any.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.790
OK well, the senior investigating
officer has conferred

18:11.840 --> 18:14.470
with the coroner and they're
happy to authorise burial,

18:14.520 --> 18:17.270
issuing a temporary death certificate.

18:17.320 --> 18:18.390
In the light of this,

18:18.440 --> 18:21.360
the SIO would himself be
happy to release Paul's body.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.310
Well, everyone's happy.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.560
I'm sorry?

18:28.960 --> 18:31.040
Nothing. Just, erm...

18:35.200 --> 18:37.710
I'll be happy to...

18:37.760 --> 18:39.040
to have his body to bury.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.560
- All right, thank you.
- Bye-bye.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.120
Stay there.

19:09.360 --> 19:10.750
All right, lads?

19:10.800 --> 19:12.390
Want to be straight.

19:12.440 --> 19:16.990
We don't know which crew is behind
it, so the best thing we can do now

19:17.040 --> 19:20.030
is keep our heads down
till we sort this out.

19:20.080 --> 19:23.110
Wave's going to stay with me at my
bro's. Where are you going to stay?

19:23.160 --> 19:25.510
At-at Javine's mum's.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.070
Wave is getting his
bro's dog for protection,

19:28.120 --> 19:30.920
but I think we need something
with a bit more accuracy.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.160
Take that, bro.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.880
It's kill or be killed, boys.

19:53.120 --> 19:56.640
Hey. Come here.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.000
They brought me his iPad.

20:06.840 --> 20:09.270
I didn't even know he had one.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.470
There's a folder on it.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.110
"Victoria."

20:13.160 --> 20:14.190
Victoria?

20:14.240 --> 20:15.750
Mm-hm.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.670
Password required.

20:18.720 --> 20:19.910
Did you get in it?

20:19.960 --> 20:22.270
But why would he have that?

20:22.320 --> 20:23.840
It could be anything.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.790
Could be a code word, secret file.

20:27.840 --> 20:31.000
Do you want me to speak to tech
and see if they can hack into it?

20:32.240 --> 20:36.910
- I think he was involved with something.
- Something? Like what?

20:36.960 --> 20:39.350
There's this guy called Kevin Sherwood.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.350
Extremely dodgy businessman --

20:41.400 --> 20:45.670
he's got links to credit and debit
card scams and money laundering,

20:45.720 --> 20:48.280
and illegal machinery sales in Nigeria.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.160
He said Paul was helping
him, that they had a deal.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.750
And you believe him?

20:55.800 --> 20:58.680
I don't want to, but...

21:00.000 --> 21:01.510
God, you know what they say, you know --

21:01.560 --> 21:04.280
- if it smells like shit and
it looks like shit... - Helen.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.230
You look like shit.

21:08.280 --> 21:11.590
And you're going to need all your
strength to get through this funeral

21:11.640 --> 21:16.190
and, to be frank, the last thing you
need is to be looking at his coffin

21:16.240 --> 21:19.070
and wondering if he was corrupt.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.230
Are you sure you want
to be alone right now?

21:21.280 --> 21:23.200
Do you want to stay with me?

21:24.240 --> 21:26.440
No, I'm-I'm at my sister's.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.520
OK.

22:08.960 --> 22:12.150
I'm your long-lost twin sister.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.350
I look just like you.

22:14.400 --> 22:20.120
I even have a tiny teeny beard
right on the end of my chin.

22:22.840 --> 22:25.430
It's your doppelganger.

22:25.480 --> 22:29.110
- Oh, my God, she's so ugly!
- Ugly!

22:29.160 --> 22:31.080
I know -- look at you.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.630
Come on!

22:53.680 --> 22:55.510
Yo, the dog won't shit.

22:55.560 --> 22:59.030
- Let's go, bro.
- Come on. Come on!

22:59.080 --> 23:01.630
This dog's useless.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.510
- You want to get high?
- You want to get high?

23:03.560 --> 23:05.120
You want to smoke with me? Ah?

23:06.960 --> 23:09.590
Oh, I ate too much, you
know, way too much.

23:09.640 --> 23:13.560
- Well too much. Come on.
- Belly feels bad! - Hangin'.

23:18.240 --> 23:20.040
We'll have to smoke outside.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.800
Bro.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.360
- Take it down, will you, bro?
- No bother.

23:35.920 --> 23:38.230
- Oh, bro.
- What?

23:38.280 --> 23:40.710
The dog's shit on the floor, man!

23:40.760 --> 23:42.230
Are you taking the piss, bro?

23:42.280 --> 23:44.400
Nah, not outside my bro's yard.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.240
Stay there. I'm getting you a bag.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.270
Dog shit!

23:55.320 --> 23:57.990
- I ain't cleaning that up!
- Scoop it! Scoop it now!

23:58.040 --> 24:00.470
I can't believe you're making me do this!

24:00.520 --> 24:02.190
- I told you don't bring the dog. - Bro!

24:04.000 --> 24:06.120
It's why I don't have a dog, bro!

24:07.320 --> 24:10.600
- Yo, dash it, bro.
- Shit! Come on.

24:16.840 --> 24:18.320
Calm down, you little shit.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.110
- Get down.
- You're mad!

24:38.160 --> 24:40.600
- Down, now.
- All right.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.550
Now this is about Paul Hopkins.

24:44.600 --> 24:48.510
- Who's that? - The police officer
who got killed, waiting for a bus.

24:48.560 --> 24:52.830
- In Gorton, right, yeah, yeah, I seen
it in the pa... - Don't bullshit me!

24:52.880 --> 24:55.470
Right, what do you want to know?

24:55.520 --> 24:59.270
Everything. Like, who else was involved.

24:59.320 --> 25:01.960
All right, just take the gun out my face.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.120
Ah!

25:59.560 --> 26:00.800
Argh!

26:08.160 --> 26:11.880
I've got bleach and I will
use it in your fucking eyes!

26:42.400 --> 26:44.350
DI Moody -- professional standards branch.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.030
What the fuck were you doing in my flat?!

26:46.080 --> 26:48.790
- Wasn't me. - There was a man
-- there was a man in my flat!

26:48.840 --> 26:51.350
Do you want me to have a look?

26:51.400 --> 26:52.910
Let me see.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.270
Follow me in.

26:54.320 --> 26:56.120
Come on, let's have a look.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.190
So? Am I under surveillance?

27:25.240 --> 27:28.030
I wouldn't call it surveillance.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.110
We've been tracking your movements.

27:30.160 --> 27:33.910
- Why? - You ran a vehicle
check on Ray Jackson.

27:33.960 --> 27:36.670
Any enquiry related to him
gets flagged on our system.

27:36.720 --> 27:39.590
We know you've spoken to Kevin Sherwood

27:39.640 --> 27:42.110
and you visited the murder
scene of Meekaaeel Qureshi.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.110
Yes, I also spoke to Frank
Linnell and Sarah Rushton.

27:45.160 --> 27:46.830
I've been all over town, and why,

27:46.880 --> 27:50.110
because I have got 1,000
questions and no answers.

27:50.160 --> 27:53.120
Do you mind telling me how you
came up with Ray Jackson's name?

27:54.240 --> 27:56.440
I found parking tickets.

27:58.080 --> 28:03.110
So I took them to the
CCTV monitoring centre,

28:03.160 --> 28:06.200
and they showed me Paul...

28:09.560 --> 28:12.880
.. stepping into the same
taxi on two separate occasions.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.960
So I did some investigating...

28:19.440 --> 28:21.640
.. and all the signs
point to him being bent.

28:27.680 --> 28:29.470
Paul wasn't corrupt.

28:29.520 --> 28:31.400
He was working for us.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.150
Paul's job was to target fellow officers,

28:46.200 --> 28:49.190
to secure evidence that might
convict anyone passing information

28:49.240 --> 28:52.310
to organised crime figures --
individuals, gangs, whatever.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.350
He was investigating Kevin Sherwood?

28:54.400 --> 28:57.590
Sherwood was a target Paul
was making decent headway on

28:57.640 --> 28:59.590
before his death -- you've met him,

28:59.640 --> 29:02.070
- so you know what kind of
person he is. - A prick.

29:02.120 --> 29:05.070
Correct, and not only that, he's a prick

29:05.120 --> 29:09.070
we suspect has made payments to a
number of officers in various units.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.720
What about Frank Linnell?

29:11.760 --> 29:13.950
He's not someone we have
an active interest in.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.240
Plenty of our colleagues do, of course.

29:17.440 --> 29:19.390
Paul's been in touch with him.

29:19.440 --> 29:20.830
Asking for info.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.110
- What did Linnell say?
- They were friends.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.270
Friends!

29:25.320 --> 29:28.160
- They watched cricket together.
- Right.

29:30.800 --> 29:34.550
I do know for a fact Linnell was
not part of Operation Elizabeth.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.270
- Elizabeth?
- Women's names.

29:37.320 --> 29:39.280
Elizabeth was Kevin Sherwood.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.240
What about Victoria?

30:02.000 --> 30:03.480
It's gone.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.440
Paul's iPad -- it's gone.

30:18.760 --> 30:20.190
Yeah!

30:22.440 --> 30:25.960
- Hey, Easy, what's up?
- Easy's dead, Theo.

30:27.280 --> 30:30.990
They're all dead except for you.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.800
We'll find you.

30:46.720 --> 30:50.830
Ezra Dennison and Errol Anderton,
who went by the names Easy and Wave,

30:50.880 --> 30:53.710
were found gunned down
yesterday in a relatives' home.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.750
It comes just days after

30:55.800 --> 31:00.590
17-year-old Meekaaeel Qureshi was
shot and killed riding his bicycle.

31:00.640 --> 31:03.150
Police say the shootings
appear to be targeted

31:03.200 --> 31:05.520
and are keen to reassure the public...

32:59.200 --> 33:00.760
Beautiful service.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.830
Was good of you to come.

33:04.880 --> 33:07.680
Like I told you, he was a friend of mine.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.430
Have they found the
bastards that did it yet?

33:12.480 --> 33:14.310
Did it?

33:14.360 --> 33:16.680
The shooting, the boys in the car.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.520
Three of them are dead.

33:22.720 --> 33:24.520
Well, there you go.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.110
You reap what you sow.

33:28.160 --> 33:30.790
Isn't that right, Clyde?

33:30.840 --> 33:32.720
You reap what you sow.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.160
If there's anything you need...

34:03.720 --> 34:05.070
- Hi.
- You all right?

34:05.120 --> 34:07.120
Yeah.

34:08.520 --> 34:12.630
- Helen, can I, erm, say
something, as a friend? - Mm-hm.

34:12.679 --> 34:15.230
If you ever need anything, please,

34:15.280 --> 34:18.310
for once in your life, just
pick up the bloody phone.

34:18.360 --> 34:23.230
OK, call me. I know how to change
a nappy, and believe it or not,

34:23.280 --> 34:26.710
I'm also extremely au fait
with the vagaries of Peppa Pig.

34:28.080 --> 34:29.270
Hiya.

34:29.320 --> 34:30.360
Helen.

34:32.280 --> 34:35.150
- You OK?
- How's the investigation going?

34:35.199 --> 34:38.429
- Well, I spoke with Carter, but
it can wait until... - Oh, no.

34:38.480 --> 34:39.750
This is his funeral.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.469
We are surrounded by coppers.

34:41.520 --> 34:44.760
- This is the perfect time.
- Gary, can you give us a minute?

34:46.520 --> 34:48.639
Yeah, yeah, course. Yeah.

34:53.800 --> 34:57.400
- I was going to come see you
tomorrow. - Mm-hmm. - After all this.

34:59.720 --> 35:02.470
They've had the crime scene report back.

35:02.520 --> 35:04.630
- There's a peculiarity.
- Peculiarity?

35:04.680 --> 35:09.430
Hm. So the collision
investigator was able to measure

35:09.480 --> 35:13.350
exactly how fast each car was
going when the incident occurred.

35:13.400 --> 35:17.350
- And the answer, oddly
enough, was not very. - So?

35:17.400 --> 35:20.550
The BMW was supposedly trying
to get away, at a time of night

35:20.600 --> 35:22.910
when there was very little
other traffic on the roads,

35:22.960 --> 35:25.630
but the only time it got up to
anything like a decent speed

35:25.680 --> 35:29.190
was after the shots were fired,
when it veered towards the bus stop.

35:29.240 --> 35:31.950
Well, you would speed up if
someone was shooting at you.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.310
No, this is the thing -- I told
you they dug two bullets out.

35:35.360 --> 35:40.110
- 30 eights. - Mm-hm. - But they
weren't in the right place. - Meaning?

35:40.160 --> 35:43.270
They got ballistics to map
the trajectory of the bullets

35:43.320 --> 35:45.790
based on the relative
heights of each vehicle.

35:45.840 --> 35:49.750
Look -- you can trace the
path each bullet took.

35:49.800 --> 35:52.440
Neither shot could have
originated from the car.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.550
Meaning what?

35:57.600 --> 35:59.830
That the shots were fired before.

35:59.880 --> 36:03.430
I don't know when exactly, but
certainly before the accident.

36:03.480 --> 36:06.950
Helen, they were fired by someone
standing outside the vehicle

36:07.000 --> 36:08.680
whilst it was stationary.

36:23.960 --> 36:26.550
- Brian. Hey.
- Helen!

36:26.600 --> 36:28.760
I need to check local intelligence.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.590
I'd been for a drink with a friend,

37:05.640 --> 37:10.480
and before you ask, it was one
drink and I wasn't over the limit.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.430
.. last about half an hour, cos I've
got to go somewhere at four o'clock,

37:20.480 --> 37:22.670
so if you just lay out some
copies of the report...

37:22.720 --> 37:24.870
I think there'll be about
six of them arriving...

37:24.920 --> 37:26.160
Hello, Sarah.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.030
Are you here for me?

37:31.080 --> 37:32.950
Well, I haven't come to make a donation.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.910
Er, can-can you just give me a minute?

37:34.960 --> 37:40.270
It's good work you do. It's worthy,
helping the less advantaged.

37:40.320 --> 37:41.990
Ironic, though, isn't it?

37:42.040 --> 37:44.950
Campaigning for pharmaceuticals
in Third World countries

37:45.000 --> 37:48.070
when the rest of the time you're
filling your own body with shit.

37:48.120 --> 37:49.670
I'm sorry, I don't know...

37:49.720 --> 37:53.830
Oh, bullshit. What is it? Coke? Crack?

37:53.880 --> 37:57.670
- I have no idea what you're on about.
- You must really owe them.

37:57.720 --> 38:02.310
They must have such a hold on
you to make you do what you did.

38:02.360 --> 38:05.630
Or were you just so off your...
off your head you couldn't think?

38:05.680 --> 38:07.310
I dunno what you're implying,

38:07.360 --> 38:10.800
but I strongly suggest that you
find some evidence to back...

38:12.640 --> 38:18.270
I buried him yesterday so don't
you dare give me that shit!

38:18.320 --> 38:20.190
Ow!

38:20.240 --> 38:24.230
I did some digging. There have been
incidents, haven't there, Sarah?

38:24.280 --> 38:26.270
Argh! Argh!

38:26.320 --> 38:28.150
Evidence of recreational drug use.

38:28.200 --> 38:30.750
Little stint at the Priory,
but I guess it didn't help.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.310
I guess you slipped on the recovery.

38:32.360 --> 38:34.710
I know the bullets were
fired before the crash,

38:34.760 --> 38:37.550
and I know that you're involved.

38:37.600 --> 38:40.360
He threatened to hurt my family.

38:42.120 --> 38:45.040
- Argh!
- What's going on here?

38:50.880 --> 38:53.030
Who?

38:53.080 --> 38:56.110
He just showed me where -- he
told me to hit the bus stop.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.750
And you didn't ask why?

38:57.800 --> 38:59.790
Of course I asked.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.270
He said he needed...

39:02.320 --> 39:03.990
he needed to cause a distraction,

39:04.040 --> 39:09.910
that night, in that area. I didn't
know anyone was going to be killed.

39:09.960 --> 39:12.950
I didn't. I swear.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.630
Who?

39:14.680 --> 39:17.190
I was going to lose everything.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.830
You don't know of the threats.

39:19.880 --> 39:22.680
Oh, God, I had to do it!

39:23.880 --> 39:25.190
I had to!

39:25.240 --> 39:27.560
Who? Who made you do it?

39:28.720 --> 39:30.830
Who organised all this, Sarah? Who?

39:30.880 --> 39:34.840
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

39:36.560 --> 39:39.000
I wish you'd broken your neck.

40:14.680 --> 40:15.720
Helen.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.200
Lovely surprise.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.150
How're you coping?

40:21.200 --> 40:23.230
It's after the funeral
that it really hits home.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.230
This is the tough time.

40:25.280 --> 40:28.880
At the funeral, you said,
"You reap what you sow."

40:29.880 --> 40:32.110
What did you mean by that?

40:32.160 --> 40:34.230
Turn of phrase. Like karma, isn't it?

40:34.280 --> 40:36.670
What goes around comes around.

40:36.720 --> 40:38.550
The driver of the car that killed Paul,

40:38.600 --> 40:41.110
she said someone arranged Paul's death.

40:41.160 --> 40:43.040
- Like who?
- Well, she didn't say.

40:45.040 --> 40:48.000
There's something I haven't
told you -- about Paul...

40:49.880 --> 40:51.470
.. and my daughter, Laura.

40:51.520 --> 40:55.110
They were an item, lovers.

40:55.160 --> 40:56.200
Before you.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.160
He was good to her.

41:01.280 --> 41:02.750
What happened?

41:02.800 --> 41:04.120
She was killed.

41:05.560 --> 41:07.350
It tore my heart out.

41:07.400 --> 41:10.280
Did Paul never tell you about Laura dying?

41:12.240 --> 41:14.120
No.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.720
Things had been different,
he'd've been my son-in-law.

41:40.640 --> 41:43.510
You should talk to a
guy called Jacky Snooks

41:43.560 --> 41:46.550
at the social centre
in the Newyard Estate...

41:46.600 --> 41:49.790
about a meeting that took
place there a few weeks ago

41:49.840 --> 41:51.920
with those lads who got shot.

42:02.360 --> 42:03.760
Are you Jacky Snooks?

42:04.800 --> 42:08.030
My name is Helen Weeks. I'm a detective.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.670
I could flash you my warrant card
but I don't want to do that here.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.710
I just want to ask you some questions,

42:12.760 --> 42:15.660
about the killings that have
been going on, the young boys.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.710
There's a mural to one of them
down the road, Meekaaeel Qureshi.

42:20.760 --> 42:22.110
Did you know them?

42:22.160 --> 42:25.270
These-these people, they're...
they're not my friends.

42:25.320 --> 42:28.350
I didn't ask if they were your
friends. I asked did you know them?

42:28.400 --> 42:32.400
Three boys -- BOYS -- have been murdered.

42:34.840 --> 42:36.990
Did they have meetings here?

42:37.040 --> 42:38.790
Did they do business?

42:38.840 --> 42:43.390
I let them play pool, dominoes.

42:43.440 --> 42:47.120
How am I supposed to
know what people discuss?

42:49.560 --> 42:51.280
Please, Jacky.

42:53.360 --> 42:56.550
All right, I can't tell you anything.

42:56.600 --> 43:02.720
When I close my eyes, when I open
them, just look where I'm looking.

43:12.160 --> 43:14.950
- Bob Marley?
- Mm -- the man, the one and only.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.510
- And? - Bob Marley, him see everything.

43:18.560 --> 43:22.710
But people don't know we
film, so they feel safe.

43:22.760 --> 43:24.550
How long do you keep the footage?

43:24.600 --> 43:27.760
I need to be looking at
Thursday two weeks ago.

43:30.800 --> 43:34.680
I have no idea. You going to
have to ask the manager that.

43:39.840 --> 43:42.390
September 15th.

43:42.440 --> 43:44.790
Use my computer if you like.

43:44.840 --> 43:48.630
We, er, strive to ensure nothing
criminal happens in the club.

43:48.680 --> 43:52.550
- You realise that, don't you? Brew?
- Ah, yeah, yeah.

43:52.600 --> 43:54.640
- Tea, tea would be lovely.
- No problem.

43:58.640 --> 44:00.150
You're looking pretty large there.

44:00.200 --> 44:02.760
- When are you due?
- Today. Any second.

44:03.760 --> 44:06.390
But don't worry -- only 4% of
births come on their due date

44:06.440 --> 44:07.760
so we'll be fine.

45:03.920 --> 45:06.390
- Get Gosforth!
- Helen?

45:06.440 --> 45:07.600
Get Gosforth!

45:10.320 --> 45:11.800
Bastard!

45:17.840 --> 45:19.310
- Helen, get off!
- Helen!

45:19.360 --> 45:20.750
- What the fuck?
- You killed him!

45:20.800 --> 45:23.360
- Get off me! Get off me!
- Get off him!

45:25.800 --> 45:27.640
The fuck?!

45:37.440 --> 45:39.120
Fucking...

45:44.000 --> 45:47.200
With Sarah's confession, he'll get life.

45:53.520 --> 45:55.470
Adam must've known.

45:55.520 --> 45:57.070
He must've known that Paul

45:57.120 --> 45:59.320
was working for a counter corruption unit.

46:01.320 --> 46:03.800
Must've realised that Paul was onto him.

46:04.800 --> 46:08.030
I'll tell you what I
don't understand, is why,

46:08.080 --> 46:10.030
knowing what he knew about Adam,

46:10.080 --> 46:12.880
Paul didn't report this to his superiors.

46:19.400 --> 46:22.440
I, er... I had a thing...

46:24.360 --> 46:28.120
I had a fling -- with Adam.

46:31.320 --> 46:32.910
Paul knew.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.190
It was over.

46:34.240 --> 46:37.720
So if he'd disclosed that,
he'd've been taken off the case.

46:40.080 --> 46:42.280
I've slept with Adam since.

46:43.920 --> 46:45.720
How?

46:46.920 --> 46:48.470
How could he do that?

46:48.520 --> 46:53.710
- Helen, Helen. - No, but how,
how, how, how could he? Hm.

46:53.760 --> 46:56.790
- He was trying to protect himself.
- By killing Paul?

46:56.840 --> 46:58.910
The whole operation was
going to be exposed --

46:58.960 --> 47:00.480
Sherwood, Adam.

47:02.160 --> 47:03.430
Adam was in his pocket --

47:03.480 --> 47:06.390
Sherwood worked it out,
tipped him off, that's it.

47:06.440 --> 47:09.950
Adam used his drug connections
to make it look like

47:10.000 --> 47:13.160
the gang caused an accident,
blackmailed Sarah Rushton...

47:15.800 --> 47:18.230
Clever bastard.

47:18.280 --> 47:20.000
Threw us all off the scent.

47:24.320 --> 47:29.310
What... What I don't get is how?

47:29.360 --> 47:30.710
How did he know?

47:30.760 --> 47:32.910
How did he know that Paul
would be there that night,

47:32.960 --> 47:34.400
at that bus stop?

47:35.560 --> 47:38.310
Well, it's just a thought,
but maybe he was with him.

47:38.360 --> 47:41.310
Remember the witness evidence?

47:41.360 --> 47:44.670
Saying that Paul spoke to another
man? We never traced him.

47:44.720 --> 47:46.920
Adam lured Paul out under a pretext.

47:48.080 --> 47:49.480
What do you mean?

47:51.040 --> 47:52.560
The baby.

47:59.920 --> 48:01.790
So we understand each other, yeah?

48:01.840 --> 48:03.160
Yeah, we're good.

48:04.760 --> 48:06.920
You need some time to work things out.

48:08.680 --> 48:10.480
Listen, I need a piss.

48:24.400 --> 48:26.750
I made it so easy for Adam.

48:26.800 --> 48:29.760
- Helen, you can't think like that.
- Oh, no, I gave him a way in.

48:32.200 --> 48:34.830
Listen, I'll get someone
to drive you home.

48:34.880 --> 48:36.270
- No, I'm fine.
- Helen!

48:36.320 --> 48:39.390
Right, so, if Adam was
in the pay of Sherwood,

48:39.440 --> 48:42.830
then he'd hired Easy and those
other boys to assist him,

48:42.880 --> 48:44.710
don't you think that it's a coincidence

48:44.760 --> 48:46.400
that they all have ended up dead?

48:47.400 --> 48:48.520
They're not all dead.

48:50.520 --> 48:53.150
Three of them are dead, one's missing.

48:53.200 --> 48:56.150
- Presumed dead. - And the other
is alive and well as far as we know.

48:56.200 --> 48:59.510
- The other, what? - Sarah said
there were five lads in the car.

48:59.560 --> 49:01.550
Right.

49:01.600 --> 49:06.230
So you don't think that anyone's
been trying to kill them off?

49:06.280 --> 49:08.840
Who -- Adam?

49:10.920 --> 49:14.000
Helen, go home -- rest.
We'll take things from here.

49:18.440 --> 49:19.630
Yo, Tee.

49:19.680 --> 49:22.310
- Theo! - Just one sec,
Wave. - Come on, man!

49:22.360 --> 49:23.880
Hurry up, man!

49:38.120 --> 49:40.950
Hiya. Do you remember me?

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
I'm, er, I'm the MILF from the other day.

49:45.280 --> 49:49.400
Look, I'm looking for a...
for a kid called Theo -- T.

49:50.600 --> 49:52.910
Please, it's urgent. Do
you know where he lives?

49:52.960 --> 49:54.280
What's so urgent?

49:56.400 --> 49:58.960
- What do you think?
- Theo's the man?

50:03.520 --> 50:05.670
Please, just...

50:05.720 --> 50:08.840
Down there -- end house.

50:13.200 --> 50:15.190
Hiya. Is Theo inside?

50:15.240 --> 50:18.230
- He lives over there. Across the way.
- That one there?

50:18.280 --> 50:20.550
- Yeah, one on the end.
- Right, thank you.

50:20.600 --> 50:22.040
Yo, Theo!

50:23.800 --> 50:25.840
Lady here wants to speak to Theo.

50:28.960 --> 50:31.070
- Theo? - You can't come in.
We're just about to leave...

50:31.120 --> 50:32.750
It's all right, it's OK. Theo?

50:32.800 --> 50:35.400
- Theo!
- Get out of my house!

50:38.160 --> 50:39.560
Javine, get back.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.790
I'm a police officer.

50:47.840 --> 50:50.470
My partner died a few weeks ago.

50:50.520 --> 50:52.000
He was standing at a bus stop.

50:53.320 --> 50:56.670
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

50:56.720 --> 50:58.430
I shot to miss.

50:58.480 --> 51:00.200
No-one was supposed to die.

51:01.360 --> 51:03.230
- I swear.
- I know.

51:03.280 --> 51:05.750
There were blanks in that gun.

51:05.800 --> 51:09.720
The woman in the car, she drove
at the bus stop on purpose.

51:11.200 --> 51:13.600
She was in on the whole thing.

51:15.240 --> 51:19.640
It was made to look like it was
an accident, like it was random.

51:30.360 --> 51:31.760
You're in such danger, Theo.

51:33.320 --> 51:35.910
Wherever you run to, they will find you.

51:35.960 --> 51:39.600
Trust me, they killed all the
others, they will find you...

51:41.120 --> 51:44.160
.. but if you help me, help us...

51:51.560 --> 51:53.080
Come on.

52:02.520 --> 52:04.320
I'm so sorry.

52:09.840 --> 52:11.040
Oh.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.520
Shit!

52:15.960 --> 52:17.600
Your waters!

52:18.920 --> 52:20.110
Ah.

52:20.160 --> 52:22.590
The bathroom's through there.
Come on, I'll get you a towel.

52:22.640 --> 52:25.590
No, er... No, er, if, er, if you...

52:25.640 --> 52:27.390
if you could call me a taxi, that'd be...

52:27.440 --> 52:30.310
Taxi? Round here? you'll be lucky!

52:30.360 --> 52:31.590
Can one of you drive?

52:31.640 --> 52:34.950
Right, Javine, right go to your
mum's and I'll meet you back there.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.470
- I'll take her, right?
I'll take you. - Yeah.

52:37.520 --> 52:39.040
- All right?
- Yeah.

52:48.400 --> 52:51.350
Do you know who killed them
-- Wave and the others?

52:51.400 --> 52:53.310
- I've got a fair idea.
- What -- is it a secret?

52:53.360 --> 52:55.590
Ah, shit!

52:55.640 --> 52:57.640
Oh!

53:01.000 --> 53:02.790
It's OK.

53:02.840 --> 53:05.000
Just... just breathe.

53:10.440 --> 53:11.990
Where are you running to?

53:12.040 --> 53:14.070
Lake District.

53:14.120 --> 53:16.310
We'll find work.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.830
Javine's mum gave us some money.

53:18.880 --> 53:21.910
Theo, with what you know about
what happened in the gang,

53:21.960 --> 53:24.030
you can convict the
bastard who did all this,

53:24.080 --> 53:26.350
the ones who are responsible
for killing your friends.

53:26.400 --> 53:30.590
Thing is, if I make a
statement, I'm as good as dead.

53:30.640 --> 53:32.990
We can protect you!

53:33.040 --> 53:35.160
This is why I tracked you down.

53:48.640 --> 53:51.240
- All right?
- Yeah.

53:52.480 --> 53:55.230
There's a lady having
a baby, she needs help!

53:55.280 --> 53:58.000
There's a lady having
a baby, she needs help!

53:59.040 --> 54:00.430
Right, good luck.

54:00.480 --> 54:03.750
Get yourself to the police station
and you ask for DCI Gosforth

54:03.800 --> 54:07.240
and you tell him that I sent
you. Please, Theo. Please.
