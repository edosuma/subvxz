03:11.257 --> 03:13.509
But at least
be honest about the facts.

That's what I’m saying.
Who's honest?

03:16.262 --> 03:17.263
I'm honest.
Uh-huh.

03:17.763 --> 03:19.730
I am honest about
what I write about.

03:19.765 --> 03:21.267
I... I’ll let you know
if it's autobiographical,

03:21.302 --> 03:23.286
or if it's about me,
or if it's not.

03:23.321 --> 03:25.236
And I find
autobiographical stories

03:25.271 --> 03:27.273

to be quite boring.

to who you are is important.

I'm not saying you need to
be psychoanalytical
about the whole mess.

03:40.071 --> 03:42.038

Yeah, I...
but don't be afraid.

the plot of his new book.

And he said to me,
"but I just want to make sure

03:54.585 --> 03:57.053
it's not one of those
problem novels."

03:57.088 --> 03:58.519
And I said, "Jimmy,

03:58.554 --> 04:02.058

a problem?"

and he laughed
because he knew I was right.

04:11.602 --> 04:14.570
I'm saying, you know,
if you're gonna write
something like that,

04:14.605 --> 04:16.572
at least be honest
why you're writing it.

04:17.072 --> 04:19.040
Can't we just be honest?

04:19.075 --> 04:21.077
Well, I don't think
you actually
need to be honest.

some white man from the south

about a black man

is an issue!

um, a better picture
of what happened.

17:18.221 --> 17:19.186
Oh...

17:19.688 --> 17:20.939
what is this?

happened to him before."

18:15.994 --> 18:17.461
how did that happen?

18:17.496 --> 18:21.500
Apparently
detective Foxy's wife,
uh, has read fiction.

18:23.001 --> 18:24.002
That's great.

18:24.503 --> 18:25.504

19:10.083 --> 19:11.049
Mama would've put in
half the bottle.

19:11.550 --> 19:13.301
She had to buy it
by the crate.

Alvin's gonna hate this.

19:15.088 --> 19:16.555

Oh, I cannot believe
you're from New Orleans.

Well, I only lived there
for a short while,

19:25.015 --> 19:26.982
but my mama
was born and bred.

19:28.984 --> 19:30.951
You know something?

19:30.986 --> 19:32.988
Alvin pretends
he doesn't know who you are,

19:33.023 --> 19:34.990

you came to town,

19:35.025 --> 19:36.456
he read your books.
No!

19:36.491 --> 19:39.995
He had one of his men pick up

this job to spite you?"

19:53.043 --> 19:55.475

19:55.510 --> 20:00.515
I was writing the script
as they were filming,
all that time in Italy

20:00.550 --> 20:02.482
and I’d work like mad
all day long

20:02.517 --> 20:05.520
and then dash down to the ba
around midnight

I’d only just handed them
the final scene

20:27.277 --> 20:29.494
when the bellhop told
me I had a phone call.

20:30.996 --> 20:33.748
And it was my stepfather,
Joe Capote,

20:33.783 --> 20:36.501
calling to say
that my mother had died.

20:38.003 --> 20:42.007
I... I flew home to New York,
terribly distraught...

20:43.508 --> 20:45.510
but when I got
to the apartment,

20:46.011 --> 20:50.515
I could see
that Joe was in even
worse shape than I was.

20:50.550 --> 20:53.518
He grabbed my hand
and he said to me,

20:54.519 --> 20:55.520
"talk.

were good friends from church.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.569
Oh, come on, Alvin.
These are good people.

22:13.598 --> 22:17.602
Why would they put a pillow
under the boy's head
just to shoot him?

Why would they tuck Nancy in?

would love to meet you.

33:02.246 --> 33:04.248
Do you still need some?

33:08.753 --> 33:10.254
Give me your hand.

33:25.269 --> 33:27.772
I could kill you
if you got too close.

33:41.786 --> 33:43.788
Now, would you
like some water,
or...

33:53.798 --> 33:55.800
Mrs. Sanderson
lent you my book.

34:05.810 --> 34:08.813
He said we'd curry
favor with the judge

34:09.813 --> 34:11.815
if we waived our rights.

34:12.817 --> 34:13.818
Who did?

34:14.819 --> 34:16.320
The lawyer.

34:26.130 --> 34:27.630
[Clicking tongue]

34:29.632 --> 34:32.136
Your picture's undignified.

34:33.137 --> 34:35.639
People recall
first impressions.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.141
Oh,

34:37.641 --> 34:40.143
what's been your
first impression?

34:46.150 --> 34:47.650
[Phone ringing]

34:48.652 --> 34:49.652
Hello.

34:50.154 --> 34:51.630
Mr. Shawn.
Truman.

34:51.665 --> 34:53.072
I'm writing a book.

34:53.107 --> 34:55.109
It... it's too much
for a single article.

34:55.609 --> 34:58.362
This town, the...
the killers most of all.

34:58.397 --> 35:01.115
Uh, you will be stunned
by Perry Smith.

35:01.150 --> 35:02.581
Why, what's happening?

35:02.616 --> 35:04.618
Well, not much yet,
but I know.

35:04.653 --> 35:06.385
I... I can sense him.

35:06.420 --> 35:09.423
He... he's desperately lonely,
uh, frightened.

35:09.924 --> 35:10.925
[Stammering]
I have a question.

35:11.425 --> 35:12.426
Are you ready?

35:12.927 --> 35:13.928
Would it matter?

35:13.963 --> 35:14.894
Uh, no.

35:14.929 --> 35:16.931
[Both laughing]

35:17.431 --> 35:18.898
How much more money
can you send me?

35:18.933 --> 35:20.935
And... and how quickly
could you get Dick Avedon

35:21.435 --> 35:22.937
out here to take
some pictures?

35:25.806 --> 35:27.691
[Clicking]

35:28.692 --> 35:31.195
Who are you smiling at
right now?

35:31.230 --> 35:33.162
I'm smilin' at you.

35:33.197 --> 35:36.200
You know,
Dick's a very famous
fashion photographer.

35:37.201 --> 35:38.702
World-famous.

35:40.704 --> 35:42.206
(Richard)
Am I gonna be
in a fashion magazine?

35:42.706 --> 35:43.707
[Chuckles]

35:44.208 --> 35:46.710
So there's no worry
of having a bad picture.

35:47.711 --> 35:48.962
[All chuckle]

35:48.997 --> 35:50.214
[Clears throat]

35:51.715 --> 35:54.218
Who were you closer to,
your mom or your dad?

35:54.253 --> 35:56.220
What's that?
Who were you closer to,

35:56.255 --> 35:57.221
your mom or your dad?

35:57.256 --> 35:58.489
Well, both.

35:58.524 --> 35:59.723
Yeah?
Yeah.

36:00.724 --> 36:01.725
Have you talked to them?

36:01.760 --> 36:02.726
(Richard)
Yeah.

36:03.227 --> 36:05.229
Who'd you talk to first?

36:05.264 --> 36:06.230
[Chuckling]

36:07.231 --> 36:09.233
[Camera clicking]

36:10.734 --> 36:13.237
Perry, honey,
you look terrific, baby.

36:16.740 --> 36:18.707
That was good.

36:18.742 --> 36:21.245
Can you show us the tattoo
on your chest then?

36:21.745 --> 36:22.746
Yeah.

36:24.248 --> 36:25.249

36:27.751 --> 36:28.752

[Camera clicking]

36:52.776 --> 36:55.029
[Crowd murmuring]

37:10.544 --> 37:12.546
Where did Perry
get the art set?

37:15.916 --> 37:18.919
(judge Tate)
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

37:21.422 --> 37:22.423
Yes, sir.

37:23.424 --> 37:25.225
Defendants, rise.

37:29.730 --> 37:33.198
Perry Edward Smith
and Richard Eugene Hickock,

37:33.233 --> 37:38.739
you stand accused
of 4 counts of the crime
of murder in the first degree.

37:38.774 --> 37:40.741
Have you reached
a unanimous verdict?

37:41.241 --> 37:42.742
(foreman)
We have, your honor.

37:42.777 --> 37:44.244
(judge Tate)
What is your verdict?

37:44.745 --> 37:46.747
Guilty on all 4 counts.

37:52.870 --> 37:55.372
Have you unanimously
reached a sentence?

37:57.374 --> 37:59.126
(foreman)
We have, your honor.

37:59.161 --> 38:00.878
(judge Tate)
What is the sentence?

38:01.879 --> 38:03.345
Death.

38:03.380 --> 38:05.215
[Camera flashes popping]

38:20.731 --> 38:23.233
I need to see him
before we go.

38:27.738 --> 38:29.740
Perry.

38:30.240 --> 38:33.744
They're going to transfer you
up to lansing today.

38:34.244 --> 38:37.748
And you'll have to make sure
to put me
on the visitors list.

38:38.749 --> 38:40.751
Otherwise I can't see you.

38:42.753 --> 38:46.256
I'm going to help
find you a proper lawyer.

38:50.260 --> 38:54.264
You need a serious lawyer
for an appeal.

38:56.183 --> 38:57.649
[Train horn blowing]

38:57.684 --> 39:01.153
(Capote)
Now they took Dick last night.

39:01.188 --> 39:04.691
And I need you to get him
to do the same thing

39:04.726 --> 39:07.194
and just put me
on the visitors list.

39:10.531 --> 39:12.332
[Train rumbling]

39:22.843 --> 39:24.845
[Jazz music playing]

39:31.852 --> 39:35.320
[Chattering]

39:35.355 --> 39:37.858
[Stuttering]
And I thought,
"where does the family eat?"

39:37.893 --> 39:39.324
You know?

39:39.359 --> 39:41.361
I mean, does he,
like, reach his hand
through the bars

39:41.396 --> 39:43.864
and have dinner with everyone
around the table?

39:44.364 --> 39:48.869
Nelle, kudos on, um...
kill the bird, is it?

39:48.904 --> 39:50.335
That's... that's close.
Thank you.

39:50.370 --> 39:52.372
That's marvelous.
Who's your publisher?

39:52.407 --> 39:53.338
Lippincott.

39:53.373 --> 39:55.340
Yes. It's a children's book
right?

39:55.375 --> 39:56.877
Yes.
No, no. It's...
it's about children.

39:56.912 --> 39:58.378
Yes.
Yes, I’ve heard
a lot about it.

39:58.879 --> 39:59.845
Good.
Congratulations.

39:59.880 --> 40:01.381
Thank you.
I didn't even know
she wrote.

40:01.416 --> 40:03.383
He's sad and he's shy.

40:04.885 --> 40:06.351
And he's terrified.

40:06.386 --> 40:10.856
They shotgunned
the entire family
in the face.

40:10.891 --> 40:13.894
And I thought, at first,
"mmm, I’m gonna be
scared of these men.

40:14.394 --> 40:16.646
I'm gonna run,
run, run right home."

40:16.681 --> 40:18.899
Actually, the brother
in the family...

40:19.900 --> 40:22.903
Kenyon is his name,

40:23.403 --> 40:25.405
they had placed a pillow
under his head,

40:26.406 --> 40:29.659
and then shot him
point-blank in the face.

40:29.694 --> 40:32.913
Almost as if they were
putting him to sleep

40:32.948 --> 40:34.414
and then shot him.

40:37.417 --> 40:40.420
This is the start of
a great love affair.

40:40.455 --> 40:43.388
Yeah. Truman
in love with Truman.

40:43.423 --> 40:46.927
The book I’m writing
will return him
to the realm of humanity.

40:47.928 --> 40:50.430
It's the book I was
always meant to write.

40:53.433 --> 40:57.187
Well, he hasn't actually
written a word of it yet,

40:57.222 --> 41:00.941
but he says
it's the nonfiction book
of the decade,

41:00.976 --> 41:02.442
so...

41:03.944 --> 41:04.945
so...

41:06.446 --> 41:08.448
what have you been doing?

41:08.483 --> 41:10.450
[All laughing]

41:12.452 --> 41:14.454
And I’ll tell you,

41:14.955 --> 41:18.959
I was in Marilyn’s
apartment just last week,
talking about movies, art.

41:18.994 --> 41:21.228
Finally I had to
break it to her that

41:21.263 --> 41:23.463
of the 4 matisses
hanging on her wall,

41:23.498 --> 41:25.465
2 were upside down.

41:25.500 --> 41:26.466
[Chuckling]

41:27.467 --> 41:29.935
Can I have another, please?

41:29.970 --> 41:32.973
To answer your question,
I’m following
breakfast at tiffany's

41:33.473 --> 41:35.440
by blazing a different path.

41:35.475 --> 41:38.979
By inventing an entirely
new kind of writing.

41:39.479 --> 41:40.981
The nonfiction novel.

41:41.481 --> 41:43.233
You have a subject?
Yes.

41:43.268 --> 41:44.950
On the night of November 14,

41:44.985 --> 41:47.487
2 men broke into
a quiet farmhouse in Kansas

41:47.988 --> 41:50.240
and murdered an entire family.

41:50.275 --> 41:52.457
Now, why did they do that?

41:52.492 --> 41:54.995
2 worlds exist
in this country.

41:55.495 --> 41:59.499
The quiet, conservative life,
and the life of those 2 men.

41:59.534 --> 42:02.502
The underbelly.
The criminally violent.

42:03.003 --> 42:06.006
And those worlds converged
that bloody night.

42:06.506 --> 42:07.973
Now, I spent the past 3 months

42:08.008 --> 42:11.011
interviewing
everyone in Kansas
touched by that violence.

42:11.511 --> 42:13.513
Now I spent hours
talking to the killers

42:13.548 --> 42:15.480
and I’ll spend more.

42:15.515 --> 42:18.984
'Cause researching this work
has changed my life.

42:19.019 --> 42:22.522
You know,
it's altered my point of view
about almost everything.

42:23.523 --> 42:24.990
Yeah.

42:25.025 --> 42:28.528
And I think those who read it
will be similarly affected.

42:48.548 --> 42:50.515
So you find them
a new lawyer.

42:50.550 --> 42:55.020
Well, they're facing
execution in 6 weeks.

42:55.055 --> 42:59.059
You know, they need
someone to argue
whether or not that's right.

43:00.060 --> 43:01.561
[Birds chirping]

43:02.062 --> 43:02.562
[Kids chattering]

43:03.563 --> 43:04.529
Ok.

43:04.564 --> 43:07.067
[Stuttering]
And I’d also like to
see them alive.

43:08.068 --> 43:10.035
Weli...
yeah.

43:10.070 --> 43:12.572
Yeah, I need to
hear their stories.

43:12.607 --> 43:14.539
[Jack clears throat]

43:14.574 --> 43:17.577
Well, just be careful
what you do to
get what you want.

43:17.612 --> 43:19.044
[Sighing]
I...

43:19.079 --> 43:22.047
I’m finding them a lawyer.

43:22.082 --> 43:23.583
Truman, you're
finding yourself a lawyer.

43:23.618 --> 43:25.585
No, I’m finding them
a lawyer.

43:28.088 --> 43:29.589
There's a difference.

43:53.313 --> 43:54.815
[Door opening]

43:55.315 --> 43:57.117
The Warden will see you now.

44:01.121 --> 44:03.123
Well, we do all right
by our boys.
Hmm.

44:03.623 --> 44:06.091
Showers once a week.
Feed them good.

44:06.126 --> 44:09.629
We'll be feeding Perry Smith
in the infirmary soon
if he don't eat.

44:10.130 --> 44:11.881
Try and get the food in
through his arm.

44:11.916 --> 44:13.633
I'm sorry,
what are you talking about?

44:13.668 --> 44:16.153
Well,
he hasn't eaten in a month.

44:16.188 --> 44:18.638
It ain't his right
to kill himself.

44:18.673 --> 44:20.407
It's the right of the people.

44:20.442 --> 44:22.107
The people of this state.

44:22.142 --> 44:24.144
And that's who I work for,
the people.

44:25.145 --> 44:26.146
No one told me.

44:26.646 --> 44:27.647
Yeah, he won't eat.

44:30.150 --> 44:31.151
Uh-huh.

44:32.152 --> 44:33.403
When can I see him?

44:33.438 --> 44:34.654
Well, let me see.

44:38.158 --> 44:41.161
How about you coming 3:00,
Thursday afternoon?

44:41.196 --> 44:42.162
No.

44:42.662 --> 44:44.129
Um...

44:44.164 --> 44:45.665
that's no good.

44:45.700 --> 44:47.132
I...

44:47.167 --> 44:49.634
I need to see them now.

44:49.669 --> 44:53.638
Then... then whenever I want,
for as long as I want.

44:53.673 --> 44:57.677
Well, that's just not
how we do things
around here, Mr. Capote.

44:59.679 --> 45:02.147
Yeah, I understand
what a burden

45:02.182 --> 45:05.685
unlimited visitation might be
on this institution

45:06.186 --> 45:09.189
and on the people
who pay for it.

45:09.224 --> 45:11.156
And I want to be clear

45:11.191 --> 45:14.194
that I don't expect
the citizens
of Leavenworth county

45:14.694 --> 45:16.696
to have to
shoulder that burden.

45:23.203 --> 45:25.705
This is to be dispensed
as you see fit.

45:39.219 --> 45:42.222
You know, I didn't know
where to count your boy
at first,

45:42.257 --> 45:44.224
him being half-Indian.

45:44.724 --> 45:46.191
But I did him a favor.

45:46.226 --> 45:47.727
I counted him as a white man.

45:49.729 --> 45:52.732
Uh-huh. You're a kind
and generous man.

45:52.767 --> 45:54.234
Spread your feet.

46:02.742 --> 46:04.244
This way.

Hey,
thanks a lot for your help
with the lawyer.

46:22.797 --> 46:24.264
Oh, that's fine.

46:26.766 --> 46:30.270
Wow, you must be
really desperate for a story
to come all the way out here.

46:34.274 --> 46:36.776
You want to go
see Perry, go ahead.

46:37.277 --> 46:38.743
Thank you.

46:38.778 --> 46:40.612
You want my advice,
though, Mr. Capote,

46:40.647 --> 46:43.650
he's just trying to prove
the insanity defense.

47:18.518 --> 47:20.020
[Boy clicking gun]

47:27.527 --> 47:28.528
It's ok.

47:44.044 --> 47:45.045
It's ok.

47:46.546 --> 47:50.050
It's Truman.
It's your friend.

47:54.554 --> 47:55.555
It's ok.

48:10.570 --> 48:12.572
[Sighing]

49:39.292 --> 49:41.544
This is before she had us.

49:41.579 --> 49:43.797
Before she started drinking.

49:45.298 --> 49:47.801
Who took care of you
as a child?

49:49.803 --> 49:50.804
Orphanage.

49:52.305 --> 49:53.807
Me and Linda.

49:54.307 --> 49:55.809
And that's your sister?

50:06.319 --> 50:10.323
You know,
we're not so different
as you might think.

50:10.358 --> 50:14.327
Yeah, I was abandoned
repeatedly as a child.

50:20.333 --> 50:24.587
My mama would drag me along
to some new town,

with another man she'd met.

she'd lock me
in the hotel room alone.

and tell the staff

50:36.384 --> 50:38.351

no matter what.

50:47.360 --> 50:50.363

50:53.867 --> 50:56.835

50:56.870 --> 51:01.374
on the carpet
next to the door
and I’d fall asleep.

51:04.377 --> 51:06.880

51:06.915 --> 51:08.847

a good thing for her.

01:05:30.110 --> 01:05:33.078
'by fracture of
the cervical vertebrae,

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:36.330
'by laceration
of the trachea.'

01:05:36.365 --> 01:05:39.284
"Not too comforting,
as we lost our appeal.

01:05:40.285 --> 01:05:41.787
"Missing you.

01:05:42.287 --> 01:05:44.673
"Alone and desirous
of your presence.

01:05:46.675 --> 01:05:49.143
Your amigo, Perry."

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:52.181
Mr. Shawn told me
about the court
decision yesterday.

01:05:53.682 --> 01:05:56.185
I was wondering why you were
in such a good mood.

01:05:57.553 --> 01:05:59.555
That's
a terrible thing to say.

01:06:01.056 --> 01:06:04.059
I... I write him all the time
I’ve just...

01:06:04.094 --> 01:06:07.062
I’ve been so focused on-
- on the book lately.

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:26.296
So Jack thinks
I’m using Perry,

01:06:26.331 --> 01:06:30.836
but he also thinks
I fell in love with him
when I was in Kansas.

01:06:30.871 --> 01:06:34.339
Now, how both of those things
can be true is beyond me.

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:36.341
Thank you.

01:06:39.845 --> 01:06:42.347
Well, did you?

01:06:42.848 --> 01:06:44.349
Did you fall in love
with him?

01:06:46.852 --> 01:06:48.353
I don't know
how to answer that.

01:06:48.388 --> 01:06:49.855
Truman.

01:06:52.858 --> 01:06:56.361
It's as if
Perry and I grew up
in the same house,

01:06:58.864 --> 01:07:02.367
and one day he stood up
and went out the back door

01:07:03.368 --> 01:07:05.370
while I went out the front.

01:07:07.372 --> 01:07:08.874
Are you kidding me?

01:07:08.909 --> 01:07:09.875
No.

01:07:13.879 --> 01:07:16.381
Listen, you be nice to Jack.

01:07:16.882 --> 01:07:19.384
Sometimes I think
he's what I like
about you best.

01:07:20.385 --> 01:07:22.888
I'll see you
at the reading in New York.

01:07:26.391 --> 01:07:27.357
16th.

01:07:27.392 --> 01:07:28.859
(Capote)
16th.

01:07:28.894 --> 01:07:30.896
[Car engine starting]
Adios.

01:07:48.464 --> 01:07:50.931
(Perry)
What was he in jail for?

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:54.970
Well, they said it was
for not paying his taxes,

01:07:55.005 --> 01:07:57.473
but really,
for being an outsider.

01:07:58.974 --> 01:08:01.442
Refusing to go along.

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:02.978
(guard #1)
Lowell, you're being moved.

01:08:03.013 --> 01:08:03.979
(Lowell)
Why?

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.482
You're going to
final holding.
No.

01:08:07.483 --> 01:08:09.485
Come on, Lowell.
Open the door.

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:17.457
(guard #1)
Stand up.

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:18.993
Put your arms
behind your back.

01:08:19.029 --> 01:08:20.496
(guard #2)
Ok, last chance.

01:08:20.531 --> 01:08:21.997
Well, get up.
Ah!

01:08:22.032 --> 01:08:22.962
Turn around.

01:08:22.997 --> 01:08:25.000
Put your arms
behind your back.

01:08:43.018 --> 01:08:45.520
Now Dick and me,
we're next in line.

01:08:50.024 --> 01:08:53.028
I'm so sorry I’ve been away.

01:08:56.532 --> 01:08:58.033
It was a long time.

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:01.537
I know.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.542
How's the book coming along?

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:11.046
Oh, very slowly.

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:15.515
Will you show it to me?

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:18.053
I've hardly written anything.

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:20.055
[Clanking]

01:09:43.578 --> 01:09:47.082
(William)
Good evening, New Yorkers,

01:09:47.165 --> 01:09:51.169
and thank you for coming
to the first public reading,

01:09:51.203 --> 01:09:53.671
the first offering
of any kind,

01:09:54.171 --> 01:09:57.175
of Truman Capote's new work,
in cold blood.

01:09:57.210 --> 01:10:00.679
[Applause]

01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:13.692
Hello.
My name is Truman Capote.

01:10:14.192 --> 01:10:15.659
[Chuckling]

01:10:15.694 --> 01:10:17.946
For this...
for this evening's program,

01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:20.591
I’m going to read, uh,
some passages

01:10:20.626 --> 01:10:23.201
from the first 3 parts
of my new book.

01:10:29.708 --> 01:10:30.709
"The village of Holcomb

01:10:31.209 --> 01:10:34.712
"stands on
the high wheat plains
of western Kansas,

01:10:34.747 --> 01:10:38.216
"a lonesome area
that other Kansans
call 'out there.'

01:10:39.718 --> 01:10:43.186
"Until one morning
in mid-November, 1959,

01:10:43.221 --> 01:10:48.226
"few Americans,
in fact, few Kansans,
had ever heard of Holcomb.

01:10:48.261 --> 01:10:50.729
"Like the waters
of the Arkansas river,

01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:53.231
"like the motorists
on the highway,

01:10:53.732 --> 01:10:56.234
"exceptional happenings
never stopped there.

01:11:09.247 --> 01:11:12.250
"Perry Smith's voice
was both gentle and prim.

01:11:13.251 --> 01:11:14.753
"A voice that, though soft,

01:11:15.253 --> 01:11:18.722
"manufactured
each sound exactly,

01:11:18.757 --> 01:11:23.261
"ejected it like a smoke ring
issuing from
a parson's mouth.

[Clanking]

01:11:29.267 --> 01:11:31.519
"The 4 coffins,
which quite filled

01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:33.737
the small,
flower-crowded parlor

01:11:33.772 --> 01:11:36.274
"were to be sealed
at the funeral services,

01:11:37.275 --> 01:11:39.242
"very understandably,

01:11:39.277 --> 01:11:42.781
"for the effect
was disquieting.

01:11:44.282 --> 01:11:47.285
"Nancy wore her dress
of cherry-red velvet,

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.288
"her brother
a bright plaid shirt.

01:11:50.789 --> 01:11:53.256
"The parents
were more sedately attired,

01:11:53.291 --> 01:11:58.296
"Mr. Clutter
in navy-blue flannel,
his wife in navy-blue crepe.

01:11:58.331 --> 01:12:03.301
"And it was this especially
that lent the scene
an awful aura,

01:12:03.336 --> 01:12:06.304
"the head of each
was completely encased
in cotton.

01:12:07.305 --> 01:12:08.772
"A swollen cocoon

01:12:08.807 --> 01:12:11.810
"twice the size of
an ordinary blown-up balloon.

01:12:12.811 --> 01:12:14.277
"And the cotton,

01:12:14.312 --> 01:12:17.816
"because it had been sprayed
with a glossy substance,

01:12:17.851 --> 01:12:20.318
"twinkled like
Christmas tree snow.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:26.825
"One Tuesday at dawn,
a carload of strangers,

01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:29.292
"ignorant
of the local disaster,

01:12:29.327 --> 01:12:32.330
"were startled
by what they saw
as they crossed the prairies

01:12:32.365 --> 01:12:34.332
"and passed through Holcomb.

01:12:34.367 --> 01:12:36.800
"Windows ablaze.

01:12:36.835 --> 01:12:39.803
"Almost every window
in almost every house,

01:12:39.838 --> 01:12:43.341
"and in
the brightly-lit rooms,
fully-clothed people,

01:12:43.376 --> 01:12:45.343
"even entire families,

01:12:45.844 --> 01:12:50.849
"who had sat
the whole night wide awake
watchful, listening.

01:12:51.349 --> 01:12:53.351
"Of what
were they frightened?

01:12:54.352 --> 01:12:56.354
It might happen again."

01:12:58.857 --> 01:13:00.358
Thank you.

01:13:23.882 --> 01:13:26.317
And I slipped
and I ripped a hole

01:13:26.352 --> 01:13:28.753
from the bottom
of my scrotum...

01:13:29.254 --> 01:13:30.220
[all laughing]

01:13:30.255 --> 01:13:33.258
All the way
up to the top
of the crack of my ass.

01:13:34.259 --> 01:13:36.226
And I sat there.

01:13:36.261 --> 01:13:39.229
And I didn't know it.
All I felt was a...

01:13:39.264 --> 01:13:42.767
I... I didn't know it.
All I felt was a cool breeze
you know, between my...

01:13:46.271 --> 01:13:48.273
[hesitantly]
Sorry. If I may, uh...

01:13:49.774 --> 01:13:51.276
yes.

01:13:51.776 --> 01:13:55.280
Your portrait of those men
was terrifying.

01:13:56.281 --> 01:13:57.282
Terrifying.

01:13:59.284 --> 01:14:00.785
[Laughing]
Thank you.

01:14:03.788 --> 01:14:06.791
Stop that man!
Come back here!

01:14:07.292 --> 01:14:08.258
Dad!

01:14:08.293 --> 01:14:10.295
[All laughing]

01:14:12.297 --> 01:14:14.299
Have any of you
met my father?

01:14:14.334 --> 01:14:16.301
[Laughing]

01:14:18.803 --> 01:14:21.306
He hasn't spanked me
in years.

01:14:22.307 --> 01:14:25.310
George didn't come backstage.

01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:27.277
(William)
He had... he had a...

01:14:27.312 --> 01:14:30.315
something that his wife
had to rush him off to.

01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:31.781
But he made a point of...

01:14:31.816 --> 01:14:34.318
yeah, well, I’m still wal...
I’m still waiting for a call.

01:14:34.353 --> 01:14:36.821
It was beautiful.
And everybody came.
Hmm. Tennessee...

01:14:36.856 --> 01:14:38.323
everybody came.
Tennessee loved it.

01:14:38.823 --> 01:14:39.824
Of course he loved it.

01:14:40.825 --> 01:14:42.792
Should we do more?

01:14:42.827 --> 01:14:45.830
No, we... we just sit and wait
while people talk about it

01:14:46.331 --> 01:14:49.299
and we let them do the work.

01:14:49.334 --> 01:14:53.338
I mean,
this... this book is going
to change everything.

01:14:53.838 --> 01:14:56.841
It's gonna change
how people see your writing.

01:14:59.844 --> 01:15:02.847
I think it's going to Chan
how people write.

01:15:06.351 --> 01:15:08.853
Are you gonna be finished
by October?

01:15:08.888 --> 01:15:10.355
I think so.

01:15:13.358 --> 01:15:16.361
You know, they're scheduled
for next month.

01:15:16.396 --> 01:15:17.362
To hang.

01:15:18.363 --> 01:15:20.330
Yeah.

01:15:20.365 --> 01:15:25.370
We're gonna commit
as many issues
as it takes to publish.

01:15:25.405 --> 01:15:27.337
Whatever it takes.

01:15:27.372 --> 01:15:29.874
Well, I’m going to Kansas
tomorrow, and...

01:15:31.376 --> 01:15:32.877
and I’ll get Perry to talk.

01:15:32.912 --> 01:15:34.879
What's he got to lose?

01:15:37.382 --> 01:15:38.883
Sorry, but...

01:15:43.388 --> 01:15:45.890
hey, this may
sound strange to you,

01:15:46.891 --> 01:15:49.143
but I’m going to miss him.

01:15:49.178 --> 01:15:51.396
You'll be able to finish now.

01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:04.459
[Keys clinking]

01:16:14.469 --> 01:16:16.471
(guard)
Need to check your
papers, sir.

01:16:20.475 --> 01:16:21.977
This is what we've been
waiting for.

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:24.980
A stay of execution
to make a federal appeal.

01:16:25.015 --> 01:16:26.982
All thanks to you.

01:16:28.984 --> 01:16:30.951
Thank you!

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:32.452
They're not gonna
corner me now.

01:16:32.487 --> 01:16:35.490
Not unless the U.S.
Government says so.

01:16:35.525 --> 01:16:38.493
Kansas has had it in
for me for 10 years.

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:40.996
They can't corner me now.
Mmm-mmm.

01:16:41.031 --> 01:16:42.998
Hey, Perry, sit down

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:45.500
for a minute.

01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:52.507
I... I need you to talk to me.

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:55.010
We've got all the time
in the world to talk.

01:16:55.045 --> 01:16:56.977
I've been
thinking about Ricardo.

01:16:57.012 --> 01:17:00.015
You really need
to stop sending him
those trashy books.

01:17:01.516 --> 01:17:03.518
I won't even
mention the pornography.

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:05.485
Now, I realize that

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:08.523
Dick probably can't
grasp the literature
that you gave me.

01:17:09.024 --> 01:17:11.776
Uh, the books you
send him only...

01:17:11.811 --> 01:17:14.922
they only exacerbate
the problem.

01:17:14.957 --> 01:17:17.998
They only heighten
or intensify it.

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:20.035
Maybe we can get him
started on a program.
Perry,

01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:22.537
I know what
"exacerbate" means.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.506
Ok, well, just thinking...

01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:28.543
there... there's not
a word or a sentence

01:17:29.044 --> 01:17:31.796
or a concept that you
can illuminate for me.

01:17:31.831 --> 01:17:34.549
There is one singular reas
I keep coming here.

01:17:34.584 --> 01:17:38.053
Truman.
November 14, 1959.

01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:41.556
3 years ago. 3 years.

01:17:43.058 --> 01:17:44.524
Hmm?

01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:47.562
And that's... that's all
I want to hear from you.

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:56.571
Now I asked you not to. Ever.

01:17:57.572 --> 01:18:00.075
This is absurd.

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:02.577
Do you know
what absurd means?

01:18:06.581 --> 01:18:09.584
I'm ready.
I have a plane to catch.

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:12.552
I found your sister
in Tacoma.

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:15.590
Maybe she'll talk to me
about something useful.

01:18:19.594 --> 01:18:21.096
Please don't go out there.

01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:26.101
Hey, this is my work, Perry.

01:18:26.136 --> 01:18:28.068
I'm working.

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:31.606
And when you want to tell
what I need to hear,
you let me know.

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:44.369
(Linda)
June's dead.

01:18:44.404 --> 01:18:46.121
Frank shot himself.

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:50.125
Now Perry did what he did.

01:18:52.627 --> 01:18:55.630
I used to love him.
He was my little doll.

01:18:56.631 --> 01:18:58.598
He scares me now.

You believe he's gentle
and so easily hurt,

01:19:27.662 --> 01:19:31.666

kill you as shake your hand.
I believe that.

It is my business,

01:21:17.139 --> 01:21:19.607
The organizers of
the reading needed a title.

01:21:19.642 --> 01:21:21.574
They picked one,

01:21:21.609 --> 01:21:24.112

I haven't chosen one yet.

talked about that night?

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:49.470

I couldn't possibly.

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.481
I'm sorry.

01:22:02.483 --> 01:22:04.485
I should have told you.

01:22:05.486 --> 01:22:08.489

to be your friend

from your sister.

01:23:34.409 --> 01:23:38.196
There must be
something wrong with us,
to do what we did.

01:23:50.208 --> 01:23:53.094
We heard there was
$10,000 in that house.

01:23:54.095 --> 01:23:58.099
Once we tied up everybody
and searched all over,

01:23:58.599 --> 01:24:01.101
I knew the guy
that told us about it was...

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:03.604
was wrong. There was...
there was no money.

01:24:06.107 --> 01:24:08.357
Dick wouldn't believe it

01:24:08.392 --> 01:24:10.394
so he went tearing
through the house,

01:24:10.429 --> 01:24:12.163
banging on the walls

01:24:12.198 --> 01:24:13.898
looking for a safe.

01:24:18.402 --> 01:24:21.871
When he was done, he...

01:24:21.906 --> 01:24:25.910
said he was gonna go up
to Nancy's room
and have his way with her.

01:24:26.911 --> 01:24:28.913
I wouldn't allow it.

01:24:29.914 --> 01:24:31.916
And I told him that.

01:24:33.417 --> 01:24:34.919
So I sat with her.

01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:37.887
Dick came up and got me.

01:24:37.922 --> 01:24:42.426
We turned off the lights
and went down to the basement

01:24:42.461 --> 01:24:44.929
where Mr. Clutter
and the boy was.

01:24:48.432 --> 01:24:50.434
He kept saying,
"no witnesses," but I...

01:24:51.936 --> 01:24:54.403
I figured
if I waited him out, he'd...

01:24:54.438 --> 01:24:57.441
he'd give up
and we'd leave them
tied up there.

01:24:57.942 --> 01:25:01.410
And we'd drive all night.
They'd never find us.

01:25:01.445 --> 01:25:06.951
We tied Mr. Clutter's wrists
to a pipe over his head.

01:25:06.986 --> 01:25:10.419
And he... he looked hurt,
so I cut him down.

01:25:10.454 --> 01:25:14.458
I... I put a box out there
so he'd be more comfortable.

01:25:17.461 --> 01:25:21.965
He asked how his wife
and daughter was
and I... I said they were fine,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.470
and they were getting ready
for sleep, and it wouldn't
be long tili...

01:25:26.505 --> 01:25:28.973
till morning
when they'd find him.

01:25:37.481 --> 01:25:39.483
He was just looking at me.

01:25:40.484 --> 01:25:42.486
Looking into my eyes.

01:25:43.988 --> 01:25:47.456

to kill him.

01:25:47.491 --> 01:25:51.495

the kind of person
who would kill him.

"this... this nice man
is scared of me."

01:26:08.512 --> 01:26:10.014
I was so ashamed.

he was a... a very nice...

01:26:22.526 --> 01:26:23.527

01:26:25.529 --> 01:26:28.532

till I slit his throat.

01:40:16.076 --> 01:40:17.577
You got the letter?

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:21.081
Yes, I did.

01:40:25.085 --> 01:40:27.052
(Perry)
It's true.

01:40:27.087 --> 01:40:29.089
I understand why you
didn't want to come.

01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:33.593
I wouldn't be here either
if I didn't have to.

01:40:33.628 --> 01:40:35.095
(Richard)
You got that right.

01:40:39.599 --> 01:40:44.069
You know Ricardo
donated his eyes
to science?

01:40:44.104 --> 01:40:48.608
Next week,
some blind man will be seeing
what Dick used to see.

01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:51.611
Yeah, you could be
walking in Denver
or somewhere, Truman,

01:40:52.112 --> 01:40:55.615
and suddenly these eyes
will be staring at you.

01:40:55.650 --> 01:40:58.118
That would be something,
wouldn't it?

01:40:59.119 --> 01:41:02.122
It would be. It would be.

01:41:07.627 --> 01:41:08.128
[Sobbing]

01:41:16.136 --> 01:41:18.138
(Perry)
You'll be watching?

01:41:19.639 --> 01:41:21.141
I don't know, I’ll be...

01:41:23.643 --> 01:41:25.145
do you want me to?

01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:32.152
I'd like to have
a friend there.

01:41:33.153 --> 01:41:35.655
Ok. Then I will.

01:41:46.666 --> 01:41:48.168
It's all right.

01:42:07.187 --> 01:42:09.189
I did everything I could.

01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:11.191
It's ok.

01:42:21.535 --> 01:42:23.036
I truly did.

01:42:24.538 --> 01:42:25.956
I know.

01:42:34.965 --> 01:42:35.966
It's time.

01:42:46.476 --> 01:42:47.978
Mr. Capote.

01:43:03.994 --> 01:43:05.460
Goodbye.

01:43:05.495 --> 01:43:08.463
You're not rid of us yet.

01:43:08.498 --> 01:43:10.250
We'll see you
in a few minutes.

01:43:10.285 --> 01:43:12.002
I wish I had...
Mr. Capote.

01:43:13.003 --> 01:43:15.005
Mr. Capote.
Goodbye.

01:44:02.002 --> 01:44:05.005
[Chains clinking]

01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:12.012
Nice to see you.

01:44:55.055 --> 01:44:57.022
(Warden)
Perry Edward Smith.

01:44:57.057 --> 01:44:59.059
For the crime of murder
in the first degree,

01:44:59.094 --> 01:45:00.560
by order of the cour
t of Finney county

01:45:01.061 --> 01:45:03.063
and the supreme court
of the sovereign state
of Kansas,

01:45:03.098 --> 01:45:04.564
you are sentenced
to hang until you die.

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:07.817
"I will fear no evil:
For thou art with me.

01:45:07.852 --> 01:45:10.570
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me."

01:45:10.605 --> 01:45:12.572
You can say something
if you want.

01:45:18.078 --> 01:45:20.580
Is there anybody
from the family here?

01:45:21.581 --> 01:45:22.582
No, Perry.

01:45:27.587 --> 01:45:29.089
Well, tell them...

01:45:35.095 --> 01:45:39.599
I can't remember
what I was gonna
say for the life of me.

01:45:58.118 --> 01:46:01.121
Our father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

01:46:01.621 --> 01:46:03.088
Thy kingdom come.

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:06.126
[Perry breathing heavily]
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:46:06.161 --> 01:46:08.593
Give us this day
our daily bread.

01:46:08.628 --> 01:46:12.597
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:46:12.632 --> 01:46:16.136
And lead us not
into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

01:46:18.138 --> 01:46:19.139
[Banging]

01:46:45.665 --> 01:46:48.168
It was a terrible experience

01:46:51.171 --> 01:46:53.673
and I will never get over it.

01:46:55.675 --> 01:46:59.179
(Nelle)
They're dead, Truman.
You're alive.

01:47:01.181 --> 01:47:04.684
And there wasn't anything
I could have done
to save them.

01:47:07.687 --> 01:47:09.189
Maybe not,

01:47:12.692 --> 01:47:15.195
but, the fact is,
you didn't want to.
