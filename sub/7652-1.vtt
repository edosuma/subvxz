00:49.717 --> 00:51.437
Mommy's going to the
beauty parlor, darling.

00:52.261 --> 00:55.054
But I'm leaving you
with your favorite friend, Roger.

00:55.139 --> 00:57.807
He is going to take
very, very good care of you.

00:57.891 --> 01:01.728
Because if he doesn't,
he's going back to the science lab!

01:01.812 --> 01:05.188
P-p-please, don't worry.
Whatever you say.

01:05.274 --> 01:08.901
Yes, ma'am. Aye, aye, sir. Okeydokey.

01:08.986 --> 01:12.363
Why, I'll take care of him
like he was my own brother.

01:12.448 --> 01:14.615
Or my own sister.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.660
Or my brother's sister.
Or my second cousin

01:17.745 --> 01:19.787
- who is twice removed.
- Gobble. Cookie.

01:19.872 --> 01:23.791
Or my ninth cousin, who is nine times
removed from his place outside.

01:23.876 --> 01:28.504
Or like my 15th cousin, who is 16 times
removed from my mother's side.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.923
Or like my 27th cousin,
who is 37 times...

01:31.008 --> 01:32.884
- Cookie.
- ...removed from my father's side.

01:35.888 --> 01:41.392
Like my 17th cousin, who is
156 times removed from any side!

01:51.862 --> 01:55.198
I'll save you, Baby!

01:56.033 --> 01:57.366
Cookie.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.369
Don't burn yourself,
Baby Herman.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.634
Who turned out the lights?
It's dark in here.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.178
Don't they pay their electricity?

02:17.262 --> 02:20.181
What's happened?
I'll find you, Baby. Where are you?

02:21.058 --> 02:22.975
- Where are you?
- Cookie.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.060
Where'd you go?

02:24.394 --> 02:26.604
What's that smoke?

03:06.311 --> 03:07.603
Cookie.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.027
Cookie.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.410
I'm here, Baby...

03:44.975 --> 03:45.975
Cookie.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.827
Cookie.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.335
- Cut!
- All right. That's it, guys.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.339
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

04:16.423 --> 04:18.423
What the hell
was wrong with that take?

04:18.507 --> 04:20.635
Nothing with you, Baby Herman.
You were great. You were perfect.

04:20.719 --> 04:23.440
You were better than perfect.
It's Roger! He keeps blowing his lines!

04:24.514 --> 04:27.350
- Roger, what's this?
- A tweeting bird?

04:27.434 --> 04:31.062
"A tweeting bird?" Roger, read
the script. Look what it says!

04:31.146 --> 04:33.147
It says, "Rabbit gets clunked,
rabbit sees stars."

04:34.524 --> 04:36.609
Not birds, stars!

04:36.693 --> 04:38.444
Can we lose the playback, please?

04:38.528 --> 04:40.196
- Roger, you're killing me! Killing me!
- Cut the playback!

04:40.280 --> 04:41.697
For cryin' out loud, Roger!

04:41.782 --> 04:44.367
How many times do we have to
do this damn scene?

04:44.534 --> 04:47.578
Raoul, I'll be in my trailer, takin' a nap!

04:47.663 --> 04:49.205
Excuse me, toots.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.166
My stomach can't take this.
This set is a mess.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.336
Clean this set up! And get him out
of there, or seal him up in it!

04:55.420 --> 04:57.630
- Lose the lights! And say "lunch"!
- Lunch!

04:57.714 --> 05:00.007
That's lunch. We're on a half.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.467
P-please, Raoul. I can give you stars!

05:01.551 --> 05:04.178
Just drop the refrigerator on my head
one more time!

05:04.262 --> 05:06.472
Roger, I dropped it on your head
23 times already.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.684
- I can take it! Don't worry about me.
- I'm not worried about you.

05:09.768 --> 05:12.019
I'm worried about the refrigerator.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.731
I can give you stars. Look. Look!

05:16.066 --> 05:18.609
Look!

05:18.986 --> 05:21.654
Please, Raoul,
I can do it, I swear.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.365
Just give me another chance.
Oh, come on, Raoul.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.700
Toons.

05:26.118 --> 05:29.370
Look! Look, Raoul! Look, Raoul!

05:31.748 --> 05:33.290
Come on, Raoul!

05:34.584 --> 05:36.627
Mr. Maroon, Mr. Valiant's here to...

05:36.712 --> 05:39.338
He'll be right with you.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.476
No, no, no!
Wait until he gets to his feet.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.854
- Then hit him with the boulder.
- Right, R. K.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.234
How much do you know
about show business, Mr. Valiant?

06:00.318 --> 06:03.362
Only there's no business like it,
no business I know.

06:03.447 --> 06:06.198
Yeah, and there's no business
more expensive.

06:06.283 --> 06:09.535
I'm 25 grand over budget on
the latest Baby Herman cartoon.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.037
You saw the rabbit blowin' his lines.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.830
He can't keep his mind on the work.
You know why?

06:12.914 --> 06:15.291
One too many refrigerators
dropped on his head?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.375
Nah, he's a Toon.

06:16.460 --> 06:19.378
You can drop anything you want
on his head. He'll shake it off.

06:19.463 --> 06:22.715
But break his heart, he goes to pieces,
just like you or me.

06:22.799 --> 06:23.966
Read that.

06:27.012 --> 06:30.222
"Seen cooing over calamari
with not-so-new sugar daddy,"

06:30.307 --> 06:34.185
"was Jessica Rabbit,
wife of Maroon Cartoon star Roger."

06:34.269 --> 06:35.811
What's this got to do with me?

06:35.896 --> 06:37.938
You're the private detective.
You figure it out.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.899
Look, I don't have time for this.

06:39.983 --> 06:43.569
Look, Valiant, his wife's poison,
but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.238
I want you to follow her,

06:46.323 --> 06:50.326
get me a couple of nice, juicy pictures
I can wise the rabbit up with.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.579
- Forget it. I don't work Toontown.
- What's wrong with Toontown?

06:53.663 --> 06:54.914
Every Joe loves Toontown.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.625
Then get Joe to do the job,
'cause I ain't goin'.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.419
Fella.
You don't want to go to Toontown,

07:00.504 --> 07:02.421
you don't have to go to Toontown.

07:02.506 --> 07:05.508
Nobody said you had to
go to Toontown anyway.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.594
Have a seat, Valiant.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.680
The rabbit's wife sings at a joint
called the Ink and Paint Club.

07:12.349 --> 07:15.976
"Toon Revue."
Strictly humans only, okay?

07:17.062 --> 07:18.979
So what do you think, Valiant?

07:21.024 --> 07:22.233
Well?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.866
The job's gonna cost you
100 bucks, plus expenses.

07:30.951 --> 07:31.992
A hundred bucks?

07:32.077 --> 07:34.453
- That's ridiculous!
- So's the job.

07:35.038 --> 07:38.457
All right, all right.
You got your 100 bucks.

07:38.542 --> 07:41.961
- Have a drink, Eddie.
- I don't mind if I do.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.462
- I got it.
- Careful, Dave.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.506
- I got it!
- Dave, you're gonna drop it!

07:45.590 --> 07:48.217
- I'm not gonna drop it!
- You're droppin' it!

07:48.301 --> 07:50.553
Watch it! Oh, no! Jeez!

07:59.354 --> 08:00.479
Come on!

08:05.485 --> 08:07.528
Kind of jumpy, aren't you, Valiant?

08:08.405 --> 08:11.282
- It's just Dumbo.
- I know who it is.

08:11.366 --> 08:16.162
I got him on loan from Disney,
him and half the cast of Fantasia.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.748
The best part is

08:20.667 --> 08:23.085
they work for peanuts.

08:29.759 --> 08:33.679
Well, I don't work for peanuts.
Where's the other 50?

08:34.264 --> 08:38.392
Let's call the other 50
a carrot to finish the job.

08:39.269 --> 08:42.104
You've been hanging
around rabbits too long.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.634
W-Whoop! Whoop!

09:11.718 --> 09:13.802
W-w-

09:16.014 --> 09:17.556
Oh, excuse me!

09:38.828 --> 09:40.829
Please, help. Oh, I'm sorry.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.790
Get out of my way!

09:45.168 --> 09:48.420
Oh, taxi? Oh, cab?

09:48.672 --> 09:53.592
Right here! Right here!

09:58.390 --> 09:59.848
What do I look like, a bank?

10:09.693 --> 10:10.776
Wait for me!

10:10.860 --> 10:12.569
- Come on!
- Guys, wait up!

10:12.654 --> 10:15.656
- Come on, hurry up! Come on, Sig!
- Hurry up!

10:15.740 --> 10:18.617
- Hey, mister, ain't you got a car?
- Who needs a car in L.A.?

10:18.702 --> 10:21.161
We got the best public
transportation system in the world.

10:45.228 --> 10:46.468
- Hey, so long.
- See you later!

10:46.479 --> 10:48.320
- So long, mister!
- Thanks for the cigarettes.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.732
- You bet.
- Anytime.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.925
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, Eddie. How's it going?

11:01.995 --> 11:03.162
Okay. What you got for me?

11:03.246 --> 11:04.413
The usual bills.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.334
Hey, give back my ball!

11:13.798 --> 11:15.090
Hello, fella.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.390
- Hi, Harry. Are you okay?
- Hey.

11:32.734 --> 11:33.942
What's with Earl?

11:38.615 --> 11:41.533
- Laid off?
- A new outfit bought the Red Car.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.702
Some big company called Cloverleaf.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.954
No kiddin'. They bought the Red Car?

11:46.039 --> 11:50.084
Yeah, and put the poor guy on
two weeks' notice. Cutbacks, they said.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.297
Oh, well.

11:56.925 --> 12:01.136
Here's to the pencil pushers.
May they all get lead poisoning?

12:04.724 --> 12:09.645
Tomorrow's Friday, Eddie. You know
what happens here on Friday?

12:09.729 --> 12:13.107
- Fish special?
- My boss checks the books on Friday.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.567
And if I don't have that money
I gave you back in the till,

12:15.652 --> 12:16.944
I'm gonna lose my job.

12:17.028 --> 12:20.114
Don't bust a button, Dolores.
You've only got one left.

12:21.199 --> 12:22.449
50 bucks?

12:23.785 --> 12:24.910
Where's the rest?

12:25.954 --> 12:28.163
Well, it's only a snoop job away.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.542
You got that camera of yours?
Mine's in the shop.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.586
Wouldn't be the pawn shop
by any chance, would it?

12:33.670 --> 12:35.170
Oh, come on, Dolores.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.506
You need the other 50.
I need the camera.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.470
Any film in there?

12:44.973 --> 12:46.974
Should be.

12:47.058 --> 12:50.102
I haven't had that roll
developed since our trip to Catalina.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.981
- That sure was a long time ago.
- Yeah, that was a long time ago.

12:54.065 --> 12:57.484
- Let's do that again sometime.
- Yeah, sure, Eddie.

13:03.366 --> 13:07.077
- That paper even good?
- Just check the scrawl.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.413
R. K. Maroon, as in Maroon Cartoons?

13:09.497 --> 13:11.623
Maroon Cartoons?

13:12.208 --> 13:16.628
Hey. So who's your client,
Mr. Detective-To-The-Stars?

13:16.713 --> 13:20.215
Chilly Willy?
Or Screwy Squirrel?

13:21.718 --> 13:24.636
- What do you want to drink?
- I'll take a beer, doll.

13:24.721 --> 13:28.223
So what happened?
Somebody kidnap Dinky Doodle?

13:28.308 --> 13:30.058
Cut it out, Angelo.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.102
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. I know.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.896
You're working for Little Bo Peep.

13:33.980 --> 13:37.024
She's lost her sheep and
you're gonna help her find them.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.317
Hey?

13:42.113 --> 13:44.198
Get this straight, meatball.

13:44.282 --> 13:47.576
I don't work for Toons!

13:54.250 --> 13:55.834
So what's his problem?

13:58.630 --> 14:00.756
- A Toon killed his brother.
- What?

14:03.092 --> 14:04.760
Dropped a piano on his head.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.650
Got the password?

14:19.734 --> 14:21.652
Walt sent me.

14:36.125 --> 14:39.211
- Nice monkey suit.
- Wiseass.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.241
All right.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.493
Hey, look at that!

15:12.912 --> 15:14.913
Hey! Hey! Cut it out!

15:14.998 --> 15:17.624
Does anybody understand
what this duck is saying?

15:23.089 --> 15:25.882
- Most amusing.
- A little more wine.

15:27.468 --> 15:31.972
I've worked with a lot of wise quackers,
but you are despicable.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.266
Doggone stubborn nitwit!

15:34.350 --> 15:36.101
That did it!

15:36.185 --> 15:39.479
This is the last time I work with
someone with a speech impediment.

15:39.564 --> 15:40.814
Oh, yeah?

15:42.191 --> 15:45.193
This means war.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.665
- What, you think that's funny?
- It's a panic.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.543
You won't think it's funny
when I stick that pen up your nose.

16:01.628 --> 16:05.881
Now, calm down, son, will ya? Look,
the stain's gone. It's disappearing ink.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.549
No hard feelings, I hope.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.052
- Look, I'm... I'm...
- I know who you are.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.096
Marvin Acme, the guy that
owns Toontown. The gag king.

16:13.181 --> 16:15.974
If it's Acme, it's a gasser.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.142
Put it there, pal.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.898
The hand buzzer.
It's still our biggest seller.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.281
Scotch on the rocks.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.533
And I mean ice!

16:39.707 --> 16:41.083
This is hot stuff!

17:19.454 --> 17:23.083
Hey, those ducks are funny.
They never get to finish the act!

17:24.585 --> 17:26.920
Great. Thanks.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.886
- Toons.
- Cigars? Cigarettes?

17:34.971 --> 17:38.390
- Eddie Valiant!
- Betty?

17:38.474 --> 17:40.600
Long time no see.

17:40.810 --> 17:41.977
What are you doing here?

17:42.103 --> 17:45.731
Work's been kinda slow
since cartoons went to color.

17:45.815 --> 17:49.484
But I still got it, Eddie.
Boop-boop-be-doop, boop!

17:50.403 --> 17:52.988
Yeah, you still got it.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.329
What's with him?

18:01.414 --> 18:05.000
Mr. Acme never misses a night
when Jessica performs.

18:05.460 --> 18:06.835
Got a thing for rabbits?

18:16.345 --> 18:19.598
You had plenty money

18:19.682 --> 18:20.182
In 1922

18:24.312 --> 18:27.272
You let other women

18:27.356 --> 18:30.776
Make a fool of you

18:30.860 --> 18:34.404
Why don't you do right

18:36.699 --> 18:42.370
Like some other men do?

18:47.543 --> 18:51.338
Get out of here

18:51.422 --> 18:52.547
Give me some money too

18:52.632 --> 18:54.716
She's married to Roger Rabbit?

18:54.801 --> 18:58.720
Yeah. What a lucky girl.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.476
Now if you had prepared

19:04.560 --> 19:08.730
20 years ago

19:08.815 --> 19:12.275
You wouldn't be wanderin' now

19:12.360 --> 19:14.820
From door to door

19:14.904 --> 19:19.407
Why don't you do right

19:20.827 --> 19:27.332
Like some other men do?

19:31.629 --> 19:35.173
Get out of here

19:35.258 --> 19:40.387
Give me some money too

19:46.143 --> 19:49.729
Get out of here

19:49.814 --> 19:54.776
Give me some money too

19:58.906 --> 20:04.578
Why don't you do right

20:05.162 --> 20:09.958
Like some other men

20:12.545 --> 20:13.045
Do?

20:45.328 --> 20:47.370
Who is it?

20:47.455 --> 20:50.999
Jessica, dear, have no fear.
Your Marvin is here.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.920
You sure murdered 'em
again tonight, baby.

20:55.004 --> 20:58.798
I really mean it.
My darling, you were superb.

20:58.883 --> 21:04.262
You absolutely, truly and honestly
"fashmolyed" that audience.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.848
You killed them. You slayed them.

21:06.933 --> 21:10.268
You belted them into little pieces.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.481
What do you think
you're doin', chump?

21:14.565 --> 21:16.608
Who are you callin' a chump, chimp?

21:24.992 --> 21:28.620
And don't let me catch your
peepin' face around here again!

21:28.704 --> 21:31.081
Got it?

21:31.207 --> 21:32.624
Ooga-booga!

21:52.436 --> 21:54.646
Come, my dear Jessica.
Come over here.

21:54.730 --> 21:58.566
I got everything arranged,
right here on the bed.

21:58.901 --> 22:02.153
Oh, not tonight, Marvin.
I have a headache.

22:02.238 --> 22:05.281
Oh, Jessica, you promised.

22:05.366 --> 22:07.325
Oh, all right.

22:07.410 --> 22:10.203
But this time, take off that hand buzzer.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.332
Patty-cake.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.210
Patty-cake.

22:17.294 --> 22:20.171
- Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
- Oh, Marvin.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.048
Patty-cake.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.717
- Marvin.
- Patty-cake.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.720
- Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
- Oh, Marvin!

22:26.804 --> 22:28.847
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

22:28.931 --> 22:30.971
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

22:31.100 --> 22:33.685
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

22:33.769 --> 22:36.396
I don't believe it!

22:38.774 --> 22:42.068
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

22:42.153 --> 22:44.195
Is that true?

22:44.280 --> 22:45.363
Take comfort, son.

22:45.448 --> 22:48.241
You're not the first man whose wife
played patty-cake on him.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.459
I just don't believe it.

22:58.169 --> 23:00.754
I won't believe it. I can't believe it.

23:00.838 --> 23:02.505
I shan't believe it.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.257
Believe it, kid.

23:04.341 --> 23:05.967
I took the pictures myself.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.761
She played patty-cake.

23:07.845 --> 23:11.514
No, not my Jessica. Not patty-cake.

23:11.599 --> 23:14.642
This is impossible.
I don't believe it. It can't be!

23:14.727 --> 23:17.312
It just can't be! Jessica's my wife!

23:17.396 --> 23:20.106
It's absolutely impossible!

23:20.524 --> 23:22.108
Jessica's the light of my life,

23:22.193 --> 23:25.445
the apple of my eye,
the cream in my coffee!

23:25.529 --> 23:28.656
You better start drinking it black,
'cause Acme's taking the cream now.

23:28.741 --> 23:32.535
Hard to believe. Marvin Acme's been
my friend and neighbor for 30 years.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.537
Who would've thought
he was a sugar daddy?

23:34.622 --> 23:37.207
Somebody must have
made her do it!

23:37.291 --> 23:39.959
Now drink this, son.
It'll make you feel better.

24:12.326 --> 24:14.786
Thanks. I needed that.

24:18.374 --> 24:20.333
Son of a bitch.

24:22.044 --> 24:23.795
Look, Mr. Maroon.

24:25.381 --> 24:27.590
I think my work here is finished.

24:27.675 --> 24:28.955
How about that carrot
you owe me?

24:30.052 --> 24:32.470
- A deal's a deal.
- Great.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.764
Thanks.

24:36.183 --> 24:40.395
Roger, I know all this
seems pretty painful now,

24:40.479 --> 24:42.856
but you'll find someone new.

24:42.940 --> 24:45.733
- Won't he, Mr. Valiant?
- Yeah, sure.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.319
Good-looking guy like that.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.155
The dames will be
breaking his door down.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.656
Dames? What dames?

24:51.740 --> 24:52.991
Jessica is the only one for me!

24:53.075 --> 24:55.660
You'll see! We'll rise above
this piddling peccadillo!

24:55.744 --> 24:56.744
We're going to be happy again!

24:56.829 --> 24:59.747
You got that? Happy.
Capital H-A-P-P-I...

25:07.464 --> 25:09.132
Well, at least he took it well.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.269
Oh, Jessica!

25:21.770 --> 25:25.231
Please tell me it's not true.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.112
P-p-please!

27:51.128 --> 27:53.629
Oh, Lieutenant Santino.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.425
Where'd you come from?

27:58.761 --> 28:02.221
Gee whiz, Eddie. If you needed money
so bad, why didn't you come to me?

28:02.723 --> 28:05.850
So I took a couple of
dirty pictures. So kill me.

28:05.934 --> 28:08.227
I already got a stiff
on my hands, thank you.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.189
Marvin Acme.

28:12.066 --> 28:13.858
The rabbit cacked him last night.

28:14.568 --> 28:15.526
What?

28:26.288 --> 28:27.622
Now what?

28:28.791 --> 28:31.417
It's just I haven't been this close
to Toontown for a while.

28:31.960 --> 28:32.460
Yeeow!

28:38.467 --> 28:41.552
My biscuits are burnin'!
Fire in the hatch!

28:41.637 --> 28:43.971
Eee! Great horny toads, that smarts!

28:49.812 --> 28:52.021
Come on, Eddie.
Let's get this over with.

28:53.816 --> 28:54.899
I didn't see anything.

28:54.983 --> 28:57.151
Maybe you heard a noise or something.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.153
- He's with me.
- Nothin'.

28:59.238 --> 29:02.115
- Are you sure?
- Come on, kid.

29:02.199 --> 29:03.783
Are you sure you didn't see anything?

29:03.867 --> 29:06.577
- What about you, fella?
- I didn't see anything.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.746
- I came in to work.
- Come on, Lieutenant.

29:08.831 --> 29:12.542
Just like a Toon to drop
a safe on a guy's head.

29:12.626 --> 29:14.043
Sorry, Eddie.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.754
You better wait here, all right?

29:16.839 --> 29:18.423
You got a positive I. D.?

29:23.387 --> 29:25.346
Must be.

29:29.685 --> 29:31.727
Hey, Chisold, get a load of this.

29:32.855 --> 29:34.647
You've seen one of these?

29:38.068 --> 29:40.611
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys.

29:51.748 --> 29:55.293
Didn't you used to be Eddie Valiant?

29:55.377 --> 29:58.171
Or did you change your name
to Jack Daniels?

30:05.971 --> 30:08.806
- What's that?
- Paint from the rabbit's glove.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.893
Mr. Valiant?

30:15.397 --> 30:17.690
I hope you're proud of yourself

30:17.774 --> 30:19.650
and those pictures you took.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.762
For crying out loud, Mike!
Hey, we need a little help over here!

30:29.786 --> 30:32.747
Hey, somebody grab those loafers!

30:33.707 --> 30:35.208
Hey, Mike, come here!

30:39.588 --> 30:42.089
I got these. Come on. Come on.
Those shoes over there.

31:01.568 --> 31:04.529
Is this man removing evidence
from the scene of a crime?

31:04.613 --> 31:07.949
No, Judge Doom. Valiant here
was just pickin' it up for you.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.076
Weren't you, Eddie?

31:11.370 --> 31:13.162
- Hand it over.
- Sure.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.125
His number-one seller.

31:20.295 --> 31:23.339
I see working for a Toon
has rubbed off on you.

31:23.423 --> 31:27.093
I wasn't working for a Toon.
I was working for R. K. Maroon.

31:27.177 --> 31:29.428
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.

31:29.513 --> 31:31.722
He told us the rabbit
became quite agitated

31:31.807 --> 31:33.307
when you showed him the pictures.

31:33.392 --> 31:37.770
The rabbit said, one way or another,
he and his wife were going to be happy.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.313
Is that true?

31:39.398 --> 31:41.732
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?

31:41.817 --> 31:44.068
Shut your yap, Eddie.
The man's in charge.

31:44.152 --> 31:46.821
That's all right, Lieutenant.
From the smell of him,

31:46.905 --> 31:49.198
I'd say it was the booze talking.

31:50.200 --> 31:54.120
No matter. The rabbit won't get far.
My men will find him.

31:55.706 --> 31:57.748
Look out!

32:01.962 --> 32:03.087
- Weasels?
- Yes.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.256
I find they have
a special gift for the work.

32:05.340 --> 32:08.426
All right, ya mugs. Fall out.

32:08.510 --> 32:11.220
- Did you find the rabbit?
- Don't worry, Judge.

32:11.305 --> 32:14.640
We've got "deformants"
all over the city. We'll find him.

32:15.934 --> 32:19.854
You wouldn't have any idea where
the rabbit might be, Mr. Valiant?

32:21.857 --> 32:24.817
Have you tried Walla Walla?
Cucamonga?

32:24.901 --> 32:27.695
I hear Kokomo's very nice
this time of the year.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.281
I'm surprised you're not
more cooperative, Mr. Valiant.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.033
A human has been
murdered by a Toon.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.493
Don't you appreciate
the magnitude of that?

32:40.042 --> 32:43.210
Since I've had Toontown
under my jurisdiction,

32:43.295 --> 32:46.964
my goal has been
to reign in the insanity.

32:47.049 --> 32:51.260
And the only way to do that is
to make Toons respect the law.

33:04.858 --> 33:07.693
How did that gargoyle get to be a judge?

33:07.778 --> 33:11.155
He spread a bunch of simoleons
around Toontown a couple years back,

33:11.239 --> 33:12.907
bought the election.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.158
Yeah? What's that?

33:16.745 --> 33:17.953
Remember how we always thought

33:18.038 --> 33:19.497
there wasn't a way to kill a Toon?

33:19.581 --> 33:21.332
- Yeah.
- Well, Doom found a way.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.959
Turpentine, acetone, benzene.

33:24.252 --> 33:27.838
- He calls it "the dip."
- I'll catch the rabbit, Mr. Valiant.

33:27.923 --> 33:30.716
Then I'll try him, convict him

33:30.801 --> 33:33.219
and execute him.

33:49.444 --> 33:53.864
That's one dead shoe, boss?

33:53.949 --> 33:57.410
They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.

33:57.494 --> 34:01.539
But this is how we handle things
down in Toontown.

34:01.623 --> 34:04.291
I'd think you, of all people,
would appreciate that.

34:21.810 --> 34:25.187
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, wait a minute! Hey, hey!

34:28.233 --> 34:31.277
I've been tryin' to make him quit,
but he just won't listen to me.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.362
What do you know, you dumb broad?
You got the I.Q. of a rattle.

34:34.447 --> 34:36.114
- You Valiant?
- Yeah.

34:36.199 --> 34:40.077
I wanna talk to you about
the Acme murder. Hey, doll.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.288
Why don't you run downstairs
and get me a racin' form?

34:42.496 --> 34:45.875
Okay, okay. I'm goin'.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.168
The lady's man?

34:48.253 --> 34:51.589
My problem is I got a 50-year-old lust
in a 3-year-old dinky.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.132
Yeah, must be tough.

34:53.216 --> 34:56.051
Look, Valiant,
the rabbit didn't kill Acme.

34:56.136 --> 34:59.138
He's not a murderer. I should know.
He's a dear friend of mine.

34:59.222 --> 35:02.683
I tell ya, Valiant, the whole thing
stinks like yesterday's diapers.

35:02.768 --> 35:06.187
Look at this.
The paper said Acme left no will.

35:06.271 --> 35:09.940
That's a load of succotash.
Every Toon knows Acme had a will.

35:10.025 --> 35:12.318
He promised to leave Toontown
to us Toons.

35:12.402 --> 35:14.862
That will is the reason
he got bumped off.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.447
Has anybody ever seen this will?

35:16.531 --> 35:19.241
No, but he gave us his solemn oath.

35:19.326 --> 35:24.288
If you believe that that joker could do
anything solemn, the gag's on you, pal.

35:24.372 --> 35:27.917
I just figured since you were the one
who got my pal in trouble,

35:28.001 --> 35:30.169
you might want to help get him out.

35:30.253 --> 35:31.837
I can pay you.

35:32.923 --> 35:35.299
Save your money for a pair
of elevator shoes!

35:35.383 --> 35:38.886
Wait, no! Valiant, no! Oh, my stogie!

35:54.069 --> 35:56.987
It ain't my fault the rabbit
got himself in trouble.

36:00.909 --> 36:04.078
All I did was take
a couple of lousy pictures.

36:25.225 --> 36:26.892
Baby was right.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.280
The hell with it.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.521
- How the hell did you get in here?
- Through the mail slot.

37:12.606 --> 37:14.732
I thought it would be best
if I waited inside,

37:14.816 --> 37:16.567
seein' as how I'm wanted for murder!

37:16.651 --> 37:20.070
No kiddin'. Just talkin' to you could
get me a rap for aiding and abetting.

37:20.155 --> 37:23.157
Wait a minute.
Anybody know you're here?

37:23.241 --> 37:25.784
Nobody. Not a soul except...

37:25.869 --> 37:28.954
- Who?
- Well, you see...

37:29.039 --> 37:31.790
I didn't know where your office was,
so I asked the newsboy.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.543
He didn't know, so I asked
the fireman, the green grocer,

37:34.628 --> 37:36.712
the butcher, the baker.
They didn't know.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.631
But the liquor store guy, he knew.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.175
In other words, the whole
damn town knows you're here!

37:41.259 --> 37:43.135
- Get out of here! Come on. Out!
- Hey, take it easy, will ya?

37:43.219 --> 37:44.929
- Out! Get out! Come on.
- Please, Eddie, don't throw me out!

37:45.013 --> 37:46.263
- You're making a big mistake!
- Get out of here!

37:46.348 --> 37:48.599
- I didn't kill anybody! I swear!
- Let go of that door, will ya?

37:48.683 --> 37:52.061
This whole thing's a setup,
a scam, a frame job.

37:52.312 --> 37:54.730
Eddie, I could never hurt anybody.

37:54.814 --> 37:57.149
My whole purpose in life

37:57.233 --> 38:00.527
is to make people

38:01.947 --> 38:04.698
laugh!

38:05.492 --> 38:07.201
Okay, okay. Sure, I admit it.

38:07.327 --> 38:10.371
I got a little steamed when you
showed me those pictures of Jessica,

38:11.581 --> 38:14.083
so I rushed over
to the Ink and Paint Club.

38:14.167 --> 38:18.379
But she wasn't in her dressing room,
so I wrote her a love letter.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.047
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

38:20.882 --> 38:24.969
You're telling me, in a fit of jealousy,
you wrote your wife a love letter?

38:25.053 --> 38:29.974
That's right. I know that she was
just an innocent victim of circumstance.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.559
I suppose you used the old lipstick
on the mirror routine?

38:32.644 --> 38:34.728
Lipstick, yes. Mirror, no.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.606
I found a nice, clean piece of paper.

38:37.691 --> 38:42.778
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?
Let me count the ways."

38:42.862 --> 38:46.782
"One-one thousand, two-one thousand,
three-one thousand..."

38:46.866 --> 38:48.951
Why didn't you just leave
the letter there?

38:49.035 --> 38:52.663
Obviously, a poem of this power
and sensitivity must...

38:53.957 --> 38:57.084
be read in person,
so I went home to wait for her.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.837
But the weasels were there,
waiting for me.

38:59.921 --> 39:01.964
So... So I ran.

39:02.257 --> 39:06.260
So why come to me? I'm the guy
that took the pictures of your wife.

39:06.344 --> 39:09.555
Yeah, and you're also the guy
that helped all these Toons.

39:09.639 --> 39:12.182
Everybody knows,
when a Toon's in trouble,

39:12.267 --> 39:15.519
there's only one place to go,
Valiant and Valiant.

39:15.603 --> 39:17.354
Not anymore.

39:18.273 --> 39:19.898
Get out of that chair!

39:23.278 --> 39:26.447
- That's my brother's chair.
- Yeah. Where is your brother anyway?

39:26.531 --> 39:29.950
He looks like a sensitive
and sober fellow.

39:30.035 --> 39:34.121
- That's it. I'm callin' the cops.
- Go ahead. Call the cops.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.707
I come here for help,
and what do you do?

39:36.791 --> 39:40.294
You turn me in.
No, no, don't feel guilty about me.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.839
So long, and thanks for nothin'.

39:45.967 --> 39:48.761
That's the closet! Stupe.

40:01.608 --> 40:05.819
Eddie Valiant, you're under arrest.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.196
Get out!

40:07.822 --> 40:12.034
Idiot. I got no keys for these cuffs.

40:13.745 --> 40:14.912
Yah!

40:20.710 --> 40:23.754
Come on. Get the lead out.
Move it, would ya? Move it!

40:25.048 --> 40:29.551
Yah! It's the Toon Patrol!

40:32.722 --> 40:34.932
Hide me, Eddie. P-p-please!

40:37.185 --> 40:40.145
- Remember. You never saw me.
- Get out of there!

40:40.313 --> 40:43.357
Don't let 'em find me!

40:43.983 --> 40:46.610
Come on, Eddie. You're my only hope.

40:46.694 --> 40:49.947
Open up in the name of the law!

40:50.031 --> 40:51.311
- That's us.
- P-p-please, Eddie.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.826
You know there's no justice
for Toons anymore.

40:53.910 --> 40:57.621
- If the weasels get their hands on me...
- Are you in there?

40:57.705 --> 41:01.792
- I'm as good as dipped.
- Don't make us play rough, Valiant.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.128
We just want the rabbit.

41:04.212 --> 41:06.964
What are we gonna do, Eddie?
What are we gonna do?

41:07.048 --> 41:09.174
What are we gonna do?

41:09.259 --> 41:11.927
What's all this "we" stuff?
They just want the rabbit.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.732
It looks like they gave us
the slip, boss?

41:25.817 --> 41:29.027
Nah. Valiant's got him
stashed somewhere.

41:31.447 --> 41:33.740
Hold it right there.

41:35.660 --> 41:38.453
Hello, boys. I didn't hear you come in.

41:40.206 --> 41:43.208
Okay, wise guy. Where's the rabbit?

41:43.293 --> 41:44.835
I haven't seen him.

41:44.919 --> 41:48.714
- What's in there?
- My lingerie.

41:48.798 --> 41:51.300
Sheesh, Valiant.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.765
Search the place, boys.

41:59.559 --> 42:01.476
And leave no stone unturned.

42:02.687 --> 42:06.648
Look, Valiant, we got a reliable
tip-off the rabbit was here,

42:06.733 --> 42:09.443
and it was "corrugated"
by several others.

42:09.527 --> 42:12.654
So cut the "bullshtick."

42:13.239 --> 42:17.284
You keep talkin' like that, and
I'm gonna have to wash your mouth out.

42:28.963 --> 42:36.963
Stop that laughin'!

42:37.305 --> 42:41.600
You know what happens
when ya can't stop laughin'!

42:45.063 --> 42:48.315
One of these days,
you're gonna die laughin'.

42:50.777 --> 42:53.445
As for you, Valiant, step out of line,

42:53.529 --> 42:56.406
and we'll hang you and your laundry

42:56.491 --> 42:58.408
out to dry.

43:02.455 --> 43:04.623
Come on, boys. Let's "am-scray."

43:07.710 --> 43:10.671
- They're gone.
- Jeepers, Eddie, that was swell.

43:10.755 --> 43:14.383
You saved my life.
How can I ever repay ya?

43:16.052 --> 43:20.931
Blecch! For starters,
don't ever kiss me again!

43:23.184 --> 43:27.104
Stop kicking me. Stop kicking me.

43:29.524 --> 43:32.067
Dolores. Dolores!

43:32.151 --> 43:34.069
Dolores!

43:39.033 --> 43:41.326
Hey, Eddie, you made
the front page today.

43:41.411 --> 43:44.579
- Yeah, I guess I made some ink.
- And what ink.

43:44.664 --> 43:48.542
Come on, Eddie. Just let's go. Please!

43:51.963 --> 43:54.089
So tell me, Eddie.
Is that a rabbit in your pocket,

43:54.173 --> 43:56.008
or are you just happy to see me?

43:57.593 --> 44:00.220
Cut the comedy, Dolores.
I've had a very hard day.

44:01.055 --> 44:03.682
- I gotta get out of these cuffs.
- Oh, swell.

44:05.893 --> 44:08.812
Jeepers, Eddie,
that almost killed me!

44:09.981 --> 44:12.816
Boy, what is this?
Some kind of a secret room?

44:12.900 --> 44:15.444
It's a rotgut room.
A holdover from Prohibition.

44:15.528 --> 44:19.072
Oh, I get it. A speakeasy,
a gin mill, a hooch parlor.

44:19.157 --> 44:20.657
- Tools are up here, Eddie.
- Look at this!

44:20.742 --> 44:23.035
It's a spy hole!

44:23.119 --> 44:25.787
Jeepers, Eddie!
This would be a great place to hide!

44:28.041 --> 44:30.667
- Crazy Toon.
- Watch your head!

44:32.545 --> 44:34.838
I thought you said
you'd never take another Toon case.

44:34.922 --> 44:37.424
- What'd you have, a change of heart?
- Nothing's changed.

44:37.508 --> 44:40.552
Somebody's made a patsy out of me,
and I'm going to find out why.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.103
Hold still, will ya?

44:52.732 --> 44:55.442
- Does this help?
- Yeah. Thanks.

44:59.697 --> 45:00.697
You mean to tell me that

45:00.782 --> 45:03.142
you could have taken your hand
out of that cuff at any time?

45:03.201 --> 45:06.370
No, not at any time.
Only when it was funny.

45:06.454 --> 45:07.788
Get out!

45:07.872 --> 45:10.749
Come on, Eddie.
Where's your sense of humor?

45:10.833 --> 45:13.433
He always this funny, or only on days
when he's wanted for murder?

45:13.503 --> 45:15.545
Listen, my philosophy is this.

45:15.630 --> 45:18.799
If you don't have a good sense
of humor, you're better off dead.

45:18.883 --> 45:22.594
You just may get your wish unless
I can figure out what happened to this.

45:22.678 --> 45:25.263
- What is it, Eddie?
- Just look at it.

45:25.348 --> 45:28.225
- Mr. Acme's will.
- Yeah.

45:28.309 --> 45:30.394
And I think Maroon
played the part of sound mind

45:30.478 --> 45:31.895
and your wife the sound body.

45:31.979 --> 45:34.147
Why, I resent that innuendo!

45:34.232 --> 45:37.025
- What's the scheme, Eddie?
- I don't think they got to the will.

45:37.985 --> 45:38.944
But how do you know?

45:39.028 --> 45:41.613
Because they were still looking
for it after they killed him.

45:41.697 --> 45:42.989
Anything I can do?

45:43.074 --> 45:45.117
Maybe you can go downtown
and check the probate.

45:45.201 --> 45:47.536
Yeah, check the probate!

45:47.620 --> 45:50.914
Why, my Uncle Thumper
had a problem with his probate,

45:50.998 --> 45:55.127
and he had to take these big pills
and drink lots of water.

45:55.211 --> 45:59.756
- Not prostate, you idiot. Probate!
- Let me get this straight.

45:59.841 --> 46:02.509
You think that my boss, R. K. Maroon

46:02.593 --> 46:05.137
dropped a safe on Marvin Acme's head

46:05.221 --> 46:07.639
so that he could get
his hands on Toontown?

46:07.723 --> 46:09.599
Yeah.

46:09.684 --> 46:11.101
That's my hunch.

46:12.478 --> 46:15.814
Can he stay here
for a couple of days?

46:17.358 --> 46:19.192
He's not gonna do
anything crazy, is he?

46:25.741 --> 46:27.826
- Where are you going?
- Back to the office.

46:30.204 --> 46:33.748
Mr. Valiant. Mr. Valiant?

46:40.131 --> 46:42.799
You've got the wrong idea
about me, Mr. Valiant.

46:42.884 --> 46:45.510
I'm a pawn in this, just like Roger.

46:45.595 --> 46:50.807
Can you help me find him?
Just name your price and I'll pay it.

46:50.892 --> 46:52.726
Yeah, I bet you would.

46:54.061 --> 46:56.438
You've gotta have the rabbit
to make the scam work.

46:56.522 --> 47:00.442
No, no, no. I love my husband.
You've got me all wrong.

47:00.526 --> 47:03.945
You don't know how hard it is
being a woman

47:04.030 --> 47:06.031
looking the way I do.

47:06.574 --> 47:07.908
Yeah, well.

47:08.951 --> 47:11.578
You don't know how hard
it is being a man

47:12.246 --> 47:14.831
looking at a woman,
looking the way you do.

47:14.916 --> 47:18.460
I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.

47:23.341 --> 47:26.176
Weren't you the one I caught playing
patty-cake with old man Acme?

47:26.260 --> 47:30.514
You didn't catch me, Mr. Valiant.
You were set up to take those pictures.

47:30.598 --> 47:34.351
- What are you talking about?
- Maroon wanted to blackmail Acme.

47:34.435 --> 47:36.195
I didn't want to have anything
to do with it,

47:36.229 --> 47:39.231
but he said if I didn't
pose for those patty-cake pictures,

47:39.315 --> 47:41.858
Roger would never work
in this town again.

47:41.943 --> 47:43.401
I couldn't let that happen.

47:44.028 --> 47:47.113
I'd do anything
for my husband, Mr. Valiant.

47:47.615 --> 47:50.867
- Anything.
- What a wife.

47:50.952 --> 47:54.538
I'm desperate, Mr. Valiant.
Can't you see how much I need you?

47:54.622 --> 47:57.958
Dabblin' in watercolors, Eddie?

47:59.001 --> 48:01.086
Well.

48:03.047 --> 48:04.756
Sorry.

48:05.466 --> 48:08.635
Good-bye, Eddie. My offer stands firm.

48:09.136 --> 48:11.096
Think about it.

48:19.772 --> 48:21.273
Well!

48:22.692 --> 48:25.652
Do you want to tell me what she was
doing with her arms around you?

48:25.736 --> 48:28.238
Probably lookin' for
a good place to stick a knife.

48:28.322 --> 48:31.241
Come on, Eddie.
I caught you with your pants down!

48:31.325 --> 48:33.577
Yeah, but I... Dolores, come...

48:37.832 --> 48:38.873
Come on, Dolores.

48:38.958 --> 48:41.459
You don't believe a painted hussy
like that could turn my head.

48:41.544 --> 48:43.464
She's just trying to get
her hands on the rabbit.

48:43.546 --> 48:45.755
That's not all she's trying
to get her hands on.

48:45.840 --> 48:48.508
Now, look, Dolores, listen.
Listen to me.

48:48.593 --> 48:52.596
Look, I want you to go out, I want you
to buy yourself a new swim suit,

48:52.680 --> 48:54.514
'cause you and me
are going to Catalina.

48:54.599 --> 48:56.600
I'm on the verge
of wrappin' up this case.

48:56.684 --> 48:58.101
No, you're not, Eddie.

48:58.185 --> 49:02.105
That's what I came to tell you.
I stopped by Probate.

49:02.189 --> 49:05.191
Maroon's not after Toontown
like you thought.

49:05.276 --> 49:08.153
It's Cloverleaf that wants
to get their hands on Toontown.

49:08.237 --> 49:09.946
They put in the highest bid.

49:10.031 --> 49:13.116
And unless Mr. Acme's will
shows up by midnight tonight,

49:13.200 --> 49:15.702
Cloverleaf is gonna own Toontown.

49:15.786 --> 49:19.539
- What? At midnight tonight?
- That's right.

49:20.333 --> 49:23.877
First they buy the Red Car, then they
want to get their hands on Toontown.

49:25.713 --> 49:27.130
I don't get it.

49:27.214 --> 49:28.757
Yes!

49:29.008 --> 49:30.717
Roger!

49:34.555 --> 49:36.723
The rabbit. Get the judge.

49:37.058 --> 49:38.558
A joke don't sit there on your brain

49:38.643 --> 49:40.310
Nice shirt.

49:40.394 --> 49:43.730
Who's your tailor, Quasimodo?

49:43.814 --> 49:46.816
My buddy's Eddie V
A sourpuss, you'll see

49:46.901 --> 49:50.153
But when I'm done he'll need no gun
'cause a joker he will be

49:50.237 --> 49:52.322
C, D, E, F, G

49:52.406 --> 49:56.660
H, I... I would love
to raise some Cain

49:56.744 --> 49:59.663
Believe me, it's no strain
It feels so great 'cause I'm so tight

49:59.747 --> 50:01.665
And look, there is no pain

50:01.749 --> 50:03.667
No pain. No pain. No pain

50:04.877 --> 50:08.630
No pain. No pain. No...

50:11.300 --> 50:13.593
- No!
- Hey, wait!

50:14.929 --> 50:16.096
Yah!

50:17.348 --> 50:19.641
Hey, who turned out the lights?

50:19.725 --> 50:22.977
I can't see a thing! What's goin' on?

50:23.062 --> 50:24.646
You crazy rabbit!

50:24.730 --> 50:27.607
I've been out there risking my neck
for you, and what are you doin'?

50:27.692 --> 50:29.401
Singin' and dancin'!

50:31.904 --> 50:35.031
But I'm a Toon. Toons
are supposed to make people laugh.

50:35.116 --> 50:36.324
Sit down!

50:36.409 --> 50:39.703
You don't understand.
Those people needed to laugh.

50:39.787 --> 50:42.205
Yeah, and when they're done laughin',
they'll call the cops!

50:42.289 --> 50:44.582
That guy Angelo would
rat on you for a nickel.

50:44.667 --> 50:46.960
Not Angelo! He'd never turn me in.

50:47.044 --> 50:49.045
Why? Because you made him laugh?

50:49.130 --> 50:53.174
That's right.
A laugh can be a very powerful thing.

50:53.259 --> 50:56.970
Why, sometimes in life,
it's the only weapon we have.

50:57.471 --> 50:58.763
Laughter is the most...

50:58.848 --> 51:02.308
"Ixnay." "Ix-nay."

51:09.066 --> 51:11.484
I'm looking for a murderer.

51:23.956 --> 51:25.540
A rabbit.

51:28.419 --> 51:30.295
A Toon rabbit.

51:31.088 --> 51:34.674
About yea big.

51:35.468 --> 51:36.551
Look.

51:37.344 --> 51:40.972
There's no rabbit here,
so don't harass my customers.

51:41.056 --> 51:45.268
I didn't come here to harass.
I came here to reward.

52:20.846 --> 52:23.765
Hey. I seen a rabbit.

52:26.060 --> 52:27.143
Where?

52:27.228 --> 52:28.770
See?

52:35.236 --> 52:38.488
- Where?
- He's right here in the bar.

52:45.454 --> 52:47.747
Say "hello," Harvey.

52:53.879 --> 52:56.256
I told you so.

53:18.487 --> 53:22.448
The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down.

53:23.033 --> 53:27.537
Quite a loony selection
for a group of drunken reprobates.

53:34.795 --> 53:35.962
He's here!

53:40.593 --> 53:42.927
Stop that laughing!

53:48.142 --> 53:50.268
Have you forgotten
what happened last time?

53:50.352 --> 53:53.229
If you don't stop this laughing,
you're gonna end up dead,

53:53.314 --> 53:55.899
just like your idiot hyena cousins!

53:55.983 --> 54:00.111
Say, boss, you want we should
"disresemble" the place?

54:00.195 --> 54:05.992
No, Sergeant. Disassembling
the place won't be necessary.

54:06.118 --> 54:10.288
The rabbit is going to come right to me.

54:14.251 --> 54:19.464
No Toon can resist
the old Shave and a Haircut trick.

54:27.264 --> 54:29.807
I don't know who's toonier,
you or Doom.

54:31.477 --> 54:33.061
Roger!

54:35.898 --> 54:37.607
Ro... Roger.

54:38.984 --> 54:41.402
Roger, no!

54:44.531 --> 54:46.491
Roger, don't...

54:49.036 --> 54:52.080
Shave and a haircut

54:54.166 --> 54:55.959
Two bits

55:00.255 --> 55:05.051
Hey, Judge, what should we do
with the wallflower?

55:05.135 --> 55:06.970
We'll see to him later.

55:07.054 --> 55:11.557
Right now I feel like
dispensing some justice.

55:12.518 --> 55:13.768
Bring me some dip.

55:19.900 --> 55:23.778
Does the condemned have anything to
say before his sentence is carried out?

55:24.196 --> 55:27.573
Why, yeah. I...

55:30.661 --> 55:33.913
Dolores, a bourbon,
and make it a double.

55:34.415 --> 55:36.165
A fine time for a drink, Eddie.

55:36.250 --> 55:38.126
Maybe you'd like a bowl
of pretzels to go with it!

55:38.210 --> 55:39.919
Pour the drink, Dolores.

55:46.260 --> 55:47.760
Hey, Judge!

55:48.887 --> 55:51.139
Doesn't a dying rabbit
deserve a last request?

55:51.223 --> 55:53.891
Yeah! Nose plugs would be nice.

55:53.976 --> 55:56.436
I think you want a drink.

55:58.480 --> 56:01.816
- How 'bout it, Judge?
- Well, why not.

56:01.900 --> 56:05.194
I don't mind prolonging the execution.

56:05.279 --> 56:06.279
Happy trails.

56:06.363 --> 56:08.614
No, thanks, Eddie.
I'm tryin' to cut down.

56:08.699 --> 56:10.700
- Drink the drink!
- But I don't want the drink.

56:10.784 --> 56:11.826
He doesn't want the drink.

56:11.910 --> 56:13.286
- He does! You do!
- I don't!

56:13.370 --> 56:14.662
- I don't! I don't!
- You do!

56:14.747 --> 56:16.539
- You do! You don't.
- I don't!

56:16.623 --> 56:19.500
- I do!
- You don't!

56:19.585 --> 56:22.879
Listen, when I say "I do,"
that means I do!

56:46.320 --> 56:47.320
Come on.

57:02.920 --> 57:04.170
Gotcha, kid.

57:08.884 --> 57:11.427
Come on, Eddie, let's get out of here!

57:11.512 --> 57:13.805
Move it, pops! Yikes!

57:15.432 --> 57:18.684
That was quick thinkin', Eddie.
Nothing like using the old spine flower,

57:18.769 --> 57:20.978
- the wise noodle, the smart puddin'.
- Roger!

57:21.063 --> 57:23.022
- Yikes! Stop, will ya?
- Let's use this!

57:23.107 --> 57:24.107
Yah!

57:24.191 --> 57:25.900
Let's get out of here!
What are you waitin' for?

57:25.984 --> 57:27.026
There's no damn key!

57:27.111 --> 57:30.113
Hey, you weasels, let me out of here,
will ya? Come on!

57:30.197 --> 57:33.825
- I've got to make a livin'!
- Benny, is that you?

57:33.909 --> 57:38.538
No, it's Eleanor Roosevelt.
Come on, Roger! Get me out of here!

57:38.622 --> 57:42.667
Eddie, we got ourselves a ride!
Open the doors!

57:48.048 --> 57:50.800
That's better.

57:50.884 --> 57:53.970
I can't believe they locked me up
for driving on the sidewalk.

57:54.054 --> 57:56.139
Come on, Eddie. Get in!

57:56.223 --> 57:58.891
- It was just a couple of miles.
- I'll drive!

57:58.976 --> 58:01.644
- But I wanna drive!
- No, I'll drive!

58:01.728 --> 58:05.314
I'm the cab. Out of my way, pencil neck!

58:05.399 --> 58:07.483
How about this weather?

58:07.776 --> 58:10.820
- It never rains!
- Would you beat it!

58:10.904 --> 58:12.989
They've sprung the cab! Let's go!

58:13.073 --> 58:15.324
And how about those
Brooklyn Dodgers?

58:15.409 --> 58:16.701
Are they bums, or what?

58:17.077 --> 58:18.744
Move over. I'm drivin'!

58:21.456 --> 58:23.499
Benny, Eddie, we got company!

58:23.584 --> 58:26.043
Will you look at these two?
Excuse me, ladies!

58:27.713 --> 58:29.672
Now that's what I call
a couple of road hogs.

58:31.049 --> 58:35.344
- I'm gonna blow his head off.
- Benny, look out for the Red Car!

58:44.771 --> 58:47.565
Benny,
there's cops right behind us!

58:47.649 --> 58:50.401
Not for long, Roger.

58:50.777 --> 58:53.446
- No!
- Now they're right in front of us.

58:55.073 --> 58:57.450
Eddie, we're goin' backwards.
Turn us around.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.452
Give me the wheel. Give me the wheel!

59:03.540 --> 59:06.500
- The cops are still on our tail!
- I know the cops are on our tail!

59:06.585 --> 59:08.211
What do you think I am? Benny!

59:08.295 --> 59:10.421
No. No!

59:10.505 --> 59:12.965
Pull the lever!

59:13.050 --> 59:14.634
- Which one?
- Which one?

59:14.718 --> 59:17.303
Which one?

59:17.387 --> 59:18.763
I'm gonna ram 'em.

59:20.390 --> 59:21.974
What the heck?

59:25.479 --> 59:27.480
I'm gettin' too old for this!

59:34.863 --> 59:36.405
Jumpin' jeepers!

59:36.490 --> 59:38.908
Hey, Roger, what do you call
the middle of a song?

59:38.992 --> 59:40.993
I don't know. A bridge!

59:44.373 --> 59:47.583
- Well, fellas, where can I drop ya?
- Yeah. Somewhere we can hide.

59:47.668 --> 59:50.586
I got just the place. And incidentally,

59:50.671 --> 59:54.006
if you should ever need a ride,
just stick out your thumb.

59:54.091 --> 59:56.634
Hey, share the road, will ya, lady?

59:58.428 --> 01:00:01.347
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:20.116
Boy, did you see that?
Nobody takes a wallop like Goofy.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.703
What timing, what finesse!
What a genius!

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:26.706
Ouch!

01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:30.459
We're supposed to be hiding.
What's wrong with you?

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:32.628
What's wrong with you?

01:00:32.713 --> 01:00:35.464
You're the only person
in this theater that isn't laughing.

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:39.051
Is there nothing that can permeate
your impervious puss?

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:43.139
Hey, Eddie! Boy, nothin'.

01:00:43.223 --> 01:00:48.185
What could've possibly happened to
you to turn you into such a sourpuss?

01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:51.439
You want to know? I'll tell you.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.900
- A Toon killed my brother.
- A Toon? No.

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:58.696
That's right. A Toon.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:02.325
We were investigating a robbery at
the First National Bank of Toontown.

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:06.287
Back in those days, me and Teddy
liked working Toontown.

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:08.247
We thought it was a lot of laughs.

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:12.251
Anyway, this guy

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:16.130
got away with a zillion simoleons.

01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:22.094
We trailed him to a little dive
down on Yockster Street.

01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:25.097
We went in.

01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:30.227
Only he got the drop on us, literally.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.982
Dropped a piano on us from 15 stories.

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:37.985
Broke my arm.

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:41.113
Teddy never made it.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.742
I never did find out who that guy was.

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:47.078
All I remember was,

01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:49.914
he was standin' over me, laughin',

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:53.209
with those burnin' red eyes

01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:55.503
and that high, squeaky voice.

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:00.383
He disappeared
into Toontown after that.

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:05.721
No wonder you hate me.

01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:09.975
If a Toon killed my brother,
I'd hate me too!

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:13.187
Come on, don't cry. I don't hate you.

01:02:13.271 --> 01:02:15.356
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.732
You do hate me.

01:02:16.817 --> 01:02:20.444
Otherwise you wouldn't have
yanked my ears all those times.

01:02:20.529 --> 01:02:23.406
Well, I'm sorry I yanked your ears.

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:26.117
All the times you yanked my ears?

01:02:27.119 --> 01:02:30.663
- All the times I yanked your ears.
- Apology accepted.

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:34.792
Put 'er there, pal. I feel better. Oh, boy!

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:36.669
I hope it's another cartoon!

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:40.548
Jeepers, another stupid newsreel.

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:43.008
I hate the news.

01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:47.138
- Did you get all my stuff?
- Yes.

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:50.307
It's all packed up in the car outside.

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:54.728
Would have been here right after you
called, but I had to shake the weasels.

01:02:55.564 --> 01:02:59.567
Yeah. I'm sorry about
the trouble in the bar.

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:04.196
Oh, hell. Stuffing olives
for a living wasn't for me anyway.

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:07.032
Dolores?

01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:13.789
You oughta find yourself a good man.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:18.752
But I already have a good man.

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:28.679
P-p-please, don't mind me.

01:03:32.184 --> 01:03:33.305
You better get going, Eddie.

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:40.608
A near miss, but this
miss says that's as good as a smile.

01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:43.360
California Cloverleaf...

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:45.571
Glad Teddy's not here
to see me running away

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.156
with my tail between my legs.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.534
It's not so bad
once you get used to it.

01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:53.162
The Pacific Red Car trolley line

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:56.415
and the venerated
Maroon Cartoon Studios.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:59.335
Here, R.K. Maroon is seen
clinching the deal

01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:01.378
with Cloverleaf's bankers and execs

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:05.799
in one of the biggest real estate deals
ever in California history.

01:04:05.884 --> 01:04:07.844
- That's it!
- Three-and-a-half million dollars...

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:10.095
That's the connection!

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:21.732
Let's forget it.
There's nobody here.

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:25.611
- Is that it, or are you scared?
- P-p-please! Me, scared?

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.488
Don't be ridiculous.

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:32.785
When you called Maroon, you told him
you had the will, but you don't.

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:35.287
When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:37.540
He might try to kill ya.

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:41.377
I can handle a Hollywood cream puff.
I just don't want the odds to change.

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:43.212
Now, you cover my back.

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:47.049
And if you hear or see anything,
beep the horn twice.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:50.553
Yeah, that's it. Beep the horn twice.
Cover your back.

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:55.474
Boy, I'm ready. Dukes up,
eyes peeled, ears to the ground.

01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:58.769
Why, nobody gets the drop
on Roger Rabbit.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.751
What's up, Doc?

01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:25.004
Valiant, what are you trying to do,
give me a heart attack?

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:27.381
You need a heart
before you can have an attack.

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:29.842
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got the will?

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:32.970
Sure. I got the will.

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:37.433
The question is, do you have the way?

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:40.102
'Cause I can tell you now,
it ain't gonna come cheap.

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:43.105
You got a lot of brass
coming up here by yourself.

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:44.857
Who said I'm here by myself?

01:05:57.078 --> 01:05:59.038
Let me see that will.

01:05:59.247 --> 01:06:01.498
- I told you, I got it.
- I want to see it now!

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:10.299
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways"?

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:13.344
- This supposed to be a joke?
- No, this is.

01:06:18.266 --> 01:06:20.059
Get up! Come on.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:22.227
What are you gonna
do to me, Valiant?

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:26.440
I'm gonna listen to you
spin the Cloverleaf scenario.

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:31.070
A story of greed, sex and murder.

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:34.740
And the parts that I don't like,
I'm gonna edit out.

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:37.951
You got it all wrong!
I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer!

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:40.913
Everybody's got to have a hobby.

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:44.583
Oh, stop it. Stop it! Stop it!

01:06:45.085 --> 01:06:48.087
The truth is, I had a chance
to sell my studio,

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:51.298
but Cloverleaf wouldn't buy my property
unless Acme sold them his.

01:06:51.383 --> 01:06:53.092
The stubborn bastard wouldn't sell,

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:56.595
so I was gonna blackmail Acme with
pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:00.265
Blackmail, that's all!
I've been around Toons all my life!

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:04.436
- I didn't want to see 'em destroyed!
- Toons destroyed? Why?

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:07.481
- If I tell ya, I'm a dead man.
- You're a dead man if you don't tell me.

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:11.110
Unless Acme's will shows
by midnight tonight,

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:14.446
Toontown's going to be
live for the free...

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:40.639
Roger!

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:49.041
- What the...
- Yeah, what in Sam Hill...

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:53.127
Eddie Valiant!
Well, you're a sight for sore eyes!

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:55.964
I ain't seen you in nigh on to five years.

01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:58.634
- Where've you been?
- Drunk.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:03.514
- You feeling frisky tonight, fellas?
- Yeah!

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:06.850
Let's go.

01:09:06.935 --> 01:09:09.269
Yahoo!

01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:11.123
Smile, darn ya, smile

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:16.420
You know, this old world
is a great world after all

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:20.340
Smile, darn ya, smile

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:25.387
And right away watch lady luck
pay you a call

01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:30.225
Things are never black
as they are painted

01:10:30.685 --> 01:10:33.437
Time for you and joy to get acquainted

01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:34.771
Hi, Eddie!

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:38.650
Hi, Eddie! Hi, Eddie! Bye, Eddie!

01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:54.458
Tallyho! Tallyho!

01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:06.094
Get out of here!

01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:19.733
Going up, sir.

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:23.028
Yah!

01:11:24.489 --> 01:11:26.239
Mind the step, sir.

01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:29.743
Hold on, sir.

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:32.871
Yah!

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:40.212
Your floor, sir.

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:44.675
Have a good day, sir.

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:50.681
Gotcha.

01:11:54.894 --> 01:11:57.396
A man!

01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:08.615
Lover boy! It's Lena Hyena!

01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:17.541
Oh, no!

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:29.344
- Oh, "wook," piggies.
- Hi, Tweety.

01:12:29.429 --> 01:12:33.223
This "wittle" piggy went to market.
This "wittle" piggy stayed home.

01:12:33.307 --> 01:12:35.767
- No.
- This "wittle" piggy had roast beef.

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:39.229
And this "wittle" piggy had...

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:41.398
Ran out of piggies.

01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:44.443
Yah!

01:12:46.654 --> 01:12:50.907
What's up, Doc? Jumpin' without
a parachute? Kinda dangerous, ain't it?

01:12:50.992 --> 01:12:52.075
Yeah.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.493
Yeah. You could get killed.

01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:56.997
- You guys got a spare?
- Bugs does.

01:12:57.081 --> 01:12:59.124
- Yeah?
- Yeah, but I don't think you want it.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:02.669
- I do! I do! Give it to me!
- Better let him have it, Bugs.

01:13:02.754 --> 01:13:06.465
Okay, Doc. Whatever you say.
Here's the spare.

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:08.091
Thank you.

01:13:10.762 --> 01:13:13.138
No!

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:16.975
- Poor fella.
- Yeah. Ain't I a stinker?

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:23.482
My man!

01:13:27.779 --> 01:13:29.654
Come to Lena!

01:13:37.205 --> 01:13:39.498
Toons. Gets 'em every time.

01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:59.226
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.

01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:02.521
Valiant?

01:14:07.735 --> 01:14:10.028
I always knew I'd get it in Toontown.

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:12.447
Behind you!

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:15.158
Drop it, lady!

01:14:15.243 --> 01:14:17.202
I just saved your life,
and you still don't trust me?

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:20.539
- I don't trust anybody or anything!
- Not even your own eyes?

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:25.168
That's the gun that killed R. K. Maroon,
and Doom pulled the trigger.

01:14:25.253 --> 01:14:27.379
- Doom?
- I followed him to the studio,

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.089
but I was too late to stop him.

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:31.633
That's right!
You'll never stop me!

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:34.553
- You're dead! You're both dead!
- Doom!

01:14:37.557 --> 01:14:39.724
- Which way'd he go?
- Well, I don't know.

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:43.562
- Well, he went that-a-way.
- Let's go!

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.021
Dum-dums.

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:46.565
- Come on.
- Yeah.

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:50.944
- Oh, no. Where's Roger?
- Roger?

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:52.737
He chickened out on me
back at the studio.

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:53.864
No, he didn't.

01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:56.158
I hit him on the head with a frying pan
and put him in the trunk

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:57.701
so he wouldn't get hurt.

01:14:57.785 --> 01:14:59.035
Makes perfect sense.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.912
We're obviously not
going anywhere in my car.

01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:02.080
Let's take yours.

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:07.085
I got a feeling somebody already did.

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.087
From the looks of it,
I'd say it was Roger.

01:15:09.172 --> 01:15:12.132
My honey bunny was never
very good behind the wheel.

01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:14.926
- A better lover than a driver?
- You'd better believe it, buster.

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:18.013
It's the weasels. This way!

01:15:18.097 --> 01:15:20.057
- We'll take Gingerbread Lane.
- No, wait! No, no!

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:23.185
Gingerbread Lane's this way.

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:25.770
So, Valiant, you call a cab, or what?

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:29.524
Hubba-hubba-hubba.
Allow me, mademoiselle.

01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:34.446
So how long have you
known it was Doom?

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:37.532
Before poor Marvin Acme was killed,
he confided in me

01:15:37.617 --> 01:15:40.035
that Doom wanted
to get his hands on Toontown,

01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:41.453
and he wouldn't stop at anything.

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:43.098
So he gave you the will
for safekeeping.

01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:44.247
That's what he told me.

01:15:44.332 --> 01:15:45.540
Except when I opened the envelope,

01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:47.709
there was only
a blank piece of paper inside.

01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:51.004
- A joker to the end.
- So where to, already?

01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:53.673
- My meter's runnin'!
- I have to find my darling husband.

01:15:53.758 --> 01:15:55.217
I'm so worried about him.

01:15:55.301 --> 01:15:57.886
Seriously, what do you see in that guy?

01:15:57.970 --> 01:15:59.304
He makes me laugh.

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:13.568
I've been dipped!

01:16:20.284 --> 01:16:24.663
What an unfortunate accident. Nothing
more treacherous than a slippery road

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:28.333
especially when driving
in a maniacal Toon vehicle.

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:33.588
Good work, boss.

01:16:33.673 --> 01:16:35.924
Don't just stand there. Help them.

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:38.385
- Put them in my car.
- Follow me.

01:16:38.469 --> 01:16:42.138
And I think they'll enjoy attending
the ribbon cutting at the Acme Factory.

01:16:42.223 --> 01:16:44.099
Come on, you mugs.

01:16:57.154 --> 01:17:00.824
We searched Valiant, boss.
The will ain't on him.

01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:05.370
- Then frisk the woman!
- I'll handle this one.

01:17:11.043 --> 01:17:13.878
Nice booby trap.

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:23.930
Do they have the will, or not?

01:17:24.015 --> 01:17:26.891
- Nah, just a stupid love letter.
- No matter.

01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:30.937
I doubt if that will is gonna show up
in the next 15 minutes anyway.

01:17:32.023 --> 01:17:35.483
- What happens in the next 15 minutes?
- Toontown will be legally mine.

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:37.694
Lock, stock and barrel.

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:45.702
Benny, is that you?

01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:50.540
No, it's Shirley Temple!

01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:52.459
Jumpin' jeepers! What happened?

01:17:52.543 --> 01:17:56.504
Doom grabbed your wife and Valiant
and took 'em to the Acme Factory.

01:17:56.589 --> 01:17:59.299
The Acme Factory?
I know where that is. Get in!

01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:02.510
Move over, Rog. You've done
enough driving for one night.

01:18:04.472 --> 01:18:06.765
Toontown right on
the other side of the wall, boss.

01:18:08.225 --> 01:18:11.519
You see, Mr. Valiant,
the successful conclusion of this case

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:15.648
draws the curtains on my career
as a jurist in Toontown.

01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:19.486
I'm retiring to take a new role
in the private sector.

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:22.197
That wouldn't be Cloverleaf
Industries by any chance?

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:25.950
You're looking at the sole stockholder.

01:18:30.247 --> 01:18:33.958
Benny, you go for the cops.
I'm gonna save my wife.

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:37.754
Be careful with that gun.
This ain't no cartoon, you know.

01:18:38.172 --> 01:18:39.839
This is no way to make a livin'.

01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:44.469
Wouldn't you know. Locked.

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:56.981
Can you guess what this is?

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:03.613
Oh, my God! It's dip!

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:08.326
That's right, my dear. Enough to dip
Toontown off the face of the Earth!

01:19:11.622 --> 01:19:13.540
A vehicle of my own design.

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:17.544
5,000 gallons of heated dip

01:19:17.628 --> 01:19:21.714
pumped at enormous velocity
through a pressurized water cannon.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:26.302
Toontown will be erased
in a matter of minutes.

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:30.265
I suppose you think

01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:32.725
no one's going to notice
Toontown's disappeared?

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:34.144
Who's got time to wonder
what happened

01:19:34.228 --> 01:19:35.728
to some ridiculous talking mice

01:19:35.813 --> 01:19:38.773
when you're driving by
at 75 miles an hour?

01:19:38.858 --> 01:19:41.985
What are you talking about?
There's no road past Toontown.

01:19:42.069 --> 01:19:44.446
Not yet! Several months ago,

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:48.992
I had the good providence to stumble
upon this plan of the city council's.

01:19:49.076 --> 01:19:52.370
A construction plan of epic proportions.

01:19:52.455 --> 01:19:55.748
They're calling it a freeway.

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:59.294
Freeway? What the hell's a freeway?

01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:03.339
Eight lanes of shimmering cement
running from here to Pasadena.

01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:05.884
Smooth, safe, fast.

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:08.803
Traffic jams will be a thing of the past.

01:20:08.888 --> 01:20:12.640
So that's why you killed
Acme and Maroon? For this freeway?

01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:16.561
- I don't get it.
- Of course not. You lack vision.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:21.232
I see a place where people
get on and off the freeway.

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:25.737
On and off, off and on,
all day and all night!

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:31.618
Soon, where Toontown once stood
will be a string of gas stations,

01:20:31.702 --> 01:20:36.956
inexpensive motels, restaurants
that serve rapidly prepared food,

01:20:37.041 --> 01:20:41.628
tire salons, automobile dealerships,

01:20:41.712 --> 01:20:45.298
and wonderful, wonderful billboards

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:48.718
reaching as far as the eye can see!

01:20:50.304 --> 01:20:54.933
- My God, it'll be beautiful.
- Come on!

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:57.727
Nobody's gonna
drive this lousy freeway

01:20:57.811 --> 01:20:59.687
when they can take
the Red Car for a nickel.

01:20:59.772 --> 01:21:02.482
Oh, they'll drive. They'll have to.

01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:07.278
You see, I bought the Red Car
so I could dismantle it.

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:09.989
What the...

01:21:15.162 --> 01:21:19.999
Ay, caramba!

01:21:20.084 --> 01:21:21.918
Okay, nobody move!

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:25.004
All right, weasels, grab some sky
or I'll let the judge have it!

01:21:25.089 --> 01:21:28.007
- You heard me. I said, drop it.
- Roger, darling!

01:21:28.092 --> 01:21:30.593
Yes, it's me, my dearest.
I'd love to embrace you,

01:21:30.678 --> 01:21:33.680
but first I have to satisfy
my sense of moral outrage!

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:36.724
Put the gun down,
you bucktoothed fool!

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:40.353
That's it, Doom! Give me another
excuse to pump you full of lead!

01:21:40.437 --> 01:21:42.564
You thought you could
get away with it, didn't ya?

01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:46.442
We Toons may act idiotic,
but we're not stupid!

01:21:46.527 --> 01:21:49.070
We demand justice,
but the real meaning of the word

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:51.948
probably hits you like a ton of bricks!

01:21:53.993 --> 01:21:55.493
Roger!

01:21:56.370 --> 01:22:00.373
- Roger, say something!
- Look, stars!

01:22:00.708 --> 01:22:03.459
Ready when you are, Raoul.

01:22:03.627 --> 01:22:05.295
Tie the lovebirds together.

01:22:10.843 --> 01:22:14.053
Come on, lovebirds. What you want?

01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:18.433
Put them up on that hook.
Use that escape-proof Toon rope.

01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:21.102
Time to kill the rabbit.

01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:28.526
Oh, Roger, you were magnificent.

01:22:28.611 --> 01:22:31.321
- Was I really?
- Better than Goofy.

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:47.128
Roger, darling,
I want you to know I love you.

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:50.632
I've loved you more than
any woman's ever loved a rabbit.

01:22:53.218 --> 01:22:54.886
It's over, Mr. Valiant.

01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:14.489
- Look out, you fools!
- Not so fast.

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:18.826
One of these days, you idiots
are gonna laugh yourselves to death!

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:25.583
Shall I "repose" of him right now, boss?

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:29.921
Let him watch his Toon friends
get dipped, then shoot him.

01:23:32.299 --> 01:23:34.133
With pleasure.

01:23:40.808 --> 01:23:43.017
Everything's funny to you,
ain't it, needle nose?

01:23:43.102 --> 01:23:47.063
You got a problem with that, Valiant?

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:48.856
Nah.

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:52.777
I just want you to know something
about the guy you're gonna dip!

01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:02.912
Now Roger is his name
Laughter is his game

01:24:02.996 --> 01:24:05.915
Come on, you dope, untie his rope
and watch him go insane

01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:20.513
- He's lost his mind.
- I don't think so.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:27.520
This singing ain't my line
It's tough to make a rhyme

01:24:27.604 --> 01:24:30.815
If I get stuck
I'm... I'm out of luck...

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:33.484
- I'm running out of time!
- Thanks!

01:25:02.055 --> 01:25:04.849
Hey, Eddie, keep it up!
You're killin' 'em!

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:07.685
You're slayin' 'em!
You're knockin' 'em dead!

01:25:15.486 --> 01:25:18.446
I'm through with taking falls
I'm bouncing off the walls

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:20.865
Without that gun I'd have some fun
I'd kick you in the...

01:25:21.992 --> 01:25:26.245
- Nose!
- Nose? That don't rhyme with "walls"!

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:27.997
No, but this does!

01:25:46.725 --> 01:25:49.352
Yikes! Oh, my goodness!

01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:53.606
Jeepers, that was close!

01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:02.406
Bye-bye!

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:05.535
Eddie, hurry! It's coming back!

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:24.554
- Oh, no!
- This is it!

01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:27.557
This isn't it!

01:26:43.574 --> 01:26:45.825
Wicked witchcraft

01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:51.205
And although I know

01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:55.793
It's strictly taboo

01:26:57.170 --> 01:26:58.671
When...

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:23.696
Don't move.

01:27:26.867 --> 01:27:28.618
No. No!

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:09.867
Yah!

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:34.058
Oh, no!

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:41.941
Come on, Eddie! Quit playing around!

01:28:43.402 --> 01:28:45.695
- P-p-please!
- Help!

01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:50.908
I wasn't worried. Were you?

01:29:11.138 --> 01:29:12.304
- Hey, look!
- Hey, look!

01:29:28.613 --> 01:29:30.531
Holy smoke! He's a Toon!

01:29:31.575 --> 01:29:33.576
- Surprised?
- Not really.

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:37.621
That lamebrain freeway idea
could only be cooked up by a Toon.

01:29:38.457 --> 01:29:40.708
Not just any Toon!

01:29:57.642 --> 01:30:00.269
Remember me, Eddie?

01:30:01.104 --> 01:30:04.190
When I killed your brother, I talked

01:30:04.274 --> 01:30:07.276
just like this!

01:30:14.826 --> 01:30:18.454
Jumpin' jeepers.

01:30:24.503 --> 01:30:27.046
Oh, my goodness! Oh, no!

01:31:30.694 --> 01:31:32.736
Good-bye, my darling. Good-bye!

01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:42.204
I think I'm gonna faint.

01:31:49.045 --> 01:31:50.421
Oh, no!

01:31:54.217 --> 01:31:56.302
I'm melting!

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:04.435
I'm melting! Melting!

01:32:15.655 --> 01:32:18.616
Eddie! Do something!

01:32:18.825 --> 01:32:20.868
Hurry up, Eddie!

01:32:21.411 --> 01:32:23.412
Do something!

01:32:56.196 --> 01:33:00.324
Eddie, there's dip everywhere!
How are we gonna get down?

01:33:26.518 --> 01:33:28.852
Jeepers, Eddie, that was a close shave.

01:33:28.937 --> 01:33:31.522
I thought for sure
our goose was cooked!

01:33:34.526 --> 01:33:36.110
My hero.

01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:39.571
- Oh, honey bunny.
- Oh, love cup.

01:33:41.533 --> 01:33:45.327
Oh, Roger, you were
a pillar of strength.

01:33:49.666 --> 01:33:53.836
Sister Mary Francis!
What the hell happened in here?

01:33:57.716 --> 01:34:00.384
I've been a cab for 37 years

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:02.386
and I've never seen a mess like this!

01:34:03.888 --> 01:34:05.139
What was that, a rubber mask?

01:34:05.223 --> 01:34:06.307
Yeah.

01:34:06.391 --> 01:34:09.852
And this is the rope from the safe
that was dropped on Acme.

01:34:09.936 --> 01:34:13.605
I think your lab boys will find
that paint's a perfect match.

01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:16.900
- Judge Doom killed Marvin Acme.
- And R. K. Maroon.

01:34:16.985 --> 01:34:18.444
And my brother.

01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:21.947
That's what I call one
seriously disturbed Toon.

01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:31.749
I wonder who he really was.

01:34:31.833 --> 01:34:34.835
I'll tell you one thing, Doc.
He weren't no rabbit.

01:34:34.919 --> 01:34:36.754
- Or a duck.
- Or a dog.

01:34:36.838 --> 01:34:38.505
- Or a little wooden boy.
- Or a sheep.

01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:39.840
- Or a woodpecker.
- Or a pussy.

01:34:42.052 --> 01:34:44.386
- What's that? What is that?
- It's ink.

01:34:45.055 --> 01:34:47.765
That goof Acme squirted me
with some the other night.

01:34:47.849 --> 01:34:51.060
- Why it's coming out now, I don't know.
- Here's your answer, Eddie.

01:34:51.144 --> 01:34:53.729
Acme Disappearing Reappearing Ink.

01:34:53.813 --> 01:34:57.858
- Boy, that Acme. What a genius!
- Applesauce!

01:34:57.942 --> 01:35:01.653
If he was such a genius, why didn't he
leave his will where we could find it?

01:35:01.738 --> 01:35:04.499
Without it, we're just waitin'
for another developer's wrecking ball!

01:35:04.574 --> 01:35:05.574
- Roger.
- Yeah?

01:35:05.658 --> 01:35:08.535
That love letter you wrote to your wife
in the Ink and Paint Club.

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:10.037
Why don't you read it to her now?

01:35:10.121 --> 01:35:13.957
Sure, Eddie.
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?"

01:35:14.042 --> 01:35:19.213
"Let me count the ways. I, Marvin Acme,
of sound mind and body..."

01:35:19.297 --> 01:35:21.048
- It's the will!
- Give me!

01:35:21.132 --> 01:35:23.550
"Do hereby bequeath in perpetuity"

01:35:23.635 --> 01:35:25.511
"the property known as Toontown"

01:35:25.595 --> 01:35:28.055
"to those lovable characters,
the Toons!"

01:35:40.276 --> 01:35:44.071
Hey, Eddie, that was a pretty
funny dance you did for the weasels.

01:35:44.406 --> 01:35:46.990
Do you think your days
of being a sourpuss are over?

01:35:47.492 --> 01:35:51.078
- Only time will tell.
- Yeah. Well, put it there, pal.

01:35:51.162 --> 01:35:52.204
Yeah.

01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:04.758
Don't tell me you lost
your sense of humor already.

01:36:08.471 --> 01:36:10.013
Does this answer your question?

01:36:12.934 --> 01:36:16.645
Blech! Bleah!

01:36:17.021 --> 01:36:18.522
Come on, Roger, let's go home.

01:36:19.107 --> 01:36:20.774
I'll bake you a carrot cake.

01:36:23.194 --> 01:36:27.072
Smile, darn ya, smile

01:36:27.157 --> 01:36:32.453
You know, this old world
is a great world after all

01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:36.206
Smile, darn ya, smile

01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:41.170
And right away watch lady luck
pay you a call

01:36:41.713 --> 01:36:46.133
Things are never black
as they are painted

01:36:46.217 --> 01:36:49.553
Time for you and joy
to get acquainted

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:52.806
Okay, m-m-move along.
T-T-There's nothing else to see.

01:36:52.891 --> 01:36:54.391
That's all, folks.

01:36:54.559 --> 01:36:56.602
I like the sound of that.

01:36:57.479 --> 01:37:00.022
T-T-T-T-That's all, folks!
