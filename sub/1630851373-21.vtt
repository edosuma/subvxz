- No.
- Yeah.

12:57.211 --> 13:01.737
Hey, is it just me or you
seem happier this shift?

13:01.781 --> 13:04.131
I think we turned a corner.

13:04.174 --> 13:07.743
Figured it was
only a matter of time.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.919
Oh, hey, look at you.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.051
You don't see a lot of floaters

13:11.094 --> 13:12.704
putting up pictures
in their locker.

13:12.748 --> 13:15.882
I'm permanent and I'm still
way too superstitious for that.

13:15.925 --> 13:18.319
Like, the moment
I get too comfortable...

13:18.362 --> 13:19.799
boom.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.931
Somebody'll find a reason
to snatch me up out of here.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.280
A lot of people
think that way,

13:23.324 --> 13:25.935
but I think
they got it backwards.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.371
If you ask me, it's all about

13:27.415 --> 13:29.634
manifesting what you want, Mason.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.332
I really believe that.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.860
Yeah, it started last night.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.949
It's not bad, but we should
probably bring her in

13:39.993 --> 13:41.864
for service within
the next week or so.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.387
I mean, it's no big deal.

13:43.431 --> 13:45.172
Just because
you were my best man,

13:45.215 --> 13:47.087
I wasn't expecting to be
your best man or anything.

13:47.130 --> 13:50.090
It's cool.
- Is it?

13:50.133 --> 13:51.482
Yeah, yeah, totally.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.789
I'm just saying, I'm here
for you anyway, you know?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.530
Sort of like a second best man.

13:55.573 --> 13:58.272
In case there's any best man
duties that Casey can't fulfill

13:58.315 --> 14:02.319
because he doesn't live here
and I do.

14:02.363 --> 14:05.235
We'll see about all that
wedding stuff and who knows.

14:05.279 --> 14:09.239
Who knows?
About the wedding?

14:09.283 --> 14:11.154
It's a long way off,
that's all.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.900
Hey, isn't that
the food truck guy?

14:17.944 --> 14:20.424
- Hey, it's Dell, right?
- Yeah.

14:20.468 --> 14:21.599
Hey, how's it going there,
Chef?

14:21.643 --> 14:23.340
No shortness of breath,
right?

14:23.384 --> 14:24.602
It feels like
I have a chest cold,

14:24.646 --> 14:26.082
but, you know, I'm okay.

14:26.126 --> 14:27.736
Yeah, I'm surprised
Med discharged you this soon.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.651
These look like
second-degree burns.

14:29.694 --> 14:32.088
That's what they said,
but I can't really afford

14:32.132 --> 14:34.482
a whole, big
medical situation right now.

14:34.525 --> 14:35.657
Well, that bandage is loose.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.963
You gotta keep
those burns covered.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.486
There's a high risk
of you getting...

14:38.529 --> 14:40.618
Listen, I don't want to
take up too much of your time.

14:40.662 --> 14:43.665
I was think y'all might know
where they towed my truck.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.363
Uh, no, no.
Don't you have the 800 number?

14:46.407 --> 14:48.322
I've called.
Left a couple of messages,

14:48.365 --> 14:50.106
but it's impossible to get
a real person on the phone.

14:50.150 --> 14:51.325
If you want, I can
make a few calls

14:51.368 --> 14:53.109
and look into it for you.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.329
Would you?
That'd be real helpful.

14:55.372 --> 14:57.374
Yeah, here.
Just write down your number

14:57.418 --> 15:00.464
and if we find it,
I'll give you a ring.

15:00.508 --> 15:01.726
Thanks.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.772
Look, I really appreciate it, Lieutenant.

15:03.815 --> 15:06.253
It's Kelly Severide.

15:07.515 --> 15:09.125
- All right, thank you.
- Yeah, absolutely.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.997
And, hey, keep those burns
covered up.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.913
Yeah, seriously.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.044
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.920
So I just got
a calendar reminder.

15:20.963 --> 15:25.141
I forgot we had scheduled
the tasting at the venue today.

15:25.185 --> 15:26.751
- Right.
- Mm.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.539
Should we blow it off?

15:31.582 --> 15:33.715
You okay with that?

15:33.758 --> 15:35.499
Yeah, totally.

15:35.543 --> 15:39.025
I mean, yeah.
I actually... I have a...

15:39.068 --> 15:42.071
bunch of paperwork
to do anyway.

15:42.115 --> 15:44.552
Yeah, I was hoping
to track down

15:44.595 --> 15:45.857
that food truck from yesterday.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.816
Oh, there you go.
Win-win.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.778
Yeah, yeah,
I'll see you at home.

15:53.822 --> 15:56.042
Yeah.

15:56.085 --> 15:58.348
- Hey, Lieutenant.
- Hey.

15:58.392 --> 16:00.002
Oh, hey, I can help you
track down that food truck,

16:00.046 --> 16:01.525

16:01.569 --> 16:03.484
Uh...

16:03.527 --> 16:04.789
you sure?

16:04.833 --> 16:07.227
I know you got family
waiting for you at home.

16:07.270 --> 16:08.358
Actually, I don't.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.491
Chloe's at work,
Javi's at school,

16:10.534 --> 16:11.622

I'm your second best man.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.409

16:17.541 --> 16:20.240

but with discretionary budgets

got to allow for...

16:24.984 --> 16:26.115
Let me call you back.

16:28.639 --> 16:29.684
What can I do for you, Gallo?

16:29.727 --> 16:31.425
Violet told me
what Emma's doing.

16:33.601 --> 16:34.950
And you're not seriously
gonna go along with

16:34.994 --> 16:37.822
this blackmail scheme, are you?
- Of course not.

16:37.866 --> 16:40.129
Okay, so what are you
gonna do about it?

16:40.173 --> 16:41.304
It's complicated.

16:41.348 --> 16:43.785
Oh, I know
how complicated it is.

16:43.828 --> 16:45.830
Yeah, well,
no offense, Gallo,

your business.

16:48.659 --> 16:49.878

it's not my business.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.271
Violet's my friend

16:51.314 --> 16:53.447

to just stand by

16:53.490 --> 16:55.536
while some sociopath tries
to blow up her career.

She came with such
a strong recommendation,

"Not Applicable" over it
