WEBVTT

00:10.778 --> 00:14.014
*

00:27.428 --> 00:28.429
What do you got, Ray?

00:28.462 --> 00:30.498
We're looking for two perps
with machine guns

00:30.531 --> 00:31.632
for a triple homicide.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.534
They went
on a cash-grabbing spree,

00:33.567 --> 00:35.703
six stores
in less than a half-hour.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.638
So they knew what
were they after.

00:37.671 --> 00:38.772
Well, you'd think,

00:38.806 --> 00:40.708
but take a look
at the targets:

00:40.741 --> 00:42.543
we got a shoe store, CD store,

00:42.576 --> 00:45.379
jewelry store, electronics
store, coffee shop.

00:45.413 --> 00:46.780
I mean, they blew right
past the bank

00:46.814 --> 00:48.082
and a check-cashing place.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.350
That's unusual.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.419
RAY: This jewelry store was the
last stop.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.354
Opened fire
as they fled the scene.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.089
DON: We'd love to help you, Ray.

00:55.123 --> 00:58.292
I mean, it's not exactly
a federal case.

00:58.326 --> 01:00.561
Actually, we got video
from four of the stores.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.263
Picture's pretty much useless.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.264
We need it bumped up.

01:03.297 --> 01:04.598
What are you talking about?

01:04.632 --> 01:06.300
LAPD's got a great crime lab.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.602
Yeah, but the FBI's
got your brother

01:08.636 --> 01:09.803
the math professor.

01:09.837 --> 01:10.838
My brother?

01:10.871 --> 01:12.106
One of our techs read
about some

01:12.140 --> 01:15.709
video enhancement program he's
involved with at the university.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.178
We were kind of hoping
we could reach out.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.690
CHARLIE:
We all use math every day...

01:29.723 --> 01:31.325
to predict weather...

01:31.359 --> 01:34.328
to tell time...

01:34.362 --> 01:37.431
to handle money...

01:37.465 --> 01:41.635
Math is more than formulas and
equations.

01:41.669 --> 01:44.672
It's logic.

01:44.705 --> 01:47.208
It's rationality.

01:47.241 --> 01:51.111
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

01:59.687 --> 02:01.822
Here's a still from the camera

02:01.855 --> 02:03.023
in the jewelry store;
low-res digital.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.359
Most surveillance cameras
don't retain enough information

02:05.393 --> 02:06.427
to blow up clearly.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.262
When we zoom in--

02:08.296 --> 02:09.062
we can't.

02:09.096 --> 02:12.200
The information's
just not there.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.568
But Charlie provided me
with a predictive algorithm.

02:14.602 --> 02:15.736
A mathematical
equation

02:15.769 --> 02:18.439
to help the computer guess
at what's between the dots.

02:18.472 --> 02:22.443
Extrapolations of information
based on the surrounding pixels.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.711
In fact, the equation looks

02:23.744 --> 02:24.678
a little something
like this.

02:24.712 --> 02:25.646
Wow.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.549
You don't really care
about the equation.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.551
Let's just say we can't fully
appreciate it.

02:30.584 --> 02:31.685
How long to enhance

02:31.719 --> 02:32.686
all the footage?

02:32.720 --> 02:34.588
We're halfway done, so we'll

02:34.622 --> 02:36.524
have a full-play version
in an hour or two.

02:36.557 --> 02:37.258
Okay.

02:37.291 --> 02:37.925
That's a Steyr
TMP automatic.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.527
That's an expensive weapon.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.829
Mm-mm. And look at the
watch-- Bell & Ross.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.531
There's got to be,
what, at least

02:43.564 --> 02:45.699
a half a million dollars
in jewels in those cases

02:45.733 --> 02:47.668
and they pass it up
to grab $1,100 in cash

02:47.701 --> 02:49.303
out of the till?

02:49.337 --> 02:50.170
It helps out
my thrill-kill theory.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.171
( phone rings )
Excuse me.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.707
Thrill killers get a rush off of
fear and chaos.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.643
These two appear deliberate
and organized.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.611
They've have a plan.
They're after something.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.347
Yeah, but if it's not for money
and it's not for kicks...

02:59.380 --> 03:01.715
Right, we'll
be right there.

03:01.749 --> 03:02.683
We've got another
crime scene.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.618
Shell casings match
a Steyr TMP automatic.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.528
( garbled radio transmission)

03:15.663 --> 03:16.697
OFFICER: Crime scene's over
there.

03:16.730 --> 03:17.731
- How you doin'?
- Good, thanks.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.938
Wait. Hold on a sec.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.342
Looks like someone went
on a shopping spree:

03:28.376 --> 03:31.912
iPods, tennis shoes,
a watch...

03:33.947 --> 03:35.616
This is one of the stores
that was hit.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.920
Wait a minute. These, too.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.722
All cash transactions?

03:41.755 --> 03:42.723
Yeah, it's cash.

03:42.756 --> 03:43.657
Yeah. Same here.

03:45.326 --> 03:48.496
( phone rings )

03:48.529 --> 03:49.897
Eppes.

03:49.930 --> 03:50.931
Hey. I found something

03:50.964 --> 03:51.999
interesting on the video.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.767
Several hours before the crimes

03:53.801 --> 03:55.536
at every single store
that's robbed,

03:55.569 --> 03:56.870
two teenage boys appear.

03:56.904 --> 03:57.938
What were they doing?

03:57.971 --> 03:58.939
Shopping.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.007
Shopping?

04:00.040 --> 04:02.343
Wait a minute.
Hold on a second.

04:02.376 --> 04:05.279
Two teenagers...

04:05.313 --> 04:09.350
they're male, white,
got one with spiky blonde hair,

04:09.383 --> 04:10.384
the other with a goatee?

04:15.055 --> 04:16.724
Tell me you already have them.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.759
You could say that.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.863
The two dead boys
are Chris and Jason Miller.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.298
They're brothers,
19 and 16.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.299
M.E. puts their death

04:25.333 --> 04:26.500
at about 2:00 P.M.

04:26.534 --> 04:29.069
So that's what, like...

04:29.102 --> 04:31.572
a half an hour before
the robberies took place.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.341
We'll have to wait for Forensics
to confirm it,

04:33.374 --> 04:34.575
but it seems like
the shell casings

04:34.608 --> 04:35.943
from the robberies
match the shooting.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.045
We got two kids shopping
the same stores

04:38.078 --> 04:40.748
that were robbed,
between 10:00 and noon.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.816
And they're both dead by 2:00.

04:42.850 --> 04:47.788
Chris borrowed $300
last month for his car.

04:47.821 --> 04:51.525
He paid me back last night.

04:51.559 --> 04:52.560
In cash?

04:52.593 --> 04:53.794
Mm-hmm.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.095
Do you mind?

04:55.128 --> 04:57.030
Thank you.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.436
All ten dollar bills?

05:04.572 --> 05:07.074
Where'd he get it?

05:07.107 --> 05:08.342
They're teenagers.

05:08.376 --> 05:12.346
They don't tell me anything.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.914
Poker?

05:16.083 --> 05:17.985
Poker, maybe?

05:19.453 --> 05:20.354
It'll be returned,

05:20.388 --> 05:22.089
as soon as we're sure
it's not connected

05:22.122 --> 05:24.658
in any way.

05:24.692 --> 05:27.761
Did either of them
have jobs?

05:27.795 --> 05:30.130
Chris, my oldest,

05:30.163 --> 05:34.067
he's been working at a movie
studio in North Hollywood.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.103
Where'd you hear that?

05:36.136 --> 05:38.105
I don't know if I'd call
us a movie studio.

05:38.138 --> 05:41.141
Couple of low-budget productions
rented space here.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.976
Mainly we got manufacturing;

05:43.010 --> 05:45.446
we got wrought iron,
got a box company.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.847
Chris' mother said he worked
here for four months.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.582
Yeah, pretty good worker, too.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.385
But now I gotta drive
all the way in from Duarte.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.421
Oh, yeah, must be tough
on you, huh?

05:53.454 --> 05:55.022
Hey, hey, I am sorry

05:55.055 --> 05:59.493
about that kid,
but my problems go on.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.762
See, last night,
one of my tenants bailed on me,

06:01.795 --> 06:04.665
no notice, no nothing.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.567
I don't need this
in my life.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.101
DON:
Sorry to disturb you.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.071
You say your tenants
moved out

06:11.104 --> 06:12.406
in the middle
of the night?

06:12.440 --> 06:13.774
DAVID: And then the kid who
works here

06:13.807 --> 06:14.642
was killed
the next day.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.644
What kind of operation
went on here?

06:16.677 --> 06:19.813
They put out a newsletter,
I think.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.182
Never read it,
just saw the printing equipment.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.917
You knew them?

06:23.951 --> 06:26.420
You dealt with them
face-to-face?

06:26.454 --> 06:29.022
Uh, no. Actually,
Chris dealt with them.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.758
I never met 'em.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.143
You got something?

06:50.177 --> 06:51.144
Not sure.

06:53.213 --> 06:56.450
What is that, ink?

06:56.484 --> 06:58.051
Could be.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.553
Got a piece of paper?

06:59.587 --> 07:01.455
Yeah.

07:01.489 --> 07:03.524
Look at this.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.059
It's paper, but
feels like fabric.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.497
Got a cotton-linen
feel to it.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.164
Let me see.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.800
It's weird.
This is shiny.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.039
You better put in a call
to Secret Service.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.841
WOMAN:
You're right. It's counterfeit.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.010
See the watermarks?

07:23.043 --> 07:23.977
DAVID:
Yeah. Sure.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.079
You shouldn't,
under an ultraviolet light.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.515
Paper's another giveaway.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.182
Someone have
a genuine bill?

07:29.216 --> 07:32.219
Yeah. Here you go.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.186
Great. Thanks.

07:36.023 --> 07:36.990
There you go.
You see the difference?

07:38.626 --> 07:41.662
It's pretty good work, though.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.831
Most of us at the Secret Service
are dealing

07:43.864 --> 07:45.733
with poor quality counterfeits.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.200
We call 'em "P-notes."

07:47.234 --> 07:50.037
They're actually printed
on home computers.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.572
- That actually works?
- Dark restaurant,

07:51.605 --> 07:52.740
busy grocery store.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.975
You'd be surprised.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.710
This is a different game,
though.

07:56.744 --> 07:57.778
This is old school,

07:57.811 --> 07:59.813
engraving and printing.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.750
Paper's got good feel,
magnetic ink.

08:02.783 --> 08:03.751
Magnetic?

08:03.784 --> 08:05.085
Real bills employ

08:05.118 --> 08:06.219
different magnetic inks.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.955
That's how a bank's sorters

08:07.988 --> 08:09.723
distinguish different
denominations.

08:09.757 --> 08:12.225
Our guys are old-school
philosophy

08:12.259 --> 08:13.794
and state-of-the-art technology.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.195
Our guys?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.933
The Secret Service has been
tracking this crew.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.769
They've resurfaced
periodically

08:21.802 --> 08:23.303
over the last five years.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.004
Hey.

08:24.037 --> 08:24.872
The tip-off is the denomination.

08:24.905 --> 08:25.806
- Most counterfeiters print--
- Hey.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.608
50s and hundreds.
Higher return, right?

08:27.641 --> 08:28.809
Yeah, and higher risk.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.210
Big bills get
more scrutiny.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.312
These guys are conservative
and patient.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.647
They only print
small bills

08:33.681 --> 08:34.982
and they never spend them.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.284
How do they profit
if they don't spend the bills?

08:37.317 --> 08:38.652
Well, they can sell
them in bulk.

08:38.686 --> 08:39.653
They can lay off
a million of these

08:39.687 --> 08:40.788
and get $300,000, $400,000.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.690
Yeah, usually to gangs
or other criminal enterprises,

08:42.723 --> 08:44.692
who then use it
to fund more crime.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.794
So these aren't "copies"

08:46.827 --> 08:49.262
in the traditional sense
of the word, then.

08:49.296 --> 08:52.032
No, they're hand-rendered
by an artist,

08:52.065 --> 08:54.868
then the engraving
process begins.

08:54.902 --> 08:55.903
Someone actually
draws these?

08:55.936 --> 08:58.038
You've been tracking
these guys for five years.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.239
You must have active suspects.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.240
Not yet,

09:00.273 --> 09:01.274
no.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.876
We'll, uh, we'll run a search,

09:02.910 --> 09:04.678
tell banks to keep an eye out
for bills

09:04.712 --> 09:05.979
with a similar serial range

09:06.013 --> 09:07.581
and maybe this time
we'll get lucky.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.850
You don't sound optimistic.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.184
These guys have been beating
our playbook

09:11.218 --> 09:12.653
since before I inherited
the case.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.154
We'll work the money.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.288
I think you should work the
homicides separately.

09:15.322 --> 09:16.590
It's actually
Grounded Theory.

09:16.624 --> 09:19.159
This problem screams

09:19.192 --> 09:20.160
for a case-oriented
approach.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.228
Excuse me?

09:21.261 --> 09:23.163
In Grounded Theory,

09:23.196 --> 09:25.132
the homicides would
have one solution,

09:25.165 --> 09:26.900
the counterfeiting
another.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.301
In a case-oriented approach,

09:28.335 --> 09:30.070
the homicides become
a variable set

09:30.103 --> 09:31.338
interacting in some complex
manner with

09:31.371 --> 09:33.707
the counterfeiting
variable set.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.375
Can I have a word with you?

09:35.408 --> 09:37.210
Sure.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.015
Can you explain to me
what your brother is doing

09:42.049 --> 09:43.016
in a federal office,

09:43.050 --> 09:44.351
wandering into the middle of my
investigation?

09:44.384 --> 09:45.385
Well, first of all,

09:45.418 --> 09:46.754
he happens to be a
Bureau-approved consultant,

09:46.787 --> 09:47.788
and second of all,

09:47.821 --> 09:48.922
this seems like
one case to me.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.024
Okay, you still could
have briefed me ahead of time.

09:51.058 --> 09:56.063
Come on. I don't think
this is about my brother.

09:57.831 --> 10:01.769
All right. That's fair.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.303
So I guess you
left Albuquerque.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.372
Yeah. I left Albuquerque.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.377
Look,

10:10.410 --> 10:11.378
your mom got sick.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.680
You had to move back home.

10:12.713 --> 10:13.747
I've always understood that.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.954
Well, look, let's just
focus on the work, okay?

10:22.055 --> 10:23.691
That was never a problem,
was it?

10:31.932 --> 10:34.067
Chris Miller discovers
they're printing counterfeit,

10:34.101 --> 10:35.335
he steals some money.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.270
He and his brother
decide to go shopping.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.739
Bad guys find out,
kill the brothers,

10:38.772 --> 10:40.741
rob back the phony cash
to cover their tracks.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.677
Right, so they're
thorough and ruthless.

10:43.711 --> 10:44.745
I don't know.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.714
The counterfeiters' M.O.--
small bills, patience--

10:46.747 --> 10:48.381
that suggests someone
older, experienced,

10:48.415 --> 10:49.817
someone who lays low.

10:49.850 --> 10:50.684
- Yeah, not our gunmen.
- Mm-mm. No.

10:50.718 --> 10:53.053
They got high-end
watches, weapons.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.823
I think we're dealing
with a multi-person crew.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.390
Yeah, and a multi-
personality crew.

10:57.424 --> 10:58.826
A group like that
won't last long,

10:58.859 --> 10:59.960
too much internal
friction.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.294
Kim says she thinks
they've been

11:01.328 --> 11:03.430
working together
something like five years.

11:03.463 --> 11:04.965
Well, maybe the younger guys

11:04.998 --> 11:06.700
are working with
an older counterfeiter.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.368
That'd be a good
place to start.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.003
Speaking of Agent Hall,

11:10.037 --> 11:11.471
everything okay
with you guys?

11:11.504 --> 11:12.472
- Yeah.
- Couldn't help noticing.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.474
No, it's just a little
interagency politics.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.376
They're all worked out.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.978
All right.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.446
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.419
Hello?

11:26.453 --> 11:28.121
Hello.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.422
Hey.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.759
What are you doing?

11:31.792 --> 11:33.927
I'm running a comparison

11:33.961 --> 11:36.163
between the counterfeit bills
you found earlier today

11:36.196 --> 11:37.164
and the older bills

11:37.197 --> 11:39.299
that that Secret Service agent
lady gave us.

11:39.332 --> 11:42.202
There's a possibility
that the small differences

11:42.235 --> 11:44.204
may yield some data

11:44.237 --> 11:45.372
about their current operation.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.441
By the way, I did not mean
to cause a problem earlier.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.143
You don't have to apologize
for anything.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.312
Agent Hall and I
are... are...

11:52.345 --> 11:55.315
I mean, we worked it out. So...

11:55.348 --> 11:57.751
You know if I left
a box of stuff here?

11:57.785 --> 11:59.286
What kind of stuff?

11:59.319 --> 12:00.988
It's just this one box
in particular.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.222
When I moved back from
Albuquerque,

12:02.255 --> 12:05.325
I thought I got everything,
but it's not in my apartment.

12:05.358 --> 12:06.493
I can't remember where I put it.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.761
You check the garage?

12:07.795 --> 12:08.695
Yeah.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.363
( door opens )
That you, Dad?

12:10.397 --> 12:12.766
Hey, let me
get the door.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.301
You must have
some kind of sixth sense.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.503
I buy rib-eye,
and you just materialize.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.405
Well, actually...

12:18.438 --> 12:19.907
You say rib-eye?

12:19.940 --> 12:21.008
Yeah.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.810
With, like, a baked potato?

12:24.211 --> 12:25.979
Oh, very nice,
Charlie.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.048
How long is this going to be?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.549
This is just for
a few days.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.952
I needed to look at this
as soon as I possibly could.

12:31.985 --> 12:36.023
Now, the spiral patterns
in money

12:36.056 --> 12:38.792
are based on a technique
called guilloche.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.493
It's like a wheel within
a wheel within a wheel;

12:40.527 --> 12:41.528
a pattern created by

12:41.561 --> 12:43.797
the additions and
multiplications

12:43.831 --> 12:45.565
of nested sine waves.
Same was used

12:45.598 --> 12:48.869
by Faberge to create
those little famous eggs.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.503
Well, that explains it.

12:50.537 --> 12:53.206
What does this have to do
with the case?

12:53.240 --> 12:54.875
I think they have a new artist.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.443
In fact,
I'm sure of it.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.945
How can you tell that?

12:57.978 --> 12:59.346
I've been running
a wavelet analysis

12:59.379 --> 13:00.447
of these spirals
I'm talking about.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.816
Mathematicians at Dartmouth
use a similar process

13:02.850 --> 13:04.551
to test authenticity
of masterpiece paintings.

13:04.584 --> 13:05.485
Here, look it...

13:08.588 --> 13:10.190
Ten dollars. Right?

13:10.223 --> 13:12.259
Now we don't often
think about it,

13:12.292 --> 13:14.862
but someone must've drawn
this design, right?

13:14.895 --> 13:16.463
You're right.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.397
I want you to think

13:17.430 --> 13:20.567
of that artist as a runner
on the beach.

13:20.600 --> 13:24.537
He's leaving footprints,

13:24.571 --> 13:26.606
which record every decision
he makes;

13:26.639 --> 13:29.209
faster, slower,
closer to the water,

13:29.242 --> 13:31.411
farther away...

13:31.444 --> 13:33.246
Now these are counterfeit bills.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.949
A second artist
trying to copy the original...

13:35.983 --> 13:37.117
a second runner.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.853
Now, when that second runner
tries to follow

13:39.887 --> 13:43.223
the exact path as the first,
it's impossible.

13:43.256 --> 13:46.159
Even if he's being careful,
he can't match the footprints

13:46.193 --> 13:48.161
without leaving evidence
of himself.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.397
Different foot size,
different stride--

13:50.430 --> 13:51.965
that's how you spot a forgery.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.968
And when a third runner
tries to match the footprints,

13:55.002 --> 13:57.004
he'll leave evidence
as well,

13:57.037 --> 13:59.973
but in a different way
than the second runner.

14:00.007 --> 14:04.177
These two counterfeit bills
have two different footprints...

14:04.211 --> 14:06.579
Hence the new artist.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.149
- You find that artist...
- Charlie,

14:09.182 --> 14:11.018
we can't find
the counterfeiter,

14:11.051 --> 14:12.319
let alone the artist.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.187
You keep on saying
he's an artist, this guy.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.622
He's not really an artist,
is he?

14:15.655 --> 14:17.891
He's more like a copier.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.927
It's actually, it's more like
being able to draw,

14:19.960 --> 14:21.361
you know, say,
the Mona Lis freehand.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.395
Oh, I see.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.531
What I can do now, Don,

14:24.564 --> 14:29.069
is to take this initial
comparative analysis and...

14:34.607 --> 14:35.508
Hey, David, it's Don.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.344
Look, I want to expand
the search, okay?

14:37.377 --> 14:39.246
Not just counterfeiters,
but art forgers.

14:40.647 --> 14:41.949
Eight art forgers fit our
profile.

14:41.982 --> 14:42.882
Great.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.517
There's another case
you need to look at.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.419
It stuck with me because
it happened in Venice,

14:46.453 --> 14:47.620
- in my neighborhood.
- Right.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.622
It was the weapons used that
really caught my attention.

14:49.656 --> 14:50.690
A lady was abducted
three weeks ago.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.960
One Margo Hughes.

14:52.993 --> 14:53.860
Confronted by
two men armed

14:53.893 --> 14:56.263
with what the LAPD
report describes as

14:56.296 --> 14:58.531
"exotic machine pistols."

14:58.565 --> 15:00.167
Just like our guys
in Steyr-TMPs.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.034
I think so.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.169
All right,
I'll borrow this. Thanks.

15:02.202 --> 15:02.569
Okay.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.505
You think my wife's abduction

15:05.538 --> 15:06.606
had something to do
with her art?

15:06.639 --> 15:09.009
It's an angle
we're investigating.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.677
These are some of
her pieces right here.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.012
You mind?

15:12.045 --> 15:13.046
No, go ahead.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.048
Your wife did
reproductions.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.417
Yeah, she calls it
her "Miniaturist Phase."

15:17.450 --> 15:20.620
Reduces classic portraits
to see if their power survives.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.189
Incredible detail...

15:22.222 --> 15:23.590
These are what, ink?

15:23.623 --> 15:24.691
Done freehand.

15:24.724 --> 15:27.527
Margo's amazing like that.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.761
Look, what's going on?

15:28.795 --> 15:31.298
We're hoping to compare some of
your wife's reproductions...

15:31.331 --> 15:32.299
We'd like to

15:32.332 --> 15:34.234
borrow some of your wife's work,
if that's okay.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.702
I'll personally
take responsibility

15:35.735 --> 15:37.604
that you'll get it back
and it'll be safe.

15:39.739 --> 15:40.607
Yeah.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.409
Look, you're here
to pick out samples,

15:42.442 --> 15:44.511
not talk about
an open investigation.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.179
Poor guy.
He seemed so upset.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.681
Yeah, well, he's a potential
suspect, Charlie.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.150
Something bothering you?

15:50.183 --> 15:52.085
No. Nothing's
bothering me.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.753
Something seems
to be bothering you.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.655
Yeah, well, there's
nothing bothering me.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.465
CHARLIE:
I've compared Margo's work to

16:05.498 --> 16:06.633
the counterfeit $10 bills.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.468
These are two dimensional
representations

16:08.501 --> 16:09.769
of a multi-dimensional graph

16:09.802 --> 16:11.738
actually plotted
in 72 dimensions.

16:11.771 --> 16:12.739
Just simplify it, okay?

16:12.772 --> 16:14.741
- Just put it in layman's terms.
- Bottom line--

16:14.774 --> 16:16.676
I've made comparisons
with the works

16:16.709 --> 16:19.479
of over a dozen known
forgers and counterfeiters.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.414
None of them
had any similarities.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.583
But these graphs match.

16:23.616 --> 16:24.784
They're identical.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.320
Margo Hughes drew
this ten-dollar bill.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.060
I mean, she has been missing
for three weeks.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.294
Okay, and as far
as we know,

16:34.327 --> 16:36.529
they've only introduced
their ten.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.798
If they follow pattern,
they'll release a 20 soon.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.201
What's your guesstimate
of how long it would take

16:41.234 --> 16:42.435
to draw one of these 20s?

16:42.469 --> 16:43.703
Hard to say,

16:43.736 --> 16:46.239
but if I were
Margo Hughes,

16:46.273 --> 16:47.040
I'd be taking my time.

16:47.074 --> 16:49.042
As soon as they're
done with her...

16:49.076 --> 16:49.909
She becomes a liability.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.544
They'll have no choice
but to kill her.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.247
That's what I'm thinking.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.794
Okay, so what we're going with

17:07.827 --> 17:10.197
is the counterfeiters
kidnapped Margo Hughes

17:10.230 --> 17:12.532
to get her to make a template
to make phony money.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.534
Right? All agreed?

17:14.567 --> 17:17.637
Now my problem is if we don't
break some kind of lead soon

17:17.670 --> 17:19.139
and find these guys,

17:19.172 --> 17:21.408
I don't think
we're saving this woman.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.176
KIM:
Great. Thanks.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.079
Okay, we told banks
to watch for the bogus tens.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.447
They've been showing up.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.349
We have Bakersfield,
San Bernardino

17:29.382 --> 17:30.450
and Palm Springs.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.085
DAVID: That's great. So we find
out

17:32.119 --> 17:33.420
who's spending it
and work our way back,

17:33.453 --> 17:35.522
the same way we work drugs
back to the supplier.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.490
The problem is,
the banks can't link the bills

17:37.524 --> 17:39.492
to a specific depositor.
They're in circulation

17:39.526 --> 17:41.494
and there's no way to trace
them. People shop in patterns.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.596
Patterns can be quantified
into equations.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.498
The Secret Service and
the Treasury Department

17:45.532 --> 17:47.767
have been working on this
problem for decades.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.469
Predicting money flow,

17:49.502 --> 17:51.538
tracing counterfeit
in circulation--

17:51.571 --> 17:53.606
it's unpredictable;
there are too many variables.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.475
That makes it challenging,
not impossible.

17:55.508 --> 17:58.411
Right now, the dispersal
seems fairly contained.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.813
And that works
in our favor.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.315
Then what do you need from us?

18:02.349 --> 18:03.416
Data. Lots of it.
Everything from where

18:03.450 --> 18:05.652
these bills are turning up--
and not just from banks,

18:05.685 --> 18:08.255
from stores, from restaurants,
from movie theaters...

18:08.288 --> 18:10.290
I'd like to follow the evidence
from the warehouse.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.125
The lab was able
to reconstruct an ink sample

18:12.159 --> 18:13.626
from the scrapings
you took off the floor.

18:13.660 --> 18:14.627
All right. Good.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.596
Let me get you a list
of known counterfeiters.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.598
I find that even
the one's who're retired

18:18.631 --> 18:21.234
tend to keep up on
the latest technology.

18:21.268 --> 18:24.304
We're looking for counterfeit
ten dollar bills.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.439
Now, they've shown up
in three geographic clusters.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.541
We're going to isolate
the one in San Bernardino.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.511
That means checking into
grocery stores, gas stations,

18:31.544 --> 18:33.913
restaurants, just
door-to-door canvassing.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.149
The bills you're looking
for are good, not perfect.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.116
This sheet details

18:37.150 --> 18:39.752
some of the differences
to help you ID them.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.554
Find a bill,
call it in immediately, please.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.523
The more we find,
the faster we find them,

18:43.556 --> 18:44.657
the better our chances

18:44.691 --> 18:46.559
of figuring out where
the next ones will come from.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.495
And I know I don't need
to reiterate this,

18:48.528 --> 18:50.930
but there is a 24-year-old
woman's life at stake here.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.465
So let's go. Thank you.

19:22.629 --> 19:26.366
You can move your
San Bernardino search grid

19:26.399 --> 19:30.203
south of Foothill and
west of Mount Vernon.

19:30.237 --> 19:31.538
Okay?

19:31.571 --> 19:32.905
Exactly.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.674
Yeah. Bye.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.776
Charlie, I wish I understood
what we're doing here.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.479
It's a probability
algorithm.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.548
That doesn't help me.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.416
The bills start at zero-zero--

19:43.450 --> 19:45.218
the counterfeiters.

19:48.288 --> 19:51.558
We start here--

19:51.591 --> 19:53.293
point XY.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.761
As we locate
each bill,

19:54.794 --> 19:58.631
we get a better idea
of the dispersion,

19:58.665 --> 20:02.669
a better idea of where
to look for more bills.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.636
Right.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.538
You're not going to look
in the next room...

20:05.572 --> 20:09.376
Or certainly not on the ceiling,
or in the parking lot.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.244
So the more bills
you find in a given area,

20:11.278 --> 20:12.845
the closer you are
to the counterfeiters?

20:12.879 --> 20:14.581
It's not just the number
of bills.

20:14.614 --> 20:17.384
I assign values based
on the purchases.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.953
So, for instance, two or three
bills showing up in a tire shop

20:20.987 --> 20:23.590
may hold less significance
than a single bill

20:23.623 --> 20:24.591
in a corner market.

20:24.624 --> 20:28.628
Someone may travel
way across town for tires.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.663
But a quart of milk,
carton of cigarettes,

20:30.697 --> 20:32.031
that they'd get closer to home.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.933
I think we both get it.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.736
Yes. You and your brother
are a lot alike.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.971
You think so?

20:39.005 --> 20:41.508
Most people can't get over
how different we are.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.910
Well, yeah, the interests
are pretty different,

20:43.943 --> 20:46.379
but the approach--

20:46.413 --> 20:49.382
this one part exuberance,
two parts obsession--

20:49.416 --> 20:51.984
that's pretty much
identical.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.554
When Don and I
first moved in together,

20:54.587 --> 20:56.856
we had to have
separate CD racks

20:56.889 --> 20:58.891
because I never put mine
back in the same place,

20:58.925 --> 20:59.992
and he has to know

21:00.026 --> 21:02.862
where each song is
at every moment.

21:02.895 --> 21:06.399
You and Don lived together?

21:06.433 --> 21:09.035
In Albuquerque.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.705
You didn't know? He didn't...

21:12.739 --> 21:15.775
You know, we lost touch
for a while, so...

21:15.808 --> 21:17.510
He may very well have told me,

21:17.544 --> 21:19.612
um, but, uh,
you know what?

21:19.646 --> 21:23.383
I didn't put that Kim
together with, uh, you know,

21:23.416 --> 21:25.685
you, Kim.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.320
Aw, it's all right.

21:27.354 --> 21:28.588
I know how Don is.

21:31.791 --> 21:35.662
( machine clacking )

21:35.695 --> 21:37.630
DAVID:
Eddie Zakarian?

21:42.735 --> 21:44.704
( turns off machine )

21:44.737 --> 21:46.573
Counterfeiting, right?

21:46.606 --> 21:48.107
Anytime I see
a Fed badge,

21:48.140 --> 21:51.411
I know it's not about
undercollecting sales tax.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.846
I guess that comes from having
a criminal record like yours.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.416
No, it comes from having been
one of the best in the business.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.818
But I'm not in the
business anymore.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.488
Haven't been for 25 years.

22:01.521 --> 22:04.391
You people need to put it
in a newsletter or something.

22:04.424 --> 22:05.558
What do we
have to thank

22:05.592 --> 22:07.026
for this inspirational
rehabilitation?

22:07.059 --> 22:08.795
Fatherhood.
Keeps you out of prison.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.963
These two yours?

22:10.997 --> 22:12.765
Yeah.

22:12.799 --> 22:14.734
Goes back
a way though,

22:14.767 --> 22:16.569
different time.

22:16.603 --> 22:19.706
Before everybody in the
world had a computer,

22:19.739 --> 22:22.475
became a printer.

22:22.509 --> 22:23.710
What do you make of this?

22:28.014 --> 22:28.981
Nice.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.550
Near perfect.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.085
It's O.V.I.

22:33.119 --> 22:34.554
O.V.I.?

22:34.587 --> 22:37.056
Optically variable ink.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.892
Takes three different inks
to print money, right?

22:39.926 --> 22:42.429
Black for the front,
green for the back

22:42.462 --> 22:44.764
and then there's
this-- O.V.I.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.833
It changes color
from green to black,

22:46.866 --> 22:48.835
depending on how
you look at it.

22:48.868 --> 22:49.969
Who could've mixed it?

22:50.002 --> 22:51.137
Other than me?

22:51.170 --> 22:53.540
Try Marty Blanchard.

22:53.573 --> 22:56.443
It'd explain why his shop's got
so much new equipment.

22:56.476 --> 22:57.777
Mm.

22:57.810 --> 22:58.478
What?

22:58.511 --> 23:00.146
His name came out pretty fast.

23:00.179 --> 23:01.681
Oh, I'm sorry--

23:01.714 --> 23:03.483
honor among thieves, right?

23:03.516 --> 23:04.717
Listen, back in the day,

23:04.751 --> 23:06.886
who do you think gave me up,
anyway?

23:06.919 --> 23:09.689
What goes around comes around.

23:10.823 --> 23:14.060
( machine clacking )

23:22.869 --> 23:24.937
Um, you know, I'm, I'm beginning
to wonder, uh,

23:24.971 --> 23:27.774
if I properly weighted
the exchange velocity...

23:27.807 --> 23:28.741
Look, don't,
don't do that.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.477
Don't second-
guess yourself.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.745
Every time we tighten the search
grids, more bills show up.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.080
So just be patient, all right?

23:34.113 --> 23:35.915
Just sit tight, let us
do our job, please.

23:35.948 --> 23:38.818
So you and, uh...
you and Kim, Kim...

23:38.851 --> 23:40.152
Kim and you...

23:41.921 --> 23:42.955
Yeah.

23:44.691 --> 23:47.760
Is that a, um...
that a serious thing?

23:51.864 --> 23:54.100
Yeah.

23:54.133 --> 23:57.704
Seems kind of weird
I didn't know about it.

23:57.737 --> 24:00.507
I don't know who you dated
three years ago.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.875
KIM:
I got a hit.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.477
Dive bar in our
San Bernadino grid.

24:04.511 --> 24:06.813
Cash register turned up
seven of our counterfeits.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.014
Seven?!

24:08.047 --> 24:08.848
I'm sorry-- seven?!

24:08.881 --> 24:10.082
Yeah.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.218
Statistically, one or two bills
fit into the pattern spread.

24:12.251 --> 24:13.285
Someone with seven,
spending them

24:13.319 --> 24:15.221
in a local neighborhood
establishment is... huge.

24:15.254 --> 24:16.789
Guy drops 70 bucks
in a dive bar,

24:16.823 --> 24:18.257
he's either buying
rounds for the house,

24:18.290 --> 24:19.626
or he's wasted off his ass.

24:19.659 --> 24:20.827
Either way, he's
gonna stand out.

24:20.860 --> 24:21.928
KIM:
Right the first time.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.029
Bartender said he remembered

24:23.062 --> 24:24.531
a regular guy in last night,

24:24.564 --> 24:26.633
buying everybody drinks,
playing Mr. Big Shot.

24:26.666 --> 24:27.734
Lance Cummings.

24:29.035 --> 24:31.871
I'm gonna pay Mr. Cummings
a visit.

24:31.904 --> 24:32.972
I'll take the ride.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.674
DON:
You sit tight, all right?

24:34.707 --> 24:35.608
Sure.

24:38.778 --> 24:39.846
Hey, Charlie?

24:42.849 --> 24:45.718
You sure you want to be looking
through that stuff?

24:45.752 --> 24:47.887
Dad,

24:47.920 --> 24:51.090
do you recognize this lady?

24:53.092 --> 24:55.528
Uh, yeah, it's Kim, isn't it?

24:55.562 --> 24:57.163
That's Kim Hall.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.097
Yeah.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.533
She and Don lived together
in New Mexico

25:00.567 --> 25:03.202
and, uh, he never
told me about it.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.538
Well, you know
your brother.

25:05.572 --> 25:06.639
Yeah.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.810
DON:
'52 Ford, right?

25:10.843 --> 25:13.646
CUMMINGS:
Fifty-three.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.915
My dad had an old one
when I was a kid.

25:15.948 --> 25:19.819
Same engine,
four-barrel carb...

25:19.852 --> 25:21.588
He shouldn't have
gotten rid of it.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.222
Do you want something?

25:23.255 --> 25:24.624
Oh, yeah, sorry.

25:24.657 --> 25:25.925
I'm, uh, Agent Eppes

25:25.958 --> 25:27.560
with the FBI.

25:27.594 --> 25:28.895
This is Agent Hall.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.597
You were around
Wiley's last night?

25:30.630 --> 25:32.064
Mighta been...

25:32.098 --> 25:34.266
Some counterfeit money
showed up in the register.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.267
Ten-dollar bills.

25:35.301 --> 25:37.670
DON: Bartender seemed to notice

25:37.704 --> 25:38.871
you spending ten-dollar bills.

25:38.905 --> 25:41.908
That bartender was
drunker than I was.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.275
I had nothing
but twenties.

25:43.309 --> 25:45.044
I remember 'cause I, uh,

25:45.077 --> 25:46.946
I just hit the ATM.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.080
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:48.114 --> 25:50.249
Okay.

26:02.929 --> 26:06.098
He got on the phone
30 seconds after you left.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.868
CUMMINGS: Kevin, what the hell
are you thinking, man?

26:08.901 --> 26:10.169
You paid me with counterfeit!

26:10.202 --> 26:11.704
KEVIN:
What're you talking about?

26:11.738 --> 26:12.939
CUMMINGS:
The FBI was just here.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.841
KEVIN:: All right. Don't do
anything stupid.

26:14.874 --> 26:17.009
CUMMINGS: You calling me stupid,
you son of a bitch?!

26:17.043 --> 26:19.979
So, after two minutes
and 48 seconds of profanity,

26:20.012 --> 26:20.913
the upshot is that

26:20.947 --> 26:22.348
Cummings and
two other guys

26:22.381 --> 26:24.283
hijacked a truck full
of electronics.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.018
And the guy who hired them

26:26.052 --> 26:27.353
to pull
the hijacking job...

26:27.386 --> 26:28.888
Paid them with counterfeit.

26:28.921 --> 26:29.689
Right.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.323
The guy he's talking to--
Kevin...

26:31.357 --> 26:32.892
Kevin Merriman.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.794
He's done time for extortion,

26:34.827 --> 26:37.630
interstate fraud.

26:37.664 --> 26:40.032
He's a real
jack-of-all-trades.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.200
We traced his number.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.969
It's a 213 area code.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.003
Los Angeles.

26:44.036 --> 26:46.005
Back we go.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.174
I wonder if every
print shop in L.A.

26:48.207 --> 26:49.842
is run by a former
counterfeiter.

26:49.876 --> 26:52.912
DAVID: Zakarian said Blanchard
should be here.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.847
Likes to work at night.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.121
Is it just me,
or is there something going on

27:02.154 --> 27:03.189
between Don and Kim Hall?

27:05.357 --> 27:07.259
Did you know that you
always evade a question

27:07.293 --> 27:08.194
with a silent shrug?

27:10.129 --> 27:11.430
There it is again.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.834
You know, I-I hate it
when you profile me.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.903
I'm not going to stop.

27:18.705 --> 27:20.306
Redgrave told me she
used to be with Bureau.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.041
It was about three years
ago; Albuquerque office.

27:22.074 --> 27:22.875
So she worked for Don.

27:22.909 --> 27:26.078
Yeah, she, she used to work
for him.

27:26.112 --> 27:27.947
And, you know...

27:27.980 --> 27:29.115
Yeah?

27:29.148 --> 27:30.850
Can I be out of this now?

27:30.883 --> 27:32.151
( cell phone rings )

27:32.184 --> 27:33.085
Saved by the bell.

27:35.354 --> 27:36.322
Lake.

27:36.355 --> 27:37.690
Where're you at?

27:37.724 --> 27:38.925
Working a lead on the ink.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.126
Old-timer named
Martin Blanchard.

27:40.159 --> 27:43.129
You know what, trying dropping
the name, Kevin Merriman.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.131
Looks like he supplied
the counterfeit

27:45.164 --> 27:46.165
that went on to San Bernardino.

27:46.198 --> 27:48.200
Hold on a second.
This might be Blanchard now.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.906
Martin Blanchard?

27:56.242 --> 27:57.877
BLANCHARD: Something I can do
for you?

27:57.910 --> 27:59.411
I'm Special Agent
David Sinclair, FBI.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.113
David! Gun!

28:05.885 --> 28:06.853
( gunfire )

28:06.886 --> 28:08.020
Terry, what's going on?

28:08.054 --> 28:08.988
DON:
Terry, talk to me.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.157
Terry?

28:13.793 --> 28:16.328
( sirens blaring in distance,
indistinct conversations )

28:20.499 --> 28:22.835
It's just a bruise.
I'm fine.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.236
Better than Blanchard.

28:24.270 --> 28:25.872
Anything on the shooters?

28:25.905 --> 28:27.273
Pretty sure it's our guys.

28:27.306 --> 28:28.975
Same Steyr-TMP shells.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.110
I mean, obviously, they didn't
want us talking to Blanchard.

28:31.143 --> 28:32.912
We should run down
Blanchard's past associates,

28:32.945 --> 28:35.214
see if we can track any of them
back to the counterfeiters.

28:35.247 --> 28:36.949
Kim's already
got a couple agents on it.

28:36.983 --> 28:39.018
I think, if you're up for it,
you should go at Kevin Merriman.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.887
See if you can find out
where he got that bogus cash

28:40.920 --> 28:41.888
to pay his crew.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.222
I'm up for it. Let's go.

28:49.028 --> 28:51.530
Lance Cummings is under
arrest in San Bernadino

28:51.563 --> 28:53.132
and very annoyed with you.

28:53.165 --> 28:55.134
With his testimony
about your involvement

28:55.167 --> 28:56.268
in the truck hijackings

28:56.302 --> 28:58.037
and the stolen goods
in your house,

28:58.070 --> 29:00.539
I'm assuming your attorney wants
to be paid in advance.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.941
We want the
counterfeiters

29:01.974 --> 29:03.109
more than we want you.

29:03.142 --> 29:04.243
Thanks but no thanks.

29:04.276 --> 29:07.914
Hey, you're
a predicate felon.

29:07.947 --> 29:10.549
These are not light charges
against you.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.285
Take a step back
and look at the big picture.

29:13.319 --> 29:15.421
I am looking at the big picture.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.089
A live prisoner

29:17.123 --> 29:18.891
versus a dead rat.

29:18.925 --> 29:19.892
Hey.

29:19.926 --> 29:20.960
Hey.

29:20.993 --> 29:21.861
How's it going?

29:21.894 --> 29:24.196
They've been there
for a couple hours.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.032
Yeah.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.000
Not getting anything
we need.

29:29.836 --> 29:31.370
He gave us the truck heists
and the bogus bills,

29:31.403 --> 29:32.939
but he won't name
the counterfeiters.

29:32.972 --> 29:34.440
He's afraid they're gonna
find him and kill him.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.809
He's probably right.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.010
Oh, guys, I really
think we're running

29:38.044 --> 29:39.045
out of time on Margo Hughes.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.212
How are your people doing
on the dead printer?

29:40.246 --> 29:42.014
- They're digging.
- Yeah?

29:42.048 --> 29:44.083
Anything we can do to get them
to dig a little faster?

29:44.116 --> 29:45.551
They're doing
their jobs, Don.

29:45.584 --> 29:48.487
I can go back in,
try and work him.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.957
Think it'll
do any good?

29:50.990 --> 29:52.024
No.

29:52.058 --> 29:54.093
Agent Eppes, there's someone
waiting to see you.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.494
Jordan Hughes.

29:55.527 --> 29:56.428
All right.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.139
Agent Eppes... Agent Eppes,

30:07.173 --> 30:09.008
I was wondering if
you found anything--

30:09.041 --> 30:10.009
anything at all on my wife--

30:10.042 --> 30:11.944
Mr. Hughes, I'm sorry,
we are not at the point

30:11.978 --> 30:14.413
in the investigation where
I can share any details.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.182
Now I can tell you,
we're doing everything...

30:16.215 --> 30:18.050
Humanly possible?!

30:18.084 --> 30:18.985
Yeah.

30:19.018 --> 30:21.320
They've been telling
me that for 22 days.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.389
Th-The police haven't
called me in seven.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.091
My wife's family
won't talk to me.

30:25.124 --> 30:27.293
All I do is sit home,
you know, just sit at home,

30:27.326 --> 30:28.594
wondering what's going on.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.496
I understand. I'm sure
it's very difficult.

30:30.529 --> 30:33.499
I hope to be able to tell
you something very soon.

30:35.067 --> 30:38.504
You know something, don't you?

30:38.537 --> 30:40.072
Hey, if you could
just tell me

30:40.106 --> 30:42.508
that there's some
progress, at least...

30:42.541 --> 30:44.510
Okay, there is some progress.

30:44.543 --> 30:48.948
I'm sorry, I wish
I could tell you more.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.120
Mr. Hughes,

30:54.153 --> 30:57.456
I see you got
your wife's art back.

30:57.489 --> 31:01.961
I liked the way she wrote, uh,
"Jordan" in all of her pieces.

31:01.994 --> 31:04.163
I'm surprised you saw that.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.164
No one ever has.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.967
I was looking a little
closer than most people.

31:08.000 --> 31:14.941
She spent so much time
alone in her studio...

31:14.974 --> 31:16.275
it was her way
of talking to me.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.165
ALAN:
Hey, Charlie.

31:39.198 --> 31:40.166
Hi.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.067
Look who's here.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.601
Hi.

31:42.634 --> 31:45.637
Hey, Amita.

31:45.671 --> 31:48.274
Wow, talk about
inflation.

31:48.307 --> 31:50.109
Oh.

31:50.142 --> 31:52.411
I just wanted to see how that
robbery case turned out,

31:52.444 --> 31:54.446
the one that I did the
video enhancements for.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.615
Same case-- turned out
to be counterfeiting,

31:56.648 --> 31:59.185
and there may be a hidden
message in this bill.

31:59.218 --> 32:00.652
What kind of message would
counterfeiters

32:00.686 --> 32:02.154
put on their money?

32:02.188 --> 32:03.322
Not counterfeiters--

32:03.355 --> 32:06.092
the artist they kidnapped
to copy the bills for them.

32:06.125 --> 32:09.261
She put hidden messages
to her husband in her art.

32:09.295 --> 32:10.196
Maybe she put something

32:10.229 --> 32:12.198
in here to tell us
where they've got her.

32:12.231 --> 32:13.332
Interesting.

32:13.365 --> 32:17.503
Well, have fun,
you two.

32:17.536 --> 32:20.172
Well, what about these
points that you've marked?

32:20.206 --> 32:23.542
Oh, intentional flaws--
clues, I think.

32:23.575 --> 32:26.578
I've found 27 flaws
all along this watermark.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.348
It looks like you've gone over
the surface pretty thoroughly.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.450
I've checked both
front and back.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.085
In combinatorics,

32:33.119 --> 32:36.455
we often consider the angle
of observation.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.057
Have you done that yet?

32:49.735 --> 32:51.537
I found Margo Hughes's message.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.439
It was hidden in
the counterfeit bills!

32:56.075 --> 32:58.244
Margo Hughes hid
her husband's name

32:58.277 --> 33:00.646
in her artwork--
a way of talking to him.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.481
She's now talking to us.

33:04.383 --> 33:07.119
She's placed flaws
in this watermark,

33:07.153 --> 33:09.755
that are hard to find,
but easy to isolate.

33:09.788 --> 33:12.191
Now, she needed to be careful.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.559
She didn't want
the counterfeiters

33:13.592 --> 33:16.128
seeing these flaws,
so she put together

33:16.162 --> 33:19.598
a graphic projection that
looks something like this.

33:19.631 --> 33:22.068
Looking straight on,
what does this look like?

33:22.101 --> 33:23.802
Just a bunch
of different thick lines.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.572
Angle it, get an edge on view...

33:26.605 --> 33:28.274
It makes a word.

33:28.307 --> 33:31.177
Using the same principle, I was
able to mathematically perform

33:31.210 --> 33:32.611
the same process
with the watermark.

33:35.314 --> 33:37.216
I unfortunately
just haven't

33:37.249 --> 33:39.785
been able to crack
this code yet.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.487
1738... 52.

33:41.520 --> 33:45.424
DON: Look, maybe it's not a
code.

33:45.457 --> 33:48.094
We don't know it's a code,
right? It could be something

33:48.127 --> 33:49.095
much more simple.

33:49.128 --> 33:50.229
Let me see Zakarian's file.

33:50.262 --> 33:51.197
Who's that?

33:51.230 --> 33:53.365
He's an old-time counterfeiter.
Terry and I

33:53.399 --> 33:54.666
spoke with him.

33:58.404 --> 34:00.639
Here. I thought
the number sounded familiar.

34:00.672 --> 34:03.275
Zakarian owns
a warehouse in Highland Park.

34:03.309 --> 34:04.410
The address is 1738 52nd Street.

34:04.443 --> 34:05.311
Whoa.

34:05.344 --> 34:06.378
Hold on, Terry.

34:06.412 --> 34:07.579
Remember what
I said about

34:07.613 --> 34:09.415
the counterfeiters'
profile being

34:09.448 --> 34:11.217
an older influence,
contending with younger,

34:11.250 --> 34:12.351
- more volatile...
- Zakarian's sons.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.652
The family bond
would explain

34:13.685 --> 34:15.421
what's kept them
together for so long.

34:15.454 --> 34:16.555
All right. Let's pick 'em up.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.099
( yells )

34:27.133 --> 34:28.300
Come on!

34:28.334 --> 34:30.236
What is this?!

34:30.269 --> 34:32.404
This is your
sons holding

34:32.438 --> 34:33.272
a woman hostage.

34:33.305 --> 34:34.806
This is six homicides.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.243
I'm totally lost here.

34:37.276 --> 34:38.877
You've seen my record.

34:38.910 --> 34:42.448
Even back in the day,
I was strictly nonviolent.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.316
Maybe you are,
but your sons aren't.

34:44.350 --> 34:45.451
What's it
gonna be?

34:45.484 --> 34:47.619
You gave us Blanchard's name,
then you had your sons

34:47.653 --> 34:49.388
kill him before
we could talk to him.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.723
You were hoping we'd pin this
all on Blanchard. Case closed.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.359
That's it.
I'm done talking to you.

34:53.392 --> 34:54.393
We know about
your warehouse.

34:54.426 --> 34:57.196
Matter of fact, right now,

34:57.229 --> 35:00.366
we have an FBI SWAT team
moving into position.

35:00.399 --> 35:01.667
Lot of guns, Eddie.
Sharpshooters.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.403
The whole deal.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.373
I was trying to give them
a stake for the future...

35:07.406 --> 35:10.542
slow, patient, small bills,
staying under the radar...

35:10.576 --> 35:11.543
They wanted

35:11.577 --> 35:12.544
a faster payoff...

35:12.578 --> 35:13.645
I tried to tell them--

35:13.679 --> 35:14.813
that's not how you make

35:14.846 --> 35:16.282
a long career
in this business.

35:17.249 --> 35:18.784
They have no patience...

35:18.817 --> 35:20.819
Our team is going
to hit the warehouse.

35:20.852 --> 35:23.322
You know better than anybody,
your sons are going to die

35:23.355 --> 35:24.590
if you
don't help us.

35:26.392 --> 35:28.327
Four men. Zakarian's
sons and two more.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.596
All armed, automatic weapons.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.231
They're holding Margo Hughes

35:32.264 --> 35:34.800
on the rooftop level
of the warehouse.

35:34.833 --> 35:39.205
Basic square
oriented to the north.

35:39.238 --> 35:44.743
Approaching from the south,
you'll see windows.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.912
Directly ahead of you,
near the southwest corner,

35:46.945 --> 35:48.947
is the first entrance.

35:48.980 --> 35:52.618
Inside is a kitchen
and living area.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.357
( television blaring
in Spanish )

35:59.491 --> 36:01.527
DON:
I don't see the hostage.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.928
You stay here.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.796
Right.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.632
Stand by for my go.

36:12.271 --> 36:13.739
MARGO:
Please, no.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.507
I've done everything
you asked.

36:15.541 --> 36:16.742
Please.

36:16.775 --> 36:18.477
On me. Three,
two, one. Execute.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.946
( glass breaking )

36:20.979 --> 36:21.980
( yelling )

36:22.013 --> 36:23.415
( all shouting at once )

36:24.883 --> 36:26.685
- FBI!
- Get down!

36:26.718 --> 36:27.653
( men yelling )

36:28.454 --> 36:29.688
Drop the gun!

36:29.721 --> 36:30.989
Drop dead!

36:31.022 --> 36:32.558
Follow me!

36:32.591 --> 36:33.792
Clear right!

36:33.825 --> 36:34.860
Clear left!

36:34.893 --> 36:36.562
All clear!

36:36.595 --> 36:38.397
All clear.

36:38.430 --> 36:39.398
I got the hostage.

36:39.431 --> 36:40.399
The hostage is safe.

36:40.432 --> 36:41.400
You're going to be
all right.

36:41.433 --> 36:42.601
My name is Don Eppes.

36:42.634 --> 36:45.737
I'm a special agent
with the FBI. It's over.

36:45.771 --> 36:47.673
You all right? You hurt?

36:54.446 --> 36:55.681
Hey, Terry. We got Margo.

36:55.714 --> 36:56.715
She's alive.

36:56.748 --> 36:57.883
Call her husband.

37:00.386 --> 37:03.322
MAN:
Hey!

37:03.355 --> 37:04.823
Oh, God!

37:11.029 --> 37:13.265
That's the good part.

37:13.299 --> 37:14.666
Yup.

37:17.035 --> 37:17.703
I forgot how much
I missed that.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.905
It's a good
thing, right?

37:19.938 --> 37:21.006
Yeah.

37:23.775 --> 37:27.513
Everyone's already
at Kinsella's.

37:27.546 --> 37:29.047
Figure the Secret Service
owes the FBI

37:29.080 --> 37:30.849
a few rounds
if you want to come.

37:30.882 --> 37:33.852
Well, actually, I got a bit
of work to do here, so.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.122
Okay.

37:37.155 --> 37:40.959
We are going to trip over
each other again, Don.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.961
If you and Terry
can be partners,

37:42.994 --> 37:45.864
we can at least try to...

37:45.897 --> 37:48.967
Yeah. Definitely.

37:50.068 --> 37:52.003
Okay. Well...

37:52.037 --> 37:54.973
First rounds on me.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.074
Good night,
Terry.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.042
Good night.

37:58.510 --> 38:00.479
More interagency politics?

38:07.953 --> 38:11.657
( television playing )

38:17.863 --> 38:18.830
( knocking )

38:18.864 --> 38:20.832
CHARLIE:
Don?

38:22.000 --> 38:23.635
Charlie?

38:25.471 --> 38:26.638
You all right?

38:28.807 --> 38:29.708
Hey.

38:30.809 --> 38:31.977
I found this box.

38:32.010 --> 38:32.944
I thought I'd...

38:32.978 --> 38:35.681
What? Bring it over
at 2:00 in the morning?

38:35.714 --> 38:37.015
Yeah.

38:37.048 --> 38:39.851
What did you do?
You opened it?

38:39.885 --> 38:41.052
What is with you, man?

38:41.086 --> 38:43.355
Even when we were kids,
you were always

38:43.389 --> 38:44.890
going through
my stuff.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.658
You always had cool stuff.

38:56.868 --> 39:00.038
Seems like you left a lot
of good friends back there, huh?

39:01.907 --> 39:04.009
Yeah, well.

39:04.042 --> 39:07.145
Family first. Right?

39:07.178 --> 39:08.346
Right.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.894
Look, I was going to tell
you. I just...

39:22.928 --> 39:26.031
I don't know.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.066
I mean, we were
in two different worlds.

39:28.099 --> 39:29.067
You know how it is.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.037
And Mom
got sick and...

39:32.070 --> 39:33.839
I don't know.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.145
I understand.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.584
Yeah?

39:45.617 --> 39:47.453
Yeah.

39:47.486 --> 39:50.856
I agree. We're from... uh,
from two different worlds.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.429
Well, not so much lately.

39:57.463 --> 39:59.898
Yeah.

39:59.931 --> 40:01.600
See me all the time now.

40:02.834 --> 40:03.669
Mmm.

40:05.103 --> 40:07.706
I've learned
a lot from you, actually.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.977
Thanks.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.013
Okay.

40:16.648 --> 40:18.617
You want to watch
the rest of the movie?

40:18.650 --> 40:19.818
Okay. Sure.

40:19.851 --> 40:23.088
It's a great flick.

40:23.121 --> 40:24.556
It's about baseball.

40:25.991 --> 40:29.094
The most statistically-
driven sport in the world.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.562
You want a beer?

40:31.997 --> 40:33.031
No, thanks.

40:34.165 --> 40:35.634
Chip?

40:35.667 --> 40:36.802
I'm okay.
