01:00.435 --> 01:02.395
Dad, thanks for taking
me to the park.

01:02.812 --> 01:05.648
Sure, kiddo. I'll whip us up
some sandwiches.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.358
Then it's lunchtime.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.236
Great! I'm gonna
play with my toys
until we eat.

Hoo-whee!

01:24.918 --> 01:29.047
It sure is one super sunny,
splendiferous day.

01:29.297 --> 01:32.300
Uh-huh. It's baa-eautiful.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.803
Doc, it is so nice outside,

01:34.886 --> 01:37.972
I think it's giving me
a funny feeling inside.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.850
Is that feeling happiness?

01:42.060 --> 01:44.646
Yeah! I think it is.

01:45.104 --> 01:47.607
Hey, everybody,
it's a space ball!

01:47.857 --> 01:50.068
We should play a game
of astronaut ball.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.778
Well, how do you play?

01:51.861 --> 01:55.115
The first thing
we need to do is put on
our space helmets.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.325
Oh, no! I don't have
a space helmet.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.078
You don't need
a real space helmet.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.122
You can just use
a pretend one.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.791
[grunts,

02:05.041 --> 02:06.376
[imitates beeping]

Here! Let me put on
your helmet.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.755
[imitates air whooshing]

02:11.089 --> 02:12.340
Yo, what about me?

02:12.423 --> 02:15.301
You got any space helmets
that fit on dump trucks
over here?

02:15.552 --> 02:17.846
Hmm, dump trucks?
Let's see.

02:18.054 --> 02:21.766
Aha! One deluxe dump truck
space helmet coming up!

02:22.100 --> 02:23.476
[imitates air whooshing]

02:23.726 --> 02:26.271
Let's put on
our space helmets, too.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.356
[imitates air whooshing noise]

02:30.150 --> 02:32.610
Now, you all try
to kick the ball

02:32.694 --> 02:34.571
past the giant space dragon

02:34.654 --> 02:36.114
and hit the cosmic bucket.

02:36.364 --> 02:40.869
I wonder who will play
the giant space dragon.

02:40.952 --> 02:45.373
Me! Me! Pick me!
I'd be a great giant
space dragon!

02:45.456 --> 02:46.541
[all laughing]

02:46.624 --> 02:48.418
Hmm, I don't know.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.337
Hallie would make
a great space dragon.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.839
[stammering in disbelief]

02:52.922 --> 02:54.340
Kidding, kidding.

02:54.424 --> 02:58.386
There's no better
giant space dragon
in the whole universe.

02:58.469 --> 03:01.014
Okay. Try to get it past me.

03:01.097 --> 03:04.017
Well, this space hippo's
gonna kick it as hard

03:04.100 --> 03:06.811
as a mad, mad meteor.

your best space shot.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.656
[Stuffy yells]

03:19.073 --> 03:22.493
Yes! No one can beat
the giant space dragon.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.787
Why don't you let me
have a try?

03:25.121 --> 03:27.081
Bring it on, McStuffins.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.668
[grunts]

03:30.752 --> 03:33.046

[Doc] Oh, no!

03:33.463 --> 03:35.381
Stuffy, are you okay?

03:35.590 --> 03:37.300
[Stuffy] Ow!
Ow! Ow!

03:37.383 --> 03:41.137
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to knock you into the bushes.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.680
[moans]

03:43.389 --> 03:47.018
[gasps] Stuffy,
what happened to you?

03:47.101 --> 03:49.395
You've got
all sorts of bumps

03:49.479 --> 03:50.939
all over you.

03:51.022 --> 03:51.940
You must have

03:52.023 --> 03:53.816
some sort of
bumpy bumps disease.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.026
I don't think

03:55.109 --> 03:56.694
you have bumpy
bumps disease.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.363
When you landed
in the bushes...

03:58.446 --> 03:59.364
Ow!
...you got

03:59.447 --> 04:00.657
these burs
all over you.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.825
Burs? What are those?

04:02.909 --> 04:04.702
Burs are plant seeds

04:04.786 --> 04:06.246
that get stuck
in your clothes.

04:06.454 --> 04:09.249
Since Stuffy is
made of cloth,
they stuck to him.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.793
Ow! Ow! They're
poking me, Doc.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.127
They're poking me.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.004
And it hurts
every time I move.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.505
Is there anything

04:16.589 --> 04:18.007
I could do to help?

04:18.091 --> 04:20.051
We need to take
Stuffy to the fort

04:20.134 --> 04:21.594
and set up
a hospital bed.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.514
Do you think you can be
an ambulance for Stuffy?

04:24.597 --> 04:27.684
Hey! I'll be a real good
ambulance over here.

04:28.142 --> 04:30.144
[Buddy imitating siren]

04:30.228 --> 04:33.189
[Stuffy] Ow! Hey! Uh, well,
take it easy up there.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.440
You got passengers.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.526
Oh, I'm sorry, Stuffy.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.361
I'll drive very carefully

04:38.444 --> 04:39.696
the rest of the way.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.156
[imitating siren]

04:48.037 --> 04:48.871
Hi, Dad.

04:48.955 --> 04:49.956
Hey, Doc.

04:53.835 --> 04:54.836
[whistles]

04:55.545 --> 04:56.379
Whoa!

04:56.462 --> 04:58.256
Ow! Ow. Hey!

04:59.590 --> 05:01.175
Ow.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.929
[Lambie] Oh! I think
you need a cuddle.

05:05.263 --> 05:08.016
No! It'll hurt
even more if you
give me a cuddle.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.017
[all gasp]

05:09.100 --> 05:11.561
It hurts too much
to cuddle?

05:11.644 --> 05:14.480
Oh! We got
to fix him. Stat.

05:14.731 --> 05:15.732
It might hurt

05:15.815 --> 05:17.150
a teensy,
tiny, little bit

05:17.233 --> 05:18.568
when I remove
each bur,

05:18.651 --> 05:20.778
but it'll be over
before you know it.

05:21.195 --> 05:23.448
Can you be a brave
dragon for me?

05:23.656 --> 05:26.617
I can try. I think so.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.703
M--maybe?

05:29.287 --> 05:31.205
You can do it,
Stuffy.

05:31.289 --> 05:34.167
You are the bravest
dragon I know.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.670
But isn't he the only
dragon you kno--

05:38.546 --> 05:40.631
Okay, here we go.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.383
Ow. Ow. Ow!

05:42.467 --> 05:45.011
Stuffy, I haven't even
touched you yet.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.847
Oh, right. Sorry.
[chuckles weakly]

05:48.056 --> 05:49.974
Brave dragon,

Ooh, I can hardly watch!

05:55.063 --> 05:58.441
Oh, shucks.
I can't watch neither.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.652
I think you two
could use a cuddle.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.237
Mm-hmm. Yeah...

06:03.321 --> 06:04.572
Thanks, Lambie.

06:05.573 --> 06:06.449

06:13.039 --> 06:15.374
Hoo-whee! I never
would have guessed

06:15.458 --> 06:17.919
one dragon could have
so many burs.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.379
That's the last one.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.256
All the burs
are gone.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.966
-All right!
-Good job, Doc!

06:25.301 --> 06:27.929
It doesn't hurt
when I move now.

06:28.137 --> 06:32.475
Ooh! That means you're
ready for a big cuddle!

06:32.558 --> 06:33.768
Thanks, Lambie.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.728
Your cuddles
are the best.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.231
That was the worst case
of Un-bur-able Burs

06:38.314 --> 06:39.732
I've ever seen.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.317

your space helmet.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.375
Uh, I don't know, Doc.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.544
Are you sure I'm okay?

06:59.627 --> 07:01.921
Yup. I got
all the burs off.

07:02.004 --> 07:05.091

well, maybe I need a checkup

07:05.174 --> 07:06.384

need to check?

Just one more thing.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.732
Stuffy, I need to check

08:02.815 --> 08:05.693
if you're still an awesome
giant space dragon.

08:05.776 --> 08:09.322
Can you give me a great,
big giant space dragon roar?

08:14.035 --> 08:16.621
but you might need
some roar therapy.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.623
Stuffy,
my prescription

08:18.706 --> 08:20.625
for you is
to go out and play.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.084
[Lambie]
Let's go play!

08:22.168 --> 08:23.920
[Buddy] All right,
Stuffy!

08:24.170 --> 08:26.964
Thanks, Doc.
That's... great.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.549
Come on, Stuffy.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.469
[Buddy] Now we can get back
to playing astronaut ball.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.222
What's up, Doc?

08:34.304 --> 08:36.724
I couldn't find anything
wrong with Stuffy,

08:36.974 --> 08:39.101
but I'm still
worried about him.

08:39.184 --> 08:42.020
He's not acting like
he feels better.

08:42.104 --> 08:45.066
He doesn't seem his normal
dragony self, does he?

08:45.149 --> 08:46.192
Not at all!

08:46.275 --> 08:48.736
Let's keep
an eye on him, okay?

08:48.819 --> 08:51.364
This hippo's gonna keep
both eyes on Stuffy,

08:51.447 --> 08:54.784
like two potato flies
on sweet potato pies.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.536
Now that the giant

08:56.619 --> 08:58.329
space dragon is
healthy again,

08:58.412 --> 09:02.208
it's time for
more astronaut ball!

09:02.291 --> 09:04.126
Yeah! I can't wait to see

09:04.210 --> 09:06.420
if I can kick it
past Stuffy.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.755
No, thanks.

09:07.838 --> 09:10.424
Maybe one of you
should be the giant
space dragon.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.552
Hey, what are you
talking about?

09:12.885 --> 09:15.179
I just don't feel
like playing anymore.

09:15.596 --> 09:18.516
But no one can be
the giant space dragon

09:18.599 --> 09:19.850
like you can.

09:20.142 --> 09:22.478
I said, I don't
want to play!

09:24.230 --> 09:25.565
Come here, Stuffy.

09:26.816 --> 09:30.236
As your doctor, I can't
find anything wrong with you.

09:30.319 --> 09:34.323
But as your friend, I can see
something's bothering you.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.534
[sighs]
It's nothing.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.786
You always love to play.

09:39.453 --> 09:41.497
So why don't you
want to play today?

09:41.581 --> 09:43.624
[sighs] It's just...

09:44.333 --> 09:46.002
What if I get
hurt again?

09:46.085 --> 09:47.336
Oh, Stuffy,

09:47.420 --> 09:50.172
I know it wasn't
any fun getting hurt.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.174
No fun at all.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.884
But you're
all better now.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.178
People and toys
get hurt sometimes,

09:56.262 --> 09:58.598
and it's important to be
careful when we play.

09:58.931 --> 10:02.226
But that doesn't mean
we should stop doing
the things we love.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.894
That's right,
Sugar lumps.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.813
One time, I
dropped a chair

10:05.896 --> 10:07.565
on my toe while
I was helping

10:07.648 --> 10:09.191
Doc give
a checkup.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.193
But I love being
a nurse.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.195
So I'm never
gonna stop.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.572
And remember the time

10:14.655 --> 10:16.866
when I cuddled
that toy porcupine?

10:17.283 --> 10:21.203
That hurt,
but I just learned to be
more careful next time.

[Lambie] Whoo-hoo! [chuckles]
Helmets on!

11:12.588 --> 11:14.632
[Hallie] Okay,
giant space dragon,

11:14.715 --> 11:17.593
this here hippo's
hankering for a rematch.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.387
[grunts]
Oh!

11:19.804 --> 11:20.638
[all gasp]

11:20.721 --> 11:23.265
Oh, no!
Stuffy?

11:23.349 --> 11:24.392
Are you okay?

11:24.767 --> 11:27.978
You know what?
I am okay.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.064
But did you see
that block?

11:30.147 --> 11:33.359
It was amazing!
[laughs]

11:33.651 --> 11:35.653
Sorry I knocked you
down, Sugar.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.696
Don't worry about it,
Hallie.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.865
Let the dragon show you
how it's done.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.242
Now, that sounds

11:41.325 --> 11:43.285
like the dragon
we all know and love.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.788
Now you be the giant
space dragon.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.623
You got it, Stuffy!

11:48.707 --> 11:50.084

11:50.167 --> 11:51.502
Whoa!

11:51.585 --> 11:53.295

12:00.428 --> 12:01.512
It's good to have

12:01.595 --> 12:04.056
our good old
super-fun Stuffy back.

12:04.140 --> 12:07.893
[laughs]
It's good to be back, Doc.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.979
It's good
to be back.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.106
[all laughing]

12:15.901 --> 12:17.361
[Doc reading]

12:20.781 --> 12:21.657
Hi, guys.

12:21.740 --> 12:22.992
Hey, ya, Doc!
Hello there!

12:23.826 --> 12:26.454
Ooh, the garden!
What are we growing?

12:26.537 --> 12:27.455
I'll show you.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.168
Ah! My nose!

12:32.251 --> 12:34.503
What was it doing
buried in the ground?

12:34.587 --> 12:38.132
[panting]
I-- I can't breathe
without my nose.

12:38.215 --> 12:41.302
No, no, Chilly.
This is a real carrot.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.929
Your nose is right there
on your face,

12:44.513 --> 12:45.681
cute as ever.

12:45.973 --> 12:49.059
Oh! That was
very upsetting.

12:49.351 --> 12:50.728
I need a cuddle.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.274
Hello?
Looking for
a cuddle here.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.610
Lambie, that's
your cuddle cue!

12:58.027 --> 12:59.069
Where's Lambie?

12:59.153 --> 13:00.154
I don't know.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.239
Wait.
She's not here?

13:02.698 --> 13:04.700
Oh, no. Did I drop her?

13:05.659 --> 13:06.911
We have to find her.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.205
Lambie?
Where are you?

13:09.288 --> 13:10.456
[Donny] Here I come!

13:11.040 --> 13:12.416
-Guys!
-Go stuffed!

13:12.500 --> 13:13.834
Way ahead
of you, Doc.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.921
Doc, look who I found!

13:17.213 --> 13:19.924
Lambie. Let me have her.
Sure.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.676
-Aah! Whoa!
-Donny!

13:23.928 --> 13:27.014
Don't worry. Awesome Guy
will save her.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.641
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Ba da da da ♪</span>

13:28.724 --> 13:32.394
Whoosh! Awesome Guy
to the rescue!

13:32.853 --> 13:34.104
Hold on, Lambie!

13:34.188 --> 13:36.106
[Mom] Donny, it's time
for your play date.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.192
Okay, Mom. I'll be
right there.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.486
You'll have to
save Lambie.
Okay.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.988
But here's Awesome Guy
if you need any help.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.114
Great!

13:45.157 --> 13:47.034
Come on, toys.
Let's get unstuffed.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.290
Oh! Aah!

13:53.707 --> 13:56.043
Don't worry, Lambie.
I'm gonna save you.

13:56.460 --> 14:00.214
[gasps] Is that-- ooh! --who
I think it is?

14:00.297 --> 14:02.049
It's a doll,
it's an action hero!

14:02.424 --> 14:05.636
It's Awesome Guy!
That's me!

14:05.719 --> 14:08.889
Check this guy out!
The big muscles...
[laughs]

14:08.973 --> 14:10.641
The strong chin.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.351
[chuckles]
He was made to save.

14:12.434 --> 14:13.394
You've read my book.

14:13.477 --> 14:17.314
Ooh, I always wanted
to be saved by a super hero.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.024
Then I'm your guy!

14:19.108 --> 14:20.776
[sighs]
You're awesome.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.486
Indeed I am.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.364
Awesome Guy to the rescue!

14:25.447 --> 14:27.074
Just let go, little lamb.

14:27.157 --> 14:30.286
My pleasure. Whee!

14:30.744 --> 14:33.038
[laughs] Awesome, right?

14:33.122 --> 14:34.039
-Aah!
-Oops.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.458
What happened?

14:36.542 --> 14:40.045
Lambie has been saved
by Awesome Guy!

14:40.129 --> 14:41.463
That's me. [laughs]

14:41.547 --> 14:44.550
That wasn't exactly
the save of my dreams.

14:44.842 --> 14:48.095
I pictured it, um,
more romantic

14:48.178 --> 14:50.723
and less painful.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.266
Here we go. Here we go.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.226
Well, that's not
quite right.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.812
Awesome Guy,
are you okay?

14:57.313 --> 15:01.025
Ah, better than okay, Doc.
I'm awesome!

15:01.108 --> 15:02.610
[laughs] Why do you ask?

15:02.985 --> 15:04.612
Well, that wasn't the--

15:04.695 --> 15:06.488
the classic Awesome Guy
we're used to.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.491
See, usually you'd be
all, "I'll save you!

15:09.575 --> 15:11.493
Awesome Guy to the rescue!"

15:11.577 --> 15:13.954
And, you know, you'd
save her. And, well,

15:14.038 --> 15:15.039
you wouldn't
drop anyone.

15:15.414 --> 15:18.626
Right. So if something's
bothering you,

15:18.709 --> 15:21.295
you can tell me.
You know that, right?

15:21.378 --> 15:23.380
I'm Awesome Guy!

15:23.464 --> 15:25.507
That means I'm awesome
at everything.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.842
No problems here.

15:26.926 --> 15:27.801
[chuckles weakly]

15:27.885 --> 15:30.346
Watch! I still have
my awesome speed.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.389
And... go!

15:35.017 --> 15:37.853
Is that how
Awesome Guy
usually runs?

15:37.937 --> 15:41.690
You mean really slow
and all clunky? Uh-uh.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.443
Let's keep our eye
on him just in case

15:44.526 --> 15:45.819
there is
something wrong.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.279
[panting]

15:47.613 --> 15:49.949
I'll prove I'm fine
by showing you

15:50.032 --> 15:51.617
my awesome strength.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.744
Let's see, let's see.

15:54.411 --> 15:57.039
I need... you, truck guy.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.415
What? Me?

15:59.249 --> 16:01.085
Now, that's
the Awesome Guy

16:01.168 --> 16:03.545
that can save me any day.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.590
-Whoa! Down I go!
-Whoa!

16:06.674 --> 16:09.134
Oh, never mind.

16:09.218 --> 16:13.430
Awesome Guy, I've been
a doctor for a long time,

16:13.514 --> 16:15.182
so trust me when I tell you,

16:15.641 --> 16:16.725
you need a checkup.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.727
Yeah. Let Doc take
a look at you...

16:19.019 --> 16:21.021
make sure everything's
working right.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.691
But superheroes
do the saving,

16:23.774 --> 16:25.401
not the other
way around.

16:25.484 --> 16:28.070
[groaning]

16:28.153 --> 16:30.572
I think Awesome Guy
needs your help.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.283
I know, but if he
won't tell me

16:33.367 --> 16:35.202
how he's feeling,
I can't help him.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.663
We have to get him
a checkup.

16:37.746 --> 16:38.872
I have a plan.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.875
[whispering]
So what we do is...

16:41.959 --> 16:43.669
Nah, nothing
wrong with this body.

16:43.752 --> 16:44.753
[laughs]

16:45.129 --> 16:47.715
[Lambie] Help! Help!

16:47.798 --> 16:49.008
[Hallie] Hopping hippos!

16:49.091 --> 16:51.719
We need some... help in here!

16:51.802 --> 16:55.347
This sounds like a job
for Awesome Guy!

16:55.431 --> 16:57.891
[grunting]

16:57.975 --> 16:59.518
Ah! Oh! Easy.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.770
[singsong] Da-da-da!

17:01.854 --> 17:03.647
Awesome Guy is here!

17:03.731 --> 17:05.148
How may I save you?

17:05.232 --> 17:07.651
Oh! [stammering]
There's a bad guy

17:07.734 --> 17:09.028
in the checkup room.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.279
Lead the way.

17:12.321 --> 17:13.615
The Doc is in.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.452
Wait, muscles.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.871
We should listen
for the bad guy, right?

17:18.954 --> 17:21.330
Yes, yes, with my
awesome hearing.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.667
[heart beating]

17:26.837 --> 17:29.590
Uh, am I the only one
who doesn't hear anything?

17:29.673 --> 17:33.260
Oh, um, um, I was
standing, uh,

17:33.343 --> 17:35.387
right here when I saw
the bad guy.

17:35.846 --> 17:39.683
Well, then I shall stand
where you stood
and use my awesome eyesight.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.734
I saw the bad guy.

17:48.817 --> 17:51.737
He was... uh,
flying around
the room,

17:51.820 --> 17:56.408
L-- L-- like this.
Zoom, zoom, zoom.

17:58.035 --> 18:02.039
As far as I can tell,
there are no bad guys here.

18:02.414 --> 18:05.542
And as far as I can tell,
there's nothing wrong with you.

18:08.504 --> 18:12.591
You-- [laughing] Oh, okay.

18:12.674 --> 18:15.636
Did you pretend to need
help just to give me
a checkup?

18:16.011 --> 18:17.721
We did. [laughs]
It was my idea.

18:18.013 --> 18:20.974
You're awesomely strong,
your heart sounds awesome.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.811
And you did an awesome
job following the light.

18:23.894 --> 18:27.231
What can I say?
I am awesome.

18:29.900 --> 18:33.987
Watch as I crush this ball
with my awesome strength!

18:34.905 --> 18:35.989
[grunting] Ah!

18:36.532 --> 18:38.617
That was just
a cotton ball, right?

18:38.700 --> 18:42.287
Yeah. But he looks
so good doing it.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.499
The thing is, Awesome Guy,
I've been watching you.

18:45.582 --> 18:48.502
And I don't think your
legs are working right.

18:48.585 --> 18:52.047
Like I said before,
Doc, I feel awesome.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.716
Thanks for
the checkup. Ta-ta!

18:54.800 --> 18:56.051
I'll show you out, Sugar.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.721
Couldn't find
anything wrong, huh?

18:59.805 --> 19:02.850
No. But I can't help if
he won't tell me about it.

19:05.727 --> 19:06.895
Awesome Guy,

19:06.979 --> 19:09.898
I know what it's like
to want to hide your pain.

19:10.315 --> 19:14.653
As a brave dragon,

well, brave.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.197
But everyone needs
help sometimes...

19:17.656 --> 19:19.283
[groans] like now!

19:19.616 --> 19:24.163
I need help 'cause my tail
is stuck in the door.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.207
[grunts] No!

19:28.083 --> 19:29.209
Can't get it!

19:29.293 --> 19:31.628
Awesome Guy,
you need help.

19:31.879 --> 19:35.382
Doc can help,
but not if you
won't let her.

19:35.465 --> 19:36.884
That's right, muscles.

[sighs]
I guess I do need help.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.304
[Stuffy] So do I.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.349
Tail still stuck in door!

20:26.266 --> 20:27.267
[relieved sigh]

20:27.809 --> 20:30.687
Awesome Guy, are you ready
to tell me how you feel?

20:31.396 --> 20:35.400
Truth is, I have
an awesome pain
in my legs.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.194
Now we're talking.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.988
Why don't we go back
and I'll take a look?

20:41.114 --> 20:43.242
I guess I always
thought

20:43.325 --> 20:45.452
I was supposed
to help everyone
else,

20:45.827 --> 20:47.329
not the other
way around.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.915
Everyone needs help,
Awesome Guy.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.584
It's true.
And asking for it

20:52.668 --> 20:54.294
doesn't mean
you're not awesome.

20:54.628 --> 20:55.712
Now you tell me!

20:56.046 --> 20:58.882
So when did the pain
in your legs start?

20:58.966 --> 20:59.967
Let's see,

21:00.384 --> 21:02.261
<span style="style.default_1">I was saving Sir Kirby.</span>

21:03.428 --> 21:05.430
<span style="style.default_1">Of course,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I saved Sir Kirby,</span>

21:05.514 --> 21:06.932
<span style="style.default_1">only lost my legs.</span>

21:07.266 --> 21:09.851
<span style="style.default_1">Then Donny popped</span>
<span style="style.default_1">my legs back,</span>

21:09.935 --> 21:12.479
and they've felt weird
ever since.

21:12.729 --> 21:14.356
So your legs came off

21:14.439 --> 21:16.650
and then Donny
put them back on?

21:17.401 --> 21:18.902
I have a diagnosis.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.364
You have a case
of Righty-on-lefty Syndrome.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.408
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What does that mean?

21:24.700 --> 21:27.035
It means your legs
are on backwards.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.872
That's going right in
<span style="style.default_1">The Big Book of Boo-boos,</span>

21:30.956 --> 21:32.541
or is it the left?

21:32.624 --> 21:34.793
Doc, can you
save me?

21:34.876 --> 21:36.128
I sure can.

21:36.211 --> 21:37.921
We just pop
your legs off,

21:38.297 --> 21:39.298
switch them around,

21:39.381 --> 21:40.882
and pop them back on again.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.468
Lambie, Stuffy,
you grab that leg,

21:43.552 --> 21:44.511
I'll take this one.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.054
[Stuffy] You got it!
[Lambie] Okie-dokie!

21:46.680 --> 21:48.432
[Doc] Ready?
Ready!

21:49.016 --> 21:52.060
[Lambie grunting]
[squealing] Got it!

21:52.144 --> 21:55.230
Okay. Let's put them back
in the right way.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.482
Hallie, I need
the right leg.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.109
Right leg.

21:59.359 --> 22:00.485
Left leg, please?

22:00.777 --> 22:01.695
Left it is.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.741
That's one and that's two.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.284
Let's give them a try, okay?

22:08.118 --> 22:10.912
Hmm, seems good.

22:10.996 --> 22:14.124
Yeah. Let me test
my awesome strength.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.335
Hallie, I need
a little help.

22:16.418 --> 22:17.919
I'm here for you,
Sugar.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.213
[laughs]
Whoo! Whoo!

22:20.297 --> 22:21.882
So how do you feel?

22:21.965 --> 22:25.802
Awesome.
And I mean that. Ha!

22:26.094 --> 22:29.056
<span style="style.default_1">♪ I feel better</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So much better ♪</span>

<span style="style.default_1">So much better now ♪</span>

22:42.986 --> 22:44.946
My hero.

22:45.363 --> 22:46.239
Whoa!

22:46.323 --> 22:47.783
Oh! Let me get the door.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.367
It's the gentlemanly
thing to do.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.036
Help!
Lambie!

22:51.703 --> 22:54.664
Don't worry, Doc.
This is a job for...

22:54.956 --> 22:56.541
[all others]
Awesome Guy!

22:56.625 --> 22:57.667
To the rescue!

22:58.085 --> 23:00.170
Awesome Guy!

23:00.253 --> 23:01.922
I'm here to save you!

23:04.299 --> 23:05.884
[Lambie screams]

23:06.802 --> 23:09.429
Being saved
by Awesome Guy

23:09.513 --> 23:12.307
was as perfect as
I imagined it would be.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.643
You're my hero.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.561
I have a hero, too.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.980
You do? Who is it?

23:19.439 --> 23:22.609
Doc. She totally saved me.

23:22.692 --> 23:23.944
Thanks, Awesome Guy.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.780
But I couldn't have done
it without your help.

23:26.863 --> 23:28.782
I guess we're
both super heroes.

23:28.865 --> 23:31.076
[all laughing]

23:32.869 --> 23:34.871
Hey, everybody.
It's Doc here.

23:35.622 --> 23:39.334
<span style="style.default_1">When you get tired</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and lose your energy,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">what should you do?</span>

23:39.918 --> 23:42.420
<span style="style.default_1">Should you have a tea party?</span>

23:42.504 --> 23:43.797
[Stuffy slurps]

23:44.464 --> 23:46.216
<span style="style.default_1">Take a nap and recharge?</span>

23:48.218 --> 23:49.678
<span style="style.default_1">Or play basketball?</span>

23:52.389 --> 23:54.307
<span style="style.default_1">That's right!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You should take a nap.</span>

23:56.059 --> 23:59.020
<span style="style.default_1">After you do,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">you can zoom into action.</span>
