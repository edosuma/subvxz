Pushy sign!
Don't tell me what to try!

00:58.363 --> 01:01.799
Homer! Dr. Hibbert told you
to eat healthier!

01:01.833 --> 01:03.067
I don't recall that.

01:03.101 --> 01:04.617
Well, I do.

01:04.652 --> 01:05.636
Eat healthier!

01:05.670 --> 01:08.055
You too, Julius!

01:08.089 --> 01:09.656
I heard you were
at Loretta's Diner

01:09.691 --> 01:10.624
on "Catfish Friday"!

01:10.658 --> 01:12.159
How do you know that?

01:12.193 --> 01:13.494
You got your brother
following me?

01:13.528 --> 01:14.795
Chester needs a job.

01:14.829 --> 01:16.480
I paid him to build a shed!

01:16.514 --> 01:18.982
Where is my shed,
Bernice?

01:19.017 --> 01:20.734
One onion rings, please.

01:23.204 --> 01:24.972
Can I borrow ten bucks
from the cash register?

01:25.006 --> 01:27.007
I've gotta get drunk
before a party.

01:28.276 --> 01:31.011
Excuse me.
A homeless man is

01:31.045 --> 01:32.479
giving himself
a sink bath!

01:35.533 --> 01:38.318
Karate class is here and hungry!

01:38.353 --> 01:40.921
You got any scented candles?

01:46.094 --> 01:49.430
Ow! This is the worst pain
imaginable!

01:49.464 --> 01:51.231
This one's cold.

01:51.266 --> 01:55.803
Mr. Simpson, your injury was
no accidénte,

01:55.837 --> 01:58.272
it was... negligénce.

01:58.306 --> 02:00.107
My burns have affected our...

02:00.141 --> 02:01.558
intimacy...

02:01.593 --> 02:03.977
because all night,
I talk about how much money

02:04.012 --> 02:05.913
I'm going to make
from the lawsuit.

02:05.947 --> 02:08.732
Money? What I am concerned
about is your burns.

02:10.335 --> 02:12.169
They have healed
much too quickly.

02:12.203 --> 02:16.940
Sit still while I give
your head the "third degree."

02:16.975 --> 02:20.577
Oh, God!
It hurts worse than the burns!

02:20.612 --> 02:23.514
Yes, these are
special acid markers.

02:24.766 --> 02:28.902
Homer Simpson, you shall receive
$5,000 after legal fees.

02:28.937 --> 02:30.270
Pay up, Krusty.

02:30.305 --> 02:32.039
It wasn't even my place!

02:32.073 --> 02:34.775
Man, I got a bad lawyer.

02:36.110 --> 02:38.745
So, uh, what are you gonna do
with the money, Homer?

02:38.797 --> 02:40.631
Well, thought bubble
Marge said we should

02:40.665 --> 02:42.549
put it in a college
fund for Lisa.

02:42.584 --> 02:43.934
So where's
the money now?

02:43.968 --> 02:45.652
I put it in the bank.

02:45.687 --> 02:49.139
That place is great!
On their wall, they had a photo

02:49.174 --> 02:51.608
with an old couple walking on
the beach

02:51.643 --> 02:53.143
with their pants rolled up.

02:53.178 --> 02:55.078
Uh, Homer, we all
wanna walk on a beach

02:55.113 --> 02:56.513
with our pants rolled up,

02:56.547 --> 02:59.149
but, uh, banks are not as safe
as they used to be.

02:59.184 --> 03:00.834
Yeah, when you give
the bank your money,

03:00.869 --> 03:02.419
they lend it
to other people!

03:02.453 --> 03:04.438
I saw a <i>Sesame Street</i>
about it!

03:04.489 --> 03:06.673
Kermit was wearing his
trench coat and everything.

03:06.708 --> 03:09.159
Wait, the frog in the trench
coat is Kermit, too?

03:09.194 --> 03:10.978
All the frogs on
that show are Kermit.

03:11.012 --> 03:13.197
Keeps all the other frog
actors out of work.

03:13.231 --> 03:14.832
That settles it.
No banks for me.

03:14.866 --> 03:17.034
I'll tell you where
you should put your money.

03:17.068 --> 03:19.303
The one safe place left in this
world of woe:

03:19.337 --> 03:20.704
What the...?

03:20.738 --> 03:23.707
I'm not gonna gamble
with my daughter's future.

03:23.741 --> 03:25.509
Nah, you don't have
to bet the money.

03:25.543 --> 03:28.145
The poker website just keeps it
nice and safe,

03:28.179 --> 03:30.681
where the FDIC can't get its
grubby little hands on it!

03:30.715 --> 03:34.218
A poker site is now safer
than an American bank.

03:34.252 --> 03:37.988
Has our nation-- built on people
suing because their onion rings

03:38.006 --> 03:40.607
were too hot-- come to this?

03:40.642 --> 03:42.776
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't you badmouth this country.

03:42.810 --> 03:45.012
Compared to the rest
of the Third World,

03:45.046 --> 03:45.913
we're doin' great!

03:45.947 --> 03:47.714
Open file, click and...

03:50.235 --> 03:51.301
...invested!

03:51.336 --> 03:53.203
Hey, Lisa, check out
your college fund!

03:53.238 --> 03:56.139
You put my college fund
on a poker site?!

03:56.174 --> 03:57.808
It's a classy operation.

03:57.842 --> 04:00.177
See? The little dealer's
wearing a bow tie-- cute!

04:00.211 --> 04:02.846
Well...at least I have
a college fund!

04:02.881 --> 04:04.047
On a poker site!

04:04.082 --> 04:05.849
More importantly,
it's a college fund.

04:05.884 --> 04:06.917
On a poker site!

04:06.951 --> 04:08.318
Dad, please!

04:08.353 --> 04:10.120
Sorry. Check out
my new T-shirt.

04:12.790 --> 04:14.391
Where did you get
that shirt?

04:14.425 --> 04:16.026
I've had it
for a long time.

04:16.060 --> 04:18.060
I was just about
to throw it out,

04:18.096 --> 04:19.178
and then this happened.

04:19.213 --> 04:21.765
Mwah!

04:23.801 --> 04:26.270
That's one way
to avoid drunk driving.

04:26.304 --> 04:27.938
Another way is
don't drink.

04:27.972 --> 04:29.673
I'm not Superman.

04:29.707 --> 04:31.975
Homie, do you know
what yesterday was?

04:32.010 --> 04:34.144
Ha! Of course I do!

04:34.178 --> 04:37.514
Happy anni...
birth... entine...

04:37.548 --> 04:39.316
Shark week?

04:39.350 --> 04:43.220
Yesterday's the day we were
supposed to visit Grampa!

04:44.806 --> 04:46.356
What the...?!
Stupid calendar.

04:46.391 --> 04:49.192
First you put the Fourth of July
on Sunday, and now this!

04:49.227 --> 04:52.312
Oh, we're gonna discuss this
later!

04:55.416 --> 04:57.050
Okay, remember the plan:
Apologize to Grampa.

04:57.085 --> 05:00.120
Then when he wants us
to take him out to lunch,

05:00.171 --> 05:01.772
point to the leftovers,

05:01.806 --> 05:03.824
tell him we already did,
but he forgot.

05:03.858 --> 05:05.408
I still feel guilty.

05:05.426 --> 05:08.011
Your father's not going
to be around forever.

05:08.046 --> 05:09.780
Marge, you take that back!

05:09.814 --> 05:11.748
Fine, he'll be
around forever.

05:11.783 --> 05:13.116
You take <i>that</i> back!

05:16.287 --> 05:18.622
We're here to see Abe Simpson.

05:18.656 --> 05:20.123
Abe Simpson?!
Uh, excuse me.

05:23.044 --> 05:25.679
I'm very sorry
to tell you your father...

05:25.713 --> 05:27.447
is missing.

05:27.482 --> 05:30.417
Missing?! What kind of a prison
are you people running here?

05:30.451 --> 05:32.085
If it's any consolation,
we'll probably find him

05:32.120 --> 05:33.720
when the river thaws in
the spring.

05:33.755 --> 05:36.556
A lot of bobbers then.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.237
There's gotta be a clue
in here somewhere.

05:42.271 --> 05:47.893
Spats, sock garters, the world's
hardest hard candy...

05:50.446 --> 05:51.646
Oh, it's hopeless!

05:51.681 --> 05:54.683
This room is like a museum
of meaningless old crap.

05:54.717 --> 05:57.319
By which I mean
every museum.

05:57.353 --> 05:59.020
Grampa's army footlocker!

05:59.055 --> 06:01.256
I bet the most important things
in the world

06:01.290 --> 06:03.191
to him are in this box!

06:03.226 --> 06:05.026
So precious...

06:09.565 --> 06:11.666
Look at that,
a man's whole life

06:11.701 --> 06:14.035
being kicked around
on the floor.

06:14.070 --> 06:16.238
"Spiro's...

06:16.272 --> 06:18.673
The place that changed
my life..."

06:18.708 --> 06:21.510
Flimsy lead,
take me away!

06:21.544 --> 06:25.280
Okay, baby,
let's see the flop.

06:25.314 --> 06:26.865
Damn it! Lost again.

06:32.388 --> 06:35.223
Are you playing poker
with my college fund?

06:35.258 --> 06:37.359
I'm only down $62.

06:37.393 --> 06:38.960
Not counting my tips
to the waitresses.

06:42.999 --> 06:45.634
Get your hands off
my future!

06:45.668 --> 06:48.904
Fine, fine.

06:48.938 --> 06:51.289
New low, even for this family.

06:51.324 --> 06:53.024
College fund on a poker site.

06:53.059 --> 06:54.199
I'm just gonna log right out.

06:54.224 --> 06:55.099
Hm.

06:55.860 --> 06:57.390
Get out of here!

06:58.849 --> 07:01.117
Huh. Two queens.

07:01.152 --> 07:03.453
That's a great start.

07:03.487 --> 07:07.557
Well, maybe I can just win
the $62 back.

07:11.195 --> 07:14.831
Four queens! Yes! Yes...!

07:14.865 --> 07:16.132
Gambling, eh?

07:16.167 --> 07:18.301
Satan's most potent
recruiting tool!

07:18.335 --> 07:22.072
All due respect, Mr. Flanders,
could I have a little privacy?

07:22.106 --> 07:24.808
Please?

07:24.842 --> 07:26.209
Thank you.

07:34.285 --> 07:37.270
Yeah! $50 up!

07:37.304 --> 07:40.607
Time to play with house money!

07:40.641 --> 07:42.624
Or time to walk away
from the table.

07:42.649 --> 07:44.649
Shoo!

07:44.979 --> 07:46.763
How did he...?

07:46.797 --> 07:50.383
Can't let Lisa lose her
sense of wonder.

08:04.882 --> 08:07.834
Excuse me,
have you seen this man?

08:07.868 --> 08:10.136
We don't like
questions, man.

08:10.171 --> 08:12.338
Yeah, but I'm just trying
to get information,

08:12.373 --> 08:15.208
like a nosey reporter
or an undercover cop.

08:15.242 --> 08:16.409
What'd he say
about a cop?

08:16.443 --> 08:18.812
Or a spy from a rival gang?

08:18.846 --> 08:19.813
Hey, what are you doing?

08:24.418 --> 08:26.452
Abe Simpson...
used to work here.

08:26.487 --> 08:27.453
Put him down!

08:27.488 --> 08:28.488
Ow!

08:32.458 --> 08:33.293
Welcome to Spiro's!

08:33.327 --> 08:35.227
I am Spiro.

08:35.261 --> 08:37.163
Not the Spiro on the sign.
That's my brother.

08:37.198 --> 08:39.164
Did you say my dad
worked here?

08:39.200 --> 08:40.900
Yes, in the old days.

08:40.934 --> 08:44.571
When people ate steak, drank
champagne, and the music...

08:44.605 --> 08:48.508
oh, the music!
I hated the music!

08:59.670 --> 09:01.571
Hmm...

09:03.774 --> 09:05.408
Simpson! I pay you
to clean tables,

09:05.442 --> 09:07.010
not to write songs.

09:07.044 --> 09:08.444
And you, Marvin Hamlisch,

09:08.479 --> 09:10.780
I pay you to write songs,
not to clean tables!

09:10.814 --> 09:13.116
What can I say?
I like to pitch in.

♪ My heart does

09:24.912 --> 09:27.580

songwriter like Charles Manson?

09:33.604 --> 09:35.171
I never knew that.

09:37.124 --> 09:39.776
You know who would sound good
singing that song?

09:39.810 --> 09:41.110
Me.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.730
Rita Lafleur singing
one of my tunes?!

09:43.764 --> 09:47.217

you can see everything!
Disgusting!

10:05.502 --> 10:06.569
You're fired!

10:06.604 --> 10:07.971
Hey, you can't
do that!

10:08.005 --> 10:10.173
I just turned sweet on him!
Yeah!

10:10.207 --> 10:12.325
Be sweet on him in
your own sweet time!

10:12.359 --> 10:14.160
Why did I ever leave Greece?

10:14.194 --> 10:16.162
Oh, that's right,
'cause it's a train wreck.

10:17.214 --> 10:19.415
I never saw
either of them again.

10:19.450 --> 10:21.517

Papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolop
odopotopolis.

10:30.361 --> 10:31.995
Now, what was that
singer's name again?

10:32.029 --> 10:33.263
Rita Lafleur.

10:33.297 --> 10:35.498
Rita La-what?

10:35.532 --> 10:36.499
Lafleur.

10:36.533 --> 10:37.800
One more time.

10:37.835 --> 10:39.869
Ugh! I'll write it
down for you.

10:39.903 --> 10:43.940
Thank you Mr. Papadapaconstanti-
kasgianopolop odopotopolis.

10:45.042 --> 10:46.009
There's exactly
one Rita Lafleur

10:46.043 --> 10:48.211
living in Springfield!

10:48.245 --> 10:49.796
That's where <i>we</i> live!

10:49.830 --> 10:52.065
Hello?
Rita Lafleur?

10:52.099 --> 10:54.801
Did you know a man
named Abe Simpson?

10:54.835 --> 10:55.935
Know him?

10:55.970 --> 10:57.203
I'm married to him.

10:58.339 --> 11:00.473
Homer, she's married
to your dad!

11:00.507 --> 11:03.443
Whoo-hoo!
I get two Christmases!

11:04.877 --> 11:06.876
I've read
every expert on poker,

11:06.901 --> 11:09.067
and watched
Jennifer Tilly's DVD.

11:09.092 --> 11:10.644
Start with your senses Marnie.

11:10.669 --> 11:12.358
Use the little girl voice,

11:12.383 --> 11:14.397
and take them
for everything they've got.

11:15.078 --> 11:18.308
Now, I'm need on the set
of Bride of Chucky V.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.393
Time is money.

11:20.418 --> 11:21.784
Money is money.

11:21.809 --> 11:24.424
And money is college,
which can lead to more money

11:24.449 --> 11:26.533
someday, but who knows
anymore.

11:52.898 --> 11:54.732
Tim, what are you doing?

11:54.767 --> 11:56.034
Bible trivia.

11:56.068 --> 11:58.503
You've been doing that
an awful lot lately.

11:58.537 --> 12:01.339
The Bible is rich with trivia!

12:01.373 --> 12:04.592
I can't believe my Dad never
told me he had another wife.

12:04.626 --> 12:07.345
The man I looked up to
my whole life.

12:07.379 --> 12:09.180
You never looked up to him.

12:09.214 --> 12:11.115
Well, it's a good thing I didn't

12:11.150 --> 12:13.434
because I'd be pretty
devastated right now.

12:14.470 --> 12:16.204
I can't believe
you're here.

12:16.238 --> 12:18.239
I'd finally gotten over
your father

12:18.273 --> 12:21.376
just a week-and-a-half ago,
and then you two show up.

12:21.410 --> 12:23.978
Well, we certainly don't want
to cause you any more pain.

12:24.012 --> 12:26.647
But we need to know everything,
no matter how shameful.

12:26.682 --> 12:27.749
And fast!

12:27.783 --> 12:30.451
I understand,
but this is hard.

12:30.486 --> 12:31.652
Yeah.

12:31.687 --> 12:34.655
Well, just what attracted
you to my father?

12:34.690 --> 12:37.258
Beneath his mediocrity
there was genius.

12:37.292 --> 12:39.227
Then a layer of anger.

12:39.261 --> 12:41.329
Then a beautiful soul.

12:41.363 --> 12:43.881
Then some more anger!

12:43.916 --> 12:46.334
A lot of layers.

12:55.844 --> 12:59.097
<i>After we were fired from</i>
<i>Spiro's, we teamed up...</i>

12:59.131 --> 13:01.399
<i>for more than music.</i>

13:01.433 --> 13:05.136
Oh, Abe!

13:05.170 --> 13:06.771
Yeah!

13:06.805 --> 13:10.174
<i>Mm, that kind of romance</i>
<i>leads to children.</i>

13:10.209 --> 13:12.777
<i>Faster than you'd think.</i>

13:12.811 --> 13:14.946
I was alive when
my Dad knew you?

13:14.980 --> 13:17.482
Alive, but very clueless.

13:17.516 --> 13:20.685
So this was <i>after</i>
Homer's mother left?

13:20.719 --> 13:22.954
I love men on the rebound.

13:22.988 --> 13:25.256
They always think they've done
something wrong

13:25.290 --> 13:27.191
and they usually come
with furniture.

13:27.226 --> 13:29.861
My Dad had furniture?!

13:29.895 --> 13:32.864
I don't know him at all!

13:32.898 --> 13:35.850
<i>One day, when we were</i>
<i>walking through Proposal Park,</i>

13:35.884 --> 13:38.436
<i>Abe popped the question.</i>

13:38.470 --> 13:40.338
<i>We got married</i>
<i>in the city hall,</i>

13:40.372 --> 13:44.175
<i>across from the prettiest</i>
<i>church you ever seen.</i>

13:46.011 --> 13:47.378
<i>Then tragedy struck.</i>

14:00.492 --> 14:03.661
<i>Hey, I'm starting to remember</i>
<i>why I don't remember so much.</i>

14:03.695 --> 14:06.497
<i>We celebrated in</i>
<i>your hospital room.</i>

14:06.532 --> 14:09.400
<i>Our first night together</i>
<i>as a family.</i>

14:09.434 --> 14:11.736
<i>We didn't know</i>
<i>it would be our last.</i>

14:12.938 --> 14:14.238
Hello?

14:15.541 --> 14:19.076
Abe! They want to book us
on a European tour!

14:19.111 --> 14:20.761
That's fine, doll.
Real fine.

14:20.796 --> 14:22.079
Why, we'll...

14:32.574 --> 14:36.244
You know, Europe's no place
for a six-year-old.

14:36.278 --> 14:40.014
He can handle 110 volt,
but 220 would kill him.

14:40.048 --> 14:43.217
But making music is
my dream, Abe.

14:43.252 --> 14:44.619
<i>Our</i> dream.

14:44.653 --> 14:46.737
I know, Sugar Tomato,

14:46.772 --> 14:49.040
but I'm all the family
this boy's got.

14:49.091 --> 14:51.275
If I don't take care
of him now,

14:51.310 --> 14:53.377
he'll forget the day
he's supposed to come

14:53.412 --> 14:56.614
and see me when I'm old.

15:01.253 --> 15:03.421
Are you okay, Daddy?

15:03.455 --> 15:06.891
Well of course I'm okay!
I'm with you!

15:06.925 --> 15:09.026
Good-bye, Rita.

15:09.061 --> 15:11.863
This is why "life" comes before
"love" in the dictionary.

15:12.965 --> 15:15.132
Aw, thanks, son.

15:15.167 --> 15:18.369
Now to make sure neither
of us ever remember this.

15:25.777 --> 15:28.479
Oh, my God.

15:28.513 --> 15:31.482
I never knew the sacrifices
my father made.

15:31.516 --> 15:33.150
Move over, Fonzie.

15:33.185 --> 15:35.586
I've got a new hero.

15:35.621 --> 15:37.588
I never saw Abe again.

15:37.623 --> 15:39.590
But I thought
you still loved him.

15:39.625 --> 15:41.726
Life isn't all major chords.

15:41.760 --> 15:44.929
Sometimes you gotta hit
the minor keys.

15:44.963 --> 15:46.264
What does that mean?

15:46.298 --> 15:48.432
I got super-addicted
to heroin.

15:50.969 --> 15:53.854
Yeah.

15:53.889 --> 15:55.923
Okay, education paid for,

15:55.958 --> 15:58.125
with a gap year to find myself.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.760
Every nerve
in my body is screaming

15:59.795 --> 16:03.698
"Cash out now," and yet...

16:03.732 --> 16:05.533
I've got a pair of aces!

16:05.567 --> 16:07.835
Ha! Full house!

16:07.869 --> 16:09.604
Aces over threes!

16:09.638 --> 16:12.506
Take that, Rich Texan 001,

16:12.541 --> 16:15.142
and Sideshow Bob @
Springfield Penitentiary-- Hah!

16:15.177 --> 16:16.410
I'm going all in!

16:19.331 --> 16:20.965
Aw, doggone it!

16:21.016 --> 16:22.817
I give up!

16:22.851 --> 16:24.785
It's like Kenny Rogers'
most famous line:

16:24.820 --> 16:27.705
"This is a bad piece
of chicken."

16:31.910 --> 16:33.544
He didn't fold?

16:33.578 --> 16:35.079
But that's insane
unless he has...

16:39.067 --> 16:40.251
Four threes?!

16:40.285 --> 16:41.569
Oh, no!

16:41.603 --> 16:43.487
No-no-no-no-no, no!

16:53.765 --> 16:56.634
I've lost, I've lost everything.

17:00.756 --> 17:02.323
We can all hear you.

17:02.357 --> 17:03.858
Please log off.

17:07.718 --> 17:08.751
Aw, come on, Lise.

17:08.786 --> 17:10.420
No gambling story has
a happy ending

17:10.454 --> 17:11.688
except <i>Seabiscuit.</i>

17:11.722 --> 17:13.256
But you never hear about
the ruined lives

17:13.290 --> 17:14.824
of the people
who bet against him.

17:14.858 --> 17:16.559
Oh, God...

17:16.593 --> 17:18.594
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me!

17:18.628 --> 17:21.196
I was Ivy! Strong Ivy!

17:22.633 --> 17:25.768
Oh, man, this is priceless,
but I can't keep it up.

17:25.803 --> 17:27.971
You've still got a college fund.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.206
What are you talking about?

17:30.240 --> 17:31.674
I'm Sideshow Bob!

17:33.410 --> 17:36.212
I've been using his
avatar to play poker

17:36.246 --> 17:37.647
and trash his favorite
restaurants on Yelp.

17:37.681 --> 17:40.116
And I saved your
vegetarian bacon.

17:40.150 --> 17:41.117
Oh, my God!

17:41.151 --> 17:42.318
<i>You</i> won the pot?

17:42.353 --> 17:44.721
You must have
nearly a million dollars!

17:44.755 --> 17:46.823
I can go to college
and live like a Kennedy!

17:46.857 --> 17:48.791
Listen, after I won,
the website found out

17:48.826 --> 17:50.743
we were both under 18,
so we're back

17:50.778 --> 17:52.795
to the original $5,000.

17:52.830 --> 17:54.630
Shame! Shame!

17:54.665 --> 17:57.083
Did you give the money back
to the people who lost it?

17:57.117 --> 17:58.718
Good-bye.

17:58.752 --> 18:02.088
Well, back to square one
is a major victory

18:02.122 --> 18:04.457
in this house,
but why did you help me?

18:06.327 --> 18:07.894
Come on! Tell me!

18:07.928 --> 18:10.897
Because I actually like you
and felt sorry for you.

18:10.931 --> 18:12.965
What?! You did?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.801
Forget I said anything!

18:14.835 --> 18:18.171
Sure. I have the ending
for my memoir!

18:18.205 --> 18:20.773
I'm sorry I couldn't
help you find your father.

18:20.808 --> 18:24.577
If you find him, tell him
I can still do this.

18:24.611 --> 18:25.945
Yeah.

18:25.979 --> 18:28.114
Holy moley.

18:28.148 --> 18:31.050
And tell him to put on
a splash of this.

18:32.619 --> 18:34.020
That's Dad's cologne?

18:34.054 --> 18:37.123
I always thought it
was his old-man stink.

18:37.157 --> 18:40.760
When I knew him,
it was young-man musk.

18:40.794 --> 18:43.663
Man, you're making <i>me</i> hot
for my Dad.

18:45.466 --> 18:49.001
Only place in town
that still sells Chicory Mist.

18:49.036 --> 18:52.271
After people found out
it's 98% squirrel sweat,

18:52.306 --> 18:53.940
they sorta stopped buying.

18:53.974 --> 18:55.842
Listen, do you
know this man?

18:55.876 --> 18:57.110
Let me ask around.

18:57.144 --> 18:58.978
Abe, you seen this guy?

18:59.012 --> 19:00.580
Oh, I know him.

19:00.614 --> 19:03.049
He's a man who has no son!

19:03.083 --> 19:04.083
Dad!

19:05.252 --> 19:08.221
Abe, we were
so worried!

19:08.255 --> 19:10.523
Dad, promise me
you'll never wander off

19:10.557 --> 19:13.025
and make us explore your
fascinating past again.

19:13.060 --> 19:15.862
I didn't wander off,
ya big fat salami!

19:15.896 --> 19:17.530
I ran away!

19:17.564 --> 19:18.231
What?!

19:18.265 --> 19:19.632
You think I'm boring,

19:19.666 --> 19:21.501
and you never visit me,

19:21.535 --> 19:23.169
and I got sick
of waitin' for ya!

19:23.203 --> 19:26.005
So I got a job and found
a new dump to live in

19:26.039 --> 19:27.640
and I didn't tell you
about it,

19:27.674 --> 19:30.376
so at least that way I know
you're not coming!

19:30.411 --> 19:34.147
Grampa, we will never
miss a visit again.

19:34.181 --> 19:36.149
And there'll be
a lot more of them.

19:36.183 --> 19:38.551
And I don't think
you're boring.

19:38.585 --> 19:41.687
It's just that in today's
multichannel environment,

19:41.722 --> 19:43.356
you have too many
great choices.

19:43.390 --> 19:44.690
Look at Sunday night.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.759
There's, like, eight
amazing shows.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.327
None of them on Fox.

19:48.362 --> 19:52.165
Well... when you put it
that way, all right.

19:52.199 --> 19:56.536
I can't say all is forgiven,
but most is forgotten.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.805
Aw...

20:03.644 --> 20:05.044
I guess my honky-tonkin' days
are over.

20:07.314 --> 20:11.617
What the...?!
Someone's playin' my tune!

20:13.620 --> 20:15.855
Don't take Grampa's meds.

20:15.889 --> 20:17.723
I'm payin' for 'em.

20:24.948 --> 20:26.082
Hey, Abe.

20:26.116 --> 20:28.067
Good to see you again.

20:28.101 --> 20:29.469
Rita!

20:29.503 --> 20:31.387
You look dynamite!

20:31.421 --> 20:33.806
And you look like you could
use a good ironing,

20:33.841 --> 20:35.208
but I still love you.

20:35.242 --> 20:37.176
Take a seat. Yeah.

20:40.247 --> 20:43.649
♪ My heart does the two-step
when you waltz in the place ♪

20:43.684 --> 20:47.453
♪ Yeah, my ticker beats quicker
when I look at your face ♪

20:47.488 --> 20:52.124
♪ Yeah, you'd better call

20:52.159 --> 20:55.282
Yeah...

die in the wild.
