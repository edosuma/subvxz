04:56.367 --> 04:58.700
LOSE MY NUMBER, BECAUSE I'M

04:58.700 --> 05:01.433

YOU LET YOUR EMOTIONS RULE YOU.

05:35.733 --> 05:36.667
I'M A BIG GIRL.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.367
I KNEW WHAT I GOT MYSELF INTO

05:38.367 --> 05:39.467
WHEN I SLEPT WITH MALCOLM.

05:39.467 --> 05:42.933
WE MADE NO PROMISES.

05:56.633 --> 05:58.900
SHE OWES ME MORE THAN 10 Gs.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.333
>> I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE

06:00.333 --> 06:01.900
CONCEPT OF A TAB.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.167
IF YOU TAKE THE MERCHANDISE, YOU

06:03.167 --> 06:04.100
SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE

06:04.100 --> 06:04.933
MERCHANDISE.

06:10.067 --> 06:11.900
HER ASSETS WERE FROZEN.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.067
>> THEN SHE SHOULD STOP SHOPPING

06:13.067 --> 06:14.667
UNTIL THEY THAW OUT.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.300
>> OH, THEY'VE THAWED.

06:34.233 --> 06:35.633
>> I'VE JUST NEVER SEEN YOU WITH

06:35.633 --> 06:36.567
A BOOK.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.500

12:56.167 --> 12:57.300
>> OH.

12:57.300 --> 12:58.200
[laughs]

12:58.200 --> 12:59.433
>> LOOK, I'M GONNA DO A KICK-ASS

12:59.433 --> 13:00.367
JOB.

13:00.367 --> 13:03.200
I'M A HARD WORKER, I LEARN FAST,

13:03.200 --> 13:05.167
AND I HAVE REALLY GOOD TASTE.

13:05.167 --> 13:07.567
CLEARLY.

13:07.567 --> 13:09.067
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING

13:09.067 --> 13:09.833
IN.

13:09.833 --> 13:10.800
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

13:10.800 --> 13:11.733
>> HEY, VAL, I WANT YOU TO MEET

13:11.733 --> 13:13.700
MY NEW ARTIST, MAC MILLER.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.067
THIS DUDE IS GONNA BE THE

13:15.067 --> 13:16.100
BIGGEST THING OUT THERE.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.267
>> WHOA, BACK UP.

13:17.267 --> 13:19.233
YOU GOT YOUR PROMOTION TO A&R?

13:19.233 --> 13:22.367
>> NOT YET, BUT WHEN MAC IS

13:22.367 --> 13:23.567
INTRODUCED TO MY BOSS, THERE'S

13:23.567 --> 13:25.067
NO WAY I WON'T.

13:31.767 --> 13:32.900

13:35.367 --> 13:37.200
I WAS JUST INTERVIEWING INTERNS.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.267
SHE WAS JUST LEAVING.

13:38.267 --> 13:38.967
>> HOW ABOUT THIS?

13:38.967 --> 13:40.167
IF YOU'RE NOT THOROUGHLY

13:40.167 --> 13:42.067
IMPRESSED, THEN I'LL GET OUT OF

13:42.067 --> 13:42.933
YOUR HAIR.

13:42.933 --> 13:45.100
PROMISE.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.800
>> VAL, SHE'S BOLD, BRAZEN,

13:47.800 --> 13:49.600
OVERLY-CONFIDENT, BUT THERE'S

13:49.600 --> 13:50.267
SOMETHING ABOUT HER.

13:50.267 --> 13:51.067
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GIVE HER A

13:51.067 --> 13:52.767
CHANCE?

13:52.767 --> 13:56.767
>> PLEASE?

13:56.767 --> 13:59.333
>> YOU HAVE ONE SHOT.

13:59.333 --> 14:00.567
GO.

14:00.567 --> 14:02.267

14:19.467 --> 14:20.967
BORROW A PURSE TO GO TO A PARTY

14:20.967 --> 14:22.533

14:23.800 --> 14:25.833
MILLIONAIRES OF ATLANTA, SO

14:25.833 --> 14:26.800

14:27.967 --> 14:28.900

14:28.900 --> 14:30.133

14:30.133 --> 14:31.567
CUTIES THERE.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.500
UM, WHAT'S UP WITH YOU AND MR.

14:33.500 --> 14:34.467

14:34.467 --> 14:38.267

14:38.267 --> 14:41.133
IT MIGHT BE COLD.

14:41.133 --> 14:42.667
I'MA WEAR THIS.

14:42.667 --> 14:45.133

15:12.233 --> 15:12.967
>> I REALLY NEED YOU TO DO THIS

15:12.967 --> 15:13.733

15:13.733 --> 15:15.133
JUST TRUST ME.

15:15.133 --> 15:19.933
PLEASE, TAKE 'EM OFF.

15:19.933 --> 15:22.100
DUDE, YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING I

15:22.100 --> 15:26.667
HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE.

15:26.667 --> 15:27.700
>> THAT'S WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR

15:27.700 --> 15:28.600
TOO.

15:28.600 --> 15:29.300
>> [laughs]

[overlapping chatter]

16:13.367 --> 16:15.067
[laughter]

16:15.067 --> 16:16.900
>> SO, BLAKE, HOW DID YOU GET

16:16.900 --> 16:17.700
INTERESTED IN COOKING?

16:17.700 --> 16:18.700
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S A REALLY FUNNY

16:18.700 --> 16:19.667
STORY.

16:19.667 --> 16:21.067
MY PARENTS AND BLAKE'S PARENTS

16:21.067 --> 16:22.633
WERE, UM--WAIT, NO, NO, NO.

16:22.633 --> 16:23.367
THAT'S NOT IT.

16:23.367 --> 16:24.400
WAIT, WHAT WAS IT?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.967
WHAT WAS IT?

16:26.967 --> 16:28.100
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:28.100 --> 16:30.067
BLAKE TELLS IT SO MUCH BETTER

16:30.067 --> 16:33.267
THAN I DO, SO I'M GONNA GO--

16:33.267 --> 16:34.167
>> CATCH A MOVIE?

16:34.167 --> 16:34.833
>> YES.

16:34.833 --> 16:35.500
>> GREAT IDEA.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.167
>> OKAY.

16:36.167 --> 16:36.833
>> OKAY. BYE NOW.

16:36.833 --> 16:37.500
>> BYE.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.167
>> BYE.

16:38.167 --> 16:38.833
>> BYE.

16:38.833 --> 16:40.900
>> [laughs] OKAY, BYE.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.767
WELL, ACTUALLY, FROM A YOUNG

16:42.767 --> 16:44.067
AGE, I WAS SO FINICKY, I

16:44.067 --> 16:45.233
WOULDN'T EVEN EAT FISH STICKS.

16:45.233 --> 16:48.067
I WANTED BAKED CRAB AND STUFFED

16:48.067 --> 16:48.800
TROUT.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.900
[laughs]

16:50.900 --> 16:52.467
I WAS A BOUGIE LITTLE KID.

16:52.467 --> 16:53.500
>> OH.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.533
>> OH, NO, NO, NO.

16:55.533 --> 16:56.300
>> WHAT?

16:56.300 --> 16:57.100
>> LOOSEN YOUR GRIP.

16:57.100 --> 16:57.833
HERE.

16:57.833 --> 16:58.500
>> OH.

16:58.500 --> 16:59.167
>> YEAH.

16:59.167 --> 16:59.833
>> OKAY.

16:59.833 --> 17:00.833
>> HAVE FUN WITH IT.

17:00.833 --> 17:02.433
MM-HMM.

17:02.433 --> 17:03.233
>> LIKE THAT?

17:03.233 --> 17:04.067
>> MM-HMM.

17:04.067 --> 17:04.900
>> OKAY.

17:04.900 --> 17:07.767
>> MUCH BETTER.

17:07.767 --> 17:10.133
AND THEN I STUDIED AT LE CORDON

17:10.133 --> 17:12.067
BLEU IN PARIS AND LATER AT THE

17:12.067 --> 17:13.533
ITALIAN CULINARY ACADEMY IN

17:13.533 --> 17:14.367
ITALY.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.067
>> HMM.

17:15.067 --> 17:16.167
>> HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO ITALY?

17:16.167 --> 17:17.600
>> OH, I LOVE ITALY.

17:17.600 --> 17:18.867
MILAN IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE

17:18.867 --> 17:19.933
CITIES IN THE WORLD.

17:19.933 --> 17:26.067
>> TRY THIS.

17:26.067 --> 17:27.200
>> MMM!

17:27.200 --> 17:29.067
OH, MY GOD.

17:29.067 --> 17:30.367
YOU ALMOST LOST A FINGER ON

17:30.367 --> 17:31.400
THAT, THAT'S SO GOOD.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.067
>> [laughs]

17:32.067 --> 17:33.800
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I COOK.

17:33.800 --> 17:34.833
I LOVE THE LOOK ON SOMEONE'S

17:34.833 --> 17:36.467
FACE WHEN THEY TAKE A BITE OF

17:36.467 --> 17:37.767
SOMETHING I'VE MADE AND THEY'RE

17:37.767 --> 17:38.433
IN HEAVEN.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.367
>> MMM!

17:39.367 --> 17:41.367
>> I KNOW I DID THAT.

17:44.233 --> 17:45.967
>> * YOU SEE ME ROLLING UP *

17:45.967 --> 17:47.467
* IN MY MERCEDES *

17:47.467 --> 17:49.267
* BEEN HANGING DOWN MY WAY *

17:49.267 --> 17:50.867
* MUCH MORE THAN LATELY *

17:50.867 --> 17:51.800
* I KNOW THE SCENE *

17:51.800 --> 17:53.767
>> LOOK OVER THERE, 12:00.

17:53.767 --> 17:55.400
ALL THAT FINENESS.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.333
WHOO!

17:56.333 --> 17:57.967
WHAT I WOULD DO.

17:57.967 --> 17:59.800
>> I CAN'T LOOK RIGHT NOW.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.333
MY CLOCK STOPPED AT 9:00 AND MY

18:01.333 --> 18:02.467
ALARM IS GOING OFF.

18:02.467 --> 18:05.133
>> UM, I THINK YOU MIGHT FIND

18:05.133 --> 18:11.633
3:00 INTERESTING TOO.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.633
>> NOT AT ALL.

18:13.633 --> 18:15.067
BUT BACK TO YOU AND THIS

18:15.067 --> 18:16.600
CELIBACY KICK YOU'RE ON.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.933
THE ONLY THING YOU WOULD DO WITH

18:17.933 --> 18:19.333
ALL THAT FINENESS IS GET BOTH

18:19.333 --> 18:21.767
OF YOU ALL HOT AND BOTHERED.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.500
>> CELIBACY IS A SPIRITUAL

18:23.500 --> 18:24.367
JOURNEY.

18:24.367 --> 18:26.267
YOU SHOULD TRY IT SOMETIME.

18:26.267 --> 18:27.933
>> IT'S A TORTUROUS JOURNEY, AND

18:27.933 --> 18:29.467
I DON'T LIKE TO TRAVEL ALONE.

18:29.467 --> 18:30.367
[laughs]

18:30.367 --> 18:32.233
>> HI, I'M ALEX.

18:32.233 --> 18:33.967
I DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS, I DON'T

18:33.967 --> 18:35.300
EAT ANY PORK, I DON'T SMOKE, I

18:35.300 --> 18:36.300
DON'T DRINK, I'M FINANCIALLY

18:36.300 --> 18:38.167
STABLE, AND I'M FIT, AND MOST OF

18:38.167 --> 18:41.500
ALL, I'M PACKING.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.533
I THINK THAT MEETS ALL YOUR

18:42.533 --> 18:43.400
REQUIREMENTS.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.067
CAN WE TALK?

18:44.067 --> 18:44.867
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE YOU

18:44.867 --> 18:46.533
THINK THAT YOU COULD APPROACH ME

18:46.533 --> 18:47.300
WITH THAT.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.367
>> BUT YOU SAID YOU LIKE TO--

18:48.367 --> 18:49.667
>> I KNOW I SAID IT ON MY SHOW,

18:49.667 --> 18:52.667
BUT DAMN, DUDE, HAVE SOME GAME.

18:52.667 --> 18:53.967
IS--IS IT ME?

18:53.967 --> 18:54.700
>> [laughs]

18:54.700 --> 18:55.433
>> NO, SERIOUSLY, I JUST NEED TO

18:55.433 --> 18:56.200
KNOW.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.400
I MEAN, AM I GIVING OFF

18:57.400 --> 18:58.267
SOMETHING?

18:58.267 --> 19:00.433
>> [laughs]

19:05.667 --> 19:07.267
>> I HOPE I'M NOT BEING TOO

19:07.267 --> 19:09.667
FORWARD, BUT I WOULD LOVE TO GET

19:09.667 --> 19:11.067
YOU A DRINK.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.167
>> WELL, MY MOTHER TOLD ME TO

19:13.167 --> 19:14.600
NEVER ACCEPT A DRINK FROM A

19:14.600 --> 19:16.933
STRANGER, SO YOU CAN START BY

19:16.933 --> 19:18.167
TELLING ME YOUR NAME.

19:18.167 --> 19:20.667
>> IT'S WINSTON.

19:20.667 --> 19:22.233
AND YOU ARE?

19:22.233 --> 19:23.233
>> KEISHA.

19:23.233 --> 19:28.333
AND I'D LOVE A VODKA CRANBERRY.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.767
>> CAN I GET A SCOTCH AND SODA

19:29.767 --> 19:31.867
AND A CRANBERRY AND VODKA FOR

19:31.867 --> 19:34.333
THE LADY?

19:34.333 --> 19:37.233
SO TELL ME, DO YOU HAVE

19:37.233 --> 19:38.267
ANYONE SPECIAL IN YOUR LIFE

19:38.267 --> 19:39.200
RIGHT NOW?

19:39.200 --> 19:40.433
UH, I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE

19:40.433 --> 19:41.433
DISRESPECTFUL.

19:41.433 --> 19:43.967
>> I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THERE

19:43.967 --> 19:45.700
IS ABSOLUTELY NO ONE SPECIAL IN

19:45.700 --> 19:46.800
MY LIFE.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.133
>> DAMN.

19:48.133 --> 19:49.300
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD FEEL

19:49.300 --> 19:51.067
HAPPY FOR ME OR SORRY FOR YOU,

19:51.067 --> 19:52.600
BUT I DO FEEL LUCKY.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.467
>> WHY IS THAT?

19:53.467 --> 19:54.433
>> BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WATCHING

19:54.433 --> 19:55.400
GUYS STRIKE OUT WITH YOU ALL

19:55.400 --> 19:56.867
NIGHT.

19:56.867 --> 19:58.100
BUT FOR SOME REASON, YOU HAVEN'T

19:58.100 --> 19:59.833
SENT ME AWAY.

19:59.833 --> 20:01.367
>> YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN ME A REASON

20:01.367 --> 20:02.400
TO YET.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.000
>> AND I DON'T PLAN ON IT.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.167
>> I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN A

20:06.167 --> 20:07.733
WOMAN CAPTURE YOUR ATTENTION

20:07.733 --> 20:09.200
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.667
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,

20:10.667 --> 20:11.500
POP?

20:11.500 --> 20:12.733
>> OH, COME ON, SON.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.500
I KNOW YOU, BOY.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.100
YOU'VE BEEN STARING OVER THERE

20:16.100 --> 20:17.800
AT THAT WOMAN ALL NIGHT LONG,

20:17.800 --> 20:18.800
AND YOU'RE DRINKING MORE THAN

20:18.800 --> 20:19.667
USUAL.

20:19.667 --> 20:20.733
NOW, WHO IS SHE?

20:20.733 --> 20:22.567
>> KEISHA GREENE.

20:22.567 --> 20:24.167
SOMEONE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO STOP

20:24.167 --> 20:24.933
THINKING ABOUT.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.300
>> AH, BUT IT'S NOT WORKING, I

20:26.300 --> 20:27.633
SEE.

20:27.633 --> 20:30.067
>> THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT

20:30.067 --> 20:30.900
HER.

20:30.900 --> 20:31.967
>> MAYBE YOU NEED TO EXPLORE

20:31.967 --> 20:33.267
WHAT THAT SOMETHING IS INSTEAD

20:33.267 --> 20:34.000
OF RUNNING.

20:34.000 --> 20:34.667
>> I DON'T KNOW.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.800
I LIKE MY FREEDOM, YOU KNOW?

20:36.800 --> 20:38.333
PLUS, THERE ARE STILL SOME

20:38.333 --> 20:39.600
QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE ABOUT HER

20:39.600 --> 20:40.500
THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ANSWERED.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.667
>> LOOK, I KNOW HOW IT IS,

20:41.667 --> 20:43.333
RUNNING WITH THIS ONE AND THAT

20:43.333 --> 20:44.033
ONE.

20:44.033 --> 20:46.033
BUT AFTER A WHILE, IT GOT OLD.

20:46.033 --> 20:47.867
THEN I MET YOU MA AND I MESSED

20:47.867 --> 20:49.833
THAT UP 'CAUSE OF HOW I LIKED MY

20:49.833 --> 20:50.567
FREEDOM.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.100
>> I GOT THIS, POPS, OKAY?

20:52.100 --> 20:53.933
I'M COOL.

20:53.933 --> 20:55.333
>> READY, GIRL?

20:55.333 --> 20:57.400
LOOK, I KNOW EVERYONE'S GOT TO

20:57.400 --> 20:59.500
MAKE THEIR OWN MISTAKES, AND

20:59.500 --> 21:02.433
YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT.

21:02.433 --> 21:04.667
I'LL CHECK YOU LATER.

21:09.800 --> 21:10.933
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO HELP ME.

21:10.933 --> 21:12.167
YOU COOKED EVERYTHING.

21:12.167 --> 21:13.633
THE LEAST I CAN DO IS CLEAN.

21:13.633 --> 21:15.700
>> I DON'T MIND DOING DISHES.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.300
PLUS, IT'S AN EXCUSE TO SPEND A

21:17.300 --> 21:18.633
LITTLE MORE TIME WITH YOU.

21:18.633 --> 21:20.867
>> [laughs] OKAY, GOOD.

21:20.867 --> 21:23.333
HOW ABOUT I WASH, YOU DRY?

21:23.333 --> 21:27.067
>> UH, I'D RATHER HELP YOU WASH.

21:27.067 --> 21:30.900
I MEAN, THERE ARE A LOT OF DIRTY

21:30.900 --> 21:32.767
DISHES.

21:32.767 --> 21:37.067
>> UH, I LIKE THAT IDEA.

21:37.067 --> 21:39.933
SO TELL ME, HOW DOES A MAN WHO'S

21:39.933 --> 21:42.367
HANDSOME, TALENTED, AND

21:42.367 --> 21:45.500
WELL-TRAVELED STAY SINGLE?

21:45.500 --> 21:48.067
>> WELL, I HAVEN'T MET THE RIGHT

21:48.067 --> 21:50.167
WOMAN YET.

22:14.067 --> 22:15.567
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT.

22:15.567 --> 22:16.533
>> OH.

22:16.533 --> 22:17.533
>> I RAN INTO A COLLEAGUE ON THE

22:17.533 --> 22:18.867
WAY BACK FROM THE BATHROOM.

22:18.867 --> 22:20.567
>> OH, NO PROBLEM.

22:20.567 --> 22:22.233
YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT

22:22.233 --> 22:25.133
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS?

22:25.133 --> 22:26.300
>> YEAH.

22:26.300 --> 22:27.967
>> WHAT IS THAT EXACTLY?

22:27.967 --> 22:29.600
>> WELL, BASICALLY, MY JOB IS TO

22:29.600 --> 22:31.067
ASSESS THE TRUE VALUE OF A

22:31.067 --> 22:32.467
COMPANY IN ORDER TO DETERMINE

22:32.467 --> 22:34.100
WHETHER IT'S WORTH TAKING OVER.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.067
>> HMM.

22:35.067 --> 22:36.733
THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING I'D

22:36.733 --> 22:37.700
BE GOOD AT.

22:37.700 --> 22:38.800
>> REALLY?

22:38.800 --> 22:39.733
>> ABSOLUTELY.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.833
ASSESSING AND TAKING OVER, I'M

22:41.833 --> 22:43.633
DOING THAT RIGHT NOW.

22:43.633 --> 22:45.533
[both laugh]

22:45.533 --> 22:46.667
>> YOU'RE FUNNY.

22:46.667 --> 22:47.700
I'VE NEVER HAD A LADY SAY THAT

22:47.700 --> 22:49.100
TO ME.

22:49.100 --> 22:51.233
I LIKE YOU.

22:51.233 --> 22:52.700
I'M JUST WONDERING IF THE

22:52.700 --> 22:54.500
FEELING IS MUTUAL.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.800
>> STILL ASSESSING.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.367
>> I'LL HAVE A MADRAS, PLEASE.

22:58.367 --> 23:00.133
>> OH, PLEASE, SIT.

23:00.133 --> 23:00.800
I'LL STAND.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.200
>> THANK YOU.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.700
>> HOW REFRESHING.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.233
A REAL GENTLEMAN.

23:05.233 --> 23:07.700
>> THERE ARE A FEW OF US LEFT.

23:07.700 --> 23:09.167
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU'D LIKE TO

23:09.167 --> 23:10.500
SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME WITH ME

23:10.500 --> 23:11.467
LATER ON THIS EVENING?

23:11.467 --> 23:12.833
>> AFTER THIS PARTY IS OVER, I'M

23:12.833 --> 23:15.300
GOING HOME TO TAKE A LONG, HOT

23:15.300 --> 23:16.567
BUBBLE BATH.

23:16.567 --> 23:18.067
>> WHY DON'T WE TAKE THAT LONG,

23:18.067 --> 23:20.300
HOT BUBBLE BATH TOGETHER?

23:20.300 --> 23:22.667
>> WHOA, SLOW DOWN.

23:22.667 --> 23:25.333
YOU DON'T KNOW ME LIKE THAT.

23:25.333 --> 23:27.767
>> I'LL GIVE YOU $10,000.

23:27.767 --> 23:29.900
>> WHY WOULD YOU GIVE ME $10--

23:29.900 --> 23:32.933
WAIT, YOU THINK I'M A--?

23:32.933 --> 23:34.200
OH, HELL NO.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.067
>> KEISHA, I'M A WEALTHY MAN

23:36.067 --> 23:36.700
ACCUSTOMED TO GETTING WHAT I

23:36.700 --> 23:38.567
WANT, AND I DON'T MIND PAYING

23:38.567 --> 23:39.300
FOR IT.

23:39.300 --> 23:46.267
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE FLATTERED.

23:46.267 --> 23:50.900
HERE'S A DOWN PAYMENT.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.167
THINK ABOUT IT.

23:52.167 --> 23:53.333
I'LL BE AT THE EMPIRE FOR A

23:53.333 --> 23:55.267
COUPLE OF NIGHTS.

24:08.467 --> 24:09.167
>> * I MET THIS GIRL *

24:09.167 --> 24:10.867
* NAMED RADIO *

24:10.867 --> 24:14.100
* SAID HER SIGNAL WAS LOW *

24:14.100 --> 24:15.100
* SHE WASN'T GETTING *

24:15.100 --> 24:17.300
* MY SOUND *

24:17.300 --> 24:20.567
* SHE KEPT THE VOLUME DOWN *

24:20.567 --> 24:21.267
* I TOLD HER *

24:21.267 --> 24:22.433
* TURN UP THE BASS *

24:22.433 --> 24:23.667
* BASS *

24:23.667 --> 24:24.633
* AND THEN SHE KISSED ME *

24:24.633 --> 24:26.900
* IN MY FACE, FACE, FACE *

24:26.900 --> 24:30.267
* I TOLD HER I HAD A GIRL *

24:30.267 --> 24:33.500
* THAT MEANT THE WORLD TO ME *

24:33.500 --> 24:34.433
* SHE JUST LOOKED ME *

24:34.433 --> 24:35.100
* UP AND DOWN *

24:35.100 --> 24:36.233
>> EXCUSE ME, MISS.

24:36.233 --> 24:37.867
LOOK, I'M NEW, SO I DON'T REALLY

24:37.867 --> 24:39.733
KNOW ALL THE RULES, BUT I'M

24:39.733 --> 24:41.167
PRETTY SURE IF YOU'RE JUST GONNA

24:41.167 --> 24:42.133
SIT HERE ALL DAY, YOU'RE GONNA

24:42.133 --> 24:44.467
HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING.

24:44.467 --> 24:45.867
>> WHO THE HELL IS SHE?

24:45.867 --> 24:48.600
>> OH, THIS IS MY NEW INTERN

24:48.600 --> 24:49.533
CHRISTINA.

24:49.533 --> 24:50.633
CHRISTINA, THIS IS KEISHA, MY

24:50.633 --> 24:51.467
BEST FRIEND.

24:51.467 --> 24:52.567
SHE'S BEEN HELPING OUT HERE

24:52.567 --> 24:53.567
EVERY DAY AS A FAVOR.

24:53.567 --> 24:54.600
>> BUT SINCE SHE'S NEVER DONE

24:54.600 --> 24:56.300
MUCH MORE THAN THIS, VAL HAD TO

24:56.300 --> 24:57.567
BITE THE BULLET AND PAY SOMEONE.

24:57.567 --> 24:59.400
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.667
>> I'M GLAD YOU GUYS GOT IT

25:00.667 --> 25:01.833
WORKED OUT.

25:01.833 --> 25:02.967
>> WELL, IT WAS NICE TO MEET

25:02.967 --> 25:03.767
YOU, KEISHA.

25:03.767 --> 25:04.667
>> I'LL MAKE SURE I KEEP ALL THE

25:04.667 --> 25:08.300
CUSTOMERS OFF THE COUCH FOR YOU.

25:08.300 --> 25:10.133
>> I LIKE THIS GIRL.

25:10.133 --> 25:12.533
SHE'S GOT POTENTIAL.

25:12.533 --> 25:15.333
SO VAL, I DIDN'T HEAR ANY

25:15.333 --> 25:16.700
SCREAMS OF PASSION COMING FROM

25:16.700 --> 25:18.067
YOUR ROOM LAST NIGHT.

25:18.067 --> 25:20.367
>> NO, BUT I DID HAVE TO CALL

25:20.367 --> 25:21.500
APRIL THIS MORNING AND THANK HER

25:21.500 --> 25:22.900
FOR INTRODUCING ME TO BLAKE.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.400
I MEAN, IT WAS THE PERFECT

25:24.400 --> 25:25.400
EVENING.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.500
HE'S FUNNY, SEXY, AND HE CAN

25:27.500 --> 25:28.867
COOK HIS ASS OFF.

25:28.867 --> 25:30.067
>> HUH.

25:30.067 --> 25:31.533
DID YOU KISS HIM?

25:31.533 --> 25:32.467
>> WE KISSED ALL OVER THE

25:32.467 --> 25:34.067
KITCHEN, ALL OVER THE LIVING

25:34.067 --> 25:35.600
ROOM, AT THE FRONT DOOR THE

25:35.600 --> 25:36.433
WHOLE TIME WE WERE SAYING

25:36.433 --> 25:37.300
GOOD-BYE.

25:37.300 --> 25:39.167
>> IF YOU WERE A GUY, THAT STORY

25:39.167 --> 25:43.567
WOULD BE SO HOT.

25:43.567 --> 25:45.233
>> SO VAL, IF IT WAS THAT GOOD,

25:45.233 --> 25:46.533
WHY DO YOU LOOK SO SAD?

25:46.533 --> 25:48.567
>> BECAUSE I LIKE HIM.

25:48.567 --> 25:49.900
HE DOESN'T LIVE HERE, SO WE'RE

25:49.900 --> 25:51.400
NOT BUILDING TO ANYTHING.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.333
WHAT I WANT IS SO CLOSE YET SO

25:53.333 --> 25:56.533
FAR AWAY.

25:56.533 --> 25:57.633
>> THANKS FOR SPOILING A

25:57.633 --> 25:59.067
SEMI-HOT STORY.

25:59.067 --> 26:00.433
SO, HOW WAS THAT PARTY I WASN'T

26:00.433 --> 26:01.433
INVITED TO?

26:01.433 --> 26:02.233
>> IT WAS COOL.

26:02.233 --> 26:03.900
I MET A VERY SWEET, WEALTHY MAN

26:03.900 --> 26:05.367
WHO WINED AND DINED ME ALL NIGHT

26:05.367 --> 26:07.900
LONG AND THEN OFFERED ME $10,000

26:07.900 --> 26:08.900
TO SLEEP WITH HIM.

26:08.900 --> 26:09.867
>> WHAT?

26:09.867 --> 26:11.133
WHAT AN ASS.

26:11.133 --> 26:12.100
>> FORGET THAT.

26:12.100 --> 26:12.900
HOW WAS THE SEX?

26:12.900 --> 26:13.733
>> I WOULDN'T KNOW.

26:13.733 --> 26:14.667
I DIDN'T DO IT.

26:14.667 --> 26:16.100
BUT HE TOLD ME TO KEEP THE MONEY

26:16.100 --> 26:17.800
WHILE I THINK ABOUT IT, SO I'M

26:17.800 --> 26:18.600
THINKING ABOUT HOW I'M GONNA

26:18.600 --> 26:19.700
SPEND IT.

26:19.700 --> 26:20.200
JERK.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.233
>> I CANNOT BELIEVE HE THOUGHT

26:21.233 --> 26:22.067
HE COULD BUY YOU.

26:22.067 --> 26:22.967
IDIOT.

26:22.967 --> 26:25.533
>> WHY IS HE AN IDIOT?

26:25.533 --> 26:26.967
WOMEN TRADE SEX FOR STUFF ALL

26:26.967 --> 26:27.633
THE TIME.

26:27.633 --> 26:30.333
>> EXCUSE ME?

26:30.333 --> 26:31.667
>> WOMEN ALWAYS WANT GUYS TO

26:31.667 --> 26:32.533
SPEND MONEY ON THEM, AND

26:32.533 --> 26:34.167
YOU'LL GLADLY ACCEPT KNOWING

26:34.167 --> 26:36.133
THAT SEX IS HIS AGENDA, BUT IF

26:36.133 --> 26:37.067
HE JUST WANTS TO GIVE YOU THE

26:37.067 --> 26:37.833
MONEY UP FRONT, YOU GET

26:37.833 --> 26:38.567
OFFENDED?

26:38.567 --> 26:39.433
>> RIGHT, BECAUSE THAT'S

26:39.433 --> 26:41.300
PROSTITUTION, NOT DATING.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.500
>> I DON'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.133
>> OMAR, THERE IS A HUGE

26:44.133 --> 26:44.800
DIFFERENCE.

26:44.800 --> 26:45.467
>> WHY?

26:45.467 --> 26:46.300
YOU SAID HE WAS HANDSOME AND

26:46.300 --> 26:47.600
CHARMING AND EVERYTHING WAS GOOD

26:47.600 --> 26:48.533
UNTIL HE OFFERED YOU THE MONEY.

26:48.533 --> 26:49.200
>> MM-HMM.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.233
>> BUT IF HE WERE TO TAKE YOU

26:50.233 --> 26:51.200
OUT ON THREE OR FOUR DATES,

26:51.200 --> 26:53.167
SPEND THE SAME $10,000, HE'D BE

26:53.167 --> 26:54.433
THE MAN OF YOUR DREAMS, NOT A

26:54.433 --> 26:55.633
JERK.

26:55.633 --> 26:57.267
>> THE DIFFERENCE IS, WHEN YOU

26:57.267 --> 26:58.733
DATE A GUY, IF YOU GIVE IT UP TO

26:58.733 --> 27:00.867
HIM, IT'S ON YOUR TERMS.

27:00.867 --> 27:02.067
IF THEY WANT TO SPEND MONEY IN

27:02.067 --> 27:03.833
THE HOPES OF GETTING IT, PFFT,

27:03.833 --> 27:04.600
THAT'S ON THEM.

27:04.600 --> 27:05.567
>> THAT'S TRUE, KEISHA, BUT COME

27:05.567 --> 27:06.233
ON.

27:06.233 --> 27:07.067
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN

27:07.067 --> 27:08.400
ACCEPT BEFORE HE EXPECTS

27:08.400 --> 27:09.533
SOMETHING IN RETURN.

27:09.533 --> 27:10.800
>> AND YOU DID KEEP THE MONEY,

27:10.800 --> 27:11.633
KEISHA.

27:11.633 --> 27:13.600
>> I KEPT THE MONEY TO TEACH HIM

27:13.600 --> 27:14.467
A LESSON.

27:14.467 --> 27:15.800
>> HOW IS HE LEARNING A LESSON?

27:15.800 --> 27:17.233
HE PROBABLY THINKS YOU'RE

27:17.233 --> 27:18.667
GETTING WAXED FOR HIM RIGHT NOW.

27:18.667 --> 27:19.667
>> WHERE DID YOU SUDDENLY GET

27:19.667 --> 27:21.167
ALL THIS TESTOSTERONE FROM?

27:21.167 --> 27:25.067
GO ACCESSORIZE SOMEBODY.

27:25.067 --> 27:26.167
>> HERE COMES THE DIVORCED RICH

27:26.167 --> 27:27.067
BITCH.

27:27.067 --> 27:30.133
HEY, BEAUTIFUL.

27:30.133 --> 27:31.067
>> HEY, VAL.

27:31.067 --> 27:31.833
>> HI.

27:31.833 --> 27:32.733
>> I HAVE A SHIRT ON HOLD THAT I

27:32.733 --> 27:34.100
NEED TO PICK UP TODAY.

27:34.100 --> 27:37.733
>> I'LL GET IT.

27:37.733 --> 27:39.400
THIS IS GONNA LOOK SO GOOD ON

27:39.400 --> 27:40.067
YOU.

27:40.067 --> 27:40.733
>> I KNOW.

27:40.733 --> 27:41.900
I LOVE IT SO MUCH, I HAD TO HAVE

27:41.900 --> 27:43.467
IT IN EVERY COLOR.

27:43.467 --> 27:46.167
>> OKAY, THAT'S $584.34.

27:46.167 --> 27:47.133
>> JUST PUT IT ON MY TAB, WILL

27:47.133 --> 27:47.833
YOU?

27:47.833 --> 27:48.733
>> WELL, UH, WAIT, GRETCHEN.

27:48.733 --> 27:50.100
ACTUALLY, MY POLICY IS TO SETTLE

27:50.100 --> 27:51.267
AT THE END OF EVERY MONTH, AND

27:51.267 --> 27:53.100
IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS, SO I'D

27:53.100 --> 27:54.500
APPRECIATE IT IF YOU--

27:54.500 --> 27:55.167
>> NEXT TIME, BABE.

27:55.167 --> 27:56.067
I'M SUPER LATE FOR AN

27:56.067 --> 27:56.933
APPOINTMENT.

27:56.933 --> 28:01.833
>> OKAY.

28:01.833 --> 28:02.833
>> "SUPER LATE FOR AN

28:02.833 --> 28:04.067
APPOINTMENT."

28:04.067 --> 28:05.833
SHE'S SUPER PLAYING YOU, VAL.

28:05.833 --> 28:07.233
ONE IN EVERY COLOR.

28:07.233 --> 28:08.533
SHE'S A TRIP.

28:08.533 --> 28:09.900
>> IT'S OKAY.

28:09.900 --> 28:11.333
I'M SURE SHE'LL PAY THE NEXT

28:11.333 --> 28:12.533
TIME SHE COMES IN.

28:12.533 --> 28:13.800
>> IF I'M HERE, SHE DEFINITELY

28:13.800 --> 28:16.433
WILL.

28:16.433 --> 28:17.733
>> * WHOO-WHEE *

28:17.733 --> 28:19.200
* BACK IN 1984 *

28:19.200 --> 28:21.067
* A CHILD CAME LOW AND ALONE *

28:21.067 --> 28:22.267
* LO AND BEHOLD, I WAS FRESH *

28:22.267 --> 28:24.933
>> UH, YEAH. YEAH.

28:24.933 --> 28:27.133
I--YEAH.

28:27.133 --> 28:29.667
I FINALLY--I FINALLY WATCHED THE

28:29.667 --> 28:33.267
VIDEO AND, UH, I HEAR THAT YOU

28:33.267 --> 28:34.667
LOVE IT.

28:34.667 --> 28:37.400
YEAH, THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE

28:37.400 --> 28:38.867
I HATE IT.

28:38.867 --> 28:40.767
DANTE HANDLES IT FROM HERE.

28:40.767 --> 28:43.267
YOU ANSWER TO HIM NOW, OKAY?

28:43.267 --> 28:44.967
I MEAN, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS

28:44.967 --> 28:45.633
KID?

28:45.633 --> 28:47.600
AFTER HE'S SPENT 300 GRAND ON A

28:47.600 --> 28:50.667
VIDEO THAT NO ONE WILL EVER SEE.

28:50.667 --> 28:52.867
JOSEPH KAHN WOULD HAVE KILLED

28:52.867 --> 28:53.600
THIS VIDEO.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.200
APRIL, GET KAHN ON THE PHONE.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.067
>> WES, HEY, I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY,

28:57.067 --> 28:58.567
BUT BEFORE I DO THAT, CAN I JUST

28:58.567 --> 28:59.467
SAY SOMETHING?

28:59.467 --> 29:01.133
I FOUND A RAPPER.

29:01.133 --> 29:03.067
THIS KID IS LIKE A BABY BEASTIE

29:03.067 --> 29:03.767
BOY.

29:03.767 --> 29:05.067
HE'S GOT THIS EVERYDAY APPEAL

29:05.067 --> 29:06.067
AND I THINK THAT THE URBAN

29:06.067 --> 29:07.700
AUDIENCE IS GOING TO LOVE HIM.

29:07.700 --> 29:09.233
I AM TELLING YOU, THIS KID IS A

29:09.233 --> 29:09.933
STAR.

29:09.933 --> 29:11.067
>> YEAH, YOU AND EVERY OTHER

29:11.067 --> 29:12.067
ASSISTANT AT THE LABEL.

29:12.067 --> 29:13.233
>> I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS

29:13.233 --> 29:14.700
RIGHT NOW, BABY, PLEASE.

29:14.700 --> 29:16.367
>> WES, SERIOUSLY, YOU WANT TO

29:16.367 --> 29:16.967
MEET THIS KID.

29:16.967 --> 29:18.433
>> APRIL, YOU'RE MY GIRL AND

29:18.433 --> 29:19.167
ALL, BUT YOU SHOULD STAY IN YOUR

29:19.167 --> 29:20.533
LANE.

29:20.533 --> 29:24.567
I THINK I HEAR PHONES RINGING.

29:24.567 --> 29:26.500
>> WES, YOU SAID THAT IF I

29:26.500 --> 29:27.600
BROUGHT IN TALENT THAT I COULD

29:27.600 --> 29:28.633
MOVE UP TO A&R.

29:28.633 --> 29:30.067
>> [groans]

29:30.067 --> 29:31.067
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, THEN YOU

29:31.067 --> 29:32.067
WON'T MIND IF I TAKE HIM TO MY

29:32.067 --> 29:34.333
FRIEND AT DEF JAM SOUTH?

29:34.333 --> 29:36.967
>> ALL RIGHT, BRING HIM THROUGH

29:36.967 --> 29:39.467
TOMORROW AT 2:00.

29:39.467 --> 29:41.700
>> THANK YOU.

29:41.700 --> 29:43.433
OH, NO, WAIT.

29:43.433 --> 29:46.433
UM, CAN WE DO 3:00?

29:46.433 --> 29:47.533
>> 2:00, APRIL.

29:47.533 --> 29:51.633
ONE, TWO. 2:00, PLEASE.

29:58.267 --> 30:00.733
>> LOOK AT HER, SO SWEET, SO

30:00.733 --> 30:02.733
INNOCENT.

30:02.733 --> 30:04.200
>> SO EASY.

30:04.200 --> 30:05.600
A GUY BRINGS HER FLOWERS AND

30:05.600 --> 30:06.667
SHE'S GONE.

30:06.667 --> 30:07.800
YOU'D THINK HE BOUGHT HER A

30:07.800 --> 30:08.667
MASERATI.

30:08.667 --> 30:09.533
>> I KNEW IT WAS RISKY WHEN I

30:09.533 --> 30:10.433
BOUGHT THE TICKETS WITHOUT

30:10.433 --> 30:12.067
ASKING YOU, SO I'M GIVING YOU AN

30:12.067 --> 30:12.800
OUT.

30:12.800 --> 30:13.667
>> ARE YOU KIDDING?

30:13.667 --> 30:14.933
I LOVE COLDPLAY.

30:14.933 --> 30:16.367
I WOULD SING YELLOW FOR YOU, BUT

30:16.367 --> 30:18.267
YOU'D NEVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.

30:18.267 --> 30:19.500
>> GREAT, THEN IT'S A DATE.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.067
AND AFTERWARDS, WE'LL CELEBRATE.

30:21.067 --> 30:22.467
>> WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING?

30:22.467 --> 30:23.133
>> I GOT THE JOB.

30:23.133 --> 30:23.833
>> [gasps]

30:23.833 --> 30:24.600
YOU'RE MOVING TO ATLANTA?

30:24.600 --> 30:25.267
THAT'S GREAT.

30:25.267 --> 30:26.067
>> YEP.

30:26.067 --> 30:27.067
SO, I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

30:27.067 --> 30:27.800
I'VE GOT TO FIND A PLACE TO

30:27.800 --> 30:28.467
LIVE.

30:28.467 --> 30:29.133
>> OKAY.

30:29.133 --> 30:30.133
>> ALL RIGHT.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.467
>> WHAT'S UP, COLGATE?

30:36.467 --> 30:37.467
>> SHUT UP.

30:37.467 --> 30:39.167
BLAKE GOT THE JOB, AND IT LOOKS

30:39.167 --> 30:41.233
LIKE I HAVE A NEW BOYFRIEND.

30:41.233 --> 31:04.867
THAT DOESN'T GO THERE.

31:04.867 --> 31:05.800
[click]

31:05.800 --> 31:06.500
>> HEY!

31:06.500 --> 31:07.733
>> HEY.

31:07.733 --> 31:10.467
MMM, I THINK YOU COULD GO A SIZE

31:10.467 --> 31:12.433
BIGGER.

31:12.433 --> 31:13.933
I READ ABOUT YOUR DIVORCE.

31:13.933 --> 31:14.967
I'M REALLY SORRY.

31:14.967 --> 31:16.333
IT MUST HAVE BEEN TOUGH.

31:16.333 --> 31:17.633
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:17.633 --> 31:18.767
>> YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS TOUGH?

31:18.767 --> 31:20.633
WHEN A SMALL BUSINESSWOMAN'S

31:20.633 --> 31:22.500
JUST TRYING TO STAY IN BUSINESS

31:22.500 --> 31:23.967
AND THE NOUVEAU RICHE CHICKS

31:23.967 --> 31:25.233
LIKE YOU DON'T PAY THEIR BILLS.

31:25.233 --> 31:26.867
I MEAN, IT'D BE A SHAME IF

31:26.867 --> 31:28.500
NECOLE BITCHIE GOT THE STORY

31:28.500 --> 31:29.900
WITH PHOTOS.

31:29.900 --> 31:31.167
>> ARE YOU CRAZY?

31:31.167 --> 31:33.233
>> YEAH, I KIND OF AM.

31:33.233 --> 31:34.733
>> GET OUT!

31:34.733 --> 31:35.867
>> I'M GOIN'.

31:35.867 --> 31:38.900
OH, AND, UM, AFTER YOU PAY UP,

31:38.900 --> 31:40.200
NO HARD FEELINGS?

31:40.200 --> 31:43.767
HERE.

31:43.767 --> 31:45.267
I EVEN HAVE A SEXY TOP YOU CAN

31:45.267 --> 31:49.067
ROCK WITH THOSE JEANS.

31:55.500 --> 31:56.967
>> DID EVERYTHING WORK OUT?

31:56.967 --> 31:58.400
>> THE NEW GIRL SHOOK ME DOWN,

31:58.400 --> 32:00.067
TOLD ME IF I DIDN'T PAY MY TAB,

32:00.067 --> 32:01.733
SHE'D TELL NECOLE BITCHIE.

32:01.733 --> 32:03.067
>> [gasps] WHAT?

32:03.067 --> 32:04.200
OH, GRETCHEN, THAT'S

32:04.200 --> 32:05.300
INEXCUSABLE.

32:05.300 --> 32:07.067
I CAN'T APOLOGIZE ENOUGH.

32:07.067 --> 32:08.233
>> JUST PUT THE WHOLE THING ON

32:08.233 --> 32:09.100
THERE.

32:09.100 --> 32:10.867
>> YOU KNOW, SHE'S MY NEW

32:10.867 --> 32:12.567
INTERN, BUT THAT IS NO EXCUSE.

32:12.567 --> 32:13.867
I DO NOT TREAT MY CUSTOMERS THIS

32:13.867 --> 32:14.633
WAY.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.700
>> I SHOULD HOPE NOT.

32:16.700 --> 32:18.233
>> CHRISTINA WILL BE DEALT WITH.

32:18.233 --> 32:20.100
THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

32:20.100 --> 32:20.833
YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:20.833 --> 32:22.067
I WILL JUST EMAIL YOU YOUR

32:22.067 --> 32:23.067
RECEIPT.

32:23.067 --> 32:26.133
AGAIN, I'M SO SORRY.

32:30.067 --> 32:31.133
>> I KNOW.

32:31.133 --> 32:33.067
I'M FIRED, HUH?

32:33.067 --> 32:35.433
>> NOT THIS TIME, BUT DON'T LET

32:35.433 --> 32:37.400
IT HAPPEN AGAIN.

32:42.467 --> 32:44.400
>> APRIL HAS APOLOGIZED AND

32:44.400 --> 32:45.767
ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

32:45.767 --> 32:48.600
DAMAGE SHE'S DONE.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.367
>> NICE OF HER.

32:50.367 --> 32:51.900
>> DO YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD

32:51.900 --> 32:53.367
EVER FIND IT IN YOURSELF TO

32:53.367 --> 32:58.467
ACCEPT HER APOLOGY?

32:58.467 --> 33:00.233
THERE MUST BE SOME REASON WHY

33:00.233 --> 33:02.233
YOU CAME HERE TODAY, SOMETHING

33:02.233 --> 33:04.667
THAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR OR TO

33:04.667 --> 33:09.067
COMMUNICATE TO APRIL.

33:09.067 --> 33:12.067
OKAY, WELL, I GUESS WE'LL END IT

33:12.067 --> 33:15.767
HERE, THEN.

33:20.433 --> 33:22.867
>> I MISS YOU, DARRYL.

33:22.867 --> 33:24.767
I MISS US.

33:24.767 --> 33:26.333
AND I KNOW THAT I HAVE NO RIGHT

33:26.333 --> 33:31.067
TO EXPECT YOU TO FORGIVE ME.

33:31.067 --> 33:33.333
I JUST HOPE YOU WILL.

33:33.333 --> 33:36.867
>> I TRUSTED YOU.

33:44.367 --> 33:46.767
THINGS WEREN'T PERFECT.

33:46.767 --> 33:48.567
I FELT SOME DISTANCE, BUT I

33:48.567 --> 33:49.900
FIGURED, WHATEVER SHE WAS GOING

33:49.900 --> 33:51.167
THROUGH, WE'D GO THROUGH IT

33:51.167 --> 33:52.800
TOGETHER.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.500
I KNOW MARRIAGE ISN'T ALL HAPPY

33:54.500 --> 33:56.500
ALL THE TIME.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.200
IT'S GETTING THROUGH THE ROUGH

33:58.200 --> 34:00.433
PATCHES THAT MAKES IT STRONGER.

34:00.433 --> 34:02.300
THERE ARE A LOT OF WOMEN IN

34:02.300 --> 34:04.067
ATLANTA, BUT NO WOMAN IN THE

34:04.067 --> 34:05.667
WORLD COULD EVER MAKE ME CHEAT

34:05.667 --> 34:07.233
ON YOU, HURT YOU, AND BETRAY

34:07.233 --> 34:08.733
YOU.

34:08.733 --> 34:10.333
BETRAY US.

34:10.333 --> 34:13.067
>> AND I AM SO SORRY.

34:13.067 --> 34:14.733
I MADE A MISTAKE.

34:14.733 --> 34:16.100
>> I KEEP ASKING MYSELF,

34:16.100 --> 34:17.700
HOW--HOW COULD SHE?

34:17.700 --> 34:19.233
>> GOOD, DARRYL.

34:19.233 --> 34:20.300
CONTINUE.

34:20.300 --> 34:21.533
DON'T WORRY ABOUT GOING OVER

34:21.533 --> 34:23.933
THE ALLOTTED TIME.

34:23.933 --> 34:25.400
>> I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE YANKED MY

34:25.400 --> 34:27.600
WORLD OUT FROM UNDER ME.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.800
WHEN YOU THINK YOU KNOW SOMEONE

34:28.800 --> 34:31.200
AND THEN ONE DAY YOU WAKE UP AND

34:31.200 --> 34:33.133
THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING SO

34:33.133 --> 34:35.933
REPREHENSIBLE, NOTHING MAKES

34:35.933 --> 34:37.133
SENSE ANYMORE.

34:37.133 --> 34:38.867
YOU HAVE TO RE-EVALUATE

34:38.867 --> 34:41.067
EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER BELIEVED

34:41.067 --> 34:42.333
AND...

34:42.333 --> 34:43.400
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN TO

34:43.400 --> 34:47.067
TRY AND FORGIVE HER.

34:47.067 --> 34:48.767
>> [laughs]

34:48.767 --> 34:49.800
>> OH, MY GOD.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.300
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE.

34:51.300 --> 34:52.700
OH, I KNEW IT.

34:52.700 --> 34:53.767
I KNEW YOU'D LOVE MAC.

34:53.767 --> 34:55.733
>> OH, HE'S AS GOOD AS YOU SAID.

34:55.733 --> 34:56.667
BETTER.

34:56.667 --> 34:58.367
WE SIGNED HIM.

34:58.367 --> 35:00.633
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

35:00.633 --> 35:01.633
>> THANK YOU.

35:01.633 --> 35:02.467
THIS IS CRAZY.

35:02.467 --> 35:03.733
THESE GUYS RIGHT HERE, THE

35:03.733 --> 35:04.900
COOLEST.

35:04.900 --> 35:06.200
GONNA GIVE ME PLAY.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.633
>> HEY, THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO

35:07.633 --> 35:08.833
HEAR.

35:08.833 --> 35:09.967
>> LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

35:09.967 --> 35:11.867
>> SO, UH, WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?

35:11.867 --> 35:13.267
>> OH, NEXT WE MAKE SOME HITS.

35:13.267 --> 35:14.700
DANTE ALREADY KNOWS WHICH

35:14.700 --> 35:15.867
PRODUCERS HE WANTS TO PUT HIM IN

35:15.867 --> 35:17.367
THE STUDIO WITH.

35:17.367 --> 35:19.333
OH, BABY, NO WORRIES.

35:19.333 --> 35:20.200
YOU'RE GONNA GET YOUR FINDER'S

35:20.200 --> 35:21.267
FEE FOR BRINGING HIM IN.

35:21.267 --> 35:22.067
>> A FINDER'S FEE?

35:22.067 --> 35:23.600
WES, YOU SAID IF I BROUGHT IN AN

35:23.600 --> 35:25.167
ARTIST, I COULD A&R THE PROJECT.

35:25.167 --> 35:26.933
>> BUT YOU WEREN'T HERE.

35:26.933 --> 35:28.933
I CLEAR MY BOOKS BECAUSE YOU'VE

35:28.933 --> 35:30.267
BEGGED ME TO BRING THIS KID IN

35:30.267 --> 35:31.767
AND IT'S NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH

35:31.767 --> 35:34.167
FOR YOU TO SHOW?

35:34.167 --> 35:35.500
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE MAD, BE MAD

35:35.500 --> 35:37.433
AT YOURSELF.

35:37.433 --> 35:39.133
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, LET'S DO

35:39.133 --> 35:40.233
THIS.

35:40.233 --> 35:41.167
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO THE

35:41.167 --> 35:43.067
BIG MIX FAMILY.

35:54.100 --> 35:55.367
>> OH.

35:55.367 --> 35:57.533
UH, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN FOR

35:57.533 --> 35:59.200
A WHILE.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.933
>> I'M SORRY.

36:00.933 --> 36:02.633
YOU'RE JUST SO SEXY AND I REALLY

36:02.633 --> 36:03.967
LIKE YOU.

36:03.967 --> 36:06.200
IS THERE A CLAUSE IN THAT 90-DAY

36:06.200 --> 36:07.133

36:09.833 --> 36:10.933
>> HMM.

36:10.933 --> 36:12.667
I'M PULLING UP THE CONTRACT IN

36:12.667 --> 36:16.233
MY HEAD AND, YEAH, I THINK THE

36:16.233 --> 36:17.667
COURT WILL ALLOW IT.

36:17.667 --> 36:20.067
>> [laughs]

36:20.067 --> 36:22.400

36:22.400 --> 36:24.567
>> RIGHT NOW I'M KISSING YOUR

36:24.567 --> 36:25.333
BREAST.

36:25.333 --> 36:26.067

36:26.067 --> 36:27.500
>> AND NOW I'M GOING DOWN TO

36:27.500 --> 36:28.467

36:37.900 --> 36:38.700
>> AND NOW...

36:38.700 --> 36:39.467
>> UH-HUH.

36:39.467 --> 36:41.600
>> I COME BACK UP TO YOUR MOUTH

36:41.600 --> 36:43.067
AND I KISS YOU SOME MORE.

36:43.067 --> 36:45.667
>> OH, WHY'D YOU COME BACK UP?

36:45.667 --> 36:46.733
GO BACK DOWN.

36:46.733 --> 36:49.433
I LIKE WHERE YOU WERE GOING.

36:49.433 --> 36:50.500
>> SORRY.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.100
>> THAT'S OKAY.

36:52.100 --> 36:53.933
>> AND NOW I'M KISSING YOUR

36:53.933 --> 36:54.933

36:54.933 --> 36:55.733

36:55.733 --> 36:57.267
>> AND NOW I MOVE AROUND TO YOUR

36:57.267 --> 36:58.067
HIPS.

36:58.067 --> 36:59.800
YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL HIPS.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.267
>> BLAKE, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T

37:01.267 --> 37:02.400
HAVE TO BE A GENTLEMAN.

37:02.400 --> 37:03.867
WE'RE JUST TALKING.

37:03.867 --> 37:05.167
YOU CAN TELL ME HOW YOU WANT TO

37:05.167 --> 37:05.967
KISS ME THERE.

37:05.967 --> 37:11.233

37:19.367 --> 37:20.833
>> HUH?

37:20.833 --> 37:22.833
WHY NOT?

37:22.833 --> 37:24.933
>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT THIS IS

37:24.933 --> 37:26.067
FOR.

37:26.067 --> 37:29.733
THIS IS ALL A WOMAN NEEDS.

37:29.733 --> 37:31.367
>> BUT WOULDN'T YOU WANT ME TO

37:31.367 --> 37:32.533
DO THAT TO YOU?

37:32.533 --> 37:33.533
>> OF COURSE.

37:33.533 --> 37:34.833
IT'S NATURAL FOR A WOMAN TO DO

37:34.833 --> 37:35.900
IT TO A MAN.

37:35.900 --> 37:37.100
BUT ME?

37:37.100 --> 37:38.467
NO.

37:38.467 --> 37:40.067
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

37:40.067 --> 37:45.067
IT'S UNMANLY.

37:45.067 --> 37:47.767
>> [sighs]

37:47.767 --> 37:48.967
>> YOU'RE SERIOUS?

37:48.967 --> 37:50.300
THAT'S REALLY A DEAL-BREAKER?

37:50.300 --> 37:51.400
>> ABSOLUTELY.

37:51.400 --> 37:56.867
YOU HAVE TO GIVE TO RECEIVE.

37:56.867 --> 37:58.467
>> [sighs]

38:09.267 --> 38:10.800
>> HELLO, BEAUTIFUL.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.200
I KNEW YOU'D COME.

38:12.200 --> 38:15.367
>> YOU OWE ME AN APOLOGY.

38:15.367 --> 38:16.600
>> NOTHING VENTURED, NOTHING

38:16.600 --> 38:20.967
GAINED.

38:20.967 --> 38:26.733
WHOA, KEISHA.

38:26.733 --> 38:29.100

38:42.800 --> 38:44.500
HEY.

YEAH, SHE BROUGHT IT.

38:48.067 --> 38:50.300
YEAH, SHE'S GONE.

38:50.300 --> 38:53.200
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU, MAN.

39:07.067 --> 39:08.667
>> SURPRISING THING, RIGHT?

39:08.667 --> 39:10.367
>> IT SURPRISED ME.

39:12.333 --> 39:13.267
>> * WELL, I'M JUST GONNA LET *

39:15.867 --> 39:17.167

39:17.167 --> 39:18.433

39:18.433 --> 39:20.300

39:20.300 --> 39:21.733
I SKIMMED A LITTLE OFF THE TOP

39:21.733 --> 39:22.867
FOR MY TROUBLE.

39:24.800 --> 39:26.133
BUT GET THIS.

39:26.133 --> 39:27.567

39:28.333 --> 39:29.233

39:29.233 --> 39:30.300
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

39:30.300 --> 39:31.900
>> UH, YEAH.

39:31.900 --> 39:33.333
LOOK AT IT FROM HIS POINT OF

39:33.333 --> 39:34.067
VIEW.

39:34.067 --> 39:35.867
HE SUSPECTS YOU STOLE HIS WATCH.

39:35.867 --> 39:37.200
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE READ ABOUT YOU

39:37.200 --> 39:38.567
IN THAT BOOK JASMINE WROTE.

39:38.567 --> 39:41.067
AND YOU MAKE IT NO SECRET THAT

39:41.067 --> 39:42.567
YOU ONLY DATE MEN WITH MONEY.

39:42.567 --> 39:43.767
>> BUT I REALLY LIKE HIM.

39:43.767 --> 39:45.700
HE JUST HAPPENS TO HAVE MONEY.

39:45.700 --> 39:47.300
AND SINCE WHEN DO YOU CARE ABOUT

39:47.300 --> 39:48.500
MALCOLM'S POINT OF VIEW?

39:48.500 --> 39:49.267
>> I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

39:49.267 --> 39:50.167
I'M JUST TRYING TO GIVE YOU

39:50.167 --> 39:51.400
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT BEFORE

39:51.400 --> 39:52.967

40:15.533 --> 40:16.467
HE DOESN'T DINE ON SOUTHERN

40:16.467 --> 40:17.200

40:17.200 --> 40:17.900
>> OH.

40:23.433 --> 40:24.500
>> OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

40:24.500 --> 40:25.867
ONE OF HIS EX-GIRLFRIENDS HAD

40:25.867 --> 40:29.033
MENTIONED THAT A LONG TIME AGO.

40:29.033 --> 40:30.367
MY BAD.

40:30.367 --> 40:32.433

40:32.433 --> 40:34.167
APRIL, HOW COULD YOU DO ME LIKE

40:34.167 --> 40:34.867

I TOTALLY FORGOT.

40:37.333 --> 40:38.367

40:38.367 --> 40:39.500
JUST FOR THAT, YOU CAN'T HAVE

40:39.500 --> 40:40.433
ANY OF THE GOOD STUFF.

40:40.433 --> 40:41.100
