WEBVTT

00:21.855 --> 00:23.231
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.066
- Mr. Wagner?
- Yes, right this way.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.742
Morning, Detective. Susan's out.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.038
Well, actually, I'm here to see you.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.207
I wanted you to know
I wouldn't be working for you anymore.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.210
I'm sorry to hear that. It looked like
you and Susan were getting along.

00:45.336 --> 00:47.172
- Scheduling problems?
- Not really.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.424
I just don't want to be taking your money.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.468
Why's that?

00:52.135 --> 00:54.888
Well, this way,
if you keep beating her up,

00:54.888 --> 00:56.556
I can do something about it.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.308
You working for her now?

00:58.683 --> 01:00.393
Hmm, nah. Just the police department.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.896
Then maybe you'll consider
that this situation

01:02.896 --> 01:06.149
is a little more complicated
than you've been led to understand.

01:08.276 --> 01:11.404
Nothing complicated about those bruises
on your wife's face, Mr. Wagner.

01:11.529 --> 01:15.533
You are beyond
your depth, Detective Kelly.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.285
Our conversation is over.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.578
I'm done, too.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.248
Just to let you know
that if you hit her again,

01:22.957 --> 01:24.459
you're going to be sorry you ever met me.

03:15.403 --> 03:17.488
- Detective.
- What-ho?

03:17.906 --> 03:20.158
- What-ho.
- What's going on in there?

03:20.700 --> 03:22.327
Uh, Walker just caught a case.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.495
Now he's voicing some reservations

03:24.495 --> 03:26.456
to the Lieutenant about me working backup.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.666
- This is going to take some time, Andy.
- Come on, John.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.501
Please, I understand my situation.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.212
I spent a long period
of time being sauced.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.631
I need to win back my colleagues' trust.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.508
I've got to exhibit
a continuous positive approach.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.928
Even with this dim bulb here.

03:41.137 --> 03:43.765
Sipowicz, Kelly, robbery, double homicide.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.726
Liquor store over on James Street.
You guys want to give me a hand?

03:46.976 --> 03:49.395
- Yeah, sure. Give me.
- Our pleasure.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.606
Uh, here's the address.
I'll see you over there.

03:54.734 --> 03:58.529
 That was positive, wasn't it?
"Our pleasure."

03:59.447 --> 04:00.448
Fair.

04:00.698 --> 04:03.993
What should I have said?
"Our pleasure, rooty-toot-toot"?

04:09.290 --> 04:10.708
Can I talk to you
for a minute, Detective?

04:10.917 --> 04:12.168
Yeah.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.671
I'll, uh, I'll see you outside, all right?

04:15.129 --> 04:16.965
Yeah, sure.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.635
- Sipowicz
- Catch you later, Ted.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.513
- Did you go to your dad's service?
- Yeah, I just got back.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.932
- How'd your mother hold up?
- Okay.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.475
Yeah.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.811
I wanted to thank you for being
there for me the other night.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.229
Ah, it's all right.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.900
- John, I don't want it to be over for us.
- This is not the place to talk about it.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.443
Well, It's not like you let me
pick my spots.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.112
Okay.

04:39.904 --> 04:42.282
I admit I have feelings for you,
but it's not going to work out for us.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.284
I'm not going to take that, for an answer,
we can make it work out.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.119
I got to go, all right?

04:56.671 --> 04:58.089
I'd just
walked into the store

04:58.089 --> 04:59.549
behind these other two guys.

05:00.091 --> 05:03.177
And this guy, he comes out
from the back room with a gun.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.513
And he made us all come over
to this aisle here,

05:05.638 --> 05:06.848
and lie on our stomachs.

05:07.056 --> 05:09.434
- Did you get a look at him?
- Yeah, pretty good.

05:10.018 --> 05:13.563
He was a white guy,
uh, tall, about 50 years old.

05:13.688 --> 05:17.567
He had on like
a black trench coat, down below his knees.

05:17.692 --> 05:21.529
He was like six-three,
six-four. Good sized.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.949
Any marks you noticed
on his face or hands? Any facial hairs?

05:25.158 --> 05:28.536
Yeah, he had... had a mustache,
and he smelled like he'd been drinking.

05:28.870 --> 05:32.832
He, uh, he came and stood over us,
and that's when I heard the click,

05:32.957 --> 05:34.292
from the gun over my head.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.586
- Kelly.
- Thank God he must've used...

05:36.586 --> 05:38.296
White, uh, 45, or, so.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.173
- Around six feet tall?
- Yeah.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.133
All right, let's get
these people over to the precinct.

05:42.592 --> 05:43.968
- Have them take a look at some pictures.
- Okay, all right.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.136
Yeah.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.348
My guy makes the perp
about six-three, or four,

05:48.348 --> 05:49.682
He's 50-years old, a mustache...

05:49.682 --> 05:51.392
Yeah, let's get
them over to the precinct.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.478
Here's, uh, the licenses

05:53.603 --> 05:55.229
- from the cars parked outside.
- Okay.

05:55.646 --> 05:59.025
Hey, Walker, we don't have to hold hands,
but would you mind not talking to me

05:59.025 --> 06:00.568
like I'm Timmy, the laundry boy?

06:00.568 --> 06:02.195
You gave me
the license numbers

06:02.195 --> 06:03.529
for the canvass. I said "Okay."

06:03.529 --> 06:05.865
Yeah, all right. Okay, fine.
It's my mistake. All right?

06:07.033 --> 06:08.117
You got a minute, Kelly?

06:13.539 --> 06:16.334
This is notice. I'm not taking any crap
from your fat friend.

06:16.334 --> 06:19.170
- Why don't you give him a square shot.
- I'll give him the shot he earns.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.881
But I'm telling you, if that drunk
screws up my case

06:21.881 --> 06:23.883
- I'm going to hang his ass in the win...
- You're not paying attention Walker.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.426
He hasn't had a drink in over two months.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.637
So, why don't you take your attitude,
and shove it up your ass?

06:28.304 --> 06:30.223
Is this something
the whole class can appreciate?

06:31.432 --> 06:32.517
We're done.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.186
Folks, let's take a ride
over to the Precinct house,

06:35.311 --> 06:38.439
try, and make a photo ID.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.987
- Hey, Detective.
- Hey.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.907
See me on your way out.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.034
Don't stop till you die.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.579
Okay, we'll take you upstairs
and show you some pictures.

06:53.746 --> 06:54.956
See if you can identify anyone.

06:55.998 --> 06:58.042
Mrs. Wagner.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.086
What's happening?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.797
My husband just told me
you won't be working for us anymore.

07:02.797 --> 07:03.965
Yeah, that's right.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.718
Uh, how's the eye?

07:08.344 --> 07:11.097
It's fine. Please don't quit, Mr. Kelly.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.976
Mrs. Wagner, you don't need a bodyguard
for when you go out in public.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.978
Your problem is a domestic situation.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.772
Now, my advice is
if your husband hits you again,

07:19.772 --> 07:22.733
just file a criminal complaint,
or move out on him.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.696
What you shouldn't do is stay
in that big apartment and take it.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.574
Or talk the way you were the other night,

07:29.740 --> 07:32.118
which sounded like you were soliciting
me to commit a crime.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.289
When I said that I wished something
would happen to him, I was upset.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.666
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- Okay, maybe I misunderstood.

07:39.208 --> 07:42.462
But, Mrs. Wagner, a lot of women
that have husbands like yours

07:42.587 --> 07:44.213
can't do anything to help themselves.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.800
You can. You can make a choice. Do it.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.886
You're indulging a prejudice, Mr. Kelly.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.015
Affluence doesn't always
purchase opportunity.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.986
Take a look at these.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.534
- Hey, Sipowicz.
- What?

08:17.246 --> 08:18.998
My witness just ID'd this guy.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.001
He's got two priors for armed robbery.
Show him to your people.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.004
Hey, wait...
wait this guy's five-nine.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.797
So what?

08:26.923 --> 08:29.133
Our statements made the perp
at six-three, or four.

08:29.258 --> 08:30.384
Mine said around six.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.762
Hey, Sipowicz, people look taller
when you're lying on the ground.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.013
Show them the photograph.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.647
New faces.

08:43.814 --> 08:47.068
- No? All right, take your time.
- Look at these carefully now.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.736
This doesn't have to be fast.
We got plenty more pictures.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.863
- No, I don't recognize...
- No!

08:51.822 --> 08:53.282
Kelly.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.246
I got a positive ID from one witness.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.414
The guy's name is, Coleman.

09:00.414 --> 09:02.291
He's got the right priors.
I want to pick him up.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.877
- Sipowicz thinks he may be too short.
- No, no, no, no.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.421
Let's pick him up.
Maybe he was wearing lifts.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.184
Yeah, Bensonhurst, John.
It's a likely locale, huh?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.229
Guy lives here, wants to rob
a liquor store in downtown Manhattan.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.023
All he's got to do is make like, what,
nine, ten subway transfers?

09:26.023 --> 09:29.485
Well, maybe he had business downtown,
and came back, and did the store then.

09:29.610 --> 09:32.405
Yeah, right. Maybe his doctor's down
on James Street, huh?

09:32.530 --> 09:34.865
The one that gives him
his hormone injections that pump him up

09:34.991 --> 09:37.159
to six-three when
he's about to pull a job.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.286
- Yeah.
- And then shrink him down to his normal

09:38.411 --> 09:39.662
five-nine right afterward, huh?

09:43.082 --> 09:44.542
So, what's going on with you,
and that girl?

09:47.336 --> 09:48.504
Which girl?

09:48.754 --> 09:50.715
The one we haven't
been talking about. Licalsi.

09:51.507 --> 09:54.260
- Nothing's going on.
- Hey, hey, you're a divorced man, John.

09:55.052 --> 09:57.305
It's a healthy urge.
If she worked at a topless bar,

09:57.305 --> 09:59.432
- I'd probably take a shot at her myself.
- Nothing is going on,

09:59.432 --> 10:00.683
and here's the guy, Andy.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.519
(EXHALES DEEPLY) All right,
let's take the bastard.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.022
If he didn't do the liquor store,
maybe he did something else.

10:08.065 --> 10:10.443
Oh, look at this, John.
Where's his mustache, huh?

10:10.651 --> 10:13.112
- Our witness said he had a mustache.
- People shave.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.032
- Police officers. Are you Howard Coleman?
- Yeah.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.075
We need to talk to you
about your activities this morning.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.744
I didn't have any activities.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.121
I went to the drugstore.
That's the first I went out.

10:22.121 --> 10:25.041
You were seen on James Street
this morning in Manhattan.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.001
I wasn't there. You get off my property.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.753
All right, we're going to have
to take you in for questioning.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.838
- Come on.
- You better have a warrant, or you better

10:31.047 --> 10:32.298
- get the hell away from...
- Don't make this any tougher

10:32.298 --> 10:33.466
- than it has to be.
- Daddy, what's the matter?

10:33.633 --> 10:34.759
- Okay?
- Go back inside.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.177
- Here, take this. It's your medicine.
- Come on!

10:37.136 --> 10:38.512
Hey! Hey! Hey!

10:38.512 --> 10:39.597
- Daddy!
- Take it easy.

10:39.847 --> 10:40.848
- Stop it! Daddy.
- Stay down.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.767
- You're hurting him!
- Calm down, nobody's gonna get hurt.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.727
- It's okay. It's all right.
- Now you're under arrest

10:44.894 --> 10:46.103
- pal!
- Take it easy.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.980
Daddy.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.024
- Daddy!
- It's all right.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.985
- Sure acts innocent, doesn't he, Sipowicz?
- No!

11:01.035 --> 11:02.620
You didn't rob any liquor store,
right, Coleman?

11:02.620 --> 11:04.997
You always carry 850 bucks
around in your pocket.

11:05.414 --> 11:08.292
- Where'd you get that money?
- I bet a horse yesterday.

11:08.459 --> 11:09.919
Which horse? Where? What race was he in?

11:10.294 --> 11:12.630
Some horse at Aqueduct.
I don't remember the name.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.882
Look, no one's saying
you went in that store to do murder.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.008
Now, what happened there?

11:16.300 --> 11:18.552
Taking the place off, and someone
tried to get violent with you?

11:18.761 --> 11:20.763
- Hey, what's your name again?
- Detective Walker.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.432
Detective Walker,
I was never near any liquor store

11:23.432 --> 11:25.351
on James Street today.
I wasn't in Manhattan,

11:25.351 --> 11:26.519
so why don't you kiss my ass?

11:26.644 --> 11:28.437
What if I give you a broken jaw, huh?

11:28.604 --> 11:30.690
You better make sure these guys
are holding me down.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.733
Here we go. That's it, Walker.
Come on.

11:33.317 --> 11:35.403
- There you go.
- Hey, hey Howard,

11:35.528 --> 11:37.446
uh, what's wrong with your daughter?

11:38.072 --> 11:40.658
- What do you mean?
- You told her to take some medicine.

11:41.158 --> 11:43.244
It's for her breathing. She's got asthma.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.204
Yeah? I had a kid that had that.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.790
So, what's that supposed to do,
make me love you?

11:48.416 --> 11:53.003
I was hoping you'd get
some deep, warm feelings for me, yeah.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.256
All right, let's get back to the money.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.968
Your ex-wife's here to see you, Detective.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.138
- Uh, thanks.
- Sure.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.692
Hi.

12:19.697 --> 12:20.781
I just quit my job.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.619
What brought that about?

12:26.662 --> 12:29.915
Those creeps had me
in for a cards on the table conversation.

12:30.416 --> 12:34.044
"Laura, we need you to be more forthcoming
about your previous work for the city.

12:34.503 --> 12:37.173
"We need to know their approach
on our clients' variance applications.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.966
"How do they stand on Pynchon, and Dean?"

12:39.091 --> 12:40.134
"Excuse me," I ask.

12:40.342 --> 12:43.429
"So, I guess that stuff when I came here,
how it was me you were interested in,

12:43.429 --> 12:45.598
"and not my contacts
from my previous employment,

12:45.723 --> 12:46.766
"all that was a crock?

12:46.932 --> 12:49.894
"Let's be adults, Laura."

12:50.186 --> 12:52.354
So I told them "They could stick
their job up their ass."

12:53.939 --> 12:55.316
Just your way of giving notice, huh?

12:57.943 --> 13:00.613
You're not going
to say, "I told you so"?

13:00.738 --> 13:02.782
No. Not the type.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.419
- You got plans for dinner?
- You buying?

13:16.587 --> 13:17.713
Pick you up in a couple of hours.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.009
I'm gonna be truthful
with you, Mr. Schauffner.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.094
The way these lineups work,
you're not gonna help me any

13:24.094 --> 13:27.223
if you say, "That could be him,"
or "Maybe that's the guy."

13:27.389 --> 13:31.101
You got to say, "That's him.
I recognize him. That's the guy."

13:31.268 --> 13:32.686
- You follow?
- I understand.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.481
Of course, I'm saying,
if you recognize him.

13:35.856 --> 13:38.400
- Don't say you recognize him if you don't.
- Right.

13:38.526 --> 13:39.860
Well, now, you know what I need,

13:39.985 --> 13:41.445
- so, we can get started right away here.
- Kelly.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.947
It's lineup time.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.825
Walker just finished touching up
the bull's-eye on Coleman's forehead.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.369
All right, come on. Here.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.454
Take a look.

13:53.415 --> 13:54.625
Take your time.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.421
- I see him.
- Which one?

14:01.048 --> 14:02.550
Number three.

14:03.592 --> 14:04.844
Are you sure?

14:05.761 --> 14:09.098
Yeah, I'm sure. Uh, that's the guy.
I recognize him.

14:12.226 --> 14:13.769
I like the guy
real good, Lieutenant.

14:13.936 --> 14:17.231
He did two bits for armed robbery.
We got a positive-witness ID.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.192
Plus, when we pinched him,
he had 850 bucks in his pocket,

14:20.192 --> 14:22.194
he couldn't satisfactorily explain.

14:23.070 --> 14:26.198
- What do you think?
- Looks good so far.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.117
We'll want to see if, uh, Crime Scene

14:28.242 --> 14:30.119
left prints, and so forth
from that liquor store,

14:30.244 --> 14:31.579
but, you know, like he says.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.082
Work it up, give it to the DA.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.837
Lieutenant Fancy.

14:40.337 --> 14:43.007
Yeah, I got a copy of the report.
Yeah, I read it.

14:43.674 --> 14:44.925
Well, in the future, you can assume...

14:48.095 --> 14:50.097
- Thanks for the help.
- Yeah.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.225
- I didn't mean to be so irritable all day.
- No problem.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.436
You son of a bitch!
Why are you doing this to me?

14:55.436 --> 14:56.979
Now, now,
let's get you to the court.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.939
I got to call my daughter,
let her know what's going on.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.024
Yeah, you call her from the tombs.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.277
- I'm telling you, John, he didn't do it.
- Let it unwind, Andy.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.820
- We'll stay on it.
- Yeah, meanwhile,

15:04.820 --> 15:07.156
Coleman eats prison food.

15:10.117 --> 15:13.078
Four-B. How's it going?

15:13.787 --> 15:16.749
Fine, Detective. Do you, uh,
have a, uh, moment for me?

15:16.874 --> 15:18.918
- Yeah, come on.
- Several matters.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.087
First, uh, needless to say,
our tenants' readiness group

15:22.338 --> 15:24.006
is eager to hear your thoughts
tomorrow evening

15:24.131 --> 15:26.842
both on the building security,
and personal safety measures.

15:27.051 --> 15:30.304
Now, is there anything I can do
by way of advance preparation?

15:30.304 --> 15:32.473
Will you have visual aids, and the like

15:32.473 --> 15:34.099
- I can help to set up, no?
- No, no visual aids.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.684
I'll just be talking for a while.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.270
Fine. I've arranged
for some refreshments, and the like.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.190
The other thing, Detective, concerns

15:41.941 --> 15:45.194
the upcoming fifth anniversary
of my, uh, my college graduation.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.614
Uh, the alumni magazine
has asked each member of my class

15:48.614 --> 15:50.658
to write a brief account
of what's become of them in the...

15:50.950 --> 15:54.119
in the intervening years.
And I find surprisingly,

15:54.286 --> 15:55.829
looking back, you know, leaving home,

15:55.829 --> 15:57.581
and moving to New York, and so forth,

15:57.581 --> 16:00.584
that this incident
of getting robbed, and beaten up,

16:00.709 --> 16:02.753
and then dealing
with the man subsequently,

16:03.128 --> 16:06.090
in a way taking back my citizenship,

16:06.298 --> 16:08.550
that whole experience
has been very formative for me.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.595
And I wonder if I can access
your police reports,

16:11.595 --> 16:13.305
so I could write the experience up.

16:13.430 --> 16:16.225
- No.
- No?

16:16.392 --> 16:19.311
I couldn't release them informally to you.
You'd have to fill out an application.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.689
- That would take a...
- Hmm, uh, I really feel

16:21.855 --> 16:23.983
that those reports
would be useful to me.

16:24.191 --> 16:25.359
4B, why don't you...

16:26.610 --> 16:28.654
Why don't you concentrate
on your career highlights,

16:28.654 --> 16:30.572
your accomplishments?
Send that in to your yearbook.

16:30.572 --> 16:32.700
Why write about
a punk who tried to rob you?

16:33.033 --> 16:34.410
Because it's important to me.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.997
I think you're getting
tied up in knots about this.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.915
I... I disagree, Detective.

16:39.915 --> 16:43.252
I feel as though the scales
have... have fallen away from my eyes.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.754
I finally understand this city, you know.

16:45.921 --> 16:49.758
What it takes to deal with it,
how to meet it on its own terms,

16:50.217 --> 16:51.802
what it takes to, you know, help others.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.762
How others,
they... they need to be helped.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.514
This is not <i>High Noon,</i> 4B.

16:55.639 --> 16:58.434
And I have to say
that your reaction typifies.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.645
What the average citizen
can expect from law enforcement.

17:01.812 --> 17:05.482
A... a knowing, haughty indifference.

17:08.068 --> 17:11.447
I got to go, 4B.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.158
Me and my haughty indifference

17:14.158 --> 17:15.951
will be at that tenant meeting
tomorrow night.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.813
Laurie.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.865
Laurie?

18:03.373 --> 18:04.750
Laurie, It's me, John!

18:06.752 --> 18:08.670
Hi, Johnny.
There's a beer in the fridge.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.672
Okay.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.008
I'll just be a minute.

18:27.648 --> 18:32.027
- Can I get you a towel?
- I can get one. Thanks.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.198
Well, I just ran out of excuses
for coming in there.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.993
Since when did you ever need an excuse?

19:16.697 --> 19:18.115
I could cook for us here.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.243
I thought we were going to go out.

19:22.369 --> 19:23.954
- Okay.
- You're not hungry?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.123
No, that's fine.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.382
I think I can get work with someone
I went to school with.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.678
- Jimmy Craig.
- James Craig who prosecutes narcotics?

19:40.012 --> 19:41.763
Yeah, in the district attorney's office.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.808
You're kidding me.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.102
No, I'm not kidding.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.063
Are you nuts, Laurie?
Those people are scumbags.

19:50.230 --> 19:52.524
- You don't know Jimmy Craig.
- I'm not talking about Jimmy Craig.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.359
I'm talking about
the people you prosecute.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.321
I didn't realize
I needed a note from you.

19:57.321 --> 20:00.157
Hey, I am not out in the streets,
so you can wind up

20:00.157 --> 20:01.617
dealing with creeps like that.

20:03.118 --> 20:05.746
It's a job, John.
I'm not mud wrestling with them.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.123
Look, I don't even know
if I'm going to do it.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.917
But don't load me down
with teenage fantasies

20:09.917 --> 20:12.127
about making the world safe
while I stay home and bake.

20:12.419 --> 20:15.464
- It made me crazy while we were married.
- Okay, and that was just sex right?

20:15.756 --> 20:17.925
- You got in the shower with me.
- Did you push me away?

20:32.940 --> 20:33.941
You're right.

20:36.401 --> 20:37.486
This has to stop.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.784
I just kept hoping
that we could remain close.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.119
I mean, we've always...
...been each other's best friend.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.747
- I want to stay close.
- But we can't.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.123
It's too complicated.

20:50.123 --> 20:52.125
We can't stay inside the lines.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.171
Perfect.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.689
Yeah, this is Detective John Kelly
of the 15th Squad.

21:13.689 --> 21:19.069
I have a shooting victim, DOA,
at 626 Park Avenue, 12th floor.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.780
No, no apartment number.
The whole floor's an apartment.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.493
You want some water
or something to drink?

21:27.035 --> 21:29.496
- No.
- You wanna tell me what happened?

21:31.373 --> 21:33.959
He was drunk. Uh, we argued.

21:34.668 --> 21:35.961
In fact, we argued about you.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.048
He hit me, I went into the bedroom,
and got the gun.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.633
I came back, and told him to leave.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.594
- He hit me again, and I shot him.
- Where'd you get the gun?

21:44.761 --> 21:46.596
He gave it to me a year ago
when another apartment

21:46.596 --> 21:47.889
in the building was robbed.

21:48.223 --> 21:51.059
Okay, so you went
into the bedroom and got it

21:51.435 --> 21:53.353
- after he struck you the first time?
- Yes.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.689
Okay, did you tell him
you were going to do this?

21:56.106 --> 21:58.317
No, he went to get a drink,
and that's when I got the gun.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.279
Okay.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.156
I want you to tell me again
what happened when you

22:04.156 --> 22:05.365
came out of the bedroom.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.328
- I told him to leave, and he hit me.
- Hmm.

22:09.536 --> 22:11.121
- While you held the gun on him.
- Yes.

22:11.413 --> 22:14.124
- Okay, where did he hit you?
- In the face.

22:14.541 --> 22:15.792
How many times?

22:15.792 --> 22:16.877
- Several times.
- Two, three?

22:16.877 --> 22:18.295
- Three.
- Then what happened?

22:19.463 --> 22:20.964
I pointed the gun, and shot him.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.674
Did he grab at it
while you trained it on him?

22:22.799 --> 22:24.676
No, I took a step back, and then I fired.

22:27.721 --> 22:28.847
Okay.

22:32.351 --> 22:36.772
- Are you sure he hit you, Mrs. Wagner?
- Yes.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.193
I'm surprised that you
would ask me that question.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.737
I don't think you should say any more.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.323
What do you mean?

22:47.616 --> 22:49.368
No new marks, or bruises on you.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.870
The place is clean, no sign of a struggle.

22:52.746 --> 22:55.665
No contact wounds, powder residue
on your husband's body,

22:55.665 --> 22:59.002
the way there would be
if he was shot at close range.

22:59.127 --> 23:02.255
- I'm telling the truth.
- I don't know what happened here tonight,

23:02.381 --> 23:04.674
but you're not telling the truth,
so don't say any more.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.343
Why are you talking to me like this?

23:08.845 --> 23:10.430
Because I've got to take you in,

23:10.806 --> 23:13.058
so shut up until you speak
to your attorney.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.421
<i>♪ All right. ♪</i>

23:51.513 --> 23:52.848
- How's it going, Lieutenant?
- Good morning.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.185
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning, Sergeant.

24:00.188 --> 24:01.773
- How ya doing, Sarge?
- Hey, Detective?

24:02.107 --> 24:03.942
We're throwing a racket
for Hanson tomorrow night.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.735
- The kid's getting married.
- All right, here.

24:09.197 --> 24:10.740
Oh, and who caught
that liquor store homicide

24:10.740 --> 24:12.951
- you were out on yesterday, Detective?
- Walker.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.245
Uh, let me see something come in?

24:15.829 --> 24:16.872
Yeah.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.624
And that's the guy you collared daughter.

24:27.507 --> 24:29.176
You arrested my father yesterday.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.803
The detective handling that
should be here any minute.

24:32.053 --> 24:34.890
My father didn't rob that liquor store.
He didn't shoot those people.

24:36.558 --> 24:37.809
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

24:38.518 --> 24:40.854
I can prove it.

24:42.814 --> 24:45.108
Um, here. Let's go in there.

24:51.364 --> 24:53.658
He was at home when that robbery happened.

24:54.367 --> 24:55.410
He, um.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.705
He books numbers.

24:59.539 --> 25:00.999
He stays at home till
the number comes out.

25:01.124 --> 25:02.417
The money helps with my medical bills.

25:02.417 --> 25:04.377
He didn't tell you
because It violates his parole.

25:04.544 --> 25:06.338
That's why he had 850-dollars.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.714
- when we arrested him.
- Yes.

25:08.215 --> 25:10.217
And you were with him yesterday,
in the house the whole morning?

25:10.509 --> 25:13.595
No, I was at the doctor's.
I have asthma. But I know he was home.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.558
Okay, that's gonna be real helpful.

25:19.392 --> 25:20.936
Are you going to let him go?

25:21.269 --> 25:23.271
We're definitely gonna
keep looking into things.

25:23.271 --> 25:25.857
Why can't you let him go?
I told you he was home.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.319
Now, you see, being at the doctor,

25:29.319 --> 25:32.155
you can't actually verify
your father's whereabouts.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.496
I'm by myself now in that house.

25:40.789 --> 25:44.543
- I'm alone there.
- We got other information coming in.

25:45.126 --> 25:48.338
You keep a good thought how things
are going to work out. Come on.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.802
You got any pets, or anything
to keep you company?

25:53.927 --> 25:56.596
No. I'm allergic.

25:59.599 --> 26:03.019
Uh, I'm up late.

26:03.186 --> 26:05.855
So, uh, if you're worried about anything,
give me a call.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.748
Anything come in about
that liquor store case?

26:23.915 --> 26:26.876
Yeah. We, uh, got an anonymous tip
during the night.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.462
Of course, you already know that,
don't you, Sipowicz?

26:30.380 --> 26:33.383
- Sarge told me you looked at my messages.
- Yeah, I glanced at it.

26:34.384 --> 26:35.677
You know, Someone calls in,
they heard somebody

26:36.011 --> 26:37.846
talking about pulling that job,
we should check it out.

26:38.054 --> 26:41.725
An anonymous tip from a gin mill pay phone
about an overheard conversation.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.476
- Sounds very hot.
- All I'm saying is,

26:43.476 --> 26:44.811
we should check that bar out,

26:44.811 --> 26:47.022
see if anybody knows
anything about that phone call.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.358
Look, Sipowicz, what did you do?
Take a vow to make my life miserable?

26:50.567 --> 26:52.444
We popped the guy who did this.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.779
Right, if you don't come,
I'm going over there by myself.

26:54.779 --> 26:58.366
Maybe you'd like that.
You could toss back a few shots.

27:00.368 --> 27:01.494
Who drives?

27:12.464 --> 27:14.799
I think Mrs. Wagner's patience,
and courtesy

27:14.924 --> 27:16.801
have been abused long enough.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.720
I'm sorry to detain you for so long.

27:19.262 --> 27:21.431
We had to collect the crime scene report.

27:22.098 --> 27:23.683
And medical examiner's findings.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.770
Neither one support
Mrs. Wagner's account of the incident.

27:27.395 --> 27:31.358
In addition, Detective Kelly states
you made an incriminating solicitation

27:31.483 --> 27:34.152
to him the night before.
Unless we get more information,

27:34.152 --> 27:35.278
we're going to have
to arraign this as a murder.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.322
Gentlemen, I'm not going
to try this case

27:37.322 --> 27:38.823
in a detectives' squad room.

27:38.948 --> 27:42.077
Let me... let me assure you,
the absence of powder residue,

27:42.077 --> 27:45.038
does not preclude
a close-range weapon discharge.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.956
Nor does an apartment failing

27:47.082 --> 27:50.168
to show signs of a struggle
mean a struggle didn't happen.

27:50.168 --> 27:54.005
Now, as far as Mrs. Wagner's
ostensibly soliciting Detective Kelly,

27:54.172 --> 27:55.423
to kill her husband...

27:56.091 --> 27:58.468
...it would take me five minutes
to convince a jury,

27:58.468 --> 28:01.805
that was a confused,
and ultimately innocuous remark.

28:01.971 --> 28:04.391
So innocuous, in fact, that at the time,

28:04.391 --> 28:07.227
- the detective choose not to report it.
- Mrs. Wagner.

28:07.435 --> 28:10.146
Talk to me, Detective Kelly,
and only to me.

28:10.313 --> 28:12.357
On which subject,
you should also understand,

28:12.816 --> 28:16.111
that since you failed to give Mrs. Wagner
her Miranda warning,

28:16.111 --> 28:18.947
nothing she said to you
in her apartment last night,

28:18.947 --> 28:21.116
is going to be admissible in court.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.034
She didn't need Miranda.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.328
When she talked to me,
she wasn't a suspect.

28:25.829 --> 28:28.665
But when she became a suspect,
I advised her to keep quiet

28:28.665 --> 28:29.791
until she had counsel.

28:29.791 --> 28:32.836
Well, that's a, uh, difference of opinion
we'll take up before a judge.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.422
And you're just dying
to get to bat on this one, aren't you?

28:36.423 --> 28:39.676
- Pump up that bill.
- What do you think I should do, Detective?

28:39.884 --> 28:41.594
He's not your lawyer, Mrs. Wagner.

28:41.594 --> 28:43.596
Mrs. Wagner, I can imagine
something like this.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.890
Your husband came home. He was loaded.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.767
You were afraid you were going to
get another beating,

28:48.059 --> 28:49.811
so you went
into the bedroom, you got the gun.

28:49.811 --> 28:52.272
When you came out,
you asked him to leave and he wouldn't.

28:52.897 --> 28:56.401
Maybe he started toward you,
and so you shot him from across the room.

28:56.609 --> 28:57.861
- It's not...
- Don't answer.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.696
She's not gonna answer you, Detective.

28:59.696 --> 29:02.198
And If that's the way it happened,
you better say so now.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.826
Because the DA can write
this up as manslaughter.

29:05.201 --> 29:07.954
A legal aid attorney can get you
easy time, maybe even off,

29:07.954 --> 29:09.873
let alone a seven-figure ace like this.

29:09.873 --> 29:12.500
You're wasting
everybody's time, Detective.

29:12.500 --> 29:17.005
JOHN; Mrs. Wagner, don't underestimate us.
If you lie, we will nail you.

29:17.213 --> 29:19.924
Tell the truth,
and I will testify for you.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.594
I will verify that you'd been
beaten up the night before,

29:22.927 --> 29:24.846
and you were emotionally distraught.

29:24.846 --> 29:26.473
- Detective...
- But this smart son of a bitch,

29:26.806 --> 29:28.057
wants you to stick to your story.

29:28.057 --> 29:29.934
That's gonna land you
in central booking,

29:30.143 --> 29:32.395
and Rikers Island
with the whores, and junkies.

29:32.562 --> 29:36.316
Not him, you. So you make the decision.

29:36.524 --> 29:38.026
You're the one
who's gonna be doing the time.

29:38.026 --> 29:41.446
Lieutenant, I want him out of this room
so I can consult with my client.

29:52.749 --> 29:53.917
How's it going, guys?

29:54.793 --> 29:56.085
Were you working here last night?

29:57.045 --> 29:59.672
- I come in around 11:30, pick up receipts.
- Is this your place?

30:00.298 --> 30:03.301
Yeah, uh, night guy comes on around 7:00
if you want to talk to him.

30:03.426 --> 30:06.054
We got information a phone call
was made from here last night,

30:06.179 --> 30:08.973
it may have a connection with
a robbery-homicide we're investigating.

30:09.349 --> 30:12.352
Somebody overheard a guy
talking on that pay phone there.

30:12.352 --> 30:15.104
- About robbing a liquor store yesterday.
- Is that right?

30:15.313 --> 30:16.648
Night guy say anything to you?

30:17.649 --> 30:20.109
Anybody talk to him about
overhearing a call like that?

30:20.109 --> 30:22.320
No, no. Who...
Where'd you get this information?

30:22.445 --> 30:24.197
Look, I'll ask the questions.

30:24.447 --> 30:27.158
- Hey, pal, were you in here last night?
- Don't involve me in this.

30:28.117 --> 30:29.869
Is it a crime to have a beer,
and read the paper?

30:30.245 --> 30:31.955
Hey, hey, hey.
We're only asking you.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.833
Did you hear somebody shooting off
their mouth about pulling a job?

30:34.958 --> 30:37.377
- Or the like
- Absolutely not.

30:38.503 --> 30:41.089
I mind my own business. I don't interfere.

30:41.714 --> 30:43.716
And I expect to be treated
that way in return.

30:44.425 --> 30:46.553
Okay, well, we just
received this hot tip,

30:46.845 --> 30:48.805
and, uh, we're covering all our bases.

30:49.347 --> 30:50.932
Unless you got any more questions.

31:00.441 --> 31:01.985
- Wait here.
- What are you talkin' about?

31:01.985 --> 31:03.444
We're gonna wait.
That's our guy at the bar.

31:03.444 --> 31:05.613
- You, mean that skel sittin' by the phone?
- Yeah. Yeah.

31:05.613 --> 31:07.699
You know you really are
in warped territory now, Sipowicz.

31:07.824 --> 31:10.368
- Yeah, right.
- You got a serious case of dick-brain.

31:10.368 --> 31:13.621
Yeah, and I'm telling you that skel
at the corner knows something, huh?

31:13.621 --> 31:15.290
He's looking for us.
He's been sitting there

31:15.290 --> 31:16.374
- waiting for us to come in.
- God!

31:16.374 --> 31:18.209
- Damn you. I've been waiting here...
- There he is.

31:18.877 --> 31:22.839
Hey. Hey, pal. Hey, yo.
Hey, pal. Come on.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.424
- I wanna ask you a question.
- What do you want? What have I done?

31:24.424 --> 31:26.759
I just wanna talk to you
for a second. Just wanna ask a question.

31:27.093 --> 31:29.012
- What's your name?
- Dwight. This is like the Gestapo,

31:29.137 --> 31:30.847
this is like
a World War II movie in Germany.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.891
You phoned that tip in, didn't you?
Dwight, huh?

31:33.099 --> 31:35.852
You left a message, and you've
been sitting, waiting for us to come in.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.562
I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.647
Listen to me, Dwight! Listen to me now.

31:40.064 --> 31:42.692
Now, You made that call. I know it.
My partner knows it.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.777
And you know it. So let's stop
kidding each other, huh?

31:45.820 --> 31:46.988
I don't know anything,
and I don't wanna...

31:46.988 --> 31:48.323
Just settle down.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.743
Boy, you'd think a person...
...who lives alone and keeps to himself

31:51.743 --> 31:53.202
wouldn't get involved
in something like this.

31:53.328 --> 31:56.164
You are involved, Dwight
because you made that call, right?

31:56.289 --> 31:58.041
Now, Tell me what you know,
about that robbery,

31:58.166 --> 32:00.501
and we'll figure the best way
to keep your name out of it.

32:01.127 --> 32:02.128
Come on!

32:06.841 --> 32:09.177
All I know is that
I wish he would move out.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.678
Who? Move out of where?

32:10.845 --> 32:12.972
Frank Archer. Out of the Delaware Arms.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.600
- On 46th?
- Yeah.

32:16.517 --> 32:17.769
Yeah, what? Come on.

32:19.354 --> 32:21.898
What if I told you he fired a gun off
in his room the other night?

32:21.898 --> 32:24.067
He shot a bullet into the wall.
I share that wall.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.778
I have adult-onset diabetes.
How do you think I felt?

32:26.903 --> 32:28.321
What did he shoot
the gun off for, Dwight?

32:28.488 --> 32:29.822
Why ask me?

32:30.823 --> 32:33.201
I'm the one foolish enough
to see if he was all right

32:33.201 --> 32:34.661
after I heard the gunshot.

32:34.869 --> 32:36.621
"It works," he says,
as he's walking down the hall

32:36.621 --> 32:37.705
with a gun in his hand.

32:38.122 --> 32:40.083
Drunk as a skunk.
He's three sheets to the wind.

32:40.083 --> 32:42.502
- That was the night before last?
- Yeah.

32:43.169 --> 32:45.713
Then last night he walks
into the Shamrock, big as life,

32:45.713 --> 32:49.884
being a big shot, telling some woman
on the phone how he robbed a liquor store,

32:50.134 --> 32:52.470
wearing a fake mustache,
and he just came into a lot of money.

32:54.389 --> 32:57.016
He... he saw me.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.728
He knew he nearly put me
into cardiac failure blowing off that gun.

33:01.479 --> 33:02.814
Do you think
that he bought a round for me?

33:04.482 --> 33:07.151
- How tall is this guy, Dwight?
- Six-foot-three.

33:18.871 --> 33:21.290
Till just recently,
I was a tenant here in the building,

33:21.666 --> 33:24.252
but tonight I'm gonna
be speaking to you as a police officer.

33:25.086 --> 33:27.547
About some of the things
that you can do to make yourselves,

33:27.839 --> 33:29.132
and your building more safe.

33:29.757 --> 33:32.218
On the table, I've put some literature,

33:32.218 --> 33:35.888
which talks about the different locks,
and bolts we think are most effective,

33:35.888 --> 33:39.267
and some of the precautions
you can take while entering,

33:39.267 --> 33:41.436
and exiting the common areas
of the building.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.355
Elevators, hallways,
stairs, things like that.

33:44.814 --> 33:48.109
In terms of the unpleasant reality
of actually being accosted,

33:48.317 --> 33:51.404
most of you know that Mr. Goldstein
of apartment four-B,

33:51.863 --> 33:55.199
just recently curtailed the mugging career
of a perpetrator,

33:55.324 --> 33:58.411
who had victimized,
some of the tenants here in the building.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.582
Mr. Goldstein happened
to have a gun on him,

34:02.707 --> 34:05.460
while he was doing his laundry,
and the thief attempted to rob him.

34:05.752 --> 34:08.546
And he used it, and on that occasion,
it worked for him.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.050
But I must tell you
that we don't think it's a good idea.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.802
Our recommendation is, give it up.

34:14.802 --> 34:17.513
Whatever they're looking for
money, jewelry give it up.

34:17.680 --> 34:20.391
Call us, and we'll do our job.

34:20.933 --> 34:24.312
Now, having said that,
having given you those warnings...

34:26.105 --> 34:31.444
I want to say don't live afraid.
Don't hide. Don't be angry.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.321
And don't...

34:33.446 --> 34:35.948
don't go out, and look for vengeance
on those people who break the law.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.451
Those are just other ways
of giving up your freedom,

34:38.451 --> 34:41.412
the same way you would
if you were victimized by violence.

34:41.412 --> 34:43.081
Now...

34:43.081 --> 34:46.084
...it's easy for me
to easy for me to stand here,

34:46.209 --> 34:48.461
and say these things,
and tell you how to live your lives,

34:49.087 --> 34:51.798
tell you not to react to the things
that happen to you.

34:52.381 --> 34:55.176
And I would never
put myself up as an expert

34:55.301 --> 34:57.345
on how to not hold on to things.

34:58.429 --> 35:02.183
My, uh, my dad,

35:02.600 --> 35:06.187
was shot down on the streets.
So, I, uh, I tend to...

35:08.272 --> 35:09.607
tend to be a little bit more careful.

35:10.983 --> 35:14.320
Maybe, uh, a little bit overprotective...

35:21.452 --> 35:24.247
...maybe cramping another person's style.

35:24.622 --> 35:30.002
Anyway, uh, my point is
that, uh, this is your city.

35:31.087 --> 35:34.882
This is your city, not the bad guys.
This is your life.

35:38.511 --> 35:39.679
So be free.

35:41.806 --> 35:46.018
Live it as free as you can,
and, uh, we'll be there for you.

35:47.019 --> 35:50.106
And, uh,
we'll try not to get in your way.

35:53.609 --> 35:54.735
Okay?

35:58.698 --> 35:59.949
- Quit pushing me around.
- Come on!

36:00.158 --> 36:02.827
- I didn't do anything.
- Nah, you didn't do anything.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.830
We didn't find seven traveler's checks
endorsed to that liquor store.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.999
lying on the floor
of your pigsty room, huh?

36:08.207 --> 36:11.294
And this isn't a gun, no, and it doesn't
caliber-match with the piece,

36:11.294 --> 36:13.212
that croaked those people in that store.

36:13.504 --> 36:16.674
And it stinks from being just shot off.
No, but you didn't do anything, huh?

36:17.008 --> 36:20.303
And you didn't puke all over my shoes,
and the bottom of my pants!

36:20.303 --> 36:23.264
- You miserable piece of crap, you!
- Wait a second... wait a second.

36:24.515 --> 36:26.517
Here it comes again!

36:26.642 --> 36:27.935
Here, get him in there.

36:33.566 --> 36:35.693
How bad you gonna make me look on this?

36:36.152 --> 36:38.446
What are you talkin' about?
Don't play with me, Sipowicz

36:38.571 --> 36:40.740
I busted the wrong guy.
You got me by the balls.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.909
Yeah, that's what I'm after.
I want all the credit.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.661
I'm gonna climb over your back.
I'm hoping I can still make chief.

36:47.705 --> 36:50.625
Look... ...you made a wrong ID.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.501
It happens.
Nobody's looking to hurt you.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.588
As far as I'm concerned,
picking up this asshole was your idea.

36:55.713 --> 36:58.090
All right, hey, hey,
you hit my shoes one more time,

36:58.090 --> 36:59.217
I'm gonna fracture your skull.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.223
- Uh, you got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

37:13.648 --> 37:14.774
What was that?

37:15.524 --> 37:18.778
New suspect in that liquor store shooting.
Note his height?

37:19.362 --> 37:22.073
- Note the murder weapon.
- Way to go, Andy.

37:22.073 --> 37:25.993
Yeah, anybody asks,
it was Walker's collar.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.747
Team player that I am.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.375
You going to Hanson's racket tonight?

37:33.334 --> 37:35.044
I'll stick my face in.

37:35.461 --> 37:36.712
No, I'm sorry.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.548
Mrs. Wagner's asked to make a statement.

37:39.548 --> 37:42.385
I want it on the record
that it's against advice of counsel.

37:52.979 --> 37:55.106
I did not plan to kill my husband.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.442
We were extremely unhappy together.

37:58.651 --> 38:01.612
We'd been unhappy for a long time.

38:02.363 --> 38:04.949
And I'd... I'd often, I suppose...

38:05.658 --> 38:07.827
I actually did often wish
that he would die.

38:09.954 --> 38:12.832
I remember seven times in...
...the past few years,

38:12.832 --> 38:15.209
that he beat me with his fists very badly.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.212
And I did frequently wish
that he were dead.

38:19.797 --> 38:22.633
Or that the relationship would be over.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.511
And I did say that I wished he were dead,

38:25.511 --> 38:27.305
and that if I had come home one night,

38:27.305 --> 38:30.599
and found him dead,
that I'd have been glad, relieved.

38:33.060 --> 38:35.980
But in no way was I asking
Detective Kelly to kill him.

38:37.106 --> 38:40.109
Describe the events of the other night
that led to your husband's death.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.908
He came home, and I knew
he was going to beat me

38:47.908 --> 38:50.619
because of the...
...tone of his voice,

38:50.619 --> 38:52.121
and look he had in his eyes.

38:52.788 --> 38:56.542
And... and I was afraid.

39:00.379 --> 39:03.215
The side of my...

39:03.215 --> 39:06.218
...of my face and ear still ached,

39:06.552 --> 39:09.555
and rang from
where he'd hit me the other night.

39:13.017 --> 39:16.228
I went into the bedroom, got the gun,
and told him that he had to leave.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.440
Was it in your mind
at that point to shoot him?

39:19.982 --> 39:21.108
No, it was not.

39:21.692 --> 39:25.529
I wanted him to leave.
I just wanted him to leave me alone.

39:26.197 --> 39:29.283
Just... just didn't want him
to hit me anymore.

39:31.118 --> 39:32.370
Tell me, then what happened?

39:32.870 --> 39:36.165
He started toward me, and I said,
"Please leave. I mean it."

39:38.209 --> 39:41.712
But he never paid
any attention to me, ever...

39:42.755 --> 39:44.715
...in all the years that we were together.

39:45.466 --> 39:48.094
And he came forward,
and I told him to stop.

39:48.302 --> 39:51.055
And I kept backing up,
getting further and further away from him.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.226
And he laughed at me.

39:58.270 --> 40:00.731
He took a step forward, and I shot him.

40:09.865 --> 40:10.908
I'm sorry.

40:13.953 --> 40:14.954
I'm sorry.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.919
- What does that sound like?
- Manslaughter two.

40:21.919 --> 40:23.045
What kind of time?

40:23.671 --> 40:24.922
That would tend
to be the judge's decision.

40:24.922 --> 40:26.757
Yeah, I know, but in terms
of what you would recommend.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.260
A guess? Three years.

40:30.052 --> 40:31.178
Which he might suspend.

40:32.054 --> 40:33.389
Which he might suspend?

40:38.686 --> 40:40.646
That's a pretty soulful look, Detective.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.149
What'd she do to you?

40:43.941 --> 40:45.443
Take a thorn out of your paw?

41:06.797 --> 41:10.092
<i>♪ Babe, I gotta believe ♪</i>

41:10.843 --> 41:13.762
-<i>♪ What you say is true ♪</i>
- Oh, hey.

41:15.222 --> 41:16.223
How's it goin'?

41:16.724 --> 41:20.769
<i>♪ Gotta make it work
Just as hard as you... ♪</i>

41:20.936 --> 41:23.814
Hold that thought.
Hey! Hey, congratulations.

41:24.773 --> 41:25.900
Yeah.

41:26.817 --> 41:27.985
- You made it.
- Yeah.

41:27.985 --> 41:29.111
Come over here.

41:29.445 --> 41:31.822
Uh, no, I just...
I'm just stopping in for a second.

41:32.281 --> 41:33.324
Is Hanson gonna make it?

41:33.324 --> 41:35.117
Yeah, I saw him
checkin' some bus schedules.

41:35.117 --> 41:36.535
I don't think
they mean anything though.

41:38.204 --> 41:41.499
- Hey, look who's here.
- How you doin', Walker?

41:41.957 --> 41:45.669
Fancy gave me the big attaboy
before... For makin' that new collar.

41:46.504 --> 41:49.215
- Is that right?
- I gotta hand it to you, Sipowicz.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.966
- You stood up for me.
- No problem.

41:51.091 --> 41:54.970
- When I'm wrong about somebody, I say so.
- Hey, Walker, no problem. Case closed.

41:55.137 --> 41:58.015
You don't wanna be
a blood brother, huh?

41:58.766 --> 42:01.143
Hey, I'm gettin' more ammo.
Have some. Come on.

42:02.186 --> 42:05.648
- What are you havin'?
- Uh, Club soda.

42:05.773 --> 42:09.652
Leanne, club soda,
and another bourbon, on rocks.

42:09.860 --> 42:10.861
Okay.

42:11.987 --> 42:14.240
- You married?
- Not anymore.

42:14.657 --> 42:17.243
- I've been married 27 years.
- Here you go.

42:17.409 --> 42:18.869
Twenty-six on the force.

42:20.579 --> 42:23.499
- So, you really are off the booze, huh?
- Yeah.

42:24.542 --> 42:27.711
I like to throw a few back.
I like to have a few after five, you know.

42:27.836 --> 42:32.049
Yeah, that's... that's my line
in the sand. Nothing before five.

42:32.758 --> 42:34.009
That's how I stay on top.

42:37.513 --> 42:38.931
Listen,
I'm gonna get out of here.

42:39.598 --> 42:42.434
Hey, uh, what's it like?

42:43.352 --> 42:46.897
- What do you mean?
- You know, uh, gettin' off booze.

42:48.023 --> 42:51.402
I got shot. I was unconscious.
I don't recommend the approach.

42:51.652 --> 42:54.363
- You go to those meetings?
- No.

42:54.655 --> 42:56.365
I'm doing it by the seat of my pants.

42:57.074 --> 42:59.493
I don't feel like I'm, uh,
qualified to give advice.

42:59.743 --> 43:01.245
Hey, hey, hey, look,
I don't need any advice.

43:01.245 --> 43:05.082
I figure, I stick with my line
in the sand, I'll probably be okay.

43:08.586 --> 43:09.837
You want a ride or something?

43:09.837 --> 43:12.381
Ooh, uh,
I don't need any rides.

43:12.965 --> 43:15.968
I always drive twice as careful
after I had a few.

43:18.470 --> 43:20.222
- I'll see you, then.
- Yeah, see you.

43:20.806 --> 43:21.932
What are you doin'?
You gonna stick around?

43:21.932 --> 43:24.018
- Nah, I'm... I'm gonna take off.
- All right.

43:24.018 --> 43:25.561
- Have a good time. Yeah.
- I'll talk to you later.

43:25.561 --> 43:27.062
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

43:27.813 --> 43:30.608
Kelly. He's okay, your partner.

43:35.362 --> 43:36.530
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:44.204 --> 43:45.205
Hey.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.378
It's a free country, right?

43:52.087 --> 43:53.130
Yeah.

43:56.050 --> 44:00.971
I, uh, heard how you went
out of your way for that society woman.

44:02.222 --> 44:04.683
Yeah, well, I didn't do it
'cause she's a society woman.

44:04.933 --> 44:06.310
All I'm saying

44:06.935 --> 44:09.438
is that you knew
she didn't plan to do what she did...

44:10.689 --> 44:12.733
and found it in your heart
to try and understand.

44:16.612 --> 44:18.530
Did she have to confess
before you could forgive her?

44:18.530 --> 44:20.616
- You've had too much to drink.
- Yeah.

44:20.991 --> 44:24.453
And I'm only on my second one.
I am such an easy date.

44:25.913 --> 44:29.583
I think you better give me my rights.

44:30.292 --> 44:31.627
I don't know what you're talking about.

44:32.711 --> 44:34.088
I killed Marino, and his driver.

44:34.213 --> 44:35.631
- I don't want to hear this from you.
- I'm confessing.

44:35.631 --> 44:37.299
I don't want to hear this from you.

44:37.299 --> 44:38.425
- I'm in your hands.
- Did you hear what I said?

44:38.425 --> 44:41.178
I killed them and I think that in time
you will forgive me.

44:43.305 --> 44:44.390
Here you go.

44:49.395 --> 44:52.272
Detective John Kelly?
You got a phone call.

45:08.706 --> 45:10.874
- How is he?
- He's shot in the stomach.

45:10.874 --> 45:12.418
They're trying to get
an operating room.

45:14.294 --> 45:17.297
- What's happening?
- Mr. Goldstein was on the D train.

45:17.297 --> 45:20.050
And, uh, there's this kid
holding up a 46-year-old lady.

45:20.217 --> 45:23.178
Goldstein's got this target gun,
tries to stop the kid.

45:23.470 --> 45:26.098
Kid's got a gun too,
pops Goldstein twice in the belly.

45:26.098 --> 45:27.433
- They catch anybody?
- No.

45:27.558 --> 45:28.892
- Got two good descriptions though.
- All right.

45:34.398 --> 45:36.275
Hey. 4B.

45:37.192 --> 45:41.905
Detective Kelly.
Detective Kelly, I... I got shot.

45:42.197 --> 45:44.324
- Take it easy.
- I'm losin' blood.

45:44.783 --> 45:47.745
I'm losing blood
in the peritoneum, the doctor said.

45:47.870 --> 45:49.288
Just calm down, Mr. Goldstein.

46:43.717 --> 46:46.386
I'm sorry. He's gone.

46:56.605 --> 46:57.648
Poor Josh.

47:00.192 --> 47:01.193
I know.

47:05.531 --> 47:06.824
I gotta call his parents.

47:08.992 --> 47:11.411
I don't know their names.
They live somewhere outside of Cleveland.

47:12.412 --> 47:13.997
Jack, and Frieda Goldstein.

47:16.792 --> 47:17.835
How do you know?

47:18.502 --> 47:19.586
He told me.

47:21.672 --> 47:24.424
Jack, and Frieda Goldstein
of Shaker Heights, Ohio.
