How do you save
someone from a downer?

42:03.390 --> 42:05.523
Give him an upper.

42:05.566 --> 42:08.308
So his drug game is
alive and well?
Oh, yeah.

42:10.571 --> 42:14.183
Bode, listen to me.[exhales softly]

42:14.227 --> 42:18.144
You cannot get dragged
into this.

42:18.187 --> 42:19.406
You're almost
out of here.

42:19.449 --> 42:21.364
30 days, Bode, 30.

42:21.408 --> 42:22.975
Everything
you've worked for.

42:23.018 --> 42:25.368
Everything that
we've worked for.

42:25.412 --> 42:27.806
You were wrong before, man.

42:27.849 --> 42:29.372
We are still
in the same boat,

42:29.416 --> 42:30.678
you and me.

42:32.332 --> 42:35.770
I'm not jumping ship until
we shut down Sleeper together.

42:35.814 --> 42:38.730
We're out here trying
to reduce our time.

42:38.773 --> 42:40.906
I'm not gonna let Sleeper
add to it.

42:40.949 --> 42:43.604
Or ruin our chance at
parole, at redemption.

42:43.648 --> 42:45.606
Not mine
and not yours either.

42:48.087 --> 42:49.436
Freddy, you have my word.

42:51.438 --> 42:52.657
Anything.

42:54.136 --> 42:56.138
I think I would've
taken you.

42:56.182 --> 42:59.185
[laughing]You were close.
You were close.
