00:01.035 --> 00:03.871
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Snowfall.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.309
ANDRE:
Now, this rock
that you're selling--

00:08.342 --> 00:10.444
it's got a special hold.

00:10.478 --> 00:13.514
How you sleeping at night, son?

00:13.547 --> 00:16.817
Like a baby.

00:16.850 --> 00:20.154
ANDRE:
Something's happening
in my neighborhood.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.455
There's more money
on the streets.

00:21.489 --> 00:22.690
-(gunshot)
-More shootings.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.957
-Ha.
-Oh!

00:23.991 --> 00:25.859
ANDRE: Something's changing
in a big way.

00:25.893 --> 00:28.362
-It's called "rock."
-What are you suggesting?

00:29.663 --> 00:30.931
TEDDY:
I haven't stopped thinking

00:30.964 --> 00:33.033
about you guys.
I want us to be together.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.002
JULIA:
I'm not gonna spend
the next ten years

00:35.035 --> 00:37.505
of my life hanging my heart

00:37.538 --> 00:40.374
and my son's heart
on your operation.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.310
DEA! Hands up!

00:42.343 --> 00:44.078
TONY:
We've been instructed
to shut down

00:44.112 --> 00:45.646
every facet of this operation.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.981
LORENA:
I think Teddy's gonna reroute

00:48.015 --> 00:50.084
the coke through Lucia's farm.

00:50.118 --> 00:53.121
So I'm finally
gonna get those fuckers.

00:53.154 --> 00:56.524
I quit the agency
and I joined Reed.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.991
So I'm your contact now.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.262
Get used to it.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.087
(door opens)

01:37.731 --> 01:39.967
You fucked up, amigo.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.238
You fucked up.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.743
You should thank us, cabrÃ³n.

01:54.582 --> 01:58.118
She couldn't be trusted.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.321
In the end,
she would have turned on us.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.726
MARIELA:
Your cocaine. Every brick.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.964
Our money, guero.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.769
We did what you ask.

02:18.306 --> 02:22.075
I never asked you
to shoot my associate.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.318
GUSTAVO:
No, compadre.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.253
No.

02:32.286 --> 02:36.490
You killed her when you sent her
and didn't warn me.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.863
You don't understand.
This isn't...

02:42.896 --> 02:45.199
one of your East L.A. homies,
right?

02:45.233 --> 02:48.236
The DEA is gonna be
looking for her.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.637
MARIELA:
Make sure they

02:49.670 --> 02:52.806
never find her, that's it.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.987
So, um,

03:07.020 --> 03:09.857
you'll come with me,
help me dispose

03:09.890 --> 03:12.059
of the body,
and when we're done,

03:12.092 --> 03:13.761
you'll get your money.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.763
No.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.699
Not my problem.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.670
You want my land,

03:22.703 --> 03:24.605
my routes?

03:24.638 --> 03:25.739
Pay me.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.609
I'm going home.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.548
Do we understand each other?

03:40.788 --> 03:42.656
Yeah.

04:11.018 --> 04:13.020
It's beautiful, Franklin.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.455
(chuckles)

04:14.488 --> 04:18.025
It's just... You can't just
up and disappear like that.

04:18.058 --> 04:21.261
I didn't even know where I was
going till I was on the plane.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.864
You know how crazy that sounds?

04:23.897 --> 04:26.600
I'm playing
a different game now, Mama.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.302
Yeah, what's that?

04:30.371 --> 04:33.206
Kind that moves as you play.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.746
Yeah, well...

04:38.779 --> 04:41.248
while you were
out there playing,

04:41.281 --> 04:44.885
-we lost the property.
-What? How?

04:44.918 --> 04:47.388
Someone came in with another
offer, blew us out the water.

04:47.421 --> 04:50.924
-And you couldn't counter?
-(scoffs)

04:50.958 --> 04:52.760
Like, I don't know,
forge my signature.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.464
I would never do that.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.433
But more to the point,
this was a decision

04:59.467 --> 05:03.103
that I wasn't comfortable
making alone.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.507
We did a lot of work
to find that property.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.776
It's not one we wanted to lose.

05:32.533 --> 05:35.369
GUSTAVO:
We making menudito?

05:38.338 --> 05:41.008
-It's a Mexican stew.
-No, I know what menudo is.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.043
We're not making menudo.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.682
I'm joking, guey.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.351
Pinche menudo was my favorite.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.189
Mi jefa would make it
for New Year.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.992
I was the little one,
so I never got enough.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.995
Por eso on my birthday,

06:02.029 --> 06:04.364
she used to make one
just for me.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.001
Not sure what I find
more surprising...

06:10.037 --> 06:12.540
...that you were the smallest
one in your family,

06:12.573 --> 06:16.209
or that you're choosing now
to tell me about it.

06:16.243 --> 06:19.046
What are we gonna do with her?

06:23.717 --> 06:26.720
Start digging.

06:26.754 --> 06:30.824
Long enough for her body
and two feet deep.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.059
(speaks Spanish)

06:48.275 --> 06:50.911
Yeah, Avi, man,

06:50.944 --> 06:52.345
he's a slippery
motherfucker, you know?

06:52.379 --> 06:53.581
LEON:
Hmm.

06:53.614 --> 06:57.184
Next time,
you're coming with me.

06:57.217 --> 07:00.754
This hotel, the girls
at the pool...

07:00.788 --> 07:02.355
shit was crazy.

07:02.389 --> 07:04.925
Hey, man, just call up that Jew,
I'm ready to go anytime.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.794
(chuckles)

07:06.827 --> 07:08.762
I heard about Wanda.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.798
Yeah.

07:12.466 --> 07:14.635
That's how Drew found out
about the truck,

07:14.668 --> 07:17.237
the projects, the rock.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.541
He lied to us.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.576
-I should've killed both of 'em.
-Mm-mm.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.814
Manboy-- he gonna be
helpful to us.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.249
He gonna move weight.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.652
He'll keep a layer
between us and them cops.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.987
That's important.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.291
Was thinking tonight, though,

07:38.325 --> 07:40.894
maybe me and you could kick it,
if you want.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.196
What you had in mind?

07:44.264 --> 07:47.367
(laughs)

07:47.400 --> 07:49.436
-Eat up.
-Hell yeah.

07:49.469 --> 07:53.574
Entry is front and rear together
with second team,

07:53.607 --> 07:55.776
and I want five
flanking the perimeter.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.645
Your men ready to roll,
Sergeant?

07:57.678 --> 07:59.112
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.581
All right, everyone's clear
on their role

08:00.614 --> 08:01.982
so there's no excuse for anybody

08:02.015 --> 08:05.653
tripping over each other.
Don't forget, these thugs

08:05.686 --> 08:08.455
do not care about you one bit.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.490
You do whatever you need to do
to keep yourself

08:10.524 --> 08:11.659
and the man next to you safe.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.627
All right.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.529
(claps)
Let's go. Hook 'em and book 'em.

08:15.563 --> 08:18.532
ALL:
Yes, sir.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.508
("Searching" by Infatuation
playing)

08:34.514 --> 08:36.850
-Hey, you ain't been here
in a minute.
-Mm-hmm.

08:45.092 --> 08:48.395
Hey, you best go get you
some skates, man.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.530
-Yeah.
-(laughs)

08:50.564 --> 08:53.400
* I'm in love with the girl... *

08:53.433 --> 08:56.770
-What's good?
-Hey.

08:56.804 --> 09:00.073
-Ten and a halves, please.
-Sorry.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.109
-11s work, too.
-Afraid not.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.543
Come on, you ain't even check.

09:05.813 --> 09:08.649
You know, I really do want to
take you out before you leave.

09:08.682 --> 09:12.019
-Why, Franklin?
-What you mean why?

09:12.052 --> 09:14.021
I mean, what's the point?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.990
The point is...

09:17.024 --> 09:19.727
I'm gonna miss you.

09:19.760 --> 09:23.263
Miss you right now,
you ain't even left yet.

09:23.296 --> 09:24.665
You ain't gonna be happy

09:24.698 --> 09:26.199
till you get both of us killed,
are you?

09:26.233 --> 09:28.669
* Haven't you heard? *

09:28.702 --> 09:32.640
Look... what's between
me and your pops

09:32.673 --> 09:34.742
is between us.

09:34.775 --> 09:35.976
What's between me and you...

09:36.009 --> 09:38.946
that's something else.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.215
-WOMAN: Come on.
-MAN: Come on, bruh.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.885
-You backing up my line.
-What?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.920
-For real?
-Come on.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.991
Come skate with me after,

09:51.024 --> 09:52.592
when you get a break, okay?

09:52.626 --> 09:54.061
We'll see.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.730
(mocking):
We'll see.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.032
(chuckles)

09:59.066 --> 10:01.068
(grunting)

10:21.655 --> 10:23.657
(sniffs) Gun.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.627
(breathing heavy)

10:32.365 --> 10:34.968
I didn't kill her
for lying to us.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.605
Or trying to arrest us.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.607
(exhales)

10:40.640 --> 10:42.075
I guess I killed her for...

10:42.109 --> 10:44.144
pretending to love us.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.779
(exhales)

11:05.532 --> 11:07.300
All right.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.636
There's another pair in the bag.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.307
And turn off the tank.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.414
The water and lye...

11:21.448 --> 11:24.617
dissolved at 300 degrees
Fahrenheit creates

11:24.651 --> 11:28.221
a solution that
will dissolve a human body...

11:31.224 --> 11:33.994
in just under three hours.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.338
Careful, careful, just...

11:45.372 --> 11:46.940
You ready?

11:46.974 --> 11:48.976
Grab that end.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.778
Lift.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.345
Okay.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.047
Real slow. Let's go.

11:57.184 --> 11:59.152
(Teddy panting)

11:59.186 --> 12:01.688
You ready?

12:01.721 --> 12:03.991
Tip it.

12:04.024 --> 12:07.060
Okay, walk, walk, walk.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.595
Walk.

12:08.628 --> 12:09.696
(grunting):
Okay.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.065
-Okay, okay.
-(sizzling)

12:12.099 --> 12:14.701
(coughing)

12:14.734 --> 12:17.437
(both coughing)

12:17.470 --> 12:19.372
(spits, sniffles)

12:19.406 --> 12:21.241
(exhales, grunts)

12:23.276 --> 12:25.245
(Teddy exhales sharply)

12:25.278 --> 12:28.181
(panting)

12:28.215 --> 12:31.084
There anything else I need
to know about this drug run?

12:42.562 --> 12:46.900
So, next time I send somebody
to work with you...

12:46.934 --> 12:49.469
they will come back alive?

12:53.974 --> 12:55.442
Okay.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.477
Let's clean this shit up
and go home.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.512
(ragged coughing)

12:59.546 --> 13:01.481
(Teddy sighs)

13:01.514 --> 13:04.284
(Teddy exhales sharply)

13:04.317 --> 13:07.787
* When I hear music,
it makes me dance *

13:07.821 --> 13:11.658
* You got the music,
here's my chance *

13:11.691 --> 13:13.360
* When I hear music *

13:13.393 --> 13:15.728
* It makes me dance *

13:15.762 --> 13:17.164
* You've got the music *

13:17.197 --> 13:19.867
* Here's my chance *

13:19.900 --> 13:21.101
-* Went to the disco *
-Come on.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.370
* Couldn't believe my eyes *

13:23.403 --> 13:25.338
* I looked on the dance floor *

13:25.372 --> 13:26.739
* And saw so many guys *

13:26.773 --> 13:28.041
* I asked myself *

13:28.075 --> 13:30.643
* Could this really be? *

13:30.677 --> 13:32.980
* Whether it is or not *

13:33.013 --> 13:34.647
* I'm going to see... *

13:34.681 --> 13:36.183
Aw...

13:36.216 --> 13:37.584
look at you, all sad.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.486
Playing video games by yourself.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.721
Apparently, ain't no skates
for me, so...

13:41.754 --> 13:44.491
* When I hear music *

13:44.524 --> 13:45.959
* It makes me dance... *

13:45.993 --> 13:48.295
I don't really want
to skate alone.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.363
Oh, what about Eva and Lee?

13:52.532 --> 13:55.535
Skate's got four wheels...
not three.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.270
(chuckles)

13:57.304 --> 13:59.672
Come on, Mel.

13:59.706 --> 14:02.075
You really gonna make me beg?

14:02.109 --> 14:04.544
*

14:04.577 --> 14:06.446
-No.
-(Franklin chuckles)

14:06.479 --> 14:09.249
(cheering)

14:12.852 --> 14:14.521
MELODY:
If you fall, I'm just gonna let
you fall to the floor, okay?

14:14.554 --> 14:15.989
FRANKLIN:
I don't need to watch nothing.
I'm a natural.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.025
MELODY:
All right, show me what you got.

14:21.828 --> 14:25.332
Mel, can I get the keys
to the break room?

14:25.365 --> 14:27.634
-Be quick.
-(Leon laughs)

14:27.667 --> 14:29.836
Yeah, right.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.771
-All right, you ready?
-Yeah, where we going?

14:31.804 --> 14:34.807
This way.
Balance, mind your balance.

14:34.841 --> 14:36.509
(stammers)
It doesn't matter.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.544
(both laugh)

14:37.577 --> 14:38.811
-Ah!
-See?

14:38.845 --> 14:40.847
-Moving too fast.
-Uh-huh.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.515
All right, come on,
come figure this out.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.850
All right.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.352
Shit, you're just
pulling me along.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.320
Yeah. All right,
so what you're gonna do...

14:47.354 --> 14:48.922
-Uh-huh?
-Keep your head up,

14:48.956 --> 14:50.457
'cause if you look down,
that's where you're gonna go.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.458
-Okay.
-Bend your knees a little.

14:51.491 --> 14:52.425
-Like this?
-No.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.327
-(laughs) You stupid.
-(chuckles)

14:54.361 --> 14:56.563
Mind your balance.
Bend your knees,

14:56.596 --> 14:58.565
keep your top up straight, okay?

14:58.598 --> 15:00.233
You're a good teacher.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.835
You're a bad student,
but we're gonna get it together.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.571
Ooh, this is my song.

15:04.604 --> 15:05.838
(singing along):
* The answers... *

15:05.872 --> 15:07.774
MELODY:
Wow.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.376
* You told me to take *

15:09.409 --> 15:10.643
(laughs)

15:10.677 --> 15:11.878
* The chance *

15:11.911 --> 15:14.414
-* And learn the ways *
-Oh, wow.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.749
* Of love *

15:16.783 --> 15:17.917
(laughing)

15:17.951 --> 15:19.752
* And all that it has... *

15:19.786 --> 15:21.754
You're stupid.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.356
What?

15:23.390 --> 15:24.824
* In time you will see... *

15:24.857 --> 15:26.793
You're beautiful.

15:26.826 --> 15:29.296
Whatever, Franklin.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.766
For real.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.635
* You said that *

15:35.668 --> 15:38.705
* You loved me *

15:38.738 --> 15:43.043
* Said hurt only came
to pass me *

15:43.076 --> 15:47.314
* It sounded so convincing *

15:48.948 --> 15:53.553
* That I gave it
half a chance. *

15:53.586 --> 15:54.954
("Teen Machine Rap"

15:54.988 --> 15:56.789
See, there's,
there's Han Solo niggas

15:56.823 --> 15:59.292
and there's
Luke Skywalker niggas.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.428
Han Solo niggas,
they don't believe in shit.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.963
Just about what's
right in front of them.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.598
You know what I'm saying,
2Ton? All business.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.867
Now, Luke Skywalker niggas,

16:07.900 --> 16:10.003
they believe in the force.

16:10.037 --> 16:12.405
You know? (sniffs)

16:12.439 --> 16:14.974
-In the higher powers.
-2TON: So which one is you?

16:15.008 --> 16:16.576
* Teen Machine is in the house *

16:16.609 --> 16:17.877
* Check it out, y'all... *

16:17.910 --> 16:19.946
I'm a little bit of both.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.250
-That's why I'm so special.
-Nah, nigga, you're Chewbacca.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.425
Damn.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.261
* Never be the same again *

16:34.294 --> 16:36.896
* I keep forgettin' *

16:36.929 --> 16:38.931

that so clear... *

16:40.367 --> 16:43.436
* I keep forgettin' how *

Okay.

-Shut the fuck up.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.006
-(door crashes)
-(yelps)
-Shit. Fuck this.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.708
-Check that room.
-Yes, sir.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.676
-(Louie panting)
-Hope you can read, Mr. T.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.079
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.980
Fuck your goddamn fucking
warrant, man.

17:28.014 --> 17:28.981
-(yelping)
-Where's your stash,

17:29.015 --> 17:30.517
-brother?
-Fuck your stash.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.951
Up your mama pussy.

17:31.984 --> 17:33.386
-My mama's pussy?
-Yeah, boy.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.654
That's funny shit.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.789
Smash everything!
Break it all!

JEROME:
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?!

17:40.893 --> 17:41.861
That's fucking illegal!

17:41.894 --> 17:44.030
(overlapping shouting)

17:44.063 --> 17:45.532
Get off of me!

17:45.565 --> 17:48.034
-Get your hands off...
-(grunting)

17:48.067 --> 17:50.770
(overlapping shouting)

-(choking)

17:55.542 --> 17:57.744
No, stop! Stop!

17:57.777 --> 17:59.712
-(choking)
-Let me go!

17:59.746 --> 18:02.081
(fading, echoing):
No, stop!

18:02.115 --> 18:04.751
Stop! Let him go!

18:04.784 --> 18:06.719
Let him go!

18:06.753 --> 18:08.555
(sobbing):
Stop!

18:08.588 --> 18:10.022
No!

18:10.056 --> 18:11.391
(gasps) Fuck you!

18:11.424 --> 18:14.327
-(Jerome grunts)
-Stop... (yelps)

(overlapping shouting)

18:17.029 --> 18:19.766
Stop! Stop!

18:19.799 --> 18:21.768
-Get off of him!
-(shushing)

18:21.801 --> 18:23.069
Get off of him!

18:23.102 --> 18:24.604
-Stop that, you'll kill...
-(blows landing)

18:24.637 --> 18:26.239
Jerome! Stop!

18:26.273 --> 18:28.241
(blows landing, Louie screaming)

18:28.275 --> 18:30.277
(screams fade)

18:35.715 --> 18:37.550
Sure you're the girl
I grew up with?

18:37.584 --> 18:38.918
Hmm?

18:38.951 --> 18:40.353
Stop.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.155
-And no, I'm not.
-(knock on door)

18:42.189 --> 18:44.457
Oh, shit. Get dressed, fool.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.993
Pull up your pants.
One second.

18:47.026 --> 18:48.295
You good?

18:48.328 --> 18:50.029
-Uh-huh.
-(door opens)

18:50.062 --> 18:52.699
Mmm, what y'all two doing?
Mm-hmm.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.301
Y'all scared the shit out of us.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.102
(chuckles) Hey.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.904
-(sighs)
-Oh, this is nice.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.407
-Shon-Shon, you holding?
-(keys jingle)

19:00.440 --> 19:02.575
And I want props...

19:02.609 --> 19:05.312
-Yeah.
-...for not doing it
all without you.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.081
Let's see here.

19:09.115 --> 19:11.451
-Hey.
-What?

19:11.484 --> 19:12.919
(sniffs)

19:12.952 --> 19:14.887
(coughs, sniffles)

19:14.921 --> 19:17.056
-Here you go.
-(pager beeping)

19:19.091 --> 19:21.828
(pagers beeping)

19:23.029 --> 19:24.764
(sniffs)

19:24.797 --> 19:26.733
(snorts)

19:35.342 --> 19:36.709
Frank.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.011
(Franklin groans, exhales)

19:39.045 --> 19:40.513
You okay?

19:40.547 --> 19:43.483
-Yeah. How's Jerome?
-He weren't in with you?

19:43.516 --> 19:46.185
Man, the cops--
they beat him up real bad.

19:46.219 --> 19:47.820
Took him out on a stretcher.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.121
LEON:
Those motherfuckers, man.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.023
They forget to mention that?

19:51.057 --> 19:53.192
-Or did you fuck up?
-This is how they play the game.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.727
Lose paperwork,
move people around,

19:54.761 --> 19:57.530
withhold as much as possible.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.901
FRANKLIN:
All right. I want everybody out.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.637
Finding my uncle?
That's your number one priority.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.639
With those injuries,
he'll likely either be

20:06.673 --> 20:10.042
at White Memorial
or the jail ward at County.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.479
You all should go home
and get some rest.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.881
I'll let you know
when we get something.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.427
(sniffles)

20:29.762 --> 20:31.564
Hey.

20:31.598 --> 20:35.001
You know, you can get out
of here if you cooperate.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.669
Your slate will be wiped clean.

20:36.703 --> 20:39.839
Like I said, Mr. Occifer, I...

20:39.872 --> 20:42.241
I don't know what in the hell
you're talking about. I...

20:42.275 --> 20:44.411
I was over there
visiting my play auntie.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.746
Visiting or eating her?

20:46.779 --> 20:48.515
-(scoffs)
-(whistles)

20:48.548 --> 20:49.916
Fat motherfucker.

20:49.949 --> 20:53.653
Y'all a cute couple, nigga.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.689
ANDRE:
How the hell did this end up
in my neighborhood?

20:56.723 --> 20:59.626
I don't know, but these busts...

20:59.659 --> 21:03.195
Shit,
all this international in town,

21:03.229 --> 21:06.032
-the chief's gonna cream
his dress blues.
-(chuckles)

21:06.065 --> 21:10.870
Oh, I got to say, man.
I don't know how you do it,

21:10.903 --> 21:12.805
living out in the jungle
with those animals.

21:12.839 --> 21:16.242
Thank God you're one
of the good ones.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.078
Good job today.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.548
(door opens, closes)

21:21.581 --> 21:22.749
FRANKLIN:
No.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.150
No, no, that's great.

21:24.183 --> 21:26.218
Thank you.

21:27.820 --> 21:31.257
-Everybody finally out.
-Anything on Jerome?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.926
-You get everything you need?
-This should be fine.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.962
Nice meeting y'all.

21:38.365 --> 21:40.066
(door opens)

21:40.099 --> 21:41.934
-(door closes)
-So how bad is it?

21:41.968 --> 21:43.970
Everything,
from possession with intent

21:44.003 --> 21:46.439
to resisting arrest to weapons.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.775
-At least ain't nobody talking.
-Hmm.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.177
You know, they couldn't charge
the minors at all.

21:51.210 --> 21:54.280
Might be smart,
using more going forward.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.650
(scoffs) You need to be thinking
about how you gonna handle Andre

21:57.684 --> 21:59.819
before you be talking
about moving forward.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.788
-That motherfucker
was here, Franklin.
-(phone ringing)

22:04.824 --> 22:06.626
Hello.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.828
(panting):
Okay.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.597
Thank God.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.198
Mm-hmm.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.903
No, no. Okay,
I'll be there soon. Okay.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.905
Um, County USC.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.408
-He all right?
-Uh, they ain't saying.

22:21.441 --> 22:25.378
They, they want to hold him
24 more hours for observation.

22:25.412 --> 22:27.313
LEON:
Well, did they say if he awake?

22:27.346 --> 22:30.750
Prentice said I might be able
to see him, so...

22:30.783 --> 22:32.585
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold up. We'll drive.

22:32.619 --> 22:35.154
No. You want to do something
for me, you clean this shit up.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.189
I don't want Jerome
coming home to this.

22:37.223 --> 22:40.159
(door opens)

22:40.192 --> 22:41.994
(door closes)

22:42.028 --> 22:44.196
Maybe Louie got a point.

22:44.230 --> 22:46.032
Could be good
to put the brakes on this shit

22:46.065 --> 22:47.700
until we figure out
how to deal with Andre.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.773
(papers shuffling)

22:55.975 --> 22:58.878
Sorry.

22:58.911 --> 23:01.113
I didn't mean to wake you.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.716
(clears throat)

23:06.653 --> 23:08.588
(grunts)

23:08.621 --> 23:11.190
What time is it?

23:11.223 --> 23:13.225
It's almost 2:00.

23:15.261 --> 23:17.730
-Are you okay?
-(sniffles)

23:17.764 --> 23:19.365
Mm.

23:19.398 --> 23:24.403
I think maybe I caught a bug
down there or something.

23:25.672 --> 23:27.640
Hmm.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.745
Is there any way you'd consider
staying on a little longer?

23:32.779 --> 23:35.782
I don't think
that's a good idea.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.285
Well, you know the op.

23:39.318 --> 23:43.055
And you're better
at logistics than I am.

23:43.089 --> 23:46.258
I'm pretty sure the...
suits in D.C.

23:46.292 --> 23:49.261
would be more than thrilled

23:49.295 --> 23:54.066
to know that you were still here
keeping an eye on me.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.069
You know it's more complicated
than that.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.071
Paul could come.

23:59.105 --> 24:02.274
-Uh-uh.
-He could stay with your parents
a little longer.

24:02.308 --> 24:05.645
We'll hire help, then he'll come
out here. We'll all be together.

24:15.688 --> 24:18.658
You think bringing our child

24:18.691 --> 24:20.860
into the middle of this is safe?

24:22.629 --> 24:26.265
I can keep you both clear of
the more dangerous parts of it.

24:30.637 --> 24:33.806
I know that was meant to be
thoughtful, but honestly...

24:33.840 --> 24:38.244
(chuckling): I mean, it just
sounded patronizing as hell.

24:38.277 --> 24:41.681
Uh, I mean...

24:44.651 --> 24:47.620
-(grunts)
-You know, my brother
wasn't the first person

24:47.654 --> 24:49.656
to get hurt on this op.

24:51.758 --> 24:54.126
But I wouldn't be asking you
this if I didn't know

24:54.160 --> 24:56.596
that I could keep you both safe.

25:01.801 --> 25:04.604
And I know
you're not happy in D.C.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.807
Stuck behind a desk.

25:09.842 --> 25:13.279
You telling me you didn't
have fun in Costa Rica?

25:13.312 --> 25:17.449
A little bit of fun, in the
field, just the two of us?

25:19.485 --> 25:22.121
All I'm saying is,

25:22.154 --> 25:26.125
what if we could get
all that back?

25:26.158 --> 25:29.361
And live the life
we always wanted?

25:42.642 --> 25:44.644
(engine stops)

25:46.979 --> 25:48.948
(siren wailing in distance)

26:11.370 --> 26:13.372
No.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.356
(sniffles)

26:45.337 --> 26:47.339
(chuckles softly)

27:20.072 --> 27:22.474
ANDRE:
Remember, feet set.

27:25.577 --> 27:28.447
Keep your sight lined up.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.649
Watch your breathing.

27:40.626 --> 27:41.994
(gunfire nearby)

27:42.028 --> 27:43.796
Not bad.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.031
(whirring)

27:49.235 --> 27:53.272
I heard about last night.

27:53.305 --> 27:56.909
Eva said there was a raid
in the projects.

27:56.943 --> 27:59.145
Few other busts.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.981
And apparently
Jerome got beat up pretty bad.

28:02.014 --> 28:05.617
Well, you know,
it's unfortunate, but he, uh,

28:05.651 --> 28:08.454
he assaulted an officer.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.690
So you were there.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.562
Did you try and stop it?

28:20.199 --> 28:21.734
Daddy, I thought you became
a police officer

28:21.768 --> 28:23.770
to protect our people.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.006
(sighs)

28:27.039 --> 28:28.841
Part of protecting our people

28:28.875 --> 28:30.877
means keeping the neighborhood
as safe as it can be.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.611
By putting Jerome
in the hospital?

28:32.644 --> 28:34.413
Look, uh...

28:35.647 --> 28:39.218
I know you and Franklin
are close,

28:39.251 --> 28:43.389
and that there's nothing
I can do about it.

28:43.422 --> 28:46.525
But he and his family chose
the wrong side of the line...

28:48.928 --> 28:54.000
...and bad things happen
to bad people, Mel.

28:54.033 --> 28:57.603
That's just how it is.

28:57.636 --> 29:01.473
(whispers):
Squeeze. Push, pull.

29:06.512 --> 29:09.982
FRANKLIN:
By now, y'all know we got
into some trouble last night.

29:10.016 --> 29:12.451
Them damn pigs, huh?

29:12.484 --> 29:14.453
-OTHERS: Fuck the police.
-Fuck the police, man.

29:14.486 --> 29:18.490
Came at us with everything
they had, but here we all are.

29:18.524 --> 29:21.427
All y'all out, got the best
lawyers money can buy,

29:21.460 --> 29:24.030
and you gave them cops exactly
jack shit, and that's good.

29:24.063 --> 29:26.032
That's smart.
It's how we survive.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.034
But we gonna have some changes.

29:28.067 --> 29:31.370
We gonna get more lookouts,
more runners,

29:31.403 --> 29:34.373
and we gonna rotate 'em
so the faces don't get familiar.

29:34.406 --> 29:37.977
But above all things,
we gonna make sure

29:38.010 --> 29:41.780
that y'all are protected,
always.

29:41.814 --> 29:45.952
I tell you all the time,
we always got your backs

29:45.985 --> 29:49.288
long as you do what's right.

29:49.321 --> 29:52.358
But there is one thing
we need to discuss,

29:52.391 --> 29:53.759
and that's the cookhouse.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.463
Cops never should've found it.

29:57.496 --> 30:00.599
Anybody got any idea

30:00.632 --> 30:03.802
as to how
that might've happened?

30:03.836 --> 30:05.838
Huh?

30:08.140 --> 30:10.109
Come on, man.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.811
Y'all weren't blasting
any music?

30:12.845 --> 30:14.813
Going in and out the front door?

30:14.847 --> 30:17.083
Maybe bringing the occasional
female around to smoke,

30:17.116 --> 30:19.751
-kill some time?
-Nah, man.

30:19.785 --> 30:21.520
No?

30:21.553 --> 30:24.756
We was quiet as church mice.

30:24.790 --> 30:26.025
I mean, we was just doing

30:26.058 --> 30:28.160
-what you all wanted.
-Hmm.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.996
Man, y'all must've fucked up.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.131
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.133
Shit. Good. Proud of you.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.636
Y'all motherfuckers
think we stupid?

30:37.669 --> 30:39.671
-No!
-Huh?

30:39.705 --> 30:41.740
We don't know
every fucking thing y'all do?

30:41.773 --> 30:43.575
Y'all do good,

30:43.609 --> 30:46.645
and we'll take care
of you, always,

30:46.678 --> 30:49.348
but you fuck up...

30:49.381 --> 30:51.850
(gunshot)

31:38.897 --> 31:41.767
AUTOMATED MALE VOICE:
Sunday, 12:07 p.m.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.569
(answering machine beeps)

31:43.602 --> 31:45.904
WOMAN:
Hi, sweetie, it's Mom.
I'm just calling

31:45.938 --> 31:48.340
to see if there's a chance
you'd be able to make it back

31:48.374 --> 31:50.442
next week
for your dad's birthday.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.111
He would be so surprised.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.545
I-I know you're busy.

31:53.579 --> 31:54.813
No worries
if you can't make it.

31:54.846 --> 31:55.814
No pressure.

31:55.847 --> 31:57.016
I love you.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.884
Te amo. Okay, bye.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.387
(answering machine beeps)

32:05.924 --> 32:07.926
(sighs)

32:29.381 --> 32:31.383
*

32:43.429 --> 32:44.930
-(boy laughs)
-Adios, amor.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.566
(woman speaks Spanish)

32:47.599 --> 32:49.601
(boy and woman speak Spanish)

33:05.151 --> 33:07.486
SPORTS ANNOUNCER:
Tied ball game here
in the top of the sixth inning.

33:07.519 --> 33:09.055
One out, one on.

33:09.088 --> 33:12.491
(continues indistinctly)

33:25.037 --> 33:27.373
I heard you were dead.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.010
You?

33:41.287 --> 33:43.355
What do you want, Gustavo?

33:51.530 --> 33:54.400
Have you heard what they're
saying about you?

33:56.001 --> 33:58.270
I can't be seen with you, vato.

33:58.304 --> 34:00.839
I know.

34:08.013 --> 34:09.715
(chuckles)

34:47.286 --> 34:50.021
Easy, cabrÃ³n.

34:50.055 --> 34:52.558
You don't think I know
when I'm being set up?

35:39.171 --> 35:41.173
What the fuck is in San Diego?

35:44.743 --> 35:46.512
I'm all right.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.580
Goddamn it.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.951
Still think we should
take him to Cedars.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.321
Give him the best help
so he can recover properly.

35:55.354 --> 35:56.955
Ain't going to no
goddamn hospital.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.957
Only medicine I need--
bonded and fortified.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.960
Nigga, get the fuck off me.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.499
Nephew.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.378
FATBACK:
Come on, get better, man.

36:23.048 --> 36:25.050
LOUIE:
You got it, baby.

36:37.629 --> 36:39.698
I know how this feels,

36:39.731 --> 36:43.168
how bad you must want
to get back, but...

36:46.004 --> 36:48.507
...you can't kill no cop.

36:51.209 --> 36:55.381
Not like we didn't have those
discussions during the Panthers,

36:55.414 --> 36:57.416
more than once.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.787
And I'm not making
a moral judgment,

37:01.820 --> 37:03.822
neighbor or no.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.627
I'm talking practicalities.

37:08.660 --> 37:12.230
I'm talking about the hell

37:12.264 --> 37:15.901
that will be rained down
upon black folks

37:15.934 --> 37:17.936
if that happens.

37:32.618 --> 37:34.553
I hear you.

37:41.059 --> 37:43.061
(door opens)

37:44.062 --> 37:46.064
(door closes)

37:54.840 --> 37:56.842
How's Jerome?

37:58.143 --> 38:00.779
Not so good, Mel.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.518
I'm sorry.

38:10.322 --> 38:12.023
It's okay.

38:12.057 --> 38:14.726
You're not the person in your
family that need to be sorry.

38:18.897 --> 38:21.600
Listen, I'm telling you this

38:21.633 --> 38:23.234
because I care about you

38:23.268 --> 38:26.071
and your family.

38:26.104 --> 38:27.473
Mm-hmm.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.408
You got to stop.

38:31.443 --> 38:33.712
-What?
-These are the police, Franklin.

38:33.745 --> 38:35.113
They know everything
you're doing.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.815
Oh, yeah? Why aren't we in jail?

38:36.848 --> 38:39.451
Why my uncle crib destroyed?
Him beaten half to death?

38:39.485 --> 38:40.686
Because he hit a cop, Franklin.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.388
Because they was fucking
with Louie.

38:42.421 --> 38:43.922
-(door opens)
-While your dad watched.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.624
-LOUIE: You better get her
off my property.
-CISSY: Louie.

38:45.657 --> 38:46.892
-Louie, come on, baby.
-Fuck this bitch...

38:46.925 --> 38:48.093
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

38:48.126 --> 38:50.061
Hold on.
Sweetie, come on, come on.

38:50.095 --> 38:52.398
-I got her. Okay.
-LOUIE: You better get.

38:52.431 --> 38:55.434
-Okay, okay.
-Get your girl.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.068
(door closes)

38:57.102 --> 39:00.639
Listen, I ain't saying
they was right...

39:00.672 --> 39:02.408
but y'all are provoking them.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.643
You ain't giving them no choice.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.077
Franklin, please, just listen...

39:06.111 --> 39:08.680
Get the fuck out of here
before I call her back.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.025
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

41:02.160 --> 41:03.829
Never get too greedy, Franklin.

41:03.862 --> 41:06.498
The minute you do that,
you lost your advantage.

41:10.602 --> 41:13.905
From here on out,
we'll only deal
with high-level customers.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.909
-You having trust issues?
-No way.

41:20.145 --> 41:23.114
It's up to you
to protect everyone.
Can you do it or not?

41:25.416 --> 41:27.318
How are you sleeping at night?

41:27.352 --> 41:28.687
Like a baby.
