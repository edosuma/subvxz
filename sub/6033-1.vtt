02:21.314 --> 02:24.579
"Siegfried dealt the king a mortal blow.

02:27.621 --> 02:32.149
"The sword drew blood from the wounds
and King Lindegast was saddened.

02:32.225 --> 02:36.093
"He begged Siegfried to let him live
and offered him his lance."

03:12.332 --> 03:13.560
Bastian?

03:19.306 --> 03:20.170
God!

03:24.678 --> 03:25.667
Bastian!

03:26.780 --> 03:27.747
Hi, Dad.

03:36.256 --> 03:37.621
Out of the pool, kids.

03:38.692 --> 03:40.353
Stop horsing around.

03:50.036 --> 03:52.027
Everybody, line up!

03:53.306 --> 03:56.275
- Who wants to make the team?
- Me!

03:56.343 --> 03:58.971
Good. Let's see who's got what it takes.

03:59.546 --> 04:02.913
We're going to start with the high board.

04:07.821 --> 04:09.083
Billy, go!

04:13.760 --> 04:15.057
Bastian...

04:15.562 --> 04:16.824
...you're next.

04:17.764 --> 04:18.992
Go!

05:03.810 --> 05:06.404
Bastian, go for it!

05:07.113 --> 05:08.978
You can do it!

05:12.619 --> 05:14.018
What's the matter?

05:16.890 --> 05:18.152
I got a cramp.

05:20.594 --> 05:22.027
High wimp factor.

05:25.632 --> 05:26.860
Sorry, coach.

05:38.345 --> 05:39.573
How did it go?

05:41.348 --> 05:42.940
Did you make the swim team?

05:47.087 --> 05:47.951
No.

05:50.156 --> 05:51.418
What happened?

05:54.261 --> 05:55.558
I didn't jump.

05:58.164 --> 05:59.358
Why not?

06:03.870 --> 06:05.167
I guess I...

06:05.272 --> 06:06.569
...had a cramp.

06:15.415 --> 06:16.746
Going out tonight?

06:16.816 --> 06:19.785
Yeah. Technical sales staff seminar.

06:19.886 --> 06:22.252
Is Ms. Station Wagon picking you up?

06:23.256 --> 06:24.746
Why do you say that?

06:27.560 --> 06:28.686
The tie.

06:30.697 --> 06:31.595
Yeah.

06:32.899 --> 06:36.130
Dressing is common courtesy, Bastian.

06:36.636 --> 06:39.298
Something you must learn.
Look at that rag you're wearing.

06:41.241 --> 06:43.402
- I like it.
- Well, I don't.

06:47.981 --> 06:49.141
Mom made it!

06:54.054 --> 06:55.681
You don't remember, do you?

07:07.500 --> 07:08.592
I've gotta go.

09:03.416 --> 09:04.678
Mr. Koreander?

09:07.053 --> 09:09.544
Well, it's been a while.

09:11.224 --> 09:14.193
- I dropped in to say hi.
- Hi.

09:21.901 --> 09:23.562
Do you carry "How-to" books?

09:23.636 --> 09:25.103
"How-to" books?

09:25.672 --> 09:28.140
Does this place look like a supermarket?

09:28.808 --> 09:31.368
If you want advice on buying real estate...

09:31.878 --> 09:34.073
...or housebreaking your goldfish...

09:34.247 --> 09:36.715
...go to the video store down the street.

09:39.486 --> 09:41.215
What is it you want to know?

09:42.489 --> 09:44.184
Something about heights.

09:45.758 --> 09:48.022
How to be able to jump from a high...

09:49.829 --> 09:51.194
...a very high...

09:52.365 --> 09:54.162
...an extremely high diving board.

09:54.601 --> 09:56.535
I'll look in my section on...

09:57.203 --> 09:58.431
...courage.

10:20.660 --> 10:22.127
Bastian.

10:24.063 --> 10:25.655
We need your help.

10:28.268 --> 10:29.428
Help us.

10:33.873 --> 10:36.933
Please come back, Bastian.

10:43.149 --> 10:44.844
"The Neverending Story."

11:00.667 --> 11:02.134
Put it back!

11:04.170 --> 11:06.502
That book asks too much of you.

11:06.573 --> 11:09.007
But it's The Neverending Story.
I've already read it.

11:09.108 --> 11:11.474
But have you ever read a book twice?

11:12.178 --> 11:14.806
Books change each time you read them.

11:15.081 --> 11:17.606
- Give it back.
- I really want to read it again.

11:17.684 --> 11:20.278
No, no. Look what I found for you.

11:20.420 --> 11:21.978
Let me borrow it, please!

11:22.055 --> 11:23.386
No, Bastian!

12:24.550 --> 12:25.448
Auryn.

12:47.340 --> 12:48.773
Bastian.

12:49.976 --> 12:51.944
We need your help.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.441
Come back to Fantasia.

12:59.285 --> 13:01.776
We are in great danger.

13:33.019 --> 13:34.179
Fantasia!

13:54.307 --> 13:58.300
An Earthling to save the Childlike Empress!

13:59.879 --> 14:00.868
Nimbly!

14:02.949 --> 14:04.780
Enter, my spy.

14:08.087 --> 14:11.079
Mistress of Horok Castle,
I came as fast as I...

14:31.244 --> 14:34.270
- You were saying?
- I could gain the boy's confidence.

14:34.347 --> 14:38.306
I don't care about his confidence.
I want his wishes.

14:38.951 --> 14:40.316
Tri Face!

14:50.630 --> 14:54.964
The Memory Machine.
Explain it to him, Tri Face.

14:55.234 --> 14:57.065
Yes, explain it!

15:00.173 --> 15:03.108
Every time the Earthling
uses Auryn to make a wish...

15:03.176 --> 15:05.736
...my new invention
makes him lose a memory!

15:06.145 --> 15:09.808
With each wish,
the liquid in his head forms a memory ball.

15:09.949 --> 15:11.814
It falls down and is collected...

15:11.884 --> 15:13.374
...in the beaker below.

15:13.586 --> 15:16.384
What happens when he has lost
all of his memories?

15:16.489 --> 15:19.686
Obviously, the beaker at the bottom is full.

15:20.827 --> 15:23.159
And the Earthling's head is empty.

15:23.930 --> 15:26.228
He won't remember where he came from.

15:27.266 --> 15:29.291
He won't remember his own world.

15:30.269 --> 15:33.932
But best of all,
he will have forgotten his mission:

15:34.073 --> 15:36.564
Why he came to Fantasia.

15:36.943 --> 15:39.207
He will forget the Childlike Empress.

15:41.347 --> 15:46.148
That's when I'll bring order to the chaos
they call dreams and stories.

15:48.554 --> 15:49.782
Nimbly, go!

15:50.189 --> 15:51.952
Make the Earthling wish.

15:56.863 --> 15:58.091
Are you okay?

15:59.298 --> 16:01.289
Fine. I'm fine.

16:01.801 --> 16:03.291
My best landing yet.

16:03.870 --> 16:05.929
Looks like you just got your wings.

16:06.005 --> 16:07.836
No, I've always had them.

16:09.208 --> 16:10.698
I'm Bastian.

16:11.544 --> 16:14.240
Nimbly's the name, tour guide's the game!

16:14.714 --> 16:17.182
Let me show you the sights of Silver City!

16:21.854 --> 16:23.082
Watch out!

16:23.856 --> 16:25.118
Pure acid!

16:26.993 --> 16:27.960
Acid?

16:35.401 --> 16:38.666
Fantasians will be grateful
if you wish for the lake to be filled...

16:38.738 --> 16:41.002
...with crystal spring water instead.

16:42.008 --> 16:43.873
What do you mean, if I would wish?

16:47.346 --> 16:48.711
You have Auryn.

16:49.181 --> 16:51.308
It fulfills all of your wishes.

16:53.185 --> 16:55.847
Too bad only one of these exists.

16:55.922 --> 16:58.390
You want something. You wish it.

16:59.225 --> 17:01.056
Auryn makes it happen.

17:01.427 --> 17:02.951
You're very lucky.

17:04.195 --> 17:06.357
Come on! Try it out.

17:07.032 --> 17:10.366
Start with the lake. Make it purple.

17:10.970 --> 17:12.403
Add some sugar.

17:12.637 --> 17:16.368
Raise the temperature
so we can go swimming.

17:16.675 --> 17:20.373
I don't know.
I'm sure there's a reason for the acid.

17:21.614 --> 17:23.638
Maybe it keeps everything shiny.

17:25.483 --> 17:27.816
I wouldn't want to change anything,
it's so pretty.

17:27.887 --> 17:30.219
Come on, make a wish.

17:33.826 --> 17:34.793
Look!

17:43.669 --> 17:44.636
Come on.

18:23.009 --> 18:25.136
Everything seems fine in Fantasia.

18:25.244 --> 18:27.041
Fine and dandy.

18:27.513 --> 18:28.810
Why do you ask?

18:29.315 --> 18:31.510
I have to see the Childlike Empress.

18:31.684 --> 18:33.481
How far is it to the lvory Tower?

18:33.619 --> 18:36.110
You mean, how many ways to get there?

18:36.188 --> 18:38.349
No, I mean in distance.

18:39.191 --> 18:40.522
Yards?

18:40.593 --> 18:41.787
Miles?

18:42.895 --> 18:44.453
Kilometers?

18:44.530 --> 18:47.021
Everything's as close or as far...

18:47.099 --> 18:48.862
...as you want it to be.

19:10.423 --> 19:11.913
Nimbly?

19:23.669 --> 19:26.263
- What are they?
- I didn't have time to ask.

19:26.806 --> 19:29.639
- They look like giants.
- I can see that!

19:35.881 --> 19:37.644
Come back.

19:42.822 --> 19:44.687
Wish for our lives!

20:01.640 --> 20:02.698
Acid!

20:08.047 --> 20:09.776
Hey, silly boy!

20:11.484 --> 20:13.816
Wish them away, for Fantasia's sake!

20:13.953 --> 20:15.716
Wish them away, Bastian!

20:22.461 --> 20:23.723
Nimbly!

20:27.733 --> 20:29.701
Kids! Just wish!

20:50.289 --> 20:52.052
Wish to be safe!

21:07.673 --> 21:09.504
Well done, Bastian!

21:12.211 --> 21:13.200
I'm safe.

21:14.280 --> 21:15.975
You can get out of here.

21:16.582 --> 21:17.742
I made it.

21:21.353 --> 21:22.183
Where'd you go?

21:31.330 --> 21:33.525
Look here. Who is this?

21:33.599 --> 21:35.590
Nice entrance.

21:36.635 --> 21:38.159
It's an Earthling.

21:38.237 --> 21:40.728
Yes, it is an Earthling.

21:42.374 --> 21:45.502
You just taught some Giants
how to swim, Earthling.

21:54.220 --> 21:55.050
Hi.

21:55.554 --> 21:57.021
Hello.

21:59.358 --> 22:01.553
I didn't mean to interrupt anything.

22:02.261 --> 22:07.426
You have come to the Ship of Secret Plots.

22:08.434 --> 22:10.994
"You were called by the Childlike Empress"

22:11.070 --> 22:12.537
Is she all right?

22:13.072 --> 22:15.438
In my world, the Empress is now only...

22:16.575 --> 22:17.769
...an empty page.

22:17.843 --> 22:20.676
We haven't been able to reach her
for a long time.

22:21.046 --> 22:24.743
Those who dared the journey
to the lvory Tower perished.

22:24.917 --> 22:27.215
The very earth is breaking away.

22:27.319 --> 22:30.914
Even us Mudwarts who are made of earth,
can't get there.

22:31.757 --> 22:33.122
"Take courage, friends

22:33.192 --> 22:37.185
"The Earthling has come to help us
We must talk to the Empress"

22:51.777 --> 22:53.210
Childlike Empress.

22:53.545 --> 22:57.777
Bastian, you are the only Earthling
moved by our plight.

22:58.050 --> 22:59.642
What's going on?

23:00.019 --> 23:01.077
Are you hurt?

23:01.153 --> 23:04.554
The same force that makes the books
in your world become empty...

23:04.623 --> 23:06.818
...makes me a prisoner in my castle.

23:06.959 --> 23:08.426
What is this force?

23:08.661 --> 23:10.822
Only you can name it, Bastian.

23:12.431 --> 23:13.227
Name it?

23:13.299 --> 23:15.699
We are the creatures of human fantasies.

23:16.235 --> 23:19.432
We need your dreams and stories to exist.

23:19.505 --> 23:22.668
But the people in your world
no longer believe in us.

23:22.741 --> 23:25.767
They have no time
to give us names and stories.

23:26.412 --> 23:28.073
Tell me what I must do!

23:28.681 --> 23:29.705
There is...

23:30.115 --> 23:31.173
You must resist...

23:31.917 --> 23:34.545
Your answer... Auryn will help you.

23:34.953 --> 23:37.148
But you must remember if you use it...

23:38.424 --> 23:40.984
Only you can save us, Bastian.

23:41.727 --> 23:45.219
Only you can heal both
of our worlds. Bastian!

23:46.098 --> 23:47.588
You are my last hope.

23:59.712 --> 24:02.374
We must get everyone in Fantasia
to help us.

24:04.550 --> 24:05.517
Now!

24:11.790 --> 24:12.779
Bastian.

24:47.426 --> 24:49.917
K. Koreander - Antique Bookstore

25:00.272 --> 25:02.399
The Empress is being held prisoner.

25:03.175 --> 25:06.008
Before we can fight the force holding her...

25:06.211 --> 25:07.940
...I must give it a name.

25:09.181 --> 25:11.081
Who will join me on my quest?

25:11.350 --> 25:13.511
You saw the Giants, they're everywhere.

25:13.752 --> 25:15.185
You can't hide.

25:15.287 --> 25:18.347
There will be more Giants
who will destroy your beautiful ships!

25:18.757 --> 25:20.054
I'm afraid.

25:20.926 --> 25:22.291
If you give up...

25:22.795 --> 25:25.286
...it's not only the end of Silver City...

25:25.364 --> 25:27.195
...it's the end of Fantasia.

25:27.866 --> 25:29.128
Do you know what that means?

25:29.201 --> 25:32.261
The children of my world
will have no more stories to read.

25:32.337 --> 25:33.304
Ever.

25:33.939 --> 25:37.466
Is there no one with the courage
to stand up with me against the Giants?

25:43.615 --> 25:44.411
Atreyu!

25:54.560 --> 25:55.549
Atreyu!

25:56.328 --> 25:57.317
Bastian!

25:58.030 --> 25:59.463
Welcome back.

26:00.399 --> 26:01.525
How did you...

26:01.600 --> 26:06.094
In my dreams I saw a light over Silver City
and I knew there was hope.

26:06.305 --> 26:08.330
But I did not expect to find you.

26:08.407 --> 26:09.840
Were you in danger?

26:09.908 --> 26:12.308
- Did you see the Giants?
- Where do they come from?

26:12.377 --> 26:14.902
People talk about a castle
shaped like a hand.

26:14.980 --> 26:17.039
Some say that's where
the Giants come from.

26:17.115 --> 26:18.480
That's where we should go.

26:18.550 --> 26:21.041
There are burning arrows of light
all around it.

26:24.890 --> 26:27.586
Do you know of a castle
that looks like a hand?

26:27.826 --> 26:31.387
You mean Horok Castle, the Seeing Hand?
Sure!

26:31.830 --> 26:33.161
Do you know how to get there?

26:33.332 --> 26:36.665
There are no roads. You'll have to fly.

26:37.102 --> 26:40.663
But a little wish would go a long way.

26:40.739 --> 26:41.706
A wish?

26:42.074 --> 26:43.666
Nimbly's right. I have Auryn.

26:43.942 --> 26:46.274
- I should use it.
- When I'm right, I'm right.

26:47.446 --> 26:48.606
I'll try it.

26:50.115 --> 26:51.639
I need something...

26:52.851 --> 26:54.341
...something that...

26:56.321 --> 26:57.686
...can fly...

26:58.190 --> 27:01.751
...and that can scare the pants off
anything living in that castle.

27:02.194 --> 27:03.661
Very sensible.

27:03.729 --> 27:07.256
I'll wish for the most horrible flying dragon
in the history of Fantasia!

27:10.802 --> 27:13.100
I wish him to be red. No, green.

27:14.139 --> 27:17.040
I wish him to fly as fast as the Concorde
and stinks so bad...

27:17.109 --> 27:18.633
...that he makes you sick!

27:19.378 --> 27:20.640
And breathes fire.

27:24.550 --> 27:26.415
I'll call him Smerg.

27:27.719 --> 27:30.449
Maybe you should wish
for some modifications.

27:31.089 --> 27:32.215
Oh, no!

27:33.225 --> 27:34.522
Oh, yes!

27:48.874 --> 27:52.105
We can't let it loose on Fantasia.
Who knows what it might do.

27:52.578 --> 27:54.842
- What are you going to do?
- Chase it!

27:57.616 --> 27:58.605
Chase?

27:59.518 --> 28:01.884
Did somebody say "chase"?

28:03.021 --> 28:04.079
Falkor!

28:04.156 --> 28:06.147
Boy, am I glad to see you!

28:06.658 --> 28:08.990
And I'm glad to see you.

28:09.194 --> 28:10.923
What are we waiting for?

28:11.330 --> 28:13.992
I've got an itch behind my ear.

29:17.329 --> 29:19.058
Go for it, Falkor!

29:38.784 --> 29:41.981
Look! The castle that looks like a hand.

29:43.021 --> 29:45.251
A very mean hand.

29:48.393 --> 29:49.883
Hold on.

30:00.572 --> 30:01.903
Smerg got zapped.

30:03.008 --> 30:04.737
We got to find Atreyu.

30:05.077 --> 30:07.136
I got to get some rest.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.177
Hey!

30:11.149 --> 30:13.913
Watch it, folks!

30:13.985 --> 30:15.179
Rockbiter!

30:28.567 --> 30:29.795
Rockbiter!

30:34.106 --> 30:37.166
You'll wake him up.

30:45.183 --> 30:47.617
Meet Junior.

30:48.587 --> 30:51.351
Is this yum-yum rockie?

30:51.423 --> 30:53.823
Let me try.

31:26.391 --> 31:27.619
Junior...

31:28.293 --> 31:31.626
...when are you going to learn...

31:31.730 --> 31:35.131
...the difference between a rock...

31:36.535 --> 31:38.264
...and a nose?

31:43.809 --> 31:45.333
Why was Junior crying?

31:45.410 --> 31:48.004
He's hungry.

31:48.480 --> 31:49.504
Hungry?

31:49.581 --> 31:51.412
With all these rocks around?

31:51.650 --> 31:55.211
I don't understand it...

31:55.420 --> 31:57.217
...myself...

31:57.989 --> 31:59.752
...but all...

31:59.825 --> 32:04.922
...goodness has gone out of the rocks.

32:04.996 --> 32:07.328
They're hollow.

32:07.999 --> 32:10.399
Whole mountains...

32:10.569 --> 32:12.901
...have turned empty.

32:14.372 --> 32:17.034
There's nothing left...

32:17.642 --> 32:19.974
...to nourish us.

32:22.514 --> 32:24.505
It's all part of the same thing.

32:33.859 --> 32:37.351
You're fighting a losing battle,
Childlike Empress.

32:38.396 --> 32:41.160
Soon your slick little castle...

32:41.233 --> 32:44.259
...will be as dark as mine.

33:21.239 --> 33:23.173
I didn't break the window!

33:23.541 --> 33:24.633
Don't lie to me!

33:26.578 --> 33:30.070
You promised to take me swimming.
You promised.

33:30.248 --> 33:31.545
Something's come up.

33:31.616 --> 33:33.140
I hate you! I hate you!

33:38.256 --> 33:40.281
So that's what humans remember.

33:46.998 --> 33:49.091
That's a memory Bastian has lost!

34:07.285 --> 34:08.377
Excuse me.

34:12.389 --> 34:13.982
What can I do for you?

34:14.159 --> 34:16.992
Do you know Bastian? Bastian Bux?

34:18.630 --> 34:21.292
Do we ever really know anybody?

34:22.634 --> 34:25.467
I'm Bastian's father. Barney.

34:26.137 --> 34:28.833
I found this book in my son's room.

34:28.907 --> 34:30.806
Your address is inside the cover.

34:31.309 --> 34:32.275
Really?

34:34.579 --> 34:35.545
Where?

34:38.449 --> 34:39.917
I don't understand.

34:40.418 --> 34:42.147
I saw it there last night.

34:50.261 --> 34:51.853
Look, I'm an engineer.

34:52.664 --> 34:55.063
What I see is what I see when I see it.

34:56.266 --> 34:58.098
It's an interesting concept.

34:59.471 --> 35:01.598
My son's missing since last night.

35:03.942 --> 35:05.876
Heavy reading for a young man.

35:07.345 --> 35:09.074
When did you last see him?

35:10.348 --> 35:13.715
Maybe you'll find the explanation
for his disappearance...

35:14.419 --> 35:15.545
...inside.

35:41.212 --> 35:43.043
We were getting worried about you.

35:44.049 --> 35:45.448
Where have you been?

35:45.884 --> 35:48.717
I convinced some warriors
to help us take the castle.

35:52.357 --> 35:53.585
Warriors?

35:56.661 --> 35:57.992
Where are they?

36:00.331 --> 36:01.662
Right here.

36:03.668 --> 36:05.499
Atreyu, get real!

36:07.338 --> 36:08.600
But I am real!

36:09.140 --> 36:11.040
What do you mean, "get real"?

36:11.142 --> 36:13.133
Forget it. It's a joke.

36:14.679 --> 36:16.874
Being real is a joke in your world?

36:18.416 --> 36:19.405
Yeah!

36:22.754 --> 36:24.153
What's in the bag?

36:24.489 --> 36:25.513
Our army.

36:59.924 --> 37:01.016
Come here.

37:02.393 --> 37:05.055
Never mind. You'll grow into it.

37:06.931 --> 37:08.296
And so will you.

37:13.938 --> 37:16.736
The machine's working out well, isn't it?

37:17.308 --> 37:21.369
It would work better if you were out there
making the Earthling wish.

37:23.481 --> 37:25.108
It's so cold out there.

37:40.565 --> 37:41.930
That's the plan.

37:44.469 --> 37:47.597
It's dangerous, but it just might work.

37:49.240 --> 37:50.537
It has to work.

37:53.077 --> 37:55.238
I'm glad you came back to Fantasia.

37:58.383 --> 37:59.441
I am, too.

38:01.386 --> 38:03.786
What if something happens to you?

38:04.889 --> 38:09.155
Somebody must miss you in your world.

38:12.597 --> 38:13.723
Nobody misses me.

38:13.798 --> 38:15.493
But what about you?

38:16.634 --> 38:18.329
Don't you miss somebody?

38:25.610 --> 38:27.202
The only one I miss...

38:30.148 --> 38:31.445
...isn't there.

38:32.083 --> 38:33.243
Who's that?

38:38.223 --> 38:39.190
My mom.

38:41.659 --> 38:43.286
Look.

38:45.230 --> 38:48.393
The lvory Tower.

39:00.445 --> 39:03.107
Now it's a prison.

39:03.448 --> 39:05.348
We may never see the Empress again.

39:05.416 --> 39:06.713
Right now...

39:07.719 --> 39:10.244
...all we have are memories.

39:11.689 --> 39:13.316
Bastian.

39:14.359 --> 39:16.520
In your world...

39:17.795 --> 39:20.889
...if The Neverending Story...

39:21.065 --> 39:22.464
...is fading...

39:24.002 --> 39:27.062
...no child will ever know...

39:27.839 --> 39:29.807
...about Junior.

39:30.775 --> 39:33.744
They'll never ride the prairie with me?

39:33.811 --> 39:37.042
They'll never ride
through the clouds with me?

39:39.384 --> 39:41.181
If humans...

39:41.653 --> 39:44.121
...forget about us...

39:44.622 --> 39:47.386
...nobody will think...

39:47.458 --> 39:49.619
...of fun things...

39:50.628 --> 39:53.688
...for Junior to do.

39:54.732 --> 39:55.699
No!

40:12.016 --> 40:13.745
We won't let that happen.

40:41.579 --> 40:43.206
Bastian, here!

40:51.189 --> 40:53.783
Atreyu, quick, help me!

40:55.560 --> 40:57.187
I'm burning! It hurts!

40:59.297 --> 41:01.288
I can't breathe!

41:21.419 --> 41:23.080
Are you all right?

41:27.692 --> 41:29.853
You saved my life, Atreyu.

41:30.461 --> 41:34.158
Yes. But you would have done
the same for me.

41:40.738 --> 41:41.898
Sure.

41:44.809 --> 41:46.140
What's happening?

41:46.911 --> 41:50.574
The beams! They've destroyed the beams!

41:51.282 --> 41:52.613
Fix it!

42:04.896 --> 42:06.887
Do you remember what to say?

42:08.266 --> 42:09.255
Yeah.

42:10.034 --> 42:11.865
Make it loud.

42:16.908 --> 42:19.741
The Earthling Bastian Balthazar Bux...

42:19.977 --> 42:21.535
...and Atreyu...

42:22.380 --> 42:24.371
...the warrior from the Great Plains...

42:24.449 --> 42:27.441
Is that what you call loud in your world?

42:33.458 --> 42:36.120
The Earthling Bastian Balthazar Bux...

42:36.227 --> 42:39.492
...and Atreyu,
the warrior from the Great Plains...

42:39.597 --> 42:43.158
...demand to see the master of this castle!

42:43.768 --> 42:46.100
That should get somebody's attention.

42:51.075 --> 42:52.565
Guess whose?

42:57.114 --> 43:00.015
Do they make strong gates in Fantasia?

43:00.284 --> 43:01.945
Keep talking.

43:05.857 --> 43:07.688
Keep talking!

43:26.377 --> 43:27.537
Hi.

43:30.748 --> 43:33.308
You're probably wondering why I'm here.

43:38.055 --> 43:40.216
That's a reasonable question.

43:41.425 --> 43:43.450
In the past we've had our differences...

43:43.528 --> 43:45.792
...but I'm sure they can be worked out.

43:51.602 --> 43:54.264
It all gets back to us
starting to communicate, right?

43:56.474 --> 43:58.635
There's all kinds of communication.

43:58.910 --> 44:00.901
Some do it with a look.

44:01.612 --> 44:03.603
Some do it with a smile.

44:04.549 --> 44:06.278
Some do it with...

44:07.885 --> 44:09.216
...a sickle.

44:11.222 --> 44:14.214
I read that somewhere. I like to read.

44:14.725 --> 44:17.057
You're probably not interested.

44:20.731 --> 44:22.562
You probably hate books.

44:29.140 --> 44:31.802
Eggs? Eggs will do us a lot of good!

44:32.310 --> 44:34.278
Wham-Bos, go!

44:45.957 --> 44:47.356
Now's your chance, go!

44:47.658 --> 44:48.989
What about them?

44:49.060 --> 44:52.393
- It's a good day to die.
- Don't say that!

44:54.532 --> 44:56.864
- Give me five!
- Five what?

44:57.401 --> 44:59.995
Forget it! I'll see you inside.

45:10.615 --> 45:13.015
I wish there was some other way in.

46:10.975 --> 46:13.136
I wish for another step!

46:21.352 --> 46:23.047
And another one.

46:23.120 --> 46:24.451
And another.

46:24.789 --> 46:26.279
And another one.

46:27.391 --> 46:29.723
Nice. Very nice.

46:31.262 --> 46:32.786
Giants!

46:35.733 --> 46:37.394
I wish for another one!

46:39.170 --> 46:40.660
And another!

47:36.761 --> 47:38.456
Atreyu!

47:41.098 --> 47:42.759
Try to swing around.

47:45.770 --> 47:47.761
It won't work.

48:01.352 --> 48:02.785
The chain.

48:04.822 --> 48:06.483
Grab it!

48:22.072 --> 48:23.437
Pull!

48:25.709 --> 48:27.233
Pull!

48:43.427 --> 48:44.917
Come on, pull!

49:19.096 --> 49:20.393
We need weapons!

49:20.464 --> 49:23.956
I wish for a spraycan.

49:24.101 --> 49:26.934
That's a weapon in your world?

49:27.071 --> 49:28.595
People use it against walls.

49:28.672 --> 49:30.833
Those walls must be dangerous.

49:51.862 --> 49:54.194
I don't believe what we have done.

49:54.565 --> 49:55.896
I do.

50:06.677 --> 50:08.668
The Giants are empty.

50:10.247 --> 50:12.238
They're hollow and empty.

50:14.184 --> 50:16.516
Like the Rockbiter's stones...

50:18.789 --> 50:21.451
...and the pages of The Neverending Story.

50:23.127 --> 50:25.721
I know what threatens Fantasia.

50:25.796 --> 50:27.627
You have found its name?

50:28.399 --> 50:32.028
It's the Emptiness.

50:35.839 --> 50:38.000
The Earthling knows about the Emptiness.

50:38.075 --> 50:40.009
He's stronger than we thought.

50:40.577 --> 50:43.239
Perhaps threatening him with Giants
isn't the way.

50:43.514 --> 50:45.675
Time for a change of tactics.

51:05.836 --> 51:08.498
What does the Emptiness look like?

51:10.607 --> 51:12.541
How does it fight?

51:12.810 --> 51:15.142
I think we're about to find out.

51:18.115 --> 51:20.447
I wish for the doors to open!

52:01.592 --> 52:03.423
I am Xayide.

52:04.294 --> 52:06.228
This is my castle.

52:07.164 --> 52:08.461
And the Giants?

52:09.767 --> 52:11.132
They were mine.

52:11.602 --> 52:13.433
But you have conquered them.

52:13.804 --> 52:15.362
I admit defeat.

52:15.439 --> 52:17.100
I have defeated you?

52:17.741 --> 52:18.901
We.

52:20.511 --> 52:23.344
That someone so young could be so clever.

52:24.515 --> 52:26.506
You make everything empty.

52:26.583 --> 52:28.847
I control all that is empty.

52:28.919 --> 52:31.820
Just to control things,
you destroy stories and books?

52:31.889 --> 52:35.222
I'm trying to bring order
to the chaos of Fantasia.

52:35.793 --> 52:36.953
Am I wrong?

52:37.027 --> 52:41.225
You certainly are! I demand that you free
the Childlike Empress!

52:41.298 --> 52:42.959
- I can't.
- Why not?

52:43.233 --> 52:45.360
I've isolated her forever.

52:45.436 --> 52:47.836
You made the spell and you can undo it!

52:48.038 --> 52:49.471
Not from here I can't.

52:49.540 --> 52:51.064
So we'll go to the lvory Tower.

52:51.141 --> 52:53.132
I will not leave my castle.

52:53.343 --> 52:55.607
- You will.
- Out of the question.

52:56.513 --> 52:59.346
Perhaps she feels it's a good day to die.

53:05.089 --> 53:06.784
Do you?

53:09.493 --> 53:12.155
You leave me no choice, my lord.

53:47.931 --> 53:49.262
Bastian?

53:50.234 --> 53:53.397
"As Mr. Koreander searched
for a book on courage...

53:53.537 --> 53:56.438
"...Bastian picked up
The Neverending Story."

53:56.640 --> 53:58.301
Mr. Koreander?

53:58.475 --> 54:01.467
"If the pages ofThe Neverending Story
were fading...

54:01.545 --> 54:04.776
"...no one would read about Falkor,
or Atreyu...

54:04.882 --> 54:06.873
"...or the Childlike Empress.

54:07.417 --> 54:10.352
"Bastian was the only one
who could save Fantasia...

54:10.487 --> 54:12.751
"...and all the stories in the world.

54:13.257 --> 54:16.249
"He had to do it, at any price."

54:17.995 --> 54:20.088
Move it, dummy!

54:27.237 --> 54:28.864
I should say not.

54:29.239 --> 54:33.005
I am not going to carry that woman.

54:35.512 --> 54:38.504
My Xobile will do just fine, gentlemen.

54:47.457 --> 54:49.618
Would you ride with me, my lord?

54:52.129 --> 54:53.289
Sure.

54:54.798 --> 54:56.527
Come, then.

55:04.808 --> 55:06.469
Welcome aboard.

55:06.910 --> 55:08.241
Away!

55:08.378 --> 55:11.040
We cannot leave him alone with her.

55:33.770 --> 55:36.170
There was no "For Sale" sign this morning!

55:39.576 --> 55:42.340
This is one sophisticated operation.

55:42.512 --> 55:46.505
This morning this place was filled
with books, wall to wall!

55:51.855 --> 55:54.949
Looks like there hasn't been
a bookstore here for a long time.

55:56.460 --> 55:58.690
Are you sure it's the right address?

55:59.796 --> 56:02.594
I'm not the type of person
to make things up.

56:03.467 --> 56:06.595
I'm an engineer.
What I see is what I see...

56:09.206 --> 56:11.299
We'll do what we can, Mr. Bux.

56:16.980 --> 56:18.607
Don't you understand?

56:18.749 --> 56:22.617
Atreyu's been jealous of you
since the first day you arrived here.

56:22.719 --> 56:25.347
Why would he feel this way?
He's a great warrior.

56:25.422 --> 56:29.051
Yes, but you have been chosen
to wear Auryn.

56:30.727 --> 56:34.288
You may have to learn that some people
are not as grateful as others.

56:35.198 --> 56:37.166
I want to express my gratitude...

56:37.234 --> 56:39.930
...for the generosity you've shown me.

56:42.205 --> 56:43.695
What is it?

56:43.940 --> 56:46.704
It's a belt that makes its wearer invisible.

56:47.077 --> 56:48.567
Want to try it on?

56:49.980 --> 56:51.208
Okay.

57:11.601 --> 57:13.364
This is weird.

57:13.870 --> 57:15.269
What's the matter?

57:15.672 --> 57:17.663
I can't see myself.

57:18.442 --> 57:20.433
I can't even see the belt.

57:23.280 --> 57:25.180
What ifl can't take it off?

57:25.282 --> 57:26.613
Use a wish.

57:27.818 --> 57:29.479
I don't like this.

57:30.520 --> 57:31.851
I wish...

57:32.622 --> 57:34.783
You wish to be visible again?

57:35.959 --> 57:37.051
Yes.

57:50.207 --> 57:51.765
This is neat.

57:53.577 --> 57:55.568
It may come in handy.

58:36.853 --> 58:38.343
Bastian!

58:39.689 --> 58:41.020
Come here!

58:47.097 --> 58:50.294
Don't be long. You'll catch a cold.

58:50.434 --> 58:52.095
I'll be right back.

58:59.943 --> 59:01.433
What's wrong?

59:01.878 --> 59:04.039
I want to show you something.

59:08.051 --> 59:12.215
Look. Tracks of the Xobile,
footprints of Artax.

59:12.622 --> 59:13.953
What are you saying?

59:14.224 --> 59:16.488
We're going around in circles.

59:16.760 --> 59:19.092
But the countryside has been changing.

59:20.864 --> 59:22.559
It doesn't make sense.

59:23.500 --> 59:27.402
It does to someone who doesn't want us
closer to the lvory Tower.

59:28.371 --> 59:30.396
Xayide says we're nearly there.

59:30.474 --> 59:32.305
Bastian, I'm waiting!

59:32.776 --> 59:34.300
Just a moment.

59:34.911 --> 59:39.575
She's our prisoner, Bastian.
Don't let her order you around.

59:40.550 --> 59:42.541
How can you believe her?

59:42.686 --> 59:46.315
How can we be sure she'll help us free
the Childlike Empress?

59:46.756 --> 59:50.214
- I don't trust her.
- I can tell when someone lies to me.

59:51.361 --> 59:54.194
And I can tell when
someone is up to no good.

59:57.100 --> 01:00:00.160
She's totally under my control.
Don't worry.

01:00:35.305 --> 01:00:37.796
"Bastian's head emptied with every wish.

01:00:37.874 --> 01:00:39.739
"He hardly remembered his father...

01:00:39.809 --> 01:00:43.074
"...who was worried sick
over his son's disappearance."

01:00:44.381 --> 01:00:46.076
I'm in this book?

01:00:51.988 --> 01:00:53.979
"Atreyu was worried too.

01:00:54.524 --> 01:00:57.084
"The journey to the lvory Tower
was going nowhere.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.720
"As he tried once again
to talk sense into Bastian...

01:00:59.796 --> 01:01:02.390
"...he was to learn even more
about Xayide's scheme."

01:01:02.465 --> 01:01:04.092
Show me the coin trick again.

01:01:04.167 --> 01:01:06.158
I've shown you a million times.

01:01:09.139 --> 01:01:12.506
It must be the smoke in here.
It's hard to remember things.

01:01:14.878 --> 01:01:17.540
Why remember things
when you can wish for them?

01:01:19.215 --> 01:01:21.206
What should I wish for?

01:01:21.351 --> 01:01:25.185
What about juggling?
Wouldn't you enjoy that?

01:01:25.855 --> 01:01:27.015
I can't juggle.

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:29.622
If you wish for it you can.

01:01:30.594 --> 01:01:31.925
I wish it.

01:01:51.815 --> 01:01:55.307
"Then the darkness lifted
and she could see her way home.

01:01:55.719 --> 01:01:59.052
"So the princess returned
to her father's castle.

01:02:00.056 --> 01:02:03.048
"And they all lived happily ever after."

01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:16.231
Don't be afraid, Bastian.

01:02:17.574 --> 01:02:21.908
We're all part of a neverending story.

01:02:23.313 --> 01:02:24.473
We are?

01:02:25.982 --> 01:02:27.415
Even if we die?

01:02:28.251 --> 01:02:30.742
Yes, Bastian, we are.

01:02:43.933 --> 01:02:45.764
That's good to know.

01:02:47.504 --> 01:02:49.495
That's good to know.

01:02:54.778 --> 01:02:57.508
From what you tell me...

01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:01.107
...the Emptiness has found its way
into Bastian's head.

01:03:01.451 --> 01:03:03.351
It's Auryn, isn't it?

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.284
It works differently with humans
than with us.

01:03:06.356 --> 01:03:09.189
Because humans need memories.

01:03:12.328 --> 01:03:14.319
So what I saw...

01:03:16.566 --> 01:03:18.227
...was a memory.

01:03:35.685 --> 01:03:39.416
If Bastian's so clever,
why can't he see what's happening?

01:03:39.489 --> 01:03:42.925
Bastian is losing himself with every wish.

01:03:43.326 --> 01:03:46.921
He must be stopped, or Fantasia's lost.

01:03:51.868 --> 01:03:55.634
I'll take Auryn away from him by force,
if necessary.

01:03:57.741 --> 01:04:00.904
He can't be allowed
to make one more wish.

01:04:01.578 --> 01:04:06.015
I'll have to do it tonight.
Tomorrow we might be Xayide's prisoners.

01:04:09.886 --> 01:04:13.822
Don't go to him in anger.
Go and warn him.

01:04:15.024 --> 01:04:17.356
He's your friend, isn't he?

01:04:19.195 --> 01:04:20.423
You're right.

01:04:21.965 --> 01:04:23.557
He is my friend.

01:04:31.875 --> 01:04:34.639
You're right. He has turned against me.

01:04:34.711 --> 01:04:36.702
You need to protect yourself.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.278
There could be Giants to take care of you...

01:04:41.818 --> 01:04:43.308
...if you wish.

01:05:15.952 --> 01:05:17.920
Stand guard!

01:05:24.427 --> 01:05:25.587
Thief!

01:05:25.929 --> 01:05:27.726
- I've come to warn you.
- Liar!

01:05:27.797 --> 01:05:30.630
- Don't you ever say that to me!
- It's true!

01:05:30.834 --> 01:05:34.201
You're jealous that I have Auryn,
and you've come to take it from me.

01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:35.430
I have not!

01:05:35.505 --> 01:05:39.066
I overheard you talking to Falkor,
so don't try and make excuses.

01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:44.603
You've gone mad, Bastian. Give me Auryn.

01:05:44.681 --> 01:05:46.615
She wants me to have it.

01:05:46.683 --> 01:05:50.619
You don't understand anything.
Go back and play with your buffaloes...

01:05:50.687 --> 01:05:51.779
...country boy!

01:05:51.855 --> 01:05:55.382
Why don't you go back and play hero
in your own world, Earthling?

01:06:04.901 --> 01:06:08.894
Every time you use Auryn,
you lose one of your memories.

01:06:09.505 --> 01:06:11.166
Xayide has...

01:06:11.774 --> 01:06:13.742
...a machine that collects them.

01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:15.835
- I would have seen it...
- I have seen it.

01:06:15.912 --> 01:06:18.244
It's in the roof of the Xobile.

01:06:20.817 --> 01:06:24.913
A few more wishes,
and the Emptiness will possess you.

01:06:27.423 --> 01:06:30.722
Give me Auryn before it's too late!

01:06:31.494 --> 01:06:33.325
Take it if you can.

01:07:01.357 --> 01:07:03.552
You brought this on yourself!

01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:25.880
You've only two wishes to go.

01:07:29.018 --> 01:07:30.576
But, my lord...

01:07:34.223 --> 01:07:35.918
I didn't mean it.

01:07:36.793 --> 01:07:37.782
Falkor!

01:07:40.096 --> 01:07:42.257
Atreyu, I'm sorry!

01:07:55.178 --> 01:07:57.237
Take me to Atreyu!

01:07:58.247 --> 01:07:59.407
Giants!

01:08:01.884 --> 01:08:04.079
My son on a horse?

01:08:05.054 --> 01:08:06.316
He can't ride a horse.

01:08:27.542 --> 01:08:28.805
Who told the boy?

01:08:28.978 --> 01:08:32.209
It's Nimbly's fault.
He's always hanging around the machine.

01:08:32.314 --> 01:08:36.216
Thanks for nothing.
It's nice to have someone to count on.

01:08:36.618 --> 01:08:39.179
I do the counting around here.

01:08:39.255 --> 01:08:40.620
It's your fault.

01:08:40.923 --> 01:08:41.617
One...

01:08:46.662 --> 01:08:47.185
...two...

01:08:51.801 --> 01:08:52.529
...three!

01:09:00.877 --> 01:09:03.140
"As he sank beneath the water, he knew...

01:09:03.212 --> 01:09:05.805
"...that as punishment for killing Atreyu...

01:09:06.182 --> 01:09:08.116
"...he would die himself."

01:09:19.127 --> 01:09:22.120
Don't buy it, Bastian. Swim! Fight!

01:09:34.109 --> 01:09:35.270
Yes!

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:39.112
According to the machine,
he has two wishes left.

01:09:39.348 --> 01:09:41.339
There must be something wrong with it.

01:09:41.417 --> 01:09:43.044
It's working perfectly.

01:09:43.152 --> 01:09:46.417
Whatever you tried didn't work.
He didn't make a wish!

01:09:47.290 --> 01:09:48.518
He will.

01:09:56.399 --> 01:09:57.889
It's time.

01:10:06.542 --> 01:10:08.703
Time to choose sides.

01:10:11.614 --> 01:10:13.047
"Xayide and her Giants...

01:10:13.116 --> 01:10:16.142
"...drove into the underworld of Fantasia.

01:10:16.686 --> 01:10:19.120
"Here they could travel
with the speed of darkness...

01:10:19.188 --> 01:10:21.520
"...which was faster
than the speed oflight.

01:10:21.591 --> 01:10:25.493
"They would find Bastian in no time
and force him to make his last wish."

01:10:42.612 --> 01:10:44.136
Go on.

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:45.074
Keep trying.

01:10:48.885 --> 01:10:51.217
Don't forget me, Bastian.

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:54.116
"Possessed by a deep, dreamless sleep...

01:10:54.190 --> 01:10:57.250
"...he couldn't hear
the Childlike Empress's plea."

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:38.699
Mr. Bastian, wait!

01:11:38.768 --> 01:11:40.463
I won't hurt you.

01:11:41.537 --> 01:11:43.402
I've come to help you.

01:11:48.711 --> 01:11:50.645
You don't give up, do you?

01:11:52.215 --> 01:11:54.376
You expect me to believe you?

01:11:54.784 --> 01:11:56.445
Yes, Mr. Bastian.

01:11:56.986 --> 01:11:58.385
You have to.

01:12:02.458 --> 01:12:03.789
I saw...

01:12:06.462 --> 01:12:08.293
...one of your memories.

01:12:13.603 --> 01:12:15.594
It made me feel something.

01:12:22.178 --> 01:12:23.668
I learned...

01:12:25.514 --> 01:12:27.505
...that we're all part...

01:12:28.351 --> 01:12:30.444
...of a neverending story.

01:12:31.287 --> 01:12:33.721
Bastian, try to remember it.

01:12:35.124 --> 01:12:37.183
Unless we stop Xayide...

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.951
...the story will end.

01:12:42.031 --> 01:12:43.692
That's why I'm here.

01:12:43.933 --> 01:12:45.924
Tell me where to find Falkor.

01:12:47.937 --> 01:12:49.564
At the Silver City.

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:53.070
But you won't like what you see.

01:13:04.787 --> 01:13:06.721
How do I get there?

01:13:09.225 --> 01:13:10.783
Behind those rocks...

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:14.523
...you'll find a path through the mountains.

01:13:15.498 --> 01:13:17.056
On the other side...

01:13:17.967 --> 01:13:19.958
...keep the sun on your back.

01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:23.238
Follow your shadow for half a day.

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:28.170
Don't turn 'round.
The Emptiness will be on your heels.

01:13:30.513 --> 01:13:31.912
Come with me.

01:13:37.119 --> 01:13:40.282
I got the part of a spy
in this story, Mr. Bastian.

01:13:42.958 --> 01:13:46.291
And he who spies and flies away...

01:13:47.763 --> 01:13:49.958
...lives to spy another day.

01:13:55.971 --> 01:13:57.802
Hurry, Mr. Bastian!

01:13:57.873 --> 01:14:00.034
Keep the sun on your back!

01:14:04.413 --> 01:14:09.112
"Alone once again, Bastian wandered,
determined to find Falkor.

01:14:10.653 --> 01:14:14.646
"Climbing on a heap ofblack
and metal sheets and pilings...

01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:18.954
"...he hardly recognized
the once proud and famous Silver City."

01:14:44.487 --> 01:14:47.615
I thought we'd never see you again.

01:14:48.858 --> 01:14:50.655
Where have you been?

01:15:09.111 --> 01:15:11.238
I have two wishes left, Falkor.

01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:14.213
Well, if you use those wishes...

01:15:15.284 --> 01:15:19.482
...you will have lost
your most precious memories.

01:15:20.189 --> 01:15:21.520
My mother...

01:15:22.525 --> 01:15:23.856
...and my father.

01:15:29.098 --> 01:15:30.429
My mother...

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:33.293
...would have wanted it this way.

01:15:39.975 --> 01:15:43.411
I wish for nothing more
than for Atreyu to live!

01:16:08.337 --> 01:16:10.168
I'm sorry for what happened.

01:16:12.675 --> 01:16:14.199
Can you forgive me?

01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:19.042
Friends?

01:16:21.484 --> 01:16:22.815
Friends.

01:16:26.689 --> 01:16:28.953
Bastian made a wish, didn't he?

01:16:29.024 --> 01:16:32.619
He gave you a very special memory.

01:16:36.198 --> 01:16:38.359
Your mother would have been proud.

01:16:40.269 --> 01:16:41.759
Who?

01:16:43.005 --> 01:16:45.303
Falkor, you shouldn't have let him.

01:17:04.693 --> 01:17:07.093
You're outnumbered and outdone, Bastian.

01:17:07.563 --> 01:17:09.963
And you have only one wish left.

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:14.563
So use what's left of your brain
and wish to go home.

01:17:14.703 --> 01:17:16.637
That's where you belong.

01:17:16.939 --> 01:17:18.702
If I use my last wish...

01:17:18.841 --> 01:17:20.604
Fantasia will be forgotten.

01:17:20.676 --> 01:17:24.009
The Childlike Empress will be gone forever.

01:17:25.147 --> 01:17:26.580
Go home...

01:17:26.682 --> 01:17:29.014
...and leave Fantasia to me.

01:17:30.686 --> 01:17:33.382
I won't betray the Childlike Empress!

01:17:33.455 --> 01:17:34.683
Very well.

01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:37.725
But how will your father feel
if he never sees you again?

01:17:40.763 --> 01:17:42.253
My father...

01:17:49.705 --> 01:17:51.696
Make your wish.

01:17:52.241 --> 01:17:54.709
Wish to go home.

01:17:56.946 --> 01:18:00.404
Yes, Xayide, I will make my last wish.

01:18:03.185 --> 01:18:04.880
I wish...

01:18:06.422 --> 01:18:08.720
...for you to have a heart.

01:19:54.663 --> 01:19:57.496
You have found the only wish...

01:19:57.566 --> 01:20:00.558
...powerful enough to save us, Bastian.

01:20:00.936 --> 01:20:03.564
The Emptiness cannot be destroyed.

01:20:03.772 --> 01:20:06.434
It had to be filled with love.

01:20:08.444 --> 01:20:09.638
And Auryn?

01:20:09.712 --> 01:20:12.704
It's only a mirror of what's inside you.

01:20:13.015 --> 01:20:15.006
Courage comes from the heart...

01:20:15.084 --> 01:20:16.949
...not from symbols.

01:20:17.886 --> 01:20:21.686
If you've found courage, you can go home...

01:20:22.057 --> 01:20:24.548
...and heal both our worlds.

01:20:26.161 --> 01:20:28.152
I can't go home.

01:20:38.907 --> 01:20:41.034
- That's the way home?
- Yes.

01:20:41.710 --> 01:20:43.701
The only way.

01:20:51.687 --> 01:20:53.678
You found courage.

01:20:55.691 --> 01:20:59.593
Bastian, you have. You've found courage.

01:20:59.695 --> 01:21:02.960
My father. That's his voice.

01:21:03.866 --> 01:21:06.232
Now make a wish from your heart.

01:21:12.441 --> 01:21:14.238
I wish to go home...

01:21:16.245 --> 01:21:17.940
...and tell my dad...

01:21:20.048 --> 01:21:21.538
...that I love him.

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.351
Good luck, Bastian.

01:21:26.889 --> 01:21:28.516
Good luck!

01:21:30.759 --> 01:21:32.852
You can do it, Bastian.

01:22:32.788 --> 01:22:35.882
- I was worried about you.
- I'm sorry.

01:22:37.159 --> 01:22:38.456
You're back.

01:22:41.964 --> 01:22:43.795
You helped me, didn't you?

01:22:43.866 --> 01:22:45.333
You heard me?

01:22:46.134 --> 01:22:47.965
Of course I heard you.

01:22:52.474 --> 01:22:53.805
I love you.

01:22:56.311 --> 01:22:59.508
I love you very, very much.

01:23:08.323 --> 01:23:09.654
I love you too, Dad.
