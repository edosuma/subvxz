upside down.

I am not a tragic orphan.

I actually have
too many brothers.

03:38.735 --> 03:41.151
Four, which is
simply excessive.

Let me interview someone.
I like bands. They're friendly.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.191
To you, my darling,
of course they are.

38:17.225 --> 38:19.642
Talk to Derby about features,
alright?

38:21.368 --> 38:25.786
Sir, I think I'm ready
to take on more responsibilities

38:25.820 --> 38:27.477
and stretch myself.

38:27.512 --> 38:29.168
I very much see part of my job

38:29.203 --> 38:33.518
as helping young women
stretch their responsibilities.

38:34.622 --> 38:37.280
Sit here and tell me
more about it.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.626
Sir?

38:43.528 --> 38:45.633
Sit here?

38:53.883 --> 38:55.160
[laughs]

38:55.194 --> 38:56.955
Watch this. Watch this.

39:00.545 --> 39:03.341
This was a good idea.
This is fun.

39:03.375 --> 39:07.379
Does anyone else want a go?
This is awesome.

39:07.414 --> 39:10.831
I mean, it's not as good as a
chair, like all you guys have

39:10.865 --> 39:12.729
but it's definitely second best.

39:12.764 --> 39:15.145
- Maybe we could wrestle, too.
- No.

39:15.180 --> 39:17.596
No, okay, you've got
the feature, okay?

39:17.631 --> 39:19.667
You can do John Kite in Dublin.

39:21.082 --> 39:23.326
They're my thank-you bounces.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.639
Please make sure your
seat's back and tray tables

39:25.673 --> 39:27.226
are in the full upright
positions

39:27.261 --> 39:30.333
and that your seatbelt
is correctly fastened.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.748
So the gig's at 10:00 p.m.

39:31.783 --> 39:32.991
We'll do the interview first
in the pub.

39:33.025 --> 39:35.649
Are all planes this small?

39:35.683 --> 39:37.167
Here's some clippings
and some photos.

39:37.202 --> 39:38.893
You've heard his new record,
yes?

39:38.928 --> 39:41.344
Is this turbulence?

39:41.379 --> 39:42.863
We haven't taken off yet.

39:44.140 --> 39:46.970
They say flying
is the safest mode of transport

39:47.005 --> 39:49.594
but surely that's walking.

39:51.665 --> 39:53.701
[gasps]

39:55.462 --> 39:59.051
Then after the show, I'll be
with John Kite at all times.

40:01.985 --> 40:04.332
- Oh, God, what's happening?
- Eh?

40:04.367 --> 40:06.300
Well, we've just gone
above the clouds.

40:08.475 --> 40:10.960
[instrumental music]

40:23.800 --> 40:26.009
John, what are you
talking about? Come back to me.

40:26.044 --> 40:27.735
Let's just do it in the pub,
you know.

40:27.770 --> 40:30.186
- Listen..
- John. D-and-ME's here.

40:36.399 --> 40:38.850
[instrumental music]

40:42.370 --> 40:46.754
John. D-and-ME.
This is Dolly Wilde.

40:46.789 --> 40:50.413
Alright, Duchess?
Pleasure to meet you.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.795
Shall we, uh, brutalize
ourselves with gin?

40:52.829 --> 40:55.004
Oh, I would just like some pop,
please.

40:55.038 --> 40:57.144
- Do you want a cigarette?
-No, thank you.

40:57.178 --> 41:00.734
Ah. Well, I applaud
your brightness.

41:02.045 --> 41:04.047
When you start smoking

41:04.082 --> 41:06.464
you think that you've bought
a fun baby dragon.

41:06.498 --> 41:08.500
You think that you've charmed
a fabulous beast

41:08.535 --> 41:10.951
that will impress both your
enemies and your friends.

41:10.985 --> 41:12.400
Then, 20 years later,
you wake up

41:12.435 --> 41:14.195
with your lungs full of cinder,
the bed's on fire

41:14.230 --> 41:16.543
and you realize
the dragon grew up

41:16.577 --> 41:18.648
and burned your
fucking house down.

41:21.271 --> 41:24.482
- So, the interview..
- Ah, the interview.

41:24.516 --> 41:26.622
My first question is, if you
had to murder someone evil

41:26.656 --> 41:28.244
how would you do it?

41:28.278 --> 41:29.935
- That is an amazing question.
- What's your worst song?

41:29.970 --> 41:31.523
- Oh, I don't know.
- Which is the best Beatle?

41:31.558 --> 41:32.835
Well, that's quite a..

41:32.869 --> 41:34.975
What would you spend a pound on
in a sweet shop?

41:37.598 --> 41:39.669
[laughs]

41:39.704 --> 41:43.121
Darling, have you ever done,
like, an interview before?

41:43.155 --> 41:45.364
No. I will be honest with you.

41:45.399 --> 41:47.505
I've never done
on anything before.

41:47.539 --> 41:50.162
I'm quite new. I went on a plane
today for the first time.

41:50.197 --> 41:53.372
- Do you know how amazing it is?
- Tell me.

41:53.407 --> 41:55.720
Today I learned
an astounding thing.

41:55.754 --> 41:57.653
It's always sunny
above the clouds.

41:57.687 --> 41:59.102
However awful it is on Earth

41:59.137 --> 42:02.278
if you go high enough,
it's always summer.

42:02.312 --> 42:03.969
Isn't that amazing?

42:06.558 --> 42:09.527
- Ed, we're finished here, mate.
- I have other questions.

42:09.561 --> 42:11.701
Look, darling, if you think
I'm gonna sit here

42:11.736 --> 42:13.254
bollocking on about me

42:13.289 --> 42:16.948
when you're both mad as Jesus
and new to abroad.

42:16.982 --> 42:19.260
Come on.
We're going out.

42:24.058 --> 42:25.991
Welcome to the world.

42:27.752 --> 42:29.374
James Joyce's favorite pub.

42:29.408 --> 42:31.479

- Yeah, I'm alright, mate.
I'm good, yeah.

Let's get you started..

43:07.654 --> 43:09.000
Same old routine, eh?

43:09.034 --> 43:11.761
You ready? Good.
It's all good.

43:12.693 --> 43:14.212

Hit me.

Why are your songs so sad?

...born in a crossfire
hurricane.

46:21.537 --> 46:23.608
...like you, baby,
I'm a scratcher.

46:23.642 --> 46:25.921
I was born in Blackwood,
South Wales Valleys

46:25.955 --> 46:27.646
in a crossfire drizzle.

46:28.855 --> 46:32.030
My mother had my three sisters

46:32.065 --> 46:34.343
and then she got ill.

46:34.377 --> 46:38.243
We'd go and visit her
in hospital and, uh..

46:38.278 --> 46:41.419
...she, uh,
she didn't wanna touch us.

46:43.973 --> 46:46.079
It made her cry.

46:46.113 --> 46:47.563
And when we'd say goodbye

46:47.597 --> 46:50.738
she'd press the tips of her
fingers to her mouth

46:50.773 --> 46:53.776
press it on our mouths,
and say, "This is John's kiss."

46:56.434 --> 46:59.540
And the little ones, you know,
they just wanted their mum.

47:02.164 --> 47:04.304
When she, uh, decided to die..

47:05.684 --> 47:10.034
...I'd go into her wardrobe
and...put on her coat

47:10.068 --> 47:11.759
and hug 'em..

47:15.349 --> 47:17.282
...so they could smell her,
you know.

47:18.801 --> 47:21.045
I read somewhere
that's what you do with puppies.

47:21.079 --> 47:23.150
You...put 'em in a cardboard box

47:23.185 --> 47:25.566

of their mother.

47:27.637 --> 47:29.156

about you.

Whose eyes do you have?

47:50.833 --> 47:52.386
Whose, whose wonder?

47:53.871 --> 47:57.288
I used to think that anyone
who didn't have my mother...

47:57.322 --> 47:58.668
My eyes are hers.

47:58.703 --> 48:01.637
Or my father,
he's the one who loves the world

48:01.671 --> 48:04.467

just lie down and die.

48:06.193 --> 48:07.608

48:07.643 --> 48:10.542
But then she had
the unexpected twins.

48:13.097 --> 48:15.202
And now she's just..

48:17.825 --> 48:19.241
I miss her.

48:22.244 --> 48:23.831
Even though she's there.

48:25.764 --> 48:28.250
So I guess I write

48:28.284 --> 48:32.116
because that's like..

48:32.150 --> 48:35.533
...putting a wish into a bottle,
isn't it?

48:35.567 --> 48:39.192
Baby, I think we are both
in the business

48:39.226 --> 48:40.848
of putting wishes in bottles.

business we're in.

I've fallen in love with Doors.
They're amazing.

49:27.412 --> 49:30.933
- But do you love dogs?
- What? Do I love dogs?

49:30.968 --> 49:33.211
I absolutely love dogs.

that lead to the dominance of
working-class rock and roll.

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:52.340
only to realize you built
yourself with the wrong things?

01:38:54.169 --> 01:38:56.413
You rip it up and start again.

01:38:56.447 --> 01:38:58.311
Build up and tear down.

01:38:58.346 --> 01:39:00.969
Endlessly, repetitively,
unceasingly.

01:39:01.004 --> 01:39:03.938
Invent, invent, invent.

01:39:03.972 --> 01:39:05.629
What will eventually be you?

01:39:05.663 --> 01:39:08.873
One day, you'll marvel
over what you did.

01:39:08.908 --> 01:39:10.289
Marvel how you tried to keep

01:39:10.323 --> 01:39:12.843
the loud, drunken, laughing

01:39:12.877 --> 01:39:14.396
cutting, panicking

01:39:14.431 --> 01:39:17.744
unbearably present
secret of yourself

01:39:17.779 --> 01:39:20.575
when, really, you were just
about as secret as the moon.

01:39:22.163 --> 01:39:24.648
And as luminous
under all those clothes.

01:39:24.682 --> 01:39:28.548
And how, like all
the best quests

01:39:28.583 --> 01:39:32.242
you did it all for a girl, you.
