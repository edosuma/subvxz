00:02.333 --> 00:03.589
<i>Previously on "Nashville"...</i>

00:03.753 --> 00:05.893
Rayna, I want you to meet Juliette Barnes.

00:06.134 --> 00:07.713
An arena tour with Juliette.

00:07.884 --> 00:09.625
I cannot believe we have to do this.

00:09.926 --> 00:11.923
(Bucky) Scarlett, you just got
yourself a record deal. (Screams)

00:12.890 --> 00:15.271
Now you're moving in with my
woman? You didn't deserve her.

00:15.462 --> 00:16.678
Will you marry me?

00:16.929 --> 00:18.766
I love you. That is the truth.

00:20.041 --> 00:21.417
I'm pregnant.

00:21.887 --> 00:24.024
You're demoting me? I quit.

00:25.448 --> 00:26.724
Go. Just get out.

00:26.872 --> 00:28.409
(Juliette) My mother is a drug addict.

00:28.565 --> 00:30.459
Mama? No! (Sobbing)

00:30.624 --> 00:32.360
(Voice breaks) I think
that you might be my father.

00:32.610 --> 00:34.309
Stop it. (Shouts indistinctly)

00:34.491 --> 00:35.267
(Tires screech)

00:35.398 --> 00:36.945
(Engine hissing, metal creaking)

00:40.661 --> 00:42.789
(Liquid dripping)

00:44.375 --> 00:45.409
(Grunting)

00:49.021 --> 00:50.229
Rayna... Rayna?

00:50.845 --> 00:52.304
Baby? Baby, wake up. (Car door opens)

00:53.010 --> 00:53.891
(Breathing heavily)

00:55.050 --> 00:57.931
Hold on. (groaning)

01:02.646 --> 01:04.163
(Thud)

01:05.515 --> 01:06.429
Come on, babe.

01:06.599 --> 01:08.206
Baby, wake up. You gotta wake up.

01:09.404 --> 01:11.422
Aah! (Grunting)

01:12.480 --> 01:15.071
(Siren wailing in distance)

01:15.265 --> 01:16.578
Aah!

01:16.953 --> 01:19.724
(Panting)

01:22.423 --> 01:24.366
(Rayna) What are we doing here?

01:24.606 --> 01:25.888
Oh, my gosh.

01:26.061 --> 01:27.633
All right, we're gonna
have to do this fast,

01:27.791 --> 01:29.467
'cause I gotta get to my C.M.A. Rehearsal.

01:29.617 --> 01:30.781
(Deacon) Well, what's more important,

01:30.951 --> 01:32.331
me or a C.M.A. Rehearsal?

01:32.503 --> 01:33.796
Well, it's not a competition,

01:33.977 --> 01:36.522
- but it is my first nomination, so...
- Yeah, well, it's not gonna be your last.

01:36.814 --> 01:38.060
All right, come on.

01:40.194 --> 01:41.536
(Gasps)

01:41.766 --> 01:43.510
Now look, I know when you're
a big country superstar,

01:43.703 --> 01:45.241
this might not seem
like much, but for now...

01:45.410 --> 01:46.911
It's my dream house.

01:47.143 --> 01:48.568
There's still about 300 payments left

01:48.722 --> 01:50.081
on your dream house, but, uh...

01:50.237 --> 01:52.569
- You're not supposed to make big decisions.
- After rehab, I know.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.972
But you weren't supposed to
have to take my drunk ass there

01:55.145 --> 01:57.174
in the first place, so... Mmm.

01:58.229 --> 01:59.450
(Whispers) Thank you...

02:00.353 --> 02:01.595
For loving me more than I deserve.

02:01.861 --> 02:03.248
I know.

02:04.407 --> 02:06.500
You happy?

02:06.721 --> 02:08.585
Yeah, I'm happy. (Chuckles)

02:09.396 --> 02:10.359
What's the matter?

02:10.695 --> 02:11.760
(Exhales)

02:11.908 --> 02:13.616
You're just so damn beautiful.

02:14.348 --> 02:19.663
(Monitor beeping steadily,
ventilator whooshing)

02:19.845 --> 02:21.687
(Daphne) How much longer
does she have to stay asleep?

02:21.871 --> 02:23.105
(Maddie) She's not sleeping.

02:23.289 --> 02:26.307
She's in a coma... One they put her in.

02:27.007 --> 02:28.730
The doctors keep her this
way because they're worried

02:28.905 --> 02:30.388
about brain damage, too.

02:30.562 --> 02:33.371
Sometimes a person's brain
can get a little swollen.

02:33.858 --> 02:35.592
That could be really dangerous.

02:36.255 --> 02:38.338
But the doctors... they're...
they're watching her,

02:39.113 --> 02:40.917
and they're checking on her all the time.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.032
But it's already been two weeks.

02:43.441 --> 02:44.659
I know, baby.

02:47.704 --> 02:49.223
All right, you two.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.709
Can I stay with her today?

02:50.880 --> 02:52.213
I wanna stay, too.

02:53.314 --> 02:54.659
I'll check with your father.

02:55.983 --> 02:57.328
(Man) Deacon Claybourne.

02:58.121 --> 02:58.874
Yes, your honor?

02:59.054 --> 03:00.027
Mr. Claybourne, you're being charged with

03:00.174 --> 03:02.201
driving under the influence
and reckless driving.

03:02.581 --> 03:04.119
Now did you receive adequate medical care

03:04.281 --> 03:06.994
- while you were in the hospital jail ward?
- Yes, your honor.

03:07.466 --> 03:08.560
(Lowered voice) If he thinks
he's getting out of there

03:08.745 --> 03:09.995
while my wife fights for her life,

03:10.214 --> 03:11.093
- he better think again.
- Ex.

03:11.645 --> 03:13.305
Just tell me you made my
position clear to the judge.

03:13.574 --> 03:14.782
I did.

03:15.005 --> 03:16.109
Helps that you're the mayor.

03:16.322 --> 03:17.513
Sir, given your past criminal record,

03:17.750 --> 03:20.065
and given the danger you appear
to pose to yourself and to others,

03:21.179 --> 03:23.744
I'm setting the bail at $1 million.

03:24.387 --> 03:26.047
(Gallery murmuring)

03:26.714 --> 03:28.199
Now you have the right to an attorney,

03:28.399 --> 03:29.521
and one will be appointed
for you should you...

03:29.643 --> 03:30.885
Don't want one.

03:31.193 --> 03:33.267
Does this mean you intend
to represent yourself?

03:33.472 --> 03:34.866
Just ready to plead guilty.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.275
Mr. Claybourne, your passenger
remains in critical condition,

03:38.589 --> 03:40.019
and if she does not survive,

03:40.377 --> 03:42.144
these charges are going to be upgraded

03:42.482 --> 03:44.188
to involuntary manslaughter.

03:44.501 --> 03:46.032
Say "yes" to a lawyer.

03:46.569 --> 03:48.101
(Gavel bangs) Next case.

03:48.398 --> 03:49.471
Let's go.

03:55.588 --> 03:57.849
<i>(Woman on TV) Seen by many as the
reigning queen of country music,</i>

03:58.029 --> 03:59.944
<i>Rayna's storied career has won fans</i>

04:00.151 --> 04:03.092
<i>all across the globe,
and although hospitalized,</i>

04:03.293 --> 04:05.148
<i>she continues to do so.</i>

04:05.343 --> 04:07.055
Okay. Personal assistant candidate

04:07.221 --> 04:08.491
should be here any minute.

04:09.089 --> 04:10.148
<i>Accident that's left her clinging to life,</i>

04:10.350 --> 04:11.495
<i>it's clear this queen</i>

04:13.669 --> 04:15.283
<i>Fans continue to visit the...</i>

04:15.528 --> 04:16.851
- Hey, you all right?
- My album drops tomorrow.

04:17.134 --> 04:18.314
If she's holding on to number one,

04:18.572 --> 04:19.755
you know what that means for me?

04:19.934 --> 04:21.892
It's hard enough to bust
out of this tween demo.

04:22.077 --> 04:23.823
Now I have to compete
with a Saint in a coma.

04:24.110 --> 04:25.763
(TV turns off, remote control
clatters) Juliette, look, it doesn't...

04:25.903 --> 04:27.365
I want the release date pushed.

04:27.582 --> 04:29.361
Call Marshall. Tell him we
need to set up a meeting...

04:29.508 --> 04:30.806
Marshall's not the decision maker anymore.

04:30.995 --> 04:32.245
Well, then tell whoever's in charge.

04:32.425 --> 04:34.406
The label's just been sucked
into this massive conglomerate.

04:34.586 --> 04:36.032
Now trust me. Their board of directors

04:36.248 --> 04:38.336
does not give a damn
about Edgehill Records,

04:38.946 --> 04:40.224
and until they name a new president,

04:40.539 --> 04:42.178
there's nobody there for me or you

04:42.576 --> 04:44.737
to yell at. (Doorbell rings)
I mean, if it were up to me,

04:44.979 --> 04:47.156
you wouldn't do an album
launch concert tomorrow.

04:47.445 --> 04:48.824
You just lost your mom.

04:49.030 --> 04:50.509
(Door opens) Now this
thing with Rayna, you know?

04:50.682 --> 04:51.896
Sweetie, look, you need a break.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.166
- You need...
- A break is last thing that I need, Glenn.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.820
(Door closes) (Bo) Right this way.

04:56.242 --> 04:57.471
(Man) I'm here for the job interview?

04:57.719 --> 04:59.416
(Sighs) Tell me you're an orphan,

04:59.617 --> 05:00.801
because the woman you'd be replacing

05:01.045 --> 05:03.556
has a sick relative, which has
been very inconvenient for me.

05:03.772 --> 05:06.155
I'm an only child, and
both folks have passed.

05:06.394 --> 05:08.725
I'm... sorry that she
left you in the lurch.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.894
I was just walking my manager out.

05:14.777 --> 05:15.870
(Lowered voice) I can handle this.

05:17.647 --> 05:18.648
You deal with Edgehill.

05:18.856 --> 05:21.399
There is no way I'm letting old
Rayna Jaymes songs tank my record.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.885
(Lowered voice) Is that what you're
really the most concerned about right now?

05:27.036 --> 05:30.347
(Scarlett, lowered voice) It's my
last night, so don't tell anybody.

05:31.003 --> 05:32.349
This is on the house.

and then get all those front tables served

05:45.375 --> 05:46.500

05:46.675 --> 05:48.010
- Got it.

Rayna's gonna be just fine.

tell me what I wanna hear?

10:13.560 --> 10:15.030
Yeah, only if you call me "Juliette".

10:15.205 --> 10:17.003
We did plan a birthday party together once.

That was a really sweet thing
you did for Deacon. Um...

10:20.609 --> 10:21.950

10:22.376 --> 10:23.712
if you would be kind enough

10:24.243 --> 10:25.949
to consider helping me help him.

10:26.165 --> 10:27.365
I got an advance on my record deal

10:27.603 --> 10:29.740
and a little bit of money
from my mama for his bail.

10:29.964 --> 10:33.204
It would be a loan, and I
would pay you back every penny,

10:33.769 --> 10:35.649
but I don't think he
deserves to be in jail.

10:36.538 --> 10:39.281
Let him got all right? Addicts are addicts.

10:39.477 --> 10:41.635
You will spend all your time

you're gonna get in return

is a broken heart when
he disappoints you again,

to meet, though. Hey, Laycee!

Yeah, it doesn't really work like that.

here because you've made a decision.

Look, I know it'd be better for you
if I just took care of things, but...

- Rayna, can you hear me?
- Okay, we're holding sedation.

15:24.676 --> 15:26.288
We're lowering your sedation level so
we can perform some cognitive tests.

they're running some tests,

a little, but not lately.

gaining weight. (Chuckles)

Any cramping or bleeding?

16:20.564 --> 16:22.249

16:52.205 --> 16:53.937
Before I do this next song,

16:54.211 --> 16:56.020
I wanna take a moment
to talk about somebody

16:56.708 --> 16:58.277
really important to me.

16:58.725 --> 17:02.212
That's right. Y'all, give
it up for miss Rayna Jaymes.

17:02.798 --> 17:05.252
(Cheering)

17:08.865 --> 17:12.439
I never imagined that I would
share the stage with my idol,

17:12.633 --> 17:16.247
let alone a mentor and
friend, and now she is both.

17:16.762 --> 17:18.396
(Cheers and applause) And I know tonight

17:18.647 --> 17:20.325
might be about launching my album,

17:20.619 --> 17:22.516
but without her inspiration...

17:22.724 --> 17:25.983
(Camera shutters clicking) And her
influence, I would never be here right now.

17:26.344 --> 17:29.207
(Cheers and applause)

17:29.835 --> 17:32.121
I know we all want her
to get better real quick,

17:32.310 --> 17:35.686
but until she does, I'd like
to continue her tradition,

17:35.880 --> 17:37.791
so this next song's to Rayna.

17:38.048 --> 17:40.375
I only hope I do it
half as well as she does.

'cause that came out the year I was born.

29:48.606 --> 29:49.969
<i>(Rayna) Well, he's here. Thank God.</i>

29:50.135 --> 29:52.590
Right, and so now we
know he bailed on rehab,

29:52.785 --> 29:54.280
made it home safe and sound.

29:54.469 --> 29:56.490
- Let's go.
- I know, but I need to talk to him.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.021
What you need is to just let him go.

29:59.706 --> 30:00.544
Come on.

30:00.773 --> 30:03.734
(Voice breaks) I mean, I'm
pregnant. It's probably his.

30:03.955 --> 30:05.931
I need to just... I need
to at least talk to him.

30:06.129 --> 30:07.365
(Bottles clatter)

30:07.620 --> 30:10.032
He needs help, you know?
And he's... he's sick.

30:10.244 --> 30:11.672
Well, fine, and you've tried to help him,

30:11.853 --> 30:13.298
but you cannot help somebody

30:13.487 --> 30:15.730
who doesn't want to help himself. (Thud)

30:16.053 --> 30:17.301
You want him to be the father?

30:17.472 --> 30:18.754
Do you have any idea
what could happen to you

30:18.933 --> 30:20.707
<i>or to that baby if he was?</i>

30:23.072 --> 30:24.318
(Buzzer, door opens)

30:25.078 --> 30:27.048
- Thought I made myself clear...
- Single vehicle accident

30:27.266 --> 30:28.558
involving the male owner
of a car (Door closes)

30:28.719 --> 30:30.126
With two prior D.U.I.s

30:30.341 --> 30:32.838
and a blood alcohol level of
over twice the legal limit.

30:33.067 --> 30:34.846
The female occupant had zero.

30:35.044 --> 30:36.948
When the police ask who was
responsible for the crash,

30:37.150 --> 30:39.812
not surprisingly, the
car's owner said it was him.

30:40.011 --> 30:41.632
Yeah, I was there... And with
no reason to disbelieve you,

30:41.819 --> 30:43.260
- the police stopped investigating.
- It's kinda late.

30:43.458 --> 30:46.415
Don't you have a husband or, like,
kids to get home to or something?

30:46.882 --> 30:47.913
(Chair scrapes floor)

30:48.106 --> 30:49.135
I found a hospital report

30:49.306 --> 30:50.751
that references diagonal bruising

30:50.918 --> 30:52.379
across Ms. Jaymes' abdomen,

30:52.608 --> 30:54.808
2 inches wide from upper
left to bottom right.

30:55.206 --> 30:57.301
<i>She was the one behind the wheel.</i>

30:58.197 --> 31:00.309
If I hadn't been drinking,
none of it would've happened.

31:00.479 --> 31:01.316
Did your reckless actions

31:01.523 --> 31:03.805
contribute to a tragic accident? Probably.

31:04.966 --> 31:07.662
Did you commit a crime? No.

31:19.357 --> 31:20.462
Good party.

31:20.744 --> 31:22.344
Ended a little sooner
than I thought it would.

31:22.501 --> 31:23.904
I'm an idiot. You know that?

31:24.117 --> 31:26.371
Well... Burning the furniture

31:26.534 --> 31:28.127
might not have been the
smartest thing to do.

31:28.309 --> 31:29.577
Uh, you're an idiot, too.

31:29.744 --> 31:31.561
Oh, hang on there, man.
I was just trying to help.

31:31.728 --> 31:32.962
I can't do this, man.

31:33.673 --> 31:35.903
I can't do it. I can't
"party" my feelings away,

31:36.226 --> 31:37.818
and I can't go around
screwing random girls.

31:37.986 --> 31:39.091
I'm not like you.

31:39.268 --> 31:40.952
I can't pretend I'm
feeling something I'm not.

31:41.794 --> 31:43.683
Look, I'm not judging you
for staying in the closet...

31:43.852 --> 31:46.501
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey. I'm not
in any damn closet, all right?

31:46.746 --> 31:48.228
Get that through your skull.

31:48.732 --> 31:50.170
(Man speaking indistinctly)

31:50.404 --> 31:52.315
Okay. I guess it's just me

31:52.482 --> 31:54.171
who's been avoiding my feelings then.

31:55.624 --> 31:57.711
(Huffs) I'm going to the Bluebird, man.

31:58.433 --> 32:01.215
They're having a party that
actually celebrates somethin'.

32:02.763 --> 32:04.965
(Cheers and whistles) (Giggles)

32:05.248 --> 32:06.676
(Cheering)

32:06.940 --> 32:08.467
Oh, I'm gonna miss you guys so much.

32:08.646 --> 32:10.046
I think I'm even gonna miss this thing.

32:10.207 --> 32:13.065
- Let's toast... to Scarlett.
- (All) To Scarlett!

32:13.239 --> 32:15.252
Thank you. Um, just let
me... Let me go hang this up.

32:15.522 --> 32:16.908
Keep drinking. (Laughter)

32:17.190 --> 32:18.548
<i>(Leagues' "You Belong Here" playing)</i>

Hi.

32:26.580 --> 32:27.700

32:27.868 --> 32:29.923
Yeah. I guess we've
been on different shifts.

32:30.151 --> 32:31.928

Yeah, of course.

but what occurs to me is, um,

33:36.478 --> 33:38.253
I'm leaving this place because

33:38.518 --> 33:40.061
I've been signed by Rayna Jaymes.

33:40.273 --> 33:41.677
May all of our prayers be with her.

33:50.003 --> 33:53.015
And I wondered if they would
come up and sing with me.

37:37.133 --> 37:39.111

37:39.268 --> 37:40.812
to keep her happy, keep her at home,

37:40.977 --> 37:43.791
keep her from being
drawn to a man like him.

I'm sorry, but please don't stand here

37:51.017 --> 37:52.271
but I saw the writing on the wall,

37:52.464 --> 37:54.247

my wife to pack her bags

37:54.413 --> 37:55.861

Blood pressure and brain
activity are spiking.

38:05.482 --> 38:06.513
I'll get the doctor.

38:06.705 --> 38:08.150
All right, check that
airway. Make sure it's clear.

38:19.383 --> 38:20.949
<i>(Tires screech)</i>

38:30.279 --> 38:31.702
(Doctor) It's not uncommon
for patients to react

38:31.876 --> 38:33.834
to what they're
experiencing subconsciously.

38:34.243 --> 38:35.331
There were no seizures.

38:35.559 --> 38:36.763
In fact, her intracranial pressure

38:36.938 --> 38:38.190
has subsided significantly.

38:38.386 --> 38:40.128
Swelling's gone down.
Blood flow looks good,

38:40.416 --> 38:41.487
as does her E.E.G.

38:41.676 --> 38:42.672
So we're comfortable bringing her

38:42.841 --> 38:44.098
out of the induced coma at this point,

38:44.281 --> 38:45.680
though she'll still need time to recover.

38:45.843 --> 38:47.441
Can the family be present for that?

38:47.607 --> 38:49.580
They can be, but they should
be prepared for any outcome.

38:50.706 --> 38:52.304
Wait. Uh, meaning what?

38:52.849 --> 38:54.096
There's no way for us to know yet

38:54.276 --> 38:56.539
if there's been any impact
on her cognitive abilities.

38:56.731 --> 38:59.037
Are you saying that she's
not gonna recognize us?

38:59.238 --> 39:01.003
She might not recognize anything.

39:18.171 --> 39:19.349
Yeah.

Man, Deacon really fell off
the wagon hard, didn't he?

39:32.173 --> 39:33.474
Yeah, he did.

39:33.681 --> 39:35.101
Wish I knew why.

39:38.650 --> 39:40.312
(Doctor) Okay, Rayna,
you're doing just great.

39:40.498 --> 39:42.591
Stay with us. We're almost

39:42.850 --> 39:44.398

39:47.483 --> 39:48.850
we're gonna take the tube out now,

39:49.184 --> 39:50.326
so what I need you to do

39:50.686 --> 39:53.416
is take a deep breath
and then cough. (Coughs)

39:54.046 --> 39:55.753
(Rayna gags) Very good.

39:57.156 --> 39:59.857
Rayna, you're at Vanderbilt hospital.

40:00.083 --> 40:01.694
Do you understand that? If you do,

40:02.063 --> 40:04.533
blink twice. Now don't try and talk.

40:12.708 --> 40:16.372
All right, now do you know who
the people in the hallway are?

40:30.989 --> 40:32.137
They can come in.

40:32.348 --> 40:33.713

40:52.055 --> 40:52.953
What?

40:58.318 --> 40:59.400
(Sighs heavily)

40:59.679 --> 41:00.996
You're being released.

41:02.507 --> 41:03.901
What, somebody post my bail?

41:04.060 --> 41:06.877
No. Someone confirmed you weren't driving.

41:07.058 --> 41:08.885
(Scoffs) Who did that?

41:09.037 --> 41:10.473
Rayna.

41:11.673 --> 41:13.140
She's conscious.

41:15.495 --> 41:16.955
I'll give you a minute.

41:19.893 --> 41:20.939
(Exhaling)

41:25.737 --> 41:27.348
(Exhales deeply)

41:28.202 --> 41:29.080
(Man) Tandy Hampton?

41:29.233 --> 41:30.894
- Yes?
- Justin Ramer, U.S. attorney's office.

41:31.074 --> 41:35.133
Oh, you people really
need to stop harassing me.

41:35.582 --> 41:37.121
I already told your boss I'm not interested

41:37.511 --> 41:40.494
in helping make any sort
of case against my father.

41:40.955 --> 41:43.594
And if any of this information
is coming from Teddy Conrad,

41:43.900 --> 41:46.091
you should seriously consider the source.

41:46.262 --> 41:48.233
Before you go all in
to protect your father,

41:48.413 --> 41:49.461
you should know this.

41:49.630 --> 41:51.275
There's evidence to support his involvement

41:51.450 --> 41:52.768
with your mother's death.

41:53.631 --> 41:57.068
- What?
- That car accident was no accident.

41:57.761 --> 41:59.053
Well, that's ridiculous.

41:59.237 --> 42:01.646
You know your father. You
know what he's capable of.

42:02.037 --> 42:04.125
You just assumed your family was immune.

42:08.451 --> 42:11.331
The nurse told I'd find you here.

42:12.103 --> 42:14.459
Yeah, I've been coming
out here as much as I can.

42:14.710 --> 42:16.964
Breathe this fresh air, take in this view.

42:17.144 --> 42:19.116
- Well, it's sure a
good one. - Mm-hmm.

42:19.286 --> 42:21.451
Probably not worth being
in the hospital for.

42:21.661 --> 42:24.310
(Chuckles) True that.

42:25.740 --> 42:27.899
He never was any good for you, you know?

42:28.582 --> 42:30.741
- Deacon.
- Yeah, I know who you're talking about.

42:31.348 --> 42:32.840
I'm just...

42:33.609 --> 42:35.621
I'm not interested in
looking behind me anymore.

42:35.791 --> 42:37.837
I'm just gonna live my life.

42:38.875 --> 42:40.651
It's always best to just

42:40.957 --> 42:43.007
leave the past behind.
