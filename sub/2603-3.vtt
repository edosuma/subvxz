The 2011 Tesla Roadster Sport,

00:28.677 --> 00:30.676
offered only to our most
exclusive members.

00:30.744 --> 00:32.174
You know your vehicles.

00:32.241 --> 00:35.176
I promise to have her back
before she turns into a Pontiac.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.246
- Hey, Harvey.
- Laurence.

00:37.314 --> 00:38.952
How would you feel
about taking something

00:39.020 --> 00:40.353
other than the Tesla tonight?

00:40.420 --> 00:42.521
- It goes against my policy.
- What policy?

00:42.588 --> 00:44.524
My "I want the Tesla" policy.

00:44.591 --> 00:46.193
- Yeah.
- Tell you what.

00:46.261 --> 00:48.894
You know more
about the car than I do,

00:48.961 --> 00:54.667
it's yours.

00:54.735 --> 00:56.036
Horsepower.

00:56.104 --> 00:57.904
Really?
That's where we're starting?

00:57.973 --> 01:00.309
Well, if it's so simple,
just answer it.

01:00.377 --> 01:02.845
288. Top speed.

01:02.914 --> 01:05.415
125 miles an hour.

01:05.483 --> 01:06.616
0 to 60--

01:06.684 --> 01:08.384
3.7 seconds.

01:08.452 --> 01:09.952
Yeah.
You know your cars.

01:10.020 --> 01:11.387
I'm an enthusiast.

01:11.455 --> 01:13.522
And I've been waiting
for the Tesla for months.

01:13.590 --> 01:15.691
Okay.

01:18.527 --> 01:20.296
Laurence.

01:22.498 --> 01:24.766
Knock yourself out.

01:24.833 --> 01:26.066
So why'd you let him have it?

01:26.134 --> 01:27.634
Because it never hurts
to have a man

01:27.702 --> 01:30.035
who runs a $2 billion
hedge fund owe you one.

01:30.103 --> 01:31.703
But if you're
just gonna give it to him,

01:31.771 --> 01:33.338
why bother to compete first?

01:33.406 --> 01:34.506
Because if I didn't beat him,

01:34.574 --> 01:36.075
he wouldn't feel
he owed me one.

01:36.142 --> 01:37.843
I'm suddenly
feeling old school.

01:37.911 --> 01:40.147
Why don't you surprise me, huh?

01:47.556 --> 01:51.659
Are you Mike Ross?

01:51.727 --> 01:54.562

02:21.386 --> 02:23.488
Shut up.
Listen.

02:23.556 --> 02:24.723
You see these cars?

02:24.791 --> 02:26.191
Yeah. They're awesome.

02:26.259 --> 02:27.326
They suck.

02:27.394 --> 02:29.161
They're nothing
compared to this.

02:30.697 --> 02:33.032
The engine in this car
is made by McKernon Motors,

02:33.100 --> 02:35.934
the industry standard
in formula one.

02:36.002 --> 02:37.970
In fact, they've won
more championships

02:38.038 --> 02:39.638
than any other engine
on the planet.

02:39.706 --> 02:41.039
How do you know all this?

02:41.107 --> 02:42.941
Avery McKernon
was the first client

02:43.008 --> 02:44.242
I ever brought into the firm.

02:44.309 --> 02:46.444
- Was?
- He died three months ago.

02:46.512 --> 02:47.611
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry--

02:47.679 --> 02:48.779
Not the point.

02:48.847 --> 02:50.714
McKernon's engines
and his company

02:50.782 --> 02:53.350
have something in common--
They win, like me.

02:53.417 --> 02:56.219
And because I win, I've been
promoted to senior partner,

02:56.287 --> 02:58.055
which means you'll be handling
all their paperwork.

02:58.122 --> 02:59.356
Oh, so you brought me here

02:59.424 --> 03:00.791
to give me an appreciation
for the product.

03:00.858 --> 03:02.393
No, I brought you here
to meet Robert Stensland,

03:02.461 --> 03:03.661
the new CEO.

03:03.729 --> 03:05.329
He'll want to put
your name with a face.

03:05.397 --> 03:06.297
How do you know?

03:06.365 --> 03:07.899
Because Robert's a tightwad,

03:07.966 --> 03:09.100
and we don't bill you out
for nothing.

03:09.167 --> 03:10.368
Wait a minute.

03:10.435 --> 03:11.669
Is this conversation
right now billable?

03:11.737 --> 03:12.803
You bet your ass it is.

03:12.871 --> 03:16.840
Yes. Up top. Come on.

03:16.908 --> 03:17.975
What? We're making
all this money.

03:18.043 --> 03:19.110
We can't celebrate it?

03:19.177 --> 03:22.179
Not in poor taste.

03:22.247 --> 03:25.683
Dominic. Mike, I'd like
you to meet Dominic Barone,

03:25.750 --> 03:28.185
the man responsible
for the design and production

03:28.253 --> 03:29.519
of this engine.

03:29.587 --> 03:31.254
This is my new associate,
Mike Ross.

03:31.322 --> 03:32.656
He's just a kid.

03:32.723 --> 03:34.023
Are you trying to steal his soul
before he hits puberty?

03:34.091 --> 03:35.491
Okay, obviously...

03:35.559 --> 03:37.227
You're still upset
about our labor negotiations.

03:37.294 --> 03:38.695
My-- My workers
took a big hit.

03:38.763 --> 03:40.397
And McKernon took a bigger one.

03:40.465 --> 03:43.267
Both of which poised the company
to be strong for years.

03:43.335 --> 03:44.668
I was always
straight with you about that.

03:44.736 --> 03:46.636
Sophisticated words
for a guy who screwed us.

03:46.704 --> 03:47.571
Look, I'm sorry
you feel that way,

03:47.638 --> 03:48.905
but you have to admit,

03:48.973 --> 03:53.343
I did have the courtesy
to do it from the front.

03:53.411 --> 03:55.512
Wow. Yeah,
he really appreciates

03:55.580 --> 03:56.847
what you've done
for the company.

03:56.915 --> 03:58.282
Robert Stensland,

03:58.349 --> 04:01.252
I'd like you to meet
your new associate, Mike Ross.

04:01.319 --> 04:03.287
We're not paying him
what we pay you.

04:03.355 --> 04:06.324
Nor should you, but I assure
you he's highly effective.

04:06.391 --> 04:08.526
Well, I'll believe it
when I see it.

04:08.594 --> 04:10.528
I had him read
your corporate lease last week.

04:10.596 --> 04:12.363
Ask him anything.

04:12.431 --> 04:15.967
That's a 300-page document.

04:16.035 --> 04:19.370
Okay, what are the terms?

04:19.438 --> 04:21.238
Okay, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

04:21.307 --> 04:22.874
The named lessee

04:22.941 --> 04:25.276
was the parent company,
Glendon Enterprises.

04:25.344 --> 04:28.946
35,000 square feet
at 19 west 57th.

04:29.014 --> 04:30.347
$80 a foot.

04:30.415 --> 04:33.617
Expires in six months
with an option to extend.

04:33.685 --> 04:35.119
Exercisable in 30 days.

04:35.187 --> 04:38.289
- Who signed the lease?
- You did.

04:38.357 --> 04:40.658
- What's my middle name?
- The letter "L."

04:40.725 --> 04:43.294
What happens in the event
the company no longer exists?

04:43.362 --> 04:44.562
That wasn't in the lease.

04:44.630 --> 04:45.896
How can you be sure?

04:45.964 --> 04:47.832
Because the lease
I read wasn't 300 pages.

04:47.900 --> 04:49.334
It was 364.

04:49.402 --> 04:51.337
And I can tell you what's on
any one of those pages,

04:51.404 --> 04:52.671
but I can't tell you that.

04:52.739 --> 04:54.306
That's how I can be sure.

04:54.374 --> 04:55.707
Excellent.

04:55.775 --> 04:57.643
You can get him started
on the new deal right away.

04:57.710 --> 04:59.344
- New deal?
- Yeah.

04:59.412 --> 05:02.681
I have found a buyer
willing to spend $200 million

05:02.749 --> 05:04.216
for the ground underneath
the flagship factory.

05:04.284 --> 05:05.851
Where are you moving
manufacturing?

05:05.918 --> 05:07.219
Well, that's the beauty of it.

05:07.286 --> 05:09.788
The real asset of
McKernon Motors is the name.

05:09.855 --> 05:11.890
We move overseas,
we save ourselves a bundle.

05:11.957 --> 05:13.658
Up front payout
while retaining the name

05:13.726 --> 05:14.759
and maintaining
cash flow over time.

05:14.827 --> 05:17.029
That's genius.
Exactly.

05:17.096 --> 05:18.264
All right,
we'll take care of everything.

05:18.331 --> 05:20.533
- Okay.
- All right.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.037
- Thanks.
- Really?

05:24.105 --> 05:25.939
Jesus.
I knew he was cheap.

05:26.007 --> 05:27.041
I didn't realize
he was an idiot.

05:27.108 --> 05:28.509
What are you talking about?

05:28.576 --> 05:30.211
The asset's not the name.
It's the quality.

05:30.279 --> 05:32.280
He moves overseas,
it's gonna kill the goose

05:32.347 --> 05:33.347
that laid
the goddamn golden engine.

05:33.415 --> 05:34.582
Wait a minute.

05:34.650 --> 05:35.683
I thought you didn't get

05:35.751 --> 05:37.485
emotionally attached
to the client.

05:37.553 --> 05:38.886
I'm emotionally attached to me.

05:38.954 --> 05:41.221
Look, I made a bet
that this company would grow

05:41.289 --> 05:43.023
and my billables
would grow with it.

05:43.091 --> 05:44.291
We're holding a pair of aces,

05:44.359 --> 05:46.026
and this asshole's
trying to fold.

05:46.094 --> 05:47.694
So?
What are you gonna do?

05:47.762 --> 05:48.895
I'm not gonna do anything.

05:48.963 --> 05:49.930
You're gonna
go through those bylaws,

05:49.998 --> 05:51.065
and you're gonna find me a way

05:51.132 --> 05:52.433
to get rid of Robert Stensland.

05:52.501 --> 05:53.701
No, no, no, no.
I have to go see my grandmother.

05:53.769 --> 05:55.169
Uh-uh.
- Is she dying?

05:55.237 --> 05:56.938
No.

05:57.006 --> 05:58.874
Cancel on her.

06:29.917 --> 06:33.498
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

07:04.400 --> 07:05.400
Yeah.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.601
Did you find anything

07:06.669 --> 07:07.569
that'll help me
get rid of Stensland?

07:07.637 --> 07:10.505
Uh, yeah, I think so.

07:10.573 --> 07:11.907
Well, if you're not here
when I need it,

07:11.975 --> 07:12.942
what good does that do me?

07:13.010 --> 07:15.444
What? It's 7:15...

07:36.834 --> 07:37.767
Did you get it?

07:37.835 --> 07:39.502
Picked it up yesterday.

07:39.569 --> 07:41.404
Did you sleep with it
under your pillow?

07:41.471 --> 07:42.705
How I sleep
is none of your concern.

07:42.772 --> 07:44.506
Yeah, neither
is the Yankees' batting order,

07:44.574 --> 07:45.975
but that doesn't stop me
from thinking about it.

07:46.043 --> 07:48.878
Harvey.
Promise me you won't be cocky.

07:48.946 --> 07:50.380
I understand
what's at stake here.

07:50.447 --> 07:51.481
I'll be perfectly humble.

07:51.549 --> 07:52.816
Great.
You ready?

07:52.884 --> 07:55.619
You kidding?
I was born for this.

07:55.687 --> 07:58.723
7:45.
Nice of you to show up.

07:58.791 --> 08:00.458
Uh, yeah, I was up
till 5:00 in the morning.

08:00.526 --> 08:02.461
I'm kidding.
But Louis Litt wants to see you,

08:02.529 --> 08:03.629
and I don't kid about that.

08:03.696 --> 08:04.930
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

08:04.997 --> 08:06.364
Louis doesn't let me in
on his game plan,

08:06.432 --> 08:07.899
but I kind of
prefer it that way.

08:07.967 --> 08:10.034
Okay, um, can you tell him
that I have to see Harvey first?

08:10.102 --> 08:11.435
Your call.

08:11.503 --> 08:13.604
But, uh, if you're gonna be
sleeping in your suits,

08:13.671 --> 08:15.405
you may want to keep
a fresh one in the office.

08:15.473 --> 08:16.440
Is it that bad?

08:16.507 --> 08:18.475
It's worse.

08:18.542 --> 08:20.143
Come on.

08:20.211 --> 08:21.778
I'd just like to say
this is an honor,

08:21.845 --> 08:23.012
I take it seriously,

08:23.079 --> 08:24.780
and I intend
to make you all proud.

08:24.848 --> 08:26.315
Except you, Fred.

08:26.383 --> 08:30.120
I gave up on making
you proud in '99.

08:30.188 --> 08:34.024
Okay. There is one more
order of business.

08:34.092 --> 08:36.626
He's not here.

08:40.600 --> 08:44.236
No.

08:44.304 --> 08:45.604
Where is he?

08:45.672 --> 08:47.039
He's at his senior partner
initiation.

08:47.106 --> 08:48.974
Oh. That's great.
But let me ask you something.

08:49.042 --> 08:51.443
What's the difference
between a senior partner

08:51.511 --> 08:53.478
and...Other partners?

08:53.546 --> 08:55.113
Isn't that something
you should have been studying

08:55.181 --> 08:57.915
when you were pretending
to go to Harvard?

08:57.983 --> 09:00.818
Okay. Senior partners,
they buy into the firm.

09:00.885 --> 09:01.985
They share in the profits,

09:02.053 --> 09:03.186
but they also
have to put up equity.

09:03.254 --> 09:06.022
So how much does it cost
to buy in?

09:06.090 --> 09:09.525
$1/2 million...
Right now?

09:09.593 --> 09:11.760
Harvey, you knew
what the buy-in was.

09:11.828 --> 09:13.829
You knew today was initiation.

09:13.897 --> 09:15.498
How could you not
have the money?

09:15.565 --> 09:19.835
I didn't think
it was due today.

09:19.902 --> 09:21.136
It's not due today, is it?

09:21.204 --> 09:23.272
No. It's not.

09:26.109 --> 09:28.912
Every man in this room
fell for exactly the same thing.

09:28.979 --> 09:29.979
Does that include you?

09:30.047 --> 09:31.648
No.
No, it doesn't.

09:31.716 --> 09:33.917
Thank you, gentlemen.

09:44.831 --> 09:47.098
Peanuts, gluten, strawberries.

09:47.166 --> 09:48.900
What is this?
A shopping list?

09:48.967 --> 09:50.501
No, it's just a list of foods
that I'm allergic to,

09:50.569 --> 09:52.336
so when you select the venue,

09:52.404 --> 09:54.305
these foods
are not to be on the menu.

09:54.372 --> 09:55.606
A venue for what?

09:55.674 --> 09:57.974
No one told you?

09:58.042 --> 09:59.375
- No one told me.
- Oh, drats.

09:59.443 --> 10:01.944
Well, a long-standing
Pearson Hardman tradition

10:02.012 --> 10:03.179
is the rookie dinner,

10:03.247 --> 10:05.348
which means you, the...

10:05.416 --> 10:06.749
- Rookie. Yes.
- That's right.

10:06.817 --> 10:10.921
Are to host a dinner
for your fellow associates.

10:10.988 --> 10:12.856
Well, come on.
Don't look so blue.

10:12.924 --> 10:14.190
Oh, it's okay.
It's really easy.

10:14.258 --> 10:16.326
All you have to do
is just find a unique location

10:16.394 --> 10:18.228
and then coordinate
with 50 other associates.

10:18.295 --> 10:20.830
It's really simple.
No pressure.

10:20.897 --> 10:22.064
And you're allergic to chicken?

10:22.132 --> 10:25.067
No, I just don't like it.

10:25.135 --> 10:27.803
Oh, by the way,
what was so important

10:27.871 --> 10:29.772
that you had to see Harvey
before you came to see me?

10:29.839 --> 10:31.173
Louis,
Harvey doesn't really--

10:31.241 --> 10:33.575
Can we-- Can we-- Can we--
Can we just-- Shut up.

10:33.643 --> 10:34.910
Okay.

10:34.978 --> 10:36.845
Let me just get something
straight, okay?

10:36.913 --> 10:37.946
When I ask you a question,

10:38.014 --> 10:41.116
I just expect an answer.

10:44.586 --> 10:45.754
McKernon Motors.

10:45.821 --> 10:48.257
I was working
on the due diligence.

10:48.325 --> 10:53.997
And why would that require you
to look at the bylaws?

10:54.065 --> 10:55.766
State law requires
a summary be prepared

10:55.834 --> 10:57.101
in the event of a sale.

10:57.169 --> 10:58.970
Privately held corporations
are exempted.

10:59.038 --> 11:01.072
Not if the sale
exceeds 150 million.

11:01.140 --> 11:03.709
According to who?

11:07.080 --> 11:09.648
The state's website.

11:09.716 --> 11:12.051
I like to be thorough.

11:13.654 --> 11:16.088
Well, put it there, buddy.

11:16.156 --> 11:17.557
Are you fricking serious?

11:21.929 --> 11:24.364
I understand Stensland
is throwing a large amount

11:24.432 --> 11:27.167
of legal work our way with the
McKernon Motors factory sale.

11:27.235 --> 11:28.202
How'd you know that?

11:28.270 --> 11:29.303
I hear things.

11:29.371 --> 11:30.438
You taking care of him?

11:30.505 --> 11:31.706
I am.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.975
By the way, for when it is due.

11:34.043 --> 11:35.310
What's this?

11:35.377 --> 11:38.047
It's a cashier's check
for $500,000.

11:39.749 --> 11:41.684
You had this the whole time.

11:41.752 --> 11:44.920
I've had the money since I
set my sights on senior partner.

11:52.361 --> 11:53.961
Nice of you to finally make it.

11:54.029 --> 11:55.896
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

11:55.964 --> 11:57.230
Because you're
supposed to be here

11:57.298 --> 11:58.265
when you're supposed
to be here.

11:58.332 --> 11:59.733
Doesn't seem to apply to you.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.668
I'm not the topic
of this conversation.

12:01.735 --> 12:04.237
Now what'd you find me
on McKernon Motors?

12:04.305 --> 12:06.640
The board can't vote
for at least 24 hours

12:06.708 --> 12:08.442
after the CEO presents a deal

12:08.509 --> 12:09.810
involving the sale
of company land.

12:09.878 --> 12:11.946
But Stensland already
presented it to the board.

12:12.014 --> 12:14.483
Right, but Stensland isn't CEO.

12:14.550 --> 12:17.652
I wrote those bylaws myself.
He's CEO.

12:17.720 --> 12:21.691
Hmm.
Page 238, clause 137

12:21.758 --> 12:24.127
states if the CEO dies,

12:24.195 --> 12:26.095
an interim CEO
will be appointed

12:26.163 --> 12:27.697
until the board
convenes an election vote,

12:27.764 --> 12:29.932
which can't be called
till the next fiscal quarter,

12:30.000 --> 12:31.900
in this case next Thursday.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.636
So they can't vote him in
until Thursday?

12:34.704 --> 12:35.937
Thursday.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.739
Okay.

12:37.807 --> 12:39.507
Well, prepare the due diligence

12:39.575 --> 12:40.842
for me to take to Stensland,

12:40.909 --> 12:42.309
but I don't want anything
ready to sign.

12:42.377 --> 12:43.844
- Where are you going?
- Out.

12:43.912 --> 12:45.612
I have until Thursday
to find a new CEO.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.381
- Huh.
- What?

12:47.449 --> 12:50.251
Oh, nothing.
Uh, you know, just six hours,

12:50.319 --> 12:53.454
1,500 pages, and I, uh,

12:53.522 --> 12:55.057
I found your mistake.

12:55.124 --> 12:57.559
Yeah, you found
the one mistake I made

12:57.627 --> 13:00.396
while drafting those bylaws
a dozen years ago

13:00.464 --> 13:02.064
when I was two years
younger than you.

13:02.132 --> 13:03.466
A mistake, by the way,

13:03.534 --> 13:05.502
that's gonna help me
get rid of Stensland.

13:05.570 --> 13:07.404
Mistake.

13:24.849 --> 13:26.916
Excuse me, Mr. Specter?

13:26.983 --> 13:28.751
I was wondering if you might
need a hand sometime

13:28.819 --> 13:29.785
with one of your matters.

13:29.853 --> 13:30.819
Uh, any one.

13:30.887 --> 13:32.254
Well, Allen--

13:32.322 --> 13:33.522
It's Aaron.

13:33.590 --> 13:37.059
I think that says it all,
don't you?

13:37.126 --> 13:39.327
What are you doing?

13:39.395 --> 13:41.162
Uh, I'm looking
for a restaurant.

13:41.230 --> 13:42.764
Where did you go
for your rookie dinner?

13:42.832 --> 13:44.399
I came into the league
a sophomore.

13:44.467 --> 13:45.633
You better not be
prioritizing that

13:45.701 --> 13:46.867
over McKernon Motors.

13:46.935 --> 13:48.302
I still need something
to stall Stensland.

13:48.370 --> 13:51.071
It's right here.

13:51.139 --> 13:52.640
What are you
so irritated about?

13:52.707 --> 13:55.075
I spent a day
with a top headhunter I know

13:55.143 --> 13:57.445
who couldn't produce one
legitimate CEO candidate

13:57.513 --> 13:58.580
by Thursday.

13:58.647 --> 13:59.681
What about
that Dominic Barone guy

13:59.749 --> 14:01.016
who runs production?

14:01.083 --> 14:02.618
You said he was responsible
for the engines,

14:02.686 --> 14:04.186
and he clearly cares
about the workers.

14:04.254 --> 14:05.988
No, he's not the guy.

14:06.056 --> 14:07.691
Oh, you're scared
you can't convince him

14:07.758 --> 14:09.426
because he hates you.
I get it.

14:09.493 --> 14:10.694
Nice try.

14:10.761 --> 14:12.029
You know you can't
host your dinner there.

14:12.096 --> 14:14.464
That's a Wachtell, Lipton,
Klein restaurant.

14:14.532 --> 14:16.766
Okay. Fine.

14:16.834 --> 14:18.635
What about this place?

14:18.703 --> 14:20.804
Yeah, that'd be great
if it was 2004.

14:20.871 --> 14:21.938
Oh, my God.

14:22.006 --> 14:26.076
Why does any of this matter?
God.

14:26.144 --> 14:28.811
You see that guy
over there by the fax?

14:28.879 --> 14:33.382
Take a good look.

14:33.450 --> 14:34.884
He's never gonna make partner.

14:34.951 --> 14:36.719
Okay. Let me guess.

14:36.787 --> 14:39.022
Because he threw
a lousy rookie dinner?

14:39.090 --> 14:41.057
No, because he doesn't get it.

14:41.125 --> 14:42.693
Get what?

14:42.760 --> 14:45.863
He doesn't get that doing
good work isn't the whole job.

14:45.931 --> 14:47.431
Part of getting it

14:47.499 --> 14:49.233
is that things like the dinner
actually matter,

14:49.301 --> 14:51.336
even when
you don't think they do.

14:51.403 --> 14:52.771
Look, you were giving me shit

14:52.838 --> 14:54.039
this morning because
I come and go when I want to.

14:54.106 --> 14:55.340
You know why I can do that?

14:55.408 --> 14:57.942
Because when I got here,
I dominated.

14:58.010 --> 15:00.177
They thought I worked
100 hours a day.

15:00.245 --> 15:02.513
Now, no matter
what time I get in,

15:02.580 --> 15:05.816
nobody questions my ability
to get the job done.

15:05.884 --> 15:07.318
Get it through your head.

15:07.386 --> 15:09.186
First impressions last.

15:09.254 --> 15:10.888
You start
behind the eight ball,

15:10.955 --> 15:12.790
you'll never get in front.

15:24.270 --> 15:26.070
- Hey, you busy?
- It's 7:00.

15:26.138 --> 15:28.206
I'm not here
'cause I like the view.

15:28.274 --> 15:29.641
And don't misunderstand me.

15:29.709 --> 15:31.509
When I say "the view,"
I'm referring to your face.

15:31.577 --> 15:33.211
That's funny,
because I'm hideous.

15:33.279 --> 15:35.246
- What's up?
- You're a foodie, right?

15:35.314 --> 15:36.347
Why do you say that?

15:36.415 --> 15:37.683
Because you're the only person

15:37.751 --> 15:39.151
I've ever seen order
a shrimp, red pepper,

15:39.219 --> 15:40.252
and goat cheese pizza.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.888
Well, right,
but without the pepper,

15:41.956 --> 15:43.690
what connects the goat cheese
and the shrimp?

15:43.758 --> 15:45.225
I'm a foodie.

15:45.293 --> 15:47.028
Okay, so I need your help
finding a restaurant

15:47.095 --> 15:48.129
for the rookie dinner.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.431
Well, that's unfortunate,

15:49.498 --> 15:50.966
but I'm swamped,
and I don't have time

15:51.033 --> 15:52.167
to teach you about cuisine.

15:52.235 --> 15:53.535
Well, no,
don't make me remind you

15:53.603 --> 15:55.304
that you owe me one.
How's that?

15:55.371 --> 15:57.205
You told Louis I was working
on Harvey's case before his.

15:57.273 --> 15:58.741
Because you told me to.

15:58.808 --> 16:00.376
Well, now I'm telling you
to help me with my dinner.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.545
- You-- Okay.
- Good luck with that.

16:03.613 --> 16:05.848
Not gonna help me
with my dinner.

16:05.916 --> 16:08.917
Now I'm talking to myself.

16:11.488 --> 16:12.787
Yeah, grammy.

16:12.855 --> 16:14.256
No, I told you I was coming.

16:14.323 --> 16:20.228
I'm-- I'm on my way, okay?
Yeah.

16:20.296 --> 16:23.697
Um, 15 minutes.

16:23.765 --> 16:25.999
Okay. Bye.
Hey, what are you--

16:26.067 --> 16:28.402
Okay, what was that for?

16:28.469 --> 16:29.669
If you cared about me,

16:29.737 --> 16:31.037
you would have told me
what Trevor was up to

16:31.105 --> 16:32.005
a long time ago.

16:32.072 --> 16:33.406
I was trying to protect you.

16:33.474 --> 16:35.174
How is hiding the fact

16:35.242 --> 16:37.577
that my boyfriend
is selling weed protecting me?

16:37.645 --> 16:39.246
You want to know the truth?

16:39.313 --> 16:42.249
Your boyfriend also happens
to be my best friend, all right?

16:42.317 --> 16:43.284
I didn't feel
like ratting him out.

16:43.351 --> 16:44.852
If you were really his friend,

16:44.920 --> 16:46.688
you wouldn't just stand by
and let him throw his life away.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.356
Let him? Let--

16:48.424 --> 16:50.626
I've never let Trevor
do anything. Have you met him?

16:50.693 --> 16:53.195
Trevor listens to you,
and he needs you right now.

16:53.263 --> 16:54.430
Oh, my God.

16:54.498 --> 16:56.232
He is throwing his life away,

16:56.299 --> 16:58.834
and you ditched us.

16:58.902 --> 17:02.038
Both.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.473
Like we didn't mean
anything to you.

17:08.979 --> 17:11.614
I'm...I'm late.

17:32.135 --> 17:34.703
Louis.
What are you doing here?

17:34.771 --> 17:36.939
Hi.
Uh, Stensland called.

17:37.007 --> 17:39.542
And apparently the diligence
wasn't proceeding apace.

17:39.609 --> 17:40.743
He called you?

17:40.811 --> 17:41.577
Yeah, he called me,
I called him,

17:41.645 --> 17:42.746
what's the difference?

17:42.813 --> 17:43.646
The paperwork
was taking too long,

17:43.714 --> 17:45.081
and I got it done.

17:45.149 --> 17:47.251
I suggest you stay
the hell away from my client.

17:47.318 --> 17:49.821
Harvey.
Glad you could make it.

17:49.888 --> 17:50.955
We were about
to sign the papers.

17:51.023 --> 17:51.823
I got word back at the office.

17:51.890 --> 17:52.991
I just came to see how Louis

17:53.058 --> 17:55.593
was getting around the bylaws.

17:55.661 --> 17:57.395
I...Don't know.

17:59.899 --> 18:00.865
I'm at somewhat of a loss.

18:00.933 --> 18:02.267
Robert, I'm sorry.

18:02.334 --> 18:04.102
This is what was holding up
your due diligence.

18:04.169 --> 18:05.937
Technically,
you're still interim CEO

18:06.004 --> 18:07.939
until the board
votes you in on Thursday.

18:08.006 --> 18:09.207
If protocol isn't followed,

18:09.274 --> 18:10.875
it leaves you with huge
litigation exposure.

18:10.943 --> 18:12.210
That's right.

18:12.278 --> 18:15.413
Well, I imagine
we should hold off, then.

18:15.481 --> 18:17.415
Please don't blame Louis.
It's my fault.

18:17.483 --> 18:20.285
We usually have senior partners
oversee transactions like this

18:20.353 --> 18:22.186
because junior partners,
they tend to miss things.

18:22.254 --> 18:23.188
See you Thursday?

18:23.255 --> 18:24.990
One second.

18:25.057 --> 18:26.324
Uh, just so you know,

18:26.392 --> 18:28.193
you were a junior partner
until recently.

18:28.261 --> 18:30.128
There's a reason
I'm not anymore.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.030
Okay. Take it easy.

18:32.098 --> 18:34.666
So what if you took a trip
to Russia with another man?

18:34.734 --> 18:36.801
I mean, that was before
you met grandpa Jimmy, right?

18:36.869 --> 18:39.036
He didn't care
it was before I met him.

18:39.104 --> 18:40.538
Never shut up about it.

18:40.606 --> 18:42.440
So what was
this other guy's name?

18:42.508 --> 18:44.243
Gregory mind your own business.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.179
So, Michael, this has been fun.

18:48.247 --> 18:50.048
Now why don't you stop
beating around the bush

18:50.115 --> 18:55.254
and tell me what's going on.

18:55.321 --> 18:57.556
Trevor.

18:57.624 --> 18:59.258
It's Trevor.
It's always Trevor.

18:59.326 --> 19:01.461
He's gotten himself
into some really bad...

19:01.528 --> 19:04.764
Stuff, and I think he needs
my help to get out of it,

19:04.832 --> 19:07.100
but I've been under
so much pressure,

19:07.168 --> 19:09.169
and I know you've always told
me to be there for people...

19:09.236 --> 19:10.770
No, no, listen to me.

19:10.838 --> 19:12.839
Screw Trevor.
What?

19:12.907 --> 19:14.007
You're moving forward,

19:14.075 --> 19:15.675
and he'll do whatever he can

19:15.743 --> 19:17.143
to keep you where you are.

19:17.211 --> 19:18.144
Yeah, but...

19:18.212 --> 19:19.212
But no buts.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.747
That kid is an anchor.

19:20.815 --> 19:24.584
You need to cut him loose.

19:24.651 --> 19:27.786
- Whoa.
- You owe me 50 bucks.

19:38.130 --> 19:40.899
What's going on
with Robert Stensland?

19:40.966 --> 19:42.333
What did Louis tell you?

19:42.401 --> 19:44.803
You're not dealing with Louis.
You're dealing with me.

19:44.871 --> 19:46.037
What are you hiding?

19:46.105 --> 19:47.238
Nothing.
I looked through the bylaws

19:47.306 --> 19:48.873
and precluded
potential litigation.

19:48.941 --> 19:51.809
You looked at the bylaws
for a tactical reason,

19:51.877 --> 19:52.910
and I want to know what it is.

19:58.650 --> 19:59.917
I want him out.

19:59.984 --> 20:02.185
That is not your call.
You are an attorney.

20:02.253 --> 20:04.787
This is the internal business
of McKernon Motors.

20:04.855 --> 20:06.556
Look, McKernon had a plan,

20:06.624 --> 20:08.191
and I didn't spend
a decade shaping it

20:08.258 --> 20:09.525
to let this fool throw it away.

20:09.593 --> 20:10.826
McKernon is dead.

20:10.894 --> 20:12.094
So what?
Doesn't mean the plan's no good.

20:12.162 --> 20:13.962
You fail, we'll get fired.

20:14.030 --> 20:15.297
He moves overseas,

20:15.365 --> 20:17.066
our billables ll be gone
in five years, anyway.

20:17.134 --> 20:18.735
Better five years than nothing.

20:18.803 --> 20:20.337
You know what?
That's Stensland's attitude,

20:20.404 --> 20:22.673
and it's a losing one.

20:22.740 --> 20:26.010
Harvey, I don't think
you have any business

20:26.078 --> 20:27.979
telling that man
how to run his company,

20:28.047 --> 20:29.848
but I know you don't
have any business

20:29.916 --> 20:31.416
telling me how to run mine.

20:31.484 --> 20:33.052
You are a senior partner.

20:33.119 --> 20:35.154
You are not
a gunslinger anymore.

20:35.222 --> 20:38.023
Back off Stensland
and close the deal.

20:51.195 --> 20:52.496
I need you to prepare

20:52.564 --> 20:54.565
the draft CEO candidate speech
for Thursday.

20:54.632 --> 20:55.900
Well, I thought you
were supposed to back off.

20:55.967 --> 20:57.234
Yeah, I'm supposed to do
a lot of things.

20:57.302 --> 20:59.137
I'll call you with the plan
on my way back.

20:59.205 --> 21:00.372
From where?

21:00.439 --> 21:01.807
From convincing
the man who hates me

21:01.874 --> 21:03.875
to do what I say.
Oh, right.

21:03.943 --> 21:06.344
You mean the guy I suggested
you go to in the first place.

21:06.412 --> 21:07.679
Do you remember that whole

21:07.747 --> 21:08.680
getting it thing
I was talking to you about?

21:08.748 --> 21:10.215
What, I can't even gloat?

21:10.283 --> 21:12.783
Gloating's fine.
You just have to not suck at it.

21:12.851 --> 21:15.820
Okay.
Thank you. So much.

21:15.888 --> 21:17.355
That hurt.

21:23.128 --> 21:24.362
Hey, Ross.

21:24.430 --> 21:25.830
You left your search
for the rookie dinner

21:25.898 --> 21:26.831
on your computer.

21:26.899 --> 21:27.832
Why don't you just save time

21:27.900 --> 21:29.467
and take us to Friday's?

21:29.534 --> 21:30.868
Ooh, ooh, somebody's mad.

21:30.936 --> 21:32.970
Devon, looking at my computer

21:33.038 --> 21:34.971
is a violation of exactly seven

21:35.039 --> 21:36.606
hostile workplace
environment statutes.

21:36.674 --> 21:38.741
What are you gonna do?
Sue me?

21:38.809 --> 21:40.009
No.
No, no, no.

21:40.077 --> 21:41.377
I'm just gonna use it
as legal cover

21:41.445 --> 21:43.445
if I decide to kick your ass.

21:52.955 --> 21:54.356
Dominic.

21:54.423 --> 21:56.024
Harvey,
what are you doing here?

21:56.092 --> 21:57.926
Our contract's good
for two more years.

21:57.994 --> 22:00.695
I need a word.
In private.

22:00.763 --> 22:01.930
Excuse me, bill.

22:01.997 --> 22:03.698
Make it fast,
'cause this is a place

22:03.766 --> 22:05.000
where people actually
work for a living.

22:05.067 --> 22:06.735
Well, keep in mind
people are watching.

22:06.803 --> 22:08.670
Just try to keep
your expression neutral.

22:08.738 --> 22:09.871
You know, they don't teach

22:09.939 --> 22:11.106
deceptive tactics
where I come from.

22:11.174 --> 22:12.041
Then you're gonna learn
under fire.

22:12.109 --> 22:13.976
Stensland's shutting you down.

22:14.044 --> 22:15.378
What? Why?

22:15.446 --> 22:16.847
For money.

22:16.914 --> 22:19.483
He's got a buyer for the land
under the factory.

22:19.551 --> 22:21.185
Why are you coming to me?

22:21.253 --> 22:23.221
Because the only way
to stop him

22:23.289 --> 22:24.989
is for you
to challenge him as CEO.

22:25.057 --> 22:26.190
What?
Are you crazy?

22:26.258 --> 22:27.458
You've got a management title.

22:27.526 --> 22:28.793
That I choose
not to identify with.

22:28.861 --> 22:29.860
You run the factory.

22:29.928 --> 22:31.162
Which I never left,

22:31.229 --> 22:32.530
'cause I have no taste
for boardroom politics.

22:32.598 --> 22:34.132
You've been here since day one.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.633
You know the product
inside out.

22:35.701 --> 22:36.901
These workers,
they respect you.

22:36.969 --> 22:38.803
Pew, that's a lot of smoke.

22:38.871 --> 22:40.472
How many people
did you go to before me?

22:40.540 --> 22:42.107
- Seven.
- Right.

22:42.175 --> 22:44.243
I never said
you were my prom queen.

22:44.310 --> 22:45.677
Look, I want to win, okay?

22:45.745 --> 22:47.179
I went to those other people

22:47.246 --> 22:48.847
because they were better
suited to get past the board,

22:48.915 --> 22:50.649
not better suited for the job.

22:50.717 --> 22:52.818
Those are the facts
whether you like it or not.

22:52.886 --> 22:53.852
And why should I trust you?

22:53.920 --> 22:55.187
Because if you don't,

22:55.255 --> 22:57.423
there aren't any jobs
left to negotiate over.

22:57.490 --> 22:59.525
You and the factory,
you're finished.

23:14.007 --> 23:15.174
What are you working on?

23:15.242 --> 23:17.543
Um, nothing.
Just some stuff for Harvey. Why?

23:17.611 --> 23:19.045
Wrap it up.
Louis Litt wants to see you.

23:19.113 --> 23:21.047
This time
he doesn't want to wait.

23:33.061 --> 23:34.396
Furthermore,

23:34.464 --> 23:36.765
I feel that with
the proper strategic

23:36.833 --> 23:39.702
and synergistic alliances
moving forward--

23:39.769 --> 23:41.738
I have to actually believe
what you're saying.

23:41.806 --> 23:43.707
They're just platitudes
that don't mean anything.

23:43.774 --> 23:45.208
Yes, they do.
Synergistic alliances

23:45.276 --> 23:46.976
mean you form relationships

23:47.044 --> 23:48.611
to get the cost down
and your product out.

23:48.679 --> 23:50.246
It's never gonna work.

23:50.314 --> 23:51.481
Well, it better goddamn work.

23:51.548 --> 23:53.016
My ass is on the line.
What about my ass?

23:53.083 --> 23:54.651
If it wasn't attached
to your thick head,

23:54.719 --> 23:56.553
maybe we wouldn't be
having this problem.

23:56.620 --> 23:57.887
I'm sorry I'm not
as well practiced

23:57.955 --> 24:00.356
at corporate double speak
as you'd like,

24:00.424 --> 24:03.092
but I've been busting my ass
on this for two hours.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.827
So if you're not happy
with my progress,

24:04.894 --> 24:09.098
then why don't you
get the hell out?

24:09.165 --> 24:13.235
He doesn't leave
without getting it.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.507
Son of a bitch.

24:21.377 --> 24:23.411
You're not gonna pick it up?

24:23.479 --> 24:25.046
Why should I?
Never gonna get it.

24:25.114 --> 24:28.550
You're right.

24:28.617 --> 24:33.289
Hey, can I ask you something?

24:33.356 --> 24:37.660
What's your engine design
philosophy?

24:37.728 --> 24:39.996
Perfectly balanced
power and durability.

24:40.064 --> 24:44.033
Okay. Why don't you favor
power like Bronson does?

24:44.101 --> 24:46.035
Because drivers are limited
to eight engines a season,

24:46.103 --> 24:47.336
and Bronson's don't last.

24:47.404 --> 24:48.571
Well, so you would
stack your engines

24:48.638 --> 24:50.005
up against Bronson's, then?

24:50.073 --> 24:51.873
Uh, I have stacked
my engines up against Bronson

24:51.941 --> 24:53.341
and everyone else's
in the world,

24:53.409 --> 24:55.109
and mine win.
Why?

24:55.177 --> 24:56.544
Because I make sure

24:56.611 --> 24:58.746
they're designed better
than anyone else's in the world

24:58.813 --> 25:00.347
from the day
that they're conceived

25:00.415 --> 25:01.481
to the day they're born.

25:01.549 --> 25:02.783
And that's why people buy them.

25:02.850 --> 25:04.284
Goddamn right.

25:04.352 --> 25:06.386
And that's the speech
you're gonna give.

25:19.066 --> 25:20.800
Good lawyer, bad lawyer, baby.

25:20.868 --> 25:22.770
Worked like a charm.

25:22.837 --> 25:25.372
Come on.
You know you want it.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.208
There it is.
Told you.

25:27.276 --> 25:28.342
Someone doesn't like you,

25:28.410 --> 25:29.677
you use it against them.

25:29.745 --> 25:30.946
Or, in this case, for them.

25:31.013 --> 25:32.914
<i>I didn't do this for Dominic.</i>

25:32.982 --> 25:34.349
I did it
to get rid of Stensland.

25:34.417 --> 25:37.453
Wow. Have you ever considered
writing for hallmark?

25:37.521 --> 25:39.956
Many times. Yeah.

25:40.024 --> 25:42.826
Congrats.

25:42.893 --> 25:45.328
Looking good.

25:57.874 --> 25:58.774
Hey.

25:58.842 --> 25:59.975
I said don't be late.

26:00.043 --> 26:02.044
Late? I'm not late.

26:02.112 --> 26:03.913
When you host your dinner here,

26:03.980 --> 26:06.382
not being late means getting
here a half hour early.

26:06.449 --> 26:09.352
Aha. So what made you
change your mind?

26:09.419 --> 26:12.354
The food items are samples
to help you select your menu,

26:12.422 --> 26:16.659
so since I could never really
afford to eat here myself...

26:19.529 --> 26:21.196
Okay, start there.

26:21.264 --> 26:22.264
- Try that?
- Yes.

26:22.332 --> 26:23.231
It looks kind of funny.

26:23.299 --> 26:24.266
So does an egg roll.

26:24.333 --> 26:25.500
I don't accept that premise.

26:25.568 --> 26:27.369
You want my help or not?

26:34.909 --> 26:35.843
Ugh. What is that?

26:35.910 --> 26:37.044
Squid.

26:37.111 --> 26:40.913
I-- I think
it's still moving.

26:40.981 --> 26:44.883
That's what I'm talking about.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.487
I don't get it.

26:47.555 --> 26:49.422
How do you have no appreciation
for fine food?

26:49.490 --> 26:52.359
Mm. We didn't have a lot
of money growing up.

26:52.427 --> 26:53.961
I don't know.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.397
I guess I'm just comfortable
with what I'm comfortable with.

26:56.465 --> 26:58.333
That is the exact
opposite of me.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.669
I've-- I've always
loved new experiences.

27:00.736 --> 27:02.203
And your parents?

27:02.271 --> 27:03.739
They're loaded.

27:03.806 --> 27:07.376
Mm. So then what do you need
a free meal for?

27:07.443 --> 27:09.578
I want to live on what I make.

27:11.180 --> 27:13.481
- What?
- Nothing.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.416
I was just thinking about
Dominic for a second.

27:15.484 --> 27:18.619
And then I realized
this is the first time in weeks

27:18.686 --> 27:20.220
that I haven't been
thinking about work.

27:20.288 --> 27:22.122
That's what new
experiences do for you.

27:22.190 --> 27:26.259
Being a foodie doesn't mean
only liking fancy food.

27:26.326 --> 27:27.961
Means having
the courage to try it.

27:28.028 --> 27:30.129
And then you get to serve
what you like.

27:30.197 --> 27:31.864
Except strawberries, peanuts,

27:31.932 --> 27:33.066
gluten, and chicken.

27:33.133 --> 27:34.433
Okay, why not those things?

27:34.501 --> 27:36.135
Because Louis is an asshole.

27:36.202 --> 27:38.304
If you can't serve things
just 'cause Louis is an asshole,

27:38.372 --> 27:40.740
you're not gonna have
that many choices.

27:40.808 --> 27:41.741
Good point.

27:48.448 --> 27:52.351
So what really
made you change your mind?

27:52.419 --> 27:55.287
Pity.

27:55.355 --> 27:56.889
I'll take it.

28:07.668 --> 28:10.737
Driver, taketh me
to Williamsburg.

28:13.406 --> 28:14.407
It's Jenny.

28:14.474 --> 28:16.308
Trevor told me
you talked to him,

28:16.376 --> 28:17.810
and he's gonna stop.

28:17.878 --> 28:18.811
Thanks, Mike.

28:18.879 --> 28:19.979
Hold on.

28:20.046 --> 28:22.014
Change of destination.

28:24.819 --> 28:25.785
Trevor.

28:25.853 --> 28:28.087
What are you doing here?

28:28.155 --> 28:31.357
Can we talk for a minute?

28:31.425 --> 28:33.526
Yeah.

28:37.731 --> 28:40.866
I know you lied to Jenny
about us talking.

28:40.934 --> 28:42.034
You never should have told her

28:42.102 --> 28:43.503
I was dealing
in the first place.

28:43.571 --> 28:45.705
I never should have had
to hide it in the first place.

28:47.308 --> 28:50.911
Look, Trevor, you don't need
to be dealing for a living, man.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.679
You could make something
of yourself.

28:52.747 --> 28:53.880
Is that what
you came here to tell me?

28:53.948 --> 28:55.582
You've got real
software clients, man.

28:55.650 --> 28:56.650
Stick to them.

28:56.718 --> 28:58.886
Jeez.
You believe that crap?

28:58.953 --> 29:01.255
I don't have
any software clients.

29:01.322 --> 29:04.024
Jesus.
You're as naive as Jenny.

29:04.092 --> 29:05.526
Look...

29:05.593 --> 29:07.828
If you need some kind of
transition money or something--

29:07.896 --> 29:09.029
What? How?

29:09.097 --> 29:10.864
Does it matter?

29:10.932 --> 29:15.102
Look, what matters is that
you don't help me out, okay?

29:15.170 --> 29:16.103
I help you out.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.338
And I'm not interested

29:17.406 --> 29:19.574
in transitioning into anything.

29:19.642 --> 29:21.910
Okay.

29:21.978 --> 29:23.678
But the least you could do
is be honest with Jenny.

29:23.746 --> 29:24.980
That's what this is all about.

29:25.047 --> 29:26.281
- Yeah.
- You always liked her.

29:26.349 --> 29:29.584
I think she deserves
to know the truth.

29:29.652 --> 29:31.085
You always thought
you were better than me.

29:32.355 --> 29:34.089
Maybe that's because I am.

29:45.001 --> 29:49.039
Come on now.
All right?

29:57.649 --> 29:59.884
We're done.

29:59.952 --> 30:01.786
Don't let the door hit you--

30:13.288 --> 30:14.421
Call Dominic?

30:14.489 --> 30:16.089
He's waiting for us outside.

30:16.157 --> 30:17.424
He's got the speech down?

30:17.491 --> 30:18.892
Yeah, he's got it down.

30:18.959 --> 30:20.960
Better.
I'm taking a big risk on him.

30:21.028 --> 30:22.461
You're taking a risk on him?

30:22.529 --> 30:24.663
Look at him.

30:24.731 --> 30:26.131
He's scared out of his mind.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.500
He's leaving his comfort zone

30:27.567 --> 30:29.736
because you convinced him to.
So?

30:29.803 --> 30:32.439
So maybe some words
of encouragement.

30:32.506 --> 30:34.107
The best way to help Dominic

30:34.175 --> 30:35.943
is not to let him
second guess himself.

30:36.011 --> 30:38.613
The most important asset
an attorney has

30:38.680 --> 30:41.282
is his ability
to always be self-assured.

30:41.350 --> 30:43.919
Okay.
Here's what's gonna happen.

30:43.987 --> 30:45.621
It's standard for me
to prep the board

30:45.688 --> 30:46.789
on any voting procedure.

30:46.856 --> 30:48.324
When do I speak?

30:48.391 --> 30:51.093
When I tell you to.
Let's go.

30:54.964 --> 30:56.764
I suggested to Stensland
you be there

30:56.832 --> 30:58.633
to convince the board
the production won't be hurt

30:58.700 --> 30:59.800
by an overseas move.

30:59.868 --> 31:01.201
It helps your credibility

31:01.269 --> 31:02.569
that he brought you here,

31:02.637 --> 31:05.105
and it'll hurt his when
you challenge him for CEO.

31:09.110 --> 31:11.712
Look, it's natural
to be nervous, okay?

31:11.780 --> 31:13.381
Just remember,
you know your stuff.

31:13.448 --> 31:14.682
The board's never
loved Stensland,

31:14.750 --> 31:16.050
and I'm here to back you up.

31:16.118 --> 31:17.885
Okay.

31:26.095 --> 31:27.930
Robert.

31:27.997 --> 31:30.632
Harvey.

31:30.700 --> 31:31.600
You know, I have to admit,

31:31.668 --> 31:32.868
I almost didn't see it coming.

31:32.935 --> 31:34.302
Excuse me?

31:34.370 --> 31:35.670
It was the delay
in the due diligence.

31:35.738 --> 31:37.105
It just didn't smell right.

31:37.173 --> 31:38.706
So the only thing it could be

31:38.774 --> 31:42.109
was that you were going after
my CEO appointment.

31:42.177 --> 31:44.444
So since I'm still within my
rights to move a board meeting,

31:44.512 --> 31:45.579
I did.

31:45.646 --> 31:48.214
I was voted in today at noon.

31:48.282 --> 31:51.084
And tomorrow the board will
ratify the sale of the factory.

31:51.152 --> 31:55.389
And now I'm firing your firm.

31:55.457 --> 31:58.492
And I'm firing you.

31:58.560 --> 32:00.661
Try the croissant, gentlemen.

32:00.728 --> 32:02.863
Marmalade's fantastic.

32:12.875 --> 32:14.276
What are we gonna do?

32:14.344 --> 32:15.845
You're gonna go through
those bylaws again,

32:15.913 --> 32:17.113
and see if there isn't
another way

32:17.180 --> 32:18.381
we can stop this sale.

32:18.449 --> 32:19.382
I'm talking about Dominic.

32:19.450 --> 32:20.684
He just lost his job.

32:20.752 --> 32:22.719
He's a grown man.
He made a decision.

32:22.787 --> 32:24.355
Because you convinced him to.

32:24.422 --> 32:25.623
Based on your idea,

32:25.691 --> 32:27.392
which I recall
you pushed on me at the time.

32:27.459 --> 32:29.493
Because I thought
it would work at the time.

32:29.561 --> 32:30.594
Well, it didn't. What do you
want me to do about it?

32:30.662 --> 32:32.863
Help him.

32:32.931 --> 32:34.131
He's not dying.
He lost his job.

32:34.199 --> 32:35.533
He has to look for another one.

32:35.600 --> 32:36.868
Which, if he hadn't chosen

32:36.935 --> 32:37.935
to fight for his company
in the first place,

32:38.003 --> 32:39.037
would have happened anyway.

32:39.104 --> 32:40.605
Now, show me that you get it,

32:40.673 --> 32:42.173
go back through
those bylaws again,

32:42.241 --> 32:44.709
and see if you missed anything.
Okay?

32:47.714 --> 32:49.648
So this is what happens
when you promote the wrong guy

32:49.715 --> 32:51.082
to senior partner.

32:51.150 --> 32:52.484
If you hadn't gone
to Stensland behind my back,

32:52.551 --> 32:54.419
this wouldn't have happened.
You don't know that.

32:54.486 --> 32:56.054
And I'm a member of this firm
just as much of you.

32:56.122 --> 32:57.222
Oh, I think we both agree
that you're a member.

32:57.289 --> 32:59.424
For your information,
I didn't even--

32:59.492 --> 33:01.793
Louis.
Harvey, eye on the ball.

33:01.861 --> 33:04.729
The issue here is you tried
to torpedo a client--

33:04.797 --> 33:07.131
The client is McKernon Motors,
not Stensland.

33:07.199 --> 33:08.399
You didn't let me finish.

33:08.467 --> 33:10.835
Without my consent.

33:10.903 --> 33:13.571
That trumps
the "who's the client" part.

33:13.639 --> 33:16.541
Louis, go to Stensland,
repair the relationship.

33:16.608 --> 33:19.110
Say what you have to.
Call it a misunderstanding.

33:19.178 --> 33:22.413
Promise Harvey
is no longer involved.

33:22.481 --> 33:24.615
Consider it done.

33:28.053 --> 33:29.620
Wait a second.

33:29.688 --> 33:31.789
Louis didn't go to Stensland
behind my back.

33:31.856 --> 33:34.525
You send him there
to hedge your bets.

33:34.592 --> 33:38.762
Either stensland's out
and we double our billings,

33:38.829 --> 33:40.697
or you have plausible
deniability,

33:40.765 --> 33:43.032
and he stays with the firm.

33:43.100 --> 33:46.935
Wow. Am I smart enough
to do that?

33:47.003 --> 33:48.403
If I win, I look great.

33:48.471 --> 33:50.972
If Louis wins, he looks great.

33:51.040 --> 33:54.676
Either way...
You look great.

33:54.744 --> 33:57.346
You mean the firm looks great.

33:57.413 --> 33:59.148
Harvey, what I've been trying
to get into your head

33:59.215 --> 34:01.016
is that you bought in.

34:01.083 --> 34:03.118
You are the firm.

34:05.754 --> 34:07.455
That's it.

34:10.393 --> 34:11.760
Mike, follow me.

34:11.828 --> 34:13.362
I need you
to go talk to Dominic.

34:13.429 --> 34:16.165
What? Why?
Stensland's already CEO.

34:16.233 --> 34:18.333
That won't matter
if we just buy the damn company.

34:18.402 --> 34:22.572
What?

34:22.639 --> 34:26.976
Why are you still working?

34:27.045 --> 34:28.645
It's one of my creations.

34:28.713 --> 34:31.614
I'm not leaving it unfinished.

34:31.681 --> 34:33.984
What the hell do you want?

34:34.051 --> 34:36.085
I'd be happy to tell you
if you put that wrench down.

34:36.152 --> 34:37.219
Yeah, you're quick
with the jokes.

34:37.286 --> 34:39.855
I'm the guy who just got fired.

34:39.922 --> 34:43.125
You're right. I'm sorry.

34:43.192 --> 34:45.127
What would you say
if I told you

34:45.194 --> 34:47.529
we could get your job back
and stick it to Stensland.

34:47.597 --> 34:49.398
I'm done with Harvey
and his plans, yeah?

34:49.466 --> 34:50.998
You were there.
We got fired too.

34:51.067 --> 34:52.467
You and Harvey still have jobs?

34:52.536 --> 34:55.804
He doesn't care
about anybody but himself,

34:55.873 --> 34:57.407
including you, Mike.

34:57.475 --> 35:01.578
Yeah.
You're probably right.

35:01.646 --> 35:05.049
But he did stick his neck out
to keep your company here,

35:05.116 --> 35:07.885
and he does have an idea
that requires your help,

35:07.953 --> 35:11.021
so you can stay here
and call him an asshole,

35:11.089 --> 35:13.423
or you can come with me
and we can help him.

35:17.628 --> 35:20.096
Give me my goddamn shirt.

35:33.718 --> 35:35.352
You know,
it goes from 0 to 60--

35:35.420 --> 35:39.989
In the blink of an eye.

35:40.057 --> 35:42.625
Did you bring me down here
to tell me I can drive this?

35:42.693 --> 35:43.794
Better.

35:43.861 --> 35:46.729
For $250 million,
you can own it.

35:46.797 --> 35:48.865
McKernon Motors is for sale?

35:48.933 --> 35:50.634
If we act fast.

35:50.702 --> 35:52.002
I'll need
to see the financials.

35:52.070 --> 35:53.537
You put together
a letter of intent,

35:53.605 --> 35:54.906
they'll get you the financials.

35:54.974 --> 35:57.776
You know, their real asset
is engine quality.

35:57.844 --> 35:59.411
I don't want
to just buy the name.

35:59.479 --> 36:00.980
Speak of the devil.

36:01.048 --> 36:03.249
Laurence, I'd like you
to meet the man responsible

36:03.317 --> 36:04.984
for every McKernon Motors
engine ever built.

36:05.052 --> 36:06.719
Wow. Dominic Barone.
Very nice to meet you.

36:06.787 --> 36:08.187
Good to meet you.

36:08.255 --> 36:10.056
I'd like to show you something
if you have a minute.

36:10.123 --> 36:13.159
Absolutely.

36:13.226 --> 36:15.227
So how do we get an offer
to the board

36:15.295 --> 36:18.030
before they vote to ratify
the deal tomorrow?

36:18.098 --> 36:19.632
You're gonna
go through those bylaws,

36:19.699 --> 36:21.100
and you're gonna
figure something out.

36:21.168 --> 36:22.935
I don't have to look through
them to figure it out,

36:23.002 --> 36:23.902
because I just did.

36:23.970 --> 36:25.237
Well, what took you so long?

36:25.305 --> 36:27.907
You trying to look like me?

36:32.846 --> 36:34.414
Each of you have 24 hours

36:34.482 --> 36:36.083
to review the documents
in front of you,

36:36.150 --> 36:37.651
so at this time...

36:37.719 --> 36:39.052
Uh, excuse me.
Excuse me.

36:39.120 --> 36:41.288
What is he doing here?

36:41.356 --> 36:42.757
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna take care of this.

36:42.824 --> 36:44.158
No, no, I will.

36:44.226 --> 36:46.293
You gentlemen have no right
to attend this meeting.

36:46.361 --> 36:47.594
Actually, we do.

36:47.662 --> 36:50.096
The bylaw states
that any original employee

36:50.164 --> 36:51.397
has the right
to petition the board

36:51.465 --> 36:52.999
any time they meet.

36:53.067 --> 36:55.668
Dominic Barone
has assigned that right to me.

36:55.735 --> 36:57.236
He was fired.

36:57.303 --> 36:58.770
He no longer has that right.

36:58.838 --> 37:01.340
Per section 17-5, point "C,"

37:01.407 --> 37:03.008
Dominic wasn't given
three days' notice,

37:03.076 --> 37:05.544
so technically he wasn't fired.

37:05.612 --> 37:07.246
Which is why
I do have the right

37:07.314 --> 37:09.349
to urge the board
to accept the offer

37:09.416 --> 37:11.217
for the purchase
of McKernon Motors.

37:11.285 --> 37:13.353
Now, I can tell you
that this offer

37:13.421 --> 37:15.556
will keep manufacturing here
and save jobs

37:15.623 --> 37:17.591
while retaining
the flagship engine

37:17.659 --> 37:19.093
that put this company
on the map,

37:19.161 --> 37:21.462
but I don't have to,
because it happens to be

37:21.530 --> 37:23.031
for way more goddamn money

37:23.098 --> 37:26.233
than the one
in front of you right now.

37:26.301 --> 37:28.869
Hey, Bob.
How are ya?

37:31.038 --> 37:32.706
It's funny
how you held out on me

37:32.773 --> 37:34.407
on that proper
notice exception.

37:34.475 --> 37:35.408
I didn't hold out.

37:35.476 --> 37:36.943
I made that up on the spot.

37:37.011 --> 37:38.478
Really? On the spot?

37:38.546 --> 37:40.013
Remember that
getting it stuff--

37:40.081 --> 37:41.414
I know, right?
I'm getting it.

37:41.482 --> 37:43.950
Well, I was gonna say that,
but now you ruined it.

37:44.017 --> 37:46.619
That's one thing
you definitely get.

37:46.687 --> 37:49.322
How to ruin it.

37:49.390 --> 37:50.623
How to ruin it?

37:50.691 --> 37:54.060
I heard that.

38:05.340 --> 38:07.975
I have to admit,
you don't suck.

38:08.043 --> 38:10.245
I wish I could say
the same for you.

38:13.249 --> 38:15.551
Time to pay the Piper.

38:15.618 --> 38:17.186
Just so you know,
I took the liberty

38:17.254 --> 38:19.756
of ordering some
really expensive wines.

38:19.823 --> 38:21.391
Hope that's okay.

38:32.703 --> 38:34.905
Sorry, sir, but the check's
been paid for in full

38:34.973 --> 38:36.807
by a Harvey Specter.

38:41.245 --> 38:43.579
There, uh, might have been
some gluten in the ravioli.

38:50.253 --> 38:52.654
I hear McKernon Motors
is getting a new owner.

38:52.721 --> 38:54.455
We're not only
handling the sale,

38:54.523 --> 38:56.690
but with the expansion plan
they're putting in place,

38:56.758 --> 38:58.059
our billables should double.

38:58.126 --> 38:59.627
Nicely done.

38:59.694 --> 39:02.896
I did it for the firm.

39:11.039 --> 39:15.907
♪ it's a perfect day
to turn away and run ♪

39:29.860 --> 39:34.397
What are you doing here?

39:34.465 --> 39:35.799
You were right.

39:35.866 --> 39:37.234
I should never
have kept it from you

39:37.302 --> 39:40.772
that Trevor was dealing
all that time.

39:40.839 --> 39:45.810
Well, I mean, it's, uh...

39:45.878 --> 39:49.347
It's all in the past, right?

39:49.415 --> 39:52.050
No.

39:52.118 --> 39:55.720
What are you talking about?

39:55.787 --> 40:01.225
He's lying to you.

40:01.293 --> 40:03.260
He's still dealing.

40:03.328 --> 40:05.596
And I'm done with him.

40:13.704 --> 40:15.905
Son of a bitch.

40:18.475 --> 40:20.776
Well, thank you, uh,
for telling me.

40:20.844 --> 40:24.814
No, don't. Stop.

40:24.882 --> 40:26.783
We're even.

40:26.851 --> 40:31.187
And that is the last time
I am ever ratting on anyone.

40:31.255 --> 40:35.759
So if you fall for it again...

40:35.826 --> 40:38.929
It's on you.

40:38.997 --> 40:43.200
Are you angry with me?

40:43.268 --> 40:44.969
You told me
he would listen to me.

40:45.036 --> 40:47.171
- I thought he would.
- Well, he didn't.

40:47.239 --> 40:49.007
I...

40:49.075 --> 40:51.510
I'm sorry.

40:51.578 --> 40:53.979
I'm s-- I'm sorry.

41:01.789 --> 41:02.856
No, I can't.

41:02.923 --> 41:03.990
I can't.

41:04.058 --> 41:05.091
What?

41:05.159 --> 41:08.661
No, I-- I fought with him.

41:08.728 --> 41:10.596
Oh, God.

41:10.663 --> 41:14.099
This is too much.

41:14.166 --> 41:15.467
Oh, my God.
