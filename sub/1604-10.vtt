Lab tests confirm

38:39.984 --> 38:41.394
the blood was Reddington's.

Reddington does.
Don't know that.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.248
We have a mole.

38:57.460 --> 39:01.169
That mole leaked intel leading to the
abduction and torture of Reddington.

39:01.381 --> 39:05.215
It's a simple math problem,
Harold. Whoever is after
Reddington is after us.

39:05.426 --> 39:09.590
And that means, as far as I'm concerned,
that Reddington still has real value.

39:09.806 --> 39:13.424
The unit has new focus: Finding him.
