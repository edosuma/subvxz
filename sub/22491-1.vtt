00:03.969 --> 00:06.131
Previously on Robot Chicken.

00:06.172 --> 00:08.470
Please welcome
our special guest tonight...

00:08.508 --> 00:10.772
Vice President of Adult Swim
Keith Crofford.

00:10.810 --> 00:13.802
Y'all are doing
a really good job on Robot Chicken.

00:13.847 --> 00:17.374
That's great! So when are we getting
renewed for another season?

00:17.417 --> 00:19.317
I don't know.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.747
You're canceled.

00:27.894 --> 00:31.022
Hi, y'all.
I'm Adult Swim president Mike Lazzo.

00:31.064 --> 00:34.659
The decision of the council
is now fixin' to be heard.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.168
Guilty.

00:36.202 --> 00:39.137
- Guilty.
- You're so friggin' guilty.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

00:54.521 --> 00:57.490
- I think we hit something.
- Damn it, damn it, damn it!

00:59.859 --> 01:02.384
Hey, Seth.
What happened to you?

01:02.429 --> 01:04.294
I don't know.

01:06.866 --> 01:08.800
You're renewed.

01:26.119 --> 01:28.713
It's alive!

01:51.044 --> 01:52.443
Damn it!

01:55.915 --> 02:00.079
Thank you, Zaxxon.
Hello, Centipede.

02:00.487 --> 02:06.517
I pledge allegiance to the hag
of the United States of fart.

02:06.559 --> 02:08.424
Is this your child?

02:08.461 --> 02:10.691
He may think saying "fart" is funny...

02:10.729 --> 02:15.827
but by disrespecting America,
he's encouraging terrorism!

02:15.869 --> 02:19.566
Even now, our enemies are searching
for signs of weakness in our great land.

02:25.545 --> 02:28.139
I was just trying to be funny.

02:28.181 --> 02:29.978
America loves a joke...

02:30.016 --> 02:33.452
but not when the punch line is terrorism.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.319
I only put on 49 stars.

02:37.390 --> 02:39.221
Terrorism.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.226
We just voted democrat!

02:44.164 --> 02:47.600
Time to light the Chanukah Menorah, kids.

02:49.903 --> 02:53.361
- What about The Core?
- Could be good.

02:57.477 --> 03:01.436
Thank you for watching
our latest homeland security video.

03:01.481 --> 03:04.917
We will be replacing
the color-coded terrorist alert system...

03:04.951 --> 03:07.818
with one that uses rubber duckies.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.288
This one symbolizes "all clear".

03:10.323 --> 03:13.053
His name is Englebert.

03:13.459 --> 03:16.986
Third one this week.
I'm gonna get this bastard!

03:17.397 --> 03:20.560
Come on, honey.
One more push. Big push.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.700
You... whore.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.905
Pablo Rodriguez. Test pilot.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.102
A Mexican barely alive.

03:30.944 --> 03:35.176
Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.
We have the technology.

03:35.215 --> 03:40.517
We have the capability to build
the world's first bionic Mexican.

03:42.622 --> 03:44.351
Better than he was before.

03:45.925 --> 03:49.190
Better, stronger, faster.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.994
Seis Million Peso Man,
your country needs you.

03:55.034 --> 03:56.695
Are you ready for your mission?

04:10.750 --> 04:14.516
There's 283 American dollars
we won't see again.

04:16.189 --> 04:20.649
Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone.

04:23.963 --> 04:25.089
Blammo!

04:25.498 --> 04:27.489
Two scoops!

04:38.645 --> 04:40.408
You tweaker.

04:40.446 --> 04:44.177
The best part was when you hit
your nuts on that tombstone.

04:46.152 --> 04:47.346
Who are you?

04:47.387 --> 04:49.821
I am Skater McGee...

04:49.856 --> 04:52.518
the best skateboarder
in all of Western Ohio.

04:52.558 --> 04:55.493
- At least, I was.
- What happened?

04:55.528 --> 04:58.986
I died attempting
the Monster Cookie Pinwheel...

04:59.032 --> 05:01.227
the hardest trick
in skateboard history.

05:01.267 --> 05:05.601
- No way!
- Yes! As a matter of fact, way!

05:06.639 --> 05:10.302
Pay close attention.
Skater McGee does not repeat himself.

05:10.343 --> 05:13.938
- What'd you say?
- I said, "Skater McGee does not... "

05:16.349 --> 05:18.044
The Monster Cookie Pinwheel...

05:18.084 --> 05:21.417
is when you skate up the front
of the locomotive's cowcatcher...

05:21.454 --> 05:23.479
360 punk-buster to the second car...

05:23.523 --> 05:25.787
hit a lemonade handstand
on the third car...

05:25.825 --> 05:29.659
a whipping post ollie to the fourth car.
A demon stomper on the fifth car...

05:29.696 --> 05:33.291
and a gleaming the cube off the sixth car,
before dismounting the train.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.891
I failed hideously...

05:34.934 --> 05:37.528
but it's not too late
for you young gentlemen...

05:37.570 --> 05:39.504
to become gods of skateboarding.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.268
Oh, yeah!

05:41.307 --> 05:44.242
Monster Cookie Pinwheel!
Monster Cookie...

05:46.746 --> 05:49.442
Thank you for getting rid
of those skateboarders.

05:49.482 --> 05:52.645
- They were ruining our cemetery.
- You're welcome, Mr. Mayor.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.744
They don't call me
Skater McGee for nothing.

05:54.787 --> 05:55.811
What will you do now?

05:55.855 --> 05:58.517
I'm going on to the next town
to kill more teenagers.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.958
You're doing God's work,
Skater McGee.

06:02.962 --> 06:06.363
- Hey, Paul. Didn't see you there.
- Hey, Frank.

06:06.399 --> 06:08.264
It's a hell of a pounding
we're taking today.

06:08.301 --> 06:11.361
Tell me about it. Getting our asses
handed to us on a silver platter.

06:11.404 --> 06:13.929
- I know.
- There goes Carl.

06:13.973 --> 06:15.736
He had two kids, right?

06:15.775 --> 06:17.970
Three, boy and two girls.
I'm their godfather.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.443
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

06:19.479 --> 06:22.676
There goes Gene in his UFO again.
Big help he is.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.979
Did you know
he has his own mini-fridge in there?

06:25.017 --> 06:27.781
- What?! What a dick.
- Tell me about it.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.117
Jeez!

06:30.823 --> 06:32.313
- Frank?
- Yeah.

06:32.358 --> 06:34.485
- I'm going in.
- Paul, that's crazy talk.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.620
I don't care. I'm not gonna die this way.

06:36.662 --> 06:37.720
- Paul?
- Yeah.

06:37.764 --> 06:41.097
- You go, I go. I'm coming with you.
- I love you, man.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.227
- Back at you.
- For glory!

06:45.037 --> 06:46.698
- We did it!
- We won!

06:46.739 --> 06:48.604
- We did it.
- Wait, wait.

06:48.641 --> 06:53.101
Our alien bodies can't handle
the strange bacteria here.

06:53.146 --> 06:57.082
- We're dying!
- Oh, my God, Paul! Really?

06:57.116 --> 06:59.641
No. Don't be stupid.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.243
- You!
- I did it!

07:02.288 --> 07:03.277
- Yeah.
- It's me.

07:03.322 --> 07:05.187
- You got me again.
- I got you.

07:05.525 --> 07:11.555
So TARDIS stands for
"Time and Relative Dimensions in Space. "

07:11.597 --> 07:13.531
Nerd!

07:18.337 --> 07:20.771
So, where you from?

07:21.974 --> 07:24.943
Man, I wish unicorns were real.

07:24.977 --> 07:27.104
That would be so cool.

07:29.148 --> 07:31.981
So... cool.

07:36.522 --> 07:40.014
Oh, my gosh!
They do exist!

07:40.059 --> 07:43.961
Come with me.
Let's have fun adventures together!

07:43.996 --> 07:46.328
You don't have to ask me twice.

07:48.835 --> 07:51.395
It's everything I've ever dreamed!

07:52.939 --> 07:55.840
In the magical land of unicorns...

07:55.875 --> 07:58.070
there's no need for clothing.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.977
- Whatever you say!
- No, no, no.

08:01.013 --> 08:03.811
Take it off slowly. Yes.

08:03.850 --> 08:06.512
That pleases me.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.645
- Polish my magic horn.
- OK.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.760
And then what happened?

08:18.798 --> 08:21.266
If you polish a unicorn horn long enough...

08:21.300 --> 08:24.394
it gives you magical unicorn mayonnaise.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.997
That's what I used to make
these sandwiches.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.499
I'll take some oranges, amigo.

08:45.391 --> 08:48.519
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

08:48.561 --> 08:52.156
¤ That's the way they all became
The Brady Bunch ¤

08:52.198 --> 08:57.898
All lies. The perfect family
was really the perfect cover.

08:58.838 --> 09:01.602
- This tastes different today.
- Alice added pee.

09:01.641 --> 09:03.074
Peas.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.957
I was a housewife with a maid.

09:23.996 --> 09:27.261
Took you this long to figure out
what I was doing all day?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.928
Like I cared about you
and the rent-a-kids anyway.

09:29.969 --> 09:33.336
Here's a better story
of a bloody lady who's dead!

09:33.372 --> 09:35.431
Who's fucking dead.

09:35.474 --> 09:38.739
Is that the door? I'm waiting
for Davy Jones to answer my letter.

09:38.778 --> 09:40.245
My nose!

09:41.080 --> 09:44.948
Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!
How come she gets blown up and I don...?

09:46.953 --> 09:50.354
Mommy, Kitty Karry-all
says lips are cute...

09:50.389 --> 09:53.187
and recommends corrective surgery.

09:56.162 --> 09:59.427
No. We wouldn't go to hell
because she's not really our sister.

09:59.465 --> 10:01.456
So these feelings are natural?

10:04.704 --> 10:06.433
No!

10:06.472 --> 10:08.269
Damn you, Tiki idol!

10:40.139 --> 10:42.073
Well, I guess someone liked my peas.

10:42.108 --> 10:44.201
Ask us the sex question.

10:44.243 --> 10:48.270
Now that the kids are gone,
the sex has never been better.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.508
I agree.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.056
All right, Keith, get your ass in here.
