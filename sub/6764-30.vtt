02:18.605 --> 02:20.766
Jesse,
you're supposed to be studying.

02:21.774 --> 02:23.571
I was taking a break.

02:23.743 --> 02:26.075
Looks more like a full shift to me.

02:26.246 --> 02:29.682
Sorry, I got carried away.

02:29.849 --> 02:31.544
Jesse, you have weeks
to finish that cradle.

02:31.718 --> 02:34.118
Your law finals are now.
You gotta hit your books, counselor.

02:34.287 --> 02:37.950
All right, all right. The defense rests.

02:38.958 --> 02:41.756
Hey, you been crying?

02:41.928 --> 02:43.691
No.

02:43.863 --> 02:46.764
Just having
that same old nightmare.

02:47.066 --> 02:48.795
I'm glad the alarm went off
for my 3:00 pill.

02:48.968 --> 02:50.060
At least it was over fast.

02:50.937 --> 02:55.931
- Same dream?
- I don't know. I mean, it was worse.

02:56.609 --> 02:58.770
This time I'm in a forest.

02:58.945 --> 03:03.712
I keep hearing this baby
crying and crying.

03:03.883 --> 03:07.842
And I was looking everywhere for it,
but just like all the other dreams,

03:08.021 --> 03:11.582
the baby can't be found anywhere,
and all I hear is crying.

03:11.758 --> 03:15.125
Come on, come on,
don't read so much into it.

03:15.295 --> 03:18.264
Yeah. Look, I'm gonna be fine.

03:18.431 --> 03:20.331
After three weeks of bed rest

03:20.500 --> 03:22.434
and taking those damn pills
every four hours,

03:22.602 --> 03:24.627
I'm not gonna let any nightmares
get to me.

03:24.804 --> 03:26.396
That's what I wanna hear.

03:26.573 --> 03:29.337
And who knows, we go for
a second opinion tomorrow,

03:29.509 --> 03:31.807
maybe the new doctor
will take you off those damn pills.

03:32.712 --> 03:36.045
Besides,
if our child was lost in the woods,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.446
I'd be right there searching with you.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.819
I know you would.

04:13.720 --> 04:14.744
Jim, here it is,

04:14.921 --> 04:19.324
<i>in the L.A. Times calendar section,
under the "Best of the Weekend. "</i>

04:19.492 --> 04:21.187
Hey, that's impressive.

04:21.361 --> 04:25.195
<i>"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, tonight at 8,
directed by Roy Randolph,</i>

04:25.365 --> 04:27.629
starring Brenda Walsh as Maggie. "

04:28.901 --> 04:30.926
Oh, my God,
why am I getting nervous?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.196
Just don't tell Brenda.

04:32.372 --> 04:35.068
Well, I see you finally
got yourself a maid, Mom.

04:35.241 --> 04:37.539
Well, he's making up
for being out of town on Mother's Day.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.235
Always leave it to the accountant
to balance his books.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.779
- Fry on, big Daddy.
- Hey, there's plenty for you.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.543
No, that's all right, I gotta go pick up
the task force handbooks.

04:45.718 --> 04:47.208
They should be
finished with them now.

04:47.387 --> 04:49.287
I wanna get them
over to the chancellor's office.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.787
- I'll catch you at the theater.
- Don't be late.

04:52.492 --> 04:55.586
Now, would I do
something like that?

04:56.229 --> 04:58.094
You're gonna be great.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.054
Bye, guys.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.895
Well, one daughter
starring on the stage,

05:03.069 --> 05:05.003
son going off to Washington
to meet the president,

05:05.171 --> 05:06.468
we must be doing something right.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.267
Well, I'll let you know
as soon as I've tasted your omelet.

05:09.442 --> 05:11.672
Honey, it's your opening night.
You should have slept in.

05:11.844 --> 05:12.936
No, I'm fine.

05:13.112 --> 05:14.943
You know,
I figure after a month of rehearsals,

05:15.114 --> 05:17.048
when the curtain goes up,
Maggie will be there.

05:17.216 --> 05:18.808
Well, you should know.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.885
Oh, I got the whole ticket mess
straightened out.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.851
You guys will be sitting
with Donna and David.

05:23.022 --> 05:24.512
- Oh, that's good.
- Yeah, it is.

05:24.691 --> 05:27.785
Steve never went to go pick up his
free ticket, so I had something to trade.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.554
- Steve's not going?
- I offered, he declined.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.698
That's his problem.
I have a show to do.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.298
Dylan.

05:40.039 --> 05:42.166
Dylan, are you asleep?

05:42.342 --> 05:44.435
Dylan, wake up.

05:44.610 --> 05:47.204
- Erica?
- Sorry, Kelly.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.711
This is an emergency.

05:48.881 --> 05:50.906
- What's going on?
- We're moving.

05:51.684 --> 05:52.878
What?

05:53.052 --> 05:54.644
I'm not supposed to know.

05:54.821 --> 05:57.688
But yesterday when Mom and Kevin
thought I was outside playing,

05:57.857 --> 05:59.347
I heard them.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.425
They said we were moving
to South America.

06:03.396 --> 06:05.057
No, that can't be right.

06:05.231 --> 06:06.289
Talk to them.

06:06.466 --> 06:08.525
Okay, give me the phone.
I'll call them right now.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.999
You don't have to.
They're just outside in the living room.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.400
They're outside in the living room?

06:13.740 --> 06:16.903
Okay, you go on, go ahead.
I'll be out in a second.

06:17.343 --> 06:18.810
Okay.

06:20.246 --> 06:24.376
She could have just as easily come in
when we were making love.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.383
Just let me deal with this first, okay?

06:30.623 --> 06:33.114
Let me tell you, these have
pump up ones with the heels.

06:33.292 --> 06:35.192
- Big pump up ones with heels.
- Good morning.

06:35.361 --> 06:36.885
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- All right.

06:37.063 --> 06:40.590
Believe me, we are sorry to bother you,
but Erica insisted we stop by.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.564
She's getting new sneakers today

06:42.735 --> 06:45.169
and says you're the only one
who knows the right kind.

06:45.938 --> 06:48.304
Well, it would seem
that traveling shoes may be in order,

06:48.474 --> 06:51.307
as I hear a rumor that you guys
are moving to South America?

06:51.477 --> 06:54.310
- What?
- Boy, something's screwy here.

06:54.480 --> 06:58.541
- But I heard you talking.
- You should have just asked me.

06:58.718 --> 07:02.484
We have been talking about
maybe relocating for Kevin's business,

07:02.655 --> 07:06.557
but to the Southwest,
not to South America.

07:06.726 --> 07:10.719
Yeah, sweetie, the furthest we ever
talked about going was Arizona.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.558
I told you we were moving.

07:12.732 --> 07:15.394
Kevin, what happened
to the company in Irvine you talked to?

07:15.568 --> 07:17.001
They were interested, but I realized

07:17.170 --> 07:19.536
I'd just be getting back
on the same corporate treadmill.

07:20.039 --> 07:23.236
No, if this thing is gonna work,
I have gotta set up my own shop.

07:23.409 --> 07:25.001
I hear you,
I'd just hate to see you go.

07:25.178 --> 07:28.011
Me too, but unfortunately,
most of the investors I've talked to

07:28.181 --> 07:30.741
do not wanna start up
a new business venture in L.A.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.444
But I don't wanna leave Dylan.

07:32.618 --> 07:36.486
Oh, neither do I,
but whatever has to be has to be.

07:37.023 --> 07:38.786
Arizona's not that far.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.289
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi, Kelly.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.518
Hi, guys.

07:41.694 --> 07:43.787
I was just coming by
to pick some stuff up,

07:43.963 --> 07:45.726
and now I'm leaving.

07:45.898 --> 07:47.297
Okay.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.434
I still think
you should be with Brenda.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.616
- Pass. Next one.
- David.

08:04.784 --> 08:07.753
Donna, it's not right for the C.U.
Mardi Gras. You can't dance to it.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.649
At least let me play one
all the way through.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.791
Look, the Inter-Greek Council chose
me to be entertainment chairman

08:12.959 --> 08:14.290
because they trust my taste.

08:14.460 --> 08:18.191
Okay, fine. Look, I'm just trying
to speed things up here.

08:18.731 --> 08:21.564
Why don't you give me the group list?
Maybe we can narrow things down.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.859
Okay, but don't tell me they all suck,

08:24.036 --> 08:26.470
because I have
to line someone up, okay?

08:32.578 --> 08:35.445
Here we go, 200 task force
handbooks hot off the presses.

08:35.615 --> 08:36.639
Can I take them inside?

08:36.816 --> 08:40.251
No, no, just leave them here.
I'll distribute them.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.683
- Okay.
- Don't forget yours.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.482
Thanks.

08:45.992 --> 08:50.019
Oh, look, here's the foreword you did.
You must be very proud.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.221
Yeah, it's pretty good.

08:52.398 --> 08:54.798
I used the condor
as an image for public education.

08:54.967 --> 08:56.400
Both are nearly extinct.

08:57.837 --> 09:00.465
- Well, everything looks together.
- No, not quite.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.471
Right here on page 3, here's a goof.

09:02.642 --> 09:05.736
My name's not on the list of delegates
traveling to Washington.

09:05.912 --> 09:06.936
Who did the final proof?

09:07.113 --> 09:09.104
Well,
Chancellor Arnold did it himself

09:09.282 --> 09:12.649
right before he left with Clare
for Europe.

09:13.953 --> 09:16.319
Well, it must be
some kind of oversight, huh?

09:16.489 --> 09:17.649
You better ask him yourself.

09:18.524 --> 09:19.855
Okay, I'll just be a minute.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.119
Hold on, Brandon.

09:22.295 --> 09:25.321
He explicitly said
he didn't wanna be disturbed.

09:25.498 --> 09:28.160
Oh, all right, forget it.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.894
It's probably
just some kind of mistake, right?

09:38.511 --> 09:41.639
- I'm sorry I kept you waiting so long.
- It's all right. Thank you, Dr. Gordon.

09:41.814 --> 09:43.441
I'm just glad to be out of bed.

09:43.616 --> 09:46.050
Good. I'm glad your spirits are up.

09:46.218 --> 09:50.052
Now, I've been going
over the results of the tests we ran.

09:50.222 --> 09:52.713
- I've been taking my pills faithfully.
- I understand.

09:52.892 --> 09:55.224
But as far as controlling
your preterm labor is concerned,

09:55.394 --> 09:57.954
I'm afraid the pills aren't working
as well as we'd hoped.

09:58.130 --> 10:02.191
And your pelvic exams shows
that you've dilated another centimeter.

10:02.368 --> 10:03.562
How can that be?

10:03.736 --> 10:07.035
But what's more disturbing
is the ultrasound.

10:07.206 --> 10:10.869
There's evidence now
of a serious excess of amniotic fluid.

10:11.043 --> 10:13.170
Is that why I've been so swollen?

10:13.346 --> 10:16.577
Yes, and it probably caused
your preterm contractions as well.

10:16.749 --> 10:19.047
- Just how serious is it?
- It's very serious.

10:19.218 --> 10:23.746
I'd have to say that in the last week,
the condition has become dangerous.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.285
Dangerous for the health
of your child.

10:28.094 --> 10:31.655
I'm sorry,
but I think it's now highly unlikely

10:31.831 --> 10:33.890
that you'll be able
to carry your baby to term.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.632
It will almost certainly
have to be delivered in a few weeks.

10:37.803 --> 10:38.827
Maybe a few days.

10:39.005 --> 10:43.271
- Days?
- I'm only 27 weeks pregnant.

10:43.442 --> 10:46.309
That's why my first recommendation
is for you to check in to the hospital

10:46.479 --> 10:48.174
as soon as possible,
maybe even tonight,

10:48.347 --> 10:51.339
so that we can monitor both you
and the baby.

10:51.517 --> 10:55.248
We have to try to prolong this
pregnancy as long as we possibly can.

10:55.421 --> 10:58.083
In this situation,
even one additional week

10:58.257 --> 11:01.090
can make the difference
in the health of your baby.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.995
Tonight we were supposed to start
our Lamaze classes.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.394
I understand that this
must seem all very sudden to you.

11:07.566 --> 11:10.228
But the last thing we need
is for your water to break

11:10.403 --> 11:12.530
and force our hand.

11:12.705 --> 11:16.141
Dr. Gordon, you said it was highly
unlikely that Andrea would go full term,

11:16.308 --> 11:18.640
but there is a chance she could
with hospital care, right?

11:18.811 --> 11:20.210
There are always miracles.

11:20.379 --> 11:24.110
But you both need to know
and be prepared for the fact

11:24.283 --> 11:27.184
that you will almost certainly
have a premature child.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.950
Now, with a premature baby,

11:30.122 --> 11:32.522
there are a whole new set
of complications.

11:32.692 --> 11:36.492
Often in cases where there's
an excess of amniotic fluid,

11:36.662 --> 11:39.631
we need to do additional
prenatal tests.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.369
Brandon, what are you doing here?

11:46.539 --> 11:49.599
Muntz told me where you were.
I thought I'd give you a hand.

11:49.775 --> 11:51.868
- Thanks.
- How you doing?

11:52.044 --> 11:54.035
I'll be all right. You?

11:54.213 --> 11:56.181
Don't get me started.

11:56.348 --> 11:58.748
So this is it for Laura here, huh?

11:58.918 --> 12:00.681
Yeah, I promised her parents

12:00.853 --> 12:04.050
I'd make sure everything
got shipped back to Fresno.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.153
What the hell.

12:06.325 --> 12:09.021
Well, you are a man, my friend.

12:09.862 --> 12:12.956
- How's she doing anyway?
- Well...

12:13.132 --> 12:14.565
Her parents say she'll be all right,

12:14.734 --> 12:16.668
but she'll be under someone's care
for a while.

12:16.836 --> 12:20.067
Apparently, it's not the first time
she tried to kill herself.

12:20.339 --> 12:22.739
Well, then, it's nothing you did.

12:23.809 --> 12:28.712
Hey, what about the play tonight?
I hope you changed your mind.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.949
I'd like to patch things up with Brenda,
but I can't go to this play.

12:33.119 --> 12:35.144
It's too bizarre.

12:35.321 --> 12:36.515
Yell at me if you have to but...

12:36.689 --> 12:38.987
Hey, this is between
you and Brenda.

12:39.158 --> 12:41.854
But the girl did take a lot of grief
for something she didn't do.

12:42.027 --> 12:46.259
I tried to apologize to Brenda,
but she told me to go take a flying leap.

12:47.266 --> 12:50.861
Maybe I can't go for Laura's sake.
This was so important to her, just...

12:51.036 --> 12:52.970
And to think I called you a man.

12:55.307 --> 12:58.003
Let's face it, Walsh, maybe we both
have weakness for women

12:58.177 --> 13:00.975
whose elevators
don't quite reach the penthouse.

13:01.147 --> 13:02.580
Or is Clare out of your system?

13:02.748 --> 13:06.741
Oh, Clare is gone,
but the curse of Clare remains.

13:06.919 --> 13:10.116
It looks like I may miss out on this trip
to Washington because of her.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.381
What's going on?

13:11.557 --> 13:13.752
I don't know. Something's going on.

13:13.926 --> 13:15.985
My name wasn't on the traveling list
in the handbook.

13:16.162 --> 13:17.186
It can't be a coincidence.

13:17.363 --> 13:20.230
Maybe it's just a mix-up. You should
talk to your buddy the chancellor.

13:20.399 --> 13:23.129
Believe me, I've tried, but ever since
he got back from Europe,

13:23.302 --> 13:25.497
he's been tied up.

13:25.871 --> 13:28.271
I don't know,
I'm sensing some strained vibes.

13:28.440 --> 13:32.308
And all I did was not lay a hand
on his wild-child daughter

13:32.478 --> 13:34.673
and tell him the truth about it.

13:35.514 --> 13:36.538
What's so funny?

13:36.715 --> 13:38.808
I'm just not used to
seeing you sweat, Walsh.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.316
Usually that's my department.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.224
OPENING TONIGHT
Cat on a Hot Tin Roof

13:47.393 --> 13:50.556
Tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips.
Tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips.

13:50.729 --> 13:52.788
Tip of the tongue...

13:55.167 --> 13:56.191
Break a Leg

13:56.368 --> 13:58.666
And I thought I was the only maniac

13:58.838 --> 14:01.705
who comes in two hours
before curtain up.

14:01.874 --> 14:03.239
How are you, darling?

14:03.409 --> 14:05.240
- I feel ready.
- Good.

14:05.411 --> 14:07.504
What's that?
Did you get an opening-night gift?

14:07.680 --> 14:08.908
I think so.

14:09.081 --> 14:10.480
Open it.

14:15.754 --> 14:18.154
Oh, my,
I haven't seen one of those in years.

14:18.324 --> 14:19.348
That is a treasure.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.089
What is it?

14:21.260 --> 14:25.492
It's an old tradition of the theater.
It's a St. Genesius medal.

14:25.664 --> 14:27.632
He's considered
the patron saint of actors.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.064
It protects the wearer
against a bad performance

14:30.236 --> 14:32.932
by inspiring the actor to greatness.

14:33.105 --> 14:36.506
- Or so the story goes.
- It's beautiful.

14:36.675 --> 14:40.008
I'd say it came
from someone quite special.

14:41.647 --> 14:42.671
Dylan

14:43.115 --> 14:44.776
I would say you were right.

14:54.059 --> 14:57.620
That's the end of that.
A lot of good taking my pills did.

14:57.796 --> 14:59.491
Come on, honey, don't get mad.

14:59.665 --> 15:02.930
Jesse, I'm not mad.
It just doesn't make sense to me.

15:03.102 --> 15:05.161
Dr. Haller said one thing,
Dr. Gordon another.

15:05.337 --> 15:07.532
I mean, don't you think
he could've been mistaken?

15:07.706 --> 15:10.732
Andrea, Dr. Gordon is
one of the best in L.A.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.606
You've been saying yourself all along
that something was wrong.

15:13.779 --> 15:15.076
What do I know?

15:15.247 --> 15:17.374
We're gonna get through this.

15:20.185 --> 15:23.154
I don't know, Jesse, maybe...
Maybe it's all my fault.

15:23.322 --> 15:26.587
I mean, maybe it's because
I worked around all those cats.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.920
And people say pregnant women
shouldn't be around them.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.221
Come on, Andrea,
that's nothing but an old wives' tale.

15:31.397 --> 15:33.729
Or maybe it was
because I kept getting out of bed

15:33.899 --> 15:35.924
when I shouldn't have, I...

15:36.268 --> 15:39.601
- I just know it's my fault.
- Hey, it is not your fault.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.332
Dr. Gordon said that sometimes
it's just bad luck.

15:42.508 --> 15:46.171
But when is the bad luck gonna end?
Are these nightmares coming true?

15:46.345 --> 15:47.835
Maybe we're gonna lose the baby.

15:48.013 --> 15:51.813
Hey, we are not
going to lose the baby.

15:52.651 --> 15:53.879
How do you know?

15:54.053 --> 15:57.352
How do I know? Come here.

16:01.460 --> 16:05.760
Oh, Jesse, when did you finish it?

16:06.065 --> 16:08.090
You know something, I don't know.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.258
I worked through the night,
the morning,

16:10.436 --> 16:13.098
and believe me, there's no way
I did all this work for nothing.

16:13.272 --> 16:15.331
Oh, it's perfect.

16:15.507 --> 16:17.873
We are coming back here
with our baby.

16:18.043 --> 16:19.977
Of course we are.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.212
Brenda was so awesome.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.786
I tell you, she was so good
in that big monologue at the end,

17:02.955 --> 17:04.752
I thought whole audience
stopped breathing.

17:04.923 --> 17:07.653
Yeah. She was really great,
wasn't she, Kelly?

17:07.826 --> 17:09.851
You know what, kid,
Kel tried out for the part,

17:10.029 --> 17:11.859
so she may have
a different interpretation.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.931
Actually,
I thought she was outstanding.

17:14.098 --> 17:15.259
Good, then it's unanimous.

17:15.434 --> 17:16.867
Guys, come on, let's go backstage.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.867
Yeah, let's go.

17:22.174 --> 17:24.108
Our little Brenda's
never gonna be the same again.

17:24.276 --> 17:26.540
What a job she did. I'm still shaking.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.738
Remind me to kick Steve's butt
for missing this one.

17:29.915 --> 17:33.407
Guys, I'll catch you at the party.
I just saw the chancellor, excuse me.

17:33.585 --> 17:35.951
Chancellor.
Chancellor Arnold, chancellor.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.645
Brandon,
your sister was magnificent.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.552
Thank you,
but listen, about the task force...

17:39.725 --> 17:41.659
Not now, Brandon,
we're late for our reservations.

17:41.827 --> 17:43.522
That's all right,
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

17:44.430 --> 17:49.094
Brandon, I'm just swamped tomorrow.
You know how it is.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.502
Bren, you were fabulous.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.010
- Absolutely.
- Thanks, guys.

18:02.181 --> 18:04.308
Yeah, it was so exciting to see
it all come together.

18:04.483 --> 18:06.075
I couldn't have done it
without your help.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.414
Really? And here was I
thinking I had a hand in it too.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.886
There's a fellow from Portland Rep
whose dying to meet you.

18:12.057 --> 18:14.548
- See you guys later.
- Yeah.

18:14.726 --> 18:17.058
Well, if she can't ignore us,
who can she ignore, right?

18:17.229 --> 18:19.220
- We better get out of here.
- Oh, I know.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.798
I have a meeting with Babyface's
management in the morning.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.798
- Will you tell Brenda?
- Absolutely.

18:23.969 --> 18:25.527
Okay, bye.

18:26.004 --> 18:28.996
After Randolph's warm welcome,
I think I'll be leaving too.

18:29.174 --> 18:30.971
If only I could find Dylan.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.134
So, what kind of investments
are you talking about?

18:33.312 --> 18:34.609
Well, it's a biochemical company.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.714
What they're doing
is cleaning up the environment.

18:36.882 --> 18:38.611
Our firm's done a lot of work
in that sector.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.445
- Well...
- Jim, come over.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.883
I want you to meet Eddie,
Roy Randolph's stage manager.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.114
- He's from New York.
- Our friends live in New York.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.224
- Oh, yeah, where?
- Buffalo.

18:47.659 --> 18:49.092
Uptown or downtown?

18:51.230 --> 18:52.891
Why don't you drop by the office
on Monday?

18:53.065 --> 18:54.430
I'll show you some of the research.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.398
I think Monday's gonna be a little
too late. How about tomorrow?

18:57.569 --> 18:59.594
- All right, what about the afternoon?
- Thank you.

18:59.771 --> 19:01.898
- All right, we'll see you then.
- All right.

19:03.275 --> 19:04.367
What was that all about?

19:04.543 --> 19:08.274
Oh, I'm thinking of making
an investment in Kevin's company.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.170
What, you don't approve?

19:10.349 --> 19:12.078
I have no say in what you do
with your money.

19:12.251 --> 19:14.719
That's why you have Jim.
So can we go now?

19:14.887 --> 19:18.550
Yeah. I've just gotta drag Erica
away from that party.

19:18.724 --> 19:23.161
Would you look at her?
She always wanted a big sister.

19:27.466 --> 19:28.956
Andrea,
you want me to call the gang?

19:29.134 --> 19:30.362
No, thanks.

19:30.536 --> 19:33.004
It's hard enough keeping
our parents away after we called them.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.265
I'd rather just...
I'd rather just settle in tonight.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.135
We can call everyone else
in the morning.

19:37.309 --> 19:38.401
All right.

19:38.577 --> 19:39.669
There we go.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.870
Now we can keep
track of you and the baby.

19:42.047 --> 19:44.072
Is that the fetal monitor?

19:44.249 --> 19:45.648
It monitors the baby's heart rate.

19:45.817 --> 19:49.344
- What's normal?
- Anywhere between 110 and 160.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.751
You can see,
your baby has a strong heart.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.551
It does, doesn't it?

19:53.725 --> 19:56.091
My name's Dottie and I'll be here
all night if you need me.

19:56.261 --> 19:57.853
And Dr. Gordon
will be by in the morning.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.224
- Thank you, Dottie.
- Okay.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.229
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:03.669 --> 20:06.137
Want me to run downstairs and
pick up a magazine or something?

20:06.305 --> 20:08.796
No, I'm exhausted.

20:08.974 --> 20:11.408
Hey, what time is your
Constitutional Law final tomorrow?

20:11.577 --> 20:13.568
It doesn't matter.
I'm not leaving you tonight.

20:13.745 --> 20:16.305
What are you gonna do, sit here
and watch the baby's heart rate?

20:16.481 --> 20:18.642
- Maybe.
- Crazy.

20:18.817 --> 20:21.081
It's amazing, huh?
He really does have a strong heart.

20:21.253 --> 20:24.620
She. Now go and ace that test.

20:24.790 --> 20:28.191
All right. But no bad dreams, okay?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.222
No bad dreams.

20:32.631 --> 20:35.156
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:46.545 --> 20:49.912
- Good morning, Miss Taylor.
- Good morning, Mr. Walsh.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.916
What are you doing here so early
on a Saturday?

20:54.386 --> 20:57.321
I'm not waiting for the library to open.
I'm on a stakeout.

20:57.489 --> 20:58.513
What?

20:58.690 --> 21:00.590
Trying to catch the chancellor
before he goes in.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.784
He's been kind of blowing me off
lately.

21:02.961 --> 21:05.259
Well, does this have anything to do
with Clare?

21:05.430 --> 21:07.022
<i>L' Affaire de Clare, what else?</i>

21:07.199 --> 21:09.224
Once again,
I play by the rules and I get burned.

21:09.401 --> 21:13.497
Look, my name is conspicuously
absent from the traveling roster.

21:13.672 --> 21:14.696
Not to mention the fact

21:14.873 --> 21:17.307
that everyone else
got their tickets yesterday except me.

21:17.476 --> 21:22.106
- This has gotta be a mistake.
- Nope, I'm afraid I have to face facts.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.681
I'm not going to Washington,
I'm not gonna meet the president,

21:24.850 --> 21:27.478
I'm not gonna pass Go and
collect $200, this is just the way it is.

21:27.653 --> 21:30.349
You know, you sound exactly
like the psych paper I'm writing.

21:30.522 --> 21:33.685
People, like, imagine the very worst
thing that could happen to them,

21:33.859 --> 21:38.387
and then it actually happens.
It's called self-fulfilling prophecy.

21:38.563 --> 21:41.031
Kel, don't analyze my torment.
Just comfort me.

21:41.199 --> 21:42.791
I know, I'm sorry.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.801
Everything's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be peachy-weachy.

21:45.971 --> 21:49.600
So raise that chin
and lose that dark cloud.

21:49.775 --> 21:51.265
"Peachy-weachy"?

21:51.443 --> 21:54.810
I'm sorry, it's the only thing
I could come up with this early.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.913
Oh, here he is.

21:57.082 --> 21:59.607
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

22:07.893 --> 22:09.656
Hi, Peggy,
I thought you were the chancellor.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.388
- Where is he?
- Already in the office returning calls.

22:12.564 --> 22:14.429
You think it'd be all right
if I saw him?

22:14.599 --> 22:17.898
I wouldn't.
It's not going to be a good day.

22:18.770 --> 22:20.294
Sorry.

22:30.916 --> 22:33.976
Sorry, it's taking a little longer
than I expected.

22:34.152 --> 22:35.619
Well, I don't have anywhere to be.

22:35.787 --> 22:37.186
Okay.

22:45.464 --> 22:48.524
- Sorry, go ahead.
- That's okay, I just work here.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.361
Welcome to hip-hop central.

22:51.269 --> 22:52.759
Thanks.

22:52.938 --> 22:54.462
So who are you waiting for?

22:54.639 --> 22:56.038
My girlfriend, actually.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.039
She's booking Babyface
for the C.U. Carnival.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.373
And to think I had you pegged
as a gangster-rap artist.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.673
No, my taste
is a little more old school.

23:03.849 --> 23:08.411
Oh, yeah, mine too.
O'Jays, George Clinton, Jackson Five?

23:08.587 --> 23:11.681
You're getting warmer,
but a little more jazz for me.

23:12.257 --> 23:14.316
So you like a little sax in your funk?

23:14.493 --> 23:17.394
Well, I like players
who can really play.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.462
You're a musician.

23:19.631 --> 23:21.622
Yeah, I'm a music major at C.U.

23:22.768 --> 23:27.034
I had a pretty kicking rap single last
year, but it didn't make much noise.

23:27.205 --> 23:29.196
You know,
I've been putting this band together.

23:29.374 --> 23:33.105
- A couple of college guys, studio rats.
- I'd love to hear them.

23:33.278 --> 23:35.337
Why don't you come
to a rehearsal and jam with them?

23:35.514 --> 23:37.243
- Really?
- Hey, I'm a junior rep here,

23:37.416 --> 23:40.214
which is one step above gofer.

23:40.385 --> 23:42.216
So unless
I wanna be making coffee forever,

23:42.387 --> 23:45.220
I better find the next big thing,
you know?

23:45.390 --> 23:46.857
Yeah.

23:48.727 --> 23:51.628
Why don't you call me?
I'm Ariel Hunter.

23:51.797 --> 23:53.560
- David Silver.
- Great.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.826
I'll be looking forward
to hearing from you.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.344
Wait a second. You mean,
the company that you wanna invest in

24:07.512 --> 24:10.003
is being started
by Suzanne's boyfriend?

24:10.182 --> 24:12.013
No, not just boyfriend, fiancé.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.043
And besides,
you spent the last half hour

24:14.219 --> 24:16.847
convincing me what a great sector
this is for the serious investor.

24:17.022 --> 24:19.786
Well, it is, but I'd like to know
a little bit more about Kevin.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.357
That's what I want too.

24:21.526 --> 24:24.086
Okay, why don't you bring him over
to the office on Monday, we...?

24:24.262 --> 24:26.662
Monday's no good,
he'll be in Arizona talking to investors.

24:26.832 --> 24:29.494
- I was thinking about tomorrow.
- Tomorrow's Sunday.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.768
All right. What are you and Kevin
doing for brunch tomorrow?

24:34.940 --> 24:37.204
- That's better.
- Great.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.935
But first, I gotta go upstairs
and clear it with the boss.

24:48.019 --> 24:51.682
Miss Maggie, I figured
you'd be on cloud nine about now.

24:51.857 --> 24:54.690
<i>Jim told me
about the review in The Condor.</i>

24:55.093 --> 24:57.118
Yes, it was very generous.

24:57.295 --> 25:00.389
It described how I lit up the stage
with desperation and passion,

25:00.565 --> 25:02.897
possessing a maturity
beyond my years.

25:03.068 --> 25:04.797
Could this possibly be the same girl

25:04.970 --> 25:07.905
that I took fishing the day after
she dropped out of Minnesota?

25:08.073 --> 25:09.665
Well, there is a vague resemblance.

25:12.010 --> 25:16.538
Although, going fishing with you was
one of the best times I had all year.

25:16.715 --> 25:18.307
Better than starring in the play?

25:19.284 --> 25:20.546
Close.

25:22.787 --> 25:26.018
You know, I never got to properly
thank you for my present.

25:29.294 --> 25:31.819
- I think it worked.
- Well, I'm glad.

25:31.997 --> 25:35.626
And through all
the audition craziness,

25:36.334 --> 25:38.302
you were really the only one
who stood by me.

25:41.273 --> 25:42.900
Thank you.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.312
- Brenda...
- Dylan...

25:53.084 --> 25:54.415
You go first.

25:56.187 --> 25:58.121
I was just gonna excuse myself.

26:00.292 --> 26:04.126
I have to get to the theater.
What were you gonna say?

26:05.096 --> 26:06.586
Have a good show.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.109
Donna, you shouldn't have.

26:24.282 --> 26:26.011
I already got so much stuff
from my parents,

26:26.184 --> 26:28.846
Jesse's parents, Grandma Rose.

26:29.721 --> 26:32.121
An Etch A Sketch? How great.

26:32.290 --> 26:33.814
Well, when I was
having my tonsils out,

26:33.992 --> 26:35.687
it helped me through
a long hospital stay.

26:35.860 --> 26:37.122
Thank you.

26:37.295 --> 26:40.196
- Here, check out the book.
- There's a book?

26:43.702 --> 26:45.226
<i>- "Color Therapy and Pregnancy"?
- Yeah.</i>

26:45.403 --> 26:47.894
I got it at this woman's bookstore.
It is so neat.

26:48.073 --> 26:50.303
It explains if you're having trouble
with your pregnancy,

26:50.475 --> 26:52.067
you need to white light the negativity.

26:52.243 --> 26:55.212
And then you imagine pink all around
your heart because that's love.

26:55.380 --> 26:57.211
And then your baby
will know that it's wanted.

26:57.382 --> 27:00.215
Thank you. I love it.

27:01.419 --> 27:03.182
- So how you doing?
- Good.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.983
I just lined up this terrific headline act
for the Mardi Gras.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.325
And David just got invited to sit in
with this new band at a jam session.

27:09.494 --> 27:12.054
I'm gonna go over and meet him
at this Hollywood recording studio.

27:12.230 --> 27:15.290
Wow, that's so exciting.
You have to tell Jesse.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.128
When he heard David play
at your apartment,

27:17.302 --> 27:18.633
he thought David was so talented.

27:19.304 --> 27:22.637
Well, David is talented.
And Jesse's no slouch either.

27:22.807 --> 27:25.105
He's been such a rock.

27:26.044 --> 27:27.875
Jesse, hey,
I got your message, man.

27:28.046 --> 27:30.844
I'm glad you're here.
Donna's in with her right now.

27:31.016 --> 27:32.381
How you doing?

27:32.550 --> 27:34.745
I feel like I'm upside down.

27:34.919 --> 27:37.581
I still have to call
all of Andrea's professors.

27:37.756 --> 27:39.587
She's not gonna be able
to finish the semester.

27:39.758 --> 27:41.885
That's all right.
She can make it up next semester.

27:42.060 --> 27:46.622
Yeah, it's just been hard.
Everything's changed so fast.

27:47.432 --> 27:49.059
You know, Brandon,

27:49.234 --> 27:53.068
I could never tell Andrea this
but, man, I am scared to death.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.636
The best we're gonna have
is a premature child.

27:55.807 --> 27:57.798
What kind of chance
will the kid have to be normal?

27:57.976 --> 27:59.876
Oh, come on,
lots of kids are born early.

28:00.045 --> 28:02.843
Yeah, but if it's a boy and he's small,
he'll get picked on.

28:03.014 --> 28:06.074
That's not necessarily true.
And besides, you might have a girl.

28:06.251 --> 28:08.242
That's what we're hoping for.

28:08.420 --> 28:11.548
We found out girl preemies
have a much better survival rate.

28:12.624 --> 28:14.353
Oh, Dr. Gordon's here. Come on.

28:18.063 --> 28:20.759
Everything's stable,
but I'd like to do an amnio.

28:20.932 --> 28:24.368
Amniocentesis, why?
To determine the baby's sex?

28:24.536 --> 28:27.630
Maybe you'd be more comfortable
if we didn't discuss this with friends.

28:27.806 --> 28:30.900
No, that's okay, they're like family.
Why do I need an amnio?

28:31.076 --> 28:35.206
Well, in cases of excessive fluid
like yours, there's a 3 percent chance

28:35.380 --> 28:36.972
of the baby being born
with birth defects.

28:37.148 --> 28:40.413
It's a high enough number
that we should check.

28:40.585 --> 28:42.348
Don't even think about it.

28:42.520 --> 28:43.544
I won't.

28:44.989 --> 28:47.287
We're gonna white light
all negativity, right?

28:47.759 --> 28:50.421
- Think pink.
- Pink.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.545
- Hey, P.K.
- Yeah?

29:11.916 --> 29:15.044
There's an alien at your stack.

29:15.987 --> 29:18.251
All right, knock it off, you guys.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.051
This is the keyboardist
I was telling you kooks about.

29:21.226 --> 29:24.024
David Silver, I'd like you to meet
Carlos, Lenny and P.K.

29:24.195 --> 29:25.287
- How's it going?
- What up?

29:25.463 --> 29:28.364
Dude, you look familiar.
You with that sorry group, Slinger?

29:30.268 --> 29:31.735
No. I go to C.U.

29:31.903 --> 29:35.498
Oh, yeah? I went there a semester.
Damn, I know we've met.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.403
Yeah, look,
I'm sorry, the technician let me in.

29:39.577 --> 29:40.737
I guess I'm a little early.

29:40.912 --> 29:42.777
No, I think we were a little bit late.

29:42.947 --> 29:45.848
But why don't you stick with that riff
you were playing? That was great.

29:46.017 --> 29:47.507
And you guys just warm into it, okay?

29:47.685 --> 29:50.711
Come on, come on.
Get up to your drums, Carlos.

29:50.889 --> 29:52.516
Whenever you're ready, David.

30:10.608 --> 30:12.235
B, your old man was unbelievable.

30:12.410 --> 30:15.140
I thought he was gonna put me
and Kevin on the back burner.

30:15.313 --> 30:16.974
He said if he likes what he hears
tomorrow,

30:17.148 --> 30:19.548
the firm will probably get behind it,
they'll do it up right.

30:19.717 --> 30:21.912
- Sounds like Jim smells money.
- That's my dad.

30:22.587 --> 30:24.214
Well, good luck with it.

30:24.389 --> 30:25.981
What?
You're coming to the brunch, right?

30:26.157 --> 30:29.615
- I wasn't invited.
- Kel, of course you're invited.

30:29.794 --> 30:31.591
Then I'd love to come
if you want me there.

30:31.763 --> 30:33.390
Kel, I think that's what he just said.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.426
Look, if she can't make it, I can.
What's the grub?

30:36.601 --> 30:37.727
Stop it. I'll go.

30:37.902 --> 30:39.802
I can now die a happy man.

30:39.971 --> 30:43.372
<i>I have seen the definitive performance
of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,</i>

30:43.541 --> 30:46.135
by our own, incomparable,
Brenda Walsh.

30:46.311 --> 30:48.074
Thank you, thank you.

30:48.246 --> 30:50.612
- Good show tonight, sis?
- Even better than opening night.

30:50.782 --> 30:53.410
Your sister has the makings
of a fine actress,

30:53.585 --> 30:56.145
assuming she gets herself
some classical training.

30:56.321 --> 30:58.585
You know, actually,
she does have some classical training.

30:58.756 --> 31:00.223
What was the name of that play
you did

31:00.391 --> 31:01.983
where you almost
took your clothes off?

31:02.160 --> 31:04.856
Yeah, that's right.
Steve actually came to that play.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.661
Brenda,
I said I was sorry for everything.

31:08.433 --> 31:09.695
Talk is cheap, Steve.

31:10.602 --> 31:13.036
Look, tomorrow's the last performance.
It's a matinee.

31:15.340 --> 31:19.299
Well, I guess there's not really
much point in asking them to join us.

31:19.844 --> 31:22.142
I said I was sorry.
The girl's never gonna forgive me.

31:22.747 --> 31:25.147
- See the play.
- See the play, Steve.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.517
Hi.

32:34.686 --> 32:35.914
You were dreaming, weren't you?

32:36.487 --> 32:37.749
Yeah, how did you know?

32:37.922 --> 32:41.187
Pregnant women dream a lot.
Some of them are quite telling.

32:41.359 --> 32:42.986
Oh, I hope so.

32:43.161 --> 32:46.460
I've been having
the same horrible nightmare for days.

32:46.631 --> 32:48.997
But this one, it was different.

32:49.167 --> 32:54.867
I finally found my baby.
It was tiny, but, oh, it was perfect.

32:55.039 --> 32:56.870
Sounds like your nightmare's over.

33:16.828 --> 33:20.161
All right. He's great.

33:35.279 --> 33:39.113
All right, all right, man, way to go,
my boy D is in the house.

33:39.283 --> 33:42.150
- Full props, man.
- Thanks, man, I was jumping.

33:42.320 --> 33:45.312
Yeah, dude, you can play
with this band any day.

33:45.490 --> 33:46.855
- Great chops.
- Thanks, man.

33:47.025 --> 33:50.256
You know, after I got out of the whole
DJ thing, I kind of got my act together.

33:50.428 --> 33:51.952
Hold on.
Now I know where I've seen you.

33:52.130 --> 33:54.792
You're the radio guy that used
to hang out at Mr. Andy's room.

33:55.566 --> 33:58.330
Yeah, yeah, that's me.
It was a while ago.

33:58.503 --> 34:01.063
Wait, hold on, one second,
if you do that whole radio thing,

34:01.239 --> 34:02.604
you must know my man Howard,
right?

34:02.774 --> 34:04.298
Yeah. Yeah, I know Howard.

34:04.475 --> 34:07.137
Well, you're gonna feel right at home,
because Lenny just happens

34:07.311 --> 34:11.042
to have a gram of orange juice
right in his bag.

34:14.152 --> 34:18.020
David, you make me look like a genius.
You can really play.

34:18.188 --> 34:20.089
Hey, thanks. It was a blast.

34:20.257 --> 34:21.850
David, that was terrific.

34:22.025 --> 34:24.585
So when Ariel asked,
I had to say yes.

34:24.762 --> 34:26.753
- I hope you don't mind.
- Asked what?

34:27.632 --> 34:30.931
If Donna could book you guys
as the opening act for Babyface.

34:31.101 --> 34:33.627
- All right.
- Hey, that's our first gig.

34:33.804 --> 34:36.239
- But we don't have any songs.
- Well, there's plenty of time.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.204
I brought you some tunes
from my office.

34:38.376 --> 34:40.435
Why don't you go through
and pick out a few you like?

34:40.610 --> 34:42.545
I trust your taste.

34:44.748 --> 34:47.149
David, you're gonna fit right in
with this band.

34:59.063 --> 35:01.224
Hi, Brandon, what are you doing
here on a Sunday?

35:01.399 --> 35:03.060
Well, I was over
at the chancellor's place

35:03.234 --> 35:05.361
and his housekeeper told me
he was in his office.

35:05.536 --> 35:07.265
Yes, he is.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.804
There's been so much to catch up on
since he's been gone.

35:09.974 --> 35:11.305
I'm sure, but I'm going in anyway.

35:11.476 --> 35:13.273
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

35:13.444 --> 35:14.468
No, you're not.

35:14.645 --> 35:17.512
Chancellor Arnold, I'm sorry.
I did try to stop him.

35:17.682 --> 35:19.616
Yes, she did.
You got a great employee here, sir.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.911
Just great. Excuse us, please.

35:22.520 --> 35:25.956
- Just what do you think you're doing?
- I'm looking for a reprieve, sir.

35:26.124 --> 35:29.025
Okay, I admit
I was attracted to your daughter.

35:29.193 --> 35:31.718
- Brandon...
- Okay, I was very attracted to her.

35:31.896 --> 35:33.830
But I never laid a hand on her, sir.
Never.

35:33.998 --> 35:36.023
- Brandon...
- No "Brandons", please, just listen.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.359
I worked my guts out
for this task force

35:38.536 --> 35:41.027
and just because you can't handle
the truth about your daughter,

35:41.205 --> 35:43.469
doesn't mean I should lose my chance
to go to Washington.

35:43.641 --> 35:46.508
- What? You're going to Washington.
- Right, right.

35:46.677 --> 35:48.508
Then where are my airline tickets?

35:49.113 --> 35:52.640
And how come my name was
purposely left out of the handbook?

35:53.684 --> 35:56.778
There was a printer error
on the master list, I imagine.

35:56.954 --> 35:59.787
Which is probably
why you didn't get your tickets either.

35:59.957 --> 36:01.857
Why would you think otherwise?

36:02.026 --> 36:05.689
You're my point man for the whole
California contingent, for God's sake.

36:06.330 --> 36:09.163
- So I'm really going?
- Absolutely.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.633
And I admire
the way you handled my daughter.

36:12.803 --> 36:14.634
Someone had to put her in her place.

36:18.209 --> 36:21.610
Well, I was just double-checking.

36:24.081 --> 36:25.981
No big deal.

36:31.923 --> 36:33.891
Hey, Jim,
it's okay to use your fingers.

36:34.058 --> 36:35.150
Thank you, Dylan.

36:35.326 --> 36:38.227
So Suzanne was saying you were
in the Army Corps of Engineers?

36:38.396 --> 36:40.762
Yeah, I signed up
right after I graduated from Cal Poly.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.263
Oh, that's a wonderful school.

36:42.433 --> 36:43.457
Well, it was for me.

36:43.634 --> 36:47.035
It's the first time that I started
playing around with microorganisms

36:47.205 --> 36:48.729
to help clean up the environment.

36:48.906 --> 36:50.897
Yeah, where'd you ever get that idea,
anyway?

36:51.075 --> 36:54.374
I was trying to develop
a self-cleaning fish tank.

36:54.545 --> 36:57.309
- So you've always been an inventor.
- I'd say more of a dabbler.

36:57.481 --> 36:58.505
Oh, not true.

36:58.683 --> 37:01.481
If I could harness half of your
creative energies, I'd be a rich woman.

37:01.652 --> 37:03.882
Not if you had my timing.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.853
Well, sometimes it takes a little time
to get all the elements in place.

37:07.024 --> 37:09.322
Yeah, well, in my case, Jim,
it's taken 20 years.

37:09.493 --> 37:12.155
And I can just kick myself
for not doing it sooner.

37:12.330 --> 37:13.354
Why is that?

37:13.531 --> 37:16.432
Because in that 20 years, we've done
an awful lot of damage to the bay.

37:16.601 --> 37:18.262
Really, the oceans
are getting so polluted,

37:18.436 --> 37:20.404
it's a wonder
we'll ever make it to next century.

37:20.571 --> 37:23.199
Well, that's why
this can be such a profitable venture.

37:23.374 --> 37:25.808
If the profit is there,
the investors will be lining up.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.740
Just make sure
they're lining up behind me.

37:28.212 --> 37:30.043
Since when did you become
such a capitalist?

37:30.214 --> 37:31.408
Since I met Kevin.

37:39.023 --> 37:41.389
Andrea's on another floor
having some test.

37:41.559 --> 37:42.719
I wanna wait.

37:42.893 --> 37:44.383
Okay.

37:44.895 --> 37:48.126
You haven't said a word about
the tapes you listened to this morning.

37:48.299 --> 37:50.028
Any good material?

37:50.201 --> 37:52.692
Yeah, yeah, it was excellent.

37:53.404 --> 37:56.464
Gosh, talk about the right place
at the right time.

37:56.641 --> 37:59.371
If you hadn't come with me,
this never would have happened.

37:59.543 --> 38:02.569
Look, Donna, if you wanna book
Ariel's band, you can.

38:02.747 --> 38:04.715
But I've made up my mind.
I'm moving on.

38:05.750 --> 38:06.842
Wait a second.

38:07.018 --> 38:10.852
You're just as good a player
as all the others, maybe better.

38:11.455 --> 38:14.083
Thanks. But I can't
go down that road again.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.785
Donna, those guys
are all drug hounds.

38:19.463 --> 38:21.260
Why didn't you tell me?

38:21.432 --> 38:24.367
Because I've been trying to rationalize
how it can work.

38:24.535 --> 38:26.366
But I know as soon as I get in
with those guys,

38:26.537 --> 38:28.903
I'll be right back in the speed zone.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.638
Look, I'm not booking them.
I'll make up some excuse.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.402
And I'm canceling Babyface too.

38:34.578 --> 38:36.910
No, no, no,
that's not Babyface's scene.

38:37.081 --> 38:39.811
He's got a reputation
as being a class act in the business.

38:42.520 --> 38:45.011
So much for my Mardi Gras, huh?

38:46.557 --> 38:49.355
Well, you can still give me a hand
with Babyface.

38:49.527 --> 38:53.156
You know, help out
with the stage crew or the lights, or...

38:54.498 --> 38:56.329
I'm sorry.

38:56.801 --> 38:59.167
I guess that's kind of a comedown
from performing, huh?

39:05.743 --> 39:08.075
- Tell Andrea I'll be by tonight.
- Sure.

39:08.245 --> 39:10.338
Am I gonna see you tonight?

39:10.514 --> 39:12.277
I'll call you.

39:14.151 --> 39:15.345
Dylan, what's going on with us?

39:15.519 --> 39:21.219
I mean, take away the sex
and we have no relationship.

39:21.392 --> 39:23.292
I don't know.

39:23.461 --> 39:26.862
Some kind of
communication breakdown?

39:27.998 --> 39:30.057
The question is, is it fixable?

39:30.668 --> 39:34.069
Are you willing to forget everything
that happened in the last few weeks?

39:35.706 --> 39:37.503
I could do that.

39:46.884 --> 39:48.613
Consider it fixed.

39:50.755 --> 39:52.655
I'll see you later.

39:54.592 --> 39:57.152
- Kel, thanks for coming to the brunch.
- You're welcome.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.493
I think that Jim was really
impressed by Kevin.

40:00.664 --> 40:02.154
Well, what's not to be
impressed about?

40:02.333 --> 40:04.631
Pretty soon he's gonna be
a regular moneymaking machine.

40:06.637 --> 40:07.934
What, did I say something?

40:09.407 --> 40:10.431
- No.
- You sure?

40:10.608 --> 40:12.576
Because you're biting your lip.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.474
Listen to yourself,
you're already spending your profits.

40:15.646 --> 40:17.546
So, what's wrong with me
wanting to make a buck?

40:17.715 --> 40:20.343
The fact is that ever since
Suzanne moved here, you've changed.

40:20.518 --> 40:21.712
- Okay.
- Why don't you just...?

40:21.886 --> 40:23.478
Why don't you just
keep grinding that ax?

40:23.654 --> 40:26.452
Because that's what this is about.
You resent Suzanne, you resent Erica,

40:26.624 --> 40:29.286
anything that takes my attention
away from you for a little while.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.291
I see.

40:31.929 --> 40:34.762
You know, I think we were both wrong.
I don't think this is fixable.

40:34.932 --> 40:37.059
You know what,
maybe you were right.

40:37.234 --> 40:39.361
I think we need to start
seeing other people.

40:39.537 --> 40:41.471
Yeah, I know how that song goes.

40:41.639 --> 40:43.937
You should.
You taught it to me, remember?

40:46.343 --> 40:47.776
So this is it?

40:48.979 --> 40:50.276
That's what it looks like.

41:20.611 --> 41:22.545
Brenda, it was a real pleasure
working with you.

41:22.713 --> 41:24.112
I hope we can do it again.

41:24.281 --> 41:25.578
Thanks, Tom.

41:25.749 --> 41:30.516
Brenda, I just wanna tell you,
you weren't half bad.

41:30.688 --> 41:32.087
Thanks.

41:32.256 --> 41:35.521
From Eddie, that's the highest
compliment you can get.

41:35.693 --> 41:37.354
As for me,
I didn't expect to come here

41:37.528 --> 41:39.587
and actually find an actress.

41:39.763 --> 41:41.731
If only she had the proper training.

41:41.899 --> 41:46.461
Training you can get.
Talent is innate.

41:46.637 --> 41:48.332
Thanks, Roy.

41:54.545 --> 41:56.172
Steve.

41:57.147 --> 41:59.638
If I'd known you were in the audience,
I would've worked harder.

41:59.817 --> 42:02.684
Brenda, you were great.
I'm glad I came.

42:03.687 --> 42:05.052
I'm glad you came too.

42:05.222 --> 42:06.348
Enough to forgive me?

42:07.892 --> 42:09.883
Yeah, enough.

42:13.898 --> 42:16.162
My makeup, I'm so sorry.

42:16.700 --> 42:17.997
New jacket?

42:22.306 --> 42:25.275
- Hey, you just missed everybody.
- That's all right.

42:25.442 --> 42:28.275
I didn't come here to see anyone else.
I just came here to see you.

42:28.846 --> 42:30.177
Why are you so happy?

42:30.347 --> 42:32.042
Well, I leave
for Washington later today.

42:32.216 --> 42:33.240
What could be the matter?

42:33.417 --> 42:35.214
- Brandon, that's great.
- I guess it is.

42:35.386 --> 42:37.320
And how are you doing?
Any change since yesterday?

42:37.488 --> 42:39.513
No, which is good news.

42:39.690 --> 42:41.681
I just have to hang in there
for the long haul.

42:41.859 --> 42:43.520
I'm still hoping to take this baby
to term.

42:43.694 --> 42:45.025
Yeah.

42:45.195 --> 42:48.164
Sorry, Brandon, you have to step out.
Dr. Gordon's on his way to examine.

42:48.332 --> 42:50.459
No, problem. I slip in, I slip out.

42:50.634 --> 42:52.727
I'm getting to know
my way around this hospital.

42:52.903 --> 42:55.428
- Just don't practice any surgery.
- I know.

42:55.606 --> 42:57.631
Tell Brenda thanks for the flowers.
Steve too.

42:57.808 --> 42:59.537
You got it.

43:00.778 --> 43:02.245
Honey, you need anything? Do...?

43:02.413 --> 43:07.407
Jesse, you gotta call Dr. Gordon.
I think my water just broke.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.246
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

43:09.820 --> 43:12.448
Hey, Andrea, take it easy.

43:12.623 --> 43:14.648
Brandon, this can't be happening.
It just can't be.

43:14.825 --> 43:15.849
Just relax, okay?

43:16.026 --> 43:18.153
Everything's gonna be fine.
Just take it easy.

43:18.329 --> 43:19.956
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be fine.

43:20.130 --> 43:21.825
Dr. Gordon, I was just laughing.

43:23.734 --> 43:25.224
Yes, we have a rupture.

43:25.402 --> 43:27.597
We better get her up to
Labor and Delivery right away.

43:27.771 --> 43:30.467
She could have this baby
at any moment. I'm sorry, Andrea.

43:30.641 --> 43:33.701
- No, it's too soon. It's just too soon.
- We'll do everything we can.

43:33.877 --> 43:35.936
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- No, it's not.

43:36.113 --> 43:38.775
Just listen to the doctor.
I'm not going until the baby's delivered.

43:38.949 --> 43:41.247
- Andrea, everything's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not.

43:41.418 --> 43:42.817
This is all wrong.
