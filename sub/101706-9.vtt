WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:04.787
<i>Previously on</i> SWA... I've been looking around
for a new place.

00:04.830 --> 00:05.962
Might be able to lock down
something swanky with a roommate

00:06.006 --> 00:07.311
-to share costs.
-Are you kidding?

00:07.355 --> 00:10.010
-Hell yeah!
-All right!

00:10.053 --> 00:11.359
So,
housewarming.

00:11.402 --> 00:12.403
I'll handle the
margaritas,

00:12.447 --> 00:14.101
you handle themusic. Sure.

00:14.144 --> 00:16.190
Hey, Hondo, you got
someone to cover for me
tomorrow?

00:16.233 --> 00:18.801
Erika could cover for you.
Rocker's team has tomorrow
off.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.237
-<i>She'd be down for it.
You think
this is the</i>

00:20.281 --> 00:21.282
<i>white supremacist
group the Imperial
Dukes?</i>

00:21.325 --> 00:22.935
<i>That's
my worry.</i>

00:22.979 --> 00:24.198
<i>These aren't just
smash-and-grabs.</i>

00:24.241 --> 00:25.503
<i>They're coordinated hate
crimes.</i>

00:25.547 --> 00:27.201
<i>The guy I arrested
yesterday was wearing</i>

00:27.244 --> 00:28.898
-<i>the same kind of bandana.
Abel
McConnell</i>

00:28.941 --> 00:30.421
<i>was spotted entering the
compound about 40 minutes
ago.</i>

00:30.465 --> 00:31.466
Give me
two!

00:31.509 --> 00:32.510
Shots
fired!

00:32.554 --> 00:33.685
Coming from the
attic.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.258
Guten Tag, Chris. What's
up?

00:41.302 --> 00:43.695
Hey. Areyou okay?

00:43.739 --> 00:46.089
She'sdead.
Whoa,

00:46.133 --> 00:47.786
what are you talking
about? Who's dead?

00:47.830 --> 00:48.874
Erika.

00:48.918 --> 00:51.964
Erika Rogers? What
happened, Chris?

00:53.575 --> 00:55.925
It all went down so
fast. During the raid...

00:57.796 --> 00:58.884
...a bullet winged
Tan.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.712
I'm hit!

01:00.756 --> 01:02.584
I'll cover you. Go,
go!

01:04.542 --> 01:05.891
Erika and I brought
him out safe.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.284
<i>He's
okay.</i>

01:07.328 --> 01:10.374
<i>Suspect down. Clear
for entry.</i>

01:11.462 --> 01:13.812
Youokay? Hey.

01:13.856 --> 01:16.424
I think I was hit,
too.

01:18.295 --> 01:20.254
We didn't know Erika got
hit until just after.

01:21.864 --> 01:25.476
It was an armor-piercing
round from the shooter.

01:25.520 --> 01:28.392
All
units...

01:28.436 --> 01:30.525
58-David is
down.

01:31.961 --> 01:35.791
I repeat,
58-David is
down.

01:35.834 --> 01:39.490
We've lost Erika
Rogers.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.756
Over.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.672
Dear God.
Hondo,

01:47.716 --> 01:49.761
call FID, tell 'em
we have an officer
down.

01:49.805 --> 01:51.023
I'll call Chief
Rivera.

01:53.504 --> 01:56.420
I have to notify Officer
Rogers's next of kin

01:56.464 --> 01:57.943
before the press leaks
it.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.771
Roger that,

02:05.473 --> 02:06.517
Commander.

02:06.561 --> 02:08.215
Alonso, what are you
doing?

02:08.258 --> 02:10.260
You're gonna
tell Erika's
sister.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.914
I want to come with
you.

02:11.957 --> 02:14.134
You need to go
back to the scene.

02:14.177 --> 02:16.048
This is an
officer-involved shooting.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.834
You and the team have to
talk to FID before anyone
else.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.143
Please,
Commander.

02:24.187 --> 02:27.059
I'm sorry. Go
back.

02:30.889 --> 02:31.934
That's an
order.

02:38.897 --> 02:42.118
I'm sorry to lay this on
you, but they got us
separated.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.208
There's no one here for
me to talk to.

02:45.252 --> 02:46.992
I think I'm freaking
out.

02:47.036 --> 02:48.255
No, I'm glad you called
me.

02:48.298 --> 02:49.821
Did you tell Deac
yet?

02:49.865 --> 02:52.824
Hondo called him right
after we finished with FID.

02:52.868 --> 02:54.957
I don't know
what to do.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.439
We've never lost
a teammate
before.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.789
SWAT doesn't lose
officers.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.834
Man, I wish I could be
there for you right now.

03:02.878 --> 03:05.489
Please stay on the
phone with me.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.187
I'm here as long as you need
me.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.232
I'm not going
anywhere.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.062
The chief and I
extend our deepest
sympathies

03:13.105 --> 03:14.846
to you and your
family.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.197
An assistance
officer will be here
shortly

03:17.240 --> 03:19.068
to help you make
arrangements.

03:23.768 --> 03:24.856
What's her sister's
name?

03:24.900 --> 03:27.163
Latasha. She's
Officer Rogers's

03:27.207 --> 03:28.860
only next of kin in the
city.

03:28.904 --> 03:33.169
Chief Rivera, it should be
me. I should tell her.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.866
Are you sure,
Commander?

03:34.910 --> 03:36.520
Yes,
sir.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.914
Okay. I'll follow your
lead.

03:38.957 --> 03:40.655
All
right.

03:45.921 --> 03:46.965
Ms.
Rogers...

03:53.058 --> 03:55.974
Oh, my God.
No.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.933
Ma'am...
No.

03:57.976 --> 04:00.936
I regret to inform
you that your sister
died

04:00.979 --> 04:05.593
in the line of
duty earliertoday. No, please.

04:05.636 --> 04:07.334
No!

04:07.377 --> 04:10.119
I'm so sorry,
Latasha.

04:10.162 --> 04:12.600
Please... The chiefand I extend our
deepest sympathies

04:12.643 --> 04:14.210
to you and your
family.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.866
No...

04:56.383 --> 04:59.342
I've gone on record
before saying that
money's going

04:59.386 --> 05:00.648
to all the wrong
places in this city.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.650
In all herinfinite wisdom...

05:02.693 --> 05:05.609
That was quite a
service this morning,
Commander.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.437
Glad to see Officer
Rogers's extended family

05:07.481 --> 05:08.830
came in from
Houston.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.135
They could
see cops
from

05:10.179 --> 05:12.312
as far as New York
to Maryland
attended.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.922
We're gonna have a
plaque in honor of her
memory

05:13.965 --> 05:16.403
and service here atHQ. That's a great
gesture.

05:16.446 --> 05:19.493
I came to tell you that
FID's finished its
investigation

05:19.536 --> 05:21.059
of 20-Squad's
raid.

05:21.103 --> 05:23.540
Our union rep's delivering
their report by the end of
today.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.368
Any sense how
it's looking for
us?

05:25.412 --> 05:26.369
I haven't heard either
way.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.805
City Councilman
Dudley's

05:27.849 --> 05:29.067
been criticizing
SWAT pretty hard

05:29.111 --> 05:30.460
the past few
days.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.636
A civilian and a
Black female officer
killed.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.030
It's horribleoptics. I get that.

05:35.073 --> 05:37.380
And we're examining
everything on our end.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.861
It's a tragedy we all
feel personally.

05:39.904 --> 05:42.167
In politics,
tragedies provide
opportunity.

05:42.211 --> 05:44.431
Dudley's running for
mayor.

05:44.474 --> 05:45.736
And after the
past summer's
unrest,

05:45.780 --> 05:47.390
the mayor is in the hot
seat.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.436
People want
reform. That
includes LAPD

05:49.479 --> 05:51.786
-and city hall.
-Some people
want sincere
reform,

05:51.829 --> 05:54.223
others just
want a powergrab. Either
way,

05:54.266 --> 05:56.617
the public may
demand a pound of
flesh.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.096
We train the right
way.

05:58.140 --> 06:00.011
We do things the right
way.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.970
Let's hope the FID
report clears your
officers.

06:15.853 --> 06:18.029
Nichelle,
hey.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.249
Hey. You working
today?

06:20.292 --> 06:22.860
They got us on desk duty
until the FID report comes
back.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.296
Well, I won't keep
you.

06:24.340 --> 06:27.299
We really don't get
to speak much these
days.

06:27.343 --> 06:29.954
I haven't seen you stop by
the community center
lately.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.043
Just wanted to check
in,

06:32.087 --> 06:33.131
see how the funeral
went.

06:33.175 --> 06:35.177
The team's taking
it pretty hard,

06:35.220 --> 06:37.309
but we're all showing
up.

06:37.353 --> 06:39.399
And how about
you?

06:39.442 --> 06:42.097
I don't know, I'm,
uh...

06:42.140 --> 06:44.099
still
processing.

06:44.142 --> 06:46.580
Well, I know you're trying
to get better at opening
up.

06:46.623 --> 06:49.931
If you want to talk, you
know where to find me.

06:49.974 --> 06:52.673
I do. Thank you,
Nichelle.

06:52.716 --> 06:55.937
Heard the FID
report's coming out
today.

06:55.980 --> 06:56.981
Keep your head
up.

06:57.025 --> 07:00.028
Thanks,
man.

07:00.071 --> 07:03.858
Rocker... I am so
sorry about Erika.

07:05.860 --> 07:08.950
She was a great team
member.

07:08.993 --> 07:11.474
You know,
curious, great
spirit.

07:11.518 --> 07:14.477
Constantly
asking
questions.

07:14.521 --> 07:17.219
She admired you,
Hondo.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.703
Looks like you're
retracing your steps fromthe raid? I'm doing what I
can.

07:22.746 --> 07:24.966
I have no idea what that
report's gonna say, so...

07:25.009 --> 07:26.576
I just want to make
sure that I remember

07:26.620 --> 07:29.449
how everything went
down...

07:29.492 --> 07:32.103
in case I got to
defend my
decisions.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.681
Here.

07:44.725 --> 07:48.511
David, I know it's not
the best time to ask,
but...

07:48.555 --> 07:50.426
do you need to goback? Yeah.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.646
I'm the only member of the
squad that's cleared for field
duty,

07:52.689 --> 07:54.691
so I have to go
back if we get a
call.

07:54.735 --> 07:57.041
I mean, to SWAT.
Period.

07:58.173 --> 08:00.654
Are you open to
leaving?

08:00.697 --> 08:02.656
You mean
retiring?

08:04.179 --> 08:06.877
Annie, I'm a year away
from collecting my
pension.

08:06.921 --> 08:08.749
Yeah, but private
security's going so well.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.838
You've got great
benefits.

08:10.881 --> 08:13.014
And if you did that
full-time, you'd still have a
great job

08:13.057 --> 08:14.406
that you love, and
you wouldn't be

08:14.450 --> 08:16.321
in this kind of
danger all the time.

08:16.365 --> 08:17.584
Can we talk about this
later?

08:17.627 --> 08:20.238
What if later is too
late?

08:20.282 --> 08:21.631
If you were
there three days
ago,

08:21.675 --> 08:24.155
that might have been your
funeral instead of Erika's.

08:24.199 --> 08:26.549
You don't know
that.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.986
Where does that put
me and the kids?

08:29.030 --> 08:30.988
I can't do all
this without you.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.860
I don't ever want
to.

08:34.426 --> 08:36.298
I'm sorry, this
morning at the
service,

08:36.341 --> 08:39.127
it's just, things got too
real.

08:39.170 --> 08:41.085
Just quit while you're
ahead.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.046
We'll talk
tonight.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.092
Unless you get too
busy with work.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.444
I got to go. I'm
sorry.

08:52.488 --> 08:54.098
Okay.

09:20.342 --> 09:22.126
Jim, your
backpack.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.175
Thank
you.

09:27.218 --> 09:29.220
You didn't say a
word the whole drive
in.

09:32.223 --> 09:35.226
Sorry, I'm just not
feeling very talkative.

09:36.880 --> 09:40.754
We all knew
Erika, worked
with her...

09:40.797 --> 09:42.843
She meant a lot to all of
us.

09:42.886 --> 09:44.932
Especially Chris. Iunderstand all that.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.151
But there's something
else.

09:47.195 --> 09:49.023
You've been
tossing in your
sleep.

09:49.066 --> 09:51.242
Normally, that means
you're nervous about
something.

09:54.202 --> 09:55.638
Look, don't
worry about me.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.727
Okay?

09:57.771 --> 09:58.989
See you
later?

09:59.033 --> 10:02.036
Okay. I love
you.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.081
Love you,
too.

10:11.045 --> 10:13.351
Alonso. Need
a word with
you.

10:13.395 --> 10:16.006
Listen, until the FID
report comes back,

10:16.050 --> 10:17.921
everybody's
benched and on
desk duty.

10:17.965 --> 10:22.099
But you personally still
haven't been cleared to returnto HQ. Why not?

10:22.143 --> 10:24.406
Dr. Hughes hasn't signed
off on your psych eval.

10:24.449 --> 10:25.625
Well, that's crap. I'm
fine.

10:25.668 --> 10:26.669
She wants to see you
again.

10:26.713 --> 10:27.714
Said she has some
reservations.

10:27.757 --> 10:30.194
Reservations? Like
what, exactly?

10:30.238 --> 10:31.631
I'm not the
shrink.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.023
But maybe you living with
Erika is a factor.

10:33.067 --> 10:35.547
And until the
issue's
resolved

10:35.591 --> 10:37.027
to the satisfaction of the
doc,

10:37.071 --> 10:38.638
I have to abide by her
recommendations.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.684
Understood,
Commander.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.262
Guys,
focus!

10:55.306 --> 10:57.134
Durham, monkey grip,
man.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.093
Why they call 'em
"monkey bars." Let's
go!

10:59.136 --> 11:01.269
Thanks for letting
me stand in for you,

11:01.312 --> 11:02.792
supervise the
candidates.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.098
Well, if you're
gonna be on desk
duty,

11:04.141 --> 11:06.143
might as well
be of some
use.

11:06.187 --> 11:08.102
What round are theyon? Ten.

11:08.145 --> 11:09.843
Let's go,
Malhotra.

11:09.886 --> 11:12.106
Get upthere.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.198
Stop
this.

11:17.241 --> 11:18.895
What are you two
doing?

11:18.939 --> 11:20.288
Trying to be the best
versions of
ourselves.

11:20.331 --> 11:22.333
It's a rhetorical question,
man.

11:22.377 --> 11:23.987
You're both trying to make
it onto SWAT, okay?

11:24.031 --> 11:26.903
You think this is hard, wait
till you get out in the
field.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.600
It can be,
uh... it can be
rough.

11:28.644 --> 11:29.993
And we need to
know

11:30.037 --> 11:32.039
you can deal with
that. You guys got it?

11:33.127 --> 11:34.302
It's not
rhetorical. You
guys got it?

11:34.345 --> 11:35.303
Yes,sir.
Yes,
sir.

11:35.346 --> 11:37.871
Let's
go.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.220
Hey,
Durham,

11:39.263 --> 11:41.222
listen, I know you're
tired.

11:41.265 --> 11:43.790
Don't think of that as
weight.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.617
Think of that as a
life.

11:45.661 --> 11:47.445
All right?
It's
mental.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.231
You get over that
wall, they survive.

11:50.274 --> 11:52.233
Calibrate. Let's
go. You can do it.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.191
Copy that, will do.
Thanks, Sergeant
Kay.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.237
Let's
go.

11:57.238 --> 12:00.545
Riding them prettyhard. Shouldn't I?

12:00.589 --> 12:03.505
Thought we were gonna ease
up the last week of SWAT
school.

12:03.548 --> 12:05.289
It's not that kind of
week.

12:11.382 --> 12:13.384
Chris. I know youwanted to see me
again, but, uh,

12:13.428 --> 12:16.605
I think I deserve to be back
in HQ with the rest of my
team.

12:16.648 --> 12:20.609
I have
reservations.

12:20.652 --> 12:23.394
I learned that you
personally lobbied for Erika

12:23.438 --> 12:26.397
to fill in on 20-Squad the
day that she got killed.

12:26.441 --> 12:27.747
I want to make
sure

12:27.790 --> 12:29.270
you don't have any
self-condemnation

12:29.313 --> 12:30.837
or guilt about
that.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.752
I appreciate it,
Doc, but I'm good to
go.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.666
I don't need another psych
eval.

12:34.710 --> 12:37.147
You two were
roommates. I, uh, I
imagine

12:37.191 --> 12:38.932
you were very
close.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.542
We just moved
into that
place.

12:40.585 --> 12:43.850
And all of her belongings
are still at your
apartment.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.852
You see them every
time you go back home.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.375
How does that
make you
feel?

12:49.594 --> 12:53.337
You haven't been back
home since Erika was
killed.

12:53.381 --> 12:54.599
Is that
right?

12:54.643 --> 12:56.514
Does any of that really
matter?

12:56.558 --> 12:58.081
Where have you been
spending your
nights?

12:58.125 --> 12:59.691
At my uncle'shouse. Chris.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.171
You need to go
home.

13:01.215 --> 13:04.958
Why? This is
home.

13:05.001 --> 13:07.830
And I'm here, and I
can help my team

13:07.874 --> 13:11.616
back out in the field
once the FID report
drops.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.575
Who's gonna pack
up Erika's
belongings?

13:13.618 --> 13:15.446
How are you supposed to move
on?

13:15.490 --> 13:16.752
In order to deal with
this,

13:16.796 --> 13:18.623
you need to go
back to where you
live.

13:18.667 --> 13:22.018
And if that means it takes
more time, so be it,

13:22.062 --> 13:23.803
but I can't sign off on
you

13:23.846 --> 13:26.196
until you can process
this situation.

13:27.371 --> 13:28.677
Do you understand
what I'm telling
you?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.419
Yeah.

13:31.462 --> 13:32.594
I got
it.

13:32.637 --> 13:33.856
Good.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.379
Come talk to me
tomorrow.

13:35.423 --> 13:37.120
I want to help you through
this.

13:38.382 --> 13:40.689
Do you have
anything to help me
sleep?

13:47.696 --> 13:50.046
Yo,
Deac.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.526
Listen,
um,

13:51.569 --> 13:52.657
I was hoping you could
help me out with
something.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.616
Sure. What do
you need?

13:54.659 --> 13:56.400
FID did a walk-through of the
Imperial Dukes' compound,

13:56.444 --> 13:58.098
but I want to do one of my
own,

13:58.141 --> 14:00.491
and I could really use a
pair of fresh eyes on it.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.493
FID's report
comes out later
today.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.756
What difference does it
make if you and I walk
it?

14:04.800 --> 14:06.846
I need to know that the
team did everything right.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.764
You, uh, you clear
this with Hicks?

14:12.808 --> 14:14.810
Yeah. Look, we can take
two cars

14:14.854 --> 14:17.160
just in case you get
called into the field.

14:18.248 --> 14:21.338
Deacon, you weren't there,
man.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.297
It was tough to
see.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.995
And I want to make sure we
did everything right by
Erika.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.303
Yeah, of course.
Whatever you
need.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.348
Appreciate
you.

14:40.792 --> 14:44.187
The way we
entered, in tight
formation,

14:44.231 --> 14:46.537
it was our best approach
given the intel that we
had.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.365
No, I know the four-side entry
made sense.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.454
It gave you
cover on the
approach.

14:50.498 --> 14:53.457
But a breach from the
front

14:53.501 --> 14:56.069
might have prevented
McConnell from fleeing
upstairs.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.635
You've already studied
this place on your
own.

14:57.679 --> 15:00.943
Yeah. I read
everyone's after
action reports.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.553
Did a virtual
walkthrough of the crime
scene.

15:02.597 --> 15:06.035
Just to get the
facts. It's nothing
personal.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.645
I'm not auditing your
work.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.299
But you think I did
something wrong. No,it's...

15:09.343 --> 15:11.345
it's not that
clear.

15:11.388 --> 15:13.913
Deacon, when we
breached, I had to pick
between

15:13.956 --> 15:17.351
two different
approaches based on
limited intel.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.135
If you were team
leader,

15:19.179 --> 15:20.441
would you have
made the other
call?

15:20.484 --> 15:22.312
Doesn't
matter.

15:22.356 --> 15:24.445
Neither option was 100%
safe.

15:24.488 --> 15:28.014
The fact is another
approach could have been
utilized,

15:28.057 --> 15:29.711
and FID might use
that against us.

15:29.754 --> 15:32.453
Because they have the benefit
of having all the information
now.

15:32.496 --> 15:35.499
I know it's hard waiting
on an FID decision.

15:35.543 --> 15:38.546
But nothing you or I
do at this point

15:38.589 --> 15:40.722
is gonna affect the
outcome of their
investigation.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.074
Maybe we can do
something other than
play

15:45.118 --> 15:46.467
Monday morning
quarterback.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.251
The white
nationalists who
killed Erika--

15:48.295 --> 15:50.688
the Imperial Dukes--
they're a terrorist
group

15:50.732 --> 15:51.994
that operates
through independent
cells

15:52.038 --> 15:53.604
made up of four
to eight
members.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.345
Now, we've already
taken down four of
them,

15:55.389 --> 15:57.565
but I can't shake the
feeling that there's more
out there.

15:57.608 --> 16:00.133
And to find them, I want to
search every inch of this
place.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.525
Maybe we can get a
lead on more members.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.353
Possibly another
cell.

16:07.531 --> 16:09.533
From what I've
read, the Imperial
Dukes

16:09.577 --> 16:11.013
pervert Christian
beliefs.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.494
They claim they're
fighting a holy race war

16:13.537 --> 16:15.452
that's happening
everywhere in the
shadows.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.324
With their pop
culture references,

16:17.367 --> 16:19.456
their dog whistletactics... They see any
kind of change,

16:19.500 --> 16:22.590
any shift in power, as a
threat.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.070
Deacon, if we had
come from this
direction,

16:24.113 --> 16:25.593
we would have breached the
house from the front.

16:25.636 --> 16:26.898
And we might have been
able to keep McConnell

16:26.942 --> 16:28.596
from going up those
stairs.

16:28.639 --> 16:29.901
And we would have seen that
some of these shell casings

16:29.945 --> 16:31.773
were for armor-piercing
rounds.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.775
Hondo, it's tough to
tell from these.

16:33.818 --> 16:34.906
You didn't know what you
were fully up against

16:34.950 --> 16:36.691
until Erika took a
5.56 to the chest.

16:36.734 --> 16:39.520
Anything else you learn
from your deep dive
earlier?

16:40.825 --> 16:42.523
I get why everyone's on
edge,

16:42.566 --> 16:46.005
but y-you don't normally
second-guess yourself like
this.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.007
I don't normally get one
of my own killed.

16:50.922 --> 16:54.491
It was your bullet
that hit Abel
McConnell.

16:54.535 --> 16:58.060
You killed the
guy that killed
Erika.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.670
You're the one
that took him
out.

16:59.714 --> 17:01.150
That's got to
give you some
solace.

17:01.194 --> 17:03.022
It
doesn't.

17:12.553 --> 17:13.815
Wait a
minute.

17:13.858 --> 17:15.077
What?

17:15.121 --> 17:18.646
Target positions.
The cover
pattern.

17:18.689 --> 17:21.388
The dimensions of the
alley. I know this layout.

17:21.431 --> 17:23.129
This training course is
exactly like one at Pendleton.

17:23.172 --> 17:24.391
It's a carbon copy,
man.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.480
Whoever built
this might have
served

17:26.523 --> 17:28.177
in the Marines
around the same timeI did. I'm sure the
feds

17:28.221 --> 17:30.397
picked up on that? No, no,don't be so sure, Deac.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.660
Pendleton updates its
courses every few years.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.705
This is an old
layout.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.098
Whoever built it
served when I
did.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.143
-Sounds like a lead.
-You're damn
straight.

17:42.452 --> 17:45.194
Been working off Hondo's
theory.

17:45.238 --> 17:46.891
None of the four Imperial
Dukes we took down three days
ago

17:46.935 --> 17:48.458
served in the
Marines.

17:48.502 --> 17:49.677
So if none of these guys
built the training
course,

17:49.720 --> 17:51.244
our builder's still out
there.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.897
Started a
profile on our
suspect.

17:52.941 --> 17:56.466
Cross-checked white males in
their 40s with carpentry
skills

17:56.510 --> 17:58.599
against Marine Corps
-enrollment for L.
-A.
County.

17:58.642 --> 18:01.080
That description doesn't
exactly narrow things
down.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.603
Almost 2,000 guys fit the
bill.

18:02.646 --> 18:05.388
But I found something
that might help us.
Look.

18:05.432 --> 18:07.782
Erika's funeral wasn't the
only one scheduled for
today.

18:07.825 --> 18:10.611
Abel McConnell, the Imperial
Duke who killed Erika,

18:10.654 --> 18:13.440
his funeral's thisafternoon. The FBI is
already

18:13.483 --> 18:16.356
staking out the small group
expected to turn out in
person,

18:16.399 --> 18:18.140
but this funeral is also
being livestreamed.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.837
If we can get a warrant, we
can stake it out
electronically.

18:19.881 --> 18:22.449
Anyone who's attending
could be an Imperial
Duke

18:22.492 --> 18:24.190
or our course
builder.

18:24.233 --> 18:28.019
I'm tired of it,
and so is the city
council.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.934
This isn't the first time our
mayor has made Los Angeles

18:29.978 --> 18:32.633
front-page news for all
the wrong reasons.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.548
There was a period
of time two
year...

18:34.591 --> 18:36.724
I just came from city
hall.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.856
How's the mayor taking
him politicizing a
tragedy?

18:38.900 --> 18:40.423
She didn't
say.

18:40.467 --> 18:41.685
She does want
me to notify
her

18:41.729 --> 18:44.079
about the FID report
as soon as it comes
in.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.473
Well, that's an interesting
way of saying she's got our
backs.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.475
The mayor's in a tough
spot.

18:48.518 --> 18:50.259
Some people are
calling for her to
resign.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.783
So SWAT's being used in a
political chess match,

18:52.827 --> 18:55.264
and she's already thinking
about how to protect
herself?

18:55.308 --> 18:57.440
By sacrificing one of my
pieces?

18:57.484 --> 18:59.486
She's a politician. Erika's
death affects her, too,

18:59.529 --> 19:00.791
in a different
way.

19:00.835 --> 19:02.489
It takes a certain
kind of officer

19:02.532 --> 19:04.926
to go through Erika's death
three days ago,

19:04.969 --> 19:07.146
and then show up here the
same day of her funeral.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.931
They're not pawns.
They're human
beings.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.672
The mayor knows what you
all went through that
day.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.456
She doesn't want FID's
report to be a problem

19:13.500 --> 19:14.718
any more than you
do.

19:14.762 --> 19:17.460
I can think of someone who
does.

19:27.340 --> 19:28.515
If you can
fast-track that
warrant,

19:28.558 --> 19:30.691
we'll be ready to
observe from our end.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.519
All right. Thanks,
Agent Carr.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.260
Sergeant
Kay.

19:34.303 --> 19:36.218
Hey, I just wanted to say
I appreciated that pep
talk

19:36.262 --> 19:38.177
out there this morning. This
has been the toughest week
yet.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.613
I'm glad I could
help.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.658
Listen, keep pushing
yourself, finish strong,

19:41.702 --> 19:43.094
you'll be out in the field
soon.

19:43.138 --> 19:45.009
Hey, look, I know
it's not my
place,

19:45.053 --> 19:46.576
but I get what
happened out
there.

19:46.620 --> 19:47.577
And I feel for what you
and your team

19:47.621 --> 19:48.709
are going through right
now.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.319
Thank you. It's
been tough.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.538
I just think
that, with who
you are,

19:51.581 --> 19:53.235
if you would've been
there,

19:53.279 --> 19:54.541
things could've
panned out
differently.

19:54.584 --> 19:57.544
They really missed your
leadership that day.

19:57.587 --> 19:59.502
Appreciatethat. Yeah.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.463
Durham's making the
strongest case so
far.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.378
Just ahead of
Malhotra.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.075
Yeah. Kid's got a good
heart.

20:07.118 --> 20:08.859
He's just got to
keep his head down.

20:08.903 --> 20:10.383
How you holding
up?

20:10.426 --> 20:12.950
I've been organizing food
for Erika's extended
family.

20:12.994 --> 20:15.605
I had to help them. I just
needed something positive

20:15.649 --> 20:18.391
to put my mind to
the past few days.

20:18.434 --> 20:19.653
Late night, been
going to the gym,

20:19.696 --> 20:21.350
hitting the bag till
my arms give out.

20:21.394 --> 20:22.786
It's the only way I
can get any sleep.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.223
Sounds like you're
heading in the right
direction.

20:24.266 --> 20:27.400
Yeah. Yeah, thanks for
checking on me, Deac.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.793
I hope we can all get out in
the field together soon.

20:29.837 --> 20:31.665
Pretty sure that's
what Erika would want.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.536
Aside from
justice.

20:33.580 --> 20:37.627
Yeah. God willing, it
works out that way, huh?

20:37.671 --> 20:39.325
Let me know if you
need anything.

20:39.368 --> 20:40.630
Yeah. I
will.

20:45.896 --> 20:49.596
How many people out there--
lawyers, grocers,
mechanics--

20:49.639 --> 20:51.162
moonlight as white
nationalists?

20:51.206 --> 20:52.860
They just look
like regular
people.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.470
That's what's
frightening.

20:54.514 --> 20:56.472
Six people are
attending in person.

20:56.516 --> 20:58.518
78 logged on
remotely.

21:00.128 --> 21:02.304
Anything on our
anonymous attendees?

21:02.348 --> 21:03.871
Looking at
'em.

21:03.914 --> 21:05.742
Ten of them are using
VPNs to hide their
identities.

21:05.786 --> 21:07.570
Now, I thought that
seemed a little too
high-tech

21:07.614 --> 21:08.745
for our builder at
first.

21:08.789 --> 21:09.746
It could also mean
that he's getting
help

21:09.790 --> 21:11.792
from other Imperial
Dukes.

21:11.835 --> 21:14.098
Okay, wait a minute.
This could be
something.

21:14.142 --> 21:17.319
One of the client ISPs is
registered to Landon
McBride.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.800
He's a former
Marine.

21:19.843 --> 21:21.802
Two tours in
Afghanistan.

21:21.845 --> 21:23.194
And he was at
Pendleton

21:23.238 --> 21:24.761
when that same
training course was
up, Deac.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.197
Received a
dishonorable
discharge,

21:26.241 --> 21:27.503
and he's got a
jacket.

21:27.547 --> 21:29.592
Prior for a felony
unlawful use of a
weapon,

21:29.636 --> 21:31.333
and he's got an
outstanding warrant for
the assault.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.117
Gives us a
reason to talk
to him.

21:33.161 --> 21:34.684
That's his last known
address.

21:34.728 --> 21:36.686
I'm still on desk duty, Deac.
I can't roll on this, just
you.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.166
All right, I'll
grab a patrol
officer.

21:38.209 --> 21:39.254
I'll call you from the
house.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.647
I'll check
McBride's tax
records,

21:40.690 --> 21:42.301
see what they turn
up.

21:45.956 --> 21:47.784
Ma'am. I'm Sergeant
Kay,

21:47.828 --> 21:49.090
LAPD.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.221
Looking for Landon
McBride.

21:50.265 --> 21:52.963
I kicked him out
four months
back.

21:53.007 --> 21:54.704
What'd he do
now?

21:54.748 --> 21:55.923
We've got reason to
believe that he helped
some people

21:55.966 --> 21:58.360
murder a police
officer three days
ago.

21:59.796 --> 22:01.755
My
God.

22:01.798 --> 22:03.496
Does this have
anything to do with

22:03.539 --> 22:04.845
that online group hejoined? Possibly.

22:04.888 --> 22:06.673
Did he ever refer to it by
name?

22:06.716 --> 22:10.416
Did he ever mention a
group called the ImperialDukes? No.

22:10.459 --> 22:12.287
Look, I'm
sorry, I want
to help,

22:12.331 --> 22:13.941
but I broke off all
contact with him

22:13.984 --> 22:15.856
after he assaulted a
protester.

22:15.899 --> 22:18.380
But it sounds
like he
escalated.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.643
Got worse over
the last few
months.

22:20.687 --> 22:22.036
You have any idea
where he might
be?

22:22.079 --> 22:24.430
Any friends or
colleagues he's hanging
out with?

22:24.473 --> 22:26.736
He leave anything
behind?

22:26.780 --> 22:28.172
No, I tossed all his
crap.

22:28.216 --> 22:29.522
His drafting
table, schematics.

22:29.565 --> 22:31.698
Your boyfriend was abuilder? Ex-boyfriend.

22:31.741 --> 22:36.267
He was all right until
he got laid off last
year.

22:36.311 --> 22:38.879
Told me he was pushed
out in favor of other
people.

22:38.922 --> 22:41.490
Said new hiring quotas
discriminated against
him.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.710
I'm sure it was a bit more
complicated than that,

22:43.753 --> 22:45.842
but Landon is a simple
man.

22:45.886 --> 22:48.541
I'm guessing he went down
the rabbit hole afterthat? Yeah.

22:48.584 --> 22:49.803
Wasn't long before he
found that online
group.

22:49.846 --> 22:51.935
They fed his
anger,

22:51.979 --> 22:55.548
forced some ugly
tattoos on him
and...

22:55.591 --> 22:57.724
well, pushed him
down a darker
path.

22:57.767 --> 22:59.682
That
laptop.

22:59.726 --> 23:01.380
It's a few years
old.

23:01.423 --> 23:03.991
You two shareit? Yeah.

23:04.034 --> 23:05.906
His account's
password protected,
though.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.124
I don't know
it.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.567
Hey, Chris, what's
up?

23:14.610 --> 23:17.613
I know it's late there. I
shouldn't have called. My bad.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.833
You talk to Dr. Wendytoday? Yeah.

23:19.876 --> 23:21.487
We got a path laid
out.

23:21.530 --> 23:22.923
Gonna try it again
tomorrow.

23:22.966 --> 23:25.360
Good. Means you're
heading in the right
direction.

23:25.404 --> 23:28.624
Are you okay,
Chris? Where are
you?

23:28.668 --> 23:32.802
I'm outside of my
apartment. In the hallway.

23:32.846 --> 23:34.151
You're
stalling.

23:34.195 --> 23:37.328
You've got to go in
and pack Erika's
stuff.

23:37.372 --> 23:41.724
And as hard as it is,
You've got to handle
it.

23:41.768 --> 23:43.378
I know you learned some
German when you were in K-9.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.598
You know, I've been
hanging out with these
guys

23:45.641 --> 23:47.338
that have been teaching
me single German words

23:47.382 --> 23:51.473
that actually mean full
sentences in English. It's
wild.

23:51.517 --> 23:52.953
<i>Kopf hoch.
Yeah.</i>

23:52.996 --> 23:55.477
It means, uh, to keep your
head held high.

23:55.521 --> 23:58.045
That's right. It made
me think of you.

23:58.088 --> 24:01.527
'Cause you always
keep your head up,
Chris.

24:01.570 --> 24:03.659
Now, come
on.

24:03.703 --> 24:05.487
You got
this.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.143
Got McBride's tax
records.

24:09.186 --> 24:10.971
He's a freelance
contractor.

24:11.014 --> 24:13.669
Hired to work four
construction sites in the last
quarter.

24:13.713 --> 24:16.455
Put out a BOLO, unis see him at
any of the sites, we'll know.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.413
His girl's
laptop give us
anything?

24:18.457 --> 24:20.502
FBI got us into
McBride's
account.

24:20.546 --> 24:21.677
He's definitely
been taking
pointers

24:21.721 --> 24:23.374
from someone who's tech
savvy.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.376
He's tried to cover his
tracks by drafting.

24:25.420 --> 24:26.813
Puts messages in a
folder,

24:26.856 --> 24:29.903
allows recipients to log in
and read 'em. Look.

24:29.946 --> 24:32.906
Which means
there's no send
receipts.

24:32.949 --> 24:35.996
But some of the unsent
drafts should still be
recoverable.

24:36.039 --> 24:37.432
Like messages
from his other
job.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.521
Building things for
the Imperial Dukes.

24:39.565 --> 24:42.393
McBride suggested
identical building
plans

24:42.437 --> 24:44.395
for two other training
courses.

24:44.439 --> 24:47.442
So there's potentially two
more Imperial Duke cells out
there.

24:48.791 --> 24:50.401
Even though none of
these messages have been
sent,

24:50.445 --> 24:51.925
can we find
out who read
'em?

24:51.968 --> 24:54.580
Well, there's at least
one person with a
login.

24:54.623 --> 24:57.670
Could be the person
coordinating the
cells.

24:57.713 --> 25:00.150
Imperial Dukesleader? Possibly.

25:00.194 --> 25:01.543
I'll have the
Feds do a deep
dive

25:01.587 --> 25:03.240
on the unidentified
login.

25:03.284 --> 25:05.112
BOLO got a hit on
McBride.

25:05.155 --> 25:06.635
Just got a call
from a patrol
unit

25:06.679 --> 25:08.768
sitting on a site
in City of
Industry.

25:08.811 --> 25:10.944
Saw McBride show
up, then rabbit.

25:10.987 --> 25:13.555
You better hurry, 'cause it's
an active high-speed chase
now.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.862
-Take Rocker with you, Deac.
-We'll get him for you,
Hondo.

25:15.905 --> 25:18.647
Not for me,
Deac. For Erika.

25:37.753 --> 25:39.886
Good work,
Rocker.

25:39.929 --> 25:41.452
Forcing him
north keeps him
in

25:41.496 --> 25:42.541
the industrial park,
away from the
freeway.

25:51.593 --> 25:52.551
Hondo, he's heading
east

25:52.594 --> 25:53.769
on a frontage
road.

25:53.813 --> 25:55.554
Roger that, Deac. We
got eyes in the air.

26:00.602 --> 26:01.821
Rocker,

26:01.864 --> 26:03.213
there's a
switchback up
ahead.

26:03.257 --> 26:04.650
It loops around to thesouth. Copy that.

26:17.706 --> 26:19.099
Whoa...
Hey!

26:37.726 --> 26:38.727
Nice work,
guys. He's
hemmed in.

26:41.643 --> 26:42.601
Suspect's
fleeing. We're in
foot pursuit.

26:44.254 --> 26:45.778
Freeze!
LAPD!

27:07.713 --> 27:10.193
There's a residential
neighborhood to the
north.

27:10.237 --> 27:12.456
You got to stop him before he
gets to any civilians.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.690
He's in
the camper

27:28.734 --> 27:30.170
up ahead. Now, he might have
barricaded

27:30.213 --> 27:31.780
himself inside, so be
careful.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.745
Landon
McBride, LAPD
SWAT.

27:39.788 --> 27:42.486
Come on out, right
now. Hands in the air.

27:44.619 --> 27:45.620
Real
slow.

27:48.579 --> 27:51.452
Hondo, cops on the scene
found designs of the Imperial
Dukes'

27:51.495 --> 27:52.975
training course in
McBride's truck.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.150
That might
explain why he
thought

27:54.194 --> 27:55.761
running from the
police was worth it.

27:55.804 --> 27:57.197
You guys copy
-that? Loud and clear,
-Hondo.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.807
Drop your phone, put
your hands behind your
head

27:58.851 --> 28:01.723
and get on your
knees. Do it now.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.638
Don't my rights
matter?

28:03.682 --> 28:05.814
Doesn't <i>my</i> life
matter?

28:05.858 --> 28:06.902
Erika
Rogers'

28:06.946 --> 28:07.903
life
mattered.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.731
Oh, the Black chick
cop.

28:09.775 --> 28:11.515
Yeah, I heard about
that.

28:11.559 --> 28:13.561
You built a training
course for white
nationalists.

28:13.604 --> 28:16.085
I'm proud of my
heritage. That isn't a
crime.

28:16.129 --> 28:18.740
At least not yet. Yourfriends shot and killed
a police officer.

28:18.784 --> 28:21.177
That's aiding and
abetting domestic
terrorism.

28:22.526 --> 28:23.614
Face down, on the
ground,

28:23.658 --> 28:24.703
now.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.107
He's not saying
anything.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.761
Because he doesn't
think he needs to.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.328
He doesn't
need to help
himself

28:41.371 --> 28:43.069
because, in his mind, the
Imperial Dukes are gonna win

28:43.112 --> 28:44.635
whatever war they're
trying to fight.

28:44.679 --> 28:46.899
He's a soldier and this is
the sacrifice he's making

28:46.942 --> 28:48.770
for the same lost
cause.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.119
We've got the FBI
looking to
identify

28:50.163 --> 28:52.426
the other hidden
login from McBride's
e-mail.

28:52.469 --> 28:53.557
Whoever this person
is,

28:53.601 --> 28:55.472
they are
intelligent and
cautious.

28:55.516 --> 28:56.822
If it's the Dukes'
leader organizing all
this,

28:56.865 --> 28:57.953
then we're gonna find
him.

28:57.997 --> 28:59.607
But let's stay in the
loop with the Feds

28:59.650 --> 29:01.522
and be ready to make a move
as soon as they get a solid
lead.

29:01.565 --> 29:02.741
Roger
that.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.220
Listen,
um...

29:05.831 --> 29:09.095
I'm sorry about
earlier, at the
compound.

29:09.138 --> 29:11.227
I undermined you by
double-checking theraid. No, Deac.

29:11.271 --> 29:13.882
You didn't. It's your duty
as a sergeant

29:13.926 --> 29:15.754
to see if you could have done
it better three days ago.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.799
Or at least know
better for the next
raid.

29:17.843 --> 29:20.019
It kills me that I
was on that school
tour

29:20.062 --> 29:21.411
and not with you and the
team.

29:21.455 --> 29:24.632
Everyone's dealing with
this in their own way, man.

29:24.675 --> 29:25.633
No one's
exempt.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.770
FID report's
in.

29:33.423 --> 29:34.990
Hey, Ed, what do we
got?

29:35.034 --> 29:37.123
Commander. I supposed you
want to read their
ruling?

29:39.734 --> 29:41.823
"In regards to the
events in question,

29:41.867 --> 29:45.044
"Force Investigation
Division finds 20-Squad's
actions

29:45.087 --> 29:46.785
"to have been within
policy.

29:46.828 --> 29:49.875
"It hereby gives no
recommendation for
discipline

29:49.918 --> 29:51.964
"in the planning or
execution of the raid

29:52.007 --> 29:55.141
"resulting in the deaths
of suspect Abel
McConnell

29:55.184 --> 29:56.707
and Officer Erika
Rogers."

29:56.751 --> 29:58.274
All right, so we're
approved for field duty
again?

29:58.318 --> 30:00.668
Well, Alonso still
needs to earn clearance

30:00.711 --> 30:02.452
from Dr. Hughes,
but the rest of
you

30:02.496 --> 30:03.714
are officially on
call.

30:06.326 --> 30:08.937
-What is it,
-Commander? There's
more.

30:08.981 --> 30:12.071
"It is, however, our
opinion that other
strategies

30:12.114 --> 30:14.638
"could have been
utilized in the raid.

30:14.682 --> 30:16.379
"Alternative
actions may have
produced

30:16.423 --> 30:18.947
different results, and loss of
life may have been averted."

30:18.991 --> 30:21.210
You got to be kidding
me.

30:21.254 --> 30:23.125
They're leaving
us in a gray
area.

30:23.169 --> 30:24.866
Sir, even with other
strategiesavailable,

30:24.910 --> 30:26.041
they know that
there was
nothing

30:26.085 --> 30:27.347
that could have
guaranteed
success.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.001
Hondo's right,
Commander.

30:29.044 --> 30:30.785
This clears the
team.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.874
Lieutenant Lynch is on her
way.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.702
We may have been
cleared
technically,

30:34.745 --> 30:37.836
but according to the
mayor, not politically. Sowhat happens now?

30:37.879 --> 30:39.838
I think another
shoe's about to drop.

30:45.278 --> 30:46.670
<i>Honestly,</i>

30:46.714 --> 30:48.890
even with FID clearing
us,

30:48.934 --> 30:51.110
it doesn't make Erika's
death any easier.

30:51.153 --> 30:53.895
Or maybe it's not supposed
to.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.723
It finally hit
me.

30:55.766 --> 30:58.552
She's gone,
man. Forever.

30:58.595 --> 31:00.771
Part of me still
doesn't want to accept
it.

31:00.815 --> 31:03.339
Listen...

31:03.383 --> 31:06.908
after I lost
Nate, it was
brutal.

31:06.952 --> 31:10.303
I found out that
grief doesn't go
away.

31:10.346 --> 31:12.305
It
stays.

31:12.348 --> 31:14.394
Some days it's
heavier than
others.

31:14.437 --> 31:16.613
But hopefully, on
those heavy days

31:16.657 --> 31:18.920
you got people beside you that
can help lighten the load.

31:20.487 --> 31:22.924
Shockingly
insightful for a guy
like you.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.491
Well, Dr. Hughes
said that last
part.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.188
I'm just filling you
in.

31:26.232 --> 31:29.800
I guess we should be
thankful we can keep doing
our jobs.

31:29.844 --> 31:31.759
Tell the people we care
about how important they
are.

31:31.802 --> 31:34.544
Yeah. Allright.

32:02.007 --> 32:04.009
Although SWAT was
cleared,

32:04.052 --> 32:06.968
the possibility the team
could have done things
differently

32:07.012 --> 32:08.317
and avoided two
people getting killed

32:08.361 --> 32:10.232
is enough to increase
pressure on the mayor.

32:10.276 --> 32:12.974
Hondo made the best of
two imperfect choices.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.281
There was no risk-free
option.

32:15.324 --> 32:17.109
Doesn't
matter. Not
now.

32:18.284 --> 32:19.981
The death of one of our
few African-American

32:20.025 --> 32:21.983
female officers is
not a good look.

32:22.027 --> 32:24.507
Is that what this is all
about?

32:24.551 --> 32:26.379
How it
looks?

32:26.422 --> 32:28.947
We just lost a
colleague. A friend.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.818
I'm sorry, but the mayor
wants a scalp.

32:32.254 --> 32:33.995
And it needs to be
someone on the
team

32:34.039 --> 32:36.998
or someone in command that
suggests accountability.

32:38.652 --> 32:39.827
I'm not happy
delivering the
message.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.611
But you agree with
it.

32:41.655 --> 32:44.440
No. But that's the
message.

32:44.484 --> 32:47.052
And I'll leave it up to you to
decide who it is, Commander.

32:49.619 --> 32:51.970
I'm not giving you
anyone from the team.

32:54.929 --> 32:56.931
So...

32:58.977 --> 33:01.805
...I guess the scalp
will have to be
mine.

33:08.421 --> 33:09.770
What's going on in
here?

33:11.424 --> 33:13.426
Sounds like I have to
resign.

33:14.470 --> 33:16.037
Like
hell you do.

33:16.081 --> 33:18.300
Hondo, this is
political fallout we're
facing.

33:18.344 --> 33:20.737
The mayor's
hand is beingforced.
Lieutenant,

33:20.781 --> 33:21.869
Commander Hicks isn't
responsible for anything

33:21.912 --> 33:23.566
that happened three days
ago.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.916
No offense, but this is way
above your pay grade,
Sergeant.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.440
Is
it?

33:27.483 --> 33:28.789
Let me tell you
something, Lieutenant.

33:30.095 --> 33:32.358
The men and women who take
risks in the field--

33:32.401 --> 33:33.707
we live in a
completely different
world

33:33.750 --> 33:35.926
than the
politicians who
criticize us.

33:35.970 --> 33:37.885
We are constantly
thrown into situations

33:37.928 --> 33:39.234
where there is a
one percent chance

33:39.278 --> 33:41.715
of things going horriblywrong. That's duly noted.

33:41.758 --> 33:42.977
Well, you put us in
those situations often
enough,

33:43.021 --> 33:45.240
that one percent
is gonna come
up,

33:45.284 --> 33:47.025
and it came up three days
ago.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.201
The mayor can
pretend all she
wants

33:49.244 --> 33:50.376
that it's a
problem with
leadership,

33:50.419 --> 33:52.160
but I promise you,
on everything I
am,

33:52.204 --> 33:54.945
that game could
backfire on herass. Excuse me?

33:55.990 --> 33:58.732
Hicks stays or I
go.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.040
And the first place I'm gonna
-go is to the <i>L.
-A. Times</i>

34:02.083 --> 34:03.215
and I'm-a talk about the
real systemic problems

34:03.258 --> 34:04.999
within the LAPD that
she,

34:05.043 --> 34:07.219
the commission and the
union still ignore.

34:08.698 --> 34:10.744
And I imagine they
might even want

34:10.787 --> 34:13.399
to run my picture with
it.

34:21.059 --> 34:24.062
I imagine this'll be a
tough conversation with the
mayor.

34:24.105 --> 34:27.065
Maybe we need to have
more tough
conversations.

34:32.157 --> 34:36.117
I know we haven't
always seen eye to
eye,

34:36.161 --> 34:38.206
but I admire the
stances you've both
taken here.

34:40.556 --> 34:42.428
It's
admirable.

34:43.951 --> 34:45.953
And
frustrating.

34:52.351 --> 34:53.874
You didn't have to do
that.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.876
Yes, I
did.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.514
Hang on a second,
Latasha.

35:36.221 --> 35:38.179
Thought you were Erika's
sister.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.485
Can I come
in?

35:43.271 --> 35:45.839
Just wanted to
check up on you.

35:45.882 --> 35:48.624
See how you were
doing.

35:49.669 --> 35:52.846
I'm, uh... I'm
dealing.

35:52.889 --> 35:55.588
I just keep
thinking
it's...

35:55.631 --> 35:58.547
it's not fair, Erika
dying.

35:58.591 --> 36:00.070
I know. I
hate it.

36:00.114 --> 36:02.812
And I've hated
myself the past
three days.

36:04.205 --> 36:06.164
Been tossing and
turning in my
sleep.

36:07.208 --> 36:09.167
It's been weighing on
me.

36:09.210 --> 36:11.081
What
has?

36:12.082 --> 36:14.215
When Erika went
down,

36:14.259 --> 36:18.828
initially I didn't
feel shock or
sadness.

36:18.872 --> 36:20.526
I was just
relieved

36:20.569 --> 36:23.137
that it wasn't
you.

36:24.965 --> 36:26.923
Chris, if you
took that
bullet

36:26.967 --> 36:28.621
and I lost
you...

36:28.664 --> 36:31.537
I wouldn't have
recovered.

36:32.581 --> 36:34.409
I know our
situation

36:34.453 --> 36:36.150
is
impossible.

36:36.194 --> 36:39.109
I was on my way home to
Molly when I came here
instead.

36:39.153 --> 36:41.242
But being with her feels
wrong.

36:41.286 --> 36:42.548
Stop.

36:42.591 --> 36:43.940
'Cause all I think
about is being with
you.

36:43.984 --> 36:45.333
Why are you telling me
this?

36:45.377 --> 36:46.813
Just...

36:46.856 --> 36:48.467
Please
leave.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.208
Chris...

36:50.251 --> 36:52.949
Leave.
Now.

36:58.868 --> 37:01.393
-Chris.
-Please
go.

37:08.791 --> 37:12.404
Hi.

37:14.406 --> 37:17.887
I love you.
You know
that.

37:18.932 --> 37:20.586
Of course I
do.

37:20.629 --> 37:23.284
You and the
kids--

37:23.328 --> 37:25.286
you're everything to
me.

37:29.334 --> 37:31.074
What happened
today?

37:31.118 --> 37:34.469
Well, we grabbed another
one of the Imperial Dukes.

37:34.513 --> 37:36.863
Well, that's
great. Right?

37:36.906 --> 37:39.648
Yeah.

37:39.692 --> 37:41.259
But,
uh...

37:43.261 --> 37:45.263
...my team is
broken.

37:49.354 --> 37:51.486
I don't know if we're
gonna be okay

37:51.530 --> 37:55.621
until we... we
grab every last
one

37:55.664 --> 37:57.536
of this
crew.

37:57.579 --> 38:00.713
So you don't want to
retire.

38:00.756 --> 38:03.629
I can't leave my
team.

38:03.672 --> 38:05.239
Not like
this.

38:11.593 --> 38:13.552
Annie...

38:15.554 --> 38:16.816
...you're my
family.

38:18.818 --> 38:21.081
And so are
they.

38:23.083 --> 38:26.565
And I think God put me
here

38:26.608 --> 38:28.218
so I can help
them.

38:42.711 --> 38:44.670
-Hey.
-Hey.

38:44.713 --> 38:47.803
I just thought I'd drop
by for a surprise
visit,

38:47.847 --> 38:49.065
if that's
okay.

38:49.109 --> 38:50.676
It was an open
invitation.

38:50.719 --> 38:52.242
Hm.

38:52.286 --> 38:53.853
What is
it?

38:56.029 --> 38:58.597
Nichelle,
uh...

39:01.861 --> 39:05.168
I haven't been as
open with you as I
should.

39:06.431 --> 39:09.347
I want to tell
you something
that...

39:09.390 --> 39:11.349
I probably wouldn't
tell anyone else.

39:13.699 --> 39:16.310
I'd be lying if I
said these past three
days

39:16.354 --> 39:18.094
haven't been some of
the toughest.

39:18.138 --> 39:21.315
You lost a friend.
That can't be
easy.

39:21.359 --> 39:25.972
It's just, this past
year, with...

39:26.015 --> 39:28.975
with police
misconduct,

39:29.018 --> 39:31.238
Black folks getting
killed on camera...

39:33.196 --> 39:36.330
...and losing an
officer in the field,
it just,

39:36.374 --> 39:38.158
it cuts
deep.

39:40.813 --> 39:43.468
And now I got doubts
about whether the
fight

39:43.511 --> 39:47.254
to change things
is even worth
it.

39:48.298 --> 39:50.431
It's natural to have
doubts

39:50.475 --> 39:53.216
when you're trying to make a
difference in people's lives.

39:53.260 --> 39:54.566
I get it,
Hondo.

39:54.609 --> 39:57.220
But this-- I
mean,

39:57.264 --> 40:00.789
it's got me wondering
about myself as a police
officer,

40:00.833 --> 40:04.314
as a
leader

40:04.358 --> 40:06.839
and as a Black man
in this damn
world.

40:11.104 --> 40:12.410
I threatened to resign
today.

40:14.063 --> 40:16.718
To protect someone
else.

40:16.762 --> 40:18.764
I was willing to lose
SWAT.

40:20.505 --> 40:22.594
And they don't know
it, but I was not
bluffing.

40:22.637 --> 40:24.422
So what
happened?

40:25.727 --> 40:28.426
The mayor backed
down.

40:28.469 --> 40:31.559
So the heat's off of
us, for now.

40:31.603 --> 40:34.432
You felt like you had to
sacrifice yourself

40:34.475 --> 40:35.955
to make a
difference?

40:35.998 --> 40:38.261
Yeah.

40:38.305 --> 40:40.481
Yeah, because if we're all
out there trying to change
things

40:40.525 --> 40:42.614
for the better, then why
did Erika Rogers

40:42.657 --> 40:44.442
have to pay a bigger
price?

40:44.485 --> 40:46.400
Hondo, you can't
let that eat at
you.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.097
It'll only wear you
down.

40:51.318 --> 40:54.974
How do you manage to push
through all the noise?

40:55.017 --> 40:57.672
Or maybe it's just looking
fearless just comes
naturally.

40:59.892 --> 41:03.548
Maybe I feel the same
things you feel.

41:03.591 --> 41:06.942
I just try to get it
out, talk it through,

41:06.986 --> 41:08.988
like we're doing right
now.

41:12.382 --> 41:13.906
Do you hear
that?

41:15.908 --> 41:17.649
No. I don't hear
anything.

41:17.692 --> 41:20.608
That's what I'm talking
about.

41:20.652 --> 41:22.523
See? You're pushing
through the noise already.

41:24.786 --> 41:28.834
A good leader has
self-awareness

41:28.877 --> 41:32.707
and the desire to do
better, be better.

41:32.751 --> 41:36.885
Insecurities don't make
anyone less of a leader,
Hondo.

41:36.929 --> 41:39.279
They make 'em
human.

41:41.542 --> 41:44.632
This is good,
talking it
through.

41:44.676 --> 41:48.288
Yeah, you should
try it moreoften.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.597
Well, you available for any
more surprise visits?
