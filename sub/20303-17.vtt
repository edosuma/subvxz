NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:05.547 --> 00:08.049
You promised me
you weren't gonna be that kind of cop.

00:08.341 --> 00:09.259
I know.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.886
Oh, for God's sake, Henry,
what were you trying to prove?

00:11.970 --> 00:13.638
Rachel and I are getting a divorce.

00:13.722 --> 00:16.224
I just can't keep
going through the motions, Frank.

00:16.599 --> 00:18.685
Damn it to hell!

00:18.768 --> 00:20.645
-RENKO: Daddy--
-TRACY:<i> He's got six weeks.</i>

00:20.729 --> 00:22.355
Everyone knows it but him.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.858
It isn't right.
If he wants to go home, he should go home.

00:24.941 --> 00:28.111
You don't get radiation
and chemotherapy at home.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.155
I went from a fifth a day
to nearly seven--

00:30.238 --> 00:31.489
-I don't wanna hear it, J.D.
-You don't understand--

00:31.573 --> 00:33.491
As of this moment,
pending an investigation,

00:33.575 --> 00:34.909
you're assigned to the motor pool.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.704
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:37.787 --> 00:41.791
We have two officers down,
one DOA, the other critical.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.710
You people wouldn't transfer him!

00:43.793 --> 00:46.963
You-- You put his application
in a drawer, and--

00:47.047 --> 00:50.550
-Mrs. Halloran, I'm terribly--
-Don't be sorry!

00:50.633 --> 00:53.094
Someone used that gun
to kill a police officer.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.012
We're trying to find out who.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.346
Go check your records.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.807
The cops took the gun as evidence.
You guys got it.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.726
This is the seventh time in four years

00:59.809 --> 01:02.604
I've had to tell the wife
of one of my cops he's been killed.

01:02.687 --> 01:05.440
And you're not troubled by the fact that
we'll be setting free, within three years,

01:05.523 --> 01:08.276
a man who down the road may sell guns
to a dozen more killers?

01:10.653 --> 01:13.114
(chattering)

01:15.700 --> 01:16.534
PHIL: Item 12.

01:16.618 --> 01:19.746
Be reminded that subsequent
to the morning briefing,

01:19.829 --> 01:24.042
nearly a dozen reps from, uh,
various domestic armament firms

01:24.125 --> 01:26.044
will be convening in these chambers

01:27.253 --> 01:31.007
for the Third Annual Tactical Arms
and Firepower Exhibit,

01:31.091 --> 01:34.302
which is open to all
sworn personnel of Hill Street,

01:34.803 --> 01:36.721
Washington Heights and Fillmore precincts.

01:37.472 --> 01:41.976
Now, those officers wishing
to update themselves in advances

01:42.143 --> 01:47.107
on "optimum security hardware
and techniques"

01:48.024 --> 01:52.362
are hereby authorized one half-hour
duty allocation for said convention.

01:52.654 --> 01:56.324
You know, it might bode well for us
to take a look, fellas.

01:56.407 --> 02:02.288
Uh, what's available to us today,
the competition has tomorrow.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.334
Which brings me to Item 13,

02:06.417 --> 02:09.129
that shooters' alley off Tupper
near the Wonder Bar.

02:09.587 --> 02:11.714
According to local storekeepers,

02:12.715 --> 02:15.677
it's starting to look like
downtown Calcutta over there.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.679
(laughter)

02:17.762 --> 02:21.224
So, what do you say we make a few
highly visible, hypodermic runs

02:21.307 --> 02:22.892
through the gauntlet today, huh?

02:23.893 --> 02:27.021
All right, fellas.
Now, pay special attention to Item 14.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.320
Item 14 concerns, uh,

02:34.779 --> 02:39.742
the assembly of lures for deepwater bass

02:39.951 --> 02:42.203
using flaming orange,

02:42.912 --> 02:45.206
plastic night crawler,

02:45.707 --> 02:49.419
silver beads, and a number-four hook.

02:49.836 --> 02:50.670
Halloran?

02:56.634 --> 03:01.306
Or, in more general terms,
the long overdue burst of warm weather

03:01.389 --> 03:02.849
that has afflicted us all.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.393
Now, be reminded, in the springtime,

03:05.476 --> 03:10.648
a young felon's fancy turns to robbery,
rape, and aggravated assault.

03:11.649 --> 03:16.404
A sunny sky can put a purse snatcher
into a frenzy of creativity.

03:16.487 --> 03:20.450
Muggers, long imprisoned
by the severity of this past winter,

03:20.533 --> 03:22.994
are yearning to breathe free again.

03:23.578 --> 03:26.873
It behooves those of us
likely to be rendered less wary

03:26.956 --> 03:29.709
by said glorious weather
to keep an eye open.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.878
-I mean it.
-Which one, Sarge?

03:31.961 --> 03:34.923
(laughing)

03:35.882 --> 03:37.550
All right. That's it. Let's roll.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.553
And hey, hey, hey!

03:41.012 --> 03:42.805
Now, let's be careful out there.

03:47.894 --> 03:52.774
(indistinct conversations)

03:58.613 --> 04:01.157
Belker. Come on, move.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.326
Move!

04:11.459 --> 04:13.461
RENKO: I cannot help that.
I got to be here.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.797
Look, I got things happening
down here, too.

04:15.880 --> 04:16.756
You understand me?

04:17.507 --> 04:19.300
-RENKO: I do!
-Sit, hairball!

04:19.592 --> 04:21.427
So, big deal.
You're tired of hearing about it.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.638
If you'd left him
in the hospital like I said,

04:23.721 --> 04:25.598
there wouldn't be any problem,
would there?

04:26.140 --> 04:28.059
We could swing by your dad's over lunch.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.687
Great, that means he'll only be alone
18 hours today.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.815
-Well, have you thought about a nurse?
-$300 a day.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.484
Belker.

04:38.111 --> 04:38.987
Hi, Ma.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.574
Ma, you wanna settle down? Wha--

04:43.825 --> 04:45.952
Because you sound
a little hysterical to me.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.123
What do you mean,
there's a pervert in the house?

04:51.958 --> 04:54.502
Ma. Ma, Ma!

04:55.336 --> 04:57.922
Just because you found a dirty book
in his underwear drawer

04:58.006 --> 04:59.048
doesn't make him a pervert.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.216
(snickers)

05:00.717 --> 05:02.343
Do you wanna hold on a second, Ma?

05:04.137 --> 05:07.056
How would you like
an ear for breakfast, dirt bag?

05:10.310 --> 05:11.144
Ma?

05:11.978 --> 05:13.980
Ma, I'm gonna be very honest with you.

05:14.063 --> 05:16.190
You should be glad
he still shows some interest.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.192
MRS. BELKER (over phone):
<i>I want you to come and arrest your father.</i>

05:18.276 --> 05:20.528
I'm not gonna come down there
and arrest my own father.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.655
-MRS. BELKER (over phone):<i> Why not?</i>
-For two reasons.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.199
First of all, Ma,
he's protected by the Constitution.

05:25.283 --> 05:28.619
And second of all, I got a driver's test
in a couple of hours.

05:28.703 --> 05:29.954
MRS. BELKER (over phone):<i> Cancel it.</i>

05:30.204 --> 05:33.416
I can't, I've been waiting for this
appointment for over five weeks now.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.043
<i>-</i>MRS. BELKER (over phone):<i> Cancel it!</i>
-I can't cancel it.

05:35.126 --> 05:38.046
I'm driving on an expired driver's license
now for three years.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.505
It's getting very embarrassing.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.965
MRS. BELKER (over phone):
<i>Have you studied...</i>

05:41.049 --> 05:44.344
Yes, I studied for it. All this week, Ma.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.764
<i>-</i>MRS. BELKER (over phone):<i> Really?</i>
-Really. Really!

05:47.847 --> 05:50.141
<i>-</i>MRS. BELKER (over phone):<i> Really?</i>
-Really!

05:51.184 --> 05:55.271
<i>-</i>MRS. BELKER (over phone):<i> I love you.</i>
-I love you too, Ma. Goodbye.

05:58.024 --> 05:58.941
(whimpers)

06:01.486 --> 06:02.445
Name.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.698
Killy, Jean-Claude.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.784
(growls)

06:07.867 --> 06:10.620
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:10.703 --> 06:12.413
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:12.497 --> 06:16.209
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:16.292 --> 06:18.044
(sirens wailing)

06:23.508 --> 06:27.428
(theme music playing)

07:34.245 --> 07:38.458
I'm telling you, Henry, now that you're
on your way to becoming a single male,

07:38.541 --> 07:41.961
you have just got to rethink
your financial priorities.

07:42.462 --> 07:46.883
Only $3,500 down
will make you a full partner.

07:46.966 --> 07:47.800
What do you say, sport?

07:47.884 --> 07:51.971
Listen, we will work out
cohabitation arrangements later.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.306
Thank you, Howard,

07:53.681 --> 07:57.393
but an underground condo
doesn't exactly appeal to me,

07:57.477 --> 07:58.936
financially or otherwise.

07:59.145 --> 08:03.483
Henry, what are the two most
pressing problems of our time?

08:04.901 --> 08:07.361
Inflation, nuclear holocaust.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.406
Here's your hedge against both.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.450
Judas H., man!

08:12.533 --> 08:16.746
The Russians have seven warheads
designated for this population area alone.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.414
That may be so, Howard,

08:18.498 --> 08:21.417
but who in his right mind
would want to survive like that?

08:21.501 --> 08:23.169
PHIL: I second the motion, Howard.

08:23.711 --> 08:27.215
I'd rather be vaporized than live amongst
a decimated population

08:27.298 --> 08:29.592
of, uh, radioactive nomads.

08:29.675 --> 08:33.638
That is precisely the point
of First Strike Estates, Phil.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.389
It's survival with dignity.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.809
Take this activities room, for instance.

08:39.143 --> 08:44.649
It's buried half under a mountain.
We have 2,000 videotapes here.

08:45.149 --> 08:48.402
Ping-pong. Piped-in nature sounds.

08:48.486 --> 08:53.950
And enough foodstuffs to take us
to the goldarn tricentennial.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.619
I'd like to see some of that literature,
Lieutenant.

08:56.702 --> 08:57.620
Makes sense to me.

08:59.038 --> 09:02.208
Well, uh, Brunswick. Um--

09:03.042 --> 09:08.839
Well, you see, actually, uh,
the fact is that they're sold out.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.260
I mean, Henry here is just hoping
for a cancellation.

09:16.097 --> 09:21.185
"K-R-E-B-S-P"--

09:21.477 --> 09:23.729
Uh, you want
to try that again, Mr. Belker?

09:25.189 --> 09:26.065
Yes, ma'am.

09:28.276 --> 09:31.028
"K-R-E-B"--

09:31.237 --> 09:33.781
Mr. Belker, that's not any of the lines.

09:33.864 --> 09:35.283
Not even close.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.119
I'm going to have to mark you
for corrective lenses.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.121
What are you talking about, ma'am?

09:46.502 --> 09:48.296
You said the bottom line, right?

09:48.879 --> 09:53.718
"K-R-E-B-S P-U-B-L-I-S-H-I-N-G C-O,
period."

09:53.801 --> 09:55.386
Krebs Publishing Company.

10:00.474 --> 10:03.352
WOMAN: Uh, would you mind
taking your hat off, please, Mr. Belker?

10:06.689 --> 10:09.442
Okay, uh, now, smile, Mr. Belker.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.991
Come on, Mr. Belker.
Smile now so I could take the picture.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.163
Thank you, Mr. Belker.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.834
I can issue you a citation.

10:28.419 --> 10:31.172
-I can flunk you right now.
-Flunk me? For what?

10:32.131 --> 10:32.965
Look at this.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.301
You got no side-view mirror.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.888
You got no front license plate. Huh?

10:40.056 --> 10:41.474
Hmm? Look at this.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.102
Your back license plate's held on
by a coat hanger.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.562
You got a broken taillight.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.898
And look at this, huh? What is this?

10:48.981 --> 10:50.441
Look at this bumper.
It's about to fall off.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.693
Mr. Santos, you wanna take a look at this?

10:53.319 --> 10:56.989
I'm an undercover police officer.
I gotta have a vehicle like this.

10:58.532 --> 10:59.367
(sighs)

11:00.493 --> 11:03.120
Well, I suppose if you're a cop,
we can make one exception.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.875
-We'll use one of our vehicles.
-Thank you very much.

11:10.127 --> 11:11.837
Switch to the right lane, please.

11:12.838 --> 11:16.133
Gee, this is a nice vehicle.
Smells brand-new.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.969
It is brand-new.
Just came into the pool last week.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.971
Turn right, please.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.685
Look at that. Real smooth.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.145
Please, Mr. Belker. Enough conversation.

11:30.439 --> 11:31.816
Up here you'll parallel park.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.916
(man yelling in Spanish)

11:48.999 --> 11:51.585
(alarm blaring)

11:51.669 --> 11:57.299
(man continues yelling in Spanish)

11:57.383 --> 12:00.469
(tires screeching)

12:01.262 --> 12:03.597
Come on, hairball. That's a stickup!

13:04.742 --> 13:06.535
Police, armpit! Freeze!

13:06.744 --> 13:08.954
Get down there and suck dirt, dog breath!

13:09.163 --> 13:10.122
Move!

13:10.206 --> 13:13.918
(alarm blaring)

13:14.752 --> 13:17.505
Hey, you'll never guess who I saw
at Gabriel's Gate last night.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.173
That meat rack on Allen Street?

13:19.256 --> 13:22.009
Wait, let me guess.
J.D.'s off the wagon again.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.845
-Henry Goldblume.
-No.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.889
I mean, he looked like a college professor

13:26.972 --> 13:29.183
who took the wrong turn
going to the library.

13:29.683 --> 13:32.561
He was just standing
in the middle of the crowd, staring,

13:32.978 --> 13:35.314
with his hair all combed, new bow tie.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.900
Poor guy. Married all those years.

13:37.983 --> 13:38.901
He doesn't have a clue.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.820
I suppose you wanna give him the course

13:40.903 --> 13:44.990
in Contemporary Mediterranean
Lounge Lizardry, part one, huh?

13:45.658 --> 13:46.492
Hey!

13:47.701 --> 13:49.411
-COFFEY: That's real funny.
-(laughing)

13:51.747 --> 13:52.790
What's the matter?

13:53.999 --> 13:56.210
I saw something. Unattended unit.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.478
(chattering on radio)

14:24.613 --> 14:26.156
Looks like Halloran and Tubbs.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.285
This is Unit 2203.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.037
We've got an unattended unit here.
We're gonna check it out.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.708
(horn honks)

14:38.919 --> 14:39.753
Joe.

14:40.004 --> 14:40.838
MAN (over radio):<i> Yeah?</i>

14:41.171 --> 14:42.047
The door's open.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.967
(chattering on radio continues)

14:45.050 --> 14:46.093
Lock's broken.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.060
Jack! Wally!

15:19.919 --> 15:20.753
Joe.

15:28.385 --> 15:33.140
Economy, versatility,
penetration and firepower.

15:33.474 --> 15:37.478
The Armaco Bunker Buster,
37-millimeter tear gas grenade launcher,

15:37.770 --> 15:40.564
is, without a doubt,
the modern policeman's best defense

15:40.648 --> 15:42.483
against the urban uncertainties of today.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.654
At a weight of less than eight kilos,
the Bunker Buster supplies one man

15:46.737 --> 15:48.864
with the same relative field strength

15:48.948 --> 15:51.450
as a fully mobilized squad
of combat infantrymen.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.829
Its rapid fire, ease of operation,
and dependability

15:55.913 --> 15:59.166
make the Bunker Buster the most effective
instrument of crowd control

15:59.249 --> 16:00.876
ever developed in the free world.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.797
Budget some of these, Buck,
and I'll flush every geek fortress

16:04.880 --> 16:07.132
from here to the Avenue B overpass.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.969
For the price of any two of these, Howard,

16:10.511 --> 16:14.932
we could supply every man and woman
in the precinct with a bulletproof vest.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.602
You know, with the Teflon bullets
they're making these days,

16:18.686 --> 16:21.522
they cut through our flak jackets
like a knife through a meringue.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.565
MAN: Commander Remington.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.068
Alan Braverman.

16:26.443 --> 16:29.446
We talked about rapid tear gas deployment
last convention.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.990
-Ah.
-Alan Braverman.

16:31.782 --> 16:32.908
Covert Tech!

16:32.992 --> 16:34.493
Ah, of course. Covert Tech.

16:34.743 --> 16:35.786
(chuckles)

16:35.869 --> 16:37.621
Wait till you see
what I've got for you this year.

16:37.705 --> 16:44.169
We have a CN dispersal-type gas
10 times stronger than last year's gas.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.892
-Hello.
-Hi.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.603
-It's a bit numbing, isn't it?
-Hmm?

17:02.146 --> 17:06.817
All this-- calibers and muzzle velocity,
cyclic rates.

17:08.068 --> 17:09.028
To be honest...

17:10.487 --> 17:11.321
Captain...

17:11.739 --> 17:13.323
-Furillo.
-Furillo.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.035
I find it all very ostentatious.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.204
May I show you something?

17:21.206 --> 17:22.041
Sure.

17:23.709 --> 17:24.918
(gun cocking)

17:25.878 --> 17:26.837
Go ahead. Take it.

17:29.506 --> 17:30.466
It's beautiful, isn't it?

17:30.549 --> 17:31.467
(gun cocking)

17:31.967 --> 17:34.470
No pretension. Just craftsmanship.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.807
I see it as the standard issue
of the future.

17:39.975 --> 17:44.229
German-made, .380 auto,
eight-shot magazine,

17:45.731 --> 17:46.648
one in the chamber.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.150
Francis.

17:49.860 --> 17:50.694
Excuse me.

17:55.365 --> 17:56.200
Yeah, Phil?

17:56.742 --> 18:00.871
We have two officers down,
one DOA, the other critical.

18:01.622 --> 18:02.498
Who?

18:02.581 --> 18:04.792
Jack Halloran and Wallace Tubbs.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.376
Halloran's the fatality.

18:07.127 --> 18:10.047
They were shot inside
a stereo shop on Jefferson.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.378
Uh, the shooter was right there, Frank.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.589
They came in the back
as he was burglarizing the store.

18:53.006 --> 18:56.009
I guess they didn't check the office.
He was behind them.

18:56.844 --> 19:01.265
When they got over here,
he stepped out and fired five times.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.478
The ME says it was a large bore,
probably a .357.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.815
He was a back shooter, Frank.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.735
-What time did it happen?
-7:00, 7:30.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.155
Tubbs and Halloran
must have seen something in the alley,

19:16.238 --> 19:18.448
something that didn't look
particularly dangerous.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.200
Anyway, they didn't call it in.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.911
Did he take anything from the store?

19:22.995 --> 19:26.373
The owner says yes.
Radios, tape players and stuff.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.125
We're getting the list together now.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.337
Halloran was the one who was married?

19:33.338 --> 19:34.173
Yeah.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.602
(chattering on radios)

19:55.360 --> 19:56.278
Wally gonna make it?

19:57.321 --> 19:58.155
We don't know.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.867
I gotta get the unit down to Impound
for forensics.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.621
Looks like the shooter
took money off the victims,

20:05.746 --> 20:08.207
so they figure he probably
went through the unit, too.

20:11.627 --> 20:12.586
You want me along?

20:12.878 --> 20:16.006
No! I want you down here
knocking on doors.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.300
Check with delivery services,
garbage pickups,

20:18.383 --> 20:20.594
anybody who might have been in the alley
at the time of the shooting.

20:20.677 --> 20:22.804
-Talk to the bums who sleep here.
-Hey, Captain!

20:22.888 --> 20:25.933
Found this Colt Python .357
in a trash bin 100 yards back.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.726
There's still one unfired round in it.

20:31.063 --> 20:31.897
Find him.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.547
-Mrs. Halloran?
-Yes.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.925
I'm Captain Furillo from Hill Street.

21:00.425 --> 21:03.220
Is there someplace we could talk
for a few minutes?

21:04.805 --> 21:05.722
Uh--

21:19.361 --> 21:20.195
(door closes)

21:22.030 --> 21:23.323
-Mrs. Halloran--
-Is he alive?

21:23.740 --> 21:25.409
Just-- Just tell me that.

21:27.744 --> 21:31.540
Jack was shot and killed
sometime this morning in the line of duty.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.044
He and Wallace Tubbs
were investigating a break-in.

21:36.795 --> 21:39.172
Wallace was shot too. He's in surgery now.

21:40.215 --> 21:41.800
No arrests have been made yet.

21:43.719 --> 21:48.015
Jack was a fine officer
and a fine man, Mrs. Halloran.

21:49.224 --> 21:53.145
His-- His transfer was in.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.481
Three months ago it went in.

21:56.565 --> 21:59.776
He-- He was gonna transfer
off the Hill, and...

22:02.112 --> 22:03.822
then we were gonna have a baby.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.369
But you people wouldn't listen.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.747
You people wouldn't transfer him!

22:11.830 --> 22:15.208
You-- You put his application
in a drawer, and--

22:15.292 --> 22:19.212
-Mrs. Halloran, I'm terribly--
-Don't be sorry!

22:19.755 --> 22:23.550
Don't. (sobbing)

22:25.594 --> 22:31.641
(sobbing continues)

22:32.684 --> 22:33.894
Get out of here!

22:35.437 --> 22:37.022
Get a man over to Silva Sanitation.

22:37.105 --> 22:39.566
They make a collection down that alley
Tuesdays and Thursdays,

22:39.649 --> 22:41.943
usually at 4:00 a.m.,
but they may have been late this time.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.528
What about the Transit Authority?

22:43.904 --> 22:46.948
Get a man over to the Jefferson Bus Barn
to pick up trip sheets.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.117
Same with Top Hat Taxi.
Same with Yellow Dog Taxi.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.078
If anybody saw anything,
we want to talk to him.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.622
Oh, make sure everybody checks
with their snitches.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.416
And light a fire under
that store owner Jacobs.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.293
In the first place,
we don't want him concocting anything

22:58.377 --> 22:59.461
for tax or insurance purposes.

22:59.544 --> 23:02.005
And in the second place,
how long does an inventory take?

23:02.089 --> 23:03.965
We watched him through the whole count.

23:04.049 --> 23:07.302
Eight ghetto blasters missing
and three cases of auto cassette decks.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.304
We have notified all pawnshops,

23:09.388 --> 23:11.473
and I got Perez and Ellis
at the bus company,

23:11.556 --> 23:13.392
Coley and Lyle to the cab garages,

23:13.475 --> 23:15.811
and Hill, Renko, Coffey, Bates
on the shop people.

23:16.311 --> 23:17.312
Any word on Tubbs?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.272
He's still in surgery.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.858
Uh, Francis, preliminary forensics.

23:21.942 --> 23:25.112
No obvious unaccountable prints
on the door or windows.

23:25.529 --> 23:26.530
Possible dirt print.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.990
Nine-and-a-half work shoe,
just outside the rear door.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.368
But they suspect the guy
was wearing gloves.

23:31.743 --> 23:32.577
HENRY: Frank?

23:32.953 --> 23:35.330
Ballistics just matched
the bullets to the .357.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.416
Well, who's it registered to?
Where's the name?

23:37.499 --> 23:40.252
Joseph P. Alessi.
Doing business as Ace High Liquors.

23:40.335 --> 23:42.671
-A sole-proprietor business permit.
-All right. Get over there.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.965
As soon as Tubbs is able to talk,
I want a man over there too.

23:45.048 --> 23:47.217
-All right.
-Francis, Chief Daniels on four.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.427
He's called five times.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.887
Wanting to know why we're dragging
our feet, no doubt.

23:51.888 --> 23:52.973
MANUEL: Tomorrow, right?

23:53.056 --> 23:54.516
Tomorrow I'm gonna get some bail, right?

23:54.599 --> 23:55.684
Don't count on it, Manuel.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.769
This is your third robbery arrest
in a year!

23:57.853 --> 23:59.312
The judge isn't going to let you out!

23:59.396 --> 24:01.648
Hey, look, you gotta
do something for me, you know?

24:01.731 --> 24:02.816
You have to believe me!

24:02.899 --> 24:04.443
My son is a good boy.
He never hurt anybody!

24:04.526 --> 24:06.528
I'm sorry.
I don't think you belong in here.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.363
-I can tell that you think he did it.
-Ma'am?

24:08.447 --> 24:09.990
You people are all alike!

24:10.073 --> 24:14.202
-Ma'am, this is a restricted area.
-(shouting in Spanish)

24:14.286 --> 24:16.663
You gotta get me a lawyer, man, you know?
She's nothing, man!

24:16.746 --> 24:18.540
(Manuel shouting in Spanish)

24:18.623 --> 24:21.168
(shouting in Spanish) You know?

24:21.251 --> 24:24.296
You gotta get me some bail, Ma!
(shouting Spanish)

24:24.671 --> 24:29.092
Of course I won't issue a statement.
Nothing without your approval.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.512
Yeah, she's been told.

24:32.596 --> 24:34.097
-DANIELS (over phone):<i> Kids?</i>
-No. No children.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.098
DANIELS (over phone):
<i>All right, I want to hear any word.</i>

24:35.182 --> 24:36.766
Right. I'll get back to you, Chief.

24:37.267 --> 24:39.519
As soon as I know something,
you'll know something!

24:40.937 --> 24:42.022
(dial tone hums)

24:42.606 --> 24:43.565
(slams receiver down)

24:44.441 --> 24:47.402
JOYCE: Some morning. I'm sorry.

24:47.944 --> 24:48.778
No, it's--

24:50.322 --> 24:51.615
What can I do for you, Joyce?

24:52.157 --> 24:54.242
I'm up here on heroic assignment,

24:54.326 --> 24:57.120
defending a sensitive,
misunderstood young Hispanic

24:57.204 --> 24:59.915
who robs people by sticking
an umbrella in their back.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.918
I suppose we should be grateful
he doesn't run them through.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.507
You probably don't want to hear
about this now, but...

25:09.174 --> 25:11.134
I picked up the plane tickets
this morning.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.887
Uh, I think we're both
gonna need this vacation.

25:13.970 --> 25:16.515
Just say the word, big guy.
We could both quit.

25:16.848 --> 25:19.768
Go down to Saint Croix
and open up a real Italian pizza parlor.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.187
-No, a bait shop.
-(Joyce laughs)

25:22.270 --> 25:24.606
A bait shop, you don't have to learn
how to throw that dough in the air.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.858
(both laughing)

25:26.942 --> 25:29.528
Oh, all right. A bait shop.

25:31.279 --> 25:32.405
You want to get together later?

25:32.864 --> 25:35.200
Uh-- Yeah, let's see what happens here.

25:36.284 --> 25:37.202
(Frank sighs)

25:37.536 --> 25:38.370
I'll be home,

25:40.121 --> 25:41.122
as late as you want.

25:44.876 --> 25:48.380
By the way, I worked with
Jack Halloran a few times.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.800
I thought he was a real good guy.

25:52.342 --> 25:53.176
He was.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.154
-Can I help you?
-NEAL: We're police officers, ma'am.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.906
We'd like to speak with
the owner, Mr. Alessi.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.117
That's my husband.
He's been dead a year and a half.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.745
HENRY: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
But if you could help us, please.

26:21.288 --> 26:25.250
Mr. Alessi owned a gun,
a Colt Python .357.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.585
(door bells jingle)

26:26.876 --> 26:27.711
So what about it?

26:28.378 --> 26:30.589
Someone used that gun
to kill a police officer.

26:30.672 --> 26:31.881
We're trying to find out who.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.384
We were hoping you might know
what happened to the gun

26:34.467 --> 26:35.760
after your husband owned it.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.888
Happened to it? It got my husband killed,
That's what happened to it.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.391
-Ma'am?
-The robbery.

26:41.558 --> 26:45.562
My husband was killed in a robbery,
October 14, 1980.

26:45.979 --> 26:48.315
Go check your records.
The cops took the gun as evidence.

26:48.398 --> 26:49.649
You guys got it.

26:50.734 --> 26:53.862
You know, if my husband
hadn't pulled out that gun,

26:55.113 --> 26:56.364
they wouldn't have shot him.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.450
Ma'am, if you remember,

26:58.533 --> 27:00.452
the name of the man who shot your husband.

27:00.535 --> 27:02.787
What do I want to remember his name for?

27:03.371 --> 27:05.332
I mean, I've been robbed
three times since then.

27:05.415 --> 27:06.625
I just give 'em the money.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.627
I'll tell you something--

27:10.003 --> 27:11.921
I thought you guys were gonna rob me.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.343
(siren blaring)

27:16.426 --> 27:17.969
Let's try the south side
of Bryant Street again.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.304
Somebody must have seen something.

27:19.387 --> 27:21.348
I thought you wanted
to check with your father.

27:21.431 --> 27:22.724
Ah, damn. I forgot.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.100
Listen, I'm gonna have to keep working.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.186
I'll swing by and see him
after we're done.

27:26.269 --> 27:29.481
Hey, cowboy, how are you and him
getting along anyway?

27:29.564 --> 27:30.398
Okay, I guess.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.608
Between all the cooking and the cleaning,

27:31.691 --> 27:34.319
I've seen more of him in the last month
than I have in the last 10 years.

27:34.402 --> 27:36.237
Oh, that's good. I'm glad to hear that.

27:38.531 --> 27:41.493
I hate him, Bobby.
He don't care about nothing or nobody.

27:41.576 --> 27:42.869
Don't even care enough to try.

27:42.952 --> 27:44.663
I've hated him ever since I was a kid.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.499
And now he's gonna die on me before
I have a chance to do anything about it.

27:47.582 --> 27:51.920
DISPATCHER:<i> Any units in the vicinity,</i>
<i>see man with gun at 416 Wilcox.</i>

27:52.003 --> 27:54.631
<i>Repeat-- man with gun, 416 Wilcox.</i>

27:54.714 --> 27:56.883
Unit 2202 responding. Let's hit it.

27:56.966 --> 27:57.801
(engine revving)

27:57.884 --> 27:59.427
(tires screeching)

27:59.511 --> 28:00.720
-MAN: Get out of here!
-MAN 2: The hell I will!

28:00.804 --> 28:02.389
MAN: I said, stop it!

28:02.472 --> 28:04.349
MAN 2: I ain't going!
Give me another drink!

28:04.432 --> 28:06.142
-MAN: You've had enough to drink, old man.
-I want a drink!

28:06.226 --> 28:08.770
I spend my money in this place! (shouting)

28:08.853 --> 28:10.063
Freeze! Gun!

28:10.146 --> 28:11.314
No, Renko!

28:12.649 --> 28:13.650
Geez!

28:22.701 --> 28:24.452
You said "man with a gun."
Where's the gun?

28:25.078 --> 28:25.912
Lousy drunk.

28:26.413 --> 28:28.123
Tried to cut him off,
but he wouldn't leave.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.040
Almost jumped the bar.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.458
He's clean.

28:31.459 --> 28:32.711
Where's the gun, man?

28:32.794 --> 28:34.546
Get your hands off me.
I never said anything about no gun.

28:34.629 --> 28:35.505
MAN 2: The man's lying.

28:35.588 --> 28:37.424
-They all heard him make the call.
-RENKO: Shut up!

28:38.800 --> 28:40.176
Had a brawl in here last month.

28:40.260 --> 28:42.512
Took you cops 45 minutes to get here.
Forty-five!

28:42.929 --> 28:45.432
-At least you're here, aren't you?
-You lousy piece of--

28:49.394 --> 28:50.979
HILL: Renko! Renko!

28:52.439 --> 28:55.775
Renko! What are you doing?
Stop! What are you doing?

28:58.737 --> 28:59.946
Let go of me. Let go of me.

29:11.416 --> 29:14.502
And you, get out of here
and find someplace else to get drunk.

29:17.630 --> 29:21.593
You do that again,
and I'm not gonna take him off your butt!

29:22.969 --> 29:24.471
(bat clattering on floor)

29:36.941 --> 29:38.318
Let's get another car
down there in the alley,

29:38.401 --> 29:39.235
make sure we haven't missed anything.

29:39.319 --> 29:40.528
Frank, I gotta talk to you.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.405
Can it wait, Fay? I'm up to my ears.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.823
No, it cannot.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.951
Frank, I may be in serious trouble
with the police.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.787
There may be a warrant out for my arrest.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.538
What did you do this time?

29:50.622 --> 29:53.249
Nothing.
But don't tell that to Florine Kaplan.

29:53.333 --> 29:56.503
She's threatening to charge me
with corrupting the morals of a minor.

29:56.586 --> 29:57.629
Statutory rape.

29:57.712 --> 29:59.964
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Who's Florine Kaplan?

30:00.340 --> 30:01.883
She's Joanna Kaplan's mother--

30:01.966 --> 30:05.178
a little girl in Frank Jr.'s class
that he plays with sometimes.

30:05.386 --> 30:09.265
Oh, God. It's all my fault.
How could I be so stupid?

30:10.016 --> 30:12.060
He invited her over to play today,

30:12.143 --> 30:13.645
and when her mother came to pick her up,

30:13.728 --> 30:16.481
we went to Frank Jr.'s bedroom
where I had left them alone.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.193
They were playing doctor, Frank.

30:20.735 --> 30:23.238
Every kid in the world plays doctor.
What's she so upset about?

30:23.738 --> 30:26.449
They were naked, Frank. Stark naked.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.993
With a look of great discovery
on their faces.

30:30.453 --> 30:32.956
-How can you laugh?
-Well, it's funny.

30:33.581 --> 30:35.625
And right now I could use a good laugh.

30:36.251 --> 30:39.546
Frank, she's threatening
to have me arrested.

30:40.129 --> 30:43.049
I don't think I could stand
spending any more time in prison.

30:43.132 --> 30:44.467
I'm very vulnerable right now.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.720
She's not gonna have you arrested.
She's just upset.

30:48.429 --> 30:50.390
-Can she sue me?
-For what?

30:50.640 --> 30:52.392
A couple of kids with normal curiosity?

30:52.475 --> 30:56.437
Oh, Frank, you don't understand.
She went crazy.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.315
She accused me of raising
a depraved child,

30:59.566 --> 31:03.069
of inflicting psychological damage
on her daughter.

31:03.152 --> 31:05.488
Fay, you've raised
a perfectly normal child.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.865
(Fay sighs)

31:08.575 --> 31:10.285
Well, we both have.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.540
Don't worry. She'll calm down.

31:16.541 --> 31:17.750
Lord, I hope so.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.210
Excuse me, Francis. Hello, Fay.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.296
Wallins from the property department
is here.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.798
He's brought the records
on that .357 that killed Halloran.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.758
-He's in Interrogation.
-Thanks, Phil.

31:28.177 --> 31:29.095
Jack Halloran?

31:30.179 --> 31:32.640
Oh, Phil. I didn't know.

31:32.932 --> 31:34.017
Early this morning.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.066
HUNTER: Fay, Fay.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.862
Have you thought about the future
of young Frank Jr. lately,

31:45.945 --> 31:47.447
vis-à-vis the unthinkable?

31:48.156 --> 31:50.992
-Howard?
-First Strike Estates, Fay.

31:53.995 --> 31:56.873
When the big blast hits,
are you just gonna go up in ash?

31:57.457 --> 32:01.085
Well, here it is. Pink sheet 199436.

32:01.628 --> 32:04.547
A .357 confiscated as evidence
in a liquor store robbery

32:04.631 --> 32:07.300
and transferred to the property department
for disposal.

32:08.217 --> 32:11.095
I sent it to the Westgate
wrecking facility on December 12,

32:11.179 --> 32:13.014
just like I told you guys over the phone.

32:13.473 --> 32:16.476
It never got there, Wallins.
We checked with Westgate.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.980
(chuckles) You're giving more credence
to their records than to mine?

32:21.064 --> 32:22.190
I mean, come on. They're a--

32:22.273 --> 32:24.817
A lousy civilian salvage yard. (chuckles)

32:24.901 --> 32:27.487
Those "civilians" sent you three letters
last January

32:27.570 --> 32:30.239
apprising you
of the inventory discrepancy.

32:31.282 --> 32:34.327
Look, fellas, I-- I ship nearly 50 pieces
out of that place a day.

32:34.410 --> 32:38.206
Over 250 pieces a week,
from 14 different precincts--

32:38.289 --> 32:40.792
I mean, .22s, .38s, .45s,
nine millimeters.

32:40.875 --> 32:43.920
I mean, you name it-- everything from, uh,
peashooters to grenade launchers.

32:44.003 --> 32:46.756
I mean, how in the hell am I supposed
to know what happened to it?

32:50.301 --> 32:52.136
Come on, fellas.
Give me a break, will ya? I mean...

32:52.679 --> 32:54.597
Stuff gets stolen out of there
all the time.

32:55.765 --> 32:56.599
We know.

32:57.475 --> 32:58.309
Oh, I see.

32:59.268 --> 33:01.479
I see. I get it.
You think I ripped it off, right?

33:02.772 --> 33:04.482
Well, there are two other guys
in the property department

33:04.565 --> 33:05.608
who do the same job as me.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.944
-How come you ain't asking them questions?
-FRANK: Mm-mm.

33:08.236 --> 33:12.532
Weapon number 199436
went through your hands.

33:14.409 --> 33:15.243
Hey, come on.

33:15.326 --> 33:17.245
What's so important
about this piece, anyhow?

33:17.328 --> 33:19.122
FRANK: You heard about
the cop-killing this morning?

33:19.747 --> 33:22.917
This supposedly demolished .357 did it.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.338
HENRY: So, big deal
if you skimmed a gun off the heap.

33:28.381 --> 33:32.135
We're not looking to burn you, Wallins,
but we will if we have to.

33:34.137 --> 33:36.389
You're just four months
short of your 20 years, aren't you?

33:36.848 --> 33:39.684
You really wanna throw 19 years
down the drain, man?

33:40.059 --> 33:44.939
No pension, no medical, retirement--
all shot to hell.

33:48.317 --> 33:49.152
Seem--

33:49.986 --> 33:51.696
Seemed like such a waste at the time--

33:53.281 --> 33:55.533
putting a $600 piece into the grinder.

33:59.078 --> 34:00.997
I gave it to my brother-in-law
for Christmas.

34:04.417 --> 34:06.961
JAWORSKI: No, no, no.
He didn't give me the .357.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.505
-He sold it to me for 200 clams.
-HENRY: Mm-hmm.

34:09.589 --> 34:13.551
I only had the darn piece about two weeks
before the house was robbed.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.262
Those slimebags nearly got
my entire collection.

34:16.721 --> 34:20.016
Cost me three grand over the
insurance money to have it all replaced.

34:20.099 --> 34:22.518
And that's not counting
the Webley Mark IV.

34:22.935 --> 34:26.314
They broke in through that window
while the wife and I were at her sister's.

34:26.731 --> 34:27.774
Good gun, the Python.

34:28.232 --> 34:29.901
How long ago was that, Mr. Jaworski?

34:30.276 --> 34:33.488
I don't know, a couple of weeks
after my brother-in-law brought it over.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.823
January 14 or 15, I think.

34:37.325 --> 34:40.328
Say, this officer, he-- he have a family?

34:41.662 --> 34:43.623
-Wife.
-(Jaworski sighs)

34:43.706 --> 34:46.667
What a world, huh? Makes you wonder--
whatever happened to morality?

34:46.751 --> 34:49.045
Have you got a burglary report
you can show us?

34:49.712 --> 34:50.546
We--

34:50.713 --> 34:54.967
Well, not really.
I mean, uh, I don't even think I kept it.

34:55.051 --> 34:58.096
(chuckles) Look, Mr. Jaworski,
we're not here to cause you any trouble,

34:58.179 --> 34:59.972
but we gotta verify all this.

35:00.056 --> 35:02.058
JAWORSKI: Yeah, well, that's the problem.

35:02.141 --> 35:04.727
You see, seeing that I didn't have
the registration

35:04.811 --> 35:08.356
and so as not to get my brother-in-law
in any kind of trouble,

35:09.607 --> 35:11.359
I didn't report the .357.

35:12.860 --> 35:13.945
Hey, fellas. Come on, now.

35:14.028 --> 35:17.657
I'm really sorry about that--
that cop of yours, but it's not my fault.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.325
I am just a collector.

35:19.951 --> 35:23.162
Were there any other weapons stolen
you thought it best not to report?

35:23.788 --> 35:27.208
Uh, no. Uh, um, nothing worth mentioning.

35:28.876 --> 35:32.296
Well, actually there was
this Uzi submachine gun

35:32.380 --> 35:34.132
my cousin picked up in Miami.

35:38.886 --> 35:39.720
(clears throat)

35:43.391 --> 35:45.226
I swear to God, Frank,
this gun's been around town

35:45.309 --> 35:47.228
more than some social diseases.

35:47.311 --> 35:50.356
The liquor store owner,
the property clerk, his brother-in-law.

35:50.439 --> 35:52.275
Now we find out this Jaworski character

35:52.358 --> 35:55.403
had the .357 stolen out of his home
last January,

35:55.611 --> 35:57.446
and he never put it
on the burglary report.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.157
I don't suppose we've
nailed anybody on this one.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.367
HENRY: It's been in the dead file
since last month.

36:01.450 --> 36:04.287
Neal's running down the numbers
of the other stolen pieces now.

36:04.370 --> 36:06.831
One of 'em's an Uzi submachine gun, Frank.

36:06.914 --> 36:09.375
A conspicuous piece like that could put us
right back on the track.

36:09.458 --> 36:10.835
Think we might have something.

36:10.918 --> 36:13.254
Black market gun dealer
by the name of Anthony Barto.

36:13.337 --> 36:15.423
Busted last month
for selling to an undercover.

36:15.756 --> 36:17.175
Part of the haul was the Uzi.

36:17.925 --> 36:20.386
-Okay. Pick him up.
-NEAL: We already got him, Captain.

36:20.469 --> 36:21.679
He's in county lockup.

36:23.222 --> 36:26.309
Ray, get me the ADA,
I don't care what he's doing.

36:26.392 --> 36:29.061
-I want him down at County in 15 minutes.
-All right, Frank.

36:34.317 --> 36:38.446
Pepi, try to raise Renko for me.
It's about his father, huh?

36:40.489 --> 36:44.160
WOMAN (on P.A.):
<i>Dr. Collins, ICU, third floor, stat.</i>

36:44.410 --> 36:45.536
<i>Dr. Collins.</i>

36:55.171 --> 36:56.005
What happened?

36:56.881 --> 36:58.633
I went over to the house at one o'clock.

36:59.592 --> 37:01.302
He was paralyzed from the chest down.

37:01.886 --> 37:04.597
-His spine collapsed.
-Is there anything you can do about it?

37:05.348 --> 37:06.599
He's gonna die, Mr. Renko.

37:07.642 --> 37:10.019
Maybe tonight or tomorrow,
the next day at the latest.

37:11.812 --> 37:12.647
Can I talk to him?

37:13.314 --> 37:14.148
Sure.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.567
Just don't expect very much.
He's heavily sedated.

37:21.572 --> 37:24.951
I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee, okay?
I'll be back in a few minutes.

37:25.576 --> 37:26.410
Where's Tommy?

37:27.870 --> 37:30.831
I've been trying him all afternoon.
I'll try him again.

37:32.708 --> 37:35.002
-Andy, look--
-Just go get a cup of coffee.

37:49.684 --> 37:52.478
-(labored breathing)
-(Renko sobbing)

38:07.201 --> 38:10.955
(siren blaring)

38:11.956 --> 38:13.833
(chattering)

38:13.916 --> 38:15.710
MAN: About three weeks.

38:20.339 --> 38:23.467
You bought an Uzi nine-millimeter
automatic rifle,

38:24.093 --> 38:27.888
serial number 932846B,

38:28.389 --> 38:29.432
as in "Baker."

38:30.558 --> 38:32.852
We're interested in knowing
from whom you made the purchase.

38:34.353 --> 38:37.231
Gentlemen, that information
doesn't come without a price tag.

38:37.815 --> 38:40.276
We're prepared to make
some kind of an agreement.

38:40.901 --> 38:41.902
What are you offering?

38:42.862 --> 38:45.239
A kick down of all counts to "D" felonies.

38:46.115 --> 38:49.452
Lose one of the sales
and all of the possessions except one.

38:51.620 --> 38:54.415
Stick it. You gotta do better than that.

38:54.915 --> 38:57.501
Mr. Barto, you're currently awaiting trial

38:57.585 --> 38:59.837
on two counts
of unlawful sale of a firearm

38:59.920 --> 39:02.256
and 32 counts of unlawful possession.

39:02.506 --> 39:05.593
You have, if memory serves me,
two prior felony convictions.

39:06.302 --> 39:08.846
Now, it doesn't seem to me that you're
in any position to bargain at this point.

39:08.929 --> 39:12.141
When I tried to deal this a couple
of weeks ago, you guys give me squat.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.894
(chuckles) Now, all of a sudden,
you're climbing the walls.

39:15.519 --> 39:17.897
We're not "climbing the walls,"
as you say, Mr. Barto.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.648
We've simply reevaluated our position.

39:19.732 --> 39:21.233
Could we cut through the manure?

39:24.153 --> 39:25.863
You'd love to get away with a misdemeanor,

39:25.946 --> 39:29.784
but you'd settle for a bargain basement
"E" felony in a pinch, wouldn't you?

39:30.951 --> 39:32.953
You don't want to give him
a bargain basement "E,"

39:33.037 --> 39:36.082
but as long as it's not cut down
to a misdemeanor, you won't look too bad,

39:36.165 --> 39:38.376
and we're the ones after the information,
aren't we?

39:39.794 --> 39:42.213
But I wouldn't be so smug
if I were you, Barto.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.257
With your priors, if you don't deal now,

39:45.341 --> 39:47.259
and we have to get
the information elsewhere,

39:47.343 --> 39:49.261
you're gonna be leaving prison
in a walker.

39:50.805 --> 39:53.224
Two days or two weeks from now,
you'd have to get to this anyway,

39:53.307 --> 39:54.308
and I don't have the time.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.312
LAWYER: Does he speak for you?

39:59.522 --> 40:01.857
-I'll see what I can do.
-LAWYER: That's not good enough.

40:02.441 --> 40:03.275
I'll recommend it.

40:03.651 --> 40:04.485
Promise it.

40:06.278 --> 40:07.113
Okay.

40:08.447 --> 40:12.159
You understand, I-I-I got a street name
or something, maybe.

40:12.993 --> 40:13.828
What is it?

40:15.871 --> 40:16.705
(sighs)

40:17.289 --> 40:19.834
William Harris. Billy.

40:21.335 --> 40:24.922
Bill Harris, he's a burglar.
He's got a lot of hot guns.

40:30.344 --> 40:32.721
Frank! Thanks a hell of a lot.

40:32.805 --> 40:35.141
You really cut me off at the knees
in there, you know that?

40:35.224 --> 40:38.310
Marv, I have one man dead
and another man shot,

40:38.394 --> 40:40.646
and all I have to go on
is a trail of weaponry.

40:41.105 --> 40:43.274
If we keep jerking around here,
we're gonna get lost.

40:43.357 --> 40:45.067
Barto's the only one
who can keep us moving.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.987
And you're not troubled by the fact that
we'll be setting free, within three years,

40:48.070 --> 40:50.739
a man who down the road may sell guns
to a dozen more killers?

40:50.823 --> 40:54.452
They can always get guns, Marv.
The world's full of guns.

40:58.539 --> 41:01.417
Chief, it's not my fault
the central computer's down.

41:01.500 --> 41:05.171
Nor is it my fault that Division's
manual files are two years out of date.

41:05.254 --> 41:07.214
Please. Please!
Just have a little patience.

41:07.298 --> 41:08.966
HENRY: Whoa, wait. Don't put me on hold!

41:09.049 --> 41:11.385
Francis, it's gonna be three hours.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.012
(sighs) Do what you can, Phil.

41:13.095 --> 41:14.346
HENRY: You're the first person
I've talked to.

41:14.430 --> 41:15.431
Our computer's down.

41:15.514 --> 41:18.184
We just want to plug into the FBI's
for a couple of hours.

41:18.267 --> 41:19.393
Hey, listen, Rolly-boy.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.854
You get out on the street
and find me this Billy Harris.

41:21.937 --> 41:24.023
Your nose is gonna feel
real sweet tonight, babe.

41:24.440 --> 41:27.485
Yeah, I know it's a clumsy misuse
of federal program time,

41:27.568 --> 41:28.944
but our computer's down!

41:34.200 --> 41:35.159
Here's a guy--

41:35.701 --> 41:39.997
William T. Harris.
GTA, assault, burglary.

41:42.208 --> 41:43.751
He's been upstate three years.

41:48.923 --> 41:49.757
Mike.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.759
This is some of Halloran
and Tubbs's stuff.

41:51.842 --> 41:53.177
I got it out of the back of their unit.

41:53.260 --> 41:54.261
NEAL: J.D.!

41:54.595 --> 41:55.429
Hey, Neal.

41:57.014 --> 41:59.475
-How's your investigation coming?
-(sighs)

41:59.934 --> 42:02.186
Did you ever know a guy on the street
by the name of Billy Harris?

42:02.645 --> 42:05.231
-Knew a William Harris.
-5'8", thin, white dude. Light brown hair?

42:05.314 --> 42:08.150
No, no, this guy was Black.
What about this Billy Harris?

42:09.068 --> 42:11.195
Well, in March he sold an Uzi to a dude.

42:12.029 --> 42:14.657
Back in January, that same Uzi
got ripped off from a collector

42:14.740 --> 42:16.784
along with the .357 that shot Halloran.

42:17.409 --> 42:20.704
So, could be he was just some middle guy
who never saw the .357.

42:20.788 --> 42:24.291
Could be he had the .357
and sold it to some other dude.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.001
-Or could be--
-Wait-- Wait a minute.

42:26.210 --> 42:28.462
What about Billy Harrison?
Squirrel Harrison.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.297
-Who?
-Mean little dude. Burglar.

42:30.381 --> 42:32.007
Used to deal speed and acid
in the Heights.

42:32.091 --> 42:34.009
He ran with a snitch of mine,
Sammy Liddle.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.720
You know, he kind of fits
your description.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.055
William Harrison.

42:40.140 --> 42:42.518
A.K.A. the Squirrel, A.K.A. William Hart,

42:42.601 --> 42:45.604
A.K.A. Billy Williamson,
A.K.A. William Harris.

42:45.688 --> 42:49.692
Last address, May '73,
Glen Oaks Drug-Free Rehabilitation.

42:50.109 --> 42:52.069
Maybe when the computer's back,
we'll get something newer.

42:52.152 --> 42:54.029
Come on, lover.
Wanna go find Sammy Liddle?

42:59.243 --> 43:00.953
-Sammy!
-J.D.

43:01.036 --> 43:04.039
Hey, uh, long time no see.
What are you doing?

43:04.123 --> 43:05.749
Your old lady told me you were down here.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.835
Hey, she's really got you
domesticated, huh?

43:08.419 --> 43:11.839
Yeah, I'm the regular Paul Newman
of the fluff-and-fold set.

43:11.922 --> 43:15.259
So, uh-- So, what's happenin'?
You just around or what?

43:15.426 --> 43:18.387
I, uh-- I need for us to do
a little business together, Sammy.

43:19.346 --> 43:20.180
What kind of business?

43:20.264 --> 43:22.057
Here, babe. Let me give you a hand, okay?

43:22.141 --> 43:25.019
Billy Harrison. Squirrel Harrison.
We need to find him.

43:25.102 --> 43:26.812
You tell us where he is,
you make a fast 50.

43:26.895 --> 43:28.897
It's your basic mutuality of interest.

43:29.356 --> 43:33.444
I don't do that no more, J.D.
You know I'd love to, but I can't.

43:33.527 --> 43:35.946
Hey. What's that mean, "can't"?

43:36.655 --> 43:40.451
Remember a guy named Marty Gleason,
arm twister for Jake Radnitz?

43:40.868 --> 43:43.287
Well, I rolled over on the guy
about six months ago.

43:43.704 --> 43:46.373
He copped, and he came out in three days.

43:47.833 --> 43:51.003
They took me in an alley, J.D.,
really worked me over.

43:51.086 --> 43:53.464
I spent a couple of weeks
in Intensive Care.

43:53.839 --> 43:56.216
So what it is is,
I-I can't snitch no more.

43:56.300 --> 43:58.093
It ain't no good for my health.

43:58.177 --> 44:00.512
The wife wants to know I'll be coming home
every day in one piece.

44:00.596 --> 44:02.765
No, no, no, no.
This wouldn't have to be like snitching.

44:02.848 --> 44:07.144
It's more like being a good citizen.
Hey, all we need's an address on the guy.

44:07.728 --> 44:08.771
You don't understand.

44:09.730 --> 44:12.024
Billy Harrison is worse
than Marty Gleason.

44:12.524 --> 44:13.859
And Gleason is crazy.

44:13.942 --> 44:16.362
He slammed me face-first
into a brick wall.

44:16.695 --> 44:18.781
Yeah? Hmm.

44:19.448 --> 44:21.659
-Did he put you in a dryer?
-Huh?

44:21.825 --> 44:23.911
He slammed you face-first
into a brick wall, Sammy,

44:23.994 --> 44:25.579
but did he put you in a dryer?

44:26.121 --> 44:26.955
No.

44:27.331 --> 44:30.334
Tell me where Squirrel Harrison is,
or I'm gonna put you in that dryer.

44:30.417 --> 44:32.211
Hey, come on, man. Quit kidding around.

44:32.294 --> 44:33.545
You-- You wouldn't do that.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.964
I got a pocketful of quarters.

44:36.048 --> 44:39.343
Now, the first cycle might not kill you,
but the second one--

44:39.426 --> 44:41.762
Your face is gonna wind up
two sizes smaller, my man.

44:41.845 --> 44:43.222
I'm not kidding, Sammy.

44:43.305 --> 44:45.099
-I'm gonna put you in there.
-Hey, hey! Come on, guys!

44:45.182 --> 44:47.559
-There's people all over the place.
-So what?

44:47.810 --> 44:50.437
Who cares about his fellow man anymore?
Huh?

44:50.521 --> 44:51.605
Hey! Hey!

44:52.189 --> 44:53.941
Just blow-drying his hair, ma'am.

44:54.024 --> 44:56.485
Now, talk to me Sammy, huh?
Come on. Squirrel Harrison.

44:56.568 --> 44:59.363
Okay, okay! I'll talk! Okay! Okay! Okay.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.033
You don't have to be
so hostile all the time.

45:03.951 --> 45:06.662
Last time I heard,
he was living over on 119th Street.

45:07.246 --> 45:08.706
Corner building, next to the deli.

45:09.206 --> 45:10.124
Attaboy.

45:11.834 --> 45:15.087
Sorry we had to get rough,
Sammy, but this one's kind of important.

45:16.922 --> 45:17.756
Let's go, man.

45:19.925 --> 45:22.511
Man, sometimes I don't know
where you get that stuff.

45:22.803 --> 45:24.972
I don't know, Neal. It just comes to me.

45:37.568 --> 45:40.070
NEAL: He's our man, Henry. Take a look.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.491
Stuff from the stereo shop.

45:48.120 --> 45:51.623
(thunder rumbling)

46:29.286 --> 46:30.996
HENRY (on bullhorn):
<i>Freeze it right there, Harrison.</i>

46:31.079 --> 46:32.331
<i>Hands away from your body.</i>

46:36.502 --> 46:41.465
(gunfire)

46:53.143 --> 46:54.853
This is the seventh time in four years

46:54.937 --> 46:57.898
I've had to tell the wife
of one of my cops he's been killed.

47:00.108 --> 47:03.403
It's guerrilla warfare out there.
They kill us, we kill them.

47:03.487 --> 47:05.322
You need a scorecard to tell the players.

47:08.075 --> 47:09.493
Every crazy's got a gun.

47:09.576 --> 47:12.996
(siren blaring)

47:13.080 --> 47:14.706
Not just the crazies, Frank.

47:17.501 --> 47:18.627
I've got one, too.

47:19.837 --> 47:20.671
Since when?

47:23.257 --> 47:26.844
Since Pam was murdered.
I keep it in my purse.

47:36.854 --> 47:39.773
Joyce, handguns are illegal in this state
without a carry permit.

47:40.274 --> 47:41.483
I've got a carry permit.

47:43.026 --> 47:46.321
I pulled a favor from Bob Hazeltine
in the D.A.'s office.

47:52.035 --> 47:52.870
FRANK: I don't like it.

47:52.953 --> 47:55.956
Neither do I, but I won't be helpless.

47:59.001 --> 48:00.919
-Joyce.
-Frank, please.

48:02.546 --> 48:03.380
Come to bed.

48:04.590 --> 48:05.924
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

48:07.801 --> 48:08.635
Please.

48:12.723 --> 48:13.557
(clears throat)

48:15.851 --> 48:19.521
(thunderclap)

48:39.875 --> 48:42.878
(closing theme playing)
