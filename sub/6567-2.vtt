Where do I start my search?

00:15.049 --> 00:16.350
The hanged man.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.653
The Jew that was hanged -
I want to unearth his body.

00:18.721 --> 00:23.092
My mistress insisted that
you be the one to capture her beauty.

<i>I sense the Vatican's</i>

00:26.596 --> 00:28.664
You need weapons of your own
Your Magnificence.

00:28.731 --> 00:32.000
This will greatly
increase your firepower.

00:32.067 --> 00:34.635

01:53.713 --> 01:57.449
He told me the river
was circular.

01:57.517 --> 02:00.419
That one man's death paves the
way for the birth of another.

02:00.487 --> 02:04.157
Indeed, and men

There is no yesterday,

02:59.851 --> 03:01.819
No tomorrow.

but enhance it.

03:25.644 --> 03:27.078
There.

03:29.382 --> 03:31.149
What is it?

03:31.217 --> 03:33.184
They don't like their
graves being violated,

03:33.252 --> 03:36.688
so they cover them in sand and
letters to alert them of mischief.

<i>What does it say?</i>

04:19.228 --> 04:22.431
- (Gasps)
- One corpse.

04:22.499 --> 04:25.668
Freshly plucked.

04:25.735 --> 04:28.504
Was it a nightmare, maestro?

04:28.571 --> 04:30.272
No, it was something
else entirely.

04:33.510 --> 04:35.945
Take notes, would you?

04:36.013 --> 04:40.885
I perceive the expected

<i>Circumcised member.</i>

<i>Leo, what are you doing?</i>

Specifically,
the seat of the soul.

- Oh...!

06:13.478 --> 06:15.379
<i>Did your husband</i>

It's a family heirloom.

From Ceylon.

06:24.555 --> 06:26.923
It's a stone called
Serendibite.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.598
What's troubling you?

06:35.666 --> 06:40.404
Count Riario is coming
to pay us a visit.

06:40.472 --> 06:42.272
For what purpose?

06:42.340 --> 06:44.542
Oh, nothing pleasant,
I'm sure.

06:46.478 --> 06:49.746
But I'll be expected
to wine and dine him,

06:49.814 --> 06:52.082
whilst hosting the rest
of Florence's elite.

06:53.918 --> 06:56.219
Will you come?

06:56.287 --> 06:59.256
You can keep Riario
entertained.

06:59.324 --> 07:01.225
Will Clarice be there?

07:01.292 --> 07:02.459
Of course.

07:05.197 --> 07:08.499
We can steal glances
throughout the evening.

07:08.567 --> 07:11.169
(Chuckles)

07:11.236 --> 07:14.005
I'll even invite that
scoundrel, if you like.

07:16.108 --> 07:18.710
Da Vinci.

07:18.778 --> 07:21.612
The one who's supposed to be
painting your portrait.

07:22.882 --> 07:26.217
And building me a weapon.

07:33.726 --> 07:36.161
<i>(Door closing)</i>

07:42.435 --> 07:44.236
You're late, son.

07:44.303 --> 07:46.772
Contract - signed.

07:48.708 --> 07:51.343
And now binding.

07:51.411 --> 07:53.712
- Did you not even read it?
- We'd agreed the terms.

07:53.780 --> 07:56.615
But not the administration
of those terms.

07:56.683 --> 07:58.884
I told you to stay away.

07:58.952 --> 08:01.220
I let you know there
would be consequences.

08:01.288 --> 08:03.456
What do you think
you've done?

08:03.524 --> 08:05.325
Painting Lucrezia Donati,

08:05.393 --> 08:10.497
fraudulently leading the Medicis to believe
you can deliver preposterous weapons.

08:10.565 --> 08:15.268
You've overreached, and now I've
made it so you'll soon be gone.

08:15.336 --> 08:19.773
There isn't a contract you can
devise that can contain me.

08:19.841 --> 08:23.544
You're the bastard son of a servant
girl I spilled my seed into.

08:23.611 --> 08:26.046
Your heritage contains you.

08:50.672 --> 08:52.306
(Sighs)

09:02.851 --> 09:04.819
(Groaning)

09:12.695 --> 09:15.397
(Shrieks) No!

09:15.465 --> 09:17.399
- What's wrong?
- What's changed?

09:18.935 --> 09:23.206
Something's shifted
in you since last we met.

09:23.274 --> 09:27.811
Perhaps it's just you and me
here in Lorenzo's home.

09:27.879 --> 09:29.380
Feeling guilty?

09:29.447 --> 09:32.783
It's not as if I don't have
affection for him.

09:32.851 --> 09:35.652
<i>Or perhaps...</i>

09:35.720 --> 09:39.123
..I'm guilty about
feeling guilty.

09:41.192 --> 09:43.460
It's not as if I don't have
affection for you as well.

09:43.528 --> 09:46.297
Which guilt
do you prefer, then?

09:46.365 --> 09:49.501
I have known Lorenzo since I was a girl.
I've known you a week.

09:49.569 --> 09:52.070
- That's not an answer.
- Well...

09:56.842 --> 09:58.877
The Jew they executed...

10:01.780 --> 10:03.614
What was his offence?

10:05.150 --> 10:08.219
He said he had to run
from cut-throats...

10:08.287 --> 10:11.222
and he took refuge
in a bookstore.

10:11.290 --> 10:14.392
The authorities suspect
he stole something,

10:14.459 --> 10:16.494
but nothing was missing,

10:16.562 --> 10:18.696
and the bag he carried
was empty.

10:19.665 --> 10:22.666
So, they hanged a man...

10:22.734 --> 10:25.002
for stealing something
that wasn't missing.

10:27.306 --> 10:31.075
The scene of the crime requires
further investigation.

10:33.445 --> 10:34.812
Does it?

10:40.419 --> 10:42.720
- (Door opening)
(LORENZO) Prepare the horses!

10:42.787 --> 10:44.488
<i>I want to be off at once.</i>

10:46.391 --> 10:48.158
Oh...

10:48.226 --> 10:49.894
You've finished already?

10:49.961 --> 10:53.097
Yes. Signor Da Vinci
had somewhere to be.

10:53.164 --> 10:57.100
Ah, yes.
He's testing his gun for us.

10:57.168 --> 11:00.570
Today he gives Florence
its sting...

11:02.039 --> 11:03.973
..while I show him mine.

11:05.442 --> 11:08.477
<i>It's quite considerate he</i>
<i>left us a moment to be alone.</i>

11:10.680 --> 11:14.416
Mmm... (Chuckles)

11:14.483 --> 11:17.085
Lorenzo,
anybody could walk in.

11:17.153 --> 11:18.920
I just needed a bit of you.

11:18.988 --> 11:21.056
And you will have it...

11:21.123 --> 11:22.857
for it is yours alone.

11:28.097 --> 11:31.199
- Good luck today.
- We're off!

11:35.705 --> 11:37.539
Good luck.

11:37.606 --> 11:39.507
That bit of you...

11:41.844 --> 11:43.745
It's not his alone.

11:43.813 --> 11:46.948
No...it's not.

11:47.016 --> 11:50.852
But it will always
be his first.

12:12.676 --> 12:15.444
Do you have any saltpeter?

12:15.512 --> 12:17.980
What do you need
potassium nitrate for?

12:18.048 --> 12:21.317
Gunpowder. The maestro's
designing a weapon.

12:21.384 --> 12:23.285
He calls it
the pipe-organ musket.

12:29.227 --> 12:31.361
The recoil will kill him.

12:31.429 --> 12:33.096
Don't worry.
He's worked it out.

12:33.164 --> 12:37.701
By God...he's corrupted
you already.

12:37.769 --> 12:42.105
Over there, third shelf, between the
vermillion and the ultramarine.

12:43.274 --> 12:45.742
And tell him I expect
to be paid in coin,

12:45.810 --> 12:48.679
not idle boasts,
like last time.

12:51.283 --> 12:53.684
<i>Come on.</i>

12:53.752 --> 12:56.086
- God!
- Careful, Giuliano.

12:56.154 --> 12:59.657
Fucking hell! What are we doing
here, in the middle of nowhere?

12:59.725 --> 13:02.326
- Where is he?
- Perhaps he's simply late.

13:02.394 --> 13:07.432
Or perhaps he realized what he proposed
was more than a flying party trick.

13:07.499 --> 13:10.501
I wouldn't be surprised if he had
no intention of coming here.

13:10.569 --> 13:13.905
<i>I'm telling you - the man's</i>
<i>a lunatic and a coward.</i>

13:13.972 --> 13:15.373
God! Shit!

13:15.440 --> 13:17.675
Keep control of yourself -
they're only cut-outs.

13:17.743 --> 13:21.412
<i>Quickly!</i>
<i>Soldiers advancing on Florence!</i>

13:28.887 --> 13:31.288
How...how dare you?

13:31.356 --> 13:34.281
<i>You are pointing a weapon at</i>
<i>the house of Medici!</i>

13:34.306 --> 13:35.458
<i>Men, take him!</i>

13:35.459 --> 13:38.762
- Hold.
- It passed its first test.

13:38.830 --> 13:43.133
- It's done nothing.
- No, it's done a great deal.

13:43.201 --> 13:44.801
Intimidation.

13:44.869 --> 13:48.405
Now, if you will proceed
to the gallery...

13:48.473 --> 13:52.676
...we will proceed to testing
its less ephemeral utility.

13:52.744 --> 13:54.578
<i>You've picked quite</i>
<i>a day for it.</i>

13:54.645 --> 13:56.179
- (Thunder)
- Yes. You like it?

13:56.247 --> 13:58.615
I think it adds
to the verisimilitude.

13:58.682 --> 14:01.818
I question the company
the maestro keeps.

14:01.886 --> 14:04.120
That man's a known reprobate.

14:04.188 --> 14:06.723
Are these soldiers
meant to be Swiss?

14:06.791 --> 14:09.326
- And you would be...?
- Commander Quattrone,

14:09.394 --> 14:11.728
leader
of the Florentine militia.

14:11.796 --> 14:17.200
<i>His Magnificence thought it wise </i>
<i>to bring a military strategist along.</i>

14:17.268 --> 14:19.903
In order to better
evaluate your work.

14:19.971 --> 14:24.308
- I wish I'd brought a boat.
- Well, he has a keen eye.

14:24.376 --> 14:30.548
What you see here is a representation
of Rome's private mercenary regiment.

14:30.616 --> 14:32.816
It's a bit of theatrics,

14:32.884 --> 14:35.953
but often presentation is more
than half the performance.

14:36.020 --> 14:38.155
<i>Well, get on with it,</i>
<i>Da Vinci.</i>

14:38.223 --> 14:41.325
While you delay, we drown.

14:41.393 --> 14:44.161
- Where was I?
- Yes. Come on.

14:44.229 --> 14:48.099
Quickly!
Soldiers advancing on Florence!

14:48.166 --> 14:50.534
- Yes, yes, yes.
- The man is mad.

15:07.019 --> 15:08.887
(Shrieks and groans)

15:10.823 --> 15:12.857
(Coughing and spluttering)

15:24.504 --> 15:28.873
The house of Medici has invested
hundreds of florins in this project.

15:28.941 --> 15:31.709
According to your contract, the
failure of this contraption

15:31.777 --> 15:33.945
<i>constitutes fraud.</i>

15:34.013 --> 15:36.414
Men, take him away.

15:38.150 --> 15:40.385
<i>On your feet, maestro.</i>

15:41.821 --> 15:43.955
Hold.

15:44.023 --> 15:46.992
You have one week, artista.

15:47.060 --> 15:48.660
Lorenzo, no.

15:48.728 --> 15:51.463
The materials alone will cost
another 200 florins.

15:51.531 --> 15:53.766
One week.

15:53.833 --> 15:58.137
(Groans) That sounds...quite
reasonable.

15:58.204 --> 16:00.306
(Shouting and animals
grunting)

16:02.375 --> 16:04.410
(WOMAN) I'll have two,
if the price is right.

16:13.052 --> 16:15.053
I'm gonna have words
with you, boy.

16:15.121 --> 16:18.891
We found footprints in the graveyard
where the Jew's body was stolen.

16:18.958 --> 16:24.630
A donkey's, a man's
and a child's.

16:24.698 --> 16:27.866
Long-toed poulaines...

16:27.934 --> 16:29.935
such as you are wearing.

16:30.003 --> 16:31.637
(Thud)

16:41.548 --> 16:43.348
Do you know who I am?

16:45.651 --> 16:49.186
I am Lord Girolamo Riario.

16:49.254 --> 16:52.956
Count and Captain General
of the Holy Roman Church.

16:53.725 --> 16:56.793
<i>Nephew of His Holiness...</i>

16:56.861 --> 16:58.862
..Pope Sixtus IV.

17:00.531 --> 17:04.535
Signor Morgante has informed us
of your grave-robbing exploits.

17:04.603 --> 17:08.872
- I don't know what you mean.
- Don't insult us, boy.

17:08.940 --> 17:11.108
We're well aware
of who your master is.

17:11.175 --> 17:15.112
Erm...Your Excellency, there
was the matter of payment.

17:16.548 --> 17:18.248
Hmm.

17:18.316 --> 17:19.683
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

17:20.786 --> 17:22.685
Captain Grunwald.

17:25.589 --> 17:26.824
(Grunts)

17:28.794 --> 17:30.361
(Gasps)

17:33.132 --> 17:35.033
<i>Jesus!</i>

17:36.202 --> 17:38.169
(Whimpering)

17:38.237 --> 17:41.773
Now that we've established my
propensity for directness,

17:41.840 --> 17:45.509
I trust our conversation
will proceed smoothly.

17:45.577 --> 17:50.514
Now, we're interested in why Da
Vinci required the Jew's body,

17:50.582 --> 17:54.552
and, lest you be tempted
to feign further ignorance,

17:54.619 --> 17:57.855
I wanted to demonstrate
a remarkable device

17:57.923 --> 18:01.526
I recently acquired
from the Orient.

18:01.594 --> 18:05.029
It's called...
the Widow's Tear.

18:11.470 --> 18:13.204
(Whimpering)

18:14.640 --> 18:16.508
No!

18:16.575 --> 18:21.245
<i>The source of the discomfort</i>
<i>you're feeling is an exquisitely tooled</i>

18:21.313 --> 18:25.916
diamond needle,
the titular Widow's Tear.

18:25.984 --> 18:28.819
And as I turn the handle,
the diamond...

18:28.887 --> 18:30.421
(Groans)

18:30.489 --> 18:34.158
..slowly incises
a circle of skin,

18:34.226 --> 18:38.295
from the back of the hand, one
layer of epidermis at a time.

18:38.363 --> 18:40.330
(Whimpering)

18:41.899 --> 18:47.470
Now, I want you to weigh your
next answer very, very carefully.

18:47.538 --> 18:50.840
Why did Da Vinci
unearth the Jew's body?

18:57.882 --> 19:00.483
Very well.
Another turn.

19:03.521 --> 19:05.556
<i>(Whimpering)</i>

19:11.431 --> 19:14.566
Stop! Stop, stop.

19:16.302 --> 19:20.505
<i>Shhh, shhh.</i>
<i>It's alright, Nico.</i>

19:20.573 --> 19:24.843
Just a few simple words, and we
can end all this unpleasantness.

19:27.280 --> 19:30.849
He was searching...

19:30.917 --> 19:33.786
The Jew swallowed something.

19:33.854 --> 19:36.088
What, child?

19:40.026 --> 19:41.627
A key.

19:44.431 --> 19:48.333
Leave nothing unturned.
Just find the key.

19:52.538 --> 19:54.639
<i>(MAN) Rip it apart!</i>

19:54.707 --> 19:56.040
Stop!

19:58.144 --> 19:59.945
<i>You won't find it.</i>

20:13.761 --> 20:15.961
<i>(Creaking)</i>

20:20.200 --> 20:22.268
That's what
you're looking for.

20:30.110 --> 20:33.879
- Open it.
- I can't. It's locked.

20:33.947 --> 20:35.581
Hack it apart.

20:37.584 --> 20:39.752
(Hammering and clanking)

20:44.258 --> 20:45.959
Wait a moment!

20:51.533 --> 20:55.102
<i>(MAN) Let's get out of here!</i>
<i>Hurry!</i>

20:55.170 --> 20:56.804
<i>Let's get out of here!</i>

20:56.872 --> 20:59.407
You, boy...! You...!

21:02.144 --> 21:04.812
You have defied instruments
of the Lord's will!

21:04.880 --> 21:07.415
- (Knocking)
- (MAN) Leonardo!

21:07.482 --> 21:09.684
Go! Go!

21:09.751 --> 21:13.287
<i>Leonardo! Are you alright?</i>

21:14.256 --> 21:16.057
Oh!

21:16.124 --> 21:19.026
Oh, merciful heaven!
What happened here?

21:19.094 --> 21:21.796
These men are agents
of the papacy.

21:21.864 --> 21:24.932
What, it wasn't enough to tangle
with the Medicis? Now you're...?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.401
Leo, you're talking
about the Pope.

21:27.469 --> 21:30.138
Not to worry. They could only
have our entrails torn out.

21:30.206 --> 21:33.274
Nico, who did this to you?

21:33.342 --> 21:35.743
Count Riario.

21:35.811 --> 21:37.813
The papal nephew
and attack dog?

21:37.880 --> 21:40.215
He snatched me
from the market.

21:40.283 --> 21:42.651
I told him... I'm sorry.

21:42.719 --> 21:45.054
I told him you took the key
from the Jew's body.

21:45.122 --> 21:48.692
Well, you may have told them that,
but you showed them something else.

21:48.759 --> 21:52.830
Hey, you've done something
exceptional, Nico.

21:52.897 --> 21:55.432
You've saved your own life,
into the bargain.

22:02.506 --> 22:04.674
Halt!

22:04.741 --> 22:07.443
Be still.

22:07.511 --> 22:10.447
Our visitor was expected.

22:10.515 --> 22:14.151
You know I can't be seen with you.
There are too many prying eyes.

22:14.218 --> 22:15.986
If I had been stopped
on the road...

22:19.091 --> 22:21.926
You needn't lecture me on
the necessity of discretion.

22:21.994 --> 22:26.997
I wouldn't jeopardize such a valuable
asset as yourself without ample reason.

22:30.402 --> 22:33.639
Now, take these.

22:33.706 --> 22:38.076
A list of secure locales
hidden throughout Florence.

22:38.978 --> 22:41.246
I need more information.

22:41.314 --> 22:45.217
Details of Lorenzo
and Da Vinci's activities.

22:45.285 --> 22:47.786
If you have something
pertinent to convey,

22:47.854 --> 22:50.923
inscribe the Greek
letter alpha

22:50.990 --> 22:54.359
above whichever locale
is convenient.

22:54.427 --> 22:56.995
If we have something
to convey to you,

22:57.063 --> 23:01.065
we will inscribe
the letter omega.

23:03.869 --> 23:06.070
Are you clear on all this?

23:06.138 --> 23:08.506
That's the official
papal seal.

23:08.573 --> 23:10.841
Mark your messages with it.

23:10.909 --> 23:12.943
And one final thing.

23:15.046 --> 23:16.847
What is it?

23:16.915 --> 23:18.949
Instructions will
be forthcoming.

23:19.017 --> 23:22.319
In the meantime,
keep it hidden.

23:23.255 --> 23:25.189
Now, Da Vinci...

23:25.257 --> 23:29.961
Has your celebrated artist
made any mention of a key?

23:30.028 --> 23:33.798
- What about the Jew?
- He asked about his capture.

23:33.865 --> 23:36.267
He wanted to return to
the scene of the crime.

23:36.335 --> 23:37.802
<i>That's how he put it.</i>

23:37.869 --> 23:41.172
He was preoccupied with why a
Jew would hide in a bookshop.

23:41.239 --> 23:43.908
Why would Da Vinci concern
himself with a bookshop?

23:43.975 --> 23:47.945
I don't know. Perhaps Da Vinci
is more clever than you.

23:48.013 --> 23:51.816
But then that would be
heresy, wouldn't it?

23:51.883 --> 23:54.085
Keep an eye on that bookshop.

23:54.152 --> 23:58.189
If we're lucky, Da Vinci will
complete our investigations for us.

23:58.256 --> 24:01.492
And you, Miss Donati,

24:01.560 --> 24:05.929
do continue ensnaring Lorenzo
and Da Vinci with that...

24:05.997 --> 24:07.931
pretty little cunt of yours.

24:09.567 --> 24:11.768
- You're a bastard.
- Yes.

24:11.836 --> 24:14.471
And the architect
of my pedigree

24:14.538 --> 24:17.941
is the Holy Father himself.

24:18.009 --> 24:21.645
Now, go, lest the prying eyes
of Florence see us together

24:21.713 --> 24:25.383
and question your already
compromised character.

24:30.289 --> 24:34.259
She grows more impertinent
with every encounter.

24:35.494 --> 24:38.095
<i>Hmm.</i>

24:38.163 --> 24:42.199
Even a mouse occasionally bears its
teeth when it's about to be crushed.

24:44.302 --> 24:47.638
<i>Scudos, the papal currency.</i>

24:50.007 --> 24:52.643
Let's review the events
again, Da Vinci.

24:52.710 --> 24:56.247
They took the boy
and ransacked your workshop.

24:56.314 --> 24:57.715
<i>What were they looking for?</i>

24:57.783 --> 24:59.817
My weapon designs.

24:59.885 --> 25:04.222
Well, let Rome have them. By this time next
week, they'll have decimated themselves.

25:08.226 --> 25:11.396
By this time next week,
they could decimate US!

25:11.464 --> 25:14.432
- Lorenzo...
- Open your eyes, brother!

25:14.500 --> 25:17.502
We no longer enjoy
Milan's protection.

25:17.570 --> 25:19.804
<i>I want your men to</i>
<i>surround this building.</i>

25:19.872 --> 25:22.541
<i>No-one to come in or out,</i>
<i>save Da Vinci and the boy.</i>

25:22.608 --> 25:25.777
You will accompany Da Vinci
wherever he goes.

25:25.845 --> 25:28.446
Oh, I hardly think
that's necessary!

25:28.514 --> 25:31.216
(Gasps)

25:31.284 --> 25:32.584
Go.

25:35.021 --> 25:38.290
You have three days for a
successful fire of your gun.

25:38.358 --> 25:40.892
If it fails, there will
be no second chances.

25:40.960 --> 25:44.663
There will be no trial.
You will hang.

25:47.533 --> 25:51.202
Whatever you need to accomplish
this you will possess.

25:51.270 --> 25:54.505
Money, materials, men.

25:54.573 --> 25:57.242
Make your vision real,
Da Vinci...

25:59.011 --> 26:01.480
..for your very life.

26:06.954 --> 26:10.756
When the black hood
pulls the lever...

26:10.824 --> 26:13.759
be sure to clench.
(Chuckles)

26:16.862 --> 26:20.666
Those guards are going to make it
difficult to sneak off to the tavern.

26:20.733 --> 26:24.370
- Did you hear what he said?
- Yes.

26:24.437 --> 26:26.539
(Grunts)
I need to think.

26:26.606 --> 26:29.174
And if I need to think,
I need to drink.

26:33.279 --> 26:35.681
<i>This place is wonderful.</i>

26:35.749 --> 26:38.584
So much better
than the convent.

26:38.652 --> 26:42.589
A million thanks to you,
Leonardo.

26:43.257 --> 26:45.125
<i>What are you doing?</i>

26:45.193 --> 26:49.696
I'm trying to envisage what kind of lock
the notches on this key correspond to.

27:12.421 --> 27:15.289
Nico, do you have that coin
the Turk gave you?

27:22.331 --> 27:24.532
Ahh.

27:24.599 --> 27:26.200
I thought so.

27:27.770 --> 27:29.803
Two keys.

27:40.416 --> 27:42.817
Whatever lock this
corresponds with, I'd wager

27:42.885 --> 27:47.455
the key represents only half of
the mechanism needed to open it.

27:47.523 --> 27:50.492
Leo, honestly, who cares?

27:50.560 --> 27:52.861
Just give the damn thing
to Riario.

27:52.929 --> 27:54.430
Inspiration can't be forced.

27:54.497 --> 27:55.764
Oh, well, tell that
to the hangman--

27:55.832 --> 27:57.399
Hangman: Inspiration
cannot be forced

27:57.467 --> 28:01.237
Look, the fact that Riario would
jeopardize a formal visit to acquire this

28:01.304 --> 28:03.105
is telling.

28:03.173 --> 28:06.810
Obviously, it's linked to the Book of Leaves.
The Turk confirmed it.

28:06.878 --> 28:09.046
Of course, the Turk.
Your mystery man.

28:09.113 --> 28:13.851
Yes! And since we have
a mystery here...

28:13.919 --> 28:15.553
..I intend to see it through.

28:15.621 --> 28:18.655
What mystery?
The Jew stole a key.

28:18.723 --> 28:21.858
He swallowed it to prevent
his pursuers from getting it.

28:21.926 --> 28:23.994
Why would he break
into a bookshop?

28:24.061 --> 28:27.563
That's where the key was in the first place.
That's why he broke in.

28:27.631 --> 28:29.331
<i>No, the narrative</i>
<i>doesn't hold up.</i>

28:29.399 --> 28:30.766
The bookshop reported
nothing missing.

28:30.834 --> 28:34.036
- Oh, for fuck's sake!
- And his bag was empty.

28:34.104 --> 28:39.775
And why the fingernail? And why
was the Jew being pursued...

28:39.843 --> 28:41.410
..before the bookshop?

28:49.853 --> 28:55.057
According to the Count,
the Jew crossed the piazza

28:55.125 --> 28:58.928
and then entered
the road here.

29:00.663 --> 29:04.066
Perhaps someone
witnessed the event.

29:04.134 --> 29:07.536
Please, signor,
can you offer any charity?

29:07.604 --> 29:09.671
Tell me, good man.

29:09.739 --> 29:11.674
Were you here the night
the Jew was caught?

29:11.741 --> 29:15.310
Indeed I was, for this is my
home, and I have no other.

29:15.378 --> 29:17.379
Can't you see
this man's blind?

29:17.446 --> 29:18.713
Shhh.

29:21.083 --> 29:23.751
- (Rattling)
- A florin, signor?

29:23.819 --> 29:25.820
You could identify
that by its sound?

29:25.888 --> 29:29.757
<i>I am well versed in the respective tones</i>
<i>of our realm's coinage.</i>

29:29.825 --> 29:33.394
If you would, could you describe
what you heard that night?

29:33.462 --> 29:36.697
With pleasure.
It was a cold night.

29:36.765 --> 29:40.168
<i>When I first heard the shouts,</i>
<i>I thought I was dreaming.</i>

29:40.235 --> 29:42.703
<i>They were coming</i>
<i>from the Duomo.</i>

29:42.771 --> 29:46.273
<i>Then I heard the Jew's</i>
<i>footsteps and his breath.</i>

29:46.341 --> 29:49.610
<i>He was terrified.</i>
<i>I could tell that.</i>

29:49.678 --> 29:52.614
<i>Then he fell.</i>

29:52.681 --> 29:56.317
<i>Dropped something.</i>
<i>Pages fluttering like bird's wings.</i>

29:56.385 --> 29:59.053
<i>Then I heard the Jew say,</i>
<i>'Wo, wo?'</i>

29:59.121 --> 30:01.088
Wo, wo?

30:01.156 --> 30:04.324
<i>And I heard more shouts,</i>
<i>his pursuers calling after him.</i>

30:04.392 --> 30:09.797
<i>I did not understand a word</i>
<i>they said, except for 'halt'.</i>

30:09.864 --> 30:12.199
<i>Halt.</i>

30:12.267 --> 30:14.735
How does this shed
light on your mystery?

30:14.802 --> 30:18.838
The men chasing the Jew spoke a foreign
tongue, yet they used the word 'halt'.

30:18.906 --> 30:20.607
Only German and English
use that.

30:20.674 --> 30:22.675
- So...?
- So, the Swiss mercenaries

30:22.743 --> 30:25.077
employed by Rome
speak German,

30:25.145 --> 30:27.879
and they must have assumed
the Jew understood it,

30:27.947 --> 30:31.049
since most Jews speak
Yiddish, a form of German.

30:31.117 --> 30:35.187
The word 'wo' in Yiddish
means 'where'.

30:35.254 --> 30:39.124
The Jew wasn't fearful.
He was searching for something.

30:39.191 --> 30:42.627
See, I believe he had two
items in his possession.

30:42.695 --> 30:45.997
The first was small enough
for him to swallow - the key.

30:46.065 --> 30:47.999
The second was larger,

30:48.067 --> 30:49.868
forcing him to find
a hiding-place.

30:49.936 --> 30:53.605
- A book.
- Precisely.

30:53.673 --> 30:57.242
And where would
one best hide a book?

31:03.215 --> 31:07.652
Would you mind skulking around,
making the proprietor apprehensive?

31:07.720 --> 31:09.321
Why me?

31:09.388 --> 31:11.557
Well, because
you reek of dishonesty.

31:11.624 --> 31:14.093
(Groans)
As usual.

31:14.160 --> 31:16.395
Signor Vesticci,
how goes it?

31:16.463 --> 31:19.599
Tell me - how many rows
of shelves do you have?

31:19.666 --> 31:21.167
Ten. What of it?

31:21.235 --> 31:24.905
You there - did you just stuff
something into your robes just now?

31:24.972 --> 31:28.675
I beg your pardon? I was simply
hefting the weight of this tome.

31:28.743 --> 31:31.445
The fingernail was a clue to
the second item's location.

31:31.512 --> 31:33.913
Ten shelves.
Ten fingers.

31:33.981 --> 31:36.349
Now, we're facing the west.

31:36.416 --> 31:39.899
<i>It would be more obvious,</i>
<i>when counting, to face</i>

31:39.924 --> 31:40.853
<i>the opposite direction,</i>

31:40.854 --> 31:43.623
<i>the east and the rising sun.</i>

31:45.659 --> 31:50.162
<i>Additionally, Hebrew is the</i>
<i>sacred language of the Jews,</i>

31:50.230 --> 31:51.764
<i>read from right to left.</i>

31:51.832 --> 31:55.768
<i>So, if we count</i>
<i>from the right...</i>

31:58.237 --> 32:00.739
..we get row number five.

32:00.806 --> 32:02.640
Blood.

32:02.708 --> 32:05.042
<i>Now, we know he bit</i>
<i>off his fingernail.</i>

32:07.779 --> 32:10.313
Look, Nico. There.

32:10.381 --> 32:12.782
Dust. No-one's disturbed
these books in ages.

32:12.850 --> 32:14.984
But here...

32:18.790 --> 32:20.891
There's no dust at all
on this book.

32:22.126 --> 32:24.194
Written in Hebrew, no less.

32:27.632 --> 32:30.034
I think we've found
item number two.

32:32.438 --> 32:35.307
I take it all back.
If you had tits, I'd marry you.

32:35.375 --> 32:39.311
So, you long for the soul of a
man but the breasts of a woman?

32:39.379 --> 32:41.980
You have a treacherous road
ahead, my friend.

32:50.357 --> 32:53.559
Artista, you will
come with us.

32:53.627 --> 32:59.865
If you resist... Well, just ask your
little friend about Riario's hospitality.

32:59.933 --> 33:04.237
Well, unfortunately, we will have
to decline the Count's invitation.

33:09.943 --> 33:11.477
What is that?

33:11.545 --> 33:15.315
Well, you're acquainted
with my infernal devices.

33:15.383 --> 33:18.052
The exploding chest,
in my workshop.

33:18.119 --> 33:22.289
Well, this works
on the same principle.

33:22.357 --> 33:26.059
It is a grenado.
It's packed with gunpowder.

33:26.127 --> 33:28.395
<i>Activated by a</i>
<i>push-button on its base.</i>

33:28.463 --> 33:31.699
<i>And if I remove my thumb...</i>
<i>(Gasps)</i>

33:33.502 --> 33:35.236
..the device will explode.

33:35.303 --> 33:37.839
He's lying.
It's a snuff-box.

33:37.906 --> 33:41.242
Don't test my resolve.
I do not care for you to die,

33:41.310 --> 33:43.111
on this day or any other.

33:43.179 --> 33:48.050
You think the greatest mind in all of
Europe needs to bluff? Then try us.

33:48.117 --> 33:50.385
There's a vendor nearby
that sells those things.

33:50.453 --> 33:52.554
This is Da Vinci
you're staring down.

33:52.621 --> 33:54.689
- It's a snuff-box.
- It's a fucking grenado.

33:58.828 --> 34:01.463
- Fuck me.
- Split up.

34:06.936 --> 34:09.170
After him!

34:09.239 --> 34:12.108
Halt!
You won't get away from us!

34:25.924 --> 34:27.926
Halt!

34:31.530 --> 34:33.998
<i>Halt!</i>

34:34.065 --> 34:35.734
<i>Stay where you are!</i>

34:35.802 --> 34:37.936
- Got him!
- Shit!

34:41.741 --> 34:43.408
Shit.

34:46.911 --> 34:48.780
Stop!

34:55.454 --> 34:58.289
(Yells)

34:58.356 --> 35:00.057
(Screams)

35:05.463 --> 35:07.431
(Yells)

35:11.268 --> 35:15.070
Oh, please,
give Riario my regrets!

35:15.138 --> 35:18.173
(Chuckles)

35:29.719 --> 35:32.888
Count Riario,
if you'd be so kind.

35:34.624 --> 35:37.059
<i>Signor di Medici.</i>

35:37.127 --> 35:39.061
Lady Orsini.

35:39.129 --> 35:42.732
Thank you most humbly
for the hospitality

35:42.799 --> 35:45.501
you've extended to
our modest delegation.

35:45.569 --> 35:47.703
We are only too happy

35:47.771 --> 35:50.773
to receive Rome's
favored son.

35:52.810 --> 35:55.078
Lord Girolamo.

36:02.687 --> 36:04.989
We are ecstatic.

36:06.225 --> 36:09.260
Shall you and I retire to my
study for a few moments?

36:15.100 --> 36:17.668
<i>Drop the niceties, Riario.</i>

36:17.736 --> 36:20.175
<i>Your men broke into</i>
<i>my artist's studio.</i>

36:20.200 --> 36:22.538
<i>I want to know why.</i>

36:22.541 --> 36:26.277
Word of Da Vinci has reached
the Holy Father's ears.

36:26.345 --> 36:30.982
He's tasked me with finding artisans to
adorn the great chapel he's building.

36:31.049 --> 36:33.418
I thought...

36:33.485 --> 36:35.186
Do you know what?

36:35.254 --> 36:38.056
An exploratory meeting
might be in order.

36:38.123 --> 36:41.292
And was the death of your men
part of that exploration?

36:41.360 --> 36:44.695
Only retroactively, but it taught
me a few things about your man

36:44.763 --> 36:47.064
and made me anxious
to make his acquaintance.

36:47.131 --> 36:49.599
Da Vinci is a mere
dilettante.

36:49.667 --> 36:51.501
An amusement.
Nothing more.

36:51.569 --> 36:54.204
And yet I'm told you've
advanced him a stipend

36:54.272 --> 36:56.840
of 50 florins.

36:59.877 --> 37:03.146
Quite a handsome allowance
for a mere dilettante.

37:03.214 --> 37:08.485
Rome hears
every whisper, Lorenzo.

37:08.552 --> 37:14.157
Even outlandish ones concerning artisans
capable of constructing war machines.

37:14.225 --> 37:18.027
<i>The manufacture of armaments</i>
<i>could be construed as a provocative move.</i>

37:18.095 --> 37:20.697
As could the assassination
of Duke Sforza.

37:21.933 --> 37:25.569
Or the refusal
to pay one's debts.

37:25.636 --> 37:29.006
Usury. It's such
an unseemly business.

37:29.073 --> 37:32.943
I hear the Holy Father is now borrowing
money from the Pazzi family.

37:33.011 --> 37:35.178
<i>Is he planning</i>
<i>on bilking them as well?</i>

37:36.881 --> 37:39.316
<i>Since we're on</i>
<i>the subject of provocations,</i>

37:39.384 --> 37:42.953
I believe it's time I stated
the purpose of my visit.

37:43.021 --> 37:48.258
<i>His Holiness wishes to inform you of his</i>
<i>choice for the Archbishop of Pisa.</i>

37:48.326 --> 37:50.327
Pisa falls under Florence's
jurisdiction.

37:50.395 --> 37:54.265
Nevertheless,
the selection has been made.

37:54.332 --> 37:59.436
His Holiness has appointed
Francesco Salviati.

38:01.206 --> 38:03.674
- Your cousin.
- Hmm.

38:05.844 --> 38:07.711
Well...

38:07.779 --> 38:10.881
It appears congratulations
are in order.

38:10.949 --> 38:13.016
<i>Please,</i>
<i>inform the Holy Father</i>

38:13.084 --> 38:17.054
that you and Salviati should assemble
the largest army you can find...

38:17.122 --> 38:19.256
because the only way you're
setting foot in Pisa

38:19.324 --> 38:21.692
is if I am dead and buried.

38:21.759 --> 38:23.360
I see.

38:23.428 --> 38:25.895
So, that's your
proposed condition?

38:25.963 --> 38:28.331
Rome fired the first salvo,
not I.

38:28.399 --> 38:31.268
And we intend
to fire the last.

38:37.574 --> 38:40.777
<i>Good night, Magnifico.</i>

38:44.916 --> 38:47.551
How in Christ's name

38:47.619 --> 38:49.753
did he know all that?

38:49.821 --> 38:51.589
<i>Troubling.</i>

38:55.160 --> 38:57.195
<i>(Door slamming)</i>

38:57.262 --> 38:59.564
<i>(Dogs barking)</i>

39:12.513 --> 39:15.281
You look very fetching
in your night shirt.

39:15.349 --> 39:18.851
What are you doing, skulking around?
I could have hurt you.

39:18.919 --> 39:21.153
With a drafting compass?

39:22.856 --> 39:24.757
Why are you here, Leonardo?

39:24.825 --> 39:29.295
I can't go to my quarters. The
Vatican's thugs are looking for me.

39:29.363 --> 39:33.199
Lorenzo's men have been in and out
of here all day, looking for you.

39:33.266 --> 39:36.870
Lorenzo gave me a deadline
on my musket.

39:36.937 --> 39:38.805
Frankly, I'm not sure
I can make it.

39:38.872 --> 39:40.573
<i>I'm not surprised.</i>

39:40.641 --> 39:44.444
You have three layers of cannons
on top of one another. Yes?

39:44.511 --> 39:46.346
Mm-hm.

39:46.414 --> 39:49.349
Well, there's going to be some powder
contamination between the tiers.

39:49.416 --> 39:54.020
Look, I promised Lorenzo a musket that
could be fired and loaded simultaneously.

39:54.087 --> 39:58.124
This is a dangerous game you're playing
with Lorenzo. Have you overreached?

39:58.192 --> 40:02.227
Christ, Andrea! The whole point
of progress is overreaching.

40:02.295 --> 40:04.730
Why doesn't anyone
understand that?

40:10.805 --> 40:12.339
Drink.

40:14.108 --> 40:17.678
Now, do you want to tell me
what this is all really about?

40:23.418 --> 40:27.354
Have you heard
of the Book of Leaves?

40:29.157 --> 40:31.558
It's a myth.
No more real than a unicorn.

40:31.626 --> 40:33.660
- I believe it exists.
- A book of wonders,

40:33.728 --> 40:36.930
containing the secret history
of the world? Please!

40:37.832 --> 40:40.800
The Jew that was hanged. Hm?

40:40.868 --> 40:42.769
This was his.

40:42.836 --> 40:46.372
Your Hebrew's better than mine. Perhaps
you can tell me what it concerns.

40:53.881 --> 40:58.584
It's...it's a treatise
on the origins of the universe.

40:59.953 --> 41:02.821
Astronomy.

41:02.889 --> 41:05.190
It keeps referring
to the Vault of Heaven,

41:05.258 --> 41:07.191
how it can be opened.

41:07.259 --> 41:09.327
Or perhaps... Ah-ha.

41:09.394 --> 41:12.263
So, the Vault of Heaven
could refer to the night sky.

41:12.331 --> 41:15.666
So, perhaps the Book can be found
by looking for a constellation.

41:15.734 --> 41:18.436
Leo, give up
on this fool's errand

41:18.503 --> 41:20.370
and focus on your commission.

41:20.438 --> 41:22.940
Stop borrowing trouble
based on a fable.

41:26.444 --> 41:28.178
This fable...

41:30.715 --> 41:33.183
is bound up in the fate
of my mother.

41:38.322 --> 41:43.659
I can draw anything I've
seen, Andrea. Anything.

41:43.727 --> 41:46.728
<i>But I can't draw her face.</i>

41:46.796 --> 41:48.597
I've tried. I can't.

41:48.664 --> 41:52.934
<i>I can't.</i>
<i>I just can't remember it.</i>

41:53.002 --> 41:55.270
If there's any knowledge
to be had of her

41:55.337 --> 41:58.206
bound up in this quest...

41:58.274 --> 42:00.308
..I need to see it through.

42:02.111 --> 42:05.814
Then your need will most likely
end up getting you killed.

42:07.583 --> 42:09.350
Hmm.

42:20.296 --> 42:22.030
(Music and laughter)

42:26.469 --> 42:29.838
<i>He told me the linens</i>
<i>were from Naples.</i>

42:29.906 --> 42:32.274
Isn't that right, dear?

42:32.341 --> 42:34.777
Me, a textile merchant.

42:34.844 --> 42:39.281
I suggested he start getting his wine
from the Orient, while he's at it.

42:39.349 --> 42:42.317
Shouldn't you be working
on Lorenzo's musket?

42:42.385 --> 42:45.721
Well, unlike you, I'm capable of
doing two things at the same time.

42:45.788 --> 42:48.823
Drinking and digging
your own grave.

42:58.167 --> 42:59.834
Yours.

43:01.804 --> 43:05.272
The question you asked
of me earlier.

43:05.340 --> 43:07.641
Which gift do I prefer?

43:11.846 --> 43:13.814
<i>You seem very uncomfortable.</i>

43:13.881 --> 43:16.416
I don't often attend
affairs such as this.

43:16.484 --> 43:21.854
Well, I do. It's a confection
of pretence and masks.

43:21.922 --> 43:25.125
Smile. Lorenzo's watching us.

43:30.498 --> 43:32.365
(Clapping hands)

43:32.433 --> 43:37.137
Your pardons and indulgences.
Your pardons and indulgences.

43:37.205 --> 43:40.774
Welcome, all of you...

43:40.841 --> 43:43.043
..to a feast of Florence,

43:43.110 --> 43:46.513
<i>so full of life and vibrancy.</i>

43:46.581 --> 43:47.981
(Applause)

43:48.049 --> 43:50.317
So like Eden.

43:50.385 --> 43:52.086
(Pipes and drums playing)

43:52.154 --> 43:55.523
<i>Full of fresh fruits.</i>

43:58.393 --> 44:01.129
<i>Full of bird and game.</i>

44:13.743 --> 44:16.711
Full of nature's grace.

44:32.427 --> 44:34.495
(Hissing)

44:34.563 --> 44:36.364
(Applause)

44:39.869 --> 44:42.237
So like Eden...

44:42.305 --> 44:46.909
but, of course,
Eden had guests.

44:49.713 --> 44:51.847
- As do we.
- (Laughter)

44:51.915 --> 44:56.253
<i>Of course, our guest is somewhat</i>
<i>more pleasant than the serpent.</i>

44:56.320 --> 44:57.521
(Laughter)

44:57.588 --> 45:01.658
Please let us welcome
Count Girolamo Riario,

45:01.726 --> 45:03.694
emissary from Rome,

45:03.762 --> 45:07.265
<i>to our Eden, to our Florence.</i>

45:13.173 --> 45:16.175
<i>Dinner is served.</i>

45:26.553 --> 45:28.588
<i>(Door opens)</i>

45:29.656 --> 45:31.157
<i>What do you see?</i>

45:33.260 --> 45:37.063
I know who you are; you know who I am.
We both know what's transpired.

45:37.131 --> 45:39.532
<i>Now, tell me:</i>
<i>what do you see?</i>

45:39.600 --> 45:43.503
I believe I saw someone call you a
snake in front of all those people.

45:45.372 --> 45:49.141
And I see a key that you
will be giving to me...

45:49.209 --> 45:51.544
..along with what you took
from that bookstore.

45:51.612 --> 45:55.414
Well, both the key and the book
the Jew hid are quite useless,

45:55.482 --> 45:59.618
unless one has the intellect required
to find the Vault of Heaven.

45:59.685 --> 46:01.553
- Then I'll have you as well.
- Why would I

46:01.621 --> 46:03.388
surrender myself to Rome?

46:03.456 --> 46:06.158
Perhaps you value your life?

46:08.361 --> 46:10.496
Not enough to betray
Florence.

46:10.564 --> 46:12.931
Then...

46:12.999 --> 46:16.001
perhaps you value the life
of another a little more.

46:18.437 --> 46:20.292
<i>I know desire when I see it,</i>

46:20.317 --> 46:24.008
<i>and I am very well versed</i>
<i>in the myriad ways</i>

46:24.010 --> 46:26.578
of exploiting it.

46:26.646 --> 46:31.617
You know, this doesn't have
to be contentious, Da Vinci.

46:31.685 --> 46:35.754
Join us, and the whole
of the Vatican's secret archives

46:35.822 --> 46:37.556
can be at your disposal.

46:37.624 --> 46:39.959
You're offering me
forbidden fruit now.

46:41.895 --> 46:44.364
That's what serpents do,
isn't it?

46:48.236 --> 46:50.303
<i>Meet me tomorrow at sunrise.</i>

46:50.371 --> 46:55.776
And then the key, all of its
secrets...can be yours.

46:55.844 --> 46:58.112
And your services?

46:58.180 --> 47:01.449
Surely, if I'm to find the Book of
Leaves, I'll need those, as well?

47:44.194 --> 47:47.430
<i>- What is he doing?</i>
<i>- He's playing with a bottle.</i>

47:47.497 --> 47:49.232
<i>Of course he is.</i>

47:49.299 --> 47:51.834
I'll admit he eluded us once,

47:51.902 --> 47:54.437
but this time
we're ready for him.

47:54.504 --> 47:56.005
(Horses' hooves)

47:57.941 --> 48:00.876
<i>There. It makes sense.</i>

48:00.943 --> 48:04.079
He was already working
with the Roman scum.

48:34.378 --> 48:36.579
<i>Do we need any more proof?</i>

48:36.647 --> 48:38.681
He is complicit with them.

48:39.984 --> 48:42.318
<i>Consider this a retainer.</i>

48:42.386 --> 48:44.554
For your services to Rome.

48:46.456 --> 48:48.524
<i>Why do you hesitate,</i>
<i>Da Vinci?</i>

48:48.592 --> 48:50.726
This is the next step.

48:50.794 --> 48:53.362
Sorry. I don't follow you.

48:54.164 --> 48:56.298
Why did you exhume the Jew?

48:56.366 --> 48:59.968
Why do you endeavor
to find the Vault?

49:00.036 --> 49:02.571
I don't endeavor.

49:02.639 --> 49:04.940
I've found it.

49:05.008 --> 49:09.778
The Vault of Heaven, which, presumably,
contains the Book of Leaves.

49:09.846 --> 49:13.549
I've had it put on wheels, so I
might move it for safekeeping.

49:13.617 --> 49:18.454
Apparently,
it requires two keys to open.

49:18.522 --> 49:23.392
The Jew. The Vault. The Book.

49:23.460 --> 49:27.096
You've done all this,
because you want to know

49:27.163 --> 49:29.131
what's next.

49:29.199 --> 49:31.366
<i>Between the base animal</i>
<i>clawing for money</i>

49:31.434 --> 49:34.870
<i>and the enlightened man's</i>
<i>reach for God</i>

49:34.938 --> 49:37.640
lies knowledge.

49:37.708 --> 49:41.511
You just want to know
what's next. I do too.

49:41.579 --> 49:44.114
Oh, that's not what you want.

49:44.182 --> 49:46.584
You want to suppress
knowledge.

49:46.651 --> 49:50.121
No. I want to administer it.

49:50.189 --> 49:53.792
Someone has to.
Why not an agent of God?

49:53.859 --> 49:58.831
Well, if God exists, surely, He intended
His knowledge to be shared by all?

49:58.899 --> 50:03.235
The truth is, progress
frightens you and your ilk.

50:03.303 --> 50:07.540
(Chuckles) Not at all.
We embrace it.

50:07.607 --> 50:11.110
Really?! Really?

50:11.178 --> 50:14.814
Are we at an impasse, then?

50:14.882 --> 50:17.851
That would be unfortunate.

50:17.918 --> 50:21.188
This is your last chance
for an amicable partnership.

50:22.156 --> 50:24.123
I decline your offer.

50:25.626 --> 50:30.497
(Shouting) I pledge allegiance
to Lorenzo the Magnificent,

50:30.565 --> 50:32.466
his foolish brother,

50:32.534 --> 50:35.402
<i>and the whole of Florence!</i>

50:35.470 --> 50:37.804
You want to tame Florence,

50:37.872 --> 50:40.440
but I prefer it wild,

50:40.507 --> 50:43.209
<i>for all its quirks</i>
<i>and criminals.</i>

50:43.277 --> 50:46.346
<i>So, why don't you scurry</i>
<i>on back to Rome</i>

50:46.413 --> 50:51.417
and tell your Pope that
neither Florence nor Da Vinci

50:51.485 --> 50:53.286
will be contained?

50:53.353 --> 50:55.521
(Explosions)

50:55.588 --> 50:57.089
(Screams)

50:59.759 --> 51:02.562
You hurt my friend!

51:03.263 --> 51:06.699
Go! Run, you fools!

51:09.470 --> 51:12.072
(Screams)

51:34.895 --> 51:37.196
(Gasping and choking)

51:40.401 --> 51:42.401
I'm sorry.

51:47.608 --> 51:49.542
I did warn you.

52:08.796 --> 52:13.000
<i>Why aren't we meeting</i>
<i>at the palace?</i>

52:13.068 --> 52:16.905
I come here to retreat
from public life.

52:16.972 --> 52:21.276
And the words I would have with
you aren't meant to be public.

52:21.343 --> 52:24.812
I believe there may
be a spy in my court.

52:24.880 --> 52:27.716
<i>Riario knew the details</i>
<i>of our arrangement,</i>

52:27.783 --> 52:31.386
the exact amount of the
stipend I've advanced you.

52:33.956 --> 52:37.225
You suspect my allegiance?

52:39.629 --> 52:41.630
No.

52:41.698 --> 52:45.300
No, the fact that you just
killed six of the papal guard

52:45.368 --> 52:47.336
<i>releases you from</i>
<i>the circle of suspicion.</i>

52:47.404 --> 52:49.204
Hmm.

52:49.272 --> 52:52.975
No, you wanted me to witness your
meeting with Riario today, didn't you?

52:53.043 --> 52:55.444
What makes you say that?

52:55.512 --> 53:00.116
Well, you managed to evade my officers,
even though I insisted they watch over you,

53:00.184 --> 53:02.719
and then today,
conveniently, you slip up.

53:02.786 --> 53:05.454
<i>You intended for us to track</i>
<i>you to the quarry.</i>

53:05.522 --> 53:10.192
I thought you'd appreciate seeing the gun
work on real opponents, not wooden ones.

53:10.260 --> 53:12.327
How did you fix
the gun's flaws?

53:12.395 --> 53:14.529
The cannons needed
more separation,

53:14.597 --> 53:17.299
so the rotating drum
I fashioned did just that.

53:17.366 --> 53:20.168
And can your musket now be
produced on a large scale?

53:20.236 --> 53:24.473
Well, given the resources,
absolutely.

53:24.541 --> 53:26.842
Then you will have them.

53:26.909 --> 53:29.278
You have done well, Da Vinci.

53:29.345 --> 53:32.381
We struck Riario
quite a blow today.

53:34.217 --> 53:37.118
But it won't be long
before he retaliates.

53:37.186 --> 53:39.187
Lorenzo,
we don't have much...

53:41.423 --> 53:44.358
- I thought we were alone.
- It's all right, Lucrezia.

53:44.426 --> 53:46.493
It's only Da Vinci.

53:46.561 --> 53:49.396
And I trust we can rely
on his discretion.

53:50.732 --> 53:53.400
Absolutely.

53:53.468 --> 53:55.602
Good man.

53:55.670 --> 53:58.304
<i>Get to work, maestro.</i>

53:58.372 --> 54:01.541
Florence is counting on you.

54:23.664 --> 54:25.198
(Chuckles)

54:27.067 --> 54:28.868
Why do you laugh?

54:28.935 --> 54:31.103
One day, Lupo,

54:31.171 --> 54:35.775
all that you see here will
fall under Rome's rule.

54:35.842 --> 54:38.945
And if that day happens
a bit further down the road,

54:39.012 --> 54:42.749
because of Da Vinci's
intervention...

54:42.816 --> 54:44.717
..so be it.

54:44.785 --> 54:46.385
But he has the key.

54:48.188 --> 54:51.424
That makes him one step closer
to obtaining the Book of Leaves.

54:51.492 --> 54:55.228
Let him keep it for now.
At least we know where it is.

54:55.296 --> 55:00.833
And besides...the key is useless
without its counterpart.

55:00.901 --> 55:03.469
And what if Da Vinci
obtains that?

55:05.005 --> 55:07.573
He won't.

55:07.641 --> 55:09.075
How do you know?

55:10.944 --> 55:13.045
Because I have it!
(Chuckles)

55:18.284 --> 55:21.419
And now you know,
dear Lupo...

55:21.487 --> 55:25.890
..why I find the whole
affair so amusing.

55:38.137 --> 55:40.472
<i>Why the long face, Leo?</i>

55:40.540 --> 55:42.474
<i>The maestro's</i>
<i>never satisfied.</i>

55:42.542 --> 55:47.045
The possibility of perfection, another
puzzle looming over the horizon.

55:47.113 --> 55:49.214
How many letters are
in the Hebrew alphabet?

55:49.282 --> 55:51.717
27.

55:51.784 --> 55:54.386
There are 27 illustrations
in this book.

55:54.454 --> 55:55.788
<i>So...?</i>

55:57.624 --> 56:00.025
Have you gone mad?

56:00.093 --> 56:01.960
Help me move this table back.

56:03.663 --> 56:08.834
Hebrew, as we've already established,
is written from right to left.

56:10.703 --> 56:16.607
If the first illustration corresponds
with the first page of the alphabet...

56:16.675 --> 56:18.108
Aleph.

56:18.176 --> 56:21.111
..and the second page
corresponds with the second...

56:21.179 --> 56:23.480
- Beth.
- ..and the third page

56:23.548 --> 56:25.449
follows the same pattern...

56:25.516 --> 56:26.917
Gimel.

56:26.985 --> 56:29.853
Do you see how the gold lines
up from one page to the next?

56:29.921 --> 56:32.089
<i>Have you heard</i>
<i>of steganography?</i>

56:32.157 --> 56:34.392
It's cryptography developed
by the Greeks.

56:34.460 --> 56:36.527
It means 'concealed writing'.

56:36.595 --> 56:40.030
It's basically hiding a coded
message in plain sight.

56:40.098 --> 56:44.468
- Leaves in a forest.
- Make a grid of three rows,

56:44.536 --> 56:46.470
each of them nine across...

56:46.538 --> 56:49.640
- What is it?
- Patience, Nico.

56:49.708 --> 56:51.975
As with most puzzles...

56:52.043 --> 56:55.512
it needs to be viewed from
a different perspective.

56:57.248 --> 56:59.149
(Creaking and whirring)

57:01.885 --> 57:04.821
The Vault of Heaven
isn't a metaphor.

57:04.888 --> 57:07.056
It's an actual vault,

57:07.124 --> 57:09.993
containing
the Book of Leaves.

57:10.060 --> 57:12.762
And that, gentlemen,

57:12.830 --> 57:16.733
is a map, detailing
the vault's location.

57:16.801 --> 57:19.436
The land this describes
doesn't exist.

57:19.504 --> 57:23.407
Well, then, we'll just have
to discover it, won't we?
