00:37.454 --> 00:39.956
There you go, Captain,
just the way you like it.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.082
Oh, you're done?

00:41.166 --> 00:42.375
Yeah, I cut it quick

00:42.459 --> 00:44.294
because I really know your head.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.587
And I don't know what you'd do

00:45.670 --> 00:47.213
if I was ever out on maneuvers

00:47.297 --> 00:48.673
or became a POW.

00:48.757 --> 00:49.924
I guess I'd go to him.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.718
Or him or him.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.179
We're getting worried over nothing.

00:54.262 --> 00:55.722
How'd you like to see the back?

01:05.023 --> 01:05.940
Yep.

01:06.441 --> 01:07.317
Yup.

01:07.692 --> 01:08.735
Mm-hmm.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.361


01:11.029 --> 01:12.447
If I never went back to work,

01:12.530 --> 01:13.948
I don't think anyone would notice.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.325
Sure they would, Bill,

01:15.408 --> 01:18.036
when there's suddenly
enough food to go around.

01:19.204 --> 01:22.332
The point I'm trying to make is
you're fat.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.250
I don't know, with all the reservists,

01:24.334 --> 01:25.460
there's a lot of fat guys.

01:25.543 --> 01:27.796
But guys who are as bald as you are, too?

01:27.879 --> 01:30.006
Hey, I heard a funny joke the other day.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.008
Uh, it was, uh,

01:32.092 --> 01:33.176
uh, wait, that was

01:33.259 --> 01:35.637
more of an interesting grill order,
I guess.

01:36.679 --> 01:38.223
Yeah, yeah, that's pretty good, Hank.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.728
Well, we've seen him like this before,

01:43.812 --> 01:45.855
and it ended with me spending Christmas

01:45.939 --> 01:47.732
pulling his head out of the oven.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.651
Now, we're gonna help him,
and we're gonna start

01:49.734 --> 01:51.694
by putting an end to all the insults.

01:51.778 --> 01:52.695
But, Hank, he's a--

01:52.779 --> 01:53.738
No, Dale.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.031
He knows he's bald,

01:55.115 --> 01:56.407
he knows he's got a gut,

01:56.491 --> 01:58.493
and he knows his wife ran around on him.

01:58.576 --> 01:59.953
He doesn't need you reminding him.

02:03.414 --> 02:07.293
Uh, kinda... thought
you'd gone home there, Bill.

02:09.754 --> 02:12.298
Mom, do you know what the heck this is?

02:12.382 --> 02:13.925
I found it in the closet,

02:14.008 --> 02:14.968
and I was gonna give it

02:15.051 --> 02:16.386
to Joseph to burn.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.887
My Pong!

02:17.971 --> 02:19.514
-Your what?
-Pong.

02:19.597 --> 02:22.600
It's only the single greatest
video game ever invented.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.478
So, what am I up against here? Zombies?

02:25.562 --> 02:28.022
Serial killers? Drug dealers?

02:28.106 --> 02:30.316
Nope. Two lines and a dot.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.488
That's it?

02:35.572 --> 02:36.781
That's the whole game?

02:36.865 --> 02:39.242
It's even more boring than real tennis.

02:39.325 --> 02:42.370
That's because you don't know
how to put... English on it!

02:44.622 --> 02:46.749
"English," you say.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.753
Bill, I'm taking you
to the one place in town

02:50.837 --> 02:53.047
that can fix whatever you got going on.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.508
You know, the despair and whatnot.

02:59.262 --> 03:02.515
I'm so glad you'll be helping out
with Seniors Bingo Night.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.809
Your main job
is to wake them after the game

03:04.893 --> 03:06.060
and tell them where they are.

03:09.230 --> 03:11.482
It's been so long since I met someone

03:11.566 --> 03:13.860
who shared my interest in helping people.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.737
Mm-hm. I know how you feel.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.158
With those strong legs,

03:20.283 --> 03:22.702
you should be able to carry
a lot of bibles, eh?

03:24.370 --> 03:26.581
And, uh, maybe after,

03:26.664 --> 03:28.708
I could get you to hang some decorations.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.835
I shouldn't be climbing ladders.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.433
Singing for Kris...

06:32.517 --> 06:34.936
Well, there's no way to describe it.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.772
Oh, and the love the guys have
for each other.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.816
Easy, Dale.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.818
And look at these nifty uniforms.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.653
This shirt is pretty sharp, huh?

06:43.736 --> 06:45.488
Hank, for god's sake!

06:45.571 --> 06:46.823
It cost me a pretty penny,

06:46.906 --> 06:50.868
but as Kris says,
"You got to spend money to make...

06:50.952 --> 06:52.453
mmm... magic!"

06:55.998 --> 06:58.501
Well, I'm off to practice my moves.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.673
Oh, man. Dang ol'... Huh.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.716
Well, I know we were hoping

07:05.800 --> 07:08.678
he'd chose something
a little less... god-awful,

07:08.761 --> 07:11.264
but it seems to be keeping him
out of the morgue.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.021
All right, let's go everybody. Warm-ups.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.565

07:35.621 --> 07:38.374
Does everyone know the most
important word in this chorus?

07:38.458 --> 07:39.333
-Pitch?
-Rhythm?

07:39.417 --> 07:40.460
Fun?

07:40.543 --> 07:41.544
Sacrifice!

07:41.627 --> 07:44.964
We all have a lot of competing pressures
in our lives.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.424
People are gonna tell you

07:46.507 --> 07:48.551
there's more important things
than the chorus.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.054
You laugh, but I've heard it all.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.807
"I can't do the chorus,
my son has a football game."

07:54.891 --> 07:56.851
"I can't do the chorus,
I have to go to work."

07:56.934 --> 07:59.520
"I can't do the chorus,
we have couples therapy."

07:59.604 --> 08:01.105
What do we think of that, Joe?

08:01.189 --> 08:02.398
We need to be strong!

08:02.482 --> 08:03.774
So, what are we gonna do?

08:03.858 --> 08:07.278
Tune them out!

08:07.361 --> 08:08.446
All right, then.

08:08.529 --> 08:10.990
Okay, let's all welcome
our newbie, William.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.576
So, William, are you wearing?

08:13.659 --> 08:14.535
What?

08:14.619 --> 08:16.871
Everyone in the chorus
wears the same custom underwear.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.956
It gives us a tremendous feeling
of community.

08:19.040 --> 08:19.874
I'm so sorry.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.584
Please, please don't kick me out!

08:21.667 --> 08:23.794
It's okay, Bill, you're new.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.130
You see, in olden times,

08:26.214 --> 08:28.424
brothers swore their loyalty to each other

08:28.508 --> 08:30.384
and took an oath with their very blood.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.763
We wear silk underpants.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.974
Those underpants symbolize our commitment.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.184
Like Otto here.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.686
He flies in from Amsterdam
almost every week.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.480
But we all have stories.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.901
What kind of underpants
do you wanna put on tomorrow morning?

08:46.984 --> 08:47.860
Silk!

08:58.037 --> 08:59.288
Military Grooming and Hygiene.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.289
Captain Hart speaking.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.874
<i>Good morning, Captain Hart.</i>

09:01.958 --> 09:04.710
<i>I regret to inform you that I am too sick</i>

09:04.794 --> 09:07.088
<i>to perform my barbering duties today.</i>

09:07.171 --> 09:09.715
<i>I will need to use one of my sick days.</i>

09:55.219 --> 09:57.263
You are going down, little man!

09:57.346 --> 09:59.140
You got no game, Mom!

09:59.223 --> 10:00.182
No game!

10:00.266 --> 10:01.559
Yeah? Here I come!

10:01.642 --> 10:02.685
How you like me now?

10:02.768 --> 10:03.936
You're not ready?

10:04.020 --> 10:05.521
Bill's show's in an hour.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.480
We're not going, Hank.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.942
I'm trying to teach Bobby
an important lesson in humility.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.235
Shee-yah!

10:16.907 --> 10:18.909
Well, it's probably a bad idea,

10:18.993 --> 10:21.078
but I'm gonna keep an open mind.

10:23.748 --> 10:26.292
Hey, Nancy has that same blouse.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.294
Three adults.

10:28.377 --> 10:29.837
You guys are big fans of the 'Holics, huh?

10:29.920 --> 10:32.006
Uh... uh, I guess.

10:32.089 --> 10:32.965
I love 'em too.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.050
What's your favorite song?

10:34.133 --> 10:36.886
Uh... So, uh, so that was three adults.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.095
I know what you're thinking.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.221
If this guy loves them so much,

10:39.305 --> 10:40.765
why doesn't he get off his butt
and tour with them?

10:40.848 --> 10:42.516
Well, Kris had other plans for me.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.560
Let's face it. If I'm sewing
the names on the underwear,

10:44.644 --> 10:46.562
that's more time for them
to be focusing on the music.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.814
And I also get to run their fan club
out of my house.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.149
The Harmonaholicholics.

10:50.232 --> 10:51.108
Here's all the info.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.824
What's up, Otto? You wearin'?

10:58.908 --> 10:59.992
You know it. You wearing?

11:00.076 --> 11:01.243
Wearin' like a baron.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.536

11:58.676 --> 12:00.469
One more song!

12:06.684 --> 12:07.560

Yup.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.275
Oh. Mm-hmm.

12:14.358 --> 12:16.694
So, what'd you guys think of the show?

12:16.777 --> 12:19.196
Normally, I'd tell you to go to my blog,

12:19.280 --> 12:21.615
but even that's being censored by Hank.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.367
Maybe you should ask him.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.952
Well, it was, uh...

12:25.035 --> 12:26.787
you know, it had its, uh,

12:27.455 --> 12:28.831
features and, uh...

12:29.665 --> 12:31.792
So you're really getting
something out of this, huh?

12:31.876 --> 12:33.961
Oh, yeah, I'm so lucky.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.546
Sometimes I can't believe

12:35.629 --> 12:38.048
that they let a guy like me
stay in the chorus.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.718
That's why I have to sacrifice
more than anyone

12:40.801 --> 12:43.095
to let them know I deserve to be a 'Holic.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.722
What do you mean "sacrifice"?

12:44.805 --> 12:48.142
Well, I spend most of my paycheck
on gloves and top hats.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.603
Both my toes have hammered
because of all the dancing,

12:50.686 --> 12:52.855
plus, I used up all my sick time.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.982
The Army thinks I've got hepatitis.

12:55.065 --> 12:56.066
The bad one.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.569
Wait, you're lying to the US Army?

12:58.652 --> 13:00.362
I have to do what I have to do, Hank.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.281
The chorus demands sacrifice.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.241
Well, sacrifice is a great thing

13:04.325 --> 13:05.993
for your country or family,

13:06.076 --> 13:08.496
but you can't give your
life away to these guys.

13:08.579 --> 13:09.497
Brian did.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.207
-Bill, you're--
-No, Dale.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.833
Bill,

13:12.917 --> 13:13.876
I think you've--

13:16.337 --> 13:18.088
Dangit, Bill, you're gonna listen to me.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.257
I'm not gonna let you
throw everything away

13:20.341 --> 13:22.009
just so you can sing with a bunch of...

13:22.092 --> 13:23.219
A bunch of...

13:23.302 --> 13:24.595
A bunch of guys.

13:24.678 --> 13:25.888
"Guys?"

13:25.971 --> 13:27.765
You gotta let me in on this, Hank!

13:27.890 --> 13:29.058
No, Dale!

13:29.141 --> 13:32.394
But, Hank, this is my chance
to be part of something special.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.646
You have a job.

13:33.729 --> 13:37.358
I'm not saying you shouldn't sing
if you feel you have to.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.860
You should just keep it in perspective.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.154
Mm, perspective.

13:42.613 --> 13:43.864
I got you, Hank.

13:51.622 --> 13:52.498
Dauterive,

13:52.581 --> 13:55.543
General Murray is coming in
for a haircut at 1900 hours.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.086
But I got plans tonight.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.420
You're not going anywhere.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.797
You've got no vacation days,

13:59.922 --> 14:02.424
you've got no sick days,
and Dawson is on maneuvers.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.051
At 1900 hours, you better be here

14:04.134 --> 14:05.469
with a scissors in one hand
and a comb in the other

14:05.553 --> 14:07.054
or you're AWOL, you got that, Sergeant?

14:17.356 --> 14:18.232
Done.

Huh.

14:38.210 --> 14:42.423
So, uh, I noticed a lot of those
chorus guys had wives.

14:42.506 --> 14:43.382
Yup.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.134
Mm. Mm-hmm.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.762
Excuse me, gentlemen, I'm Captain Hart.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.431
I'm looking for Sergeant Dauterive.

14:50.514 --> 14:53.392
Hank Hill, Assistant Manager,
Strickland Propane.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.394
And don't worry, I talked to Bill, sir.

14:55.477 --> 14:56.812
He should be at his post.

14:56.896 --> 14:57.980
Well, he's not.

14:58.063 --> 15:01.358
If Dauterive isn't at his chair
by 1900 hours, he is AWOL.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.861
He's one missed hair cut away
from a court-martial

15:03.986 --> 15:05.654
and a dishonorable discharge.

15:08.198 --> 15:10.701
Goddang Harmonaholics!

15:10.784 --> 15:12.453
Okay, we've got to find Bill.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.955
Yeah, man, like a dang ol' needle
in a haystack, man.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.457
How you gonna do that, man?

15:23.047 --> 15:24.798
Remember us from the concert?

15:25.382 --> 15:28.260
Somehow I made my way
onto your mailing list.

15:28.344 --> 15:31.388
We need to know where
the chorus went to and pronto.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.182
You mean the PBS telethon in Dallas?

15:33.265 --> 15:34.475
It's gonna rock!

15:34.558 --> 15:35.851
Come on, guys. You heard him.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.186
Let's find that station.

15:37.269 --> 15:38.604
Hey, man, what you talkin' bout?

15:38.687 --> 15:41.190
Dang ol' Cowboys versus Dolphins, man...

15:41.273 --> 15:42.566
Monday night, man.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.736
Lord forgive me for saying this, but...

15:45.819 --> 15:47.363
...there will be other games.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.114
Wait!

15:49.198 --> 15:52.242
I can't send a Harmonaholicholic away
without at least a cup of tea.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.452
Come on in, you guys.

15:53.535 --> 15:56.163
You can sit on the couch Kris slept on
when he missed his plane.

15:56.246 --> 15:57.790
Look.

15:57.873 --> 16:00.334
You seem like a nice guy,
so I'll tell you this

16:00.417 --> 16:01.585
for your own good.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.796
Judging by the two times I've met you,

16:03.879 --> 16:06.006
your life has been a waste so far.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.675
Forget these chorus guys

16:07.758 --> 16:09.051
and find a nice girl

16:09.134 --> 16:12.805
or at least something productive to do,
like a stamp collection.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.682
Your local postmaster can help you.

16:14.765 --> 16:15.849
Here's his number.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.731
I have this important haircut
with the General.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.025
Do you think anyone would notice
if I leave early?

16:25.109 --> 16:26.777
Leave early?

16:28.445 --> 16:29.780
Did I just hear what I think I heard?

16:29.863 --> 16:31.198
Probably. You're never wrong.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.033
This is a chor-us, William.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.368
Not a chor-me.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.789
If you leave, Otto's gonna turn and sing

16:38.872 --> 16:42.209
"I Want to Know What Love Is" to nobody!

16:42.292 --> 16:43.836
He'll look like a fool!

16:55.848 --> 16:57.516
Don't you have homework to do?

16:57.599 --> 16:59.476
Don't you have housework?

16:59.977 --> 17:02.021
I gotta take a bathroom break.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.188
Fine. Go ahead.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.982
-But...
-That's Pong, kiddo.

17:14.158 --> 17:15.743
We can only

17:15.826 --> 17:19.621
bring you this kind of quality
commercial-free programming

17:19.705 --> 17:22.291
through the generosity
of viewers like you,

17:22.374 --> 17:25.377
and McDonald's, home of the McGriddle.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.213
McDonald's... I'm lovin' it.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.721
Dangit!

17:35.804 --> 17:36.680
Where is he?

17:40.768 --> 17:42.770

17:46.774 --> 17:48.108

Last week's ten is this week's seven,
do you understand?

17:51.945 --> 17:54.031
Hands in, Harmonaholics on three.

17:54.114 --> 17:55.365
One, two--

17:55.449 --> 17:56.825
No!

17:57.076 --> 17:58.827
Okay, we made it.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.163
Come on, Bill,
let's get you back to the base

18:01.246 --> 18:02.706
before you ruin your life.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.708
But I've got the music in me, Hank.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.836
Okay, let's all tune this out.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.505
No. Tune me in.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.757
Bill, you're committing a crime.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.258
And you're abetting a crime.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.220
A crime would be to deny the world this.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.933
But, Bill, you're gonna be AWOL!

18:21.016 --> 18:22.518
You're gonna get court-martialed!

18:24.144 --> 18:26.021
Okay, you guys are up.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.233
Come on, Bill.

18:29.942 --> 18:30.776
William.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.031
Dangit, Bill.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.866
Why won't you just listen to reason?

18:39.785 --> 18:41.954
Okay, Dale. Help him.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.789
Wait, is this a trick?

18:43.872 --> 18:45.707
Nope, let 'er rip.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.209
Just keep it clean.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.252
Bill!

18:48.335 --> 18:51.213
Bill, you have to be
the stupidest man on the planet

18:51.296 --> 18:53.090
to think this is a good idea!

18:53.173 --> 18:54.883
Have you seen what you're wearing?

18:54.967 --> 18:58.262
That outfit makes you look
like a sequined train wreck!

18:58.345 --> 18:59.680
Look at you!

18:59.763 --> 19:02.432
You're part of a 12-headed jackass!

19:02.516 --> 19:05.185
This chorus is the feces

19:05.269 --> 19:09.773
that is produced when shame
eats too much stupidity!

19:09.857 --> 19:13.277
You people make me envy
the deaf and the blind!

19:13.861 --> 19:15.112
Underwear!

19:15.195 --> 19:16.029
Money!

19:16.113 --> 19:17.239
Fat!

19:18.448 --> 19:20.868
But I belong to something great here.

19:20.951 --> 19:23.412
I even got a nickname... William.

19:25.205 --> 19:27.124
Hank.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.168
Bill, you already have a nickname.

19:29.251 --> 19:32.045
Army Sergeant "not in jail" Dauterive.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.089
Remember you asked if anyone would notice

19:34.173 --> 19:35.257
if you didn't go to work?

19:35.340 --> 19:36.717
Well, the Army sure noticed.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.553
If you don't get back to cut
the General's hair, you're AWOL.

19:39.636 --> 19:42.598
The Army is gonna lock you up
for 30 years.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.766
You know how much that's gonna cost them?

19:44.850 --> 19:46.768
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.478
I'd say that's taking notice.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.064
But the Harmonaholics are my friends.

19:51.148 --> 19:52.149
Are they really?

19:52.232 --> 19:55.068
All they've asked from you
is to give, give, give.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.987
Well, friendship is a two-way street.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.363
Heck, you know we gave up

19:58.447 --> 20:00.949
Monday Night Football tickets
to come get you?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.034
That's a friend.

20:02.117 --> 20:03.285
Not these guys.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.130
You're right, Hank.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.007
I gotta get back to the general.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.175
Let's move.

20:21.428 --> 20:22.262
William?

20:22.346 --> 20:23.347
William!

20:24.014 --> 20:26.308
You. How'd you like to be a star?

20:27.643 --> 20:28.894
Where's Sergeant Dauterive?

20:32.856 --> 20:34.900
General.

20:34.983 --> 20:36.360
Would you like to...

20:36.443 --> 20:38.362
to have... a seat?

20:38.445 --> 20:41.198
You know, you're the only Army barber
I let touch my hair.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.034
Thank you, sir.

20:44.117 --> 20:46.036
I always say the 110th
has the best barber.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.996
We fight hard and we look good doing it.

21:00.008 --> 21:02.094
Well, we missed the Cowboys,

21:02.177 --> 21:03.595
but we bailed Bill out.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.932
Oh, sorry, I guess you're
in the middle of your game.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.727
