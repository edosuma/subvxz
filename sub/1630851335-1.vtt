00:05.881 --> 00:08.843
"Drawings from 30,000 years ago

00:08.926 --> 00:12.888
in which people use erotic toys
for sexual pleasure have been found.

00:12.972 --> 00:16.684
This shows that sex toys
were invented long before the wheel."

00:31.323 --> 00:32.366
Óscar?

00:32.533 --> 00:35.035
You took my toothbrush again, honey.

00:35.286 --> 00:36.370
Sorry.

00:38.998 --> 00:41.167
I hope you start using yours, honey.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.126
Mmh.

00:42.334 --> 00:44.587
That's what they are made for.
I love it.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.381
You should shave that beard.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.091
What? You don't like it?

00:50.217 --> 00:53.929
I thought I'd grow
a long, long, Viking beard.

00:55.139 --> 00:56.807
Can't you take anything seriously?

00:58.601 --> 00:59.810
If you don't shave,

00:59.894 --> 01:02.605
then I won't shave my legs
for a long time.

01:07.818 --> 01:11.405
- You won't? I'll help you...
- Óscar, stop! Please!

01:12.490 --> 01:15.576
Hey, give me that back!
What are you doing?

01:15.785 --> 01:17.703
Enough! That's enough!

01:18.287 --> 01:19.955
He started it!

01:20.039 --> 01:22.249
- Come on, boys!
- I don't care who started it!

01:22.333 --> 01:25.461
- I don't care!
- Please, listen to your mother.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.422
You're of great help, comrade.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.968
You know what?
I really need a full-time nanny.

01:33.052 --> 01:35.179
Babysitting is a form
of modern slavery

01:35.262 --> 01:38.015
caused by capitalist exploitation,
Bárbara.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.393
Why should we need a housemaid?

01:41.477 --> 01:43.854
You are exploiting me for free.

01:45.815 --> 01:48.943
Please verify that your cell phones
are switched off.

01:49.318 --> 01:52.530
We remind you that its use
is now prohibited.

01:52.863 --> 01:53.948
Thanks.

02:13.092 --> 02:14.510
Just give me a second.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.272
Does little Óscar want
to come out and play?

02:30.568 --> 02:32.361
Not tonight, honey.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.698
It was a long day.

02:37.241 --> 02:38.492
Come on.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.996
I spent all day thinking about you
and all we could do.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.542
Guess what I want you to do to me?

03:06.562 --> 03:07.813
Shit!

03:09.189 --> 03:10.608
I can't sleep.

03:21.744 --> 03:24.455
Babe, my jaw is getting numb!

03:24.538 --> 03:26.749
Lend me a hand here, come on.

03:26.832 --> 03:29.460
I know. I'm sorry.
I'm kind of absent-minded.

03:30.294 --> 03:31.879
I'm sorry. Mmh.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.256
I visited my naturopath friend.

03:34.965 --> 03:37.509
She mentioned that ginseng
and pomegranate juice

03:37.593 --> 03:38.761
is good for this...

03:40.804 --> 03:43.933
Okay. Then let's drink
pomegranate and ginseng juice.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.769
- Come on. Keep going.
- Mom, I want to pee!

03:46.894 --> 03:48.646
Oops! Too late.

04:04.787 --> 04:07.539
Excuse me, sir.
You need to go back to your seat.

04:08.332 --> 04:09.667
Just a minute, please.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.710
Now, sir.
We're about to land.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.895
THE GAME OF KEYS

04:35.442 --> 04:37.486
On days like this,
I'd love to be you, hon.

04:37.736 --> 04:38.612
Why?

04:38.654 --> 04:41.365
I'd rather be traveling
and planning weddings than...

04:43.617 --> 04:44.910
It's not that simple.

04:44.994 --> 04:47.496
To be honest,
traveling is so stressful.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.333
Have I already packed...?

04:52.418 --> 04:53.877
My toothbrush.

05:01.427 --> 05:04.972
I finally got the DJ's confirmation.
Soundcheck is at 4:00 p.m.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.057
Please, tell him he should start
with "Para tu Amor."

05:07.141 --> 05:08.392
That's what the couple requested.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.770
- I'll remind him.
- Look at them! Sweet!

05:12.980 --> 05:17.401
They don't even stop for air...
How do they do it?

05:18.235 --> 05:19.486
Adriana?

05:20.195 --> 05:23.365
- Sergio?
- I can't fucking believe it!

05:24.450 --> 05:26.702
Weren't you in the States?

05:26.785 --> 05:29.204
I was. But I got bored
and now I'm back home.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.000
This is Siena, my girlfriend.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.668
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

05:35.127 --> 05:37.463
- She's Bárbara, my business partner.
- Hi.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.591
- Adri, we need to go.
- I know.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.009
Are you still seeing Óscar?

05:42.760 --> 05:44.261
- Great.
- Come on, Adri.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.972
We should hang out some day.
I'll be here in Mexico.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.391
- I'll give you my card...
- Adri, please.

05:49.475 --> 05:50.601
I'm coming.

05:50.768 --> 05:54.188
Here. You can call me anytime.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.066
Bring Óscar and everyone else,
including your partner.

05:57.399 --> 06:00.360
I will. Text me.
We'll arrange something.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.237
Okay.

06:02.988 --> 06:03.947
Sergio?

06:06.742 --> 06:09.661
- Who's that cute guy?
- An old friend from school.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.414
Boys in your school were hotter
than the ones in mine.

06:12.498 --> 06:13.540
I wouldn't say that.

06:13.624 --> 06:16.960
But he was one of the hottest.
He had a new girlfriend every week.

06:17.086 --> 06:18.879
He seemed happy to see you again.

06:19.588 --> 06:22.257
We were good friends.
He felt like he could open up to me.

06:22.466 --> 06:25.219
- And you wouldn't open up to him?
- Bárbara!

06:25.385 --> 06:28.806
- "Open up to me, Adri."
- Stop it! It's so embarrassing.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.432
- This way.
- Which way?

06:30.516 --> 06:32.684
This way. Hurry, we're late!

06:40.526 --> 06:42.152
Therefore what God
has joined together,

06:42.694 --> 06:43.821
let no one separate.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.447
Rings, please.

06:45.531 --> 06:47.449
I can really get emotional
with all this.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.660
So much love is overwhelming.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.497
- We did a hell of a job, didn't we?
- We did.

06:54.373 --> 06:55.833
I love my job!

06:57.084 --> 06:59.128
You may kiss the bride.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.588
Hurrah to the bride and groom!

07:05.884 --> 07:08.345
I'LL SEE YOU ALL
AT MY PLACE ON THURSDAY.

07:08.554 --> 07:11.348
I'LL LET THEM KNOW.
SEE YOU.

07:13.016 --> 07:15.435
Are you sure
you don't want something stronger?

07:15.519 --> 07:18.981
No, dear. I'm fine.
I want to keep my mind sharp.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.819
My friend Sergio texted me.

07:23.861 --> 07:27.322
He's inviting us for dinner
on Thursday. Save the date.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.617
- Why me?
- Please, come with me.

07:30.701 --> 07:33.120
Óscar hates those parties.

07:33.996 --> 07:35.539
Okay, I'm in.

07:35.914 --> 07:39.376
It's a good excuse
to get rid of the kids for a while.

07:39.585 --> 07:40.544
- I know.
- Cheers!

07:41.753 --> 07:43.213
Cheers to the bride and groom!

07:47.968 --> 07:51.096
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!

07:55.517 --> 07:57.561
- Don't you miss it?
- What?

07:58.437 --> 08:01.023
All that romance?

08:02.524 --> 08:04.568
I thought you and Óscar were happy.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.696
Yes, we are happy. Sure.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.991
I couldn't have found
a better husband and dad for Mica.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.952
It's just that sometimes...

08:14.369 --> 08:16.538
I wish he wasn't so obsessed

08:16.622 --> 08:18.957
with being so him all the time.

08:19.791 --> 08:20.876
You know?

08:21.627 --> 08:23.879
When Leo and I moved in together...

08:25.130 --> 08:28.634
I had an orgasm
just listening to his voice.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.888
Óscar was all over me all day
when we were at school.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.766
Then we got married, and he stopped.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.358
It's a coincidence that we bumped
into Sergio Morales earlier.

08:44.608 --> 08:46.443
Are you sure you didn't like him?

08:47.319 --> 08:50.572
Of course I liked him!
All the girls liked him!

08:50.948 --> 08:54.076
But just as friends.
We had nothing in common.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.912
We would've never worked together.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.081
Why are you bringing him up?

09:01.541 --> 09:04.336
I didn't. You brought him up.

09:04.711 --> 09:05.545
Did I?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.881
Well, maybe I did.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.223
Have you ever fantasized
about being unfaithful?

09:17.391 --> 09:18.600
No.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.395
I haven't. I wouldn't cheat on Óscar.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.272
That's your destiny.

09:24.731 --> 09:29.111
Too horny for a wife,
too faithful for a slut.

09:30.404 --> 09:33.907
I'll have those words tattooed
on my ass.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.701
Great!

09:36.285 --> 09:38.829
Have a drink with me.
Gabriel, give us a tequila.

09:39.705 --> 09:40.998
I'll drink it, then.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.249
Come on.

09:42.791 --> 09:43.917
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

09:53.552 --> 09:56.138
- Hi, honey!
- Hi, there.

09:57.764 --> 10:01.476
The wedding was great.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.562
Everything came out perfect.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.402
It didn't rain,
although it was forecasted.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.821
It was supposed to be pouring.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.866
- How did things go for you?
- Good!

10:20.203 --> 10:21.580
God, what a mess!

10:26.835 --> 10:28.920
Shoot now. Just shoot! Run now!

10:30.756 --> 10:33.633
- Just run, guys. Hurry.
- Want an orange?

10:33.842 --> 10:35.010
Yes.

10:35.302 --> 10:39.014
Guys, please. Go to your right.
We'll attack from there.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.309
Shoot! Run now!

10:45.645 --> 10:48.482
Mom! You scared the hell out of me!

10:48.648 --> 10:50.650
You scared me to death.
Why did you do that?

10:50.817 --> 10:52.861
What did I do?
We were chatting.

10:53.945 --> 10:56.698
-You scared me to death.
- Didn't you want an orange?

10:57.783 --> 10:58.784
No.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.954
I'm back, guys.

11:03.246 --> 11:06.249
- Mica, have you seen...?
- Dad! I reached the Heroic level.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.002
I swear.
I just need to kill one guy.

11:09.044 --> 11:10.337
- Really?
- Really.

11:11.254 --> 11:12.255
Watch!

11:13.340 --> 11:14.591
"Hello!

11:15.008 --> 11:17.469
Welcome home.
How was your flight?

11:17.552 --> 11:19.179
And the wedding?"

11:20.722 --> 11:21.932
I missed you.

11:22.808 --> 11:25.894
- I was gone only two days.
- But I missed you.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.816
The house isn't the same without you.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.819
I feel sad when you are away.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.155
Listen.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.950
Guess who we ran into at the airport.

11:40.409 --> 11:43.412
- Who?
- Sergio Morales.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.996
From school?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.208
I remember him.

11:48.875 --> 11:54.047
I thought he was in the States,
working as an extra, right?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.217
As Ryan Gosling's double?

11:57.592 --> 11:59.052
Yeah. But he's back home.

11:59.845 --> 12:02.848
He invited us for dinner...
on Thursday?

12:04.141 --> 12:05.392
I don't feel like it.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.811
We're not going, are we?

12:10.772 --> 12:12.399
- Look.
- Why not?

12:12.566 --> 12:13.650
Well...

12:14.609 --> 12:16.236
It could be fun.

12:18.155 --> 12:21.950
I know Sergio was
kind of an asshole, but...

12:22.033 --> 12:24.494
- Kind of?
- Everybody is invited.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.748
It might be nice
to do something new.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.419
Mica, help me here.

12:33.712 --> 12:36.131
I'm dying, help me.

12:36.214 --> 12:38.049
Everyone's going
with their spouses,

12:38.133 --> 12:40.093
and I'll be alone
if you're not coming.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.847
Or I can stay home, if you want.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.100
Jesus!

12:48.477 --> 12:50.145
Okay, we're going.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.482
Just a couple of hours.
It's not like I want you to miss it.

12:54.316 --> 12:55.442
I love you!

12:55.775 --> 12:57.652
Mom, that's so gross!

12:58.945 --> 13:01.281
Weren't you supposed
to be killing dragons?

13:02.282 --> 13:04.743
They're soul-eating giants,
and I've already killed them all.

13:05.327 --> 13:09.706
I'm trying to be a super cool mom,
but it isn't working at all.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.459
You need to be more patient.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.462
Oh, my God!

13:16.963 --> 13:18.632
Just be patient.

13:19.049 --> 13:22.052
Mica has the soul of an artist,
just like me.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.555
But Óscar doesn't have
a hint of artistic genius

13:25.639 --> 13:27.140
and they get along a lot better.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.518
It's like having
two teenagers at home.

13:29.601 --> 13:32.145
Men never grow up.

13:33.188 --> 13:36.358
By the way, I forgot
to tell you that I ran into...

13:38.235 --> 13:39.778
Sergio Morales at the airport.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.156
- Sergio from school?
- That's right.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.243
- Wasn't he Tom Cruise's guru?
- I don't know.

13:46.284 --> 13:49.829
He was making out with his girlfriend
Vienna, Siena, whatever.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.373
She's named after an Italian village.

13:51.456 --> 13:52.874
- And is he still cute?
- Well...

13:53.250 --> 13:55.669
You'll see him on Thursday,
he invited us for dinner.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.754
I can't. We're attending a concert.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.756
Come on, Gaby! You must come.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.384
It's a school reunion.
You can't miss it.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.386
Wait.

14:04.553 --> 14:07.138
- What are you laughing at?
- I've just remembered...

14:07.889 --> 14:10.976
Remember when you found out
Sergio liked Nicole Kidman

14:11.059 --> 14:12.978
and you dyed your hair red?

14:13.311 --> 14:16.523
I just got some red highlights.
And they looked great on me.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.358
You even had curls on your hair.

14:18.483 --> 14:22.529
I want you to come and meet
his girlfriend who's like Megan Fox,

14:22.612 --> 14:24.447
nothing to do with Nicole Kidman.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.324
I'm just curious now.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.244
I'll try to persuade Valentín,
but you know him.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.842
- Hi, there!
- Hi, honey!

14:44.092 --> 14:45.260
Hello, darling.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.554
How are you?
Oh, hello, baby girl!

14:48.138 --> 14:50.765
What's up, my baby girl?

14:51.266 --> 14:52.434
Hey.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.395
- How was your day?
- Fine.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.356
I trained with Adriana
and came back to work.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.568
How was your work out/gossip session?

15:01.943 --> 15:04.446
- It was a gossip session indeed.
- Really?

15:04.654 --> 15:07.532
Adriana bumped into
her old high school crush.

15:08.199 --> 15:11.328
He was at school with us
and then went on to travel the world.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.831
- Maybe you know him.
- Who's that guy?

15:15.290 --> 15:18.627
He invited us for dinner at his place
on Thursday, and I said yes.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.963
- Shall we go?
- It's Schubert's piano concert.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.257
- Fuck! I forgot.
- You did?

15:24.341 --> 15:25.508
I did.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.177
And I said yes.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.721
It's okay.
I'll tell Adriana we can't go.

15:29.804 --> 15:32.599
It would've been fun, though.
It's been years since we last met.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.770
- What?
- You win. Come here!

15:38.647 --> 15:41.941
We'll hang out with your friends
and go to the concert some other day.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.110
- Are you sure?
- Is that okay with you?

15:44.194 --> 15:45.737
It is. I love you.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.156
- Do you feel like dinner?
- Dinner?

15:48.239 --> 15:50.950
Yes. Open a bottle of wine.
I'll be with you in a minute.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.661
Come on, girl.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.496
Let's have dinner.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.627
- Leave my brother alone!
- Put that bow down!

16:00.710 --> 16:03.380
- Leave him alone!
- You're going to get hurt!

16:03.546 --> 16:05.590
- I can't smell your cologne.
- No. I'm fine.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.634
- Did you wear your cologne?
- I did.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.305
God!

16:12.389 --> 16:14.849
Bárbara, come on. Let's go.

16:14.933 --> 16:18.978
Come here.
Stop throwing stuff at each other.

16:19.938 --> 16:24.984
Listen. I have lemon popsicles.
If you behave, you can have one.

16:25.694 --> 16:26.903
Are you sure?

16:32.117 --> 16:33.535
Do you hear that?

16:33.910 --> 16:35.620
It's complete silence.

16:35.995 --> 16:40.250
I don't care what you think.
We're getting a full-time nanny.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.628
Bárbara, you know
how I feel about that.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.340
Leo, I love you. But I'm not happy.

16:47.632 --> 16:48.925
And this has to change.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.261
Either we get a full-time nanny,

16:51.469 --> 16:53.638
or I swear I'll leave you alone
with the kids.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.563
What do you think?

17:03.356 --> 17:04.774
Adriana is here.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.695
It's funny that she's always driving.

17:10.238 --> 17:13.575
- Óscar can't drive or what?
- He can.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.703
- Hey!
- Hi.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.915
We all arrived at the same time.
We are in sync.

17:21.124 --> 17:23.793
- Couldn't have come out better.
- We all arrived at the same time.

17:24.753 --> 17:26.463
- What did you get?
- Some pasta.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.923
- Yummy! That's a cake?
- No. It's a sculpture.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.842
- Hi, Barbs.
- How are you?

17:30.925 --> 17:32.260
- Hey!
- Gaby.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.971
- Hi, Leo.
- Hi, Barbs. How are you?

17:35.388 --> 17:36.681
Did she make it?

17:36.765 --> 17:38.183
-Hello, guys. Welcome.

17:38.975 --> 17:39.809
How is it going?

17:39.893 --> 17:42.312
How's it going, Morales?
You haven't changed, buddy!

17:42.437 --> 17:44.397
You too, man! How are doing?

17:44.439 --> 17:47.817
Well, you're kind of chubby now.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.488
Hi. Nice to see you again.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.574
- Adriana, you look beautiful.
- Thanks.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.868
- Do you remember Gaby?
- Sure.

17:56.951 --> 17:58.745
- Hi! It's been a long time!
- I know.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.539
- This is my husband, Valentín.
- Nice to meet you.

18:01.623 --> 18:04.501
- You too. Associate. How are you?
- Hi.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.212
- This is Leo, my husband.
- Hi.

18:07.712 --> 18:10.298
Nice to meet you.
Thank you for having us over.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.259
Thank you for coming.
Come in, please.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.011
Thanks.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.971
Leave my wife's salad alone.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.308
- It's pasta.
- It's Christmas salad.

18:24.354 --> 18:27.023
You must throw
some really good parties here.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.359
Just like today, right?

18:31.319 --> 18:32.737
It's so nice in here.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.948
Hello! Welcome.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.574
- Hi.
- Mezcal anybody?

18:37.033 --> 18:39.702
- Yes, please.
- This is Siena, my girlfriend.

18:40.245 --> 18:42.747
They are Bárbara, Leo,
Gaby, Valentín,

18:42.789 --> 18:44.499
Adriana, and Óscar.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.670
- Okay. Just to warm up.
- Cheers!

18:49.003 --> 18:50.296
Cheers.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.174
- Where is mine?
- Right here, babe.

18:58.346 --> 19:01.099
- You have a nice apartment.
- Thanks.

19:01.766 --> 19:04.936
It's actually a friend's.
He's in New York and let us stay.

19:05.061 --> 19:08.481
- But yes, it's incredible.
- Until we find our own place.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.108
But it's okay.

19:10.191 --> 19:12.277
Let's go to the kitchen.
Make yourselves at home.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.279
Are you okay?

19:14.404 --> 19:17.490
This is for you.
It's fresh from the oven.

19:17.574 --> 19:20.285
For me? It's a chocolate cake...

19:20.368 --> 19:21.661
Not exactly.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.331
- My God!
- It's based...

19:25.957 --> 19:28.376
on old Peruvian fertility sculptures.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.295
- I hope you like it.
- It's great.

19:30.378 --> 19:34.173
Gaby is a unique sculptor,
but she's really good.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.384
- You made it?
- Yes, I did.

19:36.718 --> 19:39.095
My followers are going to love this.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.264
Siena, please, give them a break.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.600
Please, come here.
Let's start drinking.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.603
I need to take a picture of this now!

19:48.229 --> 19:50.356
Your skills have improved a lot.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.608
Look at that!

19:52.692 --> 19:56.195
Óscar, can you hand me
the wine bottle I left on the bar?

19:56.738 --> 19:58.072
The boss has spoken.

19:59.407 --> 20:00.658
Thank you.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.660
Some pasta.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.621
Thank you.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.960
It's delicious.
I'll put them over here.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.257
- Have a tequila with me.
- No. I'm fine with wine.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.092
Really, I'm fine. I'll be back.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.053
What are you doing?

20:20.303 --> 20:22.513
- Don't you remember?
- What?

20:22.597 --> 20:23.806
Right!

20:27.060 --> 20:29.270
I love my sweetheart's ass!

20:29.812 --> 20:31.105
Hi there, babe.

20:31.856 --> 20:33.816
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.029
Behave yourself!

20:38.488 --> 20:40.740
- It's so hard for me.
- Sure, I liked it.

20:40.823 --> 20:43.284
Hey, man! Some mezcal for you.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.871
- There you are!
- Cheers.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.666
Adriana got really drunk that day.

20:50.959 --> 20:53.878
You even puked.
But I took care of you.

20:53.962 --> 20:56.839
...like this delicious wine
my comrade brought.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.133
- It's been a long time.
- It's so cool.

20:59.968 --> 21:02.720
Who wants some wine?

21:06.391 --> 21:10.353
Remember that drink they served
at the club we used to go to?

21:12.522 --> 21:13.940
Okay, enough!

21:14.023 --> 21:17.860
Enough of your school experiences
that I don't fucking understand.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.112
Please!

21:19.654 --> 21:23.157
Let's play a game! Valentín, hand me
those cups behind you, please.

21:24.367 --> 21:25.785
What kind of game?

21:26.494 --> 21:27.787
What kind of game?

21:28.079 --> 21:29.872
- "Never Have I Ever."
- How do you play it?

21:30.039 --> 21:31.457
What do you mean?

21:31.666 --> 21:32.792
In his school days,

21:32.875 --> 21:35.712
Valentín used
to play Monopoly with real houses.

21:36.421 --> 21:40.383
- Shut up, you communist.
- It's not that difficult.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.969
When it's your turn, you say,
"Never have I ever whatever..."

21:43.136 --> 21:45.221
Whoever answers yes gets a shot.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.766
- Okay. I'll go first.
- Great.

21:49.809 --> 21:53.479
So, never have I ever...

21:54.230 --> 21:55.773
been to Acapulco.

21:59.444 --> 22:02.363
What you meant was,
"Never have I ever ...

22:02.905 --> 22:05.116
- had sex with a donkey in Acapulco."
- Right!

22:07.660 --> 22:10.747
Well, you know my secret now.
Cheers!

22:11.706 --> 22:14.167
Disgusting! You haven't changed.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.711
The donkey's name was Patrick
and was a nice guy.

22:19.714 --> 22:21.799
Come on, now. It's my turn.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.763
Not including
your current partners...

22:28.514 --> 22:33.019
never have I ever dreamt about
having sex with someone in this room.

22:38.566 --> 22:41.110
I have to admit
this sexual fantasy...

22:42.153 --> 22:44.614
came up specifically
during this last hour.

22:44.739 --> 22:47.575
- Cheers, comrade Siena.
- Cheers, comrade.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.243
Excellent, Leo.

22:50.745 --> 22:54.040
Then, let's take this game
to the next level.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.375
Why don't we play...

22:57.043 --> 22:58.419
"The Game of Keys"?

22:59.170 --> 23:01.297
Wait, Siena. They are not like that.

23:01.547 --> 23:02.715
They are.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.467
Like what?

23:04.592 --> 23:07.428
- We are like that.
- We are certainly like that.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.306
- Like what?
- We are like that!

23:10.389 --> 23:11.891
It depends...

23:12.558 --> 23:14.811
We are like that!

23:14.894 --> 23:17.605
- Óscar!
- We are like that.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.440
Okay, then.

23:20.149 --> 23:23.653
Ladies, take out your keys
and throw them into this bowl.

23:24.237 --> 23:26.781
Your car keys, your home keys,
any key.

23:29.492 --> 23:32.036
Now, gentlemen,
you're going to close your eyes

23:32.245 --> 23:33.955
and pick a random key.

23:34.789 --> 23:35.873
I go first!

23:47.343 --> 23:48.719
Okay. Good.

23:48.803 --> 23:50.888
- What's next?
- Now...

23:52.056 --> 23:55.810
You're going to sit next to the owner
of the keys you're holding.

23:56.686 --> 23:58.563
Whose are these?

23:58.855 --> 24:00.857
- That's mine.
- Those are mine.

24:02.483 --> 24:05.194
- We're going to win this game!
- Come here.

24:05.278 --> 24:07.405
I got the smartest guy in the room.

24:10.199 --> 24:12.326
- What's next?
- Okay, perfect.

24:14.912 --> 24:18.040
We're going to have sex all night...

24:18.708 --> 24:20.751
with the key owner.

24:41.147 --> 24:44.775
- You're kidding, right?
- I'm not, dear.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.485
- She is.
- I'm not.

24:48.029 --> 24:49.488
No way!
