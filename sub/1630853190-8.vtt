WEBVTT

00:04.605 --> 00:06.374
Why do so many shows
start with people

00:06.474 --> 00:07.908
sitting on the couch talking?

00:08.008 --> 00:10.611
I think it's just a nice way
to ease into the episode.

00:12.813 --> 00:17.185
Presenting the greatest manager
of all time!

00:17.285 --> 00:19.920
(imitating fanfare)

00:22.990 --> 00:25.526
Man, do you know
how to enter a room.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.729
Team, besties, familia,

00:28.829 --> 00:30.764
could I ask you
a serious question?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.533
When you woke up this morning,

00:32.633 --> 00:34.335
did you think it was just
gonna be like an ordinary day,

00:34.435 --> 00:35.769
or did you think
you would get news

00:35.869 --> 00:38.239
that would change
your life forever?

00:38.339 --> 00:42.510
Ordinary day, but I feel like
I was dead stupid wrong.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.414
- You tell me.
- Oh, my God, Paul!

00:46.514 --> 00:47.715
- Yeah.
- (gasps)

00:47.815 --> 00:50.384
This can only mean
one of two things.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.120
Either I'm pregnant
and didn't know it,

00:52.220 --> 00:54.155
but somehow you do, and felt
this was an appropriate way

00:54.255 --> 00:56.357
to reveal that, or...

00:56.457 --> 01:00.060
I'm gonna be the next
USA Bae Doll.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.463
(both shouting)

01:02.563 --> 01:05.032
(all cheering)

01:05.133 --> 01:07.901
You have been selected
as a USA Bae of Todae,

01:08.001 --> 01:10.171
celebrating strong,
empowering people

01:10.271 --> 01:11.339
from around the country.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.374
Ha!
Oh, just to be clear,

01:13.474 --> 01:15.008
I'm not pregnant, right?

01:15.109 --> 01:16.744
- No.
- Whatever.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.679
I'm gonna be a doll, bitches!

01:18.779 --> 01:20.314
Yeah!

01:20.414 --> 01:22.216
* I know you see *

01:22.316 --> 01:24.818
* Somehow the world
will change for me *

01:24.918 --> 01:28.055
* And be so wonderful *

01:28.156 --> 01:32.426
* So wake up the members
of my nation *

01:32.526 --> 01:34.094
* It's your time to be *

01:34.195 --> 01:36.864
* There's no chance
unless you take one *

01:36.964 --> 01:39.633
* And the time to see
the brighter side *

01:39.733 --> 01:42.903
* Of every situation *

01:43.003 --> 01:44.938
* Some things
are meant to be *

01:45.038 --> 01:48.542
* So give me your best
and leave the rest to me **

01:55.416 --> 01:56.850
Come on, open her up!

01:56.950 --> 01:59.086
Aw, Millicent, you're even
more anxious than I am.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.754
Relax. I need the box.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.123
I have to make a diorama
for school.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.458
What are we waiting for?

02:04.558 --> 02:06.227
Pearl.
I texted to see if she's close.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.695
She hasn't replied yet.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.397
I'd text again,
but I don't wanna double-text.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.565
Or, I guess technically,
it'd be...

02:12.433 --> 02:14.067
...fourteen-uple text.

02:14.168 --> 02:18.472
I wonder what profound things
my Bae is gonna have to say.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.175
I remember
my first USA Bae, Gemma.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.643
She would say things like...

02:22.743 --> 02:24.178
(with British accent):
"Girl power!"

02:24.278 --> 02:26.247
And "London calling!"

02:26.347 --> 02:27.748
She was from Nebraska,

02:27.848 --> 02:29.417
but she went to England
for a couple weeks

02:29.517 --> 02:30.951
and it became
her whole personality.

02:31.051 --> 02:33.354
- (phone dings)
- Pearl said, "Having fun

02:33.454 --> 02:35.155
"with the girls,
so I'm gonna stay here.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.390
- Tell Carly..."
- Ahh!

02:36.490 --> 02:38.559
Don't wreck the box!

02:38.659 --> 02:40.728
(Carly exclaiming)

02:43.364 --> 02:44.665
Oh.

02:47.701 --> 02:51.004
She's great.
She's got huge... personality.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.506
Yeah.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.642
Two of 'em.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.310
Hello, beautiful.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.145
Spencer, it's me.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.649
You're not that top-heavy.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.152
Maybe she needs bigger feet.

03:05.253 --> 03:08.155
Nothing needs to be bigger.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.057
"Collect all five Baes.

03:10.157 --> 03:12.693
"The Marine Biologist,
the Horror Novelist,

03:12.793 --> 03:16.864
"the Neonatologist,
the Soccer Star, and...

03:17.665 --> 03:19.066
...the Hot One."

03:20.434 --> 03:21.935
I'm the Hot One?

03:22.035 --> 03:24.405
Carly, don't make
snap judgments.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.073
Just because someone
is beautiful

03:26.173 --> 03:27.841
doesn't mean
they're not a role model.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.511
Emily Ratajkowski
wrote a book.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.214
"Meet Carly Shay,
super sexy influencer

03:34.315 --> 03:38.151
who isn't afraid to turn
a profit by turning heads."

03:40.854 --> 03:43.757
DOLL (Carly's voice):
Likes give me purpose.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.826
She doesn't sound
anything like me.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.795
Yeah.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.431
Selfies, or it didn't happen.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.899
I'm sorry,
what'd you say, Carly?

03:51.999 --> 03:55.603
"Accessories include
hand mirror,

03:55.703 --> 03:58.439
"cell phone,
and second cell phone

03:58.539 --> 04:00.574
with a ring light attached."

04:00.674 --> 04:02.610
"Botox sold separately."

04:02.710 --> 04:05.212
Okay, we still have time
to work on it, right?

04:05.313 --> 04:07.748
I will call corporate
first thing tomorrow.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.017
I don't have female friends,

04:10.117 --> 04:13.253
'cause women
are too jealous of me.

04:15.323 --> 04:18.692
I'm gonna call 'em right now.
Right now!

04:20.294 --> 04:23.464
Huh, well, the three ball's
probably the easier shot.

04:23.564 --> 04:24.965
Three is Pearl's lucky number.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.700
But then the 11 could
set me up to run the table

04:26.800 --> 04:28.235
and Pearl is the youngest
of 11 children...

04:28.336 --> 04:30.704
Just hit the damn ball!

04:31.772 --> 04:34.041
Sorry.
So, you miss Pearl, huh?

04:34.141 --> 04:36.243
(scoffs)
Is it that obvious?

04:36.344 --> 04:38.011
No, I'm just more perceptive
than most.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.880
Picking up
on little clues here and there.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.415
I'm like that guy,
what's his name,

04:41.515 --> 04:43.451
with the magnifying glass
and the Sherlock Holmes hat.

04:43.551 --> 04:44.885
Carmen Sandiego.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.721
Truth is, I'm starting to worry

04:47.821 --> 04:49.289
that Pearl might be
losing interest in me.

04:49.390 --> 04:52.092
Say no more.
I'm on it.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.561
- Uh, no, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, don't worry.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.463
I got a guy.
His name is Sully.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.665
He's real smart
and real tough.

04:57.765 --> 05:01.301
He makes sons of bitches
look like real bastards.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.705
That sounds bad.
Do not have him come here.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.174
(phone chimes)

05:07.274 --> 05:09.109
Oh, too late, he's in.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.178
He's just gotta hop on
a flight from Barbados.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.980
Oh, you know who's been
to Barbados?

05:13.080 --> 05:14.482
- Oh, Pearl?
- Yeah.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.849
No one cares.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.694
HARPER:
Wow!

05:27.661 --> 05:29.730
This place is so inclusive.

05:29.830 --> 05:33.200
A bae for every bae,
as long as you're rich.

05:36.404 --> 05:39.773
Harper, Carly,
this is my niece, Rose.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.775
She's named after that plant
from The Bachelor.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.912
- Hi!
- Aw! Hi, there, Rose.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.649
Rose is a big fan of yours,
Carly, and the USA Bae dolls.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.385
And James Corden.
She's a night owl.

05:51.485 --> 05:54.254
Well, then you can be
our special expert

05:54.354 --> 05:57.425
on how to make my doll
less offensive and terrible.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.626
Okay!

05:58.726 --> 06:00.227
(chuckles)

06:00.327 --> 06:04.097
I know these are for dolls,
but I could pull this off.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.401
Oh, definitely.
I'm Byron.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.470
Harper.
Tell me,

06:09.570 --> 06:13.173
is there a Mrs. Handsome Man
With a Perfect Smile?

06:13.273 --> 06:16.276
- There's not.
- Ooh, lucky me.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.480
There he is,
Twinkle Dream Weaver

06:19.580 --> 06:21.281
and Chief Am-bae-ssador
himself!

06:21.381 --> 06:22.683
Hold on, Carly.

06:22.783 --> 06:26.086
You don't think this man
works in a doll store?

06:26.186 --> 06:27.354
(laughs) No.

06:27.455 --> 06:28.756
I actually don't know what
he does yet,

06:28.856 --> 06:30.390
but in my mind,
he builds furniture,

06:30.491 --> 06:32.793
rescues kittens, but where
he really makes his money

06:32.893 --> 06:35.362
is writing erotic poetry.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.865
- Am I close?
- I actually do work here.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.868
Which some closed-minded people
have a problem with.

06:40.968 --> 06:43.937
Oh, no, I am super open-minded!

06:44.037 --> 06:46.139
I'm like a 7-Eleven.
They're open a lot, right?

06:46.239 --> 06:48.742
- Mm-hmm.
- I love that you work here,

06:48.842 --> 06:50.343
because I'm not the type
of person who would have

06:50.444 --> 06:52.112
a problem with that--
not that I would have a problem

06:52.212 --> 06:53.614
with the type of person
who had a problem with that.

06:53.714 --> 06:54.715
Carly, you talk now.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.416
Why?
You're crushing it.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.751
(laughs)

06:57.851 --> 06:59.887
I'm Carly Shay,
we spoke on the phone.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.388
Oh, of course!

07:01.489 --> 07:04.291
I'm sorry, you just look
so different from your doll.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.727
Thank you.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.896
Why don't you and I exit
the judgment zone?

07:08.996 --> 07:12.065
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm super progressive!

07:12.165 --> 07:13.667
I'll give anyone a chance.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.736
I once dated
a puppeteer!

07:16.537 --> 07:18.639
The Carly Bae
should be a representation

07:18.739 --> 07:20.240
of me as a role model.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.175
She doesn't lead
with her looks.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.012
She should have
an understated grace.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.949
Yes, and smaller...
personality.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.684
Or at least bigger feet.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.386
Got it.
This is all super helpful.

07:33.487 --> 07:36.256
I promise, by launch day,
your doll will be much better.

07:36.356 --> 07:39.693
I really think my Bae
could be the best one ever.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.729
(uplifting music)

07:41.829 --> 07:44.197
(music distorts)

07:49.503 --> 07:52.072
DOLL (depressed tone):
I have lots of female friends

07:52.172 --> 07:54.508
who are also cats.

07:55.909 --> 07:59.780
Oh, good.
She's a feminist.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.858
I like her.
She's relatable.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.694
She has the eyes
of a hitchhiking ghost.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.597
Well, where's Rose?

08:16.697 --> 08:18.131
Why don't we ask her
what she thinks of her?

08:18.231 --> 08:20.100
Last time I saw her,
she was getting dental X-rays

08:20.200 --> 08:21.935
from Isla, the Orthodontist Bae.

08:22.035 --> 08:25.472
Look, that other doll
wasn't a role model.

08:25.573 --> 08:28.876
But this Carly could be.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.511
It's just important to me that
the focus isn't on her looks.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.582
Okay, but what--
what is the focus on?

08:34.682 --> 08:36.784
'Cause she literally looks
out of focus.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.653
I'm sorry.
If this is the doll you want,

08:39.753 --> 08:42.489
I do support you.
I just...

08:43.423 --> 08:45.559
Concerts are too loud.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.597
We're only given
one set of ears, Paul.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.302
Sully!

08:55.402 --> 08:57.204
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.538
You look good.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.641
Island life has been
treating you well.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.243
Now, the reason I asked you
to come here today

09:03.343 --> 09:07.514
is because my buddy Freddie
has been having girl trouble.

09:07.615 --> 09:08.982
I told you about Freddie, right?

09:09.082 --> 09:10.450
(chittering)

09:10.550 --> 09:13.053
Yeah, he smells a little
like cucumber salad, exactly.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.822
Anyway, here's the mark.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.223
This is Pearl.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.625
(chittering)

09:17.725 --> 09:19.292
I agree, she's a little
out of his league.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.329
But she and Freddie
have been drifting apart lately,

09:22.429 --> 09:24.665
and we gotta find a way
to reignite their passion.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.400
- (grunting)
- You smell cucumbers?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.703
- (door opens)
- Of course, there he is.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.640
I knew it was gonna be a monkey.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.341
SPENCER:
Freddie, have a seat.

09:34.441 --> 09:37.144
We gotta hammer out
this plan.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.445
And we gotta do it quickly.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.648
- Sully's jet-lagged.
- (chittering)

09:40.748 --> 09:42.415
I can't believe
I'm putting my relationship

09:42.515 --> 09:44.517
in the hands of you
and a monkey.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.954
A very cute monkey,
but still.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.255
Ah!

09:48.355 --> 09:49.890
Sorry, he doesn't like
being called cute.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.291
He thinks it
makes him seem weak.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.660
He weighs like six pounds!

09:52.760 --> 09:54.662
Yeah, but it's all muscle.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.730
Anyway, here's the play,
we're gonna do what we did

09:56.830 --> 09:58.031
for my buddy Victor
in Albuquerque.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.000
- What was that called?
- (grunting)

10:00.100 --> 10:02.736
That's right, the Flip Wilson.
We'll do that.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.672
Oh, no, you're right,

10:04.772 --> 10:06.173
we don't have a hotdog cart.
(grunts)

10:15.448 --> 10:17.417
- (chittering)
- What do you got?

10:17.517 --> 10:19.552
(chittering)

10:19.653 --> 10:21.254
Your diaper?
Yes, of course!

10:21.354 --> 10:23.256
We do the Baby Huey.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.692
The hell
is the Baby Huey?

10:24.792 --> 10:26.159
Well, it's right there
in the title.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.560
Sully pretends to be a baby,

10:27.661 --> 10:29.029
I drop him off
at your doorstep

10:29.129 --> 10:31.431
so you and Pearl
can take care of him.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.734
I read somewhere
that 90% of babies

10:33.834 --> 10:35.502
are born to save marriages.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.805
But 100% of those couples
break up.

10:37.905 --> 10:40.974
I didn't finish the article.
Anyway, you got a better idea?

10:41.074 --> 10:42.275
(sighs)

10:42.375 --> 10:44.978
Can't believe
I'm saying this... but no.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.513
Yeah!

10:46.613 --> 10:49.482
Yeah.
There you go.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.019
(chittering)

10:52.119 --> 10:53.787
Yeah.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.457
Now, remember,
when we see Byron,

10:57.557 --> 10:59.126
just like we practiced.

10:59.226 --> 11:02.996
Gee, lady, thanks for opening
my perspective!

11:03.096 --> 11:05.833
You're at an 11,
I need you at a six.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.870
Hello, child.
Bae I be of assistance?

11:09.970 --> 11:11.671
Byron, hi!

11:11.772 --> 11:13.941
I was just helping
this young person

11:14.041 --> 11:16.176
realize the importance
of not being so focused

11:16.276 --> 11:18.912
on the dolls' occupations.
(chuckles)

11:21.681 --> 11:23.450
Gee, lady, thanks for opening

11:23.550 --> 11:25.185
my perspective.

11:25.285 --> 11:28.756
Aw, run along, random youth.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.191
That was a three
and you know it.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.462
Byron, I'm sorry
for judging you.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.230
Honestly, it was
a split-second mistake

11:37.330 --> 11:38.932
and really unlike me.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.736
If you're still interested,
I'd love to get lunch sometime.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.271
- I'd like that.
- (sighs)

11:44.371 --> 11:45.873
How about later today
at the Caf-Bae?

11:45.973 --> 11:48.108
I get 20% off
pre-packaged snacks.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.543
You mean that area
filled with dolls

11:50.643 --> 11:52.145
being served food
they can't eat?

11:52.245 --> 11:54.681
Oh, is that
not fancy enough for you?

11:54.782 --> 11:56.616
What, should we go get lunch
at the bank?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.518
No, no, no,
the Caf-Bae is perfect.

11:58.618 --> 12:01.188
Ooh, Bae-tastic.
(laughing)

12:01.288 --> 12:03.390
Oh, just a heads-up,
the hummus tray

12:03.490 --> 12:04.792
doesn't count as pre-packaged.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.594
It's kind of a gray area,
but rules are rules.

12:09.262 --> 12:12.599
So, Rose,
you're the USA Bae expert.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.768
Yeah, I like them
'cause they're pretty.

12:14.868 --> 12:18.005
So, what do you think
about that one?

12:18.105 --> 12:20.073
She's not pretty.

12:21.274 --> 12:24.311
Wow, way to tear down
other women.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.080
Here, pull her string
and watch her come to life.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.384
(depressed tone):
It's fine.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.187
I'll eat it like this.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.655
She's relatable.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.724
- Her clothes don't fit.
- But she's smart.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.192
She looks tired.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.761
Well, we can't all take
two naps a day, Rose.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.197
Sorry.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.466
What I mean is,

12:46.566 --> 12:49.502
this doll can be whatever
you want her to be.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.805
Can she be...

12:51.905 --> 12:53.406
somewhere else?

12:54.407 --> 12:56.109
Go get fitted
for a night guard with Isla.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.945
Yay!

13:00.180 --> 13:03.083
Carly, good news has arrived
in the form of me.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.952
Oh, I could use some good news.

13:05.052 --> 13:07.921
And some money.
These waters were $42.

13:09.756 --> 13:14.161
Okay, so the prototype
wasn't a prototype.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.663
They mass-produced
the Hot Carly Bae

13:16.763 --> 13:18.598
and sent you one
assuming you'd love it.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.400
Apparently,
they've never had a Bae

13:20.500 --> 13:21.869
give negative feedback before.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.271
Great, so now
I'm not just the boring bae,

13:24.371 --> 13:27.574
I'm also the difficult bae.
I'm the Anne Hatha-bae.

13:27.674 --> 13:30.410
I know you, Carly.
You want a doll

13:30.510 --> 13:32.679
that those little kids
out there will cherish.

13:32.779 --> 13:35.082
So, I'm just presenting
your options.

13:35.182 --> 13:39.019
The first one,
or the boring one, you know?

13:39.119 --> 13:41.421
But I'll support
whichever you choose,

13:41.521 --> 13:43.790
even if it's the dead-eyed one
that no one would look at,

13:43.891 --> 13:45.392
let alone give to a child.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.728
All right,
let me get out of your hair

13:48.828 --> 13:50.097
so you can decide
which one to sell.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.932
The Hot One,
for instance.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.701
(fake coughing):
Do the Hot One!

13:54.801 --> 13:56.269
Sorry, allergies.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.110
(knocking)

14:03.210 --> 14:05.278
- Can you get the door?
- But you're right there.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.481
I know, but I just
put all this lotion

14:08.581 --> 14:10.683
on my hands, so, I can't...

14:13.220 --> 14:15.022
Okay.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.624
(gasps)

14:17.724 --> 14:19.726
- (gasps)
- Hi!

14:19.826 --> 14:22.662
Aw, what's that?

14:22.762 --> 14:24.397
(both chuckling)

14:25.198 --> 14:27.834
"My name is Sully.
I've been abandoned.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.402
"Looking for a really
committed couple

14:29.502 --> 14:31.571
"who's kind and generous,
and hasn't shared a meal

14:31.671 --> 14:33.073
in over a week."

14:33.173 --> 14:35.175
- Oh, my God.
- Aw!

14:35.275 --> 14:37.077
Someone just left him
on our doorstep.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.312
That is crazy.
Isn't that crazy?

14:39.412 --> 14:43.083
It's not crazy.
It's bananas.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.952
(laughing)

14:45.052 --> 14:47.254
Well, I think we should
keep him, the two of us.

14:47.354 --> 14:48.855
You know, it's a big
responsibility.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.057
We're gonna have to spend
a lot more time together

14:50.157 --> 14:51.358
at home, and not at work,

14:51.458 --> 14:53.793
or out getting drinks
with friends.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.729
Absolutely.
He needs us.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.531
Do you think he's hungry?

14:58.631 --> 15:00.133
Hey, you want
something to eat?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.434
(chittering)

15:01.534 --> 15:04.938
Oh, no, no, no.
That's Daddy's drink.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.274
- (both laughing)
- Okay.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.276
Give-- can...

15:09.376 --> 15:11.578
No, Sully, give the bottle
to Mommy.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.580
(chittering)

15:13.680 --> 15:15.415
(gasps)

15:15.515 --> 15:17.284
Oh, my God, he loves you.

15:17.384 --> 15:18.751
(whispering):
Spencer was right.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.954
You're the best there is.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.090
(gasps)

15:23.190 --> 15:24.491
- (laughing)
- Aw.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.959
Family hug.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.028
Sully, you're so cute.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.896
- Ow!
- (gasps) Sully!

15:29.997 --> 15:31.999
Stop it!
No, you get down.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.967
I don't know
what set him off.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.136
He doesn't like
to be called cute...

15:36.236 --> 15:38.038
- is my guess.
- Oh.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.173
I-I don't think it's safe for me

15:40.273 --> 15:41.541
to be in your apartment
with this monkey.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.310
- Let's just get rid of him.
- Oh, no, no.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.412
- We can't do that to him.
- (grunting)

15:45.512 --> 15:47.480
Okay, I-- I'll just leave.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.016
(stammering)

15:50.917 --> 15:52.252
- (door closes)
- You just wanna watch

15:52.352 --> 15:53.653
the world burn,
don't you, Sully?

15:53.753 --> 15:56.056
(chittering)

15:57.190 --> 15:59.692
Girls, this is a nightmare.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.561
What am I gonna do?

16:03.296 --> 16:06.366
(depressed tone):
Every flower is going to die.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.069
You know,
you're a real tough hang.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.006
Let's get va-jazzled!

16:13.106 --> 16:16.109
This is why you don't have
any female friends.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.646
Carly, there you are.
I need advice.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.448
Okay, but I need yours first.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.116
Those kids out there
are gonna eat me alive

16:23.216 --> 16:24.651
if I don't give 'em
one of these dolls.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.620
But how can I pick one
when they're both so wrong?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.456
Well, how could they be right?

16:29.556 --> 16:31.924
None of these people
really know you.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.793
They're just judging you
at the surface.

16:33.893 --> 16:36.963
Because...
that's what we all do.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.233
- So, what do I do?
- Shh, having an epiphany.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.403
So, Byron loves his job.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.737
So do I!

16:44.837 --> 16:47.340
So, it's very likely
he sleeps with a doll.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.476
(clicks tongue)
I can work with that.

16:49.576 --> 16:52.312
Thank you, Carly.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.480
Hey!

16:53.580 --> 16:55.315
What about my thing?

16:57.550 --> 16:59.586
Carly, you gotta make
a decision

16:59.686 --> 17:01.254
or we're gonna have
to call this whole thing off.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.656
We can do that?
Well, let's just do that!

17:03.756 --> 17:05.024
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.826
No, you'll owe them
a crap ton of money.

17:06.926 --> 17:09.196
Plus, I already spent my cut
on a Moroccan coffee table.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.898
It's on the boat.
You have to choose.

17:11.998 --> 17:14.000
I don't know what to do.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.137
Look, come on.

17:17.237 --> 17:20.307
If we put our heads together,
we can figure this out.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.977
- You just solved it!
- You bet I did.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.846
What exactly did I do?

17:26.946 --> 17:30.250
- You solved it.
- You bet I did.

17:35.522 --> 17:36.889
Thank you, Soccer Mary.

17:36.989 --> 17:39.559
You did a wonderful job
fielding those questions.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.661
- (applause)
- (Harper laughing loudly)

17:41.761 --> 17:46.133
Will somebody let this man
host the Oscars, okay?

17:46.233 --> 17:47.900
I hate seeing you like this.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.271
And that brings us
to our final USA Bae of Todae.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.473
Carly Shay, the...

17:53.573 --> 17:55.908
Did we ever land
on your personality?

17:56.008 --> 17:57.544
- We did not.
- Okay.

17:57.644 --> 18:00.147
- Thank you, Byron.
- Yes, thank you, Byron.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.349
(applause)

18:02.449 --> 18:04.717
I am honored
to be here today.

18:04.817 --> 18:07.787
But unfortunately,
the designers weren't able

18:07.887 --> 18:09.989
to capture who I am.

18:10.089 --> 18:14.461
Because all any person is
cannot be represented

18:14.561 --> 18:16.496
by just one doll.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.999
But we can start
to get there...

18:20.099 --> 18:22.068
- with two.
- (audience gasps, screams)

18:22.169 --> 18:23.703
Oh!

18:37.049 --> 18:40.119
This is Albuquerque
all over again!

18:40.220 --> 18:41.954
At least this time,
no one died.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.557
(sighs)
What was I thinking?

18:44.657 --> 18:46.593
I should have never agreed
to use a monkey

18:46.693 --> 18:49.061
- to save my relationship.
- Excuse me?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.764
What do you mean,
save your relationship?

18:51.864 --> 18:55.535
Uh... Sully and I have
a backgammon game to finish.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.939
Hey.
What are you talking about?

19:00.873 --> 19:02.342
Look, it's just, you and I

19:02.442 --> 19:04.411
haven't been spending
as much time together lately.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.812
And I was starting to worry

19:05.912 --> 19:07.146
that maybe you were losing
interest in me.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.249
So, Spencer got us
a monkey to take care of

19:09.349 --> 19:11.484
because he thought it would
bring us closer together?

19:11.584 --> 19:13.353
Uh, yeah.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.855
I really thought I was gonna
have to explain more.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.424
Actually, not such a bad idea.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.025
Thank you!

19:19.125 --> 19:22.495
You know, Freddie,
in all my past relationships,

19:22.595 --> 19:24.331
I always went too fast.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.299
I just didn't wanna mess
things up with you,

19:26.399 --> 19:27.734
so I've been taking it slow.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.036
Oh, my God,
I take things too fast, too.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.239
Normally at this stage of
a relationship, I'd be married.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.741
You haven't even met
my parents yet.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.844
You've met my parents,
haven't you?

19:37.944 --> 19:40.513
It was a casual brunch.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.315
And then two dinners.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.951
Damn it!
How did you win already?

19:45.051 --> 19:47.954
I'll tell you how.
You cheated!

19:48.054 --> 19:50.523
Don't think I've forgotten
how you got us into trouble

19:50.623 --> 19:52.759
at that monkey brothel
in the Maldives.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.262
Just take it.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.898
Yeah, gloat.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.772
Well, I thought it was just
gonna be the two of us.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.340
(clicks tongue)
Told you she wouldn't like you

20:07.440 --> 20:08.575
- being here.
- Oh, no!

20:08.675 --> 20:11.077
No, I'm a real girls' girl.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.680
So, did I tell you
I'm a stylist?

20:13.780 --> 20:15.315
(imitating alarm)

20:15.415 --> 20:16.649
Fun idea alert!

20:16.749 --> 20:19.952
Pick a year
from 1743 until now,

20:20.052 --> 20:22.422
and I'll give you
all the names

20:22.522 --> 20:25.392
of every Bae that year.

20:26.326 --> 20:29.228
Maybe we could talk about
something other than work.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.031
- Tell me about your family.
- The dolls are my family.

20:32.131 --> 20:34.066
And they're not wild
about your questions.

20:34.634 --> 20:38.905
Byron, I'm about to get up
and walk away from you forever.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.240
But before I do,
I need you to know

20:41.341 --> 20:43.676
that it's not because you work
in a doll store.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.612
It's not even because
you work in a doll store

20:45.712 --> 20:47.580
and you're incredibly creepy
about it.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.517
It's because you have shown
no interest in me whatsoever,

20:50.617 --> 20:52.051
and I'm awesome.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.687
(with British accent):
Girl power!

20:54.787 --> 20:56.856
(gasps)

20:56.956 --> 21:00.793
Gemma, Nebraska, 1997.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.062
Maybe we can push it
as one of those

21:03.162 --> 21:04.831
"it's so ugly,
it's cute" things.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.599
It works for pugs.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.601
Hey, you really gotta run
this stuff by me.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.437
You know you pay me, right?

21:11.304 --> 21:12.672
I just wanted
to be a role model.

21:12.772 --> 21:13.973
You are.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.875
I mean, all these kids
are here for you.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.810
And like I said before,

21:17.910 --> 21:19.245
I'll support whatever
you want to do.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.981
You know, you want me
to push this horror show?

21:22.081 --> 21:24.351
We sold a lot worse
on Italian QVC.

21:24.451 --> 21:25.718
You remember the egg coat?

21:25.818 --> 21:28.888
It literally cooked eggs
in the sleeve.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.525
No, kids do not want this doll.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.327
No, they want the hot doll.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.363
But I know that's not you.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.499
Well, maybe it doesn't
have to be me.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.970
Everyone, enjoy this
nameless doll that isn't me!

21:44.070 --> 21:47.340
But she's sexy
and an entrepreneur,

21:47.440 --> 21:48.508
and you can be, too!

21:48.608 --> 21:51.177
Emily Ratajkowski
wrote a book.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.882
Will you accept this, Rose?

21:57.183 --> 21:58.851
So pretty!

22:02.154 --> 22:05.057
Well, good news, I got your name
taken off every doll.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.693
You won't earn a single cent,

22:06.793 --> 22:08.761
which means I won't earn
a single cent.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.030
Integrity! It's great.

22:11.130 --> 22:13.800
(sighs)
You are no longer a USA Bae.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.568
Look, I'm really sorry

22:15.668 --> 22:18.004
that you have to send your
coffee table back to Morocco.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.939
It's fine.
No, it's just that thing

22:20.039 --> 22:22.274
was really gonna bring
my living room together.

22:22.375 --> 22:25.412
But, glad you feel good
about your decision.

22:25.512 --> 22:30.883
When I grow up, I wanna turn
a profit by turning heads.

22:32.919 --> 22:35.354
Yep. Great.

22:37.156 --> 22:39.926
I need this monster in my life.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.000
Sully, I thought you had

22:48.100 --> 22:49.769
that early morning flight
to Luxembourg.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.938
He has some
unfinished business.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.706
He always does.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.174
Hey, can you get us
some popsicles?

22:55.274 --> 22:57.076
Yeah, but there's only
one grape one left,

22:57.176 --> 22:59.311
and you know
Spencer's gonna be...

22:59.412 --> 23:00.480
(scream)

23:00.580 --> 23:03.182
(both laughing)

23:04.116 --> 23:07.119
And now, his business
is finished.

23:14.160 --> 23:17.396
* *

23:36.483 --> 23:38.384
Ooh!

23:38.485 --> 23:40.687
MAN:
He hates these cans.
