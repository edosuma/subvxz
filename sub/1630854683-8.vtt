WEBVTT

00:05.172 --> 00:06.505
News anchor: Overnight,
the city was hit

00:06.574 --> 00:08.507
With a massive snowstorm,

00:08.509 --> 00:10.375
Paralysing roads
and stopping traffic

00:10.411 --> 00:11.877
In its tracks.

00:11.879 --> 00:14.046
It's bumper to bumper
out there, friends.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.847
If you don't have to go out,

00:15.883 --> 00:18.650
Do not go out.

00:18.652 --> 00:21.453
But sorry, kids,
schools are open.

00:21.489 --> 00:22.788
It's 8:12.

00:28.262 --> 00:31.130
(shivering)

00:31.265 --> 00:32.731
Shovelled the driveway!

00:32.866 --> 00:35.534
Hercules! Hercules!
The whole thing?

00:35.536 --> 00:38.670
Well, not the whole thing,
but the part behind the van.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.006
I'm taking back one "hercules".
How do the roads look?

00:41.075 --> 00:42.674
Oh, bad.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.811
The snow plough hasn't
come by yet, street or sidewalk.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.446
Kids!

00:47.515 --> 00:50.015
I have to drive you to school!
Leaving in twenty!

00:50.017 --> 00:51.683
Khia: Okay, dad!

00:53.054 --> 00:54.419
Andrew:
Shouldn't sam be here already?

00:54.422 --> 00:56.221
On her way.

00:56.257 --> 00:58.357
She's bringing this fancy new
lens that attaches to my tablet,

00:58.359 --> 01:00.292
So I look super-profesh.

01:00.294 --> 01:01.759
Oh...

01:01.761 --> 01:04.629
Your first tv segment, wow!
So proud.

01:04.698 --> 01:07.633
That kardi and jully black
dinner is paying off big.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.367
Tell me about it.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.237
Live from rockridge,
it's Wednesday morning.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.006
I can't believe
how calm you are.

01:14.141 --> 01:16.241
I've done livestreams before.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.443
Yeah, but this is
live television.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.912
You're out of the stream.
You're in the ocean now!

01:20.948 --> 01:23.381
Look at me. Look at me.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.450
I am the tv chef now.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.952
Okay, okay.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.586
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, later.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.389
But first, I need you to
get the hell out of the house

01:30.524 --> 01:32.057
Before 8:30.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.359
Aye, aye, captain.
We'll be gone way before then.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.872
Andrew: Ooh...

01:47.007 --> 01:49.207
You ready for your
team-building exercise?

01:49.243 --> 01:50.942
- Ahh! Ooh!
- Hey, stop that.

01:50.978 --> 01:53.145
I'm gonna put the "exercise" in
"team building exercise".

01:53.280 --> 01:54.813
Alley-oop!

01:54.948 --> 01:56.615
Sure, but isn't team building
supposed to be, like,

01:56.684 --> 01:59.417
Trust falls in the woods
or something new.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.286
You and hudson play
basketball all the time.

02:01.288 --> 02:04.422
Not in the winter. Plus,
court time is super hard to get.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.024
I booked this like a year ago

02:06.093 --> 02:07.693
When old man hargreaves
had a heart attack.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.361
You took a spot from a dead man?

02:09.430 --> 02:10.996
He was only dead
for a few minutes.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.698
He's a survivor.
I regret nothing.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.634
- Ak.
- Kids! Let's go!

02:15.636 --> 02:17.001
I just gotta make sure
I get there on time.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.704
Why?

02:18.839 --> 02:21.439
Is old man hargreaves waiting
to take his spot back.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.375
Yeah, him and those
pickle ball bitches.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.243
- "bitches", wow.
- I know!

02:25.279 --> 02:26.978
They're just so smug with
their little paddles

02:27.047 --> 02:29.447
And their seniors discounts.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.317
- Hi, dad.
- Andrew: Hey.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.253
Morning, khia.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.455
Andrew:
Khia, we gotta leave asap.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.223
Yeah, I'm just getting my lunch.

02:38.358 --> 02:40.124
Excuse me.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.594
Okay.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.196
I'm just going to get my creps.

02:45.232 --> 02:47.299
Did you know the brits
call their shoes "creps"?

02:47.434 --> 02:52.003
You don't care.
Exiting awkwardly.

02:52.039 --> 02:54.138
Are you seriously
still mad about last night?

02:55.409 --> 02:56.608
(sighing)

02:56.644 --> 02:59.144
Oh, the wi-fi is out.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.412
What?!

03:00.547 --> 03:02.247
No, no, no.
I need that.

03:02.316 --> 03:05.350
Andrew, your fancy
new router isn't working!

03:05.386 --> 03:06.618
- Andrew!
- (phone vibrating)

03:06.753 --> 03:09.154
- Oh. (sighing)
- (phone vibrating)

03:09.289 --> 03:10.989
Uh, khia,
we're not done here, okay?

03:11.058 --> 03:12.824
We're talking before you leave.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.159
Sam, what's up?

03:14.228 --> 03:16.762
So, my train was cancelled.

03:16.764 --> 03:18.697
I got a ride,
but the roads are a mess.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.165
We're not even moving.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.301
Uh, okay.
Well, how far are you?

03:22.436 --> 03:23.635
I'll be there before 8:30.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.637
- How much before?
- 8:29.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.039
- Sam!
- I know. I know. I'm so sorry.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.708
Look, the lens is
super easy to put on.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.176
I'll be there soon.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.178
Oh, great. Okay, well,
I'm hanging up now.

03:33.313 --> 03:34.846
Step on it!

03:34.882 --> 03:36.515
Driver: And go where, fam?
I can't go no place.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.683
Yeah, I know. I've just always
wanted to say that.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.526
How does a ring light just
grow legs and walk away?

03:47.661 --> 03:51.663
Khia, did you put my ring light
back after your school thing?

03:51.798 --> 03:54.365
I, uh... Don't remember.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.401
Okay, well,
can you find it?

03:56.470 --> 03:57.869
Please?

03:57.938 --> 04:00.672
Quickly.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.474
Yes, thank you.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.478
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you're going the wrong way.

04:06.547 --> 04:09.281
What? Well, apparently,
your wife needs something.

04:09.283 --> 04:12.017
Uh, my wife's name is "mom".

04:12.152 --> 04:14.686
Your mom. Not my mom.
Just hurry.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.355
Leaving in fifteen.
Tell your brother.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.094
Babe, is my big gym bag--

04:23.163 --> 04:26.765
Is my big gym--
is my big... Gym...

04:26.834 --> 04:28.433
Bag down here?

04:28.502 --> 04:30.769
Um... You're the one
that organized the basement.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.237
Did you check
the big ban gym bag?

04:32.239 --> 04:33.839
I mean, the big...

04:33.974 --> 04:35.507
Gym... Bag bin.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.241
That is a tongue twister.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.644
Big jam bin big.
Bin gym bag ban.

04:39.647 --> 04:40.979
- Big ban gym bin...
- I'll just take one pair.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.581
Bin ban gym--
big bag gym bag--

04:43.651 --> 04:46.584
Bin bag-- oh! Damn it, camille!

04:46.654 --> 04:48.986
Khia!
Can I borrow your blush, please?

04:49.023 --> 04:51.990
Khia: Dad, I think your wife
is saying something.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.394
Hmm...
Ankle support or looking fresh?

04:55.529 --> 04:58.396
Ooh, looking fresh it is.

04:58.432 --> 05:01.666
Dad, leo isn't in
his room or the bathroom.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.204
Did he go to school already?

05:06.339 --> 05:08.874
He was working on a blueprint
for a snow fort last night.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.542
Oh, so proud.

05:10.677 --> 05:12.210
Oh, I saw him headed
to the basement earlier.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.478
He looked weird.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.513
Oh.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.814
Okay, thanks. Hurry up.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.049
Ring light?

05:17.184 --> 05:18.316
I don't have it yet.

05:18.451 --> 05:19.584
Why not?

05:19.719 --> 05:20.786
'cause I was doing
stuff for dad.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.087
You are supposed to be helping!

05:22.156 --> 05:23.655
I thought I was!

05:23.657 --> 05:25.223
Well, can you help her
find the ring light?

05:25.225 --> 05:27.225
Khia: No. I'll find it myself.
Just relax.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.894
Okay, and your blush.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.228
(sighing)

05:30.230 --> 05:32.097
- Leo!
- Ahh! Ahh! Router the reset--

05:32.232 --> 05:33.632
Reset the router!

05:41.041 --> 05:42.440
Leo, buddy, you down here?

05:42.576 --> 05:44.175
Leo: Yeah.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.045
We gotta go.

05:48.082 --> 05:51.048
What's going on?
Taco Tuesday not sitting well?

05:51.085 --> 05:53.118
You got a little rumble gut?
Firerhea?

05:53.253 --> 05:54.986
Leo: No.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.755
I had...

05:56.890 --> 05:58.990
The dream.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.460
Andrew: The one where
the clown is chasing you?

06:01.595 --> 06:04.062
Buddy, we all get nightmares.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.597
You know what I do?

06:05.599 --> 06:07.532
I draw a picture of my dream.

06:07.601 --> 06:10.135
Sometimes
I put googly eyes them.

06:10.204 --> 06:13.004
No, dad.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.540
The wet type of dream.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.509
Wet dream?

06:17.578 --> 06:21.078
(gasping)
it's raining men.

06:29.423 --> 06:33.291
Welcome to the club, buddy!
How do you feel?

06:33.293 --> 06:34.626
I dunno.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.494
You said it was gonna be fun.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.096
It is fun.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.965
My first time I dreamt
about carmen sandiego.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.234
It was all about the chase.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.237
Yeah, I don't even
remember the dream.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.106
I just went to bed...

06:48.241 --> 06:50.708
And woke up with sticky shorts.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.711
I'll get you a clean pair.

06:52.713 --> 06:55.313
(gasping) the dream kit!
I forgot. I'll be right back.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.720
Leo, don't be ashamed, my boy.

07:01.722 --> 07:05.323
The journey of a thousand oceans
begins with a single drop.

07:07.794 --> 07:10.128
â™ª

07:11.799 --> 07:14.666
There's gonna be
a thousand of these?

07:14.668 --> 07:18.603
(groaning)

07:18.605 --> 07:20.572
Hudson (recorded:)
pick up the phone, buddy!

07:20.574 --> 07:22.741
It's me! Huddy-hudd!

07:22.743 --> 07:25.076
Hudson, my dawg!
What's up?

07:25.078 --> 07:26.211
Hudson: How far away are you?

07:26.346 --> 07:27.745
Leaving in a sec.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.214
Hudson: You haven't left yet?!

07:29.349 --> 07:30.949
If we're not on
the court by 8:45,

07:31.018 --> 07:32.283
They're gonna give it away, man!

07:32.418 --> 07:33.952
I'm coming, I'm coming.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.486
I just gotta drop
the kids off at school first.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.154
Hudson: Old man hargreaves
is walking around

07:37.191 --> 07:38.389
Slapping his pickle ball racket.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.091
It's intimidating!

07:40.160 --> 07:42.961
Okay, okay, okay, I'm on my way.
Love you. Bye.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.096
Hudson: Love you, too. Hurry!

07:49.169 --> 07:51.569
Hey! Leaving in ten! No excuses!

07:51.705 --> 07:52.803
Why are you yelling at me?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.706
I've been ready,
waiting for you.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.674
Where's leo?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.643
Dream kit!

08:02.149 --> 08:03.414
Ah! Yes, yes, yes, in the flesh.

08:03.450 --> 08:06.718
Thank you.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.453
So, um...

08:08.522 --> 08:10.922
You planning on
staying salty all day?

08:10.991 --> 08:12.657
You violated my privacy.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.459
No, I was just--

08:14.528 --> 08:17.329
You looked through
my phone at 2 a.M.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.664
Yes. But it's not
what you think.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.132
Okay. Then, what was it?

08:21.168 --> 08:23.602
- I... Um...
- (phone vibrating)

08:23.737 --> 08:25.203
I will tell you when I--

08:25.338 --> 08:28.472
Boy, they really want
to clean our ducts, huh?

08:28.509 --> 08:30.408
You know what? Just tell dad
that I'm changing super quick.

08:30.544 --> 08:31.676
Khia, there's no time.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.010
- Super quick!
- Khia!

08:33.046 --> 08:34.546
(sighing)

08:34.548 --> 08:36.514
(phone vibrating)

08:38.685 --> 08:40.018
(sighing)

08:40.087 --> 08:41.419
Driver: Yo, like,
what are these cars

08:41.421 --> 08:42.687
Even doing out here right now?

08:42.723 --> 08:43.989
It's a snowstorm, like-- like,

08:44.124 --> 08:45.857
Why are you even out here?
It's just like--

08:45.859 --> 08:48.760
Hey! Hey! Hey! This car's
trying to-- I'm here, dog.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.662
You can't come over here

08:50.664 --> 08:52.430
'cause I'm, like, literally in
the place you're trying to be.

08:52.432 --> 08:54.665
Two things can't
occupy the same space, fam.

08:59.039 --> 09:02.307
Andrew: It's perfectly natural.
Every man goes through it.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.842
Think of your body like a phone.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.579
It only has so
many gigs of memory.

09:07.581 --> 09:11.115
So, when it gets full, it
automatically empties the cache.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.250
Empties the cache?

09:13.287 --> 09:14.585
Yeah.

09:14.587 --> 09:16.588
Or you can do it manually.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.856
Think of your body like
a recycling bin.

09:18.858 --> 09:21.259
When it gets full,
you gotta empty it.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.127
On Sunday?

09:23.196 --> 09:24.929
Or Monday.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.865
Sometimes Tuesday, Wednesday,

09:27.000 --> 09:28.199
Twice on thursdays.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.335
Look. You'll learn that, really,

09:30.404 --> 09:33.671
Any day is a good day
to release the kraken.

09:33.707 --> 09:36.207
How do I release the kraken?

09:36.209 --> 09:37.976
Andrew: I got you covered, bro.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.711
All of your questions will be
answered with the dream kit.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.952
I got the idea from a period kit
we bought your sister.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.888
None of the stores sell them
for boys, so I made up my own.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.089
So unfair.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.690
Girls get everything.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.826
Nope. Never say that again.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.962
So, you want to stay home?
Go to school?

09:57.965 --> 09:59.630
Come play ball
with me and hudson?

09:59.666 --> 10:02.099
I think I want to go to school.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.301
Andrew: Okay then.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.770
Whoa! We gotta go!

10:09.343 --> 10:11.443
Thanks, dad.

10:11.445 --> 10:14.179
Moby's gonna be so jealous
when I tell him about this.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.714
Oh, buddy, don't be that kid
that brags about sex dreams.

10:22.656 --> 10:24.455
Now, green chillies...

10:24.491 --> 10:27.458
Green chillies, green chillies.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.260
That, and then
we'll add you...

10:29.396 --> 10:30.862
Andrew: Remember what I said.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.030
"the journey of
a thousand oceans

10:32.099 --> 10:33.297
"begins with a single drop."

10:33.333 --> 10:35.166
That's my man!

10:37.470 --> 10:39.404
What happened to being
out of here before 8:30?

10:39.473 --> 10:41.206
We'll be gone,

10:41.208 --> 10:45.143
But we had to talk 'cause
last night, he had the dream.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.278
- The one about the clown?
- No!

10:47.414 --> 10:49.080
The dream?

10:49.215 --> 10:50.648
The dream. The dream...

10:50.651 --> 10:52.150
Oh my god.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.385
The dream?! What?

10:54.454 --> 10:56.688
But he's a boy. My baby boy!

10:56.823 --> 10:58.756
Well, now, he's a big boy
who can make baby boys.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.558
- Okay, tmi.
- (phone vibrating)

11:00.694 --> 11:02.894
- Oh, god.
- (phone vibrating)

11:02.963 --> 11:04.295
Do you know this number?

11:04.297 --> 11:06.464
I don't recognize any number.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.766
- (phone vibrating)
- hello?

11:07.901 --> 11:09.033
Woman: Hi. Is this camille?

11:09.036 --> 11:10.969
- Yes.
- Woman: Fantastic.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.171
I'm farah, a producer at
rockridge morning live.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.506
And I've been trying
to get a hold of you.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.174
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
I'm so sorry!

11:16.243 --> 11:17.975
I didn't recognize the number.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.544
Farah: It's okay.
We just need you

11:19.546 --> 11:21.145
On the call in five minutes
before we go live.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.513
Can you jump on?

11:22.549 --> 11:24.649
Five minutes?
Definitely. Will do.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.617
On it.
Oh, and thank you.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.986
Farah: No problem. We just need
to check your levels

11:29.056 --> 11:30.588
And make sure
the signal is strong. Otherwise,

11:30.724 --> 11:32.857
We'll have to drop the segment
and go with our backup.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.259
Brynn met christopher walken
over the weekend

11:35.328 --> 11:36.561
And has a story that is unreal.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.862
Oh, wow. Amazing.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.530
Love christopher walken.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.999
But I will be ready,
so she won't need that. Okay?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.735
Farah: Great.
See you in a couple minutes.

11:43.737 --> 11:44.903
A couple minutes?

11:45.038 --> 11:46.404
A couple minutes!
Okay, okay. Bye!

11:46.539 --> 11:48.906
Farah: Yep. All right.
Okay. Bye.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.010
(whimpering)

11:53.080 --> 11:54.545
Oh, no. I know that look.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.213
I hate that look.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.015
Okay, what do you need?
I got you.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.884
I...

12:01.154 --> 12:02.687
(sighing)
no, no, no. Okay.

12:02.689 --> 12:04.489
You know what?
I think I-- I'm good.

12:04.558 --> 12:07.358
Food is good.
Tripod is good.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.226
Tablet. Tablet...

12:09.262 --> 12:10.694
Quick question while
you're calculating:

12:10.731 --> 12:12.030
Why are you and khia beefing?

12:14.935 --> 12:18.770
Oh, I snuck into her room last
night to watch her sleeping.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.638
I know she's too old for that,

12:20.640 --> 12:22.841
But I was watching euphoria
before bed and--

12:22.976 --> 12:26.044
Camille! That's parental
nightmare fuel.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.846
The kids on that show
cannot be real, right?

12:28.882 --> 12:30.248
Like, I don't want
them to be real.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.516
Oh, they're real, andrew!

12:32.552 --> 12:34.051
That's why they made
a whole show about them.

12:34.053 --> 12:35.520
And now, khia's mad
because she thinks

12:35.655 --> 12:37.255
That I checked her phone
while I was in there.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.190
Did you?

12:39.226 --> 12:41.059
A little.
(sighing)

12:41.061 --> 12:42.794
Look, I had to.
I had no choice! It lit up.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.329
I mean, what if it was her--

12:44.331 --> 12:45.797
Her drug dealer?

12:45.799 --> 12:47.999
You crossed the line, big time.

12:48.134 --> 12:50.534
I know, but she's
turning sixteen soon.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.136
I thought I was the sappy one.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.272
(sighing)
one percent?

12:54.341 --> 12:57.342
What is with this morning?
Did you reset the router?

12:57.344 --> 12:58.977
Shoot!

12:59.112 --> 13:01.579
Camille: Andrew, I need to be
online in, like, a minute!

13:03.516 --> 13:05.449
- On it!
- Camille: Oh my god.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.221
Can you grab the
long cord from your room?

13:10.356 --> 13:12.590
Thank you, princess!
You are loved!

13:12.659 --> 13:13.958
Leo: Where is my shirt?!

13:13.960 --> 13:15.492
Uh, there are a bunch
in your drawer!

13:15.529 --> 13:18.296
Leo: I had a shirt a second ago!
Somebody took it!

13:18.365 --> 13:20.031
(stammering)
did you check your shoulder!

13:20.166 --> 13:21.632
Leo: Oh! Thanks!

13:21.668 --> 13:23.501
Okay. You all need to get going!

13:23.503 --> 13:25.236
My segment is
starting very soon!

13:25.272 --> 13:26.838
Khia: Well, I'd be ready
if I didn't have to keep

13:26.840 --> 13:28.172
Running errands for a creeper.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.707
Okay, the only crime
I ever committed

13:29.843 --> 13:31.109
Was loving you so damn much!

13:31.244 --> 13:33.878
(whimpering)

13:33.947 --> 13:36.447
Andrew! I need that wi-fi up.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.783
I need to log in, like, now.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.118
Andrew: Working on it.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.919
I unplugged it,
then I plugged it back in.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.654
Then, I reset the router.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.791
Once this orange light
turns green, you're good.

13:46.926 --> 13:48.893
Camille: Okay,
it's still orange.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.562
- Why isn't it--
- just give it a second.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.129
You need to unplug it again.

13:52.131 --> 13:53.597
That'll make things worse.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.136
It's not taking.
You need to unplug it.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.203
Wait for it.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.571
We need to reset the reset!

14:00.640 --> 14:02.206
Babe, five seconds.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.475
Just give it
five seconds, right?

14:04.477 --> 14:05.710
Babe, babe, five sec--
five sec--

14:05.845 --> 14:07.612
Five-- five seconds!

14:07.681 --> 14:08.913
Just give it five seconds.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.549
(phone vibrating)

14:12.586 --> 14:13.817
Oh, god! Oh!

14:13.854 --> 14:15.653
(sighing) god, sam,

14:15.655 --> 14:17.354
Please tell me you're outside!

14:17.390 --> 14:20.158
I will be there soon.
Just a few minutes away.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.160
Okay, well, I'm freaking out.
The wi-fi isn't working.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.029
What?! No! Now?!

14:25.031 --> 14:27.164
Two seconds!
Just give it two seconds!

14:27.200 --> 14:31.468
You said that ten seconds ago!
He said that ten seconds ago!

14:34.073 --> 14:36.540
- There it is!
- (laughing crazily)

14:38.511 --> 14:40.845
We are back in business.

14:40.980 --> 14:43.081
Get here, please.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.415
Sam: Yes, yes.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.616
- (rumbling)
- no. No! No! No! No!

14:45.685 --> 14:47.518
Please no!

14:47.554 --> 14:50.054
The plough blocked us in!

14:50.123 --> 14:52.323
What's happening? You guys?

14:52.359 --> 14:54.925
(whimpering)

15:07.206 --> 15:09.307
Camille,
I have to dig the van out.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.209
Send the kids outside
when they come down.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.944
No, no, no, no! I don't have
time for that right now, okay?

15:13.079 --> 15:14.345
I have, like, um...

15:14.414 --> 15:16.547
Look at me!
I am the snow plough now.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.416
Sam, are you there?

15:18.485 --> 15:20.218
Sam:
Oh, satan's sack!

15:20.220 --> 15:21.852
We're behind a car who's stuck.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.054
Have you ever heard of
winter tires, you dill-hole?!

15:24.090 --> 15:25.289
You're welcome.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.524
Thank you.
You are loved.

15:29.195 --> 15:32.830
Mom... Mom! Mom?

15:32.866 --> 15:34.898
Stop watching euphoria
if you can't deal.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.467
Oh, I love euphoria.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.068
Oh my god, but after
I watched the pilot,

15:38.104 --> 15:40.438
All my eggs dried up
and turned to dust.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.107
I overheard you and I get it.
But seriously?

15:43.242 --> 15:45.642
I'm sorry. I trust you.

15:45.679 --> 15:47.245
Are you gonna start
acting like it?

15:47.247 --> 15:49.580
Ouch. Fair.

15:49.582 --> 15:50.781
Yes.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.984
Okay.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.819
Good luck with your...
Tv thingy.

15:57.891 --> 16:00.024
- (phone beeping)
- oh, I'm getting another call.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.926
It's the producer.
Sam, I gotta go.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.528
We just got stuck
behind more traffic.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.862
I'm gonna make a run for it.
I'm doing it!

16:04.864 --> 16:07.198
No! They haven't
done the sidewalks! Sam!

16:07.333 --> 16:08.633
Ugh! This whole morning is
madness.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.834
Hi, farah!

16:09.903 --> 16:11.402
Can you go get your brother?

16:13.606 --> 16:16.073
Hey, come on, leo! Let's go!

16:16.209 --> 16:17.575
Leo: Coming!

16:17.577 --> 16:20.311
Logging on now.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.213
Just had a battery issue.

16:23.249 --> 16:24.716
Can you see me?

16:24.851 --> 16:26.351
Farah: No.
Are you on the right link?

16:26.486 --> 16:28.486
I'm just clicking it now.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.120
Farah:
Then, how would I have seen you?

16:30.156 --> 16:32.557
Fair point.

16:32.559 --> 16:33.991
Camille, we're live
in two minutes.

16:33.994 --> 16:37.161
Two minutes? What? No. Alexa,
what time is it?

16:37.163 --> 16:38.963
Alexa: It's 8:28 a.M.

16:38.965 --> 16:40.898
- Farah: Just said that.
- Sorry.

16:40.967 --> 16:43.033
Alexa, send out an announcement:

16:43.069 --> 16:46.704
Get out. Get out now.
Get out right now.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.639
Alexa: Announcing.

16:48.641 --> 16:52.109
Camille (recorded:) get out.
Get out now. Get out right now!

16:52.245 --> 16:53.344
Getting out!

16:53.413 --> 16:54.812
Hey, put your snow pants on.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.517
Okay.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.389
Farah: Great!
Frame looks perfect.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.791
(sighing) see?

17:06.793 --> 17:07.991
We didn't need
five minutes for that.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.326
I keeps it profesh.

17:10.997 --> 17:14.865
You can't put snow pants
over your boots!

17:14.934 --> 17:17.601
I thought I had clearance!

17:17.670 --> 17:20.204
Khia: What? No.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.807
Why are your shoes not on yet?!

17:22.809 --> 17:24.475
Farah: Um...
Do you have ear buds?

17:24.511 --> 17:27.145
Might minimize
that background noise.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.345
Yes. Yes.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.282
Khia: Pull!

17:31.351 --> 17:33.751
Leo: I'm trying!

17:33.820 --> 17:35.953
Khia: No, you-- I pull,

17:36.089 --> 17:38.422
You let go!
That's the point!

17:38.458 --> 17:40.624
Stupid wet socks.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.159
Khia:
Why don't you have winter boots?

17:42.294 --> 17:44.362
Old sneakers are basically
short winter boots.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.697
Babe, I saw sam running.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.432
The snow is deep,
but she's moving fast.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.834
Please go!

17:49.836 --> 17:50.968
Andrew: We're going.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.369
Khia: Come on.
(straining)

17:52.405 --> 17:54.271
Khia, put your shoes on!

17:54.307 --> 17:55.640
Khia: Okay.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.542
Help your brother!

17:57.544 --> 17:59.644
Put my shoes on
or help my brother?

17:59.646 --> 18:01.178
Ai-yah.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.980
Okay, you don't have to go,
but you need to shut up!

18:03.116 --> 18:04.849
Farah: All right, here we go.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.718
You're going to join our crew
live in five, four...

18:07.720 --> 18:09.320
Where are you, sam?

18:09.389 --> 18:10.588
...Three, two...

18:10.657 --> 18:12.156
Shh! Shh!

18:12.192 --> 18:13.957
- Khia: Where is my other shoe?
- Andrew: Shh!

18:16.062 --> 18:18.396
Get other shoes.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.063
Thanks so much
for having me today.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.534
I have a pretty cool
recipe to share with you.

18:23.536 --> 18:27.205
It is a masala omelette
with a bacon naan roll.

18:27.207 --> 18:30.475
Leo: Ooh. So good.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.276
Camille: Uh...

18:32.278 --> 18:33.811
This was one of
my mom's favourite

18:33.946 --> 18:35.379
Sunday morning recipes.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.384
We'll fix it in the car!

18:40.386 --> 18:42.653
It was right here yesterday...

18:42.689 --> 18:44.488
Hudson (recorded:)
pick up the phone, buddy!

18:44.524 --> 18:48.025
It's me! Huddy-hudd!
You ain't picked me up yet?!

18:48.161 --> 18:51.229
Now, green chilies are key.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.864
â™ª best friends! â™ª

18:53.933 --> 18:55.432
â™ª we are â™ª

18:55.468 --> 18:57.602
â™ª best friends â™ª

18:57.604 --> 18:59.503
Just roast them at a slow,

18:59.539 --> 19:00.771
Slow level.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.773
Put on your shoes.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.376
I have to find this one because
it goes better with my outfit.

19:05.511 --> 19:09.046
Any... Shoe!

19:09.082 --> 19:10.714
I'm here!
(gasping)

19:10.750 --> 19:13.150
I'm here!
(breathing heavily)

19:13.219 --> 19:16.988
I actually like to make
my bacon in the oven.

19:17.123 --> 19:20.591
It cooks it more evenly and...

19:20.660 --> 19:23.394
Saves my clothes
from grease splatter.

19:23.529 --> 19:26.063
Pop-pop!

19:28.234 --> 19:29.400
Hi, sam.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.402
- Bye, sam.
- We're going!

19:31.471 --> 19:35.072
Now, you can do egg whites

19:35.141 --> 19:36.607
As an option...

19:36.609 --> 19:38.209
Let's go! Let's go!

19:38.278 --> 19:41.078
My jacket!

19:42.815 --> 19:44.615
...But I love me some yolk.

19:44.617 --> 19:53.824
â™ª

19:53.860 --> 19:57.394
Now, these eggs
are almost ready.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.564
Hey!
And let there be light.

19:59.699 --> 20:03.767
Now, if you're not about that
naan-life, you could always...

20:03.803 --> 20:05.569
Go out and buy from the store.

20:05.605 --> 20:08.239
But I like to make
mine from scratch.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.507
And it's a pretty simple recipe.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.709
- (door closing)
- but, um...

20:11.844 --> 20:13.044
Leo. Leo, no.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.980
- It's on--
- leo: Forgot my lunch.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.782
Hey, buddy!

20:17.784 --> 20:19.784
Have a great day
at school, okay?

20:19.919 --> 20:21.786
Did dad tell you the good news?

20:21.921 --> 20:24.921
I had a wet dream. I'm a man!

20:24.958 --> 20:28.192
Wow...
Congratulations.

20:34.801 --> 20:38.468
The next on is, um,
the dry ingredients.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.943
Team-building was awesome.

20:46.980 --> 20:49.546
Got there in time to help hudson
scare away some seniors,

20:49.548 --> 20:51.816
Played ball,
then we hit up the hot tub.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.684
It was perfection.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.886
Any feedback from
the morning show segment?

20:55.888 --> 20:57.954
Oh, yeah.
They're really happy.

20:57.991 --> 21:00.824
It went great after
the initial hiccups.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.060
Sorry for not getting
everyone out on time.

21:04.430 --> 21:08.099
Hey, does leo know
he went viral?

21:08.234 --> 21:10.301
Camille: No, and let's
keep it that way.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.135
So unfair.

21:12.171 --> 21:14.639
Every month, we get cramps
and he just gets a sexy dream.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.510
Let's watch charlie's angels!

21:19.512 --> 21:20.944
Oh, man...

21:21.014 --> 21:23.047
You ain't ready for that.
