<i>  location, location, location.</i>

00:14.215 --> 00:18.183
<i>  Ice mining is all about</i>
<i>  where you chose to mine.</i>

00:18.185 --> 00:20.219
<i>  As the season reaches</i>
<i>  the midway point,</i>

00:20.221 --> 00:22.287
<i>  the question is...</i>

00:22.289 --> 00:24.323
<i>  Stay the course,</i>

00:24.325 --> 00:28.293
<i>  or pack up camp</i>
<i>  in search of golden pastures?</i>

00:28.295 --> 00:31.330
<i>  But with an endless assault</i>
<i>  of blizzards,</i>

00:31.332 --> 00:32.664
<i>  an ever-present threat...</i>

00:32.666 --> 00:34.400
<i> [shawn pomrenke] oh, baby!</i>

00:34.402 --> 00:36.835
<i>  ...Will the decision</i>
<i>  be the best move...</i>

00:36.837 --> 00:39.038
Yeah! [yelling]

00:39.040 --> 00:41.473
we got an open water lead
out there.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.741
<i>  ...Or the worst move?</i>

00:42.743 --> 00:44.543
Uh-oh. You okay?

00:44.545 --> 00:46.045
[zeke tenhoff over radio]
<i>  it's terrifying.</i>

00:46.047 --> 00:48.547
They have to send
the helicopter out
to rescue 'em.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.216
<i> [mike] or the last move</i>
<i>  that each miner makes?</i>

00:51.218 --> 00:53.786
[zeke over radio]
<i> pay close attention to my air.</i>

00:53.788 --> 00:55.320
[vernon adkison]
<i>  what's going on?</i>

00:55.322 --> 00:57.022
My light just went out.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.694
<i> [vernon] can you tell</i>
<i>  where you are from the hole?</i>

01:02.696 --> 01:04.129
No.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.746
Well, another day in paradise.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.614
Finishing out this hole,

01:23.384 --> 01:24.950
pack everything up,

01:24.952 --> 01:27.252
move the hell
to a new location.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.588
<i> [mike] vernon adkison's</i>
<i>  looking to the future,</i>

01:29.590 --> 01:32.224
<i>  but there could be</i>
<i>  trouble up ahead.</i>

01:32.226 --> 01:35.928
We got an open water lead
out there,
a few hundred yards.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.966
As the ice breaks off,
it's gonna keep chipping away

01:40.968 --> 01:42.801
until, eventually,
it gets to where we are

01:42.803 --> 01:46.672
and possibly behind us,
between us and the beach.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.540
That happens every year
up here.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.477
People get stranded on
the ice, the ice goes out.

01:51.479 --> 01:54.279
<i>  They have to send the</i>
<i>  helicopter out to rescue 'em.</i>

01:54.281 --> 01:56.281
The gold streak that we're
on right now is headed

01:56.283 --> 01:58.484
in that direction
and we're gonna stay on it

01:58.486 --> 02:00.452
till we can't
stay on it anymore.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.989
<i>  We got a good news-bad news</i>
<i>  scenario.</i>

02:03.991 --> 02:05.491
<i>  Good news, we're killing it.</i>

02:05.493 --> 02:09.495
Possibly on track to break
my 200-ounce goal

02:09.497 --> 02:11.497
<i>  and set a new record.</i>

02:11.499 --> 02:14.133
Bad news, we're coming to the
end of our reach on this spot

02:14.135 --> 02:16.935
and we're not sure which way
the pay streak goes.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.670
<i>  Looks like our pay streak</i>
<i>  is headed</i>

02:18.672 --> 02:20.672
<i>  straight towards</i>
<i>  that lead out there.</i>

02:20.674 --> 02:21.607
<i>  If that's the case,</i>

02:21.609 --> 02:24.042
<i>  it's going</i>
<i>  to be dangerous as hell.</i>

02:24.044 --> 02:26.512
<i>  Even a mild winter storm</i>
<i>  can break off the ice</i>

02:26.514 --> 02:28.313
<i>  and send us out to sea.</i>

02:28.315 --> 02:30.182
But if that's where
the super gold goes,

02:30.184 --> 02:31.683
we might not have a choice.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.085
[machine whirring]

02:33.087 --> 02:36.054
-all right, let's go.
-All right, let's get it.
Get it down there!

02:41.962 --> 02:43.929
Can you hear me okay?

02:43.931 --> 02:47.099
[gary simpson]
yeah. Sounds good.

02:47.101 --> 02:48.667
<i> [vernon] okay, feels good.</i>

02:51.672 --> 02:54.907
Give me an update when you
start getting into something.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.876
<i>  Yeah, so, uh...</i>

02:59.280 --> 03:01.647
I'll find what's--
what's available to me.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.119
<i>  Wow.</i>

03:10.658 --> 03:12.257
<i> [vernon] well,</i>
<i>  that's what I like to hear.</i>

03:12.259 --> 03:13.859
Yeah, I'm actually
seeing some pretty good,

03:13.861 --> 03:17.029
decent gold
coming out of this stuff.

03:17.031 --> 03:20.699
Okay, real good, I think gary
was telling me that was

03:20.701 --> 03:23.402
<i>  the best area that</i>
<i>  we were working so far.</i>

03:23.404 --> 03:25.871
I'll stay out of your hair,
get after it.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.906
<i>  All right, sounds good.</i>

03:27.908 --> 03:29.841
Definitely there's gold here.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.679
He's got an area left
to work down there

03:33.681 --> 03:37.616
that'll keep him busy probably
for his entire dive.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.686
-And then, uh--
<i>  -argh, damn it.</i>

03:40.688 --> 03:42.087
Oh, [bleep].

03:43.991 --> 03:46.058
My light just went out, guys.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.704
<i> [vernon] uh, the power...</i>

03:58.706 --> 04:02.174
<i>  I don't know what's--</i>
<i>  what's up with that.</i>

04:02.176 --> 04:04.810
Yeah, we got some
kind of short here, guys.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.945
The dab light is out.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.516
[vernon speaking]

04:12.186 --> 04:13.385
no.

04:13.988 --> 04:15.087
[stammers] uh-- um...

04:16.023 --> 04:17.155
Hold on.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.728
[vernon speaking]

04:22.730 --> 04:24.263
[gary] okay.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.900
<i> [vernon] people don't</i>
<i>  understand how crazy it is</i>

04:28.902 --> 04:30.369
<i>  down there, under the ice.</i>

04:30.371 --> 04:32.137
<i>  With all the snow</i>
<i>  we got this season,</i>

04:32.139 --> 04:33.672
the light is not
coming through.

04:33.674 --> 04:37.276
Because of the snow pack
up top, it's pitch dark.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.444
It gets dodgy in a hurry.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.849
[vernon] that light's
not coming on, huh?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.285
<i> [over radio] no, it's not.</i>

04:46.287 --> 04:48.153
Gary's got it fixed,
it's a bad connection.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.822
Anything that's got
a cord on it,

04:50.824 --> 04:53.392
people [bleep] yank
on the cords and...

04:53.394 --> 04:54.993
That's what tears 'em up.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.369
This could be a waste of time

05:04.371 --> 05:06.171
going down there
without a light.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.473
<i>  He might not be able to see</i>
<i>  enough to get on the gold</i>

05:08.475 --> 05:10.709
<i>  and let's be honest,</i>
<i>  it's dangerous.</i>

05:10.711 --> 05:11.977
If something goes wrong,

05:11.979 --> 05:14.479
he could have trouble finding
his way back to the hole.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.523
Yeah, roger.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.328
This is [bleep].

05:29.330 --> 05:31.997
I'm trying to get 200 ounces
this season.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.498
Every day is precious.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.667
With all these storms
we've been having,

05:35.669 --> 05:37.536
uh, we gotta take
every opportunity.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.005
And so if gary's up for it,
we're going to go for it.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.441
[vernon] all right, gary.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.577
All right, go on back down.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.213
All right,
I'm headed back down.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.314
[crew member] get it!

05:50.417 --> 05:51.750
[gary] all right, let's go!

06:03.330 --> 06:06.231
<i> [vernon over radio] yo, gary.</i>
<i>  How's it looking under there?</i>

06:06.233 --> 06:09.234
It's actually not so bad.

06:09.236 --> 06:12.104
I can see a little piece
right there.

06:12.106 --> 06:15.240
All right, all right,
seein' gold.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.408
[gary chuckles]

06:18.312 --> 06:20.078
gonna be
a little slower,

06:20.080 --> 06:22.714
but I think we can get by.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.716
I'll do what I can do.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.985
<i> [vernon] all right.</i>

06:26.987 --> 06:30.422
I wanna get it all, I wanna--
I wanna mop this hole up.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.329
<i> [mike] eleven miles west...</i>

06:43.837 --> 06:46.538
Getting ready to do a move,
I'm pretty excited

06:46.540 --> 06:49.574
to see what's over here
in this next hole.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.209
Going to be good.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.979
<i>  ...Shawn pomrenke</i>
<i>  is on the move.</i>

06:55.349 --> 06:57.783
Looking for that big layer
of cheese

06:57.785 --> 07:00.252
in that yellow slab of gold.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.055
That's every
gold miner's dream.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.559
I'm on the cusp of finding
that jackpot.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.361
Last time out,
I followed that paystreak

07:09.363 --> 07:12.130
as far as I could north.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.533
<i>  And it's clear that</i>
<i>  the gold's getting better</i>

07:14.535 --> 07:17.169
<i>  the further we go north.</i>

07:17.171 --> 07:21.039
I've picked out a spot
75 feet from where I left off.

07:21.041 --> 07:24.209
We're seeing some really good
gold over this way,

07:24.211 --> 07:27.145
we're going to go ahead
and get the sluice box
moved over,

07:27.147 --> 07:30.615
get some holes cut.
Get the shacks moved over.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.551
<i>  Moving's always a risk.</i>

07:32.553 --> 07:34.453
It's going to take us
a half a day to move camp

07:34.455 --> 07:36.388
and set up a new hole.

07:36.390 --> 07:38.924
<i>  And then the rest of the day</i>
<i>  we'll use for prospecting.</i>

07:38.926 --> 07:41.860
<i>  If I'm wrong,</i>
<i>  we've wasted a whole day</i>

07:41.862 --> 07:43.528
and with the way
the weather's been,

07:43.530 --> 07:45.363
we can't afford that
this winter.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.732
Today's the day.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.768
We're going to find
something big.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.605
<i>  I'm not even half way</i>
<i>  to the 120 ounces</i>

07:53.607 --> 07:55.907
<i>  that I need to make</i>
<i>  all my payments.</i>

07:55.909 --> 07:59.244
<i>  But I'm absolutely convinced</i>
<i>  this is where the gold is.</i>

07:59.246 --> 08:01.112
It's time to roll the dice.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.682
There it is.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.821
All right, we can go that way
with that one.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.690
Nice and easy, nice and easy.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.993
Easy. There you go.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.862
Good move, good move.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.632
Got a good feeling
about this spot.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.673
[dramatic music]

08:34.314 --> 08:38.783
we got hot water going,
air compressor's going.

08:38.785 --> 08:40.886
We got water running
in the sluice box.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.821
Only thing now is for me
to get down there

08:42.823 --> 08:44.356
and suck up some gold.

08:45.993 --> 08:48.493
[machine whirring]

08:56.937 --> 08:58.803
[intense music playing]

09:03.710 --> 09:06.578
how's the ground look
down there?

09:12.553 --> 09:14.486
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

09:40.314 --> 09:41.613
Oh-ho-ho!

10:07.040 --> 10:08.039
<i>  The gold.</i>

10:27.995 --> 10:30.595
Oh, baby!

10:34.067 --> 10:36.868
Sounds like he's following
a trail of gold somewhere.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.245
<i>  I'm going to find it.</i>

10:47.247 --> 10:49.481
<i> [mike] ten miles east...</i>

10:51.118 --> 10:52.617
<i> [kris] andy.</i>

10:52.619 --> 10:54.753
Come on, let's get ready
to go to work.

10:54.755 --> 10:58.690
Oh, man, this season's kicking
my ass already.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.427
[phone ringing]

11:02.429 --> 11:04.362
hey, pat, how are you today?

11:04.364 --> 11:05.597
<i> [pat] I'm doing fine.</i>

11:05.599 --> 11:07.666
<i>  So, uh,</i>
<i>  how's my payment going?</i>

11:11.038 --> 11:14.272
I bought all this brand-new
equipment from pat keene.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.042
Now the bill is due
and I have no gold at all.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.077
This situation sucks.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.746
<i> [pat] you know, I kind of</i>
<i>  went out on a limb</i>

11:21.748 --> 11:24.816
<i>  and I kind of expected you</i>
<i>  to take care of things.</i>

11:24.818 --> 11:27.619
Pat, I swear to you,
I'm taking care of things.

11:27.621 --> 11:29.487
Uh, it was a hard start,

11:29.489 --> 11:32.424
everything's been a real bitch
to try to get this gold.

11:32.426 --> 11:34.459
<i> [pat] do me a favor,</i>

11:34.461 --> 11:36.728
<i>  just keep to your word,</i>
<i>  and, uh,</i>

11:36.730 --> 11:39.464
<i>  send the money</i>
<i>  like you promised me, okay?</i>

11:39.466 --> 11:41.366
Yes, sir, we're going
to work right away,

11:41.368 --> 11:43.068
and we're gonna make you
that money right away.

11:43.070 --> 11:46.004
<i>  I know-- but, hey,</i>
<i>  I wouldn't do this</i>
<i>  for anyone else.</i>

11:46.006 --> 11:48.139
-We're on a lot of gold!
<i>  -That's fine but--</i>

11:48.141 --> 11:51.042
I'll have your money and
you're going to be very happy.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.646
<i>  -Okay.</i>
<i> -Thank you, pat.</i>

11:54.648 --> 11:56.247
I'll call you later.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.782
<i>  -Okay.</i>
<i> -Okay, bye, pat.</i>

12:00.420 --> 12:02.353
Well, I didn't need that.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.793
It's probably not
the most honest thing

12:08.795 --> 12:10.829
to tell him we're on gold
when we're not.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.198
<i>  So what am I supposed to tell</i>
<i>  him, the truth?</i>

12:13.200 --> 12:14.566
The only way
this is going to work,

12:14.568 --> 12:17.469
if I get on a lot of gold
and I get it now.

12:17.471 --> 12:19.003
So, we really gotta
get out there,

12:19.005 --> 12:20.972
we gotta work as hard
as we can.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.108
Let's go.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.477
<i>  This is what you call</i>
<i>  a crisis point.</i>

12:25.479 --> 12:28.246
<i>  After a season and a half</i>
<i>  of crisis points,</i>

12:28.248 --> 12:29.581
this one could end us.

12:29.583 --> 12:33.084
Not to mention, I'm about
to be a father any day now.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.587
Now we're ready
to rock and roll,
let's get this going.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.123
[engine revving]

12:38.125 --> 12:40.158
everything is riding on today.

12:51.772 --> 12:54.639
Come on!
<i>  Yalla, yalla, empty.</i>

12:57.210 --> 12:58.710
Okay, it's moving day,

12:58.712 --> 13:00.145
we're gonna chip
everything out,

13:00.147 --> 13:02.547
get everything up broken free
out of the snow

13:02.549 --> 13:05.950
because we gotta go find
our new spot right now.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.052
<i> [mike] the kellys</i>
<i>  are on life support</i>

13:08.054 --> 13:11.890
<i>  as their life line may soon</i>
<i>  be pulling the plug.</i>

13:11.892 --> 13:14.092
We're going to start
to get our luck back

13:14.094 --> 13:15.960
because this is
a bunch of bull [bleep].

13:17.330 --> 13:19.330
I admit,
I painted us into a corner.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.065
I owe
a lot of money right now.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.736
I need at least 25 ounces to
come out a winner this season

13:24.738 --> 13:27.372
<i>  and I need to pay off this</i>
<i>  equipment asap.</i>

13:27.374 --> 13:29.707
<i>  But right now, we're having</i>
<i>  the worst winter</i>
<i>  we've ever had.</i>

13:29.709 --> 13:32.677
I gotta get us on the gold
today or our season's over.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.913
We're gonna go
closer to shore,

13:34.915 --> 13:38.383
around this
15 to 17-foot depth range.

13:38.385 --> 13:41.119
<i>  Um, we're going to drill</i>
<i>  holes, look for cobble</i>

13:41.121 --> 13:43.421
<i>  and then that's where we're</i>
<i>  gonna move to.</i>

13:43.423 --> 13:45.523
Okay, should we go look
for another spot?

13:45.525 --> 13:47.659
Let's go figure out
a spot to go mine.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.229
<i>  A little secret</i>
<i>  about ice mining.</i>

13:51.231 --> 13:54.332
<i>  Picking a place to mine</i>
<i>  is an imperfect science.</i>

13:54.334 --> 13:56.501
Everyone's just taking
their best guess.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.969
<i>  First hole, chris mccully</i>
<i>  told me</i>

13:57.971 --> 13:59.537
<i>  there was going</i>
<i>  to be lots of gold,</i>

13:59.539 --> 14:01.039
<i>  it turned out to be garbage.</i>

14:01.041 --> 14:03.041
So today the kellys
are picking the spot.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.878
Hey, what do you think
we should do?

14:11.551 --> 14:13.051
Where do you
wanna go, andy?

14:14.387 --> 14:16.287
Okay.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.156
<i>  So, my dad</i>
<i>  picked out one spot,</i>

14:18.158 --> 14:19.891
<i>  my brother</i>
<i>  picked out another.</i>

14:19.893 --> 14:21.993
This is where I have to take
all the knowledge

14:21.995 --> 14:23.494
that I've acquired
as a captain

14:23.496 --> 14:25.096
and make an informed decision.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.831
Andy picked this spot,

14:26.833 --> 14:29.567
but andy's pretty lucky when
it comes to picking spots,

14:29.569 --> 14:32.337
so, you know, I always say
go with what works.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.275
<i>  My brother is a lot</i>
<i>  luckier than my dad.</i>

14:37.277 --> 14:39.510
Have you checked out
my dad's life? It's a mess.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.112
So I'm not listening to him.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.850
[brad] what's it feel like?

14:47.787 --> 14:49.153
-Hear that?
-[andy] could be rocks.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.822
[kris] oh, that's rocks.

14:51.758 --> 14:54.192
[kris] yah-ha!

14:54.194 --> 14:55.994
-Okay, let's go, this is it.
-[brad] let's go.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.462
Let's go get our stuff moved.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.934
Okay, there.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.270
This season's been
a complete bust so far,

15:05.272 --> 15:06.704
but now we're on a new spot.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.109
<i>  This looks like</i>
<i>  promising ground.</i>

15:11.111 --> 15:13.411
This is a new beginning
for us.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.914
So we're going to put up
the irish flag.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.449
<i>  Now our luck will change,</i>
<i>  everything will be great,</i>

15:18.451 --> 15:21.286
we're standing on gold.

15:21.288 --> 15:24.022
<i>  So, today, we have something</i>
<i>  else motivating us.</i>

15:24.024 --> 15:25.957
<i>  It's called fear.</i>

15:25.959 --> 15:28.559
Don't underestimate fear
as a motivator.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.663
If we don't get gold today,
we're in a lot of trouble.

15:31.665 --> 15:34.399
Today we desperately need
everything to fall into place.

15:34.401 --> 15:37.468
[intense music playing]

16:03.296 --> 16:04.362
idle up.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.431
[dramatic music playing]

16:06.433 --> 16:08.032
[machine whirring]

16:18.712 --> 16:20.745
[brad over radio]
<i>  how's it looking, kris?</i>

16:20.747 --> 16:22.914
<i>  Are you seeing any gold?</i>

16:22.916 --> 16:24.115
I don't know right now,

16:24.117 --> 16:26.217
it's still too early to tell.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.428
Here we go.

16:37.430 --> 16:40.965
<i>  Well, we're already on gold</i>
<i>  the first hole I make.</i>

16:40.967 --> 16:42.700
All right,
that's a positive note.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.977
Wow, hey. Finally.

16:52.979 --> 16:55.913
All right, good job, kris.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.649
<i>  Andy's a lucky [bleep]!</i>

16:58.651 --> 17:00.651
I knew there was going to be
gold here.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.721
Oh, yeah!

17:03.723 --> 17:05.490
Pow!

17:05.492 --> 17:07.291
[chuckles] yes.

17:07.293 --> 17:09.093
The morale gets high
when we're on big gold.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.935
<i>  We are going to kill it!</i>

17:20.073 --> 17:21.739
<i> [mike] eight miles east...</i>

17:26.613 --> 17:30.248
[zeke speaking]

17:30.250 --> 17:33.017
I've got a pretty long
piece of hose.

17:33.019 --> 17:35.953
It's about 65 feet.

17:35.955 --> 17:38.556
<i>  So the hose has to go down</i>
<i>  but then I can go out</i>

17:38.558 --> 17:41.359
probably about 35 feet

17:41.361 --> 17:43.861
away from the hole.
If I'm gonna pace it out,

17:43.863 --> 17:46.064
I got one, two...

17:46.066 --> 17:48.433
<i> [mike] today for</i>
<i>  zeke tenhoff...</i>

17:48.435 --> 17:50.601
Go probably
about this far out.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.470
So I have a pretty good
amount of range.

17:53.273 --> 17:56.074
<i>  ...Bigger is better.</i>

17:56.076 --> 17:58.242
<i> [zeke] I final got gold</i>
<i>  on our last trip out,</i>

17:58.244 --> 17:59.777
and it was super validating.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.947
But the fact remains I'm still
way behind where I need to be.

18:02.949 --> 18:06.217
I still need at least six more
ounces just to keep afloat.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.820
<i>  I need to know if the gold</i>
<i>  that I'm on is the real deal</i>

18:08.822 --> 18:11.289
or if it's just a fluke
and I need to move.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.291
The gold that I can reach
nearby the hole,

18:13.293 --> 18:15.393
I already pretty much
got it all.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.962
So today, I'm gonna be
dredging out of
the end of my hose.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.898
So, can you just
make sure that

18:20.900 --> 18:22.867
-we don't lose
the air compressor.
-Yeah. Oh, [bleep].

18:22.869 --> 18:24.535
If I don't lose air,
I'll be fine.

18:24.537 --> 18:25.703
You'll be right on
top of that.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.139
And if I have any sign
of any freeze up,

18:28.141 --> 18:31.275
I'm going to come up right
away and dry out the line.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.145
It's extremely dangerous
to put on a hose extension

18:34.147 --> 18:36.280
and go that far out
from the dive hole.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.984
<i>  If anything goes wrong, it's</i>
<i>  a much longer path to safety.</i>

18:39.986 --> 18:42.153
<i>  But it's a risk</i>
<i>  that I'm willing to take</i>

18:42.155 --> 18:45.223
to find out if this gold
is going to lead to more gold

18:45.225 --> 18:48.025
or if I'm going to have to
find a completely new spot.

18:48.027 --> 18:51.195
If-- if I don't love it,
I wanna move down to tomcod.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.399
'cause I suspect there's
a lot more gold out at tomcod.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.001
Shawn apparently
has some spots

18:57.003 --> 18:59.437
that he's interested in
having somebody check out.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.239
We could set up
and go dive there.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.241
Yeah, I hear ya.

19:03.243 --> 19:06.010
Moving down to tomcod would be
a huge decision

19:06.012 --> 19:08.913
because it would take tons
of time to move the operation,

19:08.915 --> 19:09.947
<i>  set it back up</i>

19:09.949 --> 19:11.916
<i>  and then locate</i>
<i>  a totally new pay streak.</i>

19:11.918 --> 19:13.951
I just don't really have
that kind of time

19:13.953 --> 19:15.119
to spare at this point.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.723
That's why I'm going
to give this spot

19:18.725 --> 19:20.224
one more chance
to prove itself.

19:20.226 --> 19:22.393
[intense music playing]

19:30.436 --> 19:31.802
all right.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.578
Hey, how you doing there?

19:56.095 --> 19:58.462
If I can't make
ends meet this winter,

19:58.464 --> 20:00.231
then I'm going to have
serious doubt

20:00.233 --> 20:02.300
about my future
as a gold dredger.

20:29.495 --> 20:32.330
[suspenseful music playing]

20:36.469 --> 20:38.369
you're getting a case
of the dark and scaries,

20:38.371 --> 20:40.104
you have to soldier through.

20:53.319 --> 20:54.652
<i>  Okay.</i>

20:56.489 --> 20:59.123
Yeah, he's stretched all the
way out to the south east,

20:59.125 --> 21:01.692
that direction
and it's more dangerous

21:01.694 --> 21:03.361
the further out
you go, you know?

21:03.363 --> 21:05.896
[intense music playing]

21:08.568 --> 21:10.301
[zeke groans]

21:10.303 --> 21:12.536

21:18.711 --> 21:20.044
<i>  You okay?</i>

21:23.750 --> 21:25.349
I had some water
in my mask,

21:25.351 --> 21:27.051
I'm trying to get it out.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.259
Oh, wow!

21:37.297 --> 21:38.763
You seeing gold?

21:48.675 --> 21:51.742
Awesome! That's great to hear.
Making money. I love it.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.180
There's gold here.

22:04.290 --> 22:07.024
You can just sit back,
read some fiction,

22:07.026 --> 22:09.260
listen to some
breathing noises

22:09.262 --> 22:11.495
and just let the gold roll in,
you know?

22:11.497 --> 22:12.863
Just let it roll in.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.301

-still on big gold?
<i> -[kris over radio] yep.</i>

22:38.558 --> 22:42.927
Well, the good thing is
we're gonna take it all.

<i> [mike] for kris kelly,</i>
<i>  a midseason move</i>

<i>  ...And just</i>

asked for a better spot.

23:26.572 --> 23:29.039
We needed gold today
or we were toast.

is finally coming through.

It doesn't get
any easier than that.

thinking we were in
a [bleep] situation.

24:57.763 --> 24:59.330
I've got bills

Uh, gary can't really tell
how good the gold is,

26:24.450 --> 26:26.917
so we're pulling a test pan
to check that out.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.053
Okay, all right.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.187
Not too shabby.

26:34.527 --> 26:35.459
It looks pretty good

26:35.461 --> 26:37.561
for a test pan.

26:37.563 --> 26:40.164
You know?
It looks really good.

26:41.968 --> 26:43.534
[vernon] pretty damn good.

26:43.536 --> 26:45.169
<i>  Unbelievable, I mean,</i>

26:45.171 --> 26:46.637
<i>  he's still pulling good gold,</i>

26:46.639 --> 26:48.172
<i>  even though he can't see.</i>

26:48.174 --> 26:50.007
That's just veteran
instincts, right there.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.909
You can't teach that.
What a lifesaver.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.879
[gary speaking]

27:05.625 --> 27:08.559
<i> [vernon] all right, gary, uh,</i>
<i>  so you got it mopped up?</i>

27:08.561 --> 27:10.828
<i>  You got, uh, every last</i>
<i>  little speck, right?</i>

27:19.071 --> 27:22.039
Okay, good show, gary.
I mean, I think that's all.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.008
It's gotta be
a juicy one for us.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.844
The test mats are looking
really, really good.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.512
All right.

27:28.514 --> 27:32.282
<i> [vernon] I gotta say,</i>
<i>  gary's the stud hog today.</i>

27:32.284 --> 27:34.685
<i>  I got a damn good team.</i>

27:34.687 --> 27:36.153
And we're bringing home
the gold

27:36.155 --> 27:38.589
and that's
a lethal combination.

27:38.591 --> 27:40.257
All right, he's back.

27:45.598 --> 27:47.031
All right, good. Good.

27:47.033 --> 27:50.267
The only downside to the day
is the streak is headed

27:50.269 --> 27:52.569
<i>  straight out towards</i>
<i>  that open lead out there.</i>

27:52.571 --> 27:54.438
That's where
we're going to be headed,

27:54.440 --> 27:56.540
but what's life without
a little excitement?

27:58.377 --> 28:00.044
[exhales sharply] oh!

28:01.147 --> 28:03.981
[dramatic music playing]

28:15.294 --> 28:17.961
hey, so how's that gold
holding up, man?

28:29.175 --> 28:31.341
All right.

28:31.343 --> 28:34.478
I don't wanna have to move to
tomcod if we don't have to.

28:35.448 --> 28:37.681
<i> [mike] with the aid</i>
<i>  of an extra 40 feet,</i>

28:37.683 --> 28:40.217
<i>  zeke tenhoff's</i>
<i>  west beach claim</i>

28:40.219 --> 28:42.119
<i>  just might be proving</i>
<i>  its worth.</i>

28:45.124 --> 28:48.125
[gabe] 40 feet out
in the dark, it's dangerous.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.194
If you're not making money,
it's not worth the risk.

28:50.196 --> 28:51.895
We wouldn't be out here.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.732
We're out here to make money.

28:54.734 --> 28:57.534
What was that that shawn said
years ago? He was like,

28:57.536 --> 29:00.070
"if there were chicks down
there, I'd mine them, too."

29:00.072 --> 29:01.071
[laughs]

29:17.156 --> 29:18.989
<i> [gabe] all right, roger.</i>

29:22.962 --> 29:25.028
[zeke] yeah, I think I'm
probably

29:25.030 --> 29:26.597
going to wrap this up

29:26.599 --> 29:30.300
and I definitely dredged what
I could reach with the hose

29:30.302 --> 29:32.836
um, from this-- uh, this hole.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.407
Okay, I'm going
to come on up.

29:41.313 --> 29:42.946
[gabe] he's coming
down the trail,

29:42.948 --> 29:45.048
the cavalry has arrived.

29:45.050 --> 29:47.651
All right, man, there's food
showing up right now,
if you want it.

29:47.653 --> 29:49.253
[zeke] all right.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.588
<i>  Putting on this hose</i>
<i>  extension and going way out</i>

29:51.590 --> 29:53.724
from my hole,
it's a super risky move,

29:53.726 --> 29:55.292
but after a season and a half

29:55.294 --> 29:57.060
with these little boulders
I have,

29:57.062 --> 29:58.729
I think it was the right call.

29:58.731 --> 30:01.064
<i>  Now I know there's traces</i>
<i>  of pretty decent gold</i>

30:01.066 --> 30:03.033
even further out.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.768
Oh, so the gold's
keepin' up.

30:05.704 --> 30:07.404
Out that way.

30:07.406 --> 30:08.939
Instead of moving
to tomcod right away,

30:08.941 --> 30:11.041
which would definitely
burn a lot of time,

30:11.043 --> 30:13.777
<i>  we're going to put a new dive</i>
<i>  hole right over here.</i>

30:13.779 --> 30:16.380
Hopefully this is the kind of
spot we're looking for

30:16.382 --> 30:17.815
otherwise, we're going
to be in trouble.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.619
[man] I brought three
bacon cheeseburgers

30:22.621 --> 30:24.822
and extra order fries, too.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.657
I got an extra order of fries.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.125
Thank you so much.

30:28.127 --> 30:29.359
I was getting hungry.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.762
[gabe] workin' up an appetite
down there, zeke?

30:31.764 --> 30:33.330
-[stormy crying]
-[zeke] stormy, come here.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.531

30:37.002 --> 30:38.702
<i> [mike] eight miles west...</i>

30:44.443 --> 30:46.476
Okay, man, you gotta be
getting tired,

you've been down there
forever.

30:48.280 --> 30:51.248
[andy over radio]

30:54.653 --> 30:56.320
<i>  are you still seeing</i>
<i>  a lot of gold, though?</i>

31:01.126 --> 31:04.528
<i> [mike] andy's</i>
<i>  lucky streak continues.</i>

31:04.530 --> 31:07.598
I'm only in a good mood
'cause we're making money,
by the way.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.000
[brad speaking]

31:10.002 --> 31:11.768
mccully's here,
don't say anything.

31:13.739 --> 31:16.139
Dude, it's not
looking good here.

31:16.141 --> 31:17.708
-Told you.
-Yeah.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.443
Man, you were right.
This place sucks.

31:19.445 --> 31:20.577
Pound town, [bleep].

31:20.579 --> 31:22.246
[brad] now we're worried about

31:22.248 --> 31:24.281
we might have to move
again. You know?

31:27.219 --> 31:28.852
[kris] yeah.

31:28.854 --> 31:30.654
Right now, we're coming off
a bad spot

31:30.656 --> 31:33.891
that chris suggested.
It was just sand, terrible.

31:33.893 --> 31:35.459
No, I'm not the type--

31:35.461 --> 31:37.361
yes, I am the type
to hold a grudge.

31:37.363 --> 31:40.264
<i>  So now that we're on gold,</i>
<i>  we don't want</i>
<i>  anybody around us.</i>

31:40.266 --> 31:43.000
He cost us part of the season,
so screw him.

31:43.969 --> 31:45.836
[chris speaking]

31:48.040 --> 31:51.208
yeah. We can tell down there,
trust me. We can tell.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.010
Okay, okay, well,
it's time to go anyways.

31:53.012 --> 31:55.913
Andy's tired. He said
his arms are like pudding.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.514
Hey are you almost ready
to go?

31:57.516 --> 31:59.249
<i> -[andy] yeah.</i>
<i> -Okay.</i>

31:59.251 --> 32:01.218
Okay, come up,
you did a great job.

32:01.220 --> 32:05.055
-[brad] see you, chris.
-[chris] all right, yeah.
Grand. Thanks, kris.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.224
-Okay, no problem, man.
-[chris] yeah.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.526
-Okay, later, guys.
-[brad] see you later.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.230
[laughing]

32:14.667 --> 32:16.066
<i> [kris] I mean, really.</i>

32:16.068 --> 32:18.101
With how crappy this season's
going, the last thing

32:18.103 --> 32:20.537
I need to do is share gold
with somebody else.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.539
Sorry, chris,
you're on your own.

32:22.541 --> 32:25.809
-Hey, my favorite brother.
-...It stopped running.

32:27.680 --> 32:28.879
[kris] the only time
we make money

32:28.881 --> 32:31.248
is when we start
sucking up gold.

32:31.250 --> 32:34.318
So we're not in a good mood
90% of the [bleep] time.

32:34.320 --> 32:38.055
But you start throwing some
$100 bills at me, and bam!

32:38.057 --> 32:39.723
I'd make a good stripper.

32:39.725 --> 32:42.492
I'd be so happy
just to strip-- like,
throwin' money at me.

32:42.494 --> 32:43.760
Come on, I'm ready.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.662
[laughs]

32:45.664 --> 32:48.598
[kris] hey, we're on gold.
We needed it.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.001
Thank god it's happening.

32:51.003 --> 32:53.971
<i> [mike] while kris' move</i>
<i>  is paying off big...</i>

32:55.240 --> 32:56.773
<i>  ...A few miles west...</i>

33:04.516 --> 33:06.483
[shawn speaking]

33:15.260 --> 33:17.461
[mike]
<i>  despite promising ground,</i>

33:17.463 --> 33:19.262
<i> shawn has yet to hit pay dirt.</i>

33:44.823 --> 33:46.656
But, no, no...

33:54.666 --> 33:55.632
Oh.

34:03.308 --> 34:04.574
Yes, sir.

34:10.949 --> 34:14.184
<i>  Sometimes you win big,</i>
<i>  sometimes you lose.</i>

34:14.186 --> 34:16.453
That's the risk you take
when you move camp

34:16.455 --> 34:18.422
and try a new hole.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.991
<i>  This time, we struck out.</i>

34:24.163 --> 34:27.164
Shut her down, blow her out,
make a move.

34:27.699 --> 34:28.832
Again.

34:30.169 --> 34:32.736
But my conviction that
there's a jackpot in this hole

34:32.738 --> 34:34.404
hasn't wavered a bit.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.073
<i>  I'm sure of it.</i>

34:36.075 --> 34:39.443
The material I saw today makes
me even more convinced.

34:54.626 --> 34:57.461
[intense music playing]

35:00.165 --> 35:01.331
hello, and welcome
to another episode of

35:01.333 --> 35:03.767
kris kelly's secret
guide to successful mining.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.836
Today we're gonna be
going through
the cleanout process.

35:05.838 --> 35:07.504
How to take your concentrates,

35:07.506 --> 35:09.473
put them through
the super concentrator

35:09.475 --> 35:11.174
and you wind up with gold.

35:14.646 --> 35:16.947
<i>  First step in the process</i>
<i>  is trying to take out</i>

35:16.949 --> 35:20.183
<i>  all the big rocks and just be</i>
<i>  left with the sand.</i>

35:20.185 --> 35:22.319
<i>  Everything that's left over,</i>
<i>  we're going to run through</i>

35:22.321 --> 35:24.521
<i>  the super classifier</i>
<i>  called the gold cube.</i>

35:24.523 --> 35:27.624
<i>  We put that in the gold pan,</i>
<i>  we pan for a couple hours.</i>

35:27.626 --> 35:29.759
<i>  After that stage,</i>
<i>  we have to dry it</i>

35:29.761 --> 35:33.964
<i>  because no gold buyer</i>
<i>  will buy wet gold.</i>

35:33.966 --> 35:37.300
Anyway, the next step
is panning.

35:39.204 --> 35:40.937
Panning, nightmare.

35:40.939 --> 35:44.341
You know, it's like, gold pan,
get punched in the face.

35:44.343 --> 35:47.043
I know there's people
out there that say
they love panning.

35:47.045 --> 35:48.645
But they're lying
to themselves.

35:48.647 --> 35:51.081
Have you ever [bleep] panned
for 10 hours?

35:51.083 --> 35:52.916
Tell me how much
you love panning

35:52.918 --> 35:54.251
after panning for 10 hours.

35:55.154 --> 35:56.686
So this is what you do.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.889
They get the gold
up to the top,

35:58.891 --> 36:01.691
and then slowly rocking,

36:01.693 --> 36:05.362
rocking, rocking some more,
watching the black sands

36:05.364 --> 36:08.398
and material move down while
the gold stays up.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.666
So you're rocking.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.201
You're rocking.

36:11.203 --> 36:14.171
You're rocking,
you're rocking,

36:14.173 --> 36:15.906
then you're rocking some more.

36:15.908 --> 36:18.575
You're going to do that for
about five [bleep] hours.

36:18.577 --> 36:19.809
All day long.

36:19.811 --> 36:23.013
Rocking, rocking, rocking.

36:23.015 --> 36:25.815
Rocking, rocking, rocking,

36:25.817 --> 36:28.952
rocking, rocking, rocking...

36:40.999 --> 36:44.334
That's some nice
clean gold right there.

36:44.336 --> 36:47.070
<i> [mike] after gary simpson's</i>
<i>  miracle dive...</i>

36:47.072 --> 36:49.439
-It's got some serious
weight to it.
-Yeah.

36:49.441 --> 36:52.709
<i>  ...It's time to shed</i>
<i> a little light on the results.</i>

36:52.711 --> 36:55.245
The further we go
following this streak,

36:55.247 --> 36:57.180
the better the gold gets,
but the closer

36:57.182 --> 36:59.416
we're getting to that
open water out there.

36:59.418 --> 37:00.617
-Yeah.
-Um...

37:00.619 --> 37:03.320
So, um, I don't know.

37:03.322 --> 37:05.155
Well, let's see what we got.

37:06.658 --> 37:08.291
[vernon] two, four,

37:09.361 --> 37:11.928
five, six...

37:13.232 --> 37:14.130
Seven...

37:15.267 --> 37:17.567
...Nine, come on, baby.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.470
Thirteen. Oh, wow.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.672
14.73.

37:22.674 --> 37:25.075
-Awesome.
-14.73, I'll take it.

37:25.077 --> 37:26.009
-Yeah.
-I'll take it.

37:26.011 --> 37:28.945
<i> [mike] 14.73 ounces.</i>

37:28.947 --> 37:31.581
<i>  That's worth over $27,000.</i>

37:31.583 --> 37:33.550
<i>  And despite the malfunction</i>
<i>  with the equipment,</i>

37:33.552 --> 37:36.586
<i>  vernon adkison's future</i>
<i>  on claim 56</i>

37:36.588 --> 37:38.455
<i>  continues to look bright.</i>

37:38.457 --> 37:40.557
[vernon] there's definitely
more gold than that.

37:40.559 --> 37:44.027
We're definitely heading
in the right direction.

37:44.029 --> 37:45.795
The only thing about it is,
I mean,

37:45.797 --> 37:47.163
with that open water
out there,

37:47.165 --> 37:49.065
we can only go
so much further.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.734
We continue to be
on super gold

37:50.736 --> 37:53.103
but we've gone as far as
we can on this hole.

37:53.105 --> 37:54.804
We've reached the end
of our hose,

37:54.806 --> 37:56.806
so that means we're going
to have to move straight

37:56.808 --> 38:00.043
<i>  towards that open water</i>
<i>  out there. It's risky.</i>

38:00.045 --> 38:02.312
<i>  One storm could break off</i>
<i>  the ice and do us in.</i>

38:02.314 --> 38:04.281
But by definition,
if you're an ice miner,

38:04.283 --> 38:08.084
you're a risk-taker.
It's a risky business.

38:08.086 --> 38:10.820
Hopefully the ice
holds up for us.

38:11.823 --> 38:13.823
The rest of the winter's
gonna be interesting,

38:13.825 --> 38:15.191
that's for damn sure.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.093
All right, so,
we're in the money.

38:17.095 --> 38:18.995
-Yeah. We're in the money.
-All right, man.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.266
<i> [mike] across town...</i>

38:26.772 --> 38:29.272
[kris] get the last bucket,
we're almost done.

38:29.274 --> 38:31.775
The moment of truth
is upon us.

38:33.845 --> 38:36.379
-[andy]
let's weigh that [bleep].
-Let's see what we got.

38:36.381 --> 38:39.115
Andy said this was the spot
and that was the spot.

38:39.117 --> 38:40.817
Yeah, dad picked the spot.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.453
-No, I'm glad you picked it.
-Dad goes, "no, right here."

38:43.455 --> 38:45.322
dad picked the spot, but
what made me go there was

38:45.324 --> 38:47.157
when you said it was the spot.

38:47.159 --> 38:48.758
You know, 'cause you're
a lucky [bleep].

38:48.760 --> 38:50.493
<i> [mike] it may be the middle</i>
<i>  of the season,</i>

38:50.495 --> 38:52.462
<i>  but it's time for the kellys'</i>

38:52.464 --> 38:54.497
<i>  first clean out of winter.</i>

38:54.499 --> 38:56.299
I just jumped down there
and I find gold

38:56.301 --> 38:57.634
in two inches of over burden.

38:57.636 --> 38:59.602
-I know, isn't that nice?
-You know, like, yeah.

39:00.372 --> 39:02.005
This winter's been horrible,

39:02.007 --> 39:04.240
but it's never too late
to turn it around.

39:04.242 --> 39:07.844
Well, actually, we were like
one second away from
being too late.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.679
<i>  Right now, we owe pat keene</i>
<i>  a lot of money,</i>

39:09.681 --> 39:11.681
<i>  but, hopefully,</i>
<i>  if we get five ounces,</i>

39:11.683 --> 39:13.817
that'll be enough to keep him
off my back

39:13.819 --> 39:17.020
and to make a dent in the 25
ounces that I want to get.

39:17.022 --> 39:19.089
Okay, let's see what we got.

39:20.892 --> 39:23.927
[intense music playing]

39:26.031 --> 39:27.564
there's one ounce.

39:29.267 --> 39:31.801
Two ounces and some more
chunky stuff.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.737
Chunky stuff just raining out.

39:33.739 --> 39:36.005
Now we're getting five.
There's seven...

39:36.007 --> 39:37.140
Oh, my god.

39:38.343 --> 39:40.443
7.7 ounces.

39:40.445 --> 39:43.446
<i> [mike] 7.7 ounces is worth</i>
<i>  over 14 grand,</i>

39:43.448 --> 39:45.982
<i>  finally putting the kellys</i>
<i>  on the board</i>

39:45.984 --> 39:48.218
<i>  and at least temporarily</i>

39:48.220 --> 39:50.286
<i>  keeping the grim reaper</i>
<i>  at bay.</i>

39:50.288 --> 39:52.422
All right, that's really
good money, jake.

39:52.424 --> 39:54.724
[kris] that is [bleep]
awesome money.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.126
It sucks
a lot of this is going

39:56.128 --> 39:58.027
straight into
someone else's pocket.

39:58.029 --> 40:00.930
But we're back baby,
we're back in the game.

40:00.932 --> 40:03.032
<i>  It's a great clean up,</i>
<i>  we're on gold.</i>

40:03.034 --> 40:05.068
Don't worry future
little kelly,

40:05.070 --> 40:07.203
daddy's going to make it
rain the rest of the season.

40:08.607 --> 40:12.208
That's perfect.
It was easy to get,

40:12.210 --> 40:14.778
there's a lot of gold,
now we just need more time.

40:14.780 --> 40:16.646
We just got a lot of work
ahead of us.

40:16.648 --> 40:18.114
We really got to grind it out.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.582
[andy] yeah, it's time to put
the hammer down

40:19.584 --> 40:21.851
and really rip the
[bleep] out of the area.

40:23.288 --> 40:26.156
<i> [mike] next time</i>
<i>  on bering sea gold.</i>

40:26.158 --> 40:28.425
First dive ever,
what could go wrong?

40:28.427 --> 40:30.994
[kris] you can do it, dave!

40:30.996 --> 40:33.129
<i> [shawn] we're close</i>
<i>  to something big</i>

40:33.131 --> 40:35.665
and we're not going to quit
until we find it.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.602
Holy [bleep]!

40:39.604 --> 40:42.172
Got everything moved over here
to the new area

40:42.174 --> 40:44.541
<i>  and we're on that pay streak.</i>

40:44.543 --> 40:47.177
This might end up being
an extremely good hole.

40:51.283 --> 40:53.450
It's sketch.
It's super not ideal.

40:54.252 --> 40:55.618
[gary over radio]

40:55.620 --> 40:58.888
this might be that primo
ground we've been looking for.

40:58.890 --> 41:01.524
[kris] [bleep] let's go. Wind.

41:01.526 --> 41:03.593
[dave] hey, is water
supposed to come

41:03.595 --> 41:05.094
at the bottom of my mask?

41:05.096 --> 41:07.330
<i> [kris] don't worry, as long</i>
<i>  as you're getting gold,</i>

41:07.332 --> 41:08.731
<i>  that's all that matters.</i>

41:08.733 --> 41:09.999
Okay.

41:11.303 --> 41:13.236
You know what makes
the best miners?

41:13.238 --> 41:14.938
When you're too stupid
to [bleep] know

41:14.940 --> 41:16.005
you're in trouble.
