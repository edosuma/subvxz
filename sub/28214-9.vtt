WEBVTT

00:03.525 --> 00:05.179
You know what's going on here?

00:05.353 --> 00:06.789
About my father
raping secretaries?

00:06.963 --> 00:08.791
Yes.

00:08.965 --> 00:10.575
LIZ:
I want you to find out
if there are any more

00:10.749 --> 00:14.492
women that he's raped
in the firm, in the world.

00:14.666 --> 00:17.974
I want to know everything,
so don't bury it.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.891
I heard they fire half of us
in the first month.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.588
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I heard that, too.

00:23.762 --> 00:26.243
[both chuckle]

00:26.417 --> 00:27.940
We should stick together.

00:28.115 --> 00:31.031
Uh, I'm Lili.Maia.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.425
[indistinct radio transmission]

00:34.599 --> 00:36.993
NEWSWOMAN:
They're calling it
the Great Chicago Flood.

00:37.167 --> 00:39.604
Eight inches of rain
in the next 48 hours

00:39.778 --> 00:42.477
will mean this is
the wettest May ever.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.479
And with a cold snap
on the horizon,

00:44.653 --> 00:46.176
we could see a sudden drop
in temperatures

00:46.350 --> 00:48.178
and several freak incidents...

00:48.352 --> 00:50.876
BRIAN:
Look, there was a large puddle
in front of the store.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.095
With bad drainage.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.271
I-It was their fault!

00:55.881 --> 00:57.361
Are you paying attention?

00:57.535 --> 00:59.711
Why are you asking me
to repeat this again?

00:59.885 --> 01:02.497
Because I'm taking
careful notes, Brian.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.586
That's what we do here
at Consult a Lawyer.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.283
Listen to me, it's their fault!

01:06.457 --> 01:08.372
Well, say that again so I can
take my careful notes.

01:08.546 --> 01:10.244
Your commercial...

01:10.418 --> 01:13.377
Maia, I have a very important
legal emergency on line three.

01:13.551 --> 01:15.553
Doesn't sound
like you're caring.

01:17.599 --> 01:19.079
I got two pickles today.
Want one?

01:19.253 --> 01:21.124
Is it sweet?Nope.

01:21.298 --> 01:22.473
Thank you.

01:22.647 --> 01:26.260
Did you see the new guy
in cubicle 784?

01:26.434 --> 01:27.913
He's from our old job.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.090
You're kidding,
from Lockhart/Deckler?

01:30.264 --> 01:32.353
LILI:
Yeah. Roger.
He got fired four months ago.

01:32.527 --> 01:34.964
Said there were only two
people left from our class.

01:35.138 --> 01:37.793
They should have T-shirts
made up for us.

01:37.967 --> 01:39.751
Yeah. Hmm.

01:39.925 --> 01:42.450
They'll all die of heart attacks
and we'll live forever.

01:42.624 --> 01:44.582
[Brian talking indistinctly
over headset]

01:49.544 --> 01:50.893
I'm sorry, Brian,
you were saying?

01:51.067 --> 01:52.808
BRIAN: Listen to me....
Mm-hmm.

01:52.982 --> 01:56.290
Your commercial led me
to believe that you care.

01:56.464 --> 01:57.682
I'm telling you,
it's their fault.

01:57.856 --> 02:00.250
Are you listening?

02:00.424 --> 02:02.948
Oh, my God.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.430
Put that down. Let's go.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.693
Excuse me?

02:08.867 --> 02:11.696
Put down the headset, come on.
This place gives me the creeps.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.524
What do you want, Blum?

02:13.698 --> 02:15.874
I want you to come with me.
Did I not make that clear?

02:16.048 --> 02:18.399
I got a job.
You got me fired.

02:18.573 --> 02:20.401
Yes, and that was
five weeks ago.

02:20.575 --> 02:22.403
Now I want to give you a job.
Keep up.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.187
What job?

02:24.361 --> 02:25.667
[whispering]:
What does it matter?

02:25.841 --> 02:28.626
Exactly. My job is not
in this shithole.

02:29.932 --> 02:31.803
I'm counting to three.

02:31.977 --> 02:33.501
I'll take it.

02:33.675 --> 02:36.025
I'll take it.

02:36.199 --> 02:38.027
SHERYL:
No, I'm here now.

02:38.201 --> 02:40.116
Yes. Yes.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.336
[hail thudding]

02:42.510 --> 02:46.296
Wow. Hail.
Next there'll be frogs.

02:46.470 --> 02:47.732
No, I think
this is right.

02:47.906 --> 02:50.518
Okay. I'll call you back.

02:50.692 --> 02:53.347
Okay, that was Neil.
We have agreed on a plan.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.044
We want to keep working
with your firm.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.960
Good. Uh, we want
that, too.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.179
You're not the biggest
in Chicago,

02:59.353 --> 03:01.050
but we appreciate
your diversity.

03:01.224 --> 03:03.879
Unfortunately, we are living
in a #MeToo world,

03:04.053 --> 03:07.404
and Chumhum has zero tolerance
for sexual coercion these days.

03:07.578 --> 03:10.059
Uh, my father died
two years ago, Ms. Lamore,

03:10.233 --> 03:12.366
and we have addressed
that issue with his victims.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.324
Yes, but you're planning
on going public

03:14.498 --> 03:17.327
with these offenses,
and your bad PR will be ours.

03:17.501 --> 03:20.156
So what do you want us to do?
We want the firm

03:20.330 --> 03:24.508
to finance an investigation on
how it handled these incidents.

03:24.682 --> 03:27.990
This is Brenda Decarlo.
She is a lawyer

03:28.164 --> 03:31.385
specializing in issues
on sexual impropriety.

03:31.559 --> 03:34.475
She investigated the Olympic
track abuse last year.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.825
Hello. [laughing]

03:39.480 --> 03:42.961
We want her to have unfettered
access to your firm.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.964
We need to make sure there are
no remaining cultural issues.

03:46.138 --> 03:48.184
What do you mean
"cultural issues"?

03:48.358 --> 03:50.012
BRENDA:
An environment
that encourages

03:50.186 --> 03:51.840
the culture of fear,
entitlement,

03:52.014 --> 03:53.929
and lack of
accountability.

03:54.103 --> 03:56.148
[laughing]

03:59.804 --> 04:01.458
I'm sorry, I know
that's not funny.

04:01.632 --> 04:02.764
I have PBA,

04:02.938 --> 04:04.896
pseudobulbar affect.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.507
These are cards
explaining it.

04:06.681 --> 04:09.379
Hmm. Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.425
Is this investigation
really necessary?

04:11.599 --> 04:13.905
SHERYL:
When you go public,
we want to point to a record

04:14.079 --> 04:15.733
giving you a clean
bill of health,

04:15.907 --> 04:20.172
so, yes, if you want to keep us
as a client, it is necessary.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.784
[hail thuds]
[gasps]

04:22.958 --> 04:24.873
No one's condemning anyone.

04:25.047 --> 04:27.136
We just want to get a read
on the culture here

04:27.310 --> 04:28.964
at Reddick, Boseman, Lockhart.

04:29.138 --> 04:32.097
Now, Ms. Decarlo here will be
pulling you all aside,

04:32.272 --> 04:34.622
asking some questions,
just getting a sense

04:34.796 --> 04:37.015
of how we operate.

04:37.189 --> 04:40.149
You can be as candid with her
as you would be with us.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.499
More, actually.
[laughter]

04:42.673 --> 04:44.980
[Brenda continues laughing]
ADRIAN: So I want to say

04:45.154 --> 04:50.768
thank you to you for the best
year this law firm has had.

04:50.942 --> 04:53.728
More clients,
more billable hours.

04:53.902 --> 04:57.471
And that is because of each
and every one of you all.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.647
Thank you.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.440
So what do you think?
God, she's a nut,

05:10.614 --> 05:12.486
but we have a gun
to our head, you know?

05:12.660 --> 05:14.575
[phone chimes]

05:14.749 --> 05:16.577
Wait, Liz.

05:17.795 --> 05:19.754
LIZ: What's that?
It's an emergency.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.930
What's the emergency?

05:22.104 --> 05:25.063
I-I don't know.

05:25.237 --> 05:28.066
Are you going?
Yes, are you?

05:28.240 --> 05:30.286
No. I'm done.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.160
Be careful.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.119
No.

05:37.293 --> 05:39.121
ROLAND:
What do you mean "no"?

05:39.295 --> 05:41.428
MAIA:
You know, I thought
you were pulling me out of hell,

05:41.602 --> 05:43.995
but I think you're just
dragging me deeper.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.867
Look, I'm months behind
in billing.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.696
There are counsel fee awards
I haven't collected...

05:48.870 --> 05:50.219
You don't need
an attorney for that.

05:50.393 --> 05:52.221
I need someone I can trust.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.617
Someone competent.
Annunciata.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.445
MAIA:
I don't want to be your

05:58.619 --> 06:01.448
office manager, okay? Or someone
relegated to bill collecting.

06:01.622 --> 06:04.189
Well, I don't
want that either.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.192
You know, I got Spencer Marsh
coming in tomorrow.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.760
The CEO?
Yup.

06:09.934 --> 06:13.547
Oh, he thinks your father
was a great man.

06:13.721 --> 06:16.985
[chuckles]
Ah, my father.

06:17.159 --> 06:18.552
See, that's why you want me.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.380
No, it's 'cause of your
sunny disposition.

06:20.554 --> 06:22.469
Of course that's why I want you.

06:22.643 --> 06:24.079
Or would you rather be liked

06:24.253 --> 06:26.516
or needed? And if you
don't say "needed,"

06:26.690 --> 06:28.649
I'm kicking you
right out of here.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.175
Okay, here's what we need to do.

06:33.349 --> 06:37.919
You need a real office
in a real building in the Loop.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.921
Spencer, he won't even
enter a room like this.

06:40.095 --> 06:43.272
Okay. How much?

06:43.446 --> 06:44.926
What it costs?
Mm-hmm.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.667
[inhales]

06:46.841 --> 06:49.539
I'll work with an initial budget
of 55 grand a month

06:49.713 --> 06:51.106
to get your office
up and running.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.979
[laughs] No. No, no, no, no.
Way too much.

06:55.153 --> 06:57.547
It's what a real office costs,
you know.

06:57.721 --> 07:00.898
I saw what you charged
Avery Ward. You can afford it.

07:01.072 --> 07:04.293
Oh, you have an evil look
in your eye.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.774
It's what I look like
these days.

07:08.819 --> 07:10.386
$45,000 a month.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.433
That's your budget.
50.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.610
[spits]

07:17.654 --> 07:19.221
[spits]

07:19.395 --> 07:20.788
[phone ringing]

07:24.792 --> 07:26.402
Thank you for calling
Consult a Lawyer.

07:26.576 --> 07:29.927
This is Lili. Please tell me
a little about your issue.

07:30.101 --> 07:32.582
MAIA: Lili, shut up, it's Maia.
Maia?

07:32.756 --> 07:33.670
What are you doing?
[Roland moaning]

07:33.844 --> 07:34.671
Opening an office.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.107
I need you to quit.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.936
Quit what?
Your job.

07:39.110 --> 07:42.723
Join me at a new firm
I'm forming. I'll pay double.

07:42.897 --> 07:45.552
I have another pickle
from my sandwich.

07:45.726 --> 07:46.988
Do you want me to bring it?

07:47.162 --> 07:49.164
Sure.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.302
RACHELLE [whispering]:
Diane.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.740
Where's Liz?

07:59.914 --> 08:02.438
She's not coming.

08:02.612 --> 08:05.310
Why?

08:05.485 --> 08:06.398
She's done.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.618
Do you think it's her?

08:08.792 --> 08:09.880
No, her profile
came up clean.

08:10.054 --> 08:11.142
That doesn't
mean anything.

08:11.316 --> 08:12.970
We don't know what she could do.

08:13.144 --> 08:14.537
What are you talking about?

08:14.711 --> 08:16.017
"Watch out for traitors.

08:16.191 --> 08:17.671
There are people
who want to stop us."

08:17.845 --> 08:20.151
Who's that from?
RACHELLE: Valerie.

08:20.325 --> 08:21.631
We asked her how
the hack got stopped.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.024
That's what
she wrote back.

08:23.198 --> 08:25.113
ISABELLA:
"This is my suggestion.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.245
"We need to revert
to fuller measures.

08:27.419 --> 08:29.552
That's the only way to educate
the White House."

08:29.726 --> 08:31.162
What does that mean,
fuller measures?

08:31.336 --> 08:32.381
"I would suggest
our first target:

08:32.555 --> 08:34.383
"Michael Tyrek.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.167
"He's the designer
of the border strategy,

08:36.341 --> 08:38.300
"and he's currently
responsible for the death

08:38.474 --> 08:39.910
"of three children
in El Paso cages.

08:40.084 --> 08:41.782
He must be stopped."

08:41.956 --> 08:44.524
I'm sorry, but what,
what are fuller measures?

08:44.698 --> 08:46.264
Swatting him.

08:46.438 --> 08:48.136
Calling 911, telling them

08:48.310 --> 08:49.964
that there's a masked intruder
in Michael Tyrek's house.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.356
Oh, my God.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.228
Giving him some
of what he gave

08:53.402 --> 08:55.317
those kids at the border.
Three children died.

08:55.491 --> 08:58.015
One from dehydration,
some from neglect.

08:58.189 --> 09:01.018
That doesn't mean it's right.
I mean, swatting?

09:01.192 --> 09:02.585
ISABELLA:
Why doesn't it?

09:02.759 --> 09:04.021
Because he could get killed.

09:04.195 --> 09:05.414
Like he killed
those kids?

09:05.588 --> 09:06.676
Shh.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.548
DIANE:
Look, I'm not defending Tyrek,

09:08.722 --> 09:11.028
but these tactics
are seriously wrong.

09:11.202 --> 09:13.074
Not according to Valerie.

09:15.598 --> 09:18.035
Okay. That is not
a text from Valerie.

09:18.209 --> 09:20.342
What do you mean?

09:23.388 --> 09:27.523
Valerie is not who
she said she was.

09:27.697 --> 09:32.093
She is a con woman who
started this resistance

09:32.267 --> 09:33.834
so she could take our money.

09:34.008 --> 09:37.011
She is currently
in Rikers.

09:37.185 --> 09:40.188
And I have to admit,
I-I made up her first text

09:40.362 --> 09:42.233
because I thought this group
was doing good work,

09:42.407 --> 09:44.235
and I didn't want us
to disband.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.759
I'm sorry, what?

09:45.933 --> 09:49.676
I pretended
that Valerie was real,

09:49.850 --> 09:51.939
so we could continue
the resistance.

09:52.113 --> 09:54.463
Then why do I have
a text from her?
Because it's not

09:54.637 --> 09:56.770
a text from her.
You made that up.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.728
I had my investigator

09:58.902 --> 10:01.601
check on that number.
It is your number,

10:01.775 --> 10:03.472
and you sent it
to yourself.

10:03.646 --> 10:06.301
[overlapping arguing]

10:06.475 --> 10:09.304
Hey, hey, hey.
Can I interrupt for a sec?

10:09.478 --> 10:11.915
Valerie warned us that someone
would try to break us up,

10:12.089 --> 10:13.134
and that's what she's doing.

10:13.308 --> 10:14.352
No.
Yes.

10:14.526 --> 10:15.615
She's saying
exactly the things

10:15.789 --> 10:17.486
to get us to
distrust ourselves.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.532
I agree. We're not
the enemies here.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.970
The enemy
is Michael Tyrek.
Diane,

10:23.144 --> 10:25.363
at the very minimum,
what you're admitting

10:25.537 --> 10:27.714
is that you lied.
Why do we trust you now?

10:27.888 --> 10:29.150
If I have evidence...

10:29.324 --> 10:31.152
If you have evidence,
let's see it.

10:33.154 --> 10:35.199
Fine.

10:36.418 --> 10:38.159
Hey, Jay.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.988
Do you still have that material
on Valerie Underwood?

10:41.162 --> 10:42.903
JAY:
The con woman in Rikers? Yes.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.296
Can you get me
the research on her?

10:45.470 --> 10:47.037
Sure. I'll put it on your desk.

10:47.211 --> 10:48.865
Good, and if you have
a mug shot,

10:49.039 --> 10:51.128
that would be,
that would be helpful.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.740
Yeah, no problem.
BRENDA:
Today is about transparency

10:53.914 --> 10:55.959
and honesty in a safe space,

10:56.133 --> 10:58.353
and I just want you to know,

10:58.527 --> 11:01.225
none of what we say here
is gonna go any further.

11:01.399 --> 11:03.140
This is just for my edification.

11:03.314 --> 11:06.404
All right, so let's do
our first question.

11:06.578 --> 11:09.233
Do any of you have any knowledge
of other employees

11:09.407 --> 11:11.279
who were subject
to sexual coercion

11:11.453 --> 11:14.108
by Carl Reddick or any coworker?

11:15.936 --> 11:17.111
Okay.

11:17.285 --> 11:19.504
This is
a bit broader question now.

11:19.679 --> 11:23.683
Have any of you been harassed
by anyone at this firm?

11:23.857 --> 11:27.208
Well, are-are we
only talking sex?

11:27.382 --> 11:29.210
Not necessarily. Why?

11:29.384 --> 11:30.907
Well, I mean, it's not sexual,

11:31.081 --> 11:32.822
but this firm definitely has
a lot of racial issues.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.998
Oh, come on,
are you kidding me?

11:35.172 --> 11:36.870
No, I'm not.
What would you describe it as?
Okay, I don't think

11:37.044 --> 11:38.567
that's what the
report is about.

11:38.741 --> 11:39.611
She asked the question.
So you want us to just shut up?

11:39.786 --> 11:41.526
Isn't that part of the problem?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.180
Okay, wait, l-let's go back.

11:43.354 --> 11:44.921
What are the racial issues
you're talking about?

11:45.095 --> 11:47.402
You were paid. All of you
associates got money.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.230
Because they're trying
to pay us off.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.449
The partners want us to shut up.
Exactly.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.669
That's why they gave us
the bonuses.
That was the agreement.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.105
[overlapping chatter]

11:55.279 --> 11:57.891
Uh, okay, so why were you paid?

11:58.065 --> 12:00.197
We were paid
one-time bonuses.
To shut us up.

12:00.371 --> 12:03.244
Okay, so let's talk about that.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.032
Thank you.

12:10.338 --> 12:13.820
Wow. I like the smell.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.256
I do, too.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.040
REALTOR:
If you like it, I'd snap it up.

12:17.214 --> 12:19.869
I have a start-up
circling.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.566
Does it come with the furniture?

12:21.741 --> 12:24.004
It can. I'll need
a six-month commitment.

12:24.178 --> 12:26.223
When can we move in?

12:26.397 --> 12:30.140
You sign the papers,
you could be in today.

12:30.314 --> 12:33.274
How tall are you?
Me? Six foot.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.842
You should be my secretary.
I need a secretary.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.408
REALTOR:
Let me think about it.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.193
Can I feel your arm?
Yes.

12:41.543 --> 12:42.587
I want this place.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.504
Okay. Okay.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.593
We want it.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.596
[arguing continues]

12:51.771 --> 12:54.382
Look, as a man,

12:54.556 --> 12:56.993
I acknowledge sexual
harassment is a problem.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.995
Oh, thank you. As a man?

12:59.169 --> 13:00.431
We appreciate you
recognizing that.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.651
Oh, my God,
I'm on your side here.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.305
Really? You're on our side?
You're against rape?

13:04.479 --> 13:05.393
Wow. Thank you.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.177
I mean,
I-I appreciate it.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.613
I'm just saying there are
other problems here, too.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.137
And what are they?

13:10.311 --> 13:12.008
Number one:
men weren't even considered

13:12.182 --> 13:13.923
to head up Matrimonial Affairs.

13:14.097 --> 13:16.665
Uh, hold on, you're attacking
my department now?

13:16.839 --> 13:20.103
We have two female name partners
who are biased against men.

13:20.277 --> 13:21.888
Ugh, wow, yes, please educate us

13:22.062 --> 13:23.498
about the perils
of the working man.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.152
You're in no place to criticize.

13:25.326 --> 13:27.371
You're basically
stealing Jay's job.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.765
What? I'm not stealing his job.
That's what
I'm talking about.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.419
Women have
an inside track here.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.638
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That is not a gender thing,

13:33.813 --> 13:35.684
that is a race thing.
JIMMY:
What about class disparity?

13:35.858 --> 13:38.165
That's right. This place
is divided along racial lines.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.254
No, it isn't. The mail room
didn't see a cent

13:40.428 --> 13:41.472
of the bonuses y'all got.

13:41.646 --> 13:43.170
Yeah, but that's
because of race.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.346
No. [scoffs] You don't
even know my name, do you?

13:45.520 --> 13:47.565
What does that have
to do with this?

13:47.739 --> 13:49.916
When you need our support,
it's black power,

13:50.090 --> 13:52.570
but when we need your support,
you don't even see us.

13:52.744 --> 13:53.876
Oh, okay...
That is absolute truth.

13:54.050 --> 13:55.008
Don't even debate about that.

13:55.182 --> 13:57.184
[overlapping arguing]

13:59.534 --> 14:00.665
You got a minute?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.189
Sure.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.933
This investigator is supposed
to interview us all tomorrow.

14:07.107 --> 14:08.717
Okay.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.458
So just be honest.
You'll be fine.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.547
One of her questions was,
"Do you have knowledge

14:12.721 --> 14:14.766
of other victims
of Mr. Reddick's coercion?"

14:14.941 --> 14:16.856
Well, that makes sense.

14:19.206 --> 14:21.121
That folder I gave you,

14:21.295 --> 14:22.687
the investigation
into the other women.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.733
I know, I, uh...

14:24.907 --> 14:26.604
I still haven't read it.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.432
I will.

14:28.606 --> 14:31.218
Uh... in the meantime...

14:31.392 --> 14:33.002
Nothing to Brenda?

14:33.176 --> 14:34.482
For now.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.266
Okay.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.746
Oh, Marissa.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.574
Are there any other copies
of that report?

14:39.748 --> 14:40.923
No.

14:41.097 --> 14:43.578
My notes, but that's it.Okay.

14:43.752 --> 14:46.320
Good. We'll talk tomorrow.
Thanks.

14:46.494 --> 14:48.365
[door opens]

14:48.539 --> 14:50.411
[door closes]

14:50.585 --> 14:52.587
[taps desk]

14:53.936 --> 14:55.242
[light knock on door]

14:55.416 --> 14:57.722
Liz.
Yeah?

14:57.897 --> 14:59.724
The, uh, investigator
has a question for us.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.335
Yeah.
[clears throat]

15:01.509 --> 15:03.206
Uh, just a quick question.
I think it's best

15:03.380 --> 15:06.035
to address this together--
Please. Hi.

15:06.209 --> 15:07.515
Hi.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.212
Is it going well downstairs?

15:09.386 --> 15:11.432
Oh, it's going... fascinating.

15:11.606 --> 15:13.086
Well, that's...

15:13.260 --> 15:15.436
not the word I
was expecting.
[laughs]

15:15.610 --> 15:18.265
So, as part of my investigation,

15:18.439 --> 15:21.833
I've perused company e-mails...
[stifled laugh]

15:22.008 --> 15:22.922
[giggles]

15:23.096 --> 15:24.401
Mm.

15:24.575 --> 15:25.881
[sharp exhale]

15:26.055 --> 15:27.709
[sniffs]
And it's come to my attention

15:27.883 --> 15:29.537
that I would like
to ask you about

15:29.711 --> 15:31.060
two specific
communications.

15:32.757 --> 15:35.108
They were sent...

15:35.282 --> 15:36.979
between you two...

15:37.153 --> 15:39.025
um, and they reference,

15:39.199 --> 15:41.549
uh, an inappropriate
relationship

15:41.723 --> 15:44.247
that it's "best
no one know about."

15:44.421 --> 15:46.249
Simple question.

15:46.423 --> 15:48.686
What's the relationship
you're referencing?

15:51.689 --> 15:52.908
Um...

15:53.082 --> 15:56.738
And a year ago,
you say right there,

15:56.912 --> 15:59.306
um... "It's over.

15:59.480 --> 16:02.396
It was a one-time thing.
No one needs to know."

16:03.963 --> 16:06.052
It's about Carl, clearly.

16:06.226 --> 16:08.184
Yeah.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.578
Right.

16:10.752 --> 16:13.842
Except it was sent three months
after Mr. Reddick's death.

16:14.016 --> 16:16.888
And eight months before,
Ms. Reddick,

16:17.063 --> 16:19.543
you were told about your
father's inappropriate actions.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.458
You know, you know what?

16:21.632 --> 16:23.504
I think, I think this was about

16:23.678 --> 16:25.506
a relationship
between two peers

16:25.680 --> 16:27.290
here at the firm.

16:27.464 --> 16:28.291
BRENDA:Good.Yeah.

16:28.465 --> 16:29.814
Which two peers?

16:29.989 --> 16:33.122
We've agreed
to not divulge their names.

16:33.296 --> 16:36.299
I won't divulge
their names, either.

16:36.473 --> 16:38.432
I just need to know
that it was consensual

16:38.606 --> 16:42.131
between two peers.
I-It was consensual.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.704
Oh.

16:49.878 --> 16:52.402
It was between you two.

16:52.576 --> 16:53.969
Okay.

16:54.143 --> 16:55.579
Hmm.

16:55.753 --> 16:58.539
Uh, it-- [exhales]

16:58.713 --> 17:00.584
It was a moment of weakness.

17:00.758 --> 17:03.239
It was a one-time thing.

17:03.413 --> 17:05.067
Mm-hmm.
I was recuperating

17:05.241 --> 17:08.114
from a gunshot injury.
Liz was there.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.942
Yeah, but as I said,
it was consensual,

17:11.117 --> 17:14.729
and we are both
name partners at the firm.

17:14.903 --> 17:18.167
So... we would like to avoid
any embarrassment

17:18.341 --> 17:21.866
by not including it
in the report.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.433
Agreed.Yeah.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.392
It doesn't fall under
my original purview.

17:25.566 --> 17:26.480
Good.Um...

17:26.654 --> 17:28.134
Thank you.
But...

17:28.308 --> 17:31.615
you both testified in court

17:31.789 --> 17:34.575
that there was no sexual...

17:34.749 --> 17:35.967
contact...

17:36.142 --> 17:38.144
between you.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.276
So...

17:40.450 --> 17:42.887
that's...

17:43.062 --> 17:44.715
perjury.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.893
[clears throat]

17:49.068 --> 17:50.591
[stammers]

17:52.636 --> 17:54.421
Is perjury part of your mission?

17:54.595 --> 17:56.466
No.

17:57.554 --> 17:59.382
Not originally.
LIZ:So...

17:59.556 --> 18:01.689
then there's no need
to pursue it.

18:01.863 --> 18:04.039
[laughing]

18:09.436 --> 18:11.568
[sharp breaths]

18:11.742 --> 18:13.570
Thank you.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.485
Hmm. [clears throat]

18:15.659 --> 18:17.618
[door opens]

18:19.663 --> 18:21.143

Doesn't matter.

I already committed you

20:39.238 --> 20:41.762
I got to spend six
months in here?

You don't have to spend
six minutes in here, Roland,

I don't like the smell.

I don't like the
decor, the view,

21:10.225 --> 21:12.271

fuck that is...
That's called a desk.

don't care about these children

What do I do?

43:18.944 --> 43:20.467
You're sure it was them?

43:20.641 --> 43:22.469
They were talking
about swatting him.

43:22.643 --> 43:25.341
I could have stopped them,
but I...

43:25.515 --> 43:26.995
Oh, my God, I didn't.

43:27.169 --> 43:31.434
I-I think I must secretly
have wanted it to happen.

43:31.609 --> 43:33.045
You didn't want him dead.

43:33.219 --> 43:35.743
They didn't either.

43:35.917 --> 43:38.703
Do you think they'll
do this again?

43:38.877 --> 43:42.228
Diane, you have to report them.

43:42.402 --> 43:43.621
No.

43:43.795 --> 43:46.101
What if someone else dies?
Liz,

43:46.275 --> 43:49.931
we are tied to them.
Do you understand?

43:50.105 --> 43:51.803
No one will believe that
we're innocent of this.

43:51.977 --> 43:55.763
Then-then you need to show them
that it was all a lie.

43:55.937 --> 43:58.374
Valerie, everything.

44:00.376 --> 44:02.465
POLLY DEAN:
We're deciding what next.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.859
We're wondering if we should
go after his chief of staff.

44:05.033 --> 44:08.341
No. Absolutely not.
You cannot do this.

44:08.515 --> 44:09.603
Did you see
the news?

44:09.777 --> 44:11.605
They're taking
it seriously.

44:11.779 --> 44:13.085
They're taking killing
a man seriously.

44:13.259 --> 44:14.739
They're not taking
the cause seriously.

44:14.913 --> 44:16.566
RACHELLE:
Yes, they are.

44:16.741 --> 44:20.179
Did you watch MSNBC? It's about
killing begetting killing.

44:20.353 --> 44:22.050
It's exactly the point
we wanted to make.

44:22.224 --> 44:24.836
Stop it. Everyone, stop it.

44:25.010 --> 44:28.796
This is a lie. Here.
Valerie brought us together

44:28.970 --> 44:30.755
to steal our money.
There is proof.

44:30.929 --> 44:32.670
She is a liar.

44:32.844 --> 44:35.150
She is a swindler.

44:35.324 --> 44:38.980
It doesn't matter, Diane.
We're way past that.

44:39.154 --> 44:42.767
We're past polls. We're past
favorability ratings

44:42.941 --> 44:44.725
and precincts and
voting machines.

44:44.899 --> 44:47.728
They're conducting war against
us, against their citizens.

44:47.902 --> 44:49.034
POLLY DEAN:
These are the
rules of warfare.

44:49.208 --> 44:50.818
This is not warfare.

44:50.992 --> 44:52.341
ISABELLA:
You two have never been

44:52.515 --> 44:55.562
100% committed, not even
from the beginning.

44:55.736 --> 44:56.911
We know about your husband.

44:57.085 --> 45:00.828
Working in the V.A.
We know who you are.

45:01.002 --> 45:02.656
We're not gonna let you get
anybody else killed.

45:02.830 --> 45:05.180
[laughs]
It's not up to you.

45:05.354 --> 45:07.966
We'll see.

45:12.927 --> 45:15.887
You two are just
as culpable.

45:20.587 --> 45:22.676
I need you
to testify.

45:22.850 --> 45:24.243
No.

45:24.417 --> 45:26.593
You'd be testifying
to the truth.
No.

45:26.767 --> 45:28.203
The truth is
you suborned perjury.

45:28.377 --> 45:30.510
I tried to stop you,
and Boseman tried to stop you.

45:30.684 --> 45:31.685
That's not the truth.
Blum.

45:31.859 --> 45:34.732
Maia, listen to me.

45:34.906 --> 45:37.517
The truth is what
you make it.

45:37.691 --> 45:42.435
You build the facts into the
truth that serves your purpose.

45:42.609 --> 45:43.915
If it stops serving
your purpose,

45:44.089 --> 45:45.655
you rebuild it
into something else.

45:45.830 --> 45:48.615
That's what keeps you
from being a slave

45:48.789 --> 45:50.225
to how people
define you.

45:50.399 --> 45:52.575
That's how you become
your own person.

45:52.750 --> 45:55.143
You define what truth is.

45:55.317 --> 45:58.886
Now, this committee
is gonna disbar me

45:59.060 --> 46:02.107
unless Reddick/Boseman
backs off. The truth is,

46:02.281 --> 46:05.327
my fate

46:05.501 --> 46:07.503
and the fate of this firm

46:07.677 --> 46:10.158
is in your hands.

46:16.121 --> 46:18.514
Where you going?
Home.

46:18.688 --> 46:21.691
I need you in the committee
tomorrow at noon.

46:26.087 --> 46:27.523
[sniffs]

46:34.661 --> 46:35.705
So...

46:35.880 --> 46:38.665
are we gonna talk about it?

46:38.839 --> 46:42.669
Adrian, we have so many things
that we could talk about,

46:42.843 --> 46:44.802
I have no idea
where to even start.

46:47.848 --> 46:52.026
Um... us.

46:53.201 --> 46:55.203
What part of us?

47:00.165 --> 47:02.602
As I remember,
we told each other

47:02.776 --> 47:05.344
that it was a mistake and that
it would never happen again.

47:05.518 --> 47:08.434
And that mistake is about
to appear in a report

47:08.608 --> 47:10.915
handed over to Chumhum
and all the partners.

47:11.089 --> 47:12.873
We don't know that.
We know that the investigator

47:13.047 --> 47:15.049
is thorough. We know that we
just talked about coming clean.

47:15.223 --> 47:19.837
Adrian, I just want
this small portion

47:20.011 --> 47:24.711
of my life not
to be public, okay?

47:24.885 --> 47:26.278
Just this much.

47:27.453 --> 47:29.498
Okay.

47:30.499 --> 47:32.545
Okay.

47:35.287 --> 47:37.898
Liz.

47:38.072 --> 47:39.291
You regret it?

47:39.465 --> 47:41.119
What?

47:47.168 --> 47:48.735
Fucking.

47:48.909 --> 47:51.564
[sighs]

47:51.738 --> 47:52.957
What do you want to hear?

47:53.131 --> 47:55.394
Oh, Jesus.

47:55.568 --> 47:57.004
Forget it.
No-no, I'm serious, I'm serious.

47:57.178 --> 47:58.919
What do you want to hear?
I said forget it, Liz.

47:59.093 --> 48:01.095
Okay.

48:06.100 --> 48:09.712
No. I don't regret it.

48:11.540 --> 48:13.542
Me neither.

48:14.587 --> 48:17.372
But it was once.

48:17.546 --> 48:19.157
Just once.

48:22.247 --> 48:23.857
Yeah.

48:28.862 --> 48:31.386
Night, Liz.Night.

49:43.719 --> 49:46.026
Anything you'd like
to add, Brenda?

49:46.200 --> 49:48.246
The firm is
dysfunctional,

49:48.420 --> 49:50.117
but it's not about
the sexual issues.

49:50.291 --> 49:53.947
It's struggling with
its recent growth spurt,

49:54.121 --> 49:57.255

together to correct that.

49:57.429 --> 49:59.997

actions?

50:00.171 --> 50:01.520
They are regrettable,

50:01.694 --> 50:04.653

cause a loss of faith

Mr. Kreutzer.

51:02.233 --> 51:03.451
Oh, you wish.

51:03.625 --> 51:05.192
The panel has reached
a determination.

51:05.366 --> 51:08.500
If you have further evidence,
we'll hear it in appeal.

51:08.674 --> 51:11.416
Mr. Blum, suborning perjury
is a serious offense.

51:11.590 --> 51:14.027
Mr. Arthur Garber never worked
in the insurance business.

Well, then he fooled me as well.
I-I am shocked.

51:16.725 --> 51:19.163
We're recommending the censure
of Reddick/Boseman

Mr. Kreutzer.

Oh, you're full of shit.
Hold on, Blum.

51:28.085 --> 51:30.739
We're also recommending
that you be disbarred.
