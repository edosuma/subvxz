00:56.456 --> 00:57.684
Come on!

02:21.107 --> 02:23.837
But you realize
I know nothing about politics?

02:23.977 --> 02:26.377
- You voted for him, didn't you?
- Adam Lang? Of course I did.

02:26.446 --> 02:29.745
Everyone voted for him.
He wasn't a politician, he was a craze.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.147
Well, there you go.

02:31.217 --> 02:35.779
Look, it's a new ghostwriter he needs,
not another goddamn politico.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.989
He was paid $10 million for these memoirs,

02:39.058 --> 02:42.027
but rumor has it
the manuscript's a crock of shit.

02:42.095 --> 02:45.258
Rhinehart's lending him his house
at the ocean so they can fix it,

02:45.431 --> 02:48.059
and the pressure
must have gotten to McAra.

02:48.401 --> 02:50.801
Pathologist said his blood was,
like, three parts booze.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.929
You mean he drowned by accident?

02:53.173 --> 02:56.574
Accident, suicide, who cares?
It was the book that killed him.

02:56.809 --> 02:57.901
Well, that's encouraging.

02:59.145 --> 03:00.840
Who is this McAra?
Should I have heard of him?

03:00.914 --> 03:04.907
Yeah. He was some kind of aide to Lang
when he was Prime Minister,

03:04.984 --> 03:07.851
so don't admit that you haven't.
He was with him for years.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.586
I don't know, Rick.

03:15.495 --> 03:18.157
This is a great opportunity for you.

03:18.331 --> 03:20.299
Plus the money is good. Kids won't starve.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.266
- I don't have any kids.
- I do.

03:36.849 --> 03:37.941
Roy.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.818
Who're you expecting to bomb you,
Random House?

03:43.890 --> 03:45.289
We're publishing Lang's memoirs.

03:45.358 --> 03:47.986
That's enough to make us a target,
apparently.

03:48.595 --> 03:49.960
Thank you.

03:59.239 --> 04:03.073
- How many have you seen?
- Five. You're the last.

04:10.683 --> 04:11.911
I must be honest.

04:11.985 --> 04:14.146
I don't think you're the right man
for this assignment.

04:14.220 --> 04:15.983
Then it's a good job
it's not your decision, Roy.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.685
John Maddox, chief executive
of Rhinehart, New York.

04:21.761 --> 04:22.750
Sir.

04:24.063 --> 04:26.554
Sidney Kroll,
Mr. Lang's Washington attorney.

04:26.633 --> 04:27.622
Mr. Kroll.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.692
And Nick Ricardelli I believe you know.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.059
All right, Rick.

04:36.042 --> 04:39.273
All right, I gather from Rick
you're aware of the situation?

04:40.713 --> 04:42.112
Perhaps you can enlighten us

04:42.181 --> 04:45.309
and tell us what exactly
you're gonna bring to this project.

04:45.418 --> 04:46.646
Nothing.

04:49.088 --> 04:51.283
No, I'm not gonna pretend
to be someone I'm not.

04:51.357 --> 04:52.847
You have my CV.

04:52.925 --> 04:56.224
His last effort was
the autobiography of a magician,

04:56.296 --> 04:58.560
<i>I Came, I Sawed, I Conquered.</i>

04:58.631 --> 05:01.361
Yeah, and it went straight
to number one, so...

05:01.434 --> 05:03.595
After you turned it down, Roy.

05:04.137 --> 05:08.233
Look, I don't read political memoirs.
Who does?

05:09.475 --> 05:13.070
And I gather you've spent
$10 million on this book.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.709
How much of that are you gonna see back?

05:15.782 --> 05:17.909
Two? Three?

05:17.984 --> 05:20.248
It's bad news for your shareholders.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.312
And it's worse news
for your client, Mr. Kroll.

05:23.389 --> 05:28.088
Adam Lang, he wants a place in history,
not in the remainder tables.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.253
Oh, please!

05:29.329 --> 05:31.524
It's because I know nothing about politics

05:31.597 --> 05:35.294
that I'll ask the questions that get
right to the heart of who Adam Lang is.

05:35.468 --> 05:37.834
And that is what sells autobiographies.

05:38.438 --> 05:39.632
Heart.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.975
Wow! That's nicely done.

05:44.043 --> 05:46.671
- What utter balls.
- You think so?

05:46.746 --> 05:50.443
John, of course.
Adam Lang's a world historical figure.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.984
His autobiography is gonna be
a world-publishing event.

05:53.052 --> 05:55.782
Yeah, well, I got warehouses filled with

05:55.855 --> 05:58.517
world-publishing events
waiting to be pulped.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.185
Sid?

06:01.961 --> 06:05.863
Adam is obviously still very upset
by what happened to Mike McAra.

06:05.932 --> 06:10.301
He was irreplaceable.
Irreplaceable, and yet he has to be replaced.

06:11.371 --> 06:15.865
Adam can certainly appreciate the benefits
of trying someone different.

06:15.942 --> 06:19.139
In the end, it's about chemistry.
Do you work out, maybe?

06:19.212 --> 06:21.646
- Not really.
- That's a pity. Adam likes to work out.

06:21.714 --> 06:25.206
Actually, I know a good writer
on the <i>Guardian</i> who uses a gym.

06:26.986 --> 06:31.548
Okay, maybe we could just run over
the publishing schedule, yeah?

06:31.624 --> 06:33.057
We need to wrap this up in a month.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.354
- A month?
- Yes.

06:34.427 --> 06:36.588
- You want the book in a month?
- We already have a first draft.

06:36.662 --> 06:39.290
Yeah, well, it needs a lot of work.

06:39.899 --> 06:44.233
That's why I like your résumé here.
You're fast, and you deliver.

06:44.303 --> 06:47.101
You name it, he ghosts it.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.705
And you're a Brit.

06:49.675 --> 06:50.869
The ghost should be a Brit.

06:50.943 --> 06:53.070
To get the jolly old tone right, right?

06:54.580 --> 06:58.539
- Do you have any family commitments?
- No, I have no family. Why?

06:58.618 --> 07:00.347
Adam is locked into a US lecture tour,

07:00.420 --> 07:04.481
also a fundraising program
for the Adam Lang Foundation.

07:04.557 --> 07:06.650
It's a month in the States. That's okay.

07:06.726 --> 07:08.694
Couldn't I bring the manuscript back here
to work on?

07:08.761 --> 07:13.130
I'm afraid not. It's in a secure environment
in Marty Rhinehart's own house.

07:13.399 --> 07:15.560
Only a few people are allowed to handle it.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.193
Sounds more like a bomb than a book.

07:19.205 --> 07:23.471
I will need to see it myself at some point.
I am supposed to be editing it.

07:23.543 --> 07:26.979
Yeah, in theory.
Actually, we need to talk about that.

07:29.015 --> 07:30.846
- How soon can you get over there?
- As soon as you want.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.043
- He'll fly tonight.
- Rick.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.107
It's okay.

07:41.093 --> 07:42.526
Okay, you're in.

07:43.930 --> 07:44.919
Oh!

07:45.031 --> 07:47.056
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thanks.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.532
- Rick.
- Thank you.

07:48.601 --> 07:51.263
Actually, I have something here

07:51.337 --> 07:52.531
- you might want to look at.
- Is that... Is that...

07:52.605 --> 07:55.403
No, no, no, this isn't Adam's book.
No, it's another client of mine.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.909
Yeah, perhaps you can let me know
what you think.

07:59.278 --> 08:00.370
Sure.

08:00.446 --> 08:02.243
Okay, if you're gonna get
that evening flight,

08:02.315 --> 08:04.749
we'd better talk contracts with Rick here.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.615
Wanna show our friend to the door?
Would you?

08:07.787 --> 08:08.879
Roy?

08:10.890 --> 08:12.824
Call you in an hour, buddy.

08:12.992 --> 08:13.981
Hey!

08:14.460 --> 08:15.518
Remember...

08:17.663 --> 08:19.153
Heart.

08:22.401 --> 08:25.962
There's something not quite right
about this project.

08:26.138 --> 08:28.129
- What? Me, you mean?
- Obviously you.

08:28.307 --> 08:30.639
And McAra. Suicide?

08:31.811 --> 08:34.746
He didn't strike me as the suicidal type.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.643
Always nice to see you, Roy.

08:39.418 --> 08:40.645
Good luck.

08:53.232 --> 08:55.530
Oh, God.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.373
Thank you.

09:53.893 --> 09:55.918
- Yeah?
- <i>Congratulations!</i>

09:55.995 --> 09:58.555
- On what?
<i>- On having me as your agent.</i>

09:58.731 --> 10:00.722
Yeah, I can hardly believe my luck.

10:00.900 --> 10:01.889
<i>Are you packed?</i>

10:01.968 --> 10:03.401
I just got mugged.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.334
<i>Shit! Are you okay?</i>

10:07.406 --> 10:11.240
Yeah, all they took was the manuscript
that Sidney Kroll gave me.

10:11.410 --> 10:12.934
<i>What? Why?</i>

10:13.279 --> 10:15.008
I don't know. You tell me.

10:15.881 --> 10:16.905
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

10:16.983 --> 10:20.077
No, I'm fine. I think they must
have followed me from Rhinehart's.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.950
<i>Why would they do that?</i>

10:23.122 --> 10:26.023
Well, maybe they thought
I had Lang's book.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.456
I knew this whole thing was a bad idea.

10:30.229 --> 10:31.719
<i>You're still okay to fly tonight, right?</i>

10:31.797 --> 10:33.890
For God's sake, Rick, I'm in shock.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.298
<i>Well, here's another shock for you.</i>

10:36.469 --> 10:39.267
<i>For one month's work</i>
<i>on a manuscript that's already written,</i>

10:39.338 --> 10:45.277
<i>Rhinehart Inc. Is willing</i>
<i>to pay you $250,000, plus expenses.</i>

10:46.612 --> 10:48.307
<i>Window seat or aisle?</i>

10:48.714 --> 10:51.945
<i>...Islam has</i>
<i>issued a statement claiming responsibility.</i>

10:52.018 --> 10:54.953
<i>We hope to bring you more on that</i>
<i>later in the bulletin.</i>

10:55.021 --> 10:59.048
<i>Meanwhile, former British Prime Minister</i>
<i>Adam Lang is back in the news tonight.</i>

10:59.158 --> 11:01.991
<i>According to leaked documents,</i>
<i>Mr. Lang authorized</i>

11:02.061 --> 11:04.222
<i>the illegal use of British special forces</i>

11:04.296 --> 11:08.323
<i>to seize four suspected al-Qaeda terrorists</i>
<i>in Pakistan</i>

11:08.401 --> 11:12.167
<i>and then hand them over</i>
<i>for interrogation by the CIA.</i>

11:12.338 --> 11:16.468
<i>The men, Nasir Ashraf, Marwat Sayed,</i>
<i>Salim Khan and Faruk Ahmed,</i>

11:16.542 --> 11:21.479
<i>all British citizens, were seized in the</i>
<i>Pakistani city of Peshawar five years ago.</i>

11:21.881 --> 11:25.009
<i>All four were allegedly transferred</i>
<i>out of the country</i>

11:25.084 --> 11:27.518
<i>to a secret location and tortured.</i>

11:27.586 --> 11:29.918
<i>Mr. Ashraf is reported to have died</i>
<i>under interrogation.</i>

11:31.090 --> 11:33.081
<i>Such an operation</i>
<i>would have been illegal under...</i>

11:33.159 --> 11:34.786
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Where are you?

11:34.860 --> 11:38.227
<i>Heathrow, like you.</i>
<i>Waiting for my flight to New York.</i>

11:38.297 --> 11:39.286
Can you see the news?

11:39.365 --> 11:41.890
<i>The Lang story? Yeah, I'm watching it now.</i>

11:41.967 --> 11:44.231
What have you gotten me into?

11:44.303 --> 11:48.763
<i>I got you into a quarter of a million bucks,</i>
<i>pal, that's what I got you into.</i>

11:49.008 --> 11:50.407
<i>They're calling my flight. I gotta go.</i>

11:50.476 --> 11:51.943
Listen, I just realized

11:52.011 --> 11:54.775
Sidney Kroll could have given me
that manuscript deliberately

11:54.847 --> 11:57.714
so it would look like
I was carrying Lang's book.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.045
<i>Why the hell would he do that?</i>

11:59.118 --> 12:02.849
I don't know. To use me as a tethered goat?

12:04.123 --> 12:06.853
<i>Get some sleep on the plane.</i>
<i>You're sounding weird.</i>

12:06.926 --> 12:10.384
<i>"A tethered goat."</i>
<i>I'll call you next week.</i>

12:10.463 --> 12:12.590
<i>...and long-term psychological trauma.</i>

12:12.665 --> 12:14.132
<i>In other words, torture.</i>

12:14.667 --> 12:15.861
Hello, sir.
Would you like a newspaper to read?

12:15.935 --> 12:18.199
- Have you got the <i>Evening Standard?</i>
- We do, yes.

12:18.270 --> 12:19.897
Thanks. Thank you.

12:20.172 --> 12:21.901
Hello, madam.
Would you like a newspaper to read?

12:21.974 --> 12:24.738
Yes, please. Thank you.

13:52.064 --> 13:53.258
Passport?

14:59.231 --> 15:01.256
This is an absolute scandal!

15:01.333 --> 15:02.322
Amelia Bly. Welcome.

15:03.469 --> 15:04.561
I'm Adam's assistant.

15:04.637 --> 15:08.334
Adam's in New York, unfortunately,
and won't be back until later this afternoon.

15:08.407 --> 15:11.069
Actually, forget I said that,
it's bloody ridiculous!

15:12.244 --> 15:15.475
Oh, dear. I'm so sorry.
I'm afraid Ruth's having one of those days.

15:15.547 --> 15:17.105
If this isn't a good time, I could go to...

15:17.182 --> 15:19.377
No, no. She's keen to meet you.

15:20.185 --> 15:23.052
- Right. Shall we make a start?
- Right.

15:24.890 --> 15:27.222
- How was your journey?
- Long.

15:27.393 --> 15:28.951
- We're a small team.
- Thanks.

15:29.028 --> 15:30.393
This is Alice.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.061
Lucy's traveling with Adam.

15:33.232 --> 15:36.793
We need another pair of hands, but Adam
couldn't bring himself to replace Mike.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.962
- They were together so long.
- How long were you with him?

15:39.038 --> 15:41.438
Eight years.
I'm an attachment from Number 10.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.132
Ah. Poor Number 10.

15:43.208 --> 15:44.641
Before I show you the manuscript,

15:44.710 --> 15:47.702
I need you to sign
this confidentiality agreement.

15:52.251 --> 15:53.513
Sign here.

15:57.356 --> 15:58.618
And here.

16:00.426 --> 16:01.757
And here.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.866
Wow, quite a place.

16:15.407 --> 16:17.034
Don't you get Ionely at night?

16:17.176 --> 16:18.803
It's my husband I miss the most.

16:18.877 --> 16:21.038
Are you married?
I noticed you don't wear a wedding ring.

16:21.113 --> 16:23.138
I can't, sadly. It's far too large.

16:23.215 --> 16:26.378
- It bleeps when I go through airport security.
- Oh.

16:27.586 --> 16:28.985
Here we are.

16:32.224 --> 16:36.388
The manuscript is not to be removed
from this room. It's not to be copied.

16:37.963 --> 16:40.898
You have six hours
before Adam gets in from New York.

16:40.966 --> 16:43.867
- Can you finish by then?
- I'll try.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.902
I'll ask Dep to bring you up
a sandwich for lunch.

16:46.972 --> 16:47.996
Thanks.

16:53.579 --> 16:54.705
Have fun.

17:02.254 --> 17:05.587
"Langs are Scottish folk,
originally, and proud of it.

17:05.656 --> 17:10.094
"Our name is a derivation of 'long,<i>'</i>
the Old English word for 'tall,<i>'</i>

17:10.162 --> 17:13.598
"and it is from north of the border
that my forefathers hail."

17:14.299 --> 17:15.288
Fuck.

17:17.102 --> 17:19.400
"My great-grandfather, Ebenezer Lang,

17:19.471 --> 17:23.237
"was born in 1862 in Pitlochry, Scotland.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.276
"One of nine children, seven of them boys."

17:25.344 --> 17:28.108
"The American President
was much taller than I had expected."

17:29.415 --> 17:32.407
"This year's European summit
was particularly interesting."

17:32.484 --> 17:35.385
"I always found the Queen, in private,
to have a delightful sense of humor."

17:54.406 --> 17:55.600
Thanks.

18:19.431 --> 18:23.492
"I've always been an optimist.
The present is where we live.

18:23.569 --> 18:27.437
"Ruth and I look forward to the future,
whatever it may hold."

18:31.276 --> 18:32.675
As bad as that?

18:34.113 --> 18:35.205
Oh, hello.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.742
Well? How bad is it?

18:38.817 --> 18:40.341
You haven't read it?

18:40.586 --> 18:41.780
Not all of it.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.048
- Well, let's just say it needs some work.
- How much work?

18:45.124 --> 18:48.218
Well, all the words are there.
They're just in the wrong order.

18:49.761 --> 18:52.753
Come on. You look like you need a break.

18:56.568 --> 18:58.058
You were my idea.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.168
I was?

19:00.506 --> 19:02.633
You wrote Christy Costello's memoirs,
didn't you?

19:02.808 --> 19:04.332
You read those?

19:04.510 --> 19:07.843
We stayed at his house in Mustique,
last winter.

19:08.247 --> 19:09.373
The book was beside the bed.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.211
- I'm embarrassed.
- No, why?

19:11.283 --> 19:14.582
It was brilliant, in a horrible sort of way.

19:14.953 --> 19:19.754
How you turned his ramblings
into something vaguely coherent.

19:20.459 --> 19:24.623
I said to Adam, "Here's the guy
to write your book, not Mike."

19:26.798 --> 19:29.733
God, I miss home.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.703
It's like being married
to Napoleon on St. Helena.

19:37.976 --> 19:40.809
- Why don't you go back to London?
- I don't feel I can leave him alone.

19:40.879 --> 19:43.313
There's something not quite right
with him at the moment.

19:44.716 --> 19:47.981
Amelia told me he was very upset
at the death of Michael McAra.

19:48.053 --> 19:49.384
Oh, she did, did she?

19:49.855 --> 19:54.224
Quite when Mrs. Bly became the expert
on my husband's emotions, I'm not sure.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.191
Losing Mike was a blow, of course,

20:01.466 --> 20:02.990
but it's not just that.

20:03.168 --> 20:08.071
It's having to relive everything,
year by year, for this bloody book.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.507
Oh, dear.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.814
You must be wondering
what you've let yourself in for.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.986
Fine, fine. I'll tell him.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.646
They're just about to land.

20:23.822 --> 20:24.846
On Thursday, he's in Chicago.

20:24.923 --> 20:27.084
Actually, I think I'll go and meet him.

20:27.426 --> 20:30.327
Amelia can stay here
and polish her nails or something.

20:30.495 --> 20:32.486
Why don't you come, say hello?

20:32.664 --> 20:36.691
Fine. I'll travel in the backup car.
I can do my nails in there.

21:25.317 --> 21:26.545
Hi, darling.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.552
- How was New York?
- Short and sweet.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.747
Hi, Barry. Hi, Amelia.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.687
Hello. Who are you?

21:33.759 --> 21:34.919
I'm your ghost.

21:35.827 --> 21:36.851
Right.

21:36.928 --> 21:39.294
Don't worry. He isn't always such a jerk.

21:48.907 --> 21:51.034
This place really comes alive at night.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.539
You'll be with us for four weeks,
is that right?

22:23.608 --> 22:24.632
I'm afraid so.

22:24.710 --> 22:27.076
And the bill goes directly
to the Rhinehart Corporation?

22:27.145 --> 22:28.134
Good.

22:28.213 --> 22:30.613
That doesn't include the mini-bar.

23:14.493 --> 23:16.723
All right. He's ready for you.

23:20.832 --> 23:22.322
How's your hotel? Quiet?

23:22.401 --> 23:23.493
Monastic.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.798
That's nice. No distractions.

23:33.945 --> 23:35.412
Thanks, love.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.214
Hi, man. You ready to start?

23:40.285 --> 23:41.616
Absolutely.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.400
- Is the manuscript loaded on this?
- It is.

24:00.472 --> 24:01.461
Can I have it?

24:01.540 --> 24:03.474
I'm sorry,
that would be a security risk.

24:04.376 --> 24:06.207
You mean I've got to retype
the whole manuscript?

24:06.278 --> 24:08.644
Have you really got my entire book
on that little thing?

24:08.713 --> 24:10.374
We can get 100 books on it, Adam.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.646
And it can be copied in a flash.
That's the trouble.

24:13.718 --> 24:14.946
Amazing.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.415
You know the worst thing about my life?
You get so out of touch.

24:18.490 --> 24:21.721
Everything's done for you.
You don't drive, you don't carry money.

24:21.793 --> 24:25.092
If I need cash,
I have to borrow it from the protection boys.

24:25.897 --> 24:28.092
This is the kind of details
we need in the memoirs.

24:28.166 --> 24:31.329
I couldn't put that in.
People would think I was a complete idiot.

24:31.403 --> 24:35.669
No, not at all. No, this shows what it's like
being Prime Minister.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.537
That's exactly
what the readers want to know.

24:37.609 --> 24:41.170
How does it feel to run a country?
How does it feel to be so cut off?

24:41.246 --> 24:43.271
How does it feel to be so hated?

24:43.348 --> 24:44.679
Thanks a lot.

24:44.749 --> 24:46.512
And so loved.

24:46.585 --> 24:48.143
Amelia, what do you think?

24:48.220 --> 24:50.780
I think I should leave you two alone.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.228
So, how do we go about this?

25:03.335 --> 25:04.927
I interview you.

25:05.804 --> 25:07.738
I turn your answers into prose.

25:07.806 --> 25:10.775
Here and there, I'll add linking passages,
imitating your voice.

25:10.842 --> 25:11.934
Okay.

25:13.378 --> 25:16.006
- You heard about Mike?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

25:19.551 --> 25:22.179
We should put in
something nice about him.

25:22.254 --> 25:24.188
I think his mother would like that.

25:24.256 --> 25:25.621
Of course.

25:29.060 --> 25:32.723
Well, um, the first thing that struck me was,

25:32.998 --> 25:34.795
you became such a successful politician

25:34.866 --> 25:37.460
precisely because
you didn't appear to be a politician.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.164
It's certainly not something I wanted to do
when I was younger.

25:40.238 --> 25:42.866
I thought most student politicians
were complete nerds.

25:42.941 --> 25:46.206
Well, I'm with you there.
So, what turned you on to politics?

25:47.712 --> 25:49.509
Turned me on, indeed.

25:51.683 --> 25:56.848
Let's see, I was 23, something like that,
a couple of years out of Cambridge.

25:57.889 --> 26:01.518
And I remember it was a Sunday afternoon,
it was raining.

26:01.593 --> 26:05.290
I was still in bed.
And someone starts knocking at the door.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.227
And, you know,
I'd been out the night before

26:09.301 --> 26:11.826
and had a few drinks and what have you.

26:11.903 --> 26:14.701
So, I get the pillow and I put it
over my head, and it starts up again.

26:14.773 --> 26:16.297
Knock, knock, knock, knock!

26:16.374 --> 26:20.333
And I get up, I'm swearing,
I go to the door and there's this girl.

26:20.412 --> 26:24.314
She's soaking wet, but she just launches
into this speech about the local elections.

26:24.382 --> 26:25.906
And that's it.

26:27.652 --> 26:29.916
- I'm in love.
- And this is Ruth?

26:30.689 --> 26:32.316
This is Ruth.

26:33.525 --> 26:36.961
And the only way I can see her again
is to join the party and hand out leaflets.

26:37.028 --> 26:38.495
This is great.

26:39.464 --> 26:40.556
You want to use this?

26:40.632 --> 26:43.362
Use it? I think we should open
the whole book like this.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.300
"I went into politics out of love,

26:45.370 --> 26:49.534
"not love for a party or an ideology,
but out of love for a woman."

26:51.376 --> 26:53.367
Could you transcribe this
as quickly as possible, please?

26:53.445 --> 26:54.776
Of course.

26:55.313 --> 26:56.644
- Thanks.
- How's it going?

26:56.715 --> 26:58.615
Pretty well. He keeps calling me "man."

26:58.683 --> 27:01.709
He always does that
when he can't remember someone's name.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.084
There are sandwiches in the kitchen.

29:03.641 --> 29:05.199
Oh, shit.

29:06.711 --> 29:08.008
It's awful.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.047
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't realize there was anyone up there.

29:10.115 --> 29:11.605
What on earth is going on?

29:11.683 --> 29:14.277
It's just a security drill, sir.
We have it once a week.

29:14.352 --> 29:17.048
So, there you are.
I'd rather lost track of you.

29:17.122 --> 29:19.249
I'm a big boy now.
Can't keep your eye on me all the time.

29:19.324 --> 29:21.815
Don't wander around on your own.
The security boys don't like it.

29:21.893 --> 29:23.053
Gotcha.

29:26.097 --> 29:29.430
- Did you win?
- Didn't play tennis. Gym.

29:31.870 --> 29:34.805
Gym? What's he in training for?
The Olympics?

29:36.407 --> 29:38.307
Here's your transcript.

29:45.884 --> 29:47.715
Cambridge. Let's talk about that.

29:49.254 --> 29:50.380
Sorry? Um...

29:51.089 --> 29:52.454
Cambridge?

29:53.958 --> 29:57.052
It was such a long time ago,
I can hardly remember.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.686
You did a lot of acting?

29:59.364 --> 30:00.456
Some.

30:01.366 --> 30:04.130
It must have been good training
for politics, acting?

30:04.702 --> 30:06.567
It was a good way to meet girls.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.129
Let's not put that in, by the way, okay?

30:09.207 --> 30:11.903
Still, acting must have been
very important to you.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.341
Okay, let's say I enjoyed it.

30:13.411 --> 30:15.402
You know, you go on the stage,
pretend to be somebody else,

30:15.480 --> 30:18.142
and people actually applaud you for it.

30:18.216 --> 30:19.683
Good, that's more like it. Let's put that in.

30:19.751 --> 30:20.775
- No.
- Why not?

30:20.852 --> 30:22.717
Because these are the memoirs
of a Prime Minister.

30:22.787 --> 30:25.017
And whenever my opponents were stuck
with something to hit me with,

30:25.089 --> 30:27.148
they always said I was a bloody actor!

30:27.225 --> 30:30.558
Do you know what the <i>Times of London</i>
said the day I resigned?

30:30.628 --> 30:32.562
"Kindly leave the stage."

30:32.630 --> 30:36.225
So, no, we won't dwell, if you don't mind,
on my student days as an actor.

30:36.301 --> 30:39.134
We leave it exactly the way Mike wrote it.

30:41.039 --> 30:42.233
Would you like to take
a break for a minute?

30:42.307 --> 30:45.640
Actually, that would be a good idea,
thank you. I need to make a call.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.115
What a bastard.

31:04.395 --> 31:05.862
Look at this.

31:10.668 --> 31:13.193
"Former British Foreign Secretary
Richard Rycart

31:13.271 --> 31:16.331
"has asked the International Criminal Court
in The Hague to investigate allegations

31:16.407 --> 31:18.432
"that the former British Prime Minister
Adam Lang

31:18.509 --> 31:21.103
"ordered the illegal handover
of terrorist suspects

31:21.713 --> 31:23.271
"for torture by the CIA."

31:24.549 --> 31:25.709
Don't!

31:28.920 --> 31:30.478
The pack is on the move.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.386
Unplug all the phones.

31:32.924 --> 31:35.916
Is Ruth still out walking?
Shit! She is, isn't she?

31:35.994 --> 31:38.360
- Barry! Barry!
- Yeah.

31:38.429 --> 31:41.921
Would you please find Mrs. Lang
and get her back here as soon as you can?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.627
- Right.
- Let's go.

31:44.769 --> 31:46.430
- Rycart has made a statement.
- Yes, I know.

31:46.504 --> 31:47.835
- He just called me.
- It's unbelievable.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.170
He wanted very much to let me know
it was nothing personal.

31:50.241 --> 31:52.266
He wanted very, very much to tell me
that it was only

31:52.343 --> 31:56.245
because of his well-known stand
on human rights

31:56.314 --> 31:58.612
that he couldn't keep quiet any longer.

31:58.683 --> 32:02.210
"His well-known stand on human rights."
Dear God!

32:08.559 --> 32:11.289
- Sorry to lose my temper earlier.
- Forget it.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.764
And have you told her?

32:15.266 --> 32:17.734
- Yes. Just called her.
- And how did she take it?

32:17.802 --> 32:20.066
Sorry, Adam. This is running on AP.

32:22.106 --> 32:23.869
"According to sources in The Hague,

32:23.942 --> 32:27.105
"the prosecutor's office
of the International Criminal Court

32:27.178 --> 32:29.078
"will issue a statement in the morning."

32:29.147 --> 32:30.444
Oh, Adam.

32:31.549 --> 32:32.914
Thank you, Alice.

32:32.984 --> 32:36.147
Why weren't we given some warning
of this? Where's Downing Street?

32:36.220 --> 32:37.346
The phones are disconnected.

32:37.422 --> 32:38.946
Switch is probably
trying to get through now.

32:39.023 --> 32:43.255
Now? What freaking use is now?
What are you people doing?

32:43.328 --> 32:44.488
I mean, you're not telling me that

32:44.562 --> 32:46.223
the Cabinet Office
didn't know this was coming?

32:46.297 --> 32:49.460
The war crimes court doesn't warn
a suspect who's under investigation.

32:49.534 --> 32:51.934
That's what Adam is now, a suspect?

32:52.003 --> 32:53.265
You need to call Sid Kroll.

32:53.338 --> 32:55.363
I think we should call London first.

32:55.440 --> 32:58.932
Adam! If it suits them,
they will hang you out to dry.

32:59.010 --> 33:01.137
You need a lawyer. Call Sid.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.413
- Get Sid on the line.
- What about the media?

33:05.483 --> 33:07.951
Issue a holding statement, something short.

33:08.019 --> 33:09.816
This is when we need Mike.

33:09.887 --> 33:11.650
I'll write something.

33:11.723 --> 33:14.089
Let him do it.
He's supposed to be the writer.

33:14.158 --> 33:16.456
- Hang on a minute.
- I should sound confident.

33:16.527 --> 33:19.963
Not defensive, that'd be fatal.
But I shouldn't be cocky.

33:20.031 --> 33:21.726
No bitterness, no anger, and don't say

33:21.799 --> 33:25.235
I'm pleased at this opportunity
to clear my name or any balls like that.

33:25.303 --> 33:27.635
So, you're not defensive,
but you're not cocky.

33:27.705 --> 33:29.297
You're not angry, but you're not pleased?

33:29.374 --> 33:31.968
- That's it.
- Then what exactly are you?

33:35.113 --> 33:36.341
Told you he was funny.

33:36.414 --> 33:39.247
I've always been a passionate supporter...

33:39.317 --> 33:40.807
No, scrub that.

33:41.419 --> 33:44.650
I've always been
a strong, no, committed supporter

33:44.722 --> 33:48.158
of the work
of the International Criminal Court. Has he?

33:48.559 --> 33:49.856
You're the writer.

33:49.927 --> 33:52.521
The struggle against terror is too important

33:52.597 --> 33:55.725
to be used for the purposes
of personal revenge.

33:56.434 --> 33:59.733
Very good.
You could be the new Mike McAra.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.439
- Hello?
- <i>John Maddox.</i>

34:03.508 --> 34:07.274
<i>This is gonna be big.</i>
<i>This can only be good for us.</i>

34:07.345 --> 34:10.041
- Could be.
<i>- Here's the first chapter right here.</i>

34:10.114 --> 34:11.342
Okay.

34:11.416 --> 34:13.509
<i>What've you covered so far?</i>

34:13.684 --> 34:14.810
Um...

34:15.453 --> 34:17.784
The early years, childhood, university.

34:17.855 --> 34:20.688
<i>All right, forget that crap.</i>
<i>Get him focused on the war crimes.</i>

34:20.757 --> 34:23.522
<i>And he can't talk to anybody else, all right?</i>

34:23.594 --> 34:25.425
- Right.
<i>- It's gotta be our exclusive.</i>

34:25.496 --> 34:27.157
<i>Any chance of you</i>
<i>finishing the manuscript sooner?</i>

34:27.231 --> 34:28.219
Sooner?

34:28.299 --> 34:30.027
<i>Yeah, yeah, sooner.</i>

34:30.701 --> 34:32.134
Well, how much sooner?

34:32.203 --> 34:34.068
<i>I'm thinking two weeks.</i>

34:35.440 --> 34:36.634
Jesus.

34:37.408 --> 34:40.002
<i>Look, I know it's tough,</i>
<i>but if anyone can do it, you can.</i>

34:40.078 --> 34:42.409
<i>I'm relying on you. We'll talk.</i>

34:49.853 --> 34:50.911
Shit.

34:56.293 --> 34:57.591
I'd never have guessed you smoked.

34:57.662 --> 35:01.359
I only allow myself one
at times of great stress or contentment.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.866
- And which is this?
- Very funny.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.267
Maddox just called. He wants the book
in two weeks instead of four.

35:06.337 --> 35:07.565
Christ. Good luck.

35:07.638 --> 35:11.165
Yeah, I wouldn't mind a lift back to my
hotel. I could get on with some work there.

35:11.242 --> 35:12.709
You're not planning on
taking that manuscript

35:12.777 --> 35:14.642
- out of here, are you?
- Course not.

35:14.712 --> 35:17.579
Because you do realize
how serious this is getting, don't you?

35:17.648 --> 35:20.617
- You can search me, if you like.
- That won't be necessary.

35:22.286 --> 35:25.881
All right. Fetch your stuff.
I'll get one of the boys to take you.

35:26.591 --> 35:29.560
<i>Mr. Lang insisted he had always been</i>
<i>a committed supporter</i>

35:29.627 --> 35:32.596
<i>of the work</i>
<i>of the International Criminal Court.</i>

35:32.663 --> 35:34.255
<i>Mr. Lang added, quote,</i>

35:34.332 --> 35:36.664
<i>"The struggle against terror</i>
<i>is too important</i>

35:36.734 --> 35:39.328
<i>"to be used for the purposes</i>
<i>of personal revenge."</i>

35:39.403 --> 35:41.371
- Same again, sir?
<i>- This is being widely interpreted as...</i>

35:41.439 --> 35:42.872
- Yes, thanks.
<i>...an attack on the former British</i>

35:42.940 --> 35:46.432
<i>Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart,</i>
<i>who has asked...</i>

35:46.511 --> 35:47.671
Could we change the channel?

35:47.745 --> 35:49.736
- Sure.
- Thanks.

35:49.814 --> 35:53.272
<i>At issue is the practice</i>
<i>of so-called waterboarding,</i>

35:53.351 --> 35:55.478
<i>an interrogation technique</i>
<i>considered a war...</i>

35:57.722 --> 36:00.589
- Something to eat?
- What've you got?

36:00.658 --> 36:04.219
- Club sandwich. Clam chowder.
- Chowder will be fine.

36:06.797 --> 36:08.287
You're English?

36:11.502 --> 36:12.992
And so are you.

36:13.538 --> 36:14.937
Indeed I am.

36:15.606 --> 36:18.404
- You here on a holiday?
- No, I'm working.

36:18.476 --> 36:20.239
So, what's your line?

36:20.511 --> 36:22.706
Just this and that. Excuse me.

36:25.316 --> 36:27.750
I hear Adam Lang's on the island.

36:31.155 --> 36:32.452
Is he?

36:32.523 --> 36:33.854
So I hear.

36:35.660 --> 36:37.525
You don't happen to know
his whereabouts, do you?

36:37.595 --> 36:38.619
No.

36:39.830 --> 36:42.230
No, I'm afraid not. If you don't mind.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.461
<i>Raymond to Naslund and to Mattias Ohlund.</i>

36:45.536 --> 36:49.131
<i>A slap pass to Lukas Krajicek.</i>
<i>He's in trouble against</i>

36:50.174 --> 36:52.574
<i>Barret Jackman and the referee...</i>

36:53.511 --> 36:54.739
Asshole.

36:54.845 --> 36:58.337
<i>...and Ohlund can't hold it in again,</i>
<i>and this power play is just about over.</i>

36:58.416 --> 37:00.884
<i>Keith Tkachuk almost set to come back on.</i>

37:37.421 --> 37:38.615
Hello?

37:48.933 --> 37:50.594
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

37:50.668 --> 37:54.570
Yeah, can you tell me,
has anyone gone up to my room?

37:54.639 --> 37:55.697
No, sir.

37:55.773 --> 37:57.866
- Did anyone ask for me?
- No.

38:00.645 --> 38:03.170
What about that other guest? The, um...

38:03.948 --> 38:06.007
There's an Englishman.

38:06.083 --> 38:08.779
You're the only guest in the hotel, sir.

38:23.434 --> 38:24.492
- Hello?
- <i>You need to check out</i>

38:24.568 --> 38:26.331
<i>of the hotel immediately.</i>

38:26.404 --> 38:28.599
<i>Things have changed. A car is on its way.</i>

38:28.673 --> 38:29.799
What?

38:30.041 --> 38:31.474
<i>See you then.</i>

38:32.443 --> 38:33.637
Hello?

39:02.807 --> 39:04.672
- Okay.
- Just check on that. Okay?

39:12.216 --> 39:14.980
- It's getting big, huh?
- So I see.

39:15.986 --> 39:17.578
Who're you with?

39:18.789 --> 39:20.313
I'm on my own.

39:23.561 --> 39:25.791
Oh, sod it. Here we go again.

39:32.870 --> 39:35.771
<i>You've reached the office</i>
<i>of Rick Ricardelli. Leave a message.</i>

39:35.840 --> 39:38.570
Hi, Rick.
Now they want the book in two weeks.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.078
Thanks for getting me this job.

39:41.145 --> 39:43.909
Can't talk.
Some peace protestors are trying to kill me.

39:43.981 --> 39:47.781
You're working for a murderer!
You're working for a murderer!

39:49.453 --> 39:51.887
Liar! Liar! Liar!

39:57.528 --> 39:59.587
- Are you ill?
- No, I'm aging.

40:00.364 --> 40:02.889
This place is Shangri-La in reverse.

40:03.334 --> 40:05.461
I tried to call you
several times last night.

40:05.536 --> 40:06.662
You didn't answer.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.466
I forgot to charge my mobile phone.

40:08.539 --> 40:10.734
Really? And the hotel phone?

40:10.808 --> 40:11.968
I'm a heavy sleeper.

40:12.042 --> 40:14.567
Well, you can do your heavy sleeping here
from now on.

40:14.645 --> 40:16.806
- Here?
- We're under siege.

40:16.881 --> 40:19.372
You can't run the media gauntlet every day.

40:19.450 --> 40:23.910
Eventually, they'll discover who you are.
And that would be horrid for you.

40:32.563 --> 40:34.360
So, this is where you put the granny.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.456
No.

40:36.133 --> 40:38.465
This is where we put Mike McAra.

40:44.742 --> 40:48.473
We haven't had a chance to clear it yet.
The sheets have been changed, though.

40:48.546 --> 40:51.174
Actually, I make it a rule
never to stay in a client's house.

40:51.248 --> 40:54.308
But now you can have constant access
to the manuscript.

40:54.385 --> 40:55.443
Isn't that what you want?

40:55.519 --> 40:57.817
Besides, Sid Kroll
will be arriving any minute.

40:57.888 --> 41:01.289
Why don't you settle in,
and then come up and join us?

41:01.358 --> 41:03.986
- You're practically one of us now.
- I am?

41:04.061 --> 41:08.122
You drafted the statement yesterday.
That makes you an accomplice.

41:12.036 --> 41:14.561
So, here's the score. You're not being
charged, you're not being arrested.

41:14.638 --> 41:16.003
None of this is gonna amount
to a hill of beans.

41:16.073 --> 41:17.870
The only thing the prosecutor is asking for

41:17.942 --> 41:19.967
is permission to launch
a formal investigation.

41:20.044 --> 41:22.274
- Investigating me for what?
- Connie?

41:22.346 --> 41:24.246
Either crimes against humanity
or war crimes.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.011
Well, that's absurd.
It's not exactly genocide.

41:27.084 --> 41:29.985
"Under Article 25,
a person shall be guilty of a war crime

41:30.054 --> 41:32.716
"if that person facilitates the commission
of such a crime

41:32.790 --> 41:35.452
"or aids, abets or otherwise assists
in its commission."

41:35.526 --> 41:38.222
- That's rather sweeping.
- Well, if it's any comfort,

41:38.295 --> 41:41.753
you're in no jeopardy
as long as you stay here, among friends.

41:41.832 --> 41:44.130
Are you saying
I can't leave the United States?

41:44.201 --> 41:47.830
As your attorney, I strongly advise you
not to travel to any country

41:47.905 --> 41:50.965
that recognizes the jurisdiction
of the International Criminal Court.

41:51.041 --> 41:53.509
Well, just about every country in the world
recognizes the ICC.

41:53.577 --> 41:54.737
America doesn't.

41:54.812 --> 41:56.439
- Who else?
- Josh?

41:56.514 --> 41:59.449
Iraq, China, North Korea, Indonesia, Israel.

42:01.452 --> 42:03.977
- And that's it?
- There are some parts of Africa.

42:04.054 --> 42:05.146
Wait!

42:05.222 --> 42:08.714
<i>I wish to make a short statement.</i>
<i>I won't be taking questions.</i>

42:08.792 --> 42:11.226
<i>This morning, I was granted power</i>
<i>to investigate</i>

42:11.295 --> 42:14.856
<i>the former British Prime Minister,</i>
<i>Mr. Adam Peter Bennett Lang,</i>

42:14.932 --> 42:20.632
<i>under Articles 7 and 8 of the 1998 Rome</i>
<i>Statute of the International Criminal Court.</i>

42:21.005 --> 42:24.099
<i>I shall shortly be contacting Mr. Lang</i>
<i>and the British government</i>

42:24.174 --> 42:26.108
<i>to ask for their full cooperation. Thank you.</i>

42:34.652 --> 42:35.676
Oh, God.

42:35.753 --> 42:38.153
Okay, we need to get you to Washington,
Adam, right away.

42:38.222 --> 42:39.450
My plane is at the airport.

42:39.523 --> 42:41.787
We can get you in to see
the Speaker of the House at lunchtime

42:41.859 --> 42:44.293
and have a photo-op
with the Secretary of State in the afternoon.

42:44.361 --> 42:46.226
Won't it look as if I'm panicking?

42:46.297 --> 42:48.424
No, they'll both say
that the meetings were fixed weeks ago.

42:48.499 --> 42:49.932
Well, what the hell
are we supposed to be discussing?

42:50.000 --> 42:52.230
AIDS? Poverty? Climate change?

42:52.303 --> 42:55.329
Who cares? The important thing
is to show the world it's business as usual.

42:55.406 --> 42:58.534
- What do you think, Ruth?
- I think it's a terrible idea.

42:58.609 --> 43:00.201
You'll look as though
you're America's whipping boy,

43:00.277 --> 43:01.835
running crying home to daddy.

43:01.912 --> 43:04.574
- So, what would you do?
- Fly to London.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.982
The government will support you.

43:07.051 --> 43:11.317
"The British government
will cooperate fully with the investigation."

43:11.722 --> 43:14.054
Really? And what makes you think that?

43:14.358 --> 43:17.020
I'm not thinking it, Ruth, I'm reading it.

43:17.561 --> 43:20.553
<i>...believe we can now go live</i>
<i>to the UN in New York,</i>

43:20.631 --> 43:24.294
<i>where the former British Foreign Secretary,</i>
<i>Richard Rycart,</i>

43:24.368 --> 43:26.063
<i>is about to make a statement.</i>

43:26.136 --> 43:29.469
<i>I watched the announcement in The Hague</i>
<i>today with great shock and sadness.</i>

43:29.540 --> 43:31.940
<i>Adam Lang was</i>
<i>and is an old friend of mine.</i>

43:32.009 --> 43:33.567
You cheeky bugger!

43:33.644 --> 43:36.977
<i>I regret that he's chosen to bring this down</i>
<i>to a personal level.</i>

43:37.047 --> 43:39.709
<i>This isn't personal. This is about justice.</i>

43:40.150 --> 43:43.017
<i>This is about making sure</i>
<i>every political leader knows</i>

43:43.087 --> 43:44.611
<i>when they make a decision,</i>

43:44.688 --> 43:47.521
<i>they will be held to account</i>
<i>by international law.</i>

43:48.092 --> 43:49.081
<i>Thank you.</i>

43:49.159 --> 43:50.990
<i>If you're called to testify, sir, will you go?</i>

43:51.061 --> 43:54.497
- <i>Certainly, I'll go.</i>
- Of course you will, you little shit!

43:54.565 --> 43:56.795
That settles it. Washington it is.

43:57.201 --> 43:58.532
I still say it'll look bad.

43:58.602 --> 44:01.469
Not as bad as being led away
from Heathrow in handcuffs.

44:01.538 --> 44:02.766
It would show you had some guts.

44:02.840 --> 44:04.774
Well, then why the hell
don't you just fly back without me?

44:04.842 --> 44:08.642
If the British government wants to hand me
over to this kangaroo court, then sod them!

44:08.712 --> 44:10.942
I'll go where people want me.

44:12.016 --> 44:15.213
Amelia, tell the boys we're leaving.
Have one of the girls pack me a bag.

44:15.285 --> 44:17.185
You'd better pack one for yourself.

44:17.254 --> 44:20.815
Why don't you share a suitcase?
It's so much more convenient.

44:46.383 --> 44:49.682
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm sorry to abandon you.

44:50.254 --> 44:52.085
At least this might help sales.

44:52.222 --> 44:54.713
Perhaps Rhinehart's PR department
organized the whole thing.

44:56.560 --> 44:59.188
Well, tell them to stop it, will you?

45:04.568 --> 45:08.368
Okay, people,
remember, happy, happy faces.

45:15.779 --> 45:19.306
<i>So, just to summarize</i>
<i>what we know so far, it's now official,</i>

45:19.583 --> 45:22.211
<i>the special prosecutor</i>
<i>of the International War Crimes Court</i>

45:22.286 --> 45:23.878
<i>is to launch an investigation...</i>

45:27.458 --> 45:30.859
<i>...the special prosecutor announced</i>
<i>she was going to investigate Mr. Lang,</i>

45:30.928 --> 45:33.453
<i>well, there was a big cheer, I can tell you.</i>

45:33.530 --> 45:35.794
<i>So, let's talk to some of these protestors.</i>

45:35.866 --> 45:38.061
<i>- You, sir, you're English, I believe.</i>
<i>- I am.</i>

45:38.135 --> 45:39.602
<i>So, what brings you so far from home?</i>

45:39.670 --> 45:43.197
<i>My son. He was killed</i>
<i>in one of Mr. Lang's illegal wars.</i>

45:43.574 --> 45:46.907
<i>Lang's never visited the injured.</i>
<i>He's never apologized.</i>

45:46.977 --> 45:50.140
<i>I was in the British Army for 30 years.</i>
<i>It's a disgrace!</i>

45:50.380 --> 45:51.711
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Can I ask you the same question?</i>

45:52.850 --> 45:54.875
<i>You're a murderer, Lang!</i>
<i>You're a war criminal!</i>

45:55.385 --> 45:57.285
Liar, liar, liar!

45:57.354 --> 45:59.254
<i>Lang, Lang, Lang!</i>

45:59.323 --> 46:01.086
Killer, killer, killer!

46:01.158 --> 46:04.821
- <i>Lang, Lang, Lang!</i>
- Liar, liar, liar!

46:05.162 --> 46:10.327
- <i>Lang, Lang, Lang!</i>
- Killer, killer, killer!

46:12.836 --> 46:13.962
Over here, Mr. Lang!

46:14.037 --> 46:17.097
I apologize for keeping you waiting so long
in the cold.

46:17.174 --> 46:19.506
What's your reaction
to Mr. Rycart's statement?

46:19.576 --> 46:23.842
<i>I'd like to say a few words</i>
<i>in response to the news from The Hague.</i>

46:24.948 --> 46:29.851
<i>These are strange times when</i>
<i>those who stand for freedom and justice</i>

46:29.920 --> 46:32.115
<i>are accused of being criminals,</i>

46:32.189 --> 46:36.387
<i>while those who incite hatred</i>
<i>and seek to destroy democracy</i>

46:36.460 --> 46:39.520
<i>- are treated as victims.</i>
- <i>War criminal!</i>

46:40.097 --> 46:43.225
<i>Let me make one thing perfectly clear.</i>

46:43.801 --> 46:47.931
<i>While I have breath in my body,</i>
<i>I shall fight terrorism...</i>

46:48.005 --> 46:48.994
<i>Liar!</i>

46:49.106 --> 46:53.634
<i>...whether it's on the battlefield</i>
<i>or, if necessary, in the courts.</i>

46:54.745 --> 46:55.837
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

46:55.913 --> 46:58.404
<i>Have you spoken</i>
<i>to the President, Mr. Lang?</i>

48:25.035 --> 48:26.696
Oh, for God's sake.

48:33.877 --> 48:35.071
God.

49:34.371 --> 49:35.497
Shit!

49:38.408 --> 49:39.773
One minute!

49:44.014 --> 49:45.106
Yes?

49:48.585 --> 49:50.951
Sir? You want lunch?

49:51.021 --> 49:54.218
That would be great.
Give me five minutes, thanks.

50:17.080 --> 50:18.411
P. Emmett?

50:53.617 --> 50:55.141
<i>Richard Rycart.</i>

50:57.254 --> 50:58.721
<i>Who is this?</i>

51:38.195 --> 51:39.822
- Dep?
- Sir?

51:40.163 --> 51:42.131
Is there a map of the island
that I could borrow?

51:57.848 --> 51:59.816
Look. It's rain soon.

51:59.883 --> 52:02.249
I don't know. I think it will be all right.

52:02.319 --> 52:07.416
Why don't you take the car?
It's for guests. Here's the key.

52:08.391 --> 52:11.417
- For our guests, it's very nice car.
- Oh. Yes.

52:11.495 --> 52:14.396
Mr. McAra loved this car very, very much.

52:14.931 --> 52:18.423
Do you know... I'm gonna take the...
I'm gonna take the bicycle. Thanks.

52:18.502 --> 52:20.163
This is... Just a moment, just a moment.

52:20.237 --> 52:25.038
It's rain. I give...
I give you my hat and my gloves.

52:25.342 --> 52:27.469
- That's very kind, thank you.
- Good luck for you.

52:27.544 --> 52:30.411
- Thank you. Thank you, yeah, bye.
- Bye-bye.

53:01.611 --> 53:02.805
Just one moment.

54:26.029 --> 54:27.963
God, you frightened me.

54:28.231 --> 54:30.825
- You're British.
- I am, yeah.

54:31.735 --> 54:34.169
It's okay, you can shelter. Sheltering's free.

54:35.472 --> 54:37.406
No, no, no, no! Rosie, Rosie!

54:37.474 --> 54:39.408
In you go. In, in.

54:40.210 --> 54:41.336
Here.

54:44.714 --> 54:47.114
- So, you're British, huh?
- Yeah.

54:47.517 --> 54:51.476
- You anything to do with this fellow, Lang?
- In a way, yes.

54:51.554 --> 54:53.215
Seems intelligent.

54:53.290 --> 54:55.622
Now why did he go
and get himself mixed up

54:55.692 --> 54:57.284
with that damn fool in the White House?

54:57.360 --> 54:59.123
Well, that's what everyone wants to know.

54:59.195 --> 55:02.187
What brings you to this part of the island?

55:02.532 --> 55:04.557
I'm sightseeing.

55:05.602 --> 55:08.469
Well, you sure picked a heck of a day for it.

55:08.538 --> 55:12.975
Someone I knew was found washed up
on the beach there.

55:13.043 --> 55:16.570
- You mean the British guy from the ferry?
- That's right.

55:17.213 --> 55:20.444
- Now that was a funny business.
- What do you mean?

55:21.051 --> 55:24.543
No way should that current have carried him
that far west.

55:24.621 --> 55:26.350
- No?
- No way!

55:26.423 --> 55:27.913
Are you sure?

55:28.658 --> 55:30.853
I've lived here 54 years.

55:31.361 --> 55:33.192
Did you mention that to the police?

55:33.263 --> 55:37.859
The police? At my age,
I've better things to do, young man.

55:38.601 --> 55:40.933
Annabeth's the one dealing with the police.

55:41.004 --> 55:42.164
Your wife?

55:42.238 --> 55:46.299
Annabeth Wurmbrand,
Mars Wurmbrand's widow.

55:47.043 --> 55:50.206
She's the one
who told them about the lights.

55:50.680 --> 55:54.013
- Lights?
- The flashlights on the beach.

55:54.084 --> 55:58.020
- When?
- The night the body was washed up.

56:00.557 --> 56:02.388
Could, could you, um...

56:03.293 --> 56:06.126
Could you point me in the direction
of Mrs. Wurmbrand's house?

56:06.429 --> 56:08.226
Oh, sure. You just...

56:08.798 --> 56:11.289
Here. Follow it down the beach there.

56:11.368 --> 56:14.565
It's the house nearest the ocean.
But she won't talk to you.

56:14.637 --> 56:17.401
- Why not?
- She's in a coma.

56:18.241 --> 56:20.732
Fell down stairs a week ago.

56:21.144 --> 56:23.772
Been in a coma ever since.

57:05.388 --> 57:06.855
Come down!

57:16.232 --> 57:17.631
Come down!

57:21.438 --> 57:23.929
Dep told me you were here!

57:24.374 --> 57:25.602
What?

57:25.675 --> 57:29.372
I said Dep told me you were here.

57:29.446 --> 57:32.472
We came to get you before the storm came.
What are you doing?

57:32.549 --> 57:34.449
- Just taking the air.
- No, really.

57:34.517 --> 57:36.985
I wanted to see
where Mike McAra was found.

57:37.053 --> 57:38.145
Why?

57:38.221 --> 57:41.816
Adam's asked me
to write something about him in the book.

57:42.392 --> 57:44.485
- Where's your bike?
- Up there.

57:44.561 --> 57:47.155
Barry, will you come around with the car?
We'll meet you out by the road.

57:47.230 --> 57:49.926
I can't do that, I'm afraid, Mrs. Lang.
Have to stay with you at all times.

57:49.999 --> 57:51.899
For God's sake!

57:51.968 --> 57:53.833
If we meet any terrorists, I'll text you.

57:53.903 --> 57:56.337
All right, well, stay on the path.
Don't speak to anyone.

57:56.406 --> 57:59.375
We won't talk to a soul, Officer, I promise.

58:02.879 --> 58:07.407
Poor Mike. I can't bear the idea of him
ending up so far from home.

58:08.284 --> 58:11.720
I wonder if we'll ever know
whether it was accident or suicide.

58:11.788 --> 58:14.154
Can't help you. I never met him.

58:15.592 --> 58:17.753
I suppose it doesn't really matter.

58:17.827 --> 58:21.854
He was drunk. He drowned. End of story.

58:23.199 --> 58:26.635
- What was he doing on the ferry?
- No idea.

58:28.905 --> 58:31.567
Funeral's on Monday, in London.

58:33.810 --> 58:35.869
I'm thinking of going.

58:35.945 --> 58:37.139
One of us should put in an appearance,

58:37.213 --> 58:39.579
and it doesn't seem likely
to be my husband.

58:39.649 --> 58:40.911
I thought you didn't want to leave him.

58:40.984 --> 58:44.476
Rather seems as though he's left me,
wouldn't you say?

59:56.626 --> 01:00:00.118
- Hello?
- Sorry. I did knock. It's just me.

01:00:00.697 --> 01:00:04.064
- I brought you some dry clothes.
- That's all right. I can manage.

01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:06.260
Dinner's in an hour, okay?

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:11.205
Fine, thanks. For God's sake.

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:32.993
<i>"It was at the time</i>

01:00:33.062 --> 01:00:35.292

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:49.538
Mmm.

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:53.348
- Perfect fit. Now all you need is a drink.
- What are we having?

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:57.785
Biodynamic white wine from
the Rhinehart Vinery in the Napa Valley.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:04.923
Rhinehart. He doesn't
own a distillery, I suppose?

01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:10.659
Mmm. Evening news.

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:13.995
<i>...for war crimes.</i>
<i>Our political editor has more.</i>

Pour us some more wine, will you?

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:21.677
I may have to get drunk for a change.

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:25.973

<i>Thank you very much, indeed.</i>
<i>It's good to see you.</i>

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:45.198
Don't grin.

01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:48.731
For God's sake!

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:03.010
Adam.

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:07.685
Calling to find out how I think it went.

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:11.420
- Let him sweat.
- Does he always ask for your advice?

01:02:11.494 --> 01:02:12.961
Yes,

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:16.160
and always usually takes it.

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:18.723
Until lately.

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:23.234
- Are you married?
- Certainly not.

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:25.331
- Gay?
- No.

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:28.939
- Did you have a...
- I had a... Um...

01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:32.139
- What? Girlfriend?
- Well, a bit more than that.

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:33.546
Partner?

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:35.715
A bit less than that.

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:37.616
I don't know,
40,000 years of human language

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:39.848
and there's no word
to describe our relationship.

01:02:39.922 --> 01:02:41.116
It was doomed.

01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:45.951
Come on. Let's eat.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.064
- How's it going?
- The book?

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:57.496
- Well, it's not, to be honest.
- Sit there.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.502
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:05.104
I find it difficult
to understand certain things.

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:07.672
- What things?
- Well...

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:12.383
I can't understand
why this good-Iooking lad

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:16.448
who goes to Cambridge
without the slightest interest in politics

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:20.294
and who spends his time acting
and chasing girls,

01:03:21.063 --> 01:03:22.860
- suddenly ends up...
- Married to me?

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:25.833
Oh, no, not that. No, not that, at all.

01:03:27.403 --> 01:03:29.598
No, what I don't get

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:33.039
is why, at 22,
he's suddenly a political activist.

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:35.839
- I mean, where does that come from?
- Didn't you ask him?

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:38.574
He said he joined the party because of you.

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:41.446
Told me a great story about you
turning up at his place in the rain.

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:44.350
- I was gonna start the whole book with it.
- And now you're not?

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:47.446
No, I can't. It's not true.

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:51.318
- Isn't it?
- Well, you know it's not.

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:53.819
He'd been a member for two years
before he met you.

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:55.727
How do you know that?

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:59.523
I've got a copy
of his original party membership card.

01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:03.597
Mike McAra found it in the archives.

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:07.439
Typical Mike, to ruin a good story
with too much research.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.501
Did he find anything else?

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:12.013
Not much. Cambridge stuff mainly.

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:17.475
You were more political than he was.

01:04:17.553 --> 01:04:21.011
I was certainly a change
from his Cambridge girlfriends.

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:23.718
All those Jocastas and Pandoras.

01:04:23.793 --> 01:04:26.728
And so his marriage to you
must have been pretty vital,

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:29.356
your knowledge
and your contacts in the party.

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:32.230
And I thought he married me for my body.

01:04:35.638 --> 01:04:39.074
Did you ever want to be
a proper politician in your own right?

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:42.338
Of course.
Didn't you want to be a proper writer?

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:44.835
Ouch.

01:04:46.816 --> 01:04:50.252
I'm sorry. I've hurt your feelings.

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:54.320
I suppose even ghosts must have feelings.

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:56.917
We are sensitive spirits.

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:01.791
Talking of spirits, could you...

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:04.132
Let me get you a proper drink.

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:16.268
White wine,
never really seen the point of it.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:19.177
That's the sort of thing Mike used to say.

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:21.842
Ah! At last, something in common.

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:27.956
Do you know the coroner reckoned
he'd drunk nearly half a bottle?

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:29.685
That's convenient.

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:32.961
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.763
- You think his death was suspicious?
- Don't you?

01:05:40.836 --> 01:05:41.962
Yes.

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:45.471
Yes, I do.

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:51.807
Today at the beach,

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:55.740
I met a man, an old timer
who was familiar with the currents.

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:57.581
And he said that there was no way

01:05:57.653 --> 01:06:00.986
that a body from the ferry
could have washed ashore on that spot.

01:06:01.057 --> 01:06:02.081
You're kidding.

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:06.356
He also said that there was a woman who
saw flashlights on the beach that night.

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:10.297
And then she fell down the stairs,
and now she's in a coma. That's all I know.

01:06:10.366 --> 01:06:13.301
That's all you know? Jesus.

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:20.876
- Can I borrow your phone?
- Why?

01:06:21.544 --> 01:06:23.341
I need to call Adam.

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:31.778
- What?
- Nothing.

01:06:31.854 --> 01:06:35.255
- Aren't you gonna call him?
- Later. I'm going out for a walk.

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:37.918
But it's pitch black. It's pouring with rain.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.019
- It'll clear my head.
- Well, I'll come with you.

01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:43.827
No. Thanks, but I need to work this one
through on my own.

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:46.868
Stay here. Have another drink.
Don't wait up.

01:07:08.557 --> 01:07:10.047
Are you awake?

01:07:11.961 --> 01:07:14.088
- Well, I am now.
- I'm sorry.

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:18.095
It's all right. Hang on.

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:25.566
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:29.433
I called Adam.

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:33.881
- And?
- Can I come in?

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:50.427
The day before Mike died,

01:07:51.267 --> 01:07:53.326
he and Adam had a terrible row.

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:55.495
I've never told anyone this before,
not even the police.

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:57.596
- What about?
- I don't know.

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:02.003
But it was furious. They never spoke again.

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:08.949
When I asked Adam about it,
he refused to discuss it.

01:08:09.952 --> 01:08:14.514
After what you just said,
I felt I should ask him again.

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:16.888
And what did he say?

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:19.788
He was having dinner
with the Vice President.

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:23.354
That bloody Bly woman
wouldn't even give him the phone.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.298
Oh, God. Oh, dear God.

01:08:28.804 --> 01:08:31.033
What's he got himself mixed up in?

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:34.975
It's all right. Everything'll be all right.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:38.478
I'm scared.

01:08:39.747 --> 01:08:43.309
I've never been scared in my life before,
but I am now.

01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:49.283
Your hair's all wet, you're drenched.
Let me get you a towel.

01:09:05.941 --> 01:09:06.930
Bad idea.

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:10.344
Do you mind?

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.578
Course not.

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:14.766
The modesty of the morning after?

01:10:14.843 --> 01:10:16.572
I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep.

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:18.806
You mean you thought I'd be gone?

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:38.327
You've taken out the family tree.
He's very proud of the Langs.

01:10:38.867 --> 01:10:42.598
You know, if you want a family tree,
go to a garden center.

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:47.007
Why have you underlined my name
every time?

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:49.374
I was surprised
there wasn't more about you.

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:51.970
Why? I'm just the wife.

01:10:52.348 --> 01:10:55.181
Yeah, even so.
You ought not to be written out of history.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:57.014
Why not? Most women are.

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.145
Then I'll reinstate you.

01:10:59.822 --> 01:11:01.551
I'll put in all the occasions
that he's forgotten.

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:06.027
How kind. Like the boss's secretary
that remembers his wife's birthday for him?

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:10.429
Something like that. But then,
like you say, I'm not a proper writer.

01:11:10.499 --> 01:11:13.059
- What are you planning to do?
- Leave.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:16.905
It's not necessary, as far as I'm concerned.

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:19.463
I'm afraid it is, as far as I am.

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:22.237
- Where will you go?
- Back to the hotel.

01:11:23.345 --> 01:11:25.973
Look, I'm sorry. I should never have stayed
in a client's house.

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:29.814
- It always ends up with...
- With you screwing the client's wife?

01:11:29.885 --> 01:11:31.853
No, not always.

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:34.649
But it does make it hard
to maintain a professional distance.

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:39.387
And the thing we discussed last night?
What do you propose to do about that?

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:43.192
- That's none of my business.
- Well, you can't just ignore it.

01:11:43.265 --> 01:11:47.429
Look, I'm his ghostwriter.
I'm not an investigative reporter.

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:51.166
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Perhaps I'll write my own memoirs.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.140
<i>Ex-Prime Minister's Wife Tells All.</i>

01:11:53.208 --> 01:11:54.903
Well, if you ever decide to do that,
give me a call.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:57.411
You think I need someone like you
to produce my book?

01:11:57.479 --> 01:12:00.380
I don't want to be in his bloody memoirs.

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:03.745
He's on his own. I'll get a divorce.

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.645
And she can do the prison visits.

01:12:41.223 --> 01:12:42.952
Morning, sir.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:46.119
- Finished for the night, have we?
- Why don't you just piss off?

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:40.147
<i>BMW ConnectedDrive.</i>

01:13:40.215 --> 01:13:42.274
<i>Traffic is clear to your destination.</i>

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:02.061
<i>Join the road when possible.</i>

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:23.119
<i>In 200 yards, turn left.</i>

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:26.183
Sorry, lady, but the hotel is right.

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:32.395
<i>Turn around when possible.</i>

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:34.595
This is getting ridiculous.

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:57.353
<i>Turn around when possible.</i>

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:59.189
All right, you win.

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:16.443
<i>In 50 yards, turn left.</i>

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:25.476
<i>Turn left.</i>

01:15:26.655 --> 01:15:28.714
You've got to be joking.

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:44.769
Single or return?

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.774
Return. I hope.

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:49.739
Forty bucks, please.

01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:52.475
- Have a good one.
- Ta.

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:18.971
Okay, come on. Come on, keep coming.

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:21.376
A little more. Stop.

01:16:51.039 --> 01:16:53.633
<i>In 50 yards, turn left.</i>

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:04.145
<i>Please proceed to the indicated road.</i>

01:17:04.219 --> 01:17:07.279
<i>In 200 yards, take the next exit.</i>

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:11.121
<i>In half a mile, make a sharp right turn.</i>

01:17:11.326 --> 01:17:12.691
<i>Turn left.</i>

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:17.896
<i>In 200 yards,</i>
<i>you will have reached your destination.</i>

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.508
<i>You have reached your destination.</i>

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:38.812
Paul Emmett?

01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:44.851
Professor Paul Emmett?

01:18:49.257 --> 01:18:51.885
"Professor Paul Emmett
of Harvard University

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:54.394
"has written of the unique importance
of the English-speaking peoples

01:18:54.463 --> 01:18:56.863
"in the spread of democracy
around the world.

01:18:56.932 --> 01:18:59.093
"As these nations stand together,

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:02.967
"whenever they have faltered,
tyranny has gathered strength."

01:19:48.416 --> 01:19:49.508
<i>Hello?</i>

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:51.575
- Is that Mrs. Emmett?
<i>- Who is this?</i>

01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:53.950
I wondered if I might have a word
with Professor Emmett.

01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:55.353
<i>Do you have an appointment?</i>

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:59.052
It's about Adam Lang.
I'm assisting him with his memoirs.

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:01.462
<i>Just a moment, please.</i>

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:08.067
<i>This is Paul Emmett.</i>
<i>I think you must have made a mistake.</i>

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:10.400
But you were at Cambridge with Mr. Lang?

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:14.602
<i>We were contemporaries, yes,</i>
<i>but I can't claim to know him.</i>

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:17.236
I have a photograph of you together.

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:20.275
<i>Come on up to the house.</i>

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:53.143
I make it a rule never to see anyone
without an appointment.

01:20:53.615 --> 01:20:57.449
But your mention of a photograph
rather tickled my curiosity.

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:02.885
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:05.483
Yes, he's here now.

01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:08.790
- May I?
- Sure.

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:11.597
Yes. Yes, he's on his own.

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:13.991
He didn't say.

01:21:14.736 --> 01:21:16.533
British, about 40.

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:20.507
Well, well.
I literally have no recollection of this.

01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:22.536
- But that is you?
- Yes, it is.

01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:25.808
I was on the board of the Dramat.
I had quite a time of it, as you can imagine.

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:30.011
- The Dramat?
- I'm sorry. The Yale Dramatic Association.

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:32.053
I maintained my theatrical interests

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:35.419
when I went to Cambridge
for my doctoral research.

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:39.822
- Could I keep this?
- No, I'm afraid not.

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:43.991
- I'm sure I could get you a copy.
- Would you? That would be kind.

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.431
Maybe you could tell me
how you came by it.

01:21:47.502 --> 01:21:49.163
I'd be happy to.

01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:53.804
Come into my study.

01:21:58.213 --> 01:22:00.681
Yes, the wall of ego.

01:22:01.449 --> 01:22:04.782
We all have one.
It's our equivalent of the dentist's fish tank.

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:08.788
Have a seat.

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:18.690
So, the picture.

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:19.859
Um...

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:22.927
I've been working with Adam Lang
on his memoirs.

01:22:23.004 --> 01:22:25.063
Yes, I know, you told me.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:29.974
Yes, poor Lang. It's bad business,
this posturing by The Hague.

01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:33.878
As for Rycart, the worst
British Foreign Secretary since the war.

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:35.075
Lang was right to fire him.

01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:38.017
- How well do you know Lang?
- Hardly at all.

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:42.519
- You seem surprised.
- He mentions you in his memoirs.

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:43.852
Oh, really?

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:49.296
Well, now it's my turn to be surprised.
What does he say?

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:09.749
That's very decent of him.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:13.151
As Prime Minister,
he always had good instincts.

01:23:13.888 --> 01:23:15.355
- But that doesn't mean I know him.
- But the...

01:23:15.423 --> 01:23:18.449
That. That was taken at a reception
in London

01:23:18.893 --> 01:23:21.521
to mark the 10-year anniversary
of the Arcadia.

01:23:21.596 --> 01:23:24.030
- Arcadia?
- Yeah, it's a little organization that I ran.

01:23:24.099 --> 01:23:26.863
Very highbrow.
No reason why you should have heard of it.

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:30.029
The Prime Minister graced us
with his presence.

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:33.766
What can you remember of him
from Cambridge?

01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:38.043
- I'm sorry, you don't mind, do you?
- No, not at all. Go ahead.

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:40.604
It's just that I'm rather bewildered.

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:44.049
No one's mentioned the Cambridge
connection between us in all these years.

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:47.748
- But you performed together?
- In one production.

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:52.121
It was the summer revue.
I can't even remember what it was called.

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:55.754
- Can I show you something else?
- Lf you must.

01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:05.604
Oh, my.

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:09.135
Is that what I think it is?

01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:11.203
Let's hope he didn't inhale.

01:24:11.279 --> 01:24:13.144
But that is you standing behind him,
isn't it?

01:24:13.214 --> 01:24:14.704
I do believe it is.

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:17.877
And I do believe I'm on the point
of issuing a stern warning to him

01:24:17.952 --> 01:24:20.182
on the perils of drug abuse.

01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:25.192
Is Mr. Lang really going to use
these pictures in his memoirs?

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:28.195
If so, I would prefer it if I weren't named.

01:24:28.596 --> 01:24:30.291
My children would be mortified.

01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:32.890
They're so much more puritanical
than we were.

01:24:32.967 --> 01:24:36.801
- Can you tell me about any of the others?
- No, I'm afraid not.

01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:40.301
The whole summer is a blur,
a very happy blur.

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:45.410
Now, you were going to tell me
about these pictures.

01:24:46.081 --> 01:24:48.311
I got them from Michael McAra.

01:24:49.184 --> 01:24:51.778
And he is whom, exactly?

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:54.321
My predecessor on Lang's memoirs.

01:24:55.123 --> 01:24:57.683
- He resigned?
- No, he died.

01:24:58.593 --> 01:24:59.992
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:25:00.061 --> 01:25:03.690
Yes, a couple of weeks ago.
He drove up here to see you.

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:05.659
And he died a few hours afterwards.

01:25:05.733 --> 01:25:09.191
He drove up to see me?
No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:12.964
- How did he die?
- He drowned.

01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:14.440
Poor fellow.

01:25:15.577 --> 01:25:20.344
I've never really believed the myth that
death by drowning is painless, have you?

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:22.906
Seems to me it must be agonizing.

01:25:23.518 --> 01:25:25.452
And the police never said anything to you
about this?

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.988
I've had no contact with the police.

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:29.819
But were you here that weekend?

01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:32.121
This would have been
January, the 11th and 12th.

01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:40.200
A less equable man than I might start
to find your questions impertinent.

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:46.570
Nancy?

01:25:48.776 --> 01:25:49.936
Nancy?

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:54.480
Our visitor wishes to know where we were
on the 11th and 12th of January.

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:56.915
Do we possess that information?

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:06.453
That was the Colorado weekend.

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:10.393
Yes, of course, the Aspen Institute.

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:14.127
Bipolar relationships in a multi-polar world.

01:26:14.202 --> 01:26:17.467
- Sounds fun.
- Yes, it was. I was the main speaker.

01:26:17.539 --> 01:26:19.006
Look, just to return to Cambridge...

01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:22.565
No, if you don't mind,
let's not return to Cambridge.

01:26:23.044 --> 01:26:25.979
I've said all I have to say on that subject.

01:26:27.549 --> 01:26:31.645
I'm an avid reader of political memoirs.
I'll get hold of Mr. Lang's when they appear.

01:26:31.719 --> 01:26:34.654
Perhaps he'll send you a copy,
for old time's sake.

01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:36.349
I doubt that very much.

01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:38.581
The gate will open automatically.

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:42.255
Be sure to make a right
when you get to the end of the drive.

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:44.958
If you turn left, the road
will take you deeper into the woods

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:47.399
and you may never be seen again.

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:10.821
<i>BMW ConnectedDrive.</i>

01:29:25.827 --> 01:29:27.226
When is the last ferry?

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:30.287
- You're just in time.
- Here, I've got a return.

01:29:30.365 --> 01:29:31.730
All right.

01:30:22.483 --> 01:30:23.677
- Ticket?
- Uh...

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:26.880
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:30:58.653 --> 01:30:59.950
Shit.

01:32:13.227 --> 01:32:14.592
Hey, you! Stop!

01:32:14.662 --> 01:32:16.687
Don't do that! Where you going?

01:32:16.764 --> 01:32:20.165
Man, get out of here!
Get out of here, asshole!

01:32:22.103 --> 01:32:23.229
Shit!

01:33:09.684 --> 01:33:12.551
<i>You've reached the office</i>
<i>of Rick Ricardelli. Leave a message.</i>

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:13.882
Piss off.

01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:29.536
What can I do for you, sir?

01:33:29.604 --> 01:33:31.435
You wouldn't happen to know
if there are any flights leaving

01:33:31.505 --> 01:33:32.563
the airport tonight, would you?

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.574
Not unless you've got your own private jet.

01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:36.610
I lent it to my butler.

01:33:36.677 --> 01:33:38.235
You Brits!

01:33:40.081 --> 01:33:42.174
There's a flight to Boston

01:33:42.249 --> 01:33:44.149
- 8:30 tomorrow morning.
- Shit!

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:48.521
- How much for a room?
- For you, $89.

01:33:49.824 --> 01:33:52.691
- I'll pay cash.
- Who's got your card? The nanny?

01:34:29.096 --> 01:34:30.586
<i>You rang back.</i>

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:35.668
<i>Are you going to stay on the line this time?</i>

01:34:35.736 --> 01:34:36.794
Yes.

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:39.206
<i>I've been trying to call you.</i>

01:34:40.274 --> 01:34:42.003
I know, I'm sorry...

01:34:43.644 --> 01:34:45.771
It didn't seem right, speaking to you.

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:47.612
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:34:48.449 --> 01:34:51.213
I'm the new ghostwriter...

01:34:51.285 --> 01:34:53.515
<i>No names, don't use any names.</i>

01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:56.052
<i>How did you get this number?</i>

01:34:57.558 --> 01:35:01.858
It was in my predecessor's effects.

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:04.356
The...

01:35:05.199 --> 01:35:07.258
The thing is, I'm in trouble.

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:09.234
<i>Is it because of your client?</i>

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:11.330
Yeah.

01:35:12.073 --> 01:35:14.735
There's something wrong,
but I didn't know who to talk to.

01:35:14.809 --> 01:35:18.074
<i>Where are you? Without being too specific.</i>
<i>On the island?</i>

01:35:18.145 --> 01:35:23.515
I'm in the... No, I'm on the mainland,
on the... This motel by the ferry.

01:35:23.584 --> 01:35:24.983
<i>Room number?</i>

01:35:29.623 --> 01:35:30.783
201.

01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:33.190
<i>- Have you got the book with you?</i>
- Yeah.

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:34.887
<i>Okay. Stay there.</i>

01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:31.081
Hatherton?

01:36:50.237 --> 01:36:53.900
<i>With $35 billion of funds at its disposal,</i>

01:36:53.974 --> 01:36:56.704
<i>the Hatherton Group brings together</i>
<i>a family of companies</i>

01:36:56.777 --> 01:36:59.245
<i>devoted to defense and security.</i>

01:36:59.313 --> 01:37:01.804
<i>And with unrivaled expertise</i>
<i>in the Middle East,</i>

01:37:01.882 --> 01:37:04.646
<i>including the services</i>
<i>of two former Presidents,</i>

01:37:04.718 --> 01:37:08.518
<i>three Prime Ministers</i>
<i>and two directors of the CIA,</i>

01:37:08.589 --> 01:37:13.151
<i>Hatherton is proud to stand at the forefront</i>
<i>of the struggle against terror.</i>

01:37:15.996 --> 01:37:18.328
<i>Hatherton, a shelter from harm.</i>

01:37:58.005 --> 01:38:01.532
"According to CIA whistleblower
Frank Molinari,

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:03.668
"Yale graduate Paul Emmett

01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:07.646
"was reported to have joined the Agency
as an officer in 1971,

01:38:08.148 --> 01:38:12.050
"and was assigned to the Foreign
Resources Division of the Directorate of..."

01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:14.151
1971?

01:38:16.323 --> 01:38:18.018
It's 1974.

01:38:34.708 --> 01:38:36.471
- Hello?
- <i>You're alive.</i>

01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:39.303
Yeah, just about.

01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:41.075
<i>I've been worried sick.</i>

01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:44.549
<i>The police called to say</i>
<i>they'd found the car on the ferry. Again!</i>

01:38:44.618 --> 01:38:48.918
I'm so sorry. I parked it,
and then, and then I got off the boat.

01:38:48.989 --> 01:38:51.958
<i>What the hell were you doing</i>
<i>on the mainland, anyway?</i>

01:38:52.026 --> 01:38:54.654
- I drove to New York.
<i>- Why?</i>

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:58.023
I needed to see John Maddox.

01:38:58.265 --> 01:38:59.926
<i>And where are you now?</i>

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.731
I'm still at the ferry terminal.
I missed the last crossing.

01:39:04.038 --> 01:39:06.097
<i>You really are bloody hopeless!</i>

01:39:06.173 --> 01:39:09.472
<i>I just had Adam on the phone,</i>
<i>trying to get hold of you.</i>

01:39:09.543 --> 01:39:13.138
<i>He's flying back tonight.</i>
<i>He sounds in a right state.</i>

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:15.676
<i>You didn't tell him about us, did you?</i>

01:39:15.749 --> 01:39:16.807
God's sake, Ruth!

01:39:18.218 --> 01:39:20.709
I've got to go. I'll call you back.

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:29.126
- Who is it?
- Mr. Rycart sent me.

01:39:30.097 --> 01:39:31.291
Hold on.

01:40:01.161 --> 01:40:03.789
Just gonna do a quick check,
if you don't mind.

01:40:17.945 --> 01:40:20.106
Get your stuff together. We're leaving.

01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:26.151
Hey! That's private!

01:40:49.043 --> 01:40:51.136
- He's clean.
- Thanks, Frank.

01:40:55.482 --> 01:40:58.451
Sorry about that. Please, get in.

01:41:14.435 --> 01:41:17.598
- You thought it was a trap?
- It crossed my mind.

01:41:17.671 --> 01:41:18.899
You do work for Lang.

01:41:18.972 --> 01:41:20.963
Yeah, for three days. I hardly know the guy.

01:41:21.041 --> 01:41:25.842
Who does? I worked for him for 15 years,
till he fired me, and I still can't fathom him.

01:41:25.913 --> 01:41:27.813
Yeah, his wife said more or less the same.

01:41:27.881 --> 01:41:32.477
There you go. If someone as sharp as Ruth
can't get him, what hope do we have?

01:41:32.553 --> 01:41:35.147
- Tough day?
- Yeah, you could say that.

01:41:35.556 --> 01:41:37.114
You have the book?

01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:39.083
Yeah.

01:41:39.593 --> 01:41:40.992
He's got it.

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:52.536
Before we go any further, I wonder
if I might take a look at that book.

01:41:57.077 --> 01:42:01.639
No. Before we go any further,
there's a few things I'd like to know first.

01:42:01.715 --> 01:42:04.616
Such as,
why did Mike McAra have your number?

01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:10.621
Okay. Sure.

01:42:11.425 --> 01:42:12.892
He was helping me.

01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:14.920
McAra? How?

01:42:14.995 --> 01:42:18.556
Mike found the documents linking Lang
to the torture flights.

01:42:18.632 --> 01:42:20.259
What? It was McAra
who gave you the documents?

01:42:20.334 --> 01:42:24.600
- Yeah, Mike McAra. The loyalest of the loyal.
- But why?

01:42:24.671 --> 01:42:28.232
He didn't like discovering
he was working for a war criminal.

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:29.605
Would you?

01:42:30.544 --> 01:42:32.409
Oh, I forgot. You are.

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:35.943
The book?

01:43:05.679 --> 01:43:07.146
Well, don't tell me
you're gonna read it now.

01:43:07.214 --> 01:43:09.614
Not all of it. Just the beginning.

01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:12.377
There's something very important about it.

01:43:12.452 --> 01:43:14.977
Yeah. It's the cure for insomnia.

01:43:15.055 --> 01:43:18.149
There you go, guys.
Can I get you anything else?

01:43:18.225 --> 01:43:19.817
No, thanks, love.

01:43:23.897 --> 01:43:28.425
Mike said he'd discovered something new.
It's the last time he called me.

01:43:28.802 --> 01:43:32.260
He said it explained everything that had
gone wrong when we were in government.

01:43:32.339 --> 01:43:35.035
- What was it?
- He wouldn't say over the phone.

01:43:35.108 --> 01:43:39.943
He just kept saying if anything happened
to him, the truth was in Lang's memoirs.

01:43:40.314 --> 01:43:41.975
"It's all there in the beginning."

01:43:42.049 --> 01:43:43.573
The beginning?

01:43:44.685 --> 01:43:46.653
Then he means Cambridge.

01:43:58.532 --> 01:43:59.829
What the hell's this?

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:02.698
That is Lang, and that is Paul Emmett.

01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:06.062
Emmett? The Arcadia guy. So what?

01:44:06.139 --> 01:44:09.802
On the day that Mike McAra died,
he drove up to see Emmett,

01:44:10.244 --> 01:44:12.144
and I think he was murdered
on his way home.

01:44:12.212 --> 01:44:13.577
- What?
- I went to see Emmett today,

01:44:13.647 --> 01:44:16.878
and two guys followed me from his house.
That's why I called you.

01:44:18.118 --> 01:44:20.586
At the time that this photograph was taken,

01:44:21.154 --> 01:44:25.090
Paul Emmett was an officer in the CIA.

01:44:25.592 --> 01:44:26.616
Emmett?

01:44:26.693 --> 01:44:29.662
- Foreign Resources Division.
- Oh, my God.

01:44:31.298 --> 01:44:33.994
You realize how important this is,
don't you?

01:44:34.434 --> 01:44:37.301
This explains why Lang went into politics.

01:44:37.804 --> 01:44:41.604
Everyone knows he didn't have
a political thought in his pretty little head.

01:44:42.175 --> 01:44:46.874
This is why he rose so quickly,
with a little help from his friends.

01:44:47.481 --> 01:44:49.711
- Well, do you think it's possible...
- Okay, a quiz for you.

01:44:49.783 --> 01:44:53.219
Name one decision Lang made in 10 years
as Prime Minister

01:44:53.287 --> 01:44:56.051
which wasn't in the interests of the USA.

01:44:57.758 --> 01:45:00.556
Well, come on, it's not a trick question.

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:04.791
Iraq, Middle East policy, Star Wars defense,

01:45:05.699 --> 01:45:09.191
buying American nuclear missiles,
support of terrorist rendition.

01:45:09.269 --> 01:45:12.898
The sacking of any minister
Washington didn't like,

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:15.271
including yours truly.

01:45:15.876 --> 01:45:17.468
McAra was right.

01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:19.411
This explains everything.

01:45:24.251 --> 01:45:25.843
It's Amelia Bly.

01:45:26.353 --> 01:45:27.684
Answer it.

01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:33.123
- Hello, Amelia.
<i>- Good evening. I have Adam for you.</i>

01:45:34.461 --> 01:45:35.621
Lang.

01:45:35.962 --> 01:45:37.554
<i>We're coming to get you.</i>

01:45:37.631 --> 01:45:38.757
What?

01:45:39.199 --> 01:45:41.599
<i>Ruth tells me</i>
<i>you're stuck at the ferry terminal.</i>

01:45:41.668 --> 01:45:43.761
<i>We've just taken off from New York.</i>

01:45:43.837 --> 01:45:46.635
<i>Pilot says we can stop by and pick you up.</i>

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:49.435
Really? There's no need.

01:45:49.509 --> 01:45:51.739
<i>We've got a book to write, remember?</i>

01:45:53.413 --> 01:45:55.040
Hold on a sec, Adam.

01:45:57.084 --> 01:45:59.814
He said he wants to
pick me up in his private jet.

01:45:59.886 --> 01:46:01.786
- Say yes.
- What if it's a trap?

01:46:01.855 --> 01:46:05.086
If you refuse, he'll get suspicious.
Tell him yes.

01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:11.420
That'd be great, Adam. Yeah, thanks.
I'll get to the airport.

01:46:11.965 --> 01:46:13.432
<i>See you there.</i>

01:46:15.469 --> 01:46:17.130
He sounds worried.

01:46:18.605 --> 01:46:20.163
I really don't think this is a good idea.

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:21.434
You have no choice.

01:46:21.508 --> 01:46:23.533
Emmett must have told Lang
that I'd been to see him.

01:46:23.610 --> 01:46:25.976
So, what's he gonna do about it?
Dump you in the ocean?

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:28.844
- Well, it happened before!
- Which means it can't happen again.

01:46:28.915 --> 01:46:33.113
He can't drown two ghostwriters,
for God's sake. You're not kittens.

01:46:35.756 --> 01:46:38.350
All this is just theory.
We don't have any proof.

01:46:38.425 --> 01:46:40.620
- You'll get us the proof.
- Me?

01:46:40.694 --> 01:46:43.219
You're his ghostwriter.
Presumably, he lets you tape him.

01:46:43.296 --> 01:46:45.526
- I use discs, actually.
- Discs, tapes.

01:46:45.599 --> 01:46:47.897
You've got to confront him with this.
Record his reaction.

01:46:47.968 --> 01:46:49.697
Even if he denies it, it's something.

01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:53.900
I'm in a tricky position here.
I signed a confidentiality agreement.

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:55.032
It's a bit late for that.

01:46:55.108 --> 01:46:58.373
- It means the discs are his property.
- The court can subpoena them.

01:46:59.146 --> 01:47:01.740
And what if I don't record any discs?

01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:04.443
Then you'll be subpoenaed
and forced to repeat this whole story.

01:47:04.518 --> 01:47:05.610
Then I'll deny it.

01:47:05.685 --> 01:47:07.676
Then I'll give them this.

01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:12.417
Frank is recording every word.

01:47:12.492 --> 01:47:14.119
Aren't you, Frank?

01:47:17.697 --> 01:47:19.187
Oh! Come on!

01:47:19.266 --> 01:47:21.097
Don't look so shocked.
What did you expect?

01:47:21.168 --> 01:47:23.568
That I'd come into a meeting
with a man working for Lang

01:47:23.637 --> 01:47:25.832
without taking any precautions?

01:47:26.473 --> 01:47:29.203
Except you're not working
for Lang anymore.

01:47:29.276 --> 01:47:31.176
You're working for the good guys.

01:47:32.913 --> 01:47:35.074
You know all this is pointless, don't you?

01:47:35.615 --> 01:47:38.846
In the end, he'll just retire over here
with his CIA pension,

01:47:38.919 --> 01:47:42.582
and he'll tell you and the bloody
war crimes court to go and fuck yourselves.

01:47:56.236 --> 01:47:59.399
Good evening, sir.
Hatherton welcomes you aboard.

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.137
Thank you.

01:48:02.576 --> 01:48:04.441
It's my first time in a private jet.

01:48:04.511 --> 01:48:06.376
Well, let's hope it's not your last.

01:48:18.425 --> 01:48:19.653
Hi, man.

01:48:20.861 --> 01:48:22.829
- Take your seat.
- Thanks.

01:48:24.231 --> 01:48:27.723
- Hey, bring my ghost a Calvados.
- Yes, sir.

01:48:49.022 --> 01:48:50.216
Do you mind?

01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:52.087
Leave it off for now.

01:48:52.659 --> 01:48:55.594
Ruth said you were in New York
to see Maddox.

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:58.895
- That's right.
- How was he?

01:48:59.766 --> 01:49:00.824
He was fine.

01:49:00.901 --> 01:49:02.391
Full of energy?

01:49:02.702 --> 01:49:05.193
- You know John.
- Yes, I do know John.

01:49:06.606 --> 01:49:09.336
As a matter of fact, I was just with him.

01:49:09.409 --> 01:49:11.809
You never saw him today, did you?

01:49:13.713 --> 01:49:14.771
No.

01:49:15.448 --> 01:49:17.313
Do you have something to tell me?

01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:19.147
I went to see Emmett.

01:49:19.252 --> 01:49:22.517
That windbag! Why?

01:49:22.589 --> 01:49:24.022
I know about you and Emmett.

01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:26.058
- Me and Emmett?
- I know that he was your...

01:49:26.126 --> 01:49:28.822
- My?
...handler, if that's what they're called.

01:49:28.895 --> 01:49:32.524
- My handler?
- Yeah, that he was your handler in the CIA.

01:49:43.443 --> 01:49:45.570
Oh, my God.

01:49:47.614 --> 01:49:49.707
You're serious, aren't you?

01:49:58.091 --> 01:50:01.788
When McAra found this,
he went to Boston to show it to Emmett,

01:50:01.861 --> 01:50:05.422
and he died on the way home,
and I think he was murdered.

01:50:05.999 --> 01:50:08.797
I think you've had a few too many
of those already.

01:50:08.868 --> 01:50:13.100
It was McAra who believed that Emmett told
you to go into politics in the first place.

01:50:13.173 --> 01:50:15.300
- Emmett? I barely knew the man.
- And that story of yours

01:50:15.375 --> 01:50:19.209
about why you joined the party and Ruth
and the canvassing, well, the dates don't fit.

01:50:19.279 --> 01:50:21.110
I got the dates wrong. Big deal!

01:50:21.181 --> 01:50:22.648
Then when he found this photograph,

01:50:22.716 --> 01:50:24.843
and he heard the rumors
about Emmett being in the CIA...

01:50:24.918 --> 01:50:26.715
- Rumors?
- It's on the Internet.

01:50:26.786 --> 01:50:30.085
I've never heard such utter balls
in my entire life.

01:50:31.658 --> 01:50:36.652
Mike would never have believed such crap.
He was too clever. Too loyal.

01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:39.457
Mike betrayed you to Rycart.

01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:45.967
- How do you know that?
- He told me.

01:50:46.906 --> 01:50:48.066
Rycart?

01:50:50.076 --> 01:50:51.407
He's lying.

01:50:56.182 --> 01:50:59.618
This phone number on the back
of the photograph, it's Rycart's.

01:51:00.253 --> 01:51:03.450
The handwriting, that's McAra's.

01:51:04.157 --> 01:51:05.249
Mike.

01:51:07.227 --> 01:51:09.855
- Mike, Mike.
- And you knew he was disillusioned.

01:51:09.929 --> 01:51:11.556
You had a big row with him
just before he died.

01:51:11.631 --> 01:51:15.658
Yes, I know, but he never mentioned this.
This is just... This is grotesque.

01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:18.897
I've never taken orders from anyone.

01:51:18.972 --> 01:51:22.032
Whatever I did,
I did because I believed it was right.

01:51:22.108 --> 01:51:24.702
What, even supporting illegal kidnapping
for torture?

01:51:24.778 --> 01:51:28.737
Oh, for God's sake,
spare me the bleeding-heart bullshit!

01:51:28.815 --> 01:51:30.806
Do you know what I'd do
if I was in power again?

01:51:30.884 --> 01:51:32.977
I'd have two queues at airports.

01:51:33.053 --> 01:51:36.022
One for flights
where we'd done no background checks,

01:51:36.089 --> 01:51:40.958
infringed on no one's civil bloody liberties,
used no intelligence gained by torture.

01:51:41.027 --> 01:51:44.519
And on the other flight,
we'd do everything we possibly could

01:51:44.597 --> 01:51:46.292
to make it perfectly safe.

01:51:46.366 --> 01:51:49.164
And then we'd see which plane
the Rycarts of this world

01:51:49.235 --> 01:51:50.998
would put their bloody kids on!

01:51:51.071 --> 01:51:52.868
And you can put that in the book!

01:52:19.499 --> 01:52:20.727
Go home!

01:52:21.234 --> 01:52:22.758
Go home!

01:52:24.003 --> 01:52:25.868
Here comes the killer!

01:52:25.939 --> 01:52:28.737
Prosecute for torture!

01:52:28.808 --> 01:52:30.275
Over here, Mr. Lang!

01:52:30.343 --> 01:52:33.642
Mr. Lang!
Mr. Lang, will you live in America?

01:52:36.182 --> 01:52:38.673
Mr. Lang, will you take
American citizenship?

01:52:43.389 --> 01:52:46.290
When we get back to the house,
we need to have a meeting.

01:52:49.295 --> 01:52:51.195
- Oh, my God!
- Murderer!

01:52:51.264 --> 01:52:52.731
Firing from the roof!

01:52:57.904 --> 01:53:01.931
Let me go to him! No! No!

01:53:05.178 --> 01:53:06.805
Move, move, move!

01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:48.851
How long had you known Mr. Lang?

01:53:48.922 --> 01:53:51.447
- Couple of days.
- In what capacity?

01:53:51.524 --> 01:53:53.219
I was his ghost.

01:53:53.293 --> 01:53:54.885
His ghostwriter.

01:53:56.729 --> 01:53:58.492
Do you recognize this man?

01:54:00.166 --> 01:54:04.125
He was one of the protestors.
His son was killed in Iraq.

01:54:04.204 --> 01:54:06.138
Did you ever speak with him?

01:54:06.206 --> 01:54:08.731
He was in the bar one night
in the hotel where I was staying.

01:54:08.808 --> 01:54:10.537
But did you speak with him?

01:54:10.610 --> 01:54:12.771
He asked me if I knew where Adam Lang
was staying on the island.

01:54:12.846 --> 01:54:16.282
- I told him that I didn't.
- Did you report this conversation?

01:54:16.349 --> 01:54:17.373
Sorry?

01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:19.975
Did you report this conversation
to Mr. Lang's protection team?

01:54:20.053 --> 01:54:21.077
No.

01:54:21.421 --> 01:54:23.651
What was Mr. Lang's demeanor
this evening?

01:54:23.723 --> 01:54:26.954
He was... He was fine. He seemed fine.

01:54:27.894 --> 01:54:30.988
One witness said she thought
she heard Mr. Lang shouting at you.

01:54:31.664 --> 01:54:32.722
No.

01:55:00.526 --> 01:55:02.960
- We're gonna need your passport.
- Why?

01:55:03.029 --> 01:55:06.931
A serious crime was just committed
in US territory, and you're the key witness.

01:55:13.206 --> 01:55:14.935
We need to keep you close.

01:55:19.913 --> 01:55:23.576
<i>Like a fallen soldier,</i>
<i>Adam Lang went home today,</i>

01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:26.312
<i>home to a shocked and grieving nation.</i>

01:55:26.819 --> 01:55:32.052
<i>Not just his family, but friends</i>
<i>and political opponents joined in tribute.</i>

01:55:32.125 --> 01:55:35.390
<i>A great colleague and a true patriot.</i>

01:55:36.129 --> 01:55:40.156
<i>We had our disagreements,</i>
<i>but we always stayed friends.</i>

01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:42.665
<i>My heart goes out to Ruth and the family.</i>

01:55:44.304 --> 01:55:46.966
<i>And I would like to say Adam will be...</i>

01:55:55.648 --> 01:55:56.740
Who is it?

01:55:56.816 --> 01:55:58.408
Congratulations!

01:56:00.453 --> 01:56:01.579
On what now?

01:56:01.654 --> 01:56:03.884
Still having me as your agent. Hmm?

01:56:06.059 --> 01:56:07.890
They don't need you anymore.

01:56:09.862 --> 01:56:11.659
You're free to go.

01:56:16.869 --> 01:56:19.963
- You ready to get back to work?
- I don't think I can, Rick.

01:56:20.039 --> 01:56:22.735
- I'm sorry. Not after all this.
- Don't be a jerk.

01:56:22.809 --> 01:56:27.576
This is a hot book now.
It's Adam Lang's voice from the grave.

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:30.309
- The guy, he's a hero.
- I just want to go home.

01:56:30.383 --> 01:56:31.680
You can.

01:56:31.751 --> 01:56:35.448
Go. Go home.
And finish the book from London.

01:56:39.025 --> 01:56:40.515
I don't know, Rick.

01:57:04.817 --> 01:57:06.216
Here we are.

01:57:06.652 --> 01:57:08.244
Oh, here we are.

01:57:19.966 --> 01:57:21.297
I'm sorry.

01:57:22.268 --> 01:57:25.533
I think I'm over it,
and then suddenly I realize I'm not.

01:57:27.106 --> 01:57:30.940
- Are you sure this is all right?
- Of course. My invitation said plus one.

01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:34.070
Only I wondered if you might've wanted
to bring your husband.

01:57:34.147 --> 01:57:35.637
That didn't work out.

01:57:36.082 --> 01:57:39.984
I hadn't appreciated quite how bored
he was with being my plus one.

01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:46.390
- Shall we go in?
- Yeah.

01:57:53.099 --> 01:57:55.499
- Amelia Bly, plus one.
- Thank you.

01:58:00.606 --> 01:58:02.870
That was a bit of a turn-up, for the books,
you calling me.

01:58:02.942 --> 01:58:04.933
I heard you weren't invited,
and I thought you should be here.

01:58:05.011 --> 01:58:07.241
Ghosts are never invited
to the launch party, as a rule.

01:58:07.313 --> 01:58:10.339
We're an embarrassment.
Like a mistress at a wedding.

01:58:11.918 --> 01:58:13.078
Sorry.

01:58:14.887 --> 01:58:16.582
I brought you a present.

01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:20.055
Thank you.

01:58:28.101 --> 01:58:30.535
That's very funny.

01:58:30.603 --> 01:58:32.366
I thought, seeing as
you were so keen to hold onto it,

01:58:32.438 --> 01:58:33.735
you might like it as a souvenir.

01:58:33.806 --> 01:58:36.707
Between you and me, it wasn't us,
it was the Americans.

01:58:36.776 --> 01:58:40.212
They thought the book was
a potential threat to national security.

01:58:40.279 --> 01:58:41.337
But there's nothing in it.

01:58:41.414 --> 01:58:44.440
Something about the beginnings.
I think that's what I heard.

01:58:44.517 --> 01:58:47.645
- The beginning?
- No, beginnings. The beginnings.

01:58:49.422 --> 01:58:50.446
Beginnings?

01:59:01.067 --> 01:59:02.557
You all right?

01:59:03.269 --> 01:59:06.136
Do you know that man?
The one who's speaking to Ruth.

01:59:06.339 --> 01:59:08.899
- Paul Emmett?
- What's he doing here?

01:59:08.975 --> 01:59:11.671
Well, he was Ruth's tutor at Harvard
when she was a Fulbright scholar.

01:59:11.744 --> 01:59:13.336
Why shouldn't he be here?

01:59:19.051 --> 01:59:21.281
Do you mind if I have that back a second?

01:59:25.124 --> 01:59:26.386
I'm...

01:59:30.796 --> 01:59:32.661
- Madam?
- No, thank you.

01:59:55.054 --> 01:59:57.079
"Langs are Scottish folk, originally."

02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:10.792
"Wife and child in tow, I decided to...

02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:12.794
"I decided to settle."

02:00:12.872 --> 02:00:16.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention, please.

02:00:17.343 --> 02:00:21.712
Thank you.
I'd like to ask Ruth Lang to say a few words.

02:00:25.851 --> 02:00:27.876
I miss Adam all the time.

02:00:29.488 --> 02:00:31.251
But never more than tonight.

02:00:31.724 --> 02:00:34.659
Not just 'cause we're meeting
to launch his wonderful new book

02:00:34.727 --> 02:00:38.322
and he should be here to share
the joy of his life story with us,

02:00:39.131 --> 02:00:43.090
but because he was so brilliant
at making speeches

02:00:44.036 --> 02:00:45.503
and I'm so terrible.

02:00:46.272 --> 02:00:48.206
"Langs are Scottish folk."

02:00:48.941 --> 02:00:50.772
"Wife and child, Langs are Scottish."

02:00:51.310 --> 02:00:53.301
"Wife, Langs. Lang's wife."

02:00:54.647 --> 02:00:55.978
"Lang's

02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:59.682
"wife Ruth

02:01:00.987 --> 02:01:03.114
"was recruited

02:01:03.956 --> 02:01:10.191
"as a CIA agent

02:01:11.197 --> 02:01:15.497
"by Professor Paul Emmett
of Harvard University."

02:01:18.971 --> 02:01:21.633
Well, you'll be relieved to hear
I'm not making a speech this evening.

02:01:21.707 --> 02:01:23.834
I just want to thank
our wonderful publishers,

02:01:23.909 --> 02:01:26.469
Marty Rhinehart and John Maddox,

02:01:26.545 --> 02:01:29.742
and our attorney and friend, Sidney Kroll.

02:01:30.816 --> 02:01:36.618
And finally, but especially, Mike McAra.

02:01:36.822 --> 02:01:39.347
Mike, our thoughts are with you.

02:01:40.159 --> 02:01:44.960
In these very difficult few months,
I've drawn great comfort from this book,

02:01:45.031 --> 02:01:49.866
from knowing that, despite the terrible
double tragedy of losing both of them,

02:01:50.369 --> 02:01:54.203
Mike and Adam did at least live long
enough to complete it.

02:01:55.041 --> 02:01:58.977
And I really believe that,
as people read these pages,

02:01:59.045 --> 02:02:03.072
Adam's voice will keep on coming through
for generations to come,

02:02:03.182 --> 02:02:05.776
eloquent, strong and full of hope.

02:02:06.519 --> 02:02:10.046
Thanks to his words, he is with us still.

02:02:11.524 --> 02:02:15.517
If I've left out anyone's name,
I hope you'll forgive me.

02:02:18.898 --> 02:02:20.991
But now I must make a toast.

02:02:21.467 --> 02:02:24.300
To the memory of a great man

02:02:25.638 --> 02:02:28.106
and a great patriot,

02:02:28.174 --> 02:02:30.938
a wonderful husband and a devoted father.

02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:31.999
To Adam!

02:02:32.078 --> 02:02:33.545
To Adam!

02:03:07.613 --> 02:03:09.342
You were marvelous.

02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:12.612
Would you...

02:03:47.453 --> 02:03:48.818
This one looks nasty.

02:03:48.888 --> 02:03:51.755
Yeah, it's just happened just now.
Yeah, if you could.
