00:38.102 --> 00:39.736
Lift-off in 3...

00:39.770 --> 00:40.837
2...

00:40.871 --> 00:41.571
1...

00:41.605 --> 00:42.731
Ignition.

00:47.845 --> 00:48.945
Sir, launch failure!

00:49.013 --> 00:49.846
Launch failure!

00:49.880 --> 00:51.047
Oh, my kids 6 to 12!

00:51.115 --> 00:52.382
Scramble emergency crews!

00:52.449 --> 00:54.651
And someone better get
me answers... and now!

00:54.685 --> 00:55.652
We're trying, sir.

00:55.686 --> 00:57.720
Most of these computers
are just painted on!

00:57.755 --> 00:58.988
Damn budget cuts!

00:59.890 --> 01:00.990
Aah!

01:05.729 --> 01:08.531
The pilots are still inside!

01:14.238 --> 01:15.071
It's no use!

01:15.139 --> 01:18.241
The window and the axe are
made of the same material!

01:18.275 --> 01:19.542
They're done for.

01:20.544 --> 01:22.145
Out of my way!

01:24.982 --> 01:29.619
Let's see how this door
likes 450 horsepower.

01:30.354 --> 01:31.487
Oh, it's a no go!

01:31.522 --> 01:34.057
The cable snapped like
it was made of thread!

01:34.091 --> 01:36.592
Aah! They're burning alive!

01:36.627 --> 01:37.860
Their faces!

01:37.895 --> 01:40.430
Their horrible faces!

01:40.464 --> 01:43.933
Well, it would appear that
there was a missing 1x2 brick

01:43.967 --> 01:46.135
from the space-shuttle assembly kit.

01:46.170 --> 01:49.072
It was believed at the time
that we could finish the vessel

01:49.106 --> 01:51.507
without affecting the
demanding launch schedule.

01:51.575 --> 01:53.676
In hindsight... Aah!
It's all our fault!

01:53.711 --> 01:56.345
We were playing God, and you know it!

01:58.849 --> 02:00.783
Oh!

02:00.818 --> 02:03.853
And then, at the funeral, the
LEGO astronaut's wife meets her

02:03.887 --> 02:06.055
husband's mistress.

02:06.090 --> 02:07.557
Does she have big tits?

02:07.591 --> 02:08.858
May I join you?

02:08.925 --> 02:11.394
Of course, Mr. Bond.

02:11.428 --> 02:12.128
Aah!

02:12.196 --> 02:12.862
Aah!

02:12.930 --> 02:13.496
Ungh!

02:15.065 --> 02:15.698
Awesome!

02:15.766 --> 02:17.233
That was the best movie ever!

02:17.301 --> 02:21.304
I've never...

02:21.371 --> 02:23.940
And top off that happy meal
with a tasty apple pie.

02:23.974 --> 02:25.308
Warning... apple pies are hot.

02:25.375 --> 02:27.944
Do not stick your [bleep] in
the McDonald's apple pie.

02:27.978 --> 02:31.581
What do you call Wilmer
Valderrama's mom?

02:31.648 --> 02:33.750
A fez dispenser!

02:33.784 --> 02:35.318
Oh!

02:35.352 --> 02:36.753
I'll be here all week!

02:36.787 --> 02:39.088
Mommy, those people look like ants.

02:39.123 --> 02:42.859
Oh, that's because we're landing
in the Kingdom of the Ants!

02:42.926 --> 02:43.493
Aaah!

02:43.527 --> 02:44.660
Ah-ha! I got you.

02:44.695 --> 02:45.661
I'm just kidding.

02:45.729 --> 02:47.764
Would you mind keeping it down?

02:47.831 --> 02:49.198
I'm trying to read.

03:01.078 --> 03:03.312
Oh, what the.

03:08.118 --> 03:10.887
Oh, no! No, no, no!

03:10.921 --> 03:15.158
Okay, guys, Andy's almost home
from college for spring break!

03:16.693 --> 03:19.262
Why would they celebrate
a spring breaking?

03:19.296 --> 03:20.963
That's the saddest time for me.

03:20.998 --> 03:22.431
Oh, slink.

03:22.499 --> 03:23.432
Silly canine.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.867
What a freaking jerk.

03:24.902 --> 03:25.868
Andy's here!

03:25.903 --> 03:27.170
All right, ladies!

03:27.204 --> 03:29.138
Single file, front and center!

03:29.173 --> 03:31.407
Commander in chief on the premises!

03:31.441 --> 03:32.575
You mean Obama?

03:32.609 --> 03:34.310
He's not <i>my</i> president.

03:36.413 --> 03:39.048
Tell my story!

03:39.116 --> 03:39.982
Etch!

03:40.050 --> 03:42.952
What's going on up there?

03:44.288 --> 03:45.221
Oh, lord!

03:46.790 --> 03:48.524
You've got to help that girl, sarge.

03:48.592 --> 03:49.158
Oh, God!

03:49.193 --> 03:51.661
She won't stop screaming!

03:51.695 --> 03:54.964
What does "[bleep] my
box dry" even mean?!

03:54.998 --> 03:59.502
This is awesome!

04:00.838 --> 04:02.505
Oh! Oof!

04:02.539 --> 04:03.472
Aw, damn it!

04:03.507 --> 04:06.309
I left my favorite toy
back at the dorm.

04:06.343 --> 04:08.044
His favorite toy?

04:08.078 --> 04:09.846
Time to improvise.

04:09.880 --> 04:10.947
Aah!

04:10.981 --> 04:12.381
What's he doing with Buzz?

04:13.483 --> 04:13.950
Yes!

04:13.984 --> 04:15.284
And ready for a test drive.

04:16.253 --> 04:17.386
He didn't. Not Buzz.

04:19.488 --> 04:23.292
To infinity and beyond!

04:23.327 --> 04:25.394
Domino, mother.

04:26.597 --> 04:27.296
Buzz?

04:27.331 --> 04:28.564
Buzzed by Buzz!

04:28.599 --> 04:29.765
You okay?

04:29.833 --> 04:31.300
Hello, Woody!

04:32.369 --> 04:35.638
Do you know what my daddy did?

04:35.672 --> 04:36.906
Poop!

04:36.940 --> 04:38.207
He pooped!

04:38.275 --> 04:40.209
♪ Boop-de-doop doop boop ♪

04:40.277 --> 04:43.312
Ah, somebody left some
poop in his pants.

04:43.380 --> 04:44.580
It's okay, pal.

04:44.648 --> 04:47.016
We're here for you.

04:47.050 --> 04:51.587
And the farmer, he hauls...
Another load away!

04:51.655 --> 04:54.557
Bye, load! Bye, load!

04:56.360 --> 04:58.761
Good night, sweet prince.

04:58.795 --> 05:00.463
We gonna play tomorrow?

05:00.530 --> 05:03.566
You bet, pal. You bet.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.737
To infinity...

05:14.711 --> 05:16.178
And beyond.

05:18.115 --> 05:20.016
Garfield, we have some bad news.

05:20.050 --> 05:22.184
Oh, someone got a case of the Mondays?

05:22.252 --> 05:23.653
You have type-2 diabetes.

05:23.687 --> 05:24.553
Oh, Garfield!

05:24.588 --> 05:26.555
Your love of lasagna was your undoing.

05:26.623 --> 05:29.992
Actually, his astoundingly
irresponsible owner was his undoing.

05:30.027 --> 05:30.559
Whoa!

05:30.594 --> 05:32.528
Garfield plays by his own rules, Liz.

05:32.562 --> 05:34.430
We need to remove all four feet.

05:34.464 --> 05:35.564
W-what? Hands, too?

05:35.632 --> 05:37.400
You don't have hands, Garfield.

05:37.434 --> 05:38.401
You're not people.

05:38.435 --> 05:41.203
You're a pet with no job or
income who somehow managed to

05:41.238 --> 05:44.206
consume enormous quantities of
Italian cuisine year after year.

05:44.975 --> 05:46.409
How much is this going to cost?

05:46.476 --> 05:47.510
Oh, about $2,200.

05:47.544 --> 05:48.311
Uh, no. No.

05:48.345 --> 05:48.778
Jon?

05:48.845 --> 05:49.946
You did this to him!

05:49.980 --> 05:51.781
That's like a used car, man!

05:51.848 --> 05:54.951
I can't drop that kind of
cash into a 13-year-old cat!

05:55.018 --> 05:55.651
Unh-unh.

05:55.686 --> 05:56.485
No.

05:56.520 --> 05:57.053
No!

05:57.087 --> 05:58.955
Negatory, good buddy.

05:58.989 --> 06:01.123
Not givin' you... No.

06:01.158 --> 06:05.394
What's it gonna be, Garfield two...
dry food or

06:05.462 --> 06:07.496
spaghetti and meatballs?!

06:08.532 --> 06:09.231
Excellent.

06:09.299 --> 06:14.203
I knew you'd make the right choice.

06:14.237 --> 06:15.204
Attention, everyone.

06:15.238 --> 06:18.407
We are now in orbit around the
planet of hot chicks who turn

06:18.442 --> 06:19.775
out to be monsters.

06:19.810 --> 06:23.312
But they're friendly monsters,
and they're very horny.

06:23.347 --> 06:26.449
Unfortunately, they have razor-sharp
teeth in their vaginas.

06:26.483 --> 06:31.554
Although they do have 10 breasts each.

06:31.588 --> 06:33.556
Oh, and the ship is on fire.

06:38.428 --> 06:41.397
Everyone remembers the
heroic heroism that made

06:41.431 --> 06:43.733
captain "Sully" Sullenberger a hero.

06:43.767 --> 06:47.169
But while one hero was born,
another died in the bowels of

06:47.204 --> 06:49.438
the jet engine... Launchpad McQuack.

06:49.473 --> 06:53.175
For not filing an FAA flight
plan, he and 17 seagulls paid

06:53.210 --> 06:54.477
the ultimate price.

06:54.511 --> 06:55.478
All too common.

06:55.512 --> 06:58.914
The decade we called the '90s
introduced characters we thought

06:58.982 --> 07:01.650
we'd never forget, and then we did.

07:01.785 --> 07:03.285
Darkwing Duck remembers.

07:03.320 --> 07:07.089
Launchpad was his sidekick
from 1991 to 1995.

07:07.124 --> 07:08.557
Oh, that idiot!

07:08.692 --> 07:11.560
I lost everything in the flight
1549 class-action lawsuit.

07:11.595 --> 07:14.830
And life, being a cruel bitch,
now my daughter Gosalyn here

07:14.865 --> 07:17.233
needs money for a kidney transplant.

07:17.267 --> 07:19.101
So I've donated my body.

07:19.136 --> 07:20.369
To science?

07:20.404 --> 07:22.671
To this Chinese restaurant.

07:22.706 --> 07:24.740
Let's get dangerous.

07:24.775 --> 07:26.108
Hey, hey, hold on! Wait!

07:26.143 --> 07:26.675
Hold on!

07:26.743 --> 07:28.310
You said this would be humane!

07:28.378 --> 07:29.645
Wait! Wait! Stop! Stop!

07:29.679 --> 07:30.579
What the hell?!

07:30.614 --> 07:32.648
Hey, at least slit my throat first!

07:32.682 --> 07:33.649
Aah! Kill me!

07:33.683 --> 07:35.117
Come on, what the.

07:35.118 --> 07:36.485
Aah! Aaaaaah!!

07:36.520 --> 07:39.922
Live ones cook better.

07:39.923 --> 07:41.223
There's Waldo.

07:41.258 --> 07:44.360
He hid from our eyes, but
never from our hearts.

07:44.394 --> 07:47.463
Later, he became a follower of
the reverend Moonrise Sunbeam

07:47.497 --> 07:50.399
and took up permanent
residence on his compound.

07:50.534 --> 07:52.635
Well, I got tired of always
standing out in the crowd.

07:52.669 --> 07:55.905
From now on, I just want to be
part of something bigger, man.

07:55.939 --> 07:59.008
Brother Waldo, come join
us for some fruit punch.

07:59.042 --> 08:03.112
On August 12, 1998, all of
America played "Where's Waldo"

08:03.146 --> 08:05.214
one last time on CNN.

08:05.282 --> 08:05.915
There he is.

08:05.982 --> 08:08.551
Mesagog planned to send the
earth back to the mesozoic era...

08:08.585 --> 08:11.187
That is, until the Power Rangers
defeated him with

08:11.254 --> 08:12.455
mild gymnastics.

08:12.522 --> 08:14.924
Turning humanity into dinosaurs...
How's that going?

08:14.958 --> 08:17.560
Well, I assume you're being
facetious, since as you can

08:17.627 --> 08:20.262
clearly see, I'm now the
manager of a Wendy's.

08:20.397 --> 08:22.798
I'm trying to treat it
like a minor setback.

08:22.833 --> 08:25.534
The big roadblock was
the dinosaur DNA...

08:25.569 --> 08:27.369
Mr. Mesagog! Mr. Mesagog!

08:27.437 --> 08:30.106
Yo, Triple Stack... Does it go
cheese, bacon, meat, cheese,

08:30.173 --> 08:32.808
bacon, meat, cheese, bacon, meat;
or meat, bacon, cheese,

08:32.842 --> 08:35.510
meat, bacon, cheese, meat, bacon, cheese;
or bacon, bacon,

08:35.544 --> 08:37.446
cheese, bacon, meat,
cheese, meat, meat?

08:37.514 --> 08:40.916
I always forget, yo.

08:40.951 --> 08:44.186
Cheese, bacon, meat, meat, meat,
bacon, cheese, bacon, cheese.

08:44.221 --> 08:47.156
For a different perspective, I
caught up with Pinky and the

08:47.190 --> 08:50.426
Brain, still incarcerated at
ACME labs as test subjects.

08:50.527 --> 08:53.996
Oh, the glory days when
me and Brain was mates.

08:54.064 --> 08:54.897
Narf!

08:54.931 --> 08:57.266
Moved him to a different cage, see?

08:57.300 --> 08:59.068
'Member his big noggin? Zort!

08:59.136 --> 09:01.871
Thought he was smart, but
it was paget's disease.

09:01.905 --> 09:05.074
Side effects include
crippling arthritis.

09:05.108 --> 09:06.242
Oh, and I'm blind.

09:06.276 --> 09:08.811
So, Pinky... What'd you say, friend?

09:08.879 --> 09:11.614
You'll have to speak into
the giant human ear!

09:11.681 --> 09:12.248
Troz!

09:12.315 --> 09:13.682
Ooh!

09:15.051 --> 09:16.418
Remember Daria?

09:16.453 --> 09:17.620
I know. Yuck!

09:17.654 --> 09:20.055
I was anxious to get an
acerbic, dry-witted take on

09:20.123 --> 09:22.691
the tumultuous '90s from this
anti-feminine, basically

09:22.759 --> 09:24.493
asexual, boy-repelling train wreck.

09:24.528 --> 09:26.428
Thanks for sitting
down with us, Daria.

09:26.463 --> 09:27.329
It's Daryl now.

09:27.397 --> 09:30.166
All those years, I thought I was
an exceptionally gross girl,

09:30.200 --> 09:32.668
when, in fact, I was a beautiful man.

09:32.769 --> 09:34.336
I see. How did this happen?

09:34.371 --> 09:37.973
Well, first they enlarged my
clitoris with androgenic hormones.

09:38.008 --> 09:40.976
Then they fashioned my labia
into a makeshift scrotum.

09:43.513 --> 09:45.981
Life's a crazy ride,
especially if you have your

09:46.049 --> 09:46.949
urethra rerouted.

09:48.285 --> 09:51.954
Sad fates for beloved characters
from such a recent era.

09:51.988 --> 09:54.790
Let us forever hold
them in our hearts.

09:54.824 --> 09:56.125
Dinner is served!

09:56.159 --> 09:56.959
Dad?

09:57.027 --> 10:00.129
This...still has a face on it.

10:00.197 --> 10:02.064
E-e-e-e-e-e-e!
