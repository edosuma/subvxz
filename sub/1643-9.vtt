SCOFIELD: Route 66 runs
directly beneath that building.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.728
It's the only building
sitting on top of those tunnels.

00:19.811 --> 00:24.441
All we gotta do is get in there on Pl
and dig ourselves an on-ramp.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.318
- Which one?
- Right there.

00:27.653 --> 00:30.656
This goes down four feet.
It connects to the main line below.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.198
All we've gotta do is widen it,

00:32.281 --> 00:35.244
and we've got ourselves
an on-ramp to Route 66.

00:35.327 --> 00:38.080
I'm gonna find out, you know,
what it is you're doing up there.

00:38.163 --> 00:42.167
You told me that you had been up
in the crawlspace for Pl,

00:43.544 --> 00:45.504
and Pl was never assigned to go there.

now, would you, Scofield?

in your affairs.

there is absolutely nothing I can do.

- Let me find him.

I know where he'd run.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.432

by now, under the circumstances,

you'd understand your position
as a death row inmate.

you can grant an inmate supervised leave.

has low latent inhibition,

28:44.306 --> 28:47.267
it almost always results in mental illness.

28:51.104 --> 28:53.690
it almost always results in creative genius.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.196
Do you think Michael's a genius?

29:00.197 --> 29:04.201
Well, I think that word's been derogated
in the media these days.

29:04.451 --> 29:07.537
But in the classic sense of the word,
yes,ld0.

29:23.470 --> 29:26.139

to Michael.

29:26.223 --> 29:29.685
He became very attuned
to all the suffering around him.

(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

31:27.010 --> 31:28.095
Hello?

31:28.178 --> 31:30.597
LJ, it's Veronica. Where are you?

31:30.680 --> 31:34.142
Oh, Veronica, I don't know.
You gotta come get me.

31:34.434 --> 31:37.229
We can't, okay? We're not in Chicago.
You have to come to us.

31:37.312 --> 31:40.107
All right. Where's that?

31:41.650 --> 31:44.653
Oh. Oh.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.656
<i>LJ: How the hell do they know where I am?
VERONICA: What's going on?</i>

31:47.739 --> 31:49.825
<i>How the hell do they know
where I am? God.</i>

31:49.908 --> 31:52.911
<i>- LJ,</i> I <i>want you to listen to me.
- No, you don't understand.</i>

31:52.994 --> 31:54.496
Everywhere I go, they're there.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.206
I want you to listen to me, okay?

31:56.289 --> 31:59.000
I need you to come to us.
We're in Lake Mercer.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.335
<i>- Where's that'?
- It's a small town.</i>

32:00.419 --> 32:02.129
It's on the Iowa border.
There's a bus station.

32:02.212 --> 32:04.423
<i>I want you to buy a ticket.
We'll meet you there.</i>

32:04.506 --> 32:06.174
They're still alive.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.593
Looks like a bird in the hand
just became three.

32:08.677 --> 32:10.512
<i>- Make sure you keep your cell phone on.
- Let's go.</i>

32:10.595 --> 32:12.180
<i>I need to be able to stay
in contact with you.</i>

32:12.264 --> 32:14.015
- But the kid's right...
- Let's go.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.767
<i>LJ: Okay.
VERONICA: Okay what?</i>

32:16.143 --> 32:18.019
<i>Okay, I'll keep it on.</i>

32:18.854 --> 32:20.522
They're leaving. They're leaving.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.691
LJ, I need to know
that you hear me, okay?

32:22.774 --> 32:25.694
- Lake <i>Mercer.
- Lake Mercer. Okay.</i>

32:26.778 --> 32:28.363
All right, bye.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.896
What the hell are you doing?

33:03.231 --> 33:05.859
Delivering yesterday's news.

33:07.569 --> 33:09.279
(FIORELLO SCREAMING)

33:17.996 --> 33:21.291
Your bus leaves from Depot 6
in just a few minutes.

33:21.583 --> 33:22.792
Thanks.

33:42.562 --> 33:45.607
- Yo, man, get off me, bitch.
- Let's pants him.

33:46.233 --> 33:47.609
(ALL HOOTING)

33:54.157 --> 33:56.034
Wait a minute. I'll be right back.

33:59.955 --> 34:00.956
SARA: I...

34:02.666 --> 34:04.459
just wanted you to know that

34:04.543 --> 34:07.796
if you're looking for someone
to talk to in here, you're not alone.

34:07.879 --> 34:11.967
It's part of my job to counsel inmates
and help them with their problems.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.636
I think I have things
pretty well figured out.

34:16.221 --> 34:19.474
I sort of backed into some information
about you.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.310
I hope you don't mind.

34:22.393 --> 34:25.480
But you have to understand
that there's a reason I became a doctor.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.983
It's in my nature to want to help.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.571
From what I understand,
it's in your nature, too.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.991
You did a lot of good things
before you were in here.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.119
A lot of community work,
a lot of charity work.

34:39.828 --> 34:41.413
What happened?

34:45.958 --> 34:49.963
The man you're talking about died
the moment I stepped inside these walls.

34:51.922 --> 34:53.257
All right.

34:59.556 --> 35:02.058
<i>DISPATCHER: Shuttle now arriving

36:28.895 --> 36:30.689
Watch your step, son.

36:56.506 --> 36:59.092
Hi. Come here.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.474
It's okay.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.228
They're leaving.

37:24.325 --> 37:26.453
You're safe now, all right?

37:46.890 --> 37:48.767
You received communication
from your attorney.

37:48.850 --> 37:50.310
LINCOLN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.770
Please sign this document

37:51.853 --> 37:54.773
certifying that I inspected
the communication for contraband,

37:54.856 --> 37:58.151

(INMATES CHATTERING)

39:04.342 --> 39:05.969
What are you grinning about?

39:06.052 --> 39:10.098
Just the fact that I'm gonna be out
in the real world here in a little bit.

39:10.640 --> 39:13.434
The fact that I'm gonna get me
one final piece of tail

39:13.518 --> 39:15.603
certainly don't hurt either.

39:16.563 --> 39:18.940
Nothing like tail, eh, Scofield?

(SCREAMING)

39:29.951 --> 39:32.620
- Son of a bitch!
- This ends right now.

39:33.121 --> 39:36.499
Oh, you just screwed
some major league pooch, pretty.

39:36.624 --> 39:39.419
I'm gonna sing
like a whole tree-full of birds now.

39:39.502 --> 39:42.505
- Badge!
- You wanna sing, then sing.

39:43.423 --> 39:45.466
But you know what I think?

39:45.842 --> 39:47.802
You don't have the guts.

39:48.636 --> 39:51.514
You want out of here
just as much as the rest of us.

39:53.433 --> 39:55.310
We got a problem here?

40:00.732 --> 40:01.816
No.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.322
I thought we was

40:08.114 --> 40:10.491
missing some tools here. My bad.

40:13.494 --> 40:15.163
Get back to work.

40:17.332 --> 40:18.499
Now,

40:20.084 --> 40:22.211
you and I may be stuck together
in this little dance,

40:22.295 --> 40:24.172
but I call the shots.

40:24.464 --> 40:28.843
First shot, that kid out there,
you don't touch him, ever.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.432
Do we understand each other?

40:46.277 --> 40:47.528
We do.

40:48.488 --> 40:51.699
Out of the way, Julio. Abruzzi!

40:55.787 --> 40:58.706
You and me,
we gotta have a conversation.

41:14.389 --> 41:16.808
LINCOLN: How come he didn't fall through?

41:31.823 --> 41:34.409
- What?
- I warned you.

41:35.284 --> 41:38.579
I'll get it together.
You got to give me more time.

41:39.122 --> 41:41.290
You've had your time, John.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.600
You tripping on something, Alice?

42:12.030 --> 42:14.240
Yeah, that's what I thought.

42:14.949 --> 42:18.453
Lamp it up in here again,
I'll be fitting to break some shop.

- What they doing?
- Fixing the break room.
