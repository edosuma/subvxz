WEBVTT

00:29.020 --> 00:32.729
Are we going to get
something published, or what?

00:33.940 --> 00:36.090
Or do you just want
to cultivate your angst?

00:36.220 --> 00:38.893
- There is a reason why we hesitated
- What do you mean?

00:39.020 --> 00:42.535
- You're the one who stopped.

00:42.660 --> 00:46.539
- Sure, but I can start walking again.

00:47.700 --> 00:51.693
Do I really want to
expose the world to this?

00:51.820 --> 00:53.412
Let's just do it.

00:59.940 --> 01:02.500
<i>This is when it all begins.</i>

01:13.380 --> 01:16.929
<i>Their manuscripts
would have been accepted immediately.</i>

01:17.740 --> 01:20.049
<i>They would've been published the next fall.</i>

01:20.180 --> 01:23.729
<i>Finally they would've been authors.</i>

01:24.260 --> 01:29.254
<i>Their books would have sold poorly.
Erik and Phillip couldn't care less.</i>

01:29.380 --> 01:36.377
<i>More importantly, the books' enigmatic
nature would've made them cult classics</i>

01:37.420 --> 01:40.218
<i>Phillip would've been
overwhelmed by his success.</i>

01:40.340 --> 01:45.653
<i>In a burst of hubris he'd declare
his literary project completed and...</i>

01:46.300 --> 01:52.216
<i>No, it would've been love that caused
Phillip to lose faith in literature.</i>

01:52.620 --> 01:55.578
<i>He would have left Oslo
without telling a soul.</i>

01:56.420 --> 01:59.890
<i>After three months
he would've reached the Vézére-valley.</i>

02:00.220 --> 02:04.930
<i>The sight of the Lascaux paintings
would've provoked a delirious fit.</i>

02:05.060 --> 02:07.449
<i>Believing he knew Japanese, -</i>

02:07.580 --> 02:10.458
<i>- he'd follow a tourist group
from Hiroshima an entire day, -</i>

02:10.580 --> 02:14.619
<i>- before collapsing.
Diagnosis: Acute Stendhal Syndrome.</i>

02:14.740 --> 02:17.538
<i>The urge to write
would again have resurfaced.</i>

02:18.860 --> 02:20.737
January. Oslo.

02:20.900 --> 02:23.778
<i>The loss of Phillip
would've become a loss of inspiration.</i>

02:24.340 --> 02:26.012
<i>The writer's block was a fact.</i>

02:26.900 --> 02:33.453
<i>Author Sten Egil Dahl would have
convinced Erik to go abroad to write.</i>

02:37.420 --> 02:41.459
<i>She was a French publisher's daughter.
Her father had idealized her, -</i>

02:41.580 --> 02:46.415
<i>- causing a deep inferiority complex,
both physical and intellectual.</i>

02:46.540 --> 02:51.375
<i>On October 24 she would have
thrown herself from their balcony.</i>

02:51.500 --> 02:55.334
<i>Her letter would've suggested it was
their happiness she couldn't deal with.</i>

02:55.460 --> 02:59.533
<i>Erik would've felt ashamed by the
creativity triggered by her death.</i>

03:04.300 --> 03:07.258
<i>They would have met
by chance at a café...</i>

03:07.380 --> 03:10.417
<i>No, on the street.</i>

03:10.500 --> 03:12.775
<i>On the Metro...
...at an airport...</i>

03:13.220 --> 03:16.212
<i>No, in the Luxembourg Garden.</i>

03:20.660 --> 03:25.131
<i>They would have realized
they were both writing the same book.</i>

03:27.420 --> 03:31.777
<i>The book would've triggered a revolution
in East Africa, -</i>

03:31.900 --> 03:34.972
<i>- been banned by the Vatican</i>,
<i>disillusioned the Dalai Lama, -</i>

03:35.100 --> 03:38.058
<i>- and shaped the sexuality of Frode -</i>

03:38.180 --> 03:39.852
<i>- a 12 year old son of a pastry chef -</i>

03:39.980 --> 03:42.938
<i>- who would've happened to read...</i>

03:50.660 --> 03:53.572
This is when it all begins.

04:18.620 --> 04:21.293
We have to get out of this country.

05:59.060 --> 06:04.088
<i>Erik was relieved when his
suspicions were finally confirmed.</i>

06:05.180 --> 06:07.375
<i>He was utterly without talent.</i>

06:07.780 --> 06:11.739
<i>Phillip's manuscript was accepted.
His book was released in the fall.</i>

06:14.580 --> 06:15.854
Hi.

06:55.620 --> 06:59.056
SIX MONTHS LATER

07:09.900 --> 07:13.336
These are great CDs.
Chris De Burgh, Sissel...

07:13.460 --> 07:17.135
- Pan Pipe Moods?
- Those are dad's old CDs.

07:21.620 --> 07:25.454
- They came with the car.
- Came with the car?

07:25.580 --> 07:29.892
Air condition and Pan Pipe Moods
is standard equipment in a Volvo?

07:58.340 --> 07:59.819
Hi.

08:04.100 --> 08:08.252
- Is that everything?
- I think so.

08:08.380 --> 08:11.656
Thanks.

08:31.620 --> 08:35.578
It'll be nice to come home
to your apartment, your PC...

08:36.419 --> 08:37.852
Maybe you can start writing again.

08:49.700 --> 08:52.578
- Do you have any music we can play?
- Eh... No.

09:00.380 --> 09:04.089
Did you get hold of
any good drugs, Phillip?

09:04.220 --> 09:08.930
I actually talked to a doctor who...

09:09.020 --> 09:13.059
They said
down at the hospital that...

09:16.100 --> 09:18.853
That more people
get addicted to...

09:18.980 --> 09:22.609
I'm sorry,
but right now you sound like Geir.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.613
Shit...

09:28.420 --> 09:30.012
Nice friends.

09:30.700 --> 09:31.700
Geir.

10:51.220 --> 10:53.893
Could we drop by Bygdoy?

10:54.140 --> 10:57.018
Isn't it a little too cold for that?

12:12.540 --> 12:17.409
<i>The punk band</i> Kommune <i>played their</i>
<i>farewell concert on Dec. 27, 1999.</i>

12:17.540 --> 12:20.850
Next song:
"Fingerfucked by the Prime Minister".

12:21.140 --> 12:27.056
<i>Morten, a diehard fan, missed
his train and had to bike 50 km.</i>

12:33.700 --> 12:35.691
<i>After 12 minutes,
he got a knee in his eye.</i>

12:35.820 --> 12:38.380
<i>His first encounter
with Phillip and the others.</i>

12:53.300 --> 12:56.610
<i>Ironic punk quickly evolved
into cynical commercialism:</i>

12:56.740 --> 12:59.049
<i>Henning started an ad agency.</i>

12:59.460 --> 13:02.532
This is... Katinka.

13:02.860 --> 13:06.614
<i>Morten quit college to work for
Henning as a "creative" consultant.</i>

13:06.780 --> 13:10.056
She's discussing ads in public spaces.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.136
I'm just trying to get her to bed.

13:14.700 --> 13:15.700
Hi, Lillian.

13:16.140 --> 13:19.416
<i>Erik kept his girlfriend
at a safe distance from his friends.</i>

13:19.540 --> 13:22.452
Tonight? I don't know.

13:22.580 --> 13:25.436
<i>Morten asked Geir what she was like. -</i>

13:25.460 --> 13:28.099
<i>Geir said she was "Intelligent".</i>

13:28.220 --> 13:33.533
<i>Morten therefore assumed she was
ugly. Geir pretended to agree.</i>

13:34.260 --> 13:40.017
<i>A drunk Geir had once told Erik
he feared they were friends with him -</i>

13:40.140 --> 13:42.131
<i>- just because his brother
was in the band.</i>

13:42.260 --> 13:46.651
<i>Erik then had to wait two days
before asking him for free tickets.</i>

14:18.460 --> 14:21.338
- What does that mean?

14:21.460 --> 14:22.893
"Que le tout"?

14:23.020 --> 14:25.898
Phillip, please turn
it down a little.

14:25.980 --> 14:28.972
Violins are nice. but...

14:29.300 --> 14:32.337
"The only thing left,
is everything."

14:32.460 --> 14:35.338
"The whole."

15:05.700 --> 15:08.214
- Hi, Phillip!
- Hi, mom.

15:14.060 --> 15:15.413
Hi.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.458
- How is it going?
- Fine, I think.

15:22.020 --> 15:23.658
- Was the drive OK?
- Yes.

15:24.260 --> 15:28.617
- Not too much traffic?
- No, we stopped at Bygdoy.

15:28.740 --> 15:30.458
Have you removed my things?

15:32.300 --> 15:35.770
Well, I had to tidy up a bit.

15:37.700 --> 15:40.772
- Where are the pictures of Kari?
- We talked about this.

15:40.900 --> 15:45.371
- You just took them down?
- It's for your own good.

15:45.500 --> 15:50.620
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Maybe I forgot. The doctor...

15:50.740 --> 15:52.298
Give me my keys, mom.

15:53.460 --> 15:55.894
It's only practical
that someone has a spare set.

15:57.820 --> 15:58.820
Hey...

16:02.620 --> 16:04.611
Maybe you should take the keys.

16:09.420 --> 16:15.177
Think about it. You'll probably
write something incredible now.

16:17.780 --> 16:21.375
- How's your writing going?
- To hell.

16:21.500 --> 16:25.334
I've reworked
that last one I sent in.

16:25.780 --> 16:28.692
Think you could take a look at it?

16:29.780 --> 16:33.250
You should just send it in.
I'm sure it's excellent.

16:38.740 --> 16:40.298
Should we head home?

16:41.780 --> 16:43.691
Am I tired already?

17:26.020 --> 17:30.969
Sales is about desire,
commitment, knowledge...

17:31.100 --> 17:34.888
Good. Fhaisal,
but you forget one key point:

17:35.020 --> 17:40.094
You can't sell over the phone, until
you have learned to sell yourself.

17:41.340 --> 17:45.652
You should leave modesty at the door
before entering here.

17:46.300 --> 17:49.212
Oops! Modesty just
got run over by a steamroller.

17:50.380 --> 17:52.655
Toss the ball to someone, Fhaisal.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.058
OK, who are you?

17:57.180 --> 18:00.058
- Kari.
- Who are you?

18:02.500 --> 18:03.774
Kari.

18:03.900 --> 18:06.050
<i>Kari grew up on the east side of town -</i>

18:06.180 --> 18:08.330
<i>- Phillip on the west.</i>

18:09.100 --> 18:13.252
<i>Still Phillip insisted he had seen
her before: Independence Day 1989 -</i>

18:13.380 --> 18:16.895
<i>- he had gotten lost and ended
up marching with the wrong school.</i>

18:17.380 --> 18:20.417
<i>Kari didn't believe him,
but liked the idea.</i>

18:21.700 --> 18:25.739
<i>At 18 Kari met Rune,
the former guitarist in "Kommune", -</i>

18:27.140 --> 18:30.132
<i>- now frontman in "Mondo Topless", -</i>

18:30.260 --> 18:34.856
<i>- incidentally the worst use of a Russ
Meyer film title as a band name ever.</i>

18:35.500 --> 18:36.853
<i>Fucking hippies!</i>

18:43.140 --> 18:49.534
<i>After dating Rune for three years,
Kari started noticing Phillip.</i>

18:50.140 --> 18:53.769
<i>She thought he was cute,
but was sure he was gay.</i>

18:54.900 --> 18:56.697
<i>She asked Rune who they were.</i>

18:56.820 --> 19:00.813
Just some spoiled rich kids
from the West Side.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.817
I heard one of them
wrote this weird book.

19:18.460 --> 19:22.931
<i>Phillip later told Kari he knew
they were destined for each other.</i>

19:24.580 --> 19:27.014
<i>In ten seconds
she will look at him.</i>

19:27.140 --> 19:28.500
Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five,

19:32.500 --> 19:33.500
four.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.540
Three.

19:34.660 --> 19:35.775
Two.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.374
One...

20:04.300 --> 20:07.337
<i>The next day
he invited her to Paris.</i>

20:10.740 --> 20:14.176
<i>Phillip's sarcastic humor
made her gasp with laughter.</i>

20:14.300 --> 20:16.860
<i>Phillip said
her gasping was repulsive.</i>

20:17.660 --> 20:22.654
<i>This only made her gasp even more.
His gaze made her feel pretty.</i>

20:30.460 --> 20:34.248
<i>Phillip loved her parodies
of "sexy" girls in music videos.</i>

20:34.380 --> 20:38.658
<i>She was the only girl he had met who
had Ramones "Road to Ruin" on vinyl.</i>

20:39.700 --> 20:42.772
<i>He enjoyed that they both
admitted actually disliking the Clash.</i>

21:05.020 --> 21:06.214
Are you OK?

21:09.900 --> 21:11.219
I'm fine.

21:33.780 --> 21:37.489
- Hi.
- It's amazing.

21:37.620 --> 21:40.418
This is incredible.

21:40.540 --> 21:43.418
In the subway...
I didn't see the sign...

21:43.540 --> 21:47.169
I sat down, and he said I...
shouldn't... It was painted...

21:47.300 --> 21:50.417
But there wasn't any paint...

21:53.060 --> 21:57.451
You have paint on your jacket.
There's paint all over your back.

21:59.340 --> 22:01.217
No, there isn't.

22:09.100 --> 22:12.490
- There was something... Fuck.
- Phillip, what's wrong?

22:16.940 --> 22:19.170
It's just... I... I...

22:26.460 --> 22:28.735
It wasn't by chance.

22:34.660 --> 22:36.696
It was no coincidence that we met.

22:43.980 --> 22:48.337
<i>The doctors said his obsessive romance
with Kari had triggered his psychosis.</i>

22:52.100 --> 22:55.809
<i>When Phillip was committed,
Kari was advised not to visit him.</i>

23:22.460 --> 23:24.018
Hi.

23:25.380 --> 23:26.820
I let myself in.
Where have you been?

23:28.540 --> 23:31.771
- I kept trying the doorbell.
- I just went to the store.

23:32.380 --> 23:36.293
- I'm fine. Don't worry.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.650
I just wanted to show you this.

23:47.300 --> 23:51.452
They accepted it. They're
going to publish "Prosopopeia."

23:52.980 --> 23:54.777
That's great!

23:55.460 --> 23:58.930
- Have you told Lillian yet?
- No.

23:59.900 --> 24:01.618
A good book cover is important.

24:04.220 --> 24:08.611
Didn't you say that if
your book was accepted, you would...

24:08.740 --> 24:10.458
What do you mean?

24:17.220 --> 24:20.132
- I have to break up with Lillian.
- You don't have to.

24:20.900 --> 24:23.050
Yes, I do.

24:25.900 --> 24:28.334
We've been going out for three years.

24:28.460 --> 24:31.338
I can't waste any more time.

24:32.580 --> 24:35.094
We can't have girlfriends now.

24:35.220 --> 24:38.098
We're supposed to write and read...

24:38.220 --> 24:40.176
- and hang out with friends.

24:40.340 --> 24:42.092
And if we feel the urge, -

24:42.860 --> 24:46.375
- we'll practice deviant,
fetishistic sex with prostitutes.

24:50.620 --> 24:54.056
You can practice deviant
fetishistic sex with Lillian.

24:56.860 --> 24:58.373
That...

25:03.700 --> 25:05.179
No.

25:06.660 --> 25:08.730
I have to break up with her.

25:14.980 --> 25:17.255
I can't stay with her
just to be nice.

25:18.700 --> 25:24.138
Not that she's terrible to be with.
She's actually pretty cool.

25:24.260 --> 25:28.856
Girls aren't cool. They can be
pretty or "cute" and -

25:28.980 --> 25:31.733
- with some serious dieting, even sexy.

25:31.860 --> 25:36.775
They can be nice. Dumb, but nice
But who wants "nice"?

25:36.900 --> 25:40.813
You want interesting people around you.

25:41.900 --> 25:44.937
Has a girl ever introduced you to
any new music -

25:45.060 --> 25:49.975
- or recommended a book you
didn't already read in high school?

25:50.100 --> 25:52.330
Anything just slightly
outside the mainstream?

25:54.060 --> 25:58.133
If so, she got it from an ex,
her brother, her father.

25:58.260 --> 26:00.899
They just pretend.

26:01.540 --> 26:06.898
It's worse here. On the East Side
they know they're underprivileged.

26:08.580 --> 26:12.459
Here they think they
have to have an opinion.

26:12.780 --> 26:16.534
And intrude on adult conversations.

26:20.300 --> 26:22.689
- Hi.
- Hi, Lillian, it's me.

26:25.540 --> 26:29.249
Guys in long-term relationships
become so lame.

26:30.100 --> 26:35.572
They get sucked into this feminine
sphere of TV-series and nice dinners.

26:35.900 --> 26:39.415
They get less and less time
to read and listen to music.

26:39.540 --> 26:41.576
Eventually they don't even miss it.

26:43.420 --> 26:46.969
They end up as
understimulated, bourgeois retards.

26:52.860 --> 26:53.860
Hi!

26:57.300 --> 27:01.612
<i>If he broke up now, Lillian would
think it's because of the novel.</i>

27:01.740 --> 27:06.211
<i>He'd be a phoney
who dumps girls once he succeeds.</i>

27:06.340 --> 27:12.495
<i>She'd think she wasn't good enough
for him. Which wasn't entirely true.</i>

27:12.620 --> 27:18.536
<i>And what about all his things? It
would seem cynical to take them now.</i>

27:18.660 --> 27:22.016
<i>But picking them up later
would definitely be wrong...</i>

27:23.220 --> 27:25.131
What's the matter?

27:27.100 --> 27:28.499
Erik, come here a second.

27:29.500 --> 27:33.732
I don't mind you using my PC at all.

27:33.860 --> 27:37.933
But I don't appreciate that -

27:38.020 --> 27:40.614
- things like this pop up,
when I turn it on.

27:42.660 --> 27:47.654
Is this what you look at?
Feel free to talk to me about it.

27:50.900 --> 27:54.097
But what if that girl was me?

27:54.620 --> 27:57.851
<i>What if she can't take it?
That may be conceited of him, but...</i>

27:58.380 --> 28:00.098
Bullshit.

28:00.300 --> 28:02.256
Feeling guilty is slave mentality.

28:02.380 --> 28:05.975
Sometimes you have to
be Zarathustra. Be mean.

28:06.140 --> 28:07.937
I have to tell you...

28:08.940 --> 28:12.376
<i>Suddenly Erik remembered
the last time he was mean.</i>

28:12.500 --> 28:15.060
<i>Erik and Phillip were in 2nd grade.</i>

28:15.700 --> 28:18.737
<i>Phillip had another best friend:</i>

28:19.340 --> 28:22.616
<i>Erik heard Svein talk
about Phillip to a 6th grader.</i>

28:22.860 --> 28:27.058
You two hang out a lot.
Are you gay, or what?

28:27.180 --> 28:30.172
No, but maybe he is.

28:30.300 --> 28:34.532
<i>Having had a liberal upbringing, Erik
had always defended society's outcasts.</i>

28:34.660 --> 28:38.175
<i>But this time he told everybody
that Svein said Phillip was gay.</i>

28:38.500 --> 28:42.698
<i>Erik's mother heard this from
a classmate and Erik's teacher.</i>

28:43.820 --> 28:46.653
He used "gay" as a term of abuse?

28:47.140 --> 28:48.812
His father is reactionary, but...

28:48.940 --> 28:52.250
<i>An emergency meeting was called.</i>

28:52.940 --> 28:56.250
<i>Svein left the school shortly after.</i>

28:56.380 --> 28:58.610
<i>Years later Svein was seen -</i>

28:58.740 --> 29:02.050
<i>- cutting in line at a liquor store</i>,
<i>pushing a baby carriage.</i>

29:03.820 --> 29:08.132
- My novel was accepted.
- That's great!

30:54.380 --> 30:56.610
Are you still at the university?

30:59.180 --> 31:02.331
I don't know.
It's kind of complicated.

31:03.700 --> 31:06.339
I've considered
studying sociology again.

31:07.540 --> 31:10.054
No... I don't know.

31:10.180 --> 31:12.899
I'm working at the moment.

31:14.260 --> 31:15.613
Hi.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.570
I'm going to get a coffee.

31:38.900 --> 31:40.811
How long has it been?

31:42.660 --> 31:44.935
Seven months.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.571
I can't believe
we're sitting here like this.

32:07.380 --> 32:08.654
Yes...

32:16.980 --> 32:21.770
Remember when I tricked you
into falling in love, in Paris?

32:21.900 --> 32:25.575
- I was already in love with you.
- No, you weren't.

32:25.700 --> 32:27.850
No, you weren't.

32:27.980 --> 32:33.373
You were still into
that "rock star", weren't you?

32:36.860 --> 32:38.816
Poor Rune.

32:39.780 --> 32:41.213
No.

32:42.020 --> 32:44.996
But we had a nice time, didn't we.

32:45.020 --> 32:47.978
In Paris.

32:52.220 --> 32:56.213
Were you in love with me then?

32:56.340 --> 32:59.935
Yes. I was.

33:00.420 --> 33:02.615
I wasn't sick already then.

33:05.380 --> 33:06.972
I wasn't.

33:21.500 --> 33:25.971
- You've put your hair up.
- Yes.

33:28.100 --> 33:31.410
- I like it.
- No, you don't

33:31.980 --> 33:35.529
I do. It's just different.

33:36.900 --> 33:38.538
You look nice.

33:51.900 --> 33:55.051
I felt a lot worse afterwards.

33:55.420 --> 33:57.888
I didn't understand anything.

33:59.780 --> 34:01.657
I wanted to call.

34:04.220 --> 34:07.132
But they told me
that wasn't a good idea.

34:07.940 --> 34:10.215
And then I didn't know...

34:12.380 --> 34:16.817
- I didn't know how you felt.
- That must have been hard.

34:21.020 --> 34:23.454
I wish we could just...

34:25.219 --> 34:27.574
Meet all over again.

34:29.860 --> 34:31.418
Forget everything.

34:37.940 --> 34:39.578
Bye.

34:51.420 --> 34:54.331
I must admit.
After reading this I thought:

34:54.820 --> 35:00.577
"He must be some eccentric,
old-before-his-time type".

35:00.700 --> 35:02.531
No offense.

35:04.780 --> 35:09.137
And then you show up.
Look at him!

35:09.260 --> 35:12.855
I mean, he's handsome.
A good-looking boy.

35:17.700 --> 35:21.693
- So what happens now?
- Certain parts will be reworked.

35:22.260 --> 35:25.491
And it needs to be proofread.

35:25.620 --> 35:28.498
But this is a book
It will be published this fall.

35:29.100 --> 35:33.412
This fall?

35:33.540 --> 35:35.258
Isn't that a little soon?

35:35.380 --> 35:38.929
- I just feel...
- Leave the feeling to me.

35:42.340 --> 35:47.050
- But the title: "Prosopopeia"
- We've discussed that.

35:47.180 --> 35:50.855
I like one-word titles myself:
"Hunger", "Underworld"...

35:50.980 --> 35:54.893
- "Prosopopeia" is one word.
- He's right about that.

36:01.340 --> 36:07.529
Your first book sets the tone
for your entire authorship.

36:08.300 --> 36:14.694
Imagine a critic writing
a review of "Prozac-and-pee".

36:15.140 --> 36:19.133
- I'm provoking you a little, but...
- I love the title.

36:22.420 --> 36:26.732
There's something about
your thematic structure that...

36:27.740 --> 36:30.698
It's interesting that you
know Phillip Reisnes.

36:30.820 --> 36:36.258
Something about your book
reminded me of his.

36:36.780 --> 36:40.819
Maybe you're right. Thank you.

36:41.860 --> 36:43.578
You and Reisnes...

36:48.140 --> 36:50.290
How old are you? 23?

36:50.420 --> 36:53.696
Fantastic!

36:57.260 --> 37:02.493
A word to the wise:
Never listen to old farts like me.

37:02.820 --> 37:07.052
No, no, no.
Remember what Wittgenstein says:

37:07.180 --> 37:12.812
The important things in life are
expressed through music, not words.

37:14.580 --> 37:17.538
I have something I need to do.

37:19.340 --> 37:20.932
Excellent.

37:21.700 --> 37:26.774
Have you read Ottar Tomte? We're marking
the release of his posthumous poetry.

37:27.900 --> 37:32.212
- If you want to go.
- Sure. Thanks for the invitation.

37:32.900 --> 37:36.256
- So?
- Who was friends with Ottar Tomte?

37:36.380 --> 37:41.693
Who wrote the epilogue for his book
and will feel obliged to appear?

37:50.140 --> 37:56.659
<i>Erik and Phillip discovered
Sten Egil Dahl when they were 17.</i>

37:56.780 --> 38:00.853
<i>They both spent all their lunch money
on books and records.</i>

38:03.580 --> 38:07.619
<i>Sten Egil Dahl
wrote his first novel at age 20.</i>

38:07.740 --> 38:12.939
<i>It was awarded the Nordic
Council's Prize for Literature in 1964.</i>

38:14.540 --> 38:17.737
<i>Unexpectedly, he didn't
show up at the awards ceremony.</i>

38:19.140 --> 38:23.258
<i>This reinforced his reputation as
solitary and detached from reality.</i>

38:23.580 --> 38:31.373
China considers it beautiful that
the North Vietnamese are bleeding!

38:31.500 --> 38:35.209
My book has nothing to do
with Chinese politics!

38:35.340 --> 38:37.934
I'm afraid the debate has to end here.

38:38.060 --> 38:39.573
Thank you.

38:43.540 --> 38:46.976
<i>Sten Egil Dahl moved to Paris,
where he wrote his second novel.</i>

38:47.740 --> 38:50.971
<i>He soon withdrew from public life.</i>

38:51.260 --> 38:53.649
<i>Before returning to Norway,
he only had contact -</i>

38:53.780 --> 38:56.931
<i>- with reclusive author
Maurice Blanchot.</i>

39:00.140 --> 39:02.893
<i>Little is known
about Dahl after this.</i>

39:03.020 --> 39:06.410
<i>He published a few books</i>,
<i>but remained a recluse.</i>

39:06.540 --> 39:09.930
<i>He lived isolated in a house
by the Frogner Park.</i>

39:10.300 --> 39:12.973
<i>Erik found a cryptic passage
in "Crystal" -</i>

39:13.100 --> 39:16.410
<i>- where the Monolith statue,
observed from a window -</i>

39:16.540 --> 39:18.815
<i>- was described as a sundial.</i>

39:19.740 --> 39:21.890
- That must be the house.
- Yes.

39:22.500 --> 39:27.494
<i>Phillip's first work was called
"Dust". Erik was impressed.</i>

39:28.860 --> 39:34.935
<i>Erik's story took three months.
He claimed he wrote it in one night.</i>

40:15.540 --> 40:17.735
It works better
if you remove the lens cap.

40:22.340 --> 40:26.049
Listen, "Rain Man", have you been
out of the apartment yet?

40:26.180 --> 40:29.490
- I went to the pharmacy yesterday.
- The pharmacy?

40:30.820 --> 40:33.778
- So you'll go?
- I guess.

40:36.220 --> 40:40.930
And dad says, "Henning, give Geir
more space around the dinner table."

40:41.060 --> 40:46.214
I thought, "Is he planning on
getting fatter?" He was a chubby kid.

40:46.740 --> 40:49.777
- No, I wasn't.
- You were our own Michelin Man.

40:52.100 --> 40:54.136
- How much do you weigh now?
- 75.

40:54.260 --> 40:55.818
Erik?

41:02.060 --> 41:04.449
Johanne, from the publisher's.

41:04.580 --> 41:07.697
Of course!
Good to see you again.

41:13.260 --> 41:15.933
Feel free to join us.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.294
Thanks.

41:21.700 --> 41:27.570
- Johanne works with my publisher.
- Well I'm also working on my MA.

41:27.700 --> 41:31.329
I was a big fan
of Erik's manuscript.

41:46.820 --> 41:49.288
What is your master's thesis about?

41:52.420 --> 41:56.857
I'll probably change it a bit.

41:56.980 --> 42:03.453
But it's basically about contemporary
literature. The new Norwegian authors.

42:07.060 --> 42:11.053
Anyway, things are more exciting
for you, with your upcoming release.

42:14.340 --> 42:16.171
You're Phillip, right?

42:16.820 --> 42:21.450
"Phantom Images" is
one of my favourite books ever.

42:23.220 --> 42:27.532
Particularly that long passage
toward the end.

42:27.940 --> 42:29.419
Is that how you work now?

42:31.340 --> 42:34.013
Phillip has been
a little tired lately.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.934
But he's better now. Right?

42:38.380 --> 42:40.894
Soon you'll write
something awesome again.

42:50.740 --> 42:54.130
- We had a meeting today.
- Sebastian. Hi.

42:54.940 --> 42:56.851
A new cell phone ad campaign.

42:57.260 --> 43:00.889
I like the edge.
It's quirky, it's weird. It works.

43:01.020 --> 43:06.174
We made small talk, wondered if
we had any mutual acquaintances.

43:06.820 --> 43:09.015
It turns out we did.

43:09.140 --> 43:13.019
- Lars Henriksen?
- No. Lars Etterstad.

43:13.740 --> 43:15.412
- Did he go to Berg High School?
- Yes.

43:16.780 --> 43:20.136
Porno Lars? They know Porno!

43:20.260 --> 43:23.491
You guys know Porno Lars?

43:23.620 --> 43:28.569
This consultant had lived
in that flat share with Lars.

43:29.140 --> 43:32.018
Lars came home late one night.

43:32.940 --> 43:37.650
He asked if Lars wanted a glass
of wine. But Lars answered:

43:37.780 --> 43:40.169
I'm trying to cut back on TV.

43:40.300 --> 43:44.339
He said he was going to read
his new Heidegger book.

43:45.980 --> 43:47.698
But thanks for the offer.

43:49.220 --> 43:54.340
Look at him. He has no idea
that he goes by the name of Porno Lars.

44:05.820 --> 44:09.256
Careful, Lars. Too much Heidegger
can make you dizzy.

44:11.660 --> 44:15.369
What's he saying?
I can't understand his dialect.

44:17.660 --> 44:20.891
What's that tattoo? An ad?

44:21.060 --> 44:24.052
"Oslo City Shopping Centre"?

44:24.180 --> 44:27.252
- No, don't! I'm dry!
- Oh really?

44:43.780 --> 44:45.498
So you're getting your master's?

44:54.980 --> 44:56.379
Are you OK?

44:56.780 --> 44:59.453
Sure. I just don't understand
your friends' humor.

45:05.100 --> 45:08.888
What's Mathis Wergeland's
book called, Erik?

45:10.020 --> 45:12.978
"That Which Ties Us Down."
- Right.

45:13.420 --> 45:16.890
That which Ties Us Down.
"Ties"...

45:17.020 --> 45:20.615
- I liked Mathis' book.
- I figured.

45:20.740 --> 45:26.531
If he had written in English,
he would be world famous by now.

45:26.660 --> 45:30.096
- You're just jealous.
- Jealous? Me?

45:30.220 --> 45:34.179
I knew him before he was famous
and he was a jerk even then.

45:34.300 --> 45:38.532
Oh "jerk" was he. Well, not everyone
can become a famous author.

45:39.420 --> 45:44.255
You do have a point. "Jerk" isn't
precise enough to describe him.

45:45.380 --> 45:47.450
I wish Mathis would -

45:48.780 --> 45:52.978
- choke on black cock in hell, that
politically correct fascist cunt.

45:53.100 --> 45:54.169
No...

46:01.740 --> 46:03.253
That's enough!

46:03.500 --> 46:05.730
- He's just kidding.
- No I'm not.

46:05.940 --> 46:09.296
I don't care, I've had it.
I hate people like him.

46:09.620 --> 46:15.138
What you hate is war and George Bush
and the World Bank and such.

46:15.700 --> 46:17.656
Who the hell do you think you are?

46:19.380 --> 46:24.579
You are the most immature
people I have ever met!

46:24.700 --> 46:30.570
Spreading nasty rumours about
each other... I feel sorry for you.

46:30.700 --> 46:34.693
- And for him.
- Me? What are you talking about?

46:35.660 --> 46:38.493
Why do you hang out with these people?

46:39.500 --> 46:40.979
Sorry for me?

46:41.100 --> 46:43.460
- What's she talking about?
- I've met guys like you before.

46:44.980 --> 46:48.575
I just have one thing to say:

46:48.700 --> 46:55.173
It can't be easy to
have problems in this crowd.

46:56.420 --> 46:58.376
You're so cute when you're mad.

46:59.020 --> 47:00.851
And you are incredibly banal!

47:05.580 --> 47:07.969
She seemed nice.

47:08.100 --> 47:11.536
Bye.

47:49.500 --> 47:50.853
Hi.

47:50.980 --> 47:53.574
- Hi, Erik!
- Hi.

47:54.980 --> 47:58.768
- Long time no see.
- Isn't Lillian here?

47:59.260 --> 48:00.295
No.

48:06.180 --> 48:07.693
Does anyone want a drink?

48:09.660 --> 48:12.413
- I think I'll wait.
- No, thanks.

48:17.900 --> 48:21.256
- Have you seen Sten Egil Dahl?
- I doubt he'll show.

48:21.980 --> 48:27.213
- But you and...?
- I just wanted her to come.

48:29.380 --> 48:31.450
Are you sure that's a good idea?

48:34.740 --> 48:36.856
What does your psychiatrist say?

48:41.020 --> 48:44.490
Is it a problem that Kari is here?

48:44.620 --> 48:47.817
- I didn't mean it like that.

48:56.220 --> 49:00.691
- How are you doing?
- Fine. So-so, I guess.

49:02.100 --> 49:05.217
- Are you still at the university?
- No, I don't know

49:06.860 --> 49:09.852
- I'm in telemarketing.
- How interesting.

49:09.980 --> 49:14.735
No. It isn't.
Actually, it sucks.

49:15.500 --> 49:17.331
I heard your book
is getting published.

49:18.340 --> 49:22.458
Yes.
I'm pretty nervous about that.

49:26.860 --> 49:28.771
There's Mathis Wergeland.

49:30.580 --> 49:33.890
Please don't come over,
you superficial imbecile.

49:34.780 --> 49:35.780
Shit.

49:36.980 --> 49:39.494
Look at this! Phillip Reisnes.

49:39.620 --> 49:42.453
Long time no see.
Good to have you back.

49:42.580 --> 49:44.457
Are you writing?

49:45.540 --> 49:48.657
No, I'm... that is...

49:52.420 --> 49:56.095
Hi. Erik. Erik Hoiaas

49:56.220 --> 49:59.496
This is Kari... Kari...

49:59.620 --> 50:02.930
Kari-Kari? Nice to meet you.

50:03.740 --> 50:05.651
I really believe in this guy.

50:10.740 --> 50:13.334
See you around, all right?

50:15.900 --> 50:18.653
I... I don't think...

50:20.900 --> 50:23.892
I have to go.

50:24.060 --> 50:26.620
Don't let him bother you.

50:26.740 --> 50:29.459
I just don't feel well.

50:30.420 --> 50:33.253
- I'm tired.
- What about Sten Egil Dahl?

50:33.380 --> 50:35.416
Do you want to go home?

50:37.500 --> 50:39.058
I can't do this. Sorry.

50:55.860 --> 50:59.091
- This was a mistake.
- Don't worry about it.

51:01.780 --> 51:04.340
It just isn't like it used to be.

51:07.540 --> 51:12.489
I know it's important to Erik,
but I don't want to write anymore.

51:53.980 --> 51:55.015
Having fun?

51:56.820 --> 52:00.813
- Yes.
- Have you thought about your title?

52:00.940 --> 52:04.057
- Yes, I've thought about it.
- Excellent.

52:05.220 --> 52:09.179
I think "Prosopopeia"
is a good title.

52:09.300 --> 52:10.938
Don't you?

52:12.900 --> 52:16.449
Don't ask me, tell me.

52:16.580 --> 52:21.096
Say: The book's title is
"Prosopopeia", dammit!

52:21.220 --> 52:26.010
I'll remember that. Thanks.
We'll talk later.

52:28.220 --> 52:30.131
Sten Egil Dahl?

52:41.700 --> 52:47.297
My name is Erik Hoiaas.
I'm a big fan of your work.

52:47.420 --> 52:51.174
- It's a great honour for me...
- Hey, Erik! Hi.

52:51.300 --> 52:55.851
Mathis Wergeland.
I'm a big fan of yours.

52:55.980 --> 53:00.212
Well "fan" is a little teenage,
but "admirer" is so formal.

53:01.060 --> 53:02.971
"Crystal" is just amazing.

53:03.140 --> 53:05.973
Your opening chapter there...

53:06.100 --> 53:09.490
There's this...

53:09.620 --> 53:11.975
This...

53:12.100 --> 53:15.490
- Don't you agree?
- Absolutely.

53:15.620 --> 53:19.408
- Do you write as well?
- Yes, I have written a book.

53:20.380 --> 53:22.416
You probably haven't read it.

53:23.500 --> 53:25.889
It hasn't been published yet.

53:26.020 --> 53:30.969
- Then I probably haven't read it.
- But it will be published.

53:33.500 --> 53:36.890
Excuse me, I was on my way home.

53:38.700 --> 53:42.329
But your book has been accepted?

53:42.460 --> 53:48.933
<i>Erik knew that in S. E. Dahl's mind, he
and Mathis were now indistinguishable.</i>

54:07.020 --> 54:08.339
Phillip?

54:34.420 --> 54:36.172
What's wrong?

54:37.780 --> 54:39.372
I just don't feel...

54:39.660 --> 54:43.096
I couldn't sleep... and...

54:51.620 --> 54:55.090
It helps to turn up the volume.

54:55.620 --> 54:59.852
I took a little too much Seroquel

54:59.980 --> 55:01.891
I couldn't sleep!

55:13.620 --> 55:15.656
You're taking your medication?

55:23.540 --> 55:26.850
Did something happen
between you and Kari?

55:26.980 --> 55:29.938
Don't baby-sit me.
I need time to myself.

55:39.980 --> 55:41.015
No problem.

56:17.740 --> 56:19.139
Hello?

56:19.860 --> 56:21.213
Hi.

56:21.580 --> 56:24.333
Why did you buy me a plane ticket?

56:25.820 --> 56:27.572
Did you look at the date?

56:30.300 --> 56:31.300
The exact same date

56:31.420 --> 56:32.853
as the last time we went.

56:36.060 --> 56:38.051
You can't just assume that

56:38.180 --> 56:41.252
I can, or want to, go to Paris.

56:41.380 --> 56:43.416
No pressure.

56:49.060 --> 56:51.255
But can you at least consider it?

57:11.580 --> 57:14.060
Lars mentioned that Phillip
and Kari were going to Paris again.

57:14.780 --> 57:17.977
Erik pretended that Phillip
had already told him.

57:31.820 --> 57:37.133
He studied chemistry. Was brilliant.
The best in his class.

57:37.500 --> 57:40.731
He got headhunted to some
pharmaceutical company in the USA.

57:42.780 --> 57:45.692
But his girlfriend couldn't handle
a long-distance relationship.

57:47.380 --> 57:51.055
She got depressed. Said
she couldn't function without him.

57:51.940 --> 57:54.500
So he quit his job
and moved back home.

57:54.620 --> 57:59.740
After a few weeks, she dumped him.
Didn't really love him anymore.

57:59.860 --> 58:04.456
He was unable to go back to work.
Now he lives with his mom.

58:13.420 --> 58:15.809
You live with your mom, don't you?

58:24.700 --> 58:26.258
Hi, Lillian!

58:31.100 --> 58:34.331
She's probably frigid.
Any girl that pretty is.

58:34.460 --> 58:38.339
- You would know, who's cilibate.
- Cilibate?

58:39.660 --> 58:41.332
- You mean celibate.

58:42.500 --> 58:43.728
- Right, cilibate.

58:44.860 --> 58:48.978
Maybe cilibate is how farmers say it,
but in civilization we say -

58:49.460 --> 58:51.655
- celibate with an e
- You know what I meant.

58:54.100 --> 58:55.419
Tonight?

58:57.340 --> 59:02.812
I don't know. I have to try
to write while Phillip is away.

59:04.740 --> 59:06.139
Thank you.

59:06.660 --> 59:09.413
You're so cool!

59:09.540 --> 59:15.297
I'll call you tomorrow.
I love you. Bye.

59:16.820 --> 59:18.856
It's so embarrassing.

59:19.140 --> 59:22.974
Anyway, my point is
that you need to get laid.

59:25.260 --> 59:30.175
- Why don't you go see Lillian?
- I thought maybe we could...

59:31.900 --> 59:36.052
- I can get laid whenever I want.
- With that Hitler Youth haircut?

59:37.540 --> 59:41.169
I'm out of here. Bye.

59:41.420 --> 59:43.012
Bye!

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:31.970
- We were on the 4th floor last time.
- This room is nice.

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:38.532
- We had a nice time?
- Absolutely.

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:42.290
I may have been a little nervous.

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.373
- How did I seem to you?

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.580
- You seemed happy.

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:02.298
What did we do the next day?

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:08.656
We sat at a café
and talked for ages.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.578
- What was the weather like?
- Raining, I think.

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:21.056
- What did we talk about?
- Everything. I can't remember.

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:23.410
But it was nice.

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:29.859
What was I like? Was I happy?

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.615
- Don't you remember?
- Sure.

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:41.097
I'm glad you came.

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:45.096
You were thinking about Rune.

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:51.092
I decided I had to make you
fall in love with me.

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:55.616
- You were unsure of your feelings.
- No, I wasn't.

01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.212
Sure you were.

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:05.178
Anyway, it worked.
It worked because I told you first.

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:09.413
"When I reach zero,
you'll fall in love with me."

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.575
Ten.

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:25.573
Nine.

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.893
Eight.

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.177
What are you doing?

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.452
Seven, six...

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.739
Five.

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:41.859
Four.

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.053
Three.

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.294
Two.

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.538
One.

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.293
Zero.

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:30.617
You must have sat and slid down.
Your skirt had been pulled up.

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:37.056
Don't worry.
You looked incredible.

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.608
- It feels stupid.
- Don't worry about that.

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.937
- Can't we...
- Come on!

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:01.293
Come on.

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.570
Look to the left.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:09.452
A little down.

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:15.611
Gather your legs.

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:18.418
It's uncomfortable.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:41.288
- We had sex the second night.
- They know what "sex" means.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:45.812
No they don't. It's just
strange noises to them.

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:49.929
The French don't even understand
English without a French accent.

01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:56.849
I don't think
it was until the third night.

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:11.939
- Why was I so nervous?
- You were so cute.

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:16.332
You kept talking about
how the first time never is any good.

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:50.219
No, wait.

01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:24.851
What's the matter?

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:30.410
What are you thinking about?

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.293
Nothing.

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:47.256
Say something.

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.373
Why did you want us
to come back here?

01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:01.053
You don't love me anymore,
is that it?

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.331
I don't know.

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:14.728
Of course you know.

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:51.618
FALL

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:29.609
Erik Hoiaas is here.
Your book has just been published.

01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:32.379
"Pro-so-po-peia."

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:38.533
You write about madness. Do you
have a personal connection to that?

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:44.089
Well... "Prosopopeia", isn't really...

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:47.371
It isn't really about madness.

01:09:47.939 --> 01:09:52.058
The personal is on a different
level than the biographical.

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:59.252
But the protagonist is searching
for "the absolute language".

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:03.775
A language which can grasp
all the world's nuances.

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:07.257
And that is a madness of sorts.

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:14.175
A strong personal experience
can become an intense story.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:16.053
But what I meant to say...

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:24.138
Giving details of personal suffering
has become a tabloid requirement.

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:30.009
Bringing up
all sorts of personal "tragedies".

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.932
But that's not real "literature" is it?

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:37.374
John Pedersen,
you became an author late in life.

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.849
Your story
is titled "The Long Journey Back".

01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:50.339
I never thought I would become
an author. But when things...

01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:58.535
- Hi, Phillip.
- Hi, Erik Hoiaas, long time no see.

01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:03.811
- How's it going?
- I'm not really sure.

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:09.330
I don't know if you saw me on TV.
It didn't go well.

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:13.890
Forget about that. Come on over.
Geir and Morten are here.

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.497
It's been a while.

01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:22.650
I don't know.
I'm going to Lillian's.

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:25.417
So nothing's changed there?

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.732
Then bring her with you.

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:33.771
We've been invited
to a party at Lars'.

01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:41.374
<i>Two months earlier Lars felt obliged to
mingle with his fellow med-students.</i>

01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:43.692
<i>No one had heard from him since.</i>

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:49.338
<i>That night Lars had mingled quite
a lot with a girl: Merethe.</i>

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.773
Does Lars have a girlfriend?

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:52.900
My God!

01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:56.540
Then we have no choice.

01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:58.973
OK.

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:03.740
<i>Lillian was understanding
as always when Erik said:</i>

01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:07.894
Phillip rang.
He doesn't feel well.

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.736
21? This must be it.

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.659
Hey...

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:49.454
I can't take it. It's too sad.

01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:37.651
- Hey there.
- Hey. Well... quite a party!

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:43.814
And <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy!</i>
Out svimming with commoners?

01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:47.137
We were about to leave,
but now things are picking up.

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:53.295
- I brought my friend Johanne.
- Nice to meet you.

01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:58.620
Come on in.

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:09.058
Sorry.

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:12.332
Are you all right?

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:15.778
Do you know Bjorn?

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:18.094
Yes.

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.494
- What's your name?
- Geir.

01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:43.336
Hi, Geir

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:21.620
Ingrid?

01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:24.819
Ingrid!

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:15.132
We've had another complaint.
Can you please...

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:36.814
Henning!

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:40.729
Choke on black cock in hell,
you politically correct fascist cunt!

01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:16.212
Get some sleep.

01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:19.819
Bye.

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:41.494
Five.

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.053
Four.

01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:44.454
Three.

01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:45.695
Two.

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:47.419
One.

01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:48.540
Zero.

01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:54.820
Ten.

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:57.095
Nine.

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:01.417
Eight, seven, six, five...

01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:05.614
Four, three, two, one...

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.058
Lillian?

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:21.779
Hi.

01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:25.615
- How nice.
- Not a word, Erik.

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:31.732
Don't touch me.

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:35.773
Lillian... Hey, come sit down.

01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:40.098
I've had enough. Not just because
we never see each other.

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:45.420
It's that you pretend to care,
when you're so damn selfish.

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:54.739
You're such a damn cliché!

01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:01.817
Don't call me.

01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:09.776
Is he awake?

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:26.972
So you've seen it?

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:39.176
FORM WITHOUT SUBSTANCE.

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:41.132
Want a cup of tea?

01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:54.411
Hi, Phillip.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.136
No, I'm a little...

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:03.529
What? You've written something?

01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:18.098
Well...

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:21.493
This is...

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:29.814
A lot of it is good, but we've
always been honest with each other.

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:34.215
This isn't your best work.

01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:43.295
But it's cool
that you're writing.

01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:01.620
What?

01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:10.249
I'm glad you take it like that.

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:17.493
It just seems... disjointed.
Even for me who knows your style.

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:23.138
I mean, you haven't
slept all night.

01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:28.857
But there is something here.

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:35.697
Your water metaphor
relating to emotional distance, -

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:40.054
- but then that glides into
this erotic thing...

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:44.657
There's a lot here you can work on.

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.730
I don't think so.

01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:54.410
- It's only the first draft.
Don't try to be nice.

01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:59.250
I'm not being nice. If you work on it
this might be publishable.

01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:02.178
That isn't important.
I'm just writing for myself.

01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:08.053
- A lot of this is good.
- No, it isn't!

01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:10.091
Why can you never say what you mean?

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:18.973
I mean... You're a great writer.

01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:26.415
All I've ever done is to recycle
Sten Egil Dahl and Tor Ulven.

01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:30.455
It's no big deal.

01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:43.418
- Is that recycled Sten Egil Dahl too?
- I don't know.

01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:54.090
What do you mean?

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:22.578
- What the fuck are you doing?
- He's mine.

01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:25.134
- Svein?
- Sorry, Erik.

01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:27.457
I'm not a homo!

01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:30.659
You're Erik Hoiaas, aren't you?

01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:35.097
- Yes.
- I saw you on TV last night.

01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:42.651
- Let me get you to a doctor.
- No, I'm fine.

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:46.212
TV is no place to discuss literature.

01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:48.811
I don't know why...

01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.896
I've read your book.

01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:12.372
Great title.

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:17.338
Very good.

01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:25.009
Except for the final part.

01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:28.457
Don't try to be poetic.

01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:35.736
- Are you serious?
- Yes. But the rest was good.

01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:39.011
Very promising.

01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:53.093
You...

01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:59.769
You look much better now.

01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:04.889
How do you feel?

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:08.931
Much better. Much better.

01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:15.449
<i>An idea had begun to take shape.</i>

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.094
<i>Two days later,
- as he lay in bed, irritated by -</i>

01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:21.098
<i>- the lights from his stereo,
that couldn't be turned off, -</i>

01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:27.534
<i>- it came to him:
He had to get out of Oslo.</i>

01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:14.299
Ten.

01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:18.534
Nine.

01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:22.134
Eight.

01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:27.498
Seven. Six.

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:40.808
Five.

01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:46.259
Four.

01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:50.059
Three.

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:54.418
Two.

01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:58.492
One.

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:04.728
Zero.

01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:09.890
Hello, my name is Kari Brekke.
May I speak to Linda Saugstad?

01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:14.415
- Hello, my name is...
- Kari?

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:18.617
I found you.
I managed to find you.

01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:22.491
You know where I work.

01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:30.531
It was always meant to be.
There were just so many things...

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:37.016
Something links us together.
I found you here, right?

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:46.815
Everything was a mess.

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:55.380
There was something that...

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.616
Excuse me.

01:29:57.740 --> 01:29:59.617
Can I help you?

01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:09.252
- Listen to me.
- Kari?

01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:15.852
I love you, Kari.
Everything is in synch now.

01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:19.056
I love you. I love you.

01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:21.978
Stop it!

01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:25.051
I can't take this anymore...

01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:35.571
Phillip, hey...

01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.259
Hey...

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:43.013
Phillip?

01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:47.216
- Kari?
- Just...

01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:53.536
Come on.

01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:56.618
Get up.

01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:54.895
<i>Erik would have left without saying
goodbye to Phillip or his friends.</i>

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:02.252
<i>He would have found a small
apartment where he could write.</i>

01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:10.337
<i>Erik would have let nothing interfere
with his creative impulses.</i>

01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:16.854
<i>Paradoxically, missing friends
and family would have inspired him.</i>

01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:31.655
<i>After months of hard work,
he would've completed his novel.</i>

01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:36.172
<i>The next fall Erik's second book
would be published in Norway.</i>

01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:41.931
<i>The book would've gotten mixed reviews
and sparked a literary debate</i>

01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:45.655
<i>- a professor from Denmark
would say in an article:</i>

01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:51.855
Norway now has two authors of interest:
Sten Egil Dahl and Erik Hoiaas.

01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:57.657
<i>Erik would feel distanced from
this fuss, working on his new book.</i>

01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:03.332
<i>Surprisingly, it was a first novel that
was the big hit that fall:</i>

01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:06.452
<i>A coming of age, Oslo epic:</i> Roundabout

01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:11.610
It's an attack on the World Bank,
the North-South conflict.

01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:18.737
- That may not be obvious to everyone.
- No, but all the more important.

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:20.498
Buy it, it's important!

01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:36.532
<i>After a year abroad, Erik would have
felt it was time to come home.</i>

01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:47.331
<i>They would have met again at a café.
Or at a restaurant...</i>

01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:51.415
<i>No, it would have been at a wedding.</i>

01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:14.533
Kari is cool.

01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:21.969
She's my nurse. Makes sure
I take my medicine, get dressed, -

01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:23.658
- gives me sponge baths...

01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:31.494
Nah, actually, we're pretty happy.

01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:38.371
You all have girlfriends.
Traitors!

01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:42.617
You didn't give us a choice,
running off like that.

01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:45.460
Quisling.

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:50.259
- I'm back at the university.

01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:53.019
- Studying what?

01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:58.168
It may seem stupid,
but I'm studying psychology.

01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:00.898
That's great!

01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:04.217
<i>Erik would've feared she thought
he was ironic.</i>

01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:07.776
<i>He truly thought it was
a touching expression of love.</i>

01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:11.331
- He killed himself?
- Yes.

01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:15.015
- I thought you knew.
- No.

01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:17.532
A few months ago.

01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:20.210
Does anyone know why?

01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:26.729
Well, he only had two fans.

01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:33.014
One went nuts, the other fled
the country. That was the straw...

01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:35.692
No, I don't know.

01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:42.652
This next song is dedicated to
my brother Geir, the politician.

01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:48.818
Let's hope he doesn't get
"Fingerfucked by the Prime Minister"!

01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:42.734
<i>The next day Phillip would have told
Erik how much he liked his book.</i>

01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:46.575
<i>They would've discussed
S. E. Dahl's suicide,</i>

01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:49.374
<i>- before Phillip
said he had run into Svein.</i>

01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:53.135
- He seemed upset about hurting you.
- Me?

01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:58.052
<i>Phillip's comments would inspire
Erik to keep working on his next novel.</i>

01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:07.338
How about you?
Aren't you going to write?

01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:10.169
No, I don't think so.

01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:18.730
Though maybe the spirit will
move me again, like last time.

01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:56.971
- Ten, nine...
- Stop it.

01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:01.775
Eight, seven, six, five...

01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:06.013
Four.

01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:07.899
Three.

01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:10.939
Two.

01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:13.570
One.

01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:15.213
Stop (The End)
