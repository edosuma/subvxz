12:02.012 --> 12:04.932
WHAT?!

12:18.112 --> 12:20.865
WHY DOES FAYMEN
HAVE TO MOVE?!

12:20.948 --> 12:22.491
{\an7}IF YOU HAD A FRIEND
WHO MOVED AWAY, REMEMBER:

12:22.575 --> 12:26.036
{\an7}TALK IS CHEAP.
ESPECIALLY AFTER 8.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.205
{\an7}AND WITH TODAY'S
WEB COMMUNICATION,

12:28.289 --> 12:31.834
{\an7}STAY IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH IM-ING,
TEXT MESSAGES, AND WEB CAMS.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.753
{\an1}IT'LL BE LIKE
FAYMEN NEVER MOVED!

12:37.214 --> 12:39.675
OR, PILLOW BOY,

12:39.758 --> 12:41.802
{\an5}WE COULD FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO GET FAYMEN
TO STAY.

12:41.886 --> 12:42.720
TALK TO FAYMEN

12:42.803 --> 12:43.220
{\an1}AND FIND OUT WHY
HE'S MOVING.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.514
THAT'S THE FIRST STEP.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.164
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.708
I DIDN'T.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.377
BUT I CAN'T
GO OUT WITH YOU.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.379
I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I CAN'T.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.881
{\an1}WHY NOT?!

13:18.964 --> 13:21.217
BECAUSE, UM...
I'M MOVING...

13:21.300 --> 13:23.511

A JOB RUNNING THE
COCONUT FACTORY.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.640
I BEGGED HIM
NOT TO MOVE,

13:27.723 --> 13:29.934
BUT IT'S A GOOD
JOB, YOU KNOW,

13:30.017 --> 13:31.769
WORKING
WITH COCONUTS.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.354
IT'S JUST
TOO FAR DISTANCE

13:33.437 --> 13:34.104
FOR US TO BE
MORE THAN FRIENDS.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.981
I'M SORRY.

13:38.025 --> 13:40.277
UGH!

13:57.503 --> 13:58.754
MOZE IS LOSING IT,

13:58.837 --> 14:00.297
BUT WHO COULD
BLAME HER, RIGHT?

14:00.381 --> 14:02.049
AND YOU WANTED
TO SAY SOMETHING?

14:02.132 --> 14:06.554
{\an5}JUST THAT I'M
REALLY GLAD WE'RE
GOING OUT NOW.

14:12.893 --> 14:16.480
{\an5}I HAVE NO IDEA
WHY PARENTS SEND ME
BACK TO BRAZIL.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.357
{\an1}THEY COME HERE 11:00
TO TALK TO CRUBBS

14:18.440 --> 14:20.943
{\an1}TO TAKE ME OUT
OF SCHOOL.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.529

TO KEEPING FAYMEN
AT POLK.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.340
{\an1}WHAT? THIS COULD
GET UGLY.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.051
SIMON, I HEARD
YOU'RE MOVING.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.470
WHAT?

14:48.554 --> 14:50.264
OH, RIGHT!

14:50.347 --> 14:53.100

TAKE AWHILE.

14:53.183 --> 14:55.352

INTERESTED IN,

15:17.708 --> 15:19.126
BUT I NEED SOME
INFORMATION FIRST.

15:19.209 --> 15:21.170
{\an5}WHY ARE FAYMEN'S
PARENTS TAKING HIM
OUT OF SCHOOL?

15:21.253 --> 15:24.256
FORGET IT. MY MEETING
WITH FAYMEN'S PARENTS

15:24.340 --> 15:26.091
IS CONFIDENTIAL.

15:26.175 --> 15:26.800
I KNOW THINGS
ABOUT THIS SCHOOL.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.136
I HEAR THINGS.
I WRITE THEM DOWN.

YOU WANT TO KNOW.

15:29.928 --> 15:32.181
SO LET ME KNOW
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW,

15:32.264 --> 15:33.766
AND I'LL LET
YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW?

YOU'RE BLUFFING.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.186
I GUESS YOU'LL
FIND THAT OUT.

15:37.269 --> 15:40.147
BUT BY THAT TIME,
IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

15:41.940 --> 15:44.610
{\an4}OK. FAYMEN'S
FLUNKING OUT OF
ALL OF HIS CLASSES.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.029
HIS PARENTS SAY
HE'S NOT EATING,

15:47.112 --> 15:48.947
{\an1}SEEMS IN A FOG,
AND THEY'RE CONCERNED

15:49.031 --> 15:51.075
{\an4}HE HASN'T BROUGHT
ANY FRIENDS OVER
TO MEET THEM.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.493
{\an1}NOW YOUR INFORMATION.

PIE. BYE!

16:02.169 --> 16:03.170
UGH!

16:06.465 --> 16:08.217

THINK HE'S DEPRESSED

16:08.300 --> 16:09.176
AND HAS NO FRIENDS,

16:09.259 --> 16:09.843
{\an1}AND THAT'S WHY
HIS GRADES ARE POOP?

WE HAVE TO DO

16:12.137 --> 16:12.596

17:59.745 --> 18:00.496
OK, DUDE, WE GOTTA TALK
ABOUT THIS PILLOW THING,

18:00.579 --> 18:03.332
'CAUSE IT'S REALLY NOT--

18:05.459 --> 18:06.877
I'M BUSY.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.021
HE WENT THAT WAY!
HE'S LOST HIS MIND!

18:26.105 --> 18:26.522
SAID HE WAS RUNNING
ALL THE WAY

18:41.787 --> 18:43.914
EVELYN GAVE ME A RING,
SO I SAID I WAS MOVING.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.457
THEN LISA'S SAD,

18:45.541 --> 18:47.417
{\an1}SO I SAY MOVE TOMORROW,
WE DANCE,

18:47.501 --> 18:48.418
THEN MANY GIFTS COME.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.670

18:52.130 --> 18:53.632
WHY DID YOU LET IT
GET THIS FAR?

18:53.715 --> 18:54.675
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

18:54.758 --> 18:58.011
{\an4}I WAS THINKING
YOU'D TELL ME HOW
TO GET OUT OF IT.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.388
{\an1}HOW DO I
GET OUT OF IT?

18:59.471 --> 19:00.722
[CLOCK TICKING]

19:00.806 --> 19:01.557
JUST TELL THEM
YOUR DAD DECIDED

19:01.640 --> 19:03.433
NOT TO TAKE THE JOB
AND YOU'RE STAYING,

19:03.517 --> 19:05.227
BUT DO IT BEFORE
THE PARTY STARTS

19:05.310 --> 19:06.395
SO NO FEELINGS
GET HURT.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.397
RIGHT!

19:08.480 --> 19:13.318
{\an5}IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO SAY TO CLASS
BEFORE PARTY STARTS?

19:15.571 --> 19:18.866
LET'S DANCE!

19:22.202 --> 19:24.496
UGH!

19:24.580 --> 19:25.998
OH.

19:26.081 --> 19:30.168
ALL OF THIS TALK
ABOUT FAYMEN DOING POORLY

19:30.252 --> 19:32.921
IS JUST SO MUCH
JIBBERY-JABBERY-JIBBERY.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.591
FAYMEN'S SMART.
KIDS LOVE FAYMEN.

19:35.674 --> 19:36.925
FAYMEN, FAYMEN, FAYMEN!

19:37.009 --> 19:40.137
{\an1}SO, YOU THINK
HE SHOULD STAY?

19:40.220 --> 19:40.929
OH, YEAH.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.599
{\an1}I MEAN, I'M NOT JUST
A VICE PRINCIPAL,

19:43.682 --> 19:45.851
I'M A DOCTOR.

19:45.934 --> 19:49.104
{\an1}I THINK IF YOU TAKE FAYMEN
BACK TO BRAZIL TOO SOON,

19:49.187 --> 19:51.231
IT COULD BE BAD
FOR HIS HEALTH.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.317
HE'D GET RICKETS.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.693
WELL, IN THIS CASE,

19:54.776 --> 19:56.278
I THINK
HE SHOULD STAY.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.279
{\an1}YES, YES.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.155
GOOD CHOICE.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.740
FAYMEN STAYING
IS A GOOD CHOICE.

19:59.823 --> 20:02.201
FAYMEN WILL STAY.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.827
WE APPRECIATE
YOUR HONESTY.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.245
YOU ARE ONE OF A KIND.

20:11.835 --> 20:15.213
WELL, THIS
SHOULD BE FUN.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.091

20:20.552 --> 20:22.429
[DANCING MUSIC PLAYING]

20:25.557 --> 20:27.851
{\an1}MAYBE WE SHOULD KISS

NOT MOVING!

20:29.978 --> 20:32.147
[STAMMERING]

20:32.230 --> 20:33.148
SHE'S RIGHT.

20:33.231 --> 20:34.983
{\an1}MY DAD DECIDED
NOT TO TAKE THE JOB.

20:35.067 --> 20:41.156
THEN WE HAVE...
WELCOME BACK PARTY!

20:41.240 --> 20:45.077
BUT THERE NEVER
WAS A JOB!

20:45.160 --> 20:48.163
{\an5}YOU SEE, SINCE
I NATURALLY NEVER
TRUST PEOPLE,

20:48.246 --> 20:49.665
I RESEARCHED IT.

20:49.748 --> 20:50.999

IS NOT FOR SALE.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.043
THERE ARE NO COCONUT
FACTORIES IN HAWAII,

20:53.126 --> 20:54.670
AND I
CALLED HIS DAD,

20:54.753 --> 20:57.339
AND HE SAID SIMON
IS IN BIG TROUBLE.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.343
SO YOU WERE
NEVER MOVING?

21:03.553 --> 21:04.388
I WANT MY GIFT BACK.

21:06.974 --> 21:10.018
WELL...HE LIED TO US,

21:10.102 --> 21:14.773
{\an1}BUT WE SHOULD STILL
LET HIM HAVE HIS CAKE.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.653
I PROBABLY DESERVE THIS.

21:21.279 --> 21:22.739
NO WONDER FAYMEN
IS IN FOG.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.533
THIS PLACE IS CRAZY!

21:24.616 --> 21:26.034

TO BE PRINCIPALS.

ARE CRAZY, YES.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.505
AND IN TROUBLE.

21:38.588 --> 21:41.508
{\an5}BUT FAYMEN'S
NOT A BAD STUDENT
OR DEPRESSED,

21:41.591 --> 21:44.761
{\an1}AND I CAN EXPLAIN
HIS LOSS OF APPETITE.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.055
HOW? WHAT IS WRONG
WITH MY SON?

21:47.139 --> 21:50.017
{\an1}HE'S IN LOVE!

21:50.100 --> 21:51.893
{\an1}HE'S IN FULL-ON
CRUSH MODE.

21:51.977 --> 21:52.769
{\an1}CAN'T THINK ABOUT MATH
'CAUSE HE'S THINKING

21:52.853 --> 21:55.022

21:55.105 --> 21:56.481
I SEE IT ALL THE TIME.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.358
{\an1}IS IT TRUE,
FAYMEN?

22:00.110 --> 22:02.904
{\an1}TAKING FAYMEN
OUT OF POLK NOW

22:02.988 --> 22:04.281
{\an1}WOULD REALLY
CRUSH HIM.

22:04.364 --> 22:05.782
OH, YEAH.

22:04.364 --> 22:05.782
YEAH.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.075
{\an1}THEN HE MIGHT GET
DEPRESSED FOR REAL.

OH!

22:07.159 --> 22:08.368
YEAH.

22:08.452 --> 22:12.414
AND SOMETHING TELLS ME
