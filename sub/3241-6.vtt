WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.341
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.420 --> 00:05.422
<i>I'd seemed to have fallen through time.</i>

00:05.506 --> 00:06.849
You need not be scared of me,

00:06.965 --> 00:09.184
nor anyone else here,
so long as I'm with ye.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.394
I'm leaving tomorrow,
and I'm taking you with me.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.431
<i>I think it would be wise
to have a healer along.</i>

00:14.765 --> 00:15.937
You're not Frank.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.063
No, madam. lam not.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.485
You know Black Jack Randall?

00:18.560 --> 00:21.484
I won't risk you or anyone else
being taken prisoner by that man.

00:21.563 --> 00:25.033
<i>Captain of dragoons
in the British army,</i>

00:25.108 --> 00:26.781
<i>and your direct ancestor.</i>

00:26.944 --> 00:28.116
Exactly.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.822
Otherwise known as "Black Jack."

00:29.947 --> 00:32.119
Flagged me twice
in the space of a week.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.373
<i>The activities Dougal and his men
were involved in,</i>

00:35.452 --> 00:36.749
<i>they were political.</i>

00:36.828 --> 00:39.627
<i>Dougal was raising money
for a Jacobite army.</i>

00:40.541 --> 00:41.667
Pleasure to see you again.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.924
Once more I ask you,
is everything all right?

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

02:20.515 --> 02:23.485
Tell me, madam.
Are you here by your own choice?

02:34.279 --> 02:36.498
I appreciate your
concern, Lieutenant,

02:36.573 --> 02:37.790
and I can assure you

02:38.659 --> 02:40.582
I am a guest of the Clan MacKenzie.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.177
As you wish.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.799
Nevertheless, I am certain
my commander

02:50.879 --> 02:52.096
will wish to speak with you.

02:52.214 --> 02:53.932
He's presently in residence
at the inn at Brockton.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.434
Will you accompany me?

02:55.509 --> 02:59.514
Well, if the lady goes, I go.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.316
Very well then.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.704
<i>Even though
I wasn't going by my own choice,</i>

03:15.779 --> 03:18.703
<i>I still felt a heaviness
leave my breast.</i>

03:18.782 --> 03:20.625
<i>And for the first time
since I passed through</i>

03:20.701 --> 03:23.079
<i>the standing stones at Craigh na Dun,</i>

03:23.161 --> 03:26.131
<i>I found myself surrounded
by my own people.</i>

03:26.748 --> 03:29.752
<i>They might be
called Redcoats instead of Tommies,</i>

03:29.835 --> 03:31.428
<i>but they were still the British army</i>

03:31.503 --> 03:33.881
<i>I had been a part of
for six long years.</i>

03:34.965 --> 03:37.844
<i>And somehow
it felt liberating to be looked upon</i>

03:37.926 --> 03:39.974
<i>with sympathy and respect</i>

03:40.262 --> 03:42.560
<i>instead of hostility and suspicion.</i>

03:53.525 --> 03:56.574
<i>I knew only too well
what Dougal was feeling.</i>

03:58.238 --> 04:00.332
<i>A Scottish village it may be,</i>

04:00.407 --> 04:02.751
<i>and on MacKenzie land at that,</i>

04:02.909 --> 04:06.163
<i>but for Dougal,
it was now enemy territory,</i>

04:06.246 --> 04:08.624
<i>and he was the outlander.</i>

04:39.404 --> 04:40.747
Dismount.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.292
Each man see to it that his horse
is grained and watered.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.213
I would not entrust their care
to our Scottish hosts.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.715
If you'll follow me.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.605
My Lord, may I present Mrs. Claire
Beauchamp and Mr. Dougal...

05:12.687 --> 05:14.781
Come in. Come in.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.659
This is a happy surprise.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.986
A most enjoyable surprise.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.323
It has been far too long
since I last gazed

05:22.405 --> 05:24.908
upon a lovely English rose.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.709
The lieutenant here claims you have
quite the story to tell.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.082
I'm so grateful
you're willing to listen to it.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.092
No, nonsense. I love stories.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.003
I've not heard a good one
since I first set foot

05:36.086 --> 05:37.804
upon this blasted turf.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.307
You must be absolutely famished.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.846
I hope venison is to your liking.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.849
Only the very best quality,
I assure you.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.305
Thank you.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.856
I shot the beast myself.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.059
It's a great country for hunting,
I'll give them that.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.018
The cheese is
surprisingly edible too,

05:52.102 --> 05:55.606
and the claret is my own,
bottled in '35.

05:55.730 --> 05:56.982
Need I say more?

05:58.942 --> 06:01.115
Now' Lieutenant Foster,
you're going to introduce me

06:01.194 --> 06:03.196
to this noble Scottish gentleman.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.533
My Lord, may I present
Dougal MacKenzie,

06:05.615 --> 06:08.243
war chief to the Clan
MacKenzie and brother to its laird.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.327
You have the honor of meeting

06:09.411 --> 06:11.129
Brigadier General
Sir Oliver Lord Thomas,

06:11.288 --> 06:14.383
Knight of the Bath and commanding
officer of the Northern British Army.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.925
War chief?

06:16.293 --> 06:18.136
I'll say this for you,
you look the part.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.964
A fine specimen of
the local inhabitants, My Lord.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.386
How am I to address you, sir?

06:22.465 --> 06:24.763
Ye kin call me MacKenzie,
if in it please ye'

06:24.843 --> 06:27.437
or if we're being formal,
ye can call me Chief MacKenzie,

06:27.762 --> 06:29.355
which in matters of war and bicker

06:29.431 --> 06:32.150
leaves us ower fae each other
as equals dinnae ye ken.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.023
I don't know about the rest of you,

06:38.106 --> 06:39.483
but I failed to
understand a single word

06:39.566 --> 06:40.988
the creature said.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.240
I believe, My Lord,
he was attempting to say

06:43.320 --> 06:45.698
Chief MacKenzie would be acceptable.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.829
There was more,
but I must confess, it eluded me.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.460
Really...

06:51.995 --> 06:54.839
Someone really ought to teach these
people the King's English.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.922
I believe he's speaking English, sir.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.844
Their form of English anyway.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.343
Well, it's a form that's
damn offensive to the ear.

07:02.422 --> 07:06.017
May I remind you, Lord Thomas,
there are parts of England,

07:06.092 --> 07:07.639
Newcastle comes to mind,

07:07.719 --> 07:12.145
where the local accent is equally
unintelligible to our ears.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.309
Yes, yes, quite right.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.061
You make a fine point, madam.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.364
The world would make a lot more sense
if everybody spoke like Londoners.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.817
If ye wish to hear Londoners speak,

07:22.025 --> 07:23.652
perhaps ye should
have stayed in London.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.826
- My Lord, he says...
- No need, Lieutenant.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.037
I understood him
perfectly well that time.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.089
I would be more than
happy to oblige, sir,

07:40.168 --> 07:42.591
if only you behaved like
the loyal British subjects

07:42.671 --> 07:43.888
you're supposed to be.

07:44.047 --> 07:47.768
That way my troops and I could return
to more civilized environs.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.448
I must say though, I quite enjoy
being a man in the field.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.653
If only my servants moved
as quickly as my soldiers.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.160
If I stay here long enough,
I could become a laird.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.536
Laird Thomas.

08:10.615 --> 08:11.867
What do you think, all?

08:12.534 --> 08:15.003
Only then I supposed I'd have to wear
one of those woolen skirts.

08:15.578 --> 08:18.798
I'm told it's a grave insult
to ask a clansman

08:18.873 --> 08:20.420
what he wears
underneath that thing...

08:20.500 --> 08:21.501
It's called a kilt, sir.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.007
I know perfectly well
what it's called, Lieutenant.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.387
So tell me,

08:27.799 --> 08:29.676
from one laird to another...

08:29.759 --> 08:31.978
Are ye purposely trying
to embarrass the lass,

08:32.095 --> 08:33.768
or are ye just an arrogant wee smout?

08:34.014 --> 08:36.392
Good Christ, man.
Do you know to whom you speak?

08:36.558 --> 08:38.059
You watch your words, sir,
or I'll have you.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.611
Well, you pull that needle,
and we'll see who pricks who.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.607
Dougal, Lieutenant, enough.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.776
You're both behaving like children.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.369
Yes, yes, quite right. Quite right.

08:48.486 --> 08:51.239
The lady's sense of propriety
puts us all to shame.

08:51.322 --> 08:54.451
The question of the kilt
will remain an enigma.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.330
My word, madam.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.548
If I were brave enough,
I would commission you

09:00.623 --> 09:02.717
a colonel in one of my regiments.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.636
You do know how to order men about.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.339
Aye, she does that.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.514
Well, it's been
a delight meeting you,

09:14.596 --> 09:16.974
but I am afraid
the venison is losing its heat.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.985
I would ask you to join us,
but <i>as</i> you can see,

09:21.144 --> 09:22.691
no room.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.034
Beastly sorry.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.745
You can keep your scraps.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.831
They're still sewing
good Scottish ale in the tap room.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.584
I'll be downstairs.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.343
How are we ever going to make peace

09:46.419 --> 09:49.172
with such an ill-mannered people?

10:19.828 --> 10:21.045
I must say, Mrs. Beauchamp,

10:21.121 --> 10:24.045
you've had the most
mesmerizing adventure.

10:24.207 --> 10:28.462
Yes, indeed,
but having been brought here

10:28.545 --> 10:31.298
and having met all of
you charming gentlemen,

10:31.631 --> 10:33.725
I do hope
that my adventure is now over.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.222
Yes.

10:35.385 --> 10:38.184
I would've thought you've
had quite enough of Scotland.

10:38.263 --> 10:41.688
In truth, I found
the countryside most beautiful,

10:42.058 --> 10:44.231
my stay not altogether unpleasant,

10:44.602 --> 10:48.232
but my greatest wish now
is to be reunited with my family.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.074
Yes, yes.

10:50.441 --> 10:51.658
France.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.950
Lieutenant Foster,
I imagine there'd be no difficulty

10:55.029 --> 10:56.656
in escorting
Mrs. Beauchamp to Inverness,

10:56.739 --> 10:59.663
where she may book passage
to wherever it pleases her to go.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.085
No difficulty at all, sir.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.754
I would be forever grateful.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.754
It's a trifle, madam.
You have my word on it.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.002
Well, in that case,

11:09.085 --> 11:10.632
I will have a little bit more wine.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.432
I believe we'll all join you.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.691
<i>Inverness, and from there
only a brief journey</i>

11:22.765 --> 11:25.268
<i>would take me to the
stones at Craigh na Dun</i>

11:25.435 --> 11:27.938
<i>and a chance to
return to my own time.</i>

11:29.564 --> 11:31.191
To homeward journeys.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.823
May they be uneventful.

11:34.277 --> 11:35.904
My Lord, are you aware
that at this very moment...

11:35.987 --> 11:37.534
Captain Randall,
are we under attack, sir?

11:38.364 --> 11:39.786
We are not.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.997
You're putting the claret at risk.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.828
I suggest
you step outside and rid yourself

11:43.912 --> 11:45.539
of half a league's worth of dust.

11:45.872 --> 11:49.172
By all means,
we must protect the claret.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.478
Am I mistaken,
or do you two know each other?

12:07.352 --> 12:11.027
For a moment there,
the lady did look familiar,

12:11.814 --> 12:13.236
but...

12:14.150 --> 12:16.278
I can see now I was wrong.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.537
I had the same exam experience.

12:21.532 --> 12:22.829
How unusual.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.464
Well, then, Captain Randall,
allow me to present

12:28.539 --> 12:30.507
Mistress Claire Beauchamp
of Oxfordshire.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.840
Captain Jonathan Randall.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.090
Captain.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.468
Charmed.

13:01.572 --> 13:06.203
I trust I am
sufficiently presentable.

13:06.411 --> 13:09.130
Yes, yes, someone pour a glass
for the good captain.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.548
No.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.501
Now, if you'll be so good
as to explain

13:12.583 --> 13:14.176
your purpose for barging in here?

13:14.252 --> 13:16.550
My Lord, at this very instant,

13:16.629 --> 13:20.224
Dougal MacKenzie, war chief of
Clan MacKenzie is downstairs

13:20.508 --> 13:21.555
quaffing ale.

13:22.844 --> 13:24.061
That is not <i>news,</i> Captain.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.435
It was he who brought
Mrs. Beauchamp to us.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.150
Was it indeed?

13:34.063 --> 13:35.815
Do you propose to admonish me, sir?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.951
Perhaps you're of the
opinion that a general

13:39.027 --> 13:40.870
must explain himself to a captain.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.865
No, I meant no offense, sir.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.417
Now you mention it,

13:46.826 --> 13:49.545
an English lady
and a Scottish war chief,

13:51.122 --> 13:54.092
I can! for the life of me
piece that one together.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.012
It's a fascinating tale, Captain.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.598
It's full of robbery and murder.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.098
It's unfortunate you missed it.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.431
I know.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.605
What if Captain Randall
accompanies you to Inverness?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.273
That way you may regale him with
tales of your adventure.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.980
It's sure to make the time fly by.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.534
Mrs. Beauchamp amongst the savages.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.947
Well, I doubt Mrs. Beauchamp would
choose such a provocative title.

14:24.030 --> 14:27.409
The lady claims she was well
treated by her Scottish friends.

14:29.952 --> 14:33.126
I wasn't aware that the English
had any Scottish friends.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.133
I'm sure Private McGreavey
would agree with me,

14:40.296 --> 14:41.718
if he were able.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.138
Do not mention that sad subject.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.434
You'll give
Mrs. Beauchamp the vapors.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.985
I do not easily swoon.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.485
Please, Captain, tell me.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.109
Two weeks ago, Private McGreavey

15:01.192 --> 15:03.570
made the mistake of
wandering away from patrol.

15:04.153 --> 15:07.032
We found him two days later
sitting, legs crossed,

15:07.115 --> 15:10.585
tied to a tree,
his arms folded in his lap.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.128
That sounds more like
a prank than a punishment.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.007
He was cradling
his severed head, madam.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.472
It was a sad day
for Private McGreavey

15:27.552 --> 15:29.350
when he got stationed to Scotland.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.309
For all of us.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.771
Is that all you have to say?

15:45.194 --> 15:46.616
On the road here yesterday,

15:46.696 --> 15:48.323
we came across two Highlanders

15:49.323 --> 15:50.791
hanging from crosses.

15:52.535 --> 15:55.755
The men in my party ascribed
the actions to English soldiers.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.334
If so, then it would be
the result of English justice.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.669
A rough justice, it would seem.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.755
Undoubtedly traitors to a man.

16:04.338 --> 16:07.137
Yeah, so said the letters
carved into their chests,

16:07.383 --> 16:09.306
but I doubt
they were given a trial to prove it.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.475
Well, you can be sure that
Private McGreavey's sentence

16:11.554 --> 16:14.023
was administered
without benefit of trial.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.559
And so both sides
have committed depredations

16:16.642 --> 16:18.189
they should both be ashamed of.

16:18.478 --> 16:22.073
Dog me, that's a woman's view for
you if ever I heard one.

16:22.398 --> 16:26.494
That is why I make it a point never
to discuss politics with a lady.

16:27.069 --> 16:30.118
I was under the impression
we were discussing morality,

16:30.198 --> 16:31.415
not politics.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.290
And I'm forced to question
whether the lady's morality

16:34.744 --> 16:36.542
is any clearer than her politics.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.632
What are you implying, sir?

16:41.125 --> 16:43.548
All this time living with savages,

16:44.212 --> 16:46.510
I have to wonder
if Dougal MacKenzie shared

16:46.589 --> 16:49.138
more than just bread
and shelter with the lady.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.511
Perhaps he has also shared his bed.

16:51.594 --> 16:52.971
How dare you?

16:53.429 --> 16:55.056
That is a scurrilous charge.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.641
You cross a line, sir.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.814
If I am wrong, I apologize.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.778
But what other reason
would the lady have

17:00.853 --> 17:03.072
to choose these barbarians
over her own people?

17:03.689 --> 17:07.569
These aggressors
who wantonly shed English blood?

17:07.652 --> 17:10.576
The Scots just want the same
freedoms we enjoy.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.665
Freedoms we take for granted.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.832
They are not the aggressors, Captain,
we are.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.297
It is their land,
and we are occupying it.

17:25.336 --> 17:28.761
I believe it's the King's land.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.393
I must say, madam,
I find your sympathies

17:36.472 --> 17:38.190
extraordinarily puzzling.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.976
Hear, hear.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.856
I can assure you, Lord Thomas,

17:44.939 --> 17:46.691
my loyalties lie with the King.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.531
No doubt your time here has muddied
your proper English thinking.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.370
My Lord, I think the lady

17:51.445 --> 17:54.119
has lived among the savages too long.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.335
She must be returned to the bosom of
her family as soon as possible.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.673
I could leave for Inverness today,
if you will allow it.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.726
Sir, three enlisted men
have been fired upon

18:13.801 --> 18:15.769
by persons unknown
just outside of town.

18:15.845 --> 18:19.941
Are these Scots rascals that bold
to attack an armed British camp?

18:20.016 --> 18:21.939
My Lord,
I know you've only recently arrived,

18:22.018 --> 18:24.362
but small ambushes
are an almost weekly occurrence.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.522
Yes, thank you, Captain.
I have read the reports.

18:26.647 --> 18:27.694
Any casualties?

18:27.815 --> 18:29.237
One dead. Two wounded.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.910
One of the men, sir,
he's in a bad way.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.075
He's downstairs.
We've sent for the surgeon,

18:33.154 --> 18:34.747
but no one is sure
of his whereabouts.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.373
I'll go.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.414
I've told you.
I have medical experience.

18:45.666 --> 18:48.465
I was right beside him.
Don't you see it could've been me?

18:50.254 --> 18:52.382
- Claire. Are ye all right, lassie?
- I'm fine.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.809
When I saw that bastard
Randall go upstairs...

18:55.509 --> 18:56.726
Jamie and the others
weren't responsible

18:56.802 --> 18:57.894
for this attack, were they?

18:58.054 --> 19:00.603
No. I'll shed no tears
over Redcoat blood,

19:01.140 --> 19:03.939
but my men would never undertake such
an action without my consent.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.315
It's Randall ye need to worry about.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.317
The army will be looking
for someone to blame.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.023
Without proof, they can't hold me.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.742
Still, I'd feel better
if you made yourself scarce.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.904
I'm fine.

19:13.986 --> 19:17.240
Stand aside, and move this bench.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.412
All right, soldier.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.328
<i>When the Germans surrendered,</i>

19:22.411 --> 19:25.085
<i>I thought I'd participated
in my last amputation,</i>

19:25.414 --> 19:27.212
<i>but it seemed as though
I was condemned</i>

19:27.291 --> 19:30.795
<i>to dream about yet more young men
maimed for life on the battlefield.</i>

19:30.878 --> 19:32.300
This arm's going to have to come off.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.178
You can have the loan of my
short sword if it helps.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.724
Sharpened it myself yesterday.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.052
It'll have to do,

19:37.134 --> 19:39.262
and I'm going to need to use
something as a tourniquet.

19:39.387 --> 19:40.764
You can tie his arm with this.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.098
It's my wife's.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.524
Gave it to me for good luck, she did.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.896
All right.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.108
Someone get me some boiling water
and some clean cloth.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.943
- I'm the surgeon here.
- Hurry!

19:50.022 --> 19:51.274
Do you have medical experience?

19:51.357 --> 19:53.325
Enough to know that
you can't save this arm.

19:53.776 --> 19:56.029
You're not going to
faint when I begin to saw?

19:56.112 --> 19:57.284
I've stayed awake through worse.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.911
Grab his knees.
You, take this shoulder.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.867
Opium. Down his throat, if you can.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.207
Sorry, soldier.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.794
Bite, Private.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.876
Bite until your teeth crack.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.546
Steady now.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.164
Nurse Beauchamp.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.500
Are you back from saving lives?

20:48.581 --> 20:49.878
Where's Lord Thomas?

20:49.957 --> 20:52.051
He's off hunting rebels,

20:52.835 --> 20:54.337
not that he'll find any.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.181
Having seen him on a horse,
he'll be lucky to stay in the saddle.

20:58.382 --> 21:01.477
Please try not to speak, Captain.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.772
My barbering skills
aren't up to shaving a moving target.

21:06.432 --> 21:09.185
I haven't been pampered like
this since I was called up.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.690
I should hope not.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.564
I'm the only one
allowed to pamper you,

21:12.646 --> 21:13.898
and don't you forget it.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.609
You'll get no argument from me.

21:17.193 --> 21:20.743
I don't want you
holding a blade to my throat.

21:21.530 --> 21:25.080
A 200-year-old razor
has certainly kept its edge.

21:25.159 --> 21:27.412
Well, it's not just the blade.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.172
It's the beautiful hand
that wields it.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.750
Come here.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.048
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather bring this with you?

21:39.131 --> 21:41.225
What, and risk losing it? God, no.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.803
No, it's been in my family
for far too long.

21:44.470 --> 21:47.599
No, I shall just have to suffer
through a few more rough shaves

21:48.140 --> 21:49.767
till I see you again.

21:51.435 --> 21:52.937
Can you keep it safe for me?

21:55.314 --> 21:57.783
And who is going to keep me safe?

21:59.652 --> 22:01.404
Well, that is my job.

22:12.206 --> 22:14.925
I'm sorry, Captain.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.469
On my life, it was an accident.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.596
On your life?

22:25.344 --> 22:26.561
Sit down.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.808
A soldier needs a steady hand.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.268
Otherwise he will never
hit the target he aims at.

22:34.728 --> 22:37.026
You control your nerves.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.984
Your nerves do not control you.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.450
My' my, aren't we the beardless boy?

22:53.414 --> 22:56.213
Take my things back to my lodgings,

22:56.292 --> 22:58.795
and come back and see to it
that we are not disturbed.

22:59.128 --> 23:00.471
Yes, Captain.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.518
I wish to see Lieutenant Foster.

23:13.601 --> 23:17.071
I'm afraid Foster is gone
with Lord Thomas and the others.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.316
Then I suppose someone else will
have to take me to Inverness?

23:23.152 --> 23:24.324
When the time comes.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.327
Lord Thomas said
I would be leaving today.

23:29.158 --> 23:31.707
And I wouldn't touch
the general's claret.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.753
Perhaps you haven't noticed,

23:33.829 --> 23:36.002
but Lord Thomas is an utter arse.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.756
He agreed to your leaving
before he heard you

23:39.835 --> 23:43.180
make some of your
more troubling statements.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.762
Statements that...

23:46.592 --> 23:49.141
Well, even Lord Thomas
is bright enough to realize

23:49.219 --> 23:52.348
puts your loyalty in
a very questionable light.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.448
Madam...

24:10.616 --> 24:12.084
Ever since our first encounter,

24:12.159 --> 24:14.878
I have been in a state
of extreme discomfort.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.628
I am not sure what you mean, sir,

24:19.291 --> 24:20.964
nor am I sure I want to.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.137
Allow me to put your fears to rest.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.973
I wish to apologize.

24:27.758 --> 24:29.556
That awful day in the woods...

24:32.096 --> 24:33.348
Who are you?

24:35.474 --> 24:37.727
The mere memory of it
leaves me shamed.

24:40.938 --> 24:43.441
Your apology pleases me
more than you know.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.571
I'd hate to think a King's officer

24:45.651 --> 24:47.745
would behave in such
an ungentlemanly manner.

24:48.696 --> 24:50.915
I am not a casual person with women.

24:51.657 --> 24:55.252
I look forward to the opportunity
to reveal my true nature to you,

24:56.578 --> 24:59.957
and I can only hope that
honesty will be met with honesty.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.627
My honesty will match yours, Captain.

25:06.422 --> 25:07.765
Please.

25:24.773 --> 25:28.698
Let us begin with you
telling me who you are

25:28.777 --> 25:31.530
and why you're here in Scotland.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.042
I originally come from Oxfordshire.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.373
- I...
- No.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.792
We pledged honesty, madam.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.753
There are no Beauchamps in
Oxfordshire that I know of.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.055
Well, I would hardly
consider you an expert,

25:48.130 --> 25:50.428
your family hailing from Sussex.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.640
May I ask just how you know that?

25:57.306 --> 25:59.980
Your accent. H's clearly Sussex.

26:01.143 --> 26:04.113
Neither my tutors nor my parents
would be much obliged to hear

26:04.521 --> 26:07.741
that my speech so clearly
reflects my birthplace, madam,

26:08.275 --> 26:10.323
they having gone to
considerable trouble and expense

26:10.444 --> 26:12.162
to remedy it.

26:32.341 --> 26:36.687
You don't have the look of a woman
who would rouge her nipples.

26:39.139 --> 26:42.063
Well, for that, at least,
I suppose I should thank you.

26:45.729 --> 26:48.699
What was your maiden name,
Mrs. Beauchamp?

26:52.027 --> 26:55.247
Captain, I admit I made
some ill-advised comments

26:55.322 --> 26:57.916
in support of
my Scottish acquaintances.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.786
My imprudence should
not be mistaken for treason,

27:00.869 --> 27:03.839
nor should it prevent me
from continuing on my journey.

27:04.039 --> 27:06.212
I have been delayed
far too long already.

27:07.042 --> 27:11.388
Madam, you do not help your case
by adopting this dismissive attitude.

27:12.256 --> 27:14.008
I have no case to help.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.969
Now, I make no claims on you,
the garrison,

27:17.052 --> 27:18.770
or on the MacKenzies for that matter.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.724
My only desire
is to resume my journey in peace,

27:21.807 --> 27:24.026
and I see no reason
why you should object to it.

27:24.101 --> 27:25.353
Don't you?

27:27.229 --> 27:30.153
Well, allow me to enlighten you,

27:30.232 --> 27:32.906
and perhaps my objections
will become clearer.

27:33.443 --> 27:35.821
I found you wandering the countryside

27:35.904 --> 27:38.407
dressed in nothing
but your undergarments.

27:38.699 --> 27:41.999
When I try to question you,
I am struck down

27:42.077 --> 27:44.705
and rendered unconscious
by a villain I later discover

27:44.788 --> 27:47.883
is a member of a band
of Scottish rebels,

27:48.917 --> 27:53.263
a band led by
your companion here today,

27:53.547 --> 27:54.890
Dougal MacKenzie.

27:56.508 --> 28:00.263
These facts paint you either
as an empty-headed trollop

28:00.554 --> 28:03.728
or as an agent in league
with the King's enemies.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.281
Are those my only two choices?

28:10.856 --> 28:14.281
If there is another, madam' I advise
you not to keep it to yourself.

28:21.325 --> 28:22.872
Captain, you...

28:23.911 --> 28:27.757
Force me to reveal things that no
woman should say out loud.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.219
It was an affair of the heart.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.262
I met him in England.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.310
An officer of infantry.

28:41.803 --> 28:45.353
He swore to me that I held
his affections like no other.

28:48.852 --> 28:52.652
So when he was
stationed in Scotland, I...

28:53.065 --> 28:54.738
I followed him.

29:00.322 --> 29:02.324
Please. Carry on.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.290
It was then I...

29:07.079 --> 29:09.923
Discovered he was
a most licentious man,

29:12.334 --> 29:14.507
a rake and whoremonger.

29:15.504 --> 29:18.678
It was not love he felt for me.
It was lust.

29:27.641 --> 29:31.236
When I refused him, he attacked me.

29:31.645 --> 29:33.693
I fled' dressed only in my shift.

29:45.367 --> 29:49.713
I can only hope you prove yourself
the gentleman you claim to be.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.709
Do not pry any further.

30:53.310 --> 30:55.062
What is the man's name?

31:00.442 --> 31:04.037
With all due respect, Captain,

31:04.988 --> 31:08.117
I do not wish to lower myself
to this gentleman's level.

31:10.535 --> 31:14.165
By revealing his name as well as
his indiscretions to you,

31:16.500 --> 31:20.300
I risk ruining both his career
and his reputation.

31:41.316 --> 31:42.738
Please.

31:44.152 --> 31:46.371
I would be interested
in your opinion.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.978
You captured my likeness.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.521
You think so?

32:16.184 --> 32:17.686
I'm glad.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.530
I shall call it

32:20.689 --> 32:22.236
<i>Beautiful Lies.</i>

32:24.025 --> 32:26.778
You wish to get to Inverness?
Very well.

32:27.821 --> 32:31.371
I know that Dougal MacKenzie is
raising funds for the Jacobite cause.

32:31.533 --> 32:34.787
I merely lack the necessary proof
to take him into custody.

32:35.245 --> 32:37.373
You will furnish me with that proof.

32:37.747 --> 32:40.216
Jacobite cause?
I have no idea what...

32:40.292 --> 32:41.635
Do not stand there and pretend

32:41.710 --> 32:43.132
that you have lived
among the MacKenzies

32:43.211 --> 32:45.885
these past months
and not heard them voice support

32:46.006 --> 32:49.886
for that failure James
and his witless offspring Charles.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.804
Mr. MacKenzie
would have to be witless indeed

32:52.888 --> 32:54.982
to discuss treason
in front of an English woman.

32:55.056 --> 32:58.401
Unless that English woman
was sympathetic to his cause.

32:59.561 --> 33:00.733
I am not that woman.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.064
Then prove it.

33:02.689 --> 33:04.612
Have you seen any of
your Scottish companions

33:04.691 --> 33:06.318
attempting to raise funds
for the rebellion?

33:06.693 --> 33:07.740
No, I have not.

33:07.819 --> 33:11.540
You've not heard a single MacKenzie
speak Jacobite treason?

33:13.033 --> 33:15.035
How many times must I say it?

33:17.579 --> 33:19.502
I would not believe you

33:20.081 --> 33:23.335
if you told me that night is dark
and day is bright.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.175
Captain, am I under arrest?

33:26.087 --> 33:27.134
Because if not,

33:27.214 --> 33:30.388
then I refuse to submit
further to this interrogation.

33:30.592 --> 33:33.766
I will await Lord Thomas' return,
no matter how long it takes.

33:34.888 --> 33:36.561
I place my fate in his hands.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.438
If you wish to put me under guard
in the meantime,

33:38.517 --> 33:40.110
then I shall not protest.

33:47.734 --> 33:49.953
You will not leave this room
until I am satisfied

33:50.028 --> 33:51.951
that you are as innocent
as you claim to be.

33:53.615 --> 33:57.210
Either you can cooperate with me,
or I shall be forced

33:57.285 --> 34:00.255
to use methods
less pleasant than talk.

34:01.248 --> 34:03.467
I've heard about
your methods, Captain.

34:04.125 --> 34:06.719
What would you do,
lay my back open to the bone?

34:08.338 --> 34:10.636
I understand flogging is
something of a sport for you.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.592
On the contrary.

34:13.134 --> 34:14.306
I take it very seriously.

34:14.386 --> 34:15.888
I'm sure you'll be
pleased to learn that

34:15.971 --> 34:18.975
you've earned
quite the reputation at Castle Leoch.

34:21.016 --> 34:24.146
Yes, I'm told that you once
administered 100 lashes

34:24.228 --> 34:27.324
upon 100 lashes
to a poor Highlander boy.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.547
A poor Highlander boy?

34:47.585 --> 34:49.259
If I take your meaning,

34:49.337 --> 34:53.012
that boy is a wanted thief
and murderer.

34:54.009 --> 34:56.728
I was told he'd merely
stolen a loaf of bread.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.230
Did Dougal MacKenzie tell you that?

35:04.185 --> 35:05.357
He was there.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.197
<i>He witnessed it.</i>

35:08.648 --> 35:11.777
<i>The thief had been flogged before
for trying to escape.</i>

35:11.860 --> 35:14.329
<i>100 lashes administered
by the corporal,</i>

35:14.404 --> 35:18.955
<i>a man not without skill in
using the cat-o'-nine-tails,</i>

35:20.368 --> 35:21.711
<i>but the thief didn't break.</i>

35:22.954 --> 35:26.549
<i>No, he took his punishment
without making a single sound.</i>

35:28.543 --> 35:31.217
<i>It set a very bad example
for the assembled onlookers,</i>

35:31.338 --> 35:33.966
<i>both soldiers and civilians,
and I could not allow</i>

35:34.049 --> 35:36.802
<i>that insult to the crown
to pass unchecked,</i>

35:37.719 --> 35:39.062
<i>so yes.</i>

35:40.388 --> 35:44.859
<i>I decided that a further
100 lashes were in order.</i>

35:46.603 --> 35:47.900
Hurry up.

35:48.146 --> 35:51.741
<i>This time,
I would administer them myself</i>

36:12.462 --> 36:15.386
I prefer to work
on a blank canvas. It...

36:15.757 --> 36:17.851
It makes one more able
to mark the progress

36:17.926 --> 36:19.599
of the damage inflicted.

36:20.970 --> 36:22.222
You're shaking.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.104
Are you scared?

36:28.103 --> 36:31.448
I'm just afraid I'll freeze stiff
afore ye're done talking.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.531
I will break you.

36:58.341 --> 37:02.471
<i>Have you ever seen
a man scourged, madam?</i>

37:04.139 --> 37:05.857
<i>It's never pretty,</i>

37:07.851 --> 37:09.524
and the thought
of the whip coming down

37:09.602 --> 37:11.650
across that pitiful, raw flesh

37:14.941 --> 37:17.364
made my stomach flutter
and my legs shake.

37:30.373 --> 37:31.716
I did...

37:32.000 --> 37:34.173
I had intended

37:35.628 --> 37:37.175
to pace myself.

37:38.423 --> 37:42.348
100 lashes is fatiguing to the arm.

38:00.153 --> 38:04.875
<i>Again, the boy refused to cry out.</i>

38:07.202 --> 38:09.170
I wonder,

38:09.245 --> 38:11.714
did he hope to stir me to pity?

38:13.958 --> 38:15.460
If he did, he was sadly mistaken.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.045
I was...

38:19.047 --> 38:20.720
I was hurting him.

38:23.510 --> 38:24.887
I could feel it.

38:26.930 --> 38:32.027
The sheer judder of the whip
coursing up my arm,

38:32.101 --> 38:34.854
exploding into my heart.

38:37.482 --> 38:41.828
But the boy would not beg for mercy.

38:43.822 --> 38:44.948
The boy would not beg.

39:29.617 --> 39:32.120
Look at me. Look at me!

39:35.832 --> 39:38.551
Is that enough? Is that enough?

39:54.475 --> 39:56.978
<i>And then something changed.</i>

39:59.772 --> 40:02.571
<i>One of my men fainted like a woman,</i>

40:03.568 --> 40:06.321
<i>and the crowd barked in laughter.</i>

40:06.613 --> 40:08.160
Silence!

40:08.364 --> 40:10.913
<i>I mink it was
in that moment that I determined</i>

40:10.992 --> 40:12.710
<i>to bleed him to the bone.</i>

40:14.078 --> 40:18.549
<i>The world suddenly narrowed down
to my arm and his back,</i>

40:20.043 --> 40:22.762
<i>the whip connecting us both.</i>

40:23.880 --> 40:29.978
<i>The laughter changed, first to gasps,
then to sobs.</i>

40:34.682 --> 40:38.027
<i>The crowd, they had to look away.</i>

40:39.520 --> 40:41.193
<i>They were horrified.</i>

40:48.404 --> 40:50.247
Blind fools.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.873
I think all they could
see was the horror.

40:58.414 --> 41:02.044
I could see the beauty.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.559
I saw the truth.

41:12.679 --> 41:15.182
That boy and I...

41:18.601 --> 41:20.274
We were creating a masterpiece.

41:21.771 --> 41:27.699
<i>An exquisite, bloody masterpiece.</i>

41:37.620 --> 41:39.714
It was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

41:45.294 --> 41:48.719
The truth carries a weight
that no lie can counterfeit.

41:54.804 --> 41:58.183
I promised that I would reveal
myself to you, and...

42:01.894 --> 42:03.362
I have.

42:04.772 --> 42:06.490
Yes.

42:08.151 --> 42:09.824
I believe you have.

42:12.155 --> 42:14.157
You think me a monster, no doubt.

42:15.908 --> 42:17.376
It could be so.

42:27.795 --> 42:30.173
The fact that you care what I think

42:31.257 --> 42:33.931
gives me some hope yet for your soul.

42:37.764 --> 42:39.357
I know one thing, madam.

42:42.143 --> 42:44.145
I am not the man I once was.

42:46.397 --> 42:49.321
I came to Scotland to fulfill
a soldier's responsibility,

42:49.400 --> 42:52.654
to serve my King,
and protect my country.

42:53.905 --> 42:55.623
Instead...

42:57.700 --> 43:03.252
I find myself the watchman
of a squalid, ignorant people

43:03.331 --> 43:06.050
prone to the basest
superstition and violence.

43:08.628 --> 43:12.553
The darkness has grown within me.

43:13.966 --> 43:15.343
A hatred

43:16.260 --> 43:18.228
for the very world itself.

43:20.598 --> 43:23.067
I find myself doing such things,

43:26.354 --> 43:28.106
reddish work,

43:30.733 --> 43:33.612
until I no longer recognize
the man I have become.

43:40.743 --> 43:44.088
You're not the first soldier
to be changed by combat.

43:46.791 --> 43:49.135
The fact that you can admit to it is

43:49.919 --> 43:51.967
yet another hopeful sign.

43:54.465 --> 43:55.717
Of what?

43:58.636 --> 44:02.812
You say that buried within

44:03.349 --> 44:04.976
is a decent man,

44:06.144 --> 44:08.818
a man that can still
choose right over wrong.

44:12.150 --> 44:15.245
I believe that part of you
lives still.

44:18.906 --> 44:20.908
It would be pretty to think so.

44:26.372 --> 44:28.795
You cannot undo
the things you've done,

44:30.418 --> 44:33.092
but it is not too late
to win back your humanity.

44:34.088 --> 44:37.092
You can choose to be
the man you wish to be.

44:40.595 --> 44:44.316
Do you think it possible
that one day I might gaze

44:44.390 --> 44:47.610
upon my own reflection
and not be filled with loathing?

44:48.936 --> 44:50.609
I believe,

44:51.814 --> 44:56.035
a man with your insight
and self-knowledge

44:56.110 --> 44:57.953
can do whatever he wants.

45:01.115 --> 45:03.959
The rehabilitation
of Black Jack Randall.

45:06.454 --> 45:09.298
You could make a fortune
betting against that.

45:15.087 --> 45:19.638
Perhaps I should begin by having
you escorted to Inverness.

45:26.515 --> 45:28.233
I've made you happy.

45:31.145 --> 45:32.362
Yes, you have.

45:36.901 --> 45:38.824
An odd sensation.

45:42.198 --> 45:44.075
A beginning, perhaps.

45:47.453 --> 45:48.545
I agree.

45:53.793 --> 45:55.636
Corporal Hawkins.

45:58.673 --> 46:00.926
Mrs. Beauchamp and I...

46:02.718 --> 46:04.311
Require your assistance.

46:05.930 --> 46:08.183
Captain Randall,
you have my deepest...

46:19.860 --> 46:23.535
I dwell in darkness, madam,
and darkness is where I belong.

46:23.990 --> 46:27.039
I need no sympathy from you,
and you will get none from me.

46:28.661 --> 46:32.837
One way or the other,
I will get the truth out of you.

46:35.668 --> 46:37.136
Corporal...

46:40.381 --> 46:42.054
Have you ever kicked a woman?

46:43.050 --> 46:44.267
Sir?

46:46.262 --> 46:49.732
It's very freeing.

46:51.183 --> 46:52.560
Come.

47:00.234 --> 47:01.531
Kick her.

47:08.159 --> 47:10.662
I said kick her, milksop.

47:12.747 --> 47:14.420
Kick her!

47:21.464 --> 47:22.966
You see?

47:24.759 --> 47:28.935
They're so soft.

47:33.184 --> 47:34.606
Again.

47:41.067 --> 47:43.490
I don't recall
requesting your presence.

47:46.280 --> 47:47.907
Up ye come, lassie.

47:48.115 --> 47:49.662
Ye're done here.

47:50.868 --> 47:52.120
Hold!

47:55.873 --> 47:57.546
I dinna come here to fight.

47:57.708 --> 48:00.427
You tell yer wee laddies
here to step aside

48:00.503 --> 48:02.301
before I lose my temper.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.178
You have no right to that woman,

48:04.256 --> 48:06.805
not while she's being
questioned by a British officer.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.602
She is a guest of Clan MacKenzie.

48:08.719 --> 48:10.437
She is an English subject first.

48:10.513 --> 48:11.685
And she was brought here for fear

48:11.764 --> 48:13.641
she was being held
prisoner by my brother.

48:13.724 --> 48:15.726
Now she will have assured ye
that that is not the case,

48:15.810 --> 48:18.529
and by right, must be
returned to me for protection.

48:18.604 --> 48:20.356
I'm afraid further
questions have arisen.

48:20.898 --> 48:22.024
Well...

48:22.650 --> 48:24.994
Ye won't be asking them
on MacKenzie land.

48:25.653 --> 48:29.453
Not unless you want to start
a war here, on this day.

48:40.501 --> 48:42.674
I suppose we're done for the day.

48:42.878 --> 48:46.678
Be sure to deliver her to
Fort William by sundown tomorrow.

48:46.966 --> 48:49.765
If she is not present
at the appointed time,

48:49.844 --> 48:53.439
you will be accused of harboring
a fugitive from English law,

48:53.639 --> 48:55.641
and you'll be hunted down
and punished,

48:55.724 --> 48:57.146
even unto death.

48:57.935 --> 48:59.357
War chief or not.

49:03.107 --> 49:04.484
Let them pass.

49:05.693 --> 49:06.945
Come on, lass.

49:09.655 --> 49:12.659
I look forward
to our next meeting, Mrs. Beauchamp.

49:37.141 --> 49:39.439
<i>My body still
reeling from mistreatment,</i>

49:39.643 --> 49:42.021
<i>the last thing I felt like
was a headlong gallop</i>

49:42.104 --> 49:44.357
<i>through the rough terrain
of the Highlands.</i>

49:45.107 --> 49:48.862
<i>I feared I was close lo fainting when
Dougal finally called for a halt.</i>

49:49.570 --> 49:50.947
Are we meeting the others here?

49:51.030 --> 49:52.828
No, they're back at the campsite,

49:52.907 --> 49:56.081
but there's fresh water nearby,
and ye look like ye could use it.

49:56.368 --> 49:58.587
- Water? Where?
- Down.

50:13.344 --> 50:15.438
Bit of a climb for a drink,
is it not?

50:19.850 --> 50:21.022
Aye.

50:21.519 --> 50:22.862
There's a stink to it,

50:23.270 --> 50:25.147
but it will wet your thrapple
sure enough.

50:34.823 --> 50:38.703
Are ye a spy for the English
or the French?

50:40.287 --> 50:42.915
How many times must I answer
that same question?

50:43.290 --> 50:46.134
I promise, this is the last time
I'll ever ask it of ye.

50:48.379 --> 50:50.632
I am not a spy.

50:51.549 --> 50:53.802
I am plain Claire Beauchamp
and nothing more.

50:55.261 --> 50:56.478
There.

50:57.054 --> 50:58.522
Can we finally be done with it?

51:03.018 --> 51:04.315
Well?

51:06.730 --> 51:07.902
Aye.

51:08.649 --> 51:09.741
Done it is.

51:12.111 --> 51:14.113
Did you plan on using that on me?

51:14.613 --> 51:15.956
I would no have liked it.

51:16.031 --> 51:17.578
Ye're a handsome woman,

51:17.658 --> 51:20.127
but if you proved false,
I would have had no choice.

51:21.787 --> 51:24.711
But I ken now
ye're telling the truth.

51:26.166 --> 51:28.043
May I ask what convinced you?

51:29.003 --> 51:30.926
St. Ninian's spring.

51:31.005 --> 51:32.848
Some folk call it the liar's spring.

51:33.591 --> 51:35.593
Smells like the fumes of hell itself.

51:35.676 --> 51:38.850
If you drink from that
and you prove untrue,

51:39.221 --> 51:40.894
it'll burn your gizzard out.

51:44.393 --> 51:45.690
A magic spring?

51:45.978 --> 51:47.070
Well, you're a healer.

51:47.146 --> 51:49.023
Surely ye believe
in the powers of magic.

51:52.026 --> 51:54.870
Well, I doubt Captain Randall
would be so easily convinced.

51:56.238 --> 51:57.660
Aye.

51:57.906 --> 52:02.127
Well, ye don't need to see him again.

52:03.579 --> 52:05.252
Not if ye do what I tell ye.

52:07.416 --> 52:09.839
Don't you have to bring me
to Fort William tomorrow?

52:10.044 --> 52:12.888
An English officer
cannot compel a Scottish person,

52:12.963 --> 52:15.557
unless there is proof
a crime has been committed,

52:15.633 --> 52:18.182
and even so, cannot
force a Scottish subject

52:18.260 --> 52:20.558
from clan lands without permission

52:20.638 --> 52:22.140
from the laird concerned.

52:24.391 --> 52:25.984
You've been talking to Ned Gowan.

52:26.060 --> 52:27.607
Aye, I have.

52:28.312 --> 52:29.905
I thought it might come to this.

52:30.606 --> 52:34.236
I can only legally refuse
to hand ye back to Randall

52:34.318 --> 52:37.822
if I change ye from a Englishwoman

52:37.905 --> 52:39.407
to a Scot.

52:41.659 --> 52:42.785
Into a Scot?

52:42.910 --> 52:44.537
And the only way I can do that

52:44.828 --> 52:46.205
is for you to marry one.

52:47.956 --> 52:49.924
No. Absolutely not.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.297
I cannot do that!

52:51.377 --> 52:52.799
Would ye rather go
to an English prison?

52:56.298 --> 52:57.515
So I'm to marry you?

53:01.261 --> 53:03.184
Well, I must admit

53:03.263 --> 53:06.437
the idea of grinding your corn
does tickle me,

53:07.226 --> 53:10.150
but it's not myself
I'd be nominating for the position.

53:11.271 --> 53:12.523
Then who?

53:34.795 --> 53:36.638
Dougal wants us to be married.

53:36.714 --> 53:37.806
I know.

53:41.593 --> 53:43.266
And you're willing?

53:44.096 --> 53:47.817
Well, ye've mended my wounds
more than once.

53:49.768 --> 53:51.645
I feel I owe ye
something for all that.

53:52.271 --> 53:54.114
Besides, what kind of friend
would I be

53:54.189 --> 53:56.191
if I left ye to that
mad bastard Randall?

54:02.823 --> 54:05.246
But surely a young man
like yourself...

54:06.493 --> 54:09.838
Well, isn't there someone else
that you're interested in?

54:14.001 --> 54:15.378
Am I promised?

54:17.546 --> 54:18.763
No.

54:19.214 --> 54:21.433
No, I'm not much of
a prospect for a wife.

54:22.217 --> 54:25.016
I mean, I've nothing more
than a soldier's pay to live on.

54:25.220 --> 54:27.518
Then there's the minor difficulty
of a price on my head.

54:28.015 --> 54:29.642
No father wants his daughter
married to a man

54:29.725 --> 54:31.727
that might be arrested
and hanged any time.

54:32.603 --> 54:33.946
Did ye no think of that?

54:37.983 --> 54:39.326
So that's it then.

54:39.777 --> 54:42.872
As far as you're concerned, we can
just start the honeymoon tomorrow?

54:44.364 --> 54:45.536
Aye.

54:46.366 --> 54:47.709
Whatever suits you.

54:51.288 --> 54:53.211
Well, doesn't it bother you that...

54:56.210 --> 54:58.053
That I'm not a virgin?

55:03.383 --> 55:05.886
Well, no.

55:07.596 --> 55:10.975
So long as it doesna
bother you that I am.

55:16.480 --> 55:18.903
I reckon one of us should
ken what they're doing.

55:21.900 --> 55:29.900
