04:26.120 --> 04:29.329
Well, the only thing I know is she's
got a wedding ring, no husband.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.925
We gotta find out if
the husband's around.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.161
She have any family?

04:32.240 --> 04:33.366
According to these pictures

04:33.440 --> 04:34.487
over here on the
table, she does.

04:34.560 --> 04:35.766
Check with the building

04:35.840 --> 04:36.966
to see if they have any
surveillance tapes,

04:37.040 --> 04:38.610
find out if there
were any guests

04:38.680 --> 04:40.205
in the last 12 hours
that she might have had.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.327
You know, her other
slipper's up here. Yeah?

04:43.560 --> 04:44.686
Well, I'm just saying,
it's improbable

04:44.760 --> 04:47.411
that somebody would wanna walk
down the stairs with one slipper.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.881
Well, it's late at night, she
wants to go to the bathroom,

04:49.960 --> 04:53.009
she forgets her slipper.
She's disoriented, you know?

04:53.080 --> 04:55.401
There's only one point of
impact and it's severe enough

04:55.480 --> 04:59.087
that she fell from a 12-foot height,
not rolling down the stairs.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.685
You're right.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.683
What are you on, Twitter?

05:03.320 --> 05:04.446
Put the phone away.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.008
I mean, it's within the
realm of possibilities

05:08.080 --> 05:09.241
that she might have been thrown.

05:11.760 --> 05:12.761
Right?

05:12.960 --> 05:15.531
"Now that the apartment
across the hall is vacant."

05:15.600 --> 05:19.400
"I would like very much to discuss
purchasing it for myself."

05:19.480 --> 05:21.050
"I don't mean to take advantage"

05:21.120 --> 05:23.168
"of Mrs. Lonnigan's
passing so quickly,"

05:23.240 --> 05:26.164
"but one must admit that the
sweet darling had a good life,"

05:26.240 --> 05:29.722
"and in fact, lived longer than
most people would actually desire."

05:35.720 --> 05:37.245
NYPD. Open up.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.486
NYPD.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.364
"Please also take
into consideration"

05:52.440 --> 05:54.010
"that I first
declared my interest"

05:54.080 --> 05:57.084
"over two years ago after
she first fell ill."

05:57.840 --> 06:00.366
"I shall await your
earliest response."

06:00.440 --> 06:03.808
"Best, Abigail Clayton."

06:05.560 --> 06:07.210
So, can you tell me
about the tenants

06:07.280 --> 06:08.850
that live across the
hall from Mrs. Lonnigan?

06:08.920 --> 06:11.366
What are their names? Oh, yeah.
That's Abigail Clayton.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.326
Abigail Clayton.
Well, can you tell me about her?

06:15.720 --> 06:17.484
<i>Well,</i> not.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.844
Not really, sir.
I've actually never met her.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.247
You've never met her?

06:23.320 --> 06:24.606
No. I'm very sorry.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.570
Klandermann. Yes.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.687
Just a few more hours, actually,
is what I've been told.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.524
Can I get a coffee?
It's unavoidable, yes.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.728
We're so sorry for the... Yes.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.401
It is a disturbance. You're...

06:36.480 --> 06:38.130
Yup. Thank you.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.440
I'm sorry.
What were you asking me?

06:39.600 --> 06:42.046
You were saying that you've never
met the tenant who lives across...

06:42.120 --> 06:44.441
No. No, no, I haven't.
I've been here now...

06:44.520 --> 06:46.329
It's been 11 years. Oh, my.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.969
She was in the apartment before I
arrived, yes, so we've never met.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.520
In 11 years, you've never had any
interaction with her personally?

06:52.600 --> 06:53.965
That's not completely true, sir.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.122
<i>Every day or night
at a specific time</i>

06:56.200 --> 06:58.362
<i>she will pass a letter to
me underneath the door.</i>

06:58.440 --> 07:00.727
<i>I'm the only one in the building
who communicates with her.</i>

07:00.800 --> 07:03.087
<i>Food, clothing, you
name it, I deliver it.</i>

07:03.160 --> 07:05.561
<i>I</i> leave <i>It In the
hallway, I knock, I leave.</i>

07:05.640 --> 07:07.563
<i>She never goes out. Ever.</i>

07:08.040 --> 07:10.520
<i>Yeah, so, in that sense, we
have had communication, yes.</i>

07:12.280 --> 07:13.486
That's a little strange.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.891
Well, this is
Columbus Circle, sir.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.281
Nothing seems strange
around here.

07:18.960 --> 07:22.567
All right, I'm gonna have to ask
you to come into the station...

07:22.640 --> 07:24.608
Really? ...after you get off.
What time will that be?

07:24.680 --> 07:26.569
Is that absolutely...

07:26.640 --> 07:28.608
9:30. I get off at 9:30.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.407
Yeah, so...

07:31.480 --> 07:33.687
I'm gonna go try one more time.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.563
Miss Clayton?
Open up, please. It's NYPD.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.325
I know you're in there
Look, I tried to call, I.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.926
I just need two
minutes of your time.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.643
Fine.
We can do this one of two ways.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.848
You can let me in now and
I'll make it short and sweet

07:48.920 --> 07:51.400
or I'll come back later with a
warrant and a bunch of other guys.

07:51.480 --> 07:55.087
And from what I understand,
you won't like that too much.

07:55.480 --> 07:58.131
All right, fine,
I'll get awarrant.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.281
Creepy hallway.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.770
Hello? Oh, hey.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.724
Uh, Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.565
I just needed to talk to you
about your neighbor, if I may.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.327
I didn't know her.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.611
I'm sorry.
I'm very busy right now.

08:24.280 --> 08:27.329
Look, nobody...
I'm gonna come in here for a second.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.084
I'll shut the door. Uh...

08:29.680 --> 08:32.251
Look, nobody's in trouble.
I'm just following protocol.

08:32.320 --> 08:33.650
I just needed a few
minutes of your time.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.530
You live right across
the hall from her.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.726
Right.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.606
Wow, this is a really
beautiful apartment you have.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.361
Is that what they teach
you in detective school?

08:48.440 --> 08:52.081
Charm me with false praise and then
we're sitting down for coffee?

08:52.160 --> 08:55.721
Well, if you're offering, you know,
I'd love a cup of coffee. I...

08:55.800 --> 08:57.609
I got here at 6:00
in the morning.

08:57.680 --> 08:59.728
I came from another case,
I've been up all night.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.086
Coffee would be great.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.201
You cook?

09:08.400 --> 09:09.686
Yes.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.410
Are you expecting
somebody at this hour?

09:11.480 --> 09:14.006
I imagine that you already
know the answer to that one.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.885
Okay, you got me.
That was dishonest. I... Uh...

09:18.360 --> 09:19.691
I was just trying
to break the ice.

09:19.760 --> 09:23.560
Yeah, well, I'm not interested in
breaking ice or engaging in small talk,

09:23.640 --> 09:25.210
so I'd very much
like it if you would

09:25.280 --> 09:27.851
just get to the
point so that I can

09:27.920 --> 09:29.410
get on with my morning.

09:30.360 --> 09:31.725
So no coffee?

09:45.720 --> 09:47.006
How long have you lived here?

09:50.880 --> 09:53.326
You wanted to talk to
me about my neighbor?

09:53.400 --> 09:54.925
Thank you. Uh...

09:55.000 --> 09:56.490
Yeah, that's right.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.289
This is really nice.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.285
She was old

10:00.760 --> 10:03.570
and it's my understanding she
was sick for quite a while.

10:03.640 --> 10:04.846
I don't know.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.684
Well, from what I
put together, uh,

10:06.760 --> 10:08.888
she was feeling a lot better.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.721
You know, she liked to take the
stairs instead of the elevator.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.724
She preferred to walk
instead of taking a cab.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.521
Hmm. Well, if you say so.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.285
So, your concierge says that you
don't like to get out that much.

10:24.520 --> 10:25.885
I suppose so.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.046
Are you... Uh...

10:29.320 --> 10:30.810
What is that? Um...

10:31.160 --> 10:32.605
Agoraphobia?

10:32.680 --> 10:34.045
Well, if you insist.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.408
No, no offense.
You know, I suffer from arachnophobia.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.081
Really?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.161
Mmm-hmm.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.049
Yeah. That's a fear of spiders.

10:42.320 --> 10:46.166
Well, what I wouldn't do for a shoebox
full of tarantulas right now.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.051
You're pretty witty for a lady
that doesn't get out that much.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.726
Are you here to talk
about me or Hilary?

10:55.160 --> 10:56.161
Hilary?

10:57.640 --> 10:58.766
That was her name.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.206
But I thought you
didn't know her at all.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.770
No, Detective, I did not.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.360
So why would you call her by her first
name if you didn't know her at all?

11:04.440 --> 11:06.602
All right. Are we done yet?

11:08.960 --> 11:11.008
No. Just a few more minutes.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.487
Um, over the last couple
of days or weeks,

11:14.320 --> 11:16.209
were there any strange visitors

11:16.280 --> 11:18.123
or anything out of the ordinary

11:18.520 --> 11:21.729
that you were aware of
coming from the apartment?

11:23.760 --> 11:26.843
No strange sounds last
night when she died?

11:26.920 --> 11:29.969
Since I don't know when
she died, day or night,

11:30.040 --> 11:32.361
and since I've already
made it clear

11:32.440 --> 11:37.367
that I didn't hear anything out of the
ordinary coming from her apartment,

11:38.240 --> 11:41.323
then I'd venture to guess
that we are entering

11:42.200 --> 11:45.090
into an area of...
Hmm, redundancy?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.286
Okay, now we're done.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.170
Thank you for the coffee.
I'm gonna give you a couple of cards.

11:52.440 --> 11:56.490
If you think of
anything, uh, call me.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.684
Thank you.I will.

12:01.920 --> 12:02.921
Okay.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.729
Hey, this is a really nice vase.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.167
It's a little confusing,
but it's nice.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.322
I'm sure you could
figure it out.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.889
<i>Her name is Justine Waters,</i>

12:52.960 --> 12:55.201
<i>"and she was known as
“America's little darling. "</i>

12:55.320 --> 12:57.084
<i>The sole heiress of
the Waters fortune,</i>

12:57.160 --> 12:59.606
<i>estimated in the hundreds
of millions of dollars,</i>

13:00.120 --> 13:03.283
<i>she mysteriously disappeared
17 years ago this month.</i>

13:03.560 --> 13:05.164
<i>Take a look at these
home videos of Justine.</i>

13:05.240 --> 13:08.403
<i>They show her at the Waters family
summer cottage in upstate New York.</i>

13:08.480 --> 13:10.164
<i>As you can see, Justine
is being filmed</i>

13:10.240 --> 13:11.890
<i>showcasing her hula hoop skills.</i>

13:12.200 --> 13:15.329
<i>At the time, she held the world
record of 14 straight hours.</i>

13:15.560 --> 13:18.291
<i>Now, there's been much speculation
on Justine's whereabouts.</i>

13:18.360 --> 13:21.125
<i>Theories range from her running
off with a Saudi prince</i>

13:21.200 --> 13:23.009
<i>to her being a victim
of foul play.</i>

13:23.440 --> 13:25.488
<i>Now while the great and
powerful Phillip Waters</i>

13:25.560 --> 13:27.483
<i>claimed until his
death five years ago</i>

13:27.560 --> 13:29.449
<i>that he never stopped
looking for his daughter,</i>

13:30.360 --> 13:32.681
<i>Justine's 17-year silence</i>

13:32.760 --> 13:36.048
<i>remains the most talked about
missing persons mystery to date.</i>

13:36.680 --> 13:39.968
<i>In the days leading up to what would
become her historic vanishing act,</i>

13:40.280 --> 13:42.681
<i>it was rumored that
18-year-old Justine Waters</i>

13:42.760 --> 13:46.845
<i>had just become engaged to Prince
Achmed Mustafi of Jordan.</i>

13:47.200 --> 13:49.771
<i>What did happen to
Justine Waters?</i>

13:49.840 --> 13:51.842
<i>And will we ever see her again?</i>

13:51.920 --> 13:53.763
<i>I'm Jerry Penacoli for Extra.</i>

13:55.320 --> 13:58.290
I'm wondering if you
could help me identify

14:00.840 --> 14:02.080
this crest?

14:03.040 --> 14:04.963
Interesting. Yeah? Why is that?

14:05.040 --> 14:07.884
Well, this could
be a family crest.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.482
This is the letter "M," correct?

14:10.560 --> 14:13.006
Well, that was the intention.
The drawing is rough, but...

14:13.080 --> 14:15.048
Well, where'd you find this?

14:15.120 --> 14:18.329
I can't really tell you.
I just need to find out what it is.

14:18.840 --> 14:20.808
Okay. I got a book in the back,

14:20.880 --> 14:22.769
something of an
almanac, so to speak.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.410
Might be able to find a match.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.722
How long do you think...
Oh, one second.

14:26.800 --> 14:27.801
Yeah?

14:27.960 --> 14:29.689
Yeah, I went through all the
evidence like you asked.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.922
Hey, put it out. Step on it.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.365
Yeah, what do you got? Not <i>much.</i>

14:33.440 --> 14:34.646
The only thing that
might interest you

14:34.720 --> 14:35.881
are some prescription
medications,

14:35.960 --> 14:37.041
but she was an old woman.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.167
Well, do we know
who the doctor is?

14:38.240 --> 14:40.971
Yeah, some doctor in
Westchester County.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.485
<i>We got</i> a <i>name?</i>

14:43.360 --> 14:45.931
Yeah, a Dr. Raymond Fontaine.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.365
Okay, one second.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.330
Let me give you my card and I'll
just wait for your phone call.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.606
All right, Frank. Take it easy.

14:51.680 --> 14:52.841
All right, thanks, Howie.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.201
Well, the view is
definitely amazing.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.045
As you can see, we're directly
over Columbus Circle,

15:19.120 --> 15:21.964
which by the way, is the exact
point from which all distances

15:22.160 --> 15:24.686
to and from New York City
are officially measured.

15:24.760 --> 15:28.128
The owner completely renovated
and refurbished the entire unit

15:28.200 --> 15:30.771
with all the latest and
greatest amenities.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.161
Top-of-the-line
kitchen by Pedini.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.767
There's only two units
on the penthouse level.

15:35.840 --> 15:39.970
Twenty-four-hour doorman, concierge.
It's a full-service building.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.645
And we are getting another
offer later today, so...

15:43.720 --> 15:45.245
I think you guys
are the right fit.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.687
If I were you, I'd make a move.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.970
What do you think?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.804
I love it. Good.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.241
Mmm.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.883
They rented the apartment!

16:02.280 --> 16:03.566
How could this have happened?

16:03.760 --> 16:05.489
<i>I wrote half a dozen letters!</i>

16:05.560 --> 16:07.881
I agree, Abby, this
is simply outrageous.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.962
They haven't returned any
of my phone calls, either.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.042
Is there anything we
can do to stop this?

16:12.320 --> 16:14.129
I will look into it immediately.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.281
I need to see you, Ray.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.805
Abby, I'm busy.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.243
I said I need to see you, Ray.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.924
I'm in the middle of something.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.048
Raymond! Now!

16:26.320 --> 16:28.721
You know, the police were here.
In my home.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.042
Of course the police
were here, Abby.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.121
And that doesn't bother you?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.771
The police were here
because Hilary died.

16:34.840 --> 16:38.003
She had a fall and they're
investigating her death.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.924
You live across the hall, so of
course they're gonna inquire

16:41.000 --> 16:42.809
if you heard
anything suspicious.

16:42.880 --> 16:46.487
Once they deduce that her death was an
accident, which it most certainly was,

16:46.800 --> 16:49.770
they'll have no need to
bother you any further.

16:51.200 --> 16:54.409
One of the detectives
left me his card.

16:54.560 --> 16:55.607
Oh.

16:59.360 --> 17:02.170
Ray, how many wallets have I
bought you through the years?

17:02.240 --> 17:03.651
Abigail, I'm attached to this.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.609
It was a gift from your mother on
my first day of medical school.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.569
I'll never part with it.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.928
It's just that I don't
want things to change.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.207
Okay? I just need
things to stay the same

17:14.280 --> 17:16.248
I just need things to continue...
Abby, Abby.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.925
As they have been.
This is a disruption.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.163
Well, if change is
what you don't want,

17:22.440 --> 17:24.840
I strongly advise that
you stop inquiring

17:24.920 --> 17:26.843
about the apartment
across the hall.

17:27.119 --> 17:30.249
And it's sort of academic.
The apartment is leased.

17:30.680 --> 17:34.241
And they're gonna lead their
lives just as Hilary led hers.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.571
Not a peep...

17:37.760 --> 17:38.761
Ray.

17:38.840 --> 17:39.841
Abigail.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.848
You've gotta trust me, girl.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.369
You've gotta calm down.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.884
I promise you.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.724
Everything'll be fine.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.411
Haven't I always
been there for you?

17:59.080 --> 18:00.127
Hmm?

18:00.840 --> 18:04.287
And by "always," I mean for
the better part of your life.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.726
Okay, sweetie.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.521
Good morning, Mr. Stanford.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.601
Good morning.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.766
Mr. Stanford, if you
don't mind me saying so,

18:35.840 --> 18:38.491
I've got this sense that
I know you somehow.

18:39.560 --> 18:40.766
Really?

18:40.840 --> 18:41.966
Yeah. It's as if we...

18:43.160 --> 18:45.640
I don't know, we met
somewhere or something.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.409
I kinda get that a lot.

18:48.480 --> 18:49.720
I guess I just have
one of those faces.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.006
Oh, yeah?

18:51.080 --> 18:53.242
Well, that's probably it. Huh.

18:55.680 --> 18:58.286
Sure smells good coming out
of that loft of yours.

18:58.360 --> 18:59.930
I'm guessing Miss
Lillian's the...

19:00.000 --> 19:01.525
Yeah, she's the
chef in the family.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.601
Yeah.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.364
It's amazing I don't
weigh 300 pounds.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.249
I don't understand it.

19:27.680 --> 19:28.727
Son of a bitch!

19:28.800 --> 19:31.724
Well, it's a little too late for that!
You started it, Lillian!

19:32.040 --> 19:35.567
You son of a bitch! God damn it!
Why are you doing this?

19:36.600 --> 19:38.125
Jesus! Tell me one more time

19:38.200 --> 19:39.247
to keep my voice down,
I swear to God...

19:40.400 --> 19:41.606
I don't want the help to hear.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.806
Who gives a shit?

19:42.880 --> 19:44.723
I'm not gonna talk to you
when you're like this.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.451
I just wanna go inside, okay?
Charlie...

19:47.520 --> 19:48.601
You're not going
anywhere, bitch!

19:49.760 --> 19:50.921
Little slut!

19:51.000 --> 19:52.809
God damn it, I'm
going back inside.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.600
We're gonna finish this.

19:54.680 --> 19:55.966
Just shut up!

19:56.040 --> 19:57.280
Oh, you don't want
the help to hear!

19:57.520 --> 19:59.602
Well, I'm paying them
enough to plug their ears!

19:59.680 --> 20:02.411
God damn it. You're drunk!
I want to go back inside.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.968
You're not going anywhere.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.640
Bitch! Did you just hit me?
Is that what you did?

20:11.080 --> 20:12.411
You don't ever hit me!

20:12.560 --> 20:13.891
Bitch!

20:14.840 --> 20:16.080
I'm sorry!

20:16.160 --> 20:18.128
Don't ever hit Charlie!

20:18.760 --> 20:20.683
Do you understand that?

20:21.320 --> 20:23.163
Remember where you come from.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.089
Remember, you bitch!

22:35.000 --> 22:36.047
Miss?

22:41.440 --> 22:42.601
Help me.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.406
Please.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.605
Do I call 911?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.126
No.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.807
I don't want him to go to jail.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.887
You have to stand up. Stand up!

23:46.480 --> 23:47.845
Help me. Stand up!

24:04.880 --> 24:05.881
Shh.

24:15.840 --> 24:16.841
It's okay.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.081
Be quiet.

24:24.360 --> 24:25.600
Lillian. Shh.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.240
Just don't let him in.

24:27.320 --> 24:28.481
It's Charlie.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.286
I'm sorry.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.528
Please just open the door.

24:36.960 --> 24:39.691
Come on, I'm sorry.
Let's just talk about this

24:41.840 --> 24:43.046
Lillian!

24:43.760 --> 24:45.250
Shit. Please...

24:45.320 --> 24:46.765
Lillian, open the door.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.204
Open the fucking door!

25:11.080 --> 25:12.081
Oh, great.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.648
Mmm. Mmm.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.326
Thank you.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.721
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.211
What are you sorry for?

25:27.280 --> 25:30.443
I'm just sorry because
you're involved now in this.

25:31.880 --> 25:34.360
And I didn't mean
for this to happen.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.202
Well, you needn't be sorry.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.562
He works so hard and when he works,
he sometimes gets stressed

25:45.640 --> 25:48.803
and when he's under a lot of
pressure, he drinks a lot.

25:48.880 --> 25:52.407
And I think I set him off,
and I don't mean to.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.605
I feel so bad.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.802
Why are you making
excuses for him?

25:57.880 --> 26:00.963
'Cause you really don't know him.
He's a really, um...

26:05.160 --> 26:06.810
Reliable guy.

26:06.880 --> 26:08.609
Stop apologizing for him.

26:09.720 --> 26:10.767
Stop it.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.485
I do love him.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.161
Why would someone
kill a violinist?

26:33.240 --> 26:35.641
This job really sucks sometimes.

26:35.720 --> 26:39.008
Why would an 80-year-old woman
wanna jump off her balcony?

26:39.080 --> 26:42.289
See this here?
This is how I like my crime scene.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.727
That over there is
a torso, a head,

26:46.160 --> 26:47.491
and right down here...

26:47.560 --> 26:48.686
Oh, God.

26:48.760 --> 26:49.807
What the hell is that?

26:50.360 --> 26:52.249
You see, this is what a
murder scene looks like.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.880
What, so you don't think
this is a suicide as well?

26:57.400 --> 26:59.289
You, my friend, are
a sick bastard.

26:59.360 --> 27:00.407
I'm just saying,

27:00.480 --> 27:02.244
nine years on the job,
it just doesn't add up.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.324
What's interesting is the
girl across the hall.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.689
Oh, I see what this is about.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.091
What, she's hot?

27:09.160 --> 27:10.605
Yeah, she was attractive.
I knew it.

27:10.680 --> 27:11.841
No, here's the thing.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.002
- I ran her through the system, right?
- Please.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.447
There's nothing on her.
She doesn't have a social security number.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.284
She doesn't have a
driver's license, nothing.

27:18.960 --> 27:22.203
A woman like that, living in Columbus
Circle, with all that money?

27:22.280 --> 27:24.328
It just doesn't make sense.

27:24.840 --> 27:27.810
You know, she hasn't left
her apartment in years.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.724
This is New York City.
It's a town full of nuts.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.768
No, she didn't look crazy.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.130
How did she look?

27:36.240 --> 27:38.163
She looked like a victim.

28:24.440 --> 28:25.487
Mmm...

28:30.440 --> 28:31.771
Oh, my God.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.323
I can't believe I
fell asleep here.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.441
What time is it?

28:45.680 --> 28:47.284
It's almost 8:30.

28:47.720 --> 28:48.767
Oh, wow.

28:49.720 --> 28:52.371
Almost nine hours. Oh, my God.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.161
I'm sorry if I
invaded your space.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.045
It's all right.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.210
Would you like me to
pour you some tea?

29:02.280 --> 29:04.089
No, no, no, that's okay.
I just...

29:04.160 --> 29:06.766
I need to get going.
Thank you, though.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.568
Oh, God, Charlie's
gonna kill me.

29:09.720 --> 29:13.008
It looks like he already
tried to do that last night.

29:13.520 --> 29:14.601
Does it look bad?

29:17.920 --> 29:19.081
Do you have a mirror?

29:22.000 --> 29:23.570
It's right there.

29:32.760 --> 29:33.807
Oh...

29:50.400 --> 29:51.970
I feel so stupid.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.001
No.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.808
I do. I just feel so stupid.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.329
I don't even know you

30:02.920 --> 30:05.400
and here I am dragging
you into this.

30:06.880 --> 30:08.120
It's all right.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.247
God.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.530
It's all right. Don't. Don't.

30:19.240 --> 30:21.083
Why don't you sit down?

30:23.440 --> 30:25.283
I'll pour you some tea.

30:32.680 --> 30:33.966
Thank you.

30:35.080 --> 30:36.764
You've been so nice.

30:42.680 --> 30:43.727
I'm sorry.

30:45.880 --> 30:48.042
Charlie's not such a bad guy.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.845
I don't want you to hate him.

30:51.120 --> 30:53.122
Well, he made a terrible
first impression.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.281
I know.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.001
He did.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.290
Can I ask you a question?

31:09.320 --> 31:11.607
Why don't you like
having any visitors?

31:13.280 --> 31:15.760
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.446
That's what the real
estate agent said.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.642
Well, I guess I just decided a long
time ago that I'd rather be alone.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.609
That's not so strange.

31:28.840 --> 31:31.047
Sometimes I just wanna run away

31:33.360 --> 31:37.922
and be somewhere where nobody knows
me and I could just start over.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.401
I know.

31:49.120 --> 31:50.281
So what did you do?

31:50.400 --> 31:52.448
<i>I told you. He was coming back.</i>

31:52.800 --> 31:56.600
So I went out into the hallway
and I brought her in.

31:56.680 --> 31:59.001
The hall?
You went into the hall?

31:59.080 --> 32:01.082
<i>You know, she reminded me of...</i>

32:01.760 --> 32:04.366
Well, you know, you were there.
And...

32:04.880 --> 32:06.450
Well, I was...

32:07.520 --> 32:09.648
I was just a child then and,

32:11.880 --> 32:14.406
well, I wasn’t gonna
just stand there

32:14.960 --> 32:16.371
and watch this happen.

32:16.440 --> 32:18.124
So you called the
police, of course.

32:20.360 --> 32:21.361
No.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.241
What happened?

32:25.880 --> 32:27.405
Well, when she woke
up this morning...

32:27.480 --> 32:29.482
<i>"When she woke up”?
You mean she slept over?"</i>

32:29.680 --> 32:32.001
Well, it was hardly a
slumber party, Ray.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.889
She was injured

32:34.560 --> 32:36.050
and she passed out.

32:36.760 --> 32:37.807
What's her name?

32:40.200 --> 32:41.201
Lillian.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.570
<i>Is she still there?</i>

32:47.240 --> 32:48.241
No.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.046
She left.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.451
<i>She gonna be safe there?</i>

32:57.080 --> 32:58.206
I don't know.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.486
<i>Oh, Abby.</i>

33:00.200 --> 33:02.043
<i>What are you gonna do now?</i>

33:02.120 --> 33:05.408
<i>You know as well as anyone this
sort of thing only gets worse.</i>

33:05.480 --> 33:08.529
I don't know.
It's not my responsibility, right?

33:08.600 --> 33:10.523
Maybe you should consider that
now that you've helped her

33:10.600 --> 33:12.489
she'll likely come back
to you for help again.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.767
<i>Have you thought about what
you're gonna do next time?</i>

33:14.840 --> 33:15.841
No.

33:15.960 --> 33:16.961
Gimme a mini. Yeah.

33:17.040 --> 33:18.087
Schmear?

33:18.640 --> 33:21.007
I just know I don't
wanna be involved.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.241
<i>It's a little late for that.</i>

33:22.520 --> 33:26.081
And Abigail, it's unfair for you
to give her refuge and solace

33:26.160 --> 33:28.561
<i>and then when she comes
knocking again to ignore her.</i>

33:28.640 --> 33:31.928
<i>Maybe you could be proactive
and talk to her, help her.</i>

33:32.000 --> 33:33.490
I don't know.

33:33.560 --> 33:36.166
<i>Well, it's something to consider.
She's your neighbor.</i>

33:36.240 --> 33:37.526
<i>You have something in common.</i>

33:37.720 --> 33:39.802
Maybe you should have her for
dinner, over to your place.

33:39.880 --> 33:43.202
I don't think I'm entirely
comfortable with that idea, Ray.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.401
Think about it.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.481
All right.

33:47.160 --> 33:49.208
Are you eating? Yeah.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.089
Bagel with a schmear. Bye.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.728
You really banged me up.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.286
I'm sorry.

34:20.560 --> 34:21.846
<i>I mean it</i>

34:23.560 --> 34:24.891
I love you.

34:26.560 --> 34:27.925
I love you.

34:42.320 --> 34:43.650
Thank you, Bubba.

34:43.719 --> 34:45.210
You're welcome, Miss Hart.

34:47.239 --> 34:48.889
Miss Lillian, can I help
you with that, please?

34:49.400 --> 34:50.925
I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry!
Oh, wait.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.367
I've got it. No, don't, wait.

34:53.440 --> 34:55.726
You having fun down
there, Klandermann?

34:55.800 --> 34:58.087
No, sir. No, sir, not at all.
I was just trying to help with...

34:58.160 --> 34:59.207
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Let me help.

34:59.280 --> 35:00.281
Oh, good.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.124
This... I shouldn't see that.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.328
It's fine. Okay. All right.
I'll get the elevator.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.201
There we are.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.805
I'm so sorry.
I was trying to help.

35:09.880 --> 35:11.291
Don't worry about it.
There were just so many bags.

35:11.360 --> 35:12.486
I didn't realize... It's fine.

35:12.560 --> 35:15.370
It's not all for me.
I bought you a new tie.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.046
A new tie?

35:19.880 --> 35:21.609
A new tie? Yeah A new tie.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.127
Right here, sir?

35:25.640 --> 35:26.880
On the counter, please. Uh-huh.

35:27.120 --> 35:28.167
Excuse me, sorry.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.241
Thank you.

35:38.360 --> 35:39.805
Everything all right,
Klandermann?

35:39.880 --> 35:41.245
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

35:41.320 --> 35:42.526
Well, no.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.240
That's...

35:44.440 --> 35:45.487
That's where I found her.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.330
Found who?

35:48.400 --> 35:49.845
Mrs.
Lonnigan, the previous tenant.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.166
What do you mean?
Well, that's...

35:52.240 --> 35:54.402
I was the one that found her.
Right here.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.731
They said she fell
down the stairs.

35:59.520 --> 36:01.124
I didn't know that.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.884
She was such a sweet old
lady, too, you know?

36:02.960 --> 36:04.200
Everybody loved her
in the building.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.370
Always had something
sweet to say

36:06.440 --> 36:07.965
and always made everybody smile.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.565
The whole building
loved her, really.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.130
That's so sad.

36:11.200 --> 36:13.202
I'd just never seen
anybody die before.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.161
What do you mean?

36:16.400 --> 36:20.086
She wasn't dead yet
when I found her. No.

36:20.160 --> 36:23.130
We got a call, the tenant
down below, Henderson,

36:23.640 --> 36:24.971
they heard a real loud...

36:25.040 --> 36:27.850
And I raced to...
And the door was unlocked,

36:27.920 --> 36:32.209
which is quite unusual for a building
like this, I'll tell you that.

36:32.280 --> 36:35.443
But it seemed as if she
were still trying to speak.

36:36.200 --> 36:37.725
What was she trying to say?

36:37.800 --> 36:39.245
Oh, I have no idea.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.728
See, I'd never seen
anything and there she...

36:41.800 --> 36:45.441
It was awful, so it's all
kind of a blur now, you know.

36:46.440 --> 36:48.329
Yeah. Yeah, that's a shame.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.641
I mean, I have an idea
I shouldn't say that.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.609
I haven't told anybody this
before, but when I found her

36:52.680 --> 36:56.890
it sounded like she was
trying to say, uh, "Why?"

36:57.560 --> 36:58.721
"Why?"

36:58.800 --> 37:00.404
But it was a "Why me?"

37:00.480 --> 37:03.131
"Why did this happen to me?"
kind of "why." Does that make

37:05.360 --> 37:06.691
any, uh...

37:10.480 --> 37:12.289
I'm so sorry.
I should not be here.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.089
I'm so sorry to
take up your time.

37:14.160 --> 37:17.004
Do you need any help unloading
these bags at all or...

37:17.080 --> 37:18.650
I'll remember how I
know you, Mr. Stanford.

37:18.720 --> 37:20.245
I swear I will.
I'm so sorry I haven't.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.561
All right, let me
know when you do.

37:21.640 --> 37:22.641
Sure thing.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.524
What was that about?

37:28.160 --> 37:29.969
He thinks he knows me.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.165
Does he?

37:32.240 --> 37:33.321
I don't think so.

38:00.600 --> 38:01.601
Hi. Sorry.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.284
This, um... From...

38:04.400 --> 38:05.401
You're good?

38:06.200 --> 38:07.725
Thank you. Okay.

38:24.440 --> 38:27.887
Before you moved around, you were
just in Bakersfield that whole time?

38:27.960 --> 38:29.450
Bakersfield, California.

38:29.520 --> 38:33.320
My mom drank, mostly to
get away from my father,

38:33.760 --> 38:36.001
who also drank.

38:38.040 --> 38:39.041
Hmm.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.963
Was he abusive? Yeah.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.042
That's pretty much why I left,

38:43.880 --> 38:46.565
because I couldn't take it any more.
I was 15

38:47.760 --> 38:50.525
and I had $7.20 to my name.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.762
And I had fallen in
love with Charlie

38:54.680 --> 38:57.843
and he's pretty much
just taken care of me.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.484
I couldn't...

39:00.560 --> 39:02.608
I couldn't stay with
someone who hurt me.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.809
I mean, we have a good time,
but I don't really...

39:07.080 --> 39:09.890
I wouldn't really have
anything without him

39:12.240 --> 39:13.651
I just couldn't do it.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.684
So what's the alternative?

39:20.480 --> 39:21.561
Would you like some more wine?

39:21.640 --> 39:23.290
Yes, please.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.930
So where's your family?

39:30.000 --> 39:31.331
My mom died.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.046
And your father?

39:34.760 --> 39:36.250
He's dead, too.

39:36.360 --> 39:37.407
Oh.

39:37.520 --> 39:39.443
Were you close with them?

39:40.480 --> 39:42.005
I was close with my mother.

39:42.640 --> 39:43.721
Mmm-hmm.

39:44.080 --> 39:45.286
My dad...

39:45.360 --> 39:47.249
My dad drank as well

39:47.320 --> 39:50.483
and he'd fly off the handle.
He'd go into these rages.

39:52.160 --> 39:54.049
And he would beat
my mother and me

39:55.280 --> 39:56.566
when I tried to protect her.

39:58.480 --> 39:59.606
Mmm-hmm.

40:01.680 --> 40:02.681
Hmm.

40:02.760 --> 40:05.047
My father could
control anything.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.644
So you grew up rich?

40:18.160 --> 40:19.366
I suppose.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.522
Well, I grew up in
the trailer park.

40:24.680 --> 40:25.886
Lucky me.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.204
Do you have any
brothers or sisters?

40:29.280 --> 40:30.327
Nope.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.127
Just me.

40:32.800 --> 40:34.609
You? No. Just me, too.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.451
So how'd you disappear?

40:40.160 --> 40:41.844
Haven't I always
been there for you?

40:42.240 --> 40:43.287
My father had a friend.

40:43.360 --> 40:46.443
My father had a friend and he
knew how bad my father could be

40:46.520 --> 40:49.729
and what he was capable
of, so he helped me to...

40:49.800 --> 40:50.881
He helped me.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.490
You know, I didn't
intentionally...

40:53.560 --> 40:55.085
I didn't set out intentionally.

40:55.160 --> 40:59.484
To not go out again. I just...

41:00.160 --> 41:02.640
You know, I went to
the grocery store

41:03.120 --> 41:05.566
<i>and I'd sneak out at night,</i>

41:07.080 --> 41:08.366
go to Central Park.

41:09.400 --> 41:13.246
<i>I was always amazed at how
quiet everything was.</i>

41:13.800 --> 41:15.689
Such a big city.

41:17.440 --> 41:18.965
I wanna take you outside.

41:20.040 --> 41:22.486
There's this flower shop.
It's a block away.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.084
I wanna take you there.

41:25.160 --> 41:26.650
It smells so incredible

41:27.640 --> 41:29.688
and I wanna pick out
your favorite flowers.

41:29.960 --> 41:33.169
And then a block further
is this rare bookstore

41:33.240 --> 41:37.086
that smells kind of musky and it
has the most incredible books,

41:37.160 --> 41:39.970
and there's this window seating
and we can pick out some books

41:40.040 --> 41:41.804
and read together.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.649
I don't think I'd feel safe.

41:45.080 --> 41:46.286
I would be with you,

41:46.880 --> 41:48.120
protecting you.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.931
You can't stay in here for the
rest of your life. Look at you.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.924
You're so beautiful.

41:57.400 --> 41:58.447
<i>You're stunning.</i>

41:59.840 --> 42:01.569
I wanna take you out
into the world.

42:14.400 --> 42:16.209
You smell his lavender?

42:17.360 --> 42:19.727
Let's see if he's
in the backyard.

42:20.840 --> 42:23.844
This is a nice house.
I should've been a doctor.

42:24.360 --> 42:25.361
Hello?

42:28.000 --> 42:29.525
You smell paint?

42:31.560 --> 42:34.211
Oh, for Christ's sake.

42:34.280 --> 42:37.011
My good shoes.
My mom's gonna have a fit.

42:37.320 --> 42:39.243
I just painted that porch.

42:39.480 --> 42:42.051
I'm so sorry.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.608
We had no idea.

42:45.880 --> 42:48.884
I'm so sorry.
You must be Dr. Ray Fontaine?

42:49.080 --> 42:50.206
Yes.

42:50.280 --> 42:51.805
Yeah, I'm Detective
Frank Giardello.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.086
This is my partner, Jerry Eaans.

42:53.160 --> 42:56.130
Two detectives and you couldn't figure
out the porch was freshly painted?

42:56.600 --> 42:58.364
We're really sorry.

42:58.440 --> 43:01.410
We were wondering if we could
have a few minutes of your time.

43:01.480 --> 43:04.131
Sure. Would it be all right
if we spoke out here? Uh...

43:04.200 --> 43:05.850
Oh, yeah. That would be fine.

43:06.280 --> 43:09.648
Yeah, we wanted to talk to you
about Mrs. Hilary Lonnigan.

43:09.880 --> 43:11.405
Sure. What about her?

43:11.480 --> 43:13.164
Well, I'm sure that you're aware

43:13.240 --> 43:14.844
that she passed away a
couple of weeks ago.

43:15.040 --> 43:16.804
Of course. I was her doctor.

43:16.880 --> 43:19.167
Yeah. Could you tell
us about her health?

43:19.240 --> 43:21.242
She'd been ill for awhile.

43:21.320 --> 43:23.607
Oh, yeah, she was ill.
With what?

43:24.040 --> 43:25.166
Cancer. Mmm.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.403
It was in remission, actually.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.323
Any dizzy spells,
anything like that?

43:29.400 --> 43:32.882
She never complained of any.
She did have tendencies to push herself.

43:32.960 --> 43:36.123
She was one of those people who
didn't like standing still.

43:37.120 --> 43:38.201
Why?

43:38.280 --> 43:40.044
Well, she was pretty
badly injured.

43:40.720 --> 43:43.246
Well, she did fall down
the staircase. Yeah.

43:44.600 --> 43:45.681
What are you suggesting?

43:45.840 --> 43:47.410
Oh, no, no.
We're not suggesting anything.

43:47.480 --> 43:49.642
We're just trying to
find out whether or not

43:49.720 --> 43:51.802
we have a homicide on our hands.

43:51.880 --> 43:54.201
We'd like to see her medical
records, if that's all right.

43:54.280 --> 43:56.362
Of course. I'd need a subpoena.

43:56.440 --> 43:58.363
- Doctor-patient confidentiality.
- Of course.

43:58.440 --> 44:00.761
Why don't we do this?
Why don't I give you one of my cards...

44:00.840 --> 44:02.763
Thank you. All right.
...and we'll be in touch.

44:02.840 --> 44:04.604
It was a pleasure to meet you.
Yeah, it's good to meet you.

44:04.680 --> 44:06.250
What's your dog's name?
Oh, this is Digger.

44:06.320 --> 44:07.481
Digger? Yeah.

44:07.880 --> 44:08.961
All right. Thanks.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.041
All right.

44:10.120 --> 44:11.326
Oh! By the way,

44:11.840 --> 44:13.205
do you know Abigail Clayton?

44:13.800 --> 44:16.690
Uh, again, Officer,
doctor-patient confidentiality.

44:17.320 --> 44:18.367
Oh. Yeah.

44:18.440 --> 44:20.249
We don't want to take up any
more of your time. Thank you.

44:20.320 --> 44:21.890
Thank you.
You gentlemen have a good evening.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.166
You, too.

44:23.400 --> 44:24.686
Stop that.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.126
What?

44:38.200 --> 44:40.362
Well, I didn't ask him
if she was a patient.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.442
I asked him if he knew her.

44:50.920 --> 44:52.843
You're doing good.
You're doing great.

44:53.960 --> 44:55.041
Good.

44:55.120 --> 44:57.168
Amazing, Abigail. Abigail...

44:58.120 --> 45:00.771
Lillian, why are we even doing this?
I don't want to leave.

45:00.840 --> 45:03.366
We're doing this because it's
good to get out of the apartment.

45:03.880 --> 45:06.167
You're doing beautifully.
Look at you.

45:06.240 --> 45:07.730
That's enough, Lillian...
No, no, no.

45:08.880 --> 45:10.245
Okay, okay.

45:12.560 --> 45:13.686
Great. You're doing great.

45:16.200 --> 45:17.281
I don't feel well.

45:17.360 --> 45:18.407
It's okay. I know.

45:18.480 --> 45:19.845
This is far enough.

45:21.560 --> 45:23.881
You're doing great. I'm here for you.
I'm here for you.

45:24.440 --> 45:26.124
Abigail.

45:34.280 --> 45:35.281
Hold the door.

45:35.360 --> 45:36.805
Oh! I got it, sir.

45:37.480 --> 45:40.051
I got it. Come on in.
There you go.

45:40.520 --> 45:42.966
We're gonna at least walk
to that table over there.

45:43.040 --> 45:45.361
No, I think we've
gone far enough.

45:46.480 --> 45:48.926
Everything all right tonight?
Sir?

45:49.080 --> 45:50.161
Uh-huh.

45:52.640 --> 45:53.880
Good. I'm not ready yet.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.849
O kay? O kay- Okay.

45:56.960 --> 45:57.961
Okay

46:07.320 --> 46:09.004
I just remembered where
I know you from.

46:10.600 --> 46:11.681
Yeah.

46:14.840 --> 46:16.968
One, two,

46:18.440 --> 46:19.566
three.

46:21.480 --> 46:24.802
Come on! There you go! Good!
Great job! Great job!

46:27.520 --> 46:28.806
Beautiful.

46:31.360 --> 46:32.600
Oh, God.

46:45.520 --> 46:47.249
You must be Abigail.

46:48.040 --> 46:50.407
You feeling all
right, sweetheart?

46:52.200 --> 46:53.804
Here, let me help.

46:55.720 --> 46:57.882
Huh? Don't touch her!
Don't touch her, please!

46:57.960 --> 46:59.325
Just don't.

46:59.400 --> 47:01.004
Okay? Okay?

47:01.560 --> 47:03.130
Don't, don't. Please don't.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.486
Charlie, please.

47:17.480 --> 47:19.482
You ladies have a good night.

47:19.560 --> 47:21.642
Just stay here for a second.

47:24.320 --> 47:25.765
No, no!

47:25.840 --> 47:27.808
Please don't go in there!

47:27.880 --> 47:29.291
Please don't!
Charlie, what are you doing?

47:30.680 --> 47:33.160
I don't want him to
be in my apartment.

47:33.360 --> 47:35.328
Stay right here. He's violent!
He's in my apartment.

47:35.400 --> 47:36.970
Abigail!

47:49.400 --> 47:51.164
When you get her out
of her apartment,

47:51.240 --> 47:54.687
I install some computer software
so that when she goes online,

47:54.760 --> 47:56.489
we'll be able to get
her banking password.

47:56.560 --> 47:58.050
Right. Got it. Got it?

47:58.400 --> 48:00.209
<i>It's like stealing the
identity of a ghost.</i>

48:00.320 --> 48:02.721
<i>Exactly.
She wants to remain hidden.</i>

48:03.160 --> 48:06.164
<i>And after we've got the money, who
the hell is she gonna run to?</i>

48:06.720 --> 48:10.088
<i>We've got her account information,
her social security number,</i>

48:10.160 --> 48:13.164
<i>her signature, but we still
need to get your fake ID.</i>

48:13.240 --> 48:15.481
<i>It's just so perfect.</i>

48:15.960 --> 48:19.123
<i>We're talking about hundreds
of millions of dollars.</i>

48:19.200 --> 48:20.884
<i>No more nickel and dime shit.</i>

48:20.960 --> 48:23.042
<i>Just sunsets and mimosas, baby.</i>

48:23.480 --> 48:25.005
<i>And once we get the password</i>

48:25.680 --> 48:27.409
we're home free.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.490
Happy birthday.

48:30.560 --> 48:32.244
Thank you. I love you, baby.

48:32.320 --> 48:33.321
I love you.

48:35.600 --> 48:36.931
Abigail, please!

48:37.000 --> 48:38.604
What is he doing
in my apartment?

48:41.320 --> 48:43.209
He's been drinking! Abigail!
He's been drinking.

48:43.440 --> 48:45.886
You can't, no.
He gets really violent.

48:45.960 --> 48:46.961
You don't want him to hit you.

48:47.040 --> 48:48.087
You don't want him to hit you.

48:48.760 --> 48:51.081
You know what it feels like.
Stay here.

48:56.920 --> 48:59.810
Hey! That's not my apartment.

49:04.640 --> 49:07.120
I'm right here.
I'm right here. Abigail.

49:07.640 --> 49:09.165
I wanna go home.

49:10.280 --> 49:12.965
I live in here and
this is how I want it.

49:13.040 --> 49:15.964
I want to be alone.
This is how I want it.

49:16.040 --> 49:18.520
You did a great job
tonight, Abby.

49:19.400 --> 49:21.641
I cannot have people in my life.

49:21.720 --> 49:22.846
I cannot have people in my life.

49:22.920 --> 49:25.048
I cannot have you in my life.

49:25.800 --> 49:28.121
If he is in your
life, I can't...

49:28.200 --> 49:30.885
No, I wanna be alone I wanna be alone.
I wanna be alone.

49:30.960 --> 49:32.041
Okay.

49:32.840 --> 49:33.921
Okay.

49:36.120 --> 49:37.610
I'm really sorry about Charlie.

49:37.680 --> 49:39.250
Stop apologizing.

49:40.200 --> 49:41.361
He's...

49:42.280 --> 49:44.601
He is dangerous and
he will only end up

49:44.680 --> 49:46.921
hurting you more
than he already has.

49:51.720 --> 49:53.006
Please go.

49:54.840 --> 49:55.887
Okay.

49:59.480 --> 50:00.766
Please go.

50:06.280 --> 50:09.250
Thank you so much for
dinner tonight, Abigail.

50:23.160 --> 50:27.449
ANSWERING MACHINE First <i>new</i> message.

It's Joe Klandermann.</i>

50:30.520 --> 50:33.524
<i>I guess now I should call you
Charlie since we go back, huh?</i>

50:33.600 --> 50:36.046
<i>Anyway, if you're having
trouble remembering me,</i>

50:36.120 --> 50:38.521

to a holding cell.</i>

50:38.600 --> 50:40.648

50:40.720 --> 50:42.848
<i>You were about to do a

50:45.480 --> 50:47.164
<i>Good times. Yeah.</i>

50:47.240 --> 50:48.571
<i>Enough reminiscing.</i>

50:48.640 --> 50:51.723
<i>Meet me at the coffee shop around
the corner on 59th Street</i>

50:51.800 --> 50:53.165

50:55.400 --> 50:58.483
<i>You're gonna cut me in on whatever
scam you're running, Charlie.</i>

50:58.560 --> 51:00.050
<i>I don't know what
it is, of course,</i>

51:00.120 --> 51:02.646

it's gotta be big.</i>

51:02.720 --> 51:04.768
<i>Yeah. Don't make me wait,</i>

<i>partner.</i>

51:07.400 --> 51:08.606
Damn it.

51:33.360 --> 51:34.725
You're crazy attacking me!

51:38.600 --> 51:41.365
You're a dead man! You hear me?
You're a dead...

51:47.720 --> 51:50.121
<i>Tonight's top story
is the bizarre death</i>

51:50.200 --> 51:52.521
<i>of a wanted felon on
Columbus Circle.</i>

51:53.040 --> 51:55.850
<i>We go now live to Diane
Weiss, who's on the scene.</i>

51:55.920 --> 52:00.323
<i>Apparently, Diane, the man was
strangled before being hit by a bus?</i>

52:00.600 --> 52:02.967
<i>Yes, Ginger.
Police believe the victim</i>

52:03.040 --> 52:05.361
<i>may have been fleeing
from an attacker.</i>

52:05.760 --> 52:08.570
<i>However, the victim,
Joseph Klandermann,</i>

52:08.880 --> 52:12.566
<i>whose real name was Nathaniel
Muskit, was a wanted felon.</i>

52:13.040 --> 52:14.201
Charlie?

52:14.280 --> 52:16.408
<i>Muskit disappeared
nearly 12 years ago</i>

52:16.480 --> 52:17.845
<i>and had eluded authorities
for that long.</i>

52:17.920 --> 52:19.001
Charlie?

52:19.080 --> 52:21.481
<i>He was convicted in
1998 for running</i>

52:21.560 --> 52:23.927
<i>a Ponzi scheme that
bilked investors...</i>

52:24.000 --> 52:26.401
You killed Klandermann? Charlie?

52:27.640 --> 52:29.085
Charlie, we don't kill people!

52:29.160 --> 52:31.242
Lillian. No, Charlie.

52:31.320 --> 52:32.685
This is the one.

52:32.760 --> 52:34.649
This is the one we've been
waiting for, Charlie!

52:34.720 --> 52:37.724
He could have turned us in.
I made a decision to protect us.

52:37.800 --> 52:40.246
You made a stupid
decision, Charlie.

52:40.320 --> 52:42.766
I don't wanna run from the cops!

52:43.040 --> 52:45.361
You don't have to be scared.
Okay?

52:46.120 --> 52:47.531
It's gonna be fine.

52:52.280 --> 52:53.566
It's okay.

52:59.480 --> 53:01.130
What does that say?

53:04.240 --> 53:06.208
He wants to see us. Yeah.

53:11.800 --> 53:13.450
Klandermann's dead, Ray.
He's dead.

53:13.560 --> 53:16.040
<i>I know, I heard.
Are you all right?</i>

53:16.120 --> 53:18.122
I don't know. I don't know.

53:18.400 --> 53:19.447
What am I gonna do?

53:19.520 --> 53:21.648
They will get a new concierge.

53:21.720 --> 53:23.927
Ray, you know I can't
trust a new concierge.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.650
I can't trust a new concierge.

53:25.720 --> 53:27.768
Klandermann had
been here so long.

53:27.840 --> 53:30.650
How am I gonna trust a
new concierge, Ray?

53:30.720 --> 53:31.881
Ray, I need to see you.

53:31.960 --> 53:34.406
I can't right now.
I promise I'll come by later.

53:34.560 --> 53:36.403
Please, Ray?
I really need to see you.

53:36.480 --> 53:39.404
<i>I'll see you later tonight.
You just relax.</i>

53:39.920 --> 53:42.400
Take a long breath now.
For me, okay?

53:44.280 --> 53:45.327
Bye.

53:51.960 --> 53:54.566
This has gotten
completely out of hand.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.001
I understand.

53:56.080 --> 53:57.320
No, I don't think you do.

53:57.400 --> 53:58.731
It's all over the television.

53:58.920 --> 54:01.526
I mean, Mrs. Lonnigan was one thing.
That had to be done.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.602
And so did Klandermann. Charlie?

54:03.680 --> 54:06.081
But there was a mistake
made with Mrs. Lonnigan.

54:07.200 --> 54:09.123
What are you talking about?
What is he talking about?

54:09.200 --> 54:10.645
When were you gonna
tell me this, Charlie?

54:10.720 --> 54:12.404
This is not the time
or the place for this.

54:12.480 --> 54:13.766
Ray, what do you mean "mistake"?

54:13.840 --> 54:16.241
There was obviously a
serious error made.

54:16.320 --> 54:18.846
We wanted to talk to you about,
uh, Mrs. Hilary Lonnigan.

54:18.920 --> 54:22.129
The police were here,
investigating a homicide,

54:22.200 --> 54:24.806
not a slip and fall of
an 82-year-old woman.

54:25.760 --> 54:27.125
I don't make mistakes.

54:27.200 --> 54:28.486
Oh, apparently, you do.

54:29.280 --> 54:32.170
Otherwise they wouldn't be
investigating a homicide, Charles.

54:32.480 --> 54:33.606
Jesus Christ.

54:33.680 --> 54:38.607
Now thanks to me, Mrs. Lonnigan
lived a long and prosperous life,

54:39.920 --> 54:42.321
three years longer
than I anticipated,

54:42.400 --> 54:44.971
and there's only a certain
amount of time one can wait.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.405
But this is over now.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.687
We need to discuss
an exit strategy.

54:49.760 --> 54:51.888
No, there is no exit strategy.

54:52.160 --> 54:54.242
We're one e-mail
away from a fortune.

54:54.320 --> 54:57.688
Charles, how long do you think it's
gonna take for them to figure out

54:57.760 --> 54:59.489
I'm the one who
owns the apartment?

54:59.560 --> 55:01.244
That I paid for the whole thing?

55:01.320 --> 55:02.765
It's my money!

55:05.440 --> 55:07.488
For them to put together
who Abigail is.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.286
And what we're all up to.

55:11.120 --> 55:15.091
We need to discuss
an exit strategy.

55:20.960 --> 55:22.883
He may be right, Lillian.

55:25.280 --> 55:26.486
It's just a shame.

55:26.720 --> 55:29.883
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm
gonna go water my plants,

55:29.960 --> 55:33.646
get over to Abigail's, take out
her trash, pick up her cleaning,

55:33.720 --> 55:36.929
and give her a foot
massage to calm her down,

55:37.000 --> 55:38.240
thanks to you.

55:44.840 --> 55:48.811
I guess I'm doomed to take care of
this woman the rest of my life.

56:00.720 --> 56:02.165
What do we do?

56:05.880 --> 56:07.120
Let me try to talk to him

57:41.480 --> 57:42.641
Lillian.

57:45.400 --> 57:48.961
Please go in the house and make
it look like it was robbed.

57:49.960 --> 57:51.041
Okay?

58:16.280 --> 58:17.327
Did you roll the body?

58:17.400 --> 58:18.401
Yeah.

58:19.080 --> 58:20.889
Did you get the phone?

58:27.960 --> 58:29.803
It wasn't in the house?

58:31.520 --> 58:32.521
No.

58:47.600 --> 58:49.602
It has all our information.

58:49.960 --> 58:51.121
I know.

58:57.120 --> 58:58.451
Do we walk?

59:01.360 --> 59:02.361
No.

59:02.760 --> 59:05.001
No. We don't walk.

59:05.920 --> 59:07.445
We're too close.

59:08.560 --> 59:11.006
With no money, how
far would we get?

59:13.800 --> 59:15.928
Look, we knew that
if things went wrong

59:16.000 --> 59:18.606
we'd have a backup
plan, and we do.

59:19.720 --> 59:20.767
Okay?

59:21.360 --> 59:23.328
We have to force her hand.

59:24.960 --> 59:26.041
Okay?

59:27.560 --> 59:29.324
We have to do it now.

59:31.240 --> 59:32.890
It's gonna be okay.

59:42.760 --> 59:44.922
Please! Please, I need you!
Open up! Hurry, please!

59:45.240 --> 59:48.050
Please! Open up! Let me in!
Open the door and let me in!

59:50.040 --> 59:52.486
He's gonna kill me, Abigail!
Please!

59:53.800 --> 59:55.962
Please, Abigail!
Open the door, please!

59:56.040 --> 59:57.963
Please, Abigail! Please!

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.567
Open the door! Open the door!

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.051
Oh, my God! Charlie, calm down!
Calm down!

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.884
Think you're gonna leave me?
No, I'm not, I swear!

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.166
Huh? You gonna leave me?

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.321
I'm not gonna leave you, Charlie!
Please!

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.847
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Okay?

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.888
No, no, no. No! Don't you...

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.131
Bitch! Get back here!

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.370
Gimme the gun!

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.685
Gimme the gun!

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.287
The gun! Gimme the gun!

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.323
I'm gonna shoot you, Charlie!
I'm gonna shoot you!

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.447
You're gonna shoot me?

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.521
I'll shoot you, Charlie!

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.840
Do it!

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:45.960
Charlie.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:57.407
Stop! Oh, my God! Stop!
No! What are you doing?

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.608
Stop! Oh, my God! No!

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.725
No! Get off him.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.280
Oh, my God! What are you doing?

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.601
What are you doing? Charlie!

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.402
Charlie, no! Charlie, no!

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:14.250
Charlie, wake up!
Wake up, Charlie, my baby.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.090
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.969
Charlie, wake up!
Wake up, Charlie!

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.249
You killed him, Abigail!
What have you done? What have you done?

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.767
No! I didn't do it. No, you did.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.081
You shot him!

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.002
I have to call someone.
Charlie, don't leave me.

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.285
Abigail, no, you can't call anybody!
Are you crazy?

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.931
Nobody can know about this.
No, Abigail!

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.043
We just murdered Charlie.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.648
We have to leave.
We have to get out of here.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.802
No, no, I can't go anywhere!

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.047
We're one e-mail
away from a fortune.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.207
I'm all alone and I don't know
what to do now and I need to go.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.290
Please, Abigail, help me.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.163
We need to scrape whatever
money we can together

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.245
and I need to get out of here.
Okay?

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.611
I have money.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.209
I don't have any cash.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.410
We can transfer

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.245
money from my account.

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.649
And once we get the
password we're home free.

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.366
I wish I could talk to Ray.

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:15.046
No, you can't talk to Ray.
You can't talk to anybody.

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.085
I trust him.

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.131
Look at me.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.367
We can only trust
each other now.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.367
Okay?

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.727
Mmm-hmm.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.047
Okay.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.008
Really? Are you kidding me?

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.370
You're positive?

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.481
Same guy?

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.370
So what'd you find out?

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:55.728
Well, I don't think that this is
an "M" you brought me, Detective.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.847
What do you mean?

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.251
<i>L</i> think it'; a.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.166
And if it is, it
could very well be

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.641
the crest for the Waters family.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.165
Are you familiar with
the Waters family?

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.605
Yeah, of course, of course.
Yeah.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:09.001
This is incredibly exciting.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.127
Is there any chance that you could
tell me exactly where you saw this?

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.248
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.202
I just found out Mrs.
Lonnigan's apartment

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.805
was paid for by a corporation.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.201
Apparently, she was a nanny
for some rich family.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.566
Guess who runs the corporation?

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.601
Who?

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.727
Dr. Raymond Fontaine.

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:30.564
Really? Let's go pay the good doctor a visit.
Thanks, Howie.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.641
Anytime, Frank.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.651
The porch was repainted.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.646
Anything?

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:30.641
No.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.971
Dr. Fontaine?

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.286
Hello?

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:53.766
NYPD.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.607
I'll go this way.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.486
Frank.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.610
Check this out.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:20.526
Ray, Ray...

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.805
It's not mine.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.967
I'm heading out.

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:48.484
Why don't you go take a shower
and by the time you're ready,

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:49.966
I will be back.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.487
Okay.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.166
And then we'll take care of...

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.521
Don't go anywhere.

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.411
Where would I go?

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.766
<i>Miss Clayton, it's
Detective Giardello.</i>

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.845
Yes, Detective?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.446
Look, I'm not calling
with the best of news.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.171
My partner and I tracked
down Dr. Fontaine

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.767
and I'm sorry to inform you that

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:51.411
he was found dead.
He's been murdered.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.364
<i>If you are who I think
you are, I think you're</i>

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.090
<i>at the center of something
very dangerous.</i>

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.611
I'm sorry, Miss Clayton.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.920
<i>What do I do?</i>

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.288
Look, we're on our way.
We're gonna be there in an hour.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.283
Don't leave and don't
answer the door, all right?

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:04.329
Thank you, Detective.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.126
Let's go.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.161
I just know I don't
wanna be involved.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.206
I think you should
have her for dinner.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.011
I wanna take you outside.

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.206
She reminded me of...

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.406
Well, you know, you were there.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.201
<i>Well, I was...</i>

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.245
I was just a child then.

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:53.126
No, you can't talk to Ray.
You can't talk to anybody.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.160
You've gotta trust me, girl.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.766
Excuse me.

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.286
I'd like to see someone
about closing an account.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.328
That would be Mr. Ross,
the bank manager.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.004
His desk is right over there.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.366
Thank you.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:15.841
Giardello.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.048
Detective, this is
Abigail Clayton.

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.645
We're on our way.
Ls everything all right?

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:20.721
<i>On your way?</i>

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.802
<i>Yeah, since we last spoke.</i>

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.689
Since we last spoke?
Two weeks ago?

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:26.763
No, we spoke less
than a half hour ago.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.764
No, you must be mistaken. I was in the shower.
I didn't take any calls.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.410
That wasn't you I
was talking to?

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.005
No. Oh, my God.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.167
How can I help you?

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.481
I'd like to close
out an account.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.086
All right.

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:44.366
You can hang on to this.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.331
All righty.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.770
Account closure.

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.647
Hulahoop14.

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:10.686
Oh...

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:16.927
Oh, there we go.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:25.285
All right, Miss Clayton.

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.091
Everything appears
to be in order here.

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.761
Wonderful.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:36.129
Now, before we finish, I'm required
to ask you a few questions.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.567
I apologize. It'll just take
a few minutes of your time.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.044
Justine Waters has decided
to come out of hiding.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:48.846
Out of ink.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.400
Oh, it's gonna be one of
those days, all right.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:54.763
She will be at the Waters
Bank, 59th and Broadway.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.286
All right.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.051
Were you at anytime
dissatisfied with our service?

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:01.961
No.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.091
Glad to hear it.

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:06.845
She goes by the name
Abigail Clayton and...

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.810
May I ask, what are your reasons
for withdrawing your money?

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:12.042
She'll be wearing a black dress.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.646
I'm leaving the country.

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:15.768
Wonderful!
Are you going to Europe?

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.842
I was just in Paris
with my fiancée.

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:20.844
We stayed at...
Oh, God, what is the name of that hotel?

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.049
It was great.
It had these butlers in it and...

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.685
Oh, man, what is the
name of that hotel?

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.685
Excuse me.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.365
Fellas, how's it going?

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.966
Looks like you guys got a
busy day ahead of you, huh?

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.610
Make sure you stay
hydrated out there.

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:41.207
Remember, only stop at the red
lights and the short skirts, huh?

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.606
Okay.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.647
Are you all right?

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.043
Yes... Yes, I'm...

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.209
I just need to hurry.
I have a plane to catch.

01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.722
Ah. Leaving things till the last minute, huh?
A woman after my own heart.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:03.201
My father always says, "If you
didn't do it at the last minute,"

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.361
"you didn't do it right."

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.480
That's funny.

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:07.721
Yeah. He's a funny guy.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.371
Finally, is there anything
we can do to improve?

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.805
No. You've been great.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:15.927
Well, thank you.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.286
Okay. So...

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.805
Are there any other
questions I can answer

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.450
for you before we
liquidate your account?

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:23.490
Yes. Can you give me
the account balance?

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.765
Not a problem.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.607
720 million?

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.161
Yeah.

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.968
You want it all in singles?

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:47.200
Are you gonna buy France?

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:48.721
Oh, my God.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.288
720 million. Oh, my God.

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:57.363
You are a card. No, $7.20.

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.489
So did you want that
in a cashier's check?

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.725
$7.20. Is that...

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.844
Is that not accurate?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.810
I had $7.20 to my name.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.801
Miss Clayton, are you all right?

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.601
Psst.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.961
What are you doing here?

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.121
I left.

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:53.801
I couldn't stay there any more.

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.245
You made sure of that.

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.322
Can we go someplace and talk?

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:01.770
I don't think there's
time for that, Abigail

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:03.526
I made some phone calls.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.090
Phone calls? Yeah.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.328
I called a whole
bunch of people.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.767
I mean, you've been in
hiding for a long time.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.842
This is your big coming
out party, Abigail.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.570
Why do you keep
calling me Abigail?

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:17.201
That's what you told the man
your name was. Didn't you?

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.362
That's what you wanted to do.

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.920
Steal my life, look like me,

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.206
steal my money.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.569
Or maybe it's Justine.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.771
I'm sorry.

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:30.205
I have so much to tell you.

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.930
Gee, I don't think
we have much time,

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.570
so I hope it's not a long story.

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:34.801
Please.

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.009
There's gotta be another way.

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.084
You should leave.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.561
Go.

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.767
There's a body in
your apartment.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.560
Black dress, black dress.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.449
Excuse me!
Excuse me, are you Justine Waters?

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.443

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.481
