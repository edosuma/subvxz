WEBVTT

00:02.236 --> 00:05.738
So in "My Last Duchess",
the narrator keeps a

00:05.773 --> 00:08.273
painting of his murder
victim behind a curtain

00:08.309 --> 00:10.943
that only he has
the power to open.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.511
Student: Psycho.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.814
Yeah. A total psycho,
but a very charming one.

00:15.916 --> 00:18.017
However, in
"Porphyria's Lover"

00:18.119 --> 00:20.586
the murderer is
actually a madman

00:20.621 --> 00:22.821
who wants to prolong
a perfect moment

00:22.923 --> 00:25.024
with his lover
by killing her.

00:26.794 --> 00:31.330
[DING] On that note, your
papers are due on Friday.

00:31.432 --> 00:34.199
Do not forget -
especially you.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.001
Goodbye.

00:36.103 --> 00:37.202
Bye.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.512
[door slams shut]

00:46.614 --> 00:48.881
[gasps] Oh my god.
You scared me.

00:48.983 --> 00:49.782
[laughs]

00:49.817 --> 00:50.682
Hi.

00:50.785 --> 00:52.284
Hi.

00:52.319 --> 00:55.054
I just could not
wait another minute

00:55.156 --> 00:56.789
to see you.

00:56.824 --> 01:00.059
Well, we.. did you come
here to have lunch with me?

01:00.161 --> 01:02.227
Uh, you know,
tempting as that is,

01:02.329 --> 01:04.063
I've actually got to
get back to work.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.097
So, hold on
a second.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.900
You came all the way
here to give me a kiss?

01:08.002 --> 01:09.935
Yeah. I
kind of did.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.103
Oh my god,
you're amazing.

01:11.138 --> 01:13.705
Mmm.

01:13.808 --> 01:14.773
Wow.

01:14.809 --> 01:15.974
Some kiss,
though.

01:16.010 --> 01:17.643
Yeah. It was.

01:38.165 --> 01:39.098
[inhales sharply]

01:41.869 --> 01:43.335
Raf...

01:43.370 --> 01:46.305
[laughs] You
forgot your coat.

01:59.019 --> 02:01.253
Hey, are you,
uh, free tonight?

02:01.355 --> 02:02.888
Yes. Yes, I am.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.957
Violet is going to a
party and then she's

02:05.059 --> 02:06.725
spending the night
at a friend's house.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.595
We'll have the whole
night to ourselves.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.864
I'll call
you later.

02:11.899 --> 02:12.798
-Okay.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.415
This is so pretty.

02:30.451 --> 02:35.988
Had it.. hold on. Oh,
I can't quite hold...

02:36.090 --> 02:37.990
This is really
hard. [laughs]

02:38.092 --> 02:39.158
Um, hello.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.993
[gasps] You
found it!

02:41.095 --> 02:42.060
-I did.

02:42.096 --> 02:43.929
Promise me you won't
get anything on it, okay"

02:43.964 --> 02:44.863
-Promise.

02:44.899 --> 02:46.031
And you have to clean
your room tomorrow.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.366
-I promise.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.667
Okay, good.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.068
[phone ringing].
I'll get it.

02:50.104 --> 02:51.336
Need some help?

02:51.438 --> 02:53.205
-[laughs] Yes.

02:53.240 --> 02:57.009
Oh. Hi, Raf.
Mom, it's for you.

02:57.111 --> 02:58.744
Raf, she'll just
be a second. Hey.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.045
-Hey, Violet.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.481
Hey, so I hear you're
going to a party tonight.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.217
Is that guy you like,
Mike, gonna be there?

03:05.252 --> 03:07.753
Um, yeah. I mean..
I mean, I hope so.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.688
Well, just remember
what I told you.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.323
Always gotta play-

03:11.425 --> 03:14.059
-Play hard to
get. I know.

03:14.094 --> 03:16.261
Did my mother tell you
to say that to me again?

03:16.297 --> 03:18.230
[laughing]
No way.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.132
It's true,
though, Violet.

03:20.167 --> 03:23.435
Guys, they, uh,
they love the chase.

03:23.470 --> 03:27.105
Okay. Um, now Raf,
I'm going to give you

03:27.141 --> 03:28.974
a little bit of
advice, okay?

03:29.009 --> 03:30.108
Hit me.

03:30.277 --> 03:33.011
-You can let life lead you
where it wants sometimes.

03:33.113 --> 03:36.081
Not everything
has to be perfect.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.382
-Duly noted.

03:37.484 --> 03:38.917
Have I told
you, Violet,

03:38.953 --> 03:40.419
you are wise
beyond your years?

03:40.454 --> 03:41.720
-Thank you.

03:41.822 --> 03:42.988
-Yes, hard to get.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.691
Hard to get is good.
Play very hard to get.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.359
I love the
advice you give her.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.328
And I loved
that kiss.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.963
Me too.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.565
So listen, the girls are
going to leave soon, um,

03:53.667 --> 03:56.401
why don't you come
over around eightish?

03:56.503 --> 03:59.204
Yeah. About
that... um..

03:59.306 --> 04:01.807
Listen, I just got a
call that I have to fly

04:01.842 --> 04:05.410
to Tokyo in the morning
and I got a ton of work

04:05.512 --> 04:08.080
I gotta get done
before then. So...

04:08.182 --> 04:11.149
Um, okay.

04:11.185 --> 04:14.253
-But I'm going to
make it up to you.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.321
when I get back,
I've got a really

04:16.357 --> 04:18.257
special night
planned for us.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.791
I'll miss you.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.394
Yeah, yeah, I'll miss
you- I'll miss you too.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.664
Um, travel
safe. Bye.

04:28.335 --> 04:29.968
We're off.

04:30.004 --> 04:31.803
Seriously, already?
-What?

04:31.839 --> 04:33.438
Get over here.
[car honking]

04:33.540 --> 04:35.374
That's Carrie, we
gotta go, we gotta go.

04:35.409 --> 04:38.176
-Okay, fine. Go. But,
no texting and driving.

04:38.212 --> 04:39.144
I'll tell her.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.113
You girls look out for
each other, and don't

04:41.215 --> 04:43.882
go into any rooms
alone with boys.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.384
I know. I know.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.451
Mrs. Fieri, you
don't have to worry.

04:46.553 --> 04:47.786
Violet can use
the safe word

04:47.888 --> 04:49.221
that we use when
we need rescuing,

04:49.256 --> 04:50.422
like if a guy gets
too aggressive.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.057
Or like
super boring.

04:52.092 --> 04:52.991
-It's not funny.

04:53.193 --> 04:54.960
We just say "cotton
candy", and that's our

04:55.062 --> 04:56.395
clue to get each
other out of there.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.163
Cotton candy... that
was your safe word

04:58.198 --> 04:59.531
when you were
a little girl.

04:59.566 --> 05:00.766
Yes.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.100
You remember.
I love you.

05:02.202 --> 05:05.270
Okay, we're going. Stop,
you're ruining my makeup.

05:05.372 --> 05:06.905
-Okay, girls.
Have fun.

05:06.940 --> 05:07.973
We will, bye!

05:08.075 --> 05:09.141
-But not
too much.

05:09.243 --> 05:10.842
[laughing]

05:10.878 --> 05:13.111
Hey, Cam.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.212
Hey.

05:14.248 --> 05:15.547
Brunch tomorrow?

05:15.582 --> 05:17.282
Yeah. I'll
bring the bagels.

05:17.384 --> 05:18.483
Yes!

05:22.423 --> 05:24.323
[door closes
loudly]

05:55.422 --> 05:56.521
Raf?

06:01.962 --> 06:03.929
Raf, are
you here?

06:08.435 --> 06:10.202
Raf?

06:15.275 --> 06:17.275
[loud noise
from upstairs]

06:20.013 --> 06:21.279
Raf?

06:26.487 --> 06:28.053
Raf?

06:30.457 --> 06:32.023
[door closing
downstairs]

06:32.126 --> 06:32.958
[sigh]

06:59.319 --> 07:00.752
[loud noise]

07:07.027 --> 07:11.997
[dog barking
in the distance]

07:18.005 --> 07:19.070
[knocking]

07:19.173 --> 07:23.408
Raf? Are
you in here?

07:23.510 --> 07:27.345
Hello?

07:27.381 --> 07:29.448
What is this?

07:34.188 --> 07:35.520
Hunter...

07:46.233 --> 07:47.032
What...

07:51.605 --> 07:53.104
[loud camera
shutter]

07:53.207 --> 07:54.639
[loud
camera shutter]

07:56.243 --> 07:59.277
[suspenseful music]

07:59.379 --> 08:01.346
[loud camera
shutter]

08:01.381 --> 08:15.160
[suspenseful music]

08:15.262 --> 08:17.062
[gasping]

08:26.773 --> 08:30.742
Oh my god.
What is going on?

08:30.777 --> 08:33.912
[rapid loud
camera shutter]

08:40.754 --> 08:42.487
[door closes]

08:42.589 --> 08:45.056
Ah.. [door locks]

08:45.092 --> 08:46.758
Camille, Camille...

08:46.793 --> 08:50.695
It wasn't supposed
to happen this way.

08:50.797 --> 08:54.032
Rafael, what's going
on? what is this?

08:54.134 --> 08:56.501
You've ruined it.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.403
I had a big night
planned for us

08:58.438 --> 09:01.172
when I got
back from Tokyo.

09:01.275 --> 09:04.209
Now it's
all ruined.

09:06.146 --> 09:09.614
So I guess tonight's gonna
have to be the night.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.116
Rafael, you're not
making any sense.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.084
You're scaring me.
What's happening?

09:13.120 --> 09:15.287
The night
for what?

09:20.827 --> 09:23.695
Actually, tonight
might be perfect.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.331
You're
obviously ready...

09:26.366 --> 09:27.933
or else you wouldn't
have come over here

09:27.968 --> 09:32.470
wearing that... if
you weren't ready.

09:32.506 --> 09:35.240
Ready for what?

09:35.342 --> 09:40.478
Now Camille. I need you to
tell me that you love me.

09:40.514 --> 09:46.718
What? [sobbing]

09:46.820 --> 09:51.256
Don't act like
you don't know.

09:51.358 --> 09:54.225
I saw it in your
eyes, earlier.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.861
You were ready to give
me your entire self,

09:56.897 --> 09:59.598
not just your
body, your heart.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.099
The way you
looked at me

10:01.201 --> 10:03.335
after you
found that ring...

10:03.370 --> 10:08.807
In fact, why don't
you just put this on?

10:08.842 --> 10:12.644
[suspenseful music]

10:12.679 --> 10:14.179
Oh my god.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.780
-Just put
this on.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.649
[crying] Oh my
god, you're insane.

10:17.684 --> 10:21.620
Not. Insane. Camille!

10:21.722 --> 10:27.459
[suspenseful music]

10:27.561 --> 10:30.462
I just enjoy
the hunt...

10:30.564 --> 10:35.834
the thrill of
the chase...

10:35.869 --> 10:39.971
and, of course,
the kill.

10:50.083 --> 10:54.753
I need you to
tell me you love me.

10:54.788 --> 10:57.088
Just say
those words.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.724
[phone ringing] It's
Violet. It's Violet.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.426
-Do not
answer that!

11:01.461 --> 11:02.560
Hi, baby.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.199
[dance music]
Mom?

11:08.235 --> 11:11.369
Is everything
okay?

11:11.405 --> 11:14.239
Yes, everything's fine,
we're being totally safe.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.507
It's fine.

11:15.609 --> 11:18.677
Mom, are
you okay?

11:18.779 --> 11:23.848
Oh baby, I'm fine.
I'm just a little bit

11:23.950 --> 11:27.185
tired right
now, that's all.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.655
I'm just going
to lay down,

11:30.757 --> 11:34.259
maybe have a
glass of wine

11:34.294 --> 11:37.662
and some of that
cotton candy we got.

11:37.764 --> 11:42.801
[ominous music]

11:42.836 --> 11:46.237
I love you,
Violet.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.707
I love you
too, mom.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.714
Hey, Jonah just came
with a really cute friend.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.849
Lisa, my mom just
said "cotton candy"

11:57.951 --> 11:59.150
on the phone.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.186
You think she was
saying it as a joke?

12:01.288 --> 12:02.821
No, there's no way
she'd say it as a joke.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.522
She taught me that you
only say the safe word

12:04.624 --> 12:06.858
if you're
in trouble.

12:06.960 --> 12:11.629
I'm going
to call 9-1-1.

12:11.665 --> 12:16.735
[ominous music]

12:16.837 --> 12:21.239
Yeah... That's good.

12:21.341 --> 12:27.579
Now, say the
words, Camille.

12:27.681 --> 12:31.516
Say the words...

12:31.551 --> 12:35.720
Say it.

12:35.822 --> 12:37.722
You want me to
tell you I love you?

12:37.824 --> 12:39.557
-Yes.

12:39.659 --> 12:42.093
You know
I love you.

12:42.195 --> 12:46.931
Rafael, put down
the knife. Please.

12:47.033 --> 12:49.100
Please...

12:54.508 --> 12:55.940
Auugh!

12:56.042 --> 13:02.881
[suspenseful music]

13:02.916 --> 13:04.015
Help!

13:07.587 --> 13:08.553
Help!

13:08.588 --> 13:11.322
Please help me.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.625
The guy in there
is trying to kill me.

13:13.727 --> 13:15.994
[door bangs
open and shut]

13:22.035 --> 13:23.668
I was
so scared.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.670
I'm so glad
you're okay.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.472
-Thank you.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.274
I love you.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.409
Okay. You
can relax.

13:31.444 --> 13:32.644
We found him.

13:32.746 --> 13:34.913
[exhales]

13:34.948 --> 13:36.915
I'm-I'm so
glad that

13:36.950 --> 13:39.951
he's going to be
locked up, right?

13:40.053 --> 13:41.619
Like, he can't..
he can't get out

13:41.721 --> 13:43.555
and come after
me again?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.623
We're going to do
everything that we can.

13:45.725 --> 13:47.926

also new to this place.

my granddad,

27:23.409 --> 27:25.309

too good, and, well,

27:25.411 --> 27:27.011
there was no one
else to look after him

27:27.046 --> 27:29.613
so here I am
and unfortunately,

27:29.715 --> 27:31.749
things took a turn
for the worse.

27:31.784 --> 27:34.351
The doctors recommended
that I put him in a home.

27:34.387 --> 27:36.854
So, yeah, that's what I'm
dealing with right now,

27:36.889 --> 27:39.790

mistake and- I don't know.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.659
Yeah, yeah, we
totally get that.

27:41.761 --> 27:44.495

also in a nursing home,

27:44.597 --> 27:46.697
he used to live
with us, and then

27:46.732 --> 27:48.265
his dementia
got really bad.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.234
It was probably
the hardest decision

27:50.269 --> 27:53.337
I ever made - but..
it's been great.

27:53.439 --> 27:54.672

wonderful to him.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.373

so great to them,

27:56.409 --> 27:58.175

trips all the time.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.410

for example,

27:59.445 --> 28:01.545
they went to see the
Philadelphia Orchestra.

28:01.580 --> 28:04.181

Orchestra? From Miami?

28:04.283 --> 28:06.083

quite the field trip.

28:06.118 --> 28:09.086

Orchestra came to Florida

them on this field trip.

Um, I'm not going to be
able to make it tonight.

52:59.243 --> 53:00.276
Sorry.

53:00.311 --> 53:03.078
Well, is everything okay,
Emilee? What happened?

53:03.114 --> 53:05.748
Nothing happened, really,
I just, I don't know.

53:05.783 --> 53:07.583
I just told Lillie she
couldn't go camping,

53:07.618 --> 53:09.718
I have a really bad
feeling about tonight.

53:09.754 --> 53:13.322
Yeah. If horses
can feel vibes

53:13.457 --> 53:15.524
maybe people
can as well.

53:15.560 --> 53:17.393
Although...

53:17.428 --> 53:18.761
What do you mean?

53:18.796 --> 53:20.829
-I don't know, Emilee,
you know, I'm thinking

53:20.965 --> 53:23.666
maybe if there really is
this lunatic out there,

53:23.734 --> 53:25.401
perhaps it's better
that Lillie's in the

53:25.436 --> 53:27.403
middle of nowhere
with all her friends.

53:27.438 --> 53:29.538
I'm thinking she'd
be safer out there.

53:29.574 --> 53:30.839
Maybe it'd be
more difficult

53:30.908 --> 53:33.242
for him to track her
out there, you know?

53:33.277 --> 53:35.678
You know what? That
is a really good point.

53:35.746 --> 53:37.580
I didn't even
think about that.

53:37.615 --> 53:39.715
You know what? it
doesn't matter anyway.

53:39.750 --> 53:41.517
Her friends have already
left and I can't take her

53:41.652 --> 53:44.153
because I can't miss
my first PTA meeting.

53:44.255 --> 53:46.188
It's okay, I can
give her a ride.

53:46.324 --> 53:47.389
I'm not
doing anything.

53:47.425 --> 53:48.791
No. No. No.

53:48.826 --> 53:51.060
I would never ask you
to do that, it's fine.

53:51.095 --> 53:52.761
No, no, it's okay.
It's my pleasure.

53:52.797 --> 53:54.363
Be there in five
minutes, okay?

53:54.498 --> 53:55.698
Really?

53:55.833 --> 53:58.534
Thank you. Thank
you so much.

54:01.505 --> 54:04.039
[honking]

54:04.175 --> 54:05.975
Okay, bye mom,
I love you.

54:06.010 --> 54:09.111
I will text you
every hour, I promise.

54:12.450 --> 54:13.549
Bye.

54:20.691 --> 54:23.559
[crickets chirping]

54:33.304 --> 54:35.437
Here. Water,
it's a long trip.

54:35.473 --> 54:37.239
Oh, thank you.

54:39.677 --> 54:40.609
Mmm.

54:43.848 --> 54:45.914
Are you sure that we're
going the right way

54:46.050 --> 54:47.583
'cause it looks
like we're in the

54:47.718 --> 54:48.817
middle of nowhere.

54:48.853 --> 54:51.253
Oh, no, no. It's
the right way.

54:56.894 --> 54:59.328
You can put on some
music if you want.

54:59.363 --> 55:01.330
-Sure.

55:01.365 --> 55:04.266
[country music]

55:10.741 --> 55:12.608
[shuts music off]

55:12.743 --> 55:14.610
What's up, you don't
like that song?

55:14.679 --> 55:19.114
No, I do. It's
just it reminds me

55:19.183 --> 55:22.818
of someone, but
it's over, so...

55:22.920 --> 55:25.321
I wouldn't worry
too much because

55:25.356 --> 55:27.890
if you're meant
to be with Mike,

55:27.925 --> 55:30.025
you will find
each other again.

55:41.205 --> 55:43.906
Did I tell you
his name was Mike?

55:43.941 --> 55:47.509
No, no. Your mother
mentioned it to me.

55:47.545 --> 56:03.492
[suspenseful music]

56:19.510 --> 56:21.977
[tires on gravel]

56:22.012 --> 56:24.079
What's going on?
Why'd we stop?

56:24.181 --> 56:27.149
We got a flat,
you didn't feel it?

56:30.354 --> 56:31.720
[door shuts]

56:31.856 --> 56:41.563
[suspenseful music]

56:41.665 --> 56:44.600
Why don't you come out
and give me a hand?

56:53.210 --> 56:57.246
[suspenseful music]

56:57.314 --> 56:58.614
Thank you so
much for coming in,

56:58.649 --> 57:00.416
I really enjoyed
meeting both of you.

57:00.551 --> 57:01.784
Thank you.

57:04.388 --> 57:05.554
Hi. All done?

57:05.656 --> 57:07.456
-Hey, yes,
I'm all done.

57:07.491 --> 57:08.624
Good, good.

57:08.659 --> 57:10.626
Hey, what
happened?

57:10.661 --> 57:12.761
Well, it looks like
a little grease.

57:12.897 --> 57:14.596
Oh, yeah, must've
happened while I

57:14.732 --> 57:16.565
changed the
tire on my car.

57:16.667 --> 57:17.733
-Oh, is
everything okay?

57:17.835 --> 57:19.268
Yeah, yep-yep.
All good.

57:19.403 --> 57:21.103
It's me you gotta
worry about now.

57:21.238 --> 57:22.771
[laughing] Um,
thank you for that.

57:22.907 --> 57:24.807
It's no
problem at all.

57:24.909 --> 57:27.509
And, well, if I
must be honest,

57:27.545 --> 57:29.711
I did have a secret
motive all along.

57:29.747 --> 57:31.380
-What?

57:31.415 --> 57:32.881
Well...

57:32.917 --> 57:36.485
I wanted to have you
all to myself tonight.

57:36.520 --> 57:37.820
I like that.

57:49.600 --> 57:51.567
This is amazing.

57:51.602 --> 57:54.136
Where did you learn
to make coq au vin?

57:54.271 --> 57:56.472
[laughing] Well,
I could tell you,

57:56.607 --> 57:58.240
but then I'd
have to kill you.

57:58.275 --> 58:00.476
[laughing]

58:00.611 --> 58:02.711
Champagne?

58:02.746 --> 58:05.747
Yes.

58:05.783 --> 58:07.382
I'll be
right back.

58:13.624 --> 58:29.571
[sinister music]

59:16.320 --> 59:17.853
Oh my, god.

59:17.955 --> 59:21.723
Wow, that
is beautiful.

59:21.792 --> 59:25.761
Brian, this is seriously
the best Valentine's Day.

59:25.863 --> 59:28.830
Well, it's
not over yet.

59:28.866 --> 59:35.637
Well, the thing
is, Emilee, I, uh,

59:35.673 --> 59:37.406
I'm very well
aware we haven't

59:37.541 --> 59:39.274
known each
other that long.

59:39.310 --> 59:41.076
But you gotta admit
the last couple of months

59:41.145 --> 59:42.511
have been pretty
intense, right?

59:42.546 --> 59:43.478
Yeah.

59:43.514 --> 59:45.013
-Yeah.

59:45.049 --> 59:47.683
Look, I guess what I'm
really trying to say is

59:47.718 --> 59:52.254
that, um, I've been
suppressing my feelings.

59:52.323 --> 59:53.822
I've been
suppressing the way

59:53.857 --> 59:55.424
I really feel
toward you

59:55.492 --> 59:57.426
because of what you've
been going through.

59:57.561 --> 59:59.995
And well, I guess
I've made a decision

1:00:00.030 --> 1:00:04.099
not to deny the way I
feel about you anymore.

1:00:11.041 --> 1:00:13.342
[phone ringing]

1:00:13.377 --> 1:00:14.776
I am so sorry.

1:00:14.845 --> 1:00:17.312
That could be Lillie,
give me one second.

1:00:17.414 --> 1:00:18.513
Just one second.

1:00:18.549 --> 1:00:19.648
Sorry.

1:00:24.688 --> 1:00:26.421
Hello?

1:00:26.523 --> 1:00:28.357
Agent Halloran?

1:00:28.392 --> 1:00:30.359
Camille, I'm sorry
to call you so late.

1:00:30.394 --> 1:00:31.793
We've had
a development

1:00:31.929 --> 1:00:33.495
and I wanted
to fill you in.

1:00:33.530 --> 1:00:35.330
We were able to
track down the doctor

1:00:35.366 --> 1:00:36.932
who worked
on Rafael.

1:00:37.034 --> 1:00:39.434
His remains,
actually.

1:00:39.536 --> 1:00:42.170
He died a few
months ago in a fire.

1:00:42.206 --> 1:00:45.707
Does that mean..
did Rafael kill him?

1:00:45.743 --> 1:00:46.975
-We think so.

1:00:47.044 --> 1:00:50.045
But this doctor,
he's a plastic surgeon.

1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:52.948
So we're thinking
Rafael wasn't actually

1:00:53.050 --> 1:00:54.616
injured in
the escape.

1:00:54.718 --> 1:00:56.918
We think he may have
altered his appearance.

1:00:56.954 --> 1:01:00.188
He-he changed his
appearance so...

1:01:00.224 --> 1:01:02.057
Listen, I'm not
trying to scare you

1:01:02.092 --> 1:01:04.493
but we don't know what
Rafael looks like right now.

1:01:04.561 --> 1:01:06.662
Now if he did alter
his appearance enough,

1:01:06.797 --> 1:01:09.331
he might be completely
unrecognizable.

1:01:09.466 --> 1:01:13.068
So I might not know
who he is if I saw him?

1:01:13.103 --> 1:01:14.503
-We did find a
hotel clerk and

1:01:14.638 --> 1:01:16.171
he saw Rafael when
he was checking out.

1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:17.739
He's going to do
a sketch for us

1:01:17.775 --> 1:01:19.841
so we'll know what
Rafael looks like soon,

1:01:19.977 --> 1:01:21.510
I promise, and I
will email that to you

1:01:21.645 --> 1:01:22.944
as soon as I
have it, okay?

1:01:22.980 --> 1:01:25.614
[gasping]
Okay.

1:01:25.649 --> 1:01:27.749
And in the meantime,
I'm sending the Marshal

1:01:27.785 --> 1:01:29.951
to your house to pick up
you and your daughter.

1:01:29.987 --> 1:01:31.687
Wait-wait. We're
not home right now,

1:01:31.755 --> 1:01:33.288
I-I need to go
and get Lillie.

1:01:33.323 --> 1:01:34.956
I'm going to go pick
her up and then we can

1:01:34.992 --> 1:01:37.659
meet the Marshal
at my house. Okay?

1:01:37.761 --> 1:01:42.431
Okay. Thank you.

1:01:42.466 --> 1:01:45.867
[gasping]

1:01:46.003 --> 1:01:49.004
Are you okay?
What happened?

1:01:49.106 --> 1:01:50.839
I couldn't help
but overhearing

1:01:50.941 --> 1:01:53.442
the stalker
changed his identity?

1:01:53.477 --> 1:01:56.378
I-I need to go get Lillie
and I need to go home.

1:01:56.513 --> 1:01:59.448
I'm sorry. I
need to call her.

1:02:03.787 --> 1:02:05.554
She's not answering.

1:02:05.622 --> 1:02:07.522
Lillie, Lillie,
if you get this,

1:02:07.624 --> 1:02:10.392
please call me back, I'm
coming to get you right now.

1:02:10.461 --> 1:02:13.829
I feel like I'm
gonna be sick.

1:02:13.864 --> 1:02:29.811
[suspenseful music]

1:02:35.152 --> 1:02:37.319
[door closing

1:02:57.007 --> 1:03:12.954
[ominous music]

1:03:16.760 --> 1:03:17.659
-Hey.

1:03:17.861 --> 1:03:20.729
[gasp] I'm sorry. I
just need a minute.

1:03:20.764 --> 1:03:22.397
-Sure.

1:03:22.432 --> 1:03:25.534
But it seems you found
my deep, dark secret.

1:03:29.740 --> 1:03:31.807
What do
you mean?

1:03:31.875 --> 1:03:36.111
-That I'm a
sentimental fool.

1:03:36.213 --> 1:03:39.648
It's my
granddad's room.

1:03:39.783 --> 1:03:43.151
Hey, granted he'll
never see any of these

1:03:43.287 --> 1:03:45.053
clothes again, I just
can't bring myself

1:03:45.088 --> 1:03:47.956
to get rid
of them.

1:03:48.058 --> 1:03:49.758
Look how organized
this guy was.

1:03:49.793 --> 1:03:51.593
He was
ex-military.

1:03:51.628 --> 1:03:53.395
I'm gonna
miss him.

1:03:58.268 --> 1:04:00.669
Did that sketch come
in? Check your email,

1:04:00.804 --> 1:04:03.705
maybe-maybe the
sketch has come in.

1:04:10.781 --> 1:04:12.681
-Yeah. Yes.

1:04:18.822 --> 1:04:20.689
Does he
look familiar?

1:04:24.328 --> 1:04:25.861
-No.

1:04:31.501 --> 1:04:34.202
The email says that I
need to get to a safe

1:04:34.271 --> 1:04:37.205
place and I need to
get rid of my phone.

1:04:37.341 --> 1:04:39.574
Yeah. That makes
sense, Emilee.

1:04:39.676 --> 1:04:43.712
Okay. Listen, I
know of a cabin

1:04:43.847 --> 1:04:45.113
a couple of
hours from here.

1:04:45.148 --> 1:04:46.381
My friend
owns it.

1:04:46.516 --> 1:04:48.783
If you like, I
can take you there.

1:04:48.819 --> 1:04:49.818
-Okay.

1:04:49.853 --> 1:04:51.186
Okay. But you have
to do everything

1:04:51.288 --> 1:04:52.988
the FBI tells
you to do.

1:04:53.023 --> 1:04:55.056
-Okay.

1:04:55.192 --> 1:04:58.727
I need to call
Lillie. I...

1:04:58.862 --> 1:05:01.296
Call from
my phone, okay?

1:05:01.331 --> 1:05:03.031
It's safer.
Call on the way.

1:05:03.133 --> 1:05:04.232
Let me take that.

1:05:04.368 --> 1:05:05.834
-Okay, we need
to call her.

1:05:05.869 --> 1:05:08.236
Okay. Come on...

1:05:08.372 --> 1:05:09.905
Come on.

1:05:23.320 --> 1:05:25.787
Yeah, that
was the man.

1:05:28.692 --> 1:05:31.326
-Okay. Email it to
Camille immediately.

1:05:38.001 --> 1:05:53.949

1:06:33.223 --> 1:06:38.793

1:06:40.831 --> 1:06:43.098
[car stopping]

1:06:43.166 --> 1:06:46.134
Okay. I'll be
back in a minute.

1:06:51.675 --> 1:06:55.710
Violet? Violet?

1:06:55.746 --> 1:06:56.845
Violet?

1:06:56.880 --> 1:06:58.113
-Hi, hi.

1:06:58.248 --> 1:07:00.348
Hi. Is this Ashley's
Sweet 16 party?

1:07:00.384 --> 1:07:02.017
Yeah, it is. I'm Joy,
her older sister.

1:07:02.052 --> 1:07:03.885
Great. I'm here to pick
up my daughter, Violet.

1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:05.020
Violet?

1:07:05.055 --> 1:07:06.221
-Yeah.

1:07:06.256 --> 1:07:07.956
There's no one by
that name here.

1:07:08.025 --> 1:07:08.890
Of course
there is.

1:07:08.925 --> 1:07:10.792
she was just dropped
off two hours ago.

1:07:10.927 --> 1:07:11.960
Violet!

1:07:12.029 --> 1:07:12.961
Mom?

1:07:13.096 --> 1:07:14.462
Violet!

1:07:14.598 --> 1:07:16.031
Mom, what are
you doing here?

1:07:16.066 --> 1:07:17.132
-Get your stuff,
we gotta go.

1:07:17.267 --> 1:07:18.800
Come on, get
your stuff.

1:07:18.935 --> 1:07:20.335
-Okay. Okay.

1:07:22.739 --> 1:07:24.472
Violet? I thought
your name was Lillie.

1:07:24.608 --> 1:07:25.740
Oh it-it's like
a nickname.

1:07:25.776 --> 1:07:26.808
We have to go.

1:07:26.943 --> 1:07:28.610
Tell Ashley
I said bye.

1:07:28.712 --> 1:07:29.978
Okay?

1:07:38.622 --> 1:07:39.587
What's going on?

1:07:39.623 --> 1:07:41.022
The phone,
Emilee.

1:07:41.058 --> 1:07:42.991
Give me
your phone.

1:07:44.061 --> 1:07:45.060
Mom!

1:07:45.095 --> 1:07:47.162
Go, I'll
explain later.

1:07:49.466 --> 1:07:51.666
Wait, so you're saying
that we have no idea

1:07:51.735 --> 1:07:53.535
what Rafael looks
like anymore?

1:07:53.570 --> 1:07:55.003
No, sweetie,
we do.

1:07:55.138 --> 1:07:57.172
Agent Halloran
texted me a picture

1:07:57.240 --> 1:07:59.274
but I didn't
recognize the face.

1:07:59.309 --> 1:08:02.277
-Well, can I see it?
The sketch, I mean,

1:08:02.312 --> 1:08:04.813
maybe I have seen
him around school

1:08:04.915 --> 1:08:06.481
or in town or
something?

1:08:06.583 --> 1:08:08.249
No, sweetie. I don't
have the sketch anymore

1:08:08.285 --> 1:08:10.085
because I don't
have a phone.

1:08:10.120 --> 1:08:11.686
But I'm
telling you,

1:08:11.822 --> 1:08:13.188
if Rafael was
at this school,

1:08:13.323 --> 1:08:14.956
I would've recognized
him, I know it.

1:08:14.991 --> 1:08:17.225
Babe, we're going
someplace safe.

1:08:17.260 --> 1:08:18.760
Let's just..

1:08:18.795 --> 1:08:21.129
let's both try to get
some sleep, okay?

1:08:21.164 --> 1:08:24.232
And I'll just, I'll wake
you when we get there.

1:08:28.839 --> 1:08:30.071
Did you tell
Agent Halloran

1:08:30.107 --> 1:08:31.806
where we're
going?

1:08:31.842 --> 1:08:33.041
No. No.

1:08:33.176 --> 1:08:36.077
But as soon as I get
to the cabin, I will.

1:08:59.803 --> 1:09:01.803
Hey, it's me.
I'm at the house.

1:09:01.838 --> 1:09:03.138
She's not here.

1:09:25.061 --> 1:09:27.562
Oh, man.

1:09:27.664 --> 1:09:29.764
I think she's
with him.

1:09:29.900 --> 1:09:32.233
They could be miles
from here by now.

1:09:32.335 --> 1:09:34.502
If she's even
still alive.

You're not sleeping?

1:10:13.944 --> 1:10:17.579
Oh, no,
I-I can't.

1:10:17.614 --> 1:10:19.981
Um, mom, how are
you going to call

1:10:20.050 --> 1:10:22.250
Agent Halloran if you
don't have a phone?

1:10:22.285 --> 1:10:24.085
-Brian has a phone.

1:10:24.120 --> 1:10:26.788
Oh, uh, cool, c-could
I borrow it for a sec?

1:10:26.890 --> 1:10:29.290
-Yeah, sure,
of course.

1:10:29.392 --> 1:10:32.493
Ugh. It's out
of juice.

1:10:32.629 --> 1:10:36.331
Who were you thinking
of calling anyway?

1:10:36.466 --> 1:10:39.000
Oh, no one.
I just, um,

1:10:39.069 --> 1:10:40.568
I wanted to look at
the news and see if

1:10:40.604 --> 1:10:42.103
maybe they caught
Rafael or something.

1:10:42.138 --> 1:10:43.871
-Hey, maybe there's
something on the air.

1:10:43.907 --> 1:10:45.340
Let's have
a look.

1:10:45.408 --> 1:10:47.008

worry about it.

okay, forget about it.

Mm. Actually
though, I am..

1:10:59.289 --> 1:11:00.688
I have to pee
really badly,

1:11:00.757 --> 1:11:02.657
could-could we pull
over there, please?

1:11:02.759 --> 1:11:04.459
That's not
a bad idea.

1:11:04.494 --> 1:11:06.794
Hemingway probably
has to pee too.

1:11:06.830 --> 1:11:07.762
-Okay.

1:11:20.777 --> 1:11:23.044
I'm coming with you just
to make sure it's safe.

1:11:23.179 --> 1:11:24.912
Uh, okay.

1:11:26.616 --> 1:11:30.251
Come on, Hemingway.
Let's go. Gotta pee?

1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:39.427
You're good. You want
me to wait for you?

1:11:39.462 --> 1:11:41.095
Oh, no, that's-that's
totally fine. Thank you.

we're there?

need to talk to-

-We really should get
you inside to the cabin.

with Hemingway.

some help, actually.

find you out here.

just so happens

for one too.

right back.

worse without you here.

hear that because....

know I haven't known you

been a couple of months,

1:16:30.153 --> 1:16:31.285
I know that.

we've gotten pretty close

of months, yeah?

because of what we're

going through,
I don't know.

1:16:45.168 --> 1:16:53.541
But, what I do know is I
don't want to lose you

1:16:53.643 --> 1:16:55.810
and that I
love you.

1:17:20.703 --> 1:17:25.039
of course I-I feel
the same way, I do,

1:17:25.074 --> 1:17:27.675
it's just there's-
there's so much

1:17:27.710 --> 1:17:32.713
going on in my life right
now, I don't know if I-I...

1:17:32.749 --> 1:17:35.082
Of course, of
course I love you.

me because of him,

No, I do. I will.

you bring champagne?

we stopped pretending?

you mean?

talking about?

don't you think?

Oh my god. No.

You know
what's funny?

You knew I was looking
for you all along

1:20:01.364 --> 1:20:04.131
but you fell in
love with me again.

1:20:04.167 --> 1:20:08.235

name, your identity,

1:20:08.371 --> 1:20:10.271
you moved
around the country

1:20:10.373 --> 1:20:14.542
and still you fell
in love with me.

1:20:14.577 --> 1:20:16.343
Again.

1:20:16.379 --> 1:20:17.344
Shh.

1:20:17.380 --> 1:20:19.280
No! Please don't!
please! please!

1:20:19.382 --> 1:20:20.581
Please!

1:20:20.683 --> 1:20:24.118
Please don't
do this.

1:20:24.220 --> 1:20:26.353
I've gotta tell you,
the last couple of months

1:20:26.389 --> 1:20:29.323
have been very,
very precious to me.

1:20:29.358 --> 1:20:32.193
You were so
suspicious.

1:20:32.228 --> 1:20:34.695
You were so withdrawn,

1:20:34.730 --> 1:20:38.465
yet day by day you
opened up to me.

1:20:38.568 --> 1:20:40.034
You did.

1:20:40.069 --> 1:20:41.635
But still I wasn't
sure what you were

1:20:41.737 --> 1:20:43.337
gonna say when
I asked you.

1:20:43.372 --> 1:20:45.372
But when you
said yes...

1:20:49.545 --> 1:20:57.618
that's a memory that you
and will share forever.

1:20:57.720 --> 1:21:00.721
Actually, it's a
shame this has to end..

1:21:02.592 --> 1:21:03.824
but most
things do.

1:21:03.926 --> 1:21:05.826
[clanking]
Auugh!

1:21:05.928 --> 1:21:16.503
[fast
suspenseful music]

1:21:16.606 --> 1:21:18.505
Violet!

1:21:18.608 --> 1:21:19.640
Wake up!

1:21:19.742 --> 1:21:21.809
Violet, wake up!

1:21:21.944 --> 1:21:24.912
Baby? Baby?

1:21:24.947 --> 1:21:26.680
-Camille?
[knocking on door]

1:21:26.782 --> 1:21:28.315
Violet!

1:21:28.417 --> 1:21:29.850
-Open the door!

1:21:29.952 --> 1:21:32.052
[banging]

1:21:34.624 --> 1:21:35.723
Violet!

1:21:35.758 --> 1:21:40.661
[door crashes open]

1:21:40.763 --> 1:21:43.464
[door slams shut]

1:21:43.499 --> 1:21:45.799
[gasping
and crying]

1:21:45.835 --> 1:21:49.536
You are really ruining
a wonderful moment.

1:21:49.639 --> 1:21:51.105
Please...

1:21:55.611 --> 1:22:01.715
Don't make me do anything
you're gonna regret.

1:22:01.817 --> 1:22:05.686
Do not hurt her!
Do not hurt her,

1:22:05.788 --> 1:22:09.223
I will do anything you
want me to, please.

1:22:09.325 --> 1:22:12.426
Please.. please.

1:22:12.461 --> 1:22:20.434
[suspenseful music]

1:22:20.469 --> 1:22:22.002
[spraying]

1:22:22.038 --> 1:22:24.705
Auuugh! [bangs
against the door]

1:22:24.807 --> 1:22:26.407
[cutting sound]

1:22:26.509 --> 1:22:28.876
Ugh.. Uhh..
[gasping]

1:22:29.011 --> 1:22:36.550
[blood dripping
to the floor]

1:22:36.652 --> 1:22:38.118
[thud]
