WEBVTT

00:04.352 --> 00:06.310
Long distance is hard.

00:06.354 --> 00:08.312
<i>Our stars just didn't align.</i>

00:08.356 --> 00:11.837
But Matt, maybe someday.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.883
- I'm good to go, Lieutenant.
- Negative, Carver!

00:13.926 --> 00:15.406
You stay here.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.147
Carver's capable
of much more than that.

00:17.191 --> 00:18.453
Let me lead him.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.237
I'm so stoked to be at 51

00:20.281 --> 00:23.066
to show you the kind
of firefighter I am.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.502
Thought you were
done with me.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.330
Well, is there any way
to stop the transfer?

00:26.374 --> 00:28.028
He is actually
happy about it,

00:28.071 --> 00:32.423
since it means we don't have to
hide our relationship anymore.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.998
You're a lot of fun, Blake.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.608
So are you.

00:43.652 --> 00:44.566
Maybe too much.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.263
I'm gonna be way late for work.

00:46.307 --> 00:49.397
Okay, we are getting
dressed for real this time.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.182
We should do this again,
but no pressure.

00:52.226 --> 00:53.488
- Yeah.
- Seriously.

00:53.531 --> 00:56.186
Yeah, yeah, definitely.
That would be great.

00:56.230 --> 01:00.060
Well, I'm out of your hair.

01:00.103 --> 01:03.150
Your very cute hair.

01:03.193 --> 01:04.716
It was really nice
meeting you.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.892
Hmm.

01:06.936 --> 01:08.068
See ya.

01:13.595 --> 01:15.727
Uh-oh.

01:22.691 --> 01:25.563
Javi, you playing hooky
or something?

01:25.607 --> 01:28.523
- Hooky?
- Skipping school. Don't do it.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.916
And no, his grade's got
a Friday, Monday off thing,

01:30.960 --> 01:33.397
so he's hanging with us
for the next two shifts.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.660
I know.
Chief's waiting for him.

01:35.704 --> 01:38.968
Oh, hey, come on.

01:39.011 --> 01:41.231
- Joe.
- Sir.

01:41.275 --> 01:43.146
It's my understanding that we
have a new candidate reporting

01:43.190 --> 01:45.322
for his first shift today.
- Yes, sir.

01:45.366 --> 01:48.586
Javi Sandoval
reporting for duty.

01:48.630 --> 01:49.805
Hello.

01:49.848 --> 01:53.156
Hello, Chief Boden.

01:55.637 --> 01:57.682
You may proceed with
your duties, candidate.

01:57.726 --> 02:01.904
I'll be by to inspect
in about 15 minutes.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.906
Yes, Chief. We're on it.

02:03.949 --> 02:06.256
I should hope so.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.562
What are my duties?

02:07.605 --> 02:09.259
Oh, this is very serious.

02:09.303 --> 02:11.261
You have to make
blueberry pancakes

02:11.305 --> 02:13.089
for the entire firehouse, huh?

02:13.133 --> 02:14.830
Yeah. Let's go, let's go.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.005
Hey, candidate in the house.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.226
- Looking good!
- There he is.

02:19.269 --> 02:20.792
Looking good!

02:34.980 --> 02:36.765
Um, hey.

02:36.808 --> 02:39.289
So I was thinking about
our next paramedicine shift.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.117
Morning, Brett.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.337
Sorry.
Good morning, Mouch.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.599
I couldn't sleep last night,
and I started thinking

02:44.642 --> 02:46.296
about our list of patients.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.124
And I noticed that
a bunch of our patients

02:48.168 --> 02:50.213
would really benefit
from an extra visit or two,

02:50.257 --> 02:51.954
so I put together
a new schedule.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.872
Oh.
This is a lot of visits.

02:56.915 --> 03:00.092
Oh, well, if you don't have
the time, I totally understand.

03:00.136 --> 03:02.660
I can do some of these
on my own.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.186
You know what?

03:06.229 --> 03:07.839
This is fine.

03:07.883 --> 03:09.754
I'll just push my
pipe band rehearsal.

03:09.798 --> 03:12.714
I've been appointed pipe major,
so I do all the scheduling.

03:12.757 --> 03:13.758
Congratulations.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.325
Thank you.

03:15.369 --> 03:17.675
<i>Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61.</i>

03:17.719 --> 03:22.289
<i>Person trapped, 863 Racine.</i>

03:36.781 --> 03:38.914
- What happened?
- We hit a power line.

03:38.957 --> 03:41.525
The operator took a big jolt.
He's not looking too good.

03:41.569 --> 03:43.135
All right, just make sure
your guys stay back.

03:43.179 --> 03:45.399
Yeah, we're not touching
that machine, we're not idiots.

03:45.442 --> 03:46.530
I'm not talking about
just the machine.

03:46.574 --> 03:49.881
It's--hey! Hey, stop!

03:49.925 --> 03:52.275
Don't take another step.

03:52.319 --> 03:53.624
All right,
the ground is energized.

03:53.668 --> 03:55.409
Let's set a perimeter
of 30 feet.

03:55.452 --> 03:56.714
All right, Cruz, let's get
this guy out of here.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.281
He's way too close.
- Copy that.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.978
Hey, hey, buddy.
Don't move yet, okay?

04:00.022 --> 04:01.980
I'm gonna talk you through this
step by step, okay?

04:02.024 --> 04:03.765
I want you to walk
towards me one step at a time.

04:03.808 --> 04:06.246
But make sure you only
put down one foot at once.

04:06.289 --> 04:07.595
Hey.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.074
Has anybody called
the power company?

04:09.118 --> 04:10.598
Yeah, they said they're
sending somebody out.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.643
No, we can't wait.
He needs medical attention now.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.297
I--I thought he was supposed
to be safe inside the rig.

04:14.341 --> 04:17.213
No, the metal cage is used
to divert electrical currents.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.041
He takes one step outside,
it's like a lightning bolt

04:19.084 --> 04:20.303
coming up through the ground.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.652
The potential
around that excavator

04:21.696 --> 04:24.568
has got to be a few
thousand volts, at least.

04:24.612 --> 04:25.917
The aerial.
Let's bring it in.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.005
We'll drop in from above.

04:27.049 --> 04:28.398
All right, Mouch,
bring 81 closer.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.407
Good.

04:37.451 --> 04:38.582
Hey, all right.
I got you.

04:38.626 --> 04:39.931
You're good. You're good.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.542
What the hell
were you thinking?

04:41.585 --> 04:43.283
I can't just leave
Andre out there.

04:43.326 --> 04:44.849
You know, we're like family.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.198
Let's just clear out,
all right?

04:46.242 --> 04:47.722
Let us worry about Andre.

04:51.813 --> 04:54.119
Is that Andre Kearns
in the excavator?

04:54.163 --> 04:56.905
Yeah, do you know him?

04:56.948 --> 04:58.341
I sure do.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.919
All right, Gallo, Carver,
once you're done here,

05:10.962 --> 05:12.181
squad needs a hand.

05:12.224 --> 05:13.443
Copy that.

05:22.234 --> 05:24.541
- Grab that.
- Sounds good.

05:32.244 --> 05:34.421
Okay, take him up.

06:04.712 --> 06:07.105
All right, hold here!
I'm clipping.

06:07.149 --> 06:09.064
We're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

06:09.107 --> 06:10.500
Can you stand?

06:10.544 --> 06:12.154
- I don't know.
- Lower down a little.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.464
All right, hang on, buddy.
Doing great.

06:22.773 --> 06:25.210
All right, Carver, we're gonna
do this one at a time.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.429
On my go.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.170
Just relax, okay? Look at me.

06:28.213 --> 06:30.215
You're not gonna have to
do a thing, all right?

06:30.259 --> 06:31.521
Let's get you up.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.921
Severide, you gotta
get out of there now!

06:44.665 --> 06:48.233
All right, new plan!
We're coming out together.

06:48.277 --> 06:49.539
In ten seconds.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.498
All right, we're gonna
fly you out of here, man.

06:51.541 --> 06:54.675
All right, Carver,
tighten up the slack.

06:54.718 --> 06:56.241
You can do it.
Come on, brother.

06:56.285 --> 06:57.982
All right, Mouch, take us up.

07:09.690 --> 07:12.736
Hey, quick right!

07:12.780 --> 07:15.304
Carver, you good?

07:15.347 --> 07:16.697
I got it.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.615
Keep going, Mouch!

07:29.318 --> 07:31.233
Okay, bring 'em down.

07:40.372 --> 07:41.461
You all right?

07:41.504 --> 07:42.940
Yeah, I'm good.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.510
Got it.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.860
- Hey, one, two, three.

07:54.212 --> 07:56.476
- We good?
- Yep.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.303
Brett, Violet,
take good care of him.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.610
He's got a family back home.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.307
Yeah, we will.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.801
- What do we got?
- High-voltage shock.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.063
He's slipping in and out
of consciousness.

08:19.107 --> 08:20.369
Elevated heart rate,
erratic pulse,

08:20.412 --> 08:22.066
severe electrical burns
on his extremities.

08:22.110 --> 08:24.591
Let's get him to Trauma 3.

08:24.634 --> 08:26.244
Should we stay a bit,
see how he does?

08:26.288 --> 08:29.204
Yeah, let's do it.
Carver seemed pretty concerned.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.119
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Chief.

08:31.162 --> 08:32.468
Hey, there.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.297
I'm late for a meeting,
but check your email.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.299
I sent you some pictures
of the B&B.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.000
B&B?

08:43.044 --> 08:45.829
Yeah, we are--we're going
to Lake Geneva for the weekend.

08:45.873 --> 08:47.352
Oh.

08:47.396 --> 08:49.354
I know you and Casey
travel together all the time,

08:49.398 --> 08:50.530
but this is our first trip,

08:50.573 --> 08:52.967
and I'm actually
a little nervous.

08:57.101 --> 08:59.016
Don't be--you guys
are gonna have a blast.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.324
Oh, my God.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.935
Check this place out.
The Bradford House.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.110
Even the name is swank.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.547
Mm, it's so pretty.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.026
Yeah.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.550
Good job.

09:22.518 --> 09:25.086
- Hey! How's our candidate?
- We're vibing.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.870
I was told I can't
sit at the squad table

09:26.914 --> 09:28.219
until I make squad.

09:28.263 --> 09:30.004
They told you right.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.135
How was the fire?

09:31.179 --> 09:32.659
Oh, it wasn't
a fire, actually.

09:32.702 --> 09:35.183
But a man did hit a power line
at a construction site,

09:35.226 --> 09:37.489
and Severide saved him.
- Oh!

09:37.533 --> 09:39.622
That's no way
to tell a story, Cruz.

09:39.666 --> 09:42.277
Javi, you see that
aerial ladder right there?

09:42.320 --> 09:45.628
Well, it was extended
all the way out,

09:45.672 --> 09:48.500
and Severide, he was dangling
from the end of it

09:48.544 --> 09:51.721
like "Mission: Impossible"
so that he could swing it

09:51.765 --> 09:53.331
over a field of lava.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.811
There was no lava.

09:54.855 --> 09:59.250
And he had to lower himself
down into a tiny spot

09:59.294 --> 10:00.817
the size of a postage stamp.

10:00.861 --> 10:05.126
There were sparks flying,
electricity crackling.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.519
And the driver? Trapped.

10:07.563 --> 10:10.000
One wrong move, and no one's
getting out of there alive.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.263
But Severide? He's Severide.

10:12.307 --> 10:14.788
So he lifts the guy up
with one arm

10:14.831 --> 10:16.833
and swings him back to safety.

10:16.877 --> 10:20.010
Bam, Superman.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.838
Awesome.

10:21.882 --> 10:24.014
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie.

10:24.058 --> 10:26.930
It was definitely awesome.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.105
What did you do, Joe?

10:29.629 --> 10:33.110
Uh, I--I had to get
the ropes ready.

10:33.154 --> 10:34.808
Candidate?

10:34.851 --> 10:36.331
Where's our ham sandwiches?

10:44.078 --> 10:46.341
Carver?

10:46.384 --> 10:48.430
You knew the victim?

10:48.473 --> 10:50.693
I used to work with him.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.260
Oh, we've had a lot of
firefighters work construction

10:52.303 --> 10:54.784
as a second gig.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.699
And you still do it?

10:56.743 --> 10:58.135
Here and there.

11:01.269 --> 11:03.401
Andre was my first crew chief.

11:03.445 --> 11:04.533
He took me under his wing,
taught me

11:04.576 --> 11:06.230
how to drive
a front-end loader.

11:06.274 --> 11:07.710
He's a good guy.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.016
Hey.

11:09.059 --> 11:10.147
Thanks for helping out
on the ropes, Carvin.

11:10.191 --> 11:11.845
Carver.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.198
Ouch. Gotta be more careful.

11:17.241 --> 11:19.374
Well, you guys rigged me to
hoist it one person at a time,

11:19.417 --> 11:21.158
then Lieutenant Severide
got creative.

11:21.202 --> 11:24.074
He likes to do that.

11:24.118 --> 11:25.293
Where'd you get that?

11:28.296 --> 11:31.342
Come on.
Every scar tells a story.

11:31.386 --> 11:32.822
A house fire in Pilsen.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.737
Didn't realize I had a rip
in my bunker coat.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.913
Next thing you know--

11:36.957 --> 11:38.436
Hmm.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.787
Maybe not every scar.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.095
Have the paramedics
take a look at that wrist

11:45.139 --> 11:46.923
when they get back, yeah?

11:46.967 --> 11:47.924
Copy.

11:59.196 --> 12:01.503
That was pretty risky,

12:01.546 --> 12:03.200
doubling up on the rope
like that.

12:03.244 --> 12:07.117
Well, the bigger risk
was staying put.

12:07.161 --> 12:08.597
All worked out.

12:08.640 --> 12:12.209
Yeah, because
Carver saved your ass.

12:12.253 --> 12:14.516
He nearly pulled his arm out
of the socket

12:14.559 --> 12:18.041
trying to pull you up,
but he wouldn't let go.

12:18.085 --> 12:19.173
I owe him a beer.

12:20.957 --> 12:24.091
Boden might just be
right about this guy.

12:24.134 --> 12:25.745
It's so annoying.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.407
What are you doing to me?

12:38.322 --> 12:40.237
What are you--

12:46.026 --> 12:47.767
What are you doing to me?

12:51.248 --> 12:52.772
Okay.

12:52.815 --> 12:59.169
Let's--we will--let's
pick this up at--at home?

13:06.046 --> 13:07.264
Hey, guys.

13:07.308 --> 13:08.918
What's the word on Andre?

13:08.962 --> 13:09.876
He gonna be all right?

13:23.411 --> 13:24.542
What was that?

13:26.501 --> 13:28.416
His friend from the
construction site,

13:28.459 --> 13:31.375
he's got severe
electrical burns.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.856
They have to amputate
his leg.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.475
- What's this do?
- Ignition switch.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.347
It starts the engine.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.175
Don't press it.

13:52.222 --> 13:54.137
Hey. Pull this.

14:01.492 --> 14:03.277
All right, candidate.
Come on. Time to go.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.975
Time to go. Ah. Here.

14:06.019 --> 14:09.631
Hey, when Chloe asks you
how it went, be sure

14:09.674 --> 14:12.677
and not tell her how you
pranked people all shift, okay?

14:12.721 --> 14:16.594
- Very important lesson.
- Bah!

14:16.638 --> 14:17.857
Great to have you here, candidate.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.162
Thank you.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.903
Hey, that's a lieutenant
you're addressing.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.687
Thank you, Lieutenant.

14:22.731 --> 14:23.950
You're back next shift?

14:23.993 --> 14:25.429
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

14:25.473 --> 14:26.996
We're gonna put on some gear
and run zero visibility

14:27.040 --> 14:28.128
dummy drills, all right?

14:28.171 --> 14:29.520
Think you can handle that?

14:29.564 --> 14:31.392
Yes, sir.

14:31.435 --> 14:32.915
Dismissed.

14:38.790 --> 14:41.750
Severide is so cool.

14:41.793 --> 14:45.232
Yeah, he gets that a lot.

14:50.585 --> 14:51.673
Uh-oh.

14:51.716 --> 14:52.717
What's wrong?

14:52.761 --> 14:56.025
I--I got bad news.

14:56.069 --> 14:59.159
We have to postpone
our trip to Lake Geneva.

14:59.202 --> 15:01.465
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.990
Just--I have this paramedic
conference in Waukegan

15:04.033 --> 15:06.035
they want me to go to,
and given my current standing

15:06.079 --> 15:09.038
with DC Hill,
I couldn't say no.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.433
I'm so sorry.

15:12.476 --> 15:16.176
Don't be.
No, it's--it's not your fault.

15:18.743 --> 15:19.919
We'll go another time.

15:21.355 --> 15:22.269
Yeah.

15:25.011 --> 15:28.884
Carver, you make sure
you change out that bandage.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.365
I don't need you sidelined
with an infection.

15:31.408 --> 15:32.844
Will do, Lieutenant.

15:32.888 --> 15:36.631
Are you gonna check up
on your friend at Med?

15:36.674 --> 15:39.503
I am. Headed there right now.

15:39.547 --> 15:42.202
You remember how Chief Malloy
used to always tell our class,

15:42.245 --> 15:44.073
leave it all on the scene?

15:44.117 --> 15:46.162
Don't bring it back
to the firehouse?

15:46.206 --> 15:47.294
Yeah.

15:49.426 --> 15:52.081
Well, that's not how
we do things here at 51.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.433
Mind if I tag along?

15:58.653 --> 15:59.567
Sure.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.227
Huh, your blood pressure's
a little higher

16:07.270 --> 16:08.968
than our last visit, Warren.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.143
But you feel okay?

16:10.186 --> 16:13.233
Sure. I'm doing good.

16:14.930 --> 16:17.715
These feel
a little full to me.

16:17.759 --> 16:20.196
You've still been taking
your medication, haven't you?

16:23.460 --> 16:25.462
Fill date's pretty old.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.116
I have more.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.553
Where?
Are they in the bathroom?

16:29.597 --> 16:32.034
No, my sister has them.

16:32.078 --> 16:35.559
Oh, is Stephanie here?
'Cause I'd love to talk to her.

16:35.603 --> 16:41.043
She's at work right now,
but she'll be home later.

16:41.087 --> 16:45.395
Okay, Warren, well,
we have to go now,

16:45.439 --> 16:47.789
but I'm gonna call your sister
and set up a time that we can

16:47.832 --> 16:49.530
come back when she's here, okay?

16:49.573 --> 16:52.185
Okay.

16:52.228 --> 16:54.361
All right,
we'll see you soon.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.064
He's low energy,
but he does go up and down.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.197
What happens if he
doesn't take his meds?

17:04.240 --> 17:05.807
He's been on it for a while,

17:05.850 --> 17:07.287
so there would be
symptoms of withdrawal--

17:07.330 --> 17:10.855
insomnia, anxiety,
psychosis, among others.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.509
We would probably know.

17:12.553 --> 17:15.295
I'll get it straightened out
when I talk to Stephanie.

17:15.338 --> 17:17.688
Oh, I forgot to mention,
I made sandwiches,

17:17.732 --> 17:19.908
so we can go right to the next
patient instead of stopping.

17:19.951 --> 17:21.170
But I like lunch breaks.

17:21.214 --> 17:23.216
We eat and drive
and save time.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.317
Are you Rita?

17:37.360 --> 17:39.232
- Yes.
- We're firefighters.

17:39.275 --> 17:40.929
We were on the scene
of the accident.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.932
And I, uh--

17:43.975 --> 17:46.761
I actually used
to work with Andre.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.110
I'm Sam Carver.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.285
This is my lieutenant,
Stella Kidd.

17:49.329 --> 17:50.721
Hi.

17:50.765 --> 17:53.942
Thank you for helping him.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.074
Sounds like it could have been

17:55.117 --> 17:56.292
a lot worse
if you weren't there.

18:02.255 --> 18:04.344
He woke up from surgery,
and all he could think about

18:04.387 --> 18:07.347
was what was this
gonna cost us.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.871
You don't need to worry
about that right now.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.394
That's what worker's comp
is for.

18:11.438 --> 18:14.223
I'm not sure
that's gonna help.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.704
The company is blaming Andre
for the accident,

18:16.747 --> 18:18.445
and if he's found negligent,

18:18.488 --> 18:20.795
insurance is gonna
deny his claim.

18:20.838 --> 18:22.840
Wait, they're blaming Andre?

18:22.884 --> 18:25.104
They said he wasn't digging
where he was supposed to.

18:27.236 --> 18:29.760
That doesn't sound
like the Andre I know.

18:29.804 --> 18:32.720
He's a "measure twice,
cut once" kind of guy.

18:32.763 --> 18:35.897
Five years with this company,

18:35.940 --> 18:38.247
and they're treating him
like some kind of criminal.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.293
Nobody's visited him.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.951
They didn't even bother
to send flowers.

18:58.006 --> 19:00.269
Poor guy.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.836
Yeah, I don't get it.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.403
Foreman on the scene,

19:03.446 --> 19:04.708
he was risking his neck
to get to Andre.

19:04.752 --> 19:05.970
Said he was like family.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.189
Now he won't even
pay him a visit?

19:09.235 --> 19:10.584
This doesn't make sense.

19:10.627 --> 19:13.282
Andre's good at his job,
a total pro.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.680
He's getting railroaded.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.779
Wa-ho! Look who's back.

19:31.822 --> 19:34.651
Most candidates wash out
after day one, kid.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.740
We never see them again.

19:36.784 --> 19:38.786
Good to know we got
a real smoke eater here.

19:38.829 --> 19:41.745
Yeah, Severide is gonna take
him through some drills today.

19:41.789 --> 19:44.444
- He can handle it.
- Oh, don't I know it?

19:44.487 --> 19:46.010
He's been talking
about it nonstop.

19:51.929 --> 19:52.930
Whoa.

19:57.631 --> 20:00.068
Hey! Candidate's back.

20:00.111 --> 20:01.939
I'm ready for you, Lieutenant.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.767
All right, well,
first thing you can do

20:03.811 --> 20:06.248
is get over here and grab
my bag out of the back seat.

20:08.424 --> 20:09.947
Chop, chop.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.386
Don't worry
about it, brother.

20:13.429 --> 20:15.910
Same thing happened
with my kids.

20:15.953 --> 20:19.609
You can't compete
with Severide.

20:19.653 --> 20:22.003
Nobody can.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.492
Hey.

20:36.887 --> 20:40.717
How's it going with that dude
with the Egyptian tattoos?

20:40.761 --> 20:42.371
- Alex?
- Yeah.

20:42.415 --> 20:43.981
That ended, like,
a month ago.

20:44.025 --> 20:45.331
What about that guy
from LaGrange

20:45.374 --> 20:48.247
who texted you "sure"
with no exclamation point?

20:48.290 --> 20:52.512
So you thought
maybe it was sarcastic.

20:52.555 --> 20:55.254
Gallo, I know
what you're doing.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.867
Whenever you want to talk
about your love life,

20:59.910 --> 21:02.348
you ask me questions
about mine as a segue.

21:02.391 --> 21:03.871
So just come out with it, man.

21:03.914 --> 21:06.308
Okay, I met this girl
the other night at Brink's.

21:06.352 --> 21:09.616
When you were avoiding seeing
Violet and Hawkins at Molly's?

21:11.357 --> 21:15.535
And she's pretty wild, fun.

21:15.578 --> 21:19.974
But I know there's not,
like, a serious future there.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.280
So keep it casual, then.

21:23.456 --> 21:26.459
The problem is, Ritter,
women fall in love with me,

21:26.502 --> 21:29.157
and it's--and it can get complicated.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.333
Gallo, whether or not
you want to admit it,

21:31.377 --> 21:33.335
you need a distraction
right now from this whole

21:33.379 --> 21:34.945
Violet and Hawkins thing, okay?

21:34.989 --> 21:40.124
So call this wild woman up
and have some fun.

21:43.998 --> 21:45.521
Carver?

21:45.565 --> 21:47.697
- Hey, Lieutenant.
- Hey.

21:49.351 --> 21:52.354
I made a few phone calls,
dropped some CFD lingo.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.878
I managed to get a copy
of the accident report

21:54.922 --> 21:57.533
filed by Andre's employers
to their insurance company.

21:57.577 --> 21:58.882
Nice.

21:58.926 --> 22:00.971
It doesn't look good
for your friend.

22:01.015 --> 22:02.321
The company had someone
from the city

22:02.364 --> 22:04.235
come out and mark that
underground power line

22:04.279 --> 22:08.065
before they started work,
per code requirement.

22:08.109 --> 22:10.677
But Andre didn't
heed the flags.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.069
Says who?

22:12.113 --> 22:16.160
The foreman,
backed by the rest of the crew.

22:16.204 --> 22:18.728
They're calling it
operator error.

22:24.691 --> 22:27.346
Look, it--

22:27.389 --> 22:30.261
it happens.

22:30.305 --> 22:31.654
People make mistakes.

22:31.698 --> 22:33.830
But this is the rookiest
of mistakes.

22:33.874 --> 22:35.789
And Andre is no rookie.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.834
The city must have
marked it wrong.

22:37.878 --> 22:39.923
Their paperwork is in there.

22:39.967 --> 22:42.796
And it looks
pretty thorough to me.

22:48.105 --> 22:51.718
I can't tell from this.
I'd have to see it in person.

22:51.761 --> 22:53.850
Lieutenant, I know
this is a big ask,

22:53.894 --> 22:56.113
but they're gonna
release the scene as soon

22:56.157 --> 22:58.333
as the insurance company
rules on this.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.163
After shift might be too late.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.519
Hey.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.434
So I was thinking for our
next paramedicine shift,

23:12.478 --> 23:15.611
I'll add Warren in
even though it's not his day.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.265
Will his sister be home?

23:17.308 --> 23:19.049
I don't know.
She hasn't called me back.

23:19.093 --> 23:20.660
But it's fine to add
another visit, right?

23:20.703 --> 23:22.052
That day's not too long.

23:22.096 --> 23:26.970
Well, it's almost twice
as long as we're used to.

23:27.014 --> 23:29.016
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, Mouch.

23:29.059 --> 23:31.148
I'm being selfish adding
all these new rounds.

23:31.192 --> 23:33.542
And you have Trudy
to get home to and a life.

23:33.586 --> 23:35.805
That's not the problem.

23:35.849 --> 23:37.764
It's you I'm worried about.

23:37.807 --> 23:39.026
What?

23:39.069 --> 23:41.985
You haven't slowed down
even for a breath

23:42.029 --> 23:43.770
the last three days.

23:47.774 --> 23:50.646
Um...

23:50.690 --> 23:52.648
Casey and I broke up.

23:55.651 --> 23:59.481
And I'm--I'm still processing.

23:59.525 --> 24:01.483
Just working things out
in my head, you know?

24:01.527 --> 24:03.354
So I haven't told anyone yet.

24:03.398 --> 24:05.313
Well, I'm so sorry.

24:05.356 --> 24:07.750
Yeah, me too. Um...

24:10.536 --> 24:12.363
We don't have to add Warren
to the schedule tomorrow,

24:12.407 --> 24:15.062
and I can rearrange
and shorten the day.

24:15.105 --> 24:20.850
No, let's keep that schedule
for as long as you need.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.722
Trudy's happy
to have some alone time.

24:22.765 --> 24:25.159
Trust me.

24:25.202 --> 24:28.467
Let's roll, Mouch.
We're taking 81 out for a ride.

24:40.914 --> 24:43.699
Red flags marked
the power line?

24:43.743 --> 24:44.918
Yeah.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.098
They're small flags.

24:51.141 --> 24:52.839
I can see how
he could have missed them.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.539
All right, come on.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.498
Let's get back to the house.

25:13.207 --> 25:15.252
Lieutenant, you see this?

25:18.865 --> 25:20.475
What about it?

25:22.477 --> 25:25.480
This is where we staged the
truck for the aerial rescue.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.439
This flag wasn't put here
till after we were gone.

25:31.834 --> 25:34.271
Help you guys with something?

25:34.315 --> 25:37.013
- Yeah, who moved these flags?
- I'm sorry, what's that?

25:37.057 --> 25:39.842
This flag wasn't here
the other day.

25:39.886 --> 25:41.278
Sure it was.

25:41.322 --> 25:42.497
Really?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.107
Does it look like it had
40,000 pounds

25:44.151 --> 25:46.240
of fire truck sitting on top
of it?

25:46.283 --> 25:49.504
'Cause this is where we parked.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.767
Do you guys have
some official purpose

25:51.811 --> 25:53.116
for being here
I don't know about?

25:53.160 --> 25:54.204
We were just
coming by to take

25:54.248 --> 25:55.858
another look at the scene.

25:55.902 --> 25:57.338
Well, you've had it.

25:57.381 --> 25:59.035
Now, if you don't mind
clearing off my jobsite,

25:59.079 --> 26:01.168
I got to get my guys
back to work.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.956
That man is lying.

26:18.838 --> 26:21.188
Shouldn't you be
on your way to Waukegan?

26:21.231 --> 26:22.711
Wanted to drop off some
paramedicine paperwork

26:22.755 --> 26:24.844
to Brett first.
- Mm.

26:24.887 --> 26:26.715
Probably the last chance
I get since, uh,

26:26.759 --> 26:28.935
I only have two more shifts
left in the district.

26:31.851 --> 26:34.897
Yeah, right.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.290
What's wrong?

26:39.032 --> 26:40.773
All of this.

26:40.816 --> 26:42.383
It is my fault.

26:42.426 --> 26:43.689
What?

26:43.732 --> 26:45.125
Yeah, the district change,
the fact that

26:45.168 --> 26:48.345
you have to go above
and beyond to please DC Hill.

26:48.389 --> 26:50.609
Fine, fine.

26:50.652 --> 26:54.830
We, you and I,
made the irrational decision

26:54.874 --> 26:59.139
to get together
despite all the pitfalls.

26:59.182 --> 27:00.662
Would you change any of it?

27:00.706 --> 27:03.534
Because I wouldn't change
a second of it.

27:06.712 --> 27:09.845
These last few days have been
some of the best of my life,

27:09.889 --> 27:12.456
even with the
stupid conference.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.676
We will get to the
Bradford House soon enough

27:14.720 --> 27:18.201
and plenty of other places too.

27:18.245 --> 27:19.550
Yeah.

27:29.038 --> 27:30.083
All right, candidate.

27:30.126 --> 27:31.693
- Let's go.
- Come on, candidate.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.086
You got this, papito.
You got this.

27:33.129 --> 27:34.696
Okay.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.437
There you go, papi,
there you go.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.352
- Stay low. <i>
- Andale, papi, andale!</i>

27:38.395 --> 27:39.788
Let's move, candidate.
Ten seconds.

27:39.832 --> 27:41.703
You got this! <i>
Andale!</i> Let's go!

27:41.747 --> 27:43.139
Nine.

27:43.183 --> 27:44.663
- Come on!
- Eight.

27:44.706 --> 27:47.666
<i>Vamos, vamos, vamos, vamos!</i>
You got this.

27:47.709 --> 27:51.104
Seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one.

27:51.147 --> 27:53.497
Hey!

27:53.541 --> 27:55.108
Well, Javi,
there you have it.

27:55.151 --> 27:57.980
You've officially done the
dummy pull faster than Capp.

27:58.024 --> 27:59.678
And that's what we call
in the firehouse

27:59.721 --> 28:01.462
a weak attempt at busting ba--

28:01.505 --> 28:03.638
Okay, no more lessons.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.727
So who has the record time?

28:05.771 --> 28:07.381
That would be Severide.

28:07.424 --> 28:08.730
Academy record too.

28:08.774 --> 28:11.385
18 years, never been broken.

28:11.428 --> 28:12.647
Nice.

28:16.477 --> 28:17.608
Hey, come on.

28:21.743 --> 28:25.007
You want to hear something
better than academy training?

28:25.051 --> 28:26.356
Yeah, I do.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.708
All right, well,
a few years back,

28:29.751 --> 28:32.014
the squad goes
on a house fire call.

28:32.058 --> 28:34.147
And I'm right near a chimney
when the whole thing

28:34.190 --> 28:35.626
falls right down on top of me.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.979
The fire's moving in.

28:40.022 --> 28:44.070
Can't move,
underneath a pile of bricks.

28:44.113 --> 28:47.508
Just when I think things
can't get any worse,

28:47.551 --> 28:50.032
the floor starts to fail.

28:50.076 --> 28:53.688
Joe was there,
but our captain on scene

28:53.732 --> 28:55.081
wanted everyone to leave.

28:55.124 --> 28:56.735
It was too dangerous.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.171
"Save yourself," he said.

29:00.913 --> 29:03.263
You know what Joe Cruz did?

29:03.306 --> 29:05.047
He didn't leave.

29:05.091 --> 29:08.616
He went out, and he found
a big piece of wood.

29:08.659 --> 29:11.401
And he used it to lever
the chimney in order

29:11.445 --> 29:13.229
for me to get out.

29:13.273 --> 29:14.796
All by himself.

29:17.799 --> 29:20.889
So I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for Joe Cruz.

29:23.152 --> 29:25.546
That's the truth.

29:25.589 --> 29:26.939
Same.

29:26.982 --> 29:29.376
He caught me
when I fell out a window.

29:29.419 --> 29:30.725
I remember.

29:33.293 --> 29:34.598
Joe's my hero.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.179
Hey.

29:50.223 --> 29:53.095
You get in contact
with your contractor friend?

29:53.139 --> 29:54.705
Sure did.

29:54.749 --> 29:56.707
He says that company
only cares about one thing--

29:56.751 --> 29:58.057
profit margins.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.102
They've never met
a safety regulation

30:00.146 --> 30:02.539
or environmental law
they wouldn't trample.

30:02.583 --> 30:03.976
Even at the risk
of hitting a power line?

30:04.019 --> 30:05.804
If it cost too much
to avoid the power line,

30:05.847 --> 30:07.849
they'll just cheat it
a little bit.

30:07.893 --> 30:10.634
You know, nudge the flags a few
feet and cross their fingers

30:10.678 --> 30:13.202
the diggers don't clip a wire.

30:13.246 --> 30:16.945
So when we pulled up
the other day

30:16.989 --> 30:19.818
and the foreman was treading
across the energized ground,

30:19.861 --> 30:21.863
he was probably moving
those flags back

30:21.907 --> 30:24.648
to where they belonged
before we got there.

30:24.692 --> 30:25.867
I bet you're right.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.608
He wasn't worried about Andre.

30:27.651 --> 30:29.131
He was worried
about covering his ass.

30:29.175 --> 30:31.351
Okay, but then why does
the entire crew

30:31.394 --> 30:32.874
back him up on the report?

30:32.918 --> 30:35.485
Those kinds of shady practices
endanger all of them.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.096
It's a big company.

30:37.139 --> 30:39.359
They control a lot
of the work in town.

30:39.402 --> 30:40.882
Why make an enemy of them?

30:40.926 --> 30:42.318
Mm.

30:42.362 --> 30:46.670
I know one of those guys,
Gavin Murphy.

30:46.714 --> 30:49.325
Did a job with him once.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.762
He's a decent guy.

30:51.806 --> 30:52.894
He must have gotten
pressured into this.

30:55.505 --> 30:56.898
Think you can flip him?

30:56.942 --> 30:58.726
Well, I gotta
find him first.

30:58.769 --> 31:02.382
I know his info
is in here somewhere.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.863
Need an extra set of eyes?

31:07.735 --> 31:09.084
- Thanks, Lieutenant.
- Yeah.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.261
But can I ask?

31:12.305 --> 31:16.875
How come you're going along
with me on all this?

31:16.918 --> 31:18.180
You don't even like me.

31:22.228 --> 31:28.712
It's true Chief Boden foisted
you on me against my will.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.932
But he wouldn't have done it

31:30.976 --> 31:33.195
if he didn't see something
in you.

31:33.239 --> 31:37.678
And this has been a chance
for me to see it for myself.

31:57.437 --> 31:58.612
Hmm.

31:58.655 --> 32:00.657
I was sure you'd ghost me.

32:00.701 --> 32:01.963
What? No.

32:02.007 --> 32:03.312
And I definitely
wasn't expecting

32:03.356 --> 32:06.881
a booty text this early.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.622
Or is it late for you?

32:18.675 --> 32:20.199
His sister isn't home.

32:20.242 --> 32:21.940
We'll have to track her down
at work.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.115
Whatever it takes.

32:24.116 --> 32:25.421
Oh.

32:25.465 --> 32:27.597
Oh, God. It's Trudy.

32:27.641 --> 32:30.600
Well, she's your wife, Mouch.
You can handle this.

32:30.644 --> 32:32.602
Here, I'll deal with Warren.

32:32.646 --> 32:33.777
Hey, love.

32:35.605 --> 32:37.216
Uh, which light bulbs?

32:42.569 --> 32:43.831
Hello?

32:45.485 --> 32:48.009
Stephanie?

32:48.053 --> 32:50.446
Warren?

32:50.490 --> 32:52.448
Hello?

32:52.492 --> 32:54.450
Is anyone home?

32:54.494 --> 32:56.452
It's Sylvie.

33:12.555 --> 33:13.643
<i>No?</i>

33:13.687 --> 33:17.299
Okay, then check the credenza

33:17.343 --> 33:19.649
in the dining room,
bottom left drawer.

33:19.693 --> 33:21.173
Yep, I'll wait.

33:24.089 --> 33:27.657
Warren, I'm sorry
that I just came in.

33:27.701 --> 33:28.789
The door was open.

33:28.832 --> 33:30.530
You're not
taking me anywhere.

33:30.573 --> 33:33.185
Warren, it's me, Sylvie.

33:33.228 --> 33:34.664
I've been here before, remember?

33:34.708 --> 33:38.668
Okay. Love you too.

33:38.712 --> 33:40.366
Is Warren doing okay?

33:40.409 --> 33:41.671
Can you put down
the hammer, please?

33:41.715 --> 33:43.151
I want to stay here.

33:43.195 --> 33:44.761
I'm so glad you folks
are coming by more often

33:44.805 --> 33:47.851
now that his sister, you know.

33:50.463 --> 33:51.986
Okay, Warren,
I think you haven't

33:52.030 --> 33:53.205
been taking your medication.

33:53.248 --> 33:54.554
I'm just gonna whip
something up for you.

33:54.597 --> 33:55.685
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Okay.

33:55.729 --> 33:57.557
What about his sister?

33:57.600 --> 34:01.735
She died in a car accident
about three weeks ago.

34:01.778 --> 34:05.217
I'm not going anywhere.

34:05.260 --> 34:07.915
I'm not going anywhere.
- Warren.

34:11.527 --> 34:13.094
Warren.

34:13.138 --> 34:15.531
This is where I live.

34:15.575 --> 34:16.793
Sylvie!

34:16.837 --> 34:18.230
Whoa.

34:18.273 --> 34:21.407
Whoa. Warren, easy, easy.

34:21.450 --> 34:23.235
Easy, buddy. Easy.

34:23.278 --> 34:25.106
Easy now.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.760
- Ah!

34:42.167 --> 34:44.560
This is insulting.

34:44.604 --> 34:46.736
If I see flags, I don't dig.

34:46.780 --> 34:48.390
Simple as that.

34:48.434 --> 34:51.219
You don't have to
convince us, Andre.

34:53.265 --> 34:56.746
Are you sure
this Gavin guy is coming?

34:56.790 --> 34:59.227
He'll be here.

34:59.271 --> 35:00.663
How'd you get him to agree?

35:02.578 --> 35:04.711
I can be very persuasive.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.149
See?

35:08.193 --> 35:09.672
Okay, Carver, here I am.

35:09.716 --> 35:10.934
All that stuff
you said on the phone,

35:10.978 --> 35:12.327
you want to try saying it
to my face now?

35:12.371 --> 35:13.981
Easy, Gavin.

35:14.024 --> 35:15.852
Why don't you start
by saying hello to Andre?

35:15.896 --> 35:17.158
Hey, Andre.

35:17.202 --> 35:19.552
Sorry about your accident, man.

35:19.595 --> 35:22.163
I'm glad you're okay, but you
about to get your ass kicked.

35:22.207 --> 35:23.338
Calling me a liar?

35:23.382 --> 35:24.818
Does he look okay to you?

35:24.861 --> 35:26.167
I've laid guys out
for way less, Carver.

35:26.211 --> 35:27.516
Look at him!

35:29.388 --> 35:32.391
Does he look okay to you?

35:37.004 --> 35:39.398
Damn, Andre.

35:39.441 --> 35:41.922
Nobody told you
about the leg, huh?

35:41.965 --> 35:45.317
Well, you'd have known
if you bothered to visit him.

35:48.624 --> 35:51.192
Did Mitch tell you guys
to stay away?

35:51.236 --> 35:52.585
Why don't you tell Andre

35:52.628 --> 35:55.327
how it's his fault
he lost that leg?

35:55.370 --> 35:57.633
Go ahead.
You said as much in the report.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.809
Now look him
in the eye and say it.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.905
Look, they--
they asked me what I saw,

36:08.949 --> 36:10.124
so I said what I saw.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.778
Come on!

36:11.821 --> 36:12.996
You were working
that site for a week

36:13.040 --> 36:14.781
before I showed up
with the excavator.

36:16.696 --> 36:18.741
You know what really happened.

36:20.613 --> 36:22.005
One day those flags
are over here,

36:22.049 --> 36:24.704
and next, they seem...

36:24.747 --> 36:26.619
in not quite the same place.

36:34.627 --> 36:36.803
It could have been you.

36:49.903 --> 36:51.513
Hi. Checking in.

36:51.557 --> 36:53.428
Hawkins, Evan. Any messages?

36:53.472 --> 36:56.562
Um, yes.

36:58.477 --> 37:00.435
Here you are.

37:10.271 --> 37:11.403
Hello?

37:14.667 --> 37:16.364
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're early.

37:18.627 --> 37:20.455
I have this--
this sexy camisole thing

37:20.499 --> 37:21.935
I was gonna change into.

37:21.978 --> 37:23.241
It's kind of this weird
orange color, but--

37:32.554 --> 37:35.427
Only you could make
the Waukegan Marriott

37:35.470 --> 37:37.385
the hottest place on Earth.

37:40.388 --> 37:41.563
Mm!

37:44.784 --> 37:46.176
Wow, look at all of this.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.743
I wish you would have
let me bring dessert.

37:47.787 --> 37:49.615
Oh, this was
no trouble at all.

37:49.658 --> 37:52.487
I'm just so grateful
you both are all right.

37:52.531 --> 37:55.490
That could have ended
very badly today.

37:55.534 --> 37:58.188
Well, it did for Warren.

37:58.232 --> 38:01.017
With no other family to care
for him, he'll be committed.

38:01.061 --> 38:04.717
Well, hopefully,
he'll get the help he needs.

38:16.076 --> 38:17.599
Breakups are hard.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.386
You told her?

38:21.429 --> 38:27.130
I once tossed a bowling ball
through a guy's windshield

38:27.174 --> 38:30.612
after we parted company.

38:30.656 --> 38:31.700
Young love.

38:31.744 --> 38:36.662
Baby, I was 37.

38:36.705 --> 38:39.099
I got more stories
like that, if you want them.

38:39.142 --> 38:40.796
Yes, please.

38:40.840 --> 38:44.409
Don't even ask me
what I did with superglue.

38:47.586 --> 38:49.457
All right,
listen up, all right?

38:49.501 --> 38:50.893
My niece is coming by tonight.

38:50.937 --> 38:53.113
She's been getting
in trouble lately,

38:53.156 --> 38:55.028
so I promised her dad that

38:55.071 --> 38:56.725
I would give her a job here,
you know,

38:56.769 --> 38:58.074
help her get back on track.

38:58.118 --> 39:00.555
So everybody be on
your best behavior.

39:00.599 --> 39:02.557
Understand me?

39:02.601 --> 39:05.081
Keep your distance.

39:09.390 --> 39:10.565
Hey!

39:10.609 --> 39:12.306
Here she is.

39:12.350 --> 39:16.092
Guys--guys, this is Tracy.

39:16.136 --> 39:19.139
Tracy, this is Ritter
and Gallo.

39:22.229 --> 39:23.622
Nice to meet you.

39:23.665 --> 39:25.493
Yeah, same.

39:27.495 --> 39:29.236
Welcome to Molly's, Tracy.

39:38.898 --> 39:41.814
That was a good thing
you did.

39:41.857 --> 39:44.294
So this one's
on the house, Carver.

39:44.338 --> 39:45.600
Are you sure?

39:45.644 --> 39:48.560
I was told that wasn't a thing
at Hermann's bar.

39:48.603 --> 39:51.432
What he doesn't know...

39:51.476 --> 39:52.607
Well, thank you.

39:54.479 --> 39:59.658
Now, how about you tell me
where you really got that scar?

40:02.138 --> 40:05.141
'Cause it sure as hell
wasn't a house fire in Pilsen.

40:07.448 --> 40:09.145
What makes you say that?

40:09.189 --> 40:10.756
Because you already
had it in that picture

40:10.799 --> 40:13.106
you showed me
from your construction days.

40:17.632 --> 40:20.113
Why lie about it?

40:23.203 --> 40:25.292
Okay, look. I get it.

40:25.335 --> 40:26.859
I have stuff from my past
that I'd prefer

40:26.902 --> 40:28.948
to change the story on too.

40:31.733 --> 40:34.475
But there won't be a place
for you on my truck

40:34.519 --> 40:37.347
if you lie to me again.

40:45.181 --> 40:48.097
Then I'll just have to
keep quiet about the scar.

40:51.884 --> 40:54.364
Thanks for the drink, Lieutenant.
