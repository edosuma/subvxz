Hey, guys. I just checked
the school talent show sign-up sheet,

00:15.140 --> 00:16.474
and none of you are on it.

00:16.766 --> 00:19.644
I can explain.
Um, none of us want to do it.

00:20.645 --> 00:23.690
Ah, come on. Here's your opportunity
to show off your greatest skill

00:23.773 --> 00:26.317

You know, tickle the ivories,

You guys are selling yourself short.
Everyone's good at something.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.671
Sometimes, it just takes risking
total humiliation in front of an audience

00:46.755 --> 00:47.964
to find out what it is.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.675
I don't need an audience
to be humili-tated.

00:50.759 --> 00:51.593
Hu...

00:53.219 --> 00:54.137
Humiliated!

00:57.057 --> 00:59.100
Yeah, I already had my talent show...

00:59.184 --> 01:01.478
against Poly. [chuckles] What, what?

01:02.520 --> 01:07.192
I'll tell you what, what: 220 yards, 
three TDs.

01:07.650 --> 01:08.777
That's what, what!

01:11.279 --> 01:13.948
Look, all year,
you guys have shown me what you can do

01:14.032 --> 01:15.450
when you believe in yourselves.

01:15.533 --> 01:19.037
Cool. If we've already done it,
then we don't have to do the talent show.

01:20.121 --> 01:23.249
Look, Mr. Iglesias, it's really easy
to believe in ourselves in here.

01:23.333 --> 01:27.212
Yeah. You make us feel safe like a--

Piss off, dingo!

01:37.597 --> 01:39.140
[in normal voice]
What if I enter the talent show?

01:39.224 --> 01:41.101
Just to prove to you
there's nothing to fear.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.477
Faculty can't enter.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.396
Okay, what if I convinced
Principal Madison to waive that rule?

01:45.480 --> 01:46.689
Will you do it if I do it?

01:46.773 --> 01:48.900
I will, and I don't even have a talent.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.195
I will, and I do.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.114
I don't know.

01:54.197 --> 01:58.284
How's Mr. Iglesias embarrassing himself
gonna make it any less painful for us?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.370
You just gotta trust me, Walt.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.997
I remember the last time
I put my faith in you.

Okay.

So, Gabe is gonna convince Paula

to let the faculty participate
in the talent show.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.287
Woo-hoo!
