00:01.898 --> 00:03.983
<i> My dad
didn't drink, didn't bowl,</i>

00:03.983 --> 00:05.886
<i>and didn't really enjoy other people,</i>

00:05.919 --> 00:08.038
<i>which put a damper on his social life.</i>

00:08.063 --> 00:09.188
<i>If he hung out with anyone...</i>

00:09.188 --> 00:10.156
<i>...it was our pastor,</i>

00:10.190 --> 00:11.463
<i>Father Dunne.</i>

00:12.541 --> 00:13.877
What are you doing here?

00:13.909 --> 00:15.754
I've been answering the door
at the rectory for weeks.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.317
Didn't you notice
I haven't been at dinner?

00:17.342 --> 00:19.588
I'm pretty focused on my plate.

00:20.155 --> 00:21.324
Is Father Dunne ready?

00:21.324 --> 00:23.622
- We're going to the Dodger game.
- I don't know where he is.

00:23.647 --> 00:25.623
I cannot pin down
that fluttery butterfly.

00:25.623 --> 00:27.276
Frank, is that your father?

00:27.301 --> 00:28.636
Tell Father Abdi I had to run.

00:28.636 --> 00:30.872
Father Abdi, get down here,
my dad has to run!

00:30.906 --> 00:32.674
<i>It's not that my dad
disliked Father Abdi.</i>

00:32.707 --> 00:34.509
<i>But he wasn't super comfortable
around people</i>

00:34.542 --> 00:37.278
<i>who were different in terms
of class or religion...</i>

00:37.312 --> 00:38.980
Hello, Mr. Mike Cleary.

00:39.014 --> 00:40.048
<i>...or other things.</i>

00:43.051 --> 00:45.888
<i>Father Abdi had come to us
as a missionary from Africa.</i>

00:45.920 --> 00:47.522
<i>His primary mission, as my mom saw it,</i>

00:47.556 --> 00:49.273
<i>was testing her faith.</i>

00:49.298 --> 00:51.400
Oh, hello,
Mrs. Peggy Cleary.

00:51.433 --> 00:53.068
Whenever I see your lovely family,

00:53.101 --> 00:55.353
it truly brightens my heart.

00:55.972 --> 00:57.231
Did not catch a word.

00:58.942 --> 01:00.576
Mrs. Peggy Cleary!

01:00.609 --> 01:02.272
You must try a Shushumow...

01:02.272 --> 01:04.307
it is like a doughnut, but from Somalia.

01:04.340 --> 01:06.744
It can't possibly be fresh
after making <i> that</i> trip.

01:06.777 --> 01:09.179
These little
African churros are outstanding.

01:09.212 --> 01:10.481
You gotta get in here, Peg.

01:12.934 --> 01:14.303
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:14.328 --> 01:15.368
Tell me,

01:15.368 --> 01:16.537
what is troubling you, my daughter?

01:16.570 --> 01:18.483
You know what, no sins this week.
See you next time.

01:18.483 --> 01:21.334
<i>Father Abdi had survived
brutal African warlords.</i>

01:21.366 --> 01:24.224
<i>He felt pretty good about his
chances with Mrs. Peggy Cleary.</i>

01:24.263 --> 01:26.437
<i>While my dad was looking
for Father Dunne,</i>

01:26.462 --> 01:28.264
<i>he was looking for my dad.</i>

01:28.298 --> 01:29.865
<i>With a mix-up like this in 1972...</i>

01:29.898 --> 01:31.334
<i>...there was no calling or texting</i>

01:31.367 --> 01:32.402
<i>to straighten things out.</i>

01:32.435 --> 01:33.737
<i>You gave up and went to bed.</i>

01:33.769 --> 01:35.037
<i>It was great.</i>

01:35.070 --> 01:36.906
Oh, hello, Father.

01:37.229 --> 01:39.934
You know, uh, Mike's not here.

01:39.934 --> 01:42.136
- We were supposed to go to the game.
- Oh.

01:42.284 --> 01:43.920
Any idea when he'll be back?

01:43.953 --> 01:46.489
No. No way to find out.

01:46.522 --> 01:49.354
Not like he's a spaceman with
a telephone in his pocket.

01:49.354 --> 01:50.490
"Hello, this is Mike.

01:50.523 --> 01:52.491
I'm on a phone just
walking around outside."

01:54.627 --> 01:56.849
Frank's at the rectory.
You could take him.

01:57.007 --> 01:58.130
Um...

01:58.163 --> 01:59.894
Lawrence, would you like to go?

01:59.919 --> 02:01.632
I will grab my jacket.

02:01.868 --> 02:03.268
Nothing against Frank.

02:04.704 --> 02:06.940
But I see an awful lot
of that boy these days.

02:06.973 --> 02:09.626
- I get it. Frank's a small-dose person.
- Ah.

02:09.651 --> 02:12.212
Might end up being one
of my "holidays-only" sons.

02:15.069 --> 02:17.516
<i>When my brother Eddie
had his garbage-man job,</i>

02:17.550 --> 02:19.407
<i>he invented a fun game called</i>

02:19.432 --> 02:20.820
<i>"Hey, look what someone threw out."</i>

02:20.853 --> 02:22.705
Hey, look what someone threw out!

02:22.730 --> 02:23.856
A ping-pong table!

02:23.890 --> 02:25.391
We can have a lot of fun with that!

02:25.423 --> 02:27.726
Yeah, we could set it on fire
or roll it into traffic.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.161
Or you could play ping-pong.

02:29.194 --> 02:30.963
Well, sure. First.

02:30.997 --> 02:33.181
Well, we agreed to meet at the rectory.

02:33.181 --> 02:34.534
Father Dunne screwed up.

02:34.567 --> 02:35.635
He's a priest, Mike. He's infallible.

02:35.667 --> 02:36.969
Well, if that was the case,

02:37.003 --> 02:37.875
I'd have seen a ballgame last night.

02:37.875 --> 02:38.910
Were you sad you missed hanging out

02:38.944 --> 02:40.079
with your friend Father Dunne?

02:40.111 --> 02:41.300
He's not my friend, he's my priest.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.002
Why can't he be your friend <i>
and</i> your priest?

02:43.036 --> 02:44.951
I mean, I'm your friend and your son.

02:44.951 --> 02:47.754
You're on thin ice in both
those categories, pal.

02:47.788 --> 02:49.290
"Pal."

02:49.323 --> 02:51.025
How was the game last night?

02:51.057 --> 02:53.241
Fun. I, uh, almost caught a foul ball.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.542
If I was there, I would've caught it.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.343
You owe me one ball.

02:56.376 --> 02:57.712
Something else.

02:57.712 --> 03:01.681
Uh, Father Dunne confided
in me that he has...

03:01.942 --> 03:03.403
a girlfriend.

03:04.616 --> 03:05.516
What?

03:05.516 --> 03:06.751
Father Dunne probably said

03:06.784 --> 03:08.319
something about his love
for the Blessed Mother,

03:08.351 --> 03:09.986
and you turned it
all smutty in your head.

03:10.020 --> 03:11.488
What did he say exactly

03:11.522 --> 03:13.326
that made you think he has a girlfriend?

03:13.326 --> 03:14.895
He said, "I have a girlfriend."

03:15.097 --> 03:16.788
Apparently they've been
dating for a while,

03:16.788 --> 03:18.435
and he's starting to rethink
his life choices.

03:18.435 --> 03:20.554
I think he's entitled
to do what makes him happy.

03:20.610 --> 03:21.500
Happy.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.830
Let's all slide down a rainbow

03:22.855 --> 03:24.274
into a big bowl of pudding.

03:24.274 --> 03:25.809
This only happened
'cause you took my ticket.

03:25.843 --> 03:28.079
You owe me one ball and one priest.

03:28.111 --> 03:30.247
Do not say a word to anybody else.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.085
I'm gonna go make sure a civic leader

03:32.110 --> 03:34.040
doesn't throw his career away.

03:37.817 --> 03:39.919
Are Mom's pantyhose
strong enough for a net?

03:39.951 --> 03:40.895
They're not Mom's.

03:40.895 --> 03:42.931
I took these from Old Lady
Strausser's clothesline.

03:43.033 --> 03:44.668
If they can hold all that together,

03:44.700 --> 03:46.338
I'm pretty sure they can
handle a ping-pong ball.

03:46.362 --> 03:47.024
Hm.

03:47.447 --> 03:48.902
I hate to do this.

03:48.902 --> 03:51.553
Lord Sockington was my first
ventriloquism puppet.

03:51.585 --> 03:53.788
Don't worry. I'll be gentle.

03:53.822 --> 03:54.943
"No,

03:55.322 --> 03:56.490
not my eyes!"

03:58.493 --> 03:59.662
Eh.

04:00.561 --> 04:01.829
Where's Father Dunne?

04:01.863 --> 04:03.832
This time, I actually do know,

04:03.864 --> 04:05.769
but I signed an oath of confidentiality.

04:05.769 --> 04:06.737
Not from the Church,

04:06.770 --> 04:08.608
just something I drafted myself.

04:08.633 --> 04:09.989
Come on in, Mike!

04:09.989 --> 04:12.449
I believe Father Dunne
may now be available.

04:13.013 --> 04:15.384
A Mr. Cleary here to see you, Father.

04:16.338 --> 04:17.890
Lawrence told me a crazy story

04:17.890 --> 04:19.325
about you having a girlfriend.

04:19.358 --> 04:20.767
It's true.

04:21.974 --> 04:23.934
Pardon my language, Father, but...

04:25.118 --> 04:26.820
what the heck are you doing?

04:26.852 --> 04:28.187
For the last few months,

04:28.221 --> 04:30.080
I've been helping Loretta Buzek

04:30.080 --> 04:32.616
deal with the illness and the passing

04:32.649 --> 04:34.051
of her husband, Earl.

04:34.084 --> 04:35.314
Loretta Buzek?

04:35.314 --> 04:38.462
And in that time,
I've experienced feelings.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.122
Priest-parishioner feelings?

04:40.155 --> 04:41.690
Man-woman feelings.

04:41.723 --> 04:44.492
Specifically man-Buzek feelings.

04:46.121 --> 04:47.329
Have you acted on them?

04:47.362 --> 04:48.629
No, of course not.

04:48.663 --> 04:49.582
But...

04:49.997 --> 04:51.598
Loretta has made it clear

04:52.149 --> 04:54.218
it's mine for the taking.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.700
Don't. Don't... take...

04:57.998 --> 04:59.296
...anything.

04:59.296 --> 05:01.565
And I'm gonna give you
the same good advice

05:01.597 --> 05:04.097
that you have given me
a hundred times...

05:04.470 --> 05:07.503
consider how this affects
the people you care about most

05:07.964 --> 05:09.770
and you will always
make the right choice.

05:14.699 --> 05:16.001
Ah, rats!

05:16.035 --> 05:17.003
Rats, rats, rats!

05:21.472 --> 05:23.074
This stupid paddle's defective.

05:23.107 --> 05:24.576
Oh, let me see yours for a sec.

05:26.811 --> 05:28.079
Okay.

05:28.112 --> 05:29.948
Yeah, no, this one's mine now.

05:29.982 --> 05:31.710
It's time to get ready for Mass.

05:32.818 --> 05:33.622
Hey!

05:33.622 --> 05:35.558
Those are Mrs. Strausser's pantyhose.

05:35.591 --> 05:36.599
They're prescription.

05:36.599 --> 05:38.286
And she's down to her last pair.

05:38.311 --> 05:39.667
Why do you know that?

05:43.082 --> 05:46.086
The Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.484
Amen.

05:48.254 --> 05:50.448
Just a few announcements.

05:50.858 --> 05:52.927
I have been wrestling with a decision

05:52.959 --> 05:55.749
regarding my future
here at Holy Redeemer.

05:56.129 --> 05:58.932
Fortunately, I received
some wonderful advice

05:58.966 --> 06:01.134
from my good friend, Mike Cleary.

06:01.168 --> 06:02.415
"Friend."

06:02.440 --> 06:04.556
Mike said to consider how my decision

06:04.556 --> 06:07.060
affects those people I care about most.

06:07.626 --> 06:08.822
With that in mind,

06:09.159 --> 06:13.224
I decided I'm leaving
Holy Redeemer immediately...

06:13.523 --> 06:15.758
...to date Loretta Buzek.

06:17.325 --> 06:19.330
From here on, you'll be
in the capable hands

06:19.330 --> 06:22.834
of our associate pastor, Bootaan Abdi.

06:22.866 --> 06:25.022
Father Abdi.

06:29.170 --> 06:31.737
Look at me, look at me.

06:33.809 --> 06:35.645
I am the pastor now.

06:38.269 --> 06:40.571
<i>Over the next few weeks,
my folks did their best</i>

06:40.605 --> 06:42.307
<i>to adjust to our new pastor.</i>

06:42.339 --> 06:43.407
I don't like him at all.

06:43.441 --> 06:45.210
In a way, I blame myself.

06:45.242 --> 06:46.778
<i>Everybody</i> blames you.

06:46.812 --> 06:48.517
Father Dunne blamed you from the altar.

06:48.517 --> 06:50.518
So Father Dunne has a fling
with Loretta Buzek.

06:50.518 --> 06:52.747
I'd rather deal with that
than "Father Talks-Funny"...

06:52.772 --> 06:54.831
who probably has 12 wives
back in Africa.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.302
I can't help but notice

06:58.335 --> 07:00.271
just a whiff of racial prejudice

07:00.304 --> 07:01.853
in the way you discuss Father Abdi.

07:01.853 --> 07:03.355
I am not prejudiced.

07:03.389 --> 07:04.691
I just don't like that
he's from a weird place

07:04.723 --> 07:05.891
and doesn't look like us.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.327
And that accent.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.728
Might as well go back to Mass in Latin

07:08.761 --> 07:10.497
if it's all just gonna be gibberish.

07:10.529 --> 07:11.663
I could translate.

07:11.697 --> 07:13.009
You don't speak Latin.

07:13.009 --> 07:14.225
I speak gibberish.

07:15.740 --> 07:17.450
You know, there's actually
a fair amount of scholarship

07:17.475 --> 07:18.970
that suggests that Jesus was black.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.538
- Scholarship?
- Mm-hmm.

07:20.571 --> 07:21.607
Nobody got a scholarship
for saying that.

07:21.639 --> 07:23.241
I mean, look at him.

07:23.275 --> 07:24.884
Does he look like an Afro-American?

07:24.884 --> 07:26.853
You know that's not a photo, right?

07:26.886 --> 07:28.521
So now you know more than the gift shop

07:28.554 --> 07:30.356
at the San Fernando Mission?

07:30.389 --> 07:32.959
I saw Father Dunne
on my route yesterday.

07:32.992 --> 07:34.527
He's living in the apartment
building next door.

07:34.559 --> 07:35.961
- Father Dunne?
- Seriously?

07:35.995 --> 07:37.663
He's moved in with Mrs. Buzek.

07:37.696 --> 07:39.098
That woman.

07:39.131 --> 07:40.633
All through her husband's emphysema,

07:40.665 --> 07:42.535
I saw her sizing up replacements.

07:42.567 --> 07:44.686
She wore Shalimar to Earl's wake.

07:44.686 --> 07:47.090
I thought you'd be happy to have
Father Dunne for a neighbor.

07:47.122 --> 07:48.771
He's not Father Dunne anymore.

07:48.771 --> 07:50.696
He's a randy old goat named "Cecil."

07:50.721 --> 07:51.989
What are you gonna say when you see him?

07:52.022 --> 07:53.471
I'm gonna treat him
like any other neighbor...

07:53.496 --> 07:54.564
with a curt gruffness

07:54.564 --> 07:56.317
that allows no follow-up questions.

07:57.025 --> 07:58.761
Living in sin right next door.

07:58.794 --> 08:00.597
I hope they close the drapes.

08:00.629 --> 08:02.136
Our kids pick up
more than you think.

08:02.136 --> 08:04.166
I know what you guys are talking about,

08:04.253 --> 08:05.937
and I totally agree.

08:05.937 --> 08:07.453
We should start a farm!

08:09.072 --> 08:10.401
Excuse me, Father.

08:10.401 --> 08:12.737
- Oh, Frank.
- Now that you're in charge,

08:12.769 --> 08:13.871
I'm hoping you'll do something

08:13.904 --> 08:15.539
about the silver and gold on the altar.

08:15.572 --> 08:17.174
It's... Well, it's embarrassing.

08:17.207 --> 08:18.344
I see your point, Frank.

08:18.344 --> 08:21.515
It is unseemly to display
ostentatious wealth.

08:21.801 --> 08:24.070
I just meant it should be shinier.

08:24.103 --> 08:26.222
Okay, if you'd like to polish it...

08:26.222 --> 08:28.858
I also think we need to get
tougher in the confessional...

08:28.891 --> 08:30.093
maybe assign a few push-ups

08:30.126 --> 08:32.096
to go along with the Hail Marys.

08:32.129 --> 08:33.630
If you want to establish order
around here,

08:33.664 --> 08:35.097
you're gonna have to start sending

08:35.131 --> 08:36.299
a lot more people to Hell.

08:36.332 --> 08:38.534
You've given this some thought.

08:38.568 --> 08:40.370
It's what I think about
most of the time.

08:40.404 --> 08:43.407
I'm getting a sense you would
like more responsibility, Frank.

08:43.438 --> 08:46.376
So I've decided to trust you with these.

08:47.623 --> 08:49.326
The keys to the kingdom?

08:49.359 --> 08:51.027
The rectory, the sacristy.

08:51.060 --> 08:52.799
And this one turns on the sprinklers.

08:54.345 --> 08:56.770
Thank you for this honor, sir.

08:59.082 --> 08:59.983
You don't have to salute.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.152
Actually, I do.

09:01.185 --> 09:02.620
I added it to
the confidentiality agreement

09:02.653 --> 09:03.620
that I drafted.

09:06.322 --> 09:07.490
Oh, my...

09:10.786 --> 09:12.049
Hi, Father Dunne.

09:12.349 --> 09:16.408
I hope it's not too unsettling
to see me out of uniform.

09:16.433 --> 09:18.420
It's a lot like the time I saw Santa

09:18.445 --> 09:19.530
smoking behind the mall.

09:19.530 --> 09:21.466
Oh, now that you're not
a priest anymore,

09:21.499 --> 09:23.065
there <i> is</i> something
I've always wanted to ask.

09:23.090 --> 09:24.493
Go ahead, son.

09:24.526 --> 09:26.228
It's all just nonsense, right?

09:26.261 --> 09:27.429
What's going on?

09:27.429 --> 09:28.798
Oh, Mike! Uh...

09:28.831 --> 09:30.871
I was hoping I'd run into you here.

09:30.896 --> 09:34.027
It's kind of
unavoidable in my driveway.

09:34.027 --> 09:35.601
I live right next door now.

09:35.601 --> 09:38.037
Yeah, but, uh, that doesn't
mean that the two of us...

09:38.069 --> 09:40.238
Loretta! I'm talking to Mike!

09:40.271 --> 09:41.940
Mike! Hi!

09:41.973 --> 09:43.276
Can you believe it?

09:43.309 --> 09:45.310
I'm so excited I had to take a pill.

09:45.343 --> 09:47.243
Baby, I didn't tell him yet.

09:47.243 --> 09:48.912
- Well, tell him.
- Tell me what?

09:48.945 --> 09:50.514
We're getting married!

09:50.547 --> 09:52.315
- We're getting married.
- Yes!

09:52.348 --> 09:54.651
And we're throwing
an engagement reception.

09:54.685 --> 09:55.853
Uh...

09:55.886 --> 09:58.089
We're having sponge cake, rumaki,

09:58.122 --> 09:59.723
and themed beverages.

09:59.757 --> 10:02.526
The party's gonna keep going
until the cops bust it up.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.761
Or 8:30.

10:03.794 --> 10:06.430
You and Peggy have to come.

10:06.464 --> 10:08.105
- Uh...
- Would mean a lot to me, Mike.

10:08.897 --> 10:10.767
I can't even think about getting married

10:10.792 --> 10:12.828
without my best friend being involved.

10:16.331 --> 10:17.799
I couldn't get out of it.

10:17.832 --> 10:19.534
Oh, if you had seen his face.

10:19.567 --> 10:21.000
Did he look like a sad dog?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.101
'Cause that's just his face.

10:22.135 --> 10:23.846
You think maybe Eddie's right?

10:23.846 --> 10:26.416
Oh, my God, no. About what?

10:26.448 --> 10:28.116
About Father Dunne being my friend

10:28.150 --> 10:30.019
all these years.
That's how he thinks of me.

10:30.052 --> 10:31.988
Well, it doesn't mean
you have to buy into it.

10:32.020 --> 10:33.471
Engagement party.

10:33.496 --> 10:35.265
Remember the party we threw
after we got engaged?

10:35.290 --> 10:36.458
It's called a wedding.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.841

11:13.873 --> 11:16.222
He doesn't look
right in civilian clothes.

11:16.222 --> 11:17.724
That was Earl's suit.

11:17.757 --> 11:20.993
Smart girl. She found one the same size.

11:21.026 --> 11:24.697
I would like to make a toast
to my beautiful bride-to-be

11:24.729 --> 11:28.433
who has given me something
that I've only ever seen

11:28.467 --> 11:30.336
on the faces of other people.

11:30.368 --> 11:31.369
Cold sores?

11:31.410 --> 11:34.242
Genuine, heartfelt joy.

11:34.242 --> 11:36.745
And to my soon-to-be
stepdaughter, Sabrina,

11:36.779 --> 11:40.514
who has graciously permitted me
to marry her mom.

11:41.623 --> 11:45.361
To life and enjoying
however much we have left.

11:45.394 --> 11:47.830
Thank you, sweetheart.

11:47.863 --> 11:50.032
Hello, Mrs. Peggy Cleary.

11:50.065 --> 11:51.100
What an occasion!

11:51.133 --> 11:52.816
Ice in all the drinks.

11:52.841 --> 11:54.210
Such luxury.

11:54.243 --> 11:55.332
So, you're on board with all this?

11:55.332 --> 11:57.266
Father Dunne welching
on his sacred oath?

11:57.299 --> 11:58.868
I support this relationship.

11:58.901 --> 12:01.204
Theirs is a love
which affirms the Divine.

12:01.237 --> 12:03.272
Plus, with him gone,

12:03.305 --> 12:04.974
I get to drive the church Bonneville.

12:05.007 --> 12:06.509
That car has a lot of miles on it.

12:06.543 --> 12:08.428
Then again, so does Loretta.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.198
Hope she's worth getting
cast out of the church forever.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.634
No, the Archbishop loves Father Dunne.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.769
If this relationship were to end,

12:15.802 --> 12:17.438
they would give him his pastor job back

12:17.471 --> 12:19.606
quicker than you could say,
"Hit the road, Abdi."

12:19.640 --> 12:21.040
That'd be a shame.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.275
But that's not going to happen.

12:22.719 --> 12:24.781
Look at how happy everyone is.

12:24.781 --> 12:27.551
<i>My mother never understood
a word Father Abdi said</i>

12:27.584 --> 12:30.353
<i>until he gave her an idea
for how to get rid of him.</i>

12:32.220 --> 12:33.657
Hello, Sabrina.

12:33.690 --> 12:35.559
You must be pleased for your mom.

12:35.591 --> 12:38.727
I was so sorry to hear
about your father's death.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.863
- Do I know you?
- I'm Peggy.

12:40.897 --> 12:42.766
I'm your mother's best friend.

12:42.798 --> 12:44.567
Must be such a comfort to you

12:44.600 --> 12:47.937
to know she found someone
to fill your father's shoes.

12:47.970 --> 12:49.873
Those <i> are</i> Dad's shoes.

12:49.906 --> 12:51.102
Oh.

12:51.541 --> 12:53.243
Just seems like they got together

12:53.276 --> 12:56.054
so quickly after my father passed.

12:56.054 --> 12:58.324
Well, "after," "before"...

12:58.357 --> 13:00.260
what's important is that
he was there for her.

13:00.293 --> 13:01.861
When your father was ill,

13:01.894 --> 13:06.060
Cecil was at your mother's side
night after night.

13:06.060 --> 13:07.567
And when the doctors were calling for

13:07.592 --> 13:08.592
extraordinary measures,

13:08.625 --> 13:09.854
Cecil stepped up.

13:09.854 --> 13:11.990
"No, no, unplug him.

13:12.024 --> 13:13.771
He'll be in a better place."

13:13.771 --> 13:16.474
Well, looks like Cecil's in
a better place now, too, huh?

13:16.507 --> 13:18.209
Ah.

13:18.242 --> 13:19.276
Okay.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:28.419 --> 13:30.195
That thing is amazing. I mean,

13:30.220 --> 13:31.756
it must be the perfect shape
or something.

13:31.790 --> 13:33.065
It's because it's from church.

13:33.065 --> 13:35.809
This is coated with
the sacred drool of believers.

13:35.834 --> 13:36.971
Huh.

13:36.971 --> 13:39.308
Maybe all this God stuff
isn't a bunch of banana oil.

13:39.341 --> 13:42.144
<i>And that was about as spiritual
as my brother Joey got.</i>

13:42.176 --> 13:43.144
I knew it!

13:43.178 --> 13:45.080
I hope you had your fun!

13:45.112 --> 13:48.000
Because when Father Abdi
gets serious about penance,

13:48.025 --> 13:49.224
you are going to be doing

13:49.224 --> 13:50.560
so many push-ups!

13:56.351 --> 13:58.006
Father, um...

13:58.587 --> 13:59.655
Cecil.

13:59.688 --> 14:00.674
Mike.

14:01.106 --> 14:03.843
I'm glad I caught you
away from the others.

14:03.876 --> 14:06.450
I have questions regarding...

14:06.880 --> 14:08.181
...the wedding night.

14:08.213 --> 14:09.815
Oh, no.

14:09.848 --> 14:11.017
No. I'm not the one to ask.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.985
I can't think of anybody better.

14:13.019 --> 14:16.356
I've always seen you and Peg
as the ideal couple.

14:16.389 --> 14:19.560
The two of you are the reason
I decided to make this move.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.681
- We are?
- Of course.

14:21.681 --> 14:23.615
Seeing the life you made together,

14:23.648 --> 14:25.618
the happiness I missed out on...

14:25.651 --> 14:27.220
What about all the times I came to you

14:27.253 --> 14:28.888
with my nightmare stories?

14:28.921 --> 14:30.657
Like the time Pat
let the possum in the house

14:30.690 --> 14:32.117
and it somehow locked us all out?

14:32.117 --> 14:33.852
It all sounded wonderful.

14:36.754 --> 14:38.267
We need that juiced-up Jesus paddle.

14:38.267 --> 14:39.569
It's great for ping-pong,

14:39.603 --> 14:40.703
and it's the only
credible evidence of God

14:40.737 --> 14:42.072
I have ever seen.

14:42.104 --> 14:43.706
Frank locked it up back at the church.

14:43.739 --> 14:46.403
So we wait till he's asleep,
then take his keys.

14:46.843 --> 14:48.578
You wanna break into the church?

14:48.612 --> 14:49.973
Any court'll tell you

14:49.973 --> 14:51.308
it's not breaking in
if you have the keys.

14:51.340 --> 14:52.522
I don't think that's true.

14:52.522 --> 14:53.890
What happened to my keychain?!

14:56.591 --> 14:58.894
I had them! They were attached to me,

14:58.927 --> 15:00.330
and I to them!

15:00.363 --> 15:02.299
<i>You</i> stole my keys.

15:02.331 --> 15:03.966
What a heinous thing to suggest.

15:03.999 --> 15:06.902
I was totally planning to but
hadn't got around to it yet.

15:06.936 --> 15:08.405
This is a fine howdy-do.

15:08.437 --> 15:09.972
I have no idea where I left them.

15:10.005 --> 15:12.777
So then it's just a matter
of who finds them first.

15:12.777 --> 15:15.343
Timmy, take the kitchen.
Be sure to check the ice box.

15:15.368 --> 15:16.669
Frank spends a lot of time

15:16.669 --> 15:18.203
staring at the Land O'Lakes girl.

15:24.077 --> 15:25.712
Well, we went out of the house,

15:25.745 --> 15:27.647
we were pleasant to people,
we're now done for the year.

15:30.283 --> 15:32.252
I had a talk with Cecil.

15:32.284 --> 15:33.593
I think we really <i> are</i> friends.

15:34.102 --> 15:36.204
Watch out if he asks you
to be his best man.

15:36.237 --> 15:37.806
You don't want to be
standing next to him

15:37.840 --> 15:39.242
holding the ring when
the lightning strikes.

15:39.274 --> 15:41.409
Well, even though he's not
a priest anymore,

15:41.442 --> 15:42.685
I like him.

15:43.479 --> 15:44.901
Why shouldn't he be happy?

15:45.275 --> 15:46.910
Because he broke a commitment, Mike.

15:47.133 --> 15:48.469
Where would the world be if everyone

15:48.502 --> 15:50.238
threw off responsibilities

15:50.271 --> 15:51.606
and skipped through a giggle-forest

15:51.638 --> 15:52.606
chasing happiness?

15:52.640 --> 15:53.909
I know where I'd be.

15:54.138 --> 15:55.039
Nowhere different.

15:55.072 --> 15:56.540
I'd be right here.

15:56.574 --> 15:57.642
That's the thing about

15:57.675 --> 16:00.430
this whole "chasing happiness" nonsense.

16:00.430 --> 16:02.277
I mean, maybe we don't get it

16:02.302 --> 16:04.327
because we've got it.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.449
I'm happy, Peg.

16:06.482 --> 16:07.809
And I think you are, too.

16:07.809 --> 16:09.083
- Shut up.
- I mean it!

16:09.108 --> 16:11.012
This <i> is</i> happiness.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.458
Yeah, well, being happy is exhausting.

16:13.621 --> 16:14.990
Why didn't we pick being wealthy?

16:16.757 --> 16:18.059
Who on Earth?

16:19.761 --> 16:20.566
Cecil?

16:21.382 --> 16:23.051
Loretta broke up with me.

16:23.084 --> 16:25.134
She deep-sixed the wedding.

16:25.644 --> 16:27.844
I need a place to stay.

16:27.869 --> 16:28.883
What happened?

16:28.883 --> 16:30.568
Her daughter took back the blessing.

16:30.568 --> 16:33.176
She says she thinks I killed her father.

16:34.439 --> 16:36.645
Oh, was her daughter at the party?

16:36.670 --> 16:38.805
I would've said hi.

16:41.977 --> 16:43.679
- Thanks, Mike.
- You're welcome.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.380
You'll be okay.

16:47.149 --> 16:49.329
I suppose I could...

16:49.851 --> 16:51.453
let you sleep in my bed.

16:51.486 --> 16:53.455
I think that would be awkward
for me and Peggy.

16:54.766 --> 16:56.669
I'll tell you what would be nice, Mike.

16:57.062 --> 16:58.931
If you would pray with me.

16:58.964 --> 17:00.899
- You want me to...
- If you don't mind.

17:00.933 --> 17:02.367
I've had a rough day.

17:02.367 --> 17:05.337
I always loved the Peace Prayer
of St. Francis.

17:05.368 --> 17:06.371
Okay.

17:09.564 --> 17:11.458
- "Dear Lord..."
- "Dear Lord..."

17:11.458 --> 17:14.128
"...make me an instrument of Thy peace.

17:14.823 --> 17:16.374
Where there is hatred,

17:16.374 --> 17:18.145
let me sow love.

17:18.145 --> 17:19.540
Where there is injury...

17:19.566 --> 17:20.973
- Pardon.
- ...pardon.

17:21.357 --> 17:24.637
Where there is doubt, faith.

17:25.528 --> 17:29.032
Where there is darkness, light.

17:29.066 --> 17:32.620
Where there is sadness, joy."

17:32.620 --> 17:33.822
Headed out.

17:33.854 --> 17:35.089
No using the stove while I'm gone,

17:35.122 --> 17:37.011
unless you make enough for everybody.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.004
- Good morning, boys.
- Good morning.

17:40.029 --> 17:41.770
Mind if I grab a bowl?

17:41.770 --> 17:43.405
We have Count Chocula.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.407
It's not real Count Chocula.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.176
Mom buys Vampire Puffs
and then reuses the box.

17:48.210 --> 17:49.493
I'll take the Trix.

17:49.493 --> 17:50.995
That's just filled with oyster crackers.

17:51.027 --> 17:52.828
- Maybe I'll mix 'em.
- Hm.

17:54.430 --> 17:55.699
Loretta?

17:57.868 --> 17:59.537
Oh, for crying out loud.

17:59.570 --> 18:01.072
Hello, Mrs. Peggy Cleary.

18:01.104 --> 18:03.002
So good to see you. Come in.

18:03.503 --> 18:05.736
You are surprised to find me here.

18:05.761 --> 18:07.495
Not really.

18:07.529 --> 18:09.138
It's starting to seem
like Loretta has a type.

18:09.138 --> 18:11.608
Loretta has been in the bathroom
for quite some time.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.183
Oh. Did you bring her some
of those Somalian doughnuts?

18:14.183 --> 18:15.818
She is crying and heartbroken.

18:15.850 --> 18:18.291
I've come to talk to her
on behalf of Father Dunne.

18:18.316 --> 18:19.905
Please sit.

18:20.251 --> 18:21.720
I'll stand.

18:23.601 --> 18:26.253
She is upset and confused at
something her daughter told her.

18:26.278 --> 18:27.848
Ah, old people.

18:27.848 --> 18:29.416
When are they not upset and confused?

18:29.450 --> 18:31.952
I suggested she ignore
her daughter's concerns.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.755
Too often, parents bend
to their children's wishes.

18:34.789 --> 18:38.260
In my village, if a child
makes demand of the parents,

18:38.292 --> 18:41.029
we put them in a hole and
cover them with fire ants.

18:41.061 --> 18:42.630
That sounds like paradise.

18:42.664 --> 18:43.766
It's wonderful.

18:44.236 --> 18:45.705
Except for all of the ants.

18:45.737 --> 18:47.106
They basically rule our village.

18:47.139 --> 18:49.341
Oh, I'm gonna send your mom
a big can of Raid.

18:49.375 --> 18:51.945
You know, I've been spending
a lot of time

18:51.977 --> 18:54.179
- with your son Frank.
- Oh, sorry about that.

18:54.213 --> 18:55.348
I mean, it's either you or me.

18:55.380 --> 18:56.882
Mm, he has very big ideas

18:56.916 --> 18:58.685
of how our parish should be run.

18:58.717 --> 19:00.954
But he left these keys

19:00.986 --> 19:03.149
- dangling in the rectory door.
- Mm.

19:03.421 --> 19:05.557
I've been watching him
scrambling everywhere

19:05.590 --> 19:07.015
looking desperately to find them.

19:07.436 --> 19:09.104
I could tell him I have the keys,

19:09.137 --> 19:11.574
but instead, I'm letting him suffer.

19:11.608 --> 19:14.310
This will be a good lesson in humility.

19:14.343 --> 19:15.978
Plus it's funny.

19:16.012 --> 19:17.647
Is he sweating a lot?
He gets very sweaty.

19:17.679 --> 19:19.483
He's sweating a lot, yes.

19:19.515 --> 19:21.035
Here. You take these.

19:21.132 --> 19:22.668
Now you get to decide for how long

19:22.701 --> 19:25.013
Frank feels miserable.

19:25.213 --> 19:26.848
- What a thoughtful gift.
- Hm.

19:26.882 --> 19:28.683
Oh, Father.

19:29.253 --> 19:31.407
I feel like our family
might have gotten off

19:31.407 --> 19:32.738
on the wrong foot with you.

19:33.401 --> 19:35.761
Mike can be a little racist.

19:36.205 --> 19:37.440
We'll work on it,

19:38.220 --> 19:39.955
try not to be so small-minded.

19:39.980 --> 19:41.949
That would be a very good goal

19:41.982 --> 19:44.733
for all of us, Mrs. Peggy Cleary.

19:44.733 --> 19:45.934
Okay, enough, Loretta!

19:45.968 --> 19:47.232
You're making a meal of this!

19:52.232 --> 19:53.967
I used to be better at ping-pong.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.936
Or everyone was letting you win.

19:55.970 --> 19:57.704
Life's gonna be different
without that collar.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.025
You're telling me.

19:59.025 --> 20:00.994
Lately, I've been getting
the finger in traffic.

20:01.028 --> 20:03.198
Well, the good news is,
now you can give it back.

20:03.231 --> 20:04.566
Oh, I have.

20:04.599 --> 20:06.701
Hello, Cecil.

20:06.734 --> 20:09.003
- Loretta!
- Oh,

20:09.035 --> 20:11.739
I'm so sorry about our misunderstanding.

20:11.773 --> 20:13.727
Father Abdi and I set her straight.

20:14.166 --> 20:15.635
You and Father Abdi?

20:15.667 --> 20:18.404
You're the only one allowed
to have a priest friend?

20:18.436 --> 20:20.572
I'm just gonna
stop listening to Sabrina.

20:20.606 --> 20:22.608
I'm not even sure Earl was her father.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.776
If Catholicism has taught me anything,

20:24.810 --> 20:28.313
it's that stuff that
happened a long time ago

20:28.483 --> 20:30.252
doesn't really matter at all.

20:30.284 --> 20:31.253
Oh.

20:31.285 --> 20:32.186
Take it next door.

20:32.219 --> 20:33.588
And close the drapes.

20:35.779 --> 20:37.582
Look how happy they are.

20:37.615 --> 20:39.099
Why wouldn't they be?

20:39.099 --> 20:40.368
They got a long dirt nap

20:40.400 --> 20:42.170
waiting for 'em right over the horizon.

20:42.570 --> 20:44.906
We still got to slog through 20,
30 years.

20:46.329 --> 20:48.398
You still won't admit that we're happy?

20:48.432 --> 20:50.818
Happiness comes in
the afterlife, which is why

20:50.843 --> 20:52.314
we <i> don't want</i> to outlive our kids.

20:52.339 --> 20:53.290
Oh, God, no.

20:53.290 --> 20:55.426
Imagine getting to Heaven
and <i> they're</i> waiting for us.

20:55.460 --> 20:56.729
That's what's great

20:56.761 --> 20:58.896
about the way we raised these animals.

20:58.930 --> 21:01.376
What are the chances we see
all eight of them up there?

21:01.376 --> 21:02.644
I like our odds.
