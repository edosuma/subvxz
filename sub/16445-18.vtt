00:14.359 --> 00:16.426
Shall we begin?

00:17.495 --> 00:19.219
I am not Bruce,

00:19.364 --> 00:20.663
and I won't let you tell Alfred.

00:20.698 --> 00:21.798
How are you gonna stop me?

00:32.343 --> 00:35.144
I'd like to introduce our newest member,

00:35.288 --> 00:37.831
James Gordon.

00:38.516 --> 00:41.495
Welcome to the Court of Owls.

00:47.725 --> 00:49.625
- Are you okay?
- I just remembered.

00:49.942 --> 00:52.238
There's someone I need to kill.

00:52.629 --> 00:55.059
This virus isn't a disease.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.323
It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

00:57.402 --> 00:58.634
I don't need a cure.

00:58.823 --> 01:00.761
I will purge Gotham

01:00.839 --> 01:03.198
and the innocents will thank me!

01:03.690 --> 01:05.632
Their savior!

01:05.823 --> 01:07.832
Their executioner.

01:08.830 --> 01:11.520
_

01:16.921 --> 01:20.465
Guilty. Guilty.

01:23.527 --> 01:25.144
What's this I see?

01:25.230 --> 01:28.142
Captain Barnes being escorted
away by the orderlies.

01:51.923 --> 01:54.590
Oh, who is this new player
that enters the fray?

02:10.827 --> 02:12.889
And with that, it was over.

02:13.045 --> 02:16.045
Leaving me to wonder what
mysterious forces are at play

02:16.080 --> 02:17.914
in the middle of the night.

02:22.053 --> 02:23.658
Captain Barnes.

02:23.755 --> 02:25.565
At last we meet.

02:25.924 --> 02:29.408
- Who are you?
- Let's just say I'm a fan.

02:30.085 --> 02:31.440
What do you want?

02:31.508 --> 02:32.974
The same thing you do,

02:33.109 --> 02:37.078
for Gotham to be judged
and the guilty punished.

02:37.445 --> 02:40.469
Well, then release me
and I'll do just that.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.493
Unfortunately...

02:43.013 --> 02:47.799
we're looking to pass sentence
on a much larger scale.

02:47.893 --> 02:50.081
And to do that we need
what's inside of you.

02:52.216 --> 02:53.449
The virus.

02:53.484 --> 02:55.518
Precisely. But don't worry.

02:55.553 --> 02:57.582
I'll make sure he doesn't drain you...

02:58.129 --> 03:00.051
completely.

03:05.457 --> 03:07.960
Hello, Captain.

03:08.171 --> 03:09.327
Strange.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.600
I'm sorry, Captain.

03:11.839 --> 03:13.981
This might sting.

03:24.022 --> 03:25.569
Hey, Lee.

03:26.381 --> 03:29.225
- What's this?
- My final report on Frank Gordon.

03:32.523 --> 03:33.855
Cause of death...

03:34.687 --> 03:36.546
homicide.

03:36.887 --> 03:38.486
I thought Jim's uncle killed himself.

03:39.163 --> 03:40.321
Did you?

03:40.844 --> 03:43.057
Look, I know you're upset.

03:43.617 --> 03:45.256
After everything you've been through...

03:45.281 --> 03:47.462
D-Don't. Don't you dare do that.

03:47.497 --> 03:49.631
- This is not about Mario.
- Then what's it about?

03:49.804 --> 03:52.132
Why are, why are you here?
What do you want me to do?

03:52.157 --> 03:54.351
Harvey, you are acting captain.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.404
I want you to open an investigation

03:56.439 --> 03:57.872
into the murder of Frank Gordon,

03:57.957 --> 03:59.541
and I think Jim should be questioned.

04:01.555 --> 04:04.512
You're accusing Jim
of killing his own uncle?

04:04.548 --> 04:06.664
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know,

04:06.783 --> 04:09.050
but I know that he is involved somehow,

04:09.226 --> 04:11.797
maybe not in his death,
but maybe in covering it up,

04:11.911 --> 04:13.922
making it look like a suicide.

04:15.091 --> 04:17.625
And I want to know who else is involved.

04:19.696 --> 04:22.897
Are you implying I'm involved as well?

04:24.616 --> 04:26.223
Tell me I'm wrong, Harvey.

04:26.358 --> 04:28.545
Tell me there's nothing else going on.

04:28.811 --> 04:31.539
Look me in the eyes
and tell me I'm crazy.

04:33.207 --> 04:35.309
You're not crazy, Lee.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.079
You're hurt.

04:38.285 --> 04:41.291
And there's nothing going on.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.629
We used to be friends, Harvey.

04:51.371 --> 04:52.927
I know you're covering for him.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.829
I don't know what he's involved in,

04:54.941 --> 04:56.574
but I'm gonna find out.

05:01.271 --> 05:03.237
The ruling council has decided

05:03.273 --> 05:07.475
to suspend all Court activity
in order to focus our attention

05:07.616 --> 05:09.710
on the preparations at hand.

05:10.046 --> 05:13.124
Gotham's judgment is imminent.

05:14.140 --> 05:15.416
To that end,

05:15.515 --> 05:16.918
any members who have not

05:16.943 --> 05:19.420
submitted their list
for review and approval

05:19.456 --> 05:20.644
should do so today.

05:21.136 --> 05:22.490
We are adjourned.

05:43.196 --> 05:44.998
Excuse me?

05:45.162 --> 05:46.396
Yeah?

05:46.506 --> 05:48.264
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

05:49.124 --> 05:50.391
Knock yourself out.

05:52.696 --> 05:54.195
Her name's Selina.

05:54.351 --> 05:55.820
Selina Kyle.

05:56.132 --> 05:57.765
She knew Barbara Kean.

05:58.132 --> 05:59.767
She used to hang out here.

06:00.296 --> 06:01.593
I think.

06:01.671 --> 06:02.737
You think?

06:02.784 --> 06:04.172
You don't sound real close.

06:04.207 --> 06:07.737
Oh, no, we were... kind of,

06:07.811 --> 06:09.954
but she was always
really bossy, you know?

06:10.013 --> 06:12.413
And then we got into this fight.
I was gone for awhile and...

06:12.462 --> 06:14.001
Yeah, I don't care.

06:20.915 --> 06:22.227
Try Gotham General.

06:24.294 --> 06:26.086
Did something happen to her?

06:26.617 --> 06:29.531
I heard she fell out of a window
and is in pretty bad shape.

07:06.469 --> 07:07.980
What are you doing in here?

07:16.846 --> 07:19.645
I was supposed to put down
my list of names, but...

07:19.916 --> 07:21.824
nobody told me what for.

07:22.137 --> 07:24.668
Loved ones are to be spared
from the coming judgment.

07:35.799 --> 07:37.298
Thank you.

07:59.589 --> 08:01.134
No.

08:02.048 --> 08:03.424
It can't be.

08:03.459 --> 08:06.064
I'm sorry, this ward is restricted.

08:06.196 --> 08:07.650
What happened to her?

08:12.148 --> 08:13.765
No idea.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.803
Police found her on the
street. Looks like she fell.

08:16.828 --> 08:17.905
Fell?

08:18.172 --> 08:19.697
That's impossible.

08:19.779 --> 08:21.278
Is she gonna be all right?

08:21.377 --> 08:22.510
No.

08:22.596 --> 08:24.078
What do you mean, "no"?

08:24.119 --> 08:25.534
Tell me she's gonna be all right.

08:25.894 --> 08:27.982
- She's gonna be all right.
- No.

08:28.089 --> 08:30.199
You're just saying that because I...

08:30.224 --> 08:31.953
...just...

08:31.988 --> 08:33.034
...tell me the truth.

08:34.049 --> 08:35.448
We've tried everything.

08:35.854 --> 08:38.491
All we can do now is
make her comfortable.

08:45.301 --> 08:47.634
Leave us and don't come back.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.293
Don't listen to them, Selina.

08:52.612 --> 08:54.488
They don't know what I know.

08:54.844 --> 08:56.610
They can't do what I can do.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.946
I will heal you.

08:59.666 --> 09:01.534
I promise.

09:08.501 --> 09:11.955
Isn't it enough, you holding
me against my will?

09:12.742 --> 09:16.651
Must you also hover while I work?

09:17.299 --> 09:19.266
I'd think you would prefer this

09:19.301 --> 09:21.979
to playing nursemaid to Fish Mooney.

09:22.304 --> 09:24.805
I was able to save Fish Mooney

09:24.840 --> 09:28.041
despite the fact that she had
one foot in the grave.

09:28.128 --> 09:31.044
I took it as a personal challenge.

09:32.663 --> 09:35.167
Grandstanding doesn't suit you.

09:35.718 --> 09:38.285
Were you able to accomplish
what we asked?

09:38.927 --> 09:40.554
See for yourself.

09:45.059 --> 09:47.083
Hello?

09:47.952 --> 09:49.463
What do you want from me?

09:50.077 --> 09:52.155
Someone tell me what's going on.

09:52.334 --> 09:55.335
Previously, the Alice Tetch
virus could only be transmitted

09:55.371 --> 09:58.038
through direct contact with her blood.

10:04.046 --> 10:06.112
What is that?

10:06.620 --> 10:08.979
Someone please help!

10:19.862 --> 10:21.100
We've done it.

10:21.381 --> 10:23.330
You've weaponized the virus.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.775
Pick it up.

10:36.126 --> 10:37.516
No.

10:39.252 --> 10:42.320
You win, and you go free.

10:43.315 --> 10:45.253
Pick up the stick,

10:45.288 --> 10:47.588
and defeat this man.

10:49.899 --> 10:50.958
You're lying!

10:50.994 --> 10:52.760
This is just another way
of manipulating me.

10:52.796 --> 10:55.563
Pick it up. Prove me wrong.

10:59.216 --> 11:01.630
All that pain and anger...

11:02.052 --> 11:03.833
you think it's strength.

11:03.940 --> 11:05.419
It's not.

11:05.542 --> 11:08.309
You think can harness it... you can't.

11:08.451 --> 11:10.513
You think it's part of you,

11:10.613 --> 11:12.180
but it doesn't have to be.

11:21.558 --> 11:24.725
Do you know why you were
so easily defeated?

11:24.894 --> 11:26.127
No.

11:26.256 --> 11:28.229
Your rage, Bruce.

11:28.341 --> 11:30.716
It blinds you.

11:31.367 --> 11:33.302
You seek to control it,

11:33.327 --> 11:37.739
and yet it controls you
and has ever since that night.

11:39.476 --> 11:44.471
Rage and pain are two sides
of the same coin.

11:44.547 --> 11:48.268
I can release you
from the pain of that night.

11:48.818 --> 11:50.640
And when I do,

11:51.121 --> 11:53.984
nothing will be able to stop you.

11:58.983 --> 12:00.083
<i>Listen, Jim,</i>

12:00.306 --> 12:02.530
we got a hit on the prints
you lifted off the mask.

12:02.565 --> 12:05.017
Kathryn's last name is Monroe.

12:05.168 --> 12:07.235
She's from one of Gotham's
oldest families.

12:07.270 --> 12:09.070
Her address is 450

12:09.105 --> 12:12.044
<i>- Clinton Ave...</i>
- Nice work, Harvey.

12:12.175 --> 12:14.602
Kathryn seems to be the only one
who knows what the weapon is.

12:14.626 --> 12:16.251
So what's the plan?

12:16.412 --> 12:18.246
Break in, see what I can find out.

12:18.281 --> 12:19.614
What do you think,

12:19.649 --> 12:21.555
she's keeping it
on her fireplace mantel?

12:21.580 --> 12:23.050
<i>I searched the Court chambers.</i>

12:23.123 --> 12:25.123
She isn't taking any chances
with the rank and file

12:25.155 --> 12:26.662
knowing what the weapon is.

12:26.756 --> 12:28.256
If there is something to find,

12:28.506 --> 12:30.558
- it'll be at her house.
<i>- That's a big risk.</i>

12:30.593 --> 12:32.727
You get caught, ball game over.

12:32.815 --> 12:34.128
<i>I don't have a choice.</i>

12:34.229 --> 12:36.906
Listen, Jim, about your uncle...

12:37.031 --> 12:39.133
Lee came into my office wanting to

12:39.219 --> 12:41.169
<i>open an investigation into his death.</i>

12:41.204 --> 12:44.498
<i>She asked me point blank
what you were doing.</i>

12:44.974 --> 12:46.240
What'd you say?

12:46.287 --> 12:47.352
<i>Nothing.</i>

12:47.544 --> 12:48.676
I lied.

12:50.295 --> 12:54.904
Jim, she seemed like she was
in a pretty dark place.

12:55.652 --> 12:56.951
Anything else?

12:57.664 --> 12:59.020
Uh, yeah.

12:59.055 --> 13:01.518
Not to add on, but I got a call
from a buddy of mine

13:01.543 --> 13:02.842
at Arkham last night.

13:02.867 --> 13:04.252
<i>Barnes was transferred.</i>

13:04.360 --> 13:06.594
- Transferred? To where?
<i>- We don't know.</i>

13:06.674 --> 13:10.430
I got Alvarez looking into it.
But don't worry, we will find him.

13:10.455 --> 13:13.067
- Thanks, Harvey.
<i>- Jim, be careful.</i>

13:20.879 --> 13:22.337
Oswald.

13:22.981 --> 13:24.433
Hello, Jim.

13:24.933 --> 13:28.799
Guess I shouldn't be surprised
you're still alive.

13:29.346 --> 13:32.140
Yes, I am quite hard to kill.

13:38.248 --> 13:40.282
I take it this isn't a social call.

13:40.418 --> 13:41.746
I'm looking for Ed.

13:41.818 --> 13:43.151
We have some unfinished business.

13:43.215 --> 13:46.449
And it turns out you are
the last one who saw him.

13:46.890 --> 13:49.391
Yeah, before he escaped police custody.

13:50.294 --> 13:51.326
"Escaped"?

13:51.380 --> 13:53.061
From the great Detective Gordon?

13:53.162 --> 13:54.563
I think not.

13:54.662 --> 13:58.264
Ed went on television
demanding information

13:58.289 --> 14:01.765
about a group that runs Gotham.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.738
A group called the "Court."

14:03.836 --> 14:06.508
And you called him and said
you had that information.

14:06.562 --> 14:09.177
- A ruse to get him to the GCPD.
- Perhaps.

14:09.273 --> 14:12.210
But then you arrest him,

14:12.562 --> 14:14.702
and, voilà, he disappears.

14:15.046 --> 14:18.163
Sorry, "escapes custody."

14:18.843 --> 14:21.423
Can you see how I might think

14:21.458 --> 14:23.325
you may have handed Ed off to this

14:23.471 --> 14:25.694
all-powerful group for some reason?

14:25.900 --> 14:28.771
For your own sake, Oswald, drop it.

14:28.919 --> 14:30.209
I knew it.

14:30.365 --> 14:33.966
You don't know anything.

14:34.071 --> 14:37.163
Trust me, let it go.

14:37.441 --> 14:40.249
Sorry, no can do.

14:40.811 --> 14:42.844
I assume the Court
doesn't like publicity,

14:42.879 --> 14:46.414
hence Ed's sudden disappearance
after his television debut.

14:46.638 --> 14:49.985
But that is exactly
what they're going to get.

14:50.067 --> 14:52.020
Unless they deal with me

14:52.055 --> 14:53.833
in a civilized and professional manner.

14:53.890 --> 14:57.028
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
facilitating something on my behalf.

14:59.229 --> 15:01.730
My number is the only one in here.

15:01.919 --> 15:03.765
I will expect a call
by the end of the day.

15:05.702 --> 15:08.270
Why do I get the sense
I'm being threatened?

15:10.569 --> 15:12.607
This is a favor, Jim.

15:12.819 --> 15:16.405
After all, we're old friends.

15:17.096 --> 15:19.047
Right?

16:43.700 --> 16:45.166
Talon?

16:47.022 --> 16:48.436
Yes, ma'am.

17:05.387 --> 17:07.324
Kathryn.

17:07.910 --> 17:09.710
Detective Gordon,
what is the meaning of this?

17:09.785 --> 17:11.059
Who let you in here?

17:11.175 --> 17:14.922
Oswald Cobblepot is alive
and back in Gotham.

17:15.365 --> 17:17.141
He paid me a visit this morning.

17:17.547 --> 17:21.102
He knows Nygma's disappearance
has something to do with the Court.

17:21.406 --> 17:22.604
Is that all?

17:23.921 --> 17:26.249
I'm tired of being kept in the dark.

17:26.366 --> 17:27.942
I want a seat at the table.

17:28.046 --> 17:29.844
How ambitious.

17:30.147 --> 17:32.735
You asked me to be on the Court.

17:32.883 --> 17:34.954
Now, I have done
everything you've asked.

17:35.024 --> 17:37.235
I think I've proved my commitment.

17:37.532 --> 17:39.287
I want to know what's going on.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.123
I want to know what
the judgment entails.

17:42.306 --> 17:45.226
And if you don't like what you hear?

17:45.681 --> 17:47.314
Try me.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.031
Gotham is sick.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.600
Crime and violence are so common

17:52.636 --> 17:55.358
the people have become numb to it.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.059
To heal the city,

17:57.174 --> 17:59.787
we have to force them to take notice.

18:00.842 --> 18:02.477
Force them how?

18:02.648 --> 18:06.414
By showing the people of Gotham
their darkest selves.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.688
I'll consider your request.

18:13.768 --> 18:16.353
Now leave my house at once.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.187
<i>It's Harvey. Leave a message.</i>

18:25.212 --> 18:28.056
Harvey, I know what the weapon is.

18:28.243 --> 18:30.743
I know how they're gonna
pass judgment on Gotham.

18:41.276 --> 18:43.877
The weapon is the Alice Tetch virus?

18:43.948 --> 18:45.604
Kathryn said the weapon would

18:45.629 --> 18:47.612
"show Gotham its darkest self."

18:47.691 --> 18:50.009
Alice Tetch was
in Indian Hill for years.

18:50.034 --> 18:51.314
They would have known about her.

18:51.392 --> 18:53.916
- It's the virus. I'm sure of it.
- Is that even possible?

18:54.242 --> 18:55.717
Well, that's why you're here, Lucius.

18:55.741 --> 18:58.221
I'm sorry to throw you into
the deep end of the pool like this,

18:58.327 --> 18:59.929
but I need to know
what we're up against.

19:00.046 --> 19:03.444
You mean beyond a secret society
that controls all of Gotham.

19:05.047 --> 19:06.291
Well, if they could isolate the virus

19:06.315 --> 19:07.914
they could transform it into any number

19:07.953 --> 19:09.416
of compounds that could be released

19:09.452 --> 19:11.164
on a large scale into the city.

19:11.287 --> 19:12.804
All they'd need is
a sample of her blood.

19:12.828 --> 19:14.460
Well, they ain't getting it
from the source.

19:14.484 --> 19:16.239
After Mario broke into
the hematology lab,

19:16.264 --> 19:18.319
they destroyed the rest
of Alice's blood.

19:18.661 --> 19:20.420
I mean, where do they get a sample?

19:20.702 --> 19:22.596
They don't need a sample
of Alice's blood,

19:22.632 --> 19:23.864
just a sample of the virus.

19:24.318 --> 19:26.967
The virus that she passed along
to the people she infected.

19:27.372 --> 19:29.169
- Barnes.
- Exactly.

19:29.271 --> 19:31.272
Barnes wasn't transferred out of Arkham,

19:31.992 --> 19:34.000
Kathryn kidnapped him.

19:34.086 --> 19:35.086
So...

19:35.149 --> 19:37.378
if we can find out where he was taken,
we can stop this.

19:37.532 --> 19:39.656
And how do we go about doing that?

19:40.851 --> 19:42.917
I found this in Kathryn's study.

19:43.070 --> 19:46.020
- Any idea what lab it belongs to?
- No.

19:46.281 --> 19:48.155
But when I was running

19:48.190 --> 19:50.257
the Wayne Enterprises R&D division,

19:50.293 --> 19:52.393
we only had a half dozen off-site labs.

19:52.985 --> 19:55.963
Barnes isn't exactly the kind of guy
who's gonna blend in.

19:56.126 --> 19:57.627
It'd have to be somewhere isolated,

19:57.698 --> 20:00.049
and small enough for them to control.

20:01.565 --> 20:03.103
I think I know where they took him.

20:14.884 --> 20:16.539
Just put them down
wherever there's space,

20:16.564 --> 20:18.063
and then go back to where I found you.

20:18.087 --> 20:19.153
Yes, ma'am.

20:21.057 --> 20:25.092
Selina, I would like to introduce you to

20:25.202 --> 20:26.593
Nepeta Cataria.

20:26.890 --> 20:30.228
Or, rather, a very specialized strain

20:30.274 --> 20:31.794
of a plant that I've been cultivating.

20:32.003 --> 20:36.423
This guy is a "break in case
of emergency" type of deal.

20:40.676 --> 20:42.855
You've always been there for me.

20:44.066 --> 20:46.613
Even when I screwed things up.

20:47.717 --> 20:49.529
Which was most of the time.

20:50.045 --> 20:51.896
Just breathe deep,

20:52.655 --> 20:54.855
and I'll be here when you wake up.

20:59.095 --> 21:00.756
Just wake up, okay?

21:07.107 --> 21:08.569
Are we going back to the alley

21:08.604 --> 21:10.239
where my parents were murdered?

21:10.309 --> 21:14.278
No. There's another memory
I want to start with.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.697
The first time you felt the rage
after your parents' death...

21:17.729 --> 21:20.296
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

21:20.401 --> 21:23.455
The rage from that day
continues to burn inside of you,

21:23.525 --> 21:24.801
feeding on your pain,

21:24.836 --> 21:26.803
blinding you from everything else,

21:26.838 --> 21:30.139
and, if left unchecked,
will one day consume you.

21:30.175 --> 21:32.827
We need to remove it
before that happens.

21:32.905 --> 21:35.144
You want me to give up
my memory of that day?

21:35.233 --> 21:38.781
No. The events themselves will remain.

21:38.817 --> 21:41.150
I'm only talking about
releasing you from

21:41.186 --> 21:44.420
the destructive emotions
connected with them.

21:44.753 --> 21:46.722
And if I don't want to be released?

21:46.823 --> 21:50.560
You have chosen your prison, Bruce.
I'm offering you a way out.

21:50.628 --> 21:51.961
Why?

21:52.074 --> 21:55.589
You said I was to become
the protector of Gotham.

21:55.934 --> 21:57.133
Why me?

21:57.168 --> 21:59.268
Because you need each other.

21:59.363 --> 22:01.691
Gotham needs a protector,

22:01.769 --> 22:04.722
and you need a purpose.

22:04.879 --> 22:08.111
I'm only trying to show you the way.

22:08.450 --> 22:10.446
But it has to be...

22:12.411 --> 22:14.223
...your choice.

22:24.696 --> 22:26.522
Do you know where you are?

22:26.983 --> 22:29.298
- My parents' wake.
- Yes.

22:29.499 --> 22:32.802
You were surrounded by friends
and family, and yet...

22:33.389 --> 22:35.599
I felt alone.

22:37.576 --> 22:40.036
This was the first
time I truly processed

22:40.099 --> 22:41.974
that my parents were gone.

22:43.482 --> 22:46.393
The first time I thought
of myself as an orphan.

22:46.948 --> 22:48.995
Is that why you left?

22:51.623 --> 22:52.846
No.

22:52.925 --> 22:54.558
Then why did you?

22:54.760 --> 22:56.449
I heard what they were saying.

22:59.798 --> 23:01.863
He witnessed the whole thing.

23:01.934 --> 23:04.468
- He must have been terrified.
- Devastated.

23:04.566 --> 23:06.461
Traumatized.

23:06.486 --> 23:10.352
My parents were dead, but all
anybody was talking about was me.

23:11.310 --> 23:13.571
How concerned they were about me.

23:14.298 --> 23:16.837
My parents had been murdered.

23:17.259 --> 23:19.160
Gunned down and left for
dead and nobody seemed...

23:19.184 --> 23:20.417
Angry.

23:20.501 --> 23:21.651
Yes.

23:21.727 --> 23:23.447
And so you left.

23:25.824 --> 23:27.491
I hid in my parents' room.

23:27.588 --> 23:30.452
My father was supposed to be
buried in a pair of cufflinks

23:30.514 --> 23:32.928
that I'd bought him for his
birthday the year before.

23:35.634 --> 23:37.434
He always said they were his favorite.

23:37.616 --> 23:40.037
But when it came time to give them up...

23:42.826 --> 23:44.875
...I couldn't let them go.

23:49.269 --> 23:51.235
It's time to let them go.

23:54.153 --> 23:55.668
There.

23:55.863 --> 23:58.372
You can lock it away, and once you do,

23:59.099 --> 24:02.583
you'll be free of the power
it holds over you.

24:15.073 --> 24:18.041
I've been waiting a long
time for this, Bruce.

24:18.164 --> 24:20.323
Together,

24:21.296 --> 24:24.058
we will make Gotham pay.

24:27.886 --> 24:29.973
No guards.

24:30.255 --> 24:32.343
No security.

24:32.524 --> 24:34.085
I don't like it, either.

24:48.874 --> 24:51.058
I guess we know where the guards went.

24:56.169 --> 24:57.581
Hello?

24:58.953 --> 25:00.788
GCPD. Freeze.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.445
The police, thank God.

25:02.554 --> 25:04.148
Keep your hands where we can see them!

25:04.173 --> 25:06.003
I didn't want to kill
these people, I-I...

25:06.112 --> 25:07.714
I just lost control.

25:07.847 --> 25:10.230
On the ground, now. Now!

25:10.308 --> 25:11.925
I'm the good guy here.

25:11.975 --> 25:14.920
Oh, you're just like them.
You're out to get me.

25:41.150 --> 25:42.958
What have you done with the virus?

25:43.295 --> 25:44.803
Who has it?

25:45.006 --> 25:46.889
A woman, named Kathryn.

25:46.951 --> 25:49.271
- Where is she? Where's she taken it?
- I don't know.

25:49.365 --> 25:51.966
As I told you, I was
brought here against my will.

25:52.001 --> 25:53.348
I know nothing of their other plans.

25:53.372 --> 25:55.179
Hugo Strange, you're under arrest

25:55.234 --> 25:57.679
for attempts to weaponize a viral...

25:58.007 --> 25:59.373
hell, you know why.

25:59.409 --> 26:02.500
Oh, you don't want to do that.

26:02.579 --> 26:05.341
The delivery mechanism
that they plan to use

26:05.388 --> 26:06.896
to release the virus

26:06.975 --> 26:08.904
just recently arrived.

26:09.014 --> 26:11.189
The shipment that came into dock 9C.

26:11.252 --> 26:13.613
Yes. It still needs to be tested,

26:13.649 --> 26:15.448
which means that
you still have enough time

26:15.484 --> 26:18.276
to keep them from
unleashing it citywide.

26:18.331 --> 26:19.286
But, of course,

26:19.311 --> 26:22.643
if they discover that their
lab has been compromised...

26:22.724 --> 26:25.729
He's right, they might
unleash it right away.

26:25.927 --> 26:27.394
We can't take him in

26:27.450 --> 26:29.229
or the Court will know we're onto them.

26:29.264 --> 26:31.564
Are you crazy? What if
he's yanking our chain?

26:31.600 --> 26:34.567
What stops him from picking up the phone
and calling the owl brigade

26:34.603 --> 26:37.503
- the second we walk out that door?
- My research.

26:37.605 --> 26:41.159
And a vial of my virus compound

26:41.214 --> 26:44.680
which I secreted away,
unbeknownst to my captors.

26:44.797 --> 26:47.352
A token of goodwill,

26:47.416 --> 26:51.539
which I hope will be remembered
when the time comes.

26:52.054 --> 26:53.872
Goodwill?

26:54.089 --> 26:55.997
You're playing both sides.

26:56.091 --> 26:58.158
You help us take down
the Court and what?

26:58.193 --> 26:59.779
We cut you a deal?

27:00.095 --> 27:01.873
But we fail,

27:02.097 --> 27:05.318
and you appear to be loyal
to the Court, is that it?

27:05.567 --> 27:07.810
You logical bastard.

27:07.903 --> 27:09.684
Don't worry about the mess.

27:09.771 --> 27:13.606
We have our poor test
subject to blame for that.

27:21.840 --> 27:24.426
Good luck, detectives.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.977
Get Lucius the virus
compound and the research.

27:28.002 --> 27:29.657
See if he can find anyone we can trust

27:29.682 --> 27:31.236
to start working on the cure.

27:31.372 --> 27:32.479
Where you going?

27:32.588 --> 27:35.962
I gotta find out where
Kathryn's testing the bomb.

27:44.189 --> 27:45.616
Kathryn?

27:45.674 --> 27:47.281
<i>I've thought about what you said.</i>

27:47.379 --> 27:49.491
<i>You have done what we've asked.</i>

27:49.570 --> 27:52.875
Maybe it is time to take the next step.

27:52.981 --> 27:55.148
<i>Meet me at 331 Smith Place.</i>

27:55.210 --> 27:56.773
Can't give me any more than that?

27:56.876 --> 27:59.673
<i>You said you didn't want
to be kept in the dark.</i>

27:59.860 --> 28:02.493
Let's see if you're worthy of the light.

28:12.643 --> 28:14.673
Is that all you have?

28:14.830 --> 28:17.771
I thought you wanted
to leave this place.

28:19.441 --> 28:20.740
That's it!

28:22.010 --> 28:24.224
That's it.

28:27.280 --> 28:28.314
Yes.

28:29.944 --> 28:34.538
See what you can accomplish once
you remove destructive emotions?

28:34.741 --> 28:36.460
Tell me,

28:36.897 --> 28:39.392
how did you feel when you
were fighting this time?

28:42.049 --> 28:43.775
I felt...

28:48.064 --> 28:49.959
...nothing.

28:52.928 --> 28:54.131
I beat him.

28:54.444 --> 28:56.147
Does that mean I can leave?

29:00.549 --> 29:04.651
Is that what you want?
The pain to go away?

29:04.686 --> 29:06.809
I can take it away, Bruce.

29:06.855 --> 29:10.623
I can take it away
and you can return to Gotham

29:10.659 --> 29:13.465
with a power you never thought possible.

29:13.676 --> 29:15.559
It's your choice.

29:24.272 --> 29:25.839
Get up.

29:27.275 --> 29:28.541
We're not done.

29:39.888 --> 29:41.266
James.

29:41.456 --> 29:42.889
Glad you could make it.

29:43.156 --> 29:44.961
Not sure I had a choice.

29:45.026 --> 29:46.993
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you

29:47.028 --> 29:48.397
for your gun and your phone.

30:12.396 --> 30:13.810
Nice party.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.288
The daughters of Gotham.

30:15.560 --> 30:19.359
Socialites who believe they hold
the power in this city,

30:19.491 --> 30:22.319
when really what they really
are is window dressing.

30:23.398 --> 30:26.295
My family was one of
the first in Gotham.

30:26.545 --> 30:28.868
We've been on the Court
since its founding,

30:28.977 --> 30:31.149
making the difficult decisions

30:31.368 --> 30:33.406
to ensure its long-term survival.

30:34.462 --> 30:37.140
Which is why I've brought you here.

30:41.171 --> 30:43.436
Interesting centerpiece.

30:44.088 --> 30:46.452
It's an aerosol dispersal bomb.

30:47.768 --> 30:49.596
Dispersal bomb for what?

30:49.758 --> 30:52.241
For the Alice Tetch virus.

30:55.797 --> 30:57.743
So that's what you meant
by showing Gotham

30:57.798 --> 30:59.986
- its darkest self.
- Precisely.

31:00.011 --> 31:02.535
Infecting 200 people
won't change anything.

31:02.618 --> 31:07.088
True. But the virus compound
only lives in aerated form

31:07.149 --> 31:09.276
for a matter of minutes, so,

31:09.344 --> 31:11.511
in a closed space like the room below,

31:11.546 --> 31:13.246
it will be contained to our guests.

31:13.432 --> 31:15.582
But in an open space,

31:15.831 --> 31:19.110
the radius of infection is a half mile.

31:19.387 --> 31:21.354
This is merely a test.

31:39.773 --> 31:41.438
Place it in the middle of the room.

31:45.656 --> 31:47.814
Don't worry, you'll be safe up here.

31:47.860 --> 31:50.979
I need to trust that you're ready to make

31:51.033 --> 31:54.299
the difficult decisions
when the time comes.

31:54.389 --> 31:55.641
That's why I'm here.

31:55.757 --> 31:56.844
Good.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.558
Because if it's not,

31:58.719 --> 32:02.149
if you try to stop the bomb

32:02.329 --> 32:04.149
or interfere in any way,

32:04.274 --> 32:08.197
Talon has instructions
to execute you on the spot.

32:19.723 --> 32:21.988
Talon, right?

32:22.161 --> 32:23.911
I'm assuming that's a nickname.

32:25.418 --> 32:27.315
Right.

32:27.403 --> 32:29.584
Wouldn't want to miss out
on the sounds of 200 people

32:29.620 --> 32:31.953
tearing each other's throats out.

32:36.689 --> 32:39.509
The device is in place.

32:49.973 --> 32:51.673
Hello, Jim.

32:51.767 --> 32:54.142
I was beginning to think
I wasn't going to hear from you.

32:54.251 --> 32:56.244
<i>I met you the other night, didn't I?</i>

32:56.415 --> 32:57.923
<i>When you took Nygma?</i>

32:58.004 --> 32:59.472
- Jim?
- <i>I keep wondering...</i>

32:59.516 --> 33:01.809
...what it is the Court
is planning to do with him.

33:01.952 --> 33:03.701
Stop talking.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.125
This used to be a bank, right?

33:08.292 --> 33:09.958
<i>First Bank of Gotham?</i>

33:10.156 --> 33:13.554
<i>I just hope it can withstand
whatever the bomb's going to do to it.</i>

33:13.664 --> 33:15.263
It sounds like we don't have much time.

33:15.299 --> 33:16.460
Shut up.

33:16.825 --> 33:18.632
Sure.

33:31.381 --> 33:32.547
Where's Jim?

33:32.650 --> 33:34.275
He's not responding to my calls.

33:34.345 --> 33:35.486
I'm heading into the bullpen

33:35.534 --> 33:37.290
to see if anyone's heard from him.

33:43.555 --> 33:44.765
What's going on?

33:45.202 --> 33:47.563
- Hey, Lee.
- Are you helping Jim?

33:48.868 --> 33:50.415
Bullock, I get.

33:50.524 --> 33:52.734
But has Jim also pulled you
into his madness?

33:52.759 --> 33:54.674
- It's not madness, Lee.
- Then what is it?

33:55.806 --> 33:58.024
How many people does he have to kill

33:58.087 --> 34:00.665
- before you all see what I see?
- You got it wrong.

34:00.782 --> 34:03.345
Jim's trying to make sure
that what happened to Mario

34:03.380 --> 34:04.760
never happens to anyone again.

34:04.814 --> 34:06.127
What are you talking about?

34:08.924 --> 34:10.424
Lucius.

34:10.525 --> 34:12.559
Please, just tell me what's going on.

34:15.264 --> 34:16.821
I can't.

34:16.985 --> 34:18.360
I'm sorry, Lee.

34:18.688 --> 34:21.060
You're just like everybody else here.

34:38.897 --> 34:40.253
Screw it.

35:13.195 --> 35:14.821
Duck!

35:27.569 --> 35:28.869
Everyone out!

35:28.950 --> 35:30.325
Now!

35:34.270 --> 35:36.317
Took you long enough.

35:36.570 --> 35:39.224
- I need to get these people out of here.
- And I need to talk to the Court.

35:39.248 --> 35:40.714
Have them turn over Ed. Remember?

35:40.749 --> 35:42.315
There is a bomb down there

35:42.351 --> 35:44.256
with a weaponized version
of the Alice Tetch virus.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.866
If you want to be here when
it goes off, be my guest.

35:47.163 --> 35:50.197
- What about our deal?
- You just torched their assassin.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.466
My guess is, they'll be in touch.

36:03.600 --> 36:07.108
Mommy! Mom!

36:09.518 --> 36:11.491
Mommy!

36:11.587 --> 36:13.520
My daughter. Where's my daughter?!

36:43.931 --> 36:45.097
Yes, sir.

36:45.143 --> 36:47.120
Hello, Kathryn.

36:47.237 --> 36:50.668
- My apologies for the time.
- Not at all.

36:50.832 --> 36:52.965
How are things progressing
with Bruce Wayne?

36:53.027 --> 36:53.901
<i>Excellent.</i>

36:53.952 --> 36:56.667
He believes in the destiny
I have promised,

36:56.729 --> 36:59.393
in a life free
from the pain of his past.

36:59.458 --> 37:02.029
The boy and I will be leaving tonight.

37:02.146 --> 37:06.193
<i>I trust everything will be
in place by the time we arrive.</i>

37:06.256 --> 37:07.467
Of course.

37:07.532 --> 37:09.332
Why haven't they made contact?

37:09.451 --> 37:12.936
And where the hell is Ivy
and the human popsicle?

37:14.428 --> 37:15.772
Hello?

37:15.889 --> 37:18.314
Are you listening to me?

37:33.371 --> 37:34.703
You're awake.

37:34.807 --> 37:36.370
Selina!

37:36.893 --> 37:38.528
Are you okay?

37:39.169 --> 37:41.466
Say something
so that I know you're okay.

37:42.606 --> 37:46.487
Why does my room smell like
a giant bag of potpourri?

37:48.240 --> 37:50.706
Oh! You're back.

37:51.026 --> 37:53.309
Oh, I can't believe it.

37:59.233 --> 38:01.151
Oh, wait.

38:01.263 --> 38:03.775
What are you doing?

38:04.089 --> 38:06.681
You just got out of a coma.
You need to rest.

38:06.853 --> 38:08.224
This can't wait.

38:09.126 --> 38:10.564
What are you talking about?

38:10.642 --> 38:11.853
Where are you going?

38:12.244 --> 38:14.411
To Wayne Manor.

38:15.926 --> 38:17.466
To kill someone.

38:25.676 --> 38:26.863
What are you doing?

38:26.950 --> 38:29.309
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm leaving.

38:29.981 --> 38:32.767
Well, actually, I'm resigning,
and then I'm leaving.

38:32.939 --> 38:34.595
Don't. You belong here.

38:34.775 --> 38:36.089
I thought I did.

38:36.951 --> 38:39.756
Then you infected this place
and everyone around you.

38:40.928 --> 38:42.334
I'm done.

38:42.537 --> 38:45.615
I am done with you, with the GCPD...

38:46.287 --> 38:47.809
with Gotham.

38:48.255 --> 38:49.745
What are you talking about?

38:49.872 --> 38:51.857
You've taken everything away from me.

38:51.986 --> 38:53.385
Everything.

38:53.513 --> 38:55.251
There's nothing left.

38:55.653 --> 38:57.493
And for what?

38:57.888 --> 39:00.610
I would ask you for the truth,

39:00.791 --> 39:04.383
but I honestly don't even think
you know what that is anymore.

39:05.249 --> 39:07.015
You want the truth?

39:07.335 --> 39:08.765
Fine.

39:09.288 --> 39:11.187
I killed Mario.

39:11.530 --> 39:13.402
I'm done apologizing for it.

39:13.671 --> 39:15.037
He was gonna kill you.

39:15.155 --> 39:17.444
- No.
- I saw the knife.

39:17.804 --> 39:19.562
I saw the knife
and I pulled the trigger.

39:19.624 --> 39:21.413
And I would do it again.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.591
- He was infected.
- Yes.

39:23.661 --> 39:27.778
Because Jervis Tetch
wanted to punish you. You!

39:27.888 --> 39:30.290
Not Mario. Mario didn't deserve
what happened to him.

39:30.315 --> 39:32.461
You want to blame me
for Mario's death, fine!

39:32.485 --> 39:34.319
You want to walk out that door
and never come back,

39:34.343 --> 39:35.343
I can't stop you.

39:35.396 --> 39:37.342
But it will not help.

39:38.342 --> 39:40.357
Believe me.

39:48.946 --> 39:52.478
The other day, you asked me at Mario's
grave how I could walk away.

39:53.586 --> 39:55.051
Move on.

39:58.269 --> 39:59.808
I guess you know how.

40:38.876 --> 40:41.133
My name is Oswald Cobblepot.

40:41.186 --> 40:42.758
You cannot do this to me.

40:42.821 --> 40:45.555
I demand to speak
to the person in charge!

40:45.860 --> 40:47.873
Oswald.

40:54.537 --> 40:56.280
You're alive?

41:39.231 --> 41:43.665
I want to apologize
for my curt behavior earlier.

41:44.266 --> 41:47.204
We both want the same thing for Gotham.

41:48.328 --> 41:50.438
Judgment.

41:51.663 --> 41:55.264
But I have just discovered
someone I thought was loyal

41:55.327 --> 41:58.616
has been deceiving me from the start.

41:58.970 --> 42:01.139
Detective James Gordon

42:01.209 --> 42:05.397
now threatens to undo what we both seek.

42:07.592 --> 42:11.845
I need you to kill him
before he can do that.

42:29.602 --> 42:33.143
Jim Gordon is guilty.

42:33.434 --> 42:37.395
And I will be his executioner.
