04:47.791 --> 04:50.878
- Hey, Lucky, how you doing?
- You're nothing.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.012
You're nothing.

04:53.092 --> 04:54.924
Thank you.

05:00.325 --> 05:03.013
- Good morning, sweetheart.
- Hi, doll.

05:03.093 --> 05:06.725
Plenty of cream and sugar,
just like you like it.

05:12.058 --> 05:13.590
Perfect.

05:19.258 --> 05:20.945
Lucky!

05:21.624 --> 05:23.079
Oh, God.

05:23.158 --> 05:26.359
- Those things are gonna kill you.
- If they could've, they would've.

06:10.525 --> 06:13.443
- All right, see you.
- Oh, okay.

06:13.523 --> 06:15.926
Bye, Lucky. See you, Joe.

06:16.826 --> 06:18.365
What you stuck on now?

06:20.291 --> 06:21.804
Uh...

06:21.984 --> 06:24.466
...seven-letter word for augur...

06:24.546 --> 06:27.544
...A-U-G-U-R.

06:32.657 --> 06:34.478
I know.

06:34.558 --> 06:36.277
Go on, honey.

06:36.357 --> 06:37.645
Portend.

06:37.725 --> 06:40.835
Portend. P-O-R-T-E-N-D.

06:40.915 --> 06:43.078
That's it. Thank you, dear.

06:43.158 --> 06:44.970
Give me that.

06:46.057 --> 06:47.278
Well, this is easy.

06:47.358 --> 06:50.479
I mean, what you gonna do
when you get the Sunday puzzle?

06:50.859 --> 06:52.747
Give me another.

06:54.524 --> 06:56.044
All right...

06:56.124 --> 07:00.344
...a three-letter word
for asshole starting with a "J"?

07:02.191 --> 07:03.781
Clever.

07:04.539 --> 07:06.359
Very clever.

08:13.391 --> 08:14.957
Cunts!

08:23.258 --> 08:26.724
- <i>Buenos días,</i> Lucky.
- <i>Buenos días.</i>

08:52.191 --> 08:55.297
- How are you today?
- So far, so good.

08:58.292 --> 09:01.985
- Who's that again?
- That's my youngest son, Juan.

09:02.065 --> 09:04.878
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's John in English.

09:05.558 --> 09:08.557
Like John Wayne. Juan Wayne.

09:09.324 --> 09:11.612
He's gonna be ten on Saturday.

09:11.692 --> 09:14.381
- Oh, that's great.
- It's his birthday.

09:15.358 --> 09:17.644
Well, I gotta go. My shows are on.

09:27.158 --> 09:29.110
Juan Wayne.

09:29.190 --> 09:31.057
Juan Wayne.

09:35.390 --> 09:37.078
<i>Go ahead and tell us about yourself.</i>

09:37.158 --> 09:39.830
<i>Hi, I'm Stephanie Moreno!
I'm from Pueblo, Colorado...</i>

09:39.909 --> 09:42.278
<i>...and I'm here to make some money!</i>

09:42.358 --> 09:44.400
<i>Hi, I'm David Mulbec. I'm from Chicago...</i>

09:44.480 --> 09:46.945
<i>...and I'm here to make some money!</i>

09:47.825 --> 09:50.135
<i>Hi, I'm Marlene Moscavitz,
Ann Arbor, Michigan...</i>

09:50.215 --> 09:52.424
<i>...and I'm here to make some money!</i>

09:54.025 --> 09:57.055
<i>Join us and find out who's gonna
walk away with a brand, new car...</i>

09:57.135 --> 09:59.145
...<i>on,</i> Take a Guess.

09:59.924 --> 10:02.311
<i>Have you been turned down
for life insurance? If you are...</i>

10:02.391 --> 10:06.418
- They always yell at ya.
- <i>...you can obtain full-term li...</i>

10:18.991 --> 10:20.824
Oh, shit.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.691
Is realism a thing?

10:47.190 --> 10:49.277
Okay, so it's a thing, huh?

10:49.757 --> 10:53.358
All right, and that's, uh, seven letters.

10:55.492 --> 10:57.121
Hold on a minute.

11:09.424 --> 11:11.244
Okay.

11:11.324 --> 11:13.325
"Realism, noun."

11:13.691 --> 11:18.423
"The attitude or practice
of accepting a situation as it is...

11:18.503 --> 11:22.590
...and being prepared
to deal with it accordingly."

11:23.624 --> 11:25.591
Now the other one.

11:25.825 --> 11:30.210
"The quality or fact representing
a person, thing...

11:30.290 --> 11:32.539
...or situation accurately...

11:32.619 --> 11:36.872
...or in a way that is true to life.

11:46.658 --> 11:49.344
I always thought
that what we all agreed on...

11:49.424 --> 11:52.312
...was what we were looking at,
but that's bullshit...

11:52.392 --> 11:55.657
...because what I see
is not necessarily what you see.

12:00.890 --> 12:02.425
Realism.

12:03.692 --> 12:06.851
R-E-A...

12:06.931 --> 12:08.944
...L-I...

12:09.024 --> 12:11.464
That's it. That's some heavy shit.

12:13.224 --> 12:15.257
She's gonna blow it.

12:18.058 --> 12:19.811
<i>The Dark Ages?</i>

12:19.891 --> 12:23.690
<i>No, I'm sorry. The answer you're
looking for is "the Renaissance."</i>

12:24.557 --> 12:28.224
You blew it, honey.
There goes your fucking Buick.

12:33.307 --> 12:37.120
Okay, pal. Goodbye, I'll talk to you later.

12:50.991 --> 12:54.325
Now you know me,
I don't like to cause a scene.

12:54.425 --> 12:57.878
Hey, fuck you, I don't.

12:58.358 --> 13:01.798
So that night, I decided to have
a coming-to-God meeting.

13:01.878 --> 13:05.412
I locked the front door and sent
everybody back into the kitchen.

13:05.492 --> 13:09.662
Took down my Saturday Night
Special over there. And I said, "Gentlemen...

13:09.742 --> 13:13.086
...if you want to fuck me,
and I know you do...

13:13.166 --> 13:15.499
...you should buy me dinner first."

13:15.579 --> 13:18.403
Then I drew that peace-maker...

13:19.790 --> 13:22.524
...two rounds in the ceiling and I said...

13:23.525 --> 13:25.488
"...I know...

13:25.568 --> 13:29.472
...that all of you are stealing from me.

13:31.924 --> 13:35.558
Just don't get greedy."

13:37.291 --> 13:40.144
And I've been in the black ever since.

13:41.925 --> 13:45.544
I see her standing there,
the room was filled with gun smoke.

13:45.623 --> 13:48.911
And everyone's just shitting
their goddamn pants.

13:49.351 --> 13:51.624
I tell you, the sexiest thing I'd ever seen.

13:51.704 --> 13:54.512
I wooed him with my feminine charm.

13:54.591 --> 13:57.124
Nothing but class with this one.

13:57.758 --> 13:59.512
Charmed.

13:59.591 --> 14:02.024
You were good to Momma last night.

14:02.492 --> 14:04.994
Lucky! Bloody Maria?

14:05.074 --> 14:06.960
<i>Por favor.</i>

14:07.040 --> 14:09.444
- Lucky!
- Hey, Paulie.

14:09.524 --> 14:11.357
What's the good word?

14:12.425 --> 14:15.178
Realism is a thing.

14:15.258 --> 14:17.378
Oh, yeah? How do you mean?

14:17.458 --> 14:21.268
It's the practice of accepting a situation...

14:21.348 --> 14:23.244
...as it is...

14:23.457 --> 14:28.311
...and being prepared
to deal with it accordingly.

14:28.391 --> 14:32.388
So what you're saying is,
"What you see is what you get."

14:32.468 --> 14:35.643
But what you see is not what I get.

14:35.723 --> 14:37.257
Okay.

14:41.757 --> 14:44.044
- Elaine!
- What?

14:44.124 --> 14:46.619
Realism is a thing.

14:46.699 --> 14:48.747
- What?
- Realism.

14:48.827 --> 14:50.297
Here we go again.

14:51.024 --> 14:54.077
Vincent, hand me my gun.

14:54.556 --> 14:58.224
Easy, partner. You're a misdemeanor
fucking with a felony.

15:06.458 --> 15:08.145
Hey, Howard.

15:08.225 --> 15:11.691
- Howie, what are you drinking?
- Something strong.

15:14.050 --> 15:15.545
What's the matter, Howard?

15:16.524 --> 15:19.902
- President Roosevelt escaped.
- What are you talking about?

15:19.982 --> 15:22.550
- Presidents.
- Which one?

15:22.630 --> 15:24.444
- Roosevelt.
- Yeah, which one?

15:24.523 --> 15:28.643
No, my tortoise,
President Roosevelt, he escaped.

15:28.723 --> 15:31.377
How does a hundred-year-old tortoise escape?

15:31.457 --> 15:34.010
I left the gate open
when I went to check the mail.

15:34.090 --> 15:36.757
Where is your mailbox, Europe?

15:38.591 --> 15:40.991
I saw him eyeing that gate the other day.

15:41.737 --> 15:44.144
He had to have timed it out perfectly.

15:44.224 --> 15:46.311
I searched our entire neighborhood.

15:46.391 --> 15:48.824
Did you search your entire yard?

15:49.191 --> 15:51.880
Hey, we're talking about
his best friend here!

15:51.960 --> 15:54.945
- Thank you, Lucky.
- You're welcome, Howard.

15:55.025 --> 15:58.090
You're right, you're right, I'm sorry.
We shouldn't make fun.

15:59.357 --> 16:03.556
I'm gonna miss him.
He's outlived two of my wives.

16:05.292 --> 16:08.325
- I'm going to the W.C.
- Okay, pal.

16:09.957 --> 16:11.724
You know...

16:12.164 --> 16:15.776
...friendship between animals and humans...

16:15.856 --> 16:18.867
...is essential and special.

16:19.546 --> 16:22.823
And friendship is essential to the soul.

16:25.057 --> 16:26.345
What?

16:26.425 --> 16:29.544
Friendship is essential to the soul.

16:29.624 --> 16:31.623
It doesn't exist!

16:32.290 --> 16:34.500
- What, friendship?
- The soul!

16:34.580 --> 16:37.823
Hey, knucklehead, inside voices!

16:38.324 --> 16:40.840
Hey, you gonna let your woman
talk to me that way?

16:40.920 --> 16:43.745
I'm not his woman. He's my man.

16:44.424 --> 16:48.176
As far as I'm concerned, he's just
been renting a room for 30 years.

16:49.025 --> 16:51.945
- Sonny and Cher.
- I'll drink to that.

16:52.025 --> 16:54.643
Hey, you know they got divorced.

16:54.723 --> 16:56.924
Good thing we never got married.

18:27.590 --> 18:29.824
Jesus Christ.

18:54.290 --> 18:57.523
Jesus! God, this thing.

18:58.590 --> 19:01.124
Can you... never mind.

19:03.657 --> 19:06.723
Oh, God. Oh, God.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.389
Oh, God.

19:11.557 --> 19:13.025
Why?

19:15.391 --> 19:19.012
- Hey, buddy. How the hell are you doing?
- You tell me.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.578
115 over 70, great.

19:25.658 --> 19:27.543
Thank you, Debbie.

19:32.324 --> 19:34.811
No broken bones. That's good.

19:35.540 --> 19:38.811
CT scan was negative, no sign of concussion.

19:39.191 --> 19:42.376
Blood pressure is good, heart is great.

19:42.456 --> 19:44.828
Lungs are great, even though you smoke.

19:44.908 --> 19:48.170
- How many packs a day?
- I don't know, maybe one.

19:48.249 --> 19:50.823
Well, I really have no explanation for that.

19:51.823 --> 19:54.376
It's a mystery,
some sort of scientific anomaly.

19:54.456 --> 19:57.342
All I can figure is it's a combination
of genetic good luck...

19:57.422 --> 19:59.311
...and you're one tough son of a bitch.

19:59.391 --> 20:01.344
I would try to get you to quit smoking...

20:01.424 --> 20:03.878
...but I'm afraid it would
do you more harm than good.

20:03.958 --> 20:06.257
You're the only person I would say that to.

20:07.357 --> 20:09.210
So, that's it?

20:09.290 --> 20:11.152
To be clear...

20:11.604 --> 20:13.807
...you were just standing there
and you got light-headed?

20:13.887 --> 20:16.476
- I didn't get light-headed.
- So you just fell down?

20:16.556 --> 20:18.931
Yeah. It was weird.

20:20.724 --> 20:22.017
Well...

20:22.097 --> 20:25.950
...I'll wait for these lab tests to come back
and then I'll let you know about that.

20:26.991 --> 20:28.806
That's it?

20:28.886 --> 20:31.376
- That's it.
- I'm not dying?

20:31.456 --> 20:34.590
When it comes to most things like
heart disease or cancer, at your age...

20:34.670 --> 20:37.511
- ...if it was gonna kill you, it would've.
- So?

20:37.591 --> 20:41.045
Short of shooting you with a silver bullet
or stabbing you with a wooden stake...

20:41.125 --> 20:44.832
...it seems the older you get,
the longer you're gonna live.

20:44.912 --> 20:47.228
So, but why did I fall down?

20:48.623 --> 20:50.877
- Were you drunk?
- No.

20:50.957 --> 20:54.583
- Do you get light-headed often?
- I don't get light-headed.

20:54.663 --> 20:58.210
- Now do you get much exercise?
- Yeah, I walk around all the time.

20:58.290 --> 21:03.474
I do five yoga exercises every day,
twenty-one repetitions each, for years.

21:03.554 --> 21:06.623
- Do your knees ever give out?
- No.

21:09.657 --> 21:12.310
I could do a lot more tests,
but I think it's gonna turn out to be...

21:12.390 --> 21:15.258
- ...exactly what I think it is.
- What's that?

21:15.338 --> 21:18.544
You're old, and you're getting older.

21:18.624 --> 21:21.300
- That's your diagnosis?
- It's all I got.

21:21.380 --> 21:23.810
Well, that's bullshit.

21:24.757 --> 21:27.277
The body is gonna break down at some point.

21:27.357 --> 21:30.710
As far as I know, nobody has lived forever.
It's gonna happen to all of us.

21:30.790 --> 21:35.310
I can do more tests, but I don't want to
do that and you don't want to have it done.

21:35.390 --> 21:38.222
So what am I supposed to do?

21:38.556 --> 21:41.344
At this point,
I think it might be a good idea...

21:41.424 --> 21:43.701
...to get an assisted
living person hooked up.

21:43.781 --> 21:45.670
- What?
- Assisted living.

21:45.750 --> 21:48.945
They come by and they help you
cook meals, help you bathe.

21:49.025 --> 21:51.711
Oh, I don't know, I'm on my own.

21:52.390 --> 21:54.143
You never get lonely being alone?

21:54.223 --> 21:58.470
There is a difference between
being lonely and alone.

22:00.091 --> 22:02.744
You know, I saw this happen with my father.

22:03.024 --> 22:06.444
He started to lose his eyesight,
and with it his ability to drive.

22:06.524 --> 22:10.812
It wasn't getting older that bothered him,
it was the loss of his freedom, his mobility.

22:11.291 --> 22:15.111
It's all fine as long as you realize
it's all part of the process.

22:17.157 --> 22:18.977
Well, how is your old man?

22:19.057 --> 22:21.856
Oh, buddy, he died a year ago.

22:23.243 --> 22:24.791
Wow.

22:26.691 --> 22:28.491
It was peaceful.

22:34.423 --> 22:36.276
You know, most people
don't get to where you are.

22:36.356 --> 22:39.076
They get hit by a bus
or get leukemia or something.

22:39.156 --> 22:42.144
They never get to the moment
that you're in right now.

22:42.224 --> 22:45.737
We have the ability to witness what you're
going through, and clearly examine it...

22:45.817 --> 22:48.690
...and, more importantly, to accept it.

22:49.723 --> 22:51.745
I know that's kind of heavy
for this hour of the morning...

22:51.825 --> 22:54.041
...but you're in exceptional health
for a person your age...

22:54.120 --> 22:57.689
...and if you need anything whatsoever,
you call me or you just come by.

22:58.758 --> 23:00.257
Okay.

23:00.991 --> 23:04.246
You've been very good today,
so you get one of these.

23:05.090 --> 23:07.491
What do I do with this, stick it up my ass?

23:08.424 --> 23:10.224
How about you just suck it?

23:28.551 --> 23:30.390
Oh, boy.

24:01.989 --> 24:03.291
You're nothing!

24:06.491 --> 24:08.057
Yeah.

24:28.874 --> 24:30.577
Everyday with this guy.

24:30.657 --> 24:33.143
Kneedler said it was all right
for me to smoke.

24:33.223 --> 24:35.560
Not in here.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.744
- And when did Kneedler ever say that?
- This morning.

24:38.824 --> 24:41.844
Oh, you know, I was getting a little worried.

24:41.924 --> 24:45.289
Bet you was getting that prostate checked.

24:45.990 --> 24:48.190
I fell.

24:49.391 --> 24:51.824
On my bony ass, I fell.

24:58.290 --> 25:01.427
- Are you okay?
- That's subjective.

25:01.507 --> 25:05.277
Pam! Loretta! Lucky fell down!

25:05.357 --> 25:07.878
Let's not make a production out of it!

25:07.957 --> 25:11.010
- Well, what did Kneedler say?
- He said I'm old.

25:11.790 --> 25:14.810
- And that's news to you?
- Did he give you anything?

25:14.890 --> 25:17.910
I don't know, man, it's all bullshit.

25:17.990 --> 25:19.624
Wait, where you going?

25:52.424 --> 25:53.924
Cunts!

26:02.357 --> 26:05.224
- <i>Buenos días.</i>
- <i>Buenos días.</i>

26:06.024 --> 26:08.457
Give me three packs today, honey.

26:18.291 --> 26:20.491
Here you go, keep the change.

26:24.657 --> 26:26.326
Are you okay?

26:26.855 --> 26:28.723
I don't know.

26:31.291 --> 26:35.109
You know, Juan Wayne's birthday
is on Saturday.

26:35.189 --> 26:38.776
- Oh, yeah?
- We're gonna have a big fiesta...

26:38.855 --> 26:43.955
...with a bouncy house, <i>piñata,
mariachis,</i> and lots of food.

26:44.624 --> 26:46.491
<i>Mariachis,</i> huh?

26:50.690 --> 26:52.730
Do you want to come?

26:53.524 --> 26:55.544
To the fiesta?

26:55.624 --> 26:57.190
Saturday.

26:58.490 --> 27:01.492
- And where is it?
- It's at my home.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.569
- You know where the school is?
- Yeah.

27:05.649 --> 27:07.909
It's the yellow house
right behind the school.

27:07.989 --> 27:09.822
Oh, yeah.

27:10.457 --> 27:12.312
Well...

27:12.392 --> 27:15.413
...let's keep it on the burner, okay?

27:15.972 --> 27:19.883
- Okay.
- <i>Gracias. Adiós.</i>

27:20.256 --> 27:23.311
<i>And now we're bringing it over to you, Lisa.</i>

27:23.990 --> 27:26.109
<i>What is the answer to the question?</i>

27:26.189 --> 27:31.277
<i>Is it April 16, 1746, the Battle of Culloden?</i>

27:31.357 --> 27:35.344
<i>The answer to that question...
we'll have to wait until tomorrow.</i>

27:35.424 --> 27:38.640
<i>Thank you for joining us
and we'll see you all tomorrow on...</i>

27:38.720 --> 27:40.524
...Make a Guess.

28:42.524 --> 28:44.723
Hey, man, how you doing?

28:47.923 --> 28:49.490
Okay.

28:50.923 --> 28:54.544
Hey, uh, I was just thinking
about something...

28:54.624 --> 28:56.823
...I wanted to share with you, man.

28:59.257 --> 29:01.092
You got a minute?

29:01.674 --> 29:04.964
Yeah. When I was a kid living in Kentucky...

29:05.646 --> 29:08.310
...I had this BB gun.

29:08.390 --> 29:10.424
It didn't shoot straight.

29:12.090 --> 29:16.610
So I was out one day shooting
at things, trees, leaves.

29:18.722 --> 29:23.521
And there was a mockingbird
up in a tree singing his heart out.

29:25.856 --> 29:27.356
And...

29:27.823 --> 29:31.690
I aimed my gun just to scare him away...

29:31.770 --> 29:33.570
...pulled the trigger...

29:35.123 --> 29:37.363
...and the singing stopped.

29:40.924 --> 29:43.798
It was the saddest moment in my whole life.

29:46.857 --> 29:49.749
The silence it cast in the world...

29:51.099 --> 29:52.927
...was devastating.

29:59.823 --> 30:04.245
I haven't thought about
that bird since I was a kid.

30:08.190 --> 30:09.990
I know.

30:12.557 --> 30:14.424
All right.

30:15.823 --> 30:17.622
Thanks, man.

30:54.103 --> 30:56.049
You been watching <i>Deal or no Deal?</i>

30:57.223 --> 30:59.216
Are you kidding, it makes no sense.

30:59.296 --> 31:03.416
Come on, man, you gotta give it
a second chance. It is...

31:05.204 --> 31:07.009
Listen, listen, check it out.

31:07.089 --> 31:10.240
You start with 50 briefcases...

31:10.320 --> 31:12.943
...right, held by 50 hot chicks.

31:13.023 --> 31:16.944
Right? And inside each briefcase, all 50...

31:17.024 --> 31:21.388
...is a number and that number
is how much money you're gonna win...

31:21.468 --> 31:23.377
...if you open that case.

31:23.457 --> 31:26.277
So you choose one case
at the beginning of the game...

31:26.357 --> 31:28.376
...that you're gonna open up
at the end of the game.

31:28.456 --> 31:31.376
And then you systematically
open up all the briefcases...

31:31.456 --> 31:34.111
...and the hot chicks show you
how much money you could have won.

31:34.191 --> 31:37.010
And the whole time,
there's this hidden guy...

31:37.090 --> 31:41.043
...and he's sitting off stage and he's
offering to buy the case that you chose.

31:41.123 --> 31:45.443
So by the end of the game,
you've opened up all the cases except two.

31:45.522 --> 31:48.874
And you have to decide whether to take
the money from the hidden guy...

31:48.954 --> 31:52.877
...the money that's already in your case
or the case that you haven't chosen yet.

31:52.957 --> 31:56.425
But you don't know what's in your case
or the case you haven't chosen...

31:56.504 --> 31:59.156
...until you actually open it.

32:00.589 --> 32:05.844
So a guy picks a case and I've gotta
wait a fucking hour to see what's in it?

32:05.924 --> 32:07.391
Yeah.

32:08.522 --> 32:11.989
It's a convoluted piece of shit.

32:25.423 --> 32:27.894
Lucky, how you doing, buddy?

32:28.690 --> 32:30.810
I haven't a clue, man.

32:31.390 --> 32:34.371
- Someone's in a mood.
- Leave him be. He'll snap out of it.

32:34.451 --> 32:36.109
Right, pal?

32:36.189 --> 32:38.776
- Two more cases?
- Yeah, that'll do.

32:38.856 --> 32:41.675
- If you want, I can...
- Watch me lift stuff?

32:41.755 --> 32:45.024
Can I help it if I have a strong mind,
but a weak back?

32:46.455 --> 32:48.023
Sit.

32:56.256 --> 33:00.209
I know that look.
Used to see it all the time.

33:00.289 --> 33:04.709
You know where? In the mirror,
my reflection staring back at me.

33:04.789 --> 33:08.311
- And then he met Elaine.
- Hey, who's telling the story?

33:08.391 --> 33:10.943
I'm sorry, but it hasn't exactly
been un-told.

33:11.023 --> 33:13.609
I've told this? You've heard this
before from me? When?

33:13.689 --> 33:16.776
All the time, that's when.
I bet he's heard it, too.

33:16.856 --> 33:20.277
- I've told this? You've heard this?
- <i>Ungatz.</i>

33:20.956 --> 33:24.223
Holy shit, that's right! <i>Ungatz.</i>

33:24.303 --> 33:26.985
- Nothing. I was nothing.
- You were a bum.

33:27.065 --> 33:30.043
I was a bum. I had no plans.
I had no ambitions.

33:30.123 --> 33:31.877
- A two-bit hustler.
- That was me.

33:31.957 --> 33:33.876
- And you knew it.
- I did.

33:33.956 --> 33:37.554
I'd look into the mirror
and all I'd see was <i>ungatz.</i>

33:38.057 --> 33:39.924
I hated myself.

33:41.689 --> 33:44.884
- And then what happened?
- You met Elaine.

33:44.964 --> 33:47.943
Jesus, I can't believe it,
you really listen to me.

33:48.023 --> 33:50.028
That's amazing.

33:50.957 --> 33:54.844
Anyway, I met... I met this fantastic woman.

33:54.924 --> 33:59.509
And she met a bum, a deadbeat.
Did she try to change me? No.

33:59.589 --> 34:02.842
Did she expect me to change myself? No.

34:02.922 --> 34:05.829
- She accepted me for who I was.
- Who you are.

34:05.909 --> 34:07.859
Who I am.

34:07.939 --> 34:10.475
I'm still <i>ungatz,</i> nothing.

34:10.554 --> 34:13.641
But I've got everything.

34:13.721 --> 34:16.744
- Isn't that something?
- Something for you.

34:16.824 --> 34:20.996
No, what I'm trying to say is,
if this could happen, you know, to me...

34:21.077 --> 34:22.710
...then it could happen to anyone.

34:22.790 --> 34:24.619
Even you.

34:25.099 --> 34:26.621
Bullshit.

34:40.989 --> 34:43.375
Jesus Christ.

34:43.455 --> 34:48.076
I believe we can just get by with a will
and a medical power of attorney.

34:48.156 --> 34:51.188
Howard, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.

34:52.550 --> 34:53.509
Who's this?

34:53.589 --> 34:57.309
Hey, Lucky. This here
is my attorney Bobby Lawrence.

34:57.388 --> 34:59.495
- Nice to meet you, Lucky.
- Hello.

35:00.355 --> 35:02.981
You know why sharks don't eat attorneys?

35:04.190 --> 35:06.823
- Uh...
- Professional courtesy.

35:08.190 --> 35:11.224
Right, that's an oldie but a goodie.

35:12.816 --> 35:14.976
So did you come here to help find Roosevelt?

35:15.056 --> 35:17.876
No, he's here to help me with my plan.

35:17.956 --> 35:20.676
- What plan?
- End-of-life plan.

35:20.956 --> 35:22.543
Are you dying?

35:22.623 --> 35:25.295
No, he's just preparing for the unexpected.

35:25.375 --> 35:27.623
What's unexpected?

35:28.757 --> 35:32.442
Well, I mean, none of us
make it out of this thing alive.

35:32.522 --> 35:35.849
So, knowing that, it'd be a sin
not to prepare for the well-being...

35:35.929 --> 35:37.788
...of your loved ones.

35:42.156 --> 35:44.443
What loved ones do you have, anyway?

35:44.523 --> 35:49.388
When I go, I want to leave all
my possessions to President Roosevelt.

35:50.173 --> 35:52.781
- Your turtle?
- Well, you know, this might not...

35:52.861 --> 35:57.430
Tortoise! And he's still got
at least 100 years left in him.

35:57.510 --> 36:00.610
- A hundred years?
- Yeah.

36:00.690 --> 36:04.638
- You know, Lucky, you remind me...
- Shut the fuck up!

36:11.289 --> 36:12.790
Okay.

36:21.489 --> 36:23.710
Didn't Roosevelt just run away?

36:24.389 --> 36:28.542
Yeah, but this is for, you know,
when he comes back.

36:29.089 --> 36:32.542
- Is he a homing turtle?
- Tortoise. And no, he's not.

36:32.622 --> 36:36.211
He's gone, Howard, and you're all alone.

36:36.290 --> 36:39.214
We come in alone, and we go out alone.

36:39.293 --> 36:41.276
That's awfully bleak.

36:41.356 --> 36:43.576
It's beautiful.

36:44.255 --> 36:47.943
"Alone" comes from two words, all-one.

36:48.023 --> 36:50.976
- It's in the dictionary.
- I miss him!

36:51.056 --> 36:52.878
It'll be okay, Howie.

36:53.657 --> 36:56.542
A tortoise is an amazing creature, Lucky.

36:56.622 --> 37:00.876
They're as noble as a king,
and as kindhearted as a grandmother.

37:00.956 --> 37:04.243
I miss my friend, his company.

37:04.323 --> 37:05.876
I miss his personality.

37:05.956 --> 37:08.243
He's not missing, Howard. He's just not here.

37:08.323 --> 37:10.675
He's there, wherever the fuck that is.

37:10.755 --> 37:13.043
And if he's not there, then he's nowhere.

37:13.123 --> 37:16.906
- Well, I'm sure he's okay.
- Why don't you go fuck yourself?

37:16.986 --> 37:18.199
Oh!

37:18.279 --> 37:21.371
You don't give a shit about him.
You're just here to suck him dry.

37:21.451 --> 37:25.543
You lamprey, leach, vulture.

37:26.023 --> 37:29.780
Con him out of his last dime,
just to leave everything to a turtle.

37:29.860 --> 37:33.010
Tortoise! He's a tortoise!

37:33.369 --> 37:35.675
You know that saguaro near your yard?

37:35.755 --> 37:38.876
That thing was barely a twig
when Roosevelt was born.

37:38.956 --> 37:43.455
They're contemporaries, you know?
They watched each other grow up.

37:45.089 --> 37:48.676
President Roosevelt was born
in a hole in the desert.

37:48.756 --> 37:52.154
At that time, a little creature
smaller than my thumb.

37:52.889 --> 37:56.010
And something clicked inside
that little Roosevelt brain...

37:56.090 --> 38:00.356
...and he scampered up out
of that hole and faced the world.

38:01.689 --> 38:04.709
You all think of a tortoise
as something slow.

38:04.789 --> 38:08.077
But I think about the burden
he has to carry on his back.

38:08.856 --> 38:11.009
Yeah, it's for protection.

38:11.089 --> 38:14.511
But ultimately, it's the coffin
he's gonna get buried in...

38:15.390 --> 38:18.657
...and he has to drag that thing
around his entire life?

38:19.690 --> 38:21.895
Go ahead and laugh...

38:21.975 --> 38:23.829
...but he affected me.

38:24.373 --> 38:27.635
You know what I'm saying? He affected me.

38:28.622 --> 38:31.073
There are some things in this universe,
ladies and gentlemen...

38:31.152 --> 38:35.356
...that are bigger than all of us.
And a tortoise is one of 'em!

38:48.789 --> 38:51.188
You asshole.

38:52.989 --> 38:55.175
I want to teach you a lesson.

38:55.855 --> 38:58.309
Lucky! No fighting in my bar, goddammit!

38:58.389 --> 39:01.442
- Then we'll take it outside.
- Seriously, Lucky?

39:01.522 --> 39:04.916
You know, Mr... Mr. Lucky, I...

39:04.996 --> 39:07.555
- ...I don't think...
- You don't think I can take you?

39:08.490 --> 39:11.343
I fought the fucking Japs!
You don't think I can take you?

39:11.423 --> 39:15.222
No. I don't think it's a good idea for you.

39:15.924 --> 39:19.876
Outside. Five minutes. Fisticuffs.

39:19.956 --> 39:22.623
- Lucky...
- Five minutes!

39:24.655 --> 39:26.155
Lucky?

39:27.239 --> 39:28.832
Lucky!

39:34.723 --> 39:36.142
Is he coming out?

39:36.222 --> 39:38.847
Are you kidding? He doesn't wanna fight you.

39:38.927 --> 39:43.092
- I wouldn't want to fight me, either, pal.
- Easy, Lash LaRue.

39:43.172 --> 39:44.764
Let him live this time, okay?

39:44.844 --> 39:48.088
Forty years ago, I wouldn't have
given him a fuckin' option.

39:48.168 --> 39:51.222
Forty years ago, he'd have been in diapers.

39:53.222 --> 39:55.839
Forget about him! Okay?

39:57.355 --> 39:58.922
Okay.

40:11.189 --> 40:12.936
Where you going?

40:19.155 --> 40:20.957
Go home, Lucky.

40:36.089 --> 40:37.670
Paulie?

45:27.255 --> 45:29.122
Hey, there!

45:30.189 --> 45:31.988
How ya' doing?

45:32.688 --> 45:34.353
How did you get here?

45:34.822 --> 45:37.998
- I... drove?
- How did you know where I live?

45:38.078 --> 45:40.673
- Everybody knows where you live.
- They do?

45:40.752 --> 45:43.788
This is a tiny town.
Don't you know where I live?

45:45.489 --> 45:47.443
Yeah, over by the church?

45:47.523 --> 45:48.823
There you go.

45:50.189 --> 45:52.644
So, what do you want?

45:53.223 --> 45:56.405
Well, I was worried about you so I thought
I'd come by and check on you.

45:58.655 --> 46:00.529
You're welcome.

46:00.609 --> 46:02.861
Nice outfit there, cowboy.

46:07.589 --> 46:09.589
Thanks for coming by.

46:23.623 --> 46:27.243
Jesus Christ. How'd you get in here?
I thought you'd left.

46:27.323 --> 46:30.809
I'm sorry, I knocked, the door was unlocked.

46:31.289 --> 46:33.322
You scared me to death.

46:36.789 --> 46:39.040
You were such a cute, little boy.

46:42.246 --> 46:45.355
And such a handsome young man in uniform.

46:48.555 --> 46:51.845
This photo at the beach, are these your kids?

46:52.355 --> 46:53.922
No.

46:55.423 --> 46:57.804
- Were you ever married?
- No.

46:59.193 --> 47:00.799
Were you?

47:02.055 --> 47:03.625
No.

47:06.323 --> 47:10.392
- You got somewhere to be, sailor?
- Uh... no.

47:13.655 --> 47:15.489
Do you like game shows?

47:18.189 --> 47:19.893
Do you smoke grass?

47:35.256 --> 47:37.575
This isn't a game show.

47:37.655 --> 47:39.455
It's ended.

47:51.721 --> 47:55.877
This... he is amazing. Who is this?

47:55.957 --> 47:58.042
Liberace. Didn't you ever hear of him?

47:58.122 --> 48:01.171
Yes, I've heard of him.

48:01.251 --> 48:03.050
He's wonderful.

48:03.655 --> 48:05.943
I feel like such an asshole.

48:06.572 --> 48:08.805
When this guy first came on the scene...

48:09.755 --> 48:12.988
...I wrote him off as just another
extravagant fruit.

48:14.072 --> 48:17.212
If you stop and listen to him,
you'll see he's brilliant!

48:17.621 --> 48:21.282
And I don't know how the hell he plays
with all those rings on his fingers...

48:21.362 --> 48:23.343
...that's even more impressive.

48:24.722 --> 48:26.569
Look at him.

48:28.156 --> 48:33.222
I don't know why I ever gave a shit about
who he was screwing in the first place.

48:34.522 --> 48:36.986
If he was getting laid, more power to him.

48:41.357 --> 48:43.989
Hmm, I can hardly get it up anymore.

48:47.554 --> 48:49.992
<i>I hope I didn't leave anybody out.</i>

48:50.989 --> 48:53.975
<i>Oh, we did leave out somebody.
All you kids...</i>

48:54.055 --> 48:57.363
Oh, shit, I gotta go. I'm late.
I gotta get back to the diner.

48:57.443 --> 48:59.456
Joe is going to kill me.

49:01.956 --> 49:03.688
All right.

49:12.754 --> 49:14.590
<i>Bunch of liars.</i>

49:17.089 --> 49:19.199
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

49:19.279 --> 49:20.808
Bye.

49:21.288 --> 49:23.342
- Hey.
- Yeah?

49:24.188 --> 49:26.444
Can I tell you a secret?

49:26.923 --> 49:28.522
Absolutely.

49:29.888 --> 49:32.688
You won't tell anyone?

49:40.323 --> 49:42.155
I'm scared.

49:47.489 --> 49:49.322
I know.

49:51.722 --> 49:53.522
I know.

50:24.488 --> 50:27.175
Did you ever think about
before you were born?

50:28.555 --> 50:30.842
No, never did.

50:31.466 --> 50:33.321
What are you talking about?

50:34.489 --> 50:36.323
New beginning.

50:38.655 --> 50:42.291
Is that... in the crossword today?

50:42.722 --> 50:44.217
No.

50:45.347 --> 50:49.050
I was just thinking about something that
happened to me when I was about...

50:49.130 --> 50:51.555
...12 or 13 years old.

50:52.323 --> 50:54.588
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

50:56.222 --> 50:58.908
I was at my Aunt Beulah's house, alone.

50:58.988 --> 51:00.821
I don't remember why.

51:02.521 --> 51:06.576
And only once, I got this anxiety attack.

51:06.656 --> 51:10.708
I panicked and I was scared to death.
I started thinking there's nothing out there.

51:10.788 --> 51:13.222
It's all black, there's nothing.

51:14.855 --> 51:18.295
And I was... I was scared shitless, man.

51:19.589 --> 51:21.242
13?

51:21.322 --> 51:22.821
Yeah.

51:26.589 --> 51:28.421
What happened?

51:29.555 --> 51:33.180
I don't know, my aunt came back
and that was the end of it.

51:37.555 --> 51:41.276
- Hey, Bob, how we doing?
- Little bit worse, I'd be perfect.

51:41.355 --> 51:43.188
Sit anywhere you like.

51:52.022 --> 51:55.674
Hey, you know what, Joe?
I'll just take a coffee to go.

51:55.754 --> 51:58.676
Oh, okay. Well, I got a pot brewing.

51:58.756 --> 52:00.555
It'll be a minute.

52:01.388 --> 52:03.188
All right.

52:08.622 --> 52:10.191
Morning.

52:11.185 --> 52:12.769
Hi.

52:14.189 --> 52:15.755
Howdy.

52:22.673 --> 52:25.788
So, no, uh... no sign of The President yet.

52:26.522 --> 52:29.147
I hope he turns up soon,
for Howard's sake. The two of them...

52:29.227 --> 52:31.592
- ...are like heterosexual partners.
- Only one thing worse...

52:31.672 --> 52:33.871
...than awkward silence...

52:34.554 --> 52:36.358
...small talk.

52:40.956 --> 52:42.823
Okay, I hear you.

52:58.254 --> 53:00.056
So you doing okay?

53:01.955 --> 53:03.541
Fragile.

53:03.621 --> 53:05.188
Oh.

53:06.989 --> 53:08.076
Why is that?

53:09.654 --> 53:11.676
I fell down.

53:11.756 --> 53:15.008
Ooh, yeah, yeah, that's... that's bad.

53:15.088 --> 53:17.517
Yup. It rung my bell.

53:21.588 --> 53:23.674
A couple years ago...

53:23.754 --> 53:27.241
...I was heading to my daughter's
school to pick her up.

53:27.321 --> 53:31.185
And as I'm turning around the corner,
you know, going to the parking lot...

53:31.264 --> 53:33.308
...there's a garbage truck that...

53:33.388 --> 53:36.078
...I mean, just barely missed me.

53:36.588 --> 53:40.570
There was no more room between my car
and that truck than between me and this tie.

53:41.022 --> 53:42.857
A half a second...

53:43.738 --> 53:46.380
...a half a second made all the difference.

53:48.389 --> 53:52.864
Two minutes later, my daughter hops into
the car as if nothing's happened, and...

53:54.322 --> 53:56.388
...I guess nothing has.

53:57.455 --> 53:59.288
But, uh...

54:03.855 --> 54:05.863
...it really shook me to the core.

54:09.023 --> 54:13.428
Yeah, I got hair standing up
on my arms just thinking about it.

54:15.088 --> 54:18.409
- Here we go, Bob.
- Oh, thank you.

54:18.489 --> 54:20.375
Gratis, counselor.

54:20.855 --> 54:22.688
Thanks, Joe.

54:23.755 --> 54:25.548
Do you mind if I sit down?

54:27.022 --> 54:28.685
Well, sit down.

54:31.422 --> 54:33.605
Do you have any kids, Lucky?

54:34.722 --> 54:37.787
None that I'm totally sure of, no.

54:38.589 --> 54:41.309
- You married?
- Never been married.

54:41.389 --> 54:43.254
Ever in love?

54:44.188 --> 54:46.009
Yeah, I guess so.

54:46.089 --> 54:48.462
Ah, so it goes, huh?

54:54.122 --> 54:56.195
Well, "The future's not ours to see."

54:57.654 --> 54:59.875
Hell, I've made a whole career out of that.

55:00.654 --> 55:04.209
Wills and trusts, you know, it's about
planning for things that you can't foresee.

55:04.289 --> 55:07.809
Just because you can't see 'em,
doesn't mean they're not gonna happen.

55:07.889 --> 55:11.833
- It is written.
- Mm-hm, somewhere.

55:14.288 --> 55:17.341
You know, I came home
with my daughter that day...

55:17.421 --> 55:19.626
...and I sat down, I made a will.

55:19.856 --> 55:23.662
I wrote end-of-life directives,
I upped my life insurance.

55:24.121 --> 55:26.387
I paid up front for my cremation.

55:27.023 --> 55:29.638
So now, if something happens to me...

55:34.756 --> 55:37.076
...when something happens to me...

55:38.055 --> 55:43.139
...my family doesn't have to worry
about the bureaucracy of death.

55:43.821 --> 55:45.654
You know?

55:46.088 --> 55:48.108
They just call one number...

55:48.988 --> 55:50.784
...and my body's gone
by the end of the day...

55:50.864 --> 55:54.679
...and they don't have to worry about
anything for the rest of their life.

55:54.989 --> 55:58.909
Well, this doesn't change
anything for you, this scenario.

55:58.989 --> 56:02.655
- Why not?
- You're still dead.

57:05.121 --> 57:08.987
How are you doin'?
Hey, how you doing, sweetheart?

57:14.922 --> 57:16.862
Hey, Lucky.

57:17.621 --> 57:20.075
- What's her name?
- Fiona.

57:20.555 --> 57:24.175
Hey, Fiona, you're a fine cut of a dog.

57:24.855 --> 57:26.607
- Yeah.
- Do you have any pets?

57:26.687 --> 57:29.172
- No.
- You ever think about adopting one?

57:29.252 --> 57:30.458
No.

57:30.538 --> 57:33.175
I got plenty inside who need a forever home.

57:33.255 --> 57:35.341
A what? What's a forever home?

57:35.421 --> 57:39.202
That's when someone adopts an animal and
then they have a permanent place to live.

57:40.688 --> 57:42.338
Nothing is permanent.

57:43.522 --> 57:45.721
Come inside, I'll show you around.

57:52.654 --> 57:54.768
It's like the wild kingdom in here.

57:55.187 --> 57:56.836
Aren't they beautiful?

57:56.916 --> 57:59.855
Yeah, and loud.

58:05.234 --> 58:09.207
- Do you have any mockingbirds?
- No, but I can order you one.

58:09.287 --> 58:11.120
No, thanks.

58:18.489 --> 58:22.108
- Are these tortoises?
- No, they're baby turtles.

58:23.187 --> 58:25.641
My friend Howard's tortoise ran away.

58:25.721 --> 58:28.342
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

58:28.875 --> 58:31.174
He said they could live to be 100 years.

58:31.254 --> 58:34.275
Oh, absolutely. In some cases,
I've heard of 200 years.

58:34.355 --> 58:36.008
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

58:36.088 --> 58:37.655
Wow.

58:41.856 --> 58:44.305
- And what are these?
- Crickets.

58:45.489 --> 58:47.374
Can you adopt these, as well?

58:47.454 --> 58:50.508
No. People buy them to feed their reptiles.

58:50.588 --> 58:52.087
Oh.

01:00:42.087 --> 01:00:44.955
Good morning, darling. Anywhere you like.

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:01.117
Marines, huh?

01:01:01.847 --> 01:01:03.696
Yes, sir.

01:01:04.522 --> 01:01:07.192
- You?
- Navy.

01:01:09.021 --> 01:01:11.993
Okay, okay. You guys are great.

01:01:12.554 --> 01:01:14.937
You always gave us a lift to the fight.

01:01:17.054 --> 01:01:20.608
I read somewhere where the Marines
didn't have the mental capacity...

01:01:20.688 --> 01:01:23.588
...to understand
the inner workings of a ship.

01:01:25.521 --> 01:01:27.488
World War II, huh?

01:01:28.088 --> 01:01:30.976
- Pacific.
- Yeah, same here.

01:01:31.546 --> 01:01:33.853
Did you ever get around the Philippines?

01:01:35.255 --> 01:01:39.242
Yeah, I spent a couple years
in that slice of heaven.

01:01:39.322 --> 01:01:42.871
Yeah, me, too, but I never got off the boat.

01:01:42.951 --> 01:01:44.708
Consider yourself lucky.

01:01:46.089 --> 01:01:48.275
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

01:01:48.355 --> 01:01:50.842
- Yes, please, black.
- Mm-hm.

01:01:51.911 --> 01:01:55.808
- A piece of that apple pie?
- Absolutely. You want that warmed up?

01:01:55.888 --> 01:01:56.975
- No.
- All right.

01:01:57.055 --> 01:01:58.921
Thank you, though.

01:02:03.987 --> 01:02:07.920
Well, uh, mind if I come over and join you?

01:02:08.804 --> 01:02:11.438
No. Come on over here.

01:02:19.521 --> 01:02:21.108
Fred Sparks.

01:02:21.188 --> 01:02:22.988
They call me Lucky.

01:02:23.854 --> 01:02:28.922
I was a cook. On paper, that's supposed
to be the easiest job in the Navy.

01:02:29.002 --> 01:02:32.972
- That's why they called me Lucky.
- What were you riding in?

01:02:33.052 --> 01:02:34.655
L-S-T.

01:02:34.734 --> 01:02:38.583
L-S-T? Landing Ship Tank, right?

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:41.943
We called it a large, slow target.

01:02:43.122 --> 01:02:46.341
We were hauling ammunition
for the big battleships.

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:49.422
More like riding a stick of dynamite.

01:02:50.655 --> 01:02:54.008
You ever get a ship shot out
from underneath you?

01:02:54.088 --> 01:02:55.942
Almost once.

01:02:56.721 --> 01:02:59.242
Every day in the evening glare...

01:02:59.322 --> 01:03:02.909
...the suicide planes
came in low over the water...

01:03:03.389 --> 01:03:06.476
...with the sun behind them,
to hit our ships.

01:03:07.155 --> 01:03:10.907
So one day, this suicide plane was coming...

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:14.009
...right towards our ammunition ship.

01:03:14.589 --> 01:03:17.212
And all at once...

01:03:17.292 --> 01:03:19.440
...about 100 yards away...

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.787
...it went up into the air
and slid back down into the water.

01:03:23.921 --> 01:03:26.474
Some of our small arms fire
had hit the pilot.

01:03:26.554 --> 01:03:29.787
- Lucky shot.
- Not for the pilot.

01:03:31.288 --> 01:03:34.288
Did you go straight to
the Philippines from boot camp?

01:03:35.122 --> 01:03:38.308
No, we stopped in Tarawa
and Okinawa on the way...

01:03:38.388 --> 01:03:40.272
...just to show them what <i>fer.</i>

01:03:40.352 --> 01:03:43.181
Tarawa, Jesus Christ.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.208
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you, dear.

01:03:47.288 --> 01:03:49.921
- You're welcome.
- Thank you very much.

01:03:53.188 --> 01:03:56.783
I still think about those people
on the islands, hiding away in caves...

01:03:56.863 --> 01:03:58.753
...afraid of us.

01:03:59.289 --> 01:04:04.095
The Japs said that we were going
to rape and kill them all.

01:04:07.022 --> 01:04:08.860
So, we secured the beach...

01:04:10.421 --> 01:04:14.820
...and the locals who survived
that goddamn fire fight...

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:20.267
...start throwing their children off
the cliffs, and then following them.

01:04:21.688 --> 01:04:25.930
I guess they thought suicide
was better than facing us.

01:04:27.321 --> 01:04:30.777
I remember this little girl,
couldn't have been more than seven...

01:04:30.857 --> 01:04:32.656
...in rags.

01:04:34.855 --> 01:04:38.014
I don't know, she saw us coming,
I guess, and right out of nowhere...

01:04:38.094 --> 01:04:40.342
...out of a hole or wherever it was...

01:04:41.321 --> 01:04:43.541
...and she had this...

01:04:43.621 --> 01:04:48.243
...God, this beautiful smile on her face.

01:04:49.222 --> 01:04:52.475
And it wasn't a facade, it was
coming from somewhere inside...

01:04:52.554 --> 01:04:55.441
...from the center of herself.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:58.044
Good Lord, in that shit hole...

01:04:58.124 --> 01:05:00.584
...something like that really stands out.

01:05:01.988 --> 01:05:05.199
It stopped us in our track. Here we were...

01:05:05.279 --> 01:05:08.899
...all covered with shit,
pieces of people everywhere...

01:05:08.979 --> 01:05:13.209
...and I couldn't see a tree left.
And she's grinning from ear to ear.

01:05:14.887 --> 01:05:17.475
So I said to my corpsman, I said...

01:05:17.554 --> 01:05:20.388
"...Look at this, we got somebody
who's happy to see us."

01:05:21.421 --> 01:05:25.242
And he said, "She's not happy
to see you. She's a Buddhist.

01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:30.200
She thinks she's gonna be killed,
and she's smiling at her fate."

01:05:33.419 --> 01:05:38.141
When I think about that little girl's
beautiful face, and that smile...

01:05:38.221 --> 01:05:40.740
...in the midst of all that horror...

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.921
...and how she summoned...

01:05:45.455 --> 01:05:46.989
...joy.

01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:54.469
They don't make a medal
for that kind of bravery.

01:07:37.122 --> 01:07:41.201
Hi, Lucky. I brought you some flan.
I made it myself.

01:07:41.281 --> 01:07:45.777
- Oh, thank you.
- And this is my mother, Victoria.

01:07:45.857 --> 01:07:48.204
She speaks a little English.

01:07:48.644 --> 01:07:50.204
Lucky.

01:07:50.284 --> 01:07:52.593
- <i>Hola.</i>
- Nice to meet you, darling.

01:07:52.673 --> 01:07:56.121
- <i>Mucho gusto.</i>
- <i>Bueno,</i> I'll be right back, okay?

01:07:58.022 --> 01:07:59.943
Now, um...

01:08:00.023 --> 01:08:04.007
...what does the name Victoria
mean in English?

01:08:04.087 --> 01:08:07.380
- Victory.
- Victory, ah, Che Guevara said...

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:12.175
<i>"...Hasta la victoria siempre."</i>

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:13.627
You speak Spanish?

01:08:13.707 --> 01:08:15.436
Very little.

01:08:15.516 --> 01:08:18.246
My pronunciation is good.

01:08:18.325 --> 01:08:21.885
But my conversation is very limited.

01:08:21.975 --> 01:08:25.270
But this is fantastic.
Your pronunciation is perfect.

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:27.448
It sounds so natural.

01:08:27.529 --> 01:08:29.403
My daughter always speaks highly of you...

01:08:29.483 --> 01:08:32.533
...and she says
you are keen on Mariachi music.

01:08:39.187 --> 01:08:41.020
Excuse me.

01:10:22.353 --> 01:10:25.153
<i>Este amor apasionado</i>

01:10:25.232 --> 01:10:27.431
<i>Anda todo alborotado</i>

01:10:27.511 --> 01:10:30.767
<i>Por volver</i>

01:10:32.487 --> 01:10:37.300
<i>Voy camino a la locura
y aunque todo me tortura</i>

01:10:37.919 --> 01:10:41.476
<i>Sé querer</i>

01:10:42.045 --> 01:10:46.232
<i>Nos dejamos hace tiempo
pero me llegó el momento</i>

01:10:46.312 --> 01:10:49.341
<i>De perder</i>

01:10:52.893 --> 01:10:55.512
<i>Tú tenías mucha razón</i>

01:10:55.592 --> 01:10:59.224
<i>Y le hago caso al corazón</i>

01:11:00.094 --> 01:11:03.961
<i>Y me muero por volver</i>

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:09.473
<i>Y volver, volver</i>

01:11:09.553 --> 01:11:12.572
<i>Volver</i>

01:11:15.639 --> 01:11:19.425
<i>A tus brazos otra vez</i>

01:11:21.448 --> 01:11:24.234
<i>Llegaré hasta donde estés</i>

01:11:24.314 --> 01:11:28.502
<i>Yo sé perder, yo sé perder, quiero volver</i>

01:11:28.582 --> 01:11:32.071
<i>Volver, volver</i>

01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:49.042
<i>Nos dejamos hace tiempo</i>

01:11:49.121 --> 01:11:52.406
<i>Pero me llegó el momento</i>

01:11:52.486 --> 01:11:55.729
<i>De perder</i>

01:11:58.754 --> 01:12:01.252
<i>Tú tenías mucha razón</i>

01:12:01.332 --> 01:12:04.336
<i>Y le hago caso al corazón</i>

01:12:05.569 --> 01:12:09.575
<i>Y me muero por volver</i>

01:12:12.844 --> 01:12:15.739
<i>Y volver, volver</i>

01:12:15.819 --> 01:12:18.830
<i>Volver</i>

01:12:21.828 --> 01:12:25.397
<i>A tus brazos otra vez</i>

01:12:27.504 --> 01:12:30.332
<i>Llegaré hasta donde estés</i>

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:34.512
<i>Yo sé perder, yo sé perder, quiero volver</i>

01:12:34.592 --> 01:12:38.163
<i>Volver, volver</i>

01:12:58.154 --> 01:12:59.331
Lucky!

01:12:59.411 --> 01:13:01.952
One of you will betray me.

01:13:02.031 --> 01:13:05.014
Bullshit. We'll all betray you.

01:13:06.921 --> 01:13:09.507
You look peppy. Where have you been?

01:13:09.587 --> 01:13:13.040
Uh, to a fiesta. Did you ever have flan?

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.036
- No.
- I love it.

01:13:15.116 --> 01:13:17.953
It has an unusual consistency.

01:13:18.821 --> 01:13:22.461
Howie, you find that reptile of yours yet?

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.720
No, but thank you for asking.

01:13:26.654 --> 01:13:28.908
It's okay, I've let it go.

01:13:29.787 --> 01:13:33.841
I kept thinking about how much time
he spent planning his escape.

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:38.020
And how much care he took
in making sure I couldn't find him.

01:13:39.054 --> 01:13:41.842
And then I started to realize
that he wasn't leaving me.

01:13:41.922 --> 01:13:46.008
He was just going off someplace else to
do something he thought was important.

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:50.124
I even felt guilty for standing
in his way for so long.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.787
So I stopped looking for him.

01:13:55.321 --> 01:13:58.013
If it's meant to be, I'll see him again.

01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:02.486
He knows where I am,
and I'm leaving the gate open.

01:14:06.653 --> 01:14:08.520
To Roosevelt!

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:21.241
Hey! What, the rules don't apply to you?

01:14:21.321 --> 01:14:23.373
Since when did you think
you could smoke in here?

01:14:23.453 --> 01:14:25.243
Well, you could in '68.

01:14:25.323 --> 01:14:28.180
Well, it ain't '68 anymore, sweetheart.

01:14:34.954 --> 01:14:37.254
One of these days,
I'm just going to light up.

01:14:46.454 --> 01:14:49.130
My place, my rules.

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:51.674
Ownership is a fallacy.

01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:54.173
Why can't you just live by the rules?

01:14:54.253 --> 01:14:57.707
Authority is arbitrary and subjective.

01:14:57.787 --> 01:15:02.486
This is the same kind of attitude
that got you 86-ed from Eve's.

01:15:03.887 --> 01:15:06.034
- What do you know of it?
- I know you lit up.

01:15:06.114 --> 01:15:07.808
That's what you think happened.

01:15:07.888 --> 01:15:10.168
If you didn't light up,
why did they kick you out?

01:15:10.248 --> 01:15:12.707
They didn't kick me out, I walked out.

01:15:12.787 --> 01:15:15.738
- That's a good story.
- I like that story.

01:15:15.818 --> 01:15:18.345
- It's not a story.
- Then what is it?

01:15:18.425 --> 01:15:22.374
- It's the truth.
- The truth is, you lit up!

01:15:22.454 --> 01:15:26.674
It's not about the cigarettes,
it's about what I know happened...

01:15:26.754 --> 01:15:29.747
- ...and what you think happened.
- I wish I had been there.

01:15:29.827 --> 01:15:32.107
You could have been there
and still have missed it.

01:15:32.187 --> 01:15:35.774
You broke the rules.
You got busted and banned.

01:15:35.854 --> 01:15:39.540
- That's the truth.
- How about if we all agree to disagree?

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:43.620
No. I know the truth and the truth matters!

01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:47.620
It's a thing. Right?

01:15:49.086 --> 01:15:52.374
Yes, truth is a thing.

01:15:52.454 --> 01:15:56.874
It's the truth of who we are and what we do.

01:15:57.654 --> 01:16:01.140
And you have to face that, and accept it.

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:05.420
Because the truth of the universe is waiting.

01:16:09.121 --> 01:16:11.904
- I'm lost.
- The truth of what is...

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:14.108
...for all of us.

01:16:14.188 --> 01:16:15.355
Which is?

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:22.254
That it's all going to go away.

01:16:23.822 --> 01:16:28.313
You, you, you, you, me,
this cigarette, everything...

01:16:29.754 --> 01:16:32.788
...into blackness, the void.

01:16:34.986 --> 01:16:37.186
And nobody's in charge.

01:16:38.353 --> 01:16:40.170
And you're left with...

01:16:42.153 --> 01:16:44.186
<i>...ungatz.</i>

01:16:46.353 --> 01:16:48.173
<i>Ungatz.</i>

01:16:48.253 --> 01:16:51.090
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

01:16:52.389 --> 01:16:54.880
That's... that's all there is.

01:16:58.288 --> 01:17:01.721
- And what do you do with that?
- What do we do with that?

01:17:10.954 --> 01:17:12.820
You smile.
