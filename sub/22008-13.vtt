WEBVTT

00:04.463 --> 00:06.876
Yeah, so you've got everything?
Wonderful.

00:07.049 --> 00:10.668
Thank you so much for coming,
and drive carefully. All right?

00:10.844 --> 00:13.302
- We look forward to having you again.
- Bye, Zeke.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.060
Zeke. Perfect timing.

00:24.233 --> 00:27.943
Tim was just telling us
how Sophia picked him up at a bar.

00:28.111 --> 00:32.276
- She used to be the shyest girl in school.
- She wasn't shy with me.

00:32.448 --> 00:34.816
- Can we please change the subject?
- Sure.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.110
I wanna hear about
what Tim does for a living.

00:37.287 --> 00:40.621
- I told you. I make security products.
- Handguns.

00:40.791 --> 00:44.330
You make the cheapest handguns
on the market today.

00:44.503 --> 00:48.247
You flood poor cities with guns that have
no value to anyone but criminals.

00:48.423 --> 00:52.258
- Your sales drive up homicide rates.
- You profit off misery.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.460
That's blood money, Tim.

00:54.638 --> 00:59.349
What the hell is this?
It isn't against the law to sell guns.

00:59.518 --> 01:03.262
It isn't. The law protects gunmakers
like you from being sued.

01:03.438 --> 01:07.022
- You brought me here to insult me?
- We all brought you here.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.730
Not to insult you, to punish you.

01:49.151 --> 01:52.394
Keen, I have your husband's
personal effects.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.450
- How'd you do it?
- Excuse me?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.282
I know you killed Navarro.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.289
And I know you left that bloody rag
behind in his apartment.

02:04.458 --> 02:08.077
I don't know how you broke
into Evidence lockup and stole it.

02:08.252 --> 02:10.495
Someone broke
into the evidence lockup?

02:12.591 --> 02:15.004
I'm here to deliver Tom's things
in person.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.089
- Step back.
- All you do is lie.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.753
Be careful, detective.

02:18.930 --> 02:22.344
No matter what you believe,
you're still talking to a federal agent.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.601
We'll see how cool you are
when I come to arrest you.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.933
Because that day is coming.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.683
Thank you for bringing Tom's things.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.915
- Cooper here.
- I need your help.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.702
Outside the upstate New York town
of Harrington...

03:32.879 --> 03:36.338
...locals have long told ghost stories
about these abandoned fields...

03:36.508 --> 03:38.420
...and the walking dead who haunt them.

03:38.593 --> 03:42.428
Last night, for a few teens,
those stories became all too real.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.839
<i>Alex, can you tell us what happened?</i>

03:45.016 --> 03:47.759
<i>We hopped the fence and walked
into the fields on a dare.</i>

03:47.936 --> 03:49.768
<i>That's when I saw the new grave.</i>

03:49.938 --> 03:52.271
<i>So far, authorities have
uncovered one dead body...</i>

03:52.441 --> 03:54.273
<i>...and are continuing to investigate.</i>

03:54.443 --> 03:57.777
I have to say, I would've done the same
when I was a kid.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.187
It's a ghost story.

03:59.364 --> 04:04.610
Creepy woods, rumors of corpses
walking around in the dead of night.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.402
Is that your dog...

04:06.580 --> 04:08.242
...or a customer's?

04:08.415 --> 04:11.032
What a dear. Yes.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.292
You're a good girl. All right.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.374
Off you go.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.625
A few days ago, Tim Gorman...

04:20.802 --> 04:23.340
...the owner of Ballistic-Nine...

04:23.513 --> 04:26.677
...a controversial
gun-manufacturing company...

04:26.850 --> 04:29.968
...based in Reading, Pennsylvania,
disappeared.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.102
He's in the shallow grave?

04:32.272 --> 04:35.140
The businessman who makes guns
a fifth the price of an iPhone?

04:35.317 --> 04:36.933
Murdered, I believe...

04:37.110 --> 04:41.400
...by a provocative group known
as the Invisible Hand.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.530
I saw the news. They found Gorman.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.408
Not just Gorman.
I wanna conference in Sophia.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.740
So they're vigilantes?
Going after criminals...

04:48.914 --> 04:52.908
- ...the legal system failed to convict.
- The criminals here aren't criminals at all.

04:53.084 --> 04:56.293
That's the point.
The Invisible Hand chooses targets...

04:56.463 --> 05:00.082
...who aren't actually committing crimes
under existing law.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.966
Like Tim Gorman.
Everything he did was legal.

05:03.136 --> 05:07.801
Yes, but morally reprehensible
in the eyes of the Hand.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.303
"Eyes of the Hand."

05:10.477 --> 05:12.810
What an odd turn of phrase.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.595
- I'm on.
- Mommy, Mommy.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.685
Mommy has to take this call.

05:16.858 --> 05:19.942
- We don't have time for this.
<i>- Sorry, I wasn't expecting the call.</i>

05:20.111 --> 05:22.273
Can we just stay focused?
We all saw the news.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.439
<i>Police are digging up the site.</i>

05:24.616 --> 05:26.448
- We'll be exposed.
- You don't know that.

05:26.618 --> 05:27.904
- Oh, my God.
- Mom?

05:28.078 --> 05:30.240
I agree with Stephen.
We've covered our tracks.

05:30.413 --> 05:33.281
- Nothing leads back to us.
- Let me do some sniffing around.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.541
I can call sources,
see what the police know.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.997
Great. We meet later at Zeke's.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.414
Does Reddington have proof
the Invisible Hand is killing these people?

05:41.591 --> 05:45.551
Gorman's body was found in a grave
in a Superfund site in Brenford.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.509
- He believes others are buried there too.
- "Brenford." Okay.

05:49.683 --> 05:53.302
Their biggest employer was
the Atria Chemical Corporation.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.266
They dumped so many toxins,
the EPA set up the site...

05:56.439 --> 05:59.056
...10 square miles of uninhabitable land.

05:59.234 --> 06:02.602
- The perfect place to dump bodies.
- Navabi, Ressler, reach out...

06:02.779 --> 06:04.816
...to the investigating team.

06:04.990 --> 06:08.779
If that is a mass grave,
I wanna know who the bodies are.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.164
The chemical concentration
in the soil isn't uniform.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.997
Some pockets are highly corrosive,
others are less toxic.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.753
All right, here's your gunmaker.

06:26.094 --> 06:29.132
They planted him where there's
a huge concentration of chemicals.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.719
- How many bodies have you found?
- Six, so far.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.600
The topography makes me think
we'll find more.

06:34.769 --> 06:38.934
Oh, I pulled this down for you.
It's a surveillance camera.

06:39.107 --> 06:42.191
The EPA monitors these sites
to study terrain shifts.

06:42.360 --> 06:46.274
- Where was this installed exactly?
- Facing the one access road in a birch.

06:46.448 --> 06:47.984
It takes one photo a day.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.696
Shows the changes in the topsoil
caused by the toxins.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.407
We need to see the images
as soon as possible.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.116
You got it.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.166
<i>The cops don't know anything yet.</i>

07:00.337 --> 07:04.297
They can't figure out who most of the
bodies are, let alone connect them to us.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.797
Look, everything we do, we do together.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.587
We choose who is deserving
of punishment together.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.634
We execute sentence together.
And we are all equally responsible.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.644
So if you guys wanna stop, we stop.

07:18.813 --> 07:23.854
But I think once you see this,
you'll realize that isn't possible now.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.318
You found her.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.859
She's here. She's back in the country.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.243
But not for long.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.869
She has to die.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.865
Don't forget why we started this.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.999
I say we vote.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.463
Anna Hopkins...

07:50.637 --> 07:53.971
...you will know the Invisible Hand.

08:01.648 --> 08:05.062
- We've discovered nine bodies.
- Any idea how they were killed?

08:05.235 --> 08:07.397
The autopsies suggest
they were buried alive.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.734
Each put in the ground conscious,
aware of what was happening.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.864
I've got four names for you.

08:13.034 --> 08:16.027
Gorman, the gunmaker, you know.
The second body is Ralph Ellis.

08:16.204 --> 08:19.072
Went missing two years ago.
Works for Ace-Gen Pharmaceuticals.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.663
The ones that jacked up cancer prices
so the poor couldn't afford them.

08:22.836 --> 08:26.079
The rest of them were mostly skeletons.
Edward Waybur and David Flynn.

08:26.256 --> 08:29.670
They were the first ones in the ground.
Waybur was a retired judge.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.085
Flynn was a lawyer in Philly.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.594
Excuse me.

08:33.763 --> 08:37.381
We know why the Invisible Hand targeted
the gunmaker and the Big Pharma exec.

08:37.558 --> 08:41.428
What did Waybur and Flynn do
to deserve being killed?

08:41.604 --> 08:44.221
- Anthony Pagliaro?
- He won't leave, Raymond.

08:44.399 --> 08:47.733
He's sorry for the unexpected visit,
but it's a work-related emergency.

08:47.902 --> 08:51.566
He works at a post office. What kind
of emergency could we be talking about?

08:52.198 --> 08:54.110
Bring him in.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.699
I know. Don't even say it.
Unexpected drop-ins, not kosher.

08:58.872 --> 09:03.037
All I can say is, I would never
if it wasn't an absolute...

09:03.209 --> 09:05.201
Emergency, Dembe said.

09:05.378 --> 09:09.372
In my experience, everyone has
their own definition of an emergency.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.883
- Somebody's trying to kill me.
- That fits my definition.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.511
It's my fault. I needed some money.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.717
There's this guy at work.
He has this route.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.679
He told me about this house,
said it was a big drug spot.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.684
So I covered his route for a week.

09:22.854 --> 09:25.141
I found this package
that I figure was loaded...

09:25.315 --> 09:29.901
...with something I could sell.
It's drugs, so maybe they don't report it.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.858
If they do report it, I say, "I have no idea.

09:33.031 --> 09:36.149
With everything I deliver,
it must have went missing."

09:36.326 --> 09:39.865
I'm remembering now why I make
the plans when we do business.

09:40.038 --> 09:43.702
And I was dead-on.
Package was loaded. Cocaine.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.958
So now I'm rich, right? Boom.

09:46.127 --> 09:49.541
Next day, I get a visit
from a walking refrigerator.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.206
Calls himself "Big Willie Wilkins."

09:52.383 --> 09:55.672
Imagine the confidence a man has
to have in his own genitals...

09:55.845 --> 09:58.258
...to take on the nickname
like "Big Willie."

09:58.431 --> 10:01.424
Oh, yeah, he's confident all right.
He's also:

10:01.601 --> 10:04.639
And he's not buying my story
how his shipment went missing.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.600
So I told him it was stolen...

10:06.773 --> 10:09.436
...by another dealer I hear
the guys at work talk about.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.317
Momo, they call him. Momo Marinello.

10:12.487 --> 10:15.150
Does Momo know you're the one
who falsely accused him?

10:15.323 --> 10:19.112
Yeah. I'm his prime suspect.
And he's going to kill me for sure.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.451
What did you need the money for?

10:22.205 --> 10:23.571
I'd rather not say.

10:23.748 --> 10:27.162
- Does it matter?
- It does to me.

10:27.335 --> 10:31.124
I'm dating this girl now, okay?
She's a little out of my league.

10:31.297 --> 10:34.210
So I just thought I could use a little...

10:34.384 --> 10:36.626
You know, a little help in the...

10:38.054 --> 10:39.135
...liposculpture.

10:39.305 --> 10:42.264
I know, it's embarrassing.
I'm not proud of it.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.676
Doesn't mean I deserve two in the head
from Big Willie Wilkins.

10:45.854 --> 10:50.019
Come. Let's take a ride over
and see this Large William...

10:50.191 --> 10:52.183
...and explain the misunderstanding.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.103
- What? No. That's a bad idea.
- Relax.

10:55.280 --> 11:00.617
In a matter like this,
honesty is always the best policy.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.617
Probably.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.074
What's left?
I wanna get back to the hotel.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.865
Your last interview just got here.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.044
You're punctual. I like punctuality.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.924
- Anna Hopkins, nice to meet you.
- Thanks for seeing me.

11:18.094 --> 11:22.008
Take a seat. Let's get started.
Smart of you to do this story now.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.391
Once we announce this new initiative,
we expect to be very busy.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.052
I'm sorry, do you mind if I have a water?

11:29.564 --> 11:32.682
Thanks to Steve Jobs,
new product lines have to be kept secret...

11:32.859 --> 11:35.602
...and then launched like a movie.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.528
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.281
You don't mind if I record this, do you?

11:46.080 --> 11:47.537
I don't know how you got a hit.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.950
That camera takes one photo
every 24 hours of that road.

11:51.127 --> 11:54.370
What are the chances
it would capture a suspicious car?

11:54.547 --> 11:58.791
Right? They're like slim to none.
Which is probably why it didn't happen.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.086
I looked at 730 photos.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.300
No cars in the foreground on the road.

12:04.474 --> 12:07.763
But one photo had something
in the background.

12:07.936 --> 12:10.929
And I enhanced it.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.850
Why visit a contaminated site
without protective gear?

12:16.611 --> 12:18.398
Now, who the hell is that?

12:57.277 --> 12:58.734
"Oleander."

12:58.903 --> 13:01.691
Tom was researching the name
when he was killed.

13:05.535 --> 13:06.571
It's a person.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.615
- You found something.
- I made calls.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.953
Cashed in a few favors from friends
working in counterintelligence.

13:13.126 --> 13:18.087
Oleander was the name of a Russian
operative active during the Cold War.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.669
- A Russian agent?
- Not sure he's still alive.

13:20.842 --> 13:24.677
CIA thought he might be living
in the U.S. under an assumed name.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.463
That was never proven.
No charges were filed.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.848
- Thank you for this.
- Be very careful.

13:30.018 --> 13:34.353
If that man is the operative they call
Oleander, he's extremely dangerous.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.765
He won't appreciate FBI agents
dropping by to ask questions.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.669
Dominic Wilkinson?

14:05.219 --> 14:08.178
- Who's asking?
- Elizabeth Keen, FBI.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.056
I was hoping to ask you
a few questions.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.898
There's something on the nose...

14:24.072 --> 14:26.735
...about a drug operation
in the back of a candy factory.

14:26.908 --> 14:30.322
I can't get Sammy Davis Jr.
out of my head.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.861
Big Willie.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.530
I appreciate you taking the time.

14:34.707 --> 14:39.168
Raymond damn Reddington. I thought
somebody was pulling my chain.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.669
Certainly not me.

14:40.838 --> 14:44.627
Although I admit there's been
a modicum of chain-pulling of late.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.838
I believe you know my associate,
Anthony.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.172
- He's with you?
- He is.

14:48.346 --> 14:49.882
Look, Mr. Wilkins...

14:50.056 --> 14:51.172
Willie.

14:51.349 --> 14:56.140
About the package, the thing is, I know
that I had told you that it was stolen.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.269
But the truth is...

14:59.315 --> 15:02.558
I'm sorry, I'm a little light-headed
right now. Oh, boy.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.978
Oh, for God's sake.
Your package was stolen, Willie...

15:06.155 --> 15:08.021
...but not by Momo Marinello.

15:08.199 --> 15:11.192
Your first instinct was correct.
Anthony took it...

15:11.369 --> 15:15.784
...in an extremely misguided effort
to finance a personal procedure...

15:15.957 --> 15:18.540
...he'd rather not discuss
except amongst friends.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.996
What matters is,
now that you know the truth...

15:21.170 --> 15:23.753
...you can call off
whatever search you're conducting.

15:23.923 --> 15:28.293
Anthony will pay you back in full
with interest. No harm, no foul.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.216
"No harm"?

15:35.268 --> 15:36.554
Oh, Willie.

15:39.397 --> 15:40.854
You certainly work fast.

15:41.023 --> 15:44.061
My guys caught up with Momo
about an hour ago.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.193
This is David Flynn,
the lawyer from Philly.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.902
The other body was Judge Waybur.

15:52.076 --> 15:55.069
Both have a connection to the town
where the bodies were found.

15:55.246 --> 15:58.330
Waybur spent his career
hearing cases in Brenford.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.867
Before Flynn moved to Philadelphia,
he was the general counsel...

16:02.044 --> 16:05.537
...of Atria Corporation, the chemical
company that poisoned Brenford.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.833
Sounds like a good reason
for the Invisible Hand to want them dead.

16:09.010 --> 16:12.048
What about Waybur?
Did Flynn appear in a case before him?

16:12.221 --> 16:15.305
I had the same question.
Flynn appeared before Waybur...

16:15.475 --> 16:18.058
- ...to defend Atria in one case.
- About what?

16:18.227 --> 16:21.720
- I can't say. The records are sealed.
- Sealed by Waybur himself?

16:21.898 --> 16:26.438
Another plaintiff sought to have
the case unsealed almost 15 years ago...

16:26.611 --> 16:28.068
- ...and failed.
- Do we know why?

16:28.237 --> 16:31.196
No. All I have is the name
of the person who tried.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.823
Stephen Altman.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.950
- Look who it is.
- It's our ghost.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.739
- The man in the woods.
- Stephen Altman was raised in Brenford.

16:39.916 --> 16:43.626
<i>His parents died of bone cancer
as a result of Atria's chemical spills.</i>

16:43.794 --> 16:46.787
<i>Stephen was a teenager
when he sued Atria for wrongful death.</i>

16:46.964 --> 16:50.332
His case was dismissed for failure
to meet the burden of proof.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.878
I can't find any record of him
over the last two years. No taxes paid.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.967
No driver's license. No address.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.678
Maybe he moved back.
I know it sounds crazy.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.514
If he's around those woods
without a hazmat suit...

17:01.687 --> 17:04.270
...maybe he's reckless enough
to move back to Brenford.

17:04.440 --> 17:08.935
What brings an FBI agent out to visit
with an old, retired systems analyst?

17:09.111 --> 17:12.104
You're not a retired systems analyst,
Mr. Wilkinson.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.817
Really? Then who am I?

17:13.991 --> 17:17.826
I think you're a former Russian operative,
code-named Oleander.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.953
"Oleander"?

17:21.457 --> 17:23.414
That's why you're here?

17:23.584 --> 17:25.325
Chasing that old ghost story?

17:25.502 --> 17:27.460
You were investigated by the CIA.

17:27.630 --> 17:31.089
Yes. I was investigated by the CIA,
and I was cleared.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.922
The case was put on hold
due to insufficient evidence.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.633
But if the CIA came after you,
they had a reason.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.138
What's this all about?

17:42.311 --> 17:44.769
Be straight with me,
I'll be straight with you.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.563
My husband was killed over a year ago.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.026
I'm trying to understand why.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.740
I'm very sorry for your loss.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.613
I'm not Oleander.

18:03.791 --> 18:07.410
I used to work with Russian Intelligence...

18:07.587 --> 18:10.330
...but I was not an apparatchik,
an agent.

18:10.506 --> 18:14.841
I was an analyst in the civilian sector.
Agricultural production, sugar beets.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.173
There had to be more to it.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.841
After the Cold War, I...

18:22.018 --> 18:26.979
I came to this country to teach analytics.
I was granted asylum and citizenship.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.310
I changed my name. I started over.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.900
I wish I could help you.

18:33.070 --> 18:36.609
I can see that you're a good person, kind.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.318
You have...

18:38.492 --> 18:42.281
Your eyes remind me of someone.

18:44.540 --> 18:47.999
You said you worked
for Russian Intelligence...

18:48.169 --> 18:49.705
...so you knew operatives.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.088
Yes, but not Oleander.

18:54.216 --> 18:57.175
What about Katarina Rostova?

18:59.972 --> 19:02.430
Yes. Katarina.

19:03.392 --> 19:06.305
Yes, I knew Katarina quite well.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.555
Hey, I thought Momo stole from me.

19:09.732 --> 19:12.600
- What else was I supposed to do?
- Didn't have to kill him.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.313
If I don't respond, I look weak.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.355
If I look weak, somebody's gonna
wrap me up in a plastic bag.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.148
Leadership is about more
than showing strength.

19:20.326 --> 19:23.239
It's also about knowing
when to show restraint.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.448
"Restraint"?

19:24.622 --> 19:28.662
You mean like me not putting
a bullet in your man's head for lying?!

19:29.293 --> 19:30.454
Like I said, bad idea.

19:30.628 --> 19:34.542
My associate here is the least
of your concerns right now.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.331
Do you realize what you've done?

19:36.509 --> 19:39.377
Momo's guys are going
to have to retaliate.

19:39.553 --> 19:40.760
Put the gun down.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.508
- Hey, we've got some cars coming up.
- Who is it?

19:46.018 --> 19:48.385
William, you've started a drug war.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.850
Great.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.090
Raymond!

20:26.308 --> 20:27.890
Oh, shoot. Anthony.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.849
Anthony. Dembe.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.520
- I don't wanna die.
- You won't.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.901
We're gonna get you help right now.

20:58.841 --> 21:02.380
- Looks like the end of the world.
- This is where Altman grew up.

21:02.553 --> 21:05.421
The whole town's dead,
no power for miles.

21:06.849 --> 21:10.058
Why is there smoke coming out
of that chimney?

21:13.397 --> 21:14.933
On your right!

21:15.107 --> 21:16.518
Clear.

21:20.488 --> 21:23.652
He must have heard us.
Looks like he took off.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.905
- What is this?
- Surveillance gear. Advanced.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.324
So he's tracking someone.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.034
Clear.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.715
Stephen Altman was tracking someone
or something...

21:49.892 --> 21:53.886
- ...using the gear we found.
- We have to assume it's the next victim.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.931
There. For 22 minutes,
that tracker hasn't moved.

21:57.107 --> 22:00.225
The Braxton Hotel. Maybe that's
where their next target is staying.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.394
Probably. I'm working on it now.

22:02.571 --> 22:07.316
Fortunately, the device they're using is
a three-axis accelerometer on steroids.

22:07.493 --> 22:11.112
In addition to front-to-back
and left-to-right, it tracks up-and-down.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.779
You can determine the altitude.

22:12.957 --> 22:15.540
I think whoever
the Invisible Hand is watching...

22:15.709 --> 22:18.543
...is currently at this point in space...

22:18.712 --> 22:21.295
...282 feet above the ground.

22:21.465 --> 22:24.958
I've been roughing out
a 3D simulation of the Braxton Hotel.

22:25.135 --> 22:28.549
And if I can superimpose it
over the tracking point...

22:29.932 --> 22:32.470
...then that is the 17th floor.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.435
Oh, I know, I know. Isn't he adorable?

22:37.982 --> 22:42.022
Call the hotel, find out
who's staying there. You two, get there.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.569
Her daughter?

22:44.738 --> 22:46.479
Masha? Of course.

22:46.657 --> 22:49.274
That's who you remind me of.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.653
Such a strong resemblance.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.821
I never knew my mother.

22:54.999 --> 22:58.538
Katarina and I, we worked
in the same building for a time.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.749
She was a legend even then.
Everybody wanted to know her.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.083
You were friends?

23:04.133 --> 23:05.544
I saw you with her once.

23:05.718 --> 23:08.836
She had to stop by the office
for something urgent.

23:09.013 --> 23:12.006
And there you were, maybe 3 years old.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.637
Did you know Reddington?

23:17.479 --> 23:19.596
I don't wanna talk about Reddington.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.273
Why not?

23:24.403 --> 23:26.360
I just don't.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.691
Do you think she's dead?

23:33.162 --> 23:34.198
Katarina?

23:34.788 --> 23:39.408
I know they say she committed suicide,
but there was a man, Anton Velov...

23:39.585 --> 23:43.795
...he was a colonel in the Spetsnaz.
He said she might still be alive.

23:44.757 --> 23:48.967
I never heard from Katarina
after she left for America.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.340
What really happened to her...

23:52.431 --> 23:54.844
...I think there are some people...

23:55.017 --> 23:58.010
...who want to keep
that information a secret.

23:59.271 --> 24:03.686
And I think they will do whatever is
necessary even now to keep it that way.

24:03.859 --> 24:07.819
The guest is Anna Hopkins,
executive vice president of Optimize...

24:07.988 --> 24:11.106
...a European company that specializes
in green-energy initiatives.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.445
- Green energy?
- Doesn't that make her a good guy?

24:13.619 --> 24:15.076
<i>Why is she being targeted?</i>

24:15.245 --> 24:18.454
Before Hopkins tried to save the planet,
she polluted it.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.832
She was a senior executive
at Atria Chemical.

24:21.001 --> 24:24.210
Hopkins was in charge of matters
related to the chemical spill.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.963
After Atria shut down,
she accepted a job in London...

24:27.132 --> 24:28.839
...and has been overseas ever since.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.422
<i>It looks like she's in town
to give a speech...</i>

24:31.595 --> 24:33.382
<i>...announcing a new product.</i>

24:33.555 --> 24:35.638
- Yes?
- I got a priority overnight...

24:35.808 --> 24:37.640
...for an Anna Hopkins?

24:37.810 --> 24:41.394
- Thank you. Leave it outside.
- I can't do that. You need to sign.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.395
Hang on a sec.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.813
Hello. Yes.
This is Anna Hopkins in 1712.

24:51.365 --> 24:54.278
There's a courier here
who says he has a delivery.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.317
I'm just confirming you sent him up.

24:57.830 --> 24:58.866
I see.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.790
<i>Braxton Hotel. Security.</i>

25:02.960 --> 25:04.952
This is Agent Navabi with the FBI.

25:05.129 --> 25:07.667
One of your guests is
in imminent danger.

25:07.840 --> 25:11.083
- Anna Hopkins.
<i>- Room 1712. Yeah, we just got a call.</i>

25:11.260 --> 25:14.128
<i>- I'm sending a team up now.</i>
- What's happening?

25:14.304 --> 25:16.216
- Excuse me, sir?
- There's no problem.

25:16.390 --> 25:19.303
- Trying to deliver a package.
- Not without checking in first.

25:19.476 --> 25:20.887
Let's go.

25:26.483 --> 25:27.894
Thank you so much.

25:29.820 --> 25:32.028
Fifteen seconds. Get her up.

25:44.418 --> 25:45.534
Stop! FBI!

26:13.614 --> 26:17.028
She's alive. Roll an ambulance
with backup to our location.

26:17.201 --> 26:19.659
- Hands up.
- Suspects in a maroon van.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.115
Unmarked. No rear plate.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.836
Hello there.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.174
What's going on?

26:36.595 --> 26:41.386
When we bury you, we want you to feel
as powerless as your victims did...

26:41.558 --> 26:44.517
...when you were at Atria
and destroyed our town.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.099
Brenford?

26:48.232 --> 26:50.565
- That's what this is about?
- We know what you did.

26:50.734 --> 26:54.603
One of our neighbors sued you over
a year before everyone else got sick.

26:55.155 --> 26:58.148
You ordered your lawyer
to negotiate a secret settlement.

26:58.325 --> 27:01.409
- Which was legal.
- Your blood money bought their silence.

27:01.578 --> 27:06.073
So you could go on making millions
while we got to watch everyone we love...

27:06.250 --> 27:08.913
...get sick, and suffer, and die.

27:09.086 --> 27:11.999
I felt horrible about what happened.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.379
I left the business.

27:13.549 --> 27:16.883
I'm working in alternative energy,
trying to make amends.

27:17.052 --> 27:20.386
Amends? For killing our parents?

27:20.556 --> 27:21.922
For killing me?

27:22.975 --> 27:24.432
No.

27:25.894 --> 27:29.137
Where were they going?
Hey. Answer the question.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.556
- Because if that woman dies...
- I can't.

27:31.733 --> 27:33.315
We know about the Invisible Hand.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.444
We know you work
with Stephen Altman. It's over.

27:36.613 --> 27:39.481
We know about Tim Gorman,
David Flynn, Judge Edward Waybur.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.822
- You can't protect them...
- You don't understand.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.702
They're not people I'm working with.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.489
They're my best friends.
We grew up together.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.374
Do you care about your friends...

27:50.544 --> 27:52.661
...more than your own children?

27:52.838 --> 27:54.750
We're giving you an opportunity.

27:54.923 --> 27:59.543
Perhaps the only chance you'll get
to see them outside of prison.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.299
It was just supposed to be them.

28:06.476 --> 28:09.059
David Flynn, Judge Waybur...

28:09.229 --> 28:11.016
...and Anna Hopkins.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.601
They did this to us.

28:12.774 --> 28:15.437
They settled that case,
made sure it was sealed.

28:16.653 --> 28:21.990
The law allowed them
to kill all those families in Brenford.

28:22.618 --> 28:25.656
We all agreed we had
to do something, so we did.

28:25.829 --> 28:28.788
We found all of them
except Anna Hopkins.

28:30.083 --> 28:32.120
And after, I knew we should stop.

28:32.294 --> 28:35.458
But Stephen, he said
that there was no going back.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.167
We were killers now.

28:37.341 --> 28:40.755
We owe it to ourselves
and the other victims to keep going.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.885
Where were they taking Hopkins?

28:43.055 --> 28:46.799
Stephen's dying.
He found out almost two years ago.

28:46.975 --> 28:50.764
The same bone cancer
that killed his parents, and mine...

28:50.938 --> 28:54.181
- ...and Zeke's, and Bobby's...
- Where were they going?

28:54.358 --> 28:57.772
Back to that wasteland.

28:57.945 --> 29:00.107
To bury her in the same ground
she destroyed.

29:00.280 --> 29:03.398
To the Superfund site,
the one place they know we'll be looking.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.692
You can try,
but you won't find them in time.

29:05.869 --> 29:09.203
It's 10 square miles
of brush and wilderness.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.035
I can show you where they are.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.872
There's a clearing 40 yards west
of our old high school.

29:15.045 --> 29:17.332
- How do you know that's where?
- Because...

29:18.465 --> 29:20.707
...that's where we dug the grave.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.053
What the hell was that?

29:30.227 --> 29:32.560
- The FBI was waiting for us.
- Take it easy.

29:32.729 --> 29:34.220
We were sitting ducks.

29:34.398 --> 29:36.515
- They knew about Hopkins.
- Yes, yes.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.228
How did they know?

29:38.402 --> 29:41.236
They raided my house,
found all our surveillance.

29:41.405 --> 29:44.364
What? No, Stephen, no.
You should've told us that.

29:44.533 --> 29:47.276
- We would've called it off.
- Exactly why I didn't tell you.

29:47.452 --> 29:50.240
I knew none of you would step up
and finish what we started.

29:50.414 --> 29:52.280
We finally got Anna Hopkins.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.868
Nothing else matters.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.159
Nothing matters to you
because you're dying.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.453
- We have things to live for.
- For now.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.713
Until you get sick.
Don't think you won't.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.839
We have kids and families.

30:03.010 --> 30:05.969
We love you, Stephen,
but you should have told us.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.674
Let us decide for ourselves.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.847
- I'm sorry, Bobby.
- Yeah.

30:14.021 --> 30:17.480
I won't... I won't make it to a hospital.

30:18.692 --> 30:22.151
You finish what we started.

30:36.710 --> 30:37.871
Have a seat.

30:40.297 --> 30:41.663
I'm not asking.

30:46.303 --> 30:48.511
Look, man, why am I here?

30:49.056 --> 30:52.766
I'm not gonna touch your boy Anthony
if that's what you're worried about.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.051
I've got enough problems now.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.390
You're here
because I want information.

30:57.564 --> 31:00.352
Truth be told,
my desire to help Anthony...

31:00.525 --> 31:04.394
...with his little situation
was not entirely altruistic.

31:04.571 --> 31:10.158
I have a project that would benefit
from your experience selling narcotics.

31:11.161 --> 31:12.652
Which is?

31:12.829 --> 31:15.242
I want to go after the Nash syndicate.

31:15.415 --> 31:19.250
Nash? Come on, man.
You want to go up against those guys?

31:19.419 --> 31:23.959
- You're a big enough fish. Why risk that?
- I'm not a big fish, William.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.624
- I'm Moby Dick.
- Even so.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.177
Those Nash guys are untouchable.

31:30.347 --> 31:34.307
I got 10 guys in lockup right now
for every one Nash soldier inside.

31:34.851 --> 31:38.344
When was the last time a shipment
of theirs got seized at the port?

31:38.522 --> 31:39.729
Doesn't happen.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.060
- Why not?
- Who knows.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.520
But what they say?

31:43.693 --> 31:46.936
Because the Nash syndicate
is protected by the cops.

32:02.337 --> 32:05.421
- Stop! FBI!
- FBI!

32:49.009 --> 32:51.752
So you confess
to murdering all those people?

32:51.928 --> 32:55.342
The Invisible Hand is
a corrective force.

32:55.515 --> 32:58.883
I corrected what I knew
to be wrong in the world.

32:59.060 --> 33:01.143
And you deny nothing?

33:01.313 --> 33:03.305
Deny it? I'm proud of it.

33:03.857 --> 33:07.817
Long after I'm gone, the story
of what we accomplished will live on.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.727
And what story is this?

33:09.905 --> 33:15.526
The story of six kids who lived on
the same cul-de-sac in an idyllic town.

33:15.911 --> 33:18.699
Six kids who thought the world was...

33:18.872 --> 33:21.615
...a beautiful place
where wonderful things would happen...

33:21.791 --> 33:24.955
...if they just worked hard,
played by the rules.

33:25.128 --> 33:28.087
If they were just good people.

33:29.216 --> 33:31.424
Then one day, they watched...

33:31.593 --> 33:34.927
...while everyone they loved got sick...

33:35.096 --> 33:37.088
...and died.

33:37.265 --> 33:40.804
Killers never held responsible.

33:40.977 --> 33:43.936
But you know
what those idealistic kids did?

33:44.689 --> 33:47.056
They stayed idealistic.

33:47.234 --> 33:49.851
They went out into the world
to try and change things...

33:50.028 --> 33:52.395
...make it a better place.

33:52.572 --> 33:56.031
Pursued careers to help
the powerless, unearth the truth...

33:56.201 --> 33:57.942
...and expose the bad guys.

33:58.119 --> 34:01.612
And they tried to see
the good in the world.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.907
And do you know what they learned?

34:05.168 --> 34:06.704
Doesn't work.

34:08.630 --> 34:11.748
The world hadn't changed.

34:11.925 --> 34:14.963
They hadn't made it a better place.

34:15.428 --> 34:19.217
And then one of our six heroes died...

34:20.183 --> 34:23.597
...of the same bone cancer
that took his mom and his dad.

34:23.770 --> 34:26.934
The other five met up,
after years away, at his funeral.

34:27.107 --> 34:30.396
And there, standing over his coffin,
a plan emerged.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.357
A new plan to change the world.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.271
Only this time...

34:35.447 --> 34:39.533
...being as ruthless with the world
as it had been with them.

34:40.579 --> 34:44.914
And this vigilante justice, you really think
that's what this world needs?

34:46.126 --> 34:49.494
I'm done trying to figure out
what this world needs.

34:49.670 --> 34:54.132
I will die knowing I did what I could.

34:55.385 --> 34:57.718
Just because something's legal...

34:57.887 --> 35:00.174
...doesn't mean that it's right...

35:00.515 --> 35:03.132
...or that it shouldn't be punished.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.554
What's wrong?

35:08.732 --> 35:10.815
How do you know something's wrong?

35:10.984 --> 35:13.397
I don't hear from you unless it's urgent.

35:13.570 --> 35:16.108
She was here. Masha.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.190
- How?
<i>- How is a problem, yeah.</i>

35:19.367 --> 35:21.575
Not as big a problem as why.

35:21.745 --> 35:24.237
She was here looking for Oleander.

35:24.414 --> 35:28.499
<i>She thinks tracking him down will
help solve her husband's murder.</i>

35:28.668 --> 35:31.160
What did she say? Be specific.

35:31.338 --> 35:33.830
Relax. She doesn't know Oleander's me.

35:34.007 --> 35:35.669
I certainly didn't tell her.

35:35.842 --> 35:40.132
<i>Since I know all you care about
is yourself, you can stop worrying.</i>

35:40.305 --> 35:42.262
<i>I didn't say a word about you.</i>

35:42.432 --> 35:44.594
My own granddaughter.

35:44.976 --> 35:49.641
Three feet away after almost 30 years,
I couldn't say a damn thing to her.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.686
- I can't talk about this now.
<i>- You should tell her.</i>

35:52.859 --> 35:55.101
Enough secrets.
She deserves to know.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.769
We'll talk later.

35:56.946 --> 36:00.940
Samar's here to question Bobby,
but I asked if you could speak first.

36:01.910 --> 36:05.529
Liz says he might be able
to help locate Tom's killer. How?

36:05.705 --> 36:08.493
I asked the same question.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.921
Hello, Bobby.

36:16.591 --> 36:22.053
You know, I once knew a man who was
shot 20 times in the torso and survived.

36:22.222 --> 36:23.963
Twenty times.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.306
Achiko Takahashi.

36:27.102 --> 36:30.721
- Who are you?
- You see, poor Achiko found himself...

36:30.897 --> 36:34.311
...at mortal odds
with a vengeful yakuza <i>kumichĹ.</i>

36:34.484 --> 36:37.568
- Guard!
- Oh, never mind. It's not a great story.

36:37.737 --> 36:40.525
Except for the fact
that young Achiko lived.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.235
God, apparently.

36:42.409 --> 36:47.700
He was absolutely certain
it was God who saved him.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.243
Which may be true.

36:50.417 --> 36:54.627
But science, believe it or not,
was somewhat on his side.

36:55.255 --> 37:00.967
They say over 80 percent of targets
on the body are not fatal.

37:01.136 --> 37:03.093
What about you, Bobby?

37:03.263 --> 37:07.883
After all those people you
and your friends have killed...

37:09.102 --> 37:11.970
...do you think God smiled
down on you today?

37:14.607 --> 37:15.893
What do you want?

37:16.401 --> 37:18.859
I want the one they call the Toymaker.

37:19.446 --> 37:22.905
I know he did work for the Invisible Hand.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.236
Word is, he built you...

37:25.410 --> 37:28.244
...some rather remarkable
surveillance equipment.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.779
Where can I find him?

37:29.956 --> 37:34.121
How do you know
about the Toymaker? You're not a cop.

37:34.878 --> 37:37.712
- Who are you?
- Answer the question, Bobby.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.293
Or what?

37:42.677 --> 37:45.010
Or I'm going to do to you
what those 20 bullets...

37:45.180 --> 37:48.548
...couldn't do to Achiko Takahashi.

37:54.481 --> 37:56.268
Right with you, friend.

37:56.441 --> 37:59.058
I appreciate your optimism, Mr. Bandicott.

37:59.235 --> 38:01.818
But I fear we aren't going to be friends.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.527
Please, call me Cleveland.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.488
You know who I am, Cleveland?

38:08.661 --> 38:10.448
Good. That's helpful.

38:10.622 --> 38:14.081
And only fair
since I also know who you are.

38:14.542 --> 38:17.000
The Toymaker. May I?

38:17.170 --> 38:19.958
I've always wanted a soldering gun.

38:20.673 --> 38:22.460
Here, you take mine.

38:24.761 --> 38:27.799
You won't need that.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

38:27.972 --> 38:31.386
I'm guessing you didn't drop in
to pick up a used VCR.

38:31.559 --> 38:35.724
A VCR? Gosh, I've got
a couple of boxes of VHS's...

38:35.897 --> 38:38.310
...in a storage unit somewhere.

38:38.483 --> 38:41.066
My God, I haven't seen them in years.

38:41.236 --> 38:44.400
A bunch of Laurel and Hardy's.
<i>The Conversation.</i>

38:44.572 --> 38:46.154
<i>Singin' in the Rain.</i>

38:46.324 --> 38:49.032
This is what we're here to talk about.

38:49.202 --> 38:53.947
You custom built this
for a drug dealer named Navarro.

38:54.123 --> 38:55.739
I don't know who that is.

39:01.881 --> 39:04.874
- Call me "sweetheart" again.
- Hey, I'm serious.

39:05.051 --> 39:07.418
Look, I'm cooperating here.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.837
Guy who came in,
I never worked with him before.

39:10.014 --> 39:13.974
He wasn't the kind of dude you say no to,
which I'm guessing you guys know.

39:14.143 --> 39:17.762
He never told me his name,
and I knew not to ask. That's all I know.

39:17.939 --> 39:19.646
That's not all you know.

39:19.816 --> 39:21.478
He had specifications.

39:21.651 --> 39:22.858
Definitely.

39:23.027 --> 39:24.984
And knew exactly what he wanted.

39:25.154 --> 39:28.522
And that eye was only the beginning.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.864
I built him what might be
the most advanced surveillance...

39:32.036 --> 39:34.574
...and countersurveillance gear
out there right now.

39:34.747 --> 39:37.160
And this man was familiar
with the state of the art?

39:37.333 --> 39:38.494
Are you kidding?

39:38.668 --> 39:42.082
We spent five minutes talking about
conical RF energy frequencies...

39:42.255 --> 39:44.338
...for handheld
wall-penetrating Dopplers...

39:44.507 --> 39:46.464
...in both azimuth and elevation.

39:46.634 --> 39:50.378
- Man, it was almost like the guy was...
- A cop?

39:51.890 --> 39:54.849
Thank you, Cleveland.
You've been a terrific help.

40:02.942 --> 40:05.309
- "Get ready to party"?
- Best I could do.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.694
They were fresh out
of "Sorry I shot you."

40:09.449 --> 40:13.864
Careful now. Dr. Lomay says to expect
some light bruising around the ribs.

40:14.037 --> 40:16.950
And don't remove
the compression garment.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.705
Compression?

40:22.253 --> 40:23.835
You didn't.

40:24.005 --> 40:26.292
I figured since you were going
under the knife...

40:26.466 --> 40:29.584
...it would be a good opportunity
to get it over with.

40:30.178 --> 40:31.294
Thank you.

40:31.846 --> 40:34.179
Give my regards to your new girlfriend.

40:37.143 --> 40:38.554
What about Big Willie?

40:38.728 --> 40:41.186
Doesn't he still wanna kill me?

40:41.356 --> 40:43.348
Get some sleep, Tony.

40:43.524 --> 40:46.187
Big Willie won't bother you again.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.862
I'm confused.

40:55.036 --> 40:59.531
You made it clear that coming back
to work on cases wasn't your top priority.

40:59.707 --> 41:03.246
It isn't. Under the circumstances,
it's best for everyone.

41:03.419 --> 41:05.251
"Under the circumstances"?

41:05.421 --> 41:07.913
Meaning that whatever
you learned about Tom's death...

41:08.091 --> 41:10.959
...you think having a badge
is necessary to get revenge.

41:11.135 --> 41:12.171
Why?

41:12.345 --> 41:15.338
Because I think
whoever killed Tom has one too.

41:15.890 --> 41:17.677
He's police?

41:18.101 --> 41:19.182
Federal or state?

41:19.352 --> 41:22.686
I don't know, but if he is a cop,
he's not the only one.

41:23.398 --> 41:25.060
And I'm gonna need you.

41:25.566 --> 41:28.934
Everyone if I'm gonna have
any chance of taking them down.

41:32.949 --> 41:34.815
Welcome back, Agent Keen.

41:36.119 --> 41:37.155
We've missed you.

41:38.121 --> 41:40.113
I've missed you.

42:04.731 --> 42:06.814
We gotta get everybody together.

42:06.983 --> 42:09.020
Agent Keen could become
a serious problem.

42:09.193 --> 42:11.776
- Why?
<i>- She worked her way up to Navarro.</i>

42:11.946 --> 42:13.062
<i>She killed him.</i>

42:13.573 --> 42:15.030
I'm more convinced than ever.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.573
We can deal with Keen.

42:18.995 --> 42:21.203
I'll call a meeting.
