YOUR WORKBOOKS TO PAGE FOUR?

09:07.060 --> 09:09.051
- OKAY.
- WE DON'T, UM--

09:09.100 --> 09:10.260
- I GOT 'EM.
- OH, WE HAVE WORKBOOKS.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.860
- YUP. ONE FOR YOU
AND ONE FOR ME.

09:12.890 --> 09:14.858
- SO TELL ME,

09:14.890 --> 09:17.097
IN YOUR MARRIAGE,
WHO WILL MANAGE YOUR FINANCES?

09:17.140 --> 09:19.165
- I WILL.
- WELL, WE--

09:19.210 --> 09:21.178
- WHO TAKES THE LEAD
WHEN IT COMES TO DECISIONS

09:21.210 --> 09:23.132
ABOUT YOUR CI-I'IIISIgS EDUCATION?

09:23.180 --> 09:24.829
- HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE THINGS?

09:24.870 --> 09:26.212
- WELL, WE GENERALLY TALK
ABOUT--

09:26.250 --> 09:28.627
- I MAKE A LIST.
- AND THEN SHE'LL MAKE A LIST.

09:28.670 --> 09:30.979
- ARE YOU SAVERS OR SPENDERS?

09:31.010 --> 09:33.877
- SAVERS.
- DO YOU HANDLE CONFLICT WELL?

09:33.910 --> 09:35.912
- YES, WE DO.

09:35.950 --> 09:39.226
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
WE DO...FIGHT.

09:39.260 --> 09:41.296
WE'RE A NORMAL COUPLE.
WE ARGUE.

09:41.330 --> 09:43.264
- YEAH, BUT THEY'RE NOT
REAL ARGUMENTS.

09:43.300 --> 09:44.676
I MEAN,
WE ALWAYS FIGURE IT OUT.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.166
- THEY FEEL LIKE REAL ARGUMENTS,

09:47.200 --> 09:51.022
BUT THEY'RE NOT REAL ARGUMENTS.

09:51.070 --> 09:53.095
- HAVE YOU BOTH CONSIDERED
WHAT RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION

09:53.140 --> 09:54.960
YOU'LL GIVE YOUR CHILD?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.106
- I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY GOING
TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO DECIDE,

09:58.140 --> 10:00.620
YOU KNOW, WHAT SPIRITUAL PATH
HE'D LIKE TO TAKE,

10:00.660 --> 10:04.175
MAKE SURE HE KNOWS
ABOUT ALL THE OPTIONS.

10:04.220 --> 10:06.871
- YEAH, BUT HE'S A CHILD,
SO, IN THE MEANTIME,

10:06.910 --> 10:09.117
HE'LL GO TO CHURCH HERE,
GO TO SUNDAY SCHOOL,

10:09.160 --> 10:12.186
AND...YEAH.

10:12.230 --> 10:14.949
- WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING TO YOU IN YOUR MARRIAGE?

10:14.990 --> 10:17.265
- HONESTY.
- COMMUNICATION.

10:17.300 --> 10:20.679
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
TO BE HEARD.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.711
- GOOD.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.888
WHAT IS YOUR VISION FOR
YOUR MARRIED LIFE IN TEN YEARS?

10:25.930 --> 10:28.239
- TEN YEARS?
- MM-HMM.

10:28.280 --> 10:30.168
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA BE DOING IN TEN DAYS,

10:30.210 --> 10:31.893
MUCH LESS TEN YEARS.
- OKAY.

10:31.940 --> 10:33.862
- I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT, LIKE,
THE POWER OF NOW

10:33.900 --> 10:35.276
OR, YOU KNOW,
LIVING IN THE MOMENT?

10:35.320 --> 10:36.833
- YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

10:36.870 --> 10:37.939
YOU HAVE A SON.

10:37.980 --> 10:39.936
IN FACT, LISTEN,
I WANT YOU EACH

10:39.980 --> 10:42.255
TO TAKE A PENCIL
AND OPEN YOUR WORKBOOKS.

10:42.290 --> 10:43.700
- THANK YOU.

10:43.740 --> 10:45.981
- I WANT YOU TO DRAW A PICTURE
OF YOUR VISION.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.989
[The Living Sisters'
Double Knots]

10:49.020 --> 10:52.262
[vocalizing]

10:52.300 --> 10:56.259
- I WANT TO WALK
DOWN TO THE BOULEVARD

10:56.310 --> 10:57.811
I WANT TO BUY

10:57.860 --> 11:00.067
A CANDY BAR

11:00.100 --> 11:02.204
I'M GONNA DRINK
- CROSBY.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.446
- TWO MARTINI

11:03.490 --> 11:05.299
GO JUMP IN THE FIRE

11:05.350 --> 11:07.386
I'M GONNA GET BURNED

11:07.420 --> 11:08.387
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE.

11:08.420 --> 11:10.217
JASMINE.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.763
WHY DON'T YOU SHARE
YOUR VISION

11:11.800 --> 11:13.040
FOR YOUR MARRIAGE
IN TEN YEARS?

11:13.080 --> 11:15.139
- MY BABY TIES ME UP
IN DOUBLE KNOTS

11:15.190 --> 11:18.466
MY BABY
TIES ME UP IN DOUBLE KNOTS

11:18.500 --> 11:21.981
- AH.

11:22.020 --> 11:24.500
- OKAY, SO I SEE WITH US

11:24.540 --> 11:26.883
WITH JABBAR
AND THREE MORE BABIES

11:26.920 --> 11:28.478
IN A HOUSE
WITH A GARDEN.

11:28.510 --> 11:31.752
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO HAVE FOUR KIDS.

11:31.790 --> 11:35.305
AND THE BALLET SHOES
REPRESENT THE DANCE STUDIO

11:35.340 --> 11:37.228
THAT I'D LIKE TO OPEN
OF MY OWN.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.273
AND THE MONEY MEANS
THAT WE HAVE SAVINGS.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.072
- PRAISE GOD.

11:43.110 --> 11:45.385
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL VISION,
JASMINE.

11:45.420 --> 11:46.523
CROSBY.
LET'S SEE YOURS.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.902
- YOU KNOW, I'M, UM,

11:47.940 --> 11:50.181
I'M KIND
OF EMBARRASSED BY MINE.

11:50.220 --> 11:51.528
I'M NOT REALLY A GOOD DRAWER.
- NO, BABY.

11:51.570 --> 11:53.288
- THIS ISN'T
ABOUT ARTISTIC APTITUDE.

11:53.330 --> 11:56.151
IT'S ABOUT--
IT'S ABOUT CREATING A VISION.

11:56.190 --> 11:58.499
- THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.
A VISION.

11:58.540 --> 12:02.294
- I'M GONNA PROVE I'M READY
TO FIGHT NOW

12:02.340 --> 12:03.887
WANNA JUMP IN THE WATER

12:03.930 --> 12:08.378
- THAT'S ME, OBVIOUSLY,
AND THAT'S JASMINE AND...

12:08.410 --> 12:10.344
WE'RE WITH JABBAR

12:10.380 --> 12:11.472
AND WE'RE ALL SMILEY,

12:11.520 --> 12:13.442
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I IMAGINE

12:13.490 --> 12:15.242
THAT WE'RE HAPPY
IN TEN YEARS.

12:15.280 --> 12:19.284
AND, UM...

12:19.320 --> 12:21.459
I GUESS JABBAR SHOULD BE
A LOT TALLER.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.310
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I MADE HIM SO SHORT.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.521
[erasing]

12:25.570 --> 12:27.970
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M JUST--
I'M NOT REALLY A GOOD DRAWER.

12:28.020 --> 12:31.535
SO...

12:35.090 --> 12:37.479
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

12:37.510 --> 12:38.477
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

12:38.510 --> 12:39.954
- AMBER, HE'S OUR DAD.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.479
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S SOME--

12:41.510 --> 12:44.206
- HE'S SOME CRAZY DRUG ADDICT
THAT WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO--

12:44.240 --> 12:46.379
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
TO YOU, IS THAT HE'S CHANGED.

12:46.420 --> 12:48.308
- SORRY, IT JUST DOESN'T WORK
THAT WAY, OKAY?

12:48.350 --> 12:49.863
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY?

12:49.900 --> 12:52.175
- WHAT DO I MEAN?
I MEAN THAT I REMEMBER

12:52.210 --> 12:56.283
SPECIFICALLY HOW THINGS WERE AT
HOME WHEN YOU WERE JUST A BABY

12:56.320 --> 12:57.594
AND DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

12:57.630 --> 12:59.598
- OKAY, LOOK, I WAS THERE TOO.
YOU WEREN'T THE ONLY ONE THERE.

12:59.640 --> 13:00.948
- YOU WERE BARELY THERE.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.254
YOU WERE BASICALLY A FETUS.

13:02.290 --> 13:03.803
- AMBER, YOU'RE NOT
THAT MUCH OLDER THAN ME.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.533
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I REMEMBER.

13:05.570 --> 13:07.151
I REMEMBER THOSE THINGS.
- OKAY, WELL, SO DO I.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.292
I HAVE MEMORIES OF HIM TOO.
- YOU DON'T KNOW.

13:08.330 --> 13:09.911
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HALF THE STORY.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.507
- THAT'S IRRELEVANT. THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.121
I'M NOT TRYING TO FORGIVE HIM
FOR THE PAST.

13:13.170 --> 13:15.229
I'M JUST SAYING
THAT HE'S CHANGED NOW.

13:15.270 --> 13:17.329
- WAIT A SECOND.
- LOOK, I ALREADY SAW HIM.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.473
I TALKED TO HIM.
HE'S DIFFERENT.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.511
- WHY DID HE CONTACT YOU?
- HE'S IN TOWN

13:21.550 --> 13:23.518
BECAUSE HE'S PLAYING A SHOW,
OKAY, AND I'M GOING.

13:23.560 --> 13:26.142
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY
NOT GOING TO HIS SHOW.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.408
- YEAH, I CAN,
AND I WILL.

13:27.460 --> 13:29.280
- IT'S SO STUPID
THAT YOU WOULD...

13:29.320 --> 13:31.424
- WHAT IS STUPID ABOUT IT?
- EVEN WANT TO GO.

13:31.460 --> 13:34.145
SECOND OF ALL,
MOM WILL NEVER LET YOU GO.

13:34.190 --> 13:35.259
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT MOM THINKS

13:35.290 --> 13:36.598
BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA TELL HER,
SO...

13:36.640 --> 13:38.392
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

13:38.430 --> 13:40.295
- OF COURSE
YOU'RE GONNA TELL HER.

13:40.330 --> 13:41.297
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA TELL HER.
- LISTEN TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

13:41.330 --> 13:43.366
- WHAT? YOU USED TO DO THIS
ALL THE TIME.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.981
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? YOU'RE
GONNA SNEAK OUT THE WINDOW?

13:45.030 --> 13:46.600
- I'LL DO
WHATEVER YOU USED TO DO.

13:46.650 --> 13:48.402
- LISTEN, I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU CAN'T GO.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.429
- WHAT ARE YOU--I MEAN,
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY OVER ME.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.232
- IF YOU DON'T TELL HER,
THEN I'M GONNA TELL HER.

13:51.270 --> 13:52.646
- NO.
- YES.

13:52.690 --> 13:55.204
- WHY WOULD YOU TELL HER?
I NEVER USED TO RAT YOU OUT.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.299
- BECAUSE IT'S DANGEROUS,
AND I'M NOT GONNA SIT HERE

13:57.350 --> 13:59.409
AND BLOW SMOKE UP YOUR ASS.
- HE'S OUR FATHER.

13:59.450 --> 14:01.247
- IT'S A SERIOUS SITUATION, AND
YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT MORE.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.077
- HEY, HEY,
WHAT IS GOING ON?

14:03.110 --> 14:04.907
- NOTHING.
- DON'T TELL ME NOTHING.

14:04.940 --> 14:06.384
YOU GUYS ARE SCREAMING
AT EACH OTHER.

14:06.430 --> 14:07.419
- YEAH, WE ARE.
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

14:07.460 --> 14:09.394
- DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT YOU NEED TO SAY?

14:09.430 --> 14:11.466
- AMBER.
YOU KNOW WHAT, FINE.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.297
YEAH, MOM.
DAD'S IN TOWN, OKAY?

14:13.330 --> 14:15.184
AND I SAW HIM,
AND I WANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.118
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU SAW HIM?
- I SAW HIM.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.502
- YOU SAW HIM,
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

14:18.540 --> 14:20.269
- NO, I DIDN'T TELL YOU.
- WHY NOT?

14:20.300 --> 14:21.574
WHY DIDN'T HE CALL ME?

14:21.610 --> 14:23.430
- WHY ARE YOU SO OPPOSED TO ME
HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM?

14:23.480 --> 14:26.131
- THIS KIND OF SNEAKING AROUND
IS VERY FAMILIAR TO ME.

14:26.170 --> 14:28.092
- WHY DOES HE HAVE TO CALL YOU?
- IT'S VERY FAMILIAR TO ME.

14:28.140 --> 14:29.346
- HE'S AN ADULT.
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO CALL YOU.

14:29.380 --> 14:30.517
- HE HAS TO CALL ME
BECAUSE I HAVE TO SEE

14:30.550 --> 14:32.518
WHAT CONDITION HE'S IN
BEFORE I ALLOW HIM TO SEE YOU.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.209
- WHAT, DO YOU NOT TRUST ME?
- YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

14:34.250 --> 14:35.512
YOU DON'T REMEMBER, OKAY?

14:35.560 --> 14:37.528
DO YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO THE
THREE OF US LIVING IN A MOTEL?

14:37.560 --> 14:39.141
I DON'T.
- NO, MOM.

14:39.180 --> 14:40.693
- YOU WON'T SEE HIM AGAIN
UNTIL I TALK TO HIM.

14:40.740 --> 14:43.208
- HE'S CHANGED.
- I AM GOING TO TALK TO HIM

14:43.260 --> 14:44.568
BEFORE YOU SEE HIM AGAIN.
THAT'S IT.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.603
MY GOD,
SETH IS IN TOWN.

14:53.090 --> 14:55.092
[door slams]

15:03.240 --> 15:04.650
- HEY, SWEETIE.

15:04.690 --> 15:07.102
- HEY.

15:07.140 --> 15:10.075
- HOW YOU DOING?

15:10.110 --> 15:13.523
- OKAY.

15:13.560 --> 15:16.211
- YOU'VE BEEN HERE
OVER A WEEK NOW.

15:16.260 --> 15:19.354
HAVE YOU...
TALKED TO YOUR PARENTS?

15:19.400 --> 15:23.985
- NO.

15:24.020 --> 15:26.363
- HAVE YOU TALKED TO ALEX?

15:26.400 --> 15:30.336
- ONCE.

15:30.370 --> 15:33.999
- HOW'D THAT GO?

15:34.030 --> 15:37.136
- UH, HE'S NOT GONNA DATE ME

15:37.170 --> 15:40.617
OR SEE ME UNTIL MY PARENTS
SAY THAT IT'S OKAY.

15:40.660 --> 15:44.448
- RIGHT. THAT'S ALEX.

15:44.490 --> 15:46.003
- BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER,

15:46.040 --> 15:47.382
'CAUSE THEY'RE NOT GONNA CHANGE
THEIR MINDS,

15:47.420 --> 15:50.355
AND I DON'T FEEL
ANY DIFFERENTLY.

15:50.390 --> 15:53.450
AND WE'RE JUST...

15:53.500 --> 15:55.968
STUCK.

15:56.020 --> 15:57.635
- YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

15:57.680 --> 16:00.319
IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T.

16:02.340 --> 16:05.434
I THINK
YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

16:05.480 --> 16:08.165
- I JUST--
I DON'T THINK

16:08.200 --> 16:12.546
THAT
THAT'S GONNA FIX ANYTHING.

16:12.590 --> 16:14.273
- WELL...

16:14.310 --> 16:17.620
THAT'S NOT WHY YOU GO HOME.

16:17.660 --> 16:22.484
YOU GO
BECAUSE THEY LOVE YOU.

16:24.810 --> 16:27.597
YOU KNOW?
YOU JUST GO BACK.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.734
I MEAN, EVERYTHING DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE SOLVED.

16:30.780 --> 16:32.395
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

16:32.430 --> 16:36.366
IT'S NOT MATH.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.095
YOU JUST GO HOME.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.371
- OH, OKAY, THIS IS NICE.

16:43.410 --> 16:45.025
THAT'S NICE.
- OH, YEAH.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.753
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
- OKAY, WRITE IT DOWN.

16:46.790 --> 16:48.610
- OKAY.
- HEY, BRIDE-TO-BE,

16:48.660 --> 16:50.582
MOM-IN-LAW-TO-BE.
- HEY.

16:50.630 --> 16:52.439
- HEY, CROSBY.
- HOW'S IT GOING?

16:52.490 --> 16:55.209
- PRETTY GOOD. WE'RE JUST
LOOKING AT RECEPTION MENUS.

16:55.250 --> 16:56.171
HERE.
CHECK THIS ONE OUT.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.529
- THAT'S REALLY NICE.

17:02.570 --> 17:04.561
BUT, UM, I THOUGHT
WE WERE HAVING THE RECEPTION

17:04.600 --> 17:05.498
AT MY MOM AND DAD'S.

17:05.540 --> 17:08.088
- WELL, NOW,
THAT'S VERY SWEET, CROSBY,

17:08.130 --> 17:09.438
BUT I'M SURE
THAT YOUR PARENTS DON'T WANT

17:09.470 --> 17:12.052
150 PEOPLE TRAMPLING
THROUGH THEIR HOUSE.

17:12.100 --> 17:13.533
AND EVEN IF THEY DID,

17:13.580 --> 17:14.569
WHERE WOULD THEY ALL SIT?

17:14.610 --> 17:18.819
- YEAH, WELL,
THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T WANT 150,

17:18.860 --> 17:22.546
BUT I THINK THAT'S
KIND OF WHY WE AGREED ON 40.

17:22.590 --> 17:24.820
- WELL, 40 WAS
ALWAYS UNREALISTIC, HONEY.

17:24.870 --> 17:26.314
- TOTALLY.
- REALLY?

17:26.350 --> 17:30.343
- YEAH.
- AS UNREALISTIC AS 150?

17:30.390 --> 17:33.245
- WELL, NOW, YOU KNOW
THAT I STARTED OFF

17:33.290 --> 17:35.212
WANTING IT SMALL,
BUT, CROSBY,

17:35.260 --> 17:36.807
YOUR FAMILY ALONE IS 40,

17:36.840 --> 17:38.467
AND THEN OUR FAMILY IS BIG.

17:38.500 --> 17:39.319
AND THERE'S ALL THESE PEOPLE

17:39.360 --> 17:41.396

INVITE FROM CHURCH,

17:41.430 --> 17:45.434
SO...
- YEAH, WE'LL MAKE IT WORK.

17:45.470 --> 17:47.609

17:50.620 --> 17:51.689

IN SEPTEMBER.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.651

ABOUT MY WEDDING DAY

17:59.690 --> 18:01.897
THAT YOU GUYS CHANGED?

18:01.940 --> 18:04.488
- CROSBY, RELAX.

18:04.530 --> 18:06.555
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

[rock music]

18:30.760 --> 18:32.489

- OH, HI.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.659
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

18:34.690 --> 18:35.691
- OH, SEE, WELL, NO,

18:35.730 --> 18:37.379
I CAUGHT YOU
LOOKING AT PORN.

18:37.420 --> 18:38.728
- OH.

18:38.770 --> 18:41.489
IT'S OKAY.
EVERYBODY--

18:41.530 --> 18:44.567
APPARENTLY THEY DID A STUDY,
AND 98% OF AMERICA

18:44.600 --> 18:45.806
LOOKS AT PORN.
- DAD, NO, I'M NOT LOOKING

18:45.840 --> 18:46.875
AT PORN, OKAY?

18:46.910 --> 18:47.899
- YOU'RE NOT?
- NO.

18:47.950 --> 18:49.679
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:49.710 --> 18:53.430
- I WAS--
I FOUND SOME VIDEOS

18:53.470 --> 18:55.506
OF SETH'S BAND.
I WAS JUST--

18:55.540 --> 18:58.429
- OH. SETH.
- SEE WHAT HE'S DOING.

18:58.480 --> 19:00.505
THEY'RE GOOD.
AND DREW'S 15.

19:00.550 --> 19:02.927
HE'S GONNA THINK HIS FATHER'S,
LIKE, SOME SORT OF CELEBRITY.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.894
YOU KNOW, THAT'S--
- YOU WANT ME TO GO KNOCK

19:04.930 --> 19:06.409
SOME SENSE INTO SETH?

19:06.450 --> 19:07.417
I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.553
- OKAY, DAD, WELL...

19:08.590 --> 19:09.932
- JUST ENJOY THE HECK OUT OF IT.
- OKAY.

19:09.970 --> 19:11.380
THAT'S NOT HELPFUL, DAD.

19:11.420 --> 19:15.311
- OKAY, LOOK IT.
UH...

19:15.360 --> 19:17.180
I THINK I HAD A HAND

19:17.220 --> 19:19.529
IN THE WHOLE SETH-DREW THING.
- WHY?

19:19.570 --> 19:21.561
- BECAUSE, WELL,
AT THANKSGIVING,

19:21.600 --> 19:24.364
I CALLED SETH,
AND I ASKED HIM TO TALK TO DREW.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.539
- DAD, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT.

19:26.570 --> 19:28.640
I MEAN, DREW IS LONELY.
HE MISSES HIS FATHER.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.887
AND HE SHOULD CALL HIM.
HIS FATHER SHOULD CALL HIM.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.785
HIS FATHER SHOULD KNOW
HOW THEY'RE DOING IN SCHOOL.

19:32.820 --> 19:34.617
HIS FATHER SHOULD KNOW
WHAT THEY LIKE TO EAT.

19:34.650 --> 19:37.619
HIS FATHER SHOULD KNOW.
BUT HE DOESN'T, YOU KNOW.

19:37.650 --> 19:38.856
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S HE'S SICK

19:38.900 --> 19:40.344
OR WHAT'S GOING ON.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.961
HE'S IN TOWN.
HE DIDN'T EVEN CALL ME.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.309
- HE DIDN'T WHAT?

19:44.350 --> 19:46.409
- HE DIDN'T EVEN CALL ME.

19:46.460 --> 19:48.553
- SO WHAT,
HE DIDN'T CALL YOU?

19:48.600 --> 19:49.794
- WHAT?

19:49.840 --> 19:51.489
- YOU WANT TO HEAR
FROM THIS GUY?

19:51.530 --> 19:53.282
- FOR THE KIDS, DAD.
FOR THE KIDS.

19:53.330 --> 19:55.218
- BULLCRAP.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, SARAH,

19:55.260 --> 19:57.353
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:57.400 --> 19:58.981
YOU'VE GOT FEELINGS
FOR THIS GUY STILL.

19:59.020 --> 20:00.464
- OH, MY GOD.
- YOU DO.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.910
- I'M TRYING TO MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISION

20:01.950 --> 20:03.884
AND TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.740
I DON'T HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM.

20:05.790 --> 20:07.508
- LET ME TELL YOU, SARAH...

20:09.790 --> 20:12.236
I LOVE YOU.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.373
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL,

BUT YOU GOT THIS THING
WITH YOU NEED A RELATIONSHIP.

ALWAYS NEED SOMETHING

20:19.630 --> 20:21.769
TO FILL WHATEVER'S GOING ON
INSIDE OF YOU

20:21.800 --> 20:22.619
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

20:22.660 --> 20:25.458
I MEAN, THIS GUY
IS A SON OF A BITCH.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.355
- DAD, HE WAS THE LOVE
OF MY LIFE, OKAY?

20:28.390 --> 20:29.709
BUT HE IS SICK NOW,

20:29.740 --> 20:30.809
AND I KNOW THAT NOW.
- THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.

20:30.850 --> 20:31.976
- I KNOW THAT NOW.

20:32.020 --> 20:33.806
- JUST LISTEN
TO WHAT I SAID, SARAH.

20:34.710 --> 20:36.701
[newspaper thwacks]

20:51.040 --> 20:52.109
KEEP GOING.

20:52.140 --> 20:53.937
- HEY, YOU KNOW HOW TO SAY
ICE CREAM IN JAPANESE?

20:53.970 --> 20:55.346
- I DO NOT.

20:55.390 --> 20:56.834
- AISUKURIIMU.
- I THINK IT'S TIME.

20:56.870 --> 20:58.417
- LET'S ADD IN
THE CHOCOLATE CHIPS.

20:58.460 --> 20:59.904
- THINK IT'S READY?
- YEAH, I THINK IT'S READY.

20:59.940 --> 21:02.329
- [sighs]
- ALL RIGHT. BE CAREFUL.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.328
- YOU WANT TO PULL THAT UP
FOR ME, HONEY?

21:04.360 --> 21:06.351
AND JUST SCRAPE THAT OFF.
- SUCCESS!

21:06.400 --> 21:07.981
YES!
- THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD.

21:08.020 --> 21:10.841
- I'VE DECIDED
I WANT TO PLAY BASKETBALL MORE.

21:10.890 --> 21:11.845
both: REALLY?

21:11.890 --> 21:13.403
- YEAH.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.408
I WILL GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY
WITH YOU ANYTIME YOU WANT.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.611
YOU JUST HAVE TO ASK.
- DUMP IT.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.538
- ACTUALLY, I WANT TO PLAY
WITH ALEX.

21:18.580 --> 21:21.686
HE'S A MUCH BETTER TEACHER
THAN YOU OR GRANDPA.

21:21.720 --> 21:23.517
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

21:23.550 --> 21:25.609
- BECAUSE I SAW HIM
THE OTHER DAY AT THE PARK,

21:25.660 --> 21:27.582
AND HE TAUGHT ME
HOW TO DO A LAY-UP,

21:27.630 --> 21:30.315
AND HE LET ME WIN,
SO I WANT TO PLAY WITH HIM

21:30.350 --> 21:31.339
MORE THAN I DO
WITH YOU AND GRANDPA.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.790
- OKAY.
WHAT PARK?

21:33.840 --> 21:35.353
WAS THIS--WAS THIS THE DAY
THAT YOU WENT

21:35.390 --> 21:37.324
WITH HADDIE AND AMBER
TO THE SCIENCE MUSEUM?

21:37.360 --> 21:38.941
- YES, BUT I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TELL YOU,

21:38.980 --> 21:40.390
HADDIE SAYS,
BECAUSE SHE'D GET IN TROUBLE

21:40.430 --> 21:43.319
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE SEEING ALEX.

21:43.370 --> 21:47.500
- OKAY, GUYS, LET'S GET THIS
IN THE FREEZER, OKAY?

21:47.540 --> 21:49.883
- YES.
THIS IS GONNA BE SO YUMMY.

21:59.490 --> 22:00.821
[knock at door]

22:00.870 --> 22:02.383

HEY.

22:13.090 --> 22:15.661
UM, COME ON IN.

22:17.990 --> 22:20.743
- NO.
COME IN.

22:23.580 --> 22:25.980
- I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE

IT LOOKS AWESOME.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.640
- YEAH, YOU KNOW ME.

22:28.690 --> 22:30.510
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE DECOR.

22:30.550 --> 22:33.997
WOW.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.861
- NO, NO, NO.
DON'T. DON'T.

22:37.970 --> 22:40.006
- WELL, I CAN...

22:40.040 --> 22:43.453
I CAN OFFER YOU
SOME TAP WATER

22:43.500 --> 22:45.730
IN A TOOTHBRUSH GLASS.

22:45.770 --> 22:48.637
- NO VODKA FROM THE MINIBAR?

22:48.670 --> 22:52.800
- WOW.
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE.

22:52.850 --> 22:54.886
- YEAH, I'M ASKING.

22:56.440 --> 22:59.159
- OKAY.
YEAH, THAT'S FAIR.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.576
NO MINIBAR.

23:00.620 --> 23:02.440
- ANYTHING ELSE?

23:02.480 --> 23:04.539
- COME ON.
- I'M SORRY.

23:04.590 --> 23:05.750
DOES THAT HURT YOUR FEELINGS?

23:05.790 --> 23:07.519
PLEASE.
ANYTHING ELSE?

23:07.550 --> 23:11.099
- NO.
I'M NOT USING.

23:11.140 --> 23:12.960
BEEN ON THE WAGON
NINE MONTHS.

23:15.490 --> 23:17.424
- OKAY.
REALLY?

23:17.460 --> 23:19.496
- YUP.
- OKAY.

23:19.530 --> 23:22.010
OKAY.

23:22.050 --> 23:23.779
- LOOK, I KNOW IT'S--
I KNOW

23:23.810 --> 23:25.869
THIS ISN'T THE IDEAL WAY TO--

23:25.920 --> 23:27.842
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THIS IS NOT IDEAL.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.438
IT'S NOT THE IDEAL WAY
TO SEE EACH OTHER.

23:29.470 --> 23:32.883
IT'S NOT THE IDEAL WAY
TO BE PARENTS, YOU KNOW.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.615
IT'S JUST
A REALLY CRAPPY SURPRISE

23:34.650 --> 23:36.572
TO FIND OUT
THAT YOU'RE SEEING DREW.

23:36.620 --> 23:37.541
- WAIT--WAIT A MINUTE.

23:37.580 --> 23:40.162
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
DREW WAS COMING TO SEE ME?

23:40.210 --> 23:41.586
- WHY WOULD I KNOW?
WHY WOULD I KNOW?

23:41.620 --> 23:42.518
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN

23:42.550 --> 23:44.484
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.
- I'M SORRY.

23:44.520 --> 23:45.999
HE CONTACTED ME.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.691
I JUST--I ASSUMED
IT WAS WITH YOUR BLESSING.

23:48.730 --> 23:51.767
I KNOW. DUMB.
- WHY WOULD YOU ASSUME THAT?

23:51.800 --> 23:53.495
HOW SCREWED UP IS THIS?
THIS IS SO SCREWED UP.

23:53.530 --> 23:55.634
YOU COME, YOU GO,
YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

23:55.670 --> 23:57.251
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW NUTS THIS IS?

23:57.290 --> 23:58.279
- I KNOW.
- YOU DON'T KNOW.

23:58.330 --> 23:59.843
I DON'T REALLY THINK YOU KNOW,
OR I DON'T THINK

23:59.880 --> 24:01.563
YOU WOULD DO IT
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

24:01.610 --> 24:03.771
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING HERE?

24:03.820 --> 24:06.573
- I GOT A COUPLE GIGS

24:06.610 --> 24:09.647
IN TOWN
OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND...

24:09.680 --> 24:11.159
- AND THE WIND IS COLD

24:11.200 --> 24:13.589
AND YOUR WINGS HAVE BROKEN
YOUR HEART

24:13.620 --> 24:15.542
- YOU'RE HERE FOR GIGS?

24:15.590 --> 24:17.615
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN CALL ME

24:17.660 --> 24:19.628
AT LEAST TO LET ME KNOW,
TO MAKE A PLAN.

24:19.660 --> 24:22.140
- IT'S NOT LIKE WE WERE
ON A CHATTY BASIS.

24:22.180 --> 24:23.488
- NO, IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE ON A CHATTY BASIS,

24:23.530 --> 24:25.009
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT US,
IS IT?

24:25.040 --> 24:28.692
- I KNOW!
I KNOW I SCREWED UP.

24:28.740 --> 24:31.186
I KNOW THAT I SCREWED UP
A HUNDRED TIMES

24:31.220 --> 24:32.664
IN A HUNDRED DIFFERENT WAYS.

24:32.710 --> 24:35.679
AND IT PROBABLY DOESN'T MATTER
THAT I'M--

24:35.710 --> 24:38.838
THAT I'M BEYOND SORRY.

24:38.890 --> 24:42.542
I REALLY AM.

24:43.860 --> 24:45.714
I WANT TO BE PART
OF DREW AND AMBER'S LIVES,

24:45.760 --> 24:47.751
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

24:52.730 --> 24:57.269
- YOU KNOW...

24:57.320 --> 24:59.242
THAT'S A HELL OF A KID.

25:01.740 --> 25:04.709
HE FOLLOWS US ONLINE,
THE BAND.

25:04.740 --> 25:06.526
- OF COURSE HE DOES.

25:06.570 --> 25:10.700
- I, UH, I INVITED HIM
TO COME SEE US PLAY.

25:10.750 --> 25:12.297
- OH, GOSH.

25:12.330 --> 25:15.197
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW.
OKAY, NO SURPRISES FROM NOW ON.

25:15.230 --> 25:16.857
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE MOM.
SO YOU DECIDE.

25:16.890 --> 25:20.712
WHATEVER--WHATEVER YOU THINK
IS RIGHT, DONE.

25:20.760 --> 25:21.784
I'LL DO IT.

25:21.830 --> 25:25.652
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S RIGHT.

25:25.690 --> 25:28.557
I DON'T KNOW.

25:28.590 --> 25:30.729
I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.

25:30.770 --> 25:33.147
- OKAY.

25:33.180 --> 25:35.000
- WITH BEER BOTTLES BREAKING

25:35.050 --> 25:39.180
BARMAID I HEARD'S PULLED
A GUN

25:41.740 --> 25:45.085
AND OUT TO THE BACK

25:45.120 --> 25:48.123
- IF YOU HURT THEM AGAIN,
I'LL KILL YOU.

25:51.650 --> 25:53.709
- AND OUT TO THE BACK

25:53.750 --> 25:55.957
THE POET WRITES HIS SONGS

25:56.000 --> 25:59.060
IN BLOOD

25:59.100 --> 26:00.829
- YOU KNOW, SO WE'RE SITTING
IN HIS OFFICE,

26:00.860 --> 26:03.693
WHICH APPARENTLY
BILLY GRAHAM DECORATED.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.584
THERE'S CRUCIFIXES EVERYWHERE.

26:05.630 --> 26:07.029
AND EVERY TIME
HE ASKS A QUESTION,

26:07.080 --> 26:08.661
BOOM, SHE'S GOT AN ANSWER.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.281
"ME. I'LL DO IT.
I'M IN CHARGE."

26:10.320 --> 26:11.662
AND IF I SPOKE UP,

26:11.700 --> 26:13.110
SHE CORRECTED ME
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

26:13.150 --> 26:14.356
- ISN'T THIS
JUST SOME FORMALITY

26:14.400 --> 26:16.800
YOU WERE DOING FOR HER MOM?
- YES, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

26:16.850 --> 26:17.942
A FORMALITY.
THAT'S MY POINT.

26:17.990 --> 26:19.321
IS I'M SITTING THERE
LISTENING TO HER

26:19.370 --> 26:20.701
ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS,
AND I'M STARTING TO REALIZE

26:20.750 --> 26:22.263
THAT THIS WOMAN
I'M ENGAGED TO

26:22.300 --> 26:25.121
IS NEVER GOING TO LET ME
MAKE A SINGLE DECISION.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.229
AND WHEN IT COMES TO OUR SON,

26:26.270 --> 26:28.124
I'M WRONG EVERY SINGLE TIME.

26:28.170 --> 26:29.717
HOW COULD THAT BE, ADAM?

26:29.760 --> 26:31.022
HOW COULD I BE WRONG
EVERY SINGLE TIME?

26:31.070 --> 26:32.378
I'M BATTING 1.000?

26:32.410 --> 26:33.616
- YOU'RE JUST HAVING
PRE-WEDDING JITTERS.

26:33.660 --> 26:34.729
- I'M NOT HAVING
PRE-WEDDING JITTERS.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.749
AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT JABBAR.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.176
IT'S ABOUT EVERYTHING

26:37.210 --> 26:38.791
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.798
I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE
A MUTE BUTTON INSTALLED.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.068
OKAY, I'M TURNING
INTO THAT GUY.

26:42.110 --> 26:44.283
"DO YOU WANT CHICKEN OR STEAK?"

26:44.320 --> 26:45.457
"I DON'T KNOW.
LET ME CHECK WITH MY WIFE

26:45.500 --> 26:47.764
AND SEE WHAT I'M ALLOWED
TO EAT THIS WEEK, ALL RIGHT?"

26:47.810 --> 26:50.210
I DON'T WANT YOUR STOCK ANSWER

26:50.260 --> 26:52.228
IN SUPPORT OF THE INSTITUTION
OF MARRIAGE.

26:52.260 --> 26:54.820
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT YOU THINK OF JASMINE.

26:54.850 --> 26:56.363
- STOP FREAKING OUT.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.777
I THINK THAT JASMINE
IS A STRONG WOMAN

26:58.820 --> 27:00.788
WHO HAS STRONG OPINIONS,

27:00.820 --> 27:03.641
AND I THINK THAT YOU CAN BE
A BIT OF A WAFFLER.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.306
- LOOK, I'M NOT YOU,
BUT I'M DOING JUST FINE.

27:06.340 --> 27:08.376
OKAY?
- YEAH, YOU'RE DOING JUST GREAT.

27:08.410 --> 27:09.729
- YEAH, I MAKE THE PAYMENT
ON MY BOAT,

27:09.760 --> 27:11.307
ON MY CAR,
ON MY MOTORCYCLE.

27:11.350 --> 27:12.749
I PAY MY TAXES.
- DO YOU DO YOUR TAXES?

27:12.800 --> 27:14.688
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.
I DO YOUR TAXES.

27:14.730 --> 27:16.311
I'VE BEEN DOING YOUR TAXES--
- YOU DO EVERYONE

27:16.350 --> 27:18.147
IN THE FAMILY'S TAXES
BECAUSE YOU'RE A CONTROL FREAK.

27:18.180 --> 27:19.420
YOU LOVE IT.
- I'M NOT A CONTROL FREAK.

27:19.460 --> 27:20.666
I DON'T LOVE IT.

27:20.700 --> 27:21.803
- AND I PAY YOU.
- YOU DON'T PAY ME.

27:21.840 --> 27:25.879
YOU GIVE ME MIXED CDS.
THAT'S HARDLY LEGAL TENDER.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.842
ALL RIGHT,
LISTEN TO ME.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.768
YOU'RE MAKING A COMMITMENT
TO JASMINE, ALL RIGHT,

27:29.820 --> 27:31.879
AND YOU BOTH ARE BRINGING
DIFFERENT THINGS TO THE TABLE.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.672
YOU'RE A LUCKY GUY,
ALL RIGHT?

27:33.720 --> 27:35.779
SHE'S ON TOP OF THINGS.
YOU'RE NOT SO MUCH.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.811
YOU HAVE OTHER SKILLS
THAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE.

27:37.860 --> 27:40.090
YOU'RE FUN,
YOU'RE SPONTANEOUS,

27:40.140 --> 27:41.926
YOU KNOW HOW TO DIFFUSE
A SITUATION WITH HUMOR,

27:41.970 --> 27:43.164
AND THAT'S NO SMALL THING.

27:43.210 --> 27:44.302
I MEAN,
MAYBE SHE CAN TOUGHEN YOU UP,

27:44.350 --> 27:46.068
AND YOU COULD SOT-TEN HER UP.

27:46.110 --> 27:47.828
YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE EACH OTHER.
IT'S MARRIAGE.

27:47.870 --> 27:49.269
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO GIVE
A LITTLE TO GET A LITTLE.

27:49.320 --> 27:51.459
ALL RIGHT?

27:51.490 --> 27:55.836
- YEAH. BUT I FEEL
LIKE I'M GIVING EVERYTHING.

28:00.230 --> 28:04.849
[chatter and laughter]

28:04.890 --> 28:06.812
- WHO TOOK
MY RUM RAISIN ICE CREAM?

28:06.850 --> 28:09.091
- HAD TO GET A BUZZ ON.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BLOUSE?

28:09.130 --> 28:11.439
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT EASY?
YOU'RE A LITTLE CRANKY.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.924
YOU'RE TAKING IT OUT ON ME
ABOUT YOUR ICE CREAM.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.131
- I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT LIKES IT.

28:14.170 --> 28:15.262
WHY WOULD SOMEONE TAKE MY STUFF?
- I'M SORRY

28:15.310 --> 28:16.754
THAT YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH SOMETHING.

28:16.790 --> 28:17.893
- THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING.
- BUT REALLY...

28:17.930 --> 28:19.272
WE'RE ON YOUR TEAM.
- JEEZ.

28:19.310 --> 28:20.720
- HEY.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.320
- HI.

28:23.350 --> 28:26.797
- SO, UM...

28:26.840 --> 28:28.239
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

28:28.290 --> 28:31.145
- OKAY, COME ON.

28:31.190 --> 28:33.181
I PUT IT IN HERE. JEEZ.
- YES?

28:33.220 --> 28:35.916
- AND...

28:35.950 --> 28:37.531
YOU CAN GO TO THE SHOW.

28:37.570 --> 28:38.946
- OKAY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

28:38.990 --> 28:40.321
- BUT, HOWEVER,

28:40.370 --> 28:42.838
11:00 IS THE CUTOFF, OKAY?

28:42.890 --> 28:44.505
11:00. I DON'T CARE
IF YOU'RE BACKSTAGE.

28:44.550 --> 28:45.926
I DON'T CARE
HOW MANY ENCORES THEY'RE DOING.

28:45.960 --> 28:46.881
YOU HAVE TO BE HOME
BY 11:30,

28:46.930 --> 28:48.136
SO I'LL DRIVE YOU
AND I'LL PICK YOU UP,

28:48.170 --> 28:49.512
AND THAT IS THE DEAL.

28:49.550 --> 28:52.792
- OKAY, BUT,
I MEAN, I'LL BE HOME BY 11:30,

28:52.830 --> 28:54.889
BUT CAN I TAKE THE BUS?
- YOU CAN'T TAKE THE BUS.

28:54.940 --> 28:56.441
LISTEN, I'M LETTING YOU GO,
AND THAT'S IT.

28:56.490 --> 28:58.071
SOMEBODY HAS TO DRIVE YOU.

28:58.110 --> 29:00.340
SO, PLEASE, THAT'S ENOUGH.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:00.390 --> 29:01.834
- I'LL DRIVE.

29:05.290 --> 29:06.871
- OKAY.

29:06.910 --> 29:08.559
- WAIT.

29:08.600 --> 29:12.388
WELL...
ARE YOU GONNA GO TO THE SHOW?

29:12.440 --> 29:13.884
- YEAH.
IT'S FINE.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.399
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.408
WHAT?

29:17.440 --> 29:19.237
- YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T--

29:19.270 --> 29:20.783
- WHAT?

29:20.820 --> 29:23.095
- YOU'D BE SEEING DAD.
- I KNOW.

29:23.140 --> 29:24.926
I GET IT.
IT'S FINE.

29:24.970 --> 29:26.039
- BUT...

29:26.070 --> 29:28.129
- EVERYONE WINS.

29:28.180 --> 29:31.138
OKAY?
- OKAY.

29:31.180 --> 29:32.135
- WE'RE GOOD?

29:32.180 --> 29:34.557
- OKAY.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.591
- I'M GONNA GET READY.

29:36.630 --> 29:38.518
- THANK YOU, MOM.

29:47.330 --> 29:48.297
- NO, I'M NOT EATING ANY KALE.
- MM, GOOD KALE.

29:48.330 --> 29:49.536
- I'M READY FOR ICE CREAM.

29:49.580 --> 29:50.535
- YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A COUPLE BITES.

29:50.580 --> 29:51.888
- I'M NOT EATING ANY KALE.

29:51.920 --> 29:52.784
- YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A COUPLE BITES.

29:52.820 --> 29:53.980
DO NOT THROW THE FOOD
ON THE TABLE.

29:54.030 --> 29:55.543
TWO GOOD BITES OF EACH.
- ADAM.

29:55.580 --> 29:56.854
- I WANT YOU TO HAVE KALE,
CHICKEN, AND RICE.

29:56.890 --> 29:59.472
TWO GOOD BITES OF EACH.
[door bangs]

29:59.520 --> 30:02.409
- ONE.

30:02.450 --> 30:03.894
- HEY.
- HI.

30:03.940 --> 30:08.274
GRANDMA DROPPED ME OFF.

30:10.490 --> 30:12.458
- ARE YOU HUNGRY?

30:12.500 --> 30:14.559
ARE YOU?
'CAUSE I HAVE SO MUCH FOOD.

30:14.600 --> 30:15.874
- YEAH.
- YEAH?

30:15.910 --> 30:17.639
- I AM, YEAH.

30:17.670 --> 30:19.319
- NO, HAVE A SEAT.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.157
- I'M DONE.

30:21.190 --> 30:23.226
- YOU HARDLY HAD
YOUR CHICKEN.

30:23.260 --> 30:24.579
HAVE SOME IVII\I%RE CHICKEN.

30:24.610 --> 30:25.918
I HAD FOUR BITES OF CHICKEN.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.052
- WHAT DID I MISS?

30:27.100 --> 30:28.237
- HI, HADDIE.

30:28.270 --> 30:30.261
- HEY.

30:31.510 --> 30:33.330
- WE MADE ICE CREAM.

30:33.380 --> 30:34.540
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TRY SOME.

30:34.590 --> 30:35.579
YOU HAVE TO CRANK IT
AT THE END.

30:35.620 --> 30:37.064
- WHY DID YOU GUYS
MAKE ICE CREAM?

30:37.110 --> 30:38.589
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU HAVE TO CRANK IT.

30:38.620 --> 30:41.100
- WE GOT AN ICE CREAM MAKER.
CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE-CHIP.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.459
- YOU HAVE TO PUT
A LOT OF SALT IN

30:42.490 --> 30:44.481
AND COOK THE MILK
AND ADD CHOCOLATE SYRUP

30:44.530 --> 30:45.519
AND THEN CRANK IT.

30:45.560 --> 30:46.663
- WHY DO YOU COOK THE MILK?

30:46.700 --> 30:48.213
- I DON'T KNOW.

30:48.260 --> 30:50.251
- IT HELPS MIX
ALL THE INGREDIENTS TOGETHER.

30:50.290 --> 30:51.632
- [laughs]

30:57.330 --> 30:58.604
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
WE HAVE A LOT OF PLATES.

30:58.640 --> 31:01.052
WHAT IF WE PUT
THE BOWLS UP HERE?

31:01.100 --> 31:02.476
I THINK THEY WOULD FIT.

31:02.510 --> 31:04.956
- MM, I DON'T THINK
THAT WORKS

31:05.000 --> 31:06.888
BECAUSE THEN THE BOWLS
DON'T REALLY GET CLEAN,

31:06.930 --> 31:08.158
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE
TO WASH 'EM AGAIN,

31:08.210 --> 31:10.064
WHICH I KNOW
YOU DON'T WANT,

31:10.100 --> 31:11.579
SO IT'S BETTER DOWN HERE.

31:11.620 --> 31:14.202
[speaks under
dishes clattering]

31:14.250 --> 31:16.002
- YEAH, THAT WAS
A TERRIBLE IDEA.

31:16.040 --> 31:19.032
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

31:19.080 --> 31:21.002
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU'RE ACTING A LITTLE WEIRD.

31:21.050 --> 31:22.597
HUH?

31:22.630 --> 31:23.494
[plate crashes]

31:23.530 --> 31:25.498
- I CAN'T MARRY SOMEONE

31:25.530 --> 31:27.111
WHO WILL NOT LET ME
MAKE ANY DECISIONS.

31:27.160 --> 31:28.468
OKAY, I'M STARTING
TO REALIZE

31:28.500 --> 31:30.183
THAT YOU ARE VERY CONTROLLING.

31:30.230 --> 31:31.982
I MEAN, HOW WE LOAD
THE DISHWASHER

31:32.020 --> 31:33.647
OR HOW WE UNLOAD GROCERIES

31:33.680 --> 31:35.432
OR THE TOILET PAPER'S
GOT TO BE UP

31:35.470 --> 31:37.028
INSTEAD OF UNDER
'CAUSE YOU LIKE UP

31:37.060 --> 31:38.573
OR THE FACT THAT THERE'S
NO WHOLE MILK IN THE FRIDGE,

31:38.620 --> 31:39.609
WHICH IS WHAT I LIKE.

31:39.650 --> 31:41.641
THE WEDDING.

31:41.690 --> 31:43.373
I'M GETTING
COMPLETELY LOST HERE.

31:43.410 --> 31:46.277
MY IDEAS DON'T EVEN EXIST.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.315
- OKAY.

31:51.350 --> 31:54.626
WELL, THANKS FOR TELLING ME
ALL THAT.

31:54.670 --> 31:58.288
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

31:58.330 --> 32:00.218
- I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY.

32:00.260 --> 32:02.080
- LOOK, I DID NOT MEAN IT
TO COME OUT LIKE THAT.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.259
BUT...
- YOU WANT THIS BACK?

32:04.300 --> 32:05.676
- NO, I DON'T WANT
THE RING BACK.

32:05.710 --> 32:07.632
- THEN WHAT THE HELL DOES
"I CAN'T MARRY A WOMAN

32:07.680 --> 32:09.329
WHO WON'T LET ME MAKE DECISIONS"
MEAN?

32:09.370 --> 32:10.473
- I WAS UPSET, ALL RIGHT?

32:10.510 --> 32:11.647
I'M TRYING TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.159
I CAN'T HOLD IT ANY LONGER.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.269
- YOU WANT TO LOAD
THE DISHWASHER?

32:14.310 --> 32:15.299
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE DISHWASHER.

32:15.340 --> 32:16.568
- WHAT IS IT?
- IT'S THAT YOU

32:16.620 --> 32:17.609
DON'T LET ME MAKE
ANY DECISIONS.

32:17.650 --> 32:18.651
- I DON'T LET YOU

32:18.690 --> 32:19.657
OR YOU JUST DON'T DO IT?

32:19.690 --> 32:21.305
- YOU DON'T LET ME.

32:21.350 --> 32:22.556
- YOU KNOW WHAT, IF I DIDN'T
TAKE THE LEAD ON THINGS,

32:22.590 --> 32:23.659
NOTHING WOULD GET DONE.

32:23.700 --> 32:24.689
- OH, REALLY?
- SO YOU CAN CALL IT

32:24.730 --> 32:26.584
WHATEVER YOU WANT,
CALL IT BEING CONTROLLING,

32:26.630 --> 32:28.143
WHATEVER--
IT'S CALLED BEING RESPONSIBLE.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.317
SOMETHING YOU NEVER KNEW.

32:29.360 --> 32:30.315
- 'CAUSE YOU FOUND ME
IN A DITCH.

32:30.360 --> 32:31.566
I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.704
I COULDN'T SHOW UP TO WORK
OR BRUSH MY TEETH.

32:33.740 --> 32:34.661
ARE YOU CRAZY?

32:34.710 --> 32:37.326
YOU COULDN'T COMPROMISE
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.566
- I COMPROMISE EVERY DAY.
- REALLY?

32:38.610 --> 32:40.089
WHEN?

32:40.130 --> 32:41.358
YOU DON'T COMPROMISE.

32:41.400 --> 32:43.709
WHEN WERE YOU GONNA TELL ME
ABOUT HAVING THREE MORE KIDS?

32:43.750 --> 32:45.718
- THAT WAS A WORKBOOK EXERCISE,

32:45.750 --> 32:47.672
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY
THAT MY VISION FOR OUR FAMILY'S

32:47.720 --> 32:48.789
SO TERRIBLE.
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

32:48.820 --> 32:50.333
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA DROP
THOSE THREE KIDS ON MY LAP

32:50.380 --> 32:52.587
LIKE YOU DID JABBAR?
- WHAT ARE YOU--

32:52.620 --> 32:54.167
WOW.

32:54.210 --> 32:57.202
- I DID NOT--
I DON'T MEAN

32:57.250 --> 32:58.649
THAT I REGRET--
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT,

32:58.700 --> 33:00.520
I'M HEARING A LOT OF THINGS
YOU DON'T MEAN TONIGHT.

33:00.560 --> 33:03.279
LIKE, YOU CAN'T MARRY ME.
I DON'T COMPROMISE.

33:03.320 --> 33:04.423
I GUESS I SHOULD RELAX
AND ENJOY

33:04.460 --> 33:07.327
YOUR AMAZING STICK FIGURE PLAN
FOR OUR FAMILY, HUH?

33:07.360 --> 33:08.736
SHOULD I DO THAT?

33:08.770 --> 33:10.806
- YOU ARE SO UNGRATEFUL,
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

33:10.850 --> 33:13.398
- UNGRATEFUL?
HOW DARE YOU?

33:14.440 --> 33:15.532
DON'T YOU CALL ME UNGRATEFUL!

33:15.570 --> 33:18.437
- YEAH, YOU GAVE UP
YOUR AMAZING SINGLE LIFE FOR US.

33:18.470 --> 33:19.471
YOU WANT TO HAVE IT ALL.

33:19.510 --> 33:20.716
YOU WANT ME TO PLAN EVERYTHING

33:20.750 --> 33:21.648
AND THEN YOU WANT
TO BLAME ME FOR IT.

33:21.680 --> 33:23.124
- I CAN'T TALK TO YOU.

33:23.170 --> 33:24.990
- THEN DON'T.
- YEAH, I'M NOT GOING TO.

33:26.790 --> 33:27.996
- [sobs]

33:35.560 --> 33:38.279
- I'M LEAVING YOU, BABY

33:38.320 --> 33:42.074
I AIN'T COMING BACK
FOR YOU

33:42.120 --> 33:43.144
GO, MAN!

33:58.240 --> 33:59.309
- THE '805 CALLED.

33:59.340 --> 34:01.137
THEY WANT
THEIR LEATHER SUIT BACK.

34:01.170 --> 34:02.478
- IT'S NOT A SUIT.

34:02.520 --> 34:03.509
THAT'S A VEST AND PANTS.
- IT'S ALMOST A SUIT.

34:03.550 --> 34:06.678
A VEST AND PANTS
IS ONE PIECE AWAY FROM A SUIT.

34:17.640 --> 34:20.700
[cheers and applause]

34:21.880 --> 34:23.324
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

34:25.330 --> 34:27.264
