00:58.292 --> 00:59.779
<i>~ Risin' up ~</i>

00:59.935 --> 01:02.348
<i>~ Back on the street ~</i>

01:02.637 --> 01:06.249
<i>~ Did my time, took my chances ~</i>

01:07.041 --> 01:10.325
<i>~ Went the distance,</i>
<i>now I'm back on my feet ~</i>

01:10.479 --> 01:14.613
<i>~ Just a man and his will to survive ~</i>

01:15.656 --> 01:19.422
<i>~ So many times, it happens too fast ~</i>

01:20.098 --> 01:23.304
<i>~ You change your passion for glory ~</i>

01:24.334 --> 01:28.035
<i>~ Don't lose your grip</i>
<i>on the dreams of the past ~</i>

01:28.171 --> 01:32.073
<i>~ You must fight just to keep them alive ~</i>

01:32.247 --> 01:36.516
<i>~ It's the eye of the tiger,</i>
<i>it's the thrill of the fight ~</i>

01:36.651 --> 01:41.016
<i>~ Risin' up to the challenge of our rival ~</i>

01:41.132 --> 01:45.381
<i>~ And the last known survivor</i>
<i>stalks his prey in the night ~</i>

01:45.516 --> 01:52.644
<i>~ And he's watchin' us all</i>
<i>in the eye of the tiger ~</i>

01:55.074 --> 01:58.693
- Come on! We made a deal.
- I know, but it's extremely crazy.

01:58.828 --> 02:02.279
It's mentally irregular, but
it makes all the sense in the world.

02:02.415 --> 02:05.120
- You owe me a favour.
- I know, but...

02:05.251 --> 02:08.537
- When did you think of this?
- About three years ago.

02:08.670 --> 02:13.464
- This is very crazy, Apollo.
- Stallion, when you won that last fight,

02:13.593 --> 02:16.131
you won by one second.
You beat me by one second.

02:16.262 --> 02:19.133
That's very hard for a man
of my intelligence to handle.

02:19.265 --> 02:22.052
Didn't you say you learned
how to live with it?

02:22.185 --> 02:24.224
- I lied.
- Oh, you lied?

02:24.354 --> 02:27.604
Oh! So now you just gotta
prove it to yourself, right?

02:27.732 --> 02:30.816
Just for myself. No TV,
no newspapers - just you and me.

02:30.944 --> 02:33.565
Nothin' - just you and me.
Age before beauty.

02:33.696 --> 02:37.231
- Anything you say.
- I do all the work. OK.

02:37.367 --> 02:41.661
I tell you, Apollo, you'd better go slow.
You ain't as young as springtime no more.

02:41.788 --> 02:45.999
- I'm still young enough to whip <i>your</i> butt.
- Oh, yeah? How you gonna do that?

02:46.126 --> 02:49.626
- You taught me everything you know.
- <i>Almost</i> everything.

02:49.755 --> 02:54.298
You gotta remember: You fight great,
but <i>I'm</i> a great fighter. You ready?

02:55.010 --> 02:58.510
- Absolutely.
- You know, Stallion,

02:59.390 --> 03:02.344
it's too bad we gotta get old, huh?

03:02.643 --> 03:05.099
Oh, just keep punchin', Apollo.

03:07.106 --> 03:10.439
- Wanna ring the bell?
- All right.

03:10.568 --> 03:13.059
Ding, ding.

03:13.696 --> 03:15.735
Come on, Stallion.

03:16.448 --> 03:18.524
Come on, come on.

03:18.659 --> 03:22.075
Boy, you really move
good for an older guy.

03:22.204 --> 03:24.244
- Look at him fly.
- Look out now.

03:24.415 --> 03:26.621
No, you don't want any of this.

03:26.750 --> 03:30.582
- Come on.
- Maybe I'm in here with the wrong guy.

03:51.818 --> 03:54.902
Dad, you're late. Mom's gonna yell at you.

03:56.031 --> 03:58.070
- So how you doin'?
- Fine.

03:58.199 --> 04:01.035
You know, don't you think
that's a little bright?

04:01.161 --> 04:03.866
- A little bit?
- Where'd you get that hat?

04:03.997 --> 04:07.781
- A friend gave it to me. Like it?
- Who punched you in the eye?

04:08.627 --> 04:12.576
- Same friend.
- That's weird. Better hurry, Dad.

04:12.714 --> 04:15.917
You know, you're developin'
a very, very loud personality.

04:16.051 --> 04:19.502
Don't go too fast,
or you're gonna get out of focus.

04:19.637 --> 04:21.677
Oh, really?

04:27.062 --> 04:29.101
- Yo!
- Yo. It's about time.

04:29.231 --> 04:31.057
I'm sorry I'm late.

04:31.191 --> 04:34.810
- Why don't you go and get ready to eat?
- Great. You're here.

04:34.946 --> 04:38.646
- Now you can stop calling him names.
- You been callin' me names?

04:38.783 --> 04:41.356
We wait any longer,
it'll be my next birthday.

04:41.494 --> 04:44.364
- Where have you been?
- Oh, gettin' punched.

04:44.497 --> 04:47.663
Bring the cake in and we can
get this celebration under way.

04:47.792 --> 04:50.958
- Boy, am I hungry.
- Baby, why don't you get the cake?

04:51.087 --> 04:53.708
We got a great surprise.
You're gonna love this cake.

04:53.839 --> 04:56.165
- And your present.
- Where is it?

04:56.300 --> 04:59.965
Let me set the mood. I gotta turn
the lights down and everythin'.

05:00.096 --> 05:02.421
- Watch this.
- Is it parked outside?

05:02.557 --> 05:05.226
Just be patient, would ya?

05:05.351 --> 05:08.222
I'm so excited, I'm startin' to sweat.

05:08.354 --> 05:13.182
I feel like I'm gettin' ready to go into
a big fight or somethin'. Watch this.

05:22.618 --> 05:24.990
<i>Happy birthday, Paulie.</i>

05:35.424 --> 05:38.093
- What the hell is this?
- Your present.

05:38.218 --> 05:41.801
I wanted a sports car for my birthday,
not no walkin' trash can!

05:41.930 --> 05:45.015
- Come on! He looks great.
- This is extremely psycho.

05:45.142 --> 05:47.633
You have no friends,
so we thought you'd like it.

05:47.769 --> 05:50.687
Pretend you're happy.
It'll keep you company.

05:50.814 --> 05:53.435
- That's a great-lookin' guy.
<i>- Please make a wish.</i>

05:53.567 --> 05:55.441
It's creepy! It talks!

05:55.569 --> 05:58.653
Creepy? I wish I had one of these
when I was growin' up.

05:58.780 --> 06:02.446
- Go on, make a wish, like he says.
- I wish I wasn't in this nightmare.

06:02.576 --> 06:05.197
Very classy wish. What do you think?

06:06.121 --> 06:07.864
Very good, huh?

06:07.998 --> 06:10.323
You wanna help me
put out this forest fire?

06:10.459 --> 06:13.792
- Sure.
- OK. On the count of three. One...

06:13.921 --> 06:15.960
two... three!

06:19.885 --> 06:22.922
- Well, they're out.
- You "drownded" me!

06:23.514 --> 06:28.342
<i>Oh, don't worry.</i>
<i>I'll clean it up for you, Paulie.</i>

06:33.775 --> 06:36.100
- Rocky!
- Yeah, you noticed.

06:36.236 --> 06:38.691
What are you doing with that cake?

06:38.821 --> 06:43.282
The party ain't over yet, you know.
We still gotta celebrate some more.

06:43.409 --> 06:46.613
- It's a special night.
- Yeah, it's Wednesday.

06:46.746 --> 06:49.415
It's Wednesday, but in case you forgot,

06:49.540 --> 06:53.752
it's almost been nine years since
you've been married to me, so...

06:53.878 --> 06:55.918
here's your prize.

06:56.047 --> 07:00.958
- But our anniversary's a week away.
- That's true, but... why wait?

07:01.094 --> 07:04.628
- Has it been that rough?
- No, no.

07:05.014 --> 07:08.466
I tell you, it's been excellent.
Open your prize. Go on.

07:08.601 --> 07:11.436
- Go on, open your prize.
- OK.

07:14.274 --> 07:16.600
- Do you like it?
- It's beautiful.

07:16.735 --> 07:19.024
All right!

07:19.154 --> 07:22.488
I was so nervous. I didn't know.
I... I hope you like it.

07:22.866 --> 07:27.410
The guy I bought it from says even if
it looks like a snake, don't worry,

07:27.538 --> 07:29.910
cos it won't bite you.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.825
It's beautiful.

07:34.295 --> 07:36.453
You know what's amazing?

07:36.589 --> 07:40.918
That after all these years,
everything still seems kinda new.

07:42.136 --> 07:45.552
You remember a long time ago
I told you that...

07:45.681 --> 07:50.094
I said that you ain't never
gettin' rid of me. Remember that?

07:52.021 --> 07:54.512
Well, you're not.

07:54.648 --> 07:57.104
You're never gettin' rid of me.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.693
Happy "almost anniversary".

08:16.671 --> 08:19.458
- A few questions, please.
- How long are you here for?

08:19.591 --> 08:22.212
- We talk later.
- When are you gonna fight, Drago?

08:22.344 --> 08:23.921
We talk later.

08:24.054 --> 08:28.466
Is it definite that the Soviet Union
will enter professional boxing?

08:28.600 --> 08:32.183
No more talk now.
We will talk at press conference.

08:34.397 --> 08:38.976
<i>~ Oh, golden dishes</i>
<i>from Church's and catfish at Church's ~</i>

08:39.110 --> 08:42.610
<i>~ Have some catfish from</i>
<i>Church's Fried Chicken ~</i>

08:42.739 --> 08:45.195
<i>~ Catfish from Church's! ~</i>

08:46.117 --> 08:48.655
<i>Today may be a landmark</i>
<i>in sports history.</i>

08:48.787 --> 08:52.998
<i>After unravelling years of red tape,</i>
<i>Russia will throw its hat into the ring -</i>

08:53.124 --> 08:57.371
<i>the prize ring. The introductions were</i>
<i>made by his wife, Ludmilla Vobet Drago -</i>

08:57.504 --> 08:59.413
<i>gold medallist in swimming.</i>

08:59.547 --> 09:03.592
<i>Today the Soviet Union has officially</i>
<i>entered professional boxing.</i>

09:03.719 --> 09:07.966
<i>My husband and great undefeated</i>
<i>heavyweight world amateur champion,</i>

09:08.099 --> 09:12.096
<i>Captain Ivan Drago, has come here</i>
<i>with his trainers to America</i>

09:12.228 --> 09:16.641
<i>to compete as an international</i>
<i>sportsman and ambassador of goodwill.</i>

09:16.774 --> 09:19.182
<i>Has he boxed against a professional?</i>

09:19.318 --> 09:24.111
<i>From having been trained in Russia</i>
<i>by great boxing coach Manuel Vega,</i>

09:24.240 --> 09:28.368
<i>and now by Sergei Rimsky,</i>
<i>we hope he's qualified to do so.</i>

09:28.494 --> 09:30.653
<i>- Hope?</i>
<i>- Well, I know he is,</i>

09:30.788 --> 09:33.872
<i>but I don't want to sound too confident.</i>

09:34.000 --> 09:38.994
<i>We would like an exhibition bout with</i>
<i>your famous champion, Rocky Balboa.</i>

09:39.130 --> 09:42.499
<i>You think he can fight</i>
<i>someone as seasoned as Balboa?</i>

09:42.633 --> 09:46.845
<i>There is no one who can match his</i>
<i>strength, endurance or aggressiveness.</i>

09:46.971 --> 09:49.213
<i>You make him sound indestructible.</i>

09:49.348 --> 09:51.140
<i>Yes, he is.</i>

09:51.267 --> 09:55.395
<i>Can this mammoth Russian,</i>
<i>nicknamed the Siberian Express,</i>

09:55.521 --> 09:58.606
<i>wreak havoc among</i>
<i>the professional heavyweight ranks?</i>

09:58.734 --> 10:01.900
<i>Whoever he fights first,</i>
<i>it'll be one hot ticket.</i>

10:02.029 --> 10:05.813
<i>We'll be right back with a check on</i>
<i>today's pro football sports scoreboard.</i>

10:07.075 --> 10:09.115
Dad, when can I learn to fight?

10:09.244 --> 10:12.530
- I can't hear you. What?
- I wanna learn to fight.

10:13.916 --> 10:16.585
Yo. Could you turn your robot down?

10:17.419 --> 10:20.622
You see, I fight so you don't have to fight.

10:20.756 --> 10:25.382
I want you to use your head for somethin'
instead of a punchin' bag, like I do.

10:25.510 --> 10:28.761
Your head doesn't look
like a punching bag.

10:28.889 --> 10:31.759
No? That's nice. Thanks a lot.

10:31.892 --> 10:34.134
It looks like a catcher's mitt!

10:34.269 --> 10:37.187
Oh! A wise guy, huh?

10:37.648 --> 10:39.889
Mr Balboa! Mr Creed's on the phone.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.567
- Yeah? I'll be right there.
<i>- You can get it right here.</i>

10:43.695 --> 10:47.823
- I hope it's not another rematch.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

10:47.950 --> 10:50.820
Hello? Yeah, Apollo... Turn that down.

10:50.953 --> 10:55.865
Apollo, how ya doin'? Yeah?
You're comin' out? That's great.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.085
What am <i>I doin'? I'm just gettin' dizzy.</i>

11:03.007 --> 11:07.301
My husband and I thank you for
coming to our training quarter today.

11:07.428 --> 11:11.675
As you can see, it is highly advanced,
and we wish to show the American press

11:11.808 --> 11:15.259
a small portion of the advances
our country has made

11:15.395 --> 11:17.637
in the technology of human performance.

11:17.772 --> 11:21.141
Coach Rimsky, what does this do
to enhance performance?

11:21.276 --> 11:23.315
- Well...
- If I may answer.

11:23.903 --> 11:27.153
It makes a man a better man,

11:27.282 --> 11:31.860
a great athlete a superathlete,
by harnessing all his strength.

11:31.995 --> 11:35.079
Though most of the world is
ignorant in body chemistry,

11:35.206 --> 11:39.952
- we wish to... educate your country.
- There have been rumours of doping,

11:40.086 --> 11:44.166
and widespread distribution of
anabolic steroids in the Soviet Union.

11:44.299 --> 11:49.175
- Has Drago partaken in any experiments?
- No! Ivan is naturally trained.

11:49.305 --> 11:52.389
Then how do you explain
his... freakish strength?

11:52.516 --> 11:55.850
Like your Popeye,
he ate his spinach every day.

11:58.981 --> 12:02.184
- Shall we have a demonstration?
- Please do.

12:02.693 --> 12:08.280
A normal heavyweight averages
700 pounds of pressure per square inch.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.085
As you can see,
Drago averages 1850 pounds.

12:24.590 --> 12:28.041
- So the result's quite obvious.
- And what results are those?

12:28.177 --> 12:31.094
Whatever he hits, he destroys.

12:32.181 --> 12:37.175
I've seen Drago fight when he was an
amateur. He's big and strong, but clumsy.

12:37.311 --> 12:39.768
I know I can beat him.

12:39.898 --> 12:44.441
- Why do you wanna fight again?
- Let's just say it's somethin' <i>I believe in.</i>

12:45.278 --> 12:48.813
- You can do your homework.
- OK. Later, Dad. Later, Uncle Paulie.

12:48.949 --> 12:50.988
- Later, Apollo.
- Later, big man.

12:51.117 --> 12:54.368
See you later, kiddo.
Don't you think people are expectin'

12:54.496 --> 12:59.952
- to see Rocky whack this bum out first?
- Yeah. And he will, when it's for real.

13:00.085 --> 13:03.536
- This is an exhibition bout. Kids' stuff.
- What's the purpose?

13:03.672 --> 13:07.883
What at this point in your life
is worth getting hurt for?

13:08.009 --> 13:11.592
<i>~ Double or nothin',</i>
<i>you've gotta have a partner... ~</i>

13:11.721 --> 13:14.391
- What the hell is that?
- That's my girl.

13:15.350 --> 13:18.636
<i>~ Takin' and givin',</i>
<i>it's time we started livin'... ~</i>

13:20.981 --> 13:23.685
- Thanks, honey.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

13:23.817 --> 13:27.601
- That's a nice song.
<i>- It's my favourite. You're the greatest.</i>

13:28.071 --> 13:30.360
<i>See you, sport.</i>

13:30.490 --> 13:33.860
- See you.
- Paulie, who taught it to talk like that?

13:34.787 --> 13:36.827
She loves me.

13:38.082 --> 13:41.249
<i>~ You stepped out of the night... ~</i>

13:42.545 --> 13:47.919
Like I was sayin', I don't want this chump
to come over here with all that hype,

13:48.050 --> 13:51.051
tryin' to make us look bad.
They try every other way.

13:51.178 --> 13:55.840
With Rock's help, we can get great
media coverage. We make <i>them</i> look bad.

13:55.975 --> 13:59.225
- I think it's wrong.
- No. It's never been more right.

13:59.353 --> 14:02.520
You're a great fighter,
but you've been retired five years.

14:02.648 --> 14:05.353
Isn't it time to start
thinking about something else?

14:05.484 --> 14:08.521
How much can you take? Either of you?

14:11.991 --> 14:14.030
I'll... get the coffee.

14:16.370 --> 14:19.288
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

14:19.415 --> 14:21.871
I just care about you both. I...

14:26.672 --> 14:29.129
You ever try these comics?

14:30.469 --> 14:33.339
- No, no.
- Keeps your fertility.

14:34.431 --> 14:35.973
Hey, Paulie.

14:36.099 --> 14:40.596
<i>In the ring now... Rocky's holding that</i>
<i>right hand. He's fighting right-handed!</i>

14:40.729 --> 14:43.054
Oh, now this was a great fight.

14:43.190 --> 14:45.977
Great! I'm gettin' punchy just watchin' it!

14:46.109 --> 14:49.692
<i>Mamma mia!</i> What you usin'
for a chin there, Stallion?

14:50.572 --> 14:55.530
- I should've slipped that one.
- You definitely should've slipped that.

14:55.661 --> 15:00.738
It's crazy how people just care about you
in that ring and when you're bleedin',

15:00.874 --> 15:03.626
but once you step out,
you're ancient history.

15:03.752 --> 15:05.709
It ain't ancient history.

15:05.837 --> 15:09.538
I don't see anybody askin'
for autographs, do you?

15:09.675 --> 15:13.886
Hey, Apollo... Can I... ask you somethin'?

15:14.638 --> 15:16.180
What?

15:16.306 --> 15:20.885
Well, this fight you're havin' against
the Russian. Do you think maybe...

15:21.019 --> 15:23.060
it ain't against him?

15:23.773 --> 15:27.438
If it's not him, Stallion,
then who's it against?

15:27.569 --> 15:32.693
Well, do you think maybe it's, like...
you against you? What do you think?

15:32.824 --> 15:36.240
You know, I think you really
<i>are</i> gettin' brain-damaged.

15:36.369 --> 15:40.319
Maybe, but... really.
I'm speakin' the truth here, Apollo.

15:40.456 --> 15:43.126
- Are you?
- Yeah.

15:43.668 --> 15:49.124
- I don't think I wanna hear this, Stallion.
- Hey, Apollo, you were a great fighter,

15:49.257 --> 15:52.127
but, look, we gotta face the facts too.

15:52.260 --> 15:55.012
You don't wanna believe it,
but maybe the show is over.

15:55.138 --> 15:58.258
That's easy for you to say.
You're still on top.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.096
What happens when
you're not on top? Then what?

16:01.227 --> 16:04.976
Where do we go, Stallion?
Cos we sure as hell can't be born again.

16:05.106 --> 16:10.148
I know we can't be born again, but, let's
face it, we... we gotta change sometime.

16:10.278 --> 16:12.816
I don't wanna change! I like who I am!

16:12.947 --> 16:15.819
I like who you are, too, but look at that.

16:15.951 --> 16:18.738
That ain't us up there no more, Apollo.

16:18.871 --> 16:21.741
We can't do that the way we did it before.

16:21.874 --> 16:25.574
We're changin'. We're, like,
turnin' into regular people.

16:25.711 --> 16:28.914
No, Stallion!
Maybe you <i>think</i> you're changin'.

16:29.048 --> 16:34.290
But you can't change what you really are.
You can forget all this money and stuff.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.468
Cos it don't change a thing.

16:36.597 --> 16:40.595
You and me, we don't even have a choice.

16:40.726 --> 16:46.266
We're born with a killer instinct that you
can't just turn off and on like some radio.

16:46.398 --> 16:50.230
We <i>have</i> to be right in the middle of
the action, cos we're the warriors.

16:50.361 --> 16:53.148
Without some challenge,
some damn war to fight,

16:53.280 --> 16:56.780
then the warrior may
as well be dead, Stallion.

16:59.954 --> 17:01.993
So I'm askin' you,

17:03.249 --> 17:05.288
as a friend,

17:08.712 --> 17:11.916
stand by my side this one last time.

17:14.886 --> 17:17.342
You're a great talker, Apollo.

17:19.974 --> 17:23.178
All right, but... when this is over?

17:26.356 --> 17:28.513
You know me, Stallion.

17:28.650 --> 17:31.106
I always think of somethin' else.

17:31.444 --> 17:35.656
That's what I'm afraid of.
All right. You got a deal there.

17:35.782 --> 17:38.487
I feel sorry for that guy, you know?

17:39.202 --> 17:42.820
What made you decide to put on
an exhibition fight with Drago?

17:42.956 --> 17:45.743
Let's call it a sense of responsibility.

17:45.875 --> 17:47.915
Responsibility, how?

17:48.044 --> 17:51.544
I had to teach this young fella
to box - American style!

17:51.673 --> 17:54.709
Isn't Drago a little inexperienced
to be in the same ring?

17:54.843 --> 17:58.461
Well, you know, some folks
got to learn the hard way!

17:59.723 --> 18:03.342
- No quick knockout predictions?
- No. I'm not angry with him.

18:03.477 --> 18:08.305
I just wanna show the whole world that
Russia doesn't have all the best athletes.

18:08.441 --> 18:11.774
Rocky, how do you think
Apollo should fight Drago?

18:11.903 --> 18:17.324
Well, personally, I think the first thing
you'd better get Apollo is a ladder.

18:18.284 --> 18:22.910
Drago, how does it feel to spar
with the great former champion?

18:24.332 --> 18:28.164
The man's tongue didn't
come through customs.

18:29.545 --> 18:32.214
My husband is very happy
to have this opportunity.

18:32.340 --> 18:35.127
- It's his dream.
- Dream? How do you mean?

18:35.259 --> 18:39.304
In our country, Apollo Creed is
well known and very respected.

18:39.430 --> 18:44.009
- It could be a good victory.
- Whoa! Wait a minute, now. Hold it.

18:44.143 --> 18:49.101
When? Now you don't really think
you're gonna whip me, do ya?

18:49.232 --> 18:53.099
- Well, he didn't come here to lose.
- You hold on, little lady.

18:53.236 --> 18:56.818
- Lose, and lose royally, he's gonna do.
- How can you be so sure?

18:56.948 --> 19:02.239
I've been with the best. I beat the best.
I retired more men than Social Security!

19:02.371 --> 19:06.203
Excuse, please. You are not
very realistic, are you, Mr Creed?

19:06.333 --> 19:08.326
What are <i>you</i> talkin' about?

19:08.460 --> 19:12.327
You can box, yes, but you are far too
old to think you can win over Drago.

19:12.464 --> 19:15.798
- Is that a fact?
- Yes! And it could be a painful one!

19:15.926 --> 19:19.509
Put that heavy bag with eyeballs
in the ring with me and <i>you'll</i> see pain!

19:19.638 --> 19:22.674
- Why do you insult us?
- Now you just hold on here.

19:22.808 --> 19:26.473
I'm not the bad guy. I came to talk
about a friendly exhibition bout

19:26.603 --> 19:30.601
- till Comrade Bigmouth started up!
- It is <i>you</i> who are the aggressor.

19:30.732 --> 19:33.567
I wish to say to the press, in all fairness,

19:33.694 --> 19:37.312
Drago should not even fight this man,
because he is a has-been.

19:37.447 --> 19:40.733
You get that big chump
in the ring right now...

19:44.204 --> 19:48.831
- Stop this before you get hurt.
- I don't wanna hear! Let that chump go!

19:51.796 --> 19:55.461
All right, all right. I've said what I feel.

19:55.592 --> 19:58.296
- We'll finish this in the ring!
- Wherever you like.

19:58.428 --> 20:03.255
You shut up, and all these puppets you
brought with you! You're history, chump!

20:03.391 --> 20:05.633
- How did I do?
- A little loud for me.

20:05.768 --> 20:07.927
- But good?
- Oh, yeah. Very good.

20:12.775 --> 20:16.026
<i>Welcome to the City of Lights -
<i>Las Vegas -</i></i>

20:16.154 --> 20:20.198
<i>and to one of the most unusual</i>
<i>events in years... East meets West.</i>

20:20.617 --> 20:24.116
<i>Age versus youth in</i>
<i>a goodwill exhibition match,</i>

20:24.245 --> 20:28.029
<i>as the former champion Apollo Creed</i>
<i>takes on a mountain of muscle</i>

20:28.166 --> 20:31.250
<i>from the Soviet Union... Ivan Drago.</i>

20:31.377 --> 20:33.287
- Come on.
- Patience is a virtue.

20:33.421 --> 20:38.297
- I'm ready to rock 'n' roll.
- You gotta get your equipment.

20:38.426 --> 20:41.131
- Now you look like a mummy.
- I feel like a mummy.

20:41.262 --> 20:44.596
- How does it feel? OK?
- Feels great. I feel like I could eat nails.

20:44.724 --> 20:48.094
- I never tried them snails.
- What are you talkin' about?

20:48.228 --> 20:52.178
Snails. I never had 'em. I see 'em in
the garden, but I never want to eat 'em.

20:52.316 --> 20:57.856
I didn't say anythin' about snails.
I said nails. N-N-Nails, Stallion!

20:57.988 --> 21:00.823
You look pretty good, but, you know,

21:00.950 --> 21:03.523
just do me a favour when you go up there.

21:03.661 --> 21:08.323
- Try not to wear yourself out, OK?
- Yeah, wear myself out. Sure.

21:08.457 --> 21:11.707
Well, it's just that you ain't
been in the ring for five years.

21:11.835 --> 21:16.747
- I just want you to... maintain a little bit.
- I'm in the best shape of my life.

21:16.882 --> 21:21.211
- I'm stronger, I'm quicker...
- Hey, I'm not sayin' you're not ready,

21:21.345 --> 21:23.966
but personally, if it were me,

21:24.098 --> 21:27.467
I wouldn't mind postponin'
a couple of weeks.

21:27.601 --> 21:29.558
Postpone?

21:29.687 --> 21:34.349
Come on, Apollo. We don't know anythin'
about this guy you're fightin', really.

21:34.483 --> 21:40.024
Let's say I postpone. I pull out, somebody
else steps in and whips this chump.

21:40.156 --> 21:44.071
- Then where does that leave me?
- This is just some kind of exhibition fight.

21:44.202 --> 21:47.986
- This thing don't mean nothin'.
- No, man. That's where you're wrong.

21:48.123 --> 21:51.408
This is <i>not</i> just an exhibition fight
that doesn't mean anything.

21:51.543 --> 21:56.288
This is us against them.
What are you talkin' about? Come on!

21:56.423 --> 21:58.462
Stallion...

21:58.592 --> 22:04.511
Maybe you don't know what I'm talkin'
about now, but you will when it's over.

22:06.474 --> 22:09.808
Believe me, you will when it's over.

22:19.571 --> 22:21.480
Ivan!

22:49.936 --> 22:53.102
Good luck. I hope after we can be friends.

22:53.606 --> 22:56.476
- I hope so.
- Of course. They're sportsmen,

22:56.609 --> 22:58.518
not soldiers.

23:01.530 --> 23:03.570
Enjoy the fight.

23:22.134 --> 23:24.507
<i>~ Ow! Get up! ~</i>

26:02.881 --> 26:05.337
<i>~ I feel good! ~</i>

26:21.568 --> 26:24.569
Good evening. Along with
Warner Wolf, I am Stu Nahan.

26:24.696 --> 26:27.899
We welcome you to an unusual
event: For the first time ever,

26:28.033 --> 26:30.606
West against East in professional sports.

26:30.744 --> 26:33.151
Thanks for gettin' me here. I owe you one.

26:33.288 --> 26:36.289
- Oh, no, no. We're even.
- God, I feel born again.

26:36.416 --> 26:39.750
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome!

26:39.878 --> 26:44.291
I would like to announce the presence
of a true fighting champion

26:44.424 --> 26:46.666
that defines the word "courage".

26:46.801 --> 26:50.384
The Italian Stallion: Rocky Balboa!

26:53.183 --> 26:55.721
- Excuse me, would you?
- Certainly.

26:58.438 --> 27:00.478
Rocky!

27:04.612 --> 27:08.526
Tonight's special event
features two great athletes.

27:08.658 --> 27:12.358
In the blue corner, weighing 221 pounds,

27:12.495 --> 27:15.864
a former heavyweight
champion of the world,

27:15.998 --> 27:18.536
the Dancing Destroyer,

27:18.668 --> 27:20.826
the King of Sting,

27:20.962 --> 27:23.535
the Count of Monte Fisto...

27:23.673 --> 27:26.958
- Think you got enough names?
- Be patient. Almost done.

27:27.093 --> 27:33.012
The Master of Disaster,
the one and only Apollo Creed!

27:35.518 --> 27:41.722
The crowd anticipating a great fight now
as Apollo plays to the crowd.

27:44.735 --> 27:50.074
In the red corner,
weighing an even 261 pounds,

27:50.199 --> 27:54.528
gold medallist and undefeated
world amateur champion

27:54.662 --> 27:57.284
from the Soviet Union,

27:57.416 --> 27:59.455
the Siberian Bull,

28:00.502 --> 28:02.827
Ivan Drago!

28:07.884 --> 28:10.921
I want you! I want <i>you!</i> I want <i>you!</i>

28:11.054 --> 28:15.847
The two fighters come to the centre
for instructions from referee Lou Filippo.

28:15.976 --> 28:20.519
You know the rules. Watch the low blows,
kidney punches and rabbit punches.

28:20.647 --> 28:25.226
In case of a knockdown, go to the corner
and stay there until I tell you to come out.

28:25.360 --> 28:29.939
- Shake hands. Let's have a good fight.
- It's time to go to school, son.

28:30.073 --> 28:35.316
Get your hands up! Do you need an
interpreter? It's time to go to school!

28:35.454 --> 28:37.909
You will lose.

28:41.126 --> 28:41.971
All right!

28:42.075 --> 28:45.376
The bad blood between these two
can be felt all over this arena.

28:45.505 --> 28:48.506
I can't get over the size of this Russian!

28:49.801 --> 28:53.053
- Apollo! Apollo!
- Get ready, cos it's showtime! Showtime!

28:53.181 --> 28:58.519
- It's showtime!
- Excuse me. Didn't you forget somethin'?

28:58.645 --> 29:00.851
Apollo seems to be in great spirits.

29:00.980 --> 29:05.060
He's really putting on a show
for this capacity crowd.

29:05.193 --> 29:06.604
Be back in a minute, all right?

29:08.863 --> 29:10.939
Round one.

29:12.033 --> 29:13.776
Creed's dancing around.

29:13.910 --> 29:17.575
Creed back-pedalling now.
He's been away five years.

29:27.298 --> 29:32.838
Neither fighter ready to throw a punch.
A left jab there... and once again.

29:36.516 --> 29:39.185
- A slip by Creed.
- This is bizarre.

29:39.310 --> 29:43.889
Creed is over the hill, and...
the Russian hasn't fought anybody.

29:52.908 --> 29:55.909
- Keep movin'. Stick him!
- Drago's moving in again.

29:56.036 --> 30:00.532
A left hand by Creed. Another left hand
by Creed, and Drago moves away.

30:07.756 --> 30:12.584
Another left hand by Creed. Drago
waiting, waiting, cocking that right hand.

30:15.723 --> 30:18.130
A punishing right by the Russian.

30:18.267 --> 30:21.137
Get outta there! Get outta there!

30:21.270 --> 30:25.481
A left. He's taking some punishment now.
Drago moves him against the ropes.

30:25.608 --> 30:26.806
Tie him up now!

30:26.942 --> 30:30.726
The Russian ties him up
and throws Creed across the ring!

30:30.863 --> 30:32.939
Move!

30:33.115 --> 30:36.365
It is Drago with the upper hand now.

30:36.493 --> 30:38.403
Get outta that corner!

30:38.538 --> 30:41.112
Another right! Another right!

30:45.128 --> 30:49.375
Creed is against the ropes!
I think they may stop it.

30:49.507 --> 30:55.343
What are you guys doin'?!
This is supposed to be an exhibition!

30:55.472 --> 31:01.676
Tremendous end to the first round by the
Russian, and a very bloody Apollo Creed.

31:03.229 --> 31:05.388
The Soviet's strength is incredible!

31:05.523 --> 31:09.901
Champ, look. I gotta stop ya.
This fight's finished. I gotta call it.

31:10.028 --> 31:12.899
- You can't do no more.
- I'm here to fight him.

31:13.031 --> 31:17.942
- He's killin' ya! I gotta stop this thing.
- Promise me you're not gonna stop it.

31:18.078 --> 31:21.612
That was a pulverising round
for the ex-champion.

31:21.748 --> 31:25.793
Hey, folks. Ivan Drago is definitely for real.

31:27.045 --> 31:30.248
You don't stop this fight, no matter what.

31:30.382 --> 31:32.422
Apollo! Apollo!

31:35.513 --> 31:37.552
No matter what.

31:45.731 --> 31:48.602
Creed now comes out
for round two dancing around.

31:48.734 --> 31:51.652
The legs appear to be still a little rubbery.

31:51.779 --> 31:54.270
Get your hands up.

31:55.157 --> 31:59.950
And now it is the Russian just standing
there, trying to intimidate Creed.

32:00.746 --> 32:06.037
And the Russian throws a right hand
to the jaw! Another right to the head!

32:11.132 --> 32:13.967
Creed's being pounded without mercy!

32:14.093 --> 32:16.299
Stop the fight!

32:16.429 --> 32:21.221
- The referee is thrown across the ring!
- Throw the towel! Throw the towel!

32:23.853 --> 32:28.682
- I've never seen Apollo take so much.
- Throw the damn towel!

32:34.531 --> 32:37.069
No!

32:47.294 --> 32:50.081
- My God!
- Creed is down!

32:52.007 --> 32:55.043
Apollo is down,
and he could be badly hurt.

32:56.678 --> 32:59.964
- Get these guys outta here.
- The winner, Ivan Drago.

33:00.098 --> 33:03.930
- Let me through! Apollo!
- I cannot be defeated.

33:04.061 --> 33:06.468
- Is he OK?
- Somebody get a doctor in here!

33:06.605 --> 33:11.018
- There is no movement by Creed.
- I defeat old man.

33:11.151 --> 33:13.060
- Is he dead?
- Get outta here!

33:13.195 --> 33:15.271
It's absolute pandemonium!

33:16.323 --> 33:18.731
Will ya let him breathe?

33:18.867 --> 33:22.118
Soon... I defeat real champion.

33:22.247 --> 33:25.829
Where's the stretcher?
Let him breathe, for God's sake!

33:25.959 --> 33:29.493
What started out as a joke
has turned out to be a disaster.

33:29.629 --> 33:31.871
Creed is in a very serious condition.

33:32.006 --> 33:34.332
- Is the man alive?
- You can make it, Apollo.

33:34.467 --> 33:36.756
If he dies... he dies.

33:56.781 --> 34:00.232
There's a lot I could say... about this man.

34:02.412 --> 34:05.033
But I don't know if it matters now.

34:05.873 --> 34:08.364
I guess what matters is...

34:08.501 --> 34:10.956
what he stood for,

34:12.045 --> 34:14.503
what he lived for, and...

34:15.801 --> 34:18.292
what he died for.

34:20.222 --> 34:22.678
You always did everything...

34:24.351 --> 34:26.806
the way <i>you</i> wanted it.

34:29.773 --> 34:32.858
I know I didn't understand that, but...

34:38.824 --> 34:41.908
now I understand.

34:46.040 --> 34:48.495
I'll never forget you, Apollo.

35:06.602 --> 35:08.477
You're the best.

35:19.616 --> 35:22.985
- Rocky, is the decision final?
- Yes.

35:23.119 --> 35:26.738
Is this the first time
the champion has given up his crown?

35:26.873 --> 35:30.372
- I don't know about that.
- Doesn't the title matter?

35:30.502 --> 35:32.744
Not until this is over.

35:32.879 --> 35:37.173
Considering Rocky's punching power,
do you still expect an easy fight?

35:37.300 --> 35:40.550
- Yes, of course.
- It's a matter of size...

35:41.471 --> 35:48.055
and evolution. Isn't it, gentlemen? Drago
is the most perfectly trained athlete ever.

35:48.186 --> 35:53.228
This other man has not the size,
or the endurance, or the genetics to win.

35:53.358 --> 35:57.023
It's physically impossible
for this little man to win.

35:57.153 --> 36:00.404
Drago is a look at the future.

36:00.532 --> 36:04.862
Champ, how much
are you making for this fight?

36:04.996 --> 36:09.076
- No money. It's not about money.
- Has the fight date been set yet?

36:09.208 --> 36:11.877
- December 25th.
- Why Christmas?

36:12.003 --> 36:14.410
- That's what I was told.
- Where?

36:14.547 --> 36:16.670
- It's in Russia.
- Are you nuts?

36:16.799 --> 36:19.255
Rocky, what's going on?

36:19.385 --> 36:22.836
We fight in Soviet Union,
or we fight nowhere.

36:23.097 --> 36:27.309
Why don't you ask Drago's wife
why she is afraid? Tell them, please.

36:27.435 --> 36:32.642
I'm afraid for my husband's life.
We have threats of violence everywhere.

36:33.816 --> 36:39.652
We are not in politics. All I want is for my
husband to be safe, to be treated fairly.

36:39.780 --> 36:44.241
You call him a killer.
He's a professional fighter, not a killer.

36:44.368 --> 36:47.784
You have this belief that
you are better than us,

36:47.913 --> 36:51.911
that this country is so very good,
and we are so very bad.

36:52.335 --> 36:56.035
You have this belief that you are so fair,
and we are so very cruel.

36:56.173 --> 36:58.249
It is lies and false propaganda

36:58.383 --> 37:02.595
to support this antagonistic
and violent government!

37:02.971 --> 37:07.847
Violent? We don't keep our people
behind a wall with machine guns!

37:07.976 --> 37:10.265
- Who are you?
- Who am <i>I?</i>

37:10.395 --> 37:14.891
- I'm... the unsilent majority, bigmouth!
- Good! Yes, good!

37:15.025 --> 37:20.268
Insult us! Is more typical rude behaviour
towards visiting foreigners!

37:20.405 --> 37:24.901
But perhaps this simple defeat
of this little so-called champion

37:25.243 --> 37:29.027
will be a perfect example
of how pathetically weak

37:29.164 --> 37:32.248
your society has become. We go!

37:41.218 --> 37:44.053
Mrs Balboa!

37:44.179 --> 37:47.548
- How do you feel about Russia?
- Is your husband going to Moscow?

37:47.683 --> 37:52.642
How does it feel to be part of
such a controversial decision?

37:52.772 --> 37:55.393
Did Creed's death
make up your husband's mind?

37:55.525 --> 38:00.400
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- Why is he going at Christmas?

38:01.406 --> 38:03.731
When will you be going to Russia?

38:03.866 --> 38:07.947
I'm not going to Russia. I don't know
what you're talking about!

38:08.079 --> 38:11.115
I don't know what you
people are doing here!

38:37.233 --> 38:39.273
- Rocky?
- Yeah?

38:44.116 --> 38:46.821
- You all right?
- Yeah.

38:46.952 --> 38:48.779
Fine.

38:48.912 --> 38:50.952
Why'd you do it?

38:53.834 --> 38:58.461
- I just gotta do what I gotta do.
- You don't have to do anything.

39:01.133 --> 39:07.088
No, Adrian, I do, and...
I gotta leave this place, too.

39:07.389 --> 39:09.678
So where are you... going?

39:09.808 --> 39:13.343
They said they were gonna
let me train in Russia.

39:13.479 --> 39:18.721
I just wanna go someplace where I ain't
gonna think about nothin' except him.

39:18.859 --> 39:22.809
Rocky, give it some time. Don't do this.

39:22.947 --> 39:25.105
A lot of people live with hurt.

39:25.240 --> 39:28.076
A lot of people don't have a choice. I do.

39:28.202 --> 39:31.487
And for that you're willing
to lose everything?

39:31.622 --> 39:34.077
Adrian, this ain't everything.

39:35.334 --> 39:40.127
This house, and the cars, and all
the stuff we got... that ain't everything.

39:42.759 --> 39:45.380
There's a lot more than this, Adrian.

39:45.512 --> 39:49.556
Before, there were reasons to fight I
understood, but I don't understand this.

39:49.683 --> 39:53.383
Even if you win, what have you won?
Apollo's still gone.

39:54.104 --> 39:57.140
Why can't you change your thinking?
Everybody else does!

39:57.274 --> 40:01.105
Cos I'm a fighter!
That's the way I'm made, Adrian.

40:02.320 --> 40:06.188
That's what you married.
We can't change what we are.

40:06.324 --> 40:09.409
- Yes, you can.
- You can't change anythin'.

40:09.536 --> 40:13.616
- All we can do is go with what we are.
- You can't go with what you are!

40:13.748 --> 40:17.200
Have you read the papers?
Do you know what everybody says?

40:17.335 --> 40:21.665
It's suicide! You've seen him.
You know how strong he is.

40:22.299 --> 40:24.338
You can't win!

40:28.013 --> 40:30.052
Oh, Adrian.

40:33.060 --> 40:35.516
Adrian always tells the truth.

40:36.314 --> 40:38.353
No, maybe I can't win.

40:40.526 --> 40:42.982
Maybe the only thing I can do...

40:43.946 --> 40:47.031
is just take everythin' he's got.

40:47.158 --> 40:50.942
But to beat me...
he's gonna have to kill me.

40:52.204 --> 40:57.709
And to kill me, he's gonna have to
have the heart to stand in front of me.

40:59.337 --> 41:03.915
And to do that, he's gotta
be willin' to die himself.

41:05.468 --> 41:08.504
And I don't know if he's ready to do that.

41:08.638 --> 41:10.677
I don't know.

42:02.401 --> 42:05.271
<i>~ We're not indestructible ~</i>

42:06.363 --> 42:09.280
<i>~ Baby, better get that straight ~</i>

42:09.825 --> 42:12.991
<i>~ I think it's unbelievable ~</i>

42:13.287 --> 42:16.656
<i>~ How you give in to the hands of fate ~</i>

42:17.499 --> 42:20.073

42:28.678 --> 42:32.094
<i>~ I just wanna know why ~</i>

42:33.266 --> 42:35.757
<i>~ There's no easy way out ~</i>

42:37.061 --> 42:39.766
<i>~ There's no shortcut home ~</i>

42:40.773 --> 42:43.644
<i>~ There's no easy way out ~</i>

42:44.444 --> 42:48.109
<i>~ Givin' in can't be wrong ~</i>

42:50.825 --> 42:53.696
<i>~ I don't wanna pacify you~</i>

42:54.704 --> 42:57.990
<i>~ I don't wanna drag you down ~</i>

42:58.124 --> 43:00.745
<i>~ But I'm feelin' like a prisoner ~</i>

43:01.753 --> 43:05.371
<i>~ Like a stranger in a no-name town ~</i>

43:06.090 --> 43:09.340
<i>~ I see only angry faces ~</i>

43:09.761 --> 43:12.678
<i>~ So afraid that could be you and me ~</i>

43:13.264 --> 43:16.432
<i>~ Talkin' about what might have been ~</i>

43:16.936 --> 43:20.269
<i>~ And thinkin' about what used to be ~</i>

43:21.690 --> 43:23.730
<i>~ There's no easy way out ~</i>

43:25.277 --> 43:28.397

<i>~ There's no easy way out ~</i>

43:33.035 --> 43:36.404

44:00.813 --> 44:04.063
<i>~ Baby, baby, we can shed this skin ~</i>

44:04.733 --> 44:08.020
<i>~ We can know how we feel inside ~</i>

44:08.154 --> 44:11.689
<i>~ Instead of goin' down an endless road ~</i>

44:12.158 --> 44:15.610
<i>~ Not knowin' if we're dead or alive ~</i>

44:16.329 --> 44:18.903

44:35.557 --> 44:38.309
<i>~ There's no shortcut home ~</i>

45:12.136 --> 45:14.709
<i>~ No easy, no easy way out ~</i>

<i>~ There's no easy way out ~</i>

45:19.644 --> 45:22.313
<i>~ There's no shortcut home ~</i>

45:23.064 --> 45:26.148
<i>~ There's no easy way out ~</i>

45:49.340 --> 45:53.172
<i>Be careful with those plaid ones.</i>
<i>They belong to the boss.</i>

45:53.302 --> 45:57.930
<i>Paulie, did you pack your toothbrush?</i>
<i>You know how tobacco stains your teeth.</i>

45:58.058 --> 46:01.509
<i>- If I've told you once, I've told you...</i>
- Hey! Hey!

46:01.645 --> 46:05.263
- Stop bustin' my chops.
<i>- Paulie!</i>

46:05.399 --> 46:09.313
I'm gonna have her wires
tied when I get back.

46:10.362 --> 46:12.935
When will you be back?

46:13.073 --> 46:15.529
- Oh, pretty soon.
- Are you scared?

46:16.994 --> 46:20.327
- Nah.
- Yes, you are. A little, maybe?

46:21.331 --> 46:23.371
Well, wouldn't you be?

46:23.500 --> 46:27.961
If a big giant man wanted to
beat <i>me</i> up, I'd be real scared.

46:31.842 --> 46:34.926
Well, the truth is, you know, sometimes...

46:36.263 --> 46:39.180
I do get a little scared, you know.

46:39.308 --> 46:42.723
When I'm in that ring
and I'm really gettin' hit on,

46:42.853 --> 46:46.767
and my arms hurt so much I can't
even lift them, and I'm thinkin',

46:46.898 --> 46:52.819
"God! I wish this guy would hit me on
the chin so I don't feel nothin' any more."

46:54.198 --> 46:58.777
Then there's another side that
comes out that isn't so scared.

46:59.078 --> 47:01.534
There's another side that, like,

47:02.790 --> 47:07.287
wants to take more, that wants
to go that one more round,

47:07.420 --> 47:12.580
because by goin' that one more round
when you don't think you can,

47:13.801 --> 47:19.222
that's what makes all the difference
in your life. You know what I mean?

47:20.224 --> 47:23.012
And will you remember one more thing?

47:23.519 --> 47:28.762
Will you remember that... Daddy thinks
you're the best boy in the world, hm?

47:28.900 --> 47:31.984
And that Daddy loves you...
no matter what?

47:32.111 --> 47:34.151
Will you?

47:41.704 --> 47:44.161
I gotta go now.

47:44.291 --> 47:47.209
- You gonna take care of everythin'?
- OK.

47:47.586 --> 47:51.002
And don't forget to feed your robot.

47:52.299 --> 47:54.339
Bye, baby.

47:55.135 --> 47:57.175
Good luck.

47:57.805 --> 47:59.963
Thanks.

48:00.099 --> 48:02.934
Come on! The meter's runnin'!

48:29.878 --> 48:32.832
<i>~ Two worlds collide, rival nations ~</i>

48:34.174 --> 48:39.550
<i>~ It's a primitive clash,</i>

48:39.681 --> 48:43.216
<i>~ Bravely we hope against all hope ~</i>

48:44.269 --> 48:46.308
<i>~ There is so much at stake ~</i>

48:46.438 --> 48:50.305
<i>~ Seems our freedom's</i>

48:51.568 --> 48:53.940
<i>~ Does the crowd understand? ~</i>

48:54.070 --> 48:56.312
<i>~ Is it East versus West ~</i>

48:56.448 --> 48:58.773
<i>~ Or man against man? ~</i>

48:58.908 --> 49:03.321
<i>~ Can any nation stand alone? ~</i>

49:04.289 --> 49:06.661
<i>~ In the burning heart ~</i>

49:06.791 --> 49:08.998
<i>~ Just about to burst ~</i>

49:09.127 --> 49:13.919
<i>~ There's a quest for answers,</i>

49:14.049 --> 49:16.172
<i>~ In the darkest night... ~</i>

49:16.301 --> 49:18.340
What a horrendous flight.

49:18.470 --> 49:21.720
This is Russia?
It don't look so tough, Rock.

49:47.583 --> 49:49.742
Mr Balboa.

49:51.420 --> 49:54.291
We take you to quarters now.

49:54.423 --> 49:58.717
Hey, when does the sun come up?
This is detrimental to my sinuses.

49:59.387 --> 50:02.672
Weather changes, hour to hour.
Get used to it.

50:04.183 --> 50:07.967
Get in car now. We have very long trip.

50:08.104 --> 50:10.559
He sounds like Dracula's cousin.

50:13.484 --> 50:17.149
<i>~ In the warrior's code</i>

50:23.619 --> 50:27.120
<i>~ Deep in our soul a quiet ember ~</i>

50:27.708 --> 50:29.831
<i>~ Knows it's you against you ~</i>

50:30.335 --> 50:34.203
<i>~ It's the paradox that drives us on ~</i>

50:35.465 --> 50:37.707

50:57.988 --> 51:02.733

<i>~ In the burning heart,</i>

51:10.792 --> 51:13.200
Like you requested, yes?

51:13.337 --> 51:16.124
- You requested this dumb location?
- Yeah.

51:16.715 --> 51:20.049
Why? You plannin' to grow
reindeer or somethin'?

51:21.763 --> 51:27.433
- I just wanted to get away from things.
- The equipment you requested is in barn.

51:30.480 --> 51:33.434
- Who are they?
- They?

51:33.566 --> 51:36.353
They are assigned to you.

51:36.486 --> 51:39.155
Official chaperons, yes?

51:39.280 --> 51:41.569
Where you go, they go.

51:42.533 --> 51:44.859
Oh, I have a bad dream here.

51:45.787 --> 51:50.199
- Paul, it's OK.
- OK? This is below human standards.

51:50.333 --> 51:54.746
There's no antennas. You gotta
complain. We'll crack out here!

51:54.879 --> 51:58.213
You have everything
I have been instructed to provide.

51:58.341 --> 52:02.588
We are finished, yes? <i>Da svidaniya.</i>

52:12.563 --> 52:14.604
No sparrin'?

52:17.403 --> 52:20.522
I don't think I need it any more, Paulie.

52:20.656 --> 52:23.064
No sparrin', no TV, nothin'?

52:23.492 --> 52:26.612
How the heck is he supposed
to train around here?

52:27.204 --> 52:29.991
No TV. What about the Rose Bowl game?

52:30.332 --> 52:34.460
No room service, I bet.
I hope they got my comics here.

52:34.586 --> 52:37.078
What a depressing vacation.

52:44.513 --> 52:46.553
Goddamn!

52:50.269 --> 52:54.978
<i>All right, you Chipmunks.</i>
<i>Ready to sing your song?</i>

52:55.107 --> 52:59.057
<i>~ Christmas, Christmastime is here ~</i>

<i>~ We've been good, but we can't last... ~</i>

53:08.747 --> 53:11.416
Checkmate, friend.

53:25.013 --> 53:28.014
- Yeah?
- Hey, champ. Can I come up?

53:28.141 --> 53:30.181
Yeah, sure.

53:32.646 --> 53:34.804
- How you doin'?
- Pretty good.

53:34.940 --> 53:39.186
- Some kinda weather we're havin', huh?
- Yeah, it's pretty rough.

53:39.319 --> 53:41.988
But for what you gotta do, it's good.

53:43.615 --> 53:46.485
- Toughen you up.
- I guess so.

53:46.618 --> 53:51.196
I know you're gonna have to do almost
everything alone, but I'll be with you.

53:51.331 --> 53:53.370
Yeah, I know.

53:53.500 --> 53:56.501
Apollo was like my son.

53:56.628 --> 53:59.166
I raised him.

53:59.297 --> 54:01.872
And when he died... a part of me died.

54:04.053 --> 54:06.805
But now... <i>you're</i> the one.

54:06.931 --> 54:11.260
You're the one that's gonna keep
his spirit alive. You're the one...

54:11.394 --> 54:15.522
that's gonna make sure
that he didn't die for nothing.

54:15.648 --> 54:18.649
Now you're gonna have
to go through hell,

54:18.776 --> 54:21.943
worse than any nightmare
that you ever dreamed.

54:22.238 --> 54:27.196
But in the end...
I know you'll be the one standin'.

54:28.995 --> 54:31.034
I'll try.

54:34.083 --> 54:36.123
I'll try.

54:40.214 --> 54:42.254
You know what you gotta do.

54:44.343 --> 54:46.799
Do it.

54:47.221 --> 54:49.261
Do it!

54:54.604 --> 54:56.644
Thanks, Duke.

59:10.281 --> 59:12.736
I couldn't stay away any more.

59:16.245 --> 59:18.701
I missed you.

59:20.916 --> 59:23.586
I missed <i>you.</i>

59:24.295 --> 59:27.166
I'm with you, no matter what.

59:27.466 --> 59:29.505
No matter what?

59:32.137 --> 59:34.379
No matter what.

No pain. No pain.

Drago!

01:04:00.327 --> 01:04:03.660
Drago!

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:11.126
Drago!

01:04:13.048 --> 01:04:15.965
Hello, and merry Christmas
from a very unusual place.

01:04:16.093 --> 01:04:20.304
We're in Moscow. I'm Barry Tompkins,
along with Al Bandiero,

01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:24.380
and this promises to be the most
watched event in boxing history.

01:04:24.518 --> 01:04:29.678
The Iron Horse from America, Rocky
Balboa, comes here to the Soviet Union...

01:04:31.149 --> 01:04:36.061
Ivan Drago: Since that tragedy in Las
Vegas and the death of Apollo Creed,

01:04:36.196 --> 01:04:39.316
he's been re-nicknamed
"Death from Above".

01:04:50.461 --> 01:04:53.131
Drago! Drago!

01:05:11.232 --> 01:05:15.479
The general secretary of the Soviet
and other members of the Politburo

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:20.570
have now made their way to their seats
high above the ring here in Moscow.

01:05:25.872 --> 01:05:30.581
I know you're kinda busy, but I wanna
tell you some things I never told you.

01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:35.787
I know sometimes I act stupid and I say
stupid things, but you kept me around

01:05:35.923 --> 01:05:40.052
when other people would've said
"Drop that bum." You give me respect.

01:05:40.178 --> 01:05:44.046
It's hard for me to say these kinda
things because that ain't my way,

01:05:44.183 --> 01:05:49.557
but if I could unzip myself and step out
and be someone else, I'd wanna be you.

01:05:49.688 --> 01:05:51.728
You're all heart, Rock.

01:05:54.276 --> 01:05:56.483
Thanks, Paulie.

01:05:56.612 --> 01:05:58.770
Now blast this guy's teeth out!

01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:02.564
I'll try.

01:06:17.466 --> 01:06:22.093
One of the fighters is starting to make his
way through this crowd toward the ring.

01:06:22.221 --> 01:06:26.550
- Listen to this crowd!
- This borders on pure hatred.

01:06:26.684 --> 01:06:31.559
Rocky's face: Absolutely like stone,
a picture of concentration,

01:06:31.689 --> 01:06:34.855
and the booing crowd here does
not seem to bother him one bit.

01:06:34.984 --> 01:06:37.654
The champ has a look that
could burn through lead.

01:06:37.779 --> 01:06:41.563
It seems the booing crowd has
absolutely no effect on the man.

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.776
His concentration is like stone.

01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:46.282
- That's my dad.
- We know.

01:06:46.413 --> 01:06:48.785
What do you think we are - nerds?

01:06:48.915 --> 01:06:51.869
Listen to this crowd. It sounds insane.

01:06:59.467 --> 01:07:03.382
And now the entrance
of the Russian national champion.

01:07:03.513 --> 01:07:08.009
Ivan Drago, a man with
an entire country in his corner.

01:08:00.655 --> 01:08:03.655
Look at the expression
on the face of Ivan Drago.

01:08:03.783 --> 01:08:06.949
He seems impervious
to this madness of the crowd.

01:08:07.078 --> 01:08:09.948
He's like a volcano just waiting to erupt.

01:08:10.081 --> 01:08:14.790
The Russian is cool
as he acknowledges his premier.

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:20.584
I would like to point out again,
this is a non-sanctioned fight.

01:08:20.716 --> 01:08:26.221
This is not for the title. The American
Boxing Commission has not sanctioned it.

01:10:01.319 --> 01:10:03.525
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:10:11.496 --> 01:10:13.205
Rocky Balboa!

01:10:17.753 --> 01:10:22.913
It's unbelievable.
I have never seen such a hostile crowd.

01:10:31.642 --> 01:10:33.516
Ivan Drago!

01:10:43.988 --> 01:10:49.326
Roaring for their champion!
The two men are walking to the centre.

01:10:49.451 --> 01:10:52.488
It's an unbelievable sight to see.

01:10:52.621 --> 01:10:54.661
They're toe to toe.

01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:59.785
The Russian towers above the American.
It's a true case of David and Goliath here.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.788
It's unbelievable, the...
the condition of both men.

01:11:05.009 --> 01:11:07.335
I must break you.

01:11:13.685 --> 01:11:17.184
Remember what I said
about wanting to be you?

01:11:17.314 --> 01:11:19.353
Forget it.

01:11:20.317 --> 01:11:22.356
Thanks, Paul.

01:11:30.535 --> 01:11:34.200
Take it straight to him, and be
a rock for me, you understand?

01:11:34.331 --> 01:11:38.163
Be a rock for me! Be strong!
All right? Take it to him! No pain.

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:41.744
- No pain. No pain.
- No pain. No pain. All right, Rock. Do it!

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:47.835
There's the bell.
Rocky comes to the centre of the ring,

01:11:47.969 --> 01:11:51.919
like the Russian, way back
into Balboa's corner now.

01:11:56.436 --> 01:11:59.770
- Get outta there!
- Let's go, Rocky!

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:08.194
Balboa gets out of the corner, and it is
Drago backing Rocky up with a jab.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:13.828
And Balboa is not staying on balance
because of the long jab of the Russian.

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:16.243
Brace yourself! Brace yourself!

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:23.792
Hands up!

01:12:24.715 --> 01:12:26.459
- Charge him!
- Now!

01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:29.510
He can't seem to touch the Russian.

01:12:29.637 --> 01:12:34.465
Rocky pounding away, and he's just hit
him with everything he's got.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.222
And Drago just smiled at him.

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:42.313
- Keep choppin' away!
- Chop him down! Chop him down!

01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:50.825
Rocky Balboa is in serious trouble!

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:54.071
They might have to stop this one
before somebody gets killed.

01:12:54.204 --> 01:12:57.371
Reach and grab him! Reach and grab him!

01:12:59.751 --> 01:13:03.452
Rocky woke the sleeping giant,
and now he's paying the price!

01:13:03.588 --> 01:13:07.882
A right hand from Drago sends Rocky
Balboa 15 feet across the ring,

01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:10.465
and the champ is down!

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:18.348
Come on! Get up!

01:13:20.731 --> 01:13:22.854
Hands up! Hands up!

01:13:29.406 --> 01:13:34.910
Drago continuing to punish Rocky.
He will not let him out of that corner,

01:13:35.037 --> 01:13:39.615
and Rocky Balboa is just trying to
get through this first round.

01:13:44.129 --> 01:13:48.792
The Russian just threw Rocky Balboa
into his own corner like a rag doll.

01:13:48.926 --> 01:13:51.464
What a tough three minutes
for Rocky Balboa.

01:13:51.596 --> 01:13:54.632
He's not only fighting
an invincible opponent,

01:13:54.766 --> 01:13:57.221
he's also fighting a hostile crowd,

01:13:57.352 --> 01:14:01.729
and the Russian premier and
most of the Politburo looking on.

01:14:01.856 --> 01:14:05.307
- What's happenin' out there?
- He's winnin'.

01:14:06.527 --> 01:14:09.528
- I see three of him out there.
- Hit the one in the middle.

01:14:09.656 --> 01:14:12.740
- Right! Hit the one in the middle!
- Yeah.

01:14:12.867 --> 01:14:15.275
You're not doing as you're told.

01:14:15.745 --> 01:14:18.532
The American is small and weak...

01:14:18.873 --> 01:14:20.248
Weak.

01:14:20.375 --> 01:14:25.500
Take his heart. If you hurt him, you'll
take his heart. No pain! Keep workin'!

01:14:28.007 --> 01:14:30.759
Round two.
It's been a one-sided fight so far.

01:14:30.885 --> 01:14:34.753
It'll take more than luck
for Rocky to survive this round.

01:14:35.014 --> 01:14:37.221
Slip him a hook, Rock! Slip him a hook!

01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:42.428
Balboa trying to stay in the middle
of the ring against the big Russian.

01:14:44.984 --> 01:14:47.688
Do what you gotta do! Stay with him!

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:56.735
For all intent,
Balboa should be all finished,

01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:59.575
but he's fighting back ferociously.

01:15:03.752 --> 01:15:05.792
Rocky!

01:15:06.839 --> 01:15:12.046
Balboa goes down again from
a right hand! Bounces right back up.

01:15:13.012 --> 01:15:15.253
He's gettin' killed out there!

01:15:18.559 --> 01:15:22.259
Rocky Balboa has taken
Ivan Drago's best punches so far.

01:15:22.396 --> 01:15:27.188
He's cut and he's bleeding,
but he's on his feet and he's on the run!

01:15:33.157 --> 01:15:35.945
- He's cut! He's cut!
- The Russian's cut!

01:15:36.077 --> 01:15:41.238
And it's a bad cut! And now it's
Rocky Balboa coming after Ivan Drago!

01:15:51.176 --> 01:15:52.884
Incredible! Get him!

01:15:57.807 --> 01:16:01.223
Drago wants to go on!
He grabs Balboa by the throat!

01:16:01.353 --> 01:16:05.646
Balboa picking up the Russian and throws
him to the ground like a wrestler.

01:16:05.774 --> 01:16:09.771
It's a gutter war!
No holds barred in Moscow!

01:16:09.903 --> 01:16:13.402
Rocky may be on the receiving end
so far, but he's here to fight.

01:16:13.531 --> 01:16:16.568
This is shaping up to be
a personal war, and right now

01:16:16.701 --> 01:16:19.453
it's anybody's boxing match.

01:16:20.872 --> 01:16:24.822
You're doin' good, Rocko.
I couldn't do better myself.

01:16:25.168 --> 01:16:26.366
How can you do this?

01:16:26.503 --> 01:16:28.412
He's nothing... soft!

01:16:28.546 --> 01:16:31.383
You got him hurt bad. Now he's worried.

01:16:31.509 --> 01:16:34.379
You cut him! You hurt him! You see?

01:16:34.512 --> 01:16:37.003
You see? He's not a machine. He's a man!

01:16:37.264 --> 01:16:39.222
He's not human...

01:16:40.893 --> 01:16:43.728
He's like a piece of iron.

01:16:44.689 --> 01:16:48.307
- You want it more than he does! No pain!
- No pain.

01:16:48.442 --> 01:16:51.396
- No pain.
- No pain. OK! Take it to him!

01:16:51.529 --> 01:16:53.237
Take it to him! Take it to him!

01:17:11.507 --> 01:17:12.918
Get up!

01:17:54.301 --> 01:17:57.634
And a big right hand by Rocky Balboa!

01:18:24.207 --> 01:18:27.077
You're doin' fine. You're doin' great.

01:19:31.942 --> 01:19:34.065
Come on!

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:43.579
A few cheers now for Rocky Balboa!

01:19:43.704 --> 01:19:46.621
Suddenly Moscow is pro-Rocky!

01:19:58.761 --> 01:20:00.967
No pain. No pain.

01:20:25.872 --> 01:20:28.078
Al, this place is ready to explode.

01:20:28.208 --> 01:20:32.122
Lethal punch after punch.
Amazing willpower!

01:20:32.253 --> 01:20:37.793
And Rocky's determination is beginning
to win over what was a hostile crowd.

01:20:37.926 --> 01:20:39.206
This is incredible.

01:20:40.178 --> 01:20:43.013
- What round is it?
- 15. One more round.

01:20:43.139 --> 01:20:46.140
There's no stoppin' us now.
This is our round.

01:20:46.267 --> 01:20:48.937
Rocky! Rocky!

01:20:51.439 --> 01:20:53.930
No stoppin' now!
You start and you don't stop!

01:20:54.067 --> 01:20:58.314
All your strength! All your power!
All your love! Everythin' you've got!

01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:02.825
You trained this fool. He's a disgrace.

01:21:03.661 --> 01:21:05.903
Listen to them...

01:21:06.038 --> 01:21:09.288
Our people cheer for HIM! You idiot.

01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:10.751
WIN!

01:21:16.090 --> 01:21:18.129
<i>Nyet!</i>

01:21:19.051 --> 01:21:21.008
I fight to win!

01:21:21.846 --> 01:21:23.044
For me!

01:21:24.765 --> 01:21:26.473
For me!

01:21:28.019 --> 01:21:32.727
To win you gotta knock him out! Punch
and punch till you can't punch no more!

01:21:33.107 --> 01:21:37.436
- This is your whole life here!
- Yeah, knock him out, Rocko.

01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:39.609
Do it now! Now!

01:21:39.739 --> 01:21:45.029
- There's the bell. The war is on.
- This is the last round.

01:21:48.539 --> 01:21:50.413
To the end.

01:21:52.043 --> 01:21:56.456
Which of these magnificent fighters
will be standing at the end?

01:21:56.590 --> 01:22:00.588
Drago snaps out a stiff jab. And another.

01:22:02.846 --> 01:22:07.971
Rocky taking punishment. Trying to get
inside. He's completely exhausted.

01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:11.895
Come on, Rock! What are you waitin' for?!

01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:16.225
Rocky! Rocky!

01:22:19.196 --> 01:22:21.235
Hit him!

01:22:26.912 --> 01:22:29.319
Come on! Fight!

01:22:46.473 --> 01:22:49.261
Balboa is chopping the Russian down!

01:22:50.311 --> 01:22:54.060
Rocky Balboa throwing
punches at the Russian.

01:22:54.190 --> 01:22:58.567
And Drago throws a hard right hand
that stuns Rocky Balboa!

01:23:02.949 --> 01:23:05.487
Don't go down! Don't go down!

01:23:09.664 --> 01:23:15.453
Forget technique, forget strategy.
This is a street fight. Who wants it most?

01:23:15.586 --> 01:23:18.587
- What is he doin'?!
- He's winnin'!

01:23:22.969 --> 01:23:25.424
To the body! To the body!

01:23:31.019 --> 01:23:33.688
Rocko, knock his head off!

01:23:43.282 --> 01:23:45.524
You're gonna do it!

01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:56.832
Ivan!

01:23:59.798 --> 01:24:02.206
Four!

01:24:09.266 --> 01:24:15.020
Rocky Balboa has done the impossible!
And these people love him!

01:24:15.147 --> 01:24:17.555
It is absolute pandemonium!

01:24:17.691 --> 01:24:21.771
More than ever, Rocky has
proven himself a true champion!

01:24:23.113 --> 01:24:25.106
Rocky! Rocky!

01:24:53.269 --> 01:24:55.309
Thank you.

01:25:00.568 --> 01:25:05.029
I came here tonight,
and I didn't know what to expect.

01:25:07.742 --> 01:25:11.028
I seen... a lot of people hatin' me,

01:25:11.162 --> 01:25:14.199
and... I didn't know

01:25:14.332 --> 01:25:19.956
what to feel about that, so... I guess
I didn't like you much none either.

01:25:24.968 --> 01:25:30.390
Durin' this... fight...
I seen a lot of changin'.

01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:37.270
The way... youse felt about me,

01:25:37.857 --> 01:25:40.395
and the way I felt... about you.

01:25:44.530 --> 01:25:47.733
In here, there were two guys...

01:25:49.118 --> 01:25:55.536
killin' each other, but I guess...
that's better than 20 million.

01:25:59.128 --> 01:26:01.619
What I'm tryin' to say is...

01:26:03.924 --> 01:26:05.964
that if I can change...

01:26:08.262 --> 01:26:10.302
and <i>you</i> can change,

01:26:12.475 --> 01:26:14.551
everybody can change!

01:26:31.161 --> 01:26:32.860
Excuse me!

01:26:33.664 --> 01:26:38.622
I just wanna say one thing to my kid,
who should be home sleepin'.

01:26:38.848 --> 01:26:40.663
Merry Christmas, kid!

01:26:42.172 --> 01:26:44.005
I love you!

01:26:54.518 --> 01:26:58.598
