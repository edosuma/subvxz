<b> 1x26 - "Ocean Gem" </b>

00:03.559 --> 00:06.605
- I'm grounded?
- Yes, you're grounded.

00:06.606 --> 00:09.657
- You disobeyed an order.
- Now we're gonna bury you

00:09.658 --> 00:12.276
till you've learned Your lesson.

00:12.277 --> 00:13.801
That's not how grounding works!

00:13.869 --> 00:14.945
Dad?

00:14.946 --> 00:18.417
Uh, you guys better come check this out.

00:18.418 --> 00:19.440
<i>W-W-Wha?</i>

00:19.508 --> 00:22.610
<i>- Wait.
- What the ...</i>

00:22.711 --> 00:25.073
<i>- Where did it go?
- Whoa!</i>

00:25.492 --> 00:27.569
- The ocean!
- Huh?

00:27.604 --> 00:30.585
<i>Hey, it's those magical ladies!</i>

00:30.652 --> 00:34.789
- What's going on here?
- The ocean is gone, obviously.

00:34.824 --> 00:37.469
<i>That's right. Now it's just a desert.</i>

00:37.554 --> 00:41.840
<i>No one wants to take a
vacation to ... Desert City!</i>

00:41.925 --> 00:46.228
Aw, we're gonna lose
all our summer business!

00:46.262 --> 00:51.099
- And all the beach babes. Aw!
- Who's gonna buy my fries?

00:51.184 --> 00:54.937
- And my pizza!
- Who's gonna have fun at funland?

00:54.972 --> 00:58.449
<i>As mayor, I demand you
explain this immediately... !</i>

00:58.450 --> 01:00.442
It was Lapis Lazuli.

01:00.493 --> 01:04.078
- Lapis Lazuli?
- She's the gem you

01:04.113 --> 01:06.949
released from the mirror.

01:07.033 --> 01:09.034
- That's incredible.
- How did you do that?

01:09.118 --> 01:11.003
But she's a gem, just like us.

01:11.087 --> 01:14.957
<i>There's a lot you
don't know about gems, Steven.</i>

01:15.008 --> 01:18.630
<i>How could I have known the
gem contained in that mirror</i>

01:18.631 --> 01:21.997
- would Be so powerful?
- Where are you going, Steven?

01:22.065 --> 01:24.633
I'm leaving to
fix what I did to our home.

01:24.701 --> 01:27.202
I was the one who set
Lapis free from the mirror.

01:27.270 --> 01:29.204
<i>Now it's my fault the ocean's gone.</i>

01:29.272 --> 01:33.475
I'm gonna bring the ocean back
or get really thirsty trying.

01:33.543 --> 01:36.311
Wait up, kiddo.
I'm coming with you.

01:36.379 --> 01:40.315
I want to help, too.
Also, I feel weird being in your

01:40.383 --> 01:43.051
house if you're not here.

01:44.988 --> 01:47.393
Clearly, we're coming, too.

01:47.428 --> 01:48.957
You're
ungrounded, by the way.

01:49.025 --> 01:52.227
Whoo-hoo!
Road trip!

02:02.639 --> 02:03.795
How about some tunes?

02:03.796 --> 02:06.425
This was one of Rose's favorites.

02:06.509 --> 02:09.311
What do you think, Garnet?

02:33.703 --> 02:36.004
I can't believe
Lapis would do this.

02:36.089 --> 02:39.374
- Gems shouldn't fight each other.
- We're always

02:39.425 --> 02:41.176
fighting gems, actually.

02:41.210 --> 02:44.129
- What?!
- Oh, how do I put this?

02:44.213 --> 02:48.028
All gems aren't necessarily ... good.

02:48.063 --> 02:50.552
All those monsters
we fight used to be just like us!

02:50.603 --> 02:52.137
- Right, Pearl?
- Yes.

02:52.221 --> 02:54.389
But they've become corrupted and broken.

02:54.524 --> 02:58.627
<i>We have to take care of them,
subdue them, contain them.</i>

02:58.711 --> 03:01.229
<i>It's the best we can
do for them for now.</i>

03:01.280 --> 03:03.982
<i>If we don't, then ...</i>

03:09.622 --> 03:12.958
That's some magical
destiny stuff, right there.

03:13.042 --> 03:17.220
Guys, I just had the best
idea for an album cover.

03:18.047 --> 03:21.149
This is it.
Lapis Lazuli is here.

03:21.184 --> 03:23.385
I don't understand.
What does she want

03:23.419 --> 03:26.588
- with the ocean?
- Whoa. Look at all this.

03:26.639 --> 03:29.057
It's ... it's just
like a giant aquarium.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.927
<i>You shouldn't be here!</i>

03:31.978 --> 03:37.472
- She sensed us.
- Lapis Lazuli, it's me, Steven!

03:39.936 --> 03:43.905
<i>- Go away before I make you.
- But we're</i>

03:43.940 --> 03:48.443
- beach-summer-fun buddies!
- N-o-o-o-o-o!

03:48.494 --> 03:50.996
<i>You're one of them ... </i>

03:51.080 --> 03:53.081
<i>one of the crystal gems.</i>

03:53.116 --> 03:55.417
- Easy.
- What do you mean?

03:55.485 --> 03:59.087
We're all gems, right?
Just let us help you.

03:59.155 --> 04:02.157
<i>You don't understand.
Just leave me alone.</i>

04:02.225 --> 04:04.233
We're not leaving, Lapis ...

04:04.234 --> 04:08.949
not until you give us
back our ocean!

04:09.465 --> 04:12.467
<i>I said, "leave me alone!" </i>

04:17.140 --> 04:19.474
Greg, kids, you stay behind us.

04:19.524 --> 04:22.944
- We'll handle this.
- Sounds good to me.

04:30.653 --> 04:33.121
- Ruh-oh.
- Stand together.

04:33.156 --> 04:35.157
Don't let them separate us.

04:35.241 --> 04:38.960
Garnet!

05:16.365 --> 05:18.950
Aw, come on!

05:21.037 --> 05:26.174
<i>Well, as long as we're playing fair ...</i>

05:38.221 --> 05:44.226
I hate fighting me.

05:44.277 --> 05:48.563
- Come on, lion!
- You can take me!

05:48.614 --> 05:51.533
- Oh, no, not the van!
- Revenge!

05:51.567 --> 05:55.403
Revenge!

06:00.543 --> 06:04.329
Kids!

06:08.918 --> 06:11.253
- Connie?
- Is this a normal magical

06:11.387 --> 06:13.388
mission for you?
'Cause I'm not so sure how

06:13.422 --> 06:15.890
comfortable I am with you
going on these anymo-o-o-re!

06:15.941 --> 06:18.388
Dad!

06:20.513 --> 06:23.265
Dad! Dad!
Are you okay?

06:23.399 --> 06:26.318
Oh, I think my leg's broken.

06:26.402 --> 06:31.489
See? This is why we
wear seatbelts, kids.

06:33.609 --> 06:37.829
Lapis, I don't
want to fight anymore.

06:37.914 --> 06:45.120
I said, "I don't want to fight"!

06:49.091 --> 06:51.293
Hmm? Mm.

06:56.966 --> 07:00.902
- Steven?
- Lapis, I'm coming up

07:00.970 --> 07:03.505
to see you.
So please don't drown me.

07:03.573 --> 07:08.476
Wait, Steven!

07:23.125 --> 07:29.297
- Lapis?
- What are you doing here, Steven?

07:29.398 --> 07:33.335
What? I ... no!
What are you doing here?

07:33.419 --> 07:38.340
This thing, the ocean,
this is crazy.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.509
Can't we work this out?
We gems should be friends.

07:41.594 --> 07:45.394
<i>- Whoa!
- Don't you know anything, Steven? </i>

07:45.429 --> 07:48.342
Your friends, they don't really
care about other gems.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.816
All they care about is the Earth.

07:50.817 --> 07:56.102
But I never believed in this place.

08:00.891 --> 08:03.081
What?

08:06.369 --> 08:11.289
- I just wanna go home.
- I know how important

08:11.374 --> 08:13.875
home can be.
But that's why I'm here.

08:13.959 --> 08:17.408
You took the ocean away,
and the ocean is an important

08:17.422 --> 08:19.631
- part of my home.
- I'm only using the ocean

08:19.715 --> 08:23.184
because my gem is cracked.
If I just stretch it

08:23.219 --> 08:25.887
far enough ...

08:25.938 --> 08:30.642
This is never going to work.

08:30.726 --> 08:33.833
I can fix your gem!
I have healing powers!

08:33.869 --> 08:36.438
Wait, you have healing powers?

08:36.474 --> 08:40.101
- I know, right?
- Oh, what should I ...

08:40.169 --> 08:44.472
Oh, uh, sorry.
This might be a little weird.

08:44.540 --> 08:48.293
What?

09:03.142 --> 09:08.930
- Thank you, Steven.
- No prob, bob.

09:08.998 --> 09:13.134
- It's Lapis.
- Yeah.

09:13.202 --> 09:19.441
- Okay. Bye.
- Oh!

09:27.583 --> 09:29.951
The whole
tower's coming down.

09:30.035 --> 09:35.173
What about Steven?

09:35.257 --> 09:40.044
- Whoa...!
- Grab my hand!

09:42.298 --> 09:44.165
Gotcha.

09:46.268 --> 09:49.499
Steven!

09:54.479 --> 09:55.873
Huh?

09:57.213 --> 10:02.150
Yes! Babe city,
here we come! Whoa!

10:09.325 --> 10:11.993
That's how you do it.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.085
Well, what's that
thing you always say about the

10:21.170 --> 10:24.923
- pork chops and the hot dogs?
- Look!

10:30.012 --> 10:35.150
Mm.

10:35.684 --> 10:40.183
- So, Lapis made it off planet.
- What does this mean for us?

10:40.218 --> 10:43.274
We wait and see.
