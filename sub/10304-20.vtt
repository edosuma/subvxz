01:57.320 --> 01:59.709
The great thing about your mother
being out of town...

01:59.920 --> 02:02.673
...aside from the fact
that she's not here...

02:04.360 --> 02:06.920
...is the three of us
get a chance to bond.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.231
Dad, as long as we're bonding...

02:10.479 --> 02:13.153
...you know, l'm going to be graduating
from college soon...

02:13.400 --> 02:16.915
-...and l got some pretty serious life--
-Bud, shut up.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.153
Family Matters is on now.

02:19.360 --> 02:22.955
lf you got anything to learn about life
you can learn it from Urkel...

02:23.320 --> 02:25.880
...and his fat cop neighbour.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.279
l hate this show.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.198
How could you not love Urkel?

02:30.440 --> 02:34.672
l mean, with his glasses
and those pants and the suspenders.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.829
Speaking of annoying neighbour boys
in suspenders....

02:46.160 --> 02:49.948
Everyone, l have great news
that you will all want to hear--

02:50.200 --> 02:54.113
Marcie got a promotion at the bank that
will take her to Japan once a month.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.836
Jefferson, you stole my thunder.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.949
Oh, l'm sorry, dear.
lt won't happen again.

03:01.200 --> 03:04.033
-Okay. l--
-She's gonna be vice president.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.910
Vice president in charge
of all transactions...

03:07.120 --> 03:09.475
...between her branch
and the home office in Japan.

03:09.720 --> 03:12.075
-Are you finished?
-Almost.

03:12.600 --> 03:16.912
With her salary increase, she'll never
have to worry about money again.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.759
Well, you will if you don't shut up.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.316
Guys, l'm just so happy
for both of you.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.318
What say we celebrate
by you getting the hell out of here...

03:26.520 --> 03:28.795
...and me watching my TV.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.032
My treat.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.078
Technically, l don't have the job yet.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.515
So celebrating
would be a bit premature.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.672
You see, the bank president
is flying all the way from Japan...

03:43.880 --> 03:45.632
...to have dinner at my house tonight.

03:45.840 --> 03:49.549
Now, once he approves of me,
the job is as good as mine.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.758
Oh, l love this show. That Urkel...

03:53.560 --> 03:54.834
...what an actor.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.309
See, Bud, l'm not alone.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.833
No, as long as there's a sailor
and an ice-cream cone...

04:02.040 --> 04:03.792
...you'll never be alone.

04:07.720 --> 04:12.271
So, Al, the reason that l'm here
is that l need your help...

04:12.520 --> 04:17.149
...with just one little thing
to make tonight's dinner perfect.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.994
l need you to leave
the neighbourhood.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.678
You see, l don't want my boss
to be repulsed by you...

04:23.880 --> 04:25.871
...and your children. No offence.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.072
None taken.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.118
So you'll do it?

04:31.320 --> 04:34.232
l meant none taken...

04:34.440 --> 04:35.793
...yet.

04:37.480 --> 04:40.950
All right, Al. What's your price?

04:41.200 --> 04:44.556
One night, all expenses paid...

04:44.800 --> 04:48.076
...in a Howard Boman's Motor Lodge.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.834
Oh, Hobo's.

04:51.800 --> 04:55.395
Where every bed
is shaped like a boxcar.

05:01.720 --> 05:06.475
Or so l hear from my slutty friends
who go there all the time.

05:07.960 --> 05:09.552
Not me.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.552
We also want passes...

05:11.760 --> 05:17.232
...to the Hobo's
Friday's all-you-can-eat clam buffet.

05:21.800 --> 05:27.511
Well, Al, you drive a hard bargain
and a rusty Dodge.

05:28.280 --> 05:32.637
But l think l can spring
for 5 more dollars. Live it up.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.878
So, Mr. Shimokawa,
did you like the sushi?

05:49.720 --> 05:51.392
lt was wonderful. Thank you.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.279
How original, serving sushi
to a Japanese man in America.

06:01.360 --> 06:06.275
It's lik e Gilligan getting off the island
and being offered a coconut.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.072
You know...

06:12.320 --> 06:15.915
...l find the Japanese culture
to be fascinating.

06:16.160 --> 06:20.915
l mean, the art, the literature.
l just loved The Joy Luck Club.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.432
That was Chinese.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.511
Well, the Kamasutra.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.872
That is lndian.

06:31.440 --> 06:37.595
In my country, this man would
be filling water glasses at Denny's.

06:38.680 --> 06:42.992
So now that we've finished with dinner,
can l offer you some--?

06:43.240 --> 06:45.549
Let me guess. Tea.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.313
--tea?

06:48.480 --> 06:52.359
Would you like something in it?
Milk? Sugar?

06:53.160 --> 06:54.912
Whisk ey.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.431
Now, who could that be?

07:00.640 --> 07:05.111
Please let it be Domino's.
I'd kill for a pizza.

07:07.240 --> 07:11.791
Look, honey, it's our favourite
neighbours: the Bundys.

07:12.040 --> 07:17.068
Kelly, Bud, Peggy, Al.

07:20.240 --> 07:24.631
Mr. Shimokawa, this is Al Bundy,
an Acura salesman.

07:26.360 --> 07:29.557
Peggy, his wife, a homemaker.

07:29.800 --> 07:33.270
Their son, Bud,
who's home from medical school...

07:33.560 --> 07:37.473
...and their daughter, Kelly,
who's a violin prodigy.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.077
This isn't too patronizing.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.709
l just wanted to thank you again,
Marcie san...

07:43.960 --> 07:47.157
...for the home loan you got for us.

07:47.400 --> 07:51.632
She is truly the Japanese
businessman's best friend.

07:51.880 --> 07:56.032
Well, thanks, Bundys, for stopping by.

08:06.640 --> 08:11.077
Mrs. D'Arcy, l had a wonderful time,
but l must really be going.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.515
To a liquor store.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.830
Oh, no, no, no. No, you can't go yet.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.634
The best is just ahead.

08:20.080 --> 08:24.471
Oh, good.
They're going to hang themselves.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.280
Karaoke.

08:28.200 --> 08:31.909
Oh, no. I'm going to hang myself.

08:57.280 --> 09:00.238
If only I could forget.

09:01.440 --> 09:04.750
The job is mine. I can feel it.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.558
What was that?

09:12.760 --> 09:15.752
-Nothing.
-No, that was not nothing.

09:15.960 --> 09:20.317
That was a 1 97 1 Dodge.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.480
The one l need
to complete my collection.

09:23.720 --> 09:27.030
Oh, you collect
classic American cars?

09:27.280 --> 09:30.750
No, l collect classic American junk.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.909
Yes, l have a Gremlin and a Pacer...

09:35.160 --> 09:39.233
...an old yellow school bus
with no brakes or no seat belts.

09:39.480 --> 09:43.029
l have everything except that one.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.635
That is real junk.

09:49.880 --> 09:54.237
Mrs. D'Arcy, the car's
very important to me. l must have it.

09:54.480 --> 09:58.632
Well, don't you worry, Mr. Shimokawa,
l'll take care of everything...

09:58.880 --> 10:03.351
...and l'll even leave my Jefferson here
to entertain you.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.437
Clam me, Bud.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.159
Hey.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.708
Here are the rest of the Hobo's clams
from the trunk.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.153
The corn's keeping warm
in the muffler.

10:37.960 --> 10:41.350
What are you people doing here?
l bought you a room.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.477
They kicked us out.

10:44.640 --> 10:48.189
And l have a good mind to sue them
for false advertising.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.955
That sign clearly said
''all the clams you could eat'' ...

10:52.200 --> 10:55.317
...not ''all the clams you can eat
right now.''

10:56.680 --> 10:58.398
So how are things going
with your boss?

10:58.640 --> 11:03.714
Oh, great, great. Just great.
Until you three Mothra'd on home.

11:03.920 --> 11:09.552
As it turns out Mr. Shimokawa collects
junk cars and he wants to buy yours.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.758
l don't have any junk cars.
All l have is the Dodge.

11:14.360 --> 11:18.114
-You don't mean--
-Oh, come on, Al.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.268
He'll probably offer you
twice what it's worth.

11:21.520 --> 11:24.592
l mean, you might even get $50.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.636
Well, Marcie, me and that Dodge
have been together a long time.

11:28.880 --> 11:32.475
Well, so have you and your hair,
but you got rid of that.

11:34.840 --> 11:37.149
Way to bargain, Marce.

11:37.360 --> 11:40.352
l love that car
more than anything that l have.

11:44.480 --> 11:47.916
Dad, what about us?

11:48.480 --> 11:50.596
You need a Q-Tip?

11:58.440 --> 12:00.874
Marcie, like l said before,
l'm not selling that car.

12:01.840 --> 12:04.912
Especially not to some Japanese
bigwig...

12:05.160 --> 12:07.116
...who gets rich by flooding
our market...

12:07.360 --> 12:09.510
...with fuel-efficient affordable cars...

12:09.760 --> 12:13.275
...that don't fold up
like a tin can on a front-end collision.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.748
Like that's important.

12:14.960 --> 12:18.714
And all the while they're buying up
all our American classics.

12:19.440 --> 12:23.319
Please, Al, my job is on the line.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.914
Oh, well, that changes nothing.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.112
l'm not selling that car to your boss.

12:32.320 --> 12:35.039
That car was born a Bundy.
By God, it will die a Bundy.

13:01.040 --> 13:04.112
More than life itself.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.631
Mrs. D'Arcy.
So did you get my Dodge?

13:14.880 --> 13:19.032
You know, his price was too high.
lsn't that just like the poor?

13:19.240 --> 13:22.038
Always trying
to take advantage of the rich.

13:22.280 --> 13:25.795
God, l hate them.
So l tell you what we're going to do.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.389
Tomorrow, l'm gonna take you
down to a dealership...

13:28.600 --> 13:30.556
...and we're going to get you
a better one.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.357
Do you not realize
how rare those Dodges are today?

13:35.600 --> 13:38.194
l mean, half of them were recalled.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.351
The other half dissolved in the rain.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.949
This may be the only one left.

13:45.200 --> 13:49.273
Well, Mr. Shimokawa,
l just don't think he wants to sell.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.431
Bottom line, Mrs. D'Arcy,
you will get me that Dodge...

13:54.680 --> 13:57.513
...or l will get me
a new vice president for my bank.

14:10.280 --> 14:13.989
So, Al, to thank you for being
so understanding about my boss...

14:14.240 --> 14:17.630
...l thought it only right
to treat you to dinner and a show.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.834
Mrs. D'Arcy, l thought, as a feminist,
you wouldn't like places like this.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.593
Oh, no, no, no.

14:30.840 --> 14:34.753
Feminism is about protecting
a woman's rights in the workplace.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.151
Now, where that workplace
happens to be is none of my concern.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.277
Lap dance?

14:43.960 --> 14:46.076
Split, bitch.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.310
So, Al, let's talk about your future.

14:50.560 --> 14:55.076
Sure, you're making
tens of dollars now...

14:55.920 --> 14:58.229
...but you can't work forever.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.392
And somehow l seriously doubt...

15:01.640 --> 15:04.791
...that your children
will be there to support you.

15:09.320 --> 15:12.596
Move into my parents' basement
with me, babe.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.831
We'll live on love.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.840
Well, that and welfare.

15:20.440 --> 15:24.194
So it occurs to me
that you could use a nest egg.

15:24.440 --> 15:29.719
Say, somewhere
in the neighbourhood of $3000?

15:29.960 --> 15:33.316
-Marcie, the car's not for sale.
-Oh, come on, Al.

15:33.560 --> 15:36.028
You know that car's not worth $3000.

15:36.240 --> 15:40.472
Why are you being such an ass--
Astoundingly stubborn human?

15:41.960 --> 15:45.032
Marcie, see. lt's a-- lt's a man's thing.

15:45.280 --> 15:51.628
Unlike you leg-shavers, we men--
We men like our things broken in.

15:51.880 --> 15:57.750
You know, old things.
Old tennis shoes, old filthy jeans.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.834
A 30-year-old toothbrush
with chunkets of Reggie bar in them.

16:03.640 --> 16:06.518
See, now, the Dodge is like that.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.556
Dodge is just like that.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.553
Over the years, l moulded that car...

16:12.760 --> 16:16.469
...to fit every nook and cranny
of my body.

16:16.720 --> 16:19.473
And l tell you the truth,
l don't have the life left over...

16:19.680 --> 16:22.990
...to break in another car.
So my answer still must be:

16:29.800 --> 16:31.597
What was l saying?

16:32.520 --> 16:35.956
Never mind. You, Al Bundy, are a pig.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.912
l repeat, a pig.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.196
We're leaving. Jefferson?

16:48.960 --> 16:51.679
-Jefferson, we're going home.
-Why? What's wrong?

16:51.920 --> 16:54.832
Because l can't stand another minute
in this hideous, horrible--

16:55.080 --> 16:57.594
Oh, Mr. Shimokawa.

16:58.360 --> 17:00.555
What brings you to the Jiggly Room?

17:00.800 --> 17:03.473
Quite honestly, the jiggly.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.675
So, Mrs. D'Arcy,
did you secure my Dodge?

17:09.880 --> 17:12.314
Well, yes-- Well, no.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.436
Actually, l'm still negotiating.

17:14.680 --> 17:18.593
You see, my husband
wasn't feeling very well, and--

17:25.720 --> 17:28.473
How can l trust you
to negotiate banking deals...

17:28.720 --> 17:33.953
...when you can't even buy a rusting
hunk from a rusting shoe salesman?

17:34.200 --> 17:39.035
l can see everything
with my x-ray onion eyeglasses.

17:42.280 --> 17:45.317
Please, Mr. Shimokawa,
give me another chance.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.596
l will find his price.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.913
Five thousand dollars.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.798
No.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.634
Seventy-five hundred.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.677
No.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.798
-Ten thousand?
-No.

18:25.040 --> 18:29.477
Hello, Officer Dan.
What can l do for you?

18:29.720 --> 18:32.473
We got a call
about an indecent sex act.

18:33.040 --> 18:38.160
l assure you l have no indecent sex act
in my establishment.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.510
Then get one.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.516
We didn't ditch that drug stakeout
for nothing.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.194
Al, l don't understand you.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.273
You have turned down $1 0,000.

18:58.480 --> 19:00.630
Now, that is more money
than you would make...

19:00.840 --> 19:04.116
...if you live to be 1 0,000.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.831
Marcie, it's not the money,
it's the sentiment.

19:08.080 --> 19:12.676
All right,
what is the sentimental value?

19:12.920 --> 19:15.559
-Twenty thousand.
-Twenty thousand?

19:15.800 --> 19:18.519
-That is ridiculous--
-My car.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.592
All right. l'll ask.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.309
Don't you think $20,000
is a little much to ask...

19:35.560 --> 19:38.552
...for a car that's made
mostly of string and paper?

19:39.240 --> 19:42.550
Son, l've got Marcie
exactly where l want her.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.948
Dad, at the risk
of sugarcoating this...

19:46.200 --> 19:49.670
...l'll just say that when it comes
to finances, you're an idiot.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.275
All right. All right.
You got your 20 grand.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.592
Daddy.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.476
-Do we have a deal?
-Yes...

20:01.720 --> 20:03.233
...on one condition.

20:07.600 --> 20:11.752
Well, Mr. Shimokawa,
you got yourself a car.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.517
l told Mrs. D'Arcy every man
has his price.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.911
We do.
Just like every woman has hers.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.038
Well, good news, Mr. Shimokawa.
You got your car.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.555
And the job is yours, Mrs. D'Arcy.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.356
Because of my great
negotiating skills?

20:45.600 --> 20:49.479
No, because you know
how to shake it, baby.

20:51.760 --> 20:57.232
Well, in that case,
consider this my resignation.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.272
lsn't this nice?

21:17.520 --> 21:20.034
Quiet evening alone
with my loved ones.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.555
Oh, Daddy, that's so sweet.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.475
Oh, don't gush it up.
He's talking about his clams.

21:29.320 --> 21:32.153
In other news, the president
of the largest bank in Japan...

21:32.400 --> 21:37.520
... was arrested yesterday for starting
a riot in a Chicago nudie bar.

21:40.520 --> 21:44.433
At least Mrs. D'Arcy didn't get demoted
to drive-up teller this time.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.672
Yeah, but now she's the ATM beeper.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.513
What's that?

21:50.760 --> 21:53.479
You know when you punch
in your code and it goes...?

21:53.720 --> 21:56.393
-Yeah?
-Yeah, that's her.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.600
Daddy, l'm sorry
you didn't get your money for your car.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.995
-l got my clams.
-Yeah.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.235
Dig in.

22:06.720 --> 22:12.158
In other news, a rare strain of botulism
was discovered and traced back...

22:12.360 --> 22:17.275
... to the all-you-can-eat clam night
at the Chicago's Hobo's Motor Lodge.

22:17.520 --> 22:20.080
Fortunately, most of the tainted
shellfish was stolen...

22:20.280 --> 22:24.592
...by a family of homeless thieves
living in a Dodge.
