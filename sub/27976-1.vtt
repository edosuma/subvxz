Now that I'm letting you
come down here and play,

00:27.818 --> 00:29.850
guess who else gets to
come down here and play?

00:29.852 --> 00:31.389
Who?

00:36.059 --> 00:37.859
<i>Your sister.</i>

00:43.267 --> 00:44.834
<i>Your sister.</i>

00:44.836 --> 00:46.335
What?

00:46.337 --> 00:47.935
Well, things sure have
a way of working out smoothly.

00:47.937 --> 00:49.036
Am I right, guys?

00:49.038 --> 00:51.039
What?

00:55.712 --> 00:58.347
We are from the planet Duplo,

00:58.349 --> 01:01.852
and we are here
to destroy you.

01:02.419 --> 01:03.719
Oh, man!

01:03.721 --> 01:05.519
You're going to have to
get past us.

01:05.522 --> 01:07.422
- Specifically me.
- Oh, it's on!

01:07.424 --> 01:08.991
Yar!

01:08.993 --> 01:12.961
Wait, guys.
There's no need to fight anymore.

01:12.963 --> 01:14.128
I got this.

01:14.130 --> 01:17.633
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:17.635 --> 01:20.969
Here we go.

01:20.971 --> 01:24.740
<i>Hello,
visitors from another planet.</i>

01:24.742 --> 01:27.609
You are just as special

01:27.611 --> 01:29.913

01:33.918 --> 01:36.250
See? Friends.

01:36.252 --> 01:37.886
Ooh!

01:37.888 --> 01:39.654
Yes.

01:39.656 --> 01:41.357
What do you know? It worked.

01:41.359 --> 01:42.890
Even though we're different,

01:42.892 --> 01:45.193
I guess if we open our hearts
everything can be...

01:52.636 --> 01:54.301
More!

01:54.303 --> 01:56.404
- More!
- More!

01:56.406 --> 02:00.175

02:00.177 --> 02:01.276
Oh, no!

02:01.278 --> 02:02.980

President Business,
you have to stay and help us!

it out amongst yourselves.

03:00.338 --> 03:03.272
You're great at that stuff.
Bye. Gotta go.

03:41.244 --> 03:43.344
He's off having a separate
standalone adventure.

03:43.346 --> 03:44.679
You almost forgot me, guys.

03:44.681 --> 03:46.046
Oh, did we?

04:17.947 --> 04:22.149
<i>A lifetime has
passed since then. We grew up.</i>

04:22.151 --> 04:26.990
<i>Abandoned anything cute,
shiny, poppy, or young.</i>

04:28.457 --> 04:31.125
<i>And from the wreckage,
we built a grittier,</i>

04:31.127 --> 04:33.861
<i>cooler, more mature society.</i>

04:33.863 --> 04:36.964
<i>We call it Apocalypseburg.</i>

04:36.966 --> 04:40.370
<i>And it is
a heckish place to live.</i>

04:42.038 --> 04:43.671

Good, really good.
Saved the world. Again.

06:07.024 --> 06:09.123
Learned the value
of friendship.

06:09.125 --> 06:11.525
I loved. I lost,
and I'm good with it...

06:11.527 --> 06:14.662
And it's totally on brand for me
to be a loner with a broken heart.

06:14.664 --> 06:16.931
It's what the fans want.

06:16.933 --> 06:18.933
So, yeah,
no, I'm good with it.

06:18.935 --> 06:21.135
Just me and Alfred.

06:21.137 --> 06:23.837
Not a terse laugh.

06:23.839 --> 06:25.974

- Oh! Hi.

06:51.834 --> 06:53.467
I brought you coffee!

06:53.469 --> 06:54.669
Coffee!

06:54.671 --> 06:56.104
The bitter liquid
that provides

06:56.106 --> 06:57.438
the only semblance of pleasure

06:57.440 --> 06:59.108
left in these dark times.

06:59.110 --> 07:01.642
Oh, my goshness!
Did I interrupt you brooding just now?

07:01.644 --> 07:04.378
Ah, this brooding sesh
is not really going anywhere.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.248
Man, I wish I could
brood like you.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.183
Look, all you gotta do is just
stare off into the distance

07:08.185 --> 07:12.020
and then narrate whatever grim
thoughts come into your mind.

07:12.022 --> 07:15.856
What if one day
there was no coffee?

07:15.858 --> 07:18.859
More like,
"War hardens the heart."

07:18.861 --> 07:20.561
"War hardens our hearts..."

07:20.563 --> 07:22.697
Okay, I'm thinking,
it's more like, "War..."

07:22.699 --> 07:24.032
- "War!"
- Hang on.

07:24.034 --> 07:26.902
- "War." No. "War."
- "War!"

07:26.904 --> 07:28.003
- "War!"
- "War."

07:28.005 --> 07:29.703
"War." I can't do this!

07:29.705 --> 07:31.005
I'm too happy to see you.

07:31.007 --> 07:32.806
What's the scariest thing
you can think of?

07:32.808 --> 07:34.474
Oh, come to think of it,
I actually had a nightmare last night.

07:34.476 --> 07:36.445
Nightmares are super broody.
What was it about?

07:36.447 --> 07:38.680
All right, um, so it started
with this dolphin in a top hat.

07:38.682 --> 07:40.048
Uh-huh.

07:40.050 --> 07:41.916
And the dolphin says
in a weird voice...

07:41.918 --> 07:44.118
It's 5:15 p.m.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.087
Oh, I forgot to mention
his chest was a clock.

07:46.089 --> 07:48.688
Okay, I'm thinkin' darker,
broodier, less fish.

07:48.690 --> 07:51.125
Oh, and Batman was there,
and he was covered in glitter.

07:51.127 --> 07:52.394
<i>There was a talking
ice cream cone.</i>

07:52.396 --> 07:54.296
This isn't really
the broodiest.

07:54.298 --> 07:56.964
And then, these scary black
holes open up in the ground.

07:56.966 --> 08:02.503
They started to suck everybody I've
ever cared about out of my life!

08:02.505 --> 08:04.806
<i>And Gandalf was there.
And he shouted...</i>

08:04.808 --> 08:07.976
It's Armamageddon!

08:07.978 --> 08:09.277
Emmet!

08:09.279 --> 08:10.344
No!

08:10.346 --> 08:13.548
And you disappeared
into the void,

08:13.550 --> 08:16.017
never to be seen again.

08:16.019 --> 08:17.585
Not bad brooding!

08:17.587 --> 08:18.952
Oh! Thanks!

08:18.954 --> 08:20.322
That was definitely
just a dream, right?

08:20.324 --> 08:23.024
Not some vision of the future?

08:23.026 --> 08:26.294
No, no, no.
This is my vision of the future.

08:26.296 --> 08:28.898
A little lower, to the left.

08:29.933 --> 08:31.334
Ta-da!

08:31.868 --> 08:33.134
A house?

08:33.135 --> 08:34.369
Come on! Let me
give you the tour.

08:34.371 --> 08:36.874
Very first one
on the cul-de-sac.

08:38.506 --> 08:41.044
This is the living room,
where you can live it up.

08:41.844 --> 08:43.245
TV room, dining room,

08:43.246 --> 08:45.514
Planty's room,
kitty cat room...

08:45.516 --> 08:47.148
Of course, the kitchen,

08:47.150 --> 08:49.951
complete with breakfast nook,
lunchtime nook, and fireman pole.

08:49.953 --> 08:52.721
Which leads to water slide...

08:52.723 --> 08:54.355
Trampoline room...

08:54.357 --> 08:57.891
Monkey-barring
all the way up to...

08:57.893 --> 08:59.626
Toaster room!

08:59.628 --> 09:03.063
So you can have toast
or waffles at any time!

09:03.065 --> 09:04.466
Oh!

09:04.468 --> 09:06.467
And out back,
a double-decker porch swing,

09:06.469 --> 09:09.069
so we can always
hang together!

09:09.071 --> 09:10.404
What do you think?

09:10.406 --> 09:13.074
Uh... Wow. Um...

09:13.076 --> 09:14.241
It's sweet.

09:14.243 --> 09:16.209
It is. It's just, uh...

09:16.211 --> 09:19.880
It's going to attract aliens
and get destroyed.

09:19.882 --> 09:21.515
But maybe it won't.

09:21.517 --> 09:24.084
I just thought
we could rebuild the future.

09:24.086 --> 09:26.355
Make everything awesome again.

09:26.357 --> 09:27.588
Emmet...

09:27.590 --> 09:29.890
You gotta stop pretending
everything is awesome.

09:29.892 --> 09:31.193
It isn't.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.861
Every morning,
you walk through town,

09:32.863 --> 09:35.763
singing that terrible,
annoying, manufactured pop song!

09:35.765 --> 09:38.231
That song
really seems to upset you.

09:38.233 --> 09:40.334
- No, it doesn't.
- Oh, my mistake.

09:40.336 --> 09:43.303
That song was fine
when we were younger,

09:43.305 --> 09:46.908
but we also have to
grow up sometime.

09:46.910 --> 09:48.344
Can you do that for me?

09:49.211 --> 09:52.914
Well, yeah. I can try.

09:52.916 --> 09:57.052
But it's easy for you.
You were always a dark, goth rebel.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.385
Yes, of course I was.

09:58.387 --> 10:00.020
- Let's change the subject.
- Okay.

10:00.022 --> 10:03.257
We have to be hardened and battle-ready.
Both of us.

10:03.259 --> 10:04.824
Yeah. No, I get it.

10:04.826 --> 10:07.462
And that's why I've cultivated
a totally hard-edged side

10:07.464 --> 10:09.563
that's super tough
and... Look, look!

10:09.565 --> 10:12.302
A shooting star.
Make a wish!

10:13.770 --> 10:15.169
Oh, no!

10:15.171 --> 10:16.470
What? Can't think of anything
to wish for?

10:16.472 --> 10:17.938
I always just wish
for more wishes,

10:17.940 --> 10:19.274
'cause you can never
have enough.

10:19.276 --> 10:20.507
- Emmet.
- What is it?

10:20.509 --> 10:22.976
Oh.

10:24.980 --> 10:26.981

10:54.810 --> 10:56.711
Sneak, sneak, sneak.

10:59.349 --> 11:02.149
We've never seen
anything like this.

11:02.151 --> 11:03.784
They're evolving.

11:03.786 --> 11:05.220
What is it up to?

11:05.222 --> 11:07.755
I don't know,
but that beat is pretty fresh.

11:13.629 --> 11:14.630
Uh-oh.

11:16.099 --> 11:18.768
Take it down!

11:24.406 --> 11:25.807

- Windshield wipers!

11:49.132 --> 11:50.430
Spiky blaster cannon!

11:50.432 --> 11:52.967
Snazzy racing stripes.

11:57.507 --> 11:59.473
I told you that house
would attract aliens!

11:59.475 --> 12:01.510
I can fix it.
I'll get us out of here.

12:07.450 --> 12:08.451
Look out!

12:14.357 --> 12:16.457
Hey! I think my dentist
used to work in this office.

12:16.459 --> 12:19.729

12:21.430 --> 12:23.030
It's like it knows
our every move!

12:23.032 --> 12:24.634
Weird, right?

12:26.234 --> 12:27.669
- Emmet!
- What?

12:27.671 --> 12:30.474
- Look out!
- No, no, no!

12:44.287 --> 12:46.623

Okay, that's adorable.

14:20.816 --> 14:24.019

14:24.021 --> 14:26.486
Good thing the door is closing
so slowly and dramatically.

14:26.488 --> 14:27.922

15:40.396 --> 15:44.130

15:46.435 --> 15:49.573
It's getting so cold.

15:54.209 --> 15:55.579

15:57.079 --> 15:58.746
I'm General Mayhem.

15:58.748 --> 16:02.015
Intergalactic Naval Commander
of the Systar System.

16:02.017 --> 16:03.951
Open the gate.

16:03.953 --> 16:05.119
No way!

16:05.121 --> 16:08.355
That gate is never,
ever, ever, ever...

16:08.357 --> 16:09.793
Emmet, what're you doing?

16:10.426 --> 16:12.360
Hooray!

16:12.362 --> 16:14.629
See? That wasn't so bad.
Nothing got in.

16:14.631 --> 16:16.063
Something got in.

16:16.065 --> 16:18.966
Bring me
your fiercest leader.

16:18.968 --> 16:21.936
Yeah, that's me.
This guy. Coming through.

16:21.938 --> 16:23.470
I'm the leader, obvs.

16:23.472 --> 16:25.405
You? I don't think so.

16:25.407 --> 16:26.874
How many movies
have they made about you?

16:26.876 --> 16:28.775
Because there are nine
about me,

16:28.777 --> 16:31.077
and like three others in
various stages of development.

16:31.079 --> 16:35.381
If ye be considered
a leader then why aren't we?

16:35.383 --> 16:37.183
- Yeah. I'm a princess.
- What about me? I'm a space commander.

16:37.185 --> 16:40.321
I'm literally
the captain of a pirate ship!

16:45.929 --> 16:48.462
- My helmet is very blue!
- Wait a minute.

16:48.464 --> 16:50.664
When everyone became
the Special,

16:50.666 --> 16:52.332
didn't we all become leaders?

16:52.334 --> 16:55.937
No offense, I sense no
leadership qualities from you.

16:55.939 --> 16:58.472
My readout confirms you
to be soft,

16:58.474 --> 17:01.042
fragile, and a less than
worthy opponent.

17:01.044 --> 17:03.010
Hey! You watch
what you say about Emmet.

17:03.012 --> 17:05.412
He saved the universe
a few years back.

17:05.414 --> 17:07.648
This guy was a fierce warrior?

17:07.651 --> 17:10.517
Okay, well, technically
I did the warrior stuff, but...

17:10.519 --> 17:12.986
So, you fought and
masterbuilt, and kicked butt,

17:12.988 --> 17:15.790
and then the hapless male
was the leader?

17:15.791 --> 17:20.294
Um, well, you know,
he was a symbol for...

17:20.296 --> 17:22.595
That we all have ideas and...

17:22.597 --> 17:24.932
- But you did all the work.
- Whoa... Hey!

17:24.934 --> 17:29.269
Emmet is the sweetest,
most optimistic guy you could ever meet.

17:29.271 --> 17:31.705
And I know those qualities
are not useful anymore,

17:31.707 --> 17:33.607
and that Emmet isn't changing
with the times,

17:33.609 --> 17:36.343
and lacks a killer instinct,
and in general, just isn't tough enough.

17:36.345 --> 17:38.111
Not tough enough?

17:38.113 --> 17:41.948
Yeah. But this guy is the Special.
Well, at least he was.

17:41.950 --> 17:43.152
Silence.

17:44.955 --> 17:47.521
I don't have room in my ship
to take everyone.

17:47.523 --> 17:49.290
I can fit maybe five.

17:49.292 --> 17:52.592

25:05.594 --> 25:09.132
Trust me,
my plans are totally sinister.

25:11.734 --> 25:13.234
- Sincere.
- Sincere.

25:13.236 --> 25:15.034
I just wanna help you guys.

25:15.036 --> 25:18.605
All I need is your participation
in a matrimonial ceremony.

25:18.607 --> 25:19.872
No way.

25:19.874 --> 25:22.042
Trust me,
it'll be totally terrifying.

25:23.179 --> 25:25.079
Terrific. That's what I meant.

25:25.081 --> 25:26.546
Why are we supposed to
trust you?

25:26.548 --> 25:29.417
I'll tell you
using a universal language.

25:29.419 --> 25:30.751
Is it math?

25:30.753 --> 25:33.219
The language that unites
all the planets in our system.

25:33.221 --> 25:35.621
Oh, no. Are we in a musical?

25:35.623 --> 25:37.457
Yep, get ready.

Oh, I liked the tune.
Especially the spaceship part.

28:28.729 --> 28:30.796
And also, no other parts,
just the spaceship part.

28:30.798 --> 28:33.367
Artist to artist, I could tell
it was from the heart.

28:33.369 --> 28:35.334
I knew I would like you.

28:35.336 --> 28:38.072

28:40.575 --> 28:41.774
I am perfect.

28:41.776 --> 28:44.143
What is this
matrimonial ceremony, buster?

28:44.145 --> 28:45.445
Oh, it's gonna be fun.

28:45.447 --> 28:46.746
I built a Space Temple

28:46.748 --> 28:48.415
right in the center
of our universe.

28:48.417 --> 28:51.184
<i>And at 5:15,
all the stars will align,</i>

28:51.186 --> 28:54.153
<i>and we'll hold a wedding
between me and the Man of Bats.</i>

28:54.155 --> 28:55.655
The rest of y'all

28:55.657 --> 28:57.056
are gonna be
in the wedding party.

28:57.058 --> 28:58.691
And once we say, "I do"...

29:00.796 --> 29:04.296
Then you'll get all those
gifts I promised y'all.

29:04.298 --> 29:06.533
You're lying. It's gonna
summon Armamageddon,

29:06.535 --> 29:09.503
and we're gonna get tossed into
the Bin of Storajj forever.

29:09.505 --> 29:10.905
Whoa. No, no, no. No, no, no.

29:10.907 --> 29:13.273
Back up a quick sec.
Did you say "wedding"?

29:13.275 --> 29:15.408
Man, you agreed
to half of everything.

29:15.410 --> 29:17.578
No, no, no. No to the no.

29:17.580 --> 29:19.411
I thought you were the leader.

29:19.413 --> 29:23.649
Uh, yeah, I mean,
I am obviously leader guy.

29:23.651 --> 29:24.817
But I'm not...

29:24.819 --> 29:26.753
Doesn't mean
that I'm ready to settle...

29:26.755 --> 29:28.688
I'm not gonna be the guy

29:28.690 --> 29:31.057
who's gonna make
that kind of a leap...

29:31.059 --> 29:35.195
None of us will be part
of your wedding ceremony, ever.

29:35.197 --> 29:38.130
Y'all are so dusty,
tough, and grouchy.

29:38.132 --> 29:40.534
Take them to get changed
for the ceremony.

29:40.536 --> 29:44.606
And this one needs to
get changed most of all.

29:53.716 --> 29:54.915
Whoa!

29:54.917 --> 29:58.387
It's the portal
to dimensions unknown.

29:59.321 --> 30:01.888
The Stairgate.

30:03.191 --> 30:04.858
I'll just push through
the Stairgate.

30:04.860 --> 30:06.596
Seems simple enough.

30:20.642 --> 30:22.344
Glassteroids!

30:24.278 --> 30:26.516
I can do this.
Torpedoes deploy!

30:29.151 --> 30:32.620
Huh. I can do...

30:32.622 --> 30:33.823
I can't do this.

30:39.728 --> 30:42.062
This is the end!

30:49.837 --> 30:51.507
Who was that?

30:52.673 --> 30:54.541
- Where did he go?
- Hey!

30:54.543 --> 30:56.508
You mind if I save your life?

30:56.510 --> 30:58.410
- Not at all.
- Rad.

31:29.944 --> 31:33.412
And that's how you break on
through to the other side...

31:33.414 --> 31:35.682
Of the Stairgate.

31:35.684 --> 31:37.219
Who are you?

31:39.287 --> 31:40.688
Whoa!

31:40.690 --> 31:43.623
The name's Rex,
Rex Dangervest.

31:43.625 --> 31:45.692
<i>Galaxy-defending
archeologist, cowboy,</i>

31:45.694 --> 31:48.661
<i>raptor trainer, who likes
building furniture, busting heads,</i>

31:48.663 --> 31:49.996
<i>and having chiseled features,</i>

31:49.998 --> 31:52.065
<i>previously hidden
under baby fat.</i>

31:52.067 --> 31:54.167
Whoa! Enemy ship!

31:54.169 --> 31:55.302
That's a negative.

31:55.304 --> 31:57.537
That bad boy is my ship.

31:57.539 --> 32:00.542
Built her myself
out of spare pieces.

32:02.576 --> 32:04.512
Let me show ya around.

32:05.980 --> 32:07.281
Hey, you broke my ship.

32:07.283 --> 32:09.549
Listen, kid,
you can build anything,

32:09.551 --> 32:11.517
but there ain't nothing
you can't break.

32:13.321 --> 32:14.487
I don't get it.

32:14.489 --> 32:16.523
How about a tour?

32:16.525 --> 32:19.458
Behold, the <i>Rexcelsior.</i>

32:19.460 --> 32:21.861
Whoa-ho-ho!

32:21.863 --> 32:23.563
Are those dinosaurs?

32:31.840 --> 32:33.806
Whoa!

32:33.808 --> 32:35.941
Tell me,
what's a scrapabout like you

32:35.943 --> 32:38.977
doing trying to
go through the Stairgate?

32:38.979 --> 32:41.681
Aliens from the Systar System
kidnapped my friends.

32:41.683 --> 32:43.483
I'm going to get them back.

32:43.485 --> 32:47.420
You don't wanna go anywhere near
the Systar System, trust me.

32:47.422 --> 32:51.224
It's ruled by an alien queen,
and she'll try to brainwash your friends,

32:51.226 --> 32:55.394
so she can use 'em in a matrimonial
ceremony to bring forth...

32:55.396 --> 32:57.296
- Armamageddon?
- Bingo.

32:57.298 --> 33:00.300
You've been to the Systar System?
You can help me.

33:00.302 --> 33:02.136
Forget it, kid.

33:02.138 --> 33:03.937
That place is too terrible.

33:03.939 --> 33:07.640
But I don't like to talk about
my backstory, so don't even ask.

33:07.642 --> 33:09.542
- Oh. Okay.
- There I was,

33:09.544 --> 33:11.544
<i>on a galactic mission.</i>

33:11.546 --> 33:14.480
<i>Ended up being
more than I'd bargained for.</i>

33:18.553 --> 33:20.986
<i>I landed
in the desolate plains</i>

33:20.988 --> 33:24.724
<i>of the dust planet Undar
of the Dryar System.</i>

33:24.726 --> 33:27.894
<i>The winds were ferocious.</i>

33:27.896 --> 33:31.430
<i>The isolation, intense.</i>

33:32.668 --> 33:34.301
<i>I waited for my friends.</i>

33:38.039 --> 33:40.041
<i>Seemed to last forever.</i>

33:46.282 --> 33:48.117
<i>That's when I learned...</i>

33:50.419 --> 33:53.320
There was no one
I could trust but me.

33:53.322 --> 33:55.488
I'm so sorry, Rex.

33:55.490 --> 33:58.891
Don't be. My time alone
was an awakening.

33:58.893 --> 34:01.694
I learned how
the universe really works.

34:01.696 --> 34:03.496
Yeah, I know how you feel.

34:03.498 --> 34:06.365
Ha! You couldn't possibly
know how it feels.

34:06.367 --> 34:08.034
Yeah, I do.

34:08.036 --> 34:10.603
Like you can't ever go back
to the person you used to be.

34:10.605 --> 34:12.170
Even though it was
so much simpler.

34:12.172 --> 34:15.609
You have to find your own way.

34:15.610 --> 34:17.476
But you just don't know how.

34:17.478 --> 34:18.712
Hold up a second.

34:18.714 --> 34:21.447
- You have been there.
- Yeah.

34:21.449 --> 34:23.951
What's your last name, Emmet?

34:23.953 --> 34:25.152
Brickowski.

34:25.154 --> 34:26.752
No way.

34:26.754 --> 34:29.154
The visionary
double-decker-couch-building hero

34:29.156 --> 34:31.491
who took it to Lord Business
and had the guts

34:31.493 --> 34:32.725
to face The Man Upstairs?

34:32.726 --> 34:35.395
That Emmet Brickowski?

34:35.397 --> 34:36.897
Yeah.

34:36.899 --> 34:37.763
Dude! Big fan!

34:37.764 --> 34:39.833
Wait, you are a fan of me?

34:39.835 --> 34:42.502
Heck yeah. You're the reason
I started wearing vests.

34:42.504 --> 34:44.937
- Do you like mine?
- Yes, I do!

34:47.243 --> 34:51.009
Also started wearing chaps,
which are essentially leg-vests.

34:51.011 --> 34:54.647
Wow. You're so much more cool
and grown-up than me.

34:54.649 --> 34:56.750
You could teach me!

34:56.752 --> 34:59.786
Rex, help me rescue my
friends, stop Armamageddon,

34:59.788 --> 35:02.288
and teach me to be like you.

35:02.290 --> 35:03.924
Someone Lucy will be proud of.

35:03.926 --> 35:08.527
And I'll be the brother
you never had.

35:08.529 --> 35:11.499
Unless you do have a brother.
I don't really know you that well.

35:15.471 --> 35:16.803
All right, kid, you listen.

35:16.805 --> 35:18.906
You go soft,
you're playing their game.

35:18.908 --> 35:22.641
You're gonna have to grow up
and grow up fast.

35:22.643 --> 35:24.277
Are you ready to do that?

35:24.279 --> 35:26.279
Yes, I am.

35:26.281 --> 35:28.015
I can't hear you.

35:28.017 --> 35:30.049
Really? I was speaking
at normal volume.

35:30.051 --> 35:31.851
Sorry, man. I'm just
a little hard of hearing

35:31.853 --> 35:33.719
from listening to
my mixtapes super loud

35:33.721 --> 35:35.420
with no regard
for my future hearing,

35:35.422 --> 35:36.790
because I live in the now.

35:36.792 --> 35:39.792
Raptors, re-coordinate.

35:39.794 --> 35:43.596
- Really?
- Set a course for the Systar System.

35:43.598 --> 35:46.232
Rex, I promise
you won't regret it.

35:46.234 --> 35:49.969
Kid, I invented the phrase
"no regrets."

35:49.971 --> 35:53.038
I do have one regret
of not trademarking it.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.042
Space cannons.

35:55.343 --> 35:56.743
Hyper-light-speed combustor.

35:58.147 --> 35:59.846
Super-rad ejector button.

35:59.848 --> 36:01.415
Whoa. Isn't there
a better place to put that?

36:01.417 --> 36:02.616
Raptors, power up.

36:02.618 --> 36:03.716
Crank the warp drive up to 11.

36:03.718 --> 36:06.087
Times two.

36:08.357 --> 36:10.226
Yeah!

36:14.796 --> 36:17.065
To the Systar System.

36:24.272 --> 36:25.705
That queen
is never gonna break us.

36:25.707 --> 36:27.774
She just wants
to throw a party.

36:27.776 --> 36:30.611
It's clearly a cover
for some catastrophic event.

36:30.613 --> 36:31.978
Yeah. Marriage, am I right?

36:31.980 --> 36:34.112
No one's tying down
this Batman forever.

36:34.114 --> 36:35.748
Ooh, reference!

36:35.750 --> 36:39.252
No. The moment you say,
"I do," it'll unlock some...

36:39.254 --> 36:42.254
- What are you looking at?
- What are you hiding?

36:42.256 --> 36:43.489
What are you hiding?

36:43.491 --> 36:44.623
You're the one with

36:44.625 --> 36:45.757
the reflective mask.

36:45.759 --> 36:46.859
Well, I asked you first.

36:46.861 --> 36:48.261
Well, I asked you second.

36:48.263 --> 36:50.362
Real mature.

36:50.364 --> 36:51.596
So, where are we going?

36:51.598 --> 36:53.634
Planet Sparkles.

36:53.636 --> 36:55.935
Sparkles.

36:55.937 --> 37:00.040
There, you will get changed
in more ways than one.

37:00.042 --> 37:01.507
Hello!

37:01.509 --> 37:03.009
What was that?

37:03.011 --> 37:05.846
I said,
"Hello!"

37:05.848 --> 37:07.781
Well, we've been talking
for a while.

37:07.783 --> 37:09.583
I'm not sure
why you're saying hello now...

37:09.585 --> 37:11.787
But fine. Hello to you.

37:21.629 --> 37:24.429
Stick together.
I've got a plan.

37:24.431 --> 37:26.366
Greetings, Bricksburgians.

37:26.368 --> 37:29.101
Welcome to the
Palace of Infinite Reflection.

37:29.103 --> 37:32.371
A self-reeducation
celebrity center.

37:32.373 --> 37:33.906
Namaste.

37:33.908 --> 37:36.408
Ooh! Sounds spiritual.

37:36.410 --> 37:37.810
It is so spiritual.

37:37.812 --> 37:39.812
Sounds like a trap.
This guy's a vampire.

37:39.814 --> 37:42.515
Attractive non-threatening
teen vampire.

37:42.517 --> 37:44.116
I like to talk about feelings,

37:44.118 --> 37:46.953
and how we're in love,
but can't be together.

37:46.955 --> 37:48.221
Isn't that beautiful?

37:48.223 --> 37:50.623
I'll answer that.
It's very beautiful.

37:50.625 --> 37:52.891
The heart wants what it wants.

37:52.893 --> 37:57.062
I also DJ on the side
and wear women's jeans.

37:57.064 --> 37:58.263
Wow!

37:58.265 --> 38:00.799
Guys, we have to stay tough
and gritty.

38:00.801 --> 38:02.636
Do not let them
soften you up...

38:02.638 --> 38:06.938
Oh, yeah. I love getting barnacles
scrubbed off me bilge pump.

38:06.940 --> 38:08.507
Really? Right into it.

38:08.509 --> 38:09.676
Oh, oh! It tickles.

38:09.678 --> 38:11.511
Whee!

38:11.513 --> 38:15.781
Oh, yeah, I carry my tortured
past in my chiseled glutes.

38:15.783 --> 38:17.516
Even you?

38:17.518 --> 38:19.685
What? I mean,
I'm not gonna turn down a free massage.

38:19.687 --> 38:21.788
She needs extra treatment.

38:21.790 --> 38:23.489
- No!
- Yes.

38:23.491 --> 38:24.991
First, you'll get a hot gem massage.

38:24.993 --> 38:27.326
Then an exfoliating
flower beatdown.

38:27.328 --> 38:29.395
Popsicle face mask and peel.

38:29.397 --> 38:31.998
- Room-temperature stone contusion.
- Hey!

38:32.000 --> 38:33.667
Vegetable observation...

38:33.669 --> 38:35.067
And be cleansed
with a glitter scrub

38:35.069 --> 38:36.768
- and sparkle rinse.
- Ah!

38:36.770 --> 38:38.138
Next...

38:38.140 --> 38:39.642
- Your hair!
- It's...

38:41.142 --> 38:43.009
- It's beautiful.
- Wait, what?

38:43.011 --> 38:44.710
Oh, no, no, no, no.

38:44.712 --> 38:46.212
What? Wow!

38:46.214 --> 38:48.114
Guys, this is not
what you think.

38:48.116 --> 38:50.817
It's so adorable and cute!

38:50.819 --> 38:53.386
Are you covering up
some un-dark past?

38:53.388 --> 38:56.455
No. It's not who I am.
It's just hair.

38:56.457 --> 38:59.093
Look, if I pop it off,
am I Bruce Willis now?

38:59.727 --> 39:00.993
I don't think so.

39:00.995 --> 39:03.996
Well, well, well.
I thought ye were tough.

39:03.998 --> 39:06.031
Looks like the peg's
on the other leg.

39:06.033 --> 39:07.799
- I didn't...
- Is she secretly cutesy?

39:07.801 --> 39:09.636
Look, they did this, okay?
Not me!

39:09.638 --> 39:12.772
I mean, what?
I sat in the mirror years ago in shame

39:12.774 --> 39:14.239
and took a permanent marker,

39:14.241 --> 39:16.708
and hair by hair just,
you know, recolored it?

39:16.710 --> 39:20.179
I mean, what kind of crazy
person would do that? Ugh!

39:20.181 --> 39:23.382
Pardon my language,
but she's a real grumpledumpuss.

39:23.384 --> 39:26.351
Take her for some music therapy.

39:26.353 --> 39:29.792
Then she'll be willing
to join our ceremony.

39:40.435 --> 39:43.703
Lucy, where are you?

39:43.705 --> 39:45.871
I'm so sorry.

39:45.873 --> 39:48.708
You're not gonna find her
whispering into a window.

39:48.710 --> 39:50.009
It's time to take action.

39:50.011 --> 39:51.444
Which planet do you
wanna try first?

39:51.446 --> 39:53.145
Um... What do you think?

39:53.147 --> 39:55.382
A tough guy doesn't ask
where to go.

39:55.384 --> 39:57.583
Just pick any of 'em
and act like you're sure.

39:57.585 --> 39:59.518
That's called leadership.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.020
Okay. That one.

40:01.022 --> 40:02.522
Now you're getting it!

40:06.093 --> 40:07.794
Yeah! Now I feel it!

40:07.796 --> 40:10.062
I am feeling it and I like it!

40:10.064 --> 40:12.967
Everyone, suit up!

40:19.774 --> 40:20.973
Only the toughest

40:20.975 --> 40:22.509
are gonna get out
of there alive.

40:22.511 --> 40:24.377
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

40:24.379 --> 40:27.315
Yes, you are.

40:40.361 --> 40:43.663
It's 4:30.
The ticking clock is ticking.

40:43.665 --> 40:45.467
Let's go find your friends.

40:47.002 --> 40:50.969
Just a couple of tough guys
being tough.

40:50.971 --> 40:53.038
Planned that.

40:55.944 --> 40:58.844
We'll find
some answers this way.

41:01.015 --> 41:02.781
Where's Cobra?

41:02.783 --> 41:04.384
Rocky! Quaid!

41:04.386 --> 41:05.652
Ripley!

41:05.654 --> 41:07.353
Connor!

41:07.355 --> 41:08.557
The other one!

41:09.857 --> 41:11.558
Nobody move.

41:11.560 --> 41:13.192
I'm tracking unusual activity

41:13.194 --> 41:15.094
on my unusual
activity tracker.

41:15.096 --> 41:17.366
Not sure what to make of it.

41:20.435 --> 41:21.634
Huh?

41:25.006 --> 41:26.739
Emmet,
don't look 'em in the eyes.

41:26.741 --> 41:28.641
They'll get in your head.

41:31.478 --> 41:32.612
We gotta get out of here!

41:32.614 --> 41:34.013
Go, go, go!

41:34.015 --> 41:35.317
Going, going, going!

41:47.629 --> 41:49.696
We're surrounded!

41:49.698 --> 41:51.931
Don't you let them take advantage
of that big, beautiful heart of yours.

41:53.067 --> 41:54.801
Bust through, Emmet.

41:54.803 --> 41:56.268
You can do it!

41:59.841 --> 42:01.274
Hey, I did it!

42:01.276 --> 42:02.375
Nice work!

42:02.377 --> 42:03.976
Yeah, but they're
still coming!

42:03.978 --> 42:06.181
No biggie. Watch this.

42:07.147 --> 42:09.783
Whoa!

42:18.259 --> 42:19.158
Whoa!

42:19.160 --> 42:20.960
Not bad back there, kid.

42:20.962 --> 42:23.761
You know, you and I are more
alike than you might realize.

42:23.763 --> 42:26.533
Really? I mean, really cool.
Whatever. I don't care.

42:26.535 --> 42:28.266
But how did you do
that punch thing?

42:28.268 --> 42:30.502
You gotta break things down
to build 'em back up.

42:30.504 --> 42:32.304
Rex!

42:32.306 --> 42:34.674
Life's impermanent.
Always changing.

42:34.676 --> 42:36.342
You can't hang on to the past.

42:36.344 --> 42:38.578
Otherwise we might as well
all be Kragled.

42:38.580 --> 42:39.980
So deep.

42:39.982 --> 42:41.913
Oh, yeah, thanks.
I've been meditating a lot.

42:41.915 --> 42:43.683
So, it makes sense.

42:43.685 --> 42:46.252
Emmet, listen,
if we're gonna rescue your friends,

42:46.254 --> 42:48.420
you're gonna need to be a...

42:48.422 --> 42:50.156
Master Breaker.

42:50.158 --> 42:51.924
You would teach it to me?
How do you do it?

42:51.926 --> 42:54.828
Well, you have to connect to
some pretty grown-up feelings.

42:54.830 --> 42:57.464
Abandonment. Regret.
Anger at...

42:57.466 --> 42:58.630
A lamppost?

42:58.632 --> 43:01.701
Yeah, lampposts are
the worst because...

43:01.703 --> 43:02.905
Um...

43:03.370 --> 43:04.372
Oh.

43:15.649 --> 43:16.915
- Hi!
- Hello!

43:16.917 --> 43:18.750
Good morning!

43:18.752 --> 43:20.219
What is this place?

43:20.221 --> 43:23.121
Emmet, welcome to heck.

43:25.593 --> 43:27.228
Extry! Extry!

43:30.098 --> 43:32.165
- Superman?
- Oh, hey, Emmet.

43:32.167 --> 43:34.100
Superman, what are you doing?

43:34.102 --> 43:35.667
Oh, just mowing my lawn.

43:35.669 --> 43:37.335
Want everything to be perfect
for the wedding ceremony.

43:37.337 --> 43:39.071
Where is it? Where's Lucy?
Where's our friends?

43:39.073 --> 43:40.605
At the Space Temple, you goof.

43:40.607 --> 43:42.607
Wait. Two questions.
One, where's the Space Temple?

43:42.609 --> 43:44.277
Two, why are you here?

43:44.279 --> 43:46.145
What are you talking about?
It's great here.

43:46.147 --> 43:47.879
I never wanna leave.

43:47.881 --> 43:50.817
By the way, "S" stands for "Silly" now.
I'm Sillyman.

43:50.819 --> 43:52.650
Why didn't you come back
for us?

43:52.652 --> 43:55.455
Ah, we're just all having so much
fun here and we're all friends.

43:55.457 --> 43:56.922
I know. What's up, GL?

43:56.924 --> 43:58.357
I see you, boy.

43:58.359 --> 44:00.491
Hey! Oh, here comes Lex
with the smoothies.

44:00.493 --> 44:03.830
Who wants a mango-berry blast
with a reusable straw?

44:03.832 --> 44:05.431
Lex Luthor?

44:05.433 --> 44:07.565
You're friends with your sworn
enemy, Lex Luthor?

44:07.567 --> 44:10.435
Guys, General Zod
just made homemade guac.

44:10.437 --> 44:12.573
He's a Zod-send.

44:13.674 --> 44:15.375
I'm glittery!

44:15.377 --> 44:17.308
Why are you all acting different?

44:17.310 --> 44:21.246
We all listened to the music,
and it really changed our attitude.

44:21.248 --> 44:24.116
You have to listen
to the music.

44:24.118 --> 44:28.386
Listen to the music
and let your mind go.

44:28.388 --> 44:31.123
- Let's sing him the song.
- That is a great idea, Lexy.

44:31.125 --> 44:32.658
I have an excellent
singing voice.

44:32.660 --> 44:35.094

44:37.131 --> 44:38.797

44:43.603 --> 44:46.438
I don't wanna listen
to a song.

44:46.440 --> 44:49.308
Just listen to the music
and let your mind go.

44:49.310 --> 44:51.480
Hey! Whoa. Back off. Huh?

44:52.781 --> 44:54.746
Ow!

44:54.748 --> 44:57.248
Subject her
to catchy pop music.

44:57.250 --> 44:59.618
That will change her tune.

44:59.620 --> 45:03.788
I'll start with one that's
sure to get stuck in her head.

My leg is a piano!

45:49.937 --> 45:54.172
This song is stuck in my head,
and my head loves it.

45:54.174 --> 45:55.741
- Join the party!
- No! Guys!

45:55.743 --> 45:57.509
Boom!

45:57.511 --> 45:59.444
What's wrong with you?
You're not acting like yourselves.

45:59.446 --> 46:02.880

Don't listen
to the music, Emmet,

46:08.455 --> 46:10.757
if you want your noodle
to stay al dente!

46:10.759 --> 46:11.924
Emmet?

46:11.926 --> 46:13.426
My body is worming.

46:13.428 --> 46:15.493
I didn't know
I knew how to do this!

46:15.495 --> 46:17.995
Get yourself together.

46:17.997 --> 46:19.198
We'll be safe inside of...

46:20.634 --> 46:21.734
Hey, guys!

46:21.736 --> 46:22.935
They're everywhere!

46:30.444 --> 46:33.280
Connor? Ripley? The other one?

46:34.549 --> 46:35.982
Don't be a grumpledumpuss!

46:35.984 --> 46:38.750
Don't you see?
They are trying to change us.

46:38.752 --> 46:41.353
Don't worry, this song has,
like, zero effect on me.

46:41.355 --> 46:44.357
- You're dancing.
- Uh, don't look at me.

46:44.359 --> 46:46.091
Rex! Help me!

46:46.093 --> 46:48.826
Think hard thoughts, Emmet.
Think hard thoughts...

46:48.828 --> 46:52.632
Or the rhythm is
gonna get ya!

46:52.634 --> 46:56.368
Shoulder, stay still! Stop it!

46:56.370 --> 46:59.573
No! No! No! No! No! No!

47:02.509 --> 47:03.544
Yes!

47:09.683 --> 47:11.484
- Bruce?
- Willis. Yeah.

47:11.486 --> 47:14.319
I spend a lot of time
in air ducts.

47:14.321 --> 47:16.955
I definitely
don't live up here.

47:16.957 --> 47:18.491
I have a home.

47:18.493 --> 47:20.428
- Just scooch on by.
- Ooh.

47:25.299 --> 47:26.933
Ugh!

47:32.573 --> 47:34.507
<i>♪ This song's gonna
Get stuck inside your ♪</i>

47:36.444 --> 47:38.176
It's a dead end!

47:38.178 --> 47:39.844
My CPD,
convenient plot device,

47:39.846 --> 47:41.714
shows there's a planet
right below us.

47:41.716 --> 47:43.216
It's our only way out of here.

47:43.218 --> 47:45.585
I'll hold 'em back.
You bust us out.

47:45.587 --> 47:46.752
I don't know how to do that!

47:46.754 --> 47:48.788
Emmet, I know
you can do this.

47:48.790 --> 47:50.221
What makes you mad?

47:50.223 --> 47:52.223
- A lamppost?
- Come on!

47:52.225 --> 47:53.993
They took Lucy and the others.

47:53.995 --> 47:56.629
And how does that
make you feel?

47:56.631 --> 47:58.263
- Not good.
- More honest.

47:58.265 --> 47:59.464
Super not good!

47:59.466 --> 48:00.966
You're getting close now,
brother!

48:00.968 --> 48:04.170
Crack that pain bone open
and suck out the marrow!

48:04.172 --> 48:06.038
What do you feel?

48:06.040 --> 48:10.308
I feel very afraid of losing Lucy
forever and it being my fault,

48:10.310 --> 48:13.078
because I wasn't able
to change!

48:15.315 --> 48:16.618
Ouch!

48:18.152 --> 48:19.585
Whoa!

48:19.587 --> 48:20.689
I did it!

48:22.823 --> 48:23.989
Nice job, kid.

48:23.991 --> 48:26.058
How is there outer space
under this sidewalk?

48:26.060 --> 48:28.493
I told you,
nothing in this place makes sense.

48:29.964 --> 48:31.864
Yeah!

48:33.567 --> 48:36.469
When are we gonna
stop falling?

48:37.906 --> 48:39.804
Now.

48:39.806 --> 48:41.910
Uh, Rex, do you hear a rumbling?

48:45.011 --> 48:47.279
Planet Duplo!

48:52.218 --> 48:56.121
This is really bad.

48:56.123 --> 48:59.391
<i>Buses are now leaving
for the matrimonial ceremony.</i>

48:59.393 --> 49:00.826
Find her.

49:00.828 --> 49:03.295
I must deliver the Man of Bats
to the queen.

49:03.297 --> 49:04.862
I'm not going anywhere.

49:04.864 --> 49:06.600
All right, I stand corrected.
I am going somewhere.

49:12.607 --> 49:14.373
Hmm. More confetti!

49:14.375 --> 49:17.475
More glitter!
More frosting! Mmm!

49:17.477 --> 49:20.511
Oh, I love
the chocolate fondue fountain.

49:20.513 --> 49:22.880
Life is so fragile.

49:22.882 --> 49:24.650
Call from General Mayhem.

49:24.652 --> 49:26.451
Okay. Everybody, take five.

49:26.453 --> 49:27.986
Banana, peel out.

49:30.792 --> 49:33.926
Hey! You bringin' the Man
of Bats to the Space Temple?

49:33.928 --> 49:35.795
<i>I am on my way.</i>

49:35.797 --> 49:38.129

49:38.131 --> 49:41.799
<i>But the one they call

49:41.801 --> 49:44.636
Don't worry.
She'll come to us.

49:44.638 --> 49:46.772
And we'll be ready for her.

49:50.310 --> 49:54.279
Sorry. Banana keeps slipping
on his peel on the way out.

49:55.683 --> 49:57.449
You gonna bruise yo' butt.

50:10.431 --> 50:11.931
All right, you guys.

50:11.933 --> 50:13.665
The queen says we gotta
get these bricks sorted

50:13.667 --> 50:16.070
and up to the Space Temple
before the ceremony starts.

50:16.904 --> 50:18.373
Let's go! Go! Go!

50:20.007 --> 50:22.308
Rex! I think I know
what to do.

50:22.310 --> 50:23.475
What's your plan?

50:23.477 --> 50:25.544
We're gonna have to hang, bro.

50:25.546 --> 50:28.917
I catch you.
Grab and go, <i>amigo!</i>

50:30.518 --> 50:32.887
Whoa!

50:37.390 --> 50:38.857
Well done.

50:38.859 --> 50:42.962
The student has become
the teaching assistant.

50:42.964 --> 50:43.962

- Where be Batman, too?

51:16.129 --> 51:17.897
What? I can't hear
what you're saying.

51:17.899 --> 51:20.900
I'm too busy partying!

51:22.335 --> 51:25.170
Good thing

- I'm here to save you!

52:00.140 --> 52:01.806
We're saving each other!

52:01.808 --> 52:03.975
Wow. You made it
all the way here.

52:03.977 --> 52:05.710
I can't believe it!

52:05.712 --> 52:08.379
You better believe it, sister.

52:08.381 --> 52:09.681
Whoa. Who is this guy?

52:09.683 --> 52:11.049
So, you can see him?

52:11.051 --> 52:12.884
I was so worried
he was just a projection

52:12.886 --> 52:15.319
of what my ego needs deep
down, but, no, he's real. Cool!

52:15.321 --> 52:17.154
I'm Rex Dangervest.

<i>Social media influencer!

52:19.192 --> 52:21.060
<i>Man of the soil!

52:21.062 --> 52:24.964
And my middle name's Machete
Ninjastar, so I know tough.

52:24.966 --> 52:26.998
And Emmet is one tough cookie.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.870
He's a cookie so tough and
hard, you can't even chew it,

52:30.872 --> 52:34.339
'cause it turns out it's not a
cookie, it's a chainsaw.

52:34.341 --> 52:37.475
- Huh, really?
- Yeah. I grew up.

52:37.477 --> 52:39.310
Just like you wanted.

52:39.312 --> 52:42.880
Yeah. No, that's great.

52:42.882 --> 52:44.982
Mmm... I thought
you'd be more excited.

52:44.984 --> 52:46.252
Me, too.

52:46.254 --> 52:48.821
But it's good,
because that's what we need.

52:48.823 --> 52:50.522
They've got all our friends.

52:50.524 --> 52:52.625
Your nightmare,
Armamageddon's coming.

52:52.627 --> 52:54.426
We have to stop it
or we're all doomed.

52:54.428 --> 52:55.928
And it's all going down

52:55.930 --> 52:58.600
- right there at the...
- The Space Temple.

53:00.433 --> 53:02.868
And the clock from my dream.

53:02.870 --> 53:04.506
It's all coming true.

53:05.872 --> 53:08.607
- The Man of Bats.
- Welcome.

53:10.143 --> 53:11.476
Hey, girl, hey.

53:11.478 --> 53:13.712
I've detected
a deep emptiness in him.

53:13.714 --> 53:17.584
According to my calculations,
he's lonely.

53:18.618 --> 53:21.122
Among other things.

53:22.656 --> 53:24.957
I know how he feels.

53:24.959 --> 53:26.792
I mean,
what a weirdo.

53:26.794 --> 53:28.661
I totally
don't relate to that.

53:28.663 --> 53:31.429
The time
for Armamageddon nears.

53:31.431 --> 53:32.998
We must find a weakness.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.368
- If he doesn't say "I do," we...
- Relax, girl.

53:35.370 --> 53:37.268
I got this.

53:37.270 --> 53:39.304
I'll just leave you two alone.

53:40.707 --> 53:42.876
Okay, let's address
the elephant in the room.

53:44.377 --> 53:47.212
Listen, lady, don't try
any mind games.

53:47.214 --> 53:52.283
Batman is a permanent
Bat-chelor.

53:52.285 --> 53:55.855
Can you imagine if having a
family with someone I loved

53:55.857 --> 53:59.025
healed some of
my darkest trauma?

53:59.027 --> 54:00.025
Barf.

54:00.027 --> 54:02.361
There is no way
I'm marrying you.

54:02.363 --> 54:03.728
Well, of course not.

54:03.730 --> 54:05.629
Oh. Uh...
Yeah, but you said that...

54:05.631 --> 54:07.199
I wanted to marry you?

54:07.201 --> 54:08.833
No, no, no, honey.

54:08.835 --> 54:10.734
I was just saying that
to make the person

54:10.736 --> 54:13.339
I actually
wanna marry jealous.

54:13.341 --> 54:15.940
Good. So, I guess
we're done here or...

54:15.942 --> 54:18.076
Marry Batman.

54:18.078 --> 54:20.379
That's a good one. You funny.

54:20.381 --> 54:22.013
Yeah. And, um...

54:22.015 --> 54:25.784
Out of curiosity, why wouldn't
you wanna marry me?

54:25.786 --> 54:29.187
Just, you know, again,
purely for curiosity sake.

54:29.189 --> 54:31.190
Oh, I don't go
for guys like you.

54:31.192 --> 54:33.125
What do you mean, guys like me?

54:33.127 --> 54:35.527

54:35.529 --> 54:36.862

57:17.857 --> 57:19.392
- A toaster?
- Just trust me.

57:28.468 --> 57:29.667
Wow! That was cool.

57:29.669 --> 57:31.136
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah?

57:31.138 --> 57:32.638
It was. It was cool.

57:32.640 --> 57:36.377
What fresh nightmare
are they constructing here?

57:44.384 --> 57:47.486
It's a wedding cake of doom!

57:47.488 --> 57:49.054
Disgusting!

57:49.056 --> 57:51.556
How is a wedding ceremony
going to summon Armamageddon?

57:51.558 --> 57:53.893
I don't know, but we're not
gonna wait to find out.

57:53.895 --> 57:56.094
We can stop the ceremony
if we find a weakness

57:56.096 --> 57:57.629
in the temple and blow it up.

57:57.631 --> 57:59.598
I scanned the layout as we entered

57:59.600 --> 58:03.734
using my Implausitron,
one of my impossibly cool gadgets.

58:03.736 --> 58:07.839
This temple's clearly built as
a beacon for the end of days.

58:07.841 --> 58:10.641
Emmet, you're a construction worker.
What do you think?

58:10.643 --> 58:13.178
Great question, Rex.
I'll take it from here.

58:13.180 --> 58:15.013
Unique construction style.

58:15.015 --> 58:17.516
Seems to be built around this
entertainment center in the middle.

58:17.518 --> 58:19.685
Looks like
a magical relic

58:19.687 --> 58:22.953
that plays music as
a protective defense shield.

58:22.955 --> 58:24.723
Okay, I've got a plan.
We split up.

58:24.725 --> 58:29.828
Rex retrieves the <i>Rexcelsior</i> and
gets in Rextraction position.

58:29.830 --> 58:31.263
Ha! Not a fan of puns? Okay.

58:31.265 --> 58:33.198
Lucy unplugs
this entertainment center,

58:33.200 --> 58:35.167
which should deactivate
the defense shield...

58:35.169 --> 58:38.203
Then I'll do
the Master Breaker punch here,

58:38.205 --> 58:39.404
at the top
of the temple,

58:39.406 --> 58:41.272
which will start
a chain reaction,

58:41.274 --> 58:43.174
causing the whole place
to blow.

58:43.176 --> 58:45.976
Then Rex swoops in,
grabs us and our friends,

58:45.978 --> 58:47.946
and we all go home.

58:47.948 --> 58:49.681
Wow. That's a really
impressive plan.

58:49.683 --> 58:53.154
Thank you. Now grab a headset.
I don't wanna lose you again.

58:56.089 --> 58:57.455
Whoa! Lucy,
what's with your hair?

58:57.457 --> 58:59.558
Oh, it's nothing.
It was just a spa thing.

58:59.560 --> 59:01.859
Don't worry about it.
It's not my real hair.

59:01.861 --> 59:03.696
My real hair's
naturally black.

59:03.698 --> 59:05.663
She's lyin'.

59:05.665 --> 59:07.098
She wouldn't lie to me about something
as important as her hair color.

59:07.100 --> 59:08.766
- I'm not.
- She would

59:08.768 --> 59:10.736
if she was brainwashed.

59:10.738 --> 59:14.839
And you can't wash a brain without
washing the hair on top of that brain.

59:14.841 --> 59:16.007
It's basic science.

59:16.009 --> 59:18.042
Lucy, you're not...

59:18.044 --> 59:19.377
No.

59:19.379 --> 59:20.879
Are you?

59:20.881 --> 59:22.614
I'm not!
I'm not brainwashed!

59:22.616 --> 59:24.248
What about the rest
of our friends?

59:24.250 --> 59:26.120
Oh, they're brainwashed.
But I'm not.

59:27.187 --> 59:29.489
You sure we can trust her?

59:30.390 --> 59:31.823
Emmet?

59:31.825 --> 59:33.361
It's me.

59:35.395 --> 59:36.596
Emmet?

59:37.997 --> 59:39.399
I can always trust you.

59:41.734 --> 59:43.967
Now, you disconnect the shield,
and I'll blow up the temple.

59:43.969 --> 59:45.370
And I'll get my ship.

59:45.372 --> 59:48.205
We've got no time
to lose, because...

59:48.207 --> 59:52.109
It's 5:00 p.m.

59:52.111 --> 59:55.013
"The union
of Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi

59:55.015 --> 59:56.948
and Bruce Margolis Batman."

59:56.950 --> 59:59.250
I will say it is nice
that you have a vegan option,

59:59.252 --> 01:00:02.053
but we're gonna have to
reprint these all in black.

01:00:02.055 --> 01:00:04.255
- Bam!
- I like it.

01:00:04.257 --> 01:00:07.826
And instead of releasing
doves, how about bats?

01:00:07.828 --> 01:00:09.326
Ta-da!

01:00:09.328 --> 01:00:11.161
Sweet! I got an idea.

01:00:11.163 --> 01:00:13.931
What if, instead of throwing a
bouquet, if I throw a batarang,

01:00:13.933 --> 01:00:15.433
and whoever's chest
it lodges in

01:00:15.435 --> 01:00:18.069
is the next to get married?

01:00:18.071 --> 01:00:19.370
Love it, babe.

01:00:19.372 --> 01:00:21.906
I did not expect this
to be so much fun.

01:00:21.908 --> 01:00:24.775
Who would've thought that
this incorrigible gadabout

01:00:24.777 --> 01:00:26.243
would ever tie the knot?

01:00:26.245 --> 01:00:29.480
People change. I change,
like, every five seconds.

01:00:29.482 --> 01:00:30.582
Like this, boom.

01:00:30.584 --> 01:00:31.884
Oh. Uh-huh.

01:00:31.886 --> 01:00:33.819
I mean, this morning
I was all alone.

01:00:33.821 --> 01:00:37.254
Living in a giant palace with
only a fussy British servant,

01:00:37.256 --> 01:00:39.290
and no one
who could really relate to me.

01:00:39.292 --> 01:00:41.192
I can really relate to that.

01:00:41.194 --> 01:00:43.694
But along the way,
it got real.

01:00:43.696 --> 01:00:45.230
So, so real.

01:00:45.232 --> 01:00:47.165
Look at us,
two different worlds.

01:00:47.167 --> 01:00:48.866
Two people
who just need someone

01:00:48.868 --> 01:00:50.134
who understands us...

01:00:50.136 --> 01:00:52.036
To find real happiness.

01:00:52.038 --> 01:00:53.638
- Whoa! Jinx.
- Jinx!

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:54.772
Jinx.

01:00:54.774 --> 01:00:56.174
And final jinx.

01:00:56.176 --> 01:00:57.710
Oh, you're so jinxed,
both of you, aren't you?

01:00:57.712 --> 01:01:00.045
So, let's stop this forever.

01:01:00.047 --> 01:01:01.779
Have you been here
the whole time?

01:01:01.781 --> 01:01:04.484
Yeah. And I'm sad about it.

01:01:07.721 --> 01:01:09.487
So, then the centaur says,

01:01:09.489 --> 01:01:11.255
"That's not the half
I'm talking about."

01:01:12.593 --> 01:01:15.060
Okay, target detected.
I'm closing in.

01:01:15.062 --> 01:01:17.062
- <i>10-4, good buddy.</i>
- <i>10-4 you, good buddy.</i>

01:01:17.064 --> 01:01:18.830
<i>You're the good buddy,
buddy.</i>

01:01:18.832 --> 01:01:20.364
- <i>Is that Bruce Willis?</i>
- <i>Hey, guys.</i>

01:01:20.366 --> 01:01:22.435
<i>Good one, Bruce Willis!</i>

01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:25.837
Get to the bridal suite
without getting brainwashed.

01:01:25.839 --> 01:01:27.371
Think hard thoughts.

01:01:27.373 --> 01:01:29.107
Brood. Brood. Brood!

01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:30.408
Brood!

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:31.643
Did you just say "brood"?

01:01:31.645 --> 01:01:34.245
No, "bride"!
I need to see the bride.

01:01:34.247 --> 01:01:37.181
I'm sorry, no entry allowed.
Who are you?

01:01:37.183 --> 01:01:39.984
Who, me?

01:01:39.986 --> 01:01:41.386
I'm your worst nightmare.

01:01:41.388 --> 01:01:43.788
You're me when I'm late
to school,

01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:46.792
and I forgot my homework and
my pants are made of pudding?

01:01:46.794 --> 01:01:49.226
No, I don't...

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.101
Mayhem!
Is everything in order for the ceremony?

01:01:57.103 --> 01:01:59.471
Yes, I will operate
everything here

01:01:59.473 --> 01:02:02.207
from this
home entertainment center.

01:02:02.209 --> 01:02:03.808
There it is.

01:02:03.810 --> 01:02:04.909
You so get me.

01:02:04.911 --> 01:02:06.478
No. You so get me.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.279
No, no, no. You so get me.

01:02:08.281 --> 01:02:09.614
They brainwashed Batman.

01:02:09.616 --> 01:02:11.382
Wow, they're good,
because he is dense.

01:02:11.384 --> 01:02:13.317
Let's both say the first word
that pops in our heads

01:02:13.319 --> 01:02:14.486
and see if it's the same.

01:02:14.488 --> 01:02:16.286
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

01:02:16.288 --> 01:02:17.922
- Party!
- Batman!

01:02:17.924 --> 01:02:19.658
Oh, that's crazy,
'cause Batman is all for partying.

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:21.625
- So, that's basically the same word.
- Totally.

01:02:21.627 --> 01:02:22.726
Totally.

01:02:22.728 --> 01:02:23.795
- Totally.
- Totally.

01:02:23.797 --> 01:02:25.596
Final totally. And end it.

01:02:25.598 --> 01:02:27.199
We've gotta get upstairs.
The show's starting.

01:02:27.201 --> 01:02:29.199
Mayhem,
do the boopity-bop-bop.

01:02:29.201 --> 01:02:30.603
Boopity-bop-bop.

01:02:34.507 --> 01:02:36.540
Bring down the house,
my queen.

01:02:36.542 --> 01:02:38.678
This house is about to
get tore up.

01:02:49.723 --> 01:02:51.123
We've been expecting you.

01:02:51.125 --> 01:02:55.027
Then expect the unexpected!

01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:56.562
Did you expect this?

01:02:56.564 --> 01:02:58.362
Yes.

01:02:58.364 --> 01:03:01.966
Well,
I expected your expecting our expecting.

01:03:01.968 --> 01:03:05.870
And I expected your expecting
of my expecting your...

01:03:05.872 --> 01:03:07.408
Wait, now I'm lost.

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.410
Yay! Whee!

01:03:16.116 --> 01:03:18.082
I feel dizzy.

01:03:27.995 --> 01:03:32.330
Citizens of the 11 planets
of the Systar System!

01:03:32.332 --> 01:03:34.933
I ask you
to put your hands together

01:03:34.935 --> 01:03:36.933
and apart, and together again

01:03:36.935 --> 01:03:39.270
in a repeated fashion.

01:03:46.279 --> 01:03:48.011
Broody Judy,
this is Stubble Trouble.

01:03:48.013 --> 01:03:49.614
What's your status?

01:03:49.616 --> 01:03:51.915
Hello? Lucy?

01:03:51.917 --> 01:03:53.317
She's not answering.

01:03:53.319 --> 01:03:54.953
- Uh-oh.
- Is that bad?

01:03:54.955 --> 01:03:56.587
An "uh-oh"? Never good.

01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:58.156
I thought she might've been

01:03:58.158 --> 01:04:00.025
more brainwashed
than she was letting on.

01:04:00.027 --> 01:04:03.929
No. No, not Lucy.
She is the toughest there is.

01:04:03.931 --> 01:04:06.300
Unless that song got stuck
in her head.

01:04:06.834 --> 01:04:08.833
Lucy. Lucy?

01:04:08.835 --> 01:04:10.938
<i>Come on, Lucy, where are you?</i>

01:04:12.305 --> 01:04:14.505
Allow me to introduce...

01:04:14.507 --> 01:04:15.839
The wedding party.

01:04:15.841 --> 01:04:18.342
Supporting the bride
are Marie Curie...

01:04:18.344 --> 01:04:20.145
Chocolate Bar...

01:04:20.147 --> 01:04:21.446
The Tin Man...

01:04:21.448 --> 01:04:23.580
And Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

01:04:23.582 --> 01:04:26.150
Bearing the rings, Banana.

01:04:26.152 --> 01:04:28.319
Okay, okay. You can do this.

01:04:28.321 --> 01:04:29.886
Don't mess this...

01:04:29.888 --> 01:04:32.257
I messed it up! I messed it up!

01:04:32.259 --> 01:04:33.792
No!

01:04:33.794 --> 01:04:35.359
I'm slipping! Don't look at me!

01:04:35.361 --> 01:04:37.596
No!

01:04:37.598 --> 01:04:39.964
This is my nightmare!

01:04:39.966 --> 01:04:42.268
I had a dream about this!
Don't look at me!

01:04:43.837 --> 01:04:47.272
And on the groom's
side, MetalBeard...

01:04:47.274 --> 01:04:48.940
Arr!

01:04:48.942 --> 01:04:50.641
- Unikitty...
- Hi!

01:04:50.643 --> 01:04:52.377
And that spaceman, Benny.

01:04:52.379 --> 01:04:53.844
Spaceship!

01:04:53.846 --> 01:04:55.279
Oh, no, my friends.

01:04:55.281 --> 01:04:56.681
I barely recognize them.

01:04:56.683 --> 01:04:58.415
Don't worry
about your friends.

01:04:58.417 --> 01:04:59.717
Don't worry about Lucy.

01:04:59.719 --> 01:05:02.453
Focus on what you need to do.

01:05:02.455 --> 01:05:05.459
Visualize your success.

01:05:11.397 --> 01:05:13.931
He did it!

01:05:13.933 --> 01:05:15.500
He's so tough!

01:05:15.502 --> 01:05:17.902
We were so wrong about him.

01:05:17.904 --> 01:05:19.540
Way to go, Emmet.

01:05:20.372 --> 01:05:22.775
You've changed, perfectly.

01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:25.842
Your future is bright.

01:05:25.844 --> 01:05:29.746
Right now, we gotta deal
with the present.

01:05:29.748 --> 01:05:34.319
Wow! My own Rex Vest?

01:05:34.321 --> 01:05:36.788
Thanks for helping me change
for the tougher.

01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:38.792
Don't thank me,
thank yourself.

01:05:39.759 --> 01:05:42.263
Catch you on the flip. Hey-yo!

01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:46.498
Uh-oh.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.766
Ugh! I left my lasso in there!

01:05:48.768 --> 01:05:52.906
And now presenting
Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi...

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.373
Hey!

01:05:55.375 --> 01:05:56.774
And also Batman.

01:05:56.776 --> 01:05:59.346
Commitment!

01:06:06.152 --> 01:06:08.319
You look beautiful.

01:06:08.321 --> 01:06:09.920
You look stunning.

01:06:09.922 --> 01:06:11.455
You are so right.

01:06:11.457 --> 01:06:13.024
I know this is
a strange thing to say

01:06:13.026 --> 01:06:14.591
to the person
I'm about to marry,

01:06:14.593 --> 01:06:18.163
but I actually think
I really like you.

01:06:18.165 --> 01:06:19.263
Samesies.

01:06:19.265 --> 01:06:20.830
- Totally. Totally.
- Totally.

01:06:20.832 --> 01:06:24.134
And bring it to a merciful end.
Can we start now?

01:06:24.136 --> 01:06:25.402
Supes!

01:06:25.404 --> 01:06:27.471
I'm getting hitched.
Feeling jelly?

01:06:27.473 --> 01:06:28.873
Not at all!

01:06:28.875 --> 01:06:31.576
Oh, it's burning
you up inside.

01:06:31.578 --> 01:06:34.078
You don't
understand who the queen is

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.547
and what we're trying to do.

01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:38.584
She's trying to
attack us, obviously.

01:06:39.453 --> 01:06:41.088
You attacked us!

01:06:42.022 --> 01:06:44.022
No, you started it.

01:06:44.024 --> 01:06:45.957
No, you started it.

01:06:50.196 --> 01:06:51.696
Well, now I'm gonna end it.

01:06:51.698 --> 01:06:53.500
- Hello!
- No!

01:07:08.348 --> 01:07:10.784
Help me. Please.

01:07:12.819 --> 01:07:14.786
Okay, I'm not falling for it.
No. Uh-uh.

01:07:14.788 --> 01:07:15.823
No way.

01:07:20.861 --> 01:07:23.995
Nope. Mmm-mmm.
Nope. Stop.

01:07:23.997 --> 01:07:26.163
Uh-uh. No. Ugh!

01:07:26.165 --> 01:07:28.535
No, I will not care about...

01:07:49.056 --> 01:07:50.455
You do care.

01:07:50.457 --> 01:07:52.857
I knew there was some
sweetness under that darkness.

01:07:52.859 --> 01:07:55.125
What are you talking about?
You're the bad guys, okay?

01:07:55.127 --> 01:07:58.062
Maybe in your world.
But here, we don't see it that way.

01:07:58.064 --> 01:07:59.598
Okay, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.498
Your whole costume and mask

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:04.703
and all the stomping around acting
like you're the boss of us...

01:08:04.705 --> 01:08:06.937
Because it's the only way
you'll listen!

01:08:06.939 --> 01:08:09.073
I tried to wear a mask
and talk tough,

01:08:09.075 --> 01:08:12.544
a language I thought you'd understand,
and it totally did not work.

01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:14.879
All we wanna do is
unite our worlds in peace.

01:08:14.881 --> 01:08:16.380
Why didn't you guys
just tell us that?

01:08:16.381 --> 01:08:18.015
We tried.

01:08:18.017 --> 01:08:20.250
The queen sang a whole song
about how not evil she was.

01:08:20.252 --> 01:08:21.786
That was the truth?

01:08:21.787 --> 01:08:23.953
You guys
are terrible communicators.

01:08:23.956 --> 01:08:25.589
I know.

01:08:25.591 --> 01:08:27.158
Come with me.

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.526
For years, we've tried to join
you, to play with you.

01:08:29.528 --> 01:08:32.563
<i>But you've always
pushed us away.</i>

01:08:32.564 --> 01:08:37.134
<i>Now all of our fighting has brought
us to the brink of Armamageddon.</i>

01:08:37.136 --> 01:08:39.069
But this wedding
can change all that.

01:08:39.072 --> 01:08:42.439
Bring us together
and stop Armamageddon.

01:08:42.442 --> 01:08:44.308
It'll make
everything awesome again.

01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:48.312
But everything isn't awesome,
it's, it's, uh...

01:08:49.514 --> 01:08:51.281
And now,

01:08:51.283 --> 01:08:54.587
the queen will change
into her original form.

01:09:06.166 --> 01:09:08.499
See? Friends.

01:09:08.501 --> 01:09:09.870
Ooh!

01:09:13.139 --> 01:09:15.106
The queen was from Emmet.

01:09:15.108 --> 01:09:18.075
Those bricks
inspired our world.

01:09:18.077 --> 01:09:20.276
We exist because of you.

01:09:20.278 --> 01:09:22.011
You started it.

01:09:22.014 --> 01:09:23.647
We started it?

01:09:23.649 --> 01:09:25.515
You started everything.

01:09:25.518 --> 01:09:28.220
We look up to you.
Always have.

01:09:29.622 --> 01:09:30.754
Wyldstyle!

01:09:30.756 --> 01:09:32.557
Where have you been?

01:09:32.559 --> 01:09:34.225
Oh, you guys aren't brainwashed?

01:09:34.228 --> 01:09:35.893
Brainwashed? No!

01:09:35.895 --> 01:09:38.328
We're just happy.
It's so much more fun here.

01:09:38.331 --> 01:09:41.198
There are so many more
spaceships on this adventure!

01:09:41.201 --> 01:09:43.033
And yet not nearly enough.

01:09:43.035 --> 01:09:46.572
Wait, if you guys are good,
then who's the bad guy?

01:09:48.707 --> 01:09:51.575
Stubble Trouble,
this is Alpha Wolf-Bro Dog.

01:09:51.577 --> 01:09:53.777
I'm almost
in Rextraction position.

01:09:53.779 --> 01:09:55.311
<i>What's the color
on the ground?</i>

01:09:55.313 --> 01:09:56.681
Fuchsia.

01:09:56.683 --> 01:09:57.949
Rex, I see Lucy.

01:09:57.951 --> 01:09:59.984
But she isn't taking down
the shields.

01:09:59.986 --> 01:10:02.286
<i>You don't need Lucy.
You don't need anyone.</i>

01:10:02.288 --> 01:10:05.557
If you focus,
you can make a punch so powerful,

01:10:05.559 --> 01:10:07.924
you'll take it down,
shields and all.

01:10:07.926 --> 01:10:10.427
<i>You've got the power
inside you.</i>

01:10:10.429 --> 01:10:12.829
I can do this. I can do this.

01:10:12.831 --> 01:10:16.034
I can't not do this.

01:10:16.036 --> 01:10:18.235
So glad you aren't gonna
destroy this ceremony.

01:10:18.237 --> 01:10:20.871
If anything bad were to
happen, we'd all be doomed.

01:10:20.873 --> 01:10:23.309
But luckily, there's nothing
to worry about now.

01:10:24.277 --> 01:10:25.677
Oh, no.

01:10:25.679 --> 01:10:26.880
Emmet.

01:10:35.587 --> 01:10:37.254
- Emmet!
- Lucy, what are you doing?

01:10:37.256 --> 01:10:39.390
Did you draw stubble dots
on your face?

01:10:39.392 --> 01:10:40.991
What? No.

01:10:40.993 --> 01:10:43.393
Listen to me.
I was wrong about the queen.

01:10:43.395 --> 01:10:44.861
No. No, no, no.

01:10:44.863 --> 01:10:47.030
- Rex was right about you.
- No, you can't do this.

01:10:47.032 --> 01:10:48.833
You're just stopping me
because you're brainwashed.

01:10:48.835 --> 01:10:50.368
I'm not brainwashed!

01:10:50.370 --> 01:10:51.834
That's exactly what a
brainwashed person would say.

01:10:51.836 --> 01:10:53.469
Ahoy, Emmet.

01:10:53.471 --> 01:10:54.672
What happened to you?

01:10:54.674 --> 01:10:57.107
A betoughening, it seems.

01:10:57.109 --> 01:10:59.110
Do you, Queen Watevra,

01:10:59.112 --> 01:11:02.112
take Batman to be your
special best partner?

01:11:02.114 --> 01:11:03.213
I do.

01:11:03.215 --> 01:11:05.783
Hurry up, kid,
we're running outta time.

01:11:05.785 --> 01:11:07.317
Guys, get out of my way.

01:11:07.319 --> 01:11:09.853
If you want to do harm
to yon wedding,

01:11:09.855 --> 01:11:12.856
you will have to
get by we first.

01:11:12.858 --> 01:11:15.325
I'm sorry,
but this is for your own good.

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:22.466
Emmet! Come back!

01:11:25.138 --> 01:11:26.103
Don't do this.

01:11:26.105 --> 01:11:28.204
<i>Don't listen to her!</i>

01:11:28.206 --> 01:11:29.339
Almost there...

01:11:29.341 --> 01:11:31.612
Oh, come on! No!
Not all the way down!

01:11:32.711 --> 01:11:33.945
Stop, Ems.

01:11:33.947 --> 01:11:36.547
You don't know
what you're doing!

01:11:36.549 --> 01:11:37.847
This isn't the real you.

01:11:37.849 --> 01:11:40.484
This is the real me.

01:11:40.486 --> 01:11:43.987
The truth is, this is my real hair.

01:11:43.989 --> 01:11:46.824
I used to sing and dance
and have colorful hair.

01:11:46.826 --> 01:11:49.694
And I even loved
"Everything Is Awesome."

01:11:49.696 --> 01:11:51.161
No, no. You would've told me.

01:11:51.163 --> 01:11:53.298
You hate that music.
It isn't you.

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:55.566
Yes, I darkened my hair
with marker,

01:11:55.568 --> 01:11:58.369
'cause I wanted people to
think I was cool and grown up.

01:11:58.371 --> 01:12:00.838
And then I tried to change you
into someone tough, too.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:04.874
And I was wrong.
I like you the way you were.

01:12:04.876 --> 01:12:07.913
Sweet, innocent, kind.

01:12:09.315 --> 01:12:12.184
The real Lucy
would never say that.

01:12:14.754 --> 01:12:16.420
Do you, Batman,

01:12:16.422 --> 01:12:18.088
take Queen Watevra

01:12:18.090 --> 01:12:19.990
to be your special best partner?

01:12:19.992 --> 01:12:21.959
I do, uh...

01:12:21.961 --> 01:12:24.164
Emmet!

01:12:44.783 --> 01:12:47.518
What's happening?
What did I just do?

01:12:49.322 --> 01:12:50.357
Lucy!

01:12:52.090 --> 01:12:54.024
- Come with me.
- I got you, brother.

01:12:54.026 --> 01:12:56.460
Wait!

01:12:56.462 --> 01:12:57.728
Emmet.

01:12:57.730 --> 01:12:59.131
Lucy!

01:13:12.578 --> 01:13:14.281
<i>What's happening?</i>

01:13:15.982 --> 01:13:17.884
<i>Where am I? What...</i>

01:13:22.154 --> 01:13:24.489
You shouldn't take my stuff!

01:13:24.491 --> 01:13:28.392
You crushed
my space laser cake thingy!

01:13:28.394 --> 01:13:30.030
<i>Emmet?</i>

01:13:33.032 --> 01:13:34.731
Rex, why are we leaving?

01:13:34.733 --> 01:13:36.467
We gotta save my friends.

01:13:36.469 --> 01:13:39.203
Do we? They didn't come to
save us when we were all alone.

01:13:39.205 --> 01:13:42.138
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:44.275
Look a little closer.
We're not so different.

01:13:44.277 --> 01:13:45.209
What, you and I?

01:13:45.211 --> 01:13:46.944
- We and us.
- Huh?

01:13:46.946 --> 01:13:49.379
Emmet, I'm you.

01:13:49.381 --> 01:13:50.914
But I'm me.

01:13:50.916 --> 01:13:54.418
I'm you from the future,
all grown up.

01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:58.388
Wait, if you're me,
why do we sound so different?

01:13:58.390 --> 01:14:00.191
Why do we sound so different?

01:14:01.661 --> 01:14:03.194
It's a mind-blower, I know.

01:14:03.196 --> 01:14:05.896
That's why I was so cagey
in telling you my backstory.

01:14:05.898 --> 01:14:07.365
Actually, you kept
bringing it up.

01:14:07.367 --> 01:14:09.600
There I was, you.

01:14:09.602 --> 01:14:12.669
<i>In that little house-ship,
trying to make it through the Stairgate.</i>

01:14:13.907 --> 01:14:16.274
This is the end!

01:14:18.111 --> 01:14:21.712
<i>There was no handsome,
older version of myself to save me.</i>

01:14:21.714 --> 01:14:23.246
Where's Emmet?

01:14:23.248 --> 01:14:24.448
Honey,
I'm on my way out the door,

01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:26.150
but the kids are fighting.
Bye!

01:14:26.152 --> 01:14:28.686
Guys! Please,
find a way to play together,

01:14:28.688 --> 01:14:31.054
or I'm gonna have to ask you
to put it all into storage.

01:14:31.056 --> 01:14:32.623
- But, Mom...
- No buts.

01:14:32.625 --> 01:14:34.959
This is the last time.

01:14:34.961 --> 01:14:37.063
<i>Help! Anyone?</i>

01:14:37.663 --> 01:14:39.195
<i>Hello?</i>

01:14:39.197 --> 01:14:41.865
<i>No one heard me.
No one came for me.</i>

01:14:41.867 --> 01:14:44.067
<i>I was left behind. Forgotten.</i>

01:14:44.069 --> 01:14:47.271
<i>While the rest of my so-called
friends danced and sang</i>

01:14:47.273 --> 01:14:49.943
<i>at the hands of a monster.</i>

01:14:52.679 --> 01:14:56.414
<i>What could I have done
to avoid such a fate?</i>

01:14:56.416 --> 01:14:59.049
<i>We also have
to grow up sometime.</i>

01:14:59.051 --> 01:15:02.352
<i>Wyldstyle said
you're not tough enough to do this.</i>

01:15:02.354 --> 01:15:04.888
<i>This guy was a fierce warrior?</i>

01:15:04.890 --> 01:15:07.825
<i>Yeah, dude,
you're a total Hufflepuff.</i>

01:15:09.996 --> 01:15:13.731
<i>I was alone with nothing</i>

01:15:13.733 --> 01:15:15.199
<i>but anger.</i>

01:15:15.201 --> 01:15:18.235
<i>But anger was the key
to my freedom.</i>

01:15:24.376 --> 01:15:30.149
<i>It was time for me
to take a stand.</i>

01:15:34.754 --> 01:15:36.420
<i>I was real.</i>

01:15:36.422 --> 01:15:39.492
<i>I was no longer the
naive Emmet I used to be.</i>

01:15:42.127 --> 01:15:45.495
<i>I got myself a new vest,
a new head of hair,</i>

01:15:45.497 --> 01:15:49.499
<i>and a petulant attitude
towards everything that's lame.</i>

01:15:49.501 --> 01:15:52.203
<i>I gave myself a makeover
and became Rex.</i>

01:15:52.205 --> 01:15:55.172
<i>Radical Emmet Xtreme.</i>

01:15:55.174 --> 01:15:59.511
<i>I was all grown up,
but I still wasn't free.</i>

01:16:02.214 --> 01:16:04.449
<i>I knew the only way
to move past it</i>

01:16:04.451 --> 01:16:07.352
<i>was to make sure it never
happened in the first place.</i>

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:08.886
It's a dance party!

01:16:08.888 --> 01:16:10.487
<i>And then I saw a way</i>

01:16:10.489 --> 01:16:14.057
<i>to undo all the unbearable
pain I'd experienced</i>

01:16:14.059 --> 01:16:16.994
<i>in one convoluted move...</i>

01:16:16.996 --> 01:16:19.295
<i>Called time travel.</i>

01:16:19.297 --> 01:16:21.498
Sorry, Doc,
gonna need your DeLorean.

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:24.101
And, Bill, Ted,
your phone booth.

01:16:24.103 --> 01:16:26.169
Doctor Who's TARDIS.
H.G. Wells' bicycle thing.

01:16:26.171 --> 01:16:27.471
Whatever Skynet's been using.

01:16:27.473 --> 01:16:29.073
And this hot tub.

01:16:29.075 --> 01:16:30.740
<i>I built a time-traveling
spaceship</i>

01:16:30.742 --> 01:16:32.978
<i>and blasted into the past.</i>

01:16:36.148 --> 01:16:37.684
<i>I picked up a crew.</i>

01:16:41.621 --> 01:16:43.553
<i>Then I traveled
to the moment right before</i>

01:16:43.555 --> 01:16:48.694
<i>I was thrown into the cold,
dark truth of the world.</i>

01:16:54.567 --> 01:16:58.171
<i>And I found the one person
I wanted to protect.</i>

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.274
- Whoa!
- <i>Me.</i>

01:17:03.643 --> 01:17:05.709
I was following everything you
said, except for...

01:17:05.711 --> 01:17:09.148
Everything after the part
where you said, "I'm you."

01:17:10.448 --> 01:17:12.652
Literally the first thing
I said.

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:16.152
This time travel stuff's
always kinda confusing.

01:17:16.154 --> 01:17:17.454
It's best just to go with it.

01:17:17.456 --> 01:17:19.390
You tricked me
into hurting my friends?

01:17:19.392 --> 01:17:23.192
I didn't trick you.
I taught you to harden your heart,

01:17:23.194 --> 01:17:24.962
just like you asked me to.

01:17:24.964 --> 01:17:26.830
What did you make me do?

01:17:26.832 --> 01:17:30.267
What exactly is Armamageddon?

01:17:30.269 --> 01:17:33.904
You stole my guys.

01:17:33.906 --> 01:17:35.039
This is your fault.

01:17:35.041 --> 01:17:36.473
What's going on up here?

01:17:36.475 --> 01:17:38.575
She took my guys
and she ruined them.

01:17:38.577 --> 01:17:40.777
All right, all right!

01:17:40.779 --> 01:17:43.079
<i>Armamageddon.</i>

01:17:43.081 --> 01:17:45.883
<i>Our-mama-gets-in?</i>

01:17:45.885 --> 01:17:47.852
<i>Okay. Really?</i>

01:17:47.854 --> 01:17:49.686
Guys.

01:17:49.688 --> 01:17:52.789
I know I said it was the last
time, the last time,

01:17:52.791 --> 01:17:54.725
and the time before that.

01:17:54.727 --> 01:17:56.927
But this is the last...

01:17:56.929 --> 01:17:58.163
Last time.

01:17:59.165 --> 01:18:00.763
I need...

01:18:00.765 --> 01:18:02.134
I stepped on a brick.

01:18:03.402 --> 01:18:05.002
I'm just...

01:18:05.004 --> 01:18:09.005
I'm doing breathing,
so that it takes the pain away.

01:18:09.007 --> 01:18:11.208
I need...

01:18:13.645 --> 01:18:15.945
Close to childbirth.

01:18:15.947 --> 01:18:19.450
Very close in pain level to childbirth.

01:18:19.452 --> 01:18:21.252
You guys
know the consequences.

01:18:21.254 --> 01:18:23.553
I need you guys to put
all the bricks into storage.

01:18:23.555 --> 01:18:25.489
<i>The Bin of Storajj.</i>

01:18:25.491 --> 01:18:27.257
- No, no, no, Mom, please.
- Please, please. One more chance.

01:18:27.259 --> 01:18:29.159
Finn, I want you
to go downstairs

01:18:29.161 --> 01:18:32.429
and put away your
dystopian wasteland thing.

01:18:32.431 --> 01:18:35.132
- It's Apocalypseburg.
- I don't care what it's called.

01:18:35.134 --> 01:18:37.133
Bianca, I need you
to clean up here.

01:18:37.135 --> 01:18:38.602
Mom, it's not fair.

01:18:38.604 --> 01:18:40.237
Look, I'm not
the bad guy in this story.

01:18:40.239 --> 01:18:41.972
I'm just an amusing
side character.

01:18:41.974 --> 01:18:43.606
- And you're the one who took my guys.
- How is it my fault?

01:18:43.608 --> 01:18:45.741
Hon, I could really
use your help up here.

01:18:45.743 --> 01:18:49.079
Kids, do the thing...
Uh, what your mother said.

01:18:49.081 --> 01:18:51.684
You heard your father's
super helpful contribution.

01:18:54.853 --> 01:18:56.719
You ruined everything.

01:18:56.721 --> 01:18:59.158
I just wanted you
to play with me.

01:19:05.564 --> 01:19:09.768
<i>Emmet, what have you done?</i>

01:19:11.804 --> 01:19:13.204
What have we done?

01:19:13.206 --> 01:19:14.871
It's called growing up.

01:19:14.873 --> 01:19:16.106
Isn't that what you wanted?

01:19:16.108 --> 01:19:17.975
No. I wanna save my friends.

01:19:17.977 --> 01:19:21.244
You don't have friends.
They're just pieces of plastic.

01:19:21.246 --> 01:19:22.980
You still want to
go back

01:19:22.982 --> 01:19:24.981
- to the Matrix when you know the truth?
- What's the Matrix?

01:19:24.983 --> 01:19:28.151
It's a movie only cool, older,
mature dudes like us have seen.

01:19:28.153 --> 01:19:30.887
It's time to put away
childish things.

01:19:30.889 --> 01:19:32.623
No.

01:19:32.625 --> 01:19:34.356
My friends may not be real to
you, but they're real to me.

01:19:34.358 --> 01:19:36.026
And they're my family.

01:19:36.028 --> 01:19:37.397
I won't give up on 'em.

01:19:41.367 --> 01:19:45.067
I am so disappointed
in myself.

01:19:45.069 --> 01:19:48.204
I guess you're gonna have
to become me the hard way.

01:19:48.206 --> 01:19:50.141
Ain't something
a couple of years

01:19:50.143 --> 01:19:53.777
in Undar of the Dryar System
won't fix.

01:19:53.779 --> 01:19:55.045
No. No, Rex.

01:19:55.047 --> 01:19:56.413
Or me, or you...

01:19:56.415 --> 01:19:59.752
Please, no! No!

01:20:00.252 --> 01:20:01.653
One love.

01:20:03.355 --> 01:20:05.356
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

01:20:17.269 --> 01:20:19.638
<i>It can't be this hopeless,
can it?</i>

01:20:21.541 --> 01:20:23.543
<i>It can.</i>

01:20:40.225 --> 01:20:43.127
It's Armamageddon!

01:20:43.129 --> 01:20:44.460
Look out,
Chainsaw Dave!

01:20:44.462 --> 01:20:47.129
It's Purgatory Dave now! Whoa.

01:20:50.301 --> 01:20:53.473
I had theater tickets
tonight! No!

01:20:56.308 --> 01:20:59.345
No! I was finally valued!

01:21:00.246 --> 01:21:01.978
Cannonball!

01:21:03.815 --> 01:21:07.284
Not gonna slip this time!
Not gonna slip this time!

01:21:07.286 --> 01:21:10.353
I did it! No!

01:21:10.355 --> 01:21:12.688
No! My queen!

01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:14.191
No, no, no!

01:21:14.193 --> 01:21:18.431
No! My queen!
No! Don't leave me!

01:21:19.599 --> 01:21:21.731
My queen!

01:21:26.138 --> 01:21:27.603
<i>No, no! But...</i>

01:21:27.605 --> 01:21:29.809
<i>Stop it! I said stop!</i>

01:21:39.184 --> 01:21:41.321
<i>Can you please,
please help us?</i>

01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:21.261
<i>War hardens the heart.</i>

01:22:33.272 --> 01:22:34.972
<i>Wait. What? No!</i>

01:22:34.974 --> 01:22:37.074
This isn't the end!
It can't be.

01:22:37.076 --> 01:22:39.209
This isn't one of those things
with a downer cliffhanger ending.

01:22:39.211 --> 01:22:42.012
Uh-uh. No, no.
This needs to have a happy ending.

01:22:42.014 --> 01:22:43.813
Seems like a downer to me.

01:22:43.815 --> 01:22:47.183
And so it ends for Batman,
the way it began.

01:22:47.185 --> 01:22:48.552
In darkness.

01:22:48.554 --> 01:22:50.286
Hey, uh, Supes.

01:22:50.288 --> 01:22:52.455
You're, uh, pressed against me.
It's no rush or anything.

01:22:52.457 --> 01:22:54.959
No! No, no, no!
It's only over if we give up.

01:22:54.961 --> 01:22:56.727
Well, it's over
and we're giving up.

01:22:56.729 --> 01:22:58.862
We can get out of here
if we all rally together.

01:22:58.864 --> 01:23:00.597
No. It's too late.

01:23:00.599 --> 01:23:05.668

mature, sad song as we fade to black.

I like your
"Stop Rex" plan, Lucy.

01:27:50.355 --> 01:27:52.955
One small question, who's Rex?

01:27:52.957 --> 01:27:54.258
This is gonna sound crazy,

01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:55.758
but I think
he's a version of Emmet

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.293
from the future
that I wanted him to be,

01:27:57.295 --> 01:27:59.195
but he turned out
to be a real jerk.

01:27:59.197 --> 01:28:01.698
That's a really
cute speech, Emmet,

01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:04.069
but actions speak louder
than words.

01:28:05.170 --> 01:28:07.038
Yes, they do.

01:28:15.246 --> 01:28:19.015

me and you can't stop them.

01:28:20.586 --> 01:28:22.319

Don't let them near the Dryar System.
Copy? Over.

01:28:26.657 --> 01:28:27.993
Uh-oh.

01:28:29.193 --> 01:28:30.093
Now, Unikitty!

01:28:30.095 --> 01:28:33.629
Glitter hairball missiles, go!

01:28:43.474 --> 01:28:44.977
Spaceships!

01:28:46.611 --> 01:28:48.844
Spaceship!

01:28:48.846 --> 01:28:52.251
Fire the sprinkle cannon!
You lollygagging lizards!

01:28:55.019 --> 01:28:57.253
No! I'm not gonna
lose you again!

01:28:57.255 --> 01:28:58.387
I'm saving you.

01:28:58.389 --> 01:28:59.722
I'm saving you.

01:28:59.724 --> 01:29:01.158
I'm sacrificing myself
for you!

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:02.959
I'm sacrificing myself.

01:29:02.961 --> 01:29:04.293
- I am.
- I am.

01:29:04.295 --> 01:29:05.795
- I am!
- I am!

01:29:05.797 --> 01:29:07.433
You know what?
I actually like this now.

01:29:08.634 --> 01:29:10.033
This isn't
even happening.

01:29:10.035 --> 01:29:11.901
It's all just the expression

01:29:11.903 --> 01:29:16.005
of the death of imagination in
the subconscious of an adolescent!

01:29:16.007 --> 01:29:19.676
Ow! I don't even understand
what you're saying!

01:29:19.678 --> 01:29:21.878
Don't worry.
You don't have to.

01:29:24.183 --> 01:29:25.649
We're surrounded!

01:29:25.651 --> 01:29:26.950
We can't go any further!

01:29:26.952 --> 01:29:28.252
I'm not giving up!

01:29:28.254 --> 01:29:29.321
You won't make it! No!

01:29:37.429 --> 01:29:41.530
Guess your so-called friends
didn't save you after all.

01:29:45.670 --> 01:29:47.236
Oh, yeah?

01:29:47.238 --> 01:29:50.108
- Huh?
- Who you calling "so-called"?

01:29:57.882 --> 01:30:00.019
Lucy! You saved me!

01:30:00.852 --> 01:30:03.022
You came back for him.

01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:08.158
Well, you're too late.

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:12.762
I'm just gonna keep going back in
time until I get this thing right.

01:30:12.764 --> 01:30:14.798
Heart attack!

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:24.042
Goodbye!

01:30:34.853 --> 01:30:36.052
It's over, Rex.

01:30:36.054 --> 01:30:38.123
Emmet's never going to be you.

01:30:40.492 --> 01:30:42.692
But you can be like him.

01:30:42.694 --> 01:30:45.329
You don't have to be
the bad guy.

01:30:45.331 --> 01:30:46.364
You can join us.

01:30:48.233 --> 01:30:49.665
I can't.

01:30:49.667 --> 01:30:51.868
What do you mean?

01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:53.770
She came back for you.

01:30:53.772 --> 01:30:57.443
You're never going to turn out like
me, which means...

01:30:58.510 --> 01:31:00.877
I'm never going to exist.

01:31:00.879 --> 01:31:02.611
Wait. Wait, no.

01:31:02.613 --> 01:31:04.914
Look! I knew it!
Look, I'm <i>Back To The Futuring!</i>

01:31:04.916 --> 01:31:06.082
Totally called it.

01:31:06.084 --> 01:31:07.450
What's <i>Back To The Futuring?</i>

01:31:07.452 --> 01:31:10.253
It's a classic movie
older kids get to watch.

01:31:10.255 --> 01:31:12.621
And now it's happening to me.

01:31:12.623 --> 01:31:15.795
Come on! Take our hand,
while you still have a hand to take!

01:31:17.129 --> 01:31:19.295
That ain't how it works, kid.

01:31:19.297 --> 01:31:20.731
Rex...

01:31:20.733 --> 01:31:21.897
It's okay.

01:31:21.899 --> 01:31:23.333
I'm proud of ya.

01:31:23.335 --> 01:31:26.869
And you're gonna grow up
to be better than me.

01:31:26.871 --> 01:31:31.374
But kind of thanks to me,
so I'm also great.

01:31:31.376 --> 01:31:35.645
And, Lucy,
thanks for coming back for us.

01:31:35.647 --> 01:31:38.448
Besides, this is a pretty
righteous way to go out!

01:31:38.450 --> 01:31:39.682
No regrets!

01:31:39.684 --> 01:31:41.217
Except, again,
not trademarking "no regrets."

01:31:41.219 --> 01:31:43.022
That was a mistake. One love.

01:31:45.857 --> 01:31:49.226
Just to be clear, that really happened.
You could see him, right?

01:31:49.228 --> 01:31:51.564
- Uh-huh. Time to go?
- Yeah.

01:31:52.831 --> 01:31:54.164
Hey, um...

01:31:54.166 --> 01:31:56.667
I'm really sorry
I tried to change you.

01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:58.802
Oh, I'm sorry I blew up the
wedding and almost banished everyone

01:31:58.804 --> 01:32:01.503
to an eternity of lifelessness
in a cosmic storage bin.

01:32:01.505 --> 01:32:02.838
It's fine.

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:04.473
Can we be
special best friends still?

01:32:04.475 --> 01:32:05.510
Fo' eva.

01:32:16.955 --> 01:32:18.887
Hey! Hey!

01:32:18.889 --> 01:32:22.225
Pony's at the dance party.
"What kind of dance party is this?"

01:32:22.227 --> 01:32:24.125
In there! Do not!

01:32:24.127 --> 01:32:26.061
Oh! We're going down!

01:32:26.063 --> 01:32:27.496
It's eating the queen!

01:32:27.498 --> 01:32:29.167
Honey, where are my pants?

01:32:30.903 --> 01:32:32.104
Take off!

01:32:46.652 --> 01:32:49.654
Good morning,
Syspocalypstar.

01:32:53.125 --> 01:32:54.924
Good morning, sparkle babies!

01:32:54.926 --> 01:32:56.758
Hello!

01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:58.460
Let's switch helmets.

01:32:58.462 --> 01:33:02.198
This
makes my voice sound awesome.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:04.668
Scarfield, Deathface,
MetalScratch...

01:33:04.670 --> 01:33:06.203
Ripley, Connor, the other one.

01:33:06.205 --> 01:33:07.904
Wait a minute. Where's Jeff?

01:33:07.906 --> 01:33:09.505
Meow.

01:33:13.211 --> 01:33:16.379
Guys, hold on! Hold on!
Hold on! Terrible news!

01:33:16.381 --> 01:33:19.915
I missed a gimme putt
for birdie on seven.

01:33:19.917 --> 01:33:23.619
Anyway, you fix everything that
was going on? All the crazy stuff?

01:33:23.621 --> 01:33:25.221
Spaceship!

01:33:25.223 --> 01:33:26.625
Hot! Hot! Hot! Uh-oh.

01:33:33.130 --> 01:33:35.132
- Yay!
- Yeah!

01:33:35.134 --> 01:33:36.935
I've got a surprise for you.

01:33:40.471 --> 01:33:41.639

01:33:47.345 --> 01:33:48.544
Planty!

01:33:48.546 --> 01:33:50.581
An original album

01:33:51.849 --> 01:33:53.883
