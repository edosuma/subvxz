00:00.445 --> 00:02.186
Previously on,<i> The Arrangement...</i>

00:02.187 --> 00:03.787
This role will elevate you,

00:03.856 --> 00:05.088
but we have to fight for it.

00:05.157 --> 00:08.025
June, your story needs to be told by women.

00:08.093 --> 00:09.669
I hope you make a strong bid.

00:09.670 --> 00:11.216
I'm introducing something new.

00:11.217 --> 00:13.617
It's called Vita, it's
IHM's life extension program.

00:14.147 --> 00:16.219
Aaron! Julie!

00:16.457 --> 00:17.656
<i>Aaron and Julie are gone.</i>

00:17.724 --> 00:19.357
Shit, Terence.

00:19.426 --> 00:21.293
I swear to you, I didn't tell him anything.

00:21.361 --> 00:23.762
That is so pathetic that
I would actually think

00:23.831 --> 00:25.197
that you would choose me over him.

00:25.265 --> 00:26.932
We're getting married tomorrow!

00:27.000 --> 00:28.443
We're gonna have to figure
out what to do about her.

00:28.635 --> 00:29.935
What did you have in mind?

00:30.003 --> 00:31.919
I think we're gonna need
a more permanent solution.

00:32.326 --> 00:34.292
It's over. Terence has them.

00:34.361 --> 00:36.161
What? No, Kyle wouldn't let that happen.

00:36.230 --> 00:37.896
Yeah, who knows what Kyle would do.

00:56.650 --> 00:57.746
Hey.

01:01.021 --> 01:02.246
Listen, last night,

01:02.489 --> 01:05.233
whatever it was for you... An escape, or...

01:06.193 --> 01:07.384
It's fine with me.

01:08.362 --> 01:09.995
And you don't wanna talk
about what's going on...

01:10.063 --> 01:11.182
I get that too.

01:12.266 --> 01:13.968
I just wanna know you're okay.

01:18.105 --> 01:20.238
I was hoping I'd wake
up to a different life.

01:22.476 --> 01:24.060
Something simpler.

01:26.079 --> 01:28.340
You know, I got this
Midwest tour coming up.

01:28.749 --> 01:31.180
Life is simpler out there, slower.

01:31.618 --> 01:32.961
Any chance you're leaving for that tour

01:32.986 --> 01:35.333
in the next eight hours?

01:36.556 --> 01:37.946
What happens in eight hours?

01:38.525 --> 01:40.200
The wedding.

01:41.428 --> 01:42.661
Your wedding, Megan?

01:43.058 --> 01:44.524
Look, it's a long story.

01:44.593 --> 01:46.031
You gotta tell me what's going on.

01:46.032 --> 01:48.566
Did Kyle do something to you?
Because that's unacceptable.

01:48.635 --> 01:52.537
No, he... he didn't do
anything to me directly,

01:52.606 --> 01:53.990
but the whole thing is just

01:54.611 --> 01:56.245
a nightmare.

01:56.926 --> 01:58.776
And there's nothing I could do about it.

02:01.797 --> 02:02.904
I have to go.

02:03.795 --> 02:05.362
Go where? Back?

02:07.541 --> 02:09.118
I don't have a choice.

02:10.455 --> 02:11.902
You always have a choice.

02:16.141 --> 02:17.225
Megan?

02:25.465 --> 02:26.692
There she is.

02:28.122 --> 02:29.725
Okay, stay close where I can see you.

02:30.148 --> 02:31.180
Stay alert.

02:31.205 --> 02:32.301
Definitely.

02:42.703 --> 02:43.893
Smart...

02:44.088 --> 02:47.312
A public place, a friend.

02:47.758 --> 02:48.858
And my own protection,

02:48.920 --> 02:51.646
in case someone thinks they're
gonna put a bag over my head.

02:52.082 --> 02:53.689
I'm here to help you...

02:53.690 --> 02:55.263
Really help,

02:55.419 --> 02:56.936
before you screw this whole thing up

02:56.961 --> 02:58.230
more than you already have.

02:58.231 --> 02:59.381
Forget it.

02:59.736 --> 03:00.830
Wait.

03:00.899 --> 03:02.365
Oh, my God, Xavier Hughes.

03:02.434 --> 03:04.334
Holy shit, I love you so much!

03:04.402 --> 03:05.899
- Can we take a picture?
- Uh, yeah.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.303
You have no power.

03:07.602 --> 03:09.606
You lost it when you lost Aaron and Julie,

03:09.931 --> 03:12.813
and that's a problem
because Terence is furious.

03:14.427 --> 03:15.708
Did he kill them?

03:16.349 --> 03:18.014
I don't know what he's done.

03:18.310 --> 03:20.176
He doesn't tell you, or you don't ask?

03:20.245 --> 03:22.763
They're gone, one way or the other.

03:23.406 --> 03:26.033
I wanna make sure the same
thing doesn't happen to you.

03:26.446 --> 03:27.884
I don't know why I should trust you.

03:27.953 --> 03:29.786
Megan, you have nowhere to run.

03:29.855 --> 03:31.788
Kyle can't protect you, you know this,

03:31.857 --> 03:33.056
otherwise you wouldn't have come here.

03:33.124 --> 03:34.791
What's your point, that I'm desperate?

03:34.860 --> 03:36.192
That's not an answer that helps me.

03:39.764 --> 03:41.831
Did you ever ask yourself
how a nobody-waitress

03:41.900 --> 03:44.065
got an audition to be in
a movie with Kyle West?

03:46.645 --> 03:48.111
Leslie got it for me.

03:49.099 --> 03:51.422
No. I did.

03:52.681 --> 03:55.090
I arranged everything.

03:56.952 --> 03:59.030
I bet the future on you, Megan,

03:59.855 --> 04:02.194
and I am not willing to lose.

Please stop pacing.

04:21.942 --> 04:23.242
What?

04:23.718 --> 04:25.952
It's wasted energy. It
accomplishes nothing.

04:26.196 --> 04:27.845
What are you accomplishing right now?

04:28.291 --> 04:29.575
I have faith in DeAnn.

04:29.725 --> 04:31.258
You know, we were gonna convince

04:31.327 --> 04:32.850
Aaron and Julie not to go public?

04:33.546 --> 04:34.881
You didn't have to take them,

04:35.097 --> 04:36.822
and Megan would be here right now.

04:37.066 --> 04:38.300
How'd you find them?

04:39.035 --> 04:41.001
I'm not gonna trust you with
information about the Woolths.

04:41.026 --> 04:42.146
You understand why.

04:42.171 --> 04:43.637
And you understand that
I had to make a choice.

04:43.724 --> 04:45.023
There were circumstances.

04:45.303 --> 04:46.636
I wasn't trying to betray you.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.348
I know. The only person you
betrayed the other night was you.

04:50.442 --> 04:51.453
Okay.

04:51.799 --> 04:53.699
Better and lesser selves, my friend.

04:53.979 --> 04:56.465
When you chose Megan, you chose the lesser.

04:56.815 --> 04:58.915
The lesser? Are you kidding me right now?

04:58.984 --> 05:01.241
Kyle, she took off the
night before your wedding.

05:01.753 --> 05:03.086
How does it not occur to you

05:03.154 --> 05:04.617
that maybe you made the wrong choice?

05:04.856 --> 05:06.689
Because I know who she really is.

05:06.758 --> 05:08.681
No, I don't think you do.

05:09.728 --> 05:11.878
You want proof that you're worthy of love,

05:12.896 --> 05:13.978
and you are.

05:14.432 --> 05:16.381
You don't need her. You don't need anybody.

05:17.675 --> 05:18.954
She's here.

05:19.204 --> 05:20.403
Where? I wanna see her.

05:20.472 --> 05:22.431
No, no, no, that would be bad luck.

05:22.982 --> 05:24.407
Go get yourself dressed.

05:24.408 --> 05:26.139
You'll see her when she
walks down the aisle.

05:27.131 --> 05:28.435
How is she?

05:29.251 --> 05:30.976
You're getting married today.

05:31.891 --> 05:32.855
Go.

05:35.402 --> 05:36.735
Thanks for the talk, bud.

05:42.173 --> 05:43.439
What kind of shape is she in?

05:43.728 --> 05:45.144
She's in one piece.

05:45.673 --> 05:48.614
I did a lot of... cajoling.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.203
But she bought it?

05:51.528 --> 05:52.770
She's here.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.700
She was with Xavier Hughes.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.772
Jesus Christ.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.426
What does he know?

06:01.495 --> 06:02.872
According to her, nothing important.

06:02.873 --> 06:04.477
Oh, well, we should definitely
take her word for it.

06:06.281 --> 06:07.870
I just wanna get through this.

06:08.787 --> 06:10.445
Terence, I get that you're angry.

06:10.514 --> 06:11.613
I'm angry too.

06:12.248 --> 06:14.927
But you need to do more than
just get through this wedding.

06:16.386 --> 06:17.996
You need to make it great.

06:23.029 --> 06:24.708
<i>We're here to tell a love story.</i>

06:26.296 --> 06:27.644
<i>A story of two souls,</i>

06:28.987 --> 06:30.650
<i>neither with families of their own,</i>

06:31.171 --> 06:33.160
<i>who roam the Earth in search of something</i>

06:33.161 --> 06:35.037
<i>they could not name, nor describe.</i>

06:35.497 --> 06:37.041
<i>They'd never actually seen it,</i>

06:37.199 --> 06:39.653
<i>but each knew it was there, somewhere,</i>

06:41.036 --> 06:42.227
<i>waiting for them.</i>

06:43.197 --> 06:45.668
<i>They both suffered and lost hope,</i>

06:46.775 --> 06:48.470
<i>but grew stronger with each setback</i>

06:49.472 --> 06:51.002
<i>until both were so strong</i>

06:51.326 --> 06:53.532
<i>they could not help but see each other.</i>

06:58.370 --> 06:59.526
<i>And finally,</i>

06:59.888 --> 07:01.992
<i>that unknown thing they
had both been searching for</i>

07:02.715 --> 07:04.280
<i>was staring back at them...</i>

07:05.360 --> 07:06.638
<i>Intimacy,</i>

07:07.362 --> 07:09.069
<i>truth, home,</i>

07:09.498 --> 07:11.924
<i>family, consciousness.</i>

07:16.071 --> 07:17.604
<i>As Kyle and Megan start their family today,</i>

07:18.078 --> 07:20.282
<i>we are blessed to have
them at the core of ours,</i>

07:21.810 --> 07:23.910
because their love story
inspires us to strive

07:23.979 --> 07:25.751
for something greater than ourselves...

07:26.748 --> 07:27.919
Something higher.

07:29.851 --> 07:31.097
These rings

07:31.787 --> 07:33.699
are a symbol of your discovery,

07:33.989 --> 07:35.732
and a reminder that your
quest for fulfillment

07:35.757 --> 07:39.189
does not end here today,
but continues together.

08:00.643 --> 08:01.736
Kyle,

08:01.950 --> 08:03.986
do you pledge yourself
to Megan as her husband?

08:04.519 --> 08:06.853
Do you pledge to support
her unconditionally,

08:06.922 --> 08:08.418
to love her without restraint,

08:09.427 --> 08:11.246
through joy and pain,

08:11.907 --> 08:13.799
good fortune and adversity,

08:14.020 --> 08:15.365
for the rest of your life?

08:16.022 --> 08:17.207
I do.

08:31.918 --> 08:33.022
Megan,

08:33.405 --> 08:36.323
do you pledge yourself to Kyle as his wife?

08:36.842 --> 08:39.044
Do you pledge to support
him unconditionally,

08:39.246 --> 08:40.879
to love him without restraint,

08:41.629 --> 08:42.908
in joy and in pain,

08:43.775 --> 08:44.974
good fortune and adversity,

08:45.043 --> 08:46.364
for the rest of your life?

08:47.384 --> 08:48.507
I do.

09:01.993 --> 09:03.645
As we all stand here today,

09:04.228 --> 09:06.267
witness to this moment,

09:07.058 --> 09:08.202
bound together,

09:09.327 --> 09:11.991
I pronounce you husband and wife.

09:13.098 --> 09:14.583
You may kiss.

09:31.684 --> 09:32.910
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

10:40.997 --> 10:42.602
I just wanna say that, um,

10:43.800 --> 10:45.200
I know that we have a lot to work through,

10:45.513 --> 10:47.250
but the fact that you came back

10:47.704 --> 10:49.799
and you wanna do this with me,

10:50.941 --> 10:52.390
it really means a lot.

10:54.778 --> 10:55.883
Kyle...

10:58.648 --> 11:00.449
I came back for the wedding.

11:01.384 --> 11:03.481
I didn't come back for our relationship.

11:04.003 --> 11:05.124
What?

11:09.991 --> 11:11.515
What are you doing?

11:13.351 --> 11:15.090
Megan, get back in the car.

11:19.635 --> 11:20.744
You okay?

11:21.359 --> 11:22.533
Just drive.

11:25.546 --> 11:26.940
Don't do this.

12:04.378 --> 12:06.456
I'm sorry for the way I left last night.

12:06.650 --> 12:08.377
I needed time to think, and I...

12:09.923 --> 12:10.977
Oh, God.

12:12.202 --> 12:14.402
This was a lot easier when
I rehearsed it in my head.

12:18.542 --> 12:21.096
I know things are weird now, and

12:22.312 --> 12:26.014
it's not how you or either
of us wanted it to be.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.883
But... but we are married,

12:30.754 --> 12:32.187
and there are certain expectations

12:32.255 --> 12:33.547
that come with that.

12:35.058 --> 12:37.563
Which is why I think we
should go on our honeymoon.

12:37.828 --> 12:41.603
And then, when we come back,
I think we should do "Ellen,"

12:42.599 --> 12:45.751
and keep the narrative going
while we figure out the rest.

12:48.605 --> 12:49.939
No more narratives.

12:57.717 --> 12:58.912
What's this?

12:59.282 --> 13:00.412
It's an agreement.

13:00.885 --> 13:02.217
If you sign it, it releases you

13:02.285 --> 13:03.743
from the contract without blame.

13:06.541 --> 13:08.123
You wanna cut me loose?

13:08.191 --> 13:10.148
I wanna take away your obligation.

13:10.711 --> 13:11.980
I love you,

13:12.195 --> 13:14.611
and I just want us to go
back to the way things were,

13:15.098 --> 13:18.266
and we cannot do that
unless you choose to be here.

13:18.335 --> 13:19.719
Kyle.

13:20.937 --> 13:22.857
I thought we can't get
back to what we were?

13:23.874 --> 13:25.428
We have to accept what we are.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.332
What do you think that is?

13:27.711 --> 13:28.875
Kygan.

13:29.913 --> 13:31.943
Hollywood's favorite couple.

13:32.883 --> 13:34.887
It's when we're at our best, so,

13:35.815 --> 13:37.313
let's just be that,

13:37.621 --> 13:39.836
instead of trying to be this other,

13:40.457 --> 13:43.237
magical thing that doesn't work.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.226
So you want this all to be bullshit?

13:45.295 --> 13:47.963
No, not bullshit, an arrangement.

13:49.748 --> 13:51.166
I get the career boost,

13:51.234 --> 13:53.334
and you get the appearance
of a stable personal life.

13:53.403 --> 13:55.336
Isn't that what the
contract was always for?

13:55.405 --> 13:56.864
A fake relationship?

13:57.632 --> 13:59.442
No, no, that's not what it was for.

14:00.010 --> 14:01.980
Megan, we fell in love the day that we met.

14:03.442 --> 14:04.546
We were reading a script.

14:04.614 --> 14:05.980
Megan, it was amazing, you know that.

14:06.049 --> 14:07.716
It was amazing, it was,

14:07.784 --> 14:10.177
and it kept us going for a long time...

14:10.787 --> 14:12.954
But it's... it's just a memory.

14:13.023 --> 14:15.056
It's a... It's a beautiful memory,

14:15.125 --> 14:17.213
but it's not what's actually

14:17.828 --> 14:19.442
standing in front of me.

14:20.325 --> 14:21.961
You were in love with me a week ago.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.129
Please, tell me what happened.

14:23.154 --> 14:24.507
It's not... That's not the point.

14:24.508 --> 14:26.341
No, you know what it is?
You got it in your head

14:26.411 --> 14:28.211
that I gave up Aaron
and Julie and I did not.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.146
And I promise you, I will
find a way to prove it to you.

14:30.215 --> 14:31.883
It doesn't matter anymore, Kyle.

14:32.183 --> 14:34.182
There have been so many lies

14:34.207 --> 14:36.608
over and over from both of us.

14:37.136 --> 14:39.576
Aaron and Julie was just the last one.

14:44.163 --> 14:46.163
<i>I am done with this goddamn experiment.</i>

14:46.570 --> 14:48.870
She runs off the second
the wedding is over.

14:48.938 --> 14:50.604
That's... that's a message.

14:50.673 --> 14:51.872
That's a message she doesn't care,

14:51.941 --> 14:53.083
she can't be controlled.

14:53.084 --> 14:54.250
And she thinks she can
take the money and the fame

14:54.319 --> 14:56.108
that we gave her and ruin us.

14:56.323 --> 14:57.757
And if it's not Aaron and Julie,

14:57.758 --> 14:59.050
it'll be something else.

14:59.355 --> 15:01.507
- You know I'm right.
- Yes, you're right.

15:01.508 --> 15:03.989
We made a plan, and she lied to my face.

15:07.751 --> 15:08.833
Terence?

15:09.383 --> 15:10.963
This is gonna end now.

15:12.047 --> 15:13.616
What do you wanna do?

15:15.478 --> 15:17.135
I'm not talking about the Facility.

15:18.461 --> 15:19.571
Okay.

15:19.695 --> 15:21.561
Can't she just disappear like Colton?

15:23.890 --> 15:25.823
Colton was an idiot and a nobody.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.992
Megan is smart and half
the world knows her,

15:28.061 --> 15:30.058
- not to mention...
- Kyle, I know.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.343
That situation would have to be managed.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.467
I don't think that this is
something we can outsource.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.145
Gorgeous.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.966
Thank you. You too.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.703
Pinot grigio, please.

15:59.025 --> 16:01.626
I think they're wondering why
you're not with your husband.

16:01.695 --> 16:02.894
Did you speak to Kyle?

16:02.963 --> 16:05.395
Yes. Not fun.

16:05.832 --> 16:09.208
Well, he'll get over it, or he won't,

16:09.233 --> 16:10.631
but that's not your problem.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.909
Right. Could we talk business?

16:14.574 --> 16:17.067
The money was wired into
my account this morning.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.577
Congratulations.

16:19.996 --> 16:21.212
You just earned yourself

16:21.281 --> 16:23.163
a seat at the table with June Leighton.

16:24.575 --> 16:26.127
I can't wait to meet her.

16:27.922 --> 16:29.406
You should meet with June without me,

16:29.437 --> 16:30.742
keep things focused.

16:31.059 --> 16:32.068
You think so?

16:32.093 --> 16:33.164
Absolutely.

16:33.561 --> 16:35.513
She's staying in Beverly
Hills. I'll set it up.

16:44.672 --> 16:46.500
<i>There have been so many lies.</i>

16:48.009 --> 16:50.743
<i>What are you hiding?</i>

16:52.780 --> 16:56.070
<i>Tell me the truth. There's so many lies.</i>

16:56.718 --> 16:58.248
<i>I'm trying.</i>

16:58.653 --> 17:00.581
<i>What are you hiding?</i>

17:01.322 --> 17:02.889
<i>It doesn't matter anymore, Kyle.</i>

17:02.957 --> 17:04.348
<i>Tell me the truth.</i>

17:04.992 --> 17:08.554
<i>There have been so many lies
over and over from both of us.</i>

17:09.297 --> 17:11.297
<i>Aaron and Julie was just the last one.</i>

17:11.366 --> 17:13.266
<i>Just the last one.</i>

17:36.791 --> 17:38.855
Hey, it's Kyle West.

17:40.693 --> 17:41.881
I need to talk.

18:03.433 --> 18:04.788
You ready for this?

18:06.125 --> 18:07.203
I think so.

18:08.437 --> 18:09.815
That's the best we can ask for.

18:14.806 --> 18:16.073
How about you?

18:17.566 --> 18:18.762
I didn't sleep.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.691
Talking about a life, ending it...

18:26.232 --> 18:27.627
Out of options.

18:30.194 --> 18:31.466
Yeah.

18:33.264 --> 18:34.789
Does she suspect anything?

18:36.498 --> 18:37.742
No.

18:38.030 --> 18:40.513
She'll come to the room thinking
she's meeting June Leighton.

18:41.042 --> 18:43.309
I had a PA check Megan
into the hotel last night.

18:43.378 --> 18:45.252
- She brought me the key.
- A PA?

18:45.535 --> 18:47.011
She thinks I'm bringing it to Megan.

18:50.718 --> 18:52.279
No one will question this.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.321
She collapsed in public two months ago.

18:55.390 --> 18:56.856
Her personal life is a mess.

18:56.925 --> 18:59.066
People already assume she's on drugs.

19:01.729 --> 19:03.163
I added this to the narrative.

19:08.808 --> 19:10.100
You leaked this?

19:10.705 --> 19:12.302
More erratic behavior.

19:12.607 --> 19:13.963
It's worth the fallout.

19:16.420 --> 19:17.648
Smart.

19:51.846 --> 19:53.513
Kyle, over here!

21:14.540 --> 21:15.883
She's ready for you.

21:26.674 --> 21:27.869
Kyle's here.

21:28.543 --> 21:29.792
Great.

21:32.173 --> 21:33.401
I'm glad you called.

21:58.642 --> 21:59.692
Okay.

22:00.834 --> 22:02.528
Let's run through this one more time?

22:05.871 --> 22:08.728
Megan enters the hotel
through the VIP entrance.

22:13.138 --> 22:14.658
<i>There are no photographs,</i>

22:15.099 --> 22:16.557
<i>no video footage.</i>

22:22.431 --> 22:25.050
<i>She knocks on the door to June Leighton's room.</i>

22:32.494 --> 22:34.090
<i>She's surprised to see you.</i>

22:34.392 --> 22:36.552
<i>The plan was for her to meet June by herself.</i>

22:38.463 --> 22:40.314
<i>You tell her the plan's changed,</i>

22:41.506 --> 22:43.274
<i>that June is in the other room.</i>

22:45.136 --> 22:47.584
<i>She follows you inside, and doesn't see me.</i>

22:57.909 --> 22:59.386
<i>Should take about ten seconds.</i>

23:17.469 --> 23:18.917
<i>You create the narrative</i>

23:19.900 --> 23:21.460
<i>while I give her the dose.</i>

23:32.541 --> 23:33.893
<i>We leave.</i>

23:35.697 --> 23:37.263
<i>She's dead within the hour,</i>

23:38.447 --> 23:40.268
<i>and housekeeping finds her in the morning.</i>

23:48.381 --> 23:49.494
Good.

24:10.941 --> 24:12.153
It's time.

24:26.798 --> 24:27.950
<i>Last chance.</i>

24:29.401 --> 24:30.642
We can still bail out.

24:31.503 --> 24:33.657
What? No.

24:34.875 --> 24:36.199
No, take a deep breath.

24:36.552 --> 24:37.668
Center yourself.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.065
This is happening.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.251
Megan, hi.

25:00.344 --> 25:01.492
June.

25:01.746 --> 25:03.068
It's great to meet you.

25:26.003 --> 25:27.158
What are you doing?

25:29.805 --> 25:30.836
DeAnn.

25:38.816 --> 25:40.244
Megan's not coming.

25:41.448 --> 25:42.895
What? Did she text you?

25:48.685 --> 25:50.083
She was never coming.

25:55.835 --> 25:59.019
But I recorded you describing
your plan to murder her.

26:04.209 --> 26:05.388
It's all here.

26:10.689 --> 26:12.289
I just sent it to Megan.

26:12.314 --> 26:13.395
Don't.

26:16.089 --> 26:17.790
I will defend myself.

26:21.694 --> 26:24.295
You're sick and delusional.

26:24.364 --> 26:25.941
Back up.

26:33.503 --> 26:35.006
What is this, DeAnn?

26:35.984 --> 26:38.002
Revenge? For what?

26:38.378 --> 26:40.211
What did I ever do to you?

26:40.400 --> 26:42.847
20 years, what could possibly justify...

26:42.916 --> 26:44.449
You know what you've done...

26:45.685 --> 26:47.158
What you're capable of.

26:50.926 --> 26:53.117
Megan will not be harmed in any way.

26:53.326 --> 26:56.194
She will not be hurt or followed

26:56.667 --> 26:58.007
or harassed.

26:58.531 --> 27:01.328
No stories will show up
about her dead step-brother.

27:01.353 --> 27:02.500
I'm talking about you!

27:02.569 --> 27:04.079
Megan is me!

27:05.043 --> 27:06.673
She is my Kyle,

27:07.340 --> 27:09.358
and she's done being held back.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.696
You never saw her potential.
You tried to stifle it.

27:11.764 --> 27:14.004
I saw her potential for destruction.

27:14.029 --> 27:15.131
Yes,

27:15.712 --> 27:18.652
and now, we're going to blow Hollywood up.

27:19.076 --> 27:21.757
No more waiting. No more bullshit.

27:21.968 --> 27:23.544
It's our time now.

27:24.740 --> 27:26.970
It is finally our time.

27:33.876 --> 27:35.341
How long have you been planning this?

27:35.575 --> 27:36.870
Since I met her,

27:36.976 --> 27:38.723
since I saw her talent.

27:39.705 --> 27:42.067
It's why I pushed so hard for her.

27:48.647 --> 27:50.159
You're dead weight to me.

27:51.550 --> 27:53.246
You have been for a long time.

28:06.970 --> 28:08.970
Six weeks ago, during our interview,

28:08.995 --> 28:10.879
you asked me who I was.

28:11.197 --> 28:14.738
Yes, you said you were a loyal friend,

28:15.168 --> 28:17.108
a caring fiancé,

28:17.942 --> 28:19.213
a good man.

28:20.344 --> 28:21.571
That was a lie.

28:23.507 --> 28:24.906
That version of myself that

28:24.975 --> 28:26.349
I've presented to the world is a lie.

28:27.811 --> 28:31.227
I've been lying and
covering things up for years

28:32.016 --> 28:34.438
in order to sell something
that everybody could love.

28:36.341 --> 28:37.860
But I've realized that

28:38.622 --> 28:40.315
it's impossible to love yourself

28:41.525 --> 28:43.292
when you're lying about who you are.

28:44.762 --> 28:46.660
And you wanna love yourself?

28:47.598 --> 28:48.760
I hope to.

28:50.367 --> 28:52.100
I think that everything really good in life

28:53.437 --> 28:54.707
starts from there.

29:01.545 --> 29:02.646
So.

29:05.716 --> 29:08.913
What's the true story of Kyle West?

29:38.215 --> 29:39.818
Brave move coming here now.

29:40.617 --> 29:41.647
Or reckless.

29:41.672 --> 29:43.103
Always hard to tell with you.

29:44.611 --> 29:46.053
You're not surprised, though.

29:46.845 --> 29:47.850
No.

29:48.459 --> 29:50.348
You did the same thing
with your step-brother.

29:52.262 --> 29:53.532
I wanted to see you.

29:55.199 --> 29:57.566
I wanted to feel what it was like

29:57.634 --> 29:59.417
to be in the same room with you,

30:01.510 --> 30:03.314
knowing what you tried to do to me.

30:04.614 --> 30:07.365
Well, what does it feel like?

30:10.053 --> 30:11.396
Same as always.

30:13.775 --> 30:16.209
That's how you justify
what you tried to do to me

30:16.278 --> 30:17.611
for the past few months?

30:17.679 --> 30:18.725
No.

30:19.192 --> 30:20.847
That's just me being honest.

30:21.292 --> 30:22.412
Hmm.

30:22.584 --> 30:25.035
So, this is your moment of empowerment?

30:25.854 --> 30:27.747
The punctuation on your big win?

30:28.127 --> 30:29.370
It's fairly lukewarm.

30:30.097 --> 30:31.280
My win?

30:32.361 --> 30:33.975
I wanted to ruin you,

30:34.863 --> 30:36.476
take Kyle away,

30:37.399 --> 30:39.084
end this place.

30:39.801 --> 30:41.334
None of that's happening.

30:41.557 --> 30:43.573
I didn't come here for a victory lap,

30:45.274 --> 30:47.276
and maybe that's what's empowering.

30:49.545 --> 30:52.259
Well put. I'm not sure I buy it, though.

30:52.527 --> 30:54.515
Well, it doesn't matter
whether you buy it or not.

31:01.238 --> 31:04.126
Do you think you're a
good person at your core?

31:04.987 --> 31:06.393
I'm not getting into this.

31:06.418 --> 31:09.580
Well, you came here. Indulge me.

31:12.934 --> 31:15.281
I think I'm a good person, fundamentally.

31:16.562 --> 31:17.625
Not perfect,

31:19.256 --> 31:20.801
especially when I feel threatened,

31:21.133 --> 31:24.371
which I'm prone to, if I'm being honest.

31:25.640 --> 31:26.997
I don't react well.

31:27.905 --> 31:29.005
That's my weakness.

31:33.541 --> 31:35.191
Is that supposed to be an apology?

31:35.760 --> 31:37.599
No, no, I just...

31:37.950 --> 31:39.845
thought it might sound familiar.

31:42.021 --> 31:43.871
We're the same, remember?

31:44.739 --> 31:46.276
It's not a good combination.

31:54.399 --> 31:55.825
We are not the same,

31:57.046 --> 31:58.481
but we are even.

31:59.371 --> 32:00.747
You have something on me,

32:01.828 --> 32:03.348
I have something on you,

32:03.956 --> 32:05.299
and now I'm moving on.

32:11.550 --> 32:13.281
You know why you think we're the same?

32:14.186 --> 32:16.745
It's cause it justifies everything you do.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.305
You're the person you wanna hurt.

32:19.959 --> 32:21.641
You're the person you hate.

32:22.370 --> 32:24.460
And it's truly sick.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.630
I couldn't have said it better myself.

32:31.670 --> 32:32.769
You win.

32:34.503 --> 32:35.676
Go to hell.

32:40.723 --> 32:42.258
I left you out of everything.

32:43.147 --> 32:44.375
I intend to.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.638
It doesn't make it clean.

32:47.616 --> 32:49.716
Do you realize what a huge
scandal this is gonna be?

32:50.215 --> 32:51.315
I do,

32:51.587 --> 32:53.228
but all the focus will be on me.

32:53.589 --> 32:55.703
I don't want anyone else
to have to answer for this.

32:56.191 --> 32:58.174
Your career, it's done.

33:01.129 --> 33:02.308
Although,

33:02.431 --> 33:04.436
Mel Gibson, Robert Downey Jr.

33:05.100 --> 33:06.432
O.J.

33:06.778 --> 33:08.265
Come on, man, I'm not O.J.

33:08.780 --> 33:11.147
However this goes down, I can live with it.

33:11.216 --> 33:12.696
I wouldn't have done it otherwise.

33:13.302 --> 33:14.612
And what about her?

33:15.587 --> 33:16.820
Nothing's changed.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.297
I'm gonna win her back.

33:25.859 --> 33:27.307
Everything's changed.

33:28.562 --> 33:29.728
<i>To June Leighton.</i>

33:29.796 --> 33:31.211
And the actress playing her.

33:31.212 --> 33:33.045
Actress and, officially, producer.

33:33.114 --> 33:34.180
Mm.

33:34.737 --> 33:37.016
Speaking of which, we should
get some papers drawn up soon

33:37.085 --> 33:39.218
outlining our partnership,
structure of the company.

33:39.287 --> 33:40.853
We should do that now.

33:40.878 --> 33:43.035
There's someone I'd like to bring on.

33:43.815 --> 33:45.168
You didn't think you were gonna get her

33:45.193 --> 33:46.759
all to yourself, did you?

33:46.828 --> 33:48.142
Dear Jesus, no.

33:50.642 --> 33:52.722
Aww, don't fight it, DeAnn.

33:52.934 --> 33:54.264
You love me.

33:54.265 --> 33:55.935
- I dislike you.
- Mm.

33:56.003 --> 33:58.389
But I do respect your taste.

34:01.454 --> 34:02.775
I feel like this is the beginning

34:02.844 --> 34:04.577
- of a beautiful friendship.

34:04.645 --> 34:06.612
That might be taking things a
little too far at the moment.

34:23.130 --> 34:24.199
Hey.

34:25.900 --> 34:27.364
Sorry it's been a few days.

34:27.434 --> 34:29.333
Yeah, I was wondering what happened to you.

34:36.603 --> 34:38.474
You're staying at IHM, aren't you?

34:39.840 --> 34:40.967
Yes.

34:41.975 --> 34:45.746
Okay, well, you made your choice.

34:46.880 --> 34:48.812
I can't argue with you anymore.

34:50.350 --> 34:51.931
Megan, please,

34:52.386 --> 34:53.952
I need to do this with integrity.

34:54.021 --> 34:55.571
There's something else.

34:59.616 --> 35:02.227
I was the one who moved Aaron and Julie.

35:04.198 --> 35:05.241
They're safe.

35:05.732 --> 35:07.708
They'll be taken care of
like you wanted them to.

35:09.369 --> 35:10.889
You told Terence?

35:12.072 --> 35:14.641
I didn't tell Terence, you did.

35:17.273 --> 35:18.710
He doesn't know where they are.

35:18.779 --> 35:20.072
That was part of the deal.

35:21.048 --> 35:23.411
I blamed all of this on Kyle.

35:24.751 --> 35:27.445
You've never seen IHM's potential.

35:27.888 --> 35:29.821
I've seen it change people's lives,

35:29.890 --> 35:33.024
and give them hope and purpose.

35:33.093 --> 35:34.264
Shaun.

35:34.695 --> 35:36.209
I love you, Megan,

35:36.630 --> 35:38.580
but you could've ruined everything.

35:49.923 --> 35:51.403
Well, the segment is great.

35:51.404 --> 35:53.705
It's gonna be the lead
story on the Wednesday show,

35:53.772 --> 35:54.972
so...

35:54.973 --> 35:57.852
<i>Get ready. The madness is nigh.</i>

35:58.096 --> 35:59.362
As ready as I can be.

35:59.430 --> 36:01.030
<i>Great. Hey, listen.</i>

36:01.098 --> 36:03.866
<i>For the epilogue, I wanted to get your comment</i>

36:03.935 --> 36:05.979
on the Xavier Hughes rumors.

36:06.768 --> 36:07.770
What rumors?

36:07.839 --> 36:10.133
<i>Well, that he and Megan are together.</i>

36:11.876 --> 36:13.509
Like they had an on-set affair?

36:13.578 --> 36:15.614
Come on, Iris, I'm not
gonna dignify that one.

36:15.780 --> 36:17.546
<i>Well, they were spotted together</i>

36:17.615 --> 36:19.179
<i>the morning of your wedding.</i>

36:20.184 --> 36:21.417
<i>And Kyle,</i>

36:21.710 --> 36:24.086
I have a paparazzi photo of her

36:24.155 --> 36:27.340
<i>showing up at his house the night before, late.</i>

36:29.293 --> 36:30.659
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

36:31.104 --> 36:33.012
Would you like me to send it to you?

36:34.510 --> 36:35.546
No.

37:29.620 --> 37:30.979
When tomorrow comes,

37:31.305 --> 37:33.409
today will be unrecognizable.

37:34.642 --> 37:36.120
Artificial intelligence,

37:36.660 --> 37:39.441
biotechnology, climate change.

37:40.848 --> 37:43.223
The world is advancing
faster than we can process,

37:44.418 --> 37:47.242
and yet humanity must find
a way to evolve with it.

37:49.804 --> 37:52.023
<i>We evolve, or we die.</i>

37:57.813 --> 37:59.298
<i>Our work here at IHM</i>

37:59.367 --> 38:01.615
provides us the unique capacity to lead.

38:02.236 --> 38:05.790
And Vita is our evolutionary advantage,

38:06.507 --> 38:08.627
the synthesis of a higher mind

38:09.443 --> 38:11.272
and an extended life expectancy.

38:12.747 --> 38:14.316
IHM is the future.

38:14.615 --> 38:17.316
We are the future, and
we will show the world.

38:24.333 --> 38:25.524
I know what you gave up for this,

38:25.593 --> 38:26.898
and I appreciate it.

38:28.057 --> 38:29.830
I'm focused on what I got.

38:30.698 --> 38:32.695
First life is back on the books.

38:34.235 --> 38:35.805
You also got a new partner.

38:37.838 --> 38:39.251
This is ours now.

39:11.605 --> 39:12.953
Hey.

39:14.408 --> 39:16.126
I spoke to Shaun, and...

39:16.944 --> 39:19.670
she told me what really
happened with Aaron and Julie.

39:21.069 --> 39:22.703
They're okay, they're safe.

39:26.815 --> 39:28.254
I'm sorry.

39:29.347 --> 39:30.606
I was wrong.

39:32.126 --> 39:34.159
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

39:36.430 --> 39:38.661
I did an interview with Iris Holloway.

39:39.900 --> 39:41.369
I told her about Aaron.

39:43.186 --> 39:44.398
Everything?

39:45.740 --> 39:46.835
Yeah.

39:47.993 --> 39:49.635
I blew my whole life up

39:50.890 --> 39:51.999
for you,

39:53.123 --> 39:54.646
so that you could see that I'm someone

39:54.715 --> 39:56.041
who could tell the truth.

39:59.400 --> 40:00.481
Kyle...

40:03.328 --> 40:04.839
Kyle, I'm sorry, I...

40:05.192 --> 40:06.590
I didn't expect you to...

40:10.197 --> 40:11.362
Oh, my God.

40:13.367 --> 40:14.584
What happened?

40:15.936 --> 40:17.067
Kyle?

40:18.043 --> 40:19.600
Did you sleep with Xavier?

40:22.676 --> 40:23.811
What?

40:25.349 --> 40:26.509
So guilty.

40:27.681 --> 40:29.098
- Kyle, I...
- Don't.

40:29.988 --> 40:32.061
Don't stand here and lie to me right now.

40:34.930 --> 40:36.482
You want an arrangement,

40:37.458 --> 40:38.989
so we're gonna have an arrangement,

40:40.141 --> 40:42.275
except it's gonna be on my terms now,

40:42.430 --> 40:44.463
not yours, not Terence's.

40:44.532 --> 40:46.344
Babe, babe, you have to understand

40:46.369 --> 40:47.669
what was going through my head that night.

40:47.694 --> 40:48.962
No, I don't.

40:49.687 --> 40:51.941
I don't give a shit what
was going on in your head.

40:53.504 --> 40:55.207
I've spent this entire year

40:55.276 --> 40:56.815
trying to be perfect.

40:57.211 --> 40:59.899
I am so done caring what you think.

41:00.858 --> 41:02.282
From here on out,

41:03.451 --> 41:06.133
we're gonna follow the
contract to the letter...

41:06.387 --> 41:07.986
The contract that you violated.

41:08.290 --> 41:09.588
To the letter?

41:10.291 --> 41:12.143
What exactly does that mean?

41:12.616 --> 41:14.136
You're gonna do what I tell you to do.

41:15.109 --> 41:17.051
You're gonna go where I tell you to go.

41:17.593 --> 41:19.698
You're gonna see who I tell you to see.

41:19.767 --> 41:21.064
Everything.

41:21.402 --> 41:22.658
And if you don't,

41:23.504 --> 41:25.471
I swear to God I will ruin you

41:25.973 --> 41:27.358
the way you ruined me.

41:33.617 --> 41:34.784
Kyle.

41:40.812 --> 41:42.554
You think you can control me?

41:47.081 --> 41:48.252
Good luck.
