00:02.503 --> 00:04.172
Previously on Empire...
PEPPER: Family day's next week.

00:04.205 --> 00:05.973
Why don't you show up
and do a little show at Wallace?

00:06.006 --> 00:08.042
I'm-a have my
own summer jam.

00:08.076 --> 00:09.410
Cookie's Cookout.

00:09.443 --> 00:10.911
All them dudes that kidnapped me
had a brand on their back.

00:10.944 --> 00:12.346
Like this?

00:12.380 --> 00:14.548
I had no idea I was gonna
fall in love with you.
Mm-mm.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.850
When I got the word I was
in full remission, I said,

00:16.884 --> 00:18.986
"I'm gonna have a lot of fun
with the rest of my life!"

00:19.019 --> 00:20.988
Is that the wifey
or the girlfriend?

00:21.021 --> 00:22.823
ANIKA: Hakeem, it's me.
Give me a call back.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.326
Babies are like
kryptonite for Lucious.
Really?

00:25.359 --> 00:27.661
Wasn't that the song
that you wrote for Camilla?
Who?

00:27.695 --> 00:28.929
You won't ever be a Lyon.

00:28.962 --> 00:32.200
I am devoting the rest of
my life to LGBT people.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.567
And I'm gonna help you, Jamal.

00:33.601 --> 00:36.337
Leverage whatever we have to.
Just get me Swiftstream.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.773
I am the O.G. Skye Summers fan.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.242
If I sang my whole truth,

00:41.275 --> 00:42.610
my fans would turn on me.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.381
*

00:47.415 --> 00:50.218
(crowd cheering)

00:50.251 --> 00:51.252
What up? What up?

00:51.285 --> 00:52.920
I'm Jason Derulo, live in L.A.,

00:52.953 --> 00:56.056
big city of dreams,
where it's all going down today.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.458
It's ASA nomination day.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.229
All day long,
you're gonna be hearing from

01:01.262 --> 01:02.630
some of your
favorite music artists

01:02.663 --> 01:04.232
giving us the nominees

01:04.265 --> 01:06.767
of some of the greatest
music acts this year.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.971
So the nominations will be
live-streaming on the screens

01:11.004 --> 01:13.941
all day long, and every Empire
artist has been put on notice.

01:13.974 --> 01:16.110
Everyone that gets a
nomination and comes to town

01:16.144 --> 01:17.278
will be doing press.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.447
And then Skye does
the Empire party.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.315
How many nominations
you expect for Empire, Pop?

01:21.349 --> 01:22.550
I expect to lose count.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.452
But getting the nominations
ain't the thing.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.788
I mean, I got 19 of them over
the years and never won one.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.490
This'll be the year
you break the streak, boss.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.225
Yeah, whatever.
What I'm most interested in

01:31.259 --> 01:33.327
is our Swiftstream
announcement.

01:33.361 --> 01:35.329
DERULO: It's my honor
and pleasure to announce

01:35.363 --> 01:37.165
the very first
nomination of the day,

01:37.198 --> 01:39.467
for Best R&B Song.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.002
First up, we got Chalayne
for "Last Breath,"

01:42.035 --> 01:43.771
Gordon Treble for "Opus,"

01:43.804 --> 01:46.140
Niles Porter
for "Live and Direct,"

01:46.174 --> 01:48.442
and, first time ever,
my boy Jamal Lyon for "Heavy."

01:48.476 --> 01:51.312
(squeals) It's happening!
It's happening!

01:51.345 --> 01:52.680
There's a lot
of ASA parties going on,

01:52.713 --> 01:54.982
performances,
lot of crazy things happening.

01:55.015 --> 01:57.818
So I would stick close
to my Twitter notifications,

01:57.851 --> 01:59.787
Instagram-- like, all of that.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.021
QUESTLOVE:
This is Questlove.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.523
More nominations
throughout the day,

02:02.556 --> 02:03.524
every hour on the hour.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.293
Don't miss out.

02:05.326 --> 02:08.296
Listen, man, our permits
are good for two months.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.530
All right? No.

02:09.563 --> 02:12.099
Look, we're bringing our
new promoter in, okay?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.534
All right, I'll
call you back.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.170
Well?

02:16.204 --> 02:18.506
Everybody keeps saying
we're a security risk.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.774
I'm sorry, Hakeem.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.610
It's not your fault, Ma.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.945
Can't believe
I let that bitch play me.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.681
Do you know
what today is?

02:27.715 --> 02:29.517
ASA nomination day.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.685
The day where I get
my "Best Rapper" shout,

02:31.719 --> 02:34.188
and that'll help us land a
better venue for your Cookout.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.889
Thank you, baby.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.392
Oh, and thank you
and Laura so much

02:38.426 --> 02:41.028
for agreeing to perform
at the family day show

02:41.061 --> 02:42.830
at Wallace today.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.633
Are you sure we got
to do it today?

02:45.666 --> 02:46.900
It's not good timing.

02:46.934 --> 02:50.571
Walking back into that prison
in this headspace

02:50.604 --> 02:52.706
is the last thing I want
to do, believe that,

02:52.740 --> 02:56.577
but I owe Pepper 'cause she
helped me find your Aunt Carol.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.911
(chuckles)
Ooh, plus,

02:57.945 --> 03:00.314
there's somebody I want
you to meet-- Jezzy.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.482
She's this rapper.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.484
Oh, my God, she's
so amazing, Hakeem.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.085
I'm gonna put her
on that stage.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.520
Wait until you
hear her spit.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.956
She's the real deal.

03:12.092 --> 03:14.395
Congratulations on
your nomination.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.196
Hey! (laughs)

03:16.230 --> 03:17.998
Hey.
I'm so excited for you.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.833
Thank you.
I can't wait to celebrate.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.835
You look so nice. Yeah.
Thank you.

03:21.869 --> 03:25.606
We should get to the, um,
ASA party quick though, 'cause

03:25.639 --> 03:27.007
we got a song to debut.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.909
You know what I bet?

03:28.942 --> 03:31.379
I bet you're gonna get
Song of the Year, too.
No, I'm not.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.880
Yes. Watch.
No, I promise I won't.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.882
I'm telling you. I see it.
You trippin', stop.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.617
I'm telling you. Watch.
Stop, you're gonna
make me all nervous.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.619
You're acting nervous.
I am nervous.

03:38.652 --> 03:39.753
(laughs)
But, look,

03:39.787 --> 03:41.221
it's gonna be
even better next year.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.791
Best Duet:
Skye Summers, Jamal Lyon,

03:43.824 --> 03:44.858
"Powerful."

03:44.892 --> 03:46.126
Yes!
That's what I need.

03:46.159 --> 03:49.096
That's got to be that.
Hey, um...

03:49.129 --> 03:50.898
Listen,

03:50.931 --> 03:52.400
we should probably, um,

03:52.433 --> 03:53.901
talk about what hap...

03:53.934 --> 03:57.137
Dad. What's up?

03:57.170 --> 03:59.773
Hey, Lucious.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.910
We're on our way
to the Charlamagne ASA event

04:02.943 --> 04:04.545
to debut our new song
we've been working on.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.879
I can't wait for you
to hear it.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.881
I'm so excited.
I'll meet you in the car, babe.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.517
All right.
All right.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.587
Bye.
Summer.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.725
Babe?

04:17.758 --> 04:20.594
Dad, just...

04:20.628 --> 04:22.262
chill on it,
all right?

04:22.296 --> 04:24.298
Are you hitting that?

04:28.436 --> 04:30.270
Look, well, I'm still
gay, all right?

04:30.304 --> 04:32.440
So don't get weird.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.347
She fixed you.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.392
Yeah.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.030
*

05:01.569 --> 05:04.805
No, Mimi, it was you that
told me that if we're not

05:04.838 --> 05:07.341
in music streaming,
we're in the dust, right?

05:07.375 --> 05:08.842
I never thought
you'd go off and leverage

05:08.876 --> 05:11.011
whole divisions of the company.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.447
The board's going to want to
review those kind of decisions.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.483
No, the board don't
like risk, Mimi.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.485
That's their problem;
they're not like us.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.053
You got to trust me
on this one, baby.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.555
I trust you, Lucious.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.223
But I have to answer
to the board.

05:23.256 --> 05:26.293
I told you before,
to hell with that damn board.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.562
I didn't ask the board's
approval when I risked my life

05:28.596 --> 05:30.831
to build the damn company,
and I'll be damned

05:30.864 --> 05:33.133
if I'm gonna ask
a board of directors

05:33.166 --> 05:35.669
how to move my pieces
on my chessboard.

05:35.703 --> 05:38.572
Oh, you're a grandmaster,
Lucious.

05:38.606 --> 05:39.907
Damn right.

05:39.940 --> 05:43.577
And when this deal closes,
I'm cleaning house.

05:43.611 --> 05:46.313
Whoever stood
against me is out.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.081
So the question is:

05:48.115 --> 05:51.018
is you is or is
you ain't my Mimi?

05:51.051 --> 05:53.020
Because I always thought
we saw the world

05:53.053 --> 05:54.688
the same way, darling.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.390
Mm.

05:56.424 --> 05:59.460
I'm learning to see the world
the way you see it, Lucious.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.096
I'm learning
something new every day.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.500
My wife just flew in from Milan.

06:06.534 --> 06:09.002
I'm going to have her join us
at the announcement.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.337
Can't wait for you to meet her.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.039
Does that mean we won't have

06:12.072 --> 06:14.742
any more of our private
celebratory parties?

06:14.775 --> 06:16.777
Oh, maybe another time.
I have to go back

06:16.810 --> 06:19.447
to Rancho Mirage
for some follow-up treatments.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.682
Is everything okay?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.517
Staying positive.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.386
Getting everything done
that I need to get done.

06:26.420 --> 06:29.222
I am so glad
we closed this Swiftstream deal.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.258
Big dog stuff.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.528
(chuckles)

06:34.562 --> 06:36.096
ANGELA YEE:
Good morning, y'all. What's up?

06:36.129 --> 06:37.931
It's Angela Yee,
and we're here live

06:37.965 --> 06:40.468
at Charlamagne Tha God's
ASA nomination jam!

06:40.501 --> 06:42.436
Give it up for Tiana!

06:42.470 --> 06:43.904
(crowd cheering)

06:43.937 --> 06:45.072
*

06:45.105 --> 06:47.475
* Oh, I see it
in your face, babe *

06:47.508 --> 06:50.744
* You wanna know
how it taste, babe *

06:50.778 --> 06:52.613
* Watchin' me

06:52.646 --> 06:55.749
* You want a piece of this
cake, cake, cake, cake *

06:55.783 --> 06:58.251
* You like to watch,
that's kinda nasty *

06:58.285 --> 07:00.754
* But I ain't mad at ya,
I ain't even mad at ya *

07:00.788 --> 07:03.457
* Don't it look soft,
I know you wanna touch me *

07:03.491 --> 07:05.759
* And, daddy,
I ain't even mad at cha *

07:05.793 --> 07:07.461
* 'Cause you lookin'
like you wanna know *

07:07.495 --> 07:08.896
* What the hell
you waiting for? *

07:08.929 --> 07:10.831
* I'm-a poke it out
so you can see it clear *

07:10.864 --> 07:12.265
* Said you lookin'
like you wanna know *

07:12.299 --> 07:14.101
* What the hell
you waiting for? *

07:14.134 --> 07:15.936
* Own it like you want it
and get over here *

07:15.969 --> 07:18.906
* Come and do some with it,
do some with it *

07:18.939 --> 07:21.475
* Standing there staring at it,
boy, come and get it *

07:21.509 --> 07:22.976
* Come and do some with it

07:23.010 --> 07:25.145
* Do some with it,
standing there *

07:25.178 --> 07:26.514
* Staring at it,

07:26.547 --> 07:27.648
* 'Cause you lookin' like

07:27.681 --> 07:29.449
* What the hell
you waiting for? *

07:29.483 --> 07:31.284
* Own it like you want it
and get over here... *

07:31.318 --> 07:32.452
JAMAL:
She's fire, Ma.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.454
Lyon Dynasty's gonna get
so many nominations.

07:34.488 --> 07:35.856
We're going to Empire
afterwards

07:35.889 --> 07:37.357
to show the Pepsi commercial.
You coming?

07:37.390 --> 07:39.660
(sighs)
I wish I could, baby,

07:39.693 --> 07:41.529
but I got to go back
to Wallace prison.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.296
The girls-- they
expect me to perf...

07:43.330 --> 07:44.965
Ma. It's all right.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.300
You're always there for me;
go be there for them.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.502
I love you.
Are you sure?

07:48.536 --> 07:49.937
I'm sure.
Okay.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.104
Thank you, baby.
I love you.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.372
I love you, too.
Hey, Dad.

07:52.405 --> 07:53.707
Hey, boy.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.143
So Rico Suave's not
cleaning your pool no more.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.945
Shut up, Lucious.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.780
Look...

07:59.813 --> 08:01.348
I need Laviticus.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.184
I lost the venue
for my Cookout.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.119
You mean the Cookout
you was planning

08:06.153 --> 08:07.888
with that dude that
kidnapped my son?

08:07.921 --> 08:09.557
I'm serious, Lucious.
I need this.

08:09.590 --> 08:10.724
You must be desperate.

08:10.758 --> 08:13.060
No. No. The same
way I needed you

08:13.093 --> 08:14.695
to help me with
Swiftstream.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.163
Now, you know that's different.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.932
Our legacy is not up for sale
and it shouldn't be up for sale.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.802
Well, I closed
the deal anyway.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.738
So I'm in a real good mood,
so I'm-a tell you...

08:24.772 --> 08:26.574
no.
Of course.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.576
You can't use
Laviticus.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.743
* 'Cause you're lookin' like
you wanna know *

08:29.777 --> 08:31.745
* What the hell
you waiting for? *

08:31.779 --> 08:33.647
* Own it like you want it
and get over here. *

08:33.681 --> 08:34.782
(crowd cheering)

08:39.687 --> 08:41.454
(music ends, cheering continues)

08:43.256 --> 08:45.425
She's about to announce
the next ASA awards.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.927
Hakeem's category.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.062
TIANA:
Thank you, everybody,

08:49.096 --> 08:51.531
and happy ASA nomination day.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.166
(crowd cheering)

08:53.200 --> 08:56.503
I'm so excited to be here
and to announce the ASA nominees

08:56.536 --> 08:58.171
for Rapper of the Year.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.339
Are y'all ready?

08:59.372 --> 09:01.374
(crowd cheers)

09:01.408 --> 09:03.877
Okay. And the nominees are....

09:05.913 --> 09:09.850
...Blu-On,
Powda Yay, Scrills and...

09:09.883 --> 09:11.852
Freda Gatz?

09:11.885 --> 09:13.286
And, yes, Freda Gatz.

09:13.320 --> 09:16.023
(crowd cheering)

09:16.056 --> 09:17.290
YEE: All right,
check your 'grams for

09:17.324 --> 09:19.693
the Best Country Album nominees
at noon, 11:00 Central.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.461
Today is ASA nomination day...

09:21.494 --> 09:23.530
That belonged to Hakeem.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.532
If it was Hakeem's,
he would've got it.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.235
Hakeem may have won
that little battle,

09:28.268 --> 09:30.904
but Freda is clearly
winning the war.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.906
(TV clicks off)

09:41.649 --> 09:43.617
YEE: Charlamagne Tha God
and American Sound Awards

09:43.651 --> 09:46.654
is proud to present four-time
ASA winner Skye Summers

09:46.687 --> 09:49.623
and first-time nominee
Jamal Lyon.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.692
(crowd cheering,
piano playing "Powerful")

09:56.496 --> 09:59.900
* People been talking about it

09:59.933 --> 10:03.436
* We won't just stand here
in silence *

10:03.470 --> 10:06.674
* Can't stop the fire
from rising *

10:06.707 --> 10:08.141
* Rising

10:08.175 --> 10:10.110
* Whoa, oh

10:10.143 --> 10:13.747
* People, don't you be afraid

10:13.781 --> 10:16.750
* So many innocent slain

10:16.784 --> 10:20.287
* This is an era for change

10:20.320 --> 10:22.823
* Change

10:22.856 --> 10:30.030
* Malcolm's probably
turning in his grave *

10:30.063 --> 10:35.502
* Every shade was
beautifully made *

10:35.535 --> 10:39.339
* And powerful

10:39.372 --> 10:42.843
* There's so much strength
in you and me *

10:42.876 --> 10:46.379
* Powerful

10:46.413 --> 10:49.717
* A breath away from victory

10:49.750 --> 10:51.551
* I matter

10:51.584 --> 10:53.386
* You matter

10:53.420 --> 10:56.389
* We matter, oh

10:56.423 --> 10:58.625
* I matter

10:58.658 --> 11:00.493
* You matter

11:00.527 --> 11:03.230
* We matter, oh...

11:03.263 --> 11:06.066
This is a great song, but I
thought Jamal was gonna sing

11:06.099 --> 11:07.801
the song that he
was nominated for.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.136
You know, Best R&B Song.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.304
No, Best R&B Song
is a category

11:11.338 --> 11:13.673
they created
to placate black people.

11:13.707 --> 11:16.509
The only thing with any prestige
is Song of the Year.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.912
Isn't that the only one that
you were never nominated for?

11:18.946 --> 11:22.215
SKYE:
* I see a colorful future

11:22.249 --> 11:25.652
* Where skin don't
define any human *

11:25.685 --> 11:29.522
* And stars are
the only thing shooting *

11:29.556 --> 11:32.860
* Shooting, oh
* Oh

11:32.893 --> 11:36.263
* Mothers who bury
their child *

11:36.296 --> 11:39.599
* How can we sit there
and hide? *

11:39.632 --> 11:42.836
* Change comes when
all take a stand now *

11:42.870 --> 11:45.305
* Stand up

11:47.240 --> 11:50.343
* Oh-oh, oh-oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh *

11:50.377 --> 11:53.680
* Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh *

11:53.713 --> 11:57.851
* Oh-oh, oh-oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh. *

11:57.885 --> 11:59.887
(music ends, crowd cheering)

12:04.091 --> 12:06.226
CHARLAMAGNE:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

12:06.259 --> 12:08.595
It's Charlamagne
on ASA nomination day.

12:08.628 --> 12:09.797
We got Skye Summers here,

12:09.830 --> 12:12.565
four-time ASA winner,
and Jamal Lyon.

12:12.599 --> 12:13.566
Now, Jamal, you got nominated

12:13.600 --> 12:14.701
for your first ever
ASA this morning.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.036
How you feel, brother?

12:16.069 --> 12:17.905
Yes, sir. I feel amazing.
Thank you. Thank you.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.240
CHARLAMAGNE: The song
you just performed, "Powerful,"

12:20.273 --> 12:23.243
really pro-black song,
really socially conscious song,

12:23.276 --> 12:24.744
but, Skye, what up though?

12:24.778 --> 12:25.913
You black now?

12:25.946 --> 12:27.747
(crowd murmuring)

12:27.781 --> 12:29.449
Really, Charlamagne? Really?

12:29.482 --> 12:30.583
I'm just saying,

12:30.617 --> 12:32.452
you don't usually
identify as black.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.421
What do you mean? It's no secret
that I'm half black.

12:34.454 --> 12:37.124
I'm biracial,
and I identify as me.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.826
CHARLAMAGNE: But isn't that
just a nice way of saying,

12:38.859 --> 12:40.493
you know,
you don't want to be black?

12:40.527 --> 12:41.761
(scoffs) What?
Wait, wait, wait.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.096
Ease up, man.
Come on, now.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.497
Why does Skye
have to pick a side?

12:44.531 --> 12:45.632
You know what
I'm saying?

12:45.665 --> 12:47.100
Everybody wants to
put labels on people,

12:47.134 --> 12:48.435
put us in boxes. It doesn't
always have to be like that.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.137
But she's up here
singing about a race

12:50.170 --> 12:51.571
that she never really claims.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.806
So I'm just curious.

12:52.840 --> 12:53.740
Y'all not curious?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.608
(crowd murmuring)

12:55.642 --> 12:58.045
I mean, Jamal, you gay, right?

13:01.014 --> 13:02.983
(sighs)
Yeah, man. They all know that.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.417
So, if you identify as gay,

13:04.451 --> 13:06.920
but then you started
getting involved with a woman,

13:06.954 --> 13:08.155
you know, people would be
looking at you

13:08.188 --> 13:09.356
kind of crazy.
They'd be upset, like,

13:09.389 --> 13:11.992
"Maybe he's just choosing
whatever label he wants

13:12.025 --> 13:13.760
based on a matter
of convenience."

13:13.793 --> 13:15.795
(crowd murmuring)

13:18.031 --> 13:20.834
She wasn't even scheduled
to be on Charlamagne's show.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.870
Judith, it was my
idea, all right?

13:22.903 --> 13:23.937
Well, what were you thinking?

13:23.971 --> 13:25.172
He was thinking big.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.673
That's what he was doing.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.541
I certainly didn't think
that she was gonna

13:28.575 --> 13:29.809
get dragged on
Twitter like this.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.444
I mean, these are
our people, you know?

13:31.478 --> 13:33.046
I just don't get it.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.382
It's not like I was performing
in blackface.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.816
Like, why would they be...

13:36.850 --> 13:38.551
Look at this.
Some fool puts the...

13:38.585 --> 13:40.954
Rachel what's-her-name
afro wig on me.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.389
(sighs)

13:42.422 --> 13:45.125
She has a pop career.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.327
Image is everything.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.063
One crap move like this
will take years to fix!

13:50.097 --> 13:52.665
Will you relax, Judith?
You need a martini or something?

13:52.699 --> 13:54.734
Look, the song is hot.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.336
It's fire, actually.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.305
And the haters,
they gonna burn over.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.739
And by the end of the day,

13:59.772 --> 14:02.709
Twitter's gonna be roasting
somebody else, so it's cool.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.844
Why didn't you defend me?

14:04.878 --> 14:06.579
Why didn't you say anything?

14:06.613 --> 14:08.081
'Cause he brought up
you were gay or...

14:08.115 --> 14:09.883
I specifically told that man...
No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.985
Jamal ain't got nothing to do
with it, sweetie.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.753
(chuckles): You just picked
the wrong day to be black.

14:13.786 --> 14:15.488
Dad.
How dare you?

14:15.522 --> 14:17.424
I'm kidding. Look.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.927
After we show
Jamal's Pepsi jam,

14:19.960 --> 14:21.361
I'm putting you onstage.

14:21.394 --> 14:24.431
You're performing at my...
Swiftstream announcement, right?

14:24.464 --> 14:26.533
You're gonna be onstage
in front of

14:26.566 --> 14:28.001
a much friendlier
audience.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.036
Promise you,

14:29.069 --> 14:30.237
everything's gonna be fine.

14:30.270 --> 14:31.571
You're gonna
remind everybody why

14:31.604 --> 14:33.040
they love you so much.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.943
We got a long day ahead of us,
but it's okay, I promise.

14:35.976 --> 14:39.746
(alarm wailing)

14:39.779 --> 14:40.780
(alarm stops)

14:40.813 --> 14:42.015
(sighs)

14:42.049 --> 14:43.583
I know.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.086
We got to get the security
company to fix the alarm, babe.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.921
I'm on it. I called
this morning.

14:47.955 --> 14:50.590
Thank you.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.592
You know, I really appreciate
you coming home

14:52.625 --> 14:54.962
on your lunch break to help me
with the nursery.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.064
Thanks, babe.
No problem, baby.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.132
Thank you for carrying our boy.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.934
(laughs)
You're welcome.

15:00.968 --> 15:01.935
(doorbell rings)

15:01.969 --> 15:03.270
Who's at the gate?

15:03.303 --> 15:05.105
Oh, that's Anika.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.773
She's actually coming over
to see the nursery.

15:06.806 --> 15:07.774
Again?

15:07.807 --> 15:10.243
Yeah. She's just...

15:10.277 --> 15:12.445
I don't know.
She's really lonely.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.982
Yeah, I know.
I feel bad for her.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.483
My family really
messed her over.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.218
Mm-hmm.
Maybe she'll come

15:18.251 --> 15:20.120
to church with us one Sunday.
Yeah, that's nice.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.222
I can ask her.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.257
MAN: Empire welcomes
Jamieson Hinthrop

15:24.291 --> 15:25.425
on ASA nomination day.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.095
Hello, everyone.
I'm Jamieson Hinthrop.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.429
Minutes ago,

15:29.462 --> 15:32.499
Katy Perry announced
Best Male Pop Vocals.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.667
And we just happen to have
one of those nominees

15:34.701 --> 15:36.736
right here. Jamal Lyon.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.506
(crowd cheering)
Come on up.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.577
(chuckles)

15:44.611 --> 15:47.014
Thank you.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.782
How many nominations
have you racked up so far?

15:49.816 --> 15:50.417
Five!

15:50.450 --> 15:51.751
(chuckles)

15:51.784 --> 15:53.420
Uh, five.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.355
Five. That's amazing.

15:55.388 --> 15:56.523
Thank you so much.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.858
Having lived through a time
when an openly gay man

15:58.891 --> 16:00.093
could not have stood here

16:00.127 --> 16:03.663
so open, so out and so free,

16:03.696 --> 16:05.198
I take a very personal pride
in your accomplishments.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.266
Thank you.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.800
JAMIESON:
But that's not all.

16:07.834 --> 16:08.935
I believe that
there's another milestone

16:08.968 --> 16:10.037
that you're gonna
share with us now, right?

16:10.070 --> 16:11.604
JAMAL:
Yes.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.606
I am sharing with
all of you guys

16:13.640 --> 16:16.109
for the first time the premiere
of my Pepsi commercial.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.710
So...

16:17.744 --> 16:18.845
(crowd cheering)

16:18.878 --> 16:20.713
I have to take a second

16:20.747 --> 16:23.316
and say thank you so much
to my-my mom and dad.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.884
Wasn't for y'all,
I would not be here,

16:24.917 --> 16:27.454
in more ways than one,
so thank you so much.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.789
And, uh, without further ado,
it's my Pepsi commercial.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.224
Jamieson, thank
you so much.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.359
(crowd cheering)

16:39.266 --> 16:40.900
I hope you're not
leaving right away.

16:40.933 --> 16:43.736
You know, I've got my own little
announcement I want to make.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.405
Yeah, yeah, the Swiftstream.
I heard.

16:45.438 --> 16:46.839
Lucious, um...

16:48.007 --> 16:50.643
...if Jamal gets
a Song of the Year nomination,

16:50.677 --> 16:54.214
(chuckles) I'm gonna mount
a major campaign around it.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.982
You should.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.551
You realize
that you set a very high bar?

16:58.585 --> 16:59.852
Thank you.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.554
He cleared it.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.224
But you said it--
isn't that every parent's dream,

17:04.257 --> 17:07.160
to have their children
surpass them?

17:07.194 --> 17:08.861
It's not my dream.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.232
I'm just kidding.
(laughs)

17:12.265 --> 17:14.667
BECKY:
It's starting!

17:14.701 --> 17:16.703
("Ready to Go" playing)

17:22.775 --> 17:24.010
The commercial's
fantastic, Lucious.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.512
The Tim would like
to do a profile on Jamal.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.880
I told them
it had to be a cover.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.550
That's gonna be a little tricky,
isn't it?

17:30.583 --> 17:31.951
Why's that?

17:31.984 --> 17:34.187
I mean, seeing Jamal's got
a girlfriend and all.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.556
I mean, not that
that should determine

17:36.589 --> 17:38.758
whether or not
they do the story.

17:44.597 --> 17:47.267
He didn't tell you?

17:47.300 --> 17:49.035
Oops. (chuckles)

17:49.068 --> 17:51.070
I got a big mouth.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.876
(cell door buzzes)

17:56.909 --> 17:58.511
(indistinct radio chatter)

18:04.317 --> 18:05.952
(shuddering breath)

18:05.985 --> 18:07.820
Please. Please.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.725
I miss my son.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.061
Just take this pain away.
Take this pain away, God.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.296
I can't take it anymore.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.798
I can't do this.
I got to go be with Hakeem.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.967
He's upset about the ASAs.
Cookie, wait.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.835
Now, you said you was gonna
come through for these ladies.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.872
So, you already here. You might
as well get it out the way.

18:39.018 --> 18:42.989
WOMAN: Hell no! You ain't
getting out of here that easy.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.624
Spider?

18:46.058 --> 18:47.827
Girl, come here!

18:47.860 --> 18:50.163
(laughs) Look at you!

18:50.197 --> 18:51.164
Look at you!

18:51.198 --> 18:52.632
Damn. I can't believe you here.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.367
We thought you forgot
all about us.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.836
Come on, man.
I never forget y'all ugly asses.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.506
Hey, why'd they shut down
our old cell block?

18:59.539 --> 19:00.840
It flooded back in Sandy.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.041
This the first time we allowed

19:02.074 --> 19:03.543
back in here.
We been ten bitches

19:03.576 --> 19:04.877
in a bunk meant for two.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.145
Damn.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.815
This wifey?

19:08.848 --> 19:10.717
Damn!
Who me? No.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.118
Uh-uh. I don't get down
like that.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.886
I only do hot dogs,
sausages and Polishes.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.455
So calm down.
I don't do women.
Shut up.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.989
Don't you know
how to take a compliment?

19:17.023 --> 19:18.157
I'm just sayin'.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.493
This is
my assistant, Porsha.

19:20.527 --> 19:21.528
Mm-hmm.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.162
You really gonna do a concert?

19:23.196 --> 19:24.497
I'm-a do a little somethin'.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.699
You know, they only letting me
bring in two of my artists.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.034
I'm-a do a little show.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.536
Well, you bringing
Veronica, right?

19:29.569 --> 19:31.204
Her fine, bald ass.

19:31.238 --> 19:34.341
Uh-uh. I want to see Hakeem.
He sexy as hell!

19:34.374 --> 19:35.542
* Drip, drop, drip,
drippity drop... *

19:35.575 --> 19:37.244
All right, now,
that's my baby

19:37.277 --> 19:38.378
you talking 'bout.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.679
WOMAN:
See that?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.082
They follow
your every move, Cookie.

19:43.115 --> 19:45.418
Warden Meyers.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.720
Fancy.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.322
I see you got a lot
of equipment out there.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.891
I'm letting you bring in
one camera.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.159
You got
security clearance

19:53.192 --> 19:55.595
for two artists
and your assistant.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.764
It's nice
what you're doing.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.333
Thank you.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.669
Well, since you only let me
have two artists,

20:02.702 --> 20:05.004
I need to figure out
which one of these ladies

20:05.037 --> 20:06.939
I'm-a put up on that stage.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.275
Hey, where's Jezzy?

20:09.809 --> 20:12.845
I don't think
she wants to talk to you.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.013
Now, see,
that's where you're wrong.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.014
'Cause I always
promised her

20:15.047 --> 20:16.283
that when she got out,

20:16.316 --> 20:18.251
I was gonna make her a star.

20:18.285 --> 20:20.019
So, can I talk to her?

20:20.052 --> 20:22.455
Jezzy won't be getting out.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.293
SPIDER:
Jezzy caught a life bid

20:26.326 --> 20:28.795
taking out her bunkmate
over toothpaste.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.062
What?

20:30.096 --> 20:31.464
(scoffs)

20:31.498 --> 20:34.033
Damn, Jezzy.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.234
(sighs)

20:35.268 --> 20:37.236
RHONDA:
You did not have to do this.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.638
ANIKA: Oh, I know.
It's just...

20:38.671 --> 20:39.939
Oh.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.308
Oh, my goodness!

20:41.341 --> 20:42.575
(laughs)

20:42.609 --> 20:44.377
They're so precious.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.078
I love them. Thank you so much.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.415
You're so welcome. I...
Aw.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.383
...just wanted to give you
something to match

20:50.417 --> 20:52.385
this gorgeous house

20:52.419 --> 20:54.421
that Lucious gave you guys.
Aw.

20:54.454 --> 20:57.724
I know. I am telling you,
he is just obsessed

20:57.757 --> 20:59.426
with this grandchild.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.227
Oh, did I tell you

21:01.260 --> 21:03.996
that he actually refers to him
as "the heir"?

21:04.030 --> 21:06.966
(laughs)

21:09.302 --> 21:12.138
He is such the drama king.

21:12.171 --> 21:13.906
Wow.

21:13.940 --> 21:18.478
God, he would be furious
if he knew I was here, actually.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.479
(phone ringing)

21:19.512 --> 21:20.813
I'm gonna go grab that.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.281
We haven't
installed a line

21:22.315 --> 21:24.150
in here yet.
Sorry, I'll be right back.

21:24.183 --> 21:25.985
It's fine.

21:31.157 --> 21:33.693
MAN: Give a big Empire welcome
to multiple ASA winner,

21:33.726 --> 21:35.127
Skye Summers!
(crowd cheering)

21:35.161 --> 21:36.829
*

21:36.863 --> 21:39.766
* If I was a poet, I would

21:39.799 --> 21:43.002
* Write you a story
filled with *

21:43.035 --> 21:47.006
* Impossible glory
and pass it along... *

21:47.039 --> 21:49.342
LUCIOUS:
I see what you see in her.

21:49.376 --> 21:53.546
* But I'm just a voice who has

21:53.580 --> 21:57.484
* Words that are simple, with

21:57.517 --> 22:03.322
* No time for riddles,
this is my song *

22:05.592 --> 22:08.995
* For you, baby

22:09.028 --> 22:11.931
* Uh-huh.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.703
Hey, y'all. I know it's ASA day,

22:16.736 --> 22:20.239
but it's also a very special day
for Empire.

22:20.272 --> 22:22.909
I'm so proud to announce that,
as of today,

22:22.942 --> 22:25.745
Empire has acquired Swiftstream,

22:25.778 --> 22:28.881
the fastest and largest
music streaming service

22:28.915 --> 22:30.550
in the universe.

22:30.583 --> 22:33.152
(crowd cheering)

22:33.185 --> 22:37.924
We are making music history
here at Empire.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.225
Tweet that.

22:39.258 --> 22:40.727
(laughter)

22:40.760 --> 22:42.328
It brings me great pleasure

22:42.361 --> 22:45.832
to invite to the stage
Miss Mimi Whiteman.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.167
She's going to tell y'all
what's next

22:48.200 --> 22:52.004
and help y'all understand how
Empire is going to be positioned

22:52.038 --> 22:53.540
in this brave new world.

22:53.573 --> 22:57.510
Mimi Whiteman, y'all,
my business partner-in-crime!

22:57.544 --> 22:59.979
(crowd cheering)

23:03.382 --> 23:06.352
Thank you.
Thank you, Lucious.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.455
(laughs)

23:08.488 --> 23:10.857
"Business partner-in-crime."

23:10.890 --> 23:13.292
Hmm. I don't know
that I've ever been

23:13.325 --> 23:15.795
quite characterized
that way before.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.064
But before I get
to what's next,

23:18.097 --> 23:20.900
I do want to recognize a number
of my fellow board members

23:20.933 --> 23:22.301
who are here today.

23:22.334 --> 23:23.903
(crowd cheering)

23:23.936 --> 23:25.472
Most of all,

23:25.505 --> 23:28.441
I want to bring to the stage
someone that is...

23:28.475 --> 23:30.242
very important to me.

23:30.276 --> 23:34.046
As many of you know, I've been
surviving breast cancer.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.784
And I truly believe
that I would not be alive today

23:37.817 --> 23:39.652
if it were not
for this woman.

23:42.689 --> 23:45.291
She is my reason to live.

23:45.324 --> 23:49.095
She has seen me
through my darkest hours.

23:49.128 --> 23:53.566
Oh! She is my be-all
and my end-all.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.635
She's my lovely wife,

23:55.668 --> 23:59.438
Mrs. Camilla Marks Whiteman.

23:59.472 --> 24:00.807
(crowd cheering)

24:07.647 --> 24:10.349
Remember me, Lucious?

24:28.334 --> 24:29.769
MIMI:
The board deserves to know

24:29.802 --> 24:31.704
how Lucious Lyon
conducts his affairs.

24:31.738 --> 24:33.773
He seems to think he can
get away with anything.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.709
Extortion,
violence, murder.

24:36.743 --> 24:38.778
Empire is a public company.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.379
It's not his plaything anymore.

24:40.412 --> 24:41.881
Belongs to the shareholders.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.883
And by acquiring
Swiftstream,

24:43.916 --> 24:46.853
Empire is now the most powerful
music company in the world.

24:46.886 --> 24:49.455
It's even more reason
to check this man's power.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.123
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold up.

24:51.157 --> 24:55.828
Last time I checked, Mimi, you
and I were tandem on everything.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.964
That's right.

24:57.997 --> 25:01.167
So now all of you can see
what I saw and heard.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.402
LUCIOUS: No, to hell
with the damn board.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.805
I didn't need the board's
approval when I risked

25:05.838 --> 25:08.140
my life to build the company,
did I?

25:08.174 --> 25:10.643
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna
ask the board of directors

25:10.677 --> 25:13.012
for permission to move my pieces
on my chessboard.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.346
As a matter of fact,

25:14.380 --> 25:16.382
as soon as this deal closes,
I'm cleaning house.

25:16.415 --> 25:18.818
Whoever stood in opposition
against me, it's a wrap.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.587
They're out.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.824
MIMI: Ladies and
gentlemen of the board,

25:24.857 --> 25:28.828
I propose a vote
to remove Lucious Lyon as CEO

25:28.861 --> 25:30.529
and chairman of Empire.

25:30.563 --> 25:31.731
Let's convene

25:31.764 --> 25:34.100
for an emergency vote tonight
at 9:00 p.m.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.235
Please all be sure to be there.

25:39.438 --> 25:41.407
Camilla.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.242
I didn't see it coming.

25:43.275 --> 25:44.677
Lyon family controls
just under

25:44.711 --> 25:45.912
half the company, Pop.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.680
Now, even if
every one of us voted,

25:47.714 --> 25:48.948
it's not guaranteed
we're gonna win.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.583
We're gonna have
to lobby board members,

25:50.617 --> 25:52.619
get at least one more person
on our side.

25:52.652 --> 25:53.753
We need

25:53.786 --> 25:55.688
to reach
these board members.

25:55.722 --> 25:59.025
Get everybody,
every last body here.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.761
MAN: We're halfway through
nomination day.

26:01.794 --> 26:04.063
And here's Jason Derulo, back
to announce our next category.

26:04.096 --> 26:06.766
DERULO: Hey, y'all, I'm so turnt
right now 'cause I'm about to

26:06.799 --> 26:09.235
announce the ASA
Video of the Year nominees.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.470
Pyramid P for "Elemental,"

26:11.503 --> 26:13.405
Flighthouse
for "Cold Dead Hands,"

26:13.439 --> 26:16.242
Jamal and Hakeem Lyon
for "Ain't About the Money,"

26:16.275 --> 26:18.611
and-and Jamal Lyon for "Heavy."

26:18.645 --> 26:19.746
Wow!
That's dope.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.714
Two in one.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.650
Cheers. Cheers.
(laughs) Cheers. Cheers.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.484
MAN: Stay tuned to
the ASA live-stream...

26:25.517 --> 26:26.886
That's great.
It's so great.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.555
...for upcoming announcements
every hour on the hour.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.591
I saw you talking
to that guy at the bar.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.627
Who is he?

26:36.629 --> 26:38.097
I don't know.

26:38.130 --> 26:41.634
I didn't even
get his name.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.135
You know I adore
you, right?

26:45.371 --> 26:47.506
But you're into men. I know.

26:47.539 --> 26:50.142
I know.

26:50.176 --> 26:51.477
I'm sorry.

26:51.510 --> 26:52.679
It's okay.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.747
We only hooked up one time.

26:54.781 --> 26:58.851
It's not like I thought
we were all boo'd up, you know.

26:58.885 --> 27:00.286
Seriously?
(laughs)

27:00.319 --> 27:01.921
But don't get me wrong.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.690
Don't get me wrong.

27:03.723 --> 27:06.392
It was so beautiful.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.529
But I don't want to change you.

27:10.562 --> 27:13.599
And I know that you wouldn't
feel about a woman

27:13.632 --> 27:16.769
the way that
you felt about, um...

27:16.803 --> 27:18.771
Tell me his name again.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.807
Michael.

27:22.842 --> 27:26.846
No... I wouldn't.

27:26.879 --> 27:29.648
I know.

27:29.682 --> 27:31.417
(knocking)

27:37.757 --> 27:39.558
Aren't you going
to invite me in?

27:39.591 --> 27:41.427
What are you doing here?

27:43.429 --> 27:46.298
I guess you haven't heard yet.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.834
Heard what?

27:47.867 --> 27:49.702
You just disappeared.

27:49.736 --> 27:52.171
I ain't think I ever
was gonna see you again.

27:52.204 --> 27:55.174
Well, you could have tried
a little bit harder, Hakeem.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.676
Why didn't you?

27:57.710 --> 27:59.078
Because you left.

27:59.111 --> 28:01.513
You took my father's money,
and you bounced.

28:01.547 --> 28:03.315
I did not take
Lucious's dirty bribe.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.084
Yeah?
He's a filthy liar.

28:05.117 --> 28:06.485
I don't believe you.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.187
Ask your mother.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.256
Why? She wouldn't lie to me.

28:10.289 --> 28:13.425
Maybe you don't know her
as well as you think you do.

28:13.459 --> 28:17.329
But... if you've given up on us,
it doesn't matter.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.031
I ain't given up
on anything.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.933
I don't even know what
you talking about.

28:20.967 --> 28:24.436
Antony and Cleopatra, Hakeem.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.241
I still believe in you.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.544
You married?

28:32.578 --> 28:35.347
It's not what it looks like.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.183
Everything I did, I did for you.

28:37.216 --> 28:41.053
For us. You have to
trust and believe me.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.589
I can take you
to the next level, Hakeem.

28:45.624 --> 28:47.794
If you're ready
to go there.

28:57.837 --> 28:58.905
Where is he?

28:58.938 --> 29:00.272
I called, I texted.

29:00.306 --> 29:01.740
I haven't seen him
since he found out

29:01.774 --> 29:03.575
he didn't get
that ASA nomination.

29:03.609 --> 29:05.744
Yo.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.646
(Cookie sighs)

29:09.949 --> 29:11.617
(inmates murmuring)

29:13.285 --> 29:15.487
Oh, my God. That's
really something.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.926
So... so, Mom, we really
gonna perform here?

29:19.959 --> 29:24.396
I spent 17 years
of my life in here.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.733
It's a part of who I am.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.236
Now, come on, we're gonna
do a show for these ladies.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.603
(crowd cheering)

29:31.637 --> 29:34.006
Maybe most of the world
is watching the ASA nominations,

29:34.040 --> 29:37.910
but here at Wallace prison,
we are streaming live, y'all.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.478
(crowd cheering)
Yes!

29:39.511 --> 29:40.913
We had tweet after tweet,

29:40.947 --> 29:43.782
you guys, of people
who are not judging you

29:43.816 --> 29:46.152
for the choices
that landed you in here.

29:46.185 --> 29:48.320
They're not looking at you
as failures.

29:48.354 --> 29:49.655
(crowd murmuring agreement)

29:49.688 --> 29:53.192
They're looking at you
as the mothers

29:53.225 --> 29:57.029
and sisters and lovers
and dreamers that we all are.

29:57.063 --> 30:00.199
(crowd cheering)

30:03.469 --> 30:06.839
Today, um...

30:06.873 --> 30:10.376
started off...
kind of low for me.

30:10.409 --> 30:11.944
I, um...

30:11.978 --> 30:13.545
(laughs)

30:13.579 --> 30:17.116
I lost this huge festival
called...

30:17.149 --> 30:19.118
Cookie's Cookout.

30:19.151 --> 30:22.922
And I also... lost a...

30:25.657 --> 30:28.227
Let it out, Cookie!

30:28.260 --> 30:29.661
Speak on it!

30:29.695 --> 30:31.730
(crowd cheering)

30:36.068 --> 30:38.905
A broken heart...

30:38.938 --> 30:41.573
does not compare...

30:41.607 --> 30:44.176
to the struggles
of a life in here.

30:47.046 --> 30:49.215
I was locked away
from my babies, y'all.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.817
Spider, you know
what I'm talking about.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.319
Not able to see them grow up,

30:53.352 --> 30:56.688
praying every night
to be with them.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.360
Y'all are my real sisters,
for life.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.195
(crowd murmuring agreement)

31:03.229 --> 31:05.197
And I am so proud

31:05.231 --> 31:08.334
to introduce to you
one of my babies.

31:08.367 --> 31:11.070
Actually, the baby of
the babies. (laughs)

31:11.103 --> 31:13.172
Hakeem Lyon!

31:13.205 --> 31:14.206
(crowd cheering)

31:14.240 --> 31:15.908
(laughs):
Hey!

31:19.445 --> 31:22.348
(shouting, cheering)

31:22.381 --> 31:23.882
Look, y'all, I want to admit
that, you know,

31:23.916 --> 31:25.684
I was a little nervous
coming here today,

31:25.717 --> 31:28.520
just thinking about
my mom being in here.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.122
And I can't understand

31:30.156 --> 31:33.425
why my father not once
brought me here to see her.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.227
(crowd murmuring)

31:35.261 --> 31:36.228
Now, that's messed up, right?

31:36.262 --> 31:37.229
(crowd murmuring agreement)

31:37.263 --> 31:38.230
I said that's messed up, right?!

31:38.264 --> 31:39.598
CROWD:
Yeah!

31:39.631 --> 31:42.468
Yeah, you know, I had my mom
back in my life for about

31:42.501 --> 31:44.770
a year now, and
creating Lyon Dynasty

31:44.803 --> 31:47.306
has been one of the greatest
moments of my life.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.241
(crowd cheering)
Come on, let's get it.

31:49.275 --> 31:51.577
("Miracles" playing)
I love you!

31:51.610 --> 31:53.980
* It's the dynasty

31:54.013 --> 31:55.581
* You perform miracles

31:55.614 --> 31:57.316
* Miracles

31:57.349 --> 31:59.418
* So you wanna rule the world

31:59.451 --> 32:00.486
* Rule the world *

32:00.519 --> 32:01.954
* Walk across the ocean

32:01.988 --> 32:04.256
* Miracles

32:04.290 --> 32:05.591
* You can do it if you want

32:05.624 --> 32:06.925
* If you want *

32:06.959 --> 32:08.760
* 'Cause you perform miracles

32:08.794 --> 32:10.796
* Hey *

32:12.164 --> 32:13.732
* Hey *

32:13.765 --> 32:15.467
Tricky.

32:15.501 --> 32:17.103
* Hey... *

32:17.136 --> 32:19.838
Can I count on you to attend
the board vote tonight, Tricky?

32:21.940 --> 32:23.175
* Hey *

32:23.209 --> 32:25.811
* Do you believe in miracles?
* Yeah

32:25.844 --> 32:28.314
* When we're together,
it's miracles *

32:28.347 --> 32:29.681
(moans)

32:29.715 --> 32:32.084
(laughs)
Oh. You all right?

32:32.118 --> 32:33.119
Yeah.

32:33.152 --> 32:34.853
We got your vote, Edna?

32:34.886 --> 32:38.024
Honey, it was good, but wasn't
ten-million-dollars good.

32:38.057 --> 32:41.093
* Until my casket drop,
we'll remain unstoppable *

32:41.127 --> 32:43.962
* Like Mark Antony heading
across the Mediterranean *

32:43.996 --> 32:47.633
* To see his ebony Cleopatra,
embrace and taste her kiss *

32:47.666 --> 32:48.767
* Hey *

32:48.800 --> 32:50.836
* Do you believe in miracles?

32:50.869 --> 32:52.771
* Yeah, when we're together,
its miracles *

32:52.804 --> 32:54.540
* Hey *

32:54.573 --> 32:57.309
* You should let me
show you that *
* Show you that *

32:57.343 --> 32:58.544
* No, you should
let me show you that *

32:58.577 --> 33:00.046
* You perform miracles

33:00.079 --> 33:01.547
* Miracles

33:01.580 --> 33:04.050
* You can do it if you want

33:04.083 --> 33:06.952
* If you want *
* 'Cause you perform miracles

33:06.985 --> 33:08.887
* Miracles. *
(crowd cheering)

33:08.920 --> 33:10.889
I can't believe
what you're telling me, Andre.

33:10.922 --> 33:12.558
Come on,
let's go in here.

33:12.591 --> 33:15.061
So, she's having a board vote
to kick Lucious out tonight?

33:15.094 --> 33:15.994
At 9:00.

33:16.028 --> 33:17.296
HAKEEM:
Ma,

33:17.329 --> 33:18.297
what's going on?

33:18.330 --> 33:19.698
What's Dre doing here?

33:19.731 --> 33:22.000
Boy, did you know that Camilla
and Mimi got hitched?

33:22.034 --> 33:23.169
That's who she married?

33:23.202 --> 33:24.503
Damn, Hakeem.

33:24.536 --> 33:25.504
She said she didn't take
Lucious's money.

33:25.537 --> 33:26.505
She said you knew.

33:26.538 --> 33:27.906
She still bounced!

33:27.939 --> 33:29.675
And now she's trying
to bogart our company

33:29.708 --> 33:31.077
right from up under us.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.679
Thought you said Lyon Dynasty
was our company, Ma.

33:33.712 --> 33:34.880
Listen, we don't have time
for this, okay?

33:34.913 --> 33:36.148
Now, bottom line,
we need you both there

33:36.182 --> 33:37.983
to vote, or we lose
Empire tonight.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.218
Hell, we might lose it anyway.

33:39.251 --> 33:40.352
COOKIE:
Tonight? No, no, no.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.188
Dre, not tonight.
I can't leave here

33:42.221 --> 33:44.356
until I see Jezzy.

33:44.390 --> 33:45.657
Look, this is important to me.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.526
Is there something else
I can do?

33:48.927 --> 33:50.862
You can give us
your proxy.

33:50.896 --> 33:52.764
That means Hakeem or me

33:52.798 --> 33:54.032
can vote for you.

33:54.066 --> 33:55.267
I had the paperwork
drawn up.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.106
Step outside. Let me talk
to him for a second.

34:00.139 --> 34:03.309
Boy, sit your ass down.

34:07.479 --> 34:10.716
Lyon Dynasty is our company...

34:10.749 --> 34:12.618
but Empire is our legacy.

34:12.651 --> 34:15.287
And anybody that tries
to steal that from us

34:15.321 --> 34:16.855
is our enemy.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.224
Do you understand that?

34:19.258 --> 34:20.959
I know, Ma.

34:22.994 --> 34:25.131
You better.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.407
(scoffs)

34:35.441 --> 34:37.643
Well, well, well.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.278
It's the great Cookie Lyon.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.613
She used to be my family.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.382
Now she back for charity.

34:43.415 --> 34:46.918
I'm still your family, Jezz,
you know that.

34:46.952 --> 34:48.920
I asked the warden to
let me come see you.

34:48.954 --> 34:51.323
You didn't come
to my show.

34:51.357 --> 34:53.959
And what does it matter to you?

34:55.261 --> 34:56.962
Can you give us
a second?

34:59.498 --> 35:01.567
How the hell
you get life

35:01.600 --> 35:03.835
over some damn
toothpaste?

35:03.869 --> 35:05.671
I'm innocent, Cookie.

35:05.704 --> 35:06.972
Just like you.

35:08.006 --> 35:09.808
Jezz, look...

35:09.841 --> 35:11.910
I'm sorry I didn't
write, okay?

35:11.943 --> 35:15.447
It's... I-I was... setting
some stuff up, okay?

35:15.481 --> 35:17.249
It doesn't mean
I don't care.

35:17.283 --> 35:18.784
Really?

35:18.817 --> 35:20.486
'Cause a whole year went by,

35:20.519 --> 35:22.154
and nobody heard

35:22.188 --> 35:24.356
nothing from no Cookie Lyon.

35:24.390 --> 35:26.358
Except on TV,

35:26.392 --> 35:28.660
when you jumped around
in a monkey suit.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.962
Free Lucious?

35:30.996 --> 35:33.599
Black male incarceration?

35:33.632 --> 35:36.468
What about all us women
on lockdown, Cookie?

35:36.502 --> 35:39.171
The ones you ate with
and lived with?

35:39.205 --> 35:40.372
Okay, all right.

35:40.406 --> 35:42.140
Well, I'm here now. Okay?

35:42.174 --> 35:44.210
And you could be the voice
for that, Jezz.

35:44.243 --> 35:45.611
I could help you with that.

35:45.644 --> 35:48.847
Rhyming? I'm done with that.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.549
Go on, get back
to your empire, Cookie.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.083
You can't do
nothing for me.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.058
So, how we do?

36:00.091 --> 36:01.460
Where's Hakeem?

36:01.493 --> 36:02.894
HAKEEM: Hey, y'all,
what's good? I'm here.

36:04.596 --> 36:06.332
Good.
ANDRE:
Pop, you know Thirsty and I

36:06.365 --> 36:07.733
both stuck out. I'm sorry.

36:07.766 --> 36:10.236
We still need one board member
to vote with us, or we lose it.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.503
I'm good with Jago.

36:11.537 --> 36:12.571
Got it covered.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.840
Yes, sir.
Thank God you got Jago.

36:19.411 --> 36:20.879
SPOKESPERSON:
Shall we begin?

36:20.912 --> 36:22.147
Proceed.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.650
This emergency vote of
the board of trustees

36:24.683 --> 36:28.053
of Empire Enterprises has
been called by Mimi Whiteman.

36:28.086 --> 36:29.755
Ms. Whiteman,
you have the floor.

36:29.788 --> 36:32.391
I've already said
everything I have to say.

36:33.359 --> 36:34.660
Mr. Lyon?

36:34.693 --> 36:37.028
Let's vote.

36:37.062 --> 36:38.564
Ladies and gentlemen
of the board,

36:38.597 --> 36:41.767
as to the motion to remove
Lucious Lyon, how say you?

36:41.800 --> 36:44.603
Aye or nay?

36:44.636 --> 36:45.604
Anthony Trichter?

36:45.637 --> 36:46.605
Aye.

36:46.638 --> 36:48.707
Edna Piasecki?

36:48.740 --> 36:50.108
Aye.

36:50.141 --> 36:51.343
Jago Locke?

36:51.377 --> 36:52.611
Nay.
Ralph Anderson?

36:52.644 --> 36:53.612
Aye.
Lucious Lyon?

36:53.645 --> 36:54.780
Nay.

36:54.813 --> 36:55.681
Andre Lyon?
Nay.

36:55.714 --> 36:56.882
Jamal Lyon?
Nay.

36:56.915 --> 36:57.916
Hakeem Lyon?

37:08.594 --> 37:10.262
*

37:34.953 --> 37:37.423
Hakeem, no!

37:37.456 --> 37:39.190
Aye.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.998
SPOKESPERSON: Lucious Lyon,
the board of trustees has voted

37:47.032 --> 37:48.667
to removed you
as chairman and CEO

37:48.700 --> 37:49.968
of Empire Enterprises.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.303
Okay, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Uh...

37:51.337 --> 37:52.771
MIMI: Now that the
vote has been cast,

37:52.804 --> 37:54.306
I have another
announcement to make.

37:54.340 --> 37:55.641
As the new chairman
of this board,

37:55.674 --> 37:57.509
I am turning over my proxy
to my wife,

37:57.543 --> 37:58.777
Camilla Marks Whiteman.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.479
She'll be in charge
of the day-to-day

38:00.512 --> 38:03.849
while I'm at Rancho Mirage
undergoing chemo and radiation.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.925
QUESTLOVE:
Once again, this is Questlove,

38:13.959 --> 38:15.827
and we are almost at the end
of nomination day.

38:15.861 --> 38:18.664
But don't go anywhere, because
the big one is coming up,

38:18.697 --> 38:20.599
Song of the Year.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.300
JAMAL:
Ma, you want a drink?

38:22.334 --> 38:24.302
(sighs)

38:24.336 --> 38:26.438
No.

38:26.472 --> 38:28.874
Sure? Feel like
we all could use one.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.041
I...

38:30.075 --> 38:31.377
(gunshots)
(gasps)

38:31.410 --> 38:33.345
Stay right here. Don't move!

38:36.682 --> 38:37.816
(shouts)

38:39.985 --> 38:41.787
(panting)

38:41.820 --> 38:43.455
Please...

38:43.489 --> 38:46.392
put down the
gun, Lucious.

38:49.895 --> 38:52.664
All those years,

38:52.698 --> 38:55.266
selling CDs
out the back of a car...

38:57.268 --> 38:59.304
...selling keys,

38:59.337 --> 39:01.840
moving bodies,

39:01.873 --> 39:06.244
the enormity of damage
I've done to my soul...

39:06.277 --> 39:08.279
for what?!

39:09.748 --> 39:12.050
To give those
lousy, ungrateful

39:12.083 --> 39:15.487
sons of bitches
a better life?!

39:15.521 --> 39:17.589
For what?!

39:17.623 --> 39:18.557
I know.

39:18.590 --> 39:21.493
17 years?

39:21.527 --> 39:24.830
You sacrificed 17 years

39:24.863 --> 39:28.066
for what?!

39:28.099 --> 39:31.837
Look, Lucious,

39:31.870 --> 39:34.205
it's not over
for us, okay?

39:34.239 --> 39:37.208
We still own majority shares.

39:37.242 --> 39:39.277
Jamal is still on the label.

39:39.310 --> 39:42.013
You're still on the label.

39:42.047 --> 39:45.751
They're about to announce
Song of the Year.

39:45.784 --> 39:47.886
The last ASA of the day.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.621
Your favorite.

39:49.655 --> 39:52.558
(whispers):
Give me the gun.

39:54.660 --> 39:57.896
Lucious.

40:00.932 --> 40:03.234
Lucious...

40:03.268 --> 40:06.204
you got two sons downstairs,
okay?

40:06.237 --> 40:07.773
And they need you to be strong

40:07.806 --> 40:09.908
right now.

40:09.941 --> 40:12.444
Give me the gun.

40:17.115 --> 40:18.850
(inhales sharply)

40:24.456 --> 40:26.492
(sighs)

40:26.525 --> 40:29.495
Now, get your
ass together.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.497
Come on, pull
it together.

40:31.530 --> 40:34.032
You a Lyon.
Come on.

40:47.846 --> 40:49.848
(sobs):
I want him dead.

40:49.881 --> 40:52.784
No.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.953
No, you don't mean that.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.655
You don't mean that.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.128
(alarm wailing)

41:24.082 --> 41:26.652
(alarm continues wailing)

41:26.685 --> 41:29.020
Oh, my God, this damn alarm.

41:31.022 --> 41:33.224
I can't take this.

41:33.258 --> 41:34.292
(alarm stops)

41:34.325 --> 41:35.694
(scoffs) My God.

41:39.364 --> 41:42.100
What keeps setting
this thing off?

41:51.009 --> 41:53.044
(Rhonda gasps)

41:53.078 --> 41:55.681
(dramatic choral music playing)

42:03.555 --> 42:05.657
JOEL MADDEN: Hey, what's up,
everybody? I'm Joel Madden.

42:05.691 --> 42:07.158
NICOLE RICHIE:
And I'm Nicole Richie.

42:07.192 --> 42:10.261

42:26.745 --> 42:28.546
in the history of
the American Sound Awards

42:28.580 --> 42:30.882
that a father and son
are going toe-to-toe.

42:30.916 --> 42:31.883
(chuckles)

42:31.917 --> 42:34.219
(Jamal chuckles)

42:34.252 --> 42:36.187
Congratulations, gentlemen.

42:36.221 --> 42:38.256
I'll call Rhonda,
give her the good news.

42:40.959 --> 42:42.460
Stay tuned, everybody.

42:44.896 --> 42:47.565
Ain't that a bitch?

42:50.736 --> 42:53.972

43:36.547 --> 43:37.615
Yeah.
