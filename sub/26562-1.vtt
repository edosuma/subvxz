00:32.324 --> 00:35.410
[girl muttering]

00:35.494 --> 00:37.371
[panting continues]

01:23.750 --> 01:26.503
[school bell rings]

01:34.928 --> 01:37.097
[students chattering]

01:54.865 --> 01:56.366
[Jude] Okay, what's the blue light?

01:56.450 --> 01:57.367
[Nell] Green.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.660
[Jude exclaims] Jesus, green then.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.287
[Nell] It's just the light
at the end of his dock.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.997
-[Jude] That's it?
-[Nell] No.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.124
Please, no. I'm begging you.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.209
I have 55 minutes.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.211
There's been like, ten movies made of it.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.546
Nell.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.799
It's everything, I guess.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.051
It's hope.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.845
It's something you want
but know that you'll never get

02:16.928 --> 02:18.680
because it doesn't exist.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.475
Or maybe missing everything you've lost.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.477
Please, Nell.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.062
It's right.

02:25.729 --> 02:30.275
Okay, what about this...
"orgiastic future"?

02:31.652 --> 02:34.738
Yeah, well, that's not happening.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.156
Yeah, but it's in the book.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.407
Stop it, Jude.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.493
Finish the essay.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.746
Okay, this hope not existing,
that's what Tom is feeling?

02:42.829 --> 02:44.247
-Nick.
-[scoffs] Nick.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.874
Shit! Okay.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.502
Just make it sound original.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.004
You'll be fine. It's really open-ended.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.297
[school bell rings]

02:52.381 --> 02:54.091
I gotta go. Good luck.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.884
Wait. You going tonight?

02:56.093 --> 02:58.428
Uh, if my dad gets back in time,
I'll meet you there.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.600
-Which egg?
-East.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.352
East.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.819
-Jude.
-Hey, Mr. Wallace.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.529
Don't you have statistics now?

03:15.612 --> 03:18.657
I do. Yeah, but I heard
Mr. Reeves is out sick.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.909
-There's a sub.
-[sighs]

03:21.410 --> 03:26.248
The thing is, Mr. Wallace, um, I have to
finish this for Mr. Foster's class.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.083
-Uh-huh.
-It's a third of our grade.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.253
You understand that
we're having this conversation right now?

03:31.920 --> 03:33.713
-Sir?
-It's one thing to skip a class,

03:33.797 --> 03:35.590
but now I've told you to go to that class,

03:35.674 --> 03:37.384
so now it's, sort of,
becoming another thing.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.679
Right. Yeah.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.017
The thing is, Mr. Wallace,

03:46.101 --> 03:48.937
I think it might be better for me to
get in trouble for skipping class,

03:49.020 --> 03:51.022
but be able to finish the essay?

03:52.649 --> 03:54.109
[chuckles]

03:54.192 --> 03:56.319
Jude, you're a weird kid.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.114
But we've both got a job to do, Jude.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.782
Your job is to go to class.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.744
My job is to be a guidance counselor
and tell you to go to class,

04:03.827 --> 04:06.747
and also to help you get out
into the real world in one piece.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.373
-Got it?
-Yeah.

04:08.457 --> 04:09.750
Okay.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.668
[sighs]

04:12.627 --> 04:15.005
You had a terrible summer, Jude. I know.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.340
I'm sorry I didn't get
to your father's funeral,

04:17.424 --> 04:18.800
the school wanted somebody to be there.

04:18.884 --> 04:22.012
But you... you still got to follow
the rules like everybody else. Okay?

04:22.554 --> 04:25.599
And trust me, there are
much larger hurdles out there

04:25.682 --> 04:27.642
than a paper for Mr. Foster.

04:39.488 --> 04:40.697
Okay.

04:41.364 --> 04:45.494
Now, we know that there
are marbles in the jar,

04:45.577 --> 04:49.122
but if we make the jar opaque,

04:49.581 --> 04:53.794
is it still possible to say
that there's a one in nine chance that...

04:53.877 --> 04:57.839
Excuse me? Mr... What's his name?

04:59.341 --> 05:00.634
Jude.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.303
Hey, Jude.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.811
-Am I disturbing you?
-No.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.563
Good. Then maybe you
can answer the question.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.482
-I was listening, sir.
-Terrific.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.192
What did I say?

05:19.986 --> 05:21.112
[sighs]

05:21.196 --> 05:22.739
You have a jar of marbles,
we can't see through.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.825
And you want to know
if there's a one in nine chance

05:24.908 --> 05:27.202
that the number of marbles
starts with a one through nine.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.787
But that's wrong.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.121
I'm sorry?

05:30.205 --> 05:32.666
It's wrong. There's actually a 30% chance

05:32.749 --> 05:34.835
that the number of marbles
starts with a one,

05:34.918 --> 05:38.046
and about a 20% chance
that it starts with a two and so on.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.798
It's called Benford's Law.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.926
Mr. Reeves hasn't gotten
to it yet, but he will.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.386
So, it's not your fault,

05:44.469 --> 05:47.097
'cause it's probably
not in his class book yet.

05:54.521 --> 05:59.651
So, if we turn the jar... opaque,

05:59.734 --> 06:02.696
now we can't see the marbles.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.781
-[school bell rings]
-That was awesome. Are you kidding me?

06:04.864 --> 06:06.950
I like how he went back to the marbles.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.493
Oh, it was fantastic.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.161
-How'd you know what it was?
-I didn't really.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.372
I think I heard it
on a radio show or something.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.708
-I... I don't know. It just came out.
-You serious?

06:14.791 --> 06:17.168
-You don't even know if it's real?
-I think it is, but no.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.545
-[laughing]
-Not really.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.338
-Did you finish?
-Barely.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.465
Hey, Judie.

06:23.842 --> 06:24.968
[Derek chuckling]

06:25.051 --> 06:27.345
-[snaps]
-That was great.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.681
You finally found someone
that you could out-geek.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.391
[snickers]

06:32.267 --> 06:34.436
-Shut up, Derek.
-He made it up.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.062
Seriously, Judie?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.898
No, it's real, I think.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.650
I thought it was cool.

06:50.368 --> 06:51.870
[typing]

07:03.548 --> 07:05.050
-[timer ticking]
-Nice.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.721
No! No, no, no.

07:09.804 --> 07:10.889
You go away.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.183
[chuckles] Mmm.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.684
Wait, what? What is that?

07:14.768 --> 07:15.852
Just a hunch.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.649
I'd tuck that rook back inside
if I were you.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.108
Never.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.362
[timer stops]

07:25.445 --> 07:26.988
Wait, what?

07:27.530 --> 07:29.240
It was the rook, I think.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.117
Yep. [exhales]

07:31.493 --> 07:33.828
Let's play again. Reset the clocks.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.374
[winding timer]

07:37.457 --> 07:39.084
[knock on door]

07:39.167 --> 07:40.085
[door opens]

07:41.878 --> 07:43.505
We picking Nell up tonight?

07:43.588 --> 07:45.507
-She can't come.
-Why not?

07:45.590 --> 07:48.343
Uh, she's babysitting her sister.

07:48.426 --> 07:52.347
She said that if her dad
gets back in time, she'd try.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.642
So what kind of party is this tonight?

07:56.559 --> 07:57.477
What do you mean?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.522
I mean, what kind of party is it?

08:01.231 --> 08:03.483
Just a big party. I don't... [chuckles]

08:03.566 --> 08:06.987
The Muftics are moving,
and David thought it'd be cool

08:07.070 --> 08:09.114
to have a big party in their empty house.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.032
Wow. They just rebuilt that house.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.493
Yeah, but David's dad
got a job in Atlanta.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.371
Well, I hope they don't burn
down the kitchen in Atlanta too.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.206
[laughs]

08:20.208 --> 08:22.127
So the parents will be home then, right?

08:22.252 --> 08:23.712
Probably. I don't know.

08:24.379 --> 08:25.714
-Beer?
-No.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.507
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

08:31.553 --> 08:32.929
Jude.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.681
-Yeah?
-Um...

08:36.891 --> 08:40.311
This isn't one of those
rainbow parties, is it?

08:40.895 --> 08:41.980
What?

08:42.313 --> 08:45.400
You know, where the girls put
different color lipsticks on,

08:45.483 --> 08:49.320
-and the boys try to sleep--
-Oh, my God, Mom. No!

08:49.404 --> 08:52.032
-Jude?
-Mom, that doesn't even exist.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.825
Well, they do.
I read about it in the paper.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.870
-No, Mom. It's just a myth.
-It was on a parent's blog as well.

08:56.953 --> 09:00.498
Mom, I'm begging you, please.
Don't talk about it. Please, it's made up!

09:00.582 --> 09:02.792
Okay. I'm just trying to be
a well-informed mother.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.128
That's fake, I promise. [sighs]

09:06.880 --> 09:08.673
[indistinct chatter]

09:14.179 --> 09:15.430
[boy] Whose house is this?

09:16.556 --> 09:18.767
[Megan] Is the whole school
coming to this party?

09:18.850 --> 09:22.395
Yeah. They have a rule: if you invite
any kids, you have to invite all of them.

09:23.021 --> 09:23.938
Really?

09:24.022 --> 09:25.982
Mom, no. That ended in fourth grade.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.277
Maybe I should just say hi to the Muftics.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.487
Mom, please.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.739
Just to wish them well, to see them off.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.407
Mom, I got to go.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.451
-Okay, call me when you need a lift.
-[car honking]

09:36.534 --> 09:38.078
Hey, Judie!

09:40.538 --> 09:41.790
[sighs]

09:42.916 --> 09:43.750
Hey.

09:45.168 --> 09:47.045
The world can be full of pricks.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.588
Try to avoid them.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.173
Okay, Mom. I'll call you later.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.719
[indistinct chatter]

09:56.346 --> 09:58.765
[boy] Speakers! Speakers!

10:12.362 --> 10:13.530
Okay.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.742
Hey, kids. Don't just hide in here.

10:17.826 --> 10:18.910
[laughter]

10:25.708 --> 10:26.751
Jesus!

10:26.835 --> 10:28.503
I know. There are kids
here from everywhere.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.754
Who brought them?

10:29.838 --> 10:31.422
Nobody knows. They all just showed up.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.424
Derek and June
and that group are headed in.

10:33.508 --> 10:34.342
Shit.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.845
-Where are your parents?
-They're already in Atlanta.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.721
I'm staying with my grandmother
for the next week.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.473
-[Kent] Hey.
-Hey.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.142
Looks like your party got hijacked.

10:42.225 --> 10:44.227
-Yeah.
-Oh, okay.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.603
There's nothing to do but ride it out.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.689
Will you guys hang out
and help me clean up after?

10:47.772 --> 10:49.232
Mom wants me home by 11:00.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.192
-Hopefully they'll be gone by then.
-[scoffs]

10:53.653 --> 10:54.737
Who brought the keg?

10:54.904 --> 10:57.073
[David] I don't know. Some kid just
dragged it into the bathroom.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.533
Okay, well, you know what?

10:59.033 --> 11:00.910
I need to go to the bathroom.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.913
-[hip-hop blasting on speakers]
-Jesus.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.291
[crowd cheering]

11:22.932 --> 11:24.934
I don't even remember. Was this David's?

11:27.937 --> 11:29.188
[Kent] No. Sister.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.735
[sighs]

11:36.696 --> 11:38.031
[Jude] Parents', I guess.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.074
I think I'm going to go.

11:40.158 --> 11:41.951
-Why?
-'Cause this blows,

11:42.035 --> 11:43.369
and maybe Nell won't even show up.

11:43.453 --> 11:46.789
-Why not?
-She has to stay with her little sister.

11:47.665 --> 11:51.002
Why did you laugh at school today
when Derek called me a geek?

11:52.670 --> 11:55.006
-I didn't.
-Yeah, you did.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.343
Jesus.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.594
What?

12:01.554 --> 12:02.722
[Kent] It's huge.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.933
Who could have this many clothes?

12:05.642 --> 12:08.019
[Jude] David's mom, I guess.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.151
They have a closet inside of a closet.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.279
Look, David's rich, I think.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.031
[Jude chuckles]

12:21.449 --> 12:22.283
Let's get out of here.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.452
-Whoa. Whoa.
-What?

12:24.994 --> 12:25.995
[laughs]

12:26.079 --> 12:27.705
Great. I'm going back down.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.582
No. Come on. Let's look at these.

12:29.666 --> 12:30.667
[Jude scoffs]

12:34.462 --> 12:36.422
[both laugh]

12:36.506 --> 12:37.840
Nice!

12:40.593 --> 12:42.428
Probably David's dad's,
from before the Internet.

12:42.512 --> 12:43.721
What do you got?

12:44.138 --> 12:45.723
[Jude] Jesus, Derek.

12:45.807 --> 12:46.891
What is it, Judie?

12:46.975 --> 12:49.560
-Give 'em.
-[Derek laughing]

12:49.644 --> 12:51.312
David work himself silly to these?

12:51.396 --> 12:52.981
This is his parents' bedroom.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.524
Gross.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.567
Where's your girlfriend, Judie?

12:59.112 --> 13:00.405
She'll be here.

13:00.655 --> 13:01.948
Okay.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.202
[electronic music playing]

13:11.499 --> 13:13.584
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

13:14.544 --> 13:15.420
Hey, kids!

13:16.879 --> 13:18.047
Come up here.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.549
Oh, shit.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.635
Derek's just going to torture them.

13:23.428 --> 13:24.762
Maybe better them than us.

13:24.846 --> 13:26.139
Ah, come on.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.858
[Derek] All right, settle down.
Get into a circle.

13:37.191 --> 13:40.611
We are going to play a game.
There are only two redheads in this deck.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.447
Real redheads, I've checked.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.700
Everybody gets a card,
but the two who get the real redheads

13:45.783 --> 13:47.535
either make out
in front of us for three minutes

13:47.618 --> 13:49.829
or go in the closet for seven minutes.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.751
But what if two guys get the red card?

13:55.001 --> 13:57.128
Well, a game's a game.
I guess there's no exceptions.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.922
No. No way do I want to
look at naked old people.

14:00.006 --> 14:03.634
You're saying you don't,
which is cool, but you do.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.679
All right. Sit down, kiddos.

14:09.015 --> 14:12.727
Black. Brown. Ah, blonde, nice.

14:12.810 --> 14:13.978
Brown.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.397
Red! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

14:16.647 --> 14:19.734
Oh, no. No, no. Sit right back down.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.153
[Derek] One gone.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.283
-You taking her place?
-[Jude] Shut up, Derek.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.535
-I just want to look at something.
-[Derek] No.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.662
You're either in or you're out.
And now you're in, Judie.

14:31.746 --> 14:33.206
All right, new game.
Give me back the cards.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.126
-Hey. Let me look at those.
-You saw them already.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.420
[June] Hey, brainiac.
You want to see the cards?

14:40.463 --> 14:41.881
Play the game.

14:43.883 --> 14:44.884
Fine.

14:48.054 --> 14:48.888

14:54.102 --> 14:55.311

15:00.858 --> 15:02.693
-Hey!
-You're either in or you're out.

15:02.944 --> 15:05.780
So, all the way around.
No reds, so we keep on going.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.449
Black. Blonde.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.910
Black. Brown.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.413
Oh! Red!

15:13.496 --> 15:14.914
Red for Judie.

Shit. Wow.

15:26.634 --> 15:30.096
Okay, we're not making out, so...
let's go sit in the closet.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.517
[Derek] Come on, Judie, into the closet.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.602
Let's go, Judie!

15:39.689 --> 15:41.732
[inhales sharply] Shit.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.569

I wasn't going to.

-No.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.653
I have a girlfriend.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.572
I know. Bell.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.574
-Nell.
-Whatever.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.744
Do you have a watch?

[scoffs]

16:37.914 --> 16:39.999
Uh, I have a phone.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.299
Yeah. [sighs]

I'll let you touch me, if you want.

[Thomas] I'm going to try to get a beer.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.164
Aren't you dating Derek?

17:20.623 --> 17:22.875
[scoffs] Not really.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.835
Oh.

17:27.922 --> 17:30.508
I'm sorry he calls you Judie all the time.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.261
It's okay.
I've been hearing it since, like...

17:33.344 --> 17:35.846
[chuckles] second grade.

17:35.930 --> 17:38.015
And you do it too.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.643
Yeah.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.481
Your folks name you after that song?

17:46.315 --> 17:48.109
No. There's a book.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.527
Called Jude?

17:49.610 --> 17:50.778
Yeah.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.488
I've never read it though.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.785
Is it true that you made up
that thing in class?

17:58.160 --> 18:00.288
Sort of. Yeah.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.583
That was cool.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.633
-Is Kent gay?
-[chuckles]

18:12.717 --> 18:14.176
No. Why?

18:14.510 --> 18:16.470
'Cause he never dates anybody.

18:17.972 --> 18:21.225
Yeah, but I don't think
that makes him gay.

18:21.309 --> 18:24.061
That makes him
a regular high-school junior.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.022
Yeah.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.276
I know he made out with a girl.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.070
A woman, really.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.405
Who?

18:37.158 --> 18:38.159
Someone's mom.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.120
No way! Who?

What? No. What kid?

-[Megan] What party?
-Then why do the police think you did it?

23:52.598 --> 23:54.683
Why are there people
saying they saw you do it?

23:54.767 --> 23:55.726
Do what?

23:55.809 --> 23:57.061
Stab him.

How are you here, Dad?

24:04.693 --> 24:06.487
What do you mean how am I here?

24:07.905 --> 24:09.448
Where the hell am I supposed to be?

-Some fancy all-girls school.

-I don't know.

There's not another way
out of that closet?

in there before either.

30:32.914 --> 30:35.167
-How did you get here?
-I don't know.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.002
We were in a closet.

30:37.461 --> 30:39.838
"We"? Who came with you?

30:40.422 --> 30:42.424
-June.
-June?

30:42.841 --> 30:44.593
-O'Neill?
-Johnson.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.347
Well, you better get the hell back.

30:48.638 --> 30:49.890
How?

30:50.265 --> 30:52.642
-Where is the closet?
-David Muftic's.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.480
-[engine starts]
-Mr. Wallace?

30:56.563 --> 30:58.273
Why did you hit me?

31:02.027 --> 31:04.112
Is it true that Derek's dead?

31:05.614 --> 31:06.615
Yes.

31:09.159 --> 31:11.078
The police said I did it.

31:11.787 --> 31:12.871
Yep.

31:14.831 --> 31:16.291
You're in the wrong place, Jude.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.087
[tires screeching]

32:07.259 --> 32:08.260
Get out.

32:09.678 --> 32:10.595
What?

32:11.346 --> 32:12.848
Get out. Get out of here.

32:13.557 --> 32:14.391
How?

32:14.474 --> 32:17.102
I don't know. Try the closet.
Just get out.

32:26.903 --> 32:27.737
What?

32:28.822 --> 32:31.032
I have to get home, Mr. Wallace.

32:31.658 --> 32:32.951
You sure do.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.550
[line ringing]

32:53.889 --> 32:55.390
[police radio chatter]

32:56.433 --> 32:58.477
[Officer Meade] Well, they're not home
or they're not here.

33:04.941 --> 33:06.818
Okay, we're going to stay here.
You guys can take off.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.070
Dad's upstairs. Kid's still missing.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.326
-[gate rattles]
-[dogs barking]

33:46.274 --> 33:47.484
Hey, he's across the street!

33:49.569 --> 33:51.571
[officer] You guys go up, we'll go down.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.265
[door closes]

34:18.515 --> 34:20.809
[footsteps]

34:21.726 --> 34:24.187
[sirens wailing in distance]

34:57.721 --> 34:59.514
[David's dad] Get your ass up here!

34:59.598 --> 35:01.099
[David] I'm coming, Dad.

35:01.182 --> 35:03.310
[David's dad] You brought
the police into our house?

35:03.393 --> 35:05.478
[David] I didn't bring them here.
Some kid got hurt in the park.

35:05.562 --> 35:07.939
[David's dad] Some kid got killed,
and they came from here!

35:08.023 --> 35:09.441
Get out here!

35:15.280 --> 35:17.032
-Who was the kid?
-[David] Which kid?

35:17.115 --> 35:19.534
-[David's dad] Jude.
-[David] Nobody. He's a douchebag.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.036
[David's dad] Then why did you invite him?

35:21.119 --> 35:22.746
[David] I didn't! He just showed up.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.664
[David's dad] Then why
didn't you get him to leave?

35:24.748 --> 35:27.208
[David] I don't know, Dad.
He's just a weird, creepy kid.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.585
Nobody even pays attention to him.

35:28.668 --> 35:32.213
[David's dad] Well, the weird, creepy kid
killed Derek after leaving our house.

35:32.297 --> 35:34.924
-[David] It's not my fault, Dad.
-[David's dad] No, it is your fault.

35:35.008 --> 35:38.011
You let kids in here you didn't know,
kids you didn't like.

35:38.094 --> 35:42.432
And you let it get out of control.
And that is your fault.

35:42.515 --> 35:44.100
[hip-hop playing]

35:44.184 --> 35:45.143
Hey, Kent.

35:45.769 --> 35:46.686
Hey.

35:46.770 --> 35:47.771
Where's, Jude?

35:48.271 --> 35:49.939
Uh, we don't know.

35:50.440 --> 35:53.735
I think he might have, uh, disappeared.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.404
What?

35:56.488 --> 35:57.906
They were playing that game,
Seven In Heaven,

35:57.989 --> 36:00.325
where you have to go into
a closet for seven minutes with someone...

36:00.408 --> 36:03.370
-Or they have to make out.
-So Jude had to go in with June.

36:04.079 --> 36:05.747
-June?
-Yeah.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.208
And they didn't really come out.

36:08.792 --> 36:10.085
Why did he go in with her?

36:10.293 --> 36:11.586
It's not like that, Nell.

36:13.129 --> 36:14.964
Oh, Derek made them.
They didn't have a choice.

36:15.131 --> 36:17.175
But how did they "not come out"?

36:17.258 --> 36:19.761
We don't know yet.
We'll find them though.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.763
-Are they hiding?
-We don't know.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.058
But are they still here, Kent?

36:25.308 --> 36:27.394
That's what we're trying to figure out.
But we don't know.

36:29.187 --> 36:32.524
Well, you do know there are
a couple of cops outside?

36:32.691 --> 36:34.067
-A couple?
-Oh, God.

36:34.150 --> 36:36.861
-[knocking on door]
-[Kent] Don't open that door.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.072
-[knocking continues]
-[Officer Meade] This is the police.

36:39.155 --> 36:40.615
-Open the door.
-[boy] Upstairs!

36:40.699 --> 36:42.492
If they had a warrant,
they would have said so.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.577
[pounding on door]

36:44.661 --> 36:46.746
Open the door.

36:46.830 --> 36:49.249
That's bad for David.
That's really bad for David's parents.

36:52.794 --> 36:53.628
Hi.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.755
You're not the kid I talked to before.

36:55.839 --> 36:57.132
No. I'm different.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.634
Open the door, son.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.761
Um, everything is fine here, really.

37:01.845 --> 37:03.555
Did the music get turned too loud again?

37:04.055 --> 37:05.265
Open the door.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.517
We told you to keep it down,
and you didn't.

37:07.600 --> 37:08.768
Now open the door.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.729
No. No, really. Everything is fine here.

37:10.812 --> 37:12.105
We're great. How are you?

37:13.732 --> 37:14.858
Open the door.

37:14.941 --> 37:18.111
Um, I'm going to have to ask
if you have a warrant right now.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.532
-How old are you?
-Sixteen.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.701
Is there any alcohol
being served in there?

37:24.826 --> 37:26.035
Not that I've seen. No.

37:26.619 --> 37:27.495
What's your name?

37:28.121 --> 37:29.038
Luke.

37:29.330 --> 37:31.958
Listen, Luke.
You're going to open the door.

37:32.667 --> 37:35.336
We're going to come inside
and make sure everything is okay. Okay?

37:35.962 --> 37:38.047
Otherwise, everything escalates.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.133
Do you understand?

37:40.467 --> 37:44.179
Um, well, we should probably
take a vote or something first.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.096
Just one sec.

37:45.889 --> 37:47.807
Okay, there's two cops outside.

37:47.891 --> 37:50.727
My brother says this happens sometimes.
You just got to wait them out.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.395
Otherwise, everyone's
parents are getting called,

37:52.479 --> 37:54.022
and there could be
booze problems for David.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.982
So for now, keep the music off,

37:56.191 --> 37:58.193
everybody start cleaning up,
but nobody leave.

38:00.862 --> 38:02.655
Hey, everybody.

38:02.739 --> 38:04.449
Let's go.
Let's help me clean up my house.

38:04.532 --> 38:05.617
[kids muttering]

38:07.285 --> 38:08.286
[intercept tone]

38:08.369 --> 38:11.456
[automated voice] <i>The number you have</i>
<i>reached is a non-working number.</i>

38:11.539 --> 38:13.333
<i>Please check the number and dial again.</i>

38:13.416 --> 38:14.793
[intercept tone]

38:15.210 --> 38:17.295
[David's dad] This was
supposed to be 15 to 20 kids.

38:17.378 --> 38:18.671
I agreed to buy you a keg.

38:18.755 --> 38:21.549
And now it's... I don't know how many kids
and one of them is dead.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.177
You know how much trouble
I could get in for this?

38:24.260 --> 38:25.929
[David] I'm sorry, Dad.

39:07.220 --> 39:08.972
Holy shit, you little bastard.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.431
Dad, he's here in the stairs.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.433
-[David's dad] What? Where? Which stairs?
-[David] Back!

39:43.548 --> 39:45.008
[barking]

39:47.260 --> 39:49.512
[dog growling]

41:11.928 --> 41:12.929
Are we friends?

41:13.513 --> 41:14.597
No.

41:16.265 --> 41:18.017
-Never?
-Never.

41:18.685 --> 41:20.228
Not even when we were younger?

41:20.520 --> 41:22.271
I didn't even know you
when I was younger, and no.

41:22.939 --> 41:24.273
Derek was my friend.

41:24.899 --> 41:26.484
-Really?
-Yes, really.

41:28.194 --> 41:30.905
I didn't do anything to Derek.

41:31.114 --> 41:32.907
They saw you do it, you asshole!

41:33.074 --> 41:34.951
-Did you?
-No. I wasn't there.

41:35.034 --> 41:36.828
-Where?
-At the park!

41:36.911 --> 41:38.579
It wasn't me. I promise.

41:39.789 --> 41:40.999
You're a twisted kid.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.292
You've always been a little twisted kid.

41:43.376 --> 41:45.294
-Always?
-Yes, always!

41:45.545 --> 41:46.671
Jesus!

41:47.797 --> 41:49.215
-I'm calling the cops.
-Please, don't.

41:50.049 --> 41:51.009
I...

41:52.844 --> 41:57.056
I guess we weren't ever friends,
but I can prove you can trust me.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.349
How?

42:01.310 --> 42:02.937
You wet the bed until sixth grade.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.522
Oh, bullshit!

42:05.857 --> 42:07.567
And I never told.

42:11.487 --> 42:13.364
And you made out with Mrs. Brenner.

42:18.828 --> 42:19.912
You know June Johnson?

42:22.206 --> 42:23.249
Yeah.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.793
-You know where she lives?
-Yeah.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.128
Where?

42:28.379 --> 42:29.380
Dudson and Third.

42:29.756 --> 42:30.965
Corner, I think.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.134
I didn't hurt Derek. Swear.

42:33.676 --> 42:35.470
And just so you know...

42:37.430 --> 42:39.098
you were my best friend.

42:48.983 --> 42:51.360
[quiet chattering]

42:51.444 --> 42:52.695
[girl] Oh, wow.

43:33.820 --> 43:35.947
So we get a warrant.
They're a bunch of kids.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.949
-Who knows what they're doing in there?
-We can't.

43:38.032 --> 43:39.033
Why?

43:39.117 --> 43:41.369
Because I already called in
that there was no booze.

43:41.786 --> 43:43.204
So we say we saw it now?

43:43.287 --> 43:45.414
How? Through a crack in the open window?

43:45.873 --> 43:47.208
Who cares? We just say.

43:48.292 --> 43:50.002
There are only three judges in this town,

43:50.086 --> 43:52.713
and more than likely
one of their kids is in there.

43:52.922 --> 43:54.006
Look.

43:54.590 --> 43:56.551
Every one of those kid's cameras is on us.

43:56.801 --> 43:59.053
Some judge will sign a warrant,
I'm telling you.

43:59.137 --> 44:03.975
No. No underage drinking,
no 911 calls, just noise complaints.

44:04.225 --> 44:05.560
No warrant.

44:06.853 --> 44:08.354
But we got something better
than a warrant.

44:09.730 --> 44:10.773
You recognize that car?

44:13.651 --> 44:14.610
I don't know.

44:14.777 --> 44:16.529
I've put a thousand tickets on that car.

44:18.239 --> 44:19.907
It's Judy Dragle's kid.

44:19.991 --> 44:21.909
-Oh, boy.
-Yep.

44:46.350 --> 44:47.518
[yells]

44:48.102 --> 44:50.271
What the hell is wrong with you?

44:50.438 --> 44:51.272
June!

44:51.355 --> 44:53.149
You left me there, you piece of shit!

44:53.232 --> 44:55.026
Stop! I thought you said
you were getting a drink.

44:55.109 --> 44:57.320
-You left me there!
-I'm sorry! I swear.

44:57.403 --> 44:58.779
I was getting beat up.

45:00.031 --> 45:01.282
[panting]

45:03.784 --> 45:04.994
What happened to you?

45:05.077 --> 45:07.163
-A bunch of guys attacked me.
-Who?

45:07.246 --> 45:10.166
I don't know. They just surrounded me
and started grabbing at me

45:10.249 --> 45:11.542
before I could get away.

45:16.047 --> 45:18.090
-Are you okay?
-No.

45:18.507 --> 45:20.009
Why were you up in the tree?

45:20.092 --> 45:21.510
Because those guys were chasing me.

45:21.594 --> 45:25.222
And I lost my keys
and they kept coming back to look for me.

45:27.892 --> 45:30.394
This might not even be your house,
you know.

45:31.938 --> 45:33.272
This is my house.

45:33.356 --> 45:34.649
June.

45:35.191 --> 45:37.693
We're not where you think we are.

45:38.402 --> 45:40.571
-What are you talking about?
-We're somewhere else.

45:40.655 --> 45:43.366
Somewhere the same but different.

45:43.449 --> 45:45.785
And I... I don't think
you should go in that house.

45:45.868 --> 45:48.663
Shut up, Judie. And come here
and help me get into my home.

45:57.505 --> 45:58.381
Go!

46:00.466 --> 46:02.385
[inhales sharply]

46:14.146 --> 46:16.732
[Mexican hat dance music ringtone playing]

46:17.608 --> 46:18.901
What the hell are you doing?

46:18.985 --> 46:20.403
[breathing heavily]

46:21.904 --> 46:23.114
Kent?

46:24.281 --> 46:25.574
I think he's in trouble.

46:25.700 --> 46:27.618
What are you talking about?

46:28.577 --> 46:30.496
I think something really
messed up has happened.

46:30.579 --> 46:31.664
Look.

46:33.124 --> 46:35.209
That wasn't there before.

46:35.292 --> 46:37.253
-You think Jude wrote that?
-I do.

46:37.336 --> 46:38.879
I saw him.

46:40.923 --> 46:42.717
And I think he's in trouble.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.684
-This isn't my house.
-That's what I was saying.

46:52.727 --> 46:54.395
-[crackling]
-[screams]

46:59.817 --> 47:01.318
What the hell?

47:04.989 --> 47:06.323
Is this a joke?

47:06.741 --> 47:09.827
We're somewhere else, June.
The same but different.

47:10.953 --> 47:12.371
That your sister?

47:12.705 --> 47:14.582
Yeah, but I've never seen
this picture before.

47:17.001 --> 47:18.502
Wait a sec.

47:29.722 --> 47:31.182
[whispering] June.

47:32.975 --> 47:34.727
[creaking]

48:12.098 --> 48:14.475

48:30.658 --> 48:31.826
Go away.

48:32.993 --> 48:34.286
[Jude yells]

48:34.787 --> 48:36.664
[gasping]

48:38.499 --> 48:39.917
[June] Molly, what are you doing?

48:40.918 --> 48:42.336
You should've let me smother you, June.

48:43.462 --> 48:44.630
It would've been easier.

48:45.631 --> 48:47.174
-Ready?
-Go.

48:51.428 --> 48:53.597
-That was your sister?
-We don't get along.

48:53.722 --> 48:54.765
No shit.

49:02.439 --> 49:04.358
-And here we go.
-Mmm-hmm.

49:06.193 --> 49:08.571
What is going on?

49:08.654 --> 49:12.032
-Hello, Mrs. Dragle.
-Just what the hell is going on?

49:12.283 --> 49:14.577
Well, ma'am, your son's probably inside
with a bunch of kids.

49:14.660 --> 49:16.954
It seems the party
got a bit out of control.

49:17.037 --> 49:19.707
-So go get them.
-Oh, we can't really.

49:20.541 --> 49:24.336
We don't have a warrant to go in so
we just have to wait till they come out.

49:24.420 --> 49:25.296
What?

49:25.379 --> 49:27.381
Oh, for Christ's sake,
why can't you go in?

49:27.464 --> 49:30.009
We don't have any evidence
of drug use or underage drinking

49:30.092 --> 49:32.428
and now it's pretty quiet in there, so...

49:32.803 --> 49:35.514
really, we just have to wait and make sure
nothing gets out of control again.

49:35.598 --> 49:37.474
[scoffs] Jesus.

49:38.309 --> 49:39.560
[Mrs. Dragle sighs]

49:44.190 --> 49:45.691
Eric!

49:47.401 --> 49:48.444
Open this door!

49:48.903 --> 49:49.987
Eric?

49:50.654 --> 49:53.115
-[pounding on door]
-Open this door.

49:54.116 --> 49:55.242
Eric?

49:56.493 --> 49:57.703
Eric!

49:58.746 --> 50:02.082
-Eric Dragle, open this door!
-Jesus!

50:02.625 --> 50:03.918
Oh, no.

50:04.293 --> 50:06.670
-Eric!
-[pounding resumes]

50:06.754 --> 50:08.756
Open the door, Eric!

50:09.340 --> 50:10.549
Oh, come on.

50:10.674 --> 50:12.343
[pounding continues]

50:12.426 --> 50:14.261
-Can't let her in.
-I'm dead.

50:14.345 --> 50:16.180
If you open the door, she comes in.

50:16.263 --> 50:19.058
Cop sticks his foot in the door,
then they come in. Things get worse.

50:20.184 --> 50:22.436
-How does this end?
-I think they'll leave.

50:23.479 --> 50:25.731
[pounding continues]

50:25.814 --> 50:27.149
[Mrs. Dragle] Eric!

50:27.233 --> 50:28.817
[pounding continues]

50:28.901 --> 50:31.445
Uh, hi, Mom.

50:32.029 --> 50:34.365
E-Everything's okay.
I'll see you at home.

50:34.448 --> 50:36.242
Fine, Eric. Fine.

50:36.867 --> 50:39.954
But I am now going to call
your father in the city.

50:40.663 --> 50:41.914
Eric!

50:47.253 --> 50:49.088
[all gasp]

50:49.171 --> 50:51.507
[indistinct chatter]

50:54.260 --> 50:58.305
And that is why we can't leave the house.

51:02.351 --> 51:03.852
Come with me.

51:08.816 --> 51:10.567
I went in there and I saw Jude.

51:10.651 --> 51:12.152
-[David] What?
-I know. I know.

51:12.236 --> 51:14.238
It sounds crazy,
but I swear to you I saw him.

51:15.447 --> 51:16.490
What do you mean though?

51:16.573 --> 51:19.910
I saw him and he was getting
the shit kicked out of him.

51:19.994 --> 51:21.287
David, come here.

51:24.248 --> 51:25.708
Was that there before?

51:26.834 --> 51:28.711
-I don't know.
-It wasn't.

51:28.794 --> 51:29.753
We all looked and it wasn't.

51:29.837 --> 51:31.505
-What is it?
-[Kent] It's writing.

51:31.588 --> 51:34.216
-It says, "Get me home."
-He thinks Jude wrote it.

51:34.550 --> 51:37.261
-Oh, my God.
-The closet was hidden, right?

51:37.344 --> 51:39.221
We all know there was never
any writing in there.

51:39.305 --> 51:42.141
And how come both of their cell phones
say that they're out of service?

51:42.224 --> 51:43.058
Kent.

51:43.142 --> 51:45.394
I think they're in trouble
and maybe they need our help.

51:45.853 --> 51:47.104
Look, she's gonna cry now.

51:47.187 --> 51:49.356
Why do you gotta be such
a goddamn asshole every time?

51:49.440 --> 51:51.317
[Nell] Stop! Stop it!

51:53.444 --> 51:55.112
Jesus, you guys.

52:08.542 --> 52:10.878
[both panting]

52:16.425 --> 52:17.968
Holy crap.

52:20.846 --> 52:22.639
It's like I said, the same but different.

52:24.475 --> 52:27.019
-Jesus.
-And here, Derek is dead.

52:27.478 --> 52:29.438
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

52:30.189 --> 52:32.191
That's what those guys were yelling
when they were chasing me.

52:32.274 --> 52:34.234
But I thought they were
just trying to scare me.

52:34.568 --> 52:36.195
-They're saying I killed him.
-Derek?

52:36.278 --> 52:37.946
In the park,
some kids said they saw me.

52:38.405 --> 52:39.239
Did you?

52:40.282 --> 52:41.116
June.

52:45.954 --> 52:48.165
-[continues panting, gasping]
-[Jude mumbles indistinctly]

52:51.210 --> 52:53.295
[cell phone rings]

52:58.258 --> 52:59.635
[ringing stops]

53:03.389 --> 53:05.015
My dad's back.

53:07.184 --> 53:08.268
From where?

53:09.395 --> 53:10.938
From being dead.

53:13.440 --> 53:16.527
-How did your dad die?
-[sighs]

53:17.152 --> 53:19.947
He hit a deer on the parkway.

53:22.408 --> 53:24.284
But wait, he's alive here.

53:25.035 --> 53:27.663
Maybe that's a good thing.
Maybe this place isn't all bad.

53:27.746 --> 53:31.834
It's all bad. It's a different my dad
and a different me too, I think.

53:31.917 --> 53:33.710
Wait. You saw another you?

53:34.294 --> 53:36.380
I saw my room and that was scary enough.

53:39.133 --> 53:41.093
-[tires squeal]
-It's Mr. Wallace.

53:41.593 --> 53:43.053
-[June] From school?
-[Jude] Yeah.

53:44.096 --> 53:45.722
[engine idling]

53:47.641 --> 53:49.726
He punched me and threw me in his car.

53:50.269 --> 53:52.521
Mr. Wallace punched you?
Our Mr. Wallace?

53:52.604 --> 53:54.523
He's surprisingly strong.

54:00.195 --> 54:02.364
-And he told me to get out of here.
-How?

54:02.448 --> 54:04.450
He said the closet, but I tried.

54:04.533 --> 54:06.326
-Wait. You went back?
-Yeah.

54:07.619 --> 54:08.745
Maybe if both of us...

54:09.955 --> 54:12.708
[Jude] The place is gonna
be packed with cops.

54:14.877 --> 54:16.170
[cell phone ringing]

54:17.838 --> 54:19.339
[ringing continues]

54:21.467 --> 54:22.843
[ringing stops]

54:22.926 --> 54:24.428
[sighs]

54:29.892 --> 54:32.060
-[cries out]
-Stay in there, Jude.

54:32.269 --> 54:35.063
What has he told you?
What has he told you?

54:35.147 --> 54:36.982
That we have to get out.

54:37.065 --> 54:39.818
Good. Yes. How?

54:41.862 --> 54:43.614
We have to go back to the closet.

54:43.697 --> 54:45.782
And so, Jude...

54:46.867 --> 54:48.869
Please don't hit me, Mr. Wallace.

54:52.831 --> 54:55.876
-And why the hell are you here?
-I tried.

54:55.959 --> 54:58.462
-You tried what?
-The closet. It didn't work.

54:58.587 --> 54:59.505
Just you?

55:01.131 --> 55:01.965
Yeah

55:02.049 --> 55:06.053
So, and I know that you are
the little genius in the group,

55:06.220 --> 55:09.056
maybe try both of you.

55:09.139 --> 55:11.767
Mr. Wallace, sir.
Uh, they found me.

55:11.850 --> 55:15.938
So the house is gonna be packed
with cops and more people.

55:16.104 --> 55:17.523
[sighs]

55:18.982 --> 55:20.317
Get in the car.

55:22.027 --> 55:24.488
Get in. Lie down in the back.

55:36.083 --> 55:37.543
Jesus Christ.

55:48.262 --> 55:49.846
I'll let you touch me if you want.

55:55.352 --> 55:57.437
-[Derek] Garage?
-[David] Empty.

55:58.438 --> 56:01.191
-Basement?
-We searched everywhere, Derek.

56:01.275 --> 56:03.277
How do you know?
You didn't even know that was here.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.278
Shut up.

56:17.291 --> 56:19.209
-It's just a closet, you guys.
-[Kent] It isn't.

56:19.501 --> 56:23.338
That was honestly the most boring
seven minutes of my life, assholes.

56:24.548 --> 56:27.426
I swear to God, I saw him.
I know he's still here.

56:27.593 --> 56:30.137
-Okay, then how do we help him?
-I don't know.

56:30.220 --> 56:31.430
I don't think we should leave.

56:31.930 --> 56:33.599
What if they're, like,
at a movie or something?

56:33.682 --> 56:35.225
[Kent] They're not at a movie.

56:35.934 --> 56:39.646
[woman] Kendall! Kendall Brenner!
Come to the window now!

56:39.771 --> 56:41.064
God.

56:42.899 --> 56:44.151
That's Kendall's mom, Kent.

56:45.027 --> 56:46.945
-He told you?
-Oh, yeah.

56:48.614 --> 56:49.656
[sighs]

56:55.829 --> 56:57.414
Where is he taking us?

56:57.748 --> 56:59.875
I... I think to the house.

57:00.959 --> 57:03.795
Mr. Wallace, if we go to the house,
I think I'll be arrested.

57:03.879 --> 57:05.255
Stop talking.

57:17.059 --> 57:18.769
[indistinct police radio chatter]

57:23.106 --> 57:24.483
Stay there.

57:33.867 --> 57:35.494
[inaudible]

57:36.244 --> 57:37.579
[June] What's he doing?

57:37.746 --> 57:39.414
Maybe he's in charge of this place.

57:47.923 --> 57:48.799
Let's go.

57:50.092 --> 57:51.301
Come on.

58:12.197 --> 58:14.533
-[Jude] Uh...
-Come on.

58:27.170 --> 58:28.964
You have seven minutes.

58:29.423 --> 58:31.550
Hopefully, I'll never see you again,
but if I do...

58:33.510 --> 58:35.262
there's nothing I can do for you.

58:40.851 --> 58:41.810
[June] Come on, Jude.

58:52.279 --> 58:54.531
[woman] Kendall, open the door now.

58:56.575 --> 58:59.995
[scoffs] All right, fine.

59:01.538 --> 59:04.499
You see these, hmm? You see them?

59:04.958 --> 59:06.334
Take a good look.

59:06.835 --> 59:09.087
'Cause if you don't
get your butt out here right now,

59:09.337 --> 59:11.256
it's gonna be the last time
that you see them.

59:11.882 --> 59:13.925
Maybe until you're married, Kendall!

59:14.259 --> 59:15.886
Her mom seems mean.

59:16.386 --> 59:18.305
Why would you make out with her?

59:18.680 --> 59:19.765
Shut up, Nell.

59:22.100 --> 59:24.019
[cell phone clicks]

59:25.812 --> 59:27.564
-Seven minutes.
-Yeah.

59:31.234 --> 59:32.694
Are you okay?

59:35.072 --> 59:37.574
I don't know. Yeah... I guess.

59:38.825 --> 59:40.243
[Jude sighs]

1:00:50.021 --> 1:00:50.939
Kent.

1:00:51.815 --> 1:00:53.316
You better come down here.

1:01:04.953 --> 1:01:06.371
Hi, Mrs. Sullivan.

1:01:06.454 --> 1:01:07.664
[Megan] Where's Jude?

1:01:07.956 --> 1:01:09.583
I don't know. Is he not at home?

1:01:10.625 --> 1:01:12.252
Would I be here if he was?

1:01:13.378 --> 1:01:14.713
Try June's house.

1:01:15.046 --> 1:01:17.215
[Megan] Hi, Nell. Who's June?

1:01:17.299 --> 1:01:19.634
June Johnson. They left together.

1:01:19.718 --> 1:01:20.802
To where?

1:01:21.386 --> 1:01:23.346
I don't know.

1:01:23.430 --> 1:01:26.933
We, uh... we didn't see them leave,
so they might still be here.

1:01:28.101 --> 1:01:29.269
Why isn't his phone working?

1:01:30.687 --> 1:01:33.398
That's a very good question,
Mrs. Sullivan.

1:01:34.691 --> 1:01:36.651
-Kent.
-It's Luke.

1:01:36.818 --> 1:01:38.612
-What?
-He's Luke.

1:01:38.695 --> 1:01:40.197
-[chuckles]
-[Megan] He's Kent.

1:01:40.280 --> 1:01:42.532
Yeah. No, it's Kent. Yeah, Mrs. Sullivan.

1:01:42.908 --> 1:01:45.410
Where the hell am I supposed
to look for my son?

1:02:00.467 --> 1:02:02.427
We still have four minutes.

1:02:09.643 --> 1:02:11.144
Can I ask you a question?

1:02:11.478 --> 1:02:14.981
Yes, it was my first time.
Did I not do it right?

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:16.650
You did fine.

1:02:18.944 --> 1:02:21.238
Was it your first time?

1:02:23.198 --> 1:02:24.199
No.

1:02:29.621 --> 1:02:32.249
What happens if we open the door
and we're still here?

1:02:32.707 --> 1:02:38.588
We quickly forget about how maybe
I didn't do so good, and we run fast.

1:02:38.672 --> 1:02:40.548
You did fine.

1:02:42.592 --> 1:02:44.511
Jesus, why do you still have that?

1:02:46.471 --> 1:02:47.514
It's my mom.

1:02:48.098 --> 1:02:49.307
Really?

1:02:50.350 --> 1:02:52.602
Wow. Looks like
it was taken forever ago.

1:02:52.686 --> 1:02:54.145
Yeah, but it's her.

1:02:54.229 --> 1:02:56.189
And I think it's how we got here.

1:02:56.648 --> 1:02:57.732
How?

1:02:57.816 --> 1:03:00.777
I don't know. The same but not the same.

1:03:00.860 --> 1:03:03.113
But this was where we were.

1:03:04.114 --> 1:03:05.657
And I don't have one.

1:03:06.491 --> 1:03:07.993
I don't think it's that.

1:03:08.076 --> 1:03:11.121
Well, something did it.

1:03:12.038 --> 1:03:13.456
Yeah.

1:03:14.958 --> 1:03:16.459
I don't know.

1:03:36.479 --> 1:03:37.814
You ready?

1:03:39.316 --> 1:03:40.275
I guess.

1:04:24.069 --> 1:04:25.362
Let's get out of here.

1:04:30.158 --> 1:04:32.410
[thunder rumbling]

1:04:36.539 --> 1:04:37.832
[June] Where is everybody?

1:04:38.958 --> 1:04:40.293
[Jude] I don't know.

1:04:40.835 --> 1:04:42.504
[cell phone ringing]

1:04:46.383 --> 1:04:48.426
-Hi, Mom.
-[Megan]<i> Are you okay?</i>

1:04:49.594 --> 1:04:51.388
-Yeah.
<i>-Are you headed home?</i>

1:04:51.638 --> 1:04:55.016
<i>I went by to pick you up</i>
<i>and everybody was gone. I got worried.</i>

1:04:55.350 --> 1:04:59.187
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
Sorry, but, Mom, where is everybody?

1:04:59.270 --> 1:05:00.647
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1:05:00.730 --> 1:05:04.484
I mean it just seems
like nobody's around.

1:05:04.776 --> 1:05:07.112
<i>It's late, Jude. Just come home.</i>

1:05:07.195 --> 1:05:08.279
Okay.

1:05:08.571 --> 1:05:09.864
<i>-Jude.</i>
-Yeah?

1:05:09.948 --> 1:05:11.658
<i>Come straight home, okay?</i>

1:05:12.742 --> 1:05:14.119
Okay.

1:05:14.202 --> 1:05:16.329
-What did she say?
-That it's late.

1:05:16.413 --> 1:05:18.581
But it was definitely my mom.

1:05:18.665 --> 1:05:21.543
-And everything sounded okay.
-Oh, thank God.

1:05:23.545 --> 1:05:24.754
[engine idling]

1:05:24.838 --> 1:05:27.590
-It's Wallace.
-Should we run?

1:05:30.802 --> 1:05:32.846
-Yes!
-[tires screeching]

1:05:49.696 --> 1:05:52.198
[car rattling]

1:05:52.282 --> 1:05:53.158
[car squeals]

1:05:56.244 --> 1:05:57.829
[both panting]

1:05:59.122 --> 1:06:01.833
If Mr. Wallace is after us,
where are we now?

1:06:01.916 --> 1:06:02.917
I don't know.

1:06:03.084 --> 1:06:04.586
[tires screeching]

1:06:06.629 --> 1:06:08.256
-Oh, Jesus!
-Come on!

1:06:31.613 --> 1:06:33.865
-[Jude] He stopped.
-[engine idling]

1:06:39.746 --> 1:06:41.080
What street is this?

1:06:41.164 --> 1:06:44.083
[Jude] I don't know.
We passed Gaylord. I remember that.

1:06:44.167 --> 1:06:45.543
This all looks wrong, though.

1:06:46.211 --> 1:06:48.630
-Where the hell is Prosserdale?
-I have no idea.

1:06:48.713 --> 1:06:50.173
[Jude] Yeah, well, we're on it.

1:06:50.298 --> 1:06:52.592
[cell phone ringing]

1:06:54.302 --> 1:06:56.721
-Nell?
<i>-Hey, my dad's back. Where are you?</i>

1:06:56.804 --> 1:06:58.473
Uh, I'm not sure.

1:06:58.765 --> 1:07:00.934
Well, come to Kent's. Everybody's here.

1:07:02.602 --> 1:07:06.189
-Everybody like who?
<i>-What do you mean? Everybody.</i>

1:07:06.564 --> 1:07:09.692
-Is Derek there?
<i>-Yeah, but he's being okay. Just come.</i>

1:07:09.776 --> 1:07:13.780
[chuckles] Uh...
I'm not sure where we are now.

1:07:14.989 --> 1:07:16.199
Who's we?

1:07:17.242 --> 1:07:19.369
Um, I'm with June.

1:07:19.994 --> 1:07:22.247
<i>Yeah, that's what everybody said.</i>

1:07:22.455 --> 1:07:23.957
We just got lost.

1:07:24.499 --> 1:07:27.961
<i>-Where are you?</i>
-Uh, some street called Prosserdale.

1:07:28.044 --> 1:07:30.171
That's right here. That goes to Kent's.

1:07:30.255 --> 1:07:31.256
[Jude] <i>What?</i>

1:07:31.756 --> 1:07:32.924
Just stay on that road.

1:07:33.925 --> 1:07:35.385
Okay.

1:07:36.803 --> 1:07:39.639
I guess we're close to Kent's.

1:07:40.890 --> 1:07:42.433
-Really?
-She says.

1:07:49.482 --> 1:07:50.692
-Careful!
-What?

1:07:50.775 --> 1:07:52.277
There's a dog.

1:07:55.738 --> 1:07:57.115
There was a dog.

1:08:26.561 --> 1:08:27.854
[knocks on door]

1:08:55.298 --> 1:08:56.633
Hello?

1:09:00.094 --> 1:09:01.137
Kent?

1:09:07.894 --> 1:09:09.896
[people chattering]

1:09:11.481 --> 1:09:12.482
No.

1:09:12.565 --> 1:09:14.442
Yeah, no.

1:09:14.525 --> 1:09:15.777
Oh, yes.

1:09:16.569 --> 1:09:17.737
Hi, June.

1:09:18.780 --> 1:09:20.031
Hi.

1:09:20.365 --> 1:09:22.408
So this shithead kills me
and then you start boning him?

1:09:22.492 --> 1:09:23.368
Shut up!

1:09:23.493 --> 1:09:26.371
And I didn't kill you.
You're standing right here.

1:09:26.454 --> 1:09:28.581
-Dude.
-Jesus.

1:09:28.665 --> 1:09:29.999
I still have the pencil.

1:09:30.291 --> 1:09:31.584
Why did you do this, Jude?

1:09:31.834 --> 1:09:32.669
I didn't.

1:09:32.835 --> 1:09:35.088
And why would you pick her over me?

1:09:37.799 --> 1:09:39.425
He didn't touch me, Bell.

1:09:39.717 --> 1:09:40.885
[buzzer blares]

1:09:41.010 --> 1:09:42.428
[people cheer and applaud]

1:09:42.970 --> 1:09:45.473
That is a great answer, June. Well done.

1:09:45.932 --> 1:09:47.392
We're gonna play another game.

1:09:47.475 --> 1:09:49.310
Seven in Heaven was clearly
a blast for you two,

1:09:49.394 --> 1:09:51.187
but this one, I think you'll love.

1:09:51.979 --> 1:09:54.941
Really. We've been waiting
for this for a long time.

1:09:55.024 --> 1:09:57.652
It's like truth or dare, but more fun.

1:09:59.112 --> 1:10:00.363
Let go.

1:10:01.698 --> 1:10:04.283
-I didn't--
-Don't say anything, Jude.

1:10:04.367 --> 1:10:05.201
Not yet.

1:10:20.341 --> 1:10:21.926
[Derek] You looking for mommy, Judie?

1:10:22.135 --> 1:10:26.097
You know, it's not truth or dare, really.
It's more like lie and die.

1:10:26.347 --> 1:10:29.142
We ask you a question
and if you lie, bing!

1:10:29.350 --> 1:10:32.228
The magic door opens up and
grabs someone you care about.

1:10:32.311 --> 1:10:35.189
And then you get
one more chance to tell the truth.

1:10:35.356 --> 1:10:36.566
-What?
-What the hell

1:10:36.649 --> 1:10:37.859
are you talking about, Derek?

1:10:38.609 --> 1:10:39.694
You'll see.

1:10:43.614 --> 1:10:45.908
[cheers and applause]

1:10:52.206 --> 1:10:53.458
What the hell?

1:10:53.541 --> 1:10:58.212
So, when you said that little thing about
how Judie didn't touch you,

1:10:58.504 --> 1:10:59.505
that was a lie.

1:10:59.839 --> 1:11:01.048
And now here's your sister.

1:11:02.633 --> 1:11:04.552
So come on down!

1:11:04.969 --> 1:11:06.763
[cheering]

1:11:18.065 --> 1:11:21.903
Now you get to play one more time.
Are you ready for your question?

1:11:21.986 --> 1:11:25.490
-I wasn't playing in the first place.
-Oh, yes, you were!

1:11:28.034 --> 1:11:29.952
June, question.

1:11:30.661 --> 1:11:33.498
-What?
-It's an easy one. Trust me.

1:11:33.581 --> 1:11:34.916
What, Derek?

1:11:34.999 --> 1:11:36.626
Your sister's away at school.

1:11:37.877 --> 1:11:38.961
Do you miss her?

1:11:41.756 --> 1:11:42.715
Of course.

1:11:43.382 --> 1:11:44.550
[buzzer blares]

1:11:45.218 --> 1:11:46.385
[muffled screaming]

1:11:46.469 --> 1:11:47.512
[cackling]

1:11:58.523 --> 1:12:00.149
[cheering continues]

1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:17.875
-Yeah! Whoo!
-Yeah!

1:12:23.965 --> 1:12:25.550
[screaming]

1:12:25.716 --> 1:12:27.552
Look at me. It's not real!

1:12:27.844 --> 1:12:29.303
[Derek] You lied to us, June.

1:12:29.512 --> 1:12:31.305
You lied to me and you lied to them.

1:12:31.514 --> 1:12:33.975
If you hadn't, your sister
would still be fast asleep.

1:12:36.477 --> 1:12:37.895
And she would've woken up.

1:12:40.731 --> 1:12:43.776
Now, Judie, it's your turn.

1:12:43.860 --> 1:12:46.904
And again, I do think this is an easy one.
We want to start off slow.

1:12:47.446 --> 1:12:49.532
But we have a special guest for this one.

1:12:49.699 --> 1:12:51.742
[applause]

1:12:57.331 --> 1:12:58.708
[sing-song] Hey, Jude.

1:13:00.710 --> 1:13:06.716
So that marbles thing that you were so
very smart about, what is it called again?

1:13:08.467 --> 1:13:11.220
-Benford's Law.
-Yes, that's it.

1:13:11.304 --> 1:13:13.222
I'll certainly never forget it.

1:13:13.973 --> 1:13:15.766
But that wasn't the question.

1:13:17.852 --> 1:13:19.061
Do you love Penelope?

1:13:20.229 --> 1:13:23.816
Or Nell, as I guess you call her.

1:13:26.611 --> 1:13:28.070
It's okay.

1:13:30.406 --> 1:13:31.324
I don't know.

1:13:31.866 --> 1:13:33.284
[buzzer blares]

1:13:34.327 --> 1:13:36.746
-[audience cheers]
-[Derek] Well, it seems you do know.

1:13:42.126 --> 1:13:45.171
Hey, Jude. Is your dad alive?

1:13:49.842 --> 1:13:51.260
No.

1:13:52.303 --> 1:13:54.388
Wait, what? Are you sure?

1:13:55.514 --> 1:13:57.683
-I thought maybe you saw him.
-He's dead.

1:13:57.767 --> 1:13:59.226
And how did he die?

1:14:01.187 --> 1:14:02.897
In a car accident.

1:14:09.445 --> 1:14:11.197
[cheering]

1:14:13.991 --> 1:14:15.618
[laughing]

1:14:17.036 --> 1:14:19.038
[cheering continues]

1:14:30.633 --> 1:14:32.677
Let's see if this thing works backwards.

1:14:33.010 --> 1:14:36.681
Judie, that was a tricky one.
You told the truth and he still died.

1:14:37.056 --> 1:14:38.349
Kent.

1:14:39.558 --> 1:14:41.143
You're a weird-ass kid, Judie.

1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:43.854
Did you wet the bed until sixth grade?

1:14:48.943 --> 1:14:50.653
-No.
-[buzzer blares]

1:14:52.279 --> 1:14:53.489
No!

1:15:05.042 --> 1:15:06.669
[Derek] This is not how this is played.

1:15:06.961 --> 1:15:09.672
A game's a game, Derek.
Ready for your next question, Kent?

1:15:09.922 --> 1:15:11.382
-Oh, shit.
-Please.

1:15:16.262 --> 1:15:17.680
Oh.

1:15:18.180 --> 1:15:19.306
Hi, Mrs. Brenner.

1:15:21.976 --> 1:15:24.353
Please, don't ask anything.

1:15:25.271 --> 1:15:27.231
-You go.
-Derek.

1:15:28.691 --> 1:15:30.317
Why did we never have sex?

1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:32.194
What?

1:15:34.030 --> 1:15:35.448
Why?

1:15:38.409 --> 1:15:39.618
Because we didn't.

1:15:40.036 --> 1:15:41.579
[buzzer blares]

1:15:41.746 --> 1:15:43.289
-[crowd murmuring]
-No.

1:15:43.372 --> 1:15:46.584
No, because you finished
as soon as I took your belt off.

1:15:49.211 --> 1:15:50.463
Ready for the next one?

1:15:50.546 --> 1:15:54.341
Derek, don't say another word.

1:15:56.761 --> 1:15:58.804
[all clamoring]

1:16:14.612 --> 1:16:16.322
[Jude] Go, go!

1:16:18.074 --> 1:16:19.366
[all clamoring]

1:16:30.169 --> 1:16:31.921
-In here.
-Wait!

1:16:32.254 --> 1:16:33.589
Wait, Jude!

1:16:36.217 --> 1:16:37.176
Jude.

1:16:37.718 --> 1:16:39.720
-Dad.
-You have to get out of here, Jude.

1:16:39.804 --> 1:16:42.473
-I know, we're trying.
-Not really.

1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:44.892
-What?
-You're just going around and around.

1:16:44.975 --> 1:16:46.602
But I don't know how to--

1:16:46.685 --> 1:16:50.731
Yes, you do.
If you wanted to end it, you'd end it.

1:16:50.815 --> 1:16:52.274
Come on, Jude! Let me in!

1:16:53.901 --> 1:16:55.402
[clamoring]

1:16:55.569 --> 1:16:57.238
Jude, come on. Please, please!

1:16:58.197 --> 1:16:59.198
I like her, by the way.

1:16:59.281 --> 1:17:01.408
Yeah. I do too, but how do I end it?

1:17:01.492 --> 1:17:03.035
Just like our chess games.

1:17:03.119 --> 1:17:06.705
You have to reset the clocks,
get everything back to zero. End the game.

1:17:09.792 --> 1:17:11.544
End the game.

1:17:12.419 --> 1:17:14.380
If I end it, you won't be here?

1:17:16.006 --> 1:17:18.008
Right. And neither will you.

1:17:18.467 --> 1:17:21.428
Please, Jude! Jude, please!

1:17:26.142 --> 1:17:27.476
Jude!

1:17:27.560 --> 1:17:29.854
Let me in! Come on!

1:17:31.939 --> 1:17:34.275
-You have to hurry.
-Dad, what is this?

1:17:34.733 --> 1:17:36.735
Hold onto it till you get home.

1:17:37.153 --> 1:17:38.112
Ask your mom.

1:17:41.907 --> 1:17:42.992
Bye, Dad.

1:17:43.993 --> 1:17:45.786
Run, Jude. Run.

1:17:46.328 --> 1:17:49.540
-Jude! What the hell?
-Run!

1:18:05.472 --> 1:18:06.307
Shit!

1:18:13.522 --> 1:18:14.648
[gasping]

1:18:28.996 --> 1:18:30.331
[Derek] Hey! Judie!

1:18:30.497 --> 1:18:32.875
[Jude] Shit! Quick. Grab the chain.

1:18:34.293 --> 1:18:35.377
Shit!

1:18:36.712 --> 1:18:38.088
Keep it closed!

1:18:41.008 --> 1:18:42.676
[Derek] Judie!

1:18:43.594 --> 1:18:45.262
Open the door, Judie!

1:18:52.603 --> 1:18:54.605
I told you, Jude.

1:18:54.688 --> 1:18:58.984
If you didn't make it out,
there's nothing I could do for you.

1:19:01.237 --> 1:19:05.366
You also once told me it was your job
to get me out into the real world.

1:19:06.242 --> 1:19:08.994
-[door pounding]
-This isn't the real world, Mr. Wallace.

1:19:13.874 --> 1:19:15.084
For you it is now.

1:19:15.167 --> 1:19:18.295
No, it isn't. I can get us out.
Take us back to the house.

1:19:19.838 --> 1:19:22.091
[pounding on door continues]

1:19:25.427 --> 1:19:26.512
Then we'd better run.

1:19:34.687 --> 1:19:35.813
[Derek grunts]

1:19:35.896 --> 1:19:37.398
Judie!

1:19:37.856 --> 1:19:38.983
[engine revs]

1:20:11.140 --> 1:20:12.391
[Jude] Cutting through the park.

1:20:12.474 --> 1:20:13.767
[June] How do they know where we're going?

1:20:13.851 --> 1:20:15.769
[Mr. Wallace] They know and they don't
want you to make it.

1:20:15.978 --> 1:20:18.105
-[Jude] Why?
-They want you to stay here.

1:20:18.188 --> 1:20:20.024
They want to hurt you
for as long as they can.

1:20:20.190 --> 1:20:22.860
-Why?
-'Cause they can. Because you let them.

1:20:22.943 --> 1:20:26.655
This is the place where the worst thoughts
take over. Everybody's worst thoughts.

1:20:26.739 --> 1:20:28.699
And you sure as hell turned
everything upside down.

1:20:29.616 --> 1:20:31.618
-We need seven minutes.
-I know.

1:20:31.702 --> 1:20:33.871
-Will we have seven minutes?
-Probably not.

1:20:33.954 --> 1:20:35.581
You said you had a plan.

1:20:35.748 --> 1:20:37.750
We're gonna die if we stay here.

1:20:37.833 --> 1:20:40.419
But I know how to get us
seven minutes, I think.

1:20:40.502 --> 1:20:44.131
-How do we do it?
-The same way we beat their game.

1:20:44.381 --> 1:20:47.259
We have to take it over.
We need to control it and end it.

1:20:47.593 --> 1:20:48.427
How?

1:20:48.510 --> 1:20:51.680
We have to destroy the closet.
We need to reset the clocks.

1:20:51.764 --> 1:20:54.767
What? I thought you said
it was the card or something.

1:20:54.850 --> 1:20:58.937
Maybe the card's important, but my dad
said to hold onto it till we get home.

1:20:59.688 --> 1:21:01.231
Like a... like a passport.

1:21:01.565 --> 1:21:02.399
What?

1:21:02.483 --> 1:21:04.485
It's only important when
you're away from home, but--

1:21:04.568 --> 1:21:06.695
But you still need it to get home.

1:21:06.779 --> 1:21:09.865
But how are we gonna tear down the closet
and use it at the same time?

1:21:09.948 --> 1:21:12.618
The gas can that you smashed my head on,
does it have gas in it?

1:21:12.910 --> 1:21:13.827
Of course.

1:21:15.079 --> 1:21:17.039
We tear it down as we go through.

1:21:17.247 --> 1:21:19.249
What if some of the others
have gone through?

1:21:20.376 --> 1:21:23.253
I... I'm sure they've tried, but I don't
think the closet would let them.

1:21:23.545 --> 1:21:25.923
-Why not?
-No passport.

1:21:30.677 --> 1:21:31.762
[David] Oh, shit!

1:21:31.929 --> 1:21:33.972
-Who is that?
-My grandmother.

1:21:34.181 --> 1:21:36.600
-So? Okay.
-She has a key.

1:21:37.226 --> 1:21:38.352
Oh, this is bad.

1:21:39.395 --> 1:21:41.522
[indistinct chatter]

1:21:57.037 --> 1:21:58.038
Have at them.

1:22:09.383 --> 1:22:10.843
Thank you, Mr. Wallace.

1:22:12.177 --> 1:22:14.263
-June!
-Go, go, go.

1:22:14.346 --> 1:22:16.056
No matter what,
give it the full seven minutes.

1:22:16.140 --> 1:22:16.974
June!

1:22:17.057 --> 1:22:18.851
-I don't like this idea.
-It'll work.

1:22:18.934 --> 1:22:21.061
-How do you know?
-I promise it will. Please.

1:22:22.938 --> 1:22:24.898
They're going to kill us. Please, come on!

1:22:27.067 --> 1:22:28.485
Please!

1:22:31.196 --> 1:22:32.698
Come on. I can't do it without you.

1:22:47.421 --> 1:22:49.548
-[fizzles]
-You're kidding me.

1:23:02.811 --> 1:23:04.146
Jesus.

1:23:05.230 --> 1:23:07.524
-It'll work.
-How do you know?

1:23:09.526 --> 1:23:12.738
[Jude] Wallace said this is the world
where our worst thoughts take over.

1:23:12.821 --> 1:23:14.031
So?

1:23:14.114 --> 1:23:16.408
We never made them answer
the second question.

1:23:16.492 --> 1:23:18.285
What? We could've hurt them.

1:23:18.368 --> 1:23:21.038
We could've killed Kent's mom
or Derek's dad and we didn't.

1:23:21.121 --> 1:23:23.874
And like Wallace said,
it turned everything upside down.

1:23:24.082 --> 1:23:27.169
If we won't kill them,
this world can't use us anymore.

1:23:28.045 --> 1:23:31.131
-You really believe that?
-I think I do. Yeah.

1:23:36.303 --> 1:23:39.556
[Officer Meade] All right, let's all play
hands on our heads, butts on the floor.

1:23:39.640 --> 1:23:41.016
Now!

1:23:44.144 --> 1:23:47.523
-Where's Derek?
-I don't know. I thought he was down here.

1:23:47.814 --> 1:23:51.193
At least I don't have to pretend
to be Derek's girlfriend anymore.

1:23:52.778 --> 1:23:54.905
Yeah, but I wasn't
pretending with you now.

1:23:57.741 --> 1:24:00.202
-Are we going to jail?
-What's your name?

1:24:00.786 --> 1:24:02.371
Thomas Phares.

1:24:02.996 --> 1:24:06.458
Well, we'll just see,
Thomas Phares, won't we?

1:24:12.047 --> 1:24:13.090
-Shit!
-What?

1:24:13.173 --> 1:24:14.675
The hinges burned my back.

1:24:22.349 --> 1:24:24.309
Your sister is fine, I promise you.

1:24:29.106 --> 1:24:30.232
Just four more minutes.

1:24:31.400 --> 1:24:33.026
-[crashing]
-[gasping]

1:24:34.820 --> 1:24:36.863
[both coughing]

1:24:47.666 --> 1:24:49.668
[coughing continues]

1:24:51.545 --> 1:24:53.589
-This isn't gonna work.
-It will.

1:24:54.172 --> 1:24:55.632
[sobbing] We're gonna die in here.

1:25:00.596 --> 1:25:01.847
[Jude screams]

1:25:01.930 --> 1:25:03.015
[June shrieks]

1:25:04.766 --> 1:25:07.227
Remember first grade?
This is gonna be like that.

1:25:07.644 --> 1:25:09.855
We're gonna go outside
and I'm gonna start calling off the names

1:25:09.938 --> 1:25:12.065
of everyone whose parents are outside
waiting for them,

1:25:12.149 --> 1:25:13.150
then you will be released.

1:25:13.525 --> 1:25:16.153
For those of you whose parents clearly
don't give a damn about you,

1:25:16.236 --> 1:25:18.155
we will have a van come
and take you to the station.

1:25:18.238 --> 1:25:20.073
They can meet you there, okay?

1:25:20.365 --> 1:25:25.287
Okay. Good. Can I get Lisa Burke
and Chuck Mallet, please? On me, let's go.

1:25:25.912 --> 1:25:29.458
Then I'm gonna need an Ashley O'Neil,
Megan Collins, Stephanie Kelley,

1:25:29.541 --> 1:25:31.460
Matt Thompson, Scott Worth.

1:25:32.294 --> 1:25:34.546
Excuse me. Is Jude Sullivan in there?

1:25:34.921 --> 1:25:36.590
Sullivan?

1:25:38.592 --> 1:25:39.635
Uh, no. Haven't got him.

1:25:40.177 --> 1:25:41.261
June Johnson?

1:25:41.762 --> 1:25:43.180
Johnson.

1:25:43.805 --> 1:25:44.681
Nope.

1:25:44.765 --> 1:25:46.058
I think our kids are missing.

1:25:46.350 --> 1:25:48.810
Their phones don't work.
Someone here said they left.

1:25:48.894 --> 1:25:49.895
Disappeared.

1:25:50.437 --> 1:25:52.314
Disappeared is, I guess, what they said.

1:27:10.308 --> 1:27:13.103
Everybody just stay there
for a second, okay?

1:27:13.854 --> 1:27:16.189
-Jude.
-Mom, just for a second.

1:27:27.784 --> 1:27:28.785
I didn't kill Derek.

1:27:31.204 --> 1:27:32.873
Okay, that's... that's good.

1:27:34.040 --> 1:27:38.462
Jude, nice to see you. You too, June.

1:27:44.718 --> 1:27:47.596
Kent, are we friends?

1:27:48.680 --> 1:27:50.515
Of course we're friends, man.

1:27:54.978 --> 1:27:56.021
Where you been?

1:27:57.731 --> 1:27:59.983
I'm not sure, I guess.

1:28:05.572 --> 1:28:06.573
Hey.

1:28:06.656 --> 1:28:08.450
Where did you guys go?

1:28:09.534 --> 1:28:11.661
[sighs] It's really confusing now.

1:28:11.745 --> 1:28:14.456
Okay, I'm gonna go back up there
and I'm gonna look for Derek.

1:28:28.303 --> 1:28:29.679
Where the hell were you, huh?

1:28:29.763 --> 1:28:31.223
We searched the house, top to bottom.

1:28:42.692 --> 1:28:44.361
[sniffing]

1:28:46.071 --> 1:28:47.531
Did you guys go to a campfire?

1:28:51.159 --> 1:28:52.744
[chuckles]

1:28:53.537 --> 1:28:54.663
Hey, Mom.

1:28:55.539 --> 1:28:57.415
[chuckles]

1:29:05.006 --> 1:29:06.132
What's this?

1:29:07.092 --> 1:29:09.261
[chuckling]

1:29:09.553 --> 1:29:11.596
A few of us made these years ago.

1:29:12.222 --> 1:29:15.016
When we first moved here.
It was sort of a joke gift.

1:29:16.059 --> 1:29:18.895
We made them and
we put them in the pack

1:29:19.521 --> 1:29:20.981
and we gave them to the husbands.

1:29:22.107 --> 1:29:23.525
What did dad do when he saw it?

1:29:24.109 --> 1:29:25.569
He played along.

1:29:26.111 --> 1:29:29.698
I think he liked seeing
some silly different version of me.

1:29:29.781 --> 1:29:30.615
Oh.

1:29:31.658 --> 1:29:32.784
You okay?

1:29:34.202 --> 1:29:35.412
Yeah.

1:29:37.163 --> 1:29:39.916
Wow, that was forever ago.

1:30:08.153 --> 1:30:09.904
[breathing heavily]
