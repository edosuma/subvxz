WEBVTT

01:06.588 --> 01:07.980
Today's the day. - All right.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.417
I feel good about this one.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.332
Us three witches are fire.

01:11.506 --> 01:12.898
I don't know why we keep trying
without a fourth.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.161
Oh, here she goes.

01:14.335 --> 01:15.858
What? It's been two years.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.555
Maybe we don't need a fourth.

01:17.729 --> 01:18.904
Yeah, you need all four.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.732
Each crescent moon
is an element.

01:20.906 --> 01:22.212
See? North, south,
east, west.

01:22.386 --> 01:23.996
I wanna freeze time.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.781
We couldn't freeze time
if we had a fourth.

01:25.955 --> 01:27.087
I have it on the table,
Frankie.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.523
You need to hold it,
or else

01:28.697 --> 01:29.915
you're gonna light
something on fire.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.352
All right, ladies.

01:31.526 --> 01:32.744
I love this plate.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.094
Don't put it out.

01:34.268 --> 01:35.791
I have to.
We have to do the ritual.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.184
Your feather.

01:37.358 --> 01:38.750
Frankie, watch out.

01:38.924 --> 01:41.101
You're always lighting
things on fire, bro.

01:41.275 --> 01:43.581
Not this time. - Y'all witches ready?

01:53.635 --> 01:56.116
As the night receives
Your light

01:56.290 --> 01:58.553
And the oceans feel your pull

01:58.727 --> 02:01.121
I set my intention
To grow with you

02:01.295 --> 02:02.731
From new to full

02:02.905 --> 02:04.863
I summon the spirits
of the North,

02:05.037 --> 02:07.039
spirit of earth and body,

02:07.214 --> 02:09.129
spirit of dirt.

02:09.303 --> 02:10.391
Blessed be.

02:10.565 --> 02:12.915
I summon the spirits
of the East,

02:13.089 --> 02:17.615
spirit of air, spirit of new
beginnings, spirit of breath.

02:17.789 --> 02:19.182
Blessed be.

02:19.356 --> 02:21.619
I summon the spirits
of the South,

02:21.793 --> 02:24.405
spirit of fire and will,
spirit of heat.

02:24.579 --> 02:25.797
Blessed be.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.682
Tabby,
can you just pretend

02:40.856 --> 02:42.553
you didn't summon
the Southern spirits

02:42.727 --> 02:44.164
and do the spirits
of the West?

02:44.338 --> 02:46.209
What? No. That's whack.
I already did mine.

02:46.383 --> 02:48.559
Someone needs to.
It's not gonna work otherwise.

02:48.733 --> 02:49.865
If we're gonna be honest,

02:50.039 --> 02:51.475
the spirits of the West
have been

02:51.649 --> 02:53.085
messin' shit up
for a while now,

02:53.260 --> 02:54.826
so why don't we just
leave 'em out.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.263
She's got
a valid point.

02:56.437 --> 02:58.569
And, look, anyways,
it starts with East.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.136
East, South, West--

03:00.310 --> 03:02.312
See, this is why
we can only do basic magick.

03:02.486 --> 03:04.140
We've never had a fourth.

03:04.314 --> 03:07.056
How many times have we tried
to telepathically communicate?

03:07.230 --> 03:09.276
Oh, my God!
You're obsessed

03:09.450 --> 03:11.930
with telepathically
communicating.

03:12.104 --> 03:13.280
Read the book.

03:13.454 --> 03:16.370
"So it shall be sealed and done

03:16.544 --> 03:19.111
When all four corners
Meet as one"

03:38.392 --> 03:40.132
Wait, wait, wait.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.874
Oh, shit!

03:43.048 --> 03:44.441
It's your jam.Yes!

03:44.615 --> 03:45.964
Okay, here we go.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.018
Whoo!

04:13.035 --> 04:16.299
Shit. You know the words.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.869
Aw.Sorry.

04:21.043 --> 04:23.263
Aw, baby.Ugh. Blah.

04:23.437 --> 04:27.136
Oh, no, no, no.
You can...cry.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.877
All right, get it out.

04:30.008 --> 04:31.271
Oh, honey, I'm...

04:32.968 --> 04:35.231
I get it, man.
This is...

04:35.405 --> 04:37.799
This is weird,
though, isn't it?

04:39.583 --> 04:40.845
Oh...

04:41.019 --> 04:42.760
Look it, we're having
all the feels.

04:42.934 --> 04:45.241
You'll have to do my makeup
when we get there.

04:45.415 --> 04:47.243
Okay. I got you.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.027
Turn it back up, please.

05:12.660 --> 05:13.748
How are my brows?

05:13.922 --> 05:15.271
They look great.

05:15.445 --> 05:16.316
Okay.

05:18.361 --> 05:19.275
Okay.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.757
You look beautiful.

05:22.931 --> 05:23.975
Oh, gosh.

05:24.149 --> 05:25.499
You do.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.109
Okay. I do.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.070
You ready?I'm nervous.

05:32.244 --> 05:33.811
Yeah. Yeah.Okay.

05:36.727 --> 05:38.903
All right,
let's do this. Okay.

06:01.752 --> 06:02.797
Hello.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.581
Hey.Hey.

06:04.755 --> 06:07.236
I see you made it in one piece.Yeah, it's--

06:07.410 --> 06:08.542
Oh, God.

06:11.283 --> 06:13.460
Is that another piece of you
I see right here?

06:13.634 --> 06:16.114
Hi, Lily.
I finally got you here.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.378
It's nice to see you again.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.118
Last time was
on your turf though,

06:20.292 --> 06:22.033
so now it's
my home-court advantage.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.735
That's a sports metaphor.

06:27.909 --> 06:29.389
A metaphor,
sort of like analogy.

06:29.563 --> 06:30.433
Oh, yeah. I get it.

06:30.607 --> 06:31.695
Yeah, I get it.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.393
Dad joke. Guilty.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.700
That's a cool camera.

06:36.874 --> 06:38.398
Thanks. - It is, isn't it?

06:38.572 --> 06:41.662
Let's take a picture. You know?
Commemorate the moment.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.098
That's a great idea.

06:43.272 --> 06:44.578
May I?Okay.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.580
It's not really a selfie thing,
but here.

06:46.754 --> 06:47.668
Sure. How do I--?

06:47.842 --> 06:49.626
Ooh, wow, analog.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.194
Dig it. Old school.

06:52.368 --> 06:53.543
Ready?

06:56.851 --> 06:58.983
All right. Come on in
and meet the boys.

06:59.157 --> 07:00.724
They're really excited
to meet you.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.030
I think they even bathed.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.309
This is Isaiah.Hey.

07:20.483 --> 07:21.832
Jacob.Hi.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.051
And Abe.

07:25.183 --> 07:26.271
Hi.

07:47.075 --> 07:48.163
What the hell?

07:48.337 --> 07:49.599
Hey, give Lily
the good seat.

07:49.773 --> 07:50.818
Move over.

07:50.992 --> 07:53.255
Move.

07:53.429 --> 07:54.735
Isaiah, just move over!

07:54.909 --> 07:55.823
Cut it out, hey!

07:55.997 --> 07:57.825
Move.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.000
Settle down.

08:01.176 --> 08:03.874
A little birdie told me
mint chip was your favorite.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.528
Thanks.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.312
Isn't that right,
little birdie?
Mm-hm.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.010
My beautiful little birdie.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.796
That's gross, Dad.

08:22.632 --> 08:23.764
Hey.Hey.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.205
Nice digs.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.425
You okay?

08:33.600 --> 08:34.818
Yeah.

08:34.992 --> 08:36.646
How you feeling about
school tomorrow?

08:36.820 --> 08:37.691
Are you excited?

08:37.865 --> 08:39.344
You can make some new friends.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.564
Well, that would imply
that I had old friends.

08:41.738 --> 08:44.349
There's gonna be D-bags
no matter where you go, right?

08:44.524 --> 08:47.178
Mom. It's not nice.Sorry.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.702
It's "douchebags."

08:48.876 --> 08:51.008
"Douchebags"?
I was going for "dickbags."

08:54.098 --> 08:57.101
All right. Just remember
what I always tell you.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.060
Hmm?

08:59.234 --> 09:01.976
Your difference
is your power.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.197
Okay, on that note,
I'm gonna go unpack.

09:06.371 --> 09:07.329
Okay.

09:07.503 --> 09:09.113
Love you.I love you.

09:10.462 --> 09:11.768
Hey.

09:11.942 --> 09:14.205
Thank you for
just being so cool...

09:14.379 --> 09:15.293
Mom.

09:15.467 --> 09:16.556
...about all of this.

09:16.730 --> 09:17.774
I know it feels fast.

09:17.948 --> 09:19.602
Mom, I'm not judging you
at all.

09:19.776 --> 09:22.953
I just have not connected to
someone like this for so long,

09:23.127 --> 09:25.042
and, God, it just
feels really good,

09:25.216 --> 09:27.175
like, you know,
to have someone to...

09:27.349 --> 09:28.829
I get it.

09:29.003 --> 09:30.308
All right, baby.
Get some rest.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.136
Okay.

09:32.310 --> 09:33.790
Oh...love you.Love you.

09:33.964 --> 09:36.097
Love you, love you, love you.Love you, love you.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.235
What's up?

09:44.409 --> 09:45.541
Nice kicks.

09:45.715 --> 09:46.716
Thanks, yo.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.676
Have a good first day.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.329
Thanks.

09:55.116 --> 09:58.119
I know why the caged bird
Sings, ah me

09:58.293 --> 10:00.904
When his wing is bruised
And his bosom sore,--

10:01.078 --> 10:03.733
When he beats his bars
And he would be free;

10:03.907 --> 10:06.780
But a prayer that he sends
From his heart's deep core

10:06.954 --> 10:10.261
But a plea, that upward
To Heaven he flings--

10:10.435 --> 10:13.308
I know why
The caged bird sings!

10:13.482 --> 10:16.224
Okay, this week
we're gonna be reading

10:16.398 --> 10:18.182
chapters one through four

10:18.356 --> 10:21.316
of Maya Angelou's
seminal autobiography,

10:21.490 --> 10:23.100
which draws its title--

10:23.274 --> 10:25.102
Ew! God, are you
seeing this?

10:25.276 --> 10:26.408
Timmy.I'm sorry.

10:32.022 --> 10:34.329
Okay, what's going on? - Hey.

10:34.503 --> 10:38.507
Hi. I think
you dropped something.

10:41.205 --> 10:42.076
Wow.

10:47.951 --> 10:49.649
Oh, my God.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.476
It's super gnarly.

10:51.651 --> 10:55.655
Can we settle down back there,
please? Let's go. Jacob.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.221
It's like a crime scene.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.312
Hey, hey.
All right, enough.

11:01.486 --> 11:02.792
Settle down.

11:37.392 --> 11:38.393
Hello?

11:39.524 --> 11:41.744
I think she's in here.

11:41.918 --> 11:42.963
Hello?

11:49.143 --> 11:52.450
Listen. It happens to everyone.
Timmy's just a dick.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.496
Seriously, don't waste
your tears on him.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.237
I mean, you're not alone.

11:56.411 --> 11:58.413
He's made us all cry
at one point or another.

11:58.587 --> 12:00.197
Also, girl,

12:00.371 --> 12:03.853
your flow is heavy and that
is something to celebrate.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.507
Frankie.Frankie, bro.

12:05.681 --> 12:09.467
What? I'm just saying.
Aunt Flo's in from the Redland.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.208
We brought you some shorts.

12:11.382 --> 12:13.341
I wore 'em in gym,
so they're kinda sweaty,

12:13.515 --> 12:14.603
but they should fit you.

12:18.128 --> 12:22.089
Okay. Okay, I'll just
slide them under the door.

12:29.487 --> 12:30.358
Thank you.

12:40.324 --> 12:41.891
You can sit with us
if you want.

12:42.065 --> 12:44.981
Not that anybody really wants
to sit with us anyways.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.505
Thanks, guys.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.393
Oh, my God.
Did he just look at you?

13:05.567 --> 13:07.090
Down, girl.Frankie's been in love

13:07.264 --> 13:08.831
with Jacob
since the fifth grade.

13:09.005 --> 13:11.834
What? No, no. No.

13:12.008 --> 13:15.185
No.He's kinda my brother.

13:15.359 --> 13:16.404
Come a-who?

13:16.578 --> 13:18.058
Stepbrother.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.060
Or soon-to-be stepbrother.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.934
Sorry, I just have
really bad cramps.

13:25.108 --> 13:26.196
Been there. - Same.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.459
Can't relate, but sorry.

13:32.420 --> 13:33.551
Uh...

13:37.294 --> 13:39.166
Um...LILY: What?

13:39.340 --> 13:43.300
Hey, we should hang out
after school this week.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.041
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.

13:45.215 --> 13:46.086
Okay.

13:48.479 --> 13:49.611
Mom?

13:55.443 --> 13:57.227
Hello?

15:38.981 --> 15:40.156
Get out!

15:43.072 --> 15:45.205
Oh, God.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.705
Mmm. You want a sip?

16:07.879 --> 16:09.142
Sure.

16:10.708 --> 16:11.753
Mom!

16:11.927 --> 16:13.929
You know
I can't control myself.

16:15.235 --> 16:16.540
Ooh!

16:16.714 --> 16:19.935
That's very good.
Okay, okay.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.676
Show me
your dance moves.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.984
Oh, my gosh.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.814
That's so sweet.

17:00.149 --> 17:01.150
Hey.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.587
What's all that?

17:03.761 --> 17:06.503
Oh...I just had to go through
some paperwork

17:06.677 --> 17:08.418
for your new school,
but you know me.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.507
I put all the important shit
in a shoebox,

17:10.681 --> 17:12.248
and it makes it impossible
to find.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.469
Adam says he's gonna
get me organized,

17:15.643 --> 17:17.297
so I'm taking it
down to the office,

17:17.471 --> 17:19.516
but I told him
not to get his hopes up, so...

17:19.690 --> 17:23.651
Hey, um, thanks for washing
my jeans, by the way.

17:23.825 --> 17:24.956
What jeans?

17:26.436 --> 17:28.525
The ones
I bled through today.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.049
I didn't.

17:30.223 --> 17:32.007
Maybe it was Adam.

18:30.761 --> 18:33.808
Look who it is.
Just in time for first period.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.288
Timmy.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.246
You know what helps
with cramps?

18:38.900 --> 18:40.031
Sex.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.516
That was, like, insane.

18:46.690 --> 18:49.780
Both of you,
principal's office now.

19:07.885 --> 19:08.712
Lily.

19:08.886 --> 19:09.800
What?

19:11.585 --> 19:13.413
Ms. Schechner,
who are you speaking to?

19:15.023 --> 19:16.285
Didn't you just call my name?

19:16.459 --> 19:17.591
No.

19:22.117 --> 19:25.164
If you can hear this,
you're our fourth.

19:26.774 --> 19:28.428
Go to the bathroom.

19:31.344 --> 19:32.649
Yes?

19:32.823 --> 19:34.129
Can I go to the bathroom?

19:35.826 --> 19:37.132
Sure. Make it quick.

19:38.873 --> 19:40.179
Take your stuff.

19:44.835 --> 19:46.620
You need your backpack?

19:46.794 --> 19:48.143
You didn't get the memo?

19:48.317 --> 19:49.797
She's on the rag.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.063
My bad.

19:56.847 --> 19:59.023
That's good. Double detention.
Anything else?

19:59.198 --> 20:00.068
For what?

20:02.113 --> 20:04.986
Oh, shit! I told y'all haters
she was the fourth!

20:05.160 --> 20:06.509
Yes, yes, y'all!

20:06.683 --> 20:11.297
It's the motherfricking
reckoning!

20:11.471 --> 20:14.604
I can't even believe this.
We on a other, other level.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.476
What the hell, you guys?

20:16.650 --> 20:18.521
We sent you a message
telepathically.

20:18.695 --> 20:22.525
Yeah. Just, like, telepathically
communicating with you. NBD.

20:22.699 --> 20:26.616
JK. It's, like, a VBD for sure,
because now you're actually here

20:26.790 --> 20:28.357
and we on some shit IRL.

20:28.531 --> 20:30.185
Okay.
Can somebody translate?

20:30.359 --> 20:32.840
Okay. It was a test to see
if your antennas were up.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.755
And they up!Way up.

20:34.929 --> 20:36.757
They up!What do you mean? How?

20:36.931 --> 20:38.411
Well, we practiced
a lot of times,

20:38.585 --> 20:40.021
but we never got it
quite right.

20:40.195 --> 20:42.153
But, I mean, today,
it was like...

20:42.328 --> 20:45.244
Super Tampon
to the rescue!

20:45.418 --> 20:47.028
That's you.
Sorry, is it too soon?

20:47.202 --> 20:48.856
So how long have
you been practicing?

20:49.030 --> 20:50.814
Practicing?Yeah.

20:50.988 --> 20:55.950
Oh. No, I never, like,
practiced anything before.

20:56.124 --> 20:57.691
Okay, so, like,
when did you start

20:57.865 --> 20:59.258
getting a sense
of your gift?

21:00.302 --> 21:01.608
Um...

21:01.782 --> 21:04.045
What are you guys
talking about?

21:04.219 --> 21:05.960
What? - We're witches.

21:06.134 --> 21:07.875
Take my hand. It's okay.
Come with me.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.442
We're gonna learn
a lot today.

21:09.616 --> 21:11.052
You're witches?Yep.

21:11.226 --> 21:12.401
And you're
a witch too!

21:14.360 --> 21:16.797
Sorry, this is all
just a little new to me.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.581
I mean, it's new to us too.

21:18.755 --> 21:20.801
We've never thrown
a grown-ass man.

21:20.975 --> 21:22.411
That was so wild!

21:22.585 --> 21:24.892
Yeah, and, like, we all
thought it at the same time.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.850
Wait, what?

21:27.024 --> 21:30.027
Tell me you didn't think about
throwing his ass off of you.

21:30.201 --> 21:32.421
Yeah, I did. - Well, so did we!

21:32.595 --> 21:34.249
And then, bam!

21:34.423 --> 21:36.860
And that's just stage one,
moving stuff with our minds.

21:37.034 --> 21:40.124
Or people, I guess,
in Timmy's case.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.127
If he even counts as a person.True that. Anything.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.652
Stage two? That's what
went down in detention.

21:45.826 --> 21:48.481
That was so sick!
And you said we couldn't do it.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.352
Stage three,
we'll get to soon enough.

21:50.526 --> 21:52.180
Let's surprise her, though.

21:52.354 --> 21:55.139
Stage four,
shape-shifting.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.924
Shape-shifting.

21:57.098 --> 21:59.709
You know, the power
to take on a different form?

21:59.883 --> 22:01.537
And if we get
to stage four,

22:01.711 --> 22:04.627
I'm low-key turning myself
into Kristen Stewart.

22:04.801 --> 22:07.151
Don't judge.
She's a Twilightstan.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.719
Point is, we've never made it
past stage one.

22:09.893 --> 22:11.634
And then in walks
Robert Pattinson.

22:11.808 --> 22:13.070
Bro!

22:13.244 --> 22:15.421
What? You tell me
she's not giving off

22:15.595 --> 22:17.379
Edward Cullen
vibes right now.

22:17.553 --> 22:19.555
I'm sorry, can you guys
just slow down?

22:19.729 --> 22:21.470
I'm having a hard time
catching up.

22:21.644 --> 22:24.081
Okay, well, why don't you
tell us a little about you.

22:24.255 --> 22:25.735
Yeah, like,
what's your ancestry?

22:25.909 --> 22:28.912
Uh...I don't really know.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.001
I've never
looked into it before.

22:31.175 --> 22:32.438
What about your mom?

22:33.569 --> 22:35.092
Is she a witch?

22:35.266 --> 22:37.878
She's a therapist
from New Jersey.

22:38.052 --> 22:39.619
It's gotta come
from somewhere.

22:39.793 --> 22:41.490
Yeah, you see,
we've been looking

22:41.664 --> 22:43.318
for our fourth
for a while now.

22:43.492 --> 22:46.016
We thought we could form
a coven, just us three--

22:46.190 --> 22:47.714
It doesn't work
like that.

22:47.888 --> 22:49.759
No, because,
you see, we each have

22:49.933 --> 22:52.283
an element that corresponds
to a direction.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.024
I'm fire.

22:54.198 --> 22:55.896
Air.Earth.

22:56.070 --> 22:59.290
So you've got
North, South, East...

22:59.465 --> 23:02.163
But West,
that was a tough get.

23:02.337 --> 23:04.252
And now you're here.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.341
You're water.
You're West.

23:06.515 --> 23:09.475
Yeah, in order for us to have,
like, maximum power,

23:09.649 --> 23:11.564
we all need to be
on our directions.

23:11.738 --> 23:13.870
The term is
"calling the corners."

23:14.044 --> 23:15.350
Okay. Um...

23:15.524 --> 23:18.962
This is a lot,
but I am listening

23:19.136 --> 23:24.011
and also working through
a low-level panic attack.

23:24.185 --> 23:27.057
Okay, we know that
this is probably a lot

23:27.231 --> 23:29.320
to take in right now.

23:29.495 --> 23:32.498
But you shouldn't run
from your power.

23:32.672 --> 23:33.977
None of us should.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.459
That's what my mom
always says.

23:37.633 --> 23:39.592
"Your difference
is your power."

23:39.766 --> 23:41.507
Oh, then Mom's cool.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.030
So, what do you say?

23:46.555 --> 23:47.730
Lily.

23:47.904 --> 23:49.340
Oh, my God,
Frankie.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.255
Give me your hand.
Come on.

23:53.823 --> 23:55.651
Will you be our fourth?

24:02.136 --> 24:03.877
Come on, I got bad knees.

24:04.051 --> 24:05.531
Her ACLs
are gonna tear.

24:10.013 --> 24:12.886
You had me at shape-shifting
into Kristen Stewart.

24:15.715 --> 24:18.805
She said yes! She said yes.Oh, my God!

24:18.979 --> 24:21.024
Why didn't you
just say yes originally?

24:23.636 --> 24:26.639
I mean, witchcraft in general
is such a charged word.

24:26.813 --> 24:29.468
We literally house babies
in our stomachs.

24:29.642 --> 24:31.513
That's some
Ridley Scott shit.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.689
We have superpowers
without even trying.

24:33.863 --> 24:36.213
I mean, not allof us
can do that, but...

24:36.387 --> 24:39.521
Shit. You know, point taken.
My bad, Lou.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.784
Yeah, it's all good.
Y'all know trans girls

24:41.958 --> 24:43.264
got our own magick anyway.

24:43.438 --> 24:44.874
Word.
They do, they do.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.355
That's why covens have
always been so important.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.488
Because half the battle
of having powers

24:49.662 --> 24:51.664
is believing you do.

24:51.838 --> 24:52.926
What are we doing?

24:53.100 --> 24:54.928
Well, now that
we got our fourth,

24:55.102 --> 24:57.408
we need to take our coven
for a test drive.

24:59.585 --> 25:02.631
Whenever we do a spell,
we always cast a circle first.

25:02.805 --> 25:05.068
Think of it as, you know,
making a container

25:05.242 --> 25:06.679
to hold all of our energies.

25:06.853 --> 25:08.289
And to keep
the bad shit out.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.599
Breathe.

25:22.521 --> 25:26.394
Listen to the sound of the trees
breathing along with you.

25:28.004 --> 25:30.485
Feel yourself rooted
into the ground

25:30.659 --> 25:32.705
and into this moment.

25:34.358 --> 25:36.752
We transcend time.

25:36.926 --> 25:39.146
We suspend fate.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.583
We bear the three keys.

25:41.757 --> 25:43.280
Oh, shit.

25:43.454 --> 25:45.500
We open the triple gate.

25:46.849 --> 25:49.983
We open the triple gate.

25:50.157 --> 25:53.421
FRANKIE, LOURDES & TABBY:
The air, the fire,
the water, the earth

25:53.595 --> 25:56.206
Return, return, return

25:56.380 --> 25:59.296
The air, the fire,
the water, the earth

25:59.470 --> 26:01.429
Return, return, return

26:01.603 --> 26:04.475
The air, the fire,
the water, the earth

26:04.650 --> 26:06.303
Return, return, return

26:06.477 --> 26:08.958
The air, the fire,
the water, the earth

26:09.132 --> 26:10.873
Return, return, return

26:11.047 --> 26:13.833
The air, the fire,
the water, the earth

26:14.007 --> 26:15.922
Return, return, return.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.620
The air, the fire,
the water, the earth

26:18.794 --> 26:20.143
Return, return, return

26:48.041 --> 26:49.564
Um...

26:51.174 --> 26:52.523
Guys.

26:56.005 --> 26:57.877
Holy shit.

27:03.186 --> 27:05.058
Damn!

27:05.232 --> 27:08.017
Oh, my God!That was so fricking cool!

27:08.191 --> 27:09.758
What?

27:09.932 --> 27:11.586
That was brazy, though!

27:12.674 --> 27:13.632
Never?

27:15.242 --> 27:16.896
Yo! No, no, no. No!

27:17.070 --> 27:18.985
That's stage three, baby.

27:19.159 --> 27:21.814
Okay, but if we could do that,
now what should we do?

27:21.988 --> 27:22.902
Hmm?

27:25.078 --> 27:26.383
Why are we
at Timmy's house?

27:26.557 --> 27:27.950
He's a terrorist.

27:28.124 --> 27:29.735
That's a little
extreme.

27:29.909 --> 27:32.563
We don't wanna hurt him,
though, right?

27:32.738 --> 27:33.913
Why not?

27:34.087 --> 27:36.567
No, she's right.
Hexing is serious.

27:36.742 --> 27:37.960
So is harassment.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.441
Everybody relax.
We're not hexing him.

27:40.615 --> 27:42.399
We'll just cast a spell
to make him

27:42.573 --> 27:43.879
less of a garbage person.

27:44.053 --> 27:45.925
How do you know no one's home?

27:46.099 --> 27:47.535
Bull's-eye.Ha, ha!

27:47.709 --> 27:48.797
Come on.

27:54.585 --> 27:55.978
Oh, my God.

27:56.152 --> 27:58.372
I'll take the lead
on this one.

28:01.027 --> 28:02.332
I can wing it.

28:02.506 --> 28:04.770
You guys,
we shouldn't be doing this.

28:04.944 --> 28:06.249
Okay, we need something

28:06.423 --> 28:09.165
from his physical person
to cast the spell.

28:09.339 --> 28:10.471
Twist.

28:11.994 --> 28:14.605
No way. No way.
Timmy full of surprises.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.520
Naw, this boy has
a Ouija board?

28:16.695 --> 28:18.305
Guys?

28:18.479 --> 28:21.351
I think I found something
from his physical person.

28:21.525 --> 28:24.877
Oh, no way.No. No. That is not a used--

28:25.051 --> 28:27.793
Low-key kinda surprised
he used a condom.

28:27.967 --> 28:29.359
Frankie,
don't touch that!

28:29.533 --> 28:31.710
Come on, it's...

28:31.884 --> 28:34.495
It's definitely
his most powerful element.

28:34.669 --> 28:37.672
I hate to give it to her,
but Frankie's kinda right, guys.

28:38.891 --> 28:41.676
This is so gross.

28:41.850 --> 28:43.896
Okay.
We need a caldron.

28:44.070 --> 28:45.201
What?

28:49.031 --> 28:51.033
Bong.

28:52.469 --> 28:53.427
Okay, what do I do?

28:53.601 --> 28:54.776
Rose oil.

28:57.648 --> 28:59.172
Hurl. I'm gonna hurl.

29:02.175 --> 29:04.786
Don't let it
touch you, bro.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.876
Don't! Frankie. Bro.

29:08.050 --> 29:08.964
Angelica.

29:09.138 --> 29:10.226
Rose quartz.

29:11.401 --> 29:12.315
Okay.

29:19.758 --> 29:24.458
We call upon
the Goddess of Holy Mysteries.

29:24.632 --> 29:25.546
You're doin' it.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.244
In spirit and in body...

29:29.768 --> 29:33.641
and in perfect love
and perfect trust,

29:33.815 --> 29:35.556
may we...

29:35.730 --> 29:37.732
awaken Timmy to his, uh...

29:38.864 --> 29:40.779
to his highest self.

29:40.953 --> 29:42.563
From this day forth.

29:43.782 --> 29:44.826
Blessed be.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.349
Blessed be.

29:48.221 --> 29:50.571
Do it, girl. - Do it.

29:50.745 --> 29:52.965
Get it. - Get it on that pillow.

29:53.139 --> 29:54.314
Gross!Do it.

29:56.055 --> 29:57.012
Timmy?Shit, guys.

29:57.186 --> 29:58.666
Shit!Oh, my God.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.015
Shit!

30:00.189 --> 30:02.148
No!What do we do?

30:02.322 --> 30:03.627
We gotta jump.
We gotta jump.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.455
There's a clear shot
out this window.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.022
We're on
the second story.

30:07.196 --> 30:09.155
It's our only option.
Come on.

30:09.329 --> 30:11.592
Can't you guys just make us fly
or something?

30:11.766 --> 30:13.159
Bitch, no!

30:18.686 --> 30:21.732
Timmy, no video games
until you finish your homework.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.212
Yeah, I know, Dad.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.526
Lily! Come on!

30:40.360 --> 30:41.404
Run!

31:31.802 --> 31:33.326
Yes!

31:55.696 --> 31:57.828
She taught us all
to read auras.

32:05.488 --> 32:06.925
Blessed be thy sight

32:10.102 --> 32:12.408
The Maiden, The Mother,
The Crone

32:12.582 --> 32:15.237
The Maiden,
The Mother, The Crone

32:15.411 --> 32:17.457
The Maiden, The Mother,
The Crone

32:26.814 --> 32:28.468
'Sup, bitch!I'm sorry.

32:28.642 --> 32:30.861
What you gonna do about it?
What are yougonna do?

32:37.956 --> 32:39.044
Air.Fire.

32:39.218 --> 32:40.132
Water.Earth.

32:40.306 --> 32:41.133
Air.Fire.

32:41.307 --> 32:42.177
Water.Earth.

33:01.501 --> 33:03.111
Lily.Hey.

33:03.285 --> 33:05.026
I was starting
to get a little worried.

33:05.200 --> 33:08.508
Yeah, sorry, I was just
hanging out with my friends.

33:08.682 --> 33:10.075
Friends?

33:10.249 --> 33:12.251
Yes. Radical, I know.

33:14.079 --> 33:16.037
Hey, Helen,
is Lily up there with you?

33:16.211 --> 33:19.214
Listen, sweetie,
we gotta talk about something.

33:19.388 --> 33:22.435
Um, I get back from
a week away doing groups

33:22.609 --> 33:25.220
and Jacob tells me
you assaulted Timmy Andrews?

33:25.394 --> 33:28.180
No, I was
defending myself.

33:28.354 --> 33:30.617
He said Timmy
didn't lay a hand on you.

33:30.791 --> 33:32.619
Well, he whispered
something in my ear--

33:32.793 --> 33:34.621
He whispered something
so you hit him?

33:34.795 --> 33:36.362
Well, if you'd just
let me finish--

33:36.536 --> 33:39.104
When I am speaking,
please don't interrupt me.

33:39.278 --> 33:41.106
Uh, okay...Thank you.

33:41.845 --> 33:43.543
Mom, please--

33:43.717 --> 33:46.807
Adam, let's take a step back
here for a second, all right?

33:46.981 --> 33:48.635
She was defending herself.

33:48.809 --> 33:52.552
Well, I'm sure the circumstances
were complicated, but...

33:52.726 --> 33:54.032
You know, with my boys,

33:54.206 --> 33:56.382
I have to have
a zero-tolerance policy

33:56.556 --> 33:58.079
when it comes to violence.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.995
That's the way it's always been
in this house. So...

34:01.169 --> 34:03.737
More than anything,
I'm disappointed, Lily, in you.

34:03.911 --> 34:06.000
Really disappointed
in you.

34:13.138 --> 34:16.184
Wow. Way to stick it
to the man, Mom.

34:16.358 --> 34:17.229
Lily.

34:21.233 --> 34:22.799
You just need to be more kind

34:22.973 --> 34:24.410
in the way
that you speak to her.

34:24.584 --> 34:26.194
Kind? - Yes!

34:26.368 --> 34:28.414
Yeah, discipline,
it's all about kindness.

34:28.588 --> 34:29.980
That's not what I meant.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.591
She has an attitude, Helen.

34:31.765 --> 34:33.897
She comes in here
all holier-than-thou.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.595
It's uncomfortable
for everyone.

34:35.769 --> 34:37.684
It's complicated for her!

34:45.692 --> 34:46.606
Hey.

34:46.780 --> 34:47.824
Sorry.

34:47.998 --> 34:49.696
What are you doing out here?

34:49.870 --> 34:52.264
I just like
to come here to think.

34:53.917 --> 34:56.268
Get away from the noise.
You know?

34:58.357 --> 34:59.401
Yeah.

35:09.063 --> 35:13.937
Listen, my dad can be strict
but he does it out of love.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.417
You know?

35:18.333 --> 35:20.118
He always says:

35:20.292 --> 35:22.555
"Power equals order."

35:22.729 --> 35:26.472
I mean, there's a reason why
he's gotten to where he has.

35:26.646 --> 35:28.604
People travel
from all over the world

35:28.778 --> 35:31.129
to hear him speak
about this kind of stuff.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.480
Right.

35:38.048 --> 35:40.225
So, what about your dad?

35:40.399 --> 35:41.965
Um...

35:43.228 --> 35:44.620
I've never met him.

35:47.319 --> 35:48.929
I don't even know
his name.

35:57.111 --> 35:59.809
So you two wanna have sex.

35:59.983 --> 36:01.420
Let's talk ground rules.

36:01.594 --> 36:03.987
Number one: Consent.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.903
At any moment,
it is your right to say stop.

36:07.077 --> 36:08.818
Sure, if you wanna give him
blue balls.

36:08.992 --> 36:10.907
Hey, Jeremy.I'm sorry.

36:11.081 --> 36:13.171
Consent is defined
as an affirmative,

36:13.345 --> 36:15.303
unambiguous
and a voluntary agreement.

36:15.477 --> 36:19.351
So yes, and only yes,
means yes.

36:19.525 --> 36:22.136
Yes, yes, yes-yes-yes!

36:22.310 --> 36:23.833
Oh, my God,
shut up, Jeremy.

36:24.007 --> 36:25.270
Okay, thank you, Timmy.

36:25.444 --> 36:27.402
I'm sorry.
It's super inappropriate.

36:27.576 --> 36:30.579
Can you please send him to
the principal's office already?

36:30.753 --> 36:33.408
I mean, he's making so many
people here uncomfortable.

36:33.582 --> 36:35.236
Give me a break.
I was joking.

36:35.410 --> 36:38.239
No, it can trigger
a lot of shit for people, okay?

36:38.413 --> 36:41.111
So why don't you just try being
a little bit more sensitive

36:41.286 --> 36:43.375
and just...

36:43.549 --> 36:45.464
Just listen. Okay?

36:45.638 --> 36:47.030
Whatever.

36:53.646 --> 36:55.387
Yo, he called himself
cisgendered

36:55.561 --> 36:57.737
in seventh period today.

36:57.911 --> 36:58.955
Turn to me.

37:02.872 --> 37:04.004
Girl.

37:05.658 --> 37:07.573
In eighth period,
he went on a tear

37:07.747 --> 37:09.052
about heteronormativity.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.229
Oh, my God, Tabs.

37:11.403 --> 37:13.056
I love that nail.
That's fire.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.145
Yeah...

37:15.320 --> 37:16.538
Oh, snap!

37:16.712 --> 37:18.758
Hey, listen.
We don't know for sure

37:18.932 --> 37:20.803
that this Timmy stuff
is because of us.

37:20.977 --> 37:23.676
But all signs point to
"it definitely is."

37:23.850 --> 37:26.461
Well, we'll certainly see
at his party tonight.

37:26.635 --> 37:28.028
Scene of the crime.

37:28.202 --> 37:29.812
But we need to proceed
with caution.

37:29.986 --> 37:32.206
Agreed. These kinds
of spells are no joke.

37:32.380 --> 37:33.947
From now on,
when it comes to Timmy,

37:34.121 --> 37:35.949
we need to talk through
everything we do,

37:36.123 --> 37:37.385
how we do it and when.
Okay?

37:42.347 --> 37:43.348
Lily.

37:43.522 --> 37:45.785
Hm?You got all that?

37:45.959 --> 37:47.787
Yeah. Yeah.

37:47.961 --> 37:51.181
All right, well, enough with
the melo. Picture time!

37:56.361 --> 37:58.363
Work, witches.

38:00.843 --> 38:03.019
Yeah, so, anyways...
Oh, my God.

38:06.588 --> 38:07.720
Hey, Shelly.

38:07.894 --> 38:10.113
You know my favorite
kind of movie?

38:10.288 --> 38:11.680
Period pieces.

38:13.943 --> 38:15.336
I'm gonna
go to the bathroom.

38:17.382 --> 38:19.297
Tampons are
in the medicine cabinet.

38:19.471 --> 38:22.082
It's super cool
to shame other girls.

38:22.256 --> 38:23.953
You're the best!

38:24.127 --> 38:28.393
It's so sad that you, like,
tryto look pretty.

38:33.572 --> 38:35.008
Ah!

38:35.182 --> 38:36.357
Careful.

38:36.531 --> 38:38.316
Words hurt.

38:40.187 --> 38:42.450
Bye.What the heck?

38:42.624 --> 38:45.279
Oh, my God. No, I'm fine.
Honestly, I'm fine.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.419
Hey.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.943
You looking for the bathroom?

38:57.117 --> 38:59.772
There's one
just down the hall.

38:59.946 --> 39:03.166
I mean, there's one in there,
but it seems...

39:03.341 --> 39:04.820
otherwise occupied.

39:06.039 --> 39:06.953
Right.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.261
Lily, uh...

39:11.436 --> 39:13.655
I think
I owe you an apology.

39:14.700 --> 39:17.616
The other day, I was...

39:17.790 --> 39:19.748
What's the word
I'm looking for?

39:19.922 --> 39:22.098
An asshole?

39:22.272 --> 39:26.320
Yeah. Yeah, no, that's, uh...

39:26.494 --> 39:27.756
That's the word.

39:29.323 --> 39:31.543
I guess it has to do
with power,

39:31.717 --> 39:33.675
and me shaming you
around something

39:33.849 --> 39:35.982
that's already pretty
vulnerable, so...

39:37.375 --> 39:39.202
I guess what
I'm trying to say is...

39:40.987 --> 39:42.075
sorry.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.601
Hey. You good?

39:46.775 --> 39:47.820
Yeah.

39:47.994 --> 39:49.691
Yeah, I'm good.

39:49.865 --> 39:52.346
I'm not drinking tonight,
but if you really wanna party,

39:52.520 --> 39:54.174
I've got this secret stash
of LaCroix

39:54.348 --> 39:55.697
in the fridge downstairs.

39:55.871 --> 39:59.222
I also compiled this
super eclectic playlist,

39:59.397 --> 40:01.703
and I'm open
to any requests.

40:01.877 --> 40:03.749
I think more than anything,

40:03.923 --> 40:06.055
tonight I really
just wanna dance.

40:06.229 --> 40:08.188
Yeah.Mm-hm.

40:08.362 --> 40:12.584
All right. Sorry.
I'll scoot by.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.803
Oh, my God!

40:16.457 --> 40:17.980
I'm just gonna go ahead
and say it.

40:18.154 --> 40:20.026
I'm really
into Woke Timmy.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.507
What about proceeding
with caution?

40:22.681 --> 40:25.031
Lily's right.
We have to be really careful.

40:25.205 --> 40:27.729
We've never used a dude's--Okay, don't. Oh.

40:27.903 --> 40:29.905
You don't have to remind me.

40:30.079 --> 40:32.255
Oh, snap.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.997
Oh, he's playing
Princess Nokia.

40:37.130 --> 40:39.045
Bye!

40:39.219 --> 40:41.700
I mean, I just love
her politics, you know?

40:41.874 --> 40:43.266
Totally.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.355
I mean, just the way
she uses her artistry

40:45.530 --> 40:48.097
to deal with race politics
and gender politics

40:48.271 --> 40:50.752
and still just makes,
like, the sickest pop jams.

40:50.926 --> 40:53.102
I read this interview
with Janet Mock--

40:57.367 --> 40:59.979
Oh, let me
get you a glass.

41:00.153 --> 41:01.284
Chivalrous.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.461
Wow, the bar
is that low, huh?

41:05.854 --> 41:06.812
Here you go.Thank you.

41:06.986 --> 41:08.030
Of course.

41:08.204 --> 41:10.293
I like your necklace.

41:11.381 --> 41:13.906
Oh.What's that symbol?

41:14.080 --> 41:18.040
I don't know. My mom gave it
to me when I was little.

41:18.214 --> 41:19.781
It's dope.

41:22.131 --> 41:25.613
My mom gave me
a necklace too.

41:25.787 --> 41:29.617
Guess it's a thing, you know?
Moms and necklaces.

41:29.791 --> 41:32.968
I used to think
it was kinda whack, but...

41:33.142 --> 41:34.361
Yeah, I don't know.

41:34.535 --> 41:36.581
It's a nice thing,
ever since she died,

41:36.755 --> 41:38.104
to just remember her by.

41:40.672 --> 41:41.716
When did she...?

41:41.890 --> 41:42.935
When I was 11.

41:44.589 --> 41:45.981
I'm sorry.

41:46.155 --> 41:47.940
No. It's fine.

41:53.162 --> 41:55.861
Can I tell you something
kind of embarrassing?

41:56.035 --> 41:58.124
Sure.

41:58.298 --> 42:03.782
I still talk to her.
Or try to.

42:03.956 --> 42:07.960
I know that's kind of woo-woo
or whatever, but, um...

42:08.134 --> 42:13.269
I have this Ouija board from
when I was a kid, and, um...

42:13.443 --> 42:15.881
I use it sometimes
to try...

42:17.709 --> 42:20.015
and reach out, I guess.

42:20.189 --> 42:22.409
I don't think that's
embarrassing at all.
Okay.

42:22.583 --> 42:26.805
I mean, if I'd lost my mom,
I'd do the same thing.

42:30.460 --> 42:31.549
Has it worked?

42:32.724 --> 42:35.074
Yeah. Yeah.

42:35.248 --> 42:36.554
What did she say?

42:37.772 --> 42:39.252
She told me
to clean my room.

42:39.426 --> 42:43.125
No.Yeah. Like, she really did.

42:43.299 --> 42:45.432
That must've taken
a really long time

42:45.606 --> 42:47.260
to spell out
on a Ouija board.

42:47.434 --> 42:49.828
It was definitely, like,
a good five minutes

42:50.002 --> 42:51.481
or something like that.

42:51.656 --> 42:53.048
Guys.

42:53.222 --> 42:55.834
Lily, you need to come
right now. It's a party.

42:56.008 --> 42:57.139
Yeah. Okay.Yes. Yes.

42:58.140 --> 42:59.011
Do it.

43:53.761 --> 43:56.242
Yo, dude, we need to talk
about our science project.

43:56.416 --> 43:58.113
Are you coming to eat
with us or what?

43:58.287 --> 43:59.288
Yeah. Yeah.

43:59.462 --> 44:00.768
I'll catch
you guys later?

44:00.942 --> 44:02.509
Girls.

44:02.683 --> 44:04.163
Women.

44:05.555 --> 44:07.557
No, womxn with an X.

44:09.211 --> 44:11.083
All right.

44:23.443 --> 44:24.357
I got next.

44:24.531 --> 44:25.532
Don't touch that.

44:27.316 --> 44:28.535
Isaiah.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.070
What the shit?

44:42.244 --> 44:43.811
You still staying for dinner?

44:43.985 --> 44:45.726
Yeah, I mean,
if it's cool with you.

44:45.900 --> 44:46.901
Yeah. It's cool.

44:51.601 --> 44:52.777
Yo, I'm going out.

44:54.256 --> 44:56.606
Let's go upstairs.Okay.

44:56.781 --> 45:00.523
Wait, let's all hang together.
Yeah?

45:00.698 --> 45:02.569
I mean...

45:02.743 --> 45:05.006
Sure.Jacob?

45:05.180 --> 45:06.921
Look, we can do this stuff
in an hour.

45:07.095 --> 45:08.662
Let's just hang out
with the girls.

45:08.836 --> 45:10.664
Yeah, no, I'm good.
You go ahead.

45:10.838 --> 45:11.752
Wait, you sure?

45:11.926 --> 45:12.884
Yup.

45:14.015 --> 45:15.364
Suit yourself, dude.

45:15.538 --> 45:17.366
Let's go.

45:17.540 --> 45:18.628
Come on!

45:20.500 --> 45:23.285
So you've really never played
Two Truths One Lie before?

45:23.459 --> 45:24.373
No.

45:25.592 --> 45:27.594
Well, get ready.

45:27.768 --> 45:30.553
Are you sure we shouldn't check
with Jacob one more time?

45:30.728 --> 45:32.642
"Clean your room."

45:32.817 --> 45:34.340
Maybe he changed his mind.

45:34.514 --> 45:35.994
Okay, who wants to go first?

45:36.168 --> 45:38.431
And then, like,
maybe we could make this

45:38.605 --> 45:40.041
a Spin the Bottle
situation.

45:40.215 --> 45:41.695
Jesus.Oh, my God!

45:41.869 --> 45:44.872
I'll go first. I'll go first.Thank you.

45:45.046 --> 45:46.787
Okay. Um...

45:46.961 --> 45:48.746
I wish I had
more Black friends.

45:50.312 --> 45:53.881
I am scared for
my brother's safety every day.

45:54.055 --> 45:56.971
And I don't like Beyoncé.

45:57.145 --> 45:58.668
Okay, someone else.

45:58.843 --> 46:00.583
You didn't let us guess.

46:00.758 --> 46:02.107
Well, I said three truths.

46:02.281 --> 46:03.804
Wait, you don't like
Beyoncé?

46:03.978 --> 46:05.240
No, bitch.

46:05.414 --> 46:06.502
I love her.

46:10.419 --> 46:11.464
I'll go.

46:13.248 --> 46:14.946
Um...

46:16.774 --> 46:18.906
So my mom gave me this.

46:22.170 --> 46:23.302
And I'm a virgin.

46:23.476 --> 46:24.825
What?

46:28.307 --> 46:29.221
Lie!

46:29.395 --> 46:30.439
What the hell, man?

46:30.613 --> 46:31.832
That's a lie.You don't know.

46:32.006 --> 46:33.181
Yeah, I know.

46:33.355 --> 46:34.748
You don't know.
You don't.

46:34.922 --> 46:36.010
Shut up, bro.

46:36.184 --> 46:37.925
Um...

46:38.099 --> 46:40.362
And, uh...

46:43.931 --> 46:45.367
Isaiah and I hooked up.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.028
Wait.

46:54.202 --> 46:56.161
Shit, um...

46:56.335 --> 47:00.208
I'm sorry.
I don't know why...

47:00.382 --> 47:01.340
It's okay.

47:02.515 --> 47:04.952
You can talk to us.

47:09.087 --> 47:10.044
Well, um...

47:13.482 --> 47:15.397
It was...

47:15.571 --> 47:17.008
I'm sorry, I just--

47:19.793 --> 47:21.795
I've never told anyone
this before.

47:22.448 --> 47:23.492
And...

47:25.016 --> 47:26.713
It's like...

47:26.887 --> 47:29.629
Jacob's my best friend.

47:30.978 --> 47:33.633
And he would...

47:33.807 --> 47:37.506
Have you and Isaiah
ever talked about it?

47:37.680 --> 47:38.768
You kidding me?

47:40.292 --> 47:43.208
He won't even look at me
since it happened.

47:49.257 --> 47:50.302
Shit.

47:52.652 --> 47:53.653
I'm sorry.

47:56.743 --> 47:58.049
Um...

47:59.746 --> 48:00.878
It's just...

48:02.662 --> 48:06.448
It's felt good when it's
been with girls as well, so...

48:09.451 --> 48:11.453
Oh, God. I don't know.

48:13.325 --> 48:15.327
It's just hard for dudes.

48:15.501 --> 48:18.634
I feel like
there's no room to be...

48:20.898 --> 48:23.857
Everyone just assumes you're
just gay, and that's fine.

48:24.031 --> 48:27.426
You know, there's nothing wrong
with that at all.

48:29.036 --> 48:30.124
I just...

48:33.475 --> 48:35.869
I like both. You know?

48:38.002 --> 48:38.959
Hello?

48:40.265 --> 48:41.701
Oh, shit.
You guys gotta leave.

48:41.875 --> 48:43.094
Wait, what? - I'm sorry.

48:43.268 --> 48:44.922
He's gonna kill us
if he hears us.

48:45.096 --> 48:46.793
Okay. Over there.

48:46.967 --> 48:49.927
Look, I'll go
distract him. Okay?

49:01.068 --> 49:04.550
Isaiah told you he's not
coming home for dinner?

49:04.724 --> 49:06.552
Yeah, he went out.
I don't know.

49:07.727 --> 49:08.815
He what?

49:10.686 --> 49:11.861
Yeah, he went out.

49:21.001 --> 49:23.047
Dad, how was your trip?

49:25.092 --> 49:26.615
It was good.

49:26.789 --> 49:29.227
It was real good.
Thanks for asking.

49:29.401 --> 49:31.794
Made some real breakthroughs
in some of my groups.

49:31.969 --> 49:33.231
Oh, yeah?Yeah.

49:33.405 --> 49:34.275
Like what?

49:37.017 --> 49:40.934
There's a lot of pain
for these men

49:41.108 --> 49:43.458
living
just under the surface,

49:43.632 --> 49:45.634
especially now.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.514
I'll get the chicken.

49:55.688 --> 49:58.212
Mm. Here, let me help.It's fine.

49:58.386 --> 50:00.345
No, I want to.

50:00.519 --> 50:02.086
Fine.

50:04.479 --> 50:05.654
Thank you.

51:29.608 --> 51:32.306
As this garment
glows in light,

51:32.480 --> 51:35.527
I draw you closer to me
this night.

52:14.566 --> 52:16.002
Hi, I was just
wondering

52:16.176 --> 52:17.830
if I left my sweatshirt
in here.

52:18.004 --> 52:19.875
Um...

52:21.007 --> 52:23.270
No. No, I don't think so.

52:23.444 --> 52:24.576
Are you, uh...

52:24.750 --> 52:26.534
Were you going to bed?

52:26.708 --> 52:28.536
It's only, like, 8:00.

52:28.710 --> 52:30.016
No, I'm, um...

52:30.190 --> 52:32.845
I'm, um, meditating.

52:33.019 --> 52:34.455
Oh. Shit.Yeah.

52:34.629 --> 52:37.415
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt...

52:37.589 --> 52:39.156
No. No, it's cool.

52:47.860 --> 52:48.991
You take these?

52:49.166 --> 52:51.080
Yeah.

53:00.525 --> 53:02.353
They're amazing.

53:02.527 --> 53:03.658
Thanks.

53:05.878 --> 53:07.271
Listen, I, uh...

53:09.142 --> 53:12.667
I just wanna say,
um, thank you.

53:14.060 --> 53:15.453
For today.

53:17.498 --> 53:19.544
I just feel like
a massive...

53:22.373 --> 53:24.462
weight lifted
off my shoulders.

53:26.551 --> 53:28.814
Like I can just
finally be myself.

53:31.425 --> 53:33.297
If that makes sense.

53:33.471 --> 53:34.559
It does.

54:08.114 --> 54:09.420
Hey, Timmy!

54:10.769 --> 54:12.510
Uh...

54:14.076 --> 54:16.905
I guess biology calls.Okay.

54:20.387 --> 54:23.303
I mean, you know...

54:23.477 --> 54:25.436
the other biology.

54:25.610 --> 54:26.785
Right.

54:26.959 --> 54:29.962
Timmy, Jacob's been
calling for you.

54:30.136 --> 54:33.008
Um, I was just looking
for my sweatshirt.

54:45.064 --> 54:46.935
I'm sorry.

54:55.292 --> 54:57.206
Yeah, I'm gonna--Okay.

54:57.381 --> 54:59.165
Yeah, okay.See ya.

55:04.518 --> 55:05.519
Oh, my...!

57:03.681 --> 57:07.206
Isaiah. Are you sleepwalking
again? Come on.

57:07.380 --> 57:10.078
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

57:11.732 --> 57:13.212
Let's get you back to bed.

57:24.223 --> 57:26.094
What? Excuse me!

57:29.271 --> 57:30.795
Okay, uh...

57:30.969 --> 57:32.361
Um, quiet down, please.

57:33.754 --> 57:35.843
I have some
very difficult news

57:36.017 --> 57:38.106
to share with you
this morning.

57:38.280 --> 57:39.499
Um...

57:42.676 --> 57:45.418
This morning, Timmy Andrews
was found dead in his bedroom.

57:49.030 --> 57:52.469
The cause of death is believed
to have been suicide.

57:55.646 --> 57:57.517
There are counselors...

58:13.359 --> 58:14.708
Lily.

58:19.278 --> 58:21.019
This can't be happening.

58:22.847 --> 58:25.153
He was just here.

58:25.327 --> 58:26.633
I mean...

58:28.461 --> 58:29.897
Do you think that...?

58:33.335 --> 58:36.730
Do you think
that we're sort of responsible?

58:38.602 --> 58:42.519
It's, like, he told us
this huge secret.

58:44.651 --> 58:48.307
This huge secret that he clearly
was not ready to deal with.

58:48.481 --> 58:49.395
No.

58:50.875 --> 58:53.268
No, something
doesn't add up.

58:55.793 --> 58:58.535
He came to my room
last night.

58:58.709 --> 59:01.755
And he was...

59:01.929 --> 59:04.453
He told me he felt like
a weight lifted.

59:04.628 --> 59:06.325
Just the two of you?

59:08.283 --> 59:11.983
This is stupid, but I did
this, like, love spell

59:12.157 --> 59:14.463
and then he came
right into my room and he--

59:16.161 --> 59:17.771
He kissed me.

59:17.945 --> 59:19.294
What?

59:19.468 --> 59:21.209
He kissed me.

59:21.383 --> 59:24.778
He was-- He was already under
the influence of a spell.

59:24.952 --> 59:26.519
This is so jacked up.

59:26.693 --> 59:28.303
I'm sorry, okay?

59:28.477 --> 59:29.391
Okay?

59:33.221 --> 59:35.833
Was all of this
just like some game to you?

59:36.007 --> 59:39.706
What?
All of this work
that we did together

59:39.880 --> 59:43.275
was about building trust,
about building community

59:43.449 --> 59:44.885
and not letting
some stupid crush

59:45.059 --> 59:46.800
get in the way
of everything we've--

59:46.974 --> 59:48.193
I know!

59:48.367 --> 59:50.543
Do you?

59:57.419 --> 59:59.987
I think we should take a break
from magick.

1:00:03.425 --> 1:00:05.471
If we're not gonna use
our power responsibly,

1:00:05.645 --> 1:00:08.169
then we shouldn't
be using it at all.

1:00:14.959 --> 1:00:16.134
Agreed.

1:00:20.399 --> 1:00:21.748
Lily.

1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:19.719
I wanna talk today
about weakness.

1:01:21.416 --> 1:01:23.767
Because when one of us
is weak...

1:01:23.941 --> 1:01:25.769
all of us are weak.

1:01:25.943 --> 1:01:30.991
But how do we alchemize weakness
into sovereign power?

1:01:31.165 --> 1:01:34.081
How do we eliminate
the weakest among us

1:01:34.255 --> 1:01:36.040
so that the strongest
can thrive?

1:01:44.222 --> 1:01:46.006
You all know my son Jacob.

1:01:48.617 --> 1:01:50.402
Come here, son.

1:01:50.576 --> 1:01:51.664
Dad...

1:01:53.405 --> 1:01:54.449
Come here.

1:02:02.283 --> 1:02:04.111
My son lost a friend today.

1:02:05.809 --> 1:02:09.638
No. No, we all face tragedy
every day.

1:02:09.813 --> 1:02:12.293
The question is,
how do we face it?

1:02:19.387 --> 1:02:20.911
It's okay.

1:02:21.085 --> 1:02:22.913
Dad, no.It's okay.

1:02:25.698 --> 1:02:27.221
You're not weak.

1:02:28.266 --> 1:02:29.702
You're not weak.

1:02:34.359 --> 1:02:36.187
He was weak.

1:02:38.711 --> 1:02:39.799
It's okay.

1:02:41.192 --> 1:02:42.541
You're not weak.

1:04:05.929 --> 1:04:07.147
Can't sleep?

1:04:07.321 --> 1:04:08.235
Oh.

1:04:10.890 --> 1:04:11.935
Me neither.

1:04:15.634 --> 1:04:18.855
Lily,
I wanna apologize...

1:04:20.682 --> 1:04:23.468
for being
so tough on you.

1:04:23.642 --> 1:04:26.123
You know, it wasn't
always so easy for me,

1:04:26.297 --> 1:04:28.342
raising three boys
on my own.

1:04:28.516 --> 1:04:32.477
I had to set very strict rules
and keep 'em in line.

1:04:32.651 --> 1:04:37.047
I know that's not how
you and your mom operate...

1:04:37.743 --> 1:04:39.397
I, um...

1:04:41.355 --> 1:04:44.228
I wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

1:04:47.666 --> 1:04:48.580
Thanks.

1:04:50.277 --> 1:04:52.889
I know you were close
to Timmy too.

1:04:56.544 --> 1:04:58.024
Well, I--

1:04:58.198 --> 1:05:00.374
I saw you checking out
the old family crest, huh?

1:05:02.594 --> 1:05:05.989
It's actually pretty cool.
These go back centuries.

1:05:06.163 --> 1:05:08.687
You know, um, snakes
are usually considered

1:05:08.861 --> 1:05:10.558
scary or dangerous,

1:05:10.732 --> 1:05:14.388
but actually in pagan culture,
they were symbols of rebirth.

1:05:15.824 --> 1:05:18.001
Anyway,
it's getting late.

1:05:18.175 --> 1:05:19.263
To be continued.

1:05:33.233 --> 1:05:35.844
Lily? Are you okay?

1:05:36.019 --> 1:05:37.629
Honey.
Honey, what happened?

1:05:40.023 --> 1:05:41.241
We're not safe.What?

1:05:41.415 --> 1:05:42.634
We're not safe here.

1:05:42.808 --> 1:05:43.940
Wait, listen.

1:05:44.114 --> 1:05:46.377
Take a breath.
Tell me what happened.

1:05:46.551 --> 1:05:48.248
He's dangerous.Who?

1:05:48.422 --> 1:05:51.512
Adam. I'm telling you.What? Did something happen?

1:05:53.950 --> 1:05:55.995
Last night, he said...

1:05:56.169 --> 1:05:57.518
And I saw...

1:05:57.692 --> 1:05:59.738
He had a...

1:05:59.912 --> 1:06:02.828
I just really think
we need to go.

1:06:04.569 --> 1:06:07.572
I just really think
we should go.

1:06:07.746 --> 1:06:12.359
Honestly, Lily, you are going
through a lot right now.

1:06:12.533 --> 1:06:14.448
Okay.

1:06:15.710 --> 1:06:16.842
Okay, um...

1:06:19.279 --> 1:06:20.715
Let us go
somewhere new. Huh?

1:06:20.889 --> 1:06:23.892
Let's just take a road trip,
just take a weekend,

1:06:24.067 --> 1:06:27.766
just the two of us,
somewhere cool, somewhere fun.

1:06:27.940 --> 1:06:29.507
That could be good, right?

1:06:32.510 --> 1:06:35.774
We just need to make it
through the funeral.

1:06:35.948 --> 1:06:37.950
Then I'll make it right.

1:06:50.180 --> 1:06:52.443
There's gotta be something here
that proves it.

1:06:56.099 --> 1:06:57.883
Lily?

1:06:58.057 --> 1:06:59.145
You ready?

1:07:46.888 --> 1:07:48.455
Lily, we gotta go.

1:07:50.066 --> 1:07:51.719
What the hell is this?

1:07:54.244 --> 1:07:55.897
Where did you find that?

1:07:56.072 --> 1:07:58.335
You never told me?

1:08:00.163 --> 1:08:01.686
Huh?

1:08:03.427 --> 1:08:04.384
Lily.

1:08:05.907 --> 1:08:06.952
It's complicated.

1:08:07.126 --> 1:08:08.519
No, it's really not.

1:08:08.693 --> 1:08:10.608
It's, like,
a simple conversation

1:08:10.782 --> 1:08:13.219
that should have happened
a long time ago.

1:08:13.393 --> 1:08:14.699
No. You don't--

1:08:14.873 --> 1:08:16.875
Hold on. Hold on. No.

1:08:17.049 --> 1:08:18.790
Don't touch me!

1:08:18.964 --> 1:08:19.965
Oh, God.

1:08:23.055 --> 1:08:24.578
What?

1:08:24.752 --> 1:08:25.884
Say it!

1:08:26.058 --> 1:08:28.060
It wasn't entirely
up to me.

1:08:28.234 --> 1:08:32.108
Oh, really? Who else would
it have been up to, Mom?

1:08:34.849 --> 1:08:37.287
It was your birth mother.

1:08:37.461 --> 1:08:39.767
It was the one condition
that she had,

1:08:39.941 --> 1:08:43.467
that I never reveal to you,
and she's...

1:08:45.556 --> 1:08:48.994
She didn't want you to know
that you were adopted,

1:08:49.168 --> 1:08:51.170
and I made a promise
to her and...

1:08:51.344 --> 1:08:52.432
It was such a...

1:08:53.999 --> 1:08:55.479
God,
it was a complicated...

1:08:55.653 --> 1:08:56.871
Why would she want that?

1:08:57.045 --> 1:08:58.134
'Cause she...

1:09:00.179 --> 1:09:02.790
She had undergone

1:09:02.964 --> 1:09:04.314
some trauma.

1:09:06.577 --> 1:09:10.798
I was assigned to her
at the crisis center here and...

1:09:14.933 --> 1:09:17.718
Baby, I'm so sorry.

1:09:53.711 --> 1:09:55.974
You guys,
I need to talk to you.

1:09:56.148 --> 1:09:57.758
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1:09:57.932 --> 1:10:00.805
Listen to me.
Please.

1:10:02.676 --> 1:10:04.504
There's no one else
I can trust.

1:10:11.990 --> 1:10:13.731
Fine.

1:10:18.257 --> 1:10:19.215
Lily.Don't.

1:10:26.265 --> 1:10:27.745
You all right?

1:11:06.305 --> 1:11:09.395
I need to take her
away from here.

1:11:11.223 --> 1:11:13.269
I need to put her first.

1:11:18.317 --> 1:11:20.363
You guys,
she's not gonna harm anyone.

1:11:20.537 --> 1:11:21.668
She already did.

1:11:21.842 --> 1:11:23.888
She's just going through
some shit.

1:11:24.062 --> 1:11:25.585
Yeah, well, what happened

1:11:25.759 --> 1:11:28.022
to our number one rule
of the craft?

1:11:30.155 --> 1:11:33.419
If a person is a danger
to herself or others,

1:11:33.593 --> 1:11:35.421
they will be bound.

1:11:35.595 --> 1:11:37.989
She used her powers
irresponsibly.

1:11:40.948 --> 1:11:42.210
End of story.

1:11:42.385 --> 1:11:44.648
But, like, are
we any better, though?

1:11:44.822 --> 1:11:47.651
I mean, like,
what we did to Timmy.

1:11:50.044 --> 1:11:52.656
That wasn't consensual
either.

1:11:52.830 --> 1:11:56.616
Well, then maybe
we should bind ourselves too.

1:12:00.925 --> 1:12:03.275
We are bound to each other

1:12:04.842 --> 1:12:06.452
and bound from magick.

1:12:09.673 --> 1:12:12.328
We prevent ourselves
from doing harm.

1:12:18.246 --> 1:12:21.685
We relinquish our powers
from this day forth.

1:12:27.908 --> 1:12:29.823
So mote it be.

1:12:50.496 --> 1:12:51.541
Let's go.

1:12:52.585 --> 1:12:53.586
What?

1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:54.761
You were right.

1:12:56.197 --> 1:12:58.069
I never should've
brought you here.

1:13:01.028 --> 1:13:04.118
But I need you to agree
to one thing.

1:13:04.292 --> 1:13:07.948
Whatever this is,
whatever's happening here...

1:13:11.212 --> 1:13:13.084
I need you to stop it.

1:13:15.478 --> 1:13:16.914
What do you mean?

1:13:17.088 --> 1:13:18.263
I should've told you.

1:13:19.830 --> 1:13:22.528
Not just about
your birth mother, but about...

1:13:24.138 --> 1:13:25.357
About these...

1:13:27.707 --> 1:13:29.927
These powers.

1:13:30.101 --> 1:13:31.842
Whatever you call them,
Lily, they're--

1:13:32.016 --> 1:13:33.539
You knew?

1:13:33.713 --> 1:13:35.454
I'm sorry.

1:13:38.196 --> 1:13:39.415
I was warned...

1:13:41.025 --> 1:13:43.593
that your legacy
was a curse.

1:13:43.767 --> 1:13:45.899
And that the second
they came online,

1:13:46.073 --> 1:13:48.511
I would have to stop them
in their tracks, so Lily--

1:13:51.339 --> 1:13:52.776
Lily, please.

1:13:54.517 --> 1:13:55.431
Honey...

1:13:57.520 --> 1:13:59.173
let me take the burden
for you.

1:14:02.394 --> 1:14:06.659
Let me take your curse
so you don't have to carry it.

1:14:08.487 --> 1:14:12.143
It has been so painful,
you can't imagine...

1:14:13.666 --> 1:14:15.407
to watch you understand that

1:14:15.581 --> 1:14:17.627
you were different
and not know why.

1:14:19.411 --> 1:14:22.022
Now you can see why
your difference...

1:14:23.763 --> 1:14:25.330
is dangerous.

1:14:27.593 --> 1:14:29.595
But I need you to say it
with me, Lily.

1:14:31.858 --> 1:14:33.730
In the name of Manon...

1:14:36.559 --> 1:14:39.083
I give you my power.

1:14:43.435 --> 1:14:45.132
You can trust me.

1:14:47.134 --> 1:14:48.658
I'm your mother.

1:14:52.226 --> 1:14:55.055
My mother would never tell me
my difference is dangerous.

1:15:43.451 --> 1:15:44.627
Guys?

1:15:47.891 --> 1:15:48.761
"He...

1:15:56.334 --> 1:15:57.857
killed...

1:16:02.035 --> 1:16:03.036
me."

1:16:04.168 --> 1:16:05.343
You guys.

1:16:08.999 --> 1:16:10.261
Who is it?

1:16:13.786 --> 1:16:14.657
"T...

1:16:16.572 --> 1:16:17.485
I...

1:16:18.617 --> 1:16:19.531
M...

1:16:20.619 --> 1:16:22.360
M...

1:16:22.534 --> 1:16:23.666
Y."

1:17:02.052 --> 1:17:02.966
Uh-oh.

1:17:04.402 --> 1:17:07.100
Those don't seem
to be working anymore.

1:17:07.274 --> 1:17:08.885
Thanks to
your so-called friends.

1:17:11.017 --> 1:17:13.846
You see, that's the thing
about girls with power, Lily.

1:17:14.020 --> 1:17:16.675
They're always too weak not
to use it against each other.

1:17:23.073 --> 1:17:24.988
What do you want from me?

1:17:26.337 --> 1:17:28.948
That's an excellent
question.

1:17:29.122 --> 1:17:30.820
Oh, you see, Lily....

1:17:33.300 --> 1:17:34.693
I want your power.

1:17:35.999 --> 1:17:37.740
Where's my mother?

1:17:41.004 --> 1:17:42.222
Which one?

1:17:43.571 --> 1:17:44.572
Helen.

1:17:45.965 --> 1:17:48.881
She's tied up
at the moment.

1:17:50.491 --> 1:17:51.841
Your real mom....

1:17:52.015 --> 1:17:55.583
Well, she's tied up too,
in a different way.

1:17:57.107 --> 1:17:59.283
You're a lot like her.

1:17:59.457 --> 1:18:01.589
You know,
she fought it at first,

1:18:01.764 --> 1:18:04.418
but eventually
she gave in.

1:18:04.592 --> 1:18:07.421
You see, Lily, in order
to gain a witch's power,

1:18:07.595 --> 1:18:09.336
she has to give them up
voluntarily.

1:18:09.510 --> 1:18:11.774
So you do have
a choice here.

1:18:14.733 --> 1:18:17.170
We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

1:18:23.786 --> 1:18:25.831
You'll have to kill me first.

1:18:28.921 --> 1:18:29.879
So the easy way.

1:18:54.947 --> 1:18:56.557
You guys came for me.

1:19:02.955 --> 1:19:04.478
There's no I in "sisterhood,"
baby.

1:19:04.652 --> 1:19:06.480
There is definitely an I
in "sisterhood."

1:19:06.654 --> 1:19:08.004
You get my meaning.

1:19:08.178 --> 1:19:10.876
What we were saying was....We're sorry.

1:19:11.050 --> 1:19:13.270
We love you,
and we unbind you, Lily.

1:19:25.021 --> 1:19:26.239
Guys.

1:19:30.200 --> 1:19:32.680
You girls ought to be careful
in the woods at night.

1:19:34.073 --> 1:19:35.553
A lot of weirdos out here.

1:19:38.686 --> 1:19:40.993
We arethe weirdos, mister.

1:20:58.549 --> 1:20:59.463
No!

1:21:06.731 --> 1:21:11.344
You see, Lily,
power is order.

1:21:11.518 --> 1:21:14.304
It belongs in the hands
of those who understand it.

1:21:16.132 --> 1:21:19.048
It's been that way
for thousands of years.

1:21:19.222 --> 1:21:21.050
Timmy's a good example
of that.

1:21:23.530 --> 1:21:27.012
Until you tried to make him
in your own image.

1:21:27.186 --> 1:21:29.101
So then I had to kill him...

1:21:35.586 --> 1:21:37.022
to restore the order.

1:21:38.415 --> 1:21:42.462
Because we are not
in your image.

1:21:42.636 --> 1:21:45.596
We are your rulers and kings.

1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:48.338
The thing is, Lily,

1:21:48.512 --> 1:21:50.079
you got yourself here.

1:21:50.253 --> 1:21:52.646
But you're playing with fire,

1:21:52.820 --> 1:21:54.474
and I'm gonna watch you burn.

1:21:59.392 --> 1:22:00.959
South.

1:22:01.133 --> 1:22:02.004
East.

1:22:03.657 --> 1:22:04.832
North.

1:22:07.183 --> 1:22:08.967
Where do you think
you're going?

1:22:12.623 --> 1:22:13.841
West.

1:22:22.067 --> 1:22:24.548
Air, fire, water, earth.

1:22:24.722 --> 1:22:27.203
Air, fire, water, earth.

1:22:27.377 --> 1:22:29.683
Air, fire, water, earth.

1:22:40.303 --> 1:22:44.655
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire,
fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.

1:23:09.593 --> 1:23:11.116
Lily!

1:23:14.293 --> 1:23:16.295
Now it's your turn to burn.

1:23:49.589 --> 1:23:50.764
Big day.

1:23:52.505 --> 1:23:53.680
Text us after,
okay?

1:23:53.854 --> 1:23:55.117
I will.

1:23:55.291 --> 1:23:57.032
And take pics.

1:23:57.206 --> 1:23:58.424
That I can't promise.

1:24:02.167 --> 1:24:03.255
Hey, girls.

1:24:03.429 --> 1:24:05.127
Hey, Ms. Schechner.Hi.

1:24:05.301 --> 1:24:07.390
How's the warlock dating pool
treatin' ya?

1:24:07.564 --> 1:24:08.652
Are you steering clear?

1:24:08.826 --> 1:24:09.740
Frankie!

1:24:09.914 --> 1:24:11.568
What? It's too soon?

1:24:11.742 --> 1:24:13.135
A little, yeah.

1:24:13.309 --> 1:24:15.267
It's just a joke.

1:24:15.441 --> 1:24:18.488
But, also, not really
because we almost did die.

1:24:18.662 --> 1:24:20.011
We get it.

1:24:20.185 --> 1:24:22.796
All right,
let's hit the road, baby girl.

1:24:22.970 --> 1:24:24.059
Okay.

1:24:26.626 --> 1:24:28.846
Good luck.Thank you.

1:24:29.020 --> 1:24:31.370
Hey, you got this.

1:24:31.544 --> 1:24:33.242
Love you.Love you.

1:24:33.416 --> 1:24:35.418
Love you. - I love you.

1:24:41.815 --> 1:24:43.295
You ready?

1:24:55.264 --> 1:24:56.178
Hi.

1:24:58.354 --> 1:24:59.572
I'm looking for...

1:25:03.750 --> 1:25:05.317
And what is your relation?

1:25:29.994 --> 1:25:31.126
Can I help you?

1:25:33.215 --> 1:25:34.607
My name is Lily.

1:25:36.609 --> 1:25:37.567
And, um...

1:25:43.181 --> 1:25:44.791
I'm your daughter.
