00:02.654 --> 00:05.135
<i>Back in the '80s,
water parks were the peak
of childhood fun.</i>

00:05.309 --> 00:08.356
<i>They were wet, wild,
and incredibly dangerous.</i>

00:08.530 --> 00:09.792
<i>Seriously,
what were we thinking?</i>

00:11.489 --> 00:13.100
Adam, do you have
a moment

00:13.274 --> 00:14.797
to talk about
our Lord and Savior?

00:14.971 --> 00:16.538
Joshin'.

00:16.712 --> 00:19.367
I am here to talk about
something way less urgent

00:19.541 --> 00:21.238
than your holy salvation...
Our local water park.

00:21.412 --> 00:22.761
Riptide Waters?

00:22.935 --> 00:25.329
I'm here gathering signatures
to shut the park down.

00:25.503 --> 00:26.809
Would you care to add
your Johnny Hancock?

00:26.983 --> 00:28.071
Hell no.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.073
Riptide Waters
is a beloved institution.

00:30.247 --> 00:32.597
I spent many a summer
splashing, sunning,

00:32.771 --> 00:34.773
and forcing Adam
down slides

00:34.947 --> 00:36.253
he wasn't legally
tall enough
to go down.

00:36.427 --> 00:38.038
Can't see tears
when you're dripping wet.

00:38.212 --> 00:39.430
Well, your
"beloved institution"

00:39.604 --> 00:41.084
is the reason
I tore my rotator cuff.

00:41.258 --> 00:42.781
How'd you do it?

00:42.955 --> 00:44.609
Were you running against
the lifeguard's orders?

00:44.783 --> 00:47.134
I was merely riding
my favorite slide,
the Atomic Tsunami.

00:47.308 --> 00:48.831
The Atomic Tsunami rules.

00:49.005 --> 00:51.442
I hit a dry spot
in the Funnel Tunnel

00:51.616 --> 00:54.924
and found myself
stuck backwards
in complete darkness.

00:55.098 --> 00:56.708
A mere ribbon of light
to let me know

00:56.882 --> 00:58.536
that I was still
of this earth.

00:58.710 --> 01:01.365
I couldn't figure out the
handle on a porta-potty
once, so I feel ya.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.976
First person to crash into me
was a boy named Oliver.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.717
We had a moment
to introduce ourselves.

01:05.891 --> 01:06.631
Then came the others.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.198
Dear God.

01:08.372 --> 01:09.808
That's what I said,
over and over again,

01:09.982 --> 01:11.941
as teen after slippery teen

01:12.115 --> 01:13.769
slammed into
my contorted body.

01:13.943 --> 01:15.945
So how did you get out and
end up here whining about it?

01:16.119 --> 01:17.816
Finally, the pressure
became too much

01:17.990 --> 01:19.340
and we exploded
down Wizard's Wash.

01:19.514 --> 01:21.951
Alone and terrified,
I also realized

01:22.125 --> 01:25.085
that I swallowed a tremendous
amount of water and Band-Aids.

01:25.259 --> 01:27.478
Alone? You were
there by yourself?

01:27.652 --> 01:29.437
Who I was with or not with
is not the takeaway here.

01:29.611 --> 01:30.873
It's not not the takeaway.

01:31.047 --> 01:32.440
Don't spin this.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.398
I was the one who was
gruesomely injured.

01:34.572 --> 01:35.965
And when I tried
to complain

01:36.139 --> 01:38.968
to the smug and tan teen
manning the slide,

01:39.142 --> 01:40.709
he blew his whistle
sharply at me.

01:40.883 --> 01:42.319
That's Blake.
He's hilarious.

01:42.493 --> 01:45.148
You are intentionally
ignoring the gravity
of this situation.

01:45.322 --> 01:47.194
Yeah, we are,
'cause we're going
to the water park.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.848
Trumpets of revelation!
How could you do that?

01:50.022 --> 01:51.763
Your hilarious story
has reminded me

01:51.937 --> 01:54.201
how awesome
Riptide Waters is.

01:54.375 --> 01:57.508
Ad, get your water
shoes, your nose plug,
and your swim bonnet.

01:57.682 --> 02:00.163
- Chop, chop.
- It's not a swim bonnet.

02:00.337 --> 02:01.947
It just happens to billow
in the back

02:02.122 --> 02:03.993
and also ties
around my neck.

02:04.167 --> 02:05.081
That sure sounds
like a bonnet.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.343
And it doesn't matter.

02:06.517 --> 02:07.997
Because I'm not going
anywhere near that place.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.781
Then who am I supposed to
ride down the slide with,

02:09.955 --> 02:12.044
two-man human-canoe style?

02:12.219 --> 02:14.221
You mean when you sat
on me and used me
as a raft to go faster?

02:14.395 --> 02:16.179
So many cherished screams.

02:16.353 --> 02:17.833
No thanks.

02:18.007 --> 02:20.314
I need to figure out
how to get off
the NYU waitlist

02:20.488 --> 02:22.794
because my guidance counselor
spends all his time
alone in his swim trunks.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.405
If I don't have a healthy
work-life balance,

02:24.579 --> 02:26.058
I am no good to you.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.799
What's the big rush
to go to college?

02:27.973 --> 02:29.453
- You're 15.
- I'm almost 18!

02:29.627 --> 02:30.759
You're my baby brother.

02:30.933 --> 02:32.543
I think I know
better than you
how old you are.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.284
It is surprising when Adam
says his real age.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.591
It's like, "Wha?"

02:36.765 --> 02:39.333
Anyway, someone wanna
- sign this thing?
- Never.

02:39.507 --> 02:43.119
In fact, I'm starting
a counter petition
to keep the park open.

02:43.293 --> 02:44.599
- That's not how it works.
- Out you go!

02:44.773 --> 02:46.296
Ow! That's my good shoulder!

02:46.470 --> 02:48.255
Who's gonna do
my household chores?

02:50.126 --> 02:51.693
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:51.867 --> 02:54.261
<i>♪ But nonetheless,
I feel the need to say</i>

02:57.438 --> 02:59.179
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

02:59.353 --> 03:01.746
<i>♪ But the past keeps getting
clearer every day ♪</i>

03:03.748 --> 03:05.794
<i>It was October 6th,
1980-something,</i>

03:05.968 --> 03:07.404
<i>and my mom and sister
were excited</i>

03:07.578 --> 03:09.711
<i>to plan Erica's wedding.</i>

03:09.885 --> 03:11.191
<i>They just couldn't agree
on the specifics.</i>

03:11.365 --> 03:12.757
<i>Or anything, really.</i>

03:12.931 --> 03:14.498
Okay, let's add
some beautiful marigolds,

03:14.672 --> 03:15.717
or as we,

03:15.891 --> 03:16.892
in the floral industry,

03:17.066 --> 03:18.415
refer to them as

03:18.589 --> 03:20.243
"teardrops from heaven."

03:20.417 --> 03:22.027
I like those.
What do you think, Mom?

03:22.202 --> 03:24.552
I think we,
outside the floral industry,

03:24.726 --> 03:27.076
refer to those as
"crapdrops from Crapville."

03:27.250 --> 03:29.687
Another, uh, visit
to Crapville.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.385
I know what we need.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.387
Opulence, luxury,

03:33.561 --> 03:36.738
and all the orchids
on the Eastern seaboard.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.218
Orchids are pretty
temperamental.

03:38.392 --> 03:39.306
So am I.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.525
Which would you
rather deal with?

03:41.699 --> 03:42.961
Uh, don't I
get a say in this?
I'm the bride.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.573
So? I made the bride.

03:45.747 --> 03:48.576
None of this would be possible
without my flexible pelvis.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.186
Such powerful imagery.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.405
If only my head was like
an Etch A Sketch.

03:52.667 --> 03:53.624
Nope. Still there.

03:53.798 --> 03:54.712
Control your body, Geoff.

03:54.886 --> 03:56.584
And this is my special day.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.063
You don't get to
choose stuff.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.543
I get to choose
all the stuff.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.458
Then why don't you
get married to Geoff?

04:01.632 --> 04:02.894
He should
be so lucky.

04:03.068 --> 04:03.895
I'd be an excellent
life partner

04:04.069 --> 04:05.636
for your young beau.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.377
This won't creep into
my anxiety dreams tonight.

04:07.551 --> 04:08.683
See ya there.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.209
Yo. Erica's special friend.
Move.

04:13.383 --> 04:14.863
- I'm sorry?
- You should be.

04:15.037 --> 04:16.604
You're blocking my eye line.

04:16.778 --> 04:19.128
I can't see what <i>Small Wonder
has to say.</i>

04:19.302 --> 04:20.695
She may be a tiny robot,

04:20.869 --> 04:22.044
but she's big on life advice.

04:22.218 --> 04:23.828
Speaking of which,

04:24.002 --> 04:25.221
Erica and Mrs. G are really
going at it in there.

04:25.395 --> 04:26.309
Should I intervene?

04:26.483 --> 04:27.745
I have a policy

04:27.919 --> 04:29.094
about not getting involved

04:29.269 --> 04:31.488
in anything in any way,

04:31.662 --> 04:33.229
especially when it comes

04:33.403 --> 04:34.578
to mothers and daughters.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.188
That's worked for you?

04:36.363 --> 04:39.104
I'm silently watching TV
with my best friend, aren't I?

04:39.279 --> 04:40.541
We haven't uttered a word

04:40.715 --> 04:42.369
to each other in five hours.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.675
So I'm supposed to just watch
my future bride lose her mind

04:44.849 --> 04:46.198
while I shop
for cummerbunds?

04:46.373 --> 04:48.244
Look who's
the small wonder now.

04:48.418 --> 04:49.376
If you're worried about

04:49.550 --> 04:50.551
how to support your betrothed,

04:50.725 --> 04:51.421
there's one thing you can do.

04:51.595 --> 04:52.901
Marriage class.

04:53.075 --> 04:54.032
You think
that could help us?

04:54.206 --> 04:55.425
It helped me and Dolores.

04:55.599 --> 04:56.992
Now I'm only
slightly terrified

04:57.166 --> 04:58.646
when she says we have to talk.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.256
I live my life
in constant terror!

05:00.430 --> 05:02.519
Then let this be
my gift to you.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.391
A five-pack of sessions

05:04.565 --> 05:07.219
with esteemed
relationship expert, Dr. Carl.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.612
He sounds very good.

05:08.786 --> 05:10.484
He might be the best.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.181
Or the only person
that does this in the area.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.270
The only lesson the boy needs

05:14.444 --> 05:17.273
is to buy a chair,
sit in it, and shut up.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.841
Ugh! I can't believe
- that woman!
- Good news.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.756
I know a way to support you
and for us to grow

05:21.930 --> 05:23.279
even closer as a couple...

05:23.453 --> 05:24.846
Dr. Carl's marriage class.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.674
The doctor part
might not be official,

05:26.848 --> 05:28.589
but he did lock down
a multi-use room

05:28.763 --> 05:30.982
with a nice selection
of teas.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.810
So, do you wanna grow
as a couple over
some Earl Grey?

05:32.984 --> 05:34.769
I have another idea.

05:34.943 --> 05:37.511
You go by yourself,
and you learn how
to not give me

05:37.685 --> 05:40.601
one more thing to do while
I'm fighting with my mother
and planning a wedding.

05:40.775 --> 05:41.776
I'll go by myself.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.734
- I'm sure it's not weird.
- Oh, it will be.

05:43.908 --> 05:45.867
<i>While Erica
had left Geoff high and dry,</i>

05:46.041 --> 05:48.609
<i>the fight over Riptide Waters
raged on.</i>

05:48.783 --> 05:51.002
Why, hello, young lady.
Is your mother home?

05:51.176 --> 05:52.439
Well, aren't you
a big ball of charm.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.266
I am playful, but to be clear,

05:54.441 --> 05:56.268
I am here with a petition
for you to sign.

05:56.443 --> 05:59.010
Stop. Don't sign
that man's dumb thing.

05:59.184 --> 06:00.708
Sign my dumb thing.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.753
Barry Troublemaking Goldberg,
what are you doing?

06:02.927 --> 06:04.668
Just keeping
Riptide Waters open

06:04.842 --> 06:06.583
for future generations
to enjoy.

06:06.757 --> 06:09.238
Every child deserves
water fun

06:09.412 --> 06:10.935
in a barely supervised
atmosphere.

06:11.109 --> 06:14.722
Incorrect. All 50 acres are
an aquatic torture chamber.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.680
Ooh! You know how
Gravity Falls dumps out
into an actual river?

06:16.854 --> 06:18.290
Mm-hmm.

06:18.465 --> 06:19.248
I once hit a trout
who swallowed
my wedding ring.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.032
Exactly.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.513
It's a hazard for child
and odd lady alike.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.472
Yeah, I'm gonna sign neither
and shut the door.

06:27.169 --> 06:29.563
Yes! Your loss is my win.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.565
Plus, I've already gotten
like 700 signatures.

06:31.739 --> 06:34.219
These aren't
real signatures.
"Pete Zapaya"?

06:34.394 --> 06:35.482
He's a romantic
Italian gentleman.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.048
"John A. Signature"?

06:37.222 --> 06:38.398
The entire Signature family
is behind me.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.138
"The Real Charles Barkley"?

06:40.312 --> 06:41.923
He wouldn't sign
his name like that.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.186
I was surprised, too,
but here it is in ink.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.796
I'm not giving up.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.407
I'm gonna knock on
every door in town

06:47.581 --> 06:48.495
until that park
is closed.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.453
Not if I knock
on them first.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.542
- Youthful run!
- Dang it!

06:52.716 --> 06:54.805
<i>As Barry
and Mr. Glascott
were hitting the streets,</i>

06:54.979 --> 06:56.938
<i>Geoff was returning home
with good news.</i>

06:57.112 --> 06:59.506
I did it. I went to
Dr. Carl's marriage class
all by myself.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.464
You're coming in
with a lot of energy
I can't match,

07:01.638 --> 07:02.770
so get it all out now.

07:02.944 --> 07:04.380
After the super awkward
first ten minutes

07:04.554 --> 07:05.816
convincing them
you were real,

07:05.990 --> 07:07.514
I gained
a greater understanding

07:07.688 --> 07:08.689
of how to be a supportive
partner to you.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.125
And I'm all for
whatever you just said,

07:10.299 --> 07:11.996
but sorry,

07:12.170 --> 07:14.172
my mom's trying on
her dress for the wedding,
and I'm worried.

07:14.346 --> 07:15.957
Don't. All eyes
will be on you.

07:16.131 --> 07:18.046
<i>♪ Here comes the mom</i>

07:18.220 --> 07:20.004
<i>♪ Here comes the mom ♪</i>

07:20.178 --> 07:22.703
What do you think?

07:22.877 --> 07:25.619
Wow. Wow. Wow.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.577
Don't worry. I know
it seems tight
in through here,

07:27.751 --> 07:28.926
but it's still
roomy enough
at the bottom

07:29.100 --> 07:30.493
for me to do
my dance solo.

07:32.147 --> 07:32.974
It's white.

07:33.148 --> 07:35.150
It is egg cream.

07:35.324 --> 07:37.239
It's clearly a bridal gown.

07:37.413 --> 07:39.459
Do you want me
to coordinate
with you or not?

07:39.633 --> 07:41.461
We're practically
twin sisters,

07:41.635 --> 07:43.245
or so I expect to hear.

07:43.419 --> 07:44.986
It's supposed to be my day.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.944
And it will be. Mostly.

07:47.118 --> 07:49.904
You are unbelievable.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.993
<i>In that moment,
Geoff had a choice.</i>

07:52.167 --> 07:53.821
<i>Do nothing
like my dad suggested,</i>

07:53.995 --> 07:55.692
<i>or stand up
and support his wife</i>

07:55.866 --> 07:57.607
<i>like he learned
from Dr. Carl.</i>

07:57.781 --> 08:00.218
Mrs. Goldberg, I have to say
something you need to hear.

08:00.392 --> 08:01.916
Oh, my.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.135
Are you gathering yourself
right now, Geoffrey?

08:05.963 --> 08:07.487
Your spine doesn't have
that usual candy cane shape.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.663
I love your daughter,

08:09.837 --> 08:12.056
and I want this wedding
to be a positive experience
for her,

08:12.230 --> 08:16.278
so I am respectfully
asking you
to take a step back.

08:20.717 --> 08:21.718
I see.

08:24.939 --> 08:26.462
Message received.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.333
Uh... Okay.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.074
Great.
That went well.

08:30.988 --> 08:31.989
What went well?

08:32.163 --> 08:33.600
Your loving
and supportive fiance

08:33.774 --> 08:35.558
just asked your mother
to take a step back.

08:35.732 --> 08:36.994
A step back?

08:37.168 --> 08:38.822
As in backwards?

08:38.996 --> 08:40.476
As in away
from the wedding?

08:40.650 --> 08:42.391
Why is your tone
so haunting and ominous?

08:42.565 --> 08:43.740
It went well.
She even said, "I see."

08:43.914 --> 08:45.220
This is bad.

08:45.394 --> 08:46.874
This is really bad.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.484
"I see." She saw.

08:48.658 --> 08:50.921
Even if she says she saw,
she never sees.

08:51.095 --> 08:52.227
- I see.
- Do you?

08:52.401 --> 08:54.664
I see that I saw differently
that she said she saw.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.884
- What?
- I don't know!

08:57.058 --> 08:57.972
Erica, it has come
to my attention

08:58.146 --> 08:59.495
that your fiance
hates me

08:59.669 --> 09:00.844
and wants nothing more
to do with me.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.324
That's not what I said.

09:02.498 --> 09:04.152
I've been kicked out
of your lives forever.

09:04.326 --> 09:06.676
An old bottle of Mountain Dew
hucked out the window

09:06.850 --> 09:09.200
and left to yellow and fade
on the highway of life.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.725
I love Mountain Dew.
It's not just a beverage,
it's a lifestyle.

09:11.899 --> 09:14.379
Here are holiday, birthday,
and get-well cards

09:14.554 --> 09:16.904
for my yet-to-be-conceived
grandchildren.

09:17.078 --> 09:19.776
Make sure they know my name,
my face, and my story of loss.

09:21.778 --> 09:23.911
If you need me,
I will be crying
in my room for eternity.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.917
The hell, dude?

09:30.091 --> 09:32.093
Dr. Carl would say
find the positive here.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.660
With your mother
less involved,

09:33.834 --> 09:35.183
now we can
plan the wedding
that you want.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.401
I guess that would be nice.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.055
There we go. "Nice."

09:38.229 --> 09:39.622
"Awesome's" slightly
less exciting cousin.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.145
Okay, let's do it.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.191
Wedding stuff.

09:43.365 --> 09:44.540
I can't believe
I was worried

09:44.714 --> 09:46.716
just 'cause Dr. Carl
wears a leather sun hat.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.979
<i>As Geoff
was heeding the lessons
of his new therapist,</i>

09:49.153 --> 09:51.634
<i>I was seeking the guidance
of my favorite counselor.</i>

09:51.808 --> 09:52.983
Mr. Glascott,
you have a minute?

09:53.157 --> 09:54.681
Uh, sure. Let me
just put these away.

09:54.855 --> 09:57.118
Ow. Oh. Oh.

09:57.292 --> 09:58.685
Ow! King of kings!

09:59.424 --> 10:00.991
My buttocks.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.385
I know about your shoulder,
but what happened to your...

10:03.559 --> 10:04.908
Delicate rump?

10:05.082 --> 10:07.650
It's a delayed injury
from the water slide.

10:07.824 --> 10:09.913
I woke up this a.m.
with a purpled haunch.

10:10.087 --> 10:12.002
I'm just gonna start.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.744
I need to juice up
my high school resume
if I'm gonna get into NYU.

10:14.918 --> 10:16.572
Getting involved in a cause

10:16.746 --> 10:18.574
or a charity
always looks good.

10:18.748 --> 10:22.447
And right now,
there's a lone, broken man
fighting the good fight,

10:22.622 --> 10:25.015
and he sure
could use some help
collecting signatures.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.713
That's a great idea.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.628
I'll help Barry
save the water park.

10:28.802 --> 10:29.977
I'm talking about me.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.675
But Barry's on the side
of an adored local business.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.155
You're like
the mean, old developer

10:34.329 --> 10:35.635
trying to close down
the community center.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.201
Developer?

10:37.375 --> 10:39.943
I can't even afford
two pieces of bread.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.598
Every sandwich I make
is open-faced.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.035
I say it's bruschetta,
but it is not.

10:45.209 --> 10:46.384
Have you considered
folding the bread?

10:46.558 --> 10:47.864
Just go do your thing!

10:49.736 --> 10:51.215
Aw, my fundament.

10:53.087 --> 10:55.306
Barry! I'm helping you
save Riptide Waters!

10:55.480 --> 10:57.700
Oh, finally!

10:57.874 --> 11:00.747
My hand's cramping up
from copying all these names
out of the phone book.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.487
But we won't need
fake signatures.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.793
We need to
paint a picture

11:03.967 --> 11:05.665
of what this park
really means to people.

11:05.839 --> 11:08.537
Like a mural
of different faces
on a downtown wall?

11:08.711 --> 11:10.931
No, Barry.
- We're making a movie.
- Better.

11:11.105 --> 11:13.803
And I only wasted
three days of college on this.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.983
<i>Geoff and Erica
had cut my mom
out of the wedding planning</i>

11:20.157 --> 11:21.550
<i>and were hoping the rest
would be a piece of cake.</i>

11:21.724 --> 11:23.117
Mmm. What do you think?

11:23.291 --> 11:24.640
- I don't know.
- It's rich.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.294
Moist. Chocolatey.

11:26.468 --> 11:27.556
But is it chocolatey enough?

11:27.730 --> 11:28.992
It's called
"Death By Chocolate," so...

11:29.166 --> 11:30.907
So, it's too chocolatey?

11:31.081 --> 11:32.430
What if a dog
gets ahold of it?

11:32.604 --> 11:33.823
How many dogs
are gonna be
at our wedding?

11:33.997 --> 11:35.085
What if the caterers
are blind?

11:35.259 --> 11:36.434
- All of them?
- It could happen.

11:36.608 --> 11:38.045
How many seeing eye dogs
have to die

11:38.219 --> 11:39.437
for our one day
of happiness, Geoff?

11:39.611 --> 11:40.961
Mine's spongy.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.092
Why are you here again?

11:42.266 --> 11:44.268
It's a cake tasting.
Need I explain?

11:44.442 --> 11:46.270
- I can't do this.
- Babe, it shouldn't
be this hard.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.533
It wouldn't be
if you hadn't fired my mom.

11:48.708 --> 11:49.665
She was making you
miserable.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.928
Not as miserable
as I am right now.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.495
Tied in knots
about cakes

11:53.669 --> 11:55.410
and your total indifference
about dogs.

11:55.584 --> 11:56.324
I-I can't do this.

11:58.152 --> 11:59.501
I told you so.

11:59.675 --> 12:02.504
I was gonna say, "I'm not
gonna say I told you so,"

12:02.678 --> 12:04.724
but this buttercream
is making me
a lot less sassy.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.116
You're a wonderful resource.

12:06.290 --> 12:07.727
It's mothers and daughters.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.990
You're not gonna understand,
and you never will.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.600
But Dr. Carl said...

12:11.774 --> 12:14.037
Dr. Carl doesn't sound
like a real doctor.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.430
He went to the
medical school of life.

12:15.604 --> 12:16.518
The road was his teacher,

12:16.692 --> 12:17.649
and he says
they still keep in touch.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.913
Just stay out of it.

12:20.087 --> 12:22.437
Fifty years of letting it
silently wash over you,
then you die.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.613
That's the goal.

12:24.787 --> 12:25.570
<i>As Geoff's
wedding plans
were falling apart,</i>

12:25.745 --> 12:28.138
<i>Barry and I
got the JTP together</i>

12:28.312 --> 12:30.924
<i>to film a heartfelt
testimonial for our
favorite water park.</i>

12:31.098 --> 12:33.317
What's your favorite moment
at Riptide Waters?

12:33.491 --> 12:35.363
I guess when I lost my trunks
on the water slide.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.452
When I was made a junior
lifeguard at Full Moon Lagoon.

12:37.626 --> 12:38.888
For me, it's the wave pool.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.760
So, I'm just flying down
this slide a-and whoop!

12:40.934 --> 12:42.674
There goes my shorts.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.851
The girls gave me
a lot of attention
when I had that whistle.

12:45.025 --> 12:46.678
Especially Stacy Leiberman.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.377
One time,
I was under the water
for eight whole minutes.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.683
At least...
At least I think it was eight.

12:51.858 --> 12:54.164
I-I've forgotten a lot
about that day.

12:54.338 --> 12:56.036
The trunks are the only thing
really slowing you down
when you're on the slide,

12:56.210 --> 12:57.515
so I just kept going
faster and faster.

12:57.689 --> 13:00.518
You remember when Stacy
"went missing" in the Lagoon

13:00.692 --> 13:02.782
and people were going crazy
and the park manager was like,

13:02.956 --> 13:04.305
"You can swim, right?
Get in there."

13:04.479 --> 13:06.481
I do remember sinking
to the bottom

13:06.655 --> 13:09.658
and feeling really at peace.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.616
And I just came shooting
out of that slide,

13:11.791 --> 13:13.880
uh, skipped across the pool
like a stone across a lake.

13:14.054 --> 13:17.579
I dove into that lagoon again
and again looking for Stacy,

13:17.753 --> 13:19.624
but I couldn't...
I-I-I couldn't find her.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.757
And then I saw my grandma,

13:21.931 --> 13:24.455
a-and she had
this bright, warm light

13:24.629 --> 13:28.024
coming from behind her,
but also from within.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.765
I looked around for my suit,
but it was gone.

13:29.939 --> 13:30.897
It doesn't make any sense,

13:31.071 --> 13:32.681
but deep down,
I know the park took it.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.162
At the end of the day,
the manager said
it was all a joke.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.294
That Stacy was never
even there, and...

13:37.468 --> 13:38.774
And I believed him.

13:38.948 --> 13:40.254
I was just a boy.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.778
I could smell
my grandma's perfume.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.346
Although, it might have been
the aftershave

13:45.520 --> 13:47.304
of the lifeguard
that was resuscitating me.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.393
Then I noticed
everyone looking at me.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.787
So many judging eyes.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.658
I-I lied to myself
and embraced it.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.790
I didn't want to,
but I had to.

13:54.964 --> 13:55.878
I had to be Naked Rob.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.401
I never saw Stacy again.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.099
Did I die?

13:59.273 --> 14:00.404
And cut, I guess?

14:01.492 --> 14:03.581
Gentlemen, well done.

14:03.755 --> 14:05.409
Your boring stories
are gonna save this place.

14:05.583 --> 14:06.846
Maybe I'm not Naked Rob.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.499
Maybe I'm just a boy
who lost his suit.

14:08.673 --> 14:12.068
There's a darkness
in the corner of my soul.

14:12.242 --> 14:14.201
Did I bring something
back with me?

14:14.375 --> 14:15.898
Maybe we shouldn't be trying
to keep this place open.

14:16.072 --> 14:17.160
<i>As Barry's dreams</i>

14:17.334 --> 14:18.727
<i>of keeping the park
open faded,</i>

14:18.901 --> 14:20.772
<i>Geoff fought to keep
their wedding planning</i>

14:20.947 --> 14:22.383
<i>from turning into
a total nightmare.</i>

14:22.557 --> 14:23.601
Thank you both
for coming.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.516
Uh, if this is
your apology bouquet

14:25.690 --> 14:27.823
for balling up your hand
and punching me in the heart,

14:27.997 --> 14:29.825
it is vastly too small.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.914
I can't sit back
and watch you two
tear each other apart,

14:32.088 --> 14:33.611
so I came up
with a solution.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.744
From now on,
a totally neutral
third party

14:35.918 --> 14:37.615
will be making
all of our decisions,

14:37.789 --> 14:38.747
and her name is Penny.

14:38.921 --> 14:39.835
She's gonna decide
everything.

14:40.009 --> 14:41.532
A coin flip?

14:41.706 --> 14:43.534
What if it flips
to the side
I don't want?

14:43.708 --> 14:44.796
You haven't thought
this through, Geoff.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.973
Studies show that people
who flip a coin

14:47.147 --> 14:48.844
are more likely to follow
through with their decisions

14:49.018 --> 14:50.846
and report higher
overall happiness.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.196
My podiatrist's nephew
flipped a penny

14:53.370 --> 14:55.242
right down his throat
one time.

14:55.416 --> 14:58.462
It lodged in his intestines
and gave him copper poisoning.

14:58.636 --> 15:01.465
Doctors had to remove
his intestinal tract

15:01.639 --> 15:04.816
and hook his stomach directly
to his home's sewer pipe.

15:04.991 --> 15:08.081
Now he lives and works
in the bathroom
as telemarketer.

15:08.255 --> 15:10.997
His hours are as flexible
as his discharge hose.

15:11.171 --> 15:13.129
None of that ever happened
to a human person,

15:13.303 --> 15:14.914
but she does have a point.

15:15.088 --> 15:16.567
I don't want to leave things
up to chance.

15:16.741 --> 15:18.743
This is a simple
and elegant solution.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.963
Back me up here,
Mrs. Kremp.

15:21.137 --> 15:23.444
You're a sweet boy,
but I-I don't want to weigh in
on anything around here.

15:23.618 --> 15:24.227
Don't marry in.

15:24.401 --> 15:25.750
Let me demonstrate.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.013
Heads, we go with marigolds.
Tails, we don't.

15:28.753 --> 15:29.624
Oh, jillickers!
My cornea!

15:29.798 --> 15:31.321
I'm so sorry.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.845
I have a living scriptures
performance tonight!

15:34.020 --> 15:35.238
Did you happen to see
where it landed?

15:35.412 --> 15:36.979
The only thing I can see
is a blurry doofus

15:37.153 --> 15:38.459
who doesn't know
how to flip a darn penny.

15:38.633 --> 15:41.070
Now I have to go rinse out
my eyeball in the sink.

15:41.244 --> 15:42.898
So it's settled.
Orchids it is.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.813
No. I want marigolds.

15:44.987 --> 15:48.251
Erica, you are
my whole heart
and my firstborn,

15:48.425 --> 15:50.036
but you have
for brains.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.211
Enough!

15:51.385 --> 15:53.082
Maybe the penny
was a bad idea,

15:53.256 --> 15:54.954
but all you've been
doing is making
each other miserable.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.043
I'm really excited
for our wedding,

15:57.217 --> 15:58.783
but if you two
can't figure out
a way to get along,

15:58.958 --> 16:00.002
then maybe we just
shouldn't have one.

16:06.356 --> 16:07.618
I don't know.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.707
It feels a little puffy.
Can either of you tell?

16:09.881 --> 16:10.970
Looks the same way
it always does.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.105
<i>As Geoff's
attempt at peace
blew up in his face,</i>

16:16.279 --> 16:18.629
<i>the water park's chances
at staying open
was fizzling out.</i>

16:18.803 --> 16:21.154
Mr. Glascott, with your
harrowing testimony,

16:21.328 --> 16:22.677
and the signatures
from the concerned community,

16:22.851 --> 16:23.852
you make quite a case.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.593
If I can keep one person

16:25.767 --> 16:28.291
from being pummeled
by human missiles,
it was worth it.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.032
Stop the proceedings!

16:30.206 --> 16:31.512
I have something to show

16:31.686 --> 16:34.210
the honorable
Safety Board monsignors.

16:34.384 --> 16:36.038
Stupid democracy.

16:36.212 --> 16:38.649
The name of Riptide Waters
amusement park

16:38.823 --> 16:40.173
has been besmirched.

16:40.347 --> 16:41.870
Okay, this young man
obviously stumbled

16:42.044 --> 16:44.307
into using "besmirched"
correctly.

16:44.481 --> 16:47.136
On this video,
you will find testimonials

16:47.310 --> 16:50.444
un-smirching the heretofore
re-smirched virtues

16:50.618 --> 16:51.619
of Riptide Waters.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.535
<i>♪</i>

16:54.709 --> 16:56.363
Riptide Waters rules!

16:56.537 --> 16:59.105
Rules! Rules! Rules!

16:59.279 --> 17:00.149
Memories!

17:00.323 --> 17:01.498
Keee-yah!

17:01.672 --> 17:03.109
Splashing!

17:03.283 --> 17:04.458
Gravity, gravity, gravity.

17:04.632 --> 17:06.068
Chlorine!

17:06.242 --> 17:07.591
Shoes...

17:08.375 --> 17:09.376
Not mandatory.

17:11.421 --> 17:12.944
Riptide Waters rules!

17:14.511 --> 17:16.774
Water park saved.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.428
It was not.

17:18.602 --> 17:20.778
It is our opinion
that Riptide Waters
be shut down

17:20.952 --> 17:21.866
at close of business
tomorrow.

17:23.694 --> 17:26.219
We lost? How?

17:26.393 --> 17:28.830
I think Mr. Glascott made
a far more coherent case.

17:29.004 --> 17:31.615
But on the bright side,
the NYU admissions department

17:31.789 --> 17:33.443
should really appreciate
my attempt at activism.

17:33.617 --> 17:35.576
NYU?

17:35.750 --> 17:37.447
Is that the only reason
you did this?

17:37.621 --> 17:39.536
Bar, I'll miss
Riptide Waters, too,

17:39.710 --> 17:41.321
but sometimes,
you have to move on.

17:41.495 --> 17:42.974
Like you going off
to college.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.063
What does that
have to do with this?

17:44.237 --> 17:45.803
Don't you get it?

17:45.977 --> 17:48.719
All those special times
are behind us.

17:48.893 --> 17:50.895
Not just the water park.
Our whole childhood.

17:52.593 --> 17:53.637
Even worse,
I'm the only one
who cares.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.688
<i>After losing it
on my mom and my sister,</i>

18:00.862 --> 18:03.604
<i>Geoff went to see
the only person
who'd listen... Dr. Carl.</i>

18:03.778 --> 18:06.433
Geofferoni! Did you
finally bring your
mysterious better half?

18:06.607 --> 18:08.913
- No. It's just me again.
- That's okay, <i>amigo.</i>

18:09.088 --> 18:11.307
Dr. Carl is happy to work
with the clay he has.

18:11.481 --> 18:12.395
Ooh! I hear footsteps.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.745
Hey. Sorry I'm tardy.

18:14.919 --> 18:17.183
Dolores is in the car
applying eyeliner.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.662
She just sent me in
to let everyone know

18:18.836 --> 18:20.403
that I'm an insensitive man
who doesn't understand

18:20.577 --> 18:21.578
that "you look tired"

18:21.752 --> 18:23.058
is not a helpful
comment, so...

18:24.451 --> 18:26.148
Erica? You're here?

18:26.322 --> 18:27.932
And your parents are,
too, for some reason?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.325
My dad thought
it would be a good idea

18:29.499 --> 18:30.370
for us to talk it out
with a professional.

18:30.544 --> 18:32.067
Or this guy, I guess.

18:32.241 --> 18:34.156
Mr. G, you actually
did something?

18:34.330 --> 18:36.419
Maybe I realized
that you're right.

18:36.593 --> 18:37.855
You can't always sit
on the sidelines.

18:38.029 --> 18:39.727
This is so exciting.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.120
There are so many
things we can... Bup-bup-bup!

18:41.294 --> 18:42.730
Not you.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.427
This is about the girl
and her mother.

18:44.601 --> 18:45.907
Apparently,
I'm a bit of a handful.

18:46.081 --> 18:47.952
We both are.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.346
Geoff, I'm sorry that
I didn't make it
here until now.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.174
I'm incredibly lucky
to have someone

18:52.348 --> 18:53.436
who cares so much
about my happiness.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.221
- Aww.
- Now beat it.

18:55.395 --> 18:57.223
The couple who really
needs counseling
is me and this one.

18:57.397 --> 18:59.399
Let's go.

18:59.573 --> 19:03.098
So, Geoff tells me
there's been a little
conflict lately.

19:03.272 --> 19:06.971
I admit, sometimes,
I am very aggressive
in my style, taste, and tone,

19:07.146 --> 19:09.713
but that's only because
I want the perfect wedding
for my baby.

19:09.887 --> 19:12.020
The perfect wedding
would be if we could
plan it together.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.849
I need you,
but I also need a voice.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.720
I suppose
that makes sense.

19:16.894 --> 19:18.113
And I suppose
the road to healing

19:18.287 --> 19:20.159
is just around
the next bend.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.639
Let's go there together,
shall we?

19:22.813 --> 19:25.207
I'm in. Hearing
other people's problems

19:25.381 --> 19:27.514
reminds me that
mine aren't so big.

19:27.688 --> 19:29.994
<i>While my mom
and Erica were finally
sorting out their issues,</i>

19:30.169 --> 19:32.649
<i>Barry was having one last day
at Riptide Waters.</i>

19:32.823 --> 19:36.044
Whoa!
Why the long line?

19:36.218 --> 19:39.395
Apparently, some kid
with prescription swim goggles
is too afraid to go down.

19:39.569 --> 19:40.266
Adam?

19:41.876 --> 19:43.921
Adam! Let me through!

19:44.095 --> 19:46.315
I'm his brother,
future doctor,

19:46.489 --> 19:48.056
and childhood hero!

19:48.230 --> 19:49.753
Barry, what are you
doing here?

19:49.927 --> 19:51.538
I heard you were
scared to go down.

19:51.712 --> 19:53.061
Climb in my arms,

19:53.235 --> 19:54.715
and I'll carry you past
your peers like a wet baby.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.543
It's not fear.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.719
I got up here and started
thinking about what you said.

19:58.893 --> 20:02.549
You're right.
Our childhood
is slipping away.

20:02.723 --> 20:05.291
It's crazy, but the moment
I go down this slide,

20:05.465 --> 20:06.466
it's all over.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.945
I've been thinking
about it, too,

20:08.119 --> 20:10.600
and yeah, we're never
getting those times back.

20:10.774 --> 20:13.081
- Now you're giving up, too?
- No. It's just...

20:14.343 --> 20:16.867
Maybe we should stop
looking back

20:17.041 --> 20:19.087
and start looking forward.

20:19.261 --> 20:20.480
So we should make
new memories together?

20:20.654 --> 20:22.525
Damn right.

20:22.699 --> 20:26.007
No matter where
we are in the world
or how old we get,

20:26.181 --> 20:28.966
or how erotically demanding
my supermodel wife is,

20:29.140 --> 20:30.490
I'll always make time for you.

20:30.664 --> 20:32.056
Me, too.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.582
So... One last trip
down the Atomic Tsunami?

20:35.756 --> 20:36.539
Human canoe-style?

20:36.713 --> 20:38.149
Is there any other way?

20:38.324 --> 20:40.804
I'm asking.
Is there any other way?

20:40.978 --> 20:43.285
<i>That's the thing
about memories.</i>

20:43.459 --> 20:45.200
<i>Whether cherishing ones
from the past</i>

20:45.374 --> 20:47.376
<i>or planning new ones
for the future,</i>

20:47.550 --> 20:49.770
<i>when we share them
with the people we love,</i>

20:49.944 --> 20:51.250
<i>life gets a little rosier.</i>

20:55.341 --> 20:57.778
Your colorful sweaters
have taken a confusing turn.

20:57.952 --> 20:58.996
Oh, thank you.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.476
I do
look amazing.

21:00.650 --> 21:01.303
I didn't say that.

21:01.477 --> 21:02.783
Great news.

21:02.957 --> 21:04.219
My magic show was perfect!

21:04.393 --> 21:05.829
Only two pigeons
didn't make it.

21:06.003 --> 21:07.178
Adam, help me to the door.

21:07.353 --> 21:08.397
My heels keep catching
on the fabric.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.138
Oh, good.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.227
My mom's going to school
as Madonna today.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.142
Pish-posh.

21:14.316 --> 21:14.795
Your mother's
wearing a wedding
gown to school.

21:14.969 --> 21:15.970
Get over yourself.

21:16.144 --> 21:17.014
Ha!
You're marrying Mom.

21:17.188 --> 21:18.407
I'm surprised

21:18.581 --> 21:19.843
the state's
allowing this,

21:20.017 --> 21:21.236
but I knew
this day would come.

21:21.410 --> 21:22.193
Mazel tov,
you two.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.849
Ohh, no.
