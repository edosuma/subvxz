WEBVTT

00:11.011 --> 00:12.403
It's gone.

00:12.447 --> 00:15.058
DIANE [over phone]:
Martha? What's gone?

00:15.102 --> 00:17.060
[crying]:
They tore it down. It's gone.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.888
Everything is gone.

00:18.931 --> 00:20.498
-Your restaurant?
-Yes.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.979
They can't do that-- the judge
enjoined the demolition.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.982
Well, someone did it,
because it's not here.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.462
â™ª

00:31.379 --> 00:34.425
You screwed up, Mr. Canning.

00:34.469 --> 00:36.427
Mrs. Lockhart. Hello.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.516
-How did I screw up?
-You thought you were going up

00:38.560 --> 00:40.953
against some small
pro bono defendant,

00:40.997 --> 00:43.652
but I've been bankrolled
by STR Laurie

00:43.695 --> 00:45.915
to go after cases
that interest me,

00:45.958 --> 00:47.569
and this one
really interests me.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.527
You seem angry, Diane.

00:49.571 --> 00:51.094
See you in court.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.400
DIANE:
Jay,

00:52.443 --> 00:54.228
I need photos of the site

00:54.271 --> 00:56.534
and interviews
with the construction foreman.

00:56.578 --> 01:00.408
We need to nail down who gavethe go-ahead to the bulldozers.

01:00.451 --> 01:03.150
They'll probably argue that
it was all a miscommunication

01:03.193 --> 01:06.327
between new Orchard corporate
and the, uh, contractors.

01:06.370 --> 01:08.242
So we need to get it on record.

01:08.285 --> 01:09.634
You'll probably have
the same problem

01:09.678 --> 01:11.245
with the Rare Orchard CEO.

01:11.288 --> 01:12.507
They just made that easier.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.248
It's no longer
about eminent domain,

01:14.291 --> 01:16.119
it's about unlawful seizure.

01:16.163 --> 01:18.991
-So we don't have to depose him.-I'll pull the injunction order.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.384
Thanks, Jay.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.561
What the fuck?

01:23.605 --> 01:25.563
Tell Dad if he wants
to come berate me,

01:25.607 --> 01:28.653
do it himself, don't sendhis Democratic Committee lapdog.

01:28.697 --> 01:30.177
-Democratic Committee...
-Every time

01:30.220 --> 01:33.136
I even talk to a Republican,
Dad is crawling up my ass.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.355
-What Republican...
-I am not a Republican,

01:34.398 --> 01:35.660
and I'm not
gonna vote Republican,

01:35.704 --> 01:37.532
but I might fall in love
with a Republican

01:37.575 --> 01:39.186
and have
little Republican children.

01:39.229 --> 01:41.144
-What Republican are you...
-No, no, no, no.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.711
You just tell Dad
to fuck off, okay?

01:42.754 --> 01:44.626
-And you fuck off, too.
-Frank.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.671
-We're ready for you.
-Good.

01:47.672 --> 01:49.587
So nice seeing you, Marissa.

01:52.024 --> 01:53.678
I thought you said Frank Landauwas here for me.

01:53.722 --> 01:55.506
No. I said Frank Landau is here.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.682
-Fuck.
-LANDAU: I know
you've heard it before--

01:57.726 --> 02:00.294
this is the most important
election of our lifetime--

02:00.337 --> 02:03.035
but... this is
the most important election

02:03.079 --> 02:06.169
-of our lifetime.-Should we get Diane in on this?

02:06.213 --> 02:08.650
-No, I'd rather keep it
just us for a minute.
-Why?

02:08.693 --> 02:12.349
DNC is looking to reengagethe African American community.

02:12.393 --> 02:14.046
-Really?
-The presidential election

02:14.090 --> 02:16.527
comes down to Florida,
Michigan, North Carolina,

02:16.571 --> 02:18.747
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin,

02:18.790 --> 02:21.315
all of which have huge
African American electorate.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.012
We don't capitalize on that,

02:23.055 --> 02:25.057
we don't take back
the White House.

02:25.101 --> 02:27.190
-Those are the facts.
-What do you need from us?

02:27.234 --> 02:28.626
A strategy for reengagement.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.759
We want hearts, not just votes.

02:30.802 --> 02:34.284
An exclamation mark agendathat gets black voters energized

02:34.328 --> 02:37.113
and turning out
at '08 levels or better.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.246
No, this is a campaign issue.

02:39.289 --> 02:40.508
You need PR people.

02:40.551 --> 02:42.162
Why-why come to us?

02:42.205 --> 02:44.468
One, you're
an African American firm.

02:44.512 --> 02:47.210
Two, we've workedwith you before on impeachment.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.559
You fired us before
on impeachment.

02:48.603 --> 02:49.734
No, we fired you.

02:49.778 --> 02:52.215
Yes. Now I remember.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.695
LANDAU:
No hard feelings.

02:53.738 --> 02:56.219
And three, we need
attorney-client privilege.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.700
The risk of a leak at a PR firmis just too high.

02:58.743 --> 03:01.093
So, what do you say?

03:04.271 --> 03:07.056
-Damn it!
-I just told our top client
to fuck off.

03:07.099 --> 03:09.232
Whatever you're dealing with
can't be worse.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.191
-I can't find
an injunction order.
-On what case?

03:11.234 --> 03:13.149
Tecades v. Rare Orchard.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.543
-When was it?
-Three days ago.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.109
Maybe it wasn't entered
into our system yet.

03:17.153 --> 03:18.763
I checked
the courthouse system, too.

03:18.807 --> 03:21.070
-You probably just...
-[computer beeps]

03:21.113 --> 03:22.332
It's not there.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.378
-Thanks.
-Maybe it's
under a different name.

03:24.421 --> 03:26.423
Did you try the docket number?

03:29.426 --> 03:31.167
-[beeps]
-Whoa.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.300
-What?
-It says there's no case.

03:33.343 --> 03:35.171
No Tecades v. Rare Orchard.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.390
How is that possible?

03:36.433 --> 03:37.739
-I don't think it is.
-ADRIAN: Jay.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.567
I need you
in the conference room.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.786
-Why? What's wrong?
-Nah, nothing's wrong.

03:41.830 --> 03:44.441
We just need you inthe conference room. All right?

03:44.485 --> 03:46.400
Please don't tell me that.

03:46.443 --> 03:49.272
Lucca. I need you upstairs
in the conference room.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.708
Oh, uh, what's wrong?

03:50.752 --> 03:52.275
Nothing's wrong.

03:52.319 --> 03:54.277
Why does everybody think
something's wrong?

03:54.321 --> 03:55.670
Just... just...

03:55.713 --> 03:57.367
[door closes]

03:57.411 --> 04:00.109
Uh, Bianca, I have to go.

04:00.152 --> 04:02.372
No, it's just work.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.548
Because I work.

04:04.592 --> 04:07.769
Because I'm notindependently wealthy like you.

04:07.812 --> 04:10.293
I don't always say that.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.730
[chuckles]:Okay. Okay, I'm hanging up now.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.428
Because I am.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.560
Because my boss needs me.

04:16.604 --> 04:18.606
Okay, I'm going now.
Seriously.

04:18.649 --> 04:19.781
No. Bye.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.173
Goodbye. Bye.

04:27.658 --> 04:30.444
Did you check
the courthouse system?

04:30.487 --> 04:32.315
JAY:
Theirs and ours. No case.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.665
No injunction.
No docket number.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.625
Well, there was
an injunction, right?

04:37.668 --> 04:39.844
-Yes. Three days ago.
It was in our system.
-You saw it?

04:39.888 --> 04:41.803
-Yes.
-Did you print it out?

04:41.846 --> 04:43.152
No. But we never do.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.458
-It's in the system.
-Okay,

04:44.501 --> 04:46.808
check to see if anyone
printed out a hard copy.

04:46.851 --> 04:49.767
Maybe there's some...compulsive Luddite around here.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.203
I'll go to the courthouse.

04:51.247 --> 04:52.379
-Why?
-Julius.

04:52.422 --> 04:54.163
I mean, he gave the order.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.338
[sighs]:
Right.

04:55.382 --> 04:56.644
Want me to go?

04:56.687 --> 04:58.863
Uh, no.
I know who has a way with him.

04:58.907 --> 05:01.170
LANDAU:
And that leaves us

05:01.213 --> 05:03.346
with one
very important question.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.739
What's the biggest issue

05:04.782 --> 05:07.829
facing the African American
community today?

05:12.442 --> 05:15.227
Let it all hang out.
Let's hear it.

05:20.407 --> 05:21.495
Lack of voting rights.

05:23.540 --> 05:24.846
Okay.

05:24.889 --> 05:26.369
Anybody else?

05:26.413 --> 05:28.415
-Racism.
-Police brutality.

05:28.458 --> 05:29.807
Institutionalracism.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.418
LANDAU:
Good, good, good.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.507
All right, follow-up question.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.683
What is the Democratic Party
currently doing

05:35.726 --> 05:37.337
to combat racism?

05:37.380 --> 05:38.860
[several chuckling]

05:38.903 --> 05:41.210
JAY:
The Democratic Party's doing

05:41.253 --> 05:43.734
-jack-shit to combat racism.
-ADRIAN: Jay, Jay, come on.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.257
And the Republicans are doing

05:45.301 --> 05:47.216
-so much better?
-The Democrats care more

05:47.259 --> 05:49.697
about civil rights, but...
where's the policy?

05:49.740 --> 05:51.699
Laws don't get passed
in a vacuum.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.527
Yeah, but they're trying,
at least.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.442
-How about the Green New Deal?
-But that's not

05:55.485 --> 05:57.400
just for black people.

05:57.444 --> 05:58.532
I mean...

05:58.575 --> 06:00.534
black people will benefit, yeah.

06:00.577 --> 06:03.232
But you want me to get excited,line up to vote,

06:03.275 --> 06:04.799
maybe even miss work?

06:04.842 --> 06:07.410
Then I want to feel like the
Dems are talking right to me

06:07.454 --> 06:09.891
-aboutme.
-ADRIAN: What gets us
that feeling?

06:09.934 --> 06:11.632
[quietly]:Excuse me. I need to take this.

06:11.675 --> 06:14.417
It's really interesting stuff
so far.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.245
-[low, indistinct chatter]
-ADRIAN: Hey, hey, hey.

06:16.288 --> 06:19.335
Uh... maybe
we take it down a notch

06:19.379 --> 06:20.945
on the DNC bashing.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.599
[quiet murmuring]

06:23.992 --> 06:26.429
Look at you.

06:26.473 --> 06:27.909
Marissa!

06:27.952 --> 06:29.606
[laughing]:
Oh, my gosh!

06:31.608 --> 06:34.002
Well, I owe
a lot of this to you.

06:34.045 --> 06:35.395
No, no, no.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.005
-Okay, some of it.
-[chuckles]

06:38.615 --> 06:40.704
How are things at,
uh, Reddick/Boseman?

06:40.748 --> 06:42.271
Or is it, uh...

06:42.314 --> 06:44.316
STR Laurie...

06:44.360 --> 06:45.666
-Reddick...
-Weird.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.798
We call it STD Laurie
these days.

06:48.799 --> 06:49.974
STD?

06:50.018 --> 06:52.324
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha...

06:52.368 --> 06:54.457
That was a false laugh,
Your Honor.

06:54.501 --> 06:55.632
[Julius chuckles]

06:55.676 --> 06:57.504
So, do you have a minute?

06:58.548 --> 07:00.420
Mm, court in five minutes,

07:00.463 --> 07:01.464
but, uh...

07:01.508 --> 07:02.987
let's keep 'em waiting.

07:03.031 --> 07:06.469
-I have the power now.
-That's what I like to hear.

07:06.513 --> 07:09.385
-What's up?
-There was an injunction
on a case a few days ago--

07:09.429 --> 07:10.691
an injunction
against a demolition--

07:10.734 --> 07:12.736
and we can't find it
in our system.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.346
We can't find the case, either.

07:14.390 --> 07:15.478
It's something you signed.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.437
Hmm. What case?

07:17.480 --> 07:18.742
Tecades v. Rare Orchard.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.311
[tapping keyboard]

07:22.354 --> 07:24.618
"Rare... Orchard."

07:27.708 --> 07:28.839
[beeps]

07:29.884 --> 07:31.581
It's not in the system.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.844
Yeah, but it's something
you ruled on.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.630
[chuckles]:
Are you sure?

07:36.673 --> 07:39.459
-If it's not in the system...
-We're pretty sure.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.419
[sighs]:
Diane...

07:43.463 --> 07:45.943
-this is old news.
-No, it's not.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.945
We're bringing suit
against Rare Orchard

07:47.989 --> 07:50.078
for ignoring
a judge's injunction,

07:50.121 --> 07:53.081
but we can't do that if we
can't locate the injunction.

07:53.124 --> 07:56.345
-I'm no longer on the case.
-But you ruled on it.

07:56.388 --> 07:57.825
-And you know that you ruled.
-I've had

07:57.868 --> 07:59.827
two dozen rulings since then--
I can't tell you

07:59.870 --> 08:01.742
-every single...
-Julius,

08:01.785 --> 08:03.613
-are you fucking serious?
-Don't swear

08:03.657 --> 08:06.007
-in my chambers!
-You know what?
I never used to swear, ever,

08:06.050 --> 08:08.009
but now I find it useful.

08:08.052 --> 08:10.577
People look at me and think
I would never swear,

08:10.620 --> 08:12.361
so when I say
this is fucking nuts,

08:12.404 --> 08:14.711
it has added meaning,and this is motherfucking nuts.

08:14.755 --> 08:17.453
-I think we're done here.-Why are you doing this, Julius?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.759
-Doing what?
-Pretending you didn't rule

08:18.802 --> 08:21.413
on something you did rule on.
What's going on?

08:22.850 --> 08:24.808
Who's gotten to you?

08:30.422 --> 08:33.034
Talk to Adrian's girlfriend.

08:33.077 --> 08:35.471
Who's Adrian's girlfriend?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.734
I'm needed in court.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.694
[door closes]

08:40.737 --> 08:44.393
Maternal mortality
is too gendered an issue.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.569
And black women aren't the oneswe need to mobilize.

08:46.613 --> 08:49.485
[loud, indistinct chatter]

08:49.529 --> 08:51.748
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Can-can I say something?

08:51.792 --> 08:53.837
-Yeah.
-There's one issue

08:53.881 --> 08:56.797
that is splashy,
covers the economy

08:56.840 --> 08:59.451
and addresses
black folks directly.

08:59.495 --> 09:01.584
[chatter stops]

09:01.628 --> 09:03.412
Reparations.

09:03.455 --> 09:05.806
[people murmuring]

09:05.849 --> 09:07.547
I'm pretty certain
that reparations

09:07.590 --> 09:09.810
is at the top of the...
"never gonna happen" list.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.899
-But what if it weren't?
-BARRY: But...

09:11.942 --> 09:13.901
-it is.
-ROSALYN: The party is moving
further and further left

09:13.944 --> 09:15.685
every day.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.948
There are a lot of ideas
that were once inconceivable

09:17.992 --> 09:20.472
that are now... ordinary.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.083
LEAH:
But this is really far left.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.085
There are a lot
of black conservatives--

09:24.128 --> 09:26.000
maybe not Republican
conservative,

09:26.043 --> 09:28.437
but definitely not
AOC progressive--

09:28.480 --> 09:30.047
and we don't want
to alienate them.

09:30.091 --> 09:32.441
And how exactly
do we make reparations happen,

09:32.484 --> 09:33.964
-practically?
-JAY: Just 'cause
it's complicated

09:34.008 --> 09:35.618
-[knocking]
-doesn't mean
we throw up our hands

09:35.662 --> 09:36.924
-and say we can't do it.
-But we should...

09:36.967 --> 09:38.926
-Do you have a minute?
-For?

09:38.969 --> 09:41.015
Mr. Firth.

09:41.058 --> 09:42.756
Sure. Sure.

09:42.799 --> 09:45.106
Ms. Lockhart,
do you mind joining us?

09:45.149 --> 09:47.021
Uh, sure.

09:47.064 --> 09:48.500
Let's go.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.551
He'll be right with you.

09:57.684 --> 09:58.641
Thank you.

10:01.122 --> 10:03.951
[sighs]:You know, whenever I see offices

10:03.994 --> 10:08.172
like this, I always think thatwe're all gonna be dead someday.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.044
-ADRIAN: My God!
-[laughter]

10:10.087 --> 10:11.741
What's funny?

10:11.785 --> 10:14.744
No, nothing.
Uh, Liz has a...

10:14.788 --> 10:17.181
dark sense of humor.

10:17.225 --> 10:19.749
I have a dark sense of humor.
Tell me.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.491
I was just joking

10:22.534 --> 10:25.494
that we're all
gonna be dead someday.

10:25.537 --> 10:26.495
[others chuckling]

10:26.538 --> 10:27.627
[chuckling stops abruptly]

10:27.670 --> 10:29.063
Uh, you had to be there.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.718
No, I'm right with you. Hmm.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.156
Anyway, please, come sit.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.817
[takes deep breath]

10:47.559 --> 10:49.692
Uh, you wanted to see us?

10:49.736 --> 10:50.911
Yes.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.698
A young man...

10:55.742 --> 10:57.657
begged a Zen master

10:57.700 --> 10:59.876
to teach him the way of truth.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.183
So the master took
the young man by the neck,

11:02.226 --> 11:06.927
dragged him to a stream,
stuck his head underwater.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.972
The young man gasped and fought,

11:09.016 --> 11:12.193
but the master held him
underwater for a full minute.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.674
And then,
just at the brink of death,

11:14.717 --> 11:17.677
he pulled him up
out of the water and asked,

11:17.720 --> 11:21.768
"What did you want most of all
when you were underwater?"

11:21.811 --> 11:25.206
"Air," the young man said.

11:25.249 --> 11:26.860
-Hmm?
-Yeah.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.862
"Well, good,"
the master responded.

11:28.905 --> 11:32.604
"Come back when you want truth
as much as air."

11:39.786 --> 11:41.962
You-you want us to want truth?

11:42.005 --> 11:44.312
That is one way to look at it.

11:44.355 --> 11:47.054
You have the Democratic
Committee as a client?

11:47.097 --> 11:49.883
-We do.
-You're working with them now?

11:49.926 --> 11:51.232
Yes.

11:51.275 --> 11:53.060
And you listed this
as a continuation

11:53.103 --> 11:56.237
of an old case?

11:56.280 --> 11:58.021
Is that a problem?

11:58.065 --> 12:00.676
Only if, in fact,
it's a new case.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.809
I think I'm missing something.
Why does that matter?

12:02.852 --> 12:05.942
Cases prior to the mergerare split 60/40 in favor of RBL.

12:05.986 --> 12:09.772
New business is split 40/60
in favor of STR Laurie.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.774
LIZ:
First of all, how do you know

12:11.818 --> 12:12.949
what we're billing the DNC?

12:12.993 --> 12:15.038
-It's irrelevant.
-No.

12:15.082 --> 12:17.258
No, it's not.
We-we have a two-year

12:17.301 --> 12:19.042
grace period
where we do not look

12:19.086 --> 12:22.742
at each other's books...
to encourage trust.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.353
So how did you get access
to our books?

12:25.396 --> 12:28.095
Trust is why I wanted
to speak with you first.

12:28.138 --> 12:32.795
Is the Democratic Committee
new business or old business?

12:36.799 --> 12:38.366
Old business.

12:38.409 --> 12:40.324
Good.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.065
That is all I needed to know.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.766
Eh? Trust.

12:48.419 --> 12:51.292
So... is it new business?

12:54.904 --> 12:56.863
I could argue it both ways.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.647
And we argued it in our favor.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.954
That is perfectly reasonable,
but the bigger worry

13:00.997 --> 13:02.651
is, how did he know?

13:02.694 --> 13:03.957
He's got a spy.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.306
A spy looking at our books?

13:05.349 --> 13:06.829
That's my guess.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.178
-Who?
-I don't know.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.659
Let's put Marissa on this.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.400
Okay, I'll talk to her.

13:12.443 --> 13:16.360
Um, Adrian, do you have a minutefor a question?

13:16.404 --> 13:19.276
Sure, but it's... old business.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.974
Oh, no, no.

13:21.017 --> 13:25.152
I went to Julius aboutthe missing Tecades injunction,

13:25.195 --> 13:28.285
and he told me if I wanted
to know where it went,

13:28.329 --> 13:31.201
to ask Adrian's girlfriend.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.335
What?

13:34.378 --> 13:37.860
He said, ask your girlfriend,
so let me ask.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.340
Who is your girlfriend,

13:39.383 --> 13:41.864
and why does she know
about my disappearing case?

13:41.908 --> 13:43.866
Julius.

13:46.042 --> 13:48.915
He's probably saying something
to pass the buck.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.267
What buck? What is going on?

13:53.310 --> 13:55.095
Why do I feel like

13:55.138 --> 13:57.706
I'm hearing passwords
in a secret society?

13:57.749 --> 14:00.491
There's no secret society,
Diane.

14:04.974 --> 14:08.978
I'm in a relationship
with a judge.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.893
Now, it is not improper,

14:10.937 --> 14:13.374
and there are certainly
no ex parte conversations.

14:13.417 --> 14:17.769
I just don't like my private
life being made public.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.816
Now you know
that information is power.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.383
And you lose information
to other people,

14:22.426 --> 14:24.994
then you give them
all the power over you.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.388
All right, so without telling methe judge's name,

14:27.431 --> 14:31.479
can you tell me what he meant by"Ask herabout the injunction"?

14:31.522 --> 14:33.829
All I can tell you
is what I heard.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.918
Which was?

14:35.962 --> 14:38.921
Memo 618.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.184
What is that?

14:41.228 --> 14:43.099
I don't know.

14:43.143 --> 14:46.929
I just know that Julius was
really intimidated

14:46.973 --> 14:50.150
by something given
to him called "Memo 618."

14:51.194 --> 14:53.066
That's it. That's all.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.764
-But you don't know what it is?-No.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.853
But if you want to know
what happened to your case,

14:57.897 --> 14:59.986
I'd find out what Memo 618 is.

15:01.465 --> 15:03.467
â™ª

15:35.412 --> 15:37.458
â™ª

16:05.616 --> 16:07.879
â™ª

16:43.437 --> 16:45.439
[indistinct, distant chatter]

16:58.582 --> 17:00.149
[buzzer sounds]

17:18.124 --> 17:20.082
MARISSA:
Since the merger,

17:20.126 --> 17:22.302
there have been 18 associates
from STD Laurie...

17:22.345 --> 17:24.478
W-Wait.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.088
STD?

17:26.132 --> 17:29.091
I'm... so sorry.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.224
Um, it's a mailroom joke.

17:31.267 --> 17:32.921
[laughing]:
Okay.

17:32.964 --> 17:35.924
18 of their associates have beenon our cases,

17:35.967 --> 17:38.144
but only one has had access
to our financials.

17:38.187 --> 17:40.146
-Who?
-Caleb Garlin.

17:40.189 --> 17:41.930
-Who is that?
-Second-year associate,

17:41.973 --> 17:43.584
graduate of
the University of Virginia,

17:43.627 --> 17:45.107
retired Army sergeant.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.022
Retired? What is he, 50?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.371
No. 39.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.112
He primarily works
in litigation,

17:50.156 --> 17:52.593
but he had access to ourfinancials on the Brinkman suit.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.551
Okay. Can you find out
more about him?

17:54.595 --> 17:56.162
Marissa, stick with him.

17:56.205 --> 17:59.252
I don't want him sending
any more gossip upstairs.

17:59.295 --> 18:00.688
MAN:
All rise.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.603
The Honorable
Charlotte Hazlewood presiding.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.300
-CHARLOTTE: Good day.
-Please be seated.

18:04.344 --> 18:06.607
The Honorable Dalton Bradley
has requested

18:06.650 --> 18:09.653
that I take his place
for this hearing. It is...?

18:09.697 --> 18:12.526
Tecades v. Rare Orchard,
Your Honor.

18:12.569 --> 18:15.137
-Unlawful seizure.-Your Honor, if I may interject,

18:15.181 --> 18:16.965
I'm not sure what Ms. Lockhart
is appealing here.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.967
There was no injunction granted,and my crew commenced

18:19.010 --> 18:20.708
-demolition.
-Counselor, I must agree.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.536
What are your grounds
for an appeal?

18:22.579 --> 18:24.451
We're not appealing, Your Honor.The case was never tried.

18:24.494 --> 18:26.627
This is our first time here.

18:26.670 --> 18:30.021
Counselor... anything?

18:30.065 --> 18:31.719
Your Honor, this case
has already been adjudicated.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.286
Really?

18:34.417 --> 18:36.419
Show us the docket number.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.508
Counselor,
let me be the judge, please.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.989
-Apologies.
-Mr. Canning, do you

18:41.032 --> 18:43.296
-have a docket number?
-Uh...

18:43.339 --> 18:45.167
Uh, no, I don't.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.474
Okay, then
let's hear some testimony.

18:47.517 --> 18:48.997
Are you ready, Counselor?

18:49.040 --> 18:50.477
I am, Your Honor.

18:53.741 --> 18:56.744
[overlapping chatter]

18:56.787 --> 18:58.572
Guys, you're going
to lose the white vote.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.661
Okay, let's talk
about this practically.

19:00.704 --> 19:03.098
Who gets reparations?
What form do they take?

19:03.142 --> 19:04.534
What's the price tag?

19:04.578 --> 19:07.363
Well, the last one is easy--
40 acres and a mule.

19:07.407 --> 19:10.323
[loud, overlapping chatter]

19:10.366 --> 19:11.585
MAN:
Wait. Wait.

19:11.628 --> 19:13.021
ADRIAN:
Wait. Just wait a second.

19:13.064 --> 19:15.284
You all serious about this?

19:15.328 --> 19:17.286
Because there is a model
for reparations

19:17.330 --> 19:19.332
right here in Chicago.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.203
-Jon Burge.
-Right.

19:21.247 --> 19:23.205
-JAY: Who?
-Jon Burge.

19:23.249 --> 19:26.774
He was an old
Chicago Police commander.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.732
Tortured over 100 black men,

19:28.776 --> 19:30.430
so the city of Chicago
passed an ordinance

19:30.473 --> 19:34.085
condemning the torture,
giving monetary damages

19:34.129 --> 19:36.044
to the survivors' families,

19:36.087 --> 19:39.265
and then,
they made a history curriculum

19:39.308 --> 19:41.267
about Burge mandatory

19:41.310 --> 19:43.791
to middle
and high school students.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.793
There's your model right there.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.795
And the white vote is gonna say,

19:47.838 --> 19:49.753
"None of us were alive
when slavery happened."

19:49.797 --> 19:52.539
Which is why we focus
on the victims of Jim Crow.

19:52.582 --> 19:55.542
-There are plenty of survivors.-That defeats the purpose.

19:55.585 --> 19:58.240
Slavery is the original sin,
the stain on America's soul.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.547
-Reparations is penance.
-You mean absolution.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.375
As soon as that check clears,

20:02.418 --> 20:04.290
white America washes
their hands,

20:04.333 --> 20:06.248
and I'm telling you,
the line will be,

20:06.292 --> 20:08.163
"Don't you fuckers ever complainabout racism again."

20:08.207 --> 20:09.773
JAY:
Well, people who feel like

20:09.817 --> 20:12.211
reparations equals hush money
were always gonna feel that.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.560
LEAH:
But I think
you're underestimating

20:13.603 --> 20:15.257
-the power of white...
-JAY: No. No, I'm not.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.520
-May I have a word?
-JAY: No, I'm not. Listen...

20:17.564 --> 20:20.306
What do you think about where
the conversation's going?

20:20.349 --> 20:22.308
I think...

20:22.351 --> 20:24.397
our people are passionate
and engaged,

20:24.440 --> 20:27.443
and we can translate that energyinto voters.

20:27.487 --> 20:30.098
I know it's a conversation
that needs to be had.

20:30.141 --> 20:33.101
I just wonder if we need more...diversity in the room.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.624
Diversity?

20:34.668 --> 20:37.801
Just to gauge
how the ideas are landing.

20:37.845 --> 20:40.151
â™ª

20:46.636 --> 20:48.638
â™ª

20:52.338 --> 20:53.774
Hard at work?

20:53.817 --> 20:57.168
Uh, this may look easy,
but it's not.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.736
-You try peeling a rutabaga.
-That's the game?

20:59.780 --> 21:01.434
You just peel a rutabaga?

21:01.477 --> 21:03.392
Just? Seriously?
I feel judged.

21:03.436 --> 21:05.307
[Marissa chuckles]

21:05.351 --> 21:08.310
I didn't mean to disparage
your vegetable-peeling skills.

21:08.354 --> 21:10.660
I'm sure they'll come in handy
at many law firms.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.836
Also, it's fruit,
and it's kind of soothing.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.447
Do you need to be soothed?

21:14.490 --> 21:16.797
[laughs] That's...

21:16.840 --> 21:18.886
that's a very personal question.Aah!

21:18.929 --> 21:20.714
Damn. [sighs]

21:20.757 --> 21:22.759
Sorry.

21:22.803 --> 21:25.153
So are you Caleb?

21:25.196 --> 21:27.329
-I am. Who are you?
-Marissa.

21:28.374 --> 21:29.679
Are you from upstairs?

21:29.723 --> 21:31.594
I am.

21:31.638 --> 21:33.204
Then why are you working here?

21:33.248 --> 21:34.597
They asked me to.

21:34.641 --> 21:36.730
Why did they ask you to?

21:36.773 --> 21:38.775
Um, I think...

21:38.819 --> 21:40.908
[whispering]:
to spy on you.

21:40.951 --> 21:44.781
That's not a great way to spy--to say you're spying.

21:44.825 --> 21:47.654
I know. I'm not very good at it.

21:47.697 --> 21:51.310
You are... very different
from what I expected.

21:54.225 --> 21:56.532
You want to play the next round?

21:56.576 --> 21:58.360
You'll have to teach me.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.406
Yeah, okay.
Uh, this is a keyboard.

22:00.449 --> 22:02.843
They need you two upstairs
in the conference room.

22:02.886 --> 22:05.759
-Us? Why?
-Diversity.

22:05.802 --> 22:09.371
[loud, overlapping chatter]

22:12.461 --> 22:14.855
Are we starting?
I have a couple of questions.

22:14.898 --> 22:17.379
-David Lee.
-Exactly how much

22:17.423 --> 22:21.514
is 40 acres and a mule
in 2020 dollars?

22:21.557 --> 22:23.690
-However much it is,
it's still not enough.
-DAVID: Go back

22:23.733 --> 22:26.214
far enough,and everyone comes from a tribe

22:26.257 --> 22:28.608
that was taken over
by another tribe.

22:28.651 --> 22:31.219
That's the history of the world.So do we all

22:31.262 --> 22:32.699
-deserve reparations?
-MARISSA: We got

22:32.742 --> 22:34.570
-reparations from Nazi Germany.-DAVID: You maybe did.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.572
-I didn't.
-MARISSA: Our relatives did.

22:36.616 --> 22:39.401
-Oh.
-Listen, this idea
of needing reparations

22:39.445 --> 22:41.534
is just perpetuating
stereotypes.

22:41.577 --> 22:43.753
Black folks don't need handouts.

22:43.797 --> 22:45.407
-What is he talking about?
-[overlapping chatter]

22:45.451 --> 22:47.235
-You are missing the point.
-LUCCA: Jimmy,

22:47.278 --> 22:48.932
reparations aren't a handout.

22:48.976 --> 22:50.717
They're payment owed
for services rendered.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.458
JIMMY:
Did you do that work?

22:52.501 --> 22:54.547
If my ancestors picked cotton
for 50 years,

22:54.590 --> 22:56.418
then they deserve that money,
not me.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.246
-Hear! Hear!
-MARISSA: Oh, my God.
You got David Lee

22:58.289 --> 22:59.595
agreeing with you. Be proud.

22:59.639 --> 23:01.292
MICAH:
Look, if your ancestors
were paid

23:01.336 --> 23:02.772
for that workand they passed that money down,

23:02.816 --> 23:05.253
you would see itas family wealth, wouldn't you?

23:05.296 --> 23:06.385
-Exactly.
-[overlapping chatter]

23:06.428 --> 23:08.430
ADRIAN:
Um, just wait one second.

23:08.474 --> 23:12.869
Vernon Jordan told me a story
about growing up in Georgia.

23:12.913 --> 23:16.395
When he was a boy,
the governor came on the radio

23:16.438 --> 23:19.920
and said,
"I'm running for reelection,

23:19.963 --> 23:22.662
"and I have two planks
in my platform.

23:22.705 --> 23:26.535
"Niggers. Roads.

23:26.579 --> 23:30.321
I'm against the first,
and I am for the second."

23:30.365 --> 23:32.498
Now, this was the governor,

23:32.541 --> 23:34.848
[chuckles]:
for Christ's sake.

23:34.891 --> 23:38.504
Now, do we think
he wasn't writing that vitriol

23:38.547 --> 23:40.549
into his official policy?

23:40.593 --> 23:42.551
Well, I say keep
the reparations.

23:42.595 --> 23:44.292
I'd rather have white guilt.

23:44.335 --> 23:45.815
That I can leverage.

23:45.859 --> 23:48.427
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

23:48.470 --> 23:51.778
Marta, did you have any warningabout this demolition?

23:51.821 --> 23:54.476
[crying]:
No. They just did it.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.782
And, so,
what are you going to do?

23:55.825 --> 23:57.784
I have no idea.

23:57.827 --> 24:01.614
That restaurant was my life,
my world.

24:01.657 --> 24:04.312
I'm not exaggerating.

24:04.355 --> 24:06.314
It was the only income
that I had.

24:06.357 --> 24:07.794
My family. I...

24:07.837 --> 24:09.970
-We don't know what...-Should I continue, Your Honor?

24:10.013 --> 24:12.451
-Just one second.
-[paper rustling]

24:22.852 --> 24:24.811
You may continue, Counselor.

24:26.377 --> 24:27.640
Counselor.

24:27.683 --> 24:29.990
Uh, yes.

24:30.033 --> 24:32.383
Um, Marta, you had some,

24:32.427 --> 24:35.082
uh, negative reviews
in the last few months.

24:35.125 --> 24:38.346
-Yes.
-DIANE: And you recently
discovered who wrote

24:38.389 --> 24:39.739
-those reviews?
-Objection, Your Honor.

24:39.782 --> 24:41.697
-Relevance.
-Sustained.

24:41.741 --> 24:45.527
We're merely trying to establishrelevance, Your Honor.

24:45.571 --> 24:46.920
No need. I've already ruled.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.444
Well, how can you determine

24:49.488 --> 24:51.011
the relevance of this evidence?

24:51.054 --> 24:53.840
-I don't...-Counselor, you need to move on.

24:55.885 --> 24:59.889
Um, have you found that, uh,

24:59.933 --> 25:02.544
Rare Orchard was attempting
to sabotage you

25:02.588 --> 25:05.025
-by publishing negative reviews?-CHARLOTTE: Counselor.

25:05.068 --> 25:06.896
No. I have already ruled.

25:06.940 --> 25:08.855
Do you have any other questions,or are you done?

25:08.898 --> 25:11.074
-I just have
one more question, Your Honor.
-Does it have

25:11.118 --> 25:12.772
anything to do
with these negative reviews?

25:12.815 --> 25:13.860
No.

25:13.903 --> 25:15.122
Good.

25:15.165 --> 25:16.558
You may proceed.

25:16.602 --> 25:17.733
What is Memo 618?

25:17.777 --> 25:19.518
Objection, Your Honor.

25:19.561 --> 25:20.693
Counselor, you are done.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.652
Why? I'm just asking
what Memo 618 is.

25:23.696 --> 25:25.567
-That's all.
-It is not relevant
to this case.

25:25.611 --> 25:28.048
DIANE:The last time a judge was faced

25:28.091 --> 25:30.659
with Memo 618,
my case disappeared.

25:30.703 --> 25:32.052
And I see you were just handed

25:32.095 --> 25:34.707
a document
with "Memo 618" on it,

25:34.750 --> 25:36.012
and that's why it is relevant.

25:36.056 --> 25:38.885
Counselor, you are in contempt.

25:38.928 --> 25:41.975
Why? If Memo 618 means nothing,

25:42.018 --> 25:43.063
why should I be held
in contempt?

25:43.106 --> 25:44.151
Court is adjourned.

25:44.194 --> 25:46.980
-Until when?
-Until I fucking decide.

25:47.023 --> 25:49.025
[people murmuring]

25:54.030 --> 25:55.684
Lucca Quinn?

25:56.859 --> 25:58.992
Do you mind
accompanying me upstairs?

25:59.035 --> 26:00.863
Why?

26:00.907 --> 26:02.604
It's been requested.

26:13.528 --> 26:15.922
Hello, Lucca. I'm Edie Ham.

26:15.965 --> 26:18.011
This is Cleo and Paula.

26:18.054 --> 26:20.448
Hi.

26:20.491 --> 26:23.451
-Have I done something wrong?
-[Edie chuckles]

26:23.494 --> 26:25.758
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:25.801 --> 26:28.935
No, I know human resources
has a scary reputation,

26:28.978 --> 26:31.633
but we're just plain folk
just like you.

26:31.677 --> 26:34.810
Good to hear. So, uh, why...

26:34.854 --> 26:37.596
EDIE:
A small thing, maybe.
There's been a complaint

26:37.639 --> 26:39.467
about a senior attorney
at your firm.

26:39.510 --> 26:41.512
But first,
I need you to not share

26:41.556 --> 26:44.167
what we're about to discuss withthe attorney in question, okay?

26:47.823 --> 26:48.824
Lucca?

26:48.868 --> 26:51.697
I understand what you're asking.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.960
Which attorney
are we discussing?

26:55.004 --> 26:57.006
Adrian Boseman.

26:58.094 --> 27:00.706
Well,
he's my immediate superior,

27:00.749 --> 27:03.491
so I can't promise you anything.

27:03.534 --> 27:06.712
It's up to you whether you-you
want to share with me or not.

27:11.847 --> 27:15.590
Apparently,
Mr. Boseman used the N-word.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.594
[laughs]

27:19.638 --> 27:22.031
-Oh, you're kidding.
-EDIE: No.

27:22.075 --> 27:24.512
And we don't find it
at all comical.

27:24.555 --> 27:26.949
We're hoping you can shed
some light on what happened

27:26.993 --> 27:29.517
and if Mr. Boseman
has used the N-word

27:29.560 --> 27:32.041
in your presence
on prior occasions.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.773
[whispers]:
What?

28:21.177 --> 28:23.136
What's wrong?

28:23.179 --> 28:25.312
I need to talk to you, Liz.

28:25.355 --> 28:27.227
Okay. About?

28:27.270 --> 28:30.752
I was asked not to discuss thiswith Adrian.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.756
Asked by who?

28:34.800 --> 28:36.497
Unfortunately,
I was asked not to say.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.760
But I can tell Liz.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.460
You were asked by whom?

28:43.504 --> 28:45.462
LUCCA:
Human resources.

28:45.506 --> 28:48.727
They asked me if Mr. Boseman
had used the N-word.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.729
-Jesus Christ.
-LIZ: When did he use

28:50.772 --> 28:53.296
-the N-word?
-I was quoting Vernon Jordan.

28:53.340 --> 28:55.124
LUCCA:
Apparently, STR Laurie has

28:55.168 --> 28:58.388
a zero tolerance policy
on inappropriate language.

28:58.432 --> 28:59.738
[laughs]:
This is bullshit.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.304
Who told them?

29:01.348 --> 29:02.653
They didn't say.

29:02.697 --> 29:04.873
You know who was there
in the room?

29:04.917 --> 29:06.135
Who?

29:06.179 --> 29:08.181
Caleb.

29:08.224 --> 29:10.270
-I don't think it's him.
-ADRIAN: Why not?

29:10.313 --> 29:12.185
Isn't he feeding info upstairs?

29:12.228 --> 29:13.708
I don't know.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.318
It just doesn't seem like him.
He's sort of honest.

29:15.362 --> 29:17.799
-In what way, honest?
-When I asked him why

29:17.843 --> 29:20.541
he was working on our floor,
he said he was spying on us.

29:20.584 --> 29:23.239
-[chuckles]: I'm sorry, what?
-MARISSA: He was joking.

29:23.283 --> 29:24.675
If he was actually spying on us,he wouldn't say

29:24.719 --> 29:26.155
-he was spying on us.
-ADRIAN: Well, maybe that's

29:26.199 --> 29:28.288
exactly what he would say.

29:28.331 --> 29:29.593
It's a bluff.

29:30.638 --> 29:32.161
You like him?

29:32.205 --> 29:33.728
Yeah, I guess so.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.644
Okay. Well,
there's a way we can find out

29:36.687 --> 29:39.386
if he's feeding information
upstairs.

29:39.429 --> 29:42.345
Just tell him that we're
thinking of taking on the DNC

29:42.389 --> 29:44.434
as a pro bono client
in order to...

29:44.478 --> 29:46.828
to keep money from STR Laurie.

29:46.872 --> 29:48.569
-How do I do that?
-LIZ: Marissa,

29:48.612 --> 29:49.918
you sometimes blurt things out.

29:49.962 --> 29:52.878
So just blurt it out.

29:55.619 --> 29:57.317
JAY:
Maybe it was a bug on your...

29:57.360 --> 29:59.841
There. That's the same.

29:59.885 --> 30:02.322
Then maybe it's the website.
What'd you do next?

30:02.365 --> 30:04.541
DIANE:
I typed, "What is Memo 618?"

30:14.900 --> 30:16.379
I don't know.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.425
Seems like targeted malware.

30:18.468 --> 30:20.253
I'll look into it.

30:20.296 --> 30:22.559
Thank you. But be careful.

30:22.603 --> 30:25.214
-What do you mean?
-I don't know.

30:25.258 --> 30:26.607
Something's going on.

30:27.651 --> 30:30.263
I'll be careful.

30:31.264 --> 30:33.222
You still rutabaga-ing?

30:33.266 --> 30:35.529
No. Working.

-How about you?
-Always working.

30:37.531 --> 30:39.925
You sound different.
What's wrong?

30:39.968 --> 30:42.231
Nothing. I'm just...

30:42.275 --> 30:44.451
Upstairs has asked me
to look into something.

30:44.494 --> 30:46.453
Oh. Upstairs?

30:46.496 --> 30:48.281
Not your upstairs. My upstairs.

30:48.324 --> 30:49.543
What is it?

30:49.586 --> 30:52.372
I've been told
not to tell anyone.

30:59.596 --> 31:01.555
Don't you want to know?

31:01.598 --> 31:02.991
Hmm? No. No.

31:03.035 --> 31:05.776
You were told not to tell,
don't tell.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.996
But maybe I want to tell you.

31:09.998 --> 31:11.304
Why?

31:11.347 --> 31:13.523
You're right.
I'll just tell you.

31:13.567 --> 31:15.786
You do whatever you want
with it.

31:15.830 --> 31:19.573
We charged the DNC
as a pro bono client

31:19.616 --> 31:21.880
in order to keep the money
from STR Laurie.

31:24.926 --> 31:28.799
Do you want me to tell upstairs?

31:28.843 --> 31:30.627
No.

31:30.671 --> 31:32.934
I want you to do what you want.

31:32.978 --> 31:35.937
Okay.

31:35.981 --> 31:38.026
Then I will.

How many times did you hear
the N-word used?

31:51.039 --> 31:52.823
I think he said it once.

31:52.867 --> 31:55.652
And were you offended
when you heard the word?

31:55.696 --> 31:57.611
No. I think he was just quotingsomeone else.

31:57.654 --> 31:59.308
EDIE:What about the rest of the room?

31:59.352 --> 32:00.614
Do you think
any of the other associates

32:00.657 --> 32:01.832
-were offended?
-LEAH: There's always someone

32:01.876 --> 32:03.922
who's gonna be offended,
but being offended

32:03.965 --> 32:05.836
doesn't mean you have to run
to human resources.

32:05.880 --> 32:09.318
It shouldn't feel like going
to HR is crossing enemy lines.

32:09.362 --> 32:12.974
-We're all
on the same side here.
-But only HR disciplines.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.933
Because people need to feel safein their working environment

32:14.976 --> 32:16.499
and know that
there will be consequences

32:16.543 --> 32:18.501
-for poor behavior.
-Mm.

32:18.545 --> 32:21.374
And a black person using
the N-word is poor behavior?

32:22.375 --> 32:24.029
We're investigating the context.

32:24.072 --> 32:26.988
Well, I fall on the "nosnitching" end of the spectrum.

32:27.032 --> 32:30.426
And I realize
that can be dangerous.

32:30.470 --> 32:34.996
The last thing we want here
is a culture of silence.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.737
What did you think
of the incident?

32:36.780 --> 32:38.478
I didn't think of it
as an incident.

32:38.521 --> 32:40.001
EDIE:
What did you think of it as?

32:40.045 --> 32:41.698
I didn't think of it
as anything.

32:41.742 --> 32:43.744
You report directly
to Adrian Boseman, right?

32:43.787 --> 32:45.354
I report to a lot of people.

32:45.398 --> 32:48.009
I just wanted to clarify
that there is no risk

32:48.053 --> 32:50.359
of anything you say
getting back to him.

32:50.403 --> 32:53.754
Had you ever heard Adrian
Boseman use the N-word before?

32:53.797 --> 32:56.452
It's possible.
I'm not keeping count.

32:56.496 --> 32:57.845
And what was the content

32:57.888 --> 32:59.542
of the story
Mr. Boseman told you?

32:59.586 --> 33:01.414
-You can summarize.
-[Jay exhales]

33:01.457 --> 33:03.024
I don't think I can summarize,

33:03.068 --> 33:04.895
actually.

33:04.939 --> 33:07.028
It's the only thing
that did offend me,

33:07.072 --> 33:08.987
so I remember it pretty clearly.

33:09.030 --> 33:12.381
The governor of Georgia
actually said on the radio,

33:12.425 --> 33:14.905
"I have two planks
in my platform.

33:14.949 --> 33:17.734
"Niggers and roads.

33:17.778 --> 33:20.128
"I'm against the first

33:20.172 --> 33:22.174
and for the second."

33:33.924 --> 33:35.752
Hey. What's up?

33:35.796 --> 33:38.581
I, uh, found out something
you can use.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.714
Something I can use?
I don't understand.

33:40.757 --> 33:43.586
You think I spied
on you guys, right?

33:43.630 --> 33:45.414
-No. I...
-Marissa, listen.

33:45.458 --> 33:48.156
Frank Landau is buddy-buddy
with Gavin upstairs.

33:48.200 --> 33:51.203
He's the one who told Gavin
it's a new case.

33:53.074 --> 33:55.598
I didn't need to know that.

33:55.642 --> 33:57.992
Yeah, but now you do.

34:00.603 --> 34:02.431
[phone rings]

34:02.475 --> 34:03.998
Hello.

34:05.782 --> 34:07.654
Mr. Jordan.

34:07.697 --> 34:09.482
How are you?

34:16.141 --> 34:18.186
Is that right?

34:20.623 --> 34:22.930
So, you dragged Vernon Jordan
into this?

34:22.973 --> 34:24.714
Adrian,
you'll have to start again.

34:24.758 --> 34:27.761
-What are you talking about?
-HR called Vernon Jordan.

34:27.804 --> 34:30.068
Investigating me
for the capital crime

34:30.111 --> 34:32.461
[laughs]:
of using the N-word.

34:32.505 --> 34:33.941
Well, unfortunately,
I can't stand in the way

34:33.984 --> 34:35.203
of an HR investigation.

34:35.247 --> 34:36.900
Oh, this is
a bullshit investigation.

34:36.944 --> 34:39.207
It's not a bullshit
investigation.

34:39.251 --> 34:41.775
It is our standard
to thoroughly explore

34:41.818 --> 34:44.082
any legitimate
employee complaint.

34:44.125 --> 34:45.822
This is not legitimate!

34:47.911 --> 34:51.089
Now, I understand,
you need to cover your ass.

34:51.132 --> 34:54.831
But you and I both know
this is far from legitimate.

34:54.875 --> 34:59.097
Well, what I know is that
you're aware of the rules.

34:59.140 --> 35:01.621
You didn't sign your contract
that long ago.

35:01.664 --> 35:03.927
STR Laurie and all its divisions

35:03.971 --> 35:06.582
has a zero tolerance policy

35:06.626 --> 35:09.150
for offensive language
and harassment at work.

35:09.194 --> 35:11.805
Harassment.
Wow, wow, it's-it's...

35:11.848 --> 35:13.154
it's growing now, huh?

35:13.198 --> 35:15.156
I got into this
with human resources,

35:15.200 --> 35:17.854
and they think that
the best course of action now

35:17.898 --> 35:19.682
is for everyone
at Reddick/Boseman

35:19.726 --> 35:22.120
to take a class on sensitivity

35:22.163 --> 35:24.165
in the workplace.

35:24.209 --> 35:28.169
And we'd prefer if you
didn't use that word again

35:28.213 --> 35:29.866
at the office.

35:29.910 --> 35:31.564
You would prefer?

35:31.607 --> 35:34.741
Adrian, consideringthe charged nature of that word,

35:34.784 --> 35:36.743
it would be best.

35:38.266 --> 35:40.964
You don't dictate

35:41.008 --> 35:43.706
which words I get to use...

35:43.750 --> 35:45.578
or when.

35:57.938 --> 36:00.158
What if I quit?

36:00.201 --> 36:01.681
Okay.

36:01.724 --> 36:03.857
Call the movers...

36:03.900 --> 36:06.076
and rent an office.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.209
[groans]

36:08.253 --> 36:10.559
Maybe take out an ad.

36:10.603 --> 36:12.953
Don't be so sure
I won't walk, Liz.

36:15.216 --> 36:17.610
I have done it before.

36:18.611 --> 36:20.047
I'm the one who walked.

36:20.090 --> 36:22.049
Only because...

36:22.092 --> 36:24.138
I made it impossible
for you to stay.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.706
Only because I pushed you to it.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.232
Oh, God, just take the class.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.930
Just do what they want
and move forward.

36:33.974 --> 36:35.758
I mean,
you know what the game is.

36:35.802 --> 36:37.847
You know how to play it.

36:38.848 --> 36:40.894
Or don't play it.

36:40.937 --> 36:42.200
This is exhausting.

36:42.243 --> 36:44.245
Just... fuck the class.
Do what you want.

36:44.289 --> 36:47.117
-Hmm.
-What are they gonna do?

36:47.161 --> 36:50.251
Are they really gonna fire theirmost senior black male employee

36:50.295 --> 36:52.949
because he used the N-word
in a quote?

36:52.993 --> 36:54.821
Yeah, it sounds
even more ridiculous

36:54.864 --> 36:56.823
when I say it out loud.

36:56.866 --> 36:59.695
And-and don't forget
about that photo.

36:59.739 --> 37:01.175
What photo?

37:01.219 --> 37:04.178
Couple of years ago,
they took that class picture

37:04.222 --> 37:06.615
of their 40 new hires,
and someone online posted

37:06.659 --> 37:08.878
that there wasn't
a single black face in it.

37:08.922 --> 37:11.403
And then they photoshopped in
three black faces.

37:12.404 --> 37:13.883
[Adrian chuckles]

37:13.927 --> 37:15.798
They really did that.

37:15.842 --> 37:18.236
They bought us
to put us in their pictures.

37:18.279 --> 37:21.326
Oh, makes me feel warm all over.

37:21.369 --> 37:24.720
Well, the good news is
that they need us.

37:24.764 --> 37:26.374
Not-not just the floor.

37:26.418 --> 37:28.158
They need us.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.160
So do what you want.

37:30.204 --> 37:32.685
'Cause they ain't gonna fire us.

37:33.686 --> 37:34.904
Hmm.

37:38.212 --> 37:40.345
-Excuse me.
-Yeah. Jay.

37:41.346 --> 37:42.825
[clears throat]
Okay.

37:42.869 --> 37:45.828
I think we should put it
on the table.

37:45.872 --> 37:48.004
-Put what on the table?
-It's uncomfortable

37:48.048 --> 37:50.006
to pretend that someone
didn't violate the space,

37:50.050 --> 37:51.660
so let's just talk about it.

37:51.704 --> 37:53.923
-Who filed the complaint?
-Jay, that is

37:53.967 --> 37:56.012
-completely inappropriate.
-How can we have
an honest conversation

37:56.056 --> 37:58.232
about reparations and the thingsblack people in this country

37:58.276 --> 38:00.321
have experienced
when we're tiptoeing around

38:00.365 --> 38:02.236
how this complaint
is being handled?

38:02.280 --> 38:03.846
MADELINE:
Everyone in this room,

38:03.890 --> 38:06.022
at this firm,
has the right to go to HR

38:06.066 --> 38:08.286
as they see fit,
without fear of retribution.

38:08.329 --> 38:10.679
-I'm not talking about payback.-ADRIAN: Okay, Jay, I don't

38:10.723 --> 38:12.333
-need you to
fight this battle for me.
-It's not for you.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.683
I think we all have
a right to know.

38:14.727 --> 38:17.164
Oh, come on,
I'd rather cut my wrists

38:17.207 --> 38:19.253
-than go to HR willingly.
-MICAH: What kills me

38:19.297 --> 38:21.211
is that this company
is more concerned

38:21.255 --> 38:22.822
about making sure that they seem

38:22.865 --> 38:24.824
racially sensitive
instead of actually being

38:24.867 --> 38:27.348
-racially sensitive.
-LEAH: Yeah,
that quote was heartbreaking.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.394
And the only thing
that person got from it

38:29.437 --> 38:31.047
was that a bad word was said?

38:31.091 --> 38:33.049
-This looks intense.
-Yeah. Welcome.

38:33.093 --> 38:34.877
JAY:
Yes, it's a violent word

38:34.921 --> 38:36.749
with a violent history.

38:36.792 --> 38:39.229
But black people reckon with itevery day.

38:39.273 --> 38:40.927
It's ourword.

38:40.970 --> 38:42.798
If we use it,
if we don't use it,

38:42.842 --> 38:44.147
when we use, where we use it--

38:44.191 --> 38:45.714
you don't get to have
an opinion.

38:45.758 --> 38:47.847
Autonomy over that word

38:47.890 --> 38:50.197
-is our reparations.
-DAVID: Then good.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.721
-You don't need
us white people here anymore.-ADRIAN: Just wait, wait, wait.

38:52.765 --> 38:54.201
DAVID:
No, you heard him.

38:54.244 --> 38:56.029
-He doesn't want us here.
-I think we should go back

38:56.072 --> 38:57.683
-to the original group
on this project.
-MARISSA: Hang on a second.

38:57.726 --> 38:59.728
You don't know for sure that itwas a white person who snitched.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.730
-It could have been anyone.
-Yeah, well, I think we know

39:01.774 --> 39:03.079
who the most likely
suspects are.

39:03.123 --> 39:05.212
-Go to hell, lady.
-Whoa.

39:05.255 --> 39:06.344
[all clamoring]

39:06.387 --> 39:08.215
Hey. Show some respect.

39:08.258 --> 39:10.391
ROSALYN:
I agree with Jay.
This conversation

39:10.435 --> 39:11.914
has completely derailed
ever since we changed

39:11.958 --> 39:14.743
-the group dynamics.
-ADRIAN: It's still important

39:14.787 --> 39:17.006
to get different perspectives
and points of view.

39:17.050 --> 39:18.399
But clearly, there's a limit.

39:18.443 --> 39:19.792
-There's always limits.
-And the person

39:19.835 --> 39:21.402
who alwaysgets
to draw the line,

39:21.446 --> 39:24.753
regardless of race, isthe person with the most power.

39:24.797 --> 39:28.366
Adrian, you hold the power
in this room and out of it.

39:28.409 --> 39:31.760
Sometimes people have to find
alternative ways to level

39:31.804 --> 39:32.979
the playing field.

39:33.022 --> 39:34.807
And that's
exactly why departments

39:34.850 --> 39:37.287
like human resources exist.

39:37.331 --> 39:39.899
So... you filed the complaint?

39:39.942 --> 39:42.423
-Don't answer that.
He has no right to ask.
-MADELINE: It doesn't matter

39:42.467 --> 39:46.384
who filed it, and I don't care
who the N-word belongs to.

39:46.427 --> 39:49.169
Every black person should have
the choice not to hear it

39:49.212 --> 39:51.780
in their workplace
if they don't want to.

39:51.824 --> 39:54.392
Especially
when it's literally part

39:54.435 --> 39:56.306
of the employer's policy.

39:56.350 --> 39:58.004
We can all come up with reasons

39:58.047 --> 40:00.136
why we don't want
to hear the word.

40:00.180 --> 40:03.226
But when it comes down to it,
you're confronting the past,

40:03.270 --> 40:05.315
-and it's painful.
-JAY: And there's
no avoiding it.

40:05.359 --> 40:08.144
So we're supposed to confront
the past between depositions?

40:08.188 --> 40:10.016
Perhaps some of us would prefer

40:10.059 --> 40:12.322
to do our emotional
heavy lifting

40:12.366 --> 40:14.499
outside the office.

40:14.542 --> 40:17.980
Madeline, we could have talked
about this privately.

40:18.024 --> 40:20.374
There was no reason
to go upstairs.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.158
Oh, you want special treatment

40:22.202 --> 40:24.465
because you're
a big-name partner?

40:24.509 --> 40:27.816
Well, the people upstairs are
the big names now, and I think

40:27.860 --> 40:30.819
we should follow the rules
of the firm you made us join.

40:30.863 --> 40:33.822
If you filed the complaint,
at least own it.

40:33.866 --> 40:36.477
Jay, I know
you don't see it this way,

40:36.521 --> 40:38.914
but this little stunt
you pulled...

40:38.958 --> 40:40.916
it's called intimidation.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.832
[loud, overlapping chatter]

40:43.876 --> 40:45.834
ADRIAN:
I know it's a bit heated.

40:45.878 --> 40:47.488
-More than heated.
-We have a lot

40:47.532 --> 40:49.838
of intensely passionate people
on our team,

40:49.882 --> 40:52.014
and their opinions
are unwavering.

40:52.058 --> 40:54.147
And it's
a difficult subject matter.

40:54.190 --> 40:57.585
Listen, everyone at the DNC
applauds your innovation.

40:57.629 --> 41:00.022
You've obviously chosen
the most off-beaten path.

41:00.066 --> 41:02.416
We're just not sure this is
the right direction for us.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.504
Thanks for your efforts.

41:03.548 --> 41:04.940
-Frank...
-Thanks, Adrian.

41:09.336 --> 41:12.208
Tim and Marcus
are ordering lunch.

41:12.252 --> 41:15.516
Tim teases Marcus about
how much he loves watermelon.

41:15.560 --> 41:19.128
He accuses Marcus
of having a sticky keyboard,

41:19.172 --> 41:23.089
and after a few coworkers laugh,they move on with their day.

41:23.132 --> 41:25.265
Who would say that was
a goodinteraction?

41:27.093 --> 41:30.575
Okay. Who would say that was
an uncomfortable situation?

41:34.361 --> 41:37.233
Who would say
that was unacceptable?

41:37.277 --> 41:39.975
I didn't know we could choose
worse than uncomfortable.

41:40.019 --> 41:41.411
Can I change my vote?

41:41.455 --> 41:43.065
You didn't raise your hand.

41:43.109 --> 41:45.198
We need everyone to participate.

41:45.241 --> 41:46.939
I don't know Marcus.

41:46.982 --> 41:49.202
Maybe he really likes
watermelon.

41:49.245 --> 41:51.552
Maybe Tim was correct
in his commentary.

41:51.596 --> 41:53.554
Marcus does not eat watermelon.

41:53.598 --> 41:55.338
Then Tim is a racist.

41:55.382 --> 41:57.079
[soft laughter]

41:59.386 --> 42:02.563
Karly and Marie are touching uptheir hair in the bathroom...

42:02.607 --> 42:04.913
-You're in a mood.
-This is bullshit.

42:04.957 --> 42:06.959
Welcome to corporate America.

42:07.002 --> 42:09.091
-We all have to do it.
-Not everyone.

42:09.135 --> 42:11.093
No, everyone.

42:11.137 --> 42:13.922
You see Adrian, Liz, Diane?

42:13.966 --> 42:16.185
They still have to do it.

42:16.229 --> 42:19.014
Just not with the peasants.

42:35.378 --> 42:36.641
[knock on door]

42:37.685 --> 42:39.600
You needed me, Ms. Reddick?

42:39.644 --> 42:42.211
-Yes. Caleb, right?
-Right.

42:42.255 --> 42:45.650
I just wanted to thank you
for helping us out upstairs.

42:45.693 --> 42:48.348
Sure. Just doing my job.

42:48.391 --> 42:50.959
And if there's anything
you need from us,

42:51.003 --> 42:53.135
just tell me.

42:53.179 --> 42:54.659
Okay.

42:54.702 --> 42:57.183
Good.

43:01.013 --> 43:02.667
Yes?

43:02.710 --> 43:04.582
Second chair.

43:04.625 --> 43:06.105
On?

43:06.148 --> 43:09.238
Anything. I'm here to learn.

43:09.282 --> 43:12.590
Then we'll do our best to teach.

43:16.681 --> 43:18.726
Okay.

43:28.040 --> 43:30.172
[knock on door]

43:30.216 --> 43:32.000
-What's wrong?
-I don't know,

43:32.044 --> 43:33.654
but this is weird.

43:33.698 --> 43:36.352
I went to the same website,
Bar-Swarm,

43:36.396 --> 43:38.137
using my home Wi-Fi.

43:38.180 --> 43:39.747
And...

43:39.791 --> 43:41.662
DIANE:
No rejection of service?

43:41.706 --> 43:44.012
Right. There's no malware
at home. But watch.

43:44.056 --> 43:46.798
I'm on the office Wi-Fi now.

43:48.451 --> 43:49.670
[high-pitched beeping]

43:49.714 --> 43:53.195
[beeping slows, stops]

43:53.239 --> 43:55.545
So, I don't understand.

43:55.589 --> 43:58.287
-The malware only attacks here?-And only

43:58.331 --> 44:00.072
when I use the firm's Wi-Fi.

44:00.115 --> 44:04.032
So someone here
is trying to freeze me out

44:04.076 --> 44:06.382
whenever I ask
"What is Memo 618?"

44:06.426 --> 44:07.688
No, not here.

44:07.732 --> 44:09.211
Then where?
