09:07.590 --> 09:09.810
is at the top of the...
"never gonna happen" list.

-BARRY: But...

09:11.942 --> 09:13.901
-it is.
-ROSALYN: The party is moving
further and further left

09:13.944 --> 09:15.685

09:15.729 --> 09:17.948
There are a lot of ideas
that were once inconceivable

09:17.992 --> 09:20.472
that are now... ordinary.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.083
LEAH:
But this is really far left.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.085
There are a lot
of black conservatives--

09:24.128 --> 09:26.000
maybe not Republican
conservative,

09:26.043 --> 09:28.437
but definitely not
AOC progressive--

09:28.480 --> 09:30.047
and we don't want
to alienate them.

09:30.091 --> 09:32.441
And how exactly
do we make reparations happen,

09:32.484 --> 09:33.964
-practically?
-JAY: Just 'cause
it's complicated

09:34.008 --> 09:35.618

-doesn't mean
we throw up our hands

09:35.662 --> 09:36.924

-But we should...

-Do you have a minute?
-For?

Sure. Sure.

09:57.684 --> 09:58.641
Thank you.

10:01.122 --> 10:03.951

No, nothing.
Uh, Liz has a...

10:14.788 --> 10:17.181
dark sense of humor.

10:17.225 --> 10:19.749
I have a dark sense of humor.
Tell me.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.491
I was just joking

10:22.534 --> 10:25.494

10:29.106 --> 10:31.718

Anyway, please, come sit.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.817
[takes deep breath]

10:47.559 --> 10:49.692
Uh, you wanted to see us?

10:49.736 --> 10:50.911
Yes.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.698
A young man...

10:55.742 --> 10:57.657
begged a Zen master

10:57.700 --> 10:59.876
to teach him the way of truth.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.183
So the master took
the young man by the neck,

11:02.226 --> 11:06.927
dragged him to a stream,
stuck his head underwater.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.972
The young man gasped and fought,

11:09.016 --> 11:12.193
but the master held him
underwater for a full minute.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.674
And then,
just at the brink of death,

11:14.717 --> 11:17.677
he pulled him up
out of the water and asked,

11:17.720 --> 11:21.768
"What did you want most of all
when you were underwater?"

11:21.811 --> 11:25.206
"Air," the young man said.

11:25.249 --> 11:26.860
-Hmm?
-Yeah.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.862
"Well, good,"
the master responded.

11:28.905 --> 11:32.604
"Come back when you want truth
as much as air."

11:39.786 --> 11:41.962
You-you want us to want truth?

11:42.005 --> 11:44.312
That is one way to look at it.

11:44.355 --> 11:47.054
You have the Democratic
Committee as a client?

11:47.097 --> 11:49.883
-We do.
-You're working with them now?

11:49.926 --> 11:51.232
Yes.

11:51.275 --> 11:53.060
And you listed this
as a continuation

11:53.103 --> 11:56.237
of an old case?

11:56.280 --> 11:58.021
Is that a problem?

11:58.065 --> 12:00.676
Only if, in fact,
it's a new case.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.809
I think I'm missing something.
Why does that matter?

12:02.852 --> 12:05.942
Cases prior to the mergerare split 60/40 in favor of RBL.

12:05.986 --> 12:09.772
New business is split 40/60
in favor of STR Laurie.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.774
LIZ:
First of all, how do you know

12:11.818 --> 12:12.949
what we're billing the DNC?

12:12.993 --> 12:15.038
-It's irrelevant.
-No.

12:15.082 --> 12:17.258
No, it's not.
We-we have a two-year

12:17.301 --> 12:19.042
grace period
where we do not look

12:19.086 --> 12:22.742
at each other's books...
to encourage trust.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.353
So how did you get access
to our books?

12:25.396 --> 12:28.095
Trust is why I wanted
to speak with you first.

12:28.138 --> 12:32.795
Is the Democratic Committee
new business or old business?

12:36.799 --> 12:38.366
Old business.

12:38.409 --> 12:40.324
Good.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.065
That is all I needed to know.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.766
Eh? Trust.

12:48.419 --> 12:51.292
So... is it new business?

12:54.904 --> 12:56.863
I could argue it both ways.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.647
And we argued it in our favor.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.954
That is perfectly reasonable,
but the bigger worry

13:00.997 --> 13:02.651
is, how did he know?

13:02.694 --> 13:03.957
He's got a spy.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.306
A spy looking at our books?

13:05.349 --> 13:06.829
That's my guess.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.178
-Who?
-I don't know.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.659
Let's put Marissa on this.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.400
Okay, I'll talk to her.

13:12.443 --> 13:16.360
Um, Adrian, do you have a minutefor a question?

13:16.404 --> 13:19.276
Sure, but it's... old business.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.974
Oh, no, no.

13:21.017 --> 13:25.152
I went to Julius aboutthe missing Tecades injunction,

13:25.195 --> 13:28.285
and he told me if I wanted
to know where it went,

13:28.329 --> 13:31.201
to ask Adrian's girlfriend.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.335
What?

13:34.378 --> 13:37.860
He said, ask your girlfriend,
so let me ask.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.340
Who is your girlfriend,

13:39.383 --> 13:41.864
and why does she know
about my disappearing case?

13:41.908 --> 13:43.866
Julius.

13:46.042 --> 13:48.915
He's probably saying something
to pass the buck.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.267
What buck? What is going on?

13:53.310 --> 13:55.095
Why do I feel like

13:55.138 --> 13:57.706
I'm hearing passwords
in a secret society?

13:57.749 --> 14:00.491
There's no secret society,
Diane.

14:04.974 --> 14:08.978
I'm in a relationship
with a judge.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.893
Now, it is not improper,

14:10.937 --> 14:13.374
and there are certainly
no ex parte conversations.

14:13.417 --> 14:17.769
I just don't like my private
life being made public.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.816
Now you know
that information is power.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.383
And you lose information
to other people,

14:22.426 --> 14:24.994
then you give them
all the power over you.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.388
All right, so without telling methe judge's name,

14:27.431 --> 14:31.479
can you tell me what he meant by"Ask herabout the injunction"?

14:31.522 --> 14:33.829
All I can tell you
is what I heard.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.918
Which was?

14:35.962 --> 14:38.921
Memo 618.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.184
What is that?

14:41.228 --> 14:43.099
I don't know.

14:43.143 --> 14:46.929
I just know that Julius was
really intimidated

14:46.973 --> 14:50.150
by something given
to him called "Memo 618."

14:51.194 --> 14:53.066
That's it. That's all.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.764
-But you don't know what it is?-No.

what happened to your case,

He was an old
Chicago Police commander.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.732
Tortured over 100 black men,

19:28.776 --> 19:30.430
so the city of Chicago
passed an ordinance

19:30.473 --> 19:34.085

giving monetary damages

19:34.129 --> 19:36.044
to the survivors' families,

19:36.087 --> 19:39.265
and then,
they made a history curriculum

19:39.308 --> 19:41.267
about Burge mandatory

19:41.310 --> 19:43.791
to middle
and high school students.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.793
There's your model right there.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.795
And the white vote is gonna say,

19:47.838 --> 19:49.753
"None of us were alive
when slavery happened."

32:05.880 --> 32:09.318
It shouldn't feel like going
to HR is crossing enemy lines.

32:09.362 --> 32:12.974
-We're all
on the same side here.
-But only HR disciplines.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.933
Because people need to feel safein their working environment

32:14.976 --> 32:16.499
and know that
there will be consequences

32:16.543 --> 32:18.501
-for poor behavior.
-Mm.

32:18.545 --> 32:21.374
And a black person using
the N-word is poor behavior?

32:22.375 --> 32:24.029
We're investigating the context.

32:24.072 --> 32:26.988
Well, I fall on the "nosnitching" end of the spectrum.

32:27.032 --> 32:30.426
And I realize
that can be dangerous.

32:30.470 --> 32:34.996
The last thing we want here
is a culture of silence.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.737
What did you think
of the incident?

32:36.780 --> 32:38.478
I didn't think of it
as an incident.

32:38.521 --> 32:40.001
EDIE:
What did you think of it as?

32:40.045 --> 32:41.698
I didn't think of it
as anything.

32:41.742 --> 32:43.744
You report directly
to Adrian Boseman, right?

32:43.787 --> 32:45.354
I report to a lot of people.

32:45.398 --> 32:48.009
I just wanted to clarify
that there is no risk

32:48.053 --> 32:50.359
of anything you say
getting back to him.

32:50.403 --> 32:53.754
Had you ever heard Adrian
Boseman use the N-word before?

32:53.797 --> 32:56.452
It's possible.
I'm not keeping count.

32:56.496 --> 32:57.845
And what was the content

32:57.888 --> 32:59.542
of the story
Mr. Boseman told you?

32:59.586 --> 33:01.414
-You can summarize.
-[Jay exhales]

33:01.457 --> 33:03.024
I don't think I can summarize,

33:03.068 --> 33:04.895
actually.

33:04.939 --> 33:07.028
It's the only thing
that did offend me,

33:07.072 --> 33:08.987
so I remember it pretty clearly.

33:09.030 --> 33:12.381
The governor of Georgia
actually said on the radio,

33:12.425 --> 33:14.905
"I have two planks
in my platform.

33:14.949 --> 33:17.734
"Niggers and roads.

33:17.778 --> 33:20.128
"I'm against the first

33:20.172 --> 33:22.174
and for the second."

33:33.924 --> 33:35.752
Hey. What's up?

33:35.796 --> 33:38.581
I, uh, found out something
you can use.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.714
Something I can use?
I don't understand.

33:40.757 --> 33:43.586
You think I spied
on you guys, right?

33:43.630 --> 33:45.414
-No. I...
-Marissa, listen.

33:45.458 --> 33:48.156
Frank Landau is buddy-buddy
with Gavin upstairs.

33:48.200 --> 33:51.203
He's the one who told Gavin
it's a new case.

33:53.074 --> 33:55.598
I didn't need to know that.

33:55.642 --> 33:57.992
Yeah, but now you do.

34:00.603 --> 34:02.431
[phone rings]

34:02.475 --> 34:03.998
Hello.

34:05.782 --> 34:07.654
Mr. Jordan.

34:07.697 --> 34:09.482
How are you?

34:16.141 --> 34:18.186
Is that right?

34:20.623 --> 34:22.930
So, you dragged Vernon Jordan
into this?

34:22.973 --> 34:24.714
Adrian,
you'll have to start again.

34:24.758 --> 34:27.761
-What are you talking about?
-HR called Vernon Jordan.

34:27.804 --> 34:30.068
Investigating me
for the capital crime

34:30.111 --> 34:32.461
[laughs]:
of using the N-word.

34:32.505 --> 34:33.941
Well, unfortunately,
I can't stand in the way

34:33.984 --> 34:35.203
of an HR investigation.

34:35.247 --> 34:36.900
Oh, this is
a bullshit investigation.

34:36.944 --> 34:39.207
It's not a bullshit
investigation.

34:39.251 --> 34:41.775
It is our standard
to thoroughly explore

34:41.818 --> 34:44.082
any legitimate
employee complaint.

34:44.125 --> 34:45.822
This is not legitimate!

34:47.911 --> 34:51.089
Now, I understand,
you need to cover your ass.

34:51.132 --> 34:54.831
But you and I both know
this is far from legitimate.

34:54.875 --> 34:59.097
Well, what I know is that
you're aware of the rules.

34:59.140 --> 35:01.621
You didn't sign your contract
that long ago.

35:01.664 --> 35:03.927
STR Laurie and all its divisions

35:03.971 --> 35:06.582
has a zero tolerance policy

35:06.626 --> 35:09.150
for offensive language
and harassment at work.

35:09.194 --> 35:11.805
Harassment.
Wow, wow, it's-it's...

35:11.848 --> 35:13.154
it's growing now, huh?

35:13.198 --> 35:15.156
I got into this
with human resources,

35:15.200 --> 35:17.854
and they think that
the best course of action now

35:17.898 --> 35:19.682
is for everyone
at Reddick/Boseman

35:19.726 --> 35:22.120
to take a class on sensitivity

35:22.163 --> 35:24.165
in the workplace.

35:24.209 --> 35:28.169
And we'd prefer if you
didn't use that word again

35:28.213 --> 35:29.866
at the office.

35:29.910 --> 35:31.564
You would prefer?

35:31.607 --> 35:34.741
Adrian, consideringthe charged nature of that word,

35:34.784 --> 35:36.743
it would be best.

35:38.266 --> 35:40.964
You don't dictate

35:41.008 --> 35:43.706
which words I get to use...

35:43.750 --> 35:45.578
or when.

35:57.938 --> 36:00.158
What if I quit?

36:00.201 --> 36:01.681
Okay.

36:01.724 --> 36:03.857
Call the movers...

36:03.900 --> 36:06.076
and rent an office.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.209
[groans]

36:08.253 --> 36:10.559
Maybe take out an ad.

36:10.603 --> 36:12.953
Don't be so sure
I won't walk, Liz.

36:15.216 --> 36:17.610
I have done it before.

36:18.611 --> 36:20.047
I'm the one who walked.

36:20.090 --> 36:22.049
Only because...

36:22.092 --> 36:24.138
I made it impossible
for you to stay.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.706
Only because I pushed you to it.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.232
Oh, God, just take the class.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.930
Just do what they want
and move forward.

36:33.974 --> 36:35.758
I mean,
you know what the game is.

36:35.802 --> 36:37.847
You know how to play it.

36:38.848 --> 36:40.894
Or don't play it.

36:40.937 --> 36:42.200
This is exhausting.

36:42.243 --> 36:44.245
Just... fuck the class.
Do what you want.

36:44.289 --> 36:47.117
-Hmm.
-What are they gonna do?

36:47.161 --> 36:50.251
Are they really gonna fire theirmost senior black male employee

36:50.295 --> 36:52.949
because he used the N-word
in a quote?

36:52.993 --> 36:54.821
Yeah, it sounds
even more ridiculous

36:54.864 --> 36:56.823
when I say it out loud.

36:56.866 --> 36:59.695
And-and don't forget
about that photo.

36:59.739 --> 37:01.175
What photo?

37:01.219 --> 37:04.178
Couple of years ago,
they took that class picture

37:04.222 --> 37:06.615
of their 40 new hires,
and someone online posted

37:06.659 --> 37:08.878
that there wasn't
a single black face in it.

37:08.922 --> 37:11.403
And then they photoshopped in
three black faces.

37:12.404 --> 37:13.883
[Adrian chuckles]

37:13.927 --> 37:15.798
They really did that.

37:15.842 --> 37:18.236
They bought us
to put us in their pictures.

37:18.279 --> 37:21.326
Oh, makes me feel warm all over.

37:21.369 --> 37:24.720
Well, the good news is
that they need us.

37:24.764 --> 37:26.374
Not-not just the floor.

37:26.418 --> 37:28.158
They need us.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.160
So do what you want.

37:30.204 --> 37:32.685
'Cause they ain't gonna fire us.

37:33.686 --> 37:34.904
Hmm.

37:38.212 --> 37:40.345
-Excuse me.
-Yeah. Jay.

37:41.346 --> 37:42.825
[clears throat]
Okay.

37:42.869 --> 37:45.828
I think we should put it
on the table.

37:45.872 --> 37:48.004
-Put what on the table?
-It's uncomfortable

37:48.048 --> 37:50.006
to pretend that someone
didn't violate the space,

37:50.050 --> 37:51.660
so let's just talk about it.

37:51.704 --> 37:53.923
-Who filed the complaint?
-Jay, that is

37:53.967 --> 37:56.012
-completely inappropriate.
-How can we have
an honest conversation

37:56.056 --> 37:58.232
about reparations and the thingsblack people in this country

37:58.276 --> 38:00.321
have experienced
when we're tiptoeing around

38:00.365 --> 38:02.236
how this complaint
is being handled?

38:02.280 --> 38:03.846
MADELINE:
Everyone in this room,

38:03.890 --> 38:06.022
at this firm,
has the right to go to HR

38:06.066 --> 38:08.286
as they see fit,
without fear of retribution.

38:08.329 --> 38:10.679
-I'm not talking about payback.-ADRIAN: Okay, Jay, I don't

38:10.723 --> 38:12.333
-need you to
fight this battle for me.
-It's not for you.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.683
I think we all have
a right to know.

38:14.727 --> 38:17.164
Oh, come on,
I'd rather cut my wrists

38:17.207 --> 38:19.253
-than go to HR willingly.
-MICAH: What kills me

38:19.297 --> 38:21.211
is that this company
is more concerned

38:21.255 --> 38:22.822
about making sure that they seem

38:22.865 --> 38:24.824
racially sensitive
instead of actually being

38:24.867 --> 38:27.348
-racially sensitive.
-LEAH: Yeah,
that quote was heartbreaking.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.394
And the only thing
that person got from it

38:29.437 --> 38:31.047
was that a bad word was said?

38:31.091 --> 38:33.049
-This looks intense.
-Yeah. Welcome.

38:33.093 --> 38:34.877
JAY:
Yes, it's a violent word

38:34.921 --> 38:36.749
with a violent history.

38:36.792 --> 38:39.229
But black people reckon with itevery day.

38:39.273 --> 38:40.927
It's ourword.

38:40.970 --> 38:42.798
If we use it,
if we don't use it,

38:42.842 --> 38:44.147
when we use, where we use it--

38:44.191 --> 38:45.714
you don't get to have
an opinion.

38:45.758 --> 38:47.847
Autonomy over that word

38:47.890 --> 38:50.197
-is our reparations.
-DAVID: Then good.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.721
-You don't need
us white people here anymore.-ADRIAN: Just wait, wait, wait.

38:52.765 --> 38:54.201
DAVID:
No, you heard him.

38:54.244 --> 38:56.029
-He doesn't want us here.
-I think we should go back

38:56.072 --> 38:57.683
-to the original group
on this project.
-MARISSA: Hang on a second.

38:57.726 --> 38:59.728
You don't know for sure that itwas a white person who snitched.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.730
-It could have been anyone.
-Yeah, well, I think we know

39:01.774 --> 39:03.079
who the most likely
suspects are.

39:03.123 --> 39:05.212
-Go to hell, lady.
-Whoa.

39:05.255 --> 39:06.344
[all clamoring]

39:06.387 --> 39:08.215
Hey. Show some respect.

39:08.258 --> 39:10.391
ROSALYN:
I agree with Jay.
This conversation

39:10.435 --> 39:11.914
has completely derailed
ever since we changed

39:11.958 --> 39:14.743
-the group dynamics.
-ADRIAN: It's still important

39:14.787 --> 39:17.006
to get different perspectives
and points of view.

39:17.050 --> 39:18.399
But clearly, there's a limit.

39:18.443 --> 39:19.792
-There's always limits.
-And the person

39:19.835 --> 39:21.402
who alwaysgets
to draw the line,

39:21.446 --> 39:24.753
regardless of race, isthe person with the most power.

39:24.797 --> 39:28.366
Adrian, you hold the power
in this room and out of it.

39:28.409 --> 39:31.760
Sometimes people have to find
alternative ways to level

39:31.804 --> 39:32.979
the playing field.

39:33.022 --> 39:34.807
And that's
exactly why departments

39:34.850 --> 39:37.287
like human resources exist.

39:37.331 --> 39:39.899
So... you filed the complaint?

39:39.942 --> 39:42.423
-Don't answer that.
He has no right to ask.
-MADELINE: It doesn't matter

39:42.467 --> 39:46.384
who filed it, and I don't care
who the N-word belongs to.

39:46.427 --> 39:49.169
Every black person should have
the choice not to hear it

39:49.212 --> 39:51.780
in their workplace
if they don't want to.

39:51.824 --> 39:54.392
Especially
when it's literally part

39:54.435 --> 39:56.306
of the employer's policy.

39:56.350 --> 39:58.004
We can all come up with reasons

39:58.047 --> 40:00.136
why we don't want
to hear the word.

40:00.180 --> 40:03.226
But when it comes down to it,
you're confronting the past,

40:03.270 --> 40:05.315
-and it's painful.
-JAY: And there's
no avoiding it.

40:05.359 --> 40:08.144
So we're supposed to confront
the past between depositions?

40:08.188 --> 40:10.016
Perhaps some of us would prefer

40:10.059 --> 40:12.322
to do our emotional
heavy lifting

40:12.366 --> 40:14.499
outside the office.

40:14.542 --> 40:17.980
Madeline, we could have talked
about this privately.

40:18.024 --> 40:20.374
There was no reason
to go upstairs.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.158
Oh, you want special treatment

40:22.202 --> 40:24.465
because you're
a big-name partner?

40:24.509 --> 40:27.816
Well, the people upstairs are
the big names now, and I think

40:27.860 --> 40:30.819
we should follow the rules
of the firm you made us join.

40:30.863 --> 40:33.822
If you filed the complaint,
at least own it.

40:33.866 --> 40:36.477
Jay, I know
you don't see it this way,

40:36.521 --> 40:38.914
but this little stunt
you pulled...

40:38.958 --> 40:40.916
it's called intimidation.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.832
[loud, overlapping chatter]

40:43.876 --> 40:45.834
ADRIAN:
I know it's a bit heated.

40:45.878 --> 40:47.488
-More than heated.
-We have a lot

40:47.532 --> 40:49.838
of intensely passionate people
on our team,

40:49.882 --> 40:52.014
and their opinions
are unwavering.

40:52.058 --> 40:54.147
And it's
a difficult subject matter.

40:54.190 --> 40:57.585
Listen, everyone at the DNC
applauds your innovation.

40:57.629 --> 41:00.022
You've obviously chosen
the most off-beaten path.

41:00.066 --> 41:02.416
We're just not sure this is
the right direction for us.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.504
Thanks for your efforts.

41:03.548 --> 41:04.940
-Frank...
-Thanks, Adrian.

41:09.336 --> 41:12.208
Tim and Marcus
are ordering lunch.

41:12.252 --> 41:15.516
Tim teases Marcus about
how much he loves watermelon.

41:15.560 --> 41:19.128
He accuses Marcus
of having a sticky keyboard,

41:19.172 --> 41:23.089
and after a few coworkers laugh,they move on with their day.

41:23.132 --> 41:25.265
Who would say that was
a goodinteraction?

41:27.093 --> 41:30.575
Okay. Who would say that was
an uncomfortable situation?

41:34.361 --> 41:37.233
Who would say
that was unacceptable?

41:37.277 --> 41:39.975
I didn't know we could choose
worse than uncomfortable.

41:40.019 --> 41:41.411
Can I change my vote?

41:41.455 --> 41:43.065
You didn't raise your hand.

41:43.109 --> 41:45.198
We need everyone to participate.

41:45.241 --> 41:46.939
I don't know Marcus.

41:46.982 --> 41:49.202
Maybe he really likes
watermelon.

41:49.245 --> 41:51.552
Maybe Tim was correct
in his commentary.

41:51.596 --> 41:53.554
Marcus does not eat watermelon.

41:53.598 --> 41:55.338
Then Tim is a racist.

41:55.382 --> 41:57.079
[soft laughter]

41:59.386 --> 42:02.563
Karly and Marie are touching uptheir hair in the bathroom...

42:02.607 --> 42:04.913
-You're in a mood.
-This is bullshit.

42:04.957 --> 42:06.959
Welcome to corporate America.

42:07.002 --> 42:09.091
-We all have to do it.
-Not everyone.

42:09.135 --> 42:11.093
No, everyone.

42:11.137 --> 42:13.922
You see Adrian, Liz, Diane?

42:13.966 --> 42:16.185
They still have to do it.

42:16.229 --> 42:19.014
Just not with the peasants.

42:35.378 --> 42:36.641
[knock on door]

42:37.685 --> 42:39.600
You needed me, Ms. Reddick?

42:39.644 --> 42:42.211
-Yes. Caleb, right?
-Right.

42:42.255 --> 42:45.650
I just wanted to thank you
for helping us out upstairs.

42:45.693 --> 42:48.348
Sure. Just doing my job.

42:48.391 --> 42:50.959
And if there's anything
you need from us,

42:51.003 --> 42:53.135
just tell me.

42:53.179 --> 42:54.659
Okay.

42:54.702 --> 42:57.183
Good.

43:01.013 --> 43:02.667
Yes?

43:02.710 --> 43:04.582
Second chair.

43:04.625 --> 43:06.105
On?

43:06.148 --> 43:09.238
Anything. I'm here to learn.

43:09.282 --> 43:12.590
Then we'll do our best to teach.

43:16.681 --> 43:18.726
Okay.

43:28.040 --> 43:30.172
[knock on door]

43:30.216 --> 43:32.000
-What's wrong?
-I don't know,

43:32.044 --> 43:33.654
but this is weird.

43:33.698 --> 43:36.352
I went to the same website,
Bar-Swarm,

43:36.396 --> 43:38.137
using my home Wi-Fi.

43:38.180 --> 43:39.747
And...

43:39.791 --> 43:41.662
DIANE:
No rejection of service?

43:41.706 --> 43:44.012
Right. There's no malware
at home. But watch.

43:44.056 --> 43:46.798
I'm on the office Wi-Fi now.

43:48.451 --> 43:49.670
[high-pitched beeping]

43:49.714 --> 43:53.195
[beeping slows, stops]

43:53.239 --> 43:55.545
So, I don't understand.

43:55.589 --> 43:58.287
-The malware only attacks here?-And only

43:58.331 --> 44:00.072
when I use the firm's Wi-Fi.

44:00.115 --> 44:04.032
So someone here
is trying to freeze me out

44:04.076 --> 44:06.382
whenever I ask
"What is Memo 618?"

44:06.426 --> 44:07.688
No, not here.

44:07.732 --> 44:09.211
Then where?
