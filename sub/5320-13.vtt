WEBVTT

00:13.279 --> 00:15.281
Greetings, members of
the league! Remember last week

00:15.315 --> 00:17.150
when I ran into a former flame?

00:17.183 --> 00:19.720
Well, it was that night I made
a very important decision.

00:19.753 --> 00:22.723
I never want to be
without you again.
Mmm.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.224
RUXIN:
Oh, no, Andre,
what are you

00:24.257 --> 00:25.759
about to do?
So we went to Mexico

00:25.792 --> 00:27.694
and tied the knot!
We went to Mexico
and tied the knot!

00:27.728 --> 00:29.262
Wait, what?
(Andre laughs)

00:29.295 --> 00:31.164
Yeah!
I'm Mrs. Meegan Nowzick!

00:31.197 --> 00:33.099
And I don't really
hate it that much.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.701
The name, I mean.
TACO: Wow.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.236
I could've notarized it.
You know

00:36.269 --> 00:38.138
Venezuela's different
than Mexico, right?
How so?

00:38.171 --> 00:40.106
But right now, it's all about

00:40.140 --> 00:42.075
my lady.
That's me.

00:42.108 --> 00:45.145
And bam! Bam!
Baby.

00:45.178 --> 00:47.113
I never thought I would be
embarrassed for Vanilla Ice

00:47.147 --> 00:49.149
to be associated
with something.

00:49.182 --> 00:51.652
♪ Why don't you join us
in a dance where you are? ♪

00:51.685 --> 00:54.721
♪ We are robots
who are in love. ♪
(groaning)

00:54.755 --> 00:56.657
Can a baby miscarry itself?

00:56.690 --> 00:59.059
♪ ♪

01:02.295 --> 01:03.764
Check it out.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.633
Oh. Jesus, Taco, what
the hell happened?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.401
You know,
just normal wear and tear.

01:08.434 --> 01:10.436
This is not normal
wear and tear.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.238
Well, also, the pony
knocked over a lava lamp.

01:12.272 --> 01:13.774
There was a fire...

01:13.807 --> 01:15.141
The pony caught the
place on fire?
No, no, no.

01:15.175 --> 01:16.677
The pony caught himself on fire.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.746
This was from smoking in a bed.
Was that you, Taco?

01:19.780 --> 01:21.782
No, it was the pony. Aren't you
listening to what I'm saying?

01:21.815 --> 01:24.150
Anyway, now all I have
to do is get insurance,

01:24.184 --> 01:25.619
and I'm gonna make a fortune.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.588
Uh, it doesn't really work
that way.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.255
It's all part of my master plan.

01:29.289 --> 01:30.791
Step one
of the master plan:

01:30.824 --> 01:33.193
burn down the EBDBBnB.
Step two:

01:33.226 --> 01:35.529
vanish without a trace.
Why?

01:35.562 --> 01:38.364
Can't tell you, Jenny. I wish
I could, but I don't trust you.

01:38.398 --> 01:40.133
Can you believe it?

01:40.166 --> 01:41.467
Soon, the EBDBBnB
will be closing its doors.

01:41.502 --> 01:44.871
What? Taco, you have
people in there.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.372
TACO:
Hey, guys, watch out

01:46.406 --> 01:48.609
for the hole in the floor
while you're having sex!

01:48.642 --> 01:51.277
It's real dangerous in there.
You want to come up?

01:51.311 --> 01:53.246
Ew. What? No.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.715
Not with me,
with strangers.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.617
Oh, God, Taco.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.351
All right, I'm going in.

01:58.384 --> 02:00.721
JENNY: The rules of
the Fertility Bowl are simple:

02:00.754 --> 02:03.690
when I win, Kevin has said
he's gonna get a vasectomy.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.692
And when I win, she's
gonna get her tubes tied.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.160
Oh, boy.

02:07.193 --> 02:08.328
KEVIN: But this is
a very serious issue,

02:08.361 --> 02:09.663
so we're gonna try to be

02:09.696 --> 02:11.164
mature about it.
Yeah.

02:11.197 --> 02:12.566
And that's why
I made a trophy.

02:12.599 --> 02:15.335
Let me introduce you
to the Snip.

02:15.368 --> 02:18.171
Look at this.
That's a real trophy, babe.
Oh, yeah.

02:18.204 --> 02:20.473
Your name's gonna go right here
for the rest of eternity.

02:20.507 --> 02:21.508
We'll see about that.

02:21.542 --> 02:22.743
Never run with the Snip.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.244
Be careful on the stairs.

02:24.277 --> 02:25.846
Carry the Snip
with the sharp end down.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.347
KEVIN: I don't really care
for this thing.

02:27.380 --> 02:28.381
Then why didn't you make
your own trophy?

02:28.414 --> 02:29.650
I was going to,
but the trophy place

02:29.683 --> 02:30.884
didn't have
plastic ovaries.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.352
That's disgusting.
I know.

02:32.385 --> 02:33.887
That's what the old lady
that worked there said.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.556
KEVIN: Wow.
ANDRE: We're so excited

02:35.589 --> 02:37.658
you guys are here.
You guys.
This is great.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.259
What is it exactly?
ANDRE: Oh, it's a

02:39.292 --> 02:42.228
baby gender party.
It is a baby gender party.

02:42.262 --> 02:43.730
So it's a baby shower?
MEEGAN and ANDRE:
No.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.265
You have to buy other presents
the next time.
No.

02:45.298 --> 02:46.432
Yeah, we'll have
a shower registry,

02:46.466 --> 02:47.868
and this is the
gender registry.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.402
I need a cocktail.
Yes.

02:49.435 --> 02:51.437
Oh, we have boy cocktails
and girl cocktails,

02:51.471 --> 02:53.507
so if you want a boy,
pick a blue cocktail;
if you want a girl,

02:53.540 --> 02:54.875
pick a pink cocktail.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.276
I'll just mix a little
of both in a glass

02:56.309 --> 02:57.343
and call it an Andre.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.312
That's what he's been doing
all day.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.313
(laughter)

03:00.346 --> 03:01.682
Great. Okay.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.217
I mean, how are they gonna
baby‐proof this joint?

03:04.250 --> 03:05.752
Well, Andre already
people‐proofed it.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.789
Ooh. Anyone gonna take a hit
off of Kevin's pubes?

03:08.822 --> 03:10.290
Mm. I don't smoke
the red stuff, thanks.

03:10.323 --> 03:12.292
Hey, uh, Pete,
what'd you get Andre?

03:12.325 --> 03:14.861
Uh, nothing. Why?
What are you talking about?
You got to get him something

03:14.895 --> 03:17.297
extra special. You guys
are Eskimo husbands.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.332
While it's true we've spelunked
in the same cave,

03:19.365 --> 03:21.234
only I left something behind.

03:21.267 --> 03:23.369
Ew.
That's so gross.
What, like a broken headlamp?

03:23.403 --> 03:25.639
Oh, hold that thought.
Everybody!

03:25.672 --> 03:27.608
I have a very important
announcement, everyone.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.409
Now, I know you think today's
party can't get any better.

03:29.442 --> 03:31.277
No one thought that.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.914
Uh‐oh. What's that?
(harmonizing)

03:33.947 --> 03:36.282
Oh. I think
they're gonna sing.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.952
I've reunited my college
a cappella group, the Dre Tones,

03:38.985 --> 03:40.420
and we're
gonna bring
Oh, no.

03:40.453 --> 03:42.823

Yeah.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.697
The Dre Tones!
You guys remember
the Dre Tones.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.498
I know that you were busy for
the shows that you were supposed

04:25.532 --> 04:27.534
to come see, but I figured
if you couldn't come to them,

04:27.568 --> 04:29.035
they could come to you.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.537
Anyway, I'd like to say
a few words, if I may.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.005
Oh, my gosh. Taco
with a speech.
Speech!

04:32.038 --> 04:33.540
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
First speech!

04:33.574 --> 04:34.941
Andre, Meegan,

04:34.975 --> 04:36.476
this has nothing
to do with you.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.712
Everyone, I want
you all to know

04:38.745 --> 04:41.682
that I am going
to mysteriously vanish,

04:41.715 --> 04:43.349
and I want you
to know why.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.686
I have been
summoned to court.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.454
I knew that one day
it'd catch up to me. Yeah.

04:48.488 --> 04:51.525
They want to put me on trial.
They want me to fry.

04:51.558 --> 04:52.959
No, they want you
to be on a jury.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.328
You can't be on a jury
and tried at the same time.

04:55.361 --> 04:56.663
That's not how it works,
dum‐dum.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.364
I thought you
were a lawyer.
No, you don't...

04:58.398 --> 04:59.733
Just...
What?

04:59.766 --> 05:02.869
Taco, what exactly
are you on trial for?

05:02.903 --> 05:04.505
Did you guys never ask
yourselves,

05:04.538 --> 05:06.640
"How does he maintain
this decadent lifestyle?"

05:06.673 --> 05:08.509
The bicycles,

05:08.542 --> 05:10.376
the vintage suits, the used van?

05:10.410 --> 05:12.546
We pay for
all of that.
That's us.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.414
The spear gun?
Us.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.550
I guess we really just didn't
want to know the truth.

05:16.583 --> 05:17.483
I appreciate that, Ruspin.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.484
So I guess

05:18.519 --> 05:19.485
this is good‐bye.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.554
All right, bye. Later.

05:20.587 --> 05:21.588
I love you, guy...

05:21.622 --> 05:23.524
Well, I don't love y...

05:23.557 --> 05:27.360
What's just below like
and above dislike?

05:27.393 --> 05:28.662
Neutral?

05:28.695 --> 05:29.863
I neutral you guys.

05:29.896 --> 05:31.665
Andre, I neutral
you less.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.099
So more towards like?

05:33.133 --> 05:35.435
TACO: So I'm gonna
vanish right...

05:35.468 --> 05:36.537
now.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.872
Poof. Smoke.

05:38.905 --> 05:39.906
This is crazy.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.775
No. Let him go.

05:41.808 --> 05:43.409
Vanishing! Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

05:43.443 --> 05:46.780
I'll take some of that.
Vanishing food. Mmm.

05:46.813 --> 05:49.449
And just like that,
he mysteriously vanished.

05:49.482 --> 05:50.684
Vanishing!

05:50.717 --> 05:52.519
ANDRE:
Well, everybody, let's not

05:52.553 --> 05:56.456
let one vanishing wreck a whole
afternoon of a cappella fun.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.458
Oh, no. Let's just have
one more vanishing.

05:58.491 --> 05:59.593
What? No. No, no more vanishing.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.628
Poof! Smoke.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.597
And you made a
pitch pipe appear!
(gasps)

06:03.630 --> 06:04.798
MEEGAN:
Magic!

06:04.831 --> 06:05.599

Andre is so sexy.

06:28.855 --> 06:29.990
Hmm.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.425
So, when does the
little pumpkin drop?

06:32.458 --> 06:33.760
Labor Day.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.529
When did you guys
break up again?

06:35.562 --> 06:36.563
Mm...

06:36.597 --> 06:38.665
Oh, I remember.
You guys broke up

06:38.699 --> 06:39.933
around the Beer Mile.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.702
That was week four
of the NFL season,

06:41.735 --> 06:44.037
'cause C. J. Spiller was on
my bench, and he killed it.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.639
And you said the baby
was due Labor Day.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.207
Yeah.
Most people
don't know this,

06:47.240 --> 06:49.576
but a baby actually gestates
for ten months.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.644
I know. Don't remind me.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.546
(chuckles)
But that means

06:52.579 --> 06:54.715
the baby would have been
conceived at the end of October,

06:54.748 --> 06:56.216
not the beginning
of October,

06:56.249 --> 06:58.552
around week seven or
eight of the season.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.453
But you and Andre had broken up
at that point.

07:00.486 --> 07:02.856
I don't...
You know what, I'm probably

07:02.889 --> 07:04.457
mixing up my dates.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.560
The doctor was just throwing
a lot of numbers out at me...

07:06.593 --> 07:07.928
I got some week five

07:07.961 --> 07:10.597
problems here. You got
a problem there, too.

07:10.631 --> 07:11.932
Oh, it's nothing.
Don't worry about it. Yeah.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.233
Roethlisberger's out.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.135
So what do I do,
pick up Tyrod Taylor?
I mean,

07:15.168 --> 07:16.937
you can, but you'd never have
the balls to use him.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.471
Tyrod Taylor's
like buying a Bowflex.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.140
You're gonna buy it
'cause it looks good,

07:20.173 --> 07:21.608
and then you're like,
"I'm never gonna use this."

07:21.642 --> 07:23.544
Never use him.
(grunts)

07:23.577 --> 07:24.745
What is it, hemorrhoids?

07:24.778 --> 07:27.080
No, it's just a weird night.
Sleep.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.515
You know.
Hmm.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.253
MEEGAN: ...maybe could be
coming early or...

07:33.286 --> 07:35.756
It doesn't really matter, as
long as we have a healthy baby.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.558
Hey, Meegan.
Hmm?

07:37.591 --> 07:39.593
Can I guess
what sex the baby is?

07:39.626 --> 07:41.595
Sure.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.263
I think the sex...

07:43.296 --> 07:45.666
was with Pete.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.837
(chuckles):
Oh, man!

07:50.871 --> 07:54.007
Shark Ruxin, sniffing out
the blood in the water

07:54.040 --> 07:55.609
and chomping down on the truth!

07:55.642 --> 07:56.977
Please don't tell Andre.
It was one time.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.979
Does Pete know?
No!

07:59.012 --> 08:00.847
He doesn't know,
and he cannot know.

08:00.881 --> 08:01.848
Promise me

08:01.882 --> 08:03.517
he will not ever
find out.

08:03.550 --> 08:05.285
Keep that nasty finger
away from me.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.787
Please, please, Ruxin.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.722
Um, Meegan.
Meegan, come here.

08:08.755 --> 08:09.990
I‐I'll be right there, honey.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.925
Hold on. Promise me.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.193
Meegan.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.294
Ruxin, promise me.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.996
Come here, come here.
I'm coming, honey.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.632
(chuckles)
This is an amazing baby shower.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.201
It is now time to announce
the sex of the Nowzick baby.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.036
Is it a boy or
is it a girl?

08:23.069 --> 08:25.038
Mouth‐roll, please!

08:25.071 --> 08:27.040
♪ What's the sex? ♪
♪ What's the sex? ♪

08:27.073 --> 08:30.744
♪ What's the sex? ♪
♪ What's the sex? ♪

08:30.777 --> 08:32.613
(gasps)

08:32.646 --> 08:34.748
It's a boy!
It's a boy!

08:34.781 --> 08:36.182
(cheering)

08:42.055 --> 08:44.324
KEVIN: Between the Dre Tones
and the hummus,

08:44.357 --> 08:46.326
I'm gonna barf.
Does your stomach hurt?
What...? Is that...?

08:46.359 --> 08:47.828
Geez.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.630
Unbelievable.
Nice job vanishing, Taco.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.632
The only thing vanishing
are our deli meats.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.066
(sighs)
Hey, honey, I'm home.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.768
(chuckles)
Oh, my God. What is this,
a youth hostel?

08:54.801 --> 08:56.770
You guys look great.
Where you been?

08:56.803 --> 08:59.172
Out.
We were at Andre and
Meegan's baby shower.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.206
Don't tell him.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.675
She's pregnant?
JENNY: Yeah.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.710
Oh, God, I hope it's not mine.

09:03.744 --> 09:04.578
Why would it be yours, Rafi?

09:04.611 --> 09:05.646
I've been jacking down

09:05.679 --> 09:06.847
on their towels like crazy.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.248
You think that's how it works?
Yeah.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.717
She puts the towel on,
my biz gets on her leg‐‐

09:10.751 --> 09:11.818
swim, swim, swim.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.319
Next thing you know,
four months later,

09:13.353 --> 09:15.321
Baby Rafi comes out.
Well, congratulations

09:15.355 --> 09:16.657
if you're having a baby, Rafi.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.358
RAFI: No, I don't want
a baby with Meegan.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.661
Plus, if you must know, my
very serious girlfriend Margaret

09:20.694 --> 09:21.662
and I have been trying.

09:21.695 --> 09:22.929
Oh.
Oh.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.931
You and Margaret
are still together.
Yeah.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.600
But I don't know
if she can get pregnant or not.

09:26.633 --> 09:27.801
I'm starting to worry
she might be seedless.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.603
Either way,
it's... time to go.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.738
Cool.
So... you should be...

09:31.772 --> 09:33.607
No, no, no. I'm sleeping
back here, behind the couch.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.608
What?
Hmm?

09:34.641 --> 09:35.942
Why?
Because Margaret's

09:35.976 --> 09:37.811
already back there,
and I'm already hard.

09:37.844 --> 09:40.013
So you guys should probably
get out of here pretty quick.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.382
JENNY:
What? Oh.
KEVIN: Um...

09:42.415 --> 09:44.284
You know what,
you‐you might be right, Rafi.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.385
RAFI:
Cool.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.955
It's about to get weird!
(chuckles)

09:48.989 --> 09:51.091
You guys are welcome to stay and
watch. I'd love the audience.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.393
(screams)
Oh, my God!

09:53.426 --> 09:54.728
What?
(screams)

09:54.761 --> 09:55.829
No, no, no, no, no!

09:55.862 --> 09:57.097
Someone murdered Margaret!

09:57.130 --> 09:59.399
First Sofia,
now Margaret!

09:59.432 --> 10:01.968
Someone's murdering
the women that I love!

10:02.002 --> 10:04.237
We're just gonna go to bed now.
I think we should...

10:04.270 --> 10:05.405
(sobbing)

10:05.438 --> 10:07.407
One, two, three.
(exhales)

10:07.440 --> 10:08.775
Oh, baby.

10:08.809 --> 10:12.245
(exhales, grunts)
Mmm. Oh.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.715
One last time, baby.
Oh, this is the last time.

10:14.748 --> 10:15.916
Rafi, the remote...

10:15.949 --> 10:17.918
Huh? Don't judge me, Brian.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.419
I need you
to look at me, Brian.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.254
I need you to look at me
so I can finish, Brian!

10:21.287 --> 10:22.422
Oh, no.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.725
There are seeds!

10:24.758 --> 10:26.426
She was pregnant!

10:26.459 --> 10:30.263
Do I roll the dice
with Stefon Diggs or...

10:30.296 --> 10:33.399
do I play it safe

10:33.433 --> 10:35.135
with Allen Robinson?

10:35.168 --> 10:37.003
God, Andre's team is stacked.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.873
If I tell him about
Pete and Meegan, he'll implode.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.875
On the other hand...

10:41.908 --> 10:43.777
I'm such a good friend.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.812
I need a sign.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.247
(doorbell rings)

10:49.349 --> 10:51.451
Shiva?

10:51.484 --> 10:52.819
Rodney.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.788
I'm so sorry I didn't
come to the funeral.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.156
I was out of the country.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.791
No, no, no.
You're here now,

10:57.824 --> 10:59.760
and that's all that matters.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.027
SHIVA:
This is for you, Geoffrey.

11:01.061 --> 11:04.030
Oh, a baseball glove.
Thanks, The Shiva.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.199
Just "Shiva" is fine.

11:06.232 --> 11:08.201
Oh, you did great, buddy.
Hey, go upstairs.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.771
I'll tuck you in
in a bit, all right?
Okay.

11:12.138 --> 11:15.041
Oh, my gosh. I didn't know
what to get you, I'm sorry.

11:15.075 --> 11:19.212
Oh, Shiva,
your presence is a gift.

11:19.245 --> 11:21.047
Are you doing okay?

11:21.081 --> 11:22.716
Is there anything
I can do for you?

11:22.749 --> 11:25.118
Well, I mean,

11:25.151 --> 11:27.187
there's... one thing.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.188
What is this?

11:28.221 --> 11:29.923
This is my fantasy lineup.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.192
Okay, what do you want
me to do with this?

11:32.225 --> 11:33.393
I want you to bless it.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.795
What?

11:34.828 --> 11:36.129
A blessing from The Shiva.
Okay.

11:36.162 --> 11:38.331
Rodney, you know
that I'm just a girl

11:38.364 --> 11:39.833
you went to
high school with, right?

11:39.866 --> 11:41.067
I don't have magical powers,

11:41.101 --> 11:44.070
I can't help you win
a fake football league.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.238
I know it seems crazy, but...

11:45.271 --> 11:46.873
Is this really gonna help you?

11:46.907 --> 11:48.208
More than anything

11:48.241 --> 11:50.376
anyone has done for me
since my wife died.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.212
Okay.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.847
Specifically
in the wide receiver area.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.949
That's been a real bugaboo
this week.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.884
This is what I would do...

11:57.918 --> 12:00.220
Hey, you seen my pube trimmers?
Whoa.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.755
Who's this?
Shiva, Rafi.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.524
Wow. Very firm grip.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.759
You know what that means‐‐
super good hand jobs.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.761
RUXIN: Okay, Rafi,
that's enough.
Sorry to interrupt,

12:07.794 --> 12:09.896
but, uh, I just
can't help but feel like

12:09.930 --> 12:11.364
with Sofia only,
like, a month dead,

12:11.397 --> 12:13.033
it's a little early
for you to be dating.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.968
Oh, oh, no, no, no.
We're not dating.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.369
Oh, whatever
you call it‐‐

12:16.402 --> 12:18.171
like, finger‐blasting,
ass‐blasting.
No.

12:18.204 --> 12:19.506
Okay. Okay...
Kissing on the mouths:
upstairs, downstairs.

12:19.540 --> 12:21.241
Wide... wide receiver.
You know what?

12:21.274 --> 12:23.043
I'm just gonna go.
RAFI: Front to back,
top to bottom.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.845
Rodney... I'll
see you...
Swappin' poops, butt to butt.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.780
I'll see you next week.
No.

12:26.813 --> 12:28.048
Next week
is too late.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.516
(grunts)

12:29.550 --> 12:31.251
Ooh, you smell good.
What is that, McDonald's?

12:31.284 --> 12:32.553
Mmm. Wow.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.054
She's like a Big Mac.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.989
Shiva, just tell me
who to play at wide receiver!

12:36.022 --> 12:37.023
(door closes)

12:37.057 --> 12:38.291
Oh, Rafi,
you screwed it up.

12:38.324 --> 12:39.793
That was great.
You're welcome, man.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.127
You're welcome?
Yeah.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.262
No, you screwed me, Rafi.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.897
She was about
to bless my lineup.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.131
I'll bless your lineup.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.199
Is that what we're
talking about here? (spits)

12:46.232 --> 12:47.868
Yeah.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.135
Oh.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.971
There you go, bingo bango.
Blessed, Rafi‐style.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.445
RUXIN:
Tell him. I shouldn't tell him.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.582
Tell him.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.818
Don't tell him.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.553
Tell him.

13:06.587 --> 13:09.155
Hey. Hey.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.291
Hey!

13:11.324 --> 13:13.159
What?! What the hell?
Who are you?

13:13.193 --> 13:14.828
Where am I?

13:14.861 --> 13:16.329
Come on.
What are you, an idiot?

13:16.362 --> 13:18.532
Who do I look like?

13:19.600 --> 13:21.935
Should I know who you are?
I would think so.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.570
Did you jerk off
into a sock when you were 12?

13:23.604 --> 13:25.171
Yes, but who didn't?
Okay, yeah.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.173
Camp Whiterow.
You scored ten points

13:27.207 --> 13:28.842
in the color war game,
you came home,

13:28.875 --> 13:30.911
you told everybody
you scored 28.
28.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.914
In the sixth grade, you played
Ali Hakim in Oklahoma!
In Oklahoma!

13:33.947 --> 13:35.849
Oh, yeah. They cut the song.
Yeah, they cut my song,
"It's a Scandal!"

13:35.882 --> 13:37.518
"It's a Scandal,
it's a... it's an Outrage!"
"It's an Outrage!"

13:37.551 --> 13:38.919
It was a scandal!
A scandal!

13:38.952 --> 13:40.921
BOTH:
It was an outrage!

13:40.954 --> 13:42.355
So you're me.

13:42.388 --> 13:43.524
Sorry to say I am.

13:43.557 --> 13:46.192
Yes, I'm Ruxin
from the future.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.361
The hair's a bummer, man.

13:48.394 --> 13:50.496
The hair's a real bummer.
You know why that happened?

13:50.531 --> 13:52.498
No.
After you told Andre,

13:52.533 --> 13:55.502
you lost your job, you lost your
friends, you lost the league.

13:55.536 --> 13:58.004
So you're saying that because
I told Andre, I lost my hair?

13:58.038 --> 13:59.339
Yeah, I got used to it
after a while.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.207
Really?
Yeah.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.876
Do women?
There's a small

14:02.909 --> 14:04.645
percentage that has
a thing for it.
Really?

14:04.678 --> 14:07.347
Yes. Those are the ones
you got to go after.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.381
How are they?

14:08.414 --> 14:10.216
Not great. Yeah.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.352
Hey, come on, I want
to show you something.
Just show it to me here.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.954
I can't show it to you here.
I'm comfortable in bed.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.421
Why do I have to get
up and go somewhere?
Get‐get up.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.958
Come on, let's go.
I want to show you something!

14:17.991 --> 14:20.627
All right, all right,
all right.

14:20.661 --> 14:22.495
(both sigh)

14:25.198 --> 14:27.367
So, what, I make
some decision

14:27.400 --> 14:30.571
to tell Andre, the league falls
apart, everything goes to shit?

14:30.604 --> 14:31.605
Even worse.

14:32.573 --> 14:34.107
Holy shit,
that's the Oracle.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.509
JENNY:
The Freaky Friedman kid?

14:35.542 --> 14:37.911
My God, I'm gonna
go talk to him.
Okay.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.179
I'll pay for the nuts.
Oracle!

14:39.212 --> 14:41.682
Still licking food
and putting it back. Classic.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.117
Excuse me?
You still play
fantasy football, man?

14:44.150 --> 14:45.686
I'm having problems with
my number‐two running back

14:45.719 --> 14:47.253
this week.
I got Melvin Gordon.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.655
ORACLE:
I wouldn't worry about it.

14:48.689 --> 14:51.391
See, what happens
this week is...

14:51.424 --> 14:53.126
you die.

14:53.159 --> 14:56.396
(snorts) Okay. Uh, you don't
have to get so dramatic, man.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.198
I haven't told you
the rest of my lineup.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.133
I got Melvin Gordon or...
(gasps)

15:00.166 --> 15:01.635
(choking)

15:05.338 --> 15:06.707
Kevin? Kevin?

15:06.740 --> 15:08.408
Kevin! Kevin!
Oh, my God, help me! Help!

15:08.441 --> 15:09.676
Oh, my God.

15:09.710 --> 15:11.945
I can't believe
Jenny's a widow.
Well,

15:11.978 --> 15:13.279
didn't exactly
say that.

15:13.313 --> 15:16.449
(filtered breathing)

15:18.484 --> 15:20.153
Honey, I'm home from work.

15:20.186 --> 15:21.955
How was your day?

15:21.988 --> 15:23.957
Those kids wanted a spaceman
at their birthday party,

15:23.990 --> 15:25.592
and they got one.
I bet they did.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.328
Ellie, dinner!

15:28.361 --> 15:30.030
Oh, my God.
ELLIE: I heard you, Mom.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.098
Ugh, yuck.
I'll eat at the tattoo parlor.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.466
Such a hard worker.

15:33.499 --> 15:34.434
Sweetheart, what are
you gonna eat there‐‐

15:34.467 --> 15:35.435
Red Bull and vodka?

15:35.468 --> 15:37.237
Maybe, biatch.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.039
Are you gonna be bringing home
the older gentleman

15:39.072 --> 15:40.607
you're in a casual
relationship with?

15:40.641 --> 15:43.744
And don't forget to pick up
your kid at day care.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.646
There he is.

15:45.679 --> 15:48.649
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
not so fast, young man.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.050
(gasps)
Oh.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.652
Chalupa Batman, is that a joint?

15:51.685 --> 15:52.719
What did I tell you?

15:52.753 --> 15:55.055
Do not steal
from your father's stash!

15:55.088 --> 15:56.089
Mm‐mm.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.357
Use your vape instead.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.059
Attaboy.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.194
Look at this family
we've got, huh?

16:01.227 --> 16:02.495
(both grunting)

16:02.529 --> 16:04.598
Let's do it
in front of the kid.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.199
Okay.
Okay, fine.

16:06.232 --> 16:08.334
I want to see what happens
if I don't tell Andre.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.335
Do I win The Shiva?

16:09.369 --> 16:11.271
Maybe.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.774
Mm.
Mm.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.209
You know,
it is so flattering,

16:16.242 --> 16:19.646
but you do not have to blast
my name every time you climax.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.381
I actually legally do.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.650
(laughs):
No, you don't.

16:23.684 --> 16:25.351
Well, I'm happy you're happy,
because now

16:25.385 --> 16:27.220
you're stuck with me, Rodney.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.355
Everybody calls me
Somakanakram.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.757
I can't believe
you took my name.

16:30.791 --> 16:33.794
And legally changed my
first name to Ruxin.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.762
(giggles)

16:35.796 --> 16:37.798
Okay, well, good to know
what happens, theoretically,

16:37.831 --> 16:39.633
in the future,
but what happens this year?

16:39.666 --> 16:40.667
Do I win the league?

16:40.701 --> 16:43.136
That's up to you.

16:43.169 --> 16:46.239
So... Okay, I'll‐I'll make
a decision here.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.108
Just... I mean,
what do you think?

16:48.141 --> 16:49.776
Do I play LeSean McCoy? Does he
end up having a good week?

16:49.810 --> 16:51.144
Come on, do the right thing.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.513
I would do the right thing
if I knew

16:52.546 --> 16:53.780
I had a rock‐solid lineup.

16:53.814 --> 16:55.816
Stop tinkering and choose.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.719
Okay, fine. But you know where
I like to do my final tinkers.

16:58.752 --> 17:01.054
Yes, I know where you like
to do your final tinkers.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.388
Mm.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.657
Mm.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.258
Mm.
Mm.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.159
Mm.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.562
Mm...
Mm...

17:08.595 --> 17:11.131
All right, I don't think
I need to be here for this.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.266
I will, uh, let myself out.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.135
Wow. I mean,

17:15.168 --> 17:17.538
what a pleasure!
What a pleasure!

17:17.571 --> 17:19.806
We have to get together!
We have to get together!

17:19.840 --> 17:21.708
Aw... Oh, yeah.
Aw... Oh, yeah.

17:21.742 --> 17:24.578
Uh, yeah, okay. Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh, uh...

17:24.611 --> 17:26.813
Yeah, sure.

17:26.847 --> 17:28.782
Mm...

17:30.383 --> 17:32.553
Mm.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.089
Is there a problem?
Nope.

17:36.122 --> 17:37.157
No problem.

17:37.190 --> 17:40.126
I just kind of forgot, uh...

17:46.900 --> 17:48.769
(scoffs)
I hate myself.

17:48.802 --> 17:51.204
(computer beeps, Ruxin groans)

17:51.237 --> 17:53.774
Oh, no, no!

17:53.807 --> 17:57.110
Getting older sucks.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.780
Whoa.

17:59.813 --> 18:01.181
Pete Eckhart.
Hey.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.783
Hi, I'm James.
I'm with DraftKings.

18:02.816 --> 18:03.784
Welcome to fantasy football
world championships.

18:03.817 --> 18:05.318
Thanks.

18:05.351 --> 18:06.753
Little FYI‐‐
tournament's no different

18:06.787 --> 18:08.321
than what you've been
doing all season.

18:08.354 --> 18:10.256
Here's the thing,
there's only ten players.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.658
Highest score wins it all.

18:11.692 --> 18:12.793
Oh, that's crazy‐‐
my league is actually

18:12.826 --> 18:14.260
doing the same thing this week.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.461
Your other league
allows you to win

18:15.495 --> 18:16.863
a million dollars at the end?

18:16.897 --> 18:18.632
No, we‐we compete for a trophy.
It's... it's actually

18:18.665 --> 18:20.601
named after this girl
we went to high school with.

18:20.634 --> 18:22.903
Her name...
Great story. Nicky, get him
a ticket to paradise,

18:22.936 --> 18:23.904
show him to his table.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.806
Good luck, Peter.
Uh, okay, yeah.

18:25.839 --> 18:26.773
See you out there, man.

18:26.807 --> 18:29.475
This...

18:30.644 --> 18:31.812
Oh, you know, I'm
in my high school

18:31.845 --> 18:33.614
league championships
at the same time,

18:33.647 --> 18:34.915
so I'm pulling double duty.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.349
Yeah, you should
definitely work on that.

18:36.382 --> 18:38.251
I'll, uh, focus
on winning a million dollars.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.620
Dick.

18:39.653 --> 18:41.622
He's actually right.
The hell am I doing?

18:41.655 --> 18:43.757
All right, set that lineup.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.892
Adrian Peterson. My Eskimo
brother. I mean, it's A. D.

18:45.926 --> 18:48.261
You got to do it, right?
Are you trying
to look at my lineup?

18:48.294 --> 18:49.796
No, I was just
talking about football.

18:49.830 --> 18:52.298
Why would I want to talk
about football with you?

18:52.332 --> 18:54.300
I'm actively trying to beat you.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.435
I also want you to lose.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.237
This is really fun.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.506
I cannot believe
that we are ending the season

18:59.540 --> 19:00.807
like we began it‐‐

19:00.841 --> 19:02.909
in shitty costumes.

19:02.943 --> 19:05.646
Relax and behold
the Maha Shivaratri.

19:05.679 --> 19:07.648
The great night
of Shiva.

19:07.681 --> 19:08.815
Wait, is this, like,
a real religious ceremony?

19:08.849 --> 19:10.316
Yeah.

19:10.350 --> 19:13.286
Om Namah Shivaya.
Praise Shiva.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.821
Praise Shiva.
Praise Shiva.

19:14.855 --> 19:16.322
RUXIN: Praise Shiva.
ANDRE: Praise Shiva.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.390
We do not belong here.

19:17.423 --> 19:18.825
We absolutely belong here.

19:18.859 --> 19:20.827
KEVIN: Yeah, we've got
The Shiva, The Sacko...

19:20.861 --> 19:22.563
JENNY: And don't
forget the Snip.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.531
Ah.
I got to hand it
to you, Commish.

19:24.565 --> 19:25.866
How'd you swing this place?

19:25.899 --> 19:27.834
Oh, I told 'em
that the trophies were...

19:27.868 --> 19:29.570
a special offering.

19:29.603 --> 19:30.671
And I did bring a way

19:30.704 --> 19:32.673
for us to watch the late games

19:32.706 --> 19:34.307
on the iPad.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.976
Ooh, all praise Wi‐Fi.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.410
While we're on the subject
of praising,

19:37.443 --> 19:39.479
let's do this right, shall we?

19:39.513 --> 19:41.314
For you.
What are you doing?

19:41.347 --> 19:43.483
There are no false idols.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.586
(speaking foreign language)

19:45.619 --> 19:46.987
KEVIN:
Oh, oh, guys, guys.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.354
Quiet. It's starting.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.990
(speaks foreign language)

19:50.023 --> 19:52.392
(Indian pop music playing)

19:58.599 --> 20:00.901
That's cool.
How are the Bears doing?

20:00.934 --> 20:02.803
(man singing
in foreign language)

20:05.606 --> 20:07.874
(whoops)
Yeah!

20:09.610 --> 20:11.978
Put your hands up!
Put your hands up! Ooh!

20:13.379 --> 20:15.381
Ooh! Ooh!

20:15.415 --> 20:16.316
Taco!

20:16.349 --> 20:17.784
What's going on, guys?

20:17.818 --> 20:20.887
I have reappeared! Smoke.

20:20.921 --> 20:21.988
I couldn't stay away,

20:22.022 --> 20:23.590
even if means going to jail.

20:23.624 --> 20:24.725
How's it going?

20:24.758 --> 20:26.026
You come to this temple often?

20:26.059 --> 20:26.893
Taco, get over here!

20:26.927 --> 20:28.829
I'll talk to you later.

20:29.830 --> 20:31.264
Hey, guys.

20:31.297 --> 20:32.365
What are you doing?

20:32.398 --> 20:33.734
Wow, look at all these people

20:33.767 --> 20:35.902
worshiping The Shiva.

20:35.936 --> 20:37.771
Fantasy football's really taken
off over the past few years.

20:44.778 --> 20:46.046
Yes! Matt Forte, TD!
That was a value pick, too.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.814
Suck it, shit‐sippers!

20:47.848 --> 20:50.617
Excuse me. That's
inappropriate language.

20:50.651 --> 20:51.952
Well, it's smack talk.
This is fantasy.

20:51.985 --> 20:54.688
Come on.
Why would you think
that I sip shit?

20:54.721 --> 20:56.422
Oh, you know what?
Forget it. You...

20:56.456 --> 20:57.658
(cheering over TV)
Aaron Rodgers!

20:57.691 --> 20:58.959
TD! Come on!

20:58.992 --> 21:00.026
MAN:
Stop.

21:00.060 --> 21:01.795
Don't look at me.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.296
I want to foot‐punch
your face.

21:03.329 --> 21:04.931
I don't care. I'm winning.

21:04.965 --> 21:07.901
(speaking foreign language)

21:07.934 --> 21:09.803
Ooh, Rudolfo,
give me a spritz of that.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.839
You know what? Give me a little
kiss on this cheek, too.

21:12.873 --> 21:14.374
(silly giggling)

21:14.407 --> 21:16.677
Looks like The Sacko
is concluding first.
Oh.

21:16.710 --> 21:20.514
And tied with the lowest score,
we have Pete and Taco.

21:20.547 --> 21:21.948
Who's The Sacko?
Pete's got no one left,

21:21.982 --> 21:23.850
and you have
Justin Tucker.

21:23.884 --> 21:25.919
Baltimore is about
to kick you guys.
Yup.

21:25.952 --> 21:26.953
Justin Tucker's
a kicker?

21:26.987 --> 21:27.854
Yup.
Yes!

21:27.888 --> 21:29.523
I had Justin Tucker once.

21:29.556 --> 21:30.924
You've had every kicker once.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.694
Guys, I won! Pete Eckhart!
I won a million dollars!

21:33.727 --> 21:35.696
Yeah, you're also about
to get The Sacko, so...
MAN (over TV): Justin Tucker

21:35.729 --> 21:37.664
gets ready for the kick
from 47 yards out.
Oh, shit.

21:37.698 --> 21:38.865
Oh, kick is up.
MAN (over TV): The kick is up.

21:38.899 --> 21:40.667
And... ooh, no good.

21:40.701 --> 21:42.402
Yes!
Mm. No. Flag.

21:42.435 --> 21:43.870
MAN (on TV): Wait. We've got
a flag on the play.
Oh.

21:43.904 --> 21:45.706
Offside, Pittsburgh.
Five‐yard penalty.

21:45.739 --> 21:46.807
KEVIN:
Offsides on Pittsburgh!

21:46.840 --> 21:47.874
Aah!
Offside?

21:47.908 --> 21:49.710
That is a shitty call!

21:49.743 --> 21:50.977
I don't know.
The ref said.

21:51.011 --> 21:52.879
Yeah. Refs.
Okay. All right.

21:52.913 --> 21:54.080
Uh. Rekick.
MAN (over TV):
Here's the rekick. It's up.

21:54.114 --> 21:55.982
And it's good.
And it's...

21:56.016 --> 21:57.483
Another three points.
...good.

21:57.518 --> 21:59.986
Oh, son of a... Sacko!

22:00.020 --> 22:01.888
No, no, no, I saw him miss it.

22:01.922 --> 22:02.856
I lost fair and square.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.758
He didn't have
to redo it for me.

22:04.791 --> 22:07.561
Pete, you lost because of
a bad call from the ref.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.029
Karma's a real bitch.

22:09.062 --> 22:11.765
Should I remind you guys that
I just won a million dollars?

22:11.798 --> 22:13.867
Should I remind you
you are... Sacko!

22:13.900 --> 22:14.835
Sacko!

22:14.868 --> 22:15.902
Sacko!
Sacko!

22:15.936 --> 22:16.703
Oh, Sacko!

22:16.737 --> 22:17.571
♪ Sack‐oh! ♪

22:17.604 --> 22:18.438
Sacko!

22:18.471 --> 22:20.440
Sacko del Toro!

22:20.473 --> 22:23.043
You know, I am rich enough that
this really shouldn't bother me,

22:23.076 --> 22:24.110
but this really bothers me!

22:24.144 --> 22:26.379
Money can't buy you
not‐Sacko‐ness.

22:26.412 --> 22:28.849
What about The Shiva?
We'll find out soon enough.

22:28.882 --> 22:30.016
Ladies and gentlemen,
please come

22:30.050 --> 22:31.885
and seek the blessings
of Lord Shiva.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.019
Oh, now's the time.
Here we go, guys.
PETE: Oh.

22:33.053 --> 22:34.721
This?
Yup, this way. Come on.

22:34.755 --> 22:36.890
Here we go. This.

22:36.923 --> 22:39.993
ALL (chanting):
Om Namah Shivaya.
Om Namah Shivaya.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.896
Om Namah Shivaya.

22:42.929 --> 22:47.000
Om Namah Shivaya.
Om Namah Shivaya.

22:47.033 --> 22:51.638
(shouting):
Shiva Komedi Somakanakram!

22:51.672 --> 22:53.073
(whoops)
Excuse me.
What...?

22:53.106 --> 22:54.741
Just, with you in one second.

22:54.775 --> 22:57.477
Now, first up, the
Fertility Bowl.
(Jenny laughs)

22:57.511 --> 23:00.647
With a score of 87 to 76,
I am happy to announce

23:00.681 --> 23:02.883
I am keeping my parts
the way they are!

23:02.916 --> 23:03.917
What? No! No!
Yes!

23:03.950 --> 23:05.485
No, give me that!
Let me see that!

23:05.519 --> 23:07.020
Sorry about
your balls, Jenny.
What?

23:07.053 --> 23:08.054
Shut up, Pete!
But if you're gonna

23:08.088 --> 23:09.556
open up the hood, you should

23:09.590 --> 23:10.757
let me in there,
and I could just get...

23:10.791 --> 23:12.626
What? No! Shut up
about my parts!

23:12.659 --> 23:14.761
Jenny, here's the Snip.
You are the winner.
No.

23:14.795 --> 23:16.563
No, I'm not taking that!
This whole thing is stupid!

23:16.597 --> 23:18.765
I'm not doing it!
Jenny! Oh, Jenny, come on!

23:18.799 --> 23:20.634
Don't... What? What?
No, no, no, no, no.
Shiva.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.035
Shiva, Shiva, Shiva.
All right, fine.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.436
I wasn't gonna make her do it.

23:23.469 --> 23:24.938
I just wanted
to lord my victory over her.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.973
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Everyone waiting here!

23:27.007 --> 23:28.942
Chill out.
Your league'll be next.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.977
Now to the main event‐‐
the Shiva Bowl.

23:31.011 --> 23:32.646
PETE:
Finally.

23:32.679 --> 23:33.980
And the winner is...

23:34.014 --> 23:35.949
a tie

23:35.982 --> 23:37.117
between Ruxin

23:37.150 --> 23:38.952
and the Coin‐‐ 84 to 84.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.120
Well, so that means I won.

23:40.153 --> 23:41.855
No, we have to go
to the tie‐breakers.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.056
The tie‐breakers are
all even, as well.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.791
Points, record,
head‐to‐head.

23:44.825 --> 23:46.226
Well, I won.
I mean, what are you gonna do?

23:46.259 --> 23:47.661
How are we gonna solve this?

23:47.694 --> 23:48.829
I say flip the Coin.
Yes.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.096
Flip the Coin?

23:50.130 --> 23:52.132
The Coin is obviously
gonna choose himself.

23:52.165 --> 23:53.867
Come on.
What do you mean,
"choose himself"?

23:53.900 --> 23:55.001
It's Coin collusion!
PETE:
Okay, here it is.

23:55.035 --> 23:56.537
It is not Coin collusion.

23:56.570 --> 23:57.838
I mean, this is a classic
case of Coin collusion!

23:57.871 --> 23:59.105
Well, how do we break
the tie, then?

23:59.139 --> 24:00.140
You can't have a race,
you can't...

24:00.173 --> 24:02.075
Just... flip it!

24:02.108 --> 24:04.244
You heard the man.
All right, we'll
flip the Coin.

24:04.277 --> 24:06.146
You can call it
in the air, okay?

24:06.179 --> 24:07.848
Oh, thanks so much.

24:07.881 --> 24:09.049
Okay. Here we go.

24:09.850 --> 24:12.686
♪ ♪

24:12.719 --> 24:13.787
Heads. No, tails.

24:15.589 --> 24:16.723
(heart beating)

24:19.593 --> 24:20.994
Oh!

24:21.027 --> 24:22.996
Mother...

24:23.029 --> 24:25.699
(bleep)

24:25.732 --> 24:26.867
(bleep), future Ruxin!

24:26.900 --> 24:28.168
He (bleep) me!

24:28.201 --> 24:29.703
If I ever see him again,

24:29.736 --> 24:31.037
I'm gonna chop off
both of his butt cheeks,

24:31.071 --> 24:33.239
use 'em as buns,
then chop off

24:33.273 --> 24:35.742
his meaty clackers,
stick 'em together

24:35.776 --> 24:39.045
in a big meatball sub,
and then make him eat it!

24:39.079 --> 24:40.514
Okay, I'm gonna go see how

24:40.547 --> 24:41.748
Jenny's doing, so...

24:41.782 --> 24:43.584
You had to tinker
on the Coin flip.

24:43.617 --> 24:45.719
PETE:
Is this what it comes down to?

24:45.752 --> 24:47.521
I mean, a coin
is our Shiva Bowl champion?

24:47.554 --> 24:49.723
Shiva, is this what you want?

24:49.756 --> 24:51.892
Are we all so unworthy?
Yes.

24:51.925 --> 24:53.293
Now, get the hell off my stage!

24:53.326 --> 24:54.728
Well, I'll just keep this
for safekeeping.
Ooh! Change.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.162
Here we go.

24:56.196 --> 24:57.598
Just total bullshit!
RUXIN: Get your trophy.

24:57.631 --> 24:59.733
Oh. Oh, get my trophy, Ruxin?

24:59.766 --> 25:01.167
I will get my trophy.

25:01.201 --> 25:04.605
I will get my trophy, and then
I will throw it directly into

25:04.638 --> 25:06.072
the trash!
Guys, I couldn't
find Jenny... Hey!

25:06.106 --> 25:07.040
(Kevin and Jenny screaming)

25:07.073 --> 25:08.141
ALL:
Oh!
JENNY:
Oh, my God!

25:08.174 --> 25:09.209
(Kevin screaming)

25:09.242 --> 25:10.911
Oh, my God!

25:10.944 --> 25:12.679
(high‐pitched screaming)

25:12.713 --> 25:14.147
JENNY: Oh, no!
KEVIN: Oh!

25:14.180 --> 25:16.216
Oh, no!
Oh, God, is it bad?

25:16.249 --> 25:17.951
No.
No.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.319
Yeah, it's awful.

25:19.352 --> 25:20.887
RUXIN:
Ugh, what a tragedy.

25:20.921 --> 25:23.223
I can't believe
I lost to the Coin.

25:23.256 --> 25:24.891
What the (bleep)
is going on?

25:24.925 --> 25:26.793
Just normal
fantasy football stuff.
(Kevin screaming)

25:34.000 --> 25:35.636
(beeping)
KEVIN: What's going on?
What happened?

25:35.669 --> 25:36.970
Just relax, Kevin.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.805
You've lost a lot of blood,
but you're gonna be fine.

25:38.839 --> 25:40.106
Smells like bacon.

25:40.140 --> 25:42.242
That... is not bacon.

25:42.275 --> 25:43.910
We're cauterizing
the smaller vessels.

25:43.944 --> 25:45.078
(Kevin gasping softly)

25:48.114 --> 25:50.050
(sighs)

25:50.083 --> 25:53.053
Hey, handsome,
you're awake.

25:53.086 --> 25:54.788
What happened?
SHIVA:
Kevin,

25:54.821 --> 25:57.658
you've suffered extensive trauma
from a sharp object.

25:57.691 --> 25:58.692
Oh. What?

25:58.725 --> 25:59.993
We couldn't save your testicles.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.261
Oh.
Oh, God.

26:01.294 --> 26:03.196
Kevin, you got straight‐up
snipped by the Snip.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.798
So I'm gonna lose my balls?

26:04.831 --> 26:05.666
They are gone.

26:05.699 --> 26:07.000
Did you keep them?

26:07.033 --> 26:08.669
Well, I can ask.

26:08.702 --> 26:10.003
Please.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.938
I want them
to go in The Sacko.

26:13.006 --> 26:14.941
PETE:
I will go look

26:14.975 --> 26:16.142
in the Dumpster right now
if that's where they are...

26:16.176 --> 26:17.878
RUXIN:
Hold on,

26:17.911 --> 26:20.146
so Pete wins The Sacko,
which means he gets Andre's

26:20.180 --> 26:22.716
beach house, and he now has
the money to fix it up,

26:22.749 --> 26:24.885
and he gets Kevin's balls?

26:24.918 --> 26:26.820
How is this a Sacko punishment?

26:26.853 --> 26:30.023
Well, as
The Sacko commissioner, um...

26:30.056 --> 26:32.826
It is decided?

26:32.859 --> 26:37.030
I'm sorry. Kevin just lost
both of his testicles,

26:37.063 --> 26:38.231
and all you care about
is your league?

26:38.264 --> 26:40.100
(quietly):
Hmm. Yeah.

26:40.133 --> 26:41.968
Yes. It was what
I was thinking about, too.

26:42.002 --> 26:43.136
Well, at least
you guys are consistent.

26:43.169 --> 26:44.871
Ever since I've
known you, you have

26:44.905 --> 26:46.973
never stopped being stupid.

26:47.007 --> 26:48.709
Kevin, I've given this
a lot of thought,

26:48.742 --> 26:52.112
and I'm willing to donate
one of my testicles to you.

26:52.145 --> 26:54.715
No, I don't want it.
It'll be the
one I use less.

26:54.748 --> 26:56.850
Like the lazy‐eye testicle,
the one that wanders.

26:56.883 --> 26:58.752
Here, feel this guy right here.
No. God almighty, Taco.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.153
That guy.
Oh, my God.

27:00.186 --> 27:01.287
JENNY:
Oh, God.
It's gonna be yours.

27:01.321 --> 27:02.856
It's gonna be in you.

27:02.889 --> 27:04.057
ANDRE: I just
want you to know

27:04.090 --> 27:05.025
that I'll do
the procedure.

27:05.058 --> 27:06.660
Let me see the canvas

27:06.693 --> 27:08.328
I'm working with here.
(gasps)
TACO: Oh!

27:08.361 --> 27:10.396
Oh, looks like someone sucked
the pork out of a dumpling.

27:10.430 --> 27:12.132
Well, guess that's
the end of the season.

27:12.165 --> 27:13.667
All the winners and losers
are accounted for.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.135
Except for one, Pete.

27:15.168 --> 27:17.137
May I remind you of a bet
that you and I had

27:17.170 --> 27:19.039
about who would be happier
at the end of the season.

27:19.072 --> 27:20.674
Right. Yes.
And I know that

27:20.707 --> 27:22.208
you won the house
and all that money.

27:22.242 --> 27:25.211
But I...
am gonna be the father

27:25.245 --> 27:27.948
of a beautiful baby boy.

27:27.981 --> 27:29.883
I won, and it's
not even close.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.417
Well, Andre, I cannot
compete with that.

27:31.451 --> 27:33.153
As a consolation prize,

27:33.186 --> 27:35.188
I'll quit my job,
I'll never work again,

27:35.221 --> 27:37.423
and I will buy
a first‐class plane ticket

27:37.457 --> 27:39.225
and fly off
into the California sunset.

27:39.259 --> 27:40.761
Woe is me.

27:40.794 --> 27:43.063
Arrivederci.

27:43.096 --> 27:45.165
You know what Pete used
to say about fantasy football?

27:45.198 --> 27:47.333
"There are many things
a man can do with his time,

27:47.367 --> 27:49.335
"but this...

27:49.369 --> 27:51.104
is better than those things."

27:51.137 --> 27:52.773
(gasps)

27:52.806 --> 27:55.375
Did you feel that?
Oh, my God, it kicked!

27:55.408 --> 27:56.943
We need to Vine this.
Let's go. Come on.

27:56.977 --> 27:58.178
Okay.
Oh, my God.

27:58.211 --> 27:59.445
MEEGAN: It's so
exciting when he kicks!

27:59.479 --> 28:01.214
They seem happy.

28:01.247 --> 28:03.049
We're not gonna
tell Andre, right?

28:03.083 --> 28:05.018
Wait. You knew?

28:06.252 --> 28:09.255
This unmentionable
stays unmentioned.

28:09.289 --> 28:11.091
At least until the kid's
18th birthday.

28:11.124 --> 28:13.193
Mm.
You want to get
a coffee, talk about it?

28:13.226 --> 28:16.029
Let's go.

28:19.132 --> 28:22.135
Happy 18th birthday, son.
Thank you.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.470
I have spared no expense
making you into a great man.

28:24.505 --> 28:27.140
Enrolling you
in the best magic camps

28:27.173 --> 28:29.142
and teaching you
the fine art of haberdashery.

28:29.175 --> 28:32.145
But this is the one
I'm most excited about.

28:32.178 --> 28:33.479
Your own fantasy team.

28:33.514 --> 28:35.215
Really, Father?

28:35.248 --> 28:36.750
Welcome to the league!

28:36.783 --> 28:38.118
(laughs)

28:38.151 --> 28:40.486
Welcome to the league!

28:41.522 --> 28:43.123
Okay.

28:43.156 --> 28:45.225
Huh? Your first
message board message!

28:45.258 --> 28:48.862
Hello, Andre.
You are watching this video

28:48.895 --> 28:50.030
18 years in the future.

28:50.063 --> 28:51.765
Andre, what's the future like?

28:51.798 --> 28:53.767
What are the douchiest
douche bags wearing now?

28:53.800 --> 28:55.836
I don't know.
We are shooting this video

28:55.869 --> 28:59.305
on the day your son,
Andre II, was born.

28:59.339 --> 29:00.373
The Deuce!

29:00.406 --> 29:02.175
Named after your turd
of a father.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.176
He's not... not a turd.

29:03.209 --> 29:04.978
It's actually
a more fashionable way

29:05.011 --> 29:06.513
to say "Junior."
KEVIN: Speaking of which,

29:06.547 --> 29:08.414
we have something
we'd like to tell you.

29:08.448 --> 29:11.184

Suck it!

Yes!

Yeah!
