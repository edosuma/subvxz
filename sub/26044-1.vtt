01:01.962 --> 01:07.666
My first child died inside me,
inside my swollen womb.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.668
The doctor said
it was her heart,

01:09.670 --> 01:12.337
it wasn't growing
like it should've.

01:12.339 --> 01:15.040
My mom said to me then
that death is not cruel,

01:15.042 --> 01:20.212
death is a gift from god,
just as life is.

01:20.214 --> 01:24.783
I told mom
i wasn't so sure about god.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.920
And then there was ed,

01:27.922 --> 01:30.989
the still babe held tight
to his chest,

01:30.991 --> 01:35.327
he looked thin and pale
as the underside of a leaf.

01:35.329 --> 01:38.197
And I knew then that
it must have been my heart

01:38.199 --> 01:40.199
that could not fill
her heart properly,

01:40.201 --> 01:43.869
'cause I can see her tiny fist
between the folds of the cloth

01:43.871 --> 01:47.773
and I know she was anything
but weak.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.238
Okay, let's give the legs
a little break

02:19.240 --> 02:21.824
and work on our upper body.

02:21.825 --> 02:24.409
Stretch your hands up as wide
as you can up to the sky,

02:24.411 --> 02:27.346
prayer hands
and snowflakes coming down,

02:27.348 --> 02:29.882
snowflakes coming down,
snowflakes coming down.

02:29.884 --> 02:32.451
And one more time
reach up as high as you can.

02:32.453 --> 02:36.588
Reach, reach, reach
and snowflakes coming down.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.257
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

02:38.258 --> 02:39.925
One more time, one more time,
feels so good.

02:39.927 --> 02:44.496
Reach up prayer hands
and then snowflakes coming down.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.298
Oh, good, good, good.

02:46.300 --> 02:50.002
Okay, imagine you have
a giant ball in your hand.

02:50.004 --> 02:52.538
Reach to the side
and to the other side

02:52.540 --> 02:57.109
and get your ribcage involved
and scoop way up with one hand

02:57.111 --> 02:58.677
and reach beautiful.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.747
Just majestically,
you're a ballerina dancer.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.448
Yes, reaching, reaching,
reaching.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.017
Really good.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.465
- You want some tea, dear?
-Say what?

03:20.467 --> 03:21.667
You want some tea, dear?

03:21.669 --> 03:24.136
Yeah, I'd love some, thank you.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.106
Oh, here.

03:31.178 --> 03:32.077
Got it.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.213
- Here.
- Yes.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.883
Oh.

03:37.885 --> 03:41.286
Guess I got
a little drinking problem.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.088
I spoke to don today.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.090
Yeah, and?

03:45.092 --> 03:47.059
Yeah, they need young guys.

03:47.061 --> 03:49.361
I was afraid they might.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.418
It'll be good for him.

03:56.419 --> 03:58.402
He's gotta grow up sometime,
look after himself.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.341
Least he'll have money
in his jeans.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.112
I kinda like
brushed one with my hand,

04:07.114 --> 04:08.814
like this,
but I didn't like

04:08.816 --> 04:10.082
stick my finger up in it
or anything.

04:10.084 --> 04:14.786
Yeah, it's like a cave
or somethin' up there.

04:14.788 --> 04:19.124
Like a fish mouth.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.226
But it was good, right?

04:21.228 --> 04:22.127
It felt good?

04:22.129 --> 04:22.894
Yeah.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.663
Get you kinda hard and shit?

04:24.665 --> 04:26.632
I guess, ya.

04:28.102 --> 04:31.303
Makes me hard
just thinkin' about it.

04:35.209 --> 04:37.376
Yeah, I don't know.

04:40.414 --> 04:44.182
Like i-- I like to fuck
and shit, you know?

04:46.854 --> 04:48.553

04:48.555 --> 04:50.255
Who did you fuck?

04:50.257 --> 04:51.990

04:51.992 --> 04:52.991
Yeah, right?

04:52.993 --> 04:54.126

04:57.798 --> 05:04.169
Okay, I like to fuck for sure,

05:04.171 --> 05:05.570
For sure, for sure.

05:05.572 --> 05:10.208
It's just all that other stuff.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.938

05:46.113 --> 05:48.814

06:21.181 --> 06:25.450

06:25.452 --> 06:28.487
Maybe, what do you mean maybe?

06:28.489 --> 06:32.557
I mean I'm busy
is what I mean.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.729
Well, you don't look busy.

06:38.265 --> 06:43.168
Look clearly
I've got shit to do, okay?

06:43.170 --> 06:45.704
Well, here's the thing,

06:45.705 --> 06:48.239
I told don that
you're coming in today.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.742
Why?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.243
You could see if they need help
at the auto shop you know,

06:51.245 --> 06:52.677
if you like instead.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.446
Yeah, you know,
just talk to Glen.

06:54.448 --> 06:58.550
I don't wanna talk to Glen, mom.

07:00.921 --> 07:04.723
It's not a life sentence, Jamie.

07:04.725 --> 07:07.259
It's a job.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.797
Wash your bowl please.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.619
Jamie?

07:34.621 --> 07:36.822
Come on in, son.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.132
18, you say?

07:51.004 --> 07:55.207
You ready to find some hair
on that chest, are ya?

07:55.209 --> 07:57.476
Worked on a drilling rig before?

07:57.478 --> 07:59.628
No.

07:59.629 --> 08:01.779
A camp, logging camp, something?

08:01.782 --> 08:03.582
I worked at the mill
for a while.

08:03.584 --> 08:07.319
Oh yeah, what happened there?

08:09.523 --> 08:11.456
What do you mean?

08:11.457 --> 08:13.390
Well, you don't work there
anymore.

08:13.393 --> 08:16.027
No one does.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.363
But you only worked there
for a month.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.832
Yeah.

08:20.834 --> 08:26.271
I kinda uh,
i kinda messed up the forklift.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.110
You scared of heights?

08:32.111 --> 08:33.044
Don't think so.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.297
Don't think so?

08:35.298 --> 08:37.549
I guess I've not done
a lot of climbing.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.650
Not as a kid,
climbing trees and that?

08:39.653 --> 08:40.585
Yeah, I guess I did that.

08:40.587 --> 08:43.154
So were you scared then?

08:43.155 --> 08:44.789
No.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.858
Alright then.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.962
Where do you see yourself
in five years?

08:50.964 --> 08:53.064
On the lease?

08:53.066 --> 08:55.066
Doin' what kid?

08:55.068 --> 09:00.238
Think about where
you're gonna excel.

09:00.240 --> 09:04.776
Maybe it could be a tool push.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.044
Is that right?

09:09.283 --> 09:12.617
We got your piss already,
didn't we?

09:12.619 --> 09:15.487
Squeaky clean, are ya?

09:15.489 --> 09:17.322
Criminal record?

09:17.324 --> 09:18.990
No.

09:54.161 --> 09:57.195
So you movin' out there?

09:57.197 --> 10:00.098
Guess so, yeah.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.367
When are you going?

10:02.369 --> 10:05.604
Couple weeks, I don't know.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.109
Give me a smoke.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.618
I don't know.

10:19.620 --> 10:20.585
What?

10:22.656 --> 10:25.624
It's you I'm worried about.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.258
Why's that?

10:27.260 --> 10:30.228
You're gonna turn into some
fucking hipster-shit asshole

10:30.230 --> 10:32.297
or something.

10:36.336 --> 10:42.307
What am I supposed to do,
stay here?

10:43.276 --> 10:45.610
You could blow me.

10:53.654 --> 10:57.956
Even your jokes
don't make fuckin' sense.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.291
Fuck that.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.252
Mom?

12:01.254 --> 12:02.854
What are you doing?

12:02.856 --> 12:05.490
I'm cleaning the oven dear.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.358
Oh, okay.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.893
You're up early.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.967
I think you've all
experienced this by now,

12:15.969 --> 12:17.402
maybe you're having trouble
speaking,

12:17.404 --> 12:20.839
people tell you to speak up,
ask you to repeat yourself.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.240
As your voice is getting softer,

12:22.242 --> 12:24.175
the words just don't
come as easy now.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.810
- Right?
- Yeah.

12:25.812 --> 12:27.746
Yeah, I'm seeing some nods here.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.782
Okay, so today
we're gonna imagine

12:30.784 --> 12:31.983
all those people leaning in

12:31.985 --> 12:34.953
and saying "speak up,
speak up, speak up!"

12:34.955 --> 12:38.523
We're gonna imagine
punching them in the face

12:38.525 --> 12:39.891
with our voice, okay?

12:39.893 --> 12:43.862
So sit up nice and straight
and as loud as we can,

12:43.864 --> 12:44.696
all together now,

12:44.698 --> 12:47.031
1, 2, 3...

12:47.033 --> 12:50.902
Ahhhhhhhhh!

13:06.018 --> 13:07.818
Good, I think I was Nadine
was the loudest that time.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.822
Good, now push the air out
with your tummy,

13:10.824 --> 13:11.756
ha-ha-ha.

13:11.758 --> 13:12.891
Right in there, okay?

13:12.893 --> 13:14.025
Ha-ha-ha.

13:14.027 --> 13:14.993
Knock 'em out.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.661
Okay, we're gonna go again.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.763
1, 2, 3...

14:21.194 --> 14:24.395
15-2, 15-4,
there ain't no more.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.196
Yeah.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.015
Four.

14:27.016 --> 14:28.833
3, 6, 8, 10,
and a pair is 12.

14:28.835 --> 14:31.669
Oh boy,
this stuff is strong, len.

14:31.671 --> 14:32.537
Care for a refill?

14:32.539 --> 14:33.371
She's had enough.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.373
I haven't even finished yet.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.843
Okay, I got nothin'.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.111
Your deal, ma'am.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.747
Oh yeah, okay.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.483
- Want me to do it?
- Yeah.

14:46.186 --> 14:51.289
So, Eileen,
she's been around lately?

14:51.291 --> 14:52.374
Nah.

14:52.375 --> 14:53.458
Then good thing
you didn't marry that one

14:53.460 --> 14:55.126
is all I'd say.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.261
Boy.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.830
Well, I married her alright.

14:58.832 --> 15:00.098
Oh Christ.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.200
Oh Lenny, you did not!

15:02.202 --> 15:03.585
He did.

15:03.586 --> 15:04.969
Uh, she always wanted
to get it done in the summer

15:04.971 --> 15:07.639
and I said, "heck, let's just
head on down in kamloops

15:07.641 --> 15:09.658
and get it done.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.676
She gonna divorce you,
that's gonna be the question.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.278
You got that, right?

15:13.280 --> 15:17.048
3, 6, oh.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.716
Quit lookin' at my cards.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.886
Quit floppin' em

15:24.591 --> 15:27.458
Okay.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.160
Okay, let's see, let's see.

Shoot, 23.

15:33.733 --> 15:34.432

15:42.309 --> 15:45.476

15:45.478 --> 15:46.711
Darnit, darnit.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.481
Ugh!

15:50.483 --> 15:52.050
Oh.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.093
-You hear about Bob Duncan?
-No, what about Bob Duncan?

16:02.095 --> 16:04.228
Crazy son of a bitch
drove hisself out past a point

16:04.230 --> 16:05.897
and did hisself in.

16:05.899 --> 16:07.131

16:07.133 --> 16:09.167

16:09.169 --> 16:11.169
Oh, that's awful.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.978

You got jam on here

16:30.757 --> 16:33.758
Oh, you missed
your group today.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.126
- That's tomorrow, eddy.
- Oh.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.161
Barb's picking me up
in the morning.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.763
Oh, I'll drive you.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.131
Barb likes to drive.

16:40.132 --> 16:41.498
Well, Barb doesn't like to keep
to her side

16:41.501 --> 16:42.767
of the fucking road anymore.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.269
Oh well, I'll keep an eye out.

16:48.775 --> 16:52.110
You'll ruin the deck, bug.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.212
Yeah, I think
I'll head into the fort,

16:54.214 --> 16:55.613

16:55.615 --> 16:57.482
Maybe you oughta drive him,
eddy.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.450
No, no,
I'll be fine, kiddo.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.387
As long as you didn't
tow my truck.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.222
Hey, you guys say hey
to the kid for me.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.656
Yeah, you behave yourself
out there.

17:05.657 --> 17:06.656
Oh yeah.

17:06.659 --> 17:10.194
Right on.

17:12.398 --> 17:14.398
Poor Bob.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.411
Rosario killed it last night,
hey?

17:26.413 --> 17:27.612
Huh?

17:27.613 --> 17:28.812
I said rosario killed it
last night, hey?

17:28.815 --> 17:30.848
She was brutal,
took his eyes you know,

17:30.850 --> 17:32.984
right through his skull.

17:33.319 --> 17:34.419
I didn't catch it.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.920
What the fuck you mean
you didn't catch it?

17:35.922 --> 17:40.158
Were you back at camp
jerking off, what?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.559
Were ya?

17:41.561 --> 17:43.628
No.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.696
No, don't even like
to give her a little tug.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.732
I just don't see
what's the point.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.300
What are you
some kind of eunuch

17:49.302 --> 17:52.670
or something?

17:52.671 --> 17:56.039
Of people beating on each other,
i mean it just seems pointless.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.076
The point is they make
a lot of money.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.444
You know,
the guy that he cracked

17:59.446 --> 18:01.212
looked a lot like you actually.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.347
Little more meat on him.

18:03.349 --> 18:04.282
All the same.

18:04.284 --> 18:07.885
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.588
What the fuck
are you doing here anyway?

18:12.525 --> 18:14.392
Well, you told me to unload.

18:14.394 --> 18:18.463
- Yeah, at the mud pump.
- Yeah.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.699
Back at the fucking entrance,
man.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.868
So I'm supposed
to hoof this shit from here

18:23.870 --> 18:26.337
all the way over there,
ruin my fucking back.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.005
Load it back up
get Andy to rip it

18:28.007 --> 18:29.557
around the other side.

18:29.558 --> 18:31.108
He said he had to leave
and then you needed them now,

18:31.111 --> 18:33.711
so I mean I'm unloading, but--

18:33.713 --> 18:35.513
but what?

18:35.515 --> 18:37.281
- What?
- I'll walk them.

18:37.283 --> 18:41.385
Yeah, you'll fucking walk them.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.073
He's upped her dose, eh?

19:02.075 --> 19:02.740
Oh.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.041
Nightmares might increase.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.543
She keeping you up as it is?

19:05.544 --> 19:07.044
Well, she's giving me
a good kick once in a while.

19:07.046 --> 19:09.914
Might have to sleep
in the kid's hockey pads.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.749
Not a bad idea.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.785
That'll run ya 575.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.822
Bleedin' me dry here, Margie.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.794
Boy, life is just all wrapped up
in itself, innit?

19:23.796 --> 19:25.263
How's that, ed?

19:25.265 --> 19:27.365
Well, I gotta spend the money
i made from the mill

19:27.367 --> 19:30.434
that's maybe killing my wife
just to buy the meds

19:30.436 --> 19:33.738
to stop the thing
from killing her faster.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.331
Jude?

20:34.734 --> 20:35.933
What happened, darling?

20:35.935 --> 20:36.901
My finger.

20:36.903 --> 20:40.438
I just need to take my ring off.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.608
Goddamnit.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.577
- Okay.
- Just be careful, bug.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.547
Okay, well, if you just stop
your wiggling for a second.

20:49.549 --> 20:50.848
I'll do my best.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.984
Here I go.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.359
You don't feel that.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.515
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, mom</i> .

21:24.517 --> 21:26.550
Hello you!

21:26.552 --> 21:28.686
Oh.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.571
You alright?

21:30.572 --> 21:32.455
Yeah, I just thought
I'd check in.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.492
The bugs eating you alive?

21:34.494 --> 21:35.926
<i> Yeah.</i>

21:35.928 --> 21:39.363
Oh, you sound tired.

21:39.365 --> 21:41.198
Who's he working with?

21:41.200 --> 21:43.134
Who are you working with now?

21:43.136 --> 21:45.269
<i> The drilling crew.</i>

21:45.271 --> 21:47.171
The drilling crew, yeah.

21:47.173 --> 21:50.408
That's gonna do it.

21:50.409 --> 21:53.644
Yeah, well, there is not much
to report here.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.181
You wanna talk to your dad?

21:57.183 --> 21:59.216
<i> Okay.</i>

22:04.057 --> 22:06.390
So you still got
all your fingers or...

22:07.493 --> 22:09.527
<i> Yeah.</i>

22:16.235 --> 22:19.136
Come on, let's mix that mud!

22:32.885 --> 22:34.352
Okay.

22:46.165 --> 22:48.566
Oye, guide that on there.

22:56.109 --> 23:00.611
When I was 14, my dog Nellie
caught a porcupine.

23:00.613 --> 23:03.681
I found her under the deck
all covered in quills

23:03.683 --> 23:06.350
on her muzzle
and all down her throat,

23:06.352 --> 23:09.253
on her tongue.

23:09.255 --> 23:12.022
I called dad out
and he grabbed her,

23:12.024 --> 23:13.657
he told me to hold her down

23:13.659 --> 23:17.595
and he started pulling
quills out with his pliers.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.864
But Nellie,
she's shaking all over,

23:19.866 --> 23:21.232
crying this high-pitched whine

23:21.234 --> 23:25.936
and I can't stand
hearing her like that.

23:25.938 --> 23:28.472
I'm not strong enough.

23:28.474 --> 23:31.642
So I let go for just a second

23:31.644 --> 23:35.246
and off she bolts
into the woods.

23:35.248 --> 23:38.082
She never came back.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.818
She never came back.

24:40.847 --> 24:45.616
Goddamnit, here we go.

24:48.921 --> 24:54.425
Yesterday, I was at field's
getting Harry some socks.

24:54.427 --> 24:59.330
So picture me there in the aisle
with all the delicates--

24:59.332 --> 25:01.298
delicate stuff.

25:01.300 --> 25:02.366
And I see the ones he likes

25:02.368 --> 25:04.902
just on the rack
over there to the left

25:04.904 --> 25:07.388
and I think,

25:07.389 --> 25:09.873
"okay, Nadine, so there they are
and they're on sale

25:09.876 --> 25:12.109
so let's get 'em
and get outta here."

25:12.111 --> 25:16.914
'Cause here comes Jim fleury,
just come in.

25:16.916 --> 25:20.184
And god knows, I do not want
to have to stand here

25:20.186 --> 25:24.221
and talk to him for 20 minutes
or half an hour

25:24.223 --> 25:28.425
about the kids
and their chicken pox."

25:29.362 --> 25:33.264
But what happens
when I try take a step

25:33.266 --> 25:37.001
is nothin',
nothin' happens.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.235
So I say to my legs,

25:38.237 --> 25:44.108
"this is not real,
you are working just fine,

25:44.110 --> 25:46.343
so move,
you goddamn useless things."

25:46.345 --> 25:48.712
But they just stick there,
stiff as the char

25:48.714 --> 25:51.982
I still got in my deep freeze
since last year.

25:51.984 --> 25:55.185
And then what do you know,
here comes Jim

25:55.187 --> 25:59.456
strollin' towards me sayin',
"hi there, Nadine.

25:59.458 --> 26:02.026
Down here
gettin' some socks for Harry,

26:02.028 --> 26:04.529
are ya?"

26:04.530 --> 26:07.031
And I wish to god
he would just leave me be,

26:07.033 --> 26:12.436
so I can concentrate
on movin' my fuckin' feet.

26:12.438 --> 26:16.340
You try throwing your keys
on the floor?

26:16.342 --> 26:17.875
What, I should throw my keys?

26:17.877 --> 26:18.943
Yeah, yeah.
- Why?

26:18.945 --> 26:20.678
Well, that's what I do.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.413
It wakes me up.

26:22.415 --> 26:25.783
Next time when Jim comes around,
I'll throw them at his head.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.754
Yeah.

26:30.756 --> 26:33.691
Hello,
I've been thinking lately about

26:33.693 --> 26:35.526
what coulda been different.

26:35.527 --> 26:37.360
Yeah, I know, I know that's not
a good way to think.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.347
I know.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.332
But this year will be
our 23rd year together,

26:41.334 --> 26:44.468
eddy and I, and only four
without this disease.

26:44.470 --> 26:46.537
That's 18 with,
four without.

26:46.539 --> 26:47.338
Yeah.

26:47.340 --> 26:49.073
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:49.075 --> 26:50.808
Yeah.

26:50.810 --> 26:56.013
We were together six months
when he proposed.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.748
I was so surprised.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.950
I said yes,
but then got nervous

26:59.952 --> 27:01.986
'cause I'd lied to him
about my age.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.654
He didn't know
i was five years older

27:03.656 --> 27:05.522
than I'd said.

27:05.524 --> 27:08.125
So a few days later,
i called up and I said,

27:08.127 --> 27:09.893
"look,
you might not wanna marry me.

27:09.895 --> 27:10.894
And he said...

27:11.864 --> 27:13.130
..."well, why's that?"

27:13.132 --> 27:15.232
And I say,
"'cause I'm actually 33."

27:15.234 --> 27:17.468
He said, "well, you'd better
stick with me then, old bag."

27:17.470 --> 27:20.204
And I said,
"okay, that sounds okay."

27:22.074 --> 27:26.443
He knew me then,
he knew what to say.

27:30.516 --> 27:32.016
And now?

27:32.018 --> 27:33.817
And now...

27:33.819 --> 27:38.455
Sometimes now
i feel like wearing--

27:38.457 --> 27:40.290
when they see me,
they don't see me,

27:40.292 --> 27:43.761
they see her.

27:43.763 --> 27:44.895
And I get so mad at him.

27:44.897 --> 27:47.798
It's not-- I'm still a woman,

27:47.800 --> 27:52.569
I'm still the same woman.

27:52.571 --> 27:54.838
And I just wonder,

27:54.840 --> 27:58.609
I just wonder
if he would've been happier?

27:58.611 --> 28:02.046
Happier, yeah.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.950
That's just marriage, honey.

28:06.952 --> 28:10.254
Shakes or not,
it's just marriage.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.569
Hey, hey.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.814
Eddy?

30:08.941 --> 30:11.308
No!

30:11.310 --> 30:13.177
No, no!

30:49.882 --> 30:53.150
Judy, kiddo, I'm gonna need you

30:53.152 --> 30:55.752
to call me the ambulance now,
okay?

31:02.561 --> 31:04.127
Hello?

31:09.635 --> 31:11.635
It's ed.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.570
Yeah.

31:23.782 --> 31:26.650
I used to dream of Jamie
being taken,

31:26.652 --> 31:31.488
taken straight out of my body.

31:31.490 --> 31:34.524
Ed would wake me,
"you were screaming,

31:34.526 --> 31:37.561
you were asleep and screaming."

31:37.563 --> 31:39.630
That was my medication.

31:39.632 --> 31:41.031
This is different.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.166
It is not a dream.

31:43.168 --> 31:44.368
It's a memory.

31:44.370 --> 31:47.337
It's a memory
that won't go away.

31:47.339 --> 31:50.007
Try to think of ed
in the days before,

31:50.009 --> 31:52.676
before any of it.

31:52.678 --> 31:58.048
I am full of memories,
i am full of hope,

31:58.050 --> 32:00.751
I am full of regrets.

32:18.771 --> 32:21.071
You wanted to see me, boss?

32:21.073 --> 32:23.507
Yeah, close the door.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.357
Watch where you're going, man.

33:36.115 --> 33:41.018
Would've been bored
out of his mind in there.

33:41.020 --> 33:44.021
Could've thrown in
a joke or two, right?

38:31.877 --> 38:33.843
More coffee?

38:33.845 --> 38:35.478
I'll get it.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.446
Fuck!

38:36.448 --> 38:39.949
Oh gosh.

38:39.951 --> 38:40.984
It's fine.

38:40.986 --> 38:43.153
Oh.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.789
Sorry.

38:51.163 --> 38:54.197
Getting a bit fat, eh?

38:54.199 --> 38:56.366
He is not.

38:56.368 --> 38:57.100
He is.

38:57.102 --> 38:58.134
Aren't you, buddy?

39:25.931 --> 39:26.730
Hello?

39:26.732 --> 39:29.399
<i> Hey man.</i>

39:29.401 --> 39:31.034
Hey.

39:31.036 --> 39:33.937
<i> How you doing?</i>

39:33.939 --> 39:36.206
I'm fine.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.975
<i> My mom told me.</i>

39:38.977 --> 39:43.179
<i> So just wanted to call</i>
<i> and say sorry.</i>

39:43.181 --> 39:47.917
<i> He was a good guy, your dad.</i>

39:47.919 --> 39:49.986
How's the city?

39:49.988 --> 39:52.088
<i> It's cool.</i>

39:52.090 --> 39:54.391
I'm starting school in the fall.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.192
Yeah, that's cool?

39:56.194 --> 39:58.628
What are you gonna take,
marine biology?

39:58.630 --> 39:59.863
<i> Fuck no.</i>

39:59.865 --> 40:01.498
<i> I'm taking psychology.</i>

40:01.500 --> 40:04.067
Psychology,
that sounds fucking boring man.

40:04.069 --> 40:09.172
Marine biology
would've been dope.

40:09.174 --> 40:11.041
You got an apartment down there?

40:11.042 --> 40:12.909
<i> Yeah, it's cramped as shit,</i>
though.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.812
<i> Walls are so thin</i>
i can hear my folks having sex,

40:15.814 --> 40:18.214
it's disgusting.

40:18.216 --> 40:21.384
Nice, nice.

40:21.386 --> 40:25.455
<i> You doin' okay on the lease?</i>

40:25.457 --> 40:28.191
Yeah, it's cool.

40:28.193 --> 40:31.594
My back is fucking ripped.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.464
<i> Yeah, right.</i>

40:34.466 --> 40:36.866
My boss's breath is like--

40:36.868 --> 40:37.967
it smells like a dog's ass,

40:37.969 --> 40:42.372
like something
just crawled in there and died.

40:42.374 --> 40:44.874
<i> What are you smelling</i>
his breath for?

40:44.876 --> 40:47.610
'Cause he's always pushing me
in my fucking face.

40:47.612 --> 40:50.180
<i> 'Cause you're slackin' off</i>
or what?

40:50.182 --> 40:52.348
No, 'cause he's an asshole.

40:52.350 --> 40:54.117
I'm worried he's gonna give me
some disease,

40:54.119 --> 40:58.955
like fucking aids
from his spit landing on me.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.157
You should see
the kind of girls he fucks,

41:01.159 --> 41:03.026
it's like--

41:03.028 --> 41:05.061
oh boy.

41:05.063 --> 41:08.231
So what you can't hack it then?

41:08.233 --> 41:10.166
Nah, I can take it.
http://worldmkv.com/

41:10.168 --> 41:13.903
<i> No sweat, eh?</i>

41:13.905 --> 41:15.905
No sweat.

41:19.678 --> 41:22.846
Maybe I'll come visit you
sometime.

41:22.848 --> 41:28.685
<i> So wait, is your mom alright?</i>

41:28.687 --> 41:31.888
Yeah, I was thinking about
getting a cell,

41:31.890 --> 41:35.024
so maybe you could give me
a call sometime

41:35.026 --> 41:39.395
and I can help you
with your homework and shit.

41:41.199 --> 41:44.467
A lot of fucking help you'd be.

42:59.344 --> 43:02.011
How's Danny?

43:04.149 --> 43:06.282
Hot-shit city kid now.

43:06.284 --> 43:09.519
Oh, I doubt that.

43:11.756 --> 43:15.391
I keep thinking
he must just be out in the bush,

43:15.393 --> 43:17.894
you know?

43:31.009 --> 43:33.142
You want me to stick around?

43:33.144 --> 43:33.943
No, no, no.

43:33.945 --> 43:36.212
You don't have to do that, no.

43:36.214 --> 43:38.881
No, you gotta live your life.

43:38.883 --> 43:44.687
He was so proud of you,
workin' so hard.

43:44.689 --> 43:47.223
Saving your money, are ya?

43:47.225 --> 43:48.257
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:48.259 --> 43:51.995
That's a good boy,
that's a good boy.

43:51.997 --> 43:54.731
Yeah.

45:17.449 --> 45:20.817
Because you're a child
and an idiot

45:20.819 --> 45:22.819
and because you see
in yourself a significance

45:22.821 --> 45:26.889
that is not there,
you wait until 2:00 A.M.,

45:26.891 --> 45:28.825
when alone at the tank
you get dramatic

45:28.827 --> 45:31.561
and try to punch yourself
in the head.

45:31.563 --> 45:34.530
You think of the kid
you called a retard in school,

45:34.532 --> 45:37.934
how he blackened his own eye
and if you're better

45:37.936 --> 45:42.772
than this place,
then why is this place so hard.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.683
Some might say that makes it
grade a.

45:53.685 --> 45:55.251
No man, that's not grade a,

45:55.253 --> 45:56.552
'cause if you're nutting
right away,

45:56.554 --> 45:59.021
that's the fault of pussy.

45:59.023 --> 46:01.290
So it's the fault of the pussy,
huh?

46:01.292 --> 46:02.842
Yeah.

46:02.843 --> 46:04.393
It's like that shit you know,
you don't wanna be the last.

46:04.395 --> 46:06.729
You won't be busting your nut
like in two minutes.

46:06.731 --> 46:09.766
Yeah, well, who said
i did that anyway, okay?

46:09.768 --> 46:11.134
I mean I don't know
where this guy

46:11.136 --> 46:12.636
is getting his information from?

46:12.637 --> 46:14.137
I'm just sayin
it's gotta be a perfect fit.

46:14.139 --> 46:16.038
Like you're not gonna
take a bite of fried rice

46:16.040 --> 46:17.707
and then be full all night
be satisfied.

46:17.709 --> 46:19.942
No man, you're gonna
be hungry again in an hour.

46:19.944 --> 46:21.060
It's the same thing.

46:21.061 --> 46:22.177
You wanna be able
to make your money last.

46:22.180 --> 46:23.279
You want to enjoy it, you know.

46:23.281 --> 46:25.148
It's like have
a perfect balance.

46:25.150 --> 46:26.449
Like your wife?

46:26.451 --> 46:27.784
Hey, you talk about
my fucking wife again,

46:27.786 --> 46:29.619
I'm gonna stick a chain tong
so far up your ass

46:29.621 --> 46:31.320
you can choke on your own shit,
boy!

46:31.322 --> 46:32.188
Hey, chill man.

46:32.190 --> 46:33.373
No, you chill, man.

46:33.374 --> 46:34.557
I've got the fucking
dune coon up my ass

46:34.559 --> 46:36.159
pissin' me off all night,
telling me

46:36.161 --> 46:37.226
how to do my fucking job.

46:37.228 --> 46:38.761
Like buddy, I get it,

46:38.762 --> 46:40.295
you guys have oil over there,
but this shit's gas.

46:40.298 --> 46:41.364
Don't come over here

46:41.365 --> 46:42.431
and tell me how to do my job,
man.

46:42.433 --> 46:44.734
That shit drives me
fucking crazy.

46:44.736 --> 46:46.736
I'm serious.

46:51.576 --> 46:54.310
So you gonna remember
which way's up tonight, kid?

46:54.312 --> 46:56.746
Hey, be careful, man,
he's been working out.

46:56.748 --> 46:58.364
Oh yeah.

46:58.365 --> 46:59.981
Pumping iron, getting stacked.

46:59.984 --> 47:01.717
Better keep your brother
on a leash, man,

47:01.719 --> 47:02.819
we got a shift coming on.

47:02.821 --> 47:03.953
Uh, it helps him unwind.

47:03.955 --> 47:07.523
It fucking winds him up
more like.

47:07.525 --> 47:09.592
I'll talk to him.

47:09.594 --> 47:12.929
Yo, let's take a walk.

47:45.697 --> 47:49.165
Okay, here you go.

49:56.427 --> 49:57.927
"Now my dears,"

49:57.928 --> 49:59.428
said old mrs rabbit
one morning,

49:59.430 --> 50:02.598
"you may go into the fields
or down the Lane,

50:02.600 --> 50:05.434
but don't go into
Mr. McGregor's garden.

50:05.436 --> 50:08.738
Your father
had an accident there;

50:08.740 --> 50:13.709
and he was put in a pie
by Mrs. McGregor."

50:13.711 --> 50:16.278
Sorry.

50:21.686 --> 50:25.354
"If he had not unfortunately
run into a gooseberry

50:25.356 --> 50:27.356
and got caught
by the large buttons

50:27.358 --> 50:28.524
in his jacket.

50:28.526 --> 50:34.663
It was a blue jacket then
with brass buttons.

50:34.665 --> 50:36.132
Quite new.

50:36.134 --> 50:37.967
So that'll be $50.50.

50:37.969 --> 50:39.935
Please.

50:51.416 --> 50:53.349
There you go.

51:01.859 --> 51:02.591
Afternoon.

51:02.593 --> 51:04.827
Afternoon, yeah.

51:10.268 --> 51:12.668
Do you need any help
with your bags today?

51:12.670 --> 51:15.538
No, no, I'm fine.

51:20.244 --> 51:23.913
You know we've got
a new home delivery service.

51:23.915 --> 51:25.981
If you ever need it.

52:08.059 --> 52:12.194
You're doing quite
a bit of swerving back up there.

52:12.663 --> 52:15.564
You had anything to drink today?

52:15.566 --> 52:18.434
No sir...

52:18.436 --> 52:22.505
I just need to take
my medication.

52:22.507 --> 52:25.107
You got your medicine with you?

52:25.109 --> 52:27.776
Yeah.

52:30.848 --> 52:33.048
Alright ma'am.

52:33.050 --> 52:35.951
I'm gonna ask you
to do something, okay.

52:35.953 --> 52:37.853
For your own safety.

52:37.855 --> 52:40.389
I am gonna ask you to stay
off the road from now on
http://worldmkv.com/

52:40.391 --> 52:43.425
unless you've taken
all your medicine.

52:43.427 --> 52:46.795
Will you do that for me?

52:46.797 --> 52:48.931
Yeah.

52:48.933 --> 52:51.033
And I don't think
you should be drivin'

52:51.035 --> 52:54.403
when you're upset either.

52:54.405 --> 52:55.337
Just take some time

52:55.339 --> 52:58.107
get yourself
back on the road.

53:33.211 --> 53:36.745
Makin' a break for it, are ya?

53:40.151 --> 53:42.952
I've forgotten how to swim.

53:42.954 --> 53:44.954
Guess I won't Chuck you in then.

53:48.726 --> 53:56.065
Every year more cabins,
more fucking ski-doos.

53:56.200 --> 53:58.384
How'd you like it

53:58.385 --> 54:00.569
if I ski-dooed
over your grave eh?

54:01.639 --> 54:06.475
Ah shit.

54:06.477 --> 54:08.544
Not too cold you think?

54:08.546 --> 54:10.913
You think he feels cold, len?

54:10.915 --> 54:13.415
No, I don't think so, Jude.

54:30.534 --> 54:35.104
Sister Mary-Frances
could see us now, eh?

54:35.640 --> 54:39.041
Rolling in her grave no doubt.

54:44.382 --> 54:46.448
You know, I think
she'd take one look at you

54:46.450 --> 54:48.117
and she'd say,

54:48.119 --> 54:54.657
"kiddo, how do you stay so tough
through all this shit?"

54:55.993 --> 54:58.794
That's what she should say.

55:06.070 --> 55:09.104
You just disappeared.

55:09.106 --> 55:11.440
You missed the funeral.

55:14.712 --> 55:17.813
I'm not a strong man
that way, Judy.

55:23.187 --> 55:25.587
Just never been.

59:12.483 --> 59:13.348
Paychecks.

59:13.350 --> 59:14.983
Nice, thanks.

59:14.985 --> 59:17.920
You alright?

59:17.922 --> 59:19.087
Yeah.

59:19.089 --> 59:21.557
Always feel like
a trapped animal out here

59:21.559 --> 59:24.459
in the winter.

59:24.461 --> 59:25.427
Night.

59:25.429 --> 59:28.163
Alright, see you in the morning,
man.

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:18.914
Oho, hey.

01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:23.552
Hey, we don't need much, eh?

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:56.218
Hi ma'am.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:57.169
Hello there.

01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:58.119
Got your groceries.

01:00:58.122 --> 01:01:00.355
Ooh, it must be -30!

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:03.458
Quick, come on in.

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:06.995
Oh, hey you.

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:07.829
Hey beautiful.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:09.765
You surviving out there?

01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:11.333
It's got some bite today.

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:13.335
I bet, yeah.

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:15.120
My kettle just boiled.

01:01:15.121 --> 01:01:16.904
You stay and have a cup
if you like.

01:01:16.907 --> 01:01:19.841
Best thing I heard all day.

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:28.016
You live out here on your own?

01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:31.153
Uh, I just...

01:01:31.155 --> 01:01:33.355
It's quiet, it must be nice.

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:35.524
Yeah, here.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:41.997
You sit for a minute,
warm yourself up.

01:01:44.835 --> 01:01:47.235
Hey you.

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:53.408
What can I call you?

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:54.176
Kaly.

01:01:54.178 --> 01:01:56.578
Sometimes kal.

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:59.181
Huh, call me Jude then.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:14.062
It's uh, 42.50 yeah?

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:23.538
Mhmm.

01:02:25.743 --> 01:02:29.144
There-- there's a tip in there
for you.

01:02:29.146 --> 01:02:30.879
Thank you.

01:02:30.881 --> 01:02:32.280
Yeah.
- Here.

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:34.015
Yes, it's good to see,
having you come out here,

01:02:34.017 --> 01:02:36.151
'cause I don't like to drive
in the snow anymore.

01:02:36.153 --> 01:02:37.486
You know, the smaller boy
who came before,

01:02:37.488 --> 01:02:41.590
I thought, "boy, he's not
even old enough to drive."

01:02:41.592 --> 01:02:43.575
Just barely.

01:02:43.576 --> 01:02:45.559
Yeah, you need a license
for those things?

01:02:45.562 --> 01:02:47.629
No.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.868
Is this your husband?

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:55.837
I've seen him at the store,
before.

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:58.173
Oh, he's passed now.

01:03:04.348 --> 01:03:06.581
You have any kids?

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:07.315
A boy.

01:03:07.317 --> 01:03:08.917
A little older than you maybe.

01:03:08.919 --> 01:03:10.685
I'm 17.

01:03:10.687 --> 01:03:12.053
Yeah, yeah, a little older then.

01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:13.488
I'm havin' a baby myself.

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:15.023
Oh!

01:03:15.025 --> 01:03:17.926
Wow, wow.

01:03:17.928 --> 01:03:24.466
Yeah, that's wonderful, kal.

01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:25.534
A lot of work though.

01:03:25.536 --> 01:03:27.803
You have a family here
to help you out?

01:03:27.805 --> 01:03:29.104
I'm stayin' with
my foster parents

01:03:29.106 --> 01:03:31.006
- until my birthday.
- Huh.

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:34.409
And my boyfriend, he's got a job
and stuff.

01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:37.112
Yeah?

01:03:37.114 --> 01:03:40.382
Sky, I'm callin' it,
after my mom.

01:03:40.384 --> 01:03:44.219
It works for a boy or a girl,
either way.

01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:48.924
Yeah, it's a lovely name.

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:50.376
My foster mom,

01:03:50.377 --> 01:03:51.827
she says maybe
it'll be quick for me,

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:53.912
won't hurt too much.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:55.996
They always show in the movies
the women screaming like that,

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:59.568
but she says it's not
really like that,

01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:04.539
but she's never had kids
herself eh, so.

01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:06.541
Yeah, my boy took 18 hours.

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:08.844
18 hours!

01:04:08.846 --> 01:04:10.445
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, he was a stubborn one.

01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:13.215
You can tell like that, eh,
right from the get-go.

01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:15.217
But you know, when it's over,

01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:19.588
to hold them,
you can't imagine the joy.

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:21.790
I know, I know it will be.

01:04:21.792 --> 01:04:22.891
I can feel it.

01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:26.828
Yeah, a bit of sadness too,
yeah,

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:28.029
in what you feel.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:30.131
For me anyway.

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:31.833
Maybe you know,
giving this new life

01:04:31.835 --> 01:04:35.904
setting them out there
in the world, you know

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:40.442
your own body
gives something up for it.

01:04:40.444 --> 01:04:42.811
But you know,
then there's this darn thing

01:04:42.813 --> 01:04:46.414
in front of you,
and then you're in for it.

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:48.183
You know, you say,
"okay, yeah,

01:04:48.185 --> 01:04:51.353
I'll give it my best shot, eh?"

01:04:51.355 --> 01:04:53.755
Yeah.

01:04:58.662 --> 01:05:01.763
I'd better get back out there,
before it gets dark.

01:05:01.765 --> 01:05:05.066
Smart girl you are.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:09.571
Yeah, you stay warm out there.

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:11.640
Take care ma'am,
see you next week.

01:05:11.642 --> 01:05:13.775
Call me Judy, dear.

01:05:19.816 --> 01:05:22.083
17.

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:24.185
Jeepers.

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:38.700
Come on man, I am.

01:05:38.702 --> 01:05:40.268
I'm fucking trying.

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.671
Fuck man.

01:05:57.321 --> 01:05:59.154
It's not your fucking
boyfriend's dick, man,

01:05:59.156 --> 01:06:02.190
use the fucking thing,
let's go.

01:06:03.694 --> 01:06:04.927
Swear to god.

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:06.161
You're fucking killing us
out here.

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:07.395
You want to be working all
fucking night.

01:06:07.397 --> 01:06:08.530
Is that what you want?

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:09.664
You wanna work
till fucking dawn?

01:06:09.666 --> 01:06:11.733
You wanna be at work
and watching the sunrise

01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:13.134
come up together?

01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:14.102
Huh?

01:06:14.104 --> 01:06:15.470
I'll trade you
for that fucking bitch

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:16.571
on temp in a heartbeat.

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:18.340
Get to fucking work.

01:06:18.342 --> 01:06:19.374
Where the fuck are you going?

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:22.310
Get the fuck back up there.

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:24.245
Get your fucking ass
back up there and get to work.

01:06:24.247 --> 01:06:26.581
I'm not gonna wait
for your bitch ass all night.

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:27.449
Huh, get the fuck--

01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:29.050
are you fucking crying, huh?

01:06:29.052 --> 01:06:30.685
You'll freeze
your eyelid's shut,

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:32.020
rip your fucking eyelashes out.

01:06:32.022 --> 01:06:33.322
Is that what you want?

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:34.623
Get your goddamn fucking
disgusting ass breath

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:35.924
in my face all the time.
- The fuck it is!

01:06:35.926 --> 01:06:37.258
It stinks worse
than your mom's cunt!

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:38.693
Watch your fucking mouth
on that.

01:06:38.695 --> 01:06:40.762
I'll knock your teeth out,
right?

01:06:44.001 --> 01:06:45.300
Daryl!

01:06:45.302 --> 01:06:47.268
Daryl.
What the fuck, Daryl!

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:49.137
Daryl!

01:07:05.956 --> 01:07:08.857
He was just smashing
the kid with...

01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:12.727
They just jumped in
at the wrong time.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:25.540
You have any family around here?

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:30.045
My mum's she's out west,
near prince.

01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:33.381
She's on her own.

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:38.353
Well,
my folks are in grand prairie.

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:44.025
Just need some piss, boys,
then you can go.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:37.212
It's freezing.

01:08:37.214 --> 01:08:41.082
It fucking stinks in here.

01:08:42.252 --> 01:08:44.419
You got any money?

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:04.706
You gonna sit?

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:08.676
Yeah, I guess
I'm just gonna sit here.

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:16.578
That's it?

01:10:35.165 --> 01:10:37.065
That's it.

01:10:37.067 --> 01:10:39.467
That's all.

01:10:42.606 --> 01:10:44.472
You're welcome.

01:11:34.691 --> 01:11:37.292
Christ, shit!

01:11:44.067 --> 01:11:46.234
Fuck!

01:14:25.228 --> 01:14:26.727
Hey.
- Oh, Jamie.

01:14:26.729 --> 01:14:28.362
Surprise.

01:14:28.364 --> 01:14:31.899
Jamie, what are you doing?

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:33.901
Oh, thank goodness.

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:36.737
Jamie.

01:14:36.739 --> 01:14:39.507
My pipes are frozen solid.

01:14:39.509 --> 01:14:40.508
Did you call a plumber?

01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:42.026
Oh, who can afford a plumber?

01:14:42.027 --> 01:14:43.543
I'd ask bud next door,
but he's such a pervert

01:14:43.546 --> 01:14:45.813
you know, he looks at me funny.

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:48.049
I just thought well, you know,
I'll just get down there

01:14:48.051 --> 01:14:49.517
with the iron myself,

01:14:49.519 --> 01:14:50.885
but you know,
i burned my hand a touch,

01:14:50.887 --> 01:14:57.225
so to hell with it I said,
I'll use the outhouse.

01:15:05.735 --> 01:15:07.335
Where's goose?

01:15:07.337 --> 01:15:08.820
You wipe him down

01:15:08.821 --> 01:15:10.304
before you let him in here,
mister.

01:15:10.306 --> 01:15:11.539
Yeah.

01:15:11.541 --> 01:15:13.674
Oh my.

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:15.877
Oh Jamie.

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:45.573
You notice when it does that?

01:15:45.575 --> 01:15:47.942
Yes.

01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:52.480
What does it feel like?

01:15:52.482 --> 01:15:54.982
Oh...

01:15:54.984 --> 01:15:59.153
Like someone's pulling at it
or is it...

01:15:59.155 --> 01:16:03.257
But I'm doing the pulling
and the being pulled.

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:10.231
When I was a kid I was sure
i could switch it off,

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:11.933
'cause I'd put my hand
on your foot

01:16:11.935 --> 01:16:14.735
and it would stop.

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:26.581
What?

01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:29.116
You just seem older.

01:16:32.989 --> 01:16:35.256
I am.

01:17:11.361 --> 01:17:13.427
That your son out there?

01:17:13.429 --> 01:17:15.096
Jamie, yeah.

01:17:15.098 --> 01:17:18.966
You're a single mom now, eh?

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:20.668
I guess so.

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.326
Hey.

01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:47.328
Hey.

01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:50.598
You work at the overweightea?

01:17:52.268 --> 01:17:54.035
How do they pay there?

01:17:54.037 --> 01:17:56.037
10 an hour.

01:17:56.039 --> 01:17:57.171
Shit.

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:59.824
And a discount.

01:17:59.825 --> 01:18:02.476
Sometimes free stuff
if it's gonna go to waste.

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:07.381
I like your boots.

01:18:07.383 --> 01:18:09.517
Thanks.

01:18:16.659 --> 01:18:18.225
You want one?

01:18:18.227 --> 01:18:19.360
I quit.

01:18:19.362 --> 01:18:21.295
Okay.

01:18:30.606 --> 01:18:32.540
See ya.

01:19:18.855 --> 01:19:21.055
Shoot.

01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:23.357
Oh shoot, shoot.

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:33.934
Jamie, can you head in
and pick up my pills

01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:35.402
before they close?

01:19:35.404 --> 01:19:37.505
Sure, just give me a minute.

01:19:37.507 --> 01:19:40.508
Yeah, yeah, I'll call it in.

01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:42.376
Okay.

01:20:19.515 --> 01:20:23.250
<i> Hey, you've reached Danny,</i>
leave a message.

01:21:12.568 --> 01:21:14.535
Hey.

01:21:14.537 --> 01:21:17.037
Hello.

01:21:28.384 --> 01:21:30.618
Can I get you anything?

01:21:34.323 --> 01:21:37.024
You got a break coming up?

01:21:38.561 --> 01:21:41.428
You want my coat?

01:21:41.931 --> 01:21:44.598
You got a boyfriend?

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.401
Sort of.

01:21:48.471 --> 01:21:50.237
Sort of?

01:21:54.877 --> 01:21:56.844
Shit, okay.

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:03.450
You like to fool around?

01:22:03.452 --> 01:22:05.586
No.

01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:07.688
Why not?

01:22:07.690 --> 01:22:13.627
'Cause I got better things
to do.

01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:16.030
Like what?

01:22:16.032 --> 01:22:19.033
I got things to take care of.

01:22:19.035 --> 01:22:21.602
Like what?

01:22:21.604 --> 01:22:23.203
Work and shit.

01:22:23.205 --> 01:22:25.606
School.

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:27.908
Other stuff.

01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:30.744
What other stuff?

01:22:30.746 --> 01:22:33.247
I'm havin' a baby.

01:22:33.249 --> 01:22:35.683
You're having a baby?

01:22:35.685 --> 01:22:36.784
Shit.

01:22:36.786 --> 01:22:38.919
You're too young to have a baby.

01:22:38.921 --> 01:22:42.923
Says you.

01:22:42.925 --> 01:22:44.825
What grade are you in?

01:22:44.827 --> 01:22:46.293
11.

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:48.062
11.

01:22:48.064 --> 01:22:50.631
Bet you get good grades.

01:22:50.633 --> 01:22:52.833
I bet you're smart, eh?

01:22:52.835 --> 01:22:54.001
Huh?

01:22:54.003 --> 01:22:57.738
I bet you're smart.

01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:03.644
Not smart enough
to use protection though.

01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:06.246
You don't know anything.

01:23:20.563 --> 01:23:23.364
Can I see you later?

01:23:25.868 --> 01:23:30.371
Your sort-of boyfriend be mad?

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:33.474
So why not?

01:23:33.476 --> 01:23:36.543
I don't know.

01:23:36.545 --> 01:23:37.644
Just to talk.

01:23:37.646 --> 01:23:39.980
I like talkin' to you.

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:42.583
Do you like talkin' to me?

01:24:45.714 --> 01:24:46.680
Hey.

01:24:46.682 --> 01:24:47.848
Hey.

01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:51.552
Where to?

01:24:51.554 --> 01:24:53.954
Boat launch?

01:24:53.956 --> 01:24:58.492
I got you something.

01:24:59.395 --> 01:25:01.161
Merry Christmas.

01:25:01.163 --> 01:25:03.263
Thanks.

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:06.700
What happened
to your windshield?

01:25:06.702 --> 01:25:08.836
Uh, I smashed it.

01:25:08.838 --> 01:25:11.438
Why?

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.575
That's pretty stupid.

01:25:14.577 --> 01:25:16.477
Yeah.

01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:16.136
You like living here?

01:26:16.138 --> 01:26:18.972
Not really.

01:26:18.974 --> 01:26:22.376
You'll probably go to college
and stuff, yeah?

01:26:22.378 --> 01:26:24.978
I hope so.

01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:32.619
My buddy Danny,
he goes to college.

01:26:32.621 --> 01:26:34.755
You know him?

01:26:39.395 --> 01:26:41.461
You don't like girls, do you?

01:26:41.463 --> 01:26:43.664
No.

01:26:43.666 --> 01:26:46.266
You like me?

01:26:51.273 --> 01:26:53.574
I don't know.

01:26:53.576 --> 01:26:55.642
How old are you?

01:26:55.644 --> 01:26:57.578
20.

01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:59.813
You think that's hot?

01:26:59.815 --> 01:27:01.548
Not really.

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:04.484
It's kinda sad actually.

01:27:04.486 --> 01:27:07.554
Sad?

01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:09.957
What's sad about being 20?

01:27:09.959 --> 01:27:13.393
It's sad you're picking up
high school girls.

01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:17.497
High school girls like you?

01:27:17.499 --> 01:27:22.002
Who says I'm picking you up?

01:27:22.137 --> 01:27:24.438
You want me to pick you up?

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:27.341
I don't know.

01:27:27.343 --> 01:27:30.711
I'm 19 actually.

01:27:30.713 --> 01:27:33.447
But you've been with
20-year-olds before, eh?

01:27:33.449 --> 01:27:35.816
Yeah.

01:27:35.818 --> 01:27:36.850
You have?

01:27:36.852 --> 01:27:37.651
Yeah.

01:27:37.653 --> 01:27:40.487
You lie all the time or what?

01:27:47.329 --> 01:27:49.496
What'd you do with them?

01:27:49.498 --> 01:27:52.132
I don't know.

01:27:53.068 --> 01:27:55.636
Show me.

01:27:55.638 --> 01:27:57.371
Why not?

01:27:57.373 --> 01:28:00.974
You didn't like it?

01:28:07.349 --> 01:28:09.116
You ever done anything
with a girl?

01:28:09.118 --> 01:28:10.584
No.

01:28:10.586 --> 01:28:13.487
So how do you know
you don't like girls?

01:28:13.489 --> 01:28:15.322
I just know.

01:28:15.324 --> 01:28:17.958
Do you like boys?

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.726
You've been with a guy?

01:28:19.728 --> 01:28:21.495
No.

01:28:21.496 --> 01:28:23.263
You haven't even been
with a girl I bet.

01:28:23.265 --> 01:28:25.849
Hmm?

01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:28.434
You haven't even been
with a girl I bet.

01:28:28.437 --> 01:28:31.071
Shit, I've been with a girl.

01:28:31.073 --> 01:28:34.474
Why would you say that?

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:38.912
You're weird.

01:28:40.049 --> 01:28:43.283
My buddy Danny,
he's gay for sure.

01:28:43.285 --> 01:28:45.285
That's cool.

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:47.521
But you two never...

01:28:47.523 --> 01:28:51.124
No, no.
Shit, no.

01:28:52.027 --> 01:28:54.895
Seems like
you're pretty curious.

01:28:54.897 --> 01:29:00.934
I mean I guess
i thought about it.

01:29:03.605 --> 01:29:07.874
But more like I wanted to feel
how he felt like--

01:29:07.876 --> 01:29:11.678
like you know,
sometimes he just...

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:15.382
He just looked at me you know,

01:29:15.384 --> 01:29:16.817
like--

01:29:16.819 --> 01:29:20.821
shit, you know, no one ever
looks at me like that ever?

01:29:20.823 --> 01:29:22.923
Ever.

01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:29.262
I get that.

01:29:33.569 --> 01:29:37.904
You're cool kaly.

01:29:37.906 --> 01:29:40.407
Cool kaly.

01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:46.913
You work with
just guys on the rigs?

01:29:46.915 --> 01:29:53.019
There's some ladies
in the office, but yeah mostly.

01:29:54.623 --> 01:29:57.691
Do you have a girlfriend?

01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:06.032
I got a few,
but nothing serious.

01:30:06.034 --> 01:30:08.135
Hmm.

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:13.373
You like it up there?

01:30:21.817 --> 01:30:23.850
Your hands are cold.

01:30:23.852 --> 01:30:26.186
Sorry.

01:30:30.826 --> 01:30:33.660
Where's your baby's daddy?

01:30:33.662 --> 01:30:37.130
He went up north to the mines.

01:30:38.867 --> 01:30:41.601
Is he coming back?

01:30:46.975 --> 01:30:49.976
I think he got scared.

01:30:50.612 --> 01:30:53.046
You're not scared?

01:30:54.349 --> 01:30:57.150
I'm scared all the time.

01:30:59.655 --> 01:31:02.055
What for?

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.260
Getting left.

01:31:10.165 --> 01:31:12.132
Or leaving.

01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:16.803
Or not leaving.

01:31:18.841 --> 01:31:25.378
My mom she got this thing
with her brain.

01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:26.680
When I was a kid
i always thought

01:31:26.682 --> 01:31:32.285
she was like real tall you know.

01:31:32.287 --> 01:31:34.020
And now she's so tiny.

01:31:34.022 --> 01:31:37.090
It kinda freaks me out.

01:31:37.092 --> 01:31:40.494
But you were just shorter.

01:31:40.496 --> 01:31:45.699
Yeah, I guess
i was pretty short, yeah.

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:41.755
Just gently.

01:32:56.371 --> 01:32:59.573
Faster.

01:33:23.999 --> 01:33:26.232
I'm sorry.

01:33:26.234 --> 01:33:27.767
I'm sorry.

01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:30.136
What for?

01:33:30.138 --> 01:33:31.905
Did I mess it up?

01:33:31.907 --> 01:33:33.773
No.

01:33:33.775 --> 01:33:36.977
Did it feel okay to you?

01:33:39.147 --> 01:33:42.082
Are you kidding?

01:34:33.735 --> 01:34:37.003
Jamie?

01:34:39.007 --> 01:34:40.306
Yeah?

01:34:40.308 --> 01:34:43.276
Can you come in here?

01:34:48.984 --> 01:34:51.317
What's wrong?

01:34:51.319 --> 01:34:54.287
I can't get up.

01:34:54.289 --> 01:34:57.090
You have to help me.

01:35:17.045 --> 01:35:19.579
The water's freezing, mom.

01:35:34.896 --> 01:35:36.396
Pills.

01:35:36.398 --> 01:35:38.932
Pills?

01:35:49.611 --> 01:35:50.944
Which one.

01:35:50.946 --> 01:35:52.712
That?

01:35:55.016 --> 01:35:56.750
This one?

01:36:02.290 --> 01:36:04.824
Get some water.

01:36:27.482 --> 01:36:28.815
I'm sorry.

01:36:28.817 --> 01:36:32.185
Oh!

01:36:32.187 --> 01:36:33.620
No.

01:36:33.622 --> 01:36:34.721
I'm such a fuck up mom.

01:36:34.723 --> 01:36:37.657
- I am sorry.
- No, no, no.

01:36:37.659 --> 01:36:40.493
No, Jamie, no, no.

01:36:40.495 --> 01:36:43.763
Shh.

01:36:43.765 --> 01:36:45.431
It was my fault.

01:36:45.433 --> 01:36:47.767
Not your fault.

01:36:47.769 --> 01:36:50.603
Shhh.

01:36:50.605 --> 01:36:52.005
No, no.

01:36:52.007 --> 01:36:54.674
Tell me what's hurting.

01:37:00.582 --> 01:37:03.449
I don't want--

01:37:03.451 --> 01:37:06.653
I don't want to go back.

01:37:07.589 --> 01:37:12.192
It's not a very nice life
out there, is it?

01:37:13.929 --> 01:37:15.662
Are you warming up?

01:37:15.664 --> 01:37:16.729
Are you okay?

01:37:16.731 --> 01:37:20.800
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:37:20.802 --> 01:37:22.402
Why, why?

01:37:22.404 --> 01:37:26.239
This isn't how
it's supposed to be.
