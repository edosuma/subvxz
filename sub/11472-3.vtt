00:02.102 --> 00:03.469
All right.
Here's the bet.

00:03.937 --> 00:05.806
For 10 bucks

00:05.839 --> 00:07.473
I drink this much
of anything.

00:08.642 --> 00:09.676
Anything?

00:10.711 --> 00:11.878
Anything.

00:11.912 --> 00:13.947
As long as
it's something
you can eat.

00:13.980 --> 00:15.315
Okay, only stuff
from the kitchen.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.250
Nothing from the bathroom
and nothing from the garage.

00:17.283 --> 00:18.251
Okay.

00:18.284 --> 00:20.420
And it has to be food, okay?

00:20.453 --> 00:22.022
Nothing from under
the sink.

00:22.055 --> 00:24.224
Okay? No cleansers,
no detergent.

00:24.257 --> 00:28.494
No furniture polish
and no cut up bits of sponge.

00:29.495 --> 00:30.764
Okay.

00:30.797 --> 00:33.233
I'm just trying
to win 10 bucks here.
I don't wanna die.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.169
All right, now put on...

00:36.937 --> 00:38.572
The blindfold.

00:40.006 --> 00:41.508
I don't want to
mess up my hair.

00:43.243 --> 00:45.478
All right.
And now step into

00:45.512 --> 00:47.280
the sound proof booth.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.519
I'm trusting you guys.

00:56.489 --> 00:58.491
Okay, put in some mustard.
It's an ipecac.

00:58.525 --> 00:59.593
It'll make him barf.

00:59.626 --> 01:03.229
Don't make him barf.
My mom cooks dinner in here!

01:03.263 --> 01:04.765
If we're not trying
to make him barf,

01:04.798 --> 01:06.567
then why are we
doing this?

01:06.600 --> 01:09.503
I can hear everything
you guys are saying.

01:09.536 --> 01:12.005
Come on, Bill!
Quit listening!

01:12.038 --> 01:13.239
I can't help it.

01:13.273 --> 01:15.408

you can't hear us.

of pickle juice.

01:30.223 --> 01:32.726
He had to sit
on the toilet
for 10 hours.

a 20‐cent pumpkin,

But you went out last year.

05:04.538 --> 05:07.007
Yeah. Well, last year
I was in junior high.

Yeah, but Sam...

Honey, the boy's 14.

He can miss a night
of walking around
the neighborhood

beggin' like a tramp.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.449
Halloween's for little
kids anyway.

Hey, Lindsay,

05:18.484 --> 05:20.086
you're still gonna hand out
candy with me, aren't you?

05:20.120 --> 05:21.655
Remember how much
fun we had last year

05:21.688 --> 05:24.090
looking at
all the little kids
in their costumes?

05:24.124 --> 05:26.059
Yeah, Mom. I told you
I was going to.

05:26.092 --> 05:27.861
Well, good!

a really good time this year,

Long time no see.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.708
I saw you out here
yesterday.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.744

wearing a hat?

It's the day before
Halloween.

05:46.479 --> 05:47.681
That your costume?

05:48.214 --> 05:49.282
It kinda sucks.

05:49.315 --> 05:52.352
No. It's Devil's Day.

05:52.385 --> 05:54.855
Each year, the seniors
bring a hair removal foam

05:54.888 --> 05:56.990
and spray it on
freshmen's heads.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.625
Then all your hair
falls out.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.660
Really?

05:59.693 --> 06:03.396
No. That stupid rumor's
been around for years.

Hey, Millie.

What are you doing
tomorrow night?

06:16.342 --> 06:17.978
My church is having
a Halloween dance.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.045
You wanna come?

06:19.079 --> 06:21.548
Oh. Well...
I would go,

06:21.582 --> 06:24.217
but I gotta hand out
candy with my mom.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.920
Oh. Okay.

06:30.156 --> 06:31.191
Do you want
some Liqamate?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.727
No. You eat
candy now?

06:33.760 --> 06:35.896
Millie, it's 7:30
in the morning.

06:36.496 --> 06:38.398
It's just Liqamate.

06:38.431 --> 06:40.701

taste like fruit juice.

the same bus stop
since kindergarten.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.560
How fast does
your car go?

07:07.460 --> 07:10.030

the nitrous tank.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.800

07:13.834 --> 07:15.602
My dad says you
need a muffler.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.905
Once he even threw a rock
at you when you drove by.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.743
But... I guess
you didn't hear it.

07:23.409 --> 07:24.945
He threw a rock
at me?

are you eating?

want some?

a ride, Linds,

block in the backseat.

What does that mean?

08:29.175 --> 08:32.378
Well, you head to class,
but you never seem
to get there.

08:32.412 --> 08:36.550

humiliate me in front of
the whole school?

don't turn me into
the man here.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.655

to help you.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.591
And if, when you
graduate, it turns
out I did help you

08:44.625 --> 08:47.661
but you hate me,
I'm okay with that.

08:47.694 --> 08:48.829

08:52.232 --> 08:53.734
Embarrassing.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.469

I can think of

to describe these books
you've chosen to do
your reports on.

09:02.142 --> 09:07.681

<i>to Stupid Questions.</i>

09:07.714 --> 09:11.652

of <i>Star Wars.</i>

09:12.452 --> 09:14.387
<i>Yes I Can,</i>

09:14.420 --> 09:18.224
the autobiography
of Sammy Davis, Jr.

09:21.027 --> 09:24.565
Crime and Punishment
is a good example

09:24.598 --> 09:27.701
of the kind of book
you should be reading now.

09:28.334 --> 09:32.172
In it, Fyodor Dostoevsky

09:32.205 --> 09:34.107
was attempting to create

09:34.140 --> 09:36.076
what some would call

09:36.109 --> 09:38.745
an existential enigma...

09:40.547 --> 09:44.350
A protagonist who was
both a nihilist

09:44.384 --> 09:46.286
and a moralist.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.856
Now, I know this sounds
confusing to you all,

09:49.890 --> 09:53.660
but soon you'll all know
what I'm talking about,

09:53.694 --> 09:55.729
because I expect you to have

09:55.762 --> 09:58.965
the first half of
this book read by Monday.

make out with my butt,
and we'll call it love?

Saw him smoking
a "J" outside
the Quick Fill

10:33.667 --> 10:35.736
and went inside
and told some cops?

10:36.803 --> 10:39.105
Brian's in
prison now, man.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.374
And I heard
his brother's
lookin' for you.

10:41.407 --> 10:43.710
What? I didn't do that.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.482
Yeah. I know.

10:49.516 --> 10:52.052
I was just
messing with you.

10:52.085 --> 10:55.488
She got me with
that same joke
last week.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.123
It's kinda funny, though.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.160
Hilarious.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.062
NICK: Hey,
what are you doin'
for Halloween?

11:02.095 --> 11:04.931
Oh, I have to
hand out candy
with my mom.

11:04.965 --> 11:08.134
I know,
it sounds really dorky.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.504
She gets really
into it.

11:10.537 --> 11:11.772
Oh, Lindsay,

11:11.805 --> 11:14.608
I don't think
that sounds
dorky at all.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.643
You know what?
At least she's bein' nice.

11:16.677 --> 11:17.978
Just because you
hate your mother

11:18.011 --> 11:19.980
doesn't mean that
everybody else does, okay?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.782
No, everybody
hates her mother.

11:21.815 --> 11:22.883
(KIM LAUGHING)

11:22.916 --> 11:24.217
Well, what are you
guys doing?

11:24.250 --> 11:27.253
DANIEL: Oh, well, uh, Kim,
Nick and I are goin' out.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.657
Borrow my uncle's
big‐ass Caddy, and...

11:30.691 --> 11:32.358
We thought maybe
you'd like to come with us.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.830
Oh, you mean like
a double date?

11:38.064 --> 11:41.001
If that's what
you need to call it
in your diary, princess.

11:43.269 --> 11:44.270
I can't.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.172
Your loss.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.108
(BELL RINGS)

11:48.141 --> 11:49.375
Oh, the bell.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.877
Let's not be late
for class.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.413
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, right!

11:53.446 --> 11:54.815
Hey, Lindsay,

11:56.449 --> 11:57.984
I... You know,
I think it's...

11:58.018 --> 12:01.087
I think it's nice
that you're helping
your mom hand out candy.

12:02.288 --> 12:04.157
So, I'll see you later.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.191
Yeah.

12:05.792 --> 12:06.993
See you later.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.735
SAM: This is gonna take like
a trillion years to read.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.670
I don't even know
what it's about.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.939
Whitman said it's about
an ax murderer.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.240
BILL: That sounds
kinda cool.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.242
I guarantee you
it's not gonna be cool.

12:22.275 --> 12:25.812
I mean... Look how small
the printing is.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.614
Uh, perhaps
you've never heard

12:27.648 --> 12:29.916
of a little thing called
Cliff Notes?

12:29.950 --> 12:31.985
You still have to
read them.

12:32.018 --> 12:34.855
Whitman is such a jerk!
You know?

12:34.888 --> 12:36.422
She says you have to be
young adults.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.259
We're not adults.
We're kids until
we turn 18.

12:40.561 --> 12:42.696
Maybe you are.
But when I hit 13,

12:42.729 --> 12:44.330
I became a man.

12:44.364 --> 12:47.568
That's only in
your temple, Neal,
not in the real world.

12:47.601 --> 12:51.437
Hey! We should go trick
or treating tomorrow night.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.274
In case you
haven't noticed,
we're a little old.

12:54.307 --> 12:57.043
No, we're not, okay?
We went trick or treating
last year.

12:57.343 --> 12:58.512
Come on.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.313
Let's go out
tomorrow night.

13:00.346 --> 13:03.316
No way. I'm going to
the J. C.'s haunted house.

13:03.349 --> 13:05.085
The Hot dog on a Stick
girls from the mall

13:05.118 --> 13:07.220
are workin' in it.
The tall ones?

13:07.253 --> 13:09.222
Yeah. Judy.

13:09.255 --> 13:10.290
They're hot.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.592
Judy, tootie, tootie!

13:11.625 --> 13:12.959
All right, then
why don't we

13:12.993 --> 13:14.661
go trick or treating
before that?

13:14.695 --> 13:16.563
Why don't we just
go buy candy?

13:16.597 --> 13:18.498
Oh, yeah, that's
really fun.

13:18.532 --> 13:21.401
Come on!
It'll be a blast.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.636
It's better than sitting home

13:22.669 --> 13:24.971
reading some
stupid Russian book.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.273
Sure.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.875
Okay, you know, I...

13:28.909 --> 13:30.376
Yeah, I guess... I could...
You know, we...

13:30.410 --> 13:31.712
I... Yeah, I guess so.

13:31.745 --> 13:33.179
I don't know.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.982
You're never gonna
dress up as Groucho again?

13:38.151 --> 13:39.853
Well... (AS GROUCHO)
That's the most
ridiculous thing

13:39.886 --> 13:41.087
I've ever hoird!

13:42.255 --> 13:43.256
Groucho sucks.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.536
Tommy!

13:55.569 --> 13:56.570
Honey!

14:04.110 --> 14:05.178
Lindsay!

14:12.519 --> 14:13.520
Hey, Lindsay.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.622
What's up?

14:15.656 --> 14:17.490
Millie,
who is that?

14:20.661 --> 14:21.695
Who?

14:21.728 --> 14:23.163
Millie!

14:26.166 --> 14:28.301
You weren't
supposed to see.

14:28.334 --> 14:30.937
That's Tommy,
my secret love.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.106
We met this summer
at church camp.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.942
You have a boyfriend?

14:35.976 --> 14:38.078
Lindsay, you've gotta
keep this a secret.

14:38.111 --> 14:41.715
I mean, Tommy
and I don't even
French kiss yet.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.249
Tommy says
that if you do

14:43.283 --> 14:46.286
before you've been
going out for six months,
you go to hell.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.022
Why didn't you
tell me?

14:49.055 --> 14:51.224
I didn't want to
make you feel bad...

14:51.257 --> 14:53.259
Since you don't
have a boyfriend
and all.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.067
NICK: Come on.
No way!

15:01.101 --> 15:02.503
DANIEL:
I'm telling you, man.
It's true.

15:02.536 --> 15:05.171
When I heard him play
at Cobo Hall,
guy was amazing.

15:05.205 --> 15:09.142
Whoa, hold on a second.
So they're called
Santana, right?

15:09.175 --> 15:12.278
But that guy who's singing...
Is not Santana.

15:12.312 --> 15:15.716
No. Santana's
the guitar player.

15:15.749 --> 15:19.019
Then how did he
get them to name
the band after him?

15:19.052 --> 15:21.021
I don't know, man.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.689
Maybe he's just
a bad ass.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.292
If that's true,
that's amazing.

15:26.326 --> 15:29.262
Hey, maybe we should
name our band Zarios.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.164
Hey!

15:31.197 --> 15:33.399
I'm going out with
you guys tomorrow night.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.568
NICK: Hey!

15:34.601 --> 15:35.769
Hey, that's great!

15:35.802 --> 15:37.638
Yeah, but what
about your mom?

15:37.671 --> 15:40.340
How's she gonna
hand out candy
all by herself?

15:42.408 --> 15:44.545
Well, she'll survive.

15:44.578 --> 15:46.179

16:01.695 --> 16:03.564
Neal, Bill, and I decided
to go trick or treating
tomorrow night.

16:03.597 --> 16:06.266
Oh, Sam, that's great!
We have to get you a costume.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.969
No, Mom. I'm gonna
make my own.
I'm goin' out as Gort.

16:09.002 --> 16:11.171
He's the robot from
The Day the Earth Stood Still.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.974
Ooh! Gort!
How exciting!

16:14.007 --> 16:17.010
Sam, what are you doing?
You're too old to go out
trick or treating.

16:17.043 --> 16:19.680
Oh, Harold, stop.

16:19.713 --> 16:22.115
Well, it's true!

16:22.148 --> 16:24.751
There was this kid
in my neighborhood
when I was growing up...

16:25.385 --> 16:26.587
Scott Byron.

16:26.620 --> 16:30.657
He kept on trick
or treating until he was
well into his 20s.

16:30.691 --> 16:32.358
You know where
he's living now?

16:32.392 --> 16:35.796
At home.
With his 90‐year‐old mother!

16:35.829 --> 16:37.998
He's the laughing stock
of the community.

16:38.699 --> 16:40.366
Never took a wife, either.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.902
I don't think
there's anything wrong

16:41.935 --> 16:44.805
with acting like a kid
every once in a while.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.372
I know Lindsay and I

16:46.406 --> 16:48.942
are gonna have a great

come by your place.

17:04.525 --> 17:06.326
And bring pillow cases.
No grocery bags.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.961
If your bag rips,
you're on your own.

17:07.994 --> 17:09.630
I'm gonna bring
my plastic pumpkin.

17:09.663 --> 17:12.398
Don't bring that.
It gets full
after one street.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.234
Not if I eat the candy
as we go.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.502
Last time
you did that,

17:15.536 --> 17:17.571
you puked before
we got past our bus stop.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.240
Hey, guys. I heard
you were going out for
trick or treats tonight.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.808
How did you
find out about that?

17:21.842 --> 17:23.510
Word gets out.
People talk.

17:23.544 --> 17:25.278
But you gotta be
especially careful,
though.

17:25.311 --> 17:27.380
The Halloween candy's
gonna be really
dangerous this year.

17:27.413 --> 17:29.349
They say that
every year.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.051
Yeah, but this year
there's a bunch of
evil hippies

17:31.084 --> 17:34.054
who don't want Reagan
to be president, so to
disrupt the election,

17:34.087 --> 17:36.690
they're going to inject
the candy with heroin
and turn kids into addicts.

17:36.723 --> 17:40.026
That's not true.
You just have to watch out
for pins and razor blades.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.529
Yeah, and rat hair's
a big one.

17:42.563 --> 17:44.798
You're gonna
find yourself wishing
for rat hair.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.200
Word on the street
is they're putting
a poo in fun‐sized

17:47.233 --> 17:48.902
candy bar wrappers
and handing those out.

17:48.935 --> 17:51.572
I love fun‐sized
candy bars.

17:51.605 --> 17:52.739
Oh, that's stupid.

17:52.773 --> 17:55.141
Like nobody'd
be able to tell
what it really was.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.543
They dip it in
chocolate first

17:56.577 --> 17:58.144
so you can't
tell the difference
until it's too late.

18:00.046 --> 18:01.247
See ya.

18:04.751 --> 18:05.986
Actually, it sounds kinda fun.

18:06.019 --> 18:07.453
You mind if I come
with you guys?

18:10.857 --> 18:12.025

18:21.067 --> 18:23.737
Hey, Lindsay,
where have you been?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.606
You're gonna miss
the first trick or treaters.

18:25.639 --> 18:28.241
You know
the cutest ones
always come early.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.443

I was hanging out
with my friends.

18:31.645 --> 18:32.713
Lo...ah! Ow.

18:32.746 --> 18:34.781

we're gonna hand
out this year.

18:34.815 --> 18:37.317
Halloween cookies!

18:38.018 --> 18:39.119
That's great, Mom.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.486
SAM: What's up with
all the cookies?

18:40.521 --> 18:43.256
Sam, I laid your
robot costume out
on your bed.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.691
You didn't rip it,
did you?

18:44.725 --> 18:47.628
No. But I wrote,
"My son's the cutest boy
in the whole world"

18:47.661 --> 18:49.329
on the front of it.

18:49.362 --> 18:52.132
Lindsay, I got you a costume.
Go put it on, sweetie.

18:52.165 --> 18:55.268
I'm gonna put these
cookies by the door.

18:55.301 --> 18:58.905
We are gonna have
so much fun!

19:04.077 --> 19:06.580
Kinda hate when Mom
gets goofy like that.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.815
what would I wear?

I'm sorry,
I can't hear you.

32:50.637 --> 32:51.672
All right.
There it is.

32:51.705 --> 32:52.739
Go for it, Weir.

32:52.773 --> 32:54.474
Do it already.

Thanks a lot.

I can't believe this.

33:21.668 --> 33:24.437
I can't believe
the Hot Dog on a Stick
girls saw us.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.472
That's months
of groundwork
down the drain.

33:26.507 --> 33:28.108

go out with you.

33:28.141 --> 33:29.375

Oh, no, no,
no, no.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.223
Oh, my God.

33:43.256 --> 33:45.692
Hey, Alan.
What's up?

33:45.726 --> 33:48.161
I don't know whose ass
I want to kick first.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.663
You better
watch out, Alan.

33:49.696 --> 33:50.831
We kicked your ass once.

33:50.864 --> 33:52.232
We'll kick it again.

33:52.265 --> 33:55.101
I don't think so.
That was three
against one.

33:55.135 --> 33:57.103
Now we got us
a fair fight.

33:57.137 --> 33:59.139
It's time
to settle the score.

34:00.006 --> 34:03.009

I got it. I got it.

Let's go soap
the school's windows.

34:05.912 --> 34:10.517
No, look. I say
it's time we get down
to some serious damage.

We don't want
to fight you, Alan.

34:19.660 --> 34:21.361
ALAN: You don't have to.

34:21.394 --> 34:23.597
Just give us your candy
and you're free to go.

Okay, here.

34:29.803 --> 34:30.837
Forget it.

34:30.871 --> 34:32.305
We went through
a lot for this.

34:32.338 --> 34:34.007
Shut your mouth,
you little girl.

34:34.040 --> 34:36.543
I'm not a little girl.
I'm a Bionic Woman.

Yeah? Prove it.

cut it out. Stop.

out of here.

34:58.899 --> 35:01.301
NEAL: That's it.
That is it.

35:01.868 --> 35:04.204
This is all your fault.

35:04.237 --> 35:07.040
I never should have
let you talk me into this.

35:07.073 --> 35:09.610
I didn't talk you
into anything.

35:09.643 --> 35:12.345
Oh, well, it sure
as hell wasn't my idea.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.049
Oh, yeah.

stick to the plan.

to throw it?

Dig in, children.
Awesome.

All right, jackpot.
Jackpot. Come on.

35:34.334 --> 35:35.936
KIM: Ready? Over there!
Where?

35:35.969 --> 35:38.204
You're such a baby.
Have to have your
little baby's evening.

35:38.238 --> 35:41.642
Yeah, going to some stupid
haunted house is much better.
Yeah, you're stupid.

35:41.675 --> 35:43.844

Well, you are one.

Come on.

I can't see.

blocking my view.

What?

36:02.896 --> 36:04.565
Oh, my God.
What?

36:04.598 --> 36:06.800
We just egged
my little brother.

36:12.038 --> 36:13.439
Oh, my God.

36:14.808 --> 36:16.543
Wait, stop the car.

36:16.577 --> 36:18.044
It's just eggs.
He'll be fine.

36:18.078 --> 36:20.113
No, stop the car.
Please, Daniel.

Take it easy.

36:23.016 --> 36:24.350
Let me
out of the car!

36:24.384 --> 36:25.852
Hey, Daniel, stop
the car, all right?

36:25.886 --> 36:27.187
Just stop the car.
Let her out.

to finish us off.

their back yard!

Please? Come on.

your sister's fault.

know it was you.

Look, she's really,
really upset, kid.

shut up, please?

so much trouble.

terrible people

this to you, Sam?

Freaks? Like
circus freaks?

there's bearded ladies

throwing eggs at kids.

I'd be back
in a little bit.

you went off with?

from school.
