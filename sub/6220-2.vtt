and I checked they were okay,
they were.

you could do that.

who killed your brother?
-What?

for it twice just so he could
push him back down again?

he'd told his mates
to video on James' phone?

it was a bad idea.

It wasn't an argument.
It was just for laughs.

he might gotten himself out,
but...

or...

There are words James
never got to say,
but I can't.

37:30.458 --> 37:33.211

it was something to do,

37:33.294 --> 37:36.631

could've changed his mind
any time but he didn't.
