10:16.260 --> 10:19.980
♪ Be good to me ♪

10:22.130 --> 10:26.140
♪ Be good to me. ♪

10:29.140 --> 10:32.520
Do we really need to be
spending all of this money

10:32.540 --> 10:34.480
sponsoring Orange Night?

10:34.540 --> 10:37.680
Look, this is an introduction
to Atlanta high society for us

10:37.700 --> 10:39.500
and our company. Hmm?

10:39.520 --> 10:41.430
Hey, can I talk to you
guys for a minute?

10:41.450 --> 10:42.720
Yes.

10:42.790 --> 10:44.300
Anything for Carlotta.

10:44.340 --> 10:46.660
You want to discuss why
everyone is talking about

10:46.690 --> 10:50.590
how the head of Gravity Records
lost it at a nightclub?

10:50.660 --> 10:54.560
I'll get them talking
about something else:

10:54.630 --> 10:56.730
a music and multimedia festival,

10:56.740 --> 11:01.070
concerts, film screenings,
exclusive parties.

11:01.140 --> 11:02.870
I'm calling it Rhythm & Bells.

11:02.940 --> 11:05.540
It's something I've been working
on ever since we lost the tour.

11:05.660 --> 11:08.130
All I need is the perfect host.

11:08.160 --> 11:11.100
Now, we already have Ryan
French hosting Orange Night.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.400
His popularity and credibility

11:13.460 --> 11:16.620
bring numbers and gravitas to any event.

11:16.690 --> 11:19.190
He'd be the perfect person
for Rhythm & Bells.

11:19.260 --> 11:21.420
Well, I hope so,

11:21.490 --> 11:24.320
because your six-month
window is closing very fast.

11:24.390 --> 11:27.800
Rhythm & Bells Fest is money
in the bank. Trust me.

11:27.860 --> 11:31.030
For your job's sake, you
better get it done.

11:35.940 --> 11:39.540
Simone, wait up. You've
been avoiding my calls.

11:39.610 --> 11:41.880
Yeah, well, I saw that you
and Mateo were kissing,

11:41.940 --> 11:43.020
so I guess you've just accepted

11:43.030 --> 11:45.850
whatever he had to say
about that reporter.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.650
I just think you deserve better.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.600
We are in an open relationship,

11:50.620 --> 11:53.190
but we do have rules, and he broke them.

11:53.260 --> 11:55.420
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to judge.

11:55.490 --> 11:57.440
It's been a long time
since I had a friend

11:57.470 --> 11:59.630
look out for me like that.

11:59.700 --> 12:02.300
I was actually calling
about Orange Night.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.850
Mateo, he gave a ton of
money to have us honored

12:04.880 --> 12:06.300
in front of Atlanta's elite crowd,

12:06.340 --> 12:08.140
and I want you to introduce us.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.900
- Me? Why?
- Mm-hmm.

12:09.940 --> 12:12.250
For the exposure. I mean, you're
the star of our first feature.

12:12.270 --> 12:15.340
Yeah, but... I-I don't do well speaking

12:15.410 --> 12:17.040
in front of people. I-I can't do this.

12:17.110 --> 12:19.760
Just be that same badass that you were

12:19.780 --> 12:20.856
when you walked into that room

12:20.880 --> 12:22.520
and pitched yourself for the movie.

12:22.590 --> 12:24.720
I know you can do it.

12:26.890 --> 12:28.720
On my way.

12:28.790 --> 12:32.730
Ryan French, Carlotta Brown.
Gravity Records.

12:32.810 --> 12:34.410
Oh, see my producer for bookings.

12:34.480 --> 12:37.280
Uh, listen, actually I want to book you

12:37.350 --> 12:40.320
to be the official host of
Gravity Media's winter festival.

12:40.390 --> 12:43.240
Gravity Media? Owned by
Mateo and Nina Ferrera?

12:43.340 --> 12:45.060
Yeah, I'll pass.

12:45.940 --> 12:48.630
Can I ask why?

12:48.660 --> 12:51.260
They slapped their logo
all over my event,

12:51.320 --> 12:52.800
booked a performance for Take 3,

12:52.870 --> 12:55.230
and then invited all
these industry folks.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.420
Orange Night is about keeping
our children from dying.

12:58.540 --> 13:00.870
Mateo likes to do things big.

13:00.940 --> 13:03.410
Well, it's shameless self-promotion.

13:03.480 --> 13:06.610
I create platforms to
impact people's lives.

13:06.650 --> 13:09.260
And that's what Rhythm & Bells is.

13:09.300 --> 13:13.130
Actually, Mateo changed the
performance to Alex Crane.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.940
It's all about rising from the ashes.

13:16.060 --> 13:17.659
Alex Crane?

13:17.660 --> 13:20.320
Well, that's more appealing to me.

13:20.390 --> 13:22.860
Listen, why don't you let me
introduce you to him tonight?

13:22.930 --> 13:24.060
We'll see how it goes.

13:24.130 --> 13:26.260
- Thank you.
- Deal.

13:31.900 --> 13:34.900
I mean, y'all, I'm telling
you, this speech is long.

13:35.010 --> 13:37.340
I mean, what's the big deal?
You sing onstage all the time.

13:37.410 --> 13:38.610
This is different.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.680
How? You don't even got to stay on key.

13:40.710 --> 13:43.180
Oh, she don't do that no way.

13:43.380 --> 13:45.650
Don't even listen to her.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.700
Carlotta, you get a
chance to talk to legal yet

13:47.720 --> 13:48.939
about Maurice? He's taking money

13:48.940 --> 13:49.959
out my pocket and I'm not...

13:49.960 --> 13:52.080
Star, you gonna have to
handle this yourself.

13:53.460 --> 13:54.760
Okay.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.800
Okay, look. We got a change of plan.

13:59.870 --> 14:02.030
Alex will be performing
solo at Orange Night.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.030
- Wait, why just Alex?
- I'm trying to land

14:04.100 --> 14:05.770
Ryan French to host the winter festival.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.540
The only way he'll sign on is if

14:07.610 --> 14:11.310
he believes that Gravity Media
has a strong social impact.

14:11.340 --> 14:12.910
Alex has the strongest message.

14:12.980 --> 14:15.010
The rich girl is gonna
sing about gun violence?

14:15.080 --> 14:16.510
Yeah, says ghetto Barbie.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.420
Look, Alex, I
know you've been writing

14:18.440 --> 14:20.640
and you've been journaling
about your experience.

14:20.750 --> 14:23.196
Maybe it's finally time you show
us what you've been working on.

14:23.220 --> 14:24.730
It's not ready.

14:24.780 --> 14:26.610
- I'm not ready.
- I stay ready.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.610
This is not up for debate.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.200
Alex, you need to finish the song.

14:30.270 --> 14:33.670
Star, you're benched this
go-round. Are we clear?

14:33.740 --> 14:34.940
- Yep.
- Yeah.

14:35.010 --> 14:37.610
I'll go get my money, like I always do.

14:37.680 --> 14:42.150
And I got a song to
write, like I always do.

14:42.210 --> 14:43.596
I know it's long, just...

14:43.620 --> 14:46.050
All right.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.990
You all right, C?

14:49.050 --> 14:51.490
You need a little girl
talk to take the edge off?

14:51.560 --> 14:54.860
I'm fine, Bruce. Just close
the door on your way out.

14:54.930 --> 14:57.680
All right, boss lady.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.970
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.880
Maurice send you here to talk to me?

15:09.040 --> 15:13.340
No, I just left some
things in the studio.

15:13.410 --> 15:15.210
He's strong-arming me, too.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.100
Then walk away.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.260
I'm serious, Noah.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.356
You just signed that contract.
Find a way to un-sign it.

15:20.380 --> 15:23.740
That's easier said than done.
What you gonna do?

15:24.300 --> 15:26.630
I mean, you know me.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.180
I'm-a hit him where it hurts.

15:28.250 --> 15:32.280
I just got to find out what he
cares about other than himself.

15:32.350 --> 15:34.680
- Which is a difficult task.
- Uh-huh.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.290
Yeah. I'll see you later.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.520
Be careful.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.160
You always wanted to be your own boss.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.000
Congrats.

15:49.070 --> 15:51.330
I said I wanted a lot of things.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.700
Some of it came true, some of it didn't.

15:53.770 --> 15:56.880
Yeah, and I want to make that up to you.

15:57.020 --> 15:59.580
I know I messed up when I got injured.

15:59.740 --> 16:02.250
Football has been all
I have for so long,

16:02.310 --> 16:04.250
and then it was gone and...

16:04.260 --> 16:06.420
And you tried to replace
it with other women.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.420
I'm sorry.

16:10.820 --> 16:13.740
The only reason why I'm a champion

16:13.780 --> 16:15.780
is because I never gave up on the game

16:15.820 --> 16:19.030
until I played every
last play in the book.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.460
That hasn't changed.

16:20.530 --> 16:22.770
I need your respect back.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.640
Maybe that could start with dinner.

16:25.700 --> 16:29.040
I am not ready for that yet.

16:30.660 --> 16:33.310
Well, I'm here when you are.

16:38.180 --> 16:40.000
I understand,
but I need all the press

16:40.020 --> 16:41.920
around Orange Night to focus on

16:41.990 --> 16:44.740
Gravity Records' social justice impact.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.920
L-Let me call you back.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.540
What the hell they doing
with Jahil's trailer?

16:54.940 --> 16:57.379
Excuse me. This is private property.

16:57.380 --> 16:59.370
What are you... What-what
the hell are you doing?

16:59.380 --> 17:00.970
I told them to take it, Mama.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.356
Hanging on to the past ain't
getting either of us anywhere.

17:03.380 --> 17:06.380
You had no right to do
that without asking me.

17:07.270 --> 17:08.599
Don't you touch that RV.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.060
I'm just here to do my job, ma'am.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.700
If you put your hands on that
RV, I will rip you to pieces.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.920
I promise you that. Now get
the hell off my property!

17:17.210 --> 17:18.670
Mama.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.620
Look, Olivia, I don't
think we can really work

17:29.640 --> 17:32.480
- on your music today, I'm sorry.
- Uh, are you kidding?

17:32.500 --> 17:34.400
I'm getting an up close
and personal look

17:34.410 --> 17:37.040
at how Alex Crane writes a song.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.670
This is everything.

17:38.710 --> 17:41.040
Hey, D.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.980
- What's up?
- Hey.

17:44.050 --> 17:46.610
I was, uh, trying to see if you
want to grab something to eat.

17:46.680 --> 17:47.680
Oh, she can't.

17:47.690 --> 17:49.699
Carlotta gave her a
solo at Orange Night.

17:49.700 --> 17:51.000
We have to write.

17:52.820 --> 17:55.020
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

17:55.090 --> 17:58.090
Aw, y'all cute or whatever.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.399
Can you give me

17:59.400 --> 18:00.620
a minute with my girl, please?

18:00.730 --> 18:03.740
Yeah, sorry. I'm being intense.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.830
It's okay.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.640
You don't even seem like you into it.

18:12.860 --> 18:14.460
I mean, I'm writing

18:14.530 --> 18:16.960
a song about the crash.

18:17.030 --> 18:20.100
And the pain and guilt from
it, so, yeah, it's weird.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.680
And I don't know if I'm
ready for everybody

18:21.700 --> 18:22.970
to see that side of me, so...

18:23.030 --> 18:25.700
If anybody can do it, you can do it.

18:25.770 --> 18:29.040
It'll also really help if
you and Olivia are there.

18:29.110 --> 18:30.940
Don't you think you're doing

18:31.010 --> 18:33.110
a little much with this Olivia girl?

18:33.180 --> 18:36.260
- Why are you so worried?
- 'Cause I can be.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.050
Just be careful, okay?

18:39.120 --> 18:40.680
I got to go, but...

18:40.750 --> 18:43.850
- I'll be there to cheer you on.
- Okay.

19:01.770 --> 19:04.410
Uh, I'm sorry.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.420
Your... your assistant
said I could come in.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.610
I'm sure she did.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.850
Um, to what do I owe this surprise?

19:12.920 --> 19:16.440
Um, I was looking for
some professional advice.

19:16.570 --> 19:18.340
And you think I can help?

19:18.410 --> 19:20.210
Definitely.

19:20.270 --> 19:22.410
Um, I was hoping you could take a look

19:22.480 --> 19:25.040
- at my contract with Karma.
- Maurice's club.

19:25.140 --> 19:26.999
I need somebody who knows him.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.620
Like, knows his weaknesses.

19:28.680 --> 19:32.080
Because I feel like I'm getting
the short end of the deal.

19:32.190 --> 19:33.820
Is that gonna be a problem?

19:35.810 --> 19:38.056
Star, you know I can't have you
wilding out like that anymore

19:38.080 --> 19:39.420
now that you're pregnant.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.699
First of all, I'm-a do whatever I want.

19:41.700 --> 19:42.939
And just 'cause I'm pregnant

19:42.940 --> 19:44.740
doesn't mean I'm about
to go soft on people.

19:44.750 --> 19:47.400
And last time I checked, you
don't make enough money

19:47.420 --> 19:48.720
to take care of a baby.

19:48.790 --> 19:50.860
So I kind of got to do what I got to do.

19:52.020 --> 19:53.860
Okay.

19:53.940 --> 19:55.940
Well, whatever you're doing, I'm in.

19:56.010 --> 19:57.900
This is our baby.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.480
All right.

20:00.550 --> 20:03.280
I got to find a way to
get back into Karma.

I'm not in the mood.

20:26.780 --> 20:28.870
Look, this is too much damn money.

20:28.940 --> 20:30.780
I'm-a look suspect trying
to clean all of this cash

20:30.790 --> 20:33.750
when you know I'm trying to go legit.

20:34.110 --> 20:35.410
Relax, babe.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.150
I mean, can't I just pay you back

20:37.220 --> 20:39.060
for the loan you gave
me to start the club?

20:39.100 --> 20:42.150
I mean, I can make that happen.
I just need a second.

20:42.190 --> 20:44.490
Well, now, you wouldn't have to do that

20:44.560 --> 20:47.130

20:47.160 --> 20:49.390

Now, why are you trying to be
somebody you're not, Cass?

20:58.210 --> 21:00.810
You're a thug.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.280
A cold-blooded killer.

21:06.010 --> 21:07.620
But you are...

21:09.140 --> 21:10.880
... who you are.

21:10.950 --> 21:13.450
- And that's never gonna change.
- Don't tell me who I am.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.800
I'm not cleaning your money.

21:15.820 --> 21:18.490

23:45.030 --> 23:48.130
Just never imagined he

23:48.200 --> 23:51.700
I pray to God and ask why, and...

You ever thought about
going to get some help?

24:15.340 --> 24:17.340
Look, I told you, I prayed about it.

24:17.380 --> 24:19.940
Okay? I'm good.

24:20.010 --> 24:23.650
At least I'm-I'm getting there.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.650
All right.

24:25.680 --> 24:29.000
But right now we got to
get you to this benefit.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.390
Get out of here and go
murder them hos tonight.

24:31.460 --> 24:33.520
You know it's a gun
violence fundraiser, right?

24:33.560 --> 24:35.570
Uh, well, I mean, I don't mean
murder, you know. I mean, like,

24:35.590 --> 24:37.039
go slay them hos.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.859
Slay 'em? You can't even find the word.

Lady Hulk is not

- Okay.

24:58.020 --> 25:01.000
- I told you I'm not drunk.
- All right, you're not. Okay.

25:01.050 --> 25:03.220
- I'm not.
- All right. All right.

25:03.260 --> 25:04.440

There ain't no such thing as
one kill before I go legit,

because if I were to do that,

25:39.080 --> 25:40.489

25:56.780 --> 25:58.340
I'm gonna introduce you to him now.

25:58.380 --> 26:01.110
Now, you start the conversation
about Rhythm & Bells.

26:01.180 --> 26:03.980
Ryan. Mateo Ferrera.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.450
Mateo, Ryan.

26:06.520 --> 26:09.090
Hi, Ryan. Pleasure to meet you, man.

26:09.150 --> 26:10.536
This cause is very close to our hearts.

26:10.560 --> 26:13.060
Is it? Or does it fix your PR nightmare?

26:13.120 --> 26:16.330
What, Joyce Sheree pulls
a gun on Star Davis

26:16.390 --> 26:18.930

money at Orange Night.

26:24.940 --> 26:27.400
I'll try to smooth Ryan out
after the performance.

26:27.470 --> 26:29.299
He's a big fan of Alex's,

26:29.300 --> 26:33.260
so hopefully her song can speak to him.

26:35.050 --> 26:37.410
Thank you.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.920
Hey, you know anything
about Bankhead Crew?

26:39.990 --> 26:41.050
I don't.

26:41.120 --> 26:43.590
All right.

26:49.260 --> 26:52.360
- Why do I got to be the lookout?
- 'Cause I know how to snoop.

26:52.430 --> 26:53.939
And I know what I'm looking for.

26:53.940 --> 26:55.740
Years in foster care.

26:55.930 --> 26:58.600
Plus, my daddy was a con, so
I guess it's in my blood.

26:58.670 --> 27:00.100
Please don't teach our kid that.

27:00.170 --> 27:03.070
I'm-a teach her whatever she
needs to know to survive.

27:03.140 --> 27:05.840
Listen, I know you feel like
you can't count on anybody

27:05.910 --> 27:09.550
since Brody's gone and now Maurice...

27:09.610 --> 27:13.650
but just... just know that I got you.

27:14.790 --> 27:16.450

27:16.520 --> 27:18.900
was the time for this conversation?

27:25.460 --> 27:27.300
Damn.

27:30.040 --> 27:33.900
I keep forgetting this
fool won the Super Bowl.

27:33.970 --> 27:35.470
Gotcha, bitch.

27:43.480 --> 27:45.980
Keep Bankhead out your mouth, bruh.

27:46.680 --> 27:48.650
- What's up?
- Come on, bruh.

27:51.190 --> 27:53.740
What's good?

27:59.430 --> 28:00.720
Hey.

28:00.900 --> 28:04.100
Hey, uh, have you seen Derek yet?

28:04.170 --> 28:06.959
I haven't seen him, but
I got you all day.

28:06.960 --> 28:09.500
And I don't want you to think
I'm coming on too strong

28:09.520 --> 28:11.440
or intense, like he thinks.

28:11.510 --> 28:13.480
Why would you say that?

28:13.550 --> 28:17.180
I just feel like Derek doesn't
get why we're so close.

28:17.250 --> 28:19.620
And, you know, I get it.

28:19.680 --> 28:22.390
He wants you all to himself.

28:22.450 --> 28:24.590
Here.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.460
Oh. There you are.

28:32.530 --> 28:34.760
Listen, Mateo had me
rewrite the intro so as to

28:34.830 --> 28:37.200
- not offend Ryan French.
- No. No.

28:37.270 --> 28:38.940
- What?
- I have this one memorized.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.650
Breathe, Simone.

28:40.660 --> 28:42.160
It's okay, we don't have
time to print it out,

28:42.180 --> 28:43.680
but the teleprompter's gonna guide you.

28:43.700 --> 28:45.220
I can't read that.

28:46.190 --> 28:47.830
I'm gonna be sick.

28:58.120 --> 28:59.590
Welcome.

28:59.710 --> 29:01.640
Thank you for your
support and attendance

29:01.710 --> 29:03.880
for the gun control issue in our state.

29:03.950 --> 29:07.600
You are twice as likely to
get shot to death in Georgia

29:07.620 --> 29:08.760
than in New York.

29:08.820 --> 29:13.190
With a rate of 4.9 deaths
per 100,000 residents,

29:13.220 --> 29:15.720
we must act now.

29:15.790 --> 29:17.120
Yes.

29:20.320 --> 29:24.560
Please... allow a moment of silence

29:24.630 --> 29:27.680

32:41.530 --> 32:44.270
me and Bianca, we used
to do that sometimes.

33:12.830 --> 33:15.330

34:01.050 --> 34:04.950
I couldn't understand what
the teacher was saying.

34:05.020 --> 34:07.820
It's okay. I get it.

34:07.890 --> 34:10.920
Look, I'm not illiterate
or anything like that.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.719
I'm just not good at it.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.860
And the teachers would just pass me on

34:14.929 --> 34:16.690
to be the next person's problem.

34:16.730 --> 34:18.730
- Well, let me help you.
- No.

34:18.800 --> 34:21.830
Don't tell anyone. And don't tell Mateo.

34:21.900 --> 34:24.300
Or else he'll replace me
in the movie, and I've...

34:24.370 --> 34:26.000
That's all I got after Take 3.

34:26.070 --> 34:29.110
- But, Simone, I...
- I got to keep your secret.

34:29.179 --> 34:31.239
You can keep mine, too.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.580
How much you think we could get for it?

34:36.650 --> 34:37.920
Was he a good player?

34:37.980 --> 34:39.880
Probably, like, 50 grand.

34:39.949 --> 34:41.489
And after you pay me,

34:41.550 --> 34:43.620
you'll have a little left
for some studio time.

34:43.690 --> 34:46.420
You are so bold. You know that?

34:46.489 --> 34:48.860
You finagled your way into
this entire situation.

34:48.929 --> 34:51.260
And you used my lips to get in the door.

34:51.330 --> 34:53.159
I feel violated.

34:53.230 --> 34:54.929
Uh-huh.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.500
Come on, you know we had fun on tour.

34:57.540 --> 34:59.140
And it wasn't just hooking up.

34:59.210 --> 35:01.240
Okay. Tell that to the broken condom.

35:01.320 --> 35:02.779
Aw, isn't this cute?

35:02.780 --> 35:04.420
I know you jacked my ring, Star.

35:04.510 --> 35:06.620
Unless you brought your
lawyer here to give me back

35:06.660 --> 35:09.200
- my song rights, get out my yard.
- Jackson, talk some sense

35:09.230 --> 35:11.600
into your girl. I don't want
to call the cops, but I will.

35:11.670 --> 35:13.730
- Call the cops, Maurice.
- Okay, listen,

35:13.800 --> 35:15.800
I'm not telling her anything,
'cause she's right.

35:15.840 --> 35:18.410
But we're gonna squash this here.

35:18.470 --> 35:19.640
No need for cops.

35:20.940 --> 35:24.010
Yeah, good luck with
all that crazy, homey.

35:27.530 --> 35:31.070
Don't ever, ever take
nothing out my hands again.

35:31.190 --> 35:33.190
You needed to stay in your lane.

35:33.310 --> 35:35.740
Star, he probably has
cameras all over his club.

35:35.810 --> 35:38.540
And, what, the mother of
my kid's gonna go to jail?

35:38.610 --> 35:39.880
Over something so stupid?

35:39.950 --> 35:42.310
- We'll find another way.
- We won't do nothing.

35:42.350 --> 35:45.250
It's no "we," Jackson.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.590
- Don't do this.
- Good night.

35:47.620 --> 35:50.100
Star.

35:59.070 --> 36:00.430
Yo!

36:00.500 --> 36:04.030
Hey, bitch. Where you think you going?

36:11.840 --> 36:14.100
Damn.

36:17.150 --> 36:19.420
No, no.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.320

36:40.380 --> 36:42.320
Oh, my God.

36:42.390 --> 36:44.020
Oh! Oh! Oh, my God.

36:44.060 --> 36:45.720

36:45.790 --> 36:48.000
Wh-What?

36:48.060 --> 36:49.790
What's the matter?

36:49.860 --> 36:51.960
- What...
- I did what you told me to do.

36:52.030 --> 36:53.360
But I think Cassie...

36:53.400 --> 36:56.180
It's-it's okay. I got you now.
Just-just hold on.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.600
I'm not gonna let nothing
happen to you, okay?

36:57.610 --> 36:59.039
- I'm gonna be all right?
- Yeah, you gonna be all right.

36:59.040 --> 37:01.440
I got you. I'm-I'm not gonna
let you die, all right?

37:01.460 --> 37:03.360

37:44.180 --> 37:46.450

37:46.520 --> 37:49.990
Andy was into it with some bad people.

37:50.050 --> 37:53.200
And he didn't say anything
until he was already drowning.

37:54.360 --> 37:56.699
I failed him.

37:56.700 --> 37:58.460
No, you didn't, Miss C.

37:58.530 --> 38:00.360

get ready for this big

38:19.880 --> 38:21.570
