Todd!

00:49.299 --> 00:51.134
Here you go, trophy for your great job

00:51.217 --> 00:53.803
graduating first grade,
huge milestone, whatever.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.599
Ah, graduation.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.517
And does this mean she's moving out

00:59.601 --> 01:01.478
and I can have my life back?

01:01.561 --> 01:02.687
Moving out?

01:02.771 --> 01:06.191
Who do you think is paying our mortgage
with all the pageant winnings?

01:06.274 --> 01:08.276
It sure ain't your disability checks.

01:08.359 --> 01:11.237
Hey, not my fault my spine grew back.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.363
Tord!

01:12.447 --> 01:13.823
Adequate job, Tord.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.742
Tracy the Boy.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.702
Tracy the Girl.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.121
And last but not least,

01:20.205 --> 01:21.372
U-Utter.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.540
U

01:22.624 --> 01:24.667
Eh, trophy me, Clover.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.377
We, uh...

01:26.461 --> 01:29.380
...seem to be out of trophies,
Your Majesty.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.758
What

01:31.841 --> 01:33.760
This is Utta's big day.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.720
Oh, uh, I don't need a trophy.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.598
I-I'm just proud of my hard work.

01:38.681 --> 01:40.517
Everyone needs a trophy, Utta.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.935
-My peoples!

01:42.018 --> 01:43.394
Little change of plans.

01:43.478 --> 01:46.105
Your king needs to run a quick errand,

01:46.189 --> 01:47.315
but I'll be right back.

01:47.398 --> 01:49.984
Uh, Pancho and Ted will entertain you
while I'm gone.

01:50.068 --> 01:50.902
Won't you, guys?

01:50.985 --> 01:51.986
My time to shine.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.489
Just need to warm up
my throat muscles real quick.

01:58.243 --> 02:01.037
Andy, we got a trophy emergency!

02:03.206 --> 02:04.457
Be right back!

02:04.541 --> 02:07.877
I still have no idea
how we were one trophy short.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.338
I counted them early this morning!

02:13.007 --> 02:14.634
Well, Clover,

02:14.717 --> 02:16.970
maybe you should have counted
a little better,

02:17.053 --> 02:18.888
because I sure don't have that trophy.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.099
I definitely don't have it.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.935
-Here you go.
-Ooh.

02:24.018 --> 02:26.855
All right, Your Majesty, we should
get back to the kingdom.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.440
Yeah, ma--What is that wonderful,

02:29.524 --> 02:32.527
shimmery, blingy trophy for?

02:32.610 --> 02:36.030
It's the trophy for the Annual Island-Wide
Academic Tournament.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.240
Nice, huh?

02:37.323 --> 02:39.617
Maurice, why is this the first

02:39.701 --> 02:43.371
I'm hearing of this
Annual Academicalogical thing?

02:43.454 --> 02:47.584
King Julien the Terrible decided lemurs
needed a more pro-lemur curriculum.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.378
He created his own
for-profit charter school

02:50.461 --> 02:53.590
so there would be no oversight
or academic standards whatsoever

02:53.673 --> 02:56.843
to get in the way of him
indoctrinating kids with his awful ideas.

02:56.926 --> 03:00.263
Ah, yes. I remember his motto.
I think it went something like...

03:00.346 --> 03:05.184
<i>"True learning</i>
<i>comes from isolation and fear."</i>

03:05.268 --> 03:06.978
Really was ahead of his time.

03:07.061 --> 03:10.565
Still, that is one fine piece of trophy.

03:10.648 --> 03:11.858
Mm.

03:11.941 --> 03:12.942
Oh, Mo-Mo.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.193
Oh, please kill me.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.613
We're entering that tournament right now.

03:22.911 --> 03:26.039
Welcome, Aye-Ayes, Rats, and Foosa.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.958
And apparently the lemurs decided
to show up for once.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.669
My little peoples,

03:31.753 --> 03:33.880
you are about to take the stage

03:33.963 --> 03:37.717
and show them all the junk you've got
in your scholarly trunk.

03:37.800 --> 03:38.801
Oh.

03:38.885 --> 03:42.388
As you baby geniuses know,
there is nothing in the world

03:42.472 --> 03:45.308
that's more valuable than knowledge.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.601
Except that huge trophy!

03:46.684 --> 03:48.353
Now get out there and make me proud!

03:48.436 --> 03:50.188
You're that confident they'll win?

03:50.271 --> 03:53.024
Yeah, these other teams look way geekier
than ours.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.318
A lot of indoor kids,
you know what I'm saying.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.655
Look, our squad is the cream of the corn

03:58.738 --> 04:00.281
of the lemur charter school.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.910
If they weren't,
would they all be named valedictorians

04:03.993 --> 04:05.745
of their first

04:05.828 --> 04:09.332
Yeah, I started out
as a lowly valedictorian.

04:09.415 --> 04:13.211
And now I'm pretty much
the smartest lemur in the world.

04:13.294 --> 04:17.131
Oh, anybody gonna eat this wad of hair
I just found on the ground?

04:18.299 --> 04:21.302
Oh, that's good hair. Mmm, mmm.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.596
Ooh, this is gonna be so great.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.807
I got a good feeling.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.980
What is photosynthesis?

04:32.063 --> 04:34.065
-Oh, that's easy.

04:34.148 --> 04:35.692
Weird German keyboard music

04:35.775 --> 04:37.986
that Mr. Ted is always dancing to.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.700
-It's been three hours.
<i>♪ Photosynthesis ♪</i>

04:43.783 --> 04:44.617
Incorrect!

04:47.745 --> 04:50.456
When did life begin on Madagascar?

04:51.958 --> 04:53.793
When Frank the Sky God created lemurs

04:53.876 --> 04:56.921
so King Julien the First
would have someone to party with.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.549
-Incorrect!
-Oh!

05:03.886 --> 05:04.721

05:08.349 --> 05:09.475

Incorrect!

05:16.274 --> 05:19.444
Incorrect! Incorrect!

05:20.862 --> 05:22.822
After the first half of the competition,

05:22.905 --> 05:26.367
the Aye-Aye Kingdom holds the lead
with 750 points.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.331
And in last place with zero points,

05:31.414 --> 05:33.291
the Lemur Kingdom.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.710
Why did he have to point out
that we're in last?

05:35.793 --> 05:38.296
I mean, that--that just seems mean. Mean!

05:38.379 --> 05:39.672
And may I remind you,

05:39.756 --> 05:42.175
zero is the lowest possible score,

05:42.258 --> 05:44.052
since we don't do negative numbers,

05:44.135 --> 05:47.388
which are numbers that are less than zero,

05:47.472 --> 05:50.224
for you lemur kids.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.854
We're losing to the rats?

05:54.937 --> 05:58.524
The ones with the king who's always
forgetting how to breathe?

05:58.608 --> 06:00.276
Clover! Maurice!

06:00.359 --> 06:01.903
How did this happen?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.531
Here is the problem, Your Majesty.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.409
This is the textbook
our kingdom learns from.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.577
Notice anything?

06:09.660 --> 06:11.788
Mm, I don't know. A bunch of words?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.915
Wait a minute, Todd got the answers right,

06:13.998 --> 06:16.375
at least according
to this ridiculous textbook.

06:16.459 --> 06:20.004
"Photosynthesis is a weird
German techno music.

06:20.088 --> 06:23.508
It is illegal in this kingdom
and punishable by flogging."

06:23.591 --> 06:25.843
Mm-hmm. I can see why Ted's into it.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.386
Eh...

06:27.470 --> 06:28.387
Heh.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.556
"King Julien the First was lonely,

06:30.640 --> 06:33.142
so Frank the Sky God
made him a bunch of friends

06:33.226 --> 06:36.938
to party with, which is why
we celebrate Franksgiving."

06:37.021 --> 06:39.982
That's from the science section,
by the way.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.443
I never noticed how silly this book was

06:42.527 --> 06:46.614
until we got our butts kicked
by kids who got an actual education.

06:46.697 --> 06:49.200
Probably because you never learned
from that book.

06:49.283 --> 06:52.370
<i>Memorization. Obedience.</i>
<i>Don't Ask Questions.</i>

06:52.453 --> 06:56.082
Huh, Maurice, why have I never seen
this very reasonable

06:56.165 --> 06:58.167
Remember, your parents hired a tutor

06:58.251 --> 07:01.379
and then sent me with you
so you'd have somebody to copy off of.

07:01.462 --> 07:04.048
And while you were cheating your way
through school,

07:04.132 --> 07:07.468
I was at the military academy
learning how to protect you lot.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.053
What a martyr.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.763
Martyr.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.640
And I've been around so long,

07:12.723 --> 07:14.934
I'm actually in the history section.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.103
Mort, how freaking old are you?

07:17.186 --> 07:20.148
Guys, guys, guys,
if Todd memorized everything in this book,

07:20.231 --> 07:22.483
maybe we just need to teach him
some real facts,

07:22.567 --> 07:25.111
and we'll have a shot to at least
score more than a zero

07:25.194 --> 07:27.155
in tomorrow's round of the competition.

07:27.238 --> 07:31.284
You're right, Mo-Mo.
Let's fix this busted school system.

07:31.367 --> 07:32.743
Big news, everybody!

07:32.827 --> 07:34.787
I'm reforming our school!

07:34.871 --> 07:38.291
Uh, re...form?

07:38.374 --> 07:40.293
D

07:40.376 --> 07:44.213
Okay, uh, I'm "overhauling."

07:44.297 --> 07:45.923
Eh. Okay. Making the school gooder!

07:47.717 --> 07:49.719
-Make it gooder.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.721
And I'm talking bigly.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.389
And I'm taking home that trophy!

07:53.473 --> 07:55.516
Oh, what's wrong with the current school?

07:55.600 --> 07:58.686
It teaches patriotism and superstition.

07:58.769 --> 08:01.189
Don't forget being distrustful
of foreigners.

08:01.272 --> 08:02.773
-We live in a jungle.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.192
What do we even need to know?

08:04.275 --> 08:07.236
You're born, do some stuff,
get eaten by a foosa.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.073
It ain't exactly particle physics,
whatever that means.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.784
And to help us
start kicking it new school,

08:13.868 --> 08:17.955
I've brought in the nerd
we all love to hate, Timo!

08:18.039 --> 08:20.082
Everyone loves to hate me

08:20.166 --> 08:22.043
Yeah, i-it's a figure of speech.

08:22.126 --> 08:25.004
Timo has come up
with a new way of teaching

08:25.087 --> 08:28.382
that's even better
than the other "kingdomses."

08:28.466 --> 08:33.012
He's found a common core
that gives kids an easy way to learn

08:33.095 --> 08:34.889
without too much thinking.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.517
I call it "The Basic Idea."

08:39.435 --> 08:42.522
Huh. I thought that would get
at least a smattering of applause.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.398
-That's right, peoples.

08:44.482 --> 08:48.653
Anyone who believes that lemur children
are our lemur future

08:48.736 --> 08:50.530
is welcome to help.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.866
Okay, here goes.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.159
We carry the omicron,

08:55.243 --> 08:57.912
which equals sigma plus ten
to the negative thousandth

08:57.995 --> 08:58.955
delta sub gamma.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.998
Any questions?

09:01.082 --> 09:02.333
<i>♪ A man not afraid to die ♪</i>

09:02.416 --> 09:04.627
<i>-♪ Gave his life for a dream ♪</i>

09:04.710 --> 09:05.920
You call that dodgeball?

09:06.003 --> 09:08.172
I call it pathetic!

09:13.302 --> 09:15.429
-Here!

09:18.391 --> 09:19.308
Kiya!

09:19.392 --> 09:22.853
Oi! Keep your head on a swivel,
pencil-neck!

09:22.937 --> 09:25.106
Head on a swivel.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.360
If I have eight bananas

09:29.443 --> 09:31.153
and you take three,

09:31.237 --> 09:32.655
what do we have?

09:32.738 --> 09:34.407
-Five.
-Wrong!

09:34.490 --> 09:36.701
What we have is a problem, Utta!

09:36.784 --> 09:38.452
Give me back my bananas!

09:38.536 --> 09:40.746
-Thieves!

09:40.830 --> 09:42.915
"That was the day me and Pa

09:42.999 --> 09:47.044
buried old Skeeter
under the sweet Kentucky bluegrass."

09:48.254 --> 09:53.259
"And from that loyal hound dog's grave
grew a weeping willow."

09:53.342 --> 09:54.427
-Ow!

09:54.510 --> 09:55.511
Nailed it!

09:55.595 --> 09:58.514
-Head on a swivel, Mr. Ted.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.976
Todd! Todd!

10:02.059 --> 10:03.185
Smile!

10:03.269 --> 10:05.938
Flash the judges your pearly flippers.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.816
There are no judges, Tammy.
Stop interfering!

10:08.899 --> 10:11.819
We need to see what
these little snot factories really know.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.696
How do you think they're doing

10:13.779 --> 10:16.115
Spectacular?

10:16.198 --> 10:17.491
What's up with those guys?

10:17.575 --> 10:20.036
Stop indoctrinating
our impressionable youths!

10:21.704 --> 10:24.749
Guess not everybody's supporting
our Basic Idea initiative.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.459
Just wait, Mo-Mo.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.044
When they see that every kid

10:28.127 --> 10:29.879
is a legit valedictorian,

10:29.962 --> 10:32.590
they're gonna change their tune.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.425
Mm, mm.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.052
Uh-huh. Done!

10:36.135 --> 10:38.137
-Graded every test.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.847
I've never seen anything like it!

10:39.930 --> 10:41.766
Todd aced his test.

10:41.849 --> 10:45.269
-That's great!
-And everyone else failed.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.937
-Oh, man.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.398
A-aren't you supposed to lead
with the good news?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.025
Told you learnin' was dumb.

10:51.108 --> 10:54.612
We didn't teach anybody anything!

10:54.695 --> 10:58.282
There's no way we can win
the Academic Tournament now!

10:58.366 --> 10:59.617
Let's just drop out.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.411
Focus on helping the rest of the kids
catch up with Todd.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.915
But I already have plans
for my awesome trophy!

11:09.335 --> 11:11.837
♪ ♪

11:13.547 --> 11:15.633
I'll be your trophy, King Julien.

11:15.716 --> 11:18.302
I already have your name engraved on me.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.804
Want to see?

11:19.887 --> 11:20.971
Nope!

11:23.182 --> 11:24.642
Whee!

11:24.725 --> 11:26.602
Todd! As you requested!

11:26.685 --> 11:27.937
Ooh, Todd.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.897
Oh, sweet, sweet Todd,

11:29.980 --> 11:31.482
our kingdom's only hope.

11:31.565 --> 11:34.151
Tell me how you are able
to learn so quickly

11:34.235 --> 11:37.113
so we can teach the dumber kids
how to be less dumb.

11:37.196 --> 11:41.492
Like most actors,
my baby is a superior genius.

11:41.575 --> 11:43.577
He only has to read a line once,

11:43.661 --> 11:45.538
and it's committed to memory.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.665
Same with the stupid school stuff.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.083
Todd!

11:49.166 --> 11:51.043
Ain't that right, sweetie?

11:51.127 --> 11:54.547
Please save me. I hate acting.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.299
You can name any play Todd's ever read,

11:57.383 --> 11:58.426
and he'll recite it. Butterfish?

11:59.635 --> 12:01.429
<i>Othello.</i>

12:01.512 --> 12:02.930
'Tis in ourselves

12:03.013 --> 12:06.058
that we are either thus or thus.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.643
<i>Lysi-sister-strata.</i>

12:07.726 --> 12:09.478
Ooh, Calonicé,

12:09.562 --> 12:11.522
my heart is on fire.

12:13.357 --> 12:16.652
Not bad for a little girl, uh-huh.

12:16.735 --> 12:19.447
Okay, this is something.

12:19.530 --> 12:23.576
If Todd can memorize all the answers
to the questions they'll ask,

12:23.659 --> 12:26.078
he can win the tournament tomorrow
all by his self.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.538
Oh.

12:27.621 --> 12:28.914
Yeah, uh, only problem is,

12:28.998 --> 12:31.625
he'd have to actually know the questions
beforehand.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.544
He would have to actually know...

12:33.627 --> 12:36.005
I'm not liking that thinking sound
you just made.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.674
If we could get the tournament questions

12:38.757 --> 12:40.509
-beforehand...

12:40.593 --> 12:43.387
Did somebody mention skullduggery?

12:43.471 --> 12:44.513
Count me in.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.433
Pancho, we wouldn't even know
where to find the questions.

12:47.516 --> 12:50.311
The Croc Ambassador keeps them

12:50.394 --> 12:54.732
in a briefcase in his bedroom!

12:54.815 --> 12:56.775
I did a little research.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.569
I'm afraid to ask why.

12:58.652 --> 13:01.655
I hit a, let's say, financial snag.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.909
But I found a bookie
laying 6,000-to-one odds

13:04.992 --> 13:06.785
on the lemur kids to win.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.204
We pull this off,

13:08.287 --> 13:10.623
I get to keep my thumbs.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.595
Psst.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.779
Now we just need to find a key
to that case.

13:41.862 --> 13:42.780
Found it.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.283
Wait here.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.748
Sorry, sir.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.750
I didn't realize the hot tub

13:54.833 --> 13:58.295
was already <i>ocupado.</i>

14:01.173 --> 14:02.216
Okay.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.551
I'm just gonna--

14:03.634 --> 14:04.677
Oh.

14:06.762 --> 14:07.972
Ermegersh!

14:08.055 --> 14:09.890
Daddy! Dad.

14:09.974 --> 14:10.933
Dad!

14:11.016 --> 14:12.434
I had a nightmare!

14:12.518 --> 14:13.852
There was a scary monster,

14:13.936 --> 14:16.230
and I was ugly and bored!

14:16.313 --> 14:17.606
There, there, Buttercup.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.984
We'll take care of you.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.528
Yes, let Uncle Croc Assistant heat up

14:22.611 --> 14:24.405
a cup of Golden Julien

14:24.488 --> 14:25.948
and sing you a lullaby.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.159
Clover!

14:30.703 --> 14:31.704
Hmm.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.498
-I'll get him.

14:34.582 --> 14:35.499
Timo!

14:35.583 --> 14:36.917
Yes, Your Majesty?

14:37.001 --> 14:39.545
Get these questions
to the butt camera immediately!

14:39.628 --> 14:43.215
The, uh, uh, butt camera
is actually a copy machine

14:43.299 --> 14:44.884
that washed up in Junk Harbor.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.930
Enough technical science jargon.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.056
Just copy the stuff!

14:51.140 --> 14:53.559
Okay.

15:00.608 --> 15:01.525
Ah!

15:01.609 --> 15:03.319
And vanish.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.240
That Todd kid seems to be
the real deal to me.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.993
He might give us lemurs
a chance at winning.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.954
And you know what happens
after we win that tournament?

15:14.038 --> 15:18.208
Government busybodies telling us all
we have to get real schooling!

15:19.251 --> 15:20.878
But I love the poorly educated.

15:20.961 --> 15:23.672
Fat, dumb, and stupid
means money in my pocket.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.341
Well, amen. Ow!

15:25.424 --> 15:27.134
What if Todd...

15:30.137 --> 15:32.014
You guys are speaking my language.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.017
We thinking hospital or morgue?

15:35.100 --> 15:37.478
No, man! What's wrong with you?

15:37.561 --> 15:39.271
All we got to do

15:39.355 --> 15:41.482
is distract and hide Todd

15:41.565 --> 15:43.442
until after the tournament.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.617
Quiet, you bumpkins.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.912
Ain't you never done
a proper breaking and entering?

15:56.455 --> 15:58.082
Ow! Sharp glass!

15:59.750 --> 16:01.126
Ah, stupid tortilla chips.

16:02.878 --> 16:06.131
Somebody turn that off! Aah! Aah!

16:06.215 --> 16:08.300
Huh?

16:11.428 --> 16:13.681
Where do we think
the little rug rat is at?

16:13.764 --> 16:15.224
And why do I keep whispering?

16:17.101 --> 16:18.477
Too easy.

16:18.560 --> 16:22.022
Like taking a baby from a baby cage.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.607
Where's Todd?

16:23.691 --> 16:27.194
I'm worried sick
about not winning that trophy!

16:27.277 --> 16:29.989
And also about Todd or whatever.

16:30.072 --> 16:30.990
Even if we had him,

16:31.073 --> 16:34.201
he didn't get to memorize the questions
and answers yet, anyway.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.869
We got to go save our little Todd!

16:35.953 --> 16:38.247
I'll begin the investigation immediately.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.665
Oh, I know where he is.

16:39.748 --> 16:42.668
A mother always knows how to find her boy,

16:42.751 --> 16:45.045
especially since he's microchipped.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.715
Got to keep tabs on our investment, y'all.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.341
You know, money, you know.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.218
He's my investment now, too.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.012
Find that little genius, Clover.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.597
Take these with you so Todd can study
on the way back.

16:55.681 --> 16:56.640
-On it!
-On it!

16:56.724 --> 16:58.851
Mort, you're standing in for Todd.

16:58.934 --> 17:01.520
Yay! I'm a little genius!

17:02.604 --> 17:04.064
Oh, look, more hair.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.608
Are you sure about this?

17:06.692 --> 17:08.485
Sure. We throw a disguise on him,

17:08.569 --> 17:12.031
and he pretends to be Todd
until Clover gets back.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.367
Ooh.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.245
Uh, hello. Hello.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.706
I'm, uh, Todd.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.416
Without further ado,

17:22.499 --> 17:24.918
let us begin
with the general-knowledge round.

17:25.002 --> 17:25.836
Uh...

17:25.919 --> 17:29.006
I must get out there
and win this tournament.

17:29.089 --> 17:32.134
This is tailor-made
for a being of my intellect.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.385
You can't go out there.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.387
You don't sound anything like Todd.

17:35.471 --> 17:39.308
True, he does have the silky voice
of a Mongolian eunuch,

17:39.391 --> 17:41.602
but surely I could approximate it.

17:41.685 --> 17:44.146
If you answer the questions,
it'll be cheating!

17:44.229 --> 17:48.358
That Rubicon was crossed
when Julien pilfered the questions.

17:48.442 --> 17:51.153
Todd doesn't wear a monocle.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.404
Touché.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.531
Are you okay, Todd?

17:54.615 --> 17:56.158
I'm Todd!

17:56.241 --> 17:57.868
Mm, should we do a ransom

17:59.661 --> 18:01.121
How about some light scaring?

18:01.205 --> 18:04.374
-Jumping out of closets and such--
-Freeze, kidnappers.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.126
-Hi-yah!

18:06.210 --> 18:07.669
This ain't what it looks like.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.380
Yeah, we was only talking
about light scaring.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.467
-Mm-hmm-hmm.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.101
-Aah!

18:22.184 --> 18:23.811
-Hey!

18:23.894 --> 18:24.937
Nobody move.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.106
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right. All right.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.690
Let's just be calm.

18:28.774 --> 18:29.900
Todd, baby,

18:29.983 --> 18:31.735
it'll be okay.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.362
Be a brave boy

18:33.445 --> 18:37.491
and show the nice man your war face!

18:40.911 --> 18:42.788
All right, Todd,

18:42.871 --> 18:45.749
just commit these hundreds of random facts
to memory

18:45.833 --> 18:48.669
as we run through the jungle,
and we'll be just fine.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.462
Where are they, Maurice?

18:50.546 --> 18:54.258
All they had to do was one teensy,
little heroic rescue.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.555
-Hey.
-Okay, they got Todd.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.558
But how do we switch him with Mort
without anybody noticing?

19:02.641 --> 19:05.060
You know, if you guys need me
to blow something up,

19:05.144 --> 19:06.645
you just have to ask.

19:06.728 --> 19:09.106
I mean, we're all friends.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.316
Nobody needs you to blow anything up.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.901
And nobody likes you!

19:12.985 --> 19:13.902
Oh.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.155
You're always there with the tough love,

19:16.238 --> 19:17.614
you old grizzly bear.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.241
I need it.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.326
It's the air I breathe!

19:21.410 --> 19:22.327
Wait a minute.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.788
I just got a genius plan.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.291
This animal, found mainly in jungles,

19:27.374 --> 19:30.085
is known for being incredibly stupid.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.128
Fire!

19:31.211 --> 19:32.379
There's a fire!

19:32.462 --> 19:33.881
Fire in a crowded theater!

19:33.964 --> 19:35.799
Come on, that is not a plan.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.344
N-not to be Willie,
but we're all gonna die!

19:41.847 --> 19:43.724
Psst. Ted.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.437
Hey. Hey.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.243
We're all gonna die!

20:03.327 --> 20:05.287
Now that we have all returned safely,

20:05.370 --> 20:07.122
we may resume round two.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.290
What happened, Todd?

20:08.373 --> 20:10.042
I think I got kidnapped?

20:10.125 --> 20:11.585
I-I couldn't tell.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.212
It wasn't a great kidnapping.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.172
Well, I'm glad you're here now.

20:15.255 --> 20:18.050
Losing this tournament
wouldn't be the same without you.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.551
Plate tectonics.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.054
T

20:24.640 --> 20:26.850
The atomic mass of sodium.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.143
Correct.

20:29.853 --> 20:31.521
His Holiness, the Pontifex.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.649
-Correct!

20:33.732 --> 20:35.651
-A hammerhead shark.
-Correct! -An October Surprise.
-Correct.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.821
Stupid! Stupid!

20:39.905 --> 20:41.740
-The Big Bang Theory.
-Correct!

20:41.823 --> 20:44.243
-The Little Bang Theory.
-Correct!

20:44.326 --> 20:47.913
Correct. Correct. Correct!

20:47.996 --> 20:50.707
We enter our final round with a tie.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.542
Correctly answering this question

20:52.626 --> 20:55.295
will mean the difference
between victory and defeat.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.381
I invite the two team captains,

20:57.464 --> 20:59.132
Todd from the Lemur Kingdom,

20:59.216 --> 21:01.051
and from the Aye-Aye Kingdom,

21:01.134 --> 21:03.428
Buh

21:03.512 --> 21:06.723
Yeah, it's spelled "B"!

21:06.807 --> 21:09.309
Plus the sound "Brandon."

21:09.393 --> 21:10.602
B'Brandon?

21:10.686 --> 21:12.145
What a stiff.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.398
Todd's gonna crush that kid.

21:14.481 --> 21:15.774
The trophy's mine!

21:15.857 --> 21:17.067
I mean ours!

21:17.150 --> 21:19.152
I can't believe we pulled this off.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.613
I mean, sure,
what we did was horribly dishonest,

21:21.697 --> 21:24.908
and a child was kidnapped
by a radical fringe group in the process.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.119
-But we really might win this thing!
-Hmm.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.121
The decisive round

21:29.204 --> 21:31.623
of the Annual Island-wide
Academic Tournament

21:31.707 --> 21:33.166
is usually a lightning round,

21:33.250 --> 21:35.919
rewarding the student
who memorized the most answers.

21:36.003 --> 21:39.172
Ooh. Todd's gonna crush that dork!

21:39.256 --> 21:41.133
B'Brandon

21:41.216 --> 21:43.010
What a b'dumb name.

21:43.093 --> 21:46.054
But this year
the final round will be decided

21:46.138 --> 21:47.973
by a discussion question.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.558
A what question?

21:49.641 --> 21:52.477
You see, only a lazy, craven society

21:52.561 --> 21:55.731
would value test preparation
over actual learning.

21:55.814 --> 21:58.400
Education shouldn't be memorizing facts

21:58.483 --> 22:00.444
in a sterile testing environment.

22:00.527 --> 22:02.654
Education should provide the tools

22:02.738 --> 22:06.616
to help students become useful,
productive members of society.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.202
Wow. That's really powerful.

22:09.286 --> 22:10.912
I see the error of my ways.

22:10.996 --> 22:14.958
I guess the one
who really got educated today is me.

22:15.042 --> 22:18.462
I now know what I must do
to make things right.

22:23.425 --> 22:27.763
Wow. B'Brandon really did not want
to let us steal this trophy

22:27.846 --> 22:29.097
he rightfully earned.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.683
Yeah. Kid's got a real strong grip.
