WEBVTT

00:15.801 --> 00:17.970
Rebecca! You made it!

00:18.011 --> 00:19.430
Are you kidding, Kate?

00:19.471 --> 00:20.723
Where are you off to?

00:20.764 --> 00:22.891
Spain, Italy and Greece.

00:22.933 --> 00:24.268
Can you believe it?

00:24.309 --> 00:27.396
Dennis bought a yacht.
It's vulgar, I know.

00:27.521 --> 00:29.982
Where is your other half, anyway?

00:30.023 --> 00:34.361
He's probably off closing one
last deal before I whisk him away.

00:34.945 --> 00:36.113
I like to win.

00:46.582 --> 00:48.292
There are some sweet
looking women here, Dennis.

00:48.333 --> 00:49.376
Hook me up.

00:49.793 --> 00:50.711
Hook you up?

00:51.128 --> 00:52.629
You're a married man.

00:55.591 --> 00:56.592
Whoa, who's that?

00:57.551 --> 00:59.803
That's Mia, one of our nannies.

01:00.220 --> 01:01.346
She's your nanny?

01:01.388 --> 01:03.307
My wife only hires trolls.

01:04.349 --> 01:05.601
I wonder why.

01:06.226 --> 01:08.562
Jonah, why don't you
stay a while, hang out?

01:08.854 --> 01:10.064
It's your party, dad,

01:10.272 --> 01:11.148
not mine.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.361
Mommy?

01:19.948 --> 01:20.949
Mommy?

01:22.910 --> 01:23.952
Mommy?

01:25.329 --> 01:26.413
Mommy!

01:26.622 --> 01:27.873
Mommy!

01:28.040 --> 01:29.750
Uh, what is it, honey?

01:29.792 --> 01:31.668
Mommy's a little busy right now.

01:31.710 --> 01:32.669
But, mommy!

01:32.711 --> 01:33.504
Okay.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.718
Oh, my god, Megan!

01:39.760 --> 01:41.470
What happened to you?

01:41.845 --> 01:43.180
Are you okay?

01:43.472 --> 01:44.723
What happened?

01:44.765 --> 01:46.475
Vanessa won't wake up.

02:23.345 --> 02:24.430
Vanessa?

02:24.596 --> 02:25.514
Oh, my god!

02:25.556 --> 02:27.391
Call the police. Call the police.

02:31.270 --> 02:32.438
Vanessa?

02:42.781 --> 02:43.574
Lieutenant?

02:44.950 --> 02:46.076
Mr. Lambert.

02:46.827 --> 02:47.911
I can't believe it.

02:48.370 --> 02:49.538
In my own home.

02:51.832 --> 02:52.833
And my daughter.

02:55.044 --> 02:56.462
Who was Vanessa?

02:57.463 --> 02:58.714
Vanessa was one of her nannies.

02:58.756 --> 03:00.215
She's been with us over a year.

03:00.382 --> 03:01.717
She was upstairs working.

03:01.884 --> 03:02.426
Okay.

03:02.551 --> 03:03.844
Who would want to hurt her?

03:04.970 --> 03:06.430
I'm ashamed to admit it

03:06.930 --> 03:07.848
Vanessa took care of our lives,

03:07.890 --> 03:09.433
but I didn't know much about hers.

03:09.475 --> 03:10.517
You know how it goes.

03:11.018 --> 03:13.228
Hard enough keeping
tabs on your own family.

03:13.771 --> 03:16.482
I want you to stay
home and talk to no one.

03:17.066 --> 03:19.318
We're supposed to leave town
this weekend for two months.

03:19.359 --> 03:21.361
You're gonna have to put that on hold.

03:21.779 --> 03:23.655
My family and i have nothing to hide.

03:25.157 --> 03:26.658
Then we shouldn't have a problem.

04:15.834 --> 04:17.043
Alexx.

04:17.336 --> 04:20.297
She has two stab wounds in
the upper torso, Horatio,

04:20.339 --> 04:21.757
consistent with a knife.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.091
I don't see the weapon.

04:23.675 --> 04:26.929
These footprints look like
some kind of horror movie.

04:27.596 --> 04:29.806
And a five-year-old
girl found her.

04:29.848 --> 04:31.934
Yes, who didn't see the murder.

04:34.519 --> 04:35.395
'Nessa?

04:35.771 --> 04:36.813
'Nessa!

04:42.194 --> 04:43.779
Well, this is interesting.

04:44.363 --> 04:47.366
Her fingernail beds
are already discolored.

04:47.824 --> 04:49.785
They have a bluish tint.

04:49.868 --> 04:52.496
Normally they're colorless after death.

04:53.121 --> 04:54.540
I'll get into this and let you know.

04:54.581 --> 04:55.749
Please do.

04:55.999 --> 04:56.750
Mr. Wolfe.

04:56.792 --> 04:59.419
Hey. The techs have printed
and swabbed all the guests.

04:59.461 --> 05:00.796
They've been cooperative.

05:01.129 --> 05:04.466
Okay, well, the guests at the
party were outside, weren't they?

05:04.883 --> 05:07.636
Oh, yeah, I guess it would make
that glass out of place, wouldn't it?

05:09.763 --> 05:10.973
I'll, um...

05:11.306 --> 05:13.183
I'll bring it to the lab and
make sure it's not the victim's.

05:13.308 --> 05:14.935
Thank you, Mr. Wolfe.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.322
All of these knives
are negative for blood.

05:27.698 --> 05:29.908
Well, if the killer grabbed
the weapon from the kitchen,

05:29.992 --> 05:32.786
it stands to reason they'd
put it back there, too.

05:33.287 --> 05:34.705
Hide it in plain sight.

05:34.830 --> 05:35.455
Yep.

05:39.084 --> 05:40.168
Here we go,

05:41.545 --> 05:43.088
this is the last of 'em.

05:50.429 --> 05:51.179
Nothing.

05:55.559 --> 05:57.603
Can we help you? I-it's Jonah, right?

05:57.769 --> 05:58.979
Uh, yeah.

05:59.354 --> 06:01.106
Just wanted to get something to eat.

06:01.565 --> 06:02.608
Are you okay?

06:03.317 --> 06:03.984
Yeah.

06:04.610 --> 06:06.320
Everything just sucks, that's all.

06:06.528 --> 06:07.279
I know.

06:07.321 --> 06:08.488
I'm really sorry.

06:09.239 --> 06:10.908
Were you very close to Vanessa?

06:11.742 --> 06:12.618
Not really.

06:13.327 --> 06:14.620
But she and Megan were tight.

06:14.786 --> 06:15.579
How so?

06:15.787 --> 06:17.289
They did everything together.

06:18.498 --> 06:21.543
You can see why I wasn't exactly
thrilled to go on our trip.

06:22.169 --> 06:23.212
Mom and dad.

06:23.629 --> 06:25.297
Megan and Mary Poppins.

06:27.216 --> 06:28.133
I don't fit in.

06:28.425 --> 06:30.177
So Vanessa was gonna go with you?

06:30.302 --> 06:32.137
I don't know who wanted her there more,

06:32.387 --> 06:34.431
my parents or my sister.

06:34.640 --> 06:35.432
Jonah,

06:35.515 --> 06:37.851
you'd better remove yourself
from the house until we're done.

06:37.935 --> 06:38.560
Okay?

06:43.732 --> 06:45.192
This is a nice guesthouse.

06:46.026 --> 06:46.777
Yeah.

06:46.818 --> 06:49.905
Well, there are two beds, so I'm
guessing both nannies lived here.

06:51.990 --> 06:55.160
Looks like Vanessa was packing
to go on the family vacation.

06:57.621 --> 06:59.373
I mean, don't get me wrong,

06:59.456 --> 07:02.125
it's not like I'm the
lightest packer in the world,

07:02.167 --> 07:04.461
but who takes all of their
photographs with them?

07:06.213 --> 07:06.797
Yeah.

07:07.506 --> 07:09.383
Inside the picture frames?

07:09.883 --> 07:10.551
Yeah.

07:11.176 --> 07:13.720
This place looks awfully empty.

07:14.972 --> 07:17.391
I don't know that she
was going away on a trip.

07:17.891 --> 07:20.435
No. She was packing to
go away permanently.

07:22.521 --> 07:25.482
It's true, yeah, I
had to let Vanessa go.

07:25.607 --> 07:27.276
In fact, today was her last day.

07:27.442 --> 07:29.361
Were you not happy with her work?

07:29.528 --> 07:31.363
Oh, no, on the contrary.

07:31.780 --> 07:33.490
She did it too well.

07:33.907 --> 07:37.744
When Megan got sick, she
called out for Vanessa.

07:37.911 --> 07:41.582
When she went to bed, she
wanted Vanessa to tuck her in.

07:43.041 --> 07:44.668
Isn't that why you hired her?

07:49.381 --> 07:50.340
There.

07:50.591 --> 07:51.300
All done.

07:51.425 --> 07:52.509
What do you got, sweetie?

07:52.593 --> 07:54.344
A picture of a family.

07:59.016 --> 08:00.642
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

08:00.976 --> 08:05.814
And that's daddy, and that's
Jonah, and, then, that's you.

08:05.981 --> 08:07.441
Oh, my god, I love it.

08:07.482 --> 08:09.651
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:11.236 --> 08:13.113
I know what you must think

08:13.280 --> 08:15.032
that I deserved this.

08:15.157 --> 08:18.619
Two nannies when I'm
only working part-time.

08:19.077 --> 08:21.830
It's not that I don't
want to be a great mother.

08:22.956 --> 08:24.208
I'm just...

08:24.458 --> 08:25.792
not capable.

08:27.502 --> 08:29.213
Are you capable of murder?

08:30.297 --> 08:31.256
Never.

08:32.090 --> 08:34.342
No. Vanessa was wonderful.

08:34.967 --> 08:38.722
Not in a million years would I want
something like this to happen to her.

08:39.014 --> 08:40.849
Well,I hope that that's the truth,

08:41.099 --> 08:42.392
for your family's sake.

09:04.248 --> 09:05.207
There she is!

09:05.332 --> 09:07.501
Hey, I-I'm really sorry. I got behind.

09:07.543 --> 09:11.713
Yeah, I heard you've been at the
gun range logging some serious hours.

09:12.172 --> 09:13.799
Man, you know, in the last month,

09:13.840 --> 09:16.718
I think I've seen more target
people than real people.

09:17.219 --> 09:19.721
Well, hang in there-
it, uh, it gets easier.

09:20.389 --> 09:21.348
Speaking of real people,

09:21.390 --> 09:24.226
any idea who was using the
glass I found next to our victim?

09:24.268 --> 09:26.895
Well, let's see if CODIS is our friend.

09:30.816 --> 09:32.150
Yep, she is.

09:32.192 --> 09:33.610
Wait, CODIS is a she?

09:34.945 --> 09:35.737
Look at this.

09:35.821 --> 09:39.366
The dna from the rim of the
glass matches a reference sample

09:39.408 --> 09:41.577
that we got from one
of our party guests.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.036
Ron Coswell.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.997
Yeah. Look where he works:

09:45.080 --> 09:46.331
Model nannies.

09:46.498 --> 09:49.376
Model nannies - that
can't be a coincidence.

09:49.751 --> 09:52.129
So, I'm guessing Vanessa knew Ron.

09:52.504 --> 09:53.964
Let's find out how well.

10:12.774 --> 10:15.944
Let's see, you earned a
bs in child development.

10:16.570 --> 10:18.614
Scored a 92 outside with our test kids.

10:18.655 --> 10:21.617
You know, we place with some
of the wealthiest families.

10:21.658 --> 10:23.702
And you are very easy on the eyes.

10:23.869 --> 10:25.662
Welcome to model nannies, Heather.

10:25.704 --> 10:26.914
Thank you!

10:29.791 --> 10:31.293
I'll call you later.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.673
Ron Coswell.

10:37.591 --> 10:38.675
Can I help you?

10:38.967 --> 10:41.094
You know a young lady
named Vanessa Waters?

10:42.679 --> 10:44.014
Uh, well...

10:44.556 --> 10:45.766
Yes, I did.

10:45.974 --> 10:49.228
Vanessa was incredibly talented-
it's terrible what happened to her.

10:49.394 --> 10:52.773
We found your drinking glass
next to her dead body, Ron.

10:52.814 --> 10:55.192
Whoa-ho-ho,wait, are you
accusing me of murder?

10:55.234 --> 10:56.818
Vanessa was one of my best clients.

10:56.860 --> 10:59.488
Who was coincidentally
fired this morning.

11:00.739 --> 11:02.449
Vanessa was a rare find

11:02.491 --> 11:03.784
cute, smart,

11:03.825 --> 11:05.285
a caregiver,born and bred.

11:05.661 --> 11:07.412
But the rich are very hard to please.

11:07.454 --> 11:08.872
You run a placement agency.

11:08.914 --> 11:11.250
I imagine you get a
cut on each deal, huh?

11:11.333 --> 11:12.042
Sure.

11:12.084 --> 11:13.126
I put them in good homes,

11:13.168 --> 11:15.504
make sure they get a room,
a car, medical benefits.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.130
For that, I get ten
percent of their salary.

11:17.172 --> 11:20.300
You lost ten percent,
and she lost her life.

11:20.842 --> 11:24.263
No, I just wanted to find out what
happened so it wouldn't happen again.

11:24.930 --> 11:26.890
I can't believe she fired me.

11:27.057 --> 11:28.225
Those children love me.

11:28.308 --> 11:29.142
It's not about that.

11:29.184 --> 11:31.979
What did I tell you the first
day you came in, Vanessa?

11:32.020 --> 11:33.689
To respect the family's space.

11:33.730 --> 11:35.399
Especially the mother's. But I did.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.775
Then why are we having this discussion?

11:36.817 --> 11:39.111
I don't know. They hired
me to watch their children.

11:39.152 --> 11:40.237
That's what I was doing.

11:40.279 --> 11:43.532
No, they hired you to make
up for all of their weaknesses

11:43.574 --> 11:45.784
without rubbing it in their faces.

11:48.036 --> 11:51.123
Now I have to do damage control
and we're both out a lot of money.

11:52.457 --> 11:53.292
That's it.

11:53.834 --> 11:55.210
I left her to pack her things.

11:55.460 --> 11:57.588
You talk a good game, Mr. Coswell.

11:58.171 --> 11:59.172
I have to.

11:59.590 --> 12:02.718
I deal with celebrities,
ceos, politicians.

12:02.759 --> 12:05.804
They all want results
no matter what it takes.

12:05.971 --> 12:07.556
I know the feeling.

12:10.350 --> 12:12.060
- Hey, Calleigh.
- Hi.

12:12.185 --> 12:14.479
I just finished up our girl.

12:14.605 --> 12:16.732
So she was a nanny, huh?

12:16.773 --> 12:19.151
Yes,and seemingly a very good one.

12:19.192 --> 12:20.527
Your parents are well off.

12:20.569 --> 12:22.196
Did you ever have a nanny?

12:23.614 --> 12:24.448
I wish.

12:24.489 --> 12:27.201
It would've been nice to have
a voice of reason in that house.

12:27.242 --> 12:29.328
You know, my mom, she was...

12:29.828 --> 12:33.081
I don't know,she was really more of
a friend than an authority figure.

12:33.123 --> 12:34.917
And my dad is just...

12:36.168 --> 12:38.337
well, we all know that story.

12:39.922 --> 12:42.299
Did you ever figure out why
her fingernails were blue?

12:43.133 --> 12:43.926
Yeah.

12:44.468 --> 12:45.552
I sure did.

12:47.888 --> 12:50.641
You know what made her
fingernail beds discolored?

12:50.724 --> 12:52.309
Cyanosis.

12:52.726 --> 12:54.645
Is that lack of oxygen in the blood?

12:54.728 --> 12:58.565
That's right. Something
compromised her circulatory system.

12:58.857 --> 13:00.442
And her body was fighting it.

13:06.782 --> 13:08.867
I'm gonna go take a little break.

13:23.674 --> 13:26.134
Now there are a lot
of possible causes...

13:26.176 --> 13:28.387
congenital heart disease,asthma.

13:28.470 --> 13:30.097
But she didn't suffer from any of them.

13:30.138 --> 13:31.348
What do you think it was?

13:31.390 --> 13:33.267
Tox will tell us for sure.

13:33.809 --> 13:35.435
But it was the stabbing

13:35.519 --> 13:37.312
that definitely did her in.

13:37.437 --> 13:38.981
Penetration was deep,

13:39.064 --> 13:41.858
knife entered between
the third and fourth ribs.

13:45.404 --> 13:49.157
So her killer was either
passionate or panicked.

13:49.241 --> 13:53.203
And haste leaves behind evidence.

13:53.412 --> 13:54.830
I found something in the wound tract.

13:54.872 --> 13:57.583
I'm not quite sure what to make of it.

13:58.250 --> 13:59.751
I'll take it to Trace.

14:07.801 --> 14:10.971
Seems the fragment Alexx pulled
from Vanessa Waters' chest

14:11.138 --> 14:13.307
is comprised of zirconium dioxide.

14:13.682 --> 14:14.433
What?

14:16.685 --> 14:18.270
There's ceramic in her wound?

14:18.312 --> 14:20.647
Well,how is that possible?
Vanessa was, uh...

14:21.189 --> 14:22.232
she was stabbed.

14:22.274 --> 14:23.317
Exactly.

14:24.276 --> 14:25.611
But I think I know by what.

14:25.652 --> 14:26.904
I have one in my own kitchen.

14:26.987 --> 14:28.322
A ceramic knife.

14:28.947 --> 14:31.992
Yeah,sorry, I'm more of
a drive-thru type of guy.

14:32.576 --> 14:34.870
Well, a ceramic knife doesn't
dull like a regular one.

14:34.912 --> 14:38.123
And,believe it or not,they
can be twice as hard as steel.

14:38.165 --> 14:41.168
So why were there fragments
of ceramic in the wound?

14:41.210 --> 14:43.253
Because ceramic knives are
strong,but they're not invincible.

14:43.295 --> 14:47.007
So if you twist or you
pry it, it's gonna snap.

14:47.174 --> 14:49.176
Like if you wedge it between two bones.

14:54.765 --> 14:56.475
But Calleigh and Eric didn't find any

14:56.558 --> 14:58.602
ceramic knives at the house.

14:59.478 --> 15:01.063
The party was catered, right?

15:01.355 --> 15:03.148
So maybe the catering company used them.

15:03.482 --> 15:04.066
Yeah.

15:06.777 --> 15:07.903
Eric, hey, it's me.

15:07.986 --> 15:09.363
You're at the Lambert house?

15:33.345 --> 15:34.221
What?

15:35.430 --> 15:36.765
I gave my reference samples or whatever.

15:36.807 --> 15:37.724
They told me I can go.

15:37.766 --> 15:39.268
I got another job I got to get to.

15:39.309 --> 15:40.727
You're not gonna make it.

15:40.769 --> 15:44.648
I recognize you from a photo
in Vanessa Waters' room.

15:52.239 --> 15:52.739
Yeah.

15:53.991 --> 15:56.076
Yeah, I... I knew Vanessa.

15:56.118 --> 15:58.871
Which you neglected to
mention in your statement.

15:59.663 --> 16:00.914
Nobody asked.

16:02.207 --> 16:03.750
Where are the knives you used today?

16:03.792 --> 16:05.460
They're all in the back of the truck.

16:05.669 --> 16:07.170
You mind if I take a look?

16:07.337 --> 16:08.589
Be my guest.

16:17.347 --> 16:19.600
How well did you know Vanessa?

16:19.766 --> 16:20.934
We dated a while back.

16:21.059 --> 16:23.061
Broke up, I don't know, six months ago.

16:23.103 --> 16:24.646
And how did that end?

16:24.688 --> 16:25.647
Not good.

16:26.231 --> 16:27.316
Does it ever?

16:28.859 --> 16:31.820
Running into her today was a
total coincidence, all right?

16:31.904 --> 16:34.364
I'm a chef, but I don't
get to choose my clients.

16:34.823 --> 16:35.699
Eric.

16:37.993 --> 16:39.286
There's no murder weapon, H.

16:39.745 --> 16:40.913
Lieutenant Caine!

16:40.954 --> 16:41.955
You have to come inside.

16:41.997 --> 16:44.208
My husband and I, we were just robbed.

16:44.249 --> 16:46.210
A quarter of a million dollars gone.

16:46.835 --> 16:48.629
Quarter of a million dollars,
that's a lot of motive.

16:48.670 --> 16:51.590
Vanessa probably died for it, Eric.

17:00.214 --> 17:01.966
First Vanessa, now this?

17:02.258 --> 17:04.050
Well, there are no
signs of forced entry.

17:04.093 --> 17:05.594
What about fingerprints, Eric?

17:05.636 --> 17:08.763
There are prints all right,but
they're not from anyone's fingertips.

17:08.806 --> 17:10.974
No arches,loops or whorls.

17:11.183 --> 17:13.019
They're from somebody's knuckles.

17:18.691 --> 17:20.067
Killer thought they were being smart,

17:20.151 --> 17:21.861
but knuckle prints are actually unique.

17:22.403 --> 17:25.196
Mr. Lambert, who had access to the safe?

17:25.656 --> 17:27.616
Just me and my wife and our nannies.

17:27.657 --> 17:29.785
You give your nannies
the code to the safe?

17:29.827 --> 17:31.495
In case something happens to us.

17:31.662 --> 17:34.248
Besides the cash, our will is in
there. All of our important papers.

17:34.290 --> 17:36.667
We trust our nannies. We have to.

17:37.084 --> 17:38.919
Your other nanny, what's her name?

17:38.961 --> 17:40.713
Mia. Mia Fernandez.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.298
Where is she right now?

17:43.382 --> 17:44.592
In her room packing.

17:44.925 --> 17:47.386
Since Vanessa's gone,she's
coming with us on our trip.

17:47.428 --> 17:48.763
Go talk to her, Eric.

17:48.888 --> 17:50.931
Yeah, I'm gonna need to speak to her.

17:58.814 --> 17:59.899
Hang on a second.

18:01.192 --> 18:04.445
Mr. Lambert, do you have
a surveillance system here?

18:04.695 --> 18:06.447
No, just an alarm. Why do you ask?

18:06.489 --> 18:08.532
Because we're being
monitored as we speak.

18:08.574 --> 18:10.076
Excuse me, officer.

18:10.743 --> 18:11.661
You see that?

18:11.952 --> 18:14.121
Right there is a camera.

18:31.138 --> 18:31.847
Mia.

18:33.057 --> 18:33.891
Hi.

18:34.558 --> 18:35.643
You're that cop.

18:36.102 --> 18:38.854
You have a minute? I need to ask
you a few questions about Vanessa.

18:40.398 --> 18:41.607
It's weird.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.902
Seeing her stuff like that.

18:46.278 --> 18:47.613
And now she's gone.

18:48.698 --> 18:51.200
You're here to take her place,
though, right, on the trip?

18:52.159 --> 18:53.828
What's that supposed to mean?

18:54.203 --> 18:55.997
Lambert's safe got robbed today.

18:56.038 --> 18:57.498
You know the combination.

18:57.790 --> 18:59.250
Vanessa catch you stealing?

19:00.167 --> 19:01.585
You think I kill her?

19:02.003 --> 19:03.671
Vanessa was my friend.

19:04.505 --> 19:05.965
We were like family.

19:06.507 --> 19:07.675
We had to be.

19:08.092 --> 19:08.884
How so?

19:09.969 --> 19:11.846
The two of us ran this house.

19:12.346 --> 19:13.973
I cooked, she cleaned.

19:14.098 --> 19:16.684
I took their calls, she
took in the dry cleaning.

19:16.726 --> 19:19.228
I thought your job was to
baby-sit the Lamberts' kids.

19:19.603 --> 19:21.188
Are you kidding me?

19:21.689 --> 19:23.232
We're family managers.

19:23.274 --> 19:26.110
We are teachers,
pediatricians, bodyguards,

19:26.152 --> 19:28.487
accountants, marriage counselors.

19:28.529 --> 19:31.324
We did everything the
Lamberts didn't want to do.

19:31.615 --> 19:33.617
Including raise their own children.

19:35.202 --> 19:37.121
You don't sound too happy to be here.

19:38.622 --> 19:40.374
No,I am.

19:42.043 --> 19:42.918
I am.

19:43.544 --> 19:44.670
'Cause if you weren't,

19:44.712 --> 19:48.299
$250,000 wouldn't be a bad
severance package, would it?

19:50.551 --> 19:51.218
No.

19:52.303 --> 19:54.096
Accuse me all you want,

19:54.138 --> 19:55.806
but I didn't do anything.

19:56.057 --> 19:57.808
She was my friend.

20:08.736 --> 20:11.739
So these are the computers
from the Lambert house, huh?

20:11.989 --> 20:13.157
All five of them.

20:13.199 --> 20:17.495
One each for the mom, dad, both the
children, and one for the nannies.

20:17.620 --> 20:19.747
You know, I remember
when we just had a TV.

20:19.789 --> 20:21.832
And we know for sure that there was

20:22.041 --> 20:23.834
a nanny cam in the air purifier?

20:24.043 --> 20:26.295
We do. The camera was
a wi-fi short range

20:26.337 --> 20:29.006
and the signal was being picked
up by one of the computers.

20:29.090 --> 20:30.591
So who's our voyeur?

20:31.092 --> 20:32.385
Mommy dearest.

20:32.426 --> 20:33.678
Kate Lambert.

20:33.719 --> 20:36.472
So she had a spy cam in
the room with the safe.

20:36.514 --> 20:38.724
Does that mean that she
caught the thief in the act?

20:38.766 --> 20:42.436
No, that would be impossible
because somebody moved the camera.

20:44.271 --> 20:46.107
So whoever took the money

20:46.190 --> 20:47.149
knew about the camera.

20:47.233 --> 20:50.027
What I don't get is, if you're
trying to spy on the nannies,

20:50.486 --> 20:52.446
how come you got a camera in the office?

20:52.488 --> 20:53.990
I know, it's the last place they'd be.

20:54.031 --> 20:55.825
But check out this folder
on the mom's desktop.

20:55.866 --> 20:57.451
You won't believe what I found.

20:57.535 --> 20:58.995
It's called "cam clips. "

20:59.036 --> 21:00.496
And that says "Dennis' bathroom. "

21:00.538 --> 21:03.416
And I'm suddenly getting
the urge to cover my eyes.

21:04.625 --> 21:06.627
this was from two weeks ago.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.259
Look, Vanessa...

21:15.344 --> 21:16.470
That's not good.

21:16.554 --> 21:19.724
Mom wasn't spying on the nannies,
she was spying on the husband.

21:19.807 --> 21:21.142
And for good reason.

21:21.309 --> 21:22.977
Vanessa was close to the daughter.

21:23.060 --> 21:24.562
And getting closer to the husband.

21:24.603 --> 21:27.356
You know, I would say that
that is motive times two.

21:31.027 --> 21:34.196
Turns out that it was you
who set up the video camera.

21:36.949 --> 21:37.825
You did?

21:39.076 --> 21:42.163
I can't believe you put a camera in
our house without telling me about it.

21:42.246 --> 21:44.832
You know, I just wanted
Jonah and Megan to be safe.

21:44.874 --> 21:48.586
But in truth, Mrs. Lambert, it's
your husband you don't trust.

21:48.878 --> 21:49.628
Excuse me?

21:50.046 --> 21:52.548
We saw the video on your computer.

21:54.842 --> 21:59.013
You mean the one of my husband and
Vanessa fooling around in the bathroom?

21:59.889 --> 22:02.016
She's a gorgeous young girl, Dennis.

22:02.058 --> 22:03.017
I'm not blind.

22:03.059 --> 22:05.019
Kate, Vanessa and I
weren't messing around.

22:05.061 --> 22:06.520
- Then what were you doing?
- We were talking.

22:06.562 --> 22:07.563
Talking?

22:08.064 --> 22:09.190
About what?

22:10.483 --> 22:11.025
She...

22:14.945 --> 22:16.364
she told me that

22:16.572 --> 22:17.907
Jonah is gay.

22:19.408 --> 22:20.117
What?

22:20.284 --> 22:21.827
Our son?

22:22.578 --> 22:24.622
What are you talking
about? He's not gay.

22:24.664 --> 22:26.791
Vanessa overheard him tell
Craig that he loved him.

22:26.832 --> 22:27.792
Excuse me.

22:28.459 --> 22:29.377
Who's Craig?

22:30.086 --> 22:32.296
Craig was another one of our nannies.

22:33.589 --> 22:35.716
Mia replaced Craig after I fired him.

22:35.883 --> 22:38.511
I told you that a male
nanny was not a good idea.

22:38.594 --> 22:40.429
Is that why you let Craig go?

22:42.264 --> 22:44.558
Jonah denied that
anything ever happened.

22:45.267 --> 22:46.602
But I didn't want the influence around,

22:46.644 --> 22:49.146
so I took out a restraining
order to keep him away.

22:49.230 --> 22:52.233
I thought you fired Craig
because he was flirting with me.

22:53.317 --> 22:54.610
I told you that,

22:55.111 --> 22:56.988
because that's what you wanted to hear.

22:58.864 --> 23:03.369
Is it possible that Craig
thought Vanessa got him fired?

23:03.703 --> 23:04.412
Maybe.

23:04.578 --> 23:06.497
But there's no way that Craig
could have been in my home

23:06.539 --> 23:07.832
this morning without
me knowing about me.

23:07.873 --> 23:10.418
With all due respect, M.
Lambert, but you're not

23:10.543 --> 23:12.253
a very good witness.

23:23.055 --> 23:23.973
Craig Abbott?

23:25.558 --> 23:26.726
I'm Calleigh Duquesne.

23:26.767 --> 23:28.019
This is Frank Tripp.

23:28.060 --> 23:30.771
Thank you for meeting us. We'd
like to ask you a few questions.

23:32.106 --> 23:33.399
Mind giving us a few?

23:41.365 --> 23:42.450
That your girlfriend?

23:43.075 --> 23:44.702
You here to ask about my love life?

23:44.827 --> 23:47.371
No. We want to ask you
about Vanessa Waters.

23:47.455 --> 23:49.165
She was stabbed to death this morning.

23:49.248 --> 23:51.876
Vanessa? No way that's horrible.

23:52.335 --> 23:54.128
But what's that got to do with me?

23:54.170 --> 23:55.421
I don't know. Why don't you tell us?

23:55.463 --> 23:57.423
That's a pretty nasty cut on your arm.

23:58.174 --> 23:59.133
Oh, that?

23:59.592 --> 24:01.302
Got it working at a lumberyard.

24:01.635 --> 24:03.596
Families aren't exactly
clamoring to hire me,

24:03.638 --> 24:05.598
with a restraining order on my record.

24:06.265 --> 24:09.644
I assume you knew about the TRO
the Lambert filed against me.

24:09.810 --> 24:10.561
Yeah, we do.

24:10.603 --> 24:13.773
We also know that Vanessa's the
reason that you got slapped with it.

24:13.981 --> 24:15.399
What, the gay thing?

24:15.775 --> 24:17.276
Vanessa totally misunderstood.

24:17.318 --> 24:19.820
So nothing happened between
you and the Lambert boy?

24:20.071 --> 24:23.032
Dennis Lambert doesn't have the
slightest clue about his son.

24:23.074 --> 24:24.492
The kid's not gay.

24:24.700 --> 24:27.453
Are you saying that Jonah
never said that he loved you?

24:27.495 --> 24:28.746
No, he did...

24:29.205 --> 24:30.581
but like a big brother.

24:31.123 --> 24:33.459
You gotta understand,
Dennis was always working.

24:33.668 --> 24:36.629
I- I told Jonah about
girls, took him fishing,

24:36.671 --> 24:38.130
taught him how to throw a spiral-

24:38.214 --> 24:39.757
stuff dads are supposed to do.

24:39.799 --> 24:41.884
Do you blame Vanessa for being fired?

24:43.844 --> 24:45.763
Well, if she wasn't such a gossip,

24:45.805 --> 24:48.140
I'd still be working there
,if that's what you mean.

24:48.182 --> 24:50.559
So it might feel real good
for a little payback, huh?

24:50.601 --> 24:51.769
No way, man.

24:52.019 --> 24:53.229
Even though Vanessa was wrong,

24:53.270 --> 24:55.189
I know she was just trying
to look out for those kids.

24:55.231 --> 24:56.273
Maybe so.

24:57.108 --> 24:58.442
Who's looking out for her?

25:11.190 --> 25:12.733
Did you get something, M. Wolfe?

25:12.858 --> 25:13.567
Yeah, actually.

25:13.651 --> 25:15.611
I got to thinking about the
footage from the robbery.

25:15.653 --> 25:17.863
And since the thief
kicked the hidden camera,

25:17.905 --> 25:19.698
I figured he'd leave something behind.

25:22.868 --> 25:24.954
See, there's a scuff mark right here.

25:32.211 --> 25:33.838
Looks like a blade of grass.

25:37.091 --> 25:39.552
It's not even real grass. It's plastic.

25:52.732 --> 25:54.608
You know what I'll do, I'll
call around all the party guests

25:54.692 --> 25:56.777
and see if anybody had astro turf.

25:58.237 --> 25:59.947
Ron Coswell.

26:00.114 --> 26:01.240
Can I help you?

26:01.949 --> 26:04.910
No need, M. Wolfe,I
have somebody in mind.

26:16.464 --> 26:18.215
We meet again, M. Coswell.

26:18.424 --> 26:21.594
Hey, I already gave you guys my
fingerprints today at the house.

26:21.635 --> 26:24.013
It's not your fingerprints
we're interested in.

26:28.100 --> 26:30.478
No, M. Coswell, we want
to print your knuckles.

26:30.936 --> 26:32.688
Give me a break. That's ridiculous.

26:32.730 --> 26:34.023
Actually, it's not.

26:34.065 --> 26:37.485
Skin contours and details
of your knuckles, they differ

26:37.985 --> 26:40.446
from person to person,
and even finger to finger.

26:40.488 --> 26:43.115
What, do you got some
kind of knuckle databas e?

26:43.157 --> 26:44.366
No, we don't need one.

26:44.575 --> 26:47.328
I lifted a print off
the keypad from the safe.

26:47.787 --> 26:49.080
If I can match that to one of yours,

26:49.121 --> 26:51.665
well, we'll be back here with
a warrant for your arrest.

26:51.791 --> 26:54.960
So, why don't you save
us the trip, M. Coswell?

26:56.212 --> 26:58.547
We found some astro turf
near the Lambert's home safe

26:58.589 --> 27:01.425
that we believe matches the
turf here in your play area.

27:01.717 --> 27:02.551
Right,

27:03.302 --> 27:05.137
I took a little souvenir from the party.

27:05.471 --> 27:06.222
Then what happened?

27:06.305 --> 27:08.516
Vanessa saw you what you were
doing, and you had to kill her?

27:08.557 --> 27:10.351
No way. She was in on it.

27:10.559 --> 27:12.395
They told you the combination
to their safe, right?

27:12.436 --> 27:14.230
No, they told me that in confidence.

27:14.271 --> 27:17.066
I know how many student loans
you're carrying, Vanessa.

27:17.108 --> 27:21.237
If you don't do this,I'll
make sure you never work again.

27:25.366 --> 27:27.284
I recognized the nanny cam right away.

27:27.326 --> 27:29.078
I'm the one who sold it to Kate.

27:46.470 --> 27:49.932
First,the Lambert took out a TRO
on Craig, then they fired Vanessa.

27:50.224 --> 27:52.601
Other families find out, they'd start
thinking my agency's the problem.

27:52.643 --> 27:54.687
So you figured the Lambert owed you.

27:54.729 --> 27:55.563
That's right.

27:55.771 --> 27:57.732
They were going to
single-handedly ruin my business.

27:57.773 --> 28:00.317
Looks like you beat
them to it, doesn't it?

28:09.201 --> 28:10.244
Hey, Ryan.

28:10.286 --> 28:11.579
Hey, Alexx, what you got?

28:11.620 --> 28:13.831
Vanessa Waters' tox report.

28:15.708 --> 28:17.752
Tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride.

28:17.793 --> 28:20.838
It's an active ingredient in eye drops.

28:20.880 --> 28:25.134
If ingested, it slows down
the central nervous system,

28:25.176 --> 28:29.305
and that causes oxygen
depletion in the blood.

28:29.346 --> 28:32.058
And that explains the blue
tint in her fingernail beds.

28:32.099 --> 28:33.225
You know, Ryan,

28:33.309 --> 28:36.604
people don't ingest this accidentally.

28:37.605 --> 28:40.232
So what you're saying is
that Vanessa was poisoned?

28:40.316 --> 28:42.193
According to her stomach contents,

28:42.234 --> 28:45.279
the last meal she had was
breakfast this morning.

28:45.321 --> 28:48.157
And Mia Hernandez said she did
all the cooking for the family.

28:48.240 --> 28:51.827
Then it may be time to
check Mia's recipe book.

28:51.911 --> 28:53.079
Thank you, Alexx.

28:57.541 --> 28:58.417
Yeah,

28:58.501 --> 29:00.127
I made breakfast this morning.

29:00.169 --> 29:00.920
So?

29:02.254 --> 29:03.672
So do you want to tell me why

29:03.714 --> 29:06.300
you spiced up Vanessa's
eggs with tetrahydrozoline?

29:06.342 --> 29:08.177
What? What's that?

29:08.302 --> 29:09.595
That is eye drops.

29:09.637 --> 29:12.306
I got a tox report that confirms it.

29:13.724 --> 29:14.850
You poisoned her.

29:16.727 --> 29:17.686
All right,

29:18.437 --> 29:19.522
I admit it.

29:20.314 --> 29:22.400
I put the eye drops in her food.

29:35.121 --> 29:36.956
I thought if Vanessa got sick,

29:36.997 --> 29:39.458
then I would get to go on
the trip instead of her.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.877
So, uh, let me get this straight.

29:43.254 --> 29:45.423
You poisoned her to go on a vacation?

29:45.464 --> 29:47.299
I didn't do it for me.

29:47.758 --> 29:49.510
I did it for the kids.

29:50.052 --> 29:54.056
That trip could have been the
best learning experience for them.

29:54.390 --> 29:57.309
All that Vanessa wanted
them to do was have fun.

29:58.060 --> 29:59.687
I don't know, Mia, I
gotta be honest with you.

29:59.729 --> 30:01.689
That doesn't sound so...

30:02.356 --> 30:02.940
bad.

30:02.982 --> 30:05.943
She only packed Ipods and Game Boys.

30:05.985 --> 30:08.696
What about language guides, maps?

30:08.779 --> 30:10.781
A kid show interest in something,

30:10.823 --> 30:12.616
you have to foster it.

30:13.576 --> 30:15.411
Jonah likes swimming,

30:15.494 --> 30:17.747
so I bought him a scuba diving kit.

30:18.956 --> 30:21.083
Vanessa got so mad at me.

30:22.877 --> 30:24.086
So you poisoned her.

30:25.671 --> 30:27.423
And when that didn't work,

30:28.883 --> 30:29.925
you killed her.

30:30.009 --> 30:30.676
No!

30:31.343 --> 30:33.554
I could never have done that.

30:34.388 --> 30:38.768
I just wanted her out of the
picture while we went on our trip.

30:40.811 --> 30:42.480
I'll tell you what's ironic,

30:42.855 --> 30:43.564
Mia.

30:44.356 --> 30:46.776
Mrs. Lambert fired Vanessa this morning.

30:48.319 --> 30:48.903
What?

30:49.111 --> 30:51.447
Yeah, you actually, could
be going on a vacation, but

30:51.947 --> 30:53.657
poisoning someone is a felony.

30:56.369 --> 30:57.912
I don't know what to say.

31:01.290 --> 31:04.001
You could start with saying
"I'm sorry," but, uh...

31:05.544 --> 31:07.088
it's a little late for that.

31:20.184 --> 31:24.271
Ryan said that Mia Fernandez bought
Jonah a scuba diving kit for his trip.

31:25.064 --> 31:28.442
All diving kits,they have
one thing in common: a knife.

31:28.526 --> 31:29.985
A ceramic knife.

31:37.118 --> 31:40.246
Ceramic doesn't rust,so it's
great for deep-sea dives.

31:40.371 --> 31:41.664
And murder.

31:42.206 --> 31:44.875
You know,Jonah definitely has motive,

31:44.959 --> 31:48.129
seeing as Vanessa ratted
out his buddy, Craig.

31:51.048 --> 31:54.260
Can you imagine raising
a family without any help?

31:54.343 --> 31:56.887
I mean, you know,
given the hours we work?

31:57.638 --> 31:59.807
Yeah, I could. Definitely.

32:00.725 --> 32:01.684
Really?

32:01.851 --> 32:03.811
Yeah. Why, you don't
think I'd be a good dad?

32:03.894 --> 32:05.813
No, I think you'd be a great dad.

32:05.855 --> 32:07.982
I just never heard you mention

32:08.065 --> 32:09.400
having children before.

32:09.442 --> 32:11.986
Well, maybe when I find the...

32:12.027 --> 32:13.237
the right girl.

32:20.494 --> 32:21.454
Bingo.

32:22.621 --> 32:24.457
I found Jonah's scuba diving kit.

32:29.962 --> 32:31.255
There's the knife.

32:33.340 --> 32:36.385
Ceramic, with a chipped point,
just like the murder weapon.

32:37.053 --> 32:39.013
I think it's time that
we talked to Jonah.

32:41.474 --> 32:42.516
Why am I here?

32:42.808 --> 32:45.561
Jonah, we found a knife in your bedroom

32:45.936 --> 32:48.230
that matches the one
that killed Vanessa.

32:48.439 --> 32:50.066
What, my-my scuba knife?

32:50.566 --> 32:52.026
I never even used it.

32:52.151 --> 32:53.319
I just got it a couple of days ago.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.196
It has a broken tip.

32:55.571 --> 32:56.530
Well, I...

32:56.781 --> 32:57.907
can't explain that.

32:57.990 --> 32:59.492
I guess it came that way.

33:00.034 --> 33:01.285
Mia got it for me.

33:02.078 --> 33:03.996
I guess she thought
she could replace Craig.

33:05.456 --> 33:09.043
Were you angry with Vanessa
for getting Craig fired, Jonah?

33:10.461 --> 33:11.754
Yeah, I was.

33:12.380 --> 33:14.423
She gave my dad the totally wrong idea.

33:14.965 --> 33:16.967
Okay, help me understand.

33:20.805 --> 33:22.181
I looked up to Craig.

33:22.848 --> 33:24.517
We were friends.

33:25.101 --> 33:26.936
But now, all 'cause of Vanessa,

33:27.144 --> 33:28.312
no more football,

33:28.437 --> 33:29.605
no more poker,

33:29.647 --> 33:31.023
no more go-carts.

33:31.357 --> 33:34.026
Just this stupid trip
with my stupid family.

33:34.193 --> 33:36.529
Is this your way of
putting a stop to it?

33:37.405 --> 33:38.739
I didn't kill her.

33:39.573 --> 33:41.575
Cr-craig taught me better than that.

33:42.785 --> 33:44.120
You have to believe me.

33:44.161 --> 33:45.204
I want to.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.540
I really do, son.

33:56.342 --> 33:57.593
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:57.635 --> 34:00.054
So, do we have a slam
dunk on the Lambert kid?

34:00.137 --> 34:02.473
No, it's anything but, unfortunately.

34:02.598 --> 34:04.683
I ran the knife for victim
blood; I didn't find any.

34:04.725 --> 34:06.644
As a matter of fact, I didn't
find any blood on it at all.

34:06.727 --> 34:08.228
I guess he could have cleaned it.

34:08.395 --> 34:09.647
So, what now?

34:09.688 --> 34:10.940
Well, now it's your turn,

34:11.023 --> 34:13.108
'cause Jonah Lambert said
he never used that knife.

34:13.150 --> 34:15.569
Well, if we can prove he handled it,

34:16.527 --> 34:18.155
we catch him in a lie.

34:25.704 --> 34:27.414
Think I've got something.

34:38.259 --> 34:39.677
It's not the kid at all.

34:39.927 --> 34:41.136
It's Craig Abbott.

34:41.554 --> 34:43.389
The man with the TRO?

34:43.889 --> 34:45.808
He wasn't supposed to be within
a hundred feet of that house.

34:45.849 --> 34:48.143
Yeah, well, let's see
what other laws he broke.

34:51.230 --> 34:52.815
So, Craig, you lied to us.

34:52.856 --> 34:55.859
It turns out you were at the
Lambert house this morning.

34:56.235 --> 34:59.655
And we know this because
we recovered your print

34:59.863 --> 35:01.615
from Jonah's knife.

35:01.866 --> 35:03.450
You think I killed Vanessa?

35:03.951 --> 35:06.245
I do. Craig, I do.

35:08.664 --> 35:10.916
Jonah had a big test before his trip,

35:11.125 --> 35:13.043
and I was a history major.

35:13.460 --> 35:15.004
That's seriously how trotsky died?

35:15.045 --> 35:17.172
Yeah. Ice pick to the back of the head.

35:17.506 --> 35:18.549
Like this...

35:19.341 --> 35:20.676
that's awesome.

35:21.010 --> 35:22.261
You're gonna ace this thing.

35:22.428 --> 35:23.304
Thanks, Craig.

35:23.470 --> 35:25.514
Look, you better get out of here.

35:25.848 --> 35:28.475
I'll go downstairs, text
you when the coast is clear.

35:29.435 --> 35:31.520
I only lied because of
the restraining order.

35:31.562 --> 35:34.106
That's why nobody saw
you at the party, right?

35:34.148 --> 35:35.649
There's a balcony upstairs.

35:35.691 --> 35:37.151
The door's always unlocked.

35:37.192 --> 35:38.485
Climb the drainpipe and you're there.

35:38.527 --> 35:40.738
And you let yourself in and out.

35:46.994 --> 35:48.996
<i>from: Jonah all clear</i>

35:57.838 --> 35:59.840
I freaked out when I saw vanessa.

35:59.924 --> 36:01.800
I couldn't wait to get
the hell out of there.

36:16.649 --> 36:18.943
You gotta believe me. I didn't do it.

36:20.319 --> 36:22.029
I cut myself sliding on the roof.

36:22.071 --> 36:23.447
Stay close.

36:34.375 --> 36:37.419
Okay, so this is the door
that Craig Abbot snuck out of.

36:37.461 --> 36:40.297
Yeah, and if he had to go
out here, so did the killer.

36:40.548 --> 36:43.384
If we find trace from any
other person, that's our guy.

36:57.982 --> 36:58.816
Hey.

36:59.316 --> 37:00.859
Are you going on the roof?

37:01.068 --> 37:01.902
Yeah.

37:02.194 --> 37:04.613
Wait. I don't want you
to end up in the hospital.

37:04.697 --> 37:05.948
I'll be fine.

37:09.368 --> 37:11.453
Can you tell if anyone's been out there?

37:12.830 --> 37:15.291
Maybe not someone...

37:15.541 --> 37:17.251
but some thing.

37:25.467 --> 37:26.760
It's got blood on it.

37:27.970 --> 37:29.054
That's a kid's drawing.

37:29.096 --> 37:30.514
How do you think that got up there?

37:30.723 --> 37:31.765
I don't know.

37:31.807 --> 37:33.851
Maybe someone tossed it out that door.

37:34.184 --> 37:36.312
That's odd. Why do you
think they'd do that?

37:46.822 --> 37:49.658
Because you can't go downstairs
with the murder weapon in your hand.

37:50.034 --> 37:51.285
Is it ceramic?

37:51.994 --> 37:52.786
Yeah.

38:29.698 --> 38:32.868
Matthew, that is the knife
that killed Vanessa waters.

38:32.910 --> 38:35.246
And that is your fingerprint.

38:38.958 --> 38:40.543
Looks like one of ours.

38:41.085 --> 38:42.253
I'm a caterer, remember.

38:42.294 --> 38:43.879
I set all ese knivth for that party.

38:43.963 --> 38:46.340
In addition, we have this.

38:49.552 --> 38:51.679
Some kid's drawing. So what?

38:51.720 --> 38:54.723
This kid's drawing has your
fingerprints, too,matthew,

38:54.890 --> 38:56.267
only this time...

38:56.809 --> 38:58.018
in blood.

39:04.567 --> 39:08.070
I shuffled my schedule around to
work that party to see Vanessa.

39:09.113 --> 39:11.615
I wasn't prepared to
see her with that family.

39:20.749 --> 39:22.543
we broke up because she
didn't want to have kids,

39:22.585 --> 39:25.754
and then there she was looking like
she's having the time of her life.

39:25.796 --> 39:27.631
She was on their payroll, Matthew.

39:27.673 --> 39:28.716
No, no.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.718
It was much more than that.

39:34.305 --> 39:36.056
Never thought I'd see the day.

39:37.600 --> 39:38.475
Matthew.

39:39.184 --> 39:40.311
What are you doing here?

39:40.728 --> 39:41.770
It's nice to

39:42.271 --> 39:44.273
see you playing with those kids.

39:44.690 --> 39:45.399
Megan?

39:46.817 --> 39:48.777
Well, yeah, she's like family.

39:50.821 --> 39:52.948
Oh... this coming from

39:53.866 --> 39:55.618
someone who says she never

39:55.868 --> 39:57.661
wanted to have kids.

39:58.662 --> 39:59.538
No, matt.

40:00.456 --> 40:01.874
I never said that.

40:02.374 --> 40:04.251
I just don't want to have them with you.

40:08.297 --> 40:12.301
I used to dream what it would
be like to have a big house,

40:12.801 --> 40:14.803
kids running around in the yard.

40:15.638 --> 40:18.015
Vanessa was supposed to
be part of that dream.

40:22.186 --> 40:23.103
It's like...

40:24.647 --> 40:27.441
she went out,she did
all this without me.

41:24.748 --> 41:27.001
I was supposed to be
the one in that picture.

41:27.918 --> 41:30.045
But she says I'm not good enough?

41:31.922 --> 41:33.591
It turns out she was right.

41:34.717 --> 41:35.634
Take him.

41:58.574 --> 41:59.658
Lieutenant.

42:00.284 --> 42:02.494
So the killer's behind bars?

42:02.661 --> 42:03.579
He is.

42:04.079 --> 42:05.623
Thought I'd feel more relieved, but...

42:06.624 --> 42:07.958
it just still feels awful.

42:08.542 --> 42:11.086
All this time we spent
trying to insure our future...

42:11.670 --> 42:13.505
it's kept us from enjoying our present.

42:13.714 --> 42:14.882
There's still time.

42:17.593 --> 42:20.262
That's why we are going
to cancel our trip.

42:21.138 --> 42:21.931
Really?

42:22.514 --> 42:24.350
We're still gonna take some time off.

42:25.142 --> 42:26.185
Back home.

42:26.977 --> 42:28.270
Just the four of us.

42:29.021 --> 42:31.190
You know, sometimes life
gets so crazy it'S...

42:31.232 --> 42:33.692
easy to forget your priorities.

42:34.193 --> 42:35.152
Ah,yes.

42:36.445 --> 42:37.780
Priorities.

42:39.740 --> 42:41.033
Take care, folks.
