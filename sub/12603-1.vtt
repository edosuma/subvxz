03:34.990 --> 03:36.630
Well done, girls.
Excellent performance.

03:36.670 --> 03:39.140
You weren't even watching,
Clifford.

03:39.190 --> 03:41.700
- Yes, I was.
- No, you weren't.

03:41.750 --> 03:44.550
- I sensed the vibes.
- Yeah, right.

03:44.590 --> 03:48.340
- He doesn't love us any more.
- I love you like a wildebeeste

03:48.390 --> 03:52.380
loves five lionesses
chewing at his legs.

03:52.430 --> 03:55.020
Hello.
I'm Piers Cuthbertson Smythe.

03:55.070 --> 03:58.350
Today, I'm spending
the first of five days

03:58.390 --> 04:00.060
with the Spice Girls.

04:00.110 --> 04:01.750
- Elton!
- Elton!

04:01.790 --> 04:03.700
- Hey!
- Hello.

04:03.750 --> 04:07.980
- Good to see ya.
- Hi there.

04:08.030 --> 04:10.390
- Great glasses, Elton.
- Thank you.

04:10.430 --> 04:12.580
We've gotta go. Sorry, Elton.

04:16.230 --> 04:18.029
Soon, the Spice Girls

04:18.070 --> 04:20.269
will be stampeding
down this corridor

04:20.310 --> 04:24.940
in a frenzy of chaos and energy
which is their hallmark.

04:24.990 --> 04:26.900
Chickens? How many?

04:26.950 --> 04:29.990
Why are we going round the back?

04:30.030 --> 04:33.020
You said
they were coming this way.

04:33.070 --> 04:35.030
I never said that.

04:35.070 --> 04:38.700
- Want me to cut?
- That would be wise.

04:38.750 --> 04:42.980
There won't be any fans out
here. They're around the front.

04:49.750 --> 04:53.270
- Girls! It's Andy from the Sun!
- Not up the skirts.

04:53.310 --> 04:55.950
What was that, Clifford?

05:09.150 --> 05:10.340
Bye!

05:10.390 --> 05:12.110
Come on. Come on.

05:12.150 --> 05:13.980
Hands off my fluffy toys.

05:14.030 --> 05:15.830
Nobody come in my bit.

05:15.870 --> 05:17.510
Don't touch my wardrobe.

05:17.550 --> 05:20.990
Can you get changed?
We're there in 15 minutes.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.460
Dennis, Albert Hall.

05:22.510 --> 05:25.900
Partner...
we're heavy and rolling.

05:36.310 --> 05:37.900
OK, horoscopes!

05:37.950 --> 05:39.510
I don't believe star signs.

05:39.550 --> 05:43.100
You're Aquarian. Aquarians
don't believe in anything.

05:43.150 --> 05:44.740
I don't believe that, either.

05:44.790 --> 05:48.260
Oh, no! I can't find my boots!

05:50.830 --> 05:54.740
It's always the same.
I never know what to wear.

05:54.790 --> 05:56.940
It must be hard to decide

05:56.990 --> 06:01.030
whether to wear the little Gucci
dress, the little Gucci dress,

06:01.070 --> 06:03.350
or...the little Gucci dress.

06:03.390 --> 06:04.740
Exactly.

06:04.790 --> 06:09.020
I know. Why don't you wear
the little Gucci dress?

06:09.070 --> 06:10.220
Thanks, Em.

06:15.390 --> 06:17.350
- There they are!
- What?

06:17.390 --> 06:22.910
- You're wearing my boots!
- How did that happen?

06:22.950 --> 06:25.260
Typical Leo, borrowing stuff
without asking.

06:25.310 --> 06:29.670
- No, that's Capricorn.
- Don't start on Capricorns.

06:29.710 --> 06:31.060
That's it!

06:31.110 --> 06:33.910
- Have them back!
- I don't want 'em!

06:36.430 --> 06:38.900
- Excuse me!
- What?

06:38.950 --> 06:42.070
- What do you think of this?
- It's great.

06:43.510 --> 06:46.310
A press conference's coming up.

06:46.350 --> 06:50.260
That means smiling
and answering dumb questions.

06:50.310 --> 06:54.190
It really is exciting.
We're breaking the news now.

06:54.230 --> 06:56.740
Next Saturday, the Spice Girls

06:56.790 --> 06:59.910
perform live at the Albert Hall.

06:59.950 --> 07:02.860
- Are you excited?
- Very excited.

07:02.910 --> 07:04.580
It'll be fantastic.

07:04.630 --> 07:07.300
It's gonna be broadcast live
throughout the world.

07:07.350 --> 07:08.910
How many countries?

07:08.950 --> 07:10.750
- Millions.
- Maybe more.

07:10.790 --> 07:13.180
Have you a message
for your fans?

07:13.230 --> 07:14.420
Yes.

07:16.390 --> 07:17.900
To the people in France.

07:20.910 --> 07:22.790
They're huge in Portugal.

07:22.830 --> 07:25.790
And to the people in Leeds:
"Northerners!"

07:25.830 --> 07:29.740
I don't know what that means,
but it's gonna be great.

07:29.790 --> 07:31.510
They are adorable.

07:31.550 --> 07:36.020
- You haven't shaved for us.
- Well, I...

07:36.070 --> 07:38.660
- I've got what you want.
- Watch this!

07:38.710 --> 07:40.510
These are the Spice Girls.

07:40.550 --> 07:43.350
I've seen them.
I like the blonde one.

07:43.390 --> 07:45.950
- No, Sporty.
- Yeah, sporty one's good.

07:45.990 --> 07:48.660
This is what our movie
should be about.

07:48.710 --> 07:50.830
They're cute.
They're hip, they're wacky.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.270
But can they act?

07:52.310 --> 07:55.380
Did anyone care
if Marilyn Monroe could act?

07:55.430 --> 07:57.230
All they cared,
was she in focus?

07:57.270 --> 08:00.820
I've got an idea.
You're gonna love it.

08:00.870 --> 08:03.860
It's the Spice Girls.

08:03.910 --> 08:07.300
There's five of them,
and they're singers...

08:07.350 --> 08:09.990
I love it.
We pitch this afternoon.

08:14.270 --> 08:15.260
Yes, Chief.

08:15.310 --> 08:18.380
Are the girls ready
for Saturday?

08:18.430 --> 08:22.740
They've got fire in their eyes,
hunger in their bellies

08:22.790 --> 08:24.430
and great big shoes
on their feet.

08:24.470 --> 08:27.270
They're raring to go.

08:27.310 --> 08:30.750
Remember that now
is the dangerous time.

08:30.790 --> 08:33.179
They've had success
very quickly,

08:33.230 --> 08:35.700
so get ready for the backlash.

08:35.750 --> 08:38.980
When the speeding melon
hits the wall...

08:39.030 --> 08:42.470
it's Christmas for the crows.

08:42.510 --> 08:45.790
Shall I go after the paparazzi?

08:45.830 --> 08:49.190
'I could start kicking
arses, stir things up.'

08:49.230 --> 08:51.190
There's no need
for any stirring.

08:51.230 --> 08:53.300
Put cats among the pigeons.

08:53.350 --> 08:56.420
Leave the pigeons alone.

08:56.470 --> 09:00.990
Watch the feathers fly,
get some blood on the walls.

09:01.030 --> 09:04.230
- No!
- Sorry, Chief, just an idea.

09:04.270 --> 09:07.820
There'll be time
for that soon enough.

09:07.870 --> 09:11.830
The drummer who is
without sticks has no backbeat.

09:11.870 --> 09:13.540
Absolutely.

09:14.590 --> 09:16.100
Right, Puss?

09:16.150 --> 09:19.110
- What did he say?
- I haven't a clue...

09:19.150 --> 09:21.950
but I know that he's right.

09:21.990 --> 09:24.710
Drummer? Drummer.

09:54.870 --> 09:58.580
Remember, the camera is
the window to the soul.

09:58.630 --> 10:00.380
- Window to the soul.
- That's it.

10:00.430 --> 10:02.100
Through the eyes, obviously.

10:02.150 --> 10:05.780
I wanna take my audience
into their mind's eye,

10:05.830 --> 10:08.260
and focus on their
deepest subconscious.

10:08.310 --> 10:09.790
Deepest subconscious.

10:09.830 --> 10:12.500
That's it, Enzo. Got it? Great.

10:12.550 --> 10:16.260
So track, track, track,
track, and then...

10:16.310 --> 10:18.590
We'll need a longer lens.

10:21.190 --> 10:22.590
What's going on?

10:23.310 --> 10:24.820
Sorry. My fault.

10:24.870 --> 10:27.910
- Sort your fingers out!
- Left your boxing gloves on?

10:27.950 --> 10:29.460
Once again, please.

10:29.510 --> 10:31.310
That was absolutely perfect

10:31.350 --> 10:33.710
without being actually any good.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.180
Once again, then.

10:35.230 --> 10:37.660
- Hiya.
- Hi, Nic!

10:37.710 --> 10:40.180
Let's keep the momentum
going, please.

10:40.230 --> 10:43.190
- Time to quit.
- After a short break then.

10:43.230 --> 10:45.620
Are you all right?

10:45.670 --> 10:48.980
Look at that emotion.
Real, raw emotion.

10:49.030 --> 10:51.590
Come on, boys!
Capture that magic!

10:51.630 --> 10:53.220
Quickly.

10:53.270 --> 10:54.940
How are you feeling?

10:54.990 --> 10:58.820
All right,
except my back's done in

10:58.870 --> 11:01.780
and I haven't seen
my feet for weeks.

11:01.830 --> 11:04.710
- I hear they're really fat.
- They are...not.

11:04.750 --> 11:06.180
How's baby?

11:06.230 --> 11:09.980
How would you feel being
carried around in a waterbed?

11:10.030 --> 11:11.620
Very lucky.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.100
It kicked!

11:13.150 --> 11:15.380
- When's it due?
- Last week.

11:15.430 --> 11:17.790
You ought to charge it storage.

11:17.830 --> 11:21.140
- So...how's Trevor?
- Trevor's left me.

11:21.190 --> 11:22.910
I don't believe it.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.590
Sound running.

11:24.630 --> 11:27.620
Would you mind
not filming, please?

11:27.670 --> 11:28.900
Cut.

11:28.950 --> 11:32.660
I knew Trevor was irresponsible,
but now he's proved it.

11:32.710 --> 11:34.380
What a complete...

11:34.430 --> 11:37.790
I want to show
the real Spice Girls.

11:37.830 --> 11:41.380
I want to crash through
the show-biz facade

11:41.430 --> 11:43.230
and reveal the truth.

11:43.270 --> 11:47.790
So long as you crash through
the show-biz facade on schedule.

11:47.830 --> 11:50.580
And don't get in anybody's way.

11:52.870 --> 11:55.910
Yes, well,
a smile costs nothing.

11:55.950 --> 11:58.380
Nic, it'll be all right.

11:58.430 --> 11:59.580
Oh, no.

11:59.630 --> 12:00.590
- What?
- What?

12:00.630 --> 12:03.860
- I think I am getting broody.
- Oh, no!

12:03.910 --> 12:08.380
Wait till you start having kids.
That'd be really weird.

12:13.590 --> 12:17.380
How does my Gloria
gets her clothes so dirty?

12:17.430 --> 12:18.750
Bless her.

12:18.790 --> 12:23.500
My poor back.

12:23.550 --> 12:27.940
How can you have more kids?
You've got six already.

12:27.990 --> 12:30.350
Is it six?

12:30.390 --> 12:32.140
They're cute
when they're little,

12:32.190 --> 12:35.020
then they grow up
to be little bleeders.

12:35.070 --> 12:38.510
Thank God for boarding school.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.780
- Our Terry goes to me...
- Cheers.

12:40.830 --> 12:43.190
He goes,
"Ma, I wanna be a singer."

12:43.230 --> 12:46.540
I said,
"Get yourself a proper job."

12:46.590 --> 12:49.020
Does he listen? No.

12:49.070 --> 12:51.350
They never do. I mean...

12:51.390 --> 12:54.220
Darling, kids today,
they don't know...

12:54.270 --> 12:55.750
how lucky they are!

12:57.150 --> 13:00.900
Brucey! Demi!
Turn that bloody racket down!

13:00.950 --> 13:02.990
There's the small matter

13:03.030 --> 13:05.750
of an extremely live gig
on Saturday.

13:05.790 --> 13:07.060
We're coming.

13:07.110 --> 13:08.940
I don't want you to go.

13:08.990 --> 13:11.270
- Take care.
- See you later.

13:11.310 --> 13:12.630
We're coming.

13:12.670 --> 13:14.790
- I need to wee.
- Yeah, so do I.

14:16.950 --> 14:18.020
Down here. Quick.

14:18.070 --> 14:19.390
Baby Spice! Get her shoes!

14:19.430 --> 14:22.710
- Which one's Baby?
- The blonde one.

14:45.350 --> 14:46.940
- Posh one.
- Which one?

14:46.990 --> 14:48.660
The one that looks posh.

15:21.110 --> 15:23.910
Across to Geri. Hips. Good.
This is a good bit.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.190
"Spice Girls set
to conquer the globe."

16:09.710 --> 16:11.990
Look at that, Brad.

16:12.030 --> 16:14.500
"Spice Girls set
to conquer the globe."

16:14.550 --> 16:16.380
Why can't I pick up a paper

16:16.430 --> 16:18.790
without seeing them
all over the front page?

16:18.830 --> 16:23.380
- You told us to write that.
- I know, I know!

16:23.430 --> 16:27.900
As long as they sell newspapers,
we'll have to write about them.

16:27.950 --> 16:31.940
I'm sick of them!
We need a new angle.

16:31.990 --> 16:35.950
Who cares if the Spice Girls
get to Number One again?

16:35.990 --> 16:40.270
Who cares if they climb
up Mount Everest on an ostrich,

16:40.310 --> 16:42.700
or find a cure for déjà vu?

16:42.750 --> 16:43.820
Not me.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.750
Or if they find a cure
for déjà vu?

16:46.790 --> 16:48.190
Not me.

16:48.230 --> 16:51.980
I've got a better idea.
Try this for size.

16:52.030 --> 16:57.710
"Spice Girls' live show
cancelled."

16:57.750 --> 16:59.630
That's not bad.

16:59.670 --> 17:03.820
"Spice Girls fall out."

17:04.950 --> 17:08.069
"Spice Girls...split up!"

17:09.190 --> 17:13.069
Think how many copies
that headline will sell.

17:13.109 --> 17:16.020
- I like it!
- I can make it happen!

17:16.069 --> 17:17.579
Me, Kevin McMaxford.

17:17.630 --> 17:20.670
I put them there,
I can bring 'em down!

17:20.710 --> 17:23.270
- Yes!
- Who's gonna help me?

17:23.310 --> 17:26.349
Who is gonna help me
take on Girl Power

17:26.390 --> 17:28.980
and bring it crashing
to the ground?

17:29.030 --> 17:30.780
I'll find someone, Kevin.

17:30.830 --> 17:33.420
I just wish
you wouldn't get so upset.

17:33.870 --> 17:37.390
It is dangerous
to store moisurising cream

17:37.430 --> 17:39.100
in the refrigerator.

17:39.150 --> 17:42.110
It can be mistaken
for mayonnaise.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.990
Check.

17:45.030 --> 17:48.990
- What do you mean, "Check"?
- My bishop's got your king.

17:49.030 --> 17:50.990
- Where?
- There.

17:51.030 --> 17:54.070
Move it in front
or out of the way.

17:54.110 --> 17:56.390
I'll move that fairground horse.

17:56.430 --> 17:58.710
- Sort that out.
- You can't do that.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.710
- Says who?
- Says Mr Chess.

18:00.750 --> 18:04.060
- It's in the rules.
- I'm gonna break the rules

18:04.110 --> 18:08.070
and set this fairground
horse free. There.

18:08.110 --> 18:10.020
I'll slap you in a minute.

18:14.110 --> 18:17.740
It's obvious that the
Spice Girls are movie stars.

18:17.790 --> 18:22.100
We've worked
on this idea for months.

18:22.150 --> 18:25.140
Can we turn off
our cellphones?

18:25.190 --> 18:27.070
Respect for the writer.

18:29.870 --> 18:32.150
OK, five girls, five lives.

18:32.190 --> 18:37.110
One story as old as time itself,
but as fresh as newly-cut grass.

18:37.150 --> 18:40.430
- And that's fresh.
- The girls play five sisters

18:40.470 --> 18:43.700
whose parents disappeared
during the Harrod's sale

18:43.750 --> 18:45.710
and were never seen again.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.500
As if ripped
from today's headlines.

18:47.550 --> 18:49.060
Now they live at home,

18:49.110 --> 18:51.540
struggling to support
a grandmother

18:51.590 --> 18:53.870
who suffers from some
mysterious wasting disease.

18:53.910 --> 18:55.230
I've got tears.

18:55.270 --> 19:00.190
Their only hope lies with
the middle sister, Melanie C,

19:00.230 --> 19:04.300
who's convinced she could be
an Olympic ski-jump champion

19:04.350 --> 19:08.260
if only she could overcome
her fear of heights and snow

19:08.310 --> 19:10.300
and find a pair of skis.

19:12.070 --> 19:13.340
That's amazing.

19:13.390 --> 19:14.510
That's fantastic.

19:14.550 --> 19:17.460
- What do you think?
- It stinks.

19:18.550 --> 19:21.270
Of course it stinks,
but it's a start.

19:21.310 --> 19:25.670
We're cooking here.
This is a stew, a gumbo -

19:25.710 --> 19:27.990
a jambalaya, if you will.

19:28.030 --> 19:29.540
We're just jamming.

19:29.590 --> 19:31.660
OK, here's another idea.

19:33.230 --> 19:34.350
Crocodiles...

19:38.990 --> 19:43.350
If you want tickets
to the Spice Girls' live gig,

19:43.390 --> 19:47.910
you're too late.
But they're with me now...

19:47.950 --> 19:50.460
- Oh, turn it off.
- All right.

19:50.510 --> 19:53.500
What's it like to be Baby Spice?

19:53.550 --> 19:56.860
Do you think I'm always
gonna be seen as Baby Spice,

19:56.910 --> 19:59.580
even when I'm...30.

19:59.630 --> 20:04.390
- You play up to it, Emma.
- No, I don't.

20:04.430 --> 20:07.900
- You're doing it now.
- I am not!

20:07.950 --> 20:10.940
Em, you've got this
dead cute little smile,

20:10.990 --> 20:13.420
so you can get away
with anything.

20:14.830 --> 20:17.470
Ladies and gentlemen....

20:18.470 --> 20:20.540
Four horrible murders...

20:20.590 --> 20:22.500
perpetrated by the same...

20:22.550 --> 20:24.140
ruthless psychopath.

20:24.190 --> 20:28.870
Each victim riddled
with 100 machine-gun bullets.

20:28.910 --> 20:30.500
But who is it?

20:30.550 --> 20:32.380
Professor Schutzman?

20:32.430 --> 20:34.660
Father Conan Murphy?

20:34.710 --> 20:36.460
Lady Matilda Davenport?

20:36.510 --> 20:37.660
Or...

20:37.710 --> 20:39.940
Miss Emma...

20:39.990 --> 20:41.660
Bunton?

20:41.710 --> 20:44.860
The murderer is...

20:45.990 --> 20:47.580
Father Conan Murphy!

20:48.990 --> 20:51.420
I am fed up with people

20:51.470 --> 20:53.980
thinking I talk
about clothes all the time.

20:54.030 --> 20:56.940
People only judge you
on what you look like.

20:56.990 --> 20:58.340
Exactly.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.430
It's the same with fish.

21:00.470 --> 21:03.590
You've got the spotty one
that's wacky,

21:03.630 --> 21:06.060
the fluffy one that's cute,

21:06.110 --> 21:08.070
and this ugly loser one

21:08.110 --> 21:11.580
that reminds me
of my ex-boyfriend Steven.

21:12.870 --> 21:17.790
Did you know the largest fish
in the world is the manta ray?

21:17.830 --> 21:19.630
And there's the ginger one

21:19.670 --> 21:23.110
that is full of useless
information about manta rays.

21:23.150 --> 21:24.630
I don't get it.

21:24.670 --> 21:28.630
Why do people
stereotype us all the time?

21:33.830 --> 21:36.550
We're getting predictable.

21:36.590 --> 21:38.820
Maybe I should stop being loud.

21:38.870 --> 21:41.150
Fat chance.

21:41.190 --> 21:43.070
Hold it there.

21:43.110 --> 21:44.990
Now give it to me.

21:45.030 --> 21:47.260
Why don't we give
each other new characters?

21:47.310 --> 21:50.780
- Like what?
- What about Bricklayer Spice?

21:50.830 --> 21:55.950
- Sexy! Come on, energy!
- Or Trainspotting Spice.

21:55.990 --> 21:57.740
Smashing!

21:57.790 --> 22:01.230
How about Sporty-But-Interested-
In-Other-Things Spice?

22:01.270 --> 22:03.180
Go for it, girls!

22:03.230 --> 22:05.660
Cheesed-Off-With-Cheesy-
Photo-Sessions Spice.

22:05.710 --> 22:08.670
- There you are.
- Thank you!

22:08.710 --> 22:09.620
And again.

22:09.670 --> 22:10.990
Let's go do our own thing.

22:11.030 --> 22:11.990
Come on.

23:04.710 --> 23:09.100
Hello, Mr Bond.
Or can I call you James?

23:14.870 --> 23:16.670
Do you want that
shaken or stirred?

23:16.710 --> 23:19.670
That's it. I'm off. I'm going.

23:24.470 --> 23:26.190
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

23:26.230 --> 23:28.190
I'm so sporty!

23:38.750 --> 23:40.500
My mummy's my best friend.

23:42.790 --> 23:44.990
I'm just too posh.

23:46.350 --> 23:48.390
When are Liverpool gonna
win the cup, like, eh?

23:48.430 --> 23:49.910
Are we finished yet?

23:51.310 --> 23:52.900
Girl Power.

23:52.950 --> 23:54.910
Feminism.
Do you know what I mean?

23:54.950 --> 23:56.540
Oh, no.

24:01.550 --> 24:03.270
I feel as if
I'm being strangled.

24:05.350 --> 24:08.340
I nearly fell off these shoes
and sprained my ankle.

24:08.390 --> 24:11.300
These are really tight.
They go right up my bum.

24:11.350 --> 24:14.230
- These are really comfy.
- Don't even think about it.

24:14.270 --> 24:16.630
- I'm getting these off.
- I need some platforms.

24:16.670 --> 24:18.020
How can you wear these, Geri?

24:18.070 --> 24:20.430
You look crap
in my clothes anyway.

24:20.830 --> 24:23.110
Yes! I've got
the man for the job.

24:23.150 --> 24:25.270
He did the Fergie
toe-sucking pictures,

24:25.310 --> 24:27.540
he got the Teletubbies
taking a poo,

24:27.590 --> 24:30.420
and he can get Clinton tucking
his T-shirt into his underpants.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.540
Sounds great,
but where the hell is he?

24:32.590 --> 24:33.660
I'm here.

24:35.550 --> 24:38.060
How do we know you're any good?

24:38.110 --> 24:41.820
7.45. You sniffing your socks
before putting them on.

24:41.870 --> 24:45.700
8.55. You in the lift,
picking your nose.

24:45.750 --> 24:46.900
Another bogey breakfast.

24:46.950 --> 24:48.510
He's good.

24:48.550 --> 24:50.140
You again.

24:50.190 --> 24:53.180
Behind the bike sheds
with Eileen when you were 12.

24:53.230 --> 24:56.140
He's very good.

24:56.190 --> 24:57.700
He's gone.

25:05.230 --> 25:07.700
Now hear this.

25:07.750 --> 25:10.030
After using the showers,

25:10.070 --> 25:14.380
could people please pick up
the hair in the plugholes?

25:14.430 --> 25:17.550
It's unhygienic
and can lead to flooding.

25:17.590 --> 25:20.340
Clifford, can't you
just tell us normally?

25:23.270 --> 25:26.550
Next stop - publicity party.

25:26.590 --> 25:28.180
Beautiful people,
reporters, interviews,

25:28.230 --> 25:30.620
lots of finger food. Have fun.

25:30.670 --> 25:31.900
That is all.

25:31.950 --> 25:34.260
- They're here. Don't look.
- I'm not looking.

25:34.310 --> 25:37.220
I hate these parties.
Everyone dresses over the top.

25:37.270 --> 25:41.150
They all ask how you are,
and they don't even care.

25:41.190 --> 25:46.660
I should be at the footie now
and... Do you know him?

25:46.710 --> 25:47.940
Sorry.

25:48.430 --> 25:51.500
- Do you know who I am?
- Who are you?

25:51.550 --> 25:52.670
Piers Cuthbertson Smythe.

25:52.710 --> 25:54.590
I'm with the Spice Girls.

25:54.630 --> 25:57.750
Your name's not down,
you're not coming in.

25:57.870 --> 25:59.990
You said he'd recognise you.

26:00.030 --> 26:03.710
I have to go to all the shows -
Gucci, Pucci, Fendi...

26:03.750 --> 26:05.980
I was very disappointed
with their spring collections.

26:06.030 --> 26:09.780
As for McQueen and Galliano,
I could go either way.

26:09.830 --> 26:12.630
What do you think
about manta rays?

26:14.110 --> 26:16.070
Oh, yes.

26:16.110 --> 26:19.100
Marvellous designer, Manta Ray.
I love Manta Ray.

26:19.150 --> 26:22.620
These are Manta Ray shoes.
These are his glasses.

26:22.670 --> 26:26.950
Bob, we have to sort your hair
out. I'm gonna do your hair.

26:26.990 --> 26:30.380
What's wrong with the hair?
Everybody's going on about it.

26:30.430 --> 26:33.470
We don't want to
threaten a man's masculinity.

26:33.510 --> 26:35.500
- Of course not.
- Or be dominating.

26:35.550 --> 26:36.740
Of course not.

26:36.790 --> 26:40.940
Men sometimes get all nervous
and don't know what to say.

26:40.990 --> 26:45.190
Well, um...things...

26:45.230 --> 26:47.380
I'm gonna go to the toilet.

26:47.430 --> 26:48.580
Hello, Trish!

26:48.630 --> 26:53.070
I've been talking
to a Spice Girl.

26:53.110 --> 26:54.380
I know.

26:54.430 --> 26:57.100
Bob, I think you look great.

26:57.150 --> 26:59.190
What the hell have you done?

26:59.230 --> 27:02.350
- Nicola, Nicola! Remember me?
- Yes. Hi.

27:02.390 --> 27:05.110
We're with her.
We have to get in.

27:05.150 --> 27:06.300
Spare ticket.

27:06.350 --> 27:08.180
We have a ticket.

27:08.230 --> 27:10.790
"And tonight is the night,

27:10.830 --> 27:13.030
"When three become one."

27:13.070 --> 27:15.660
- Thank you.
- He's great, isn't he?

27:15.710 --> 27:18.220
I've got something
important to ask you.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.500
If you don't want
to do it, it's all right.

27:20.550 --> 27:24.910
I was thinking one of you
could be godmother to the baby.

27:24.950 --> 27:30.310
But you're all my best mates.
I want you all to be godmothers.

27:30.350 --> 27:33.420
It's got to be
a Liverpool supporter.

27:33.470 --> 27:36.860
Hang on. Do godmothers
get stretch marks?

27:36.910 --> 27:40.540
Sorry to interrupt,
it's interview and photo time.

27:40.590 --> 27:43.660
- Do we have to?
- Yes, it's your job.

27:43.710 --> 27:46.780
- I'm so sorry.
- See you later.

27:48.950 --> 27:51.940
Girls, it's publicity
for Saturday's show.

27:55.750 --> 27:58.390
Are you part
of the Spice phenomenon?

27:58.430 --> 28:00.790
No, I'm just nobody.

28:00.830 --> 28:03.190
Excuse me a minute.

28:15.270 --> 28:17.990
So we're on a wide-angled lens?

28:18.030 --> 28:19.380
Running.

28:19.430 --> 28:20.780
And now tonight,

28:20.830 --> 28:23.260
I'll be asking
the big questions.

28:23.310 --> 28:27.430
How are relationships moulded
in this kaleidoscopic world

28:27.470 --> 28:28.980
the Spice Girls inhabit?

28:29.030 --> 28:31.540
Let's find out, shall we?

28:31.590 --> 28:35.140
So do you have
any time for boys?

28:35.190 --> 28:37.750
Boys? Doesn't ring a bell.

28:37.790 --> 28:41.390
I think you should just
be able to wheel them in,

28:41.430 --> 28:43.420
then they're there,
and then that's it.

28:43.470 --> 28:44.660
Really?

28:44.710 --> 28:46.990
And order them like a pizza.

28:47.030 --> 28:50.940
I'll have a deep pan, 6-foot,
green eyes, pair of loafers,

28:50.990 --> 28:52.470
and no socks.

28:52.510 --> 28:54.020
Yeah, no cheese.

28:54.070 --> 28:56.820
But you like boys,
don't you, Geri?

28:56.870 --> 28:59.070
Come on.
Is the Pope a Catholic?

28:59.110 --> 29:01.700
Apparently he is, yes.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.580
Church leaders
have reacted with shock

29:06.630 --> 29:08.780
to reports that the Spice Girls

29:08.830 --> 29:11.790
have cast doubt on the religious
conviction of the Pope.

29:11.830 --> 29:13.340
That's more like it!

29:13.390 --> 29:16.700
A Vatican spokesman said
the pontiff was confused

29:16.750 --> 29:20.580
by the suggestion that
he might not be Catholic.

29:20.630 --> 29:23.910
We asked the Bishop
of Candleford what he thought.

29:23.950 --> 29:26.310
It's a terrible suggestion,
almost blasphemous.

29:26.350 --> 29:28.390
Of course
the Pope's a Catholic!

29:28.430 --> 29:31.580
Otherwise he wouldn't
have become Pope, would he?

29:31.630 --> 29:35.150
What evidence do they have
to support these allegations?

29:35.190 --> 29:39.070
Here we go.
The backlash has started.

29:41.870 --> 29:44.100
When the rabbit
of chaos is pursued

29:44.150 --> 29:47.060
by the ferret of disorder
through the fields of anarchy,

29:47.110 --> 29:50.580
it is time to hang your pants
on the hook of darkness.

29:50.630 --> 29:51.620
Yup.

29:51.670 --> 29:53.950
Whether they're clean or not.

29:56.950 --> 29:58.350
London to Milan
Flight SG 1919
6.30am
Why Milan?

29:58.390 --> 30:01.350
London to Milan
Flight SG 1919
6.30am
A TV special.
Screaming kids. The usual.

30:01.390 --> 30:02.980
London to Milan
Flight SG 1919
6.30am
Are we there yet?

30:26.150 --> 30:27.870
What is this?

30:31.470 --> 30:32.660
No way.

30:32.710 --> 30:35.220
Clifford,
what is going on here?

30:36.630 --> 30:38.220
Stop, stop, stop.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.830
Why are you stop-a?

30:39.870 --> 30:42.670
We didn't agree to have
them dancing with us.

30:42.710 --> 30:46.260
You said it was going to be
tacky, but this IS tacky.

30:46.310 --> 30:47.790
Hey, Bobby Charlton.

30:47.830 --> 30:49.580
Why are they stop-a?

30:49.630 --> 30:53.230
They're stopping because
these clowns suddenly appeared.

30:53.270 --> 30:54.990
Molto, molto good dancer.

30:55.030 --> 30:59.580
Sure, but they should be
on another show, or in a zoo.

30:59.630 --> 31:02.620
Look at his muscles. He's got
ferrets burrowing under there.

31:02.670 --> 31:06.660
I know. I'm sorting it out.
Over here.

31:06.710 --> 31:08.670
You think that's real
down there?

31:08.710 --> 31:10.620
Looks like
a pair of rolled-up socks.

31:10.670 --> 31:14.380
You carry on like this,
I take the girls back.

31:14.430 --> 31:18.110
You take the girls back?
What about the contract?

31:18.150 --> 31:19.220
Contract?

31:19.270 --> 31:22.900
In my bed I've got two teddies,
a rabbit and two dollies.

31:22.950 --> 31:24.140
Susan's got a bad eye.

31:24.190 --> 31:28.180
The boys a-stay here.
The girls a-go, I a-sue you.

31:28.230 --> 31:31.510
A.C. Milan? Nah.
You're weak in your midfield.

31:31.550 --> 31:33.380
I've got a green giraffe.

31:33.430 --> 31:35.940
I felt sorry for him.

31:38.310 --> 31:42.430
Then there's Buzz, the alien,
and a fluffy pink water bottle.

31:42.470 --> 31:45.380
So there's not
enough room for you, mate.

31:46.950 --> 31:49.460
- Hey, your mother.
- My mother?

31:49.510 --> 31:51.790
Si. Your mother.

31:51.830 --> 31:54.220
Hey. YOUR mother!

31:54.270 --> 31:56.780
- Mi mama?
- Si, your big fat mother,

31:56.830 --> 31:59.390
and your brother-in-law
and your mad cousin

31:59.430 --> 32:01.580
and your next-door
neighbour's goat!

32:02.670 --> 32:03.740
I kill you.

32:03.790 --> 32:05.190
Go for it!

32:05.230 --> 32:07.060
Boys, boys, boys.

32:07.110 --> 32:08.510
Calm down.

32:08.550 --> 32:10.510
Have you not heard
of "compromisation"?

32:10.550 --> 32:11.670
What?

32:11.710 --> 32:13.430
E pazzo.

32:14.550 --> 32:16.860
Crazy, crazy.

33:15.390 --> 33:18.350
- That looks better.
- We agreed on a compromise.

33:18.390 --> 33:22.460
You'll never believe it

33:22.510 --> 33:25.710
- What on earth's that?
- That's the compromise.

33:28.630 --> 33:30.590
Hey, Bobby Charlton!

33:30.630 --> 33:33.430
Culi bellissimi!

33:45.350 --> 33:47.740
Milan to London
Flight SG 1819
Midnight
Was that really worth it?

33:47.790 --> 33:49.620
Milan to London
Flight SG 1819
Midnight
I'm glad we've got
the morning off.

33:49.670 --> 33:51.470
Milan to London
Flight SG 1819
Midnight
First one in a month.

33:51.510 --> 33:53.390
Milan to London
Flight SG 1819
Midnight
Are we there yet?

33:54.510 --> 33:57.390
- I'm dying for the loo.
- So am I.

33:57.430 --> 33:59.260
Can we stop the bus?

33:59.310 --> 34:01.670
Dennis, pull over.

34:01.710 --> 34:04.940
The girls need to go
to the bathroom...again.

34:08.230 --> 34:10.590
I'm bursting to go wee.

34:12.630 --> 34:14.780
Geri, I borrowed your shoes.

34:14.830 --> 34:16.469
Mind the spiders!

34:18.270 --> 34:21.179
Doesn't matter
how successful you are.

34:21.230 --> 34:23.219
Sometimes you have
to pee in the woods.

34:23.270 --> 34:27.389
How can all the toilets
break down at the same time?

34:27.429 --> 34:28.860
It's not my fault.

34:28.909 --> 34:31.190
It's hard to get a plumber
to your house,

34:31.230 --> 34:33.139
and that stays in one place.

34:33.190 --> 34:36.230
Try calling one
out to a bus. Impossible.

34:36.270 --> 34:38.310
Can't you do
something about them?

34:38.350 --> 34:41.500
- Like what?
- Fix them!

34:41.550 --> 34:47.469
Listen. I love these girls,
and I'll do anything for 'em.

34:48.710 --> 34:50.030
But I won't do that.

34:51.830 --> 34:54.550
Let's not go any further.
I'm scared.

34:54.590 --> 34:57.870
Why is the countryside
so bloody muddy?

34:57.910 --> 35:01.140
Something just brushed past me.

35:01.190 --> 35:04.100
It's only a beast
that wants to eat you.

35:06.310 --> 35:09.300
- Oh, pack it in, Mel.
- It wasn't me.

35:09.350 --> 35:11.710
I think we're lost.

35:13.750 --> 35:15.660
What's that?

35:17.070 --> 35:19.460
Oh, my God, run for it!

35:19.510 --> 35:21.980
I can't move!

35:42.070 --> 35:45.380
It's them! It's them! Look!

35:45.430 --> 35:47.390
Are you sure?

35:47.430 --> 35:50.580
Yes! There's
the little blonde one.

35:50.630 --> 35:52.750
That's what you said before...

35:52.790 --> 35:55.460
..and it was a sheep!

35:59.750 --> 36:01.550
Get off!

36:01.590 --> 36:03.980
I told you - shake hands!

36:04.030 --> 36:05.860
Geri, say something to them.

36:05.910 --> 36:07.820
Say something.

36:07.870 --> 36:10.590
What do you want with us?

36:12.070 --> 36:15.350
Are you the Spice Girls?

36:15.390 --> 36:16.620
Yes.

36:17.470 --> 36:20.220
Can we have tickets
for your Albert Hall gig?

36:20.270 --> 36:23.550
I'm sorry,
but they've all sold out.

36:23.590 --> 36:26.420
I told you
we should've booked early!

36:28.270 --> 36:30.310
What's that?

36:30.350 --> 36:32.630
Can I have your autograph?

36:33.110 --> 36:34.700
It's for my brother.

36:34.750 --> 36:35.870
What's his name?

36:38.190 --> 36:41.710
- Is that 3 or 4 Ks?
- I think that's 4.

36:41.750 --> 36:44.390
Could you sign this,
please, Posh?

36:44.430 --> 36:46.820
Oh, gosh, you're fat.

36:46.870 --> 36:48.940
Give us a kiss, Ginger one!

36:48.990 --> 36:52.110
He wants you to snog him.

36:59.350 --> 37:01.820
Say "khttttyakkk"!

37:02.070 --> 37:03.740
Smile.

37:06.390 --> 37:07.510
What do you mean, aliens?

37:07.550 --> 37:09.060
Aliens from outer space.

37:09.110 --> 37:11.310
They had little squidgy faces.

37:11.350 --> 37:13.390
And cheap green coats.

37:13.430 --> 37:15.470
You're obviously under stress.

37:15.510 --> 37:17.260
You need some time off.

37:17.310 --> 37:20.620
I'm going to stand up
to the chief. Be assertive.

37:20.670 --> 37:22.950
I'll ask him...no, tell him...

37:22.990 --> 37:25.190
the girls'll have
the morning off.

37:26.510 --> 37:28.980
The answer is no, Clifford.

37:29.030 --> 37:30.180
Chief?

37:30.230 --> 37:32.300
The girls cannot have
the morning off.

37:32.350 --> 37:33.620
Of course not, Chief.

37:33.670 --> 37:35.900
The fact that they've
been working hard

37:35.950 --> 37:37.300
and they're exhausted is...

37:37.350 --> 37:39.390
- Irrelevant.
- Irrelevant.

37:39.430 --> 37:42.660
Without sacrifice,
there is no success.

37:42.710 --> 37:45.300
Without pain,
there is no pleasure.

37:45.350 --> 37:48.390
And without something,
there is no nothing.

37:59.630 --> 38:02.990
Very assertive, Clifford.
You'd better go and tell them.

38:03.030 --> 38:05.100
- I know.
- Go on, then.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.820
I'm going on, then.

38:09.550 --> 38:10.740
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

38:10.790 --> 38:13.070
Hold on, hold on.
Where are you going?

38:13.110 --> 38:14.860
We're going home to sleep.

38:14.910 --> 38:17.790
I'm sorry.
There's been a change of plan.

38:17.830 --> 38:21.110
The schedule's too tight.
No morning off.

38:21.150 --> 38:25.140
- Oh, nice one, Clifford.
- You nearly had us there.

38:25.190 --> 38:27.020
You're not good at telling fibs.

38:27.070 --> 38:30.060
I'm sorry.
There's too much to get through.

38:30.110 --> 38:33.230
- You're not joking, are you?
- Oh, no.

38:33.270 --> 38:35.580
We've got to see
Nicola in the morning

38:35.630 --> 38:37.140
'cause the baby's overdue.

38:37.190 --> 38:41.070
Babies are allowed
to be overdue. You're not.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.990
Please.

38:43.030 --> 38:46.150
I'll buy you a milk
chocolate Magnum each.

38:46.190 --> 38:48.750
- OK.
- No.

38:48.790 --> 38:52.500
- You can only push us so far.
- Yeah, right.

38:52.550 --> 38:54.940
You just better watch it, mate.

38:54.990 --> 38:59.220
From now on, there's
no more Mr Nice Spice.

39:04.590 --> 39:06.100
My God.

39:08.550 --> 39:10.980
- What do you think?
- I don't know, mate.

39:11.030 --> 39:13.500
Fooled you!

39:13.550 --> 39:16.020
- Gotcha.
- See you in the morning!

39:16.070 --> 39:18.110
Don't forget my Magnum.

39:18.150 --> 39:20.870
Now hear this.

39:20.910 --> 39:23.420
You are about
to enter dance camp.

39:23.470 --> 39:25.510
You will be
under the instruction

39:25.550 --> 39:28.220
of the toughest
dance teacher ever, Mr Step.

39:28.270 --> 39:29.700
Right, you horrible lot!

39:29.750 --> 39:31.150
Left, right, left.

39:31.190 --> 39:33.390
Whoo. Yaah.

39:33.430 --> 39:35.790
Don't give me
any of that Julie Andrews

39:35.830 --> 39:37.420
high-on-a-hill type claptrap.

39:37.470 --> 39:40.380
I'm your mother now,
and I don't mean superior.

39:40.430 --> 39:43.020
Take that sweet
out of your mouth!

39:45.230 --> 39:48.750
Right, now, shooo-tanoo.

39:48.790 --> 39:49.940
Shimmy, shimmy.

39:49.990 --> 39:51.980
Are you the dance teacher?

39:52.030 --> 39:54.620
That is correct.

39:54.670 --> 39:58.980
I'll show you my pas de bra,
though that won't apply to you.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.700
Pay attention.

40:02.390 --> 40:03.460
One...

40:03.510 --> 40:05.260
Two, one...

40:18.510 --> 40:20.940
- This is ridiculous.
- We can't dance like that.

40:20.990 --> 40:23.420
Yes, I know.
I've seen your videos.

40:24.870 --> 40:27.670
That's enough.
Shall we do our own thing?

40:27.710 --> 40:30.620
Can't even understand them.
They talk so strange.

40:30.670 --> 40:33.630
That's it. We're gonna
get fit, fit, fit.

40:33.670 --> 40:36.060
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4

41:01.270 --> 41:03.860
Attention! Turn right!

41:03.910 --> 41:08.830
3, 4, love it.
Make your mothers proud of you.

41:08.870 --> 41:11.460
What sort of men
are you, anyway?

41:11.510 --> 41:14.260
Left, right, left, right,

41:14.310 --> 41:15.790
left, right, left, right.

41:15.830 --> 41:18.260
Left, right, left, right.

41:20.830 --> 41:25.900
Right, then. Spice Girls,
regimental chant!

42:02.390 --> 42:06.510
Get in there!
Where are you going?

42:06.550 --> 42:08.220
Get out of those tubes!

42:08.270 --> 42:11.150
Up that ramp!
Hold that rope!

42:17.990 --> 42:19.950
That is not correct!

42:19.990 --> 42:21.900
I'll give you not correct.

42:21.950 --> 42:23.750
- No, I...
- Get him!

42:25.950 --> 42:28.780
- Shoo-tanoo...
- I'll give you shoo-tanoo!

42:31.111 --> 42:32.511
Lights out!

42:32.551 --> 42:34.941
It's not even dark yet.

42:34.991 --> 42:36.821
And you, Melanie.

43:52.151 --> 43:56.191
It's pathetic that we can't
even sleep in our own rooms.

43:56.231 --> 43:59.511
What are we making such a fuss?
It's only an old house.

43:59.551 --> 44:01.591
A big old house.

44:01.631 --> 44:05.781
A big, very old,
haunted, big, old house.

44:05.831 --> 44:08.031
I had this horrible
dream last night.

44:08.071 --> 44:11.621
We were doing the live show,
and I went on stage.

44:11.671 --> 44:15.061
I was just about to open my gob,
and nowt came out.

44:15.111 --> 44:16.991
But something
even more weird happened.

44:17.031 --> 44:19.421
- You didn't have a head?
- Yeah. How did you know?

44:19.471 --> 44:22.941
- I had exactly the same dream.
- No way. No.

44:22.991 --> 44:26.381
I had exactly the same dream,
but much worse.

44:26.431 --> 44:29.981
You see, I had a head,
but with no make-up.

44:30.031 --> 44:31.261
Oh, no.

44:31.311 --> 44:34.111
I don't understand.
What does it mean?

44:34.151 --> 44:36.031
Probably our subconscious minds,

44:36.071 --> 44:39.031
so we don't have to deal with
our anxieties when we're awake.

44:39.071 --> 44:41.871
Like we'll be scared
of this live show.

44:41.911 --> 44:44.511
And that we won't
be able to sing.

44:44.551 --> 44:47.271
And it's gonna be
a complete disaster.

44:47.351 --> 44:48.631
Oh, no.

44:48.671 --> 44:50.951
Let's just stay here together.

44:50.991 --> 44:54.031
Squash up.
I'm going to sleep now.

44:56.911 --> 44:58.981
I really hate you, McMaxford!

45:03.391 --> 45:05.191
I hate you!

45:12.231 --> 45:13.631
Look at that!

45:13.671 --> 45:15.581
Look at that! More stories!

45:15.631 --> 45:17.221
More evil harpoons
from the press!

45:17.271 --> 45:19.311
I wouldn't let it bother you.

45:19.351 --> 45:21.341
Chill out.
What's wrong with you?

45:21.391 --> 45:23.191
The press can just flick off.

45:23.231 --> 45:25.671
Makes me want to
strangle something.

45:25.711 --> 45:29.861
If we took any notice of that
press, we'd go mad like you.

45:29.911 --> 45:32.301
"I just can't take any more."

45:32.351 --> 45:35.071
"It's all lies!
I'm not like that!"

45:35.111 --> 45:37.181
"Bring me a straitjacket!"

45:37.231 --> 45:39.791
Yes, you can laugh!

45:45.551 --> 45:48.351
He's so uptight.
He's gonna have a heart attack.

45:48.391 --> 45:51.031
Maybe he's not getting
enough nookie.

45:51.071 --> 45:52.111
Could be.

45:52.151 --> 45:54.541
It would be perfect
if he fancied Deborah.

45:54.591 --> 45:56.101
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:56.151 --> 45:58.381
I reckon he's got
a chance with her.

45:58.431 --> 46:00.631
She hasn't had
a boyfriend in six months.

46:00.671 --> 46:02.151
No. He doesn't fancy her.

46:02.191 --> 46:03.781
He doesn't look at her
when he's talking to her.

46:03.831 --> 46:06.791
That doesn't matter.
You know what men are like.

46:06.831 --> 46:08.581
They don't like showing
their emotions.

46:08.631 --> 46:12.231
There's these animals
in the jungle or rainforest.

46:12.271 --> 46:15.901
When the male is courting
the female, he pees on her.

46:17.111 --> 46:18.621
Geri, do you have to?

46:18.671 --> 46:22.191
It's his way of showing
that he fancies her.

46:22.231 --> 46:24.111
And afterwards they mate.

46:25.671 --> 46:28.581
Call me old-fashioned,
but I prefer flowers.

46:32.271 --> 46:34.831
OK, baby, here's where
we get high-concept.

46:34.871 --> 46:35.941
Eight miles high.

46:35.991 --> 46:38.631
An Air Force
Stealth bomber is hijacked

46:38.671 --> 46:40.501
by extraterrestrial terrorists.

46:40.551 --> 46:43.381
Inside the pilot's pocket
is a computer disk

46:43.431 --> 46:46.261
with a virus encoded on it
that is so deadly,

46:46.311 --> 46:47.871
it could destroy the world.

46:47.911 --> 46:50.741
The prime minister
has no choice.

46:50.791 --> 46:53.591
He has to call in
the Spice Force Five.

46:57.992 --> 47:00.062
Can you see the merchandising?
Action figures?

47:00.112 --> 47:03.102
Crack operatives in their own
field, a martial arts expert...

47:15.232 --> 47:16.632
Counter-espionage agent...

47:24.312 --> 47:25.432
explosives expert...

47:32.432 --> 47:33.502
The master of disguise...

47:47.712 --> 47:51.672
Girl Power.
Equalisation between the sexes.

47:51.712 --> 47:54.552
And...ohh...Victoria.

48:01.432 --> 48:04.902
- Then what? Back to reality?
- Absolutely.

48:04.952 --> 48:07.182
Hey, yeah. Yeah. Why not?

48:08.392 --> 48:14.552
What...kind of reality
are you interested in? I'm open.

48:14.592 --> 48:16.392
Competition winners.

48:16.432 --> 48:20.472
The chance to make those fantasy
figures become a reality.

48:20.512 --> 48:24.662
Dreams come true.
The stuff of fairy tales.

48:24.712 --> 48:28.992
How's it feel to have won
the trip with the Spice Girls?

48:29.032 --> 48:30.262
It's great.

48:30.312 --> 48:32.672
I expect your friends
are really jealous.

48:32.712 --> 48:34.752
- Yes.
- I'm sure they are.

48:34.792 --> 48:35.752
I love you, Victoria!

48:35.792 --> 48:36.992
How's that sound? A bit noisy?

48:37.032 --> 48:38.832
Planes, dogs, traffic.

48:38.872 --> 48:42.392
We won't be using
this bit anyway. Come on.

48:42.432 --> 48:45.192
I hate that. Can't get
a word in edgewise.

48:45.232 --> 48:47.542
They treat us like bloody kids.

48:47.592 --> 48:49.982
Welcome to the Spicebus.

48:50.032 --> 48:51.782
Cool.

48:51.832 --> 48:53.152
Girls, competition winners.

48:53.192 --> 48:54.262
- Hello!
- Hello!

48:54.352 --> 48:56.822
Balloons, cakes,
sandwiches. Fun, fun.

48:56.872 --> 48:58.592
Do you want a Polaroid?

48:58.632 --> 49:02.392
Jack and Evie, isn't it?
Do you want something to eat?

49:02.432 --> 49:05.032
Why are there
fish paste sarnies at parties?

49:05.072 --> 49:07.432
- No one likes them.
- I know.

49:07.472 --> 49:09.942
Must be great
being a Spice Girl.

49:09.992 --> 49:11.192
It's really good. Yeah.

49:11.232 --> 49:14.142
Be even better without
our fascist slave driver

49:14.192 --> 49:15.912
bossing us about!

49:17.112 --> 49:19.422
Let's escape from this place!

49:19.472 --> 49:22.032
Don't worry.
She does this all the time.

49:22.072 --> 49:26.152
She is mad.

49:26.192 --> 49:29.422
When I say "Go," we go.

49:30.872 --> 49:33.072
- Go!
- Grab some crisps!

49:33.112 --> 49:34.862
- Let's go!
- Where are we going?

49:34.912 --> 49:36.472
Just go with the flow!

49:36.512 --> 49:37.912
Take it easy, girls.

49:37.952 --> 49:40.632
- Where are they going?
- They're being spontaneous.

49:40.672 --> 49:43.582
If they want to be spontaneous,

49:43.632 --> 49:45.912
they have to clear it
with me first.

49:47.712 --> 49:49.032
Come on. Let's go!

49:49.072 --> 49:51.352
Can we have a ride on your boat?

49:51.392 --> 49:54.272
There's an aquatic
adventure happening here.

49:55.792 --> 49:58.782
We need a really
serious speedboat.

49:58.832 --> 50:01.982
- Dennis, follow them!
- I'm on a trail, Clifford.

50:18.072 --> 50:19.552
The Spice Girls at sea.

50:19.592 --> 50:21.342
What an extraordinary
combination

50:21.392 --> 50:24.072
of Girl Power and horsepower.

50:24.112 --> 50:26.342
Can't this thing go any faster?

50:28.632 --> 50:30.672
Avanti!

50:43.672 --> 50:47.352
Deborah, can you please explain
what the hell is going on here?

50:47.392 --> 50:50.542
They're just having fun.
You know, rock 'n' roll.

50:50.592 --> 50:53.192
Rock 'n' roll is
getting off your face

50:53.232 --> 50:56.862
and throwing TVs out of windows.
I don't remember boats.

50:59.312 --> 51:02.272
They're dancing.
Can we have them dancing?

51:02.312 --> 51:03.432
I hear singing.

51:03.472 --> 51:06.032
Can you get
what they're singing?

51:06.072 --> 51:08.382
Don't you remember being a kid?

51:08.432 --> 51:09.632
What?

51:09.672 --> 51:12.792
Falling over in the playground,
scraping your knees.

51:12.832 --> 51:15.352
Deborah, what planet
are you from?

51:16.952 --> 51:18.102
Hold on!

51:18.152 --> 51:19.792
Water on the lens.

51:24.432 --> 51:25.632
Here they come.

51:29.632 --> 51:30.622
Stop!

51:32.952 --> 51:35.102
Stop!

51:38.752 --> 51:40.342
Oh, my...

51:40.392 --> 51:44.182
A child in the water!
I want a close-up!

51:44.232 --> 51:46.512
- All I get is you shouting.
- Shush, then!

51:46.552 --> 51:48.512
Turn it round! Quick!

51:48.552 --> 51:50.832
Don't worry! I'll save them!

51:52.912 --> 51:54.952
At last, a real drama!
Oof! Sorry!

51:54.992 --> 51:57.142
Get off! I'm filming.

51:58.752 --> 52:00.902
I got a loud splash, Piers.

52:02.392 --> 52:03.592
Just great!

52:03.632 --> 52:06.912
Parents lend us their kids,
and we drown them!

52:06.952 --> 52:09.672
- Wow, that was brilliant!
- Yeah, wicked!

52:09.712 --> 52:11.702
That was not
supposed to happen!

52:11.752 --> 52:13.582
- You OK?
- We're fine.

52:13.632 --> 52:16.672
You mean I got wet for nothing?

52:16.712 --> 52:18.432
- Help!
- What?

52:18.472 --> 52:20.912
This dress is
dryclean only, Melanie!

52:20.952 --> 52:23.392
Are there sharks in the Thames?

52:23.432 --> 52:24.342
Shut up.

52:24.392 --> 52:25.592
They're coming!

52:28.872 --> 52:30.912
Whose idea was this?

52:30.952 --> 52:32.472
- Yours.
- Yours.

52:32.512 --> 52:34.342
Can we do it again?

52:37.632 --> 52:40.472
- Do you want to wear this?
- I'm not that desperate.

52:41.712 --> 52:44.912
- Easy! Easy!
- Are you all right?

52:47.912 --> 52:51.352
Do you realise what'll happen
if this gets out?

53:09.392 --> 53:12.192
And more drama concerning
the Spice Girls.

53:12.232 --> 53:14.432
Today, two young
competition winners

53:14.472 --> 53:16.272
had a dramatic escape
when they fell

53:16.312 --> 53:18.462
from a speeding boat
on the River Thames.

53:18.512 --> 53:20.502
This report from James Platt.

53:20.552 --> 53:23.152
Would you like a rescue remedy?

53:23.192 --> 53:25.152
It's time for a chat.

53:31.592 --> 53:33.032
Look at this!

53:33.072 --> 53:34.952
Front page news again.

53:34.992 --> 53:37.062
Suppose you had been drowned?

53:37.112 --> 53:39.552
- We weren't.
- Speak for yourself.

53:39.592 --> 53:41.232
What do you think you're doing?

53:41.272 --> 53:43.992
- We were just having fun.
- What?

53:44.032 --> 53:46.992
You know, fun,
like ha-ha-ha-ha-ha?

53:47.032 --> 53:50.552
We're old enough to be
responsible for our own lives.

53:50.592 --> 53:53.192
You don't have a life.
You have a schedule.

53:53.232 --> 53:56.032
You are part of
a well-oiled global machine.

53:56.072 --> 53:58.112
People are working
their butts off for you.

53:58.152 --> 54:00.592
- People like Deborah.
- Leave my butt out of this.

54:00.632 --> 54:03.022
Just don't be so
uptight, Clifford.

54:03.072 --> 54:06.382
Uptight?! You've got
a live gig here tomorrow.

54:06.432 --> 54:10.982
It's my job to see you turn up.
My bum is on the line!

54:11.032 --> 54:15.262
Could you please leave butts
and bums out of this?

54:15.312 --> 54:17.752
Some things are more
important than gigs.

54:17.792 --> 54:21.752
- Like what?
- Self-respect and our freedom.

54:21.792 --> 54:23.382
And friendship.

54:23.432 --> 54:26.422
What are you saying? You
don't want to turn up tomorrow?

54:26.472 --> 54:27.672
Maybe we don't!

54:29.592 --> 54:32.352
- Why did you say that?
- I don't know.

54:32.392 --> 54:37.862
Listen, it's up to us whether
we turn up or not tomorrow.

54:37.912 --> 54:39.822
OK. Stay at home.

54:39.872 --> 54:41.542
That's fine.

54:41.592 --> 54:43.582
- Fine!
- What about the fans?

54:43.632 --> 54:46.022
- We can't let them down!
- He didn't mean that.

54:46.072 --> 54:47.872
Didn't I?

54:47.912 --> 54:49.432
Please stop arguing!

54:49.472 --> 54:52.512
When you know exactly
what is happening,

54:52.552 --> 54:55.542
could somebody
please let me know?

54:55.592 --> 55:00.712
- Now look what you've done!
- That's just too bad.

55:00.752 --> 55:02.552
Yeah, 'cause you know what?

55:02.592 --> 55:05.472
- I'm going home now. See ya.
- Bye.

55:05.512 --> 55:08.582
Could we just stop this?
It's doing my head in!

55:12.792 --> 55:14.862
I hope you know
what you're doing!

55:14.912 --> 55:17.552
If you want a fight,
you're gonna lose.

55:19.072 --> 55:22.862
So, what do you think?
No, I don't want to hear it.

55:22.912 --> 55:24.192
What do you think?

55:24.232 --> 55:27.072
I think you definitely,
definitely lost.

55:27.112 --> 55:28.912
I think...

55:28.952 --> 55:32.952
I may have started
the break-up of the Spice Girls.

55:44.032 --> 55:46.232
It's fine, Chief.
Everything's fine.

55:46.272 --> 55:48.912
- Oh, no, it isn't.
- No, it isn't.

55:48.952 --> 55:50.672
How bad is it?

55:50.712 --> 55:53.312
Imagine how bad
it could possibly be.

55:53.352 --> 55:56.262
- Yes?
- Well, it's worse than that.

55:56.312 --> 55:58.462
- Oh, dear.
- Don't get upset, Chief.

55:58.512 --> 56:01.982
- Oh, dearie me.
- You're getting emotional.

56:02.032 --> 56:07.662
The show will go on, even if
I have to round up four friends

56:07.712 --> 56:10.102
and personally dress up
as Victoria.

56:10.152 --> 56:15.072
- May it not come to that.
- I won't let you down.

56:15.112 --> 56:18.792
The headless chicken
can only know where he's been.

56:18.832 --> 56:21.742
He cannot see
where he is going.

56:23.512 --> 56:26.472
Do not be that chicken,
Clifford.

56:28.512 --> 56:30.262
Chicken. Right.

56:34.152 --> 56:37.992
The girls have had a row
with Clifford.

56:38.032 --> 56:41.822
They might not turn up
for the show.

56:41.872 --> 56:44.312
Something strange is happening.

56:46.192 --> 56:48.582
What is it?

56:48.632 --> 56:51.432
Something's happening
to my face.

56:51.472 --> 56:53.622
I...I think you're smiling.

57:20.752 --> 57:24.272
A very long time ago.

57:27.032 --> 57:28.832
Thanks, Brian.

57:28.872 --> 57:34.872
There we go, girls.
That's six coffees. £1.50.

57:34.912 --> 57:37.902
- Put in on the slate, please.
- What slate?

57:37.952 --> 57:40.152
The we'll-pay-you-
when-we're-rich slate.

57:40.192 --> 57:43.032
Call me old-fashioned, but...no.

57:43.072 --> 57:47.272
- I'm not the Salvation Army?
- It was worth a try.

57:47.312 --> 57:49.992
How's the career going?

57:50.032 --> 57:52.792
We've got this new song.

57:52.832 --> 57:57.142
What is it?
Flip-flop or hip-hop? Funk?

57:57.192 --> 58:00.182
Where've you been
for the last 10 years?

58:00.232 --> 58:03.462
Well, I don't know
the music scene now.

58:03.512 --> 58:06.112
Anything goes these days.

58:06.152 --> 58:10.512
I'm a jazz man,
and jazz is due for a comeback.

58:10.552 --> 58:14.152
They've got this great song.
Do it for him.

58:14.192 --> 58:17.952
- Nah. He's not interested.
- 'Course he is! Aren't you?

58:17.992 --> 58:21.592
Yes, you are.
Sit down and listen.

58:21.632 --> 59:57.072
Let's do it!

59:57.112 --> 59:58.702
What do you think?

59:58.752 --> 01:00:01.982
Not bad.
Just needs a bit more jazz.

01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:03.352
Wicked!

01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:06.112
- It'll make the top 20!
- Wicked!

01:00:06.152 --> 01:00:09.752
It's great! I love it!

01:00:25.232 --> 01:00:27.952
- It's so sad.
- That's what I was thinking.

01:00:27.992 --> 01:00:30.222
We used to live in there.

01:00:33.072 --> 01:00:35.512
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

01:00:35.552 --> 01:00:37.782
Same as you.

01:00:37.832 --> 01:00:41.272
This seems like
ages ago, doesn't it?

01:00:41.312 --> 01:00:44.752
It just shows you.
You can't go back.

01:00:44.792 --> 01:00:46.462
I wonder
what happened to Brian.

01:00:46.512 --> 01:00:49.902
We owe him
for a couple of coffees.

01:00:49.952 --> 01:00:51.782
Let's go get some chips.

01:00:52.952 --> 01:00:55.022
Bacon butties for me.

01:00:55.072 --> 01:00:57.112
You don't care what you eat.

01:00:57.152 --> 01:00:58.822
No, I don't.

01:00:58.872 --> 01:01:02.952
I wonder if we've changed
since we've been famous?

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:05.062
I don't think I have.

01:01:05.112 --> 01:01:06.552
Nor have I.

01:01:06.592 --> 01:01:08.422
We worry about different things.

01:01:08.472 --> 01:01:11.592
Then it was, "Where's
our next meal coming from?"

01:01:11.632 --> 01:01:15.592
Now it's, "Where's
our next single going to?"

01:01:15.632 --> 01:01:17.832
And, "Is it over soon?"

01:01:18.792 --> 01:01:21.942
Melvin B, Emma, Melvin C,

01:01:21.992 --> 01:01:24.902
Victoria, Geri...

01:01:24.952 --> 01:01:27.472
You are guilty
of releasing a single

01:01:27.512 --> 01:01:30.982
that is not as kicking
as your previous records,

01:01:31.032 --> 01:01:34.912
nor does it have
such a wicked bass line.

01:01:34.952 --> 01:01:37.942
You are sentenced
to having your next record

01:01:37.992 --> 01:01:40.382
enter the charts at number 179

01:01:40.432 --> 01:01:42.712
before dropping
out the following week.

01:01:42.752 --> 01:01:44.312
What?

01:01:44.352 --> 01:01:47.342
Furthermore,
you are sentenced to 20 years

01:01:47.392 --> 01:01:51.072
of having to appear
on chat shows in Taiwan

01:01:51.112 --> 01:01:54.072
talking about how
you used to be famous.

01:01:54.112 --> 01:01:58.342
May God have mercy
on your lip gloss.

01:01:59.792 --> 01:02:01.992
Call Gary Barlow.

01:02:02.032 --> 01:02:04.992
We haven't got time
for our friends anymore.

01:02:05.032 --> 01:02:06.942
Like Nicola.

01:02:06.992 --> 01:02:09.712
We're supposed to be
godmothers to her baby.

01:02:09.752 --> 01:02:11.742
We haven't spent
any time with her.

01:02:11.792 --> 01:02:13.672
Why don't we
take her out tonight?

01:02:13.712 --> 01:02:15.992
Yeah! And go really mental!

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:17.352
Yeah!

01:02:17.392 --> 01:02:21.392
We have a show tomorrow.
What are we doing about that?

01:02:21.432 --> 01:02:24.662
If Clifford finds out
he'll go beserk.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:30.822
What are we waiting for?

01:02:30.872 --> 01:02:33.672
- Yeah!
- Come on!

01:02:33.712 --> 01:02:38.792
- Come on, Vicky!
- I can't run in these heels.

01:02:49.392 --> 01:02:51.782
Thought I'd find you here.

01:02:51.832 --> 01:02:55.712
Sorry, there's only room for
one depressed personality here.

01:02:55.752 --> 01:02:58.392
At least you're still alive.

01:02:58.432 --> 01:03:00.792
That's the bit
that depresses me.

01:03:00.832 --> 01:03:04.792
I've got a degree in politics,
philosophy, and economics,

01:03:04.832 --> 01:03:08.112
and I spend my life
worrying whether Mel C

01:03:08.152 --> 01:03:10.622
is wearing
the right Nike Air Max.

01:03:10.672 --> 01:03:14.032
- Did you sort them out?
- Yes.

01:03:15.432 --> 01:03:19.712
Mind you, I'd rather be us
than the girls. Fame is...

01:03:19.752 --> 01:03:21.872
Fame is a fickle thing.

01:03:22.472 --> 01:03:23.992
What can I get you?

01:03:24.032 --> 01:03:25.552
Gin and tonic, please.

01:03:27.832 --> 01:03:31.832
Just a minute.
Can you make that a double?

01:03:31.872 --> 01:03:32.992
Yes.

01:03:34.672 --> 01:03:37.872
- You know what happens now?
- What's that?

01:03:37.912 --> 01:03:40.382
We'll sit here
and get self-pitying,

01:03:40.432 --> 01:03:43.192
telling each other
tales of lost lovers,

01:03:43.232 --> 01:03:46.672
then deaden the pain
with a night of passion

01:03:46.712 --> 01:03:50.182
and end up ruining
our professional relationship.

01:03:52.432 --> 01:03:56.062
Well, I'm up for it if you are.

01:03:57.832 --> 01:04:00.062
Time, ladies and gentlemen.

01:04:09.352 --> 01:04:10.912
I hope Bob's here!

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:18.032
You all right, Nicola?

01:04:18.072 --> 01:04:20.712
Fine. I won't be
going out for a while,

01:04:20.752 --> 01:04:22.952
so I'm going to enjoy it.

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:26.222
- I love this song!
- That's because we wrote it!

01:04:26.272 --> 01:04:29.792
- Let's go and dance.
- No, I'll watch you.

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:31.312
Take care, Nicola.

01:04:31.352 --> 01:04:32.312
See you later.

01:04:40.352 --> 01:04:44.502
Could somebody please tell me
what the dress code is here?

01:06:08.192 --> 01:06:11.182
- Excuse me!
- Excuse me! Sorry.

01:06:11.232 --> 01:06:14.112
Can we sit down, please?

01:06:14.152 --> 01:06:16.432
I think the contractions
have started.

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:17.702
Maybe it's something you ate.

01:06:17.752 --> 01:06:19.982
I don't remember
swallowing a baby.

01:06:20.032 --> 01:06:22.182
The baby's coming. Don't panic.

01:06:22.232 --> 01:06:24.952
- Don't panic.
- I'm not panicking.

01:06:24.992 --> 01:06:27.062
What do you do
in an emergency?

01:06:27.112 --> 01:06:29.752
- Call my mum!
- We need an ambulance!

01:06:29.792 --> 01:06:32.632
- There's not enough time.
- We don't need an ambulance!

01:06:32.672 --> 01:06:35.712
Dennis! We've got
to get to the hospital!

01:06:38.272 --> 01:06:40.832
- All of you?
- Just get there!

01:06:40.872 --> 01:06:44.072
Move 'em in.
We're gonna hit the trail.

01:06:47.512 --> 01:06:50.152
- Ooh, that was a contraction.
- Cuddle.

01:06:50.192 --> 01:06:52.342
Deep breathing.
That's the thing.

01:06:54.792 --> 01:06:56.622
Not you, Victoria. Her!

01:06:56.672 --> 01:06:58.952
Does anybody know
how to deliver a baby?

01:06:58.992 --> 01:07:01.872
- Don't look at me!
- I know all about delivery.

01:07:01.912 --> 01:07:04.472
- Yeah, right.
- I read it in a book.

01:07:04.512 --> 01:07:07.312
First...put your legs together.

01:07:07.352 --> 01:07:09.822
She should have
done that 9 months ago.

01:07:09.872 --> 01:07:12.912
- Don't make me laugh, please.
- Do not make her laugh,

01:07:12.952 --> 01:07:14.992
it'll shoot out
like a cannonball.

01:07:15.032 --> 01:07:18.872
Seriously, what if
the baby comes out right now?

01:07:18.912 --> 01:07:22.112
It's not gonna go far.
She's still got her tights on.

01:07:22.152 --> 01:07:24.432
Stay there.
We're not ready for you.

01:07:28.112 --> 01:07:31.152
- That's it! Push!
- I am pushing!

01:07:31.192 --> 01:07:33.872
- Should she be pushing?
- What else can she do?

01:07:33.912 --> 01:07:35.662
I'll turn myself inside out!

01:07:35.712 --> 01:07:37.862
- What's going on?
- She's pushing!

01:07:37.912 --> 01:07:39.792
How dilated is she?

01:07:39.832 --> 01:07:42.192
Not very. She only had one gin.

01:07:42.232 --> 01:07:46.152
Calm down. This is going
to take a long time.

01:07:48.152 --> 01:07:49.632
Oh, that's nice.

01:07:49.672 --> 01:07:51.632
It's all right. We're here.

01:07:57.232 --> 01:07:59.382
That's catchy.

01:08:00.352 --> 01:08:02.912
Excuse me?
Are you the Spice Girls?

01:08:02.952 --> 01:08:04.432
Some of them.

01:08:04.472 --> 01:08:06.382
My son's unconscious.

01:08:06.432 --> 01:08:09.392
Could you talk to him,
try and wake him up?

01:08:09.432 --> 01:08:12.232
- We can do that, can't we?
- Sorry about this.

01:08:17.392 --> 01:08:21.022
Malcolm, the Spice Girls
have come to talk to you!

01:08:21.072 --> 01:08:24.832
- Hello, Malcolm. It's Geri.
- And Melanie C.

01:08:24.872 --> 01:08:27.261
And I'm Victoria, Malcolm!

01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:29.032
Shh. Stop it.

01:08:29.072 --> 01:08:31.631
What should we do now?

01:08:31.671 --> 01:08:35.712
- Maybe just talk to him.
- What are we gonna say?

01:08:35.752 --> 01:08:37.982
You could take
your top off, Geri.

01:08:38.032 --> 01:08:41.952
- Shut up!
- Just a joke.

01:08:41.992 --> 01:08:44.671
Anyway, he's got his eyes shut.

01:08:45.752 --> 01:08:46.822
Not now.

01:08:59.631 --> 01:09:02.912
- How are you feeling?
- Bad. Where are the girls?

01:09:02.952 --> 01:09:06.421
I don't know. I have no idea.

01:09:08.631 --> 01:09:10.992
How about trying to find out?

01:09:11.032 --> 01:09:14.341
Come on. Chop-chop. Hurry it up.

01:09:14.392 --> 01:09:17.352
Amazing how much pain
mothers have to suffer.

01:09:17.392 --> 01:09:20.432
No wonder my mum thinks
I'm so ungrateful.

01:09:20.471 --> 01:09:22.752
It's like passing a football.

01:09:22.792 --> 01:09:27.551
My mum says it was like passing
a block of flats with balconies.

01:09:28.712 --> 01:09:32.862
Hello? Hi, Deborah.
We're in hospital.

01:09:32.912 --> 01:09:35.792
No, we're fine.
Nicola's having a baby.

01:09:35.832 --> 01:09:37.232
We can't leave her.

01:09:38.312 --> 01:09:40.782
Oh, no. I've got to go. Bye.

01:09:40.832 --> 01:09:46.381
I can't believe it. They're
waiting for a friend's baby?

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:49.582
- It's called loyalty.
- No, it's called insanity.

01:09:49.631 --> 01:09:54.312
The world is waiting for this
show and they're not here.

01:09:54.352 --> 01:09:58.552
They're doing it to spite me.
They're trying to make me crack.

01:09:58.632 --> 01:10:00.432
But I won't.

01:10:02.312 --> 01:10:03.832
I won't.

01:10:03.872 --> 01:10:08.822
I spy with my bionic eye
something beginning with "H".

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:10.272
Hospital.

01:10:10.312 --> 01:10:13.222
Shut up, Geri.

01:10:13.272 --> 01:10:16.032
I'm off-duty now.
Everything all right?

01:10:16.072 --> 01:10:18.032
Fine. Doing anything
nice tonight?

01:10:18.072 --> 01:10:20.712
I'm going to see
the Spice Girls' show.

01:10:20.752 --> 01:10:22.312
I'd better get a move on.

01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:25.032
See you all later...
hopefully.

01:10:28.392 --> 01:10:32.752
Listen, this is silly.
Don't wait for me. Go.

01:10:32.792 --> 01:10:36.422
Nicola, we said we'd stay,
so we're gonna stay.

01:10:38.112 --> 01:10:40.152
- I think this is it.
- Yeah, it is.

01:10:41.632 --> 01:10:45.022
Push down, Nicola. Very good.

01:10:45.072 --> 01:10:48.302
Hi, Clifford. No, I don't
know when we'll be there.

01:10:48.352 --> 01:10:51.582
This is more important.
It's about friendship.

01:10:51.632 --> 01:10:53.542
But you wouldn't
know about that.

01:10:53.592 --> 01:10:55.902
I'll speak to you later. Bye.

01:10:55.952 --> 01:11:01.072
It can't take THIS long to have
a baby! This is the nineties!

01:11:01.112 --> 01:11:03.912
He's about to
crack up any moment.

01:11:03.952 --> 01:11:06.392
The sense of tension,
of impending doom.

01:11:06.432 --> 01:11:09.712
Are you getting that sweat
on his upper lip?

01:11:09.752 --> 01:11:11.272
That's beautiful.

01:11:12.992 --> 01:11:15.672
Clifford,
have you got 5 minutes?

01:11:15.712 --> 01:11:18.072
Seeing as there's nothing
else going around here - 5!

01:11:18.112 --> 01:11:20.632
Graydon, fetch!

01:11:20.672 --> 01:11:22.232
OK, here's the story!

01:11:22.272 --> 01:11:24.072
It's the girls'
first live performance.

01:11:24.112 --> 01:11:25.672
They are...

01:11:25.712 --> 01:11:27.752
Only minutes until curtain up.

01:11:27.792 --> 01:11:30.912
Hopes of the Spice Girls'
live triumph are dashed.

01:11:30.952 --> 01:11:34.342
My God! It's coming out!
I think I'm gonna faint.

01:11:34.392 --> 01:11:37.352
- No, you're not!
- Slap me! Oh!

01:11:39.632 --> 01:11:42.752
- It's a beet root!
- It's a girl!

01:11:42.792 --> 01:11:47.912
With arms like that,
she'll make a great goalie.

01:11:47.952 --> 01:11:51.022
Now, that is Girl Power.

01:12:03.192 --> 01:12:04.752
He's got a camera!

01:12:04.792 --> 01:12:06.592
You're that reporter,
aren't you?

01:12:06.632 --> 01:12:08.672
- Emergency!
- Get him, Melanie!

01:12:08.712 --> 01:12:12.792
I'm late for the theatre!
The curtain's gone up!

01:12:15.712 --> 01:12:17.302
He crashes to the ground!

01:12:17.352 --> 01:12:22.142
Now the girls come face to face
with their tabloid tormentor.

01:12:22.192 --> 01:12:24.342
The evil reporter is unmasked,

01:12:24.392 --> 01:12:28.392
and Damien's whole worthless
life flashes before his eyes.

01:12:28.432 --> 01:12:32.472
The girls have made him realise
that he's been living a lie.

01:12:32.512 --> 01:12:34.422
Do you know what?

01:12:34.472 --> 01:12:39.342
You've made me realize I've
been living a meaningless lie.

01:12:39.392 --> 01:12:41.382
It's his character's
one defining moment.

01:12:41.432 --> 01:12:44.312
There isn't a dry seat
in the house.

01:12:44.352 --> 01:12:47.422
- I'm wet already.
- I don't buy it.

01:12:47.472 --> 01:12:49.832
One minute, Damien's
this threatening monster,

01:12:49.872 --> 01:12:51.942
the next, some weeping wimp.

01:12:51.992 --> 01:12:54.352
That's the power of Girl Power.

01:12:54.392 --> 01:12:55.752
- That's the end?
- No.

01:12:55.792 --> 01:12:58.942
Damien goes after
the evil boss, McMaxford.

01:12:59.512 --> 01:13:01.662
"McMaxford sacked
in jacuzzi scandal."

01:13:01.712 --> 01:13:04.352
- What about the girls?
- They must get to Albert Hall.

01:13:04.392 --> 01:13:06.272
They've been at
the hospital for 12 hours.

01:13:07.512 --> 01:13:10.582
I don't believe it!
Just when you need him!

01:13:10.632 --> 01:13:12.992
Now it's a race against time.

01:13:13.032 --> 01:13:15.152
- A chase?
- Those are the rules.

01:13:15.192 --> 01:13:18.182
- Out of the way, girls.
- What are you doing?

01:13:18.232 --> 01:13:19.952
Fasten your seat belts!

01:13:23.392 --> 01:13:25.512
Hey! That's my bus!

01:13:26.712 --> 01:13:28.542
What are you doing?!

01:13:28.592 --> 01:13:30.182
Out of the way!

01:13:32.752 --> 01:13:35.062
Come on! What are you doing?

01:13:35.112 --> 01:13:36.512
Are you blind?

01:13:36.552 --> 01:13:38.912
Put your foot down!

01:13:41.112 --> 01:13:43.912
Sunday drivers!
It's only Saturday!

01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:46.862
The Spicebus
is racing across London,

01:13:46.912 --> 01:13:49.222
through Trafalgar square,
pigeons are flying up,

01:13:49.272 --> 01:13:51.022
guys are diving into fountains.

01:13:51.072 --> 01:13:54.302
As it zooms down the mall
past Buckingham palace,

01:13:54.352 --> 01:13:56.232
Prince William's
looking out a curtain.

01:13:56.272 --> 01:13:59.312
He turns to the queen -
the queen, man! - and says,

01:13:59.352 --> 01:14:02.192
"Granny, look!
It's the Spice Girls!

01:14:02.232 --> 01:14:05.542
"They're on telly in a minute!

01:14:05.592 --> 01:14:07.262
"Isn't that
the posh one driving?"

01:14:07.312 --> 01:14:08.542
There's the queen!

01:14:08.592 --> 01:14:11.032
- Hi, William!
- Hi, Charlie!

01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:12.662
Suddenly they're
on top of the bus!

01:14:12.712 --> 01:14:13.912
- Why?
- The rules.

01:14:13.952 --> 01:14:17.832
There they are,
standing in gale force winds,

01:14:17.872 --> 01:14:20.102
holding on for dear life!

01:14:20.152 --> 01:14:22.062
Emma slips, but Geri grabs her!

01:14:22.112 --> 01:14:24.262
Then Geri slips,
so Mel B grabs her.

01:14:24.312 --> 01:14:26.512
Then she slips
so Mel C grabs her!

01:14:26.552 --> 01:14:28.992
Is that 4?
Oh, there's one driving.

01:14:29.032 --> 01:14:32.152
They're on the bus,
whiplashing back and forth,

01:14:32.192 --> 01:14:34.502
about to be turned
into Spice Jam!

01:14:34.552 --> 01:14:36.942
- Oh, my God!
- And?

01:14:36.992 --> 01:14:40.512
Two nuns pull up right in front!

01:14:41.832 --> 01:14:44.712
The braking tumbles
them back inside.

01:14:46.672 --> 01:14:48.072
That was close.

01:14:48.112 --> 01:14:50.832
- Is everyone all right?
- Victoria!

01:14:50.872 --> 01:14:52.622
Sorry!

01:14:52.672 --> 01:14:54.192
They're on the Tower Bridge.

01:14:54.232 --> 01:14:56.832
Your attention, please.

01:14:56.872 --> 01:14:58.462
The bridge will be lifted.

01:14:58.512 --> 01:15:01.662
The road is rising
to let a boat through!

01:15:04.592 --> 01:15:06.032
The bridge is going up!

01:15:06.072 --> 01:15:07.592
They can't believe it!

01:15:07.632 --> 01:15:10.102
My God, I don't believe it!

01:15:10.152 --> 01:15:13.222
Are they crazy enough
to jump the gap?

01:15:16.352 --> 01:15:18.712
Hold on to your knickers, girls!

01:15:18.752 --> 01:15:22.222
Hey, baby, these
are the Spice Girls!

01:15:22.272 --> 01:15:23.792
Of course they're
gonna go for it!

01:15:23.832 --> 01:15:26.792
Up it goes...
a 5-ton London bus

01:15:26.832 --> 01:15:29.062
sailing through the air
at 70 mph!

01:15:29.112 --> 01:15:31.152
- It's incredible!
- It's expensive.

01:15:36.192 --> 01:15:37.262
Not necessarily.

01:15:39.232 --> 01:15:41.912
Just when you think they're
safe, they discover the bomb.

01:15:41.952 --> 01:15:42.912
What bomb?

01:15:45.312 --> 01:15:45.982
That bomb.

01:15:50.352 --> 01:15:52.792
- Why?!
- Those are the rules.

01:15:52.832 --> 01:15:54.472
I've had enough
of the rules!

01:15:54.512 --> 01:15:56.742
Are you trying
to kill them?! No more!

01:15:56.792 --> 01:15:58.622
They've suffered enough! Please!

01:15:58.672 --> 01:16:00.632
All right! All right!

01:16:00.672 --> 01:16:03.192
They run up to the Albert Hall,

01:16:03.232 --> 01:16:05.192
then they hurtle
down the corridor,

01:16:05.232 --> 01:16:07.872
and they burst through
that door right there.

01:16:12.512 --> 01:16:14.422
You lied to me.

01:16:14.472 --> 01:16:16.432
Now, now, hey, now.

01:16:16.472 --> 01:16:18.672
Hey, that's enough of that!

01:16:18.712 --> 01:16:19.862
Where are they?

01:16:20.032 --> 01:16:28.352
I'll re-write it.

01:16:28.392 --> 01:16:32.672
- Quick, we're late!
- Clifford's gonna go mad!

01:16:44.872 --> 01:16:46.072
It's the coppers!

01:16:47.952 --> 01:16:49.832
Stay calm, it'll be all right.

01:16:52.552 --> 01:16:55.752
Is there a problem...Officer?

01:16:55.792 --> 01:16:58.102
Dangerous driving,
criminal damage,

01:16:58.152 --> 01:17:01.992
flying a bus without a license,

01:17:02.032 --> 01:17:03.832
and frightening the pigeons.

01:17:06.552 --> 01:17:10.102
- Go on, Emma. Go.
- What do I say?

01:17:10.152 --> 01:17:11.952
I'm really sorry, Officer.

01:17:11.992 --> 01:17:13.662
We were late for a show,

01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:15.272
so we were in a hurry.
We didn't hurt anybody.

01:17:15.312 --> 01:17:19.312
We're sorry and promise
never, ever to do that again.

01:17:27.432 --> 01:17:29.552
- Should we cut?
- No, no!

01:17:29.592 --> 01:17:31.262
What's the matter with him?

01:17:31.312 --> 01:17:34.272
The very essence
of documentary - silence.

01:17:34.312 --> 01:17:36.912
Silence. This is marvellous.

01:17:41.752 --> 01:17:44.712
This is the plan.
The band starts up,

01:17:44.752 --> 01:17:48.222
the fans go wild,
the lights come on,

01:17:48.272 --> 01:17:51.632
and I walk centre stage
and hang myself.

01:17:52.672 --> 01:17:55.232
By the way,
this is my good side.

01:17:55.272 --> 01:17:58.072
My final words are...

01:17:58.112 --> 01:18:00.582
"The Spice Girls -
I hate them!"

01:18:00.632 --> 01:18:02.782
What are you doing
sitting around?

01:18:02.832 --> 01:18:04.902
- We've got a show to do!
- Let's do it!

01:18:04.952 --> 01:18:07.592
- Where are the mikes?
- Where are the clothes?

01:18:07.632 --> 01:18:10.622
- Where are the bacon butties?
- I love those girls.

01:18:10.672 --> 01:18:11.822
Hiya.

01:18:11.872 --> 01:18:14.392
I love those girls!

01:18:14.432 --> 01:18:17.422
- Damn.
- My arm...

01:18:21.232 --> 01:18:25.232
That's ruined a perfectly good
ending to this documentary.

01:18:27.992 --> 01:18:29.312
Everything's
under control, Chief.

01:18:29.352 --> 01:18:32.742
Then let us enjoy this
triumph while we can,

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:36.152
before the hounds of catastrophe
break free of their shackles

01:18:36.192 --> 01:18:39.742
and slobber chaos all over
our faces once again.

01:18:39.792 --> 01:18:41.022
Ciao, Chief.

01:18:41.072 --> 01:18:44.062
- What did he say?
- Does it matter?

01:18:44.112 --> 01:18:45.992
When you've
been horrible to someone,

01:18:46.032 --> 01:18:48.022
and you want to make it
all right again...

01:18:48.072 --> 01:18:51.062
- Yeah?
- And you have to say stuff?

01:18:51.112 --> 01:18:53.152
- Apologise?
- That's the one.

01:18:53.192 --> 01:18:56.422
- I want to do that.
- You want to apologise?

01:18:56.472 --> 01:18:57.912
What do you think?

01:18:57.952 --> 01:19:00.072
Do we still have
a professional relationship?

01:19:00.112 --> 01:19:02.422
Of course we do. Why ever not?

01:19:03.192 --> 01:19:04.342
Just a minute!

01:19:06.392 --> 01:19:08.062
I love you.

01:19:08.112 --> 01:19:09.632
Yeah?

01:19:09.672 --> 01:19:13.512
Let's go crazy!
The marvellous Spice Girls!

01:19:48.152 --> 01:19:50.432
- We've got a deal.
- Yes!

01:22:42.432 --> 01:22:44.312
I'm worried about me character.

01:22:44.352 --> 01:22:46.342
It's totally unreal.

01:22:46.392 --> 01:22:48.542
I'm supposed to be the baddie,

01:22:48.592 --> 01:22:50.502
but why do I
hate the Spice Girls?

01:22:50.552 --> 01:22:53.862
- There's no reason.
- He's a caricature.

01:22:53.912 --> 01:22:56.032
Sort of this evil,
grotesque symbol

01:22:56.072 --> 01:22:58.462
about how power
corrupts and perverts.

01:22:58.512 --> 01:23:01.472
But why can't
I have a softer side?

01:23:01.512 --> 01:23:03.072
The kids are gonna hate me.

01:23:03.112 --> 01:23:04.992
They'll attack me in the street.

01:23:05.032 --> 01:23:07.752
As an artiste, a good kicking

01:23:07.792 --> 01:23:11.392
could be the highest
compliment you'll ever get.

01:23:11.432 --> 01:23:14.232
They want me to play
their road manager.

01:23:14.272 --> 01:23:16.262
I'm on a phone getting
angry all the time.

01:23:16.312 --> 01:23:18.592
I don't want to end my career.

01:23:18.632 --> 01:23:21.272
Fat, stupid, lazy -
it's all I get offered.

01:23:21.312 --> 01:23:23.432
The sort people always ignore.

01:23:23.472 --> 01:23:26.272
They want me to lose
my Scottish accent. Fine.

01:23:26.312 --> 01:23:28.192
But the chest wig...

01:23:28.232 --> 01:23:31.072
- Where's Mel B?
- There she is.

01:23:31.112 --> 01:23:33.102
- Hi, Mel.
- Hello!

01:23:33.152 --> 01:23:34.792
- Hi, Mel.
- You all right?

01:23:34.832 --> 01:23:35.902
This chest wig...

01:23:35.952 --> 01:23:39.992
- Hi. You're Mel B.
- No, C. Just call me Sporty.

01:23:42.112 --> 01:23:44.342
"All right, sweetheart!"

01:23:44.392 --> 01:23:46.352
The saying
from that film you did.

01:23:46.392 --> 01:23:49.192
- Yes.
- What was it called?

01:23:49.232 --> 01:23:51.832
- With, um...
- That was brilliant.

01:23:51.872 --> 01:23:53.702
- You were really good.
- Thank you.

01:23:53.752 --> 01:23:56.952
We'd all like to say
thank you for this.

01:23:56.992 --> 01:23:59.142
We needed
a serious actress like you

01:23:59.192 --> 01:24:01.712
to give it some depth.
We didn't want it to be...

01:24:01.752 --> 01:24:02.822
Superficial.

01:24:04.672 --> 01:24:07.062
Can I ask you
about the chest wig?

01:24:07.112 --> 01:24:08.392
Oh, Graydon!

01:24:08.432 --> 01:24:11.192
Can I speak to you
about our characters?

01:24:11.232 --> 01:24:14.192
In one scene,
I'd like to be really angry

01:24:14.232 --> 01:24:17.432
and maybe slap someone...
like Victoria.

01:24:17.472 --> 01:24:19.622
- Sure. Why not?
- Emma?

01:24:19.672 --> 01:24:24.032
And I don't want to be on an
exercise bike all the time.

01:24:24.072 --> 01:24:27.382
I've got this catch
phrase I'd like to say.

01:24:27.432 --> 01:24:29.232
I go up to somebody and go,

01:24:29.272 --> 01:24:31.262
"I'm not from London, you know!"

01:24:33.432 --> 01:24:35.662
'Cause you really are
from London, right?

01:24:35.712 --> 01:24:37.542
Is that the joke? I got it.

01:24:37.592 --> 01:24:40.112
Does he not know I'm from Leeds?

01:24:40.152 --> 01:24:41.982
You lot, someone's watching us.

01:24:42.032 --> 01:24:43.312
Oh, yeah.

01:24:43.352 --> 01:24:46.982
Look at all
those people in there.

01:24:47.072 --> 01:24:48.742
Hi! Hello!

01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:51.312
Look at them two
snogging at the back.

01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:53.582
I bet you didn't
see any of our film.

01:24:53.632 --> 01:24:57.592
- And look where your hand is!
- Go on! Go on!

01:24:57.632 --> 01:25:00.312
Look at the mess
they made with popcorn.

01:25:00.352 --> 01:25:01.792
Know what I wonder?

01:25:01.832 --> 01:25:05.192
Why do people sit there
and watch the credits?

01:25:05.232 --> 01:25:07.702
It's probably
the sad anti-climax.

01:25:07.752 --> 01:25:09.982
It's all over.
Back to reality.

01:25:10.032 --> 01:25:11.912
I know where
they're gonna go.

01:25:11.952 --> 01:25:15.632
They're gonna go to the pub
and then to the chippy.

01:25:15.672 --> 01:25:17.392
Hey, you. No, not you.
Behind you.

01:25:17.432 --> 01:25:19.792
To the left. I like your dress.

01:25:19.832 --> 01:25:21.062
Is that a new Gucci one?

01:25:21.112 --> 01:25:23.832
C & A, mate.

01:25:23.872 --> 01:25:25.862
Some people are watching
this on video.

01:25:25.912 --> 01:25:28.872
Is there nothing on telly, then?

01:25:28.912 --> 01:25:31.432
You know what
they're wondering now?

01:25:31.472 --> 01:25:32.702
What happened to the bomb?

01:28:18.232 --> 01:28:20.792
Ha ha ha!
Thank you very much.
