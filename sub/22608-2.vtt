00:46.980 --> 00:49.860
(ROARING YAWN)

01:21.100 --> 01:26.419
I'm flying over the Great
Rift Valley in East Africa.

01:26.420 --> 01:30.259
And below me,
is a landscape in turmoil,

01:30.260 --> 01:35.340
torn apart by the twisting
and buckling of the Earth's crust.

01:36.900 --> 01:42.419
It's also a landscape of huge
and unpredictable change,

01:42.420 --> 01:46.739
that forces animals, day by day,
season by season,

01:46.740 --> 01:49.539
to gamble with their lives.

01:49.540 --> 01:51.699
But for those that win,

01:51.700 --> 01:56.060
this is one of the most fertile
landscapes on Earth.

02:32.460 --> 02:37.300
Nyiragongo, the largest lava lake
in the world...

02:39.220 --> 02:42.220
..bubbling up from nearly
ten miles beneath the surface.

02:49.260 --> 02:52.900
Nowhere takes you closer to
the fiery heart of the planet.

02:59.420 --> 03:03.260
Mount Nyiragongo is one of the most
active volcanoes in Africa.

03:05.340 --> 03:07.540
Its eruptions
can be seen from space.

03:15.540 --> 03:18.739
As magma churns
below the Earth's crust,

03:18.740 --> 03:21.780
the land to the east of here
is being torn apart.

03:42.100 --> 03:47.780
Volcanoes like this are continually
changing the face of Eastern Africa.

03:59.980 --> 04:02.580
The volcanoes here
may have a violent side...

04:04.620 --> 04:07.260
..but life flows from
these infernos.

04:17.660 --> 04:21.740
Fertile ash from countless
eruptions carpets the land...

04:24.580 --> 04:28.979
..creating the ideal conditions
for grasses to flourish,

04:28.980 --> 04:30.500
on an immense scale.

04:36.540 --> 04:43.219
And with the grasses come animals in
numbers found nowhere else on Earth.

04:43.220 --> 04:44.460
Wildebeest.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.540
Nothing stands in their way.

05:08.220 --> 05:11.460
All this, just to reach fresh grass.

05:13.140 --> 05:15.700
(WILDEBEEST GRUNT)

05:28.940 --> 05:32.980
The ever-travelling herds are only
one element of life here.

05:36.620 --> 05:39.300
Look closer
and there are new stories to tell.

05:44.180 --> 05:47.420
Living on the savannah
is about making the most of the hand

05:47.421 --> 05:49.140
the landscape deals you.

05:50.460 --> 05:55.340
But here, it's always a gamble
everything may change tomorrow.

05:56.660 --> 05:59.220
From their vantage point,
agama lizards

05:59.221 --> 06:03.660
wait for the arrival of the herds,
ready to seize their moment.

06:06.340 --> 06:09.540
It's payday over a million
wildebeest on their doorstep.

06:16.700 --> 06:21.699
And with the wildebeest come flying
insects billions of them.

06:21.700 --> 06:24.819
(BUZZING)

06:24.820 --> 06:27.740
Food
if only they could catch them!

06:53.460 --> 06:55.420
Time for a rethink.

07:04.420 --> 07:08.660
This agama lizard
has spotted an opportunity.

07:20.460 --> 07:23.900
Only one thing attracts more flies
than the wildebeest...

07:26.420 --> 07:29.700
..lions that have eaten wildebeest.

07:35.540 --> 07:37.979
Lions are famously bad tempered

07:37.980 --> 07:40.980
they could swat the lizard like
the flies he's hoping to ambush.

07:51.540 --> 07:53.940
He will need to pick his target
carefully.

07:57.220 --> 07:59.260
(LOW GROWL)

08:08.860 --> 08:10.220
Not her.

08:18.300 --> 08:19.900

08:23.620 --> 08:25.580
Maybe?

08:27.940 --> 08:29.699
But no.

08:29.700 --> 08:32.140
(LIONESS RUMBLES)

08:34.820 --> 08:39.620
To be within striking distance,
he's got to hold his nerve.

08:43.539 --> 08:44.860
Got one!

08:52.260 --> 08:54.140
Now he's getting his eye in.

09:01.740 --> 09:05.180
(LIONESS RUMBLES)

09:08.140 --> 09:10.940
But this might be a bit ambitious.

09:31.260 --> 09:34.100
It may take courage to hunt
on the back of a lion...

09:37.700 --> 09:39.860
(LION RUMBLES)

09:42.620 --> 09:45.460
..but it takes sense to know
when to run away!

09:51.380 --> 09:54.618
The wildebeest won't stay for long,
and when they leave,

09:54.619 --> 09:56.260
most of the flies will follow.

09:58.580 --> 10:01.060
Change is everywhere in East Africa.

10:04.380 --> 10:07.738
This grassland was once covered by
a forest that ran

10:07.739 --> 10:10.060
unbroken from west coast
to east coast.

10:14.940 --> 10:17.139
Today, high above the plains,

10:17.140 --> 10:21.660
swirling clouds hide mountains that
tower three miles into the sky.

10:36.820 --> 10:41.138
These frozen summits now form part
of a mountainous barrier separating

10:41.139 --> 10:45.420
the ancient jungles in the west
from the savannahs of the east.

10:55.380 --> 10:58.979
Up here,
lies the largest glacier in Africa,

10:58.980 --> 11:01.180
just a few miles north
of the equator.

11:16.900 --> 11:20.340
These are the legendary
Mountains of the Moon.

11:31.700 --> 11:35.980
The height of these peaks means
they create their own weather.

11:44.500 --> 11:48.379
The local name for these mountains
is "Rwenzori"

11:48.380 --> 11:49.820
"the rain maker".

11:58.140 --> 12:03.420
(WATER DRIPPING)

12:13.820 --> 12:16.340
Meltwater flows down
from the glaciers.

12:23.820 --> 12:28.339
And on the lower slopes, all this
water supports thick jungle...

12:28.340 --> 12:32.180
(PIPING AND TRILLING BIRDSONG)

12:34.980 --> 12:37.139
..remnants of the dense,

12:37.140 --> 12:42.180
steamy forests that once dominated
the whole of East Africa.

12:46.060 --> 12:49.020
But driven by a drying climate
beyond the mountains,

12:49.021 --> 12:51.700
the forests began to wither away.

12:53.380 --> 12:57.259
Today, only small pockets
of upland jungle remain

12:57.260 --> 13:01.900
home to animals
who once roamed the ancient forests.

13:06.340 --> 13:08.820
The largest living
primates on Earth.

13:08.821 --> 13:11.020

Mountain gorillas.

(GORILLA BABY SQUEALS)

13:36.900 --> 13:41.739
This little one's ancestors
have lived in forests like these

13:41.740 --> 13:43.060
for millions of years.

14:00.780 --> 14:05.700
But all around, the world
has changed to swamp and savannah.

14:15.460 --> 14:18.939
This is the furthest
these mighty giants

14:18.940 --> 14:20.940
now venture into Eastern Africa.

14:23.740 --> 14:28.020
They're marooned on their islands
in the African sky.

14:44.900 --> 14:46.499
Below the highlands,

14:46.500 --> 14:51.020
vast wetlands cut swathes
through the open savannah.

14:54.100 --> 14:57.180
(BIRDS CHIRRUP)

15:17.020 --> 15:20.539
Bangweulu Swamp is huge

15:20.540 --> 15:23.620
its name means,
"where the water meets the sky".

15:29.740 --> 15:33.419
Hidden amongst
this maze of waterways

15:33.420 --> 15:35.860
is a creature like no other.

16:00.660 --> 16:04.940
A giant, prehistoric-looking bird.

16:06.740 --> 16:08.700
A shoebill.

16:11.620 --> 16:15.459
Standing well over a metre tall...

16:15.460 --> 16:18.100
she roams these swamps...

16:19.660 --> 16:22.780
..trying to catch catfish.

16:43.060 --> 16:45.740
Not exactly what she was after.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.740
Deeper into the swamp, lies
the reason for all this fishing.

17:04.700 --> 17:09.819
This chick is just three weeks old
and a little bit wobbly on its feet.

17:11.339 --> 17:15.419
Its vast bill
means it has trouble balancing.

17:15.420 --> 17:18.900
It won't be able to fly, or even
walk properly for several weeks.

17:22.940 --> 17:24.459
(HONKING CALL)

17:24.460 --> 17:28.499
It's entirely reliant
on its parents for food and water.

17:28.500 --> 17:29.380
(SQUEAKING CALL)

17:38.980 --> 17:41.499
There is also a smaller chick,

17:41.500 --> 17:43.260
who isn't doing so well.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.740
(CHICK'S LOW HONKING CALLS)

17:53.980 --> 17:57.020
The larger chick
pesters its mother for a drink.

18:08.060 --> 18:10.859
While she goes off to fetch water,

18:10.860 --> 18:15.540
it reveals a dark side to
the relationship with its nest mate.

18:30.340 --> 18:33.218
It's three days older than
the other chick,

18:33.219 --> 18:36.060
and has always won the race
for food and attention.

18:40.300 --> 18:43.380
This is more than just
a scrap between two siblings.

19:00.700 --> 19:04.260
As their mother returns, she sees
what the larger chick has done.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.899
The smaller chick
seeks its mother's comfort.

19:17.900 --> 19:20.940
(CHICK SQUAWKS)

19:22.500 --> 19:25.180
But she has already made her choice.

19:36.380 --> 19:38.620
Only her first-born
will get a drink.

19:48.980 --> 19:53.020
Shoebills very rarely
raise more than one chick.

19:58.900 --> 20:02.379
The younger chick
was only ever an insurance,

20:02.380 --> 20:04.980
in case the elder didn't make it.

20:16.100 --> 20:18.218
Now it's old enough,
the adults know that

20:18.219 --> 20:20.660
they're better off
putting all their efforts

20:20.661 --> 20:24.580
into bringing up
just one fit and healthy youngster.

20:28.820 --> 20:31.820
The swamp's changing water levels
mean fishing

20:31.821 --> 20:34.099
is too unpredictable for them

20:34.100 --> 20:36.300
to gamble on trying to raise
two chicks.

20:47.060 --> 20:50.900
Nothing here
stays the same for long.

20:54.380 --> 20:59.459
This is the time of year when
Eastern Africa is beginning to dry.

20:59.460 --> 21:03.939

21:03.940 --> 21:07.780
The rivers and waterholes
are shrinking.

The land continues to dry out.

21:19.940 --> 21:21.660
Tensions rise.

21:45.980 --> 21:48.220
Hippos seek what relief they can.

21:53.260 --> 21:56.299
This time of relentless drying

21:56.300 --> 22:01.340
is also when another force of change
ravages the land.

22:16.220 --> 22:21.060
Without warning, fires rip through
these tinder-dry plains.

22:30.060 --> 22:35.459
The flames sweep across the savannah
at 50 miles an hour...

22:35.460 --> 22:38.458
reaching temperatures of nearly
a thousand degrees,

22:38.459 --> 22:40.580
consuming everything in their path.

22:44.420 --> 22:47.860
Each year, an area larger than
Britain goes up in smoke.

23:25.100 --> 23:29.139
But this destruction
can bring opportunity,

23:29.140 --> 23:31.020
if you're prepared to take a risk.

23:49.660 --> 23:52.179
Drongos, bee-eaters

23:52.180 --> 23:56.220
and rollers bravely pluck fleeing
insects from amongst the flames.

24:14.060 --> 24:17.620
There's little better than
a char-grilled grasshopper.

24:25.220 --> 24:28.660
These fires may appear devastating,
but they are, in fact,

24:28.661 --> 24:33.339
part of a natural cycle that
is essential for the regeneration

24:33.340 --> 24:35.580
of East Africa's grasslands.

24:42.300 --> 24:47.140
But sometimes the cycle is broken,
just when a change is most needed.

25:12.740 --> 25:17.298
Here, on the plains of Amboseli,
in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro,

25:17.299 --> 25:20.860
the seasonal rains have failed
for the last two years.

25:25.180 --> 25:28.660
And this year,
they are already long overdue.

25:31.260 --> 25:34.820
It's the hardest drought
for half a century.

Amboseli is usually
a haven for elephants.

26:13.260 --> 26:16.340
These plains should be green
and covered with grass.

26:18.420 --> 26:21.540
Now there is nothing but dust.

26:28.940 --> 26:31.139
This family is forced to travel

With the grass gone,

26:55.700 --> 27:00.300
all the elephants can scratch
from the dust is withered twigs.

27:06.700 --> 27:11.099
The adults
might just survive on this,

27:11.100 --> 27:13.780
but it will not support
a calf for long.

27:37.460 --> 27:39.179
Every mother in the herd

27:39.180 --> 27:42.340
is struggling to provide
milk for her calf.

27:49.580 --> 27:53.500
The search for food
is increasingly urgent.

28:08.940 --> 28:11.699

28:11.700 --> 28:13.538
or stay behind with her calf,

who's becoming too weak
to even stand.

28:23.380 --> 28:25.300

31:50.500 --> 31:53.698
The face of these soda lakes
changes day by day,

31:53.699 --> 31:57.220
as the sun evaporates the water,
leaving the salts behind.

32:01.860 --> 32:06.100

32:09.740 --> 32:12.540
But life does exist, even here.

32:13.940 --> 32:17.019

are created by algae,

into the African sky.

48:04.100 --> 48:07.018
they're the highest

48:07.019 --> 48:09.420
and home to
the largest glacier in Africa.

48:14.300 --> 48:17.578
To reach the summits,
the team had to travel on foot,

48:17.579 --> 48:21.220
the same way as climbers did
when they first reached the top

48:21.221 --> 48:23.140
just over 100 years ago.

48:28.220 --> 48:30.138
It would take more than two weeks,

48:30.139 --> 48:33.100
climbing over 3,000 metres
from the valleys below.

48:37.140 --> 48:40.578
Six days into their trek,
still well below the summits,

48:40.579 --> 48:45.060
the team come to realise why
Rwenzori, the mountains' other name,

48:45.061 --> 48:47.260
means "the rain makers".

48:48.940 --> 48:52.418
Just after we set off, it started
raining, then it started hailing,

48:52.419 --> 48:55.578
and the idea had been that
we'd stop here for an hour or two

48:55.579 --> 48:58.260
and do some shots.
But as you can probably see,

48:58.261 --> 49:00.739
there's not a great deal of view.

49:00.740 --> 49:04.379

and hail and fog.

49:04.380 --> 49:08.260

so it's becoming a bit of a theme.

75 guides and helpers,

49:12.140 --> 49:15.339
it's hard going carrying
nearly a tonne of kit

through the marshy valleys.

49:18.380 --> 49:20.899
Mud, mud,

49:20.900 --> 49:22.780
and just a little bit more mud.

But it's not just the bogs
they have to deal with.

49:27.780 --> 49:31.618
There was a small, but slightly
disconcerting, earthquake last night,

49:31.619 --> 49:34.140
so let's hope we don't get any
of those below any rocks.

49:36.260 --> 49:41.300
The team continue to climb and,
before long, the rain turns to snow.

49:46.260 --> 49:49.018
They eventually arrive
at the highest hut,

49:49.019 --> 49:51.940

and nearly three miles up.

over there, down a really
treacherous precipice, is the toilet,

50:05.260 --> 50:07.940
which is just a shack
with a big hole in the floor.

50:11.180 --> 50:14.458
From here, they'll make
the hardest part of the ascent

50:14.459 --> 50:15.900
right up to the glaciers.

Well, this is, believe it or not,
one of the better viewpoints

50:26.899 --> 50:30.500
so... probably going to hang around
here for a little while,

50:30.501 --> 50:32.539
wait till the fog clears.

50:32.540 --> 50:35.340
But the weather isn't on their side.

50:38.820 --> 50:42.699
So much for hoping the weather
was going to get better.

50:42.700 --> 50:45.940

completely ill-founded.

After days of climbing and finding
the peaks hidden by fog,

increasingly impossible.

51:20.060 --> 51:21.698
It can be pretty frustrating
at times.

51:21.699 --> 51:25.180

that we've involved directly.

51:25.181 --> 51:27.299
You get all the way up here,

51:27.300 --> 51:30.378
and then we can't film anything
because of the weather.

51:30.379 --> 51:32.858
So, it is just a matter
of sitting it out and waiting.

51:32.859 --> 51:35.540
You have to sort of hope that things
come right in the end.

51:37.940 --> 51:40.380
The "rain makers" are certainly
living up to their name,

51:40.381 --> 51:42.619
but by complete contrast,

51:42.620 --> 51:45.420
other parts of East Africa
were gripped by drought.

51:48.060 --> 51:52.138
At the beginning of the production,
Mark Deeble travelled to Amboseli,

51:52.139 --> 51:54.418
just a few hundred miles
from the Rwenzoris,

51:54.419 --> 51:56.660
to film the plight
of the animals there.

51:58.380 --> 51:59.259
I mean,

51:59.260 --> 52:02.140
I've never seen anything
quite as bad as that drought.

52:05.180 --> 52:07.578
And we talked to
some of the Masai elders.

52:07.579 --> 52:10.860
They said it was the worst drought
they'd seen in 50 years.

52:12.260 --> 52:15.340
Amboseli is famous for
its huge herds of elephant,

52:15.341 --> 52:18.899
but the drought
had dispersed them far and wide.

52:18.900 --> 52:22.820
Those that remained were struggling
to find what little food was left.

52:26.420 --> 52:29.098
When we first saw the group,
we could tell instantly

52:29.099 --> 52:31.340
that they were in
a really serious condition.

52:33.700 --> 52:36.619
They were thin
and obviously starving.

to witness,

52:45.939 --> 52:49.178

the cruel power of the drought

a situation like that...

53:00.099 --> 53:02.458
You know, when
an elephant calf dies,

53:02.459 --> 53:04.498
is that when
you're actually filming it,

you're so caught up in the moment.

53:06.061 --> 53:08.339

53:08.340 --> 53:09.858
But it was only after filming,

53:09.859 --> 53:12.018
when I put the camera away
and I looked there,

53:12.019 --> 53:15.218
and there was this dead calf and
the mother standing there grieving,

53:15.219 --> 53:17.900
that the full impact
of what I'd just filmed hit me.

53:23.220 --> 53:25.018
People often say to me, you know,

53:25.019 --> 53:27.980
"Could you not have intervened
in a situation like that?"

53:29.260 --> 53:31.178
There are times when you can help,

53:31.179 --> 53:34.738
but in that time in Kenya
there WAS no food available.

53:34.739 --> 53:37.578
Now, you have to also consider
the mother.

53:37.579 --> 53:40.378
If we'd gone in there and tried
to... to take the calf away,

53:40.379 --> 53:43.938
it would have been absolute mayhem,
she'd have got incredibly stressed,

53:43.939 --> 53:46.660
and that would probably have
jeopardised her survival.

53:47.820 --> 53:51.618
In that particular situation,
when everything around us was dying,

53:51.619 --> 53:53.418
there was absolutely nothing
we could do

53:53.419 --> 53:54.820
to help that young elephant.

53:59.460 --> 54:01.899
Although too late to save the calf,

54:01.900 --> 54:05.180
a few months later,
the rains did finally return.

54:12.700 --> 54:17.259
When we returned, it was amazing.
It was lush and green again.

54:17.260 --> 54:20.138
And the elephants in the rains,
they all tend to come together,

54:20.139 --> 54:22.858
so it was like all these groups
which had been dispersed,

54:22.859 --> 54:25.098
which had been just somehow
coping on their own,

54:25.099 --> 54:26.938
all got back together again,

54:26.939 --> 54:29.060
so it was almost a sort of
festival type atmosphere.

54:37.620 --> 54:40.218
That was when, essentially,
they come together,

54:40.219 --> 54:43.780
they mate and then, after that,
lots of young calves are being born.

54:46.780 --> 54:48.819
Since the end of the drought,

54:48.820 --> 54:51.859
over 220 calves
have been born in Amboseli,

It's the biggest

55:00.220 --> 55:03.300
I think what's lovely to see
in that situation

55:03.301 --> 55:07.579
is that having been through
such a terrible drought,

55:07.580 --> 55:10.418
to see the way in which, you know,
if you let things alone,

55:10.419 --> 55:13.740
you know, they do have
incredible capacity to bounce back.

Back in the mountains,

The past few days have just been
rain and cloud and rain and cloud,

56:14.781 --> 56:19.419
and, as if by magic,
there's the most spectacular view

56:19.420 --> 56:22.339
of ice and glaciers and mountains,

56:22.340 --> 56:24.740
that you just wouldn't think
was on the equator.

56:24.741 --> 56:25.980
It's just amazing.

56:49.340 --> 56:52.578
It's the most spectacular
mountain scenery I've seen,

56:52.579 --> 56:55.540
and to think it's in Africa
is just mind-boggling.

57:03.940 --> 57:08.379
These mysterious mountains have
finally unveiled their secrets,

57:08.380 --> 57:10.259
and on the plains beyond,

57:10.260 --> 57:12.540
the elephants have returned
to their home.

57:14.340 --> 57:18.460
Despite having been explored
by film-makers for over a century,

57:18.461 --> 57:23.660
East Africa still has the power
to enchant and surprise us all.
