02:39.910 --> 02:41.912
This film is dedicated...

02:42.245 --> 02:44.247
to the memory of AndrÃ© Bazin

03:17.989 --> 03:20.117
Doinel! Bring me that!

03:27.207 --> 03:29.459
Indeed! Go to the corner!

03:36.717 --> 03:37.968
1 minute left!

03:38.885 --> 03:40.095
Quiet!

03:41.972 --> 03:44.641
We'll collect them in 30 seconds!

03:44.850 --> 03:46.143
Quiet!

03:53.859 --> 03:56.528
Line heads, get ready!

04:00.198 --> 04:02.033
I'll count to 3

04:03.702 --> 04:04.745
1...

04:05.912 --> 04:06.997
2...

04:08.623 --> 04:10.167
3! Collect!

04:18.382 --> 04:19.885
Collect in back!

04:22.053 --> 04:23.805
- Gimme!
- Wait a sec!

04:23.972 --> 04:25.891
- What is it?
- He won't give it!

04:26.057 --> 04:27.559
No favoritism!

04:29.603 --> 04:30.479
Brown-noser!

04:32.230 --> 04:34.232
Is everyone's paper in?

04:34.399 --> 04:35.734
You may go!

04:37.736 --> 04:39.905
Sorry! Not you!

04:41.239 --> 04:44.034
Recess is a reward,
not an obligation!

05:20.946 --> 05:24.157
Here
suffered Antoine Doinel unfairly...

05:24.366 --> 05:27.244
punished by a prof
for a pin-up clad barely

05:27.410 --> 05:30.372
So it's now forsooth,
eye for eye, tooth for tooth!

05:30.539 --> 05:33.458
Alright, champs,
maybe you need a ref!

05:33.625 --> 05:36.169
You can train for 3 days!
No recess!

05:36.336 --> 05:38.588
3 days of rest will do you good!

05:49.558 --> 05:51.685
Come look! This is funny!

05:52.811 --> 05:54.980
What's so interesting there?

05:55.564 --> 05:56.898
Take your seats!

06:04.489 --> 06:05.657
Bravo!

06:09.202 --> 06:11.329
We have a new Juvenal in our class!

06:11.496 --> 06:14.708
But he can't tell
an Alexandrine from a decasyllable!

06:15.292 --> 06:17.919
For tomorrow you'll conjugate...

06:18.086 --> 06:20.171
Doinel, sit down!

06:22.173 --> 06:24.259
in all tenses of the indicative...

06:24.467 --> 06:28.013
conditional and subjunctive moods...
Your notebooks!

06:30.098 --> 06:32.684
I dirty the classroom walls...

06:37.022 --> 06:39.774
and misuse French versification

06:42.193 --> 06:43.570
The Hare...

06:52.370 --> 06:54.414
Doinel, go to the janitor and...

06:54.623 --> 06:57.125
get something
to remove that nonsense...

06:57.542 --> 06:59.711
or else you'll lick it off!

07:03.048 --> 07:07.385
Richer, who said
you could change seats?

07:17.228 --> 07:20.398
In the days when the bushes...

07:21.650 --> 07:23.485
the bushes...

07:24.569 --> 07:27.030
were aflame with flowers...

07:28.031 --> 07:29.574
bright red...

07:33.453 --> 07:36.414
When already the dark tips...

07:39.084 --> 07:40.627
When already...

07:42.253 --> 07:44.047
the dark tips...

07:46.675 --> 07:48.843
of my long ears...

07:50.595 --> 07:52.305
were seen...

07:55.600 --> 07:57.519
above my head...

08:00.939 --> 08:04.192
In the still unripe rye...

08:12.158 --> 08:13.910
I munched on...

08:16.454 --> 08:17.956
the leaves...

08:22.293 --> 08:25.630
Pointing to the sky

08:33.638 --> 08:35.015
One day...

08:38.809 --> 08:41.563
comma... weary I lay...

08:46.484 --> 08:48.153
in my den...

08:51.114 --> 08:52.866
with sleep-filled eyes...

08:53.658 --> 08:56.828
When little Margot
found me by surprise!

09:01.332 --> 09:03.710
- Right, Simonot?
- It wasn't me, sir!

09:03.877 --> 09:05.128
Sure! The other guy!

09:05.503 --> 09:07.839
True, she liked me...

09:08.673 --> 09:09.841
very much...

09:10.341 --> 09:13.053
my gentle mistress!

09:23.688 --> 09:25.648
How good to me...

09:26.691 --> 09:29.360
so caring... such tenderness!

09:30.361 --> 09:33.531
How she held me on her lap...

09:34.032 --> 09:35.742
and kissed me!

09:37.202 --> 09:38.870
What fool whistled?

09:39.037 --> 09:41.873
Confess or I'll punish anybody!

09:42.207 --> 09:43.541
Right, Simonot?

09:43.708 --> 09:45.210
I swear, sir!

09:45.543 --> 09:46.753
It wasn't me!

09:47.045 --> 09:49.047
And you're cowards!

09:49.380 --> 09:50.840
What a class!

09:51.049 --> 09:54.761
I've known morons
but at least they didn't let it show

09:55.261 --> 09:57.222
They hid in their corner

09:57.555 --> 09:59.182
And you?

09:59.390 --> 10:03.186
Call that clean! You've made
it dirtier! Copy the poem!

10:03.394 --> 10:04.687
Your parents'll pay

10:04.979 --> 10:07.732
What'll France be like in 10 years?

10:15.907 --> 10:19.327
- All guys rob their parents.
- Yeah but it's hard

10:19.494 --> 10:21.246
Even Mauricet!

10:21.412 --> 10:25.250
Mauricet!
Where'd you buy those goggles?

10:25.416 --> 10:27.043
A department store

10:27.210 --> 10:30.588
Did ya swipe the money
from your dad or your ma?

10:30.880 --> 10:34.175
Don't tell me
ya don't go through their pockets!

10:34.342 --> 10:37.554
And ya got me caught earlier!

10:38.137 --> 10:40.014
Ya bastard!

10:40.181 --> 10:43.560
- Your days're numbered!
- You'll get yours!

10:46.187 --> 10:48.523
I'll never do it all tonight

10:58.449 --> 11:00.034
That prof's a bastard

11:00.368 --> 11:01.536
It's his job!

11:01.703 --> 11:03.872
But before I'm drafted...

11:04.038 --> 11:06.541
I'll bash his head in!

13:13.167 --> 13:16.546
That I would have dirtied
the classroom walls

13:30.351 --> 13:33.062
- Evening, Mama!
- Good evening...

13:40.695 --> 13:42.155
Where's the flour?

13:42.697 --> 13:46.534
- What flour?
- You didn't buy what I wrote down!

13:47.535 --> 13:50.580
- Where's the list I left you?
- I lost it

13:50.747 --> 13:53.207
No wonder
you get such bad grades!

13:53.374 --> 13:55.043
Get my slippers!

13:57.545 --> 13:59.213
In the bedroom!

13:59.547 --> 14:00.715
Under the bed!

14:06.721 --> 14:08.348
I need some flour

14:08.598 --> 14:10.224
Go get it at once!

14:12.894 --> 14:14.145
Yes, Mama

14:29.577 --> 14:32.288
They used forceps.
He came out ass first!

14:32.455 --> 14:35.166
It's hereditary!
His mother was the same way

14:35.333 --> 14:39.545
It means nothing! Look at my Fanny!
It was over in 10 minutes

14:39.712 --> 14:43.424
But for the little one,
if I hadn't had a Caesarean...

14:43.591 --> 14:45.426
we wouldn't be talkin' now!

14:45.593 --> 14:48.679
And my sister... One a year!
Can you imagine?

14:52.266 --> 14:56.354
They finally took out everything.
Blood all over the place!

14:59.607 --> 15:00.858
In a rush, son?

15:01.025 --> 15:03.152
I just got hell for some flour

15:03.319 --> 15:07.740
Don't upset your mother!
She has to be handled with care

15:08.741 --> 15:11.661
- What's that?
- An anti-fog spotlight

15:11.828 --> 15:13.871
I'm gonna try it out Sunday

15:24.465 --> 15:27.009
Look at your son!
All flour-faced!

15:27.176 --> 15:28.803
I'm not in the mood!

15:29.053 --> 15:31.472
I was hoping you were!

15:33.015 --> 15:34.225
And my change?

15:34.392 --> 15:38.229
- I need money for the cafeteria.
- Ask your dad

15:43.192 --> 15:44.944
A storm's brewing!

15:45.111 --> 15:47.822
- Papa, for the cafeteria...
- What?

15:48.156 --> 15:49.657
I need 1,000 francs

15:49.824 --> 15:53.453
Ya ask for 1,000 and hope for 500.
So ya only need 300

15:53.661 --> 15:55.454
Here's 100

15:55.997 --> 15:59.834
Take 500.
But your mom's supposed to pay that

16:00.001 --> 16:01.377
The scissors!

16:01.544 --> 16:03.671
Where are the scissors?

16:03.880 --> 16:05.840
It's not funny!

16:06.257 --> 16:09.510
No homework now! It's time to eat

16:09.969 --> 16:14.640
Right! Each thing has its time and
place. That way, the cows're safe!

16:16.350 --> 16:18.019
Is that a new pen?

16:18.853 --> 16:20.646
I made a swap for it

16:20.855 --> 16:23.024
You swap a lot lately!

16:28.738 --> 16:31.490
What's that smell?

16:32.617 --> 16:33.701
It's the fish

16:33.868 --> 16:35.119
And how!

16:37.997 --> 16:40.374
Ask your mom if her hot-pad is hot

16:40.666 --> 16:41.834
Why?

16:42.543 --> 16:43.961
For laughs!

17:01.103 --> 17:03.731
You can clear the table now

17:04.065 --> 17:07.818
Your cousin phoned.
His wife is expecting again

17:07.984 --> 17:09.153
Her 4th in 3 years?

17:09.487 --> 17:11.364
They're like rabbits. Disgusting!

17:12.323 --> 17:15.076
And what about our kid
during vacation?

17:15.242 --> 17:18.579
- Who're summer camps for?
- He'd have fun there

17:18.746 --> 17:20.164
It's 8 months off!

17:20.498 --> 17:22.916
Never too early to plan a vacation!

17:25.002 --> 17:27.505
Don't pull so hard!

17:29.006 --> 17:30.174
Great, huh?

17:30.341 --> 17:31.676
Lions' Club...

17:31.842 --> 17:33.177
What's all this?

17:33.344 --> 17:35.054
Take it easy!

17:35.680 --> 17:37.348
For Sunday's race...

17:37.515 --> 17:41.185
shall I pick the Chevreuse Valley
or along the Oise?

17:41.352 --> 17:42.979
On Sunday I rest

17:44.021 --> 17:45.898
I'm going to see Huguette

17:46.107 --> 17:47.984
But I'm the race organiser!

17:48.150 --> 17:50.945
I'm sick of housework...

17:51.112 --> 17:53.197
And dates in the afternoon!

17:53.447 --> 17:55.825
I mean the edible kind!

17:55.992 --> 17:58.369
What're you waiting for?
Go to bed!

18:00.705 --> 18:02.373
G'night!

18:03.207 --> 18:04.709
You can be so stupid!

18:05.710 --> 18:08.045
If you could only take a joke...

18:08.379 --> 18:10.881
Your auto races are a waste of time!

18:11.090 --> 18:14.218
The garbage!
Lights out as soon as you're in bed!

18:14.427 --> 18:18.556
I make contacts!
One day I'll be vice-president!

19:07.396 --> 19:10.399
Hurry up! It's late!
I didn't hear the alarm

19:27.625 --> 19:31.462
That I would have dirtied
the classroom walls!

19:34.799 --> 19:37.134
There's no socks around these holes!

19:37.343 --> 19:41.013
Buy a new pair!
The others are in the laundry

19:42.640 --> 19:46.060
I gave you money for sheets
for the kid's bed

19:46.310 --> 19:49.313
He prefers his sleeping bag

19:49.647 --> 19:51.148
Right, honey?

19:51.524 --> 19:53.776
At least I'm warm in it

19:53.984 --> 19:55.653
You still here?

19:57.238 --> 19:58.656
Bye, Pa! Mama!

20:03.160 --> 20:04.662
Don't rush so fast!

20:04.829 --> 20:09.166
We'll get locked out
and have to see the director

20:09.500 --> 20:12.002
- No need to hurry!
- Why?

20:12.336 --> 20:14.630
The prof said he won't let ya in

20:15.172 --> 20:17.425
- He means it?
- He can't stand you

20:17.591 --> 20:20.010
- Have you money?
- Yes for the canteen

20:20.177 --> 20:22.179
Trust me... This way!

20:22.513 --> 20:24.181
What'll we do now?

20:45.703 --> 20:47.204
Follow me!

20:47.955 --> 20:50.374
Put your satchel with mine

24:39.311 --> 24:40.980
Antoine! He saw me!

24:41.271 --> 24:43.482
- Which one's he?
- With dark hair

24:43.691 --> 24:45.567
But he should be in school!

24:45.901 --> 24:48.821
- You'll get it!
- She won't dare tell Dad

24:48.988 --> 24:51.281
- And the guy?
- Never saw him before!

24:51.448 --> 24:52.991
So you're safe!

25:21.186 --> 25:23.188
I'm going to school tomorrow...

25:23.355 --> 25:26.692
but I'll need an excuse.
How'll you manage?

25:26.900 --> 25:31.196
I've got an old one.
I'll cut off the date

25:31.530 --> 25:33.699
You can borrow it and copy it

25:34.032 --> 25:35.617
But the handwriting?

25:35.784 --> 25:37.411
Imitate your mother's

25:37.703 --> 25:40.205
That'll be hard. It's angular

25:40.372 --> 25:43.751
- Don't worry, it'll work.
- I hope so!

25:43.917 --> 25:45.878
- Bye!
- Bye!

25:52.301 --> 25:55.095
I ask you to please...

25:56.722 --> 25:58.474
excuse...

25:59.391 --> 26:01.018
my son...

26:05.731 --> 26:09.526
RenÃ©... who was ill...

26:10.402 --> 26:11.737
My son RenÃ©!

26:34.093 --> 26:36.261
It smells like something burnt!

26:36.470 --> 26:37.763
That's downstairs

26:37.930 --> 26:39.598
Set the table just for 2

26:39.848 --> 26:41.350
Why? Is Mom gone?

26:41.517 --> 26:44.603
She phoned me to say
she'll be late tonight

26:44.895 --> 26:47.481
Her boss needs her for the budget

26:49.274 --> 26:52.611
So we'll cook
and have a man-to-man dinner

26:53.403 --> 26:55.656
She mentioned
some eggs someplace

26:55.823 --> 26:57.449
I know where they are

27:03.455 --> 27:05.457
Did you study hard today?

27:06.667 --> 27:08.460
What'd you do?

27:08.669 --> 27:10.128
The hare

27:10.295 --> 27:11.630
And the tortoise?

27:11.964 --> 27:14.800
No, just questions about the hare

27:15.634 --> 27:18.470
- Did you answer right?
- He didn't ask me

27:18.637 --> 27:21.473
You've got to speak up!

27:21.682 --> 27:23.767
If not, you're out of the race

27:23.976 --> 27:27.062
You've got to take
the initiative in life

27:27.813 --> 27:30.941
Have you thought
of your mother's birthday?

27:31.150 --> 27:32.818
It's the 17th

27:33.152 --> 27:35.487
I hope you'll give her something

27:36.989 --> 27:38.490
You hear me?

27:40.200 --> 27:41.827
I know what you think

27:42.786 --> 27:45.330
She's been hard on you lately but...

27:45.664 --> 27:48.333
she's a very nervous woman

27:48.667 --> 27:50.836
Put yourself in her shoes!

27:51.170 --> 27:54.840
She has her housework
plus an afternoon job

27:55.048 --> 27:57.175
And this place is too tiny

27:58.010 --> 28:01.138
But we'll move.
I got a lead on a new place

28:05.142 --> 28:07.686
In an office
it's always the same story

28:07.853 --> 28:11.148
Women are exploited
and can't defend themselves

28:12.191 --> 28:15.068
But she loves you! Oh shit!

28:27.122 --> 28:29.958
- Where'd you put my Michelin guide?
- I didn't touch it

28:30.125 --> 28:32.878
You know I can't stand lying

28:34.546 --> 28:37.716
I put it in its place yesterday

28:38.050 --> 28:39.301
It's not me!

28:39.468 --> 28:42.554
It's crazy how things disappear!

28:43.972 --> 28:45.223
It's not me

28:49.102 --> 28:50.896
I'll ask your mother

28:55.651 --> 28:57.402
It's time for bed

28:58.695 --> 29:00.572
Don't forget the garbage

29:57.462 --> 29:59.131
My boss drove me home

29:59.798 --> 30:03.093
Exactly! I couldn't say no to that

30:03.260 --> 30:06.638
- Night work pays double.
- Wait'll ya see my pay!

30:06.805 --> 30:09.224
That kind of overtime is paid cash!

30:10.475 --> 30:13.311
No wonder
you need to rest on Sunday!

30:13.478 --> 30:14.896
Where's my Michelin?

30:15.063 --> 30:17.482
No idea! The kid might know

30:17.649 --> 30:19.860
- He doesn't.
- He's a liar!

30:20.027 --> 30:22.320
- Like you!
- If ya raised him right...

30:22.487 --> 30:25.198
Shit! I gave him a name!
I feed him!

30:25.657 --> 30:30.495
I'm sick of your complaints! Fed up!
If ya can't stand him, say so

30:30.662 --> 30:32.831
We'll put him in an orphanage...

30:33.165 --> 30:35.167
so I can have some peace!

30:53.935 --> 30:56.563
We'll eat out
till the end of the month!

30:56.730 --> 30:59.357
How? I don't have a clean shirt!

30:59.524 --> 31:02.069
You could at least do the collars

31:02.235 --> 31:05.072
You and your anti-foglight!
Just to show off!

31:05.280 --> 31:06.948
I bought it second-hand

31:14.539 --> 31:15.874
Go open the door

31:16.041 --> 31:17.793
Maybe it's the gas man

31:18.126 --> 31:20.128
They send a notice first

31:25.842 --> 31:28.553
I'm in Antoine's class.
Is he any better?

31:29.721 --> 31:30.514
Why?

31:30.972 --> 31:33.809
He missed school yesterday

31:34.101 --> 31:35.644
Ya hear that?

31:47.155 --> 31:49.324
You don't seem surprised

31:49.491 --> 31:53.078
Why should I be?
He's capable of anything

31:57.124 --> 31:58.667
What'll my excuse be?

31:58.834 --> 32:01.336
The bigger the lie,
the better it works

32:01.503 --> 32:04.423
When Ma broke her leg,
I went back...

32:04.589 --> 32:07.008
without an excuse

32:07.259 --> 32:10.011
I can't make up a story like that

32:10.345 --> 32:12.222
We mustn't go in together

32:12.389 --> 32:13.932
Right. You go first

32:39.332 --> 32:40.876
So there you are!

32:41.626 --> 32:44.546
Extra homework made you sick, eh?

32:44.754 --> 32:46.506
Your folks fell for it?

32:46.673 --> 32:49.801
I'd like to see
what kind of excuse you have

32:50.010 --> 32:52.387
- Let's have it.
- I don't have one

32:52.554 --> 32:55.307
You expect to get away
with it like that?

32:55.473 --> 32:57.225
It'd be too easy!

32:58.894 --> 33:01.104
Sir, it's my mother

33:01.271 --> 33:02.898
What about her?

33:03.064 --> 33:04.482
She's just died

33:07.569 --> 33:10.238
I'm sorry... I didn't know...

33:10.697 --> 33:12.574
Was she ill?

33:12.782 --> 33:14.034
Yes, sir

33:14.201 --> 33:18.288
You could've told me.
You should confide in your teachers

33:19.122 --> 33:21.416
Go join the others

33:32.427 --> 33:33.637
And your excuse?

33:33.803 --> 33:35.388
Never mind!

33:46.775 --> 33:50.070
- 'Tis best a thorn in the wood...
- ...than in the ass!

33:50.445 --> 33:54.157
If you'd wash your ears
you'd hear your prompter!

33:54.491 --> 33:55.784
Up your'ear!

33:55.951 --> 33:58.119
He's just trying to confuse me

33:58.286 --> 34:01.706
- Enough! Continue...
- I'm all mixed up

34:04.042 --> 34:05.627
Than in the flowers...

34:05.835 --> 34:08.880
...the flowers.
'Tis best independence...

34:09.880 --> 34:11.882
And incessant peril...

34:12.132 --> 34:13.635
Than slavery...

34:17.556 --> 34:21.226
In eternal April.
You're an eternal loafer! Sit down!

34:21.476 --> 34:23.103
I knew it at home!

34:23.812 --> 34:25.480
- Doinel!
- Yes, sir!

34:25.647 --> 34:26.940
I'm sorry...

34:27.190 --> 34:28.525
Simonot!

34:28.942 --> 34:30.694
The Hare...

34:45.667 --> 34:47.252
Sit down!

35:14.738 --> 35:17.616
He must be punished
within the limits...

35:17.782 --> 35:19.576
He's beyond all limits!

35:19.743 --> 35:23.121
Only his parents
can deal with such a mistake

35:23.288 --> 35:25.790
We'll settle this tonight at home!

35:33.590 --> 35:35.133
What'll you do?

35:35.467 --> 35:39.137
After this I can't live
with my parents any more

35:39.679 --> 35:41.640
I've got to disappear

35:41.890 --> 35:43.683
Mine've been through worse!

35:43.850 --> 35:47.062
Yeah, but I want
to live my own life

35:47.228 --> 35:49.147
I'll write them a letter

35:49.314 --> 35:51.483
- Right now?
- It's best that way

35:51.650 --> 35:53.151
Where'll ya sleep?

35:53.568 --> 35:55.820
I don't know. I don't care

35:55.987 --> 35:57.822
I've got an idea

35:58.073 --> 36:00.492
Be at the Pigalle fountain
in 1 hour

36:00.659 --> 36:01.826
OK

36:24.432 --> 36:26.685
It's my uncle's old print shop

36:27.018 --> 36:29.646
The floor collapsed
under the heavy machines

36:29.813 --> 36:31.398
Will it collapse again?

36:35.944 --> 36:39.364
It can't fall any lower.
You'll be warm here

36:52.293 --> 36:55.630
A mattress...
This'll do for a pillow

36:57.549 --> 36:59.050
It's real heavy!

37:01.636 --> 37:03.888
Go for a walk till midnight

37:06.891 --> 37:10.603
- Keep my satchel until tomorrow.
- OK

37:14.691 --> 37:18.862
Dear Parents... I understand
the seriousness of my lie

37:19.028 --> 37:21.698
Why'd he kill me instead of you?

37:21.865 --> 37:23.825
A matter of preference!

37:23.992 --> 37:26.119
Life between us is impossible

37:26.286 --> 37:29.748
So I'm going to try my luck
in the city or elsewhere

37:30.081 --> 37:31.750
I want to become a man

37:31.916 --> 37:35.086
When I see you again,
we'll have a full explanation

37:35.253 --> 37:37.464
I close with kisses... Antoine

37:37.630 --> 37:41.426
- It's normal that he hates me?
- You're hard on him

37:41.593 --> 37:43.303
He gets on my nerves!

38:06.284 --> 38:09.788
- Can you help me catch him?
- Sure!

38:11.623 --> 38:14.542
- Your sister?
- No, her dog got away

38:14.709 --> 38:17.629
- It's a lost dog or hers?
- I don't know!

38:21.132 --> 38:24.219
- May I help?
- Yes! The more, the better!

38:24.385 --> 38:26.638
- What's his name?
- I've no idea

38:28.640 --> 38:29.933
Forget it, kid

38:30.141 --> 38:32.143
But I saw him first!

38:32.477 --> 38:33.853
Understand me?

41:39.998 --> 41:41.165
- Doinel!
- Yes, sir?

41:41.332 --> 41:45.628
- Did things explode last night?
- No, everything was fine!

41:48.339 --> 41:50.258
Parents spoil 'em rotten!

41:52.218 --> 41:54.220
Chabrol, want some help?

41:58.474 --> 42:01.936
The last question is even easier

42:15.825 --> 42:18.036
as if you're lisping

42:20.496 --> 42:24.125
I can't. Not everyone can use
their tongue like you said

42:24.292 --> 42:28.838
Quiet!
S... Si... Go sit down!

42:30.923 --> 42:32.133
Impudent!

42:34.177 --> 42:36.012
Now you!

42:36.929 --> 42:38.848
Answer me!

43:01.871 --> 43:03.206
Doinel?

43:08.711 --> 43:11.547
Frochot, take over until I return

43:18.763 --> 43:21.390
We don't know how to handle him!

43:21.724 --> 43:24.602
Madam, you don't deserve
such a rascal

43:25.728 --> 43:26.896
My poor baby!

43:27.188 --> 43:30.066
Where'd you spend the night?

43:30.399 --> 43:33.069
- In a print shop.
- At a printer's?

43:33.402 --> 43:36.405
I don't care if he's last
so long as he behaves!

43:36.572 --> 43:37.907
Fine!

43:41.244 --> 43:43.746
Maybe it's... glandular

43:58.761 --> 44:00.805
You mustn't catch cold

44:02.306 --> 44:04.308
And now to bed!

44:05.685 --> 44:07.311
I'm not sleepy

44:08.938 --> 44:11.566
You'll be better off in our bed

44:22.910 --> 44:25.621
You know, I was your age once

44:26.080 --> 44:27.498
Kids forget that!

44:27.665 --> 44:30.459
I was stubborn
and wouldn't confide in my parents

44:30.668 --> 44:32.837
So I wrote everything in a diary

44:33.254 --> 44:37.258
Nobody's ever read it.
One day I'll show it to you

44:38.134 --> 44:43.014
At your age I went on vacation
with a shepherd boy I liked but...

44:43.181 --> 44:47.518
they caught us! Ma made me swear
not to see him again...

44:47.685 --> 44:51.564
and never told Papa.
So I cried a lot but I obeyed her

44:51.939 --> 44:56.235
We should always obey our mothers!
We can have secrets!

44:57.486 --> 45:00.031
What did you mean in your letter...

45:00.364 --> 45:02.575
about having a full explanation?

45:03.242 --> 45:07.496
I meant about my bad behavior
and why I don't study hard

45:07.663 --> 45:09.582
So, tell me...

45:09.790 --> 45:11.667
I don't know how to listen...

45:11.918 --> 45:14.587
so I want to quit
and earn my own living

45:15.713 --> 45:17.840
That's crazy! You've no idea!

45:18.174 --> 45:21.010
I so regret not going
beyond high school!

45:21.177 --> 45:23.804
Your dad has only
an elementary diploma

45:24.055 --> 45:25.598
It hampers him!

45:26.515 --> 45:29.352
I know school
teaches lots of useless stuff

45:29.685 --> 45:31.687
Algebra and science don't...

45:32.521 --> 45:34.023
help many people

45:34.190 --> 45:38.694
But French! You always need it
for writing letters!

45:39.528 --> 45:41.864
Let's share another secret, OK?

45:44.200 --> 45:47.954
On your next French essay...
if you're among...

45:48.412 --> 45:51.666
the top 5,
I'll give you 1,000 francs!

45:53.209 --> 45:55.378
But don't tell your father!

47:32.058 --> 47:34.643
Suddenly the dying man
rose up on his fists...

47:34.810 --> 47:38.481
and shot a lightning glance
at his terrified children

47:38.647 --> 47:41.525
The hair at his nape moved.
His wrinkles quivered

47:41.692 --> 47:43.486
His face brightened

47:43.819 --> 47:47.990
A breath wafted his face, making it
sublime. He lifted his fist...

47:48.657 --> 47:51.535
and shouted
Archimedes' famous word...

47:51.744 --> 47:54.163
Eureka! I have found it!

48:07.510 --> 48:12.306
Describe a major event you witnessed
and which concerned you personally

48:14.183 --> 48:16.185
Eureka! I have found it!

48:19.939 --> 48:21.357
The Death...

48:22.858 --> 48:25.611
of My Grandfather

48:53.556 --> 48:56.642
The monkey's finally laid
the new typist!

48:57.601 --> 48:59.395
She's made the most of it!

48:59.645 --> 49:03.566
She got herself named
executive secretary

49:04.733 --> 49:07.570
She fills all the requirements!

49:07.903 --> 49:11.407
Gotta be careful of her now
because of pillow talk!

49:12.241 --> 49:16.203
When she was on the road, I told her
how to juggle her expense account

49:16.370 --> 49:19.540
Instead of that,
she stayed in 3-star hotels!

49:20.749 --> 49:24.503
Say, I still haven't found
my Michelin hotel guide

49:25.504 --> 49:27.590
One of you has moved it

49:27.756 --> 49:29.758
Oh, you and your Michelin!

49:30.092 --> 49:32.219
I don't like mysteries

49:32.845 --> 49:34.471
What's on the stove?

49:34.638 --> 49:36.432
Nothing! I'm sure!

49:40.936 --> 49:42.605
Put it out! Don't yell!

49:43.272 --> 49:44.940
Get some water!

49:48.777 --> 49:50.946
Ya blockhead!

49:51.280 --> 49:54.783
What made ya
light a candle in there?

49:55.117 --> 49:56.452
It was for Balzac!

49:56.785 --> 49:59.997
Balzac? Ya take me for a fool?

50:00.164 --> 50:03.459
- For my French essay!
- Yes, he promised me something

50:03.626 --> 50:06.378
What? A bonus for fire damage?

50:06.629 --> 50:08.547
Ya need more than a candle!

50:08.714 --> 50:11.800
- Want my lighter?
- Don't be silly!

50:11.967 --> 50:15.638
For as long as you're living here,
you'll do as I say!

50:15.888 --> 50:18.140
If not, it means military academy!

50:18.307 --> 50:21.644
Know what that is?
You'll find out!

50:21.977 --> 50:23.646
And you'll toe the line!

50:24.647 --> 50:26.982
Know what we'll do
for a change of air?

50:27.316 --> 50:29.318
We'll all go to the movies tonight!

50:29.652 --> 50:33.489
Fine! A great method of education!

50:33.822 --> 50:37.159
- How's your French essay?
- Not bad

50:39.245 --> 50:42.164
Listen, Julian... Trust us!

50:43.040 --> 50:44.833
He wants to surprise us

50:45.000 --> 50:47.920
- I don't like this!
- Take us to the movies?

50:48.170 --> 50:50.506
- What's playing?
- Paris Is Ours

50:50.756 --> 50:53.509
- If you're plotting...
- Rather not go?

50:53.676 --> 50:57.721
Sure, I'll go!
I've worked hard. I deserve it!

50:58.264 --> 51:01.976
But the Gaumont Theatre
doesn't like arsonists!

51:21.537 --> 51:25.291
My ice cream bar was good!
I'd never had strawberry

51:25.499 --> 51:27.251
They're not in season!

51:33.882 --> 51:37.720
She really had... how shall I say...
she had lots of...

51:37.886 --> 51:41.974
- That's all you ever notice!
- Lots of class!

51:45.728 --> 51:49.565
- I liked that movie.
- Yeah, but it wasn't funny

51:50.232 --> 51:53.235
Not funny? But it had depth!

51:53.569 --> 51:55.404
- What?
- Depth!

51:57.239 --> 51:58.741
- The movie!
- Yeah...

52:03.912 --> 52:05.873
It's time for bed

52:06.040 --> 52:07.750
Beddy-bye!

52:11.920 --> 52:15.424
It's Satan's general and his staff!

52:18.594 --> 52:20.888
Your mom's got nice legs, eh?

52:32.274 --> 52:35.611
Back to our happy hearth...
but a little smoky!

52:35.778 --> 52:38.072
The garbage, honey!

52:38.781 --> 52:42.326
I hope I won't regret
trying to win him over

53:31.500 --> 53:32.292
Doinel!

53:32.459 --> 53:36.255
If your essay is first today
it's because I've decided...

53:36.422 --> 53:39.675
to rank them
by starting from the bottom

53:39.842 --> 53:43.595
Your search for the absolute
led you straight to a zero

53:43.804 --> 53:46.223
For you who don't know Balzac...

53:46.390 --> 53:49.351
it concerns A Gloomy Affair

53:49.518 --> 53:52.396
Doinel has the right to take

53:52.563 --> 53:55.649
the death of a relative
as his subject...

53:55.816 --> 53:58.527
although we know
he easily sacrifices his dear ones

53:58.694 --> 54:00.320
whenever convenient

54:00.487 --> 54:02.072
I didn't copy, sir!

54:02.489 --> 54:04.116
Listen to this!

54:04.783 --> 54:06.952
Suddenly the dying man rose up...

54:07.119 --> 54:10.289
and shot a lightning glance
at his terrified children

54:10.456 --> 54:14.209
His hair stood on end
and his eyebrows arched

54:14.376 --> 54:17.129
His face brightened
with a sublime look

54:17.296 --> 54:22.593
He shouted Archimedes' famous
word... Eureka! I've found it!

54:22.843 --> 54:24.636
Well, I found it too!

54:24.970 --> 54:28.015
- You plagiarist!
- It's not true!

54:28.223 --> 54:30.893
Take your essay at once
to the principal

54:31.059 --> 54:32.644
Colombel, go with him

54:34.980 --> 54:37.065
And stay out
till the end of the term!

54:49.411 --> 54:50.746
What's with you?

54:52.414 --> 54:55.083
I sat next to him.
He didn't copy it!

54:55.250 --> 54:56.877
Want to be expelled?

54:57.252 --> 54:58.170
That's OK

54:59.421 --> 55:01.048
Such impudence!

55:01.757 --> 55:05.093
- Get out!
- Expel me but don't kick me out!

55:05.260 --> 55:06.428
Out!

55:06.595 --> 55:08.263
That's illegal!

55:08.597 --> 55:12.267
I'll show you
who makes the laws here!

55:22.444 --> 55:24.112
Did you take him?

55:24.446 --> 55:26.114
- He ran away.
- Ran away?

55:31.620 --> 55:35.123
I slugged him and ran

55:37.751 --> 55:38.961
And you?

55:39.127 --> 55:42.130
He threw me out
till after Christmas

55:47.803 --> 55:51.181
Now I really can't go home.

55:51.348 --> 55:53.350
Dad said
he'd put me in an academy

55:53.517 --> 55:56.645
- What's that?
- Something military

55:56.979 --> 55:59.481
You'd have a uniform and a future

55:59.648 --> 56:01.650
No thanks!

56:01.984 --> 56:03.986
If only it were the Navy!

56:04.319 --> 56:06.864
I'd like to see the ocean.

56:07.030 --> 56:08.991
I've seen the Channel,
the Atlantic...

56:09.157 --> 56:11.994
and the Mediterranean
but not the North Sea

56:12.286 --> 56:14.663
Stay at my house. We'll manage!

56:41.690 --> 56:43.734
Holy cow! A horse!

56:44.693 --> 56:46.612
It's my dad's. A souvenir!

56:48.697 --> 56:50.699
What a huge place!

56:52.534 --> 56:55.537
Clean off the sofa.
You can sleep here

56:55.871 --> 56:57.205
And your parents?

56:57.539 --> 57:00.375
Never here! Mom drinks
and Dad is always...

57:00.542 --> 57:03.045
at the races.
This place is wide open

57:03.211 --> 57:05.047
We need to start a business

57:05.380 --> 57:07.299
Yeah, we need money

57:07.549 --> 57:09.551
But we need some to start with

57:09.718 --> 57:11.386
In that case...

57:11.553 --> 57:14.222
I'll use part of my inheritance

57:14.389 --> 57:17.059
Quiet! Mom may be around

57:24.399 --> 57:26.193
Anyone here?

59:31.693 --> 59:34.529
- Hello, madam!
- Little devil!

01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:06.394
- Seen your mother lately?
- Today after school

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:11.650
She makes sure
her hours never coincide with mine

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.902
She must be up to something

01:00:15.904 --> 01:00:17.239
Where's the fruit?

01:00:40.929 --> 01:00:42.764
Here!

01:01:27.642 --> 01:01:29.978
Hurry up! We'll miss the news!

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:39.487
Yeah, I know, Inspector,
you'll lock me up for life

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:43.158
But drop by Duely's around 8:00

01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:46.369
Ya might meet a pal
with sharp teeth

01:02:19.694 --> 01:02:21.363
I'm thirsty!

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:27.035
It's already empty!

01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:29.037
Come on! Play!

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:31.248
You threw a 12?

01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:42.133
It's my old man!

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:44.552
Help shake the blankets!

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:54.229
That's enough!

01:02:57.232 --> 01:03:00.110
What's going on? It's a smokehouse!

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:02.070
A real gambling den!

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:05.740
I'll deduct 3 cigars
from your allowance

01:03:06.074 --> 01:03:09.077
Bucephalus is not for your junk!

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:15.000
He's worth a million!
A work of art!

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:18.670
I'll never give him up
until the last minute!

01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:23.091
Now turn out the lights
and go to sleep!

01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:25.552
- 'Night, Pa!
- Goodnight!

01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:35.270
- Not bad!
- By god!

01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:41.067
Great!

01:03:43.778 --> 01:03:45.447
Give me your Michelin

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.407
A million'd be great!

01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:50.410
My dad would kill me
because of that horse

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:53.079
With a million
we'll find a beach...

01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:55.999
open a boat business
and no one'll bother us!

01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:57.644
- Make up your mind.
- Dad's office has some

01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:01.314
- Don't back down!
- We can't sell it. They're numbered

01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:03.858
- We won't sell it, we'll pawn it!
- Smart!

01:05:04.025 --> 01:05:05.610
Ma pawned all our stuff

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:43.536
- How much?
- 10o/o

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:46.706
- 1,000 right away.
- When you come back!

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.707
You sure trust me!

01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:25.912
Give us back our typewriter!
Runnin' away?

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:29.415
- I thought you'd gone this way.
- Sure!

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:31.084
They wouldn't take it!

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:32.752
Then give it back

01:09:33.086 --> 01:09:36.798
- Gimme 500 for the time I spent.
- We're broke

01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:39.926
Ya must have something!
300 and that'll do it

01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:42.261
No! Give it back!

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:45.765
I don't work for free!
I'll keep it as a deposit

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:47.600
It's ours!

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:49.935
Give it back or I'll slug ya!

01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:53.356
Hands off!
It's no more yours than it is mine!

01:09:53.648 --> 01:09:57.193
- Let's ask that cop.
- Shut up!

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:02.448
Keep the damn thing! Shit-heads!

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:08.830
- I'm tired of carrying it!
- It's your turn

01:10:08.996 --> 01:10:10.998
Dad'll surely think I swiped it

01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:13.543
- It was your idea.
- Yours!

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:17.130
- I don't care. I quit!
- Ya lost your mind?

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:20.591
I gotta take it back
to Dad's office but...

01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:25.388
I'll wear a hat. If the guard
sees me, he'll think it's a man

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:28.724
Take it back for me!

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:31.144
No way! It wasn't my idea!

01:10:31.477 --> 01:10:32.979
You're a bastard!

01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:34.814
I'll put my hat on

01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:36.899
Wait for me by the store

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:15.021
Why, you're the Doinel boy!

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:19.192
Put that down!
Your papa's gonna love this!

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:23.863
And I get hell for not watching
things enough! This'll cost ya!

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:27.033
And don't try to pull
a Houdini on me!

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.453
I know the ropes!
I don't like smarties like you

01:11:31.913 --> 01:11:35.875
Mr. Doinel? I'm sorry
to call during your meeting

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:39.378
You'll have to come upstairs

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:44.675
I got a surprise for you...
but not a nice one!

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.722
Don't touch that hat!

01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:57.980
You think I'm takin' ya to a party?

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:01.901
The joke's over! Your ma and I
wanna be able to sleep nights

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:05.238
Take a good look at your pal

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:07.740
You won't see him for a while!

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:27.093
Maybe this'll set your head right.
It can't go on like this!

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.346
If I'd done this,
my dad would've laid me flat

01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:34.600
Is the captain in?

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:43.860
We've tried everything...
kindness, persuasion, punishment...

01:12:44.151 --> 01:12:46.028
but we've never beaten him!

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:48.197
At times the good old methods...

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:51.784
Yes, but we're not like that

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.912
- We left him free.
- Maybe too free!

01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:56.414
I wouldn't say so

01:12:56.581 --> 01:13:00.084
But since we both work,
you know how it is

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:02.670
Yes, I'm a father too

01:13:02.837 --> 01:13:05.214
At times it's hard
to know what to do

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:08.050
If only he'd confide in us!

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:10.511
We talk to him,
his mind's elsewhere

01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:12.471
You think he's listening?

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:15.474
Look how I found him!

01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:18.477
Who knows what's on his mind?

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:19.437
Cabanel!

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:23.983
Please take this boy's statement

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:26.527
- Vagrancy and theft!
- Right, boss

01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:28.321
Come on!

01:13:33.993 --> 01:13:35.828
So what's your decision?

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:40.499
For now, we can't have him at home.
He'd run off again

01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:43.961
If you could put him somewhere
under surveillance...

01:13:44.128 --> 01:13:46.714
like in the country
and put him to work

01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:49.008
He won't do anything in school

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:51.677
We could try
an Observation Center

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:55.514
They're well organized now,
with wood and metal workshops

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:57.350
That would do him good

01:13:57.683 --> 01:14:00.186
If they have room!

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:04.690
You'll have ask
for a paternal correction...

01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:08.694
so Probational Education
can take charge of him

01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:12.365
He'll go before
the juvenile court judge tomorrow

01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:16.744
- You or your wife should be there.
- Alright!

01:14:17.703 --> 01:14:20.414
- Anyone see you enter the building?
- No

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:22.541
...hereby...

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:26.837
declares he entered the building
surreptitiously...

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:36.722
...one typewriter

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:42.228
Sign here!

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:44.397
- Charles!
- Yeah?

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:46.065
He's yours!

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:47.566
Come on!

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:52.154
That way!

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:04.125
- He's yours. I'm goin' home.
- OK

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:42.371
- What'd you do?
- Ran away from home

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:45.041
And you?

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:47.585
Me...

01:16:30.503 --> 01:16:32.505
The gals're here!

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:41.347
I've seen cleaner precincts
in movies

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:44.517
I've seen dirtier

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.393
I've seen cheerier!

01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:53.275
Move!

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:33.232
The chariot's here!

01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:53.085
Put on your jacket!

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:54.039
Tie, belt, shoelaces...
Empty your pockets!

01:19:58.043 --> 01:19:59.378
Sign there!

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:23.402
Sign here!

01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:10.486
We could try taking him back but...

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:13.405
he'd have to promise
to change completely

01:23:13.572 --> 01:23:15.991
If you could frighten him...

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:17.242
That's not my role

01:23:17.576 --> 01:23:19.411
We've no control over him!

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:23.081
Maybe you try to control him
only intermittently

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:26.460
Is the boy often left alone
on the weekends...

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:27.794
at home?

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:30.422
My husband belongs
to a car racing club

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:33.258
So we sometimes leave
the boy at home...

01:23:33.592 --> 01:23:36.512
but he hates sports!
He prefers going...

01:23:36.762 --> 01:23:38.889
to movies and ruining his eyes

01:23:39.097 --> 01:23:41.475
And your husband? He's his son!

01:23:43.936 --> 01:23:47.189
No. He married me
when the boy was a baby

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:48.941
Very honorable!

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:51.443
I shouldn't have said that

01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:55.781
On the contrary!
I think it's best we send the boy...

01:23:55.989 --> 01:23:57.950
to an observation center

01:23:58.283 --> 01:24:00.244
One near the seashore?

01:24:00.953 --> 01:24:03.622
We don't run vacation camps!

01:24:03.956 --> 01:24:07.084
I'll do my best
with whatever is available

01:24:07.251 --> 01:24:11.129
We'll keep him 2 or 3 months
while I investigate his case

01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:13.173
Then we'll reach a decision

01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:16.301
This processing is bound
to do him good

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:18.804
- Goodbye, Judge.
- Goodbye, Madam

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:26.853
Juvenile Delinquency Center

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:04.808
- What're you in for?
- And you?

01:25:04.975 --> 01:25:08.061
- I slipped up!
- I swiped a typewriter

01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:10.814
A typewriter? Not very bright!

01:25:10.981 --> 01:25:14.568
They've all got serial numbers!

01:25:15.235 --> 01:25:16.737
See that big guy?

01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:19.740
He swiped automobile tires

01:25:20.907 --> 01:25:22.826
At home every time I'd cry...

01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:26.079
my dad would imitate my crying
with his violin...

01:25:26.246 --> 01:25:27.914
just to tease me

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:31.710
One day I got fed up
and I slugged him

01:25:31.877 --> 01:25:34.588
I'd kill my old man if he did that

01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:39.926
Who's that guy?

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:43.430
He ran away last week.
He got caught!

01:25:45.599 --> 01:25:49.144
Running away's not forbidden,
but getting caught is!

01:25:57.444 --> 01:25:59.112
What's going on?

01:25:59.446 --> 01:26:01.281
Line up!

01:26:01.782 --> 01:26:03.116
What're you up to?

01:27:04.344 --> 01:27:06.012
Show me your bread!

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:08.515
Alright...

01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:11.017
You bit into yours!

01:27:11.351 --> 01:27:13.687
Bring your bread and dish over here

01:27:25.031 --> 01:27:26.700
Left or right?

01:27:36.376 --> 01:27:38.378
Quiet!

01:27:48.388 --> 01:27:51.725
I bet you'd get caught and I won!

01:27:56.730 --> 01:27:59.691
I don't care!
For 5 days I had so much fun...

01:27:59.858 --> 01:28:02.402
I'll do it again first chance I get

01:28:02.736 --> 01:28:04.070
What're you up to?

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.534
Kanayan! To the psychologist!

01:28:10.744 --> 01:28:12.829
If she drops a pencil,
pick it up...

01:28:12.996 --> 01:28:16.249
without looking at her legs
or it'll go in your file

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:19.586
- What file?
- It says what they think of you...

01:28:19.753 --> 01:28:22.881
the judge, doctor,
even your parents' neighbors

01:28:23.089 --> 01:28:24.925
I know my file by heart

01:28:25.592 --> 01:28:29.763
I'm psychomotorally unstable
with perverse tendencies

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:31.932
What if I say some nonsense?

01:28:32.265 --> 01:28:36.645
You'll go to the booby hatch and
that'll send you around the bend!

01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:44.778
Why'd you return the typewriter?

01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:48.615
I couldn't sell it.
I didn't know what to do

01:28:48.782 --> 01:28:52.035
I was scared... so I took it back

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:53.870
I don't know why

01:28:54.287 --> 01:28:57.624
And you stole 10,000 francs
from your grandmother?

01:28:57.791 --> 01:29:00.126
She asked me over for her birthday

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:02.629
She was old and didn't eat much

01:29:02.963 --> 01:29:06.967
She hung on to her money but
didn't need it. She was gonna die

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:10.679
I knew the hiding place
so I swiped some

01:29:11.638 --> 01:29:13.807
I knew she'd never miss it

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:15.976
And she never did!

01:29:16.309 --> 01:29:19.145
She gave me
a very nice book that day

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:24.317
My mother would always
go through my pockets and...

01:29:24.609 --> 01:29:26.987
my pants were on the bed
that night...

01:29:27.153 --> 01:29:30.156
so she came in
and swiped the money...

01:29:30.323 --> 01:29:32.576
'cause the next day it was gone

01:29:32.742 --> 01:29:37.122
Then she made me confess
I'd taken it from my grandma

01:29:37.414 --> 01:29:40.959
So she took away the book
Grandma had given me

01:29:41.501 --> 01:29:43.879
One day I asked to read it and...

01:29:44.504 --> 01:29:46.715
found out she'd sold it

01:29:48.508 --> 01:29:50.844
Your parents say you always lie

01:29:52.345 --> 01:29:54.681
I lie... once in a while

01:29:55.348 --> 01:29:58.935
At times, if I told the truth
they wouldn't believe me!

01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:00.854
So I tell lies

01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:03.231
Why don't you love your mother?

01:30:03.523 --> 01:30:06.234
At first I was placed
with a foster mother

01:30:06.401 --> 01:30:09.321
When the money ran out,
I went to Grandma's

01:30:10.196 --> 01:30:13.366
Then she got old
and couldn't keep me so...

01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:16.870
I went to live with my folks
but I was already 8

01:30:17.704 --> 01:30:20.040
I realized Mom didn't like me much

01:30:20.206 --> 01:30:24.210
She'd nag at me
for little insignificant things

01:30:27.297 --> 01:30:30.216
Then there were fights at home

01:30:31.051 --> 01:30:33.053
I heard...

01:30:35.388 --> 01:30:40.435
that when my mother had me
she was a bachelor mother

01:30:41.019 --> 01:30:45.315
Once she fought with Grandma
and I found out...

01:30:45.482 --> 01:30:48.735
she wanted an abortion

01:30:48.902 --> 01:30:51.196
So I was born thanks to Grandma

01:30:51.363 --> 01:30:53.573
Have you ever slept with a girl?

01:30:57.994 --> 01:31:02.207
No, but I know some pals
who have and they said...

01:31:02.415 --> 01:31:05.502
if I really wanted to,
I should go to rue St-Denis

01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:07.420
So I went and...

01:31:08.421 --> 01:31:11.049
asked a few girls
and they gave me hell

01:31:11.216 --> 01:31:13.051
I got scared and left

01:31:13.259 --> 01:31:15.387
But I went back a few times

01:31:15.553 --> 01:31:19.641
A guy noticed me in the street
and said What're you doin' here?

01:31:19.808 --> 01:31:25.563
He was a North African. I explained
and he said he knew one who'd go...

01:31:27.607 --> 01:31:31.611
with young guys and all that

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:36.282
He took me to her hotel...

01:31:36.449 --> 01:31:38.743
but she wasn't there that day

01:31:39.035 --> 01:31:43.039
We waited an hour or 2...
then I left

01:32:41.556 --> 01:32:43.349
No, I came alone

01:32:43.516 --> 01:32:44.893
That way?

01:33:09.334 --> 01:33:12.712
Your personal letter
hurt your father a lot

01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:16.007
You're naÃ¯ve to think
he wouldn't show it to me

01:33:16.216 --> 01:33:18.676
In spite of things
we're a solid couple

01:33:18.843 --> 01:33:22.722
I've known hard times but it wasn't
smart to remind him about it

01:33:22.889 --> 01:33:24.557
Didn't he give you a name?

01:33:27.185 --> 01:33:28.728
We were ready...

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:32.649
to take you back home
but now it's impossible...

01:33:32.816 --> 01:33:35.819
due to the gossip
and your talk to the neighbors

01:33:36.569 --> 01:33:37.987
I didn't say a thing!

01:33:38.196 --> 01:33:41.991
But I'm used to it! I've had idiots
attacking me all my life

01:33:42.158 --> 01:33:44.577
That's all I have to say to you

01:33:44.744 --> 01:33:46.454
Don't play the martyr!

01:33:47.539 --> 01:33:51.292
Your father says
he doesn't care what happens to you

01:33:51.918 --> 01:33:54.963
You can go to a trade school

01:33:55.547 --> 01:33:57.215
You wanted a job?

01:33:57.382 --> 01:34:00.051
You'll see how much fun
a foundry can be!
