Steve, this isn't

I think you did a really

09:36.575 --> 09:37.994
good job working with contrast.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.245
You've got some areas
that are really saturated black

09:39.328 --> 09:41.998
in the mustache and the beard,

09:42.081 --> 09:43.332
the little hairs,
and you used contrast from

09:43.416 --> 09:47.044
the negative board to let
those blacks really stand out.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.462

10:05.771 --> 10:07.690
The hair has
a great flow to it.

10:07.773 --> 10:08.816
I love how dark it gets at
the bottom,

10:08.899 --> 10:11.360
and then contrast of the hair
lightening

10:11.444 --> 10:12.737
as it goes up to the top.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.739
- Where I'm having
a hard time is anatomy overall.

10:14.822 --> 10:18.743
The hand-to-face ratio,
it's awkward for me.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.661
The left shoulder
in relationship to the right

10:20.745 --> 10:21.787
are on two different planes,

10:21.871 --> 10:23.581
and here throat's wider than
her head,

10:23.664 --> 10:28.044
so it has a strange
look to it in that way.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.170

artistically, you really showed

10:34.800 --> 10:37.011
great balance, harmony
between the light and the dark.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.889
No better way to suggest
contrast than the silhouette

10:39.972 --> 10:41.223
against the wood surface.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.727
- In the face, the eye,
the wrinkles around the eye,

10:44.810 --> 10:47.563
the creases of the nose, the
cheek coming into the mustache,

10:47.646 --> 10:49.940
and the shadow on the lip--you
have a lot of contrast

10:50.024 --> 10:51.233
between similar tones,

10:51.317 --> 10:55.321
which really help build
the details in this image.

10:55.404 --> 10:56.697
This medium suited you
all really well.

10:56.781 --> 11:00.534

value

11:20.221 --> 11:21.764
on Team Anthony in the hair...

11:21.847 --> 11:22.807
- But anatomically speaking,

11:22.890 --> 11:25.309
it knocks it out
of the running for me.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.395
- I agree with you.
- I was super impressed

11:27.478 --> 11:28.312

and texture

11:28.396 --> 11:30.773
Team DJ was able to get.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.942

the most texture for sure.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.860
- Yes, but you also have,
on Team Steve,

11:34.944 --> 11:37.446
the crown of thorns--
sharp, detailed out--

11:37.530 --> 11:42.034
{\an8}- But nose for nose, Team DJ's
nose flows a lot smoother...

11:42.118 --> 11:44.703
{\an8}And beard versus beard,
the detail and the flow

11:44.787 --> 11:46.956
{\an8}of Team DJ's beard is
over the top.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.668
