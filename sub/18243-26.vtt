You're telling me
these are magic spices?

Do you mean magic in
a metaphorical sense?

- Spelling everyone?
- Who's Chuck?

could be anyone.

Her age and appearance
could be completely different.

you just said magic.

Oh, no.
So did I.

she used werepo sugar

a physical spell.

- Mom, what are you
thinking?

22:29.391 --> 22:30.871
It's okay, Scott.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.568
Ida fixed everything.

22:32.655 --> 22:33.743
What do you mean?

22:33.830 --> 22:36.180
Just watch the TV.

22:36.267 --> 22:39.967
Man: Hold on.
Let's now go down to
our reporter on the street.

22:40.054 --> 22:42.012
With the polls
about to close,

22:42.099 --> 22:45.755
a stunning hidden video
has just been released
to the press.

22:45.842 --> 22:47.583
Go ahead,
look all you want.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.498
You really think I'd put
anything in writing?

22:49.585 --> 22:52.196
Do you know how many people
I promised things too?

22:52.283 --> 22:54.721
Vicki Hammond.
She thinks she's gonna be
my press secretary.

22:54.808 --> 22:57.463
- She's not?
- No. I just said that
so she'd write

22:57.550 --> 22:59.639
glowing articles about me
and trash Terri in the paper.

22:59.726 --> 23:01.380
Ida: What are you
gonna do when

23:01.467 --> 23:03.512
people expect you to
make good on your promises?

23:03.599 --> 23:05.122
[chuckles]
Too late.

23:05.209 --> 23:06.646
I'll already be mayor.

23:06.733 --> 23:09.170
In a dramatic
turn of events,

23:09.257 --> 23:12.303
we have just learned that
Adam Lever has just
dropped out of the race.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.697
- [gasping]
- He has conceded
to Terri Quinn,

23:14.784 --> 23:17.134
who will be the next mayor
of Saffron Falls.

23:18.788 --> 23:19.833
W-- wh--

23:19.920 --> 23:21.312
I don't understand.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.488
I won?

23:22.575 --> 23:24.968
Congratulations,
Madam Mayor.

23:25.055 --> 23:26.970
[cheering]

23:29.669 --> 23:31.801
I'm the first man
of Saffron Falls.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.107
[laughing]

23:33.194 --> 23:34.717
Wait.
What did you guys do?

23:34.804 --> 23:38.504
We didn't do anything.
It was all Mama P.

23:38.591 --> 23:41.420
[scoffs] Oh,
it was a team effort.

23:41.507 --> 23:44.901
Luckily,
Becky was smart enough
to keep her phone on.

23:44.988 --> 23:48.209
Thanks to Kelly for
teaching me how to use
the video.

23:48.296 --> 23:49.863
[laughing]

23:52.996 --> 23:55.129
- Congrats, Mrs. Q.
- Congratulations.

23:55.216 --> 23:57.087
Thanks, Darbie.

23:57.174 --> 23:59.089
Terri.

23:59.176 --> 24:01.483
I'm sorry for everything.

24:01.570 --> 24:02.615
You deserve to be mayor.

24:04.834 --> 24:06.227
Thanks, Ida.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.404
I don't know
what to say, Mama P.

24:09.491 --> 24:12.363
There's nothing
to say, Jake.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.409
I promise I will never
give you a reason

24:14.496 --> 24:15.584
to doubt me again.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.632
I assume you can open
the cafe tomorrow.

24:19.719 --> 24:22.330
I think I'm gonna be
up late celebrating.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.245
[chuckling]

24:27.944 --> 24:29.729
Bye-bye,
in-betweeners.

24:29.816 --> 24:31.121
I wish I felt like
celebrating.

24:32.862 --> 24:35.474
Looks like we won't be
needing this anymore.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.606
At least we have
our memories.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.129
And the guilt.

24:39.216 --> 24:40.783
We were the protectors,

24:40.870 --> 24:42.959
and we failed.

24:43.046 --> 24:45.396
Maybe Caroline
was right.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.877
We're better off
without magic.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.270
Wait a minute.

24:49.357 --> 24:50.880
I just remembered.
The box.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.503
We're not out of magic
just yet.

25:04.590 --> 25:08.245
It's clearly vanilla,
but what spice family
does it belong to?

25:08.332 --> 25:10.073
[rustling]

25:14.425 --> 25:16.471
"Come Back Kombucha Tea."

25:16.558 --> 25:18.473
"When life around
appears to wither,

25:18.560 --> 25:20.519
"allow two drops of elixir,

25:20.606 --> 25:22.390
"take heart when buds
around you waken,

25:22.477 --> 25:25.001
"but remember something
will be forsaken."

25:25.088 --> 25:27.482
So all we have to do
is drink this

25:27.569 --> 25:29.266
to bring back
the spices?

25:29.353 --> 25:31.747
No, we don't drink it.

25:31.834 --> 25:34.054
I think we're supposed to
pour it on the plants.

25:34.141 --> 25:36.535
It makes sense
The plants are
what's withered.

25:36.622 --> 25:39.015
It's cedronian, though.
There's gonna be a downside.

25:39.102 --> 25:40.930
A downside I'll be
happy to deal with

25:41.017 --> 25:42.410
once we have
our spices back.

25:48.590 --> 25:51.071
Okay.
This is it.

25:54.596 --> 25:55.771
Wait!

25:55.858 --> 25:57.556
I just realized.

25:57.643 --> 26:00.254
Cedronian magic
is one to one.

26:00.341 --> 26:01.560
If we're bringing
something back

26:01.647 --> 26:04.084
as important as
the spice garden,

26:04.171 --> 26:08.088
we're going to lose something
equally as important.

26:08.175 --> 26:09.263
The book.

26:10.307 --> 26:11.570
It doesn't matter.

26:11.657 --> 26:14.094
Our job is to make sure
the magic lives on.

26:14.181 --> 26:15.617
I agree.

26:15.704 --> 26:18.141
The magic has to
keep going.

26:18.228 --> 26:20.709
Even if that means
the book moves on to

26:20.796 --> 26:23.451
a new trio
of protectors.

26:23.538 --> 26:25.627
We'll be okay.
No matter what.
