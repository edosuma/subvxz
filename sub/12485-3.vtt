00:08.220 --> 00:10.450
Wow, we're going to put on a great dance.

00:10.490 --> 00:12.420
This donation box is really full.

00:13.460 --> 00:15.160
Yeah.
Beep.

00:15.190 --> 00:18.190
Beep. Beep. Beep.

00:18.230 --> 00:19.360
What are you doing?

00:19.400 --> 00:22.260
I'm letting the traffic know
I'm going in reverse.

00:22.300 --> 00:24.000
What traffic?

00:24.030 --> 00:26.130
The other giant boxes
moving down the hallway?

00:29.140 --> 00:30.370
What's the matter with you?

00:30.410 --> 00:32.210
My box had the right of way!

00:33.480 --> 00:35.280
What's in there, your ego?

00:37.280 --> 00:42.020
I'll have you know, this box
is from a clothing drive.

00:42.050 --> 00:44.520
I had my dad drive me to the
mall and buy me clothing.

00:46.420 --> 00:48.320
Well, if you have any change left over,

00:48.360 --> 00:50.330
would you like to donate
to the dance committee?

00:50.360 --> 00:53.160
The only thing I'm going to
donate to the dance committee

00:53.200 --> 00:54.530
is this friendly advice.

00:55.460 --> 00:59.130
Don't mess it up!

00:59.170 --> 01:03.300
Don't worry, with us in charge,
it will be ANT-tastic!

01:07.110 --> 01:09.980
You' right, that sounds stupid.

01:10.010 --> 01:12.280
Good thing we didn't print
it on 2,000 posters.

01:17.390 --> 01:20.190
Okay, let's see how much we raised.

01:21.060 --> 01:22.120
Ah!
Ah!

01:24.160 --> 01:26.030
What are you doing in there?

01:26.060 --> 01:28.030
I'm afraid Violet's going
to ask me to the dance,

01:28.060 --> 01:32.130
so I've been
for a week. Ere

01:32.170 --> 01:35.170
Fletcher, this is our donation
box, not your panic room.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.040
I think you've to know thatg enough

01:37.070 --> 01:39.210
any room I'm in
a panic room. Lly.

01:41.110 --> 01:43.110
Ooh, here's 11 bucks.

01:43.150 --> 01:44.280
Hey, that's my wallet!

01:44.310 --> 01:45.350
Too bad.
It was in the box.

01:45.380 --> 01:46.380
Yeah.

Well, the only thing we
collected for the dance

02:44.070 --> 02:45.410
is the stuff in Fletcher's wallet.

02:45.440 --> 02:49.380
$11 and his immunization card.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.180
Your mother takes you to a vet?

02:54.380 --> 02:56.120
I've never had fleas.

02:57.390 --> 03:00.290
And if I behave,
these cookies.s me.

03:04.090 --> 03:05.960
Well, I hope we have enough money for a DJ.

03:05.990 --> 03:08.330
Because my first a great opportunitys

03:08.360 --> 03:09.960
to bust out my moves.

03:12.430 --> 03:14.970
Fletchie! There you are!
Think fast!

03:17.240 --> 03:19.040
Ow! What was that for?

03:19.070 --> 03:20.310
Look at what's on the ball.

03:20.340 --> 03:21.940
My blood?

03:23.180 --> 03:24.380
No, silly. A note.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.320
"Will you go to
the dance with me?"

03:28.350 --> 03:31.990
I'd love to go to
Fletchie! With you,

03:32.020 --> 03:34.990
What? No.
To the dance you

03:35.960 --> 03:36.960
because...

03:37.930 --> 03:39.260
I already told Chyna I'd go with her.

03:41.260 --> 03:42.960
When did that happen?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.270
Yeah, when did that happen?

03:46.030 --> 03:47.340
She had been begging me for days,

03:47.370 --> 03:50.340
and the truth is,
for her. Little sorry.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.310
Right.
That's what happened.

03:58.350 --> 04:00.010
Thank you, Fletcher,

04:00.050 --> 04:04.350
for taking pity on someone
as desperate as I am.

04:04.390 --> 04:08.960
You can have any girl in the
school, and you choose Chyna?

04:16.930 --> 04:18.329
Thank you.
You saved my life.

04:18.370 --> 04:19.970
No problem.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.040
As long as it's clear
we're just going as friends.

04:23.070 --> 04:24.940
Of course.
Friends it is.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.910
Boyfriend and girlfriend.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.250
So, Cameron, the dance is coming up.

04:37.290 --> 04:39.090
Yes, I'll go with you!

04:40.320 --> 04:42.220
I'm not asking you on a date.

04:42.260 --> 04:44.190
I just brought up the dance

04:44.230 --> 04:47.130
so I could brag how I've already
been invited by 27 different boys,

04:47.160 --> 04:50.000
including the captain of the debate team.

04:50.030 --> 04:53.270
He's not that cute,
but he talked me into it.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.350
Hi, I'm Jeanne Gossamer.

05:07.150 --> 05:08.920
I'm new here.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.090
Is there somewhere specific I should sit?

05:20.900 --> 05:22.100
What's wrong with you?

05:35.040 --> 05:37.080
Chyna, I know how much
this dance means to you,

05:37.110 --> 05:38.210
this being our first date and all...

05:38.250 --> 05:41.180
It's not a date.
I'm just doing you a favor.

05:41.220 --> 05:44.290
I know that.
I just say it for Violet's benefit.

05:46.150 --> 05:47.190
She's not here.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.020
Huh. So she isn't.

05:50.060 --> 05:54.060
The point is, I've solved
all of our money problems!

05:54.100 --> 05:57.330
I got us one billion dollars!

05:58.930 --> 06:00.070
Nice try, Fletcher.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.170
But you're not going to fool anyone

06:01.200 --> 06:02.340
with a bill that has Chyna's face on it.

06:06.140 --> 06:09.180
Hmm, I look good in a powdered wig.

06:12.350 --> 06:14.980
Your work is really good.

06:15.020 --> 06:17.320
Maybe we could raise enough
money to throw an awesome dance

06:17.350 --> 06:19.890
if we auctioned off some of your paintings.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.190
Great idea.

06:21.220 --> 06:23.860
I've got some terrific new pieces
I'm sure people will love.

06:23.890 --> 06:25.330
Including this one,

06:25.790 --> 06:30.210
entitled <i>Fletcher's</i> <i>Legitimate
Date</i> <i>to the Dance.</i>

06:38.520 --> 06:41.520
Lexi, can I ask you a question?

06:41.550 --> 06:43.450
The answer is dolphin milk.

06:46.660 --> 06:48.260
What?

06:48.290 --> 06:49.460
I'm sorry.

06:49.490 --> 06:51.230
I thought the question was going to be,

06:51.260 --> 06:53.260
"How do you get your hair so
lustrous and full of body?"

06:58.570 --> 07:00.300
I need your help.

07:00.340 --> 07:02.670
How can I get a beautiful girl
to go to the dance with me?

07:03.710 --> 07:06.480
Go to the beach.
Find an old lamp.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.640
Rub it and hope a genie comes
out and offers you a wish.

07:10.610 --> 07:12.580
Don't you think I've tried that?

07:15.420 --> 07:18.420
I'm sorry, Cameron, but the
only time a beautiful girl

07:18.450 --> 07:21.660
falls for a guy like you is in the movies.

07:21.690 --> 07:24.290
But I have a huge crush
on that new student, Jeanne,

07:24.330 --> 07:25.660
who is the prettiest girl
I've ever seen by far, and...

07:25.700 --> 07:27.600
Whoa. Slow down.

07:30.330 --> 07:32.430
I don't know who this Jeanne is,

07:32.470 --> 07:35.470
but obviously she's not the
prettiest girl you've ever seen,

07:35.510 --> 07:37.240
because you've seen <i>moi.</i>

07:38.340 --> 07:39.510
<i>"Moi"?</i>

07:39.540 --> 07:42.310
That foreign exchange student from Korea?

07:42.350 --> 07:44.710
He's nice and all,
but Jeanne's more my type.

07:51.490 --> 07:53.360
Welcome to the Fletcher Quimby auction.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.560
Now before we start the bidding,

07:54.590 --> 07:56.430
I left my lunch money at home,

07:56.460 --> 07:59.660
so who can lend me $5, $5.
$10, $10. A $10?

07:59.700 --> 08:01.530
Olive!

08:01.560 --> 08:04.670
This is terrible.
There's only one person here.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.370
And Wacky's not going to buy anything.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.440
He spent all his money on sheep's clothing.

08:11.570 --> 08:13.440
I can't believe no one's
interested in my art.

08:14.310 --> 08:16.280
I'm a complete failure.

08:16.310 --> 08:17.610
Sorry I let everyone down.

08:17.650 --> 08:19.510
That's okay.
We're used to it.

08:22.450 --> 08:24.550
This is a disaster.

08:24.590 --> 08:28.220
We have no money and the
dance is in three days!

08:28.260 --> 08:30.660
What if we push
three days to...rom.

08:30.690 --> 08:32.360
Four days, four days, do I hear five days?

08:32.400 --> 08:34.630
Five days.
Five going once...

08:34.659 --> 08:37.630
Is this the Fletcher Quimby art auction?

08:38.640 --> 08:39.669
Yes.

08:39.700 --> 08:44.410
I am Gnocchi, perfumer to the stars.

08:44.440 --> 08:49.580
I design signature scents
for all the celebrities.

08:49.610 --> 08:51.550
What does this smell like?

08:53.550 --> 08:55.480
It smells like

08:55.520 --> 08:57.490
corduroy and beard sweat.

08:58.520 --> 09:01.420
It's one of my
best-selling colognes.

09:01.460 --> 09:03.260
Galifianakis!

09:04.360 --> 09:06.190
Is good, yes, no?

09:07.600 --> 09:09.530
So, you're interested in Fletcher's art?

09:09.570 --> 09:13.300
Yes, I saw the preview
of your auction online

09:13.340 --> 09:17.440
and his paintings, they spoke to me.

09:17.470 --> 09:19.410
Literally, I heard them talk.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.550
To be fair, I was in perfume factory

09:23.580 --> 09:26.380
surrounded by a lot of weird chemicals.

09:28.420 --> 09:30.250
I'd love to meet this artist.

09:30.290 --> 09:31.490
He's here, yes, no?

09:33.260 --> 09:34.590
Unfortunately, you're too late.

09:35.530 --> 09:37.330
Fletcher's gone.

09:37.360 --> 09:41.260
Yeah. He was here one minute and
then just like that, he left us.

09:41.300 --> 09:45.370
Oh, no!
He's no longer with us?

09:45.400 --> 09:47.240
I'm afraid not.

09:47.270 --> 09:49.400
I'm so sorry for your loss.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.570
You have my condolences.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.280
What? No.
We didn't mean that he was...

09:56.310 --> 09:57.680
Wait a minute.

09:57.710 --> 10:02.250
If he's dead, his artwork
will skyrocket in value.

10:02.290 --> 10:04.220
Are there any unsold paintings?

10:04.250 --> 10:05.650
I'll pay top dollar!

10:08.560 --> 10:11.260
Awesome!

10:11.290 --> 10:14.660
Uh, I mean, Fletcher would
have wanted it that way.

10:19.470 --> 10:21.570
Hey, Cameron.
What's with the outfit?

10:24.610 --> 10:28.340
Is it so you can tell the teacher
that you ate your own homework?

10:28.380 --> 10:29.750
You don't think I've tried that?

10:32.550 --> 10:34.450
But this is for something different.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.720
I thought about what you said,

10:35.750 --> 10:39.250
how guys like me only get
beautiful girls in the movies.

10:39.290 --> 10:43.490
So I'm acting out a scene from one of
the most romantic movies of all time.

10:43.530 --> 10:45.490
I think.
I only watch cartoons.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.330
Oh!

10:50.370 --> 10:51.400
Would you like to sit down?

10:55.300 --> 10:57.510
I don't believe we've officially met.

10:57.540 --> 10:59.310
I'm Cameron.

10:59.340 --> 11:01.380
I'm glad you can say more than...

11:04.710 --> 11:06.380
Would you like a meatball?

11:06.420 --> 11:07.480
Thank you.

11:10.590 --> 11:12.490
How romantic.

11:12.520 --> 11:16.660
Not very sanitary, but romantic.

11:16.690 --> 11:20.260
If you like romance, how about
going to the dance with me?

11:20.730 --> 11:22.300
I'd love to.

11:49.730 --> 11:52.660
Wow!
The dance looks amazing.

11:52.700 --> 11:55.530
I still can't believe anyone
was interested in my art.

11:55.570 --> 11:57.630
Well, you're an incredible artist.

11:57.670 --> 12:00.340
This guy Gnocchi wanted to buy everything.

12:00.370 --> 12:02.670
Yeah, once he found out you were dead.

12:02.710 --> 12:04.310
What?

12:04.670 --> 12:06.480
Uh, yes.

12:06.510 --> 12:09.680
Dead...icated to your art.

12:09.710 --> 12:12.280
Olive, use the whole word next time.

12:12.320 --> 12:13.650
You kids and your text speak.

12:18.590 --> 12:21.390
Hey, Cameron, do you
want your picture taken?

12:21.420 --> 12:24.530
Of course. I want a lasting
memory of this night,

12:24.560 --> 12:27.660
which I will treasure until the day I die.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.660
Okay. I don't want to
hear your life story.

12:29.700 --> 12:32.470
I'm only doing this to spend
time with Baby Boo Boo.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.300
Ow!

12:50.290 --> 12:51.650
What's wrong?

12:51.690 --> 12:54.520
You think it's odd I have a
date who looks like this?

12:55.590 --> 12:58.330
Nope. This doesn't
surprise me at all.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.600
Nice job planning the dance, Chyna!

13:04.630 --> 13:07.600
Wait. Was that, "Nice job
planning the dance, Chyna"

13:07.640 --> 13:10.540
or, "Nice job planning the dance, Chyna"?

13:12.380 --> 13:13.710
I didn't hear any difference.

13:15.310 --> 13:17.310
But everyone's having a great time.

13:17.350 --> 13:19.210
At least my dates are.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.550
Your turn, number eleven!

13:24.620 --> 13:27.490
Chyna, we should probably dance.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.390
Not because it's something I've envisioned

13:29.430 --> 13:33.430
since the day I laid eyes on
you, but for Violet's sake.

13:33.460 --> 13:34.600
Maybe later.

13:34.630 --> 13:37.730
Come on.
Olive taught me some moves.

13:40.340 --> 13:42.470
Fletcher, this is a slow song.

13:42.510 --> 13:43.640
Even better.

13:47.640 --> 13:51.280
Wait, what's that smell?

13:51.310 --> 13:53.580
Sorry, I sweat when I'm nervous.

13:53.620 --> 13:55.520
No. I smell...

13:57.320 --> 13:58.390
Galifianakis!

14:01.930 --> 14:04.460
Oh, no.

14:12.570 --> 14:14.130
Gnocchi's here!

14:14.170 --> 14:16.100
I know.

14:16.140 --> 14:19.100
And if he sees Fletcher, we
could go to jail for fraud!

14:19.140 --> 14:20.370
I won't last a day in prison!

14:20.410 --> 14:24.180
On average, their libraries
only have like 20,000 books!

14:25.340 --> 14:27.410
What is going on?

14:27.450 --> 14:30.120
Look, the guy who
bought all your paintings,

14:30.150 --> 14:32.120
we may have accidentally
given him the impression

14:32.150 --> 14:33.290
that you were dead.

14:34.190 --> 14:35.220
You what?

14:35.250 --> 14:37.220
Look, I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you,

14:37.260 --> 14:38.360
but he cannot know you're alive!

14:38.390 --> 14:39.590
So, go hide! Go!

14:39.630 --> 14:40.630
Okay!

14:43.260 --> 14:46.500
Hey, Gnocchi!

14:46.530 --> 14:48.500
How nice to smell you again!

14:49.440 --> 14:51.270
What are you doing here?

14:51.300 --> 14:55.270
I stopped by because I figured the
school might want this painting,

14:55.310 --> 14:57.110
to remember Fletcher by.

14:57.140 --> 15:00.150
It's his self-portrait,
which he titled.

15:00.180 --> 15:02.280
<i>The Man</i>
<i>of Chyna's Dreams.</i>

15:04.250 --> 15:05.480
Wacky, I need your head!

15:09.260 --> 15:13.090
That shrieking boy,
that is Quimby, yes, no?

15:13.130 --> 15:16.460
No, no. That's a Quimby,
but that's not Fletcher.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.530
That's his long lost twin.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.500
Javier.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.070
From Spain.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.340
Say <i>hol</i> Javier.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.170
Uh...

15:27.210 --> 15:30.080
<i>Si, si.</i>
<i>Hola...mademoiselle.</i>

15:32.380 --> 15:36.380
I read about the loss of my brother
and wanted to pay my respects,

15:36.420 --> 15:39.480
so I traveled all the way across

15:39.520 --> 15:41.520
the Spanish-American
land bridge.

15:48.430 --> 15:52.360
Taquito. Burrito. <i>Ole.</i>

15:55.430 --> 15:58.370
Something does not smell right.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.340
And it's not just my newest
cologne, "Hasselhoff!"

16:04.410 --> 16:08.250
Okay. This is not Fletcher's
long lost twin from Spain.

16:08.280 --> 16:10.220
Why he couldn't have had a
long lost twin from Cleveland,

16:10.250 --> 16:11.350
we'll never know.

16:12.420 --> 16:15.090
You deceived me.

16:15.120 --> 16:20.330
I want my money back
or I will call the police.

16:20.360 --> 16:23.230
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Okay.
I'm sorry we lied to you,

16:23.260 --> 16:25.260
but maybe we can work something out.

16:25.300 --> 16:27.500
Yeah. Like what if
Fletcher here were to

16:27.530 --> 16:30.240
meet with an unfortunate accident?

16:30.270 --> 16:33.440
You keep your paintings, we
keep our money, everyone wins.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.470
Not everyone!

16:35.510 --> 16:38.440
That's it, you're going to prison

16:38.480 --> 16:41.350
and they're going to throw away the key.

16:43.280 --> 16:45.520
Actually, most modern
prisons have abandoned keys

16:45.550 --> 16:47.450
in favor of electronic locking systems.

16:49.290 --> 16:50.320
Hey.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.320
Zach Galifianakis!

16:54.290 --> 16:57.200
Yes, it is I.

16:57.230 --> 16:59.500
You look much smaller in person.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.330
The magic of the movies.

17:02.370 --> 17:06.000
Bradley Cooper can fit in a tea cup.

17:06.040 --> 17:10.339
Are you here because I used your
scent without your permission?

17:11.109 --> 17:12.140
Um...

17:12.180 --> 17:13.180
Yes.

17:15.079 --> 17:17.220
And I'm gonna make sure
they put you in jail

17:17.250 --> 17:19.420
and throw away the
electronic locking system.

17:21.190 --> 17:23.119
I'll be ruined!

17:23.160 --> 17:26.260
I will have to go back
to recording audio books!

17:28.390 --> 17:29.460
Come...

17:29.500 --> 17:33.060
You know, I'm good friends
with Zach Galifianakis,

17:33.100 --> 17:36.030
so I'm sure that if you drop
your complaint with us,

17:36.070 --> 17:38.300
I can get him to drop
his complaint with you.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.110
Never!

17:42.140 --> 17:43.210
Do something!

17:46.450 --> 17:48.180
I have been convinced!

17:49.350 --> 17:53.380
Fine.
You win this round!

17:53.420 --> 17:58.520
But this is the only round,
so I guess it's over.

18:01.390 --> 18:03.430
That was great!

18:03.460 --> 18:06.130
Angus, you totally bailed us out.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.430
How'd you come up with this plan?

18:07.470 --> 18:10.240
What plan? I just pretend
to be Zach Galifianakis

18:10.270 --> 18:12.300
because it drives the ladies crazy.

18:14.340 --> 18:16.470
You'll never believe what she promised me.

18:17.340 --> 18:18.340
Olive.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.360
Jeanne, you want to dance?

18:31.390 --> 18:33.190
My bunion is healing nicely,

18:33.230 --> 18:36.190
and I'm about 40% sure it's not infected.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.400
How are you still single?

19:03.190 --> 19:06.020
I cannot believe what I'm seeing.

19:06.060 --> 19:08.360
Lexi Reed, this is Jeanne Gossamer.

19:08.390 --> 19:11.360
See?
I told you she was beautiful.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.260
Who are you talking about?

19:13.300 --> 19:15.400
I'm talking about Jeanne, my date.

19:17.070 --> 19:19.070
What date?
There's no one there.

19:20.140 --> 19:22.340
Wow, talk about denial.

19:23.340 --> 19:25.240
Cameron, your photos are ready.

19:29.450 --> 19:31.220
I don't understand.

19:31.250 --> 19:33.420
Why is Jeanne not in the pictures?

19:33.450 --> 19:35.120
Why are you not in the...

19:54.370 --> 19:56.240
What's wrong?

19:56.280 --> 19:58.340
You think it's weird
I have a date like this?

20:00.210 --> 20:02.280
Nope. This doesn't
surprise me at all.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.430
What's wrong with you?

20:24.540 --> 20:28.310
But Jeanne came into the classroom.

20:28.340 --> 20:30.280
I remember you were reading that catalog.

20:37.350 --> 20:39.350
She was never there?

20:39.390 --> 20:42.390
I knew there was no girl in
this school prettier than me!

20:42.420 --> 20:44.090
It defies all logic!

20:45.220 --> 20:46.420
How could this be?

20:47.260 --> 20:49.130
You imagined her.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.330
Obviously you couldn't
handle the grim reality

20:51.360 --> 20:53.300
that you'd never have a date for the dance,

20:53.330 --> 20:55.170
so your sub-conscious
invented a date

20:55.200 --> 20:57.570
to protect what tiny shred
of self-worth you have.

21:02.110 --> 21:03.240
Just ignore them, Cameron.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.510
Why? Are they
also imaginary?

21:12.380 --> 21:16.050
Look, so Cameron's here alone.
Big deal.

21:16.090 --> 21:18.390
You don't need a girlfriend or a boyfriend

21:18.420 --> 21:21.290
or 27 boyfriends to have a good time.

21:22.330 --> 21:24.060
In fact...

21:24.100 --> 21:25.460
She's going to sing, isn't she?

Chyna, I really liked
the message in your song.

22:47.300 --> 22:49.949
You don't need a boyfriend to be happy.

22:49.950 --> 22:51.780
But I do.

22:55.680 --> 22:58.969
Thanks for that, Chyna. I'm very appreciate it.

22:58.970 --> 23:00.710
Anytime.

23:02.740 --> 23:05.509
What's wrong? You still seem upset.

23:05.510 --> 23:08.969
Yeah. Because the worst part of this whole thing is

23:08.970 --> 23:11.560
I payed for 2 tickets to the dance.

23:12.020 --> 23:13.930
No refund.
