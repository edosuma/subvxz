Previously, on <i>Smash...</i>

00:04.932 --> 00:06.814
This isn't a high school
science project,

00:06.866 --> 00:08.551
it's a bloody musical.

00:08.585 --> 00:10.519
We're looking at someone else
for press secretary.

00:10.554 --> 00:12.555
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Karen, this is R.J.

00:12.606 --> 00:14.490
<i>New York Times</i> reporter
I'm always complaining about.

00:14.558 --> 00:16.309
I kinda got arrested.

00:16.343 --> 00:17.727
My workshop is tomorrow.

00:17.778 --> 00:19.278
You know what
I'm in the middle of!

00:19.313 --> 00:21.113
I do know what
you're in the middle of.

00:21.148 --> 00:23.733
- Ivy was incredible.
- I don't know about incredible.

00:23.767 --> 00:25.701
Get your head
in the game.

♪ On Lexington
and 52nd Street ♪

00:27.521 --> 00:29.438
I think the real problem
is Michael Swift.

00:29.490 --> 00:30.890
Okay, do you want
to fix the show,

00:30.908 --> 00:32.091
or indulge
in paranoid fantasies?

00:32.125 --> 00:33.459
We need to rethink
some things.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.417
Joe, that's perfect.

00:41.451 --> 00:42.618
So you haven't
heard any feedback?

00:42.669 --> 00:43.953
It's only been
a few days.

00:44.004 --> 00:45.404
More like a week, guy.

00:45.422 --> 00:47.006
Well, there's always
radio silence

00:47.040 --> 00:48.908
while they figure out
the next step.

00:48.926 --> 00:51.744
I'm sure I'll hear
something soon.

00:51.762 --> 00:55.464
You don't think it's dead,
do you?

00:55.516 --> 00:57.633
- We're dead.
- Stop.

00:57.684 --> 00:59.268
Eileen is not returning
my phone calls.

00:59.303 --> 01:02.188
She will call you when she has
something to tell you.

01:02.222 --> 01:04.105
I hate show business.

01:04.141 --> 01:05.775
You work with people,
day in, day out,

01:05.809 --> 01:07.593
putting your soul
on the line,

01:07.611 --> 01:10.313
and the instant things
don't go the way you want,

01:10.364 --> 01:12.932
it's as if you've
evaporated off the planet.

01:12.966 --> 01:15.768
Julia, the workshop
was a success.

01:15.786 --> 01:17.153
Are you ready
to go to Broadway? No.

01:17.204 --> 01:19.522
But as a first step,
it was a success.

01:19.556 --> 01:21.607
- I hate first steps.
- I know.

01:21.625 --> 01:22.808
I want to be there.

01:22.843 --> 01:25.611
I know.

01:25.629 --> 01:26.829
And now we have
Leo's court date.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.447
Don't think about it.

01:28.465 --> 01:29.832
It's next week.
We have to think about it.

01:29.883 --> 01:33.135
Not right this second
we don't.

01:34.588 --> 01:36.956
What're you
doing now, Frank?

01:36.974 --> 01:40.643
You're a musical theater star.
I'm going to sing to you.

02:18.048 --> 02:20.016
Good.

02:20.050 --> 02:22.518
Okay, I'll book a space.
Thanks, Derek.

02:24.187 --> 02:25.521
Door was open.

02:25.555 --> 02:26.889
So I see.

02:26.940 --> 02:28.224
I called your office,
they said you were

02:28.275 --> 02:31.560
working from here
for a couple days.

02:31.612 --> 02:35.114
One of those useless temps
actually showed up?

02:35.148 --> 02:38.367
That's novel.

02:38.402 --> 02:40.686
You need any help
with anything?

02:40.704 --> 02:41.723
Now that the workshop's over,

02:41.724 --> 02:43.022
Tom doesn't really need me as much.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.373
I've got some extra time.

02:44.408 --> 02:46.692
You're such
a useful young man.

02:46.710 --> 02:48.527
I try to be.

02:48.545 --> 02:50.913
Want me to call the movers, see
when your stuff's getting here?

02:50.964 --> 02:54.300
No, actually, I don't want
any of that old stuff.

02:54.334 --> 02:56.135
No?

02:56.169 --> 02:57.870
No, I think
it's pretty like this.

02:57.904 --> 03:00.539
It's airy. Light.

03:00.557 --> 03:02.591
Yeah, but it echoes.

03:02.643 --> 03:03.450
If you don't mind,

03:03.451 --> 03:05.428
would you help me with a
couple of things here?

03:05.479 --> 03:06.479
Yeah, sure.

03:06.513 --> 03:09.899
Come in. It's open.

03:09.933 --> 03:12.051
Hi. Can I help you?

03:12.069 --> 03:15.571
Mom?

03:19.443 --> 03:23.446
- Did you bring your demo?
- Yeah. Yes, I did.

03:23.497 --> 03:25.831
You said you wanted
to talk about <i>Marilyn?</i>

03:25.866 --> 03:27.950
Yeah, I did.

03:28.001 --> 03:32.171
We've come up with a really
interesting new situation,

03:32.205 --> 03:34.239
and we're talking
to a new songwriter.

03:34.257 --> 03:37.176
- A new songwriter.
- MmAbout a new approach.

03:37.210 --> 03:39.679
And one new song,
actually, to start.

03:39.713 --> 03:40.913
Okay, so...

03:40.931 --> 03:42.848
And we need you
to sing it.

03:42.883 --> 03:44.767
You want me to s...

03:44.801 --> 03:49.805

obviously, cannot know.

s01 ep 08 - The Coup

03:57.126 --> 04:00.626
sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

04:05.315 --> 04:07.007
So what did she said
when you give it to her?

04:07.008 --> 04:09.491
- She didn't say anything.
- She just took it.

04:09.543 --> 04:10.910
She looked at it.

04:10.961 --> 04:12.712
And what did she say
when you asked her

04:12.746 --> 04:13.796
about what was happening?

04:13.830 --> 04:15.030
She didn't say anything.

04:15.048 --> 04:17.533
That's great.

04:17.551 --> 04:19.851
Like, nothing?
She literally said nothing.

04:19.886 --> 04:21.070
Well, her daughter
showed up.

04:21.103 --> 04:22.705
Katie's in town.

04:22.723 --> 04:24.540
"Mahatma Katie."
That's what she called her.

04:24.558 --> 04:26.875
For good reason.
That girl is a Saint.

04:26.893 --> 04:28.561
She was on the phone
with Derek when I got there,

04:28.595 --> 04:30.212
something about
Karen Cartwright.

04:30.230 --> 04:34.583
She and Derek were
talking about Karen?

04:34.618 --> 04:36.051
That's what I heard.

04:36.069 --> 04:38.904
I wonder what that's about.

04:38.939 --> 04:43.909
Here, tomorrow you can
deliver this.

04:43.944 --> 04:47.780
Call Julia.

04:52.753 --> 04:55.588
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for calling me.

05:02.879 --> 05:05.598
So, I,

05:05.632 --> 05:08.083
How's your family?

05:08.101 --> 05:10.186
They're good.
They're right over there.

05:10.220 --> 05:11.303
They are?

05:11.355 --> 05:14.690
- Go on.
- They are!

05:14.725 --> 05:16.809
Good. Good.

05:21.565 --> 05:22.698
And Frank and Leo?

05:22.733 --> 05:24.567
They're good.

05:28.739 --> 05:32.158
I did want
to tell you,

05:32.209 --> 05:35.661
We don't know what's
happening with <i>Marilyn,</i> but...

05:35.712 --> 05:39.615
I'm fired.

05:39.633 --> 05:41.333
It's okay,

05:41.385 --> 05:44.470
If I weren't fired,
I'd quit.

05:46.139 --> 05:48.841
They're everything to me,

05:48.892 --> 05:53.062

06:23.126 --> 06:25.327
So Tom and Julia
know nothing about it?

06:25.345 --> 06:27.179
Apparently not, and I'm not
supposed to tell them.

06:27.214 --> 06:29.515
I'm supposed to just show up
and sing a song

06:29.549 --> 06:31.217
that someone else wrote
for their musical.

06:31.268 --> 06:32.852
Are they even
allowed to do that?

06:32.886 --> 06:34.553
Who knows?
I can't figure these people out.

06:34.604 --> 06:36.939
Seriously, your lot
is as bad as my lot.

06:36.973 --> 06:38.357
- And my lot are politicians.
- Right?

06:38.391 --> 06:40.526
And he kept saying "we."
Like, who is "we"?

06:40.560 --> 06:43.195
Well, if it's not Tom and
Julia, it must be the producer.

06:43.230 --> 06:45.013
Yeah, but he never said it,
he just kept saying, "we,"

06:45.031 --> 06:48.367
like a giant "we,"
like gods or aliens.

06:48.401 --> 06:50.736
Is that cardamom in the shell?

06:50.787 --> 06:52.288
Where'd you find this?

06:52.322 --> 06:54.623
I had to meet him
way at the end of 2nd ave,

06:54.658 --> 06:56.191
because we were
being so secret,

06:56.209 --> 06:59.245
so I stopped
at an Indian market.

06:59.296 --> 07:01.547
I'm gonna make curry.

07:01.581 --> 07:03.031
No. Hon...

07:03.049 --> 07:04.032
No, you have to
at least let me try.

07:04.050 --> 07:04.933
I mean, seriously,

07:04.934 --> 07:07.386
I can do more than corn
on the cob and hot dogs.

07:07.420 --> 07:09.388
No, no, it's not that.
I'm not in tonight.

07:09.422 --> 07:10.756
I have a dinner with R.J.

07:10.807 --> 07:12.424
She's doing
some research for me.

07:12.476 --> 07:15.261
In other words, she's
digging up dirt on Paul Nemesis.

07:15.312 --> 07:17.212
You know,
it's all politics.

07:17.230 --> 07:19.682
I... mm...

07:23.937 --> 07:26.221
Denby's not even
press secretary yet.

07:26.239 --> 07:28.223
But he might as well be,
the way everyone's treating him.

07:28.241 --> 07:31.076
What would you say
if I told you I have something?

07:31.111 --> 07:34.497
I'd say, "fork it over.
Now. Yesterday."

07:34.531 --> 07:37.900
Okay, when Denby
was down in D.C.,

07:37.918 --> 07:40.286
he met the mayor's daughter
at some benefit.

07:40.337 --> 07:44.140
He tried to woo her with some
Anthony Weiner-style photos.

07:44.174 --> 07:46.258
Classy, eh?

07:46.293 --> 07:48.444
You're welcome.
I'll let you leak it.

07:48.478 --> 07:51.797
Uhis that
a conscience I see?

07:55.051 --> 07:56.302
Sorry.

07:58.972 --> 08:02.191
That's so pretty.

08:10.150 --> 08:12.368
You know, mom...

08:12.402 --> 08:14.620
He sent me all this money.

08:14.654 --> 08:17.105
I was out
in the middle of India,

08:17.123 --> 08:18.791
and all of a sudden
this Fed Ex truck shows up

08:18.825 --> 08:22.044
with all these
legal docs, and...

08:22.078 --> 08:25.998
Dad put, like, a ton of money
into my trust fund.

08:26.049 --> 08:28.334
Of course he did.

08:28.385 --> 08:30.636
It's why I came home.

08:30.670 --> 08:33.672
I knew that when
all of that money showed up,

08:33.722 --> 08:36.625
he had to be
messing with you.

08:36.643 --> 08:41.630
So, uh, give me a call
when you get a minute, okay?

08:41.648 --> 08:43.616
I love you.

08:43.650 --> 08:45.117
She's still
not picking up.

08:53.660 --> 08:55.494
"Loitering for drugs,"
the more serious of the charges,

08:55.528 --> 08:57.246
we got dismissed.

08:57.280 --> 09:01.834
The only charge outstanding
is "failure to obey park signs."

09:01.868 --> 09:03.335
What was the sign again?

09:03.370 --> 09:05.504
It said,
"please don't walk over here,

09:05.538 --> 09:08.040
because the grass
has been reseeded."

09:08.091 --> 09:10.342
- Were you walking there?
- No, I wasn't walking there.

09:10.377 --> 09:13.161
It was way over,
like, way over there.

09:13.179 --> 09:15.664
So you were actually
obeying the park signs?

09:15.682 --> 09:17.332
My point being,

09:17.350 --> 09:20.686
this seems so minor,
why don't we just pay the fine?

09:20.720 --> 09:22.283
You want to get the
charges dismissed

09:22.284 --> 09:23.338
so the record is expunged.

09:23.356 --> 09:25.891
Otherwise, he has to admit it
on college applications.

09:25.942 --> 09:27.359
Walking on the grass.

09:27.394 --> 09:28.944
Which he didn't even do.

09:28.979 --> 09:31.196
You have a summons,
and you have to answer it.

09:31.231 --> 09:32.998
Welcome to
the legal system.

09:33.033 --> 09:34.850
I'll do the talking.

09:34.868 --> 09:38.370
We'll all be polite,
and this will all go away.

09:38.405 --> 09:41.073
There you are.

09:41.124 --> 09:43.375
I'm really glad
you're on board for this.

09:43.410 --> 09:45.544
I'm not, actually.

09:45.578 --> 09:47.079
I've really been thinking,

09:47.130 --> 09:49.632
and I'm not comfortable
with this arrangement.

09:49.666 --> 09:51.033
And what is
the arrangement?

09:51.051 --> 09:52.217
I don't know.

09:52.252 --> 09:53.702
Well, then,
how can you be

09:53.720 --> 09:55.203
so sure you're not
comfortable with it?

09:55.221 --> 09:57.706
Julia has been
so kind to me.

09:57.724 --> 09:59.224
Yes, she has.

09:59.259 --> 10:01.710
But I don't see
how that's relevant.

10:01.728 --> 10:04.379
- Well, you told me not to call her.
- No, I didn't.

10:04.397 --> 10:06.315
I just said that she and Tom
couldn't know about it.

10:06.349 --> 10:08.600
But why not?

10:08.652 --> 10:09.935
Okay.

10:09.986 --> 10:12.321
As a general rule,

10:12.355 --> 10:15.724
composers tend to flip out
at the drop of a hat.

10:15.742 --> 10:19.111
So until I know
what I want to tell them,

10:19.162 --> 10:20.913
I don't want
to tell them anything.

10:20.947 --> 10:23.415
What're you doing?

10:23.450 --> 10:27.619
There's only one way
to find out.

10:30.457 --> 10:32.007
A friend of mine's doing
a show here at weekends,

10:32.042 --> 10:34.259
said we could
use the space.

10:34.294 --> 10:35.678
Some of the guys are gonna
help us stage it.

10:35.712 --> 10:39.014
One second, guys.

10:39.049 --> 10:40.415
You're Karen.

10:40.433 --> 10:42.184
My God.
You're Ryan Tedder.

10:42.218 --> 10:43.769
I heard your demo
for <i>Brighter than the sun.</i>

10:43.803 --> 10:45.420
Amazing.

10:45.438 --> 10:47.306
You have an incredible
set of pipes. I love your sound.

10:47.357 --> 10:50.776
Thanks. I'm... I'm such
a huge fan of one Republic.

10:50.810 --> 10:52.161
I'm such a dork.

10:52.195 --> 10:53.362
All right, let's get to it.

10:53.396 --> 10:54.396
Okay.

10:57.689 --> 11:00.189
So this young man was disobey the park's
signs?

11:00.244 --> 11:01.561
There is actually
no evidence of that.

11:01.596 --> 11:03.180
Then what're
we doing here?

11:03.231 --> 11:05.348
I might ask the court
the same question, your honor.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.283
You want to dismiss this,
or not?

11:07.318 --> 11:08.685
We want it dismissed.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.654
Do you want it dismissed,
young man?

11:10.688 --> 11:13.190
Yes, sir, your honor.

11:13.241 --> 11:16.326
Because I'm not interested
in handing out dismissals

11:16.360 --> 11:18.311
for ungrateful,
privileged kids

11:18.329 --> 11:20.813
who think they can get away with
murder in a public park!

11:20.832 --> 11:22.148
I'm sorry,
what did you say?

11:22.166 --> 11:24.701
- Julia...
- "Get away with murder"?

11:24.752 --> 11:27.921
My son was arrested.
He was handcuffed.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.489
And he did nothing wrong.

11:29.507 --> 11:32.058
Are we ungrateful for that?
Yes, we are.

11:32.093 --> 11:34.928
But we are grateful,
very, very grateful

11:34.962 --> 11:37.830
for the court's
patience and tolerance.

11:37.849 --> 11:39.165
Tolerance?

11:39.183 --> 11:40.400
I just think that...

11:40.434 --> 11:42.001
Honey, honey,
we know what you think.

11:42.019 --> 11:44.937
Yeah, so does the judge.
That was awesome.

11:45.023 --> 11:45.755
Let's keep moving.

11:45.756 --> 11:47.658
We have to get out of here
before they arrest her.

11:47.692 --> 11:49.076
Yeah,
for being ungrateful.

11:49.110 --> 11:51.814
I'm not ungrateful.

11:53.665 --> 11:58.169
I am so grateful.

12:02.919 --> 12:05.137
Let's get
some Chinese food.

12:09.259 --> 12:10.642
♪ Look at me, baby

12:16.766 --> 12:18.150
♪ wanna watch, baby

12:18.184 --> 12:21.570
♪ like a,
like a movie screen ♪

12:23.907 --> 12:25.741
♪ Gonna get what I want

12:25.775 --> 12:28.410
♪ want you on your knees

12:30.864 --> 12:32.564
♪ give it up, baby

12:35.118 --> 12:37.503
One second.

12:37.537 --> 12:38.811
So, we're thinking
about switching it up

12:38.812 --> 12:40.255
and going to e-flat in the
bridge, if that's cool.

12:40.290 --> 12:41.590
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:41.624 --> 12:43.125
- Okay.
- I think it'll sound cool.

12:43.176 --> 12:44.676
Actually, yeah, when you
get to "on your knees,"

12:44.711 --> 12:45.828
I think you're holding the note
for too long.

12:45.862 --> 12:47.179
Wait.

12:47.213 --> 12:48.263
Just back off
for one second, Derek.

12:48.298 --> 12:50.248
Yeah.
Back off, Derek.

12:50.266 --> 12:52.184
Look, I think
she sounds great,

12:52.218 --> 12:55.587
so let's not mess with it.

12:55.605 --> 12:57.255
This is a stupid idea.

12:57.273 --> 12:58.474
Well, for the moment,
it doesn't seem so good,

12:58.525 --> 12:59.775
but I know that
you both love me,

12:59.809 --> 13:01.193
and that you're
going to actually

13:01.227 --> 13:02.945
start trying,
for my sake, to be civil.

13:02.979 --> 13:05.864
When have I not
been civil?

13:05.899 --> 13:07.850
Dad, I can
personally name f...

13:07.884 --> 13:10.536
Six instances
in the past week!

13:10.570 --> 13:11.603
This money thing
is punitive.

13:11.621 --> 13:13.288
Mom needs money to live.

13:13.323 --> 13:16.542
She's producing a musical
about Marilyn Monroe.

13:16.576 --> 13:18.710
- She can live on that.
- She needs money now.

13:18.745 --> 13:21.279
I'm fine, and by the way,
I can speak for myself.

13:21.297 --> 13:23.165
Well, can you do that, please?
'Cause I'm not getting anywhere.

13:23.216 --> 13:24.800
I don't need his money.

13:24.834 --> 13:27.136
You're living in an apartment
with no furniture!

13:27.170 --> 13:29.972
- I'm happy that way!
- Good!

13:30.006 --> 13:33.625
And by the way, it's not
his money, it's my money!

13:33.643 --> 13:35.811
And it's not his business,
it's my business!

13:35.845 --> 13:38.630
'Cause he hasn't produced
a play in ten years!

13:38.648 --> 13:39.798
She's got a point, dad.

13:39.816 --> 13:41.466
- Really?
- Yes, really.

13:41.484 --> 13:43.452
And I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

13:43.486 --> 13:45.737
It's hideous that you've been
squeezing her on the money side,

13:45.772 --> 13:50.242
and then you oh, so cleverly put
$3 million into my trust fund?

13:50.276 --> 13:52.845
I really think that's
not very nice of you.

13:54.614 --> 13:58.700
Giving you $3 million
is not very nice?

13:58.751 --> 14:01.670
If you can give money to me,
you can give money to her.

14:01.704 --> 14:04.756
It's my family's money.
And you're my blood.

14:04.791 --> 14:06.992
My God.
Tell me you're kidding.

14:07.026 --> 14:09.178
I don't need your family's
stupid money!

14:09.212 --> 14:11.063
She stole the Degas!

14:11.097 --> 14:13.164
And pawned it
for this bloody musical!

14:13.183 --> 14:16.168
Did she tell you that?

14:16.202 --> 14:20.772
That's because you poisoned
my investors, you jackass!

14:20.807 --> 14:24.526
Can I help you?

14:28.731 --> 14:30.348
- Hello?
- Who's this?

14:30.366 --> 14:32.517
It's Ellis.
Eileen's in a meeting.

14:32.535 --> 14:33.518
Right, just tell her
it's all going well.

14:33.536 --> 14:35.120
We're on for tomorrow.

14:35.154 --> 14:37.039
Wait, is this that thing
you're doing with Karen?

14:37.073 --> 14:39.627
Just give her
the message, Ellis.

14:42.045 --> 14:44.696
Julia was so mad,

14:44.714 --> 14:47.249
she almost ruined
the whole thing.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.551
She's a lot of fun
when she's lit up.

14:49.586 --> 14:51.920
Thank you.

14:53.506 --> 14:56.725
Well?

14:56.759 --> 14:59.978
- Perfect.
- Great.

15:00.013 --> 15:02.814
Seriously.
Your tribe is hilarious.

15:02.849 --> 15:06.384
You guys really do
need to keep a lawyer around.

15:06.402 --> 15:10.405
I think so.

15:13.109 --> 15:15.611
- You really expect me to bowl?
- You're gonna love it.

15:15.662 --> 15:17.246
I've bowled before.
I don't love it.

15:17.280 --> 15:20.082
Ivy, you cannot just sit home,
driving yourself crazy,

15:20.116 --> 15:21.750
waiting to hear
about <i>Marilyn.</i>

15:21.784 --> 15:22.784
- That's not what I'm doing.
- Yeah, it is.

15:22.835 --> 15:24.569
No, it isn't.

15:24.587 --> 15:27.756
- Here, Ivy, this is for you.
- Well, I agree with Ivy.

15:27.790 --> 15:28.924
You hate bowling too?

15:28.958 --> 15:30.909
No, I agree
with your anger.

15:30.927 --> 15:32.844
I am not angry.

15:32.879 --> 15:34.796
They pay us nothing
for those things,

15:34.847 --> 15:36.298
and as soon as it's over,
no one calls.

15:36.349 --> 15:38.467
And then we end up
prowling around,

15:38.518 --> 15:40.519
trying to figure out
what's going on.

15:40.553 --> 15:42.020
It's ridiculous.

15:42.055 --> 15:44.306
We did all that work
for free, basically,

15:44.357 --> 15:47.258
and we have no right
to even ask a question.

15:47.277 --> 15:48.310
I hate the theater.

15:48.361 --> 15:49.811
I hate the theater.

15:49.846 --> 15:52.965
I love the theater.

15:56.486 --> 15:58.436
Strike!
I got a strike!

15:58.454 --> 16:01.123
Very nice.

16:03.493 --> 16:05.327
- Aww!
- Get up!

16:05.378 --> 16:07.112

Hey! Saint Darrow.
Oh, Ted.

17:39.347 --> 17:41.148
I'm gonna need that speech
you've been working on

17:41.182 --> 17:43.500
for the 9/11 memorial
on Staten Island.

17:43.518 --> 17:45.836
Yeah? Why?

17:45.854 --> 17:48.556
Andrew didn't tell you?

17:48.607 --> 17:50.224
Why don't you tell me?

17:50.275 --> 17:53.944
Okay.
Don't shoot the messenger.

17:53.979 --> 17:57.347
There's some thinking this whole
Oxford thing you got going on

17:57.365 --> 17:59.349
doesn't play
so well out there.

17:59.367 --> 18:02.185
So Andrew asked me
to take it on.

18:02.203 --> 18:04.538
- And when did this happen?
- Last night.

18:04.573 --> 18:06.457
Man, get a few drinks
in that guy,

18:06.491 --> 18:08.042
he just goes on and on.

18:08.076 --> 18:11.879
You can put it on my desk.

18:14.249 --> 18:15.299
Ivy!

18:15.333 --> 18:17.635
Ellis. Hi.

18:17.669 --> 18:18.869
What're you doing here?

18:18.887 --> 18:20.370
I'm taking
the next class.

18:20.388 --> 18:22.056
Ballet?

18:22.090 --> 18:24.308
Yeah...

18:24.342 --> 18:26.727
How's Tom?
Great. How's Derek?

18:26.761 --> 18:29.546
Derek and I are taking
a little bit of a break.

18:29.564 --> 18:31.732
- Really?
- Why?

18:31.766 --> 18:34.551
I gotta be honest, I feel
like he's up to something.

18:34.569 --> 18:36.604
- What do you mean?
- I wish I knew.

18:36.655 --> 18:38.388
Something to do
with Karen, though.

18:38.406 --> 18:41.659
Karen? You've got
to be kidding me.

18:41.693 --> 18:43.077
Wait, so you haven't
talked to Tom,

18:43.111 --> 18:44.578
- you haven't talked to anybody?
- No.

18:46.281 --> 18:48.398
God, if they're gonna
replace me with a star,

18:48.416 --> 18:51.401
that's bad enough,
but Karen Cartwright is nobody.

18:51.419 --> 18:54.121
Well, don't quote me on that.
I don't really know what it is.

18:54.172 --> 18:56.239
I'm gonna go find out.

18:56.257 --> 18:58.408
See ya.

18:58.426 --> 19:01.178
I'm so sorry I'm late.

19:01.212 --> 19:04.765
Not at all. I was early.
I'm being a big pig.

19:04.799 --> 19:06.016
Got you a beer.

19:06.051 --> 19:07.601
It's great seeing you.

19:07.636 --> 19:08.853
I'm glad you had time.

19:08.987 --> 19:11.238
Are you kidding me? I was
so excited to get your call.

19:11.289 --> 19:13.774
- I actually miss the workshop.
- Right?

19:13.808 --> 19:15.331
I can't believe we work
so hard for those things,

19:15.332 --> 19:16.276
and we only get to do it once.

19:16.311 --> 19:17.928
But why do you miss it?

19:17.946 --> 19:20.814
I heard you're still
working on it with Derek.

19:20.865 --> 19:22.866
Who told you that?

19:22.901 --> 19:24.935
Am I not
supposed to know that?

19:24.970 --> 19:26.937
Well, no, they told me,
like, "you can't tell anybody."

19:26.955 --> 19:29.039
Tom and Julia can't know.
No one's supposed to know.

19:29.074 --> 19:30.658
I don't know
what to say to that,

19:30.709 --> 19:31.792
because I actually heard
about it from a couple people.

19:31.826 --> 19:33.443
What did you hear?

19:33.461 --> 19:34.428
Just that
it was happening.

19:34.462 --> 19:36.330
When is it?

19:36.381 --> 19:39.133
Tomorrow, actually.

19:39.167 --> 19:41.852
And what is it, exactly?

19:41.886 --> 19:46.607
Now run this by me again.
You're messing in this why?

19:46.641 --> 19:48.959
Tom asked me to.

19:48.977 --> 19:51.895
He did not ask you
to spy on Ivy.

19:51.930 --> 19:54.464
Look, I'm just trying
to stay on top of things.

19:54.482 --> 19:56.967
There's something going on, and
they want to know what it is.

19:56.985 --> 19:59.469
He finds out you messed
with Ivy, he's gonna fire you.

19:59.487 --> 20:02.906
I don't want to work
for him anyway.

20:02.941 --> 20:05.175
He's an artist.

20:05.210 --> 20:07.578
He's a loser.

20:07.612 --> 20:10.147
Ivy too. You know, she works
her ass off for this workshop,

20:10.165 --> 20:12.483
and then nobody even gave her
a call or the time of day.

20:14.519 --> 20:17.654
Artists
get treated like dirt.

20:17.672 --> 20:19.506
I'm gonna be a producer.

20:19.541 --> 20:21.375
What do producers do?

20:21.426 --> 20:25.512
I am figuring that out.

20:29.300 --> 20:31.435
No, it happens
every time.

20:31.469 --> 20:34.054
Well, he still
has it for you.

20:34.105 --> 20:35.505
He has it in for me.

20:35.523 --> 20:37.674
Surely, you realize
he wants you back.

20:37.692 --> 20:40.010
That's the reason
for all the endless torture?

20:40.028 --> 20:43.113
It's his way of saying,
<i>"je t'aime"?</i>

20:43.148 --> 20:45.032
- Eileen.
- Nick.

20:45.066 --> 20:48.452
- I was hoping you'd be by.
- Thanks.

20:48.486 --> 20:50.237
This is my daughter Katie.

20:50.288 --> 20:53.791
Lovely, like her mother.
How's <i>Marilyn</i> doing?

20:53.825 --> 20:55.692
She's having
some growing pains.

20:55.710 --> 20:59.029
She'll make it through.

20:59.047 --> 21:00.363
Okay.

21:00.381 --> 21:03.300
- This is your new favorite bar?
- Yes.

21:03.334 --> 21:06.386
I can see why.

21:10.091 --> 21:11.925
Got your message.
What's up?

21:11.976 --> 21:13.393
I need
everything you have

21:13.428 --> 21:15.378
on Denby's text
to the mayor's daughter.

21:15.396 --> 21:17.598
Where'd
your conscience go?

21:17.649 --> 21:21.218
Conscience is a luxury
in an economy this lousy.

21:21.236 --> 21:25.222
- I need my job more.
- All right.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.724
I have
a couple of friends

21:27.742 --> 21:30.160
who know more
about how to do this...

21:30.195 --> 21:32.629
Let me get them over here.

21:40.171 --> 21:41.571
Yeah, it's bad.

21:41.589 --> 21:44.007
And the fact that she was 17...
Ouch.

21:44.042 --> 21:45.425
I thought
she was in college.

21:45.460 --> 21:46.844
The older daughter
was in college.

21:46.878 --> 21:48.245
But Denby didn't
send them to her.

21:48.263 --> 21:50.180
He sent them
to the other one.

21:50.215 --> 21:52.599
I think it's time
to break out the cocktails.

21:52.634 --> 21:54.017
This is amazing!

21:54.052 --> 21:56.019
- Cocktails...
- What I'm talking about.

21:56.054 --> 21:57.855
What's this?
A party?

21:57.889 --> 21:59.589
Karen.
We're just... just working.

21:59.607 --> 22:00.974
Yeah, I can see that.

22:01.025 --> 22:02.976
- R.J.
- Hi, Karen.

22:03.027 --> 22:05.629
We'll celebrate later...

22:05.663 --> 22:07.531
Yeah, of course.

22:07.565 --> 22:11.768
- Thanks again so much.
- Yeah.

22:11.786 --> 22:12.953
Have a good night.

22:12.987 --> 22:15.873
- Don't work too late.
- Yeah.

22:15.907 --> 22:18.158
What are you guys
celebrating?

22:18.209 --> 22:20.127
I actually,

22:20.161 --> 22:22.379
Actually,
I can't tell you.

22:22.413 --> 22:27.417
Why? No one else keeps secrets
in this town, why should you?

22:36.928 --> 22:39.346
I am so
not interested in R.J.

22:39.397 --> 22:41.899
Well, then why can't I know
what she was doing here?

22:41.933 --> 22:44.685
We were looking
at racy photos on the Internet.

22:44.736 --> 22:47.688
Some politician's been caught
with his pants down.

22:49.007 --> 22:53.994
Your lot's as bad
as my lot.

22:55.663 --> 22:59.149
Why? What's your lot
been up to?

22:59.167 --> 23:01.151
I still haven't
figured it out.

23:01.169 --> 23:04.371
I spent the whole day singing
touch me to a bunch of dancers.

23:04.422 --> 23:05.923
Yeah?

23:05.957 --> 23:07.758
Anybody take you up on it?

23:07.792 --> 23:09.760
No.

23:09.794 --> 23:12.495
Not yet.

23:12.513 --> 23:15.849
Wait, what was it
you were singing again?

23:15.884 --> 23:18.869
<i>Touch me.</i>

23:18.903 --> 23:23.857
I wanna feel it on my body.

23:23.892 --> 23:26.396
Put your hands on me.

23:51.966 --> 23:54.184
- You sang great.
- Thank you.

23:54.218 --> 23:58.188
- You look great too.
- Aww, thank you.

23:58.222 --> 23:59.355
Just one note.

23:59.390 --> 24:02.325
Don't be afraid of the sex.

24:02.359 --> 24:06.196
- I'm not afraid...
- You are.

24:07.630 --> 24:09.501
And it's beautiful.

24:11.235 --> 24:13.753
It's what Marilyn had.

24:13.788 --> 24:16.372
Purity.

24:16.407 --> 24:20.910
And on top of that purity
was sex.

24:22.746 --> 24:26.299
Just think about it, okay?

24:31.255 --> 24:32.972
- I heard you were in town.
- Hi, Tom.

24:33.007 --> 24:36.042
I'm so sorry I missed
the <i>Marilyn</i> workshop.

24:36.060 --> 24:37.644
You have
a whole world to save.

24:37.678 --> 24:39.813
With us, it's just
the American theater.

24:39.847 --> 24:41.564
No small feat...

24:41.599 --> 24:42.932
Julia!

24:42.983 --> 24:45.718
You look gorgeous as usual.
Me? You!

24:45.736 --> 24:47.604
So what're we all doing

24:47.655 --> 24:49.722
out in the middle
of Brooklyn anyway?

24:49.740 --> 24:52.609
Let's find out.

24:59.867 --> 25:04.838
- There's a stage door there.
- Okay.

25:04.872 --> 25:07.240
Seven, eight...

25:07.258 --> 25:09.843
Okay.

25:09.877 --> 25:11.410
Hi, Mrs. Rand.

25:11.428 --> 25:12.912
It's great,
you're gonna love it.

25:12.930 --> 25:14.931
- Excellent.
- Karen, you're in on this too?

25:14.965 --> 25:17.750
- Yeah, I guess.
- Wha... what's going on?

25:17.768 --> 25:18.768
I was gonna show you,
darling.

25:18.802 --> 25:21.971
Tom.

25:22.022 --> 25:23.773
Now, this is a little bit
unusual, guys,

25:23.807 --> 25:25.358
so just bear with us.

25:25.392 --> 25:30.396
Karen, you set?
Yup. Ready!

25:32.283 --> 25:33.766
Okay.

25:33.784 --> 25:37.954
Ryan, let 'er rip!

All right.

29:14.288 --> 29:18.674
So what you've just seen is a
potential direction for <i>Marilyn.</i>

29:18.709 --> 29:21.494
Now, we all know
there's a historical Marilyn,

29:21.512 --> 29:22.929
but there's also
a contemporary Marilyn.

29:22.963 --> 29:24.180
A Marilyn
for a new generation.

29:24.214 --> 29:25.998
Wait, hang on.

29:26.016 --> 29:27.834
Look, we're not talking
about an entirely new take,

29:27.868 --> 29:29.385
just breaking open
what we have.

29:29.436 --> 29:32.438
We were afraid
that, you'd be resistant

29:32.473 --> 29:33.890
to the idea
in the abstract, so...

29:35.642 --> 29:38.111
We thought we'd
show something to you.

29:38.145 --> 29:40.930
So you did this
as a favor to us.

29:40.964 --> 29:44.183
While you were busy
not answering our phone calls

29:44.201 --> 29:45.618
and our emails, and after

29:45.652 --> 29:48.454
we worked our hearts out
on this workshop?

29:48.489 --> 29:50.873
I'm sorry.

29:50.908 --> 29:53.025
Is something wrong?

29:53.043 --> 29:54.693
I'm so, so sorry.

29:54.711 --> 29:57.046
Mom, can I talk to you
outside, please?

29:57.080 --> 30:01.050
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

30:07.307 --> 30:09.542
I can't believe
you would do that.

30:09.560 --> 30:13.396
To people you know, who you've
worked with, who trust you.

30:13.430 --> 30:15.214
You don't understand
show business.

30:15.232 --> 30:16.983
I grew up
in show business!

30:17.017 --> 30:18.401
And it's this kind of crap

30:18.435 --> 30:20.102
that made me want
to flee to Micronesia.

30:20.154 --> 30:21.720
What are you thinking?

30:21.738 --> 30:23.906
I'm thinking I have
half a terrific show,

30:23.941 --> 30:25.274
and it needs help.

30:25.325 --> 30:26.130
You know what, mom?

30:26.131 --> 30:28.161
This is exactly the kind
of garbage dad would pull.

30:28.195 --> 30:30.112
Your father's
a very good businessman.

30:30.164 --> 30:31.230
He's a jerk!

30:31.248 --> 30:34.000
He's a colossal...

30:34.034 --> 30:36.752
But I love him,
and he's my father.

30:36.787 --> 30:40.256
You would never
do something like that.

30:40.290 --> 30:42.074
You know, people always say

30:42.092 --> 30:45.094
I'm such a good person,
and they're all "Mahatma Katie,"

30:45.128 --> 30:46.846
but I do, I try.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.848
I don't want to put
toxic garbage into the world,

30:48.882 --> 30:51.851
I want to put something good
into the world.

30:51.885 --> 30:52.918
So do I.

30:52.936 --> 30:55.087
I know you do.

30:55.105 --> 30:57.356
How do you think
I got like this?

30:57.391 --> 31:01.260
You can't just
turn into dad, mom.

31:01.278 --> 31:04.947
Really, you can't.

31:06.950 --> 31:10.786
Proposing a new direction
for material that is not working

31:10.821 --> 31:12.205
is not beyond the realms
of acceptable behavior!

31:12.239 --> 31:13.206
I am the director!

31:13.240 --> 31:14.773
I am so uninterested

31:14.791 --> 31:15.958
in what you think of
as "acceptable behavior."

31:15.993 --> 31:18.996
Enough! Enough!
Enough! Enough!

31:20.047 --> 31:22.131
Listen, I want to thank you
for all your work.

31:22.165 --> 31:24.467
But I'm afraid we've made
a terrible mistake.

31:24.501 --> 31:27.136
Come on!
They were terrific!

31:27.170 --> 31:29.005
Julia,

31:29.056 --> 31:31.724
I apologize.

31:31.758 --> 31:35.628
Tom, I apologize
to you too.

31:35.646 --> 31:37.963
Derek, I apologize to you too...

31:37.981 --> 31:39.315
This wasn't
meant to happen.

31:39.349 --> 31:41.183
I think that
what Eileen means to say

31:41.218 --> 31:43.135
is we'll put a meeting on the
books for tomorrow morning,

31:43.153 --> 31:45.388
discuss the next step?

31:45.422 --> 31:46.405
How did he get here?

31:46.440 --> 31:47.690
Does that really matter?

31:47.724 --> 31:49.242
I think that
what's important

31:49.276 --> 31:50.910
is that we dial
this down for now,

31:50.944 --> 31:52.695
and give everyone a chance
to gather their thoughts.

31:52.746 --> 31:55.615
Let me call you a car.

31:58.952 --> 32:01.337
Look, guys, I'm so sorry.

32:01.371 --> 32:03.822
I honestly had no idea they didn't
tell you what was going on.

32:03.840 --> 32:06.509
It's okay.

32:10.047 --> 32:11.013
Get in.

32:17.387 --> 32:20.022
- Didn't go so well?
- Ivy.

32:20.057 --> 32:22.224
You know, this wasn't what
I thought it was going to be.

32:22.276 --> 32:25.061
Apparently wasn't what anyone
thought it was going to be.

32:25.112 --> 32:28.614
It's okay.
It's a dirty business.

32:28.649 --> 32:32.118
I totally understand why you'd stab
Tom and Julia in the back like that.

32:32.152 --> 32:34.704
- I didn't stab Tom...
- Didn't you?

32:34.738 --> 32:36.956
It's okay, Karen.

32:36.990 --> 32:40.376
I understand.

32:46.083 --> 32:48.634
You comin'?

32:48.669 --> 32:52.338
Nope.

33:01.765 --> 33:03.299
What?

33:03.333 --> 33:06.218
I should never have
let you near this project.

33:06.236 --> 33:08.537
But you did.

33:08.572 --> 33:10.272
'Cause you haven't
got the edge,

33:10.307 --> 33:12.825
or the insight,
or the balls

33:12.859 --> 33:14.276
to make <i>Marilyn</i>
<i>what she needs to be.</i>

33:14.328 --> 33:17.496
- That is completely...
- Completely what, Tom?

33:17.531 --> 33:19.448
Do tell.
What, the truth?

33:19.499 --> 33:21.117
There was no other
reason to hire me,

33:21.168 --> 33:24.587
and everyone is well aware
of how angry you are at me

33:24.621 --> 33:28.407
for whatever nonsense
you think I pulled 11 years ago.

33:28.425 --> 33:30.142
You mean when you
tried to destroy my career?

33:30.177 --> 33:31.844
- You mean that "nonsense"?
- We did a show together, Tom.

33:31.878 --> 33:33.496
It went badly. It happens.

33:33.530 --> 33:34.913
You botched
that production.

33:34.931 --> 33:36.582
Not according
<i>the New York Times.</i>

33:36.600 --> 33:38.684
That critic
was in your pocket!

33:38.719 --> 33:40.770
No. He liked my direction.
He didn't like your songs.

33:40.804 --> 33:41.771
It happens.

33:41.805 --> 33:43.139
You bragged about it.

33:43.190 --> 33:45.524
That's what you get
when they've known you since birth!

33:45.525 --> 33:47.443
- Listen!
- I don't care about the critics.

33:47.477 --> 33:50.112
- We all care about the critics.
- What I care about still

33:50.147 --> 33:52.448
is the fact that you went
to every theater in town,

33:52.482 --> 33:53.466
and trashed me.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.100
You were vicious.

33:55.118 --> 33:58.954
You told every producer I know
that I was unstable,

33:58.989 --> 34:00.940
that my talent
had always been overrated,

34:00.974 --> 34:02.375
that I would never
be an artist.

34:02.409 --> 34:03.959
Well, that is
an interesting fiction.

34:03.994 --> 34:05.188
That last one you said to my face,

34:05.189 --> 34:06.779
screaming at me in the
middle of Bar Centrale.

34:06.797 --> 34:08.164
No, don't remember
any of that.

34:08.215 --> 34:11.132
We were friends!
Do you remember that?

34:11.168 --> 34:13.552
Do you know what?

34:13.587 --> 34:16.005
Gay men never cease
to amaze me.

34:16.056 --> 34:18.474
You own the New York
theater scene,

34:18.507 --> 34:19.891
but yet you constantly
prance around,

34:19.926 --> 34:23.145
whining about
what victims you are.

34:23.179 --> 34:25.014
The logic of the bully.

34:25.065 --> 34:26.815
You're allowed to hit me,
but it's my fault if I breathe.

34:26.850 --> 34:28.050
How have I hit you?

34:28.085 --> 34:29.235
What was this?

34:29.268 --> 34:31.786
Don't bother
answering that.

34:31.822 --> 34:34.489
And for your information,
homophobe,

34:34.524 --> 34:36.158
that critic wasn't
in your pocket,

34:36.193 --> 34:38.476
he was having sex
with your father.

34:38.495 --> 34:41.414
Everyone knew about it.

34:41.447 --> 34:42.998
Never heard you
bragging about that.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.991
Yeah.

34:53.009 --> 34:54.927
Good for you, Tom.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.263
Welcome to my level.

34:57.297 --> 34:59.765
Now, if you want to talk
about <i>Marilyn,</i>

34:59.800 --> 35:02.334
let me tell you
a couple of things.

35:02.352 --> 35:06.055
Now, your songs are beautiful.
They're fun.

35:06.106 --> 35:08.107
They're too nice.

35:08.141 --> 35:11.009
Yeah, Marilyn
was gorgeous and wounded,

35:11.027 --> 35:12.061
but she was also
a drug-addicted,

35:12.112 --> 35:13.612
suicidal sexual icon,

35:13.647 --> 35:16.449
the like of which the world
cannot get enough.

35:16.483 --> 35:19.034
She is an insanely provocative
and timeless figure.

35:19.069 --> 35:20.686
She is not...

35:20.704 --> 35:22.738
Some sweet,
little gay male fantasy.

35:22.789 --> 35:24.206
You don't get to say
what she was.

35:24.241 --> 35:26.859
Neither do you!

35:27.895 --> 35:29.899
I'm not quitting.

35:34.529 --> 35:36.144
Neither am I.

35:42.112 --> 35:43.412
All right.

35:43.506 --> 35:45.907
Yesterday's experiment
provided us

35:45.925 --> 35:47.959
with some interesting
information.

35:48.010 --> 35:49.794
We don't need
different composers,

35:49.845 --> 35:52.097
since the ones we have
are brilliant.

35:52.131 --> 35:55.133
However, if this project
is going to move forward,

35:55.167 --> 35:56.601
we do need a star.

35:58.637 --> 36:00.922
- Ivy...
- Is terrific.

36:00.956 --> 36:03.174
But we have to
be realistic.

36:03.209 --> 36:06.094
So I'm gonna talk to Bernie and
ask him to put together a list

36:06.128 --> 36:09.114
of people who are available
and interested for Marilyn.

36:09.148 --> 36:10.448
That's all.

36:14.120 --> 36:15.754
Tom.

36:15.788 --> 36:17.422
Julia.

36:17.456 --> 36:21.659
We're also gonna
need a title.

36:25.131 --> 36:26.965
Ellis.
What're you doing here?

36:26.999 --> 36:28.716
Do you work
for Eileen now?

36:28.751 --> 36:30.618
Actually, I do.

36:30.636 --> 36:31.803
Thanks for
the opportunity.

36:31.837 --> 36:36.841
I really enjoyed
working with you.

36:38.310 --> 36:39.627
Tom.

36:39.645 --> 36:42.964
Eileen Rand's office.

36:42.982 --> 36:45.183
Who may I ask is calling?

36:45.234 --> 36:49.637
I'd say, "good riddance,"
but we're still stuck with him.

36:49.655 --> 36:53.074
One moment, please.

36:53.109 --> 36:55.076
Well, I'm stuck at this
cultural affairs thing

36:55.111 --> 36:56.978
- in midtown till about 3:00...
- Andrew.

36:56.996 --> 36:59.697
Get a chance to look at the press
release for this afternoon?

36:59.748 --> 37:01.332
Yeah, it's terrific.
Just send it out.

37:01.367 --> 37:03.168
- All right. See you upstairs?
- Yeah. Be right there.

37:03.202 --> 37:04.586
What is he
still doing here?

37:04.620 --> 37:05.837
That stuff I sent you
is horrific.

37:05.871 --> 37:06.921
You gotta leave it alone.

37:06.956 --> 37:08.322
- W-why?
- I don't know.

37:08.340 --> 37:09.991
What do you mean
you don't know?

37:10.009 --> 37:12.043
Look...

37:12.094 --> 37:14.328
I took that stuff over
to the chief of staff's office.

37:14.346 --> 37:15.580
It disappeared.

37:15.614 --> 37:18.099
I don't know
what his story is,

37:18.134 --> 37:22.353
but he's untouchable.

37:40.623 --> 37:45.193
I know you're going through,
like, huge changes, mom, but...

37:45.211 --> 37:47.629
You can't sleep
on the floor.

37:47.663 --> 37:50.217
Beautiful.

37:52.251 --> 37:54.919
It's how I see you.

38:01.510 --> 38:03.645
You're leaving, aren't you?

38:03.679 --> 38:05.763
Well, these people I know
are going to Alaska

38:05.814 --> 38:08.233
to count wild salmon.

38:08.267 --> 38:10.718
So they asked me
to give them a hand.

38:10.736 --> 38:12.570
Why are you doing that?

38:12.605 --> 38:15.240
You know, mom,
I don't ask you

38:15.274 --> 38:18.245
why you produce plays
on Broadway.

38:20.279 --> 38:23.731
Tom!

38:23.749 --> 38:25.583
Hi.

38:25.618 --> 38:28.253
- Thanks for meeting me here.
- I'm so glad you called.

38:28.287 --> 38:30.121
I know, I should've
called sooner.

38:30.172 --> 38:31.623
No, no, no.

38:31.674 --> 38:33.091
I know there's
all kinds of stuff

38:33.125 --> 38:34.909
to be sorted out
after these workshops.

38:34.927 --> 38:36.561
You've been swamped,
I'm sure.

38:36.595 --> 38:38.413
You were so great,

38:38.447 --> 38:40.298
and I know it's just completely
nerve-racking not to hear.

38:40.349 --> 38:43.417
Well, I know
you were working.

38:43.435 --> 38:45.353
So tell me
what's going on.

38:45.387 --> 38:48.606
Well...

38:48.641 --> 38:51.425
I hope you didn't
read the blogs.

38:51.443 --> 38:53.027
Why? Did they say
something mean about me?

38:53.062 --> 38:55.113
They just
complain in general.

38:55.147 --> 38:57.265
And so we're working
and writing,

38:57.283 --> 39:01.536
and Derek has
some crazy ideas, and...

39:01.570 --> 39:04.438
Eileen wants to go
with a star.

39:04.456 --> 39:08.376
For Marilyn.

39:08.410 --> 39:10.128
She does.

39:10.162 --> 39:13.164
I mean, who knows when,
or if, we'll keep going,

39:13.215 --> 39:14.615
or what will happen
if we do,

39:14.633 --> 39:17.051
but right now
they're thinking...

39:17.086 --> 39:21.556
To get this to Broadway,
we need a star.

39:21.590 --> 39:23.641
They do.

39:23.676 --> 39:26.794
Of course they do.

39:26.812 --> 39:31.299
You were wonderful.
You are wonderful.

39:36.021 --> 39:41.025
But I'm not a star.

39:43.912 --> 39:47.699
You know you can come
back <i>heaven on earth.</i>

39:47.750 --> 39:52.754
Whenever you're ready.

40:18.564 --> 40:20.514
How was your day?

40:20.532 --> 40:23.284
You know. Politics.

40:23.319 --> 40:24.902
Tell me about it.

40:24.953 --> 40:26.904
No, no. Actually,
don't tell me about it.

40:26.955 --> 40:29.457
I'm terrible at it,
and I can't do it, and...

40:29.491 --> 40:31.459
Here.

40:31.493 --> 40:33.011
Taste this.

40:33.045 --> 40:37.965
Come on.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.533
Well, that is really...

40:39.551 --> 40:41.869
- That is really, really good.
- See?

40:41.887 --> 40:43.755
Cooking and singing,
that I can do.

40:57.019 --> 41:00.405
♪ Fade in on a girl

41:00.439 --> 41:04.559
♪ with a hunger for fame

41:04.593 --> 41:07.795
♪ and a face and a name

41:07.830 --> 41:10.398
♪ to remember

41:12.918 --> 41:14.168
Go away.

41:16.038 --> 41:17.905
I'm not kidding.
Go away.

41:25.664 --> 41:27.415
Are you all right?

41:27.433 --> 41:30.635
What do you think?

41:30.686 --> 41:33.471
I think
show business sucks.

41:33.522 --> 41:36.824
I think you
are truly gifted.

41:36.859 --> 41:39.610
And I think
you're beautiful.

41:39.645 --> 41:42.480
It's okay, Derek.

41:42.531 --> 41:43.948
You don't have to
take care of the loser.

41:43.982 --> 41:46.150
That's not
what I'm doing.

41:46.201 --> 41:49.036
They want me
back in the chorus.

41:49.071 --> 41:51.422
You don't have to
think about that tonight.

41:51.457 --> 41:53.274
I was good.

41:53.292 --> 41:58.279
Ivy, Ivy...

41:58.297 --> 42:03.217
You were better than good.

42:03.252 --> 42:05.786
You asked Karen
to do her.

42:05.804 --> 42:10.675
It was a failed experiment
in every way.

42:10.726 --> 42:13.461
You've been hideous.

42:13.495 --> 42:17.181
You told me
I was lousy in bed.

42:17.232 --> 42:19.236
In front of everyone.

42:27.025 --> 42:29.060
I lied.

42:31.530 --> 42:34.198
Good.
