Okay, I've changed my mind
about all of this,

53:32.800 --> 53:36.167
so can you stop, and I'll --
I'll get out and walk?

53:36.200 --> 53:37.800
It's not far now.

53:37.833 --> 53:39.533
**

53:39.567 --> 53:41.733
What?

53:41.767 --> 53:43.367
What?

53:43.400 --> 53:44.367
What's not far?

53:44.400 --> 53:45.533
No.
I want to go home.

53:45.567 --> 53:47.133
Can you just stop, please?

53:47.167 --> 53:48.667
I'll just get out.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.533
Please.

54:09.800 --> 54:12.100
What's going on?

54:12.133 --> 54:15.400
Some sort of
white slave trafficking?

54:15.433 --> 54:16.567
Please tell me
some good news.

54:16.600 --> 54:19.200
Please.

54:19.233 --> 54:22.300
The good news is I have lied
to you as little as possible.

It's me. It's me.
Hey.
