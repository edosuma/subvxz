WEBVTT

00:23.023 --> 00:23.857
THE BLOCK...

00:23.891 --> 00:28.596
>> I NOMINATED ELENA AND JASON
AS PONDS.

00:28.629 --> 00:31.232
>> Announcer: A BACKDOOR PLAN
WAS UNDER WAY TO GET CODY OUT.

00:31.265 --> 00:34.735
>> EVEN THOUGH I DON'T FEEL
TOTALLY SAFE, THE PLAN IS TO

00:34.768 --> 00:37.271
BACKDOOR CODY, AND HE'S A HUGE
TARGET.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.740
>> Announcer: AT THE VETO
COMPETITION, PRIZES AND

00:39.773 --> 00:41.809
PUNISHMENTS WERE ON THE LINE.

00:41.842 --> 00:46.080
>> EXTREME I-TARD.

00:46.114 --> 00:48.982
>> Announcer: WHEN IT CAME
DOWN TO ALEX AND ELENA, THEY

00:49.016 --> 00:51.119
MADE A DEAL.

00:51.152 --> 00:56.457
>> Announcer: BUT AFTER ALEX
GOT $5,000, ELENA WENT BACK ON

00:56.490 --> 00:58.459
HER WORD, GIVING HER A
PUNISHMENT.

00:58.492 --> 01:01.462
>> I REALLY WANT THE $5,000.

01:01.495 --> 01:04.232
>> Announcer: AND MATT ENDED
UP WITH THE POWER OF VETO.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.666
>> CONGRATULATIONS, MATT!

01:05.699 --> 01:08.169
YOU WON THE VETO.

01:08.202 --> 01:15.243
>> Announcer: ALEC WAS FURIOUS
AND WANTED ELENA GONE.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.545
LEAVING CODY WITH A RAY OF HOPE.

01:17.578 --> 01:21.282
>> IS TAKING FIVE GRAND GOING TO
MAKE ME EVEN MORE OF A TARGET

01:21.315 --> 01:22.316
THAN I ALREADY AM?

01:22.350 --> 01:23.784
>> YES.

01:23.817 --> 01:27.455
ELENA'S MESS-UP MIGHT BE MY
SAVING GRACE IN THE GAME.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.457
>> Announcer: THAT NIGHT,
>> I'M SO EXTREME!

01:29.490 --> 01:33.127
>> Announcer: WHILE CHRISTMAS
AND PAUL WERE FORCED TO GO SKY

01:33.161 --> 01:33.561
DIVING.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.495
>> SHORT STEPS.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.397
>> Announcer: AND ALEX BECAME
A CAMP GUIDE.

01:36.430 --> 01:41.669
>> EVERY TIME I HEAR THE BUGLE,
I HAVE SET UP A WHOLE ENTIRE

01:41.702 --> 01:44.338
CAMPSITE, COOK 11 HOT DOGS.

01:44.372 --> 01:47.641
IT MAKES MEANTIME TO TAKE EVERY
ONE OF THOSE 11 HOT DOGS AND

01:47.675 --> 01:49.076
SLAP ELENA AROUND WITH IT.

01:49.109 --> 01:52.012
>> Announcer: BEFORE THE VETO
MEETING, CODY MADE A FINAL PITCH

01:52.045 --> 01:53.214
FOR HIS LIFE.

01:53.247 --> 01:56.350
>> I WANT TO YOU THINK BACK TO
WHEN YOU WERE IN THIS POSITION

01:56.384 --> 01:59.287
AND I YOU ASKED ME TO SAVE YOU
AND I I DID.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.589
>> I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT
IT.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.224
>> Announcer: BUT AFTER MATT
SAVED JASON...

02:03.257 --> 02:05.393
>> I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE
POWER OF VETO ON YOU.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.661
>> EXTREME!

02:07.695 --> 02:10.731
>> Announcer: ALEX FULFILLED
THE HOUSE'S ORIGINAL PLAN.

02:10.764 --> 02:14.702
>> I'M SORRY, CODY, I NOMINATE
YOU.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.370
I WASH MY HANDS OF THIS.

02:16.404 --> 02:19.740
>> Announcer: TONIGHT, CODY,
MATT, OR ELENA WILL GO HOME BUT

02:19.773 --> 02:22.843
THEY WON'T BE ALONE BECAUSE IT'S
DOUBLE-EVICTION NIGHT, BABY.

02:22.876 --> 02:26.747
THAT'S RIGHT, A FULL WEEK OF
ACTION ALL IN ONE CRAZY HOUR!

02:26.780 --> 02:30.284
ALL THIS LIVE ON "BIG BROTHER"!

02:30.318 --> 02:35.122
>> THE TAN-DAM SKY DIVE.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.391
>> WHAT'S A TAN

02:37.425 --> 02:41.061
>> JOSH, TANDEM, TANDEM.

03:23.203 --> 03:23.771
>> Julie: GOOD EVENING.

03:23.804 --> 03:24.772
I'M JULIE CHEN.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.840
WELCOME TO DOUBLE-EVICTION
NIGHT.

03:26.874 --> 03:32.313
FOR WEEKS NOW, THE MAJORITY OF
THE HOUSE HAVE HAD A

03:32.346 --> 03:33.514
COMMON ENEMY IN CODY.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.716
TONIGHT, IF HE WALKS OUT THE
DOOR, THEY'LL BE FORCED TO TURN

03:35.749 --> 03:39.287
ON EACH OTHER, AND THAT WILL
HAPPEN FASTER THAN THEY CAN EVEN

03:39.320 --> 03:42.556
IMAGINE, BECAUSE WE ARE ABOUT TO
KICK THINGS INTO OVERDRIVE AND

03:42.590 --> 03:50.931
THROW A WEEK'S WORTH OF "BIG
BROTHER" AT THEM IN JUST ONE

03:50.964 --> 03:52.032
NIGHT.

03:52.065 --> 03:52.966
AND BY THE TIME THE DUST
SETTLES, TWO HOUSEGUESTS WILL

03:53.000 --> 03:53.934
HEAD TO THE JURY HOUSE.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.403
SO, WHICH TWO HOUSEGUESTS WILL
BE SENT PACKING?

03:55.436 --> 03:58.972
WE'LL FIND OUT, LIVE, TONIGHT.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.475
BUT FIRST, WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR
OWN AND YOUR BACK'S AGAINST THE

04:01.509 --> 04:03.677
WALL, SOMETIMES THE BEST PLAY IS
TO SIT BACK AND LET THE HOUSE

04:03.711 --> 04:06.847
IMPLODE.

04:06.880 --> 04:15.623
>> THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

04:15.656 --> 04:19.393
>> MATT NOT USING THE VETO TO
SAVE HIMSELF, I'M NOT SHOCKED.

04:19.427 --> 04:22.095
THE GUY'S' WUSS.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.532
I FIGURED EVERYONE WAS GOING TO
BACKDOOR ME.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.334
I'M NO LONGER THE BIG TARGET.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.601
I'M JUST THE SAFE ONE.

04:27.635 --> 04:32.406
I'M TRYING TO FIND ANY PATHWAY
TO STAYING SAFE THIS WEEK.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.974
I'M NOT SURE IT'S THERE, THOUGH.

04:34.007 --> 04:37.611
>> JASON, VERY WELL COMPUTED,
SIR.

04:37.645 --> 04:38.211
>> THANK YOU.

04:38.245 --> 04:40.681
I WANTED TO SAY "HONORED."

04:40.714 --> 04:45.619
HOW DO I FEEL ABOUT BEING TAKEN
OFF THE BLOCK?

04:45.653 --> 04:49.222
I FEEL EXTREMELY EXCITED!

04:49.256 --> 04:51.091
YEAH!

04:51.124 --> 04:51.725
OH, YOU GOT IT ON.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.494
>> I CAN GET IT ON.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.828
IT'S JUST REALLY EXTREMELY HARD.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.229
>> IT'S EXTREMELY HARD!

04:56.263 --> 04:57.431
>> EXTREMELY HARD.

04:57.465 --> 05:04.672
>> I'M STILL PISSED AT ELENA FOR
TAKING MY 5KSPS IN THE VETO

05:04.705 --> 05:05.873
COMPETITION.

05:05.906 --> 05:09.477
EVEN THOUGH ELENA WOULD BE MY
TARGET, THE HOUSE WANTS CODY.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.211
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO?

05:11.244 --> 05:14.114
I'M GOING TO MAKE A GRILLED
CHEESE.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.248
WHO WANTS ONE?

05:15.282 --> 05:18.752
>> I'M NOT GOING TO LIE, BEING
ON THE BLOCK STILL SUCKS.

05:18.786 --> 05:22.189
MY PLAN IS JUST TO CONTINUE TO
NOT BE CRAZY.

05:22.222 --> 05:25.092
* SHE HAS THE BLUEST EYES IN THE
WORLD *

05:25.125 --> 05:35.168
>> I HAVE GREEP EYES
* YES, SHE HAS GREE GREEN EYES

05:35.168 --> 05:44.778
>> I HAVE GREEP EYES
* YES, SHE HAS GREE GREEN EYES

05:44.812 --> 05:50.551
YOU KNOW WHAT, I KNOW THEY'RE
SHADY.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.652
EVERYBODY'S GUNNING FOR CODY.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.753
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:52.786 --> 05:55.923
I'M TIRED OF SEEING ELENA AND
MARK PLAYING BOTH SIDES.

05:55.956 --> 05:59.527
THEY'RE BOTH A PACK OF MEATBALLS
AND I'M DONE WITH THE

05:59.560 --> 05:59.960
FLIP-FLOPPING.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.094
>> SORRY, JOSH.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.196
>> I'VE BEEN WANTING TO DRAWT
LINE WITH ELENA AND MARK.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.466
IT'S TIME TO PUT THE TARGET ON
THEM NEXT WEEK.

06:05.499 --> 06:08.268
CODY, ONE QUESTION, WHEN YOU
CAME IN THE SECOND TIME, NOT THE

06:08.301 --> 06:11.472
FIRST TIME-- I KNEW YOU HAD AN
ALLIANCE THE FIRST TIME.

06:11.505 --> 06:12.706
DID MARK ALIGN WITH YOU AGAIN?

06:12.740 --> 06:15.375
>> NO, IT WAS JUST ME AND
JESSICA.

06:15.409 --> 06:18.011
>> IT WAS JUST A FRIENDSHIP YOU
GUYS HAD.

06:18.045 --> 06:18.879
>> YEAH, THAT'S IT.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.313
>> CLARITY.

06:20.347 --> 06:20.948
THERE'S CLARITY.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.182
THAT'S ALL THAT WE NEEDED.

06:22.215 --> 06:26.487
>> I DID NOT KNOW WHERE YOU TWO
STOOD UNTIL JESS GOT POWER AND

06:26.520 --> 06:29.256
YOU RALLIED UP WITH THEM, AND
YOU WENT ON A POWER TRIP AND

06:29.289 --> 06:31.559
VOTED ME OUT.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.327
>> I DIDN'T CAMPAIGN ONCE
AGAINST YOU.

06:34.361 --> 06:35.596
>> ELENA.

06:35.629 --> 06:39.366
AS SOON AS I SAW YOU GOING UP AS
A PAWN, PAUL'S PLAYING A BETTER

06:39.399 --> 06:40.000
GAME.

06:40.033 --> 06:40.534
HE'S PLAYED THE GAME BEFORE.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.436
HE CAN WIN MORE COMPS.

06:42.470 --> 06:45.205
ALEX HAS ONE MORE VETO, AND
SHE'S A BETTER GIRL COMPETITOR.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.108
>> I LITERALLY DID NOT SAY-- YOU
ARE TWISTING MY WORDS.

06:48.141 --> 06:51.144
NO, I DID NOT SAY THOSE WORDS IN
THE CONTEXT THAT YOU ARE MAKING

06:51.178 --> 06:52.446
IT SOUND LIKE I SAID THEM.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.515
>> OKAY, SO HOW DID YOU SAY
THEM?

06:54.548 --> 06:57.017
I LITERALLY JUST ASKED YOU AND
THEN YOU STARTED DROPPING NAMES.

06:57.050 --> 07:00.821
>> THE ONLY REASON I GOT--
>> IF YOU'RE GOING TO SCREAM.

07:00.854 --> 07:05.859
>> I'M SCREAMING BECAUSE YOU ARE
SPEAKING OVER ME SO IF YOU SHUT

07:05.893 --> 07:08.629
THE  UP FOR FIVE SECONDS
I CAN FINISH MY SENTENCE.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.598
>> YOU'RE A BLATANT LIAR.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.099
>> SHUT UP.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.634
>> I AM NOT DONE!

07:13.667 --> 07:15.536
>> WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING?

07:15.569 --> 07:16.369
I WANT TO DRAWT LINE.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.237
>> CAN I FINISH!

07:17.270 --> 07:18.606
I HAVE NOT LIED ONCE.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.741
>> I DON'T TRUST YOU AT ALL.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.811
NOT ONLY BECAUSE YOU VOTED ME
OUT, BUT BECAUSE YOUR ACTIONS IN

07:23.844 --> 07:27.447
THIS GAME, AND YOUR $5,000 CHECK
PROVED IT.

07:27.481 --> 07:28.381
BUT, ANYWAY, GO AHEAD.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.283
>> GO AHEAD.

07:30.317 --> 07:30.784
EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED.

07:30.818 --> 07:31.552
>> WITH WHAT, THIS?

07:31.585 --> 07:33.521
>> THE VETO COMPETITION.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.223
>> THE WAY I UNDERSTAND AN
ELIMINATION VETO COMPETITION--

07:36.256 --> 07:38.191
>> WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?

07:38.225 --> 07:40.761
"DON'T WORRY, WE PROMISE NOT TO
CURSE EACH OTHER."

07:40.794 --> 07:41.294
DID YOU NOT?

07:41.328 --> 07:44.031
IT'S A YES OR NO.

07:44.064 --> 07:44.698
DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.

07:44.732 --> 07:45.766
YES OR NO.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.735
>> WE DID PROMISE NOT TO CURSE
EACH OTHER, HOWEVER--

07:47.768 --> 07:49.269
>> NO, NO, NO.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.871
THAT'S YOUR WORD RIGHT HERE.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.305
EVERYONE HERE SEES IT.

07:52.339 --> 07:52.840
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.942
WE'RE A TEAM.

07:54.975 --> 07:55.776
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TRUST YOU.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.311
>> ARE THEY STILL GOING AT IT IN
THERE?

07:58.345 --> 07:59.913
THESE PEOPLE ARE LUNATICS, MAN.

07:59.947 --> 08:02.750
AT THIS POINT, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH ME.

08:02.783 --> 08:03.651
THEY MIGHT KEEP ME.

08:03.684 --> 08:04.351
THEY MIGHT DO THAT.

08:04.384 --> 08:05.485
WHO KNOWS?

08:05.519 --> 08:06.153
THEY'RE CRAZY.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.521
>> YOU WENT AGAINST YOUR WORD.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.322
YOU WENT AGAINST THIS TEAM.

08:09.356 --> 08:12.459
>> THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN
DEALING WITH THE LAST COUPLE OF

08:12.492 --> 08:13.226
WEEKS.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.729
IT'S ME AND ELENA VERSUS THE
HOUSE.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.965
ALL I'M THINKING ABOUT IS THIS
H.O.H.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.432
I'M COMING OUT SWINGING
THURSDAY.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.869
>> HAVE NO RESPECT FOR ANYONE
ANYONE.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.104
>> TALKING TO YOU GIVES ME
HEARTBURN.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.573
>> COULDN'T BE HAPPIER RIGHT
NOW.

08:25.606 --> 08:28.441
FINALLY, THE HOUSE IS SEEING
ELENA SHOW HER FUTURE COLORS.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.644
I WANTED TO MAKE HER A FUTURE
TARGET.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.146
BUT SHE'S SITTING ON THE BLOCK
THIS WEEKEND.

08:33.180 --> 08:38.018
SHE'S LOOKING LIKE A REAL GOOD
ONE RIGHT NOW!

08:38.051 --> 08:39.687
>> Julie: WE HAVE A LOT TO DO
AND NO TIME TO WASTE.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.055
LET'S HEAD TO THE LIVING ROOM
AND LET THE HOUSEGUESTS IN ON

08:42.089 --> 08:42.590
TONIGHT'S DOUBLE EVICTION.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.491
HELLO, HOUSEGUESTS.

08:44.524 --> 08:51.331
>> HI, JULIE!

08:51.364 --> 08:56.937
>> Julie: WELL, YOU'VE ALL
WONDERED, YOU'VE ALL SPECULATED,

08:56.970 --> 09:00.207
AND YOU HAVE FINALLY ARRIVED AT
DOUBLE EVICTION NIGHT.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.576
>> Julie: THAT'S RIGHT,
HOUSEGUESTS.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.944
BEFORE THE HOUR IS UP, TWO OF
YOU WILL BE EVICTED AND BECOME

09:03.977 --> 09:05.478
THE FIRST MEMBERS OF THE JURY.

09:05.512 --> 09:07.981
AND REMEMBER, THE TEMPTATION
COMPETITION IS OVER, WHICH MEANS

09:08.015 --> 09:10.350
EVERYONE IS FAIR GAME TONIGHT.

09:10.383 --> 09:14.387
WE BEGIN WITH THE FIRST LIVE
EVICTION.

09:14.421 --> 09:17.658
ELENA, CODY, MATT, IN JUST A FEW
MOMENTS, YOUR HOUSEMATES WILL

09:17.691 --> 09:18.992
CAST THEIR VOTES TO EVICT LIVE.

09:19.026 --> 09:22.462
BUT BEFORE THEY DO, YOU EACH
HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE TO SWAY

09:22.495 --> 09:24.732
THEIR VOTES WITH ONE BRIEF
STATEMENT.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.100
ELENA, YOU'RE FIRST.

09:27.134 --> 09:30.771
>> WE HAVE ALREADY CONCLUSIVELY
DETERMINED THAT IF IT'S FALSE,

09:30.804 --> 09:33.306
IT CANNOT BE A FACT.

09:33.340 --> 09:39.446
HOWEVER, AFTER ANOTHER WEEK'S
CONSIDERATION, I'D LIKE TO ADD

09:39.479 --> 09:42.616
THAT IF-- I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT--
SORRY, GUYS!

09:42.650 --> 09:46.253
I BLACK OUT!

09:46.286 --> 09:48.722
BEARING WITNESS TO FALSE
INFORMATION ISN'T ALL THAT

09:48.756 --> 09:49.823
CHALLENGING.

09:49.857 --> 09:53.560
NOW, AFTER ANOTHER WEEK'S
CONSIDERATION AGAIN, WE CAN

09:53.593 --> 09:56.964
DECIDE THAT DRIBBLING BACKWARDS
WOULD INCREASE DIFFICULTY.

09:56.997 --> 10:00.233
WITH THAT BEING SAID, MOMMY, I
LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.703
IF I'M STILL IN THE HOUSE ON
SATURDAY, PLEASE SPEND AS MUCH

10:02.736 --> 10:04.104
TIME ON LIVE FEED AS POSSIBLE.

10:04.137 --> 10:07.207
AND IN AN ACT OF FAITH, I'D LIKE
TO THANK THE HOUSEGUESTS FOR

10:07.240 --> 10:09.576
VOTING TO KEEP ME THIS WEEK.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.378
>> Julie: ALL RIGHT, THANK
YOU, ELENA.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.713
>> THANK YOU, JULIE.

10:12.746 --> 10:13.513
>> Julie: CODY, YOU'RE UP?

10:13.546 --> 10:15.649
>> DO I HAVE TIME?

10:15.683 --> 10:19.152
PACE PAISLY, I LOVE YOU, MISS
YOU.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.054
JESSICA YOU'RE THE GREATEST GIFT
IN THE GAME.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.957
TO MY FELLOW 3-11s.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.660

10:29.096 --> 10:31.564
SHE AND JASON TRIED TO FLIP THE

10:31.598 --> 10:34.567
THEY CAME WITH TWO PLANS, ONE TO
PUT YOU UP MATT.

10:34.601 --> 10:37.404
SHE TOLD YOU ABOUT THE
CONVERSATION YOU HAD ABOUT MY.

10:37.437 --> 10:40.073
THE SECOND PLAN WAS TO GET YOU
OUT, PAUL, AND AT THE END, THEY

10:40.107 --> 10:43.576
TOLD ME THAT THEY'RE GOING TO
PUT ME UP AND WAIT UNTIL THIS

10:43.610 --> 10:49.917

14:40.847 --> 14:43.150

14:43.183 --> 14:44.717
THEY DIDN'T COME TO ME WITH
THOSE PLANS.

14:44.751 --> 14:47.087
I-- I DID THAT FOR JESSICA.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.923
>> Julie: SO YOU PRETTY MUCH
KNEW YOU WERE DEAD MAN WALKING

14:49.957 --> 14:51.258
AND YOU THOUGHT, WHAT?

14:51.291 --> 14:52.993
BEFORE I LEAVE I'M JUST GOING
TO--

14:53.026 --> 14:56.496
>> RIGHT, BECAUSE EVERYONE IS
PLAYING IT SAFE IN THERE.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.731
NOBODY IS GOING AFTER EACH
OTHER.

14:58.765 --> 15:02.102
I'VE BEEN GONE AFTER FOR SEVEN
WEEKS NOW, BOTH ME AND JESSICA.

15:02.135 --> 15:05.138
IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY STIRRED
SOMETHING UP.

15:05.172 --> 15:08.141
>> Julie: WHY DIDN'T YOU
CREATE THOSEALIZE LYES WHILE YOU

15:08.175 --> 15:10.477
WERE--
>> THEY WOULD HAVE NEVER

15:10.510 --> 15:11.311
BELIEVED ME.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.446
I TO DO IT GOING OUT THE DOOR.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.982
I HAD NO INFLUENCE IN THE GAME.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.650
>> Julie: THIS PAST WEEK,
WITH JESSICA GONE, WE DID SEE

15:17.684 --> 15:21.488
YOU OPEN UP ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL
LIFE, FOR EXAMPLE, TELLING KEVIN

15:21.521 --> 15:22.022
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.156
>> RIGHT.

15:23.190 --> 15:26.393
>> Julie: AND THAT LOOKED
LIKE THAT HELPED YOU MAKE SOME

15:26.426 --> 15:27.260
INROADS.

15:27.294 --> 15:30.263
WHY DIDN'T YOU TRY THAT APPROACH
EARLIER?

15:30.297 --> 15:31.731
>> IT WAS NEVER A STRATEGY.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.434
WITH MY DAUGHTER, KEVIN WAS
HAVING A HARD TIME THIS WEEK

15:34.467 --> 15:35.668
WITH HIS FAMILY.

15:35.702 --> 15:39.472
I WANTED TO KEEP MY DAUGHTER,
THE INFORMATION ABOUT HER, LIKE,

15:39.506 --> 15:42.342
TO MYSELF, BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE
USING ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING

15:42.375 --> 15:43.476
PERSONAL AGAINST EACH OTHER.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.645
AND IF THEY WERE TO USE MY
DAUGHTER AGAINST ME, IT WOULD

15:45.678 --> 15:46.913
HAVE SET ME OFF.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.281
>> Julie: WE DON'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.249
>> OH, GOSH.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.050
NOT LIKE THAT.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.884
IT'S NOT LIKE I WASN'T IN
CONTROL.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.520
>> Julie: NO, I KNOW.

15:53.553 --> 15:54.521
BUT OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.990
YOU DIDN'T PLAY A SOCIAL GAME.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.825
WHY COULDN'T BE PHONY A LITTLE
BIT?

15:58.858 --> 15:59.492
>> THESE PEOPLE.

15:59.526 --> 16:00.427
I CAN'T STAND THEM.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.095
I HATE ALL OF THEM.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.296
THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD BE FAKE

16:03.330 --> 16:04.431
TO THEM.

16:04.464 --> 16:10.703
AFTER 50-SOME-ODD DAYS THERE WAS
NO WAY I COULD BE FAKE.

16:10.737 --> 16:11.938
>> Julie: FINAL THOUGHTS?

16:11.971 --> 16:14.841
>> I WANT TO SEE JESSICA AND MY
DAUGHTER.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.043
>> Julie: ARE YOU GOING TO
MARRY JESSICA.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.077
>> I WILL.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.778
SORRY, I WASN'T GOING TO SAY IT.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.348
>> Julie: SHE'S PROBABLY
SCREAMING AT HOME WATCHING RIGHT

16:21.381 --> 16:22.215
NOW.

16:22.249 --> 16:22.849
>> Julie: YOU'RE OFF TO THE
JURY HOUSE.

16:22.882 --> 16:23.683
YOU KNOW THAT.

16:23.716 --> 16:24.584
>> COOL.

16:24.617 --> 16:27.320
>> Julie: YOU PROBABLY WANT
SOME SOLITUDE.

16:27.354 --> 16:30.390
>> NOW IT'S A DOUBLE EVICTION,
SO YOU SCREWED THAT UP.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.859
>> Julie: I DID FORGET THAT,
DIDN'T I?

16:32.892 --> 16:34.761
WELL, WE WILL SEE YOU BACK HERE

16:34.794 --> 16:38.431

IT WAS GOOD TO TALK TO YOU.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.935
>> Julie: THANK YOU, CODY.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.171
STATE RIGHT THERE.

16:44.204 --> 16:47.340

17:40.059 --> 17:42.329
WELCOME TO THE B.B. CRUISE
LINES.

17:42.362 --> 17:46.599
THIS COMPETITION IS CALLED "LET
IT SLIDE," AND IT'S PLAYED IN

17:46.633 --> 17:48.535
THE CLASSIC "BIG BROTHER"
ELIMINATOR STYLE.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.971
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

17:52.004 --> 17:56.943
TWO AT A TIME, PLAYERS WILL FACE
OFF AGAINST EACH OTHER, AND IN

17:56.976 --> 17:59.612
SHUFFLE BOARD STYLE, SLIDE THEIR
DISC DOWN THE BOARD.

17:59.646 --> 18:03.716
THE PLAYER WHOSE DISC LANDS
CLOSEST TO THE BACK EDGE WITHOUT

18:10.190 --> 18:13.193
THE LOSER OF EACH ROUND WILL BE

18:29.442 --> 18:31.478
>> YES.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.712
>> Julie: OKAY.

18:32.745 --> 18:40.220
AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE IS A WALL
BETWEEN YOU, SO YOU CANNOT SEE

18:40.253 --> 18:41.020
HOW THE OTHER PLAYER DOES.

18:41.053 --> 18:43.390
BOTH PLAYERS MUST SHOOT ON MY

YOU HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.399
MARK, PICK THE NEXT TWO TO FACE
OFF.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.967
>> CHRISTMAS AND KEV.

20:35.001 --> 20:40.940
>> Julie: CHRISTMAS AND
KEVIN.

20:40.973 --> 20:44.143
ALL RIGHT, GET READY.

20:44.176 --> 20:46.413
GET SET.

20:46.446 --> 20:52.719
GO.

20:52.752 --> 20:53.252
OOOH.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.220
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

20:54.253 --> 20:54.821
SORRY, KEVIN.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.523
YOU HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.559
CHRISTMAS, GO AHEAD AND PICK THE
NEXT TWO TO FACE OFF.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.828
>> MARK AND JASON.

21:01.861 --> 21:07.767
>> Julie: MARK AND JASON.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.336
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.037
GET READY.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.972
GET SET.

21:13.005 --> 21:16.909
GO.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.078
SORRY, MARK.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.381
YOU HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

21:21.414 --> 21:27.554
AND SINCE WE ONLY HAVE TWO
PEOPLE LEFT, CHRISTMAS AND PAUL,

21:27.587 --> 21:29.889
CHRISTMAS, YOU MUST FACE OFF
AGAINST PAUL BECAUSE THERE'S

21:29.922 --> 21:31.691
ONLY THE TWO OF YOU LEFT.

21:31.724 --> 21:38.164
OTHER THAN JASON, OF COURSE, WHO
JUST WENT.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.699
>> GOOD LUCK, BABY.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.869
>> Julie: GET YOURSELVES
SITUATED.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.771
CHRISTMAS AND PAUL.

21:44.804 --> 21:45.838

21:45.872 --> 21:46.072

21:46.105 --> 21:50.477
GO.

21:50.510 --> 21:54.246
>> AH!

21:54.280 --> 21:57.016
>> Julie: PAUL, YOU HAVE BEEN
ELIMINATED.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.951
JASON, STEP ON UP.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.252
GRAB A DISK.

22:00.286 --> 22:06.325
CHRISTMAS, GRAB YOUR DISK.

22:06.359 --> 22:07.326
CHRISTMAS, JASON.

22:07.360 --> 22:11.798
ONE OF YOU IS ABOUT TO BECOME
H.O.H.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.232
GET READY.

22:13.265 --> 22:15.935
GET SET.

22:15.968 --> 22:24.711
GO.

22:24.744 --> 22:29.281
>> Julie: CONGRATULATIONS,
JASON!

22:29.315 --> 22:37.624
ALL RIGHT, JASON.

22:37.657 --> 22:38.691
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.

22:38.725 --> 22:42.128
YOU HAVE JUST A FEW MINUTES TO
STRATEGIZE.

22:42.161 --> 22:45.532
SO I NEED EVERYONE TO HEAD
INSIDE RIGHT NOW, AND I'LL BE

22:45.565 --> 22:53.640
BACK FOR YOUR DECISION VERY
SHORTLY, JASON.

22:53.673 --> 22:59.111
UP NEXT, JASON MUST NOMINATE TWO
HOUSEGUESTS FOR EVICTION.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.212
WHO WILL HE PUT ON THE BLOCK?

23:00.246 --> 23:01.481
AND WHO WILL BE THE SECOND
HOUSEGUEST EVICTED TONIGHT?

23:01.514 --> 23:03.583
STAY WITH US.

23:04.851 --> 23:05.251
.

23:05.284 --> 23:05.552
>> OH, DID YOU?

23:05.585 --> 23:08.721
>> YEAH.

23:08.755 --> 23:11.424
>> GOOD JOB.

23:11.458 --> 23:14.861
>> BYEEE!

23:14.894 --> 23:17.997
BYEEE!

23:22.802 --> 23:26.372
>> I KNOW, LISTEN, I'LL GIVE A
SPEECH.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.206
I'M GOING TO GIVE A SPEECH.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.376
YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO GIVE A
SPEECH.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.045
>> YEAH, I'M FINE.

23:33.079 --> 23:36.849
>> IT'S NERVE-RACKING, BUT I'M
GOING TO GIVE A SPEECH.

23:36.883 --> 23:37.450
IT WILL BE FINE.

23:37.484 --> 23:38.685
IT WILL BE FINE.

23:38.718 --> 23:39.486
HOW MUCH TIME WE GOT?

23:39.519 --> 23:40.687
>> NO TIME.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.221
THAT'S IT.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.658
>> OKAY.

23:45.692 --> 23:48.394
>> GOOD JOB, HOMEY.

23:48.427 --> 23:48.828
VETO.

23:48.861 --> 23:53.099
YOU'RE PLAYING.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.835
>> GOOD JOB, BABY GIRL.

23:55.868 --> 24:08.347
* *
>> MARK AND ELENA.

24:08.380 --> 24:12.919
>> I DIDN'T WANT TO BE--
>> NO, I NOW YOU HAVE TO BE

24:12.952 --> 24:13.452
STRONG.

24:13.486 --> 24:14.621
YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.824
>> YOUR LETTER, YOUR WIFE--
>> NOW, YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.592
EXECUTE, THAT'S IT.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.861
>> I HAVE TO GET MY THOUGHTS
TOGETHER HERE.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.530
>> BREATHE.

24:23.563 --> 24:26.899
* *
FOCUS.

24:26.933 --> 24:27.734
BREATHE.

24:27.767 --> 24:32.939
>> NOBODY LISTENED TO WHAT CODY
SAID.

24:32.972 --> 24:37.043
THEY'VE BOTH BEEN CHATTING IT UP
FOR STRATEGY.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.078
>> I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.198
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO "BIG
BROTHER."

24:59.231 --> 25:03.235
JUST MOMENTS AGO, JASON BECAME
THE NEW HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

25:03.269 --> 25:04.403
IT IS NOW HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO
PUT TWO HOUSEGUESTS ON THE

25:04.436 --> 25:06.973
CHOPPING BLOCK.

25:07.006 --> 25:11.477
LET'S HEAD TO THE LIVING ROOM
FOR THE LIVE NOMINATION

25:11.510 --> 25:14.781
HOUSEGUESTS, I SEE YOU'RE ALL
THERE GATHERED.

25:14.814 --> 25:19.385
AS YOU KNOW, IT IS TIME FOR THE
LIVE NOMINATION CEREMONY TO

25:19.418 --> 25:20.519
BEGIN.

25:20.553 --> 25:21.621
JASON, AS HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD, IT
IS NOW TIME TO FACE YOUR

25:21.654 --> 25:24.691
HOUSEMATES AND MAKE YOUR TWO
NOMINATIONS.

25:24.724 --> 25:25.825
PLEASE STAND AND TAKE IT AWAY.

25:25.858 --> 25:32.498
>> ALL RIGHT, THANKS, JULIE.

25:32.531 --> 25:36.035
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO NOMINATE
YOU, MARK, AND YOU, ELENA.

25:36.068 --> 25:39.906
MARK, FROM DAY ONE, WE'VE BEEN--
WE'VE BEEN BOYS.

25:39.939 --> 25:44.243
BUT IN THE LAST WEEK AND A HALF,
WHEN I WAS SERIOUSLY ON THE

25:44.276 --> 25:47.113
FENCE, CODY WAS IN ONE EAR
TELLING ME THAT YOU-- YOU AND

25:47.146 --> 25:50.216
HER CANNOT BE TRUSTED 100%, NO
MATTER WHAT.

25:50.249 --> 25:52.518
EVERYTHING YOU SAY WAS A LIE,
AND NOT TO TRUST YOU, NO MATTER

25:52.551 --> 25:55.087
AND LITERALLY, I WALKED FROM
OUTSIDE TO INSIDE, WE PLAYED

25:55.121 --> 25:56.288
CHESS.

25:56.322 --> 25:58.725
AND YOU SAID, "IF WE DON'T MAKE
A BIG MOVE NOW, WE'RE NEVER

25:58.758 --> 26:02.662
GOING TO GET HIM OUT."

26:02.695 --> 26:05.665
AND IF YOU TWO CAN'T BE ON THE
SAME PAGE, MY MAN, I CAN'T GET

26:05.698 --> 26:06.799
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

26:06.833 --> 26:10.136
WE ARE GOING TO BE, NEW YEAR'S
EVE, TOGETHER.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.938
WE'RE GOING TO FORGET ABOUT
THIS.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.306
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE IT'S GOING TO
BE A DIFFERENTISTIC BUT I'M

26:14.340 --> 26:17.509
SORRY, I HAVE TO NOMINATE YOU AS
ONE FOR EVICTION.

26:17.543 --> 26:19.979
ELENA, I GOT NO BEEF WITH YOU,
BABE.

26:20.012 --> 26:22.481
I'M COMING TO YOUR HOUSE AS
WELL.

26:22.514 --> 26:24.050
WE'RE A RODEO FAMILY.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.719
BUT ALEX IS MY GIRL IN HERE.

26:26.753 --> 26:30.589
SHE'S MY TIGER, MY SIDEKICK, AND
I JUST CAN'T HAVE SOMEBODY

26:30.623 --> 26:34.393
MAKING A DEAL WITH HER,
POINTBLANK, AND LITERALLY GOING

26:34.426 --> 26:35.594
AGAINST IT THAT QUICK LATER.

26:35.628 --> 26:38.665
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST ONE OF THEM
THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE

26:38.698 --> 26:42.902
EVERYTHING THAT COMES INTO
CONSIDERATION AND IT HAS TO BE

26:42.935 --> 26:44.136
QUICK.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.706
AND YOU LITERALLY HAVE NOT MUCH
TO GO ON, AND I'M SORRY IT HAD

26:46.739 --> 26:51.410
TO GO DOWN THIS WAY, BUT YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO TACK A SEAT

26:51.443 --> 26:52.211
NEXT TO MARK.

26:52.244 --> 26:53.412
I HAVE NO TARGET.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.614
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LET THE
HOUSE DECIDE WHO THEY WANT IN

26:55.648 --> 26:57.149
AND WHO THEY WANT OUT.

26:57.183 --> 26:58.685
>> Julie: THANK YOU, JASON.

26:58.718 --> 27:05.024
ALL RIGHT, ELENA, MARK, ONE OF
YOU MAY BE THE NEXT HOUSEGUEST

27:05.057 --> 27:07.894
TO BE EVICTED.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.929
BUT YOU STILL HAVE ONE LAST
CHANCE TO SAVE YOURSELVES.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.231
THE LIVE VETO COMPETITION IS
NEXT.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.867
UP NEXT, WHO WILL WIN THE POWER
OF VETO?

27:14.901 --> 27:16.669
AND WILL IT BE USED TO SAVE ONE
OF THE TWO NOMINEES?

27:16.703 --> 27:19.138
STAY WITH US.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.431
SPECIAL DOUBLE-EVICTION EPISODE
OF "BIG BROTHER."

27:45.464 --> 27:46.799
ALREADY TONIGHT, CODY WAS
EVICTED FROM THE "BIG BROTHER"

27:46.833 --> 27:47.900
HOUSE.

27:47.934 --> 27:56.575
THEN JASON BECAME THE NEW HEAD
OF HOUSEHOLD.

27:56.608 --> 27:57.844
HE THEN PUT ELENA AND MARK UP
FOR EVICTION.

27:57.877 --> 28:00.279

LET'S HEAD TO THE BACKYARD AND
BEGIN.

HOUSEGUESTS, IT IS NOW TIME FOR

THE WINNER OF THE POWER OF VETO
CAN USE IT TO REMOVE ONE OF THE

NOMINEES FROM THE CHOPPING
BLOCK OR THEY CAN LEAVE JASON'S

28:25.805 --> 28:27.673
NOMINATIONS INTACT.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.075
THIS COMPETITION IS CALLED

34:00.172 --> 34:01.473
>> WELCOME BACK!

34:01.507 --> 34:03.242

34:03.275 --> 34:05.043

YOU, JASON.

34:05.077 --> 34:10.249
I'LL BE BACK FOR THE SECOND LIVE
VOTE AND EVICTION IN JUST A FEW

34:10.282 --> 34:10.816
MINUTES.

34:10.849 --> 34:12.684
UP NEXT, ELENA OR MATT?

34:12.718 --> 34:16.622
WHO WILL BE THE NEXT HOUSEGUEST
TO LEAVE THE "BIG BROTHER"

34:16.655 --> 34:17.423
HOUSE?

34:17.456 --> 34:17.956
THE LIVE VOTE AND EVICTION IS
NEXT.

34:17.989 --> 34:18.790
STAY WITH US.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.077
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO

34:39.111 --> 34:41.813
IT'S BEEN A CRAZY NIGHT IN THE
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.916
EARLIER THIS EVENING, CODY WAS
EVICTED.

34:44.950 --> 34:47.052
NOW, EITHER ELENA OR MATT WILL
FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.856
LET'S RETURN TO THE LIVING ROOM
FOR THE LIVE VOTE AND EVICTION.

34:50.889 --> 34:55.594
HOUSEGUESTS, ELENA, MATT, IN
JUST A FEW MOMENTS, YOUR

34:55.627 --> 34:57.596
HOUSEMATES WILL CAST THEIR VOTES
TO EVICT LIVE.

34:57.629 --> 35:00.299
BUT BEFORE THEY DO, YOU EACH
HAVE A FINAL CHANCE TO SWAY

35:00.332 --> 35:02.401
THEIR VOTES WITH ONE BRIEF
STATEMENT.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.902
ELENA, YOU'RE FIRST.

35:03.935 --> 35:07.706
>> SEE IF I CAN REMEMBER HOW TO
TALK THIS TIME.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.709
I ACTUALLY DON'T REALLY HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY TO YOU GUYS.

35:10.742 --> 35:14.112
BUT, MOM, I THINK IT IS TIME FOR
LILY TO GET HER TEETH CLEANED,

35:14.146 --> 35:17.549
SO IF YOU WANT TO SET UP THAT
APPOINTMENT BEFORE I HEAD BACK

35:17.583 --> 35:18.750
HOME.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.420
I WILL BE SPENDING MY BIRTHDAY
IN THE JURY HOUSE, VERY DRUNK

35:21.453 --> 35:22.120
WITHOUT YOU.

35:22.154 --> 35:27.359
I'LL THINK OF YOU ALL DAY LONG.

35:27.393 --> 35:27.993
I LOVE YOU TO THE MOON AND BACK.

35:28.026 --> 35:28.627
AND, YEAH, THAT'S ALL.

35:28.660 --> 35:29.561
>> Julie: THANK YOU, ELENA.

35:29.595 --> 35:30.229
MATT.

35:30.262 --> 35:31.363
>> ELENA, I LOVE TO YOU DEATH.

35:31.397 --> 35:34.600
IN CASE YOU GUYS HAVEN'T
GUESSED, I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO

35:34.633 --> 35:38.103
EAT 400 BOWLS OF CEREAL IN THE
LAST 30 MINUTES.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.507
I STILL NEED TIME TO DO THAT.

35:41.540 --> 35:42.007
>> Julie: THANK YOU.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.009
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

35:44.042 --> 35:46.077
IT'S TIME FOR THE LIVE VOTING TO
BEGIN.

35:46.111 --> 35:48.447
JASON, AS HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD YOU
ARE NOT ALLOWED TO VOTE.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.681
NEITHER ARE THE TWO NOMINEES.

35:49.715 --> 35:53.619
ONE AT A TIME, THE REST OF YOU

35:56.388 --> 36:00.926
PLEASE GO TO THE DIARY ROOM.

36:00.959 --> 36:03.629
RAVEN IS IN A SHOWMANCE WITH
MATT.

36:03.662 --> 36:06.232
HER VOTE SHOULD BE OBVIOUS.

36:06.265 --> 36:06.632
HI, RAVEN.

36:06.665 --> 36:07.933
>> HEY, JULIE.

36:14.740 --> 36:18.377
>> Julie: WILL THIS BE ALEX'S
CHANCE TO TAKE REVENGE ON ELENA

36:18.410 --> 36:21.313
FOR STEALING THE $5,000?

36:21.347 --> 36:21.713
HI, ALEX.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.081
>> HI, JULIE!

36:23.114 --> 36:24.983

36:25.016 --> 36:31.122
>> I VOTE TO EVICT ELENA.

36:31.156 --> 36:34.360
>> Julie: MARK KNOWS HE'S A
TARGET, SO WHO IS HIS BIGGEST

36:34.393 --> 36:37.929
THREAT?

36:37.963 --> 36:38.464
HI, MARK.

36:38.497 --> 36:39.765

ELENA OUT OF THE HOUSE.

36:49.040 --> 36:52.311
WILL HE TAKE HIS SHOT TONIGHT?

36:52.344 --> 36:53.011
HI, JOSH.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.247
>> HI, JULIE.

36:55.281 --> 36:56.882
>> Julie: PLEASE CAST YOUR
VOTE TO EVICT.

36:56.915 --> 37:00.552
>> I SADLY VOTE TO EVICT MY
FIFTH GRADE CRUSH, ELENA.

37:00.586 --> 37:01.219
>> Julie: THANK YOU.

37:01.253 --> 37:03.188
>> THANK YOU.

37:03.221 --> 37:06.458
>> Julie: WITH CODY OUT OF
THE GAME, WHO DOES PAUL SEE AS

37:06.492 --> 37:09.928
HIS BIGGEST THREAT NOW?

37:09.961 --> 37:10.329
HI, PAUL.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.897
>> HEY, JULIE.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.532

37:17.836 --> 37:18.970

37:19.004 --> 37:22.974
WITH FOUR VOTES TO EVICT ELENA,
ELENA WILL LEAVE THE HOUSE

37:23.008 --> 37:23.842
TONIGHT.

37:23.875 --> 37:29.147
BUT LET'S SEE HOW THE OTHER
VOTES FALL.

37:29.180 --> 37:29.948

38:03.649 --> 38:04.716

ARE IN.

38:04.750 --> 38:10.856
LET'S GIVE THE NEWS TO THE
HOUSEGUESTS.

38:10.889 --> 38:14.393
HOUSEGUESTS, JUST A REMINDER,
WHEN I REVEAL THE VOTE, THE

38:14.426 --> 38:17.329
EVICTED HOUSEGUEST WILL HAVE
JUST A FEW MOMENTS TO SAY GONE

38:17.363 --> 38:19.598
AND WALK OUT THE FRONT DOOR.

38:19.631 --> 38:26.137
BY A VOTE OF 6-1, ELENA, YOU ARE
EVICTED FROM THE "BIG BROTHER"

38:26.171 --> 38:33.545
HOUSE.

38:33.579 --> 38:36.682
>> I GOT HER BAG.

38:36.715 --> 38:39.184
>> DON'T HOLD IT AGAINST ME TOO
LONG.

38:39.217 --> 38:46.224
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU.

38:46.257 --> 38:46.958
BYE.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.294
>> GIVE ME A KISS.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.596
>> I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

38:50.629 --> 38:52.130
>> OKAY.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.198
>> BYE, LOVE YOU.

38:53.231 --> 38:54.866
>> LOVE YOU, TOO.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.636
>> BY, ELENA.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.805
>> LOVE YOU, ELENA!

38:59.838 --> 39:02.574
>> HEY, JULIE!

39:02.608 --> 39:05.143
>> Julie: HI, ELENA.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.413
HOW ARE YOU?

39:07.446 --> 39:09.247
>> GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?

39:09.280 --> 39:10.416
HI!

39:10.449 --> 39:14.185
>> CONGRATULATIONS ON SURVIVING
DOUBLE EVICTION, FRIENDS.

39:14.219 --> 39:18.390
>> I HAD NO CHOICE.

39:18.424 --> 39:22.093
>> THAT'S THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

39:22.127 --> 39:27.633
>> OH, IT'S ALREADY GRAY!

39:27.666 --> 39:29.901
>> YOU'RE NOT A HAVE-NOT.

39:29.935 --> 39:32.137
>> Julie: WELL, ELENA YOU
SURVIVED THE FIRST EVICTION OF

39:32.170 --> 39:32.704
THE NIGHT.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.172
THIS TIME, NOT SO LUCKY.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.742
WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE NEXT
ON THE LIST TO EVICT?

39:36.775 --> 39:41.079
>> YOU KNOW, CODY AND JESS WERE
NEVER GOOD FOR MY GAME.

39:41.112 --> 39:43.782
I REALLY ACTUALLY LOVE JESSICA
SO MUCH.

39:43.815 --> 39:47.819
AND MY ASSOCIATION WITH MARK AND
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH CODY, I

39:47.853 --> 39:50.255
PRETTY WELL KNEW IF IT WASN'T
TONIGHT IT WOULD BE IN THE NEXT

39:50.288 --> 39:53.459
COUPLE OF WEEKS THAT I WAS GOING
TO BE A TARGET.

39:53.492 --> 39:54.593
SO...

39:54.626 --> 39:56.795
>> Julie: AND THERE WAS
NOTHING YOU COULD DO SOCIALLY TO

39:56.828 --> 39:57.696
TURN IT AROUND?

39:57.729 --> 39:59.898
>> YOU KNOW, YOU KIND OF JUST
HIT A WALL.

39:59.931 --> 40:03.469
LIKE, WHEN THERE'S AN EASY
TARGET, IT'S EASIER FOR THEM TO

40:03.502 --> 40:04.470
PLAY THAT GAME.

40:04.503 --> 40:07.038
NOBODY WANTED TO MAKE A BIG MOVE
OR DO ANYTHING.

40:07.072 --> 40:10.742
SO THE SMALL TARGET ON MY BACK
JUST INCREASED, INCREASED,

40:10.776 --> 40:13.344
INCREASED, AND HERE I AM.

40:13.378 --> 40:15.013
>> Julie: LET'S TALK ABOUT
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH MARK.

40:15.046 --> 40:15.947
>> OH, LORD!

40:15.981 --> 40:17.148
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.

40:17.182 --> 40:19.751
>> Julie: BECAUSE THE TWO OF
YOU GOT ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED

40:19.785 --> 40:25.223
PRETTY EARLY IN THE GAME BUT
THEN, SOMETIMES YOU JUST DIDN'T

40:25.256 --> 40:27.626
SEEM LIKE YOU WERE THAT INTO
HIM.

40:27.659 --> 40:28.827
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT MARK?

40:28.860 --> 40:32.330
>> MARK WILL BE VERY EXCITED
TO-- WELL, NOT KNOW THIS BECAUSE

40:32.363 --> 40:36.401
I DON'T THINK HE'S WATCHING--
THAT I DO LIKE HIM.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.905
HOWEVER, THE-- THE "BIG BROTHER"
HOUSE ENVIRONMENT ISN'T MY

40:39.938 --> 40:41.673
FAVORITE TO EXPLORE A
RELATIONSHIP IN.

40:41.707 --> 40:44.943
I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S MENTALLY
OR EMOTIONALLY HEALTHY FOR ME.

40:44.976 --> 40:46.978
>> Julie: ARE YOU GOING TO
EXPLORE IT OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

40:47.012 --> 40:48.213
WITH HIM?

40:48.246 --> 40:51.116
>> I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I ALWAYS
SAY-- I AM OPEN TO THE THINGS

40:51.149 --> 40:54.285
THE LORD HAS FOR ME.

40:54.319 --> 41:00.458
AND I PROMISE HIM I WILL HAVE A
DATE WITH HIM IN DALLAS THANK

41:00.492 --> 41:03.061
YOU, JEWEL GLE STAY RIGHT THERE
IN THAT CHAIR.

41:03.094 --> 41:06.064
NINE HOUSEGUESTS REMAIN IN THE
BATTLE FOR A HALF MILLION

41:06.097 --> 41:08.600
DOLLARS, AND WE HAVE A LOT MORE
IN STORE FOR YOU THIS WEEK.

41:08.634 --> 41:12.170

41:18.243 --> 41:19.444
SURPRISES THE HOUSEGUESTS.

41:19.477 --> 41:22.914
THEN SUNDAY, SEE WHO WILL BECOME
THE NEW HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD AND

41:22.948 --> 41:25.483
WHICH TWO HOUSEGUESTS WILL BE
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION.

41:25.517 --> 41:29.020
AND WITH THE TEMPTATION
COMPETITION OVER, A NEW

41:29.054 --> 41:31.256
TEMPTATION TWIST WILL BE
UNLEASHED INTO THE GAME.

41:31.289 --> 41:34.560
AND ON WEDNESDAY, THE POWER OF
VETO HOLDS THE POWER TO SAVE ONE

41:34.593 --> 41:36.394
OF THE TWO NOMINEES.

41:36.427 --> 41:40.866
THEN, ONE WEEK FROM TONIGHT,
I'LL BE BACK FOR THE NEXT LIVE

41:40.899 --> 41:42.267
EVICTION WHERE ANOTHER
HOUSEGUEST WILL BE SENT TO THE

41:42.300 --> 41:43.201
JURY HOUSE.

41:43.234 --> 41:46.037
FOR NOW, LET'S EAVESDROP ON THE
HOUSEGUESTS.

41:46.071 --> 41:49.440
FROM OUTSIDE THE "BIG BROTHER"
HOUSE WITH ELENA, I'M JULIE

41:49.474 --> 41:49.908
CHEN.

41:49.941 --> 41:51.677
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

42:03.922 --> 42:04.522
BECAUSE I GOT SHAKY AT THE END.

42:04.556 --> 42:05.056
IT WAS ME AND YOU, RIGHT?

42:05.090 --> 42:05.691
>> YES.

42:05.724 --> 42:06.457
>> HOW CLAUS CLOSEWERE YOU?

42:06.491 --> 42:07.025
>> I DON'T THINK I WAS THAT
CLOSE.

42:07.058 --> 42:08.126
>> BECAUSE I WAS SHAKY.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.061
>> BECAUSE I HAD THE TWO LITTLE
ONES IN THE TOP LEFT.

42:10.095 --> 42:13.965
>> MATT AND I WERE STILL ON THE
FIRST ONE TOGETHER.

42:13.999 --> 42:17.468
>> I KNEW I WAS GOING TO GO
OVER, SO I THOUGHT I'LL TONE IT

42:17.502 --> 42:18.403
DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

42:18.436 --> 42:19.470
TOO MUCH!

42:19.504 --> 42:25.744
>> I DIDN'T SEE HOW FAR--
>> I GOT YOU COVERED, "BIG

42:25.777 --> 42:26.411
BROTHER."

42:26.444 --> 42:27.445
I GOT YOU COVERED.

42:27.478 --> 42:29.848
>> NOT THE WHOLE THING, THE
FIRST PUZZLE.

42:29.881 --> 42:43.394
THE FIRST PUZZLE.

42:43.428 --> 42:46.898
>>
OH, MY GOSH, DOUBLE EVICTIONS

42:53.872 --> 42:55.874
ARE NOT GOOD.
