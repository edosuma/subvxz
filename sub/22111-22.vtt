00:03.742 --> 00:04.656
ERIC:
Earlier this morning,

00:04.700 --> 00:05.570
Secret Service
used a covert team

00:05.614 --> 00:07.442
to pick up Claudia Diaz

00:07.485 --> 00:08.834
and brought her
to the boatshed.

00:08.878 --> 00:09.966
NELL: Agent DeChamps
has been undercover,

00:10.010 --> 00:11.837
targeting the Marca family.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.056
Who is this guy,
Michael Silva?

00:13.100 --> 00:14.536
DeCHAMPS: An American with Peruvian ties.

00:14.579 --> 00:16.668
It looks like he also helps
vet the deals.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.583
They're expecting financial
genius, not drug dealer.

00:18.627 --> 00:20.324
Reclusive, nervous.
I got this.

00:20.368 --> 00:21.325
Kids are awful.

00:21.369 --> 00:22.631
Guess that's why I'm like this.

00:22.674 --> 00:25.634
Sokolov! Put your hands up.

00:30.073 --> 00:32.902
Anna, where's his gun?

00:37.515 --> 00:41.128
♪ Hell I'm running

00:41.171 --> 00:44.653
♪ From the sound of my own

00:44.696 --> 00:48.048
♪ Two feet...

00:54.358 --> 00:56.578
♪ These dreams, they tell me

00:56.621 --> 00:59.668
♪ No matter where and why

00:59.711 --> 01:03.454
♪ I won't be free

01:10.374 --> 01:12.376
♪

01:31.526 --> 01:32.831
♪

02:01.643 --> 02:03.819
♪

02:26.407 --> 02:29.018
Oh, wait a minute. You won't
take home Post-it notes

02:29.061 --> 02:31.803
from the office, but you'll take
partsfrom the boatshed?

02:31.847 --> 02:34.806
First of all, these parts
have been here forever.

02:34.850 --> 02:37.635
And second, Hetty said I can
have anything in here I needed.

02:37.679 --> 02:40.290
Are her gold bricks
from Vietnam in here?That's funny.

02:40.334 --> 02:42.031
I just picked up a raw
water pump for my boat,

02:42.074 --> 02:43.250
but they didn't have a bracket.

02:43.293 --> 02:46.166
Ah. Thank you.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.603
Well, don't get used
to this kind of service.

02:48.646 --> 02:50.779
Turned out the new
coffee place had smoothies.

02:50.822 --> 02:53.173
Mmm. It's good.

02:53.216 --> 02:54.696
And you're out of the house
early today.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.176
Yep.
Why?

02:56.219 --> 02:57.829
Mm, no reason.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.614
Early workout?
No.

02:59.657 --> 03:00.789
Couldn't sleep?

03:00.832 --> 03:02.573
I actually slept like a rock.

03:02.617 --> 03:05.707
So you just felt like we needed
a little more one

03:05.750 --> 03:09.058
Like us being together over
300 days a year isn't enough.

03:09.101 --> 03:12.235
I got up this morning
to try meditation.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.845
Come on.

03:13.889 --> 03:16.413
Let's hear it.
What do you got?

03:18.459 --> 03:20.461
Nothing.
I think it's great.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.289
What made you decide
to give it a try?

03:22.332 --> 03:23.855
I don't know, critical mass.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.988
When everyone from
Hetty to my accountant

03:26.031 --> 03:28.773
to the guy that sells oranges
on the freeway off-ramp tell me

03:28.817 --> 03:31.689
that meditation's the truth,
I thought, I'm open-minded,

03:31.733 --> 03:32.864
I'll-I'll give it a try.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.431
Did it change your life?

03:34.475 --> 03:35.867
I kind of like my life
the way it is.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.173
But, like I said,
I'm open-minded,

03:37.217 --> 03:38.827
so I downloaded the app,
I got into a quiet room,

03:38.870 --> 03:39.741
and I went for it.

03:39.784 --> 03:41.656
Well, good for you.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.658
Meditation takes a lot of work,
and you have to

03:43.701 --> 03:45.355
put in some time.I'm kind of finished already.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.792
Finished

03:47.836 --> 03:49.751
Mm-hmm.
I guess I'm a natural.

03:49.794 --> 03:52.101
How long did you do it for?

03:52.144 --> 03:53.276
Two minutes.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.973
Yeah, I got that
clear, empty mind,

03:55.017 --> 03:56.888
and I fell asleep,
like a rock.

03:56.932 --> 03:59.848
Kind of like before
I did meditation.

04:01.763 --> 04:04.592
I'm not sure two minutes is
considered "meditation."

04:04.635 --> 04:07.203
You might need to try
and give it a little longer.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.900
Do I?

04:08.944 --> 04:11.555
Or did it only
take me two minutes

04:11.599 --> 04:13.122
to master meditation?

04:13.165 --> 04:16.560
Is this boat ready
for the open water yet?

04:16.604 --> 04:19.302
It's a work in progress, okay?

04:19.346 --> 04:21.391
I want things nice for when
Kam and Aiden

04:21.435 --> 04:22.914
come home from school.

04:22.958 --> 04:25.308
You still gonna
take it up the coast?

04:25.352 --> 04:29.573
Carmel. That's where Michelle
would want to be.

04:29.617 --> 04:32.576
Well, if you need help getting
it ready for the kids,

04:32.620 --> 04:34.839
you let me know.

04:34.883 --> 04:36.450
I swing a pretty
mean hammer.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.800
Yeah, well, we'll see.

04:38.843 --> 04:40.671
I saw what you did
to the dining room table.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.282
Easy.
Mm-hmm.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.111
Thanks for the smoothie.

04:46.155 --> 04:50.028
KENSI: Three. One.

04:50.072 --> 04:52.204
Three. One. Two.

04:54.598 --> 04:57.035
One. Three. Two.

04:57.079 --> 05:00.474
DEEKS:
One. Two. Three.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.565
I'm not gonna lie,
that's some moves right there.

05:04.608 --> 05:05.740
Ow!

05:05.783 --> 05:08.395
Choreography's
a beautiful thing.

05:08.438 --> 05:10.875
Wow, you're just not
gonna let this go, are you?

05:10.919 --> 05:12.312
No, I'm not gonna
let this go.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.226
Why can't we have
a choreographer for our wedding?

05:14.270 --> 05:16.359
No, thank you.Wha-- Look, you've had
salsa class

05:16.403 --> 05:18.579
and waltz lessons; why
is this any different?

05:18.622 --> 05:19.754
Baby, this isn't
about my skills,

05:19.797 --> 05:21.190
and it certainly is not
about your skills.

05:21.233 --> 05:24.367
I just, I just want
this thing to be...Our wedding?

05:24.411 --> 05:27.370
Right, our wedding-- I want
our wedding to be natural, okay?

05:27.414 --> 05:29.459
I want it to be like us.
I don't want it to be

05:29.503 --> 05:30.852
too forced or too planned out.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.375
Because the truth
of the matter is, baby,

05:32.419 --> 05:33.724
it doesn't have to
be perfect,

05:33.768 --> 05:36.597
because we are perfect
together.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.425
And that's what this
is all about.

05:38.468 --> 05:39.643
That's all I'm saying.

05:41.428 --> 05:44.431
So...

05:44.474 --> 05:46.868
you're saying we can't do
the overhead lift,

05:46.911 --> 05:49.610
a la "I've Had The
Time of My Life"?

05:49.653 --> 05:51.351
Listen, at the end of the day,
I'm gonna do

05:51.394 --> 05:52.961
whatever it is that
you want me to do.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.789
If you want me to do
the whatever it is

05:54.832 --> 05:56.443
that you just did,
I'll do it.

05:56.486 --> 05:58.575
I'm just trying to tell you
where I'm coming from.

05:58.619 --> 06:03.014
Fine, no overhead lift
or... jazz hands.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.365
For as long as
we both shall live.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.018
We got to go.
We got a case.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.803
Actually, you know what?

06:08.846 --> 06:10.108
If you want to do that scene

06:10.152 --> 06:11.501
where you're sitting
on the chair,

06:11.545 --> 06:13.373
and you pull the cord,
and all the water comes

06:13.416 --> 06:14.591
cascading down
on your body...

06:14.635 --> 06:16.027
Pretty sure that's
a different movie.

06:16.071 --> 06:19.074
Mm, no. I've seen the movie.
I think I would know.

06:20.118 --> 06:21.250
Mm.

06:21.293 --> 06:24.819
Hail, hail, the gang is...
partially here.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.908
Mm-hmm.Uh, Mosley will arrive...

06:26.951 --> 06:28.388
Morning.
Now.

06:28.431 --> 06:31.565
Hidoko is on her way back
from firearms training,

06:31.608 --> 06:33.784
Callen and Sam are headed
to the hospital.

06:33.828 --> 06:36.483
Allow me to explain.
You do remember

06:36.526 --> 06:38.572
Claudia Diaz,
Alfonso Marca's

06:38.615 --> 06:41.052
Peruvian counterfeit princess?

06:41.096 --> 06:42.576
Of course. We locked her up
in federal prison.

06:42.619 --> 06:45.361
Please tell me
she didn't get early release.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.232
She did not.
She was murdered last night

06:47.276 --> 06:49.496
by another inmate
in a violent incident.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.454
ERIC: According to the
responding corrections officer,

06:51.498 --> 06:53.151
Claudia attacked
an inmate with a shiv,

06:53.195 --> 06:55.327
then another inmate
overpowered her,

06:55.371 --> 06:56.851
shanked her in the kidney.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.200
What do we know about
the other inmates?

06:58.243 --> 07:02.247
Well, we have Ariane Vilca
and Lorena Rosado.

07:02.291 --> 07:04.075
Both have connections to Peru.

07:04.119 --> 07:06.077
DEEKS: Yeah, well, Marca runs
his counterfeiting business

07:06.121 --> 07:07.601
out of Peru,
and then two women

07:07.644 --> 07:09.472
with Peruvian ties kill Claudia,

07:09.516 --> 07:12.083
who is the woman that
he raised as his daughter.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.476
This may be an
escalated prison beef,

07:13.520 --> 07:15.783
or someone attacked Claudia
to get to Marca.

07:15.826 --> 07:18.481
Or Marca took her out himself.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.570
He didn't want to risk her
talking to other inmates

07:20.614 --> 07:22.050
or law enforcement
about his business.

07:22.093 --> 07:25.096
Either way, this is our chance
to get close to Marca

07:25.140 --> 07:26.750
and shut down his operation.

07:26.794 --> 07:29.449
Right. Well, obviously, Claudia
did some damage with that shiv

07:29.492 --> 07:31.929
if it put Vilca and Rosado
in the hospital.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.148
MOSLEY:
Yes.

07:33.191 --> 07:35.106
Callen and Sam will
speak to them there.

07:35.150 --> 07:38.066
I'd like the two of you to
locate the corrections officer

07:38.109 --> 07:39.371
who responded
to the incident.

07:39.415 --> 07:40.895
Got it.
Done.

07:40.938 --> 07:42.636
Thank you.

07:51.079 --> 07:53.429
Special Agent Callen, this is
Special Agent Hanna, NCIS.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.518
We need to talk...WOMAN: Help!

07:55.562 --> 07:56.693
Somebody killed them!

07:58.042 --> 08:00.610
Sam. Stop! Federal agent!

08:08.052 --> 08:09.184
Gun! Gun!

08:20.282 --> 08:22.850
I'm going around.
I'll head him off.

08:38.387 --> 08:40.041
Sam, he dropped his weapon.

08:42.826 --> 08:45.002
Federal agent!

08:45.046 --> 08:47.527
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.442
Freeze!

09:00.670 --> 09:02.759
Gravity's a bitch.

09:15.206 --> 09:17.078
What do you got, Hidoko?

09:17.121 --> 09:19.080
We're working to I.D. the
suspect using his fingerprints

09:19.123 --> 09:20.647
and hospital
surveillance footage.

09:20.690 --> 09:23.171
Kensi and Deeks just landed at
the boatshed now to speak to

09:23.214 --> 09:24.607
one of Claudia's prison guards.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.609
So, Claudia was killed
in the prison by two women,

09:26.653 --> 09:28.219
and then those
two women are killed

09:28.263 --> 09:30.134
here in the hospital
by a pro.

09:30.178 --> 09:32.702
It's no prison beef.No, it's all tied
to Alfonso Marca.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.835
Either he orchestrated this
or he knows who did.

09:34.878 --> 09:37.664
Yeah, we need to talk to
Secret Service Agent DeChamps.

09:37.707 --> 09:39.796
She's been on Marca for
months, she knows him well.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.668
ERIC:
Uh, actually,

09:41.711 --> 09:44.235
no longer
Secret Service Agent DeChamps.

09:44.279 --> 09:46.760
Looks like she's now a fellow
NCIS special agent.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.326
NCIS?ERIC: Yeah.

09:48.370 --> 09:51.068
She recently completed
NCIS training at FLETC.

09:51.112 --> 09:53.418
She's out of the
San Diego office,

09:53.462 --> 09:54.594
and looks like
she's working on

09:54.637 --> 09:56.552
an undercover operation
in Orange County

09:56.596 --> 09:58.032
and South Los Angeles.

09:58.075 --> 09:59.816
All right, well, see if you can
get her current location

09:59.860 --> 10:01.078
without compromising
her operation.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.471
NELL:
Copy that.

10:05.692 --> 10:06.649
Officer Mitchell.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.608
It's a pleasure to meet you.

10:08.651 --> 10:09.609
Pleasure.
Kensi Blye.

10:09.652 --> 10:10.653
Detective Deeks.
Hi.

10:10.697 --> 10:11.654
KENSI: Thank you
for bringing her in.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.743
No problem.
Thanks.
Thank you.

10:13.787 --> 10:16.354
Thank you, sir.I rowed crew in college.
This place feels like home.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.661
I can practically smell
the Icy Hot and Gatorade.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.663
Ah, it's probably just Deeks.It probably is me.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.709
So, Kensi and I
interrogated Claudia

10:22.752 --> 10:23.797
several months back.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.059
Yeah, she was
pretty composed.

10:25.102 --> 10:26.190
Didn't seem like
the type of woman

10:26.234 --> 10:27.801
who would stab somebody
in the gut.

10:27.844 --> 10:28.802
The kind of woman
that would

10:28.845 --> 10:29.803
pay someone to do it, yes,

10:29.846 --> 10:31.413
but do it herself, no.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.894
She's exactly the kind
of woman that would do this.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.373
Claudia and her two attackers,

10:35.417 --> 10:36.810
all three of them
were well-trained.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.072
How could you tell?

10:38.115 --> 10:40.161
I was posted just outside
the day room.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.163
I heard commotion
in the southeast corner.

10:42.206 --> 10:43.817
Claudia was near Rosado
when she was

10:43.860 --> 10:45.122
tackled by Vilca.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.602
They all knew how
to handle themselves.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.039
It took me nine seconds
to arrive.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.824
In that time, Vilca
stabbed Claudia in the kidney

10:50.867 --> 10:52.652
with her own shiv.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.741
Nine seconds seems pretty exact.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.830
I ran the route and timed it
after the incident.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.440
Claudia was bleeding out
when I arrived.

10:58.483 --> 10:59.920
Then the lockdown alarm sounded,

10:59.963 --> 11:02.313
and emergency protocol
went into place.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.881
They don't seem like the only
ones who are well-trained.

11:04.925 --> 11:08.276
I was MP in Afghanistan
from 2011 to '13.

11:08.319 --> 11:09.930
Now I work correction
during the day,

11:09.973 --> 11:11.714
and I go to law school at night.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.760
Got my sights set
on the FBI.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.109
Well, that is very impressive,

11:15.152 --> 11:16.763
and they would be lucky
to have you.Thank you.

11:16.806 --> 11:18.547
Did you notice
any gang affiliations

11:18.590 --> 11:20.462
between Claudia
or her attackers?

11:20.505 --> 11:22.682
None.We're pulling
Claudia's visitor log up

11:22.725 --> 11:24.814
right now but as of...MITCHELL: She only had one.

11:24.858 --> 11:25.946
Last week.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.556
I escorted her to the room.

11:27.599 --> 11:29.993
Is this the guy who visited her?

11:30.037 --> 11:31.560
No, it wasn't.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.867
Security office will
have his photo and I.D.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.303
Okay.

11:35.346 --> 11:37.305
Thank you, you've been
really helpful.Mm-hmm.

11:37.348 --> 11:39.481
CALLEN: Over there
on the left, that's it.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.570
SAM:
What's she working?

11:41.613 --> 11:43.659
CALLEN: Says it's a weapons
for drugs case.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.270
Involves a Naval
munitions officer.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.969
Club is supposed to be
a front for the operation.

11:49.012 --> 11:51.972
DeChamps just went under.Hmm.

11:54.061 --> 11:56.019
This neighborhood's
changed a lot.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.630
Shops got torn down,
condos going up.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.981
L.A. is going vertical fast.

12:01.024 --> 12:03.940
How do you know this
neighborhood?

12:03.984 --> 12:05.115
Uh, what,
do you got a little...

12:05.159 --> 12:06.769
little gem of a shop
around the corner

12:06.813 --> 12:09.598
where you get your MCT oil
for half price or something?

12:09.641 --> 12:11.426
My cobbler's around here.

12:13.471 --> 12:15.952
Your cobbler?

12:18.389 --> 12:21.784
Layers of an onion, Sam Hanna,
layers of an onion.

12:21.828 --> 12:22.959
Been going to him for years.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.744
Every man should have a cobbler.

12:24.787 --> 12:27.790
I know I shouldn't do this,
but I'm gonna do it anyways.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.966
Why do I need a cobbler?

12:30.010 --> 12:33.056
To resole your shoes.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.884
Oh, that's interesting,
because I always took it

12:34.928 --> 12:36.973
that if the soles
of my shoes were worn out,

12:37.017 --> 12:39.410
I should go and buy
a new pair of shoes.

12:39.454 --> 12:41.238
See, that's the problem.

12:41.282 --> 12:43.937
Perfectly good pair of shoes get
sent to the dump,

12:43.980 --> 12:45.329
a new pair needs to get made.

12:45.373 --> 12:46.548
Uh-huh.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.332
Takes a toll on the planet.

12:48.376 --> 12:50.944
Besides, a cobbler
is a tradesman.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.206
They're experts
in their craft...

12:52.249 --> 12:53.424
And there it is.

12:54.904 --> 12:55.992
What?

12:56.036 --> 12:57.951
You are enamored with anyone

12:57.994 --> 12:59.866
who has mastered
a craft or a trade.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.302
I mean, t-this cobbler

13:01.345 --> 13:03.347
is just one in a long line

13:03.391 --> 13:07.699
behind your-your custom knife
guy, your boxing instructor,

13:07.743 --> 13:10.485
the woman in Hawaii
who makes your spearguns,

13:10.528 --> 13:12.443
your jiu-jitsu instructor--
am I missing anyone?

13:12.487 --> 13:13.618
My wetsuit tailor.

13:13.662 --> 13:14.402
Your wetsuit tailor.

13:14.445 --> 13:15.882
Is that even a real thing?

13:15.925 --> 13:17.840
Do I look like a guy that
can just walk into a store

13:17.884 --> 13:19.537
and buy a wetsuit
off the rack?

13:19.581 --> 13:22.149
Please.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.803
All right, just like
you like it.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.849
Double vanilla nonfat latte

13:26.893 --> 13:29.199
with two sugars,
one dash of cream.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.940
Wow, really?

13:30.984 --> 13:32.550
No, it's essentially
dirty bath water.

13:32.594 --> 13:33.987
Enjoy it.Oh, okay, thank you.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.205
NELL: Hey, guys.Hey.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.859
So we just got
the photo and I.D.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.643
of Claudia's mystery visitor.

13:38.687 --> 13:41.646
Yeah, he signed in
under the alias "Son Goku,"

13:41.690 --> 13:44.562
:
which, if you liked anime,

13:44.606 --> 13:46.303
would be hilarious,
because that guy's like...

13:46.347 --> 13:47.609
Eric, Eric.ERIC:

13:47.652 --> 13:48.871
Needless to say,

13:48.915 --> 13:50.481
it was a fake name.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.396
Anyway, we were able
to match his photo

13:52.440 --> 13:55.051
to a customs photo
of Oscar Mori.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.487
He's a Peruvian businessman

13:56.531 --> 13:58.838
who flew into Seattle
just days before the visit.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.536
NELL: And Amtrak records show
that Mori took

14:01.579 --> 14:03.494
the train down the
coast and arrived

14:03.538 --> 14:05.061
in L.A. a couple
days later.

14:05.105 --> 14:06.889
Check this out.
I ran Mori through

14:06.933 --> 14:09.457
the Peruvian National
Police database.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.025
The Peruvian authorities
have Marca's Lima compound

14:12.068 --> 14:13.635
under surveillance.

14:13.678 --> 14:16.203
Mori was photographed exiting
the compound two weeks ago.

14:16.246 --> 14:18.727
And he came to visit Claudia not
long after that photo was taken,

14:18.770 --> 14:20.511
and then she was
killed a few days later.

14:20.555 --> 14:22.339
Maybe he thought Marca
was gonna come after her,

14:22.383 --> 14:23.819
so he went to warn her.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.953
Or maybe Mori brought Claudia
a message from Marca.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.650
And whatever
was in that message caused her

14:28.693 --> 14:30.957
to go on the offensive,
and make that shiv.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.874
Well, you may be able
to ask Mori

14:34.917 --> 14:36.876
what he told Claudia yourself.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.616
Looks like he just used
his credit card

14:38.660 --> 14:40.488
to pay for parking in Malibu.

14:40.531 --> 14:42.620
On it. Driving.

14:48.670 --> 14:49.932
CALLEN:
Here we go.

14:52.195 --> 14:54.589
SAM:
When these two clear,

14:54.632 --> 14:57.157
we'll follow her someplace
where we can talk.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.290
Maybe we can go
to your cobbler's place.

15:00.334 --> 15:02.902
She might need new soles
for her boots, you know?

15:02.945 --> 15:04.512
Kill two birds.

15:04.555 --> 15:07.645
You know, that's some
good material.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.212
Thank you.

15:09.256 --> 15:11.432
Yeah, maybe you should put
together a set, hit an open mic.

15:11.475 --> 15:12.824
Yeah, that's actually
something to think about.

15:12.868 --> 15:15.001
I may actually
meditate on it.

15:21.181 --> 15:22.878
She saw us.

15:25.576 --> 15:26.882
Shooters.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.068
Long guns!

15:49.165 --> 15:50.906
DeCHAMPS:
I don't have a gun!

16:10.534 --> 16:11.883
I'm moving to DeChamps.

16:11.927 --> 16:13.885
I got you. Go!

16:30.119 --> 16:31.947
Loaded, ready to go.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.124
I'm pinned down over here!

16:35.168 --> 16:36.908
Yeah, so are we.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.649
We can't play this game
much longer.

16:38.693 --> 16:40.782
I can't get a good shot;
I need a better angle.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.218
Go, I got you.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.923
I still don't have a clean shot.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.173
Come in.

17:24.217 --> 17:29.048
You've heard that Callen, Sam
and DeChamps are safe?

17:29.091 --> 17:30.440
Yes.

17:30.484 --> 17:32.399
And thank goodness
for that.

17:32.442 --> 17:35.097
My Secret Service
counterparts are trying

17:35.141 --> 17:38.318
to talk me out
of our continued involvement

17:38.361 --> 17:40.102
in the Marca case.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.104
But you are holding your ground.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.367
Of course.

17:44.411 --> 17:47.153
They've implied
that I'm unnecessarily putting

17:47.196 --> 17:49.981
the team at risk.

17:50.025 --> 17:52.767
I think they want
the Marca case to themselves.

17:52.810 --> 17:54.769
Ah, well, you could be correct.

17:54.812 --> 17:57.859
They are notoriously
territorial.

17:57.902 --> 18:00.035
Callen and Sam
encountered a group

18:00.079 --> 18:03.038
of trained shooters,
who are now dead.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.954
Well, better the shooters
than our people.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.303
Of course, Hetty, but this means

18:07.347 --> 18:09.566
that we have
no additional leads.

18:09.610 --> 18:13.614
Well, a "standstill"
is just that.

18:13.657 --> 18:15.833
You stand still for a while.

18:15.877 --> 18:19.098
Take stock of the road
you're traveling.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.056
Fair enough.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.233
It appears Claudia's death
has hit Marca hard.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.583
So it makes sense that he'd
want to go after anyone

18:26.627 --> 18:29.064
who was responsible
for her incarceration.

18:29.108 --> 18:33.024
If that's the case, he's already
gone after DeChamps.

18:33.068 --> 18:37.420
Sam, Kensi and Deeks
may be next on his list.

18:37.464 --> 18:39.074
Exactly my point.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.120
Yes.

18:41.163 --> 18:44.166
So, uh, a preliminary I.D. just
came back on the shooters

18:44.210 --> 18:45.689
that went after DeChamps.

18:45.733 --> 18:48.953
It turns out, they do have ties
to Marca's team in Lima.

18:48.997 --> 18:51.956
Additionally, Kensi and Deeks
located Oscar Mori,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.045
the man who visited Claudia
in prison,

18:54.089 --> 18:55.090
and they are
surveilling him now.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.222
Thank you.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.965
Well.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.753
We stand still no longer.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.067
I got Oscar Mori,

19:16.111 --> 19:18.896
and two creatine freaks

19:18.940 --> 19:21.072
I can only assume
are bodyguards.

19:21.116 --> 19:22.683
Maybe this Mori
guy didn't fly

19:22.726 --> 19:24.772
all the way from Peru to
do something for Marca.

19:24.815 --> 19:27.122
Maybe he just wanted the
best clam chowder in Malibu.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.342
Maybe.

19:29.385 --> 19:32.214
I have the most amazing idea.

19:32.258 --> 19:35.086
Does it involve vacation time
and Diamond Head?

19:35.130 --> 19:36.958
What about here?

19:37.001 --> 19:38.438
What do you mean "here"?

19:38.481 --> 19:39.613
We've been talking about
surfing in Hawaii for months.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.397
What about if we did
the wedding here?

19:41.441 --> 19:43.530
In Malibu,
on the beach.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.009
Baby, we talk about doing
a beach wedding.

19:45.053 --> 19:46.446
Why not do it here,
on our beach?

19:46.489 --> 19:47.577
Why fly
to somebody else's beach?

19:47.621 --> 19:48.665
That's their beach.

19:48.709 --> 19:50.058
You're right.

19:50.101 --> 19:52.060
I'm

19:52.103 --> 19:54.018
I could just-- if I could
just record that, maybe,

19:54.062 --> 19:55.455
and use it as my outgoing
voice message,

19:55.498 --> 19:57.674
just to let everyone know
how right I am.

19:57.718 --> 19:59.720
I'm just saying that
it is a beautiful location,

19:59.763 --> 20:02.157
and that patio is huge--
it could fit, like, what, 150?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.941
Oh. No, no.
Easily.

20:03.985 --> 20:06.074
Not-not so much
the restaurant.

20:06.117 --> 20:08.903
I was talking about the beach,
and 150 people?

20:08.946 --> 20:11.253
: Okay,
that's way too many people.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.776
I was thinking, like,
ten people.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.778
Just the people that mean
the most to us, by our side.

20:14.822 --> 20:17.433
There are way more than ten
people that mean the most to me.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.348
Right. No, no, no.
Obviously, more than ten.

20:19.392 --> 20:20.480
Like, fif-fifteen,

20:20.523 --> 20:21.698
twenty?

20:21.742 --> 20:23.352
Deeks, I grew up on bases.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.485
I was the agent afloat
for an aircraft carrier.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.138
The people that mean
the most to me add up.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.792
It's not just the people that
mean the most to me right now.

20:28.836 --> 20:30.881
And, for you, that makes sense,
and that's totally right.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.796
It's just, for me, I'm a little
bit different, you know?

20:32.840 --> 20:35.669
When I move on, for better
or for worse, I move on.

20:35.712 --> 20:37.497
It's not like I'm keeping track
of, like, my buddies

20:37.540 --> 20:39.238
that I played Little League
baseball with.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.501
Little League?Not that-- and, but
with you, it's different.

20:41.544 --> 20:43.111
And these people love you,
and you love them,

20:43.154 --> 20:44.547
and they should be
at your wedding.

20:44.591 --> 20:45.679
:
Our wedding.

20:45.722 --> 20:46.767
Our wedding.

20:46.810 --> 20:47.333
I love you.

20:47.376 --> 20:48.421
I love you, too.

20:48.464 --> 20:49.900
But just to clarify,

20:49.944 --> 20:51.859
that means you're okay
with the reception being here?

20:51.902 --> 20:53.817
Yeah, I'm sure they could do
a wonderful fixed menu

20:53.861 --> 20:56.080
of clam chowder
and fish and chips.

20:56.124 --> 20:57.647
Okay, it sounds
like you're being sarcastic,

20:57.691 --> 20:59.649
but I'm serious, like,
that's my kind of party.

20:59.693 --> 21:01.172
Our kind of party!Our kind of party.

21:01.216 --> 21:03.087
Oh, my gosh.

21:03.131 --> 21:04.393
Gonna be so much fun.

21:04.437 --> 21:06.439
I know.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.878
KENSI: Looks like our boy
just ordered two more beers.

21:10.921 --> 21:12.575
I'm guessing they're here
for the long haul.

21:12.619 --> 21:15.274
He's surrounded by civilians
and his bodyguards.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.840
We need to get him alone.

21:16.884 --> 21:18.755
I have a plan.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.757
You have so many plans.

21:20.801 --> 21:21.671
I do.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.586
What could possibly go wrong?

21:23.630 --> 21:25.806
If this is tied to the
original Marca undercover op,

21:25.849 --> 21:27.547
we need to talk to
his man in L.A.

21:27.590 --> 21:28.678
That suit from the yacht.

21:28.722 --> 21:30.201
Michael Silva.

21:30.245 --> 21:31.986
Yeah, he was vetting all of
Marca's deals in America.

21:32.029 --> 21:33.770
This guy can
give us insight into Marca

21:33.814 --> 21:35.163
better than anyone in L.A.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.338
Well, he's been on
the Secret Service's watch list

21:36.382 --> 21:37.818
for a long time.

21:37.861 --> 21:39.602
Well, there might be something
in his file we can use.

21:39.646 --> 21:41.169
I'll call and have them
sent up to Ops.

21:41.212 --> 21:43.084
All right.HETTY: That's a good idea.

21:43.127 --> 21:44.303
I'll get Eric on that.

21:44.346 --> 21:46.130
Agent DeChamps,

21:46.174 --> 21:47.567
Henrietta Lange.

21:47.610 --> 21:48.568
It is an honor to meet you.

21:48.611 --> 21:50.047
Oh.

21:50.091 --> 21:52.615
Well, I'm sorry to cut
our introduction short,

21:52.659 --> 21:55.618
but I'm afraid you and Sam
need to carry on

21:55.662 --> 21:58.360
with the investigation
yourselves.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.884
I need to talk to Mr. Callen.

22:00.928 --> 22:03.104
Hetty, we're-we're right in
the middle of this. I can't...

22:03.147 --> 22:05.672
I realize that,
but I think you two

22:05.715 --> 22:07.761
go off and find Silva.

22:12.809 --> 22:14.158
What's going on?

22:14.202 --> 22:18.815
The, uh, day that we knew
would come has arrived.

22:18.859 --> 22:21.078
The ATF
Internal Affairs

22:21.122 --> 22:24.691
board has an opening
this evening in their schedule.

22:24.734 --> 22:28.085
They want to interview me about
Anna and the Sokolov shooting.

22:28.129 --> 22:29.522
Yes.

22:31.132 --> 22:34.178
I suggest you head for Glendale,

22:34.222 --> 22:37.094
stop in and see Anna.

22:37.138 --> 22:41.664
See where her head is at,
and yours.

22:51.979 --> 22:54.111
MAN:
Oh, delicious.

22:54.155 --> 22:57.811
Excuse me. Um, which one of you
gentleman had the prawn special?

22:57.854 --> 22:59.334
I did.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.510
This is super uncomfortable

23:01.554 --> 23:03.382
and I'm not sure
how to tell you this.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.384
Out with it. What's happening?

23:05.427 --> 23:07.821
Our supplier just called
and the prawns we received

23:07.864 --> 23:08.822
have...

23:08.865 --> 23:10.606
: parasites.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.608
Parasites?Large ones.

23:12.652 --> 23:16.133
What
This is not funny.

23:16.177 --> 23:18.875
No, it's not. They're really big
and pretty slimy.

23:18.919 --> 23:20.137
They're actually really...Enough.

23:20.181 --> 23:22.444
Enough. What should I do?

23:22.488 --> 23:26.448
Um... you should probably, um...

23:26.492 --> 23:27.928
get them out
as soon as possible.

23:27.971 --> 23:29.799
The closest restroom is
right around the corner.

23:29.843 --> 23:31.845
No. Stay here.

23:31.888 --> 23:35.239
I... have to do this alone.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.376
Yeah.
You need to get
out of my way right now.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.900
I got to go to the bathroom.
I got parasites in me.

23:43.944 --> 23:45.946
They're-they're big and slimy.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.521
Wait, so you're saying
I

23:55.564 --> 23:57.958
I mean, you may, just not
from this restaurant.

24:00.003 --> 24:01.396
Who are you?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.093
We are NCIS.

24:03.137 --> 24:05.400
We know that you're Oscar Mori
and that you have close ties

24:05.444 --> 24:07.315
with Alfonso Marca
and Claudia Diaz.

24:07.358 --> 24:09.535
If you say so.

24:09.578 --> 24:11.058
Why did you go and
visit Claudia at the prison

24:11.101 --> 24:12.276
three days before
she was killed?

24:12.320 --> 24:14.104
Claudia's dead?

24:14.148 --> 24:16.106
Thanks to two
of her fellow inmates who,

24:16.150 --> 24:18.065
coincidentally,
were also murdered.

24:21.808 --> 24:23.897
Okay, look,

24:23.940 --> 24:27.204
I was doing some deals
with Marca in Lima

24:27.248 --> 24:29.511
and we-we-we had a falling out.

24:29.555 --> 24:32.166
Well, that is someone you do not
want to have a falling out with.

24:32.209 --> 24:35.778
Yeah, I know, right?
So I owed him.

24:35.822 --> 24:38.389
Which means I have to do
what he says

24:38.433 --> 24:41.523
or he's gonna kill me,
so I had to come here

24:41.567 --> 24:43.699
and give Claudia a message.What was the message?

24:44.787 --> 24:47.050
You know, how come I don't
just get up and leave?

24:47.094 --> 24:49.531
What-what responsibility
do I have to help you guys?

24:49.575 --> 24:50.967
You're right.
He totally doesn't,

24:51.011 --> 24:52.534
except for the fact
that, you know what,

24:52.578 --> 24:55.711
our partner has photos of you
meeting with us in private,

24:55.755 --> 24:58.235
which I'm sure Senor Marca
would love to see.

24:58.279 --> 25:01.587
Come on, man, no.
This sucks!

25:01.630 --> 25:02.849
Not as much as parasites.

25:02.892 --> 25:05.068
Yeah, 'cause those
are big and slimy.

25:08.594 --> 25:12.815
Una súpernova
te hizo una pregunta.

25:12.859 --> 25:15.165
A supernova
asked you a question.

25:15.209 --> 25:16.993
What the hell does that mean?

25:17.037 --> 25:19.126
That was the coded message
for Claudia.

25:19.169 --> 25:21.607
What else did he
tell you to do?Nothing.

25:21.650 --> 25:22.782
You sure about that?

25:22.825 --> 25:25.959
Okay, okay.

25:26.002 --> 25:27.917
I had to buy some resin

25:27.961 --> 25:30.311
and I brought it to
this garage in Van Nuys.

25:30.354 --> 25:33.096
That's it, I swear.
Now I really feel sick.

25:33.140 --> 25:35.098
Oh, maybe you do have parasites.

25:35.142 --> 25:37.231
I'm gonna go.
No.
Just...

25:37.274 --> 25:38.841
You can stay here
and observe that view

25:38.885 --> 25:40.669
for a little longer
while LAPD gets here.

25:40.713 --> 25:42.802
I thought we had a deal.Oh, yeah, no, we have
a deal. We're good.

25:42.845 --> 25:44.630
Except for, LAPD, they...Yeah, no.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.545
They know about the Escalades
that you moved

25:46.588 --> 25:47.720
last time you were here.

25:47.763 --> 25:51.506
Eek. Oh, no! No, no.

25:53.943 --> 25:54.901
Hey.

25:54.944 --> 25:56.859
Hey.

25:59.079 --> 26:01.777
Did the UPS guy
bring my spirulina?

26:01.821 --> 26:06.216
Spirulina
A type of pasta or something?

26:06.260 --> 26:09.872
Algae supplements.
Helps endurance.

26:09.916 --> 26:12.309
What a coincidence,
so does pasta.

26:12.353 --> 26:13.789
Hmm.

26:15.269 --> 26:16.618
Can we talk?

26:16.662 --> 26:19.534
About my workout and nutrition?

26:19.578 --> 26:21.580
No.

26:21.623 --> 26:25.018
I thought I'd hear
from you more often.

26:25.061 --> 26:28.804
I mean, I know I moved, but
you do own a car and a phone.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.023
I know.

26:30.066 --> 26:31.981
And I have been
worried about you.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.767
I... I wasn't sure if you
wanted some time alone.

26:34.810 --> 26:38.161
I should've called.

26:38.205 --> 26:39.902
Or stopped by.

26:39.946 --> 26:42.731
Yeah.

26:42.775 --> 26:46.866
So are you here to see me?

26:46.909 --> 26:49.259
Or are you here to make
yourself feel better

26:49.303 --> 26:51.044
about the conversation
you're about to have

26:51.087 --> 26:52.959
with my colleagues at ATF?

26:53.002 --> 26:56.615
If I could make this
go away, I would.

26:58.007 --> 27:02.098
I don't need you to be
my hero or my protector.

27:02.142 --> 27:04.318
I need you to understand
that what I'm going through

27:04.361 --> 27:06.189
has nothing to do with you

27:06.233 --> 27:07.974
and this isn't about
how this makes you feel

27:08.017 --> 27:10.411
because I'm going
through this, not you.

27:15.503 --> 27:16.765
You're right.

27:16.809 --> 27:20.682
I'm... I'm sorry.

27:20.726 --> 27:23.729
It came out a lot harsher
than I meant it to.

27:23.772 --> 27:25.818
I get it.

27:25.861 --> 27:29.604
I mean, your job and your-your
future are at stake here, so...

27:33.869 --> 27:35.654
Do you want to take a walk?

27:37.743 --> 27:39.222
Sure.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.007
Okay.

27:46.534 --> 27:48.405
[indistinct announcement
over P.A.]

27:52.496 --> 27:54.716
Hello, Michael.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.587
Do you know why we're here?

27:56.631 --> 28:00.069
If you have something
to offer me, offer it.

28:00.113 --> 28:01.723
If not, leave.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.334
Claudia Diaz was murdered
in prison today.

28:10.993 --> 28:13.735
My younger brother has
a severe learning disability.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.650
Mm.

28:15.694 --> 28:19.001
He struggled his entire life
with bullies.

28:19.045 --> 28:22.788
High school was impossibly
difficult for him.

28:22.831 --> 28:24.790
He never recovered.

28:24.833 --> 28:27.880
Does this story sound
familiar at all to you?

28:27.923 --> 28:32.101
Sit down.
Did you know
about my brother?

28:32.145 --> 28:34.321
Is that why you pushed
that persona that you did?

28:34.364 --> 28:35.496
Michael.

28:35.539 --> 28:37.324
That is so low.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.773
After I met you
in the condo,

28:51.817 --> 28:54.950
I studied you.

28:54.994 --> 28:57.387
I knew all about
your little brother,

28:57.431 --> 29:00.521
played into it.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.784
This the next
level, Michael.

29:02.828 --> 29:05.178
You feel me?

29:15.623 --> 29:18.365
Silva hasn't given
anything up on Marca.

29:18.408 --> 29:20.584
Pull up the rest of the
surveillance photos in Lima

29:20.628 --> 29:22.761
outside Marca's residence
and run them.

29:22.804 --> 29:23.762
I am on it.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.067
I want to know if anyone else

29:25.111 --> 29:26.590
who visited Marca
has ties to L.A.

29:26.634 --> 29:29.593
It turns out that Mori
was telling the truth

29:29.637 --> 29:31.770
to Kensi and Deeks back
at the restaurant.

29:31.813 --> 29:35.164
He dropped off what looks like
200 pounds of resin

29:35.208 --> 29:37.906
to a garage in
Van Nuys two days ago.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.778
Five hours later, a van
picked up the buckets.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.344
I'm tracking it now.

29:41.388 --> 29:45.784
Powdered resin is brushed
onto metal printing plates

29:45.827 --> 29:47.829
in a technique
called "intaglio,"

29:47.873 --> 29:50.571
which is used to
print Japanese yen.

29:50.614 --> 29:54.357
Marca only counterfeited
U.S. bills and euros.

29:54.401 --> 29:57.143
I mean, he doesn't have any
history of printing fake yen.

29:57.186 --> 29:58.535
Is this a new business venture?

29:58.579 --> 30:00.711
I mean, it makes sense.

30:00.755 --> 30:03.540
Peru has a large
Japanese population.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.151
Maybe Marca thought fake yen
would be something

30:05.194 --> 30:06.500
he could easily offload.

30:06.543 --> 30:08.981
Yen are notoriously
difficult to counterfeit,

30:09.024 --> 30:11.592
but if anyone could pull
this off, it would be Marca.

30:11.635 --> 30:13.507
Hey, I picked up the van

30:13.550 --> 30:15.291
carrying the resin
in Topanga Canyon.

30:15.335 --> 30:17.380
Where's it headed?

30:17.424 --> 30:19.426
It passed through the
intersection of Paseo Miramar

30:19.469 --> 30:22.298
and Topanga Fire Road,
but I lost it there.

30:22.342 --> 30:25.040
Okay, so that road
leads to three ranches.

30:25.084 --> 30:26.868
The van must've
went to one of them.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.652
There are no cameras
in that whole area.

30:28.696 --> 30:31.873
Tell Kensi and Deeks they need
to get a visual on the area,

30:31.917 --> 30:33.744
and they need
to do it quickly.

30:33.788 --> 30:34.833
Mm-hmm.On it.

30:37.836 --> 30:41.535
Maybe we can speed this along.
I got SportsCenterat 2:00.

30:41.578 --> 30:42.841
What are you authorized
to give me?

30:42.884 --> 30:44.407
Another year or two
on your sentence

30:44.451 --> 30:45.756
for attacking two
federal agents.

30:45.800 --> 30:46.627
That work for you?

30:46.670 --> 30:47.976
It wasn't personal.

30:48.020 --> 30:49.673
Oh, sure it was.

30:49.717 --> 30:52.763
I knew word would get out
that I met with you.

30:52.807 --> 30:56.680
These bruises on my face,
they back up my story.

30:56.724 --> 30:58.117
I didn't tell you anything.

30:58.160 --> 31:01.424
Claudia's dead.

31:01.468 --> 31:03.818
Marca wants revenge.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.515
We think he killed the women
who attacked Claudia,

31:05.559 --> 31:07.778
then came after me because
I helped put her in jail.

31:07.822 --> 31:10.694
Sounds like you two
have it all figured out.

31:10.738 --> 31:12.305
Am I free to go?

31:12.348 --> 31:16.004
Not afraid that Marca's
gonna take you out next?

31:16.048 --> 31:19.138
Why would he do that?
I've been nothing but loyal.

31:19.181 --> 31:21.096
Nothing but loyal?

31:21.140 --> 31:24.795
Claudia was here in L.A.
to evaluate you.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.232
Marca didn't trust you.

31:26.275 --> 31:29.148
When we confiscated
Claudia's laptop,

31:29.191 --> 31:32.455
we got the
whole picture.

31:32.499 --> 31:35.328
She knew you were
skimming off his profits.

31:36.633 --> 31:38.897
Marca is going to kill you.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.550
How's solitary sound now?

31:44.990 --> 31:46.600
All right, we're here.

31:46.643 --> 31:47.993
We're gonna go
to higher ground,

31:48.036 --> 31:49.690
see if we can get a better
view of the three ranches.

31:49.733 --> 31:51.561
ERIC:
I was able to secure use

31:51.605 --> 31:52.998
of a Forest Service satellite,

31:53.041 --> 31:54.782
so we'll be your eyes
as you move higher.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.827
Copy that.
Moving.

32:00.266 --> 32:01.571
ANNA:
That statue up there?

32:01.615 --> 32:03.660
CALLEN: Anna...There was this actor
in the '20s.

32:03.704 --> 32:06.315
His fans loved him so much
that they paid

32:06.359 --> 32:09.231
for that statue to be built.Hey. Hey.

32:11.451 --> 32:13.714
I may not be able
to help you through this,

32:13.757 --> 32:16.847
but I can at least try
to not make it worse for you.

32:16.891 --> 32:19.981
I know.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.201
I'm not the best
at letting people in.

32:22.244 --> 32:24.943
Look who you're
talking to.

32:28.642 --> 32:31.471
My best friend, Katia,

32:31.514 --> 32:35.040
she lived down the street
from me in Moscow.

32:35.083 --> 32:39.131
Since she was six, she
wanted to be a ballerina.

32:39.174 --> 32:41.002
That's all she wanted.

32:41.046 --> 32:42.612
And she did it.

32:42.656 --> 32:45.311
Years of hard work,

32:45.354 --> 32:48.314
but she made it
into the Bolshoi.

32:48.357 --> 32:50.490
One day in rehearsal,
she leaped, and...

32:50.533 --> 32:54.059
it was the same leap she'd done
a thousand times before,

32:54.102 --> 32:58.715
but this time, she tore
her quad muscle from her bone.

32:58.759 --> 33:02.502
She never recovered,
never was the same.

33:04.591 --> 33:06.245
What is Katia doing now?

33:08.464 --> 33:10.466
She drank herself to death.

33:10.510 --> 33:12.860
I'm sorry.

33:12.903 --> 33:15.297
Um, the thing is,

33:15.341 --> 33:17.865
when it happened,

33:17.908 --> 33:20.433
I completely
understood her.

33:20.476 --> 33:22.522
Ballet was her life.

33:22.565 --> 33:25.525
She had no plan B.

33:25.568 --> 33:28.354
It was her dream,
her passion.

33:28.397 --> 33:31.052
And it was taken
away from her.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.359
You are not her.

33:33.402 --> 33:36.579
This job is my dream.

33:36.623 --> 33:40.105
But my story will
end differently.

33:40.148 --> 33:43.064
The outcome of
this investigation

33:43.108 --> 33:44.587
will not define me.

33:44.631 --> 33:47.503
It will not break me.

33:47.547 --> 33:48.983
Anna, listen to me.
I can tell...

33:49.027 --> 33:51.899
You tell them the truth.

33:51.942 --> 33:53.727
You weren't there
when I shot Sokolov.

33:53.770 --> 33:55.337
Anna...

33:55.381 --> 33:57.557
You didn't see anything.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.255
He was already dead when you
came through that door,

34:00.299 --> 34:04.172
and I was holding my gun.

34:04.216 --> 34:05.391
That's all you saw.

34:05.434 --> 34:09.656
And that's the truth.

34:09.699 --> 34:10.787
Anna...

34:10.831 --> 34:13.790
Bye, Callen.

34:31.286 --> 34:32.505
ERIC:
All right, we have visuals

34:32.548 --> 34:34.072
of the three properties
in the area,

34:34.115 --> 34:35.421
but the only one
with vehicles present

34:35.464 --> 34:37.553
is directly to your southeast.

34:37.597 --> 34:39.903
No confirmation
that the resin truck is there,

34:39.947 --> 34:42.297
but we are picking up
heat signatures

34:42.341 --> 34:45.126
of what appear to be
recently driven cars

34:45.170 --> 34:46.562
parked under the carport.

34:46.606 --> 34:48.173
Copy that, Nell.
Thanks.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.394
Claudia knew you were skimming
money from Marca and told him.

34:52.438 --> 34:54.570
Sounds like a motive to me.

34:54.614 --> 34:56.616
I had nothing to do
with her murder.

34:56.659 --> 34:58.618
Give us something.

34:58.661 --> 35:01.055
We think we found one of Marca's
production facilities.

35:04.667 --> 35:08.410
I'll tell you what I know,
if you do something for me.

35:08.454 --> 35:11.196
You want a transfer
or you want solitary?

35:11.239 --> 35:15.504
Nothing for me.
It's for my brother.

35:15.548 --> 35:17.637
What about him?

35:17.680 --> 35:21.293
Andrew's always wanted
to live alone.

35:22.903 --> 35:24.557
He's incredible.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.646
He lives in a group home
in Santa Monica--

35:26.689 --> 35:28.256
a place for adults
with disabilities.

35:28.300 --> 35:32.260
He's got a job at
a burger joint on Venice.

35:32.304 --> 35:35.959
That's all he's ever wanted,
make his own money.

35:36.003 --> 35:39.180
He's so... proud.

35:39.224 --> 35:40.616
He should be.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.185
He just told me that the guy
who runs this group home

35:44.229 --> 35:46.100
is taxing him.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.363
Every night, this dude takes
most of the money

35:48.407 --> 35:50.104
that Andrew earns.

35:50.148 --> 35:53.455
He's scared to say anything
because...I'll take care of it.

35:53.499 --> 35:56.328
I'll do it myself.

36:02.638 --> 36:04.727
You didn't find one of Marca's
production facilities.

36:04.771 --> 36:07.861
He pulled all of his
counterfeit production

36:07.904 --> 36:09.254
out of California
after your team

36:09.297 --> 36:10.690
took out his
downtown facility.

36:10.733 --> 36:12.822
The place is isolated.

36:12.866 --> 36:15.173
They had supplies for
making counterfeit bills.

36:15.216 --> 36:16.913
We think...Isolated?

36:16.957 --> 36:18.698
Like a ranch?Yeah.

36:18.741 --> 36:20.874
Out past Topanga?

36:20.917 --> 36:22.658
Sometimes supplies are stored
there before shipping out,

36:22.702 --> 36:24.617
but that's not
what the ranch is for.

36:24.660 --> 36:27.097
Marca travels
with a tactical team.

36:27.141 --> 36:28.447
They're highly trained.

36:28.490 --> 36:30.666
When they're here,
they work out of that ranch.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.973
If you have people
going in there,

36:33.016 --> 36:35.149
they better bring
a lot of firepower.

36:36.759 --> 36:37.978
SAM:
Nell...

36:38.021 --> 36:39.501
where's Kensi and Deeks?

36:39.545 --> 36:41.024
We're tracking them now, Sam.

36:41.068 --> 36:42.243
They're surveilling
one of the ranches.

36:42.287 --> 36:44.245
ERIC: Let me get out
of heat signature mode.

36:44.289 --> 36:45.377
Shooters.

36:45.420 --> 36:47.901
Shooters moving in
directly behind you.

36:47.944 --> 36:49.729
Kensi, Deeks, do you copy?

36:59.304 --> 37:01.044
DEEKS:
Go, Kens, go!

37:08.356 --> 37:09.575
We're gonna have to move.

37:09.618 --> 37:11.272
That is way too steep
for cover and move.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.318
If by steep,
you mean a sheer cliff.

37:18.975 --> 37:22.240
This rock is not gonna
be my Alamo.

37:22.283 --> 37:23.371
Really?
So you want to do this?

37:23.415 --> 37:24.938
No, I don't want to do this.

37:24.981 --> 37:26.548
But I don't want to
get shot in the head more.

37:28.463 --> 37:29.725
On three?

37:29.769 --> 37:31.292
Uh, let's make it two.

37:31.336 --> 37:32.946
One...Hold on, hold on.

37:32.989 --> 37:34.077
Let's make it four.
Let's go on four.

37:34.121 --> 37:35.601
Two... three.Three...

37:35.644 --> 37:36.776
Four!
Four!

37:57.927 --> 38:00.495
Kens... Kens, you okay?

38:00.539 --> 38:02.323
Yeah. You okay?

38:06.327 --> 38:09.504
Well... I think we
bought ourselves some time.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.420
Son of a bitch.

38:12.464 --> 38:13.334
Go, go, go, go...

38:14.814 --> 38:18.644
Ow. Okay.

38:18.687 --> 38:21.211
KENSI: Eric and Nell,

38:21.255 --> 38:22.300
we found cover.
Where are they?

38:22.343 --> 38:23.736
ERIC:
I still have five shooters.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.346
None of them followed you
straight down the hill.

38:25.390 --> 38:26.913
They took a path
to the south of you,

38:26.956 --> 38:28.436
so you did buy yourself
some time.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.003
Look at that.
Told ya, huh?

38:30.046 --> 38:32.527
NELL: Now, there is
a stable up ahead.

38:32.571 --> 38:34.355
It's about a mile
from your current position.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.966
It looks sturdy.
Callen, Sam and DeChamps

38:37.010 --> 38:38.446
are inbound.Okay, if we can

38:38.490 --> 38:40.318
make it to that stable,
we might stand a chance.

38:40.361 --> 38:42.581
Yeah, that sounds like
a more suitable Alamo
than that stupid rock.

38:42.624 --> 38:44.452
You do know how
the Alamo ended, right?

38:44.496 --> 38:46.367
I sure do, Sundance.

38:46.411 --> 38:48.369
Butch and Sundance
were not at the Alamo.

38:48.413 --> 38:49.979
I mean, I've seen the movie,
I think I know.

38:50.023 --> 38:52.504
Okay, you definitely
have a concussion.

38:55.028 --> 38:56.856
Kensi and Deeks just
landed at the stable.

38:56.899 --> 38:58.379
Five shooters are closing.

38:58.423 --> 38:59.859
The shooters will
keep their distance.

38:59.902 --> 39:01.817
Stay behind cover,
then light up the stables.

39:01.861 --> 39:05.168
We come in from the east fast,
they won't know what hit 'em.

39:05.212 --> 39:06.779
Let's do it.

39:15.744 --> 39:17.572
DEEKS:
Go, go, go, go, go.

39:19.444 --> 39:21.837
I got about one and a half
mags left.

39:21.881 --> 39:23.404
Well, you beat me
by a half a mag.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.580
There's five shooters.Eh, that seems fair.

39:25.624 --> 39:29.497

Nice work.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.475
Assistant Director.

40:34.519 --> 40:36.346
Shay Mosley.
We trained together

40:36.390 --> 40:37.609
in Glynco a few
years back.

40:37.652 --> 40:39.959
Yeah, I remember you.

40:40.002 --> 40:43.484
Congratulations on your move
from Secret Service to NCIS.

40:43.528 --> 40:44.442
It's a good choice.

40:44.485 --> 40:46.966
KENSI:
Hey.

40:47.009 --> 40:48.446
MOSLEY: Search of the ranch
reveal anything?

40:48.489 --> 40:50.360
Just the buckets
of resin.

40:50.404 --> 40:52.493
No other equipment used in the
production of counterfeit bills.

40:52.537 --> 40:54.495
And Marca must have got word
that we talked to Mori.

40:54.539 --> 40:55.627
He knew about
the resin delivery,

40:55.670 --> 40:56.889
so we showed up at that ranch,

40:56.932 --> 40:58.499
and those guys were
waiting to ambush us.

40:58.543 --> 41:01.328
I just got a prelim I.D. on
the shooter from the hospital.

41:01.371 --> 41:03.461
His name is Ricardo Ferrera.

41:03.504 --> 41:05.767
He's a head security officer
for the Cordobas.

41:05.811 --> 41:07.377
The Cordoba family's
been trying for years

41:07.421 --> 41:09.336
to move in on Marca's
Peru operations.

41:09.379 --> 41:11.077
Well, and they figured after
they took out Claudia,

41:11.120 --> 41:12.382
he would start
a war in America

41:12.426 --> 41:13.862
and take his eye off
the ball in Peru.

41:13.906 --> 41:15.995
Well, there's no way Marca's
gonna let the Cordobas out

41:16.038 --> 41:18.040
of his sight once he realizes
what they've done.

41:18.084 --> 41:20.521
And I'm not gonna
let Marca out of mine.

41:24.786 --> 41:26.614
Mr. Callen,
thank you very much

41:26.658 --> 41:29.574
for the background information
on the incident

41:29.617 --> 41:32.054
and on Agent Kolcheck.

41:32.098 --> 41:34.013
Now, this panel is
very much interested

41:34.056 --> 41:36.102
in what you saw
when you came through the door.

41:36.145 --> 41:38.844
Did you see Mr. Sokolov

41:38.887 --> 41:42.891
pull a weapon
on Agent Kolcheck?

41:42.935 --> 41:45.546
We both knew that
Mr. Sokolov had a weapon.

41:45.590 --> 41:49.028
Your report stated that
you think you saw Mr. Sokolov

41:49.071 --> 41:53.075
reach for his weapon
before he was shot.

41:53.119 --> 41:54.729
But you never saw this,
did you?

41:54.773 --> 41:59.255
Like I said, we both knew
he had a weapon, so he...

41:59.299 --> 42:00.300
We're not interested

42:00.343 --> 42:02.824
in whether or not
he had a weapon

42:02.868 --> 42:06.567
at some point
beforehe was shot.

42:08.787 --> 42:10.092
Mr. Callen...

42:12.791 --> 42:16.925
...did you see Mr. Sokolov
in possession of

42:16.969 --> 42:21.277
or reaching for a weapon
of any kind

42:21.321 --> 42:23.976
directly before

42:24.019 --> 42:26.456
he was shot by Agent Kolcheck?

42:32.550 --> 42:35.683
Special Agent Callen,

42:35.727 --> 42:37.772
please answer the question.
