00:42.710 --> 00:44.310
- Today's story ends.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.520
It was all over the news,

00:48.520 --> 00:50.270
It says Frankie Moore was troubled.

00:51.950 --> 00:54.310
All that most people saw
was a homeless kid wandering

00:54.310 --> 00:55.250
the streets.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.080
A Killer on the run.

00:57.950 --> 01:00.180
The truth as always is
far more complicated.

01:06.930 --> 01:10.040
Frankie was just one of
the many dispossessed,

01:10.040 --> 01:11.350
ignored, hated

01:13.170 --> 01:14.170
but I knew him.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.250
I was there at the beginning.

01:18.110 --> 01:19.940
And I was there at the end.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.600
- No batteries?

01:47.600 --> 01:48.950
- It's not battery powered.

01:50.030 --> 01:51.710
- How does it work then?

01:51.710 --> 01:52.760
- Why do you want to know?

01:52.760 --> 01:54.500
- I'm curious.

01:54.500 --> 01:55.800
- Are you?

01:55.800 --> 01:56.630
- Okay, bored.

01:59.170 --> 02:01.170
- I built something
called a Stirling engine-

02:01.170 --> 02:02.000
- Mm-hmm.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.620
You're a clever one.

02:03.620 --> 02:04.450
- I don't know

02:04.450 --> 02:05.280
about that.

02:08.020 --> 02:10.560
- Do you want to work for
my dad when you're older?

02:11.390 --> 02:12.440
- An inventor.

02:12.440 --> 02:16.500
Nowadays he says he's a philanthropist.

02:18.020 --> 02:19.020
- What's that?

02:19.020 --> 02:21.720
- If people build things
for him, he makes them rich,

02:23.340 --> 02:24.170
that's what he says.

02:24.170 --> 02:25.440
- Where is he now?

02:25.440 --> 02:26.270
- In a meeting.

02:29.890 --> 02:30.920
- He tells you you know?

02:30.920 --> 02:32.130
- What's he going to do?

02:32.130 --> 02:33.110
Run me over?

02:36.540 --> 02:37.680
Come on,

02:37.680 --> 02:39.580
Show me the rest of your town big guy.

02:40.510 --> 02:41.620
- My name's Frankie.

02:43.160 --> 02:48.060
- I'm Nicole not Nikki, or Nick or Nicola.

02:48.060 --> 02:49.830
Don't you dare call me Nicola.

02:53.290 --> 02:55.360
- You're funny.

03:15.810 --> 03:17.310
Do you think fish have dreams?

03:19.070 --> 03:23.620
- No fish are just fish.

03:25.210 --> 03:27.200
- You don't reckon they

03:27.200 --> 03:28.280
at the surface.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.220
Everything looks so
different for them though.

03:37.010 --> 03:38.980
- You know, I thought i met some

03:40.990 --> 03:43.310
seaweed boys in my time but you.

03:50.800 --> 03:51.720
Hey, daddy.

03:52.910 --> 03:54.110
This is a pity you left.

03:55.530 --> 03:56.360
But

03:57.310 --> 03:58.140
fine.

04:01.570 --> 04:02.400
I'm coming.

04:05.810 --> 04:06.640
He's mad at me.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.310
- Where's he now?

04:10.870 --> 04:11.700
You know it?

04:34.610 --> 04:37.910
- Just remember that my offer
does have an expiry date.

04:38.960 --> 04:39.790
Mr. Langford.

04:39.790 --> 04:41.020
- Frankie?

04:41.020 --> 04:41.910
- Hi Mr. Langford.

04:43.470 --> 04:45.940
- He is a nice chap Frankie.

04:45.940 --> 04:47.680
- So why did you fry your start?

04:48.790 --> 04:51.360
- Mr. Langford this is
my daughter, Nicole.

04:52.270 --> 04:54.140
She's very much like me.

04:54.140 --> 04:58.040
Once an idea occurs she
pursues it regardless of cost

04:59.900 --> 05:04.410
It's our calling, helping
people build their ideas into

05:04.410 --> 05:05.490
reality,

05:05.490 --> 05:09.120
- As I said, I will
certainly consider your offer

05:09.120 --> 05:09.950
Mr.

05:09.950 --> 05:12.280
- We must be getting back to the city.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.670
It's soon night after all.

05:17.380 --> 05:19.040
- See you fish boy.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.090
- My name is Frankie.

05:23.150 --> 05:25.150
- So, how is your dad doing?

05:26.690 --> 05:27.940
- He's fine Mr. Langford.

05:29.950 --> 05:31.290
We're fine.

05:52.290 --> 05:54.760
- Hi,

05:58.660 --> 05:59.740
- I was playing with a
girl from out of town.

06:00.720 --> 06:01.550
- Oh yeah.

06:02.510 --> 06:07.320
- Why isn't anything like
that mum

06:07.320 --> 06:10.860
- Franklin, we've talked
about that before.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.570
Dad and I don't want you
hanging around there anymore.

06:20.170 --> 06:21.490
- So, what's cooking?

06:22.840 --> 06:24.340
- You're cooking mate.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.340
- I thought was cooking.

06:27.340 --> 06:28.890
Fish and peas

06:28.890 --> 06:30.470
and of course I love fish and peas.

06:30.470 --> 06:32.460
- Hey,

06:32.460 --> 06:34.840
- Lot's of ketchup.

07:14.050 --> 07:15.960
- It's great food love.

07:17.980 --> 07:18.810
- Thanks.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.090
It makes a nice difference
to fish fingers and peas

07:22.090 --> 07:23.340
in front of the TV right?

07:25.470 --> 07:27.300
- I love fish fingers.

07:33.010 --> 07:34.140
- You can have them tomorrow.

07:35.720 --> 07:36.670
brain food fishes.

07:43.310 --> 07:46.510
- You looking forward to
going back to school Frankie?

07:46.510 --> 07:47.340
- I guess.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.100
- Remember what Miss Simon said?

07:52.100 --> 07:53.030
You're right boy.

07:55.860 --> 07:57.340
Don't you let your mind wander out.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.950
- I reckon these teachers
are just jealous.

08:03.740 --> 08:06.770
Probably wish that they had
as big an imagination as you.

08:08.140 --> 08:10.940
- Just try to teach the
boy to be pragmatic Abbie.

08:10.940 --> 08:11.770
- I'm sorry.

08:14.020 --> 08:16.270
How'd it go at the

08:16.270 --> 08:18.890
- How many times have I got
to tell you the day out there

08:18.890 --> 08:19.720
is bloody slow?

08:19.720 --> 08:22.260
- Yeah, well, Sunday for a
little while isn't it you know

08:22.260 --> 08:25.070
what once we've got some more
money you can get a computer

08:25.070 --> 08:28.950
or something and then or what
then then you can spend all

08:28.950 --> 08:30.260
day looking for work.

08:32.059 --> 08:34.169
- Don't you think that's
what I'm doing now?

08:34.169 --> 08:35.630
- I didn't mean it like that.

08:35.630 --> 08:37.870
- Maybe I don't have a
vivid enough imagination.

08:39.350 --> 08:40.860
Sit down Franklin.

08:40.860 --> 08:42.539
- Please may I go upstairs?

08:43.580 --> 08:44.410
- What?

08:48.780 --> 08:49.720
You don't want any dessert?

08:49.720 --> 08:50.720
I will get you all some strawberries.

08:52.730 --> 08:53.810
- Sure, okay.

09:05.290 --> 09:07.090
- Why don't I do the washing
up and you get going on

09:07.090 --> 09:09.800
to

09:09.800 --> 09:11.200
- I love what you're thinking Mrs. Moore.

09:27.950 --> 09:30.950
- Do you mind folding up the chairs?

09:47.560 --> 09:50.390
- Eat nicely Frankie, no one wants a pig.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.620
- Now leave him alone, he's a growing boy.

09:53.790 --> 09:54.620
- He's growing into a pig.

10:00.150 --> 10:02.530
- I

10:02.530 --> 10:04.080
They are looking for engineers.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.200
- I'm not an engineer.

10:08.110 --> 10:09.060
I was never was an engineer.

10:09.950 --> 10:11.060
- Yeah, I know but Langford-

10:11.060 --> 10:13.150
- Langford was a shipbuilder.

10:13.150 --> 10:16.350
Me I took the
Kansas and boathouse.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.130
I wasn't a fucking engineer.

10:20.450 --> 10:21.480
- I'm sorry I didn't think.

10:21.480 --> 10:22.690
- No you didn't think.

10:24.210 --> 10:28.700
And I don't want about work
no more again tonight, right?

10:28.700 --> 10:32.160
- Now follow me.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.990
- Aye, aye captain.

10:36.230 --> 10:37.500
- Let me try to help.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.150
- You can't help him.

10:47.030 --> 10:47.860
And if you start talking about work,

10:47.860 --> 10:49.790
think before open your mouth.

10:51.940 --> 10:52.770
Allright?

10:54.680 --> 10:56.580
I'm trying to think
practically about things

10:56.580 --> 10:59.840
and all you're doing is fill
Frankie's head with nonsense.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.400
You can go and rant it
jerky place.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.730
You mollycoddled him all his life

11:06.730 --> 11:09.220
and now he knows more
about things

11:09.220 --> 11:10.980
than he does normal life.

11:10.980 --> 11:12.430
- Are yoU ashamed of our son?

11:13.300 --> 11:14.490
- Don't go putting words in my mouth.

11:14.490 --> 11:16.360
Stop giving me shit.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.950
I'm thinking practically
about these things.

11:18.950 --> 11:22.090
You pat him on the head for
being a dreamer that is on you.

11:25.190 --> 11:26.020
- Frankie,

11:27.740 --> 11:29.680
why don't you go up to bed?

11:29.680 --> 11:32.630
Hey, I will tuck you in
at night

11:32.630 --> 11:34.690
- That is pathetic.

11:34.690 --> 11:36.440
You are going to go up
upstairs and tuck him in like

11:36.440 --> 11:37.310
he's a toddler.

11:43.350 --> 11:47.010
- I hope you are happy with yourself.

11:48.900 --> 11:49.730
- Do you?

11:50.980 --> 11:52.500
- Our son has gifts.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.580
And you are letting him down.

11:54.580 --> 11:55.730
- I'm letting him down.

11:55.730 --> 11:57.830
I'm fucking letting him down.

11:57.830 --> 12:00.490
Allright, is that what you said?

12:03.410 --> 12:04.850
This is your fault.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.680
This is what you made me do.

12:35.740 --> 12:37.160
- Not nice.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.080
It's not right.

12:41.050 --> 12:43.250
- Sometimes grownups fight Frankie.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.810
Just like children.

12:48.740 --> 12:49.840
- That wasn't a fight.

12:54.960 --> 12:58.530
- One day I'll take you way far away.

12:58.530 --> 13:00.500
When my boat full sized.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.550
- That's nice.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.960
This is the real life Frankie.

13:15.000 --> 13:15.830
And he needs me,

13:22.930 --> 13:24.040
The world is a cruel place Frankie,

13:24.040 --> 13:25.890
I'm sorry for teaching you different.

13:27.960 --> 13:30.630
And a cruel world it

13:30.630 --> 13:32.880
can get in people's head
and make more wrong.

13:36.620 --> 13:37.590
- Doesn't matter who he is.

13:37.590 --> 13:39.280
I think a lot is what he does.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.970
- I know that's quite clever.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.150
But have I ever told you

13:46.150 --> 13:48.010
how smart you are?

13:48.010 --> 13:49.300
- All the time.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.070
- Yeah just like granddad Charlie.

13:54.070 --> 13:57.550
He was a one and
a dreamer and just like you.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.110
I have to tell you, he gave me this.

14:04.710 --> 14:05.840
- Yeah

14:05.840 --> 14:07.780
- Yeah, he gave me this.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.240
When you were born,

14:14.920 --> 14:17.000
- Can you tell me please?

14:19.850 --> 14:24.790
- Come here,

14:24.790 --> 14:26.690
why don't you hold on to that?

14:26.690 --> 14:29.850
Till the world becomes a better place.

14:32.560 --> 14:37.560
Oh Frankie.

18:39.130 --> 18:41.820
- Do you know where
your son is Mrs. Moore?

18:41.820 --> 18:45.240
Mrs. Moore do you know where your son is?

19:24.820 --> 19:28.680
- Right, just grab it and run
fast enough that I don't catch

19:29.680 --> 19:32.510
up, slow enough that
the dog will snort you.

19:32.510 --> 19:34.540
I will just need to
get distracted a while.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.240
I need time to get in there.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.210
- Just be quick about it okay?

19:37.210 --> 19:38.710
- That's it boy, there you go.

19:59.310 --> 20:02.810
- Hey, you plan on paying paying for that?

20:06.200 --> 20:07.260
- I'm sorry I-

20:07.260 --> 20:08.220
- Stealing off me?

20:10.310 --> 20:14.760
- Please, you don't have any
problems of a little grill?

20:15.850 --> 20:17.220
Sometimes it won't turn on.

20:20.650 --> 20:21.650
- And your point is?

20:22.690 --> 20:25.240
- You need to replace switch.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.070
I can fix it.

20:27.300 --> 20:29.310
- But in exchange for that
I'm going to give you popcorn.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.630
Well come on then.

21:01.250 --> 21:03.660
- You should have run faster.

21:13.280 --> 21:15.890
That girl in the wheelchair, get her bag.

21:17.390 --> 21:18.850
- Why?

21:18.850 --> 21:22.960
Sick people have pills,
painkillers, stuff to sell.

21:22.960 --> 21:23.790
Go.

21:53.590 --> 21:55.420
- Frankie, stop.

21:58.190 --> 21:59.410
It's you, isn't it?

22:01.090 --> 22:02.450
- Yeah.

22:02.450 --> 22:04.630
So, it's good to see you, Nicole.

22:04.630 --> 22:06.100
- Frankie, is it true?

22:08.210 --> 22:09.150
Frankie?

22:09.150 --> 22:11.010
- He was hurting my mum.

22:12.450 --> 22:15.340
- Meet me at front
entrance, tomorrow, okay.

22:56.850 --> 22:58.660
Have you been sleeping on the streets?

22:58.660 --> 22:59.490
- Yes.

23:01.100 --> 23:02.580
- You are just a kid.

23:02.580 --> 23:04.830
- Yeah and I'm like two
years younger than you.

23:04.830 --> 23:07.990
- Exactly, I sleep in a penthouse.

23:07.990 --> 23:08.820
- That's hard to believe.

23:08.820 --> 23:11.000
- Frankie, you can't stay out here.

23:12.460 --> 23:14.030
- I can't go home.

23:14.030 --> 23:15.680
- So if you're in hiding,

23:16.900 --> 23:18.780
why would you come on a busy playground?

23:23.010 --> 23:24.140
- Where's the bag,

23:24.140 --> 23:25.390
- Thief.

23:25.390 --> 23:28.300
- Leave him alone.

23:32.590 --> 23:36.410
- Either you swipe to or you didn't.

23:36.410 --> 23:39.910
If you want to stay at
our place, come to me.

23:39.910 --> 23:41.470
- I will call the police.

23:41.470 --> 23:43.460
- Hey my little princess.

23:43.460 --> 23:44.300
None of your business.

23:44.300 --> 23:49.300
- Police

23:49.330 --> 23:50.610
- Shit.

24:25.530 --> 24:28.290
- Get yourself some
better friends fish boy.

24:28.290 --> 24:29.580
- I better go.

24:29.580 --> 24:32.800
I'm sorry

24:32.800 --> 24:33.990
- Stay safe, okay?

26:13.940 --> 26:15.910
I haven't seen you around
for a couple of weeks.

26:17.860 --> 26:18.690
- Yeah,

26:18.690 --> 26:19.520
They kicked us out of the old church.

26:19.520 --> 26:20.350
- What?

26:22.030 --> 26:23.640
- I barely had even the
time to gather my tools.

26:23.640 --> 26:26.290
- You are still
parlor of yours

26:26.290 --> 26:30.740
- Yeah, to the
riverside apparently there's

26:32.140 --> 26:33.750
some safe place to stay.

26:33.750 --> 26:36.070
- Or you could be sensible
and go to the hospital.

26:43.170 --> 26:44.000
- Hungry?

26:47.880 --> 26:49.240
- Look, this is why it's
going to work, right?

26:50.390 --> 26:51.220
- I'm going to pretend there's
a problem with the grill.

26:51.220 --> 26:52.710
You're going to fix it and then
I'm going to give you a hot

26:52.710 --> 26:54.940
dog, we just skipped the ritual this time.

27:02.820 --> 27:03.650
Boom

27:07.240 --> 27:08.150
- Thanks man.

27:08.150 --> 27:09.510
- Don't worry about it.

27:09.510 --> 27:10.340
Just remember it's my birthday

27:10.340 --> 27:11.180
next month.

27:11.180 --> 27:12.260
- Get you a card?

27:12.260 --> 27:13.280
- Never mind the card.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.530
You just sort that hair out.

27:15.530 --> 27:16.420
It's ridiculous.

27:19.520 --> 27:20.440
- Piss off.

28:26.650 --> 28:27.970
- Stay away from me.

28:27.970 --> 28:29.070
All right.

28:29.070 --> 28:29.910
I mean it.

28:31.030 --> 28:31.860
I'm warning you.

28:31.860 --> 28:34.510
- I'm just like you
I'm just like you.

28:34.510 --> 28:35.340
Are you like me?

28:35.340 --> 28:36.440
You know nothing about me.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.000
Okay, I need this.

28:40.690 --> 28:41.520
I need it.

28:42.370 --> 28:43.810
- Go on look in the case.

28:53.270 --> 28:57.090
- These are just tools.

28:57.090 --> 28:59.950
What do you want me to do with them?

28:59.950 --> 29:00.850
I need money.

29:02.940 --> 29:06.890
Seriously, I need money.

29:06.890 --> 29:08.390
- It's all I have.

29:26.940 --> 29:28.440
- It's a doggy dog world mate.

29:31.460 --> 29:32.830
Being nice will get you killed.

29:34.520 --> 29:35.350
- I know you.

29:36.500 --> 29:37.550
You used to run with Viv.

29:41.250 --> 29:42.080
- Just calm down, man.

29:42.080 --> 29:42.920
Calm down.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.660
- Hey, babe

30:19.660 --> 30:20.520
- Hey Nicole.

30:20.520 --> 30:21.710
- Are you at yours?

30:23.560 --> 30:24.850
- Yes, come over.

30:25.690 --> 30:28.140
- Can I yeah, I'm not
feeling all that right now.

30:30.890 --> 30:34.540
- Yeah, I just need
something to help me relax.

31:53.390 --> 31:56.430
- Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

31:56.430 --> 31:57.600
- I was just practicing.

31:57.600 --> 31:59.250
- I wish I could dance like that.

32:07.110 --> 32:08.930
- I'm I doing this?

32:08.930 --> 32:13.930
Hey, let me show you some moves.

32:14.090 --> 32:14.920
- Really?

32:17.170 --> 32:19.330
Not ready to trust for that.

32:19.330 --> 32:20.370
- It's all right.

32:20.370 --> 32:21.220
What's your name?

32:22.130 --> 32:25.290
Frankie Moore.

32:27.170 --> 32:28.050
- All right.

32:28.050 --> 32:29.470
I'm Jess.

32:29.470 --> 32:33.000
Allright so have you ever danced before?

32:34.180 --> 32:35.560
No.

32:35.560 --> 32:38.280
Okay, so put your feet
together just like that.

32:38.280 --> 32:43.280
And let's make the round
arms, round with further down.

33:25.560 --> 33:28.720
- That really lifted my low.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.520
I was just being chased before this.

33:32.580 --> 33:33.590
Thank you Jess.

33:36.950 --> 33:38.300
- Who are you running from?

33:42.280 --> 33:43.490
- Those are different people.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.060
Doesn't matter.

33:46.060 --> 33:47.110
Happens all the time.

33:51.010 --> 33:52.510
- That's not really an answer.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.620
- It was better dancing than running.

34:06.680 --> 34:08.860
- You must be hungry from all the running.

34:09.900 --> 34:10.730
- No, no, no, no, it's okay.

34:10.730 --> 34:12.139
- Come on it's just
and carrots.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.940
- I'd love some carrots.

34:16.940 --> 34:17.770
- Yes.

34:17.770 --> 34:18.600
- Okay.

34:31.380 --> 34:32.210
It's beautiful.

34:34.250 --> 34:37.270
- Yeah, it's my favorite spot.

34:42.770 --> 34:44.170
- Do you want one?

34:44.170 --> 34:45.230
- Yeah.

35:05.040 --> 35:05.890
- Nicole it's me.

35:35.230 --> 35:38.320
- Frankie Moore,

35:42.150 --> 35:45.810
and now I'm going to
leave you with nothing.

35:48.400 --> 35:51.160
I want to hurt you

35:55.650 --> 35:57.310
Take all of his clothes off.

35:57.310 --> 35:58.310
all of them.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.100
Take them off now, take them off.

36:01.100 --> 36:02.310
- Off you bitch.

36:02.310 --> 36:03.640
- Take them off.

36:54.450 --> 36:56.610
- You need help my friend.

37:04.960 --> 37:09.900
Come on.

37:09.900 --> 37:12.650
You want to be more careful yeah.

37:53.190 --> 37:54.020
- Hey

37:54.020 --> 37:54.860
Frankie

37:55.930 --> 38:00.540
get a burger and a hot dog or
whatever processed sludge meat

38:00.540 --> 38:01.590
your friend gave you.

38:03.830 --> 38:04.800
I'm just kidding you.

38:04.800 --> 38:08.070
Your friend he's a nice man.

38:08.070 --> 38:10.980
His food isn't worth a shit.

38:10.980 --> 38:11.980
He's a nice fella

38:15.250 --> 38:18.470
Nice tires over here out of
the way I might burn one later.

38:20.010 --> 38:24.820
I used that that foil
wrapper and battery trick you

38:24.820 --> 38:26.330
taught me.

38:26.330 --> 38:27.890
A clever one I'll give you that.

38:27.890 --> 38:29.860
Me I'm the handsome one

38:35.350 --> 38:36.890
Shit Frankie, what the hell happened?

38:36.890 --> 38:37.720
What happened?

38:37.720 --> 38:38.740
No no no no no.

38:38.740 --> 38:40.930
Talk to me.

38:40.930 --> 38:41.760
- It's just Viv.

38:43.350 --> 38:44.180
- Viv?

38:47.160 --> 38:50.770
Did she violate you?

38:50.770 --> 38:52.270
- No, it's okay.

38:52.270 --> 38:55.600
- But we've got to do something.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.600
In fact we need to call the cops on her.

38:58.510 --> 39:01.450
- No

39:01.450 --> 39:03.050
- we have got to do something I mean what-

39:03.050 --> 39:03.970
- No, nothing.

39:08.050 --> 39:09.350
- What else is it Frankie?

39:11.570 --> 39:14.180
No, there's something else happening.

39:14.180 --> 39:17.510
- Just saw

39:17.510 --> 39:18.340
- Who?

39:24.970 --> 39:29.970
Well, if you want to talk
I've got no place to go.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.750
Put too much wood in there.

39:38.440 --> 39:39.890
There's a tire in the bottom.

39:41.930 --> 39:43.250
It might burn all night.

39:47.060 --> 39:48.560
- Sounds allright.

39:49.640 --> 39:50.480
- Sure is.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.720
- Come on, come on friends.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.480
One man's trash is another man's

40:02.480 --> 40:04.860
treasure as they say, right buddy.

40:04.860 --> 40:07.350
Point is ladies and gentlemen,
what you've been looking

40:07.350 --> 40:09.370
for is right at your bedside.

40:09.370 --> 40:12.580
And my good associate here
Frankie has repurposed

40:12.580 --> 40:16.710
reconditioned and recycled
everything that you in fact need.

40:16.710 --> 40:18.340
We have it right here.

40:18.340 --> 40:21.630
Take a look take a gander
find what you're looking for.

40:21.630 --> 40:24.680
Now everything looks like
a normal everyday item

40:24.680 --> 40:27.840
But in fact, they've all
been reconditioned to fit in

40:27.840 --> 40:30.540
your household very uniquely.

40:30.540 --> 40:33.290
Something you won't find it
your department stores, no.

40:34.130 --> 40:36.410
Something of very modern fashion.

40:36.410 --> 40:39.490
It looks like an ordinary
camera at some point it made

40:39.490 --> 40:43.020
memories but in fact,
it's been repurposed to a-

40:43.020 --> 40:44.030
- Radio.

40:44.030 --> 40:44.860
- What?

40:44.860 --> 40:46.250
- Radio.

40:46.250 --> 40:49.280
- It has been repurposed
to also be a radio.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.740
So that while you're making
memories, you can play your

40:51.740 --> 40:53.500
favorite melody.

40:55.060 --> 40:59.530
Why in my day, we call
this in fact a slingshot.

40:59.530 --> 41:03.020
It was quite used to take
down the occasional squirrel

41:03.020 --> 41:03.850
for dinner.

41:05.010 --> 41:07.420
Mark Twain, I think that'll
serve you quite well.

41:07.420 --> 41:09.440
That's just one pound now.

41:09.440 --> 41:10.390
Oh, thank you.

41:10.390 --> 41:12.000
Bless you, ma'am.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
Bless you.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
- Thank you.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
- All right.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.530
Well, just remember one
man's trash is another man's

41:16.530 --> 41:17.360
treasure.

41:18.490 --> 41:19.530
Pretty good day.

41:20.450 --> 41:21.880
- I enjoyed it thank you.

41:21.880 --> 41:25.000
Sounds

41:25.000 --> 41:25.850
- I suppose I do.

41:26.910 --> 41:29.290
I always liked when I was a
little kid going to the circus

41:29.290 --> 41:31.690
and seeing that guy down
the middle of the ring.

41:32.800 --> 41:34.750
I guess I'm just a showman at heart.

41:35.620 --> 41:36.670
- You are good at it.

41:37.970 --> 41:41.070
- The main thing is we got
enough to replenish our supplies.

41:42.440 --> 41:44.220
Get some real food.

41:44.220 --> 41:45.620
I'm going to go have a look.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.240
- Right back up.

42:02.070 --> 42:02.900
- Strawberries.

42:06.390 --> 42:07.820
- Chico, is that

42:07.820 --> 42:10.260
I haven't seen him since last winter.

42:10.260 --> 42:15.260
Chico

42:15.570 --> 42:17.150
- I will be damned.

42:21.920 --> 42:22.760
Prince.

42:22.760 --> 42:24.350
You old rascal.

42:24.350 --> 42:26.680
I haven't seen you in years.

42:30.270 --> 42:31.950
Man play that song.

42:34.740 --> 42:37.160
Oh, yeah.

42:40.980 --> 42:42.440
What's wrong with these people?

42:42.440 --> 42:44.850
Frankie, come on?

42:44.850 --> 42:46.620
Come say hi to Prince.

43:39.900 --> 43:40.910
Bless you

43:40.910 --> 43:42.030
Thank you.

43:42.030 --> 43:43.430
We will appreciate you ma'am.

43:43.430 --> 43:45.090
Allright, thank you.

43:47.350 --> 43:49.640
Hey not bad.

43:49.640 --> 43:50.470
- Oh my God-

43:50.470 --> 43:51.670
- Not bad at all.

43:51.670 --> 43:53.770
- Oh my God, is this money?

43:53.770 --> 43:54.960
- It's all yours.

43:55.910 --> 43:57.860
- 30 years I have been doing this shit.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.560
I couldn't make a coffee sometime.

44:01.560 --> 44:04.460
And you come along, dance like an idiot.

44:04.460 --> 44:06.000
And making me some money

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
- I aim to please.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.200
Good to see you brother.

44:09.200 --> 44:10.300
- Good to see you bro.

44:12.240 --> 44:14.460
Frankie is still hanging
around with this old brat?

44:14.460 --> 44:17.230
- Yeah, well, you know Chico,
it's always entertaining

44:18.160 --> 44:19.180
friends.

44:20.180 --> 44:21.020
- Who are two friends here?

44:21.020 --> 44:21.930
- Man.

44:21.930 --> 44:22.980
Let me introduce you.

44:22.980 --> 44:24.400
Eva.

44:24.400 --> 44:25.400
- Hi.

44:25.400 --> 44:26.750
- She came to this country
looking for a better life.

44:26.750 --> 44:28.560
And a friend Al.

44:28.560 --> 44:30.260
He just left the army.

44:30.260 --> 44:31.380
- Good to meet you.

44:31.380 --> 44:33.800
- We been sleeping in
some abandoned buildings.

44:33.800 --> 44:34.800
Not too far from here.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.240
- Yeah?

44:36.240 --> 44:37.240
- At the edge of the Industrial Estate.

44:37.240 --> 44:40.060
- Frankie and I were
thinking about heading

44:40.060 --> 44:41.060
to the waterfront.

44:41.060 --> 44:43.020
They got some places down there we hear.

44:43.860 --> 44:44.690
- My brother from

44:44.690 --> 44:46.560
another mother
- Brother from another

44:46.560 --> 44:47.580
mother man.

44:47.580 --> 44:49.080
- If I don't see you
tomorrow, hello today.

44:49.080 --> 44:51.500
- You got it going on dude,
you got the dancing going on

44:51.500 --> 44:52.460
man.

44:52.460 --> 44:53.860
You need some lessons, dude.

44:54.810 --> 44:56.240
Frankie, pleasure man.

45:14.930 --> 45:16.980
- This feels weird.

45:16.980 --> 45:19.910
I don't exactly have my sea legs

45:22.850 --> 45:27.720
- I always pictured myself
sailing away on one of these

45:27.720 --> 45:29.820
things, you know leaving it all behind it.

45:32.820 --> 45:34.280
- Really?

45:34.280 --> 45:39.120
Is it possible to be seasick
if you're technically

45:39.120 --> 45:40.980
still on land?

45:44.220 --> 45:45.270
- Jeez, Frankie.

45:47.520 --> 45:48.430
I mean, I know your fascination

45:48.430 --> 45:51.040
with machines, but I've
never known you had interest

45:51.040 --> 45:52.650
in boats.

45:52.650 --> 45:54.170
- Yeah.

45:54.170 --> 45:55.190
I made a promise.

45:57.600 --> 45:58.960
- Promise is a promise.

46:10.800 --> 46:11.640
- You allright?

46:11.640 --> 46:12.470
- Yeah.

46:14.570 --> 46:15.890
- Nice digs.

46:37.250 --> 46:38.650
- You should go home mate.

46:38.650 --> 46:40.200
- It's nothing.

46:40.200 --> 46:41.960
It's just a tickle.

46:41.960 --> 46:42.790
- Just a tickle?

46:50.080 --> 46:52.960
I want to talk to you about something.

46:52.960 --> 46:53.790
I don't know.

46:53.790 --> 46:55.140
Advice, I suppose.

46:55.140 --> 46:56.840
- So you are going to ask
a bloke who sells hot dogs

46:56.840 --> 46:58.040
for a living for advice?

47:00.070 --> 47:02.780
I'm not the brightest
bulb on the bubble mate.

47:02.780 --> 47:05.400
- Yeah, but you've lived
much longer than me mate.

47:05.400 --> 47:06.580
- Well, thank you very much for that.

47:08.430 --> 47:11.490
So what is it young man?

47:11.490 --> 47:14.140
What is it that's bothering
you apart from the whole

47:14.140 --> 47:15.350
destitute thing?

47:27.820 --> 47:29.570
Just got me thinking.

47:30.790 --> 47:32.040
- I'm sensing a question.

47:39.270 --> 47:40.670
- Just how long is too long?

47:42.750 --> 47:45.740
I know you think if I could I just

47:47.740 --> 47:49.200
go home.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.310
- Why are you asking me this?

47:50.310 --> 47:51.660
Why don't you ask your pal.

47:55.500 --> 47:56.600
- Chico is

47:58.550 --> 48:00.700
he's involved and y'all know Gavin.

48:02.930 --> 48:07.680
- Oh, so the only person you
could think to talk to is me.

48:08.540 --> 48:12.110
- Well, I think your
answers right then mate.

48:12.960 --> 48:15.040
When the only company you
can keep us in an old fool,

48:15.040 --> 48:18.560
then perhaps a journey home
is exactly what you should be

48:18.560 --> 48:19.390
doing.

48:23.930 --> 48:26.380
You're lucky enough to
have a home to go home to.

49:36.530 --> 49:37.360
- Nicole.

49:41.220 --> 49:43.080
It's me, fish boy.

49:45.880 --> 49:46.710
Frankie

49:52.670 --> 49:53.500
- Frankie.

49:54.850 --> 49:56.040
- I won't bite.

49:58.480 --> 50:00.280
Do you mind to go to a walk with me?

50:12.200 --> 50:14.420
Look I'm about to meet a friend.

50:15.600 --> 50:17.340
You will like him, he's nice.

50:21.130 --> 50:22.280
Would you like to come?

50:25.440 --> 50:26.560
Let's see where I live.

50:27.880 --> 50:29.860
it's not nothing special but

50:32.380 --> 50:33.210
It's a home.

50:34.150 --> 50:35.390
- Yeah, sure.

50:37.230 --> 50:38.060
- Cool.

50:42.940 --> 50:44.440
- Where is it?

50:44.440 --> 50:45.280
Here?

50:48.000 --> 50:49.450
- They are good people.

50:49.450 --> 50:50.300
Very good people.

51:32.780 --> 51:35.690
- So yeah, I felt it was
pretty much the last place

51:35.690 --> 51:36.590
we saw each other.

51:38.920 --> 51:42.400
So I guess that means,
you've known Frankie longest.

51:43.380 --> 51:44.210
- Yeah.

51:46.400 --> 51:47.690
- Tell me something.

51:49.520 --> 51:51.020
Was he always this fucking boring.

51:51.980 --> 51:54.200
I mean boy is boring, right?

51:57.620 --> 52:01.720
- I haven't seen fish boy for so long.

52:01.720 --> 52:04.590
- Fish boy so you notice the smell too?

52:06.100 --> 52:07.220
- What?

52:07.220 --> 52:08.050
I don't smell.

52:08.050 --> 52:08.890
- Are you kidding me?

52:08.890 --> 52:10.920
Seagulls fly around thinking
you're a big sardine

52:10.920 --> 52:12.330
waiting to pick your eyes out.

52:12.330 --> 52:15.300
- Sorry listen, I suppose
that is your friend.

52:15.300 --> 52:17.480
- I'm not the one being called fish boy.

52:17.480 --> 52:18.900
Right?

52:18.900 --> 52:20.990
I mean, it smells like a fish.

52:24.010 --> 52:27.610
I think it will be a
little hard on Frankie.

52:27.610 --> 52:30.220
Old lads been picked on enough.

52:31.670 --> 52:32.500
Prince,

52:34.060 --> 52:35.220
Play that song.

52:39.270 --> 52:40.900
- Do you mean the one you like?

52:40.900 --> 52:42.350
- You know, yeah, the one I like,

52:42.350 --> 52:43.180
play that one.

52:44.620 --> 52:45.450
- No problem dude.

52:45.450 --> 52:47.620
No problem.

52:50.160 --> 52:51.000
- Check it out man.

53:12.760 --> 53:13.600
- I like him.

53:13.600 --> 53:14.430
- Chico.

53:14.430 --> 53:15.990
- Yeah.

53:15.990 --> 53:17.710
- Yeah he's great.

53:17.710 --> 53:18.830
- When you live like I do.

53:18.830 --> 53:21.530
It's good to have someone
like that to have your back.

53:25.220 --> 53:28.850
- That's what I want to ask you actually.

53:28.850 --> 53:30.670
Have you been out on the
streets all these winters?

53:31.690 --> 53:32.520
- Yeah.

53:34.860 --> 53:36.160
- State has some shelters.

53:38.650 --> 53:39.900
roofs as big as this one.

53:42.540 --> 53:44.140
Keeping a low profile when you're homeless

53:44.140 --> 53:45.990
pretty much invisible to most people.

53:47.810 --> 53:50.330
- So what you energy goes
just traveling around now?

53:51.900 --> 53:54.190
Wait, you said you can
remember you me as a kid.

53:55.230 --> 53:57.270
When did you meet them?

53:57.270 --> 53:58.100
- Three years ago.

53:58.100 --> 54:00.270
Left his job just walked
away from his old life.

54:03.030 --> 54:05.130
- Wait, he just willingly became homeless?

54:06.020 --> 54:07.030
That's insane.

54:08.650 --> 54:11.760
- I just wanted to be
where people were Nicole.

54:11.760 --> 54:14.880
Where tools were, build my things.

54:14.880 --> 54:16.710
Besides me and Chico
make money for supplies.

54:16.710 --> 54:18.830
- So what, you two just
been piling around together

54:18.830 --> 54:19.660
ever since?

54:22.550 --> 54:23.380
- Yeah.

54:23.380 --> 54:24.300
- As I'm a psychic.

54:30.540 --> 54:32.960
- You were always a serious young boy.

54:32.960 --> 54:34.660
- Those were serious times Nicole.

54:36.620 --> 54:38.190
- Do you ever think about your dad?

54:41.590 --> 54:42.420
- Obvious.

54:45.110 --> 54:45.940
- Your mom

55:01.760 --> 55:04.240
- Had a boyfriend, had a girlfriend.

55:05.620 --> 55:06.770
Had a better boyfriend.

55:08.020 --> 55:10.220
I lost the
for about six weeks.

55:13.560 --> 55:15.910
- it's pretty funny full
book about investment.

55:16.830 --> 55:18.700
- My dad will love him.

55:18.700 --> 55:20.250
No matter how hard he makes it.

55:31.930 --> 55:32.770
- Things okay with you guys?

55:34.120 --> 55:35.300
- No.

55:35.300 --> 55:40.300
Kind of

55:48.570 --> 55:49.650
I love these things.

55:49.650 --> 55:50.990
- Do you want to buy one?

55:53.190 --> 55:55.270
- Do you want to buy one?

55:56.870 --> 55:59.010
Allright, maybe a bit later.

55:59.010 --> 56:00.260
- Does your dad hurt you?

56:03.870 --> 56:04.700
- What?

56:07.710 --> 56:08.930
No, nothing like that.

56:08.930 --> 56:10.990
Frankie he is not an evil man,

56:10.990 --> 56:14.500
I just wish he cared less
about profit margins.

56:14.500 --> 56:15.330
That's all.

56:17.050 --> 56:19.280
- I wish you could do
something about all of this.

56:20.250 --> 56:21.080
You know you me.

56:26.490 --> 56:29.100
- Not everything can be repaired.

56:31.230 --> 56:32.060
- I know.

56:34.010 --> 56:34.960
- I've got to go.

57:10.730 --> 57:13.250
- Nicole, What have you been taking?

57:13.250 --> 57:14.490
- Dad-

57:14.490 --> 57:15.330
- What have you been taking?

57:15.330 --> 57:16.160
What have you taken?

57:16.990 --> 57:17.830
I have called the ambulance.

57:18.940 --> 57:20.660
- Give me my phone.

57:20.660 --> 57:21.490
- I just called the ambulance for you.

57:23.540 --> 57:25.190
You need to get some help Nicole.

57:26.550 --> 57:27.800
I'm just looking out for you.

57:33.300 --> 57:34.980
- I'm going to go.

57:34.980 --> 57:36.230
Check on the ambulance.

57:40.930 --> 57:42.430
- I've been there.

57:45.110 --> 57:45.940
I've been there Nicole.

57:47.980 --> 57:49.650
Don't kill yourself.

57:56.850 --> 57:58.180
Let me help you.

58:02.170 --> 58:03.000
Okay.

58:08.190 --> 58:09.690
I have been there.

58:13.230 --> 58:15.390
Okay, listen I have to go.

58:17.230 --> 58:18.480
- No, don't go.

58:23.550 --> 58:25.590
- The next
few weeks were tough.

58:27.030 --> 58:27.860
I wasn't going to rehab.

58:27.860 --> 58:28.700
Not this time.

58:29.670 --> 58:31.920
was a gesture nothing more.

58:31.920 --> 58:33.360
I needed places to get more.

58:34.670 --> 58:36.540
Sometimes I did get more.

58:36.540 --> 58:39.770
Data for counselors and
doctors Frankie gave me

58:39.770 --> 58:42.020
the helping hand and
the shoulders to cry on.

58:49.520 --> 58:52.120
To my father, my addictions
were an embarrassment.

58:53.400 --> 58:55.580
To Frankie they were
a problem to be fixed.

58:57.210 --> 58:58.960
Neither of them totally understood.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.590
At least

59:02.590 --> 59:04.140
- The script that got me fixed.

59:06.890 --> 59:09.340
Tried maybe one of our cronies.

59:12.810 --> 59:14.000
Serious Nicole.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.300
That's what you got right.

59:18.030 --> 59:21.130
Snuck a voice that just
comes in your head.

59:23.370 --> 59:24.660
- Well, I've been getting help for that

59:24.660 --> 59:25.770
from my online group.

59:28.850 --> 59:33.400
their advice
is not anything I have known

59:33.400 --> 59:34.230
before.

59:35.170 --> 59:37.350
- It doesn't mean it's
not going to work Nicole.

59:39.270 --> 59:44.270
. No, I have no easy answers for you.

59:45.720 --> 59:50.720
Look at me, all I could
do is just be your friend.

59:59.490 --> 01:00:01.540
- What did you do when the lights came on

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:04.990
- Build things.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.590
- Sometimes weeks had passed
where I wouldn't go to him

01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:38.420
at all.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.220
We didn't always talk.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:45.110
He helped me by just being.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:48.910
Just to me

01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:58.690
- Yeah it is fine.

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:01.520
They are my friends.

01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:15.910
Right,

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:16.740
- Hey

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:22.140
- Listen I'm sorry about before.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:24.570
I wasn't really thinking straight.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.450
The way I see it if we start
stealing from each other

01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:30.450
we're screwed right?

01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:33.920
The world has taken
enough from us as it is.

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:36.170
That's no excuse.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.280
You gave my toss back.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.110
we are good.

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:43.460
- Allright.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:46.310
I'm PJ.

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:49.260
- Frankie.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.990
- They already see us as thieves.

01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:58.260
So different tools.

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:02.600
Other than a few missed bills
away from being right here.

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:10.220
- PJ you haven't been
homeless long have you?

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.690
- If you told me two years
ago that I was going to end up

01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:20.970
living like this I would
have laughed in your face.

01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:24.840
I had my own bar, believe it or not,

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.030
fiance, a plan.

01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:34.180
But I was too quiet for too long.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:36.810
Bills kept coming in.

01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:39.550
Wedding was delayed

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:46.940
I was bankrupt.

01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:50.570
I was alone.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.100
Don't take much for everything to unravel.

01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:57.510
- Just takes one thing, right.

01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:01.070
- So what happened to you?

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:03.970
Just one thing?

01:03:07.610 --> 01:03:09.000
- No.

01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:19.290
Hey another word.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.860
- Chico's over there.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.520
Hey.

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.260
- All right.

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:49.930
- Hello.

01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:50.790
- Hey, Miss Nicole.

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.060
- Hello.

01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.190
- How are you feeling?

01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:55.520
- Feeling okay.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.660
- How are you doing?

01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:57.680
- Good.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.500
- Chico can I ask you something?

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.220
What if

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:05.320
you walked away from your life.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.310
- I don't like to talk about that.

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:19.800
- Okay, I'm sorry.

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.320
- Don't ask me.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.850
Heavy burdens Miss Nicole.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:33.420
Heavier than the weight
of the world on your back.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.940
around your neck.

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:46.240
I wasn't always on the streets.

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.960
I had a life,

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:56.290
a family.

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:00.730
- The green ones are my favorite.

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:03.450
- Allright, they are
your dad's favorite too.

01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:15.440
- Ho ho ho, merry Christmas.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:16.270
- Daddy.

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.080
- Hi, pumpkin.

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:22.670
Hello.

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:25.180
Are you all right.

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.490
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:27.320
How are you?

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:28.810
How is it out there?

01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:30.230
- Terrible.

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:31.370
It's madness.

01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:33.110
I'm not even kidding.

01:05:33.110 --> 01:05:34.110
I mean

01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:35.630
literally people are mad.

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:37.150
Traffic, that's awful.

01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:39.170
But this tree is fantastic.

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:40.170
- Thank you.

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:41.000
- We did a good job, didn't we?

01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:43.570
- I think so?

01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:44.750
- Mm- hmm-

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:46.290
- I think you couldn't
have done it by yourself.

01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:47.120
I'd say that we've got a
pretty good helper there.

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:49.810
And it was cold outside.

01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:51.750
You know what's worse?

01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:53.310
Crowds.

01:05:53.310 --> 01:05:54.140
- Yeah.

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:55.330
- Mayhem

01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:05.190
- Daddy would forget his
head if it wasn't attached

01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:07.780
to his body.

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:10.740
I've already been out
the shops quite a bit,

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:15.630
getting things we don't
need like wrapping paper...

01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:16.630
Who wraps gifts?

01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:17.980
- Santa and his howls.

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:18.810
- Santa!

01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:21.700
- Yeah, me too.

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:22.530
- Bye daddy.

01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:26.820
Get some sleep.

01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:32.980
- Sweet dreams.

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.270
- Don't get too long.

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:36.270
- I won't.

01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:37.290
I love you.

01:06:37.290 --> 01:06:38.370
- I love you.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.270
- Merry Christmas

01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:42.770
- Merry Christmas.

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:51.030
- We are finished.

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:55.000
Yes, good girl.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.010
Dad

01:06:57.010 --> 01:06:58.010
- Yeah,

01:06:58.010 --> 01:06:58.840
fire brigade.

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:01.960
There's a house it's
completely up in smoke.

01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:05.810
Three people I think.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.170
- Stop.

01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:37.110
- Beautiful wife.

01:07:44.730 --> 01:07:46.730
An angel for a daughter.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.140
I don't have them anymore.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.150
They're gone.

01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:08.590
So after that, I didn't want
to live this life anymore.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.939
I wanted to take myself
out of the equation.

01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:21.120
Just didn't make sense to be here.

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:23.970
I don't know.

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:28.020
I might have been looking
for some reason to stay.

01:08:30.979 --> 01:08:32.720
One day I found it.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:33.960
Several years ago.

01:08:36.609 --> 01:08:38.830
I was squatting at this
place where I would

01:08:40.069 --> 01:08:44.720
do some bad things.

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:47.029
Are you doing all right?

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.160
- Oh shit, Chico.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.319
Bloody mate.

01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:51.819
- What?

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:55.710
- You are shitting me, right?

01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:56.910
You live in here?

01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:57.740
- No.

01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:59.920
- You did a good job.

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:13.010
- Come on Chico, I

01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:15.200
Come on, I want some things.

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:19.210
- There was a little boy there.

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:06.090
- Frankie?

01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:09.660
Did I hear you say Frankie?

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:14.690
- No.

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:16.280
I didn't save him Miss Nicole.

01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:19.970
I had some training.

01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:22.320
I actually did what I could, I tried out.

01:11:23.690 --> 01:11:24.910
I didn't know what I was doing.

01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:26.250
I was scared.

01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:28.070
Frankie saved himself

01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:29.390
- No, Chico you saved him.

01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:30.220
- No.

01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:32.490
- Yes.

01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:34.160
His strength to survive
is what saved Frankie.

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.330
He is such a bright light.

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:41.530
- Yeah, he is.

01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:45.390
- Well after.

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:53.540
We got together, we bonded.

01:11:58.170 --> 01:11:59.770
We were in the streets together.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:07.440
He makes these contraptions
he invents these crazy things

01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:09.950
that people love off the streets.

01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:12.730
I mean they're fantastic.

01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:15.570
Really and I sell them
I got the gift of gab,

01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:20.080
And that's how we

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.400
make our money and get by.

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:30.280
It isn't a bad life.

01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:37.550
- Frankie.

01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:44.990
He had nothing

01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.830
Nothing.

01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:50.610
He was on the streets and on the run.

01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:55.610
Me I started using because I was rich.

01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:02.940
And spoilt.

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:04.260
And I hate my dad.

01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:08.500
Coming
here was a big mistake.

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:11.670
- No Miss Nicole, don't do that.

01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:13.460
- You've been through so much Chico.

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.500
You can't keep running from yourself.

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:22.500
Funny thing that you're
always with yourself.

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:26.190
- Chico, some people live in such shit.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.190
And some people live without a care.

01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:34.890
This all just feels so damn wrong.

01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:38.210
I'm exploiting you.

01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:39.100
You shouldn't be helping me.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.040
- Nicole?

01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.470
- Yeah.

01:13:59.470 --> 01:14:00.470
- Where are you going?

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:01.890
- I just need to be alone
for a while Frankie.

01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:04.060
- Let me help you.

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:05.960
- I just need to help myself.

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:08.470
Wait, I got you

01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:11.130
something

01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:13.920
Early birthday present.

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:17.010
I'm getting good, huh?

01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:25.150
Meet me at the bridge in an hour.

01:14:25.150 --> 01:14:26.160
- Okay.

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:00.670
Hey

01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:01.500
- Hi mate.

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.330
- Yeah.

01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:03.170
- what can I get you?

01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:04.350
- Can you get me Gavin?

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:08.100
Give this to him

01:15:10.670 --> 01:15:12.820
- He passed away a few days ago mate.

01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:14.700
I'm sorry.

01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:19.160
- Of what?

01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:21.100
- Pneumonia.

01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:28.220
He always liked cards.

01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:06.280
- Frankie.

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.420
It's your mum's new address.

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.590
Frankie, I haven't seen her for 10 years.

01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:28.810
- Thank you.

01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:56.770
Hey bro.

01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:02.760
- You just fuck off allright?

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.320
Just get on, just fuck off.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.760
- I'm just a friend.

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:13.400
Same situation as you,
you can't stay here.

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.520
- I don't give a shit.

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.790
You just leave me alone yeah.

01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:18.410
- Do you want to go to a
safe place man, come on

01:17:20.370 --> 01:17:21.200
You can trust me man.

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:24.450
- Why the fuck should I trust you, huh?

01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:30.710
Just leave me alone, just fuck off.

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:39.520
Help me, wait come
here, this is my friend.

01:17:41.130 --> 01:17:42.710
- Is she all right?

01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:25.470
- Viv, what happened?

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:34.810
- I thought you guys were friends.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.710
- Friends?

01:18:36.710 --> 01:18:38.630
Friends is what you have or not me.

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.040
- Where's Ryan, Viv?

01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:51.190
Where's he?

01:18:57.470 --> 01:19:01.470
- Frankie,
on time but I'm so sorry.

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:10.120
- It's okay.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.430
It's okay.

01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:07.390
Please, come, on.

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:13.590
- What the fuck.

01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:15.090
Get the fuck off me.

01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:16.150
- Grab him.

01:20:16.150 --> 01:20:17.310
- Just fuck you.

01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:18.550
- Grab him.

01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:21.790
- Fuck you, I'm going to fucking kill you.

01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:22.790
- I got it.

01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:23.880
- Get off me.

01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:27.030
- What are you doing?

01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:28.780
- You deserve worse than this fucker.

01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:32.150
- Fuck, I will fucking kill you.

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:34.980
Go, Frankie go, go.

01:20:36.530 --> 01:20:38.030
- You fucking pig.

01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:49.010
- Thanks, allright?

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:51.570
- Is that all you have for your hat?

01:20:51.570 --> 01:20:54.450
- That's okay, you can give me
more when you make a fortune

01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:55.600
some day.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.060
- Deal.

01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:59.960
- I want a big house a hot tub
and my own recording studio.

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.090
- Recording studio?

01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:02.220
- Yeah.

01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:06.730
It's not what goes to them, isn't it?

01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:11.620
Beg, sing, sell magazines
and they just walk straight

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:12.450
past us.

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.770
- Don't forget about the ones
that speed up when they notice

01:21:16.770 --> 01:21:17.600
you.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:21.120
They look at absolutely anything
in the street as long as

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.770
they don't have to look your way.

01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:28.510
- I think it's easy for them.

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:33.960
To pretend to themselves
that they just don't see us.

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:36.580
- When they look at us they feel guilt.

01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:37.880
Nobody likes to feel guilt

01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:42.730
- I suppose.

01:21:42.730 --> 01:21:44.120
I felt like they need to help
us and everyone has their own

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.750
problems I guess.

01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:48.170
So it's easy to blank us and just move on.

01:21:51.070 --> 01:21:56.070
- Sometimes part of me wants to hate them.

01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:02.400
Walk right up to them and
yell until they can ignore me

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.230
anymore.

01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:09.440
It's the kind of thoughts
that make you sick.

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:12.090
So instead of yelling I sing.

01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:17.510
I sing and every once in a
while someone tosses me a coin.

01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:28.150
- I did something bad.

01:22:28.150 --> 01:22:28.980
A long time ago.

01:22:31.670 --> 01:22:35.430
Every time people ignore
us it feels like judgment.

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.540
- I could just trade one
prison for another, right?

01:22:48.710 --> 01:22:49.550
The attitude to you doesn't define you.

01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:52.580
You do and then the only
person you can answer to is

01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:53.530
yourself, allright.

01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:57.380
If you've done right by
the people you care about,

01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:58.650
you will know it.

01:22:58.650 --> 01:23:00.450
If you haven't you'll know that too.

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.360
So if you feel like you're being judged

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:06.410
it is is because you're judging yourself.

01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:20.200
It's your life.

01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:24.750
maybe it's time you face
what you've been hiding from.

01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:25.140
- What are you fucking looking at?

01:24:27.550 --> 01:24:31.100
I said what do you fucking looking at?

01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:35.480
- Nothing I'm sorry.

01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:40.650
- So what do you want then?

01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:43.360
A punch?

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.190
Money?

01:24:47.010 --> 01:24:48.660
Because I haven't got no money.

01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:49.490
- I'm sorry.

01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:52.210
- Where's my manners?

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:56.090
- Come on have a drink.

01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:58.340
- I'm good.

01:24:58.340 --> 01:24:59.420
Thanks.

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:01.540
- Do you think you're better than me?

01:25:03.230 --> 01:25:04.590
You are going to fucking drink it.

01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:05.790
- Why don't you just go.

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:13.970
- I swear, on your life, if
you don't fucking drink it.

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:19.410
I want to fucking

01:25:19.410 --> 01:25:21.430
- Why don't you just leave me alone?

01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:22.260
- Yeah.

01:25:23.130 --> 01:25:24.430
- Drink the fucking drink.

01:25:28.150 --> 01:25:29.310
- You bastard,

01:25:30.650 --> 01:25:33.560
You fucking bastard, I'm a veteran.

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:38.170
And I fought for this country.

01:25:38.170 --> 01:25:39.810
- Yeah.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:44.150
- So what's your point?

01:25:44.150 --> 01:25:44.980
Soldier.

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:48.590
- That I deserve-

01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:52.930
- What, deserve what?

01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:56.030
Look at you.

01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:58.560
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:02.150
You dirty, filthy

01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:07.870
So come on then soldier.

01:26:09.310 --> 01:26:10.400
Come on then.

01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:26.230
You fucking, dirty, filthy

01:26:26.230 --> 01:26:27.330
- Wait, what are you doing?

01:26:27.330 --> 01:26:28.330
Leave him alone man.

01:26:29.170 --> 01:26:30.580
- Now what are you, I'm
going to have to punch you.

01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:32.870
What are you going to do?

01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:33.950
- I hate you.

01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:36.290
You're a mess.

01:26:36.290 --> 01:26:39.970
- Look at you, you are a
waste, you are a drunk.

01:26:39.970 --> 01:26:41.260
You know what, I wonder whether
one day, you don't end up

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:43.930
like one of us.

01:27:02.370 --> 01:27:05.060
- The boy has become a man.

01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:08.250
And the man has become a

01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:14.250
- Allright.

01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:22.450
You haven't told me about this.

01:27:22.450 --> 01:27:24.570
- No

01:27:24.570 --> 01:27:25.900
- Good.

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:29.340
I've got some good news on-

01:27:30.170 --> 01:27:31.260
- I found my mom's new address.

01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:32.770
- What's the bad news?

01:27:39.850 --> 01:27:43.460
- Chico, I found my mom.

01:27:50.730 --> 01:27:53.790
Nicole, she's found my mom's new address.

01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:59.260
I think it's time for me to go home.

01:28:11.150 --> 01:28:16.150
I wanted to ask you, would
you like to come with me?

01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:47.100
- Well, from we hit the
open road, my advice

01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:48.430
to you is pack right.

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:50.560
Sleep fast.

01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:52.430
Goodnight Frankie.

01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:54.500
- Allright.

01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:23.580
Probably don't understand
a word what I'm saying.

01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.950
- My English is pretty great.

01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:26.780
Thank you.

01:29:28.410 --> 01:29:29.240
- Sorry.

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:32.310
- I've watched you these past days.

01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:33.550
A lot is on your mind.

01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:35.410
- Yeah.

01:29:37.230 --> 01:29:39.380
I stopped a bad man
from hurting my friend.

01:29:44.450 --> 01:29:45.400
And I'm going home.

01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:48.790
- Where is home for you?

01:29:50.230 --> 01:29:51.330
- I don't know.

01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:54.530
It's a house that I've never seen before.

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.230
- You're weird.

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.240
- You're not the first to tell me that.

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:07.190
What about you?

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:10.760
- I was from

01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:11.590
Romania.

01:30:15.170 --> 01:30:16.170
- Come here.

01:30:40.710 --> 01:30:41.770
- What are you all about?

01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:42.780
It's my turn.

01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:51.790
- Yes.

01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:53.920
Very wrong.

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.430
Now you tell me a bad English word.

01:30:57.650 --> 01:31:00.470
- Arse hole.

01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:01.420
- Like arse hole.

01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:02.370
- Arse hole.

01:31:02.370 --> 01:31:03.340
You, arse hole.

01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:04.290
- Yeah.

01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:07.460
- I want to know every English insult.

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:11.600
- Idiot.

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:13.580
- Idiot.

01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:14.850
- Like idiot.

01:31:14.850 --> 01:31:15.680
- Idiot.

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.000
- Dickhead.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.320
- You are a dickhead.

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:39.470
- It's my turn.

01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:42.610
- What are you on the about?

01:31:42.610 --> 01:31:43.530
It's my turn.

01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:45.710
- I'm not playing.

01:31:45.710 --> 01:31:48.210
- James stop playing, you
are always cheating man.

01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:53.140
- We didn't even have
enough money for food.

01:31:55.090 --> 01:31:57.030
He wanted me to do things for money.

01:31:59.790 --> 01:32:00.620
- Sorry.

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:03.470
I don't want to say.

01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:05.370
- Well, I knew what to say to him.

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:07.800
Go to your home Frankie.

01:32:09.170 --> 01:32:11.060
Then go to see your friend, the lady.

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:15.130
- Enough about helping her.

01:32:18.670 --> 01:32:19.500
Just be there.

01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:40.750
- I'm sorry.

01:32:55.630 --> 01:32:56.630
- It's okay.

01:33:12.370 --> 01:33:13.540
- Rise and shine.

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:17.400
Let's go Lover boy

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:18.450
burning daylight.

01:33:19.290 --> 01:33:20.120
Road trip.

01:33:30.170 --> 01:33:31.000
- What's wrong?

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.180
- This is silly this.

01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:36.630
Sadly I haven't seen my
mom in a long time Chico.

01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:42.400
- Well, it's a little late
now Frankie and me were pretty

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:44.190
long ways up the road.

01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:49.980
- Look, Frankie.

01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:56.380
If I would give anything.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.970
For the chance to go home.

01:34:10.930 --> 01:34:15.340
Still, I can see why
you're a little hesitant

01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:17.140
about leaving after last night.

01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:24.250
She's pretty cute.

01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:30.400
- We are just friends nothing happened.

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:34.060
- Friend?

01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:37.390
Mate, that's what you said about Nicole.

01:34:40.050 --> 01:34:41.550
We passed the threshold.

01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:43.200
- You think so-

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:44.450
- Frankie Moore.

01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:48.710
You sold me out man.

01:34:48.710 --> 01:34:49.710
It's on you.

01:34:56.670 --> 01:34:57.500
- Promise me.

01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:01.820
Honestly, I just wanted to
leave this message just to let

01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:04.120
you don't need to worry.

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:06.730
We've been planning this
party for the last two months.

01:35:06.730 --> 01:35:09.110
Honestly, everybody's
put so much effort in.

01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:10.310
Everyone's going to be there.

01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:11.910
It's not going to be a big deal.

01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:12.740
It's just...

01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:20.890
It will be all right.

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:22.720
Okay just...

01:35:26.210 --> 01:35:27.690
Shit.

01:36:03.230 --> 01:36:05.230
- You promised me you is
going to come see my mom?

01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:08.010
- I know I did, Frankie.

01:36:08.010 --> 01:36:09.080
I'm sorry,

01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:12.410
Sometimes life flips the script on you.

01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:16.590
I wanted to introduce

01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:17.840
And I knew that's my mom.

01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:20.560
- I know Frank.

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:22.820
I wanted that too.

01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:29.740
We had our ride and listen,
we couldn't have done

01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:30.840
it with anyone better.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:35.010
You are such a bright
light Franklin just keep

01:36:35.010 --> 01:36:36.370
shining on this won't we?

01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:42.360
You go and see your mom.

01:38:18.650 --> 01:38:19.480
- Hello.

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:29.880
- Mom it's me.

01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:33.260
Frankie.

01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:49.330
- Are you okay?

01:40:49.330 --> 01:40:50.730
- Yeah.

01:40:50.730 --> 01:40:51.560
Yes mom.

01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:55.780
- Need some toast?

01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:57.870
- Yeah, sure.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:24.970
- 11 years, Frankie

01:41:28.010 --> 01:41:28.840
11 years.

01:41:36.710 --> 01:41:37.540
- Mom,

01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:43.210
I always said I was going to come.

01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:50.170
After what happened for you to hate me.

01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:51.080
- Hate you?

01:41:51.930 --> 01:41:53.080
I could never hate you.

01:41:55.470 --> 01:41:58.200
I called the police that night
because I want you to found.

01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.100
I wanted you safe.

01:42:05.970 --> 01:42:06.800
Come sit down.

01:42:39.190 --> 01:42:41.560
Do you know what I think every day?

01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:44.360
is he alive today?

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:48.630
Will it be alive tomorrow?

01:42:48.630 --> 01:42:51.520
I kept on thinking you're going
to walk through that door.

01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:56.970
I even stayed in that opera
house because I thought you'd

01:42:56.970 --> 01:42:57.920
come home.

01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:06.260
Your dad's death did not have
to be the end of your life

01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:07.090
Frankie.

01:43:16.570 --> 01:43:17.470
Okay.

01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:18.310
So the way to see

01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:23.860
Just wanted to know if you were okay.

01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:37.630
Oh, God, Frankie, what
else have you been through?

01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:50.200
- It doesn't matter.

01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:01.540
Mom, this is really hot.

01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:03.040
- Okay, I'm sorry.

01:47:56.740 --> 01:47:58.230
Frankie Moore was a young boy

01:47:58.230 --> 01:48:01.220
who brutally killed his father
and fled to the streets.

01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:05.590
That was the only story
most people ever heard.

01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:09.010
But for those of us who knew
him, it was a different story.

01:48:09.010 --> 01:48:11.760
We knew a guy who'd always
tried to make things better.

Today, his story ends

01:48:20.670 --> 01:48:22.580
