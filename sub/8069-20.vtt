00:03.871 --> 00:07.741
[theme music]

01:00.128 --> 01:02.630
Mom, who invented the iron?

01:02.663 --> 01:03.864
I don't know.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.166
Probably some man.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.900
Actually, that's not true.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.236
It was invented by a woman--

01:08.269 --> 01:11.205
Yolanda I-ron.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.241
I believe she was a
Romanian determined

01:13.274 --> 01:15.576
to drive the crease problem
out of Central Europe.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.877
What happened to her?

01:16.910 --> 01:19.313
She was killed.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.548
Where are you going?

01:20.581 --> 01:21.449
DAN: Budget Club.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.416
Yeah, can I come?

01:22.450 --> 01:23.751
I'm taking the Harley.

01:23.784 --> 01:24.985
You can't carry
nothing on that.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.187
I'm just going
for small stuff,

01:26.220 --> 01:27.087
you know, like batteries.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.322
Well, fine.

01:28.356 --> 01:29.757
I have friends of my own.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.292
I'll just go out
by myself later.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.860
Why don't you just call
Jackie and straighten

01:32.893 --> 01:33.761
this whole thing out?

01:33.794 --> 01:35.929
No!

01:35.963 --> 01:39.467
Besides, I did, and
she won't talk to me.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.969
Mom, I think this
belongs to Aunt Jackie.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.104
Well, put it in the box.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.439
Are you guys
still not talking?

01:45.473 --> 01:47.775
I guess so.

01:47.808 --> 01:50.544
Boy, you must have really
messed up this time, Mom.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.746
Hey, Becky, you know,
sometimes you and your sister

01:52.780 --> 01:55.216
get mad at each other, not
for anything in particular.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.418
Just, you know, one of you
will do some really stupid.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.786
The next thing you
know, you're fighting.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.355
Or not even something
stupid, just, you

02:01.389 --> 02:03.324
know, something that was none
of your mother's business--

02:03.357 --> 02:06.093
your sister's business.

02:06.126 --> 02:06.994
Bye, Dan.

02:07.027 --> 02:07.828
See you.

02:09.897 --> 02:10.831
So what you gonna do today?

02:10.864 --> 02:12.466
You gonna play with Diane?

02:12.500 --> 02:13.734
We're going to the mall, mom.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.035
That's cool.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.604
I'll drive you down there,
and then I'll just come in,

02:16.637 --> 02:19.440
you know, look around.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.941
Mom, you're becoming a leech.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.447
Why don't you
just call Crystal?

02:26.480 --> 02:28.081
Yeah, play with
someone your own age.

02:28.115 --> 02:30.684
[phone ringing]

02:31.885 --> 02:35.088
Hi, you've reached
the Conner party line.

02:35.122 --> 02:36.890
If you weren't still
fighting with Aunt Jackie,

02:36.924 --> 02:38.859
you wouldn't have to be hanging
out with Crystal every day.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.028
Well, that isn't it
true, and one thing has

02:41.061 --> 02:43.197
nothing to do with the other.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.199
I have just as much
fun with Chrystal

02:45.233 --> 02:48.168
as I ever did with
your Aunt Jackie.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.303
Mom, it's Crystal.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.671
She wants to know what
time your coming over

02:50.704 --> 02:51.739
to help organize her plates.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.047
GARY: Hey, did
you, um-- you know,

03:00.080 --> 03:05.018
I know it's none of my business,
but did you talk to your sister

03:05.052 --> 03:06.754
yet?
- No.

03:06.787 --> 03:07.655
Oh, come on, Jackie.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.556
It's been three weeks.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.190
I mean, I feel really bad.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.625
Some of this is my fault.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.661
No, it's not your fault, Gar.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.595
It's no big deal, really.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.297
Sometimes we don't talk at all.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.731
OK, you don't want
to deal with it.

03:17.765 --> 03:18.799
That's OK.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.568
But you know, my brother
and I don't speak.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.035
We never write.
We never visit.

03:22.069 --> 03:22.936
Nothing.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.072
And I think that's pretty sad.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.741
Oh, that is sad.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.209
You should at least write.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.512
We're not talking
about me, Jackie.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.580
Can we?

03:32.613 --> 03:36.584
Just let me say one thing.

03:36.617 --> 03:41.555
I think that it is very sad that
two sisters, two good friends

03:41.589 --> 03:43.757
that are living
in the same city,

03:43.791 --> 03:46.627
aren't even speaking to each
other, especially when I'm

03:46.660 --> 03:48.296
in love with one of them.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.464
Oh!

03:50.498 --> 03:53.267
I thought maybe we could
do some special today.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.935
OK, what?

03:54.968 --> 03:57.237
Oh, hold that thought.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.575
Hey, Jackie.
Hey.

04:01.609 --> 04:02.543
Hey, Dan.
How you doing?

04:02.576 --> 04:04.278
- Hi, Dan.
- What are you doing here?

04:04.312 --> 04:05.946
Oh, I've just come by
to see my sister-in-law.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.481
Is that so unusual?

04:07.515 --> 04:11.452
Well, it's just that you
never did it before, that's all.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.353
Well, I have now.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.354
Yeah, great.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.254
DAN: Yeah.

04:14.288 --> 04:15.356
Good.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.825
So how's the job?

04:17.858 --> 04:19.727
The kids?

04:19.760 --> 04:20.961
My sister?
- Fine.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.330
Everybody's fine.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.798
Listen, I just want to, you
know-- uh, you got company so--

04:24.832 --> 04:26.166
No, what?

04:26.199 --> 04:27.801
Well, you know, I
haven't seen you around.

04:27.835 --> 04:31.339
I just wanted to say hi.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.441
Hi.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.242
- Dan.
- Can you talk?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.877
JACKIE: Yeah.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.346
Hey, Gar, this is
just family stuff.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.246
I'll only be a minute.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.981
Yeah, No problem.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.516
You want to go in the bedroom?
DAN: Yeah.

04:42.550 --> 04:43.417
Yeah.

04:43.451 --> 04:47.054
Uh, listen, I-- you know--

04:47.087 --> 04:48.422
Uh, listen.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.324
Jackie, I think I'm going to
take a walk down to the corner.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.224
You need anything?

04:51.258 --> 04:52.125
No, Gar.

04:52.159 --> 04:53.060
No.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.227
No, we'll just be a second.

04:54.261 --> 04:56.129
You don't have to go.
No.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.298
Dan, tell him.
He doesn't have to go.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.467
I'd kill for a root beer.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.802
Great.

05:01.835 --> 05:02.770
I'll see you later.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.608
OK, what?

05:07.641 --> 05:10.644
All right, let
me say first of all

05:10.678 --> 05:13.080
that I never poked my nose
into your business, correct?

05:13.113 --> 05:14.448
Correct.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.116
And up till 10 minutes ago,
I never thought I ever would.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.651
And I appreciate that, Dan.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.886
You're welcome.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.488
But Roseanne, as we all
know, does poke her nose in.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.422
Uh-huh.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.591
But we also know
that if she ever

05:23.624 --> 05:26.326
thought that anything
she ever did hurt you,

05:26.360 --> 05:28.261
it would tear her up.

05:28.295 --> 05:29.530
Yeah.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.065
You're one of the most
important people in her life.

05:32.099 --> 05:37.505
And right now she's sitting at
home, hanging out with Crystal,

05:37.538 --> 05:39.172
trying to act like
everything's OK.

05:39.206 --> 05:41.409
But everything's not OK.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.342
That's OK with me.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.844
Well, it's not
OK with Roseanne.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.413
She's hurting.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.214
You not talking to her
is really hurting her.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.115
She's tough.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.016
She'll get over it.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.651
She needs you, Jackie.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.553
You shutting her out
like this is too much.

05:52.586 --> 05:53.454
You got to call her.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.822
- No, I can't.
- Come on.

05:54.855 --> 05:55.756
I'm asking you.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.558
Dan, so I'm just
supposed to let

05:57.591 --> 05:59.960
her treat me like the kid sister
for the whole rest of my life?

05:59.993 --> 06:01.094
No, no.
You're absolutely right.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.663
You're not a kid anymore.
- That's right, Dan.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.731
That's right.
And maybe she'll learn.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.132
Maybe next time
she'll think before

06:05.165 --> 06:06.667
she opens her big, fat mouth.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.503
Hey, Jackie, that's
the way Roseanne is.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.604
Now come on.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.305
I'm asking you to be
the big sister, here.

06:12.339 --> 06:15.443
Dan, it hurts
me too, you know?

06:15.476 --> 06:17.044
You think I like not
talking my own sister?

06:17.077 --> 06:17.945
I don't like it either.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.548
But she started it.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.422
That's the maturity
I was looking for.

06:28.456 --> 06:29.823
Well, Roseanne
and I will just have

06:29.857 --> 06:31.024
to work it out on our own--
DAN: Yeah, well--

06:31.058 --> 06:31.925
JACKIE: -- you know, Dan?

06:31.959 --> 06:32.960
DAN: -- I took a shot.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.428
Thanks for stopping by.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.234
Well, I--

06:41.268 --> 06:44.271
I didn't mean to do
anything, you know.

06:44.304 --> 06:47.074
It's just Jackie-- she's always
screwing up every relationship

06:47.107 --> 06:48.408
with every guy, you know?

06:48.442 --> 06:51.812
And I thought maybe if I pointed
out to her stupid behavior

06:51.845 --> 06:54.982
before she made a total
ass out of herself

06:55.015 --> 06:56.584
that maybe she wouldn't do it.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.620
So basically, you stuck your
nose in where it didn't belong.

06:59.653 --> 07:00.721
Yeah.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.756
But you did it with
the best of intentions.

07:02.790 --> 07:03.724
Yeah.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.858
And you never
thought for a moment

07:04.892 --> 07:06.393
that it might hurt Jackie.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.529
No, of course not.

07:08.562 --> 07:11.799
Well, now, she's your sister.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.867
And I hesitate to say
anything bad about Jackie.

07:13.901 --> 07:14.768
No.

07:14.802 --> 07:15.669
No.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.404
Go ahead.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.908
Well, if I had a sister
who loved me enough to risk

07:20.941 --> 07:24.077
sticking her neck out by saying
something that might make

07:24.111 --> 07:26.046
a difference in a
meaningful relationship

07:26.079 --> 07:31.519
with a handsome, sexy,
independently employed guy who

07:31.552 --> 07:34.321
lives right down the street
from yours truly, well,

07:34.354 --> 07:36.156
I'd be nothing but grateful.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.024
Really?

07:37.057 --> 07:38.225
Well, of course, Roseanne.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.327
What you did, you did
out of love and caring.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.530
And Jackie knows you well enough
to know that sometimes you

07:42.563 --> 07:45.398
do stupid and insensitive
things but with the best

07:45.432 --> 07:48.001
of intentions.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.703
Gee, thanks, Crystal.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.572
Well, and if she
can't see that,

07:51.605 --> 07:53.440
well, then she's just
as nasty as can be.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.441
And you should tell her.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.210
Well, she won't
even talk to me.

07:57.244 --> 08:00.648
Well-- well, that's the
stupidest thing I ever heard.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.916
You-- you get Jackie
on the phone right now,

08:02.950 --> 08:05.052
and you tell her that that's
not the way sisters are

08:05.085 --> 08:06.754
supposed to treat one another.

08:06.787 --> 08:07.655
Yeah.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.189
CRYSTAL: Mhm.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.090
Yeah.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.892
CRYSTAL: Mhm.
- That's-- I am.

08:11.925 --> 08:12.993
I'm going to call
her up right now.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.998
I'm going to tell her that
she should just get over it.

08:18.031 --> 08:18.832
That's right.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.739
Jackie, hi, it's me.

08:25.773 --> 08:26.640
Oh, that's good.

08:26.674 --> 08:27.474
Good.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.612
Yeah.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.146
Yeah, well, I think
we need to talk.

08:35.849 --> 08:36.650
Yeah.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.623
Well, we both.

08:42.656 --> 08:43.624
Yeah.

08:43.657 --> 08:44.457
Yeah.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.528
OK.

08:48.562 --> 08:49.763
Great.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.399
Bye.

08:52.432 --> 08:53.300
Well?

08:53.333 --> 08:54.602
She's coming right over.

08:54.635 --> 08:55.502
You see?

08:55.535 --> 08:56.369
She knows she's wrong.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.241
JACKIE: Oh.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.943
GARY: Oh, jeez, I'm back.
- I know.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.177
You're back, but
I got to go now.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.278
Oh, no, wait a minute.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.880
Um, you and I have to
have a little talk.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.515
Well, no, Gary, we can
talk later, because see,

09:08.548 --> 09:10.117
I told Roseanne I'd come
over and talk to her.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.184
- Oh, that's great.
- I know.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.586
But that can wait
just another 10 minutes.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.621
No, Honey, really.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.154
I don't want to put
it off any longer.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.055
Gary.

09:15.088 --> 09:15.989
Gary.

09:16.023 --> 09:16.957
OK.

09:16.990 --> 09:21.895
Now-- OK.

09:21.929 --> 09:26.566
Now, um, boy, I'm in
love with you Jackie.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.702
And, um, you're in love with me.

09:28.736 --> 09:29.737
You're absolutely right.

09:29.770 --> 09:30.938
And I'm glad we talked about it.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.239
Do you feel better?
I know I do.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.440
- Jackie--
- Gary, I really got to go.

09:33.473 --> 09:34.908
You know how important
this is, so you stay here.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.109
Put your feet up.
Have a beer.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.110
Jackie--

09:37.144 --> 09:37.811
And I'll be back
as soon as I can.

09:37.845 --> 09:38.646
Let's get married.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.117
All right.

10:00.533 --> 10:01.669
Becky!

10:01.702 --> 10:02.770
BECKY: What?

10:02.803 --> 10:03.937
ROSEANNE: Get down
here right away.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.505
Quick.
BECKY: What?

10:05.538 --> 10:06.539
OK, your Aunt Jackie's here.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.942
When she comes in,
tell her I'm not here.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.310
BECKY: Why?

10:10.343 --> 10:11.945
Just tell her I was waiting
around for a really long time.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.814
Tell her I got really
mad, and then I left.

10:13.847 --> 10:14.715
Where you going?

10:14.748 --> 10:15.683
I'm going to my bedroom.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.284
I'm not gonna life for you.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.118
I'll do it.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.991
Good, you do it.

10:24.024 --> 10:24.992
Hi.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.226
Jackson, long time no see.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.494
JACKIE: Yeah, I know.

10:27.527 --> 10:28.762
Mom's not here.

10:28.796 --> 10:29.663
She's not?

10:29.697 --> 10:30.664
No.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.499
Well, I got a little hung up.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.835
Yeah, well, she waited
for you for over an hour.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.904
Then she stomped around for
another hour, throwing shoes.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.206
Oh, God, she's mad.

10:39.239 --> 10:42.542
I mean really, really mad.

10:42.575 --> 10:43.811
Wasn't she?

10:43.844 --> 10:45.612
Yeah, I got to go upstairs.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.686
How come her car's here?

10:52.720 --> 10:54.554
Well, because she was
so angry that I told her

10:54.587 --> 10:55.455
she shouldn't drive.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.461
You and Becky doing
some Saturday cleaning?

11:01.494 --> 11:02.863
Yeah.

11:02.896 --> 11:06.566
You know, just trying
to do our share.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.669
You wouldn't be lying
to me, Darlene, would you?

11:09.703 --> 11:10.904
Are you calling me a liar?

11:10.938 --> 11:12.439
Your favorite niece?

11:12.472 --> 11:13.373
I wouldn't go back there.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.574
We haven't cleaned
back there yet.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.009
Really good try, Darlene.

11:16.043 --> 11:16.910
Really good.

11:16.944 --> 11:17.745
Roseanne.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.854
Who is it?

11:26.887 --> 11:28.555
OK, kill me.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.557
Look, I was on my
way over here--

11:30.590 --> 11:31.658
Hey, hey, hey.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.894
If this sentence has
the word "Gary" in it,

11:33.927 --> 11:35.362
I am going to throw
this book at you.

11:35.395 --> 11:39.199
And it's James Michener,
so you better watch out.

11:39.232 --> 11:43.270
I was on my way over here when
the man I am seeing came by--

11:43.303 --> 11:44.938
Oh, and you have to do
everything that he says.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.774
Roseanne, will you stop it?

11:46.807 --> 11:47.941
Stop it?

11:47.975 --> 11:49.509
You're the one going
around saying he's, like,

11:49.542 --> 11:50.978
totally controlling everything.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.245
And then I try to help.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.814
You get all mixed
up and backwards.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.215
You start calling
me the bad guy.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.751
And then you can't even show
up on time to apologize.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.586
I didn't come over
here to apologize to you.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.188
I came over here to forgive you.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.290
Oh, well, sorry.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.858
OK, apology accepted.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.034
So you couldn't, like, pick
up the phone and call me?

12:14.067 --> 12:16.336
No, I was kind of in
the middle of something.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.438
Oh, please spare me.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.040
It's not what you're thinking.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.541
So then you should
have called me?

12:21.574 --> 12:23.443
You want to know
what we were doing?

12:23.476 --> 12:26.880
No, I really don't care
what you and Gary were doing.

12:26.914 --> 12:30.517
Roseanne, he proposed to me.

12:30.550 --> 12:33.520
ALL: [shouting]

12:33.553 --> 12:35.122
I can't believe it!

12:35.155 --> 12:36.523
I want you to get
married in the spring.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.191
Listen, I want you to get
married in our backyard.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.927
We'll move the truck
and the station wagon.

12:44.031 --> 12:46.666
Hey, you come down to the beauty
shop, and they'll do your hair.

12:46.699 --> 12:47.667
Yeah, not that Marcia chick.

12:47.700 --> 12:48.568
Oh no, she's a butcher.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.903
No, no, no.

12:49.937 --> 12:50.804
Iris.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.005
Iris is so good.
- Yeah.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.006
We gotta tell Dan.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.007
And you've got to get a dress.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.375
Hey, I think we should call Mom.

12:55.408 --> 12:56.443
Now, Roseanne, wait.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.344
Hold on a second.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.445
Let's not go so fast.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.412
Now, spring is soon.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.313
I know.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.415
Spring is soon.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.783
Yeah, so?

13:03.817 --> 13:05.052
So I just don't think that
we should dive into anything.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.619
You know, you're the one
telling me I shouldn't be

13:06.653 --> 13:07.620
acting like a high school kid.

13:07.654 --> 13:08.688
Well, what do I know?

13:08.721 --> 13:10.523
Hey, it's your life.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.725
Oh, I know.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.194
But Roseanne, see,
I'm still doing it.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.863
I'm letting him make
all the decisions.

13:15.896 --> 13:16.864
Oh, well that doesn't matter.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.031
You know, even
about the wedding.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.432
I mean, we didn't
even discuss it.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.500
Well, that's no big deal.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.869
So he just said,
let's get married.

13:21.902 --> 13:22.769
Then I just--

13:22.802 --> 13:24.671
I kind of went, all right.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.739
ALL: Ah!

13:26.773 --> 13:28.108
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.109
Oh, God!
I just thought of something.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.610
- What?
- OK.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.145
Jackie Harris.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.981
Jackie Hall.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.082
You will have the--

13:35.115 --> 13:36.583
ALL: Same initials!

13:36.616 --> 13:37.417
Ah!

13:46.126 --> 13:48.428
Roseanne, no.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.596
Come on, Roseanne.

13:49.629 --> 13:52.933
Where are you going
to put a live band?

13:52.966 --> 13:54.201
What if it rains?

13:54.234 --> 13:55.602
A tent?

13:55.635 --> 13:57.871
What kind of a tent?

13:57.905 --> 13:58.771
No.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.140
Roseanne, no.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.909
Well, we haven't
even set a date yet.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.477
And he hasn't met mom and dad.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.378
Where?

14:05.412 --> 14:06.613
No, not this weekend.

14:06.646 --> 14:07.814
No.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.117
Look, let's talk
about it later, OK?

14:10.150 --> 14:11.184
Because Gary's here and--

14:11.218 --> 14:12.085
Hi, Roseanne.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.553
-- we're sort of--

14:13.586 --> 14:14.854
no, we're not doing that.

14:14.888 --> 14:15.755
Jeez.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.357
I'll talk to you later, OK?

14:17.390 --> 14:18.791
Bye.

14:18.825 --> 14:19.626
So?

14:22.495 --> 14:27.434
Gary, there's something I
want to talk to you about.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.868
OK, I'm here.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.870
I brought my ears.

14:30.904 --> 14:33.206
Talk to me.

14:33.240 --> 14:42.382
Gary I'm not the woman that
you've been going out with.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.418
I mean, I'm not this
always agreeable, always

14:45.452 --> 14:48.455
willing to do
whatever you say, gee,

14:48.488 --> 14:53.126
let's have another box
of Dots kind of woman.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.494
Good.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.596
Good what?

14:56.629 --> 14:58.198
Good that you're a
real person and not

14:58.231 --> 14:59.266
Sandy Duncan with a badge.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.167
JACKIE: Yes.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.134
Yeah.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.135
Yeah.

15:02.169 --> 15:04.371
I-- that's-- I'm a
real person, Gary.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.305
I'm not perfect.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.873
Well, I know that.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.508
I mean, who wants to marry
someone who's perfect?

15:08.541 --> 15:10.944
You can never win an
argument with them.

15:10.978 --> 15:14.081
You know, I despise
wearing make up.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.116
And because of you, I've been
wearing it every single day now

15:16.149 --> 15:17.384
for nine weeks.
- What?

15:17.417 --> 15:18.585
Was that because
I came over here

15:18.618 --> 15:19.786
with a shotgun and some blush?

15:19.819 --> 15:20.687
No, I'm just--

15:20.720 --> 15:21.821
I'm telling you, Gary.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.456
There's a whole other
person inside of here

15:23.490 --> 15:26.593
that you don't know
anything about.

15:26.626 --> 15:30.363
I don't like watching
cable sports news.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.798
There.
I've said it.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.400
And if you want to
leave, I don't blame you.

15:36.669 --> 15:39.472
Well, we don't have
to watch cable sports.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.341
I can watch it alone.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.676
Quite frankly, I don't like
watching it with you anyway.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.879
You're annoying.
- OK, fine.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.015
Leave.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.816
That doesn't mean that
I want to leave, Jackie.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.285
That just means that we
don't do everything together.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.754
Gary, I will always say
that I never blamed you.

15:54.787 --> 16:00.060
Jackie, I'm not
going anywhere.

16:00.093 --> 16:03.663
Was that the-- the big thing you
wanted to get off your chest?

16:03.696 --> 16:05.898
Oh, Gary.

16:05.932 --> 16:09.169
Gary, that's just the
tip of the iceberg.

16:09.202 --> 16:18.178
Honey, sometimes at night, I
lay in bed, and bite my nails,

16:18.211 --> 16:19.512
and spit them across the room.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.185
And you know what?

16:25.218 --> 16:26.853
I lie in bed some
nights listening

16:26.886 --> 16:29.856
to you biting your nails and
spitting them across the room.

16:29.889 --> 16:32.325
And I pretend like I'm asleep
so that you can keep doing it.

16:32.359 --> 16:35.162
Look, I've got my sports,
and you've got your nails.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.063
Hmm?

16:36.096 --> 16:38.565
Or you did.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.501
Look, I want to spend
my life with you.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.336
You got a problem with that?

16:43.370 --> 16:45.905
I am also very, very close
with my sister, you know?

16:45.938 --> 16:47.574
We talk on the phone like
three, four times a day.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.109
I got no problem
with that at all.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.310
I think Roseanne's great.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.611
She and I spent an awful
lot of time together.

16:51.644 --> 16:52.745
Fine, I like going over there.

16:52.779 --> 16:53.613
No, you don't.

16:53.646 --> 16:54.581
You're right, Jackie.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.383
I'm lying so you'll marry me.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.188
No, you're not.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.021
Look.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.627
I love you.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.097
I love being a
part of your life.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.132
And so far there is
nothing about your life

17:12.165 --> 17:13.333
that I don't love.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.836
Well, you haven't
met my mother yet.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.805
I'll cross that bridge
when I come to it.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.007
Oh, Honey, you're going to
want to blow up that bridge

17:21.040 --> 17:23.676
when you come to it.

17:23.710 --> 17:24.611
So what do you say?

17:24.644 --> 17:25.412
You want to do
something tonight?

17:25.445 --> 17:26.879
Like
- Yeah, what?

17:26.913 --> 17:28.181
Whatever you want.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.082
You call it.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.918
Well, um, sex.

17:31.951 --> 17:32.819
Good call.

17:32.852 --> 17:33.653
Oh, I got lucky.

17:40.627 --> 17:41.694
DAN: I think your sister's here.

17:41.728 --> 17:42.929
Why?

17:42.962 --> 17:45.398
'Cause her and her beau
just pulled up out in front.

17:45.432 --> 17:48.268
Hey, Dad, can't you see
Aunt Jackie in one of these?

17:48.301 --> 17:49.902
I don't know, Babe.

17:49.936 --> 17:52.372
I think Aunt Jackie's body
might reject a white dress.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.077
Oh, Dan, come on.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.447
There's nothing saying she
can't wear a white dress.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.281
I wore white.

18:14.927 --> 18:19.199
I don't recall asking any
of you for your opinion.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.167
Hi.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.968
ALL: Da da da da--

18:22.001 --> 18:23.903
Cut it out, you guys.
ALL: -- da da da da.

18:23.936 --> 18:24.804
Hi, Deej.

18:24.837 --> 18:25.938
How you doing?

18:25.972 --> 18:26.839
Great.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.107
You gonna have kids?

18:28.141 --> 18:30.843
Well, maybe some someday
when she's very, very old.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.946
Yes, maybe some day, Deej.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.648
OK, everybody get
out of here, because me

18:35.682 --> 18:36.549
and Sis have to talk.

18:36.583 --> 18:37.917
Roseanne.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.686
Well, Gary can go play with Dan.

18:39.719 --> 18:40.887
Yeah, come on out back.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.323
I'll show you my fort.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.324
We'll be in the fort.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.325
Can I come?

18:45.358 --> 18:48.828
GARY: Yeah, come on, Deej.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.830
So it looks like we're
going to have an Uncle Gary.

18:50.863 --> 18:51.864
Yeah, looks like.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.566
Now scram.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.635
Oh, I got bad news.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.904
Well, it's not that bad,
but it's kind of shocking.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.106
OK, I was reading here
in "Farmer's Almanac."

19:00.139 --> 19:03.243
They predict a lot more rain
this spring than normal.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.011
And then, you know,
this tent thing-- that's

19:05.044 --> 19:06.379
really, really expensive.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.080
So I was thinking, maybe we
have to move it in the house.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.282
I don't know.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.483
We should-- I think we may
have to move it inside.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.385
But that's OK, because
oh, it's still going to be

19:12.419 --> 19:13.686
a beautiful, beautiful wedding.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.987
And I have to do
this one thing, and I

19:15.021 --> 19:16.956
need you to help me with it.
- Now, what are you doing?

19:16.989 --> 19:19.659
Well, if we're gonna move
it from outside to inside,

19:19.692 --> 19:21.428
I was thinking about what
I could do to reorganize

19:21.461 --> 19:22.562
everything, you know?

19:22.595 --> 19:23.863
Because it was like a
whole different thing,

19:23.896 --> 19:24.897
and I wasn't planning for it.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.299
So I thought, well,
we could use this.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.334
You come down here.
- No.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.435
No.
No.

19:28.468 --> 19:29.669
- And then you're right here.
- Roseanne.

19:29.702 --> 19:30.370
And then just practice,
like, throwing the bouquet--

19:30.403 --> 19:31.037
No.
No.

19:31.070 --> 19:31.971
No.

19:32.004 --> 19:32.672
Just to see what
it looks like!

19:32.705 --> 19:33.806
No!
Oh, Roseanne.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.675
- Over your shoulder like that.
- Oh, God, no.

19:35.708 --> 19:36.576
I'm not gonna do it.

19:36.609 --> 19:37.844
Oh, just go do it.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.346
I wish you'd slow
down about this.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.447
I am.
I am.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.981
I'm not getting all
excited or anything.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.183
But I was thinking,
I hang some Christmas

19:44.217 --> 19:46.553
lights over the archway there.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.454
Yeah.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.456
ROSEANNE: OK, you're up there.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.324
All the women are down here.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.525
They're going, throw me.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.060
Throw it to me.
Pick me.

19:54.093 --> 19:54.961
I want to catch it.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.229
I want to catch it.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.630
Just throw it, would you?
- Roseanne!

19:57.664 --> 19:58.531
Roseanne!

19:58.565 --> 19:59.532
I want to catch it!

19:59.566 --> 20:01.734
We're not getting married.

20:05.905 --> 20:10.277
I mean, we are but
not just this second.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.311
What happened?

20:11.344 --> 20:12.612
Nothing.

20:12.645 --> 20:15.282
We just decided we needed
to talk about it some more.

20:15.315 --> 20:19.319
Oh, now I'm not going
to have my wedding.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.388
Roseanne, you're married.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.922
This is about me.

20:22.955 --> 20:23.890
Oh, bummer.

20:27.193 --> 20:30.129
See what happened was,
you know, he proposed.

20:30.162 --> 20:31.964
And then I just kind
of said, all right,

20:31.998 --> 20:33.400
which wasn't a definite yes.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.701
It wasn't a no either.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.304
But we just decided we need
to discuss it a lot more.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.305
What did you say?

20:38.338 --> 20:39.306
I mean, how did you handle it?

20:39.339 --> 20:42.542
I think I handled
it really well.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.743
Well, what did you say?

20:43.776 --> 20:46.546
I just was very
straightforward and very adult,

20:46.579 --> 20:48.247
and I said that I
thought we should

20:48.281 --> 20:50.483
take it one step at a time.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.985
Well, how come
you're assertive now?

20:53.019 --> 20:55.221
Basically, we decided
that we would go steady.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.690
And then if that went
well, we would get engaged.

20:57.724 --> 21:04.364
And then eventually, we would
do what you and Dan did.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.965
Well, just say it, Jackie.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.067
Say, me and Gary, we're
going to get married.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.936
Well, we might.
