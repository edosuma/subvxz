12:08.162 --> 12:09.729
but this is not the answer.

12:13.297 --> 12:17.824
So this, this is just...
it's silly.

12:21.871 --> 12:26.049
Sure, well maybe just
for a laugh.

12:26.528 --> 12:27.659
A laugh, Hock?

12:30.358 --> 12:31.185
This isn't funny.

12:38.975 --> 12:43.023
Listen, you can all
roll your eyes

12:43.066 --> 12:44.981
until they snap off
inside your head.

12:46.026 --> 12:47.854
But I started going to church

12:49.769 --> 12:54.295
three days a week
after Susie... left.

12:55.296 --> 12:57.254
I was looking for answers.

12:57.298 --> 13:00.083
You know, why she did
what she did.

13:01.737 --> 13:05.045
And afterwards, every
time I would sit down

13:05.480 --> 13:08.309
with the reverend and
he would tell me

13:08.352 --> 13:09.745
all about the afterlife.

13:11.268 --> 13:14.358
He would go on and on
about the glory of heaven

13:14.402 --> 13:16.839
and the fires of hell.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.623
He told me all about redemption,

13:19.624 --> 13:25.369
and all the babies in purgatory,
and everything in between.

13:27.154 --> 13:30.418
And after going to mass
for four weeks,

13:31.549 --> 13:34.944
like some sort of
brainwashed schmuck,

13:35.379 --> 13:38.078
that holier-than-thou son
of a bitch had the nerve

13:38.121 --> 13:41.690
to say that what Susie
did was unforgivable.

13:43.344 --> 13:48.262
That my wife, a good
church-going patriot,

13:49.567 --> 13:54.616
was damned to hell
because of what she did?!

13:55.922 --> 13:57.445
I mean, do you know why
she did what she did?!

13:59.447 --> 14:02.232
It was because of the
Krauts next door!

14:04.669 --> 14:06.976
She knew they were spying
for the Nazis!

14:10.588 --> 14:13.156
And I didn't believe her.
Nobody did.

14:14.157 --> 14:16.116
And she couldn't take that.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.380
She couldn't take
that her friends

14:19.423 --> 14:22.557
and her family didn't
believe her.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.212
But what was she gonna do?

14:25.255 --> 14:28.824
She put it in the reports,
and no one was listening.

14:29.259 --> 14:32.001
And then on
Thanksgiving morning,

14:33.263 --> 14:35.222
right before I went out
for a pack of Raleighs,

14:36.484 --> 14:37.398
she said it again.

14:39.052 --> 14:40.531
She said they were
moving in on her,

14:40.880 --> 14:42.794
that they knew that she knew.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.799
And I, I jus- I, I laughed.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.063
I just, I laughed at her.

14:51.368 --> 14:55.329
And then when I came
back, she was just all...

14:57.853 --> 15:01.857
and that priest, he had
the nerve to say

15:01.901 --> 15:03.685
that she was damned to hell.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.428
Well, I just walked out.

15:07.471 --> 15:12.433
I mean, I gave up, quit
believing in any of it.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.391
I decided right there and then

15:15.436 --> 15:17.612
that if Susie was
damned to hell,

15:17.655 --> 15:19.614
then the whole thing was
fucking bullshit!

15:22.051 --> 15:25.098
All of it! When you die,
it's just... just nothing.

15:25.402 --> 15:27.317
You're just fucking worm food.

15:28.231 --> 15:30.190
And then I started
thinking about that,

15:31.191 --> 15:35.760
and that seemed
[gasping] even scarier.

15:37.545 --> 15:42.593
So t-t-there's just nothing?
That Susie's just gone,

15:42.637 --> 15:45.466
Gone forever because I
didn't listen to her?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.556
-I didn't believe her?
-Hock.

15:49.513 --> 15:50.036
[sigh]

15:51.037 --> 15:52.908
Sweetheart, we all miss Susie.

15:54.127 --> 15:56.999
Then please, will you humor me?

15:59.045 --> 16:00.872
I mean, I think it's
abundantly clear

16:00.916 --> 16:02.222
that I'm not in a good place.

16:04.354 --> 16:06.008
I've held out as much hope
as any man can.

16:07.183 --> 16:11.231
And now I just, I need
you to do this.

16:12.710 --> 16:15.191
I need this. I need
this from you.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.324
Here. Now.

16:18.978 --> 16:24.157
Sir, we are here for you.

16:25.549 --> 16:26.246
But not for this.

16:32.687 --> 16:34.167
I am not comfortable right now.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.951
Meet my friends, we're
never comfortable.

16:40.651 --> 16:43.611
[calming music]

16:45.656 --> 16:47.223
Sit down, Paul.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.314
Okay.

16:53.403 --> 16:59.018
Don't you just hope after
all this death, the war,

16:59.366 --> 17:02.499
all the nightmares... that
there's something else?

17:03.544 --> 17:06.025
I already believe Hock,
I don't need to see it.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.376
You remember Jimmy Rogers?

17:10.550 --> 17:13.205
That poor kid we tried to staple
back together in Normandy?

17:14.685 --> 17:18.211
Don't you just want to
know that he's still

17:18.253 --> 17:20.300
got that smile on his
face out there somewhere?

17:23.041 --> 17:23.825
What about you?

17:25.392 --> 17:28.830
Don't you wish you had proof
that all the other fellas

17:28.873 --> 17:32.964
at your base, they didn't
just burst into dust and flame

17:33.008 --> 17:35.184
when those Kraut bombs
came raining down on them?

17:37.273 --> 17:41.756
-And your wife, Clive.
-And my wife.

17:43.801 --> 17:44.976
All right, so where,

17:45.020 --> 17:46.630
where are you keeping
the Ouija board?

17:47.153 --> 17:48.328
Oh, well this is different,
Arch.

17:49.764 --> 17:52.027
See with Ouija, the spirits
speak through the board,

17:54.029 --> 17:56.814
writing messages and
stories and such.

17:57.511 --> 18:03.212
But with a séance, the spirits
speak directly through us.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.563
All you really need
is a mirror,

18:08.261 --> 18:12.047
and a couple of friends who
aren't afraid to hold hands.

18:12.395 --> 18:15.137
What do you say, Paulie? Will
you hold my hand?

18:19.185 --> 18:20.142
[laughing]

18:20.490 --> 18:21.839
I need a scotch.

18:21.883 --> 18:24.407
Ah, ah, ah... We're supposed
to have clear minds.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.496
Clear minds, Hock?

18:26.540 --> 18:28.542
You're three fucking
bottles in already.

18:28.933 --> 18:31.675
[scoffing] Well, then we
split this one.

18:31.936 --> 18:32.981

18:43.774 --> 18:49.215
-[lights buzzing]
-[soft uneasy music]

18:49.650 --> 18:54.437
So they, they say if you
have something

18:54.481 --> 18:56.787
that belonged to the person
you're trying to contact,

18:58.180 --> 19:02.532
that it's a little easier.

19:02.576 --> 19:03.881
Is that Susan's handkerchief?

19:04.621 --> 19:05.970
Oh my God, Hock.

19:07.537 --> 19:09.670
-Why'd you hold onto that?
-[handkerchief ripping]

19:10.627 --> 19:12.238
I, I wanna be clear.

19:12.281 --> 19:15.415
I, I believe in the afterlife,
I believe in heaven and hell.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.200
I believe Susie's out there,
but I don't believe in this.

19:21.943 --> 19:25.076
-Look,
-[necklace clanking]

19:29.255 --> 19:32.345
if we can just make
contact with anyone,

19:34.042 --> 19:38.786
if we can just confirm that
there's something else.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.005
Whatever, Hock.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.531
Just don't play us for a
bunch of fools.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.186
This ain't about that
kid in Normandy,

19:48.970 --> 19:51.494
and it ain't about Marla's
fellas at the base.

19:52.278 --> 19:56.238
No this, [finger tapping],
this is about Susie.

19:57.674 --> 20:01.461
All right. Fine.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.114
[clears throat]

20:16.258 --> 20:18.565
Okay, I don't exactly know
what I'm doing,

20:20.219 --> 20:22.177
but if there are any
spirits here,

20:24.788 --> 20:26.181
we'd love to talk to ya.

20:27.182 --> 20:29.402
How do we, you know... know
if it's working?

20:30.751 --> 20:32.492
If it's gonna work, it'll work.

20:33.101 --> 20:34.450
Okay but Hock, if it
doesn't work,

20:34.494 --> 20:35.930
I don't want you to
stop believing

20:35.973 --> 20:37.236
Susie is out there somewhere.

20:39.063 --> 20:42.806
Faith is about what
you can't see.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.374
Yeah, well that's where
we're different, darlin'.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.377
I got no faith left.

20:52.033 --> 20:55.210
If there are any spirits here...

20:57.647 --> 20:58.779
Make yourselves known.

21:01.999 --> 21:05.438
Spirits? Give us a sign.

21:06.569 --> 21:08.528
Anything. Please.

21:11.139 --> 21:13.446
Please! Give us a sign,
anything!

21:15.404 --> 21:16.275
Give us a sign.

21:21.192 --> 21:22.933
-[door slams loudly]
-Oh my God!

21:22.977 --> 21:23.891
What the hell was that?

21:24.283 --> 21:26.633
Hey, don't let go.

21:27.982 --> 21:29.853
-You can't break the circle.
-What?

21:29.897 --> 21:32.552
We have to end the séance
before we break the circle.

21:33.204 --> 21:35.424
Otherwise, the door to the
other side remains open.

21:36.077 --> 21:39.602
And how exactly do you close
the door to the other side?

21:39.646 --> 21:41.822
Because I vote for that.

21:42.344 --> 21:43.737
[door slams loudly]

21:44.694 --> 21:45.869
What the hell is that?

21:47.480 --> 21:48.524
Come on, Hock. Did you lock
your cat in the closet again?

21:48.568 --> 21:51.005
-[door thuds]
-Nobody gets up!

21:51.919 --> 21:53.007
Give us a sign!

21:53.486 --> 21:54.704
That wasn't good enough for you?

21:54.748 --> 21:56.706
It sure as hell wasn't
good enough for me.

21:57.141 --> 21:58.969
You're gonna have to do a
lot better than that, ghosts!

21:59.013 --> 21:59.927
[door slams]

21:59.970 --> 22:02.059
All right, everyone just focus!

22:02.495 --> 22:04.061
Focus?! Focus on what?

22:04.105 --> 22:06.847
On the closet that none of
us are allowed to check out?

22:08.805 --> 22:10.416
Now you listen to me, Colonel.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.593
I'm here for you... all the way.

22:14.898 --> 22:19.076
But this, this isn't
gonna fix anything.

22:20.817 --> 22:22.602
Now, if you want to know
if there's something

22:22.645 --> 22:24.560
on the other side, that's fine.

22:24.604 --> 22:27.041
But you're gonna have to
dig a hell of a lot deeper

22:27.084 --> 22:29.173

41:11.817 --> 41:14.167
That's what he'd been trying
to tell me all afternoon.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.736
-What?
-He wanted me to kill this woman

41:17.779 --> 41:19.477
before y'all even showed up.

41:21.130 --> 41:24.090
And right, right before he
popped himself,

41:25.047 --> 41:28.224
he said he needed me to
do something for him,

41:28.268 --> 41:29.965
before he would even
let me leave.

41:30.313 --> 41:32.751
I don't get it. If he
wanted to kill her,

41:32.794 --> 41:34.056
why didn't he just
do it himself?

41:35.623 --> 41:37.059
Because Hock wasn't a killer.

41:39.366 --> 41:42.543
I'm sorry, Colonel Clive
Hockstatter wasn't a killer?

41:43.109 --> 41:44.502
Oh, he had no problem
with killing.

41:45.459 --> 41:46.765
He just couldn't do it himself.

41:47.853 --> 41:49.811
He'd freeze up, look
like he was gonna heave.

41:49.855 --> 41:53.206
Any time there was blood,
he'd send in someone else

41:53.249 --> 41:56.035
to get their hands red,
someone like me.

41:56.992 --> 41:58.994
-That's drivel.
-No, it's true.

42:00.169 --> 42:03.521
No, no fellas, all those
stories he regaled to me,

42:03.564 --> 42:05.261
-on and on and--
-Marla.

42:05.305 --> 42:06.393
-What?
-That was bunko.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.265
You know how he felt about you.

42:11.354 --> 42:13.487
He would say anything to put
stars in your pretty eyes.

42:15.315 --> 42:19.275
Excuse me... may we please
get back to me?

42:19.841 --> 42:21.408
-Sure.
-Arch, knock it off.

42:21.451 --> 42:23.845
No, I want some straight
dope on why Susie and Hock

42:23.889 --> 42:25.238
thought this dame was a Nazi.

42:27.066 --> 42:30.156
Because, because I'm German...
Archie?

42:31.331 --> 42:32.767
Because I sound like the enemy.

42:33.638 --> 42:37.424
Well, if it looks like a duck
and it quacks like a duck.

42:37.816 --> 42:39.731
It could still be a goose.

42:41.602 --> 42:44.213
You know, when
we came to America...

42:45.345 --> 42:46.912
It was for a better life.

42:49.305 --> 42:51.656
They told us it was The
Great Melting Pot.

42:52.918 --> 42:56.617
A place where every
race, every religion,

42:57.662 --> 42:59.098
every language was welcome.

43:01.666 --> 43:04.146
Silver-tongued government
propaganda, all of it.

43:08.803 --> 43:11.371
Hey! That's Hock's booze.

43:11.980 --> 43:15.375
- Ja? well he owes me one.

43:17.725 --> 43:19.074
[Hildegard clears throat]

43:22.730 --> 43:23.949
It's easy to create an enemy.

43:25.428 --> 43:29.650
All you need are slanty
eyes, different color skin,

43:31.130 --> 43:32.000
or an accent.

43:35.177 --> 43:36.918
But it's always better
if they speak

43:36.962 --> 43:38.267
a different tongue, isn't it?

43:41.314 --> 43:43.882
Must be easier to kill someone
when you can't understand

43:43.925 --> 43:45.797
their cries for help.
-Shut up.

43:46.885 --> 43:49.191
You've killed a lot of
Germans, haven't you?

43:49.235 --> 43:50.628
So what's one more?

43:51.063 --> 43:53.805
But when was the last
time you killed someone

43:54.632 --> 43:56.372
who could tell you their
husband's name,

43:58.157 --> 44:00.159
or their children's
favorite radio show?

44:00.550 --> 44:01.290
[gun clicks]

44:02.857 --> 44:05.773
I'm not some nameless soldier
shouting fascist nonsense.

44:06.208 --> 44:08.297
I'm a green grocer who
came to New York

44:08.341 --> 44:10.125
chasing the American dream.

44:13.041 --> 44:17.829
My friends call me Hildy.
My husband's name is Juürgen.

44:19.700 --> 44:22.224
My girls go to PS 124.

44:25.053 --> 44:26.489
And we let them
stay up to listen

44:26.533 --> 44:28.056
to "The Charlotte
Greenwood Show".

44:30.232 --> 44:33.671
-Goddamn it.
-Are we good?

44:34.802 --> 44:39.589
No, I'm not gonna shoot
you, but I don't like you.

44:40.199 --> 44:41.287
I don't like your name,

44:42.549 --> 44:43.768
and I don't like you
living in my country.

44:45.552 --> 44:49.687
Well, suppose that's a start,
isn't it?

44:54.648 --> 44:56.041
Now, can we please
open the door?

44:56.476 --> 44:58.870
No, we cannot.

45:00.872 --> 45:02.787
You know, y'all might
fall for a solid

45:02.830 --> 45:06.225
dog and pony show, but not me.

45:09.228 --> 45:12.840
Let's see... when was
the last time

45:12.884 --> 45:15.625
I killed someone who
spoke English?

45:17.410 --> 45:19.586
Yeah, a year and
a half ago in Salerno.

45:21.153 --> 45:25.070
A weasely little Wop with
big brown eyes...

45:26.332 --> 45:28.943
Looked me up and down
half a dozen times

45:28.987 --> 45:31.903
before stammering out,
"I l-l-love America."

45:34.296 --> 45:36.559
[sips drink and sighs]

45:37.125 --> 45:38.692
I stabbed that little
Dago right in the mouth.

45:41.086 --> 45:41.956
Do you wanna know why?

45:44.045 --> 45:45.655
Because given half a chance,

45:45.699 --> 45:48.223
he would've done the
same Goddamn thing to me.

45:49.224 --> 45:52.227
Or maybe he was just a
scared Italian boy,

45:52.662 --> 45:54.795
who secretly loved America.

45:58.364 --> 46:00.758
Get those words outta your
mouth, you dirty Kraut.

46:02.411 --> 46:03.195
[glass hitting table]

46:04.762 --> 46:07.025
You don't get to talk about
my country. Neither did he.

46:09.549 --> 46:10.768
This is my country!!!

46:12.726 --> 46:13.379
Land of the free.

46:14.119 --> 46:16.034
Pssh! She's a Nazi!

46:17.122 --> 46:18.732
You say your last
name's DiFranco?

46:19.428 --> 46:20.821
What of it?

46:20.865 --> 46:23.998
You boast of killing
Italians, and yet you are one.

46:27.872 --> 46:29.003
She's takin' us for a walk.

46:30.048 --> 46:32.354
Jesus. Breathe, DiFranco.

46:32.659 --> 46:34.400
After all we've seen tonight,
she knows!

46:34.748 --> 46:35.793
What? What have you seen?

46:37.098 --> 46:38.186
You were in the closet,
didn't you hear it?

46:38.970 --> 46:40.406
Well, I, I was drugged.

46:40.449 --> 46:42.277
I-I think I'm still drugged.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.976
-Damn it.
-I heard voices.

46:45.411 --> 46:49.632
I heard Clive yelling and,
and a gunshot.

46:50.068 --> 46:52.244
I panicked, I started
kicking harder.

46:53.332 --> 46:57.292
There was a... a séance.
[chuckling]

46:58.903 --> 47:00.687
And we connected with, with-

47:01.079 --> 47:04.169
Why are you telling
her any of this?

47:04.909 --> 47:06.127
It was Susan! She told Clive--

47:06.171 --> 47:07.868
Shut up, Bob.

47:09.478 --> 47:11.437
What are you trying to
accomplish here Paul, huh?

47:13.265 --> 47:14.919
Open the Goddamn door!

47:14.962 --> 47:17.530
Or what, Marla? You
going to break my finger?

47:17.573 --> 47:18.618
Oh, I might.

47:19.924 --> 47:20.489
Why don't you just try
and interrogate it open?

47:20.533 --> 47:21.316
Okay.

47:22.448 --> 47:24.798
She's on the beam, Paul.
Open the door.

47:25.320 --> 47:26.408
Three minutes, Arch.

47:27.932 --> 47:30.151
That's how long it's been
since you've had your doubts,

47:30.195 --> 47:32.588
and now you're willing to let
this bitch stroll outta here.

47:33.938 --> 47:37.680
Classic. Right when I
need you, you turn faggot.

47:39.508 --> 47:40.466
Excuse me?

47:42.903 --> 47:43.686
You know what I mean.

47:44.992 --> 47:46.515
Yeah, I do. But I'm gonna
pretend like I don't

47:46.559 --> 47:48.300
and we're still being
cordial to one another.

47:48.343 --> 47:49.475
Oh, for God's sake.

47:49.518 --> 47:51.129
If you've got a problem Major,
speak up.

47:52.260 --> 47:54.045
But it'd better be
about Brownshirts,

47:54.088 --> 47:55.829
and not wearing I'm
dippin' my dick.

47:57.048 --> 47:58.179
We're on the same team, Paulie.

48:00.616 --> 48:04.838
Thanks for the reminder...
Baby Butcher.

48:05.056 --> 48:08.581
-[tense ominous music]
-What does that mean?

48:09.190 --> 48:09.974
Nothin'.

48:11.801 --> 48:12.846
What does that mean, Paul?

48:14.543 --> 48:15.066
Well...

48:17.329 --> 48:21.159
it might mean, that Archie here,

48:22.290 --> 48:24.684
asked me to stand before
the grand jury

48:24.727 --> 48:26.077
and tell them that I did not see

48:26.120 --> 48:28.253
what I definitely saw
back in Berlin.

48:30.385 --> 48:31.430
All to protect my friend,

48:33.345 --> 48:34.999
and the reputation of
this great country.

48:36.217 --> 48:38.611
I knew it. Dammit, I
knew you did it.

48:38.654 --> 48:40.395
-Shut up.
-Archie?

48:43.442 --> 48:45.923
Paul... he did it?

48:46.662 --> 48:49.404
[soft uneasy music]

48:51.406 --> 48:52.190
You did it?

48:53.974 --> 48:55.062
Archie was right, Marla.

48:57.151 --> 48:59.806
You've never had two dozen
Nazis charging at you.

49:01.242 --> 49:03.244
He's not being tried
for killing Nazis, Paul.

49:06.291 --> 49:08.249
He's being tried
for killing children.

49:08.989 --> 49:11.209
[soft ominous music]

49:11.252 --> 49:14.038
You're Archibald Stanton,
from the news radio?

49:15.865 --> 49:17.867
The Berlin Butcher?

49:20.261 --> 49:22.307
You said the kid who who
did it was, was dead.

49:23.612 --> 49:24.396
Surprise.

49:27.442 --> 49:28.617
Oh, I'm going to be sick.

49:30.837 --> 49:31.969
Don't be so dramatic, Marla.

49:32.012 --> 49:33.231
You're starting to
sound like Hock.

49:33.274 --> 49:34.145
Shut up.

49:34.667 --> 49:35.842
I told you he did it.

49:38.236 --> 49:41.195
You wanna know what
happened, Marla? Huh?

49:43.981 --> 49:46.679
We were being picked off
by two Nazi sharpshooters.

49:47.941 --> 49:51.989
One by one, kid after
screaming all-American kid.

49:52.293 --> 49:53.991
Hock knew we had to
take that rooftop.

49:56.254 --> 50:00.214
So he told Archie that
if he led the charge

50:00.910 --> 50:04.001
and saved even one more of
our boys from sniper fire,

50:05.045 --> 50:07.091
he'd have a hero's
welcome when he got home.

50:07.830 --> 50:09.049
He said he was my Colonel,

50:10.398 --> 50:11.921
and that if anything went wrong,

50:11.965 --> 50:13.358
he would take responsibility.

50:14.185 --> 50:15.142
I didn't think about it.

50:16.274 --> 50:17.710
In war, you don't
have time to think.

50:17.753 --> 50:19.755
You look at the faces of the
men you've sworn to save,

50:19.799 --> 50:21.018
and you race into hell.

50:21.322 --> 50:22.671
And I... I ran straight for
that building,

50:24.151 --> 50:25.979
praying that if one of
the countless bullets

50:26.023 --> 50:28.199
I heard whizzing past
my ears actually hit me,

50:29.722 --> 50:32.855
that it'd be over quick,
and I wouldn't be left

50:32.899 --> 50:34.422
flopping around on the road.

50:35.684 --> 50:37.208
And I pressed against that wall.

50:37.251 --> 50:38.339
Oh God...

50:38.383 --> 50:40.037
Broke the first window
I came to and,

50:42.430 --> 50:44.606
tossed a belt of pineapples
into that building.

50:45.868 --> 50:49.046
It wasn't until after the
smoke cleared that we saw--

50:49.611 --> 50:51.526
It was a kindergarten center.

50:52.745 --> 50:54.355
I've been reading about
this for weeks.

50:55.965 --> 50:57.532
It was a children's shelter.

50:58.011 --> 50:59.230
War isn't fair, Kraut.

51:00.144 --> 51:02.102
I followed my orders
to the letter,

51:02.146 --> 51:03.930
I did exactly as I was told.

51:05.149 --> 51:06.628
Our boys took the roof,

51:07.325 --> 51:10.067
knocked off their snipers
and saved our soldiers.

51:11.242 --> 51:15.463
Fifty-six children.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.161
[sighs]

51:18.466 --> 51:19.859
You knew they were in there.

51:21.252 --> 51:23.080
Everyone knew they
were in there.

51:23.558 --> 51:25.038
It was a registered shelter.

51:25.430 --> 51:28.128
Hock knew. He just didn't care.

51:28.607 --> 51:31.610
God... damn it.

51:32.219 --> 51:34.003
When the press asked, he
made up a story

51:34.047 --> 51:35.831
about a trigger-happy private,

51:36.354 --> 51:38.007
said he was killed in the blast.

51:40.140 --> 51:44.144
But people started talking.

51:45.928 --> 51:48.409
Soldiers started putting it
together and I, I got worried,

51:49.193 --> 51:50.672
but he said everything
was gonna be okay.

51:50.716 --> 51:53.458
He was gonna clear my name
and keep me outta prison,

51:54.937 --> 51:56.678
and that everyone was
going to eat crow.

51:59.116 --> 52:03.859
And that people would
stop saying those awful,

52:04.904 --> 52:07.689
awful things to my mama every
time she left her house.

52:08.995 --> 52:13.217
Well... Clive just blew his
brains out, so...

52:19.223 --> 52:23.140
-[dark music]
-I'm a good man.

52:25.011 --> 52:27.709
I mean, who, who... who are you?

52:30.059 --> 52:32.018
I mean, what, what kind of man?

52:32.279 --> 52:33.150
You can't say that.

52:35.500 --> 52:39.068
You weren't there... It happens.

52:40.287 --> 52:41.332
"It happens"?!

52:42.463 --> 52:44.944
God, all those kids.

52:45.945 --> 52:48.208
I mean, what kind
of man, would--

52:48.252 --> 52:49.166
[Hildegard] A good one.

52:50.689 --> 52:53.387
In war, good men are tasked
with doing terrible things

52:53.431 --> 52:54.519
every single day.

52:55.737 --> 52:57.391
This does not make them
terrible people.

52:58.610 --> 53:00.177
[Paul] And what do you
know about war?

53:01.395 --> 53:03.441
I know my family is
still in Berlin.

53:03.745 --> 53:05.747
My nieces and nephews...

53:06.966 --> 53:08.054
They could have been
in that school,

53:09.751 --> 53:12.885
but somehow I cannot call
you a monster, Major Stanton.

53:14.539 --> 53:17.194
You were fighting for
your country.

53:18.499 --> 53:19.718
You were doing your job.

53:20.284 --> 53:22.634
-[soft ominous music]
-I was... I still am.

53:25.637 --> 53:26.986
I'm not a bad man.

53:27.769 --> 53:30.032
No, none of us are bad.

53:30.468 --> 53:33.819
We simply do as, as we
are commanded.

53:35.429 --> 53:37.997
And just who is your Commander?

53:40.260 --> 53:42.784
I thought you worked in
a grocery store

53:42.828 --> 53:44.308
with your father-in-law.

53:44.612 --> 53:46.048
Ja, I do.

53:46.527 --> 53:48.137
And you call him... Commander?

53:48.181 --> 53:50.662
No, no, I do not call
him Commander.

53:50.705 --> 53:54.100
I, I work for him, so
I do as as he commands.

53:54.492 --> 53:55.884
Don't play with me, bitch.

53:57.321 --> 53:59.236
I can see your mask slipping

53:59.279 --> 54:00.889
every time you open your mouth.

54:02.326 --> 54:05.416
I have tried to express to
you that I do not believe

54:05.459 --> 54:08.506
a man's singular actions
make him evil.

54:09.550 --> 54:10.899
Especially if that man believes

54:10.943 --> 54:12.640
that what he is doing is moral.

54:13.772 --> 54:16.209
I do not believe Major
Stanton to be a bad man,

54:16.253 --> 54:18.733
simply because he was
following orders.

54:19.473 --> 54:22.041
Just like I do not believe
you to, to be a bad man,

54:22.389 --> 54:24.435
because you are trying
to protect your friend,

54:24.783 --> 54:25.958
and your country.

54:28.526 --> 54:29.091
Say it.

54:32.965 --> 54:35.968
Some days I can even
try to believe

54:36.360 --> 54:39.232
that my mentally ill
neighbors who were only acting

54:39.276 --> 54:42.148
out of a crushing love for
their government and homeland

54:43.192 --> 54:45.412
were not bad people.

54:46.370 --> 54:47.240
[Paul] Say it.

54:49.503 --> 54:55.204
My name is Hildy Bauman. I
moved to New York in 1931.

54:57.032 --> 54:59.208
My father-in-law owns the
grocery two blocks away.

54:59.252 --> 55:02.342
I work there! I live
three doors down from here

55:02.386 --> 55:04.779
with my husband and
my two girls.

55:04.823 --> 55:10.045
-Say it.
-[soft uneasy music]

55:14.528 --> 55:18.315
-I am an American.
-Liar!!!

55:18.706 --> 55:22.449
Can we please just open the
door and call the police?

55:22.493 --> 55:24.103
-[radio screeching]
-♪ Is you is or is you ain't♪

55:24.146 --> 55:25.887
-Not again.
-For God's sake.

55:26.671 --> 55:27.454
[radio stops]

55:30.414 --> 55:31.893
What are you
gonna do, Paul? Huh?!

55:32.503 --> 55:34.809
Kill her right here in
Hock's brownstone?! Is that--

55:34.853 --> 55:36.855
Just open the door, Paul!

55:36.898 --> 55:39.205
They're right Major,
open the door.

55:39.248 --> 55:40.946
We're losing our
heaven-sent minds.

55:41.642 --> 55:42.339
You can't mean that.

55:43.209 --> 55:44.166
Please, Major.

55:48.606 --> 55:50.042
I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

55:52.784 --> 55:56.788
Archie, you are an
American hero.

55:58.746 --> 55:59.747
You're not the kind
of man who lets

55:59.791 --> 56:01.880
a Nazi spy walk out of a room.

56:04.491 --> 56:05.884
-Marla.
-What?

56:06.188 --> 56:07.712
The Krauts bombed your base.

56:07.755 --> 56:09.322
Yeah.

56:09.366 --> 56:12.281
They burnt your pretty body
and left you with a gimp leg.

56:12.325 --> 56:14.893
They killed every friend
you had outside this room.

56:14.936 --> 56:15.850
I know.

56:17.722 --> 56:19.027
-Bob.
-Yeah?

56:21.726 --> 56:24.119
Well, I don't know tits
about what it is you do.

56:25.207 --> 56:28.254
But somehow I doubt that
the Pentagon would allow

56:28.297 --> 56:30.169
a Nazi sympathizer to
push their pencils.

56:36.480 --> 56:38.786
Really? Nobody?

56:41.528 --> 56:46.011
Well in that case Major,
I'll make you a deal.

56:48.317 --> 56:53.322
I give you the key, you
give me the gun.

56:53.627 --> 56:54.933
Absolutely not.

56:54.976 --> 56:56.587
I am not speaking to you, Bob.

56:57.239 --> 57:00.025
I'm sorry Major, but I
can't do that.

57:04.290 --> 57:08.425
Well then, I guess we'd
better get cozy.

57:09.295 --> 57:11.645
To hell with you then,
and to hell with this!

57:11.689 --> 57:13.299
Archie, what are you doing?!

57:13.342 --> 57:15.823
[gunshots]

57:17.129 --> 57:20.915
[grunting] God damn it!

57:21.350 --> 57:25.659
[gasping] I- I don't understand.

57:30.142 --> 57:31.622
-Why won't it open?
-[gun blasting]

57:34.059 --> 57:35.234
Check the rounds.

57:35.277 --> 57:37.845
[gun clicking]

57:37.889 --> 57:40.065
Well, the bullet Clive
used sure worked!

57:40.108 --> 57:44.199
Enough! Paul I need you
to take the key

57:44.243 --> 57:47.159
out of your pocket and
open the goddam door.

57:47.812 --> 57:49.509
This is not up for discussion,

57:50.031 --> 57:52.251
and I don't want to point
a weapon at my friend.

57:53.557 --> 57:55.384
Oh, Archie...

57:57.256 --> 57:58.083
Please, Major?

58:00.128 --> 58:03.480
Fine. Fuck all'a ya.

58:10.095 --> 58:14.447
But, if you make me
open this door

58:16.057 --> 58:18.059
and go against everything I am,

58:20.671 --> 58:22.803
I will not take the stand
for you, Archie.

58:25.284 --> 58:29.810
Oh, I will stand, before
my God and my country,

58:31.029 --> 58:33.379
and I will tell them how
you spinelessly

58:33.422 --> 58:36.121
blew those toddlers
limb from limb,

58:36.164 --> 58:38.166
just like the newsmen
say you did.

58:38.732 --> 58:42.475
Hock had me come early
before any of y'all,

58:44.390 --> 58:48.089
to do what he couldn't do,
what, what Susie couldn't do.

58:48.873 --> 58:50.657
He wanted me to kill this woman.

58:51.919 --> 58:53.834
And if you make me
open this door,

58:54.618 --> 58:57.490
I will follow that Nazi
home and beat her to death

58:57.534 --> 58:58.622
in front of her family.

58:58.665 --> 59:01.102
-[gun clicking]
-[soft tense music]

59:01.146 --> 59:02.930
I am not a Nazi.

59:02.974 --> 59:04.802
-[cane crashing]
-That's it!!!

59:05.803 --> 59:06.891
What's it?

59:07.282 --> 59:08.501
You wanna know if she's a Nazi,
Paul?

59:08.980 --> 59:10.503
Huh? Is that it? You want proof?

59:11.243 --> 59:12.200
Is that the only way
you're gonna let us out

59:12.244 --> 59:13.593
of this Goddamn room?

59:13.898 --> 59:15.029
I already know.

59:15.639 --> 59:16.465
You don't know squat.

59:17.554 --> 59:18.816
And if you're not
gonna help, and

59:18.859 --> 59:20.557
if you're just gonna
panic, I'm taking charge.

59:23.385 --> 59:25.431
If this were my base, I'd
demand all three of you

59:25.474 --> 59:27.955
get out of this room, but
apparently that's not an option.

59:27.999 --> 59:30.610
-So get over there.
-What?

59:30.915 --> 59:32.133
Go over there, all of you.

59:33.308 --> 59:34.614
What are you doing, Marla?

59:35.659 --> 59:38.096
My job... my shitty job.

59:38.662 --> 59:40.272
Marla. I don't think
that's the best idea.

59:40.315 --> 59:42.230
You know what? I'm
all out of ideas.

59:44.406 --> 59:46.104
This will confirm it one
way or another, go on.

59:51.109 --> 59:51.892
Go on.

59:55.417 --> 59:56.418
Sit, Frau Bauman.

59:57.985 --> 01:00:00.858
Um... why?

01:00:01.902 --> 01:00:03.121
Because I told you to.

01:00:04.122 --> 01:00:07.038
[soft ominous music]

01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:20.617
[cane tapping]

01:00:27.014 --> 01:00:28.189
I don't think you're a spy.

01:00:29.582 --> 01:00:31.149
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me.

01:00:34.282 --> 01:00:36.589
We've apparently found
ourselves in a situation

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:38.156
where you and I can't
leave this room

01:00:38.199 --> 01:00:40.158
until we are certain
you're not a Nazi.

01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:48.470
Hold my hand, Hildy.

01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:57.001
[soft ominous music]

01:00:58.089 --> 01:00:58.872
Fuck you, Paul.

01:00:59.873 --> 01:01:01.092
What, what is-

01:01:01.396 --> 01:01:02.180
Sh-sh-sh.

01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:07.925
[speaking in German]

01:01:08.403 --> 01:01:09.187
Hmm?

01:01:10.797 --> 01:01:11.624
Mm-hmm.

01:01:13.452 --> 01:01:15.149
Stay with me now, Hildy.
Here we go.

01:01:19.066 --> 01:01:21.939
You need to listen to me very
closely right now Hildy, hmm?

01:01:24.942 --> 01:01:27.031
If you stand up, you'll
be admitting guilt.

01:01:28.597 --> 01:01:30.643
If you attempt to break free,
you'll be admitting guilt.

01:01:31.383 --> 01:01:33.602
You will stay seated
with your hand in mine,

01:01:33.646 --> 01:01:36.083
until I tell you our time
together is complete.

01:01:36.867 --> 01:01:38.129
-But--
-You will answer

01:01:38.172 --> 01:01:39.739
every question no matter
how many times I ask it.

01:01:43.743 --> 01:01:45.179
And although it might
seem otherwise,

01:01:45.223 --> 01:01:47.094
you and I are alone,
quite alone right now.

01:01:52.143 --> 01:01:55.712
Now, what is your full name?

01:01:56.669 --> 01:01:58.192
Um, Hildegard Bauman.

01:02:00.673 --> 01:02:02.370
Are you now, or have
you ever been

01:02:02.414 --> 01:02:04.764
a member of the National
Socialist German Workers Party?

01:02:05.939 --> 01:02:07.767
No, the Nazi party no
longer exists.

01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:08.812
That's not what I asked.

01:02:09.247 --> 01:02:12.076
No, no, no, no, no. Mm-mm. No.

01:02:14.208 --> 01:02:15.514
Who's your primary employer?

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.472
Bergen Street Grocery.

01:02:17.908 --> 01:02:19.257
What's your husband's full name?

01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:23.174
-Juürgen Bauman.
-Mm-hmm.

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.093
What are your daughter's names?

01:02:33.662 --> 01:02:35.186
Robin and Melissa Bauman.

01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:40.234
Why did Susan
Hockstatter believe

01:02:40.278 --> 01:02:42.149
you were a spy for the
German government?

01:02:42.193 --> 01:02:43.760
Because she was a sick woman.

01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:44.630
Bullshit.

01:02:46.937 --> 01:02:48.112
Did you want me to stop, Paul?

01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:52.333
Why did Susan
Hockstatter believe

01:02:52.377 --> 01:02:54.074
you were a spy for the
German government?

01:02:54.118 --> 01:02:55.989
-I told you.
-You will answer.

01:02:56.381 --> 01:02:58.513
Oh, no. [gasping]

01:02:58.557 --> 01:03:01.081
All of my questions, no matter
how many times I ask them.

01:03:02.822 --> 01:03:04.258
Why did Susan
Hockstatter...

01:03:06.347 --> 01:03:08.436
believe you were a spy for the
German government?

01:03:09.698 --> 01:03:11.526
Because, because I
have an accent.

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:16.009
Because she needed a
personification of her fears.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.230
Because she wasn't ready
for this war to be over.

01:03:21.014 --> 01:03:22.363
And her husband,
Clive Hockstatter?

01:03:23.756 --> 01:03:25.976
He- he didn't believe
her when she was alive.

01:03:26.628 --> 01:03:28.805
It was only after she
died that he needed

01:03:28.848 --> 01:03:31.416
a- a target to aim
his guilt at.

01:03:32.852 --> 01:03:34.288
I became that target.

01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:36.987
You do realize the
Hockstatters were not religious

01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:38.597
or political fanatics, correct?

01:03:39.728 --> 01:03:41.426
That they were
high-ranking military,

01:03:42.079 --> 01:03:44.037
and upstanding members of
their community?

01:03:45.604 --> 01:03:46.866
- Ja.
-Yeah.

01:03:47.693 --> 01:03:51.392
But they were
sick people. [screaming]

01:03:51.436 --> 01:03:55.048
Hildy! Fraäulein!
Are you now,

01:03:55.657 --> 01:03:57.398
or have you ever been a
member of the Nazi party?

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.836
Nein... Nein...

01:04:00.227 --> 01:04:03.230
Are you now or have you
ever been a member

01:04:03.274 --> 01:04:05.580
of the National Socialist
German Workers Party?

01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:09.846
What? ...No! [screaming]

01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:12.196
Are you now, or have
you ever been a member

01:04:12.239 --> 01:04:15.286
of the National Socialist
German Workers Party?

01:04:16.548 --> 01:04:19.072
Nein... Nein.

01:04:21.422 --> 01:04:22.510
What's your full name?

01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:29.648
Hildy... [whimpering]
Hildegard Bauman.

01:04:32.477 --> 01:04:33.608
Verzeíhung.

01:04:33.652 --> 01:04:39.310
[Hildegard gasping]

01:04:44.228 --> 01:04:45.011
[cane tapping]

01:04:48.841 --> 01:04:50.451
Open the door Paul.
She's not a Nazi.

01:04:51.844 --> 01:04:52.932
Open the door!

01:04:57.763 --> 01:04:58.895
I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

01:05:00.548 --> 01:05:02.072
Is that all you're
going to do to her?

01:05:02.724 --> 01:05:04.074
You wanna do my job for me,
Paul?

01:05:04.726 --> 01:05:07.381
No, but I, I just-

01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:09.253
That's all I needed to do, Paul.

01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:11.211
I have my answer.

01:05:12.821 --> 01:05:14.475
And if you have any
respect for me whatsoever,

01:05:14.519 --> 01:05:15.999
you'll take that as
your answer too.

01:05:17.696 --> 01:05:23.745
Earlier you said um,
faith was about

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:27.575
what you couldn't see?
About what you believe?

01:05:30.665 --> 01:05:31.797
Well, I know what I believe.

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.320
Open the damn door.

01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:37.934
[footsteps]

01:05:40.545 --> 01:05:42.286
Marla, you are the finest woman

01:05:42.329 --> 01:05:43.983
the US military has ever seen.

01:05:44.462 --> 01:05:45.245
I'm not.

01:05:46.377 --> 01:05:48.292
It's such a goddam
shame you ended up

01:05:48.335 --> 01:05:50.163
with this pencil neck.

01:05:50.772 --> 01:05:51.556
[Marla scoffs]

01:05:55.473 --> 01:05:57.736
[footsteps]

01:06:00.086 --> 01:06:06.179
-[key clicking]
-[strange, eerie music]

01:06:07.615 --> 01:06:08.573
What the hell?

01:06:10.401 --> 01:06:14.187
The, the key it just, it
just disappeared.

01:06:14.231 --> 01:06:15.754
Paul, don't you dare.

01:06:15.797 --> 01:06:17.712
The door, the door just ate it.

01:06:17.756 --> 01:06:19.584
[Bob] That's a load of baloney,
Paul.

01:06:19.627 --> 01:06:20.846
[Marla] What did you do?

01:06:20.889 --> 01:06:22.979
I didn't do any, do you
see it on me anywhere?

01:06:23.022 --> 01:06:24.502
-Paul!
-Come on.

01:06:24.545 --> 01:06:25.633
I didn't do anything.

01:06:25.677 --> 01:06:27.070
Well, somebody better
do something.

01:06:27.896 --> 01:06:29.420
[Clive] Somebody...

01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:31.683
[ominous music]

01:06:31.726 --> 01:06:36.557
[Clive breathing]

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.865
Somebody is,

01:06:40.648 --> 01:06:44.652
going to do something.

01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:48.613
[Hildegard gasping]

01:06:48.917 --> 01:06:50.745
[Clive gasping]

01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:52.443
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, I, what?

01:06:57.578 --> 01:07:02.322
[gasping] Somebody is
going to

01:07:02.757 --> 01:07:06.587
kill... that... Nazi.

01:07:07.719 --> 01:07:09.068
Leiber Gott!

01:07:09.112 --> 01:07:10.417
-Clive--
-He's dead, right?

01:07:10.461 --> 01:07:11.853
-Clive?
-He's very dead.

01:07:12.898 --> 01:07:14.291
Well, he doesn't sound dead!

01:07:14.726 --> 01:07:17.555
[soft ominous music]

01:07:20.862 --> 01:07:23.213
Major...

01:07:26.564 --> 01:07:29.610
No, no, no... This, this
isn't, this isn't right.

01:07:30.959 --> 01:07:34.485
-Help, somebody help!
-Can anyone hear us?!

01:07:34.528 --> 01:07:36.574
Help! Help! Help!

01:07:36.617 --> 01:07:38.532
Ich muss hier raus,
verdammt nochmal!

01:07:39.794 --> 01:07:42.493
-Shut up...
-Can anyone help me?!

01:07:42.536 --> 01:07:44.408
Help! Help! Help!

01:07:44.451 --> 01:07:47.802
Outta the way!

01:07:48.151 --> 01:07:53.504
Shut up... shut up!

01:07:53.547 --> 01:07:54.418
[poker clangs on floor]

01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:57.421
Shut up!!!

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:05.733
Hock?

01:08:08.432 --> 01:08:13.611
Oh, what is going on?
[clearing throat]

01:08:20.747 --> 01:08:23.099
-Colonel?
-Be careful.

01:08:23.707 --> 01:08:26.928
[soft ominous music]

01:08:35.502 --> 01:08:36.068
Colonel?

01:08:40.377 --> 01:08:42.466
Kill... her.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.037
What?

01:08:50.648 --> 01:08:55.218
Kill... the... Nazi.

01:08:59.221 --> 01:09:01.136
[heavy breathing]
[clears throat]

01:09:07.273 --> 01:09:08.100
Okay.

01:09:09.188 --> 01:09:11.886
No! Nein!
No, no, no! Please.

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:13.888
-No, Paul.
-Please, please.

01:09:15.238 --> 01:09:16.108
You heard him.

01:09:17.935 --> 01:09:19.546
Oh, this is hell, this room...

01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:22.462
[soft ominous music]

01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:32.429
And we're locked in it until
one of us offs this Kraut.

01:09:33.865 --> 01:09:35.953
There, there must be
another way.

01:09:35.997 --> 01:09:38.216
Oh, I pray there isn't.

01:09:38.609 --> 01:09:39.740
There has to be.

01:09:40.263 --> 01:09:44.049
This, this is why we
are here tonight.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.835
Not for support, not to
save our friend.

01:09:47.879 --> 01:09:49.968
He was dead before we
even got here.

01:09:51.404 --> 01:09:53.798
Hock needs one of us to
get our hands red.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:58.455
Wait... we finish the séance.

01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:01.675
-What?
-Yeah, we, we finish the séance.

01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:03.547
We're, we're still in
another realm.

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:06.202
Hock said if we uncoupled
our hands during the séance,

01:10:06.245 --> 01:10:07.507
that the door would stay open.

01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:09.422
The door is locked, Marla.

01:10:09.466 --> 01:10:12.208
Not the parlor door! The door
to the other side, you know?

01:10:13.296 --> 01:10:14.993
But if we can close that door,

01:10:15.385 --> 01:10:19.476
whatever's keeping us in
here has to go back, correct?

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.304
That's insane.

01:10:21.347 --> 01:10:23.784
Our dead friend says
we have to kill

01:10:23.828 --> 01:10:25.743
a Kraut green grocer spy

01:10:25.786 --> 01:10:28.224
in order to unlock his
parlor room doors.

01:10:28.267 --> 01:10:30.487
Now that, that right
there is insane.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.274
Okay, you kinda, you
got a point.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.060
Give me the gun Archie.
I have to end this.

01:10:40.061 --> 01:10:40.888
No.

01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:46.851
Oh, you're protecting her now?

01:10:47.286 --> 01:10:48.853
-Yeah.
-Give me that goddam--

01:10:48.896 --> 01:10:50.289
-Paul.
-Oh, I don't believe

01:10:50.333 --> 01:10:51.943
we're even having this
conversation.

01:10:52.422 --> 01:10:54.598
I say we try the séance.

01:10:54.946 --> 01:10:57.818
Oh see, baby Bob
agrees with Marla.

01:10:58.428 --> 01:10:59.690
Big whopper of a surprise.

01:11:00.038 --> 01:11:01.779
Why don't you cram it, Paul?

01:11:02.997 --> 01:11:04.999
Nobody's gonna be
killing anyone.

01:11:06.087 --> 01:11:09.700
We try the séance and
if that doesn't work,

01:11:11.876 --> 01:11:14.487
we try something else,
we just keep trying.

01:11:14.531 --> 01:11:15.096
[chair slams]

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:19.884
Stay here.

01:11:23.322 --> 01:11:27.761
We try it, and if it doesn't
work, I give you the gun.

01:11:28.196 --> 01:11:29.850
What, what? No.

01:11:31.765 --> 01:11:33.071
You just stay right there.

01:11:34.986 --> 01:11:36.248
I'll be with you in a minute.

01:11:42.385 --> 01:11:43.386
Let's hope this works.

01:11:44.996 --> 01:11:46.519
Oh, God damn it.

01:11:46.563 --> 01:11:47.477
[chair scrapes across floor]

01:11:50.262 --> 01:11:54.135
But whatever happens,
still killing that Nazi.

01:11:54.701 --> 01:11:56.660
-But I--
-Don't.

01:12:07.105 --> 01:12:08.062
I don't know what to do.

01:12:10.456 --> 01:12:12.023
Well, neither did he.

01:12:12.937 --> 01:12:14.068
Yeah, and how did that turn out?

01:12:15.461 --> 01:12:18.595
Just tell him to go away.

01:12:19.596 --> 01:12:20.684
"Tell him to go away?"

01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:24.209
That's pure poetry.

01:12:25.384 --> 01:12:27.168
Uh, this is a message to
the spirit world.

01:12:30.041 --> 01:12:31.172
End this.

01:12:32.957 --> 01:12:35.699
What Hock started, we're
prepared to stop.

01:12:37.962 --> 01:12:43.663
-We're through with you.
-[Clive gasping]

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.012
Oh god.

01:12:46.405 --> 01:12:50.409
Our friend Clive
Hockstatter was hurting

01:12:51.889 --> 01:12:53.064
more than any good man should.

01:12:55.283 --> 01:12:57.373
And he wanted answers
to soothe his pain.

01:13:01.289 --> 01:13:04.031
He wanted to know that there
is something else out there,

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:08.209
and now he knows, we all know.

01:13:09.733 --> 01:13:11.125
So now this is over.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:18.132
It's not over.

01:13:18.872 --> 01:13:21.484
-Shut up, Hock.
-It is over!

01:13:23.486 --> 01:13:27.272
This madness is over this
war, this fucking war is over!

01:13:27.881 --> 01:13:30.275
Says who?

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:34.061
You don't belong here
anymore you, you coward!

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.499
You need to leave us alone!

01:13:37.543 --> 01:13:39.632
You're not gonna drag us
into the dark with you.

01:13:39.676 --> 01:13:43.244
That is my best friend
you're talking to there, Bob.

01:13:43.506 --> 01:13:47.988
Yeah? Well, he was a sad old
bitter knob, just like you!

01:13:48.032 --> 01:13:51.122
[Clive gasping]

01:13:52.645 --> 01:13:54.604
Hock never liked you Bob,

01:13:55.169 --> 01:13:56.432
and neither did Susie.

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:58.521
To hell with the both of them!

01:13:58.782 --> 01:14:00.131
-[light shattering]
-[group shouting]

01:14:01.698 --> 01:14:04.309
-What happened?
-The fuse blew.

01:14:06.137 --> 01:14:07.660
[Bob] Was there a power failure?

01:14:07.704 --> 01:14:08.835
[Archie] What do you think, Bob?

01:14:12.404 --> 01:14:15.233
Hock, turn the lights back on.

01:14:17.627 --> 01:14:19.716
[Clive] Go on, Susie.

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:25.156
[candles whooshing]

01:14:28.899 --> 01:14:30.553
-You...
-Susie?

01:14:32.946 --> 01:14:37.168
-You...
-Oh, Mein Gott.

01:14:38.386 --> 01:14:39.170
Gehe weg!

01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:44.392
[Susie] You did this,
all of this.

01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:48.484
You moved into my neighborhood.

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:54.054
You poisoned my city,
you poisoned me.

01:14:54.098 --> 01:14:56.230
No, stop it.

01:14:56.274 --> 01:14:57.841
[Susie] You killed me.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:01.671
-You crept into my house.
-What?

01:15:01.714 --> 01:15:04.456
-Pinned me down...
-That's a lie.

01:15:04.674 --> 01:15:08.895
And slit... my... wrists.

01:15:08.939 --> 01:15:11.985
Absolutely not, you crazy bitch!

01:15:12.029 --> 01:15:14.510
-[Susie shouting]
-[Hildegard gasping]

01:15:14.553 --> 01:15:17.948
[knife clattering]

01:15:17.991 --> 01:15:21.517
She's lying! She's mad!
She slit her own wrists!

01:15:22.735 --> 01:15:26.304
Go on, show them how you did it.

01:15:26.347 --> 01:15:29.394
Stop it, stop it!

01:15:30.308 --> 01:15:35.052
-[radio hissing]
-[Hildegard gasping]

01:15:39.622 --> 01:15:41.014
Did you do it?

01:15:42.755 --> 01:15:43.930
Did you kill Susie?

01:15:45.845 --> 01:15:49.545
No, no... I've, I've, I've
never killed anyone,

01:15:49.806 --> 01:15:51.372
let alone a sick woman.

01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:53.766
How about a sick woman
who found you out?

01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:58.379
Susie? Hock... let us go.

01:15:59.598 --> 01:16:01.992
[Clive exhaling]

01:16:06.779 --> 01:16:09.782
Hock, stop it.

01:16:16.093 --> 01:16:17.094
Stop it.

01:16:19.879 --> 01:16:21.272
Stop it!

01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:27.670
We're not gonna kill her, Hock.

01:16:28.018 --> 01:16:29.193
Yeah, speak for yourself.

01:16:30.063 --> 01:16:31.587
It's not happening, Paulie.

01:16:33.806 --> 01:16:35.199
I can't count the
number of times

01:16:35.242 --> 01:16:36.766
you made me kill for you, Hock.

01:16:39.551 --> 01:16:41.118
You aren't doing it again.

01:16:41.161 --> 01:16:42.293
You ain't doing it again!

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:46.123
-Archie!
-Jesus, please.

01:16:46.906 --> 01:16:48.299
Jesus, let me out.

01:16:50.562 --> 01:16:55.654
Send me to prison...
Send me to hell.

01:16:55.698 --> 01:16:57.134
Just let me out. Please.

01:16:57.874 --> 01:16:59.223
[lock clanking]

01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:08.014
[gunfire blasting] Hilfe!

01:17:19.939 --> 01:17:20.940
Close the door!

01:17:23.377 --> 01:17:28.121
-[gunfire blasting]
-[German children sobbing]

01:17:31.124 --> 01:17:33.866
[Archie gasping]

01:17:41.395 --> 01:17:46.923
That's it. I'm doing
this for Susie.

01:17:47.488 --> 01:17:49.447
-Paul, no!
-Kill her.

01:17:50.056 --> 01:17:52.189
-[Paul grunting]
-[Hildegard gasping]

01:17:52.232 --> 01:17:54.670
Let go, let go Paul.

01:17:55.279 --> 01:17:58.978
-Oh, to hell with you.
-[Hildegard gasping]

01:17:59.457 --> 01:18:04.984
-[Clive groaning]
-[soft ominous music]

01:18:07.552 --> 01:18:09.075
-Let her go, Paul!
-Whoa! Oh oh! Bobbo!

01:18:09.554 --> 01:18:11.121
[Hildegard gasping]

01:18:11.774 --> 01:18:14.690
Put the gun down,
nobody's killing anybody.

01:18:19.303 --> 01:18:22.698
-What a crock.
-[Hildegard gasping]

01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:26.832
You look away for one second,
Bob,

01:18:29.269 --> 01:18:31.010
I'm ripping that gun
from your hands

01:18:31.054 --> 01:18:32.620
and I'm shoving it down
to her throat.

01:18:32.664 --> 01:18:33.752
No, you're not.

01:18:33.796 --> 01:18:36.407
That snatch killed
Susie and Hock.

01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:39.366
I'm still fighting
this war Marla,

01:18:41.412 --> 01:18:43.196
and I'll take you down if
I have to, Arch.

01:18:43.936 --> 01:18:44.720
[Marla] Paul.

01:18:46.156 --> 01:18:48.724
I'll take everyone in this
room down if I have to.

01:18:49.333 --> 01:18:51.117
Are you listening to yourself,
huh?!

01:18:52.118 --> 01:18:53.729
Have you lost your Goddamn mind?

01:18:53.772 --> 01:18:55.034
We're your best friends!

01:18:55.078 --> 01:18:56.775
Calm down, Major.

01:18:58.429 --> 01:19:02.868
I swore an oath to protect
the United States of America.

01:19:04.174 --> 01:19:07.003
And no one in this
room is standing
