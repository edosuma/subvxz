Adult <i>Growing up, Mom and
Dad gave me "The Police Talk" </i>

00:05.931 --> 00:08.689
<i>about how to handle yourself
around cops. </i>

00:08.689 --> 00:10.068
<i>There was
a presidential election </i>

00:10.068 --> 00:11.965
<i>that created a racial divide,</i>

00:11.965 --> 00:14.241
<i>and there was a flu pandemic
that they said </i>

00:14.241 --> 00:16.896
<i>would kill a million people
around the world. </i>

00:16.896 --> 00:19.448
<i>But it was 1968.</i>

00:20.931 --> 00:23.586
<i>And that's the state
our country was in. </i>

00:23.586 --> 00:26.931
<i>Yeah, even the flu part.</i>

00:26.931 --> 00:29.137
<i>This was the year I turned 12,</i>

00:29.137 --> 00:32.068
<i>the age where you transfer
from boy to man. </i>

00:32.068 --> 00:33.827
<i>Or as the old folks
used to say, </i>

00:33.827 --> 00:36.689
<i>"When a boy
starts smelling himself." </i>

00:36.689 --> 00:38.241
<i>The previous summer's
race riots </i>

00:38.241 --> 00:41.793
<i>had caused the first wave of
"white flight" to the suburbs. </i>

00:41.793 --> 00:44.275
<i>As a kid,
I didn't understand all that. </i>

00:46.172 --> 00:48.034
<i>We had neighborhoods
that were just as safe </i>

00:48.034 --> 00:50.586
<i>as the ones they were
developing outside the city. </i>

00:50.586 --> 00:53.517
<i>There were teachers, veterans,
shop owners, </i>

00:53.517 --> 00:56.620
<i>all united by pride,
self-determination, </i>

00:56.620 --> 00:58.931
<i>and the right to spank
any kid caught outside </i>

00:58.931 --> 01:00.655
<i>after the street lights
came on. </i>

01:08.586 --> 01:11.448
Daddy's song!

01:11.448 --> 01:13.379
<i>My dad was a music professor
by day </i>

01:13.379 --> 01:15.448
<i>and a funk musician by night.</i>

01:15.448 --> 01:18.379
<i>In other words,
he was the baddest dude I knew. </i>

01:18.379 --> 01:20.655
Dean, I know you did
not just come into this
house without speaking.

01:20.655 --> 01:21.931
But I heard --
No "buts"!

01:21.931 --> 01:23.896
How about "Hello, Mama.
Hello, Daddy.

01:23.896 --> 01:25.172
How are you?"

01:25.172 --> 01:28.241
I heard Daddy's song
in Kwame's car.
You did?

01:28.241 --> 01:30.275
Dean, quit running your mouth
and turn on the radio!

01:30.275 --> 01:32.034
That's what I was trying --
Boy, move!

01:32.034 --> 01:32.931
Shh.

01:34.068 --> 01:36.206
Be cool.

01:36.206 --> 01:39.965
<i>"Be cool" was Daddy's catch-all
advice for every situation. </i>

01:43.517 --> 01:44.655
Be cool.

01:48.413 --> 01:50.206
Be cool.

01:54.413 --> 01:55.724
Be cool.

02:00.206 --> 02:02.448
We on the radio, baby.

02:02.448 --> 02:04.793
Girl, you better be excited.

02:04.793 --> 02:06.896
Your daddy's song
is on the radio!

02:11.206 --> 02:13.068
You were in the car
with your boyfriend?

02:13.068 --> 02:15.034
Dean was out after
the street lights came on.

02:15.034 --> 02:16.137
Hey!
Ms. Handy was out.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.310
I bet you Ms. Handy
saw her out there.

02:17.310 --> 02:18.586
Okay. You don't want Ms. Handy
seeing you!

02:18.586 --> 02:20.103
She gonna be talking about me
and my mothering.

02:20.103 --> 02:22.275
<i>This certainly wasn't
the first or last time </i>

02:22.275 --> 02:24.689
<i>emotions would run high
in our house, </i>

02:24.689 --> 02:27.137
<i>but whether we were
yelling or laughing, </i>

02:27.137 --> 02:29.689
<i>if you turned your head
just right, </i>

02:29.689 --> 02:32.620

02:41.448 --> 02:44.172
<i>One thing about being 12 that
hasn't changed over the decades </i>

02:44.172 --> 02:45.896
<i>is that it's around 12
where you figure out </i>

02:45.896 --> 02:48.034
<i>what your place is
in the world. </i>

02:48.034 --> 02:50.620
<i>But being in my family
made that hard. </i>

02:52.448 --> 02:54.344
<i>I'd never be as popular
as my sister </i>

02:54.344 --> 02:56.517
<i>or as athletic as my brother,</i>

02:56.517 --> 02:59.000
<i>as smart as my mom
or as bad as my dad. </i>

03:01.137 --> 03:03.137
<i>That's the problem
with being the youngest. </i>

03:03.137 --> 03:04.827
<i>By the time you're born,</i>

03:04.827 --> 03:07.793
<i>all the good parts
have been handed out. </i>

03:07.793 --> 03:10.758
Stupid play.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.689
<i>Really?</i>

03:12.689 --> 03:16.655
<i>But 12 was the age I was gonna
figure out what my bag was. </i>

03:16.655 --> 03:19.413
Dean, hurry up
or you'll miss the bus!

03:19.413 --> 03:22.551
<i>My parents had high standards
for us. </i>

03:22.551 --> 03:25.241
<i>I appreciate it now,
and so does my bank account, </i>

03:25.241 --> 03:27.827
<i>but at the time, man,
it was annoying. </i>

03:27.827 --> 03:29.241
Did you practice
like I told you to?

03:29.241 --> 03:31.137
Yes.
Yes, what?

03:31.137 --> 03:33.379
Yes, ma'am.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.068
Nu-uh-uh-uh.

03:35.068 --> 03:38.310
<i>Like how she insisted on giving
me an ashy elbows/lips </i>

03:38.310 --> 03:39.586

03:39.586 --> 03:41.655
<i>every morning
before I left the house. </i>

03:41.655 --> 03:44.655
Where are your glasses?
I told you, I don't need them.

03:44.655 --> 03:46.827
<i>Wearing glasses in junior high
was basically </i>

03:46.827 --> 03:49.620
<i>telling your cousin
to get a prom dress ready. </i>

03:49.620 --> 03:52.448
What'd I tell you
about bothering Bruce's
things while he's away?

03:52.448 --> 03:56.310
<i>"Away" was the word my mom used
instead of "in Vietnam." </i>

03:56.310 --> 03:58.655
Coach Long said I needed
a bigger glove.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.241
Man, I just bought you
that glove.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.137
Is Coach Long gonna pay me
for it?

04:02.137 --> 04:03.793
He's just looking out
for Dean.

04:03.793 --> 04:06.413
Right, right. Is that why
he made you Team Mom?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.793
Looking out for Dean?

04:07.793 --> 04:09.275
Or because
he's sweet on you?

04:09.275 --> 04:12.517
Stop it. He just did it
'cause we work together.
Hmm.

04:12.517 --> 04:14.517
Why would Coach
be sweet on Mama?

04:14.517 --> 04:16.379
Stay out of
grown folks' business.

04:16.379 --> 04:17.793
<i>"Stay out of
grown folks' business" </i>

04:17.793 --> 04:20.793
<i>was usually code for something
about money, sex, </i>

04:20.793 --> 04:23.689
<i>or the funny way Dad's studio
smelled after a rehearsal. </i>

04:23.689 --> 04:25.344
Let's go over analogies.

04:25.344 --> 04:27.344
The SATs
are important, Kim.

04:27.344 --> 04:30.551
This stupid test has nothing
to do with real life.

04:30.551 --> 04:32.310
You know, Bobby Seale
and H. Rap Brown

04:32.310 --> 04:33.551
didn't even
finish college.

04:33.551 --> 04:35.137
You're going to college.

04:35.137 --> 04:36.448
I'm sure the revolution's
gonna need

04:36.448 --> 04:38.172
a good dentist
or accountant.

04:40.551 --> 04:42.689
Besides, what kind of
music professor would I be

04:42.689 --> 04:44.344
if my daughter
didn't go to college?

04:44.344 --> 04:46.000
Bad enough my son
doesn't have rhythm.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.965
Hey!
Yet.

04:47.965 --> 04:50.413
My son doesn't
have rhythm <i>yet.</i>

04:50.413 --> 04:53.034
You got to get at least a 1050
to get into Auburn.

04:53.034 --> 04:54.310
Auburn?
Mm-hmm.

04:54.310 --> 04:56.310
Plenty of good black colleges
out there, too, you know.

04:56.310 --> 04:58.206
She can go to 'Skegee
like us.

04:58.206 --> 04:59.965
Better yet, Spelman.

04:59.965 --> 05:01.827
No boys.
It's a win-win.

05:01.827 --> 05:03.000
For who?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.413
Win. Win.

05:05.793 --> 05:07.275
<i>A lot of black folks
like my dad </i>

05:14.965 --> 05:17.310
<i>black accountant,
the black plumber, </i>

05:17.310 --> 05:19.793

we'd call "black regret." </i>

Gotta go!

05:42.655 --> 05:44.103
<i>Glasses or not,</i>

six inches of height </i>

<i>and six inches of hair
where it count. </i>

05:59.482 --> 06:00.758
<i>He was macho.</i>

06:00.758 --> 06:02.724
Hey, you got to tell me
about that party

06:02.724 --> 06:04.137
at Noddy's last night.

06:04.137 --> 06:05.448
Was it really
a makeout party?

06:05.448 --> 06:06.793
Come on now, man.

06:06.793 --> 06:08.413
You know it's not cool
to kiss and tell.

06:08.413 --> 06:10.586
Okay, but don't forget,
you were supposed to teach me

06:10.586 --> 06:11.620
how to French kiss
on a pillow.

06:11.620 --> 06:13.655
Shh!

06:13.655 --> 06:15.034
I'll tell you later.

06:16.551 --> 06:19.103
<i>That's our old school.</i>

06:19.103 --> 06:21.241
<i>Shut down because
of desegregation. </i>

06:21.241 --> 06:23.103
<i>But we still hung out
there sometimes, </i>

06:23.103 --> 06:25.896
<i>mainly to girls about girls
and then girls and -- </i>

06:25.896 --> 06:28.241
<i>Wow, I really got distracted.</i>

06:30.413 --> 06:32.551
<i>You know the girl that you see
for the first time </i>

06:32.551 --> 06:34.517
<i>and everything slows down?</i>

06:34.517 --> 06:36.206
<i>That was Lisa Jones.</i>

06:36.206 --> 06:38.551
<i>Everybody had a crush on her,</i>

06:38.551 --> 06:41.172
<i>but here comes my crush...</i>

06:41.172 --> 06:43.344
<i>Keisa Clemmons.</i>

06:43.344 --> 06:45.068
<i>She was perfect.</i>

06:47.310 --> 06:48.586
Hi, Dean.

06:48.586 --> 06:50.482
Thanks for letting me
borrow this.

06:50.482 --> 06:53.448
You were right.
It was great.

06:53.448 --> 06:56.275
<i>To this day, I can't smell
Vaseline and Tide </i>

06:56.275 --> 06:59.896

06:59.896 --> 07:02.586
Tell her you want to start
going together, man.

07:02.586 --> 07:04.620
Don't be scared.
I'm not scared.

07:04.620 --> 07:06.172
<i>I was so scared.</i>

07:06.172 --> 07:07.827
My plan
is to stay best friends

07:07.827 --> 07:09.724
until she realizes
she likes me.

07:09.724 --> 07:11.379
<i>And I was an idiot.</i>

07:11.379 --> 07:13.655
Hey, stop it!
Stop it!

07:13.655 --> 07:15.068
<i>Was this my opening?</i>

07:15.068 --> 07:17.241
<i>My chance to defend her honor
and win her heart? </i>

07:17.241 --> 07:18.241
<i>My --</i>

07:18.241 --> 07:20.137
You better
give my propers!

Stop!

07:21.241 --> 07:22.241
Say it!

07:22.241 --> 07:23.931
Man, she's tough.

07:23.931 --> 07:25.827
I know.

07:25.827 --> 07:27.724
I dig it.

07:43.620 --> 07:45.275
Hey, fellas!
What's happening?

07:45.275 --> 07:48.448
<i>Brad, the Pee Wee Reese
to my Jackie Robinson. </i>

07:48.448 --> 07:50.241
<i>That is if Pee Wee Reese
were Jewish </i>

07:50.241 --> 07:52.241
<i>and Jackie Robinson
couldn't catch a fly ball. </i>

07:52.241 --> 07:53.517
Take a guess.

07:53.517 --> 07:55.551
Dean's still afraid
to tell Keisa he likes her?

07:55.551 --> 07:56.758
Film at00.

07:56.758 --> 07:57.896
Shut up, Brad.

07:57.896 --> 08:00.620
What? I'm telling you,
she already knows.

08:00.620 --> 08:02.275
How?
Unless you blabbed.

08:02.275 --> 08:04.758
She can tell by the stupid way
you look at her.

08:04.758 --> 08:06.000
You look like
a wet dream.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.344
It's such a wet dream.

08:07.344 --> 08:10.000
I do not look
like a wet dream.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.482
<i>Okay, we clearly had no idea
what that meant yet. </i>

08:12.482 --> 08:13.965
<i>Still, good burn.</i>

08:13.965 --> 08:16.379
You guys have practice
today, too?
Yeah.

08:16.379 --> 08:18.620
Who do you think would win if
our teams played each other?

08:18.620 --> 08:19.827
We would.

08:19.827 --> 08:21.965
But we only play teams
on our side of town.

08:21.965 --> 08:24.689
Think about how boss it'd be
to have our teams meet.

08:24.689 --> 08:26.655
Yeah.
Your dad's the coach.

08:26.655 --> 08:27.758
He'll go for it, right?

08:27.758 --> 08:29.034
Uh, maybe.

08:29.034 --> 08:30.827
I mean,
he watches "I Spy."

08:30.827 --> 08:32.931
Cool. You ask your dad,
and we'll ask mine.

08:35.137 --> 08:37.517
A scrimmage against some
all-white team from across town?

08:37.517 --> 08:38.482
Hell, no.

08:38.482 --> 08:40.620
But our friend Brad's
on that team.

08:40.620 --> 08:41.793
We go
to the same school.

08:41.793 --> 08:43.137
We should be able
to play each other.

08:43.137 --> 08:45.000
Do us both a favor,
put all that energy

08:45.000 --> 08:47.620
in learning how to catch a fly
ball without your pants.

08:47.620 --> 08:48.896
<i>If a coach said that today,</i>

08:48.896 --> 08:51.000
<i>he'd have to go
to sensitivity training. </i>

08:51.000 --> 08:52.758
<i>At least that's what
they made me do </i>

08:52.758 --> 08:54.551
<i>when I cussed out
my son's team. </i>

08:54.551 --> 08:56.034
Hey, guys.

08:56.034 --> 08:58.413
I came to take the measurements
for the team jerseys.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.655
Mama!

08:59.655 --> 09:01.137
Tell Coach we should play
a scrimmage game

09:01.137 --> 09:02.310
against Brad's team.

09:02.310 --> 09:04.103
Brad's asking
his dad, too.

09:04.103 --> 09:05.862
Why would you want to play
with a bunch of white boys?

09:05.862 --> 09:08.172
Exactly.
Why does that matter?

09:08.172 --> 09:10.724
Oh, it doesn't to us.
But trust me, it will to them.

09:10.724 --> 09:13.655
How do you know
if you don't try?

09:13.655 --> 09:15.724
Isn't that what you're
always telling me?

09:19.172 --> 09:21.379
For what it's worth,
I met Brad's dad,

09:21.379 --> 09:22.793
and he's
our kind of people.

09:22.793 --> 09:24.103
That still don't mean
I want some whitey pitcher

09:24.103 --> 09:25.206
throwing
at our boys' heads.

09:25.206 --> 09:27.137
Well, let's not get to
calling names.

09:27.137 --> 09:29.517
<i>Never mind that there were
teams called the Redskins, </i>

09:29.517 --> 09:32.241
<i>Chiefs, and Savages
and no one batted an eye. </i>

09:32.241 --> 09:33.724
Look at it this way.

09:33.724 --> 09:36.379
We want our sons to learn
to compete with them now,

09:36.379 --> 09:38.103
or never learn
and then go out into the world

09:38.103 --> 09:39.482
feeling like
they're lacking --

09:39.482 --> 09:41.103
like we did?

09:44.275 --> 09:46.310
Okay, I'll talk to your friend's
dad and see what he says.

09:46.310 --> 09:47.655
Yes!
Alright!

09:47.655 --> 09:49.896
Alright, now --
now give me three laps.

09:49.896 --> 09:51.724
For -- For coming to practice
too early!

09:52.965 --> 09:55.206
Come on,
get -- get some laps in.

09:55.206 --> 09:57.241
Y'all walking?
Come on, hustle up!

10:00.586 --> 10:01.862
<i>Now that I'd figured out</i>

10:01.862 --> 10:04.206
<i>that my bag was being
"The Great Uniter," </i>

10:04.206 --> 10:05.862
<i>I couldn't wait
to get started. </i>

10:05.862 --> 10:08.551
Hey, Mark.
Uh, what's happening, Chad?

10:08.551 --> 10:09.965
How's it going, Quentin?

10:09.965 --> 10:12.758
Hey, Black Jesus,
mellow out, man.

10:12.758 --> 10:14.379
You're trying too hard.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.551
It's okay.

10:21.551 --> 10:24.241
My mom's
making me wear these.

10:24.241 --> 10:26.379
Pantyhose.

10:26.379 --> 10:28.448
Yuck.

10:28.448 --> 10:30.068
Yeah.

10:30.068 --> 10:31.344
Yuck.

10:31.344 --> 10:33.965
Anyway,
your glasses are cute.

10:33.965 --> 10:36.275
<i>She'd just basically said I
looked like Billy Dee Williams </i>

10:36.275 --> 10:37.793
<i>in my glasses.</i>

10:37.793 --> 10:40.379
<i>This was the perfect time
to tell her that I've loved her </i>

10:40.379 --> 10:43.931
<i>since I sat next to her on
the first day of first grade. </i>

10:43.931 --> 10:45.172
Keisa --

10:45.172 --> 10:47.379
Hey, Four Eyes!

10:47.379 --> 10:50.000
Can you look to my house
and tell me what's on the TV?

10:51.724 --> 10:54.620
<i>Now, no one in school knew
how old Michael Simms was. </i>

10:54.620 --> 10:57.034
<i>Some people said he had a son
at another school. </i>

10:57.034 --> 10:59.379
<i>Others said he'd already
done a tour in 'Nam. </i>

10:59.379 --> 11:01.000
<i>Bullies back then
benefited from us </i>

11:01.000 --> 11:02.758
<i>not having Google
to fact-check. </i>

11:02.758 --> 11:04.206
Shut up, Free Lunch!

11:04.206 --> 11:05.724
Yo mama on free lunch.

11:05.724 --> 11:07.344
Ooh.

11:07.344 --> 11:09.482
What's all the fuss
back there?

11:09.482 --> 11:11.931
Somebody said "yo mama."

11:13.896 --> 11:15.793
Now, that's something
that the black students do

11:15.793 --> 11:17.965
that the white students don't.

11:17.965 --> 11:21.172
You ought to be
like these three.

11:21.172 --> 11:23.310
Their parents send them here
to learn.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.655
Hey,
she's not prejudiced.

11:29.655 --> 11:32.241
<i>But was she?
In my memory, she was. </i>

11:32.241 --> 11:35.172
<i>But she also gave some of us
black students extra attention </i>

11:35.172 --> 11:37.068
<i>if she thought
we had potential, </i>

11:37.068 --> 11:39.241
<i>which may still
have been racist. </i>

11:39.241 --> 11:40.931
<i>I don't know.</i>

11:40.931 --> 11:42.172
<i>But bringing people together</i>

11:42.172 --> 11:44.000
<i>wasn't just
about the white people. </i>

11:44.000 --> 11:47.034
<i>It was also about black people
like Michael Simms. </i>

11:47.034 --> 11:48.965
<i>I knew I could reach him, too.</i>

11:48.965 --> 11:50.551
Ah!
Think you're white,
don't you?

11:50.551 --> 11:52.724
<i>I could not.
You talk white!</i>

11:52.724 --> 11:54.344
You act white!
Ah!

11:54.344 --> 11:56.586
You even brought a lunch box
to school like you white!

11:57.862 --> 11:59.517
<i>That last one confuses me
to this day. </i>

11:59.517 --> 12:01.137
Come on, man.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.551
Told you it was a dumb idea
to try to talk to him, Dean.

12:05.310 --> 12:07.482
Ah!
So dumb.

12:07.482 --> 12:09.448
<i>Who was I kidding?</i>

12:09.448 --> 12:11.896
<i>The world was always gonna be
full of Michael Simmses </i>

12:11.896 --> 12:14.034
<i>and white people
with lunch boxes. </i>

12:14.034 --> 12:16.517
<i>Nobody was gonna listen</i>

12:16.517 --> 12:18.310
What kind of present?

12:18.310 --> 12:19.862
I don't know.

12:19.862 --> 12:21.586
Maybe that pearl necklace

12:21.586 --> 12:23.413
I caught you staring at
at Parisians.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.241
Well, it's just one
royalty check, Bill.

12:27.241 --> 12:28.413
Be cool.

12:28.413 --> 12:30.448
There's gonna be more
where that came from, baby.

12:36.275 --> 12:37.862
What do you need, son?

12:37.862 --> 12:40.241
Just wondering if Mama told you
we're playing Brad's team

12:40.241 --> 12:42.586
from East Montgomery
for the first time.

12:42.586 --> 12:44.620
Why our boys gotta
play their team?

12:44.620 --> 12:47.379
It's the Barnstorming
Negro Leagues all over again.

12:47.379 --> 12:49.586
Figures Long
would be okay with this.

12:49.586 --> 12:51.310
Coach Long
was against it, too,

12:51.310 --> 12:53.068
but then Mama
talked him into it.

12:53.068 --> 12:56.793
I think it's a good idea, and
I'm proud of Dean for trying.

12:56.793 --> 12:58.137
Hmm.

12:58.137 --> 13:00.379
It doesn't matter.
He's not playing.

13:00.379 --> 13:01.724
But, Dad!
Nope.

13:01.724 --> 13:03.413
Too many good teams
to play over here

13:03.413 --> 13:04.620
and good parks, too.

13:04.620 --> 13:06.896
What's so bad --
Are you talking back?

13:06.896 --> 13:07.896
No, sir.

13:07.896 --> 13:09.275
Then you better
fix your face.

13:09.275 --> 13:11.482
Well, whether or not he plays,
I still have to go to the game.

13:11.482 --> 13:14.103
Right, because your office buddy
made you Team Mom.

13:14.103 --> 13:16.310
I never say anything
about your work friends.

13:16.310 --> 13:17.620
That's not fair,
and you know it.

13:17.620 --> 13:18.724
What's not fair?

13:18.724 --> 13:20.241
Stay out of
grown folks' business.

13:22.206 --> 13:23.827
No.

13:23.827 --> 13:25.137
Did you
just tell us no?

13:25.137 --> 13:26.517
Have you lost
your natural mind?

13:26.517 --> 13:27.931
Boy, what has
gotten into you?

13:27.931 --> 13:30.310
<i>I wanted to tell them
about the kids on the bus </i>

13:30.310 --> 13:31.620
<i>and the white kids at school</i>

13:31.620 --> 13:33.655
<i>and Michael Simms
and Mrs. Hodges </i>

13:33.655 --> 13:36.379
<i>and that Kim went in Mama's
purse and snuck out last night. </i>

13:36.379 --> 13:39.068
<i>But I realized it was
actually more than that. </i>

13:39.068 --> 13:42.034
<i>What came out surprised me
as much as it did them. </i>

13:42.034 --> 13:47.827
I feel different everywhere
I go, no matter who I'm around.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.310
And I know
I'll always be different.

13:50.310 --> 13:54.965
But when I'm with Cory and Brad
and we all feel different,

13:54.965 --> 13:59.482
I finally get to feel
the same as everybody else.

13:59.482 --> 14:01.034
That's why I want to play.

14:01.034 --> 14:02.275
<i>Brad would later tell me</i>

14:02.275 --> 14:04.000
<i>that trying to make
myself feel better </i>

14:04.000 --> 14:06.551
<i>by making everybody feel
as uncomfortable as me </i>

14:06.551 --> 14:09.241
<i>was the most Jewish thing
I'd ever done. </i>

14:09.241 --> 14:10.379
Fine.

14:10.379 --> 14:12.137
You two do
whatever you want.

14:15.379 --> 14:18.241
<i>That was the first time
I'd stood up to my dad </i>

14:18.241 --> 14:21.103
<i>and the first time I realized
just how scary it can be </i>

14:21.103 --> 14:22.586
<i>to get what you want.</i>

14:34.344 --> 14:36.482
Let's go!
Team captains!

14:43.896 --> 14:45.413
Come on.
Let's go.

14:45.413 --> 14:47.517
<i>When I saw me, Brad,
and Cory on that field, </i>

14:47.517 --> 14:48.793
<i>with kids from my neighborhood</i>

14:48.793 --> 14:51.620
<i>mingling with kids from
a world way across town, </i>

14:51.620 --> 14:54.206
<i>united by something
we all had in common, </i>

14:54.206 --> 14:56.172
<i>I was proud of what I'd done.</i>

14:56.172 --> 14:58.137
<i>It didn't even matter
who won the game. </i>

15:03.655 --> 15:06.000
<i>Now, I'd find out much later
that Michael was only there </i>

15:06.000 --> 15:07.206
<i>to steal Brad's bike,</i>

15:07.206 --> 15:09.965
<i>but at the moment,
it was validation. </i>

15:14.862 --> 15:16.413
<i>It's a trip,</i>

15:16.413 --> 15:19.137
<i>the little things that
you remember all your life. </i>

15:19.137 --> 15:21.896
<i>Your first hit,
your first kiss, </i>

15:21.896 --> 15:25.413
<i>the first time your dad
lets you know that he sees you. </i>

15:25.413 --> 15:26.931
<i>Well, I still hadn't had
the other two, </i>

15:26.931 --> 15:29.275
<i>but, boy, did that
third one feel good. </i>

15:40.310 --> 15:42.827
Hey,
he's not prejudiced.

15:42.827 --> 15:46.241
<i>Well, if he wasn't,
then the ball was. </i>

15:46.241 --> 15:47.965
Come on. Front of the box.
Watch the fastball!

15:47.965 --> 15:49.724
Back of the box!
Watch the curve!

15:51.413 --> 15:53.551
Front of the box!
Look fastball!

15:53.551 --> 15:55.758
Dean, back of the box.
Watch the curve.

15:55.758 --> 15:57.310
Front of the box.
Back of the box, Dean!

15:57.310 --> 15:58.517
Back of the box!
Scoot to the front, Dean!

15:58.517 --> 15:59.413
Dean!
Dean!

15:59.413 --> 16:00.896
Dean Jeremiah Williams!

16:00.896 --> 16:02.275
I don't know his whole --
Dean!

16:02.275 --> 16:03.758
Dean!
Dean!

16:03.758 --> 16:05.689
Strike!

16:05.689 --> 16:07.206
You'll get it
next time, son.

16:08.965 --> 16:11.103
Come in, Dean.
Stay deep.

16:11.103 --> 16:12.482
No, no, no, no.
C-Come in some.

16:12.482 --> 16:13.655
Stay deep, Dean.

16:13.655 --> 16:14.965
Come towards me.
Deep.

16:14.965 --> 16:16.103
This way.
Away from me.

16:16.103 --> 16:17.310
This way.
That way.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.344
Dean!

16:23.620 --> 16:25.724
Alright, now, hands up!
Weight back.

16:25.724 --> 16:26.793
Weight back,
hands up, Dean.

16:26.793 --> 16:28.172
You saying the same thing
I'm saying.

16:28.172 --> 16:29.482
Listen to your coach.
Weight back, hands up.

16:29.482 --> 16:31.241
No, no, no, hands up first.
That's not the same thing.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.620
Hands up first,
then weight back.
Weight back, hands up, Dean.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.551
Strike three!

16:36.793 --> 16:39.379
Bill, if you got a problem
with the way I coach, say so.

16:40.551 --> 16:42.137
Be cool.

16:42.137 --> 16:43.413
Be cool.

16:43.413 --> 16:44.586
I thought instead
of a new glove,

16:44.586 --> 16:45.965
maybe Dean just needed
better instruction.

16:45.965 --> 16:47.793
No. Well, listen, man.
This ain't no piano recital.

16:47.793 --> 16:49.379
So you stick
to the do-re-mi's

16:49.379 --> 16:50.655
and I'll stick
to the one-two-threes.

16:50.655 --> 16:52.241
That doesn't even make sense.
It just rhymes.

16:52.241 --> 16:54.103
Well, I could say the same thing
about your songs.

16:54.103 --> 16:55.965
Oh, so you raggin'
on my music now?

16:55.965 --> 16:57.827
Well, I may be a musician,
but I still struck you out,

16:57.827 --> 16:59.241
let's not forget.
You know what?

16:59.241 --> 17:01.103
That was in sixth grade, and I
didn't hit my growth spurt yet.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.655
"Yet."
Get the ball, Bill.

17:02.655 --> 17:03.758
You get the ball.
Get the ball, Bill.

17:03.758 --> 17:04.965
You get the ball, Long!
You get the ball!

17:04.965 --> 17:06.896
If I get the ball,
you ain't gonna touch it!

17:06.896 --> 17:08.310
This may not be
the right time,

17:08.310 --> 17:11.379
but, dude,
your sister is choice.

17:11.379 --> 17:12.793
Shut up, Brad.

17:12.793 --> 17:14.827
You know what?
I ain't scared of you no more.
Bill.

17:14.827 --> 17:16.000
What is wrong
with you two?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.344
You both know better
than to be out here

17:17.344 --> 17:20.000
showing your ass in front
of these white folks.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.551
<i>That was a universal rule</i>

17:21.551 --> 17:23.965
<i>that cut across all classes
of black people, </i>

17:23.965 --> 17:26.068
<i>but it was too late now.</i>

17:26.068 --> 17:27.620
We're so sorry.

17:27.620 --> 17:28.896
We just heard
what happened.

17:28.896 --> 17:30.379
Heard about what?

17:30.379 --> 17:33.000
Dr. King.
He...

17:34.896 --> 17:36.551
He was s-shot.

17:36.551 --> 17:38.896
What?
Where?

17:38.896 --> 17:42.000
In Memphis.
It -- It's all in the news.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.206
Is he --
They rushed him
to a hospital.

17:45.206 --> 17:49.172
We saw you all were upset,
and we --

18:09.965 --> 18:12.310
<i>The incident happened at
the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, </i>

18:12.310 --> 18:14.034
<i>where the reverend was staying,</i>

18:14.034 --> 18:16.379
<i>as he planned to march
later in the week. </i>

18:16.379 --> 18:18.827
<i>Now the entire country
awaits the update </i>

18:18.827 --> 18:20.827
<i>on Dr. King's status.</i>

18:20.827 --> 18:22.448
<i>We know he was admitted</i>

<i>shortly after00 p.m.
Central Standard -- </i>

18:25.241 --> 18:27.517
<i>Wait, this just in.</i>

18:27.517 --> 18:28.896
<i>Good evening.</i>

18:28.896 --> 18:30.758
<i>Dr. Martin Luther King,</i>

18:41.896 --> 18:44.413
<i>Officers also
reportedly chased... </i>

18:51.137 --> 18:52.689
Mama?

18:52.689 --> 18:54.310
Dr. King is dead.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.551
Adult <i>
I just couldn't understand</i>

19:01.551 --> 19:04.551
<i>what was so important
about folding those clothes. </i>

19:13.482 --> 19:15.586
He's gone, man!

19:19.551 --> 19:22.275
We should go
check on Ms. Handy.

19:22.275 --> 19:23.965
Yeah.

19:42.241 --> 19:43.965
<i>
Police report that the murder</i>

19:43.965 --> 19:46.620
<i>has touched off
sporadic acts of violence </i>

19:46.620 --> 19:49.206
<i>in the Negro section
of the city. </i>

19:51.379 --> 19:54.068
Adult <i>I didn't understand
a lot of what was going on, </i>

19:54.068 --> 19:56.275
<i>especially why when people
get really upset </i>

19:56.275 --> 19:57.758
<i>about something bad,</i>

19:57.758 --> 20:00.413
<i>they resort to destroying
their own things. </i>

20:00.413 --> 20:01.965
Sick and tired of this!

20:01.965 --> 20:03.620
<i>But something told me
that my friends </i>

20:03.620 --> 20:05.827
<i>were probably
just as confused as I was. </i>

20:05.827 --> 20:07.517
Why do they keep doing this
to us?!

20:08.551 --> 20:10.931
Nothing but
them ol' white folks.

20:40.827 --> 20:43.103
<i>Suddenly, the anger
I was seeing on the news </i>

20:43.103 --> 20:45.551
<i>made a little more sense,</i>

20:45.551 --> 20:50.448
<i>especially because it felt like
some things would never change. </i>

21:17.413 --> 21:18.896
<i>Everybody in my family</i>

21:18.896 --> 21:21.448
<i>plays that day over and over
in their minds. </i>

21:21.448 --> 21:25.000
<i>But for different reasons.</i>

21:25.000 --> 21:27.241
<i>For each of us, it felt
like the world around us </i>

21:27.241 --> 21:28.413
<i>had changed forever.</i>

21:36.896 --> 21:39.413
<i>But thankfully, for each of us,</i>

21:39.413 --> 21:42.206
<i>the world on the inside hadn't.</i>
