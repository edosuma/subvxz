02:52.578 --> 02:53.973
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.711
- Didn't know
when to expect you.

02:55.746 --> 02:57.416
- I got here
as soon as I could.

03:00.454 --> 03:03.653
It's good to see you.
- You, too.

03:03.688 --> 03:04.984
- The tree isn't
as bad as I thought.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.689
- Joey worked on it.

03:06.724 --> 03:08.262
He'll be back this afternoon.

03:08.297 --> 03:09.890
I'm making lunch, you hungry?

03:09.925 --> 03:12.464
No, I'm good, thanks.

03:12.499 --> 03:16.336
We, uh, had to move him
to the study, so...

03:16.371 --> 03:17.568
Okay.
Okay.

03:18.472 --> 03:20.274
I made up your room.
Thanks.

03:22.575 --> 03:24.311
Oh, Cal, this is Ace,

03:24.346 --> 03:25.510
from the hospital.

03:25.545 --> 03:26.973
- Hello, Cal.

03:27.008 --> 03:29.316
I am very sorry
about your father.

03:29.351 --> 03:30.878
I will do all I can for him.

03:30.913 --> 03:32.847
Okay, thanks. Um...

03:32.882 --> 03:34.915
I'm gonna drop my bag.

03:34.950 --> 03:36.049
- Yes, of course.

03:36.085 --> 03:39.293
Just let me know when you're
ready to come in to see him.

03:39.328 --> 03:40.624
Yeah, I will.
Okay.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.018
- My cousin Bambi
was in a coma once,

04:12.053 --> 04:14.493
she was in this
head-on collision.

04:14.528 --> 04:17.529
Anyway, she said that
while she was in the coma,

04:17.564 --> 04:19.795
she could float through
the quarters of the hospital,

04:19.830 --> 04:21.698
and that she saw
this one nurse...

05:28.162 --> 05:29.370
Hey, Mr. T.

05:33.574 --> 05:34.573
Hey, beauty.

05:41.010 --> 05:42.009
How you doing?

05:43.683 --> 05:44.682
Yeah.

05:45.982 --> 05:47.146
I missed you.

06:11.139 --> 06:12.512
Oh, Cal.

06:13.944 --> 06:16.010
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

06:16.045 --> 06:17.616
It's okay.

06:17.651 --> 06:19.079
I found the puzzle
in a closet,

06:19.114 --> 06:20.520
I hope you don't mind.

06:20.555 --> 06:21.983
No, make yourself at home.

06:25.087 --> 06:26.790
What are you listening to?

06:26.825 --> 06:28.528
Oh, uh...

06:28.563 --> 06:30.530
Brahms, I think.

06:30.565 --> 06:32.829
Classical music is what
most people ask for.

06:33.931 --> 06:35.535
My father hated
classical music.

06:36.637 --> 06:37.966
Okay.

06:38.001 --> 06:39.671
No, I mean, uh...

06:40.608 --> 06:41.706
Listen to whatever.

06:41.741 --> 06:42.740
Ah. Okay.

06:43.611 --> 06:44.610
Thank you.
- Hmm.

06:47.076 --> 06:48.845
Please, sit.

06:48.880 --> 06:49.879
Be with your father.

06:53.049 --> 06:56.116
You should probably wear
a mask, just to be safe.

06:57.086 --> 06:58.624
I can wait it in the kitchen.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.461
Okay.

07:00.925 --> 07:01.924
Thanks.

07:24.784 --> 07:25.816
Hey.

07:25.851 --> 07:26.850
Hey.

07:28.051 --> 07:29.919
Mom told me
about the tree, so...

07:29.954 --> 07:31.184
Yeah, thanks, I heard.

07:31.219 --> 07:32.922
Yeah, no problem.
Almost done.

07:34.761 --> 07:36.057
You, uh, seen him?

07:36.092 --> 07:37.597
Yeah, just now.

07:37.632 --> 07:38.730
It's a rough deal, huh?

07:39.964 --> 07:41.062
Painful to watch.

07:42.032 --> 07:44.065
Yeah.
- Hey, Joey.

07:44.903 --> 07:45.902
- Let me help you.

07:46.773 --> 07:47.838
Thank you.

07:47.873 --> 07:48.872
This is stuff
for the Goodwill.

07:48.908 --> 07:51.105
They're gonna come for
the treadmill tomorrow,

07:51.140 --> 07:52.205
and the other stuff.

07:52.746 --> 07:54.042
- Okay.

07:54.077 --> 07:55.208
See you Wednesday?

07:56.112 --> 07:57.177
Yeah.
Okay.

08:00.314 --> 08:01.522
Thank you.

08:07.860 --> 08:10.190
Uh, I'll come by later
and finish up.

08:12.194 --> 08:13.567
Be strong, huh?

08:13.602 --> 08:14.601
Yeah, thanks.

09:01.683 --> 09:02.748
- Hello, Cal.

09:02.783 --> 09:04.079
Uh...

09:04.114 --> 09:05.311
Oh! Uh...

09:05.346 --> 09:06.884
Sorry, just a sec.

09:06.919 --> 09:07.984
- Oh, no. Take your time.

09:09.757 --> 09:10.756
How was dinner?

09:11.660 --> 09:14.089
Uh, you know, dinner.

09:16.962 --> 09:17.961
So, uh...

09:19.426 --> 09:21.228
Ace, is that your real name?

09:23.771 --> 09:25.034
Is Cal your real name?

09:27.676 --> 09:30.677
Sort of.
It's short for, uh, Calvin,

09:30.712 --> 09:33.878
after Cal Ripken,
who broke the record

09:33.913 --> 09:36.683
for consecutive baseball games
played the year I was born.

09:36.718 --> 09:38.685
Oh, so you have a famous name?

09:38.720 --> 09:40.720
Well, to my father, at least.

09:44.352 --> 09:47.023
Ace is short for
Apiyo-ma-ka Nyadimo.

09:48.224 --> 09:49.861
Because nobody
in Montana, USA,

09:49.896 --> 09:51.929
can say Apiyo-ma-ka Nyadimo.

09:56.067 --> 09:58.133
Is your family here,
in Montana?

09:59.301 --> 10:00.707
Uh, no.

10:00.742 --> 10:01.741
They are at home.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.974
In Nairobi, Kenya.

10:08.750 --> 10:09.914
Well...

10:10.785 --> 10:12.917
Have a good night, Calvin.

10:13.315 --> 10:14.314
Good night.

10:16.417 --> 10:17.922
Apiya-ma-kan Wadimo.

10:19.860 --> 10:20.892
Not too bad.

11:04.938 --> 11:06.003
- Didn't think
I'd see you 'till tomorrow.

11:06.038 --> 11:07.070
- Ow!

11:09.107 --> 11:10.777
Cal!
I'm sorry.

11:12.407 --> 11:13.472
- You okay?

11:13.507 --> 11:14.814
Thought you were in bed.

11:14.849 --> 11:16.750
No, I can't sleep.

11:16.785 --> 11:18.917
I was just looking for this,
for the store.

11:19.821 --> 11:21.480
Mmm.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.482
If you're hungry,
there's, um, some fresh eggs.

11:23.517 --> 11:24.725
I just brought 'em in.

11:30.832 --> 11:32.392
So, um...

11:32.427 --> 11:33.525
Were you able
to talk to the store

11:33.560 --> 11:34.768
about going full-time?

11:36.002 --> 11:37.100
Yeah.

11:38.334 --> 11:40.103
They said maybe after
the beginning of the year,

11:40.138 --> 11:41.203
but not now.

11:43.845 --> 11:46.307
Everyone wants extra hours
now, for the holidays.

12:33.026 --> 12:34.993
So, I think,
more than likely, uh,

12:35.028 --> 12:36.127
when we finally
sell the ranch,

12:36.163 --> 12:38.590
it'll still leave enough to
cover the new medical bills.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.097
Uh, depending on
how much we get.

12:41.133 --> 12:42.495
And how long he lives.

12:44.367 --> 12:46.037
I'm assuming
Medicaid's kicked in

12:46.072 --> 12:47.368
for the in-home care, now?

12:47.403 --> 12:49.007
Most, but not all.

12:49.042 --> 12:50.140
And there's still
household stuff,

12:50.175 --> 12:52.175
Valentina's still coming
three days a week.

12:52.210 --> 12:53.539
- You have enough
to cover that?

12:54.608 --> 12:56.916
I can sell some things.

12:56.951 --> 12:59.314
- Remember, proceeds
from anything you sell

12:59.349 --> 13:01.283
technically belong
to the bankruptcy court.

13:01.318 --> 13:04.154
Yeah. What about my mom's car?
They were never married.

13:04.189 --> 13:05.452
Still, a good idea
to keep it quiet.

13:05.487 --> 13:06.618
You don't wanna
give his creditors

13:06.653 --> 13:07.927
anything to squawk about.

13:08.930 --> 13:11.161
You thought more
about that old horse?

13:11.196 --> 13:12.998
Gotta deal with it,
sooner or later.

13:14.001 --> 13:14.967
Um, yeah.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.068
I only ask, 'cause
the big animal vet from Butte

13:17.103 --> 13:18.168
came over to my place
this morning.

13:18.203 --> 13:19.873
Said he'd come by
and take care of it

13:19.908 --> 13:20.940
tomorrow morning,
before he leaves.

13:20.975 --> 13:22.007
Wait, tomorrow?

13:23.670 --> 13:24.603
Okay, yeah.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.638
It's the right thing to do,
he's an old horse.

13:26.673 --> 13:27.980
Lived a long life.

13:28.917 --> 13:30.246
Any other animals
left out there,

13:30.281 --> 13:32.446
might need looking at?
Uh, no, just the birds.

13:34.153 --> 13:36.318
- Hell, I'm real sorry
about all this.

13:36.353 --> 13:38.518
Crying shame,
Wade going out this way.

13:38.553 --> 13:40.025
Especially after
what he's been through,

13:40.060 --> 13:41.224
the last couple of years.

13:41.259 --> 13:43.259
With losing your mom and all.

13:43.294 --> 13:45.426
Most important thing though,
he's home.

13:45.461 --> 13:46.559
You got him home,

13:46.594 --> 13:48.165
where he wanted to be
in the end.

13:59.145 --> 14:00.144
Hey!

14:01.048 --> 14:02.047
Saw your car.

14:04.579 --> 14:06.051
Got a sec?

14:06.086 --> 14:08.020
Sure. What's up?

14:09.155 --> 14:10.484
Uh...

14:10.519 --> 14:12.959
My, uh... My mom
talk to you about hours?

14:13.423 --> 14:14.422
Yeah.

14:16.195 --> 14:17.260
She said they weren't gonna

14:17.295 --> 14:18.657
give her more time
at the store.

14:19.660 --> 14:21.396
Yeah, well,
it's actually less time.

14:22.201 --> 14:23.167
What do you mean?

14:23.202 --> 14:25.070
I mean, business sucks,
so they're cutting back.

14:25.105 --> 14:27.336
You know, with the holidays.
Yeah, she mentioned.

14:29.274 --> 14:30.603
Any chance
she could go back to...

14:30.638 --> 14:32.506
Joey, with the bankruptcy
and everything,

14:32.541 --> 14:34.343
even at three days a week,
it's a stretch.

14:39.449 --> 14:40.448
You know,

14:41.286 --> 14:42.923
whatever people say,

14:43.992 --> 14:45.255
he always did right by her.

14:46.093 --> 14:46.892
Keeping her on.

14:49.525 --> 14:51.393
What happens to the ranch
when he dies?

14:51.428 --> 14:52.559
It gets sold.

14:55.234 --> 14:56.563
I mean,
he borrowed against it.

14:56.598 --> 14:58.070
It's not gonna be up to us.

14:59.535 --> 15:01.436
You know, she lived on
that ranch a long time.

15:03.671 --> 15:05.176
Before Wade bought it.

15:05.211 --> 15:06.342
Before you and Erin.

15:09.545 --> 15:10.544
It's a part of her.

15:12.317 --> 15:13.987
I know,

15:14.022 --> 15:15.615
but there's nothing left now.

15:17.355 --> 15:18.354
For anybody.

15:32.733 --> 15:34.271
- Mama.

18:00.353 --> 18:01.649
Erin?

18:22.474 --> 18:24.276
I just wanna see him
one more time.

18:26.577 --> 18:27.576
Okay.

18:32.913 --> 18:34.451
How did you know
what happened?

18:38.490 --> 18:39.852
Valentina called me.

18:42.890 --> 18:44.659
You're in touch
with Valentina?

18:47.532 --> 18:49.169
How long's that
been going on?

18:51.404 --> 18:52.403
Since you left?

18:55.441 --> 18:56.605
The whole time?
Yeah.

18:59.478 --> 19:01.610
She doesn't know I'm here.

19:01.645 --> 19:03.381
But she's known
where you live?

19:04.582 --> 19:05.944
Where you've...
Where you've been?

19:08.949 --> 19:10.256
Your phone number?

19:12.722 --> 19:14.821
Like I said, I just wanna
see him one more time.

19:16.693 --> 19:18.297
I'm leaving tonight, okay?

19:22.534 --> 19:23.665
Um...

19:25.801 --> 19:27.372
Give me a sec.

20:07.876 --> 20:08.875
- Erin?

20:28.831 --> 20:29.830
Erin?

20:31.097 --> 20:32.338
He's not up here.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.307
He's dead, isn't he?

20:34.342 --> 20:35.869
No.

20:35.904 --> 20:37.904
He died before I got here.
No.

20:39.677 --> 20:40.676
Erin!

20:44.044 --> 20:46.385
Oh, miss. I'm sorry.

20:47.421 --> 20:49.080
Who are you?
Erin, this is Ace.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.719
He's taking care of Dad.

20:52.360 --> 20:53.722
So, where is he?

20:53.757 --> 20:55.724
In the study.
Alone?

20:56.925 --> 20:58.397
You can leave him alone?

20:58.432 --> 21:00.795
Uh... He's not going anywhere.

21:02.029 --> 21:03.567
Take a breath, all right?

21:29.562 --> 21:31.925
It's okay, you can go inside.

21:38.901 --> 21:40.472
You'll want to wear a mask,

21:42.410 --> 21:44.344
just to be safe.
Right.

21:49.516 --> 21:50.548
- Would you like some

21:50.583 --> 21:52.385
privacy with your father?
- No.

21:52.420 --> 21:54.046
I can wait just here...
- No, please.

21:54.081 --> 21:55.520
Don't leave me alone with him.

21:55.555 --> 21:56.818
- Yes, okay.

22:08.832 --> 22:10.535
- Is he completely
brain dead?

22:10.999 --> 22:12.438
- No.

22:12.473 --> 22:14.165
Not brain dead.

22:14.200 --> 22:17.707
The stroke has left him
unconscious, in a coma.

22:23.715 --> 22:25.011
- Can he hear me,
right now?

22:26.146 --> 22:27.387
- Probably not.

22:29.952 --> 22:32.150
His brain
continues to function

22:32.988 --> 22:34.493
to keep his body alive.

22:35.892 --> 22:37.958
But it is very badly damaged.

22:46.507 --> 22:47.539
- He looks asleep.

22:49.235 --> 22:50.641
Like he might wake up.

22:52.777 --> 22:54.942
- No, he will not wake up.

23:01.687 --> 23:03.951
Erin, are you okay?

23:03.986 --> 23:06.052
Yeah, I...

23:16.834 --> 23:18.438
She's been away a long time.

23:19.936 --> 23:21.133
It's never easy, Cal.

23:22.708 --> 23:23.707
Yeah.

23:58.678 --> 24:00.106
I just wasn't expecting him

24:00.141 --> 24:01.844
to be so not himself,
you know?

24:03.947 --> 24:05.177
Shrunken and pathetic.

24:06.917 --> 24:07.949
Yeah.

24:09.150 --> 24:10.787
He's definitely not himself.

24:14.155 --> 24:17.057
But it was the car
accident too, with Connie.

24:17.092 --> 24:20.698
You know, so he had kind of
a two-year running start,

24:20.733 --> 24:21.864
even before the stroke.

24:23.637 --> 24:25.571
God!

24:25.606 --> 24:27.837
How is it that I'm feeling
pity for him, right now?

24:31.645 --> 24:33.073
I think I should go.

24:33.108 --> 24:35.075
Yeah, I'm gonna
just wait at the airport.

24:35.110 --> 24:36.142
It's just
a couple hours, so...

24:36.177 --> 24:37.308
Really? You just got here.

24:37.343 --> 24:38.650
- No, no, this is better.

24:38.685 --> 24:39.783
Stay the night, at least.

24:44.856 --> 24:46.119
- Damn it.

24:46.154 --> 24:47.758
Damn it.
If you're not Verizon,

24:47.793 --> 24:49.122
you won't get
much of a signal.

24:54.734 --> 24:56.261
You're really leaving,
just like that?

24:57.704 --> 24:58.703
Really?

25:03.776 --> 25:06.139
Here, just use mine.

25:07.274 --> 25:08.911
I can Venmo you.
Don't worry about it.

25:35.104 --> 25:37.170
You're still doing business
with this sleazeball?

25:37.909 --> 25:39.073
He was worse than Dad.

25:43.849 --> 25:44.848
- Hey.

25:45.983 --> 25:46.982
It's fine.

25:48.953 --> 25:50.282
Yeah, tomorrow's still good.

25:54.387 --> 25:55.661
Hey.

25:56.994 --> 26:00.193
Um, I'm leaving, so thank you.

26:01.064 --> 26:02.261
Sorry about before.

26:04.034 --> 26:05.935
It was very nice to meet you,
Miss Erin.

26:13.879 --> 26:14.878
Um...

26:16.783 --> 26:18.178
I'm sorry, what'd you ask me?

26:20.248 --> 26:22.754
His regular vet
is Dr. Preston.

26:24.450 --> 26:25.724
Yeah,- 00's fine.

26:27.090 --> 26:28.089
Bye.

26:29.224 --> 26:30.223
Who's the vet for?

26:31.226 --> 26:32.357
Um...

26:32.392 --> 26:33.391
For Mr. T.

26:34.196 --> 26:35.195
He's still alive?

26:36.033 --> 26:37.032
Yeah.

26:37.870 --> 26:38.869
Erin!

26:51.818 --> 26:54.082
- Hey, yeah.

26:55.723 --> 26:56.821
Hi.

26:58.858 --> 27:00.253
Hi, it's okay.

27:00.288 --> 27:02.695
It's okay, Mr. T.

27:03.929 --> 27:05.060
Hi, beauty.

27:06.294 --> 27:07.293
Hi.

27:08.197 --> 27:10.032
Been a long time, hasn't it?

27:11.101 --> 27:12.232
Yes, it has.

27:14.434 --> 27:15.433
Hi.

27:19.109 --> 27:20.944
I can't believe
he's still alive.

27:22.750 --> 27:23.749
He must be...

27:24.378 --> 27:25.377
- Twenty-five.

27:26.446 --> 27:27.984
Same as you, remember?

27:30.120 --> 27:32.120
You're still such a lover,
aren't you?

27:43.837 --> 27:45.001
Hey.

27:45.399 --> 27:47.707
Hi, Mr. T. Hi.

27:48.336 --> 27:49.335
Hi.
- Hey.

27:56.443 --> 27:57.948
Erin, why don't you stay?

27:59.116 --> 28:00.445
Really, cancel the ride.

28:00.480 --> 28:02.249
You just got here.
No.

28:04.121 --> 28:05.219
I should go.

28:23.404 --> 28:25.778
What was that about, the vet?

28:25.813 --> 28:27.340
Is there something wrong
with Mr. T?

28:28.849 --> 28:29.848
Um...

28:30.851 --> 28:32.950
No. No, nothing's
wrong with him.

28:39.255 --> 28:40.760
We're gonna put him down.

28:42.555 --> 28:44.357
What?
It's just what has to happen.

28:44.392 --> 28:47.195
He's old, and he doesn't
have so much time left.

28:48.462 --> 28:49.901
And there's not gonna be
anywhere for him

28:49.936 --> 28:51.067
after the ranch gets sold,
I mean...

28:51.102 --> 28:52.101
So, you're just
gonna kill him?

28:53.874 --> 28:55.808
Well, what do you suggest?

28:55.843 --> 28:57.238
He's not living a life here,
anyway.

28:57.273 --> 28:58.910
I mean, he's...

28:58.945 --> 29:00.813
No one's around
to exercise him.

29:00.848 --> 29:02.276
His arthritis
is getting so bad, that...

29:02.311 --> 29:04.443
Right, yeah, so I know.
Let's just kill him then.

29:04.478 --> 29:06.049
Fuck, Erin.

29:07.888 --> 29:10.053
He's at
the end of his life.

29:11.485 --> 29:12.957
It's the right thing to do.

29:15.489 --> 29:17.027
The big animal guy from Butte

29:17.062 --> 29:18.424
happened to be around, so...

29:20.934 --> 29:22.296
He's coming by tomorrow.

30:00.468 --> 30:01.467
Erin!

30:09.279 --> 30:10.278
Erin!

30:41.674 --> 30:43.476
- Yes, that sounds good.

30:43.511 --> 30:44.983
Shit.

30:45.018 --> 30:46.248
You're breaking up, but yes.

30:46.283 --> 30:48.547
Same flight,
same time tomorrow.

30:48.582 --> 30:50.483
Sure, fine. I'm fine
with the change fee.

30:51.123 --> 30:52.584
Hello?

30:52.619 --> 30:54.190
Hello?

30:54.225 --> 30:56.192
Damn it!
- What are you doing?

30:56.227 --> 30:58.128
I'm changing my flight.
Why?

30:58.163 --> 30:59.261
Because if you're
gonna kill Mr. T,

30:59.296 --> 31:00.361
I'm gonna be there with him.

31:00.396 --> 31:01.967
Erin, there's no point.

31:02.002 --> 31:03.133
Yeah, well,
I've made up my mind.

31:03.168 --> 31:04.299
I'm gonna be there with him.

31:06.369 --> 31:07.973
So, really,
there's no service anywhere?

31:08.635 --> 31:10.173
Um...

31:10.208 --> 31:12.208
Up by the gate,
that works sometimes.

31:21.681 --> 31:22.680
Hello?

31:22.716 --> 31:25.683
Yes, I was just on the phone
with another operator.

31:25.718 --> 31:27.619
I'm trying to book
a flight for tomorrow.

31:27.654 --> 31:29.588
It's the exact same flight
that I was on today,

31:29.623 --> 31:32.998
but I just need to book
for tomorrow, please.

31:50.413 --> 31:51.984
- Valentina's
gonna be here tomorrow.

31:52.547 --> 31:53.612
- Have you told her?

31:55.319 --> 31:56.450
About Mr. T?

31:56.485 --> 31:58.419
Uh, no.

31:58.454 --> 32:01.620
Um, it only came together this
morning, after I met with Don.

32:03.096 --> 32:04.295
Maybe you ought to?

32:04.331 --> 32:07.197
Not everyone can handle this
sort of thing as well as you.

32:11.269 --> 32:12.334
Okay, I'll tell her.

32:17.374 --> 32:19.671
I mean, what is all this
still doing here?

32:22.511 --> 32:23.675
You know, I'm good.

32:23.710 --> 32:25.677
I can finish this, thanks.

32:25.712 --> 32:26.711
Okay.

32:28.517 --> 32:29.780
Um...

32:29.815 --> 32:31.617
You can use the bathroom
in the hall, I'll use Dad's.

32:31.652 --> 32:32.651
Okay.

32:34.655 --> 32:35.654
Good night.

33:36.552 --> 33:37.617
Hi.

33:41.524 --> 33:42.523
Hey.

33:43.130 --> 33:44.129
Hi.

33:56.407 --> 33:57.406
You're okay.

34:19.595 --> 34:20.792
What happened?

34:20.827 --> 34:22.167
What's wrong?

34:23.170 --> 34:24.829
I'm taking Mr. T back with me.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.139
Back where?

34:28.307 --> 34:29.306
To New York.

34:33.444 --> 34:34.542
You live in New York?

34:35.611 --> 34:37.314
Upstate, yeah. Focus.

34:38.350 --> 34:39.646
I'm not gonna
let you kill him.

34:40.616 --> 34:42.418
I'm taking him home with me.

34:42.453 --> 34:45.190
Erin, I'm not killing him.
Yes, you are.

34:45.225 --> 34:46.785
That's exactly what
you're doing, it's murder.

34:48.954 --> 34:50.294
How would you
even get him there?

34:50.329 --> 34:52.131
I mean, can you afford that?

34:53.497 --> 34:54.793
Boarding, feed?

34:54.828 --> 34:55.893
I can figure it out.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.304
You really think
this is right?

35:03.606 --> 35:04.770
It's exactly what it is.

35:05.443 --> 35:06.442
It's right.

35:07.412 --> 35:08.708
It's the right thing to do.

35:10.811 --> 35:12.481
For him, to be there for him.

35:12.978 --> 35:14.186
Right?

35:18.654 --> 35:19.653
Good night.

36:11.476 --> 36:12.607
- I'm sorry.

36:13.676 --> 36:14.675
It's okay.

36:17.042 --> 36:18.250
- I'm sorry.

36:18.945 --> 36:21.319
I know I said I wouldn't come.

36:21.354 --> 36:22.353
- It's okay.

37:00.954 --> 37:01.953
I'm sorry.

37:05.563 --> 37:06.760
I don't understand.

37:07.895 --> 37:10.434
I gave her my word,
I wouldn't tell you.

37:11.569 --> 37:13.470
But you knew
what I was going through.

37:15.100 --> 37:17.507
How much I missed her,
how hard I tried to find her.

37:18.477 --> 37:19.641
It broke my heart.

37:20.644 --> 37:21.643
And yet.

37:25.011 --> 37:26.879
All those nights
you stayed up with me.

37:28.487 --> 37:29.519
I promised.

37:43.799 --> 37:44.732
She wants to take Mr. T

37:44.767 --> 37:46.734
back to New York with her.

37:48.133 --> 37:49.737
I heard.

37:49.772 --> 37:51.871
It's insane.
Maybe.

37:51.906 --> 37:53.840
You don't think so?

37:53.875 --> 37:56.414
I think she doesn't know
how to make the pain go away.

37:58.451 --> 37:59.912
But maybe this, she can do.

38:15.402 --> 38:16.995
- Hey. Can you hear me?

38:17.030 --> 38:18.766
Great, okay.
Yeah, I'm just trying to...

38:18.801 --> 38:20.031
It's... It's a family thing,

38:20.066 --> 38:21.802
so I kinda have to be here,
you know?

38:23.036 --> 38:24.541
Yes, I'm aware.

38:26.479 --> 38:27.709
Okay, don't yell!

38:28.547 --> 38:29.612
Thank you.

38:30.615 --> 38:31.713
No, I...

38:31.748 --> 38:33.517
Yes, I'll try
to cut it shorter,

38:33.552 --> 38:35.112
but, I figure probably a week.

38:53.770 --> 38:56.936
Yeah, yes, so, uh, the baby
carrots and the radishes,

38:56.971 --> 38:58.036
if you still have them.

38:58.071 --> 38:59.642
Both the red
and the golden beets,

38:59.677 --> 39:01.677
and everything else
is the same as last week.

39:02.581 --> 39:03.811
Yes, great.

39:03.846 --> 39:05.109
Thank you, bye.

39:07.146 --> 39:09.454
I tried getting on the Wi-Fi,
but there's a password now?

39:09.489 --> 39:10.950
Oh, yeah.
And?

39:10.985 --> 39:13.689
Um, it's Libby, capital "L."

39:14.890 --> 39:16.186
Libby, for real?

39:16.221 --> 39:17.858
He chose it.
Of course he did.

39:17.893 --> 39:19.629
You can use my computer...
No, it's fine.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.598
You called off the vet?

39:22.865 --> 39:23.897
Yep.

39:24.570 --> 39:25.635
Good.

39:40.586 --> 39:41.750
Okay, yep.

39:42.621 --> 39:43.851
All right.
- Good.

39:43.886 --> 39:45.556
Just place it there.
Okay.

39:50.695 --> 39:51.892
- About half
of the 200 acres

39:51.927 --> 39:53.058
go south from there.

39:53.093 --> 39:54.829
The eastern boundary's
the river.

39:55.667 --> 39:56.699
It's quite a piece of land.

39:56.734 --> 39:58.195
Yeah.

39:58.230 --> 40:01.099
We used to raise cattle,
but not really.

40:01.134 --> 40:04.069
My dad liked the whole idea
of it, but he was a lawyer,

40:04.104 --> 40:05.708
so you know,
we had a foreman.

40:07.107 --> 40:08.206
Still a couple
dozen apple trees

40:08.242 --> 40:10.647
in the orchard, back there.
You want me to take you?

40:10.682 --> 40:12.484
Yeah, that'd be great.

40:12.519 --> 40:14.079
- My mom used to keep
bees back there, too,

40:14.114 --> 40:16.180
but I don't think there
are many of them left.

40:16.215 --> 40:18.050
- Wait, wait,
you're kidding right?

40:18.085 --> 40:19.953
Well, I have like
three other options

40:19.988 --> 40:22.890
that are way cheaper
than that, so...

40:24.861 --> 40:26.025
Need a hand?
- Uh-huh.

40:29.294 --> 40:30.997
Yeah, you know what?

40:31.032 --> 40:33.197
Um, actually,
just forget it, thanks.

40:33.232 --> 40:34.264
So, three bedrooms,
three baths...

40:34.299 --> 40:35.573
- Yeah, I get it.

40:35.608 --> 40:36.541
I just... Um, yeah, bye.

40:36.576 --> 40:37.839
And with a new roof
about five years back.

40:37.874 --> 40:39.775
Oh, that's meaningful.

40:41.581 --> 40:42.580
That's the garage.

40:43.209 --> 40:45.110
It only takes one car.

40:45.145 --> 40:47.244
- More than
a lot of ranches.

41:23.084 --> 41:25.150
- There is still
blood circulating,

41:25.185 --> 41:28.087
and neurological activity.

41:28.122 --> 41:33.059
The muscles and the tendons,
they feel and react.

41:33.094 --> 41:35.831
And perhaps
communicate something

41:35.866 --> 41:39.230
to whatever being still
resides in your father's body.

41:47.680 --> 41:48.745
Would you like to help me?

41:50.683 --> 41:52.980
Here.
Uh...

41:53.015 --> 41:55.081
No, um, I don't know how.
Trust me.

41:55.116 --> 41:56.654
No training required.

42:01.188 --> 42:04.321
Um... Should I?
No, no mask.

42:04.356 --> 42:06.191
You've been here
long enough, it's okay.

42:15.235 --> 42:19.072
- Okay. Place your hand
right there.

42:24.244 --> 42:25.980
Okay, place this one here.

42:27.753 --> 42:29.214
Can you feel his pulse
in your hands?

42:30.349 --> 42:31.920
I don't think so.

42:31.955 --> 42:33.856
Hold him lightly here,
around the ankle.

42:36.157 --> 42:37.255
Yes, like that.
Okay.

42:37.290 --> 42:39.158
By the bone,
as lightly as you can.

42:51.271 --> 42:53.744
Good.

42:53.779 --> 42:56.340
And now, can you feel
your own pulse there, too?

43:01.314 --> 43:02.654
For me,

43:05.857 --> 43:08.121
when a person who has come
to a place like this,

43:09.289 --> 43:12.895
alive, but in a way
we don't understand,

43:14.327 --> 43:15.931
that rhythm you're feeling,

43:17.165 --> 43:19.704
it can be like a conversation.

43:25.239 --> 43:26.876
- What are you doing?

43:26.911 --> 43:29.010
Um... Helping Ace.

43:32.851 --> 43:34.279
- I need to talk
to you for a minute.

43:34.952 --> 43:35.984
Please.

43:44.027 --> 43:45.455
- Um...

43:45.490 --> 43:47.424
I found a truck and a trailer,

43:47.459 --> 43:49.998
but it's up north near
Browning, at the reservation.

43:50.033 --> 43:51.230
Valentina hook that up?

43:51.265 --> 43:53.001
- Nope, Craigslist.

43:53.036 --> 43:54.332
- You're buying
a truck and trailer?

43:54.367 --> 43:56.334
- Mmm-hmm.
- To take back to New York?

43:56.369 --> 43:58.237
- Yup.
- Why?

43:58.272 --> 44:00.811
- Because you wanna
kill Mr. T, and I don't,

44:00.846 --> 44:03.077
so, I need to figure out a way
to get him back home with me.

44:03.112 --> 44:05.178
And I just need you to
drive me there, tomorrow.

44:05.213 --> 44:06.344
- It's fucking
freezing out there!

44:06.379 --> 44:07.444
- Jesus, Cal!

44:07.479 --> 44:08.951
Okay, fine.
I'll drive you.

44:10.515 --> 44:12.020
- Thank you.

44:27.433 --> 44:28.740
Did you hear all that?

44:29.171 --> 44:30.236
Not all.

44:47.552 --> 44:49.387
Mr. T is the old horse
in the barn?

44:50.522 --> 44:51.730
Yeah.

44:52.865 --> 44:54.392
He must be
very special to her.

44:56.066 --> 44:58.000
She wants to take him back
to New York.

44:59.971 --> 45:01.531
Her horse, I understand.

45:01.566 --> 45:03.005
No, not hers.

45:04.943 --> 45:06.470
I mean, Mr. T was ours.

45:06.505 --> 45:07.504
Hmm.

45:12.379 --> 45:13.851
Erin had a horse
called Pepper.

45:15.019 --> 45:16.953
Pepper and Mr. T.

45:16.988 --> 45:17.987
- Yeah.

45:21.025 --> 45:22.893
Pepper died
the night she left.

45:24.556 --> 45:26.094
Seven years ago.

45:30.100 --> 45:31.264
You must have been thinking

45:31.299 --> 45:33.134
something was up with her,
yesterday.

45:33.169 --> 45:35.235
Yes, I...

45:35.270 --> 45:38.469
I could see she was agitated
with your father.

45:40.110 --> 45:41.912
- Yeah, she was agitated.

45:45.313 --> 45:47.049
It was our father
who killed Pepper.

45:53.585 --> 45:57.026
I don't think
I can do that anymore.

45:57.061 --> 45:59.556
Uh, yes, no, of course.
No problem.

45:59.591 --> 46:01.096
Thank you for your help.

46:09.172 --> 46:13.339
I just can't believe
she came back like this, now.

46:15.343 --> 46:17.178
She didn't just leave here...

46:19.050 --> 46:20.852
Seven years ago,
she ran away.

46:23.021 --> 46:24.119
From him.

46:26.288 --> 46:28.090
She wrote this article
in the school paper,

46:28.125 --> 46:29.553
about what a slimy lawyer
he was

46:29.588 --> 46:32.490
for helping cover up
the toxic mess at the mine.

46:32.525 --> 46:35.163
And then this TV network
got hold of it,

46:35.198 --> 46:36.934
and everything just went nuts.

46:38.399 --> 46:40.938
I mean, she...

46:40.973 --> 46:42.401
She probably
shouldn't have done it.

46:44.108 --> 46:45.503
It was humiliating for him.

46:52.248 --> 46:53.918
But what he did to her...

46:56.615 --> 46:59.451
I mean, he'd hit us before.

46:59.486 --> 47:01.893
Not like super violent
or anything, or all the time,

47:01.928 --> 47:04.060
but he was that kinda guy.

47:04.095 --> 47:05.996
And the thing is,
she's sort of like him.

47:08.165 --> 47:09.593
Not the violent part,

47:11.366 --> 47:12.530
but, temperamentally.

47:14.941 --> 47:17.073
All that fire
in their bellies,

47:17.108 --> 47:19.075
and how smart
and quick they both are.

47:26.579 --> 47:27.886
Could you, um...

47:30.286 --> 47:31.285
Yeah.

47:36.556 --> 47:37.621
Thank you.

47:45.972 --> 47:47.972
We have different moms,
Erin and I.

47:49.074 --> 47:51.041
Hers died
while she was being born.

47:54.739 --> 47:56.310
And that was kind of it,
for him.

47:57.610 --> 47:59.445
He hired my mom
to help take care of Erin,

47:59.480 --> 48:00.479
and then...

48:02.747 --> 48:04.285
you know, I came along.

48:06.751 --> 48:08.520
But it wasn't the same
with Connie.

48:09.391 --> 48:10.489
My mom.

48:12.361 --> 48:15.098
Not like it was with Libby.

48:15.133 --> 48:17.628
<i>And Erin could feel his</i>
<i>distance too, you know?</i>

48:19.599 --> 48:21.269
<i>Everyone could,</i>
<i>it was obvious.</i>

48:23.504 --> 48:25.504
<i>Maybe that's why</i>
<i>she held me so close.</i>

48:29.081 --> 48:30.575
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>we were always together.</i>

48:33.217 --> 48:34.282
<i>Inseparable.</i>

48:43.689 --> 48:45.293
I saw what happened
that night.

48:48.595 --> 48:49.660
What he did to her.

48:52.038 --> 48:54.104
Coming home
from cross country practice.

48:56.669 --> 48:58.306
As soon as I came into
the house, I could hear it.

48:58.341 --> 48:59.703
Right here, in this room.

49:03.478 --> 49:04.609
I looked in,

49:06.745 --> 49:08.217
and he was just...

49:11.453 --> 49:12.650
Just whaling on her.

49:15.259 --> 49:17.160
Really bad,
like a crazy person.

49:20.495 --> 49:22.033
And I just froze.

49:24.664 --> 49:26.697
I didn't know what to do,
I just stood there.

49:29.768 --> 49:32.340
He's screaming,
and she's crying.

49:34.113 --> 49:36.146
And I'm just standing there,
dumb.

49:38.645 --> 49:42.317
And then she looks up at me,
and she's not crying anymore.

49:45.784 --> 49:47.355
And I knew what I should do.

49:49.854 --> 49:51.062
What was right.

49:53.528 --> 49:57.200
That I could stand up to him,
that I could stop him.

50:02.438 --> 50:03.503
But I didn't.

50:06.409 --> 50:08.310
And then,
I ran out of the house,

50:10.611 --> 50:12.413
and I tried
not to think about it.

50:16.353 --> 50:18.188
I thought everything
would be okay.

50:22.557 --> 50:25.492
Next morning,
I found Pepper in the barn,

50:25.527 --> 50:27.362
lying in a pool
of her own blood.

50:30.202 --> 50:31.201
Bullet in her head.

50:36.142 --> 50:37.669
That part had to be
the worst for her,

50:37.704 --> 50:39.242
just knowing what he'd done.

50:43.281 --> 50:46.612
<i>I tried finding her</i>
<i>any way I could,</i>

50:48.154 --> 50:49.681
<i>but, you know,</i>
<i>she didn't wanna be found.</i>

50:49.716 --> 50:52.552
<i>And...</i>

50:52.587 --> 50:55.093
<i>After a while, her phone</i>
<i>stopped working, and I...</i>

50:57.724 --> 50:59.196
I stopped trying.

51:08.735 --> 51:10.834
Your father,

51:10.869 --> 51:13.342
you have spoken with him
about what he did?

51:13.641 --> 51:14.640
No.

51:16.842 --> 51:18.215
No, never.

51:18.250 --> 51:19.348
I mean...

51:21.715 --> 51:25.651
I was 15,
I didn't know how to do that.

51:33.595 --> 51:35.265
I guess I still don't.

52:07.530 --> 52:08.463
Hey, it's Erin.

52:08.498 --> 52:10.564
Um, we're...
We're getting ready to leave,

52:10.599 --> 52:12.434
and I just wanted to call
and check in about, like,

52:12.469 --> 52:14.205
the payment situation.

52:15.604 --> 52:16.603
Yeah.

52:19.245 --> 52:20.706
Well, I was thinking
I could just...

52:20.741 --> 52:21.940
My bank's out of state,
so I can...

52:21.976 --> 52:24.974
It'd probably be easier for me
to wire you the money, or...

52:27.913 --> 52:29.814
Yeah, I'll just get out
however much I can,

52:29.849 --> 52:30.914
and then the rest, I dunno...

52:30.949 --> 52:32.520
Do you have a Venmo,
or something?

52:34.755 --> 52:36.491
Okay.

52:36.526 --> 52:38.559
Okay, cool.
See you then, bye.

52:41.828 --> 52:42.893
You know,
there's a phone inside.

52:42.928 --> 52:44.466
You don't
have to stand out here.

52:44.501 --> 52:45.599
I'm good.

52:49.407 --> 52:50.703
I can't believe you
still drive this thing,

52:50.738 --> 52:52.309
it smells like high school.

52:52.344 --> 52:53.409
- Suits me.

53:12.925 --> 53:13.924
Hello?

53:15.433 --> 53:16.762
Oh, yeah, this is Cal, hi.

53:17.303 --> 53:18.797
Um...

53:18.832 --> 53:22.405
Yeah, well,
it's a 2013 Lexus RX-350.

53:23.705 --> 53:24.771
Well, it's original paint.

53:24.806 --> 53:27.707
Um, it's in great shape,
and the seats are leather.

53:28.314 --> 53:29.313
Tan.

53:30.580 --> 53:32.283
It was my mom's,
she barely drove it.

53:32.318 --> 53:33.746
Um...

53:33.781 --> 53:34.912
Wanna come take a look?

53:36.751 --> 53:38.520
Well, I'm gone today,
but, um...

53:39.457 --> 53:40.852
Okay. Yeah, sure.

53:40.887 --> 53:42.392
All right, thanks, bye.

53:43.758 --> 53:44.757
You good?

54:07.881 --> 54:09.947
The Lexus you're selling,
that was Connie's?

54:11.753 --> 54:12.818
Yeah, why?

54:17.462 --> 54:19.396
She bought it a little
while after you left.

54:22.368 --> 54:23.730
They were in his car
when she died.

54:24.865 --> 54:26.535
It'll be two years in March.

54:27.736 --> 54:28.768
Oh.

54:49.021 --> 54:50.592
I live in Cheyenne, now.

54:58.129 --> 54:59.634
Junior year,
I did an internship

54:59.669 --> 55:00.800
at the city planning department.

55:00.835 --> 55:02.505
I'm a civil engineer.

55:02.540 --> 55:04.738
I will be, eventually. Um...

55:05.807 --> 55:08.775
And after I graduated,
they took me on.

55:08.810 --> 55:12.746
It's mostly ADA compliance
stuff, but I like it.

55:16.521 --> 55:17.685
And we're building some, too.

55:17.720 --> 55:19.489
A big library next year,

55:19.524 --> 55:22.657
and a pedestrian bridge
downtown.

55:23.825 --> 55:25.088
You know how I love bridges.

55:30.898 --> 55:32.436
I live by myself.

55:33.967 --> 55:35.703
Little house
on the south side of town.

55:38.169 --> 55:40.169
Not far from where
we saw Kid Rock that time.

55:40.204 --> 55:43.414
You remember, uh,
Cheyenne Frontier Days?

55:52.821 --> 55:54.018
I have a cat.

55:56.121 --> 55:57.560
Oscar Wilde.

55:59.564 --> 56:01.498
Souvenir from
my last relationship.

56:35.666 --> 56:37.226
- Do you wanna check
my phone for reception?

56:37.261 --> 56:39.701
- You don't have any,
I just checked.

56:39.736 --> 56:43.067
He said to make the second
left after the trailer, so...

56:43.102 --> 56:44.706
Okay. So, this...
Yeah, turn left.

56:45.874 --> 56:47.742
- He's got a red pickup.

56:54.047 --> 56:55.618
Is that it?

56:55.653 --> 56:56.652
Yeah.

56:57.985 --> 56:59.457
Yeah, that must be him.

57:04.662 --> 57:06.695
Mukki?
Sure am.

57:06.730 --> 57:09.258
I'm Erin, this is Cal.
Welcome.

57:09.293 --> 57:10.600
Sorry if you were
waiting long.

57:10.635 --> 57:11.667
Oh, I'm used to it.

57:14.606 --> 57:15.869
We're just gonna head up
this way a bit,

57:15.904 --> 57:16.936
and round the corner.

57:19.974 --> 57:21.545
Well, let's go then.

57:25.309 --> 57:26.583
Take a left here.

57:28.213 --> 57:30.114
Drive must have been
beautiful, innit?

57:30.721 --> 57:32.556
- Yeah.

57:32.591 --> 57:34.789
- Day like this,
you could drive forever.

57:34.824 --> 57:35.690
- Yeah, it was nice.

57:35.725 --> 57:37.825
- You need
to take a right, here.

57:40.863 --> 57:43.226
Must be a little cold up here
for you guys, huh?

57:43.261 --> 57:44.964
- Yeah, a bit.

57:45.736 --> 57:47.098
- Uh, right here.

57:48.233 --> 57:49.903
What's this, a '93?

57:49.938 --> 57:51.201
- Uh, '94.

57:51.236 --> 57:52.675
Nice!
- Yeah.

57:55.075 --> 57:56.745
- And you're gonna
take a left, here.

57:59.948 --> 58:01.783
Pull up right there,
that's it.

58:16.063 --> 58:18.327
Well, there she is!

58:18.362 --> 58:20.131
Give me a sec, and I'm gonna
go fetch the battery.

58:20.166 --> 58:21.770
You wanna pop the hood?
- Sure.

58:23.367 --> 58:25.235
Is that the trailer?
- Yeah, it is.

58:44.861 --> 58:46.564
I like to keep it fresh.

58:46.929 --> 58:47.928
Right.

58:49.360 --> 58:51.063
Um, so, I'm just wondering

58:51.098 --> 58:52.768
when the last time
it got moved was?

58:52.803 --> 58:54.902
Like, since you ran it?

58:54.937 --> 58:57.905
- Hmm...
A month or so ago, maybe.

58:57.940 --> 58:59.104
Maybe less.

59:01.042 --> 59:02.041
Nah, maybe more.

59:03.011 --> 59:04.109
I can't remember.

59:06.751 --> 59:08.916
Funny thing
about not remembering.

59:08.951 --> 59:10.885
Sometimes you're glad for it,

59:10.920 --> 59:12.623
other times
it gets you into trouble.

59:14.220 --> 59:16.055
Well, let's get her
humming for you.

59:17.421 --> 59:18.629
- Sorry.

59:26.837 --> 59:28.331
Like I said,
keeps it fresh.

59:30.940 --> 59:32.808
What's that?
- Shit!

59:34.372 --> 59:36.680
The alternator belt is loose.

59:36.715 --> 59:38.044
Give me a second,
I'll tighten it up.

59:38.079 --> 59:39.375
Okay.

59:43.348 --> 59:45.282
Um...

59:45.317 --> 59:47.218
Erin, have you really
thought this through?

59:49.860 --> 59:51.321
It's just an old truck,
calm down.

59:54.700 --> 59:55.732
What?

59:57.296 --> 59:59.131
Two seconds.
Sorry.

59:59.166 --> 1:00:00.968
You got a phone
to shine a light down here

1:00:01.003 --> 1:00:02.035
for me?
Oh, yeah.

1:00:07.944 --> 1:00:10.747
Are there spare tires
in the truck and trailer?

1:00:10.782 --> 1:00:12.342
- Sure are.

1:00:12.377 --> 1:00:14.377
You might wanna
check the pressure.

1:00:14.412 --> 1:00:17.281
But, yeah,
that ought to do it.

1:00:18.350 --> 1:00:20.119
- Sorry.

1:00:27.931 --> 1:00:29.799
Purr like a kitty cat, right?

1:00:30.868 --> 1:00:33.231
Nice.

1:00:34.135 --> 1:00:35.871
So, you got the cash?

1:00:35.906 --> 1:00:37.367
And then we'll go
take care of the Venmo?

1:00:37.402 --> 1:00:38.841
Yeah.
- Erin. Um...

1:00:38.876 --> 1:00:41.041
Maybe you wanna take it
for a test drive, first?

1:00:42.077 --> 1:00:44.341
Just make sure
you're comfortable, right?

1:00:44.948 --> 1:00:46.178
Okay.

1:00:46.213 --> 1:00:47.817
I mean, you don't mind,
do you?

1:00:47.852 --> 1:00:48.983
No, go ahead.

1:00:49.755 --> 1:00:51.051
Road loops around.

1:01:09.203 --> 1:01:10.840
She your girlfriend?

1:01:11.942 --> 1:01:13.711
Sister.

Where you planning on keeping
an old horse in the Big Apple?

1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:25.211
I'm upstate.

1:02:26.049 --> 1:02:27.246
You got other horses at home?

1:02:28.315 --> 1:02:29.314
- No.

1:02:30.350 --> 1:02:32.350
What, you think
I'm being stupid?

1:02:32.385 --> 1:02:34.022
- Of course not.

1:02:34.057 --> 1:02:36.486
I've done way
stupider things for animals

1:02:36.521 --> 1:02:38.928
than drag a horse from
Montana to the Big Apple.

1:02:40.327 --> 1:02:42.459
Hey, why don't you jump in?
We'll test the lights.

1:02:51.602 --> 1:02:53.140

1:02:54.506 --> 1:02:55.505
Now, right!

1:02:59.445 --> 1:03:00.884
Now, tap the brakes!

1:03:02.514 --> 1:03:04.547

1:03:04.582 --> 1:03:06.252

1:03:07.651 --> 1:03:09.926
The heater should be
working fine.

1:03:09.961 --> 1:03:11.554
I left a blanket in there
for the horse,

1:03:11.589 --> 1:03:13.358
but they're usually good
for some cold.

1:03:13.393 --> 1:03:16.031
Cool, thanks.

1:03:16.066 --> 1:03:19.903

Oh, no.
I'm not doing that.

Nothing.

1:07:51.737 --> 1:07:53.308

But I mean, he seems happy
to help, so...

1:07:57.842 --> 1:07:59.281
Well, I mean, help me.

1:07:59.316 --> 1:08:00.381
You're dead to him.

1:08:01.351 --> 1:08:02.845
See, I told you.

1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:04.517
- It was a joke,
he sounded fine.

1:08:04.552 --> 1:08:07.190
He's just gonna be
a while, so...

1:08:07.225 --> 1:08:09.588
Well, it could be worse.

1:08:13.660 --> 1:08:14.659

1:08:30.710 --> 1:08:32.545

isn't it?

1:08:32.844 --> 1:08:33.843
Yup.

1:08:38.454 --> 1:08:39.552
You mind?

1:08:52.897 --> 1:08:56.239

but cooks all seem to smoke.

1:08:56.274 --> 1:08:57.405

1:08:58.309 --> 1:08:59.770
You're a cook?
Mmm-hmm.

1:09:03.941 --> 1:09:06.579
This little
farm-to-table place,

1:09:06.614 --> 1:09:08.779
near Red Hook,
called Sinew.

1:09:09.815 --> 1:09:11.584
In the Hudson Valley,
in New York.

1:09:12.356 --> 1:09:13.355
Right.

1:09:14.017 --> 1:09:15.225
Upstate.

1:09:16.294 --> 1:09:17.293
Right.

1:09:19.363 --> 1:09:20.560
Supposed to be ironic.

1:09:21.464 --> 1:09:22.793
"Sinew."

1:09:22.828 --> 1:09:23.761
Tough and strong,

1:09:23.796 --> 1:09:26.566
not something anyone
would actually wanna eat.

1:09:26.601 --> 1:09:28.436
Get it?

1:09:32.970 --> 1:09:35.806
Our thing is that we use
the whole animal,

1:09:36.776 --> 1:09:37.841
snout to tail.

1:09:39.009 --> 1:09:40.250
You heard of that?

1:09:40.285 --> 1:09:41.581
Mmm.

1:09:41.616 --> 1:09:43.682
So, we kill it.

1:09:43.717 --> 1:09:44.716
Cook it.

1:09:45.785 --> 1:09:47.818
Serve it. All of it.

1:10:03.572 --> 1:10:05.572
When I first left here,

1:10:05.607 --> 1:10:09.477
I went out and stayed with
my mother's sister in Albany.

1:10:09.512 --> 1:10:10.511
You know, Deena?

1:10:11.448 --> 1:10:12.777
She got me a job at this...

1:10:14.484 --> 1:10:15.549
...diner near her.

1:10:15.584 --> 1:10:17.485
It was a shit-hole,
but I liked it.

1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:18.519
Loved cooking.

1:10:19.588 --> 1:10:20.587
So...

1:10:21.557 --> 1:10:22.655
Saved my money...

1:10:24.428 --> 1:10:26.560
...and got into
the Culinary Academy,

1:10:28.861 --> 1:10:30.630
and that was that,
now I'm a cook.

1:10:41.874 --> 1:10:42.972
You know where we are?

1:10:43.612 --> 1:10:44.743
Um...

1:10:46.351 --> 1:10:47.977
MT-69, the middle of nowhere.

1:10:48.012 --> 1:10:49.913
Yeah, that.

1:10:53.787 --> 1:10:57.052
But, no, we're 15 minutes
from Copperhead.

1:11:00.090 --> 1:11:01.529
Yeah, I guess we are.

1:11:04.501 --> 1:11:05.566
Let's go.

1:11:08.131 --> 1:11:09.405
Really?

1:11:10.606 --> 1:11:11.737
In for a penny...

1:11:17.580 --> 1:11:18.678
Come on!

1:11:42.132 --> 1:11:44.341
- What's with this state,
and phone service?

1:11:45.608 --> 1:11:48.873
- Oh, yeah,
I remember where we are now.

1:11:48.908 --> 1:11:51.073
- That's it, just pull up
right over there.

1:11:57.785 --> 1:11:59.653
- I didn't think
I'd ever be back here.

1:12:01.085 --> 1:12:02.920
- Somehow,
I always thought I would.

1:12:33.117 --> 1:12:36.459
- Wow,
you sort of forget...

1:12:36.494 --> 1:12:37.922
- And then, there it is.

1:12:56.712 --> 1:12:58.745
This place always seemed
like a miracle to me.

1:13:00.617 --> 1:13:02.947
Like they were building
something into the ground.

1:13:04.522 --> 1:13:08.183
Not just digging a hole,
but actually making something.

1:13:08.218 --> 1:13:10.658
Carving one shape
out of another.

1:13:13.960 --> 1:13:17.192
I see now where
the engineer in you was born.

1:13:17.227 --> 1:13:20.569
Yeah, from the belly
of the beast

1:13:22.507 --> 1:13:25.442
that our dad helped shield
from government oversight.

1:14:09.653 --> 1:14:13.556
Reminds me more
of Dante's Circles of Hell.

1:14:14.823 --> 1:14:16.526

The unbaptized
are in the first circle.

1:14:27.605 --> 1:14:29.638
Then there's the gluttons.

1:14:30.608 --> 1:14:32.872
The avaricious,
the wrathful.

1:14:34.942 --> 1:14:36.073
The heretics.

1:14:37.274 --> 1:14:38.548
And our people,

1:14:38.583 --> 1:14:41.012
the plunderers,
the hypocrites.

1:14:41.047 --> 1:14:42.783
You have this memorized?
Yeah.

1:14:43.621 --> 1:14:45.786
Then the barrators...

1:14:45.821 --> 1:14:49.152
The counselors of fraud,
my fave.

1:14:49.187 --> 1:14:51.924
Wait, counselors of fraud,
really?

1:14:52.597 --> 1:14:54.025
Yeah.

1:14:54.060 --> 1:14:56.126
I mean, in translation, yeah.

1:14:56.161 --> 1:14:57.930
- That could have
been his business card.

1:14:57.965 --> 1:15:00.328
Hmm.

1:15:00.363 --> 1:15:03.100
You'd think they'd have filled
it in or something, by now.

1:15:03.135 --> 1:15:05.201
Nah.

1:15:05.236 --> 1:15:07.742
Cheaper and easier
to leave it alone

1:15:07.777 --> 1:15:08.974
and keep everyone away.

1:15:10.813 --> 1:15:13.682
Just another crime scene
out in the Old West.

1:15:13.717 --> 1:15:16.047
Yeah, there should be
caution tape.

1:15:23.023 --> 1:15:24.957
- Growing up,
we were so indoctrinated

1:15:24.992 --> 1:15:26.321
with the whole
Big Sky thing.

1:15:28.897 --> 1:15:32.228
The field trips to
Yellowstone, endless horizons.

1:15:34.705 --> 1:15:35.571
I really bought it.

1:15:38.643 --> 1:15:41.677
Then after I left,
and being in New York,

1:15:44.715 --> 1:15:48.310
I started wondering
if it's just so big that...

1:15:50.182 --> 1:15:52.754
you lose any sense
of perspective at all.

1:15:54.186 --> 1:15:55.724
If it's so big that you...

1:15:57.156 --> 1:16:00.355
step outside and feel like
you're inside of something.

1:16:03.393 --> 1:16:04.733
And now?

1:16:06.671 --> 1:16:08.132
Have you found
your way out of it?

1:16:11.808 --> 1:16:13.841
You know what
the final circle of hell is?

1:16:16.175 --> 1:16:17.713
The very bottom of the pit?

1:16:23.149 --> 1:16:24.379
It's reserved for the...

1:16:25.954 --> 1:16:28.152
betrayers of
special relationships.

1:16:31.729 --> 1:16:32.794
Like, community...

1:16:35.832 --> 1:16:36.831
Kin.

1:16:47.778 --> 1:16:49.844
We should go.
Okay.

1:16:49.879 --> 1:16:50.878
Yeah.

1:16:58.316 --> 1:16:59.887
- When did you read
the<i> Inferno?</i>

1:17:00.791 --> 1:17:01.790
Cooking school.

1:17:09.833 --> 1:17:11.800
What where you
doing with him yesterday?

1:17:13.804 --> 1:17:14.935
With who?

1:17:14.970 --> 1:17:17.168
Dad, when I saw you.
You and Ace.

1:17:19.843 --> 1:17:21.469
Um...

1:17:21.504 --> 1:17:25.176
Ace was explaining to me
how a body can still react,

1:17:25.211 --> 1:17:26.441
even after the brain

1:17:26.476 --> 1:17:28.047
stops functioning.
Did you talk with Ace,

1:17:28.082 --> 1:17:29.081
about us?

1:17:30.821 --> 1:17:32.282
About me, what happened?

1:17:33.483 --> 1:17:35.087
Why does it matter?

1:17:37.190 --> 1:17:39.025
Just curious.

1:17:39.060 --> 1:17:41.995
I was just explaining to him
what was going on--

1:17:42.030 --> 1:17:43.128
Never mind, there's Joey.

1:18:00.917 --> 1:18:02.147
Erin, jeez!

1:18:03.051 --> 1:18:04.985
Hey.
It's so good to see you!

1:18:05.020 --> 1:18:06.481
- Yeah, good to see you.

1:18:08.353 --> 1:18:10.518
Thanks for coming, Joe.
Yeah, sure.

1:18:10.553 --> 1:18:12.421
Is this Mukki's old-ass truck?

1:18:13.061 --> 1:18:14.093
You know Mukki?

1:18:14.865 --> 1:18:15.996
Yeah, I know Mukki.

1:18:18.396 --> 1:18:21.232
Okay, well, um,
I'll ride with you, yeah?

1:18:22.334 --> 1:18:24.103
Okay. All right.

1:18:24.138 --> 1:18:25.907
Uh, Cal,
do you wanna follow us?

1:18:25.942 --> 1:18:26.974
Yep.

1:18:27.009 --> 1:18:28.074
- Cool.

1:18:55.268 --> 1:18:56.432
- My mom said she's known

1:18:56.467 --> 1:18:58.236
where you've been
this whole time.

1:18:59.140 --> 1:19:00.139
Yeah.

1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:04.242
You always had a way with her.

1:19:06.510 --> 1:19:08.378
I think she just understood,
that's all.

1:19:08.413 --> 1:19:09.445
- Uh-huh.

1:19:11.020 --> 1:19:14.318
Man, you've been
missed around here.

1:19:14.353 --> 1:19:17.387
I mean, Cal, you know,
but me, too.

1:19:17.422 --> 1:19:18.927
The three of us
being together.

1:19:20.194 --> 1:19:21.424
I had to go.

1:19:21.459 --> 1:19:22.832
Yeah, I get it.

1:19:23.901 --> 1:19:25.263
You know, it's just...

1:19:25.298 --> 1:19:27.034
It's just not the same place.

1:19:28.598 --> 1:19:31.170
It's not the same place
without you home.

1:19:41.314 --> 1:19:42.577
You know,
I can fix this, uh,

1:19:42.612 --> 1:19:44.249
old-ass truck for you
if you want?

1:19:44.955 --> 1:19:46.020
Oh, yeah?

1:19:48.057 --> 1:19:49.155
I think so.

1:19:50.356 --> 1:19:51.828
Yeah, that would be great.

1:19:52.589 --> 1:19:53.622
And if I can't, you know,

1:19:53.657 --> 1:19:56.063
maybe you outta let me drive
you and Mr. T out east.

1:19:59.464 --> 1:20:01.266
Why would you?

1:20:01.301 --> 1:20:03.268
Why not?
Why wouldn't I help you?

1:20:04.568 --> 1:20:05.842
It'd be fun.

1:20:06.669 --> 1:20:08.174
And it's what's right.

1:20:11.476 --> 1:20:12.541
Thank you, Joey.

1:20:15.084 --> 1:20:16.611
I'll think about it, okay?

1:20:19.022 --> 1:20:20.087
Okay.

1:20:21.222 --> 1:20:23.156
You think about it.

1:24:42.186 --> 1:24:43.845
This is very beautiful, Erin.

1:24:45.717 --> 1:24:47.486
- Well, there wasn't
much other than the bird,

1:24:47.521 --> 1:24:50.720
but, the orchard still
has apples and honey, so...

1:24:51.624 --> 1:24:52.920
Erin's a cook, Ace.

1:24:52.955 --> 1:24:54.790
Ah, yes, I can see!

1:24:54.825 --> 1:24:57.529
Some things are clear
without explanation, Cal.

1:25:01.865 --> 1:25:03.205
Bon appetit.

1:25:09.312 --> 1:25:12.247
- Mmm, that's good.
- Mmm-hmm.

1:25:12.282 --> 1:25:13.941
- I remember
noticing the orchard

1:25:13.976 --> 1:25:15.415
when I first arrived.

1:25:15.450 --> 1:25:16.911
Makes the house so beautiful.

1:25:16.946 --> 1:25:19.452
Yeah, and I'm okay with that.

1:25:19.487 --> 1:25:20.882
- Takes forever
getting anywhere.

1:25:20.917 --> 1:25:22.389
Which is fine.

1:25:22.424 --> 1:25:25.458
What I will never
get used to is the cold.

1:25:25.493 --> 1:25:28.197
No one does.

1:25:28.232 --> 1:25:30.265
- You know what they say
about Montana.

1:25:30.300 --> 1:25:31.926
You don't like the weather,
just wait five minutes.

1:25:35.965 --> 1:25:37.173
- So, um...

1:25:38.308 --> 1:25:39.835
Ace.

1:25:39.870 --> 1:25:42.277
I hear you've gotten
a little taste

1:25:42.312 --> 1:25:44.279
of our family history
from my brother.

1:25:45.975 --> 1:25:47.579
- Ah, yes.

1:25:47.614 --> 1:25:48.613
This is true.

1:25:50.353 --> 1:25:52.584
Pretty rough, huh?

1:25:56.326 --> 1:25:58.491
Well, I mean,
I'm glad you know.

1:25:58.526 --> 1:26:00.592
Right? You should know, you
spend a lot of time with him.

1:26:00.627 --> 1:26:02.759
You should know whose
asshole it is you're wiping.

1:26:03.927 --> 1:26:05.300
Our asshole.

1:26:05.335 --> 1:26:07.599
I can tell you,

1:26:07.634 --> 1:26:09.238
to a nurse,

1:26:09.273 --> 1:26:10.965
one asshole
is very much like another.

1:26:18.282 --> 1:26:21.778
Your father is a man
whose past is complete now.

1:26:25.982 --> 1:26:27.982
Nothing more
will be added to his story.

1:26:29.326 --> 1:26:30.952
He is the sum of his days.

1:26:44.869 --> 1:26:46.341
Excuse me.

1:26:49.412 --> 1:26:50.510
This still happens?

1:26:50.545 --> 1:26:52.281
I guess, I don't know.

1:26:55.484 --> 1:26:56.615
Okay.

1:26:59.521 --> 1:27:02.049
- Ace,
is everything all right?

1:27:02.084 --> 1:27:04.326
- The ventilator
backup power isn't working.

1:27:04.955 --> 1:27:06.460
I have to bag him.

1:27:06.495 --> 1:27:08.792
- Uh, there used to be
a generator in the garage

1:27:08.827 --> 1:27:10.860
for when this would happen.
Go, quickly!

1:27:23.578 --> 1:27:24.775
How long can you do that?

1:27:26.383 --> 1:27:29.813
Uh, if the electricity
doesn't return,

1:27:29.848 --> 1:27:31.518
we'll have to get him
to the hospital.

1:28:11.989 --> 1:28:13.087
- Over there.

1:28:38.554 --> 1:28:39.619
Fuck!

1:28:50.731 --> 1:28:51.829
What's going on?

1:28:53.998 --> 1:28:56.867
Erin, I need you
to come over here.

1:28:56.902 --> 1:28:59.067
Put both your hands on this,
do what you see me doing.

1:29:00.906 --> 1:29:01.938
I can't.

1:29:01.973 --> 1:29:03.940
Erin, now.

1:29:03.975 --> 1:29:05.612
Erin, please,
we don't have time!

1:29:08.914 --> 1:29:10.914
Watch your step,
watch your step.

1:29:12.214 --> 1:29:13.884
This one down here.

1:29:13.919 --> 1:29:15.919
Okay, and then
your left hand. Okay.

1:29:21.663 --> 1:29:22.761
Okay.

1:29:25.865 --> 1:29:27.700
I think he may be
having a heart attack.

1:29:30.507 --> 1:29:33.409
Please, just be steady and
consistent, as you squeeze.

1:30:14.177 --> 1:30:17.079
Please try and squeeze
more firmly, just a little.

1:31:15.106 --> 1:31:17.205
Well, I guess we don't
need the generator anymore.

1:31:21.684 --> 1:31:22.683
What happened?

1:31:23.785 --> 1:31:24.784
Erin?

1:31:30.660 --> 1:31:32.319
Erin, what happened?

1:31:32.354 --> 1:31:33.859
I should never
have come back here.

1:31:33.894 --> 1:31:35.256
What happened?

1:31:35.291 --> 1:31:36.895
I should never have
fucking come back here.

1:31:36.930 --> 1:31:37.896
- Erin?

1:31:37.931 --> 1:31:39.667
I should never have come.
I mean, what the fuck?

1:31:39.702 --> 1:31:40.998
Why did you just leave me
alone with him?

1:31:41.033 --> 1:31:42.164
Erin, I'm sorry.

1:31:42.199 --> 1:31:43.836
He had a heart attack!
What?

1:31:43.871 --> 1:31:46.674
He had a fucking
heart attack! Are you deaf?

1:31:46.709 --> 1:31:48.643
Why did you just
leave me alone with him?

1:31:51.978 --> 1:31:54.616
Ace needed to do the chest
things, the compressions,

1:31:54.651 --> 1:31:56.684
so I had to keep that bag
going with my hands.

1:31:56.719 --> 1:31:58.114
I'm, like, breathing for him,

1:31:58.149 --> 1:31:59.819
keeping him alive
with my fucking hands!

1:31:59.854 --> 1:32:00.952
I just saved his life!

1:32:03.220 --> 1:32:04.351
I feel sick.

1:32:04.386 --> 1:32:05.627
I feel sick.

1:32:10.260 --> 1:32:12.733
Why did you leave me
alone with him?

1:32:12.768 --> 1:32:14.702
- Erin, I thought
I could get the generator.

1:32:14.737 --> 1:32:16.099
Not tonight, seven years ago.

1:32:18.367 --> 1:32:20.576
You saw what he was doing
to me, but you left.

1:32:21.645 --> 1:32:23.271
You left me alone
with him. Why?

1:32:26.111 --> 1:32:27.242
How?

1:32:30.181 --> 1:32:31.785
I saw you there,
and I thought,

1:32:32.920 --> 1:32:33.952
he'll stop this.

1:32:33.987 --> 1:32:35.316
He's gonna do something,
he'll save me.

1:32:35.351 --> 1:32:36.383
I'm so sorry.

1:32:36.418 --> 1:32:37.956
But you didn't!

1:32:41.731 --> 1:32:43.126
What more did you need to see?

1:32:43.161 --> 1:32:45.260
What did he have to do to me
to push you into that room?

1:32:45.295 --> 1:32:46.360
That fucking room,
right there?

1:32:46.395 --> 1:32:47.603
I don't know.

1:32:49.365 --> 1:32:51.640
I... I couldn't.

1:32:51.675 --> 1:32:52.806
I was afraid.

1:32:54.876 --> 1:32:56.271
And I didn't think
that he...

1:32:56.306 --> 1:32:57.646
That he'd kill me?

1:32:59.210 --> 1:33:00.616
He almost killed me.

1:33:02.917 --> 1:33:04.653
He broke my nose.

1:33:04.688 --> 1:33:06.754
Separated my shoulder.
Cracked my ribs.

1:33:07.790 --> 1:33:10.021
And it went on.

1:33:10.056 --> 1:33:12.386
And it went on,
and I couldn't
get him to stop!

1:33:12.421 --> 1:33:13.761
And at the hospital,

1:33:13.796 --> 1:33:14.828
they wanted
to call the police,

1:33:14.863 --> 1:33:16.291
but I wouldn't tell them
what happened.

1:33:22.805 --> 1:33:24.871
I loved you, so much!

1:33:27.040 --> 1:33:28.303
So much!

1:33:38.722 --> 1:33:40.887
How could you just walk away?
I don't know.

1:33:41.758 --> 1:33:42.790
How could you abandon...

1:33:42.825 --> 1:33:43.857
I don't know!

1:33:45.960 --> 1:33:48.224
I've been asking myself
that for seven years,

1:33:48.259 --> 1:33:50.325
and I don't fucking know!

1:33:52.769 --> 1:33:54.296
Am I a coward?

1:33:54.331 --> 1:33:56.166
Is there something wrong
with me?

1:33:59.105 --> 1:34:02.337
Every night I close my eyes,
and all I see is your face.

1:34:04.044 --> 1:34:07.408
That look on your face,

1:34:07.443 --> 1:34:09.784
pleading with me
to make him stop.

1:34:11.480 --> 1:34:13.018
And every night I wake up,

1:34:13.053 --> 1:34:14.855
and I think that
something must be wrong.

1:34:14.890 --> 1:34:16.219
That can't be what happened.

1:34:17.827 --> 1:34:19.321
I couldn't have walked away.

1:34:31.269 --> 1:34:32.537
But I did.

1:34:36.406 --> 1:34:37.812
That is what happened.

1:34:38.848 --> 1:34:40.749
And that's how
it's always gonna be.

1:34:42.148 --> 1:34:43.851
I didn't stop him.

1:34:45.349 --> 1:34:46.821
I didn't even try.

1:34:50.189 --> 1:34:52.761
And I am sorry, I really am.

1:34:59.099 --> 1:35:00.329
I missed you.

1:35:02.498 --> 1:35:03.838
So much.

1:35:13.311 --> 1:35:14.376
Yeah.

1:35:16.853 --> 1:35:18.215
Yeah, me, too.

1:35:24.355 --> 1:35:25.486
Okay.

1:37:40.194 --> 1:37:41.523
Why don't you
go get some rest?

1:37:43.329 --> 1:37:44.900
You can use my room,
I'll sit with him.

1:37:46.002 --> 1:37:47.199
That is okay.

1:37:47.234 --> 1:37:48.233
I'm good, Cal.

1:37:49.269 --> 1:37:50.367
Really, I'd like to.

1:37:51.337 --> 1:37:52.633
- It has been
a trying night...

1:37:52.668 --> 1:37:54.503
I need to be
alone with him, now.

1:37:59.642 --> 1:38:00.641
Okay.

1:38:09.993 --> 1:38:11.586
I'm going to go for a walk.

1:38:13.293 --> 1:38:14.556
I see the rain has stopped.

1:38:18.331 --> 1:38:19.330
Good night, Cal.

1:38:57.601 --> 1:39:00.041
I would have liked to
have known Erin's mom.

1:39:02.243 --> 1:39:03.638
To see how happy she made you.

1:39:12.550 --> 1:39:15.617
But maybe
that's just a story, right?

1:39:18.193 --> 1:39:19.390
That you told yourself.

1:39:21.493 --> 1:39:22.492
And us.

1:39:25.068 --> 1:39:26.562
Your great love for Libby.

1:39:30.139 --> 1:39:32.040
Your great sadness
when she died.

1:39:36.475 --> 1:39:38.706
It was something my mother
always took in stride.

1:39:40.281 --> 1:39:41.478
Being less for you.

1:39:43.581 --> 1:39:45.020
An afterthought.

1:39:48.388 --> 1:39:50.388
Much like she accepted
your anger,

1:39:52.392 --> 1:39:53.721
and your distraction.

1:39:56.462 --> 1:39:57.461
All just...

1:39:59.168 --> 1:40:00.431
part of the package.

1:40:02.435 --> 1:40:03.566
But Erin was different.

1:40:05.669 --> 1:40:06.734
It hurt her,

1:40:08.243 --> 1:40:09.539
and you couldn't see that.

1:40:11.741 --> 1:40:13.741
You couldn't see
why she did what she did,

1:40:14.777 --> 1:40:16.546
how much she needed you.

1:40:18.748 --> 1:40:20.319
I used to think to myself,

1:40:22.587 --> 1:40:24.686
how can someone so smart

1:40:25.623 --> 1:40:27.095
be so dumb?

1:40:31.860 --> 1:40:33.233
Now I wonder...

1:40:36.601 --> 1:40:39.602
how could someone so loved
have been so cruel?

1:40:54.718 --> 1:40:57.125
You lived as if life
were a sad burden.

1:40:59.591 --> 1:41:01.558
Maybe being dead
will be better.

1:41:53.612 --> 1:41:55.249
- During the power failure,

1:41:55.284 --> 1:41:58.153
he may have experienced
a cardiac event.

1:41:58.980 --> 1:42:02.223
But after, yes, he was stable.

1:42:02.984 --> 1:42:04.192
For a time.

1:42:05.624 --> 1:42:07.690
Did you call the hospital?

1:42:07.725 --> 1:42:10.363
No, the storm had not stopped,

1:42:10.398 --> 1:42:13.498
and, his vital signs
were strong.

1:42:14.402 --> 1:42:15.500
Our decision,

1:42:17.372 --> 1:42:19.273
my decision,
was to wait until morning.

1:42:20.408 --> 1:42:23.640
But most sadly,
then, he passed.

1:42:48.271 --> 1:42:49.567
They're taking the body away.

1:43:00.349 --> 1:43:01.546
Hey, Mr. T.

1:43:03.649 --> 1:43:04.648
Hey.

1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:07.717
Hey, beauty.

1:43:16.024 --> 1:43:17.232
Hey.

1:43:17.663 --> 1:43:18.662
Hey.

1:43:21.799 --> 1:43:23.370
Did you get ahold of Joey?

1:43:24.934 --> 1:43:25.933
Yeah.

1:43:27.002 --> 1:43:28.001
And?

1:43:30.676 --> 1:43:31.873
He likes the idea.

1:43:56.097 --> 1:43:57.668
Are you going to be okay?

1:43:59.969 --> 1:44:01.001
Yeah.

1:44:03.907 --> 1:44:04.972
Thank you.

1:44:08.582 --> 1:44:10.483
Ace, how many of these
have you had,

1:44:10.980 --> 1:44:12.045
your patients?

1:44:13.048 --> 1:44:14.047
Um...

1:44:15.391 --> 1:44:16.555
I don't know.

1:44:18.119 --> 1:44:20.724
I guess it's not something
that I like to count.

1:44:23.729 --> 1:44:24.794
No.
