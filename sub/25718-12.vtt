00:47.380 --> 00:48.548
Kang Mi-rae.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.478
If...

01:04.188 --> 01:06.483
something like that
happens to you again,

01:10.361 --> 01:12.113
I'll get involved without
punching someone.

01:15.700 --> 01:16.993
That will be okay, right?

01:22.624 --> 01:24.626
If you keep saying things like that,

01:27.003 --> 01:28.630
I'll get the wrong idea.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.008
About what?

01:33.843 --> 01:35.678
Just like how I'm feeling, you might...

01:42.894 --> 01:43.770
Never mind.

01:44.896 --> 01:45.980
You should get going.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.357
I'm going to go.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.578
Do you by any chance...

02:05.375 --> 02:06.626
have any feelings for me?

02:08.002 --> 02:08.836
What?

02:22.642 --> 02:24.644
No, it's not like that.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.398
If...

02:29.899 --> 02:32.735
I'm sorry If you got offended by
how I jumped to conclusions like that.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.614
But I've never thought of you
more than a friend, so don't worry.

02:36.698 --> 02:37.907
What, worry?

02:38.867 --> 02:40.160
That's not what I meant.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.870
We're friends, right?

02:42.453 --> 02:45.290
I really think of you just as a friend.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.293
100 percent.

02:52.088 --> 02:52.922
Hey.

02:54.757 --> 02:55.967
By any chance, do you...

02:57.677 --> 02:59.679
Do you have a crush on someone else?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.602
No, I don't have a crush on anyone.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.984
See you tomorrow.
I'm going to go.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.625
<i>Do you by any chance...</i>

04:12.085 --> 04:13.753
have any feelings for me?

04:17.173 --> 04:18.382
<i>No.</i>

04:19.841 --> 04:21.386
<i>No, don't think about it.</i>

04:22.720 --> 04:24.472
<i>I've already given up.</i>

04:25.265 --> 04:27.058
<i>I can never date Kyung-seok.</i>

04:31.771 --> 04:34.232
<i>I don't want my life to get ruined again.</i>

05:00.008 --> 05:01.009
Did something happen?

05:01.634 --> 05:02.927
You seem upset.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.180
There's no alcohol.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.436
Oh, I noticed you didn't clean today.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.688
I did it for you, so you better
clean well from tomorrow.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.899
I'll just pay the full rent
going forward,

05:17.984 --> 05:19.402
so let's divide the housework.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.992
I guess your part-time job
pays you well.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.291
What's with him?

05:46.679 --> 05:47.930
<i>We're friends, right?</i>

05:48.681 --> 05:51.768
I really think of you just as a friend.

05:53.561 --> 05:54.395
100 percent.

06:16.918 --> 06:17.960
What's wrong?

06:18.503 --> 06:20.380
What? Oh no, it's nothing.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.093
<i>What am I going to do</i>
<i>if I run into him?</i>

06:26.386 --> 06:27.637
<i>What am I supposed to say?</i>

06:28.846 --> 06:31.432
-Hey, it's a special lecture.
-It must be held by Kelun.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.976
-Where's the lecture held at?
-It doesn't say it there.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.063
Does that mean we can meet
Ms. Na Hye-sung in person?

06:37.397 --> 06:38.398
I'm so excited.

06:38.564 --> 06:39.649
It sounds fun.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.776
I'm glad I didn't enroll
in summer classes.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.028
Do you think Woo-young
will be attending as well?

06:44.320 --> 06:47.657
If you like him so much,
you should dress up like me.

06:48.324 --> 06:49.867
That's not my true self.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.787
I don't want to seduce him
by faking myself.

06:52.870 --> 06:53.704
Seduce?

06:53.830 --> 06:55.164
Did you just say seduce?

06:55.915 --> 06:58.126
That word doesn't suit you at all.

06:58.876 --> 06:59.710
Hey!

07:01.629 --> 07:03.756
-Did you put up a banner for me?
-Of course.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.341
It's a special lecture by you.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.010
I didn't think I'd be nervous.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.054
But I am now that I'm here.

07:14.642 --> 07:15.643
Are you going to sing?

07:16.727 --> 07:17.687
Will they make me sing?

07:17.770 --> 07:20.189
Sure, kids these days are difficult
to deal with.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.152
That actually made me
pull myself together.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.195
I wish you good luck.

07:29.866 --> 07:30.741
What should I do?

07:34.412 --> 07:36.414
Are you sure Woo-young is coming?

07:36.664 --> 07:39.667
Gosh, stop talking about him.
I'm sure he'll be here.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.433
A SCENT THAT WILL MAKE
PEOPLE REMEMBER YOU.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.271
I guess the power of genetics is
really incredible.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.649
My mother-in-law's so pretty.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.569
Since when did she become
your mother-in-law?

08:09.280 --> 08:10.907
Since today?

08:10.990 --> 08:15.369
I can see where Kyung-seok got
his looks from.

08:15.912 --> 08:20.041
His mom's beautiful but Kyung-seok isn't
that good looking.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.461
Frankly, he and I are pretty much
on the same level. We're both tall.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.380
Do you have any conscience at all?

08:31.552 --> 08:34.304
I'm sure you all know who she is
but I'll still introduce her to you.

08:34.388 --> 08:37.225
She's a proud graduate of Hankook
University's chemistry department

08:37.350 --> 08:39.184
and CEO of Kelun Korea.
She's Ms. Na Hye-sung.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.691
I'm glad to meet you all.
My name is Na Hye-sung.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.450
Where's Kyung-seok?

08:55.284 --> 08:58.663
He's mom came to school to give a lecture
but he's not even here.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.588
Our manager desperately waited
for you to come

09:07.672 --> 09:10.383
but he went to a seminar abroad.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.011
I might not be as good as him,
but can I still give it a try?

09:14.095 --> 09:16.556
I don't care as long as you pay me.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.975
Thank you for trusting me.

09:19.475 --> 09:20.685
Do I get paid right away?

09:20.768 --> 09:24.605
Of course, you'll get paid
as soon as you're done. Let's begin.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.528
You have a girlfriend, right?

09:30.611 --> 09:32.905
I hope she'll like it.

09:32.989 --> 09:36.367
But then, I don't think it matters
since you're so handsome.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.704
Even an afro would look like
a fashion trend if you do it.

09:42.873 --> 09:48.838
What I meant was a person's look
is what completes the hairstyle.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.383
I won't do an afro on you.
I'm not out of my mind.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.885
Perfume always comes last.

09:55.636 --> 09:56.804
Let me explain.

09:56.887 --> 09:59.515
When you get ready to go out,
you put on your clothes, do your hair,

09:59.599 --> 10:00.725
and put makeup on.

10:01.017 --> 10:04.020
And no one puts on perfume
before doing any of those things.

10:04.103 --> 10:07.023
However, there are times when this
invisible last step

10:07.106 --> 10:09.859
ends up lingering in people's memories
for a long time.

10:09.942 --> 10:14.405
It's hard to remember a certain person's
hairstyle or outfit from long time ago.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.991
But you remember their smell.

10:17.074 --> 10:19.827
That smell stays in your head
along with that person's image.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.375
This is yours, right?

10:28.294 --> 10:29.629
You can wear that perfume.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.842
When you smell the steam
from a rice cooker,

10:35.092 --> 10:37.303
you're reminded of your mother.

10:37.386 --> 10:40.389
And when you smell the perfume
you used to wear a long time ago,

10:40.681 --> 10:43.225
you're reminded
of how you used to feel back then.

10:44.060 --> 10:48.397
I'm not sure how you'll remember me...

10:59.533 --> 11:01.285
Isn't that Kyung-seok?

11:01.911 --> 11:04.664
I have to say, he likes to put himself
in the spotlight.

11:22.556 --> 11:26.227
I don't know how you'll remember me
after this lecture.

11:26.310 --> 11:29.021
-Don't ever dye your hair like him.
-But I hope...

11:29.105 --> 11:31.315
-It doesn't look good on him.
-...you'll at least remember

11:31.399 --> 11:33.734
what I told you all about scent today.

11:33.818 --> 11:38.364
If you wish to take part in our company
program, please submit applications.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.700
I'll end my lecture here.

11:50.501 --> 11:53.254
-Thank you for the lecture.
-Thank you.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.720
-Your finals are coming up, right?
-Yes.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.139
Is everything okay?

12:03.764 --> 12:04.807
What do you mean?

12:06.100 --> 12:06.934
Well...

12:07.727 --> 12:11.105
What's your plan for the summer?
Are you going to apply for the program?

12:12.898 --> 12:13.899
I'll think about it.

12:14.608 --> 12:17.027
Okay, but I hope you do apply.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.490
See you.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.248
Is he going through late adolescence?

12:30.249 --> 12:31.459
What's up with him?

12:33.169 --> 12:35.713
Girls get their hair done after
they go through a break up.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.715
I wonder if it's something similar.

12:44.764 --> 12:45.723
I'm sorry.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.191
You dyed your hair.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.611
Yes.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.740
-It looks pretty.
-I didn't do it to look pretty.

13:03.073 --> 13:05.701
Oh, sorry. It looks good.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.161
I didn't do it to look good.

13:07.828 --> 13:08.662
Oh really?

13:09.288 --> 13:11.957
-I guess you just did it for no reason.
-Not exactly.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.753
Well, okay.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.964
I'll go now. Good luck on your finals.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.220
Why did I say good luck?
The exams haven't even started yet.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.263
This is driving me crazy.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.561
Is  he getting ready to become
a celebrity?

13:32.937 --> 13:34.313
With his personality?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.941
What's wrong with Kyung-seok's
personality?

13:38.067 --> 13:39.485
It's not normal.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.111
He'll never do as he's told.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.823
With Kyung-seok's good looks

13:44.114 --> 13:46.283
his manager will listen
to Kyung-seok's orders.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.538
Do you still like Kyung-seok?

13:53.707 --> 13:54.917
To be honest,

13:55.459 --> 13:57.419
I gave up on him.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.213
I gave up.

14:01.924 --> 14:05.094
But he's too good-looking
to erase from my heart.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.765
I know you guys all have a small crush
on him as well.

14:10.599 --> 14:11.475
Am I wrong?

14:26.699 --> 14:29.910
Be honest with me.
My cooking was terrible, right?

14:33.789 --> 14:35.499
You can be honest with me.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.711
No, it wasn't that bad.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.799
By the way, Kyung-hee.
Will you take a look at this?

14:49.471 --> 14:50.931
-Is that Kyung-seok?
-Yes.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.642
I didn't want to sound too nagging

14:53.809 --> 14:55.811
so I couldn't ask why he dyed his hair.

14:56.645 --> 14:58.939
He's not the type who cares about
his looks.

14:59.523 --> 15:00.941
What's wrong with him?

15:01.775 --> 15:04.069
-Maybe he's dating someone.
-Do you think so?

15:04.695 --> 15:07.865
Or maybe, he got his heart broken
by someone.

15:10.910 --> 15:11.994
By whom?

15:19.501 --> 15:20.336
Thanks.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.130
Write me a receipt.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.384
You said a verbal agreement
wouldn't be effective.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.304
I see that you've got used to
life in society now.

15:30.387 --> 15:33.766
-Didn't I say I learn things quickly?
-It's partly thanks to my useful tips.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.851
It's not cool to take credit like that.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.814
-How cool of you.
-Aren't you writing me a receipt?

15:48.238 --> 15:50.324
Did you do modeling for a hair salon?

15:51.617 --> 15:52.618
How did you know?

15:53.202 --> 15:55.162
I told you. I've done
almost every part-time job.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.330
DO KYUNG-SEOK HAS PAID

15:56.413 --> 15:58.791
I thought you wouldn't do such a thing
with your personality.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.751
Did you not like doing chores?

16:01.293 --> 16:04.046
Or is there a change in your mind?

16:08.676 --> 16:10.511
Don't act like you know about me.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.912
He changed his hair color again.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.856
I got this question wrong.

18:28.065 --> 18:31.110
Finals are finally over!

18:33.904 --> 18:37.491
Hey, finals are over.
How about we go play games?

18:37.616 --> 18:39.409
Sure, let's get it.

18:39.868 --> 18:40.828
Let's go.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.163
It's over.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.125
Why don't we go eat something good?

18:46.208 --> 18:48.919
Let's not eat near the school.
I want to go somewhere far.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.004
Let's go.

18:58.512 --> 18:59.972
Hello, Ms. Na.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.892
Yes, I'm done with my finals.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.480
Okay.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.483
Did I gain weight?

19:12.192 --> 19:14.486
I ate too much because
I was stressed with finals.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.238
No, you didn't.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.574
You say that all the time.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.616
How was the exam?

19:20.826 --> 19:21.994
-Hello.
-Hi.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.831
About going on a field trip
to Kyung-seok mom's company,

19:26.373 --> 19:27.666
are there senior applicants?

19:28.292 --> 19:30.377
-Not that I know of.
-Is that so?

19:31.336 --> 19:33.881
-It might be quite awkward then.
-Are you going to apply?

19:35.716 --> 19:36.550
Never mind.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.302
It wouldn't look good for me to be there.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.139
Are you still mad?

19:43.348 --> 19:44.433
My goodness.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.894
-See you later.
-Bye.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.023
-What did you just do?
-What?

19:51.398 --> 19:53.400
Don't you know that he said
I was a fatty?

19:53.525 --> 19:55.402
How could you talk to him
like nothing happened?

19:55.861 --> 19:57.946
It's not like I'm never going
to see him again.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.783
Kyung-seok turned him into a mop.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.995
Even classmates care for each other.
What's wrong with you?

20:06.246 --> 20:07.080
Tae-hee.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.375
Tae-hee, let's go eat something good.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.377
Tae...

20:13.212 --> 20:14.504
Gosh, this is tiring.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.098
Dong-won, you must've been really hungry.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.311
Sorry I couldn't take care of you
because I was busy with finals.

20:30.979 --> 20:31.855
Is it good?

20:37.819 --> 20:38.987
Hello, Dong-won.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.825
<i>Guys, I think</i>

20:43.909 --> 20:46.328
<i>the beauty in my department</i>
<i>really has a crush on me.</i>

20:46.578 --> 20:48.247
<i>That's only your delusion.</i>

20:48.330 --> 20:53.543
<i>No, I'm telling you.</i>
<i>The name of her cat is same as my name.</i>

20:54.336 --> 20:56.838
<i>Maybe your name is Nabi or Kitty.</i>

20:57.381 --> 20:59.383
<i>It's rarely used to name a cat.</i>

20:59.591 --> 21:00.592
<i>It's for people.</i>

21:01.510 --> 21:02.886
<i>Can this be a coincidence?</i>

21:03.804 --> 21:05.806
<i>Can you still say that</i>
<i>she doesn't like me?</i>

21:13.814 --> 21:16.024
It must've been hard
studying for your finals.

21:16.108 --> 21:16.942
Eat up.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.069
Thank you.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.323
Let me do it.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.701
Moms usually do this for you.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.119
You should start eating.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.705
Thank you.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.128
By the way, didn't you want to say
something to me?

21:39.423 --> 21:41.508
Actually, I have a question.

21:43.135 --> 21:46.221
Nothing special has happened
to Kyung-seok, right?

21:49.766 --> 21:52.436
No, I don't think so.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.814
Then why did he dye his hair?

21:56.315 --> 21:58.900
Kyung-hee told me he doesn't care
about his looks.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.528
I'm not too sure about that,

22:02.112 --> 22:04.489
but he dyed his hair back to black.

22:04.573 --> 22:05.449
Really?

22:06.616 --> 22:10.329
I was worried I might look nosy
if I asked him about it directly.

22:11.913 --> 22:12.873
I see.

22:17.919 --> 22:20.505
I guess you're the one in trouble.

22:21.798 --> 22:22.632
Pardon?

22:23.133 --> 22:25.010
Are you worried about something?

22:32.601 --> 22:34.227
I guess you don't want to share.

22:34.686 --> 22:35.604
I'm sorry.

22:36.396 --> 22:37.356
That's not it.

22:40.525 --> 22:41.860
The thing is...

22:43.570 --> 22:46.865
TA, I want to apply for the field trip.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.116
Okay.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.747
LIST OF FIELD TRIP APPLICANTS

22:54.081 --> 22:56.500
-You're Hyun Sua, right?
-Yes.

22:58.460 --> 23:02.839
KO YE-NA, KIM TAE-HEE, YOO EUN,
JANG WON-HO, KIM SUNG-WUN...

23:03.799 --> 23:04.925
It's done.

23:05.008 --> 23:07.761
Thank you. Goodbye.

23:07.844 --> 23:08.678
Bye.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.141
Kyung-seok, are you here to apply for...

23:17.896 --> 23:18.730
What's wrong?

23:19.106 --> 23:21.483
Don't tell me you're here
to call off the rent issue.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.735
I'm here to apply for the field trip.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.821
-To Kelun?
-Yes.

23:31.493 --> 23:34.496
-Do better for your mom.
-That's my business.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.419
Are you mad at me?

23:43.713 --> 23:45.549
I'm done, right? Bye.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.558
I can't read his mind.

24:00.647 --> 24:01.815
You like him,

24:01.898 --> 24:05.193
and he seems to like you too.
Why do you have to give up?

24:08.321 --> 24:10.824
I think I'm scared.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.413
He's beyond my league.

24:17.414 --> 24:18.707
He's too perfect for me.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.625
Still, you two like each other.
So why?

24:23.795 --> 24:25.213
The thing is,

24:26.423 --> 24:28.633
a girl who's really pretty
has a crush on him.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.012
Everyone thinks
that they'd make a good couple.

24:33.346 --> 24:37.350
As you know, I got plastic surgery
all over my face.

24:38.351 --> 24:41.146
If he dates me, what will people say?
I'm just too scared.

24:41.897 --> 24:42.939
I see.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.526
I'm so stupid, right?

24:50.197 --> 24:51.031
But still,

24:51.907 --> 24:54.201
what matters is the fact that you two
like each other.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.244
So don't think about other people.

24:58.705 --> 25:01.583
That's what everyone else will say though.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.252
I understand.

25:04.336 --> 25:07.672
I'm sure many girls would feel
that way in your situation.

25:09.508 --> 25:13.762
I'm so mad at the people that made you
think that way.

25:15.805 --> 25:19.559
I don't know the details,
so I can't really give you advice.

25:19.935 --> 25:23.146
But perhaps, that pretty girl...

25:23.980 --> 25:27.567
isn't much different from you.

25:28.944 --> 25:32.906
I just don't want you
to have regrets later on.

25:38.411 --> 25:40.956
-Did you apply for the lab experience?
-Pardon?

25:46.253 --> 25:47.462
Let's eat.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.007
Have this too. Help yourself.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.218
Thank you.

26:02.519 --> 26:06.898
<i>Sua may not be that different from me?</i>

26:15.073 --> 26:16.491
Hello, Woo-young.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.828
I'm on my way home now.

26:19.953 --> 26:20.787
Mi-rae.

26:25.292 --> 26:26.209
Good timing.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.795
Hello.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.715
Can we talk for a minute?

26:32.882 --> 26:33.717
Sure.

26:34.134 --> 26:36.928
I noticed that you didn't apply.
Did you forget about it?

26:39.097 --> 26:40.015
No.

26:41.308 --> 26:44.144
I'm thinking of visiting my family
during summer break.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.733
But it's not for the whole summer.
You can visit them after you're done.

26:52.485 --> 26:55.989
I thought you'd apply for sure
since you're interested in perfume.

26:56.531 --> 27:00.076
More importantly, I think it'd be a good
chance for you to find out whether

27:00.160 --> 27:03.121
you are a good fit to pursue
a career in  the perfume industry.

27:05.081 --> 27:07.834
Also, there may not be another opportunity
to get hands-on experience

27:07.917 --> 27:10.378
at the perfume lab until you graduate.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.761
Can I apply still apply for the program?

27:18.428 --> 27:20.639
Of course, I'll add your name to the list.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.018
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.438
Woo-young.

27:31.274 --> 27:32.275
Thank you.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.696
Then are you free on Wednesday?

27:36.780 --> 27:37.739
Pardon?

27:37.822 --> 27:39.991
Let's watch a movie.
We can get a discount that day.

27:40.075 --> 27:43.495
Then I'll let Hyun-jung know as well.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.247
Just the two of us.

27:48.124 --> 27:50.085
I have something to tell you.

27:52.837 --> 27:53.713
Okay.

27:55.256 --> 27:56.091
Let's go.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.017
I've gained a little bit of weight.

28:37.424 --> 28:38.466
Hey, wait.

28:42.637 --> 28:43.763
Hello, Dong-won.

28:45.765 --> 28:46.725
I heard that...

28:49.102 --> 28:52.480
canned tuna is high in sodium.
You shouldn't give it to cats.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.691
If you still want to,
you should rinse it in water first

28:54.774 --> 28:56.943
to remove the oil and sodium
before giving it to them.

28:58.778 --> 28:59.654
Hey, Sua.

29:00.613 --> 29:02.365
Oh, hi.

29:03.491 --> 29:05.118
-Did you eat?
-Yes, what about you?

29:05.285 --> 29:06.244
I ate as well.

29:18.047 --> 29:19.424
Hi, Mi-rae.

29:19.674 --> 29:21.301
-Hello.
-Hi.

29:22.469 --> 29:23.928
Let's sit over there.

29:24.345 --> 29:25.180
Hello.

29:25.889 --> 29:26.723
Hi.

29:29.934 --> 29:32.020
Do you guys still work there part-time?

29:32.896 --> 29:34.230
No, we quit.

29:34.814 --> 29:35.815
Even Kyung-seok?

29:36.691 --> 29:37.525
Yes.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.572
Hello, Kyung-seok.

29:47.744 --> 29:49.704
I heard you quit the part-time job.

29:55.168 --> 29:58.338
He shouldn't have been involved
in that thing. I feel bad for him.

30:08.306 --> 30:11.601
Nice to meet you all.
I'm chief director, Lee Soo-hyun.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.979
This is Ms. Yun Soo-kyung, who will be
your guide through out the program.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.357
Hello, nice to meet you all.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.529
While getting hands-on experience
at the lab,

30:22.612 --> 30:25.365
you'll learn about theories and history
of perfume.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.659
If you have any questions or suggestions,

30:27.742 --> 30:29.744
feel free to speak to Ms. Yun.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.287
-Okay.
-Okay.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.083
Yes, come in.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.129
Why did you come to school today?

30:40.255 --> 30:42.715
-I'm taking a summer class.
-Oh, I see.

30:43.466 --> 30:47.095
-What brings you here?
-There's something I want to tell you.

30:47.971 --> 30:48.888
To me?

30:49.973 --> 30:51.641
I'm not that eloquent,

30:51.724 --> 30:54.519
so I wrote down what I want to tell you.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.198
Okay. Bye.

31:18.793 --> 31:20.712
<i>Dear Woo-young,</i>

31:20.795 --> 31:23.172
<i>I'm Kwon Yoon-byeol in sophomore year.</i>

31:23.715 --> 31:25.717
<i>I have a crush on you.</i>

31:25.800 --> 31:28.011
<i>You're very responsible</i>
<i>and have a strong sense of ethics.</i>

31:28.094 --> 31:31.055
<i>You respect women.</i>
<i>I like everything about you.</i>

31:32.181 --> 31:35.393
<i>I wrote this letter because I was too shy</i>
<i>to tell you in person.</i>

31:36.603 --> 31:38.354
<i>Best regards, Kwon Yoon-byeol.</i>

31:38.521 --> 31:40.523
Shy? She's so brave.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.860
Gosh, what should I do about this?

31:49.115 --> 31:51.492
First, go ahead and smell
the undiluted scents.

31:51.576 --> 31:55.496
Then, please write down which scents
are in the perfume I gave you.

32:05.632 --> 32:08.927
Because I've been smelling
all these different scents

32:09.052 --> 32:10.470
I can't even smell anything.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.389
You'll have to refresh your sense of smell
here and there.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.224
You can either take a break

32:15.308 --> 32:18.353
or try smelling coffee beans here.
It'll help as well.

32:41.542 --> 32:43.461
I think these scents are combined.

32:46.047 --> 32:48.967
Correct, you guessed every scent
in the perfume correctly.

32:51.427 --> 32:52.679
That's impressive.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.305
Are you Kang Mi-rae?

32:54.389 --> 32:56.349
You're the one who sent us
that perfume.

32:56.432 --> 33:00.353
Everyone in our lab loved that perfume.
We've been waiting to meet you in person.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.188
Thank you.

33:03.106 --> 33:05.650
You are a perfume expert.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.758
It didn't say it was going to rain.

33:37.682 --> 33:38.516
Woo-young.

33:40.518 --> 33:41.561
Woo-young.

33:42.645 --> 33:44.063
Wait, Woo-young.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.650
What were you thinking about?

33:49.152 --> 33:50.611
Well, just some things.

33:53.614 --> 33:55.033
Did you eat dinner?

33:55.116 --> 33:58.161
Oh right, I didn't even have lunch today.

33:58.244 --> 34:00.913
You didn't eat all day?

34:01.330 --> 34:02.457
That's bad.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.375
Thanks for your concern.

34:07.795 --> 34:08.629
Well...

34:09.547 --> 34:12.341
Do you want to eat dinner with me?

34:13.134 --> 34:14.302
Sure, what should we eat?

34:15.511 --> 34:19.431
Since today is hot,
let's go somewhere close.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.100
-Sure.
-Okay.

34:26.355 --> 34:27.732
-Welcome.
-Hello.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.484
-Hello.
-You can sit over there.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.409
He's still here.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.954
He's a part-timer, not the owner.

34:42.038 --> 34:43.121
Oh really?

34:47.085 --> 34:49.087
-He must've gone bankrupt.
-Exactly.

34:49.920 --> 34:50.755
You're here.

34:51.547 --> 34:52.715
What do you want? Beer?

34:54.842 --> 34:58.304
I don't think I'm good with perfume.
I can't even smell anything now.

34:58.387 --> 35:01.474
I liked it. I wasn't interested
in perfume, but it's really fun.

35:01.599 --> 35:03.392
-Right?
-Yes.

35:04.393 --> 35:07.730
Mi-rae, you look really interested.
You must really like perfume.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.988
-I'm hungry.
-But you already ate.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.491
Why are you sitting here alone
like a loner?

35:19.575 --> 35:21.119
I was a loner all my life.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.995
What would you have done without me?

35:23.454 --> 35:24.413
I know.

35:25.373 --> 35:26.499
Do you guys all want beer?

35:26.582 --> 35:27.667
-Beer sounds good.
-Great.

35:28.918 --> 35:31.212
Kyung-seok, what are you doing there?

35:32.296 --> 35:33.131
You should go.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.217
I can't be bothered.
I'm going to leave after this.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.593
Hey, Kyung-seok.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.428
Get over here.

35:39.512 --> 35:40.680
Kyung-seok.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.974
-Come on.
-Come sit here.

35:43.099 --> 35:44.433
Please just go.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.811
You're practically volunteering
to become a loner.

35:47.395 --> 35:50.481
I thought things were getting better.
But you're doing this again.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.861
-Kyung-seok.
-Come quick.

35:55.236 --> 35:57.530
Gosh, he's so cold-hearted.

36:07.665 --> 36:08.499
Something wrong?

36:11.252 --> 36:12.753
No, there's something on my mind.

36:13.921 --> 36:14.755
What is it?

36:20.720 --> 36:26.475
The thing is, someone confessed
that she likes me.

36:26.559 --> 36:27.393
What?

36:28.728 --> 36:29.854
Why are you so startled?

36:30.771 --> 36:31.689
Is it that shocking?

36:31.772 --> 36:33.774
No, it's not shocking.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.485
You're really popular.

36:36.569 --> 36:38.029
No, I'm not popular.

36:41.115 --> 36:42.491
What are you going to do?

36:44.619 --> 36:48.247
I'm just thinking about how
I'm going to turn her down.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.585
Have you already made up your mind?

36:52.668 --> 36:53.502
Yes.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.340
I can't suddenly like someone
just because that person likes me.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.011
You're very clear with what you want.

37:02.678 --> 37:04.764
I just know what kind of woman I like.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.643
Don't be too harsh though.

37:10.311 --> 37:14.523
Some people say you should be cold
when you reject someone.

37:15.107 --> 37:17.360
But if she's a decent person,

37:17.944 --> 37:21.781
she'd appreciate it
if you reject her politely.

37:24.575 --> 37:25.534
You're right.

37:25.952 --> 37:31.874
I feel like it'll be a scar for life
if the guy she likes says harsh things.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.920
I didn't experience it, but still.

37:37.129 --> 37:39.840
You understand even without experience
because you're a psych major.

37:43.469 --> 37:45.471
Isn't he good-looking?

37:46.138 --> 37:47.014
I'm not sure.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.433
I think On Seung-woo is handsome.

37:50.518 --> 37:52.144
I like guys who look cold-hearted.

37:53.854 --> 37:56.148
What about you, Sua?
Who's your favorite celebrity?

37:56.232 --> 37:57.066
Me?

37:57.692 --> 37:59.694
I don't know much about celebrities.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.113
I like guys who like me.

38:07.493 --> 38:08.744
What about you, Mi-rae?

38:09.203 --> 38:10.079
What?

38:10.830 --> 38:13.499
I've never heard you talk about guys.

38:14.583 --> 38:16.294
What kind of guys do you like?

38:20.548 --> 38:22.842
I haven't really thought about it.

38:23.843 --> 38:27.054
Do you like guys who treat you harshly?

38:27.138 --> 38:29.598
<i>You're the first girl</i>
<i>to treat me this way.</i>

38:29.765 --> 38:30.599
<i>Or...</i>

38:30.683 --> 38:33.227
<i>Let me become your firefighter.</i>

38:33.311 --> 38:34.729
<i>Do you like guys who are warm?</i>

38:34.812 --> 38:36.147
Which do you prefer?

38:36.731 --> 38:38.941
I just like the normal type of guys.

38:40.234 --> 38:42.445
What's the standard of normal?

38:42.528 --> 38:44.113
This is so frustrating.

38:44.196 --> 38:46.866
Let's just say you don't have
an ideal type.

38:49.452 --> 38:50.995
I like warm-hearted guys.

38:51.078 --> 38:53.789
-I'm going to leave.
-Kyung-seok.

38:54.373 --> 38:56.125
See you, Kyung-seok.

38:57.501 --> 38:58.669
Bye.

38:58.753 --> 39:01.422
It seems like he's becoming
more harsh.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.467
It's bothering me.

39:34.163 --> 39:35.331
<i>Take this.</i>

39:35.414 --> 39:37.375
It might start raining again.

39:41.504 --> 39:42.880
Okay.

39:43.839 --> 39:45.841
-Thank you.
-No problem.

39:47.259 --> 39:48.761
I'm the one who should thank you.

40:03.567 --> 40:04.860
Is that for Mi-rae?

40:07.238 --> 40:08.697
It's not for me, right?

40:08.781 --> 40:09.698
I told you...

40:10.991 --> 40:12.284
to cut it out.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.078
About what?

40:14.161 --> 40:16.080
Stop pulling tricks I don't understand.

40:17.164 --> 40:19.166
Why do you talk to me that way?

40:19.834 --> 40:22.211
I'm trying my best to become
friends with you.

40:23.003 --> 40:26.173
I sincerely like you.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.259
Even if I don't like you,

40:29.969 --> 40:32.346
I wouldn't have treated you like this
if you were sincere.

40:46.235 --> 40:47.820
Do you still not feel anything?

41:07.089 --> 41:07.923
Wait.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.097
You really don't feel anything?

41:19.477 --> 41:20.978
You must be mentally ill.

42:50.568 --> 42:51.777
Why didn't you answer my calls?

42:55.322 --> 42:56.448
Why did you run away?

43:01.120 --> 43:02.454
Because I saw her hug you.

43:03.706 --> 43:04.582
Are you okay?

43:07.459 --> 43:08.711
Did it upset you?

43:10.671 --> 43:14.258
I already told you that I'm not
interested in her.

43:23.267 --> 43:24.810
You'll get wet.

43:32.568 --> 43:33.902
Don't change the subject.

43:33.986 --> 43:35.988
Do you really not know?

43:38.240 --> 43:39.158
About what?

43:40.784 --> 43:41.744
That I like you.

43:45.998 --> 43:46.957
Let's go out.

43:48.250 --> 43:50.628
Don't try to avoid me and answer me
this time.

43:55.132 --> 43:55.966
Why?

43:57.509 --> 44:00.763
Why would a guy like you have
feelings for someone like me?

44:01.597 --> 44:03.599
What do you mean by a guy like me...

44:05.851 --> 44:07.561
and a girl like you?

44:11.273 --> 44:12.358
You already know.

44:18.197 --> 44:21.033
Can't you imagine what people will say
if we start dating?

44:22.618 --> 44:25.954
They'll wonder why such a guy
goes out with such a girl.

44:26.497 --> 44:27.373
So what?

44:28.749 --> 44:30.167
What do you think about me?

44:35.297 --> 44:36.131
You're someone...

44:40.094 --> 44:41.970
who can't be anything more than a friend.

44:42.930 --> 44:44.723
Forget about what can or can't be done.

44:45.140 --> 44:46.684
What do you think about me?

44:51.814 --> 44:52.690
I think...

44:55.609 --> 44:57.361
You and I can't be together.

45:02.324 --> 45:04.201
I told you before...

45:05.244 --> 45:08.956
People still think you're cool even if you
live your way. It's not the same for me.

45:09.790 --> 45:12.710
I was bullied throughout my school life
because I was ugly.

45:13.210 --> 45:15.838
And now, people gossip
about my plastic face.

45:15.921 --> 45:16.797
Hey.

45:18.382 --> 45:20.843
All I want to know is
what you think about me,

45:20.926 --> 45:22.219
not what other people say.

45:22.302 --> 45:24.596
What other people think is
important to me.

45:27.141 --> 45:30.185
You just think I'm obsessed
with appearances, don't you?

45:31.437 --> 45:34.523
You don't know how hard
it has been for me.

45:35.107 --> 45:36.984
If I'm with you,

45:39.278 --> 45:40.863
my life becomes torture.

45:44.908 --> 45:46.910
Even from the start,

45:50.956 --> 45:52.875
I didn't have a chance?

45:54.168 --> 45:55.002
No.

46:50.933 --> 46:55.062
<i>At last, it has ended this way.</i>

48:05.799 --> 48:08.510
-Hello.
-Hello.

48:08.844 --> 48:09.928
What?

48:10.012 --> 48:11.305
TO SUA

48:12.723 --> 48:14.349
Thank you for the drink.

48:15.642 --> 48:16.685
What?

48:23.483 --> 48:25.611
<i>Here's what happened with her today.</i>

48:25.694 --> 48:28.447
<i>She enjoyed the drink I gave her.</i>

48:28.530 --> 48:30.532
<i>We're flirting with each other, right?</i>

48:31.199 --> 48:34.286
<i>I think it's true that you get</i>
<i>a girlfriend when they enter college.</i>

48:34.369 --> 48:36.663
<i>I had no idea it'd be</i>
<i>a pretty girl like her.</i>

48:37.289 --> 48:40.250
<i>It must be true that pretty girls</i>
<i>don't go after handsome guys.</i>

48:40.334 --> 48:41.376
What is he saying?

48:49.176 --> 48:52.054
Sua, I thought you might not be able
to finish all the food you got,

48:52.137 --> 48:53.805
but you've actually finished it all.

48:54.139 --> 48:56.141
Sua usually doesn't leave
any of her food.

48:58.018 --> 48:59.144
But you're so skinny.

49:00.812 --> 49:03.190
I don't easily gain weight,
no matter how much I eat.

49:03.273 --> 49:06.151
She says that's her complex.

49:08.111 --> 49:09.696
There's no such thing.

49:09.821 --> 49:11.657
She's so annoying.

49:11.740 --> 49:12.783
Seriously.

49:12.866 --> 49:13.992
Hey, lower your voice.

49:47.109 --> 49:48.610
Let's talk for a minute.

49:53.782 --> 49:56.201
Did you eat lunch?

49:57.911 --> 49:58.829
No.

50:04.292 --> 50:06.586
If you're going through a hard time
because of me,

50:08.422 --> 50:09.798
I should stop doing that.

50:17.472 --> 50:18.807
But by any chance...

50:20.851 --> 50:23.854
if you think we can go back
to being friends...

50:26.398 --> 50:28.066
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

50:31.987 --> 50:32.863
But still...

50:37.117 --> 50:38.076
I'll wait.

50:59.473 --> 51:01.558
You're pretty, so stop
looking into the mirror.

51:03.143 --> 51:05.937
It's been a long time
since I heard you say I'm pretty.

51:06.980 --> 51:08.732
Back when you wanted to date me,

51:08.857 --> 51:12.819
you said it every time
you opened your mouth.

51:12.903 --> 51:14.905
I said that because you're pretty.

51:14.988 --> 51:17.032
You were the most beautiful woman
in our neighborhood.

51:17.115 --> 51:17.949
I know.

51:18.533 --> 51:21.703
When I was getting married to you,
everyone was shocked

51:22.412 --> 51:25.082
I chose a man for his personality,
not his background.

51:25.165 --> 51:27.459
They said even my heart was pretty.

51:27.542 --> 51:30.337
I was a successful businessman
back then.

51:30.420 --> 51:32.672
They got shocked again

51:32.923 --> 51:35.008
because this pretty woman
was living a bright life,

51:35.092 --> 51:38.386
even if her husband's business
went completely backrupt.

51:38.470 --> 51:42.432
Alright, you're going through a lot
thanks to your pretty face.

51:44.017 --> 51:46.937
Let's stop by that senior's house first
and go to Mi-rae's.

51:47.020 --> 51:49.940
It must be hard for you to carry
two watermelons alone.

51:51.108 --> 51:52.901
I'm okay.

51:53.318 --> 51:56.154
I can't make my pretty wife
carry them, even if it's hard.

52:01.993 --> 52:05.330
Do you think I look like Mi-rae?

52:05.413 --> 52:08.041
Do I look like Gangnam beauty's mom?

52:08.125 --> 52:11.378
Yes, you girls look very much alike.

52:11.920 --> 52:13.130
My goodness.

52:16.258 --> 52:18.260
What do you think
about your brother's place?

52:18.593 --> 52:20.303
I'd like to take a look inside, too.

52:21.054 --> 52:24.266
I'm glad that you two grew up
as affectionate siblings.

52:25.392 --> 52:26.226
Let's go.

52:33.358 --> 52:34.901
Who are you?

52:35.944 --> 52:38.029
-Are you Woo-young's mom?
-No.

52:38.697 --> 52:41.324
No, I'm the mom of Woo-young's junior.

52:41.950 --> 52:43.285
She lives near here.

52:44.411 --> 52:45.620
Near here?

52:46.538 --> 52:48.456
Are you Mi-rae's mom, by any chance?

52:52.085 --> 52:54.880
Nice to meet you.
I'm Do Kyung-seok's mom.

52:55.255 --> 52:57.174
He lives with Woo-young.

52:57.340 --> 52:58.758
He and Mi-rae are collegues.

52:58.842 --> 53:01.928
Do Kyung-seok?

53:02.012 --> 53:04.055
Oh, that pretty-looking man?

53:04.139 --> 53:06.474
Do you know him?

53:06.558 --> 53:10.061
-Yes.
-We know him. It's good to meet you.

53:10.145 --> 53:12.230
It's nice to meet you.

53:14.316 --> 53:17.986
I didn't think I'd meet with other parents
once my daughter entered college.

53:18.612 --> 53:20.989
I'm glad we met like this.

53:23.909 --> 53:27.162
Unfortunately, I couldn't be there
for my kids when they were younger.

53:28.622 --> 53:31.082
Watching Mi-rae grow must've
made you very happy.

53:31.291 --> 53:32.876
She's kind and smart.

53:32.959 --> 53:35.670
She also knows how to party.
She's a great dancer as well.

53:35.754 --> 53:37.088
Oh, really?

53:38.006 --> 53:43.011
I wondered who gave Kyung-seok
his good looks.

53:43.303 --> 53:44.846
He surely got it from you.

53:47.432 --> 53:49.017
You look so young for your age.

53:50.185 --> 53:51.811
You really are a Gangnam beauty.

53:53.855 --> 53:55.607
My mom didn't get any plastic surgery.

53:56.650 --> 53:57.734
What?

53:57.817 --> 53:59.110
That remark about Gangnam beauty.

53:59.194 --> 54:01.780
People say that to those who got
a lot of plastic surgery done.

54:34.521 --> 54:36.064
Great work, everyone.

54:36.147 --> 54:38.149
What you did today will take up
most of your time

54:38.233 --> 54:39.651
if you join a perfume lab later.

54:39.734 --> 54:42.028
Don't forget what you learned.
Write down everything, okay?

54:42.112 --> 54:43.613
-Okay.
-Okay.

54:50.245 --> 54:51.705
KOO TAE-YOUNG

54:52.539 --> 54:55.125
<i>Can we meet later today?</i>
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

55:53.975 --> 55:55.226
Hello, Woo-young.

55:55.518 --> 55:57.979
<i>-Are you done?</i>
-Yes.

55:58.730 --> 55:59.606
<i>Where are you?</i>

56:01.107 --> 56:03.151
I'm near the Kelun lab.

56:03.568 --> 56:05.028
<i>Where shall we meet today?</i>

56:05.320 --> 56:07.447
<i>Why don't we eat something good</i>
<i>after the movie?</i>

56:07.530 --> 56:08.365
Today?

56:12.118 --> 56:13.453
Right, okay.

56:41.439 --> 56:43.733
-Did you make a reservation?
-Yes, under Woo-young.

56:43.817 --> 56:44.859
Please wait.

56:49.197 --> 56:51.199
The movie was so good.

56:51.825 --> 56:54.369
That man's dance was hilarious.

56:54.452 --> 56:55.620
Yes, it was so funny.

56:57.080 --> 56:59.082
-Shall we grab a drink too?
-Drink?

56:59.833 --> 57:01.709
You know that I'm a lightweight.

57:02.377 --> 57:03.211
Right.

57:05.213 --> 57:08.591
I'm actually worse than you.
I can't drink more than two shots of soju.

57:09.467 --> 57:12.053
Really? I had no clue.

57:12.137 --> 57:14.472
There are many other things
you don't know about me.

57:15.181 --> 57:16.891
I don't like pork belly

57:16.975 --> 57:18.476
and I get cold very easily.

57:19.936 --> 57:21.396
I don't like studying

57:22.605 --> 57:23.940
and I like you.

57:33.283 --> 57:37.245
I was worried that things might get
awkward for you at school

57:37.495 --> 57:38.997
so I've been hesitant, but...

57:43.042 --> 57:45.336
I've had a crush on you
since we first met.

57:50.884 --> 57:52.594
I guess you had no clue.

57:58.391 --> 57:59.225
Why?

57:59.309 --> 58:00.310
What?

58:00.393 --> 58:02.479
Why do you like me?

58:06.900 --> 58:07.942
Because you're pretty.

58:11.988 --> 58:14.574
You always look grumpy,
as if you're bothered by something.

58:14.657 --> 58:16.701
But I notice the subtle differences.

58:19.370 --> 58:21.623
Today, it must be something very serious.

58:23.583 --> 58:27.295
If it's that serious, it must be about
something that's never happened before.

58:29.047 --> 58:30.340
It's about a girl, right?

58:34.010 --> 58:36.513
It must be. Hey, are you seeing someone?
Who is it?

58:37.430 --> 58:38.890
It's none of your business.

58:39.557 --> 58:41.017
I wonder who.

58:41.100 --> 58:43.603
Who's the girl that melted
this guy with the cold heart?

58:44.646 --> 58:47.398
-What's the problem though?
-She said she can't date me.

58:47.482 --> 58:49.275
What? She even rejected you?

58:50.318 --> 58:52.612
She said she can't,
not that she doesn't like me.

58:53.988 --> 58:55.031
I don't understand.

58:59.118 --> 58:59.994
Is she ugly?

59:00.912 --> 59:02.455
-No.
-Is she pretty?

59:02.539 --> 59:03.915
You don't like pretty girls.

59:05.041 --> 59:07.043
She's neither pretty nor ugly.

59:07.961 --> 59:09.087
She's just herself.

59:10.672 --> 59:13.007
You like me just because I'm pretty?

59:14.926 --> 59:16.928
All guys like pretty girls.

59:17.262 --> 59:18.388
You're my type.

59:21.516 --> 59:22.600
Are you surprised?

59:23.893 --> 59:24.727
Yes.

59:28.898 --> 59:31.109
I didn't know you were
that kind of person.

59:33.278 --> 59:34.112
What?

59:35.196 --> 59:37.865
Did you start liking me
just because of my looks?

59:40.868 --> 59:42.996
What's wrong with being attracted
to good looks?

59:43.871 --> 59:45.373
Are you not attracted to handsome guys?

59:46.457 --> 59:48.459
It doesn't have to be about good looks.

59:49.043 --> 59:51.045
Some like girls with double eyelids.

59:51.879 --> 59:54.632
Some are attracted to skinny girls
or girls with fair skin.

59:55.174 --> 59:56.718
Everyone has a type, you know?

59:59.429 --> 1:00:01.681
I told you I got plastic surgery
all over my face.

1:00:03.474 --> 1:00:07.520
I used to be very ugly.
To the point that you can't imagine.

1:00:09.522 --> 1:00:10.398
So?

1:00:11.899 --> 1:00:13.151
So why?

1:00:14.944 --> 1:00:17.697
I don't understand why you're
attracted to someone like me.

1:00:17.780 --> 1:00:18.948
Someone like you?

1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:22.535
You're attractive.

1:00:28.541 --> 1:00:30.418
It is partially because you're pretty.

1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:32.962
But my feelings for you continue to grow.

1:00:33.630 --> 1:00:34.797
I like the way you are.

1:00:56.235 --> 1:00:59.989
<i>To me, you're just yourself.</i>

1:01:05.370 --> 1:01:08.873
Coming home after confessing makes me
feel so awkward.

1:01:15.004 --> 1:01:16.047
Go in.

1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:18.841
Okay.

1:01:19.884 --> 1:01:21.177
Goodbye.

1:01:59.924 --> 1:02:00.925
Woo-young.

1:02:03.428 --> 1:02:06.222
-Woo-young.
-Mi-rae.

1:02:08.891 --> 1:02:11.227
-Woo-young.
-Catch your breath first.

1:02:12.937 --> 1:02:14.021
Well.

1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:19.402
You told me to think about it

1:02:21.863 --> 1:02:23.239
but I...

1:02:27.118 --> 1:02:28.119
I'm sorry.

1:02:34.333 --> 1:02:35.585
Okay.

1:02:36.836 --> 1:02:38.337
I got your point.

1:02:39.589 --> 1:02:40.631
I'm sorry.

1:02:40.715 --> 1:02:43.468
To be honest, I was prepared for this.

1:02:45.344 --> 1:02:46.512
I'm very sorry.

1:02:46.596 --> 1:02:47.805
Don't be.

1:02:48.514 --> 1:02:49.766
You don't have to feel bad.

1:02:50.725 --> 1:02:52.101
To tell you the truth

1:02:53.352 --> 1:02:55.646
I'm not too sure if I can do this to you.

1:02:57.190 --> 1:02:59.025
Who am I to reject you?

1:02:59.108 --> 1:03:00.193
Don't say that.

1:03:03.196 --> 1:03:05.323
It's not like some people don't
deserve to be loved

1:03:05.907 --> 1:03:08.493
or aren't allowed to be attracted
to someone.

1:03:09.535 --> 1:03:10.953
There's no such thing.

1:03:11.370 --> 1:03:13.247
No one has the right to laugh at you.

1:03:14.916 --> 1:03:15.833
Moreover,

1:03:17.210 --> 1:03:20.505
when you're attracted to someone,
you can't control your feelings.

1:03:27.136 --> 1:03:30.181
Good luck with Kyung-seok.

1:03:33.434 --> 1:03:36.145
I knew a long time ago that you two
liked each other.

1:03:37.730 --> 1:03:38.564
But...

1:03:39.690 --> 1:03:43.361
I still wanted to tell you
how I feel about you.

1:03:45.988 --> 1:03:47.323
Kyung-seok is a good guy.

1:03:48.032 --> 1:03:49.116
Plus, he's handsome.

1:03:51.035 --> 1:03:52.411
No, it's not that.

1:03:53.704 --> 1:03:56.374
You're handsome too.

1:03:56.958 --> 1:03:58.626
That's really not the reason.

1:03:59.961 --> 1:04:02.797
You're a great person.

1:04:07.468 --> 1:04:08.469
I'm okay.

1:04:09.011 --> 1:04:09.846
Don't cry.

1:04:22.692 --> 1:04:24.694
Just follow your heart, Mi-rae.

1:04:26.821 --> 1:04:27.697
So, don't cry.

1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:03.232
