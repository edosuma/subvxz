12:22.507 --> 12:25.174
He has clearly lost his mind,

12:25.176 --> 12:27.777
become the rat
I always knew he was.

12:27.779 --> 12:31.447

Take him to baxter stockman.

You know, mind-meld and stuff?

15:43.975 --> 15:46.909
- Hmm, based on my research
on telepathy,

15:46.911 --> 15:47.810
it might be possible.

15:47.812 --> 15:49.812

to hang our masks, sensei.

20:56.988 --> 20:58.020
Where are we gonna live?

20:58.022 --> 20:59.989

or maybe an abandoned
subway tunnel.

the greatest idea ever!

21:05.463 --> 21:07.496

to hear this?

21:07.498 --> 21:08.697
- It's secret, fortified,

21:08.699 --> 21:12.901

to look for us there.

perfect.

21:28.586 --> 21:30.819
