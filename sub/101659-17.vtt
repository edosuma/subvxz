04:17.558 --> 04:18.626

I'd like to get a 12-lead EKG,

04:53.861 --> 04:56.430

and bloodwork.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.932
Ordinarily, I'd be
thinking about volume
overload as the cause...

04:59.066 --> 05:01.635
But in this case, sodium
and B.U.N. are normal.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.905

I'd look at is a post-op

the troponins are normal.

impaired circulation,

blood flow from the heart,

10:24.591 --> 10:26.226
The tip of the catheter
would be likely

10:26.359 --> 10:27.795
to rupture
your weakened aorta,

10:27.928 --> 10:28.962
ripping it open
and causing you

11:01.628 --> 11:03.496
I could assist
with E.R. consults.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.436
Dr. Murphy, because
I'm being professional,

11:09.569 --> 11:12.105
you may not understand
how angry I am right now.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.880
Will you do
what Mr. Hill wants?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.181
What you want,
you mean?

11:22.649 --> 11:24.484
Yes, we'll do it.
You've forced our hand.

Honey, when Freya
brings you a dead rat,

11:48.776 --> 11:50.510
she's offering you
a gift.

11:50.643 --> 11:53.046
PETE: (CHUCKLES) I know.
I waited until she was gone

11:53.180 --> 11:54.347
so she wouldn't
see me toss it away.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.016
(CHUCKLES)
Wish you were here.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.517
You could strike
the right balance

11:57.650 --> 11:59.686
between enthusiasm
and discouragement.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.055
Oh. Honey, I gotta go.
My doctors are here.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.456
You sure everything
is okay there?

12:03.590 --> 12:06.226
Absolutely. These shots
are working like a charm.

12:06.359 --> 12:07.527
Love you!
Love you.

12:07.660 --> 12:08.661
Mwah.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.232
The shots are
not doing the job.

12:12.365 --> 12:13.901
What else do you
have for me?

12:14.034 --> 12:17.104
I had another episode.
It was shorter,
but still there.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.973
The MRI shows a branch
off the basilar artery

12:20.107 --> 12:21.374
that's compressing
the facial nerve.

12:21.508 --> 12:24.411
Unfortunately, you have
a "tortuous" artery.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.014
Where it should be straight,
it bends and twists.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.515
Bad news is,
it'd be a nightmare

12:28.648 --> 12:29.917
to try and address
this surgically.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.251
Good news...

12:31.384 --> 12:33.120
Is, other than
some twitching,

12:33.253 --> 12:35.222
which is minimized
by the Botox,

12:35.355 --> 12:36.523
it's not causing
any other problems.

keep happening,

12:48.535 --> 12:51.104
eventually one of them
will get caught on video.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.573
Ten minutes later,
it'll be all over
social media.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.608
My opponents will
mock me relentlessly.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.777
I think a lot of people
would have sympathy
for you.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.213
We don't vote for people
we feel sympathy for.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.949
We want strong leaders.

more than the reality.

with good reason.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.637
There's no need
to make him any more angry.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.472
That's why I'm hiding.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.141
I couldn't
wait in the lounge

14:34.274 --> 14:36.576
because the walls are glass
and people could see me.

What are you waiting for?

When they see
that I was right,
they'll let me come back.

I want to be prepared.

I'm reading about options
in aortic dissection.

14:44.151 --> 14:46.119
Shaun, no.
Yes.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.456
Once they do the angio,
they'll see the evidence.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.524
Dr. Andrews
won't be angry anymore.

14:51.658 --> 14:52.892
They did the angio.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.861
Mm.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.896
Oh.

No. No, they...
They couldn't.

They did it.

I was there.
You were wrong.

15:03.803 --> 15:04.837
But...

15:07.040 --> 15:09.242
Cold feet...
It was a focused angio.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.544
I saw the ascending aorta
and the aortic root.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.213
There was no sign
of dissection.

It takes months
to see any kind
of improvement.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.240
It's interesting.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.442
The fact that you like
this person makes you willing

17:22.575 --> 17:24.277
to make really
stupid decisions
that could kill her.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.084
We could meet
in the middle.

17:31.218 --> 17:34.487
Tortuous or not,
the main basilar
isn't causing the spasms.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.456

and just sling up

17:36.589 --> 17:38.125

Nice.

17:42.962 --> 17:44.264
I have two predictions
to make.

17:46.032 --> 17:47.867
One, she'll come up
with a rationalization

17:48.000 --> 17:50.703
to justify not telling
her husband
about this surgery,

17:50.837 --> 17:53.005
and two, you'll come up
with a rationalization

17:53.140 --> 17:55.175
to justify
forgiving her for that.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.680
You wouldn't have
fired him.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.853

you giving me
some slack once

18:10.223 --> 18:11.658

who I never liked,
by the way,

18:15.828 --> 18:16.796

Said I didn't love her enough.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.106
And I told her
I loved her,

18:27.240 --> 18:28.708
but I didn't have time
to get into it

18:28.841 --> 18:30.042

to reconstruct.

That's Penzer.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.400
Great mind, great hands,

he'd never be a surgeon.

Open the arachnoid plane

35:32.631 --> 35:34.566
Reduce the pressure
from the inside.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.268
For her,
it's worth the risk.

35:50.449 --> 35:53.084
There was a patient
admitted this morning
I think you should see.

35:53.219 --> 35:54.520
You thinking of
Mrs. Cavanaugh?

35:54.653 --> 35:56.588
That's a good idea,
Dr. Park.

35:56.722 --> 35:58.824
We'd welcome another take

35:58.957 --> 36:03.429
as to whether she's
a good candidate
for inserting an ICD.

36:03.562 --> 36:06.031
I'll consult just
on that question,
if you'd like me to.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.401
But I won't join
in the O.R.

36:10.402 --> 36:11.970
I'm quitting surgery.

36:12.103 --> 36:14.172
****

36:14.306 --> 36:16.608
I don't understand.
When did you decide...

36:17.943 --> 36:19.245
Fifteen minutes ago.

36:22.648 --> 36:25.617
I nearly closed up
without doing
a final antibiotic lavage.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.820
But you didn't.

36:28.954 --> 36:30.622
Nurse Barker prompted you
with the syringe.

36:32.324 --> 36:33.792
It was a tiny error.

36:33.925 --> 36:36.395
There was
no contamination
of the field.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.964
Many surgeons don't even
do a final lavage.

36:39.097 --> 36:42.368
I always told myself once
I started making tiny errors,

36:42.501 --> 36:43.969
I'd stop before
I made a big one.

36:44.102 --> 36:45.471
Paul,

36:45.604 --> 36:47.273
we almost lost
a patient today.

36:47.406 --> 36:48.139
You were still rattled.

36:49.741 --> 36:50.809
Thank you, Marcus.

36:52.678 --> 36:54.546
But I made this plan
years ago,

36:54.680 --> 36:57.249
because I knew
that when the time came,

36:57.383 --> 37:00.018
I'd look for reasons why
whatever I did wrong

37:00.151 --> 37:03.522
was tiny, minor,
didn't count.

37:05.190 --> 37:06.258
That's when
I made the rule.

37:07.326 --> 37:08.994
Everything counts.

37:09.127 --> 37:10.529

37:13.799 --> 37:17.369
Dr. Murphy,
it was nice
sewing with you.

You gave us a scare.

37:56.375 --> 37:57.709
But all good now.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.714
You're mad at me.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.215
About little Evvie.

38:04.350 --> 38:05.984
(SIGHS)

38:06.117 --> 38:08.420
Well, Evvie inspired me.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.324
I took strength from her
for years.

38:14.159 --> 38:15.193
Now it's all fiction.

38:17.996 --> 38:22.033
Fictional lives
can save real lives.

38:22.167 --> 38:26.104
Four years ago, I used that
story on the Senate floor.

38:26.237 --> 38:29.341
I got my bill passed
by one vote.

38:29.475 --> 38:33.311
That lie helped millions of
people with disabilities.

38:35.246 --> 38:37.115
I'm really proud
of that lie.

38:37.248 --> 38:39.518
****

38:53.098 --> 38:56.301
I'm heading out
to have a drink
with Dr. Nakano.

38:56.435 --> 38:59.938
Are you going
to try to talk him
out of leaving surgery?

39:00.071 --> 39:01.773
No.

39:01.907 --> 39:05.711
I'm going because
no one's meant
to shoulder loss alone.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.446
And I'm the one
who should be
with him tonight.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.615
Why?

39:10.982 --> 39:13.519
Because we love
the same thing.

39:13.652 --> 39:17.088
And he knows no one would
understand what he's lost
more than I would.

****

39:32.938 --> 39:35.173
****

39:40.546 --> 39:42.714
I have been thinking...

39:42.848 --> 39:45.183
About all the people
you've helped,
including me.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.854
And about not...

39:50.689 --> 39:52.524
Sharing the danger
you were in
with your husband.

39:54.259 --> 39:56.662
Probably not sharing
a lot of other things.

39:58.363 --> 40:02.033
And it struck me
that... (SIGHS)

40:02.167 --> 40:03.902
Being in a marriage
like that must be lonely.

40:08.039 --> 40:10.408
You can't
trust him to lie.

40:12.210 --> 40:15.914
So you end up
sharing more of yourself
with a guy like Cal,

40:16.047 --> 40:18.149
who is a hired gun
and who's gonna end up

40:18.283 --> 40:20.552
working for somebody else
two years from now.

40:25.390 --> 40:27.092
The fact that Pete and I
don't talk shop

40:27.225 --> 40:28.860
doesn't make our marriage
less than wonderful.

40:35.366 --> 40:36.367

40:56.421 --> 40:59.891
let's talk about the upcoming
climate change conference.

41:00.025 --> 41:01.793
I have to tell
you guys a story

41:01.927 --> 41:04.162
about a little boy who lives
on the Outer Banks

41:04.295 --> 41:05.997
of South Carolina,

41:06.131 --> 41:08.266
whose home is about to
be washed away...

** I think if I fail again

41:16.207 --> 41:20.411
** That I know
You're still listening

** Maybe it's all gonna
Turn out all right...

41:24.683 --> 41:28.253
(SIGHS)
I could get another mug,
or I could wash these.

41:28.386 --> 41:29.921
It's a tough decision.

41:31.289 --> 41:32.558
Mm.

41:32.691 --> 41:34.125
I should
probably tell you,

41:34.259 --> 41:35.794
I didn't get to
calling the landlord.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.198
And maybe
ten minutes ago,

41:40.331 --> 41:42.634
I saw a couple fruit flies
near the drain, so...

41:42.768 --> 41:46.672
** I have to believe that it is

41:46.805 --> 41:48.640
** Have to believe...

41:48.774 --> 41:51.777
(SIGHS) So... Yeah.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.916
(VOICE BREAKING)
Now it's my fault if we're...

41:58.049 --> 41:59.317
If we get bugs.

42:03.088 --> 42:07.693

42:07.826 --> 42:12.297
** Oh, it's not for my benefit

42:12.430 --> 42:17.736
** Maybe it's all gonna
Turn out all right

42:17.869 --> 42:21.072
** Oh, I know that it's not

** But I have to believe
