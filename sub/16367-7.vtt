00:27.842 --> 00:30.377
When last we left me...

00:30.379 --> 00:31.378
Cue music.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.902
As 1966 began,
I was determined

00:55.904 --> 00:58.505
to bring my studio,
Pinnacle Pictures,

00:58.507 --> 00:59.973
an Academy Award.

00:59.975 --> 01:02.876
First,
I needed the material.

01:02.878 --> 01:06.947
"She Cried for Justice"
was the novel of 1966.

01:06.949 --> 01:09.383
It told the story
of a Jewish girl

01:09.385 --> 01:11.752
who escapes Hungary
during the Holocaust

01:11.754 --> 01:13.520
and comes to America.

01:13.522 --> 01:16.423
Years later,
she sees her former Nazi guard

01:16.425 --> 01:19.860
living under an assumed name
in New York City.

01:19.862 --> 01:22.696
I knew from the moment
I read the first page

01:22.698 --> 01:25.599
this story had Oscar
written all over it.

01:28.336 --> 01:30.337
I called the author,
Edna Bach,

01:30.339 --> 01:31.872
and convinced her to meet.

01:31.874 --> 01:34.441
She was a recluse
who was not interested

01:34.443 --> 01:36.310
in dealing with Hollywood.

01:36.312 --> 01:39.413
So I wined and dined her.

01:39.415 --> 01:41.815
We sat at my favorite table
in the candlelit gardens

01:41.817 --> 01:43.350
of the Chateau Marmont

01:43.352 --> 01:45.619
and I laid on
the Wallach charm.

01:45.621 --> 01:48.855
"Edna, I simply must have the
rights to your memoir."

01:48.857 --> 01:51.525
She was tough,
"This is a sacred story

01:51.527 --> 01:53.427
"of my life, Mr. Wallach.

01:53.429 --> 01:55.529
"Why would I ever trust
a Hollywood producer

01:55.531 --> 01:57.064
to do it justice?"

01:57.066 --> 01:58.632
"Because I promise
to treat your story

01:58.634 --> 02:00.334
with the utmost respect.

02:00.336 --> 02:02.402
You will be involved
every step of the way.

02:02.404 --> 02:05.339
Your novel is beautiful.
Just like you."

02:05.341 --> 02:08.074
"Oh, Jerry,
I haven't had a warm embrace

02:08.077 --> 02:11.445
since the Taft Administration."

02:11.447 --> 02:13.480
By the next morning,
she had agreed.

02:13.482 --> 02:15.482
Then I got to work.

02:15.484 --> 02:17.784
For the lead role
of the Jewish refugee,

02:17.786 --> 02:18.885
Hannah Novak,

02:18.887 --> 02:20.387
I wanted to find an actress

02:20.389 --> 02:22.456
who was vulnerable,
yet resilient.

02:22.458 --> 02:25.459
Someone who, when the audience
looked into her eyes,

02:25.461 --> 02:28.795
they saw the horrors
of the Holocaust.

02:28.797 --> 02:30.897
But she had to be hot.

02:32.634 --> 02:35.936
Bridget Bailey
was the "It Girl" of 1967.

02:35.938 --> 02:39.005
She drove men
wa-wa-wa-wild.

02:39.007 --> 02:41.408
She was like whipped cream
and whiskey.

02:41.410 --> 02:44.111
Fluffy,
and God damn dangerous.

02:44.113 --> 02:46.513
She had just the right
va-va-voom

02:46.515 --> 02:48.148
to play
a Holocaust survivor.

02:49.951 --> 02:51.151
And for the male lead,

02:51.153 --> 02:52.819
the Gestapo officer,

02:52.821 --> 02:54.955
I was blessed with
the best method actor

02:54.957 --> 02:56.823
of his generation.

02:56.825 --> 02:59.526
You better believe
I went with my main wop,

02:59.528 --> 03:01.795
Enzo Entolini.

03:01.797 --> 03:04.030
At first,
Enzo wasn't up for it

03:04.032 --> 03:05.832
so I called him up.

03:05.834 --> 03:08.034
Enzo, wipe that spaghetti sauce
off your mouth,

03:08.036 --> 03:10.103
because I got
another project for you."

03:10.105 --> 03:12.439
But Jerry, I too common,

03:12.441 --> 03:14.641
I don't know nothing
about no Nazi.

03:14.643 --> 03:16.610
Enzo, I own the property.

03:16.612 --> 03:18.078
We can have our way
with this book

03:18.080 --> 03:20.480
the way we did
with those girls from Reseda.

03:20.482 --> 03:24.151
I like that memory.

03:24.153 --> 03:26.453
I had the cast
of my dreams,

03:26.455 --> 03:28.955
and we were ready
to bring the novel to life.

03:30.725 --> 03:33.093
Sometimes you throw
in the right ingredients,

03:33.095 --> 03:35.862
and out of the oven
comes a perfect movie.

03:49.678 --> 03:52.446
Hannah Novak
escaped Nazi Poland

03:52.448 --> 03:54.681
only to find
her tormenter here.

03:54.683 --> 03:56.750
This young,
Jewish refugee

03:56.752 --> 03:59.719
comes to this court
seeking justice.

03:59.721 --> 04:01.922
You say my client
was a war criminal?

04:01.924 --> 04:05.492
That man.
That man was Gestapo.

04:05.494 --> 04:07.127
And I know because

04:07.129 --> 04:10.597
I am a Jewish refugee.

04:10.599 --> 04:13.467
Can't you see...

04:13.469 --> 04:15.202
that I love you?

04:15.204 --> 04:16.470
Come here, ma.

04:23.879 --> 04:26.246
Their chemistry
was undeniable.

04:26.248 --> 04:28.782
There was just one problem.

04:28.784 --> 04:30.984
Our corporate owners
had no interest in owning

04:30.986 --> 04:32.819
an art house studio.

04:32.821 --> 04:35.622
Pinnacle Pictures
was independent for 40 years.

04:35.624 --> 04:38.592
But in 1951,
it was bought as a tax shelter

04:38.594 --> 04:40.994
by the CIA to funnel
South American money.

04:40.996 --> 04:42.963
It was an open secret
in Hollywood.

04:42.965 --> 04:45.232
Like how Kevin Costner
is three different people.

04:45.234 --> 04:48.134
Officially,
United Papaya of Uruguay

04:48.136 --> 04:49.736
controlled the studio.

04:49.738 --> 04:51.137
They didn't want me
futzing with

04:51.139 --> 04:53.206
their slush funds
and assassinations

04:53.208 --> 04:55.242
just to win an Oscar.

04:55.244 --> 04:58.111
They wanted to dump
Pinnacle Pictures all together.

04:58.113 --> 05:01.147
And sell off everything
I had built.

05:01.149 --> 05:03.149
But I knew how
to appeal to them.

05:03.151 --> 05:06.119
Through the magic of movies.

05:06.121 --> 05:07.954
I called down
to the sound stage

05:07.956 --> 05:09.923
and told them
to get the cameras ready.

05:16.264 --> 05:18.098
Hello, agents of the CIA.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.900
SeÃ±ores.

05:19.902 --> 05:20.901
I'd like to tell you
a little bit about

05:20.903 --> 05:22.636
Pinnacle Pictures,

05:22.638 --> 05:24.604
and what we have
going on here,

05:24.606 --> 05:27.807
and why we think
this movie studio isn't a front,

05:27.809 --> 05:31.211
but something with a front
and a back and sides.

05:35.049 --> 05:36.983
We have a lot of films
coming up on our slate

05:36.985 --> 05:39.152
at Pinnacle Pictures.

05:39.154 --> 05:41.688
One of which
is "Swashbuckler's Island,"

05:41.690 --> 05:43.256
a children's movie.

05:43.258 --> 05:45.258
And here's
one of the stars, now.

05:45.260 --> 05:49.863
Puffin, the bird.

05:49.865 --> 05:52.632
Puffin says he hopes
you like the film.

05:52.634 --> 05:55.101
And that it comes out in June
of this year.

05:55.103 --> 06:00.574
We're very proud of it.

06:00.576 --> 06:02.742
Puffin's proud of it, too.

06:02.744 --> 06:04.878
Another picture we're very...
proud of

06:04.880 --> 06:06.780
is "She Cried for Justice,"

06:06.782 --> 06:09.015
and Oscar contender starring
Bridget Bailey

06:09.017 --> 06:11.217
and Enzo Entolini.

06:11.219 --> 06:12.986
Now I want to show you
one clip from it.

06:12.988 --> 06:14.788
Just one.
And you'll see

06:14.790 --> 06:17.190
why Pinnacle Pictures
is the bet to make.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.095
It speaks for itself.
We need your money.

06:22.097 --> 06:25.131
But I promise you,
your name will be

06:25.133 --> 06:27.934
on an Academy Award.

06:27.936 --> 06:29.736
Or if you don't want your name
on any documents,

06:29.738 --> 06:30.971
that's fine, too.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.872
Maybe that's how
you guys work.

06:34.710 --> 06:36.376
The next morning,
we had the money

06:36.378 --> 06:39.646
in a black duffel bag,
all cash.

06:39.648 --> 06:41.214
Had some blood on it.

06:41.216 --> 06:43.950
Very upsetting
for the woman at reception.

06:48.924 --> 06:51.858
The movie opened
just in time for nominations.

06:51.860 --> 06:53.994
And sure enough,
we were in the running

06:53.996 --> 06:56.730
for Best Picture of 1967

06:56.732 --> 06:59.899
Two years of work,
assembling the finest cast,

06:59.901 --> 07:01.868
changing most of
the plot of the novel,

07:01.870 --> 07:03.737
banning Edna Bach
from the set

07:03.739 --> 07:06.072
and completely
changing the title

07:06.074 --> 07:08.041
but we were here.

07:08.043 --> 07:12.412
I knew we had the most
revolutionary film of the year.

07:12.414 --> 07:15.248
We've seen excerpts
from the five films nominated

07:15.250 --> 07:16.916
for Best Picture.

07:16.918 --> 07:18.718
For the record,
they are:

07:18.720 --> 07:20.220
"Bonnie and Clyde,"

07:20.222 --> 07:21.321
"Doctor Dolittle,"

07:21.323 --> 07:23.056
"The Graduate,"

07:23.058 --> 07:24.858
"In the Heat of the Night,"

07:24.860 --> 07:26.860
and "Blondes, Blondes, Blondes,
and a Millionaire!"

07:26.862 --> 07:29.396
Based on the novel,
"She Cried for Justice."

07:33.235 --> 07:34.434
And now for
the Best Picture.

07:34.436 --> 07:36.336
May I have
the envelope, please?

07:36.338 --> 07:39.706
Thank you.

07:39.708 --> 07:41.041
The winner is...

07:41.043 --> 07:43.109
"In the Heat of the Night,"
Walter Mirisch.

07:47.883 --> 07:50.150
Mary Poppins screwed me.

07:50.152 --> 07:52.085
I was so distraught
at the after party,

07:52.087 --> 07:53.953
I could barely speak.

07:53.955 --> 07:55.021
The only highlight
of the evening

07:55.023 --> 07:57.891
was that I discovered flan.

07:57.893 --> 07:59.893
"Blondes, Blondes, Blondes,
and a Millionaire!"

07:59.895 --> 08:01.695
was a victim of its time.

08:01.697 --> 08:03.863
I'll be honest,
I had no idea

08:03.865 --> 08:06.166
there was all this,
"young people are angry

08:06.168 --> 08:08.902
and Black people
are this and that" going on.

08:08.904 --> 08:10.770
I hung out with Enzo
and Playboy Bunnies

08:10.772 --> 08:12.372
and wealthy crooners.

08:12.374 --> 08:14.741
We talked about boats
most of the time.

08:14.743 --> 08:17.744
But I vowed never again
to be behind the times.

08:17.746 --> 08:20.714
I would dive into
the changing America.

08:20.716 --> 08:24.884
At age 41,
I embraced the revolution.

08:24.886 --> 08:28.788
I started smoking pot
and wearing leather vests.

08:28.790 --> 08:31.991
And that was it.

08:31.993 --> 08:35.195
So I...
I think it was late '67.

08:35.197 --> 08:40.265
It was just after Jerry had done
"She Cried for Justice."

08:40.268 --> 08:44.003
At any rate, I...
I came up and I said to Jerry,

08:44.005 --> 08:49.375
"A writer writes, a director
directs an actor acts.

08:49.377 --> 08:53.480
Tell me, just what is it
that you do?"

08:53.482 --> 08:55.749
And he just laughed and said,

08:55.751 --> 08:58.084
"Snakes..."

08:58.086 --> 08:59.486
He called me Snakes
for no reason.

08:59.488 --> 09:01.254
I don't get it.

09:01.256 --> 09:05.125
"Snakes, I'm the guy
who keeps the money men hard

09:05.127 --> 09:08.194
while making sure
you don't get fucked."

09:08.196 --> 09:10.463
I always liked that answer.

09:10.465 --> 09:12.899
Far out.

09:20.342 --> 09:23.309
As a new decade began,
I was more determined than ever

09:23.311 --> 09:27.814
to bring home an Oscar
by any means necessary.

09:27.816 --> 09:31.251
The 1970s saw the greatest
cinema boom in history.

09:31.253 --> 09:32.252
"The Godfather,"

09:32.254 --> 09:33.453
"Annie Hall,"

09:33.455 --> 09:35.555
"Jaws,"
and 700 other movies

09:35.557 --> 09:38.224
that don't hold up at all.

09:38.226 --> 09:40.260
And the Oscars
were changing, too.

09:42.329 --> 09:44.831
Oh, my God.
The winners is

09:44.833 --> 09:47.367
George C. Scott in Patton.

09:47.369 --> 09:51.404
Accepting the coveted award
for Mr. George C. Scott

09:51.406 --> 09:55.208
is the film's producer,
Mr. Frank McCarthy.

09:55.210 --> 09:57.477
George C. Scott
boycotted the Oscars

09:57.479 --> 10:00.280
and the son of a bitch
still won!

10:00.282 --> 10:02.415
Meanwhile,
Pinnacle Pictures continued

10:02.417 --> 10:04.484
to turn out
cutting edge films.

10:04.486 --> 10:06.352
I was determined
to keep up with the times

10:06.354 --> 10:09.856
by telling the grittiest,
most progressive stories

10:09.858 --> 10:12.559
about a year after they were
told in different movies.

10:12.561 --> 10:14.460
"French Connection"
too intense?

10:14.462 --> 10:16.329
How about
the heavily focus grouped,

10:16.331 --> 10:18.464
"Plan to Sell Dope"?

10:18.466 --> 10:20.300
"Love Story" too sad?

10:20.302 --> 10:23.269
Try "Going Steady,"
where no one dies at the end.

10:24.506 --> 10:26.372
"The Exorcist" too scary?

10:26.374 --> 10:28.274
How about
"Detective Rabbi"?

10:28.276 --> 10:31.544
He'll chase the Dybbuk
right out of your room.

10:31.546 --> 10:33.880
The Academy loved
a political film.

10:33.882 --> 10:36.516
But more importantly,
it loved a political protest

10:36.518 --> 10:38.418
on Oscar night.

10:38.420 --> 10:41.354
When Marlon Brando sent the
Land-O-Lakes Butter mascot

10:41.356 --> 10:42.555
to refuse his Oscar,

10:42.557 --> 10:45.258
I knew the bar had been set.

10:45.260 --> 10:47.627
If he was gonna
bring one Native American,

10:47.629 --> 10:51.130
I was gonna show up
with a whole tribe.

10:51.132 --> 10:54.267
When a Pinnacle film
was nominated in 1975,

10:54.269 --> 10:56.436
I arrived
with seven Brazilian men

10:56.438 --> 11:00.039
from the indigenous
Yanomami Tribe.

11:00.041 --> 11:01.975
If we won,
I promised the fellas

11:01.977 --> 11:04.377
they could rush the stage,
grab the award,

11:04.379 --> 11:07.580
and say whatever the hell
about the rain forest.

11:07.582 --> 11:12.018
The nominees for
the Best Picture of the year are...

11:12.020 --> 11:14.888
"Chinatown,"
a Robert Evans production,

11:14.890 --> 11:16.489
Robert Evans producing.

11:16.491 --> 11:19.592
"The Conversation,"
a Directors Company production,

11:19.594 --> 11:21.394
Fred Roos, co-producer.

11:21.396 --> 11:24.564
"The Godfather: Part II,"
A Coppola Company production,

11:24.566 --> 11:26.900
Francis Ford Coppola,
producer.

11:26.902 --> 11:29.135
"Lenny,"
a Marvin Worth production,

11:29.137 --> 11:30.670
Marvin Worth, producer.

11:30.672 --> 11:34.073
And "Kenny,"
a Pinnacle Production

11:34.075 --> 11:37.076
Jerry Wallach, producer.

11:38.212 --> 11:44.150
And the winner is...

11:44.152 --> 11:45.685
- "Godfather: Part II."
- God damn it!

11:45.687 --> 11:49.289
Francis Ford Coppola,
Gray Frederickson and Fred Roos.

11:53.328 --> 11:55.695
I'd been making films
for almost ten years.

11:55.697 --> 11:58.598
And not a single statue
graced my mantle.

12:01.569 --> 12:04.370
It was at that low moment
that my indigenous friends

12:04.372 --> 12:06.706
introduced me
to the cocaine leaf.

12:06.708 --> 12:09.275
Ten times more potent
than the stepped-on powder

12:09.277 --> 12:10.710
sold in L.A.

12:10.712 --> 12:12.512
For the rest of the 70s,

12:12.514 --> 12:15.181
I lived like
a jacked-up koala.

12:20.121 --> 12:22.055
I felt great.

12:22.057 --> 12:24.624
And a little violent
all day.

12:24.626 --> 12:26.459
I worked harder
than I ever had,

12:26.461 --> 12:29.262
turning out more and more
Oscar contenders.

12:43.545 --> 12:47.313
In 1977, Oscar-winning
screenwriter Michael Walters

12:47.315 --> 12:49.615
told me about a new
psycho-sexual drama

12:49.617 --> 12:51.050
he was writing.

12:51.052 --> 12:52.719
Walters was a mad genius,

12:52.721 --> 12:54.520
writing only at night

12:54.522 --> 12:57.690
and only typing with
the front ends of handguns.

12:57.692 --> 13:00.460
I bought the script
sight-unseen.

13:00.462 --> 13:02.395
And then I called
the one guy I knew

13:02.397 --> 13:03.763
who could direct it.

13:03.765 --> 13:06.466
The Roman Polanski...

13:06.468 --> 13:07.767
of Italy.

13:07.769 --> 13:10.036
My best friend,
Enzo Entolini,

13:10.038 --> 13:12.572
who had never directed
anything before.

13:12.574 --> 13:14.440
Entolini needed money.

13:14.442 --> 13:16.209
He'd invested
every dime he had

13:16.211 --> 13:18.177
in the sparking water
business.

13:18.179 --> 13:19.746
The Caps weren't shut
tight enough,

13:19.748 --> 13:22.515
and the whole supply
went flat.

13:22.517 --> 13:24.317
They worked
night and night

13:24.319 --> 13:26.686
in a special mirrored office
I had made for them.

13:26.688 --> 13:30.223
We were determined to make
the coke-iest movie ever.

13:30.225 --> 13:31.691
In an effort
to add to the whole,

13:31.693 --> 13:33.526
"What the fuck?"
of this production,

13:33.528 --> 13:35.428
we decided to cast
no-name actors

13:35.430 --> 13:37.263
who can
improvise dialogue.

13:37.265 --> 13:39.332
And on top of that,
Enzo and Walters

13:39.334 --> 13:42.035
insisted on shooting
on real locations

13:42.037 --> 13:43.403
with no permits

13:43.405 --> 13:46.672
and with no green lights
at crosswalks.

13:46.674 --> 13:49.475
I put every dollar we had
behind the project.

13:49.477 --> 13:51.377
The press was
gunning for me.

13:51.379 --> 13:53.780
We were now in the era when
overages and release dates

13:53.782 --> 13:56.249
were the stuff of
the nightly news.

13:56.251 --> 13:58.418
Still, I knew
we had the goods.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.120
A bondage-themed,
improvised movie

14:01.122 --> 14:04.290
with borderline-unattractive
no-name actors.

14:04.292 --> 14:06.426
The anticipation
for our masterpiece

14:06.428 --> 14:08.594
kept growing and growing.

14:11.699 --> 14:14.167
On May 25th, 1977,

14:14.169 --> 14:16.736
"Fisting"
opened worldwide...

14:16.738 --> 14:19.372
the same day as
"Star Wars."

14:19.374 --> 14:21.174
Was "Fisting"
a better movie?

14:21.176 --> 14:22.642
You bet it was.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.410
Can you rent it anywhere?

14:24.412 --> 14:25.511
Not really.

14:25.513 --> 14:26.846
One store has it.

14:26.848 --> 14:28.648
The point is,
we lost a ton of dough

14:28.650 --> 14:30.783
and once again,
I had to go beg for money

14:30.785 --> 14:32.718
to keep Pinnacle running.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.754
Hello, agents of the CIA.

14:34.756 --> 14:36.589
SeÃ±ores.

14:36.591 --> 14:40.359
Me and the fellas
would just like to apologize

14:40.361 --> 14:42.695
for...
not getting you the Oscar.

14:42.697 --> 14:44.363
Look, if it isn't Puffin.

14:44.365 --> 14:46.199
From our newest film,

14:46.201 --> 14:48.668
"Swashbuckler Island,"
from 12 years ago.

14:48.670 --> 14:51.304
Puffin...

14:51.306 --> 14:52.672
You're the only one
I trust, Puffin.

14:55.243 --> 14:58.444
Rosie, Dale.

14:58.446 --> 15:00.413
This is the the team
that's gonna put

15:00.415 --> 15:03.549
Pinnacle Pictures
back on the map.

15:03.551 --> 15:06.385
This time,
the film didn't work.

15:06.387 --> 15:09.155
And I got the shock
of my life.

15:15.229 --> 15:16.762
After 13 years
working to rig

15:16.764 --> 15:18.664
an Oscar
for Pinnacle Pictures,

15:18.666 --> 15:20.299
I was fired.

15:20.301 --> 15:22.435
Some men would see this
as a bottom.

15:22.437 --> 15:26.672
I saw it as the top
of a new and weirder mountain.

15:26.674 --> 15:28.608
I was going solo.

15:40.287 --> 15:41.654
I ran my production company

15:41.656 --> 15:43.322
out of my beautiful home,

15:43.324 --> 15:44.924
Villa Casalati.

15:44.926 --> 15:47.393
The future looked as good
as a blonde

15:47.395 --> 15:50.429
with long,
flat buttocks.

15:50.431 --> 15:51.464
Little did I know,

15:51.466 --> 15:52.565
what lay ahead of me

15:52.567 --> 15:54.734
was 10 more years of losing.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.402
The winner is...

15:56.404 --> 15:59.539
"Chariots of Fire."

15:59.541 --> 16:01.841
In '82, I lost
to "Chariots of Fire,"

16:01.843 --> 16:04.410
which is, at best,
a soundtrack

16:04.412 --> 16:06.579
that your mother has
in her car.

16:06.581 --> 16:11.584
In 1988, I made $200 million
with "Robot Bachelor."

16:11.586 --> 16:12.952
And the winner is...

16:12.954 --> 16:15.388
"Rain Man,"
Mark Johnson, producer.

16:15.390 --> 16:19.258
And lost to "Tootsie Counts
Cards in Vegas."

16:19.260 --> 16:21.794
Throughout the 1980s and '90s,
I made millions

16:21.796 --> 16:24.330
as I pivoted
to win the gold.

16:24.332 --> 16:25.598
Here's a period piece.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.799
No dice?

16:26.801 --> 16:28.801
All right, a biopic.

16:28.803 --> 16:30.803
Not this year?

16:30.805 --> 16:32.438
How about
an underdog sports movie

16:32.440 --> 16:34.440
with Meat Loaf as the coach?

16:34.442 --> 16:36.275
Get out of your office?

16:36.277 --> 16:37.743
Whatever you say, lady.

16:37.745 --> 16:39.879
The breaking point
was in the mid-1990s,

16:39.881 --> 16:42.648
when my Wyatt Earp movie,
"Mr. Old West"

16:42.650 --> 16:44.617
went head to head
with "Tombstone"

16:44.619 --> 16:46.519
and "Wyatt Earp."

16:46.521 --> 16:48.254
None of us were nominated

16:48.256 --> 16:50.957
and "Forrest Gump"
won Best Picture.

16:50.959 --> 16:53.259
"Forrest Gump."

16:53.261 --> 16:54.860
I'm sorry,
but what the fuck

16:54.862 --> 16:56.762
is the message of that movie?

16:56.764 --> 16:59.765
If you're dumb enough,
you can meet three presidents?

16:59.767 --> 17:01.567
It was all too much.

17:01.569 --> 17:03.736
My heart couldn't take it.

17:03.738 --> 17:05.605
My doctor told me
I could be happy

17:05.607 --> 17:07.973
with the millions
of dollars I had,

17:07.976 --> 17:11.477
or I could
chase Oscars and die.

17:11.479 --> 17:13.378
My life was a mess.

17:13.381 --> 17:14.814
I needed to get smart,

17:14.816 --> 17:16.616
wisen up,
kick the stupid

17:16.617 --> 17:18.884
out of my brain
and rev the Corvette.

17:18.886 --> 17:21.387
Clean and sober,
I dedicated my life

17:21.388 --> 17:23.021
to doing good.

17:23.023 --> 17:24.589
Here we go, everybody.

17:24.592 --> 17:26.492
We're doing charity work.

17:26.493 --> 17:28.361
With some donations
from AFI

17:28.363 --> 17:29.996
and every major studio,

17:29.998 --> 17:32.265
I started
Lights, Camera, Hope!

17:32.267 --> 17:33.966
The first charity
to give state of the art

17:33.968 --> 17:38.537
cameras and boom mics
to L.A.'s most dangerous gangs.

17:38.539 --> 17:40.006
Something magical
is happening down here

17:40.008 --> 17:42.675
in God knows where,
South Los Angeles.

17:42.677 --> 17:44.610
Hardened youths
are putting down their guns

17:44.612 --> 17:46.545
and picking up
a different kinda weapon:

17:46.547 --> 17:48.047
A movie camera.

17:48.049 --> 17:50.449
It's Lights, Camera, Hope!

17:52.853 --> 17:54.353
Lights, Camera, Hope!
helped me

17:54.355 --> 17:56.422
get over
my Oscar obsession.

17:56.424 --> 17:58.858
All I wanted to do
was charity work.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.793
So much so,
that I simultaneously

18:00.795 --> 18:02.995
lobbied the Academy
to make a special award

18:02.997 --> 18:05.831
for showbiz people
who do charity work.

18:05.833 --> 18:07.767
The proudest moment
of my life

18:07.769 --> 18:10.436
was when the Jerry Wallach
Humanitarian Oscar

18:10.438 --> 18:13.572
was presented
for the first time.

18:13.574 --> 18:15.474
And now, presenting
the Jerry Wallach

18:15.476 --> 18:16.976
Humanitarian Award,

18:16.978 --> 18:18.844
please welcome,
Anne Hathaway.

18:23.584 --> 18:25.351
Hello.

18:25.353 --> 18:28.421
It is my honor
to present the first ever

18:28.423 --> 18:31.390
Jerry Wallach
Humanitarian Award.

18:31.392 --> 18:33.459
- We at the Academy...
- I was about to

18:33.461 --> 18:35.061
receive an Oscar.

18:35.063 --> 18:37.863
The bald boy from Brooklyn
who only wanted

18:37.865 --> 18:39.465
to make people smile.

18:39.467 --> 18:42.468
It was finally
Jerry Wallach's night.

18:42.470 --> 18:43.903
To read the nominees

18:43.905 --> 18:49.008
for the Jerry Wallach
Humanitarian Award.

18:49.010 --> 18:50.576
Sidney Poitier,

18:50.578 --> 18:53.412
for the Poitier Center
for Racial Harmony.

18:57.884 --> 19:01.454
Paul Newman, for the
Newman's Own Foundation.

19:01.456 --> 19:04.857
Hey, Paul.

19:04.859 --> 19:07.626
Jerry Wallach,
producer of "Fisting."

19:10.498 --> 19:15.768
And Enzo Entolini for his
Italian Don't Litter campaign.

19:18.773 --> 19:21.907
And the Jerry Wallach
Oscar goes to,

19:21.909 --> 19:24.410
of course,
Enzo Entolini.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.524
Leave it to Julie Andrews'
little minion

19:38.526 --> 19:40.760
to fuck me over.

19:47.902 --> 19:49.668
Grazie mille.
Grazie.

19:49.670 --> 19:51.070
Was I mad at Enzo?

19:52.540 --> 19:54.173
Not on your life.

19:54.175 --> 19:57.676
Enzo saved my ass
many times.

19:57.678 --> 20:00.679
Enzo was the longest
relationship of my life.

20:00.681 --> 20:01.914
Forget my money.

20:01.916 --> 20:03.182
Forget my wives.

20:03.184 --> 20:04.884
Forget my four sons.

20:04.886 --> 20:09.188
Enzo was truly
my best friend.

20:09.190 --> 20:11.690
And I miss him
every God damn day.

20:15.663 --> 20:19.198
Now I spend my days
awash in a cologne cold memory.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.802
It stinks of regret
like a diaper in a hot car.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.704
Each spray
a jolt to the past.

20:25.706 --> 20:28.007
So many missed opportunities.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.876
So many awards
given to my lessers.

20:30.878 --> 20:33.879
My career is in the past.

20:33.881 --> 20:35.648
The door is closing.

20:35.650 --> 20:37.183
The curtain is falling.

20:37.185 --> 20:39.185
The waiter
is bringing the check.

20:39.187 --> 20:41.620
The masseuse has stepped out
of the room

20:41.622 --> 20:45.524
and reminded me
where my robe is.

20:45.526 --> 20:48.027
I will never make
another movie again.

20:48.029 --> 20:49.562
It's over.

20:49.564 --> 20:52.097
Fin.

20:52.099 --> 20:53.799
Next stop...

20:53.801 --> 20:55.134
death.

20:59.974 --> 21:01.540
Or...

21:01.542 --> 21:03.008
Hold on.
Hold on everybody,

21:03.010 --> 21:04.844
I got an idea
for a movie.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.512
Racism.

21:06.514 --> 21:08.113
We do a movie
about different people

21:08.115 --> 21:10.516
of different races
not getting along.

21:10.518 --> 21:11.884
Put a lot of
movie stars in it.

21:11.886 --> 21:13.786
Right?
That's a thing.

21:13.788 --> 21:14.920
Right?
Am I right?

21:22.800 --> 21:25.800
