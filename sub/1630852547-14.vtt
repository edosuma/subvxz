00:06.081 --> 00:07.414
♪<i> Meow, meow, meow, meow</i> ♪

00:07.566 --> 00:10.250

you fell for that again.

00:10.402 --> 00:12.011
The answer is me.

You're her boyfriend.
Make it stop.

I think it's cute.

00:20.079 --> 00:21.912
Okay, I can't with this today.

00:21.930 --> 00:23.671
Why so cranky, spanky?

00:23.691 --> 00:25.916
I got new neighbors,
and they kept me up all night.

00:25.934 --> 00:29.361
Oh. Were they fighting
or were they, uh, "fighting"?

00:29.588 --> 00:31.196
My neighbors bang on the wall

00:31.348 --> 00:33.615
when Glen and I get to ruttin'.

00:34.777 --> 00:36.744
I'm a screamer.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.687
They were definitely fighting,

00:39.707 --> 00:41.932
unless their pet names for
each other are "nagging bitch"

00:41.950 --> 00:43.709
and "lazy asshat."

00:44.620 --> 00:46.937
-So, I had kind of a brainstorm.
-Ooh.

00:46.955 --> 00:50.031
Lucky for you,
I brought my brain umbrella.

00:50.776 --> 00:53.944
My sister Mariella's daughter
Gracie takes piano lessons

00:54.113 --> 00:55.220
from this woman Nicole,

00:55.297 --> 00:56.538
and I was thinking
we set her up with Max.

00:56.632 --> 00:59.783
Which one?
Mariella, Gracie or Nicole?

00:59.952 --> 01:01.226
Well, Mariella's married,

01:01.378 --> 01:03.954
Gracie's six and quote,
"doesn't want to be tied down,"

01:03.972 --> 01:05.380
so that leaves Nicole.

01:05.474 --> 01:06.473
What's she like?

01:06.567 --> 01:07.791
She seems super cool.

01:07.810 --> 01:09.126
She just moved back
from New York.

01:09.144 --> 01:10.477
Ooh, and she used to be
a gymnast.

01:10.646 --> 01:12.220
Uh, that's probably more for Max
than you.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.906
If she can teach me
to do a cartwheel,

01:14.057 --> 01:15.074
then that is for me.

01:15.301 --> 01:17.076
I would love to see Max
find somebody.

01:17.227 --> 01:18.893
Me, too.
It doesn't make any sense.

01:18.913 --> 01:21.497
If I were that good-looking,
I'd have ten girlfriends.

01:22.065 --> 01:23.473
All named Kat.

01:23.567 --> 01:24.991
Yeah, you know, maybe
the four of us should go out.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.643
Take the pressure off.

01:26.662 --> 01:28.312
You just want her to teach you
to cartwheel, don't you?

01:28.330 --> 01:30.714
All the kids could do them
and I couldn't.

01:32.742 --> 01:33.667
Ta-da!

01:34.486 --> 01:37.579
And yet your back hurt too much
to take the trash out?

01:37.598 --> 01:38.913
Yeah.

01:38.933 --> 01:41.308
It was all that ruttin'.

01:47.833 --> 01:48.849
You guys okay with this place?

01:49.001 --> 01:50.016
Yeah, this is great.

01:50.093 --> 01:51.610
I drive by it every day
and say,

01:51.761 --> 01:53.687
"I wish I was the type of
person who hangs out there,"

01:53.839 --> 01:55.172
and look at me now.

01:55.265 --> 01:56.356
Should we get some drinks?

01:56.508 --> 01:57.950
(chuckles) I teach piano
to eight-year-olds,

01:58.101 --> 01:59.952
the answer is
always gonna be yes.

02:00.103 --> 02:01.528
Yeah, Oscar said
you're a music teacher.

02:01.605 --> 02:02.679
That's so cool.

02:02.698 --> 02:04.772
Is it? 'Cause today
Kyle Jenkins asked

02:04.792 --> 02:06.199
if I was alive
during pilgrim times

02:06.293 --> 02:07.851
and threw up on my shoes.

02:07.870 --> 02:09.611
Not these. I changed.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.855
Well, I get it,
I work with cats.

02:11.874 --> 02:13.799
But at least with them you get
a little advance warning.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.783
(mimics cat retching)

02:15.878 --> 02:17.194
MAX:
Anyway, okay.

02:17.287 --> 02:18.545
(chuckles)

02:18.714 --> 02:20.547
Oscar tells me that you lived
in New York for a while.

02:20.641 --> 02:24.034
Yeah, I spent three years
trying to break into Broadway.

02:24.052 --> 02:24.885
Finally got into<i> Wicked.</i>

02:24.979 --> 02:26.478
Oh, that's awesome, what part?

02:26.630 --> 02:27.813
Audience member.

02:28.056 --> 02:30.056
But when I sang "Popular"
in the restroom at intermission,

02:30.209 --> 02:31.817
the woman in the next stall
clapped.

02:32.044 --> 02:33.301
Are you sure
she was applauding you?

02:33.470 --> 02:35.136
She might've just been
proud of her work.

02:35.156 --> 02:36.897
(laughs) Great.

02:36.973 --> 02:39.383
You just killed the highlight
of my Broadway career.

02:39.551 --> 02:41.809
(both laughing)

02:41.829 --> 02:43.904
(laughs forcefully)

02:44.814 --> 02:47.240
You know, I took Max
to his first musical ever.

02:47.393 --> 02:49.651
I don't like to brag,
but did I change his life?

02:49.728 --> 02:50.836
Yes, I did.

02:51.063 --> 02:52.078
What was it?

02:52.173 --> 02:53.397
<i> Billy Elliot.</i>

02:53.415 --> 02:54.398
He cried twice.

02:54.416 --> 02:56.991
I mean, he just wanted to dance.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.160
And he did.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.846
You know,
Max is a musician, too.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.347
He sings and writes
his own songs.

03:02.574 --> 03:03.407
Oh.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.741
Yeah, in college,
we kind of ruled

03:04.834 --> 03:06.018
the Louisville karaoke scene.

03:06.169 --> 03:07.411
At any moment,
we're just a nudge away

03:07.429 --> 03:09.262
from "Don't Go Breaking
My Heart."

03:09.415 --> 03:10.856
Sometimes
they don't even need a nudge.

03:11.007 --> 03:13.192
Perhaps you've heard of us,
SilverBird?

03:13.343 --> 03:16.436
Kat Silver. Max Kingbird.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.013
Well, my last name is Tweedy,
so...

03:19.107 --> 03:20.941
Oh, my God, TweedyBird?

03:21.035 --> 03:22.534
Totally in.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.621
Yeah, combining names is
kind of our thing.

03:26.690 --> 03:28.615
Don't worry, babe, we can be OK.

03:28.692 --> 03:30.133
You get it?

03:30.193 --> 03:32.711
Oscar? Kat? OK.

03:32.862 --> 03:33.954
(Kat chuckles)

03:34.106 --> 03:35.547
Not okay.

03:40.128 --> 03:41.478
Hurry up and get in the bedroom.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.796
Oh, I thought we were
going out to dinner,

03:42.890 --> 03:43.947
but you know what?

03:43.966 --> 03:45.641
Th-This is way better.

03:50.472 --> 03:52.973
What-what are you doing?
Put those back on!

03:53.067 --> 03:55.959
Seems counterproductive
but okay.

03:55.978 --> 03:58.052
Shh! Just listen.

03:58.146 --> 03:59.646
DOUG:
Who you texting with now?

03:59.798 --> 04:00.722
Is that him?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.223
CARLIE:
It's a work text, Doug!

04:02.317 --> 04:03.467
You'd understand that
if you had a job!

04:03.485 --> 04:05.393
-(arguing continues)
-What is happening?

04:05.412 --> 04:07.153
Okay, that's Carlie,
she's a nurse.

04:07.248 --> 04:08.730
She works a lot
and she's having an affair

04:08.824 --> 04:10.064
with a doctor named Brad

04:10.158 --> 04:11.324
while Doug is
out playing pickleball.

04:11.477 --> 04:13.159
Wait, what the hell is
pickleball?

04:13.254 --> 04:16.313
I don't know,
but he spent $500 on a paddle,

04:16.406 --> 04:18.315
and Carlie is not having it.

04:18.333 --> 04:21.485
DOUG: You told me to take time
to find myself!

04:21.503 --> 04:23.169
CARLIE:
To work on your novel,

04:23.264 --> 04:24.930
not waste your time
with<i> Call of Duty!</i>

04:25.081 --> 04:26.156
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

04:26.249 --> 04:28.158
How is<i> Call of Duty</i>
a waste of time?

04:28.251 --> 04:29.250
-Shush!
-Come on, baby.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.177
We haven't been together
all week.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.346
Let's get naked
or go get our fondue on.

04:33.499 --> 04:35.665
Hell, naked fondue sounds fun,
too.

04:35.684 --> 04:38.001
In a minute, let me just see
what happens next.

04:38.020 --> 04:39.519
"In a minute" for sex or fondue?

04:39.671 --> 04:41.671
I need to know
what I'm getting excited about!

04:42.524 --> 04:44.950
CARLIE:
That's great,
pour yourself another drink.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.510
That'll solve things!

04:46.528 --> 04:48.011
DOUG:
Maybe you should have one
and loosen up.

04:48.180 --> 04:49.696
-CARLIE: I can't.
-DOUG: Why not?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.290
-CARLIE: I'm pregnant!
-(both gasp)

04:51.517 --> 04:53.959
Damn! Is it his?

04:54.186 --> 04:55.777
I don't think so.

04:55.871 --> 04:59.047
Oh, Doug, you're in
a real pickleball now.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.168
This was
the perfect double date.

05:03.320 --> 05:06.530
I mean, good food,
good company, and Max paid.

05:06.548 --> 05:07.697
You kidding?

05:07.716 --> 05:09.308
It was the longest
three hours of my life,

05:09.535 --> 05:11.959
and I've been bra shopping
with my mother.

05:12.037 --> 05:13.370
For my mother.

05:13.388 --> 05:14.220
Really?

05:14.315 --> 05:15.480
I thought you were having fun.

05:15.632 --> 05:16.890
Plus, Max and Nicole
really clicked.

05:17.042 --> 05:18.317
(scoffs) Okay.

05:18.468 --> 05:20.877
Only thing that clicked was
her ill-fitting shoes.

05:20.896 --> 05:21.969
What was wrong with her shoes?

05:22.064 --> 05:23.396
Please. (scoffs)

05:23.490 --> 05:25.157
Her toes were
hanging off the front

05:25.308 --> 05:27.400
like lemmings
going over a cliff.

05:27.477 --> 05:29.143
Boo, next time,
you got to alternate.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.905
You know, margarita, water,
margarita, water.

05:32.666 --> 05:36.076
Don't get me wrong,
she is very attractive,

05:36.228 --> 05:37.502
from the ankles up.

05:37.654 --> 05:40.113
Are you still mad 'cause
she took the last pretzel bite?

05:40.174 --> 05:42.082
I'm just looking out for Max.

05:42.234 --> 05:43.491
And yes,
there were 12 pretzel bites.

05:43.585 --> 05:46.570
Standard appetizer protocol:
three for each of us.

05:46.588 --> 05:49.906
Well, for Max's sake,
I hope they go out again.

05:49.999 --> 05:52.333
(scoffs) Well,
if anyone knows Max, it's me.

05:52.427 --> 05:55.228
And lemming toes,
one and done.

05:58.842 --> 06:00.266
Hey, did I miss anything?

06:00.361 --> 06:02.009
Carlie bought
another pregnancy test,

06:02.029 --> 06:03.269
-but she hasn't taken it yet.
-Oh.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.422
Kung Pao chicken
and a lady peeing on a stick,

06:05.440 --> 06:07.257
I'm so glad we finally found
a show we both like.

06:07.275 --> 06:09.426
(chuckles)
Wait, you liked<i> Bridgerton.</i>

06:09.444 --> 06:12.445
Oh, yeah, that's right, I did.

06:13.523 --> 06:16.282
Carlie is still on the phone
with her mom.

06:16.435 --> 06:20.604
She has a condo in Lexington,
so she thinks she's all that.

06:20.697 --> 06:23.215
Hey, um, what is he doing here?

06:23.366 --> 06:25.609
Oh, I was telling him
all about my neighbors at work,

06:25.702 --> 06:27.460
and you know how happy
gossip makes him.

06:27.613 --> 06:30.389
And the<i> Housewives</i>
are on hiatus.

06:30.540 --> 06:31.948
Well, I thought tonight was
supposed to be you and me

06:31.950 --> 06:34.284
listening to the personal
problems of total strangers.

06:34.302 --> 06:35.969
I mean, it'll be weird
if Phil's here.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.230
He's as quiet as a church mouse.

06:38.381 --> 06:41.900
But if a squeal of delight
does sneak out,

06:42.051 --> 06:43.627
it's the Lord's fault.

06:43.645 --> 06:44.811
(knocking)

06:44.963 --> 06:46.963
Knock, knock, who's there?

06:46.982 --> 06:48.481
Prosecco!

06:48.575 --> 06:49.983
(squeals)

06:50.077 --> 06:51.993
Praise Jesus.

06:59.161 --> 07:00.477
Meanwhile, downtown,

07:00.495 --> 07:02.403
Kat went to Middle-see
her friend Max.

07:02.423 --> 07:05.072
Sometimes I like to pretend
I'm in<i> Sex and the City.</i>

07:05.092 --> 07:07.408
Hey, what's going on?

07:07.428 --> 07:08.576
It has been a day.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.928
Meowly Cyrus has worms,

07:10.005 --> 07:11.245
so it's been a lot of
sifting through litter boxes

07:11.265 --> 07:12.747
and inspecting cat butts.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.416
You know, you're allowed
to say "nothing much."

07:15.436 --> 07:17.844
(chuckles) Listen, um,
about last night,

07:17.938 --> 07:21.681
I don't know what Oscar was
thinking, but I am so sorry.

07:21.833 --> 07:22.666
About what?

07:22.684 --> 07:25.685
-Hey, Kat!
-Oh. Oh! Hey!

07:25.762 --> 07:27.261
Hey, it's Nicole!

07:27.281 --> 07:29.355
I didn't know she was here.
You didn't say that.

07:29.450 --> 07:32.175
Well, you were pretty busy
talking about wormy cat butts.

07:32.194 --> 07:35.345
(laughs) Oh, my gosh,
ooh, look at your shoes.

07:35.347 --> 07:37.622
-I just got 'em.
What do you think?
-So cute.

07:37.849 --> 07:40.459
Does this woman not know
what size shoe she wears?

07:40.627 --> 07:43.277
You know, there's a lot of
stuff written about you

07:43.371 --> 07:45.021
on the ladies' room wall.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.631
Really? Well,
I hope it's as nice

07:46.858 --> 07:49.259
as the stuff written about me
in the men's room.

07:50.195 --> 07:52.195
It was until what I just wrote.

07:52.288 --> 07:54.121
-Oh.
-Oh! (laughs)

07:54.141 --> 07:55.548
Funny<i> and</i> pretty.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.702
Get a gander of these shoes.
She's the whole package.

07:58.795 --> 07:59.627
(Max chuckles)

07:59.721 --> 08:01.295
Oh, hey,
Seth's taking his break.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.315
Get up there
and show me what you got.

08:03.466 --> 08:04.557
Oh, come on, I don't want to...

08:04.710 --> 08:06.300
You're the one

08:06.394 --> 08:07.468
what a great piano player
you are.

08:07.488 --> 08:10.655
Okay, I have
never said that once.

08:10.807 --> 08:12.157
Oh, my God.

08:12.308 --> 08:14.217
You can't play the piano,
can you?

08:14.236 --> 08:15.643
It's all a lie.

Max!

seven months and two weeks.

08:23.337 --> 08:26.246
If I knew the days,
that would be creepy.

08:26.340 --> 08:29.257
I would love to hear you play,
too, Nicole.

08:30.085 --> 08:31.417
All right.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.160
But when I ask if everybody's
having a good time,

08:33.255 --> 08:36.181
I better hear
some enthusiastic "hell yeahs."

08:37.000 --> 08:38.350
-Isn't she great?
-Yeah.

08:38.501 --> 08:41.394
But, you know,
can she really play that thing?

08:51.439 --> 08:53.923

I'm gonna need a partner.

Why are you going all psycho
raccoon on those muffins?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.690
I'm stressed,
I'm looking for the chocolate,

10:17.784 --> 10:19.359
I need the chocolate.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.268
And why are you so stingy
with the chips?

10:21.288 --> 10:23.437
I put in a handful per muffin.

Next time go for two.

Well, they may be tiny,

No, it's Nicole.

10:47.463 --> 10:48.888
Oh, I thought he liked her.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.556
He does, but he's stupid.

10:50.709 --> 10:52.725
He doesn't know
she's all wrong for him.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.377
How so?

10:54.396 --> 10:55.545

10:55.563 --> 10:57.322
like, pretty and nice
and kind and funny

10:57.473 --> 10:59.883
and talented and generous,
but then you look at her shoes.

11:00.568 --> 11:02.385
Okay,
unless those shoes were made

11:02.404 --> 11:04.737
from the skin of newborn babies,
I'm not following.

11:04.890 --> 11:06.239
I-I can't explain it.

11:06.391 --> 11:07.982

better than anyone,

-Fine. All right.
-Randi, I'm not.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.010
-So drop it.
-It's been dropped.

11:19.162 --> 11:20.086
I'm just saying...

11:20.180 --> 11:22.013
Oh, look who picked it up.

Look at this,

11:27.336 --> 11:29.245
in bed with another woman
and a gay man.

11:29.264 --> 11:32.749
It's the '70s all over again.

11:48.433 --> 11:49.523
DOUG:
What are you doing?

11:49.543 --> 11:51.117
-CARLIE: Packing.
-DOUG: For where?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.769
-CARLIE: My mother's.
-DOUG: Oh, please.

11:52.862 --> 11:54.270
You're going to Brad's.

11:54.363 --> 11:56.105

Fine, I'm going to Brad's,

-CARLIE: Just leave me alone!

12:01.796 --> 12:04.205
She should go to Brad's.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.282
At least he's giving me
a grandchild.

12:07.210 --> 12:09.452
Maybe I'm a little
overinvested in this.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.880
Are we sure that
the baby is Brad's?

12:12.899 --> 12:14.381
Of course it is.

12:14.476 --> 12:16.884
It happened the weekend
Doug went to Nashville.

12:16.978 --> 12:18.361
Follow the damn show.

12:19.965 --> 12:21.147
Oh, hey.

12:21.299 --> 12:23.074
Ah, the gang's all here.

12:23.151 --> 12:25.318
And Phil is sitting
on my pillow.

12:25.470 --> 12:26.411
Great.

12:26.562 --> 12:29.806
Don't worry,
I toot lilac and lavender.

12:29.899 --> 12:31.140
(chuckles) Check it out.

12:31.159 --> 12:33.400
Carlie's moving out
to go live with Dr. Brad.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.419
Oh, cool, cool.

12:34.570 --> 12:35.736
Uh, can I talk to you
for a second?

12:35.830 --> 12:37.313
Oh, yeah, sure. Ooh.

12:37.406 --> 12:38.481
Make sure you guys come get me
if Doug starts crying.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.550
Y'all know I love it
when Doug cries.

12:42.170 --> 12:43.928
I think I saw Doug
in the elevator.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.580
Spill that tea, girl.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.725
One word: Crocs.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.010
Say no more.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.012
What are they doing here again?

12:53.106 --> 12:55.014
Well, I invited them again.
Is that a problem?

12:55.108 --> 12:56.182
Look at me.

12:56.334 --> 12:57.834
I've folded my arms.

12:57.927 --> 12:59.185
Yes, it's a problem.

12:59.262 --> 13:02.447
Well, you had fun with them
last night.

13:03.174 --> 13:04.282
Didn't you?

13:04.433 --> 13:06.859
Doesn't mean I want them here
every night.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.345
This is supposed to be our time.

13:09.364 --> 13:12.031
Well, last week when it was
supposed to be "our time,"

13:12.183 --> 13:13.958
you and Max went
to Chuck E. Cheese.

13:14.185 --> 13:16.110
But you said you were could
with that,

13:16.204 --> 13:18.779
-and it was Dave & Buster's.
-Same thing.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.039
They are not the same thing.

13:20.191 --> 13:21.649
You can't get drunk
at Chuck E. Cheese.

13:21.651 --> 13:23.026
Believe me, I tried.

13:23.194 --> 13:25.452
RANDI:
Point is, I don't sit around
waiting for you

13:25.472 --> 13:27.380
to decide when it's "our time."

13:27.532 --> 13:29.123
CARTER:
Well, by my calculations,

13:29.259 --> 13:30.883
"our time" hasn't happened
in over a week.

13:31.036 --> 13:34.720
RANDI:
Oh, sorry, I'll try to find you,
what, two minutes?

13:34.815 --> 13:37.131
-DOUG (crying): Carlie, please.
-CARTER: That was one time...

13:37.150 --> 13:38.724
DOUG: What does Brad
give you that I don't?

13:38.893 --> 13:40.634
Oh, don't you hate it

13:40.654 --> 13:43.470
when two of your favorite shows
are on at the same time?

13:43.565 --> 13:46.574
(overlapping arguing)

13:54.059 --> 13:55.667
-Hey, Kat.
-Oh!

13:55.818 --> 13:57.669
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

13:57.820 --> 14:00.338
Yep, yep, just, uh...
Yeah, just a little dizzy,

14:00.489 --> 14:02.507
but, ooh, I kind of like that.
(chuckles)

14:02.584 --> 14:04.400
Are you here to see Max?
Well, that's a stupid question.

14:04.493 --> 14:05.510
Although you could be here
to see me, like,

14:05.661 --> 14:06.678
I'm not nobody.
Whoa, maybe I hit my head

14:06.905 --> 14:07.995
harder than I thought.

14:08.831 --> 14:11.257
Yeah, I'm-I'm here
to see Max again.

14:11.409 --> 14:13.000
Hope I'm not coming on
too strong.

14:13.094 --> 14:14.001
You don't think I am, do you?

14:14.095 --> 14:15.761
No, no, not at all.

14:15.856 --> 14:16.913
Good.

14:17.006 --> 14:18.172
'Cause I really like him.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.024
(chuckles):
Oh, good. Good for you.

14:20.176 --> 14:21.508
Good for him.
Good for both of you.

14:21.603 --> 14:25.012
Good for everybody.
Really just plain good!

14:25.031 --> 14:26.347
Still dizzy?

14:26.366 --> 14:29.016
Nope, just a lot of words
and only one mouth.

14:29.110 --> 14:30.351
-You want to join us?
-Oh, no.

14:30.445 --> 14:32.428
I'm-I'm sure you two
want to be alone.

14:32.521 --> 14:34.163
-Well, actually...
-Okay, I'll join.

14:35.691 --> 14:38.877

with three dipping sauces:

14:39.028 --> 14:40.361
Cheez Whiz, ranch,

14:40.380 --> 14:43.548
and what is either
barbeque sauce or old ketchup.

14:43.775 --> 14:44.883
Bon appétit.

14:45.034 --> 14:46.867
Do you have mustard?

14:46.961 --> 14:48.202
Get out.

14:48.296 --> 14:50.371
-(laughs)
-Oh, oh, your first fight.

14:50.448 --> 14:53.207
Remember, no name calling,
use "I" statements only.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.708
Well, I think you're crazy.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.286
I want you to try one.

14:57.380 --> 14:58.563
(groans)

15:01.234 --> 15:02.975
(laughs)

15:03.069 --> 15:05.403
I was right,
this is super gross.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.888
(laughs) You guys are so cute.

15:07.982 --> 15:09.465
I want to drill holes
in the top of your heads

15:09.484 --> 15:11.725
and turn you into
salt and pepper shakers.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.060
Wow.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.654
-That's a specific compliment.
-(chuckles)

15:14.748 --> 15:16.897
So, when are you gonna take
this lovely young lady

15:16.991 --> 15:18.249
out on a real date?

15:18.401 --> 15:20.643
Said no jealous woman ever.

15:20.662 --> 15:22.645
Yeah, Kingbird,
when are you gonna take me out?

15:22.738 --> 15:26.674
Really? You want more than tots
and a trio of dubious sauces?

15:27.928 --> 15:29.485
Fine, I'm off next Tuesday.

15:29.504 --> 15:31.412
Ooh, the infamous
night of the taco.

15:31.506 --> 15:34.081

15:34.100 --> 15:36.250
-(groans) Better now.
-Oh!

15:36.327 --> 15:38.327
Wah-bam! Tuesday it is.

15:38.421 --> 15:40.104
Where are you gonna take her?

15:40.256 --> 15:42.498
Well, I was thinking maybe...

15:42.591 --> 15:43.608
That won't work.

15:43.835 --> 15:45.259
Start with a cocktail
at The Brown Hotel.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.945
Classic Louisville at its best.

15:47.096 --> 15:49.172
Then dinner at Scarlucci's
followed by a moonlit stroll

15:49.265 --> 15:50.615
along the waterfront,

15:50.766 --> 15:54.118
and then-- Oh! What?
What's that? Fireworks.

15:54.270 --> 15:56.512
Perfect for a romantic kiss.

15:56.531 --> 15:59.031
Passers-by applaud,
their faith in love restored

15:59.184 --> 16:00.625
thanks to you.

16:00.776 --> 16:03.753
Call me Kat?
Call me Cupid.

16:06.524 --> 16:08.282
Why are you getting
so worked up?

16:08.301 --> 16:09.801
It's one stupid night.

16:10.028 --> 16:11.302
How are you not getting this?

16:11.529 --> 16:13.972
I want to spend time with you,
alone.

16:14.199 --> 16:16.015
I miss you.

16:17.035 --> 16:18.142
Aw.

16:18.294 --> 16:20.144
Well, why didn't you
just say that

16:20.296 --> 16:22.205
instead of all
that other dumb stuff?

16:22.207 --> 16:23.815
Sometimes I got to talk
for a while

16:23.966 --> 16:25.608
before I know what I'm saying.

16:26.544 --> 16:28.319
Well, you're right.

16:28.546 --> 16:31.322
Our time is special
and we never get enough of it.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.807
There's nothing hotter
than when you say I'm right.

16:33.901 --> 16:35.284
(chuckles)

16:37.980 --> 16:39.330
I don't hear anything.

16:39.557 --> 16:41.574
The only thing I hear is
your damn nose.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.984
It's whistling like a teapot.

16:44.078 --> 16:46.078
It was the cheese.

16:46.231 --> 16:48.548
Brie makes me mucusy.

16:49.734 --> 16:51.676
Let's get closer.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.255
CARTER:
How about this? Is this right?

16:56.407 --> 16:58.241
-RANDI: Well, it's not wrong.
-Oh, dear.

16:58.334 --> 16:59.575
What?

16:59.594 --> 17:01.168
Oh, my.

17:01.187 --> 17:04.355
We should not be watching this.

17:04.507 --> 17:06.733
-CARTER: Yeah!
-And yet here we are.

17:12.181 --> 17:13.439
You could help, you know.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.350
I'm not pointing out all
the things you're doing wrong.

17:16.519 --> 17:17.518
That's kind of helping.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.370
There's a wrong way
to put up chairs?

17:19.597 --> 17:23.332
I didn't think there was,
but look at this nightmare.

17:24.527 --> 17:26.544
By the way, um,

17:26.695 --> 17:27.770
Nicole's great.

17:27.863 --> 17:30.048
(sighs) Right?

17:30.199 --> 17:31.865
It's like we have
this connection

17:32.034 --> 17:33.292
on so many different levels.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.887
I was beginning to think
I would never find that.

17:36.038 --> 17:37.371
Well, it was just
a matter of time.

17:37.465 --> 17:39.448
(chuckles) Oh,
I completely forgot.

17:39.467 --> 17:40.966
Nicole said
she would love to teach you

17:41.061 --> 17:41.967
how to do a cartwheel.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.210
Oh, I taught myself.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.303
I found a YouTube video.
Check it out.

17:44.455 --> 17:45.712
-Kat, no.
-No, no, no. I got this.

17:45.732 --> 17:46.713
Arms up.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.608
Lunge, kick...

17:49.644 --> 17:51.069
-Oh...
-(groaning)

17:51.220 --> 17:53.738
Okay. That's... how it's done.

17:53.889 --> 17:55.648
I think I should probably get
out of here.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.575
(laughter)

17:58.244 --> 18:00.653
Hey, Kat. Thanks again.

18:00.805 --> 18:01.895
For what?

18:01.989 --> 18:03.823
For setting me up with Nicole.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.324
Oh, well...

18:05.418 --> 18:07.810
I just want you to be happy.

18:07.829 --> 18:09.194
You're my person.

18:09.347 --> 18:11.714
You're my person, too.

18:13.209 --> 18:14.717
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Yeah.

18:22.343 --> 18:24.977
Oh, hey,
did you forget something?

18:40.269 --> 18:42.603
I can't believe Randi and Carter
kicked us out.

18:42.680 --> 18:45.456
Well, we were watching them
have sex.

18:45.533 --> 18:49.109
No, we were watching them
about to have sex.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.278
He couldn't even get
her bra off.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.113
Well, it did not help

18:53.133 --> 18:56.025
that you started
shouting instructions.

18:56.118 --> 18:57.451
It was killing me.

18:57.470 --> 19:01.055
He was pawing at her like
a bear with a picnic basket.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.368
Oh, hey,
what are you two doing here?

19:05.386 --> 19:07.812
We had one hell of a night.

19:08.039 --> 19:10.389
We heard things,
we saw things.

19:10.541 --> 19:12.191
So many things.

19:13.227 --> 19:15.211
And I learned
how to take a bra off.

19:15.229 --> 19:18.639
Do you know that some clasp
in the front?

19:18.658 --> 19:21.159
Um, that sounds fun. Good night.

19:21.310 --> 19:22.551
You okay, sweetheart?

19:22.553 --> 19:23.977
Yeah. Yeah,
of course I'm okay.

19:24.071 --> 19:25.312
I mean, why wouldn't I be okay?

19:25.331 --> 19:26.647
Can't I come in
from having drinks

19:26.666 --> 19:28.073
with my best friend
without being asked

19:28.226 --> 19:29.074
a million questions?

19:29.227 --> 19:30.334
You're acting weird.

19:30.561 --> 19:32.653
I'm always acting weird,
it's my thing.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.422
(squawks)

19:36.567 --> 19:38.533
Yeah,
it's always been her thing.
