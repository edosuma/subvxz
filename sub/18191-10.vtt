WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.636
PREVIOUSLY
ON "CHASING LIFE..."

00:02.669 --> 00:04.371
- WHAT THE HELL?
- YOU HAVE GREER.

00:04.405 --> 00:05.673
SHE'S YOUR LOVER
AND YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND

00:05.706 --> 00:07.307
ALL ROLLED INTO ONE.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.409
April:
DANNY...

00:08.442 --> 00:09.776
I'M ON A DEADLINE.

00:10.009 --> 00:11.512
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER

00:11.544 --> 00:14.448
THE LAST TIME I DID SOMETHING
THAT DUMB AND IMPULSIVE.

00:14.481 --> 00:16.149
PLEASE HAVE THE SURGERY.

00:16.182 --> 00:18.285
I MADE THIS DECISION
LONG BEFORE YOU.

00:18.318 --> 00:20.187
HONESTLY, I DON'T NEED
YOU IN MY LIFE

00:20.221 --> 00:22.189
IF YOU'RE ON A MISSION
TO MAKE ME RETHINK THAT.

00:22.222 --> 00:24.057
I'M ABOUT TO GO
FIGHT FOR MY LIFE.

00:24.091 --> 00:26.527
I CAN'T BE AROUND SOMEONE
WHO HAS THE CHANCE TO DO THAT

00:26.559 --> 00:28.129
AND WON'T EVEN TRY.

00:28.161 --> 00:29.730
GOODBYE, LEO.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.431
HAVE A NICE LIFE.

00:32.665 --> 00:36.603
April:
OH GOD, THIS WEATHER
IS LIKE PERFECT.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.338
DO YOU HEAR
THOSE BIRDS?

00:38.371 --> 00:40.039
THEY'RE FREAKING OUT.

00:40.073 --> 00:41.609
WELL YEAH,
'CAUSE THEY'RE
DOING IT.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.344
( laughing )

00:43.377 --> 00:45.345
EW.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.581
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS THE LAST TIME

00:47.615 --> 00:50.216
I'M GONNA BE
OUTSIDE FOR A MONTH.

00:53.186 --> 00:54.554
Brenna:
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND

00:54.588 --> 00:56.823
WHY YOU HAVE TO BE
IN HERE FOR SO LONG.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.792
ISN'T CHEMO
ONLY SEVEN DAYS?

00:58.826 --> 01:01.395
THAT'S JUST HOW IT WORKS
WITH LEUKEMIA.

01:01.429 --> 01:04.465
EVERY OTHER KIND
OF CANCER YOU CAN
RECOVER AT HOME.

01:04.498 --> 01:07.834
I WISH YOU HAD
LYMPHOMA INSTEAD.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.236
( chuckles )
RIGHT?

01:09.269 --> 01:11.471
OR AT LEAST LIKE...
GALLBLADDER CANCER.

01:11.504 --> 01:12.506
HMM.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.108
RECTAL WOULD BE NICE.

01:15.141 --> 01:16.576
Sara:
SWEETHEART?

01:16.609 --> 01:18.311
DO YOU THINK THEY
HEARD ME SAY RECTAL?

01:18.344 --> 01:19.612
Sara:
I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT

01:19.646 --> 01:22.415
YOUR CONVERSATION,
BUT IT'S TIME
TO GO IN.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.856

I'M APRIL,

02:59.680 --> 03:00.881
LAILANI.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.181
THAT'S PRETTY.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.352
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I'M GONNA EAT.

03:05.385 --> 03:07.187
- DO YOU FEEL SICK?
- NOT YET.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.188
YOU WILL,
IT'S ONLY DAY ONE.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.258
BY TOMORROW YOU'LL BE
FEELING MORE FATIGUE,

03:11.292 --> 03:12.926
MAYBE SOME SWELLING,
POSSIBLY NAUSEA.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.328
AND THE STEROIDS
WE HAVE YOU ON

03:14.360 --> 03:15.663
CAUSE SOME PATIENTS
TO HALLUCINATE.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.231
OOH, JEALOUS.

03:18.264 --> 03:20.366
NOTHING TO BE JEALOUS ABOUT.
TRUST ME.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.235
I WAS KIDDING.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.872
NEVER MIND.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.215
YOU GUYS DIDN'T HAVE
TO DO ALL THIS.

03:35.248 --> 03:36.783
Beth:
PLEASE, THERE WAS
NO WAY I WAS GOING

03:36.817 --> 03:38.551
TO LET YOU STAY IN A ROOM
WITHOUT FLOWERS.

03:38.586 --> 03:39.819
AND THERE'S NO WAY
I WAS GOING TO LET YOU

03:39.853 --> 03:42.756
STAY IN A ROOM
WITHOUT CANDY CRUSH.

03:42.789 --> 03:44.457
Man:
I WOULDN'T PLAY THOSE.

03:44.490 --> 03:45.859
YOU'RE ASKING
FOR A BIG OLD MIGRAINE

03:45.893 --> 03:47.328
ONCE THE CHEMO KICKS IN.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.962
AND YOU ARE?

03:48.996 --> 03:50.531
I'M SOL.
I'M RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

03:50.563 --> 03:51.731
OH, GREAT.

03:51.764 --> 03:54.634
THEN IT'LL ONLY BE
A SHORT WALK BACK THERE.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.972
WOW, THIS IS
A TOUGH ROOM.

03:58.004 --> 03:59.772
YEAH WELL,
IT IS A HOSPITAL ROOM.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.610
( muttering to himself )

04:02.643 --> 04:04.677
WELL WELL WELL,
THE GANG'S ALL HERE.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.312
HEY, DR. HAMBURG.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.948
SO I SEE YOU'RE
ABOUT TO EXPERIENCE

04:07.981 --> 04:09.415
THE JOYS OF HOSPITAL FOOD.

04:09.449 --> 04:10.818
( sighs )
I CAN'T WAIT.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.752
- SO HOW'S YOUR APPETITE?
- ARE YOU HUNGRY?

04:12.786 --> 04:14.989
UM, NOT REALLY.
BUT I'LL TRY AND EAT.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.290
I'M JUST KIND OF NERVOUS,

04:17.324 --> 04:19.326
WAITING FOR EVERYTHING
TO KICK IN.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.894
EVERY PATIENT
IS DIFFERENT, SO TRY NOT
TO ANTICIPATE TOO MUCH.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.564
LIKE GEORGE SAID,
EVERY PATIENT RESPONDS
DIFFERENTLY.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.533
- SO IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS--
- YOU CAN CALL ME ANY TIME

04:26.567 --> 04:28.302
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
AT ALL, OKAY?

04:28.334 --> 04:30.403
WELL, I GOT BETTER GRADES
THAN HIM IN MED SCHOOL,

04:30.437 --> 04:31.904
- SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK ME.
- ( polite laughter )

04:33.740 --> 04:36.310
SO, GEORGE...

04:36.343 --> 04:38.379
AT SOME POINT YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO LET ME

04:38.411 --> 04:40.279
DO MY JOB
AND YOU CAN DO YOURS.

04:40.314 --> 04:41.581
WELL, WHAT'S MY JOB?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.483
BE HER UNCLE.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.622
( school bell rings )

04:50.024 --> 04:51.457
I JUST WALKED BEHIND
THE COUNTER

04:51.492 --> 04:52.860
AND STARTED FLIPPING BURGERS.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.028
NO ONE EVEN NOTICED
I DIDN'T WORK THERE

04:55.062 --> 04:56.529
FOR LIKE
HALF AN HOUR.

04:56.562 --> 04:57.865
SO COOL.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.432
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.401
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.802
HEY, CAN YOU
GIVE US A SECOND?

05:02.836 --> 05:04.771
THANKS.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.341
OKAY, SO WHENEVER YOU
WANT TO HANG OUT

05:07.374 --> 05:09.009
I HAVE TO DROP
ALL MY OTHER FRIENDS.

05:09.043 --> 05:10.411
HEY, DOUBLE STANDARD.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.845
ARE YOU EVEN FRIENDS
WITH THAT GIRL?

05:11.879 --> 05:13.413
I'VE NEVER SEEN
HER BEFORE.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.749
YEAH WELL, YOU'VE BEEN
KIND OF DISTRACTED LATELY.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.817
HOW ARE YOU ATTACKING
ME RIGHT NOW?

05:17.850 --> 05:20.487
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MADE OUT
WITH KIERAN IN MY ROOM.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.021
YOU WEREN'T EVEN
INTO HIM.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.856
YOU DITCHED HIM
FOR SOME SHALLOW RICH GIRL.

05:23.891 --> 05:24.891
LET'S SAY I CAN RELATE.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.759
GREER IS NOT SHALLOW.

05:26.793 --> 05:29.629
YOU'RE RIGHT, I FORGOT.
SHE'S IN ECO CLUB.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.466
ARE YOU LISTENING
TO YOURSELF?

05:32.499 --> 05:35.069
YOU'RE ALWAYS SITTING AROUND
BAGGING ON RICH PEOPLE,

05:35.101 --> 05:37.071
TALKING ABOUT HOW
CLOSED-MINDED THEY ARE.

05:37.103 --> 05:38.639
BUT YOU'RE
THE CLOSED-MINDED ONE.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.475
JUST BECAUSE GREER
DOESN'T HATE EVERYTHING,

05:41.507 --> 05:42.875
THAT MAKES HER SHALLOW?

05:42.909 --> 05:44.711
WELL, GUESS WHAT?
I DON'T EITHER.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.747
THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT
THINGS IN LIFE

05:46.779 --> 05:49.516
THAN MAKING FUN
OF EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME.

05:49.550 --> 05:53.019
WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT,
MAYBE WE COULD BE FRIENDS AGAIN.

05:53.052 --> 05:56.055
( scoffs )
WELL, THANKS FOR
THE LIFE LESSON.

05:56.090 --> 05:57.824
HAVE FUN PUTTING
RIBBONS IN YOUR HAIR

05:57.858 --> 05:59.058
AND LISTENING
TO TOP 40.

05:59.093 --> 06:01.694
I'LL BE OVER HERE
NOT SELLING OUT.

06:01.728 --> 06:05.365
- ( school bell rings )
- ( huffs )

06:29.757 --> 06:31.824
NICE P.J.s, MOM.

06:31.858 --> 06:33.159
THANK YOU.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.694
I JUST BOUGHT THEM.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.096
I WANTED TO LOOK
PRESENTABLE.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.930
I'M NOT USED
TO SLEEPING IN PUBLIC.

06:37.965 --> 06:41.000
- YEAH... ME NEITHER.
- ( door opens )

06:41.033 --> 06:43.771
DID I HEAR WE HAVE
A MAMA IN THE HOUSE?

06:43.803 --> 06:45.605
YES.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.141
- I'M MARTINE.
- I'M SARA.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.076
( whispers )
MARTINE'S MY FAVORITE NURSE.

06:49.108 --> 06:50.978
AH, YOU SAY THAT
TO ALL THE NURSES.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.913
I DEFINITELY DO NOT
SAY THAT TO LAILANI.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.848
JUST CHECKING IN
BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP.

06:55.882 --> 06:57.985
OH, AND DON'T PANIC
IF YOU HEAR AN ALARM

06:58.018 --> 06:59.185
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT.

06:59.418 --> 07:01.187
WE HAVE YOUR BED
SET TO ALERT US
IF YOU GET UP.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.122
EVERY TIME I GET UP?

07:03.156 --> 07:05.858
YES, AND SOMETIMES
WHEN YOU DON'T.

07:05.892 --> 07:08.127
THAT ALARM
HAS A TENDENCY
TO MALFUNCTION.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.697
I PRESSED MY CALL BUTTON
10 MINUTES AGO.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.500
SOL, YOU PRESSED IT
LESS THAN ONE MINUTE AGO.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.935
- WELL, IT FELT LIKE 10.
- ( Martine groans )

07:15.968 --> 07:18.137
IF I'M NOT OUT
OF THERE IN 15,

07:18.172 --> 07:20.173
PLEASE PRESS
YOUR CALL BUTTON.

07:24.845 --> 07:27.447
( sighs )
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA BE
ABLE TO FALL ASLEEP IN HERE.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.483
I THOUGHT
THAT MIGHT HAPPEN.

07:29.516 --> 07:31.685
AND I CAME PREPARED.

07:33.821 --> 07:34.822
( unzips )

07:38.192 --> 07:41.228
OH MY GOD.
WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS?

07:41.461 --> 07:42.795
IN THE ATTIC.

07:42.829 --> 07:45.098
REMEMBER, DAD TAUGHT YOU
HOW TO READ WITH THAT BOOK.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.634
AND WE WOULD READ IT
TO YOU WHEN YOU
COULDN'T SLEEP.

07:47.668 --> 07:50.903
IT'S NOT THAT
I COULDN'T SLEEP,
I JUST HATED SLEEPING.

07:50.937 --> 07:53.139
YOU USED TO WAKE UP
EVERY MORNING CRYING

07:53.173 --> 07:54.975
BECAUSE YOU WERE JUST SURE
THAT ALL THE GROWN-UPS

07:55.007 --> 07:57.144
WERE UP ALL NIGHT,
HAVING FUN WITHOUT YOU.

07:57.177 --> 08:00.680
WOW, I WAS PRETTY INSECURE.

08:00.713 --> 08:03.716
( laughs )
NO, YOU JUST DIDN'T
WANT TO MISS ANYTHING.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.656
ALL RIGHT.

08:09.689 --> 08:11.891
"FROG AND TOAD TOGETHER."

SO LONG TO GET YOUR MESSAGE.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.909
WE WERE IN ROMANIA
AND I GOT MUGGED

09:36.943 --> 09:38.979
AND IT TOOK ME FOREVER
TO GET A NEW PHONE.

09:39.011 --> 09:41.315

KNOWS I HAVE CANCER TOO?

09:43.582 --> 09:44.884
I'M SORRY THAT I
HAVEN'T BEEN IN TOUCH

09:44.918 --> 09:47.086
THESE LAST COUPLE
OF WEEKS WHILE I'VE
BEEN TRAVELING.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.755
HOW DID ALL OF THIS HAPPEN?

09:51.258 --> 09:54.327
UM... IT'S KIND OF
A LONG STORY.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.364
I REMEMBER YOU WEREN'T
FEELING WELL BEFORE I LEFT.

09:57.596 --> 09:59.899
LIKE THAT NIGHT YOU THOUGHT
YOU HAD FOOD POISONING.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.634
DO YOU THINK THAT WAS
ALL BECAUSE OF THIS?

10:01.668 --> 10:05.339
UM... MAYBE.
I DON'T KNOW.

10:05.371 --> 10:09.710
WELL, HERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.679
IT'S A PLAYLIST.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.849
I PUT IT ON A DRIVE
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY LONG.

10:15.881 --> 10:17.149
HOW LONG?

10:17.183 --> 10:19.919
10,080 MINUTES.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.054
THAT'S HOW MANY MINUTES
ARE IN SEVEN DAYS

10:22.088 --> 10:24.357
AND CHEMO IS SEVEN DAYS.
RIGHT?

10:26.793 --> 10:29.296
DOMINIC, THIS IS...

10:31.030 --> 10:32.765
( sighs )
I HAVE TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.634
YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

10:36.036 --> 10:39.806
I ACTUALLY FOUND OUT
I WAS SICK AWHILE AGO.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.640
WELL, WHEN?

10:43.643 --> 10:46.013
THE NIGHT OF OUR FIRST DATE.

10:47.913 --> 10:50.384
I JUST DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
TO TELL YOU.

10:50.417 --> 10:54.821
AND I KNOW--
I'D HAD THIS CRUSH ON YOU

10:54.855 --> 10:57.657
FOR SO LONG AND IT WAS
FINALLY HAPPENING.

10:57.691 --> 11:00.192
I JUST WASN'T READY TO HAVE
THAT ALL FALL APART.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.764
SO THE WHOLE TIME
WE WERE DATING?

11:04.798 --> 11:06.133
WELL, IT WASN'T
JUST YOU.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.000
I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY
EXCEPT FOR BETH

11:08.034 --> 11:09.168
FOR A WHILE.

11:09.201 --> 11:11.138
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.273
DID YOU NOT TRUST ME
OR SOMETHING?

11:13.306 --> 11:16.009
OR... DID YOU THINK
I WOULD LEAVE YOU?

11:16.043 --> 11:20.013
WELL, I MEAN...
KINDA.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.215
YOU WERE ALWAYS TALKING
ABOUT HOW YOU HATED

11:22.249 --> 11:23.716
GIRLS WITH DRAMA.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.851
AND THE NIGHT YOU FOUND OUT
LEO HENDRIE WAS SICK,

11:25.885 --> 11:27.788
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T KNOW
IF YOU COULD DEAL WITH THAT.

11:27.821 --> 11:30.090
- SO I--
- YOU MEAN THE NIGHT
LEO SCREWED YOU OVER.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.924
I WAS JUST--
I WAS MAD AT THE GUY

11:31.957 --> 11:33.159
FOR WHAT HE DID TO YOU.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.898
NONE OF THAT MEANS
THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN THERE FOR YOU.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.133
I'M SORRY.

11:40.167 --> 11:44.004
I HANDLED THIS
ALL WRONG, I KNOW.

11:46.239 --> 11:49.076
I SHOULD RUN HOME
AND DROP OFF MY STUFF.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.077
I CAME STRAIGHT
FROM THE AIRPORT.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.946
HOW LONG ARE YOU
STAYING IN TOWN?

11:52.979 --> 11:55.381
STILL FIGURING
THAT OUT.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.921
( alarm beeps )

12:00.953 --> 12:03.722
( chuckles )
TIME'S UP.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.870
BRENNA CARVER.
MS. GREGORIAN WANTS
TO SEE YOU.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.106
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

12:20.139 --> 12:21.508
COME WITH ME.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.313
Ms. Gregorian:
I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE

12:27.346 --> 12:28.914
YOU GIRLS SKIPPED
THE ECO CLUB CONFERENCE

12:28.948 --> 12:31.051
DURING ADVENTURE WEEK
AND WENT OFF

12:31.083 --> 12:32.485
ON YOUR OWN ADVENTURE.

12:32.519 --> 12:33.953
I TOLD HER WE DIDN'T,

12:33.986 --> 12:35.121
WE JUST GOT FOOD POISONING--

12:35.154 --> 12:36.188
GREER, WHY DON'T
YOU LET BRENNA

12:36.222 --> 12:38.959
ANSWER FOR HERSELF, HM?

12:38.991 --> 12:41.128
SO YOU GOT
FOOD POISONING?

12:43.230 --> 12:46.466
GREER AND I BOTH HAD
BACON FOR BREAKFAST
THAT MORNING.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.769
AND I GUESS IT WAS
LIKE BAD OR SOMETHING.

12:49.802 --> 12:51.104
WE BOTH STARTED
TO FEEL SICK

12:51.138 --> 12:52.806
RIGHT BEFORE
MR. OSTROWSKY'S SPEECH.

12:52.838 --> 12:55.341
AND WE WENT TO LIE DOWN
IN A CONFERENCE ROOM.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.475
WE BOTH FELL ASLEEP.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.812
BY THE TIME WE WOKE UP,
EVERYONE LEFT

12:59.846 --> 13:01.947
TO GO TO THE NATURE PRESERVE.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.518
AND WE COULDN'T CALL ANYONE
BECAUSE OUR PHONE'S WERE DEAD.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.919
YOUR PHONES WERE DEAD?
GREER TOLD ME THAT YOU LOST

13:06.952 --> 13:08.922
YOUR PHONE AND THAT SHE
LEFT HERS IN THE ROOM.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.892
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I MEANT.

13:11.924 --> 13:12.993
MM-HMM.

13:13.025 --> 13:15.427
SO YOU DIDN'T
SNEAK OFF INTO A CAB

13:15.461 --> 13:16.863
TO GO DRINKING BY THE BEACH?

13:16.897 --> 13:18.999
AND YOU DIDN'T GET
A FRIEND TO SIGN YOU IN

13:19.032 --> 13:21.067
AND RECORD THE LECTURE?

13:21.100 --> 13:23.003
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT I WAS TOLD.

13:24.904 --> 13:25.905
NO.

13:27.039 --> 13:29.009
I NEED TO CALL
YOUR PARENTS, NOW.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.278
WAIT, PLEASE DON'T
CALL MY MOM.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.413
MY FAMILY'S GOING THROUGH
A REALLY HARD TIME RIGHT NOW.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.950
BRENNA, I'D ADVISE YOU
TO STOP LYING TO ME
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.018
SHE'S NOT LYING.

13:42.889 --> 13:45.424
MY SISTER'S
IN THE HOSPITAL.

13:45.457 --> 13:48.427
SHE HAS CANCER AND SHE
JUST STARTED CHEMO.

13:48.461 --> 13:52.599
WELL, I AM SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

13:52.831 --> 13:55.201
BUT THIS IS A SERIOUS OFFENSE
AND YOUR MOTHER NEEDS TO KNOW.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.369
I KNOW.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.304
BUT CAN I BE THE ONE
TO TELL HER?

13:58.337 --> 14:00.206
PLEASE?

14:01.341 --> 14:03.076
YOU HAVE UNTIL TOMORROW.

14:06.212 --> 14:08.014
( video game beeping )

14:12.885 --> 14:14.453
YOU WANNA PLAY CARDS?

14:14.486 --> 14:17.057
UM... NOT RIGHT NOW.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.457
HOW ABOUT LATER?

14:18.490 --> 14:20.059
MAYBE.

14:20.092 --> 14:22.261
( muttering )

14:24.630 --> 14:26.365
( knocks )

14:26.399 --> 14:29.101
SOL, I SAID I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN I WANNA PLAY CARDS.

14:31.538 --> 14:32.504
DANNY.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.106
HEY.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.980
YOU CAN SIT.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.548
NOT THAT ONE.

14:42.581 --> 14:44.216
THAT'S FOR DOCTORS ONLY.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.488
I'M MESSING WITH YOU.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.523
COME ON, I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE THE SLOW ONE HERE.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.568
OKAY, ARE YOU--
ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

15:02.601 --> 15:03.970
OR SOMETHING?

15:04.004 --> 15:06.206
BECAUSE YOU BARELY
ACKNOWLEDGED ME

15:06.239 --> 15:07.506
ON MY LAST DAY
AT WORK.

15:07.539 --> 15:10.110
DID I HURT YOUR FEELINGS
BY NOT TELLING YOU PERSONALLY

15:10.143 --> 15:12.611
- THAT I WAS SICK?
- NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.381
THEN WHY ARE YOU
ACTING SO WEIRD?

15:15.414 --> 15:17.650
( sighs )
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY THIS

15:17.683 --> 15:19.485
WITHOUT SOUNDING
LIKE I TOTALLY SUCK.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.054
OH MY GOD,
JUST TELL ME.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.590
OKAY.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.661
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE
AROUND YOU.

15:27.693 --> 15:29.528
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY,

15:29.562 --> 15:32.532
OR WHAT NOT TO SAY,

15:32.565 --> 15:34.634
OR HOW TO ACT
AROUND YOU.

15:34.668 --> 15:36.568
I MEAN, I CAN'T KEEP
BEING A JERK TO YOU.

15:36.602 --> 15:40.139
YES, YOU CAN.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.942
WHEN I WAS GOING TO WORK,
IT WAS LIKE MY ONLY BREAK

15:42.975 --> 15:45.278
FROM ALL THIS HEAVY STUFF.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.313
YOU KNOW,
OUR STUPID COMPETITIVENESS

15:47.346 --> 15:49.581
AND YOUR WHOLE
ARROGANT HARVARD THING?

15:50.683 --> 15:53.086
I NEEDED THAT TO STAY SANE.

15:55.054 --> 15:57.023
I STILL DO.

15:59.558 --> 16:02.428
IT'S NOT ARROGANCE.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.163
I'M JUST SMARTER
THAN YOU ARE.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.566
( laughs )

16:06.599 --> 16:10.135
♪ You and me got ourselves
a problem... ♪

16:10.169 --> 16:13.740
SERIOUSLY, THIS IS
THE MOST ROMANTIC
PRESENT EVER.

16:13.972 --> 16:15.708
YOU SHOULD WRITE
INTO LIKE "COSMO"
OR SOMETHING.

16:15.741 --> 16:16.743
I'M SURE THEY HAVE
A WHOLE COLUMN

16:16.975 --> 16:18.043
FOR STORIES LIKE THIS.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.346
THEY DO.
IT'S CALLED,

16:19.379 --> 16:21.748
"SWEETEST THINGS HE DID
RIGHT AFTER I CHEATED ON HIM."

16:21.980 --> 16:24.283
YOU DID NOT CHEAT
ON DOMINIC.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.985
YOU-- YOU GUYS
WERE ON A BREAK.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.653
AND YOU STILL
TECHNICALLY ARE.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.588
I MEAN, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF HE'S STAYING IN TOWN.

16:29.621 --> 16:32.292
YEAH, ESPECIALLY NOW
THAT HE KNOWS

16:32.325 --> 16:35.294
I WAS LYING TO HIM
FOR A MONTH.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.730
- HE'S HURT.
- WELL, HE'LL BE REALLY HURT

16:37.764 --> 16:39.999
IF YOU TELL HIM
YOU HOOKED UP
WITH LEO.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.000
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'D BE ABLE
TO GET BACK TOGETHER

16:42.034 --> 16:44.471
AFTER THAT--
ASSUMING THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.605
IT IS.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.408
I MEAN, WE ONLY BROKE UP
BECAUSE OF DISTANCE.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.476
AND BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
HIM TO FEEL OBLIGATED

16:50.509 --> 16:54.547
TO TAKE CARE OF ME
ONCE HE FOUND OUT.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.682
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY
NOT SCARED OFF.

16:56.716 --> 17:01.187
I MEAN, HE FLEW BACK HERE
FOR ME.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.222
- HE'S AMAZING.
- EXACTLY.

17:03.255 --> 17:05.525
SO JUST DON'T
ROCK THE BOAT, OKAY?

17:05.557 --> 17:07.227
LEO WAS A ONE-NIGHT STAND.

17:07.259 --> 17:09.596
WHAT HAPPENS
IN THE FUNERAL HOME
STAYS IN THE FUNERAL HOME.

17:09.628 --> 17:11.798
I FEEL LIKE
I'M GONNA PUKE.

17:12.030 --> 17:13.799
I KNOW, I KNOW.
YOU'RE THE MOST
MORAL PERSON I KNOW.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.469
- BUT IN THIS CASE
YOU JUST NEED TO--
- NO, BETH, I'M GONNA PUKE.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.405
UM...

17:21.207 --> 17:22.808
HERE, LET ME HELP YOU
TO THE BATHROOM.

17:26.445 --> 17:28.548
( alarm beeps )

17:31.683 --> 17:33.286
( softly )
HERE, HOLD ON TO ME.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.398
HEY, THERE YOU ARE.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.268
YOU READY FOR YOUR SLEEPOVER
WITH APRIL?

17:48.300 --> 17:49.269
YEAH.

17:49.301 --> 17:51.136
CAN I TALK
TO YOU FIRST?

17:51.171 --> 17:53.506
OH, AND WE NEED
TO TALK TO YOU TOO.

17:53.539 --> 17:55.575
SO YOU SHOULD SIT DOWN.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.112
THEY GOT THE RESULTS

17:59.144 --> 18:03.282
FROM THE CHEEK SWAB
AND YOU'RE NOT A MATCH

18:03.316 --> 18:05.351
FOR APRIL'S
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT.

18:05.384 --> 18:08.354
OH.

18:08.387 --> 18:09.689
IT DOESN'T MEAN
ANYTHING BAD

18:09.721 --> 18:11.156
IS GONNA HAPPEN
TO APRIL.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.558
NO, SO DON'T WORRY.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.693
'CAUSE THERE'S
A REALLY GOOD CHANCE
OF FINDING A MATCH

18:14.727 --> 18:16.429
OFF THE ANONYMOUS REGISTRY.

18:16.462 --> 18:17.797
AND THAT'S NOT
OUR ONLY CHOICE,

18:17.830 --> 18:19.665
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.106
SARA, I JUST WANNA...
( sighs )

18:28.141 --> 18:31.577
TELL YOU HOW SORRY I AM
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT--

18:31.611 --> 18:33.246
KISSING YOU.
I JUST--

18:33.278 --> 18:34.447
( chuckles )

18:34.480 --> 18:35.781
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.717
WELL, THAT'S JUST IT,
OBVIOUSLY I WASN'T THINKING.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.384
- IT'S OKAY.
- THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.554
I THINK WE WERE
JUST BOTH FEELING
A LITTLE OVERWHELMED.

18:41.587 --> 18:45.124
I MEAN,
IT'S A COMPLETELY RATIONAL
RESPONSE TO TRAUMA,

18:45.157 --> 18:46.726
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

18:46.759 --> 18:49.328
( laughs )
CAN YOU IMAGINE
IF IT WERE ANYTHING MORE?

18:49.362 --> 18:51.130
HOW WOULD WE TELL THE GIRLS?

18:51.163 --> 18:52.464
WHAT WOULD THEY CALL ME?

18:52.499 --> 18:53.833
UNCLE STEPDAD?

18:53.866 --> 18:55.602
( laughing )
OH, YEAH.

18:59.172 --> 19:02.541
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I'M GONNA HEAD HOME.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.243
- GOOD NIGHT.
- BYE.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.882
ARE YOU STILL
FEELING SICK?

19:08.914 --> 19:11.416
NO, THESE MEDS
ARE AWESOME.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.619
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
YOU LOOK STRESSED.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.488
I'M FINE.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.490
IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO SLEEP HERE.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.358
- I KNOW IT'S NOT
THE MOST RELAXING--
- NO.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.626
NO, BELIEVE ME,

19:20.660 --> 19:22.494
I DON'T WANT TO BE HOME
RIGHT NOW.

19:22.528 --> 19:24.396
BREN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:25.397 --> 19:26.766
I DON'T WANT
TO UPSET YOU.

19:26.798 --> 19:30.502
UH, I HAVE CANCER.
I'M ALREADY UPSET.

19:32.271 --> 19:34.641
OKAY.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.777
I'M KIND OF IN HUGE TROUBLE
AT SCHOOL RIGHT NOW.

19:37.809 --> 19:40.413
GREER AND I GOT CAUGHT
SNEAKING AWAY FROM THE ECO CLUB

19:40.445 --> 19:41.647
WHEN WE WERE IN FLORIDA.

19:41.681 --> 19:42.915
GOD, BREN.
WHY WOULD YOU--

19:42.949 --> 19:44.550
I WENT TO MEET NATALIE.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.286
WHAT?

19:46.318 --> 19:47.854
IT WAS A HUGE DISASTER.

19:47.886 --> 19:50.189
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE GONE.
AND NOW THE SCHOOL KNOWS

19:50.222 --> 19:51.557
THAT WE LIED BECAUSE
SOMEONE TOLD THEM

19:51.590 --> 19:52.858
AND I THINK IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN FORD.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.661
WAIT, HOLD ON.
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU TOLD MOM

19:54.693 --> 19:56.663
ABOUT NATALIE?
IS SHE FREAKING OUT?

19:56.695 --> 19:58.730
NO, I HAVEN'T
TOLD MOM WHAT HAPPENED YET.

19:58.765 --> 20:01.667
BUT WHEN I MET NATALIE,
SHE SAID THAT SHE'S MET MOM.

20:05.270 --> 20:07.707
THE SCHOOL SAID THAT I HAVE
TO TELL HER BY TOMORROW

20:07.740 --> 20:09.409
AND SHE IS GONNA KILL ME.

20:09.442 --> 20:12.711
LET ME HELP.
I CAN TALK TO HER FIRST.

20:12.744 --> 20:14.846
NO. NO, I'M THE ONE
WHO BROKE THE RULES.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.650
- I CAN DO IT.
- ARE YOU SURE?

20:17.683 --> 20:19.285
YOU HAVE ENOUGH
TO WORRY ABOUT.

20:19.318 --> 20:21.487
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BAIL ME OUT THIS TIME.

20:23.589 --> 20:25.290
OKAY.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.393
LET'S TRY AND GET
SOME SLEEP.

♪ I DON'T HAVE TIME ♪

20:31.396 --> 20:34.733

21:32.592 --> 21:35.294
WE WERE JUST GONE
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS,
I SWEAR.

21:35.327 --> 21:36.996
IN A CITY YOU'VE
NEVER BEEN TO BEFORE.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.664
DO YOU KNOW
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE

21:38.698 --> 21:40.532
YOU DIDN'T GET
INTO SERIOUS TROUBLE?

21:40.566 --> 21:41.968
I AM IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.503
FORGET ABOUT THE SCHOOL.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE SCHOOL,

21:44.537 --> 21:47.673
I CARE ABOUT YOU.
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN HURT,
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.

21:47.707 --> 21:48.875
YOU KNOW THE STORIES
THAT YOU HEAR

21:48.907 --> 21:51.510
ABOUT KIDS DISAPPEARING
ON CLASS TRIPS?

21:51.544 --> 21:53.378
THIS IS HOW
THAT STUFF HAPPENS.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.480
- I MEAN, WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING?
- I'M SORRY.

21:55.515 --> 21:58.384
WAS IT REALLY
SO IMPORTANT TO GO PARTYING
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND--

21:58.417 --> 22:00.752
- IT WASN'T LIKE THAT, OKAY?
- YOU SAID YOU WERE DRINKING.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.088
YEAH, BUT WE DIDN'T
DO THIS TO, LIKE,
GET DRUNK.

22:03.321 --> 22:04.957
WE WERE JUST
WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE--

22:04.990 --> 22:07.960
OH PLEASE. I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE
YOU WERE WITH.

22:09.761 --> 22:11.698
I WAS WITH NATALIE.

22:13.732 --> 22:14.701
YEAH.

22:14.733 --> 22:17.737
NATALIE ORTIZ,
MY SISTER,

22:17.769 --> 22:19.705
WHO YOU NEVER
TOLD ME ABOUT.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.740
( stammers )

22:24.109 --> 22:25.077
HOW DID YOU...

22:25.111 --> 22:27.079
APRIL TOLD ME.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.449
APRIL KNOWS TOO?

22:30.883 --> 22:32.984
I JUST WANTED TO MEET HER.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.686
AND I THOUGHT
MAYBE SHE COULD BE

22:34.721 --> 22:36.955
A BONE MARROW MATCH FOR APRIL
IF WE NEEDED ONE,

22:36.989 --> 22:39.826
WHICH WE DO NOW,
THANKS TO ME.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.663
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO START, I--

22:44.697 --> 22:47.767
I JUST WISH YOU HAD TOLD ME
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT

22:47.799 --> 22:50.403
INSTEAD OF TAKING MATTERS
INTO YOUR OWN HANDS.

22:50.435 --> 22:52.605
WELL, I GUESS SECRETS
RUN IN OUR FAMILY.

23:07.753 --> 23:09.454
YOU DIDN'T EAT ANYTHING.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.022
HUH-UH, I'VE BEEN SICK
ALL DAY.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.491
I CAN'T KEEP
ANYTHING DOWN.

23:12.525 --> 23:15.161
I'LL HAVE DR. HAMBURG
UP YOUR ANTI-NAUSEA MEDS.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.078
AM I DEAD?

23:36.883 --> 23:38.518
SO THIS IS A DREAM.

23:38.550 --> 23:41.052
( sighs )

23:41.086 --> 23:43.588
DAD, WHAT'S WRONG?

23:43.623 --> 23:46.125
IT'S JUST--
IT'S HARD TO SEE YOU...

23:46.159 --> 23:47.894
LIKE THIS,

23:47.926 --> 23:51.931
STUCK IN THIS BOX,
BOUND TO THESE TUBES
AND MACHINES.

23:51.963 --> 23:54.467
YOU SHOULD BE
OUT THERE LIVING.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.568
I'M TRYING TO GET BETTER
SO I CAN.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.672
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO DIE IN HERE.

24:01.574 --> 24:02.708
LIKE I DID.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.612
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING
THAT I DON'T?

24:06.645 --> 24:08.815
DAD.

24:08.847 --> 24:10.615
DAD, ANSWER ME!

24:10.650 --> 24:13.019
( breathing heavily )

24:15.788 --> 24:17.190
NO.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.494
( alarm beeps )

24:22.528 --> 24:24.462
Martine:
April, everything okay?

24:24.497 --> 24:26.598
YEAH.
YEAH, MARTINE.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.733
I'M JUST GONNA TAKE
A QUICK WALK.

24:28.768 --> 24:31.069
Got that energy back.
I'm proud of you.

24:32.872 --> 24:36.576
HEY, I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE
AND I NEED YOUR HELP.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.720
( breathing heavily )

24:53.159 --> 24:56.194
GEORGE, IT'S ME.
I'M AT THE HOSPITAL.

24:56.229 --> 24:57.930
APRIL'S MISSING.

24:59.531 --> 25:00.833
I DON'T KNOW.

25:02.634 --> 25:03.669
OKAY.

25:03.702 --> 25:05.238
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

25:05.270 --> 25:07.105
WHY ARE YOU
NOT LOOKING FOR HER?

25:07.138 --> 25:09.909
WE HAVE DR. HAMBURG
AND THE ENTIRE HOSPITAL
ON ALERT THAT SHE'S MISSING--

25:09.942 --> 25:12.545
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
I GOTTA LOOK FOR HER MYSELF.

25:21.653 --> 25:24.222
YOU'RE PRETTY RUDE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

25:24.257 --> 25:26.291
THEY LET ME CHECK OUT
OF THIS HELLHOLE TWO DAYS AGO

25:26.525 --> 25:29.095
AND THEN YOU
DRAG ME RIGHT BACK.

25:29.127 --> 25:31.130
I SHOULD GET
A MAILBOX HERE.

25:32.698 --> 25:33.798
ALL RIGHT, TALK TO ME.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.800
BUT REMEMBER,

25:35.835 --> 25:38.069
THIS CONVERSATION
MAY BE MONITORED
OR RECORDED

25:38.104 --> 25:39.838
BY GOD.

25:41.574 --> 25:43.276
I CAN'T DO THIS.

25:46.077 --> 25:49.915
ALL DAY, EVERY DAY,
I'M POKED AND PRODDED

25:49.949 --> 25:51.683
LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT.

25:51.717 --> 25:54.586
I'M SUFFOCATING

25:54.619 --> 25:57.990
IN EVERY WAY.

25:58.023 --> 26:00.159
THE AIR IN MY ROOM
IS STALE

26:00.192 --> 26:03.261
AND I JUST CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT EVERYTHING

26:03.296 --> 26:05.163
I'M NOT DOING.

26:05.196 --> 26:08.300
I LOOK OUT MY WINDOW
AND GET SO ANGRY

26:08.334 --> 26:12.104
WHEN I SEE ALL THESE PEOPLE
JUST LIVING THEIR LIVES

26:12.137 --> 26:15.340
WHILE I'M STUCK IN HERE
MISSING EVERYTHING.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.277
( sobbing )
AND I--

26:18.310 --> 26:20.246
I JUST HATE THAT FEELING.

26:20.278 --> 26:24.115
AND I SHUT MY BLINDS
SO I DIDN'T HAVE
TO LOOK AT IT ANYMORE.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.986
I JUST--
I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

26:28.153 --> 26:30.189
SO YOU CALLED ME?

26:30.221 --> 26:33.192
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT WOULD UNDERSTAND.

26:34.660 --> 26:37.063
EVERYONE WOULD
JUST FREAK OUT

26:37.096 --> 26:39.731
AND TELL ME I HAD TO STAY.

26:40.865 --> 26:43.035
SO ARE YOU GONNA
HELP ME BREAK OUT?

26:45.304 --> 26:47.038
BREAK OUT?

26:47.073 --> 26:49.875
APRIL, IT'S NOT JAIL.
YOU CAN CHECK OUT
OF HERE ANYTIME.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.912
THEN I WANNA DO THAT.
HELP ME.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.047
NO.

26:58.750 --> 27:01.354
I KNOW BEING HERE
DOESN'T...

27:01.386 --> 27:03.756
FEEL LIKE LIVING.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.156
BUT YOU GOTTA DO IT.

27:06.224 --> 27:07.292
WHY?

27:07.326 --> 27:09.327
YOU'RE GONNA BEAT THIS THING.

27:09.362 --> 27:11.830
I KNEW THAT THE DAY
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE SICK--

27:11.864 --> 27:15.300
AND THEN MOMENTS LATER
ASKED ME TO HELP YOU
GET INTO MY DAD'S EVENT.

27:15.334 --> 27:18.037
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

27:18.069 --> 27:21.740
YOU NEVER STOPPED
THINKING ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

27:22.942 --> 27:27.313
YOU REFUSED TO ACCEPT
THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ONE.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.784
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LIVE.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.320
I THINK YOU STILL KNOW THAT.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.189
THERE'S JUST THIS...

27:37.222 --> 27:40.792
POISON INSIDE OF YOU,

27:40.826 --> 27:43.695
THAT'S TRYING
TO MAKE YOU FORGET.

27:46.798 --> 27:48.099
BUT DON'T LET IT.

27:48.134 --> 27:50.135
( sobbing )

27:55.340 --> 27:57.175
COME ON.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.765
LEO?

28:19.798 --> 28:20.833
YEAH?

28:22.300 --> 28:24.702
I'M SCARED.

28:24.737 --> 28:27.472
TRUST ME,
YOU GOT THIS.

28:27.705 --> 28:29.107
NO, NOT ABOUT GOING BACK.

28:29.141 --> 28:32.211
I'M...

28:32.243 --> 28:33.913
I'M SCARED THAT WHEN
I GET OUT,

28:33.945 --> 28:36.848
YOU WON'T BE...

28:36.882 --> 28:39.050
ALIVE.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.752
THAT MIGHT HAPPEN.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.923
BUT YOU'RE ONLY UPSET
AT THE THOUGHT OF ME DYING

28:44.957 --> 28:48.827
BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU AWARE
OF YOUR OWN MORTALITY.

28:48.861 --> 28:52.064
I'M LIKE THE GRIM REAPER,
ONLY BLONDER.

28:53.798 --> 28:57.236
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY THOUGH?
DON'T FEAR THE REAPER.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.839
NO, YOU'RE NOT JUST A SYMBOL
OF SOMETHING TO ME.

29:01.906 --> 29:03.875
I THOUGHT
YOU KNEW THAT BY NOW.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.744
ESPECIALLY AFTER...

29:10.316 --> 29:12.050
AFTER WHAT?

29:12.084 --> 29:14.286
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
BETWEEN US RECENTLY

29:14.319 --> 29:15.453
THAT I ALREADY FORGOT ABOUT?

29:15.488 --> 29:18.057
YOU KNOW, MY MEMORY
SUCKS LATELY.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.892
I HATE YOU.
HOLD ON.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.460
YEAH.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.396
LOOK...

29:25.431 --> 29:28.134
I COULD NEVER FORGET
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
THAT NIGHT.

29:28.166 --> 29:30.402
BUT TRUST ME,

29:30.435 --> 29:33.005
I AM THE WRONG HORSE
FOR YOU TO BET ON.

29:33.038 --> 29:35.840
I'M THE ONE THEY TAKE
OUT BACK AND SHOOT BEFORE
THE RACE EVEN STARTS.

29:35.875 --> 29:38.376
BUT THAT OTHER GUY,

29:38.410 --> 29:41.980

MIGHT WIN IT FOR YOU.

I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST--

30:44.309 --> 30:46.010
I FELT LIKE THIS

30:46.045 --> 30:48.180
I...

30:48.213 --> 30:51.182
I ACTUALLY THINK
I'M REALLY OKAY NOW.

30:51.217 --> 30:52.317
George:
YOU SHOULD REST.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.452
YEAH, WE ALL SHOULD.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.588
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.856
AND, UM, I THINK
THERE'S SOMEONE HERE

30:58.891 --> 31:00.358
WHO WANTS TO SEE YOU.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.199

DOMINIC?

I'M SARA,
APRIL'S MOM.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.170
THIS IS APRIL'S
UNCLE GEORGE.

31:11.202 --> 31:12.270
- HI.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

31:12.304 --> 31:13.471
NICE TO FINALLY
MEET YOU TOO.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.374
WELL...

31:26.317 --> 31:29.355
SO THE NURSES WERE TELLING ME
THAT YOU DISAPPEARED TODAY.

31:29.387 --> 31:31.490
YEAH, UH...
SORRY.

31:31.522 --> 31:34.393
I JUST KIND
OF HAD A PANIC ATTACK
ABOUT BEING HERE.

31:34.425 --> 31:35.894
IT'S OKAY.

31:35.927 --> 31:38.364
I'D PROBABLY DO
THE SAME THING
IF I WERE YOU.

31:38.396 --> 31:43.035
( sighs )
I'M SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.037
ARE YOU FEELING BETTER
ABOUT WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT?

31:45.069 --> 31:47.306
WELL, I WAS.

31:47.338 --> 31:50.209
I ACTUALLY CAME
BACK HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT I WAS THINKING OF--

31:50.241 --> 31:52.111
STAYING IN TOWN
TO BE HERE FOR YOU.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.212
WAS?

31:56.347 --> 31:58.284
HOW'S LEO HENDRIE DOING?

32:00.618 --> 32:02.621
I SAW HIM
DROPPING YOU OFF.

32:02.654 --> 32:05.057
YOU WERE WITH HIM
WHEN YOU DISAPPEARED.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.924
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

32:06.959 --> 32:08.926
( sighs )

32:08.961 --> 32:12.163
WHEN I WAS DIAGNOSED,
I RAN INTO LEO

32:12.196 --> 32:17.068
AT A CANCER SUPPORT GROUP
AND WE SORT OF BECAME FRIENDS.

32:17.102 --> 32:19.371
YOU KNOW,
THE WHOLE CANCER CONNECTION.

32:19.404 --> 32:21.940
I JUST NEEDED
SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

32:21.973 --> 32:23.308
YOU COULD HAVE
TALKED TO ME.

32:23.342 --> 32:26.278
YEAH, BUT...

32:26.311 --> 32:28.212
IT'S JUST DIFFERENT.

32:28.247 --> 32:30.615
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE SICK

32:30.648 --> 32:33.018
AND YOU FIND
SOMEONE ELSE WHO'S SICK,

32:33.051 --> 32:35.653
YOU CAN HAVE
THESE CONVERSATIONS

32:35.688 --> 32:40.459
ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH
AND WHAT IT ALL MEANS.

32:40.491 --> 32:43.695
THAT'S ALL IT WAS?

32:43.729 --> 32:45.431
TALKING?

32:55.307 --> 32:56.709
( school bell rings )

32:58.277 --> 33:00.278
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
DON'T WE HAVE OUR MEETING?

33:02.247 --> 33:05.017
- THE SITUATION
HAS BEEN HANDLED.
- Sara: YOU'RE GREER'S PARENTS.

33:05.049 --> 33:06.617
I'M SARA CARVER.

33:06.652 --> 33:08.420
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

33:08.453 --> 33:10.055
I HOPE WE CAN MAYBE--

33:10.088 --> 33:11.390
HI, YEAH.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.726
THIS INCIDENT HAS BEEN
OFFICIALLY REMOVED

33:13.759 --> 33:16.595
FROM BOTH
OF THEIR RECORDS.
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

33:16.627 --> 33:19.030
HOW DID YOU
MANAGE THAT?

33:19.064 --> 33:21.500
WELL, APPARENTLY
CHARTON ACADEMY

33:21.532 --> 33:23.067
NEEDED A NEW FIELD HOUSE.

33:23.102 --> 33:26.704
OH, I'M SORRY.
I...

33:26.739 --> 33:29.441
IS THERE ANYTHING
I COULD DO TO COMPENSATE

33:29.474 --> 33:30.742
FOR BRENNA'S HALF
OF THIS?

33:30.776 --> 33:32.711
NOT THAT I CAN AFFORD
HALF OF A FIELD HOUSE, BUT--

33:32.744 --> 33:34.779
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

33:35.012 --> 33:37.348
ALL WE ASK
IS THAT THE GIRLS
STOP SEEING EACH OTHER.

33:42.721 --> 33:45.089
WHY?
BECAUSE I'M A GIRL?

33:45.124 --> 33:47.159
NOT AT ALL.
WE'RE PROUD OF GREER

33:47.192 --> 33:50.162
FOR FINDING HERSELF
AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.663
WE JUST THINK IT'S
IN OUR DAUGHTER'S
BEST INTEREST

33:52.698 --> 33:55.666
TO DATE SOMEONE
WITH SIMILAR AMBITIONS.

33:58.336 --> 33:59.371
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

34:03.474 --> 34:06.077
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY
THAT ABOUT MY KID
AND THEN WALK AWAY.

34:06.111 --> 34:07.712
I DON'T CARE HOW MANY
FIELD HOUSES YOU'VE BOUGHT.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.282
BRENNA IS A BRILLIANT GIRL.

34:11.315 --> 34:13.619
SHE'S HAD SOME
ROUGH CIRCUMSTANCES
TO DEAL WITH IN HER LIFE--

34:13.652 --> 34:14.786
- MOM!
- BUT AT THIS AGE,

34:14.820 --> 34:16.621
I WOULD HAVE NEVER

34:16.655 --> 34:19.056
HANDLED THEM WITH THE KIND
OF STRENGTH I SEE IN HER.

34:19.090 --> 34:21.393
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YEAH, SHE'S MADE SOME MISTAKES.

34:21.427 --> 34:24.463
BUT THEY'RE GONNA
MAKE HER ONE HELL
OF AN INTERESTING WOMAN.

34:25.664 --> 34:28.099
WELL, WE'D LIKE GREER
TO STAY AWAY FROM BRENNA

34:28.132 --> 34:30.235
WHILE SHE MAKES
THOSE MISTAKES.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.137
( silent )

34:37.409 --> 34:38.577
I'M SO SORRY.

34:38.610 --> 34:39.811
IT'S OKAY.

34:39.844 --> 34:43.449
LET'S JUST MOVE PAST
THIS WHOLE FLORIDA THING.

34:43.481 --> 34:45.717
NO, NOT JUST
THE FLORIDA THING.

34:45.751 --> 34:50.088
I'M SO SORRY THAT YOU HAVE
ONE PERFECT DAUGHTER

34:50.121 --> 34:51.722
AND ONE WHO'S JUST LIKE--

34:51.757 --> 34:52.824
HEY.

34:54.492 --> 34:58.764
I HAVE TWO
PERFECT DAUGHTERS.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.875
- WHEN WERE YOU GONNA TELL ME?
- I DON'T KNOW.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.244
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
IF YOU AND I WERE
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

35:12.277 --> 35:14.313
WHY DO YOU THINK
I CAME BACK HERE?

35:14.346 --> 35:16.181
I WANTED TO BE HERE
FOR YOU,

35:16.215 --> 35:17.882
LIKE AS YOUR BOYFRIEND.

35:18.115 --> 35:20.751
SINCE WE WERE
ONLY ON A BREAK
BECAUSE OF DISTANCE,

35:20.786 --> 35:22.420
I THOUGHT YOU
WANTED THAT TOO.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.422
I DID.
I STILL DO.

35:24.456 --> 35:27.759
THEN WHY DID YOU
CALL LEO TODAY

35:27.793 --> 35:28.893
AND NOT ME?

35:29.126 --> 35:31.262
I JUST--

35:31.295 --> 35:33.431
( sighs )
NEVER MIND.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.666
YOU CAN SAY IT.

35:34.699 --> 35:36.902
NO, I CAN'T.

35:37.135 --> 35:40.137
YOU'RE IN A HOSPITAL BED.

35:40.172 --> 35:42.740
I DON'T CARE.
IT'S NOT FAIR YOU CAN'T
HAVE A REACTION TO THIS.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.813
I FEEL STUPID.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.581
LIKE I WAS ALWAYS
MORE INVESTED

35:49.614 --> 35:51.449
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP
THAN YOU WERE.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.684
DOMINIC, THAT'S REALLY
NOT TRUE.

35:55.219 --> 35:57.489
I WOULD HAVE BEEN
THAT GUY FOR YOU, APRIL.

35:57.523 --> 35:59.858
I WOULD HAVE BEEN THE GUY
THAT YOU COULD CALL

35:59.891 --> 36:02.427
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE
WHEN YOU NEEDED SOMEONE.

36:02.460 --> 36:04.896
LIKE TODAY.

36:04.929 --> 36:07.199
BUT YOU NEVER
GAVE ME THE CHANCE.

36:07.231 --> 36:10.702
I WISH I COULD GO BACK
AND DO EVERYTHING DIFFERENTLY.

36:10.735 --> 36:12.737
( sighs )

36:12.771 --> 36:14.840
YOU ARE GONNA
GET BETTER, APRIL.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.677
YOU'RE ONE OF THE STRONGEST
PEOPLE I KNOW.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.878
YOU'VE GOT A LOT
OF REALLY GREAT PEOPLE
TAKING CARE OF YOU.

36:20.913 --> 36:24.516
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF.

36:31.789 --> 36:33.659
I'M SO SORRY.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.927
ME TOO.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.771
I THINK MY FAVORITE THING
ABOUT THE AFTERLIFE

36:45.804 --> 36:47.672
IS HOW YOU HAVE HAIR
EVERYWHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

36:47.706 --> 36:48.873
AND NONE WHERE
YOU DON'T WANT IT.

36:48.907 --> 36:51.476
LIKE I'VE GOT HAIR
ON MY HEAD AGAIN

36:51.510 --> 36:52.911
BUT I DON'T HAVE
A HAIRY CHEST ANYMORE.

36:52.945 --> 36:55.914
I'M BASICALLY LIKE
A MUCH HOTTER VERSION
OF MYSELF

36:55.947 --> 36:57.382
IN THE AFTERLIFE.

36:59.751 --> 37:03.288
SO YOU...
YOU DIED?

37:03.322 --> 37:05.856
UGH, YEAH.
( laughs )

37:05.891 --> 37:08.327
BUT IT'S OKAY.
SERIOUSLY.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.561
I LIKE IT HERE.

37:09.594 --> 37:11.762
I'M ALWAYS
THE YOUNGEST GUY AROUND.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.434
April:
GERALD!

37:16.467 --> 37:17.936
I TRIED TO FIND YOU
THAT DAY.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.670
I NEEDED
TO TALK TO YOU.

37:19.704 --> 37:21.706
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

37:21.739 --> 37:23.474
YOU DIDN'T NEED ME.

37:23.507 --> 37:24.976
YOU'RE DOING GREAT, KID.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.311
YOU'RE ONE
OF THE LUCKY ONES.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.246
HOW AM I LUCKY?

37:29.280 --> 37:31.750
I TRIED TO ESCAPE
THE HOSPITAL TODAY.

37:31.782 --> 37:35.721
WHEN YOU GET OUT OF THERE,
YOU'LL BE A SURVIVOR.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.856
AND TAKE IT FROM ME,
SURVIVORS ARE PEOPLE

37:37.889 --> 37:40.659
WHO APPRECIATE LIFE
THE MOST.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.594
YOUR LIFE IS ABOUT
TO GET SO MUCH RICHER.

37:51.469 --> 37:53.005
HI, DAD.

37:53.038 --> 37:55.574
I'M HOLDING YOU
TO WHAT YOU SAID.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.608
WHEN?

37:57.643 --> 38:00.344
RIGHT AFTER YOU FOUND OUT
YOU WERE SICK.

38:00.378 --> 38:03.715
YOU TOLD ME THAT I'D HAVE
TO WAIT AWHILE TO SEE YOU.

38:03.748 --> 38:05.416
YOU HEARD THAT?

38:05.449 --> 38:07.885
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T
READY TO GO YET.

38:09.655 --> 38:10.989
DID YOU MEAN THAT, APRIL?

38:11.023 --> 38:13.492
I DID.

38:13.525 --> 38:15.827
THAT'S MY GIRL.

39:13.050 --> 39:15.487
WHATEVER. YOU PROBABLY
DON'T EVEN HAVE CANCER.

39:15.519 --> 39:16.922
THIS WAS ALL
JUST SOME BIG PLOY

39:16.954 --> 39:18.356

39:21.827 --> 39:23.628

39:23.661 --> 39:26.530
SINCE DOMINIC DUMPED ME

39:26.565 --> 39:30.068
YEAH.
THAT SUCKED.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.503
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:32.536 --> 39:35.039
TODAY'S A NEW DAY.

39:35.072 --> 39:36.742

HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

40:05.536 --> 40:06.871
I HAD A MEETING
DOWN THE STREET

40:06.905 --> 40:08.672
AND I THOUGHT I'D COME BY
AND SEE HOW IT'S BEEN--

40:08.706 --> 40:09.940
GOING BACK TO WORK.

40:09.974 --> 40:12.409
IT'S BEEN OKAY.

40:12.443 --> 40:13.577
CHALLENGING.

40:14.813 --> 40:16.914
IT'S HARD TO LISTEN
TO SOME OF THE THINGS

40:16.947 --> 40:18.416
MY PATIENTS THINK
ARE TRAGEDIES,

40:18.449 --> 40:20.918
WHEN I'M DEALING
WITH MATTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH.

40:20.952 --> 40:22.887
I DON'T KNOW,
DOES THAT MAKE ME
A BAD THERAPIST?

40:22.920 --> 40:24.188
NO, IT JUST
MAKES YOU HUMAN.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.157
EVEN IF YOU'RE ONLY
HALF-TRYING,

40:26.190 --> 40:28.860
YOU'RE STILL SO MUCH BETTER
THAN MOST PEOPLE'S BEST.

40:28.893 --> 40:30.961
THANK YOU,
I APPRECIATE THAT.

40:30.996 --> 40:33.431
WELL, IT'S TRUE.
I MEAN IT.

40:33.465 --> 40:36.568
SO DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

40:36.601 --> 40:38.702
THE OTHER NIGHT AND WE
SAID THAT IT WAS NOTHING,

40:38.737 --> 40:40.704
IT WAS JUST A RESPONSE
TO TRAUMA?

40:40.739 --> 40:42.641
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

40:42.673 --> 40:47.211
WELL, I'D BE LYING
IF I KEPT SAYING THAT.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.949
26 YEARS AGO
WHEN I LEFT TOWN,

40:50.981 --> 40:52.851
AND I...

40:52.884 --> 40:55.052
I LEFT YOU,

40:55.085 --> 40:58.657
I OWNED THAT THAT
WAS MY CHOICE.

40:58.690 --> 41:01.092
AND I WAS GENUINELY HAPPY
WHEN MY BROTHER CALLED ME

41:01.126 --> 41:04.061
TO ASK FOR MY BLESSING
AND ASK YOU ON A DATE.

41:04.094 --> 41:07.532
BUT JUST BEING
BACK IN YOUR LIFE...

41:07.565 --> 41:09.701
ALL THESE FEELINGS
ARE COMING BACK

41:09.733 --> 41:13.170
AND I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER
IF YOU'RE FEELING THEM TOO.

41:21.545 --> 41:23.014
OH GOD.

41:23.047 --> 41:24.983
GET READY FOR
THE "WHY ME" LADY.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.786
NO, ACTUALLY
"WHY ME" LADY'S GRANDSON

41:27.818 --> 41:30.222
IS VISITING TODAY
SO SHE STOPPED SAYING
"WHY ME?"

41:30.255 --> 41:32.489
Lady:
WHY ME-EE?

41:32.523 --> 41:34.992
( laughs )
OH, I GUESS
HE JUST LEFT.

41:36.228 --> 41:38.496
WAIT, WHERE'S SOL?
HE'S NOT IN HIS ROOM.

41:38.530 --> 41:40.030
MARTINE, WHAT HAPPENED
TO SOL?

41:40.065 --> 41:41.932
OH, HE'S GONE, HONEY.
LAST NIGHT.

41:41.967 --> 41:43.568
HE DIED?

41:43.601 --> 41:46.938
NO, HE CHECKED OUT.
HE'S IN REMISSION.

41:46.972 --> 41:49.240
( sighs )
THAT'S AMAZING.

41:49.273 --> 41:51.842
I KNOW,
I'M AS HAPPY AS YOU ARE
THAT HE'S OUT OF HERE.

41:51.876 --> 41:54.112
IN MORE WAYS
THAN ONE.

41:58.782 --> 42:01.085
WHAT ARE LEO'S PARENTS
DOING HERE?

42:03.621 --> 42:04.922
( whispers )
BETH.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.126
( soft moan )

42:10.027 --> 42:11.228
APRIL, SLOW DOWN.
SLOW DOWN.

42:11.262 --> 42:13.030
- NO, SOMETHING'S WRONG.
- ( phone chimes )

42:16.233 --> 42:19.670
APRIL, THERE'S A VOICEMAIL
ON YOUR PHONE.

42:19.704 --> 42:21.639
IT'S FROM LEO.

42:23.842 --> 42:26.244
OH MY GOD.

42:26.277 --> 42:28.980
April, it's Leo.

42:29.014 --> 42:31.782
I have to tell you
something really important.
