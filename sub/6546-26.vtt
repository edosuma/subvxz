WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.333
(Audrey): Previously on Haven.

00:02.461 --> 00:03.416
- What does he want, Duke?

00:03.546 --> 00:07.004
- The controller crystal.
Deliver it to Croatoan.

00:07.133 --> 00:09.670
- The crystal or Lizzie?
- I'll be back in a few hours.

00:09.802 --> 00:11.087
With the crystal.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.632
- If we fold it here,
the crack in the core should close.

00:13.764 --> 00:14.970
(Nathan): The Aether core!
(Audrey): Got it!

00:15.099 --> 00:16.964
- No... you don't.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.801
(Audrey): Duke, who are you?

00:22.523 --> 00:23.763
- I'm Duke Crocker.

00:24.317 --> 00:26.057
Croatoan took everything from me.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.480
l have to choose my destiny.

00:28.613 --> 00:30.194
You have to kill me. Now!

00:30.323 --> 00:31.608
I can't do it myself.

00:31.741 --> 00:32.696
(Audrey): Nathan...

00:35.870 --> 00:38.031
What is that? Why is it...
- Turning black?

00:38.164 --> 00:39.870
lt's filling with Aether.
And soon...

00:39.999 --> 00:42.115
you and I will begin our work.

00:42.460 --> 00:44.246
Nathan told me he had said his goodbyes

00:44.378 --> 00:47.461
before he left with your copy.
(Audrey): His goodbyes?

00:47.590 --> 00:49.626
(Croatoan): Nathan is beyond the shroud.

00:49.759 --> 00:51.295
- At least we're together.
We'll figure it out.

00:51.427 --> 00:52.837
- We always do.
- Hmm...

00:53.304 --> 00:55.545
- Nathan abandoned you,
but not me.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.172
I will never abandon you.

01:02.897 --> 01:05.639
- Just tell them to stay
away from the cloud.

01:05.775 --> 01:08.687
- Gas leak at the new sewage plant, right?

01:08.819 --> 01:11.947
- Yeah, just tell everyone
to stay inside.

01:17.161 --> 01:19.823
Make sure to spend time
with your family today.

01:21.165 --> 01:22.996
- I don't really have one now.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.545
- I really could use you now.

01:39.350 --> 01:40.806
- We're in Maine.

01:40.935 --> 01:43.642
- Do you remember how we got here?

01:43.771 --> 01:46.513
- It's all blueberries,
lobster, and maple syrup.

01:47.942 --> 01:51.526
- And that says Cleaves Mills, Maine.

01:53.322 --> 01:54.402
- All right.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.570
- How do I remember you, Parker,

01:58.703 --> 02:02.867
but not where we lived,
worked, anything?

02:02.999 --> 02:04.205
- I don't know.

02:04.917 --> 02:08.250
- It's like we're books
with the important pages ripped out.

02:08.379 --> 02:09.585
-Yeah, well...

02:11.757 --> 02:14.169
at least we know the chapters
on each other.

02:17.179 --> 02:20.546
What?
- I don't know. Something just...

02:22.226 --> 02:23.887
feels weird.

02:24.353 --> 02:26.344
- You mean besides the fact
that we don't remember

02:26.480 --> 02:30.644
where we came from or what we did?
- Yeah. You don't feel it?

02:32.403 --> 02:35.315
Do we really know everything
about each other?

02:38.159 --> 02:41.117
- That old Bronco outside,
you say that it's practical,

02:41.245 --> 02:44.487
but it actually cost 300 a month
just to keep it running.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.659
- You keep it because
you don't like to negotiate,

02:46.792 --> 02:50.410
and you don't want a new car.
You love Patsy Cline,

02:50.546 --> 02:52.582
and you think
that you sing "Crazy" pretty well.

02:52.715 --> 02:53.921
- I do.
- But you don't,

02:54.050 --> 02:55.790
and because I was the first woman

02:55.926 --> 02:59.418
that you felt in years,
our sex life in the beginning

02:59.555 --> 03:00.965
was a little exciting,

03:01.098 --> 03:04.181
and for you, maybe it was
a little too exciting.

03:04.310 --> 03:07.643
- Okay, stop.
Stop. | get it.

03:07.772 --> 03:10.013
You really know me.
I'm sorry I doubted you.

03:10.149 --> 03:11.264
- Mm-hmm. I bet.

03:13.736 --> 03:14.691
So now what?

03:14.820 --> 03:17.983
- Well, I don't know.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.521
Breakfast?

03:23.037 --> 03:23.992
Hmm.

03:25.206 --> 03:28.494
There's no ID, no clues, but...

03:31.796 --> 03:33.036
200 bucks.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.252
- Whoa.

03:35.174 --> 03:36.755
Pancakes?

03:55.236 --> 03:58.273
(phone vibrating)

04:00.783 --> 04:01.898
- Vince.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.860
Yeah, I'm on my way.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.663
Dwight is giving the crystal to Croatoan.

04:13.796 --> 04:15.752
- He's getting it
from his hiding place right now.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.964
- But you're the controller.
I thought that made you the crystal.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.709
- Thus, my apprehension
and reason for my call.

04:21.846 --> 04:24.007
- Why is Dwight doing this?

04:24.140 --> 04:26.347
- He thinks the crystal
is useless to us now,

04:26.475 --> 04:28.090
and if he gives it to Croatoan,

04:28.227 --> 04:31.390
Croatoan will give him this in exchange.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.185
- Is that...?

04:36.318 --> 04:39.060
- Dwight's deceased daughter, Lizzie,

04:39.196 --> 04:42.233
or some remarkably
accurate version thereof.

04:42.700 --> 04:45.612
lt's striking.
- Oh, poor Dwight.

04:46.370 --> 04:49.032
- I believe he struggled
mightily with this.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.907
And thinking we had nothing to lose,
made this decision.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.374
- What do you think, Vince?

04:55.379 --> 04:58.667
Why does Croatoan want the crystal?
- To build you both a house.

04:59.550 --> 05:02.087
Someplace where you'll grow closer.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.629
- That'll never happen.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.926
But he said we already have a house.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.309
He's really proud of it.

05:09.435 --> 05:10.925
Vince, you've done this before.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.393
Can you search your program
and can you do that now?

05:13.522 --> 05:17.606
Is there any other possible
reason that Croatoan

05:17.735 --> 05:18.895
might want that crystal?

05:21.113 --> 05:22.193
- Mm.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.946
(exhales)

05:25.326 --> 05:26.782
- Come on, Vince.

05:30.581 --> 05:31.741
- My God.

05:32.625 --> 05:35.287
Because we can still use it
to build a Barn,

05:35.419 --> 05:38.707
one that would take him
and the Troubles back to the Void, forever.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.997
- How?
- It'll be hard.

05:42.927 --> 05:44.963
We'll need to do everything exactly right,

05:45.095 --> 05:48.303
but first we must stop Dwight
from handing over that crystal.

05:48.432 --> 05:51.265
Where's Nathan?
We should bring him.

05:56.607 --> 05:57.596
- Let's go.

05:59.068 --> 06:01.525
(somber folk music)

06:31.267 --> 06:32.598
- All right.

06:32.726 --> 06:36.514
Well, so the Bronco
has plenty of gas and Slim Jims.

06:36.647 --> 06:39.184
I called the DMV,
however, about our plates.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.728
Our tags have never been issued.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.142
- Of course.

06:46.699 --> 06:48.940
- You've got a map.
- Yeah.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.577
- So what are you thinking?

06:52.037 --> 06:53.243
- We head up the coast.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.117
- Okay. Why?

06:57.710 --> 06:59.041
I don't know.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.205
Just a feeling.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.999
Like our answer's there.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.426
(man): Hey, watch out.

07:08.387 --> 07:09.376
- Nathan.

07:10.306 --> 07:11.842
Hey, what happened to your head?

07:12.516 --> 07:14.848
- I don't know.
Did I hit it?

07:16.729 --> 07:18.060
- Or someone hit you.

07:23.861 --> 07:25.567
Hey, you know what? I...

07:26.530 --> 07:30.239
I'm starting to get a bad feeling
about us going up the coast.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.356
- Really?

07:31.493 --> 07:34.405
- Like maybe whoever
did that to you is there.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.369
- So shouldn't we check it out?

07:36.498 --> 07:39.080
- Yeah, but...

07:39.209 --> 07:41.621
couldn't we get settled
somewhere first?

07:43.714 --> 07:46.126
- You're worried
about what we'll find when we get there.

07:47.051 --> 07:50.714
- I don't know why, but a little, yeah.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.210
- Okay.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.350
We'll go inland.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.522
(thunder cracking)

08:11.450 --> 08:12.530
- We're almost ready.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.451
- You're a bastard.

08:19.291 --> 08:21.452
- At this point, I'd argue that I'm a saint.

08:21.585 --> 08:25.828
- I know what you're doing with Dwight.
I met with him.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.626
You broke his heart with Lizzie.

08:30.135 --> 08:33.969
- Is that what...
is that what I'm like with Nathan?

08:34.098 --> 08:37.636
- I gave Dwight what he wanted.
I gave you what you wanted. I...

08:38.852 --> 08:40.388
(gunfire, tires screeching)

08:40.521 --> 08:42.557
- We're not giving you what you want.

08:43.273 --> 08:47.016
You may have broken Dwight,
you may have gotten rid of Nathan,

08:47.152 --> 08:50.360
but there are still people here
who are willing to fight.

08:50.489 --> 08:51.979
Dwight won't make it back here.

08:52.116 --> 08:54.607
You're not getting the crystal.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.664
- He made it through the first group.

09:02.793 --> 09:05.159
(gunshots ringing)

09:05.295 --> 09:07.286
Don't aim. Just empty your clip.

09:09.258 --> 09:10.668
- McHugh, that's Dwight. Are you sure?

09:10.801 --> 09:12.132
- If you want this town to survive...

09:13.137 --> 09:14.627
just do it.

09:15.848 --> 09:18.840
(gunfire)

09:27.151 --> 09:29.016
(shouting)

09:36.702 --> 09:39.068
(gunshots ringing)

09:39.204 --> 09:41.195
(man): I think he went this way.
You see him?

09:41.331 --> 09:43.413
(woman): This way!
(man): Yeah, he's over there.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.703
Come on, move!
(gunfire)

09:48.839 --> 09:49.999
(woman): Keep going, keep going!

09:51.717 --> 09:53.708
- That's the old armory.
Looks like a damn fort.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.505
- That's okay. Spread out.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.343
Keep him pinned down in there.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.096
(man): This way, this way.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.716
(gunfire)

10:05.647 --> 10:08.605
Watch out, watch out!
- You think I'm cruel and brutish?

10:08.734 --> 10:10.770
You will learn that I am not.

10:14.948 --> 10:18.657
They landed in Haven Harbor.
If they can't swim, it's on them.

10:18.786 --> 10:22.153
Now let's get my crystal from Dwight.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.869
(winces)

10:26.543 --> 10:27.623
Do you have it?

10:28.587 --> 10:30.623
- Yeah.
- Good.

10:30.756 --> 10:33.714
There, you see,
Troubles can become powers.

10:33.842 --> 10:36.003
Bullets are drawn to your heart.

10:36.762 --> 10:42.473
Wear a bulletproof vest and voila,
you're unshootable.

10:42.601 --> 10:43.761
- But bruised.

10:43.894 --> 10:45.885
I think Vince took a
couple extra shots at me.

10:54.822 --> 10:55.777
- What is this?

10:55.906 --> 10:58.613
- You're on the inside
of the Barn now, Dad.

10:58.742 --> 11:01.654
The Aether in you is powering it.

11:02.538 --> 11:05.951
Vince requested that we start
with a nice strong structure,

11:06.083 --> 11:08.290
so Dwight helped us out.

11:12.256 --> 11:15.214
No, your Troubles won't work in here.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.082
(rumbling)

11:18.804 --> 11:20.635
Vince, what's happening?

11:20.764 --> 11:22.595
- I believe it's working,

11:22.724 --> 11:26.262
but it takes a minute
to ramp up, understandably.

11:29.731 --> 11:30.857
- You're a fool.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.349
- No, he's a good man,
and when he found out

11:33.485 --> 11:36.227
that there was still a chance
to build the Barn, he--

11:36.363 --> 11:38.979
- Barn takes me,
it takes your daughter as well.

11:39.116 --> 11:41.823
- She wasn't really my daughter.
Even if she was, it'd be hurting

11:41.952 --> 11:44.318
all the other people in this town.
I wouldn't do that.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.445
Not if we still have a
chance to beat you.

11:46.582 --> 11:49.665
(rumbling and static buzzing)

11:52.713 --> 11:53.953
- l'm failing.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.749
(dramatic music)

12:03.724 --> 12:05.430
- The person powering the Barn

12:05.559 --> 12:08.767
must ultimately do so voluntarily.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.978
(laughs)

12:11.106 --> 12:14.974
I do not... volunteer.

12:29.041 --> 12:31.908
You're going to have
to learn the hard way.

12:36.006 --> 12:39.089
(thunder cracks)

12:43.347 --> 12:45.963
I will force you
to use Aether on these people.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.680
You will remember who you are.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.061
You will embrace your talent.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.016
(thunder rumbling)

12:59.905 --> 13:02.317
- Dad, I know what you really want.

13:02.449 --> 13:06.283
You want to use me to punish
those who banished you to the Void,

13:06.411 --> 13:09.653
and l... I can do that.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.202
|... |wi|| do that.

13:12.334 --> 13:16.577
- If?
- If you take all of the Aether,

13:16.713 --> 13:21.707
all of the Troubles,
and you put them in me now,

13:22.719 --> 13:25.802
and we leave Haven forever.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.925
- How do I know that's even possible?

13:29.476 --> 13:30.841
- Because you were right.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.768
I am special.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.762
| feel the Aether.

13:35.899 --> 13:39.892
I felt it from the minute
you created that opening to the Void.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.944
But I'll create whatever
Trouble weapons you want.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.735
We don't need to waste time
experimenting on this town.

13:46.243 --> 13:47.574
You were right...

13:48.996 --> 13:50.406
Dad.

13:52.249 --> 13:55.457
- Dove, you are special.

13:55.836 --> 13:58.043
| just wish you were doing this
because you wanted to,

13:58.171 --> 14:02.460
not because you wanted to save the town.
No matter.

14:03.051 --> 14:06.418
You do this, and you
will embrace your power,

14:07.389 --> 14:09.471
and you will like it.

14:09.599 --> 14:12.591
So, yes, take all the Aether.

14:12.728 --> 14:15.720
Take all the Troubles, right now.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.864
(Duke): Rise and shine, Squatch.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.374
- Duke?

14:43.133 --> 14:45.875
- Let’s go.
Day/ight’s burning.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.342
You guys need my help.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.007
- Duke, you're dead.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.722
- Yes, lam. It doesn’t mean
you shouldn’t listen to me.

14:53.435 --> 14:54.641
Come on.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.409
- I thought we were going inland.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.449
I didn't want to come here.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.662
- I know.

15:17.459 --> 15:21.668
I started thinking that was... odd.

15:22.839 --> 15:25.171
You not wanting to investigate.

15:27.761 --> 15:28.921
So...

15:30.514 --> 15:31.594
what do you see?

15:35.685 --> 15:36.845
- Nothing.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.186
Not a damn thing.

15:42.484 --> 15:45.692
- So then let's go.
- But I feel something.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.397
- Really?

15:50.534 --> 15:53.776
That's new, because you can't feel anything.

15:54.704 --> 15:57.446
- But I remember feeling.

16:00.210 --> 16:03.077
I remember how,
when we get that low fog,

16:03.213 --> 16:04.453
you couldn't see the sun,

16:06.133 --> 16:08.374
but you could feel its warmth.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.052
It's like that.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.100
You don't feel anything?

16:20.814 --> 16:23.430
- Wind. Cold.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.775
The vague annoyance
at my usually awesome boyfriend.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.359
Can we please go? I'm freezing.

16:31.741 --> 16:32.901
- Sorry.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.736
ljust...

16:39.666 --> 16:41.281
I want to figure out what happened.

16:41.877 --> 16:44.539
| feel like the answer is here.
It's like...

16:45.755 --> 16:48.132
(sighs)

16:48.258 --> 16:49.418
lcantleave.

17:00.437 --> 17:03.304
(dark music)

17:09.029 --> 17:11.520
(938%)
What?

17:19.039 --> 17:19.994
What's wrong?

17:20.123 --> 17:21.784
- You were right.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.408
What you're looking for.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.625
It is here.

17:33.678 --> 17:34.758
Look.

17:43.355 --> 17:44.515
She's in there.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.514
- Who?

17:50.570 --> 17:51.559
- Me.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.275
(ominous music)

18:25.939 --> 18:28.021
Being so close to this, I...

18:28.775 --> 18:30.390
I'm beginning to understand.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.859
I remember.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.940
- What?

18:41.955 --> 18:44.287
l was to be her for you.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.871
To love you as much as she did,

18:51.214 --> 18:52.203
and I do,

18:53.717 --> 18:58.461
but I'm not her,
and you sensed that somehow, didn't you?

19:00.348 --> 19:01.724
That's what you were feeling.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.679
- I knew something was wrong, yeah.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.763
Why are you telling me this now?

19:19.034 --> 19:20.740
- Because I love you.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.693
And I want you to be happy.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.073
You should be with her.

19:29.586 --> 19:30.792
Come.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.332
- What happens when we go through there?

19:34.049 --> 19:35.289
- I'm not sure.

19:36.718 --> 19:37.958
- What happens to you?

19:40.930 --> 19:42.306
- This is right.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.300
Come.

19:47.437 --> 19:50.395
(poignant music)

19:59.115 --> 20:00.070
(knocking)

20:00.200 --> 20:01.440
- God.
- Need some help?

20:13.880 --> 20:15.791
(Audrey): Don't talk to Mara.
Talk to me.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.602
- Thank you.

20:36.820 --> 20:37.855
- We love you.

20:48.915 --> 20:49.995
(Dwight): Nathan.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.503
What happened?

21:00.677 --> 21:01.837
Was that Audrey?

21:03.012 --> 21:04.218
- No, ljust...

21:05.849 --> 21:07.259
| just realized that...

21:09.185 --> 21:10.220
she wasn't real.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.438
What are you doing here?

21:17.318 --> 21:19.525
- Duke brought me.
- Duke?

21:27.036 --> 21:29.413
- You can't see him.
Okay, why can't he see you?

21:29.539 --> 21:31.279
- I’m dead, Dwight.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.201
- You're pissing me off, Duke.

21:34.544 --> 21:38.287
- I don’t know why he can’t see me.
Maybe he feels bad about killing me.

21:38.882 --> 21:41.464
Tell Nathan where Audrey is.
She needs him.

21:41.885 --> 21:43.216
He has to get to her now.

21:43.344 --> 21:44.720
- Is that why you're here?

21:45.096 --> 21:46.256
- Just tell him.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.090
- He wants me to tell you Audrey's
in the old armory tower. She needs you.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.268
Go. Hurry.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.233
- You're not coming?

22:02.739 --> 22:05.276
- We’re not done, Dwight.
Come on.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.615
- Hey.

22:11.748 --> 22:14.114
Tell Duke I said thanks.

22:19.422 --> 22:22.004
- He says go get her, Nathan.
Save her.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.094
(Croatoan): There you go.

22:38.107 --> 22:40.598
That's my Dove.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.100
Can you feel it?

22:43.196 --> 22:44.231
- Yes.

22:44.906 --> 22:47.067
- That's wonderful.

22:51.955 --> 22:52.944
Keep your eyes open.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.279
Witness the power.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.141
- Nate.
Oh, my God.

23:16.813 --> 23:19.395
You're here.
You didn't leave me.

23:19.524 --> 23:20.809
- No.

23:22.235 --> 23:23.395
Neveh

23:31.661 --> 23:35.404
What Audrey is to me,
you could never copy that.

23:35.540 --> 23:36.871
Eveh

23:42.755 --> 23:44.370
(Croatoan): You will take the Aether!

23:46.134 --> 23:47.419
(gasping)

23:49.554 --> 23:52.421
(suspenseful music)

24:00.898 --> 24:00.977
(thunder rumbling)

24:00.982 --> 24:03.064
(thunder rumbling)

24:06.988 --> 24:09.650
- What did you do?

24:09.782 --> 24:10.942
- He did it to himself.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.326
- You fix him!

24:12.452 --> 24:13.362
- Why?

24:14.787 --> 24:17.244
- Because I love him.

24:17.582 --> 24:18.913
Because he loves me.

24:19.459 --> 24:22.075
Why can't you get that?

24:22.462 --> 24:24.418
He is my family,

24:24.547 --> 24:28.335
and he came back, back to save me.

24:28.468 --> 24:32.336
- That's what I'm doing
- You? No.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.801
You say you would do
all of this for me.

24:35.933 --> 24:37.764
That you want what's best for me.

24:37.894 --> 24:40.135
That you've sacrificed for me.

24:40.271 --> 24:41.807
- Yes.
- No!

24:41.939 --> 24:44.681
Everything you have done,
you have done for yourself.

24:44.817 --> 24:45.977
Your ego.

24:46.110 --> 24:47.771
Your victory.

24:48.905 --> 24:52.443
You sit here and you want
to talk about my potential.

24:53.326 --> 24:57.660
It is here, with Nathan.

24:58.998 --> 25:02.536
I found someone who loves me,

25:03.336 --> 25:06.419
who would do anything for me.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.287
- I would do anything for you, Dove.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.755
- Really?

25:11.761 --> 25:15.345
You would give your life for me?

25:16.307 --> 25:17.922
Like Nathan.

25:19.060 --> 25:23.144
Would you do that, Dad?

25:32.532 --> 25:34.068
(both yelling)

25:36.953 --> 25:39.820
(mysterious music)

26:33.050 --> 26:35.757
(sobbing)

26:39.015 --> 26:40.175
- You're right.

26:43.144 --> 26:45.510
I would not die for you like Nathan.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.613
But I will leave for you.

26:58.743 --> 26:59.778
- What?

27:01.162 --> 27:03.448
- There's nothing here for me without you,

27:04.457 --> 27:09.372
and there's nothing for me back home
without you by my side.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.218
So, yes, I will powerthe Barn.

27:16.344 --> 27:17.880
Take the Aether.

27:18.012 --> 27:20.378
End your Troubles forever.

27:29.816 --> 27:31.647
(laughs)
(barking)

27:33.569 --> 27:34.558
- Lizzie.

27:34.695 --> 27:36.606
- You can save her.

27:37.323 --> 27:40.281
- Is she gonna disappear
like that version of Audrey I saw?

27:40.409 --> 27:42.821
- Unless you believe she’s real.

27:42.954 --> 27:45.286
Even when it’s the hardest thing to do,

27:45.414 --> 27:47.700
you gotta believe she is real.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.665
- How do I do that?

27:55.258 --> 27:56.623
That's it?

27:56.759 --> 27:58.215
What about you?

27:58.761 --> 28:01.127
Are you even real?
Because I don't think this is something

28:01.264 --> 28:03.300
the real Duke Crocker would do.

28:03.432 --> 28:04.933
He was kind of a dick.

28:09.689 --> 28:12.772
(Lizzie laughing)

28:18.698 --> 28:21.610
- The Aether, it's coming down even harder.

28:23.953 --> 28:25.489
- Why hasn't it stopped?

28:25.621 --> 28:28.954
- The Void has smelled your world now,

28:29.876 --> 28:32.288
and it wants in.
- Our world?

28:33.963 --> 28:35.248
Not just Haven?

28:35.381 --> 28:37.838
Everything?
Everyone?

28:37.967 --> 28:39.457
- Yes, but I can stop it.

28:40.803 --> 28:42.885
I will willingly go into the Barn.

28:44.181 --> 28:46.012
If the Void did change me,

28:46.142 --> 28:50.010
perhaps this is the way
to show you who I once was.

28:53.566 --> 28:55.056
The father you loved.

28:58.988 --> 28:59.977
- Thank you.

29:02.700 --> 29:03.689
- Vince.

29:07.121 --> 29:10.705
Let us go.
You two may want to move out.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.573
- I don't think this is possible.

29:12.710 --> 29:13.870
- Vince, just do it.

29:14.003 --> 29:16.585
- Nathan, this won't work.

29:16.714 --> 29:17.874
You won't work.

29:18.007 --> 29:19.372
- Why? To power the Barn

29:19.508 --> 29:22.921
you need Aether activated
in living form, me.

29:23.054 --> 29:26.888
- I need more for the huge power
necessary for a Barn.

29:27.016 --> 29:31.680
The Aether needs a catalyst,
a complementary energy to supercharge it.

29:31.812 --> 29:36.101
The same energy it has always needed, love.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.727
The energy it needed
when she went in as Lucy and as Sarah.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.865
- l...
- You do not have that.

29:50.748 --> 29:51.703
-ldo.

30:03.052 --> 30:05.919
(somber music)

30:30.204 --> 30:32.991
Vince said that if I went
into the Barn with my father,

30:33.124 --> 30:36.287
I could activate the Aether in him...

30:37.253 --> 30:41.337
to stop the Void and the 27-year cycle.

30:41.465 --> 30:43.205
All the Troubled would live,

30:44.927 --> 30:47.134
and the Troubles would be gone forever.

30:48.973 --> 30:51.806
It would be finally over, Nathan.

30:53.769 --> 30:54.758
- Really?

30:54.895 --> 30:57.728
l was kind ofjust getting used to it.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.620
- l have to go.

31:17.126 --> 31:18.491
- You do.

31:18.627 --> 31:21.790
- And I won't be coming back this time.

31:24.133 --> 31:25.213
- I know.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.219
- I'm so sorry.

31:37.646 --> 31:40.308
- What do you have to be sorry for?

31:44.153 --> 31:45.984
- Leaving you.

31:50.159 --> 31:52.696
I wanted us to have more time.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.568
- We'll always want more time.

31:56.999 --> 32:01.038
The trick will be being thankful
for the time we had.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.417
We had an amazing time.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.708
- Yeah, we did.

32:09.845 --> 32:12.678
- And I spent so much of it
trying to keep you here,

32:13.849 --> 32:16.591
but now I realize
the reason I loved you...

32:17.394 --> 32:19.601
is because you're willing to go.

32:21.357 --> 32:25.600
You are an amazing person, Audrey Parker.

32:27.404 --> 32:30.066
I never felt anything till I met you.

32:30.199 --> 32:32.190
You saved me.

32:33.202 --> 32:34.908
You made me real.

32:37.414 --> 32:38.915
I love you, Audrey.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.781
I will always love you.

32:43.045 --> 32:47.038
- Nathan, promise me something?

32:48.425 --> 32:49.756
- Anything.

32:49.885 --> 32:51.625
- I want you to be okay.

32:54.390 --> 32:57.507
I don't want you to be alone,
so promise me that you will find someone,

32:57.643 --> 33:00.760
you will find someone that will make you
happy, and you will move on.

33:01.313 --> 33:04.555
(poignant music)

33:05.609 --> 33:07.770
(Nathan): Move on?
(Nathan scoffs)

33:10.239 --> 33:11.820
How could I ever do that?

33:14.743 --> 33:16.699
I will think about you

33:16.829 --> 33:20.868
every minute of every hour
of every day,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.742
and that’s Why [7/ be okay.

33:25.004 --> 33:28.337
After everything you’ve done
for the people in this town, for me...

33:29.216 --> 33:30.171
Parker. . .

33:38.976 --> 33:43.094
You’ll be with me every time
I feel something.

33:46.025 --> 33:50.109
You’ll be with me in all the people
whose pain you’ve taken away.

33:58.204 --> 34:01.822
With me and all the people of this town
who are free to live...

34:04.752 --> 34:05.867
and love...

34:07.129 --> 34:08.539
and grow...

34:10.299 --> 34:11.960
without fear.

34:17.681 --> 34:20.969
When the sun ﬁnal/y shines
on Haven again,

34:28.234 --> 34:31.351
you’ll be with me and all the families
that we put back together.

34:36.158 --> 34:39.025
And the ones out in the world
who suffered with Troubles too.

34:40.246 --> 34:42.737
You’ll be with me
when Haven returns to the world

34:42.873 --> 34:46.036
and becomes the town
that we both know it can be.

34:47.253 --> 34:49.744
And in every person that we gave hope,

34:51.423 --> 34:54.335
the faith that something good could happen...

34:56.220 --> 34:57.505
for all of us.

35:02.434 --> 35:05.551
You’ll be with me
in every person who’s happy now,

35:05.688 --> 35:07.053
at peace,

35:07.189 --> 35:09.305
because of you, Audrey.

35:10.067 --> 35:11.352
I’ll never forget you.

35:12.069 --> 35:14.105
You will always be with me,

35:15.239 --> 35:19.733
and no matter What happens,
I will always love you.

35:20.077 --> 35:22.033
(rumbling)

36:02.161 --> 36:05.278
- Miss Edwards thinks
the Higgs kids stole her clam rake.

36:05.414 --> 36:09.157
Mr. Millikin and Mr. Nick
want a noise variance for their party,

36:09.293 --> 36:12.285
and the Stanton kid, well,
he got pulled over in his golf cart.

36:12.421 --> 36:13.786
I think | smelled weed.

36:13.922 --> 36:15.378
- Cats in trees, Stan.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.790
Cats in trees.

36:18.927 --> 36:21.794
(phone vibrating)

36:24.016 --> 36:25.881
Hey.
How's retirement?

36:26.018 --> 36:27.053
- Busy.

36:27.853 --> 36:28.842
Awesome.

36:30.272 --> 36:32.228
Okay, listen, man, are you coming?

36:32.358 --> 36:35.475
I can't touch these worms,
and McHugh is hopeless.

36:35.611 --> 36:36.942
- Okay. I’m on my way.

36:37.071 --> 36:39.232
- You know, I enjoyed
having everybody shoot you.

36:39.365 --> 36:40.605
- Okay, hurry up.

36:42.284 --> 36:44.149
All right? Ready for another one?

36:44.286 --> 36:46.026
(Lizzie laughs)

36:47.664 --> 36:48.790
- Stan...

36:50.501 --> 36:51.786
I think you got this today.

36:53.003 --> 36:54.709
I'm gonna go fishing.

36:54.838 --> 36:57.375
- You know what, there's one more thing.
It's been a month.

36:57.508 --> 37:01.000
State historic society
wants to know why the armory collapsed.

37:01.512 --> 37:02.467
- Gas leak.

37:05.307 --> 37:06.467
I miss Vince and Dave.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.340
- Would they have known what happened?

37:13.190 --> 37:17.479
- Laverne, send the easy calls
to Stan today.

37:18.404 --> 37:21.441
Laverne?
- I am right here, hon.

37:21.573 --> 37:24.906
- Hey, I'm not used to seeing you
out of the dispatch room.

37:25.035 --> 37:28.072
- Spend a little time as a building,
you'd get out more too.

37:28.205 --> 37:29.160
- I bet.

37:30.791 --> 37:33.874
- Oh, by the way,
Gloria's looking for you.

37:34.002 --> 37:36.038
Says it's about the Troubles.

37:45.013 --> 37:49.256
- l was able to access old samples
of Troubled people's genetic material,

37:49.393 --> 37:52.556
and l cross-referenced it
with their genetic material now,

37:52.688 --> 37:54.929
and for the first time
since I've been alive,

37:55.065 --> 37:57.681
which, you know, let's be honest
is damn near recorded history,

37:58.861 --> 38:01.773
that DNA marker for Troubles,
it's gone.

38:01.905 --> 38:03.406
Completely.

38:03.532 --> 38:06.114
Like it's not coming back in 27 years.

38:06.243 --> 38:07.699
- Yeah, that's what I figured.

38:08.745 --> 38:09.996
- You're disappointed.

38:10.122 --> 38:12.113
- No, just...

38:12.249 --> 38:14.911
- You miss her.
- Yeah.

38:15.043 --> 38:16.499
- Well, maybe this will help.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.960
Vickie, give it to him.

38:23.886 --> 38:25.751
- Thanks, Vickie, it's beautiful.

38:25.888 --> 38:26.923
- Thank you.

38:28.724 --> 38:29.964
I love drawing again.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.899
- You know, there's another way
you can keep her alive.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.975
When you're not sure
what you should do,

38:41.111 --> 38:44.228
ask yourself what Audrey
would want you to do, and do that.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.112
That's what I do with Duke.

38:46.241 --> 38:48.402
- Duke. Really?

38:48.535 --> 38:50.912
- Duke and l, we were
a lot more alike than people knew.

38:52.039 --> 38:54.325
You want to talk to him, talk to me.

38:55.000 --> 38:55.989
- Okay.

38:56.710 --> 38:59.543
Well, right now I'm gonna
keep Audrey alive

38:59.671 --> 39:03.163
by doing what she would want me to do,

39:03.300 --> 39:05.916
and that is go fishing with Dwight.

39:06.053 --> 39:08.419
- Hmm.
- Bye.

39:08.555 --> 39:09.544
- Bye.

39:12.184 --> 39:15.051
(upbeat rock music)

39:18.732 --> 39:20.188
(Nathan): Oh, man...

39:28.742 --> 39:30.653
(sighs)

39:31.453 --> 39:34.695
- Why isn't it working?
ljust put gas in it.

39:34.831 --> 39:37.823
(sighs)

39:37.960 --> 39:40.042
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

39:40.170 --> 39:42.035
Is this a fuse thing?
(knocking)

39:42.172 --> 39:43.207
Oh!

39:48.637 --> 39:49.626
- Parker.

39:49.763 --> 39:54.257
- Well, I did, actually I didn't
park her as much as I broke her.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.975
But, do you think that you could help?

40:00.482 --> 40:02.097
- Yep. Yeah.

40:02.234 --> 40:03.519
- Oh, my God!

40:03.652 --> 40:07.565
- Oh, no, it's okay, it's okay.
I'm a... I'm a cop.

40:08.740 --> 40:09.695
- You're a cop?

40:11.076 --> 40:13.658
- I'm a... I'm Nathan.

40:14.621 --> 40:15.952
- All right, fine.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.823
That's good, Officer Nathan.

40:19.376 --> 40:21.662
l'm... I am broke down Paige.

40:21.795 --> 40:23.956
Do you think that maybe
you could help me start it?

40:24.590 --> 40:27.297
I've got to get James some food
before he has a meltdown.

40:27.426 --> 40:28.916
- James?
(baby cooing)

40:38.020 --> 40:39.601
- Hey.

40:43.483 --> 40:46.145
- It's... my son.

40:47.446 --> 40:48.401
- James.

40:50.407 --> 40:51.772
Mm-hmm.

40:51.908 --> 40:53.114
Yep.

40:53.243 --> 40:56.735
Uh, yeah, pop the... pop the hood.
- Okay.

40:58.540 --> 41:00.201
Pop the hood. Pop...

41:01.877 --> 41:04.789
Hood's popped!
- Yep. There we go.

41:11.553 --> 41:13.168
(mumbles under breath)

41:17.643 --> 41:19.429
Okay, uh...

41:21.313 --> 41:22.473
Try it now.

41:25.067 --> 41:29.401
- Ugh, no, Well, I don't really think
that that's a repair.

41:29.905 --> 41:33.318
(Nathan screams)
Ooh! Oh, God, are you okay?

41:36.203 --> 41:37.443
Are you okay?

41:39.665 --> 41:42.407
Let me at least take you to the hospital.

41:42.542 --> 41:44.123
- I'm okay.

41:44.252 --> 41:45.241
- Fine.

41:46.630 --> 41:47.585
- Yeah.

41:49.758 --> 41:50.873
- Well, can I at least...

41:52.344 --> 41:55.177
buy you... breakfast?

41:57.391 --> 41:59.473
Do you like pancakes?

42:00.268 --> 42:02.099
- Yeah, I love pancakes.

42:03.355 --> 42:04.515
- Me too.

42:08.276 --> 42:11.268
- Are you sure
she couldn't go back as Audrey?

42:11.405 --> 42:12.565
- Oh, yes.

42:13.740 --> 42:16.607
But she knew if she went back
as someone else,

42:16.743 --> 42:19.735
she and Nathan
would fall in love all over again,

42:19.871 --> 42:21.611
and it appears she was right.

42:22.833 --> 42:24.994
# Because I really love you #

42:25.127 --> 42:28.711
# Stop! [7/ be thinking of you #

42:28.839 --> 42:31.330
# Look in my heart and let love #

42:31.717 --> 42:34.709
# Keep us together#

42:35.721 --> 42:36.927
# Whatever #

42:37.055 --> 42:38.261
# Ba-da-da, whatever#

42:38.390 --> 42:41.723
# I Will, I Will, I Will #

43:03.248 --> 43:06.081
