Don't sweat it, I love
working on these old beauts!

They may have a lot of light years
on 'em, but they were built to last!

01:01.061 --> 01:04.273
Sylvia'll have you up and running
in no time, Ms. Starbella!

01:04.523 --> 01:06.483
Oh, please, call me Stella.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.111
But again, I really don't need any help!

01:09.278 --> 01:11.029
Oh, it's no trouble at all!

01:11.113 --> 01:13.323
We saw you floatin' out
here all by your lonesome

01:13.407 --> 01:15.909
and figured, "it never hurts to help!"

01:16.410 --> 01:19.037
Suit yourself. But there's no need.

01:19.121 --> 01:23.166
That engine's been on the fritz since I
defeated Mandrake the Malfeasant,

01:23.250 --> 01:27.379
in the Battle of Planet X,
thus ending his tyrannical reign!

01:29.131 --> 01:33.886
My pilot man-at-arms, Mittens,
handles all the repairs himself.

01:33.969 --> 01:36.471
(SADLY) But he's being a bit aloof today.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.600

02:07.211 --> 02:09.254
Is it in with the instructions?

02:09.421 --> 02:11.507
Or maybe you could call
the customer service?

02:11.590 --> 02:13.509
Not sure we have that kind of time!

02:13.926 --> 02:15.886
Uhh... Maybe you have it written down?

02:16.178 --> 02:18.472
Well, I don't know. Is it Mittens?

02:19.139 --> 02:20.933
Have you met Mittens?

02:43.163 --> 02:45.123
STELLA: Don't you, Mittens?

02:46.041 --> 02:48.961
Sylvia, I'm really worried that...

02:49.044 --> 02:51.380
It's not just Ms. Stella's engine
that needs a jump-start?

02:51.463 --> 02:53.674
Yeah. And though she says she doesn't,

02:53.757 --> 02:58.679
-I really think that... (GASPS)
-She really does need our help.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.472
Yeah. So I think...

03:00.556 --> 03:03.308
We should stick around and
make sure that she really is okay?

03:03.392 --> 03:05.727
-Yeah! 'Cause...
-There's no telling what being all alone

03:05.811 --> 03:07.020
in deep space can do to you?

03:07.104 --> 03:11.275
I knitted you both sweaters. The
evenings out here get awfully drafty.

03:15.153 --> 03:20.325
Mayday! Mayday! If anyone is out there,
Sherblorg 7 is under attack!

03:20.450 --> 03:22.828
Please! Anyone! We need help!

03:23.203 --> 03:25.497
Wander, Sherblorg 7 needs
our help right away.

03:25.581 --> 03:29.251
I know, but we can't just leave
Stella here alone and helpless.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.086
We've got to make sure she's okay.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.838
Now, who wants to play rummy?

03:33.839 --> 03:36.758
All right, but in order to fix the ship,
I need you to ask Ms. Starbella

03:36.842 --> 03:40.053
if she has a supersonic-socket wrench.
Now, hurry!

03:40.387 --> 03:44.558
Oh, I know I had a supersonic-socket
wrench here somewhere.

03:44.808 --> 03:45.976
Ooh, careful.

03:46.435 --> 03:50.189
Saved it from when I overthrew
an organized time syndicate.

03:50.314 --> 03:57.112
Maybe it's in... Oh! "Send Donnie Burn's
grandson a graduation card". I did that.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.910
Sherblorg 7, come in, Sherblorg 7.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.454
Oh, thank Grop!

04:05.537 --> 04:08.665
Yes! Um, signal received,
we're coming to rescue you!

04:08.916 --> 04:11.418
-Oh, thank Grop!
-We'll be there right away!

04:11.668 --> 04:12.920
(EXCITEDLY) Oh, thank Grop!

04:13.128 --> 04:14.671
STELLA: Maybe it's in my pocketbook.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.632
Please hold!

04:18.425 --> 04:19.426
Oh, Grop!

04:24.515 --> 04:26.808
No. That's my change purse.

04:28.435 --> 04:32.147
Wha... That's a satchel!
Oh, wait! What's that up there?

04:34.858 --> 04:38.320
STELLA: My cookie jar!
Been looking all over for that.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.656
You want some cookies? I'll make cookies.

04:40.739 --> 04:41.740
No!

be taking you so long?

05:07.057 --> 05:11.478
Oh, look. Supersonic-socket wrench.

05:16.859 --> 05:20.654
Fixed it. Sherblorg,
Sherblorg 7, we are on our way!

05:20.821 --> 05:22.573
Don't bother. We've been captured.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.367
SHERBLORG KING: You're too late.
Hope you got your wrench.

05:27.202 --> 05:30.122
STELLA: Shame! Someone should try
and help those nice folks.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.835
(IN UNISON) Stella?

05:34.918 --> 05:36.879
That's Starbella!

05:39.131 --> 05:41.884
And Sherblorg 7 needs my help!

05:56.398 --> 05:59.818
-Sylvia, I think...
-She's completely lost her marbles?

06:00.777 --> 06:02.196
No. There they are!

06:03.739 --> 06:06.909
Sherblorg 7, this is Vengastar.
We're entering your system,

06:06.992 --> 06:10.829
so would you please be a dear and
prepare for rescue? Thank you!

06:30.057 --> 06:31.934

-What happened? -And where's Stella?

06:42.110 --> 06:45.239
-We gotta find her before she does
something really... -Kooky!

Prepare to meet your (WHEEZING) doom!

06:54.873 --> 06:57.835
Oh, poop! I'm in no hurry to do that.

06:58.919 --> 07:03.423
(IN UNISON) Ahh!

07:09.012 --> 07:10.180
Ms. Stella! Are you okay?

07:10.264 --> 07:14.393
It's Starbella. And I already told you,
sweetie, I don't need your..

with the skull and fish faces what a

but I've never conquered your heart.

Good Grop, Mandrake,
can't we just have a good time?

08:23.504 --> 08:28.759

11:12.798 --> 11:15.759
-Sir, we're not even in the Top Ten.
-What!

11:15.843 --> 11:20.347
We're way down here between Something

11:28.564 --> 11:30.065
I don't even think he has a house!

11:30.482 --> 11:33.986
Sir, if you want to make it back onto
the Top Ten, you have to stop viewing

11:34.069 --> 11:37.781
Wander as a threat and focus on
actual villains that are actual threats.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.408
Like Dominator! (GRUNTS)

11:39.491 --> 11:40.826
Let's start with General McGuffin.

11:41.660 --> 11:45.289
Now, our spies have located a weak spot
in the force field around McGuffin's

11:45.372 --> 11:47.249
heavily fortified military stronghold.

11:47.416 --> 11:51.712
We sneak in, deactivate the force field,
take his base, and steal his territories.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.590
Called, that'll pad our
planetary numbers quite nicely.

11:55.007 --> 11:57.843
Point me at him!
I'll deep fry the feathers off him!

11:58.010 --> 12:01.597
Love that enthusiasm, but this
will be a delicate covert operation

12:01.680 --> 12:03.765
with lots of twists and turns.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.684
I need your undivided attention.

12:06.101 --> 12:08.645
PEEPERS: Do I have
your undivided attention?

12:09.438 --> 12:13.609
Absolutely! Nothing will distract
me from taking out these losers

12:13.692 --> 12:18.614
and re-becoming the
Greatest in the Galaxy!

12:22.743 --> 12:24.119
Tag! You're it!

12:31.376 --> 12:32.586
Oh, no!

12:34.963 --> 12:36.673
Commander Peepers.

12:37.007 --> 12:40.844
I believe you were going to
brief us on your invasion plan.

12:41.637 --> 12:44.181
You... You're not gonna
flip out and chase after him?

12:44.890 --> 12:48.143
Please. Do you think I'm
going to let some silly game

12:48.227 --> 12:51.897
ruin my chances at galactic superiority?

12:52.356 --> 12:55.192
Uh, you do seem to do that a lot, so...

12:55.692 --> 12:57.486
Well, of course not, sir.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.947
Glad to see you've got
your eyes on the prize.

13:00.572 --> 13:03.742
Now, General McGuffin's base
has 32 separate sentry turrets

13:03.825 --> 13:06.537
surveying 45 degree angles
in varying intervals.

13:06.787 --> 13:09.915
After fording the perimeter moat,
which is crawling with water Wingmen,

13:10.040 --> 13:13.001
we'll hit the infinity minefield
full of self-preparing mines.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.420
I'm not gonna lie, not all of you are
gonna make it back through that one.

13:15.754 --> 13:18.674
I'm looking at you, Pat.
The secondary moat is tricky.

13:18.882 --> 13:21.468
PEEPERS: It's rigged with alarm
sensors that can tag our presence

13:21.552 --> 13:24.763
and it alternates its pattern. If
you're tagged, it is imperative

13:24.847 --> 13:27.808
that you tag its it-it
while it tags the it-it tag.

13:27.891 --> 13:32.104
It-it-tag-tag-it-tag-it-it-tag-tag-tag-it.
Y'all got that?

13:33.355 --> 13:35.107
Great. 'Cause this is
where it gets tricky.

13:35.190 --> 13:37.609
PEEPERS: Because everything
we've just encountered

13:37.693 --> 13:41.780
is actually a mass hallucination induced
by General McGuffin's psychic battalion.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.658
PEEPERS: We have to confront our
innermost fears in order to defeat them,

13:44.825 --> 13:48.328
awake from the dream state and then start
the whole thing over again from step one.

13:49.288 --> 13:51.164
The conference table is base!

13:53.959 --> 13:56.336
-What was that?
-Nothing. Totally paying attention.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.548
Good. Now, once we've escaped
to that alternate timeline...

13:59.715 --> 14:03.218
(WHISPERING) Psst! Barry,
take your hand off the table.

14:05.137 --> 14:09.057
Oh, no! There's a big scary
monster under the table,

14:09.224 --> 14:12.978
and he's, like, totally gonna eat you
unless you run away from the table!

14:13.061 --> 14:15.105
Run, Barry, run!

14:16.023 --> 14:19.776
Barry! As your Supreme Leader, I'm warning
you to take your hand off the table!

14:21.737 --> 14:25.490

14:38.086 --> 14:40.923
-No tag backs!
-(ROARS)

14:44.468 --> 14:48.263
Which leads us to Step 47A,
subsection B, 4th appendix.

14:48.472 --> 14:50.641
Now that we've cleared the
outer-inner-inner-outer perimeter,

14:50.724 --> 14:52.726
we have to circumvent
the inner-inner-inner-outer...

14:52.851 --> 14:56.480
Okay, who can I tag? Who can I tag?
Who can I... Bingo!

14:56.647 --> 14:59.149
...posted at the turrets each grew
up in different time zones,

14:59.233 --> 15:02.194
so their Circadian sleep rhythms
will be all out of sync. Question, sir?

Bathroom break! I need a bathroom break!

15:08.492 --> 15:12.621
(ALL SCREAMING)
-Get back here! Slow down!

15:13.664 --> 15:16.875
Okay, New plan. If we want to have
any chance of pulling this off,

15:16.959 --> 15:18.669
one of you is going to
have to let him tag you.

15:18.961 --> 15:22.005
Uh, sir? What don't you let him tag you?

15:24.800 --> 15:29.012
No! Of course that wouldn't work
because as his second in command

15:29.096 --> 15:30.430
I can't be it because...

15:31.181 --> 15:32.391
Well, fine!

15:33.809 --> 15:35.060
You're all a bunch of babies!

15:35.143 --> 15:39.648
(ALL SCREAMING)
-Everybody get back here!

15:40.941 --> 15:45.654
Sir, in the interest of the invasion,
I have decided to let you tag me.

15:45.737 --> 15:48.574
Thanks, C-Peeps. Tag you...

15:48.657 --> 15:51.869
Yoah! Sorry, sir. I must
have tripped. Go ahead.

15:54.371 --> 15:55.706
Peepers!

15:55.789 --> 15:56.915
I don't know what's come over me.

15:57.082 --> 15:59.835
I promise, sir, this time
I will remain completely still.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.841
(PEEPER SHRIEKS)
Sir, I don't wanna be it!

16:07.009 --> 16:10.345

17:04.566 --> 17:09.112
Oh, no! You accidentally froze
Lord Hater in Coldbrrnite!

17:09.238 --> 17:12.616
Yes, "accidentally".
And that's exactly what we'll tell him

17:12.699 --> 17:16.328
when we unfreeze him after we break
into General McGuffin's fortress.

17:20.832 --> 17:27.589
Finally, I have your undivided attention.
So, let's talk about your feelings.

17:49.319 --> 17:52.406
Have you ever considered a
healthier outlet for your aggression?

17:52.489 --> 17:54.116
You could be a pastry chef.

17:54.199 --> 17:56.076
Eww! No! I've tasted your cooking.

17:56.243 --> 17:59.621
Ooh, or a professional luchador!

There, there! It's not gonna be okay.

21:33.710 --> 21:37.089
Now, General McGuffin's base
has 32 separate sentry turrets,

21:37.297 --> 21:39.883
surveying 45 degree
angles in varying intervals.

21:39.967 --> 21:42.845
After fording the perimeter moat,
which is crawling with water wingmen,

21:42.928 --> 21:45.889
we'll hit the infinity minefield,
full of self-preparing mines.

21:46.056 --> 21:48.642
I'm not gonna lie. Not all of you are
gonna make it back to that one.

21:49.059 --> 21:52.062
I'm looking at you, Pat.
This is where it gets tricky,

21:52.145 --> 21:53.647
because everything we've just encountered

21:53.730 --> 21:57.651
is actually a mass hallucination induced
by General McGuffin's Psychic Battalion.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.528
We have to confront our innermost fears

21:59.611 --> 22:01.488
in order to defeat them,
awake from the dream state,
