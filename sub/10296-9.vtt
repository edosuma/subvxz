Hi.

01:18.934 --> 01:20.400
Hi, hi, hi.
How are you?

01:23.534 --> 01:26.434
Gee, I just
love bowling.

01:26.434 --> 01:28.133
The sound
of the pins,

01:28.133 --> 01:30.033
the feel
of the ball,

01:30.033 --> 01:31.534
the smell of...

01:31.534 --> 01:33.834
dead farm animals.

01:35.334 --> 01:37.000
Oh.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.400
Ugh!

01:40.067 --> 01:41.267
Peg, I'm going
for a beer.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.300
You want something?

01:42.300 --> 01:43.734
Yeah.

01:43.734 --> 01:45.567
Yeah, well, I'm sure a waitress
will be along in a minute.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.133
Oh, Peggy!

02:01.133 --> 02:02.133
Oh, hi.

02:02.133 --> 02:03.601
I didn't
see you there.

02:03.601 --> 02:08.734
Oh, Mimi... That is you
under that bad dye job.

02:12.567 --> 02:13.701
Oh, kids, kids,

02:13.701 --> 02:15.100
come meet
an old woman.

02:15.100 --> 02:18.033
Peg, I'd like you
to meet the twins,

02:18.033 --> 02:20.033
Roscoe and Frank.

02:20.033 --> 02:22.067
Gee, they don't look alike.

02:22.067 --> 02:25.234
Same father?
Or should I say, donor?

02:27.434 --> 02:31.400
Peg, so life hasn't been
too good to you, huh?

02:31.400 --> 02:32.834
I don't work.

02:32.834 --> 02:34.334
Well, I don't
work, either.

02:34.334 --> 02:36.133
I don't do anything.

02:36.133 --> 02:38.434
Neither do I. I have a maid.

02:38.434 --> 02:39.701
Not me.

02:39.701 --> 02:43.434
My house is a sty,
and I don't care.

02:43.434 --> 02:46.200
Hiya, babe.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.701
That's my
husband, Chuck.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.200
You poor thing.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.033
Oh yeah?
But he has a...

02:52.033 --> 02:53.767
[WHISPERS]

02:57.467 --> 03:00.467
It was so nice
seeing you again, Peg.

03:00.467 --> 03:03.200
Yes, and nice
to see you too.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.868
God, I hate her!

03:10.067 --> 03:12.501
What an idiot.

03:12.501 --> 03:13.901
Look at that stupid little hop.

03:13.901 --> 03:15.701
Does she really think
that she's going to get--

03:15.701 --> 03:17.868
Strike!

03:17.868 --> 03:18.868
Your turn, Peg.

03:18.868 --> 03:21.000
Oh, no, Al. I can't.
She's watching me.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.667
The minute I get up there,

03:23.667 --> 03:25.267
she's going to bet
that I can't strike

03:25.267 --> 03:26.968
like she did,
and she'll be right.

03:26.968 --> 03:30.501
It'll be just like high school
all over again.

03:30.501 --> 03:33.367
Peg, I'm looking at both of you.

03:33.367 --> 03:36.534
Believe me, it won't be
like high school.

03:36.534 --> 03:38.467
I don't know.

03:38.467 --> 03:42.334
I kiss you and I kiss you
and you're still a frog.

03:42.334 --> 03:45.667
Anyway, when we were in school,
we would bet on everything.

03:45.667 --> 03:47.267
We didn't have
a lot of money then,

03:47.267 --> 03:48.434
so we'd bet pride.

03:48.434 --> 03:50.200
You know, we'd pick
something humiliating,

03:50.200 --> 03:54.100
and then the loser, me,
would have to do it in public.

03:57.834 --> 04:00.601
Ooh! Nice spare, honey!

04:03.200 --> 04:05.400
Watch me and want me.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.934
Stee-rike!

04:17.934 --> 04:18.934
Yay!

04:18.934 --> 04:21.000
Al got a strike.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.467
My husband is better
than your husband

04:22.467 --> 04:23.868
more than you're
better than me.

04:23.868 --> 04:25.934
Oh yeah? Well, my kids
are better than your kids

04:25.934 --> 04:27.133
better than I'm better than you.

04:27.133 --> 04:29.767
Yeah, well, you're aging badly.

04:29.767 --> 04:33.467
Oh yeah? Well how about
a little family bowl-off?

04:33.467 --> 04:35.934
No.

04:37.801 --> 04:39.367
What do you mean, no?

04:39.367 --> 04:42.767
I can bowl that doofus
off the face of the earth.

04:42.767 --> 04:43.767
We can beat them.

04:43.767 --> 04:45.734
Yeah, but Mimi's better than me.

04:45.734 --> 04:47.534
Not since
Bud's taking bowling lessons.

04:47.534 --> 04:49.300
He says he's bowling 130.

04:52.634 --> 04:56.067
Look at "eight eyes"
over there.

04:56.067 --> 04:57.667
They're pathetic.

04:57.667 --> 04:59.300
Even though Kelly stinks
like you,

04:59.300 --> 05:01.167
what with me and Bud
taking up the slack,

05:01.167 --> 05:02.868
we can't lose.

05:02.868 --> 05:04.501
Go ahead, bet.

05:04.501 --> 05:05.501
Mimi!

05:05.501 --> 05:06.901
Yes, Peggy?

05:10.567 --> 05:11.934
Okay, it's a bet.

05:11.934 --> 05:13.868
Saturday night,
family bowl-off,

05:13.868 --> 05:15.133
8:00 sharp.

05:15.133 --> 05:16.868
Fine.

05:16.868 --> 05:20.000
Okay, now for the bet.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.267
Let's see...

05:22.267 --> 05:23.601
Loser sniffs
every bowling shoe

05:23.601 --> 05:26.267
in the alley.

05:26.267 --> 05:27.868
N-no.

05:27.868 --> 05:29.367
Okay, all right.
Okay...

05:29.367 --> 05:33.033
Um, winner walks the loser
through the mall on a leash?

05:34.801 --> 05:35.834
No.

05:35.834 --> 05:37.234
All right,
okay, okay.

05:37.234 --> 05:40.734
Uh, loser runs through
the bowling alley naked.

05:40.734 --> 05:42.701
No!
No!
No!
No!

05:46.567 --> 05:47.601
I know.

05:47.601 --> 05:49.334
The loser, you,

05:49.334 --> 05:51.367
will have to dress
like a human trophy

05:51.367 --> 05:54.634
and pose for pictures
with everybody in the alley.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.834
Okay, it's a bet.

05:58.834 --> 05:59.734
Good.

06:01.701 --> 06:05.334
Oh, Peggy, I'd like you
to meet my daughter, Didi.

06:05.334 --> 06:08.834
That's two I's,
not four E's.

06:08.834 --> 06:12.567
Gee, you have
beautiful children.

06:12.567 --> 06:14.200
Yeah, right.

06:14.200 --> 06:17.033
But Didi can break 200.

06:18.267 --> 06:20.701
Hey, now, wait a second.
That's five.

06:20.701 --> 06:22.067
We don't have five.

06:22.067 --> 06:23.400
Oh, gee, Peggy...

06:23.400 --> 06:25.634
Surely you must have
some relatives somewhere

06:25.634 --> 06:27.834
you can de-louse
and trot out?

06:31.133 --> 06:32.534
No bet!

06:32.534 --> 06:34.968
Oh, fine, Peggy. I understand.

06:34.968 --> 06:38.968
Kids, take a look
at a born loser.

06:38.968 --> 06:41.634
Kids, take a look
at a bald woman.

06:44.133 --> 06:45.567
Ooh! Ooh!
Why, I ought to--

06:45.567 --> 06:47.067
I never liked you!

06:47.067 --> 06:50.067
Let go of my hair!
I hate you!

06:50.067 --> 06:52.067
Ugh! Do I hate her!

06:52.067 --> 06:55.567
Well, at least you got
that souvenir.

06:55.567 --> 06:57.300
It's just not enough.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.601
I really wanted that bowl-off.

06:59.601 --> 07:02.534
I just know we could have won
if we'd had five.

07:02.534 --> 07:04.000
Why didn't we have
another child?

07:06.734 --> 07:09.067
Sorry.

07:09.067 --> 07:11.000
[DOORBELL RINGS]

07:16.534 --> 07:18.033
Well, there goes
my day.

07:18.033 --> 07:19.534
What do you want?

07:19.534 --> 07:20.534
Hey, we're friends.

07:20.534 --> 07:23.367
Can't we drop over
for no reason?

07:23.367 --> 07:25.634
No.

07:25.634 --> 07:27.167
Why are you here?

07:27.167 --> 07:29.200
We set off a bug bomb.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.901
We can't go back
for another 10 minutes.

07:31.901 --> 07:35.167
So, what's going on?

07:35.167 --> 07:36.968
I'm a little down tonight.

07:36.968 --> 07:40.334
I ran into an old friend
that I hate more than life.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.734
Did you ever go to school
with someone

07:42.734 --> 07:44.334
who does everything
just a little bit better

07:44.334 --> 07:45.534
than you do?

07:45.534 --> 07:46.868
Barb Lehnhardt.

07:46.868 --> 07:48.868
What?

07:48.868 --> 07:51.167
My rival was
Barb Lehnhardt.

07:51.167 --> 07:52.601
It started in kindergarten.

07:52.601 --> 07:55.667
I let Don Thudey
kiss me on the cheek.

07:55.667 --> 07:58.000
She showed him her underpants.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.734
First day of gym,
I was wearing a t-shirt.

08:01.734 --> 08:03.701
She was wearing a bra.

08:03.701 --> 08:06.267
I finally had a chance
to beat her

08:06.267 --> 08:07.467
at our high-school reunion.

08:07.467 --> 08:08.934
I couldn't wait.

08:08.934 --> 08:11.267
I had a great job,
a terrific husband,

08:11.267 --> 08:12.767
and I'd lost 10 pounds.

08:12.767 --> 08:15.267
Then she went
and died a tragic death,

08:15.267 --> 08:18.300
and that's all anyone
could talk about.

08:18.300 --> 08:21.300
"Poor Barb."

08:21.300 --> 08:23.400
"Poor Barb."

08:23.400 --> 08:26.067
They could care less
that I was a success.

08:26.067 --> 08:28.834
Her decapitation
got all of the attention.

08:31.467 --> 08:34.133
It was so Barb.
God, I hate her.

08:34.133 --> 08:35.667
Well, my Barb is Mimi Stoatz,

08:35.667 --> 08:38.701
and I have finally got a shot
at beating her at bowling,

08:38.701 --> 08:41.868
and I'm not going
to get the chance.

08:41.868 --> 08:44.834
I'm one bowler short,
and I needed a good one.

08:44.834 --> 08:47.434
Done.

08:47.434 --> 08:49.334
You know somebody?

08:49.334 --> 08:50.367
I sleep with him.

08:50.367 --> 08:53.501
Shh! Who?

08:55.601 --> 08:57.601
Steve.

08:57.601 --> 08:59.601
Oh. Steve?

08:59.601 --> 09:01.100
Look at him.

09:01.100 --> 09:04.868
His lithe, wiry body
was made for bowling,

09:04.868 --> 09:08.367
and he does a heck
of a little mambo too.

09:08.367 --> 09:11.167
Al, Steve can bowl!

09:11.167 --> 09:13.033
You bowl?

09:13.033 --> 09:16.033
Well, I don't like to brag.
Marcy?

09:16.033 --> 09:18.400
He's a wonderful bowler, Al.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.901
What do you bowl?

09:19.901 --> 09:21.634
Uh... Marcy?

09:21.634 --> 09:23.501
About 165.

09:23.501 --> 09:26.234
Uh, 170.

09:26.234 --> 09:27.734
Steve,
you're a godsend.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.234
I need you
to be my ringer.

09:29.234 --> 09:32.234
Will you bowl for me
Saturday night?

09:32.234 --> 09:34.734
If I still can
after you let go of me.

09:34.734 --> 09:36.234
Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

09:36.234 --> 09:38.234
It's Saturday night
at 8:00.

09:38.234 --> 09:40.634
All you have to do
is bowl great

09:40.634 --> 09:41.834
and be a Bundy.

09:41.834 --> 09:43.367
Yeah, right.

09:43.367 --> 09:46.033
When I grow fur
and marry Cheetah.

09:47.501 --> 09:48.968
Not a chance!

09:48.968 --> 09:51.300
Besides, no one would
believe I'm a Bundy.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.734
We'll Bundy you up.

09:53.734 --> 09:56.200
I don't want to be Bundied up.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.434
What if you do it
and I can't come back?

09:58.434 --> 10:00.834
Steve, please.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.133
Do it for me...

10:02.133 --> 10:04.834
And I'll do it for you.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.234
Let's bowl!

10:12.367 --> 10:13.868
We're going to do it, Peg!

10:13.868 --> 10:15.501
We're going to beat
the Stoatz family!

10:20.067 --> 10:22.067
Hey, kids,
come on over here!

10:22.067 --> 10:23.534
It's time for the Bundy cheer!

10:23.534 --> 10:24.567
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

10:24.567 --> 10:26.868
Come on
over here.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.434
Whoa, Bundy!

10:32.434 --> 10:34.267
Great news, kids.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.467
We are going
to bowl against

10:35.467 --> 10:38.033
the hated Stoatz family
Saturday night.

10:38.033 --> 10:39.167
Bowl?

10:39.167 --> 10:40.834
Yes, and we're really
looking forward

10:40.834 --> 10:42.467
to your 130.

10:42.467 --> 10:45.601
I love you, Bud.

10:45.601 --> 10:48.634
Hey, I'm giving up
a Saturday night here.

10:48.634 --> 10:50.167
Doesn't anyone
love me?

10:50.167 --> 10:52.501
Kelly, you bowl a 60.
What do you want?

10:52.501 --> 10:56.000
Peg, let's go upstairs
and call Mimi

10:56.000 --> 10:57.200
and tell her the bet's on.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.701
Oh... You better dial,

10:58.701 --> 11:01.701
because I'm saving
my hand for bowling.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.367
You make me sick.

11:05.367 --> 11:06.868
Bud's the smart one,

11:06.868 --> 11:08.367
Bud's the good one,

11:08.367 --> 11:09.868
Bud's the hero.

11:09.868 --> 11:11.868
Yeah, yeah, I'm giving up
a great date,

11:11.868 --> 11:14.300
but who cares, because I stink.

11:14.300 --> 11:16.267
So go ahead and gloat.

11:16.267 --> 11:19.367
[SIGHS]

11:19.367 --> 11:20.634
Well?

11:20.634 --> 11:23.200
Kelly, the only reason
I'm telling you this

11:23.200 --> 11:25.701
is because you're so used
to failure.

11:25.701 --> 11:26.901
So maybe
you can tell me

11:26.901 --> 11:28.434
how to break this
to Mom and Dad.

11:28.434 --> 11:31.467
That money I took
for bowling lessons...

11:31.467 --> 11:36.701
I now have a lifetime pass
to the Pussycat Theater.

11:36.701 --> 11:39.000
And I can't bowl worth a damn.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.667
Wait, you're not kidding me,
are you?

11:41.667 --> 11:43.734
No, Kel.

11:43.734 --> 11:45.734
Oh, God! I love you!

11:45.734 --> 11:48.634
You're not going
to tell, are you?

11:48.634 --> 11:50.601
Tell, and give up
counting the beads of sweat

11:50.601 --> 11:51.834
forming on your forehead

11:51.834 --> 11:55.734
because you've ruined
your mother's life?

11:55.734 --> 11:57.234
Oh, no, Budrick.

11:57.234 --> 12:01.501
I plan to be just as stunned
as the rest of the family.

12:01.501 --> 12:04.501
Bud, a liar?

12:04.501 --> 12:05.834
[GASPS]

12:07.033 --> 12:09.267
Okay, the bet's made.

12:09.267 --> 12:10.834
Oh, and did I tell you?

12:10.834 --> 12:14.334
The loser has to dress up
as a human trophy.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.834
Oh, the humiliation!

12:15.834 --> 12:17.901
I'm finally going to beat her.

12:17.901 --> 12:20.300
Thank you, Bud.

12:20.300 --> 12:24.400
Yes! Thank you, Bud!

12:24.400 --> 12:25.868
I'm the good one now.

12:25.868 --> 12:27.567
[LAUGHING]

12:33.534 --> 12:35.267
Bud, where's Mom and Dad?

12:35.267 --> 12:38.434
They went to Bowl Town.
Dad needed some stuff.

12:38.434 --> 12:40.200
What am I going to do, Kel?

12:40.200 --> 12:42.367
Stink and be punished.

12:42.367 --> 12:44.367
Oh, God, this is great,

12:44.367 --> 12:47.000
and it's only
the first day.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.167
Gee, the pressure
must be terrible.

12:50.167 --> 12:53.167
Oh, oh, could you do me a favor?

12:53.167 --> 12:54.734
Right after
your first gutter ball,

12:54.734 --> 12:56.534
and I get that picture
of Mom and Dad

12:56.534 --> 12:58.033
and their looks
of disappointment and horror,

12:58.033 --> 13:00.167
could you
kind of tilt your chin up

13:00.167 --> 13:02.167
so that the light catches
that tear

13:02.167 --> 13:05.267
streaming down your face?

13:05.267 --> 13:07.667
You're dirt, Kel.

13:07.667 --> 13:10.634
Yes, but everybody knows it.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.701
Howdy, teammate.

13:14.701 --> 13:18.334
Bud's a 130 bowler,
you know.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.667
Uh, listen, Bud,
are your folks in?

13:23.667 --> 13:28.100
I want to ask them
if I could be an adopted Bundy.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.601
That would help explain

13:29.601 --> 13:32.868
my hygiene, grammar,
and full set of teeth.

13:32.868 --> 13:34.567
Mr. Rhoades,
could you do me a favor

13:34.567 --> 13:36.901
and run over my hand
with your car?

13:36.901 --> 13:40.300
When will
this punk stuff end?

13:40.300 --> 13:42.000
A mangled hand

13:42.000 --> 13:44.267
is not what you're going to want
when you're 40, young man.

13:47.067 --> 13:48.567
Mr. Rhoades, sit down.

13:51.267 --> 13:54.133
Have you ever lied
to your mother?

13:54.133 --> 13:55.868
Of course not.

13:55.868 --> 13:59.634
Well, I did tell her
I was the bank president,

13:59.634 --> 14:02.968
but I will be some day,
so that's not really a lie,

14:02.968 --> 14:04.367
is it?

14:04.367 --> 14:07.501
What did you do?
I told her I could bowl.

14:07.501 --> 14:10.000
Well, of course you can bowl.
You're a Bundy.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.167
A failed Bundy.

14:12.167 --> 14:14.367
She's counting on me,
and I'm going to let her down.

14:14.367 --> 14:16.701
Well, how about this?

14:16.701 --> 14:18.300
I have to believe

14:18.300 --> 14:20.000
that somewhere
in your chromosomes,

14:20.000 --> 14:21.400
there lies a bowler.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.901
We got six days.

14:22.901 --> 14:25.400
Let's you and I go to the lanes
and practice. You pay.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.701
You've got a deal.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.968
And buy me an ice cream.

14:29.968 --> 14:32.968
Don't push it,
Mr. Rhoades.

14:32.968 --> 14:34.467
All right.

14:34.467 --> 14:36.334
A lot can be accomplished
in a week.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.300
Now, let's see
your form.

15:04.434 --> 15:06.000
Good, good.

15:09.434 --> 15:11.934
Al, it's 7:15!

15:11.934 --> 15:14.200
If we don't get there
by 8:00, we forfeit!

15:14.200 --> 15:16.367
Come on, honey!

15:16.367 --> 15:17.767
AL: I'm ready!

15:30.634 --> 15:32.133
What is that?

15:32.133 --> 15:35.133
It's my pro-bowler
automatic thumb warmer,

15:35.133 --> 15:36.968
limited edition.

15:39.100 --> 15:42.000
Let's get us
some Stoatz meat.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.467
Whoa, Bundy!

15:48.167 --> 15:50.334
Okay, okay, so
you've touched paws.

15:50.334 --> 15:52.200
Can we bowl now?

15:52.200 --> 15:54.801
My daughter's on her way.
We'll wait for her.

15:54.801 --> 15:56.033
Uh-uh. Not a chance.

15:56.033 --> 15:58.100
She gets a zero
for every frame she misses.

15:58.100 --> 16:01.667
Wait a second.
Who's this guy?

16:03.133 --> 16:04.267
Cousin Steve.

16:04.267 --> 16:05.767
I smell a ringer.

This guy's no Bundy.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.667
I'm sorry I'm late.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.167
I really wanted to be here
to see your face

17:52.167 --> 17:54.634
when Bud bowled his...

17:54.634 --> 17:56.300

17:56.300 --> 17:58.400
By the fourth frame?

17:58.400 --> 18:00.901
Bowling lessons pay off, Kel.

18:00.901 --> 18:02.400
Thank God for Bud.

gorgeous boy in school,

it's Saturday,
I'm young,

18:12.434 --> 18:13.868

Okay, you show them
what you got, Roscoe.

18:15.868 --> 18:16.901
Yeah, Roscoe.

18:16.901 --> 18:18.267
You know, I can't
believe you.

18:18.267 --> 18:20.767
Just once, I would like
to see you do something

18:20.767 --> 18:22.901
to help your family.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.667

our final frame

20:07.467 --> 20:08.968
and we need 23 pins.

That's all I ever
hear from you.

20:38.334 --> 20:40.367
For my next ball,

20:40.367 --> 20:44.434
I'd like a steak dinner
with all the trimmings.

20:44.434 --> 20:47.067
I'll even
make potatoes.

We need
three pins to win.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.801
Three pins! Oh!

You have the sex drive
of a stone,

Let's see, which one
should I get?

21:10.767 --> 21:15.100
The 1-2-3, the 3-4-5,

21:15.100 --> 21:18.534
or the ever-tricky
1-7-9?

21:18.534 --> 21:20.534
Just bowl, you moron.

21:20.534 --> 21:22.334
Okay, kids,
get out the cameras.

is about to be made.

I don't know
what happened, Peg.

21:46.567 --> 21:47.934
The ball
must have slipped.

21:47.934 --> 21:51.801
Somebody must have tampered
with my thumb warmer.

21:51.801 --> 21:54.434
But I still bowled a 175, Peg.

21:54.434 --> 21:56.868
Good, Al.

No, I mean it, Peg.
I'm upset about this.

21:59.534 --> 22:00.834
You know how much
this thing cost?

Are you going to be
much longer, Peg?

22:03.267 --> 22:04.601
The kids
are getting hungry.

Just go home, Al.

you'll be okay?

Get the hell
away from me, okay?
