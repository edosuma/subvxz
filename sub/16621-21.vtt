00:03.703 --> 00:05.637
You look and sound worse

00:05.672 --> 00:08.173
than when we pulled you
out of Laos.

00:08.208 --> 00:09.574
Dark days.

00:09.609 --> 00:11.643
There's still time
to figure this out,

00:11.678 --> 00:14.379
but it's finally just a
lifetime of bad decisions.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.681
My time in the Triangle...
Agent Orange.

00:16.716 --> 00:19.551
I'm so sorry.

00:19.586 --> 00:22.320
HETTY:
<i> Where is Owen Granger? </i>
This is for you.

00:22.355 --> 00:25.724
HETTY'S VOICE:<i> "Don't blame</i>

00:25.759 --> 00:29.561
<i> "but I've had enough</i>

00:29.596 --> 00:33.065
<i> "and I have some unfinished</i>

00:36.770 --> 00:38.336
NELL: Admiral Albert
Jethro Chegwidden.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.238
Former Navy SEAL,
commander of JAG.

00:40.273 --> 00:42.174
Henrietta called,
said she was in trouble,

00:42.209 --> 00:44.376
so here I am--
once more into the breach.

00:56.656 --> 00:58.657

RADIO WEATHERMAN:

MAN:
Good morning. You have yourself
a beautiful day.

01:10.137 --> 01:11.169
Good morning to you.

01:11.204 --> 01:13.238
Oh, you...

01:13.273 --> 01:16.541
Thank you, God bless you.
You're a angel.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.511
You know, I need this
more than you would ever...

01:19.546 --> 01:23.148
All right, then.

01:23.183 --> 01:24.249
Hello, there.

01:24.284 --> 01:25.650
How are you today?

01:25.685 --> 01:28.587
Mm-hmm.
All right.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.689
Hey!

01:30.724 --> 01:33.158
Mr. Mercedes.
Mmm!

01:33.193 --> 01:34.459
Roll your window down a sec.

01:34.494 --> 01:36.661
Come on.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.530
It's another fine day
in La La Land.

01:38.565 --> 01:40.465
You should roll
your window down.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.568
Take it in.
Savor it.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.239
What the...

01:47.274 --> 01:49.541
Whoa, hey, hey.
Stay out of my car, man.

01:49.576 --> 01:50.809
I said stay out
of my car!

01:50.844 --> 01:53.311
You run, I shoot you.

01:53.346 --> 01:55.580
I got money.
I will give you money.

01:55.615 --> 01:56.681
But first, you need
to put the gun away

01:56.716 --> 01:57.482
and get the hell out
of my car.

01:57.517 --> 01:59.317
Put your seat belt on.
Okay, fine.

01:59.352 --> 02:00.519
How's 20? Is 20 good?

02:02.289 --> 02:03.288
That's 53.

02:03.323 --> 02:04.389
I don't carry cash on me.

02:04.424 --> 02:05.390
I use credit cards.

02:05.425 --> 02:06.691
Look, it's 53 bucks.

02:06.726 --> 02:09.227
It's all I have, take it.

02:09.262 --> 02:13.899
I said put your seat belt on.

02:15.735 --> 02:16.768
(tires screeching)

02:20.273 --> 02:22.174
¶ ¶

02:58.245 --> 02:59.611
How long have you
been in here, Beale?

02:59.646 --> 03:02.247
Smells like it's been
at least two hours.

03:02.282 --> 03:03.949
It has not been
two hours, it's...

03:05.485 --> 03:07.719
...closer to three.

03:07.754 --> 03:09.554
That thing's not
gonna shoot itself.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.423
Promise?

03:11.458 --> 03:13.792
You want to talk?

03:13.827 --> 03:16.261
Talk? No.
I'm-I'm-I'm fine.

03:16.296 --> 03:17.295
Actually, I'm good.

03:17.330 --> 03:18.663
You know, uh...

03:18.698 --> 03:22.234
Nell has switched back
to her 2014 shampoo.

03:22.269 --> 03:23.401
You know, the coconut/mango one,

03:23.436 --> 03:26.605
so I'm-I'm-I'm-
I'm good.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.873
All right, all right.
I'll see you in there.

03:28.908 --> 03:30.342
Okay. Sam?

03:32.445 --> 03:35.647
I have not fired my gun
since I went undercover

03:35.682 --> 03:36.715
at the couples retreat.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.883
Since you blew up the SUV.

03:38.918 --> 03:41.553
With a person inside of it.

03:41.588 --> 03:42.721
First time.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.958
Taking a man's life
is a horrible thing,

03:46.993 --> 03:52.430
but it was necessary
in this case.

03:52.465 --> 03:55.500
Uh, I-I know that,

03:55.535 --> 03:59.337
but I wish that I could
forget it ever happened.

03:59.372 --> 04:01.673
The opposite.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.842
You have to acknowledge
what you did,

04:03.877 --> 04:05.810
process it for what it is--

04:05.845 --> 04:07.779
a job that had to be done.

04:07.814 --> 04:10.282
It's not for everyone,
and that's okay.

04:10.317 --> 04:12.517
That's why whose
who can handle it

04:12.552 --> 04:13.952
protect those who can't.

04:16.489 --> 04:17.722
Do you ever struggle with it?

04:17.757 --> 04:20.925
At first I did,
but, you know,

04:20.960 --> 04:22.995
the path became clear.

04:25.865 --> 04:27.899
Must be nice.
Listen, Beale,

04:27.934 --> 04:30.001
only you can decide
which side you're on.

04:30.036 --> 04:32.804
Either one is okay,
but you can't be both.

04:34.974 --> 04:36.341
(knock on door)

04:38.945 --> 04:41.380
Duty calls.
It always does.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.823
CALLEN:
What do we got?

04:51.858 --> 04:53.024
Not much.

04:53.059 --> 04:55.760
No surveillance video,
no solid eyewitnesses,

04:55.795 --> 04:58.496
but VA Administrator
Robert Bryant

04:58.531 --> 05:00.799
was apparently kidnapped
on his way to work this morning

05:00.834 --> 05:03.034
in his own car
by a homeless man.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.370
There was a kidnapping
in broad daylight,

05:05.405 --> 05:07.505
and no one can ID this guy?
DEEKS: I buy it.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.708
People treat the homeless
like they're invisible.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.110
A few witnesses say it may have
been an older black man,

05:12.145 --> 05:13.545
but that is all we have.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.380
The secretary of
the VA would like

05:15.415 --> 05:17.382
NCIS's assistance
on this case.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.084
So they're hoping it was
an everyday carjacking,

05:19.119 --> 05:21.386
and not a disgruntled vet,
correct?

05:21.421 --> 05:23.388
Ding, ding, ding.
I'm guessing we're not

05:23.423 --> 05:25.056
the only agency working on this.
NELL: We're not.

05:25.091 --> 05:27.425
And the secretary would,
and I quote,

05:27.460 --> 05:29.728
"be obliged if we could
find out who did this

05:29.763 --> 05:31.396
before anyone else does."
All right.

05:31.431 --> 05:32.497
Why don't you two head
down to the VA and talk

05:32.532 --> 05:33.665
to his coworkers?

05:33.700 --> 05:35.533
See if he had
any troubles before this.

05:35.568 --> 05:36.668
Sam, what do you think,
Bryant's house?
Yep.

05:36.703 --> 05:37.669
No, we could go
to Bryant's house.

05:37.704 --> 05:38.937
Where's that, in Hancock Park?

05:38.972 --> 05:41.072
Is it a Lloyd Wright?
Maybe it's a Wallace Neff.

05:41.107 --> 05:42.674
Kensi here is a Neff-head.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.642
Or we can just ignore
you and head to the VA.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.411
Yeah, we could do that,
too, I guess.

05:49.115 --> 05:52.417
(indistinct radio chatter)

05:52.452 --> 05:54.986
SAM: I don't want to hear it.
CALLEN: Wasn't even thinking it.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.389
SAM: The algorithm is
pre-conceptually false.

05:57.424 --> 05:59.724
You can't calculate
traffic patterns in a vacuum

05:59.759 --> 06:01.626
without accounting
for human error.

06:01.661 --> 06:02.994
Ah, the mighty Sam Hanna
is human.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.929
I didn't err, G.

06:04.964 --> 06:07.432
Took a principled stance
not to use Waze.

06:07.467 --> 06:08.967
I know, that's why we're late.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.535
NCIS Agent Callen.

06:10.570 --> 06:11.970
This is my partner,
Agent Sam Hanna.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.005
Ah, NCIS in the flesh.
Mmm.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.874
I just found out
you guys existed.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.743
(chuckles)
And you are?

06:18.778 --> 06:21.012
Not allowed to let you inside,
but also

06:21.047 --> 06:23.581
extremely, incredibly
sorry about it.

06:23.616 --> 06:26.951
Well, Agent Morris,
inside of Bryant's house is

06:26.986 --> 06:28.553
a critical part
of our investigation

06:28.588 --> 06:29.921
into his kidnapping.

06:29.956 --> 06:31.823
Which is why you'll have
full access

06:31.858 --> 06:34.526
the millisecond we close ours.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.795
You know, we could
work together.
That would be amaze-balls.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.497
What do you guys have?

06:40.133 --> 06:42.901
Nothing. Which is why
we need to go inside.

06:44.737 --> 06:45.937
You owe us one.

06:45.972 --> 06:48.907
Rude. I literally
just met you and you.

06:48.942 --> 06:49.975
I don't owe squat.

06:50.010 --> 06:53.211
The FBI collectively owes us
for shooting our friend,

06:53.246 --> 06:55.013
Undersecretary of
Defense Duggan.

06:55.048 --> 06:58.817
Well, I'm still not
letting you inside.

06:58.852 --> 06:59.818
Then why don't
you tell us

06:59.853 --> 07:01.686
what you know?
To be honest,

07:01.721 --> 07:03.121
not much more than you do.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.889
There's been no ransom call,

07:04.924 --> 07:06.624
and Bryant has no
obvious enemies.

07:06.659 --> 07:08.626
If you ignore the
nine million vets

07:08.661 --> 07:10.462
trying to get help at the VA.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.797
The guy does seem
to be living the good life.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.499
Dude owns, like, 12 Brionis.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.569
How do you think
the vets would feel

07:17.604 --> 07:19.003
if they found out
the guy telling them no

07:19.038 --> 07:22.240
was walking around
in $7,000 suits?

07:22.275 --> 07:24.909
Brioni.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.144
How do you know
what that is?

07:26.179 --> 07:29.481
Well, I'm committed
to finding a value-mate,

07:29.516 --> 07:31.149
and I do my research.

07:34.220 --> 07:35.854
You sure you're okay?

07:35.889 --> 07:36.988
Yeah, yeah.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.624
Is this because I didn't
butter your muffin this morning?

07:39.659 --> 07:42.160
(chuckles)
No.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.161
Is this because
I made you listen

07:43.196 --> 07:45.063
to the Oprah story podcast
in the car again?

07:45.098 --> 07:46.798
Look, you and I both know
I love Oprah,

07:46.833 --> 07:48.199
and I love Phil Donahue,

07:48.234 --> 07:50.101
so I'm very conflicted
about that whole thing.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.803
Okay. So this is you
just being normal?

07:51.838 --> 07:53.872
Yeah, normal.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.507
So you have my ID,
my paperwork.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.509
Everything you could possibly
need from me.

07:57.544 --> 07:59.577
That's right.
But I still can't
see a doctor

07:59.612 --> 08:01.779
about the arthritis that's
keeping me up at night?
That's correct.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.716
Until I get
an initial assessment?
Correct.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.684
And the next available
appointment you have for one

08:06.719 --> 08:07.685
is eight weeks from now?

08:07.720 --> 08:09.854
Uh, 53 days,
to be exact.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.089
MAN:
Shame!

08:11.124 --> 08:13.024
That is unacceptable,

08:13.059 --> 08:14.826
inexcusable
and indefensible.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.094
Look at her.

08:16.129 --> 08:16.895
She sacrificed
for this country.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.964
Your job is to
thank her for it.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.767
I know, and... I'm sorry,
ma'am, is he with you?
No.

08:22.802 --> 08:23.935
But he took the words
right out of my mouth.

08:23.970 --> 08:24.936
Okay, sir, I'm sorry,

08:24.971 --> 08:27.105
but please, if you could
just take your place...

08:27.140 --> 08:29.707
No, ma'am, I'm sorry,
'cause I cannot do that.

08:29.742 --> 08:32.844
I want this woman seen
by a doctor today.

08:32.879 --> 08:35.847
In fact, I want every single
fine veteran waiting here

08:35.882 --> 08:38.016
seen by a doctor today.

08:38.051 --> 08:41.853
Now, that should cover it.
You make it happen.

08:41.888 --> 08:43.988
KENSI:
Excuse us, federal agents.
No, no, no, don't touch it.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.890
No-nobody touch it.
Can you help me with this?

08:45.925 --> 08:46.891
Stand back.
All right.
Federal agents.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.527
Stand back.
What the...

08:49.796 --> 08:52.831
Okay, that can't be good.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.644
Hey, Eric, I'm sending you
a surveillance photo.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.112
See if you can ID this guy.

09:08.147 --> 09:10.214
ERIC (over phone):
Why, you think he has something
to do with the case?

09:10.249 --> 09:11.081
Well, it's not every day

09:11.117 --> 09:12.049
that a VA administrator
gets kidnapped.

09:12.084 --> 09:14.686
Also, it's not every day
a veteran drops 50 K

09:14.721 --> 09:15.920
like it's nothing.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.188
And when those two days
are the same day...

09:17.223 --> 09:18.623
I'll let you know what I find.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.224
DEEKS:
Thanks. Eric.

09:20.259 --> 09:22.060
I'm not a monster.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.328
I don't like turning
veterans away.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.830
I'm a veteran myself,
but, you know,

09:25.865 --> 09:27.999
just like in the service,
you follow directives.

09:28.034 --> 09:30.068
Even when you think the ones
giving them are fools.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.070
Yeah, I understand that.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.905
What else can you tell us
about your boss, Bryant?

09:33.940 --> 09:35.873
Did you find him yet?

09:35.908 --> 09:37.275
No.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.344
Let's just say that part
of me hopes you don't.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.380
Bryant didn't come
here to fix things.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.049
If anything, he's benefitting
from all this endless red tape.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.183
How so?

09:46.219 --> 09:50.188
Okay, we've been tasked
with increasing patient intake

09:50.223 --> 09:53.091
while also reducing
wait times.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.959
All the records say that
we're meeting our goals,

09:54.994 --> 09:57.829
but I'm here to tell you
we're not even close.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.964
So you think
he's cooking the books?

09:59.999 --> 10:03.101
Yeah. And making
a nice bonus for himself,

10:03.136 --> 10:04.902
for a job well done.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.905
The, uh, the guy
that made the scene,

10:07.940 --> 10:09.907
has he been in here before?

10:09.942 --> 10:12.176
Uh, no.
I-I don't think so.

10:12.211 --> 10:15.279
All right. We have to speak
to a few more administrators,

10:15.314 --> 10:17.415
but if you think of anything,
please don't hesitate to call.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.750
Okay?

10:18.785 --> 10:20.351
Hey, I remember you.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.820
You were injured.

10:22.855 --> 10:24.288
You were in here.
(laughs softly)

10:24.323 --> 10:25.757
I'm glad to see you're better.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.859
Thanks.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.761
You know,
that's all we want here.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.029
To make people better.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.999
Just wouldn't think
it would be so hard.

10:36.035 --> 10:38.036
Thank you.

10:42.475 --> 10:46.310
So, our VA Robin Hood
is named Charles Langston

10:46.345 --> 10:48.312
and he roughly matches
the description

10:48.347 --> 10:49.814
of Bryant's kidnapper.

10:49.849 --> 10:52.050
I was hoping this wasn't
the work of a vet.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.085
And a highly decorated one
at that.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.420
Langston was a naval commander,

10:55.455 --> 10:57.455
he served three tours
in Vietnam.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.991
Discharged in '89,
and then worked

11:00.026 --> 11:01.926
in package delivery
for 20 years.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.327
CALLEN: There's not
a lot of money in that.

11:03.362 --> 11:05.163
50 grand was probably stolen.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.398
Hence my Robin Hood
reference.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.300
Uh-huh.
SAM: Bryant's doing pretty well

11:09.335 --> 11:10.434
for a civil servant;
his co-workers think

11:10.470 --> 11:14.038
he may have, uh, cooked
the books to line his pockets.

11:14.073 --> 11:17.375
So Langston kidnapped Bryant
'cause he's a corrupt official?

11:17.410 --> 11:19.043
Forced Bryant to withdraw
the dirty money,

11:19.078 --> 11:21.312
and use it for its original,
intended purpose.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.048
I'll look
into Bryant's bank accounts.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.917
Hey. So we just got permission

11:25.952 --> 11:28.086
to access
Bryant's Mercedes' GPS.

11:28.121 --> 11:31.189
It turns out, it's at the
Veterans Cemetery in the Valley.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.191
Kensi and Deeks
are on their way now.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.792
Eric, send me
Langston's address.

11:34.827 --> 11:36.060
Me and G'll go check it out.

11:36.095 --> 11:38.129
Maybe he'll talk
to another Navy man.

11:38.164 --> 11:39.931
Or a merry man.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.467
You do bear a striking
resemblance to Little John.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.270
Oh, thank you, Friar Tuck.

11:46.305 --> 11:47.972
Excuse me, Maid Marian.

11:48.007 --> 11:49.207
May I?
Yes, of course.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.075
(chuckles)

11:51.110 --> 11:53.010
I wouldn't take it personally.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.813
I mean, I always
fancied you more of an,

11:55.848 --> 11:59.083
I don't know, Alan-a-Dale,
the wandering minstrel.

11:59.118 --> 12:01.085
Because I play a mean lute.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.487
Because you play a mean lute.

12:02.522 --> 12:05.223
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.758
(exhales)

12:06.793 --> 12:08.793
Coco mango.

12:19.038 --> 12:21.005
(speed dialing)

12:21.040 --> 12:22.840
MAN (on phone):
Henrietta?

12:22.875 --> 12:25.843
Yeah. We've got
a situation here.

12:25.878 --> 12:27.846
MAN:
Wonderful.

12:35.955 --> 12:37.956
Clear.

12:42.161 --> 12:44.896
Clear.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.998
DEEKS: There's got to be
a reason to bring Bryant here,

12:47.033 --> 12:48.800
besides the obvious.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.568
KENSI: I don't think
he'd bring him here to kill him,

12:50.603 --> 12:54.172
I mean, it's a place where
you honor and respect veterans.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.174
Yeah, but remember our working
theory is that Langston believes

12:56.209 --> 12:59.277
that Bryant is doing
just the opposite.

13:01.848 --> 13:02.980
KENSI:
I got fresh prints.

13:03.015 --> 13:04.415
From Bel Air?

13:04.450 --> 13:06.350
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't just say that.

13:06.385 --> 13:07.552
It's probably for the best.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.886
It's going this direction.

13:08.921 --> 13:10.121
All right, you lead the way.

13:10.156 --> 13:11.322
KENSI:
It was kind of weird being back

13:11.357 --> 13:13.558
at the VA Hospital, huh?

13:13.593 --> 13:15.426
DEEKS:
Uh...

13:15.461 --> 13:16.994
Yeah, I don't, I don't know.

13:17.029 --> 13:18.396
I mean, are you... are you okay?

13:18.431 --> 13:21.899
Yeah. As long as I'm not going
in as a patient, I'm good.

13:21.934 --> 13:24.202
Yeah.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.070
Are you okay?

13:26.105 --> 13:27.572
What do you mean?

13:27.607 --> 13:30.174
Um, well...

13:30.209 --> 13:33.111
You have a lot
of memories from there, too.

13:35.281 --> 13:37.248
Probably more than me.
I was in that coma for weeks,

13:37.283 --> 13:40.117
but... you were awake
for all of it.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.220
(exhales)
Please, I'm good.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.856
You know, my part was...
my part was easy.

13:44.891 --> 13:47.425
I just showed up, ate the Jell-O

13:47.460 --> 13:49.060
and proposed to
a girl in a coma.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.862
Yeah, I'm serious.

13:52.231 --> 13:54.599
You were there for me
the entire time,

13:54.634 --> 13:56.434
and I wasn't there for you.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.936
I mean,
I couldn't be.

13:58.971 --> 14:01.906
BRYANT:
Help!

14:01.941 --> 14:03.941
The hell was that?

14:03.976 --> 14:04.976
Came from there.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.944
BRYANT: Help!

14:06.979 --> 14:08.980
Help!

14:11.050 --> 14:12.216
(panting)

14:12.251 --> 14:13.918
I can't... Help...

14:13.953 --> 14:16.087
(panting):
Help... Help...

14:16.122 --> 14:18.089
(shouting)
That probably hurts.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.968
Clear.

14:31.003 --> 14:33.137
Clear.

14:33.172 --> 14:36.073
Langston's doing a
little renovation?

14:36.108 --> 14:38.109
(chuckles)
He needs a new contractor.

14:38.144 --> 14:39.343
(clattering)

14:39.378 --> 14:40.478
That came from out back.

14:40.513 --> 14:41.646
There's a shed back there.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.928
SAM (over comms):
Okay, we're gonna go
on my three.

14:56.963 --> 14:59.263
One...

14:59.298 --> 15:01.432
two...

15:01.467 --> 15:03.000
three.
Drop it, junior.

15:03.035 --> 15:05.970
Admiral?

15:06.005 --> 15:07.538
Who's this?

15:07.573 --> 15:09.240
Admiral Bridges.
Retired, like me.

15:09.275 --> 15:10.374
Sterling,

15:10.409 --> 15:11.609
lower your weapon,
they're friendlies.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.444
He doesn't look too friendly.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.179
Both of you,
lower your damn weapons.

15:16.515 --> 15:19.150
You want to tell us
what the hell's going on here?

15:33.299 --> 15:35.166
Ah, Miss Jones.

15:35.201 --> 15:38.336
I come bearing the
gift of good news.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.237
Kensi and Deeks found Bryant.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.739
Paramedics
are en route,

15:41.774 --> 15:44.041
but he seems
relatively unscathed.

15:44.076 --> 15:45.676
And do we know

15:45.711 --> 15:48.245
if Langston did indeed
kidnap him?

15:48.280 --> 15:49.514
Not yet.

15:52.151 --> 15:54.151
And what about Langston?

15:54.186 --> 15:55.686
Have Mr. Callen
and Mr. Hanna

15:55.721 --> 15:57.655
been able to locate him?

15:57.690 --> 16:00.624
They have not, unfortunately.

16:00.659 --> 16:02.326
But...?

16:02.361 --> 16:06.764
But they did find
two other familiar faces.

16:06.799 --> 16:11.302
Oh, bugger.

16:11.337 --> 16:12.603
You two were on a walk.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.071
Well, I wouldn't
call it a "walk."

16:14.106 --> 16:15.473
"Walk" implies exercise, cardio.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.607
It was more of a stroll.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.209
We like the neighborhood.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.211
The folks that live
around here don't even

16:20.246 --> 16:21.512
like this neighborhood.

16:21.547 --> 16:24.382
And it's a total coincidence
that this stroll...

16:24.417 --> 16:25.049
SAM:
3,000 miles away

16:25.085 --> 16:26.784
from where you actually live.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.619
Went right past
the home of a man

16:28.654 --> 16:30.054
being investigated
by NCIS.

16:30.089 --> 16:31.722
So, we good?

16:31.757 --> 16:33.157
SAM: Well, we didn't
even get to the part

16:33.192 --> 16:34.792
where you drew
firearms on us.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.694
Oh, they were permitted.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.396
A.J., I think these jokers

16:38.431 --> 16:39.764
forget that the last
time you saw them,

16:39.799 --> 16:42.199
you saved their hides.

16:42.234 --> 16:43.300
This is the one
whose ex-girlfriend

16:43.335 --> 16:44.602
tried to kill Henrietta.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.103
Oh, yeah.

16:46.138 --> 16:47.471
I see what you mean.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.140
CHEGWIDDEN: So what
brings you gentlemen

16:49.175 --> 16:50.541
to this neck of the woods?

16:50.576 --> 16:52.810
You mentioned a case.
You pull anything good?

16:52.845 --> 16:54.111
We'll ask the questions.

16:54.146 --> 16:55.346
By all means.

16:55.381 --> 16:59.317
Just don't count on us
answering any of them.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.788
Ow. Just leave it.

17:03.823 --> 17:06.657
Is this the gentleman
who kidnapped you?

17:06.692 --> 17:07.691
Yeah, that's him.

17:07.726 --> 17:08.826
And no, I don't know why

17:08.861 --> 17:10.394
he came after me.

17:10.429 --> 17:12.163
You ever seen him before?
Maybe at the VA?

17:12.198 --> 17:14.198
You mean he really is a vet?

17:14.233 --> 17:16.434
(laughs) I
always assume

17:16.469 --> 17:19.370
that homeless people are lying
on their little cardboard signs.

17:19.405 --> 17:22.440
You know, "homeless
vet," "single mom,"

17:22.475 --> 17:24.175
"rare and incurable
blood disease."

17:24.210 --> 17:26.710
So you never came across him
in your capacity at the VA?

17:26.745 --> 17:28.512
Maybe, maybe not.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.214
Honestly, I can't keep track.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.849
Guy's probably just another vet
with psychological problems.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.351
The city's swarming
with them.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.620
Trust me.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.489
KENSI: Uh, just one
more question.

17:38.524 --> 17:40.391
Did he ask you for money,

17:40.426 --> 17:42.593
or want you
to make a withdrawal?

17:42.628 --> 17:44.495
Nope. Didn't even ask
for the cash I had on me,

17:44.530 --> 17:46.197
which is what I was expecting.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.199
These guys are always looking
for handouts.

17:48.234 --> 17:51.202
Well, Mr. Bryant,
this has been, um...

17:51.237 --> 17:54.205
What has this,
what has this been, Kensi?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.506
Eye-opening?

17:55.541 --> 17:57.441
It has been eye-opening.

17:57.476 --> 17:59.577
Anytime. Thank you.

17:59.612 --> 18:02.746
Okay. Yeah, um, sir.
Could you, um...

18:02.781 --> 18:04.515
I think he needs
his nose packed again,

18:04.550 --> 18:06.350
but really, like, get--
really-- get it in there.

18:06.385 --> 18:08.152
Okay? 'Cause it's...

18:08.187 --> 18:09.687
Actually, am I
allowed to leave now?

18:09.722 --> 18:10.788
(exhales)
Well, I, um... Oh.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.189
You wish.

18:12.224 --> 18:14.258
Oh, you think
you got FOMO?

18:14.293 --> 18:16.193
You don't even know FOMO.

18:16.228 --> 18:17.661
Robert Bryant,
you're under arrest.

18:17.696 --> 18:19.196
Guys, take him away.

18:19.231 --> 18:21.232
You want to tell me why?
Man up.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.300
We found
those "lost" patient records

18:23.335 --> 18:25.436
from the VA that you had stashed
at your house.

18:25.471 --> 18:27.171
KENSI: Ouch.
(Deeks whistles)

18:27.206 --> 18:29.607
Hi.
And you are?

18:29.642 --> 18:31.775
Special Agent Zoe Morris.
New face of the FBI.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.177
No, for reals.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.311
They're putting me
on the homepage

18:34.346 --> 18:35.913
and all the recruiting
pamphlets.

18:35.948 --> 18:40.718
Cool, nice to... meet you.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.520
CHEGWIDDEN: Calm
down, Sterling.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.921
I outrank you.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.723
A-And I bet
I can outrun you.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.791
And I've got a heck
of a lot more hair.

18:47.826 --> 18:48.926
CHEGWIDDEN: Sterling,
put away your weapon.

18:48.961 --> 18:49.927
He's young,

18:49.962 --> 18:51.395
he didn't mean to insult you.

18:51.430 --> 18:52.830
That's where you're wrong.

18:52.865 --> 18:53.664
Gentlemen.

18:53.699 --> 18:55.166
Hetty.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.200
Henrietta.

18:56.236 --> 19:00.371
Sterling, Mr. Hanna,
secure your damn weapons.

19:02.541 --> 19:05.409
Hetty, you want to tell Abbott
and Costello here to cooperate?

19:05.444 --> 19:07.278
And would you kindly tell
your lap dogs to leave us

19:07.313 --> 19:08.279
the hell alone?

19:08.314 --> 19:09.180
Go on.

19:11.450 --> 19:14.585
Henrietta, tell them.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.488
Unbelievable.

19:17.523 --> 19:18.956
You knew these two
would be here.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.926
Mr. Hanna,
these are strange times.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.562
How could I possibly know

19:24.597 --> 19:27.198
that we were all looking
for the same man?

19:35.608 --> 19:38.542
When the Vietnam War
was over, officially,

19:38.577 --> 19:41.812
some us stayed
in Southeast Asia, unofficially.

19:41.847 --> 19:45.349
When the military pulled out,
they pulled out fast.

19:45.384 --> 19:46.984
Left people behind.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.919
Operatives
with non-official covers.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.588
Our mission was to rescue them.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.723
HETTY:
But our government made clear

19:52.758 --> 19:54.458
that we were on our own.

19:54.493 --> 19:55.993
We had to come up
with all the money,

19:56.028 --> 19:58.596
for equipment,
fuel, bribes, ransom.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.731
Whatever was needed
to bring them home.

20:00.766 --> 20:04.468
And Langston was a part of
this, uh... motley crew?

20:04.503 --> 20:05.636
CHEGWIDDEN: Oh,
let's say the Stones.

20:05.671 --> 20:07.304
He was our
Mick Jagger.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.006
Oh, please, he
was Keith Richards.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.475
I thought I was Keith Richards.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.711
CHEGWIDDEN: So we finished
our mission, we came home,

20:13.746 --> 20:17.448
went our separate ways,
and then, a few weeks ago,

20:17.483 --> 20:19.783
Langston started acting strange.

20:19.818 --> 20:23.420
We were concerned, especially
when we found out he was sick.

20:23.455 --> 20:24.622
With a presumptive disease.

20:24.657 --> 20:25.423
Agent Orange?

20:25.458 --> 20:26.991
HETTY: First it
struck Granger.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.627
Now Langston.

20:29.662 --> 20:32.896
I'm sure the rest of
us will soon follow.

20:32.931 --> 20:35.733
Always a ray
of sunshine.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.901
DEEKS: So,
what is, uh,

20:37.936 --> 20:39.637
Langston's end game here?

20:39.672 --> 20:42.773
He kidnaps Bryant,
drops 50 K at the VA?

20:42.808 --> 20:44.308
Oh, I think he's settling
old scores.

20:44.343 --> 20:45.309
Shaming the government.

20:45.344 --> 20:46.610
Fighting for the disadvantaged.

20:46.645 --> 20:47.778
Normal bucket
list stuff.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.013
Then why tear
his house up?

20:49.048 --> 20:50.347
You think we did that?

20:50.382 --> 20:51.749
Well, if wasn't you,
then who was it?

20:51.784 --> 20:52.983
Add that to the list
of things we'll ask him

20:53.018 --> 20:53.984
as soon as
we find him.

20:54.019 --> 20:54.785
KENSI:
I'm sorry,

20:54.820 --> 20:56.687
can we just stop
for a second here?

20:56.722 --> 20:58.656
Did you say that Granger
was involved in this?

20:58.691 --> 21:00.958
He was one of the operatives
we stayed to recover.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.826
CALLEN:
Hetty,

21:02.861 --> 21:04.262
have you heard from him?

21:05.831 --> 21:06.897
Not yet.

21:06.932 --> 21:07.898
No one has.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.099
CHEGWIDDEN:
Come on, Henrietta,

21:09.134 --> 21:12.903
if he's not already dead,
we both know he will be soon.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.476
ERIC: Guys, a man matching
Langston's description

21:19.511 --> 21:21.512
just shot up a pawnshop
in Hollywood.

21:21.547 --> 21:23.047
Impossible.
Langston would never.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.581
CALLEN: He's done
a lot things today

21:24.616 --> 21:25.616
he's never done.

21:25.651 --> 21:27.685
Send us the address.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.686
HETTY:
Gentlemen, before you go,

21:28.721 --> 21:31.655
if you remember nothing else

21:31.690 --> 21:33.657
that we've told you,

21:33.692 --> 21:37.495
let it be that
Charles Langston is one of us.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.773
SAM: How the hell did
you guys beat us here?

21:49.808 --> 21:51.475
Well, he probably
used Waze.

21:51.510 --> 21:52.643
Oh, I used it,
all right.

21:52.678 --> 21:53.977
To know where the
sheep are headed.

21:54.012 --> 21:56.046
Most ridiculous concept
I've ever heard.

21:56.081 --> 21:57.715
Don't say it.

21:57.750 --> 21:58.849
(laughing):
What?

21:58.884 --> 22:00.451
You two have a
lot in common.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.422
They're with us.
Got it.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.658
Why don't you walk us
through what happened?

22:07.693 --> 22:09.960
The guy marches in here
demanding money.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.896
I tell him to get lost, he pulls
out a gun, shoots the place.

22:12.931 --> 22:14.365
Did he shoot at you?

22:14.400 --> 22:16.467
Well, not directly,
but look at the place.

22:16.502 --> 22:19.036
I literally didn't know where
he was gonna shoot next.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.504
And I swear to you,

22:20.539 --> 22:22.439
I only used my gun
to protect myself.

22:22.474 --> 22:23.707
We, uh, saw
the description

22:23.742 --> 22:26.777
you gave LAPD,
it's a tad vague.

22:26.812 --> 22:27.878
Care to elaborate?

22:27.913 --> 22:31.014
(sighs)
Uh... black,

22:31.049 --> 22:35.486
about 6'2", at
least 180 pounds,

22:35.521 --> 22:37.988
uh, wore a... a tan, uh, jacket

22:38.023 --> 22:40.023
with a bright
blue backpack.

22:40.058 --> 22:41.091
Could be anyone.

22:41.126 --> 22:42.893
This him?

22:42.928 --> 22:44.929
That's the guy, yes!

22:45.964 --> 22:47.664
Has he been in here before?

22:47.699 --> 22:48.799
Let me tell
you something,

22:48.834 --> 22:50.768
we have our share of crazies,

22:50.803 --> 22:52.936
drug addicts,

22:52.971 --> 22:54.004
conspiracy theorists,

22:54.039 --> 22:57.074
but I have never seen this
guy before in my life.

22:57.109 --> 22:58.075
MAN:
Yaniv,

22:58.110 --> 22:59.877
I am so sorry.

22:59.912 --> 23:01.545
I'm here.

23:01.580 --> 23:02.679
You his lawyer?

23:02.714 --> 23:04.415
Harry Zanetti. I...

23:04.450 --> 23:06.650
Could I talk with my client
for just a minute, please?

23:08.086 --> 23:09.086
Sure thing, Harry.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.155
SAM:
Excuse me, Harry.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.628
(sighs)
This is not working.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.565
This doesn't smell right.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.567
Why, 'cause he just
ID'd your friend?
(phone vibrates)

23:23.602 --> 23:24.668
You know, I have
a suggestion.

23:24.703 --> 23:26.703
Why don't you two head
back to the boatshed,
Yeah?

23:26.738 --> 23:28.705
take a step back from it
all, just to process.

23:28.740 --> 23:29.973
"Boatshed"?
"Process"?

23:30.008 --> 23:31.108
What kind of hippy-dippy...

23:31.143 --> 23:32.576
Lame...
disrespectful...

23:32.611 --> 23:35.446
BS are you feeding us?
Just a suggestion.

23:35.481 --> 23:37.014
Eric just finished scrubbing
the traffic cam video footage.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.849
Turns out your
friend Langston

23:38.884 --> 23:41.085
has actually been here
twice before today.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.022
That son of a bitch inside
is hiding something.

23:58.670 --> 24:01.805
SAM:
As you can see,
Langston's been in your shop,

24:01.840 --> 24:03.674
more than once.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.008
ZANETTI:
Where did you get this footage?

24:05.043 --> 24:06.109
Do you have a warrant?

24:06.144 --> 24:07.644
CALLEN:
We don't need a warrant.

24:07.679 --> 24:08.779
It's traffic
cam footage.

24:08.814 --> 24:11.181
Yaniv, we want
to catch this guy,

24:11.216 --> 24:14.017
make sure he doesn't try to hurt
you or anyone else.

24:14.052 --> 24:15.919
Yeah, and to do that,
we need access to

24:15.954 --> 24:17.087
your security cam
footage, your records.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.889
We got to find out
what he was pawning.

24:18.924 --> 24:19.890
What you need
is a warrant.

24:19.925 --> 24:22.526
Now, are you
charging my client

24:22.561 --> 24:23.527
with something?

24:23.562 --> 24:25.062
Just because, of course,
from where I'm standing,

24:25.097 --> 24:26.930
he's the victim.

24:26.965 --> 24:29.933
Is that why your client lied
about never having met this man?

24:29.968 --> 24:32.203
Agent Hanna, my client does
not work at the store 24/7.

24:33.839 --> 24:36.173
If this man actually entered
the shop, it must've happened

24:36.208 --> 24:37.875
at a time when my
client was absent.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.276
Simple as that.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.879
Now, my client
and I are going to

24:41.914 --> 24:43.914
walk out this door,
and I do not believe

24:43.949 --> 24:45.115
you are going to stop us.

24:51.690 --> 24:52.789
CHEGWIDDEN:
Okay, thanks.

24:52.824 --> 24:54.091
(scoffs)

24:54.126 --> 24:56.126
(door closes)

24:56.161 --> 24:58.962
Yeah. Appreciate it.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.899
Man, I didn't realize
kid gloves came in your size.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.734
You know what? We got
a better case against you two

25:03.769 --> 25:04.968
than we have against him.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.604
And you keep playing vigilante,
I'll put you in your place.

25:07.639 --> 25:08.805
That'll be the day.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.007
CHEGWIDDEN:
Don't mind Sterling.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.108
He just doesn't like retirement.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.243
So, you guys could use
some warrants?

25:13.278 --> 25:15.779
Yeah. Hey, Eric?
(digital beeps)

25:15.814 --> 25:18.048
See if you can get some
warrants to Yaniv's store

25:18.083 --> 25:19.983
for his security footage...

25:20.018 --> 25:21.184
His house, his car,
his financial records.

25:21.219 --> 25:23.053
Exactly.
How long will that take?

25:23.255 --> 25:24.288
I'm confused,

25:24.323 --> 25:25.589
the warrants just came in.

25:25.624 --> 25:27.090
You're all set.

25:27.125 --> 25:29.126
Wait, you didn't put in
the request?

25:30.862 --> 25:32.996
Not even Hetty works that fast.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.899
Don't look at me.
He's the damn lawyer.

25:35.934 --> 25:37.134
What can I say,
people like me.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.203
Hey, Admiral, what's up?

25:40.238 --> 25:41.805
We're still on for<i> Titanfall </i>
this weekend, right?

25:41.840 --> 25:44.742
I got this amazing recipe
for porcini...

25:49.181 --> 25:51.181
You two stay here.

25:51.216 --> 25:54.117
Don't touch anything,
and don't talk to anyone.

25:54.152 --> 25:55.953
Can we at least brew
some coffee?

25:58.090 --> 25:59.222
Here.

25:59.257 --> 26:01.625
Knock yourself out.

26:03.762 --> 26:04.728
I'm winning him over.

26:04.763 --> 26:06.630
(both chuckle)

26:08.100 --> 26:09.967
Callen, Sam, Kensi and Deeks
are on their way

26:10.002 --> 26:11.768
to the pawnshop
with a search warrant.

26:11.803 --> 26:13.604
SAM:
What about Thelma and Louise?

26:14.640 --> 26:17.808
Well, Admiral Chegwidden's
car is on the move.

26:17.843 --> 26:18.876
It's heading straight for you.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.311
ERIC: Why are we tracking
two retired admirals?

26:21.346 --> 26:23.246
They just helped us
with the warrants.

26:23.281 --> 26:25.349
CALLEN:
These guys have been running
around behind our backs all day.

26:25.384 --> 26:28.018
Now they want to help us?
I don't buy it.

26:28.053 --> 26:30.721
SAM: Hopefully they'll lead us
right to Langston.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.890
Well, here they come.

26:43.135 --> 26:45.802
Why don't we just ask Hetty
where they're going?

26:45.837 --> 26:47.771
Have you seen Hetty?

26:47.806 --> 26:49.640
No. Where is she?

26:52.077 --> 26:55.312
NELL:
Your guess is as good as mine.

27:04.022 --> 27:06.290
Oh, no.

27:13.031 --> 27:14.898
Look at that.

27:21.006 --> 27:24.007
Oh, dear.

27:24.042 --> 27:25.876
(bongos playing)

27:35.887 --> 27:38.656
Hey, babe? Deeks.

27:41.059 --> 27:42.259
Deeks!

27:42.294 --> 27:44.027
Sorry.

27:44.062 --> 27:46.930
I already sent
the security footage to Ops.

27:46.965 --> 27:48.331
Um, what did you find
around here?

27:48.366 --> 27:49.265
I found this,

27:49.301 --> 27:50.967
Oh.
that you can buy me
for my birthday,

27:51.002 --> 27:53.303
and I found something magical.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.172
Ready for this?

27:55.207 --> 27:57.374
So I know the boyfriends
are not supposed to weigh in

27:57.409 --> 27:59.042
on this sort of
thing, but I saw it,

27:59.077 --> 28:00.477
and I thought that you
would look, you know,

28:00.512 --> 28:02.713
absolutely beautiful
wearing it, so...

28:05.851 --> 28:07.884
(exhales)

28:07.919 --> 28:10.054
Um...

28:13.325 --> 28:16.994
That's really pretty,
it's beautiful.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.197
What just happened?

28:20.232 --> 28:22.232
Did I just say
something idiotic?

28:22.267 --> 28:24.468
No. No, I'm fine.

28:24.503 --> 28:26.470
What's going on?

28:26.505 --> 28:28.138
(sighs)

28:28.173 --> 28:30.073
Baby.

28:30.108 --> 28:32.109
Um...

28:35.113 --> 28:38.815
Since I lost my dad,
I was, um...

28:38.850 --> 28:41.852
I was hoping to ask Granger
to walk me down the aisle.

28:48.126 --> 28:49.359
Yeah.

28:51.329 --> 28:53.096
And he would've.

28:53.131 --> 28:54.832
He would've loved that.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.542
Um, if-if-if we're
done here,

29:05.577 --> 29:07.043
we should, we should probably
go to Yaniv's house.

29:07.078 --> 29:08.178
Are you done?

29:08.213 --> 29:10.214
Yeah.
Okay.

29:14.186 --> 29:16.553
ERIC:
Here's Langston
coming in this morning,

29:16.588 --> 29:18.488
guns a-blazing.

29:18.523 --> 29:21.324
Huh. Seems to corroborate
Yaniv's story.

29:21.359 --> 29:22.793
Ah, but...

29:22.828 --> 29:25.896
Let us travel back in time
24 hours, shall we?

29:29.601 --> 29:31.434
There's Yaniv.

29:31.469 --> 29:33.970
Maybe he forgot
Langston's face?

29:34.005 --> 29:36.006
Like those people sitting
in traffic this morning?

29:36.041 --> 29:37.274
That's what I thought,

29:37.309 --> 29:40.877
but clearly Yaniv is taken with
whatever Langston is pawning.

29:40.912 --> 29:42.813
Huh.

29:42.848 --> 29:44.915
Well, whatever's
in that bag has to be worth

29:44.950 --> 29:47.584
at least the 50K
Langston brought to the VA.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.554
And obviously,
something worth killing over.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.790
(exhales)

29:57.295 --> 30:00.163
Looks like they stopped
around the next corner.

30:00.198 --> 30:02.199
Make the turn, pull over.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.139
That's their SUV.

30:20.452 --> 30:21.952
They're just sitting there.

30:22.954 --> 30:24.554
SAM:
<i> Maybe they got lost.</i>

30:24.589 --> 30:27.191
You remember the first time
we met Granger?

30:29.327 --> 30:31.394
How could I not?

30:31.429 --> 30:33.096
You drew on him and
knocked him to the ground.

30:33.131 --> 30:34.331
Well, I thought
he had kidnapped Hetty

30:34.366 --> 30:36.499
and rigged the entire boatshed
with explosives.

30:36.534 --> 30:38.535
We all did.

30:40.538 --> 30:42.873
Granger was a sly fox.

30:42.908 --> 30:44.040
Yeah.

30:44.075 --> 30:46.209
Remind you of anyone?

30:46.244 --> 30:48.445
These guys couldn't hold
a candle to Granger.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.982
They don't have his skill,
they don't have his cunning

30:52.017 --> 30:54.051
and they don't have
his dry sense of humor.

30:56.121 --> 30:59.222
CALLEN:
Hold on.

30:59.257 --> 31:01.191
What the...?

31:02.227 --> 31:04.194
You fellas lost?

31:04.229 --> 31:05.595
(clears throat)

31:05.630 --> 31:06.963
How the hell
did you make us?

31:06.998 --> 31:09.966
Simple. I got eyes, son.
(laughs)

31:10.001 --> 31:11.234
(tires screeching)

31:11.269 --> 31:15.105
What was that you were saying
about them not having any skill?

31:16.141 --> 31:18.241
Maybe Granger taught them
a few things.

31:18.276 --> 31:20.243
Yeah.
All right?

31:20.278 --> 31:22.880
Then they learned from the best.
(chuckles)

31:26.384 --> 31:28.352
(doorbell rings)

31:31.556 --> 31:33.590
Hi. I'm Marty Deeks, LAPD.

31:33.625 --> 31:36.159
This is Special Agent
Kensi Blye, NCIS.

31:36.194 --> 31:37.494
We're here to talk to Yaniv.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.396
ASAP.

31:39.431 --> 31:40.597
Yaniv is not home.

31:40.632 --> 31:44.301
That doesn't really matter
because we have a search warrant

31:44.336 --> 31:46.503
for this very...

31:46.538 --> 31:47.671
very large house.

31:47.706 --> 31:48.805
Wow, I'm just noticing now

31:48.841 --> 31:51.274
how massive this house is.
KENSI: Yeah, you know what?

31:51.309 --> 31:53.009
We should, we should probably
get some extra agents out here.

31:53.044 --> 31:55.345
What do you think?
We're probably gonna need,
like, 12,

31:55.380 --> 31:57.447
which is too bad 'cause
we had dinner plans tonight.

31:57.482 --> 31:59.616
Just... wait here.

31:59.651 --> 32:04.054
Yeah, I, um, think
we'll wait inside. Thanks.

32:05.056 --> 32:07.124
(whistles)

32:10.295 --> 32:12.296
I will be right back.

32:13.698 --> 32:15.732
So, dinner?
What do you want to do?

32:15.767 --> 32:16.866
You want to cook or what?

32:16.902 --> 32:18.601
I mean, I could cook, but
I'm just spitballing here,

32:18.636 --> 32:19.636
maybe-maybe you could cook?

32:19.671 --> 32:21.571
(laughs) I don't cook.
You know that.

32:21.606 --> 32:23.340
Sure you do. You made
cookies for Christmas.

32:23.375 --> 32:24.541
I thought that would
be like a catalyst

32:24.576 --> 32:26.443
for a whole new
culinary Kensi.
Right.

32:26.478 --> 32:27.511
First of all, that's not
cooking, that's baking,

32:27.546 --> 32:29.179
and second of all, what,
you want cookies for dinner?

32:29.214 --> 32:30.080
Sure, I love
cookies for dinner.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.115
Okay, fine, I'll make
cookies for dinner.

32:32.150 --> 32:33.383
Great, we're having
cookies for dinner.
Mm-hmm.

32:33.418 --> 32:34.617
Yaniv!

32:34.652 --> 32:36.252
This is taking too long.

32:36.287 --> 32:37.721
Hello?

32:37.756 --> 32:41.124
We're coming in. We got
that search warrant

32:41.159 --> 32:44.394
to your very,
very, large house.

32:44.429 --> 32:47.431
Evidently paid for
with pawnshop money.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.235
Oh, there you are.

32:52.270 --> 32:53.136
Did Yaniv get lost?

32:53.171 --> 32:54.738
I understand it's
a really big house.

32:54.773 --> 32:56.272
Gun!

32:56.307 --> 32:58.308
(shouts)

32:58.343 --> 33:00.677
Guns, plural!
(gunshots)

33:16.795 --> 33:18.094
You happy?

33:18.129 --> 33:19.396
You finally got me
in the kitchen.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.264
Uh... (grunts)

33:33.311 --> 33:35.312
(gunshots)

33:36.648 --> 33:37.614
We're on the scene.

33:37.649 --> 33:38.548
What's Kensi
and Deeks' location?

33:38.584 --> 33:40.450
ERIC: They're pinned down
in the kitchen.

33:42.620 --> 33:44.821
Almost out, you?
Same.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.557
Pretty soon I'm gonna be
throwing pots and pans.

33:47.592 --> 33:49.326
G, G.

33:50.562 --> 33:51.828
You got to be kidding me.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.229
(gunshots continue)

33:53.264 --> 33:55.198
Looks like you
need some help.

33:55.233 --> 33:57.367
Turn around
and drive out of here now.

33:58.636 --> 34:00.237
Shooter's on the balcony.

34:05.243 --> 34:07.744
If you still want us to leave,
I'm gonna need your keys.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.479
That's definitely
not happening.

34:09.514 --> 34:10.647
CALLEN:
You want to help us?

34:10.682 --> 34:11.748
Give us some cover.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.083
You got it.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.253
Go!

34:25.563 --> 34:27.531
Drop your weapon!

34:28.800 --> 34:30.767
Kens, Deeks, you okay?

34:30.802 --> 34:31.802
KENSI:
Yeah, I'm out.

34:32.837 --> 34:34.704
Here you go.

34:40.845 --> 34:41.811
Set?

34:41.846 --> 34:44.414
One, two, three.

34:47.552 --> 34:49.786
Yo!

34:49.821 --> 34:51.654
Good?

34:51.689 --> 34:52.889
Clear.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.591
What the hell is
happening out there?

34:54.626 --> 34:55.592
You said there
were two of them!

34:55.627 --> 34:57.127
There are more now.

34:57.162 --> 34:59.295
We need to leave.

34:59.330 --> 35:01.831
(grunts)

35:01.866 --> 35:03.666
You're gonna slow us down.

35:03.701 --> 35:05.502
(gunshot)
(groans)

35:05.537 --> 35:07.304
We got what we need. Kill him.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.175
Federal agents.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.846
Yaniv!

35:18.483 --> 35:21.151
Langston, Langston.

35:21.186 --> 35:22.418
How did he open that door?

35:22.453 --> 35:23.520
LANGSTON:
I don't know.

35:23.555 --> 35:24.654
I didn't see.

35:24.689 --> 35:25.722
SAM:
You okay, buddy?

35:25.757 --> 35:26.790
Hang in there, all right?

35:29.394 --> 35:30.894
SAM:
Deeks,
get Langston out of here.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.262
KENSI: I'm on it.
I got it, I got it.

35:32.297 --> 35:34.664
SAM:
All right. Okay.

35:38.703 --> 35:40.937
KENSI:
All right. You're okay.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.639
DEEKS:
You got him?
KENSI:
I got him, I got him.

35:42.674 --> 35:45.341
You good?
I'm gonna secure the house.

35:45.376 --> 35:46.709
KENSI:
Yeah, go, go, go.

35:46.744 --> 35:47.777
Let's get you out of here.

35:55.887 --> 36:00.456
Eric, Yaniv escaped on a road
south of his property.

36:00.491 --> 36:03.193
Find him.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.199
BRIDGES:
Well, if the bullets didn't
get him, the fall sure did.

36:11.536 --> 36:13.537
(groans softly)

36:21.346 --> 36:23.213
Charles, you look like hell.

36:23.248 --> 36:26.549
A.J. Sterling.

36:26.584 --> 36:27.884
They got my key.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.519
What key?

36:32.523 --> 36:33.924
You two hard of hearing?
What key?

36:37.829 --> 36:39.629
(sighs)

36:39.664 --> 36:41.464
We're gonna need a ride.

36:41.499 --> 36:44.868
Come on, you get shotgun.

36:59.951 --> 37:02.519
It's over here.

37:08.793 --> 37:10.794
(grunts)

37:13.564 --> 37:14.864
You keep yours on a keychain?

37:14.899 --> 37:15.966
It's a key.

37:17.468 --> 37:20.336
Unbelievable.
All yours, A.J.

37:20.371 --> 37:22.305
You guys want
to see something cool?
Yeah.

37:31.382 --> 37:32.749
(chuckles)

37:32.784 --> 37:35.018
I want all of it.

37:35.053 --> 37:37.320
This is impressive.

37:37.355 --> 37:39.555
BRIDGES: Thought you
might appreciate it.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.491
Oh, no, no.

37:42.527 --> 37:44.694
Oh, damn it.

37:44.729 --> 37:47.764
Well, that's unfortunate.

37:47.799 --> 37:48.999
What's the problem?

37:50.034 --> 37:52.635
Might as well.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.537
Remember how I said

37:54.572 --> 37:56.306
we had to raise
all the money

37:56.341 --> 37:57.974
for our mission
in Southeast Asia?

37:58.009 --> 37:59.976
Kind of inspired a bit of
creativity on our part.

38:00.011 --> 38:02.045
We got creative as hell.

38:02.080 --> 38:06.649
We managed to rescue Granger
and all the other operatives

38:06.684 --> 38:09.652
without spending one damn dime
of that ransom money, but...

38:09.687 --> 38:11.988
that left us
with another problem.

38:12.023 --> 38:13.423
Yeah. What to do
with all that money.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.325
BRIDGES:
It's almost 40 years later

38:15.360 --> 38:16.793
and we're still trying
to figure that out.

38:16.828 --> 38:19.062
The idea was
to use it for good,

38:19.097 --> 38:21.698
but that's easier said
than done.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.600
Okay, so what's so hard about
that? Just donate the money.

38:24.635 --> 38:27.537
(footsteps)
HETTY:
It wasn't money, Mr. Hanna.

38:28.573 --> 38:30.807
It was gold.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.542
$1 million worth

38:32.577 --> 38:35.611
when we came home in 1978.

38:35.646 --> 38:39.115
Today, those gold bars
are worth a cool $40 million.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.550
(whistles)

38:40.585 --> 38:41.818
LANGSTON:
Minus the one I sold

38:41.853 --> 38:44.454
to Yaniv.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.523
Mm, and I'm assuming
he has it all now.

38:47.525 --> 38:49.659
Once we were stateside,
I was in charge of it.

38:49.694 --> 38:52.762
Kept it here in this
electronic safe.

38:52.797 --> 38:54.030
SAM:
Okay, so...

38:54.065 --> 38:55.832
how did Yaniv know where it was?

38:55.867 --> 38:58.768
His goons didn't beat
it out of you, right?

38:58.803 --> 39:00.036
Of course not.

39:00.071 --> 39:01.070
HETTY:
They didn't have to.

39:01.105 --> 39:04.674
Did they?

39:07.979 --> 39:11.881
I found that
at your house, Charles.

39:11.916 --> 39:15.819
There was a little cubby
behind it, empty.

39:16.821 --> 39:18.788
I kept a journal in there.

39:19.824 --> 39:22.559
It had this
container's location.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.695
And the code to the safe.

39:25.730 --> 39:27.029
Damn it, Charles.

39:27.064 --> 39:28.865
You know better than
to write things down.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.401
Man, I don't know
what I know anymore.

39:31.436 --> 39:32.535
I had to write it down.

39:32.570 --> 39:34.971
I keep losing things,

39:35.006 --> 39:36.939
names, faces.

39:36.974 --> 39:39.509
Is it my condition, my age?

39:39.544 --> 39:43.079
I sold that gold bar because
I just wanted to do some good

39:43.114 --> 39:45.715
in the time I have left.

39:49.987 --> 39:53.456
Let's go get that gold.
