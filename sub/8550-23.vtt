15:06.006 --> 15:08.208
FUNKY HUNK, YOU START.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.477
THIS IS KIND OF
A TOUGH CHOICE, PAT.

15:10.543 --> 15:14.447
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THESE ARE ALL
PRIME-CHOICE BABES,

15:14.514 --> 15:18.185
BUT I THINK I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO GO WITH TANYA

15:18.251 --> 15:22.022
BECAUSE HER PARENTS
ARE HARDLY EVER HOME.

15:23.156 --> 15:26.226
TANYA, IF YOU
PICKED EDDIE,

15:26.293 --> 15:29.196
YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY
TO HAWAII.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.097
DARN!

15:30.163 --> 15:31.864
I PICKED WALDO.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.267
[AUDIENCE MOANS]

15:34.334 --> 15:36.936
WELL, WALDO,
WHO DID YOU PICK?

15:37.004 --> 15:40.407
IT WAS A REAL
BRAIN SQUEEZER,

15:40.473 --> 15:42.209
BUT I CHOSE...

15:42.275 --> 15:44.411
NICOLE.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.214
NICOLE, IF YOU
PICKED WALDO,

15:47.280 --> 15:50.450
YOU'LL BE WINGING YOUR WAY
TO THE ALOHA STATE.

15:50.517 --> 15:51.551
SORRY.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.086
I PICKED EDDIE.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.055
[AUDIENCE MOANS]

15:55.122 --> 15:57.124
HEY, NICOLE. IT'S COOL.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.392
WE COULD STILL GO OUT.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.760
WITHOUT HAWAII?

16:00.827 --> 16:03.130
FORGET IT, HUNKY FUNK.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.134
OW. OW. OW.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.936
WELL, STEVE,
IT'S UP TO YOU.

16:10.003 --> 16:12.439
IF THE DUDETTE YOU CHOSE
ALSO CHOSE YOU,

16:12.505 --> 16:15.275
YOU'LL HAVE
THE LUAU OF YOUR LIFE.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.678
WELL, THESE
CHICKAROONIES ARE ALL,

16:18.745 --> 16:23.483
AS THEY SAY
IN FRANCE, "HOT."

16:23.550 --> 16:28.821
BUT THE BABE
WHO RINGS MY CHIMES
IS ONEISHA.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.923
ONEISHA...

16:30.990 --> 16:33.226
WHO DID YOU CHOOSE?

16:34.827 --> 16:36.329
I CHOSE...

16:36.396 --> 16:37.464
STEVE!

16:41.834 --> 16:44.604
CONGRATULATIONS!

16:44.671 --> 16:45.638
[URKEL]
QUIET!

16:45.705 --> 16:48.575
STOP!

16:48.641 --> 16:50.177
STOP!

16:51.144 --> 16:54.581
OH, NO, STOP! STOP!

16:54.647 --> 16:58.751
ONEISHA, I HAVE MADE
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.387
I CAN'T
GO OUT WITH YOU.

17:00.453 --> 17:03.256
FOR MY HEART
BELONGS TO ANOTHER WOMAN.

17:03.323 --> 17:06.959
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS
AFTER WE GET BACK?

17:07.026 --> 17:09.596
EVERY FIBER
OF MY VERY BEING

17:09.662 --> 17:12.632
BELONGS TO THE LOVELY
LAURA WINSLOW.

17:17.204 --> 17:20.140
FROM THE VERY FIRST TIME
I SAW LAURA,

17:20.207 --> 17:22.475
I VOWED I WOULD
NEVER STRAY,

17:22.542 --> 17:25.145
AND I SHAN'T.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.013
EVERY BREATH I TAKE,

17:27.080 --> 17:29.015
EVERY THOUGHT I THINK,

17:29.082 --> 17:31.584
SPELLS L-A-U-R-A.

17:31.651 --> 17:32.719
STEVE, STEVE.

17:32.785 --> 17:36.689
- WE'RE ON THE AIR.
- NO, I HAVE TO DO THIS!

17:37.624 --> 17:39.058
I'M HERS.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.093
MY HEART,

17:40.160 --> 17:41.894
MY SOUL,

17:41.961 --> 17:44.697
EVERYTHING I AM
OR EVER WILL BE

17:44.764 --> 17:47.534
BELONGS TO HER.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.437
I'M COMING HOME
TO YOU, BABY.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.843
YOUR URK-MAN
IS COMING HOME.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.261
HOWDY, LOVE DROPS.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.566
I WAS HOPING
YOU'D STILL BE UP.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.269
DID YOU HAPPEN
TO CATCH DUDES TONIGHT?

18:27.174 --> 18:29.942
I CAUGHT IT.

18:30.009 --> 18:33.513
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE SKIP
THE LIGHT FANDANGO,

18:33.580 --> 18:35.482
HITCH OUR WAGON
TO A STAR,

18:35.548 --> 18:38.685
AND GO STEADY.

18:38.751 --> 18:41.321
YOU SEE THIS, STEVE?

18:41.388 --> 18:45.057
ALL THAT'S MISSING
IS...YOUR NECK.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.327
I MAY BE WAY
OFF BASE HERE,

18:47.394 --> 18:49.162
BUT YOU SEEM UPSET.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.298
A LITTLE
POSTNASAL DRIP?

18:52.732 --> 18:56.869
STEVE, YOU HUMILIATED ME
ON TELEVISION.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.838
I DID?

18:58.905 --> 19:01.308
WHY DID YOU GO
ON DUDES ANYWAY?

19:01.374 --> 19:05.178
I THOUGHT YOU
AGREED IT WAS SEXIST
AND CHAUVINISTIC.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.314
I THOUGHT IF YOU
SAW OTHER WOMEN--

19:07.380 --> 19:09.216
HOT, CURVACEOUS,
SEXY WOMEN--

19:09.282 --> 19:10.817
FAWNING ALL OVER ME,

19:10.883 --> 19:12.051
YOU MIGHT GET JEALOUS

19:12.118 --> 19:14.854
AND DO A LITTLE
FAWNING YOURSELF.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.258
STEVE, WHEN WILL YOU REALIZE

19:18.325 --> 19:20.092
I'LL NEVER FEEL
THE WAY ABOUT YOU

19:20.159 --> 19:21.428
THAT YOU
FEEL ABOUT ME?

19:21.494 --> 19:23.896
OH, YES, YOU WILL.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.467
AND IT'S MY VISION
OF THAT GLORIOUS MOMENT

19:27.534 --> 19:29.436
THAT KEEPS MY
LITTLE HEART BEATING.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.239
BA-BOOM. BA-BOOM.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.873
'BA-BOOM.'

19:33.940 --> 19:37.210
OH, IS SHE SMILING AT ME? YES,
SHE IS.

19:37.277 --> 19:40.347
BA-BOOM BA-BOOM
BA-BOOM BA-BOOM

19:40.413 --> 19:42.215
BA-BOOM BA-BOOM
BA-BOOM BA-BOOM
BA-BOOM BA-BOOM.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.717
I'M SORRY, STEVE,
BUT YOU'VE GOT A LONG WAIT.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.654
WELL, I WOULDN'T WAIT
TOO LONG, BABYKINS.

19:47.720 --> 19:51.057
AFTER ALL,
I'M A SUPER DUDE.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.826
THAT'S DUD, STEVE.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.995
OH, YEAH?

19:56.062 --> 19:57.630
WELL...

19:59.966 --> 20:01.934
THIS DUD'S FOR YOU.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.636
AHH!

20:21.153 --> 20:22.822
CARL?

20:23.956 --> 20:25.425
CARL!

20:35.101 --> 20:36.469
YEAH?

20:36.536 --> 20:39.238
HAPPY BIRTHDAY,

20:40.273 --> 20:42.642
OH, GEE,
THANKS, HONEY.

20:43.310 --> 20:46.245
THIS IS, UH...SWELL.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.816
WAIT--WAIT A MINUTE!

20:49.882 --> 20:50.850
MAKE A WISH.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.652
OH, RIGHT.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.623
DID YOUR WISH
COME TRUE?

20:56.689 --> 20:58.391
WELL, NO.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.494
WHAT'S
THE MATTER, CARL?

21:03.095 --> 21:05.398
WELL...SWEETHEART...

21:05.465 --> 21:06.866
REMEMBER WHEN I SAID

21:06.933 --> 21:09.502
I DIDN'T WANT A BIG FUSS
FOR MY BIRTHDAY?

21:09.569 --> 21:11.003
YES.

21:11.070 --> 21:14.006
WELL, I FIBBED.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.808
I DID WANT A BIG FUSS.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.845
REALLY? THEN WHY DID
YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T?

21:18.911 --> 21:23.383
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SAY,
"OH, HONEY, DON'T BE SILLY.

21:23.450 --> 21:27.053
WE'LL MAKE A BIG FUSS
BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU."

21:27.119 --> 21:29.689
THEN I WOULD
HAVE CAVED IN.

21:31.524 --> 21:34.260
NEXT YEAR, BIG FUSS!

21:34.327 --> 21:36.996
BIG, BIG FUSS!

21:37.063 --> 21:39.432
HOLD ON.
I FORGOT SOMETHING.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.838
SURPRISE!
SURPRISE!
SURPRISE!

21:45.905 --> 21:48.341
OH, YOU GUYS!

21:48.408 --> 21:50.042
