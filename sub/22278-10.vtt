00:06.267 --> 00:08.600
NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero,

00:08.633 --> 00:10.533
Mother Nature
goes in for the kill.

00:10.567 --> 00:13.433
CHIP: There's a thousand ways
to die out here
in your own special way.

00:13.467 --> 00:16.133
NARRATOR:
Chip searches the tundra
for his missing family.

00:16.167 --> 00:18.667
People get lost.
Just disappear.

00:18.700 --> 00:21.667
Andy's dog team
is put to the test.

00:21.700 --> 00:23.467
ANDY: Looks like
the ice is caving in.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.800
NARRATOR: Glenn braces
for danger on the horizon.

00:25.833 --> 00:27.200
And the bears are just about

00:27.233 --> 00:28.267
to come out
of hibernation now.

00:29.900 --> 00:32.333
And Sue
braves thin ice for water.

00:32.367 --> 00:34.300
But holding off could cost me
my life this time.

00:59.067 --> 01:00.300
(CHUCKLES)

01:00.333 --> 01:02.067
Yeah. Weather's changing.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.233
I gotta get my butt
doing my chores.

01:04.267 --> 01:06.633
Normally this time of year
I'm shovelling snow,

01:06.667 --> 01:08.667
putting it in a bucket in here
so it can melt out.

01:08.700 --> 01:11.667
So I can do my laundry,
my cooking, whatever.

01:11.700 --> 01:14.867
But the shovelling
and twisting is gonna tear
my spine apart again.

01:15.667 --> 01:18.133
So, today
I'm gonna grab the Argo,

01:18.167 --> 01:19.800
and I'm gonna go upriver.

01:19.833 --> 01:23.233
It usually have an open lead
up that way
where the spring is.

01:23.267 --> 01:26.967
If I can get up there
and fill even a few jugs,
that's liquid water.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.467
Immediate liquid water.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.433
With less damage to my body.

01:30.467 --> 01:31.967
With this storm
coming in now,

01:32.000 --> 01:33.800
I wanna get going
and get back.

01:33.833 --> 01:36.667
The one thing
you must do is capitalise

01:36.700 --> 01:39.533
on each scrap of
good weather you get.

01:43.467 --> 01:44.800
Are you ready, Ermine?

01:44.833 --> 01:45.867
And we're off.

01:52.367 --> 01:55.400
NARRATOR: With the river
nearly frozen solid
in many places,

01:55.433 --> 01:58.433
finding liquid water
is no easy task.

01:58.467 --> 02:00.533
I know some of the spots
on my river.

02:00.567 --> 02:03.667
I know where some of
the really deep holes are.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.633
I'm looking for
that green colour.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.633
Which tells me
there's liquid water

02:07.667 --> 02:10.333
closer to the surface,
but I don't know
until I get there.

02:10.367 --> 02:12.267
I'll never know
how deep the hole is.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.400
Until you're on top of it,
there's no way to tell.

02:14.433 --> 02:15.800
I mean, you might sink,

02:15.833 --> 02:17.767
and that'd be a big,
fat bummer.

02:24.067 --> 02:26.000
This is kind of crazy.

02:26.033 --> 02:28.367
The rivers
will never freeze
all the way to the bottom.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.300
There's always
some water trickling.

02:30.333 --> 02:33.133
What does that do?
It puts pressure
on the ice sheet.

02:34.033 --> 02:35.167
It causes a pressure ridge.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.267
This is like
a pressure mountain.

02:38.300 --> 02:42.133
I mean, that's an unreal
amount of water under there.

02:42.167 --> 02:43.433
(MIMICKING EXPLOSION)

02:43.467 --> 02:45.767
When the pressure
gets to be too much,
it overflows.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.500
I'm not interested in
breaking that
pressure ridge up.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.533
Yeah. Looks like
my weather is coming in too,

02:52.567 --> 02:54.600
so I'm gonna
keep looking for a little bit.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.100
Hopefully find it.
If I can't find

02:56.133 --> 02:57.733
an open source upstream,

02:57.767 --> 02:58.900
I'll head downstream.

02:58.933 --> 03:00.667
I really need
to get some water.

03:03.700 --> 03:08.500
GLENN: In the Arctic
you have to have shelter
to survive.

03:08.533 --> 03:11.333
Because a human
is just not adapted
to the environment.

03:13.233 --> 03:14.533
If I went and bed
in the snow out there,

03:14.567 --> 03:15.800
I'd probably freeze to death.

03:25.133 --> 03:27.533
This is where I live.
This is my shelter.

03:27.567 --> 03:29.733
And I depend on it
for my survival.

03:29.767 --> 03:31.667
This is all bear damage.

03:31.700 --> 03:34.933
And the bears are
just about to come out
of hibernation now.

03:34.967 --> 03:36.400
And they'll start
coming down here.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.400
If a bear came in here
and pushed the wood stove over

03:38.433 --> 03:41.533
when I was gone,
you know, it could
catch the place on fire.

03:41.567 --> 03:44.400
It's important to have a plan.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.467
If you have to abandon ship,
you need a lifeboat.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.933
NARRATOR: Living hundreds
of miles from civilisation,

03:56.967 --> 03:58.700
Glenn has nobody
to call on for help

03:58.733 --> 04:01.067
if his cabin
is destroyed by bears.

04:02.133 --> 04:03.667
This is a sod house.

04:03.700 --> 04:07.900
It's made from a frame of
spruce poles, covered in sod.

04:07.933 --> 04:11.267
Today, I'm gonna fix it up
in case I have to use it
in an emergency.

04:11.300 --> 04:15.100
These barrels here
are where I store things
I need to survive

04:15.133 --> 04:17.967
if I had to come in here
and use it as
an emergency shelter.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.433
In here I got a sleeping bag,
I got some food.

04:21.467 --> 04:24.867
Way to start a fire,
all the basics
I need to survive.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.900
But if I had to
come in here right now
and spend the night,

04:26.933 --> 04:28.100
it would be pretty miserable.

04:28.133 --> 04:30.400
This is my wood stove.

04:30.433 --> 04:32.767
Pretty well buried
in the snowdrift here.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.533
So I have to
get all this snow out of here.

04:35.933 --> 04:37.500
So I can
start working on the floor.

04:49.300 --> 04:50.433
I got most of the snow out.

04:51.533 --> 04:52.967
Got the stove all cleaned off.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.967
I wanna cover the whole floor
with a nice
spruce bough carpet.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.333
It'll be warmer to sleep on
if I had to.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.933
I'm looking for
not just any spruce bough.

05:03.967 --> 05:06.333
So here's a nice,
little spruce branch.

05:06.367 --> 05:10.033
Because it's
two-dimensional, flat.

05:10.067 --> 05:14.467
And it's kind of
spread out wide,
so it'll cover a good area.

05:14.500 --> 05:19.067
A spruce branch
is different on the top
than it is on the bottom.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.800
When I put them
down on the floor,

05:20.833 --> 05:23.533
I want the bottom side of
the branch faced up.

05:23.567 --> 05:26.267
It's much softer
and more comfortable.

05:26.300 --> 05:27.900
I want a nice
smooth carpet.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.000
I just find it
a lot more enjoyable

05:32.033 --> 05:34.900
to go out here in the forest
because I like nature.

05:34.933 --> 05:37.567
And I like
being connected to it
every day.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.400
There's a lot
about self-sufficiency too,
and independence.

05:40.433 --> 05:43.933
Just being able to
get what you need
right from nature.

05:43.967 --> 05:46.367
I just enjoy this
better than shopping
at the carpet store.

05:49.967 --> 05:53.867
ANDY: This is not the
"Henry Thoreau
on Walden Pond" lifestyle

05:53.900 --> 05:55.000
that people think it is.

05:55.033 --> 05:57.567
It's nothing but work,
work, work, work.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.300
And if you don't know
how to plan

05:59.333 --> 06:00.633
and have good logistics,

06:01.567 --> 06:02.833
you won't make it up here.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.700
Living out here
the way we live,

06:09.733 --> 06:11.500
we've chosen to
go with dogs

06:11.533 --> 06:14.433
-for our transportation,
our work.
-(DOGS BARKING)

06:14.467 --> 06:17.500
So they're a big part
of our world out here.

06:17.533 --> 06:21.600
For me, lead dogs
are critical to the process.

06:22.667 --> 06:25.500
Iceberg is my main leader.

06:25.533 --> 06:29.167
He's kind of what
I'm hoping I can model
these other dogs after.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.800
He's eight years old
right now.

06:30.833 --> 06:32.967
So I figure I probably have
at least two more

06:33.000 --> 06:35.100
really good,
solid years with him.

06:35.133 --> 06:38.500
You're a good boy.
Do you wanna go
for a run again, huh?

06:38.533 --> 06:40.267
KATE: They all have
their own personality.

06:40.300 --> 06:43.133
And they'll do things
their own way.

06:43.167 --> 06:46.200
But we just need to
have faith in them

06:46.233 --> 06:47.833
to do what they're told.

06:47.867 --> 06:49.467
And take us
where we need to go.

06:52.533 --> 06:56.200
ANDY: Everything that I do
out here revolves around
dogs and dog mushing.

06:58.067 --> 07:01.000
You have to constantly train
new lead dogs.

07:02.267 --> 07:04.867
Identify young dogs that
might have potential.

07:06.133 --> 07:09.200
So that when the old guys
need to be retired,

07:09.233 --> 07:12.767
you have dogs that are
already ready to step into
that position

07:12.800 --> 07:14.800
rather than having to
start from scratch.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.933
I wanna run
Jack and Iceberg together
for a little bit.

07:21.967 --> 07:24.200
And we'll just see
what they do together.

07:24.233 --> 07:26.667
And then if Jack looks like
he's kind of wanting to do it,

07:26.700 --> 07:30.733
I'm gonna take Iceberg out
and put Jack
up ahead by himself.

07:30.767 --> 07:33.367
Well, we gotta remember,
he's only 18 months old.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.000
Yup. No, he's all right.

07:35.033 --> 07:36.800
KATE: He's still a baby.

07:36.833 --> 07:39.900
ANDY: Jack's showing
a lot of maturity
for a dog his age.

07:39.933 --> 07:42.600
He's showing
a tremendous amount of
promise right now.

07:42.633 --> 07:45.100
So I'm pretty excited
about working with him.

07:45.133 --> 07:48.000
Today I'm gonna be testing
his confidence level

07:48.033 --> 07:49.133
to take commands.

07:49.167 --> 07:52.233
Either "gee" or "haw",
"right" or "left", or "whoa".

07:52.267 --> 07:54.700
The only way
I'm really gonna
get Jack going is

07:54.733 --> 07:58.467
he's gonna have to run
next to an experienced dog
like Iceberg.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.067
These dogs
learn from each other

08:00.100 --> 08:02.200
much better than
I can teach them.

08:02.233 --> 08:03.933
Okay, Iceberg. Straight ahead.

08:03.967 --> 08:06.667
Little haw, little haw,
little haw, little haw.

08:06.700 --> 08:09.033
Jack is only 18 months old.

08:09.067 --> 08:12.467
So we don't have
a lot of faith in
Jack getting it right.

08:12.500 --> 08:18.800
Gee, gee. Gee, gee.
Gee, gee. Gee! Gee!

08:18.833 --> 08:21.167
CHIP: It makes everything
sweeter when you can just
go out and be

08:21.200 --> 08:22.533
relying on yourself.

08:22.567 --> 08:24.933
When you go out there,
and you come back
time after time.

08:24.967 --> 08:28.067
And after a pile of years
goes by, you're still here.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.833
Figure,
"Yeah, I did things right."

08:34.300 --> 08:36.333
(DOGS BARKING)

08:40.733 --> 08:44.367
Chip's going out hunting
this morning, and he's...

08:44.400 --> 08:45.800
Our boy is gonna be

08:45.833 --> 08:47.100
coming up from Selawik.

08:47.133 --> 08:49.467
And he's gonna be
joining his dad on the hunt.

08:50.333 --> 08:52.033
We're running low on caribou.

08:52.067 --> 08:54.000
So it's time for these guys

08:54.033 --> 08:56.200
to go out and go do a hunt.

08:56.233 --> 08:59.467
NARRATOR:
Chip and Agnes' son, Jon,
is travelling 45 miles

08:59.500 --> 09:02.867
across the frozen tundra
to join the hunt.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.200
CHIP:
My son will bring a rifle.

09:04.233 --> 09:06.067
He'll do the shooting,
leaving a trail
of destruction.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.833
I'll be following his trail,
and skinning,
and gutting behind him.

09:08.867 --> 09:11.067
And working with him
is just simply me and him

09:11.100 --> 09:12.167
working together.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.533
Just like two good hunters
ought to.

09:14.233 --> 09:16.000
And it's a good team effort.

09:16.033 --> 09:18.733
Jon should be in here
in the next little bit.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.500
I wonder
where you plan on going?

09:20.533 --> 09:22.100
CHIP: They say these hills
all the way up to
Long Mountain

09:22.133 --> 09:24.467
are the place to be.
There's already people there.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.533
I guess these guys
have been getting
real fat ones down there.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.367
So that's all good news to me.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.767
You're just gonna take
the main trail
what we usually take?

09:30.800 --> 09:32.833
-Yup.
-Okay.

09:32.867 --> 09:34.000
I know where you'll be.

09:35.267 --> 09:36.400
Well, time is ticking,

09:36.433 --> 09:37.867
and the boy is not here yet.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.167
They should be here,
pulling up.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.067
Just keep getting ready.
He'll show up.

09:47.300 --> 09:51.467
NARRATOR: With 50 mile
an hour winds and temperatures
hitting 40 below zero,

09:51.500 --> 09:54.433
travelling in the Arctic
can be life-threatening.

09:54.467 --> 09:57.367
Between the villages
lies nothing
but desolate tundra,

09:57.400 --> 10:00.167
where cell phones
and radios are useless.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.033
I think Jon's about
three hours overdue.

10:02.067 --> 10:03.900
He should've
been here already.

10:03.933 --> 10:07.767
I think he was having issues
with his engine yesterday, so.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.633
Hope he doesn't have
engine issues today.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.267
It's just
so cold out there today.

10:11.300 --> 10:13.000
The thing is that
the wind is supposed to
pick up tonight.

10:13.033 --> 10:14.433
And that's what
worries me. So...

10:14.467 --> 10:16.900
I'd like to get out to
where we're gonna hunt caribou

10:16.933 --> 10:18.933
-and get that
as much as we can.
-Yeah.

10:18.967 --> 10:20.500
I just called Selawik. Um...

10:25.500 --> 10:27.267
So if she's with him,

10:27.300 --> 10:29.300
we better step this one
up a notch or two.

10:30.267 --> 10:31.600
Avery is
Jon's oldest daughter.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.333
She turned
four years old yesterday.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.133
This definitely
changes things a little bit.

10:36.167 --> 10:38.633
I'd really worry
if they've crashed.

10:38.667 --> 10:40.700
And if they've crashed, well,
that's a whole different deal.

10:41.967 --> 10:44.633
I'm gonna go around town,
and see if he didn't stop

10:45.733 --> 10:47.200
at Elwood's or somewhere.

10:47.233 --> 10:49.933
And if he's not here
by the time I've looked
around town for him...

10:49.967 --> 10:51.267
Then I'll
ride down that trail.

10:51.300 --> 10:52.700
I don't know why
he'd go somewhere else though.

10:52.733 --> 10:54.367
He should just
drive right straight here.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.933
No panic yet.

10:56.967 --> 10:58.433
I'm gonna go around town.
I'll see you in a bit.

10:59.433 --> 11:00.733
Maybe he stopped somewhere,

11:00.767 --> 11:02.867
and for some unknown reason
didn't say anything.

11:02.900 --> 11:05.033
That wouldn't be him at all,
but, um...

11:05.067 --> 11:06.533
Better to double check.

11:06.567 --> 11:09.233
AGNES: It worries me
a lot, you know.

11:09.267 --> 11:11.633
If something happens to them
while they're out there,

11:11.667 --> 11:14.033
and I just don't know
what's going on out there.

11:14.067 --> 11:17.133
But I try not to
worry too much.

11:17.167 --> 11:18.967
We don't like to
go that route. (CHUCKLES)

11:22.100 --> 11:25.400
CHIP: There's no place
for panic over something
you have no knowledge of.

11:25.433 --> 11:26.733
We don't know
what's going on out there.

11:27.367 --> 11:28.500
So, we gotta go see.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.767
What's up, Joe?

11:32.800 --> 11:34.333
JOE: Working on this
snow machine.

11:34.367 --> 11:36.200
-You haven't seen Jon,
have you?
-Nope!

11:36.233 --> 11:38.033
Yeah. Jon took off
at 6:00 this morning.

11:38.067 --> 11:39.100
He's supposed to be here

11:39.133 --> 11:40.967
by 8:00 or 9:00, all right?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.967
If he's not here by noon,
I'm gonna go take off,

11:43.000 --> 11:44.933
but I'm just looking
around town for him.

11:46.433 --> 11:48.700
He's somewhere
between here and there
if he's not around here.

11:48.733 --> 11:50.367
'Cause he's not in Selawik.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.767
Anyway, if he stops here
just let him know
we're starting to wonder.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.300
-All right.
-Tell him to
call the hell home,

11:54.333 --> 11:55.533
or just go straight there.

11:55.567 --> 11:56.733
-I'd be happy.
-Yeah.

11:56.767 --> 11:58.533
-All right, bro.
I'll catch you later.
-Yeah.

12:01.067 --> 12:03.767
CHIP: Well, I went to where
Jon would stop around town,

12:03.800 --> 12:05.633
and I don't see
his SnoGo anywhere.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.333
After four hours
of being overdue,

12:07.367 --> 12:09.133
if he's not
at the house right now,

12:09.167 --> 12:10.833
then it's pretty close
to time for me

12:10.867 --> 12:13.600
to go down the trail
and just have a look for him.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.967
ANDY: When you're working
with dogs, you only get
out of them

12:21.000 --> 12:22.433
what you put into them.

12:22.467 --> 12:24.900
If you don't put
the time and energy
into training them,

12:24.933 --> 12:26.767
you're not gonna
get a lot out of that dog.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.433
(BARKING)

12:40.533 --> 12:41.667
Straight ahead.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.467
NARRATOR: Andy needs
new lead dogs

12:43.500 --> 12:46.200
if he is to maintain
an effective dog team.

12:46.233 --> 12:49.633
18-month-old Jack
is training alongside
veteran Iceberg.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.067
Straight ahead. On by.

12:53.300 --> 12:56.300
Jack did pretty good
with Iceberg.

12:56.333 --> 12:58.233
This is only the second time
he's run up front,

12:58.267 --> 13:02.400
but he was kind of trying
to follow the different tracks
that he had already done.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.533
So that's a good sign.

13:03.567 --> 13:04.900
So I think
what I'm gonna do is

13:04.933 --> 13:07.433
just put him on
one of these tracks,

13:07.467 --> 13:09.900
and we'll see
what he does by himself.

13:09.933 --> 13:11.567
Jack, go haw, haw, haw...

13:11.600 --> 13:13.033
This is just
the beginning training

13:13.067 --> 13:15.300
to get them used to
the words of left and right.

13:15.333 --> 13:16.367
For left is haw.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.867
Gee is right.

13:17.900 --> 13:18.967
Haw, haw.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.100
Oh, yeah. Good boy.
That was good.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.833
Good, gee. Gee.

13:22.867 --> 13:24.833
Gee, gee, gee, gee.

13:24.867 --> 13:26.767
Oh, you're doing it.
Gee, gee, gee.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.000
Good boy. Gee, gee.

13:28.033 --> 13:29.767
We raised him
as a sole puppy.

13:29.800 --> 13:33.000
So he's really tuned into me.
And I found over the years

13:33.033 --> 13:35.400
that's one
of the better things
you can do

13:35.433 --> 13:37.067
to really get a good lead dog.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.733
Gee, gee.

13:39.900 --> 13:40.967
Jack, go gee.

13:42.100 --> 13:43.100
Jack, go gee.

13:44.267 --> 13:45.267
Everybody stay.

13:45.933 --> 13:46.933
Everybody stay.

13:49.867 --> 13:52.133
Jack, gee, gee. That's gee.

13:52.167 --> 13:53.533
Good boy. Good boy.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.433
Okay. Jack, go haw.

13:57.133 --> 13:59.433
Haw, haw. (CHUCKLES)

13:59.467 --> 14:01.367
Iceberg and Topaz
are doing it for him.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.600
(ANDY AND KATE LAUGHING)

14:03.200 --> 14:04.433
Good boy, Jack!

14:04.467 --> 14:07.500
The fact that Jack
was running out front
by himself

14:07.533 --> 14:10.067
and keeping the line
tight with motivation

14:10.100 --> 14:12.433
was a really,
really good sign.

14:12.467 --> 14:14.767
He really doesn't know
his gee-haw commands.

14:14.800 --> 14:18.933
The two leaders behind him
were kind of steering him.

14:18.967 --> 14:21.267
But what was really good is
he was picking up on

14:21.300 --> 14:23.100
which direction
they were going.

14:23.133 --> 14:24.400
You're doing really good.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.700
Yeah. You're not quite sure,

14:26.733 --> 14:28.267
but you're gonna
figure it out.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.400
The big thing that
really made me happy today is

14:30.433 --> 14:33.567
that he's just out
running by himself
without looking back.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.100
Huh? That's not a bad start.

14:36.133 --> 14:38.100
KATE: I think Jack's gonna
do well in time,

14:38.133 --> 14:40.933
but I think it's gonna take
a lot of patience.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.433
Come here, Jack.

14:42.467 --> 14:45.067
He's pretty happy
with himself. Aren't you?

14:45.100 --> 14:47.400
Huh? You're pretty happy.
You did a good job.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.933
SUE: As I get older,
the things that
weren't challenging

14:53.967 --> 14:56.000
are a pain in the ass now.

14:56.033 --> 14:58.833
But my personality
thrives on the challenge.

15:11.233 --> 15:13.767
NARRATOR: Despite the threat
of an Arctic storm,

15:13.800 --> 15:18.500
Sue takes her search for
fresh water
deep into the tundra.

15:18.533 --> 15:20.300
SUE: The colour is looking
really good up ahead.

15:20.333 --> 15:21.967
It's a lot of green.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.533
I can't tell whether it's
the snow blowing or
the steam rising from water,

15:25.567 --> 15:28.000
but I'm betting bottom dollar
I see some water up ahead.

15:28.667 --> 15:29.700
(ENGINE STARTING)

15:46.900 --> 15:49.767
Yeah. This is the colour
I'm looking for,
that green colour.

15:49.800 --> 15:53.067
I definitely see water,
but I have no idea

15:53.100 --> 15:56.100
whether it's, you know,
soft, fresh overflow,

15:56.133 --> 15:57.800
or refroze over it.

15:57.833 --> 16:01.900
This may seem like
a whole lot of effort
for a little bit of water.

16:01.933 --> 16:09.500
But for me to melt snow
for this amount of water
is three, four days of work.

16:09.533 --> 16:12.333
You know, so this,
if I can get
enough liquid water,

16:14.567 --> 16:15.900
that'd be cool beans.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.300
I really don't know
the substructure.

16:20.333 --> 16:24.700
I've got some deep,
deep sections of
the Kavik up this way.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.567
Um, but I wanna just
get at the edge,

16:26.600 --> 16:29.100
move a few pieces of the ice.

16:29.133 --> 16:33.033
And get to where I can get
enough water
to start filling these.

16:33.067 --> 16:36.433
You know, I've broken
through the ice before,
and it's dangerous.

16:36.467 --> 16:38.567
You don't have
a way to get dry,

16:38.600 --> 16:40.000
you're gonna
start losing body parts.

16:41.533 --> 16:42.900
So I'm cautious.

16:42.933 --> 16:45.233
I live by myself.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.900
If I go through the ice,
I'm dead.

16:56.667 --> 16:57.667
One done.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.067
One to go.

17:00.100 --> 17:04.233
In the lower world,
all you gotta do is,
"Oh, I'm thirsty."

17:04.267 --> 17:07.500
Flip the tap,
and you put your finger

17:07.533 --> 17:08.733
under it for five minutes

17:08.767 --> 17:09.833
till it's the
right temperature

17:09.867 --> 17:11.167
for whatever you wanna do.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.333
And I don't have that luxury.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.233
This is gold.

17:15.267 --> 17:17.067
This is liquid gold to me.

17:18.633 --> 17:21.533
It's another resource
that I'm able to tap into

17:21.567 --> 17:24.233
that normally I wouldn't.

17:24.267 --> 17:25.867
I wouldn't be able to
get this liquid water

17:25.900 --> 17:27.300
without a hell
of a lot of effort.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.267
Okay. That one's full.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.400
(SNIFFLES)

17:39.533 --> 17:40.533
Success.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.100
Now I just have to
get it home.

17:51.567 --> 17:55.367
I basically go for nine months
without running water.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.567
And I set aside
almost 300 gallons.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.467
So I'm rationing
a gallon a day
for all of my needs.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.367
Drinking water, washing water,
cooking water, everything.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.900
Yay! Success!

18:09.867 --> 18:13.900
And so to be able to go
with relatively few problems

18:13.933 --> 18:17.767
and get liquid water,
now I have more freedom
to do more.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.800
Yeah. It's a nice luxury.

18:19.833 --> 18:23.133
Takes a little work to get it,
but anything worth getting
takes a little work.

18:26.033 --> 18:27.367
GLENN: Space is different
out here.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.067
There's a lot of space.

18:29.100 --> 18:31.033
There's no
boundary lines out here

18:31.067 --> 18:33.033
that I have to worry about.

18:33.067 --> 18:34.967
You could walk as far as
your legs will carry you

18:35.000 --> 18:36.200
in any direction.

18:48.867 --> 18:49.867
Okay.

18:50.767 --> 18:53.400
So I've got five piles now.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.600
Now the trick is

18:54.633 --> 18:56.133
just to get them back
to the sod house.

18:57.267 --> 18:59.500
NARRATOR: For Glenn,
insulating his sod house

18:59.533 --> 19:02.833
is imperative to surviving
a worst-case scenario
in the bush.

19:06.700 --> 19:09.233
I do have a problem.
This string is not
strong enough.

19:09.267 --> 19:12.667
I think I may have a problem
because this is
the same kind of string

19:12.700 --> 19:14.733
that I used
on my head strap,

19:14.767 --> 19:17.933
and it's breaking
just tying it together.

19:17.967 --> 19:21.100
So how am I gonna carry it?

19:21.133 --> 19:26.667
So my head strap
is gonna be here,
and these two pieces of string

19:26.700 --> 19:31.433
may or may not support
the weight of
the spruce boughs.

19:33.967 --> 19:35.400
(GRUNTS) Oh.

19:35.867 --> 19:36.967
Okay.

19:42.033 --> 19:43.433
Let's see if
I can make it to camp.

19:53.333 --> 19:54.533
Whoa!

19:54.567 --> 19:55.567
(GRUNTS)

19:56.300 --> 19:58.300
String broke right here.

19:58.333 --> 20:00.267
I should've made the string
out of caribou hide.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.033
I was in a hurry.

20:02.067 --> 20:03.967
Used this
store-bought stuff.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.300
Big mistake.

20:05.333 --> 20:07.600
I'm gonna have to braid
a few of these together

20:07.633 --> 20:09.600
to make
a stronger cord next time,

20:09.633 --> 20:11.833
but I'm almost back
to the sod house.

20:11.867 --> 20:14.000
So, for now I'll just tie it
back together and keep going.

20:20.767 --> 20:22.667
Got the first load of
spruce boughs back.

20:23.367 --> 20:24.567
I got four more to get.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.600
Before I go get them
I'm gonna braid this string

20:26.633 --> 20:29.567
with three strands to make it
strong enough that
it doesn't break next time.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.767
CHIP: There's a lot of ways
that things can go
wrong out here.

20:36.367 --> 20:37.833
Everybody could be dead.

20:37.867 --> 20:39.833
That's the worst thing that
you could possibly
have happen.

20:53.067 --> 20:55.700
NARRATOR:
Chip and Agnes' son, Jon,
has gone missing,

20:55.733 --> 20:58.667
failing to arrive
from a trip across the tundra.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.133
CHIP: Yeah. He probably
left at 6:00 in the morning,

21:00.167 --> 21:01.233
and now it's noon.

21:01.267 --> 21:04.700
So, it's time to go find him.

21:04.733 --> 21:06.200
'Cause it should've took him
a couple hours,

21:06.233 --> 21:07.633
and that gives him
four hours of fudge.

21:07.667 --> 21:08.767
He's not here.

21:08.800 --> 21:09.933
Right here, Selawik.

21:10.767 --> 21:12.233
Right here, Noorvik.

21:12.267 --> 21:14.033
This distance between here
is probably,

21:14.067 --> 21:15.633
I'd say, 40-some odd miles.

21:16.633 --> 21:17.967
So he's in here somewhere.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.267
He's not at Selawik,
and he's not at Noorvik.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.067
So I'm just gonna
ride down the trail,

21:22.100 --> 21:23.800
and see
if I can bump into him.

21:23.833 --> 21:24.967
See how well it goes.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
It's just cold. Very cold.

21:27.033 --> 21:29.367
What he's gotta do is
make sure that
he stays out of the wind.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.700
The time to panic is if
I go from Noorvik to Selawik,

21:31.733 --> 21:33.867
and he's at neither place.

21:33.900 --> 21:35.700
Then we re-evaluate
what's going on,

21:35.733 --> 21:37.733
and we get some help.

21:37.767 --> 21:39.667
You're gonna come back
before it gets dark, right?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.067
Of course.

21:42.900 --> 21:44.600
I still got
a few hours of daylight.

21:44.633 --> 21:46.133
It gets a little scary,

21:46.167 --> 21:48.200
and I get worried
once in a while, you know,

21:48.233 --> 21:51.067
especially with
the conditions

21:51.100 --> 21:52.667
of the weather and the wind.

21:52.700 --> 21:55.067
But, uh, I always
try to think,

21:55.100 --> 21:56.967
"Hey, man, we teach them
how to dress proper.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.300
"And he knows what to do."

21:58.333 --> 22:02.233
So, he's aware of the dangers
that could happen out there.

22:02.267 --> 22:04.133
That's what comforts me.

22:04.167 --> 22:06.167
-Thank you. See you.
-See you later.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.667
-I'll be back in a bit.
-Yup. Good luck.

22:17.900 --> 22:19.967
CHIP: You know,
we're not on
a road system here.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.733
We don't have Triple A.

22:21.767 --> 22:23.267
We don't have police
coming down the road.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.933
We don't have tow services
we could call.

22:25.967 --> 22:27.300
When we're doing
something like this,

22:27.333 --> 22:29.100
first we cover
where they're at,

22:29.133 --> 22:30.900
we cover where
they're expected to be,

22:30.933 --> 22:32.733
and then we cover
the in-between.

22:32.767 --> 22:35.400
And if you start
getting all worked up
and worried,

22:35.433 --> 22:37.767
if you start to panic,
then you're not gonna
do things right.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.133
You're not gonna help anybody.
You're just gonna
add to the disaster.

22:42.567 --> 22:44.267
If we don't see him
by the time
we get to his home,

22:44.300 --> 22:47.367
and he's not home,
then we talk to
some more people about it,

22:47.400 --> 22:49.800
and more people look,
and have more
eyeballs out there.

NARRATOR: With temperatures
plummeting, Chip has
got to repair his snow machine

23:28.233 --> 23:31.100
and get back on the trail
to find his son
and granddaughter.

23:34.100 --> 23:37.267
My machine has been
idling quite a bit,
because it's been deeply cold.

23:37.300 --> 23:40.067
And when it's really cold
you have to
warm your machines up.

23:40.100 --> 23:42.100
But it also plugs,
fouls the plugs.

23:42.133 --> 23:43.567
'Cause they're starting
at a low temperature,

23:43.600 --> 23:45.533
and it just kind of
adds to the trouble,

23:45.567 --> 23:48.867
but I'm hoping to
bump into my son.

23:48.900 --> 23:50.367
After four hours
of being late,

23:50.400 --> 23:52.033
he's been
six hours on the trail,

23:52.067 --> 23:53.133
and he's got
his daughter with him.

23:59.900 --> 24:01.733
I don't know.

24:01.767 --> 24:03.400
I'll go all the way to
Selawik if I have to.

24:10.300 --> 24:11.300

24:24.267 --> 24:26.900
Very common things up here
are snow machine crashes.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.700
Another thing people do is
get lost.

24:28.733 --> 24:31.433
Or they go through the ice,
and they're never seen again.

24:32.333 --> 24:33.367
People just disappear.

24:39.233 --> 24:40.967

24:52.500 --> 24:54.200
-Overheating, huh?
And your belt's skipping?
-Yeah.

24:54.233 --> 24:56.400
Yeah. My belt is skipping
from my secondary clutch,

24:56.433 --> 24:57.900
and I was overheating.

24:57.933 --> 25:00.933
When I pulled up to Jon
and he had snow
packed all around his engine,

25:00.967 --> 25:03.200
and in a glance
that just tells me
he's overheating.

25:03.233 --> 25:06.000
And what you end up doing is
driving until your red light
comes on

25:06.033 --> 25:07.333
and says that
you got a high temp,

25:07.367 --> 25:09.333
and you stop
and you take your plugs out,

25:09.367 --> 25:11.467
and that's what
he's been doing
the whole way here.

25:11.500 --> 25:13.533
Well, I heard that
you took off out of Selawik,

25:13.567 --> 25:15.400
so I figured
after so many hours,

25:15.433 --> 25:16.667
I'm just gonna go have a look.

25:16.700 --> 25:18.400
-Yeah.
-And when I knew
Avery was with you

25:18.433 --> 25:20.733
then I really wanted to
go have a look.

cools down to go?

-Okay.

I was just cooling off.

-How are you, baby girl?
-JON: Tired.

GLENN: A human is wholly
dependent on their shelter,

26:10.100 --> 26:11.600
and the technology
that they use

26:11.633 --> 26:13.467
to keep themselves
alive out here.

26:14.567 --> 26:16.433
In the modern world,
people are losing

26:16.467 --> 26:18.533
their independence rapidly.

26:27.300 --> 26:28.367
I got the boughs in here.

26:29.933 --> 26:32.333
And it looks like
a good quantity
to get started.

26:32.367 --> 26:33.900
I think it's gonna
cover the floor.

26:33.933 --> 26:35.467
The floor is just dirt.

26:35.500 --> 26:39.933
It's very cold and hard,
so I'm gonna cover it
with spruce boughs

26:39.967 --> 26:42.567
because it makes
a much more
comfortable floor covering.

26:43.033 --> 26:44.400
It's warmer.

26:44.433 --> 26:47.133
I don't want
these sharp needles
sticking into my feet.

26:47.167 --> 26:48.733
I like to
walk around barefoot.

26:48.767 --> 26:52.433
If I set it like this,
the twig sticks up,
the sharp needles stick up.

26:52.467 --> 26:54.367
If I set it like this,

26:54.400 --> 26:56.167
you see how
it's much smoother,

26:56.200 --> 26:59.433
and the twig
where I broke it faces down.

26:59.467 --> 27:00.767
There's a lot
of stuff to learn.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.967
Which is why I like
living this way.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.567
But, you know,
I learned it.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.800
People that were experienced
in this way of life
taught me that,

27:07.833 --> 27:09.933
"Okay, this is the way
you make
a spruce bough floor."

27:09.967 --> 27:12.567
The first time I did one,
a Cree Indian
up in Northern Quebec

27:12.600 --> 27:13.600
showed me how to do it.

27:14.733 --> 27:17.200
These spruce boughs
are very flammable.

27:17.233 --> 27:19.733
If they were to catch on fire,

27:19.767 --> 27:22.000
obviously that would be
a very dangerous situation.

27:22.033 --> 27:24.833
So I'm gonna put some logs
just to hold them back.

27:24.867 --> 27:27.267
If I'm sleeping in here,
in the night I don't wanna

27:27.300 --> 27:29.433
push a few spruce boughs over
and hit the stove.

27:35.467 --> 27:36.467
Yeah. That's pretty good.

27:38.267 --> 27:39.900
Cool.

27:39.933 --> 27:41.933
Got the place all spruced up.

27:41.967 --> 27:45.333
I just need to put down
a few caribou hides,

27:45.367 --> 27:48.567
and a door,
and I'll light a fire
to test it out.

27:50.100 --> 27:53.067
Caribou hides
are a very good insulator.

27:53.100 --> 27:56.667
On top of the spruce boughs
it will make it
more comfortable and warmer.

27:58.367 --> 28:00.500
This caribou hide
will make a good door.

28:06.467 --> 28:08.000
That'll keep the breeze out.

28:09.233 --> 28:10.367
Shouldn't have
any more problems

out of my other stove.

and use it as a shelter,

28:36.867 --> 28:39.233

I got it all fixed up.

29:26.867 --> 29:28.167
We noticed this
as a puppy that

she was one of the most

29:29.333 --> 29:30.800

we've ever had.

29:32.133 --> 29:35.467
ANDY: So the goal today
for me is gonna
take Topaz out,

29:35.500 --> 29:37.533
run her in front
of a bigger team,

29:37.567 --> 29:40.233
and take her someplace
we haven't gone this year,

29:40.267 --> 29:43.500
and see how she performs
in that environment.

29:43.533 --> 29:46.133
And get her to run over
some bad ice,

29:46.167 --> 29:51.067
or maybe even
through a little bit of
shallow water on command.

something for the future.

29:55.533 --> 29:56.567
Come on, let's go!

30:01.100 --> 30:04.000
I think most people
see a dog team
run down the trail,

30:04.033 --> 30:07.233
and they think it's like
starting a car up
and stepping on the gas,

30:07.267 --> 30:08.667
but it's nothing like that.

30:08.700 --> 30:10.600
There's an incredible amount
of nuances

30:10.633 --> 30:12.633
to every single member
of the team.

30:12.667 --> 30:15.200
That a girl, Top.
You're doing a good job, girl.

30:15.233 --> 30:19.033
She's definitely got
the running down the trail
with a tight line.

30:19.067 --> 30:20.967
She's got the confidence
to be up front.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.333
She's quite happy
and proud of herself
to be up there.

30:24.367 --> 30:27.400
But she needs
exposure and experience.

30:27.433 --> 30:29.100
It's one thing to
go on a broken trail

30:29.133 --> 30:32.267
made by a snow machine
or a former dog trail.

30:32.733 --> 30:34.267
Good boys!

30:34.300 --> 30:38.067
It's another thing
to go into an environment
where there's no trail broken,

30:38.100 --> 30:40.767
the dogs are
up to their bellies
or their chest in snow,

30:40.800 --> 30:43.500
and actually push
through that
and break that trail.

30:44.633 --> 30:46.467
Attaboys. Easy.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.767
Whoa! Haw. Haw, haw.

We're gonna try
and cross, okay?

31:06.167 --> 31:07.833
You stay right here.
Everybody stay.

31:12.333 --> 31:15.633
Looks like this is
a little dicey right here.

31:15.667 --> 31:18.367
This part of the trail,
it looks like
the ice is caving in.

31:18.400 --> 31:19.733
(HOLLOW THUD)

31:20.867 --> 31:22.567
Hopefully it'll hold us up.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.800
She's not gonna like
going over thin ice.

31:24.833 --> 31:26.600
They can hear
that hollow sound.

31:26.633 --> 31:30.433
-They can hear this
when they come up on it,
-(HOLLOW THUD)

31:30.467 --> 31:32.000
and she's gonna see
this open water,

31:32.033 --> 31:34.867
and she may not wanna
cross here, so.

31:34.900 --> 31:37.233
The big test right now
for Topaz is to see

31:37.267 --> 31:40.267
if she can get past
her instincts

31:40.300 --> 31:43.100
and listen to
what I'm asking her
to do right here.

31:46.300 --> 31:47.467
You ready to
get your feet wet?

31:50.067 --> 31:52.467
Tighten up. Haw, haw.
Haw, haw, haw.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.567
No, haw. That a girl.
Good girl.

31:54.600 --> 31:55.733
Straight ahead.

Let's go, let's go, let's go.

31:57.267 --> 31:59.300
Let's go! Let's go! Come on.

31:59.333 --> 32:01.800
Sometimes you're in situations
where you want them

32:01.833 --> 32:02.933
to go a certain place

32:02.967 --> 32:05.967
or do a certain thing,
and they've gotta forget about

32:06.000 --> 32:07.533
what they think
they're supposed to do,

32:07.567 --> 32:10.000
and actually do
what you ask them to do.

32:10.033 --> 32:12.900
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

32:12.933 --> 32:14.833
Attaboy, Burgis.
Good job, buddy.

32:16.500 --> 32:17.533
Good job.

32:19.067 --> 32:20.167
Good girl, Tope.

32:21.633 --> 32:23.267
All right! Good girl!

32:23.300 --> 32:24.800
That was really good.

32:25.367 --> 32:26.667
All right!

32:27.233 --> 32:29.300
That was a good job.

32:29.333 --> 32:31.500
You're a good,
little lead dog.

32:31.533 --> 32:32.800
I'm impressed.

32:32.833 --> 32:35.700
Her first response was
to try and take
the route around it,

32:35.733 --> 32:42.433
but she immediately corrected
and went over
the old trail over thin ice,

32:42.467 --> 32:44.733
and it actually broke out
on us a little bit.

32:44.767 --> 32:46.867
I looked behind me
and saw the ice break out.

32:47.733 --> 32:50.000
So, that was really good.

32:50.033 --> 32:52.867
What really impressed me is
she responded quickly.

32:52.900 --> 32:55.000
Man, I think she's getting it
pretty good right now.

32:55.033 --> 32:56.800
I'm really happy with her.

32:56.833 --> 32:59.900
She's... As you can see
she's quite proud of herself.

32:59.933 --> 33:01.833
Aren't you?
You're quite proud
of yourself.

33:02.500 --> 33:03.533
Yeah.

33:03.567 --> 33:05.533
You did an awful good job,
you know?

33:05.567 --> 33:07.367
For a little punk.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.133
For a little punk,
you do pretty good.

33:10.167 --> 33:11.667
Hup, hup.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.133
Straight ahead. On by.

33:13.167 --> 33:14.900
She's having
a lot of fun up here.

33:14.933 --> 33:19.167
This is kind of the A-team,
and for her to
keep the line tight like this,

33:19.200 --> 33:23.333
and to take commands,
it's a really,
really positive sign.

33:23.367 --> 33:26.400
I think she's gonna
develop into
a really good lead dog.

33:27.100 --> 33:28.733
Attaboys.

33:28.767 --> 33:31.467
The key element for me is
just to keep working with her

33:31.500 --> 33:33.133
throughout
the rest of this winter,

33:33.167 --> 33:35.067
and I think
beginning next year

33:35.100 --> 33:37.200
she's gonna be
a super lead dog.

33:41.867 --> 33:43.367
CHIP: I don't live
in isolation.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.567
I have a wife.
I have seven kids.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.167
And I have
a village of friends

33:47.200 --> 33:49.067
and married-into relations.

34:07.300 --> 34:08.700
AGNES: Oh! They're back!

34:11.000 --> 34:12.267
You make it home!

34:13.533 --> 34:14.833
CHIP: Here you go.

34:14.867 --> 34:15.867
AGNES: Right on.

34:17.833 --> 34:19.967
Hi, sunshine.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.333
Hey, big girl!
You come to Noorvik?

34:23.367 --> 34:25.100
NARRATOR: After hours
of searching,

34:25.133 --> 34:28.767
Chip has rescued
Jon and Avery
from the freezing trail.

34:28.800 --> 34:32.467
With daylight slipping away,
the caribou hunt
will have to wait.

34:34.167 --> 34:35.600
(CHUCKLING)

34:36.633 --> 34:37.633
AGNES: All better now?

34:41.633 --> 34:43.300
CHIP: We use every reason
to celebrate. You know?

34:43.333 --> 34:46.900
And a birthday party
is a good time to celebrate.

34:46.933 --> 34:48.267
-So we make
the most of them all.
-(ALL SINGING)

34:48.300 --> 34:50.367
-Keep going, girl.
Keep going.
-AGNES: On Channel 4.

34:50.400 --> 34:53.300
-And Scooby Doo on Channel 2.
-ALL: Yeah!

34:53.333 --> 34:56.133
CHIP: When everyone's alive,
no one's injured...

34:56.167 --> 34:57.600
Your machine's still running.

34:58.867 --> 35:00.333
It's all good.

35:00.367 --> 35:02.500
It's stuff we can deal with.

35:02.533 --> 35:05.000
Yup. You gotta just
enjoy every day as it comes.

35:05.667 --> 35:06.967
AGNES: Real good cake?

35:07.000 --> 35:08.733
TING: It's chocolate.
It's your favourite, you know?

35:08.767 --> 35:10.133
(LAUGHTER)

35:10.167 --> 35:12.533
CHIP: That's what
the girls got,
or that's what the girls made.

35:12.567 --> 35:14.400
CAROL: I've got to wash
her face.
AGNES: Come, Carol.

35:14.433 --> 35:15.500
CHIP: No need
to wash her face,

35:15.533 --> 35:16.800
she's four years old.
We're fine.

35:19.500 --> 35:20.667
One side?

35:21.767 --> 35:23.133
Two sides!

35:23.167 --> 35:24.367
It's these ones?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.200
Pretty!

35:26.233 --> 35:28.367
I think she's happy for them.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.233
These are a pair of
Mouton mittens

35:30.267 --> 35:32.433
covered with pink cloth.

35:32.467 --> 35:35.933
So they're real nice
and pretty for little girls.
They're nice and warm.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.533
On her way here
she dropped
her pair of mittens,

35:38.567 --> 35:41.667
so um, she... Her hands
got a little bit chilly.

35:41.700 --> 35:43.000
So these are to replace

35:43.033 --> 35:44.500
the ones she lost
on her way over.

35:44.533 --> 35:47.167
So she should be warm
heading back home.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.400
Like anywhere else in
this world,

35:48.433 --> 35:49.767
there's a thousand ways
to die out here

35:49.800 --> 35:51.533
in your own special way.

35:51.567 --> 35:53.733
So, anytime you can
celebrate another birthday

35:53.767 --> 35:54.867
is a good thing.

35:59.400 --> 36:02.200
SUE: You don't really
get a choice
when a problem comes up.

36:02.233 --> 36:04.367
You do what you gotta do
when you need to do it,

36:04.400 --> 36:05.967
and that's just the way
life is here in Kavik.

36:15.700 --> 36:16.967
Today I got a storm in.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.967
Got some of my
chores done yesterday.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.600
But the storm that came in,

36:20.633 --> 36:22.533
southwest winds
blew up this stove,

36:22.567 --> 36:25.033
and all's I've got is
a small stove over there.

36:25.067 --> 36:30.067
Does not produce
enough heat to compensate
for when this one's out.

36:30.100 --> 36:33.200
This stove here,
it's useless to me right now,
but it's getting colder.

36:33.233 --> 36:34.933
I'm gonna be 20, 40 below.

36:34.967 --> 36:37.300
If I don't have enough heat,
I'm gonna freeze.

36:39.933 --> 36:42.600
So what I wanna do today is
go to another building,

36:42.633 --> 36:45.633
take a stove out of there
that produces more heat,
swap it out.

36:45.667 --> 36:49.233
Then I have enough to keep me,
you know, keep me at
a healthy temperature.

36:49.267 --> 36:50.800
Ideal conditions, no.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.733
Normally I'd hold off,

36:52.767 --> 36:54.933
but holding off could cost me
my life this time.

36:54.967 --> 36:56.733
You know? I cannot...

36:56.767 --> 36:58.333
You don't go to sleep
at 20 below,

36:58.367 --> 37:00.100
'cause you might not wake up.

37:00.133 --> 37:01.267
I gotta get on this.

37:03.367 --> 37:07.100
The one guarantee you get
is that your weather
is never guaranteed out here.

37:07.133 --> 37:09.300
Yesterday, I was out
getting the water, and...

37:10.567 --> 37:12.967
You could see that
there was a pattern changing.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.767
You know, and it's just gonna
keep getting worse.

37:14.800 --> 37:18.667
This storm is supposed to be
raging for a few days.

37:19.967 --> 37:21.667
All right.

37:21.700 --> 37:24.933
This is the stove
I'm gonna be trying
to change out.

37:24.967 --> 37:27.600
Again, these are not
optimal conditions
for doing this.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Come on, you.

37:33.733 --> 37:35.167
It doesn't wanna go willingly.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.500
Come on, you fucking puke!

37:40.367 --> 37:41.367
(GRUNTS)

37:44.300 --> 37:47.300
Now my job is to
get this back to
the other building.

37:49.500 --> 37:52.367
Again, it's not
ideal conditions
to do this in.

37:53.333 --> 37:55.333
You know, the snow is deep.

37:55.367 --> 37:58.433
It's blowing,
but nobody else here
gonna do it for me.

38:03.400 --> 38:07.067
I'm just coming off
the back injury,
so I gotta be careful.

38:19.900 --> 38:21.333
(YELLING)

38:21.367 --> 38:22.800
God damn it!

38:24.267 --> 38:25.600
(PANTING)

38:34.767 --> 38:36.333
Too painful.

38:36.367 --> 38:42.300
Too unpredictable for me
to carry it the normal way,
so I just drug it.

38:42.900 --> 38:43.900
Fuck it.

38:47.667 --> 38:49.367
Ah!

38:49.400 --> 38:52.800
NARRATOR: With a storm
approaching, Sue must
install the new stove

38:52.833 --> 38:55.400
if she is to keep her home
warm enough to survive.

38:56.433 --> 38:57.433
All right.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.100
Fucker.

39:01.133 --> 39:03.033
It's not
wanting to budge, man.

39:09.567 --> 39:12.967
I think a lot of people,
their method of
dealing with this

39:13.567 --> 39:14.900
is to call the plumber.

39:14.933 --> 39:18.200
I don't have the means
to call

39:18.233 --> 39:19.933
a technician in
and get it done.

39:19.967 --> 39:23.933
I have to be willing to
do my own work.

39:23.967 --> 39:28.600
No matter the conditions,
whether I'm happy or sad,
whether it's too heavy.

39:28.633 --> 39:31.067
You know, I mean,
I don't have a lot of options

39:31.100 --> 39:32.233
other than me.

39:34.467 --> 39:35.467
It ain't coming.

39:37.533 --> 39:38.567
Okay.

39:38.600 --> 39:39.633
Think, Susan.

39:41.400 --> 39:42.900
There we go.

39:42.933 --> 39:43.967
This is gonna
leak a little fuel,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.233
so I wanna get
the other one on real quick.

39:53.900 --> 39:54.900
Come on!

40:02.267 --> 40:03.267
Fuck it.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.133
(PANTING)

40:19.833 --> 40:20.900
There we go.

40:22.333 --> 40:23.433
Here goes nothing.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.567
Ta-da. Flamage.

40:30.367 --> 40:34.133
Not the best conditions
for doing the work in,
but score one for Suzie.

40:34.167 --> 40:35.267
I got it done.

40:35.300 --> 40:36.833
Makes me feel good.

40:36.867 --> 40:40.233
I am taking care of myself.

40:44.967 --> 40:46.633
GLENN: You are gonna die.

40:46.667 --> 40:48.067
There's no question about it.

40:48.100 --> 40:49.300
The question is
whether or not
you're gonna live,

40:49.333 --> 40:50.833
and half of the people
in this world are not living.

41:03.900 --> 41:06.567
I could use some
light in here,
so I'm gonna build a lamp.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.733
The fuel for the lamp
will be some moose fat.

41:09.767 --> 41:12.300
This is some fat
from a moose that I rendered.

41:12.333 --> 41:14.467
This fat's
a year and a half old.

41:14.500 --> 41:16.267
So it probably...

41:19.867 --> 41:20.933
It's all right.

41:20.967 --> 41:22.133
I can still eat it.

41:24.300 --> 41:27.300
But it's not as good as
fresh moose fat.

41:27.333 --> 41:29.833
It has re-solidified,
'cause it's cold,

41:29.867 --> 41:32.800
but I need to thaw that out
and melt it again.

41:33.667 --> 41:36.133
This is sphagnum moss.

41:36.167 --> 41:43.300
The same type of moss
that I use to cover
this house for insulation.

41:43.333 --> 41:48.567
And the same type of moss
that you can use
for all sorts of things.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.467
Run out of toilet paper,
it comes in handy.

41:53.133 --> 41:54.700
It can also be
used for a wick.

41:54.733 --> 41:58.233
And I'm just kind of
compacting that
with my hand.

42:00.300 --> 42:02.000
I got some moose fat.

42:02.033 --> 42:05.800
Now I'm gonna
pour some of this fat
onto the lamp.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.900
And before it gets solid

42:15.167 --> 42:17.233
I need to
get my wick in there.

42:19.067 --> 42:22.600
The moss is very absorbent,
and it's absorbing the fat.

42:22.633 --> 42:25.333
Okay. So, hopefully,
I'll have a flame
all across here.

42:25.367 --> 42:28.333
I'll be able to manipulate it
if everything goes right.

42:28.367 --> 42:30.400
If everything goes to hell,
it'll all burst into flame,

42:30.433 --> 42:32.033
and I'll have to
run out of here fast.

42:43.233 --> 42:46.133
Just trying to get the flame
to spread across
the whole thing

42:46.167 --> 42:47.533
so I'll have a lot of light.

42:48.500 --> 42:50.967
So there's my lamp.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.167
The nice thing about
this kind of lamp is that
the fuel is edible.

42:57.233 --> 43:00.267
If you're hungry,
you can always take a bite.

43:01.467 --> 43:02.900
Pretty nice setup I got here.

43:04.467 --> 43:06.400
Got no worries
if I have to abandon ship.

43:06.433 --> 43:08.867
I got a nice,
comfortable lifeboat
to run into here.

43:09.800 --> 43:10.833
Life's pretty good.
