WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:03.587
[Gerry] Alright. [sighs]

00:03.587 --> 00:06.465
Not the part of
the job I like...

00:06.465 --> 00:07.716
But it's why I'm
in this position,

00:07.716 --> 00:08.968
to help kids.

00:08.968 --> 00:11.553
It's why I teach.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.180
And frankly,
you guys are missing

00:13.180 --> 00:15.182
way too much class for hockey.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.434
Especially you MacKinnon.

00:17.434 --> 00:19.144
We need to talk about this.

00:19.144 --> 00:22.021
Because this is going to affect
your career and your future.

00:22.021 --> 00:24.650
And I need to step in,
especially you Nathan,

00:24.650 --> 00:26.276
'cause you are away a lot.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.570
What are your plans next year?

00:28.570 --> 00:30.865
I want to play professional
hockey next year.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.574
So do I,

00:32.574 --> 00:33.868
why don't I just go?

00:33.868 --> 00:36.077
Millions of kids do.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.746
Pretty much nobody makes it.

00:37.746 --> 00:41.625
-Have you ever seen him play?
-You're not helping.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.084
What are you doing
next year Cameron?

00:43.084 --> 00:46.922
I'm going to go to college,
to play hockey.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.090
Going to college to play hockey.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.010
Do you see how that works?

00:51.010 --> 00:53.387
I have a feeling, Nathan,

00:53.387 --> 00:54.930
you're not thinking
that right now.

00:54.930 --> 00:57.016
Have you been following
my career at all sir?

00:57.016 --> 00:59.351
Have you been following
my career?

00:59.351 --> 01:00.435
No.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.937
Great hockey player.

01:01.937 --> 01:04.439
Still great. Still great.

01:04.439 --> 01:06.066
And then I said,

01:06.066 --> 01:08.360
"Probably should go to school".

01:08.360 --> 01:09.945
Got a degree.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.279
Became a teacher.

01:11.279 --> 01:15.034
Got a job, $48,000 a year,
thank you.

01:15.034 --> 01:17.202
That I do with whatever I want.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.872
Anything I want I buy it.
Pretty much.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.957
'Cause I have a job.

01:21.957 --> 01:24.418
You? Hockey's not a job.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.754
Start coming to class.

01:26.754 --> 01:30.007
I'm not going to say it anymore.

01:30.007 --> 01:33.594
Wake up.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.553
Wow.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.471

-Hey Gerry.
-Hey.

01:56.199 --> 01:59.202
How is your
volleyball team doing?

01:59.202 --> 02:01.455
-Good.
-Great! Ready for the big game?

02:01.455 --> 02:03.123
-Yes sir.
-Ah, unfortunately,

02:03.123 --> 02:05.918
I'm going to need the gym
all this week after school.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.629
So, you're going to have to have
your practices elsewhere, okay?

02:08.629 --> 02:10.255
What are you talking about?
We have a game,

02:10.255 --> 02:12.507
where am I gonna move practice?
We need nets and stuff,

02:12.507 --> 02:13.842
-what do you mean elsewhere?
-Okay,

02:13.842 --> 02:15.385
they're
junior girls, okay?

02:15.385 --> 02:16.971
They can barely get
the ball over the net.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.097
That's so defeatist.

02:18.097 --> 02:19.514
And you're
the athletic director.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.349
That's how you run
your sports programs?

02:21.349 --> 02:23.143
You just give up on everybody?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.352
What do you need the gym for?

02:24.352 --> 02:25.353
I am teaching
a self-defense unit.

02:25.353 --> 02:26.897
-You are?
-Mmmhmm.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.440
What do you know about
teaching self-defense?

02:28.440 --> 02:30.150
I took a weekend
workshop, thank you.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.695
-Oooh a whole weekend workshop!
-Okay, it was intensive.

02:33.695 --> 02:36.490
It was a full weekend and I am
very qualified, trust me.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.241
That is ridiculous.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.868
You are kicking me
out of the gym for that?

02:39.868 --> 02:41.829
You know what?
I'm not asking you,

02:41.829 --> 02:43.413
I'm telling you.

02:43.413 --> 02:47.292
Well, you're putting the safety
of those kids in jeopardy.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.837
I should be teaching that!

02:53.172 --> 02:55.592
Trudy, I will be away tomorrow.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.970
I will be at the Library
Science's Conference

02:57.970 --> 03:00.014
Okay, I'll get someone
to cover the library.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.974
That's not the point,
and no thank you

03:01.974 --> 03:03.809
the library will be
closed tomorrow.

03:03.809 --> 03:06.478
You know that
is not our policy.

03:06.478 --> 03:09.314
Then don't let
Ms. Mason in there

03:09.314 --> 03:11.358
in my absence.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.401
What do you want Wayne?

03:14.695 --> 03:16.071
I have a very important package

03:16.071 --> 03:17.196
being delivered tomorrow

03:17.196 --> 03:19.783
-That's nice.
-No, it's not nice.

03:19.783 --> 03:22.327
It's very serious
and I need to know

03:22.327 --> 03:24.121
that I can trust you.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.540
That you won't open it.

03:26.540 --> 03:30.251
Or touch it.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.670
Wayne, I have no interest

03:31.670 --> 03:34.965
in touching your package.

03:34.965 --> 03:35.966
[Laughing]

03:35.966 --> 03:38.719
Touching your package.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.428
[Laughing]

03:40.428 --> 03:42.764
Sorry.

03:44.016 --> 03:46.226
This is serious.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.821
I just got it.

03:59.698 --> 04:02.117
It'll be here before noon.

04:11.210 --> 04:14.129
[Whispers] Okay.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.380
Mind if I join you?

04:15.380 --> 04:17.007
Not at all.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.175
-Mm.
-This is great,

04:18.175 --> 04:19.760
we never get to
eat lunch together.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.931
I know, spare twins!
Share and a spare.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.849
So I saw some of the
science fair projects

04:25.849 --> 04:26.934
that your kids were doing.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.018
It's really impressive.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.394
It just blows your mind, huh?

04:29.394 --> 04:31.230
Yeah, Jordan's project
on the aerodynamics

04:31.230 --> 04:33.481
of the mullet
is just like, boom!

04:33.481 --> 04:34.399
Thank you.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.068
[Lisa laughs]

04:36.068 --> 04:39.071
-Oh wow. Oh wow.
-Yeah, I know I saw that.

04:39.071 --> 04:41.364
I had no idea mullets
could make you move faster.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.366
Oh my god.
Oh cheese and rice.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.702
You know, they put
a lot of heart into it.

04:45.702 --> 04:50.040
-A lot of heart. Oh.
-Simon, are you crying?

04:50.040 --> 04:52.584
Oh, maybe a little.
I might be crying a little.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.920
-Awww.
-Yeah a little.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.755
Oh, do you want
some of my lunch?

04:56.755 --> 04:59.716
-Did you not like yours?
-You sure?

04:59.716 --> 05:01.135
Yeah, if you're not
hungry either,

05:01.135 --> 05:02.302
I can just toss this out
with the rest.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.678
No, no, no
I'm still going to eat.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.097
-We can toss that out.
-Simon.

05:05.097 --> 05:07.724
Okay, you want that.
Just want that, huh?

05:07.724 --> 05:10.310
-Mmmhmm.
-Just want to have that. Oh.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.686
I just remembered,
I don't think

05:11.686 --> 05:13.480
I have a spare today. So...

05:13.480 --> 05:15.065
Those kids are probably
waiting for me.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.400
[music]

05:23.115 --> 05:25.533
Still raining.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.911
All right. I don't know
how this is going to work out?

05:27.911 --> 05:30.122
But let's try to make
it work, okay?

05:30.122 --> 05:33.374
We're going to use a six two,
as I've explained.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.085
We'll have two setters,
we'll always have

05:35.085 --> 05:36.586
three hitters
in the front row.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.338
-Where's Coach Leung?
-Assistant Coach Leung

05:39.338 --> 05:41.508
is not here.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.177
-Yes Lucy.
-Sir, can I be a hitter

05:43.177 --> 05:44.303
instead of a setter?

05:44.303 --> 05:45.846
Sure! You can be both,
who cares?

05:45.846 --> 05:48.223
Nobody can hit or set.
Why do we care?

05:48.223 --> 05:51.310
Sir, this is boring,
why can't we go to the gym?

05:51.310 --> 05:53.478
I told you, it's raining outside

05:53.478 --> 05:55.563
and Ms. Galka is using the gym.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.149
Did you get kicked out?

05:57.149 --> 05:59.526
Is it because she's your boss
and can tell you what to do?

05:59.526 --> 06:02.279
No! She's not...

06:02.279 --> 06:04.656
Can we drop this? Can we get
back to this practice please?

06:04.656 --> 06:06.158
This is all we have,

06:06.158 --> 06:07.366
we have a game coming up.

06:07.366 --> 06:09.452
Let's do our drills, okay?

06:09.452 --> 06:10.996
Balls, straight line,

06:10.996 --> 06:11.997
pass the ball.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.081
You know the deal.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.749
Let's go, hurry up, pick it up.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.294
Try to get a good pass up here.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.504
To hit, ready?

06:19.504 --> 06:21.173
Nice. Not bad.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.217
Ready?

06:23.217 --> 06:24.759
One more.

06:24.759 --> 06:28.387
Okay, here we go.

06:28.387 --> 06:30.515
No.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.061
No, you don't have...

06:34.061 --> 06:36.230
Sir, I can't reach it

06:36.230 --> 06:38.106
We have other balls.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.317
This isn't going to work.

06:40.317 --> 06:43.070
Okay, the most effective
places to hit are:

06:43.070 --> 06:46.405
The eyes, nose, neck,
groin and knees.

06:46.405 --> 06:48.283
But, before any
of that can happen,

06:48.283 --> 06:50.409
it's important to
surprise your attacker

06:50.409 --> 06:51.410
with your voice.

06:51.410 --> 06:55.123
So, back off! Eyes! Eyes! Eyes!

06:55.123 --> 06:58.293
Right? Immediately
the attacker is taken aback.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.586
And then does she say

06:59.586 --> 07:02.172
please and thank you
when you're done?

07:02.172 --> 07:06.968
Because I would have sexually
assaulted you by now, Maya.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.803
You know what I mean.

07:08.803 --> 07:11.223
Okay. Thanks Mr. Duncan.
Great. Okay.

07:11.223 --> 07:13.892
So let's say I've got
you by the arm...right.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.852
Pull towards the thumb, Maya.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.980
-What are you doing here?
-Let me show you. Hi girls.

07:18.980 --> 07:19.981
Excuse me. Move Maya,

07:19.981 --> 07:21.482
I don't want you to get hurt.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.151
Alright,

07:23.151 --> 07:25.279
Ms. Galka approaches me.
Okay, grab my arm.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.321
-I'm not going to...
-Just grab my arm.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.655
Let me show them.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.657
Now, she's going to
sexually assault me.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.910
-[Quietly] Oh my god.
-To get out of this...

07:31.910 --> 07:32.869
Pull towards the thumb,

07:32.869 --> 07:34.121
-boom! Boom!
-Oh my god.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.664
Sexual assaulter, stunned, gone.

07:36.664 --> 07:37.999
You're out of the hold.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.834
Okay, keep in mind,
it doesn't have to be

07:39.834 --> 07:41.169
a sexual assaulter.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.503
Well, it's not
the Friendly Giant.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.256
Assume the worst
is what I'm saying.

07:44.256 --> 07:47.342
Assume it's the worst possible
person coming to get you.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.676
They're going to assault you.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.095
-Assume that.
-[Bobbi] Okay, thank you.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.471
If you'll excuse us please,
Mr. Duncan.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.931
Just trying to help,
because all you're doing

07:52.931 --> 07:55.142
is teaching them these
stupid little moves.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.061
Hold on and dance
around with me.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.272
Okay.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.232
-Grab my arm, Mr. Duncan.
-Oh boy.

08:02.232 --> 08:07.279
-Let's do this.
-[Gerry sighs]

08:07.279 --> 08:11.116
[Gerry]What are we gonna
be doing? Hey! What?

08:11.116 --> 08:14.619
-EYES! EYES! EYES!
-[Gerry] Ow.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.788
-Get me off?
-[Gerry] What?

08:16.788 --> 08:19.040
Try and get me off Mr. Duncan.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.708
[Gerry]
You should stop saying that.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.253
Mr. Duncan cannot get me off.

08:29.926 --> 08:33.305
[Bobbi takes a deep breath]

08:37.225 --> 08:40.395
Do me now.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.357
-[Gerry] What?
-Do me now.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.192
You need to listen
to yourself right now.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.277
[Bobbi] Okay, Mr. Duncan's
too scared to do me.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.862
-[Gerry whispers] Oh boy.
-[Bobbi] There are no rules

08:48.862 --> 08:51.323
in self-defense girls,
goodbye Mr. Duncan.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.200
-Yeah.

08:54.659 --> 08:55.869
Goodbye.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.079
[music]

09:06.796 --> 09:11.634
[Whispers] Oh my god.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.095
Seriously?

09:16.431 --> 09:18.308
[Bill yawns]

09:18.308 --> 09:21.936
-Hey, what's up man?
-Hey, what's happening?

09:23.938 --> 09:26.233
-Just having it plain?
-I need a lot of sugar

09:26.233 --> 09:28.151
and trying to stay
off protein so.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.319
Yeah you want to stick
with the healthy part,

09:29.319 --> 09:30.404
just the bread.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.780
-Yup.
-Yeah, that's the way to go.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.498
Actually,
maybe I will have some.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.083
-Yeah.
-It's a little dry.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.918
Here, I'm just going
to use it right now.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.128
-[Bill] Mmm.
-No, get it off.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.630
-Here, just give it to me...
-[Bill] Yeah, yeah.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.883
I'm just going to use it,
you didn't have...

09:51.883 --> 09:54.135
You didn't have to
put the lid on.

09:54.135 --> 09:57.347
-[Bill] Go ahead.
-[Gerry exhales]

09:57.347 --> 10:01.226
Try to stick to my guns.
Try to...stay on the diet.

10:01.226 --> 10:04.479
-[Bill] Yup.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.147
-Looks delicious.
-You bet.

10:06.147 --> 10:11.611
Where'd we get that,
that's good. Whole wheat.

10:11.611 --> 10:16.741
-[Bill] Mmmhmm.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.702
-Anything to drink?
-Mmm mmm.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.413
[inaudible] somewhere to go?

10:21.413 --> 10:24.541
-Mmm mmm.
-Oh, maybe a little.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.090
-Nah, you know what?
-[Bill] Yeah,

10:32.090 --> 10:33.800
it's better that way. Yeah.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.520
Trududy!

10:45.520 --> 10:46.729
What the hell is that?

10:46.729 --> 10:48.731
Mr. Leung's big package here.

10:48.731 --> 10:52.110
That's not what I heard.
[laughs]

10:52.110 --> 10:55.530
-I do not get it.
-Not often enough, eh Malik?

10:55.530 --> 10:57.616
Not often enough.

10:57.616 --> 11:00.994
Please, what would you
like me to do with your box?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.496
I'll tell you what I want
you to do with...

11:02.496 --> 11:05.248
Oh never mind.
Just put it over there.

11:09.628 --> 11:12.046
-Hey there lunch buddies.
-Hey, Lisa.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.007
Oh, no.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.760
Oh no, what?
Oh! What is that?

11:17.760 --> 11:21.181
-What? It's tuna.
-Oh god.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.183
-Put it away, cover it.
-What?

11:23.183 --> 11:26.144
You don't bring tuna
to a public eating area.

11:26.144 --> 11:29.564
At work, are you kidding me?
Oh my gosh.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.608
Go eat that in the
conference room, please.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.026
That's the smelly food
eating area now.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.235
-Gerry!
-Lisa,

11:34.235 --> 11:36.695
that is so insensitive to...

11:36.695 --> 11:38.532
-I can't eat mine.
-Simon?

11:38.532 --> 11:39.949
-[Gerry] No, he agrees. Go.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.494
Please, just eat
in the conference room.

11:42.494 --> 11:46.956
My god. It's probably bad
by the smell of it.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.543
[Gerry] Wow! When you're done
you can come join us.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.628
If you wash it out.

11:51.628 --> 11:52.504
[Simon exhales]

11:52.504 --> 11:53.712
[Gerry] Who does that?

11:53.712 --> 11:54.964
Shut the door!

11:54.964 --> 11:56.799
I still smell it.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.843
Thank you.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.931
-It's better isn't it?
-Thank you.

12:03.931 --> 12:07.185
Yeah, you would have just
sat there, wouldn't you?

12:07.185 --> 12:09.521
I don't know what to
say in that situation,
that was really good.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.356
-What am I supposed to do?
-[Simon mumbles] I dunno.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.024
What are you, supposed to
just sit there and be polite?

12:13.024 --> 12:15.485
-[Simon] I would, yeah..
-No, that's crazy.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.862
-Just throwing my lunch out.
-You tell people.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.532
If your food smells,
go eat it somewhere else.

12:20.532 --> 12:23.076
[Gerry] Can you move in more?
We still smell it!

12:23.076 --> 12:25.412
Just slide your chair
a bit further away!

12:25.412 --> 12:27.539
-Go further than that please!
-[Simon] Put a towel...

12:27.539 --> 12:29.583
-[Gerry] We still smell it.
-Tell her to put a towel down

12:29.583 --> 12:31.167
on the crack of the door there.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.217
Trudy? What's this?

12:39.217 --> 12:40.594
Package for Leung.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.304
It's so big.
It could be anything,

12:43.304 --> 12:45.014
-what's inside?
-I don't care.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.765
You don't think he'd
have anything illegal

12:46.765 --> 12:48.351
shipped to the school, do you?

12:48.351 --> 12:51.271
He might.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.482
How can you not
be interested, Trudy?

12:54.482 --> 12:56.901
I've always been curious,
even as a little boy I'd...

12:56.901 --> 12:58.653
Shake my Christmas
presents to try

12:58.653 --> 12:59.654
and figure out what was inside.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.740
'Til the year my grandpa died.

13:01.740 --> 13:04.158
[Trudy] Wow, lucky him.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.160
Listen, whatever's in that box

13:06.160 --> 13:07.662
has nothing to do with me.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.038
End of story.

13:09.038 --> 13:12.500
You're a stronger woman
than I Trudy.

13:12.500 --> 13:16.296
[Trudy] Yeah. My mother's
a stronger woman than you.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.300
[Gerry]
And that is when the, ah,

13:20.300 --> 13:22.135
US defeated the British.

13:22.135 --> 13:26.097
Yeah, kind of like how
Ms. Galka defeated you.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.015
Ms. Galka did not
defeat me Jimmy.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.017
I heard she pinned you
in under three seconds.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.852
Is that what you heard?

13:31.852 --> 13:33.772
And you think this bothers me?

13:33.772 --> 13:35.649
It doesn't bother me people.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.900
Don't worry sir,
Ms. Galka's pretty strong.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.110
You shouldn't feel embarrassed.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.028
I am not embarrassed.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.030
Let me explain something
to all of you.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.783
[Gerry] Men do not hit women.

13:44.783 --> 13:48.911
And if you don't know that
by now, you should.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.955
This is a society
where we do not do that.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.749
That is so outdated.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.501
There are some women in MMA

13:54.501 --> 13:55.627
that would kill you in a fight.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.045
Yeah, 'cause I'd have
to let them.

13:58.045 --> 14:00.340
And first of all,
why am I in an MMA ring

14:00.340 --> 14:01.675
with a woman who I can't hit?

14:01.675 --> 14:03.760
Not gonna happen. Can't win,

14:03.760 --> 14:05.762
because I'd have to let them.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.514
And secondly, Ms. Galka

14:07.514 --> 14:08.765
didn't even give me a warning.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.392
She caught me off guard,
little unfair too.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.436
[Jimmy and Ben laugh]

14:19.108 --> 14:21.861
Caught you off guard,
didn't it?

14:21.861 --> 14:24.447
Let's get back to work.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.991
Whooo!

14:26.991 --> 14:29.786
[ Music]

14:29.786 --> 14:32.038
Look who it is.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.373
Surprise attack anyone lately?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.124
I'm surprised you
underestimated me.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.334
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.044
-How's the self-defense?
Are you...

14:38.044 --> 14:41.005
learning how to defend yourself,
from an attack?

14:41.005 --> 14:42.841
Doesn't look like it. You gonna
let somebody get this close?

14:42.841 --> 14:44.718
-That's good enough Gerry.
-Is that what you're gonna do?

14:44.718 --> 14:47.178
'Cause when they're this
close they could grab...oh!

14:47.178 --> 14:48.847
-[laughs]
-Oh my gosh.

14:48.847 --> 14:52.308
-[Gerry in pain] Ohh.
-[Maya] Sir, I'm so sorry.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.018
-[Bobbi laughing] Totally
inappropriate, but good job!

14:54.018 --> 14:56.521
-It worked!
-[Bobbi] I can't believe
that worked! Oh!

14:56.521 --> 14:58.939
-Ohhh, Gerry!
-[Gerry] Ohh.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.984
Who's laughing now? What are you
thinking? What are you thinking?

15:01.984 --> 15:03.778
-You scared me!
-[Gerry inhales in pain]

15:03.778 --> 15:05.530
-[Bobbi exhales in pain]
-[Gerry] Get to class!

15:05.530 --> 15:09.409
-[Maya] Ms. Galka.
-[Bobbi] Ahh.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.452
-Are you okay?
-[Gerry] Get to class!

15:11.452 --> 15:15.289
[ Music]

15:15.289 --> 15:17.458
Okay, let me get this straight.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.628
Mr. Duncan, you swiped
Ms. Galka's feet...
-[Bobbi] Mmmhmm.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.715
-[Callaghan] Out from
underneath her, in the hallway.
-Yeah.

15:23.715 --> 15:27.594
'Cause Ms. Garland
here tried to kill me.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.803
[Bobbi] I was showing her a move

15:28.803 --> 15:31.013
how to fend off
violent attackers sir.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.724
And how'd the move
work out for you?

15:32.724 --> 15:35.643
May I remind you that we are
trying to run a school here?

15:35.643 --> 15:37.729
Yeah, I understand that sir,
but we can't have students

15:37.729 --> 15:39.647
-running around assaulting
teachers in broad daylight.
-I didn't...

15:39.647 --> 15:42.442
Okay, that's it.
Enough Mr. Duncan

15:42.442 --> 15:44.652
-Ms. Galka, how is your elbow?
-It hurts.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.321
-Suck it up, do you know
what bone you landed on?
-Who cares Mr. Duncan?

15:47.321 --> 15:50.199
-Olecranon process, another
reason I should be in Phys Ed.

15:50.199 --> 15:53.536
-Keep icing it.
-And compression,
rest, elevation.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.288
-And keep up the good work.
-Thank you, sir.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.665
-Thank you, sir.
-Yeah, keep up the good work.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.877
-Teaching students to assault
teachers. That's nice.
-[Bobbi sighs exasperated]

16:00.877 --> 16:04.422
-What were you thinking?
-Sir, you missed when she took
me down in front of the kids.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.340
Okay, that's it.
Enough. Good bye.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.968
-And what are we going
to do about Maya?
-[Callaghan] Nothing.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.597
Okay, that's a great
message we're sending.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.557
Why don't we just have a
"Poke your teacher in the neck"

16:14.557 --> 16:15.725

16:15.725 --> 16:17.435
Is this where education
is going, sir?

16:17.435 --> 16:19.145
[In a hoarse voice]
I still have trouble talking.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.773
I can hardly breathe sometimes.

interest you, does it? Noo.

And then it just goes.

from his conference.

have to move it then,

Fine, I'll do it myself.

Heavy, is it?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.641
What's in here? A new library?

16:56.641 --> 17:00.227
Listen, I'd help ya,
but I'm way over here. So...

17:00.227 --> 17:03.272

19:28.375 --> 19:30.210
Hi Wayne.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.462
Who does that?

19:31.462 --> 19:33.506
Congratulations,
you passed the test.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.758
-Great.
-What test?

19:35.758 --> 19:37.259
The real package
will show up tomorrow.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.262
Good news, I trust you now.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.264
How long have you been in there?

19:42.264 --> 19:43.850
As long as it took.

19:43.850 --> 19:47.394
Come on, let's get you
some fresh air.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.605
Jerk-in-the-box. Shall we?

19:49.605 --> 19:51.774
So just to be clear,
that was your...

19:51.774 --> 19:54.234
dead grandfather
in the box, was it?

19:56.236 --> 20:00.158
[Leung grunts and groans]

20:00.158 --> 20:02.326
Oh, agh! Ahhh!

20:04.537 --> 20:07.498
-See ya sir.
-See ya later.

20:07.498 --> 20:10.126
Gerry, congratulations.
Good game!

20:10.126 --> 20:11.752
Oh, thanks Bobbi.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.212
Nice game Mr. Duncan.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.714
-Hello.
-I'm Sharon Turner,

20:14.714 --> 20:16.256
I'm the new principal
of St. Pat's.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.258
Oh yeah, I heard
they got a new principal.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.219
Well, nice to meet you.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.512
So you teach Phys Ed here?

20:21.512 --> 20:23.181
I have a degree
in kinesiology, so...

20:23.181 --> 20:26.893
-No, so no he doesn't.
-So no, he doesn't.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.770
Oh, such a shame Callaghan

20:29.770 --> 20:32.065
doesn't use his teachers
to their full potential.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.900
Although, it sounds like
something he'd do.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.403
If there's ever an opening
for Phys Ed at St. Pat's,

20:37.403 --> 20:39.030
I'll know where to find you.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.032
-Congratulations.
-[Gerry] Thank you.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.203
-I just got head hunted.

20:45.203 --> 20:48.288
-You know that's Callaghan's
ex-girlfriend, right?
-Really?

20:48.288 --> 20:50.083
-Yup.
-Wow!

20:50.083 --> 20:51.417
He dates a lot of women.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.044
I would not go there.

20:53.044 --> 20:56.672
Not that you'd have a chance,
cuz you know, you, so.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.883
[Bobbi Laughs]

20:58.883 --> 21:01.719
Okay, I'll see you on Monday

21:02.720 --> 21:03.804
Yes.
