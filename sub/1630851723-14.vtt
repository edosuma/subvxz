00:06.107 --> 00:08.342
We should've just
stayed at that cute
little B&B in town.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.444
It had great
reviews online.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.147
And beds.

00:13.281 --> 00:14.515

00:14.648 --> 00:16.450
Where would
the fun be in that?

00:17.451 --> 00:19.653

00:19.787 --> 00:20.921
It's creepy out here.

00:21.055 --> 00:21.889
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.491
Come on.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.493
This was my family's spot
when I was little.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.231
Where they terrorized you
with campfire stories

00:30.364 --> 00:31.865
about
the Whispering Woman.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.667
(CHUCKLES) Yes.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.271
She haunted my childhood,
it's true.

00:38.772 --> 00:41.975

I'm no longer little.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.385
How should I know?

00:51.519 --> 00:53.387
A squirrel, maybe?

00:53.521 --> 00:55.656
Or it's
the Whispering Woman.

00:55.789 --> 00:56.824
Mm, funny.

01:50.844 --> 01:51.712
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

01:53.881 --> 01:55.549
That was Tadashi.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.186
He finished his dive
into Vandyke's laptop,

01:58.319 --> 01:59.953
as you requested.

02:00.087 --> 02:01.855
Did he discover
any pearls,

02:01.989 --> 02:05.092
like who hired Vandyke
to assassinate Elizabeth?

02:05.226 --> 02:06.894
No.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.863
Well, did he
at least confirm
that Vandyke

02:09.997 --> 02:11.299
was, in fact, tracking her

02:11.432 --> 02:12.733
on the night of her death?

02:12.866 --> 02:14.802
Yes.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.638
Vandyke was using an app
to monitor her location,

02:17.771 --> 02:20.174
but that is not all
there is to it.

02:20.308 --> 02:21.609
I feel a twist coming.

02:22.410 --> 02:23.977
According to the app,

02:24.111 --> 02:26.580
Tadashi believes
the RF device
inside Elizabeth

02:26.714 --> 02:29.650
was designed to perform
two functions.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.952
It transmits
GPS coordinates,

02:32.085 --> 02:34.788
and it monitors
timed medication.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.158
I read

02:38.292 --> 02:39.293
the toxicology report.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.962
It found nothing unusual

02:42.095 --> 02:43.063
in Elizabeth's system.

02:43.197 --> 02:44.432
She wasn't drugged.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.133
Maybe whoever
slipped her the tracker

02:46.267 --> 02:48.336
didn't require full use
of its medical abilities.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.103
But as a medical device,

02:50.238 --> 02:52.406
it was small enough
for her to ingest.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.508
We're talking to
the wrong people.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.677
We don't need tech experts.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.011
We need medical ones.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.380
We need to talk to Herbie.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.614
I already sent a courier

03:00.748 --> 03:01.815
to his home this morning

03:01.949 --> 03:02.950
with the tracker,

03:03.083 --> 03:04.017
but he's not responding

03:04.151 --> 03:05.253
to my calls.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.987
Are you two in some sort
of a disagreement?

03:07.120 --> 03:09.122
A disagreement with Herbie?

03:09.257 --> 03:10.190
The man likes conflict

03:10.324 --> 03:11.058
as much as I like

03:11.191 --> 03:12.326
an overcooked egg.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.961
And it's not like him

03:14.094 --> 03:15.663
to not answer.
Try him again.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.632
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

03:22.270 --> 03:23.937

03:24.071 --> 03:25.539
Please, call me Cynthia.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.976
Cynthia, I'm afraid

03:29.109 --> 03:32.346
we're not fully equipped
for social calls here,

03:32.480 --> 03:35.849
but I couldn't refuse
your request to meet.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.151
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

03:38.286 --> 03:39.920
Well, this is difficult
enough, Raymond.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.522
Let's just cut to the gristle.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.566
I need your help.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.936
I suspected you might.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.805
You know I'd only come to you

03:57.938 --> 04:00.040
if my situation
were desperate.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.742
It's been three weeks

04:01.875 --> 04:03.711
since my daughter-in-law
went missing.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.879
Yes, I've been
following the news.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.281
I'm terribly sorry.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.582
The news you don't know,

04:08.716 --> 04:10.584
because I'm keeping it
from the press,

04:10.718 --> 04:13.821
is that Sheila resurfaced
last night at a campsite.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.256
No help from
the local authorities,
mind you.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.691
She was half dead.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.395
Emaciated, tortured.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.533
Now Sheila is in
a medically-induced coma

04:25.666 --> 04:27.267
while whoever did this
to her is still...

04:27.401 --> 04:28.702
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

04:28.836 --> 04:32.706

04:36.043 --> 04:38.245
while Sheila's
lying in a coma,

04:38.379 --> 04:42.816
and you're feeling helpless.

04:42.950 --> 04:46.286
When nothing
makes sense
in the light,

04:46.420 --> 04:48.121
we have to search
in the dark.

04:50.558 --> 04:52.460
(SIGHS)

04:52.593 --> 04:54.161
I had a feeling
you'd understand.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.799
COOPER: Police interviewed
the two campers

04:58.932 --> 05:00.434
who Sheila Panabaker found,

05:00.568 --> 05:02.670
but she collapsed
without saying a word.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.905
So no idea
where she came from.

05:05.038 --> 05:08.108
The woods
where she surfaced
are 12,000 acres

05:08.241 --> 05:10.678
of rural, mostly
unincorporated area.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.713
It's a lot of ground
to cover.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.549
Sheila's currently in a coma
at Chesapeake Bay Memorial,

05:15.683 --> 05:16.650
fighting for her life.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.619
I have sympathy
for Panabaker,

05:18.752 --> 05:20.087
but does

05:20.220 --> 05:21.522
in which
the abduction is over

merit this task force's
attention?

05:23.090 --> 05:24.091
It does for me.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.326
I'm surprised the FBI
isn't already on it,

05:26.460 --> 05:28.061
given Senator Panabaker's
position.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.262
She asked for us.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.431
RESSLER: I think
you mean Reddington.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.165
Where is he anyway?

05:32.299 --> 05:34.768
He has a lead
on the tracking device
they found on Elizabeth,

05:34.902 --> 05:37.204
but he assured me that
he will be available
for whatever we need.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.941
Look, Cynthia's gone to bat
for this task force
time and time again.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.376
We owe her this.

05:42.510 --> 05:45.479
Ressler, Aram,
go to the hospital,
talk to Sheila's doctor.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.114
Uh, does it, uh,
have to be me?

05:47.247 --> 05:49.450
I mean, I... I... I...
I kind of have
things to do.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.019
What things?

05:52.152 --> 05:54.154
Oh, uh, you know, just, like,
uh, computer things.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.056
It's all...
It's all technical.
It's boring stuff.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.592
Of course.
Park, go with Ressler.

05:58.726 --> 06:01.161
If we can find out
from Sheila's doctor
what was done to her,

06:01.294 --> 06:02.796
it might help us
figure out who did it.

06:08.969 --> 06:12.205
I still don't understand
how Sheila got out.

06:12.339 --> 06:16.877
Well, maybe it's because
we have too many patients
and I'm spread too thin.

06:17.010 --> 06:17.878
What if she leads
the police to us?

06:18.812 --> 06:21.048
She won't.

06:21.181 --> 06:23.917
She left at night.
That had to have been
disorienting.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.786
She walked for days
and wound up
50 miles from here.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.155
I'm not concerned
about her.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.425
But we now
have an empty bed
that we need to fill,

06:32.960 --> 06:34.194
and lucky for us,

06:35.529 --> 06:37.064
I think I found
a new prospect.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.202
I just said I can
barely handle this.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.738
It's not the right time
to bring in someone new.

06:44.872 --> 06:47.775

our mission is.

hypothermic when she came in.

06:56.884 --> 06:59.553
She's dehydrated,
malnourished.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.154
I suppose being
lost in the woods

07:01.288 --> 07:03.123
for days in the cold
with no food or water
would do that.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.993
A lot of it,
but not the heart damage.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.061
She has heart damage?
Yeah, it's enlarged,

07:08.195 --> 07:11.298
with a reduced
left ventricular function.

07:11.431 --> 07:15.769
But when
I examined her further,
things got...stranger.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.370
At first I thought these
were just knife wounds,

07:17.505 --> 07:19.439

07:19.573 --> 07:22.242
but when
we cleaned away
the blood,

07:22.375 --> 07:23.877
we found this.

07:27.515 --> 07:28.448
Are those names?

07:28.582 --> 07:30.383
Yeah, that'd be my guess.

07:30.518 --> 07:31.885
And they appear
self-inflicted.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.387
Why would she carve names
into her own leg?

Sheila did that?

For God's sake, why?

08:47.661 --> 08:50.764
This is conjecture,
but we believe
she knew she might die

08:50.898 --> 08:53.133
and wanted to send
a message to whoever
found her body,

08:53.266 --> 08:55.803
to let them know
there are other victims
still out there.

are incredibly common,

09:04.477 --> 09:05.946
I was able to
narrow down the search

38:32.778 --> 38:34.780
and you're doing
exemplary work,

38:34.913 --> 38:37.483
but I don't have time
to be polite.

38:37.616 --> 38:41.319
So, please, tell me what
you know about this device.

38:43.088 --> 38:44.623
Where did this come from?

38:44.756 --> 38:46.257
You tell me,
and we'll both know.

38:46.392 --> 38:49.628
I'm... I'm not
wildly familiar with it,

38:49.761 --> 38:51.563
but it looks to be a prototype

38:51.697 --> 38:53.932
of something I saw last year.

38:54.065 --> 38:56.301
We were going to initiate
a pilot program

38:56.435 --> 38:57.736
with some of
my mood disorder patients.

38:57.869 --> 39:01.373
It, uh, monitors
medication use,

39:01.507 --> 39:05.310
but patient advocacy groups
were worried about privacy,

39:05.444 --> 39:08.113
so the whole thing
just kind of fell apart.

39:08.246 --> 39:09.448
Who developed
the device?

39:10.281 --> 39:11.717
It's a tragic story, actually.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.785
A lot of those
going around.

39:15.421 --> 39:16.755
A young man came to my office

39:16.888 --> 39:18.424
begging to be seen.

39:18.557 --> 39:19.525
His wife suffered from

39:19.658 --> 39:21.427
an acute
psychiatric condition.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.094
I-I-I-I don't
recall which,

39:23.228 --> 39:24.996
but she was
always inconsistent

39:25.130 --> 39:27.165
about her meds.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.801
And then one day, she had
a tragically violent episode

39:29.935 --> 39:31.069
that cost innocent lives.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.905
The man was devastated.

39:34.039 --> 39:37.509
He went back to school,
and he developed
an ingestible tracker

39:37.643 --> 39:40.311
that could monitor
a patient's compliance

39:40.446 --> 39:43.014
so that no one else would
have to live that nightmare.

39:43.148 --> 39:45.316
He pleaded with me
to give the tech a shot.

39:45.451 --> 39:47.619
Like I said, I had every
intention of testing it...

39:47.753 --> 39:49.120
Do you remember
the man's name?

39:49.254 --> 39:51.356
(SIGHS)

39:51.490 --> 39:53.525
It started with a "K,"
I know.

39:53.659 --> 39:56.127
Um... Kennison.

39:56.261 --> 40:00.532
Yes, uh, Andrew Kennison.

40:00.666 --> 40:01.833
(CLEARS THROAT)

40:05.303 --> 40:07.706
You wouldn't have actually
shot me, would you?

40:07.839 --> 40:09.007
If she was
going to shoot you,

40:09.140 --> 40:10.842
she would have
pointed the gun at you.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.148
(SIGHS) Hey.

40:17.282 --> 40:18.416
I got here
as soon as I could.

40:18.550 --> 40:19.851
Is this about the case?

40:19.985 --> 40:21.252
It's not.

40:21.386 --> 40:24.389
Agent Ressler,
did you attend your
NA meeting tonight?

40:24.523 --> 40:26.191
Yeah, of course I did.
I always go...

40:26.324 --> 40:28.359
I'm sorry,
but what's this all about?

40:28.494 --> 40:29.327
I mean...

40:31.497 --> 40:33.298
Does no one trust me?

40:33.431 --> 40:35.867
I mean, first, Aram
doesn't want to go out
in the field with me,

40:36.001 --> 40:39.605
and then you guys are
all talking behind my back
about my sponsor?

40:39.738 --> 40:41.540
I'm doing the meetings.
I'm doing the steps.

40:41.673 --> 40:43.942
I'm clean. (SCOFFS)

40:44.075 --> 40:45.711
I don't need
this intervention crap.

40:45.844 --> 40:48.046
Oh. Well, that's not
what this is.

40:48.179 --> 40:50.682
Oh, no, no. So, what?
I'm crazy now, huh?

40:50.816 --> 40:52.450
Is that it? Great.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.452
So, in case everybody's
lost count,

40:54.586 --> 40:57.255
I just got my two-month chip
yesterday from that sponsor

40:57.388 --> 40:59.591
that you guys definitely
weren't talking about.

40:59.725 --> 41:00.792
Look, I'm trying here.

41:00.926 --> 41:02.427
I'm really trying.

41:02.561 --> 41:03.562
And we couldn't be prouder.

41:06.431 --> 41:09.434
We knew this was
a big milestone for you.

41:09.568 --> 41:11.169
We wanted
your sponsor's name

41:11.302 --> 41:14.405
in case they
wanted to join us.

41:14.540 --> 41:15.607
For what?

41:15.741 --> 41:17.475
Your party.
Ta-da!

41:17.609 --> 41:19.110
Oh, my God.

41:19.244 --> 41:21.446
It, uh, took me a few tries
to, uh, pick up the cake,

41:21.580 --> 41:22.280
but I got there.

41:22.413 --> 41:23.882
Wow. Wow.

41:24.015 --> 41:25.617
Oh, I also made
a killer playlist.
(SNIFFLES)

41:25.751 --> 41:27.452
Oh, God. Not with that
damn playlist again.

41:27.586 --> 41:29.621
DEMBE: He's been
obsessing all week.

41:29.755 --> 41:30.922
I'm really dumb.

41:31.723 --> 41:35.026
Look, I'm sorry.
I, uh...

41:35.160 --> 41:38.463
I know I'm not always
the, uh, feelings guy,

41:38.597 --> 41:39.931
but this really...

41:42.233 --> 41:43.301
Means...

41:43.434 --> 41:44.469
We know what it means.

41:44.603 --> 41:45.937
And you mean
the same thing to us.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.508
Thank you. Truly.

41:50.642 --> 41:52.077
** Ah, invincible...

41:52.210 --> 41:53.344
(SCOFFS)

41:55.614 --> 41:57.649
** When we love...

41:57.783 --> 41:58.917
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

41:59.050 --> 42:03.689
** Ah, invincible...

42:03.822 --> 42:05.757
Do you want
the big slice there?
Sure.

42:05.891 --> 42:07.458
** When we love **

42:07.593 --> 42:09.294
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

42:09.427 --> 42:10.962
(LAUGHTER)

42:13.264 --> 42:16.334
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

42:16.467 --> 42:18.469
(LAUGHTER)

42:20.839 --> 42:24.375
****
