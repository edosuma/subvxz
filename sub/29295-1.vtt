01:12.343 --> 01:14.142
Why you running, Frank?

01:14.144 --> 01:15.978
You don't wanna play with us?

01:15.980 --> 01:18.981
I know a game,
but we need another player.

01:18.983 --> 01:20.682
It's called pound the hillbilly.

01:46.110 --> 01:48.443
Mom!

01:48.445 --> 01:50.679
Mom, help!

01:50.681 --> 01:53.348
Mom... help!

01:53.350 --> 01:56.518
Mommy, not coming, little Frankie.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.021
- What about your daddy?
- Doesn't have one.

01:59.023 --> 02:01.023
I do have a father.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.760
Fight, Frank.

02:04.762 --> 02:06.261
Fight.

02:07.798 --> 02:10.499
Mom!

02:41.131 --> 02:43.465
Thanks, Corky.

02:43.467 --> 02:44.666
Good boy.

02:45.836 --> 02:47.836
Who did you piss off this time?

02:47.838 --> 02:51.640
I get my face smashed in
and it's my fault?

02:51.642 --> 02:53.108
I called for you.

02:53.110 --> 02:55.077
I had the radio on.

02:55.079 --> 02:57.679
- Corky heard me.
- Dogs have better hearing.

02:59.416 --> 03:00.615
Frank.

03:02.719 --> 03:05.087
Life is tough.

03:05.089 --> 03:07.823
Sometimes there's nobody there
to help you.

03:19.103 --> 03:21.236
Corky.

03:21.238 --> 03:23.405
Dad?

03:23.407 --> 03:25.307
Dad!

03:25.309 --> 03:27.242
Hey, Corky.

03:27.244 --> 03:29.244
Hey, Frank.

03:30.647 --> 03:32.747
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Ooh, what's the matter?

03:32.749 --> 03:34.316
What happened?

03:34.318 --> 03:36.184
Trouble at school.

03:36.186 --> 03:38.453
Hey, you should see
the other kids.

03:38.455 --> 03:40.889
Yeah, well,
does you mother know?

03:40.891 --> 03:43.792
Where is her ladyship?

03:45.295 --> 03:46.728
Think she'll be happy to see me?

03:46.730 --> 03:48.530
Yeah.

03:53.337 --> 03:55.670
What are you doing here?

03:55.672 --> 03:58.240
Well, I just came to see
your beautiful smile.

03:58.242 --> 04:01.643
- What do you want?
- I want to see my son.

04:01.645 --> 04:04.179
Well, you just saw him,
now leave.

04:04.181 --> 04:05.480
Come on, Frank, let's go inside.

04:05.482 --> 04:07.482
- Let's go inside!
- No!

04:07.484 --> 04:09.251
Frank is gonna stay right here.

04:13.190 --> 04:15.423
Give us a chance
to catch up, okay, son?

04:15.425 --> 04:16.658
Sure, Pop.

04:22.399 --> 04:25.400
How the hell did you find us?

04:25.402 --> 04:28.403
Well you're not exactly
Miss Inconspicuous.

04:28.405 --> 04:30.572
I told you to leave.

04:30.574 --> 04:33.742
And I'm telling you the judge
ordered you to stay in Chicago

04:33.744 --> 04:35.644
and to notify the court
and or me

04:35.646 --> 04:37.179
if you intended to leave.

04:37.181 --> 04:39.181
Well the judge only knows
the law,

04:39.183 --> 04:40.649
but I know what's best
for my son.

04:40.651 --> 04:42.384
To raise him without his father?

04:42.386 --> 04:44.419
I only married you out of pity.

04:44.421 --> 04:46.855
A promise I made to my mother
on her death bed.

04:46.857 --> 04:49.391
God knows what she ever saw
in you.

04:49.393 --> 04:52.394
I know you never wanted me.

04:52.396 --> 04:54.663
But I also know
that you never wanted him.

04:54.665 --> 04:56.331
You just don't want me
to have him.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.333
Get the hell out!

05:01.538 --> 05:03.538
I love that boy.

05:03.540 --> 05:06.274
Something that you'll
never understand.

05:06.276 --> 05:08.376
So you can runaway, hide,

05:08.378 --> 05:10.412
and whatever your deranged
mind can think up,

05:10.414 --> 05:12.948
but I promise you this,

05:12.950 --> 05:15.217
that if I can't see my son,

05:15.219 --> 05:17.319
the judge hears
you skipped town,

05:17.321 --> 05:19.621
and I get full custody.

05:24.995 --> 05:27.796
Fine!

05:30.834 --> 05:33.268
Fine.

05:37.474 --> 05:40.475
Now you know I have to be
in the city for work.

05:40.477 --> 05:43.478
Can't stay here.

05:43.480 --> 05:45.647
But what if you came to visit me

05:45.649 --> 05:47.649
every other weekend in Chicago?

05:47.651 --> 05:49.651
Really?

05:49.653 --> 05:51.820
Yeah.
Pick you up on Saturday.

05:51.822 --> 05:53.822
I want you to go now.

05:53.824 --> 05:56.825
- Can Pop stay for dinner?
- No, he can't.

05:56.827 --> 05:59.761
- But it's gonna get dark soon.
- Well then he better get going.

05:59.763 --> 06:01.363
It's okay, all right?

06:01.365 --> 06:03.865
We're gonna see each other
on Saturday.

06:03.867 --> 06:05.567
Promise?

06:05.569 --> 06:07.669
Well, there's only one way
to make a promise.

06:07.671 --> 06:12.440
Get up, stand on that side
of the fence.

06:12.442 --> 06:14.509
Cowboys binding contract.

06:14.511 --> 06:16.745
I stand on this side.

06:16.747 --> 06:18.747
Now we shake hands.

06:22.853 --> 06:24.886
I give you my word.

06:29.493 --> 06:31.426
I wish you could stay.

06:31.428 --> 06:34.429
Well, you got a hug
for your old man?

06:36.433 --> 06:38.800
Oh, man,
how'd you get so strong?

06:38.802 --> 06:40.368
Chocolate.

06:40.370 --> 06:42.871
Chocolate, huh?

06:42.873 --> 06:48.043
Well, maybe this will tide you
over till Saturday.

06:48.045 --> 06:51.613
Just don't let your mom see it.

07:02.592 --> 07:05.593
Now I'll always be with you.

07:10.801 --> 07:12.801
Thanks, Pop.

07:15.372 --> 07:18.073
So long, cowboy.

07:41.598 --> 07:43.398

07:52.909 --> 07:54.909

13:24.441 --> 13:26.808

on the ground...

13:26.810 --> 13:28.176
Both suspects are drunk.

13:28.178 --> 13:30.178
Male suspect became aggressive
I had to subdue him.

13:31.314 --> 13:33.314
He was cuffed on the ground.

17:31.521 --> 17:34.255
Well, we haven't heard
the end of this.

17:34.257 --> 17:36.257
I'll keep you in the loop.

17:36.259 --> 17:38.059
Shouldn't you be in school, son?

17:38.061 --> 17:39.527
Uh, this is Mitch Myers.

17:39.529 --> 17:42.063
- He's rookie.
- No shit.

17:42.065 --> 17:44.231
- Been training down in Phoenix.
- Good for him.

17:44.233 --> 17:46.701
It's a real pleasure
to meet you, Officer Shankwitz.

17:46.703 --> 17:49.103
- The newest member of our team.
- Lucky us.

17:49.105 --> 17:52.640
No, Frank, lucky you.

17:52.642 --> 17:54.308
No.

17:56.145 --> 17:58.145
I'd rather take Tom Wells.

18:01.651 --> 18:04.518
Then we had four months
additional academy training.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.520
And that included self-dense,

18:06.522 --> 18:10.124
uh, firearms operations,
first aid,

18:10.126 --> 18:14.628
uh, hostage negotiation,
uh, high speed driving,

18:14.630 --> 18:18.065
traffic control,
crowd management,

18:18.067 --> 18:20.067
and that was all
basic cadet training.

18:20.069 --> 18:21.335
Sorry.

18:21.337 --> 18:24.305
Listen, Junior,
it's tough out there.

18:24.307 --> 18:27.308
Risky, dangerous,
and unpredictable.

18:27.310 --> 18:29.310
But that's enough about me.

18:29.312 --> 18:32.313
You wanna die tonight,
just keep talking.

18:33.349 --> 18:34.682
Yes, sir.

18:34.684 --> 18:36.684
Not another word.

18:36.686 --> 18:39.320
Except that one.

18:39.322 --> 18:41.288
Internal Affairs are gonna
be all over this, Tom.

18:41.290 --> 18:43.457
- It doesn't look good.
- Have you finalized your report yet?

18:43.459 --> 18:46.460
No. Not till I know
what you wanna do.

18:46.462 --> 18:48.562
Well I had kind of a fun idea.

18:48.564 --> 18:50.564
Sounds like you.
Let's hear it.

18:52.435 --> 18:56.704
That male suspect
doesn't know shit

18:56.706 --> 18:58.806
- about what happened.
- What?

18:58.808 --> 19:01.809
Hey, what are you talking about?

19:03.212 --> 19:05.212
Come here.

19:08.718 --> 19:10.718
All right, go.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.720
He and Frank went toe to toe.

19:12.722 --> 19:14.422
- Uh-huh.
- Took a pretty good beatin'.

19:14.424 --> 19:16.424
Got knocked on the head.

19:16.426 --> 19:18.092
As far as he knows,

19:18.094 --> 19:20.361
old Tom here had
nothing to do with it.

19:20.363 --> 19:21.829
Okay.

19:21.831 --> 19:24.832
Why should I cover your ass?

19:24.834 --> 19:26.267
You're not exactly
Mr. Ethical.

19:26.269 --> 19:28.369
I know, but I'm still
your sergeant.

19:28.371 --> 19:31.705
So, give me one good reason why I should
put my ass on the line for you again?

19:31.707 --> 19:33.707
I'll give you
three good reasons.

19:33.709 --> 19:36.077
A, I'm your best guy.

19:36.079 --> 19:39.513
Number two, if I go down,

19:39.515 --> 19:42.516
could be a domino effect.

19:42.518 --> 19:45.386
That's only two reasons.

19:45.388 --> 19:47.388
Yeah, that's all I got,
but I think I made my point.

19:47.390 --> 19:49.256
I get it, okay.

19:49.258 --> 19:51.425
All right, but this little story
of yours better work

19:51.427 --> 19:53.427
or you're shit out of luck.

19:53.429 --> 19:56.130
Now, the broad, she saw it all.

19:56.132 --> 19:58.165
What about her?

19:58.167 --> 20:00.201
That's the fun part.

20:05.508 --> 20:08.509
<i>♪ On the other side ♪</i>

20:35.771 --> 20:37.638
Frank?
Stay in the car.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.507
Keep your hands where I could...
Son of a bitch!

20:39.509 --> 20:41.709
Hey, stop!

20:44.614 --> 20:46.647
Are you okay?
You're not hurt?

20:46.649 --> 20:48.649
- Okay.
- Hang in there, Frank!

20:48.651 --> 20:50.217
Frank? Frank,
is that your name?

20:50.219 --> 20:52.186
Okay, I'm gonna
remove your helmet.

20:52.188 --> 20:54.722
Do not move, I'm taking off
your helmet right now.

20:56.592 --> 20:58.626
All right. Okay.

20:58.628 --> 21:01.795
Get down on the ground.

21:01.797 --> 21:03.564
Uh... okay.

21:08.237 --> 21:10.771
Come on.

21:10.773 --> 21:12.907
- Is he all right?
- He's not breathing.

21:12.909 --> 21:14.775
Come on, Frank!

21:14.777 --> 21:17.778
This is motor 13-33.

21:17.780 --> 21:19.413
I have an officer down.

21:19.415 --> 21:22.483
Motor 10-91 is a 962A.
I need medical assistance

21:22.485 --> 21:24.451
between Parker
and Cienega Springs.

21:24.453 --> 21:26.487
Do you copy?

21:26.489 --> 21:28.489
- Fight.
- Do you copy?

21:28.491 --> 21:30.724
<i>- 10-4, motor 13-33.
- Fight, Frank!</i>

21:30.726 --> 21:32.726
<i>A rescue unit is en route.</i>

21:32.728 --> 21:35.362
Okay, Frank,
this is Mitch Myers.

21:35.364 --> 21:37.598
I need you to hang in there,
help is on its way.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.633
- Do you have anything?
- No.

21:39.635 --> 21:41.635
He's not breathing.

21:41.637 --> 21:43.938
I'm sorry.

21:43.940 --> 21:46.807
I'm so sorry.

21:46.809 --> 21:52.813
963A... motor 10-91 is a 963A.

21:55.518 --> 21:57.518
Frank's gone.

22:12.735 --> 22:14.768
What are you doing?

22:14.770 --> 22:17.638
Get your things
or they'll be left behind.

22:17.640 --> 22:18.839
Where are we going?

22:18.841 --> 22:21.542
- Arizona.
- Why?

22:21.544 --> 22:23.544
It's where I belong.

22:25.381 --> 22:26.714
I wanna stay here.

22:26.716 --> 22:29.717
So you can get
your face smashed in?

22:29.719 --> 22:31.719
Yeah, you really love it here.

22:31.721 --> 22:33.587
I wanna see Dad.

22:33.589 --> 22:35.589
He's coming to pick me up
on Saturday.

22:35.591 --> 22:38.292
- Not anymore.
- Why not?

22:38.294 --> 22:41.795
Your dad wants you back
in Chicago for good.

22:41.797 --> 22:44.965
If we stay here, he'll take you
away from me for good.

22:44.967 --> 22:46.600
I ain't gonna let that happen.

22:46.602 --> 22:48.402
I'm not going.
Dad will come for me.

22:48.404 --> 22:50.404
- Go on, get in the car.
- No.

22:50.406 --> 22:52.373
- Frank, get in the car. Frank.
- No.

22:52.375 --> 22:54.408
No! My hat!
I dropped my hat!

22:54.410 --> 22:55.909
- Frank, come on.
- No!

22:55.911 --> 22:57.611
- No!
- Get in the car!

22:57.613 --> 22:59.046
Get in the car!

22:59.048 --> 23:01.515
No, no!
I'm not going.

23:01.517 --> 23:02.916
Stop it!
Get in the car!

23:02.918 --> 23:04.952
- I'm not...
- Stay in the car!

23:06.856 --> 23:08.856
Stay in the car!

23:18.734 --> 23:21.435
- Wait, you forgot Corky.
- He's not coming.

23:21.437 --> 23:23.604
Can't take him
on the road with us.

23:26.609 --> 23:28.609
Corky, no!

23:28.611 --> 23:29.877
Corky!

23:29.879 --> 23:31.879
Mom, stop, please!

23:31.881 --> 23:34.415
Mom! Mom, stop, I'm sorry!

23:34.417 --> 23:36.016
Whatever I did...
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

23:36.018 --> 23:38.519
Shut up, Frank!
Stop it!

23:38.521 --> 23:43.557
Corky!

23:47.663 --> 23:49.096
He's... He's breathing!

23:49.098 --> 23:51.432
- What?
- He's breathing! He's alive!

23:51.434 --> 23:53.967
Am I in heaven?

23:53.969 --> 23:56.470
No, Frank,
you're in Parker, Arizona.

23:56.472 --> 23:59.740
Why is this angel kissing me?

23:59.742 --> 24:01.909
Don't move, don't move.
Keep your eyes on me.

24:01.911 --> 24:03.410
If you insist.

24:03.412 --> 24:05.112
Do you remember what happened?

24:05.114 --> 24:07.481
Uh... yeah.

24:07.483 --> 24:09.049
I'm still paired
with a damn rookie.

24:14.090 --> 24:16.824
Hey, what are you doing
later tonight?

24:16.826 --> 24:18.692
He's alive!

24:18.694 --> 24:22.396
Motor 10-91 is a 962A!

24:23.799 --> 24:25.799
You had us worried
for a minute there, Frank.

24:25.801 --> 24:27.768
What's your name?

24:27.770 --> 24:29.837
Sally.

24:29.839 --> 24:31.839
Thank you, Sally.

24:31.841 --> 24:34.541
I'm glad it was you.

24:34.543 --> 24:37.644
If he had kissed me,
I don't think I'd come back from that.

24:37.646 --> 24:39.380
Did you get the son of a bitch?

24:39.382 --> 24:41.515
Yeah, he's cuffed to the bike.

24:41.517 --> 24:43.984
Evening, sir.

24:43.986 --> 24:45.953
License and registration,
please.

24:49.859 --> 24:51.925
<i>Dr. Cohen to pathology.</i>

24:51.927 --> 24:53.961
<i>Dr. Cohen to pathology.</i>

24:58.401 --> 24:59.800
You've gotta stay awake, Frank.

24:59.802 --> 25:02.836
Can't have you go into shock.

25:07.843 --> 25:09.410
Excuse me, nurse.

25:09.412 --> 25:11.645
Could you get his doctor for me?

25:11.647 --> 25:13.647
Mm-hmm.

25:13.649 --> 25:17.084
So, uh, how are you holding
up, Frank?

25:17.086 --> 25:19.153
Well, I feel about as good
as I look.

25:19.155 --> 25:20.888
What is it with you?

25:20.890 --> 25:22.723
Always getting beat up.

25:23.859 --> 25:25.526
I guess I like trouble.

25:27.029 --> 25:28.996
Who's the groupie?

25:28.998 --> 25:31.131
Oh, this is Kitty Carlisle.
New secretary.

25:31.133 --> 25:32.933
Just joined us today.

25:32.935 --> 25:34.868
Uh, Frank Shankwitz.

25:34.870 --> 25:37.471
Sometimes prettier,

25:37.473 --> 25:40.007
but always just as charming.

25:40.009 --> 25:42.443
Pleasure's all mine, Frank.

25:42.445 --> 25:45.112
Well, it's quite a grip
you got there, Kitty.

25:45.114 --> 25:47.214
You're gonna fit right in.

25:47.216 --> 25:49.516
Charming and a sense of humor.

25:49.518 --> 25:50.884
Wow, it's like you know me
already.

25:52.922 --> 25:55.456
Well, Doctor.

25:55.458 --> 25:57.224
Good evening, Frank.
I'm Dr. McKinley.

25:57.226 --> 26:00.093
You are lucky to be alive.

26:00.095 --> 26:01.595
You have a skull fracture

26:01.597 --> 26:03.797
and severe bruising
of the brain.

26:03.799 --> 26:05.732
It's gonna be a long road
back for you,

26:05.734 --> 26:07.134
but you'll get there
with plenty of rest.

26:07.136 --> 26:10.537
What are you thinking,
like a few weeks?

26:10.539 --> 26:12.806
More like a few months.

26:12.808 --> 26:15.209
I'm gonna ask you to have someone
come stay with you for a week or two.

26:15.211 --> 26:16.610
Help look after you.

26:16.612 --> 26:17.845
No, I'm fine.

26:17.847 --> 26:19.847
Don't need nobody fussing
over me.

26:19.849 --> 26:22.015
Well, the risk of you going
into shock is very, very high

26:22.017 --> 26:23.116
for the next few days.

26:23.118 --> 26:24.852
Especially at night.

26:24.854 --> 26:26.520
So I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to insist on it.

26:26.522 --> 26:29.923
Kitty, you got
your first assignment.

26:29.925 --> 26:31.492
She's not staying at my house.

26:31.494 --> 26:32.759
I'm not staying at his house.

26:32.761 --> 26:34.962
Not without dinner
and a movie first.

26:34.964 --> 26:37.531
- It's kind of a rule.
- I'm not staying at his house period.

26:37.533 --> 26:41.201
- He's crazy.
- Frank, the sooner you get better,

26:41.203 --> 26:42.669
the sooner you get back to work,

26:42.671 --> 26:44.204
and you heard
what the doctor said.

26:44.206 --> 26:45.939
You need looking after.

26:45.941 --> 26:51.078
And, Kitty, I wanna know
who's doing the looking after.

26:51.080 --> 26:53.080
<i>Ortho tech to pediatrics.</i>

27:05.928 --> 27:07.928
All right, let's see.

27:07.930 --> 27:10.097
Uh, yeah.
Watch this step.

27:10.099 --> 27:11.899
You sure you don't want
these crutches?

27:11.901 --> 27:13.166
I don't need any help.

27:13.168 --> 27:16.169
All right, let's get you set up.

27:16.171 --> 27:19.172
I just want you to rest up
and get better.

27:19.174 --> 27:21.842
Get you back on that horse.

27:21.844 --> 27:23.844
Yeah.

27:23.846 --> 27:27.614
Welcome to Arizona's finest.

27:27.616 --> 27:31.618
Wow, Frank, you didn't have
to tidy up on account of us.

27:31.620 --> 27:33.687
I guess if it doesn't work
as a cop

27:33.689 --> 27:35.856
you can always go
into interior design.

27:35.858 --> 27:37.858
That's funny.
Quick tour.

27:37.860 --> 27:39.726
Liquor cabinet's over there.

27:39.728 --> 27:41.061
Kitchen's through there.

27:41.063 --> 27:42.729
I don't get in there much.

27:42.731 --> 27:45.065
Probably see more action
now Kitty's here.

27:45.067 --> 27:47.000
Can I leave?
This is gonna end badly.

27:47.002 --> 27:49.169
No, no, no, you'll be just fine.

27:49.171 --> 27:51.238
- It's not me I'm worried about.
- Okay, bedroom's through this way.

27:51.240 --> 27:54.241
Probably see a lot less action
now Kitty's here.

27:55.945 --> 27:57.978
- I'm gonna call a cab.
- No, no, no, no.

27:57.980 --> 28:00.247
You're gonna stay right here.
Come on.

28:02.284 --> 28:05.285
Well, let me get you
set up here, Frank.

28:05.287 --> 28:06.954
I want you to rest up.

28:06.956 --> 28:08.956
Okay.

28:08.958 --> 28:11.959
You lie back there.

28:11.961 --> 28:15.228
Now, is there anything
I can get you before I leave?

28:15.230 --> 28:16.930
Yeah.

28:16.932 --> 28:19.800
A bottle of Scotch

28:19.802 --> 28:21.935
and a good cigar
would be great about now.

28:21.937 --> 28:24.037
Well, I'm sorry, Frank,
not gonna happen.

28:24.039 --> 28:27.040
I guess I'll just lay here.

28:27.042 --> 28:28.342
With Kitty.

28:28.344 --> 28:30.210
Yeah, sorry, Frank,
not gonna happen.

28:30.212 --> 28:32.245
Look, Frank, I'll get you
that drink.

28:32.247 --> 28:35.782
As soon as you pay me back
for that bike you wrecked.

28:35.784 --> 28:39.786
Now you two play nice.

28:49.198 --> 28:52.199
Look, if you wanna go,
I'm not gonna stop ya.

28:53.669 --> 28:55.335
I have no intention
of being fired

28:55.337 --> 28:57.004
on my very first assignment.

28:57.006 --> 28:58.305
Thank you.

29:00.342 --> 29:03.677
At the hospital why didn't you
tell Eddie we had already met?

29:03.679 --> 29:07.014
I didn't wanna
have to explain it.

29:07.016 --> 29:08.281
Why didn't you say anything?

29:08.283 --> 29:10.283
When I first saw you there,

29:10.285 --> 29:13.186
my first thought was
why is this man following me?

29:13.188 --> 29:15.122
Well, you know
what I'm thinking?

29:15.124 --> 29:18.759
I'm thinking this pain medicine
is wearing off way too fast.

29:18.761 --> 29:20.394
Can I ask you something?

29:20.396 --> 29:22.329
I know what you're gonna ask me
and the answer is no.

29:22.331 --> 29:24.231
I'm not allowed to date you.

29:24.233 --> 29:27.234
It's against department policy,
and they're very strict.

29:27.236 --> 29:29.836
Well, thank you for helping me
dodge that bullet.

29:29.838 --> 29:32.139
Mm-hmm.

29:32.141 --> 29:35.175
Do you mind if I ask you a
question about your accident?

29:35.177 --> 29:37.411
No.

29:38.447 --> 29:40.881
No, you don't mind

29:40.883 --> 29:42.883
or no, you don't want me to ask?

29:46.822 --> 29:50.824
Eddie said you stopped breathing
for a few minutes.

29:50.826 --> 29:52.159
Is that true?

29:55.164 --> 29:57.164
You know what?

29:57.166 --> 29:59.700
If we're gonna talk, let's...
Let's just talk about you.

29:59.702 --> 30:01.268
Okay?

30:01.270 --> 30:02.469
Are you married?

30:02.471 --> 30:04.938
You're very direct.

30:04.940 --> 30:06.973
Are you a Scorpio?

30:06.975 --> 30:08.375
- What?
- A Scorpio?

30:08.377 --> 30:10.110
- Are you a Scorpio?
- No.

30:10.112 --> 30:11.344
- Leo.
- No.

30:11.346 --> 30:13.080
- Gemini? Taurus.
- No.

30:13.082 --> 30:14.748
- Pisces.
- I knew it.

30:14.750 --> 30:15.982
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

30:15.984 --> 30:18.418
This pain medicine's worn off.

30:18.420 --> 30:21.054
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay.

30:21.056 --> 30:23.056
- Here.
- No, don't. I don't need your help.

30:35.738 --> 30:38.739
Ow!

30:38.741 --> 30:40.440
Damn it.

32:13.202 --> 32:15.202
Frank!

32:26.849 --> 32:28.849
Frank!

32:28.851 --> 32:31.551
Come on, let's go!

32:32.588 --> 32:34.588
Lorraine, you in here?

32:37.025 --> 32:38.325
Frank!

32:38.327 --> 32:40.360
Come on, let's go, Frank!

32:43.165 --> 32:45.165
Corky! Corky!

32:45.167 --> 32:47.033
Atta boy.

32:47.035 --> 32:48.368
Hey, where's Frank?

32:48.370 --> 32:50.370
Where's Frank, buddy?

32:52.374 --> 32:54.374
Frank!

32:55.878 --> 32:57.878
Come on, Corky, come on.

33:04.019 --> 33:07.020
Damn that woman.

33:07.022 --> 33:09.022
Goddamn that woman!

33:35.450 --> 33:39.119
- Sheriff's office.
- My son's been kidnapped.

33:39.121 --> 33:42.155
Uh, uh, what's your name, sir?

33:42.157 --> 33:43.523
Frank Shankwitz.

33:43.525 --> 33:45.425
Uh, how do you spell that?

33:45.427 --> 33:48.094
S-H-A-N-K-W-I-T-Z.

33:48.096 --> 33:50.997
And your son's name?

33:50.999 --> 33:53.934
Uh, same. Frank.
Frank Shankwitz, Jr.

33:53.936 --> 33:55.702
Do you know who took your son?

33:55.704 --> 33:57.103
My wife.

33:57.105 --> 33:58.571
My ex-wife Lorraine.

33:58.573 --> 34:01.474
So, the boy's with his mother.

34:01.476 --> 34:03.176
Yes.

34:03.178 --> 34:05.178
Is that a problem?

34:05.180 --> 34:07.681
We have joint custody.

34:07.683 --> 34:10.050
She ignored a court order
to stay in Chicago.

34:10.052 --> 34:11.451
She took him, and now
she's on the run again.

34:11.453 --> 34:13.353
So, yes, it's a problem.

34:13.355 --> 34:16.156
Well, if the boy's
with his mother

34:16.158 --> 34:18.725
then it's something
for the court

34:18.726 --> 34:20.726
and the Chicago police
to handle.

34:20.728 --> 34:24.496
If you wanna register
your son as missing,

34:24.498 --> 34:27.534
then we can start a search
in 72 hours.

34:27.536 --> 34:29.502
They could be halfway
around the world by then!

34:29.504 --> 34:31.271
Calm down, Mr. Shankwitz.

34:31.273 --> 34:33.273
<i>- Calm down?
- I'm sorry, but that's all...</i>

34:33.275 --> 34:35.275
Just find my son!

34:44.553 --> 34:46.585
Frank!

34:48.123 --> 34:51.491
Frank.

34:51.493 --> 34:53.994
- You're okay.
- Leave it.

34:53.996 --> 34:56.996
- I got it.
- I said leave it!

34:56.998 --> 35:00.467
Nice going,
Florence Nightingale.

35:18.053 --> 35:21.054
Son of a bitch!

35:34.269 --> 35:37.037
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

35:37.039 --> 35:38.471
That's her shitty ass car,

35:38.473 --> 35:41.408
so that must be
her shitty ass house.

35:41.410 --> 35:44.110
Sit tight.

35:44.112 --> 35:46.112
Be right back.

36:28.590 --> 36:31.825
Crazy bitch.

36:46.541 --> 36:48.641
Yeah?

36:48.643 --> 36:50.777
- She's a firecracker, all right.
- Is she gonna be a problem?

36:50.779 --> 36:53.546
No problem, Officer Shankwitz.

36:53.548 --> 36:54.781
No problem at all.

36:54.783 --> 36:57.217
That's what I like to hear.

36:57.219 --> 37:00.186
Let's go.

37:50.238 --> 37:52.739
Damn it!

38:21.903 --> 38:23.903
Frank!

38:29.945 --> 38:31.945
Frank!

38:46.428 --> 38:48.428
Frank!

38:58.573 --> 39:00.573
Frank, what the hell
are you doing?

39:00.575 --> 39:02.342
I'm playing tennis.

39:02.344 --> 39:03.810
What's it look like?

39:03.812 --> 39:06.346
It looks like you need
to get dressed and shave.

39:06.348 --> 39:08.948
- You look like a bum.
- A bum.

39:10.518 --> 39:12.452
Yeah, well you look
like a hooker.

39:14.489 --> 39:16.289
You don't like the way I look?

39:16.291 --> 39:17.657
No, no, it's perfect.

39:17.659 --> 39:19.726
You know, if you wanna earn
a few bucks on the way home.

39:19.728 --> 39:21.728
Get out of here.

39:21.730 --> 39:24.030
You get out of here.

39:24.032 --> 39:26.499
I live here, you're trespassing.

39:26.501 --> 39:29.736
- Get out!
- I'm not going anywhere.

39:31.473 --> 39:33.039
Shoot the bottle.

39:33.041 --> 39:35.875
No way, I'm done.

39:35.877 --> 39:38.811
I wasn't asking.

39:54.562 --> 39:55.762
Told ya.

39:55.764 --> 39:57.764
Waste of damn time.

39:57.766 --> 39:59.732
- Again.
- I said I'm done.

39:59.734 --> 40:01.634
I said again.

40:21.823 --> 40:23.823
Take the shot.

40:34.669 --> 40:36.369
So, who's your date?

40:36.371 --> 40:38.504
What makes you think
I have a date?

40:38.506 --> 40:39.939
You dressed up for me, huh?

40:39.941 --> 40:42.942
Why do you care?

40:42.944 --> 40:44.711
I just wanna know
who's stealing my nurse

40:44.713 --> 40:46.713
so I can arrest them.

40:46.715 --> 40:49.082
I was only assigned
to you for a week.

40:49.084 --> 40:51.751
Why do you keep coming back?

40:57.025 --> 40:58.658
I don't know.

41:00.995 --> 41:03.429
I am gonna be late for my date.

42:02.056 --> 42:04.590
Honey, rise and shine.

42:04.592 --> 42:06.058
Come on, up and at 'em.

42:06.060 --> 42:07.593
I retired.

42:07.595 --> 42:09.061
I don't have
to get up and at 'em.

42:09.063 --> 42:11.197
Well, it's 9:30, you know.

42:11.199 --> 42:12.832
9:30?

42:12.834 --> 42:15.001
Half the day's gone.
Why didn't you wake me?

42:15.003 --> 42:17.103
Just thought I'd let you get
a little beauty sleep.

42:17.105 --> 42:19.005
Beauty?
Look at this face.

42:19.007 --> 42:20.873
I'm already beautiful enough.

42:20.875 --> 42:23.209
I get any more beauty sleep,
I'll be gorgeous.

42:23.211 --> 42:26.012
I'd hurry up and get
downstairs if I were you.

42:26.014 --> 42:28.114
- Why?
- 'Cause if your head got any bigger,

42:28.116 --> 42:30.550
- it wouldn't get through the door.
- Oh.

42:30.552 --> 42:32.552
But it's a cute face.

42:32.554 --> 42:33.820
- Mmm.
- Mm-mm.

42:33.822 --> 42:35.021
- Love you.
- Mm.

43:17.799 --> 43:19.799
I know why you're here, Doc.

43:19.801 --> 43:21.667
There's nothing to talk about.

43:21.669 --> 43:24.704
Well, good afternoon
to you, too, Frank.

43:24.706 --> 43:26.706
Wife and kids are doing fine.

43:26.708 --> 43:28.140
Thanks for asking.

43:28.142 --> 43:30.676
Sorry, Doc,
I just wanna get better

43:30.678 --> 43:32.078
and get back on the horse.

43:32.080 --> 43:33.746
Eddie won't let you
get a haircut

43:33.748 --> 43:36.616
until he knows you
and I have a little talk.

43:36.618 --> 43:38.618
So how 'bout it?

43:40.555 --> 43:42.722
I usually like to pop a few
pain killers right about now.

43:42.724 --> 43:45.525
- You want anything?
- No thanks.

43:45.527 --> 43:46.792
But I'd like
to ask you something.

43:46.794 --> 43:49.762
What's it like
being dead man walking?

43:49.764 --> 43:51.664
I don't ' need to get
into all the deep stuff.

43:51.666 --> 43:54.100
I was in wreck, I survived,
I'm getting better.

43:54.102 --> 43:55.035
It's all you need to know.

43:55.047 --> 43:56.702
Well, there's something
else I need to know.

43:56.704 --> 43:58.604
Why didn't you just stay dead?

43:58.606 --> 44:00.606
What are you talking about?

44:00.608 --> 44:03.276
Your line of work
you see a lot of death.

44:03.278 --> 44:05.144
There's nothing more final,

44:05.146 --> 44:08.247
and yet here you are.

44:08.249 --> 44:10.816
- I don't know, I got lucky I guess.
- Lucky?

44:10.818 --> 44:13.686
Lucky is finding
a four-leaf clover.

44:13.688 --> 44:16.222
You were pronounced dead after
three minutes without a pulse.

44:16.224 --> 44:19.225
You have to do a lot better
than lucky here, Frank.

44:19.227 --> 44:20.660
I don't know why
I didn't stay dead.

44:20.662 --> 44:22.194
You're the doctor, you tell me.

44:22.196 --> 44:24.997
I can't give you the answers
until I know the questions.

44:24.999 --> 44:26.599
I got a question.

44:26.601 --> 44:28.234
Yeah, I got a couple
of damn good questions.

44:28.236 --> 44:30.136
Where's the epiphany?
What's the meaning of life?

44:30.138 --> 44:32.071
'Cause I tell ya, Doc,
all I got out of that night

44:32.073 --> 44:34.340
was a wrecked motorcycle,
the mother of all migraines,

44:34.342 --> 44:35.841
and a nurse
who can't cook for shit.

44:35.843 --> 44:37.710
You don't need an epiphany

44:37.712 --> 44:39.011
or to know the meaning of life.

44:39.013 --> 44:41.013
Maybe you survived the accident

44:41.015 --> 44:42.815
to find the meaning
of your life.

44:46.020 --> 44:48.721
I understand you've been spending
a lot of time over there.

44:48.723 --> 44:51.891
Just, you know, checking in
every now and then.

44:51.893 --> 44:53.893
A few grocery runs, that's all.

44:53.895 --> 44:55.895
You be careful, Kitty.

44:55.897 --> 44:59.699
The world of a cop is a...
crazy place.

44:59.701 --> 45:01.701
So I like to keep things

45:01.703 --> 45:05.037
nice and simple around here.

45:05.039 --> 45:07.273
Distractions are not welcome,

45:07.275 --> 45:10.176
and they won't be tolerated.
Clear?

45:11.212 --> 45:13.212
I can assure you, Sergeant,

45:13.214 --> 45:14.680
there is nothing to worry about.

45:14.682 --> 45:16.215
Arrogant,

45:16.217 --> 45:20.920
stubborn, ego-driven bachelors
are not my thing.

45:20.922 --> 45:23.289
Well, good.

45:23.291 --> 45:24.790
We're good then.

45:24.792 --> 45:26.792
Hey.

45:29.097 --> 45:31.897
John, yes.

45:31.899 --> 45:33.366
It's good to see you, my friend.

45:33.368 --> 45:35.368
Hey, good to see you.

45:35.370 --> 45:38.371
John Foster,
U.S. customs.

45:38.373 --> 45:40.906
Kitty Carlisle, new secretary.

45:40.908 --> 45:43.342
- Nice to meet you, John.
- Nice to meet you.

45:43.344 --> 45:45.811
Now, should I file these now,
or would you like me to come back later?

45:45.813 --> 45:47.046
Oh, no, no, no.

45:47.048 --> 45:48.914
There are no secrets
between John and I.

45:48.916 --> 45:51.050
- We're old buddies.
- Okay.

45:51.052 --> 45:53.085
- Sit down, John.
- Thank you, thank you.

45:54.722 --> 45:57.990
Well, John, been a long time.
What's new?

45:57.992 --> 46:01.761
Well, I have a little request
a little out of the ordinary,

46:01.763 --> 46:03.796
but it is what it is.

46:03.798 --> 46:06.232
Well, got my attention.

46:06.234 --> 46:08.100
Thank you.

46:08.102 --> 46:11.404
So my wife has this friend,
and she has a son named Michael.

46:11.406 --> 46:15.241
He has this obsession with
the television series "CHiPS."

46:17.178 --> 46:19.879
We are well aware
of that around here.

46:19.881 --> 46:22.415
Our motorcycle guys think
they deserve a raise

46:22.417 --> 46:24.450
because of that damn show.

46:24.452 --> 46:26.852
I bet, I bet.

46:26.854 --> 46:28.721
So I was hoping maybe,
you know, he could come over

46:28.723 --> 46:30.990
and see the department,
meet some of the guys,

46:30.992 --> 46:32.892
and see the motorcycles.

46:32.894 --> 46:34.093
Sure, sure.

46:34.095 --> 46:36.095
I think we can handle that.

46:36.097 --> 46:38.064
Why don't you give Kitty
a call next week

46:38.066 --> 46:39.265
and we'll set it up.

46:39.267 --> 46:41.000
Well, that's the problem.

46:41.002 --> 46:43.069
See, Michael, he has leukemia,

46:43.071 --> 46:45.337
and he's not expected
to live more than a week.

46:45.339 --> 46:48.140
Oh, my God.

46:48.142 --> 46:50.176
- Poor kid.
- Yeah.

46:50.178 --> 46:53.379
So, if you could maybe
assign a motor officer

46:53.381 --> 46:56.248
to show him around and help
with the "CHiPS" thing.

46:56.250 --> 46:57.850
Frank should do it.

46:57.852 --> 46:59.885
Uh, sorry to interrupt,

46:59.887 --> 47:01.487
but I think Frank should do it.

47:01.489 --> 47:03.055
Who's Frank?

47:03.057 --> 47:04.890
Yeah, he's one
of our motor officers.

47:04.892 --> 47:06.826
He was in a big wreck
a couple of months ago.

47:06.828 --> 47:08.828
He's not in the best of health

47:08.830 --> 47:10.396
to be dealing
with someone like that.

47:10.398 --> 47:13.132
- Frank can handle it.
- I was talking about the kid.

47:13.134 --> 47:15.301
They've both hit hard times.

47:15.303 --> 47:18.237
Maybe they can find
some common ground there.

47:18.239 --> 47:20.906
Is this about Frank
or is this about Michael?

47:22.777 --> 47:24.477
Maybe both.

47:24.479 --> 47:26.278
You think he'd even wanna do it?

47:26.280 --> 47:28.030
No way, not a chance.

47:28.031 --> 47:29.781
What the hell am I supposed
to say to a a sick kid?

47:29.784 --> 47:31.183
Whatever you would say
to a healthy one.

47:31.185 --> 47:33.185
Is this Eddie's idea
of getting me back to work?

47:33.187 --> 47:35.287
- I told him you would do it.
- You volunteered me.

47:35.289 --> 47:37.523
Why the hell would you do that?

47:37.525 --> 47:39.058
What's the big deal?

47:39.060 --> 47:40.826
You hang out with the kid
for a few hours,

47:40.828 --> 47:42.128
show him your motorcycle,

47:42.130 --> 47:44.764
maybe make a few
age-appropriate jokes.

47:44.766 --> 47:46.332
What are you so afraid of?

47:46.334 --> 47:47.533
I'm not afraid of anything.

47:47.535 --> 47:49.068
Then what is it, tough guy?

47:51.105 --> 47:53.405
Forget it.
I'm not doing it.

47:53.407 --> 47:56.442
You know, that's a shame,

47:56.444 --> 47:58.344
'cause I was really
hoping that Michael

47:58.346 --> 48:00.045
could have
a father figure around

48:00.047 --> 48:01.881
the last week
of his life, but...

48:01.883 --> 48:03.415
I guess not.

48:03.417 --> 48:06.418
I'll find someone else.

48:06.420 --> 48:07.920
Someone strong.

48:07.922 --> 48:11.857
Someone like... Tom Wells.

48:17.799 --> 48:19.365
Wait.

48:22.403 --> 48:24.403
Kitty.

48:29.577 --> 48:31.577
Kitty.

48:37.985 --> 48:40.986
What'd you mean
by father figure?

48:40.988 --> 48:43.255
Well, Michael's
parents split up.

48:43.257 --> 48:44.824
His mom and him moved here,

48:44.826 --> 48:46.826
and his dad is
still in Illinois.

48:46.828 --> 48:48.427
But you're probably right.

48:48.429 --> 48:50.896
I mean, what do you know
about his life?

48:57.939 --> 48:59.972
I'll do it.

49:33.341 --> 49:36.141
Can he walk?
Do we need to help him out of the car?

49:36.143 --> 49:38.077
Maybe we should get a wheelchair.
Do you need anything?

49:38.079 --> 49:39.378
Maybe some Valium for you.

49:39.380 --> 49:41.046
Relax for God's sake.

49:41.048 --> 49:42.982
You're giving me a headache
on top of this migraine.

49:42.984 --> 49:44.350
Which I didn't know
was possible until now.

49:44.352 --> 49:47.453
So just shut up.

49:47.455 --> 49:49.455
Well, that's a negative
on the wheelchair.

49:51.158 --> 49:52.591
Hi, I'm Michael.

49:52.593 --> 49:54.627
- You want some gum?
- Sure.

49:54.629 --> 49:56.195
Thanks, Michael.
I'm Officer Frank.

49:56.197 --> 49:57.529
How would you like to...

49:57.531 --> 49:59.565
- Whoa!
- Sit on the motorcycle?

49:59.567 --> 50:01.967
Hi, I'm Marcy.
Michael's mom.

50:01.969 --> 50:03.235
Officer Frank Shankwitz.

50:03.237 --> 50:05.437
Thank you so much
for doing this.

50:05.439 --> 50:08.274
I haven't seen him this happy
and excited in a very long time.

50:08.276 --> 50:10.609
Well, I haven't seen anyone this
happy to be surrounded by cops.

50:10.611 --> 50:12.111
All his friends
are into superheroes,

50:12.113 --> 50:14.580
but Michael worships you guys.

50:14.582 --> 50:17.082
Yeah, well,
we're just regular heroes.

50:17.084 --> 50:18.584
Whoa!

50:18.586 --> 50:20.486
Those are rad.

50:20.488 --> 50:22.521
Yes, yes, they are.

50:22.523 --> 50:24.356
You can touch it if you like.

50:26.427 --> 50:28.928
Wanna check out the station?

50:28.930 --> 50:30.529
We have something for you.

50:32.566 --> 50:35.301
- Sharp.
- Hey, hey.

50:35.303 --> 50:37.169
Real trooper now.

50:37.171 --> 50:39.171
Whoa.

50:57.525 --> 50:58.372
Ooh.

50:58.384 --> 51:00.960
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have you attention?

51:00.962 --> 51:02.528
I have a special announcement.

51:02.530 --> 51:06.298
It's important that I find
Officer Michael Allen.

51:06.300 --> 51:08.300
That's me!

51:08.302 --> 51:11.236
He's about, oh, this high,
blond hair.

51:11.238 --> 51:13.639
Loves to chew bubble gum.

51:13.641 --> 51:14.630
I'm here.

51:14.642 --> 51:17.643
I have these special
awards to present to him.

51:17.645 --> 51:20.145
It doesn't seem like he's here.

51:20.147 --> 51:22.514
Uh, he must be on duty.

51:22.516 --> 51:24.216
Frank, have you seen him?

51:24.218 --> 51:26.018
No, haven't seen him, Eddie.

51:26.020 --> 51:29.621
- I'm over here!
- Did I hear something?

51:29.623 --> 51:34.126
Officer Michael Allen reporting for duty.

51:34.128 --> 51:36.562
Well, why didn't you say so?

51:36.564 --> 51:39.098
I have these for you.

51:40.601 --> 51:45.404
And every police officer
has their own badge.

51:45.406 --> 51:48.440
So I'm real police officer now?

51:48.442 --> 51:52.344
Well, that is exactly
what you are.

51:52.346 --> 51:53.645
Look, Mom, check it out.

51:55.416 --> 51:57.349
Can I have a word with you,
Frank, real quick?

51:57.351 --> 52:00.085
Yeah.

52:02.256 --> 52:05.457
When you're done here,
you need to head over to Internal Affairs.

52:05.459 --> 52:08.160
- They need to talk to you.
- What do they wanna talk about?

52:10.197 --> 52:12.197
Whole bunch of stuff.

52:16.137 --> 52:18.237
- Bullhead.
- What about it?

52:18.239 --> 52:20.339
Just need to ask you a few
questions about that night.

52:20.341 --> 52:22.674
Well, everything is in my
report, nothing's changed.

52:22.676 --> 52:24.810
We've been contacted
by the suspect's lawyer.

52:24.812 --> 52:26.712
Just wanna make sure
we have all the facts.

52:26.714 --> 52:28.647
We just wanna know what happened.
Nothing to worry about.

52:28.649 --> 52:31.116
I'm not worried.
Fire away.

52:31.118 --> 52:33.152
Well, according to your report,

52:33.154 --> 52:35.154
Officer Wells picked up
your Kel-Lite

52:35.156 --> 52:36.422
when he arrived at the scene.

52:36.424 --> 52:38.290
Mm. What about it?

52:38.292 --> 52:40.793
Well, did you hand him the light
or assist in the attack

52:40.795 --> 52:42.294
on the male suspect in any way?

52:42.296 --> 52:44.296
Did I hand him the light?

52:44.298 --> 52:46.165
You guys met Tom Wells?

52:46.167 --> 52:47.566
Could you please just
answer the question?

52:47.568 --> 52:50.836
No, I did not hand my Kel-Lite
to Tom Wells.

52:53.074 --> 52:55.808
Is there a problem?

52:55.810 --> 52:57.609
According to the suspects,

52:57.611 --> 52:59.378
when he regained consciousness,

52:59.380 --> 53:02.381
you were standing over him
holding a Kel-Lite.

53:02.383 --> 53:05.150
That light was covered in blood
and issued to you.

53:05.152 --> 53:07.319
Could you explain that?

53:07.321 --> 53:08.654
Doesn't look good, Frank.

53:08.656 --> 53:11.356
You know what looks worse?

53:11.358 --> 53:14.827
Is a crazy son of a bitch smashing
in the skull of a handcuffed drunk.

53:14.829 --> 53:16.762
Calm down, Frank,
we're just asking questions

53:16.764 --> 53:19.131
based on the reports and statements
that were filed for this incident.

53:19.133 --> 53:21.133
Here's a statement for ya.

53:21.135 --> 53:22.701
I restrained Tom Wells.

53:22.703 --> 53:24.570
Relieved him of my Kel-Lite.

53:24.572 --> 53:27.239
Which is the only reason
this is a brutality charge

53:27.241 --> 53:28.707
and not a damn murder case!

53:53.901 --> 53:55.701
Hey.

53:55.703 --> 53:57.703
There are three rules at work.

53:57.705 --> 54:00.873
Keep your head down, keep your mouth
shut, and keep smiling.

54:00.875 --> 54:02.875
- You got that?
- Okay, Mom.

54:30.371 --> 54:33.405
Goddamn it, Mr. Baxter.

54:33.407 --> 54:34.873
Creeping up on me like that.

54:34.875 --> 54:36.408
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

54:36.410 --> 54:39.411
I was just admiring
your presentation.

54:39.413 --> 54:42.181
The bed.
Pristine.

54:42.183 --> 54:44.183
Yeah, of course it is.
I did it.

54:44.185 --> 54:47.186
Tell me, Lorraine,
you like working here?

54:47.188 --> 54:48.520
Sure.

54:48.522 --> 54:50.689
I mean, it ain't exactly
The Ritz but...

54:50.691 --> 54:54.660
And you appreciate the opportunity
I've given to you and your boy?

54:54.662 --> 54:57.663
We appreciate it.
Why?

54:59.667 --> 55:02.834
Why don't you show me how much?

55:06.340 --> 55:08.507
No, Mr. Baxter!

55:14.648 --> 55:16.648
Get back here!

55:16.650 --> 55:19.251
You're done in this town!

55:19.253 --> 55:21.253
You hear me, you whore?

55:21.255 --> 55:23.255
Oh. You okay, ma'am?

55:25.292 --> 55:27.292
Who did this to you?

55:31.599 --> 55:33.599
Mr. Baxter.

55:38.639 --> 55:40.639
Go on home, ma'am.

55:53.520 --> 55:56.388
Okay, okay, I need two more meatloafs.

55:56.390 --> 55:58.790
And where's my sausage and eggs?

55:58.792 --> 56:02.294
I think somebody's gonna get
fired today, huh?

56:02.296 --> 56:04.029
<i>How about you, gringito, huh?</i>

56:04.031 --> 56:05.998
- You wanna get fired today?
- No, sir.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.834
What is this? Huh?

56:08.836 --> 56:10.769
You can't even
clean the pot, huh?

56:10.771 --> 56:12.037
Maybe your cook should learn
to cook.

56:12.039 --> 56:14.740
- Hey, what did you say?
- What did you say?

56:14.742 --> 56:17.376
Everything's clean.
Go on, check.

56:17.378 --> 56:19.444
The meatloaf was overcooked,
so it stuck to the pan.

56:19.446 --> 56:21.847
The problem is the cooking,
not the cleaning.

56:21.849 --> 56:25.417
Jose, our diner said
the meatloaf's burnt

56:25.419 --> 56:27.719
and he's not paying for it.

56:29.690 --> 56:31.490
- You're burning my food?
- Jose.

56:31.492 --> 56:33.492
- Yeah, you're burning my food.
- No, Jose.

56:33.494 --> 56:35.727
<i>You're costing me money. You're
throwing my money away, cabrón.</i>

56:35.729 --> 56:38.430
You know what? Both of you get out.
You're fired.

56:38.432 --> 56:39.765
<i>Both of you.
Vamonos vamonos.</i>

57:06.560 --> 57:08.560
You okay?

57:14.601 --> 57:16.601
Have a seat.

57:19.840 --> 57:21.473
What's your name?

57:23.510 --> 57:27.412
Frank.

57:27.414 --> 57:29.414
I'm Juan.

57:29.416 --> 57:32.417
People around here
call me... Juan.

57:34.888 --> 57:36.922
What happened to you?

57:36.924 --> 57:39.925
Doesn't matter.

57:39.927 --> 57:41.960
My mom's gonna kill me.

57:41.962 --> 57:44.429
What are you doing out so late?

57:44.431 --> 57:47.132
I just finished work.

57:47.134 --> 57:49.401
Where do you work?

57:50.437 --> 57:53.438
I'm a dishwasher.

57:53.440 --> 57:55.574
I was a dishwasher at El Torro.

57:56.610 --> 57:59.611
No. No, no, no, no.

57:59.613 --> 58:01.613
That is not a diner.

58:01.615 --> 58:04.616
This is a diner.

58:04.618 --> 58:06.718
It's the Snow Cap.

58:06.720 --> 58:08.854
I built it
with my own two hands.

58:09.890 --> 58:11.890
That's good for you.

58:11.892 --> 58:14.893
Well, maybe good for you, too.

58:16.663 --> 58:17.863
How?

58:17.865 --> 58:20.866
Summer's around the corner.

58:20.868 --> 58:23.935
I can use an extra pair
of hands.

58:23.937 --> 58:25.971
Really?

58:25.973 --> 58:28.573
There's one condition, though.

58:28.575 --> 58:30.142
What?

58:30.144 --> 58:32.778
You have to be able
to tell a joke.

58:40.654 --> 58:42.687
A priest and a rabbi walk
into a bar.

58:42.689 --> 58:45.690
All right, okay.

58:45.692 --> 58:46.992
<i>You start tomorrow, pancho.</i>

58:56.770 --> 58:59.104
Wow!

58:59.106 --> 59:01.773
Look, Mom, it's "CHiPS."

59:13.787 --> 59:14.986
Thank you, Charlie.

59:19.026 --> 59:21.092
Wow! Is that for me?

59:21.094 --> 59:23.695
Well, you are Trooper
Michael Allen, aren't you?

59:23.697 --> 59:25.697
Oh, not... not out here, honey.

59:25.699 --> 59:28.967
Take it inside.

59:30.571 --> 59:32.170
Wow, he's a bundle of energy.

59:32.172 --> 59:34.172
Yeah, reminds me of my
first day at the academy.

59:34.174 --> 59:35.907
More like last week.

59:35.909 --> 59:37.709
- Oh, yeah, you're new?
- Mm.

59:37.711 --> 59:38.944
Hasn't been easy.
Frank's been busting my chops.

59:38.946 --> 59:40.846
We do that for all the rookies.

59:40.848 --> 59:42.848
Don't worry,
I'll be easier on Michael.

59:42.850 --> 59:44.249
Oh, you don't need to do that.

59:44.251 --> 59:45.650
He can handle it.

59:47.554 --> 59:49.788
He's the real deal.

59:49.790 --> 59:51.189
Look at that.

59:51.191 --> 59:52.991
Yeah, when Michael is
feeling well enough,

59:52.993 --> 59:54.192
he takes his motorcycle
down the street

59:54.194 --> 59:56.027
and puts tickets on all the cars

59:56.029 --> 59:57.596
that are parked on the curb.

59:57.598 --> 59:59.264
Maybe we should've parked
in the driveway.

59:59.266 --> 01:00:00.799
He's a cop through and through,
isn't he?

01:00:04.805 --> 01:00:06.671
Can I sit on the motorcycle?

01:00:06.673 --> 01:00:09.274
10-4, Officer.
Come on.

01:00:09.276 --> 01:00:10.775
Pick you up.
All right.

01:00:10.777 --> 01:00:12.777
One, two, three.
Oh, you're heavy.

01:00:12.779 --> 01:00:14.779
Oh, yeah.

01:00:17.718 --> 01:00:19.284
Hello, Arizona.

01:00:19.286 --> 01:00:23.288
This is Officer Michael Allen
reporting for duty.

01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:25.156
<i>Good morning,
Officer Michael.</i>

01:00:25.158 --> 01:00:27.158
<i>I am marking you 10-8.</i>

01:00:29.763 --> 01:00:32.797
Do all police officers
get wings?

01:00:32.799 --> 01:00:35.267
No. These are special.

01:00:35.269 --> 01:00:37.135
Custom made just
for motorcycle cops.

01:00:37.137 --> 01:00:40.038
I've got a highway
patrol motorcycle,

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.273
and I'm a real cop.

01:00:41.275 --> 01:00:42.941
Well, let me see what I can do.

01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:45.076
- Really?
- I'm not making any promises,

01:00:45.078 --> 01:00:47.312
but I promise.

01:00:47.314 --> 01:00:48.847
Promise promise?

01:00:50.884 --> 01:00:52.951
Come with me.

01:00:52.953 --> 01:00:54.953
There's only one way
to make a promise official.

01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:56.955
That's a cowboy's
binding contract.

01:00:56.957 --> 01:00:58.690
What's that?

01:00:58.692 --> 01:01:00.292
You stand on that
side of the fence,

01:01:00.294 --> 01:01:02.294
I stand on this side,

01:01:02.296 --> 01:01:05.297
and now we shake hands.

01:01:05.299 --> 01:01:08.166
I promise you,
I'll get you your wings.

01:01:08.168 --> 01:01:10.168
Thank you, Officer Frank.

01:01:12.005 --> 01:01:13.638
Do you wanna be a police officer

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:17.676
More than anything in the world?

01:01:22.816 --> 01:01:24.983
I wish I didn't have to die.

01:01:29.256 --> 01:01:31.289
That already happened
to me once.

01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:32.958
Really?

01:01:36.063 --> 01:01:38.063
What was it like?

01:01:38.065 --> 01:01:41.232
It was peaceful.

01:01:41.234 --> 01:01:44.235
Nothing to feel scared
or sad about.

01:01:46.273 --> 01:01:48.840
But why did you come back?

01:01:50.877 --> 01:01:52.877
'Cause I had something
important to do.

01:01:52.879 --> 01:01:54.879
What?

01:01:54.881 --> 01:01:56.915
Help you.

01:01:56.917 --> 01:01:59.351
You don't have to do that,
Officer Frank.

01:01:59.353 --> 01:02:01.353
Why not?

01:02:01.355 --> 01:02:05.056
People always feel sorry for me

01:02:05.058 --> 01:02:07.926
and they wanna help me.

01:02:07.928 --> 01:02:11.062
But you don't have to help me,
Officer Frank.

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:16.101
Maybe you're helping me.

01:02:19.673 --> 01:02:22.741
These are the reports and statements
from the Bullhead incident.

01:02:22.743 --> 01:02:26.411
Officer Tom Wells, Sergeant
Mason, the two suspects.

01:02:26.413 --> 01:02:28.079
This one's yours.

01:02:28.081 --> 01:02:30.849
It's the only one
that's pure fabrication.

01:02:30.851 --> 01:02:32.851
What the hell you talking about?

01:02:32.853 --> 01:02:35.186
- Let me see these.
- By all means.

01:02:35.188 --> 01:02:36.821
All four are consistent.

01:02:36.823 --> 01:02:39.057
The same chain of events,
the same story.

01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:40.358
All except yours.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.926
Are you crazy?

01:02:41.928 --> 01:02:43.928
Well, this... this is bullshit!

01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:45.196
Every goddamn word!

01:02:45.198 --> 01:02:47.432
I'm gonna advise you
to be really careful

01:02:47.434 --> 01:02:49.067
with your choice of words.

01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:50.269
It's pretty conclusive, Frank.

01:02:52.305 --> 01:02:54.105
They're trying to set me up.

01:02:54.107 --> 01:02:55.373
You can't see that?

01:02:55.375 --> 01:02:57.075
Our investigation is complete.

01:02:57.077 --> 01:02:59.277
We're gonna submit our findings
to the commander.

01:03:02.015 --> 01:03:03.982
That concludes our meeting.

01:03:05.118 --> 01:03:07.986
Goddamn it!

01:03:07.988 --> 01:03:09.988
You know, you should
probably leave now.

01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:11.990
Before we have to
have you removed.

01:03:14.094 --> 01:03:17.262
Uh, I'm gonna have
to let you go.

01:03:17.264 --> 01:03:18.897
There's somebody here to see me

01:03:18.899 --> 01:03:20.899
and apparently it can't wait.

01:03:20.901 --> 01:03:23.134
Yeah, bye.
I'll get back.

01:03:23.136 --> 01:03:26.137
Well, you wanna talk
or you wanna take a leak?

01:03:26.139 --> 01:03:27.939
You spoken to Mason
or Tom Wells?

01:03:27.941 --> 01:03:30.208
Not today.
What's going on?

01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:31.943
Bullhead.

01:03:31.945 --> 01:03:33.712
They're screwing me, Eddie.

01:03:33.714 --> 01:03:36.214
Internal Affairs
wants my badge and gun.

01:03:36.216 --> 01:03:37.882
You shitting me?

01:03:37.884 --> 01:03:39.451
All right, all right,
now calm down.

01:03:39.453 --> 01:03:41.252
Calm down!

01:03:41.254 --> 01:03:43.888
Sit.

01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:46.224
All right, let's have it.

01:03:52.132 --> 01:03:55.266
We've got a...
You wanted to see me, Sarge?

01:03:55.268 --> 01:03:57.969
Yes, Kitty, please, sit down.

01:03:57.971 --> 01:03:59.504
Sit tight, Frank.

01:03:59.506 --> 01:04:01.005
This involves you, too.

01:04:01.007 --> 01:04:02.373
What does?

01:04:02.375 --> 01:04:05.810
Look, I don't know
what's going on

01:04:05.812 --> 01:04:08.513
between you two,
but what I do know is

01:04:08.515 --> 01:04:10.815
I'm about to make it
a lot easier.

01:04:10.817 --> 01:04:13.351
Wait, what is this?

01:04:13.353 --> 01:04:16.454
Kitty, a position just opened up
down in Tucson,

01:04:16.456 --> 01:04:18.490
and I'm recommending you
for transfer.

01:04:18.492 --> 01:04:20.191
It's better money,

01:04:20.193 --> 01:04:21.926
and it's a great opportunity.

01:04:21.928 --> 01:04:23.995
Look, Eddie, there's nothing
going on between us.

01:04:23.997 --> 01:04:27.031
Kitty, you leave next month.

01:04:27.033 --> 01:04:29.200
Frank, I'll talk to Mason.

01:04:29.202 --> 01:04:31.169
Go.

01:04:31.171 --> 01:04:32.804
Yes?

01:04:32.806 --> 01:04:34.539
No, I can wait.

01:04:42.282 --> 01:04:44.382
So you gonna take the transfer?

01:04:44.384 --> 01:04:46.251
Eddie wasn't asking.

01:04:46.253 --> 01:04:47.819
It's a good thing.

01:04:47.821 --> 01:04:49.821
I mean, I could use the money.

01:04:49.823 --> 01:04:51.156
It works out for you, too.

01:04:51.158 --> 01:04:53.858
I mean, I know I annoy you.

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:57.862
So now, you don't have
to see my face every day.

01:05:30.063 --> 01:05:32.063
Frank.

01:05:34.501 --> 01:05:37.035
Look, that was Michael's doctor.

01:05:37.037 --> 01:05:38.837
He's in a coma.

01:05:38.839 --> 01:05:41.072
Here.

01:05:43.076 --> 01:05:46.277
Go!

01:07:11.131 --> 01:07:12.330
Michael?

01:07:17.704 --> 01:07:21.506
Am I real motorcycle cop now?

01:07:28.982 --> 01:07:31.015
Yes, you are.

01:07:33.653 --> 01:07:36.654
And I'm your partner.

01:07:41.995 --> 01:07:44.195
Oh, Michael.

01:07:44.197 --> 01:07:46.998
Come on.

01:07:53.673 --> 01:07:55.673
Thank you.

01:08:54.768 --> 01:08:56.533
Mason, it's Frank.

01:08:56.536 --> 01:08:57.801
We need to talk.

01:08:57.804 --> 01:08:59.804
Hello?

01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:12.283
<i>- Precinct.
- Yeah, Kathy, it's Frank.</i>

01:09:12.285 --> 01:09:14.118
<i>- Get me Tom Wells.
- He just walked by.</i>

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.120
<i>- One second.
- Yeah, I'll hold.</i>

01:09:18.124 --> 01:09:20.124
<i>- Sorry, Frank, he's not here.
- What?</i>

01:09:20.126 --> 01:09:23.127
You just said he was there.

01:09:30.403 --> 01:09:32.403
- Frank Shankwitz?
- Who wants to know?

01:09:33.773 --> 01:09:35.673
I got something for you.
You've been served.

01:09:35.675 --> 01:09:37.140
What?

01:09:37.143 --> 01:09:38.743
By who?

01:09:38.745 --> 01:09:40.745
You want the shirt off my back?

01:09:40.747 --> 01:09:43.747
Get off my property before I
arrest you for trespassing!

01:09:54.094 --> 01:09:55.860
Where is he?
Mason!

01:09:58.231 --> 01:10:00.565
Oh, Frank. Frank!

01:10:00.567 --> 01:10:02.433
Frank! Frank, no.
What are you doing?

01:10:02.435 --> 01:10:04.435
- What are you doing?
- What is this?

01:10:04.437 --> 01:10:05.837
Looks like a subpoena.

01:10:05.839 --> 01:10:07.338
Now get your filthy
hands off me.

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:09.340
- Get 'em off of me now!
- Frank.

01:10:09.342 --> 01:10:11.209
- Now!
- Get your hands off him.

01:10:11.211 --> 01:10:12.677
- Come here.
- I've been framed

01:10:12.679 --> 01:10:14.545
for what happened in Bullhead

01:10:14.547 --> 01:10:16.647
and now I'm being sued
for a million bucks

01:10:16.649 --> 01:10:19.383
and this piece of shit
is doing nothing about it.

01:10:19.385 --> 01:10:21.552
He's throwing me to the dogs.

01:10:21.554 --> 01:10:23.354
You better start talking, Mason.

01:10:23.356 --> 01:10:25.356
Sure, Eddie, I'll talk.

01:10:25.358 --> 01:10:27.859
Frank, you're
under investigation

01:10:27.861 --> 01:10:30.228
for using excessive force
on a suspect.

01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:33.331
That same suspect is suing you

01:10:33.333 --> 01:10:35.800
for a violation
of his civil rights.

01:10:35.802 --> 01:10:40.171
And this department cannot
and will not help you.

01:10:40.173 --> 01:10:44.175
Now, both of you assholes
get out of my office.

01:10:44.177 --> 01:10:46.844
Get out of my office now.

01:10:53.753 --> 01:10:56.754
Hey, Frank.
How are ya?

01:10:56.756 --> 01:10:58.623
Can you talk for a sec?
Come here.

01:10:58.625 --> 01:11:01.626
- Tom.
- Wanna talk to you for a second, cowboy.

01:11:01.628 --> 01:11:04.629
Haven't seen you around
much lately.

01:11:04.631 --> 01:11:06.197
You're not taking my calls.

01:11:06.199 --> 01:11:08.399
- Yeah.
- But now you wanna talk.

01:11:08.401 --> 01:11:10.835
Sure. Let's talk.

01:11:10.837 --> 01:11:12.837
This is nice and public.
Plenty of witnesses.

01:11:12.839 --> 01:11:14.338
You're sure you wanna help
this asshole?

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.340
- Help me?
- Hey! Frank, Frank, Frank.

01:11:16.342 --> 01:11:18.442
- Stop it, come on.
- What the hell is he talking about?

01:11:18.444 --> 01:11:20.444
Look.
Hey, look at me.

01:11:22.182 --> 01:11:23.381
Do what I say

01:11:23.383 --> 01:11:25.449
and avoid this
termination, okay?

01:11:25.451 --> 01:11:27.919
- Go to hell, Mason.
- Frank, just hear me out.

01:11:27.921 --> 01:11:29.554
Your record is impeccable.

01:11:29.556 --> 01:11:31.923
You're completely clean
with a shitload of awards.

01:11:31.925 --> 01:11:35.226
So making a deal with these guys right
now, it's a walk in the park.

01:11:35.228 --> 01:11:37.628
- Come on.
- I get it.

01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:40.665
I take one for the team
and this prick walks.

01:11:40.667 --> 01:11:43.367
How the fuck is
that a good deal for me?

01:11:43.369 --> 01:11:45.203
Stop, Frank.

01:11:45.205 --> 01:11:47.638
I'm gonna recommend suspension
without pay. I know.

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.941
But it's the only way
these guys will play ball.

01:11:49.943 --> 01:11:51.442
Come on.

01:11:51.444 --> 01:11:52.743
I know it's a blemish
on your record.

01:11:52.745 --> 01:11:54.812
This way the termination
will go away,

01:11:54.814 --> 01:11:57.848
you maintain your job,
and you're back to it before you know it.

01:11:57.850 --> 01:12:00.551
- Come on, man.
- It's either this or termination, Frank.

01:12:00.553 --> 01:12:02.553
It's your call.

01:12:02.555 --> 01:12:04.422
I say I keep my job

01:12:04.424 --> 01:12:06.924
and you two go screw
yourselves and each other.

01:12:06.926 --> 01:12:09.460
Whatever you want. It's your funeral, pal.
We're just trying to help ya.

01:12:09.462 --> 01:12:11.662
Frank, now listen to me.
I want you to hear me out one more time.

01:12:11.664 --> 01:12:13.264
You're finished.
You're an idiot

01:12:13.266 --> 01:12:14.999
and you're finished.
Get out of my sight.

01:12:15.001 --> 01:12:16.400
Get out of my sight.

01:12:18.438 --> 01:12:20.471
<i> What's your next play?</i>

01:12:23.009 --> 01:12:25.476
Get a lawyer or get a new job.

01:12:25.478 --> 01:12:27.278
Do you know any lawyers?

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.280
None I can afford.

01:12:29.282 --> 01:12:32.016
Used up all my sick days
after the accident.

01:12:32.018 --> 01:12:33.451
I'm cleaned out.

01:12:33.453 --> 01:12:34.785
I might be able to help you out.

01:12:34.787 --> 01:12:36.420
I don't want your money.

01:12:36.422 --> 01:12:37.755
No, that's not what I...

01:12:37.757 --> 01:12:39.490
Oh, but if you need
a little I can...

01:12:39.492 --> 01:12:41.325
I said I don't want
your damn money.

01:12:41.327 --> 01:12:42.560
Well, I might know a lawyer.

01:12:42.562 --> 01:12:43.794
Might know is
not much good to me.

01:12:43.796 --> 01:12:45.896
He's a buddy of mine.

01:12:45.898 --> 01:12:46.570
Oh.

01:12:46.582 --> 01:12:48.633
I've known him my whole life.
He's the smartest guy I know.

01:12:48.635 --> 01:12:50.401
He's a buddy of yours,
he can't be that smart.

01:12:50.403 --> 01:12:52.403
What is his name?

01:12:52.405 --> 01:12:53.804
- James Fisher.
- Mm.

01:12:53.806 --> 01:12:55.906
He's a junior
at a law firm in Phoenix.

01:12:55.908 --> 01:12:57.808
Money won't be a problem.

01:12:57.810 --> 01:12:59.777
In fact, he'd probably pay you
just to get his first case.

01:12:59.779 --> 01:13:01.779
His first case?

01:13:04.951 --> 01:13:06.917
You have a better idea?

01:13:07.954 --> 01:13:09.954
Get him on the phone.

01:13:15.561 --> 01:13:19.563
Okay, listen up, everybody.

01:13:19.565 --> 01:13:24.502
In two days Michael Allen
is being buried in Illinois.

01:13:24.504 --> 01:13:27.405
And I'm sending Frank and Mitch
as our representatives

01:13:27.407 --> 01:13:30.808
to honor Michael
as an Arizona trooper.

01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:32.810
Not a good idea, Eddie.

01:13:32.812 --> 01:13:34.378
You got something to say, Mason?

01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.030
Frank's suspended.

01:13:36.031 --> 01:13:37.681
It doesn't look good if he's
the best we got, you know.

01:13:37.684 --> 01:13:38.883
Well, guess what?

01:13:38.885 --> 01:13:40.818
I don't give a shit
what it looks like.

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:43.087
He's still a cop
and he's still going.

01:13:43.089 --> 01:13:45.890
Who are you kidding, Eddie?
He's on borrowed time.

01:13:45.892 --> 01:13:48.025
Look, if you want, we can step
into my office

01:13:48.027 --> 01:13:50.027
and discuss it after this.

01:13:50.029 --> 01:13:51.495
But for now

01:13:51.497 --> 01:13:54.732
I'd like you guys
to pass the hat around

01:13:54.734 --> 01:13:56.100
and anything you can donate

01:13:56.102 --> 01:13:59.637
we would really appreciate it.

01:13:59.639 --> 01:14:03.974
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:14:03.976 --> 01:14:05.976
And thank you.

01:14:05.978 --> 01:14:08.813
Of course, we don't expect
you to give anything

01:14:08.815 --> 01:14:12.383
because we all know
you got deep pockets,

01:14:12.385 --> 01:14:14.418
but you got short arms.

01:14:17.023 --> 01:14:20.091
Thanks, folks.
I'll be here all week.

01:14:43.783 --> 01:14:45.149
Morning, gentlemen.

01:14:45.151 --> 01:14:47.017
Frank Shankwitz,
Arizona Highway Patrol.

01:14:47.019 --> 01:14:48.619
Randy Jackson,
Illinois State Police.

01:14:48.621 --> 01:14:50.821
- Mitch Myers.
- Joe Garcia, Chicago Police.

01:14:50.823 --> 01:14:53.090
Thanks for coming today,
gentlemen.

01:14:53.092 --> 01:14:55.393
Listen, we read about this
in the newspaper

01:14:55.395 --> 01:14:57.661
and we felt obligated.
We need to be here with you.

01:14:57.663 --> 01:14:59.563
It means a lot that you did.

01:14:59.565 --> 01:15:01.565
I could tell ya it'd mean
the world to this young man.

01:15:01.567 --> 01:15:02.967
We're just proud
to be a part of it.

01:15:02.969 --> 01:15:04.802
So are we.

01:15:04.804 --> 01:15:07.171
And if Michael were here,
he'd shake both your hands,

01:15:07.173 --> 01:15:08.939
offer you a piece of gum,
and ask for a ride

01:15:08.941 --> 01:15:11.301
- in your patrol car.
- I think we'd probably give it to him.

01:15:12.578 --> 01:15:14.178
Thanks.

01:15:21.954 --> 01:15:23.988
Frank.

01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:26.490
I'm so glad you could make it.

01:15:30.163 --> 01:15:33.063
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

01:15:33.065 --> 01:15:35.800
Thank you so much
for everything.

01:15:38.938 --> 01:15:41.939
Ready?

01:16:11.571 --> 01:16:13.571
So long, partner.

01:17:07.793 --> 01:17:09.793
Thank you.

01:17:14.534 --> 01:17:16.534
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:17:38.791 --> 01:17:40.958
Frankie.

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.227
What are you doing?

01:17:43.229 --> 01:17:46.196
I'm hungry, Juan.

01:17:46.198 --> 01:17:47.665
I'm so hungry.

01:17:47.667 --> 01:17:50.901
Well, I'll go make you
something.

01:17:50.903 --> 01:17:53.737
Listen to me, you work here now,

01:17:53.739 --> 01:17:56.607
that means you eat here now.

01:17:56.609 --> 01:17:59.276
And real food, not garbage,
you understand?

01:18:00.313 --> 01:18:02.880
I wanna help you.

01:18:02.882 --> 01:18:04.915
And it's okay for you
to accept my help.

01:18:04.917 --> 01:18:08.752
'cause when people need help
you give it to them.

01:18:10.823 --> 01:18:13.724
But how?
I'm just a kid.

01:18:13.726 --> 01:18:16.927
You're not just anything.

01:18:16.929 --> 01:18:20.097
You're Frank Shankwitz.

01:18:20.099 --> 01:18:22.833
And you could help people.

01:18:25.871 --> 01:18:30.174
Remember, if someone needs help

01:18:30.176 --> 01:18:32.977
you give it to them.

01:18:32.979 --> 01:18:34.979
Hmm?

01:18:34.981 --> 01:18:36.747
Yeah.

01:19:54.226 --> 01:19:56.694
Frank!

01:19:56.696 --> 01:19:58.462
Honey! What happened?

01:19:58.464 --> 01:20:00.164
What broke?

01:20:00.166 --> 01:20:02.166
Frank, have you lost
your marbles again?

01:20:02.168 --> 01:20:05.102
I'm looking for that
magnifying glass.

01:20:05.104 --> 01:20:06.837
We have a magnifying glass?

01:20:18.217 --> 01:20:20.217
I think I found my son.

01:20:26.392 --> 01:20:27.925
Department of Public Safety.

01:20:27.927 --> 01:20:30.060
Good morning,
this is Frank Shankwitz.

01:20:30.062 --> 01:20:31.495
Frank, it's Kitty.

01:20:31.497 --> 01:20:33.397
Why are you introducing
yourself? It's weird.

01:20:33.399 --> 01:20:35.199
Well, just being polite.

01:20:35.201 --> 01:20:37.201
Well, that's a first.

01:20:37.203 --> 01:20:39.503
<i>I think we have our
wires crossed here.</i>

01:20:39.505 --> 01:20:41.972
Uh, my name is Frank Shankwitz,

01:20:41.974 --> 01:20:47.044
and I believe that my son Frank
Shankwitz, Jr is a police officer there.

01:20:47.046 --> 01:20:49.113
Why, yes, of course.
I'm so sorry.

01:20:49.115 --> 01:20:51.482
<i>Frank is one of our highway
patrol officers.</i>

01:20:51.484 --> 01:20:53.317
Um, he's actually not here
right now.

01:20:53.319 --> 01:20:54.518
He's in Illinois.

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.953
Well, that's why I'm calling.

01:20:55.955 --> 01:20:57.154
See, I live in Chicago

01:20:57.156 --> 01:20:58.522
<i>and I read in the paper</i>

01:20:58.524 --> 01:21:00.758
about this little boy
and it said

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:03.026
that Frank was gonna be
at his funeral today.

01:21:03.028 --> 01:21:05.028
<i>In Kewanee.</i>

01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:07.831
Yeah, he's... he's actually
there right now.

01:21:07.833 --> 01:21:09.266
You know what?

01:21:09.268 --> 01:21:11.535
<i>Why don't I take down
your address</i>

01:21:11.537 --> 01:21:14.271
and phone number and I will
pass them along to him.

01:21:14.273 --> 01:21:16.193
He should be checking in
with us some time today.

01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:19.309
Thank you, Kitty.

01:21:19.311 --> 01:21:21.011
Thank you.

01:21:21.013 --> 01:21:22.479
Can I ask you something?

01:21:22.481 --> 01:21:24.014
Anything.

01:21:26.051 --> 01:21:27.518
What's he like?

01:21:53.212 --> 01:21:54.845
Good afternoon.

01:21:54.847 --> 01:21:56.547
Is it?

01:21:58.584 --> 01:22:00.450
Uh, James Fisher.

01:22:00.452 --> 01:22:01.919
We spoke on the phone.

01:22:01.921 --> 01:22:04.121
You must be Clover.

01:22:04.123 --> 01:22:06.123
Last time I checked.

01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:12.062
Are you coming in or what?

01:22:16.101 --> 01:22:17.968
Will I need my attorney here
or...

01:22:17.970 --> 01:22:20.304
No, that won't be necessary.

01:22:20.306 --> 01:22:21.972
All I need is your account

01:22:21.974 --> 01:22:24.308
of the night you were arrested
up at Bullhead.

01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:26.844
I went over all this
with the cops.

01:22:26.846 --> 01:22:30.180
This won't take long.
I... I promise.

01:22:30.182 --> 01:22:34.218
I was out drinking
with my boyfriend.

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:36.253
We smoked a little pot.

01:22:36.255 --> 01:22:38.956
He passed out
on the way home and...

01:22:38.958 --> 01:22:40.958
I had some fun with the cops.

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:44.061
And what happened
when you were pulled over?

01:22:44.063 --> 01:22:47.197
I got into a fight with
a cop and got arrested.

01:22:47.199 --> 01:22:48.398
So what?

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:51.401
So what... what did he look like?

01:22:51.403 --> 01:22:55.939
Big guy, dressed like a cop.

01:22:57.910 --> 01:23:00.210
Can you be more specific?

01:23:00.212 --> 01:23:02.212
Height, weight.

01:23:02.214 --> 01:23:05.549
Yeah, yeah, uh, maybe 6'2, 6'3,

01:23:05.551 --> 01:23:07.417
weighed about 220.

01:23:07.419 --> 01:23:11.622
And what happened
to your boyfriend?

01:23:11.624 --> 01:23:15.325
Apparently he was beaten
so badly, he almost died.

01:23:15.327 --> 01:23:19.463
Another pig turned up and beat
Ziggy with a flashlight.

01:23:19.465 --> 01:23:21.899
Can you describe that officer?

01:23:21.901 --> 01:23:24.401
Shorter.

01:23:24.403 --> 01:23:28.338
About 5'8, 150, 160 pounds.

01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:32.576
Black hair,
little psycho weasel.

01:23:32.578 --> 01:23:34.578
You know his name by any chance?

01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:37.581
The name was Fred or something.

01:23:38.584 --> 01:23:40.584
Frank?

01:23:40.586 --> 01:23:42.586
Yeah, Frank.

01:23:42.588 --> 01:23:44.187
And a funny last name.

01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:48.191
I wanna say...
Sandwich?

01:23:49.194 --> 01:23:51.228
Maybe I'm just hungry.

01:23:51.230 --> 01:23:53.063
Shankwitz?

01:23:53.065 --> 01:23:55.065
Yes.

01:23:55.067 --> 01:23:58.001
Frank Shankwitz.
Do you know him?

01:23:58.003 --> 01:24:00.337
Uh, I've heard of him.

01:24:00.339 --> 01:24:01.939
How do you know
that was his name?

01:24:01.941 --> 01:24:03.540
Another cop told me.

01:24:03.542 --> 01:24:06.376
Police sergeant came here
to the house a few weeks ago.

01:24:06.378 --> 01:24:09.112
He was there, too,
that night up at Bullhead.

01:24:11.417 --> 01:24:12.683
What's so funny?

01:24:13.719 --> 01:24:15.719
Oh, nothing.

01:24:15.721 --> 01:24:18.388
Uh, the... the police officer

01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:21.358
that arrested you,
what color hair did he have?

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:24.461
Brown hair, brown moustache.

01:24:24.463 --> 01:24:26.029
Do you know his name?

01:24:26.031 --> 01:24:29.333
I don't know.

01:24:29.335 --> 01:24:31.368
Who cares? You know,
it's the little shit

01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:33.603
you need to lock up.

01:24:33.605 --> 01:24:36.340
So, to clarify,

01:24:36.342 --> 01:24:40.310
the police officer who beat
and nearly killed your boyfriend

01:24:40.312 --> 01:24:44.181
was about 5'8, black hair,
no moustache

01:24:44.183 --> 01:24:47.451
and his name was
Frank Shankwitz.

01:24:47.453 --> 01:24:49.987
Is there an echo in here?

01:24:49.989 --> 01:24:51.989
Yes! Yes!

01:24:56.362 --> 01:24:58.295
That's the cop who arrested us.

01:25:01.667 --> 01:25:03.066
That's him.

01:25:03.068 --> 01:25:05.569
He beat Ziggy's ass.

01:25:08.774 --> 01:25:11.208
Would you be willing to sign
this as testimony against him?

01:25:11.210 --> 01:25:13.176
Hell, yeah!

01:25:13.178 --> 01:25:15.178
Got a pen?

01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:17.381
Yeah.

01:25:17.383 --> 01:25:19.383
Okay.

01:25:25.491 --> 01:25:27.724
So what's going on
with you and Kitty?

01:25:27.726 --> 01:25:30.093
Nothing.

01:25:30.095 --> 01:25:31.495
She's moving to Tucson.

01:25:31.497 --> 01:25:35.665
Is it true Eddie let her go
because you two were...

01:25:35.667 --> 01:25:37.100
you know?

01:25:37.102 --> 01:25:38.535
Who told you that?

01:25:38.537 --> 01:25:40.537
Everyone in the department.

01:25:40.539 --> 01:25:42.506
Yeah, well everyone
in the department is wrong.

01:25:42.508 --> 01:25:44.508
She got a promotion,
end of story.

01:25:47.479 --> 01:25:49.513
So why'd you drag me
out here then?

01:25:49.515 --> 01:25:51.515
What is this place?

01:25:53.485 --> 01:25:54.718
It's nothing.

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.454
It's nothing good.

01:25:57.456 --> 01:26:00.090
Well, why don't we go
back to the hotel?

01:26:00.092 --> 01:26:02.426
We should check back in
with the department.

01:26:02.428 --> 01:26:04.094
Confirm our flights
for tomorrow.

01:26:04.096 --> 01:26:06.096
We know what time
we're flying out.

01:26:06.098 --> 01:26:08.265
A few beers
and a bottle of scotch.

01:26:08.267 --> 01:26:09.499
That's what I'm doing tonight.

01:26:09.501 --> 01:26:12.102
I would actually like
to see Chicago.

01:26:12.104 --> 01:26:13.703
It's my first time up here.

01:26:13.705 --> 01:26:16.540
- How about you?
- I was born in Chicago.

01:26:16.542 --> 01:26:18.275
No way.

01:26:18.277 --> 01:26:20.777
Then you can show me
around, huh?

01:26:20.779 --> 01:26:24.247
I really don't feel like doing the
whole tourist thing tonight, Mitch.

01:26:24.249 --> 01:26:26.416
If it's not a bar,
I don't wanna know about it.

01:26:26.418 --> 01:26:29.719
Wait, how did you end up
in Arizona?

01:26:29.721 --> 01:26:32.722
My mother had a thing
for cowboys.

01:26:32.724 --> 01:26:36.193
Where do you call home?

01:26:36.195 --> 01:26:38.228
My home's in Arizona.

01:26:38.230 --> 01:26:41.231
And my heart's still here.

01:26:55.647 --> 01:26:58.648
I failed you, Frank.

01:26:58.650 --> 01:27:01.118
You're 11 years old

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:04.121
and you make more money than me.

01:27:04.123 --> 01:27:05.889
I just keep letting you down.

01:27:05.891 --> 01:27:07.858
Why don't we go back to Chicago?

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:09.259
Dad can help.

01:27:09.261 --> 01:27:12.262
He'll look after us.

01:27:14.433 --> 01:27:16.433
No, he can't.

01:27:17.836 --> 01:27:19.536
Do you remember
your father's sister?

01:27:19.538 --> 01:27:21.538
Auntie Linda.

01:27:23.442 --> 01:27:27.444
I got this letter from her
a few weeks ago.

01:27:29.148 --> 01:27:31.148
Your father found us.

01:27:33.252 --> 01:27:34.751
Dad found us?

01:27:34.753 --> 01:27:36.286
He's coming here?

01:27:42.327 --> 01:27:44.761
He was driving down here

01:27:44.763 --> 01:27:48.765
and it was raining hard

01:27:48.767 --> 01:27:52.769
and he got into an accident.

01:27:52.771 --> 01:27:55.772
He didn't make it.

01:27:57.809 --> 01:28:00.810
I'm so sorry.

01:28:04.716 --> 01:28:08.718
Look, I want you
to live with Juan now.

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:10.887
You'll have a much better life

01:28:10.889 --> 01:28:12.756
without me around
to mess things up.

01:28:12.758 --> 01:28:15.525
I promise you.

01:28:15.527 --> 01:28:17.527
I promise.

01:28:19.531 --> 01:28:23.533
You're gonna be fine.

01:28:41.753 --> 01:28:43.753
You okay?

01:28:45.624 --> 01:28:47.624
Just drive.
Just drive.

01:28:47.626 --> 01:28:49.626
Just drive.

01:29:43.582 --> 01:29:45.582
It's okay.

01:29:45.584 --> 01:29:47.584
It's gonna be okay.

01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:10.674
- Frank?
- Mitch.

01:30:10.676 --> 01:30:12.542
Kitty. Where's Frank?

01:30:12.544 --> 01:30:14.577
- At the bar.
- Go get him.

01:30:14.579 --> 01:30:16.579
- No way
- Why not?

01:30:16.581 --> 01:30:18.782
- He's drinking.
- So?

01:30:20.552 --> 01:30:23.586
Imagine trying to take a ham
sandwich from a hobo.

01:30:23.588 --> 01:30:25.822
Tell him it's urgent
police business.

01:30:25.824 --> 01:30:28.058
It's urgent police business.

01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:29.759
My suspension hearing
is pending.

01:30:29.761 --> 01:30:32.662
Not my problem.

01:30:32.664 --> 01:30:34.564
Suspension hearing pending,
not his problem.

01:30:34.566 --> 01:30:35.999
Stubborn son of a bitch.

01:30:36.001 --> 01:30:37.701
I'm just telling you
what he said!

01:30:37.703 --> 01:30:39.102
Not you, him.

01:30:39.104 --> 01:30:40.870
Oh.

01:30:40.872 --> 01:30:42.839
Look, can't this wait?
Like, what is so important?

01:30:42.841 --> 01:30:47.410
Mitch, I need you to get a pen
and write down this address.

01:30:47.412 --> 01:30:48.945
<i>- And I need you to make sure...
- Hey.</i>

01:30:48.947 --> 01:30:51.081
That Frank gets there tonight.

01:30:51.083 --> 01:30:52.615
Wait, what's at this address?

01:30:52.617 --> 01:30:54.351
You will see when you get there.

01:30:54.353 --> 01:30:56.353
Hey, why the big secret?
He's not gonna go anywhere

01:30:56.355 --> 01:30:57.721
unless I tell him
where we're going.

01:30:57.723 --> 01:31:01.725
Tell him he has to go.

01:31:01.727 --> 01:31:03.493
His life depends on it.

01:31:03.495 --> 01:31:05.495
You ready to go?

01:31:05.497 --> 01:31:06.863
Go where?

01:31:06.865 --> 01:31:08.865
The best goddamn bar in Chicago.

01:31:08.867 --> 01:31:11.868
Got the address right here.

01:31:16.108 --> 01:31:18.007
It's a house.

01:31:18.009 --> 01:31:21.010
Well, this is the right address.

01:31:21.012 --> 01:31:24.013
Maybe bars are different
in Chicago.

01:31:24.015 --> 01:31:26.015
Where'd you get that?

01:31:27.819 --> 01:31:29.419
Kitty.

01:31:29.421 --> 01:31:30.754
Kitty?

01:31:30.756 --> 01:31:32.622
How does she know
the best bar in Chicago?

01:31:32.624 --> 01:31:35.625
She just told us
we had to come here.

01:31:37.929 --> 01:31:40.930
Waste of time dragging me
all the way out here.

01:31:40.932 --> 01:31:42.399
I'm heading back.

01:31:42.401 --> 01:31:44.634
Your life depends on it.

01:31:51.576 --> 01:31:53.610
What'd you just say?

01:31:53.612 --> 01:31:56.746
Kitty told me to say that.

01:32:00.786 --> 01:32:03.787
Whatever this place is,
they better have good scotch.

01:32:06.558 --> 01:32:08.425
Why'd you listen to her anyway?

01:32:08.427 --> 01:32:09.759
She'll be in Tucson
this time next week.

01:32:09.761 --> 01:32:12.495
You know that?
Damn filly is leaving us.

01:32:13.532 --> 01:32:15.799
Come on, open up!

01:32:16.835 --> 01:32:19.669
We want scotch!

01:32:44.463 --> 01:32:46.463
Frankie?

01:33:22.934 --> 01:33:25.568
Why didn't you ever come
find me?

01:33:27.606 --> 01:33:29.539
I gotta show you something.

01:33:38.083 --> 01:33:39.782
Here you are.
Look.

01:33:39.784 --> 01:33:42.785
For years I tried everything.

01:33:42.787 --> 01:33:45.788
Every...
Everything at my disposal.

01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:49.692
The police and the private
investigators, newspapers.

01:33:49.694 --> 01:33:53.696
It's just like you and your mother
fell off the face of the earth.

01:33:53.698 --> 01:33:56.065
And I couldn't find you.

01:33:56.067 --> 01:34:00.203
Arizona?

01:34:00.205 --> 01:34:03.072
I am so sorry.

01:34:04.943 --> 01:34:10.780
I stayed in Chicago in case
you would try and find me.

01:34:13.818 --> 01:34:16.686
Mom told me you died
in a car crash.

01:34:18.723 --> 01:34:19.956
What?

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:30.166
Damn that woman.

01:34:34.573 --> 01:34:37.707
She took you away from me.

01:34:39.744 --> 01:34:42.745
Now a little boy named Michael

01:34:42.747 --> 01:34:46.249
brought me back to you.

01:34:46.251 --> 01:34:48.251
Yeah.

01:34:50.255 --> 01:34:51.654
How'd you get so big?

01:34:51.656 --> 01:34:53.323
Chocolate.

01:34:53.325 --> 01:34:56.326
Chocolate.

01:34:56.328 --> 01:34:59.228
Chocolate.

01:35:02.267 --> 01:35:04.167
I have something for you.

01:35:11.142 --> 01:35:14.744
You know from... from now on

01:35:14.746 --> 01:35:17.146
I'll always be with you, son.

01:35:26.625 --> 01:35:28.791
You always were, Pop.

01:35:31.730 --> 01:35:32.929
Hmm?

01:35:47.946 --> 01:35:49.946
The prodigal son has returned.

01:35:49.948 --> 01:35:51.414
Good to see ya, Mitchy.

01:35:51.416 --> 01:35:53.282
Good to see you.

01:35:53.284 --> 01:35:55.284
- Come on through, buddy.
- Thanks.

01:35:58.990 --> 01:36:00.423
Frank?

01:36:00.425 --> 01:36:01.958
James Fisher, this is Frank...

01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:03.292
No need for the formalities.

01:36:03.294 --> 01:36:05.294
James, it's a pleasure.
Take a seat.

01:36:05.296 --> 01:36:07.296
Can I get you anything to drink?

01:36:07.298 --> 01:36:08.731
Cigar?

01:36:08.733 --> 01:36:11.367
Uh, maybe later.

01:36:11.369 --> 01:36:15.004
So, what'd she say?

01:36:15.006 --> 01:36:18.007
Well, Frank, it's like this.

01:36:18.009 --> 01:36:20.009
That night up at Bullhead

01:36:20.011 --> 01:36:23.046
unless you were 5'8 with
black hair and no moustache,

01:36:23.048 --> 01:36:26.449
I'd say you're in the clear.

01:36:29.954 --> 01:36:31.988
Good job!

01:36:33.958 --> 01:36:35.925
I could kiss ya!

01:36:35.927 --> 01:36:37.260
Maybe I'll just take that drink.

01:36:54.312 --> 01:36:56.312
Two questions.

01:36:56.314 --> 01:36:58.715
Why aren't you in Tucson?

01:36:58.717 --> 01:37:01.818
And how the hell
did you get in my house?

01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:04.120
Make me a drink
and I'll tell you.

01:37:04.122 --> 01:37:07.256
Maybe I'll just put you
in cuffs.

01:37:07.258 --> 01:37:10.059
Are you arresting me, Officer?

01:37:10.061 --> 01:37:11.260
On what charge?

01:37:11.262 --> 01:37:14.797
Breaking and entering.

01:37:14.799 --> 01:37:18.401
Okay, well that would be the
illegal entry into a building

01:37:18.403 --> 01:37:20.503
with the purpose
of committing an offense.

01:37:20.505 --> 01:37:22.138
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:25.074
But see, I haven't
committed an offense.

01:37:25.076 --> 01:37:27.110
- Yet.
- Mm.

01:37:27.112 --> 01:37:30.046
Trespassing on private property?

01:37:30.048 --> 01:37:33.082
The honor of this property
actually gave me key.

01:37:33.084 --> 01:37:34.884
- Back when I was his nurse.
- Oh.

01:37:34.886 --> 01:37:38.087
So, you'll have
to take it up with him.

01:37:38.089 --> 01:37:41.891
Well, I mean,
perhaps you could persuade him

01:37:41.893 --> 01:37:43.526
to drop the charges.

01:37:43.528 --> 01:37:45.528
Hmm.

01:37:52.036 --> 01:37:54.470
Yeah.

01:37:54.472 --> 01:37:56.773
The answer is yes, by the way.

01:37:56.775 --> 01:37:58.074
What's the question?

01:37:58.076 --> 01:38:00.209
Do you wanna stay the night?

01:38:00.211 --> 01:38:02.779
Hey, uh, do you wanna
stay the night?

01:38:02.781 --> 01:38:05.181
No thanks.

01:38:07.218 --> 01:38:09.051
I'm not that kinda girl.

01:38:14.325 --> 01:38:16.325
I'm not going to Tucson.

01:38:16.327 --> 01:38:20.062
Why not?

01:38:20.064 --> 01:38:22.098
I'm not going anywhere.

01:38:43.454 --> 01:38:45.388
Come on, come on, come on,
come on.

01:38:47.492 --> 01:38:51.327
Hey, come on.
Go, go, go, move, move, move.

01:38:51.329 --> 01:38:53.896
You stupid loser.

01:38:53.898 --> 01:38:55.131
What did you say?

01:38:55.133 --> 01:38:56.899
What did you say to me?

01:38:59.103 --> 01:39:01.170
Oh, hey, Mason.

01:39:01.172 --> 01:39:04.974
Congratulations
on your early retirement, huh.

01:39:04.976 --> 01:39:07.610
Screw you, Eddie.

01:39:07.612 --> 01:39:10.112
Let's give him
a round of applause, boys.

01:39:15.954 --> 01:39:18.921
Thank you for all being here
tonight.

01:39:18.923 --> 01:39:22.124
After what has been a very
difficult year for all of us,

01:39:22.126 --> 01:39:23.926
it's nice to come together

01:39:23.928 --> 01:39:28.564
to honor someone's years
of good service.

01:39:28.566 --> 01:39:32.435
We're here to celebrate
not only Frank's promotion,

01:39:32.437 --> 01:39:37.106
but to welcome him back
after clearing his good name.

01:39:37.108 --> 01:39:41.644
So, um, without further adieu,
I think we need to hear

01:39:41.646 --> 01:39:47.416
from the man of the hour,
Detective Frank Shankwitz.

01:39:47.418 --> 01:39:49.886
- Here's to you, Frank.
- Well, I'd like to say to that,

01:39:49.888 --> 01:39:51.621
- thank you, Sarge.
- Mm-hmm.

01:39:51.623 --> 01:39:55.124
Now, it's nice to think
that you're all here for me.

01:39:55.126 --> 01:39:58.895
But then I remembered
it's an open bar, so...

01:39:58.897 --> 01:40:02.131
Now I'm not a man for speeches,
but I got the floor,

01:40:02.133 --> 01:40:04.433
so I might as well
say something.

01:40:04.435 --> 01:40:10.339
Now, I've been a fighter
all my life.

01:40:10.341 --> 01:40:14.944
And I'm tired of not knowing
what to fight for.

01:40:16.948 --> 01:40:19.582
Ever since I was a kid,
I've always been on my own.

01:40:21.352 --> 01:40:26.422
You know, I never had any reason
to care about anyone else.

01:40:26.424 --> 01:40:29.525
Until now.

01:40:29.527 --> 01:40:32.695
But now I'm at a crossroads
in my life,

01:40:32.697 --> 01:40:34.697
and I'm choosing which path
to take.

01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:40.403
This year, I met a young man

01:40:40.405 --> 01:40:45.141
who taught me what it is
to be brave.

01:40:45.143 --> 01:40:47.243
And I was not expecting that.

01:40:51.082 --> 01:40:55.484
Being special to someone
was never something that, uh,

01:40:55.486 --> 01:40:59.288
I was used to.

01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:01.724
But Michael,

01:41:01.726 --> 01:41:04.026
well, Michael thought
I was a hero.

01:41:06.297 --> 01:41:10.533
Now, if I can do it,
anyone can be a hero.

01:41:13.671 --> 01:41:17.073
I'm looking for a new path.

01:41:17.075 --> 01:41:19.675
A new path of hope,

01:41:19.677 --> 01:41:23.612
dreams, and everything
that's good in this world.

01:41:27.652 --> 01:41:31.554
A great man once told me
that if somebody needs help,

01:41:31.556 --> 01:41:33.589
give it to them.

01:41:33.591 --> 01:41:37.059
Now, I never thought
that I could make a difference.

01:41:37.061 --> 01:41:38.461
I was wrong.

01:41:38.463 --> 01:41:41.063
I've seen it.

01:41:41.065 --> 01:41:45.267
A simple act of kindness
can have a ripple effect.

01:41:45.269 --> 01:41:47.203
And we helped Michael.

01:41:47.205 --> 01:41:50.740
And now, with your support,
we can help other kids

01:41:50.742 --> 01:41:55.144
all over the world,
one wish at a time.

01:41:55.146 --> 01:41:57.246
'Cause I'm starting
a non-profit.

01:41:57.248 --> 01:42:00.383
What? Now... now, wa...
Are you quitting, Frank?

01:42:00.385 --> 01:42:02.451
You shitting me?
I just made detective.

01:42:02.453 --> 01:42:04.353
Well, good.

01:42:04.355 --> 01:42:07.390
I just found something new
to fight for.

01:42:07.392 --> 01:42:09.258
Here is my idea.

01:42:09.260 --> 01:42:12.461
We create a foundation
that acts like a kinda genie.

01:42:12.463 --> 01:42:15.531
We find other kids like Michael.

01:42:15.533 --> 01:42:20.369
They tell us their wish
and we make them come true.

01:42:20.371 --> 01:42:22.671
Now, even if it's just
for one day,

01:42:22.673 --> 01:42:27.243
I'll be damned if we don't
give them a day of their lives.

01:42:27.245 --> 01:42:30.246
Now, according to Arizona
corporation commission,

01:42:30.248 --> 01:42:33.649
we need five members
to make this happen.

01:42:33.651 --> 01:42:36.619
That's my signature at the top.

01:42:36.621 --> 01:42:38.154
Who's with me?

01:42:46.664 --> 01:42:47.664
Who's that?

01:42:51.102 --> 01:42:53.202
Oh, my.

01:42:53.204 --> 01:42:54.503
No.

01:42:54.505 --> 01:42:56.439
Come here.

01:42:59.444 --> 01:43:01.243
Wow.

01:43:01.245 --> 01:43:03.579
So, what are you gonna call it?

01:43:23.134 --> 01:43:24.533
Bye-bye.

01:43:24.535 --> 01:43:27.736
Hello? Uh, yes,
can you just give me one minute?

01:43:27.738 --> 01:43:30.239
Hello? Yes.

01:43:30.241 --> 01:43:32.174
Go.
Yeah, uh-huh.

01:43:32.176 --> 01:43:33.930
Yeah, we will be right with
you, absolutely.

01:43:36.848 --> 01:43:40.583
Frank Shankwitz, go ahead.

01:43:40.585 --> 01:43:42.284
Make a wish.
