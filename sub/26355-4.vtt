(barking)

00:40.124 --> 00:41.925
-Whoa, whoa, easy, boy, easy.
-(growling)

00:41.958 --> 00:44.528
I-It's just Stewie
in a kitty costume.

00:44.561 --> 00:47.097
I'm a calico,
and my name is Humphrey.

00:47.131 --> 00:49.199
He got his face painted
at a birthday party.

00:49.233 --> 00:51.368
It was the only thing
this little guy could do.

00:51.401 --> 00:53.203
He was too light
for the caterpillar slide,

00:53.237 --> 00:54.738
too short for the piñata,

00:54.771 --> 00:57.207
and too scared to touch
the animals in the petting zoo.

00:57.241 --> 00:59.409
-Half of them had erections.
-Half of them had erections.

00:59.443 --> 01:00.744
The pony was magnificent.

01:00.777 --> 01:03.947
The pony was
magnificent.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.982
-Oh, what do we have here?
-Hey, back off!

01:06.015 --> 01:07.351
That's my goodie bag.

01:08.352 --> 01:09.986
Ugh. An eraser.

01:10.019 --> 01:12.789
Raisins in an unsealed
sandwich bag.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.558
Oh, a parachute guy.

01:14.591 --> 01:16.993
Uhp, he's already tangled.

01:17.026 --> 01:18.828
This day started off so great.

01:18.862 --> 01:21.265
It was awash in cake
and pony boners.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.433
Now all I have
is this dumb whistle.

01:23.467 --> 01:24.501
-(exhales)
-Doesn't even work.

01:25.369 --> 01:26.603
(exhales)

01:26.636 --> 01:28.172
Ow! What the hell?!

01:28.205 --> 01:29.839
Oh, it's a dog whistle.

01:29.873 --> 01:31.808
-(exhales)
-(shouts)

01:31.841 --> 01:34.178
I've always wondered
what that sounds like to you.

01:34.211 --> 01:35.745
(inhales)

01:35.779 --> 01:38.415
GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
Dog whistle! Dog whistle!

01:38.448 --> 01:40.750
Where are you, dog?!

01:40.784 --> 01:41.951
-Give me that!
-Hey.

01:41.985 --> 01:43.453
Oh, what, you want it?
Here, take it.

01:43.487 --> 01:44.788
Give it back.

01:44.821 --> 01:47.023
-Give me it.
-No. It's mine now.

01:47.056 --> 01:49.859
In fact, I'm gonna put it
where you can never reach it.

01:49.893 --> 01:51.195
No!

01:51.228 --> 01:53.530
-Good luck, shrimp.
-(grunting)

01:55.299 --> 01:57.601
I can't believe
the nerve of that dog.

01:57.634 --> 01:59.603
Teaching me a lesson about size?

01:59.636 --> 02:02.005
I'm not even that small.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.773
Tiny Tom Cruise?

02:03.807 --> 02:06.210
Oh, hey, little guy.
Forgot my sunglasses.

02:06.243 --> 02:08.612
Hey, what's with
your gay character names lately?

02:08.645 --> 02:10.514
Stacee Jaxx? Jack Reacher?

02:10.547 --> 02:12.182
I mean,
who are you playing next?

02:12.216 --> 02:14.551
(chuckles): All right,
try to make this sound gay:

02:14.584 --> 02:17.020
next up, I play
Headmaster Bates Mann.

02:17.053 --> 02:18.722
-Anything else?
-Actually, yes.

02:18.755 --> 02:21.825
After that, I'll be taking
the role of Major Dixon Butts,

02:21.858 --> 02:23.993
then Senator Rod Clutcher.

02:24.027 --> 02:27.030
(audience applause)

02:27.063 --> 02:29.065
(electricity crackling)

02:33.437 --> 02:35.739
I'm too small, am I, Brian?

02:35.772 --> 02:38.375
Well, we'll just see
who's the bigger man.

02:38.408 --> 02:42.178
"Brian, sorry I got testy.
Let's bury the hatchet.

02:42.212 --> 02:44.481
"If you're free,
I'd love to hear about

02:44.514 --> 02:46.716
-any new writing projects
you're working..."
-(knocking on door)

02:46.750 --> 02:48.652
Oh, at least wait
for me to send it.

02:48.685 --> 02:49.986
-(text message chirps)
-(computer chimes)

02:50.019 --> 02:52.689
Hey, Stewie, I got your text.
What am I working on?

02:52.722 --> 02:54.724
(chuckles):
What am I not working on?

02:54.758 --> 02:57.227
Well, first off, I got this
screenplay for Tom Cruise,

02:57.261 --> 03:00.330
about the queen's private
secretary, Sir Gaylord Hummer.

03:00.364 --> 03:01.831
Well, actually,
he might do that.

03:01.865 --> 03:06.336
But, Brian, I'm more interested
in short stories.

03:06.370 --> 03:07.804
(whirring)

03:15.044 --> 03:18.047
(shouts, voice pitch increases)

03:23.487 --> 03:26.022
(footsteps rumbling)

03:26.055 --> 03:28.725
(echoing):
Well, hello there, little guy.

03:28.758 --> 03:30.394
(high-pitched): What the hell
did you do to me, Stewie?

03:30.427 --> 03:32.596
Well, Brian, you seemed
to enjoy belittling me,

03:32.629 --> 03:34.464
so I decided to belittle you.

03:34.498 --> 03:36.533
I've simply shrunken down
your molecular structure.

03:36.566 --> 03:38.101
It was easy, really.

03:38.134 --> 03:41.738
Like taking candy,
or a whistle, from a baby.

03:41.771 --> 03:43.573
You dick. Undo this.

03:43.607 --> 03:45.074
This is perfect.

03:45.108 --> 03:46.876
I think my excitement
is best expressed

03:46.910 --> 03:49.646
by Jean-Claude Van Damme
in this scene.

03:49.679 --> 03:51.415
(dance music playing)

04:01.791 --> 04:03.960
All right, you've made
your point. I'm sorry.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.929
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear that;
it's too high-pitched.

04:05.962 --> 04:07.464
-You're what?
-I'm sorry.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.299
-For what?
-For calling you a shrimp.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.934
-And?
-What do you mean "and"?

04:10.967 --> 04:12.969
Come on, you know what I want.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.305
And... all four chairs

04:15.339 --> 04:17.807
would totally turn for you
on The Voice.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.809
-Anything else?
-(sighs)

04:19.843 --> 04:22.346
And the way you salute
and point is very casual

04:22.379 --> 04:24.247
and free of affectation.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.850
Hey, thanks, Bri.
I'll go switch you back.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.854
(rapid footsteps)

04:35.124 --> 04:36.426
(sniffs)

04:36.460 --> 04:38.094
-(growls)
-Stewie!

04:38.127 --> 04:39.596
You know,
I'm really flattered you think

04:39.629 --> 04:41.798
all four Voice chairs
would turn around.

04:41.831 --> 04:44.133
My dream order
would be Adam, Blake,

04:44.167 --> 04:46.370
Alicia Keys,
and then Kelly Clarkson,

04:46.403 --> 04:48.605
whose chair I imagine
would turn last,

04:48.638 --> 04:52.342
'cause she's, uh...
she's a bigger gal.

04:52.376 --> 04:53.910
Help!

04:54.978 --> 04:56.846
Oh, crap.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.882
Don't worry, Brian,
I'll save you!

04:58.915 --> 05:01.184
But I'm a millennial,
so first I have to watch

05:01.217 --> 05:03.820
a YouTube instructional video
on how to do it.

05:03.853 --> 05:05.389
What's going on, guys?

05:05.422 --> 05:06.990
I'm Corey, and today
I'm gonna teach you

05:07.023 --> 05:08.992
how to get your friend
out of a rat hole.

05:09.025 --> 05:11.060
Now, before we get started,
don't forget to subscribe

05:11.094 --> 05:12.796
to my channel, Corey's World.

05:12.829 --> 05:15.298
And, guys, I'll get to
as many comments as I can,

05:15.331 --> 05:17.033
but I can't get to all of them.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.902
And don't forget to check out
my other videos,

05:18.935 --> 05:20.504
like "How to Play Guitar."

05:20.537 --> 05:22.338
Uh, Brian,
this might be a while.

05:22.372 --> 05:24.708
What's going on, guys?
I'm Corey.

05:29.946 --> 05:32.916
Brian?
Hang in there, buddy.

05:32.949 --> 05:35.318
BRIAN (high-pitched): Hurry up!
Get this rat away from me!

05:35.351 --> 05:37.353
I'll shrink myself down
and come get you.

05:37.387 --> 05:39.188
But in the meantime, they say

05:39.222 --> 05:41.858
if you put your finger in
a rat's butt, that disables it.

05:41.891 --> 05:43.593
(rat screeches)

05:43.627 --> 05:45.595
BRIAN: It didn't work.
Now he's just angry.

05:45.629 --> 05:47.564
Try wetting your finger first.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.700
-(rat screeches)
-BRIAN: Just get in here!

05:53.403 --> 05:54.604
(whirring)

05:58.775 --> 06:01.344
(rat growling)

06:01.377 --> 06:04.147
Hey, come on, guy. (chuckles)
Hey, you don't want to do this.

06:12.656 --> 06:14.958
I'll have what she's having.

06:14.991 --> 06:16.426
(squishes)

06:18.294 --> 06:19.729
Please tell me
that's not the finger

06:19.763 --> 06:21.230
you stuck in a rat's butt.

06:21.264 --> 06:23.967
No. It... I don't-I don't
remember which one it was.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.802
Yeah, that was the finger.

06:25.835 --> 06:28.938
All right, let's get back
to the machine.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.940
Look at all this shag carpet.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.942
This is like our Vietnam movie.

06:32.976 --> 06:35.044
(Southern accent):
I miss Jenny.

06:35.078 --> 06:38.147
-What is that?
-That's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

06:38.181 --> 06:40.484
-Yeah, I-I don't think so.
-Shh.

06:40.517 --> 06:42.952
-(distant mechanical humming)
-What is that?

06:42.986 --> 06:45.822
It ain't a box of chocolates.

06:45.855 --> 06:47.491
(whirring)

06:47.524 --> 06:49.526
(normal voice):
Vacuum cleaner!

06:52.629 --> 06:55.164
(both screaming)

06:55.198 --> 06:59.969
I hate my life and nobody
can hear me say it right now!

07:08.177 --> 07:10.179
(both screaming)

07:13.182 --> 07:15.819
(whirring stops)

07:15.852 --> 07:18.354
Oh, my God, this is disgusting!

07:18.387 --> 07:20.123
I just hope
she's done vacuuming.

07:20.156 --> 07:21.791
-(vacuum squeaking)
-LOIS: Okay, everyone,

07:21.825 --> 07:24.293
dump your toenails in the hall;
I'm vacuuming.

07:24.327 --> 07:26.395
-(vacuum whirring)
-Oh, God.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.038
That was close.

07:40.476 --> 07:41.978
(both screaming)

07:48.918 --> 07:51.220
Oh, my God,
we're in the trash outside!

07:51.254 --> 07:54.423
We've got to get down from here.
Quick, pass me that baggie.

08:00.029 --> 08:02.365
How am I supposed to get down?
That was the only baggie.

08:02.398 --> 08:03.900
Use either the tampon strings

08:03.933 --> 08:06.770
or the discarded dental floss
and rappel down.

08:09.038 --> 08:10.874
-(bones crack)
-Which one did you go with?

08:10.907 --> 08:13.509
Neither.
I was hoping to kill myself.

08:13.543 --> 08:16.212
(whistling)

08:16.245 --> 08:19.148
Two days of mail at once,
nobody knows.

08:19.182 --> 08:21.551
Don't go over two.
Don't get greedy.

08:21.585 --> 08:22.886
(snorts)

08:22.919 --> 08:25.088
Uhp, got a bat in the cave.

08:25.121 --> 08:27.090
All right, I figure
if we can just--

08:27.123 --> 08:28.925
What's going on? An eclipse?

08:28.958 --> 08:31.427
-Ah! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Holy crap! What is that?!

08:31.460 --> 08:33.396
-Gross! Oh!
-What is on us? Oh!

08:35.732 --> 08:37.533
Ah! Snot rocket!

08:37.567 --> 08:39.769
Oh, my God, it's so disgusting!

08:39.803 --> 08:41.771
Get it off!
Get it off!

08:41.805 --> 08:44.440
-Are you guys eating that?
-Uh, what?

08:44.473 --> 08:47.443
Are you eating
this pile of boogers?

08:47.476 --> 08:50.413
-Uh, no.
-Can I eat it?

08:50.446 --> 08:52.949
Yeah, please. We're stuck.

08:52.982 --> 08:56.285
Dude, dude, you got to get down
here, by the big trash can.

08:56.319 --> 08:58.287
Dude, dude, dude, just get here.

08:58.321 --> 09:01.424
(bee buzzing)

09:01.457 --> 09:02.892
Brian, we've got
to get up to my room.

09:02.926 --> 09:04.460
Yeah, but how?

09:04.493 --> 09:06.963
We'll just climb the lattice
on the front of the house.

09:08.564 --> 09:11.267
-When did we get that?
-Well, every '80s movie had one,

09:11.300 --> 09:13.803
so the fat man thought
we should have one, too.

09:13.837 --> 09:17.206
Wow. Okay, great.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.142
You know, it's funny,
you said "every '80s movie,"

09:19.175 --> 09:20.977
but I can't think
of a single one.

09:21.010 --> 09:23.112
-Ferris Bueller's Day Off?
-I don't think so.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.481
But the lattice thing
sounded right when you said it.

09:25.514 --> 09:28.084
I-I feel like '80s movies
were wall-to-wall lattices.

09:28.117 --> 09:30.987
-Sixteen Candles?
-Hmm... no, no.

09:31.020 --> 09:33.089
I mean, she was being ignored
most of the movie.

09:33.122 --> 09:34.758
Who'd be climbing
into her window?

09:34.791 --> 09:36.559
Ah, good point.
Risky Business?

09:36.592 --> 09:37.994
No. Hookers don't climb.

09:38.027 --> 09:39.328
Oh, I know, Home Alone.

09:39.362 --> 09:40.997
Home Alone must've
had a lattice.

09:41.030 --> 09:43.132
Maybe, but that was 1990.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.068
Eh, it feels like an '80s movie.

09:45.101 --> 09:47.103
You know, it was probably
greenlit in the '80s,

09:47.136 --> 09:48.772
when lattices were
still a thing.

09:48.805 --> 09:50.306
Oh, wow, here we are.

09:55.779 --> 09:58.648
All right, Brian, at this size,
this is a two-man job.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.784
While I adjust the settings,
you go over there

10:00.817 --> 10:03.552
and hit the tiny button
to fire it up.

10:07.724 --> 10:08.892
(whirring)

10:17.734 --> 10:19.202
Wait a minute.

10:19.235 --> 10:21.537
This doesn't feel right.
What button did you hit?

10:21.570 --> 10:23.572
That one. The tiny button.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.475
STEWIE: Wait, did you hit
the tiny button

10:26.509 --> 10:28.144
or the button that says "tiny"?

10:28.177 --> 10:29.545
I hit the button
that says "tiny."

10:29.578 --> 10:31.314
-You said,
"Hit the tiny button."
-Exactly!

10:31.347 --> 10:33.883
I didn't say, "Hit the big
button that says 'tiny,'"

10:33.917 --> 10:35.151
I said, "hit the tiny button."

10:35.184 --> 10:36.986
The one you pressed
is going to shrink us down

10:37.020 --> 10:38.354
to microscopic size!

10:38.387 --> 10:40.289
Well, why would you make
the tiny button big?

10:40.323 --> 10:43.092
I had to make it big enough
to write "tiny" on it!

10:45.929 --> 10:48.231
BRIAN: Well, what the hell
do we do now?!

10:48.264 --> 10:49.565
STEWIE:
I don't...

10:49.598 --> 10:51.367
I-I'm still thinking
about that lattice thing.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.002
I want to say Parenthood?

10:53.036 --> 10:56.239
BRIAN: Parenthood. Yes.
I feel like Parenthood is right.

11:09.953 --> 11:11.955
(creatures chirping)

11:17.526 --> 11:19.095
It's beautiful.

11:19.128 --> 11:21.765
Ah, I just wish my hot
girlfriend were here to see it.

11:21.798 --> 11:23.432
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, you have a girlfriend?

11:23.466 --> 11:27.536
-What's her name?
-Girly... Friendston.

11:27.570 --> 11:30.273
"Girly Friendston"?
Nice try, Stewie.

11:30.306 --> 11:32.275
Why won't he answer my texts?

11:32.308 --> 11:34.277
WOMAN: Girly, your piano
teacher's here.

11:34.310 --> 11:36.946
-Oh, Mom, do I have to?
-Girly Friendston,

11:36.980 --> 11:39.215
you stop mooning over
that boyfriend of yours

11:39.248 --> 11:42.151
-and get down here this instant.
-(sighs)

11:47.556 --> 11:50.459
(knock on door)

11:50.493 --> 11:52.295
Hi. I'm the exterminator.

11:52.328 --> 11:55.431
An ex-Terminator?
So you used to be a Terminator?

11:55.464 --> 11:58.401
-No. I kill rats and bugs.
-And Sarah Connor.

11:58.434 --> 12:01.537
-No, Peter. We have a rat.
-My stuff's in my truck.

12:01.570 --> 12:03.639
-I'll be back.
-(gasps)

12:03.672 --> 12:05.108
See that, Lois?

12:05.141 --> 12:06.976
There's more Terminators around
than you think there are.

12:07.010 --> 12:09.012
(beeping)

12:16.019 --> 12:17.987
I hope he can terminate

12:18.021 --> 12:21.057
some of the bad attitudes
on our kids, huh?

12:21.090 --> 12:23.192
(laughs weakly)
Yeah.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.167

-What's that sound?

12:31.200 --> 12:32.836
Oh, my God! Look!

12:47.550 --> 12:49.752
Holy crap, what the hell
were those things?!

12:49.785 --> 12:51.087
Dust mites.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.689
One of the most dominant species
of the micro world.

12:53.722 --> 12:55.191
Why did they just
attack like that?

12:56.559 --> 12:59.362

What's a water bear?

13:05.668 --> 13:07.636
They're predominantly
water-dwelling, eight-legged

13:07.670 --> 13:09.438
segmented micro animals.

13:09.472 --> 13:12.508
They're also known as
a moss piglet or a tardigrade.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.211
You can call me tardy,
but I'm always on time.

13:55.584 --> 13:57.053
Okay, Brian, take the ride.

What the...? Hey, cut it out!

14:04.693 --> 14:06.896
You have water?
Water is life.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.697
Yeah, we need water bad.

14:08.731 --> 14:12.335
And I'm the gay one, but I'm
not, like, doing the gay voice.

14:12.368 --> 14:14.403
Listen, Stewie and I
come from a place

14:14.437 --> 14:17.040
where water flows like...
well, water.

14:17.073 --> 14:18.908
That's right.
And we need to get back there.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.576
And if you guys help us,

14:20.609 --> 14:23.579
we'll make sure you never
want for water again.

Patrick Stewart!

14:32.321 --> 14:34.790
-Well, what'd you find?
-I'll be honest.

14:34.823 --> 14:38.027
I think this is a conversation
best had over dinner.

14:38.061 --> 14:40.964
Oh. Okay.

14:40.997 --> 14:42.531
So what's going on
with the house?

14:42.565 --> 14:44.600
I don't like talking business
at the table.

14:44.633 --> 14:48.104
-Let's just enjoy our wine.
-You're right. I'm sorry.

14:49.738 --> 14:51.274
(quietly):
Your wife's asleep.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.109
Sometimes she fakes it
so I can't hump her,

14:53.142 --> 14:54.978
but this seems legit.

14:55.011 --> 14:58.081
So, uh, shouldn't we talk about
what you found at our house?

14:58.114 --> 15:01.584
I don't know. It's so late.
I have a crazy idea.

15:01.617 --> 15:03.619
Should we talk about it
over a nightcap?

15:03.652 --> 15:05.588
Uh, sure, I guess.

15:07.590 --> 15:09.625
I'm a little chilly.

15:09.658 --> 15:12.528
Oh, well, I-I guess
I don't need this.

15:14.964 --> 15:18.667
Sir? Sir, I asked you what
you found out about the house.

15:18.701 --> 15:21.637
What? Oh. You're gonna
have to tent the house.

15:21.670 --> 15:24.340
All right. Thanks for your work.
You're very professional.

15:24.373 --> 15:26.675
Yeah, that's me. Professional.

15:26.709 --> 15:28.544
Always professional.
