00:07.974 --> 00:09.811
Previously on Marvel's Runaways...

00:09.895 --> 00:11.899
KAROLINA: This place is
paid for by our parents?

00:11.982 --> 00:13.276
We can't eat that soup.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.030
ALEX:
Nico's right. That's Pride soup.

No, no, no! Hey, don't!

00:20.708 --> 00:21.877
[Old Lace snarls]

00:21.961 --> 00:24.006
You guys are into
some seriously weird shit.

00:24.090 --> 00:24.967
How about a free ticket?

00:26.094 --> 00:27.388
I'll even save you a dance.

00:27.471 --> 00:29.977
We'll take five tickets,
you hateful bitch.

00:30.060 --> 00:31.814
Looks like Brandon stole your life.

00:31.897 --> 00:32.816
He can have it.

00:32.899 --> 00:35.487
Keep it off the radar of the cops,
the media,

00:35.572 --> 00:37.241
and, most importantly, Jonah.

00:37.324 --> 00:39.161
I want to hurt him as much
as the rest of you do.

00:39.245 --> 00:40.832
Not possible.

00:40.915 --> 00:43.963
This serum...
that Jonah used on Victor.

00:44.046 --> 00:46.175
-DALE: Mm-hm?
-STACEY: It's based on his DNA.

00:46.259 --> 00:49.140
Jonah may have just given us
the very thing that we need...

00:49.223 --> 00:50.267
to kill him.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.856
If I'm gonna heal myself,
I need another box.

00:52.939 --> 00:54.735
CATHERINE: You're gonna do
one more thing for him.

00:54.818 --> 00:58.033
-Yeah? What's that?
-Same as you did for his father--

00:58.116 --> 00:59.786
take the rap for his murder charge.

01:08.053 --> 01:10.307
GERT: Tell me the truth now--
where were you?!

01:10.390 --> 01:12.394
YOUNG MAN: Aw, man!
She wrecked a pimp's car.

01:12.478 --> 01:13.648
It was freakin' awesome!

01:14.398 --> 01:17.321
Damn. This sure beats
staying in a hostel, huh?

01:17.404 --> 01:18.824
I'm Topher.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.128
-Not another step.
-[Topher chuckles]

01:25.212 --> 01:28.636
I got you people tilted, huh?
Don't worry, amigos.

01:28.719 --> 01:31.725
-I'm not gonna hurt you
-¿Quién eres tú? Do I know you?

01:31.809 --> 01:34.480
No, muñeca. Not yet.
¿Cómo te llamas?

01:34.564 --> 01:37.069
Did you follow her home?
'Cause I'll kick your ass right now.

01:37.152 --> 01:40.200
-Not quite fast enough, lindo.
-Let's ask some questions first.

01:40.283 --> 01:41.411
Ah, the leader, eh?

01:41.494 --> 01:43.582
I'd shake your hand,
but doesn't look like we're there yet.

01:43.666 --> 01:45.795
-Who are you?
-He's an undercover cop.

01:45.878 --> 01:47.715
He's gonna bust us and send us back
to our parents who'll murder us,

01:47.799 --> 01:50.262
or he's just a cold-blooded killer
and he's gonna murder us right here,

01:50.345 --> 01:52.266
or he's a blackmailer
and he's gonna demand money,

01:52.349 --> 01:54.353
which we don't have--
we will end up murdered.

01:54.437 --> 01:55.815
TOPHER:
Everyone take a deep breath, OK?

01:56.441 --> 02:00.365
If you saw a little girl pick up a car,
you'd check it out, too.

02:00.449 --> 02:02.829
Muñeca is a hero, for real.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.837
This guy on the street was
messing with this lady,

02:06.920 --> 02:10.050
and I tried to talk him out of it...
with my fists.

02:10.134 --> 02:11.555
I had to protect her.

02:11.638 --> 02:12.974
You didn't think
to mention this to anyone?

02:13.057 --> 02:14.310
I'm mentioning it now.

02:14.393 --> 02:16.690
When I heard them talk
about the girl with the yellow eyes,

02:16.774 --> 02:17.901
I had to check it out.

02:17.984 --> 02:21.867
Did I think it would lead me to a...
mansión arruinada?

02:21.950 --> 02:24.581
He means "ruined mansion."
It's so poetic.

02:24.664 --> 02:27.461
But now that I'm here, you gotta
give me the name of your decorator,

02:27.545 --> 02:29.048
'cause this place is dope as shit!

02:29.131 --> 02:30.050
Cone of Silence!

02:30.133 --> 02:32.095
[whooshing]

02:35.227 --> 02:36.270
He can't hear us now.

02:36.354 --> 02:38.149
What do we do with him? Discuss.

02:38.233 --> 02:39.653
-Let's get rid of him.
-I'm with Chase.

02:39.736 --> 02:42.324
Isn't he just like us?
So what? We find safety,

02:42.407 --> 02:44.078
then we just
abandon everybody else?

02:44.161 --> 02:46.708
-We are Brentwood people.
-That's wrong. Let him stay.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.211
The cops aren't even looking
for us anymore.

02:48.294 --> 02:49.548
Who knows if we can
trust this kid?

02:52.302 --> 02:54.473
CHASE: Yeah. I mean,
look at him. He's all--

02:54.558 --> 02:56.937
KAROLINA: Homeless?
Dirty? Hungry?

02:57.020 --> 02:59.275
Uh, hello? Gert,
stand up for this guy.

02:59.358 --> 03:03.283
In the 100-yard dash
between my anxiety and my idealism,

03:03.366 --> 03:06.497
I'm ashamed to say my anxiety is winning.
I'm a hypocrite. It's official.

03:06.582 --> 03:09.044
Don't apologize. Why should we risk
letting a stranger in here?

03:09.128 --> 03:11.173
[muffled voices]

03:12.301 --> 03:15.641
You know, my parents invented something
for this exact situation.

03:15.725 --> 03:17.937
Do you remember the cartridge
we found at Graciela's house?

03:18.021 --> 03:20.400
Inside is a serum
that will wipe your whole hard rive.

03:22.446 --> 03:25.995
That 17-page term paper
you call your memory? Poof.

03:26.078 --> 03:28.249
-Great. Let's do that, then.
-No. Let's not.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.755
It's from our parents, remember?
They're bad people.

03:30.838 --> 03:34.219
If we use it, especially on a kid,
doesn't that make us just like them?

03:40.065 --> 03:41.359
You guys.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.289
CHASE:
What the...?

No. You guys,
he's not going anywhere.

03:58.560 --> 04:01.566
[low sniffs and snarls]

04:06.075 --> 04:08.496
So... what is it?

04:08.580 --> 04:10.626
-It's a "she."
-NICO: She's a rescue.

04:10.710 --> 04:13.590
-So her breed is unclear.
-Pit mix, maybe?

04:13.674 --> 04:15.636
[Old Lace growls]

04:18.726 --> 04:22.525
So a girl with glowing eyes,
a witch with a magic stick,

04:22.608 --> 04:26.950
and now a stray pup
who had Godzilla for a dad.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.494
Feels like I'm in the right place.

04:28.579 --> 04:29.622
Yes.

04:29.706 --> 04:31.835
See, maybe I had
to become a vigilante

04:31.918 --> 04:33.756
in order to find someone just like me.

04:33.839 --> 04:36.595
To bring in the seventh member of,
you know, whatever we are.

04:36.678 --> 04:38.181
-OK, Molly. Slow down.
-He's a stranger.

04:38.264 --> 04:40.686
He's got powers just like me.

04:40.770 --> 04:42.314
That can't just be a coincidence.

04:42.397 --> 04:44.694
Hey, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

04:44.778 --> 04:47.491
It's late, and everyone has
a lot of questions.

04:47.575 --> 04:50.915
-You sleep there.
-She sleeps here.

-ALEX: Yeah, I'm going to bed.

my friend and cost me

someone I really cared about,
so this guy?

Not that important to me.

I got no secrets.

I think you do.

05:13.669 --> 05:15.046
I saw what you did.

05:15.130 --> 05:16.800
What I did?

05:18.887 --> 05:20.306
And what'd I do?

05:21.392 --> 05:24.524
I don't know exactly, but you better
believe I'm gonna find out.

Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
I woke you up.

06:53.409 --> 06:55.789
Did I wake you up?
Was it the nail biting? I'm sorry.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.754
-My worrying woke you up?
-It does get a little loud sometimes.

06:58.837 --> 07:00.381
I'm sorry. It's the anxiety.

07:00.465 --> 07:02.803
It's turning me into a person
who says "I'm sorry" all the time.

07:02.887 --> 07:06.143
Hey. It's okay. It's not like
time even matters anymore.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.189
I mean, do you have somewhere
you gotta be today?

07:08.272 --> 07:09.274
I don't know.

07:09.357 --> 07:13.157
Let me check my imaginary smartphone
for my imaginary calendar.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.788
Nope. Just being a runaway again.

07:15.871 --> 07:18.084
Which means you got all day.

07:18.167 --> 07:21.633
So... you wanna talk about it?

07:25.557 --> 07:27.520
Do you ever think
about our old lives?

07:27.603 --> 07:30.651
Like where we'd be right now
if we weren't here?

07:30.734 --> 07:33.532
I try not to think about my current life,
never mind my old one.

'Cause I've never thought
that I'd want to go

07:35.661 --> 07:37.413
to an SAT prep class

or AP History.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.921

it's all just Tuesday now.

No, wait. Wednesday.
No, wait, it is Tuesday.

07:50.314 --> 07:52.110
Think it's actually Thursday.

-[both chuckle softly]
-Whatever.

07:53.947 --> 07:54.949
This...

07:56.828 --> 07:57.872
is the new normal.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.094
The new normal's not all bad.

08:05.178 --> 08:06.180
Yeah.

08:06.263 --> 08:07.892
It's got an upside, for sure.

08:09.729 --> 08:13.152
But it does mean I have
a pet dinosaur to go check on, so...

Say hey to Molly's new bestie.

08:16.659 --> 08:19.874

on our mysterious stranger,

08:40.916 --> 08:43.880
You know when I say "my,"
I don't mean like I own you, right?

'Cause of course not. You're like--
you're like a fully sovereign being.

Topher?

09:15.276 --> 09:18.032
Guys?

09:18.115 --> 09:20.704
Guess we're the first ones here.
You want some coffee?

[systems hum]

09:22.875 --> 09:24.377
Coffee?

09:24.461 --> 09:27.091
Cat, did you honestly think you could
just act like this didn't happen

09:27.175 --> 09:28.344
and I'd go along with it?

09:28.427 --> 09:30.682
Well, since there's nothing
you can do about it, yeah.

09:30.766 --> 09:32.603
What's the point
of making it a thing?

09:32.686 --> 09:35.107
Because this is a thing.

09:35.191 --> 09:38.280
You killin' a man I consider my brother,
that's a goddamn thing.

09:38.364 --> 09:41.621
It was necessary, Geoffrey.

09:41.704 --> 09:44.417
I did it so you didn't have to.

09:46.046 --> 09:47.298
And he wasn't your brother.

09:51.056 --> 09:53.520
Darius had Alex.

09:54.689 --> 09:57.276
He could have shot him,
thrown his body off a bridge,

09:57.360 --> 09:58.362
but he didn't.

09:58.445 --> 10:02.705
He kept our son safe
and brought him back to us.

10:02.788 --> 10:06.378
Why? Because he was
loyal to me. Always.

10:06.461 --> 10:08.967
He did it because he wanted money.

10:10.512 --> 10:14.729
What you remember about life
back in the day is a fantasy.

10:14.812 --> 10:17.191
Bein' OG, runnin' a crew...

10:17.275 --> 10:19.404
There was a code!

10:19.487 --> 10:21.576
A sense of loyalty, a brotherhood.

10:21.659 --> 10:23.747
There was a bunch of
broke-ass punks slingin' dope,

10:23.830 --> 10:25.625
tryin' to knock each other off.

10:26.627 --> 10:29.633
[Catherine sighs]

10:29.717 --> 10:32.346
Did I not meet you
because you killed your boss?

10:33.516 --> 10:35.144
Was he your brother, too?

10:36.271 --> 10:39.194
-That was different.
-It was business.

10:39.277 --> 10:41.239
And so was this.

10:42.450 --> 10:44.705
We had a plan to free our kids.

10:44.789 --> 10:47.043
This was not our plan!

10:52.805 --> 10:54.767
TINA:
Congratulations.

10:54.850 --> 10:57.438
Our kids are no longer

Finally, our first solid lead.

12:09.374 --> 12:12.088
I tracked the kids using data
from Alex's cell phone.

12:12.171 --> 12:13.298
Which you got from Alex

12:13.382 --> 12:15.887
during your failed mission
to extract him, your rogue mission.

12:15.971 --> 12:17.933
Turn down the volume
on the attitude, Leslie.

12:18.016 --> 12:19.687
The information
about Alex came to us.

12:19.770 --> 12:21.565
Yeah, and you kept it
for yourselves.

12:21.649 --> 12:23.193
Your word means nothing, Wilders.

12:23.276 --> 12:26.408
OK, let's go easy
on the big fella, sweetie.

12:26.491 --> 12:28.161
But, um, Stacey does have a point.

12:28.245 --> 12:29.748
We all agreed, no more secrets.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.838
-We all just want our kids back.
-And you had them right there.

12:32.921 --> 12:34.132
How could you just let them go?

12:34.215 --> 12:35.467
You mean how could I stop them?

12:36.469 --> 12:38.599
Why don't you ask Tina that?

12:39.727 --> 12:43.150
The kids got away
because Nico had the Staff.

12:43.735 --> 12:47.033
-Jog your memory?
-Yes. I gave Nico the Staff.

12:47.617 --> 12:49.328
I've already lost one child.

12:49.412 --> 12:51.291
I'm sure as hell
not gonna lose another.

12:51.374 --> 12:54.840
If that meant giving Nico a way
to survive on the street...

12:54.923 --> 12:56.342
deal with it.

12:56.426 --> 12:59.600
You should be thanking us.
That Staff is protecting your kids, too.

12:59.683 --> 13:02.313
TINA: Look, the pressure's
off our kids for the moment.

13:02.396 --> 13:05.360
We should be focusing
on the bigger problem: Jonah.

13:05.444 --> 13:07.532
DALE:
Well, as some of you may recall,

13:07.616 --> 13:11.331
Stacey and I have a serum
that we think will kill Jonah,

13:11.414 --> 13:13.418
but we need to move fast
before he figures it out.

13:13.503 --> 13:16.341
But we need to do a trial run
with the serum first.

13:16.424 --> 13:19.305
You only get one shot at a self-healing
alien, and it better be good.

13:19.388 --> 13:22.103
Yeah. We need to send a drone
down into that hole,

13:22.186 --> 13:24.232
so that we can biopsy
whatever's down there.

13:24.315 --> 13:26.529
-Biopsy whatever's--
-But we need to access the dig site.

13:26.612 --> 13:28.866
-Yeah, I can make that happen.
-DALE: Good.

13:28.950 --> 13:30.160
If the serum works,

13:30.244 --> 13:32.874
then soon none of us will need
to see each other ever again.

13:33.375 --> 13:34.377
Adiós.

13:36.799 --> 13:39.303
Guess that leaves us
to search for our kids.

13:40.557 --> 13:42.519
Looks like they're centered here.

13:42.602 --> 13:44.565
East of La Brea, west of the 5.

13:44.648 --> 13:45.482
East of La Brea?

13:46.777 --> 13:47.946
What's even over there?

13:49.700 --> 13:51.160
Why do I recognize that place?

13:51.244 --> 13:52.873
Because it's a Pride soup kitchen.

13:52.956 --> 13:56.547
That's no help.
They operate anonymously.

13:56.630 --> 13:58.216
Everything they do there
is confidential.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.930
Not if we're the ones
asking the questions.

14:02.016 --> 14:06.316
MOLLY: [chuckling]
Where did you get all this?

14:06.399 --> 14:08.111
Hold on. Don't answer that.

14:08.194 --> 14:10.365
Maybe I don't wanna know
where any of this food came from.

14:10.449 --> 14:12.913
¡Muñeca!
This is urban foraging, girl.

14:12.996 --> 14:15.208
You think only rich people
know about farm-to-table?

14:15.292 --> 14:17.212
Here. You gotta try this.

14:18.507 --> 14:19.635
Just...

14:22.473 --> 14:24.226
-This is so good.
-Ahh.

14:24.310 --> 14:25.897
I got every orange, aguacate,

14:25.980 --> 14:28.151
lemon, and pomegranate tree
around here on lockdown.

14:28.234 --> 14:30.573
And I know when the good bakeries
throw out the day-old stuff.

14:30.657 --> 14:33.078
We be feastin', sis.
You gotta come through.

14:33.161 --> 14:35.082
Oh, my God,
is that a banana nut muffin?

14:35.165 --> 14:38.338
Ah-ah-ah. We wait for the whole fam.
Sharing is caring.

14:40.384 --> 14:42.221
-Can I ask you something?
-Of course.

14:42.304 --> 14:45.895
You're the first person I've met,
ever, who's had my eyes.

14:45.979 --> 14:47.439
Ever.

14:47.524 --> 14:48.526
[sighs] Same.

14:48.609 --> 14:50.237
That's why I had to find you.

14:51.865 --> 14:53.786
All this time,
I thought it was only me.

14:54.788 --> 14:56.750
I felt so... alone.

14:56.834 --> 14:58.128
I hear that.

14:58.713 --> 15:00.465
How old were you
the first time it happened?

15:03.096 --> 15:05.142
I was right about your age,
I guess. Yeah.

15:05.225 --> 15:07.062
-I didn't know what was going on.
-Me neither.

15:07.146 --> 15:08.983
-It just kinda came out of nowhere.
-TOPHER: Right?

15:09.735 --> 15:13.283
I was always the outsider,
so for me to be that...

15:13.366 --> 15:15.412
-Fuerte.
-Yes.

15:15.495 --> 15:17.959
-I was stoked.
-MOLLY: I felt the same.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.338
Do you think maybe we're related?

15:20.422 --> 15:23.428
I mean, we both speak Spanish,
we have the same eyes...

15:24.639 --> 15:26.017
Let's see.

15:31.069 --> 15:33.741
Es verdad. Nos parecemos.

15:36.287 --> 15:38.374
I've never told anyone this, but, um...

15:39.335 --> 15:41.130
my parents were scientists,

15:41.214 --> 15:43.677
and sometimes I think
they did an experiment on me,

15:43.761 --> 15:45.305
and that's how
I ended up like this.

15:45.388 --> 15:46.432
Like a chemistry experiment?

15:46.517 --> 15:48.478
-GERT: Hey, Molly?
-MOLLY: No, they were geologists.

15:48.562 --> 15:51.985
They worked with rocks.
Does that make any sense to you?

15:52.069 --> 15:53.446
[footsteps]

15:53.531 --> 15:55.868
Hey. Me and Molly
whipped up some chow.

15:55.952 --> 15:57.329
GERT:
So this is why you left?

15:57.412 --> 16:00.293
Explains the little
remodeling job upstairs.

16:00.377 --> 16:01.880
We assumed
you were gone for good.

16:01.964 --> 16:04.385
And by "assumed,"
I mean "hoped."

16:04.468 --> 16:06.849
You showed me kindness,
amigo, and I'm showing it back.

16:07.517 --> 16:10.606
[sighs] Had to get past
your "guard dog" first.

16:11.525 --> 16:14.823
-What's this?
-My guard dog.

16:14.906 --> 16:16.242
[Topher laughs]

16:16.325 --> 16:18.371
You people are muy interesante.

16:19.708 --> 16:22.087
Is there something going on here
that I need to know about?

16:23.298 --> 16:25.093
I think you know too much already.

16:28.308 --> 16:33.484
Sorry... but he might be my relative.
Isn't that nuts?

16:33.569 --> 16:35.155
Where did your relative
get all this food?

16:35.238 --> 16:38.453
-It's called urban foraging.
-Is that like artisanal stealing?

16:38.537 --> 16:39.915
TOPHER:
No, man. Stolen goods?

16:39.998 --> 16:42.085
That ain't me.
I asked permission first.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.379
Go ahead, make yourself a plate.

16:46.052 --> 16:47.429
No?

16:48.264 --> 16:51.312
Look, I can see you guys
aren't... sure about me.

16:51.395 --> 16:53.024
You're right. We aren't.

16:53.107 --> 16:54.527
So I'm gonna be honest.

16:55.863 --> 16:57.491
I know who you are.

16:57.575 --> 16:58.827
You been all over the news.

16:59.579 --> 17:01.583
Pretty hard to miss, you ask me.

17:02.209 --> 17:03.294
You should leave.

17:03.378 --> 17:06.425
Oye. Cálmate, hombre.
Think about it.

17:06.510 --> 17:09.598
You know why you can trust me?
Because I don't need you.

17:09.683 --> 17:12.605
I've already got this whole
street-life thing wired.

17:12.689 --> 17:13.691
You guys?

17:14.776 --> 17:16.194
You need
all the help you can get.

17:16.279 --> 17:18.407
We're doing fine, thanks.

17:18.491 --> 17:20.453
[scoffs] Are you?

17:20.538 --> 17:22.374
You can't even
say yes to good food.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.171
That kind of pride
is just some rookie shit.

17:25.255 --> 17:27.885
Us street kids,
we stick together.

17:28.637 --> 17:30.015
We give and we take...

17:31.560 --> 17:32.854
and that's how we survive.

17:32.937 --> 17:35.483
I have skills,
knowledge you can use--

17:35.568 --> 17:37.530
Oh, yeah?
Like where to dumpster dive?

17:37.614 --> 17:41.329
Damn straight.
This ain't Brentwood, you fool.

17:41.412 --> 17:42.289
OK, so what's in it for you?

17:44.794 --> 17:46.548
TOPHER:
¡Claro!

17:46.632 --> 17:49.261
I like sleeping indoors...
in a bed.

17:49.345 --> 17:51.182
Thanks for the offer.
We'll think about it.

17:51.265 --> 17:52.518
TOPHER: Look, I'm just saying.

17:52.602 --> 17:55.775
Rich kid runaways...
you gotta be extra careful.

17:55.858 --> 17:58.822
You're like housecats out in the wild.

17:59.323 --> 18:03.122
I remember this one dude--
good-looking, deluxe family...

18:03.206 --> 18:06.379
but when folks on the street found out
that there was a reward on him,

18:06.462 --> 18:08.091
they didn't hesitate to collect.

18:09.511 --> 18:10.513
He just...

18:11.807 --> 18:14.562
hadn't built that loyalty
out here, you know?

18:21.492 --> 18:23.747
[sighs, laughs]

18:23.831 --> 18:25.375
Not that I would do that,
you know?

18:25.458 --> 18:28.841
It's just, not everyone
is as trustworthy as me.

18:31.011 --> 18:33.767
Enough of all that, please.
Who wants quiche?

18:40.113 --> 18:42.159
I think this one's gluten-free.

18:43.286 --> 18:45.666
I saw him eat one of these.
It's not poison.

18:47.252 --> 18:49.339
Yes. I knew they'd come around.
Come on.

18:49.423 --> 18:50.593
Let me give you a tour
of your new home.

18:51.177 --> 18:52.638
TOPHER:
Lead the way, muñeca.

18:52.722 --> 18:54.224
Don't get lost.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.228
Or do.

19:00.780 --> 19:02.825
[plate clatters]

19:02.909 --> 19:04.369
CHASE:
You're not hungry either?

19:04.453 --> 19:07.125
There's something about that guy
that makes me lose my appetite.

19:07.209 --> 19:09.296
Maybe you're just jealous...
or threatened.

19:09.379 --> 19:10.633
What? Why would I be jealous?

19:10.716 --> 19:11.885
Because he's handsome,

19:11.968 --> 19:14.056
and street-smart,
and a really good provider.

19:14.139 --> 19:15.684
Chase is handsome.

19:15.768 --> 19:16.770
This is so good.

19:16.853 --> 19:18.857
We should all feel threatened.
He's hiding something.

19:18.941 --> 19:21.195
Whatever he's done, it's nothing
compared to our parents.

19:23.282 --> 19:25.286
GERT: Guess someone
couldn't sleep last night.

19:30.046 --> 19:31.131
You OK?

19:31.215 --> 19:33.846
As long as Pride pays
for what they've done, I am.

19:35.056 --> 19:37.477
-You put your hair back.
-I lost my focus.

19:37.562 --> 19:40.483
But I'm back now, and we still
have an earthquake to stop.

19:40.568 --> 19:42.905
Yeah, except now
we got a new distraction.

19:42.989 --> 19:45.243
Molly thinks
he's her long-lost brother.

19:49.293 --> 19:51.171
TINA:
Jules, are you sure that you didn't

19:51.255 --> 19:53.092
see these kids at the soup kitchen?

19:53.175 --> 19:55.138
She's blonde, tall,
really pretty?

19:55.221 --> 19:58.687
-JANET: Athletic. Played lacrosse.
-Top knot, dark lipstick. Angry.

19:58.770 --> 20:00.816
I really wish I could tell you more.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.528
A lot of kids fit those descriptions.

20:02.612 --> 20:04.489
But all of these kids
would be together.

20:04.574 --> 20:06.118
All six of 'em, in a group.

20:06.201 --> 20:09.542
I really do serve hundreds
of people every day, so...

20:11.253 --> 20:12.757
You're lying. You've seen 'em.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.596
If this is your way
of keeping them anonymous...

20:15.679 --> 20:17.808
Let us reassure you,
it's safe to tell us.

20:17.892 --> 20:19.311
Especially if you like your job.

20:21.315 --> 20:22.568
Yeah, I said it.

20:22.652 --> 20:24.864
She's a volunteer, Catherine.

20:24.948 --> 20:27.327
JULES:
I really am sorry I can't help.

20:27.410 --> 20:28.412
Tell you what, though,

20:28.496 --> 20:31.418
there is a client at the soup kitchen
who's very plugged in.

20:31.503 --> 20:33.548
He knows everything
that happens on the streets.

20:33.632 --> 20:35.552
I brought him with me just in case.

20:37.055 --> 20:38.850
Would you like to meet with him?

20:38.934 --> 20:39.978
ALL: Yes!

20:41.940 --> 20:43.192
Yeah, I've definitely seen 'em.

20:43.275 --> 20:44.612
-Where?
-Did they seem healthy?

20:44.696 --> 20:47.242
I'd be happy to tell you more,

20:47.325 --> 20:49.914
but you know, I was
a finance major once upon a time,

20:49.998 --> 20:52.127
before I realized
the only true freedom in this country

20:52.210 --> 20:54.214
is off the grid
in the underground economy.

20:54.297 --> 20:58.557
And according to my rather
conservative asset-pricing model,

20:58.640 --> 21:01.604
I'm gonna need fifty bucks first.

21:01.688 --> 21:03.608
You tryin' to shake a bitch down
over their kids?

21:03.692 --> 21:05.946
ROBERT:
Here ya go. Fifty dollars.

21:06.030 --> 21:07.616
Start talkin'.

21:07.700 --> 21:11.666
So, I first saw 'em down
at the homeless encampment

21:11.750 --> 21:13.503
near the L. A. River.

21:13.587 --> 21:14.964
I mean, could you miss them?

21:15.048 --> 21:17.177
I'm surprised they survived
the night down there.

21:17.260 --> 21:20.099
But they are apparently
way more craftier than they look,

21:20.183 --> 21:22.938
because the next thing I know,
they stole my electric baseball gloves.

21:23.022 --> 21:25.903
Electric baseball gloves?

21:25.986 --> 21:27.155
The Fistigons.

21:27.238 --> 21:28.365
Is that what you call 'em?

21:28.449 --> 21:30.954
Because those mothers
are pretty bad-ass.

21:31.038 --> 21:33.167
I was havin' some fun,
I was blowing shit up,

21:33.250 --> 21:35.296
and then all of a sudden
your kids are chasin' after me.

21:35.379 --> 21:36.716
And then--

21:36.800 --> 21:37.968
What happened?

21:39.054 --> 21:41.851
I want to say they had a dinosaur.

21:43.688 --> 21:46.276
But I'm gonna chalk that up
to a bonkers night of drinkin'.

21:46.360 --> 21:49.282
All's I know is,
the pretty boy grabbed the gloves,

21:49.366 --> 21:51.579
and I haven't seen those kids since.

21:52.288 --> 21:53.625
But I will assure you,

21:53.708 --> 21:56.881
they ran real fast
and looked very healthy.

21:56.965 --> 21:58.092
That's all I got.

22:03.435 --> 22:07.193
Don't suppose you people care
to reimburse me for the baseball gloves?

22:09.239 --> 22:11.661
Mike...

22:11.744 --> 22:15.502
you might want to keep working on
that asset-pricing model of yours,

22:15.586 --> 22:18.758
because I would have given you
a hundred if you'd asked.

22:19.802 --> 22:20.929
Hm.

22:28.945 --> 22:30.114
[phone line ringing]

22:30.198 --> 22:32.870
FEMALE VOICE:
Your call has been forwarded

22:32.953 --> 22:34.749
to an automatic
voice message system.

22:34.832 --> 22:36.251
When you are finished recording,

22:36.335 --> 22:38.798
you may hang up
or press pound for more options.

22:38.882 --> 22:40.761
[beep]

22:40.844 --> 22:41.930
Karolina...

22:44.644 --> 22:45.729
I need to...

22:47.315 --> 22:51.198
I'd like to, uh,
I'd like to see you.

22:51.281 --> 22:53.244
[breathing heavily]

22:53.327 --> 22:55.289
There's so many things
I need to...

22:56.291 --> 23:00.299
[laughs] There's so many things
I want to--I want to tell you.

23:01.343 --> 23:03.305
Um, but I'm afraid...

23:04.642 --> 23:07.355
I'm afraid there's
not too much more time.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.212
NICO:
Karolina?

23:22.761 --> 23:24.682
Oh, here you are...

23:24.765 --> 23:26.894
hiding from our uninvited guest.

23:27.813 --> 23:29.525
I get it.

23:29.608 --> 23:32.488
Molly loves him,
but I am not feeling it.

23:33.407 --> 23:35.077
KAROLINA: Well, maybe
we should give him a chance.

23:35.161 --> 23:38.000
He obviously knows way more
about living out here than we do.

23:39.002 --> 23:43.135
Hey, are you OK?
What's going on?

23:43.218 --> 23:44.220
What's that?

23:44.304 --> 23:46.183
KAROLINA:
Someone needs to make money,

23:46.266 --> 23:49.147
and I figured since Alex
isn't working with Darius anymore,

23:49.230 --> 23:51.318
you know,
I could get a job.

23:51.401 --> 23:52.946
-Doing what?
-KAROLINA: I was thinking

23:53.030 --> 23:55.493
what could I do
that wouldn't blow my cover,

23:55.577 --> 23:58.374
and I was like, "I know,
I'll go down to Hollywood Boulevard

23:58.457 --> 24:01.714
disguised as a fairytale princess
and see if any tourists want--"

24:01.798 --> 24:04.970
Wait. You're gonna
take Polaroids with little girls?

24:06.139 --> 24:07.601
Thought it was a good idea.

24:08.603 --> 24:12.861
I mean, you are basically
a real live Disney princess,

24:12.945 --> 24:16.368
but Hollywood Boulevard is like,
crawling with cops and cameras.

24:16.451 --> 24:19.499
Look, we aren't fugitives anymore,
and I don't think our parents

24:19.583 --> 24:21.420
are gonna be anywhere
near Hollywood Boulevard.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.631
That's true.

24:22.714 --> 24:26.096
We need money... and I want
to see what I can do to help.

24:30.856 --> 24:31.941
Hm?

24:35.532 --> 24:36.742
Fine.

24:37.995 --> 24:39.915
But if any dime store SpongeBob

24:39.999 --> 24:43.213
gets a little handsy with you,
I'm turning his ass into Plankton.

24:43.297 --> 24:45.259
-OK. I gotta go.
-NICO: OK.

24:45.342 --> 24:47.138
KAROLINA:
I'll be careful, I promise.

24:51.480 --> 24:52.941
I don't trust him.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.739
Well, if we can destroy the dig site,

24:55.822 --> 24:57.325
then we can get out of here
once and for all,

24:57.408 --> 25:00.414
which means Topher
isn't a problem anymore.

25:00.498 --> 25:01.959
Two birds, one motherboard.

25:02.043 --> 25:04.172
By "get out of here"
you mean go home?

25:04.255 --> 25:07.303
I didn't say that.
I mean get out of here.

25:07.386 --> 25:10.226
Stop California
from crackin' off into the ocean.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.940
-And we do that how?
-All I know is,

25:13.023 --> 25:15.152
it starts with disabling the security
at the dig site.

25:15.236 --> 25:18.116
-Using these guys?
-No. Using this thing.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.705
I aced my Ethical Hacking course
last semester.

25:20.789 --> 25:23.168
If we can mount
a directory traversal attack,

25:23.252 --> 25:26.717
storm the HTTP and gain access
to the restricted directories,

25:26.801 --> 25:29.723
we can set the whole thing in
self-destruct mode, Stuxnet-style.

25:29.807 --> 25:31.561
More like sucks-net.

25:31.644 --> 25:34.525
Sorry. It's a good plan,
but that was a great joke.

25:34.608 --> 25:37.321
Unfortunately,
it remains just a plan.

25:37.405 --> 25:41.037
One big problem. There is no way
that this old computer's

25:41.121 --> 25:43.208
gonna be able to take down
the security at the site.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.462
And that's on top
of another big problem--

25:45.505 --> 25:48.218
a homeless kid with yellow eyes
is squatting in our house.

25:48.302 --> 25:49.304
ALEX: Right.

25:54.022 --> 25:56.443
Maybe one big problem
can help us solve the other one.

25:57.696 --> 26:00.535
All I need is an 18-core,
36-thread processor chip.

26:00.619 --> 26:01.621
Oh, good.

26:01.704 --> 26:04.334
We have so many of those lying
around here in our ruined mansion.

26:04.417 --> 26:05.920
I know exactly where to find one.

26:06.004 --> 26:07.799
-Where? And how much is it?
-ALEX: It's free.

26:07.883 --> 26:10.847
But you are not gonna like
what we have to do to get it.

26:11.431 --> 26:13.143
We're goin' back to Atlas Academy.

26:13.226 --> 26:15.397
-What?
-GERT: Oh, my God.

26:16.567 --> 26:17.569
And what do we do with him?

26:18.320 --> 26:21.076
Topher? He's the one
that's gonna get us inside.

26:27.421 --> 26:29.760
[bell ringing]

26:31.555 --> 26:33.141
[coughing]

26:35.104 --> 26:37.108
[footsteps approach]

26:37.191 --> 26:39.905
-KAROLINA: Um, hi.
-JONAH: Thank you for meeting me.

26:41.116 --> 26:42.744
You brought your school books?

26:42.828 --> 26:46.836
I had to tell my friends something,
so I told them I was job hunting.

26:46.919 --> 26:48.171
Oh.

26:51.846 --> 26:53.140
[bell ringing]

26:55.144 --> 26:57.941
You know you're my only priority.
Right?

26:59.110 --> 27:00.279
Is that enough?

27:00.362 --> 27:02.241
No, I can't. That's not why I'm here.

27:02.324 --> 27:04.287
No, no, please, just take it all.

27:04.370 --> 27:05.372
I said no.

27:06.584 --> 27:09.255
You said you had something to tell me
and you didn't have much time.

27:09.338 --> 27:10.340
Are you sick?

27:11.176 --> 27:14.307
JONAH: I only get one chance to do
this right and I don't want to mess it up.

27:14.892 --> 27:17.981
KAROLINA: Do what?
I'm taking a real risk being here,

27:18.064 --> 27:21.029
and I want answers. Now.

27:21.112 --> 27:22.490
I hear you. And I'm--

27:22.574 --> 27:23.993
KAROLINA:
Don't hear me.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.454
Tell me.

27:27.208 --> 27:28.628
I can do better than that.

27:29.630 --> 27:31.049
Why don't I show you.

27:39.858 --> 27:40.860
DALE:
You don't think

27:40.944 --> 27:42.948
we could have parked
maybe a little bit closer, Stacey?

27:43.031 --> 27:45.995
Hon, it is only 50 yards away.
You have lived in California too long.

27:46.079 --> 27:49.168
May I remind you that there's
an industrial grade razor blade

27:49.252 --> 27:52.424
on this drone that could puncture
a donut hole in my ribs.

27:52.509 --> 27:55.557
Wow, hon, you're so irritable lately.

27:55.640 --> 27:58.311
Of course I am! We've spent
the last umpteen years of our lives--

27:58.395 --> 27:59.606
-Hey, how are you?
-STACEY: We're with Pride.

27:59.690 --> 28:01.777
--consorting with
morally ruined human beings

28:01.860 --> 28:03.071
who won't stop lying to us,

28:03.154 --> 28:04.575
and now the only chance
of getting our kids back

28:04.658 --> 28:06.537
is to stick a drone
into a hole of unknown depth,

28:06.620 --> 28:07.956
and take a biopsy
of whatever's down there

28:08.039 --> 28:09.041
so that we can kill someone.

28:09.876 --> 28:11.880
-Hey, buddy, how are you?
-STACEY: Leslie cleared us.

28:11.964 --> 28:15.429
In this case, I'd say irritation
is a context-appropriate emotion.

28:17.684 --> 28:18.853
-Breathe.
-I'm breathing!

28:18.936 --> 28:20.648
-OK.
-I'm sorry.

28:20.732 --> 28:23.904
-OK.
-It's just, I--

28:25.032 --> 28:26.869
I'm scared.

28:26.952 --> 28:28.581
You know, what if
this serum doesn't work?

28:28.664 --> 28:29.750
Hey.

28:32.338 --> 28:33.298
It's gonna work.

28:34.258 --> 28:35.762
How do you know?

28:35.845 --> 28:37.473
Because it has to.

28:51.627 --> 28:52.837
CHASE: Where are we going?

28:52.921 --> 28:54.633
GERT:
Are we jogging to Brentwood?

28:55.843 --> 28:57.722
-MOLLY: Awesome!
-Wait. Three cars?

28:57.806 --> 28:59.726
-We don't have the money for this.
-You don't need any.

28:59.810 --> 29:02.272
I got a gang of free vouchers from
a Hollywood Hills party I crashed.

29:02.356 --> 29:04.110
Alex, you and Gert
get in the first car.

29:04.193 --> 29:05.947
Chase, you go with Molly.

29:07.074 --> 29:09.078
And Nico, you're with me.

29:09.161 --> 29:11.499
Come on.
Your girlfriend isn't here anyway.

29:22.731 --> 29:25.402
I know you don't like me,
but I'm cool with it.

29:25.485 --> 29:29.118
It's not that I don't like you.
I don't trust you.

29:29.953 --> 29:32.332
I see that.
You're cold to me.

29:32.416 --> 29:34.588
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm not warm to anyone.

29:35.673 --> 29:38.888
-I like your honesty.
-I don't do it for you.

29:38.971 --> 29:41.769
-Maybe that's what I like about you.
-I don't really care what you like.

29:43.814 --> 29:45.818
What do you care about?

29:45.902 --> 29:47.279
Wicca?

29:47.362 --> 29:49.492
"Do what ye will, and ye harm none."

29:49.576 --> 29:50.953
What do you know about Wicca?

29:51.872 --> 29:54.084
I know what a spell is.

29:54.168 --> 29:58.051
When you take symbols and action,

29:58.134 --> 30:01.224
turn them into some... power.

30:01.307 --> 30:02.392
Something like that.

30:04.188 --> 30:06.819
Seriously, nobody gets that.

30:07.486 --> 30:08.531
I do.

30:12.371 --> 30:13.916
NICO:
I think, um...

30:14.500 --> 30:17.674
maybe... I misjudged you.

30:23.476 --> 30:24.855
Tell me something, though.

30:25.815 --> 30:27.777
What's in that vial
you carry around?

30:29.154 --> 30:32.369
Come on, now.
I've seen what you guys can do.

30:33.581 --> 30:36.670
Um... are all of you holding?

30:37.547 --> 30:38.716
Holding?

30:40.427 --> 30:41.638
You mean like with drugs?

30:41.722 --> 30:44.936
[laughs] Oh, I get it.
Playing dumb.

30:46.815 --> 30:49.863
OK, I got you. You want to keep
all your shit to yourself.

30:50.865 --> 30:52.660
It's cool.

30:52.744 --> 30:55.040
You want me to share with you,
don't ya?

30:56.585 --> 30:58.839
Because us kids
need to stick together.

30:59.423 --> 31:00.676
That's right.

31:02.095 --> 31:03.641
So we're friends now?

31:11.740 --> 31:13.409
[school bell ringing]

31:21.175 --> 31:22.219
ALEX: OK.

31:22.302 --> 31:24.390
We got 15 minutes while
everybody's in all-school assembly.

31:24.473 --> 31:26.143
I even miss all-school assembly.

31:28.524 --> 31:30.569
ALEX: Once you're inside,
straight down the hallway.

31:30.653 --> 31:32.699
-Then go up to the second floor.
-MOllY: Take the main staircase.

31:32.782 --> 31:35.245
-Shouldn't he take the side stairs?
-Then he'll run into the Vape Team.

31:35.328 --> 31:36.957
-The kids with vape pens.
-MOLLY: Oh, they're so annoying.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.253
-"Sick clouds, brah."
-You guys, stop.

31:39.336 --> 31:41.465
First door to your right
is the computer lab.

31:41.550 --> 31:43.094
Back of the room
there's a wood cabinet.

31:43.177 --> 31:44.764
Inside is a safe.

31:44.848 --> 31:47.520
19-3-26, right, left--

31:47.603 --> 31:49.189
Give me your phone,
I'll write it down.

31:54.450 --> 31:56.747
[tapping smartphone]

31:56.830 --> 31:58.499
Do not speak to anyone.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.045
Not that anyone here
has anything to say.

32:00.128 --> 32:02.717
-It's not that bad, Nico.
-It's not that good, either.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.136
Got it?

32:04.219 --> 32:05.890
I survived foster care, no?

32:05.973 --> 32:07.476
I think I can handle
a bunch of fresas.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.856
Fresas. It means spoiled rich kids.

32:09.939 --> 32:12.235
-Like us?
-Like we used to be.

32:26.013 --> 32:27.517
-[beeping]
-OK, it's almost here.

32:27.600 --> 32:28.769
Got the serum?

32:28.852 --> 32:32.150
DALE: Release the biopsy
from the cylinder...

32:32.985 --> 32:35.825
inject it with the serum, and...

32:35.908 --> 32:37.870
We can finally move on with our lives.

32:37.954 --> 32:39.373
If it works.

32:52.525 --> 32:54.153
Careful.

32:54.988 --> 32:57.409
Eww. What is that smell?

32:57.492 --> 33:01.000
DALE: It's malodorous,
yet not completely unfamiliar.

33:01.083 --> 33:02.670
A very mature Stilton?

33:03.254 --> 33:05.676
Maybe something from
the Limburger family? Ugh.

33:05.759 --> 33:09.391
The body wall looks tessellated.
Calcite microcrystals, maybe?

33:09.474 --> 33:10.936
Definitely organic.

33:11.020 --> 33:12.607
That smell is
the very essence of decay.

33:12.690 --> 33:15.361
Which means whatever the serum
does to this thing,

33:15.445 --> 33:16.656
it'll also do to Jonah.

33:17.199 --> 33:20.205
Well... here goes.

33:29.515 --> 33:31.561
STACEY:
It's turning black!

33:32.395 --> 33:34.024
Necrosis! Yes!

33:34.107 --> 33:35.903
-Sweetie!
-Oh, it's great!

33:37.155 --> 33:39.619
-[rumbling]
-DALE: Hold on a second.

33:39.702 --> 33:41.163
It's an earthquake!

33:44.378 --> 33:46.423
-Another earthquake?!
-Is this it? Is this the one?

33:46.508 --> 33:48.344
-I've got you. Stay calm.
-NICO: Nobody move.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.975
-Topher's stuck in there!
-[rumbling stops]

33:52.561 --> 33:54.983
-[alarm wailing]
-OK, that... wasn't too bad.

33:56.026 --> 33:58.114
-You OK?
-Not even in theory.

33:58.197 --> 33:59.784
-I loved it.
-Okay, that alarm means we got

33:59.867 --> 34:02.122
about two seconds
before earthquake protocol kicks in.

34:02.205 --> 34:03.792
P.A.: All students proceed
to the parking lot...

34:03.875 --> 34:06.380
-There's Topher!
-...for a mandatory head count.

34:06.463 --> 34:07.925
-We gotta get that computer.
-We gotta get Topher!

34:08.009 --> 34:09.804
OK, come on, you guys,
we're going in.

34:09.887 --> 34:11.683
Keep your heads down,
we'll disappear into the chaos.

34:11.766 --> 34:12.851
Chase and I will head to the lab.

34:12.935 --> 34:14.522
NICO: Molly,
we'll go to the parking lot.

34:14.605 --> 34:15.774
And Gert...

34:16.860 --> 34:17.987
Gert?

34:23.748 --> 34:25.878
-Gertrude Yorkes?
-Oh, my God!

34:25.960 --> 34:27.797
Sorry! Wow!

34:27.882 --> 34:30.554
You really startled me.
Whoa. Hang on a second.

34:30.637 --> 34:31.889
Is this your first day back?

34:33.225 --> 34:34.812
Yes. Yes!

34:34.896 --> 34:37.108
And that earthquake...

34:37.192 --> 34:39.029
really got me shook.

34:39.614 --> 34:40.824
Sorry about the pun.

34:40.908 --> 34:45.583
It just really shows
how emotionally fragile I am.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.797
Which is why I actually came
to see if you have

34:47.880 --> 34:49.675
any of my anxiety meds here?

34:49.759 --> 34:53.850
There--There should be a big
bottle of them with my name on it...

34:53.934 --> 34:55.771
somewhere back there.

34:55.853 --> 34:58.902
Usually I'm notified when kids who've
been through something traumatic

34:58.985 --> 35:00.196
return to school.

35:00.279 --> 35:02.367
You-- Oh, you mean the fugitive thing?

35:02.450 --> 35:05.708
Hmm. Um, that probably sounded
a lot worse than it actually was.

35:05.791 --> 35:08.212
We were never actually
suspected of murder.

35:08.295 --> 35:10.592
You know, fake news.

35:11.720 --> 35:13.305
Can you check
on my medicine, though?

35:13.389 --> 35:15.059
Just a moment.

35:19.317 --> 35:23.033
[Gert muttering]

35:26.081 --> 35:28.043
[dialing phone]

35:29.839 --> 35:33.513
WILSON: Hi, it's Nurse Wilson,
I've got Gertrude Yorkes here.

35:35.517 --> 35:37.061
TINA: They're reporting
the earthquake as a 5.1.

35:37.145 --> 35:38.815
It's big, but not the Big One.

35:38.899 --> 35:40.527
It's another one.
That's all I need to know.

35:40.611 --> 35:41.654
We're running out of time.

35:41.738 --> 35:43.032
Is the epicenter near the dig site?

35:43.115 --> 35:44.994
South of downtown.

35:45.077 --> 35:48.710
-[all devices beeping]
-Someone's seen the kids.

35:49.712 --> 35:51.925
Look where it's coming from.

36:00.149 --> 36:02.696
It's locked.
There's no other way in.

36:02.780 --> 36:04.199
I knew I should have
brought the Fistigons.

36:04.282 --> 36:06.203
We agreed everybody's
going civilian for this one.

36:06.286 --> 36:08.290
Okay? Even Nico.
It's Atlas Academy, remember?

36:08.374 --> 36:10.419
Wait, I know someone
with a master key.

36:10.504 --> 36:12.340
They stole it freshman year
and have had it ever since.

36:12.423 --> 36:13.677
But everybody's
out in the parking lot.

36:13.760 --> 36:15.179
Eh... not this person.

36:15.263 --> 36:17.183
And I know right where to find 'em.
Come on.

36:17.935 --> 36:19.730
No way am I doing in here
without consent.

36:19.814 --> 36:21.860
It's gender neutral now,
thanks to Gert's petition.

36:21.943 --> 36:24.030
Sorry. I love Gert,
but only girls use this bathroom.

36:24.114 --> 36:25.199
Just guard the door.
I'm goin' in.

36:26.578 --> 36:29.124
-[camera clicking]
-Hey.

36:30.293 --> 36:31.546
Are you serious?

36:31.629 --> 36:33.173
I thought you were, like,
a fugitive from justice.

36:33.257 --> 36:35.094
-Not anymore.
-It's too bad.

36:35.177 --> 36:37.015
Outlaw was a good look on you.

36:37.098 --> 36:38.935
Why are you back here, anyway?
This place is so boring.

36:39.019 --> 36:41.189
I have a new appreciation
for Atlas Academy.

36:41.273 --> 36:42.275
And boring.

36:42.358 --> 36:46.450
Hm. What do you think about
hashtag EarthquakeBitches?

36:46.534 --> 36:47.536
Is that too much?

36:47.620 --> 36:49.665
I think you're gonna throw
massive "likes" up on the scoreboard.

36:49.749 --> 36:50.876
EIFFEL:
I think so too!

36:50.959 --> 36:53.798
-[camera clicking]
-CHASE: Um, hey...

36:53.882 --> 36:55.426
I need a favor.

36:55.510 --> 36:58.516
Aiding and abetting
a former murder suspect?

37:00.061 --> 37:02.482
Sure. But I'll need something
in return, obvi.

37:02.566 --> 37:03.568
Name it.

37:06.532 --> 37:08.662
Oh, my God, there you are.
Where have you been?

37:08.745 --> 37:10.707
I tried to score some meds
out of the nurse's office.

37:10.791 --> 37:12.711
Nurse Nightmare?
Why would you risk that?

37:12.795 --> 37:15.676
-Did anyone see you?
-Uh... no.

37:16.552 --> 37:19.725
No! I don't know.
Possibly. You never really know.

37:19.809 --> 37:21.228
We should probably hurry, though.

37:21.311 --> 37:22.856
What are you doing outside
of the gender neutral bathroom?

37:22.940 --> 37:25.236
Waiting for Chase. He's in there
getting a key to the computer lab.

37:25.319 --> 37:26.572
He should be out any second.

37:26.656 --> 37:28.075
Can I just quickly note
how weird it is

37:28.158 --> 37:29.787
that I just used to walk
up and down there halls

37:29.870 --> 37:31.874
taking central heat
and air conditioning for granted?

37:31.958 --> 37:33.002
-[raps on door]
-Dude, hurry!

37:33.085 --> 37:36.718
-I'm gonna go in.
-No, no, you might not want to do that.

37:36.801 --> 37:38.429
EIFFEL:
Bye, Chase!

37:38.513 --> 37:40.851
Hi, Alvin. Other person.

37:44.149 --> 37:46.028
ALEX:
Come on, let's go.

37:46.111 --> 37:47.405
CHASE:
Come on.

37:50.327 --> 37:52.206
JONAH:
The earthquake knocked out the lights.

37:52.290 --> 37:53.710
Traffic's all backed up.

37:54.920 --> 37:56.632
[Jonah coughing]

37:57.551 --> 37:59.345
-What's up?
-Move it!

37:59.930 --> 38:01.433
WOMAN: Let's give it a try!

38:01.517 --> 38:02.853
JONAH:
We can walk from here.

38:03.437 --> 38:04.732
Where are we going?

38:04.815 --> 38:07.571
JONAH: Look, the earthquake,
it didn't come out of nowhere.

38:08.782 --> 38:10.409
Something's happened.

38:10.493 --> 38:11.704
We need to get there.

38:12.706 --> 38:13.958
Please.

38:19.845 --> 38:20.931
KAROLINA:
I'm scared.

38:26.609 --> 38:30.157
Karolina...
you don't have to come with me.

38:34.124 --> 38:35.919
But there is a trade-off.

38:37.881 --> 38:40.554
What I am... is what you are.

38:40.637 --> 38:42.599
Without me, you...

38:44.352 --> 38:46.064
you'll never know your whole self.

38:47.233 --> 38:49.112
Who you really are.

38:49.195 --> 38:50.615
It's your choice.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.794
[chatter]

39:09.027 --> 39:10.739
NICO:
They're gonna catch him.

39:10.822 --> 39:11.824
MOLLY:
Topher!

39:12.408 --> 39:14.329
We'll never get to him
without being seen.

39:14.412 --> 39:15.790
We can't just sit here
and do nothing.

39:15.874 --> 39:17.418
I'm gonna go get him.

39:17.501 --> 39:18.546
Wait, wait. Molly.

39:20.007 --> 39:21.009
Our parents.

39:22.220 --> 39:24.683
What are they doing here?
We gotta get out of here.

39:31.906 --> 39:32.991
All right, let's go.

39:38.628 --> 39:39.838
MOLLY:
Our parents are here!

39:39.922 --> 39:42.051
They just rolled into the parking lot
in their motorcade of evil.

39:42.134 --> 39:43.220
ALEX:
This'll take one second. Hold on.

39:45.642 --> 39:47.103
-Too late.
-CHASE: They're in the building.

39:47.186 --> 39:49.023
-MOLLY: Run! Run!
-ALEX: Shit.

39:51.278 --> 39:53.616
Wait, Molly.
Over here. The secret stairs.

39:54.785 --> 39:56.037
-It's locked.
-CHASE: Alex.

39:56.121 --> 39:57.206
ALEX: I got it.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.421
The earthquake happened
right when we injected the serum.

40:21.505 --> 40:23.175
Do you think there's any connection
between the two?

40:23.258 --> 40:24.302
DALE: I do.

40:25.597 --> 40:28.561
Oy! They saw us.
Do you think they saw us?

40:28.644 --> 40:30.648
They definitely saw us.
They're looking right at us.

40:31.316 --> 40:32.527
We gotta go!

40:33.278 --> 40:35.324
That was Gert and Molly's parents.
What are they doing here?

40:35.407 --> 40:36.827
We should check and see
if Karolina's OK.

40:36.911 --> 40:38.497
And she probably knows
how Gert and Molly are doing.

40:38.581 --> 40:40.334
DALE:
That is not a chance we can take.

40:40.417 --> 40:42.004
STACEY:
Slow down, this is not safe!

40:43.423 --> 40:46.137
JONAH: I think we just found out
the cause of this earthquake.

40:46.221 --> 40:48.100
-What if they tell my mom?
-Your mother can't hurt you.

40:48.183 --> 40:50.772
Nobody can.
I protect you from now on.

40:54.195 --> 40:55.197
NICO: Come on.

40:57.744 --> 40:58.788
TOPHER: Ay, dios.

40:58.871 --> 41:01.042
Where were you, fam?
Mission accomplished.

41:01.126 --> 41:02.546
I thought we weren't supposed
to say that anymore.

41:02.629 --> 41:03.714
How did you get this?

41:03.798 --> 41:05.050
I walked into the computer lab.

41:05.134 --> 41:07.514
Dialed 19-26-3.

41:07.597 --> 41:09.852
And here you go.
You're welcome.

41:09.935 --> 41:11.856
MOLLY: That's amazing.
You rock, cuz.

41:11.939 --> 41:14.570
-Nice work, man.
-NICO: Not bad.

41:18.828 --> 41:21.291
MOLLY:
Chase, you coming?

41:24.798 --> 41:26.677
[birds singing]

41:26.760 --> 41:29.933
The best thing was when
we finally get over the wall,

41:30.017 --> 41:31.937
and there you were,
holding the computer.

41:32.021 --> 41:34.610
It was all Alex. I was just
following his directions.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.488
CHASE:
Sorry I gave you such a hard time.

41:36.572 --> 41:38.868
-You totally came through.
-TOPHER: It's OK, I know how it is.

41:38.951 --> 41:40.622
Who can you trust, right?

41:40.705 --> 41:43.043
-How's the hotspot working?
-Game-changer.

41:43.126 --> 41:44.922
I've already started flooding
the security at the dig site

41:45.005 --> 41:46.717
with multiple spoofed addresses.

41:46.800 --> 41:48.679
Keep the phone.
I can get another one.

41:48.763 --> 41:51.059
No problema.
Consider it rent.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.856
Thank you. Seriously, we couldn't
have done this without you.

41:53.940 --> 41:55.944
-I told you.
-That's how we roll, right, hermanita?

41:56.027 --> 41:56.946
Sí, hermano.

41:59.826 --> 42:01.539
Do you think we can
go back to Atlas Academy

42:01.622 --> 42:03.291
and maybe this time
we break into the nurse's office?

42:05.295 --> 42:07.424
ALEX: Hey, one thing
I'm still wondering about.

42:07.509 --> 42:08.844
How come your eyes turned yellow?

42:13.771 --> 42:16.067
I think it maybe runs in my family.
I don't know.

42:19.323 --> 42:20.325
Can I talk to you?

42:21.829 --> 42:23.248
Alone?

42:41.827 --> 42:43.288
NICO:
Is this what you were looking for?

42:46.210 --> 42:48.799
TOPHER: So that's why
you were so friendly in the car.

42:53.809 --> 42:56.189
-I'm just playing.
-I'm not.

42:57.024 --> 42:58.736
This is why your eyes turn yellow,
isn't it?

43:03.663 --> 43:06.125
Is that mine, or are you
finally ready to share?

43:06.209 --> 43:08.421
I'm finally ready for the truth.

43:08.506 --> 43:10.718
You're nothing like Molly.

43:10.802 --> 43:12.806
You get high off this stuff, don't you?

43:13.933 --> 43:15.227
So what is this?

43:15.310 --> 43:16.605
And where the hell did you get it?

43:25.873 --> 43:27.459
JONAH:
Here we are.

43:27.544 --> 43:29.923
KAROLINA:
This is what you wanted to show me?

43:30.006 --> 43:32.386
As you know, I've been here before.

43:33.681 --> 43:35.727
I want to thank you, Karolina.

43:38.314 --> 43:42.322
You are truly everything
I could ever dream of in a daughter.

43:44.368 --> 43:45.913
This day has been an honor.

43:47.917 --> 43:51.257
You are exactly who you need to be
for where we're going.

43:51.340 --> 43:52.927
Where are we going?

43:53.011 --> 43:56.685
I told you I'd show you everything,
and now I will.

43:58.146 --> 44:00.025
[Jonah sighs]

44:01.570 --> 44:03.406
Trust me.

44:03.490 --> 44:05.118
I don't know if I can trust you.

44:11.799 --> 44:13.677
I'm going to trust myself.
