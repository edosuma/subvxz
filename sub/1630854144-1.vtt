35:11.680 --> 35:14.285
- Well, that doesn't mean that
you can take her away from me,

35:14.320 --> 35:17.783

- Of course it does.

35:17.818 --> 35:19.818
Look.
- Oh.

35:19.853 --> 35:20.951

35:20.986 --> 35:22.150

35:22.185 --> 35:23.052
What kind of money, Cuda?
- I--I'm sorry.

35:23.087 --> 35:24.460
I'm sorry.

35:24.495 --> 35:26.792
- You're stained
with the life that you live.

35:26.827 --> 35:28.024
A criminal.

35:28.059 --> 35:30.499
- Well, you know,
I came here because--

35:30.534 --> 35:31.863
- I know.

35:31.898 --> 35:33.238
Lola's birthday.
- That's right.

35:33.273 --> 35:34.536
- Her sweet 16.

35:34.571 --> 35:35.966
- And I would like
to buy her something,

35:36.001 --> 35:37.308
take her for dinner,

35:37.343 --> 35:38.705
you know, just do
normal things that a father

35:38.740 --> 35:39.838
would do for his daughter.

35:39.873 --> 35:42.038
- I know you're hurting,

35:42.073 --> 35:44.810

You got locked up.

35:44.845 --> 35:46.647

36:05.635 --> 36:08.669

36:08.704 --> 36:12.167

rivalled some of the greats.

36:12.202 --> 36:15.346
