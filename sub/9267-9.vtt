WEBVTT

00:00.409 --> 00:02.810
I wanted to let you guys know
I'm going back to school.

00:02.844 --> 00:06.214
[Knock at door]

00:06.248 --> 00:09.049
When you want to go out,
give me a call, okay?

00:09.268 --> 00:10.869
Anything...
carrier pigeon.

00:10.903 --> 00:12.570
I believe you have a future.

00:12.605 --> 00:13.972
You're not gonna make
a difference.

00:14.006 --> 00:16.608
- I am who I am.
- I don't know about that.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.109
Oklahoma Tech
is a great school.

00:18.144 --> 00:19.611
You want us to come
up there tomorrow?

00:19.645 --> 00:22.113
- Mm-hmm.
- Is that even allowed?

00:22.148 --> 00:23.348
As long as it's not
an official visit.

00:23.382 --> 00:25.784
I'm sure your father
has your best interest.

00:25.818 --> 00:27.252
That offer, it's worth nothing.

00:27.286 --> 00:30.088
You're knocking
on the wrong doors.

00:32.558 --> 00:33.958
Ugh!

00:37.263 --> 00:39.698
The dream is over, folks.

00:39.732 --> 00:41.900
There will be
no undefeated season

00:41.934 --> 00:43.668
for the East Dillon Lions
this year.

00:43.703 --> 00:48.740
Tonight we saw a Lions team
in total disarray.

00:48.774 --> 00:50.775
All the good work
of the last eight games gone

00:50.810 --> 00:54.979
in one hugely disappointing
performance.

00:55.014 --> 00:57.615
Really?

01:02.488 --> 01:05.090
Five minutes...
That's all I get?

01:05.123 --> 01:06.658
None of y'all got no heart.

01:06.692 --> 01:08.293
We had momentum.
We were coming back.

01:08.327 --> 01:09.661
We didn't have
any damn momentum.

01:09.695 --> 01:10.829
- We had momentum.
- No, we did not, man.

01:10.863 --> 01:11.930
You have to put points
on the board

01:11.964 --> 01:13.031
before you can start
coming back.

01:13.065 --> 01:14.599
- It was your fault.
- Hotshot red 22.

01:14.633 --> 01:16.000
Tink, you better make sure you
get in that hole.

01:16.035 --> 01:17.502
Cafferty, what are you doing
out here right now?

01:17.536 --> 01:18.770
You're not supposed to be here.

01:18.804 --> 01:20.205
Yes, I am. He called Eagle.
I heard him, man.

01:20.239 --> 01:22.607
- We're doing hotshot, idiot!
- What's he doing?

01:22.641 --> 01:24.375
Luke, what are you doing?
Come back here!

01:24.410 --> 01:25.443
Hotshot...
Get off the field, man.

01:25.478 --> 01:27.679
We got too many people
on the field.

01:27.713 --> 01:28.947
Hotshot red 22 on one.

01:28.981 --> 01:30.648
Ready, break.
[Whistle blows]

01:30.683 --> 01:32.350
[Crowd booing]

01:32.384 --> 01:34.052
That penalty cost us
the first down.

01:34.086 --> 01:35.420
That wasn't my fault, man!

01:35.454 --> 01:37.455
There's 11 people
on the field, not 12. 11.

01:37.490 --> 01:39.023
That's not my fault, man.
I was freakin' exhausted

01:39.058 --> 01:40.959
because defense was on the field
the whole damn night.

01:40.993 --> 01:42.894
That's why,
'cause you were sucking ass.

01:42.928 --> 01:44.696
Hut, hike!

01:49.001 --> 01:51.369
[Crowd roars] Damn it!

01:51.403 --> 01:53.571
- [Booing]
- Defense, get ready.

01:53.606 --> 01:55.740
- This is getting old, QB.
- Do your job! Do your job!

01:55.775 --> 01:58.143
- Y'all do your job.
- What?

01:58.177 --> 02:01.146
Y'all do your job.
Stop worrying about me!

02:01.180 --> 02:02.480
Turnovers, man... We can't
win a game with turnovers.

02:02.515 --> 02:03.615
Cary busted his route.

02:03.649 --> 02:04.716
I threw the ball
where it was supposed to be at.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.985
You had three, dude...
Three picks.

02:07.019 --> 02:08.586
Not one of those was your...

02:08.621 --> 02:10.020
Because nobody
knows the damn plays!

02:10.055 --> 02:12.257
Hold up!
[Overlapping arguing]

02:12.291 --> 02:14.159
I'm the quarterback.
I'm supposed to know!

02:14.193 --> 02:15.827
You're supposed to!

02:15.861 --> 02:17.028
He gets one call all night,

02:17.062 --> 02:18.530
and he can't even get
that right.

02:18.564 --> 02:20.865
Yeah, I know.
It goes inside on the reverse.

02:20.900 --> 02:23.034
- It goes outside.
- Look at the play book.

02:23.068 --> 02:25.436
I got the play book.
I know the plays. You don't...

02:25.471 --> 02:27.138
Coach...

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:37.817 --> 02:40.185
Y'all get your stuff together

02:40.219 --> 02:42.554
and get out
of our field house right now.

02:42.588 --> 02:45.890
Get the hell out
of our field house right now.

02:45.925 --> 02:48.126
Pick it up and go.

02:48.160 --> 02:52.030
A defense that gave up
a season high 14 first downs

02:52.064 --> 02:54.699
and two missed field goals
to boot.

02:54.733 --> 02:57.569
These Lions look nothing like
the team of the last two months.

02:57.603 --> 02:59.037
Maybe we counted our chickens
too soon, folks.

02:59.071 --> 03:02.707
And maybe those chickens
have come to roost.

03:02.741 --> 03:04.676
Coach Taylor's
been riding this team

03:04.710 --> 03:06.578
with a loose rein all season,

03:06.612 --> 03:08.713
and tonight we saw
the result of that.

03:08.747 --> 03:10.748
That wasn't a team
out there, folks.

03:10.783 --> 03:12.951
It was a bunch
of individuals trying to...

03:12.985 --> 03:15.620
[clatter, radio stops]

03:15.654 --> 03:18.156
[Door slams]

03:22.661 --> 03:24.362
You all good in there?

03:24.396 --> 03:27.298
Yeah.
I, uh...

03:27.333 --> 03:30.435
I just want to let you know
I had a really good weekend.

03:30.469 --> 03:33.471
[Chuckles]
Uh, me... me too.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.673
And I know that
I was supposed to leave today,

03:35.708 --> 03:38.243
but I'd really love
to see more of the city,

03:38.277 --> 03:39.777
and I don't really have
anything

03:39.812 --> 03:43.181
I have to urgently be back for.

03:43.215 --> 03:44.616
Okay.

03:44.650 --> 03:48.086
Um, so you... you want
to stay longer, then?

03:48.120 --> 03:49.520
Yeah, if that's okay.

03:49.555 --> 03:50.889
That's good.
That's fine.

03:50.923 --> 03:52.857
- That'll be fine.
- Okay.

03:52.892 --> 03:55.960
If we win on Friday,
we're in the playoffs.

03:55.995 --> 03:58.763
But even if we lose,
we still got a chance

03:58.797 --> 04:01.266
- if Meade beats Laribee.
- So we make it even if we lose.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.401
We're not gonna lose.

04:03.435 --> 04:04.836
That's not what I meant.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.838
Coach, is there something
you want to say?

04:06.872 --> 04:10.541
You haven't said
a damn word all morning.

04:10.576 --> 04:14.212
Look, we all know the problem.

04:14.246 --> 04:18.048
It's Vince.
He's lost this team.

04:22.454 --> 04:32.728
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrected by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

05:14.640 --> 05:15.807
- Hey, Epyck.
- Hi.

05:15.841 --> 05:18.009
Come on in.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.305
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

05:22.070 --> 05:24.171
What brings you down here
to the dungeon?

05:24.206 --> 05:26.075
[Drumming on leg]

05:27.796 --> 05:31.466
I suck at Texas history.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.934
And I have a test on Friday,

05:32.968 --> 05:34.536
and if I don't get
at least a B-minus,

05:34.570 --> 05:36.204
I'm gonna flunk.

05:36.238 --> 05:40.909
Well, we'll keep our fingers
crossed for that b-minus.

05:40.943 --> 05:43.745
And Nicky Diaz says if I fail,

05:43.779 --> 05:45.246
then I'm gonna have
to repeat the tenth grade.

05:45.281 --> 05:46.447
That's not true.

05:46.482 --> 05:49.217
One "F" is not gonna
hold you back.

05:49.251 --> 05:51.486
Are you working on it
in the after-school program?

05:51.520 --> 05:52.787
Mrs. Sachs hates me.

05:52.821 --> 05:54.455
She's always telling me
to shut up and stuff.

05:54.490 --> 05:57.392
Epyck...
No, she doesn't.

05:57.426 --> 05:59.928
She doesn't like me.

06:02.464 --> 06:04.432
Would you like me to help you?

06:10.039 --> 06:12.373
Yeah, I guess so.

06:12.408 --> 06:15.043
I'd be happy to.

06:17.613 --> 06:21.716
[Overlapping chatter]

06:21.750 --> 06:23.952
It's not a big deal.

06:23.986 --> 06:25.987
What do you mean
it's not a big deal?

06:26.021 --> 06:27.589
I mean, look at everything
that we're doing.

06:27.623 --> 06:29.324
It's a big deal.
It's your last home game.

06:29.358 --> 06:30.625
You know what it is?
It's for moms and dads.

06:30.659 --> 06:32.860
So they can be like, "my little
baby boy is graduating.

06:32.895 --> 06:34.796
"This is the last time
I'll see him

06:34.830 --> 06:36.097
in his cute little
Lion uniform."

06:36.131 --> 06:37.432
That's what it is.

06:37.466 --> 06:39.067
But it's the last time
I'm gonna see you

06:39.101 --> 06:41.169
in your cute little
Lion uniform too.

06:41.203 --> 06:44.072
Come on, I'll take you out
after the game.

06:44.106 --> 06:46.574
I want to do
something nice for you.

06:46.609 --> 06:48.409
This is nice.

06:48.444 --> 06:49.911
Yeah, but something
really nice.

06:49.945 --> 06:54.249
You know, like,
this whole starting-over thing.

06:54.283 --> 06:59.988
My mom and dad
are really excited about this.

07:00.022 --> 07:02.190
And she really wants
to take me out to dinner

07:02.224 --> 07:03.858
after the game.

07:03.892 --> 07:05.526
And I don't think that,
you know...

07:05.561 --> 07:08.229
No, no, no. Yeah.
I completely understand.

07:08.264 --> 07:10.398
Okay.
Seriously?

07:10.432 --> 07:13.368
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:14.470 --> 07:15.603
Thank you.
You're the best.

07:15.638 --> 07:17.905
I can't argue with that.

07:17.940 --> 07:19.574
- Mm-hmm.
- Bye.

07:24.113 --> 07:26.781
Last week's game
pretty much sums it up.

07:26.815 --> 07:29.017
That's not who we are.

07:29.051 --> 07:32.220
It's sure as hell not
what we're capable of...

07:32.254 --> 07:33.488
Pretty much
a complete breakdown

07:33.522 --> 07:35.923
of everything
that we've learned together.

07:35.958 --> 07:38.426
This Friday we got fort hood.

07:38.460 --> 07:41.596
They're the next thing
standing in our way.

07:41.630 --> 07:43.765
But let me tell you this.

07:43.799 --> 07:47.068
In my gut,
I think there's only one thing

07:47.102 --> 07:50.538
standing between us
and the playoffs,

07:50.572 --> 07:52.674
and it's not our opponents.

07:52.708 --> 07:56.277
It's ourselves.

07:56.312 --> 07:57.945
I'm not gonna let that happen.

07:57.980 --> 08:00.615
You're not gonna let
that happen.

08:00.649 --> 08:02.583
Y'all have spilled
too much sweat and blood

08:02.618 --> 08:05.153
on this damn piece of dirt
out here to allow it.

08:05.187 --> 08:08.990
Vince, let Luke have
that jersey for today.

08:09.024 --> 08:11.225
Let's go, coach.
Break 'em down.

08:11.260 --> 08:13.795
- Let's go to work, boys.
- What? Wait, what? Play QB?

08:13.829 --> 08:16.464
Let's go, defense.
Let's go, let's go!

08:23.005 --> 08:24.639
Hustle up, 44.
Here we go.

08:24.673 --> 08:25.673
Hey, coach...

08:25.708 --> 08:28.443
Hey, you're putting Luke at QB?

08:28.477 --> 08:30.345
Yeah, we're gonna keep
the wildcat option open.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.013
Coach, be... be serious.
What are you doing?

08:32.047 --> 08:33.448
Hey, you know what?
Will you do me a favor?

08:33.482 --> 08:34.816
What?

08:34.850 --> 08:36.317
From now on, when you're
out here on this field,

08:36.352 --> 08:37.618
you don't talk back to me.

08:37.653 --> 08:39.253
You want to come to my office,
you got questions,

08:39.288 --> 08:41.823
something you want to ask me,
that'd be the time to do it.

08:41.857 --> 08:45.626
I'll give you
all the time in the world.

08:48.797 --> 08:50.431
This is really cute, Evie,

08:50.466 --> 08:51.866
but, um, I don't think
there's a back to it.

08:51.900 --> 08:55.336
Yeah, that's
the whole point, baby.

08:55.371 --> 08:57.772
- Hey, like my new outfit?
- I feel like I'm gonna puke.

08:57.806 --> 09:00.174
- It's not that bad.
- Wait. Is fat Jack out there?

09:00.209 --> 09:02.643
No, like, for real sick.

09:02.678 --> 09:04.846
This sucks.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.514
There's, like,
a thousand tables out there,

09:06.548 --> 09:08.149
and everybody's using
a credit card.

09:08.183 --> 09:09.450
She's waiting tonight.

09:09.485 --> 09:11.552
We have to do it once a week.

09:11.587 --> 09:14.555
I should go home and get
into a bath and crawl into bed.

09:14.590 --> 09:16.758
- So go.
- Leave.

09:16.792 --> 09:18.626
I can't.
We're short-staffed.

09:18.660 --> 09:21.329
Pepper would kill me.

09:21.363 --> 09:23.865
I could take your shift.

09:23.899 --> 09:26.300
What? I'm serious.
I've waited tables before.

09:26.335 --> 09:28.369
Yeah, I love it.

09:28.404 --> 09:30.705
Not gonna happen.

09:30.739 --> 09:33.174
Oh, come on, you feel
like crap, and I can do this.

09:33.208 --> 09:34.375
I could use the cash anyways.

09:34.410 --> 09:36.644
Uh-uh.

09:36.678 --> 09:38.146
Come on, Eddie's not
even here tonight.

09:38.180 --> 09:39.881
Donna's working behind the bar.
We love her.

09:39.915 --> 09:42.817
Yeah, we love her,
dream crusher.

09:42.851 --> 09:44.185
The girl should have won
a car last week.

09:44.219 --> 09:45.853
At least let her
make some cash.

09:45.888 --> 09:47.321
I'll take her home later.

09:47.356 --> 09:49.891
She's safe with me.

09:51.427 --> 09:53.728
I told you coach
was gonna be pissed off

09:53.762 --> 09:54.896
I missed that practice, right?

09:54.930 --> 09:58.099
- Yeah, man, but so what?
- So what?

09:58.133 --> 09:59.734
This whole thing was your idea.

09:59.768 --> 10:00.902
You said nothing
was gonna happen.

10:00.936 --> 10:04.472
Yeah, I know I did.

10:04.506 --> 10:07.442
Man, look, what... what did he say
when you told him why?

10:07.476 --> 10:11.012

20:11.846 --> 20:14.248
I missed you too.

20:19.287 --> 20:22.523
So...

20:22.557 --> 20:25.626
I kind of have something
I need to tell you,

20:25.660 --> 20:30.130
and I don't want you
to freak out.

20:30.165 --> 20:31.298
Okay.

20:33.301 --> 20:34.701
I...

20:34.736 --> 20:38.806
Had an affair
with a T.A. at my school.

20:43.745 --> 20:47.147
And he was married.

20:47.182 --> 20:49.817
And there was just
this... this...

20:49.851 --> 20:52.853
Big mess.

20:57.325 --> 20:58.959
Aren't you gonna say something?

20:58.993 --> 21:00.794
What do you want me to say?

21:00.829 --> 21:02.596
I don't know.
Are... are you mad?

21:02.630 --> 21:04.331
Are you...?

21:04.365 --> 21:05.833
Yes, Julie, I'm mad.

21:05.867 --> 21:08.235
I'm furious.
I'm very disappointed in you.

21:08.269 --> 21:11.705
I mean, it's... it's fine.
It's fine.

21:11.739 --> 21:14.508
Well, just my parents
got super pissed off.

21:14.542 --> 21:16.076
Yeah, well,
those are your parents.

21:16.111 --> 21:18.946
I'm not your parents, okay?

21:18.980 --> 21:21.381
Look, it's not like
we were together or anything.

21:21.416 --> 21:25.018
You didn't cheat on me.

21:25.053 --> 21:27.554
It's fine.

21:27.589 --> 21:29.256
But...

21:29.290 --> 21:32.059
I mean, I hope
this doesn't freak you out,

21:32.093 --> 21:34.328
but I don't know, I just...

21:34.362 --> 21:39.800
I think maybe that
you and I need to, um...

21:39.834 --> 21:41.435
We need to go get breakfast,

21:41.469 --> 21:44.338
'cause I'm hungry.

21:44.372 --> 21:47.040
And there's a very good
bagel place down the street.

21:47.075 --> 21:49.576
- Bagels it is.
- Bagels... All right.

21:49.611 --> 21:51.745
Here we go.

22:03.458 --> 22:06.593
[Overlapping chatter]

22:12.433 --> 22:15.269
Hey, coach.

22:26.247 --> 22:27.514
Excuse me.

22:29.817 --> 22:30.984
What's up?

22:31.019 --> 22:32.619
You're benched for Friday.

22:32.654 --> 22:34.021
I'm what?

22:34.055 --> 22:35.656
I ask you to do
one simple thing for this team,

22:35.690 --> 22:36.957
and you can't even do that.

22:36.991 --> 22:39.459
- You're benched for Friday.
- Man, I hate snitches.

22:39.494 --> 22:41.028
You know what? You're gonna
show up for practice.

22:41.062 --> 22:42.462
You'll lift your weights.

22:42.497 --> 22:44.665
You'll come to the game,
but you're not playing Friday.

22:44.699 --> 22:47.100
See, you're trying
to mess up my future.

22:47.135 --> 22:49.102
There you go,
opening that mouth again.

22:49.137 --> 22:51.939
You want to shoot
for two weeks?

22:51.973 --> 22:53.106
No, sir.

22:53.141 --> 22:57.678
That's what I like to hear.

23:09.057 --> 23:10.591
Hey, can I talk to you?

23:10.625 --> 23:14.094
Yeah. Golly, you know,
talk about budget cuts.

23:14.128 --> 23:16.830
Napkin.
What's going on?

23:16.864 --> 23:19.833
I think Epyck...

23:19.867 --> 23:21.668
Stole some money from my purse.

23:21.703 --> 23:24.638
No.

23:24.672 --> 23:26.840
I mean, it's only
20 bucks, but...

23:26.874 --> 23:28.308
I'm pretty sure it was her.

23:28.343 --> 23:32.279
[Sighing] Oh, shoot.

23:32.313 --> 23:34.615
I don't see what the big deal is...
You work there.

23:34.649 --> 23:38.318
The big deal is
I'm an adult, and you are not.

23:38.353 --> 23:39.486
I'm basically an adult.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.355
And it's just
a waitressing job.

23:41.389 --> 23:43.390
It's not like I'm dancing
or anything.

23:43.424 --> 23:44.858
That's my point.
Why don't you waitress

23:44.892 --> 23:46.393
at, like, Red Lobster?

23:46.427 --> 23:48.161
Because Red Lobster
doesn't have

23:48.196 --> 23:49.963
a bunch of drunk guys
giving you $100 tips.

23:49.998 --> 23:51.298
You know what?

23:51.332 --> 23:52.799
I don't even really want
to talk about his anymore,

23:52.834 --> 23:57.137
'cause I just don't feel
like it.

23:57.171 --> 23:58.405
Are you okay?

24:06.447 --> 24:08.415
Are you okay?

24:10.451 --> 24:12.219
Don't worry.
I washed it.

24:14.956 --> 24:16.823
You're pregnant?

24:16.858 --> 24:20.494
- Apparently.
- Again?

24:20.528 --> 24:23.563
Were you planning this?
[Scoffs]

24:23.598 --> 24:27.668
Planning it, in the sense
that Billy came home

24:27.702 --> 24:29.936
like a whiny,
horny eighth-grader

24:29.971 --> 24:31.071
and climbed on top of me

24:31.105 --> 24:32.539
and then passed out
on top of me

24:32.573 --> 24:33.974
and smelled like nachos
the whole time...

24:34.008 --> 24:36.510
That kind of planning it.

24:36.544 --> 24:38.478
Still, this is exciting.

24:38.513 --> 24:42.182
You're gonna have
another little Stevie.

24:42.216 --> 24:44.051
You're happy, right?

24:48.656 --> 24:49.690
I didn't steal the money.

24:49.724 --> 24:51.191
I think you did.

24:51.225 --> 24:52.592
Well, I didn't, lady,
all right?

24:52.627 --> 24:53.694
Epyck...Respect.

24:53.728 --> 24:55.028
She doesn't respect me.

24:55.063 --> 24:57.764
[Scoffs]

24:57.799 --> 24:59.299
So who else do you think
might have done it?

24:59.334 --> 25:00.667
Well, what about Nicky
or Maury D?

25:00.702 --> 25:01.768
- They were there too.
- No. Uh-uh.

25:01.803 --> 25:03.270
I was with them the whole time.

25:03.304 --> 25:04.571
Well, I didn't steal
the money, okay?

25:04.605 --> 25:05.772
I don't even care
if you don't believe me,

25:05.807 --> 25:07.407
- 'cause it's the truth.
- Okay.

25:07.442 --> 25:08.875
So I'm gonna just look
in your bag.

25:08.910 --> 25:10.277
No, no.
This is ridiculous.

25:10.311 --> 25:11.778
This is ridiculous!
Stop it!

25:11.813 --> 25:13.580
Hey! Hey! Hey!

25:13.614 --> 25:16.316
- Get off of me!
- Aah!

25:16.351 --> 25:17.818
Oh...

25:17.852 --> 25:22.389
Oh, my God.
Sit down. Sit down!

25:22.423 --> 25:26.326
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

25:26.361 --> 25:28.795
Mrs. Taylor, I'm sorry.

25:28.830 --> 25:31.331
Okay.

25:35.002 --> 25:36.269
Hey, mom.

25:36.304 --> 25:38.605
Hey, babe.
What are you doing here?

25:38.639 --> 25:40.474
I got benched.

25:40.508 --> 25:43.510
Coach is putting Luke
at quarterback

25:43.544 --> 25:45.479
instead of me Friday night.

25:45.513 --> 25:49.015
Is this because
you missed that practice?

25:49.050 --> 25:51.785
- That's what started it.
- Mm-hmm.

25:51.819 --> 25:54.788
I thought your father said
everything was gonna work out.

25:54.822 --> 25:56.123
He did.

25:56.157 --> 25:58.458
He thinks coach
is just bluffing.

25:58.493 --> 26:00.327
And what do you think?

26:00.361 --> 26:02.696
Hmm?

26:02.730 --> 26:05.599
Okay, look, come over here.
Come on.

26:05.633 --> 26:08.001
You... you know your father
loves you, right?

26:08.035 --> 26:09.469
Yeah, but...

26:09.504 --> 26:11.138
Okay? And he just wants
the best for you.

26:11.172 --> 26:12.672
And I know sometimes
he gets really excited,

26:12.707 --> 26:14.474
and he just doesn't know
what to do with himself.

26:14.509 --> 26:17.144
But you know what?
He thinks you're a star.

26:17.178 --> 26:18.612
He tells me that all the time.

26:18.646 --> 26:20.680
I know.

26:23.284 --> 26:24.985
So...

26:25.019 --> 26:27.154
But I-I think
you need to, um,

26:27.188 --> 26:31.191
maybe not take his advice
all the time.

26:31.225 --> 26:33.226
Yeah.

26:33.261 --> 26:37.397
I mean, you have a good head
on your shoulders... use it.

26:37.432 --> 26:39.132
You know what to do.

26:39.167 --> 26:41.601
Okay?

26:41.636 --> 26:44.004
Yes, ma'am.

26:46.240 --> 26:47.574
Okay, just let me look.

26:47.608 --> 26:49.209
- I'm fine.
- Just look straight.

26:49.243 --> 26:50.444
Just hold your head still.

26:50.478 --> 26:53.513
I need to see if you might have
a concussion.

26:53.548 --> 26:54.781
It's about time you showed up.

26:54.816 --> 26:56.516
Where's security
when we need them?

26:56.551 --> 26:57.784
- What happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

26:57.819 --> 26:59.453
This little psycho
pushed your wife

26:59.487 --> 27:01.788
halfway across the room.
What?

27:01.823 --> 27:03.523
No, it was an acc...
Ow.

27:03.558 --> 27:05.992
- It was an accident?
- Come on in.

27:06.027 --> 27:07.594
Y'all, this is not necessary.

27:07.628 --> 27:10.297
Stand up for me, please.
Turn around.

27:10.331 --> 27:11.631
This is ridiculous.

27:11.666 --> 27:13.300
The board
is setting up counsel.

27:13.334 --> 27:15.302
And they got to talk
to both of you.

27:15.336 --> 27:18.205
This is absurd. I'm sorry.
Y'all, this is not necessary.

27:18.239 --> 27:20.307
- Levi!
- It's out of my hands, Tami.

27:20.341 --> 27:23.977
It was an accident,
for lord's sake.

27:25.313 --> 27:27.247
Levi.

27:47.535 --> 27:50.537
[Jess cries softly]

27:59.547 --> 28:02.215
- Hey.
- Hey, coach.

28:02.250 --> 28:03.884
You okay?

28:03.918 --> 28:06.119
Mm-hmm.

28:11.092 --> 28:12.926
Why are you crying in here?

28:15.863 --> 28:17.264
I'm sorry. Uh...

28:17.298 --> 28:21.501
You don't need
to say you're sorry.

28:21.536 --> 28:26.640
Um, I just think, like,
Vince and I broke up, so...

28:26.674 --> 28:31.044
But it... it won't be
a problem.

28:31.078 --> 28:33.680
I promise I won't make
a big deal, like...

28:33.714 --> 28:35.448
I didn't know anyone
was in here.

28:42.390 --> 28:45.425
You know I got
two daughters, don't you?

28:45.459 --> 28:49.062
Yeah.

28:52.033 --> 28:53.667
You take all the time you need.

29:00.775 --> 29:02.242
You're benching Vince?
Why?

29:02.276 --> 29:04.044
Because, Hastings,
just like in real life,

29:04.078 --> 29:06.479
there are still rules
on this team.

29:06.514 --> 29:09.082
Unlike real life,
nobody's above the rules

29:09.116 --> 29:10.817
on this field.

29:10.851 --> 29:13.153
Break 'em down.

29:13.187 --> 29:14.321
Here we go.
Bring it up.

29:14.355 --> 29:16.823
Bring it in.
Let's go!

29:16.857 --> 29:21.561
Blue 18! Blue 18!
Hut! Hut!

29:23.931 --> 29:26.232
Hut!

29:26.267 --> 29:28.835
Luke, come on!

29:28.869 --> 29:30.370
Take charge of this thing.
Let's go.

29:30.404 --> 29:33.707
Set, hut!

29:33.741 --> 29:37.844
Blue 18! Blue 18!
Set, hut! Hut!

29:37.878 --> 29:40.447
Luke, you got to stay
in there and get the exchange.

29:40.481 --> 29:42.082
Let's go from the line again.
Come on, now.

29:42.116 --> 29:43.683
Get up underneath there.

29:43.718 --> 29:47.387
You understand?
Let's go.

29:47.421 --> 29:48.989
So I went to see
a couple museums today,

29:49.023 --> 29:51.091
and they were pretty amazing.

29:51.125 --> 29:52.459
And then I was gonna go
to the planetarium,

29:52.493 --> 29:53.893
but it was the most
beautiful day outside,

29:53.928 --> 29:55.996
so I decided
I'd just go for a walk.

29:56.030 --> 29:57.263
And then...
Have you seen the bean?

29:57.298 --> 29:58.565
I have seen the bean.

29:58.599 --> 30:00.867
The bean is kind of amazing
up close in person.

30:00.901 --> 30:02.268
Julie, what...
what are you doing?

30:02.303 --> 30:04.704
I'm telling you about my day.

30:04.739 --> 30:06.573
Right, I know, but I mean,

30:06.607 --> 30:07.874
what are you doing here
in Chicago?

30:07.908 --> 30:11.244
Don't you have to go home
at some point?

30:11.278 --> 30:14.948
Well, I thought that you said
that I could stay.

30:14.982 --> 30:16.349
Right.
And you can.

30:16.384 --> 30:18.685
B-but do your parents

30:18.719 --> 30:21.221
even know that you're here?

30:23.391 --> 30:24.958
Look, this has all been great.

30:24.992 --> 30:29.095
This food is amazing.
You're amazing.

30:29.130 --> 30:32.332
I just... I don't want to be
your safety net.

30:36.470 --> 30:38.104
What is that supposed to mean?

30:38.139 --> 30:39.973
I mean that it feels
like you're only here

30:40.007 --> 30:41.608
because you're trying
to avoid some stuff

30:41.642 --> 30:43.243
that's going on
in your real life,

30:43.277 --> 30:45.745
you know, 'cause you're supposed
to be at college.

30:45.780 --> 30:48.448
I am. It's not like I'm
moving in with you or something.

30:48.482 --> 30:50.550
Don't get mad, okay?
Do not get mad at me.

30:50.584 --> 30:53.053
I'm just... I'm just trying
to say to you

30:53.087 --> 30:55.655
you have a life somewhere else

30:55.690 --> 30:56.956
that you need to be living,

30:56.991 --> 31:00.994
and that life is in Burleson.

31:01.028 --> 31:03.263
So this whole week,
you and me...

31:03.297 --> 31:04.931
Has been amazing.
It's been great.

31:04.965 --> 31:07.000
I wish you could stay longer.
I wish you lived here.

31:07.034 --> 31:08.968
But...

31:09.003 --> 31:11.337
But you don't live here.

31:17.678 --> 31:19.412
I got to...

31:19.447 --> 31:22.182
Where you going?

31:22.216 --> 31:23.783
I got to go for a walk.

31:23.818 --> 31:27.620
- Where?
- I just need some air.

31:35.396 --> 31:37.997
You got to be kidding me.
You got to be kidding me!

31:38.032 --> 31:40.300
This is friggin' fantastic!

31:40.334 --> 31:42.235
Hey, Stevie's gonna have
a little brother...

31:42.269 --> 31:43.436
Or a sister.

31:43.471 --> 31:44.938
Yeah, let's just calm down.
