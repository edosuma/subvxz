WEBVTT

00:06.640 --> 00:09.410
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.443 --> 00:12.413
YOU KNOW, ARIEL, WHAT I LIKE BEST
ABOUT CHAMBER-OF-COMMERCE MEETINGS?

00:12.446 --> 00:15.049
COMING BACK HERE AND
DRINKING IT OFF.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.751
ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ME DRUNK
AND HAVE YOUR WAY WITH ME?

00:17.785 --> 00:19.753
HEY, I HAVEN'T GIVEN
UP ON MEN YET.

00:19.787 --> 00:22.690
BUT IF I EVER DO, YOU ARE AT THE
TOP OF MY IF-I-WERE-GAY LIST.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.359
THAT IS SO SWEET.

00:25.393 --> 00:28.529
ALL RIGHT, I'VE GOT MEETINGS WITH
HORRIBLE PEOPLE EARLY TOMORROW MORNING,

00:28.562 --> 00:30.364
SO THIS IS ME GETTING MY COAT.

00:30.398 --> 00:33.567
AND THIS IS ME KEEPING THE
REST OF THE WINE FOR MYSELF.

00:33.601 --> 00:37.105
- BYE.
- SEE YA.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.540
VALERIE, THIS IS NOT
THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

00:39.573 --> 00:42.643
IT IS TO ME. ALL I WANTED YOU
TO DO WAS MEET MY FATHER.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.612
I DON'T THINK I'M
BEING UNREASONABLE.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.448
FIND SOME OTHER BARISTA TO MAKE
YOUR SKINNY VANILLA LATTES.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.283
WE'RE OVER, JOE LONGO.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.719
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT... HEY!

00:51.752 --> 00:54.322
JEEZ, LONGO, WOULD IT HAVE
KILLED YOU TO MEET HER FATHER?

00:54.355 --> 00:56.056
SORT OF. HE DIED TWO YEARS AGO.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.058
SHE BROUGHT HIM OVER IN A JAR.

00:58.092 --> 01:00.094
SHE WANTED ME TO MEET HIS ASHES.

01:00.128 --> 01:02.763
WOW, BIG SURPRISE... ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR LIGHT-WEIGHT LADIES

01:02.796 --> 01:06.334
POPS LIKE A BALLOON AND FLIES
AROUND THE ROOM. PFFT!

01:06.367 --> 01:08.602
IT'S TOO BAD TOO. VALERIE WAS
REALLY SOMETHING SPECIAL.

01:08.636 --> 01:12.673
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO EVER GOT MY
SKINNY VANILLA LATTES EXACTLY RIGHT.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.109
I AM SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

01:15.143 --> 01:17.511
BUT, COME ON, SHE'S NOT THE FIRST
WOMAN TO STORM OUT OF HERE

01:17.545 --> 01:19.680
SAYING, "IT'S OVER, JOE LONGO."

01:19.713 --> 01:21.749
IT IS THE FIRST TIME A
WOMAN STORMED OUT OF HERE

01:21.782 --> 01:23.684
CARRYING A DEAD GUY IN A CAN.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.786
YOU KNOW, NOT THAT
I'M KEEPING TRACK,

01:25.819 --> 01:28.189
BUT SINCE I'VE KNOWN YOU,
YOU'VE DATED NOTHING

01:28.222 --> 01:30.090
BUT THESE INSUBSTANTIAL
FLAKY CRAZIES.

01:30.124 --> 01:32.660
HEY, YOU FORGOT "HOT."

01:32.693 --> 01:36.330
OH, OKAY... HOT AND FLAKY.
YOU'RE DATING PUFF PASTRIES.

01:36.364 --> 01:40.334
YOU KNOW, YOU NEED A WOMAN WHO'S
MORE MATURE, MORE REFINED,

01:40.368 --> 01:42.236
MORE MEATY.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.705
MMM, YEAH, I DO LIKE 'EM MEATY,

01:44.738 --> 01:47.741
LIKE A LADY POT PIE.

01:47.775 --> 01:51.212
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED? YOU NEED A
WOMAN WHO'S GOT GOALS AND A CAREER.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.547
YOU KNOW? SOMEONE WHO'S
STRONG AND INDEPENDENT,

01:53.581 --> 01:55.616
BUT SENSITIVE AND FLIRTATIOUS.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.117
SOMEONE LIKE ME...

01:57.151 --> 02:00.388
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, ONE
THAT CAN STAND YOU.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.790
UNFORTUNATELY, WOMEN LIKE
THAT DON'T JUST FLY AROUND

02:02.823 --> 02:04.825
LIKE MARY POPPINS
ON HER UMBRELLA.

02:04.858 --> 02:08.296
SORRY, FORGOT MY UMBRELLA.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.866
NOOO.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.737
- ♪ IT'S ALL GOOD
- ♪ ALL GOOD

02:16.770 --> 02:18.406

02:34.888 --> 02:37.625
SORRY TO BARGE IN, BUT THIS IS THE FIFTH
ONE OF THESE I'VE BOUGHT IN A MONTH.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.494
I'M SINGLE-HANDEDLY SUPPORTING
THE UMBRELLA INDUSTRY OF TOLEDO.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.730
( laughs )

02:42.763 --> 02:46.834
OKAY, THIS IS ARIEL, MY FRIEND
FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,

02:46.867 --> 02:50.170
AND THIS IS JOE,
MY MALE NANNY MAN.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.340
THANK YOU FOR BUTCHING
THAT UP, BURKE.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.342
- HI.
- NICE MEETING YOU, JOE.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.244
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY
THE EXACT SAME THING,

02:56.277 --> 02:58.212
EXCEPT I WAS GOING TO PUT
YOUR NAME IN THE JOE SPOT.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.880
YEAH, THAT'S GREAT. OKAY.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.315
WELL, SEE YOU LATER, ARIEL.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.684
- BYE, JOE.
- BYE.

03:03.717 --> 03:06.654
( sighs )

03:06.687 --> 03:08.489
I AM STARVING.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.824
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ABOUT HER, HUH?

03:10.858 --> 03:12.326
FIX ME UP WITH ARIEL.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.429
UH, "NOOO" MEANS NOOO.

03:15.463 --> 03:18.832
HEY, NOW COME ON, YOU
SAID I NEED SOMEONE

03:18.866 --> 03:22.670
CLASSY AND SMART AND WHO
ACTUALLY BURIES THEIR DEAD.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.805
JOE, PLEASE, ARIEL IS THE GOAL.

03:24.838 --> 03:27.675
WHEN YOU DECIDE TO GO TO THE MOON,
YOU DON'T SEND YOUR BEST GUY FIRST.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.910
YOU START OFF WITH A CHIMP.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.779
SO YOU WANT ME TO DATE A CHIMP?

03:31.812 --> 03:35.783
ARIEL IS A C.E.O. SHE
RUNS HER OWN BUSINESS.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.286
SHE IS THE DREAM. EASE
INTO IT, YOU KNOW?

03:38.319 --> 03:40.288
GET YOUR FEET WET WITH
A NICE PARALEGAL.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.423
AH, I SEE, SO YOU DON'T
THINK I COULD HANDLE

03:42.456 --> 03:44.358
YOUR LITTLE HIGH-POWERED
BLAZER LADY FRIEND.

03:44.392 --> 03:49.363
PERSONALLY, I THINK YOU'D BE
STRETCHING IT WITH THE CHIMP.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.865
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU NEED?
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING?

03:51.899 --> 03:54.802
AM I TALKING TOO MUCH? IS
THIS TOO MANY QUESTIONS?

03:54.835 --> 03:58.539
I'LL BE OKAY. ( sighs )

03:58.572 --> 04:01.275
WHAT'S WITH HER, HASKELL?
DID SOMETHING BAD HAPPEN?

04:01.309 --> 04:03.611
YEAH, THE WORST
THING IMAGINABLE.

04:03.644 --> 04:07.247
- THEY KICKED HER OFF THE SCHOOL BLOG.
- OH, THAT'S IT?

04:07.281 --> 04:09.983
I MEAN, YES, OF COURSE, THAT
IS THE WORST THING IMAGINABLE.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.985
I TRANSFORMED THAT BLOG.

04:12.019 --> 04:15.323
I GOT RID OF STUPID ARTICLES LIKE
"WHAT IF 'TWILIGHT' WAS REAL?"

04:15.356 --> 04:17.691
I MADE IT SIGNIFICANT.
I MADE IT MATTER.

04:17.725 --> 04:18.826
WHO'D YOU PISS OFF THIS TIME?

04:18.859 --> 04:20.528
SHE CALLED HER GYM TEACHER

04:20.561 --> 04:22.996
THE KIM JONG IL OF
PHYSICAL EDUCATION.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.865
- OOH!
- IT NEEDED TO BE SAID.

04:24.898 --> 04:28.469
SHE'S MEAN AND THEY
HAVE THE SAME HAIRCUT.

04:28.502 --> 04:31.305
MAYBE IT DIDN'T NEED
TO BE WRITTEN DOWN.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.273
I'VE BEEN TELLING HER, SHE
SHOULD START HER OWN BLOG.

04:33.307 --> 04:34.942
SHE DOESN'T LISTEN
TO OTHER PEOPLE.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.345
( gasps ) I JUST HAD
THE GREATEST IDEA.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.547
I'M GONNA START MY OWN BLOG.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.650
GOOD IDEA. I LOVE
HEARING YOU THINK.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.952
DO YOU KNOW HOW LUCKY I AM?

04:44.985 --> 04:48.389
I FORGET... HOW LONG
HAVE THEY BEEN MARRIED?

04:48.422 --> 04:50.491
THEY TOTALLY GET EACH OTHER.
IT'S SICKENING.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.960
I KNOW. SPEAKING OF GREAT COUPLES,
YOU GONNA HOOK ME UP WITH ARIEL?

04:52.993 --> 04:55.629
FINE, I'LL CALL HER FOR YOU.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.965
BUT, YOU KNOW, I PREDICT THIS WHOLE
THING'S GOING TO BLOW UP IN YOUR FACE.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.833
I MEAN, SHE MAY NOT EVEN
BE INTERESTED IN YOU.

04:59.867 --> 05:03.904
ARE YOU KIDDING? SHE... SAW ME.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.977
Man's voice: To
make a knit stitch,

05:10.010 --> 05:12.480
hold the needle you've cast
onto in your left hand.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.915
- GOT IT.
- Hold the yarn in your right hand.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.385
- GOT IT.
- Insert the tip of the right needle

05:17.418 --> 05:19.487
- into the first stitch of...
- WAIT, MY RIGHT OR YOUR RIGHT?

05:19.520 --> 05:21.321
WAIT, WHOA, SLOW DOWN. HOLD ON.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.990
- The right needle under...
- WAIT, SLOW DOWN!

05:23.023 --> 05:25.058
PAUSE. DAMN IT, PAUSE!

05:25.092 --> 05:27.995
See? So simple anyone can do it.

05:28.028 --> 05:31.599
OH, SCREW THIS. I'M GETTING
MYSELF A GLASS OF WINE.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.404
HEY, THERE. WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

05:36.437 --> 05:39.373
KNITTING, DAMN IT.
IT'S RELAXING.

05:39.407 --> 05:42.976
NICE. I JUST GOT BACK FROM
MY FIRST DATE WITH ARIEL.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.513
YOU KNOW, THE ONE THAT YOU
SAID WAS GOING TO BLOW UP?

05:45.546 --> 05:47.881
AND YOU WERE RIGHT,
IT DID BLOW UP...

05:47.915 --> 05:50.050
LIKE THE FOURTH OF
FRIGGIN' JULY, BABY!

05:50.083 --> 05:53.421
SHE LIKED YOU? I'M SORRY, I
DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY IT THAT WAY.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.088
BUT SHE LIKED YOU?

05:55.122 --> 05:56.924
YEAH, WE GOT ALONG GREAT.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.627
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT, IT WAS
ACTUALLY VERY REFRESHING

05:59.660 --> 06:01.995
TO GO OUT WITH A WOMAN WHO
IS MY INTELLECTUAL PEER...

06:02.029 --> 06:03.664
BASICALLY.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.065
SO THANK YOU.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.867
THAT'S IT?

06:06.900 --> 06:09.803
THANK YOU? WHAT'S THE TWIST?
WHERE'S THE ZINGER?

06:09.837 --> 06:11.371
THERE'S NO TWIST.
THERE'S NO ZINGER.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.373
OH, AND TONIGHT WHEN
WE WERE AT DINNER,

06:13.407 --> 06:15.375
I RAN INTO AN OLD FRIEND OF
MINE FROM BUSINESS SCHOOL

06:15.409 --> 06:18.011
WHO IS NOW IN FACT SINGLE AND I
THINK WOULD BE PERFECT FOR YOU.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.847
PERFECT FOR WHAT?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.615
PERFECT FOR YOU TO GO OUT WITH.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.784
ALL RIGHT? THIS IS MY
WAY OF SAYING THANKS.

06:23.817 --> 06:28.489
CONSIDER THIS FRIEND OF MINE A
MUFFIN BASKET OF MAN FOR YOU.

06:28.522 --> 06:31.892
JOE, I DON'T THINK I'D BE
INTERESTED IN ANY FRIEND OF YOURS.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.094
AND THEREIN LIES THE PROBLEM.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.497
YOU HOLD ALL MEN UP TO
AN IMPOSSIBLE IDEAL.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.832
I COULD WALK GEORGE CLOONEY IN HERE
AND YOU'D FIND FAULT WITH HIM.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.001
UH, CLOONEY DOES SEEM
PRETTY SELF-INVOLVED.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.070
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
- I AM NOT A FAULT-FINDER.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.539
YOU ARE THE DRUG-SNIFFING
DOG OF FINDING FAULT.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.875
YOU BROKE UP WITH THAT ONE GUY
BECAUSE HE WAS TOO HANDSOME.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.010
I DON'T LIKE TO DATE
ANYONE PRETTIER THAN ME.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.813
WELL, THAT... ALL
RIGHT, I GET THAT.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.082
WHAT ABOUT THAT DOCTOR THAT
YOU BROKE UP WITH, HUH?

06:55.115 --> 06:57.084
HE COULD NEVER FOCUS
ON ME, YOU KNOW?

06:57.117 --> 06:59.720
HE WAS ALWAYS CHECKING IN TO
SEE IF SOME PRECIOUS KIDNEY

06:59.753 --> 07:03.423
HAD ARRIVED AT THE AIRPORT.
TALK ABOUT SELF-INVOLVED.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.726
AND THAT IS MY POINT. YOU
ALWAYS FIND THE FLAWS.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.461
WELL, I HAVE HIGH STANDARDS.

07:07.495 --> 07:11.098
YEAH, AND ALL THE MITTENS YOU
CAN KNIT ON A SATURDAY NIGHT.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.400
TELL HIM TO CALL ME.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.403
- YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.
- GOOD. JUST MAKE SURE HE'S NOT...

07:16.436 --> 07:18.038
I'M SORRY, WERE YOU
GOING TO SAY SOMETHING?

07:18.071 --> 07:20.207
NOTHING.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.114
HOW'S YOUR BLOG COMING?

07:27.147 --> 07:29.483
I'VE ONLY GOT A FEW
ARTICLES AND HALF A FORMAT.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.485
AND MY SITE STILL
NEEDS A CATCHY NAME.

07:31.519 --> 07:34.421
HOW ABOUT "THE DAILY LENNOX,"

07:34.454 --> 07:36.089
OR "NUGGETS FROM SCANLON"?

07:36.123 --> 07:38.926
I SAID CATCHY, NOT SUCKY.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.563
"CRANKY TEEN GIRL"?
"IT'S ALL ABOUT ME"?

07:42.596 --> 07:46.033
"I'M THE ONLY ONE WITH
PROBLEMS DOT COM"?

07:46.066 --> 07:48.836
EXCUSE ME, I DON'T COMPLAIN.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.672
I EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON. I
EXPLAIN WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW.

07:51.705 --> 07:54.875
HOW ABOUT "YAPPETY YAP YAP"?

07:54.908 --> 07:57.110
- I'M GIVING YOU GOLD. YOU SHOULD BE WRITING THESE DOWN.
- ( knocks )

07:59.146 --> 08:01.715
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT ONE.

08:01.749 --> 08:05.485
SO DID YOU EAT YET, OR YOU WANT
TO GET SOMETHING AT THE MOVIES?

08:05.519 --> 08:08.121
OH GOD, I FORGOT.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.157
BUT I HAVE SO MUCH
TO DO FOR MY BLOG.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.793
I DON'T EVEN HAVE A
NAME FOR IT YET.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.530
GOT IT... "I'M BLONDE AS HELL AND
I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE."

08:17.731 --> 08:20.233
I'M TELLING YOU,
THESE ARE GREAT.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.936
I'M SORRY, HASKELL, BUT
I REALLY HAVE TO WORK.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.038
OH, OKAY. YOU'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.107
YEAH, THAT'S COOL. THAT'S COOL.

08:27.140 --> 08:30.010
I'VE GOT SOME STUFF
TO DO MYSELF.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.712
LATER, BYE.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.218
WOW. LENNOX, OUCH.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.119
WHAT?

08:39.152 --> 08:40.954
HASKELL LOOKED
REALLY UPSET THERE.

08:40.988 --> 08:44.091
WHAT? NO NO. HE HAD THINGS TO DO.
HE SAID HE WAS COOL.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.993
YEAH, WHEN A GUY SAYS IT'S COOL,

08:46.026 --> 08:49.262
IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHEN WE
SAY, "EVERYTHING'S FINE."

08:49.296 --> 08:53.266
OH. OH!

08:53.300 --> 08:56.203
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BLOW HIM
OFF, I'M JUST SO BUSY.

08:56.236 --> 08:59.139
NO ONE HAS ANY IDEA HOW MUCH
WORK THIS BLOG THING IS.

08:59.172 --> 09:02.275
NO, I THINK WE DO, 'CAUSE
YOU KEEP TELLING US.

09:02.309 --> 09:05.212
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU NEED TO MAKE A
LITTLE MORE EFFORT IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

09:05.245 --> 09:08.148
I WANT TO. HASKELL'S
IMPORTANT TO ME.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.150
HOW DO YOU DO IT ALL, AUNT MEL?

09:10.183 --> 09:12.119
YOU CAN'T. YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO GIVE UP SOMETHING.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.922
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME. I HAD TO
SACRIFICE MY 6:00 A.M. WORKOUTS

09:14.955 --> 09:18.659
THAT I LOVED SO MUCH
THAT ONE TIME I WENT.

09:18.692 --> 09:21.294
NO NO, I CAN DO IT ALL.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.997
- I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
- YEAH, YOU'LL BE THE ONE.

09:24.031 --> 09:27.267
( laughs ) HEY, SORRY I'VE
GOT TO RUSH OUT OF HERE.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.569
I'VE GOT A BLIND DATE
THAT JOE SET ME UP WITH.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.271
- YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT?
- SURE.

09:31.304 --> 09:34.274
- EVERYTHING'S FINE.
- COOL.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.214
ALL RIGHT, "TO KNOW
HIM IS TO LOVE HIM."

09:41.248 --> 09:45.986
WRITTEN BY PHIL SPECTOR; RECORDED
BY THE TEDDY BEARS IN 1958.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.188
RIGHT AGAIN. WOW,
OKAY, "EARTH ANGEL."

09:48.221 --> 09:52.826
WILLIAMS AND BELVIN. RELEASED
IN 1955 BY THE PENGUINS.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.562
CORRECT. YOU CANNOT BE STUMPED.

09:55.595 --> 09:59.166
I CAN ALSO RECITE THE U.S. VICE
PRESIDENTS IN REVERSE ORDER.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.935
IT IS A FREAKISH, USELESS GIFT.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.004
I CAN FIT MY WHOLE
FIST IN MY MOUTH,

10:04.037 --> 10:06.206
ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T REALLY
IMPRESS THE BOYFRIENDS' PARENTS.

10:06.239 --> 10:08.308
I LEARNED THAT THE HARD WAY.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.210
WANT SOME MORE
CHEESY GARLIC FRIES?

10:10.243 --> 10:13.046
THAT MIGHT BE THE HOTTEST THING
A MAN HAS EVER SAID TO ME.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.349
EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND. I JUST
GOTTA CHECK IN ON THE KIDS.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.786
I MEAN, NOT MY KIDS, OF COURSE.
MY SISTER'S KIDS.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.221
YOUR MUCH MUCH OLDER
SISTER, RIGHT?

10:21.254 --> 10:23.090
I MEAN, YOU'RE WAY TOO
YOUNG TO HAVE KIDS.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.725
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY A
TEENAGER YOURSELF.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.894
OH, YOU ARE SCORING ALL
KINDS OF POINTS TONIGHT.

10:26.927 --> 10:30.130
BUT TECHNICALLY, I
AM LEGAL, SO...

10:32.399 --> 10:34.868
UH, HI, JOE'S VOICEMAIL.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.671
YOU SAID YOU WANTED A MID-DATE
REPORT, SO HERE IT IS:

10:37.705 --> 10:40.640
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO ADMIT,
THINGS ARE GOING REALLY GREAT.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.710
YOUR FRIEND CLARK,
HE'S TERRIFIC.

10:42.743 --> 10:45.178
SO THANK YOU. STRAIGHT
UP, NO TWIST.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.916
MISS ME?

10:48.949 --> 10:51.952
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR. STICK
YOUR FIST IN YOUR MOUTH.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.687
OH OH, NOT ON A FIRST DATE.

10:53.721 --> 10:56.356
ALL RIGHT, "STAND BY ME."

10:56.389 --> 10:58.759
DENISE GARCIA.

10:58.792 --> 11:02.362
I DON'T KNOW THAT VERSION, BUT
THE ORIGINAL WAS THE DRIFTERS.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.331
( sobbing )

11:04.364 --> 11:08.401
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT ONE WRONG.
IT'S OKAY.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.370
HAVE A GARLIC FRY.

11:10.403 --> 11:13.673
NO, DENISE GARCIA IS MY EX-WIFE.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.208
THAT WAS OUR SONG.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.910
SORRY.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.346
I'M A LITTLE RAW
FROM THE DIVORCE.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.850
YEAH, IT MUST BE HARD TO START
DATING SO SOON AFTER A BREAKUP.

11:22.883 --> 11:27.354
DENISE LEFT ME 89 WEEKS AGO.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.957
UH, LET IT ALL OUT.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.425
AND THERE'S THE TWIST.

11:32.459 --> 11:35.729
CHUBBY CHECKER, 1959!

11:46.273 --> 11:47.407
- WELCOME BACK.
- AH!

11:47.440 --> 11:49.376
- YOU SCARED ME.
- I LIVE HERE.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.978
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT'S SCARY.

11:51.011 --> 11:54.047
SO I GOT YOUR VOICEMAIL.

11:54.081 --> 11:57.017
YOU HAD A GOOD DATE, HUH?
YOU LIKE CLARK, RIGHT?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.419
- MM-HMM.
- OH, JEEZ, THE TIGHT LIPS.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.354
GET READY FOR IT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.956
WHAT IS IT? SHE FOUND A FLAW.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.792
IS HE TOO TALL? IS HE TOO SHORT?

12:04.825 --> 12:08.161
WAS HIS HEART BEATING AT
AN UNACCEPTABLE RATE?

12:08.195 --> 12:10.363
UH, HE CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT HIS EX-WIFE.

12:10.397 --> 12:14.467
LOOK AT THAT... YOU JUST PICK AND
PICK AND PICK UNTIL YOU FIND A FLAW.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.403
BELIEVE ME, I DIDN'T HAVE
TO PICK AT ANYTHING.

12:16.436 --> 12:20.007
IT WAS RIGHT THERE ON THE SURFACE
LIKE A BIG OPEN WEEPING SORE,

12:20.040 --> 12:22.342
AND I MEAN WEEPING.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.177
HE'S IN TOUCH WITH HIS FEELINGS.

12:24.211 --> 12:27.380
HEY, DID YOU EVER CONSIDER THAT
MAYBE YOU'RE THE COMMON DENOMINATOR

12:27.414 --> 12:30.483
IN ALL OF YOUR DATING TRAIN WRECKS?
MAYBE THE PROBLEM IS YOU.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.485
OH, I'M THE PROBLEM? PEOPLE
DON'T WANT TO GO OUT WITH ME?

12:32.519 --> 12:35.355
- THOSE ARE YOUR WORDS.
- ( cell phone beeping )

12:35.388 --> 12:37.357
AHA! IT'S FROM CLARK.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.293
WHAT DO YOU KNOW? HE WANTS
TO GO OUT WITH ME AGAIN.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.929
HE DOESN'T THINK
I'M THE PROBLEM.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.331
HE CALLED ME DENISE IN THE TEXT.

12:44.364 --> 12:47.234
I'M SURE THAT'S JUST A TYPO...
MEL, DENISE.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.902
OH, BOY.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.171
WAIT A MINUTE. DON'T GIVE
UP ON CLARK JUST YET.

12:51.204 --> 12:54.174
HE'S A GOOD GUY, ALL RIGHT? A BLIND
DATE IS A VERY STRESSFUL SITUATION.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.276
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT... I'M GOING
TO DO YOU A FAVOR, ALL RIGHT?

12:56.309 --> 12:57.477
LET'S DO A DOUBLE DATE.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.480
SOMETIMES BEING IN A GROUP TAKES
A LOT OF THE PRESSURE OFF.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.082
DOUBLE DATE, REALLY?

13:02.115 --> 13:04.284
WHAT IS THIS, "HIGH
SCHOOL MUSICAL"?

13:04.317 --> 13:06.386
MY IDEA IS FLAWED?
IT HAS A FAULT?

13:06.419 --> 13:08.455
OKAY, FINE, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE
ALL GOING TO GO OUT TOGETHER

13:08.488 --> 13:09.857
AND I'M SURE IT'LL BE FLAWLESS.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.358
MAYBE TONE DOWN THE
SARCASM JUST A BIT.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.493
YEAH, THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

13:13.526 --> 13:16.163
WOW, IT'S LIKE A
DISEASE WITH ME.

13:19.867 --> 13:23.203
( music playing on TV )

13:27.107 --> 13:29.843
OH! NEED MY HAND.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.780
IT'S A NOTE FOR THE
DRAMA-CLUB STORY.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.182
LAST INTERRUPTION, I PROMISE.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.050
- WE CAN TURN THIS OFF.
- NO NO NO!

13:37.084 --> 13:40.187
THIS IS GOOD. I CAN WRITE
AND DATE AND DO IT ALL.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.322
( cell phone ringing )

13:42.355 --> 13:45.092
OH, THIS IS THE TEACHER
THAT GOT FIRED

13:45.125 --> 13:46.559
THAT I WANTED TO INTERVIEW.

13:46.593 --> 13:50.063
YOU KNOW WHAT? GO AHEAD. WE'LL
WATCH THE MOVIE ANOTHER NIGHT.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.798
IT'S COOL.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.968
NO, COOL? NO, NOT COOL. STAY.

13:55.002 --> 13:58.138
PLEASE STAY. HEY,
MISS CUNNINGHAM.

13:58.171 --> 14:01.208
NO, I'M NOT IN THE
MIDDLE OF ANYTHING.

14:01.241 --> 14:04.811
YOU'RE SUPER IMPORTANT TO ME.
NOW SIT DOWN ON THE COUCH.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.114
WHAT? REALLY?

14:07.147 --> 14:10.250
CAN I QUOTE YOU ON THAT?

14:10.283 --> 14:13.987
I'LL READ ABOUT IT ON THE BLOG.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.266
THAT'S NOT ON THE MENU.

14:26.299 --> 14:29.036
- MAYBE LATER.
- I'M HOPING SO.

14:30.603 --> 14:34.574
HEY, CLARK, HOW ABOUT WE HIT THE
DANCE FLOOR? SHAKE OUR GROOVE THING?

14:34.607 --> 14:37.077
DENISE HAD A GROOVE THING.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.848
AHEM, THANKS, YOU KNOW?

14:41.881 --> 14:44.584
THIS WHOLE DOUBLE-DATE THING
REALLY TOOK HIS MIND OFF HIS EX.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.319
I WISH I WAS KNITTING RIGHT NOW.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.321
THEN I'D HAVE SOME NEEDLES
I COULD POKE IN MY EYES.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.157
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
THE OTHER PERSON, BURKE.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.125
ALL RIGHT? IT'S ALSO ABOUT WHAT YOU
BRING OUT IN THE OTHER PERSON.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.893
THAT'S THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.462
SEE, I BRING OUT
THE BEST IN WOMEN.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.431
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU BRING OUT IN ME?
THIS LINE RIGHT HERE.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.433
HEY, YOU WANT A MARGARITA?

15:00.467 --> 15:03.436
MARGARITA? THAT WAS
DENISE'S MIDDLE NAME.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.638
YEAH? WELL, IT'S MY
MIDDLE NAME TOO.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.640
WAITER?

15:07.674 --> 15:10.910
OOH, COME ON, WE HAVE TO DANCE.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.146
YEAH, DANCING ISN'T
REALLY MY THING.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.514
THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU
NEVER DANCED WITH ME.

15:14.547 --> 15:17.184
I'M SURE YOU'RE GOOD, BUT NO.

15:17.217 --> 15:21.388
LITTLE KNOWN FACT... DANCING WITH
ME HAS MADE BLIND PEOPLE SEE.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.091
OKAY, ONE DANCE.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.392
THERE WE GO! THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.227
COME ON NOW. COME
ON, HERE WE GO.

15:27.260 --> 15:31.098
I'M SORRY, MEL. THIS MUST BE THE
WORST DATE YOU'VE EVER BEEN ON.

15:31.131 --> 15:34.101
NOT THE WORST. YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
COME BACK FROM THE BATHROOM

15:34.134 --> 15:36.136
TO FIND YOU WEARING
MY BRA AND PANTIES.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.071
THE NIGHT IS YOUNG.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.207
SEE? YOU'RE FUN.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.342
I WANT TO BRING THAT
OUT IN YOU, CLARK.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.943
YOU'RE SO SWEET

15:43.977 --> 15:45.678
AND FORGIVING AND UNCRITICAL.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.714
I KNOW? RIGHT?

15:49.282 --> 15:50.917
HEY, HASKELL.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.120
EVERYBODY AT SCHOOL SAID
I SHOULD READ YOUR BLOG,

15:53.153 --> 15:54.988
SO I CHECKED IT OUT.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.458
I WORKED REALLY HARD ON THAT.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.460
SO THIS HASKELL YOU'RE
APOLOGIZING TO,

16:00.493 --> 16:02.429
THAT'S... THAT'S ME, RIGHT?

16:02.462 --> 16:05.598
IT IS. I JUST FEEL AWFUL.
NO MORE DISTRACTED DATING.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.234
I WON'T DO THAT TO
YOU EVER AGAIN.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.536
OH, YOU WILL. AND THAT'S WHY
I BROUGHT OVER MY STUFF.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.972
WE'RE GONNA SIT HERE AND DO
OUR OWN SEPARATE THINGS...

16:13.006 --> 16:14.507
TOGETHER.

16:14.541 --> 16:18.678
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE COULD STOP EVERY
20 MINUTES AND TAKE MAKE-OUT BREAKS.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.447
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.
'CAUSE I'VE HEARD

16:20.480 --> 16:22.549
FREQUENT BREAKS FROM THE
COMPUTER PREVENT EYE STRAIN

16:22.582 --> 16:24.551
AND OTHER KINDS OF STRAIN.

16:24.584 --> 16:28.388
OH, YEAH. IN FACT, IT'S GOOD TO
START WITH A BREAK RIGHT AWAY.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.958
HEY, I GOT IT! THE
NAME FOR YOUR BLOG.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.393
GIVE UP ALREADY.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.228
"LENNOX EXPLAINS IT ALL."

16:35.262 --> 16:37.697
THAT'S... REALLY GOOD.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.399
- YEAH.
- TOTALLY ORIGINAL.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.234
- IT'D BE GREAT, HUH?
- YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

16:41.268 --> 16:42.402
NOW GET OUT.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.737
WHERE WERE WE?

16:44.771 --> 16:46.339
OH YEAH, EYE BREAK.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.755
I WAS SO EMBARRASSED
AFTER THAT FIRST DATE.

17:02.789 --> 17:05.092
I BARELY HAD THE COURAGE
TO ASK YOU OUT AGAIN,

17:05.125 --> 17:08.195
SO I TEXTED REAL FAST
BEFORE I LOST MY NERVE.

17:08.228 --> 17:11.331
YEAH, WELL, I'M GLAD YOU DID. YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.665
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:12.699 --> 17:16.303
SO I AM GOING TO GIVE
THIS TOMATILLO SAUCE

17:16.336 --> 17:18.171
ONE MORE SHOT.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.639
AH, TOO HOT, TOO HOT, TOO HOT.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.742
YEAH, YOU KNOW, THAT EXTRA
MILD WILL GET YOU EVERY TIME.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.145
( slow music playing )

17:25.178 --> 17:28.481
HEY, YOU WANT TO DANCE?

17:28.515 --> 17:30.383
REALLY? YOU SURE?

17:30.417 --> 17:31.718
YEAH.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.187
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
- I WANT TO.

17:37.490 --> 17:40.360
OOH, THIS IS THE RUMBA. COME ON,
WE HAVE TO DANCE TO THIS ONE.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.462
I NEED TO SIT DOWN.
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME.

17:42.495 --> 17:45.298
- NO NO NO, JUST ONE MORE. ONE MORE.
- I DID IT ONCE, OKAY?

17:45.332 --> 17:47.334
LOOK, I DIDN'T EVEN WANT
TO COME HERE TONIGHT.

17:47.367 --> 17:50.803
I KNOW, I KNOW. BUT SEEING AS WE
DID EVERYTHING YOU WANTED TO DO

17:50.837 --> 17:52.639
ON ALL OF OUR OTHER DATES,
I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR

17:52.672 --> 17:56.409
THAT YOU DO WHAT I WANT TO DO
TONIGHT, GIVE MY CHOICE A TRY.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.811
WELL, I TRIED IT AND
I DIDN'T LIKE IT.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.813
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

18:00.847 --> 18:04.217
I SAW YOU SMILING OUT THERE.
I THINK YOU LIKED IT.

18:05.385 --> 18:08.155
JOE, I WAS SMILING TO BE POLITE.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.357
NOTICE I AM NO LONGER SMILING.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.292
I'M GONNA GO HOME NOW.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.461
- WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE, DON'T...
- IT'S OVER, JOE LONGO.

18:16.363 --> 18:17.397
ARIEL?

18:20.600 --> 18:23.403
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.672
- MEL?
- YEAH?

18:25.705 --> 18:28.608
- HOLDING YOU CLOSE LIKE THIS...
- YES, CLARK?

18:28.641 --> 18:31.444
- ...AND LOOKING INTO YOUR EYES...
- I THINK I FEEL IT TOO.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.713
...I MISS MY WIFE SO MUCH.

18:33.746 --> 18:36.183
YOUR EX-WIFE, CLARK.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.484
NO, MAYBE NOT. YOU
SAID YOURSELF,

18:37.517 --> 18:39.186
EVERYONE DESERVES
A SECOND CHANCE.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.254
WELL, YEAH, I SAID IT.
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

18:41.288 --> 18:44.424
I'M GONNA GO YELL OUTSIDE HER
APARTMENT WINDOW RIGHT NOW.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.393
SCREW THAT RESTRAINING ORDER!

18:46.426 --> 18:50.430
I'M THROWING MYSELF ON THE
MERCY OF THE LOVE COURT!

18:52.399 --> 18:54.867
WOW, GUY'S GOT A
REAL PROBLEM, HUH?

18:54.901 --> 18:56.869
- ( laughing )
- YEAH, YOU THINK?

18:56.903 --> 18:58.771
SO WHERE'S ARIEL?

18:58.805 --> 19:02.309
OH, SHE HAD TO LEAVE. SHE HAD AN...
AN EMERGENCY.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.610
WHAT KIND OF EMERGENCY?

19:03.643 --> 19:08.348
THE... THE NOT-LIKING-ME KIND.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.817
AH, GREAT. SO BOTH OUR
DATES CRAPPED OUT

19:10.850 --> 19:12.885
AND THIS NIGHT'S GOING
TO END AT 8:17.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.554
WELL, I'M NOT GOING HOME NOW.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.389
YEAH, THAT'D BE PATHETIC.

19:16.423 --> 19:20.193
SO SHOULD WE, LIKE, DANCE?

19:20.227 --> 19:23.430
WHY THE HELL NOT?

19:31.438 --> 19:33.172
YOU KNOW, JOE, I DON'T GET IT.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.408
WE WERE BOTH FIXED UP
BY REALL SMART PEOPLE.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.410
EXPERTS WHO DID
EVERYTHING EXACTLY RIGHT.

19:37.444 --> 19:40.913
YEAH, BUT I JUST SEEMED TO
BRING OUT THE CRAZY IN CLARK.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.449
WELL, YOU DO HAVE A GIFT.

19:44.451 --> 19:47.487
YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE FINDING-THE-RIGHT-PERSON
THING IS REALLY HARD.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.389
IT IS, IT IS.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.524
BUT YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY YOU
JUST HAVE TO KEEP TRYING.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.526
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE SOMEWHERE
OUT THERE IS A MAN

19:53.560 --> 19:56.162
WITH A VERY HIGH
LEVEL OF TOLERANCE

19:56.195 --> 19:59.599
WHO WILL ONE DAY COME INTO YOUR
LIFE AND SWEEP YOU OFF YOUR FEET...

20:01.301 --> 20:02.735
FLAWLESSLY.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.938

SOMEWHERE OUT THERE

20:08.475 --> 20:10.577

20:20.753 --> 20:22.755
THAT'S NOT LEADING. THAT'S SHOVING
ME AROUND THE DANCE FLOOR.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.624
THE MAN LEADS, THE WOMAN FOLLOWS.
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS

20:24.657 --> 20:26.659

- OKAY, JUST SHUT UP AND DANCE.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.474
