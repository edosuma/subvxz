you should do the talking.

Hi, baby. How's your arm, Momo?

asked you out on a date?

Okay, well, he's not an
asshole, first of all. Yeah.

06:53.188 --> 06:59.287
And he didn't know that I was married,
so, yeah. He asked me out on a date.

07:00.021 --> 07:02.121
Okay. I'll deal with it.

07:02.154 --> 07:04.421
You gonna hang
out with him? Be nice?

07:04.455 --> 07:07.821
I have to do that?
You need to try to make friends here.

07:07.854 --> 07:10.287
I have friends here.
Where?

07:10.320 --> 07:12.254
I have so many friends at work.

07:12.287 --> 07:15.287
You hate those people.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.854
Yeah.

07:17.887 --> 07:19.787
But you talk shit
about them every night.

07:58.487 --> 08:00.887
I've been tossing
some feature ideas around.

08:00.921 --> 08:03.154
You remember that murder
on 7th and Ward last week?

08:03.187 --> 08:07.387
With the mother and child got caught in the
gang cross fire and only the mother survived.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.854
Yeah. I already gave that
to Lyle.

08:09.887 --> 08:12.854
He's gonna approach it like it's a miracle
the mother lived, blah, blah, blah.

08:12.887 --> 08:15.520
Now she's gotta learn how to live in
a world where there's no son around.

08:15.554 --> 08:18.854
That kind of stuff. Okay. I can see
the irony that he's going for there,

08:18.887 --> 08:20.520
but I was gonna take
a different tack.

08:20.554 --> 08:22.387
Which is to try to stick
to the facts

08:22.420 --> 08:25.054
and report some of the pertinent
information to the community.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.854
For example, paramedics took
20 minutes to get there.

08:27.887 --> 08:31.988
What part of I already
gave it to Lyle didn't you get?

08:32.020 --> 08:36.087
Just the part about Lyle being
a dipshit and a terrible writer.

08:37.087 --> 08:39.220
It's Friday, Teague.
It's Friday.

08:39.254 --> 08:42.453
I've been tired of
you since Wednesday. You know?

Bradshaw's been in there every week.

Oh, Dang-o-Lang.

as the last one?

a My Bloody Valentine phase.

10:15.587 --> 10:18.086
You're never gonna let me live it down.
No, I won't.

10:18.119 --> 10:20.853
I'm almost done with
your Zeppelin compilation.

10:20.886 --> 10:23.052
Oh, my God, please,
just save it.

10:24.152 --> 10:28.454
I don't understand. Led Zeppelin is
the greatest rock band of all time.

10:28.487 --> 10:32.520
They are my number one "I don't
get it" band. Favorite band.

10:32.554 --> 10:34.286
"I don't get it."
Favorite band.

I know. I was waiting for the right time.
Good lord.

10:48.554 --> 10:51.987
But then I saw Travis is playing the Saenger
Theatre next week so I got two tickets.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.052
Did you talk to her
at the party last night?

10:55.853 --> 10:57.253
Dane, did you go
to the party last night?

10:57.286 --> 10:59.186
I went to the party
like you told me.

10:59.219 --> 11:01.152
I didn't see her there
and I didn't know anybody,

11:01.186 --> 11:04.253
so I left. I just got
a little...

11:04.286 --> 11:07.186
Well, I think that you
two would be perfect together.

11:07.219 --> 11:09.519
Yeah? Okay. Good, me too.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

11:09.553 --> 11:11.052
Cool.

11:12.119 --> 11:14.219
You don't think
she's too pretty for me...

11:16.553 --> 11:18.986
I really don't
like it when you do that.

11:19.019 --> 11:20.186
Do what?

11:20.219 --> 11:23.886
Cut yourself down like
that and doubt yourself.

Don't do that, Dane.

Hi, Charlotte.

11:40.019 --> 11:43.386
Do you have a minute?
Yeah, of course. What's up?

11:43.419 --> 11:50.253
Um, so, you're like really good friends
with Dane from stage crew, right?

11:50.286 --> 11:54.519
Yeah. Has he ever mentioned
anything to you about me?

11:56.119 --> 12:01.152
[scoffs] Only a couple things here and
there every day for the last three months.

12:01.186 --> 12:05.952
Oh, no. That's what I was
worried about. I'm not into him.

12:05.986 --> 12:08.219
And he is such a nice guy.
Yeah.

12:08.253 --> 12:11.419
I know he likes me because he comes
and he tells me jokes. Mm-hmm.

12:11.453 --> 12:17.286
And, um, I kinda started up this
new thing with Aaron anyway.

12:18.553 --> 12:22.386
That Aaron? Stage manager Aaron?

12:22.419 --> 12:28.852
I know, right? He's totally not my normal
type. But he is really goal driven.

12:28.885 --> 12:31.951
- Great.
- Anyways, so I was just wondering

12:31.985 --> 12:35.553
if maybe you had any advice on
how I could let Dane down easy.

12:35.586 --> 12:39.885
Well, let me just think about it
and then I'll come back to you.

12:39.918 --> 12:41.386
Thanks, Nicole.
Yeah. No problem.

12:41.419 --> 12:43.553

Thank you. You too.

But Nicole mentioned that you write for
the paper and so I... I remembered that.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just
writing features right now,

14:13.185 --> 14:15.385

what I wanna be doing.

14:15.418 --> 14:17.318
What do you want to be doing?

writing for a newspaper,

14:20.018 --> 14:23.418
I wanna write stuff that is...
seems relevant and important

14:23.452 --> 14:26.985

inform someone

or some people who are getting screwed here

like, not the dog show in Shreveport.

14:40.418 --> 14:42.485
Right. I think that's beautiful.

I would then go from there.

like really asking her out over and over...

I'll take them out back, I'll
string 'em up by their nutsacks.

15:45.151 --> 15:48.985
- Thanks, Dane.
- Nah, I'll make sure that they know that she's, uh...

15:49.018 --> 15:51.085
- you know, she's hitched.
- Married.

He's been taking care of Nicole on

Yeah. I'd be tired.
Um, I, uh...

19:20.150 --> 19:21.849

got you something...

I'm gonna open this, okay?

a good step, right?

I figured that we're like over a year now.

I'm sorry I'm late. Traffic was bad.
I left New Orleans at 6:00, I guess.

21:03.083 --> 21:05.482
It's not a problem. Aaron was
able to get off work early.

21:05.515 --> 21:09.782
- Um, Matt called the vet. They said they'd stay open for you.
- Right. Yeah, good idea.

- Yeah. My life's really good.

- Is the smell gone, Dane?

21:40.149 --> 21:42.983
No. No. I will
give you the all clear.

21:43.016 --> 21:45.216
- [Molly] I can still smell it.
- [Evie] Ew!

21:45.250 --> 21:49.882
Okay. I'm just gonna do it.
One, two, three.

21:52.849 --> 21:55.283
Why can't I come with you?

I don't know how long
I'm gonna be in there, Mols.

21:58.549 --> 22:01.849
Is it because my dad's too much of a
chicken to tell us what's going on?

22:01.882 --> 22:05.283
- Maybe.
- She's my dog so I should be there for her.

22:05.316 --> 22:10.216
Well, you're Matt's daughter and so it's
just not really up to me. I'm sorry.

22:11.415 --> 22:13.848
Have you met
Santa's elves before?

22:13.881 --> 22:16.549
Evie, that's a great question.
Thank you.

22:16.582 --> 22:19.183
- Yeah, I met Santa's elves once.
- [Evie] When?

22:19.216 --> 22:23.250
Once. I met them at
at a tiki bar in New Orleans.

22:23.283 --> 22:27.315
Do you think elves really have pointy ears
or do you think that's just in movies?

22:27.349 --> 22:30.315
These elves had pointy ears
and cigarette breath.

like to come back and hold her?

23:12.549 --> 23:14.382
Uh, you mean while you, uh...

23:14.415 --> 23:18.215
Yeah, you know, most owners like
to be in the room with them.

23:18.848 --> 23:21.182
Okay. I mean, it's not my dog.

23:21.215 --> 23:25.282
Right. But you're the good close
friend of the family. She knows you.

23:25.315 --> 23:32.148
It'd be better than just being with us strangers.
Okay? Well, we're ready when you are.

Too far away from me.

Hi, my girls. Look, you're
like a two-headed monster.

25:10.048 --> 25:12.815
I haven't told
Molly about Gracie.

25:13.414 --> 25:16.780
Okay. Just a head's up.
She's pretty pissed off.

25:16.814 --> 25:19.948
Yup. [groans]

25:21.982 --> 25:25.982
I'm gonna talk to her. I just want to separate
Nicole's cancer from the dog's cancer.

25:26.015 --> 25:29.181
And I haven't really figured out how yet.
Do you know what I mean?

25:29.214 --> 25:30.747
Yeah.

25:33.982 --> 25:37.048
Would it help
if I stayed for a while?

25:38.414 --> 25:42.048
You don't need to do this alone if
you don't want to. I could, uh...

25:42.082 --> 25:46.514
I have some vacation days.
I could come help out.

to the other side of this.

your dad does it?

I guess. He hasn't made
sandwiches in a long time.

making them myself.

a Mom and Dad sandwich.

now on you would call me Grandma Dane.

29:08.547 --> 29:12.313
<i>All right, well, I just wanna make
sure you're taking care of yourself.</i>

29:12.347 --> 29:16.113
<i>I know how you can get,
so I'll let you go,</i>

29:16.146 --> 29:21.846
<i>but waiting for you
and, um, I love you a lot.</i>

29:21.879 --> 29:22.912
I love you too.

29:22.945 --> 29:24.380
<i>Okay. Good night.</i>

29:24.413 --> 29:25.979
Bye.

29:26.547 --> 29:28.146
[video call ends]

29:32.813 --> 29:36.614
[truck engine rumbling]

29:40.878 --> 29:45.380
[Matt] I don't know how. It might mean that
I just have to stay a little bit longer.

29:45.413 --> 29:48.480
I can't... Can I call you back
when I can hear you?

29:49.280 --> 29:51.380
It's hard to explain
a lot of things.

29:51.413 --> 29:54.145
The translator left in the
middle and now they're moving us.

29:54.179 --> 29:56.347
There's kind of
a lot going on and...

29:56.380 --> 29:58.746
Yeah. A lot going on.

29:59.347 --> 30:02.746
Hey, you wanna say hi
to Elizabeth? Hang on.

30:03.413 --> 30:05.112
Hey, hey.

30:05.145 --> 30:07.012
That was Elizabeth.

30:12.979 --> 30:17.145
<i>And then the kids are all making this
really amazing, big, colorful mural</i>

30:17.179 --> 30:19.312
<i>for their teachers to
thank them. It's really sweet.</i>

30:19.347 --> 30:23.112
<i>The Atlantic</i> offered me a job
and I have to go to Libya.

30:24.179 --> 30:27.513
<i>Oh. Um, when?</i>

30:27.547 --> 30:29.312
I leave on the 14th.

30:29.346 --> 30:33.079
<i>You leave on the 14th.
So you accepted it already?</i>

30:33.112 --> 30:36.312
Well, we need the money, don't we?
I didn't think I had a choice.

30:36.346 --> 30:38.179
- <i>God.</i>
- [Molly] <i>I wanna see Dad.</i>

30:38.212 --> 30:39.945
<i>Oh, um, say hi.</i>

30:39.979 --> 30:43.112
Hi, girls. Let me talk to Mom
for a minute, all right?

30:43.145 --> 30:46.279
- <i>Matt... It's okay.</i>
- Let me talk to Mom. Hi.

30:47.878 --> 30:50.779
Why are you so upset about this? I don't
understand. We talked all about it.

30:50.812 --> 30:54.346
We talked about this a hundred times. You wanted
to move to Fairhope to be near your family.

30:54.379 --> 30:56.845
<i>Yeah, but I never, ever wanted
to be a single mother.</i>

30:56.878 --> 30:59.446
- <i>That's not how I imagined my life.</i>
- You're not a single mother.

30:59.479 --> 31:02.412
- <i>And you haven't even told me when...</i>
- I can't give you a timeline.

31:02.446 --> 31:05.878
I can't give you a timeline of every little
thing that's gonna happen. I don't know.

31:07.012 --> 31:10.979
Listen, it's been a really long day. I'm
sorry. Can we just talk about it tomorrow?

31:11.012 --> 31:13.145
- All right. Bye.
- [video call ends]

31:17.145 --> 31:19.246
[Elizabeth]
<i>They took all of our panties.</i>

31:19.279 --> 31:21.379
That must have
been a rough four miles, huh?

31:21.412 --> 31:23.512
[laughs]

31:23.546 --> 31:25.845
You're ridiculous.

31:26.979 --> 31:31.979
Oh, man, she was amazing.
Kelly went to Iraq the next day.

31:32.012 --> 31:33.145
Mm.

31:33.912 --> 31:36.346
Then she died one week later.

31:40.845 --> 31:43.346
Sometimes I don't know why
we do this job.

31:47.479 --> 31:49.246
Uh, fame and fortune.

31:51.945 --> 31:56.279
Or... tea and biscuits.

31:57.546 --> 32:01.079
- [elevator dings]
- [chuckles] Oh, uh, what floor are you?

32:01.112 --> 32:02.212
Six.

32:04.179 --> 32:06.045
[Elizabeth] I'm four.

32:07.312 --> 32:09.145
I'm six.

32:09.579 --> 32:11.179
I'm four.

32:11.212 --> 32:13.145
[elevator humming]

32:13.179 --> 32:15.145
[both chuckle]

32:46.412 --> 32:48.279
It's been a long trip, Matt.

32:50.246 --> 32:51.978
Yeah, I know.

33:02.379 --> 33:04.279
Good night, Elizabeth.

33:07.044 --> 33:08.312
Good night.

33:29.245 --> 33:31.811
[girls giggling]

33:31.844 --> 33:34.811
Oh my word.
[laughs]

33:34.844 --> 33:36.412
[Charlotte]
I mean, is the whole town...

33:36.446 --> 33:38.278
Well, you need
a good welcoming.

33:38.311 --> 33:40.311
Hello, ladies!
Hi.

33:40.346 --> 33:44.446
I want y'all to meet one of
my oldest friends Charlotte.

33:44.479 --> 33:48.446
She's amazing. She just moved her
from Baton Rouge with her husband.

33:48.479 --> 33:51.378
And as you can see, she's a little
bit pregnant. Just a little.

33:51.412 --> 33:55.144
So, let's show her a really good time and
welcome her. I can have one glass of wine.

33:55.178 --> 33:56.211
Alison, oh, my God!

33:56.245 --> 33:57.446
Gale. Yes? Hi.

33:57.479 --> 33:59.278
Yes. So nice to meet you.

33:59.311 --> 34:00.811
I've heard so much about you.

34:00.844 --> 34:02.944
You too, for years.
Yes.

34:02.978 --> 34:07.011
...wet the bed, but like
an unbelievable amount of urine.

34:07.044 --> 34:08.844
That's how she does.
[Charlotte] Okay.

34:08.877 --> 34:11.445
She's like the mayor of Fairhope.
Oh my God.

34:11.478 --> 34:14.378
You know, and she was like, "Oh,
no, you don't need to dress up."

34:14.411 --> 34:17.478
...the whole mattress. I was like,
"We have to buy a whole new house."

34:17.511 --> 34:23.311
Hey, Momo, will you please go watch
your sister? But give me a kiss first.

34:25.411 --> 34:27.178
Thank you, my girl.

34:27.210 --> 34:30.277
Do you know that eight women
think they're your best friends?

34:31.210 --> 34:34.043
Well, you really
are my best friend.

34:34.078 --> 34:35.978
Mm-hmm. I better be.
It's true.

34:36.011 --> 34:37.877
You are.
I have stories.

34:37.911 --> 34:39.511
Oh, dang.
Yeah.

34:39.545 --> 34:42.011
Are you gonna blackmail me?
If I have to.

34:42.043 --> 34:44.311
[laughs] You know,
you got a whole new crew.

34:44.344 --> 34:46.777
- [Nicole] Oh, my God.
- I gotta let them know who's boss.

34:46.811 --> 34:48.511
[Nicole] You're frightening.

34:48.545 --> 34:50.245
[Dane] <i>So I'm here
in Fairhope, Alabama,</i>

34:50.277 --> 34:52.344
<i>visiting my friends
and their kids.</i>

34:52.378 --> 34:54.978
I've been reading to the kids.
It's very interesting.

34:55.011 --> 34:57.511
They see these stories through
like different eyes than we do.

34:57.545 --> 34:59.777
The other day I read, uh,
their daughter Molly

34:59.811 --> 35:03.478
<i>One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish.</i>
You remember that one?

35:03.511 --> 35:06.378
And when I finished, she said,
"That's scary, Dane."

35:06.411 --> 35:08.978
I said, "What's scary about it?
Is it the one fish?

35:09.011 --> 35:12.178
The two fish? The red fish?
The blue fish?

35:12.211 --> 35:15.245
She said, "No.
Your lack of ambition."

35:15.278 --> 35:17.211
Thank you. It's pretty scary
to come up here.

35:17.245 --> 35:19.378
I have a friend who's
been wanting to try standup,

35:19.411 --> 35:22.345
but, uh, he's never done it.
[laughing]

35:22.378 --> 35:23.978
He's a little chicken.

35:25.111 --> 35:28.278
So, being in a rural area
like Fairhope,

35:28.311 --> 35:30.843
it's tough because there's
not good cell phone reception.

35:30.876 --> 35:34.311
- Put your pocket back in.
- Thank you. There's not good cell phone reception,

35:34.345 --> 35:37.810
unlike New Orleans. And I got
a lady back in New Orleans.

35:37.843 --> 35:41.445
And we like to keep the, uh, magic alive
so we like to have a little phone sex,

35:41.478 --> 35:44.511
if you know what I mean.
And the bad service makes it a little hard

35:44.544 --> 35:47.843
because things break up in the
middle of some heated moments.

35:47.876 --> 35:50.378
My girlfriend's not very good
at filling in the blanks.

35:50.411 --> 35:54.943
I mean, we're grown adults. Why would
I want you to, uh, play with my clock?

35:54.977 --> 35:57.843
- [laughing]
- Thank you.

35:58.544 --> 36:04.043
Thank you so much, Fairhope, Alabama!
[cheers]

36:04.078 --> 36:06.810
That's so rude.
That's so rude.

36:06.843 --> 36:11.977
But no, I spend all day with her sometimes. Like
write jokes and whatever. It's pretty cool.

36:12.010 --> 36:14.478
Yeah. Yeah, and meet people.
Nice.

36:14.510 --> 36:18.010
When does Matt get back?
Eleven.

36:19.278 --> 36:25.510
He's home for four days.
And then he goes to Libya.

36:25.544 --> 36:27.910
Whoa, when did that happen?

36:27.943 --> 36:30.743
When did it happen
or when did he tell me?

36:33.278 --> 36:35.743
I feel like I...

36:37.876 --> 36:41.943
married a war correspondent,
not a journalist.

36:41.977 --> 36:43.943
I mean, have you told him that?

36:43.977 --> 36:46.743
Matt hears what
he wants to hear.

36:49.278 --> 36:50.977
[sighs]

36:53.077 --> 36:54.378
How's Colleen?

36:54.411 --> 36:57.743
All right. Um, Colleen
broke up with me last week.

36:58.411 --> 37:00.310
Dane!
I know. She said that

37:00.345 --> 37:03.776
she, um, didn't feel like
our relationship was evolving.

37:04.477 --> 37:09.244
Whatever. She's not stupid.
She's great. She's nice. Eh.

37:09.277 --> 37:13.843
I'm moving on. Um, there's this girl
named Kat that I think I'm gonna ask out.

37:13.876 --> 37:16.876
She's a baker,
which is cool.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.843
- Okay.
- Yeah.

37:21.410 --> 37:25.244
Don't be afraid to give
yourself to somebody, Dane.

37:26.443 --> 37:27.711
Promise me.

37:29.477 --> 37:34.177
It's not fair that I'm the only
woman who knows how special you are.

37:37.544 --> 37:39.977
[Dane] Hey, look who's here.
Hey, girls.

37:40.010 --> 37:42.177
- [Molly] Daddy!
- [Evie] Did you bring me a toy?

37:42.210 --> 37:44.843
Wow. Did you bring me a toy?
[Evie] No.

37:44.876 --> 37:47.843
Oh, well, then forget it.
I got it.

37:47.876 --> 37:52.043
Thanks. How you doing? Aaah!

37:52.843 --> 37:54.943
Yeah?
Yeah. Good.

37:54.977 --> 37:56.843
Is she still mad at me?
Oh, yeah.

37:56.876 --> 37:59.776
Oh, good. Hi, babe.

38:01.344 --> 38:06.509
- Oh, man, that is a sophisticated looking shirt.
- [all laughing]

38:06.543 --> 38:09.376
[Dane] So do we go all in now or do
we save up for the end of the line?

38:09.409 --> 38:12.244
[Nicole] I mean,
maybe leave some for some children, but...

38:12.277 --> 38:15.509
Is there a slice limit? Since you're
monitoring my, you know, plate.

38:15.543 --> 38:18.977
Hey, what are you doing? Get out of there.
Mols, get out of there.

38:19.010 --> 38:22.409
Hey, stay with your sister.
Molly! Watch your sister.

38:22.443 --> 38:24.409
I bet you got
some wild stories, huh?

38:24.443 --> 38:27.310
Hey, one night we'll leave the
wives at home, we'll grab some beers

38:27.344 --> 38:29.910
- and you can tell us some of them.
- Hey, Molly, help your sister!

38:29.943 --> 38:33.843
Yeah, well, I tell Nicole everything pretty
much. But we can hang out sometime...

38:33.876 --> 38:37.843
- Molly, stay with Evie!
- Yeah, right, man. I bet you've had some adventures, huh?

38:37.876 --> 38:41.043
- Shit.
- [Molly] Are you okay? Is it your foot?

38:41.077 --> 38:43.775
- [Evie groans]
- [Molly] Evie...

38:43.809 --> 38:46.842
God. What are you doing?
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

38:46.876 --> 38:50.509
Didn't I tell you to watch your sister?
What's the matter with you?

38:50.543 --> 38:52.376
What happened?
Why don't you listen to me?

38:52.409 --> 38:54.043
It's okay.
Come on, Evie. Get up.

38:54.077 --> 38:56.244
It's not your fault, Mols.
Yeah, it is her fault.

38:56.277 --> 38:58.943
I asked her five damn times to watch
her sister. Matt! Watch your mouth.

38:58.977 --> 39:01.244
What? Seriously?
You've been here for two hours.

39:01.277 --> 39:04.875
You're already acting like this?
Acting like what, Nicole? Acting like what?

39:04.909 --> 39:08.143
It's all right. Come on.

39:09.010 --> 39:11.543
Don't take <i>The Atlantic</i>
assignment, Matt.

39:11.576 --> 39:15.809
Stick around, just be with the girls.
Be with Nicole for a little while.

39:15.842 --> 39:17.775
Nicole has you
doing her bidding now?

39:17.809 --> 39:19.376
She's not having
me doing anything.

39:19.409 --> 39:21.842
Why does she think I'm working so much?
We need the money.

39:21.875 --> 39:26.842
I understand. I really do. I just...
My advice is that you sit this one out.

39:26.875 --> 39:29.976
And you think I should be
taking life advice from you?

39:30.875 --> 39:32.942
Yeah. Yeah, actually I do.

39:32.976 --> 39:35.210
And what qualifies you for that?

39:36.277 --> 39:41.143
I'm your best friend, asshole. I'm allowed
to point out your shitty qualities.

39:42.143 --> 39:45.543
Like what?
Like what? Like you're moody.

39:45.576 --> 39:51.244
You're selfish. You're distant.
Is that enough? You want more?

39:52.142 --> 39:56.244
No, that's fine. And as coming from
someone as successful as you are,

39:56.276 --> 39:58.276
I will take it under advisement.

39:59.244 --> 40:01.976
Is that supposed to hurt my feelings
or something? Oh, no, not at all.

40:02.009 --> 40:04.276
I mean, as far back as I can
remember, you've always dreamed

40:04.309 --> 40:06.842
of selling discount
floor hockey equipment.

40:06.875 --> 40:10.775
So when I look at you, I just think
that's the guy I want to take advice from.

40:10.809 --> 40:14.009
Let me do it how he says.
He's got the answers.

40:14.042 --> 40:16.842
Don't take the job.
Won't take the job.

40:16.875 --> 40:18.775
Stay on that track.

40:20.576 --> 40:23.976
I'm gonna go see the girls. You think
I don't know my life's shit right now?

40:24.009 --> 40:27.109
Yeah, well, then don't tell me
what the fuck to do. All right.

40:28.409 --> 40:30.076
Molly and Evangeline.
What?

40:30.109 --> 40:32.909
That's their names
in case you forgot.

40:32.942 --> 40:36.009
Oh, fuck you.
Yeah, fuck you too, Matt.

40:49.142 --> 40:51.208
[giggling]

40:56.275 --> 41:00.442
How did you catch it like that?
Oh! Oh! Touchdown!

41:00.475 --> 41:03.009
Go. Go get the stuff.
[giggling]

41:07.442 --> 41:10.475
Have you noticed that the only thing
Nicole wants to eat is mayonnaise?

41:10.508 --> 41:13.909
I have, yeah. She ate a whole bowl
of it in front of me yesterday.

41:13.942 --> 41:17.009
I thought about submitting her
to an ultimate eating contest.

41:18.542 --> 41:21.009
How's it going
with having Kat around?

41:21.042 --> 41:23.275
Good. We're having
a good weekend.

41:24.375 --> 41:26.009
Just get the minis. Yeah.

41:27.710 --> 41:32.175
Um, how come Nicole's parents don't come down
more often and help? Just out of curiosity.

41:32.208 --> 41:34.242
Well, they have no idea
how sick she really is.

41:34.275 --> 41:36.542
Every time someone comes,
them or anyone else,

41:36.575 --> 41:38.009
she's such a good performer.

41:38.042 --> 41:39.942
She puts on her blonde wig
and her makeup

41:39.976 --> 41:41.909
and she runs around
the house and she entertains,

41:41.942 --> 41:44.275
and makes everybody food
and then they leave.

41:44.308 --> 41:48.042
And they say, "Oh, Nicole's doing
great." And she collapses for three days.

41:48.076 --> 41:49.875
Right. Got it.

41:51.275 --> 41:54.909
Hey. Have you told them
about the affair?

41:54.942 --> 42:00.141
No. No, why? Because once we
agreed to try to make it work,

42:01.076 --> 42:03.375
we said we weren't
gonna tell parents or kids.

42:03.408 --> 42:04.976
Of course.

42:06.342 --> 42:08.042
- [Molly] Throw.
- [man] Throw.

42:08.076 --> 42:10.009
- Throwing.
- [Molly] Throwing a baseball.

42:10.042 --> 42:12.342
- [man] Fighting.
- Punching! Fight! Food fight!

42:12.375 --> 42:14.408
Yes! Yes.

42:14.442 --> 42:16.009
Way to go, Mols.

42:16.042 --> 42:18.242
Good teamwork,
girls. Good teamwork.

42:18.275 --> 42:20.342
Hey, everybody. Hi,
Richard, how are ya?

42:20.375 --> 42:21.942
What did y'all get?

42:21.976 --> 42:26.242
[Matt] Pringles.
Look what Kat made.

42:26.275 --> 42:30.874
Yeah. I know. I saw.
That's great. Hey. Hey.

42:30.908 --> 42:33.908
What? Do you want to get some
rest before I make some food?

42:33.941 --> 42:35.542
No, we're in the middle
of charades, Matt.

42:35.575 --> 42:37.375
Well, you can play
charades from the couch.

42:37.408 --> 42:39.975
I don't want to play charades
from the fucking couch.

42:40.008 --> 42:42.342
Would you rather me just lock
myself in my room all day long?

42:42.375 --> 42:47.041
Would that be easier for you?
Would you like that better? God.

42:48.242 --> 42:50.208
Okay! Who is next?

42:50.242 --> 42:52.375
- [Molly] I'm next.
- [Richard] Evie's next.

42:52.408 --> 42:55.075
[all chattering]

42:55.108 --> 42:58.375
This big and then this big.
This and this. Yeah, that's it.

42:58.408 --> 43:00.107
Yeah.
How are things back home?

43:00.141 --> 43:01.542
Good. Yeah.
They're really good.

43:01.575 --> 43:03.808
Um, Cooper had
a birthday party.

43:03.841 --> 43:05.408
He made us run a 5K.

43:05.442 --> 43:08.375
Wow.
And then we did a pub crawl.

43:08.408 --> 43:10.008
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

43:10.041 --> 43:11.841
Yeah, everyone
was asking about you.

43:11.874 --> 43:15.275
Oh. That's nice.
Yeah. I know. It was cute.

43:15.308 --> 43:18.841
Yeah. Have you talked to
Steve about work or...

43:18.874 --> 43:23.408
Um, you know, I actually think they're gonna
take me off the schedule altogether for now, so.

43:23.442 --> 43:26.074
Oh. Well, maybe that's a good
thing. So when you get back,

43:26.107 --> 43:28.408
you'll be able to look for
something more permanent.

43:29.542 --> 43:32.941
Well, what do you mean more permanent?
I was full time at Red Beard's.

43:32.975 --> 43:37.040
No, I know. But you're not gonna work at
Red Beard's for the rest of your life.

43:37.074 --> 43:39.274
Hmm. Would that be a problem?

43:40.908 --> 43:45.908
Anyway, we're gonna sit down and we are
gonna talk it out next time I'm there.

43:46.941 --> 43:49.741
Is there gonna be a next time?

43:51.107 --> 43:53.508
Well, I just mean that you've been
gone for three months now, Dane.

43:53.542 --> 43:55.975
I came... I came home.
Yeah, for a weekend

43:56.008 --> 43:58.475
just so you could grab
more stuff to come back here.

43:58.508 --> 44:03.808
I mean, I thought that you were gonna be
gone for like a couple weeks. What changed?

44:04.908 --> 44:08.508
What changed is I got here and I saw
that one person can't do this job.

44:08.542 --> 44:15.441
Okay? It's... No, between the girls and
Nicole's medicine and the chemo sessions,

44:15.474 --> 44:20.140
Matt can't do this on his own. Yeah,
but they have other people in their life.

44:20.174 --> 44:22.441
Like Nicole's family.
Let me grab those for you.

44:22.474 --> 44:24.107
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

44:25.507 --> 44:29.040
- Nicole's family lives close by.
- I don't know what you want me to say.

44:29.074 --> 44:32.941
They have other people
in their life besides you, Dane.

44:34.274 --> 44:37.040
I just feel like I'm supposed
to be here right now.

44:38.140 --> 44:40.307
Yeah, well,
people back home are talking.

44:41.541 --> 44:44.974
- What people?
- My family.

44:45.974 --> 44:49.774
My family. They're asking me what kind
of person gives up his entire life.

44:49.808 --> 44:52.407
- His job, his girlfriend...
- I don't know. I would say a good friend.

44:52.441 --> 44:55.107
I would say someone who's running
from something. Jesus. Okay.

44:55.140 --> 44:57.140
Why is it so hard
for you to see my side?

44:57.174 --> 44:59.241
[no audible dialogue]

45:02.007 --> 45:05.841
[man on TV] <i>The first layer will
only develop around three months old.</i>

45:05.874 --> 45:08.107
And we call this braiding.

45:09.007 --> 45:10.874
This is a French braid.

45:15.407 --> 45:17.773
Hey.
Hi.

45:19.407 --> 45:20.940
Where's Kat?

45:20.974 --> 45:23.507
Um, Kat had to get back
to New Orleans

45:23.541 --> 45:26.541
because they're gonna open the
bakery up early in the morning.

45:26.574 --> 45:30.140
Oh. Momo, upstairs. Bedtime.

45:30.174 --> 45:32.107
[Molly] Good night.
Good night, honey.

45:32.140 --> 45:34.274
- Good night, Dane.
- Night, Molly.

45:38.940 --> 45:40.274
[Matt] How was dinner?

45:41.174 --> 45:42.873
Just fine. It was good.

45:44.907 --> 45:46.939
We know you're lying,
Froot Loop.

45:46.974 --> 45:49.973
- Totally lying.
- [Nicole] Spit it out.

45:51.407 --> 45:58.274
Um, I think that Kat is looking for more of a
commitment than I'm, like, ready to give her.

45:58.307 --> 46:01.006
I don't know. I don't know.

46:02.274 --> 46:05.873
Well, I really like her,
so don't lead her on, okay?

46:07.039 --> 46:09.039
I never said that
I'm leading her on.

46:09.074 --> 46:11.374
Well, I just mean that
at your age,

46:11.407 --> 46:15.973
if your heart isn't in it, then you just
have to tell her. Just like, you know.

46:16.006 --> 46:19.140
- It's not that simple.
- Well, the right thing never really is.

46:19.174 --> 46:21.973
Okay, do you have to be so goddamn
self-righteous all the time?

46:22.006 --> 46:25.241
I'm not self-righteous.
Jesus fucking Christ, Nicole.

46:25.274 --> 46:28.939
Oh my God. You need
to grow up, Dane.

46:31.241 --> 46:33.006
[footsteps]

46:33.039 --> 46:36.407
- [Matt] Dane! Dane!
- [Molly] What's wrong?

46:36.441 --> 46:40.139
[Matt] Molly, take Evie upstairs.
Everything's all right. Dane!

46:40.173 --> 46:42.106
[Nicole whimpers]
Okay, okay, okay.

46:42.139 --> 46:45.206
- What's happening to Mom?
- Molly, fucking go upstairs!

46:45.240 --> 46:48.374
- [groans]
- It's okay. I'm gonna take her to the hospital. Will you stay?

46:48.407 --> 46:50.973
Yup. Yup, yup, I got it.

46:51.006 --> 46:54.006
Hey, girls, everything's
all right. I'm coming up, okay?

47:01.374 --> 47:03.006
Thanks, Matt.

47:09.139 --> 47:13.173
I'm really, really, really
sorry I yelled at you, Molly.

47:14.006 --> 47:17.106
It's fine.
No, it's not fine.

47:17.139 --> 47:23.872
I didn't want you to see Mom like that.
I just lost my temper. Okay?

47:28.273 --> 47:32.340
Hello, everyone.
Can we talk for a minute, Matt?

47:32.373 --> 47:33.839
Mm-hmm.

47:50.073 --> 47:52.273
Why are you so hard on your dad?

47:53.306 --> 47:55.139
'Cause he's never been around.

47:55.173 --> 47:56.973
And all of a sudden
Mom gets sick

47:57.006 --> 47:59.240
and he thinks he can just
boss everyone around?

47:59.273 --> 48:01.106
'Cause he's your dad.

48:01.139 --> 48:02.872
Shut up, Dane.

48:06.306 --> 48:08.106
[mocking] "Shut up, Dane."

48:08.139 --> 48:09.273
Oh!

48:11.473 --> 48:13.206
Did you just elbow me?

48:13.906 --> 48:17.073
'Cause it didn't hurt. At all.

48:17.573 --> 48:19.772
[groaning loudly]

48:19.806 --> 48:21.240
Now it hurts.

48:21.273 --> 48:25.206
[Evie giggling]
Molly, you've broken my body.

48:28.073 --> 48:29.739
I saw you smile.

48:31.139 --> 48:35.473
[doctor] Nicole's sleeping now.
The surgery to fix her bowel went fine.

48:35.506 --> 48:39.506
[Matt]
Great. Great. Thank you.

48:39.540 --> 48:43.906
[doctor] When we opened her up,
Matt, the cancer's everywhere.

48:43.939 --> 48:46.006
It's like someone dipped
a paintbrush in it

48:46.039 --> 48:48.738
and flicked it
all around her abdomen.

48:51.039 --> 48:54.805
So... So the chemo's
not working?

48:54.838 --> 48:58.039
No. It's terminal.

49:00.973 --> 49:03.139
So then how long are you...
Are you saying that...

49:03.173 --> 49:05.139
I don't like to give timelines.

49:07.406 --> 49:08.838
Right.

49:10.139 --> 49:13.871
I have two kids
who I need to tell something to.

49:16.273 --> 49:19.938
If I had to say,
six months.

49:24.340 --> 49:26.406
It's going to get
very hard, Matt.

49:27.273 --> 49:29.340
With the combination of
the disease and the drugs,

49:29.373 --> 49:33.473
you're gonna see things from
Nicole you've never seen before.

49:33.506 --> 49:36.905
Confusion, anger, lashing out.

49:42.173 --> 49:45.938
Before this is over, when it gets
hard, and it's going to get hard,

49:46.871 --> 49:49.340
- I want you to call this woman.
- [scribbling]

49:49.373 --> 49:51.038
Faith Pruett.

49:52.373 --> 49:53.771
She's an angel.

49:59.072 --> 50:00.771
I'm sorry, Matt.

50:06.838 --> 50:09.738
[Dane] Hey. There she is.

50:12.138 --> 50:13.306
Hi, babies.

50:13.340 --> 50:14.871
[sniffles]

50:16.506 --> 50:18.239
[Molly] Were you crying?

50:18.272 --> 50:20.972
Yeah, but I was crying
'cause I'm so happy

50:21.005 --> 50:24.172
that we got through this and I
get to come home with you guys.

50:24.205 --> 50:27.205
Come here. Come closer, baby.
We didn't know where you were.

50:27.239 --> 50:28.905
What do you mean?

50:28.938 --> 50:31.905
The nurse, um,
gave us the wrong room number.

50:31.938 --> 50:35.440
Oh. Did that scare you?

50:35.473 --> 50:36.972
Yes.

50:37.005 --> 50:38.105
Yeah?

50:39.573 --> 50:41.738
I'm sorry, baby.

50:43.838 --> 50:45.540
If that ever happens again...

50:45.573 --> 50:47.339
[sniffles]

50:47.372 --> 50:51.172
...you just close your eyes...
go ahead, close your eyes.

50:51.205 --> 50:54.272
You too, my sweet.
Close your eyes.

50:57.005 --> 50:59.038
If that ever happens again,

51:00.005 --> 51:03.205
just close your eyes
and you'll see me right there.

51:04.272 --> 51:06.105
I don't see you.

51:07.005 --> 51:09.205
Look a little closer, baby.

51:11.805 --> 51:13.172
You see me?

51:15.072 --> 51:17.205
I'll always be right there.

51:20.272 --> 51:21.805
Okay?

51:25.571 --> 51:27.805
Yeah. [exhales]

52:27.870 --> 52:30.804
We're not gonna tell
the girls I'm dying yet.

52:32.105 --> 52:33.172
Okay?

52:36.272 --> 52:39.239
Not until my quality of life
declines to the point

52:39.272 --> 52:42.870
where there's just, like, no
more hiding it.

52:45.239 --> 52:47.737
And, um...

52:50.472 --> 52:52.737
And I wanna make a list.

52:53.538 --> 52:57.305
Like a... like a bucket list,
I guess.

52:58.405 --> 53:00.004
Um...

53:05.004 --> 53:07.504
I want to finish reading
the girls

53:07.538 --> 53:09.471
the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> books.

53:10.339 --> 53:16.272
And I'd like to reread all
my favorite books too. And...

53:20.471 --> 53:27.305
And, um, I'd like to write
some letters to the girls...

53:29.538 --> 53:31.504
for certain milestones
in their lives.

53:31.538 --> 53:37.104
Like, you know,
first boyfriend and, um...

53:38.271 --> 53:43.471
their wedding day
and first baby and... and...

53:43.504 --> 53:47.471
just things like that in case
they want to hear my advice

53:47.504 --> 53:51.271
or want to feel me.

53:57.404 --> 53:59.737
I'd like to be blonde.

54:01.004 --> 54:04.371
No, I...
um, I wanna have blue hair.

54:04.404 --> 54:08.837
And I also want to go to New York
one last time and see <i>Les Mis.</i>

54:08.870 --> 54:14.171
And, um, Mardi Gras,
I wanna be a Grand Marshal.

54:14.204 --> 54:19.271
[sighs] And um, I want to sing
on stage with Katy Perry.

54:21.538 --> 54:23.837
- Okay?
- [Matt] Mm-hmm.

54:37.403 --> 54:40.171
That all seems pretty doable.
Does it?

54:40.204 --> 54:45.037
Yeah. Maybe not the Katy Perry
part, but the other stuff.

54:45.071 --> 54:50.804
Yeah. Well, maybe we just tell
her like that Katy Perry knows.

54:50.837 --> 54:54.837
And just say,
"Go, get onstage."

54:54.870 --> 54:57.104
[both chuckle]

54:58.338 --> 55:00.403
You okay?

55:00.437 --> 55:02.437
No, I'm fine.
When I make my bucket list,

55:02.470 --> 55:05.137
I want you to make jokes about it.
Sorry.

55:05.171 --> 55:07.037
[Nicole] Evie,
can you get me the bottle?

55:07.071 --> 55:09.104
- ["Ramble On" playing]
- [Evie] Yes. This?

55:09.137 --> 55:10.338
Yeah.

55:10.370 --> 55:12.338
Can I do it?

55:12.370 --> 55:14.271
Okay.
[giggles]

55:16.370 --> 55:19.503
- Oh!
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

55:19.537 --> 55:21.238
What? I was joking.
I was just joking.

55:21.271 --> 55:23.104
Molly, will you tell me
when it's happening?

55:23.137 --> 55:24.870
It's happening.
It's not happening.

55:24.904 --> 55:26.937
- [Dane] Is it happening yet?
- Yeah, it is.

55:27.470 --> 55:29.037
[Nicole] It just might.

55:29.071 --> 55:30.869
I know. Well,
that's the whole point,

55:30.904 --> 55:32.971
is that it is
a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

55:33.004 --> 55:35.971
Her entire life, she's wanted to
be the Grand Marshal of Mardi Gras.

55:36.004 --> 55:40.137
And she's got a couple days left
and so... oh...

55:41.337 --> 55:46.437
Yes. Okay. Thank you very much.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

55:46.470 --> 55:48.869
How long does she have?

55:52.137 --> 55:53.337
They're saying days.

55:55.271 --> 55:58.970
Yes. That's... Indeed.
Indeed to you as well.

55:59.003 --> 56:02.271
Thank you
and a good day. Indeed.

56:05.936 --> 56:07.403
I want to get in the fountain.

56:07.437 --> 56:09.204
Okay. When?

56:09.238 --> 56:11.104
Right now.

56:12.070 --> 56:15.036
Call everybody.
Dane, call everybody.

I've been so busy. I miss him.

not like he's got a whole lot going on.

The guy's still working the same job at
Red Beard's. Nothing wrong with that.

- This is a friend of yours?
- Yeah, he's an old friend of mine and Nicole's.

their couch in college.

He was just, you know,
our best friend.

01:00:21.436 --> 01:00:25.502
They were inseparable. I mean, most of
the time I felt like they were married.

01:00:25.536 --> 01:00:27.436

thing you know, he's bro-hugging everybody.

He's getting all emotional. He's telling
you, "You're my best friend, bro."

- Right. He's a hugger. There's nothing wrong with that.

01:12:21.098 --> 01:12:23.298
Oh, wow, baby. Thank you.
It kinda itches in the back.

01:12:23.331 --> 01:12:26.131
Does it? Let me see. Oh, your...
Well, your hair's stuck in there, so.

01:12:26.165 --> 01:12:30.232
Can you tie this? Sorry, honey.
Sorry, honey. Yeah.

01:12:30.265 --> 01:12:32.998
Oh, that feels better.
Yeah. Better? Okay.

01:12:33.031 --> 01:12:34.897
Can I have
the candy corn downstairs?

01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:38.232
[Nicole] Yes, you may have it now.
Yes!

01:12:42.165 --> 01:12:43.497
Are you coming, Mom?

01:12:43.531 --> 01:12:46.131
Yeah, I'm coming right now.

01:12:47.265 --> 01:12:49.030
I'll be right there.

01:13:14.097 --> 01:13:15.863
Molly.

01:13:16.531 --> 01:13:18.030
[floorboards creak]

01:13:18.064 --> 01:13:21.197
I can feel you,
my little Molly girl.

01:13:24.930 --> 01:13:27.797
I see you, silly girl.

01:13:29.797 --> 01:13:31.964
It's okay, Momo.

01:13:32.464 --> 01:13:34.030
Hi, baby.

01:13:45.397 --> 01:13:47.698
You want me to come downstairs?

01:13:49.230 --> 01:13:53.397
Good job. You look like you just walked
right out of Woodstock. Trick or treat.

01:13:53.431 --> 01:13:56.197
Trick or treat, sir!
Thank you.

01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:57.830
Good to see ya.

01:14:18.997 --> 01:14:22.130
[Nicole] God, I am so mad at
them right now I could scream.

01:14:22.164 --> 01:14:25.430
What? Why?
[scoffs] Jeannette and Gale.

01:14:25.463 --> 01:14:29.196
They promised they would be here.
That doesn't just piss you right off?

01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:32.196
I don't know. It's probably
hard for them to watch.

01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:37.130
They're gonna fall away one
by one. I'm pretty sure of it.

01:14:37.164 --> 01:14:38.863
Yeah, not me.

01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:41.164
Mark my words.

01:14:42.631 --> 01:14:45.930
By the end of this, you and Dane
will be the last friends still here.

01:14:45.964 --> 01:14:47.830
Would you take that
to Nicole for me, please?

01:14:47.863 --> 01:14:49.330
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:14:56.163 --> 01:15:01.030
[groans]

01:15:01.064 --> 01:15:03.430
Ugh.
Yo, man.

01:15:03.463 --> 01:15:06.230
Hey. Hey. Never saw you as
a doomsday prepper, Matt.

01:15:06.263 --> 01:15:09.130
I know. Nicole just keeps
ordering this stuff

01:15:09.163 --> 01:15:14.363
'cause she wants us to be prepared,
I guess, you know, for... for whatever.

01:15:14.396 --> 01:15:17.863
Yeah. Hey, everyone's around...
everyone's around back.

01:15:17.897 --> 01:15:20.496
I, uh... Did I
see Dane back there?

01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:24.930
Frigging Goldschläger's still living here, man?
You guys charging this dude rent or what?

01:15:27.263 --> 01:15:29.230
No, we're not charging him rent.

01:15:30.964 --> 01:15:33.829
Dane's pulling us through here.

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:36.263
- Yo, ease up, man.
- Don't be such an asshole, man.

01:15:36.296 --> 01:15:40.363
Whoa. I'll give you a pass, man. I know
you're going through a lot right now.

01:15:40.396 --> 01:15:42.964
No, you're not giving me a pass.
I'm giving you a pass

01:15:42.997 --> 01:15:45.129
because you're married
to Charlotte who I like.

01:15:46.129 --> 01:15:48.396
If y'all split up,
let me know

01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:54.729
and I'll drive over to your
house and punch you in your face.

01:16:29.128 --> 01:16:30.996
I'm so ugly now.

01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:34.330
What are you talking about?

01:16:40.396 --> 01:16:44.128
People don't look at me
when they talk to me anymore.

01:16:58.829 --> 01:17:01.262
Want me to tell you
the story of how we met?

01:17:03.463 --> 01:17:05.796
The old Burger Palace?

01:17:08.095 --> 01:17:10.996
We gotta get back
to the Burger Palace.

01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:16.295
Oh, man, that house just had
no idea what was going on.

01:17:18.362 --> 01:17:23.796
Tuesday, around 11:30,
I walk into the Burger Palace in Mobile.

01:17:23.829 --> 01:17:25.362
It's so early for a burger.

01:17:25.395 --> 01:17:29.929
Well, you know,
destiny was waiting.

01:17:29.963 --> 01:17:33.829
And my heart was pounding
for some reason.

01:17:33.862 --> 01:17:37.963
And then you came up to me
and I said,

01:17:37.995 --> 01:17:39.995
"Oh, you know, I'm new to town."

01:17:40.028 --> 01:17:44.329
And I said,
"Would you show me around?"

01:17:44.362 --> 01:17:47.028
And you said, "Why me?"

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:52.729
And I said the only thing
that I could think of

01:17:53.529 --> 01:17:56.095
because it was the truth.

01:17:56.128 --> 01:17:59.829
I said you were the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

01:18:03.462 --> 01:18:06.762
And you said, "Okay."

01:18:14.028 --> 01:18:17.362
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

01:18:17.395 --> 01:18:18.462
[sobbing]

01:18:18.495 --> 01:18:20.729
And you always will be.

01:18:29.195 --> 01:18:32.028
- [Evie giggles]
- [Nicole] He did. He turned around all slow

01:18:32.062 --> 01:18:36.229
and flapped his arms. He looked
like a little baby bird.

01:18:36.262 --> 01:18:38.262
A cute little baby bird.

01:18:39.462 --> 01:18:42.262
- How do they feel? They feel tight?
- Yeah. They're all in.

01:18:42.295 --> 01:18:43.962
Can I plug it in?
[Nicole] Yeah.

01:18:43.995 --> 01:18:45.128
Yeah!

01:18:47.495 --> 01:18:49.062
Why do we need them anyway?

01:18:49.095 --> 01:18:51.861
So your nail polish
doesn't get all smudged.

01:18:52.429 --> 01:18:55.162
[gasps] Oh, my gosh!
Whoa!

01:18:55.195 --> 01:18:58.362
Look at them. It looks like a secret door.
It so magical.

01:18:58.395 --> 01:19:00.262
- Yes.
- It looks like a fairy house.

01:19:00.295 --> 01:19:03.262
- [Evie] These are so pretty.
- [Molly] Oh, you tap it.

01:19:03.295 --> 01:19:06.495
Okay, let's do your next lesson.
I'm gonna teach you how to iron.

01:19:06.529 --> 01:19:09.095
No. That's boring.
No. Do we have to?

01:19:09.128 --> 01:19:10.028
Yes.

01:19:10.062 --> 01:19:12.195
[Molly whimpers]
It hurts...

01:19:13.861 --> 01:19:18.262
- [Nicole] I know. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, honey.
- [Molly] It hurts.

01:19:18.295 --> 01:19:20.495
Hey, what happened?
What happened? It's okay.

01:19:20.529 --> 01:19:23.828
I didn't see her little arm was there.
I didn't see it. What happened?

01:19:23.861 --> 01:19:25.861
Hey.
[Evie] Is she okay?

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:30.728
Yeah. Uh... Hey, Molly. Let's
get some water on that, kid.

01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:39.094
You're mad at me? I didn't do...
I didn't do nothing.

01:19:39.128 --> 01:19:42.828
I'm like the Mona Lisa.
I've been framed.

01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:46.861
Like a painting in a frame.
The Mona... No? Okay.

01:19:49.229 --> 01:19:50.395
Does it hurt?

01:19:50.429 --> 01:19:52.262
Mm, kind of.

01:19:53.329 --> 01:19:55.195
Matt.
Yeah?

01:19:57.795 --> 01:19:59.927
We need to tell the girls.

01:20:04.329 --> 01:20:05.828
When?

01:20:06.362 --> 01:20:07.894
Now.

01:20:10.429 --> 01:20:13.194
[Dane] <i>♪ Who's gonna
see The first raccoon? ♪</i>

01:20:13.228 --> 01:20:16.860
<i>♪ And who's gonna see The first raccoon?
And who's... ♪</i>

01:20:16.894 --> 01:20:20.194
- There's one! There's one.
- [Molly groans]

01:20:20.228 --> 01:20:22.761
[Dane] All right. You know what?
We're gonna give this one to Evie

01:20:22.795 --> 01:20:27.529
- because she's in last place.
- Five for me. Three for Dane. One for Evie.

01:20:27.562 --> 01:20:30.094
I have two.
You have one.

01:20:30.127 --> 01:20:32.361
- [Evie] Two.
- [Matt] Hey, guys.

01:20:32.395 --> 01:20:35.860
Mom and Dad want to talk to you guys
for one minute. You wanna come in?

01:20:43.394 --> 01:20:46.394
Do you guys remember when we
told you all that Mom had cancer?

01:20:46.428 --> 01:20:47.860
Yeah.

01:20:49.662 --> 01:20:55.261
Well, and you remember when we told you that we
would just tell you anything that was happening?

01:20:55.294 --> 01:20:56.827
Mm-hmm.

01:20:58.194 --> 01:21:01.127
Well, we had a long talk
with Dr. Felton.

01:21:02.394 --> 01:21:06.927
Um, and he said...

01:21:09.927 --> 01:21:12.228
that Mom is going to die.

01:21:14.528 --> 01:21:16.860
No.
It's okay.

01:21:16.894 --> 01:21:18.860
It's okay, honey.
It's okay, honey.

01:21:18.894 --> 01:21:21.494
- [sobs] No!
- It's okay, baby.

01:21:21.528 --> 01:21:24.228
No, it's okay. It's okay.

01:21:24.261 --> 01:21:28.261
- [Molly] Mommy! Mommy!
- [girls sobbing]

01:21:28.294 --> 01:21:30.994
[sobbing continues]

01:21:42.794 --> 01:21:46.428

01:21:57.394 --> 01:22:01.194
[chattering, laughing]

01:22:02.894 --> 01:22:04.528
I can't believe
you're doing this to me.

01:22:04.561 --> 01:22:07.261
We can't talk
about this now. Okay?

01:22:07.294 --> 01:22:10.361
- [Matt] Yeah? See what I did for you? Huh?
- Hey, you guys.

01:22:10.394 --> 01:22:15.228
Yay! Hazel! Hey, Peter. Nice to see you.
Hey, Matt. How are you?

01:22:15.261 --> 01:22:18.961
Hi! Oh, thank you. Thank you, honey.
[Matt] Yay. You were great.

01:22:18.994 --> 01:22:20.826
- Thanks.
- You did so good.

01:22:20.859 --> 01:22:23.228
- What was that all about? Everything all right?
- Oh, yeah.

01:22:23.261 --> 01:22:25.094
That was just theater drama.

01:22:25.127 --> 01:22:27.826
You're so cute.
They were so proud.

01:22:27.859 --> 01:22:29.194
They loved it.

01:22:38.793 --> 01:22:40.859
[sighs]

01:23:03.126 --> 01:23:06.261
Hey. Hey, baby.

01:23:07.528 --> 01:23:08.826
Hey.

01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:11.428
Hi. What? Hi.

01:23:12.126 --> 01:23:14.893
I read your e mail
on the computer.

01:23:16.859 --> 01:23:19.494
Said, "He's too much of
a coward to talk to me."

01:23:19.528 --> 01:23:21.893
What have I not talked
to you about?

01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:32.859
What is it?

01:23:40.561 --> 01:23:42.126
What?

01:23:43.993 --> 01:23:47.726
Were you not talking about me?

01:23:51.561 --> 01:23:54.126
- Um...
- Were you talking about somebody else?

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.993
I just, um...

01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:02.126
Who is it?
I just, um...

01:24:03.093 --> 01:24:07.993
I had a crush
on someone. That's all.

01:24:13.126 --> 01:24:14.293
Um...

01:24:15.859 --> 01:24:18.859
That was...
Somebody from the theater?

01:24:20.893 --> 01:24:23.260
Yeah. You had a crush
on that guy Peter?

01:24:29.993 --> 01:24:32.893
Why'd you have a crush on him?

01:24:39.893 --> 01:24:41.826
Did something happen?

01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:48.260
Why don't you just...
We kissed.

01:24:49.293 --> 01:24:51.193
He kissed you or you kissed him?

01:24:51.227 --> 01:24:52.993
We kissed.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.726
Okay, well, I'm leaving.

01:25:04.193 --> 01:25:05.993
No, you should leave.

01:25:07.893 --> 01:25:09.826
- You should get out.
- What?

01:25:09.859 --> 01:25:12.260
I saw you crying last night
and I read your e-mail.

01:25:12.293 --> 01:25:17.260
How stupid do you think I am?
I know that it wasn't just a kiss. Okay?

01:25:17.293 --> 01:25:20.460
You're gonna tell me, Matt,
that on all of those trips

01:25:20.493 --> 01:25:25.360
and all of the months and months and months that
you spent away from us that you never once...

01:25:25.393 --> 01:25:28.026
Never once! Never once.
That never happened, Nicole.

01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:33.060
And don't rationalize it. That never
happened! How long has this been going on?

01:25:33.093 --> 01:25:35.060
Not long.
How long has it been going on?

01:25:35.093 --> 01:25:36.260
Not long.

01:25:37.559 --> 01:25:39.427
I'm sorry.

01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:41.960
You're such a liar.

01:25:42.526 --> 01:25:46.126
Matt, wait! Wait! Wait.

01:25:53.993 --> 01:25:57.160
Can I go over to Mia's house
today? Or can she come over?

01:25:57.193 --> 01:25:58.858
Um...

01:26:08.559 --> 01:26:10.792
Wait right here, okay?

01:26:25.227 --> 01:26:26.858
Matt?

01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:30.992
You okay?

01:26:35.092 --> 01:26:36.758
Uh, no.

01:26:38.427 --> 01:26:40.858
No, not okay.

01:26:43.025 --> 01:26:46.226
You had a husband and a family.

01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:48.260
And you ruined it all...

01:26:49.792 --> 01:26:54.925
because you couldn't resist
sleeping with some old man like...

01:26:55.459 --> 01:26:58.360
Matt, stop! Stop, Matt!

01:26:58.393 --> 01:27:01.959
[Molly]
Mom? Mom, what's happening?

01:27:01.992 --> 01:27:03.992
It's fine, honey. Stay upstairs.

01:27:04.025 --> 01:27:07.326
It's just... it's fine.
There's just, um...

01:27:14.059 --> 01:27:16.359
- [knocking]
- [Dane] Matt?

01:27:16.392 --> 01:27:17.858
Hang on.

01:27:17.892 --> 01:27:20.426
- [pounding]
- Matt, open the door!

01:27:20.459 --> 01:27:22.892
Dane, hang on.
I'm taking a shit.

01:27:22.925 --> 01:27:26.459
Matt, open the door,
please! Matt!

01:27:26.492 --> 01:27:28.125
Oh my God.

01:27:28.526 --> 01:27:30.059
Matt!

01:27:32.992 --> 01:27:34.825
What did you do that for?

01:27:34.858 --> 01:27:38.359
I'm so... I... I was
afraid that maybe you were...

01:27:38.392 --> 01:27:40.025
Oh, man.

01:27:40.992 --> 01:27:44.792
That's an easy fix. I got...
I have a screwdriver in the car.

01:27:45.925 --> 01:27:49.159
[man on TV] <i>It grows in the shade.
So we're in the perfect spot for it.</i>

01:27:49.192 --> 01:27:53.758
<i>And at first it looks quite harmless.
But soon, you won't feel your tongue.</i>

01:27:53.792 --> 01:27:57.025
<i>Your ears will begin to swell and
there will be a burning sensation.</i>

01:27:57.059 --> 01:27:59.125
<i>So here we go.
I'm gonna eat some of it now.</i>

01:28:09.425 --> 01:28:11.825
[gasps]
That is such a pretty sky.

01:28:11.858 --> 01:28:12.992
[Nicole] Yeah.

01:28:13.025 --> 01:28:15.992
Let me see.
Let me see the star.

01:28:16.025 --> 01:28:22.025
It's such a bad sun. Oh my gosh.
I totally... It looks like a sunflower.

01:28:22.059 --> 01:28:23.425
- Mm, let me see it.
- [knocking]

01:28:23.458 --> 01:28:25.825
Hey.
Hi.

01:28:25.858 --> 01:28:28.425
- Who wants to go to Cafferty's for sprinkled doughnuts?
- [girls] Me! Yes!

01:28:28.458 --> 01:28:31.391
Yeah? All right. There's one
left, I heard, so let's get going.

01:28:31.425 --> 01:28:32.892
[Molly] We have to split it?

01:28:32.925 --> 01:28:34.825
[Evie]
Wait, I don't want to share.

01:28:34.858 --> 01:28:36.892
I wanted it to be...

01:28:54.226 --> 01:28:55.892
Do you love him?

01:28:57.358 --> 01:28:58.824
No.

01:29:01.226 --> 01:29:02.824
Do you love me?

01:29:04.226 --> 01:29:05.857
Yes.

01:29:12.159 --> 01:29:15.059
Well, I don't really know
if it's gonna work.

01:29:16.891 --> 01:29:19.159
I don't know if it's gonna work.

01:29:23.525 --> 01:29:26.125
But I'm willing to try.

01:29:49.491 --> 01:29:51.891
[indistinct chatter]

01:30:00.791 --> 01:30:04.091
You know what? Um, what do you say
we pull a couple of these chairs

01:30:04.124 --> 01:30:07.757
and make this whole thing a little
more cozy. Does that sound good?

01:30:07.791 --> 01:30:11.091
Yeah.
Okay. We're gonna do that.

01:30:14.824 --> 01:30:16.958
- [Matt] Hey.
- [Dane] What are you working on?

01:30:16.991 --> 01:30:22.325
I'm just trying to write
something about Nicole and...

01:30:22.358 --> 01:30:25.991
Um, do you mind running to the store
to grab some sandwiches for book club?

01:30:26.024 --> 01:30:27.824
I thought Charlotte
was gonna do that.

01:30:27.857 --> 01:30:29.425
Yeah, so did I. Apparently
her daughter has strep.

01:30:29.458 --> 01:30:34.124
And then Carol Anne and Tracy
also just didn't show up.

01:30:36.791 --> 01:30:38.224
Yeah, I can take a drive.

01:30:38.257 --> 01:30:40.124
Okay. Thanks, man.
Yup.

01:30:55.191 --> 01:30:58.791
[soft rock music playing]

01:31:50.058 --> 01:31:54.224
[Nicole] Matt! Give me back my phone!
Give me back my phone.

01:31:54.257 --> 01:31:57.224
You're posting mean stuff about your
friends online I know you don't mean.

01:31:57.257 --> 01:32:01.224
- They're not my fucking friends!
- You said Gale was a fake liar. You said Charlotte...

01:32:01.257 --> 01:32:03.091
- Fuck Gale!
- Stop, Nicole.

01:32:03.124 --> 01:32:05.290
- When's the last time they came to see me?
- Stop.

01:32:05.324 --> 01:32:07.991
- Give me my phone. I'm still a valid person, Matt.
- Yeah, you are.

01:32:08.024 --> 01:32:11.058
But you gotta take...
I don't want it. I don't want it!

01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:14.823
Goddamn it.
Stop! Give me my phone.

01:32:14.856 --> 01:32:17.490
- Give me my phone back! Give it to me!
- Nicole!

01:32:17.524 --> 01:32:19.756
Nicole. Nicole. Nicole,
easy. Matt, please leave.

01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:22.723
Get off of me, Dane!
Matt, I need you to go, bud.

01:32:23.490 --> 01:32:26.058
Yeah. Why don't you just leave, Matt.
Easy. Nicole, calm down.

01:32:26.091 --> 01:32:29.357
You wonder why I fucked somebody
else, you fucking coward!

01:32:30.424 --> 01:32:33.257
Fuck you too, Dane. Fuck me too.
Okay. Why's that? Why fuck me?

01:32:33.290 --> 01:32:36.424
I heard you two talking about
me. Conspiring against me.

01:32:36.457 --> 01:32:39.357
You wanna take away my phone,
my computer, my credit cards.

01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:42.524
You wanna delete me. You wanna
completely delete me! No, I don't.

01:32:42.557 --> 01:32:45.390
I am still a valid person and you
just want me to die! I know that.

01:32:45.424 --> 01:32:48.823
No. I don't want you to die, Nicole.
Yes, you do. You want me gone!

01:32:48.856 --> 01:32:53.224
You know what? I fucking seriously hate you.
I hate you! I'm sorry you feel that way.

01:32:53.257 --> 01:32:58.390
"Oh, I'm sorry you feel that way.
I'm so sorry you feel that way, Nicole."

01:32:58.424 --> 01:33:00.790
Fuck you! Get out!
No.

01:33:00.823 --> 01:33:02.224
Get out! Get out!
I'm not leaving.

01:33:02.257 --> 01:33:05.257
I'm not leaving. No,
I'm not leaving, Nicole.

01:33:21.390 --> 01:33:24.023
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

01:33:24.524 --> 01:33:28.257
Mol, sorry I'm late.

01:33:30.056 --> 01:33:33.390
Why don't you... Molly,
drop the attitude. All right?

01:33:33.424 --> 01:33:36.823
I didn't do anything that bad.
You've never done anything for me.

01:33:36.856 --> 01:33:39.957
Okay. Listen, nobody's perfect, okay?
Mom always does everything.

01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:41.923
You might as well get used
to that right now.

01:33:41.957 --> 01:33:43.890
And I don't think you're
this upset with me

01:33:43.923 --> 01:33:46.457
because I'm 15 minutes late
to pick you up from school.

01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:49.490
I think you're mad
because Mom is sick. No!

01:33:49.524 --> 01:33:52.490
I'm mad because
I'm gonna be stuck with you!

01:33:52.524 --> 01:33:55.823
[music continues]

01:34:30.122 --> 01:34:31.957
[knocking]
Yeah?

01:34:31.989 --> 01:34:32.989
Hey.
Hey.

01:34:33.022 --> 01:34:35.256
Pack that up.
For what?

01:34:35.289 --> 01:34:37.523
We're gonna take a trip.
You and me. All right?

01:34:37.556 --> 01:34:39.989
I can't, Dane. I can't.

01:34:40.022 --> 01:34:42.856
Matt, you need this.
And Nicole needs it.

01:34:42.890 --> 01:34:45.022
I can't take a trip.
I can't leave Nicole.

01:34:45.056 --> 01:34:48.156
Your kids need it. I called Nicole's
parents to come in for the weekend.

01:34:48.189 --> 01:34:50.957
They're here. Just
pack the fucking bag.

01:34:50.989 --> 01:34:52.289
Don't use the F-word.

01:34:55.856 --> 01:34:59.723
[birds chirping]

01:35:14.022 --> 01:35:16.389
[Dane] You haven't...
That's still a type.

01:35:16.423 --> 01:35:18.223
- [Matt] Yeah.
- Like be more specific.

01:35:18.256 --> 01:35:20.856
Okay. Like a warm peninsula.

01:35:20.890 --> 01:35:27.022
I think nachos are the most fun food because
they... It's like a sharing phenomena.

01:35:27.056 --> 01:35:29.989
[Matt] And what's the joke?
"That's nacho food."

01:35:30.022 --> 01:35:32.890
Nacho.
[laughs] Nacho cheese.

01:35:34.256 --> 01:35:37.323
[Matt] How do you think Nicole's
parents are holding up back home?

01:35:37.356 --> 01:35:39.989
[Dane] Uh, I don't know.

01:35:42.855 --> 01:35:46.722
You don't have to
stick around either. I mean...

01:35:47.456 --> 01:35:48.989
I know, Matt.

01:35:56.022 --> 01:35:59.356
Just so you know,
I'm not sticking around just for you.

01:35:59.389 --> 01:36:01.722
I mean,
Nicole's my best friend too.

01:36:02.921 --> 01:36:04.755
I'm happy to be here.

01:36:05.523 --> 01:36:08.356
[laughing] That's true.

01:36:08.389 --> 01:36:12.489
But I just don't want to leave it.
You're supposed to pack in, pack out.

01:36:12.523 --> 01:36:15.223
[women chattering]

01:36:18.456 --> 01:36:19.988
Oh.

01:36:22.789 --> 01:36:25.189
You see that also, yeah?

01:36:25.223 --> 01:36:27.088
Yes, I see that.

01:36:31.456 --> 01:36:33.055
That's nice.

01:36:39.556 --> 01:36:42.789
What? What's funny to you?
You just did your hair.

01:36:43.489 --> 01:36:45.055
I did not.
You just did your hair.

01:36:45.088 --> 01:36:48.021
No, I didn't.
It was windy earlier.

01:36:48.055 --> 01:36:52.789
First of all, they can't even see us.
They're not looking at your hair.

01:36:53.955 --> 01:36:57.088
Second of all, it's weird to
just sit over here and watch.

01:36:57.121 --> 01:37:00.155
So we should tell them that
we're here so that they know.

01:37:00.188 --> 01:37:04.021
So they don't, you know,
go skinny dipping or something.

01:37:04.055 --> 01:37:06.921
Just say, "Someone's over here,"
so they know we're here.

01:37:06.955 --> 01:37:09.088
Say something. Tell them that we're here.
I'm going to.

01:37:09.121 --> 01:37:11.288
I'm thinking of what to say
so it's not even weirder.

01:37:11.322 --> 01:37:13.955
Just say, "There are people here."
It doesn't matter what you say.

01:37:13.988 --> 01:37:16.523
There's people here!
It doesn't matter what you say.

01:37:16.556 --> 01:37:19.021
- [both laughing]
- Hey!

01:37:19.055 --> 01:37:21.355
Now they'll think that
we're weird in the forest.

01:37:21.388 --> 01:37:24.021
- My friend's freaking out 'cause...
- Come join us!

01:37:24.055 --> 01:37:27.755
- ...we were here before you.
- We'll go away soon if you wanna wait.

01:37:27.789 --> 01:37:30.955
- Come on. Come jump.
- [Dane] He doesn't know how.

01:37:30.988 --> 01:37:33.888
I can jump, but I... not right...

01:37:35.255 --> 01:37:37.455
My friend can't jump.

01:37:37.488 --> 01:37:41.222
- [woman] Come on!
- [women cheering]

01:37:42.789 --> 01:37:44.455
- [woman] All right!
- Go, Dane!

01:37:44.488 --> 01:37:45.556
All right, Tarzan. Come on!

01:37:49.055 --> 01:37:53.088
Holy shit. I'm so scared
right now, you have no idea.

01:37:53.121 --> 01:37:57.088
Aah! Whoa!

01:37:57.121 --> 01:37:58.488
[Matt] Go! Let go!

01:37:58.522 --> 01:38:00.188
[Dane grunts]

01:38:01.921 --> 01:38:04.488
Hello, I'm Dane.
Nice to meet you. Dane.

01:38:04.522 --> 01:38:07.854
[Nicole, weakly]
"And in spite of my...

01:38:07.888 --> 01:38:11.188
So in spite of my...

01:38:17.255 --> 01:38:21.854
Thank God. I'm a happy woman."

01:38:23.288 --> 01:38:25.222
I'll read it to you tonight.

01:38:29.455 --> 01:38:31.355
"'There's no need
for me to say it.

01:38:31.388 --> 01:38:34.355
For even one can see that
I'm far happier than I deserve''

01:38:34.388 --> 01:38:39.222
<i>added Jo, glancing from her good
husband to her chubby children,</i>

01:38:39.255 --> 01:38:42.155
<i>tumbling on the grass
beside her.</i>

01:38:42.188 --> 01:38:47.854
<i>'Fritz is getting gray and stout.
I'm growing as thin as a shadow...'"</i>

01:39:04.787 --> 01:39:09.422
That is so funny.
Oh, my God.

01:39:09.455 --> 01:39:12.322
That's... that's... that's...

01:39:12.355 --> 01:39:16.322
[laughing hysterically]

01:39:16.355 --> 01:39:19.121
That's so funny.

01:39:22.255 --> 01:39:28.088
No. No. No! That's...

01:39:28.121 --> 01:39:29.987
That is so funny.

01:39:58.222 --> 01:39:59.753
I got it.

01:40:00.887 --> 01:40:02.954
Hey, there. You Matt?
Yeah.

01:40:02.987 --> 01:40:06.422
I'm Faith. I'm your hospice nurse.
Oh. Okay. Nice to meet you.

01:40:06.455 --> 01:40:09.753
- Nice to meet you. Hi, there.
- I'm Dane.

01:40:09.787 --> 01:40:10.920
Dan?
Dane. With an E.

01:40:10.954 --> 01:40:12.753
Dane.
Dane is a friend.

01:40:12.787 --> 01:40:15.154
He's just been staying
with us to help out.

01:40:15.187 --> 01:40:16.853
Well, what a nice friend.

01:40:17.355 --> 01:40:19.020
Uh, thank you.

01:40:19.054 --> 01:40:21.120
Beautiful day out, isn't it?

01:40:21.154 --> 01:40:23.820
- [Dane] It is.
- Yeah. It seems nice.

01:40:23.853 --> 01:40:27.455
The experts all week long,
they were calling for rain, rain, rain.

01:40:27.488 --> 01:40:29.488
It's been nothing,
but sunshine.

01:40:29.522 --> 01:40:31.887
I was just texting
with my girlfriend.

01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:34.221
We were supposed to go
to the movies tonight.

01:40:34.254 --> 01:40:38.488
The last place I wanna be on a night
like this is stuck in a movie theater.

01:40:38.522 --> 01:40:40.853
Know what I mean? So I said,

01:40:40.887 --> 01:40:47.087
why don't we grab a six-pack of Corona,
and head on down to the beach. Right?

01:40:48.321 --> 01:40:50.254
Sounds nice.

01:40:51.254 --> 01:40:53.920
Which... Which room is Nicole in?

01:40:53.954 --> 01:40:58.287
Um, she's down here
on the left, end the hall.

01:40:58.321 --> 01:41:03.354
Okay. Why don't you go take a little
rest and I'll handle it from here.

01:41:03.387 --> 01:41:04.954
Um...

01:41:04.987 --> 01:41:07.354
Go sit down
and put your feet up.

01:41:07.387 --> 01:41:10.154
- Okay, Dane, make him go sit down.
- [Dane] Yes, ma'am.

01:41:10.187 --> 01:41:11.853
Okay.

01:41:27.387 --> 01:41:30.853
How about we open up
a window, Nicole?

01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:39.221
Here we go. Ooh,
let some of that fresh air in.

01:41:43.787 --> 01:41:47.387
How long has
Nicole been like that?

01:41:47.421 --> 01:41:52.020
The cancer? Two years. No, not the cancer.
The way she is right now.

01:41:52.521 --> 01:41:54.254
Um...

01:41:56.287 --> 01:41:59.120
I haven't recognized
Nicole for four months.

01:42:00.387 --> 01:42:04.321
And y'all have been taking care
of her yourselves that whole time?

01:42:04.354 --> 01:42:06.154
[Dane] Yes. Yes, ma'am.

01:42:06.187 --> 01:42:09.254
Jesus. You poor things.

01:42:11.254 --> 01:42:13.719
She needs an anti-psychotic.

01:42:15.321 --> 01:42:16.719
Okay.

01:42:17.852 --> 01:42:21.020
Matt, as Nicole's body is dying,
