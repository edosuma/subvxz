- Welcome to TSL Laboratories.

04:07.764 --> 04:09.594
We're happy to have you.

04:09.732 --> 04:11.630
Recently, we've been
getting a lot of questions

04:11.768 --> 04:13.667
about what it is
exactly we do here,

04:13.805 --> 04:15.047
and we're happy to answer.

04:15.185 --> 04:16.911
Of course,

04:17.049 --> 04:19.189
with extraordinary progress
always comes some adversity.

04:19.328 --> 04:22.641
But here our goal remains to
improve the human condition

04:22.779 --> 04:24.194
by any means necessary.

04:24.333 --> 04:26.507
Through extensive and
repetitious testing,

04:26.645 --> 04:29.338
we've taken many steps
forward towards understanding

04:29.476 --> 04:33.031
the vast possibilities for
the human body and mind.

04:34.446 --> 04:36.276
Here, we believe
that time is our ally

04:36.414 --> 04:38.968
and its effect on humans,
a potential positive,

04:39.106 --> 04:40.141
not a negative.

04:41.039 --> 04:43.593
Whether it's by extending
the lives of millions

04:43.731 --> 04:46.216
of sick children or
improving our defense systems

04:46.355 --> 04:48.391
through genetically
enhanced soldiers,

04:48.529 --> 04:51.118
we here at TSL remains
steadfast in our goal

04:51.256 --> 04:54.086
in creating a better
and safer world.

04:54.224 --> 04:56.813
At TSL, we're taking the time.

04:56.951 --> 04:58.574
And we invite you
to do the same.

05:05.097 --> 05:05.926
So funny.

05:06.064 --> 05:07.065
- You...
- It's not gonna happen.

05:07.203 --> 05:08.860
- You're a clown.
[music in background]

05:08.998 --> 05:11.518
- [Gambler Two] You're a
drunk clown, look at you.

05:11.656 --> 05:12.726
- Absolutely no shot.

05:12.864 --> 05:13.865
- I could do it.

05:14.003 --> 05:15.487
- You could not.
- I'm not gonna do it.

05:15.625 --> 05:16.695
- Oh, okay.
- Look at me.

05:16.833 --> 05:18.525
- But I could do it.

05:19.457 --> 05:21.562
- [Gambler One] Okay, 20
bucks, how about that, man?

05:21.700 --> 05:22.529
- Hundred bucks.

05:22.667 --> 05:24.013
- Hundred bucks?
- It's okay,

05:24.151 --> 05:24.876
I'll take that bet.

05:25.014 --> 05:26.222
- Hold on.

05:27.913 --> 05:29.536
- Where is it?
Give me the thing.

05:30.709 --> 05:32.193
- One shot.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.333
Make it count, yeah.

05:34.126 --> 05:36.370
Okay. Go get him, Tiger.

05:37.992 --> 05:39.891
Where's he? It's over there.

05:40.029 --> 05:41.513
Twenty in first, dipshit.

05:47.312 --> 05:48.071
- Oh.

05:48.209 --> 05:49.487
Oh no.

05:51.592 --> 05:53.560
- He's falling asleep.
- Oh my God.

05:59.842 --> 06:02.603
[dart game siren sounds]

06:02.741 --> 06:05.088

06:05.226 --> 06:08.333
- Wait. What are you
paying after, man?

06:09.058 --> 06:10.473
Wait a second.

06:10.611 --> 06:12.199
Okay, hold on, hold on, let
me get more time out of this.

06:12.337 --> 06:13.752
- Whoa, whoa whoa.
Hold, hold it a sec.

06:13.890 --> 06:15.927
Close, but no cigar man.

06:16.065 --> 06:17.238
- Huh.

06:17.998 --> 06:18.964
- Double or nothing.

06:19.102 --> 06:20.138
- How about you give
the cash and call

06:20.276 --> 06:21.898
your boyfriend, dipshit.
- Cash.

06:23.521 --> 06:24.936
- Hey, you ain't
leaving with that money.

06:25.074 --> 06:27.801
Hey, don't touch me.

07:47.294 --> 07:48.916
- How do you know that name?

07:49.054 --> 07:50.262
- Know a lot about you.

07:50.608 --> 07:52.161
- Yeah.

07:52.299 --> 07:53.645
Okay.

07:54.681 --> 07:56.096
- Get in the car.

07:56.234 --> 07:57.684
I have a proposal for you.

07:59.271 --> 08:00.376
- Where are we going?

08:01.688 --> 08:02.827
- You name the place.

08:09.005 --> 08:09.834
- Thank you.

08:17.669 --> 08:19.257
- You don't remember me, do you?

08:21.501 --> 08:22.363
- Nope.

08:23.330 --> 08:24.365
- Name's Addison.

08:25.228 --> 08:27.092
We met at a party
a couple years ago.

08:28.818 --> 08:32.442
[party music]
[Addison moaning]

08:32.581 --> 08:34.583
I guess you were
drunker than I thought.

08:34.721 --> 08:35.894
You were gone in the morning.

08:36.032 --> 08:37.413
- Sorry.

08:37.551 --> 08:38.379
- I'm over it.

08:40.865 --> 08:42.349
- What do you know about me?

08:42.487 --> 08:43.902
Well,

08:44.040 --> 08:46.215
I know you were recruited
to the Ghost Project

08:46.353 --> 08:47.872
when you were 18.

08:48.010 --> 08:49.563
They stripped you of
any legal identity

08:49.701 --> 08:51.634
so if you died,
no one would know.

08:52.911 --> 08:55.604
And then about a year later,
the whole program was canceled.

08:55.742 --> 08:57.709
Most of you ran off,
became work-for-hires.

08:57.847 --> 08:59.331
- Why do you know this?

08:59.469 --> 09:01.437
- I work for some
very powerful people.

09:02.714 --> 09:03.543
- Yeah.

09:05.027 --> 09:06.131
No.

09:06.269 --> 09:08.030
Although, not that
I don't believe you.

09:08.168 --> 09:09.618
No, I'm out.

09:09.756 --> 09:11.412
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.242
- Well, you've been busy?

09:13.380 --> 09:14.484
- Something like that.

09:15.416 --> 09:16.728
- [Addison] How do you get by?

09:17.936 --> 09:19.731
- Odd jobs here and there.

09:21.215 --> 09:22.354
- Two days ago,

09:22.492 --> 09:24.633
there was an accident
at a research center

09:24.771 --> 09:26.393
off the coast of Northern Canada

09:26.531 --> 09:29.120
involving a certain
CEO's daughter.

09:29.258 --> 09:31.674
Currently all
communication is lost.

09:31.812 --> 09:33.918
We need a team to go
in and extract her

09:34.056 --> 09:35.885
within the next 24 hours.

09:36.886 --> 09:38.508
Discretion is
their top priority.

09:40.131 --> 09:42.478
Which is the only reason

09:44.066 --> 09:45.274
you are getting offered

09:45.412 --> 09:46.931
this extremely lucrative...

09:47.794 --> 09:48.622
odd job.

09:53.558 --> 09:54.490
[Chase sighs]

09:54.628 --> 09:56.043
And there's one more thing.

09:56.181 --> 09:57.217
I'm asking Russ.

09:58.149 --> 10:00.634
- That's a, that's a bad idea.

10:01.014 --> 10:02.015
- Why do you say that?

10:02.153 --> 10:04.396
- He can't be trusted.

10:07.123 --> 10:07.986
- Okay.

10:10.437 --> 10:11.956
Well,

10:12.094 --> 10:14.683
I'm gonna have a car
come by and pick you up

10:14.821 --> 10:15.684
in the morning.

10:17.030 --> 10:19.826
You either get in or you don't.

10:26.798 --> 10:29.318
[blues music]

10:45.403 --> 10:48.130
[muffled lyrics]

10:49.959 --> 10:50.788
Nice car.

10:54.446 --> 10:55.309
- Thanks.

10:56.379 --> 10:57.242
You too.

10:59.589 --> 11:00.521
- Name's Addison.

11:01.350 --> 11:02.938
- I know who you are.

11:03.076 --> 11:03.904
- You do?

11:07.459 --> 11:10.221
All right, let's talk.

11:15.571 --> 11:18.263
- Y'all never should have
gone there in the first place.

11:18.401 --> 11:19.609
- Why do you say that?

11:20.093 --> 11:22.751
- Do you know what happened
at your little research site?

11:22.889 --> 11:24.166
- It's on a need-to-know basis.

11:24.304 --> 11:26.064
Oh, so you have no idea
what you're getting yourself

11:26.202 --> 11:27.445
and those boys into.

11:27.583 --> 11:28.688
- Just a good payday.

11:33.589 --> 11:35.418
Were you the one who
sent the death threats?

11:41.390 --> 11:44.565
Look, it's up to you.

11:47.534 --> 11:49.225
We're gonna go with
or without you.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.959
- If I go, I'm in charge.

12:02.204 --> 12:03.274
- I'll get you a team.

12:04.551 --> 12:07.278
[dramatic music]

12:14.906 --> 12:15.735
See you tomorrow.

[light switches clacking]

12:49.285 --> 12:50.666
- Hey, big boy.

12:50.804 --> 12:51.874
Why have we never met?

12:52.012 --> 12:53.358
- Hey. Tag.

12:53.496 --> 12:54.946
- Oh, that's a firm grip,

12:55.084 --> 12:56.051
what you think
about arm wrestling?

12:56.189 --> 12:57.121
- Ah, I ain't got
time for that, man.

12:57.259 --> 12:57.984
- Want some challenge?

12:58.122 --> 12:58.985
- It's always time for that.

12:59.123 --> 13:00.020
Wanna go first?
- Go first.

13:00.158 --> 13:01.125
- Count me out.
- Yeah. One...

13:01.263 --> 13:02.609
- Going down.

13:02.747 --> 13:04.438
- Three, four.

13:08.270 --> 13:10.859
- Fucking dumb asses, right?

13:16.312 --> 13:17.555
You don't remember me.

13:19.350 --> 13:21.835
- It's not personal,
pal, believe me.

13:21.973 --> 13:24.804
- We did the job together
about seven or eight years ago.

13:25.735 --> 13:28.428
Job went well. The
money was shit though.

13:28.566 --> 13:29.429
Not like this.

13:31.465 --> 13:34.606
[helicopter whirring]

13:38.196 --> 13:40.060
- Alright boys, listen up.

13:40.198 --> 13:42.166
- Hey, sweet cheeks.

13:42.304 --> 13:43.443
When are you gonna let
me take you on that date

13:43.581 --> 13:44.547
you promised me?

13:44.685 --> 13:46.204
I picked a great restaurant.

13:46.342 --> 13:47.688
- Colt, spell restaurant.

13:49.621 --> 13:51.002
- Another time.

13:51.140 --> 13:52.935
- There are two
possible research camps

13:53.073 --> 13:56.387
where the target could be
located, north and south.

13:56.525 --> 14:00.011
A team of three will be
dropped off near each location.

14:00.149 --> 14:03.256
Chase, Dex, you'll be
with me on the south side.

14:03.394 --> 14:06.500
Tag, Colt, you'll be
with Russ in the north.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.882
The helicopter will wait for
us at the rendezvous point

14:09.020 --> 14:10.608
until he gets word
from either team.

14:10.746 --> 14:12.472
But if communication goes down,

14:12.610 --> 14:14.405
we'll meet at the
rendezvous point.

14:15.302 --> 14:16.131
Got it?

14:19.859 --> 14:20.721
Hey Tag.

14:22.378 --> 14:23.207
How's she doing?

14:24.139 --> 14:24.933
- Wonderful.

14:25.934 --> 14:27.487
It's my world right here.

14:27.625 --> 14:31.525
Man, eight years old now.
That's why I do it.

14:31.663 --> 14:32.457
- Good to have you.

14:32.595 --> 14:34.321
- Thank you, thank you.

14:34.459 --> 14:38.670
[helicopter rotor whirling]

- Welcome to Gran Manan
baby boys.

15:27.616 --> 15:31.171
It looks like hemp is just a
little further up that way.

15:31.309 --> 15:34.519
- So Addison, any idea
what we're dealing with?

15:34.657 --> 15:36.797
Why the 24 hour time crunch?

15:36.936 --> 15:37.764
- Nope.

15:38.834 --> 15:40.111
Just that it's dangerous.

15:43.839 --> 15:46.359
[music stops]

15:51.157 --> 15:53.124
- Hey Russ, you sure you
know where you're going?

15:53.262 --> 15:54.919
I don't see
footprints or nuthin'.

15:55.057 --> 15:56.127
- I'm sure.

15:58.716 --> 16:00.994
- Why are we heading
closer to the water, Russ?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.790
- [Russ] Because it's safer.

16:03.928 --> 16:05.412
- Yeah, it's safer from what?

16:11.901 --> 16:14.974
[low dramatic music]

16:34.200 --> 16:38.100
[Dr. Antonio screaming]

16:38.238 --> 16:39.895
- Guys? Get over here.

16:48.352 --> 16:50.630
- This must have been
some research accident.

16:51.700 --> 16:52.735
- Let's keep moving.

16:54.737 --> 16:56.049
Russ.

16:58.672 --> 17:01.606
Russ, are you there?
[radio static]

17:03.884 --> 17:04.747
What's that?

17:05.369 --> 17:06.508
- A journal.

17:06.646 --> 17:07.750
For me.

17:08.682 --> 17:09.718
Me, alone.

17:17.243 --> 17:18.209
- Addison!

17:20.660 --> 17:21.695
What's going on here?

17:22.420 --> 17:23.732
- I don't know.

17:23.870 --> 17:25.734
But I'm not sure I
want to find out.

17:27.253 --> 17:28.633
We're not here to ask
questions, remember,

17:28.771 --> 17:30.980
we're here to find the
girl, dead or alive.

17:31.119 --> 17:34.053
So the sooner we do that, the
sooner we can get outta here.

17:46.927 --> 17:50.897
[low dramatic music continues]

18:03.634 --> 18:05.291
- Hey Russ.

18:05.429 --> 18:07.120
I don't think the research
camp's close to the water.

18:07.258 --> 18:09.571
- I know. It's five
miles the other way.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.264
- Hey y'all, we got
turned around out here.

18:13.402 --> 18:15.301
- It won't work. Comms are down.

18:26.519 --> 18:29.177
[water gurgles]

18:29.729 --> 18:30.592
- Hey.

18:32.525 --> 18:33.698
You all right?

18:37.909 --> 18:38.841
- Let's go.

19:00.967 --> 19:03.556
[low growling]

19:18.122 --> 19:21.712
[researcher screaming]

19:27.994 --> 19:30.341
[gun cocks]

19:39.661 --> 19:43.561
[low dramatic music continues]

20:33.542 --> 20:36.235
[quick scream]

20:38.029 --> 20:39.790
[music stops]

20:44.553 --> 20:48.247
[low dramatic music begins]

20:51.250 --> 20:53.424
- What the hell
could have done that?

20:53.562 --> 20:54.908
- Gran Manan, my friend.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.948
- Hello? Hello, is
there anyone there?

21:00.086 --> 21:01.294
- What is that?

21:01.432 --> 21:03.400
- It's a watch I found
at the first body.

21:04.055 --> 21:05.056
- Yeah?

21:05.194 --> 21:06.610
You'll never miss
an opportunity, huh?

21:06.748 --> 21:07.990
- No, it's not like that.

21:10.372 --> 21:11.235
See.

21:13.651 --> 21:16.309
- Yeah, people have
the same watches.

21:16.447 --> 21:18.138
- Maybe.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.968
- All right, nobody's answering.

21:21.107 --> 21:23.558
Let's just get out
there and find the girl.

21:23.696 --> 21:26.008
Her name is Stacey Callahan.

21:26.146 --> 21:28.321
- Like "The" Stanley Callahan?

21:28.459 --> 21:29.909
- Go.

21:37.123 --> 21:39.401
- Whatever this is,
we're not prepared.

21:39.539 --> 21:41.645
We don't have the weapons
or frankly, the skillset.

21:41.783 --> 21:44.130
You think I don't know that?

21:44.268 --> 21:46.477
I have just as much
information as you.

21:46.615 --> 21:47.892
That's the job.

21:48.030 --> 21:49.998
Discretion, remember?

21:50.136 --> 21:52.725
They didn't tell me anything
that I didn't tell you.

22:05.496 --> 22:08.257
[music on radio]

22:22.237 --> 22:25.620
- Anyone there?
[radio static]

22:25.758 --> 22:26.862
Repeat, anyone there?

22:34.629 --> 22:37.701
[low dramatic music]

22:40.669 --> 22:43.223
[low growling]

23:03.071 --> 23:06.350
[animalistic growling]

23:12.045 --> 23:15.221
[helicopter explodes]

23:18.224 --> 23:19.536
- Hello, hello?

23:20.433 --> 23:21.434
Is anybody out there?

23:21.572 --> 23:23.125
- God damn it, it won't work.

23:23.263 --> 23:24.886
- [Colt] How do you know that?

23:25.024 --> 23:26.474
- I just do.

23:26.612 --> 23:28.096
- Hey, where's all
that smoke coming from?

23:34.723 --> 23:37.070
- I really hope that
isn't what I think it is.

23:46.286 --> 23:47.322
- [Russ] Tag, cover.

23:51.084 --> 23:51.913
- [Tag] It's empty.

23:52.051 --> 23:52.810
- [Dex] So he's alive.

23:52.948 --> 23:53.777
- Maybe.

23:54.743 --> 23:56.987
- Shit. Even if he is alive,

23:57.125 --> 23:58.575
we just lost our only way out.

24:06.548 --> 24:09.378
[leaves rustling]

24:33.989 --> 24:36.544
- Don't shoot! Don't
shoot, please, please!

24:36.682 --> 24:38.442
- Who are you!?
- I'm Dr. Garreth Young.

24:38.580 --> 24:39.788
I'm a researcher with TSL.

24:39.926 --> 24:41.100
What happened here!?
- I don't know!

24:41.238 --> 24:43.758
I got here right before
you and, and saw this!

24:43.896 --> 24:47.140
I, I, I, I heard you coming
and hid for obvious reasons.

24:47.278 --> 24:48.866
- What's this?

24:49.004 --> 24:51.559
- He's a scientist. He doesn't
know what happened.

24:51.697 --> 24:52.801
- Really?

24:52.939 --> 24:54.009
- I arrived here after
the rest of my team

24:54.147 --> 24:55.424
on a separate boat.

24:55.563 --> 24:57.116
I, I've been looking
for the research camp,

24:57.254 --> 24:59.532
I must have started on the
wrong side of the island.

25:00.533 --> 25:01.638
Who are you?

25:01.776 --> 25:03.709
- We were sent to you
on a rescue mission.

25:03.847 --> 25:04.779
Not for you.

25:06.021 --> 25:07.402
Do you know Stacey Callahan?

25:09.508 --> 25:10.370
- Come with me.

25:15.237 --> 25:18.517
[dragging sound]

25:18.655 --> 25:20.415
- So what do you suggest?

25:20.553 --> 25:22.037
- That we find the camp.

25:22.175 --> 25:23.867
See if anyone's there.

25:24.005 --> 25:26.490
Or see if they have anything
we can use to call for help.

25:31.357 --> 25:32.703
- Did you know about this?

25:36.569 --> 25:37.432
- No.

25:39.399 --> 25:40.608
- Bull shit!

25:40.746 --> 25:41.781
- Hey. Hey. Come on, fellas,

25:41.919 --> 25:43.127
don't start that shit all right?

25:43.265 --> 25:45.164
- What do you know
you son of a bitch?

25:45.302 --> 25:47.097
What, they give you a little
extra not to say anything?

25:47.235 --> 25:49.375
- Hey, Colt, calm
the fuck down, okay?

25:49.513 --> 25:50.790
- You don't know Russ.

25:50.928 --> 25:52.861
How about you tell Tag
about your little job

25:52.999 --> 25:54.242
a couple years ago.

25:54.380 --> 25:56.140
- You shut the fuck up, Colt.

25:56.278 --> 25:58.349
- I know things.
- You don't know anything.

25:58.487 --> 26:00.593
- I know a bunch of men
died under your watch.

26:00.731 --> 26:01.939
- You don't know shit.

26:02.077 --> 26:04.114
[Colt chuckles]
Shut the fuck up!

26:04.252 --> 26:05.909
- [Tag] Hey!
[gunshot]

26:08.912 --> 26:10.051
God damn!

26:11.259 --> 26:14.089
You motherfuckers are
worse than my kids.

26:14.227 --> 26:17.092
Listen, y'all can work that
shit out later on, all right?

26:17.230 --> 26:20.302
As of right now, since
we got no way outta here,

26:22.063 --> 26:23.409
I think Russ is right.

26:24.272 --> 26:25.584
We gotta get to that camp.

26:26.412 --> 26:27.586
How you feel about that?

26:30.036 --> 26:31.072
Russ?

26:34.454 --> 26:36.422
- Let's go. It's getting dark.

26:42.359 --> 26:43.394
- Well.

26:44.154 --> 26:45.155
There's our target.

26:46.708 --> 26:49.090
- Now we just gotta figure out
how to get her out of here.

26:57.926 --> 26:59.963
We'll set up camp
here for the night.

27:00.101 --> 27:03.552
Try to get a signal and
head to the rendezvous point

27:03.691 --> 27:04.692
in the morning.

27:28.957 --> 27:30.649
Hello, can anybody hear me?

27:32.651 --> 27:34.825
Hello, is anybody there?

27:41.487 --> 27:42.971
- If you're interested.

27:43.109 --> 27:43.972
- Yes.

27:45.594 --> 27:46.354
Thank. you.

27:46.492 --> 27:47.873
- No, thank you.

27:49.598 --> 27:51.048
I know you didn't
come here for me,

27:51.186 --> 27:52.015
but I'm really not sure
what I would've done

27:52.153 --> 27:53.085
if you hadn't arrived.

27:54.396 --> 27:56.226
[flames crackling]

27:56.364 --> 27:58.815
- 750 grand, yo.

28:00.368 --> 28:01.403
God damn!

28:06.581 --> 28:07.893
Tell y'all something.

28:09.411 --> 28:10.861
My baby girl going to college.

28:12.207 --> 28:14.727
I ain't talking about no
regular college either. Mm mm.

28:15.728 --> 28:19.870
Talking about graduate school,
med school, law school.

28:20.940 --> 28:21.941
Sheeit.

28:22.079 --> 28:23.563
- If we get out here.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.048
- All right, baby, I
ain't worried about it.

28:26.566 --> 28:28.016
Going to finish the mission.

28:29.811 --> 28:31.192
We'll find the daughter.

28:31.330 --> 28:32.745
- If she's alive.

28:32.883 --> 28:35.748
- They said alive or dead.
They just want her home.

28:35.886 --> 28:37.060
- Yeah, okay.

28:37.198 --> 28:38.924
They tell you what
happened here too.

28:40.373 --> 28:41.133
I didn't think so.

28:41.271 --> 28:43.100
She's dead, they ain't coming.

28:43.238 --> 28:45.378
- Then we will find her alive.

28:45.516 --> 28:47.449
Call out and they
will send someone.

28:51.419 --> 28:53.145
- May I ask you something?

28:53.283 --> 28:55.388
What happened
between you and Russ?

28:55.526 --> 28:57.011
Why do you hate him?

28:57.149 --> 28:59.634
- I don't know that I hate him.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.015
He may have saved my life.

29:02.326 --> 29:03.431
- You don't know?

29:04.225 --> 29:05.571
- That's the problem.

29:06.503 --> 29:09.057
Russ and I had a job
together a couple years ago

29:10.162 --> 29:11.922
and it went wrong.

29:12.060 --> 29:13.372
Really wrong.

29:14.649 --> 29:17.238
We were the only two
to make it out alive.

29:17.376 --> 29:18.929
First thing that I remember,

29:20.137 --> 29:22.070
being pulled out of
the water by Russ.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.003
Some guy-

29:24.141 --> 29:26.661
- What do you mean, the
first thing you remember?

29:26.799 --> 29:28.007
- Well.

29:28.145 --> 29:31.045
When I came to,
I couldn't remember.

29:32.218 --> 29:33.633
- What, you couldn't
remember what happened?

29:33.772 --> 29:35.325
- I couldn't remember anything.

29:36.567 --> 29:37.948
- Like amnesia?
- Yeah.

29:39.087 --> 29:43.229
I have hazy glimpses
of old memories,

29:43.367 --> 29:46.577
but nothing before
the past couple years.

29:47.751 --> 29:49.822
[Chase scoffs]

29:49.960 --> 29:52.480
Now Russ refused to
tell me anything.

29:53.895 --> 29:56.553
Because of the Ghost
Project it's been,

29:56.691 --> 29:59.176
well, hard to find anything out.

30:02.801 --> 30:03.663
I think.

30:06.011 --> 30:07.875
I think I lost someone there.

30:10.015 --> 30:11.292
Someone that I loved.

30:13.673 --> 30:15.710
I can feel it, you know?

30:17.643 --> 30:21.026
And I'm afraid that Russ
had something to do with it.

30:32.037 --> 30:33.141
- I'm Dex, by the way.

30:34.867 --> 30:35.730
- Dex?

30:38.319 --> 30:39.147
- What is it?

30:39.976 --> 30:41.494
- This.

30:41.978 --> 30:42.944
- Okay?

30:43.082 --> 30:45.050
- [Dr. Young]
This is my journal.

30:45.188 --> 30:46.361
- What are you afraid
someone's gonna know

30:46.499 --> 30:47.638
who your crush is?

30:47.776 --> 30:49.330
- No, look.

30:50.296 --> 30:51.332
These entries.

30:52.471 --> 30:53.748
I bought this journal
before we left.

30:53.886 --> 30:55.923
My first entry was this morning.

30:56.061 --> 30:57.062
I didn't write these.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.064
[journal slams]

30:59.202 --> 31:00.237
- But this is your handwriting.

31:00.375 --> 31:02.584
- Yeah, I know.

31:02.722 --> 31:04.034
But I didn't write those.

31:05.415 --> 31:07.037
- And look, the
hopes good and all,

31:07.175 --> 31:08.521
makes you feel warm inside.

31:10.765 --> 31:12.008
Even when it ain't true.

31:15.218 --> 31:16.875
Ain't nothing
looking out for us.

31:20.430 --> 31:22.018
Why would they?

31:22.156 --> 31:24.020
Look at us? What we've done?

31:26.436 --> 31:30.026
God, or the universe,
don't owe us shit.

31:31.579 --> 31:34.582
[rustling in brush]

31:40.036 --> 31:41.900
How's that fame
same in the dark?

31:42.038 --> 31:43.073
- Shut the fuck up.

31:44.695 --> 31:46.111
- Y'all see anything?

31:46.905 --> 31:47.975
- No.

31:48.113 --> 31:48.941
- I got nothing.

[rustling in brush]

32:04.577 --> 32:07.235
[low growling]

32:08.409 --> 32:10.169
- Man, what the hell is that?

32:10.307 --> 32:11.964
- Do we shoot?

32:12.102 --> 32:14.311
Russ!
- Hold on.

32:14.449 --> 32:15.934
- That thing ain't human.

[screaming abruptly stops]

32:47.172 --> 32:48.552

32:51.659 --> 32:55.249
[Tag groaning and gasping]

33:01.496 --> 33:02.842
[low growling]

33:02.981 --> 33:04.327

[creature growling]
[Tag gasps]

33:13.129 --> 33:16.132
Russ, man, what
the fuck was that!?

33:18.134 --> 33:21.896
[flame crackling]
- Fuck, no.

33:23.932 --> 33:26.970

[Colt screaming]

34:02.557 --> 34:05.388
[Creature growls]

34:05.526 --> 34:06.768
- [Dex] It's impossible.

34:06.906 --> 34:07.631
- What is?

34:07.769 --> 34:08.943
- Okay.

34:09.081 --> 34:10.393
So about eight years ago,

34:11.359 --> 34:13.016
I had a cousin
that went missing.

34:14.293 --> 34:16.606
He went out into the middle
of nowhere and was never seen

34:16.744 --> 34:18.401
or heard from again.

34:20.092 --> 34:22.060
I heard at the site that
they recovered a journal

34:22.198 --> 34:23.647
from the 1940s.

34:25.442 --> 34:28.756
In that journal,
the guy wrote about...

34:30.206 --> 34:31.138
this kind of thing.

34:34.279 --> 34:37.558
He'd find things,
that were the same,

34:40.526 --> 34:42.045
changed.

34:42.183 --> 34:43.253
- Do you mind if I read this?

34:43.391 --> 34:44.220
- Hold on.

34:45.393 --> 34:47.257
Discretion, remember?

34:47.395 --> 34:50.191
- Something extraordinary
is clearly happening

34:50.329 --> 34:51.675
on this island.

34:51.813 --> 34:53.160
This journal may be the key,

34:53.298 --> 34:55.507
not only to help us
understand what happened

34:55.645 --> 34:57.336
to all those people,
to my friends,

34:58.751 --> 35:01.133
It might also give us a
clue on how to get home.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.207
I promise. It'll stay
between us.

35:11.212 --> 35:14.284
[low dramatic music]

35:54.290 --> 35:56.982
[brush rustles]

36:06.819 --> 36:09.719
- [Dex] Guys!
Come out here, quick!

36:22.525 --> 36:23.836
- Impossible.

36:40.715 --> 36:42.269
- [Russ] You okay?

36:42.407 --> 36:44.892
- This ain't my world. Mm mm.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.653
I shouldn't be here.

36:47.791 --> 36:48.654
- Listen.

36:49.724 --> 36:50.656
Something's wrong.

36:52.037 --> 36:53.349
Evil on this island.

36:55.351 --> 36:58.112
And all we can do is
fight and survive.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.251
Okay?

36:59.389 --> 37:01.219
- Yeah, yeah [clears throat].

37:05.637 --> 37:07.328
Right, uh,

37:07.466 --> 37:08.605
walk me through the plan again.

37:08.743 --> 37:10.780
- We find the girl. Alive.

37:12.368 --> 37:14.439
We use the radio to call out.

37:14.577 --> 37:16.095
Someone will get us.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.096
- Right.

37:18.166 --> 37:19.582
And if she's dead?

37:19.720 --> 37:20.893
- She won't be.

37:23.068 --> 37:25.415
- Hey, you mentioned a job
a couple years ago.

37:28.832 --> 37:31.835
[water gurgles]

37:31.973 --> 37:34.252
- That is a long and
complicated story.

37:41.914 --> 37:42.777
- Hi Stacey.

37:45.746 --> 37:47.265
Can you tell us what happened?

37:51.303 --> 37:54.789
[sinister dramatic music]

37:58.793 --> 37:59.967
- She's in shock.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.522
- I'm gonna continue
looking through the journal.

38:09.701 --> 38:10.978
- [Tag] Russ, question for you.

38:11.116 --> 38:11.944
- Shoot.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.015
- Let's say we get
to the camp, right?

38:14.153 --> 38:16.017
And the girls alive,
but the comms are down.

38:16.155 --> 38:17.709
- Mm hmm.
- Then what?

38:17.847 --> 38:19.435
- Then we keep climbing
until we find a signal.

38:19.573 --> 38:20.746
- And if we still
can't find one?

38:20.884 --> 38:22.196
- We will.

38:23.162 --> 38:24.440
- You're a confident man, Russ.

38:24.578 --> 38:25.820
I'll give you that.

38:36.348 --> 38:38.246
- [Russ We're here.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.010
- No girl.

38:43.148 --> 38:44.356
- No.

38:44.494 --> 38:45.668
No girl.

38:49.188 --> 38:50.983
- Hope that damn
thing even works.

38:52.122 --> 38:53.158
- Hello?

38:54.608 --> 38:56.057
Is anybody out there?

38:56.575 --> 38:57.645
Hello?

39:00.476 --> 39:01.339
- Hey, Russ.

39:02.719 --> 39:04.272
- Hey, Addison.

39:04.411 --> 39:06.620
- [Addison] How are you guys?
Where are you?

39:06.758 --> 39:08.069
- We're at the other camp.

39:09.208 --> 39:11.245
This camp is empty.
There's nothing here.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.490
- Yeah, there are uh,

39:16.181 --> 39:17.320
there are bodies,

39:17.458 --> 39:18.528
everywhere.

39:24.741 --> 39:28.366
- But, I found the girl.

39:29.436 --> 39:30.540
Alive.

39:34.993 --> 39:37.409
[Russ sighs]

39:41.033 --> 39:43.795
- [Dex] Can I get you anything?

39:52.286 --> 39:55.393
I don't know what's happening
here on this island.

39:57.049 --> 40:00.259
But I promise you,
you're safe now.

40:21.729 --> 40:24.318
- We got here three days ago.

40:26.872 --> 40:29.047
We quickly realized
that we couldn't leave.

40:30.807 --> 40:31.636
We were stuck.

40:38.297 --> 40:42.129
And then the people who got
here the day before us, they.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.721
They started getting sick.

40:50.206 --> 40:51.310
And their bones...

40:52.622 --> 40:53.899
they start cracking.

41:00.078 --> 41:01.562
I turned into something awful.

41:04.496 --> 41:07.119
When the killing started I,
I just ran as far as I could.

41:07.257 --> 41:08.120
I hid.

41:13.988 --> 41:15.507
- Well, I'm glad you're okay.

41:18.268 --> 41:19.511
We're gonna get you home.

41:24.689 --> 41:25.517
- Thank you.

41:28.106 --> 41:30.004
- Our paychecks
actually depend on it.

41:31.799 --> 41:32.904
So, thank you.

41:33.042 --> 41:35.700
[Stacey laughs]

41:37.184 --> 41:38.357
- Look, we're gonna
take this radio

41:38.496 --> 41:39.427
and we're gonna
keep climbing up.

41:39.566 --> 41:41.153
Try to make outside contact.

41:44.018 --> 41:44.881
- Okay?

41:47.884 --> 41:48.713
- How's Chase?

41:55.547 --> 41:57.066
- Yeah, he's good.

41:59.689 --> 42:00.518
- Okay.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.521
We'll be in contact.

42:04.383 --> 42:05.246
Be safe.

42:14.221 --> 42:16.119
- What is that?

42:16.499 --> 42:17.742
- It's just a journal.

42:21.021 --> 42:22.540
Helps me make sense of things.

42:25.059 --> 42:26.267
- What do you mean?

42:26.405 --> 42:27.268
- I don't know.

42:29.167 --> 42:30.202
Because of who I am,

42:31.618 --> 42:34.379
it's just hard to figure
things out, you know?

42:34.517 --> 42:39.798
But, when I read this
back later, the entries,

42:41.559 --> 42:43.284
I can start to see patterns and,

42:46.218 --> 42:48.324
just makes me feel
a little bit less lost.

42:49.394 --> 42:51.914
- So your friend Dex is a saint

42:52.052 --> 42:54.468
or a little bit of a genius.

42:54.606 --> 42:57.471
Him or some version of him
continued his journals.

42:57.609 --> 42:59.611
- What do you mean,
"some version of him?"

43:01.061 --> 43:03.097
- [Dr. Young] You need
to sit down.

43:03.235 --> 43:04.754
- [Stacey] I have to
tell you something.

43:06.514 --> 43:07.343
- What is it?

43:12.141 --> 43:13.245
- There are others...

43:15.316 --> 43:16.663
that came to kill us.

43:28.122 --> 43:30.815
[Stacey gasps]

43:30.953 --> 43:32.092
- Stay here.

43:54.666 --> 43:56.219
- Well,

43:56.357 --> 43:57.600
here goes nothing, right?

43:59.050 --> 43:59.913
- Hello?

44:01.708 --> 44:05.021
Hello, is anyone out there?
[radio static]

44:08.473 --> 44:11.614
- Look, this is gonna sound
crazy, but as far as I can tell,

44:11.752 --> 44:13.754
the whole island seems to
be surrounded by some sort

44:13.892 --> 44:16.723
of wormhole and
according to the journal

44:16.861 --> 44:19.311
it tends to let
things in but not out.

44:19.449 --> 44:20.416
- So, we're trapped here?

44:20.554 --> 44:22.418
- Maybe. Probably.

44:22.556 --> 44:24.454
- What about the
versions of Dex?

44:24.592 --> 44:26.698
- There seems to be some
sort of quantum event

44:26.836 --> 44:29.011
on the island approximately
every three days.

44:29.149 --> 44:30.598
- Which means what?

44:30.737 --> 44:34.637
- That the island resets
itself on the outside

44:34.775 --> 44:35.983
but not on the inside.

44:36.121 --> 44:37.398
- I, I don't follow.

44:37.536 --> 44:40.781
- Fuck, as in, every three
days a new version of you,

44:40.919 --> 44:44.060
Dex, myself, will all
enter the island again.

44:44.198 --> 44:47.443
Meanwhile, we will continue
forward as we are now.

44:47.581 --> 44:48.962
Hence the items.

44:49.100 --> 44:52.448
Your friend discovered
his journals

44:52.586 --> 44:54.415
and continued the entries
where a prior version

44:54.553 --> 44:56.245
of himself left off.

44:56.383 --> 44:59.213
- So, why isn't the island
crawling with other versions of,

45:00.525 --> 45:02.285
well, us?

45:02.423 --> 45:06.462
Given the bodies, my guess is
that surviving on the island

45:06.600 --> 45:10.155
for longer than three days
has proven to be difficult.

45:12.261 --> 45:15.436
[low throbbing music]

45:39.081 --> 45:40.254

45:40.392 --> 45:43.257
[creature growls]

45:46.053 --> 45:47.468
- Did you guys hear that?

45:48.331 --> 45:49.470
- Unfortunately, I did.

45:51.541 --> 45:53.405
[creature growling]

45:53.543 --> 45:54.682
- It's us.

45:54.821 --> 45:55.960
- What's us?

45:56.098 --> 45:57.547
- It's the last us.

45:57.685 --> 45:58.721
But if it's killing
everyone on the island,

45:58.859 --> 45:59.895
some version of us.

46:01.482 --> 46:03.312
- Hello. We are calling
from a rescue mission

46:03.450 --> 46:04.934
for Stacey Callahan.

46:05.072 --> 46:08.006
We have her alive. I
repeat, we have her alive.

46:08.144 --> 46:09.628
We are requesting extraction.

46:14.323 --> 46:15.186

46:33.445 --> 46:34.308

46:46.942 --> 46:48.598
What the hell!?

46:48.736 --> 46:50.393
- You took, you, you
survived for three days.

46:50.531 --> 46:52.671
You feel that island turns
us, turns every human being

46:52.810 --> 46:55.571
into some...thing.

46:56.814 --> 46:58.712
[creature growls]

46:58.850 --> 47:00.369
- What the fuck
are they, clones?

- Remember. Survival.

I don't do guns.

going to do, man?

[radio static]

53:23.890 --> 53:24.960
- Man.

53:25.098 --> 53:28.377
The last one, the,
the, the mean one!

53:28.515 --> 53:29.792
One looked like me.

53:30.621 --> 53:33.934
It had a knife. Shit, my knife!

53:34.072 --> 53:35.557
And it knew how to use it.

53:38.698 --> 53:41.045
- The longer they're here,
the dumber they get.

53:49.018 --> 53:51.020
- Wha-? The longer they-

53:52.229 --> 53:55.128
Man, how the fuck
do you know that!?

53:55.266 --> 53:56.785
Hey.

53:56.923 --> 53:58.511
Hey!

54:00.271 --> 54:02.446
What the hell are you
not telling me man?

54:02.584 --> 54:04.413
The fuck do you mean,
"the longer they are here"?

54:04.551 --> 54:05.552
- [Representative] Hello?

54:05.690 --> 54:06.553
- Hello!

54:08.969 --> 54:10.108
Who is this!?

54:11.144 --> 54:13.146
- [Representative] I
am a representative.

54:13.284 --> 54:15.769
- We are a rescue team
that has Stacey Callahan.

54:15.907 --> 54:17.495
We need extraction.

54:17.633 --> 54:19.290
- [Representative] I'm sorry,
but that is incorrect.

54:19.428 --> 54:20.533
- No, we have her.

54:20.671 --> 54:23.570
It's complicated, but we
have her and she's alive.

54:23.708 --> 54:25.123
- [Representative]
That is incorrect.

54:25.262 --> 54:27.609
Stacey Callahan is
no longer alive.

54:27.747 --> 54:29.956
- Yes she is. It's complicated.

54:30.094 --> 54:31.923
But we have her. She's alive.

54:32.061 --> 54:34.478
- [Representative] The 72 hour
window has closed.

54:34.616 --> 54:37.929
Ms. Callahan is no longer
a viable rescue.

54:38.067 --> 54:39.414
- I'm telling you.

54:39.552 --> 54:40.449
- [Representative] The company
would like to thank you

54:40.587 --> 54:41.830
for your services.

54:41.968 --> 54:44.177
Unfortunately, we've come
to the decision to part ways

54:44.315 --> 54:45.454
with the current circuit.

54:45.592 --> 54:47.629
The island's destruction
sequence will occur

54:47.767 --> 54:49.700
in approximately 12 hours.

54:49.838 --> 54:52.599
Again, the company thanks
you for your services.

54:52.737 --> 54:54.670
- Wait, no, wait!

54:54.808 --> 54:56.120
Wait!

54:56.258 --> 54:57.294
Fuck!

55:03.438 --> 55:04.439
- Hey Russ, man,

55:06.337 --> 55:08.235
you better start
talking real fast.

55:09.375 --> 55:11.066
What the fuck is going on?

55:18.487 --> 55:20.006
- If you could relive
your worst moment

55:20.144 --> 55:23.147
over again and make
it just 10% better,

55:24.907 --> 55:26.115
would you?

55:34.123 --> 55:36.402
- We should have been
more careful about Stacey.

55:36.540 --> 55:37.989
- We didn't know.

55:40.889 --> 55:42.097
What about your boat?

55:43.719 --> 55:45.411
The one you came here on.

55:45.549 --> 55:46.377
- Uh,

55:47.482 --> 55:48.690
it's parked by the shore.

55:49.587 --> 55:50.899
It's like the helicopter.

55:52.141 --> 55:53.867
Things go in not
out around here.

55:57.112 --> 55:59.563
- [Tag] Hello, hello.

56:01.116 --> 56:02.359
- Yeah, Tag.

56:03.360 --> 56:05.741
- Hey. How's it going
over there?

56:07.364 --> 56:08.951
- We lost Dex

56:09.607 --> 56:10.746
and the girl.

56:11.885 --> 56:12.921
She turned into a, uh-

56:13.059 --> 56:13.991
- What everyone will turn into

56:14.129 --> 56:15.544
if we stay here much longer.

56:17.097 --> 56:18.167
- Yeah.

56:18.305 --> 56:19.962
- I think we came
across the new versions

56:20.100 --> 56:22.068
of whatever the hell
these things are

56:22.206 --> 56:23.621
and the longer they're here,

56:23.759 --> 56:26.003
bigger, the nastier,
the faster, the dumber,

56:26.141 --> 56:27.763
and the uglier they get.

56:27.901 --> 56:29.144
Think it's clear now
that we're a part

56:29.282 --> 56:31.284
of some fucked up
experiment that went wrong.

56:33.079 --> 56:36.393
Oh, and we uh, we came in
contact with the company.

56:38.878 --> 56:39.982
- Okay.

56:40.120 --> 56:43.538
- Yeah. They ain't coming.

56:43.676 --> 56:47.956
The uh, the island's destruction
sequence or whatever.

56:48.094 --> 56:49.302
It's going down in the morning.

56:49.440 --> 56:50.924
- [Chase] Destruction sequence?

56:51.062 --> 56:53.375
- It could have been a
recording, I don't know.

56:53.513 --> 56:55.066
But I'll tell you one thing.

56:56.378 --> 56:58.035
They knew she'd be gone by now.

57:10.219 --> 57:11.255
- Hey um,

57:13.740 --> 57:15.846
I got something
I gotta tell you guys.

57:21.507 --> 57:23.440
This isn't my first time
on the island.

57:25.821 --> 57:27.996
It's not my first time
on this mission.

57:34.899 --> 57:37.488
I went on the same mission
a few years back.

57:38.455 --> 57:41.388
One by one, we were
killed by whatever those

57:41.527 --> 57:44.184
mutant versions of us
are out there.

57:44.978 --> 57:48.465
Chase and I, we escaped
the island just as
it was crumbling.

57:52.641 --> 57:55.506
When we got out there
was this...light.

57:57.750 --> 58:00.373
[water gurgles]

58:09.831 --> 58:10.763
And then this boat.

58:19.219 --> 58:21.601
Chase was unconscious.

58:21.739 --> 58:23.465
Hell, he must have hit
his head or something,

58:23.603 --> 58:25.916
but when he woke up, he
didn't remember anything.

58:31.438 --> 58:32.923
[faint voice on radio]

58:33.061 --> 58:35.477
And they told us it was 2021.

58:38.653 --> 58:40.033
- Okay?

58:40.171 --> 58:41.310
- Look, when we left
for the mission,

58:41.448 --> 58:43.830
it was October 22nd, 2023.

58:47.006 --> 58:48.732
- That, that was yesterday.

58:48.870 --> 58:50.527
- Of course.

58:50.665 --> 58:52.252
It's a worm hole.

58:53.184 --> 58:54.807
- No reason the time
they got to the island

58:54.945 --> 58:58.086
would be the same as
the time they left.

58:59.674 --> 59:01.676
- Look, when we got back,

59:01.814 --> 59:04.851
any trace of our
previous self was gone.

59:04.989 --> 59:07.336
I thought it was best that-

59:09.546 --> 59:12.514
I thought Chase,
let's start again.

59:13.964 --> 59:17.726
- Universe has a way of
preventing paradoxes.

59:18.969 --> 59:21.937
- Russ, why didn't you tell us?

59:22.075 --> 59:23.905
- I tried to stop you.

59:24.043 --> 59:25.320
Us, from coming.

59:26.424 --> 59:28.599
- So you did send
a death threat.

59:28.737 --> 59:31.050
- If I had told you the truth,
would you believe me?

59:31.188 --> 59:32.741
As we got closer and
closer to the day,

59:32.879 --> 59:35.848
I realized that you were
gonna go with or without me.

59:37.332 --> 59:39.368
We were always gonna go.

59:42.026 --> 59:43.959
I just thought that if,

59:45.271 --> 59:48.481
if we could find the girl alive,

59:48.619 --> 59:50.483
they would get us out.

59:51.657 --> 59:52.658
I was wrong.

01:00:11.642 --> 01:00:12.643
- Hey, Russ?

01:00:17.337 --> 01:00:18.511
- Hey, Chase.

01:00:22.273 --> 01:00:25.345
- How did we get out last time?

01:00:25.483 --> 01:00:27.347
- We found an old canoe.

01:00:27.485 --> 01:00:29.522
I already looked for it.

01:00:31.455 --> 01:00:34.700
We paddled our asses
off as fast as we could.

01:00:34.838 --> 01:00:38.048
Left that island in our dust.

01:00:38.186 --> 01:00:41.085
We made it out,
I don't know how.

01:00:41.223 --> 01:00:42.155
- I do.

01:00:42.293 --> 01:00:44.192
At least, I think I do.

01:00:50.129 --> 01:00:51.855
It's impossible to
say how many times

01:00:51.993 --> 01:00:54.720
this cycle has happened.

01:00:54.858 --> 01:00:57.723
But I think your previous
job was the first, last,

01:00:57.861 --> 01:01:00.242
and only time that
canoe was used.

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.176
And I think that canoe was
here before the wormhole.

01:01:03.314 --> 01:01:05.903
- So, how do we get through?

01:01:06.041 --> 01:01:08.216
- The island
destruction sequence.

01:01:08.354 --> 01:01:09.700
- But why would they want
to destroy the island?

01:01:09.838 --> 01:01:12.703
- They don't want to
destroy the island.

01:01:12.841 --> 01:01:14.601
They want to destroy us.

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:18.053
- The destruction sequence
should disable the force field.

01:01:18.191 --> 01:01:19.641
At least temporarily.

01:01:19.779 --> 01:01:21.850
- So if we can get the
boat and drive it through

01:01:21.988 --> 01:01:23.576
when the force field is down?

01:01:23.714 --> 01:01:24.888
- We should be able
to go through a gap

01:01:25.026 --> 01:01:27.718
in the wormhole,
yes. Theoretically.

01:01:31.308 --> 01:01:33.068
[dramatic music]

01:01:33.206 --> 01:01:35.553
- That's about
four miles for us.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.176
- Oh, shit.

01:01:37.314 --> 01:01:38.729
- Why, what's wrong?

01:01:38.867 --> 01:01:41.042
- I remember this spot.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.492
It was crawling with big boys.

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:44.459
- Fuck.

01:01:45.909 --> 01:01:50.879
And I bet these fucking nerds
don't have no weapons in here.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.056
- I believe the boat's
parked right here.

01:01:55.194 --> 01:01:56.747
- It's only three miles away.

01:01:56.885 --> 01:01:59.577
- Let's just hope
it has enough gas.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:00.993
Close enough, we
could make it tonight.

01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:02.580
- It's too dangerous,
not at night.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:05.238
- Yeah, I agree, we
should go in the morning.

01:02:05.376 --> 01:02:07.033
- Fine. First thing.

01:02:13.143 --> 01:02:17.630
- Hey man, have a seat.
Let me talk to you real quick.

01:02:24.361 --> 01:02:25.845
First of all,

01:02:25.983 --> 01:02:29.159
you're a son of a bitch
and I'm real angry.

01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:32.403
- Fair enough.

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:35.648
- But,

01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:40.757
unfortunately, I haven't
been a great father.

01:02:42.793 --> 01:02:46.107
And I'm hoping that
my little girl,

01:02:46.245 --> 01:02:47.971
one day, forgives me.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:54.494
So, even if you do get
me killed out here,

01:02:54.632 --> 01:02:57.670
I want to learn and forgive you.

01:02:57.808 --> 01:02:58.809
- Thank you.

01:03:00.673 --> 01:03:01.536
- Yeah.

01:03:03.607 --> 01:03:05.298
- We're gonna do it.

01:03:08.992 --> 01:03:10.165
- I know, man.

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:16.516
- [Russ] Why don't
you get some sleep?

01:03:16.654 --> 01:03:19.243
- Yeah, I could use some sleep.

01:03:20.417 --> 01:03:21.452
- [Russ] Oh, shit!

01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:22.660
[creature screams]

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:27.458
[gunshot]
[body thuds]

01:03:28.356 --> 01:03:30.910
- What the fuck was that?

01:03:31.048 --> 01:03:35.121
- I'm guessing whichever
scientist was in here before us.

01:03:40.678 --> 01:03:43.267
[Chase winces]

01:03:54.071 --> 01:03:57.005
[low somber music]

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:06.739
- You need any help?

01:04:06.877 --> 01:04:08.189
- Oh.

01:04:08.327 --> 01:04:11.364
No. It's uh, not that bad.

01:04:13.228 --> 01:04:14.057
Oh yeah.

01:04:15.506 --> 01:04:18.199
- Yeah. Actually do you,
do you mind?

01:04:18.337 --> 01:04:19.683
- Yeah, sit down.

01:04:26.379 --> 01:04:27.691
Here.

01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:31.695
- Thank you [laughs lightly].

01:04:36.942 --> 01:04:38.115
- It'll sting.

01:04:39.185 --> 01:04:40.221
Three, two...

01:04:41.394 --> 01:04:42.775
[Addison gasps]

01:04:42.913 --> 01:04:44.881
You all right?
- Mm hmm.

01:04:47.745 --> 01:04:48.608
You know?

01:04:50.093 --> 01:04:54.269
The night we uh,
the night we met,

01:04:56.547 --> 01:05:00.172
that was, that was
about two years ago.

01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:01.483
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:05:03.485 --> 01:05:07.213
- You know, since uh,
ever since you said it,

01:05:08.111 --> 01:05:09.836
I think I remembered.

01:05:10.665 --> 01:05:12.080
Not a lot.
- Mm.

01:05:12.218 --> 01:05:15.463
- But uh, I remember
meeting you.

01:05:18.466 --> 01:05:20.054
Must have been really
drunk [chuckles].

01:05:20.192 --> 01:05:21.814
[Addison laughs]

01:05:21.952 --> 01:05:24.472
- I recall you being a
gentleman, for the most part.

01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:26.094
- [Chase] Yeah?

01:05:26.232 --> 01:05:27.509
- Yeah, for the most [laughs].

01:05:27.647 --> 01:05:29.408
- [Chase] Well, good.

01:05:35.655 --> 01:05:36.518
Right.

01:05:37.588 --> 01:05:38.658
You're all set.

01:05:38.796 --> 01:05:40.143
- Oh, thank you.

01:05:46.425 --> 01:05:47.288
- Hey.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.501
I just wanna say that uh,

01:05:53.639 --> 01:05:55.503
earlier today when
we were ambushed

01:05:55.641 --> 01:05:59.162
and I saw your face.

01:06:01.543 --> 01:06:04.891
I'm sorry that I
hesitated. I don't know.

01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:06.031
- It's OK.

01:06:13.452 --> 01:06:14.522
But I'm here.

01:06:16.248 --> 01:06:18.975
[romantic music]

01:06:41.066 --> 01:06:44.690
[romantic music continues]

01:07:02.811 --> 01:07:05.849
[suspenseful music]

01:07:15.514 --> 01:07:16.894
Stay super close.

01:07:22.831 --> 01:07:24.419
Hey Dr. Young.

01:07:24.557 --> 01:07:27.215
Just outta curiosity.
When did you get here?

01:07:27.353 --> 01:07:28.941

01:07:29.079 --> 01:07:31.530
We still have plenty of time.

01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:47.546

01:07:49.134 --> 01:07:52.137
From there, it's about a
mile or so up the shore.

01:07:52.275 --> 01:07:56.141
We stick to the shoreline
till we get to the boat.

01:07:56.279 --> 01:07:57.935
- Alright.

01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.868

out there man?

01:09:00.688 --> 01:09:04.140

surrounded again.

How are we on gas?

01:09:21.087 --> 01:09:22.227
- Not a lot.

01:09:22.365 --> 01:09:23.469
Enough to get us through
the gap and then maybe

01:09:23.607 --> 01:09:25.368
to the nearest shoreline.

01:09:26.783 --> 01:09:29.061

Should we run?

- We have 10 minutes.

01:10:28.465 --> 01:10:29.811
We should at least distance
ourselves from the shoreline.

01:10:29.949 --> 01:10:31.088
We don't want to
miss our chance.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:32.711

01:10:34.575 --> 01:10:36.301
- Somewhere around here.

- You're not thinking of doing
what I think you're doing?

01:10:40.097 --> 01:10:41.858
- If we go get them,

01:10:41.996 --> 01:10:42.928
we're gonna be just as close
to the force field over there

01:10:43.066 --> 01:10:43.963
as we are over here, right?

01:10:44.101 --> 01:10:46.276
- I'm with next to no gas.

01:10:46.414 --> 01:10:49.762
Chase, you can't be
on board with this?

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:52.420
This man took the last two
years of your life from you.

01:10:52.558 --> 01:10:54.215
He dragged all of us here.

01:10:54.353 --> 01:10:56.459
He is a liar and has
done permanent damage

You know you're supposed
aim for the head.

always off by that much.

wasn't gonna leave him.
