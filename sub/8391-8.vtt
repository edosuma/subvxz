THE BEEPING GAVE THE PARENTS
A MASSIVE HEADACHE.

01:33.740 --> 01:36.459
- OH. WELL, THAT'S AN EASY FIX.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BEEP.

01:36.510 --> 01:37.989
IT CAN CHIRP.

IT'S A STRETCH.

02:28.590 --> 02:30.455
- IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, UM...

02:30.490 --> 02:33.414
I STILL HAVE LOAN PAYMENTS
ON MY EQUIPMENT,

02:33.460 --> 02:36.975
AND THEN I HAVE FEES

02:56.410 --> 02:58.514

I GUESS IT IS SILLY...
TO KEEP THE BOAT.

[both giggle]

08:53.040 --> 08:55.838
- WELL...
THIS MIGHT BE OUR LAST TIME

08:55.880 --> 08:57.529
EATIN' HOT DOGS
ON THE BACK OF THE FRIGATE.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.777
- WHY?

08:59.810 --> 09:01.801
- WELL, BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING
THAT GREAT NEW APARTMENT,

09:01.850 --> 09:04.705
AND WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA
HAVE TO SELL THE BOAT.

09:04.750 --> 09:06.911
- [sadly] MM...
- YEAH.

09:06.960 --> 09:10.578
I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

09:10.610 --> 09:13.989
- WELL...IT'D BE KIND OF
EXCESSIVE, I THINK.

09:14.030 --> 09:15.645
- WHY?

09:15.690 --> 09:17.612
- WELL...

09:17.660 --> 09:20.788
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO PAY
FOR THE NEW PLACE.

09:20.830 --> 09:24.516
AND...YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.176
- BUT YOU'RE A BOAT GUY.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.870
- YOU THINK I'M A BOAT GUY?

09:32.810 --> 09:35.734
- EVER SINCE I MET YOU,
YOU LIVED HERE.

09:35.780 --> 09:38.669
THIS IS YOUR BOAT.

09:38.710 --> 09:42.055
YOU'RE A BOAT GUY,
AND THIS IS A HOUSEBOAT.

09:42.090 --> 09:43.364

-Uaughs]

09:43.410 --> 09:45.719
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD LOGIC.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.741

YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHEER ME UP.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.846
- LISTEN, YOU, ADAM, AND I
HAVE TO QUIETLY SLIP AWAY

10:09.880 --> 10:11.871
FOR THE AFTERNOON.
- WHAT FOR?

10:11.920 --> 10:14.468
- BECAUSE WE HAVE A TRADITION
HERE EVERY TIME WE TEST A SHOE.

10:14.510 --> 10:16.819
I RENT A LIMO FULLY STOCKED,
AND IF THE SHOE TESTS WELL,

10:16.850 --> 10:18.841
WE GO OUT AND CELEBRATE.

10:18.890 --> 10:20.334
AND IF THE SHOES FAILS,
THEN WE GO OUT

10:20.370 --> 10:22.816
AND DRINK OURSELVES
INTO A BUSINESSY STUPOR.

10:22.860 --> 10:25.021
LET'S GO.

10:25.070 --> 10:26.788

17:43.230 --> 17:44.959
AND WE NEVER EVEN WENT
TO THE DANCE.

17:44.990 --> 17:48.403
WE JUST DROVE AND DROVE.
WE DROVE ALL THE WAY TO NAPA.

17:48.440 --> 17:51.785
WE OPENED UP THE ROOF,
AND WE LOOKED AT THE STARS.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.264
- THAT'S IT?
- THAT'S IT.

17:53.310 --> 17:55.824
- HOW FAR DID HE GET?
- WHAT?

17:55.860 --> 17:58.237
- WELL, YOU KNOW, IT WAS
PROM NIGHT, AFTER ALL.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.441
- HE GOT TO SECOND BASE,
AS I REMEMBER.

18:00.490 --> 18:02.276
- THE GUY DELIVERED GROCERIES
FOR A YEAR

18:02.320 --> 18:04.459
AND RENTED A LIMO FOR YOU,
AND ALL HE GOT WAS SECOND BASE?

18:04.490 --> 18:06.594
I MEAN, WH...
- UM, HELLO.

18:06.630 --> 18:10.077
HE GOT TO SECOND BASE
WITH...YOU KNOW.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.497
[laughs] YOU KNOW...
- SARAH BRAVERMAN.

18:12.530 --> 18:13.974
- I MEAN, COME ON.
[laughs]

18:14.020 --> 18:16.739
OH, GOD.
- SERIOUSLY.

18:21.920 --> 18:24.434
- LISTEN, SARAH...

18:24.480 --> 18:27.540
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANNA SHOW YOU.

18:31.070 --> 18:33.061
- THE RETRACTABLE GOLF SHOE?

18:33.110 --> 18:34.338
- THAT'S RIGHT.
SPIKES RETRACT

18:34.380 --> 18:35.654
SO YOU CAN FINISH
A ROUND OF GOLF,

18:35.700 --> 18:37.349
AND THEY CONVERT
RIGHT INTO A WALKING SHOE.

18:37.390 --> 18:39.312
THERE'S THE FLIPPEROO.

18:39.350 --> 18:42.148
IT'S A WALKING SHOE
THAT CONVERTS TO A FLIP-FLOP.

18:42.190 --> 18:45.250
- DID ANY OF THESE GET MADE?
- NOT EXACTLY.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.906
- I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE SHOWING ME THIS.

18:47.950 --> 18:48.848
- WHY IS THAT?

18:48.880 --> 18:50.393
- YOU'RE SHOWING ME
ALL YOUR FAILURES

18:50.430 --> 18:53.126
SO THAT I DON'T FEEL BAD
ABOUT MINE.

18:54.990 --> 18:57.163
YOU'RE VERY SWEET.

19:04.900 --> 19:07.175
- SARAH...

19:09.000 --> 19:11.696
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

19:13.180 --> 19:15.592
- I DON'T KNOW.

19:15.630 --> 19:18.383
- WHAT WOULD DANNY ZELKIND DO?

19:22.090 --> 19:24.706
HMM?

19:27.230 --> 19:30.199
- IS THIS LOVE,
IS THIS LOVE

19:30.230 --> 19:34.189
IS THIS LOVE,
IS THIS LOVE

19:34.240 --> 19:36.128
THAT I'M FEELING?

19:36.170 --> 19:38.684
- THAT I'M FEELING,
YEAH

19:38.720 --> 19:41.609
- IS THIS LOVE,
IS THIS LOVE

19:41.660 --> 19:46.006
IS THIS LOVE,
IS THIS LOVE

19:46.040 --> 19:48.725
THAT I'M FEELING?

19:48.770 --> 19:50.317
OOH

19:50.360 --> 19:53.284
IS THIS LOVE, LOVE?

19:56.600 --> 19:59.080
- SYDNEY, COME HELP ME
WITH MY DRUM SET.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.678
- OH, BOY.

20:00.710 --> 20:03.463
- YOU JUST POP IT
RIGHT ON TOP.

20:03.510 --> 20:05.842
- DAMN, JOEL, YOU'RE GOOD!
- IT'S PRETTY ADVANCED.

20:05.890 --> 20:08.609
- [giggIeSI
- HEY, JASMINE, I'D BE REMISS

20:08.650 --> 20:11.164
IN MY DUTY AS THE LAST
TO MARRY A BRAVERMAN

20:11.210 --> 20:13.235
IF I DIDN'T TELL YOU SOMETHING.
- WHAT?

20:13.280 --> 20:15.236
- IT'S NOT TOO LATE.
- HMM?

20:15.280 --> 20:17.271
- YOU CAN STILL SAVE YOURSELF.
- HA HA HA!

20:17.310 --> 20:18.516
- YOU THINK YOU'RE MARRYING ONE,

20:18.560 --> 20:20.551
BUT YOU'RE ACTUALLY MARRYING
THE WHOLE GANG.

20:20.590 --> 20:22.285
- YEAH. I KINDA SENSE THAT.
- YEAH.

20:22.320 --> 20:25.039
AND THEY'RE ALL CRAZY.
- SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

20:25.080 --> 20:27.002
- NO, THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO.

20:27.050 --> 20:28.597
IT'S INFECTIOUS.
BRAVERMANTITUS.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.733
IT SLOWLY EATS AWAY
AT YOUR BRAIN

20:30.780 --> 20:33.248
UNTIL YOU BECOME
EXACTLY LIKE THEM.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.439
- WHAT? WHITE?
- WHITE.

20:35.470 --> 20:37.574
- IT'S THAT STRONG?
- IT'S THAT STRONG.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.301
- SO JASMINE

20:42.340 --> 20:44.126
THINKS I SHOULD SELL THE BOAT.

20:44.170 --> 20:46.206
- WHY WOULDN'T YOU
SELL THE BOAT?

20:46.240 --> 20:47.548
- WELL, FOR ONE,
I HAVE A HISTORY

20:47.590 --> 20:49.546
OF SELLING THINGS
AND THEN REGRETTING IT,

20:49.590 --> 20:50.659
LIKE MY '68 TELECASTER?

20:50.690 --> 20:53.443
I SOLD IT, AND A YEAR LATER,
IT TRIPLED IN VALUE.

20:53.490 --> 20:55.208
- WELL, THE BOAT'S NOT
GONNA TRIPLE IN VALUE.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.626
THE BOAT'S GONNA SINK.
- YEP.

20:56.660 --> 20:58.594
WELL, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
THE MONEY, YOU KNOW.

20:58.630 --> 21:02.589
I HAD SOME OF MY SEMINAL
MOMENTS ON THAT BOAT.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.631
- YOU TALKING ABOUT
YOUR SEX LIFE NOW?

21:04.670 --> 21:06.490
- NO, NOT JUST THAT,
YOU KNOW.

21:06.540 --> 21:07.871
I CAME OF AGE ON THERE.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.979
I'VE BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH THAT BOAT

21:10.020 --> 21:13.979
FOR A LONG TIME.

21:14.030 --> 21:16.646
AND JABBAR LIKES IT.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.329
- JABBAR'S SIX.

21:19.340 --> 21:21.649
- WELL, THE BOAT'S
PART OF ME.

21:21.690 --> 21:24.306
I'M A BOAT GUY.

21:26.870 --> 21:29.270
AND HE AGREES.
- OKAY.

21:31.770 --> 21:34.421
CROS.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.041
SELL THE BOAT.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.661
YOU'RE A GROWNUP.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.123
- OKAY, LET'S TAKE A BREAK.
- DAD, COME ON.

21:49.160 --> 21:50.718
WE GOT SO MUCH CRAP TO PACK,

21:50.750 --> 21:54.754
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR A BREAK.
- I SAID...LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

21:54.790 --> 21:57.588
I WAN NA TALK TO YOU ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER NIGHT.

21:57.620 --> 22:01.579
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

22:01.630 --> 22:04.929
- I KNOW YOU DON'T WANNA
TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

22:04.970 --> 22:08.280
I KNOW...IT'S HARD

22:08.320 --> 22:12.040
TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS.

22:13.360 --> 22:16.841
- WHO ARE YOU?

22:16.880 --> 22:18.461
- I'M NOT SURE.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.639
- DAD, COME ON.
THAT GUY WAS A JACKASS, RIGHT?

22:20.680 --> 22:23.194
AND HE SAID THINGS HE
SHOULDN'T HAVE AND, YOU KNOW,

22:23.230 --> 22:24.436
PAID THE PRICE.

22:24.480 --> 22:27.711
I THINK ANYBODY WOULD HAVE
PUNCHED THAT GUY.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.751
- YEAH.

22:34.110 --> 22:36.897
ADAM.
- WHAT?

22:39.940 --> 22:43.694
- EVER SINCE
YOU WERE A LITTLE BOY,

22:43.740 --> 22:48.564
YOU'VE ALWAYS MANAGED
TO BE IN CONTROL.

22:50.850 --> 22:53.705
IT ASTOUNDED ME.

22:53.750 --> 22:56.059
AND I...

22:56.090 --> 23:00.129
I SO...ADMIRED YOU
FOR THAT.

23:00.170 --> 23:03.754
AND I STILL DO.

23:08.140 --> 23:11.792
- I GUESS SOMEBODY
HAD TO BE IN CONTROL, RIGHT?

23:13.660 --> 23:15.867
I MEAN, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BALANCE YOU OUT, YOU KNOW,

23:15.910 --> 23:18.595
'CAUSE YOU WERE JUST
EXPLOSIVE ALL THE TIME.

23:18.630 --> 23:20.598
YOU'D EVEN YELL AT A STRANGER.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.017
REMEMBER THAT WAITRESS WHO
SPILLED THE SOUP IN YOUR LAP?

23:23.050 --> 23:25.610
YOU KNOW, OR WHEN CROSBY
BROKE THOSE BLACK CHESS PIECES

23:25.640 --> 23:26.777
MADE OUT OF ONYX,

23:26.810 --> 23:28.744
YOU KNOW,
YOU WERE SO ENRAGED ABOUT...

23:28.780 --> 23:30.668
OR WHEN SARAH AND SETH
CAME HOME STONED

23:30.710 --> 23:32.712
AT 3:00 AM.
FROM THAT CONCERT.

23:32.750 --> 23:34.365
YOU WENT BERSERK ON THAT GUY.

23:34.410 --> 23:36.571
- [laughs]

23:36.620 --> 23:38.542
I WAS JUST TRYING
NOT TO BE LIKE YOU, SO...

23:38.580 --> 23:42.107
THE FACT THAT YOU ADMIRE THAT
IS PRETTY FUNNY.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.036
BUT NOW I'M THE ANGRY GUY,
YOU KNOW?

23:47.080 --> 23:48.524
NOW I'M ANGRY AT EVERYTHING.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.688
I-I'M ANGRY THAT I HAD TO
FIRE PEOPLE AT WORK

23:51.740 --> 23:54.595
BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY,
BECAUSE I WORK FOR A JACKASS

23:54.640 --> 23:56.119
WHO'S BEEN PROMISING ME
FOR 15 YEARS

23:56.150 --> 23:58.118
THAT HE'S GONNA GIVE ME
PART OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANY,

23:58.160 --> 23:59.559
AND HE NEVER WILL.

23:59.610 --> 24:01.396
I'M PISSED OFF THAT I
HAVE TO HOLD SARAH'S HAND,

24:01.440 --> 24:05.649
THAT SHE CAN'T GO AND FIND
A JOB ON HER OWN.

24:05.680 --> 24:08.365
YOU KNOW, I'M PISSED OFF
I CAN'T DO MORE FOR MY SON.

24:08.410 --> 24:09.854
I'M PISSED OFF
THAT HE HAS ASPERGER'S.

24:09.890 --> 24:12.370
I'M PISSED OFF
THAT YOU ADMIRE ME

24:12.410 --> 24:13.718
FOR BEING IN CONTROL,

24:13.760 --> 24:15.614
BECAUSE I CAN'T DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

24:15.660 --> 24:18.481
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT ANY OF IT.

24:18.520 --> 24:20.067
I CAN'T SAVE
THOSE PEOPLE'S JOBS,

24:20.110 --> 24:21.623
I CAN'T MAKE MY KID
NOT HAVE ASPERGER'S,

24:21.660 --> 24:25.312
I CAN'T KEEP SOME ASSHOLE
FROM CALLING HIM A RETARD

24:25.360 --> 24:26.691
IN A SUPERMARKET,

24:26.740 --> 24:30.494
SO WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO ME
TO CONTROL MY FEELINGS?

24:30.530 --> 24:33.704
AND HONESTLY, IT FELT GOOD
WHEN I HIT THAT GUY.

24:33.740 --> 24:38.018
IT FELT GOOD
NOT TO BE IN CONTROL.

24:42.170 --> 24:44.889
I'M JUST ANGRY ALL THE TIME.

24:44.930 --> 24:48.616
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT IT.

24:48.650 --> 24:49.719
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T GO AROUND

24:49.760 --> 24:52.888
PUNCHING PEOPLE
IN SUPERMARKETS.

25:06.190 --> 25:08.875
- I GOT YOUR BACK, ADAM.

25:12.300 --> 25:14.916
- THAN KS, POP.

25:17.860 --> 25:21.546
I'M GONNA GO PACK
SOME STUFF UP.

25:39.390 --> 25:40.869
- OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD.

25:40.910 --> 25:42.912
WE HAVE TO GO.
GORDON, GET UP, GET UP.

25:42.950 --> 25:44.747
I'M SORRY, WE HAVE TO GO.
WE HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW.

25:44.780 --> 25:46.884
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT TIME IS IT?

25:46.920 --> 25:48.888
- OH, MY GOD, I HAVE
TO GET HOME. I DIDN'T EVEN CALL.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.569
THEY'RE GONNA KNOW
THAT I DIDN'T COME HOME.

25:50.610 --> 25:52.953
IT'S 4:30! IT'S 4:30!
- OKAY. OKAY.

25:52.990 --> 25:54.161
- OH, MY GOD!

25:59.590 --> 26:00.818
- AMBER.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.828
AMBER, WAKE UP.
- WHAT?

26:02.870 --> 26:04.132
- SERIOUSLY, GET UP.
MOM'S NOT HOME.

26:04.180 --> 26:05.795
- WHAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.034
MOM'S NOT HOME.
- WHAT TIME IS IT?

26:07.080 --> 26:09.457
- EXACTLY.
IT'S LIGHT OUTSIDE.

26:09.490 --> 26:11.219
- DID YOU CALL HER?
- YES, I CALLED HER.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.969
AND SHE WON'T CALL ME BACK.
- YOU CHECKED THE GUEST HOUSE?

26:14.020 --> 26:14.873
- YEAH, I CHECKED
THE GUEST HOUSE.

26:14.910 --> 26:16.468
SHE'S NOT THERE.
LIKE, SHE'S NOT HERE.

26:16.500 --> 26:17.421
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

26:17.470 --> 26:19.631
I GUESS WE SHOULD
WAKE UP NANA AND POP.

26:19.680 --> 26:22.228
- TROUBLE

26:22.270 --> 26:25.433
SEEMS TO BE

26:25.480 --> 26:27.926
TROUBLE

26:27.960 --> 26:32.545
- YEAH, OKAY.
THANKS A LOT.

26:32.590 --> 26:33.727
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.864
- THAT WAS FUN.
- OKAY. YEAH, ME TOO.

26:35.900 --> 26:36.935
- YEAH. BYE.
- BYE.

26:36.970 --> 26:40.098
- FOLLOW-OW-OWING ME

26:40.150 --> 26:42.141
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

26:48.150 --> 26:51.665
- SHOULD I MAKE IT BACK
ALIVE

26:51.710 --> 26:53.746
- OKAY.
[sighs]

26:53.780 --> 26:58.911
- THERE'S NOTHING MORE
I'D LIKE TO ERASE

26:58.960 --> 27:02.748
AND EVERY TRUCK OR TRACK
[tap on door]

27:02.790 --> 27:06.305
I LAID BEHIND,
SOME...

27:06.340 --> 27:09.229
- OH, YOU'RE UP. HI.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.440
WELL, LUCKY ME.

27:10.490 --> 27:12.515
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
HAVE TO MAKE MY OWN COFFEE.

27:12.560 --> 27:13.584
GOOD MORNING.

27:13.630 --> 27:15.416
HOW IS EVERYBODY?
- HERE SHE IS.

27:15.460 --> 27:17.348
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ARE YOU TRYING TO FOOL US?

27:17.390 --> 27:20.666
ARE YOU 12 YEARS OLD?
- IT'S 6:30 IN THE MORNING.

27:20.700 --> 27:23.396
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

27:23.430 --> 27:26.729
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS,
BUT IT WAS FOR WORK.

27:26.780 --> 27:29.248
- WHAT?
- AND THEN IT GOT--IT GOT STUCK.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.222
- NO, IT WASN'T, MOM.
- SORRY, HONEY.

27:31.270 --> 27:33.738
I'M REALLY SORRY, I--

27:33.790 --> 27:35.712
- MOM, SO NEXT TIME
YOU'RE GONNA BE AT WORK

27:35.750 --> 27:36.887
UNTIL 6:00 IN THE MORNING,

27:36.930 --> 27:39.717
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
AT LEAST SEND US A TEXT MESSAGE?

27:39.760 --> 27:41.022
- OF COURSE, I KNOW.
I JUST--I DIDN'T WANT TO CALL

27:41.070 --> 27:43.413
AND WORRY EVERYBODY AND WAKE YOU
UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

27:43.450 --> 27:44.678
- I'M GE'ITING READY FOR SCHOOL.

27:44.730 --> 27:46.277
- YOU KNOW, HE CAME IN
AND HE WOKE ME UP,

27:46.310 --> 27:47.823
AND HE WAS HYSTERICAL.

27:47.870 --> 27:49.758
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.928
I-I ABSOLUTELY
DID THE WRONG THING.

27:59.220 --> 28:02.747
[whispering] SORRY.

28:02.780 --> 28:05.226
- WELL, YOU'RE HOME NOW,
SO...

28:05.260 --> 28:10.926
- FOLLOWIN' ME

28:12.410 --> 28:14.822
- I CAN'T BELIEVE JOEL
DIDN'T BUILD THIS ONE.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.714
- HE DID BUILD
ALL THE OTHERS.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.729
- WELL, DON'T DEFEND HIM.

28:19.760 --> 28:22.445
- ARE YOU JEALOUS?
- OF JULIA'S WIFE? NO.

28:22.490 --> 28:24.765
I'M NOT TOO JEALOUS.
- HEY!

28:24.800 --> 28:26.722
- WHAT?
- THAT'S NOT VERY NICE.

28:26.770 --> 28:29.694
- WELL, I'M SORRY,
I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT...

28:29.740 --> 28:32.595
FRUSTRATED
WITH MY BROTHER AND SISTERS

28:32.640 --> 28:34.631
AND YOU FOR NOT TAKING

28:34.670 --> 28:36.353
THIS SELLING THE BOAT THING
SERIOUSLY.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.675
- WELL, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO BE DOING?

28:38.710 --> 28:39.847
HOW ARE WE NOT
TAKING IT SERIOUSLY?

28:39.890 --> 28:41.608
- WELL, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
ACKNOWLEDGE IT, YOU KNOW?

28:41.650 --> 28:42.958
EVERYONE'S JUST TAKING IT
FOR GRANTED

28:42.990 --> 28:44.787
THAT I'M GONNA SELL THE BOAT,
AND MAYBE I WON'T.

28:44.820 --> 28:46.879
OR MAYBE I WILL.
I DON'T KNOW.

28:46.930 --> 28:48.090
BUT IT'S A BIG DEAL.

28:48.140 --> 28:51.268
I WISH EVERYONE
WOULD TREAT IT LIKE THAT.

28:51.310 --> 28:53.653
LOOK, SOMEDAY, SOMEHOW,

28:53.690 --> 28:56.659
SOMEBODY IS GONNA HONOR
THE BOAT.

28:56.700 --> 29:00.522
AND THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.
HONOR THE BOAT.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.074
I NEED A HAMMER.

29:06.600 --> 29:10.491
- LISTEN, UM, THIS TRADITION,
YOU KNOW, OF, UM...

29:10.540 --> 29:13.816
THAT GORDON HAS,
IT KIND OF TURNED INTO SOMETHING

29:13.850 --> 29:15.704
KIND OF PERSONAL AND--
- YEAH? SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE

29:15.750 --> 29:16.910
OUT KIN DA LATE.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.291
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
- 'CAUSE I GOT A CALL

29:18.340 --> 29:19.739
FROM MOM AND DAD.
- THEY CALLED YOU?

29:19.790 --> 29:21.849
OH, GOD, THEY DID? WHEN?
- THIS MORNING.

29:21.890 --> 29:22.709
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR YOU.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.785
- OKAY, THAT'S
A WHOLE OTHER STORY.

29:24.830 --> 29:26.752
LISTEN, IT REALLY DID
START OUT AS WORK.

29:26.790 --> 29:28.269
- SARAH, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

29:28.310 --> 29:29.868
IT'S OVER.
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE, OKAY?

29:29.900 --> 29:31.060
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE?

29:31.110 --> 29:32.862
- SARAH, I HAD TO FIRE
SEVEN PEOPLE HERE.

29:32.900 --> 29:33.832
- I KNOW!
- SO THE FACT THAT YOU

29:33.870 --> 29:35.929
AND GORDON CHOSE TO GO OUT
AND GET HAMMERED

29:35.980 --> 29:37.595
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY--
- THAT'S WHY I WISH

29:37.630 --> 29:39.279
THAT MY IDEA HAD WORKED,
WHICH I STILL THINK IT COULD--

29:39.320 --> 29:40.833
- WHOA...

29:40.880 --> 29:42.905
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?

29:42.950 --> 29:44.918
- YOU THINK I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE'S JOBS?

29:44.950 --> 29:45.917
- WHAT'S THIS?
- I DO. HI.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.156
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- NOTHING.

29:47.190 --> 29:48.396
- NOTHING.
- WHAT'S UP?

29:48.440 --> 29:49.987
- NOTHING, MY ASS.
YOU GUYS ARE FIGHTING.

29:50.020 --> 29:51.885
- NO.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.433
- WHAT'S UP, CROSBY?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

29:53.480 --> 29:55.095
- UM...

29:55.130 --> 29:58.714
I'M SELLING THE HOUSEBOAT.

29:58.760 --> 30:01.479
- OH.
- YEAH?

30:01.520 --> 30:04.034
- WELL, I THOUGHT MAYBE
WE COULD ALL GET TOGETHER

30:04.070 --> 30:08.586
AND HAVE KIND OF LIKE
A FAREWELL TO THE--TO THE BOAT.

30:08.630 --> 30:10.143
- FARE-FAREWELL TO THE BOAT
PARTY?

30:10.180 --> 30:11.932
- YEAH, A FAREWELL TO THE BOAT.

30:11.980 --> 30:13.732
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT--
- IT HAPPENS TO BE

30:13.770 --> 30:14.737
WHERE I BECAME AN ADULT.

30:14.770 --> 30:16.738
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE
I'VE EVER CALLED HOME,

30:16.780 --> 30:17.735
OTHER THAN MOM AND DAD'S.

30:17.780 --> 30:19.111
- WHEN'S THE FAREWELL PARTY
FOR THE BOAT?

30:19.160 --> 30:20.639
- IMMEDIATELY. TONIGHT.
- OH, GOD.

30:20.680 --> 30:23.319
- CROSBY, OBVIOUSLY, I NEED
MORE NOTICE THAN THE DAY OF.

30:23.370 --> 30:25.338
- I GOT IN TROUBLE LAST NIGHT.
I CAN'T. I CAN'T.

30:25.370 --> 30:26.883
- WHAT ARE YOU TALK--
YOU NEED NOT--

30:26.920 --> 30:28.399
YOU'RE NOT THE PRESIDENT.

30:28.440 --> 30:30.089
YOU THINK NEIL ARMSTRONG
GAVE NOTICE

30:30.130 --> 30:31.859
WHEN HE MADE
A SMALL STEP FOR MAN

30:31.890 --> 30:35.348
AND A GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND?

30:35.380 --> 30:37.757
- WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M PRETTY
SURE THAT THEY PLANNED ON THAT

30:37.800 --> 30:38.869
FOR WELL OVER
A DECADE, SO...

30:38.900 --> 30:41.653
- I THINK SOME PEOPLE
HAD NOTICE, LIKE HIS WIFE.

30:41.700 --> 30:43.930
- YOU GET WHAT I'M SAYING.

30:43.980 --> 30:46.210
LISTEN, CROSBY'S GONNA MAKE
A GIGANTIC LEAP,

30:46.250 --> 30:49.526
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU GUYS
WOULD WANNA BE THERE.

30:49.570 --> 30:51.777
both: OH, IF CROSBY'S...
- ABOUT TO MAKE A GIANT LEAP.

30:51.810 --> 30:53.084
- THEN I WANNA BE THERE,
FOR SURE.

30:53.120 --> 30:56.055
- YEAH, IF CROSBY IS, THEN I'M
GONNA DO MY BEST TO BE THERE.

30:56.090 --> 30:58.502
- CROSBY SHOULD KNOW THAT
SARAH'S GONNA TRY TO BE THERE.

30:58.540 --> 30:59.950
- YEAH, OKAY.
YOU GUYS WERE IN A FIGHT,

30:59.990 --> 31:01.855
AND NOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO BRING ME INTO IT.

31:01.890 --> 31:03.926
BUT I'M NOT REALLY
INTERESTED IN THAT.

31:03.960 --> 31:07.020
I'VE KINDA GOT MY OWN STUFF.
GLAD I COULD AMUSE YOU.

31:07.070 --> 31:08.958
- I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO,
CROS.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.207
GET BACK TO WORK.
- OKAY.

31:12.210 --> 31:14.587
- HEY, ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

31:17.840 --> 31:18.909
- HEY.

31:18.940 --> 31:20.419
UH, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

31:20.460 --> 31:22.940
ARE YOU BUSY, OR--
- YEAH, SURE, COME IN.

31:22.980 --> 31:26.017
- OKAY. UM...

31:26.050 --> 31:29.019
I JUST WANTED TO...
APOLOGIZE FOR YESTERDAY

31:29.050 --> 31:31.746
AND SAY THAT I HOPE
IT DOESN'T

31:31.780 --> 31:34.157
INTERFERE WITH, YOU KNOW,
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING HERE.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.361
'CAUSE I WANNA KEEP DOING IT.

31:49.900 --> 31:52.346
- I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

31:52.390 --> 31:55.279
I'VE BEEN IN RECOVERY
FOR FIVE MONTHS...

31:55.320 --> 31:57.948
AND I'M TELLING YOU THIS
BECAUSE

31:57.980 --> 32:00.972
RELATIONSHIPS,
ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS,

32:01.020 --> 32:03.227
JUST AREN'T GOOD FOR ME
RIGHT NOW.

32:04.990 --> 32:06.366
- YEAH. OKAY.

32:06.400 --> 32:07.844
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO TAKE
THIS THE WRONG WAY EITHER,

32:07.890 --> 32:10.677
BECAUSE...

32:10.720 --> 32:12.290
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU.

32:12.340 --> 32:13.819
AND IT'S NOT THAT
YOU'RE NOT A'ITRACT IVE,

32:13.860 --> 32:15.999
BECAUSE YOU ARE.

32:16.030 --> 32:18.851
YOU'RE REALLY AMAZING,
ACTUALLY.

32:18.900 --> 32:20.379
IT'S JUST I'M NOT IN A PLACE

32:20.420 --> 32:23.583
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT
THOSE FEELINGS RIGHT NOW.

32:23.630 --> 32:25.689
- OKAY.

32:25.730 --> 32:27.652
- YOU UNDERSTAND?
LIKE...

32:27.700 --> 32:30.248
- UH...

32:32.430 --> 32:34.739
IS THAT WHY YOU--
YOU DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL?

32:34.780 --> 32:37.567
'CAUSE OF DRINKING?
- THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS.

32:37.610 --> 32:38.941
YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

32:38.990 --> 32:41.129
AND YOU...
THEN YOU GO TO MEETINGS.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.843
- MEETINGS.
I HAVE A SPONSOR.

32:42.890 --> 32:45.472
WORK WITH THE PROGRAM.
THE WHOLE NINE.

32:48.580 --> 32:50.957
- THAT'S A LOT.

32:56.250 --> 32:57.274
- YEAH.

33:01.870 --> 33:04.043
- UH...WELL,

33:04.080 --> 33:06.799
CAN'T WAIT TO WRITE

33:07.810 --> 33:09.459
- YEAH. YEAH. MM-HMM.

33:09.500 --> 33:13.015
- "DEAR DIARY, I TALKED TO
A DROPOUT ALCOHOLIC."

33:13.060 --> 33:16.086
[laughs] SORRY. "HE WAS GREAT.
HE WAS SO NICE."

33:16.130 --> 33:18.121
- REALLY?
- I HAD NO IDEA.

33:18.160 --> 33:21.049
- JUST...A NORMAL GUY.
- YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.955

I SAID TO MYSELF

33:35.940 --> 33:39.000
THINGS THAT COME WITH TIME

33:39.050 --> 33:44.010
WILL ALWAYS BE BE'ITER

33:44.050 --> 33:46.769
[overlapping chatter,
laughter]

33:46.810 --> 33:50.052
- WELL, THERE WAS THAT ONE TIME
YOU WERE ON TOUR IN AUSTRALIA...

33:50.090 --> 33:50.943
- UH-HUH.

33:50.990 --> 33:54.027
- AND IT HIT ME,
MOM AND DAD HAD SYDNEY

33:54.060 --> 33:56.574
AND JOEL AND I HAD
DINNER RESERVATIONS,

33:56.620 --> 33:59.828
AND WE NEVER MADE IT
TO THE DINNER RESERVATIONS.

33:59.860 --> 34:01.304
WE JUST--

34:01.340 --> 34:03.228
- WE JUST CAME HERE.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.271
- WE...USED IT ALL UP.

34:05.310 --> 34:07.130
- REALLY?
YOU AND JOEL?

34:07.180 --> 34:09.455
- YOU DID?
- YES. IS IT THAT SURPRISING?

34:09.490 --> 34:10.934
- UM, THE JOEL PART.
YEAH.

34:10.970 --> 34:13.666
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU'RE SELLING IT

34:13.700 --> 34:16.077
BEFORE I GOT A CHANCE TO DO
SOMETHING FOR US HERE.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.109
- HOW 'BOUT YOU, ADAM?

34:17.150 --> 34:19.948
DID YOU EVER USE MY HOME
AS A CHEAP HOURLY MOTEL?

34:19.980 --> 34:22.869
- OH, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.126
OF COURSE I HAVE.

34:24.160 --> 34:25.229

34:25.270 --> 34:26.157
- NO, YOU HAVEN'T!

34:26.200 --> 34:27.644
- WHEN?
- WITH WHO?

34:27.680 --> 34:29.409
[laughter]

34:29.440 --> 34:31.544
- COUPLE OF TIMES, KRISTINA
AND I WENT INTO THE CITY,

34:31.580 --> 34:33.753
AND HADDIE HAD A BABYSI'ITER
AND WE...

34:33.790 --> 34:35.098

34:35.140 --> 34:36.994

34:37.040 --> 34:38.234
- OH, MY GOD!
- OH!

34:38.280 --> 34:41.204
- LI'ITLE DID I KNOW I WAS
LIVING ON A FLOATING BROTHEL.

34:41.250 --> 34:44.105
- EVERYTHING'S BE'ITER
IN THE SALT AIR.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.072
- I GO'ITA SAY, I'M, UH...

34:46.110 --> 34:48.351
I'M KINDA SCARED.

34:48.390 --> 34:50.039

34:50.080 --> 34:52.947

34:52.980 --> 34:54.083
- ABOUT MARRIAGE?

34:54.120 --> 34:56.259
- ABOUT SCREWING
THE WHOLE THING UP.

34:56.300 --> 34:59.189
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S A BIG CHANGE.

34:59.230 --> 35:01.221
IT'S NORMAL
THAT YOU FEEL SCARED.

35:01.270 --> 35:02.749
I'D BE WORRIED
IF YOU DIDN'T FEEL THAT WAY.

35:02.790 --> 35:05.122
- YEAH. WELL, I HAVE SCREWED UP
EVERY RELATIONSHIP

35:05.170 --> 35:07.126
I'VE EVER HAD, SO...

35:07.170 --> 35:09.058
- WELL, THIS ONE'S DIFFERENT.

35:09.100 --> 35:11.091

35:11.140 --> 35:13.449

35:35.200 --> 35:36.599

35:38.650 --> 35:40.333
WHEN HE TOOK THAT FIRST
STEP ON THE MOON?

35:40.370 --> 35:41.166
- DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.168

35:55.110 --> 35:56.384
- [laughs]

YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

36:39.810 --> 36:42.677
CARRY ON.

36:42.710 --> 36:45.019
TOUGH ROOM.

36:45.060 --> 36:46.846

ONE SMALL BREAK?

36:46.890 --> 36:49.882
SERIOUSLY. DID I EVER

36:59.660 --> 37:03.073
SO WHAT'S THE STORY

37:42.150 --> 37:45.779

MY RO'ITEN LITTLE BRATS.

37:45.810 --> 37:48.290

37:57.820 --> 38:00.448

38:02.280 --> 38:03.440
[spits]
HOW'D IT GO?

38:03.480 --> 38:05.926
- OH, IT WAS FUN.
- MM-HMM.

38:05.970 --> 38:08.347
- IT WAS...TYPICAL CROSBY.

38:08.380 --> 38:09.517
A LO'ITA DRINKS
AND NO FOOD.

38:09.560 --> 38:11.414
- YEP.

38:15.290 --> 38:17.758
- I PUNCHED A GUY
THE OTHER DAY.

38:22.190 --> 38:25.466
- WHAT?

38:25.510 --> 38:29.367
- IT WAS AT THE SUPERMARKET.
I HIT A GUY.

38:29.410 --> 38:32.538
WE WERE, UH, STANDING
IN THE EXPRESS LINE,

38:32.580 --> 38:34.855
AND MAX GOT UPSET BECAUSE--
YOU KNOW, HE COUNTED

38:34.890 --> 38:37.711
THAT THE GUY HAD 17 ITEMS
INSTEAD OF 10,

38:37.760 --> 38:39.819
AND, UH...
SOME WORDS WERE EXCHANGED.

38:39.860 --> 38:43.318
HE CALLED MAX A RETARD,
AND I HIT HIM.

38:43.350 --> 38:44.829
- WAIT A MINUTE.

38:44.870 --> 38:47.077
HE CALLED MAX A RETARD.

38:47.110 --> 38:48.099
- YEAH.
- HMM.

38:50.050 --> 38:52.325
I'M GLAD YOU HIT HIM.

38:52.360 --> 38:54.009
IS THE GUY OKAY?

38:54.050 --> 38:56.632
- HE'LL LIVE.

38:56.670 --> 38:59.491
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS?

39:01.130 --> 39:02.916
- I WAS EMBARRASSED.

39:02.960 --> 39:05.269
- HONEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
EMBARRASSED WITH ME.

39:05.300 --> 39:07.473
I'M YOUR WIFE, YOU KNOW?

39:09.930 --> 39:11.716
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON, KRISTINE.

39:11.760 --> 39:13.204
I'M JUST--
I'M ANGRY ALL THE TIME,

39:13.240 --> 39:15.959
AND I'M ANGRY
FOR BEING ANGRY BUT...

39:17.630 --> 39:19.245
I AM UNDER
ALL THIS STRESS,

39:19.280 --> 39:22.386
AND I KNOW THAT'S NO EXCUSE,
BUT...

39:22.420 --> 39:24.627
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE SCARY THING IS?

39:24.670 --> 39:25.762
- HMM?

39:25.810 --> 39:28.040
- IT FELT GREAT.

39:28.080 --> 39:31.288
IT FELT REALLY GREAT.

39:31.330 --> 39:33.639
IT'S LIKE
A LITTLE BIT OF JUSTICE.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.982
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'M A LITTLE
MORE LIKE MY DAD

39:38.030 --> 39:40.407
THAN I WANT TO ADMIT.

39:40.440 --> 39:43.546
- OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

39:43.580 --> 39:44.888
YOU'RE NOT LIKE YOUR DAD.

39:44.930 --> 39:46.750
HONEY,
YOU ARE NOTHING LIKE YOUR DAD.

39:46.790 --> 39:48.826
OKAY?

39:51.250 --> 39:53.935
I JUST, I--

39:53.970 --> 39:56.689
I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE
TO TELL ME EVERYTHING, OKAY?

39:56.730 --> 40:00.006
ALWAYS,
EVEN IF IT'S NOT PRETTY AND...

40:03.020 --> 40:04.908
OKAY, SLUGGO?
[laughs]

40:04.950 --> 40:06.349
YOU HIT HIM.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.868
I'M NOT LAUGHING,
BUT IT'S JUST...

40:08.920 --> 40:11.388
BABE...WE HAVE TO FIND
SOME WAYS

40:11.440 --> 40:13.328
FOR YOU TO GET RID OF
THIS STRESS.

40:13.370 --> 40:14.291
IT'S NOT GOOD.

40:14.340 --> 40:16.683
- MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE UP
RACQUETBALL. HMM?

40:16.720 --> 40:17.709
- UH-UH.

40:17.760 --> 40:19.330
- OH, YOU HAVE
SOMETHING IN MIND?

40:19.380 --> 40:20.540
- MM-HMM.

40:23.450 --> 40:25.554
- MMM.

40:25.590 --> 40:26.375
- I JUST WANT YOU
TO PROMISE ME

40:26.420 --> 40:28.695
THAT YOU WON'T SAY
THAT YOU'RE...

40:28.730 --> 40:30.482
YOU'RE TURNING INTO
OR YOU'RE LIKE--

40:30.530 --> 40:35.285
- WHAT, MY DAD?
- YEAH. JUST--I DON'T KNOW.

40:35.320 --> 40:36.048
- ZEEK BRAVERMAN.
- OH!

40:36.080 --> 40:37.149
- HOW YOU DOIN'?
- OH, NO, SEE.

40:37.190 --> 40:38.145
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
- [as Zeek] NOW, KRISTINA,

40:38.190 --> 40:40.841
HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU
ABOUT R&R IN BANGKOK?

40:40.880 --> 40:42.461
- NO. THAT IS FREAKY,
AND IT'S NOT SEXY.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.639
I'M NOT LISTENING TO YOU.
- I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT

40:44.680 --> 40:46.602
STRESS AND TENSION--
I BEEN OUT ON THE FRONT LINES.

40:46.650 --> 40:48.049
- STOP IT! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- OKAY?

40:48.100 --> 40:49.818
HEY...

40:49.860 --> 40:53.569
- I LOVE YOU.

40:53.620 --> 40:56.134

[kiss]

40:56.170 --> 40:58.582
I'D RIDE HIM ON MY BOAT

40:58.620 --> 41:01.248
AND WE COULD
ALL TOGETHER

41:01.280 --> 41:03.521
GO OUT ON THE OCEAN

41:03.560 --> 41:07.690

ON MY BOAT

41:10.500 --> 41:12.013
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' HERE?

41:12.050 --> 41:13.426
- I JUST WANNA TELL YOU

41:13.470 --> 41:15.426
THAT I KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS BOAT MEANS TO YOU,

41:15.470 --> 41:19.054
AND...I WANNA HONOR THAT.

41:19.090 --> 41:20.364
POP!

41:20.400 --> 41:22.027

41:22.060 --> 41:25.541
I WANNA SEND IT OFF
THE RIGHT WAY.

41:30.410 --> 41:33.823
- OH, MY GOD!

41:40.150 --> 41:42.937
- OH, MY GOD...

41:42.980 --> 41:45.494

LIKE LIGHTNING

41:45.530 --> 41:47.976
I WOULDN'T NEED
NO SNEAKERS

41:48.020 --> 41:52.639
WELL, I'D COME AND GO
WHENEVER I WOULD PLEASE

41:52.680 --> 41:55.956
AND I'D SCARE 'EM
BY THE SHADE TREE

41:55.990 --> 41:58.470
AND SCARE 'EM
BY THE LIGHT POLE

41:58.510 --> 42:00.717
BUT I WOULD NOT SCARE
MY PONY

42:00.750 --> 42:04.163
ON MY BOAT
OUT ON THE SEA

42:04.210 --> 42:06.519
AND IF I HAD A BOAT

42:06.550 --> 42:09.303
I'D GO OUT ON THE OCEAN

42:09.350 --> 42:11.693
AND IF I HAD A PONY

42:11.730 --> 42:14.290
I'D RIDE HIM ON MY BOAT

42:14.320 --> 42:16.868
