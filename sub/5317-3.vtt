WEBVTT

00:02.915 --> 00:04.184
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

00:04.217 --> 00:06.219
What's wrong?

00:06.252 --> 00:08.188
Oh... never mind.

00:08.221 --> 00:09.989
I thought
Lena Dunham's dog died.

00:10.022 --> 00:11.991
Whew!

00:12.024 --> 00:13.793
It's just my aunt's.

00:16.229 --> 00:17.530
Whoa.

00:17.563 --> 00:19.199
Heather's pregnant.

00:19.232 --> 00:21.701
Who? Heather, she's pregnant.

00:21.734 --> 00:23.836
Ha-ha.

00:23.869 --> 00:25.371
Holy shit. Who's Heather?

00:25.405 --> 00:26.839
Heather.

00:26.872 --> 00:28.617
Yeah, I understand it's
a name commonly given

00:28.641 --> 00:30.410
to human women in the '80s,

00:30.443 --> 00:32.244
but I have no idea
who Heather is.

00:32.278 --> 00:33.213
Heather.

00:33.246 --> 00:35.115
Oh, my God.

00:35.148 --> 00:36.949
Ow! How do you not
know who Heather is?

00:36.982 --> 00:40.253
Heather of "Heather, Gretchen,
Bernadette, Justine, and Cory."

00:40.286 --> 00:42.722
My main crew, my girls.

00:42.755 --> 00:44.857
I've never heard of
any of these people.

00:44.890 --> 00:46.202
Heather used to work
with Justine.

00:46.226 --> 00:48.528
But not Tattoo Justine,
Ecstasy Justine.

00:48.561 --> 00:50.072
And Bernadette used to date
Rose's boyfriend

00:50.096 --> 00:51.407
when they were
in that band together,

00:51.431 --> 00:53.533
and then she started
dating Rose.

00:53.566 --> 00:54.876
And Cory was
the bartender at Pistol

00:54.900 --> 00:56.569
where we used to drink
all the time

00:56.602 --> 00:58.614
because they had great trance
night and even better cocaine.

00:58.638 --> 01:02.708
I've literally never heard any
of those words from you before.

01:02.742 --> 01:04.310
Except cocaine.

01:04.343 --> 01:06.045
I can't believe
she's pregnant again.

01:06.078 --> 01:07.580
What a dummy.

01:07.613 --> 01:10.583
I wonder how much abobos
even cost these days.

01:11.651 --> 01:12.885
I should offer to go with her.

01:12.918 --> 01:14.920
We could get
post-abobo mani-pedis.

01:14.954 --> 01:18.124
Oh, Gretchen, you don't need
to pretend you have friends.

01:18.158 --> 01:20.226
What? I have friends.

01:20.260 --> 01:22.462
No, there's nothing wrong
with not having friends.

01:23.463 --> 01:24.430
I don't.

01:24.464 --> 01:25.665
You don't have any friends?

01:25.698 --> 01:28.100
Nope, friends are for babies.

01:28.134 --> 01:30.570
Even my grandma has
tons of friends.

01:30.603 --> 01:32.614
You never outgrow the need
to feel connected to people.

01:32.638 --> 01:34.174
Nah, not me.

01:34.207 --> 01:35.808
So if you're so close,

01:35.841 --> 01:37.777
why haven't I met any
of these "girls"?

01:37.810 --> 01:39.812
I haven't seen 'em
in a couple months.

01:39.845 --> 01:41.281
Been super busy.

01:41.314 --> 01:43.483
Yeah, with my dick.

01:43.516 --> 01:46.519
Sorry, I've been doing
a lot of online gaming.

01:46.552 --> 01:48.854
I'm in a war with this
autistic kid from Sweden

01:48.888 --> 01:50.323
who keeps blocking
me on Instagram.

01:50.356 --> 01:51.757
Oh, you're on Instagram?

01:51.791 --> 01:54.294
Yeah, mostly I just
use it to stalk Vernon.

01:54.327 --> 01:56.162
His photos are tragic.

01:56.196 --> 01:57.497
Ooh, I want to see.

01:58.498 --> 02:01.267
Did he get a selfie stick?

02:01.301 --> 02:03.035
What the...?

02:03.068 --> 02:05.305
What did you just do?
I accidentally liked his photo.

02:05.338 --> 02:07.139
Oh, quick, uh, unlike it.

02:07.173 --> 02:08.308
Goddamn it, woman!

02:08.341 --> 02:09.675
I did it really fast.

02:09.709 --> 02:11.211
I'm sure he didn't even notice.

02:11.244 --> 02:13.313
Oh, my God!

02:13.346 --> 02:15.147
Finally happened!

02:17.049 --> 02:18.451
Sorry about that.

02:18.484 --> 02:22.522
Yeah, so... turns out,
you're gonna lose the leg.

02:23.523 --> 02:25.358
Yes.

02:43.108 --> 02:45.545
You're so lucky
you live near water.

02:45.578 --> 02:47.247
You live half a mile
from the ocean.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.849
Ugh, seagulls, sand dollars.

02:49.882 --> 02:52.652
Fat people in blankets
drinking orange soda.

02:52.685 --> 02:54.887
No thanks, ocean.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.089
Ooh, another dick pic.

02:57.122 --> 02:59.259
And... forwarded.

02:59.292 --> 03:01.361
Online dating is so fun.

03:01.394 --> 03:02.862
Who are you forwarding them to?

03:02.895 --> 03:05.197
This gay porn site pays
me ten bucks a dick.

03:05.231 --> 03:07.367
I have a job.

03:09.369 --> 03:10.603
Look.

03:10.636 --> 03:12.838
Ew, whose pee stick is that?

03:12.872 --> 03:15.174
Heather, she got herself
knocked up again.

03:15.207 --> 03:16.718
You know, "Heather,
Bernadette, Justine, Cory."

03:16.742 --> 03:18.544
Oh, yeah.

03:18.578 --> 03:21.013
I haven't seen those
basic hos in a minute.

03:21.046 --> 03:22.758
Probably 'cause you went
into hiding on the west side

03:22.782 --> 03:24.517
where no cool girls deign to go.

03:24.550 --> 03:28.120
Well, I'm back in the real world
and crushing this dick pic game.

03:28.153 --> 03:29.555
Well, I'm glad.

03:29.589 --> 03:30.899
I was a little worried
about you after Paul left.

03:30.923 --> 03:32.525
I'm not gonna lie.

03:32.558 --> 03:34.594
It's hard when you reach
over in the morning

03:34.627 --> 03:36.095
and there's no one there

03:36.128 --> 03:37.573
except for the sandwich
you fell asleep eating.

03:37.597 --> 03:39.599
You need closure from that nerd.

03:40.833 --> 03:42.868
You know what?
I'm gonna have a party.

03:42.902 --> 03:45.605
Mmm. Reconnect with my girls, throw
down old-school like we used to.

03:45.638 --> 03:47.607
I've been looking
to rub Paul's face

03:47.640 --> 03:49.909
in how dope I look and
how fun my life is.

03:49.942 --> 03:51.811
Inviting him to a get-together

03:51.844 --> 03:54.122
where I'm smooching some Tinder
rando is a perfect way to do it.

03:54.146 --> 03:56.115
It's not a "get-together,"
it's a party.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.750
My girls don't do
"get-togethers."

03:57.783 --> 03:59.051
Par-tay.

03:59.084 --> 04:01.120
Par-tay...

04:04.189 --> 04:06.125
Excuse me!

04:06.158 --> 04:07.960
You dropped something!

04:09.329 --> 04:11.130
No, it's more to the left.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.636
I really think

04:16.668 --> 04:18.971
Lindsay is beginning to
consider me, you know?

04:19.004 --> 04:20.339
Sexually. Ugh.

04:20.373 --> 04:22.342
I was wondering
if I should make a move.

04:22.375 --> 04:24.610
That's a terrible idea.

04:24.644 --> 04:26.955
That's exactly what I thought,
because she's still married.

04:26.979 --> 04:28.814
That's not what I meant.

04:28.848 --> 04:30.816
I mean, I come
from a family of honor.

04:31.884 --> 04:33.261
Well, directly,
I come from a family

04:33.285 --> 04:35.020
of home invaders,
identity thieves

04:35.054 --> 04:37.299
and, in my Uncle Xavier's case,
the butt-stabber of San Pasqual.

04:37.323 --> 04:40.326
But my lineage is one of honor,

04:40.360 --> 04:43.329
and so to clean
the deck ethically,

04:43.363 --> 04:46.098
I'm gonna ask Paul for
permission to pursue his wife.

04:46.131 --> 04:48.133
Please videotape that exchange.

04:48.167 --> 04:51.471
That way, I'll be free
to put the moves on Lindsay

04:51.504 --> 04:53.473
at our party.

04:53.506 --> 04:54.774
What party?

04:54.807 --> 04:56.385
Gretchen's throwing
a party for her girls.

04:56.409 --> 04:58.978
I never agreed to a party.

04:59.011 --> 04:59.979
We proxy-voted you.

05:00.012 --> 05:01.547
You lost two-to-one.

05:01.581 --> 05:03.983
Wait, if you didn't know
about the party,

05:04.016 --> 05:06.486
why'd you think we bought
all this alcohol?

05:06.519 --> 05:09.021
Oh, great, now I have to go
back to the store for my stuff.

05:13.192 --> 05:14.360
Be strong, be straight,

05:14.394 --> 05:15.828
be firm, be confident.

05:15.861 --> 05:17.997
Be strong, be straight,
be firm, be confident.

05:18.030 --> 05:20.666
Edgar.

05:20.700 --> 05:23.536
How nice of you to visit
my little backyard Shangri-la.

05:25.204 --> 05:26.739
Wh-Whose house is this?

05:26.772 --> 05:28.708
My biking buddy Connor.

05:28.741 --> 05:30.710
His wife Mimi died recently,

05:30.743 --> 05:32.712
and I wanted to make sure
he wasn't alone.

05:32.745 --> 05:34.013
What happened?

05:34.046 --> 05:35.915
Recumbent bikes have
many good qualities,

05:35.948 --> 05:38.150
but they're sometimes
hard to see from up high.

05:38.183 --> 05:40.252
Oh, no.

05:40.285 --> 05:42.187
The driver of the semi
never knew she was there.

05:42.221 --> 05:44.189
Poor thing was
dragged three miles.

05:44.223 --> 05:47.527
You've never seen
Connor pedal so fast.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.195
He kept motioning frantically
for the truck to stop,

05:50.229 --> 05:52.364
but the driver thought
he wanted him to honk.

05:52.398 --> 05:55.868
She was actually alive until
the semi got on the freeway.

05:55.901 --> 05:57.413
Well, that's the most
terrible story...

05:57.437 --> 06:00.105
Sad thing is, Mimi didn't want
to go out that day

06:00.139 --> 06:03.543
because her safety flag had been
stolen outside the junior high.

06:03.576 --> 06:06.211
But Connor told her they could
stop at the bike store

06:06.245 --> 06:08.514
after they raced
to Starbucks for tea.

06:08.548 --> 06:10.282
Uh, please give my
condolences to Con...

06:10.315 --> 06:14.286
The really sad thing is that
Connor wanted to let Mimi win

06:14.319 --> 06:16.956
because her impetigo
had been flaring up again.

06:16.989 --> 06:18.767
That's the only reason she
reached the intersection first.

06:18.791 --> 06:20.760
I don't need to hear every...

06:20.793 --> 06:24.363
The extra sad thing is, the
whole time she was being dragged

06:24.396 --> 06:27.199
towards the onramp,
she was texting Connor.

06:27.232 --> 06:29.535
Her phone still accessible
in its holder

06:29.569 --> 06:31.070
on the handlebars, you see?

06:31.103 --> 06:33.739
I saw the texts.

06:33.773 --> 06:35.307
They're quite chilling.

06:38.077 --> 06:39.945
You had something
you wanted to talk about?

06:39.979 --> 06:42.848
Yeah, I have to be
up front with you.

06:44.183 --> 06:45.384
I'm gonna go after your woman.

06:45.417 --> 06:46.719
Please don't go after Amy.

06:46.752 --> 06:48.721
Oh, uh, no.

06:48.754 --> 06:49.922
Lindsay.

06:49.955 --> 06:51.557
Oh.

06:51.591 --> 06:54.894
Well... I'm actually glad
to hear she's moving on.

06:54.927 --> 06:57.763
Now I can move Amy
out of the Days Inn.

06:57.797 --> 06:58.764
Then it's a win-win.

06:58.798 --> 07:00.733
Few of those in this world.

07:05.771 --> 07:08.608
Tea time's always
hardest for Connor.

07:33.833 --> 07:36.502
My date tonight is
everything Paul isn't.

07:36.536 --> 07:38.604
He's tall, he's thin, he's dumb.

07:38.638 --> 07:40.139
Look.

07:40.906 --> 07:42.041
And he's fun, too.

07:42.074 --> 07:44.209
He spells "titties" with a "Z."

07:44.243 --> 07:45.545
You're so getting murdered.

07:45.578 --> 07:47.079
I know.

07:52.685 --> 07:53.986
Hello.

07:54.019 --> 07:55.287
Um, excuse me.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.022
Excu...

07:57.056 --> 07:58.190
Hello.

07:59.892 --> 08:01.561
Can you read?

08:16.676 --> 08:19.178
Why is Killian bartending?

08:19.211 --> 08:21.681
Oh, while I was unloading
the car, he snuck up on me

08:21.714 --> 08:23.382
and said that things were scary

08:23.415 --> 08:25.026
because his parents were
taking some time apart.

08:25.050 --> 08:27.820
Then he asked if we
were having a party.

08:27.853 --> 08:29.321
He caught me at a weak moment.

08:29.354 --> 08:31.090
So you put him to work?

08:31.123 --> 08:32.758
What?

08:32.792 --> 08:35.861
I'm supposed to just let him
mingle at an adult gathering?

08:35.895 --> 08:37.261
Good point.

08:37.296 --> 08:39.664
I am so stoked for you
to meet my girls!

08:39.698 --> 08:41.500
Ugh. They're super hard-core.

08:41.533 --> 08:43.102
Bernadette is such a lush.

08:43.135 --> 08:45.170
And no shit,
I wouldn't be surprised

08:45.204 --> 08:46.281
if Justine tried to blow you.

08:46.305 --> 08:47.515
She bangs everyone's boyfriends.

08:47.539 --> 08:49.508
Then she's super
apologetic about it.

08:49.541 --> 08:51.243
This party's gonna be so dope.

08:51.276 --> 08:53.112
I thought it was a get-together.

08:53.145 --> 08:55.981
We have a bartender.

09:00.385 --> 09:01.754
Oh, no.

09:01.787 --> 09:04.056
Gretchen, I've been catfished.

09:04.089 --> 09:06.091
Oh, buddy.

09:06.125 --> 09:07.793
He's actually a
nine-year-old boy.

09:07.827 --> 09:09.470
His stepmom caught him sexting
with some other skank,

09:09.494 --> 09:10.896
and she wrote to me.

09:10.930 --> 09:13.398
No wonder he didn't know
how to spell titties.

09:13.432 --> 09:14.967
What am I gonna do now?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.903
Paul is coming; I'm gonna
look like such a loser.

09:17.937 --> 09:19.371
How old are you?

09:19.404 --> 09:21.974
Sorry, ma'am, I'm working.

09:22.007 --> 09:23.408
They're here.

09:23.442 --> 09:24.543
Bitches!

09:24.576 --> 09:25.310
Oh.

09:25.344 --> 09:27.312
Shh...

09:27.346 --> 09:30.716
Whoa, did you bring
your own pony keg to the party?

09:30.750 --> 09:31.651
You drunk.

09:31.684 --> 09:32.718
It's a baby.

09:32.752 --> 09:34.586
Oh, why do you have a baby?

09:34.620 --> 09:36.288
Because I had a baby.

09:36.321 --> 09:38.290
Oh.

09:38.323 --> 09:40.259
Okay.

09:40.292 --> 09:42.061
You're not still pregnant,
are you?

09:42.094 --> 09:43.763
I think so.

09:43.796 --> 09:44.897
Ew, I'm sorry.

09:44.930 --> 09:46.331
I hate that.

09:46.365 --> 09:47.508
I mean, if you're willing
to drive to Whittier,

09:47.532 --> 09:48.910
there's this place
you can just walk in.

09:48.934 --> 09:50.311
It's right near
a Marie Callender's.

09:50.335 --> 09:51.403
We can make a day of it.

09:51.436 --> 09:52.972
What are you drinking? I'm not.

09:53.005 --> 09:54.485
I mean, if you're
getting rid of it...

09:55.808 --> 09:57.677
Oh...

09:57.710 --> 09:58.844
Huh.

09:59.779 --> 10:01.346
Where's Cory?

10:01.380 --> 10:04.650
She hit a bit of a rough patch.

10:04.684 --> 10:06.318
What's going on?

10:06.351 --> 10:07.863
We're "Heather, Gretchen,
Bernadette, Justine and Cory."

10:07.887 --> 10:11.290
None of us have actually had
much time to hang in a while,

10:11.323 --> 10:14.426
so this is like
a mini-reunion for us, too.

10:14.459 --> 10:16.128
Okay.

10:16.161 --> 10:17.596
Well...

10:17.629 --> 10:19.598
please tell me you're still
a total alcoholic.

10:19.631 --> 10:20.666
Of course.

10:20.700 --> 10:23.368
Thank God. I do. Every day.

10:23.402 --> 10:24.870
Jesus Christ.

10:30.075 --> 10:31.276
Hey.

10:31.310 --> 10:32.611
We're out of chips.

10:32.644 --> 10:34.313
Uh...

10:34.346 --> 10:35.848
Listen, I've been thinking a lot

10:35.881 --> 10:37.316
about what happened
the other night.

10:37.349 --> 10:39.785
What happened? Well,
I know that I was

10:39.819 --> 10:42.054
"taking photos" of you
for "dating purposes"

10:42.087 --> 10:43.655
with "guys who have
a lot of money"

10:43.689 --> 10:45.224
and/or giant hogs..."

10:45.257 --> 10:46.726
You memorized my profile.

10:46.759 --> 10:48.861
Look, Lindsay,

10:48.894 --> 10:50.896
I'm in a really good place
right now.

10:50.930 --> 10:52.397
I feel strong,

10:52.431 --> 10:54.199
and ever since
you got separated from...

10:54.233 --> 10:55.835
Paul. Right, Paul.

10:55.868 --> 10:57.903
So I... Hello, Lindsay.

10:57.937 --> 10:59.138
Edgar.

10:59.171 --> 11:01.073
Hey... Hello, Paul.

11:01.106 --> 11:03.142
Look, Lindsay,

11:03.175 --> 11:06.345
we didn't want to ambush you,
but, uh...

11:06.378 --> 11:07.913
What the farts?

11:07.947 --> 11:09.481
Hi, Lindsay.

11:09.514 --> 11:11.851
Listen, I'd never
want to make you feel

11:11.884 --> 11:14.153
uncomfortable at your own party.

11:14.186 --> 11:15.721
Paul told me you'd
be okay with this,

11:15.755 --> 11:18.190
but eek, you know?

11:18.223 --> 11:20.893
I'd feel better if I heard it
from the ol' horse's mouth.

11:20.926 --> 11:22.361
Are you calling me an old horse?

11:22.394 --> 11:25.230
And scout's honor,
if you want us to skedaddle,

11:25.264 --> 11:27.933
well, we'll get skedaddlin'.

11:30.635 --> 11:32.204
Well...

11:32.237 --> 11:35.007
it might have been
a little weird, but...

11:35.040 --> 11:37.609
ever since...

11:37.642 --> 11:39.378
this happened,

11:39.411 --> 11:42.381
any jealous bone
has left my body.

11:42.414 --> 11:44.249
Old bone out, new bone in.

11:44.283 --> 11:46.118
Okay. Phew.

11:46.151 --> 11:48.253
I'm Amy Cadingle.

11:48.287 --> 11:49.789
Edgar Quintero.

11:49.822 --> 11:51.290
Lindsay's honey. Mm-hmm.

11:51.323 --> 11:52.724
Edgar.

11:52.758 --> 11:54.860
F.T.W.

11:54.894 --> 11:56.095
That means "for the win."

12:07.506 --> 12:08.607
Hey!

12:08.640 --> 12:10.309
There you are.
I got your message

12:10.342 --> 12:11.944
on my 'Gram.

12:11.977 --> 12:12.912
Received loud and clear.

12:12.945 --> 12:14.379
Oh, goddamn it, Gretchen.

12:14.413 --> 12:15.815
I don't know what it is

12:15.848 --> 12:17.950
about us that our relaish
keeps going south.

12:17.983 --> 12:19.484
Maybe we just have
too much in common.

12:19.518 --> 12:20.820
We have nothing in common.

12:20.853 --> 12:22.721
We're like Hall & Oates.

12:22.754 --> 12:24.056
There's clearly

12:24.089 --> 12:25.791
frisson between them, you know?

12:25.825 --> 12:29.461
And maybe it's the electricity
of two alphas

12:29.494 --> 12:32.798
that's caused them to churn out
the finest catalog of hits

12:32.832 --> 12:33.966
in pop history.

12:33.999 --> 12:37.136
So let's get past
all this nonsense

12:37.169 --> 12:38.737
and make our
"Method of Modern Love."

12:38.770 --> 12:41.340
That isn't even
one of their better songs.

12:41.373 --> 12:44.309
You're right.

12:44.343 --> 12:46.478
It's their best song.

12:46.511 --> 12:48.247
We have a great rapport.

12:48.280 --> 12:49.514
You should do my podcast.

12:50.549 --> 12:51.750
Jimmy!

12:51.783 --> 12:53.618
Great party!

12:53.652 --> 12:55.420
I have a girlfriend.

12:58.190 --> 12:59.992
It wasn't really my intention

13:00.025 --> 13:01.593
to get into education,

13:01.626 --> 13:03.863
but when I substituted
that first day,

13:03.896 --> 13:06.131
it just kind of... clicked.

13:07.399 --> 13:09.334
Remember when you had
that birthday party

13:09.368 --> 13:10.836
and we locked you
in your bedroom

13:10.870 --> 13:12.938
'cause you were yelling
at your guests

13:12.972 --> 13:14.212
and threatening suicide by cop?

13:14.239 --> 13:15.807
Mmm. Unfortunately.

13:15.841 --> 13:17.442
And then you climbed
out the fire escape

13:17.476 --> 13:18.878
and came back in the front

13:18.911 --> 13:20.345
and yelled,
"I'm back, cocksuckers!"

13:21.914 --> 13:23.282
That was hilarious!

13:23.315 --> 13:24.516
That was mortifying,

13:24.549 --> 13:26.551
actually. It's a great story.

13:26.585 --> 13:29.221
I have enough of those
to last a lifetime.

13:29.254 --> 13:30.890
Yeah.

13:30.923 --> 13:32.524
Well.

13:32.557 --> 13:34.726
Seriously, thanks for inviting
us to your get-together.

13:34.759 --> 13:37.963
Party. It seems more
like a get-together.

13:37.997 --> 13:39.531
It's a goddamn party...

13:39.564 --> 13:40.799
Okay, Gretchen.

13:40.832 --> 13:42.234
Oh, my God. Look.

13:43.936 --> 13:45.137
Cory!

13:45.170 --> 13:47.072
Thank God you're here.

13:47.106 --> 13:48.073
How are you?

13:48.107 --> 13:50.075
Need A Drink status.

13:52.611 --> 13:53.678
Ah. That's better.

13:57.749 --> 13:58.750
'Sup?

13:58.783 --> 13:59.584
Hi, Cor.

13:59.618 --> 14:00.585
Mm-hmm.

14:00.619 --> 14:01.720
What's that?

14:01.753 --> 14:03.255
It's my baby.

14:03.288 --> 14:05.057
Gross.

14:07.426 --> 14:09.194
And I'm gonna go over here.

14:09.228 --> 14:10.729
Nice to see you, Cory.

14:11.796 --> 14:13.398
Cor, I'm pregnant.
Could you not...

14:13.432 --> 14:14.733
Not smoke at a party?

14:14.766 --> 14:16.936
No, I cannot
not smoke at a party.

14:16.969 --> 14:19.905
Can you not bring your
unborn tummy worm to a party?

14:19.939 --> 14:21.606
Gretchen invited us,

14:21.640 --> 14:22.841
offspring and all.

14:22.874 --> 14:24.019
I didn't actually invite babies,

14:24.043 --> 14:26.045
per se. Mega-burn.

14:26.078 --> 14:28.780
Okay. Well, I guess
I'm going over there, too.

14:31.650 --> 14:33.385
I mean...

14:38.723 --> 14:41.193
I am so glad you're here.

14:41.226 --> 14:43.528
They are so different,
it's insane.

14:43.562 --> 14:45.230
Could I have one of those?

14:45.264 --> 14:46.765
A dollar.

14:46.798 --> 14:47.799
Ha.

14:47.832 --> 14:48.800
Are you serious?

14:48.833 --> 14:50.735
Shit yeah. It's 2015, bitch,

14:50.769 --> 14:52.938
and EBT ain't even trying
to let me buy smokes anymore.

14:52.972 --> 14:54.273
Never mind.

14:54.306 --> 14:56.075
So what was that all about?

14:56.108 --> 14:58.710
Heather thinks
I stole her stereo,

14:58.743 --> 14:59.979
suspicious-ass bitch.

15:00.012 --> 15:01.746
Oh, my God, that's crazy.
I know.

15:01.780 --> 15:02.881
I just borrowed it.

15:02.914 --> 15:03.925
I was totally gonna get it

15:03.949 --> 15:05.150
back from the pawnshop

15:05.184 --> 15:06.285
and then she got all aggro,

15:06.318 --> 15:07.552
and I was like, screw that.

15:07.586 --> 15:08.920
That no-trusting-ass bitch.

15:08.954 --> 15:10.322
Just on principle.

15:10.355 --> 15:11.723
Plus, I had this dog

15:11.756 --> 15:13.234
and it bit this kid in the face
and that was

15:13.258 --> 15:14.335
a whole thing, so it's not like

15:14.359 --> 15:16.295
I wasn't gonna get high.

15:16.328 --> 15:17.829
Yeah. Totally.

15:17.862 --> 15:19.164
So whose house is this?

15:19.198 --> 15:20.432
Mine.

15:20.465 --> 15:22.134
Oh.

15:23.335 --> 15:24.636
All right, now tell me whose nut

15:24.669 --> 15:26.238
I should suck on.

15:26.271 --> 15:28.271
I got kicked out of the shelter
again for fighting.

15:29.975 --> 15:33.245
The amazing thing
about 3D puzzles

15:33.278 --> 15:35.480
is that they force you

15:35.514 --> 15:38.583
to use multiple axes
of your cerebral cortex.

15:39.551 --> 15:41.420
Me habla puzzles.

15:41.453 --> 15:43.355
Right?

15:46.858 --> 15:48.093
Ooh, boy.

15:48.127 --> 15:49.594
According to my
life-logging app,

15:49.628 --> 15:50.838
I haven't consumed
this much alcohol

15:50.862 --> 15:53.265
since after Mimi's funeral.

15:53.298 --> 15:54.699
Don't worry.

15:54.733 --> 15:57.936
I shall "boot and rally."

16:00.372 --> 16:01.640
Hate that dork.

16:01.673 --> 16:03.442
Why's he got to ruin puzzles

16:03.475 --> 16:04.643
with a third "D"?

16:04.676 --> 16:06.211
Want to game it up?

16:08.047 --> 16:09.848
Sure.

16:10.915 --> 16:11.959
People think
Joss Whedon sold out

16:11.983 --> 16:13.052
when he did The Avengers,

16:13.085 --> 16:14.653
but that's like saying

16:14.686 --> 16:16.197
Hugh Howey should have
never expanded Wool

16:16.221 --> 16:18.557
from a Kindle Single
to a full novel.

16:18.590 --> 16:21.026
"8:23 p.m. Vomited.

16:21.060 --> 16:23.662
"Color: Off-white.

16:23.695 --> 16:25.330
Contents: Beer
comma hiking gorp."

16:25.364 --> 16:27.199
And there you are, honey.

16:29.268 --> 16:30.469
What's that?

16:30.502 --> 16:32.071
What are you doing
with your hands?

16:32.104 --> 16:33.572
Sorry. It's ASL.

16:33.605 --> 16:35.006
I work as an interpreter.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.475
My parents are both deaf.

16:36.508 --> 16:37.685
Sometimes I don't even notice
I'm doing it.

16:37.709 --> 16:38.910
I'm learning, too.

16:39.944 --> 16:41.280
He's a natural.

16:43.748 --> 16:45.517
Ah, somebody's slurring!

16:48.420 --> 16:50.255
Hey, Gretchen, thanks again,

16:50.289 --> 16:52.257
but it's kind of late for us.

16:52.291 --> 16:53.492
Don't leave.

16:53.525 --> 16:54.826
I-I'm sorry.

16:54.859 --> 16:56.003
I know it's been,
like, almost a year

16:56.027 --> 16:57.262
since I last reached out.

16:57.296 --> 16:58.663
It's been over three years.

16:58.697 --> 17:00.099
It has?

17:00.132 --> 17:01.400
Really?

17:01.433 --> 17:02.367
It's okay.

17:02.401 --> 17:03.502
You know, things change.

17:03.535 --> 17:05.337
That's God's business, not ours.

17:05.369 --> 17:06.871
Come on.

17:06.905 --> 17:08.683
Let's go out some night soon,
just the four of us.

17:08.707 --> 17:09.708
Really catch up.

17:09.741 --> 17:11.242
You can get a babysitter.

17:11.276 --> 17:13.244
Dump the kid,
we can party like we used to.

17:13.278 --> 17:15.614
The thing is, Gretchen,
I don't want to dump the kid.

17:15.646 --> 17:17.182
You'll understand someday.

17:17.215 --> 17:19.483
Bye, sweetheart.

17:31.663 --> 17:35.200
Hey, I made more mashed
potato savory cupcakes.

17:35.234 --> 17:36.801
I'm not hungry.

17:38.170 --> 17:39.804
Edgar, I'm sorry.

17:39.838 --> 17:42.307
For what?

17:42.341 --> 17:44.943
For using you to try
to make Paul jealous.

17:44.976 --> 17:46.745
Amy's great.

17:46.778 --> 17:48.413
Crazy boring

17:48.447 --> 17:51.983
and, yeah, she has that thing
with her eye, but...

17:52.016 --> 17:53.718
she's nice.

17:53.752 --> 17:56.221
And you're nice.

17:56.255 --> 17:59.124
And Paul is nice and I'm...

17:59.158 --> 18:01.160
well... not.

18:01.193 --> 18:02.994
I think you're great...

18:03.027 --> 18:04.829
No, I'm materialistic.

18:04.863 --> 18:07.466
I'm incapable of being alone.

18:07.499 --> 18:10.269
I never really learned
how to shower that good.

18:10.302 --> 18:12.537
I almost always forget
to flush the toilet...

18:15.274 --> 18:17.008
What are you doing?

18:17.041 --> 18:18.109
Sorry.

18:18.143 --> 18:20.044
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.748
Good thinking.

18:23.782 --> 18:26.017
He's watching. Kiss me harder.

18:49.708 --> 18:51.710
Well, it's just like
I told Gretchen.

18:51.743 --> 18:52.811
Friends are for babies.

18:52.844 --> 18:54.346
And just because I fell in feces

18:54.379 --> 18:56.047
and all the kids called me

18:56.080 --> 18:57.958
"Shitty Jimmy," and I was
the smartest kid in my class,

18:57.982 --> 19:00.785
that has nothing to do
with why I don't need friends.

19:00.819 --> 19:02.321
Jimmy, I want
to tell you something.

19:02.354 --> 19:03.722
I was born dead.

19:05.056 --> 19:06.024
Sorry, what?

19:06.057 --> 19:07.492
No pulse.

19:07.526 --> 19:08.560
Totally blue.

19:08.593 --> 19:10.995
I died for, like, 15 minutes.

19:11.029 --> 19:12.531
Then...

19:12.564 --> 19:13.865
bam!

19:13.898 --> 19:15.166
Alive.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.311
You should've seen
the priest's face.

19:16.335 --> 19:17.336
If I could change

19:17.369 --> 19:19.571
just one thing about myself,

19:19.604 --> 19:21.306
it'd be that I was born alive.

19:21.340 --> 19:23.408
But you know what I realized?

19:23.442 --> 19:26.545
When it comes down to it,
we're all born dead.

19:26.578 --> 19:28.347
It's only through other people,

19:28.380 --> 19:30.649
through friends,
that we become alive.

19:30.682 --> 19:33.785
Not a last-second mucus vacuum.

19:35.254 --> 19:36.988
Thanks, man.

19:37.021 --> 19:39.023
I love you so much.

19:39.057 --> 19:39.858
Get out.

19:39.891 --> 19:41.025
I know it makes

19:41.059 --> 19:42.561
a lot of people uncomfortable,

19:42.594 --> 19:44.272
but you'll see, I am just
like everybody else.

19:44.296 --> 19:45.830
Mmm. Oh.

19:45.864 --> 19:47.575
Thanks for letting me
come to your party, Jimmy.

19:47.599 --> 19:49.934
You're a really good friend.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.637
Oh, goddamn it.

19:55.807 --> 19:57.075
How'd it go with your girls?

19:57.108 --> 19:59.611
They're not my girls anymore.

19:59.644 --> 20:00.788
You were right.
Friends are dumb.

20:00.812 --> 20:01.913
I told you.

20:01.946 --> 20:05.284
Those basic hos are super basic.

20:05.317 --> 20:07.352
Ooh...

20:07.386 --> 20:08.720
That's nice.

20:08.753 --> 20:10.722
I didn't know
things had changed so much.

20:10.755 --> 20:13.091
I just want to go dancing
like we used to.

20:13.124 --> 20:15.193
Just one more time.

20:15.226 --> 20:16.194
No, thanks.

20:16.227 --> 20:17.462
I'll go dancing with you.

20:17.496 --> 20:19.063
You will? Okay!

20:19.097 --> 20:19.931
Let's go!

20:19.964 --> 20:21.366
Ooh...

20:21.400 --> 20:22.467
I mean...

20:22.501 --> 20:24.269
we have booze and music.

20:24.303 --> 20:25.437
We can just dance here.

20:25.470 --> 20:26.738
That sounds perfect.

20:26.771 --> 20:29.073
Oh, God.

20:30.942 --> 20:33.077
Hey. Where's the stereo?

20:38.650 --> 20:39.918
'Sup, short round?

20:39.951 --> 20:41.262
Want to buy a dope-ass
retro turntable?

20:41.286 --> 20:43.788
Comes with most of the wires.

20:43.822 --> 20:44.923
25 bills.

20:44.956 --> 20:46.066
I only made six dollars tonight.

20:46.090 --> 20:47.926
Simple-ass midget.

20:47.959 --> 20:50.862

A fantasy league
is like a family...

21:35.139 --> 21:36.475
Said no one ever.

21:36.508 --> 21:39.143
I have achieved more
than I ever thought possible...

21:39.177 --> 21:41.680
A checking account,
unlimited texting.

21:41.713 --> 21:44.616
Win or lose, it's how
you play your friends.

21:44.649 --> 21:48.052
Do I have any regrets?
Yeah. Tony Romo.

History is not written by the winners.
It's written by the cheaters.

21:51.990 --> 21:55.026
My mother always wondered,
how low can you go?

21:55.059 --> 21:56.628
Well, Mom, pretty low.

22:11.209 --> 22:13.445
Oh.

22:16.515 --> 22:19.150
Oh. Sorry.

22:21.185 --> 22:23.187
That wasn't your phone, was it?
