WEBVTT

00:01.380 --> 00:02.692
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.726 --> 00:04.349
RUSSELL:
NO MORE FIGHTING, CLARKE.

00:04.383 --> 00:08.422
BE AT PEACE, A BETTER PLACE,
JUST LIKE YOU SAID YOU WANTED.

00:08.456 --> 00:11.494
JOSEPHINE:
NOW, THIS I CAN WORK WITH.

00:11.528 --> 00:12.391
WHO ARE YOU?

00:12.426 --> 00:15.256
JOSEPHINE LIGHTBOURNE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:15.291 --> 00:16.326
YOU'RE NOT CLARKE.

00:16.361 --> 00:17.741
ABBY: THAT WOMAN'S
A MONSTER.

00:17.776 --> 00:19.226
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
LEE-LEE?

00:19.260 --> 00:21.124
YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE
YOUR BEST FRIEND?

00:21.159 --> 00:22.815
- JOSEPHINE?
- SURPRISE.

00:22.850 --> 00:25.577
YOURS WAS THE LAST FACE
I SAW BEFORE I FELL.

00:25.611 --> 00:26.647
NOW WE'RE EVEN.

00:26.681 --> 00:29.098
ECHO: BELLAMY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:29.132 --> 00:32.480
CLARKE'S DEAD.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.696
I BLAME YOU BECAUSE
MY FATHER'S DEAD,

00:41.731 --> 00:43.698
AND IT'S
MY MOTHER'S FAULT.

00:43.733 --> 00:45.252
- WHO ELSE?
- WELCOME BACK.

00:45.286 --> 00:47.633
I DON'T HAVE
TO PRETEND ANYMORE.

00:47.668 --> 00:49.256
AAH!

00:49.290 --> 00:50.809
THE TRUTH HURTS.

00:50.843 --> 00:54.606
THIS IS
THE ENERGY.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.711
I'M A COMMANDER.

00:56.746 --> 00:59.197
HOW MANY HAVE
TO DIE?

01:02.579 --> 01:04.443
I'M SORRY, LEXA.

01:04.478 --> 01:08.447
IF I WAS WITH BELLAMY,
I NEVER WOULD HAVE MET YOU.

01:14.902 --> 01:19.389
MAN: PRISONER 319,
FACE THE WALL.

01:29.261 --> 01:31.850
THEY'RE ALL
TAKING THEM.

01:31.884 --> 01:35.440
JAHA...

01:55.667 --> 01:57.289
HUH.

01:58.532 --> 02:00.154
DAD?

02:04.434 --> 02:06.436
HELLO, SWEETHEART.

02:06.471 --> 02:09.646
HUH...HUH.

02:14.444 --> 02:18.966
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?
HOW ARE WE HERE?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.832
WHAT'S THE LAST THING
YOU REMEMBER?

02:30.253 --> 02:32.738
I DIED.

02:33.222 --> 02:37.329
COME HERE A SECOND.
COME ON.

02:39.607 --> 02:43.163
NOW YOU REST.

02:43.991 --> 02:46.580
IT'S OVER.

02:46.614 --> 02:49.686
I'VE BEEN FIGHTING
FOR SO LONG.

02:49.721 --> 02:52.482
I KNOW YOU HAVE.

02:52.517 --> 02:56.176
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEE YOU AGAIN.

02:59.558 --> 03:02.837
I DIDN'T GET
TO SAY GOOD-BYE

03:02.872 --> 03:07.704
TO MADI, TO MOM.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.916
WHAT THE HELL?

03:15.885 --> 03:17.024
HUH.

03:17.058 --> 03:19.889
IT STARTED
WHEN I GOT UPSET.

03:19.923 --> 03:24.514
CLARKE, LISTEN.
WHAT DO YOU HEAR?

03:24.549 --> 03:27.276
- RAIN?
- HA! I'M SERIOUS.

03:27.310 --> 03:31.038
FOCUS. BETWEEN
THE RAINDROPS,

03:31.072 --> 03:33.040
WHAT ELSE
DO YOU HEAR?

03:36.630 --> 03:40.979
A HEARTBEAT.

03:43.809 --> 03:46.950
I'M STILL ALIVE.

03:46.985 --> 03:48.883
NO. NO.

03:48.918 --> 03:52.577
I SAW IT.
HE KILLED ME.

03:52.611 --> 03:54.579
DIDN'T.

03:56.028 --> 03:59.031
YOU'RE JUST
IN MY HEAD.

03:59.066 --> 04:01.758
I LOVED BEING HERE
WITH MADI,

04:01.793 --> 04:07.247
AND I LOVE YOU,
SO HERE YOU ARE.

04:07.937 --> 04:11.389
OH, SWEETHEART...

04:13.045 --> 04:15.772
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
AM I DREAMING?

04:15.807 --> 04:18.603
THIS PLACE IS
REACTING TO YOU,

04:18.637 --> 04:23.953
SO WE'RE JUST IN YOUR
SUBCONSCIOUS SOMEHOW,

04:23.987 --> 04:26.369
BUT BEYOND THAT,

04:26.404 --> 04:30.442
THERE ARE NO ANSWERS
FOR YOU HERE, CLARKE,

04:30.477 --> 04:32.789
SO GO ON.

04:32.824 --> 04:35.067
GO FIGURE THIS OUT.

04:35.102 --> 04:38.554
I'LL BE HERE
IF YOU NEED ME.

04:41.729 --> 04:44.076
I LOVE YOU, DAD.

04:44.111 --> 04:46.803
FOREVER.

04:46.838 --> 04:49.979
GO ON.

05:39.580 --> 05:42.445
SANCTUM
IS MINE!

05:42.480 --> 05:45.414
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

05:48.106 --> 05:50.936
IT IS REACTING TO ME.

06:03.501 --> 06:05.744
HELLO, CLARKE.

06:05.779 --> 06:06.883
NO.

06:06.918 --> 06:10.887
I PULLED THE KILL SWITCH.
I DESTROYED YOU.

06:10.922 --> 06:12.613
AND I SAVED YOU.

06:12.648 --> 06:15.029
WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE STILL HERE?

06:15.064 --> 06:17.031
I MAY BE GONE,

06:17.066 --> 06:18.895
BUT THIS PRECIOUS
DEPOSITORY

06:18.930 --> 06:21.450
OF YOUR MEMORIES
IS HERE

06:21.484 --> 06:23.037
BECAUSE OF ME.

06:23.072 --> 06:24.453
YOU'RE WELCOME.

06:24.487 --> 06:26.489
THE NEURAL MESH
IS STILL IN MY HEAD.

06:26.524 --> 06:28.008
IT MUST HAVE INTERFERED
WITH THE DRUG

06:28.042 --> 06:29.596
THEY USED
TO WIPE MY MIND.

06:29.630 --> 06:31.943
CORRECT,
AND SO, YOU SEE,

06:31.977 --> 06:35.498
YOU EXIST
BECAUSE OF ME,

06:35.533 --> 06:38.052
BUT YOU WON'T
IF THEY FIGURE OUT

06:38.087 --> 06:41.780
HOW YOU FREED RAVEN.

06:41.815 --> 06:44.058
WE EMP'D THE CHIP

06:44.093 --> 06:48.580
BUT ONLY IN RAVEN
AND MOM, NOT ME.

06:48.615 --> 06:52.653
- UH!
- AAH!

06:56.243 --> 07:00.523
IF I WERE YOU--
AND, IN A WAY, I AM--

07:00.558 --> 07:04.838
I'D KEEP
THIS MEMORY SAFE.

07:08.945 --> 07:11.051
THANK YOU, BUT
FOR THE RECORD,

07:11.085 --> 07:12.259
YOU TRIED TO STEAL

07:12.293 --> 07:14.088
ALL THOSE MEMORIES
YOU'RE NOW SAVING.

07:14.123 --> 07:16.919
I TRIED TO SPARE YOU
THE PAIN AND HORROR

07:16.953 --> 07:19.577
OF YOUR EXISTENCE.

07:19.611 --> 07:21.855
THERE IS NOT JOY
WITHOUT PAIN.

07:21.889 --> 07:24.513
I NEVER DID
UNDERSTAND HUMANS.

07:24.547 --> 07:27.516
THOSE PAINFUL MEMORIES
AREN'T EVEN HERE.

07:27.550 --> 07:29.932
THEY'RE CAST AWAY
DEEP IN YOUR MIND,

07:29.966 --> 07:33.107
WHERE YOU DON'T
HAVE TO FACE THEM,

07:33.142 --> 07:35.696
AND YET...

07:35.731 --> 07:37.698
YOU CAN'T
LET THEM GO.

07:37.733 --> 07:39.976
WAIT. YOU SAID THIS
IS A REPOSITORY

07:40.011 --> 07:41.564
- OF MY MEMORIES...
- YES.

07:41.599 --> 07:44.809
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
THERE I'VE NEVER SEEN.

07:44.843 --> 07:49.227
- SANCTUM IS MINE!
- COLLISION ALERT.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.858
WOMAN: AAH!

08:01.791 --> 08:05.519
CLARKE GRIFFIN.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:05.554 --> 08:07.590
I'VE HEARD
SO MANY THINGS,

08:07.625 --> 08:09.868
MOST OF THEM MURDERY,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

08:09.903 --> 08:11.560
NO JUDGMENT.

08:11.594 --> 08:13.596
- JOSEPHINE?
- IN THE FLESH,

08:13.631 --> 08:15.633
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE OPENED THAT DOOR.

08:15.667 --> 08:20.051
THIS BODY IS NOT BIG
ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US.

08:25.574 --> 08:28.611
RUSSELL REALLY DID IT.
HE STOLE MY BODY.

08:28.646 --> 08:31.338
AND CLEARLY MADE
A MESS OF IT.

08:31.372 --> 08:34.721
IT'S BEEN HUNDREDS OF YEARS
SINCE A MIND WIPE FAILED,

08:34.755 --> 08:37.068
BUT I GOT TO SAY,
THIS ISN'T BAD,

08:37.102 --> 08:39.760
NOT AS ORGANIZED AS
MY MINDSPACE, OF COURSE,

08:39.795 --> 08:43.108
BUT MILDLY IMPRESSIVE.

08:43.143 --> 08:44.834
MINDSPACE?

08:44.869 --> 08:46.595
THE BRAIN CREATES
THESE CONSTRUCTS

08:46.629 --> 08:47.906
WHEN TWO MINDS
SHARE A BODY,

08:47.941 --> 08:50.081
LIKE LUCID DREAMING
ONLY NOT AS FUN.

08:50.115 --> 08:52.048
IT'S A SELF-PRESERVATION
THING, TRYING TO KEEP

08:52.083 --> 08:55.017
THE MINDS SEPARATE SO
THE BODY DOESN'T DIE.

08:55.051 --> 08:58.054
YOU KIND OF MESSED THAT UP
WHEN YOU OPENED THE DOOR,

08:58.089 --> 08:59.193
SO, YOU KNOW, THANKS

08:59.228 --> 09:01.333
FOR THE ACCELERATED
BRAIN DETERIORATION.

09:01.368 --> 09:03.784
WAIT. YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS BEFORE?

09:03.819 --> 09:05.821
NEVER ANYTHING
AS ADVANCED AS THIS,

09:05.855 --> 09:07.650
BUT, YEAH,
BACK IN THE DAY

09:07.685 --> 09:09.894
BEFORE GABRIEL
PERFECTED THE MIND WIPE,

09:09.928 --> 09:11.378
THERE WERE
A FEW MISHAPS.

09:11.412 --> 09:13.138
I GOT JACKED
INTO SOME PEOPLE'S MINDS

09:13.173 --> 09:14.864
WHILE THE LIGHTS
WERE STILL ON.

09:14.899 --> 09:17.384
- THEY WERE SO AVERAGE.
- WHAT HAPPENED?

09:17.418 --> 09:19.351
THE FIRST WAS
A 6-MONTH-OLD.

09:19.386 --> 09:22.320
HER MIND WAS UNFORMED,
FULL OF CHAOS,

09:22.354 --> 09:23.942
SHAPES AND SOUNDS.

09:23.977 --> 09:25.668
THEN THERE
WAS SAVANNAH.

09:25.703 --> 09:29.189
I SWEAR I WAS NOT
THAT OBNOXIOUS AT 15.

09:29.223 --> 09:30.328
AND THEN THEY DIED.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.157
BRAIN HEMORRHAGING
LEADS TO STROKE,

09:32.192 --> 09:33.262
AND WE ALL FALL DOWN.

09:33.296 --> 09:36.817
IT'S MESSY AND HURTS
LIKE A MOTHER,

09:36.852 --> 09:38.198
WOULD NOT
RECOMMEND IT.

09:38.232 --> 09:42.064
TWO MINDS, ONE BRAIN
NEVER ENDS WELL,

09:42.098 --> 09:46.309
SO THIS,
IT'S A PROBLEM.

09:46.344 --> 09:48.380
HOW DID YOU
EVEN SURVIVE?

09:48.415 --> 09:49.865
YOU JUST WANT
TO KNOW SO YOU

09:49.899 --> 09:51.383
CAN FIGURE OUT HOW
TO GET RID OF ME.

09:51.418 --> 09:52.695
OK. WEREN'T YOU
LISTENING?

09:52.730 --> 09:55.008
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING,
THIS BODY DIES.

09:55.042 --> 09:56.768
- THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
- OF COURSE NOT.

09:56.803 --> 09:58.908
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
FIND A NEW BODY

09:58.943 --> 10:00.116
AND GIVE MINE BACK?

10:00.151 --> 10:03.119
I COULD, I SUPPOSE,
BUT IT'S RISKY.

10:03.154 --> 10:05.881
THE LAST PRIMES WHO WENT
ON ICE DIED FOREVER.

10:05.915 --> 10:07.123
I'M NOT REALLY
INTO THAT.

10:07.158 --> 10:09.850
BESIDES, POSSESSION
IS 9/10 OF THE LAW,

10:09.885 --> 10:12.266
AND, JUST
BETWEEN US GIRLS,

10:12.301 --> 10:15.442
I KIND OF LIKE
YOUR BODY.

10:15.476 --> 10:17.686
YOU'RE A SOCIOPATH.

10:17.720 --> 10:21.275
JUDGY. BESIDES, LIKE
YOU'RE ONE TO TALK,

10:21.310 --> 10:23.346
WANHEDA.

10:23.381 --> 10:27.005
THE WAY I SEE IT,
YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS--

10:27.040 --> 10:29.870
TELL ME HOW YOU SURVIVED
SO I CAN FIX IT,

10:29.905 --> 10:31.147
AND I'LL MAKE SURE
YOUR PEOPLE

10:31.182 --> 10:33.736
LIKE HAPPILY EVER AFTER
OR DON'T,

10:33.771 --> 10:35.289
AND EVENTUALLY,
WE'LL BOTH DIE, ANYWAY.

10:35.324 --> 10:38.396
THE DIFFERENCE IS, I'LL BE
REBORN IN SOMEONE ELSE,

10:38.430 --> 10:39.466
TELL MY FATHER
WHAT HAPPENED,

10:39.500 --> 10:42.434
AND HE'LL KICK YOUR PEOPLE
OUT TO DIE IN THE WOODS.

10:42.469 --> 10:44.229
GO FLOAT YOURSELF.

10:44.264 --> 10:45.714
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT MEANS.

10:45.748 --> 10:48.302
IT MEANS THAT I'M NOT
TELLING YOU ANYTHING,

10:48.337 --> 10:50.960
AND I DON'T
GO DOWN EASY.

10:50.995 --> 10:55.344
WOW. YOU'RE SELFISH,
NOT TO MENTION DUMB.

10:55.378 --> 10:58.312
YOUR MINDSPACE CONTAINS
ALL YOUR MEMORIES,

10:58.347 --> 11:02.731
SO TRY NOT TO THINK
OF WHERE YOU KEEP THEM.

11:07.425 --> 11:09.807
HELLO.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.188
YOU CONTROL YOUR
MINDSPACE, CLARKE.

11:12.223 --> 11:15.364
TOO BAD YOU CAN'T
CONTROL YOUR THOUGHTS.

11:17.366 --> 11:21.853
I RESCIND MY COMPLIMENTS.
THIS IS A DISASTER.

11:21.888 --> 11:23.510
DIDN'T ANYONE
EVER TEACH YOU

11:23.544 --> 11:25.374
ABOUT ORGANIZATIONAL
STRUCTURE?

11:25.408 --> 11:27.100
GET OUT OF MY HEAD.

11:27.134 --> 11:31.967
NOW, NOW, CLARKE.
SHARING IS CARING.

11:35.833 --> 11:38.939
MADI'S VOICE:
CLARKE! WATCH OUT!

11:38.974 --> 11:40.009
AAH!

11:40.044 --> 11:42.529
CLARKE'S VOICE: I WILL NOT
LET YOU DIE IN THIS WAR.

11:42.563 --> 11:47.189
CHILD ABUSE DRESSED UP
AS PROTECTION. COOL.

11:47.223 --> 11:49.363
- CLARKE, WAIT.
- REALLY?

11:49.398 --> 11:52.919
ARE YOU HIDING A MEMORY
FROM ME, CLARKE?

11:52.953 --> 11:56.819
- RUDE.
- YOU'LL NEVER FIND IT.

11:56.854 --> 12:00.236
YOU KNOW, I STUDY
ALL LIFE, BUT INSECTS

12:00.271 --> 12:03.170
ALWAYS FASCINATED
ME MOST.

12:03.205 --> 12:06.518
THEY'RE MERCILESS,
RUTHLESS.

12:06.553 --> 12:08.175
I RESPECT THAT.

12:08.210 --> 12:13.802
PEOPLE ARE SO MESSY,
SO EMOTIONAL.

12:13.836 --> 12:17.253
BECAUSE OF THAT, THEY
GIVE THEMSELVES AWAY.

12:17.288 --> 12:19.531
I COULD ALWAYS
FIGURE PEOPLE OUT,

12:19.566 --> 12:20.809
EVEN AS A KID.

12:20.843 --> 12:22.258
I COULD TELL WHEN
THEY WERE NERVOUS.

12:22.293 --> 12:24.191
THEIR PULSES
WOULD BEAT FASTER.

12:24.226 --> 12:27.091
EYES WOULD DART.
BREATH WOULD QUICKEN.

12:27.125 --> 12:29.403
IT'S PHYSIOLOGICAL.

12:29.438 --> 12:31.198
YOU KNOW WHAT
MY SPIDEY SENSES

12:31.233 --> 12:33.200
ARE TELLING ME
ABOUT YOU RIGHT NOW?

12:33.235 --> 12:35.409
THAT I'LL NEVER HELP
YOU WIPE MY MIND?

12:35.444 --> 12:36.997
YOU THINK
YOU'RE A BADASS,

12:37.032 --> 12:38.896
BUT YOUR BRAVADO
COVERS SELF-DOUBT.

12:38.930 --> 12:40.207
YOU HAD TO PHYSICALIZE
YOUR SECRET

12:40.242 --> 12:43.210
SO YOU COULD KEEP IT CLOSE,
WHERE YOU HAVE CONTROL.

12:43.245 --> 12:47.318
I BET YOU HAVE IT
ON YOU RIGHT NOW.

12:47.352 --> 12:49.492
NOW LET ME HAVE IT.

13:03.368 --> 13:05.198
OH, SH--

13:05.646 --> 13:07.890
OH!

13:11.618 --> 13:14.345
UH!

13:29.187 --> 13:33.951
VOICE: WARNING. COLLISION ALERT.

13:40.923 --> 13:44.409
JOSEPHINE:
WE'RE BACK, BITCHES.

13:44.444 --> 13:45.652
- HOW?
- COME ON.

13:45.686 --> 13:47.136
YOU'RE SMARTER
THAN THAT.

13:47.171 --> 13:48.931
HOW DO YOU THINK
WE'RE RESURRECTED?

13:48.966 --> 13:51.071
MY MIND DRIVE BACKS UP
MY CONSCIOUSNESS.

13:51.106 --> 13:53.280
I CAN'T DIE
IN THE MINDSPACE,

13:53.315 --> 13:56.042
BUT YOU CAN UNLESS
WHATEVER FLUKE

13:56.076 --> 13:58.009
KEPT YOU HERE
CAN BRING YOU BACK.

13:58.044 --> 14:00.080
YOU, MY FRIEND,
ARE PLAYING FOR KEEPS.

14:00.115 --> 14:02.220
I TOOK A SEDATIVE
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO,

14:02.255 --> 14:03.497
SO THAT GIVES ME
ALL NIGHT

14:03.532 --> 14:06.121
TO KILL YOU IN HERE
OR FIND THE MEMORY

14:06.155 --> 14:08.330
OF HOW I CAN
KILL YOU OUT THERE.

14:08.364 --> 14:12.299
GOT A PREFERENCE?

14:13.404 --> 14:19.893
EASY OR HARD WAY, CLARKE,
EITHER WAY, YOU DIE.

14:39.292 --> 14:42.226
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

14:42.260 --> 14:44.607
I JUST HAVE TO STAY
AHEAD OF HER.

14:44.642 --> 14:46.230
- IF I CAN HIDE--
- YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT,

14:46.264 --> 14:51.269
AREN'T YOU, HIDING
WHILE OTHER PEOPLE FIGHT.

14:51.304 --> 14:52.236
WHAT?

14:52.270 --> 14:54.203
YOU DID THAT
DURING THE CONCLAVE.

14:54.238 --> 14:56.585
WHILE I WAS UP THERE
FIGHTING FOR EVERYONE'S LIVES,

14:56.619 --> 15:02.384
YOU WERE DOWN HERE
STEALING WHAT I BLED FOR.

15:02.418 --> 15:06.008
WHATEVER. FINE.
YOU WROTE ME OFF,

15:06.043 --> 15:09.425
THE CONCLAVE
AT TONDC--I GET IT--

15:09.460 --> 15:12.566
BUT THE THING IS,
I REALLY THOUGHT

15:12.601 --> 15:15.673
YOU CARED
ABOUT BELLAMY.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.676
I CARE
ABOUT BOTH OF YOU.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.299
BUT YOU LEFT HIM IN
THE PITS TO DIE, ANYWAY.

15:21.334 --> 15:25.234
I HAD TO, AND
HE UNDERSTANDS.

15:25.269 --> 15:27.305
HE FORGAVE ME.

15:27.340 --> 15:30.722
DID HE?

15:30.757 --> 15:34.347
THEN WHY ISN'T HE HERE
IN THIS MEMORY?

15:34.381 --> 15:36.211
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

15:36.245 --> 15:38.075
BECAUSE YOU'RE
TOO AFRAID TO FACE HIM

15:38.109 --> 15:40.663
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE THINKS
YOU'RE A MONSTER

15:40.698 --> 15:43.045
WHO WILL ABANDON
ANYONE.

15:43.080 --> 15:44.081
THAT IS NOT
WHO I AM.

15:44.115 --> 15:47.256
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE
ARGUING WITH ME, CLARKE.

15:47.291 --> 15:49.017
AFTER ALL, I'M JUST

15:49.051 --> 15:51.433
A SUBCONSCIOUS
PROJECTION OF YOU.

15:51.467 --> 15:54.056
VOICE: WARNING. COLLISION ALERT.

16:01.546 --> 16:05.412
- HELP ME.
- THAT'LL HAPPEN.

16:06.517 --> 16:10.279
HA HA!
YOU LOOK FUN.

16:10.314 --> 16:13.696
HAVE AT HER.

16:13.731 --> 16:18.598
EVEN YOUR PROJECTIONS
HATE YOU, CLARKE.

16:42.863 --> 16:45.487
MAYA?

16:51.562 --> 16:52.563
HI, CLARKE.

16:52.597 --> 16:56.049
NO. I DON'T WANT THIS.
I DON'T WANT ANY OF THIS.

16:56.084 --> 16:58.810
THAT'S THE THING,
CLARKE.

16:58.845 --> 17:01.365
SOME PART OF YOU
DOES WANT THIS,

17:01.399 --> 17:03.194
OR I WOULDN'T
BE HERE.

17:03.229 --> 17:04.540
I HAVE A QUESTION
OF YOU.

17:04.575 --> 17:08.199
WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING
SO HARD TO STAY ALIVE?

17:08.234 --> 17:11.202
- I HAVE TO--
- SAVE YOUR PEOPLE. YES. I KNOW.

17:11.237 --> 17:15.344
TOO BAD I WASN'T
IN THAT GROUP, HUH?

17:15.379 --> 17:18.658
I NEVER MEANT
TO HURT YOU, MAYA.

17:18.692 --> 17:21.557
I'M SORRY.

17:21.592 --> 17:25.837
YOU KEEP SAYING THAT.

17:25.872 --> 17:30.842
TELL ME, ARE YOU
SORRY ABOUT JASPER, TOO?

17:30.877 --> 17:33.190
AFTER ALL, KILLING ME
IS WHAT SENT HIM

17:33.224 --> 17:34.743
OFF THE DEEP END.

17:34.777 --> 17:37.194
- JASPER MADE HIS CHOICE.
- WRONG.

17:37.228 --> 17:39.403
HIS DEATH
IS ON YOU, TOO.

17:39.437 --> 17:42.716
YOU DO THINGS, BUT OTHER
PEOPLE PAY THE PRICE.

17:42.751 --> 17:43.683
OK. THAT'S ENOUGH.

17:43.717 --> 17:47.204
YOU'VE KILLED MORE
PEOPLE THAN YOU'VE SAVED.

17:47.238 --> 17:48.826
DO YOU REALIZE THAT?

17:48.860 --> 17:50.448
IF YOU
ACTUALLY CARED

17:50.483 --> 17:53.520
ABOUT SAVING
PEOPLE'S LIVES,

17:53.555 --> 17:56.178
YOU'D WALK AWAY.

17:56.213 --> 17:57.766
YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

17:57.800 --> 18:00.182
YOU LIKE BEING
THE SAVIOR.

18:00.217 --> 18:01.459
YOU LIKE PLAYING GOD.

18:01.494 --> 18:06.223
YOU'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT
FROM THE PRIMES, YOU KNOW.

18:06.257 --> 18:09.157
VOICE: RADIATION ALERT.

18:09.191 --> 18:10.261
SHE'S COMING.

18:10.296 --> 18:12.367
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GIVE IN TO HER?

18:12.401 --> 18:14.748
JUST GIVE UP
CONTROL FOR ONCE.

18:17.234 --> 18:19.512
CONTROL.

18:19.546 --> 18:23.895
I'M IN CONTROL.
HUH.

18:26.519 --> 18:29.349
I HAVE AN IDEA.

18:39.704 --> 18:41.154
WHOA.

18:41.189 --> 18:44.502
YOU HAVE A LITTLE
SOMETHING--

18:44.537 --> 18:46.849
OH. HEH.

18:46.884 --> 18:48.851
SHE HID IT
IN THE CAVE.

18:48.886 --> 18:50.750
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

18:50.784 --> 18:54.926
I MEAN, YOUR PROJECTIONS
ARE THE BEST.

18:54.961 --> 18:59.172
- CARE TO TAKE US?
- MM-HMM.

19:00.898 --> 19:04.281
JOSEPHINE:
THANK YOU, MELTY GIRL.

19:04.315 --> 19:07.698
NICE PARKING SPOT.

19:11.391 --> 19:13.290
UGH! UHH...

19:13.324 --> 19:14.325
GOTCHA.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.672
YOU HAVE NO CONTROL HERE.
THIS IS MY MINDSPACE.

19:16.707 --> 19:19.813
TURNS OUT, I CAN CREATE
WHATEVER I WANT,

19:19.848 --> 19:23.783
INCLUDING HER.

19:23.817 --> 19:26.337
CUTE.

19:26.372 --> 19:28.615
I WOULDN'T BOTHER.

19:28.650 --> 19:31.342
THE COLLAR IS
GEOTAGGED TO THE CAVE.

19:31.377 --> 19:35.726
OK. WHAT'S YOUR PLAN HERE,
STALL UNTIL I WAKE UP?

19:35.760 --> 19:40.834
I'LL JUST TRY AGAIN
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT,

19:40.869 --> 19:42.560
AND THE MORE TIME
I SPEND HERE,

19:42.595 --> 19:45.011
THE FASTER YOU DIE,
AND LET ME TELL YOU,

19:45.045 --> 19:47.703
THAT DEATH AIN'T
FUN OR PRETTY.

19:47.738 --> 19:50.016
YOU CAN'T WIN,
SO WHY BOTHER?

19:50.050 --> 19:51.983
TO MAKE SURE YOU LOSE.

19:52.018 --> 19:54.676
ME, I'LL FIND
A WAY TO SURVIVE.

19:54.710 --> 19:56.471
I ALWAYS DO.

19:56.505 --> 20:00.302
YOU GOT SPUNK.
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

20:00.337 --> 20:04.272
THINGS WERE DIFFERENT,
WE COULD HAVE BEEN FRIENDS,

20:04.306 --> 20:06.584
BUT I'M BORED NOW.

20:07.689 --> 20:10.899
NNGH! UGH! AAGH!

20:10.933 --> 20:15.731
UGH! AAGH! AAH!

20:15.766 --> 20:18.389
UGH! UGH!

20:19.563 --> 20:21.737
HEY, CLARKE,
I MAY NOT BE ABLE

20:21.772 --> 20:23.670
TO CREATE ANYTHING
IN YOUR MINDSPACE,

20:23.705 --> 20:25.362
BUT I CAN SURE
BRING SOMETHING IN.

20:25.396 --> 20:27.950
LET'S SPLIT UP AND
STOP PLAYING GAMES.

20:27.985 --> 20:29.883
YOU'RE NOT A CAT
TOYING WITH A MOUSE.

20:29.918 --> 20:34.509
SHE'S DANGEROUS.
KILL HER.

20:50.041 --> 20:52.803
RUSSELL: EVER TAKE
ZOOLOGY 101, CLARKE--

20:52.837 --> 20:55.392
HUNTING TACTICS
OF PREDATOR SPECIES?

20:55.426 --> 20:57.773
NO? HOW ABOUT
A QUICK LESSON, THEN?

20:57.808 --> 20:59.465
- THE MOST COMMON...
- ...PURSUIT PREDATORS

20:59.499 --> 21:01.674
EXPEND ENERGY RUNNING
DOWN SLOWER PREY,

21:01.708 --> 21:04.780
OR THEY PACE THEMSELVES AND
LET THEIR PREY TIRE OUT.

21:04.815 --> 21:06.886
I'M PROPOSING
A THIRD OPTION--

21:06.920 --> 21:08.370
JUST SHOW ME
WHERE YOU HID IT

21:08.405 --> 21:10.372
SO WE CAN BOTH
KICK BACK AND REST.

21:10.407 --> 21:14.411
ALL THIS RUNNING
IS PLAIN UNDIGNIFIED.

21:28.632 --> 21:32.808
WHY DID YOU
AVOID THIS?

21:32.843 --> 21:34.845
HEH.

21:34.879 --> 21:37.710
"GO FLOAT YOURSELF."

21:38.987 --> 21:41.610
A-PLUS ZOOLOGY 101, CLARKE.

21:41.645 --> 21:45.027
THAT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE
DISTRACTION DISPLAY,

21:45.062 --> 21:47.823
BUT I KNOW BETTER.

21:53.553 --> 21:55.659
YAHTZEE.

22:04.875 --> 22:07.912
LET ME GUESS.

22:08.706 --> 22:11.364
CLARKE:
GET AWAY FROM THAT.

22:11.399 --> 22:14.022
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK.

22:15.748 --> 22:17.577
OH, HEY, CLARKE.

22:17.612 --> 22:19.959
THIS IS THE PLACE
YOU WERE AVOIDING?

22:19.993 --> 22:23.100
IT'S NOT EVEN
THAT SCARY.

22:23.134 --> 22:26.828
HUH. IT'S A LITTLE
OMINOUS.

22:26.862 --> 22:28.692
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

22:28.726 --> 22:30.418
IT WAS CLEVER
HIDING IT HERE,

22:30.452 --> 22:31.729
THE PLACE
YOU WOULDN'T GO

22:31.764 --> 22:33.455
SO THE PLACE
I WOULDN'T LOOK.

22:33.490 --> 22:35.871
MEMORY IS FUNNY,
YOU KNOW?

22:35.906 --> 22:37.597
THE FORMATIVE STUFF--
THE TRAUMAS,

22:37.632 --> 22:40.704
THE THINGS
WE CAN'T MOVE PAST--

22:40.738 --> 22:42.602
THEY LIVE DEEP
IN THE BRAIN STEM.

22:42.637 --> 22:45.950
THESE ARE THE WOUNDS WE
PAY SHRINKS NOT TO FIX.

22:45.985 --> 22:49.022
THESE PLACES CONTROL US,

22:49.057 --> 22:50.127
MAKE US WHO WE ARE.

22:50.161 --> 22:52.923
IT'S ACTUALLY CONNECTED TO
THE LOWER BRAIN FUNCTION--

22:52.957 --> 22:54.787
BREATHING, REFLEXES.

22:54.821 --> 22:58.100
IT'S WHY YOU CRY WHEN
YOU THINK OF LEXA.

22:58.135 --> 22:59.170
SHUT UP.

22:59.205 --> 23:02.760
ALL OF THIS IS GUILT
FOR THE DEATHS YOU'VE CAUSED,

23:02.795 --> 23:05.453
BUT I DON'T GET IT.

23:05.487 --> 23:07.627
WHY ARE YOU SO TORN UP?

23:07.662 --> 23:09.733
EVERYTHING YOU DID
WAS TO SAVE YOUR PEOPLE.

23:09.767 --> 23:12.563
- I'D DO THE SAME THING.
- A RINGING ENDORSEMENT.

23:12.598 --> 23:16.981
THE THING I DON'T GET
IS WHY YOU DON'T CARE

23:17.016 --> 23:19.570
ABOUT SAVING
YOUR PEOPLE NOW.

23:19.605 --> 23:20.468
WHAT?

23:20.502 --> 23:22.159
LET'S SAY YOU COULD
SOMEHOW FIGHT ME OFF

23:22.193 --> 23:23.816
AND GET YOUR BODY BACK.

23:23.850 --> 23:26.784
WHAT WOULD THAT DO TO
YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY?

23:26.819 --> 23:30.063
DO YOU THINK MY FATHER
WOULD JUST LET ME GO?

23:30.098 --> 23:33.239
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
RIGHT NOW

23:33.273 --> 23:35.724
LEADS TO THE GENOCIDE
OF YOUR PEOPLE,

23:35.759 --> 23:38.244
WHICH, I GUESS, IS PAR
FOR THE COURSE WITH YOU.

23:38.278 --> 23:40.798
- I JUST WANT TO LIVE.
- DO YOU, THOUGH?

23:40.833 --> 23:44.526
BECAUSE YOUR MIND
SURE DOESN'T SEEM TO.

23:44.561 --> 23:47.218
HAVE YOU EVER EVEN ONCE
CONSIDERED THAT

23:47.253 --> 23:50.256
THE SOLUTION IS TO
SACRIFICE YOURSELF?

23:50.290 --> 23:54.812
YOUR PEOPLE ARE SAFE.
BELLAMY MADE SURE OF IT.

23:54.847 --> 23:56.849
I MEAN, HE TOOK
YOUR DEATH HARD, SURE,

23:56.883 --> 23:59.679
BUT HE KNEW THE ONLY
THING A LEADER COULD DO

23:59.714 --> 24:02.026
WAS TO STRIKE
A DEAL FOR PEACE.

24:02.061 --> 24:04.235
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO STEP UP.

24:04.270 --> 24:06.583
BOW OUT GRACEFULLY,
AND YOUR PEOPLE

24:06.617 --> 24:08.964
GET TO LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

24:08.999 --> 24:10.103
YOU'RE LYING.

24:10.138 --> 24:12.761
BELLAMY WOULD NEVER
MAKE A DEAL LIKE THAT.

24:12.796 --> 24:15.937
THE LACK OF TRUST
HURTS ME, CLARKE,

24:15.971 --> 24:19.043
SO THAT'S WHY
I BROUGHT THIS.

24:19.078 --> 24:22.599
YOU HAVE DRAWINGS.
I HAVE BOOKS. DON'T JUDGE.

24:22.633 --> 24:25.809
HERE. TAKE IT.

24:25.843 --> 24:31.849
IT'S NOT A TRICK.
I DON'T PLAY THAT WAY.

24:35.612 --> 24:38.235
I CAN GUARANTEE SAFETY FOR
THE REST OF YOUR PEOPLE.

24:38.269 --> 24:40.202
WE'LL SHARE EVERYTHING
WE'VE LEARNED

24:40.237 --> 24:41.859
ABOUT SURVIVING
ON THIS MOON.

24:41.894 --> 24:46.312
I'LL TAKE YOUR DEAL
BECAUSE IT'S THE SMART PLAY

24:46.346 --> 24:49.867
AND IT'S THE MOVE
SHE WOULD HAVE MADE.

24:51.731 --> 24:53.319
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO SACRIFICE

24:53.353 --> 24:55.286
FOR YOUR PEOPLE,
CLARKE.

24:55.321 --> 25:00.291
DON'T START ANOTHER WAR
THEY'LL HAVE TO FIGHT.

25:05.227 --> 25:06.919
I NEED THEM TO BE OK.

25:06.953 --> 25:09.646
BY MY WORD, YOUR PEOPLE
WILL BE SAFE.

25:09.680 --> 25:11.199
BELLAMY IS MEETING
WITH MY FATHER

25:11.233 --> 25:12.338
FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING

25:12.372 --> 25:13.960
TO DISCUSS BUILDING
THEM A COMPOUND.

25:13.995 --> 25:16.307
THEY'LL HAVE A NEW
HOME, A NEW LIFE.

25:16.342 --> 25:19.310
MADI CAN GO TO SCHOOL
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER KID.

25:19.345 --> 25:21.278
YOUR FRIENDS
CAN SETTLE DOWN.

25:21.312 --> 25:26.525
EVERYONE CAN STOP
FIGHTING, INCLUDING YOU.

25:36.293 --> 25:39.745
TELL MADI I LOVE HER...

25:40.090 --> 25:43.024
AND TELL
ALL OF THEM.

25:55.312 --> 25:58.315
YOU FORGOT BELLAMY AND RAVEN.

26:09.913 --> 26:11.811
JAKE: SENIOR
ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEER,

26:11.846 --> 26:13.675
DEPUTY RESOURCE OFFICER.

26:13.710 --> 26:16.609
THAT MEANS I'M IN CHARGE
OF THE MACHINES

26:16.644 --> 26:19.232
THAT KEEP OUR WATER
SAFE TO DRINK

26:19.267 --> 26:24.272
AND OUR FOOD SAFE TO EAT.

26:25.722 --> 26:29.691
- UH!
- AAH!

26:31.935 --> 26:34.696
AN EMP.

26:34.731 --> 26:37.734
COOL.

26:39.114 --> 26:42.877
IT'LL BE
OVER SOON....

26:44.430 --> 26:47.295
I PROMISE.

27:38.277 --> 27:40.831
DAD?

27:51.014 --> 27:53.085
OH, MONTY...

27:53.982 --> 27:55.846
HEH.

27:55.881 --> 27:59.091
YOU CALL THIS
DOING BETTER?

28:01.852 --> 28:04.199
GIVING UP
ISN'T BETTER.

28:04.234 --> 28:06.857
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M--

28:06.892 --> 28:09.170
I'M DOING THIS
FOR THE OTHERS.

28:09.204 --> 28:13.036
- THEY'LL LIVE.
- "IT'S ALL FOR MY PEOPLE"?

28:13.070 --> 28:15.279
LOOK. I'VE HEARD THAT
BEFORE, CLARKE.

28:15.314 --> 28:16.142
IT'S JUST AN EXCUSE.

28:16.177 --> 28:18.835
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
TOLD ME I'M NOT GOD,

28:18.869 --> 28:23.011
THAT I DON'T GET TO
DECIDE WHO LIVES OR DIES.

28:23.046 --> 28:25.151
WELL, YOU GOT
YOUR WISH.

28:25.186 --> 28:28.879
I'M NOT DECIDING
FOR ANYONE ELSE...

28:31.330 --> 28:34.264
JUST FOR ME.

28:35.955 --> 28:37.267
LOOK.

28:37.301 --> 28:39.407
I GET IT.
IT'S BEEN ENDLESS.

28:39.441 --> 28:41.305
BEARING IT SO
WE DON'T HAVE TO,

28:41.340 --> 28:44.964
ANYONE
WOULD BE TIRED...

28:45.447 --> 28:49.141
BUT ARE YOU REALLY
GONNA LEAVE HER?

28:51.937 --> 28:53.524
SHE'S BETTER OFF
WITHOUT ME.

28:53.559 --> 28:57.045
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S TRUE.

28:57.874 --> 29:00.290
MY MOM WILL
TAKE CARE OF HER,

29:00.324 --> 29:02.464
AND BELLAMY ALREADY
MADE A DEAL

29:02.499 --> 29:03.880
THAT KEEPS THEM
ALL SAFE.

29:03.914 --> 29:06.227
THIS IS ABOUT BEING
THE GOOD GUYS. YEAH.

29:06.261 --> 29:08.436
THAT DEAL MEANS OUR
SIDE GETS TO LIVE,

29:08.470 --> 29:09.851
BUT AT WHAT COST?

29:09.886 --> 29:11.128
YOU'RE GIVING IN
TO PEOPLE WHO

29:11.163 --> 29:12.543
MURDER HUMAN BEINGS
TO LIVE FOREVER.

29:12.578 --> 29:15.132
THAT'S EASY TO SAY,
BUT IN THE REAL WORLD,

29:15.167 --> 29:18.826
WE HAVE TO DO WHAT'S
BEST FOR OUR PEOPLE.

29:18.860 --> 29:21.414
DOING THE WRONG THING
IS NEVER WHAT'S BEST.

29:21.449 --> 29:23.485
THE ENDS DON'T
JUSTIFY THE MEANS.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.245
YOU KNOW THAT.

29:24.279 --> 29:26.350
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, MONTY?

29:26.385 --> 29:27.455
IT'S TOO LATE.

29:27.489 --> 29:30.147
JOSEPHINE ALREADY
HAS THE MEMORY.

29:30.182 --> 29:31.528
AS SOON
AS SHE WAKES UP,

29:31.562 --> 29:34.911
SHE'LL KNOW HOW TO
GET ME OUT OF MY HEAD.

29:36.119 --> 29:40.054
IT'S OVER.

29:44.196 --> 29:47.164
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

30:00.281 --> 30:03.836
CLARKE: THIS IS
JOSEPHINE'S MINDSPACE.

30:03.871 --> 30:05.217
SHE CONTROLS IT.

30:05.251 --> 30:08.013
WHAT SHE GONNA DO,
KILL YOU?

30:34.556 --> 30:36.973
WOW.

30:37.007 --> 30:40.873
230 YEARS
OF MEMORIES.

30:46.983 --> 30:48.122
GOOD NEWS IS,

30:48.156 --> 30:50.193
WE CAN AFFECT
HER BODY IN HERE.

30:50.227 --> 30:51.297
BAD NEWS IS,

30:51.332 --> 30:52.920
JOSEPHINE SEEMS
TO SENSE IT.

30:52.954 --> 30:55.612
COME ON. LET'S FIND
SOMETHING WE CAN USE.

31:07.003 --> 31:09.660
CLARKE: THEY'RE ALL
IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER.

31:09.695 --> 31:13.872
I LIKE YOUR
DRAWINGS BETTER.

31:22.535 --> 31:23.502
LOOK.

31:23.536 --> 31:25.400
THIS MUST BE WHERE SHE
KEEPS HER PRIMAL WOUNDS.

31:25.435 --> 31:29.094
SHE SAID THEY CREATE
A PHYSICAL RESPONSE.

31:31.027 --> 31:34.306
WE COULD CONTROL
MY BODY FROM THERE.

31:34.340 --> 31:37.654
ON IT. THIS'LL
TAKE A MINUTE.

31:37.688 --> 31:40.036
FIND OUT WHO SHE IS
WHILE I GET THIS OPEN.

31:40.070 --> 31:42.279
RUSSELL'S VOICE:
ONE MORE TIME.

31:42.314 --> 31:47.422
JOSEPHINE'S VOICE:
B-O-R-N-E-O.

31:49.355 --> 31:52.220
KAYLEE: YOU CAN
ADMIT IT, JOSEPHINE.

31:52.255 --> 31:54.153
YOU HAVE A FIXATION.

31:55.465 --> 31:58.019
IT'S CALLED
APPRECIATION.

31:58.054 --> 31:58.744
OH.

31:58.778 --> 32:01.195
DON'T YOU MISS
YOUR FIRST BODY?

32:01.229 --> 32:03.162
I'M ALL ABOUT
LIVING IN THE NOW,

32:03.197 --> 32:04.646
FOCUSING ON THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE HERE,

32:04.681 --> 32:07.304
NOT THOSE FADED
INTO DUST.

32:07.339 --> 32:10.376
MAYBE IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO REFOCUS

32:10.411 --> 32:12.171
ON YOUR OWN KIND.

32:12.206 --> 32:14.035
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
AREN'T WORTH

32:14.070 --> 32:15.174
YOUR ATTENTION,
LEE-LEE.

32:15.209 --> 32:19.523
WELL, WHAT CAN I SAY?
I AM OPEN-MINDED.

32:19.558 --> 32:21.387
OHH! HUH!

32:21.422 --> 32:25.771
THIS JO JUICE IS REALLY
GETTING ME TONIGHT.

32:25.805 --> 32:30.051
IS IT? HMM.

32:30.672 --> 32:33.365
KAYLEE: HUH.

32:40.337 --> 32:44.376
THIS ISN'T JUST J-JUICE.

32:45.032 --> 32:48.449
SHUIMIAN JIANGGUO?

32:49.415 --> 32:52.177
I THOUGHT IT WAS FITTING,
GIVEN YOU CATALOGED THEM,

32:52.211 --> 32:54.593
THOUGH I STILL THINK
THAT YOU COULD'VE BEAT

32:54.627 --> 32:56.388
"SLEEPING BERRIES."

32:56.422 --> 33:00.599
- HMM.
- TELL ME WHY.

33:01.807 --> 33:05.224
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,
LEE-LEE,

33:05.259 --> 33:06.501
ISAAC WAS A THREAT.

33:06.536 --> 33:09.470
HE'D NEVER HURT ANYONE,
AND HE WAS MINE.

33:09.504 --> 33:11.644
WHAT, YOU COULDN'T
STAND TO SEE ME HAPPY?

33:11.679 --> 33:13.646
HE DEFIED THE WILL
OF THE PRIMES.

33:13.681 --> 33:15.338
HE DEFIED OBLATION.

33:15.372 --> 33:17.616
THAT'S NOT THE WILL
OF THE PRIMES.

33:17.650 --> 33:18.686
THAT'S JUST YOU.

33:18.720 --> 33:22.207
ONLY TWO HOSTS HAVE BEEN
BORN IN THE PAST 20 YEARS.

33:22.241 --> 33:24.623
THE NULLS ARE MUDDYING
THE BLOODLINE.

33:24.657 --> 33:27.419
WITHOUT OBLATION,
WE GO EXTINCT.

33:27.453 --> 33:30.180
HELL, YOU HELPED ME
SPREAD THE WORD

33:30.215 --> 33:33.770
BEFORE YOU DECIDED TO HOP
IN THE SACK WITH ISAAC.

33:33.804 --> 33:35.461
NOW YOU'RE SOUNDING
LIKE RIKER.

33:35.496 --> 33:36.669
PEOPLE ARE MORE
THAN THEIR BLOOD.

33:36.704 --> 33:38.671
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE.

33:38.706 --> 33:40.363
YOUR ANSWER
IS MURDER?

33:40.397 --> 33:42.503
DID YOU THINK
I WOULDN'T NOTICE?

33:42.537 --> 33:44.263
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU,

33:44.298 --> 33:46.127
BUT THIS IS NOT
WHO YOU ARE.

33:46.162 --> 33:48.543
I'M GETTING BORED. WHY
THE HELL DID YOU DRUG ME?

33:48.578 --> 33:50.821
SO THEY BELIEVE THIS
WAS AN ACCIDENT.

33:50.856 --> 33:52.616
LET GO OF ME. UH!

33:52.651 --> 33:54.135
AAH!

34:18.711 --> 34:23.061
JOSEPHINE: YOU MUST THINK
VERY LITTLE OF ME, ISAAC.

34:24.717 --> 34:27.272
DID YOU THINK
I WOULDN'T NOTICE

34:27.306 --> 34:29.170
MY OFFERING
WAS GOING MISSING?

34:29.205 --> 34:31.586
THE FOREST DOESN'T
FEED THAT QUICKLY.

34:31.621 --> 34:33.312
ARE YOU GIVING THEM
TO GABRIEL?

34:33.347 --> 34:36.591
ISAAC: JOSEPHINE,
I CAN EXPLAIN.

34:36.626 --> 34:37.454
OH, I GET IT.

34:37.489 --> 34:39.353
YOU THINK BECAUSE
YOU'RE KAYLEE'S PET,

34:39.387 --> 34:41.458
YOU'RE MORE
THAN WHAT YOU ARE.

34:41.493 --> 34:44.461
I AM.
WE ALL ARE.

34:44.496 --> 34:45.911
JUST BECAUSE WE
CAN'T BEAR A HOST

34:45.945 --> 34:47.775
DOESN'T MEAN
WE'RE WORTHLESS.

34:47.809 --> 34:49.397
I AGREE.

34:49.432 --> 34:50.295
REALLY?

34:50.329 --> 34:53.505
WORTHLESS IMPLIES
A SORT OF NEUTRALITY,

34:53.539 --> 34:56.370
SOMETHING WITH NO
POSITIVE VALUE,

34:56.404 --> 35:00.719
BUT NULLS, YOU ARE
LESS THAN USELESS.

35:00.753 --> 35:02.548
YOU DILUTE
THE BLOODLINE.

35:02.583 --> 35:03.687
YOU MAKE IT LESS LIKELY

35:03.722 --> 35:05.241
THAT ANYONE
WOULD BEAR A HOST.

35:05.275 --> 35:06.759
I CAN'T
LET THAT HAPPEN.

35:06.794 --> 35:08.899
I HAVE TO THINK
OF MY PEOPLE.

35:08.934 --> 35:11.868
ISAAC: WE ARE
YOUR PEOPLE.

35:11.902 --> 35:13.318
WE COULD
BE SO MUCH MORE.

35:13.352 --> 35:15.458
WE COULD DO SO MUCH MORE,
IF ONLY WE WERE ALLOWED

35:15.492 --> 35:17.494
TO TRULY LIVE,
IF YOU WOULD LET US

35:17.529 --> 35:19.772
BE MORE THAN JUST YOUR
JANITORS OR GUARDS.

35:19.807 --> 35:21.774
THAT ARGUMENT WOULD
CARRY A LOT MORE WEIGHT

35:21.809 --> 35:26.400
IF YOU WEREN'T DELIVERING
SOLDIERS TO OUR ENEMIES.

35:26.434 --> 35:28.781
TELL ME,
HOW IS GABRIEL?

35:28.816 --> 35:31.750
HIS LATEST HOST
MUST BE 95 BY NOW.

35:31.784 --> 35:35.892
I'M JUST TRYING TO
KEEP OUR PEOPLE ALIVE.

35:35.926 --> 35:37.652
OBLATION IS WRONG.

35:37.687 --> 35:39.792
WHY SHOULD THIS CHILD
BE SACRIFICED?

35:39.827 --> 35:42.174
- HE'S DONE NOTH--
- MM!

35:50.527 --> 35:51.701
DON'T WORRY, ISAAC.

35:51.735 --> 35:55.532
YOUR SPIRIT SHALL
LIVE ETERNAL.

36:01.987 --> 36:07.268
YOU WERE RIGHT.
WE CAN'T LET HER WIN.

36:07.303 --> 36:09.512
ALMOST GOT IT.

36:10.685 --> 36:12.584
YES!

36:16.519 --> 36:20.971
WOMAN: ♪ GOD REST YE,
MERRY GENTLEMEN ♪

36:21.006 --> 36:23.974
♪ LET NOTHING YOU DISMAY

36:24.009 --> 36:27.495
♪ REMEMBER,
CHRIST OUR SAVIOR... ♪

36:27.530 --> 36:30.809
CLARKE: EARTH
BEFORE THE BOMBS.

36:30.843 --> 36:34.744
HEY, CHECK IT OUT.

36:36.780 --> 36:40.577
NICE PLACE.

36:41.958 --> 36:44.754
WHY WOULD SHE KEEP
THIS MEMORY LOCKED AWAY?

36:44.788 --> 36:46.031
MORE IMPORTANTLY,

36:46.065 --> 36:49.517
HOW DO WE GET
CONTROL FROM HERE?

36:56.352 --> 36:59.217
COME ON.

36:59.424 --> 37:02.599
JOSEPHINE: UGH, I SWEAR,
I'M TAKING HANLEN NEXT SEMESTER.

37:02.634 --> 37:04.843
I CAN'T DEAL WITH
SILVESTRI ANYMORE.

37:04.877 --> 37:06.672
WOMAN: DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE NOT GOING

37:06.707 --> 37:09.641
ON YOUR LITTLE,
SECRET FAMILY PROJECT?

37:09.675 --> 37:11.367
I TOLD THEM NO.

37:11.401 --> 37:13.886
WELL, IF YOUR
SIGNING UP FOR HANLEN,

37:13.921 --> 37:15.474
PULL OUT
YOUR MINISKIRTS.

37:15.509 --> 37:18.857
HE GIVES A HALF-GRADE BUMP
TO GIRLS HE LIKES TO LOOK AT.

37:18.891 --> 37:20.030
OH...

37:23.310 --> 37:25.381
HEY.

37:28.556 --> 37:30.040
I WAS LOOKING
FOR YOU

37:30.075 --> 37:32.353
AT THE WATER
RATIONING PROTEST,

37:32.388 --> 37:35.598
THOUGHT YOU POSTED
SOMETHING ABOUT GOING.

37:37.462 --> 37:40.327
TOO MANY PEOPLE,
YOU KNOW.

37:40.361 --> 37:44.745
AND IT'S REALLY
DUSTY OUTSIDE.

37:45.401 --> 37:47.679
YEAH. SURE.

37:48.507 --> 37:51.372
UH, I ASKED, AND
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM

37:51.407 --> 37:53.063
AT THE COMPARATIVE
LINGUISTICS THING

37:53.098 --> 37:54.927
IF YOU WANT TO GO.

37:54.962 --> 37:55.859
I DON'T KNOW.

37:55.894 --> 38:00.036
I'M NOT REALLY FEELING
THAT SOCIAL LATELY.

38:00.070 --> 38:02.418
HEH.

38:04.523 --> 38:09.597
YOU STILL THINK YOU'RE
TOO GOOD FOR ME, HUH?

38:09.839 --> 38:13.601
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I--
- DON'T LIE.

38:13.636 --> 38:15.327
JUST ADMIT IT.

38:15.362 --> 38:18.848
STOP TOYING WITH ME AND
JUST ADMIT WHAT YOU ARE.

38:18.882 --> 38:20.090
I--I DON'T--

38:20.125 --> 38:22.541
I MEAN, I TRIED--
CALLS, TEXTS,

38:22.576 --> 38:26.511
YOU KNOW,
BEING THOUGHTFUL.

38:26.545 --> 38:30.100
WHAT DO I GET?

38:32.482 --> 38:35.451
NOTHING.

38:35.485 --> 38:36.624
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

38:36.659 --> 38:38.764
THINKING YOU SHOULD
SHUT THE HELL UP.

38:38.799 --> 38:41.491
MESSAGE RECEIVED,
YOU STUCK-UP BITCH.

38:41.526 --> 38:44.114
YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE ME.

38:44.149 --> 38:46.393
YOU CAN SEE THIS.

38:52.709 --> 38:54.918
MAN: LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE!

38:54.953 --> 38:57.956
THIS IS THE THING
SHE COULDN'T FACE.

38:57.990 --> 39:01.028
NO WONDER SHE CHANGED
HER MIND ABOUT LEAVING.

39:01.062 --> 39:05.377
WE NEED TO USE IT
TO CONTROL YOUR BODY.

39:05.412 --> 39:06.792
I HAVE AN IDEA.

39:07.759 --> 39:09.139
WOMAN ON P.A.: ALERT.
INCOMING BOMBSHELLS.

39:09.174 --> 39:12.142
TAKE COVER IMMEDIATELY.

39:12.177 --> 39:15.698
QUICK, HIDE.

39:18.908 --> 39:21.600
YOU NEVER SHOULD
HAVE COME HERE!

39:21.635 --> 39:24.776
GET OUT!

39:27.572 --> 39:31.023
AAH! I GAVE YOU THE
CHANCE TO GO QUIETLY.

39:31.058 --> 39:33.716
I SAID I'D HELP
YOUR PEOPLE.

39:33.750 --> 39:36.443
DEAL'S OFF.

39:42.138 --> 39:45.521
SHE'S AWAKE.

39:54.219 --> 39:55.151
I WIN.

39:55.185 --> 39:56.255
BELLAMY: ALL RIGHT.

39:56.290 --> 39:59.535
IN EXCHANGE FOR IGNORING
THAT YOU MURDERED CLARKE...

40:01.778 --> 40:05.403
YOU BUILD US
A COMPOUND.

40:06.680 --> 40:09.199
WHAT ABOUT THE MOTHER AND CHILD?
WILL THEY AGREE?

40:09.234 --> 40:11.788
I'LL HANDLE
OUR PEOPLE.

40:11.823 --> 40:13.721
HOW LONG WILL IT
TAKE TO BUILD?

40:14.791 --> 40:16.828
JUST A MOMENT,
SWEETHEART.

40:16.862 --> 40:19.037
WITH ALL OF OUR PEOPLE
HELPING YOU,

40:19.071 --> 40:20.694
IT WILL GO MUCH FASTER.

40:20.728 --> 40:22.109
TALK TO RIKER
ABOUT A WORK SCHEDULE,

40:22.143 --> 40:25.146
AND YOU'LL NEED A DETAIL
OF ABOUT 50 OF YOUR OWN PEOPLE.

40:25.181 --> 40:28.149
YOU'LL BUILD A WALL THAT--

40:46.582 --> 40:50.102
RUSSELL: BELLAMY.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.555
BELLAMY,
ARE WE AGREED?

40:55.142 --> 40:57.109
YEAH.

40:57.144 --> 41:00.009
WE'RE GOOD FOR NOW.

41:00.043 --> 41:02.977
I'LL ORDER CONSTRUCTION
TO BEGIN.

41:03.012 --> 41:05.014
LET'S GO.

41:14.299 --> 41:15.714
JOSIE...

41:15.749 --> 41:18.545
DID SOMETHING GO WRONG
WITH THE TRANSFER?

41:18.579 --> 41:19.822
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

41:19.856 --> 41:23.619
SHE'S STILL IN MY HEAD,
BUT DON'T WORRY.

41:23.653 --> 41:27.277
I KNOW HOW TO KILL HER
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

41:27.312 --> 41:32.800
HEY, REMEMBER WHEN PIKE
TAUGHT US MORSE CODE?

41:32.835 --> 41:35.320
I SLEPT THROUGH MOST
OF EARTH SKILLS, SO--

41:35.354 --> 41:39.842
OK. JOSEPHINE WAS
TAPPING OUT MORSE CODE

41:39.876 --> 41:42.638
ON HER ARM.

41:46.089 --> 41:47.194
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

41:47.228 --> 41:52.786
IT MEANS CLARKE'S ALIVE,
AND WE'RE GONNA GET HER BACK.
