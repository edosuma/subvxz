02:32.917 --> 02:38.344
I know it's for my own good, but
I really want to scratch ...

02:38.500 --> 02:42.004
My family will not even let me drink from the toilet.

02:42.167 --> 02:47.924
Just prepare a bowl of water, and
obviously someone took a sip.

03:13.458 --> 03:15.677
Sign two!

03:22.125 --> 03:25.550
The same thing ... every day.

03:25.708 --> 03:30.088
- There should be a bully who handle it.
- We can do it together.

03:30.250 --> 03:33.834
I distract them, while kauu ...

03:34.000 --> 03:36.253
Another time...

03:36.417 --> 03:41.093
This is the best throw ...

03:46.792 --> 03:50.001
Oh .. thanks .. newspaper, Ozzy.

03:52.375 --> 03:56.084
- Wait a minute .. let her toast.
- I do not want toast.

03:56.250 --> 04:00.756
- You burn for a long time.
- What do you mean so long?

04:06.292 --> 04:11.719
- No, you must not eat meat. Eat cereal.
- What's the food like sawdust?

04:11.875 --> 04:18.291
Many vitamins and minerals. It feels more
both of sawdust. Maybe.

04:18.458 --> 04:22.292
Not bad.

04:23.917 --> 04:28.172
- You want more?
- No, thank you. My place is full.

04:28.333 --> 04:30.506
I also.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.007
Fence. Tile.
And lawn mowers.

06:07.917 --> 06:12.718
<I> Come and visit Blue Creek.
The dog house in a new way. </ I>

06:18.667 --> 06:22.501
He had been in the house like a prisoner
for two days, Maddie. Two days!

06:22.667 --> 06:27.503
Yesterday .. we missed the truck hot dogs,
and yesterday again the ice cream truck.

06:27.667 --> 06:31.922
If I missed again burritovogna,
life worthless.

06:32.083 --> 06:34.461
You must be patient.

06:34.625 --> 06:40.132
Two-day, Maddie! do you know
how long it's time for a dog?

06:49.083 --> 06:53.793
Not now, Ozzy.
I was still under house arrest.

07:24.458 --> 07:31.546
Ok..Helm, Already!
Mother's favorite flowers, can fix it later. Already!

07:31.708 --> 07:36.259
Direction of the wind, already!
How are you, Ozzy? Are you ready?

08:21.833 --> 08:24.882
Tell me .. Where have you two?

08:46.208 --> 08:49.633
Thank you, Ozzy. I'll take the letter.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.048
Impossible..

09:10.708 --> 09:13.052
We're going to Japan!

09:13.208 --> 09:17.588
A four-star hotel with
everything is free!

09:17.750 --> 09:19.548
So we're going to Europe?

09:19.708 --> 09:23.338
they sent
comic writers to Osaka!

09:23.500 --> 09:28.210
If Si Dog Star wins, he will
get more readers.

09:28.375 --> 09:34.428
"Are you jealous, Pickle?"
"Do you want this bone, Flame?"

09:36.458 --> 09:40.383
Ozzy, we are going to Japan!

09:40.542 --> 09:45.799
- Ozzy will not come to Japan.
- What?

09:46.000 --> 09:50.551
Embassy says that if
we want to bring a dog ...

09:50.708 --> 09:56.010
... He should be quarantined. Two weeks at home.

09:56.167 --> 09:59.922
.. Well maybe we can leave him in person.
- Who?

10:01.500 --> 10:04.003
Come on, Marc.
He was close to the children.

10:04.125 --> 10:08.005
He never made trouble, and he
can use PowerPoint!

10:08.167 --> 10:10.716
He at least had been trained.

10:10.875 --> 10:16.427
Hello? Marc?
Can not.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.551
What if Aunt Mildred?
He was also part of the family.

10:25.708 --> 10:31.795
Yes, the scary part. But when we
I got home, I wish he was still alive.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.927
<I> ... the process has increased and the world
Banking has set a new direction.

10:39.333 --> 10:43.042
<I> Are you going out traveling
and tdak know your dog will stay with whom? </ i>

10:43.208 --> 10:47.008
<I> - He should be in good hands?
- Wait ... still turn on his TV </ i>

10:48.917 --> 10:52.501
I say turn and not turned off.

10:52.667 --> 10:57.093
<I> Come and visit Blue Creek.
The dog house in a new way. </ I>

10:57.250 --> 11:01.300
<I> We serve legged animals
four of these as our friend. </ i>

11:01.458 --> 11:08.000
<I> If you have a female dog,
visit the Golden Meadows. </ i>

11:09.417 --> 11:15.550
- Come here!
- Come on, then!

11:15.708 --> 11:18.552
I caught it!

11:18.708 --> 11:21.336
Running, Ozzy .. Run!

11:24.042 --> 11:29.549
- What happened? What have you done?
- Long story.

11:31.542 --> 11:35.297
dumb dog!

11:35.458 --> 11:38.428
You again?

11:42.208 --> 11:44.757
Move!

11:56.250 --> 12:02.303
Do not worry dear.
A month had passed quickly.

12:13.708 --> 12:19.636
Welcome to Blue Creek.
My name is Nathaniel Robinson.

12:19.792 --> 12:21.886
See .. who come here?

12:22.042 --> 12:26.627
So .. the king's name in this house is .. Ozzy.

12:26.792 --> 12:30.751
He is shy.
We might become good friends.

12:34.750 --> 12:38.175
Sorry. We never let Ozzy out earlier.

12:38.333 --> 12:43.134
I understand once ..
He'll soon change your mind.

12:43.292 --> 12:46.546
Now I'll show you this house ..

12:53.625 --> 12:57.801
Monsieur Melville
selecting food ingredients.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.631
The natural ingredients are organic.
Try a sip.

13:02.792 --> 13:05.090
He hates broccoli.

13:10.292 --> 13:14.126
I introduce ... sauna.

13:18.875 --> 13:21.003
Further to the massage room.

13:22.417 --> 13:29.005
We have to shiatsu shih-tzuer,
mud and relaxation feet.

13:30.875 --> 13:35.631
- For dogs?
- We do not see them like dogs.

13:35.792 --> 13:41.799
They are our best friends, and
friends should be treated well.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.129
Can I stay here for three
week, while you go to Japan?

13:47.375 --> 13:51.209
Sorry. This is not a place for people to stay.

13:51.375 --> 13:54.925
Susan, you've seen the price?

13:55.083 --> 13:58.417
If you find a pet
Your precious ...

13:58.583 --> 14:03.009
but I can recommend
a cheaper alternative.

14:03.167 --> 14:07.126
Less comfortable, natural.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.594
Where do I sign?

14:26.208 --> 14:29.132
Say goodbye to your family.

14:29.292 --> 14:34.674
You will not see them again for a long time.

14:34.833 --> 14:38.212
Get rid of these dogs away from me and call others.

14:42.208 --> 14:45.917
Berahkir spa time. No more spa for you.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.299
What is going on here, guys?

15:08.125 --> 15:13.131
- Can anybody explain what's going on here?
- Shut up and sit in the corner.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.004
Dominic!

15:48.083 --> 15:51.883
Everything came out. visits have berahkir

15:52.042 --> 15:55.842
The claws on his shoulders
and back to the block.

16:01.125 --> 16:05.631
Where am I? Is this a prison?

16:05.792 --> 16:11.504
We had a genius here.

Look, Killer.

17:28.375 --> 17:32.005
Look .. you stretch my legs?

17:32.125 --> 17:38.337
Were you happy to run in vain?

17:58.583 --> 18:01.792
The secret is to
find the center of gravity.

18:06.542 --> 18:10.672
Welcome.
My name is Grunt prison director.

18:10.833 --> 18:15.009
If you're a good dog, you will

18:15.125 --> 18:19.335
Do you have any questions, it's time.

18:19.500 --> 18:24.757
May I ask?
Can I sit down?

18:24.917 --> 18:30.174
This is a mistake.
My family sent me to a resort ...

18:30.333 --> 18:34.008
- Is it true?
- With a swimming pool, sauna and a complete package.

18:34.125 --> 18:40.258
I do not know I so miss ..
But I really like the minimalist.

18:40.417 --> 18:45.674
It is okay.

18:50.583 --> 18:55.259

Now you are number 463.

19:13.208 --> 19:15.006
Put him inside.

19:27.208 --> 19:31.759
Hello, bone fresh meat!
Fresh meat and bone!

19:31.917 --> 19:35.251
Are you going to cry?

19:37.000 --> 19:40.459
He will soon call for a owner.

19:44.458 --> 19:49.635
Shut up, loser!
I will not hear rengekanmu.

19:49.792 --> 19:56.300
Here I am Lord. I see everything, hear
everything, smell everything and knows everything.

19:56.458 --> 20:01.339
So if you want to avoid problems, make yourself comfortable.

20:03.917 --> 20:07.000
This is your new home.

20:15.292 --> 20:21.049
Hey, that's my bed, small.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.927
Now I see better.

20:43.458 --> 20:47.383
So .. how the story?

20:47.542 --> 20:52.002
- Favorite food? Furniture favorite?

20:52.167 --> 20:57.128
"Tranquility in the cell."
Where do you come from?

20:57.292 --> 21:01.377
I tell you, I will not be long
in here.

21:01.542 --> 21:04.546
My family is going to come about a month.

21:04.708 --> 21:07.882
Certain. I also will be picked up ..

21:08.042 --> 21:13.754
- When your family will pick you up, Remy?
- A year ago.

21:13.917 --> 21:16.011
- And you Ross?
- Same.

21:16.167 --> 21:20.718
Listen, I'm sorry guys, but
my family will definitely pick me up

21:20.875 --> 21:25.927
Listen .. it's up to you to entertain yourself ... but listen to me ...

21:26.083 --> 21:29.917
I'm going to escape. You can join us.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.757
Ten o'clock. Lights out.

22:12.917 --> 22:18.253
Sorry. I did not mean it.
I must have kicked in my sleep.

22:18.417 --> 22:23.344
But hey .. it could be worse .. if later I was snoring.

22:23.500 --> 22:27.459
Ayo..bangun slacker!
Let me see you all.

22:27.625 --> 22:31.084
Stand still, 189, otherwise
You're going to put it into the hole.

22:31.250 --> 22:35.426
Do not yawn, 92.
Mouth smell like garbage.

22:35.583 --> 22:38.883
Got something to say?

22:42.542 --> 22:46.547
Chester, this Ozzy,
my new cellmate.

22:48.708 --> 22:52.463
Ayolah..beri him a chance.
It's her first day.

22:52.625 --> 22:57.506
Exactly .. new Children pose problems, Fronky.
You know that.

22:57.667 --> 23:02.093
Quiet! Fixed dibarisanmu ..
Everything is the way forward!

23:11.250 --> 23:16.882
To burn calories, you have
come to the right place.

23:17.042 --> 23:22.253
Every dog ??in siniharus contribute with his legs,
because we have to meet the target quota.

23:22.417 --> 23:26.843
If we do not meet the quota, there will be a problem.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.801
- And we do not want to get into trouble is not it?
- No.

23:37.708 --> 23:43.090
The machine will not stop.
Jikakau tired, resist.

23:43.250 --> 23:47.881
Stick out your tongue, if you're thirsty.
Raise your feet if you have to urinate.

23:48.042 --> 23:50.841
But this machine will not stop.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.005
Any question? So let's get started.

24:18.125 --> 24:24.667
- What are you doing? You'll get us killed!
- I just need to understand the system.

24:31.250 --> 24:34.800
Quiet. I could mengatsinya.

25:01.542 --> 25:04.341
Next!

25:08.292 --> 25:11.842
Next!

25:16.250 --> 25:19.220
What is this? Looks like ...

25:19.375 --> 25:23.460
- Cat food?
- This is disgusting.

25:23.625 --> 25:30.634
- Is there something wrong with the food, 463?
- No, I love it.

26:04.042 --> 26:07.672
You're more annoying
rather than cock.

26:07.833 --> 26:11.588
Nak. Where are you going?

26:14.583 --> 26:20.670
thanks. I named Ozzy.
What is your name?

26:23.333 --> 26:29.340
<I> Now that you know a friend, do not have to meluarkan words.
Now, eat, and enjoy the silence. </ I>

26:38.750 --> 26:42.584
This job is not difficult.

26:42.750 --> 26:47.426
Every morning, we fill the cart in the office and distributing books.

26:47.583 --> 26:52.919
Is that all?
Thank you, because it has helped me.

26:53.083 --> 26:57.168
Finally, the atmosphere was safe and quiet.

26:57.333 --> 26:59.677
- Is she Si Dog Star?
- Yes.

26:59.833 --> 27:06.000
- Do you read comics? Ah impossible.
- I just want to bite something soft.

27:12.417 --> 27:17.002
Let me guess, you memikiran about your family?

27:17.125 --> 27:21.801
Look, if I were you, I would never trust a human.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.550
They are my family. They love me.

27:25.708 --> 27:31.590
Yes, they love us
all, to love it ahkirnya ends

27:31.750 --> 27:36.301
You do not know them.
They did not leave me.

27:56.208 --> 28:00.008
-What happened? Who is that?
- They called Radar.

28:00.125 --> 28:05.052
- Watch Out. He always has an external antenna.
- Hey, Radar ... what is it?

28:05.208 --> 28:09.668
What are you talking about?
Have you ever been to the moon?

28:09.833 --> 28:14.509
This is the sixth day! The sixth day!

28:14.667 --> 28:21.084
Vito is free today.
He always does not follow the rules. A dog that is difficult.

28:21.250 --> 28:23.844
Vito was an intruder. Stay away from him.

28:27.042 --> 28:32.845
- Now the next right? The sixth day.
- Calm down, Radar. You made me a headache.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.426
Do not do anything. Or you can
killed later.

28:46.417 --> 28:51.253
Come on, Vito. Exit.

29:16.542 --> 29:20.467
- How could it be. Is that ...
- What?

29:20.625 --> 29:24.425
Is that Vito?
He was just a Chihua ...

29:37.000 --> 29:40.049
What do you want to go back to the hole, Vito?

29:41.917 --> 29:46.468
We both will meet again later. Soon.

29:46.625 --> 29:49.504
Good so ... good dog.

29:49.667 --> 29:52.090
Who's the clown?

29:52.250 --> 29:55.925
The new kid.
He came yesterday.

29:57.458 --> 30:02.385
You have not been here a week,
but already made new friends.

30:11.792 --> 30:17.925
Fronky, I do not mean to complain,
but we can not we finish the letter later?

30:18.083 --> 30:21.792
Maybe we could tie ....
Fronky?

30:29.625 --> 30:34.335
Did you know ... Fronky escaped.
When I wake up ...

30:37.500 --> 30:43.007
Nice ... this escape attempt were to 15.
He was hiding in the trash.

30:51.708 --> 30:55.884
I almost caught earlier.
Almost.

30:56.042 --> 31:01.424

Decker office.

31:26.333 --> 31:30.042
Decker office.

31:42.542 --> 31:46.592
Decker office.

31:46.750 --> 31:53.588
Why do not you give up?
It's embarrassing for all of us.

31:53.750 --> 31:56.378
Give up? Never!!

31:56.542 --> 32:01.924
You do not understand ... someone is waiting for me out there.
Someone who is blind who need me.

32:02.083 --> 32:06.919

32:12.583 --> 32:17.259
His eyes ??

What's up, loser?
I have a message for you from Vito.

32:24.375 --> 32:27.254
She wants to talk to you.

32:27.417 --> 32:31.547

- Yes, with you .. Do not you understand me?

32:31.708 --> 32:39.001

He's clean, boss.

33:17.542 --> 33:22.093

- Not too.

33:22.250 --> 33:27.427
I thought ,, you will come
in good condition.

33:27.583 --> 33:30.336
What's your sport? Boxing?

33:31.208 --> 33:33.586
No, not boxing.

33:33.750 --> 33:40.713
- I hear you're good at running, and you've got fans.
- I did not say so in fact.

33:40.875 --> 33:45.005
- You mean, anakbuahku lie to me?
- No .. not so

33:45.125 --> 33:48.334

33:48.500 --> 33:54.052

33:54.208 --> 33:56.836
What can you run? Or not?

33:57.000 --> 34:00.425
Yes. No. I do not know.

34:00.583 --> 34:06.340
Quiet. Take a deep breath.

34:06.500 --> 34:10.175
Let me ask you something ..
Do you want to help?

34:10.333 --> 34:16.466
I ... Of course. Whatever you want.
As long as I do not get into trouble.

34:16.625 --> 34:20.333
Problem? Did you hear him? Hehehe..

34:20.500 --> 34:26.337
This child at home and
afraid to get into trouble.

34:27.625 --> 34:32.005
- You're killing me, boy ..
- No, no .. Do not kill

34:32.167 --> 34:35.376
Is it true? Do you want me to kill someone?

34:35.542 --> 34:40.252
No, I just want you to kill yourself.

34:40.417 --> 34:46.550
Killing yourself with berlariii ...
I am just kidding.

34:46.708 --> 34:50.884
I love this dog.
He is very modest.

34:55.000 --> 35:01.167
- Wow ... What's this?
- A race between inmates and guards.

35:01.333 --> 35:08.126
They are the best of the best.
This is our champion, Flash.

35:08.292 --> 35:13.173
He is top class, but
he had lost in the previous game.

35:13.333 --> 35:18.089
You can help him.
You just need to follow the race.

35:21.333 --> 35:23.836
Oh, it's not a joke.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.300
Follow the race, two of three rounds and
give him some resistance.

35:27.458 --> 35:32.089
Let him in front of you ..
Lakukukan me.

35:32.250 --> 35:36.926

because he had dynamite in his paws.

36:21.708 --> 36:25.758
Last post we round ..
What is happening right now?

36:25.917 --> 36:31.924
You lead with moncongdi front of me!
The champion has lost ...

36:32.083 --> 36:36.338
Humiliated at home alone ...

36:36.500 --> 36:42.212
- Goodbye, Flash.
- What do we practice tomorrow?

36:42.375 --> 36:47.006
I did not say so:
"Bye, Flash".

36:47.125 --> 36:50.629
I said, "Goodbye, Flash."

36:53.625 --> 36:57.801
Ozzy, there is an empty spot on the team.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.085
What do you think ... that position?
You want to run me?

37:02.250 --> 37:05.629
What do you mean?
Did you ask the other thing?

37:05.792 --> 37:09.751
No, I'm asking you one thing ...

37:09.917 --> 37:14.377
And you have to do it ...
Now I owe you. That this is an offer.

37:14.542 --> 37:20.003
I want you to be patnerku.
We can beat all opponents.

37:20.167 --> 37:23.501

37:23.667 --> 37:30.755
- Can I think of first?
- Yes, you've got plenty of time.

37:30.917 --> 37:35.343
- You've got 24 hours.
- A day?

37:35.500 --> 37:39.676
It was time that I gave, because aq owe you.
... And now we're even.

37:42.042 --> 37:48.755
This is not true. Do not!
The match was nothing but trouble.

37:48.917 --> 37:53.548
If I enter the competition, we can get
cat food steak not anymore.

37:53.708 --> 37:59.841
Right ... And maybe sorbet for dessert?
Lift your head out of your tail, son.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.086
You can not trust Vito.
See how the latest partner right now.

38:11.125 --> 38:13.799
Yeah right, like I'm better alone.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.756
Btw ... I have a new escape plan, so if you want ...

38:18.917 --> 38:22.000
Tick-tock. Time is running out ... boy.

38:22.125 --> 38:27.632

38:27.792 --> 38:33.549
- Unfortunately I have to reject the offer. But I mengharagai your bid.
- Well .. keep talking.

38:33.708 --> 38:40.250
The world of sports is not for me.
Limelight and attention ....

38:40.417 --> 38:47.505
Are you sure? As I said yesterday,
I can make your life so much easier.

38:47.667 --> 38:51.752
I could also make it easier.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.836
Oops ... apart from me ...

39:09.625 --> 39:13.505
What the hell are you doing, 463?

39:13.667 --> 39:18.298
I'm mencarmu for

39:18.458 --> 39:23.760
- About what?
- Wetting the head. The massage was not working.

39:23.917 --> 39:27.217
Are you kidding, 463?
Do you want something?

39:27.375 --> 39:31.255
Or are you wasting my time again?

39:32.792 --> 39:38.845
Well wel .. so you are beat Flash and now
Vito wants included in the team.

39:39.000 --> 39:43.005

- I know you will understand.

39:43.167 --> 39:47.343
- I'll tell you what to do.
- I'm listening.

39:47.500 --> 39:50.709
- You have to enjoy the game ...
- Perfect ... What?

39:50.875 --> 39:55.551
You will be patnerya, but in
in fact, you are so patnerku.

39:55.708 --> 40:02.125
- How? I do not understand.
- I know you can not beat Jock.

40:02.292 --> 40:07.799
But why take the risk?
We have never lost against resistance.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.834
- Wait a minute
-You Join a game, but you will be defeated.

40:12.000 --> 40:17.461
If I do command,
Vito would have made dog biscuits.

40:17.625 --> 40:20.834
Thank you for the offer, but did not.

40:21.000 --> 40:27.133
What do you think that?
Think about it. Think while you sleep.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.469
I am not going!

40:36.417 --> 40:39.091
You will obey?

40:47.000 --> 40:51.130
Perfect! The size is just right.

40:52.667 --> 40:56.217
Now do llagi.

41:01.875 --> 41:04.003
Next.

41:05.375 --> 41:10.461
I'm actually a little
hungry and I like bones.

41:43.625 --> 41:44.922
What are you doing here?

41:45.083 --> 41:50.795
If you want the hole to
dog, it is our specialty.

41:51.000 --> 41:57.758
What are you going to dig? Or do you keep
dig until you'll find a brontosaurus.

41:57.917 --> 42:02.468
- Thank you, Fronky. Good night.
- Return.

42:10.125 --> 42:15.006
You think this is over?
Welcome to the night shift.

42:18.125 --> 42:22.380
Finish this, and I want also a new hole in the yard.

42:23.583 --> 42:26.382
Sorry if you become involved.

42:26.542 --> 42:30.752
I know you guys think.
I promise .. when my family to pick me up

42:30.917 --> 42:38.256
Family, 463.
They'll pick you up ... about a month?

42:38.417 --> 42:43.878
Guess what ... one month has passed.

42:44.042 --> 42:47.842
And you have not picked up.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.756
That date must be wrong. My family will never let me down.

43:08.375 --> 43:14.633
A young dog in his prime.
We never forget Oscar.

43:14.792 --> 43:19.093
- Ozzy.
- That's what I say.

43:19.250 --> 43:23.756
He fought against the dog flu, and
vet we've done our best.

43:23.917 --> 43:27.171
They're the best.
You can see in the bill.

43:27.333 --> 43:32.919
He's not just a dog.
He is an example for all.

43:33.083 --> 43:38.761
- How he is infected?
- He was infected when he arrived here.

43:38.917 --> 43:43.093
Luckily he did not infect others.
Or it would be a tragedy.

43:43.250 --> 43:47.926
I was sorry for what happened ...

43:48.083 --> 43:53.385
I do not accept it ... I entrust my dog,
and now I just get this ...?
Without any explanation.

43:53.542 --> 43:55.761
- It does not make sense.
- Look at this.

43:55.917 --> 44:00.923
You have mendatanganin agreement, and give all responsibility to us ..

44:08.667 --> 44:14.128
- You win. I will join.
- So you've been thinking healthy.

44:14.292 --> 44:17.671
Yes, I know, I'm just a little stubborn.

44:17.833 --> 44:22.839
Good boy, I was not offended.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.834
Give me a high-five, a friend ...

44:27.667 --> 44:30.546
You better not let me down, partner.

44:30.708 --> 44:34.417
Remember that we are now partners.

44:34.583 --> 44:41.296
- You just have to know what you did yangharus!
- Lost
- Win

44:41.458 --> 44:44.837
Are you going to join the game?
Are you mad?

44:45.000 --> 44:51.007
If you betray each other. If you meniu Grunt,
Decker will further bury the bones themselves.

44:51.125 --> 44:55.585
- I'm not going to trick him.
- Vito'll skin you alive.

44:55.750 --> 44:59.926
- I will not deceive Vito.
- Then what are you doing?

45:00.083 --> 45:03.758
- I'll deceive them both.
- Second?

45:03.917 --> 45:08.002
I will not meddle business.
I wanted to escape from here.

45:08.167 --> 45:11.421
- Last chance. Want to join?
- Okay.

45:11.583 --> 45:14.462
Do not you see ...
Did you say "okay"?

45:14.625 --> 45:19.210
You're right, there is no way out, when I betrayed them,
I would have died.

45:19.375 --> 45:22.925
So, friends, we have to escape.

45:23.083 --> 45:27.088
Good ... Now you're showing taringmu.
Now listen to my plan.

45:27.250 --> 45:30.003
I also have a plan.

45:30.125 --> 45:35.006
But you have not seen it
This plan with catapults and dry ice machines.

45:35.125 --> 45:38.709
- Two on one. Chester?
- Forget Chester.

45:38.875 --> 45:44.382
Are you crazy?
You should stay away from trouble.

45:51.250 --> 45:55.801
Doc right. No hope.
I've tried to persuade him.

45:56.000 --> 46:00.085
He was accustomed to the situation here.
He will not come out.

46:00.250 --> 46:05.802
But .. okay.
Listen this is what we do.

46:25.875 --> 46:30.005
Come on, champ!

46:34.875 --> 46:38.630
Can I have your autograph?

47:08.083 --> 47:13.635
12:30.
Number 12 in the match.

47:29.500 --> 47:35.086
-12.10.
- It took ten minutes to fill it.
What happen?

47:35.250 --> 47:40.051
102, 103! Come Champ ... Ayoo .. again ..

47:40.208 --> 47:43.508
Done Champ ... now 100 ...

48:04.750 --> 48:10.382
You've got a coach himself.
Here is the wardrobe itself.

48:10.542 --> 48:13.796
massage tables, shower and clean towels.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.002
And another thing that I ask for?

48:53.542 --> 48:59.299
It's no use. We are lost here.
We need a blueprint should use this place.

48:59.458 --> 49:02.917
I know where the goods it ..
In a place easily.

49:03.083 --> 49:07.759
In the office Grunts? How can we get in.
How do we find it?

49:07.917 --> 49:11.421
I know someone who can help us.
I can convince him.

49:11.583 --> 49:15.713
But do not worry, I can handle it.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.504
No, no. tidak..Sudah I say a thousand times, no.

49:25.667 --> 49:29.501
Can not you understand.
I do not want to interfere.

49:29.667 --> 49:36.130
Do you want me to beg you?
Please! Please!

49:37.917 --> 49:41.046
Listen, Gus.
Tau was: "Odyssey".

49:41.208 --> 49:45.258
It used to be crazy people out, half dead.

49:45.417 --> 49:51.834
We just borrow the key for 1 hour, go to the office,
take bluprint, we came out, and then return it to you.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.253
No one will ever know.

49:54.417 --> 49:57.011
Oh no. Grunt has the best smell in this prison.

49:57.167 --> 50:03.550
If he found one hair or
one set of footprints, I'd die.

50:03.708 --> 50:07.667
I've been with you a long herd.
I've been pretty begging you ...

50:07.833 --> 50:11.542
- I'm tired of this.
- Stop! We can get into trouble.

50:16.500 --> 50:21.427
- You're not going to get what you want to do that.
- Are you sure?

50:21.583 --> 50:25.918
I do not care about it.
Everything dries up sooner or later.

50:26.083 --> 50:33.342
Then this might be a second choice.
Get your attention.

50:33.500 --> 50:37.710
Okay, I'll help ..

50:45.167 --> 50:50.845
If I know this happens again, I'll make you
The next frame models!

51:33.667 --> 51:36.341
Watch Out.

51:36.500 --> 51:43.088
Grunt is a neat dog.
He organized.

52:12.042 --> 52:14.795
Why are you silent?

52:15.000 --> 52:19.676
They will arrest us, and
I'm too old.

52:25.167 --> 52:31.630
That's why you want to remain here.
You will see the sea again, friend.

52:43.458 --> 52:48.134
This is it, I got it.

52:48.292 --> 52:52.627
- Let's go outside.
- What do you mean get out, look at this mess?

52:52.792 --> 52:55.420
We need to clean it.

53:54.042 --> 54:00.459
Is completely clean, boss.
I cleaned too strong.

54:00.625 --> 54:02.719
Go away from here!

54:08.583 --> 54:10.585
What?

54:31.333 --> 54:33.427
He's coming.

54:36.333 --> 54:40.918
- Calm down.
- He came. What we will do?

54:44.875 --> 54:49.676
Do you mind, we need privacy.
We're training now.

54:53.000 --> 54:57.380
Doc! He goes.

54:59.875 --> 55:05.132
Ozzy! Ozzy! Ozzy!

55:28.750 --> 55:35.508
To the right.
Of course I'm sure.

55:45.042 --> 55:51.584
Okay, that's not true.
What do you expect with my eyes?

56:21.125 --> 56:26.677
Give me O! Give me Z!
Give me Z! Give me a Y!

56:26.833 --> 56:29.256
Ozzy! Ozzy!

56:32.792 --> 56:36.877
- What is that?
- He slips.

56:37.042 --> 56:39.670
You will regret this.

56:39.833 --> 56:43.883
- Is there something of a problem?
- Tackle patnerku subordinates.

56:44.042 --> 56:50.505
- Is that right, 463?
- No, I just slip.

56:50.667 --> 56:57.710
You may not be able to see clearly there, Vito.

56:59.750 --> 57:04.881
Vito, vito. you know will lose like last time.

57:05.042 --> 57:11.300
You create the hype and ended
in the hole, like last time.

57:11.458 --> 57:18.251
Patnerku will make your guys bite the dust.
We believe it.

57:18.417 --> 57:20.169
It's interesting.

57:20.333 --> 57:24.088
If we win, we
get a good meal.

57:24.250 --> 57:28.505
We would be allowed to see "Shall We Dance With Dog"
in the TV room again.

57:28.667 --> 57:32.092
And no one will be inserted into the hole for a month.

57:32.250 --> 57:38.508
Okay, but if you lose, you're
working two shifts and catfood.

57:38.667 --> 57:42.922
- And the TV stays off.
- Wait a minute

57:43.083 --> 57:49.921
And you're still here until the season
next spring. Do we agree?

58:02.125 --> 58:07.507
The welcome, the dog and the dog,
for an unforgettable evening.

58:07.667 --> 58:14.460
This day has come. Seizing Time for our fate.

58:27.292 --> 58:33.504
Have you come to say goodbye?
Hold me buddy.

58:33.667 --> 58:40.255
- Do you intend to participate in this madness?
- Yes, if you do not want to get in trouble, you'd better not be seen here.

58:40.417 --> 58:45.002
- Problems? I'll see what happens when you have escaped?
- Shhhh ... do not be loud!

58:45.125 --> 58:50.382
When you pass guard dogs
out there ...

58:50.542 --> 58:54.718
- It would be a nightmare.
- Now this alone would be a nightmare

58:56.333 --> 59:03.091
Listen. Imagine the risk if you're out.

59:03.250 --> 59:08.711
You only think about yourself
and always avoid problems.

59:08.875 --> 59:11.128
If you do not participate, go alone.

59:11.292 --> 59:15.547
-Do Not .. you can not escape.
- You did not say anything.

59:15.708 --> 59:18.257
You do not understand ...

59:23.250 --> 59:29.053
Nice, Doc. Sorry, Chester, but
we were risking ourselves.

59:29.208 --> 59:33.509
- No one can stop us.
- There is only one thing.

59:33.667 --> 59:37.592
Regarding escape.
I do not know if I can.

59:38.333 --> 59:42.793
Possible 00:50 ...

59:43.000 --> 59:48.086
No, we did not present "How
if we dance with the dog "today.

59:55.542 --> 01:00:01.879
Are your feet so cold?
Is that the plan? This plan?

01:00:02.042 --> 01:00:05.501
Forget the plan. What if Chester correct?

01:00:05.667 --> 01:00:08.420
Perhaps I really should go and win the game for them.
Are you serious?

01:00:08.583 --> 01:00:12.918
Let kuingatkankan you, you have to beat Vito and Lobo.

01:00:13.083 --> 01:00:16.713
Or all of which are trying to beat you there.

01:00:16.875 --> 01:00:23.212
I know, but what about the others?
They trust me. It's time to improve their lives.

01:00:23.375 --> 01:00:28.336
I also want to live better.
Doc also.

01:00:29.333 --> 01:00:34.134
All right, how do we take only the most votes.
Let voice determine.

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:41.631
The crowd is impatient.
They're ten minutes late.

01:00:41.792 --> 01:00:45.922
Where Ozzy?

01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:50.133
Lazy dog! Stick to your job!

01:01:01.417 --> 01:01:05.092
Where is he?
Who did it?

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:09.676
Searching for him to come out to the field, if
All you have to drag it out.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:13.633
We have the challenger! Rocket!

01:01:13.792 --> 01:01:20.050
The Beagle!
Galoppbisken! Locomotive 12 kilos!

01:01:26.417 --> 01:01:32.550
Can he change the record this record?
The champion did not seem worried.

01:02:16.708 --> 01:02:20.338
I have never seen this bleak game.

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:23.470
In definitely be a dream
bad for the dog.

01:02:23.625 --> 01:02:29.553
Jock kept the pace high, but Ozzy
really put a foot long for the first time.

01:02:32.167 --> 01:02:36.422
With it you can not ponimu
see your friend's defeat later ..

01:02:56.625 --> 01:03:01.005
What are you waiting for? Quick fix!

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:18.792
Find him and his friends.
If necessary, crawling all over the hostel.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.052
- They have been blocking the door. We can not get out.
- Open the door ... now!

01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:30.422
If anyone can explain what's this?

01:03:30.583 --> 01:03:34.008
- Where is Ozzy?
- Stay where you are.

01:03:43.833 --> 01:03:48.259
They are not here, boss. We'll keep looking.

01:04:08.125 --> 01:04:10.219
Hurry ...

01:04:08.125 --> 01:04:10.219
We're almost there.
We were not very well leave you there, buddy.

01:04:17.458 --> 01:04:20.052
We can talk later.

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:49.336
Divers tried to jump
with half somersault.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.923
Perfect.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:45.834
Now we are ready!

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.675
Ready to go.

01:05:49.833 --> 01:05:56.000
- Guys, Is everyone okay?
- Yes, we are successful.

01:05:56.125 --> 01:06:00.710
- What is wrong? Why are we stopping?
- Calm down. They just opened the gate.

01:06:00.875 --> 01:06:03.503
I so wanted to see the face of Deckers.

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:48.422
Please, do not punish Chester.
Actually, he did not want to participate.

01:06:48.583 --> 01:06:54.044
Naturally .. Tell me, old dog. Are you more
Like being in a hole or somewhere else?

01:06:54.208 --> 01:06:59.294
The complainant became popular today.

01:06:59.458 --> 01:07:03.588
Chester? What does it mean?

01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:09.302
I meet you to warn you.
You did not listen.

01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:13.338
Too many traces of oil that you left in the office.

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:16.379
Chester? How could you?

01:07:16.542 --> 01:07:19.796
They threatened to break the legs ahead of me.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.131
I could just stay here and avoid trouble.
Sorry.

01:07:25.292 --> 01:07:30.093
Sorry?
I'll break your front foot!

01:07:50.292 --> 01:07:55.423
Heii .. you do not, then the warden who will take care of you personally.

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:03.338
- Once that's done, my turn to go.
- Forget it, I'm used to.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:07.550
You calm down. Pity the child.

01:08:08.667 --> 01:08:11.090
He has guts.

01:08:14.625 --> 01:08:16.719
Anything else, sir?

01:08:16.875 --> 01:08:22.712
No, Decker. You can go.
I need the exercise.

01:08:23.875 --> 01:08:30.337
I told if I can not trust you,
You will see me again.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:36.006
- But see you dare ..
- All this is full of surprises.

01:08:36.125 --> 01:08:40.710
What a surprise this section you love to know?

01:08:40.875 --> 01:08:44.379
- Be careful, stupid!
- Sorry.

01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:48.091
Let there boy! You do not make it worse.

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:52.676
Do not move.
You must spend time making this.

01:08:52.832 --> 01:08:56.042
-I Say, do not move!

01:08:56.207 --> 01:08:58.426
Let's try again.

01:09:02.625 --> 01:09:06.584
I would prefer that he did not come in here.

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:11.426
Remain there, Decker!
Do not do apa2!

01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:17.795
We can forget your escape attempt.
I can do something for you? Freeing teman2mu?

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.550
I only ask one thing you can do for me.

01:09:23.332 --> 01:09:25.676
Get back!

01:09:38.042 --> 01:09:41.921
Why are you still there? Wake up, go after him!

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:48.792
What happened?

01:09:58.375 --> 01:10:03.586
- What are you doing, fool?
- No one anjingpun here.

01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:06.833
Close the door, and we get out of this place.

01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:17.553
One two. Do you hear me?
You know who I am.

01:10:17.708 --> 01:10:23.590
You must look at me today. I want you know, I do not regret what I did.

01:10:26.583 --> 01:10:30.133
I would do it again.
1001 times.

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:37.301
You must hate me because we did not win.
I was not even enter the competition, because the match was a hoax.

01:10:37.458 --> 01:10:40.257
Hoax?

01:10:40.417 --> 01:10:43.500
Why I did not hear anything about it?

01:10:43.667 --> 01:10:47.797
Even if Grunt does not
lost though, we are never going to win.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:55.009
They are definitely going to win, they made this hoax so that you can not be free.

01:10:55.167 --> 01:11:00.924
I do not forget who I am. I am not a champion. I'm not 463.

01:11:01.083 --> 01:11:03.461
My name is Ozzy!

01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:09.086
Did you forget who you all?
Where did you come from?

01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:12.424
So let me help you to remember it.

01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:38.585
- This is my necklace!
- This is mine!

01:11:49.917 --> 01:11:54.844
Sugar ??
Is that true? Your name is Sugar?

01:11:57.458 --> 01:12:00.302
Are there any issues about it?

01:12:02.083 --> 01:12:07.465
The kid's right.
It is time to unite.

01:12:56.167 --> 01:13:00.502
Do you think you can escape?

01:13:21.167 --> 01:13:25.377
- Let's get out of here!
- Where's the key?

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:35.926
What are you waiting for? Do something!

01:13:36.083 --> 01:13:39.007
Idiot, I always have to do everything myself?

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:44.797
Ready! ready! Shoot!

01:13:46.625 --> 01:13:50.129
Look at all the balls!

01:13:50.292 --> 01:13:56.800
- So many colors!
- Idiots! You do not have to take the ball!

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.549
Forget the ball!

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:26.008
Help me out of here! Wait for me.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.675
Good, boss. You're a tiger.

01:15:12.167 --> 01:15:15.797
Let me in!

01:15:18.583 --> 01:15:20.256
Dominic!

01:15:53.208 --> 01:15:59.375
Thank you buddy.
Hey, no action finally something!

01:16:00.583 --> 01:16:04.292
Do not just there, Come out.

01:16:04.458 --> 01:16:09.134
Come on, I need your help.
We do not have time during the day.

01:16:13.125 --> 01:16:18.507
Now, 463 is where we are now.

01:16:18.667 --> 01:16:22.467
You will not, you have to go through me first.

01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:47.084
With permission. Or without ijinmu.

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:11.006
Do you have any last requests?

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:31.302
- You missed ..
- Are you sure?

01:18:22.917 --> 01:18:26.717
Ok, now we're out of here.

01:18:26.875 --> 01:18:30.630
Who are you?
Where you been hiding all this time Chester?

01:18:30.792 --> 01:18:35.047
Hurry guys, The taxi will be leaving now.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.755
Vito, you're not coming?

01:18:47.917 --> 01:18:52.673
Of course, dear, but I have unfinished business here.

01:18:54.375 --> 01:18:57.345
Hey .. you can call me Sugar.

01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:34.754
We are now in the sea.

01:19:40.875 --> 01:19:43.845
- Look at that.
- Dogs are handsome.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.004
He seems familiar.

01:19:47.125 --> 01:19:51.301
Maybe my glasses need to be cleaned,
but what the dog was so handsome?

01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:53.552
Hey Doc, Look there.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:10.004
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you everywhere.

01:20:14.833 --> 01:20:20.260
Look, I've got ten stitches. Sick.
How about you?

01:20:20.417 --> 01:20:24.843
Now I understand why
she did not speak.

01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:35.881
Well this .. your house.
What yangkau wait ... Fronky?

01:20:38.875 --> 01:20:42.505
What are you doing? you're certainly not afraid of now?

01:20:42.667 --> 01:20:47.093
- It's not the nature of fear for dogs like you
- But, Bob must have been in my place with other dogs.

01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:51.460
He bought a new dog and
remember I certainly do not.

01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:56.552
No mungin, no one can forget.
You're a dog sucks the color electrically.

01:20:56.708 --> 01:21:01.214
Gabby?

01:21:08.042 --> 01:21:12.047
Gorgeous dogs ...

01:21:19.042 --> 01:21:22.171
What is wrong?

01:21:27.583 --> 01:21:34.125
Who is that? Wait a minute.
Long and breathless. Impossible

01:21:34.292 --> 01:21:37.501
Fronky?

01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:45.009
She seems berahkir as
escape artist.

01:21:53.792 --> 01:21:56.420
Well, this is the way to my house.

01:21:56.583 --> 01:21:59.917
- How about you? Do you have a plan?
- No.

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:06.716
But thank you for taking me out of there.
I had forgotten the fresh air in this place.

01:22:06.875 --> 01:22:09.298
Are you sure? You're going to be fine?

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.882
Of course. The old dog is always the way with his feet.
Almost.

01:22:17.042 --> 01:22:22.048
Thank you, Ozzy. Goodbye, my friend.

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:49.552
Ted, this is your cereal.
Paula, bread panggangmu.

01:23:04.708 --> 01:23:07.257
Ozzy? You're alive!

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:22.379
Hey, where are you going?

01:23:27.583 --> 01:23:31.417
But how? Who?

01:23:31.583 --> 01:23:35.793
A dog? Forget it.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.086
Tell me something, Susan.
No, do not look at me like that.

01:23:41.250 --> 01:23:46.006
No..
He can not stay here. Point.

01:23:49.333 --> 01:23:53.543
<I> Nathaniel Robinson punished
