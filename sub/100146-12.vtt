WEBVTT

00:34.490 --> 00:36.410
OLIVIA'S VOICE: HELP!

00:36.410 --> 00:41.160
SOMEBODY, PLEASE!
NO, NO!

00:41.160 --> 00:43.080
HOW'S IT
LOOKING, DOC?

00:43.080 --> 00:45.420
IT'S HEALING NICELY.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.880
LIFT UP YOUR ARM.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.510
CAN YOU GO HIGHER?

00:51.510 --> 00:53.680
DR. SHAW: HOW'S THAT FEEL?
SPENCER: FINE.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.930
HOW'S IT REALLY FEEL?

00:55.930 --> 00:57.180
THERE'S SOME PAIN.

00:57.180 --> 00:58.220
WELL, THERE
SHOULD BE.

00:58.220 --> 00:59.600
IT'S ONLY BEEN
A MONTH.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.720
BUT I AM VERY PLEASED

01:00.720 --> 01:02.520
WITH YOUR PROGRESS
SO FAR.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.270
YEAH? SO, HOW LONG
TILL I CAN

01:04.270 --> 01:06.190
PLAY FOOTBALL AGAIN?

01:06.190 --> 01:07.610
FOOTBALL IS
THE LAST THING

01:07.610 --> 01:09.360
YOU SHOULD BE
THINKING ABOUT.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.070
I KNOW, BUT
IT'S ACTUALLY

01:11.070 --> 01:13.070
ALL I CAN
THINK ABOUT.

01:13.070 --> 01:14.400
I MEAN, THE WHOLE POINT
OF THE SURGERY WAS

01:14.400 --> 01:16.320
GETTING ME BACK
ON THE FIELD, RIGHT?

01:16.320 --> 01:18.070
YOU'RE NOT READY
TO PLAY JUST YET,

01:18.070 --> 01:20.290
BUT YOU ARE CLEARED
FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY.

01:20.290 --> 01:23.000
JUST KEEP IT LOW-IMPACT.
LIGHT WEIGHTS.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.790
SWIMMING'S GOOD.
DON'T WORRY.

01:24.790 --> 01:26.330
YOU'LL PLAY AGAIN.

01:26.330 --> 01:27.710
WILL I BE
AS GOOD AS I WAS?

01:27.710 --> 01:29.540
IT WAS A VERY SERIOUS
INJURY, SPENCER.

01:29.540 --> 01:31.420
YOUR BODY HAS TO HEAL.

01:31.420 --> 01:32.840
AND RIGHT NOW, YOUR
RANGE OF MOTION IS

01:32.840 --> 01:35.380
PROBABLY
ONLY ABOUT 70%.

01:35.380 --> 01:36.970
SO YOU'RE SAYING NO.

01:36.970 --> 01:39.140

PRACTICE.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.510
JORDAN: YO, ASH,
YOU GOOD?

02:22.510 --> 02:24.180
HEY, J.J., YOU NEED
TO TIGHTEN UP
YOUR DEFENSE, BRO.

02:24.180 --> 02:25.520
I'M SCHOOLING YOU
EVERY PLAY.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.140
LOOK, I DON'T NEED YOU
COACHING ME.

02:27.140 --> 02:29.100
ASHER: AM I THE ONLY ONE
PUTTING IN WORK HERE?

02:30.270 --> 02:32.020
BILLY: ASH, BRING IT IN!

02:34.530 --> 02:36.030
CHILL OUT FOR
A FEW PLAYS.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.200
NO, COACH, I'M GOOD.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.400
I CAN APPRECIATE
YOUR ENERGY,

02:38.400 --> 02:39.820
BUT YOU ARE
ANNOYING THE CRAP

02:39.820 --> 02:41.870
OUT OF YOUR TEAMMATES,
SO COOL OUT.

02:52.790 --> 02:55.170
ALL RIGHT. RELAX.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

02:55.170 --> 02:56.210
BACK TO WORK!

02:57.720 --> 03:00.890
ALL RIGHT.
SO HOW'D IT GO?

03:00.890 --> 03:03.140
PRETTY GOOD. YEAH.

03:03.140 --> 03:05.310
DOC CLEARED ME FOR
PHYSICAL THERAPY.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.560
LOW-IMPACT STUFF,
SWIMMING.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.140
SO I GUESS I'LL
BE USING YOUR
POOL A WHOLE LOT.

03:09.140 --> 03:12.150
ALL RIGHT. WHAT ELSE?

03:12.150 --> 03:14.230
HE DON'T THINK I'M
READY TO PLAY BALL
YET, THOUGH.

03:14.230 --> 03:15.230
HUH.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.280
BUT I FIGURED
SINCE HE CLEARED
ME FOR PT,

03:18.280 --> 03:19.530
I CAN JUST
PLAY THROUGH THE
SORENESS, RIGHT?

03:19.530 --> 03:21.240
MM. NAH, I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT THAT.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.740
COME ON, COACH. LOOK.
I CAN JUST

03:22.740 --> 03:24.370
RUN MY ROUTES
AND STAY SHARP. WHAT?

03:24.370 --> 03:25.830
WHAT'S THE RUSH?
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

03:25.830 --> 03:28.040
YOU JUST FINISH OUT
YOUR PHYSICAL THERAPY.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.750
ONCE THEY CLEAR YOU
TO PLAY AGAIN,

03:29.750 --> 03:32.000
YOU GOT THE STARTING SPOT
WAITING HERE FOR YOU.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.420
SPENCER:
AND WHAT DO I TELL
THE COLLEGE COACHES

03:33.420 --> 03:34.710
ON MY RECRUITING TRIPS?

03:34.710 --> 03:36.500
YOU AIN'T GOTTA
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.630
LET'S JUST GET
YOUR BODY RIGHT.

03:38.630 --> 03:40.930
I'LL REACH OUT.
I'LL REACH OUT
TO THE SCHOOLS.

03:40.930 --> 03:42.550
WHY YOU GOTTA WORRY
ABOUT THAT?

03:42.550 --> 03:43.800
I THOUGHT THEY WAS
CALLING ABOUT ME.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.260
THEY WERE, THEY WERE,
BUT, UH,

03:46.260 --> 03:48.100
YOU KNOW, THE SHOOTING
HAPPENED, SO--

03:48.100 --> 03:50.600
SPENCER: THEY BACKED OFF?
BILLY: LOOK, FOR NOW.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.900
LET'S JUST GET YOU
HEALTHY, ALL RIGHT?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.440
THEN WE CAN SHOW THEM
YOU'RE THE SAME PLAYER

03:54.440 --> 03:56.150
YOU WERE LAST SEASON.

04:08.060 --> 04:11.400
♪ LET ME SHINE ON YOU... ♪

04:11.400 --> 04:13.900
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

04:13.900 --> 04:16.030
UM, I'VE BEEN TALKING
TO THE COUNSELOR

04:16.030 --> 04:19.200
A COUPLE DAYS A WEEK
SINCE THE, YOU KNOW...

04:19.200 --> 04:22.910
YEAH. I LOVE MS. BAILEY.
SHE'S GREAT.

04:22.910 --> 04:24.870
YEAH, I HAVEN'T BEEN
SLEEPING MUCH LATELY.

04:24.870 --> 04:27.120
SHE LETS ME RAMBLE ON
AS LONG AS I WANT.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.370
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A DRY RUN FOR MY
PODCAST MATERIAL.

04:29.370 --> 04:32.630
OH, I LISTENED
TO THE LATEST EPISODE
OF YOUR PODCAST.

04:32.630 --> 04:35.920
SO GOOD.
JUST KEEPS GETTING
BETTER AND BETTER, LIV.

04:35.920 --> 04:39.340
THANKS. WAIT.
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

04:39.340 --> 04:40.970
UH, EXTRA CREDIT.

04:40.970 --> 04:42.640
I'M STILL TRYING
TO DIG MYSELF OUT OF

04:42.640 --> 04:45.100
THAT HOLE I DUG
WHEN I SKIPPED
ALL THOSE CLASSES.

04:45.100 --> 04:46.640
YEAH. WELL, AT LEAST
YOU SEEM HAPPY.

04:46.640 --> 04:49.100
I'M JUST LOOKING FORWARD
TO WHAT'S NEXT FOR ME.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.600
ANY IDEAS?

04:50.600 --> 04:52.940
UH, YEAH,
ACTUALLY. UM,

04:52.940 --> 04:54.610
CAN'T DENY THE FACT
THAT MUSIC'S IN MY BLOOD,

04:54.610 --> 04:56.070
AND I ALWAYS
THOUGHT IT'D BE

04:56.070 --> 04:57.900
SONGWRITING BECAUSE
OF MY MOM,

04:57.900 --> 04:59.570
BUT I ACTUALLY HAVE
A KNACK FOR PRODUCING

04:59.570 --> 05:02.700
LIKE MY DAD,
SO JUST WORKING ON
SOME NEW STUFF.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.120
I MEAN, THAT'S
REALLY GREAT, LAYLA.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.080
AND WHENEVER YOU'RE
READY TO SHARE
SOME OF THAT MUSIC,

05:07.080 --> 05:08.870
I'VE GOT AT
LEAST 50 PEOPLE

05:08.870 --> 05:10.210
WILLING TO
LISTEN TO IT.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.710
LAYLA: 50?
OLIVIA: 50.

05:11.710 --> 05:13.040
FIVE-ZERO OR ONE-FIVE?

05:13.040 --> 05:15.670
-FIVE-ZERO.
-WOW!

05:15.670 --> 05:17.550
COOP: HEY, Y'ALL GOT
TVs IN HERE?

05:17.550 --> 05:19.010
PREACH: YUP.

05:19.010 --> 05:20.340
WHAT YOU WATCHING?

05:20.340 --> 05:22.590
-HOME MAKEOVER SHOWS.
-WHY?

05:22.590 --> 05:24.260
I DON'T PICK
THE CHANNELS.

05:24.260 --> 05:25.720
IT'S JUST ON.
EITHER YOU WATCH IT
OR YOU DON'T.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.220
BESIDES,
I'M MOSTLY DOING

05:27.220 --> 05:29.730
WHAT I DID THE LAST
TIME I WAS IN HERE,

05:29.730 --> 05:30.890
READING BOOKS.

05:30.890 --> 05:32.440
WHAT YOU READING?

05:32.440 --> 05:34.520
COOP, WHAT YOU
DOING HERE?

05:34.520 --> 05:36.400
I'M JUST CHECKING IN
ON YOU.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.110
YOU AIN'T GOTTA
VISIT ME THAT MUCH.
I'M GOOD.

05:39.110 --> 05:41.030
LOOK, I DO NOT MIND.

05:41.030 --> 05:43.280
I ACTUALLY LIKE HAVING
SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

05:43.280 --> 05:46.030
I AIN'T SEEN PATIENCE
IN I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG,

05:46.030 --> 05:47.990
AND EVER SINCE
THAT SHOOTING,

05:47.990 --> 05:49.750
I'VE BEEN
DODGING SPENCER.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.080
WHY?

05:52.080 --> 05:54.290
'CAUSE I'M THE REASON
HE GOT SHOT.

05:54.290 --> 05:58.130
THAT WAS ALL TYRONE,
NOT YOU.

05:58.130 --> 06:00.340
DON'T PUT THAT
ON YOURSELF.

06:00.340 --> 06:03.630
OH, AIN'T NOBODY SEEN
TYRONE IN OVER A MONTH.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.180
BUT DON'T WORRY.
WHENEVER HE DO DECIDE
TO SHOW UP,

06:06.180 --> 06:07.350
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE
OF HIM.

06:07.350 --> 06:08.970
FOR YOU
AND FOR SPENCER.

06:08.970 --> 06:11.770
I GOT PEOPLE TO
TAKE CARE OF THAT FOOL.

06:11.770 --> 06:13.560
YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

06:15.060 --> 06:17.230
SO WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THIS MUSIC?

06:17.230 --> 06:20.110
MAN, THAT IS NOT
IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW.

06:20.110 --> 06:21.650
SO THAT'S IT, HUH?

06:21.650 --> 06:24.240
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE AWAY
YOUR WHOLE FUTURE,

06:24.240 --> 06:25.950
WAITING AROUND FOR TYRONE
SO YOU CAN DO

06:25.950 --> 06:27.950
SOMETHING STUPID
THAT'LL PUT YOU

06:27.950 --> 06:29.990
RIGHT HERE WHERE I AM.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.410
I HOPE YOU LIKE
HOME MAKEOVER SHOWS.

06:40.840 --> 06:43.720
SPENCER: COACH WILSON. HI.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.510
SPENCER.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

06:45.510 --> 06:47.510
-HOW YOU FEELING, SON?
-GOOD. GOOD.

06:47.510 --> 06:49.140
THEY CLEARED ME
FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY,

06:49.140 --> 06:51.270
SO I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET BACK ON
THAT FIELD.

06:51.270 --> 06:52.600
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD
TO WATCHING YOU PLAY
AGAIN THIS FALL.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.930
I'M GLAD TO HEAR
THAT, COACH.

06:53.930 --> 06:55.560
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE STOPPING BY.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.060
DARNELL: LET ME KNOW
IF YOU NEED MORE ICE.

06:57.060 --> 06:58.810
-OH. WHAT'S UP, SPENCE?
-WHAT'S UP, MAN?

06:58.810 --> 07:01.940
I'M HERE FOR
A HOME VISIT WITH DARNELL.

07:01.940 --> 07:05.030
UCLA JUST OFFERED ME
A SCHOLARSHIP, BRO.

07:05.030 --> 07:06.910
THAT'S GREAT, MAN.
CONGRATULATIONS.

07:06.910 --> 07:08.370
DARNELL:
APPRECIATE THAT.

07:08.370 --> 07:09.370
I'M GONNA TAKE
AN UNOFFICIAL VISIT

07:09.370 --> 07:10.700
TO CAMPUS TOMORROW.

07:10.700 --> 07:13.660
YO, WE BOTH
GOT OFFERS NOW.

07:13.660 --> 07:16.000
YOU SHOULD COME, TOO.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.620
YOU SHOULD, SPENCER.

07:19.130 --> 07:21.170
ALL RIGHT.
I'M IN. LET'S DO IT.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.240
HEY, DON'T DRINK
ALL THE O.J.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.990
SAVE SOME FOR ME
IN THE MORNING.

07:53.530 --> 07:55.240
WHAT YOU DOING UP SO LATE?

07:55.240 --> 07:57.410
I HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO SLEEP MUCH

07:57.410 --> 07:58.830
SINCE THE SHOOTING,

07:58.830 --> 08:01.080
SO I USUALLY
JUST SIT HERE

08:01.080 --> 08:02.340
MOST OF
THE NIGHT.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.170
DOES IT HELP?

08:05.170 --> 08:07.630
STRANGELY, YES.

08:07.630 --> 08:10.130
IT'S QUIET.
AND NO JORDAN.

08:10.130 --> 08:12.760
BEST TIME
TO THINK.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.260
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?

08:14.260 --> 08:16.430
EVERYTHING.

08:16.430 --> 08:18.100
I MEAN, WHEN SOMETHING
LIKE THAT HAPPENS,

08:18.100 --> 08:20.690
IT MAKES YOU REEVALUATE
YOUR ENTIRE FUTURE.

08:20.690 --> 08:21.770
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

08:24.820 --> 08:27.490
I'M, UH, I'M VISITING
UCLA TOMORROW.

08:27.490 --> 08:29.860
THAT'S GREAT.

08:29.860 --> 08:32.070
OR IS THAT THE
REASON YOU'RE UP?

08:32.070 --> 08:33.780
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST--

08:33.780 --> 08:36.040
WHAT IF THEY CHANGE
THEIR MINDS?

08:36.040 --> 08:38.000
WHEN THEY OFFERED ME
A SCHOLARSHIP,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.250
I WAS THE 57TH-RANKED
PLAYER IN THE COUNTRY.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.750
I'M NOT
THAT PLAYER NO MORE.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.500
YEAH, BUT YOU WILL BE
ONCE YOU HEAL.

08:45.380 --> 08:46.630
THE DOCTOR DOESN'T KNOW
IF I'LL EVER GET

08:46.630 --> 08:48.380
TO THAT LEVEL AGAIN.

08:48.380 --> 08:49.840
SAYS ONLY TIME WILL TELL.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.220
SO LET TIME
DO ITS THING.

08:52.220 --> 08:53.640
AND WHILE YOU'RE WAITING,
JUST KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS

08:53.640 --> 08:55.680
A SPOT NEXT TO ME
ON THIS COUCH.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.970
SAME TIME

09:52.860 --> 09:55.280
LOOK, WE'RE DONE,
ALL RIGHT?

09:55.280 --> 09:56.620
I'M GOOD.
I'M GOOD.

09:56.620 --> 09:58.160
NO. MY DAD SAID
YOU WEREN'T CLEARED

09:58.160 --> 09:59.740
FOR PRACTICE, ALL RIGHT?
I SHOULD'VE LISTENED.

09:59.740 --> 10:00.790
THE PAIN IS NOT
THE PROBLEM, ALL RIGHT?

10:00.790 --> 10:02.790
AAH. MY REACH IS GONE.

10:02.790 --> 10:04.370
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO TELL THE COACHES
AT THIS VISIT?

10:04.370 --> 10:06.080
NOTHING. I'D LET
YOUR BODY FULLY HEAL

10:06.080 --> 10:07.750
BEFORE YOU TELL THEM
ANYTHING.

10:07.750 --> 10:08.880
JUST GO AND ENJOY
THE VISIT.

10:08.880 --> 10:10.590
YOU'VE EARNED IT,
SPENCE.

10:10.590 --> 10:12.130
I WOULDN'T HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT TO DO

10:12.130 --> 10:14.050
IF A SCHOOL LIKE THAT
OFFERED ME A FULL RIDE.

10:14.050 --> 10:16.260
-YOUR TIME WILL COME, MAN.
-MAYBE.

10:16.260 --> 10:19.100
I'VE JUST BEEN
SO CONSUMED WITH FAMILY
DRAMA AND SIMONE THAT--

10:19.100 --> 10:21.350
MAYBE WITH A BIG
SENIOR SEASON.

10:21.350 --> 10:23.890
YOU SHOULD COME
WITH ME TODAY.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.560
I'M ALLOWED TO BRING
A TEAMMATE.

10:25.560 --> 10:28.690
I WANT YOU THERE.
AND WHO KNOWS?

10:28.690 --> 10:30.730
MAYBE THAT WILL
REMIND YOU WHAT
TO STRIVE FOR.

10:39.530 --> 10:41.410
IF YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT MY PARENTS
WALKING IN ON US,

10:41.410 --> 10:43.290
THEY'RE BOTH GONNA BE
GONE ALL MORNING.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.340
SORRY.

10:55.010 --> 10:57.720
I'VE GOT MY
WEEKLY BREAKFAST
WITH MY MOM.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.390
DO YOU NOT WANT TO GO?

10:59.390 --> 11:00.810
SHE'S MAKING AN EFFORT,

11:00.810 --> 11:02.350
SO I MIGHT AS WELL
GIVE HER A CHANCE.

11:02.350 --> 11:05.230
SO IF IT'S NOT THAT,
THEN WHAT IS IT?

11:05.230 --> 11:08.810
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
THAT YOUR DAD SAID
AT PRACTICE.

11:08.810 --> 11:10.520
HE TOLD SPENCER
AS SOON AS HE'S
HEALED UP,

11:10.520 --> 11:12.190
HIS STARTING SPOT'S
WAITING FOR HIM.

11:12.190 --> 11:14.400
BUT THAT'S MY SPOT.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.400
I'VE BEEN PLAYING
THE BEST FOOTBALL
OF MY LIFE.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.280
WHAT MORE DO I HAVE
TO DO TO PROVE MYSELF?

11:18.280 --> 11:19.570
YOU CAN STILL BE A STAR

11:19.570 --> 11:21.240
WITH SPENCER
ON THE FIELD.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.040
I MEAN, AS LONG AS
YOU'RE PLAYING WELL,

11:23.040 --> 11:24.790
SCOUTS WILL NOTICE.

11:24.790 --> 11:27.250
JUST KEEP
WORKING HARD.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.750
I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH HARDER

11:28.750 --> 11:30.380
I CAN PUSH
MYSELF, LIV.

11:33.130 --> 11:35.260
COOP: YEAH, PROBABLY
ONE OF THESE DAYS.

11:39.470 --> 11:41.220
Y'ALL JUST GONNA LEAVE?

11:41.220 --> 11:42.720
MAN: PEACE.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.850
PSH. ALL RIGHT.
WELL, HIT ME LATER.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.940
HA HA!
OH, LAYLA.

11:48.940 --> 11:51.270
LOOKS YOUR FRIENDS
DON'T LIKE ME
VERY MUCH.

11:51.270 --> 11:52.690
OH, YOU FORGOT
YOU THE GIRL THAT

11:52.690 --> 11:54.530
ALMOST TOOK BIG HOMEY
DEUCE'S HEAD OFF.

11:54.530 --> 11:56.110
OH, I DID
FORGET ABOUT THAT.

11:56.110 --> 11:58.450
YEAH. THEY DIDN'T.
SO WHAT'S UP?

11:58.450 --> 12:01.370
WELL, I JUST WANTED
TO TALK.

12:01.370 --> 12:03.280
SPENCER SAYS HE HASN'T
SEEN YOU IN A WHILE.

12:03.280 --> 12:06.750
YEAH, MAN.
I'VE BEEN SUPER BUSY.

12:06.750 --> 12:09.670
BUSY LIKE WORKING ON
NEW LYRICS?

12:09.670 --> 12:11.290
NO. I AIN'T REALLY
BEEN MESSING

12:11.290 --> 12:12.790
WITH THE MUSIC THING
NO MORE.

12:12.790 --> 12:16.590
BEEN DEALING WITH SOME
MORE IMPORTANT STUFF.

12:16.590 --> 12:19.050
OK, WELL,
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT

12:19.050 --> 12:20.930
WE COULD COLLABORATE
ON SOMETHING.

12:20.930 --> 12:23.930
I RECORDED A NEW BEAT
I THINK YOU'D LIKE.

12:23.930 --> 12:25.390
CAN I PLAY IT FOR YOU?

12:25.390 --> 12:26.930
AND IF I SAY NO,
YOU GONNA PLAY IT ANYWAY?

12:26.930 --> 12:28.060
YUP.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.820
OH, THAT'S DOPE.

12:39.820 --> 12:41.610
THOUGHT YOUR DAD
DIDN'T WANT
TO WORK WITH ME.

12:41.610 --> 12:43.490
WELL, THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH HIM.

12:43.490 --> 12:45.410
LOOK, I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU WERE SPECIAL, COOP,

12:45.410 --> 12:46.910
AND I STAND BY THAT.

12:46.910 --> 12:48.370
PLUS, I'VE BEEN
THINKING A LOT MORE

12:48.370 --> 12:49.910
ABOUT MY FUTURE,
AND I THINK I'D BE

12:49.910 --> 12:51.870
REALLY GOOD AT
PRODUCING MUSIC.

12:51.870 --> 12:53.880
AND YOU CAN HELP ME
PROVE IT,

12:53.880 --> 12:55.460
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

12:55.460 --> 12:56.920
-LAYLA, I DON'T--
-LOOK, COOP,

12:56.920 --> 12:58.630
YOU'D REALLY BE
HELPING ME OUT.

12:58.630 --> 13:01.930
AND ALL THAT MORE
IMPORTANT STUFF,

13:01.930 --> 13:03.260
CAN IT WAIT?

13:05.470 --> 13:07.680
ASHER: I BASICALLY HAVE
TO LIVE IN THE GYM THIS YEAR.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.480
GWEN: WELL, THAT SOUNDS
A LITTLE EXCESSIVE.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.980
IF I WANT COLLEGE
COACHES TO NOTICE ME,

13:11.980 --> 13:13.480
I GOTTA PASS
THE EYE TEST.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.520
BUT YOU HAVE
PERFECT EYESIGHT.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.940
NO. THE "EYE TEST"

13:15.940 --> 13:17.190
IS WHEN THEY LOOK
AT YOU AND THEY SEE

13:17.190 --> 13:18.480
A D-I PLAYER.

13:18.480 --> 13:19.990
I ALSO HAVE TO HIT
MY TARGET STATS.

13:19.990 --> 13:21.950
GWEN: WHICH ARE?
ASHER: 70, MINIMUM.

13:21.950 --> 13:23.030
70 WHAT?

13:23.030 --> 13:24.070
CATCHES NEXT SEASON.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.370
THAT'S A LOFTY GOAL.

13:25.370 --> 13:27.450
IT'S NOT A GOAL.
IT'S A GUARANTEE.

13:27.450 --> 13:28.990
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN DO IT?

13:28.990 --> 13:30.960
NO, I JUST THINK
THAT MAYBE
YOU'RE PUTTING

13:30.960 --> 13:32.500
A LITTLE
TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON
YOURSELF, THAT'S ALL.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.790
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GIVE YOUR BODY A REST.

13:33.790 --> 13:35.790
HAVE YOU NOT
BEEN LISTENING?

13:35.790 --> 13:37.290
I HAVE, AND YOU'RE
SAYING A LOT OF WORDS
REALLY FAST.

13:37.290 --> 13:38.800
YEAH, I'M FOCUSED.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.380
IS THAT ALL IT IS?

13:40.380 --> 13:41.970
BECAUSE I NOTICED
IN PRACTICE, YOU WERE

13:41.970 --> 13:43.430
STRUGGLING TO BREATHE
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

13:45.220 --> 13:46.890
WHAT WAS THAT?

13:46.890 --> 13:48.470
I WAS CATCHING
MY BREATH.

13:48.470 --> 13:49.850
IT'S JUST
I HAVE ATTENDED

13:49.850 --> 13:51.350
QUITE A FEW
PRACTICES LATELY,

13:51.350 --> 13:54.850
AND YOUR PROGRESS
HAS BEEN DRAMATIC.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.570
SOME MIGHT EVEN
CALL IT SUSPICIOUS.

13:58.570 --> 14:00.360
ASHER: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
GWEN: I'M JUST SAYING

14:00.360 --> 14:02.110
THAT YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN ACTING LIKE
YOURSELF LATELY.

14:02.110 --> 14:03.400
YEAH, AND HOW WOULD
YOU KNOW, MOM?

14:03.400 --> 14:04.860
LOOK, YOU ABANDONED
ME FOR A YEAR

14:04.860 --> 14:06.200
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
WANT YOUR FRIENDS

14:06.200 --> 14:08.780
TO FIND OUT THAT
YOU WERE AN ESCORT.

14:08.780 --> 14:12.250
MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T
KNOW ME ANYMORE, MOM.

14:12.250 --> 14:14.420
-LOOK, I GOTTA GO.
-NO, ASHER.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.540
PLEASE STAY.

14:16.540 --> 14:17.840
COME ON.
SIT DOWN.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.430
OK, SO MAYBE I
DON'T KNOW YOU

14:24.430 --> 14:25.760
THE WAY I USED TO.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.640
BUT THAT'S WHY
WE'RE HERE.

14:27.640 --> 14:29.720
LOOK, I'M SORRY
I SAID ANYTHING.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.560
LET'S JUST FINISH
OUR BREAKFAST, OK?

14:36.650 --> 14:38.900
DARNELL: IS IT
MY TURN TO TALK NOW?

14:38.900 --> 14:40.270
WOMAN: YOU DON'T
GET A VOTE.

14:40.270 --> 14:41.940
OK, SO I HAVE
NO SAY IN MY FUTURE?

14:41.940 --> 14:43.610
EXCUSE ME?
SINCE WHEN DO YOU

14:43.610 --> 14:44.780
RAISE YOUR VOICE
AT ME?

14:44.780 --> 14:46.240
SPENCER:
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:46.240 --> 14:49.160
SPENCER, THIS IS RENEE--
DARNELL'S MOM.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.950
RENEE, THAT'S MY BOY
AND HIS FRIEND JORDAN.

14:51.950 --> 14:54.000
DARNELL: SHE'S HERE TO TAKE ME
BACK TO GERMANY WITH HER.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.540
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO COME HOME.

14:55.540 --> 14:58.920
THAT'S NOT MY HOME, MA.
I AIN'T GOING.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.590
I'M JUST GONNA
WAIT IN THE CAR.

15:00.590 --> 15:02.550
DARNELL: NO. WE'RE ALL LEAVING.
RENEE: SIT DOWN.

15:02.550 --> 15:03.760
WE ARE NOT
FINISHED HERE.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.380
DARNELL:
YEAH, WE ARE.

15:05.380 --> 15:08.430
RENEE: HUH?
DARNELL: UH, LET'S GO, BRO.

15:08.430 --> 15:09.760
RENEE: DARNELL,

15:09.760 --> 15:12.350
YOU BETTER TURN AROUND.
DARNELL?

15:14.140 --> 15:18.940
YOUR BOY'S GOT
A BIG UCLA VISIT
TO GET TO. GO.

15:18.940 --> 15:20.150
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

15:20.150 --> 15:21.900
RENEE: EXCUSE ME?

15:21.900 --> 15:23.780
GRACE, SOFTLY: GO.
SPENCER: YES, MA'AM.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.880
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO GET INVOLVED.

15:41.880 --> 15:45.510
I HAD EVERY RIGHT.
THIS IS MY HOUSE.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.510
DID YOU HEAR THE BASS
IN HIS VOICE?

15:55.310 --> 15:56.810
HE SOUNDED UPSET.

15:56.810 --> 15:58.600
HE WAS DOWNRIGHT
DISRESPECTFUL.

15:58.600 --> 15:59.940
DARNELL HAS NEVER

15:59.940 --> 16:01.810
TALKED BACK TO ME
LIKE THAT.

16:01.810 --> 16:03.570
HE MUST'VE PICKED UP
THIS NEW ATTITUDE
RECENTLY.

16:03.570 --> 16:06.610
LOOK, RENEE,

16:06.610 --> 16:08.990
I AM NOT GONNA
JUSTIFY HIS BEHAVIOR.

16:08.990 --> 16:10.490
THEN DON'T.

16:10.490 --> 16:12.490
I'M JUST SAYING

16:12.490 --> 16:14.990
DARNELL HAS
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
OPPORTUNITY

16:14.990 --> 16:17.950
TO PLAY FOOTBALL
AT A MAJOR COLLEGE.

16:17.950 --> 16:19.750
MOVING OVERSEAS
MIGHT AFFECT THAT.

16:19.750 --> 16:22.830
HE'S MY SON.
I KNOW WHAT'S
BEST FOR HIM.

16:22.830 --> 16:25.500
I'VE BEEN EXACTLY
WHERE YOU ARE.

16:25.500 --> 16:28.670
LAST YEAR, I AGREED
TO LET SPENCER

16:28.670 --> 16:30.880
MOVE TO BEVERLY HILLS
TO PLAY FOOTBALL.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.470
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST
DIFFICULT DECISIONS

16:32.470 --> 16:34.430
I EVER HAD TO MAKE,

16:34.430 --> 16:36.350
BUT I DID IT
FOR HIS FUTURE.

16:36.350 --> 16:38.640
AND HE STILL ENDED UP
GETTING HURT.

16:41.020 --> 16:43.400
LISTEN, I'VE BEEN
GIVING YOU A PASS,

16:43.400 --> 16:46.020
BUT THAT AIN'T GONNA
LAST MUCH LONGER.

16:46.020 --> 16:47.900
MY POINT IS

16:47.900 --> 16:49.280
YOU CAN'T PROTECT
YOUR CHILDREN

16:49.280 --> 16:51.070
WHEN THEY'RE
NOT WITH YOU.

16:51.070 --> 16:52.990
I'M JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT MY BOY.

16:52.990 --> 16:54.660
I KNOW.
DARNELL IS ONE OF

16:54.660 --> 16:57.160
THE BEST YOUNG MEN
I HAVE EVER MET,

16:57.160 --> 16:59.660
AND THAT'S
BECAUSE OF YOU.

16:59.660 --> 17:01.370
BUT MAYBE
YOU SHOULD GIVE HIM

17:01.370 --> 17:03.250
A VOTE IN
HIS OWN FUTURE.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.520
DARNELL: MAN, SHE HAD
HER MIND MADE

17:19.520 --> 17:21.520
BEFORE SHE
GOT HERE, BRO.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.650
SHE WON'T EVEN
HEAR MY SIDE.

17:23.650 --> 17:25.100
CAN'T BE EASY
FOR HER, MAN.

17:25.100 --> 17:26.310
FOR HER?

17:26.310 --> 17:28.150
HAVING A KID
ACROSS THE OCEAN.

17:28.150 --> 17:30.440
YO, I THOUGHT YOU HAD
MY BACK ON THIS.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.570
I DO, MAN.
I WANT YOU TO STAY.

17:32.570 --> 17:34.780
I'M JUST SAYING
I SEE HER SIDE.

17:34.780 --> 17:36.200
LOOK, SHE LEFT YOU
WITH COREY.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.120
THAT'S SOMEBODY
SHE KNEW AND TRUSTED.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.240
SHE DON'T KNOW MY MOMS.
WE'RE ALL JUST
STRANGERS TO HER.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.870
-YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN--
-YOU'RE NOT LISTEN--

17:41.870 --> 17:43.410
WILSON: HEY, GUYS,
HOW'S THE TOUR GOING?

17:43.410 --> 17:45.080
DARNELL: GOOD. GOOD.
SPENCER: YEAH.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.540
'CAUSE IT SEEMS
LIKE YOU'RE MISSING
MOST OF IT.

17:46.540 --> 17:47.710
WE CAN DO IT
ANOTHER DAY
IF YOU GUYS--

17:47.710 --> 17:49.250
NO, NO, SIR.
NO, SIR.

17:49.250 --> 17:50.510
JORDAN: YO, DID YOU GUYS
KNOW THEY USED TO HAVE

17:50.510 --> 17:51.630
A LIVE BEAR MASCOT
AT HOME GAMES?

17:51.630 --> 17:52.840
THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.010
YEAH, BUT
YOU GUYS MIGHT

17:54.010 --> 17:55.220
BRING IT BACK,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

17:55.220 --> 17:57.100
NO. SHALL WE
CONTINUE?

17:57.100 --> 17:58.930
YEAH. YEAH.

AWAY FROM ALL THIS.

18:42.930 --> 18:46.100
MY BODY WANTS
TO TAKE ME AWAY
FROM ALL THIS.

18:46.100 --> 18:48.400
WE CAN'T LET EITHER
OF THOSE THINGS
HAPPEN, MAN.

18:52.570 --> 18:54.150
JORDAN: THIS PLACE
IS SICK.

18:54.150 --> 18:56.530
BRUIN: THIS IS PRETTY MUCH
WHERE I LIVE.

18:56.530 --> 18:58.360
SO HOW'D YOU FIND
YOUR FRESHMAN YEAR?

18:58.360 --> 19:00.490
WASN'T EASY.
A LOT OF HARD WORK,

19:00.490 --> 19:02.700
GRINDING EVERY DAY,
CLIMBING
THE DEPTH CHART.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.750
YEAH, I WAS BEHIND TWO
GREAT RUNNING BACKS,

19:04.750 --> 19:06.660
BUT NOW I GOT
SOME REPS.

19:06.660 --> 19:08.750
DARNELL:
I SAW YOUR TOUCHDOWN
AGAINST USC, THOUGH.

19:08.750 --> 19:11.130
THAT WAS
MY FIRST TD!

19:11.130 --> 19:12.630
FELT GOOD.

19:12.630 --> 19:14.090
SPENCER: FIRST OF MANY.
BRUIN: BET.

19:14.090 --> 19:15.670
COACH KELLY ALWAYS
TALKS ABOUT TRUSTING

19:15.670 --> 19:17.300
AND ENJOYING
THE PROCESS, SO,

19:17.300 --> 19:19.930
THAT'S WHAT I'M
TRYING TO DO.

19:19.930 --> 19:22.470
OK, SO,

19:22.470 --> 19:24.430
WHAT'S THE
GIRL SITUATION
LIKE HERE?

19:24.430 --> 19:25.730
SPENCER: COME ON.
DARNELL: COME ON, MAN.

19:25.730 --> 19:27.310
WHAT? I'M JUST
CURIOUS.

19:27.310 --> 19:29.730
HEY, I MEAN,
IT'S COLLEGE IN L.A.

19:29.730 --> 19:31.310
IT DON'T GET
ANY BETTER.
YOU FEEL ME?

19:31.310 --> 19:32.900
JORDAN AND DARNELL:
RESPECT.

19:32.900 --> 19:34.440
I GOTTA ROLL, BUT HEY,
YOU GOT MY NUMBER.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.900
HIT ME UP, YOU ALL GOT
ANY QUESTIONS.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.030
-SEE YOU.
-LOVE.

19:38.030 --> 19:39.910
DARNELL: THIS PLACE IS JUST...

19:39.910 --> 19:41.870
SPENCER: I KNOW. I KNOW.

19:43.160 --> 19:46.790
YO, WE SHOULD
COMMIT. TODAY.

19:46.790 --> 19:48.370
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

19:48.370 --> 19:50.210
I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING
I NEED TO SEE.

19:50.210 --> 19:51.670
YO, YOU SURE
THIS ISN'T BECAUSE

19:51.670 --> 19:53.250
THE OTHER SCHOOLS
BACKED OFF?

19:53.250 --> 19:55.340
YO, THIS IS MY DREAM
SCHOOL, MAN. WHY WAIT?

19:56.800 --> 19:58.420
I MEAN, IT WOULD
MAKE IT HARDER

19:58.420 --> 20:00.300
FOR MY MOM TO
TAKE ME AWAY IF I COMMITTED.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.600
SPENCER: RIGHT?

20:02.600 --> 20:03.850
WILSON: I WANT
TO INTRODUCE YOU GUYS

20:03.850 --> 20:05.100

20:12.440 --> 20:13.900

YOUR LIVE BEAR MASCOT
FOR HOME GAMES?

20:13.900 --> 20:15.400
ONLY IF IT CAN
BLOCK FOR DARNELL.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.320
OH, OK!

20:17.320 --> 20:18.490
WILSON: THANKS

APPRECIATE IT.

20:18.490 --> 20:20.030

20:26.410 --> 20:28.200
HE'S GONNA REMEMBER ME

20:28.200 --> 20:29.870
I'M SURE. I'M SURE.

20:29.870 --> 20:32.670
YES. OOH. WHOA!

20:34.840 --> 20:37.130
YO. CAN YOU
IMAGINE US

20:37.130 --> 20:40.260

FOR 4 YEARS?

20:40.260 --> 20:41.970
MAN.

20:41.970 --> 20:43.510
LAYLA: SO, TODAY,
YOU'LL JUST BE MEETING

20:43.510 --> 20:45.760

20:45.760 --> 20:47.010

20:47.010 --> 20:48.520
WELL, THEY JUST
KNOW HOW TO USE

20:48.520 --> 20:50.060

EQUIPMENT,

20:50.060 --> 20:51.770
BUT WE PRODUCE
THE MUSIC.

20:51.770 --> 20:53.020
COOL.

20:53.020 --> 20:55.020
UM, PETE IS
OUR SOUND ENGINEER,

20:55.020 --> 20:57.690
SO HE KNOWS WHAT ALL

20:57.690 --> 20:58.900
I GOTTA ADMIT, THIS IS

20:58.900 --> 21:00.070
WAY MORE THAN
WHAT I EXPECTED.

21:00.070 --> 21:01.740
AND IT'S
THE LIMITED PACKAGE.

21:04.870 --> 21:07.620
COOP: IS THAT...?

21:07.620 --> 21:09.950

I'M LOOKIN' FANCY... ♪

21:09.950 --> 21:12.160

SORRY, LAYLA.

21:41.610 --> 21:43.320
WILSON: WE CAN'T WAIT
TO BRING YOU BACK

21:43.320 --> 21:45.280
FOR YOUR OFFICIAL

21:45.280 --> 21:48.030

A LOT OF OTHER SCHOOLS

21:49.790 --> 21:51.160
ARE GONNA WANT YOU

21:51.160 --> 21:53.500
AND YOU EARNED THAT.
ENJOY IT.

21:53.500 --> 21:57.170
BUT IN THE END, GO

21:57.170 --> 21:59.670
WE THINK YOU'D BE

WOW. UM,

SO WHAT IF I WANTED
TO COMMIT RIGHT NOW?

22:16.730 --> 22:19.440
I DID IT, BRO.
IT'S YOUR TURN.

22:21.190 --> 22:22.490

22:28.120 --> 22:29.950
SPENCER: COACH.
WILSON: SPENCER.

22:29.950 --> 22:31.450
SO HOW'D YOUR VISIT
GO TODAY?

22:31.450 --> 22:33.450
BETTER THAN
I IMAGINED.

22:33.450 --> 22:34.790
AND I DON'T JUST MEAN
THE FACILITIES.

22:34.790 --> 22:38.290
I MEAN, IT'S A REAL
FAMILY HERE.

22:38.290 --> 22:40.340
AND I'D LIKE
TO JOIN THAT FAMILY.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.120
LARGE FRIES.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.460
MAN: THANK YOU.
WOMAN: THANK YOU.

22:56.750 --> 22:59.800
COOP: LET ME GET
A DOUBLE CAF

22:59.800 --> 23:01.210
MOCHA FRAP LATTE

23:01.210 --> 23:02.670
WITH GREEN TEA
AND ALMOND MILK.

23:02.670 --> 23:04.880
I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S A REAL DRINK.

23:04.880 --> 23:08.220
COME ON, MAN. AIN'T
THAT WHAT BEVERLY HILLS
PEOPLE ORDER?

23:08.220 --> 23:09.680
IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME, COOP.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.350
I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.980
BUT I CAN COME BACK
IF YOU'RE BUSY.

23:14.980 --> 23:18.270
NO. IT'S ALL GOOD.
MY SHIFT'S ALMOST OVER.

23:18.270 --> 23:19.860
I WAS GONNA
HIT THE GYM.

23:19.860 --> 23:21.150
COOL.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.490
WHERE YOU BEEN?

23:22.490 --> 23:23.860
YOU NOT BEEN
ANSWERING MY CALLS,

23:23.860 --> 23:25.200
AND EVERY TIME I
STOP BY YOUR SPOT,

23:25.200 --> 23:26.280
AIN'T NOBODY IN.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.660
I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

23:27.660 --> 23:29.660
NO. I DID.

23:29.660 --> 23:30.950
WHAT DID YOU DO?

23:30.950 --> 23:32.580
I GOT YOU SHOT, MAN.

23:32.580 --> 23:34.580
COME ON, MAN.
THAT'S NOT HOW
I REMEMBER IT.

23:34.580 --> 23:35.870
SPENCER, IT WAS MY FAULT.

23:35.870 --> 23:37.290
CUT THE CRAP, COOP.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.000
THIS AIN'T ON YOU.
YOU HEAR ME?

23:41.000 --> 23:42.460
IT'S NOT ON YOU.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.340
I JUST WANT
MY BEST FRIEND BACK.

23:46.340 --> 23:47.720
ME, TOO.

23:52.220 --> 23:53.720
I HEARD ABOUT
THE STUDIO.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.100
I KNOW.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.150
I'M SORRY FOR
BAILING ON HER,

23:57.150 --> 23:58.520
BUT I JUST THINK
IT'S BEST IF I TAKE

23:58.520 --> 24:00.150
SOME TIME AWAY FROM
THE MUSIC.

24:00.150 --> 24:01.360
SPENCER: WHY?
COOP: BECAUSE, MAN,

24:01.360 --> 24:02.530
THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON.

24:02.530 --> 24:04.150
WITH PREACH
BEING IN JAIL,

24:04.150 --> 24:05.610
TYRONE OUT HERE
RUNNING AROUND SOMEWHERE,

24:05.610 --> 24:06.860
AND WHEN I SEE PATIENCE--

24:06.860 --> 24:08.320
LOOK, CAN I GIVE YOU
SOME ADVICE?

24:08.320 --> 24:10.280
WHEN I QUIT
PLAYING FOOTBALL,

24:10.280 --> 24:12.450
I WAS ONE OF THE BEST
PLAYERS IN THE COUNTRY.

24:12.450 --> 24:14.200
I MEAN, I WAS GREAT.

24:14.200 --> 24:16.120
AND NOW I DON'T KNOW
IF I'LL EVER BE
THAT WAY AGAIN.

24:16.120 --> 24:17.710
NOW YOU GREAT
AT SOMETHING, COOP.

24:17.710 --> 24:20.750
DO NOT TAKE THAT
FOR GRANTED.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.880
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
YOU GET TO BE GREAT.

24:35.770 --> 24:37.640
HEY, MAN.

24:37.640 --> 24:38.690
HEY.

24:38.690 --> 24:40.400
GIMME A SPOT?

24:40.400 --> 24:41.520
YEAH. FOR SURE.

24:46.820 --> 24:49.450
HOW WAS YOUR TRIP
TO UCLA?

24:49.450 --> 24:51.240
IT'S A SPECIAL
PLACE, MAN.

24:52.910 --> 24:54.790
THAT'S A LOT OF WEIGHT.

24:54.790 --> 24:57.580
MAYBE TAKE IT EASY
TILL YOU HEAL UP, HUH?

24:57.580 --> 24:59.170
LOOK, CAN YOU PLEASE
BE THE ONE PERSON

24:59.170 --> 25:00.790
WHO DOESN'T KEEP WARNING ME
ABOUT MY INJURY?

25:00.790 --> 25:03.210
I KNOW MY BODY, ALL RIGHT?

25:03.210 --> 25:04.670
ALL RIGHT, COOL.

25:10.130 --> 25:11.890
ASHER: READY?
SPENCER: YEAH. LET'S GET IT.

25:11.890 --> 25:14.010
3, 2, 1.

25:17.980 --> 25:19.980
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF
PEOPLE SAY THERE ARE

25:19.980 --> 25:23.770
WAYS TO ACCELERATE
THE RECOVERY PROCESS.

25:23.770 --> 25:25.530
I KNOW IF I WERE
INJURED, MAN, I--

25:25.530 --> 25:27.820
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, MAN?

25:27.820 --> 25:29.610
J.J.: OH, THERE HE IS.

25:29.610 --> 25:33.990

25:35.700 --> 25:37.750
J.J.: HEY, IT'S TIME

25:37.750 --> 25:40.000
MAN, PUT THEM WEIGHTS AWAY.
WE'RE GOING OUT TONIGHT.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.040
NAH, MAN, I GOTTA DO
MY PHYSICAL THERAPY, BRO.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.540
JORDAN: NO. COME ON.

25:43.540 --> 25:44.840
YOU'RE GONNA BE
DOING PT FOR WEEKS.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.130
TAKE A NIGHT OUT

25:46.130 --> 25:47.630

25:47.630 --> 25:49.510

25:49.510 --> 25:51.090
FRATERNITY PARTY

25:51.090 --> 25:52.840
DARNELL'S COMING.
WE'RE PICKING HIM UP.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.680
YOU GUYS

25:54.680 --> 25:57.640
ASHER: HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO GET INTO A FRAT PARTY?

26:02.810 --> 26:06.980
SECRET HANDSHAKE, YO.
I'M A LEGACY.

26:06.980 --> 26:09.030
MAN: WELCOME TO PSI BETA TAU!

26:09.030 --> 26:10.820
DRINKS ARE EVERYWHERE.

26:10.820 --> 26:13.200
HEY. HOW UGLY IS
THAT DUDE'S SHIRT?

26:13.200 --> 26:14.660
J.J.: AH, IT'S
NOT THAT BAD.

26:14.660 --> 26:17.240
IT ALMOST GAVE ME
A SEIZURE.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.450
WAIT. ARE YOU
DARNELL HAYES?

26:18.450 --> 26:19.790
UH, YEAH, AND--

26:19.790 --> 26:21.290

26:23.620 --> 26:27.170
DARNELL HAYES.
LET'S GET HIM TO COMMIT
TO COASTAL CALIFORNIA!

26:27.170 --> 26:28.960
DARNELL: ACTUALLY, I ALREADY--
MAN: MAKE IT HAPPEN.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.010
SHOW HIM SOME LOVE.

26:40.470 --> 26:44.650
YO, UM, YOU SHOULD
GET IN ON THAT LOVE.

26:44.650 --> 26:46.770
SPENCER: NAH. THIS IS
DARNELL'S MOMENT.

26:46.770 --> 26:49.530
HE'S HAD A ROUGH TIME.
HE DESERVES THIS.

26:49.530 --> 26:51.400
I JUST HOPE YOU KNOW
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.360
I MEAN, THAT UCLA
CAMPUS WAS INSANE.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.240
COME ON, MAN.
YOU COULD STILL
GET A OFFER THERE.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.200
MAYBE WITH A BIG
SENIOR SEASON.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.580
I MEAN, I AM
THE LIVE BEAR GUY.

26:58.580 --> 26:59.870
OH, MY GOD.

26:59.870 --> 27:01.620
BUT, I MEAN,

27:01.620 --> 27:03.210
THEY'VE ALREADY GOT
THEIR QB, SO...

27:04.670 --> 27:05.710
YEAH.

27:21.520 --> 27:23.310
J.J.: OH, LOOK WHO'S

27:26.650 --> 27:27.730
TROY: THANKS, BRO.

27:29.520 --> 27:30.900
HEY, SPENCE,

27:30.900 --> 27:32.110
THIS IS
YOUR NIGHT, TOO.

27:32.110 --> 27:34.950
WE'RE ALL REALLY
PROUD OF YOU.

27:34.950 --> 27:36.820
TO A FULL RIDE.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.160
FULL RIDE.

27:41.450 --> 27:44.460
J.J.: AHH.
ASHER: HUH! WHOO!

27:49.340 --> 27:51.920
DUDE, I CAN
STAY HERE ALL DAY.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.670
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GET COMFORTABLE.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.220
I CAN TAKE MOST OF
THESE GUYS, RIGHT?

28:00.220 --> 28:01.600
WHAT, LIKE,
IN A FIGHT?

28:01.600 --> 28:03.930
NO, NO, LIKE...

28:03.930 --> 28:05.350
LIKE ARM WRESTLING
OR SOMETHING.

28:05.350 --> 28:06.690
PLEASE DON'T
ARM-WRESTLE NOBODY.

28:06.690 --> 28:08.060
I'M JUST POINTING OUT
I'M BIG ENOUGH

28:08.060 --> 28:10.480
TO COMPETE WITH
THE COLLEGE GUYS.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.730
YOU KNOW, THE EYE TEST.

28:13.690 --> 28:16.200
HOW MANY OF THOSE
HAVE YOU HAD?

28:16.200 --> 28:17.610
I'M FINE, MAN.

28:17.610 --> 28:20.070
WHAT WERE YOU
SAYING BEFORE?

28:20.070 --> 28:21.330
YOU KNOW, ABOUT
IF YOU WERE INJURED,

28:21.330 --> 28:22.700
THE STUFF
YOU COULD TAKE

28:22.700 --> 28:23.830
TO ACCELERATE
THE HEALING PROCESS?

28:23.830 --> 28:25.160
NOTHING.
FORGET I SAID IT.

28:25.160 --> 28:27.160
NO. WERE YOU TALKING
ABOUT STEROIDS?

28:27.160 --> 28:28.790
IS THAT WHY YOU'VE
BEEN SO GOOD ON
THE FIELD LATELY?

28:28.790 --> 28:30.420
RIGHT, 'CAUSE IT
WOULD TAKE STEROIDS

28:30.420 --> 28:31.880
FOR SOMEONE ELSE
TO BE AS GOOD AS
SPENCER JAMES?

28:31.880 --> 28:33.670
I DIDN'T SAY ALL THAT.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.420
I JUST KNOW HOW
DANGEROUS THAT STUFF
CAN BE, ALL RIGHT?

28:35.420 --> 28:36.920
WHATEVER, MAN. LOOK,
I'M NOT USING ANYTHING,

28:36.920 --> 28:38.840
SO WORRY
ABOUT YOURSELF.

28:54.190 --> 28:57.690
IS THAT A NEW SONG?

28:57.690 --> 29:00.530
NAH, I'M JUST
WRITING DOWN SOME THOUGHTS.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.490
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?

29:03.830 --> 29:05.740
SORRY. SORRY.

29:05.740 --> 29:07.830
IT'S NONE OF
MY BUSINESS.

29:07.830 --> 29:10.210
UM, I WAS SURPRISED

29:10.210 --> 29:11.880
TO SEE YOU
AT THE STUDIO.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.500
YEAH. SOUNDED
REAL GOOD.

29:14.500 --> 29:17.590
THANK YOU. UM...

29:17.590 --> 29:20.050
ARE YOU WORKING
WITH LAYLA?

29:20.050 --> 29:22.300
MM. WE WAS GONNA
DO A SONG TOGETHER,

29:22.300 --> 29:25.100
BUT IT JUST DIDN'T--

29:25.100 --> 29:27.140
SOMETHING DIDN'T
FEEL RIGHT.

29:29.850 --> 29:32.980
I WANT US TO BE
FRIENDS, COOP.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.110
MAYBE WE'LL
GET THERE SOMEDAY.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.400
OK.

29:42.700 --> 29:45.620
AND WHAT IS IT LIKE?

29:45.620 --> 29:48.080
WORKING WITH J.P.?

29:48.080 --> 29:50.160
I DON'T KNOW. I'M STILL
GETTING USED TO IT.

29:50.160 --> 29:53.370
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
AS FUN AS WHEN WE
WORKED TOGETHER.

29:53.370 --> 29:57.000
YOU KNOW,
IT JUST FEELS
SO BUSINESSLIKE.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.840
WELL, IT IS
A BIG BUSINESS.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.840
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST
KEEP THINKING THAT
I'M GONNA MESS UP

30:00.840 --> 30:03.050
AND THEY'RE
GONNA REALIZE

30:03.050 --> 30:04.550
I'M NOT AS GOOD
AS THEY THOUGHT I WAS

30:04.550 --> 30:06.050
AND I DON'T KNOW.

30:06.050 --> 30:08.140
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.560
YOU'RE EVEN BETTER THAN
WHATEVER THEY THINK YOU ARE.

30:10.560 --> 30:13.020
JUST GOTTA
DO YOU, PATIENCE,

30:13.020 --> 30:15.730
AND GO GET IT.

30:15.730 --> 30:18.150
OK. I'LL, UM,

30:18.150 --> 30:19.730
I'LL SEE YOU
AROUND, COOP.

30:28.790 --> 30:32.580
UHH! YES!

30:32.580 --> 30:35.080
TOO EASY!
WHO'S NEXT?

30:35.080 --> 30:37.960
DUDE, YOU NEED
TO CHILL.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.590
CHILL?

30:39.590 --> 30:41.010
I'LL TAKE ON
THIS WHOLE PARTY,

30:41.010 --> 30:42.630
INCLUDING YOU
AND YOUR UGLY SHIRT.

30:42.630 --> 30:44.130
TROY: OK, THAT'S IT.
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO COME

30:44.130 --> 30:45.640
ESCORT THIS PUNK
OUT OF HERE.

30:45.640 --> 30:47.390
HEY, THIS PUNK IS ABOUT
TO LAY YOU OUT, MAN.

30:47.390 --> 30:49.140
COME ON. ASHER,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

30:49.140 --> 30:50.560
IT'S TIME FOR
ALL YOU KIDS
TO GO TO BED.

30:50.560 --> 30:51.770
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU JUST SAY?

30:51.770 --> 30:53.020
SOUNDED
DISRESPECTFUL TO ME.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.850
IT WAS MEANT
TO BE DISRESPECTFUL.

30:55.850 --> 30:57.940
OH, LOOK, THESE GUYS
GOT UGLY SHIRTS, TOO.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.480
OH, THIS IS
AN UGLY SHIRT PARTY.

31:01.480 --> 31:04.030
I THINK IT'S JUST
UGLY SHIRTS.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.410
WHAT'S IT GONNA
BE, LEGACY?

31:05.410 --> 31:08.700
AH--I DIDN'T WANT
TO WEIGH IN ON THIS,

31:08.700 --> 31:10.540
BUT I WILL.

31:10.540 --> 31:12.200
I WOULDN'T WEAR
ANY OF THOSE
SHIRTS, EITHER.

31:12.200 --> 31:14.210
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE SHIRTS.

31:14.210 --> 31:16.250
I MEAN, WHOSE SIDE
ARE YOU ON?

31:16.250 --> 31:19.750
OH. EXCUSE ME.

31:19.750 --> 31:22.670
J.J.: WITH MY BOYS, OBVIOUSLY.
TROY: OK.

31:22.670 --> 31:24.420
THEN YOU NEED
TO TAKE YOUR BOYS
OUT OF HERE,

31:24.420 --> 31:26.470
AND DON'T EVER
COME BACK.

31:26.470 --> 31:28.340
FINE BY ME.
I'M A LEGACY

31:28.340 --> 31:31.260
AT, LIKE,
4 FRATERNITIES.

31:31.260 --> 31:33.520
LET'S ROLL.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.270
UGLY SHIRTS.

31:41.270 --> 31:42.980
GRACE: RENEE,
IF YOU WANT, I CAN JUST

31:42.980 --> 31:44.650
CALL YOU
WHEN THEY GET HOME.

31:44.650 --> 31:46.110
I AIN'T GOING NOWHERE.

31:46.110 --> 31:48.820
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT TIME IT IS?

31:48.820 --> 31:50.330
IT'S LATE.

31:50.330 --> 31:51.830
IT IS LATER THAN DARNELL
HAS EVER STAYED OUT

31:51.830 --> 31:53.290
WHEN HE WAS
LIVING WITH ME.

31:53.290 --> 31:55.750
IS THIS WHAT
HE DOES HERE?

31:55.750 --> 31:58.210
YOU ALMOST HAD ME, GRACE.

31:58.210 --> 31:59.880
MM-HMM, WITH THAT WHOLE

31:59.880 --> 32:02.630
"DARNELL DESERVES A VOTE
IN HIS FUTURE" THING.

32:02.630 --> 32:03.920
BUT HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO LEAVE MY SON

32:03.920 --> 32:05.470
IN THIS HOUSE
AFTER TONIGHT?

32:05.470 --> 32:07.180
RENEE, THIS HAS
NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

32:07.180 --> 32:08.590
I DON'T KNOW YOU,

32:08.590 --> 32:09.970
AND I'M NOT
SEEING ANYTHING

32:09.970 --> 32:11.550
THAT SHOWS ME
DARNELL LIVING HERE

32:11.550 --> 32:13.930
IS WHAT'S BEST
FOR HIM.

32:13.930 --> 32:15.730
HE'S COMING HOME
TO GERMANY.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.990
JORDAN AND J.J. WENT
TO ANOTHER FRAT PARTY

32:27.990 --> 32:29.490
AND ORDERED ME
A RIDE HOME,

32:29.490 --> 32:32.830
BUT FOR SOME REASON,
I ENDED UP HERE.

32:34.950 --> 32:36.910
YEAH, THAT WAS
MY IDEA.

32:36.910 --> 32:38.160
I WAS HOPING
TO CHALLENGE

32:38.160 --> 32:39.870
THE ARM WRESTLING CHAMP.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.380
HE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THAT?

32:43.460 --> 32:47.220
I MUST'VE LOOKED LIKE
A TOTAL IDIOT TONIGHT.

32:47.220 --> 32:48.880
DIDN'T SOUND GREAT.

32:50.220 --> 32:51.840
THANKS.

32:51.840 --> 32:54.060
HEY.

32:54.060 --> 32:57.390
WE'RE ALWAYS HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

32:57.390 --> 32:58.770
RIGHT.

32:58.770 --> 33:00.480
SO WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU?

33:04.520 --> 33:08.280
I'VE JUST BEEN FEELING
A LOT OF PRESSURE LATELY,

33:08.280 --> 33:10.570
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN
HANDLING IT WELL.

33:10.570 --> 33:13.070
IT'S MADE ME DO
SOME THINGS THAT

33:13.070 --> 33:15.410
I SHOULDN'T BE
DOING, LIKE...

33:15.410 --> 33:19.160
LIKE GETTING DRUNK
AND ARM-WRESTLING
FRAT GUYS?

33:20.330 --> 33:22.670
YEAH. EXACTLY.
AND, YOU KNOW,

33:22.670 --> 33:24.670
WITH YOU IN RECOVERY,
I SHOULDN'T--

33:24.670 --> 33:27.170
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO BE
STUPID ONCE IN A WHILE.

33:27.170 --> 33:28.760
HEY, JUST BE CAREFUL.

33:28.760 --> 33:30.720
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

33:35.810 --> 33:37.560
SO THIS IS WHERE
IT ALL HAPPENED?

33:37.560 --> 33:41.640
YEAH. I WAS WALKING
RIGHT THERE WITH LIV.

33:41.640 --> 33:45.610
TWO BULLETS.
ONE MISSED.

33:45.610 --> 33:48.480
IF I WAS STANDING
RIGHT THERE,

33:48.480 --> 33:50.360
I'D HAVE NO FUTURE.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.990
DAMN. THAT BULLET

33:55.990 --> 33:58.580
MISSED FOR
A REASON, MAN.

33:58.580 --> 34:00.290
YOUR FUTURE'S
JUST TOO BRIGHT.

34:00.290 --> 34:01.870
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT'S GONNA BE, THOUGH.

34:01.870 --> 34:03.460
I DO. YOU'RE
GONNA BE CATCHING

34:03.460 --> 34:06.670
PASSES FROM ME
AT UCLA, BOY.

34:06.670 --> 34:09.050
COACH DIDN'T ACCEPT
MY COMMITMENT, MAN.

34:09.050 --> 34:10.630
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

34:10.630 --> 34:13.090
I TRIED TO COMMIT.

34:13.090 --> 34:15.600
HE SAID MY OFFER'S
ON HOLD RIGHT NOW

34:15.600 --> 34:17.220
JUST LIKE ALL
THE OTHER COLLEGES.

34:19.350 --> 34:21.770
THEY'RE GONNA WAIT
AND SEE HOW MY
INJURY HEALS UP.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.020
DAMAGED GOODS.

34:26.020 --> 34:30.030
LOOK, YO, IF YOU'RE
NOT GONNA COMMIT,
THEN I'M NOT--

34:30.030 --> 34:32.490
NO. LOOK,
THE COACH IS--

34:32.490 --> 34:33.610
HE WAS COOL
ABOUT IT, MAN.

34:33.610 --> 34:35.320
HE'S A REAL
STAND-UP GUY.

34:35.320 --> 34:36.910
AND I GET IT.

34:36.910 --> 34:38.410
THEY ONLY GOT
25 SPOTS EACH YEAR.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.330
THEY CAN'T WASTE ONE
ON ME IF I CAN'T PLAY.

34:43.960 --> 34:45.880
YO, IT'S GONNA WORK OUT,

34:45.880 --> 34:47.670
'CAUSE IT'S
ALL ABOUT HEART,

34:47.670 --> 34:49.800
AND A BULLET AIN'T
TAKE THAT FROM YOU.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.480
RENEE: IT IS
ABOUT DAMN TIME.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.020
SO WHO'S GONNA GO FIRST?

35:07.020 --> 35:10.110
I KNOW THAT LOOK.
THIS AIN'T GONNA BE GOOD.

35:10.110 --> 35:11.690
OH, NOBODY'S
TALKING, HUH?

35:11.690 --> 35:13.280
OK, I GUESS
I'LL GO FIRST.

35:13.280 --> 35:14.740
GRACE: NO, I'LL GO FIRST.
RENEE: I GOT THIS.

35:14.740 --> 35:16.530
NO, I GOT THIS.
THIS IS MY HOUSE.

35:16.530 --> 35:19.950
BOTH OF YOU
SIT. NOW.

35:19.950 --> 35:21.660
COME ON. LET'S GO.

35:21.660 --> 35:23.500
WHY YOU AIN'T MOVING?
COME ON.

35:23.500 --> 35:26.460
MOVE IT. SIT DOWN!

35:26.460 --> 35:28.290
NOW, WHAT IN THE HELL
MAKES YOU THINK

35:28.290 --> 35:29.920
YOU CAN WALK INTO
MY HOUSE AT THIS HOUR?

35:29.920 --> 35:31.000
SPENCER: MOM--
GRACE: DON'T YOU EVEN THINK

35:31.000 --> 35:32.250
ABOUT OPENING YOUR MOUTH.

35:32.250 --> 35:33.670
JUST BECAUSE
I ASK YOU A QUESTION

35:33.670 --> 35:35.510
DOESN'T MEAN I WANT
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

35:35.510 --> 35:38.010
DARNELL: YO...
SPENCER: NOPE. MM-MM.

35:38.010 --> 35:40.510
GRACE: THERE IS NOTHING
THAT EITHER OF YOU COULD SAY

35:40.510 --> 35:42.010
THAT WOULD JUSTIFY
THE DISRESPECT

35:42.010 --> 35:46.140
YOU'VE SHOWN ME,
RENEE, OR MY HOUSE.

35:46.140 --> 35:48.020
YOU HAVE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO ADD?

35:48.020 --> 35:49.980
NO. IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU GOT THIS.

35:49.980 --> 35:51.690
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WANT TO HEAR
THE EXCUSE ANYWAY.

35:51.690 --> 35:52.730
DON'T YOU
WANT TO KNOW, RENEE?

35:52.730 --> 35:53.860
OH, I WANT
TO HEAR IT.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.440
GRACE: SO, TELL US.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.150
LOOK AT ME.

35:57.150 --> 36:00.530
WHY WOULD YOU WALK IN HERE
WAY PAST YOUR CURFEW

36:00.530 --> 36:04.580
WITHOUT SO MUCH AS
A PHONE CALL OR A TEXT?

36:04.580 --> 36:07.000
SPEAK.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.250
OH, I--I DIDN'T KNOW

36:08.250 --> 36:09.670
IF I WAS ALLOWED
TO SPEAK.

36:09.670 --> 36:11.710
RENEE: BOY...

36:11.710 --> 36:13.960
-MM-MM.
-UH, WE WERE CELEBRATING.

36:16.260 --> 36:18.720
I COMMITTED TO UCLA TODAY.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.300
IT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
MOMENTS OF MY LIFE, MOM.

36:23.680 --> 36:25.310
DID YOU COMMIT, TOO?

36:27.060 --> 36:31.560
I TRIED. THEY AIN'T GOT
A SPOT FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

36:31.560 --> 36:34.020
OH, BABY.

36:34.020 --> 36:36.480
IT'S OK.

36:36.480 --> 36:39.280
SPENCER,
YOU ARE GOING TO

36:39.280 --> 36:41.360
GET THROUGH
THIS INJURY,

36:41.360 --> 36:42.620
AND WE'RE GONNA
BE THERE FOR YOU

36:42.620 --> 36:44.330
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

36:44.330 --> 36:46.240
ME, TOO.

36:46.240 --> 36:47.870
IT WON'T FEEL
THE SAME WITHOUT
MY BROTHER THERE.

36:47.870 --> 36:50.040
COME ON, MAN.
YOU AIN'T GOTTA
WORRY ABOUT ME.

36:50.040 --> 36:51.920
AIN'T NOTHING
GONNA STOP ME

36:51.920 --> 36:53.790
GETTING BACK TO THE PLAYER
I WAS, ALL RIGHT?

36:53.790 --> 36:56.300
NOTHING. IT'S MY FUTURE.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.350
WHY DON'T WE TALK
ABOUT THIS TOMORROW?

37:08.310 --> 37:09.770
THANK YOU, GRACE.

37:17.730 --> 37:20.150
GRACE: YOU BEEN DRINKING?
SPENCER: MM-MM.

37:20.150 --> 37:24.660
SLAP DOWN HERE
A LITTLE MORE BASS.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.830
HERE AND, UM--

37:28.830 --> 37:30.410
COOP.

37:30.410 --> 37:32.670
I'M SORRY FOR BAILING
ON YOU YESTERDAY.

37:32.670 --> 37:34.670
DOES THIS MEAN
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND?

37:34.670 --> 37:36.960
THIS JUST
AIN'T WHO I AM.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.260
I DON'T NEED
ALL THIS FANCY STUFF,

37:39.260 --> 37:41.510
ALL THIS
EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT.

37:41.510 --> 37:43.220
IS THAT PETE?

37:43.220 --> 37:44.760
LAYLA: YEAH.
COOP: NO OFFENSE,

37:44.760 --> 37:47.260
BUT I DON'T NEED PETE.

37:47.260 --> 37:48.350
OK. SORRY, PETE.

37:56.860 --> 37:59.480
THIS IS WHO I AM.

37:59.480 --> 38:02.200
THIS IS ALL I NEED,
ALL WE NEED.

38:02.200 --> 38:04.070
I WANNA WORK
WITH YOU,

38:04.070 --> 38:05.700
AND I THINK
WE CAN MAKE GREAT
STUFF TOGETHER.

YEAH. SHE'S TOUGH.

38:50.410 --> 38:51.790
I LIKE HER.

38:51.790 --> 38:53.200
ME, TOO.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.830
WHEN YOU WERE
GROWING UP,

38:55.830 --> 38:57.420
I WASN'T ALWAYS
THE BEST MOM.

38:57.420 --> 39:00.090
I WAS GONE A LOT.

39:00.090 --> 39:03.050
NOW I WANT A DO-OVER
WITH YOU,

39:03.050 --> 39:05.840
BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE
OF YOUR FUTURE

39:05.840 --> 39:07.430
AND YOUR HAPPINESS.

39:08.890 --> 39:10.890
SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT I--

39:10.890 --> 39:13.770
YOU CAN STAY
IN CRENSHAW.

39:13.770 --> 39:15.850
I AM PROUD OF YOU.

39:15.850 --> 39:17.690
YOU EARNED THIS
WITH YOUR HARD WORK

39:17.690 --> 39:20.360
AND YOUR TALENT.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.570
JUST DON'T
BREAK CURFEW AGAIN.

39:22.570 --> 39:23.940
GRACE JAMES WILL
LIGHT YOUR ASS UP

39:23.940 --> 39:25.820
AND I WON'T BE HERE
TO PROTECT YOU.

39:27.490 --> 39:28.990
THANKS, MOM.

39:28.990 --> 39:30.990
I LOVE YOU.

39:30.990 --> 39:32.740
I LOVE YOU, TOO, MOM.

HI.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.380
I WANTED TO SAY
GOOD-BYE BEFORE LEAVING.

40:23.750 --> 40:26.210
I GAVE DARNELL
MY BLESSING

40:26.210 --> 40:29.260
TO STAY IN CRENSHAW
WITH YOU.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.010
I MISJUDGED YOU, GRACE.

40:31.010 --> 40:33.510
MY SON IS CLEARLY
IN WONDERFUL HANDS

40:33.510 --> 40:34.810

40:34.810 --> 40:36.770
THANK YOU.
WE LOVE DARNELL.

40:36.770 --> 40:40.060
I CAN TELL.

40:40.060 --> 40:42.360
GRACE: DO YOU WANT TO COME IN?
RENEE: NO, NO.

40:42.360 --> 40:45.230
BEFORE I GO,
A FEW YEARS AGO,

40:45.230 --> 40:48.360
THERE WAS A SERVICEMAN
IN THE ARMY, FRIEND OF MINE.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.740
HE WAS WOUNDED
DURING COMBAT.

40:50.740 --> 40:52.450
SPINAL INJURY.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.950
THEY TOLD HIM
TO TAKE HIS TIME
BEFORE COMING BACK,

40:54.950 --> 40:57.290
BUT HE RUSHED BACK
WAY TOO SOON

40:57.290 --> 40:59.620
AND REINJURED HIMSELF.

40:59.620 --> 41:01.620
I REMEMBER HE HAD
THIS LOOK IN HIS EYES,

41:01.620 --> 41:03.960
LIKE HE WOULDN'T
TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.460
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

41:05.460 --> 41:08.010
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT,

41:08.010 --> 41:11.340
I SAW THAT SAME LOOK
IN SPENCER'S EYES.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.180
HEY, SPENCER.

41:15.180 --> 41:16.760
HEY!

41:16.760 --> 41:18.310
COME ON, MAN.

41:18.310 --> 41:20.730
THE DOCTOR SAID
LOW-IMPACT WORKOUTS.

41:20.730 --> 41:22.020
I DON'T CARE WHAT
THE DOCTOR SAID, ALL RIGHT?

41:22.020 --> 41:23.400
WELL, I DO.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.860
I'MA PROVE THEM
ALL WRONG, COACH.

41:25.860 --> 41:27.280
I'MA BE BETTER
THAN I EVER WAS.

41:27.280 --> 41:29.190
BELIEVE THAT.
IN FACT, YOU CAN

41:29.190 --> 41:30.820
PENCIL ME IN
THE STARTING LINEUP

41:30.820 --> 41:33.030
FOR THAT JAMBOREE GAME
WE GOT COMING UP, ALL RIGHT?

41:33.030 --> 41:34.780
LOOK, SPENCER, YOU KNOW
I CAN'T JUST--

41:34.780 --> 41:36.700
LOOK. NO DISRESPECT,

41:36.700 --> 41:38.410
BUT THIS AIN'T UP
FOR DISCUSSION.

41:38.410 --> 41:40.370
MY BODY, MY CHOICE.

41:42.580 --> 41:44.130
I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

41:44.130 --> 41:46.250
I'LL BE BACK REAL SOON.
