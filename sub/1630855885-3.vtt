00:14.753 --> 00:16.929
Please, I can't do this

00:16.973 --> 00:18.975
What is the word
on the street these days

00:19.019 --> 00:20.933
about herringbone?

-Not now, Dad.
-FRASIER: It's all right,

I've got some options

I can't do this alone.

00:28.376 --> 00:31.074
So tell me, are you in
or are you out?

Because if I
walk out that door...

Now, I know
what you two are thinking:

01:04.760 --> 01:08.068
"here comes the Harvard lecturer
in his hackneyed tweed."

01:09.417 --> 01:12.333
No, but I was thinking,
"How long is it gonna

01:12.376 --> 01:14.422
take my dad to mention
he's teaching at Harvard?"

01:14.465 --> 01:16.511
Under a minute. It's impressive.

01:17.555 --> 01:19.818
So, just a bit longer than
you actually attended Harvard?

01:21.646 --> 01:23.822
So, mock me if you will,
but this is the beginning

01:23.866 --> 01:25.476
of a new academic era for me.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.783
Frasier Crane is stepping
into a world where he can

-but Eve's got
a big audition this week.
-Mm-hmm.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.751
It's a play about a girl
who works at a slaughterhouse

01:39.795 --> 01:41.884
and she convinces her coworkers
to unionize

01:41.926 --> 01:45.192

Dad, could you just...

01:52.372 --> 01:53.983
could you give us
a little peace and quiet?

01:54.026 --> 01:55.680
Oh, I'm sorry, yes,
if only Eve had a place

01:55.723 --> 01:57.291
where she could be on her own.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.293
Perhaps someplace that
I've already paid for,

might be cheating on me.

call-in question.

She's my mom.

if you're as handsome in person

05:15.967 --> 05:17.317
No, it's not okay.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.579
Why does he need to know
your net worth?

05:18.622 --> 05:20.276
A man's true value
has always be...

05:20.320 --> 05:22.365
Oh, my God, uncle,
you're like a Rockefeller.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.236

05:24.280 --> 05:27.239
Kind of makes your Christmas
gifts seem ungenerous.

All right, all right.
That's enough, that's enough!

05:30.721 --> 05:33.376
I'd like to make one thing
absolutely clear.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.987
This class will have
nothing to do with my career,

05:36.031 --> 05:38.120
my public life
or my old TV show.

05:38.163 --> 05:41.515
I am here to lead you on
a challenging academic odyssey.

05:41.558 --> 05:44.692
And if you are here
for any other reason...

05:45.780 --> 05:47.782
...then I invite you
to leave now.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.189
Great.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.585
Well, we've

06:08.629 --> 06:10.544
separated the
wheat from the chaff.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.328
Now...

06:13.460 --> 06:15.331
...are there any
serious questions?

06:18.203 --> 06:19.640
I'm six foot, one.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.383
Tried to finish the lecture.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.167
As I continued to talk,
their eyes

06:25.210 --> 06:27.517
just started to glaze over
as if they weren't even...

06:32.261 --> 06:33.480
Alan.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.439
-Alan!
-Mm?

06:36.483 --> 06:38.267
Yeah, I'm glad
it went so smoothly.

06:38.310 --> 06:41.009
-Another triumph.
-No. No.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.576
I failed.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.707
I wanted them to take me
seriously as a professor,

06:44.752 --> 06:47.450
and they rejected me,
completely.

06:47.494 --> 06:51.280
If you would just stop trying,
I promise you will stop failing.

06:52.847 --> 06:56.590
Dr. Crane, I just left
the registrar's office.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.592
Eight students withdrew
from your class today.

06:58.635 --> 07:00.158
Olivia, please.

07:00.202 --> 07:01.943
Frasier's taking this
hard enough as it is.

07:01.986 --> 07:03.597
Most of them then signed up
for your class.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.425
Damn it, Frasier,
get your act together!

07:06.861 --> 07:08.253
OLIVIA:
What happened?

07:08.297 --> 07:09.864
I thought you'd be
natural at teaching.

07:09.907 --> 07:12.170
You have decades of experience
in TV and radio.

07:12.214 --> 07:14.042
But that's not teaching.
That's entertainment.

07:14.085 --> 07:15.522
I'm not a dancing bear.

07:15.565 --> 07:18.089
Oh, no one thinks of you
as a dancing bear.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.483
But universities have changed
since you were a student here

07:20.527 --> 07:23.138
for... thir... twe... for...
several decades ago.

07:24.748 --> 07:27.621
Students today
need a little showmanship.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.057
That's where you come in.

07:29.100 --> 07:32.234
You make the hard ideas
go down easy.

07:32.277 --> 07:33.801
[chuckles]

07:33.844 --> 07:36.368
So, I'm the cheese
wrapped around a dog's pill?

07:37.369 --> 07:38.632
Yes, you get it.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.460
Now, if you could just see

07:40.503 --> 07:43.985
how enthusiastically
the students would react

07:44.028 --> 07:46.291
to just a little glimpse
of the old you,

07:46.335 --> 07:47.902
I know you would
change your mind.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.120
I'm not changing my mind.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.341
Okay, but we still
need you to succeed.

07:52.384 --> 07:54.038
We are paying you
a lot of money.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.431
You're paying me almost nothing.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.477
Which is a lot of money
in academia.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.523
It is all about the numbers.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.090
And if you do not bring more
students into this department,

08:02.133 --> 08:03.526
well, then the numbers
are not good.

08:03.570 --> 08:04.962
What do you suggest?

08:06.007 --> 08:08.270
Uh, well,
this is a new career for you,

08:08.313 --> 08:10.490
so maybe you would benefit
from some seasoned help.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.667
-That sounds reasonable.
-That's perceptive.
-Mm-hmm.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.538
So, until you get your sea legs,

08:15.582 --> 08:17.192
why don't you co-teach
your classes with Alan?

08:17.235 --> 08:18.846
-Well, that's ridiculous.
-What is wrong with you?

08:18.889 --> 08:20.804
My goodness.

08:20.848 --> 08:23.111
Alan is-is lazy.

08:23.154 --> 08:24.982
He doesn't even finish
anything he starts.

08:25.026 --> 08:26.854
And Frasier is...

08:26.897 --> 08:28.159
Eh.

08:33.861 --> 08:36.167
What do you say, Alan--
is it worth a try?

08:36.211 --> 08:37.821
Well...

08:37.865 --> 08:40.302
Please, Alan,
help me help Dr. Crane help

08:40.345 --> 08:43.000
the next generation of people
who will help other people.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.656
Sounds like a Ponzi scheme
of benevolence.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.180
Are you really saying

08:49.224 --> 08:51.792
I should take on extra work
without extra pay?

08:51.835 --> 08:54.490
I am saying that you should help
your oldest and dearest friend.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.145
Without extra pay.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.757
You can bring your cat
back to the office.

09:01.758 --> 09:03.891
Fine, I'll do it.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.545
Anything for a dear friend.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.808
You're talking about your cat?

09:07.851 --> 09:10.114
Well, who do you think
I was talking about?

09:15.642 --> 09:17.295
You in a hurry to get home
to get your cat?

09:17.339 --> 09:19.559
No, no, that would be silly.

09:19.602 --> 09:20.734
Frasier Crane,

09:20.777 --> 09:22.649
meet Margaret Scratcher.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.785
Now, if I may,

09:28.829 --> 09:31.614
what's so offensive
about being a dancing bear?

09:31.658 --> 09:35.183
You're a natural showman.
Why not use that talent?

09:35.226 --> 09:36.401
I don't want to be
a showman anymore.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.273
I want to make an impact.

09:38.316 --> 09:40.188
Well, didn't you make an impact
on your television program?

09:40.231 --> 09:41.755
Well, it's debatable.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.670
But then again, you know that.
You saw it.

09:46.847 --> 09:48.239
You did see my show, didn't you?

09:48.283 --> 09:49.632
Of course.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.547
B... Bits and pieces.

09:52.722 --> 09:54.376
I may have missed it.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.465
It was on for 14 years.

09:56.508 --> 09:59.642
Here, let me show you.

20:44.199 --> 20:46.288
[chanting]:
Fight, fight, fight, fight,

20:46.332 --> 20:47.855
-fight, fight, fight,
-All right, all right.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.291
-fight, fight, fight...
-Everyone, calm down.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.162
She's only here
because my uncle pays

20:51.206 --> 20:53.034
for an apartment
for her and her baby.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.906
All right, stop, stop!

20:57.778 --> 20:58.822
Everyone.

20:59.997 --> 21:02.130
I think it's time...

21:02.173 --> 21:05.307
we put on our

21:05.351 --> 21:07.266
-thinking caps.
-Thinking caps!

21:20.366 --> 21:22.542
Sounds like
your class went well.

21:22.585 --> 21:25.762
I was teaching next door
and the applause woke me up.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.766
Yes.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.942
I had them eating
out of the palm of my hand.

21:33.248 --> 21:35.511
Did manage to squeeze in

21:35.555 --> 21:37.557
20 minutes about
Hermann Ebbinghaus

21:37.600 --> 21:40.211
because of this silly hat,

21:40.255 --> 21:41.691
and a story I told them about

21:41.735 --> 21:44.607
Albert Swinestein's
quiz show scandal.

21:44.651 --> 21:46.653
So, why do you look so glum?

21:46.696 --> 21:49.830
Because this wasn't
who I wanted to be.

21:49.873 --> 21:51.919
Thirty years ago...

21:51.962 --> 21:54.617
I left Boston
with my tail between my legs.

21:55.879 --> 21:59.187
I had dreams
of returning, triumphant.

21:59.230 --> 22:01.015
Now those dreams
just keep slipping

22:01.058 --> 22:02.495
farther and farther away.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.454
It's a rather fetching hat.

22:05.498 --> 22:07.195
May I have a look?

22:08.849 --> 22:10.416
Ow!

22:10.459 --> 22:11.634
What was that for?

22:11.678 --> 22:13.941
For being a baby.

22:13.984 --> 22:17.031
You're rich, you're famous,
your students love you.

22:17.074 --> 22:20.034
For some reason, you smell
naturally of sandalwood.

22:21.078 --> 22:22.558
What more
could you possibly want?

22:22.602 --> 22:24.255
I wanted to make an impact.

22:24.299 --> 22:26.432
Wanted to realize
the potential I had

22:26.475 --> 22:28.521
when I set out on this
career path 40 years ago.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.437
I see.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.744
That's a rather fetching belt.
Do you mind if I have a look?

22:36.180 --> 22:37.921
Am I being that ridiculous?

22:37.965 --> 22:40.228
You got 18-year-olds
to listen to a lecture

22:40.271 --> 22:42.839
about Ebbinghaus for 20 minutes,

22:42.883 --> 22:45.668
and all it took was a silly hat
and a story about a pig.

22:45.712 --> 22:47.583
Which, by the way,
I have to hear.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.587
[gasps]
♪ Dr. Crane.♪

22:51.631 --> 22:53.546
Oh, it was marvelous!

22:53.589 --> 22:55.678
The students were raving.
You're a hit.

22:55.722 --> 22:59.682
Yes, Frasier was just
complaining about being beloved.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.555
Do you mind if
I take a look at this hat?

23:04.557 --> 23:05.949
Hmm.

23:05.993 --> 23:08.474
I have a little bit
of a confession.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.389
This thinking cap
wasn't shipped overnight.

23:10.432 --> 23:13.392
I bought it years ago when
I came to see your show live.

23:13.435 --> 23:16.264
You were a fan of the show?

23:16.307 --> 23:18.440
-Mm-hmm.
-You-you didn't mention that.

23:18.484 --> 23:21.051
It's a little bit
embarrassing, but

23:21.095 --> 23:24.533
I even ran my local chapter
of the Frasier Crane Fan Club.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.275
You were a Craniac?

23:31.671 --> 23:35.196
Watching you lift up
and educate your viewers--

23:35.239 --> 23:37.633
that's why I decided
to get my PhD.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.767
So, my show
actually inspired you,

23:40.810 --> 23:42.246
despite all
the meaningless fluff?

23:42.290 --> 23:45.119
[chuckles] Because
of the meaningless fluff.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.469
Well, that's what pulled me in
at first, anyway.

23:47.513 --> 23:50.472
Thank God, because otherwise,
who knows where I would be?

23:50.516 --> 23:52.909
Probably a head of department

23:52.953 --> 23:55.999
at some backwater
community college.

23:56.043 --> 23:57.697
Cornell.

24:01.918 --> 24:04.704
You know, maybe there's
nothing wrong

24:04.747 --> 24:08.142
with a little razzle-dazzle.

24:08.185 --> 24:10.361
Just take that old
negative self-talk and...

24:10.405 --> 24:11.624
hiyah!

24:14.322 --> 24:16.150
Thank you.

24:16.193 --> 24:17.847
Thank you both.

24:17.891 --> 24:19.153
Mostly Olivia.

24:22.548 --> 24:25.638
This thinking cap of yours--
didn't I see it in your office

24:25.681 --> 24:27.509
with a price tag on it
last week?

24:27.553 --> 24:29.729
Oh, I may have embellished

24:29.772 --> 24:31.861
to get a very
sincere point across.

24:31.905 --> 24:34.168
-[chuckles]
-Well done.

24:34.211 --> 24:35.691
Oh, and, uh,

24:35.735 --> 24:38.085
well done also on that, uh,

24:38.128 --> 24:40.174
pathetic Craniac thing
you made up.

24:40.217 --> 24:41.871
Mm-hmm.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.049
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Why were you in my office?

24:46.093 --> 24:49.052
Oh, looking for the cat.
By the way,

your desktop Zen garden's
