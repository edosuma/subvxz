WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.007
â™ª

00:11.185 --> 00:12.534
But I need you.

00:12.577 --> 00:14.710
I don't believe you.
Prove it to me.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.929
Please, I can't do this
without you.

00:16.973 --> 00:18.975
What is the word
on the street these days

00:19.019 --> 00:20.933
about herringbone?

00:21.934 --> 00:23.762
-Not now, Dad.
-FRASIER: It's all right,
all right.

00:23.806 --> 00:26.678
I've got some options
in the downstairs closet here.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.332
I can't do this alone.

00:28.376 --> 00:31.074
So tell me, are you in
or are you out?

00:31.118 --> 00:32.509
Because if I
walk out that door...

00:32.554 --> 00:34.686
Is houndstooth too whimsical?

00:36.427 --> 00:38.038
Please, Dad.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.693
Because if I walk out that door
and you follow me,

00:41.737 --> 00:44.261
maybe...

00:44.305 --> 00:45.654
we'll start a movement.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.355
I want to love it. I do.
I-I do, we ju... I'm just...

00:51.399 --> 00:54.793
-I'm not buying you in the role.
-Oh, what do you know? You...

00:54.837 --> 00:56.926
You're judging me
on an acting scale

00:56.969 --> 00:58.884
of one to Backdraft.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.147
Backdraftis
a cinematic masterpiece.

01:00.190 --> 01:01.974
No, Backdraftis fire porn.

01:02.018 --> 01:04.715
Now, I know
what you two are thinking:

01:04.760 --> 01:08.068
"here comes the Harvard lecturer
in his hackneyed tweed."

01:09.417 --> 01:12.333
No, but I was thinking,
"How long is it gonna

01:12.376 --> 01:14.422
take my dad to mention
he's teaching at Harvard?"

01:14.465 --> 01:16.511
Under a minute. It's impressive.

01:17.555 --> 01:19.818
So, just a bit longer than
you actually attended Harvard?

01:21.646 --> 01:23.822
So, mock me if you will,
but this is the beginning

01:23.866 --> 01:25.476
of a new academic era for me.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.783
Frasier Crane is stepping
into a world where he can

01:27.826 --> 01:30.742
-impart wisdom
and influence young minds.
-FREDDY: Okay, Dad,

01:30.786 --> 01:33.354
no one loves hearing
Frasier Crane talk about

01:33.396 --> 01:35.007
Frasier Crane more than I do,

01:35.051 --> 01:37.532
-but Eve's got
a big audition this week.
-Mm-hmm.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.751
It's a play about a girl
who works at a slaughterhouse

01:39.795 --> 01:41.884
and she convinces her coworkers
to unionize

01:41.926 --> 01:45.192
through passion, grit
and a push-up bra.

01:45.235 --> 01:47.324
Well, if the dialogue
I overheard was any indication,

01:47.368 --> 01:49.413
then the cows
are the lucky ones.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.329
Dad, could you just...

01:52.372 --> 01:53.983
could you give us
a little peace and quiet?

01:54.026 --> 01:55.680
Oh, I'm sorry, yes,
if only Eve had a place

01:55.723 --> 01:57.291
where she could be on her own.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.293
Perhaps someplace that
I've already paid for,

01:59.336 --> 02:01.121
just directly across the hall.

02:01.164 --> 02:02.905
Oh, wait,

02:02.948 --> 02:04.472
aren't you late for the
boarding school where you teach

02:04.515 --> 02:07.083
unruly adolescents
the true meaning of poetry?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.780
[knocking]

02:08.824 --> 02:11.696
I'll have you know
tweed's sophisticated wool

02:11.740 --> 02:14.699
and sensible elbow patches
are emblematic

02:14.743 --> 02:17.049
of the intellect
and compassion it takes

02:17.093 --> 02:18.834
to inspire young minds.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.141
Are we twinsies?

02:22.403 --> 02:23.621
I'll change.

02:26.537 --> 02:28.017
Don't you have class right now?

02:28.060 --> 02:29.671
I'm here to take your father
under my wing

02:29.714 --> 02:31.586
and help him navigate
his first week at Harvard.

02:31.629 --> 02:34.023
I'll be the Sancho Panza
to your Quixote.

02:34.066 --> 02:35.329
All right, David.

02:35.372 --> 02:37.591
You know, I know
my way around Harvard.

02:37.635 --> 02:39.246
After all,
I did go to school there.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.204
Wait, you did?
'Cause I don't think

02:41.248 --> 02:42.727
you've ever
told us that story before.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.991
See, now, that's good acting.

02:53.434 --> 02:56.828
Well, if it isn't world-renowned
psychiatrist, TV personality

02:56.872 --> 03:00.528
and newly minted Harvard
educator Dr. Frasier Crane.

03:00.571 --> 03:03.705
Please, we're friends.
Just call me world-renowned.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.577
And to what
do I owe the pleasure?

03:06.621 --> 03:07.839
Oh, as I told Alan, I came here

03:07.883 --> 03:09.319
to christen my newest ship.

03:09.363 --> 03:11.365
And I thought that meant
there'd be champagne.

03:11.408 --> 03:13.497
So I brought you a cappuccino.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.891
You can imagine
my disappointment.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.371
Welcome aboard.

03:17.414 --> 03:19.024
It's been years
since I've had anyone here

03:19.068 --> 03:22.114
with any passion, excitement
or even vital signs.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.293
-I-I also brought you this.
-Oh.

03:26.336 --> 03:29.992
Oh, a replica "thinking cap"
from my old talk show.

03:30.035 --> 03:32.864
How fun.

03:32.908 --> 03:35.692
Oh, he students will go nuts
if you break it out for them.

03:35.737 --> 03:38.000
Yes, well, you know,
I've put all that behind me.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.610
Gone are the days
when I would dole out

03:39.654 --> 03:41.438
ridiculous advice
to my TV audience.

03:41.482 --> 03:44.311
Sure, sure.
You-you don't have to use it.

03:44.353 --> 03:46.356
It's custom made,
overnight shipping.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.706
The point is,
we're so glad you're here.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.055
Glad?
Thanks to your popularity,

03:51.100 --> 03:52.928
hardly any students
have signed up for my class,

03:52.971 --> 03:54.277
so I'm ecstatic.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.544
[student whoops]

04:03.155 --> 04:04.374
Look around, uncle.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.550
You are the rosy-cheeked
debutante at

04:06.594 --> 04:07.899
this ball of the brains.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.292
I am the strapping,
young cadet...

04:09.336 --> 04:10.337
-Go sit down, David.
-Okay.

04:12.687 --> 04:16.995
Welcome to
a History of Psychology.

04:17.039 --> 04:19.519
In this semester, I will be
your Virgil, leading you

04:19.563 --> 04:21.522
not through the circles of Hades
but through the...

04:21.565 --> 04:23.524
Excuse me.
I have a question.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.177
Oh, well, I can ramp back into

04:25.221 --> 04:27.092
my Virgil speech in a moment.
Uh, yes?

04:27.136 --> 04:30.139
I think my boyfriend
might be cheating on me.

04:30.182 --> 04:32.183
Should I confront him?

04:33.795 --> 04:35.579
Well, I...
I am sorry to hear that,

04:35.623 --> 04:37.755
but, uh, this is not
my old TV show.

04:37.799 --> 04:40.976
I'm not giving out any
personal advice. Uh... Yes?

04:41.019 --> 04:43.457
I have your first
call-in question.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.024
She's from Phoenix, Arizona.
She's my mom.

04:46.068 --> 04:48.026
She wants to know
if you're as handsome in person

04:48.070 --> 04:49.637
as you were on TV.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.595
[chuckling]

04:51.639 --> 04:54.163
That is not for me to say.

04:54.206 --> 04:56.948
Peoplemagazine said,
"Yes, absolutely," but...

04:56.992 --> 04:58.341
we're getting off track.
Now, now,

04:58.385 --> 05:00.517
to our-our first lecture.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.345
What made

05:02.389 --> 05:05.348
Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt tick?

05:05.392 --> 05:07.437
Hmm?
Our story begins

05:07.481 --> 05:09.439
-in Mannheim, Germany.
-DAVID: Uncle,

05:09.483 --> 05:11.354
this guy's not taking notes.
He's Googling you.

05:11.398 --> 05:14.139
Stop searching
"Frasier Crane height."

05:14.183 --> 05:15.924
It's all right, David.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.317
No, it's not okay.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.579
Why does he need to know
your net worth?

05:18.622 --> 05:20.276
A man's true value
has always be...

05:20.320 --> 05:22.365
Oh, my God, uncle,
you're like a Rockefeller.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.236
[students murmuring]

05:24.280 --> 05:27.239
Kind of makes your Christmas
gifts seem ungenerous.

05:28.284 --> 05:30.678
All right, all right.
That's enough, that's enough!

05:30.721 --> 05:33.376
I'd like to make one thing
absolutely clear.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.987
This class will have
nothing to do with my career,

05:36.031 --> 05:38.120
my public life
or my old TV show.

05:38.163 --> 05:41.515
I am here to lead you on
a challenging academic odyssey.

05:41.558 --> 05:44.692
And if you are here
for any other reason...

05:45.780 --> 05:47.782
...then I invite you
to leave now.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.189
Great.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.585
Well, we've

06:08.629 --> 06:10.544
separated the
wheat from the chaff.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.328
Now...

06:13.460 --> 06:15.331
...are there any
serious questions?

06:18.203 --> 06:19.640
I'm six foot, one.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.383
Tried to finish the lecture.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.167
As I continued to talk,
their eyes

06:25.210 --> 06:27.517
just started to glaze over
as if they weren't even...

06:32.261 --> 06:33.480
Alan.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.439
-Alan!
-Mm?

06:36.483 --> 06:38.267
Yeah, I'm glad
it went so smoothly.

06:38.310 --> 06:41.009
-Another triumph.
-No. No.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.576
I failed.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.707
I wanted them to take me
seriously as a professor,

06:44.752 --> 06:47.450
and they rejected me,
completely.

06:47.494 --> 06:51.280
If you would just stop trying,
I promise you will stop failing.

06:52.847 --> 06:56.590
Dr. Crane, I just left
the registrar's office.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.592
Eight students withdrew
from your class today.

06:58.635 --> 07:00.158
Olivia, please.

07:00.202 --> 07:01.943
Frasier's taking this
hard enough as it is.

07:01.986 --> 07:03.597
Most of them then signed up
for your class.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.425
Damn it, Frasier,
get your act together!

07:06.861 --> 07:08.253
OLIVIA:
What happened?

07:08.297 --> 07:09.864
I thought you'd be
natural at teaching.

07:09.907 --> 07:12.170
You have decades of experience
in TV and radio.

07:12.214 --> 07:14.042
But that's not teaching.
That's entertainment.

07:14.085 --> 07:15.522
I'm not a dancing bear.

07:15.565 --> 07:18.089
Oh, no one thinks of you
as a dancing bear.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.483
But universities have changed
since you were a student here

07:20.527 --> 07:23.138
for... thir... twe... for...
several decades ago.

07:24.748 --> 07:27.621
Students today
need a little showmanship.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.057
That's where you come in.

07:29.100 --> 07:32.234
You make the hard ideas
go down easy.

07:32.277 --> 07:33.801
[chuckles]

07:33.844 --> 07:36.368
So, I'm the cheese
wrapped around a dog's pill?

07:37.369 --> 07:38.632
Yes, you get it.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.460
Now, if you could just see

07:40.503 --> 07:43.985
how enthusiastically
the students would react

07:44.028 --> 07:46.291
to just a little glimpse
of the old you,

07:46.335 --> 07:47.902
I know you would
change your mind.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.120
I'm not changing my mind.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.341
Okay, but we still
need you to succeed.

07:52.384 --> 07:54.038
We are paying you
a lot of money.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.431
You're paying me almost nothing.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.477
Which is a lot of money
in academia.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.523
It is all about the numbers.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.090
And if you do not bring more
students into this department,

08:02.133 --> 08:03.526
well, then the numbers
are not good.

08:03.570 --> 08:04.962
What do you suggest?

08:06.007 --> 08:08.270
Uh, well,
this is a new career for you,

08:08.313 --> 08:10.490
so maybe you would benefit
from some seasoned help.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.667
-That sounds reasonable.
-That's perceptive.
-Mm-hmm.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.538
So, until you get your sea legs,

08:15.582 --> 08:17.192
why don't you co-teach
your classes with Alan?

08:17.235 --> 08:18.846
-Well, that's ridiculous.
-What is wrong with you?

08:18.889 --> 08:20.804
My goodness.

08:20.848 --> 08:23.111
Alan is-is lazy.

08:23.154 --> 08:24.982
He doesn't even finish
anything he starts.

08:25.026 --> 08:26.854
And Frasier is...

08:26.897 --> 08:28.159
Eh.

08:33.861 --> 08:36.167
What do you say, Alan--
is it worth a try?

08:36.211 --> 08:37.821
Well...

08:37.865 --> 08:40.302
Please, Alan,
help me help Dr. Crane help

08:40.345 --> 08:43.000
the next generation of people
who will help other people.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.656
Sounds like a Ponzi scheme
of benevolence.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.180
Are you really saying

08:49.224 --> 08:51.792
I should take on extra work
without extra pay?

08:51.835 --> 08:54.490
I am saying that you should help
your oldest and dearest friend.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.145
Without extra pay.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.757
You can bring your cat
back to the office.

09:01.758 --> 09:03.891
Fine, I'll do it.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.545
Anything for a dear friend.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.808
You're talking about your cat?

09:07.851 --> 09:10.114
Well, who do you think
I was talking about?

09:15.642 --> 09:17.295
You in a hurry to get home
to get your cat?

09:17.339 --> 09:19.559
No, no, that would be silly.

09:19.602 --> 09:20.734
Frasier Crane,

09:20.777 --> 09:22.649
meet Margaret Scratcher.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.785
Now, if I may,

09:28.829 --> 09:31.614
what's so offensive
about being a dancing bear?

09:31.658 --> 09:35.183
You're a natural showman.
Why not use that talent?

09:35.226 --> 09:36.401
I don't want to be
a showman anymore.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.273
I want to make an impact.

09:38.316 --> 09:40.188
Well, didn't you make an impact
on your television program?

09:40.231 --> 09:41.755
Well, it's debatable.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.670
But then again, you know that.
You saw it.

09:46.847 --> 09:48.239
You did see my show, didn't you?

09:48.283 --> 09:49.632
Of course.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.547
B... Bits and pieces.

09:52.722 --> 09:54.376
I may have missed it.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.465
It was on for 14 years.

09:56.508 --> 09:59.642
Here, let me show you.

10:01.688 --> 10:04.778
Perhaps the real reason
you have not yet asked

10:04.821 --> 10:07.607
your daughter to forgive you

10:07.650 --> 10:10.044
is that you have not yet
forgiven yourself.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.700
[crying]

10:22.230 --> 10:25.189
Well, this is all
rather insightful.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.105
That was season one.

10:28.149 --> 10:29.629
Here's a clip from...

10:31.587 --> 10:32.806
...season 13.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.546
[lively music playing]

10:34.590 --> 10:35.678
â™ª Dr. Craneâ™ª

10:35.722 --> 10:38.072
â™ª He can fix your brainâ™ª

10:38.115 --> 10:41.075
â™ª Keep from going insane
and take away the painâ™ª

10:41.118 --> 10:43.555
â™ª Yeah, it's Doctor,
Dr. Crane.â™ª

ANNOUNCER:
Oh, Doctor!

10:45.645 --> 10:48.038
[whooping, cheering]

10:54.741 --> 10:56.786
[laughing]

10:58.440 --> 11:00.181
How about that audience,
huh, Gilbert?

11:00.224 --> 11:02.662
Lovely, lovely, lovely!

11:02.705 --> 11:04.707
Welcome!

11:04.751 --> 11:06.753
Today on our show,
I will be delving

11:06.796 --> 11:10.147
into the mind of the world's
smartest pig,

11:10.191 --> 11:12.062
Albert Swinestein!

11:13.542 --> 11:15.718
Then, we'll unveil this week's

11:15.762 --> 11:19.026
-Frasier's Fra-vorite Things.
-[laughs]

11:19.069 --> 11:20.244
[applause, whooping]

11:20.288 --> 11:22.246
And Tom Arnold is here!

11:22.290 --> 11:23.726
[audience whooping]

11:25.510 --> 11:27.817
But first, let's put on...

11:27.861 --> 11:30.820
ALL:
...our thinking caps.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.474
[laughter]

11:37.566 --> 11:39.611
I see now why you may have felt

11:39.655 --> 11:41.831
that you'd lost your way.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.354
At one point...

11:44.399 --> 11:45.617
...I hawked a tinted moisturizer

11:45.661 --> 11:48.272
with the tagline...

11:48.316 --> 11:49.970
"I'm glistening."

11:52.668 --> 11:54.148
And that's why I quit.

11:54.191 --> 11:57.238
My show had devolved
into meaningless fluff.

11:57.281 --> 11:59.327
My greatest nightmare is that

11:59.370 --> 12:01.242
that will be my whole legacy.

12:01.285 --> 12:04.767
Are you sure this isn't less
about how people will see you

12:04.811 --> 12:07.030
and more about
how you see yourself?

12:07.074 --> 12:09.293
Don't you diagnose me
with your projection.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.252
It's merely a suggestion
of projection.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.471
I have an objection
to your projection suggestion.

12:13.515 --> 12:16.039
And I question your rejection
of my projection suggestion.

12:17.519 --> 12:20.652
But if you're intent on
avoiding the razzle-dazzle,

12:20.696 --> 12:23.351
then we'll have to win over
your class with substance.

12:23.394 --> 12:26.876
And I think I know the very
substance we should start with.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.226
Substance-- you're talking
about a drink, aren't you?

12:29.270 --> 12:31.359
Oh, you mean a book.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.578
How about that?

12:33.622 --> 12:35.319
Ah, I was right the first time.

12:40.237 --> 12:43.110
Oh, hi. How are you feeling
about your second class?

12:43.153 --> 12:45.068
Better.
Alan and I dug deep last night

12:45.112 --> 12:46.853
and came up with some things
I think you're really...

12:46.896 --> 12:50.030
That's fantastic.
Uh, so I sent Alan in already

12:50.073 --> 12:51.901
and, you know,
I hope it's okay--

12:51.945 --> 12:53.555
I futzed with the lighting
a little bit

12:53.598 --> 12:55.600
and I made a few other
little changes

12:55.644 --> 12:57.515
just to help you feel more
at home. You'll barely notice.

12:57.559 --> 12:59.169
Thank you. You're really
taking good care of me.

12:59.213 --> 13:01.171
Anything for my
"fra-vorite" teacher.

13:03.652 --> 13:04.827
Did you say "fra-vorite"?

13:04.871 --> 13:06.481
No.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.788
Oh, just one more thing.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.833
These doors are broken
or whatever.

13:10.877 --> 13:14.358
If you wouldn't mind
using the, uh, top entrance,

13:14.402 --> 13:15.795
just going around?

13:15.838 --> 13:17.231
Okay.

13:22.279 --> 13:24.281
[lively music plays on speakers]

13:24.325 --> 13:27.415
â™ª Dr. Crane,
he can fix your brainâ™ª

13:27.458 --> 13:29.634
â™ª Keep from going insane...â™ª

13:29.678 --> 13:31.593
It's my greatest nightmare!

13:31.636 --> 13:33.464
ANNOUNCER:
Oh, Doctor!

13:38.905 --> 13:41.037
Dr. Crane, where are you going?
You have class.

13:41.081 --> 13:42.560
Well, that makes one of us.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.390
You tricked me.

13:46.434 --> 13:49.002
No. No, no, no, no.
I tricked you and Alan.

13:49.045 --> 13:52.005
He had no idea
I had that planned.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.658
And I was hoping that
once you saw how excited

13:53.702 --> 13:56.009
the students were,
you would embrace the old you.

13:56.052 --> 13:58.489
You want the dancing bear,
don't you?

13:58.533 --> 14:01.144
No. What I want is a healthy
learning environment

14:01.188 --> 14:02.667
-for my...
-You want the dancing bear!

14:02.711 --> 14:04.278
Of course I want
the dancing bear!

14:04.321 --> 14:06.454
Why do you think I hired you--

14:06.497 --> 14:08.325
for your negligible
teaching experience?

14:08.369 --> 14:10.719
For the zero academic papers
that you've written?

14:10.762 --> 14:12.242
No.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.201
Because you are a big,
beautiful dancing bear

14:14.244 --> 14:17.421
in a pink tutu that the students
will actually pay attention to.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.337
That is why you are here.

14:20.381 --> 14:22.687
So dance, bear, dance!

14:23.950 --> 14:25.734
I refuse!

14:25.777 --> 14:27.388
I walked out of this job once
before and I'll do it again!

14:27.431 --> 14:29.390
Oh, no, Dr. Crane,
please, please.

14:29.433 --> 14:30.870
I put myself
on the line for you.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.697
The numbers are bad.
If you quit now,

14:32.741 --> 14:34.482
well, the numbers--
they're going to get worse.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.658
What are these numbers
you keep talking about?

14:37.702 --> 14:39.182
They're numbers.
And they're bad.

14:39.226 --> 14:41.141
This is Harvard!

14:41.184 --> 14:43.230
-For God's sake,
Harvard's endowment alone
-You see, the big numbers

14:43.273 --> 14:44.709
-could power a small country
-are little
and the little numbers

14:44.753 --> 14:45.754
-for centuries!
-should be big... Okay,

14:45.797 --> 14:46.668
it's not about the numbers,

14:46.711 --> 14:47.364
it's about my sister!

14:47.408 --> 14:49.236
All my life,

14:49.279 --> 14:51.368
she's been just
a little more popular,

14:51.412 --> 14:52.804
a little more successful.

14:52.848 --> 14:56.069
I don't know
if-if you've ever dealt

14:56.112 --> 14:58.245
with a-a sibling
with whom you have

14:58.288 --> 15:01.509
a very intense
and competitive relationship.

15:07.123 --> 15:09.169
I am familiar with the dynamic.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.172
I need your star power

15:12.215 --> 15:14.826
to finally beat my sister.

15:14.870 --> 15:17.655
She just made provost at Yale.
Yale,

15:17.699 --> 15:20.920
-Frasier, Yale!
-Don't you "Yale" at me!

15:25.794 --> 15:27.056
Okay, one more time.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.232
Can we take a break?
I'm exhausted.

15:29.276 --> 15:30.973
The last time I pushed
myself this hard,

15:31.017 --> 15:32.670
John popped out.

15:32.714 --> 15:34.672
You got to use it, okay?

15:34.716 --> 15:36.152
Y-You're supposed to be
at the end of your rope

15:36.196 --> 15:37.458
in this scene, right?
You got-you got to sound

15:37.501 --> 15:39.895
beaten down, pathetic,

15:39.939 --> 15:41.636
self-pitying, like no one

15:41.679 --> 15:44.334
on the face of the planet
believes in you.

15:44.378 --> 15:45.683
Do you have an example?

15:54.997 --> 15:56.738
Am I...

15:56.781 --> 15:59.480
destined to be a failure?

16:00.829 --> 16:03.049
One by one,
they've attached strings

16:03.092 --> 16:05.790
to my wrists and to my knees.

16:05.834 --> 16:08.402
I've been turned into a puppet.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.013
To dance at their behest.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.754
And once I've outlived
my usefulness,

16:12.797 --> 16:14.538
it's back in the box I go.

16:16.714 --> 16:20.022
Yeah.
So, that, but likable.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.371
I don't know.
I feel like the energy

16:21.415 --> 16:23.765
needs to be quirky and angrier.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.027
What?
What would that even look like?

16:25.071 --> 16:28.596
My ire is peaked.

16:30.685 --> 16:33.209
They booby-trapped you
in your own charisma.

16:33.253 --> 16:37.039
How dare they debase you
by forcing you to do

16:37.083 --> 16:41.043
the very thing you did
by choice for 15 years?

16:41.087 --> 16:43.002
I'm sorry, what is this about?

16:43.045 --> 16:44.220
-Allow me.
-Sit down, David.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.526
Okay.

16:47.789 --> 16:50.879
Things aren't working out
at Harvard.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.141
I'm thinking of leaving.

16:53.534 --> 16:54.796
Wow.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.755
Really?

16:57.799 --> 16:59.583
Oh, sorry, Dad,

16:59.627 --> 17:02.064
just so I have this
100% crystal clear--

17:02.108 --> 17:04.980
you're thinking
of dropping out...

17:11.117 --> 17:13.423
...of Harvard?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.686
I...
[sighs] Dad,

17:16.731 --> 17:19.560
do you think you gave Harvard
enough of a chance?

17:21.127 --> 17:22.911
You're just so bright, Dad.
I...

17:22.954 --> 17:25.695
I'd hate to see you waste
that kind of potential.

17:27.262 --> 17:29.483
Are you having trouble
making friends?

17:31.224 --> 17:33.008
Tell you what--
why not take a gap year?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.488
You know,
take a little time to...

17:34.531 --> 17:36.185
to think things over,
'cause, you know,

17:36.229 --> 17:37.578
I'm just worried about

17:37.621 --> 17:38.796
how this is gonna affect

17:38.840 --> 17:41.625
the rest of your life.

17:41.669 --> 17:44.019
What am I supposed
to tell my friends?!

17:48.284 --> 17:50.330
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

17:51.592 --> 17:54.464
Are you high on drugs?

17:58.294 --> 18:01.080
Very funny.
Very droll.

18:02.646 --> 18:03.995
You quite finished?

18:04.039 --> 18:05.823
No, Dad, I'm just kidding.
[chuckles]

18:05.867 --> 18:07.825
No one gets it more than I do.
Harvard's not for everyone.

18:07.869 --> 18:10.654
-It's-it's okay to give up.
-I'm not giving up.

18:10.698 --> 18:13.353
-No, I'm just saying there's
no shame in being a quitter.
-I'm not a quitter.

18:13.396 --> 18:17.096
Well, you quit your radio show,
you quit your TV show.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.749
Didn't you and Uncle Niles
once have a restaurant

18:18.793 --> 18:20.882
you quit after, like, one day?

18:24.451 --> 18:25.495
I'm not quitting, I just...

18:25.539 --> 18:27.062
I can't seem to figure out

18:27.106 --> 18:29.325
how to get my students
to take me seriously.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.893
You know, the character
I'm auditioning for--

18:31.936 --> 18:34.069
nobody takes her
seriously, either.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.679
Nobody except for Julius,

18:35.723 --> 18:38.378
the partially-blind
night shift custodian.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.597
And the way he talks about her

18:40.641 --> 18:43.687
allows others to see her
for the leader that she is,

18:43.731 --> 18:47.126
right up until he falls into
the industrial meat grinder.

18:49.867 --> 18:51.652
So...

18:51.695 --> 18:55.046
if I could find my Julius--

18:55.090 --> 18:56.918
one student with whom
I could engage

18:56.961 --> 18:58.224
in an inspiring conversation

18:58.267 --> 18:59.616
and thereby win over
the entire class.

19:00.661 --> 19:04.099
And I bet I know
just the Julius I need.

19:05.448 --> 19:08.190
I bet you do.

19:12.934 --> 19:15.197
After that brief
hiccup yesterday,

19:15.241 --> 19:17.721
I think it's time
we got back on track.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.723
Uh, but first,
does anyone have a question?

19:19.767 --> 19:21.247
I have a question.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.379
Anyone?
Anyone at all?

19:23.423 --> 19:25.642
Ah, yes, the young lady
in the back there.

19:25.686 --> 19:28.254
Yes, I have prepared a question
for you, Dr. Crane.

19:29.385 --> 19:32.040
Oh, wonderful.
Well, I'm excited to hear that.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.173
I'm your helper.

19:34.216 --> 19:36.697
I'm... I'm your...
I'm your Sancho Panza.

19:36.740 --> 19:39.526
It's about Hermann Ebbinghaus.

19:39.569 --> 19:42.485
Oh, yes, Ebbinghaus.
Oh, very interesting.

19:42.529 --> 19:45.488
You planned this without me.
You totally went over my head.

19:45.532 --> 19:48.448
Yes, and as a serious academic,

19:48.491 --> 19:50.972
could you tell me
what his whole deal was?

19:51.015 --> 19:53.496
And, please,
no gimmicky showmanship.

19:53.540 --> 19:57.196
Uh, excuse me... ma'am.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.546
Ma'am?
I'm not a ma'am.

19:59.589 --> 20:02.897
I'm a miss.
I'm a young, co-ed miss.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.377
Well, I'm convinced.

20:04.420 --> 20:07.510
Really? 'Cause you look like
an old mom.

20:07.554 --> 20:10.165
If I look old, it's because
somebody made me wear

20:10.209 --> 20:11.949
this stupid turtleneck.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.951
Oh, now,
as Ebbinghaus once said...

20:13.995 --> 20:15.649
Nobody is buying

20:15.692 --> 20:18.304
-this little act.
-Oh, yeah? Show of hands--

20:18.347 --> 20:20.001
who thinks I'm a student?

20:22.656 --> 20:24.266
Oh... Well, she-she's not.

20:24.310 --> 20:27.269
She's just a wannabe actress
who stole my moment.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.097
Wannabe?

20:29.140 --> 20:31.447
I have these dweebs
eating out of my hand.

20:31.491 --> 20:33.275
You took advantage of him,
didn't you?

20:33.319 --> 20:36.322
You took advantage
of this poor, gullible buffoon.

20:36.365 --> 20:40.108
Or maybe I'm here because
he knew that you couldn't do it.

20:40.151 --> 20:41.762
Well, go find your own uncle,

20:41.805 --> 20:44.155
'cause this one's mine!

20:44.199 --> 20:46.288
[chanting]:
Fight, fight, fight, fight,

20:46.332 --> 20:47.855
-fight, fight, fight,
-All right, all right.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.291
-fight, fight, fight...
-Everyone, calm down.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.162
She's only here
because my uncle pays

20:51.206 --> 20:53.034
for an apartment
for her and her baby.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.906
All right, stop, stop!

20:57.778 --> 20:58.822
Everyone.

20:59.997 --> 21:02.130
I think it's time...

21:02.173 --> 21:05.307
we put on our

21:05.351 --> 21:07.266
-thinking caps.
-Thinking caps!

21:20.366 --> 21:22.542
Sounds like
your class went well.

21:22.585 --> 21:25.762
I was teaching next door
and the applause woke me up.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.766
Yes.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.942
I had them eating
out of the palm of my hand.

21:33.248 --> 21:35.511
Did manage to squeeze in

21:35.555 --> 21:37.557
20 minutes about
Hermann Ebbinghaus

21:37.600 --> 21:40.211
because of this silly hat,

21:40.255 --> 21:41.691
and a story I told them about

21:41.735 --> 21:44.607
Albert Swinestein's
quiz show scandal.

21:44.651 --> 21:46.653
So, why do you look so glum?

21:46.696 --> 21:49.830
Because this wasn't
who I wanted to be.

21:49.873 --> 21:51.919
Thirty years ago...

21:51.962 --> 21:54.617
I left Boston
with my tail between my legs.

21:55.879 --> 21:59.187
I had dreams
of returning, triumphant.

21:59.230 --> 22:01.015
Now those dreams
just keep slipping

22:01.058 --> 22:02.495
farther and farther away.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.454
It's a rather fetching hat.

22:05.498 --> 22:07.195
May I have a look?

22:08.849 --> 22:10.416
Ow!

22:10.459 --> 22:11.634
What was that for?

22:11.678 --> 22:13.941
For being a baby.

22:13.984 --> 22:17.031
You're rich, you're famous,
your students love you.

22:17.074 --> 22:20.034
For some reason, you smell
naturally of sandalwood.

22:21.078 --> 22:22.558
What more
could you possibly want?

22:22.602 --> 22:24.255
I wanted to make an impact.

22:24.299 --> 22:26.432
Wanted to realize
the potential I had

22:26.475 --> 22:28.521
when I set out on this
career path 40 years ago.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.437
I see.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.744
That's a rather fetching belt.
Do you mind if I have a look?

22:36.180 --> 22:37.921
Am I being that ridiculous?

22:37.965 --> 22:40.228
You got 18-year-olds
to listen to a lecture

22:40.271 --> 22:42.839
about Ebbinghaus for 20 minutes,

22:42.883 --> 22:45.668
and all it took was a silly hat
and a story about a pig.

22:45.712 --> 22:47.583
Which, by the way,
I have to hear.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.587
[gasps]
â™ª Dr. Crane.â™ª

22:51.631 --> 22:53.546
Oh, it was marvelous!

22:53.589 --> 22:55.678
The students were raving.
You're a hit.

22:55.722 --> 22:59.682
Yes, Frasier was just
complaining about being beloved.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.555
Do you mind if
I take a look at this hat?

23:04.557 --> 23:05.949
Hmm.

23:05.993 --> 23:08.474
I have a little bit
of a confession.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.389
This thinking cap
wasn't shipped overnight.

23:10.432 --> 23:13.392
I bought it years ago when
I came to see your show live.

23:13.435 --> 23:16.264
You were a fan of the show?

23:16.307 --> 23:18.440
-Mm-hmm.
-You-you didn't mention that.

23:18.484 --> 23:21.051
It's a little bit
embarrassing, but

23:21.095 --> 23:24.533
I even ran my local chapter
of the Frasier Crane Fan Club.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.275
You were a Craniac?

23:31.671 --> 23:35.196
Watching you lift up
and educate your viewers--

23:35.239 --> 23:37.633
that's why I decided
to get my PhD.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.767
So, my show
actually inspired you,

23:40.810 --> 23:42.246
despite all
the meaningless fluff?

23:42.290 --> 23:45.119
[chuckles] Because
of the meaningless fluff.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.469
Well, that's what pulled me in
at first, anyway.

23:47.513 --> 23:50.472
Thank God, because otherwise,
who knows where I would be?

23:50.516 --> 23:52.909
Probably a head of department

23:52.953 --> 23:55.999
at some backwater
community college.

23:56.043 --> 23:57.697
Cornell.

24:01.918 --> 24:04.704
You know, maybe there's
nothing wrong

24:04.747 --> 24:08.142
with a little razzle-dazzle.

24:08.185 --> 24:10.361
Just take that old
negative self-talk and...

24:10.405 --> 24:11.624
hiyah!

24:14.322 --> 24:16.150
Thank you.

24:16.193 --> 24:17.847
Thank you both.

24:17.891 --> 24:19.153
Mostly Olivia.

24:22.548 --> 24:25.638
This thinking cap of yours--
didn't I see it in your office

24:25.681 --> 24:27.509
with a price tag on it
last week?

24:27.553 --> 24:29.729
Oh, I may have embellished

24:29.772 --> 24:31.861
to get a very
sincere point across.

24:31.905 --> 24:34.168
-[chuckles]
-Well done.

24:34.211 --> 24:35.691
Oh, and, uh,

24:35.735 --> 24:38.085
well done also on that, uh,

24:38.128 --> 24:40.174
pathetic Craniac thing
you made up.

24:40.217 --> 24:41.871
Mm-hmm.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.049
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Why were you in my office?

24:46.093 --> 24:49.052
Oh, looking for the cat.
By the way,

24:49.096 --> 24:52.926
your desktop Zen garden's
been compromised.

FRASIER:
Y'all know how this goes.

â™ª Hey, baby,
I hear the blues a-callin'â™ª

â™ª Tossed salads

25:12.336 --> 25:14.861
â™ª And maybe I seem
a bit confusedâ™ª

25:14.904 --> 25:17.472
Yeah, maybe.
But I got you pegged.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.604
[chuckles]

25:19.692 --> 25:21.607
â™ª But I don't know what to doâ™ª
