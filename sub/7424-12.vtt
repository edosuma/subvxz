01:56.624 --> 01:58.257
What?
Okay, Cat,

01:58.259 --> 02:00.459
I thought you said
you were done with bad boys.

02:00.461 --> 02:03.512
He's not a bad boy,
he is sweet and heroic and...

02:03.514 --> 02:04.830
Apparently abusive.

02:04.832 --> 02:07.049
It is not like that at all.

02:07.051 --> 02:09.384
We just had this really
deep connection

02:09.387 --> 02:11.704
and he understands me like
no one else.

02:11.706 --> 02:14.006
What happened to "he's an ass"?

02:14.008 --> 02:16.141
Yeah, and do you not think
we understand you?

02:16.143 --> 02:18.277

02:22.366 --> 02:25.317

to do that.

02:25.319 --> 02:26.568
What? Why?

02:26.570 --> 02:28.687
Because it's spiteful,
vengeful, vindictive?

02:28.689 --> 02:31.657
And you're afraid
he'd hate you forever.

02:31.659 --> 02:33.108
Yeah, see, we understand you.

02:34.527 --> 02:37.880
You're still hanging on.
No.

02:37.882 --> 02:39.197
You did just call him heroic.

02:39.199 --> 02:42.251
Okay, maybe
I'm hanging on a little.

02:42.253 --> 02:44.036
But I am not telling her.

02:45.221 --> 02:47.556
Besides, I am moving on,

Okay, I know this
is therapeutic for you,

03:01.072 --> 03:02.571
but these shows freak me out.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.039
Could you just turn
it down a little?

03:04.041 --> 03:06.108
I mean, even the narrators
voice is creepy.

03:07.545 --> 03:09.445
Maybe it's the neighbor.

03:11.248 --> 03:12.664
You know, if that's Ass,
you're not letting him in.

03:12.666 --> 03:15.117
It's not him.
He doesn't knock.

Who is it?

03:17.488 --> 03:18.704
Alex Salter.

03:18.706 --> 03:20.238
What?

03:20.240 --> 03:21.874
Um, nothing.
Just-just work.

03:21.876 --> 03:23.092
Coming.

03:23.094 --> 03:25.177
It's fine, all good.
Okay, well, hey,

03:25.179 --> 03:27.579
don't finish that ice cream.
You'll regret it in the morning.

03:34.938 --> 03:36.105
Hey.

03:36.107 --> 03:38.256
Sorry, it's so late.

03:38.258 --> 03:40.759
I just got done with my shift
and you're on my way home.

03:40.761 --> 03:42.327
No, I was up, so...

03:44.647 --> 03:48.317
Uh, that would be research
for a case.

03:48.319 --> 03:51.370
How did you get my address?

03:51.372 --> 03:52.621
Uh, from your
hospital file.

03:52.623 --> 03:53.906
Hope that's okay.

03:53.908 --> 03:55.324
Uh, no,
that's fine.

03:57.627 --> 03:58.994
That's my sister's.

03:58.996 --> 04:01.997
Um, so, what's up?

04:01.999 --> 04:03.966
Well, I wanted to ask

04:03.968 --> 04:05.250
if it would be okay to take

04:05.252 --> 04:06.835
Vincent away for the weekend?

04:06.837 --> 04:08.787
Uh...

04:08.789 --> 04:13.041
Because I know about his work
in Special-Ops.

04:13.043 --> 04:15.127
And that people have it
out for him.

04:15.129 --> 04:20.482
Okay, so, he told you
about... things.

04:20.483 --> 04:22.267
I hope that's okay.

04:22.269 --> 04:24.686
I mean, we were engaged once.

04:24.688 --> 04:26.271
No, no, no, no, that's good.

04:26.273 --> 04:29.158
Um, so did he tell you
anything else?

04:29.160 --> 04:33.362
You know, besides the fact that
people are after him?

04:33.364 --> 04:38.283
Uh, you mean that everyone is
supposed to think he's dead?

04:38.285 --> 04:39.518
Is there more?

04:39.520 --> 04:42.654
Nope, that-that seems like
plenty.

04:44.874 --> 04:46.491
Yeah, and I'm still not really
clear what the rules are,

04:46.493 --> 04:48.260
which is why I'm here.

04:48.262 --> 04:51.130
Before I brought up
this whole cabin idea to him,

04:51.132 --> 04:52.431
because you're his handler...

04:52.433 --> 04:55.333
Ah, you thought that you would
check in with me first.

04:55.335 --> 04:58.654
Yeah. I mean it'd-it'd just be
one night.

04:58.656 --> 05:00.722
My family has
a cabin upstate.

05:00.724 --> 05:01.840
It's totally isolated.

05:01.842 --> 05:03.025
It would just be the two of us.

05:03.027 --> 05:06.728
Sounds fun.

05:06.730 --> 05:09.031
Oh, my God.
It was out favorite place.

05:09.033 --> 05:10.449
You know, before.

05:10.451 --> 05:12.851
And we have
a lot to...

05:12.853 --> 05:14.520
catch up on.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.538
Yeah, like your plans to
move to Africa.

05:16.540 --> 05:20.425
So, he talked to you, too.

05:20.427 --> 05:22.294
I am his handler.

05:22.296 --> 05:25.948
It's just... strange.

05:25.950 --> 05:29.635
I've, uh, never had to share
him before.

05:29.637 --> 05:33.355
No. No, you're not sharing him.

05:33.357 --> 05:35.674
Uh, in fact,
in the future,

05:35.676 --> 05:37.092
you should probably go to him

05:37.094 --> 05:38.543
with all of
these sorts of things;

05:38.545 --> 05:42.047
these weekend
away kinds of things.

05:42.049 --> 05:45.334
You know, anything actually.

05:45.336 --> 05:47.236
Great.

05:47.238 --> 05:49.438
Yeah.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.524
All right, I'll just leave
you to your work.

05:52.526 --> 05:53.725
Have fun at the cabin.

05:53.727 --> 05:55.077

have to hide all the time,

07:04.131 --> 07:06.348
where I might actually get
to practice medicine again.

08:31.525 --> 08:33.091

08:33.092 --> 08:35.610
I was trying to be all tough and

08:35.611 --> 08:37.595

08:37.597 --> 08:38.813

08:38.815 --> 08:40.482
I don't,
I think he was wavering.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.768

and tell him not to go.

08:43.770 --> 08:45.453
No, no, no, no phone.
We're going to focus on work.

tipped off.

09:09.129 --> 09:11.479

let's raid her.

09:11.481 --> 09:13.598

09:13.600 --> 09:14.966

09:43.213 --> 09:45.130
They left for the cabin already.

09:45.132 --> 09:46.497
What?

09:46.499 --> 09:48.516
If his prints show up in the
system again...

09:48.518 --> 09:50.302
You know, if you really wanted
to protect him,

09:50.304 --> 09:51.836
you should've told him
not to go.

09:51.838 --> 09:53.805
I am not his handler.

09:53.807 --> 09:55.390
And you could've done
the same thing.

09:55.392 --> 09:57.892
I tried.
Meanwhile, I am protecting him.

09:57.894 --> 09:59.444
You know your little pal Evan

09:59.446 --> 10:01.896
is 12 hours away from presenting
his cross-species

10:01.898 --> 10:06.017
DNA findings to the National
Genetics Association.

10:06.019 --> 10:08.186
Okay, we are going to do this
raid in 49 minutes.

10:08.188 --> 10:09.321
Vincent's not picking up
his burner.

10:09.323 --> 10:10.989
Do you have Alex's number?

10:10.991 --> 10:13.325
No, and there is no cell phone
reception up at the cabin.

10:13.327 --> 10:15.827
Where does she live?
I'll go.

10:15.829 --> 10:17.462
Yeah, and leave your
fingerprints

10:17.464 --> 10:19.197
all over that place? No.

10:19.199 --> 10:20.548
I've already been there
and I know

10:20.550 --> 10:22.384
where all of the mementos
and letters are.

10:22.386 --> 10:25.703
You sure you want to do that?

10:25.705 --> 10:27.172
Want to? No.

10:27.174 --> 10:31.426
But I don't have a choice.

We're about to leave.
Hey.

11:27.818 --> 11:28.950
You close?

11:28.952 --> 11:30.785
Uh, yeah, I'll meet you there.

11:30.787 --> 11:32.937
Did you go see him?

11:32.939 --> 11:36.408
No, I am moving on.

11:36.410 --> 11:38.609
I will see you there.

11:45.051 --> 11:47.052
I swear, every time
I'm on this highway,

11:47.054 --> 11:48.619
I crave a strawberry
milkshake.

11:48.621 --> 11:51.005
Well, we can stop if you want.

11:51.007 --> 11:52.140
Is that allowed?

11:52.142 --> 11:53.925
Yeah.

11:53.927 --> 11:55.793
You don't have to clear that
with my handler.

11:55.795 --> 11:59.264
Oh, no, should I not have?

11:59.266 --> 12:02.100
No, it's fine. There's probably
some things we should talk about

12:02.102 --> 12:03.634
if, you know,
we're gonna move forward.

12:03.636 --> 12:05.820
"If"?

12:05.822 --> 12:08.356
Sorry, when. When.

12:08.358 --> 12:10.575
Yeah, I know, I know.

12:10.577 --> 12:12.610
There's so much that
I have to figure out.

12:12.612 --> 12:14.863
When I'm gonna give
work two weeks notice,

12:14.865 --> 12:16.748
what I'm gonna do
with my apartment.

12:16.750 --> 12:20.919
But you're not talking
about my logistics, are you?

12:20.921 --> 12:22.954
Uh, no, not exactly.

12:22.956 --> 12:24.656
It's just...
What?

12:24.658 --> 12:26.324
Watch the road, the road.
What?

12:26.326 --> 12:28.009
Watch the road.

12:28.011 --> 12:30.178
Sorry. I hate driving.

12:30.180 --> 12:31.763
I don't get to look at you.

12:31.765 --> 12:33.831
Okay, talk to me.

12:33.833 --> 12:38.436
Okay, uh,
what about the flight?

12:38.438 --> 12:40.688
The flight?
Yeah, it's not

12:40.690 --> 12:42.140
just a passport issue.

12:42.142 --> 12:45.226
I mean, there's cameras
and security and dogs.

12:45.228 --> 12:46.677
There are sick
people everywhere.

12:46.679 --> 12:48.780
We could go somewhere
we could drive to.

12:48.782 --> 12:51.816
Central America, Mexico.

12:51.818 --> 12:55.203
You know how much
I love margaritas.

12:55.205 --> 12:56.871
Yes, I do.

12:56.873 --> 13:00.575
All right, let's just start
with a milkshake.

13:00.577 --> 13:03.545
I'll never say no
to a milkshake.

13:03.547 --> 13:04.913
Watch the road.

13:04.915 --> 13:07.282
Road, right, right.

13:14.340 --> 13:16.341
Nothing so far.

13:16.343 --> 13:18.042
She has pill bottles
in the bathroom,

13:18.044 --> 13:19.511
but they all have
legit prescriptions.

13:19.513 --> 13:21.262
Oh, well, next raid.

13:21.264 --> 13:22.713
But I found this.

13:22.715 --> 13:24.382
New lingerie.

13:24.384 --> 13:25.883
Maybe she has a boyfriend.

13:25.885 --> 13:28.353
Or maybe she bought herself
some new bras?

13:28.355 --> 13:30.555
Not according to the receipt.

13:31.890 --> 13:33.241
Maybe he's an ass, too,

13:33.243 --> 13:34.692
and look, if he's in
on the drug thefts,

13:34.694 --> 13:36.327
she could hide the stash
at his place.

13:36.329 --> 13:37.495
It just... it seems like

13:37.497 --> 13:38.830
a bit of a stretch.
Yeah, but if

13:38.832 --> 13:41.449
we could just find
out who he is...

13:43.202 --> 13:44.669
Okay, you're right.

13:44.671 --> 13:46.337
You check the kitchen;
I'll finish up here,

13:46.339 --> 13:48.406
and whoever finds something last
has to buy ice cream.

13:48.408 --> 13:50.742
How about cocktails?
Done.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.603
It's a bug.

14:18.605 --> 14:20.771
I can see that.

14:23.409 --> 14:25.076
You can speak;
I disabled it.

14:25.078 --> 14:28.329
What the hell was a bug doing
in her apartment?

14:28.331 --> 14:30.298
Obviously,
Muirfield's back.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.350
But how did they
get onto...

14:32.352 --> 14:34.168
Vincent attacked Alex's stalker.

14:35.421 --> 14:37.639
His DNA was probably
on the body.

14:37.641 --> 14:40.008
Okay, Evan cannot present today.

14:40.010 --> 14:41.759
Evan?

14:41.761 --> 14:43.961
JT, Muirfield might have heard
that Alex was going away

14:43.963 --> 14:45.563
to a remote cabin with Vincent.

14:45.565 --> 14:47.131
You better get up there.

14:47.133 --> 14:48.933
Me? No, no, no, no.

14:48.935 --> 14:51.302
I-I am not walking
into their little...

14:51.304 --> 14:53.788
I can't do it.
I have to figure out a way

14:53.790 --> 14:56.474
to stop Evan before he stands up
in front of 200 people

14:56.476 --> 14:58.809
and presents Vincent's
DNA reports to the world.

14:58.811 --> 15:01.846
Okay, but I already cleaned
her apartment,

15:01.848 --> 15:03.114
and there was lingerie.

15:03.116 --> 15:04.365
So you're not gonna
save him

15:04.367 --> 15:05.867
because he's with another girl

15:05.869 --> 15:07.619
because you told him
it was a good idea?

15:07.621 --> 15:09.487
I did not tell him
it was a good idea.

15:09.489 --> 15:11.039
I-I am supposed
to be moving on.

15:11.041 --> 15:13.591
I was trying to
take the high road.

15:13.593 --> 15:16.661
How about taking the Long Island
Expressway, exit 91.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.397
There was a small

15:19.399 --> 15:20.331
engagement party there.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.584
Seriously?
I'm sorry.

15:22.586 --> 15:24.269
I know how hard this is.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.837
I just hope they have
their clothes on

15:26.839 --> 15:29.507
when I get there.

15:41.331 --> 15:42.947
Is it like you remember?

15:42.949 --> 15:45.533
Yeah, actually, it is.

15:45.535 --> 15:47.985
You sound surprised.

16:04.753 --> 16:06.337
Feels like
it's even colder in here

16:06.339 --> 16:07.805
than it is out there.

16:07.807 --> 16:09.957
Yeah, I'll get the fire going, huh?
Okay.

16:09.959 --> 16:12.243
My parents
left champagne.

16:12.245 --> 16:14.745
I-I don't really drink anymore.

16:14.747 --> 16:16.564
Oh, it's healthier.

16:16.566 --> 16:18.516
Yeah.
Besides, it's too cold for champagne.

16:18.518 --> 16:20.067
Oh.

16:20.069 --> 16:22.987
Looks like
it might snow outside.

16:22.989 --> 16:25.706
No snow in Mexico.

16:25.708 --> 16:29.327
So how's your Spanish?

16:29.329 --> 16:32.180
Uh, it's pretty rusty.

16:36.535 --> 16:38.702
Look, Alex, uh...

16:38.704 --> 16:41.722
before we start laying down
all these plans,

16:41.724 --> 16:45.059
um, I need to finish
what I was trying to say before.

16:45.061 --> 16:47.061
Okay.

16:50.382 --> 16:52.850
Uh...

16:52.852 --> 16:56.437
There's a reason
why I've been in hiding.

16:56.439 --> 17:00.324
Are you worried
I'm gonna reveal your identity?

17:00.326 --> 17:02.343
Because someone could try
to beat it out of me.

17:02.345 --> 17:04.545
I wouldn't say a word.
Alex, it's about your safety.

17:05.580 --> 17:07.515
I know people are after you.

17:07.517 --> 17:09.517
I mean, that's why we're going
halfway around the world

17:09.519 --> 17:11.569
or to Mexico,
to leave it all behind.

17:11.570 --> 17:14.105
Some of it
we can't leave behind.

17:16.741 --> 17:18.776
Hey, I...

17:18.778 --> 17:20.895
I know there are risks,

17:20.896 --> 17:24.549
but I'm an E.R. nurse
in New York City.

17:24.550 --> 17:27.251
Nothing freaks me out.

17:27.252 --> 17:30.071
Vincent.

17:31.490 --> 17:33.307
I'm in.

17:36.928 --> 17:39.530
I'm gonna make dinner.

17:40.566 --> 17:42.149
Okay.

17:50.942 --> 17:52.660
Hi.

17:52.662 --> 17:54.045
Get your errand done?

17:54.047 --> 17:55.963
Yeah, just on my way
to New York General

17:55.965 --> 17:57.214
to follow up.

17:57.216 --> 17:58.633
No, Narcotics is already on it.

17:58.635 --> 18:00.167
Oh, and the boyfriend's
a dead end.

18:00.169 --> 18:01.752
Oh, good.

18:01.754 --> 18:04.622
I mean, just now we can have
some more down time.

18:04.624 --> 18:05.840
You sound weird.

18:05.842 --> 18:07.258
Is it the guy?

18:07.260 --> 18:08.676
Uh, kind of.

18:08.678 --> 18:10.794
All right, that's it.
I'm cancelling

18:10.796 --> 18:12.013
my plans with Mr. Married.

18:12.015 --> 18:13.264
You and I are hanging out.

18:13.266 --> 18:14.732
No, no, no, Tess, it's okay.

18:14.734 --> 18:18.269
I just really need
some time alone right now.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.187
All right, well, whatever
you do, don't call, um...

18:20.189 --> 18:22.440
I don't even know his name.

18:22.442 --> 18:24.975
At this point, why bother?

18:31.950 --> 18:33.751
Is it okay?

18:33.753 --> 18:35.620
Yeah, it's great.

18:35.622 --> 18:37.488
Well, that's good, 'cause
it's still only one

18:37.490 --> 18:40.257
of three dishes that I
actually know how to make.

18:42.094 --> 18:44.295
You sure you can't
have some wine?

18:44.297 --> 18:47.832
I was part of a...

18:47.834 --> 18:49.934
experiment in the military.

18:52.170 --> 18:54.488
Okay.

18:54.490 --> 18:56.557
It's just that, uh...

18:56.559 --> 18:58.893
Well,
it didn't go as planned,

18:58.895 --> 19:03.030
and that's what I needed
to tell you.at, uh...

19:05.784 --> 19:09.020
So-so what, do you have
post-traumatic stress or...

19:09.022 --> 19:10.304
Uh, no.

19:10.306 --> 19:11.822
It-it's more complicated.

19:11.824 --> 19:15.793
Um, I am more complicated.

19:15.795 --> 19:18.079
You're not.

19:18.081 --> 19:21.499
Maybe your circumstances
are, but I know you.

19:21.501 --> 19:23.501
No, you don't.

19:23.503 --> 19:25.202
You don't.

19:28.924 --> 19:32.009
I'm, uh, starting to feel like
you don't want to do this.

19:32.011 --> 19:33.394
I do.

19:33.396 --> 19:34.945
Then what?

19:34.947 --> 19:36.597
Does your handler not
think it's a good idea?

19:36.599 --> 19:39.049
Alex, I told you,
it-it's complicated.

19:39.051 --> 19:40.351
No, you said

19:40.353 --> 19:42.069
you were complicated.

19:42.071 --> 19:44.488
I don't know; look, I'm just...

19:44.490 --> 19:46.323
I'm trying to do
the right thing here,

19:46.325 --> 19:48.409
and I just... I want you to know
what you're getting into.

19:48.411 --> 19:51.562
Vince, I told you,

19:51.564 --> 19:53.864
I'm in.

19:53.866 --> 19:55.800
Look, people fantasize

19:55.802 --> 19:58.452
about leaving their
lives all the time.

19:58.454 --> 20:00.454
We actually get to do it.

20:00.456 --> 20:04.408
Go where nobody knows us.

20:04.410 --> 20:06.510
Start a clinic.

20:06.512 --> 20:09.013
Help people.

20:11.650 --> 20:14.852
I guess I could have
virgin margaritas.

20:23.528 --> 20:25.229
What?

20:25.231 --> 20:27.431
Shh.

20:28.433 --> 20:30.618
Wait here.

20:38.460 --> 20:40.611
Whoa.

20:41.897 --> 20:42.997
Hey.

20:42.999 --> 20:45.466
I guess you saw me coming.

20:45.468 --> 20:47.585
Yeah, uh...

20:47.587 --> 20:49.036
What's going on?

20:49.038 --> 20:51.222
I'm really sorry to bother you.

20:51.224 --> 20:53.007
It's just...
my truck broke down,

20:53.009 --> 20:55.426
and I'm completely
useless when it comes

20:55.428 --> 20:57.628
to this kind of thing--
I don't know a lug nut

20:57.630 --> 20:59.563
from a...
I don't even know.

21:01.783 --> 21:03.317
There's no cell service
around here.

21:03.319 --> 21:04.568
Tell me about it.

21:04.570 --> 21:06.771
Oh, where's your truck?

21:06.773 --> 21:08.305
A mile up the road, maybe.

21:08.307 --> 21:10.024
About to give up
when I saw the lights.

21:10.026 --> 21:12.660
Can I, uh, take your car?
Oh, of course.

21:12.662 --> 21:13.944
Thanks, man.

21:13.946 --> 21:15.412
Appreciate it.

21:15.414 --> 21:16.997
It's starting to get
really cold out here.

21:16.999 --> 21:20.668
Be right back, okay?
Okay.

21:28.710 --> 21:29.960
JT.

21:29.962 --> 21:31.328
Justin Timberlake, huh?

21:31.330 --> 21:32.513
I get that all the time.

21:32.515 --> 21:33.681
We need to talk.

21:33.683 --> 21:34.998
No, I don't need the DNA.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.267
I'm just gonna present
the cross...

21:36.269 --> 21:38.352
Cross-training.
I'm in, dude.

21:38.354 --> 21:40.888
I'll buy you a soda,
and we'll talk all about it.

21:43.525 --> 21:47.061
Please tell me "buying a sod""
isn't a euphemism for something.

21:47.063 --> 21:49.613
Yeah, for "your morgue
is potentially bugged."

21:49.615 --> 21:51.065
You have to stop.

21:51.067 --> 21:52.650
No more samples,

21:52.652 --> 21:55.402
no more, uh, analysis,
no presentations.

21:55.404 --> 21:57.705
I have to do that presentation
to get our grant.

21:57.707 --> 21:58.906
Forget the grant.

21:58.908 --> 22:01.191
Okay, I didn't want
to have to tell you,

22:01.193 --> 22:04.829
but... there's a secret
organization that's obsessed

22:04.831 --> 22:07.548
with the same creature
you've been studying.

22:07.550 --> 22:10.301
A secret organization?

22:10.303 --> 22:12.753
Yes, and they will stop
at nothing to keep others

22:12.755 --> 22:14.805
from finding too much out.

22:14.807 --> 22:16.307
♪ Dunh-dunh-dunh.

22:16.309 --> 22:19.143
I'm serious.
You need to walk away now.

22:19.145 --> 22:21.228
Or what, some science nerd's
gonna beat me up,

22:21.230 --> 22:23.597
make sure that I don't get
the grant first?

22:23.599 --> 22:25.683
They've spent billions and
billions of dollars developing

22:25.685 --> 22:28.752
genetic weapons.
And at any rate, who knows?

22:28.754 --> 22:30.521
Maybe this is something
they've created

22:30.523 --> 22:32.523
and they're just trying
to cover their tracks?

22:32.525 --> 22:35.609
There is way more at stake
than some measly grant.

22:35.611 --> 22:37.278
And you know this how?

22:38.113 --> 22:39.446
I just do.

22:39.448 --> 22:41.448
You just do? Right.

22:41.450 --> 22:46.003
Look, I know this sounds crazy,
and-and I have no proof, but...

22:46.005 --> 22:48.088
You know, my first set
of samples was stolen,

22:48.090 --> 22:49.573
my second was corrupted.

22:49.575 --> 22:52.042
I'm starting to think that I've
got a frustrated competitor

22:52.044 --> 22:55.262
working to derail my efforts so
he can get his own recognition.

22:55.264 --> 22:59.183
Wait, you think that I...?

22:59.185 --> 23:03.253
Okay, you have trust issues,
buddy.

23:03.255 --> 23:05.756
Me, Mr. "Secret Organization"?

23:05.758 --> 23:08.943
You know what, I'm gonna go work
on my preparation

23:08.945 --> 23:12.029
and my measly grant.

23:21.406 --> 23:22.673
Vincent?

23:22.675 --> 23:24.491
No, it's Catherine.

23:24.493 --> 23:27.628
Chandler.

23:27.630 --> 23:30.447
I'm sorry,
I tried calling.

23:30.449 --> 23:32.716
What are you doing here?

23:32.718 --> 23:35.786
I'm looking for Vincent.
It's urgent.

23:35.788 --> 23:37.338
He's not here right now.

23:38.256 --> 23:41.008
You want to come in?
It's freezing.

23:42.794 --> 23:44.178
Where is he?

23:46.965 --> 23:49.516
Is there something going on
between you two?

23:49.518 --> 23:51.385
Alex, that's not what
this is about.

23:51.387 --> 23:53.621
That wasn't a "no""

23:53.623 --> 23:56.023
I just need you
to tell me where he is.

23:56.025 --> 23:58.742
He just went to help some guy
with his truck. He'll be back.

23:58.744 --> 24:00.194
What guy? When was this?

24:00.196 --> 24:01.962
You just missed them.
He'll be right back.

24:01.964 --> 24:03.314
Okay, what direction
did they go in?

24:03.316 --> 24:04.765
I didn't notice.

24:04.767 --> 24:06.450
What-what's going on?
Is he in trouble?

24:06.452 --> 24:08.702
He might be-- that guy
could have been a trap.

24:08.704 --> 24:10.771
A trap? No. He seemed
totally harmless.

24:10.773 --> 24:13.223
And how would anyone even
know that we're here?

24:13.225 --> 24:16.994
There was a listening device
in your apartment.

24:16.996 --> 24:18.712
A what?

24:18.714 --> 24:20.564
Alex, he has a handler
for a reason.

24:20.566 --> 24:22.032
There are people
that are tracking him.

24:22.034 --> 24:26.186
You told me it was okay
to take him away.

24:26.188 --> 24:29.223
Because it wasn't my decision
to make, it was his.

24:29.225 --> 24:31.442
But he could've been more
clear with you.

24:31.444 --> 24:33.944
No, he has been clear, and
I've dealt with PTSD before.

24:33.946 --> 24:35.946
PTSD?

24:36.865 --> 24:39.900
Alex, I'm sorry,
but I have gotta go find him.

24:39.902 --> 24:41.568
Well, I'm coming with you.

24:41.570 --> 24:43.137
No, he left you here
for a reason.

24:43.139 --> 24:44.855
But if he's in trouble...

24:44.857 --> 24:46.857
You are staying here!

24:46.859 --> 24:50.744
He is protecting you
in more ways than you know.

24:50.746 --> 24:53.881
Here, take this.

24:53.883 --> 24:58.385
If anyone gets close
to you, use it.

25:13.173 --> 25:16.010
It's been making
<i>a weird noise for weeks.</i>

25:16.011 --> 25:18.962
I should've taken it in.
<i>I just kept putting it off.</i>

25:20.681 --> 25:22.499
Hey, what are we doing?

25:22.501 --> 25:25.118
The truck's up... Hey!

25:30.524 --> 25:33.259
How many?

25:33.261 --> 25:35.478
I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.096
Benny's Garage?

25:37.098 --> 25:40.016
Grease under your nails.
If your truck was

25:40.018 --> 25:42.485
really broken down,
you'd know how to fix it, right?

25:42.487 --> 25:44.821
Seriously, man, all I know
is that I was supposed

25:44.823 --> 25:46.606
to meet my girlfriend
an hour ago.

25:46.608 --> 25:48.491
How many?

25:48.493 --> 25:50.443
Dude, I don't...

25:51.780 --> 25:53.613
Three.

25:53.615 --> 25:55.498
What did they tell you?

25:55.500 --> 25:58.184
To get you to the truck.

25:58.186 --> 25:59.335
And then?

25:59.337 --> 26:00.837
They'd take it
from there.

26:00.839 --> 26:02.955
They gave me a thousand bucks.

26:02.957 --> 26:04.340
Told me they were bounty
hunters. I need the money.

26:04.342 --> 26:05.892
They're not
bounty hunters,

26:05.894 --> 26:09.846
and they don't like witnesses,
so I'd start running.

26:10.815 --> 26:12.332
What about my truck?

26:12.334 --> 26:13.650
Forget your truck.

26:13.652 --> 26:16.135
Just get as far away
from here as you can.

26:23.494 --> 26:26.496
This cloak-and-dagger
bit's wearing thin.

26:26.498 --> 26:28.665
Lila Burrows.

26:28.667 --> 26:30.750
Who?

26:30.752 --> 26:35.422
22-year-old female, blood clot,
ended up dying on your table?

26:35.424 --> 26:37.990
Surprised
you don't remember her,

26:37.992 --> 26:40.460
considering she's the reason
you left England.

26:40.462 --> 26:42.495
Records are sealed,
but when you're being

26:42.497 --> 26:45.165
tracked by a secret
organization,

26:45.167 --> 26:47.166
you acquire
basic hacking skills.

26:47.168 --> 26:49.602
I was cleared of everything.
Legally,

26:49.604 --> 26:51.855
but seems your conscience
couldn't take it.

26:51.857 --> 26:55.391
You left six weeks after
the suit was filed.

26:55.393 --> 26:57.393
You even changed specialties.

26:57.395 --> 26:59.529
No tragic loss of
life in a morgue.

26:59.531 --> 27:01.614
What's your point?

27:01.616 --> 27:04.317
That this is something you don't
want people to know,

27:04.319 --> 27:06.236
and I'll make sure they do,
unless...

27:06.238 --> 27:07.320
You're blackmailing me?

27:07.322 --> 27:08.688
I'm trying to save your life.

27:08.690 --> 27:10.673
I'm not asking for
money, just for you

27:10.675 --> 27:12.575
to find something else to research.
Or what?

27:12.577 --> 27:14.828
You're gonna go running around
the precinct spreading gossip?

27:14.830 --> 27:17.580
Those people are busy
solving actual crimes.

27:17.582 --> 27:20.884
This partnership, it's over.

28:19.860 --> 28:21.978
♪

28:42.883 --> 28:44.834
It's clear.

28:46.503 --> 28:48.788
What are you
doing here?

28:48.790 --> 28:50.957
I found a bug at Alex's.

28:50.959 --> 28:52.642
What?

28:52.644 --> 28:55.128
Narcotics did a raid
because of her clinic.

28:55.130 --> 28:57.513
You shouldn't be here,
Catherine, it's dangerous.

28:57.515 --> 29:00.800
So dangerous, you leave
your fiancée alone?

29:00.802 --> 29:02.418
I'm trying to keep it
away from her.

29:02.420 --> 29:04.671
Keep what away?
Whatever's out there,

29:04.673 --> 29:07.991
or the fact that
you might transform?

29:07.993 --> 29:09.809
You can't help it,
can you?

29:09.811 --> 29:12.579
Every interaction we have,
you have to constantly remind...

29:12.581 --> 29:14.113
Every interaction?
Yes.

29:14.115 --> 29:15.782
The other day
in the park,

29:15.784 --> 29:18.868
you said yourself,
it's who I am.

29:18.870 --> 29:20.286
You know that's not
what I meant.

29:20.288 --> 29:21.955
What about
your dad's wedding?

29:21.957 --> 29:23.890
You know, I show up,
we had one dance,

29:23.892 --> 29:25.157
you tell me to leave.

29:25.159 --> 29:27.677
I had just found out
you were mutating.

29:27.679 --> 29:29.629
No, my DNA was mutating,
not me.

29:29.631 --> 29:32.298
And then I came
after you.

29:32.300 --> 29:34.333
Vincent, from the first
moment I met you,

29:34.335 --> 29:37.053
I have seen you as a person,
and you know it.

29:37.055 --> 29:39.188
This is your issue,
it's not mine.

29:39.190 --> 29:42.141
I told Alex about
the experiment, okay?

29:42.143 --> 29:44.010
Yeah, she thinks
you have PTSD.

29:44.012 --> 29:47.146
That's the cover story I told
my girlfriends over karaoke.

29:47.148 --> 29:49.565
It's not a bad thing when

29:49.567 --> 29:52.068
someone knows the
darkest parts of you.

29:55.573 --> 29:56.739
They're here.

29:56.741 --> 29:58.124
How many?

30:03.564 --> 30:05.331
Three.

30:05.333 --> 30:07.467
Come on.
Okay.

30:42.799 --> 30:43.866
Get down!

31:45.495 --> 31:47.613
I retract what I said before.

31:51.584 --> 31:53.001
I'm glad you were here.

31:53.003 --> 31:57.122
I get that you want a different
kind of life.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.374
Yeah, but even though I try

31:58.376 --> 32:00.042
and get away,
they still find me.

32:00.044 --> 32:02.261
Vincent, I didn't want you

32:02.263 --> 32:05.330
to have to hide from Muirfield
<i>and</i> her.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.467
Wait.

32:08.469 --> 32:09.718
What?

32:18.328 --> 32:20.345
Alex...

32:23.783 --> 32:25.734
Stay away.

32:25.736 --> 32:27.870
Alex, it's okay.

32:27.872 --> 32:29.972
I saw you.

32:31.424 --> 32:33.325
I saw everything.

32:33.327 --> 32:34.743
Okay, just let me explain.

32:37.397 --> 32:39.248
Okay.
Alex...

32:39.250 --> 32:41.583
Alex, put the gun down.

32:41.585 --> 32:44.586
What you saw,
that isn't who he is.

32:44.588 --> 32:47.589
He's the same guy
you've always known.

32:47.591 --> 32:49.074
No.

32:49.076 --> 32:51.310
Trust me. Put the gun down.

32:51.312 --> 32:54.179
Come on, Alex,
put it down.

33:04.007 --> 33:06.158
It's okay.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.793
Okay, I'll be at the car.

33:15.452 --> 33:18.069
The experiment
that I told you about...

33:21.207 --> 33:23.025
Alex, they changed my DNA.

33:23.027 --> 33:26.378
You ripped those men apart.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.580
Please, I would never hurt you.

33:35.104 --> 33:36.638
Okay.

33:39.492 --> 33:42.744
I guess you know now why
I stayed away all those years.

33:42.746 --> 33:45.263
Is it permanent?

33:45.265 --> 33:48.700
I've been trying to find a cure.

33:48.702 --> 33:50.319
But, uh...

33:53.439 --> 33:54.857
Alex, I'm sorry.

33:54.859 --> 33:58.494
Okay, I-I just wanted
to go away with you.

33:58.496 --> 34:00.295
You know, somewhere peaceful
where we could help people.

34:00.297 --> 34:01.780
You know, I thought...

34:01.782 --> 34:03.832
I just thought it
wouldn't happen.

34:03.834 --> 34:06.735
I can't.

34:06.737 --> 34:10.054
We can't.

34:14.726 --> 34:17.579
I guess I got caught up
in a fantasy.

34:19.899 --> 34:23.902
I'm going to...
drive myself home.

34:23.904 --> 34:25.637
Yeah.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.320
You are so busted.

34:49.322 --> 34:50.938
You were with Ass,
weren't you?

34:53.324 --> 34:55.159
Oh, my God, what happened?

34:59.965 --> 35:02.333
What happened...

35:04.586 --> 35:05.886
...is he needed me.

35:05.888 --> 35:07.504
Cat...

35:07.506 --> 35:11.508
No. No,
I'm talking life and death.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.644
Oh, my God.
Seriously? Is he okay?

35:13.646 --> 35:18.249
Yeah, he's...
he's okay.

35:18.251 --> 35:19.934
For now.

35:21.853 --> 35:24.238
Cold turkey's so hard.

35:26.191 --> 35:30.160
Yeah, I know
I am supposed to be...

35:30.162 --> 35:33.414
strong and move on, but...

35:33.416 --> 35:36.150
But maybe being strong
is following your heart

35:36.152 --> 35:37.785
no matter what?

35:38.853 --> 35:41.021
Just my own little theory.

35:41.023 --> 35:42.706
I won't tell Tess.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.258
Tess might actually like
the theory.

35:44.260 --> 35:45.709
She's been calling all night.

35:45.711 --> 35:47.344
Some guy blew her off.

35:47.346 --> 35:48.963
Oh, no.

35:48.965 --> 35:50.214
Yeah, maybe you could bring over

35:50.216 --> 35:51.932
your leftover pint
of ice cream.

35:51.934 --> 35:53.717
I so do not want that in
our freezer.

35:55.554 --> 35:59.506
Actually, I have a better idea.

35:59.508 --> 36:02.610
What do you mean
you let Alex go?

36:02.612 --> 36:05.813
You think holding her hostage
was going to help the situation?

36:05.815 --> 36:07.231
What if she
tells someone?

36:07.233 --> 36:09.366
I-I mean, the cops
searched her apartment.

36:09.368 --> 36:10.901
They're going to
want to talk to her.

36:10.903 --> 36:12.870
You're right.

36:12.872 --> 36:14.521
While you were
frolicking in the woods,

36:14.523 --> 36:16.240
the cops got a warrant.

36:16.242 --> 36:18.075
Somebody noticed all
the medication

36:18.077 --> 36:19.827
Alex has been stealing for
the clinic.

36:19.829 --> 36:21.829
My prints...

36:21.831 --> 36:24.248
Catherine got rid of any trace.

36:24.250 --> 36:26.300
Oh, man.

36:27.335 --> 36:28.802
I am such an ass.

36:28.804 --> 36:30.754
Can't say I'm going to argue
with you there.

36:34.427 --> 36:36.844
Ah, get it, I got to go.

36:45.987 --> 36:47.855
Didn't expect to hear from you.

36:47.857 --> 36:49.273
I didn't expect to call,

36:49.275 --> 36:51.224
but I found a bug in my office.

36:52.577 --> 36:55.079
I'm assuming not a cockroach?

36:55.081 --> 36:59.116
I ran it for prints;
they're classified, the prints.

36:59.118 --> 37:02.252
Not to mention this is no
low-tech, inexpensive device.

37:02.254 --> 37:04.872
Look, uh, I'm not going to
lie to you,

37:04.874 --> 37:06.540
it's not great.

37:06.542 --> 37:08.676
It means you're on their radar.

37:08.678 --> 37:10.461
But...

37:10.463 --> 37:13.047
bright side, now you can take
precautions,

37:13.049 --> 37:14.414
protect yourself.

37:14.416 --> 37:16.383
Well, I canceled the
presentation.

37:16.385 --> 37:17.618
There goes your grant.

37:17.620 --> 37:19.803
Our grant.

37:19.805 --> 37:22.356
About that blackmail thing...

37:22.358 --> 37:25.476
I was just trying to get my
message across.

37:25.478 --> 37:28.896
I don't want anyone to know.

37:31.700 --> 37:34.451
But since you do...

37:34.453 --> 37:37.354
I send her family a
check every month.

37:38.406 --> 37:40.541
But you weren't found guilty.

37:40.543 --> 37:44.461
Doesn't mean I don't feel it.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.580
We all have skeletons.

37:46.582 --> 37:47.881
Care to elaborate?

37:47.883 --> 37:51.085
No.

37:51.087 --> 37:52.636
Point is, whatever happened,

37:52.638 --> 37:53.837
it's none of my business.

37:53.839 --> 37:56.306
Forget I ever mentioned it.

37:56.308 --> 37:57.758
Thank you.

38:22.700 --> 38:23.917
Hey.

38:23.919 --> 38:25.252
I'm actually just
heading out.

38:25.254 --> 38:28.405
Oh, this won't be long.

38:28.407 --> 38:32.009
Um, I just...
I need to say thank you.

38:32.011 --> 38:33.844
For what?

38:33.846 --> 38:36.947
For this?

38:36.949 --> 38:40.934
Your photos and letters
from Alex's apartment.

38:43.338 --> 38:45.022
You know, I keep
trying to move on,

38:45.024 --> 38:47.875
but it's kind of
difficult with you.

38:47.877 --> 38:50.811
I don't want you to.

38:53.181 --> 38:57.017
Catherine,
the things that I said about

38:57.019 --> 38:59.052
the way that you see me,
it was wrong, okay?

38:59.054 --> 39:00.954
It's my issue.

39:00.956 --> 39:03.540
I just, sometimes I wish
so badly...

39:03.542 --> 39:06.126
I wasn't what I am.

39:08.630 --> 39:11.682
Catherine, I know that I can't
be with someone

39:11.684 --> 39:14.268
who doesn't
know everything about me.

39:16.304 --> 39:17.971
She does now.

39:19.808 --> 39:25.312
Okay, who doesn't accept
everything about me.

39:25.314 --> 39:27.314
Vincent, I can't be your
second choice.

39:27.316 --> 39:29.433
You're not.
Really?

39:30.652 --> 39:32.886
Because if Alex
had accepted you,

39:32.888 --> 39:35.756
you... you'd be with
her right now.

39:35.758 --> 39:39.209
In that ridiculously
romantic cabin.

39:39.211 --> 39:40.878
Not happily.

39:40.880 --> 39:44.164
It was never about...

39:44.166 --> 39:47.034
taking off with Alex.

39:47.036 --> 39:49.086
It was about a better
future for me, okay?

39:49.088 --> 39:54.208
But I know now that that better
future isn't her, Catherine.

39:54.210 --> 39:56.643
It's you.

39:59.080 --> 40:02.850
I will do whatever it takes to
make this right.

40:04.285 --> 40:07.588
Vincent, there's nothing
you can do.

40:07.590 --> 40:10.274
Obviously now
that Muirfield's back

40:10.276 --> 40:14.127
and Alex knows,
I will help, but...

40:14.129 --> 40:17.331
But you and me...

40:18.533 --> 40:20.817
I need to protect myself
right now.

40:20.819 --> 40:23.871
Cat, come on.

40:25.790 --> 40:28.909
And I need to be there
for someone

40:28.911 --> 40:30.727
who's always there for me.

40:30.729 --> 40:33.297
Of course.

40:33.299 --> 40:34.665
Hey.

40:36.684 --> 40:39.169
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

40:45.243 --> 40:46.810
<i>I'm telling you,</i>

40:46.812 --> 40:48.345
I'm the worst singer
in the world.

40:48.347 --> 40:49.796
It didn't stop you
last time, come on.

40:49.798 --> 40:52.482
And, seriously, I am not
doing this by myself again.

40:52.484 --> 40:53.901
Fine, what did you request?

40:53.903 --> 40:55.852
That you and I stay
away from asses.

40:55.854 --> 40:57.637
It's not going to be easy--
he already texted.

40:57.639 --> 40:58.772
Don't text him back.

40:58.774 --> 41:00.657
What am I saying,
text him, don't text him,

41:00.659 --> 41:02.159
just know that if he breaks
your heart again, I'm here.

41:02.161 --> 41:04.745
I'm not heartbroken.
Back at you.

41:05.980 --> 41:07.647
It's starting.

41:07.649 --> 41:09.783
