12:04.164 --> 12:06.766
Did I at least come close?

12:13.742 --> 12:15.944
Turn left at the next intersection.

12:16.011 --> 12:18.480
[Horns honking, tires squealing]

12:21.618 --> 12:25.420
- How'd that go?
- Great.

12:26.456 --> 12:28.690

12:35.397 --> 12:37.465

12:37.532 --> 12:40.741
- How am I supposed to get in that?
- Get in it?

12:40.772 --> 12:43.049
All you asked was if
I had a valid driver's license...

12:43.089 --> 12:45.404
...to meet you at the DMV.
You wanted a ride?

12:45.421 --> 12:48.002
I'm not a taxi driver, man.
I'm in the middle of a lunch rush!

12:48.021 --> 12:50.656
[Tires squealing]

12:53.481 --> 12:55.249
Ayy!

12:55.316 --> 12:57.018

13:03.893 --> 13:06.060
Ayy. Gringos.

13:06.128 --> 13:08.663
[Tires squealing]

13:10.099 --> 13:13.101
SAM: So are we parallel parked?
- Mmhmm.

13:13.169 --> 13:17.839
SAM: This driver's test is graded
on a scale of one to a hundred.

13:17.907 --> 13:20.842
And considering the type
of driving you just did.

13:20.890 --> 13:23.824
What grade would you give yourself?
- Hundred.

13:23.979 --> 13:26.547
SAM:
I get that one a lot.

13:36.870 --> 13:39.426
Ohh, this is embarrassing.

13:39.494 --> 13:41.556
- Next!
- Hi!

13:41.572 --> 13:45.766
Cool your jets, blondie.
I'm a real stickler.

13:56.646 --> 13:58.647
"Yose-Mite".

13:58.714 --> 14:01.917
- It's Yosemite.
- Oh, like the National Park!

14:01.940 --> 14:04.114
You know, I was named
after a National Park.

14:04.153 --> 14:08.444
Oh, no, wait. Sorry. I wasn't named after a National Park.
I was named after my grandmother.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.682
Oh, no, wait, my grandmother's
name is Betty, not Lola.

14:10.697 --> 14:12.546
Wait, there's a National Park named Betty?

14:12.585 --> 14:15.355
- Can you just take a right?
- A right?!

14:15.356 --> 14:18.658
[Scoffs] Yose-Mite, I just got a
perfect score on my written test.

14:18.666 --> 14:21.712
I think I can do a little more
than take a right.

14:21.894 --> 14:24.829
[Tires squealing]

14:40.490 --> 14:42.857

15:28.636 --> 15:30.938
Did I pass?

15:31.005 --> 15:34.107
Hello?!

15:34.175 --> 15:36.142
Yeah, I passed.

15:37.410 --> 15:41.316
Oh, now I know why you look familiar.
You're Bugs' neighbor!

15:41.317 --> 15:44.215
He told me so much about you.
He's not a fan.

15:46.686 --> 15:49.045
I can't believe they named a
National Park after that guy.

15:50.189 --> 15:52.323

16:01.537 --> 16:04.068
- You get your license?
- I failed.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.774
Twice!

16:05.871 --> 16:07.872
So you'll take the test again next week.

16:07.940 --> 16:10.707
[Stammers] No way. I'm done driving.

16:10.775 --> 16:15.562
The only people who deserve a driver's license
are responsible, law-abiding citizens...

16:15.585 --> 16:17.374
...who know the rules of the road.

16:17.447 --> 16:21.450
Oww! Licensed driver, comin' through!

16:21.518 --> 16:26.622
Whoo! Outta my way!
Licensed driver, 100%!

16:26.689 --> 16:29.057
Well, there's an exception to every rule.

16:29.125 --> 16:32.428
I've got my driver's license! Whoo-hoo!

16:32.496 --> 16:34.627
- Maybe two exceptions.
- Look, bun bun!

16:34.670 --> 16:38.632
I'm an organ donor. Are you an organ donor?
You wanna give each other our organs?

16:38.670 --> 16:41.211
- Ehh...
- Well, we can decide later.

16:41.212 --> 16:45.309
You ready to go?
Be my first passenger as a licensed driver?

16:45.377 --> 16:47.543
Thanks, but I have to drive Porky home.

16:47.581 --> 16:49.056
He didn't pass.

16:49.071 --> 16:51.486
Oh, stay strong. You'll get through this.

16:51.487 --> 16:55.989
I know, I've been there. But I'm not there anymore.
Whoo-hoo! Driver's license!

17:00.791 --> 17:04.094
How do you get out of this place?
Here we go!

17:05.296 --> 17:07.464
PORKY:

17:09.971 --> 17:13.137
