because my father
didn't hug me enough.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.591
And you know what?
I think he was right.

17:38.625 --> 17:42.762
Trust me. You weren't there
to see how heartbroken he was.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.464
He was just staring
at the wall.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.766
And then he dipped his mug
in black paint.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.735
And he had spent
so much time

17:48.768 --> 17:51.471
making sure that
the parasols were to scale.

17:51.504 --> 17:52.539
And, damn it,
they were,

17:52.572 --> 17:54.441
and he was just so sad,

17:54.474 --> 17:56.276
and I just hated
seeing him like that.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.345
And Evan's just not ready
to date!

18:00.647 --> 18:03.550
It, um, kind of
seems like maybe

18:03.583 --> 18:05.618
you're not ready
for Evan to date.

18:08.155 --> 18:11.424
Jessica, this week, I met
a couple named Mom and Pop.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.926
Those old people you drove out
of town with your restaurant?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.128
Yes and no.

18:15.162 --> 18:17.164
Anyway, before
they threatened to sue me...

18:17.197 --> 18:18.631
What?
It's all taken care of.

18:18.665 --> 18:19.999
The point is,
it's no one's fault,

18:20.032 --> 18:22.101
but Mom and Pop's life
has been a living hell,

18:22.135 --> 18:24.404
and they stayed together
through it all.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.938
Life's a lot easier
to handle

18:25.972 --> 18:27.807
with a partner you love
by your side.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.277
I never would have
gotten through

18:30.310 --> 18:31.578
moving to Orlando
without you.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.979
And I never would have
gotten through

18:33.012 --> 18:35.382
that week Hector
gave me shingles without you.

18:36.549 --> 18:39.186
If you want Evan to be
as good at relationships

18:39.219 --> 18:40.620
as he is
at everything else,

18:40.653 --> 18:42.189
you need to
let him practice.

do you think

18:51.198 --> 18:53.065
I have to brush
my teeth again?

I'm excited to pick up our mugs
from the kiln.

Yours should be...

19:01.841 --> 19:02.809

Evan, I want to
apologize to you

19:08.715 --> 19:10.350
for being so strict
about dating.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.552
You have nothing
to apologize for, Mommy.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.721
You tried to warn me that
dating would affect my grades,

19:14.754 --> 19:15.855
and you were right.

19:15.888 --> 19:19.792
Well,
that's the thing.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.828
You didn't actually
get an A-minus

19:21.861 --> 19:23.296
on your English essay.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.564
You got an "A."

19:24.597 --> 19:27.400
I went into the school,
and I changed the grade

19:27.434 --> 19:29.135
so you would think
Sicily distracted you

19:29.168 --> 19:30.203
and break up with her.

and --

19:34.407 --> 19:36.543
I heard you
the first time!

19:36.576 --> 19:38.411
How could you
do that to me?

19:38.445 --> 19:39.412
I loved her.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.314
Oh, Evan,
I'm so sorry.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.983
I had no idea
you would be so upset.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.085
I think it's hard for me
to accept

19:46.118 --> 19:47.687
that you're growing up.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.590
You're my youngest,

19:50.623 --> 19:52.425
and I want to shield you
from all the pain

19:52.459 --> 19:53.860
that comes
from being an adult.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.598
But there's a lot of joy
that comes with it, too,

19:58.631 --> 20:00.767
and I never want to
shield you from that.

seems like maybe

20:03.069 --> 20:05.037
you weren't ready
for me to date.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.806
You're so mature.

20:12.144 --> 20:14.581
Aren't you coming?
No, I'm not.

You're my mom,
and you should know

20:29.562 --> 20:31.364
that no matter
how old I get,
