01:38.966 --> 01:42.634
- Good morning, beautiful.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.903
-What time is it?

01:44.905 --> 01:46.805
Eh, 9:00ish.

01:46.807 --> 01:47.940
-Oh.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.141
-Thanks for sleeping over.

01:49.143 --> 01:50.142
-Mm-hmm.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.177
-Feels weird sleeping alone.

01:52.179 --> 01:53.946
Like I'm...Sleeping alone.

01:53.948 --> 01:54.980
You want to move in?

01:54.982 --> 01:56.949
-Ugh, no!

01:56.951 --> 01:59.618
You have got a bad case
of the bed sprawl.

02:01.655 --> 02:04.790
Plus, things are getting
pretty serious with Jason.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.158
-Jason with the hair?

02:06.160 --> 02:07.960
-No, Jared with the hair.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.429
This is Jason with the glasses.

02:10.431 --> 02:13.031
-Didn't you just go out
with him, like, on a first date?

02:13.033 --> 02:14.133
-Uh-huh.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.335
And it was a great first date.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.270
And we've been texting...

02:18.272 --> 02:20.205
All the time!

02:24.144 --> 02:26.011
Anything?

02:26.013 --> 02:29.715
-Just the same three jobs
I'm not qualified for.

02:29.717 --> 02:30.716
This sucks.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.050
-You hated that job.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.952
-Yeah,
but at least I could pay rent.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.155
-Just get a temp job.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.861
Jason!

02:42.863 --> 02:45.497
-Who would ever want to
work a temp job?

02:50.036 --> 02:52.938
-Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.080
-Actually, no bakey.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.382
But there's a goat cheese

03:03.384 --> 03:05.217
and squash frittata
in the fridge.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.486
You can heat it
in the toaster oven at 350

03:07.488 --> 03:09.588
or totally ruin it in the micro.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.924
Amaretto mimosa?
-Oh, no, thanks.

03:11.926 --> 03:14.893
I gotta four-day gig
at mbst&t starting today.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.696
-No way!
They just moved me to mbst&t.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.865
I was totally planning
on having a lame day,

03:19.867 --> 03:21.500
and they've gone
and messed that up.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.035
Did you already
put in your money?

03:23.037 --> 03:25.204
-I put it in the ledger,
but I didn't red-light it.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.345
-What have we got,
like, 75 days left?

03:33.347 --> 03:36.582
-84 if we want to make it there
by Thanksgiving.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.083
-It's a small price to pay
for another

03:38.085 --> 03:41.587
epic Jefferson and Carter
ski adventure!

03:41.589 --> 03:44.756
Whoosh! Whoosh!

03:44.758 --> 03:48.026
We feeling the pink today?

03:48.028 --> 03:49.528
-Yeah, let's give it a try.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.702
-Yeah.
Yeah, I think that works.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.516
-Oh, yeah.
Shake that moneymaker.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.817
All right, guys,

05:18.819 --> 05:20.619
I need you to go through
these boxes here,

05:20.621 --> 05:22.721
make sure we shred anything
older than seven years.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.556
Dates are on the top
of these folders.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.991
Any questions?

05:25.993 --> 05:28.026
-That suit, Ann Taylor?

05:28.028 --> 05:30.195
-Um...It is.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.663
-You really wear it.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.031
-Thank you, Jefferson.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.068
-Mrs. hwang?

05:36.070 --> 05:37.369
-Yes.
-Stephanie.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.071
Cal staff sent me over.

05:39.073 --> 05:42.808
-Okay,
why don't you come with me.

05:43.743 --> 05:45.010
-Ann Taylor?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.078
-I'm telling you, man,

05:46.080 --> 05:48.847
these things are a gold mine.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.549
-Ann Taylor?

05:50.551 --> 05:51.683
-Ross.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.985
-You really wear it.

05:55.154 --> 05:56.855
-We have 2,500 of these

05:56.857 --> 05:58.890
that need to be stuffed
and metered by lunch.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.392
As soon as the other temps
are finished shredding,

06:00.394 --> 06:02.160
they can jump in
and help you out.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.229
-Okay.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.832
-I know, not much time.
-I'll do my best.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.367
-I'd prefer
you just get it done.

06:08.369 --> 06:11.203
-Okay, I'll do that.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.438
-Are you talking back to me?

06:13.440 --> 06:14.506
-No?

06:14.508 --> 06:16.575
- There's a reason

06:16.577 --> 06:19.044
you're a temp worker,
you know that, right?

06:19.046 --> 06:20.946
-Because I got laid off?

06:20.948 --> 06:23.482
-I'm gonna let you in on
a little secret.

06:25.518 --> 06:28.019
They don't lay off
the good workers.

06:29.188 --> 06:30.922
-All right,
I'm gonna go stuff these.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.090
-Please do that.
-I'm going.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.225
-Go.
-Okay.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.226
-Hurry!
-I am.

06:34.228 --> 06:37.629
-Let's go.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.599
Temps.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.268
-Don't take it personally.
Hwang hates girls.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.203
All right, are we doing this?
-And go!

06:45.205 --> 06:46.571
-No, no, no.
-Corner back, corner back!

06:46.573 --> 06:48.874
Oh! Damn it.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.275
-Winner!

06:50.277 --> 06:53.545
-I demand a re-do.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.580
-Is this what you guys
normally do around here?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.716
-Uh...

06:57.718 --> 06:59.951
Sometimes we raid
the office supply closet

06:59.953 --> 07:02.387
and see if we can make a fort
out of anything.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.822
That gets real challenging.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.457
-You enjoy being a temp?

07:05.459 --> 07:07.959
-Temping is just a means
to an end, really.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.327
We're actually skiers.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.663
-Like professional skiers?

07:11.665 --> 07:14.499
-Yeah, kind of.
-Except we don't get paid.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.301
We're going to mount hood
this year.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.804
It's a straga volcano
or strata volcano.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.005
-Strata volcano.
-Yeah.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.573
-Strata volcano.

07:21.575 --> 07:25.444
-So skiing and temping.
Any other life plans?

07:25.446 --> 07:29.314
-I take it you're one
of those live to work people.

07:29.316 --> 07:32.617
-I appreciate the value
of a life's work, yes.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.786
-What's yours, then?

07:34.788 --> 07:39.858
-Oh, well, I...
Went to school for accounting.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.293
-That sounds thrilling.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.995
-Well, what's your life's work,
skiing?

07:43.997 --> 07:45.964
-It's actually not
just about skiing,

07:45.966 --> 07:49.267
it's about, uh, seeing as many
incredible places

07:49.269 --> 07:51.470
and meeting
as many incredible people

07:51.472 --> 07:53.672
and gathering
as many meaningful experiences

07:53.674 --> 07:55.540
before shuffling off
this mortal coil.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.042
You know,
things you can't really do

07:57.044 --> 07:59.878
from a cubicle
or a corner office.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.614
Ever been skiing?

08:02.616 --> 08:04.182
-I was more
of a field hockey girl.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.884
-Me, too.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.453
-I have a boyfriend.
-Was that for me or for her?

08:08.455 --> 08:10.689
-You.
-Oh.

08:10.691 --> 08:13.859
Okay.
Congrats?

08:13.861 --> 08:16.228
-Sorry, I was just
trying to shut this down.

08:16.230 --> 08:17.529
-Shut what down?

08:17.531 --> 08:18.830
-This little banter
we have going on.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.365
-Why?

08:20.367 --> 08:22.634
-Banter usually
implies ulterior motives.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.536
- I'm not hitting on you.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.371
-Good.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.506
-Would you like me to?

08:27.508 --> 08:29.541
-No.

08:29.543 --> 08:32.644
-Seems like maybe you would like
him to hit on you.

08:32.645 --> 08:35.145
Call 'em like I see 'em.

08:38.717 --> 08:40.018
-I'm Jefferson.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.352
-Stephanie.

08:49.428 --> 08:50.996
-So what's your man list?

08:50.998 --> 08:53.732
-My man, oh,
what are you talking about?

08:53.734 --> 08:55.567
-You know, list of qualities

08:55.569 --> 08:57.068
a guy has to posses
in order for you

08:57.070 --> 08:59.905
to open up
your secret sexual side.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.773
-I don't think I have one.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.576
But if I'm trying to waste time
and not do work,

09:04.578 --> 09:08.580
I'd say um...He's gotta be nice,
but not too nice.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.181
-Okay.

09:10.183 --> 09:14.419
-Uh, and he's gotta
like kittens, puppies, and kids.

09:14.421 --> 09:17.422
-This is not quite as secret
or sexual as I was hoping for.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.690
-We're at work.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.225
-Hey, I'm sorry,
can I talk to Stephanie?

09:20.227 --> 09:22.027
She's the cute girl
i was just making out with

09:22.029 --> 09:23.461
in the broom closet.
-Shh!

09:23.463 --> 09:24.930
-Shh!
-Shh!

09:24.932 --> 09:26.231
-Shh, shh!
-Shh!

09:26.233 --> 09:27.866
-I have to say
as a casual observer

09:27.868 --> 09:30.268
of the female species,
you're all highly contradictory.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.904
Because as far as I can tell,
most girls not only have

09:32.906 --> 09:36.775
but, in fact, enjoy many forms
of loud, raunchy, kinky sex.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.109
-Gross.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.478
-See and yet none of you
will ever admit

09:40.480 --> 09:43.615
that you like, want, or have
these various kinds of sex.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.116
What is that?

09:45.118 --> 09:46.651
Is that some kind of agreement
that you all have

09:46.653 --> 09:47.752
where if you don't
talk about it,

09:47.754 --> 09:49.054
it doesn't actually happen?

09:49.056 --> 09:50.388
Like, if a random girl
and a random guy

09:50.390 --> 09:51.823
have sex in a random forest,

09:51.825 --> 09:52.958
yet no one is there
to randomly see it,

09:52.960 --> 09:55.460
can you still call her a slut?

09:55.462 --> 09:59.664
Not that I would ever
call anyone a slut.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.333
Unless you want
to be called a slut.

10:01.335 --> 10:03.635
Even then, I think I would have
my hang-ups with it.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.004
Hello?
You want to get some lunch?

10:06.006 --> 10:08.907
-What are we gonna talk about?

10:08.909 --> 10:11.076
-The weather.

10:12.511 --> 10:15.880
-I like to be tied up.

10:18.851 --> 10:21.519
-Or we can talk about that.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.091
-But we can't.
I'm a girl.

10:27.493 --> 10:30.195
So you ready for lunch?

10:32.198 --> 10:33.598
-Yes.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.781
-Oh, my gosh!

10:49.783 --> 10:51.850
Josh and I would never
come into a store like this.

10:51.852 --> 10:56.054
-Well, maybe that is
why you broke up with him.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.622
-I like it.
-Mm-hmm.

12:11.097 --> 12:13.898
-Um...

12:13.900 --> 12:16.601
I don't really do that.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.103
-The...
-Yeah.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.905
-Oh. Oh, sure.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.540
Good.
-It's just I...

12:22.542 --> 12:23.775
I have lockjaw.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.276
-Ooh!
-Yeah.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.145
-That doesn't sound fun.
-Not at all.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.981
-Well, I should have asked.
That was -- sorry about that.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.483
-Okay.
-Um...

12:36.555 --> 12:39.090
-Oh! That is really gross.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.792
People poop in there.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.694
<i> I</i> poop in there.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.006
Oh!

12:55.008 --> 12:56.541
Ah!

13:07.453 --> 13:09.287
You know we have friends
waiting, right?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.955
-No, I'm sure they're fine.
-Oh!

13:10.957 --> 13:15.260
-Jefferson and I hit
the mountains every single year.

13:15.262 --> 13:18.596
We're going to mount hood
next year -- near Portland.

13:18.598 --> 13:22.300
You know
that's a strata volcano.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.868
-Oh?

13:23.870 --> 13:25.603
-Okay, stop, stop.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.472
You're starting to act like
that vibrator we got.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.642
- Exactly what does that mean?

13:30.644 --> 13:33.211
-It means you know
how it only has the one speed?

13:33.213 --> 13:36.114
Mee! Mee! Mee!
You know?

13:36.116 --> 13:37.782
- Mee!

13:40.653 --> 13:46.124
-Is that Annie Taylor
that you got on?

13:50.062 --> 13:53.665
-Would you like me to be
a little bit more variable?

13:53.667 --> 13:56.301
Maybe...A little bit
more, "rah!"

13:56.303 --> 13:59.337
Or, "errr!" Or,
"dugga-dugga-dugga-dugga."

13:59.339 --> 14:01.005
-Yeah.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.640
-Hey, got you a drink.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.209
Hope you don't mind germs,

14:04.211 --> 14:06.277
'cause I took
a little sip there.

14:10.717 --> 14:11.883
-Oh!
-Shh!

14:11.885 --> 14:14.352
-Ugh! That is really gross.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.254
People work here.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.389
<i> I</i> work here.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.694
-Can I ask your honest opinion.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.195
What do you think
of this jacket?

14:24.197 --> 14:28.099
-No, you may not, and I love it!

14:28.101 --> 14:30.602
-Did we miss anything?

14:30.604 --> 14:35.240
-No, I was just telling Curtis
how awesome his jacket is.

14:35.242 --> 14:38.042
-It's kind
of getting warm in here.

14:38.044 --> 14:42.013
-I'm so confused.
Are you in a relationship?

14:42.015 --> 14:43.948
-We're just trying to keep it
in the moment.

14:43.950 --> 14:46.384
-I don't know what that means.
-I don't, either.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.254
Jefferson says it a lot,
seemed kind of romantic

14:49.256 --> 14:51.456
as I was getting
out of that Josh situation.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.757
-You were getting
out of a something

14:52.759 --> 14:55.360
that started
in junior high situation.

14:55.362 --> 14:58.863
So a toe fungus
would have seemed romantic.

15:02.802 --> 15:05.403
-Oh, well...
I like being in something

15:05.405 --> 15:07.472
that's maybe not so defined.

15:07.474 --> 15:11.309
-Okay, but if a...

15:11.311 --> 15:14.646
Relationship isn't defined
as a relationship,

15:14.648 --> 15:16.147
then is it really
a relationship,

15:16.149 --> 15:17.815
because it seems like half

15:17.817 --> 15:19.984
of what makes a relationship
a relationship

15:19.986 --> 15:23.121
is being able
to call it a relationship.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.322
Am I right?
-Whatever.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.591
You know, whatever.
I'm happy.

15:26.593 --> 15:30.828
And the sex
is fucking animal style.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.297
-I don't know.

15:32.299 --> 15:35.066
You always struck me
as the person

15:35.068 --> 15:37.435
who needed an update
on her Facebook status

15:37.437 --> 15:39.437
in order to go
fucking animal style.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.606
-That was the old Steph.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.341
-I want ice cream.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.910
Do you want ice cream?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.816
I want ice cream.
-Yeah.

16:22.181 --> 16:24.549
-Guess who sent me
a relationship request.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.051
-Oh, things are getting serious.

16:27.053 --> 16:28.486
What are you gonna do?

16:28.488 --> 16:30.521
-I don't know.
I'm gonna...

16:30.523 --> 16:32.156
Ignore her for now
and then just hope

16:32.158 --> 16:33.658
that she forgets she sent it.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.293
-Yeah, that's cool.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.795
I have an uncle who sends me
candy crush requests,

16:37.797 --> 16:39.697
and I just ignore them.

16:39.699 --> 16:43.901
I'm never gonna play
that game, okay?

16:43.903 --> 16:46.571
-Oops.
Dropped some shit there.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.707
-Thanks.

16:50.542 --> 16:51.909
Don't worry about it.

16:51.911 --> 16:54.679
-Oh! Mmm!

16:54.681 --> 16:58.583
-In order, nape of the neck,
eyes, and teeth.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.052
-Nape of the neck?
Dude, you're a liar.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.353
-I am not a liar.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.855
-That's the kind of list
a guy makes

17:03.857 --> 17:04.989
when he's embarrassed
to say the first thing

17:04.991 --> 17:06.089
he looks for are tits.

17:06.092 --> 17:07.191
-Tits?

17:07.193 --> 17:08.593
-Yes, every guy looks for tits.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.161
-No, you --
you can't help seeing them,

17:10.163 --> 17:11.662
they're right in front of you.

17:11.664 --> 17:15.199
What I look for
is a nice nape of the neck.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.934
-I guess you have a point.

17:16.935 --> 17:19.436
-Well, what's the first thing
that you look for?

17:19.439 --> 17:21.406
-Tits.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.976
-Hey, guys.

17:28.914 --> 17:30.448
-Oh!

17:30.450 --> 17:32.450
-Nice nape.

17:35.587 --> 17:37.922
-Who do you think was the genius
who first took a popsicle stick,

17:37.924 --> 17:40.258
jammed it in a hot dog,
and then dipped it in a fryer?

17:40.260 --> 17:43.628
-I notice you haven't accepted
my relationship status change.

17:46.465 --> 17:48.266
-What?

17:48.268 --> 17:50.568
-Yeah, I sent it to you,
like, two or three weeks ago.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.071
It's not that big a deal,
i just figured

17:53.073 --> 17:56.474
maybe it's time our status
reflected our relationship.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.809
I did notice that you had time

17:57.811 --> 18:01.312
to post those hilarious
workplace memes.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.481
Classic.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.283
-Well...

18:05.285 --> 18:07.452
Remember how, um...

18:07.454 --> 18:10.321
Refreshing we thought
this thing is that we have?

18:10.323 --> 18:13.624
-What is this thing
that we have?

18:13.626 --> 18:15.793
-This?
-This.

18:15.795 --> 18:18.729
Us, you and me -- this.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.698
What is it?

18:22.568 --> 18:24.302
-Complicated.

18:24.304 --> 18:27.572
-Then how about it's complicated
as a status?

18:27.574 --> 18:30.475
Just some indication
that we're together.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.910
-Steph, it's only been,
like, a month.

18:34.346 --> 18:37.081
-It's been almost three.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.583
-Really?

18:38.585 --> 18:39.917
-Do you really think
I'd be doing the things

18:39.919 --> 18:42.587
we've been doing
with some random guy?

18:44.324 --> 18:47.158
-We haven't even
been on a real date yet.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.793
-Date?!

18:48.795 --> 18:50.461
You don't even buy me drinks.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.864
-Yeah, 'cause
that would make it a real date.

18:52.866 --> 18:56.367
-Oh. Wow.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.935
I --

18:57.937 --> 19:00.471
are you embarrassed
by me or something?

19:00.473 --> 19:01.706
-No!

19:01.708 --> 19:03.774
No, Steph, you are...

19:03.776 --> 19:06.711
Way one of the coolest, sexiest,
funniest chicks

19:06.713 --> 19:08.346
in the world, probably.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.614
-Then what the fuck?!

19:09.616 --> 19:11.482
-The fuck is...

19:11.484 --> 19:13.317
I don't know, why can't people
just be happy

19:13.319 --> 19:14.886
with the way things are?

19:14.888 --> 19:16.787
You know, why can't people
just live in the now?

19:16.789 --> 19:18.389
Why does everybody have to label
and compartmentalize

19:18.391 --> 19:21.058
everything in their lives?
-Because, Jefferson,

19:21.060 --> 19:22.460
that's how we make
an informed decision

19:22.462 --> 19:23.828
on what we keep
and what we throw out.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.630
-Like Josh?

19:27.065 --> 19:30.868
-Yes. Exactly like Josh.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.037
And whoever first decided
to jam a popsicle stick

19:33.039 --> 19:34.739
into a hot dog was an asshole!

19:34.741 --> 19:36.974
This is disgusting!

19:39.012 --> 19:41.245
-Stephanie!

19:41.247 --> 19:43.181
Steph!

19:43.183 --> 19:46.484
Estephania!

19:46.486 --> 19:48.886
Hey, that's my corn dog!

19:48.888 --> 19:51.355
That's my corn dog!

19:51.357 --> 19:52.523
You know what,
i don't want to be tagged

19:52.525 --> 19:53.824
in anyone's photos, either.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.026
It's a creepy invasion
of privacy.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.494
-I agree.
-This sucks, man.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.829
It's like I get punished
for knowing what I want.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.098
-What do you want?

20:02.768 --> 20:04.402
Holy crap!

20:04.404 --> 20:07.672
That's Allison segal
from high school.

20:12.744 --> 20:14.579
-Look at that,
it's Allison segal.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.714
-I want out with her once --
junior year.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.082
-You did not go out
with Allison segal.

20:18.084 --> 20:19.584
You never went out with anybody.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.285
And Todd Parker went out
with Allison segal.

20:21.287 --> 20:22.753
-No, that was me.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.422
-Well, Todd Parker
went out with her, too.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.923
Then again, he crushed,
like, every girl in high school.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.525
I wonder what he's up to?

20:27.527 --> 20:29.460
-He's probably in jail.

20:29.462 --> 20:32.096
-Or witness protection.
We should call him.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.731
Will and Nicholas, too.
Those were good guys.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.600
-She didn't recognize us.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.268
-Or she did.

20:37.270 --> 20:40.538
-She looks exactly the same,
only more professional,

20:40.540 --> 20:44.475
like a businesswoman,
not a prostitute.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.044
I wonder if she's single.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.813
-No matter what I do,
I'm gonna befoul this thing

20:48.815 --> 20:50.414
with Stephanie.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.817
-Yeah.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.252
-What?

20:54.254 --> 20:57.455
-She's probably single.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.156
-Oh.

20:59.158 --> 21:00.958
Yeah.

21:28.487 --> 21:32.056
Where you at today?

21:46.204 --> 21:49.573
-Hell.

21:55.213 --> 21:56.947
-Me, too.

21:56.949 --> 22:00.851
I'm back working
with the hwang again.

22:05.290 --> 22:08.359
-Oh. My favorite.

22:08.361 --> 22:11.696
Say hi for me.

22:13.499 --> 22:14.965
-I thought about it,

22:14.967 --> 22:17.568
and maybe we can go out
on a real date,

22:17.570 --> 22:20.705
just so you can see
how much I suck at dating

22:20.707 --> 22:24.075
and why I shouldn't do it.

22:27.045 --> 22:31.515
-Are you asking me out
on a date?

22:31.517 --> 22:38.589
-For strictly scienti--
scientific purposes only.

22:47.866 --> 22:54.739
-I'd love to be experimented on.

23:08.554 --> 23:11.355
-Are you bored?

23:11.357 --> 23:13.524
-What? No, no.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.960
-Oh, great. I'm boring you.
I'm boring.

23:15.962 --> 23:18.429
-Stop it, you're not boring.
-I actually know that I am.

23:18.431 --> 23:19.764
It's okay, just go ahead
and say it,

23:19.766 --> 23:22.566
come out and tell me.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.435
-What you're sensing right now
is not boredom,

23:24.437 --> 23:25.870
it's just
like when I get hungry,

23:25.872 --> 23:27.872
I just get, you know,
one-track minded

23:27.874 --> 23:29.540
and, you know,
i just get tunnel vision.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.108
It's like boom -- food.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.443
Just...

23:32.445 --> 23:34.078
-Boom, food.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.946
-Tunnel vision.

23:37.816 --> 23:40.217
-Right.

23:54.633 --> 23:56.667
-Your hair looks really nice.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.769
Did you do something different?

23:58.771 --> 24:00.771
-Kind of.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.240
Thanks for noticing.

24:03.242 --> 24:06.277
-It looks really nice.

24:06.279 --> 24:09.246
-I'm glad you like it.

24:09.248 --> 24:11.682
- Oh.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.861
Dave Matthews?

24:23.863 --> 24:25.429
-No, way worse than that.

24:25.431 --> 24:26.997
-Jack Johnson,
'cause he's about as bad

24:26.999 --> 24:30.134
as anybody I can think of.
-Why do you want to know?

24:30.136 --> 24:32.269
-Because I think you can tell
a lot about somebody

24:32.271 --> 24:34.205
from their most embarrassing
music purchase.

24:34.207 --> 24:36.106
Dashboard confessional.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.975
-I like dashboard confessional.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.610
-Oh, god!
-I like them!

24:40.646 --> 24:41.879
-I like dashboard.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.447
-Oh, man, that --

24:43.449 --> 24:45.282
you really do have
questionable taste in music.

24:45.284 --> 24:47.885
Really questionable.
Jason mraz.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.854
-Not gonna tell you.
-Come on, I told you mine.

24:49.856 --> 24:53.357
-Oh, you told me you downloaded
a bright eyes album one time.

24:53.359 --> 24:55.025
How embarrassing is that?
-Super embarrassing.

24:55.027 --> 24:59.230
-I own all of his albums
plus an ep.

24:59.232 --> 25:00.998
-How can you say he won?!

25:01.000 --> 25:02.666
Look, he's -- he's sulking back
into the ocean,

25:02.668 --> 25:04.001
a defeated beast.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.904
-She's returning home.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.739
-Godzilla's not a woman!

25:08.741 --> 25:13.878
-Um, she had a kid
in "Godzilla's revenge," hello!

25:13.880 --> 25:15.479
-We're gonna have to have
a serious talk,

25:15.481 --> 25:17.548
because that doesn't
qualify as a movie.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.717
-Okay, regardless of
how you feel about it,

25:19.719 --> 25:21.418
<i> she</i> would still be the winner.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.254
-Okay.

25:23.256 --> 25:25.556
Seriously, I just want you
to think about this, okay?

25:25.558 --> 25:27.424
Who would win in a fight --

25:27.426 --> 25:31.228
a giant, pre-historic dinosaur
with clear back problems

25:31.230 --> 25:34.999
or Kong,
the eighth wonder of the world?

25:35.001 --> 25:37.234
-Radioactive mutant lizard,
no question.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.603
-Ugh, you!
You're a lost cause.

25:39.605 --> 25:40.871
You're beautiful,

25:40.873 --> 25:42.373
but god damn it,
you're a lost cause.

26:04.095 --> 26:06.730
I had
a really good time tonight.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.433
- Yeah, me, too.

26:13.438 --> 26:14.805
I better go, though.

26:14.807 --> 26:17.875
-That would probably be best.

26:17.877 --> 26:20.945
-Yeah. Yeah.

26:20.947 --> 26:24.715
Otherwise, it's like there's
this giant elephant in the room

26:24.717 --> 26:28.118
that I want to...

26:31.323 --> 26:33.157
...fuck.

26:39.464 --> 26:42.132
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Go turn off the TV.

27:53.739 --> 27:56.006
That was like...

27:56.008 --> 28:00.878
Some of the most normal sex
we've ever had.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.547
-Is that a bad thing?

28:03.549 --> 28:06.917
-No.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.858
Creed.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.493
-You brought creed.

28:16.495 --> 28:18.429
Wow. That is...

28:18.431 --> 28:20.497
So much worse
than I could have thought.

28:20.499 --> 28:23.734
-I know! I know.

28:35.014 --> 28:37.614
You crack me up.

28:40.919 --> 28:43.353
-So this is how
it's gonna be, huh?

28:43.355 --> 28:44.922
Every morning when I wake up,

28:44.924 --> 28:47.224
you're gonna be here
taking away my opportunities

28:47.226 --> 28:49.126
to walk around naked.

28:49.128 --> 28:50.894
It's 4:00 in the afternoon.

28:50.896 --> 28:53.964
-I'm a night owl.
Hoot! Hoot!

28:53.966 --> 28:56.600
-Well, if you want to walk
around naked, be my guest.

28:56.602 --> 28:59.036
-I'm gonna hold you to that.
Where's Jefferson?

28:59.038 --> 29:00.437
-Out getting wine and cheese.

29:00.439 --> 29:01.772
We're going to see
a movie tonight

29:01.774 --> 29:03.607
at the Hollywood cemetery.

29:03.609 --> 29:07.611
-Ah, you're running
the bases backwards.

29:07.613 --> 29:09.279
-Running the bases backwards?

29:09.281 --> 29:10.748
-Means you start with sex

29:10.750 --> 29:13.250
and then you do
all that couply stuff.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.119
-Yeah, I guess.

29:15.121 --> 29:17.454
-Now, the pancakes
with orange zest.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.790
-Curtis?

29:19.792 --> 29:21.725
-Dude!

29:21.727 --> 29:23.560
-Oh, my god,
is that a real newspaper?

29:23.562 --> 29:26.730
-She's dead.

29:26.732 --> 29:28.966
-Allison segal? How?

29:28.968 --> 29:30.434
-Her heart exploded.

29:30.436 --> 29:33.737
-Gross!

29:38.243 --> 29:43.747
Should we say a prayer or...
Something?

29:43.749 --> 29:45.682
-I'm gonna be honest,
i feel little weird

29:45.684 --> 29:48.685
saying a prayer
over a pair of used panties.

29:48.687 --> 29:50.320
-What?

29:50.322 --> 29:54.024
I have a pair from every girl
I've been with.

29:54.026 --> 29:56.693
-Yeah, that's a little...
That's just creepy.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.328
Okay, Steph, back me up on this.
This is a little --

29:58.330 --> 30:00.164
-oh, actually,
i can't say anything. I --

30:00.166 --> 30:03.667
I do have a pair from
all the girls I've been with.

30:03.669 --> 30:06.837
-If only we had stopped her
to say hi.

30:06.839 --> 30:11.275
She could have been the one
to find a cure to cancer.

30:11.277 --> 30:12.676
-Was she that smart?

30:12.678 --> 30:15.512
-Or...Stumbled upon it.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.614
-I never knew Allison very well,

30:17.616 --> 30:19.449
but in high school,

30:19.451 --> 30:21.885
I was always a big fan
of her perky boobs --

30:21.887 --> 30:23.554
-don't say that,
you piece of shit!

30:23.556 --> 30:25.155
-Oh, Curtis, cool out!

30:25.157 --> 30:27.024
Cool out, man.

30:27.026 --> 30:30.661
-Jesus, Curtis, calm down.

30:30.663 --> 30:32.229
Not a...

30:32.231 --> 30:35.032
I'm sorry, I never knew you felt
that strongly about her.

30:35.034 --> 30:38.535
-She was my first.

30:38.537 --> 30:42.239
-I thought Janet moler
was your first.

30:45.711 --> 30:47.611
Orally.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.418
-Sometimes I don't get Curtis
at all.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.353
-Haven't you ever been
madly in love?

30:56.355 --> 30:57.688
-Please,
he was not madly in love.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.156
I didn't even
know they were going out.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.991
-And what about you?

31:00.993 --> 31:03.026
- I thought I was, once.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.261
Turned out to be the flu.

31:04.263 --> 31:07.998
-I'm serious.
-I'm serious, too.

31:08.833 --> 31:11.702
Just once,
then I lost all self-respect.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.503
-What happened?

31:13.505 --> 31:16.039
-Ugh, I don't know.
It was like a year ago.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.875
We were going out for a while,
and then suddenly she decided

31:17.877 --> 31:19.776
she needed to find herself.

31:19.778 --> 31:23.347
Apparently, she'd been hiding
inside another man's penis.

31:23.349 --> 31:24.915
-That's a good place to hide.

31:24.917 --> 31:26.917
Bet you didn't think
to look there.

31:26.919 --> 31:28.418
-Are you folks ready to order?

31:28.420 --> 31:30.754
-Sure.
Go ahead.

31:30.756 --> 31:34.258
-Uh...
The, um, the chicken special.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.893
How does that come?

31:35.895 --> 31:37.361
-Baked, broiled, barbecue,
stuffed, flame-broiled,

31:37.363 --> 31:39.363
peppered, on in a nice pot pie.

31:39.365 --> 31:40.898
-Um...

31:40.900 --> 31:43.267
The -- the broi--
broiled chicken special.

31:43.269 --> 31:45.235
-Me, too.
-How would you like the potato?

31:45.237 --> 31:47.571
-Baked.
-What are the other options?

31:47.573 --> 31:48.772
-Baked, whipped,
scalloped, au gratin,

31:48.774 --> 31:50.474
country-fried, French fries.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.609
-Can we possibly substitute that
with like a fruit compote?

31:52.611 --> 31:54.278
-Just get whipped.
Everyone likes whipped.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.746
-I do like whipped.
I'll get whipped.

31:55.748 --> 31:56.947
-Soup or salad?
-Salad.

31:56.949 --> 31:58.415
-Sure.
-Two salads.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.083
-Ranch, Russian,
thousand island, blue cheese,

32:00.085 --> 32:02.085
ranch peppercorn, ranch
vinaigrette, house Italian?

32:02.087 --> 32:03.987
-Do you have roquefort, or is
that the same as blue cheese?

32:03.989 --> 32:05.322
-If they had roquefort,
she'd say roquefort.

32:05.324 --> 32:06.990
-Unless they were
the same thing.

32:06.992 --> 32:09.259
-We have blue cheese.
-House Italian for me, please.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.128
-Can I switch that to the soup?
-Veggie, beef barley,

32:11.130 --> 32:12.996
chicken noodle, cream of celery,
or matzo ball.

32:12.998 --> 32:14.965
-Just go with the salad,
house dressing.

32:14.967 --> 32:17.134
-Sure, yeah. Does the special
come with bread?

32:17.136 --> 32:18.802
-Yes, white, wheat,
rye, marble rye, pumpernickel,

32:18.804 --> 32:20.804
sour dough, kaiser roll,
or bread stick.

32:20.806 --> 32:22.472
-Can we just get a variety
in a basket?

32:22.474 --> 32:23.840
-Two specials, broiled,

32:23.842 --> 32:25.342
potatoes --
one baked, one whipped --

32:25.344 --> 32:27.611
two salads, house dressing,
basket of bread.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.912
Anything to drink?

32:28.914 --> 32:30.514
-Two cokes.
-I'll be up all night.

32:30.516 --> 32:31.915
-Coke, diet coke,
sprite, root beer, iced tea,

32:31.917 --> 32:33.917
lemonade, o.J., coffee,
tea, or milk?

32:33.919 --> 32:36.987
-One coke, one...
-Sprite?

32:39.490 --> 32:41.325
You're very decisive.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.827
-Maybe that's your problem,
you need to be more decisive.

32:43.829 --> 32:46.430
-Well, I have way
more problems than that.

32:46.432 --> 32:47.464
I think.

32:52.437 --> 32:54.104
-I'm sorry, you guys.

32:54.106 --> 32:57.407
We're all out of chicken.

33:33.078 --> 33:34.811
-Hey.
-Hey, how's it going?

33:34.813 --> 33:36.079
Am I interrupting?

33:36.081 --> 33:37.881
-Not at all.

33:37.883 --> 33:40.817
I was just warming up,
loosen out all those bugs.

33:40.819 --> 33:43.487
-Mm-hmm.
What for?

33:43.489 --> 33:45.822
-Well, after seeing
Allison right before she died,

33:45.824 --> 33:48.725
I realized she saw me
for who I was.

33:48.727 --> 33:51.561
She saw that I had the soul
of an artist.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.163
-Wait, what?
What does that mean?

33:53.165 --> 33:56.066
- I'm gonna be a dancer.

33:56.068 --> 33:58.568
-Like as a job,
you're gonna do it as a job?

33:58.570 --> 34:00.904
-It's not commerce
of the wallet,

34:00.906 --> 34:03.340
it's commerce of the spirit.

34:03.342 --> 34:05.709
We only live once.

34:05.711 --> 34:09.212
I need to find a way
to express myself.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.547
-Through dance?

34:10.549 --> 34:13.583
-Yes.

34:13.585 --> 34:15.819
How do you express yourself?

34:17.422 --> 34:20.623
-Um, ah, I'm not sure I do.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.692
-That's your problem.

34:22.694 --> 34:25.695
-Why does everybody think
i have a problem lately?

34:25.697 --> 34:28.065
I'm actually very happy
with my life.

34:28.067 --> 34:30.434
-That's your problem, too.

34:38.076 --> 34:41.043
Plans and projects

35:06.138 --> 35:08.405
-no fucking way!
Todd Parker!

35:08.407 --> 35:10.740
-Jeffy! Wow!
Hey, how are you, man?

35:10.742 --> 35:12.342
-Oh, where have you been, man?

35:12.344 --> 35:14.077
Curtis and I were just taking
bets on whether you were

35:14.079 --> 35:17.314
in prison or witness protection.
-Oh, no, no, no.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.583
-Still cruising the bitches
and slapping the hos?

35:19.585 --> 35:21.084
-Eh, not so much.

35:21.086 --> 35:22.986
-They must have named an std
after you now.

35:22.988 --> 35:24.321
I swear, you had 30
different strands of chlamydia

35:24.323 --> 35:25.856
that one summer.

35:25.858 --> 35:27.324
Speaking of bitches you crushed,

35:27.326 --> 35:28.692
did you hear
about Allison segal?

35:28.694 --> 35:30.427
-Yeah, it's sad.
-Fucking terrible.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.929
-By the way, this is my wife.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.030
-Oh.

35:34.032 --> 35:35.832
-And my little girl, Claudia.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.267
-Your...

35:37.269 --> 35:38.702
Your little...

35:38.704 --> 35:40.637
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you. Hi.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.939
- This is Jeffy.

35:42.941 --> 35:45.008
We were...Pals.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.209
-Yeah.
-At school.

35:46.211 --> 35:47.777
-Yeah, yeah.

35:47.779 --> 35:51.114
Wow! Look at --
Todd Parker and fam.

35:51.116 --> 35:52.482
This is just --
you know what?

35:52.484 --> 35:54.284
Can I get a picture of you guys?
This --

35:54.286 --> 35:55.952
Curtis is gonna
laugh his ass off.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.954
Oh, wow!

35:57.956 --> 36:00.457
Uh, a little closer.
A little closer.

36:00.459 --> 36:04.127
Yeah. That's all right.
I'll widen out. Nice.

36:04.129 --> 36:06.329
Oh, you would not believe
the trouble we used to get into.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.698
This guy.
-Yeah, she's heard the stories.

36:08.700 --> 36:11.067
-Uh, Claudia's getting
a little grumpy here.

36:11.069 --> 36:13.136
I'm gonna take her to the car.

36:13.138 --> 36:14.804
It was nice to meet you, Jeffy.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.374
-Nice to meet you.
-See you in a bit.

36:17.376 --> 36:19.309
I'll be right out.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.646
-Bye, Claudia.

36:23.481 --> 36:24.681
-Shit, man,
how many fucking times

36:24.683 --> 36:26.082
did I tell you to wrap it up?

36:26.084 --> 36:27.350
You're lucky it was a baby
and not aids.

36:28.720 --> 36:32.923
Yeah, well, I...
I kind of wanted this one.

36:32.925 --> 36:34.491
But, anyway, what's going on
with you, man?

36:34.493 --> 36:36.059
You working, what are you doing?

36:36.061 --> 36:38.161
-Oh, yeah, yeah! You know,
working -- oops, shit!

36:38.163 --> 36:39.663
Working on not working.

36:39.665 --> 36:42.165
Working on getting
to a mountain each season.

36:42.167 --> 36:44.201
Hey, so, you know,
i was gonna go get a drink.

36:44.203 --> 36:45.535
You should come out with.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.337
-Oh...No, I can't.

36:47.339 --> 36:50.674
I, uh, I gotta get Claudia down.
It's past her bedtime.

36:50.676 --> 36:52.409
-Bedtime? It's like --

36:52.411 --> 36:54.511
-naptime, you know.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.414
-Not really.
-Babies take naps.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.516
-Yeah.
Well, maybe another time then.

36:59.518 --> 37:00.850
We'll go out for a...

37:00.852 --> 37:02.385
You know,
Curtis would love to see you.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.554
Speaking of, do you ever
see will or Nicholas or --

37:04.556 --> 37:07.057
-oh, yeah, yeah.
They're -- they're both married.

37:07.059 --> 37:09.159
Will's working on kid
number two.

37:10.361 --> 37:12.796
- What?!
-Yeah, I know.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.231
-What?! Married?!
-Yeah.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.633
-Kids? What --
what happened to you guys?

37:16.635 --> 37:19.102
You all get, like, abducted
by aliens or something?

37:19.104 --> 37:22.973
-Oh, no, we just kind
of grew up, you know.

37:22.975 --> 37:24.241
You know what?

37:24.243 --> 37:26.376
Let me get a picture
of you, too.

37:26.378 --> 37:29.813
The guys are not gonna believe
how much you have <i> not</i> changed.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.715
-Yeah. How about this?

37:31.717 --> 37:33.250
Sun's out, guns out.
Do this.

37:33.252 --> 37:35.485
-Oh, yeah, yeah!
Classic Chucky.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.886
Oh, so stupid.
-It's like old times.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.755
You get it?!
-That's awesome!

37:38.757 --> 37:40.390
Oh, man.

37:40.392 --> 37:42.959
Well, I gotta get out of here,
but good to see you.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.894
-Yeah, totally.
-Say hi to Curtis.

37:44.896 --> 37:47.797
Tell him I remember
he owes me 40 bucks.

37:47.799 --> 37:49.432
-Dude, he's gonna flip.
-Yeah.

37:49.434 --> 37:51.134
All right, see ya.
-Oh, hey, um...

37:51.136 --> 37:55.472
Speaking of, do you think
i could borrow, like, 20 bucks?

37:58.509 --> 38:00.910
-30 different strands
of chlamydia?

38:00.912 --> 38:02.345
-He was exaggerating.

38:02.347 --> 38:04.247
It was one summer, I got it,
like, twice.

38:04.249 --> 38:06.983
It's not a big deal.
It was like 10 years ago.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.752
-I don't want you hanging out
with him.

38:08.754 --> 38:11.321
-Okay, well, you don't have
to worry about it.

38:43.021 --> 38:46.156
-Hello.
-Hey.

38:46.158 --> 38:48.625
-Unironic knuckle bump.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.527
-What are we moronically
knuckle-bumping to?

38:50.529 --> 38:53.229
-Unironically knuckle-bumping
to the somebody here

38:53.231 --> 38:55.965
who got a real job today.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.534
-What?!
-Yeah.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.069
It's only
an entry-level position,

38:59.071 --> 39:02.739
but it's full-time
with benefits and a key fob!

39:02.741 --> 39:06.543
-I didn't even know
that you were looking or...

39:06.545 --> 39:08.545
Full-time, huh?
-Yeah!

39:08.547 --> 39:10.547
Yeah, I just put it out
into the universe,

39:10.549 --> 39:12.382
then I ran into
this old friend of mine.

39:12.384 --> 39:14.984
Her company was looking,
and the next thing you know...

39:14.986 --> 39:17.721
Key fob!
-Sweet.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.189
Soon you'll be able
to afford some atvs

39:19.191 --> 39:20.824
and jet skis you'll never use.

39:20.826 --> 39:24.027
-What are you talking about?

39:24.029 --> 39:25.395
-I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

39:25.397 --> 39:28.064
This is exciting.
Come here. Come here.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.232
Mmm!

39:29.234 --> 39:31.568
-Mwah!

39:31.570 --> 39:34.137
Oh.

39:38.242 --> 39:40.243
You don't want to be a temp
for the rest of your life,

39:40.245 --> 39:42.779
do you?

39:44.216 --> 39:46.416
-What?

39:46.717 --> 39:48.718
-Yeah.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.086
Oh.

39:50.088 --> 39:53.123
Oh, what's her name?

39:53.125 --> 39:54.858
-Dad.
-Oh, sounds hot.

39:54.860 --> 39:59.195
-I need to go
get something from him.

39:59.197 --> 40:01.898
-Does this mean
i get to meet your dad?

40:01.900 --> 40:03.967
-No.

40:18.650 --> 40:21.284
-There's my boy!
How are the slopes?!

40:21.286 --> 40:23.319
-Gonna find out.

40:23.321 --> 40:24.821
-Come aboard, come aboard.

40:26.658 --> 40:27.824
-Oh.
-Tricky.

40:27.826 --> 40:30.093
-Oh.
-Mind if I vape?

40:30.095 --> 40:35.298
I got a sweet little
personal-use grow-op topside.

40:35.300 --> 40:38.468
For my migraines
and anxieties -- totally legal.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.303
But...

40:40.305 --> 40:43.573
I lace it with a hint of opium.
Not as legal.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.575
Dad, it's 10:30 in the morning.

40:45.577 --> 40:50.613
-Well, what is you kids say,
it's 4:20 somewhere.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.982
-Oh, no. Thank you.

41:08.265 --> 41:10.633
-Anyway.

41:10.635 --> 41:11.801
-Oh.

41:11.803 --> 41:14.838
Uh, it's from you grandma.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.372
And then...

41:16.374 --> 41:19.008
I had to borrow,
like, 40 bucks out of there

41:19.010 --> 41:22.479
to cover my health insurance.

41:22.481 --> 41:25.748
-It's -- it's fine.

41:32.456 --> 41:34.524
Dad?

41:34.526 --> 41:36.192
Dad?
-Oh, my god, man.

41:36.194 --> 41:39.195
Where's my manners.
Let me give you the grand tour.

41:39.197 --> 41:42.065
Um...

41:42.067 --> 41:43.833
Uh, there's the kitchenette,

41:43.835 --> 41:46.803
um...The microwave oven,

41:46.805 --> 41:49.973
toaster oven, range top.

41:49.975 --> 41:53.042
And here's my bedroom.

41:53.044 --> 41:56.980
Motion of the ocean,
it's like sleeping in the womb.

41:56.982 --> 42:00.583
And then through the kitchenette
is the freedom room.

42:00.585 --> 42:02.352
That's for...Open debate

42:02.354 --> 42:05.388
and discourse
and just vegging out.

42:05.390 --> 42:10.193
Plus, I got directv,
so I watch "whale wars."

42:10.195 --> 42:14.898
-Well, it is
a very lovely home...Boat.

42:14.900 --> 42:18.568
-When Jeffy's mom left,
my whole perspective changed.

42:18.570 --> 42:20.003
And I just looked around,

42:20.005 --> 42:21.771
and I thought,
"do these advanced degrees

42:21.773 --> 42:23.706
hanging on the wall
mean anything?

42:23.708 --> 42:28.177
Does Volvo's safety record
mean anything?"

42:28.179 --> 42:29.879
I'm 15 years into
a 30-year mortgage

42:29.881 --> 42:32.582
and who cares?!

42:32.584 --> 42:35.051
It's prison.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.353
And little Jeffy sprouted
his little wings,

42:37.355 --> 42:39.022
flew the Coop, and that was it.

42:39.024 --> 42:40.890
I just...

42:40.892 --> 42:43.092
Didn't need to own anything,
didn't need to be anywhere,

42:43.094 --> 42:45.028
so I had a friend,
he had a boat,

42:45.030 --> 42:47.196
and I'm living the dream
for $375 a month,

42:47.198 --> 42:49.566
plus I gotta scrape
the barnacles off.

42:49.568 --> 42:51.901
-Okay, we gotta go, dad.
-Yeah, me, too.

42:51.903 --> 42:54.571
Don't be a stranger, okay,
unless that's your thing.

42:54.573 --> 42:55.872
All right, how about a hug.

42:55.874 --> 42:57.073
-Oh.
-Mm!

42:57.075 --> 42:58.641
-So nice to meet you.

42:58.643 --> 43:01.210
-Oh, my god. That feels good!

43:01.212 --> 43:03.146
Dang. Seriously.

43:03.148 --> 43:05.214
What do you gotta do
to score a fox like you?

43:05.216 --> 43:07.283
-Easy.

43:12.790 --> 43:14.223
-By left,
he meant left this earth.

43:14.225 --> 43:15.592
My mother's dead.

43:19.730 --> 43:21.264
-I'm sorry.

43:21.266 --> 43:23.533
-It was a long time ago.

43:25.302 --> 43:26.636
Should have just told you
earlier.

43:26.638 --> 43:29.272
I don't know why I didn't.

43:29.274 --> 43:32.241
-It's okay.

43:32.243 --> 43:34.243
-Yeah, thank god I only have
to see him once a month.

43:37.449 --> 43:38.982
You know...
-Yes.

43:38.984 --> 43:41.317
-No. Mnh-mnh.

43:50.362 --> 43:54.764
-Are you sure
he can't hear us?

43:54.766 --> 43:56.099
-Oh, no,
he can definitely hear us,

43:56.101 --> 43:59.435
I just told him not to listen.

44:00.804 --> 44:04.474
-Oh, no, I -- no, no.
I can't do this.

44:04.476 --> 44:06.142
-What do you mean you can't
do this? Yes, you can.

44:06.144 --> 44:07.677
-I can't do this.
-Yes, you can totally do this.

44:07.679 --> 44:09.278
You can absolutely --
-no.

44:09.280 --> 44:11.214
-Oh, come on. You can do it
in the bathroom of a bar

44:11.216 --> 44:14.951
or in the broom closet
of an office or in the car,

44:14.953 --> 44:17.687
but you can't do it
with little Curtis around.

44:17.689 --> 44:19.122
-No, no, listen -- listen.

44:19.124 --> 44:20.957
-Mm-hmm.
-They were strangers.

44:20.959 --> 44:24.627
I know Curtis,
i have to see him again.

44:24.629 --> 44:26.129
-Want to go to your place?

44:26.131 --> 44:28.364
-I would,
but it's after midnight

44:28.366 --> 44:29.465
and I have to work tomorrow.

44:29.467 --> 44:31.134
-Yeah, so?

44:31.136 --> 44:32.402
-Hey, hey, listen.

44:32.404 --> 44:34.537
How about I just a rain check

44:34.539 --> 44:37.807
for when Curtis is out of town
or something.

44:37.809 --> 44:39.475
-Fine, blue-ball me.

44:39.477 --> 44:41.144
-Ew.
Never, ever say that again.

44:41.146 --> 44:43.780
-Oh, don't ever do it again.

44:45.582 --> 44:47.817
-Oh, by the way,
what are you doing on Saturday?

44:47.819 --> 44:49.686
-Nothing, I don't think.
-Good.

44:49.688 --> 44:52.255
'Cause I plus-oned you to
this girl, Miranda's, wedding.

44:52.257 --> 44:53.856
I just started working with her,

44:53.858 --> 44:55.525
so it's kind of weird
that I even got an invite,

44:55.527 --> 44:57.060
but not surprising seeing
as though

44:57.062 --> 44:58.828
I get invited to everybody's
wedding,

44:58.830 --> 45:01.864
this being the sixth
of the year.

45:01.866 --> 45:03.666
-You plus-oned me to a --
to a wedding?

45:03.668 --> 45:06.836
-Yeah, free food, an open bar,
i figured you wouldn't mind.

45:06.838 --> 45:08.438
-You can't just plus-one
somebody to a wedding

45:08.440 --> 45:10.840
without asking
if they're available first.

45:10.842 --> 45:13.342
-I'm sorry, I didn't think
it would be a thing.

45:13.344 --> 45:15.778
-To -- to a wedding?
To a work person's wedding,

45:15.780 --> 45:17.447
and you think
i want to go hang out

45:17.449 --> 45:19.515
with a bunch of stiffs
i have nothing in common with?

45:19.517 --> 45:22.185
-Okay, first of all, they're not
stiffs, they're my friends.

45:22.187 --> 45:24.053
-Oh, and what do you do,
friend of Stephanie's?

45:24.055 --> 45:27.056
Oh, I fill in for you assholes
for about 1/10 of your salary

45:27.058 --> 45:28.891
whenever one of you has
a stress-related heart attack

45:28.893 --> 45:30.693
on your way to an early grave.

45:30.695 --> 45:33.930
-Wow, sometimes you can be
such a sad, judgy dick.

45:33.932 --> 45:35.598
-I'm a dick?
-Uh-huh!

45:35.600 --> 45:37.233
-You're the one
who plus-oned me to a wedding

45:37.235 --> 45:39.202
without even asking
if I was available first.

45:39.204 --> 45:40.770
-Okay, I'm sorry.
I should have asked.

45:40.772 --> 45:43.106
-Shocking people
even go to those things anymore.

45:43.108 --> 45:45.641
I mean, how can you sit there
celebrating two morons

45:45.643 --> 45:47.577
who are just gonna be divorced
in five years.

45:47.579 --> 45:49.278
And you don't
just invite yourself

45:49.280 --> 45:51.214
to meet somebody's dad,
by the way.

45:51.216 --> 45:52.715
If I wanted you
to meet that asshole,

45:52.717 --> 45:54.317
I would have invited you.

45:54.319 --> 45:56.619
I would have -- I would have
invited you to meet him.

45:56.621 --> 45:59.122
That's personal, okay?
-I'm sorry.

45:59.124 --> 46:00.456
I didn't even realize
that you felt that way.

46:00.458 --> 46:02.125
-And what the fuck
are you sending me

46:02.127 --> 46:04.093
a relationship request for?

46:04.095 --> 46:06.229
Guess what, Steph,
the world of social media

46:06.231 --> 46:08.664
does not give two shits
if we are in a relationship

46:08.666 --> 46:10.967
or complicated
or -- or whatever.

46:10.969 --> 46:13.102
And I'm sorry if I refuse
to take what we have

46:13.104 --> 46:14.604
and shout it to cyberspace

46:14.606 --> 46:16.472
so people can like it
or comment on it

46:16.474 --> 46:18.941
whenever we put up
a photo of ourselves!

46:18.943 --> 46:20.510
And then when we
inevitably break up,

46:20.512 --> 46:24.781
have those exact same people
like that status.

46:24.783 --> 46:27.250
You just over-step --

46:27.252 --> 46:29.352
a lot, and I think
you should work on that.

46:29.354 --> 46:32.088
-Excuse me?!

46:32.090 --> 46:33.689
-I'm saying this because I care.

46:33.691 --> 46:37.827
-What do we have, Jefferson?
What do we have?

46:37.829 --> 46:40.696
-W-- we have this.
We have us.

46:40.698 --> 46:42.465
Christ, what do you want, Steph?

46:42.467 --> 46:44.534
I feel like I've been expressly
clear about what I want,

46:44.536 --> 46:46.469
and you're the one
who's gone changing the deal.

46:46.471 --> 46:48.304
-That's life!

46:48.306 --> 46:50.473
Things grow and change
and evolve!

46:50.475 --> 46:53.643
Relationships grow
and change and evolve.

46:53.645 --> 46:55.378
I can't do this anymore.

46:55.380 --> 46:57.180
I don't want
to be just a fuck buddy.

46:57.182 --> 46:59.048
-Fuck buddy?
We're not even fucking.

46:59.050 --> 47:01.617
You're leaving, remember?

47:02.386 --> 47:04.720
-Oh, I am so done with this.

47:04.722 --> 47:06.322
And you know what?

47:06.324 --> 47:08.057
It might shock you,
but I'm actually looking for

47:08.059 --> 47:09.659
something way more than a label.

47:09.661 --> 47:12.295
I'm looking for
a fucking partner in crime.

47:12.297 --> 47:14.030
-That you can just
get tired of and dump?

47:14.032 --> 47:16.465
-I am not your ex-girlfriend!

47:16.467 --> 47:18.467
I'm not gonna go hide
in some other man's penis!

47:18.469 --> 47:21.537
-Tell that to Josh.

47:21.539 --> 47:24.740
-You are
a self-fulfilling prophesy.

47:24.742 --> 47:26.676
-Another label, thank you.

47:39.723 --> 47:42.391
-Go after here.

47:44.394 --> 47:47.763
Okay, don't, that's cool.

48:07.251 --> 48:09.185
-Mmm!

48:09.187 --> 48:10.553
This was heavenly!

48:10.555 --> 48:11.854
-What I tell you?

48:11.856 --> 48:15.091
Cupcakes are the panacea
for all ailments.

48:15.093 --> 48:18.261
-Yeah, but now instead
of feeling sad, I feel guilty.

48:18.263 --> 48:20.596
Fat.
-You'll get over it.

48:20.598 --> 48:23.299
-What the hell's
a panacea anyway?

48:23.301 --> 48:25.701
-It's Greek for cure-all.

48:25.703 --> 48:27.236
-How do you know that?

48:27.238 --> 48:30.039
-I'm Greek.
-No, you're not.

48:30.041 --> 48:31.974
Are you?
-Half.

48:31.976 --> 48:33.609
-Maybe he's right.

48:33.611 --> 48:36.045
Maybe we are too young
to be thinking about the future.

48:36.047 --> 48:37.413
We should just
live in the moment.

48:37.415 --> 48:39.081
-No.

48:39.083 --> 48:41.550
Spending your twenties,
like, sowing your wild oats

48:41.552 --> 48:43.386
or finding yourself
or whatever

48:43.388 --> 48:44.987
is a bunch of malarkey.

48:44.989 --> 48:47.256
All that leaves you is
a biological clock

48:47.258 --> 48:49.825
ticking in tall boots,
going on eharmony dates

48:49.827 --> 48:52.461
with men in their 40s who still
collect action figures.

48:52.463 --> 48:55.298
-Did you just say "malarkey"?
-I'm bringing it back.

48:55.300 --> 48:56.966
You know what we should do?

48:56.968 --> 49:01.771
We should get dressed
and call some boys and go out.

49:01.773 --> 49:04.140
-After this.
-Attagirl.

49:12.349 --> 49:14.617
-5, 6, 7, 8.

49:14.619 --> 49:16.786
One, three...

49:16.788 --> 49:18.788
5, 6, 7, 8.

49:18.790 --> 49:20.423
And good.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.027
Lift up.

49:25.029 --> 49:27.129
Stop, stop, stop.

49:27.131 --> 49:30.666
Please, stop.
Everyone, come here a second.

49:34.504 --> 49:37.373
-That's great, but maybe
we should save the accounting

49:37.375 --> 49:40.776
for the apartment.

49:40.778 --> 49:42.979
Why don't we just go
to mount hood next year?

49:42.981 --> 49:44.547
-Please, if there's one thing
we are definitely doing

49:44.549 --> 49:47.717
this year,
it is going to mount hood.

49:53.056 --> 49:56.058
-Are we maybe running away
from something?

50:02.133 --> 50:04.533
-Sometimes you have to
have something and lose it

50:04.535 --> 50:07.136
to know why you wanted it
or needed it.

50:09.506 --> 50:11.574
-Are you talking about beer?

50:11.576 --> 50:13.009
'Cause I could really use
a beer.

50:15.413 --> 50:20.049
-Well, if you consider
my movie collection a shrine...

50:20.051 --> 50:22.151
Uh-oh.

50:22.153 --> 50:23.686
-Uh-oh, what?

50:26.257 --> 50:28.524
-Shit!

50:28.526 --> 50:29.892
Shit!

50:32.363 --> 50:34.363
Shit!

50:34.365 --> 50:36.999
Shit!
Who's the guy she's with?

50:37.001 --> 50:40.436
-A guy.
-That asshole!

50:40.438 --> 50:41.704
I bet he sells things.

50:41.706 --> 50:43.906
-We're all selling something.

50:46.209 --> 50:48.177
-Yep.

50:49.546 --> 50:51.280
-That was kind of funny?
-Yeah.

50:51.282 --> 50:53.249
-A lot of disinfectant.

50:53.251 --> 50:55.751
-Hey, hey, hey.

50:55.753 --> 50:56.786
Amy, good to see you.

50:56.788 --> 50:58.220
-No.

50:58.222 --> 51:00.289
-Oh, you must be Matt.

51:00.291 --> 51:02.925
No, no, Jason.
Ryan?

51:02.927 --> 51:04.693
-Okay.
-So many, I get 'em confused.

51:04.695 --> 51:06.228
What are you doing here?

51:06.230 --> 51:08.197
-Same thing everyone else
is doing here, I guess.

51:08.199 --> 51:09.865
-Pretending to have a good time
in your desperate attempt

51:09.867 --> 51:11.634
to convince ourselves we belong?

51:11.636 --> 51:13.302
-We're having a few drinks.

51:13.304 --> 51:15.371
What are you doing here?
-Pretending to have a good time

51:15.373 --> 51:17.273
in a desperate attempt
to convince myself I bel--

51:17.275 --> 51:18.908
-have you met Blake?
-Hey, what's up, guy?

51:18.910 --> 51:20.476
How's sales?
-Oh, pretty good.

51:20.478 --> 51:21.977
-Oh, really,
'cause I don't see any coffee.

51:21.979 --> 51:24.847
And we all know
that coffee is for closers.

51:26.283 --> 51:29.819
Stupid "glengarry Glen Ross" --
great movie,

51:29.821 --> 51:31.620
one of her favorites if you're
trying to get in her pants.

51:31.622 --> 51:33.722
Hey, can I --
can we talk privately?

51:33.724 --> 51:37.059
-Do you mind?
-No, he's good. Come on.

51:40.397 --> 51:44.166
- I have no idea who Matt is.

51:46.436 --> 51:48.070
-Who's the guy?
-Just a guy.

51:48.072 --> 51:50.239
-Just a guy, huh?
-Just a guy.

51:50.241 --> 51:52.608
Sensitive, intelligent,
sense of humor, cute smile.

51:52.610 --> 51:54.510
-Cute butt?
-Oh, you noticed, too?

51:54.512 --> 51:55.811
-Oh, that thing
is impossible to miss.

51:55.813 --> 51:57.580
That's a pilates ass,
by the way.

51:57.582 --> 52:00.916
I can't believe you brought
a date here to our bar.

52:00.918 --> 52:03.352
-I just met him,
he's not a date.

52:03.354 --> 52:05.588
And I didn't realize
this was <i> our</i> bar.

52:05.590 --> 52:08.424
-You know, I remember
when I was just the guy.

52:08.426 --> 52:09.992
-Yeah.

52:09.994 --> 52:12.261
Sad, 'cause
now you're just an asshole.

52:12.263 --> 52:16.298
-You know, from the start --
from the start,

52:16.300 --> 52:19.668
I said that if this happened
between us,

52:19.670 --> 52:22.771
that...This would happen.

52:22.773 --> 52:24.473
-I'm glad he's here,

52:24.475 --> 52:26.809
'cause now I won't make
some stupid mistake with you.

52:26.811 --> 52:28.477
-That's good.
-It's good.

52:28.479 --> 52:30.446
-Good.
-It's good.

52:34.986 --> 52:38.554
-What kind of stupid mistake
are you talking about?

52:44.961 --> 52:47.029
Probably shouldn't have had
that extra beer.

53:31.275 --> 53:35.044
-Maybe me focus on that
instead of mount hood this year.

53:39.717 --> 53:42.885
-What? What are you
talking about right now?

53:42.887 --> 53:44.920
-Don't be mad.

53:44.922 --> 53:47.423
I just...
Want to spend more time

53:47.425 --> 53:49.792
trying to find myself.

53:49.794 --> 53:51.727
-That's what we do
on the mountain.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.295
-Right, no, we do.

53:53.297 --> 53:55.898
But I think I'm growing
beyond the mountain.

53:55.900 --> 53:58.133
-Beyond the mountain?
-Plus, my parents

53:58.135 --> 54:00.102
are hassling me
about not paying rent,

54:00.104 --> 54:01.570
especially for
the three or four months

54:01.572 --> 54:02.905
that I'm not even home.

54:02.907 --> 54:04.473
-So get a sublet.

54:04.475 --> 54:05.774
That's what people do,
they get sublets.

54:05.776 --> 54:07.776
I'll help you, okay?
-Right.

54:07.778 --> 54:10.579
No, I know.

54:10.581 --> 54:13.882
Also...I want to take
some more dance classes,

54:13.884 --> 54:15.784
and that's pretty spendy.

54:19.122 --> 54:21.790
-Dance classes?

54:26.930 --> 54:30.899
This ski trip
is all I've wanted all year.

54:30.901 --> 54:33.435
It is all I've been working
these mind-numbing,

54:33.437 --> 54:36.305
soul-sucking jobs for.

54:36.307 --> 54:40.175
And you're just gonna take it
away from me so you can dance?!

54:40.177 --> 54:41.644
-You can have the money.

54:41.646 --> 54:44.313
-It's not about the money,
asshole!

54:44.315 --> 54:46.148
It's about the fucking plan!

54:46.150 --> 54:47.950
You had a plan,
and you're not sticking to it!

54:47.952 --> 54:49.852
-How am I an asshole
for just not doing

54:49.854 --> 54:52.388
what you want me to do?!
-Fuck you!

55:21.451 --> 55:23.218
<i> -Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

55:23.220 --> 55:25.354
<i> Oh, yeah, yeah.</i>
<i> Oh.</i>

55:25.356 --> 55:28.657
<i> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>
<i> Oh, yeah.</i>

55:28.659 --> 55:32.394
<i> Oh, fuck!</i>
<i> Oh, yeah. Oh! Oh!</i>

55:32.396 --> 55:35.297
<i> Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah!</i>
<i> I want it!</i>

55:35.299 --> 55:38.901
-Sorry, is it too loud?
Need me to headphone it?

55:38.903 --> 55:41.670
I'll headphone it.

55:45.408 --> 55:47.710
-Oh, hey, man.

55:49.079 --> 55:51.647
-Dropped your shit.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.370
-Wow. Cleaning.

56:14.372 --> 56:17.239
-I'm having a friend come visit.

56:17.241 --> 56:20.376
-We're having a friend come?
-Uh, from Canada.

56:20.378 --> 56:22.511
I told her she could stay here,
so...

56:22.513 --> 56:27.116
You know, she's going to come
in just a little while.

56:27.118 --> 56:30.185
-From Canada.
-Yep.

56:30.187 --> 56:33.021
-You need me to leave
for a while or...

56:36.393 --> 56:38.460
-Yeah, or...

56:38.462 --> 56:40.696
Yeah.

56:42.565 --> 56:44.933
-You need me to move out?

56:44.935 --> 56:46.635
-I think.

56:46.637 --> 56:49.238
Maybe.

56:49.240 --> 56:53.142
Yeah.

56:53.144 --> 56:55.043
-Oh, that's cool.

56:55.045 --> 56:57.446
That's cool, I get it.

56:57.448 --> 56:59.782
All right, yeah.
You've been...

56:59.784 --> 57:04.586
Very generous...
Letting me stay here this long.

57:04.588 --> 57:07.823
Uh...
Thank your parents for me.

57:07.825 --> 57:11.293
I'm gonna go...Get packing.

57:11.295 --> 57:17.166
-You're still welcome to
swing by and hang if you want.

57:17.168 --> 57:21.003
-Well, I have no one else,
so...

57:22.238 --> 57:25.207
-Do you want me to make
some home-made ice cream?

58:12.155 --> 58:13.789
-Sea lion war!

58:13.791 --> 58:15.324
Sometimes they go at it
all night.

58:15.326 --> 58:18.160
I just lay here listening.

58:18.162 --> 58:21.363
Arf, arf! Arf, arf!

58:21.365 --> 58:24.633
I love it! This is my pbs!

58:26.469 --> 58:29.304
Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf!

58:29.306 --> 58:31.707
I love it!

58:46.089 --> 58:48.524
-So I've never really
worked with butt plugs before.

58:48.526 --> 58:50.192
Is there anything I should know?

58:50.194 --> 58:52.361
-We pride ourselves
on being a safe zone

58:52.363 --> 58:55.364
for people to explore
and express their sexuality.

58:55.366 --> 58:57.232
What we don't want
is those dirty raincoat-ers

58:57.234 --> 58:59.701
coming in, looking at our boxes
for an hour,

58:59.703 --> 59:02.337
and then going to jerk it
in the alleyway.

59:02.339 --> 59:04.873
-So my job is to keep browsing
and masturbating to a minimum.

59:04.875 --> 59:07.342
-Shit, those have been recalled.

59:07.344 --> 59:09.611
-So how long
you been working here?

59:09.613 --> 59:11.880
-About a year. But it's not
like I'm gonna move up.

59:11.882 --> 59:15.250
I've already hit the glass
ceiling.

59:15.252 --> 59:18.654
-You mean the mirrored ceiling.

59:24.361 --> 59:26.461
-Oh, you got it.

59:26.463 --> 59:29.264
-You are bad!
I gotta watch out for you.

59:29.266 --> 59:30.933
So bad.

59:30.935 --> 59:33.235
-Bet you get hit on relentlessly
at a place like this.

59:33.237 --> 59:35.804
-Yeah, but no one
ever takes me seriously.

59:35.806 --> 59:39.474
But it's not like I'm looking
for anything serious, so...

59:39.476 --> 59:41.710
-Thank you! That's the kind
of girl I'd love to go out with.

59:45.648 --> 59:48.317
-You would love to go out
with me?

59:48.319 --> 59:49.785
-I was just saying.

59:49.787 --> 59:51.420
-Oh, my gosh,
are you serious right now?

59:51.422 --> 59:53.055
You --
you better not be kidding!

59:53.057 --> 59:54.623
You're not kidding, right?
You're serious, right?

59:54.625 --> 59:57.459
You're serious?!

59:57.461 --> 59:59.094
-I mean...

59:59.096 --> 01:00:00.495
Would you want to go out
with me?

01:00:00.497 --> 01:00:01.997
-Yes! Yeah, I would!

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:04.132
I do! Yes, I do.
Yes.

01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:06.435
You're not kidding, right?

01:00:06.437 --> 01:00:08.737
-I mean, it's probably not wise,

01:00:08.739 --> 01:00:12.507
seeing as, like, you're my boss.

01:00:12.509 --> 01:00:15.243
-Oh.

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:17.446
Oh. Yeah.

01:00:17.448 --> 01:00:20.749
Yeah, that, yeah.

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:22.784
-But, like, if you want to.

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:25.487
-Yes! Oh, my gosh, please!
Yes, yes, are you serious?

01:00:25.489 --> 01:00:26.955
I want to go out and drink.

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:28.123
Oh, I might have to fire you
first, though.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:29.625
-Huh?
-I'm kidding, I won't.

01:00:29.627 --> 01:00:31.460
I'm kidding.
But anyway, I don't know.

01:00:31.462 --> 01:00:33.528
So.

01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:34.930
Wow. Okay.

01:00:34.932 --> 01:00:37.933
Yes.

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:44.306
-Yo, Curtis?

01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:46.541
Knock, knock.

01:00:46.543 --> 01:00:50.045
You would not believe the job
i just got.

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:55.450
Curtis?

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.687
Curtis?

01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:01.289
-Natalie Simmons is dead.

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:03.825
-Wait.

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:06.061
Wait, high school
Natalie Simmons?

01:01:06.063 --> 01:01:09.064
The cheerleader with the wonky
Isabella rossellini teeth?

01:01:09.066 --> 01:01:12.134
-She was eaten by a bear.

01:01:12.136 --> 01:01:14.836
-Natalie Simmons
was eaten by a bear?

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:17.305
-In shoshone national park.

01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:19.174
It's a statistical
improbability,

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:23.478
yet Natalie Simmons
was eaten by a bear.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.847
-Wow.

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:29.017
Shit, I really liked her.
I liked her teeth.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:32.888
-She was right next
to Allison in the yearbook.

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:35.157
-That's a strange coincidence.

01:01:35.159 --> 01:01:38.360
-Death is working its way
outward from the "s's,"

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:41.697
and eventually,
it's going to get us all.

01:01:41.699 --> 01:01:45.267
You just never know when a bear
is gonna pop out and eat you.

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:49.204
-You could avoid going to places
where bears are.

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:51.173
-The proverbial bear.

01:01:51.175 --> 01:01:55.844
Eaten by the proverbial bear!

01:01:58.182 --> 01:02:00.415
I missed you, too.

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:08.857
I wonder what Stephanie's up to
right now.

01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:12.094
-When's the last time
you talked to her?

01:02:12.096 --> 01:02:14.896
-When we saw her at the bar.

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:16.932
I befouled it, man.

01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:18.366
I totally befouled it.

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:22.671
-She's probably at home,
wondering about you.

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:25.741
-See these new
rossignol super 7s?

01:02:25.743 --> 01:02:28.910
Supposed to cut powder
like butter.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:31.747
-You're still planning
on mount hood?

01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:35.083
It's the only thing
i have left to look forward to.

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:37.986
So...Uh...

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:41.189
-Unh-unh. No.

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:50.465
I'll miss you, Natalie Simmons.

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:55.237
-Yes.
-Come on.

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:58.140
-Ooh. God.
-See?

01:02:58.142 --> 01:03:00.142
-Jesus.

01:03:00.144 --> 01:03:03.278
-We're gonna have so much fun.
-So much. All the fun.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.181
-Can dress each other up.
-Dress up each other?

01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:10.852
We should probably get some help
though, because...

01:03:10.854 --> 01:03:12.087
-Hey, dude.

01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:19.261
-Yes. Hello, I can help you.
Can I help you?

01:03:19.263 --> 01:03:22.564
-Um, we were looking
to upgrade her vibrator.

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:27.803
-She currently owns a vibrator.

01:03:27.805 --> 01:03:30.005
Um, do you know, like, what size
or do you know what kind?

01:03:30.007 --> 01:03:31.473
-It's a little one.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:35.777
It makes like a noise like...
Mee! Mee!

01:03:35.779 --> 01:03:37.312
-Right, and it's just not quite
getting the job done, right?

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:39.314
Meee! Meee!

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:42.284
Isn't quite doing it.
And you need this device?

01:03:42.286 --> 01:03:43.985
You can't bring her
to completion on your own?

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:45.620
-Oh, no,
it's like a new addition.

01:03:45.622 --> 01:03:46.988
Like, we're...

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.356
When she likes to go down.

01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:50.392
Down...Down there.

01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:53.595
-She -- she goes down for you?

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:56.631
-Right, like a -- like a blowie.

01:03:56.633 --> 01:03:58.166
-Oh.

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.168
-So you got --
so you got one that goes "meee!"

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:03.004
And you want to go, like
"rah!" Or "errr!"

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:06.575
While she's...Performing.

01:04:06.577 --> 01:04:08.176
-Yes.
-Let me ask you something.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:09.578
How long
have you two been together?

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.847
-Not important.
-Eight years.

01:04:11.849 --> 01:04:15.350
-Eight years.

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:17.686
Wow!
-We recently just took a break,

01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:19.354
and i-i think
it really strengthened us.

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:21.523
-Yeah, made me realize
what's important.

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:25.360
Which is why we are here
trying out some fun new toys.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:28.330
Anyways, when you have someone
like her, you gotta...

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:30.398
You gotta fight for it.
-Absolutely.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.200
But now you're having trouble
sexually satisfying each other,

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:33.668
so you're here
buying a little help.

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:36.104
Okay, let's see what we can do.
Follow me.

01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:38.206
Okay, so I'm guessing
from your description

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:40.275
that this is the bad boy
she had before.

01:04:40.277 --> 01:04:42.043
-Wow, yeah, man, that's it.

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:44.212
-Okay, so let me direct
your attention to this bad boy.

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:47.215
It has all the latest
in dildonic technology.

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:49.384
Variable speeds,
you can go from meee!,

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:51.519
to rah!,
to dugga-dugga-dugga-dugga,

01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:54.689
depending on your -- excuse me,
<i> her</i> desire for stimulation.

01:04:54.691 --> 01:04:57.959
-Uh...I don't know.

01:04:57.961 --> 01:04:59.728
Babe, I don't know.
What do you think?

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:01.696
It's your orgasm.

01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:05.867
What do you think?

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:09.571
-I think while you and the guy
from "police academy" decide

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:12.107
which sound effect
works best on my clitoris,

01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:14.242
I'm gonna go across the street
to chipotle,

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:17.679
hope that they have alcohol,
and go get drunk in my car.

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:23.785
- "Police academy"?

01:05:23.787 --> 01:05:25.453
-Why don't I show you a couple
other things

01:05:25.455 --> 01:05:27.389
I think she might like.
Pretty sure I know her type.

01:05:27.391 --> 01:05:29.591
Let's start with some handcuffs.

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:31.660
-All right, all right.

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:35.597
-You give him blow jobs?
-Hello!

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:37.465
-Ha! You give him blowies?
I thought you don't do that.

01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:40.936
-I don't. It was something
special that I did with him.

01:05:40.938 --> 01:05:42.971
-Do you even have lockjaw?

01:05:42.973 --> 01:05:44.439
-That's what made it special.

01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:48.109
I suffered for his pleasure.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:51.479
-Oh, god!
-It was personal!

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:54.115
I don't know
what you want me to say.

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:57.118
-I miss you.
-It's hard to miss someone

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.588
when you're busy
living in the moment.

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:02.424
Sorry.

01:06:02.426 --> 01:06:04.092
I was trying to be somebody
I'm not.

01:06:04.094 --> 01:06:05.460
I like being in a relationship.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:08.697
I like being in something
that's defined.

01:06:08.699 --> 01:06:12.000
-I'm -- I'm ready for that now.

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:15.270
Let's do it.
Let's do it, I'm ready. Okay?

01:06:15.272 --> 01:06:18.506
-It's so funny how you feel
this way after I leave.

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:25.213
-Sometimes you have to have
something and lose it

01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:28.316
in order to understand
why you want or need it.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:31.119
-And that's how I feel
about Josh.

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:36.024
-Please, just give this
another chance.

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:38.026
I know we have something, okay,

01:06:38.028 --> 01:06:41.663
and you know we have something.

01:06:41.665 --> 01:06:43.331
Please,
just give this another chance.

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:45.166
I-i-i this is gonna be
a clean start, okay?

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:47.168
Let's just -- let's just do --
I'll change the --

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:49.237
I'll change the relationship
status. I'll accept it.

01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:51.673
We'll -- let's do it.
Let's do it your way.

01:06:51.675 --> 01:06:54.075
-Jefferson...

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:56.511
It's over.

01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:58.213
-Stop it!

01:06:58.215 --> 01:06:59.848
Don't say it's over.

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:02.083
I am here, and I'm asking you
for another chance.

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:04.686
This does not have to be over.
-Jefferson!

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:06.755
-This can be a clean start.
No, this can --

01:07:06.757 --> 01:07:09.591
-it's over.
-No, let's --

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.967
I love you.

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.963
-Okay.

01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:53.568
-Bye.

01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:10.819
Buddy, hello?

01:08:10.821 --> 01:08:14.456
-These Tibetan monks
spend 12 painstaking months

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:16.925
creating these mandalas
with colored sand,

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:20.995
and I mean one grain at time.

01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:25.100
The lama comes,
and he inspects each mandala,

01:08:25.102 --> 01:08:27.102
and he gives his holy nod
of approval.

01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:29.737
And then
he whisks the sand away,

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:33.341
just brushes it with a graceful
of his hand,

01:08:33.343 --> 01:08:36.810
leaving behind just a smudge
of nothingness.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:46.921
-Somebody I know
was eaten by a bear.

01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:48.790
I'm working at a whack shack,

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:50.825
and I irrevocably fucked up
the one relationship

01:08:50.827 --> 01:08:53.962
I had in my life
that actually mattered,

01:08:53.964 --> 01:08:55.430
and you're talking to me

01:08:55.432 --> 01:08:59.000
about the impermanence
of sand mandalas?

01:08:59.002 --> 01:09:02.537
-Hey, it's not
about the mandalas themselves,

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:04.872
it's about --
-i know what it's about.

01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:06.707
You're ridiculous.

01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:09.144
You're 50 years old, you live
on a boat that you don't own.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.212
-I know it's
an unbelievable life.

01:09:11.214 --> 01:09:14.549
-Unbelievably sad!

01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:17.551
You just gave up, dad.

01:09:18.453 --> 01:09:19.621
-Oh, wow.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:20.854
Okay, Jeffy, I get it.

01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:22.323
You know,
you have your perspective,

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:25.859
but I'm over here with mine,
and it's cool.

01:09:25.862 --> 01:09:27.729
No one's right, no one's wrong.

01:09:27.731 --> 01:09:30.665
-No, dad, you...Have to...

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:33.835
Always wrap everything up
in some new-age psycho-babble

01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:35.303
self-help doublespeak
that no one understands,

01:09:35.305 --> 01:09:38.238
including yourself.

01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:40.808
-I am that.
-See?!

01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:43.511
You always say that!
"I am that." What is that?

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:45.546
I-i-it's like y-you think
you're empathizing,

01:09:45.549 --> 01:09:47.549
but really what you're doing
is invalidating

01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:50.018
anybody's sense of self.

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:52.252
It's maddening. I'm mad.

01:09:52.255 --> 01:09:54.656
You're fucking high, as usual.

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:59.227
- I am that.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:07.502
-Strange
that I feel completely adrift

01:10:07.504 --> 01:10:09.103
in every aspect of my life.

01:10:09.105 --> 01:10:12.440
-Man, you set me up
for that one.

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:15.843
Jeffy, where you going?

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:18.246
-To not be you.

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:09.724
<i> -Good night, pappy.</i>

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:32.547
-Oh, my goodness.

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.824
-I can't believe
you're missing my debut.

01:12:42.826 --> 01:12:45.360
-Sorry, man, I just can't go
if Stephanie's gonna be there.

01:12:45.362 --> 01:12:47.362
Why would you invite her?

01:12:47.364 --> 01:12:50.698
-I just sent out a mass invite
to everyone I know.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.668
Plus, I thought you guys
might get back together,

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:56.537
so I might have sent her
a special e-mail

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:58.740
asking her to come.

01:12:58.742 --> 01:13:01.442
-Curtis, do me a favor and just
don't ever try and help, okay?

01:13:01.444 --> 01:13:03.544
-Don't you think
that she's going in hopes

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:04.846
that you might be there?

01:13:04.848 --> 01:13:06.247
-No, I think she's coming

01:13:06.249 --> 01:13:07.548
because she's
a completely decent person

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.050
who wants to support you.

01:13:09.052 --> 01:13:10.918
That's fine,
I'll just come to the next one.

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.687
-Mmm.

01:13:12.689 --> 01:13:14.355
One and done, my friend.

01:13:14.357 --> 01:13:16.691
My parents are cutting me off.

01:13:16.693 --> 01:13:19.560
I have to get a real job.

01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:22.096
They were pretty pissed
when they found out

01:13:22.098 --> 01:13:26.601
that I was spending my money
on dance classes.

01:13:26.603 --> 01:13:29.771
-What about having the soul
of an artist and all that?

01:13:29.773 --> 01:13:31.439
-It's cool.

01:13:31.441 --> 01:13:33.274
It's time to grow up.

01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:36.577
Besides, dance classes are kind
of silly anyway.

01:13:57.833 --> 01:14:00.168
-Schmancy!

01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:02.637
How can you afford this
on what we're paying you?

01:14:02.639 --> 01:14:05.940
-Well, I was actually kind
of hoping we'd go Dutch.

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:07.842
-You're funny.

01:14:07.844 --> 01:14:10.411
That was the first thing
i noticed about you.

01:14:10.413 --> 01:14:13.247
You're really...Funny.

01:14:13.249 --> 01:14:16.250
-Ha. I...Was actually
only half-joking --

01:14:16.252 --> 01:14:18.319
Dutch joking, if you will.

01:14:26.495 --> 01:14:29.597
Well, what was the first thing
you noticed about me?

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:33.201
- Your tits.

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:02.230
Are you okay?

01:15:05.168 --> 01:15:07.301
-I'm...I'm sorry.

01:15:07.303 --> 01:15:09.737
I'm sorry.

01:15:09.739 --> 01:15:14.509
Just guys never take me out
on, like, a real date, you know,

01:15:14.511 --> 01:15:20.381
and, I mean, I'm just...
I --

01:15:20.383 --> 01:15:23.084
thank you.

01:15:23.086 --> 01:15:26.387
Thank you.

01:15:26.389 --> 01:15:29.590
-Yeah, yeah, no problem.

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:36.397
-Shit, fuck, motherfucker!

01:15:40.169 --> 01:15:43.271
- All right!

01:15:43.273 --> 01:15:45.006
All right, yeah, man.
Dig it.

01:15:45.008 --> 01:15:47.942
Let's keep it going
for x Javier, huh?

01:15:47.944 --> 01:15:50.444
You guys are in
for a real treat tonight.

01:15:50.446 --> 01:15:54.382
We've got a first-timer
here on our open-Mike stage --

01:15:54.384 --> 01:15:57.552
Curtis ashante!

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:02.456
-Thank you.

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:07.595
Hi, everybody.

01:16:07.597 --> 01:16:14.101
This is my movement poem called
"eaten by the proverbial bear."

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:21.909
-So do you want to make out
or something?

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.210
-Mmm.

01:16:23.212 --> 01:16:25.580
I kind of do
and I kind of don't.

01:16:25.582 --> 01:16:27.448
-No pressure.

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:31.252
Just so you know, I'm --
I'm open to it.

01:16:31.254 --> 01:16:32.820
-My best friend's
having a show right now

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:37.058
and I'm missing it because
there's this girl, and...

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:38.793
We were friends,
and we were more than friends,

01:16:38.795 --> 01:16:41.796
and anyway,
she's going, so I'm not.

01:16:41.798 --> 01:16:44.632
-You're missing your best
friend's show because of a girl?

01:16:44.634 --> 01:16:46.167
-Yeah.

01:16:46.169 --> 01:16:47.568
-That's so shitty.

01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:49.670
-I know.

01:16:49.672 --> 01:16:51.606
-But, I mean,
if we're not gonna make out,

01:16:51.608 --> 01:16:54.408
I mean, what do you want to do,
because I made up this new rule,

01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:56.477
no sex before kissing first.

01:16:56.479 --> 01:16:58.813
-Fuck, what am I doing?
-That's what I was saying!

01:16:58.815 --> 01:17:01.015
That's why I made up
this new rule.

01:17:01.017 --> 01:17:03.117
-You wouldn't want to go see my
friend's solo dance performance

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:05.586
that he choreographed himself
at a local dive bar, would you?

01:17:05.588 --> 01:17:07.288
-Yeah.
-Really?

01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:09.090
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

01:17:09.092 --> 01:17:12.126
-Mm-hmm. And, I mean, if you
want to make out after, I can.

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:14.528
I pretty much
make out with anybody.

01:17:36.119 --> 01:17:37.718
-I'm gonna go to
the bathroom real quick, okay?

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:41.275

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.651
-Yeah, I mean,
i do like the beach a lot.

01:20:57.653 --> 01:21:01.088
I like living near the water's
always one of those things

01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:02.890
that is like a must.

01:21:02.892 --> 01:21:06.594
You know, that's why,
you know, I couldn't, like...

01:21:06.596 --> 01:21:09.029
Hey.
-Hey.

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:13.100
-What are you doing back?
-I came here to give you this.

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.871
-What is this?
-It's dance classes.

01:21:16.873 --> 01:21:19.039
Don't say anything,
just take it.

01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:22.209
-You are my friend.

01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:23.377
-Oh! Okay.

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:27.047
I...I am that.

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:28.415
-Oh, where are my manners?

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:30.918
This is my friend,
Chloe, from Canada.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.554
-Chloe from Canada.

01:21:33.556 --> 01:21:37.124
-And this is my friend, Gloria.

01:21:37.126 --> 01:21:39.526
-Hi. Sorry, I was trying
to get a drink.

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:41.128
That bartender hates me.

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:43.397
-Did you ask him.
-Ask me what?

01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:45.366
-Okay, you have to
settle this for us.

01:21:45.368 --> 01:21:46.934
They're trying to say
that Godzilla is a female,

01:21:46.936 --> 01:21:49.436
but there's no way.
-There's totally a way.

01:21:49.438 --> 01:21:52.072
-Okay, it has a kid
in "Godzilla's revenge," but --

01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:54.275
-that hardly
qualifies as a movie.

01:21:54.277 --> 01:21:56.710
-Exactly. Thank you.

01:21:59.881 --> 01:22:02.049
-Ha.

01:22:02.051 --> 01:22:04.485
Let me, uh, buy you a drink.
-Yeah.

01:22:04.487 --> 01:22:08.055
-Yeah. Um, okay, question,
Godzilla versus king Kong?

01:22:08.057 --> 01:22:09.757
-King Kong.

01:22:09.759 --> 01:22:11.292
-Yes!
