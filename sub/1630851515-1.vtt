00:04.963 --> 00:07.549
(gentle music)

00:31.573 --> 00:33.450
- [Mr. Black] Come on, Sam.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.285
Wake up, little boy.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.495
Sleepy time's over.

00:37.495 --> 00:38.913
Yo, Mr. Paxton.

00:39.831 --> 00:40.915
Come on Sam,

00:40.915 --> 00:43.001
don't make me have to
start chopping limbs here.

00:44.711 --> 00:45.545
Come on.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.505
There he is.

00:47.505 --> 00:50.717
The man of the hour
has officially arrived.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.135
Let me just say how good it is

00:52.135 --> 00:53.887
to finally meet ya, Sam.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.849

- [Sam] You swing like a girl.

02:11.297 --> 02:14.592
Jesus Christ, you look like shit.

02:22.642 --> 02:26.312
- [Jimmy] Yeah well you're
still fucking short.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.064
Even with those lifts in your boots.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.820
(both laughing)

02:35.655 --> 02:36.614
- [Sam] Look at you.

02:36.614 --> 02:39.200
God damn, you look like my sister.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.785
- [Jimmy] I know, tell me about it.

02:40.785 --> 02:41.619
Why, is she hot?

02:42.495 --> 02:43.621
- [Sam] Eh, she's better looking than you.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.123
- [Jimmy] It's nice you came to visit.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.002
You can leave that open.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.421
- [Sam] Yeah, you should
probably let this place air out.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.465
- [Jimmy] Want a beer?

02:55.925 --> 02:59.053
- [Sam] Ah shit man, is
there a fucking choice?

02:59.053 --> 03:00.513
- [Jimmy] Not really.

03:03.766 --> 03:06.019
- Welcome to paradise.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.063
- [Sam] Paradise, is that
what we're calling this place?

03:09.063 --> 03:09.898
Okay

03:10.982 --> 03:12.233
- [Jimmy] How've you been?

03:13.651 --> 03:15.361
How's the misses?

03:15.361 --> 03:16.196
How's your mom?

03:19.949 --> 03:20.783
Sorry buddy.

03:20.783 --> 03:21.868
- [Sam] Don't be sorry, man.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.161
It's all right.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.495
Cancer's a bitch, brother.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.292
- [Jimmy] Yeah, too bad some
things that could really help

03:29.292 --> 03:30.126
are illegal.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.964
- [Sam] That's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

03:37.716 --> 03:39.802
What are you doing for
money nowadays, Jimmy?

03:39.802 --> 03:42.055
- [Jimmy] Staying out of
trouble, that's what matters.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.682
- [Sam] Well, you remember
that second tour in Kandahar?

03:46.434 --> 03:47.518
Remember the village,

03:49.437 --> 03:50.897
the one with the marijuana fields?

03:51.814 --> 03:53.983
- [Jimmy] You trying to get
me to grow pot with you, Sam?

03:57.487 --> 04:00.240
- [Sam] Look, we learned
something major over there, man.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.492
You gonna tell me that putting that to use

04:02.492 --> 04:04.327
and making some money out of it,

04:06.704 --> 04:08.248
that's something you never thought of?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.249
- [Jimmy] I'm not your guy.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.042
- [Sam] No?

04:12.335 --> 04:15.838
No, you're right, I must be
mistaking you for the other guy

04:15.838 --> 04:17.839
with the foreclosure notice on his door.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.094
- [Jimmy] Thanks for the visit, Sam.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.932
- [Sam] Look, Jimmy, what
are you gonna do, huh?

04:25.932 --> 04:27.934
At some point, someone is
gonna come and kick you out

04:27.934 --> 04:30.103
of your paradise here.

04:31.145 --> 04:33.231
And then you're either
gonna end up back over there

04:33.231 --> 04:34.983
or somewhere worse.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.359
No hey, listen to me, look,

04:36.359 --> 04:37.902
I watched my mother wither away

04:37.902 --> 04:39.988
when I knew I could have
done something about it.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.490
I'm not talking about fucking
selling weed here, Jimmy,

04:42.490 --> 04:45.284
I'm talking about doing
something real. Okay?

04:45.284 --> 04:48.454
Cancer? It's curable.

04:48.454 --> 04:51.457
It's more of a business
than it is a disease.

04:51.457 --> 04:54.127
(ominous music)

04:55.753 --> 04:56.713
- [Jimmy] You know those
weren't all marijuana fields

04:56.713 --> 04:57.797
out there in Kandahar.

04:59.173 --> 05:03.261
Half that was poppy. Opium fields.

05:05.054 --> 05:05.888
- [Sam] Exactly.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.977
(adventurous music)

05:37.211 --> 05:40.465
(classical rock music)

06:23.007 --> 06:25.051
- [Tim] Marijuana's only been
only illegal all these years

06:25.051 --> 06:27.804
because of the big fat douche bags

06:27.804 --> 06:29.097
running corporate America.

06:30.431 --> 06:35.395
(ominous music)
(breathing deeply)

06:43.861 --> 06:46.781
First, it was William Randolph Hearst

06:46.781 --> 06:47.865
looking to line of pockets

06:47.865 --> 06:49.951
of his newspaper empire with gold.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.703
Then in the '80s,

06:52.703 --> 06:54.831
pharmaceutical companies.

06:54.831 --> 06:55.915
They kept this shit,

06:58.876 --> 07:00.670
a schedule one narcotic,

07:00.670 --> 07:03.631
because it helps fight diseases
that they don't want cured.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.759
Because if they help heal everyone,

07:08.553 --> 07:11.931
who are they gonna get to buy the drugs?

07:15.017 --> 07:17.687
(ominous music)

07:20.189 --> 07:21.357
- [Sam] Look, what do you
think is gonna happen?

07:21.357 --> 07:22.191
What, they're gonna buy my research

07:22.191 --> 07:24.068
and start clinical trials?

07:24.068 --> 07:25.570
- [Amanda] You sound like
some tree hugging hippie.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.114
You do not know what's gonna happen.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.699
- [Sam] Oh I don't, huh?

07:30.616 --> 07:32.534
- [Amanda] No, you don't, Sam.

07:32.534 --> 07:33.369
Do you ever think

07:33.369 --> 07:35.413
you just don't want to see
your work come to an end?

07:35.413 --> 07:37.290
I love your passion, but
what's the point of all this

07:37.290 --> 07:39.459
if you're just gonna
hold your work hostage?

07:43.087 --> 07:45.339
- [Sam] Let's not forget here, Amanda,

07:45.339 --> 07:46.757
I grow marijuana, all right?

07:48.092 --> 07:50.052
- [Amanda] Excuse me, I
do not give my husband up

07:50.052 --> 07:51.220
four nights a week

07:51.220 --> 07:52.847
for marijuana.

07:54.765 --> 07:55.808
You know Mrs. Singer?

07:56.933 --> 07:58.186
- [Sam] Yeah, yeah, she's the one

07:58.186 --> 08:00.646
that calls me Kevin Bacon, right?

08:00.646 --> 08:02.315
Wait, she didn't?

08:02.315 --> 08:04.108
- [Amanda] She went into
remission this week.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.820
- [Sam] She's stage four
pancreatic, that's impossible.

08:07.820 --> 08:08.905
- [Amanda] They're calling it a miracle.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.073
All the doctors are taking credit for it.

08:11.073 --> 08:13.284
In reality, I've been
giving her your CBD extract

08:13.284 --> 08:14.619
for the past three months.

08:15.828 --> 08:16.662
- [Sam] Amanda, you've been administering

08:16.662 --> 08:17.497
my formula to patients?

08:19.165 --> 08:20.917
- [Amanda] Look, I know we
said we weren't going to,

08:20.917 --> 08:22.668
but babe, it works.

08:22.668 --> 08:23.503
- [Sam] No, no, no, look, that is

08:23.503 --> 08:24.587
it's far from FDA approved.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.632
You can get in a lot of
trouble if you get caught.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.258
- [Amanda] Well maybe it'd be legal

08:29.258 --> 08:32.303
if you started playing ball
with the rest of the world.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.972
(ominous music)

08:36.849 --> 08:40.061
Look, I know you have your reasons.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.104
- [Sam] No, we're not talking about that.

08:44.482 --> 08:47.026
- [Nurse] Hey Amanda, Barry
wants to see you in his office.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.153
- [Amanda] I got to go.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.530
I'll call you back later, bye.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.283
- [Sam] Yeah? Love you too.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.496
(ominous music)

08:58.496 --> 09:02.291
- [Ace] You lose 50K at
one of Mr. Black's tables.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.418
Now that's just fine, hell that's dandy.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.379
We see that kind of thing all the time.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.257
We extend you a line of credit
to make your money back.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.009
We don't need to do that, but we did.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.636
You make your money back.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.346
You make our money back.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.056
Time to settle up and walk away.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.225
But you didn't settle up now did you boy?

09:19.225 --> 09:21.018
You did not walk away.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.189
- [Parker] It's gambling,
that's how it works sometimes.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.733
(laughing)

09:27.733 --> 09:28.568
- [Ace] You hear that?

09:28.568 --> 09:30.653
He's trying to tell me how gambling works.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.321
- [Parker] Ah, God damn it.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.827
- [Ace] Oh. Evening boss.

09:37.827 --> 09:42.832
- [Mr. Black] Well, well, Mr.
Renfro. How are we tonight?

09:43.332 --> 09:44.165
- [Parker] Please, I was telling your man,

09:44.165 --> 09:45.001
I can get you your money.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.588
- [Mr. Black] These things
really start to blur together

09:48.588 --> 09:49.422
after a while, don't they?

09:49.422 --> 09:52.383
- [Ace] That they do, boss. That they do.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.217
- [Mr. Black] Unfortunately,
you know how many guys

09:53.217 --> 09:54.051
sat in that chair

09:56.095 --> 09:58.097
and told me the same load of horse crap?

09:58.097 --> 10:01.183
- [Parker] I know. I understand
that, but I can deliver,

10:01.183 --> 10:03.102
you just got to give me a couple days.

10:04.729 --> 10:05.563
- [Mr. Black] What's he owe?

10:05.563 --> 10:06.897
- [Ace] About $100,000.

10:08.190 --> 10:11.110
- [Mr. Black] Whoa,
rich blood, Mr. Renfro.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.197
How do you plan on paying
me back in a couple of days?

10:16.157 --> 10:17.241
Mommy and daddy

10:18.951 --> 10:20.286
or back to the fucking tables?

10:22.747 --> 10:24.165
That's what I thought, Ace.

10:24.165 --> 10:24.999
- [Ace] Yes, sir.

10:26.208 --> 10:29.045
- [Parker] Marijuana, marijuana, hey.

10:29.045 --> 10:29.879
- [Mr. Black] You want
to pay me back 100 grand

10:29.879 --> 10:30.713
in marijuana?

10:31.922 --> 10:33.507
- [Parker] More, double,
triple, just make him stop.

10:33.507 --> 10:34.967
- [Mr. Black] Hold up, Ace.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.469
- [Parker] Fuck, thank God.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.804
- [Ace] I would not thank God just yet.

10:38.804 --> 10:39.972
- [Mr. Black] He's right.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.557
My curiosity doesn't last that long.

10:41.557 --> 10:42.391
- [Ace] No.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.895
- [Parker] Okay so my grandma
has this ranch, all right?

10:45.895 --> 10:48.522
And a few years ago she
took on this new tenant,

10:48.522 --> 10:50.733
this medical marijuana collective.

10:50.733 --> 10:51.817
- [Mr. Black] Are you trying to tell us

10:51.817 --> 10:53.736
that your granny owns a pot farm?

10:55.071 --> 10:57.782
- Oh, kid, I may be a lot of things,

10:57.782 --> 11:00.368
but a pot dealer ain't
on the fucking list.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.827
- [Parker] You don't understand.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.621
This guy, Sam Paxton,

11:03.621 --> 11:05.414
he's an ex military guy.

11:05.414 --> 11:06.874
He must've picked up some tricks from Iraq

11:06.874 --> 11:09.794
'cause he's got this formula.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.587
I don't know what he's splicing it with,

11:11.587 --> 11:14.006
but apparently, this shit,

11:14.006 --> 11:15.925
it fights cancer like a mother fucker.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.886
- [Ace] What's he using, Miracle Grow?

11:20.262 --> 11:22.640
- [Mr. Black] What do you
mean it fights cancer?

11:22.640 --> 11:24.684
- [Parker] Apparently the
entire medical industry

11:24.684 --> 11:25.935
is trying to cut a deal with him,

11:25.935 --> 11:28.938
but he won't do it 'cause of
some hippy-dippy bullshit.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.731
- [Mr. Black] How do I
know this ain't bullshit?

11:32.608 --> 11:33.567
- [Parker] That guy,

11:33.567 --> 11:36.070
the black guy, who always sits
at your high stakes table.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.489
His face is in all those magazines.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.324
Ask Ace. Ace, you know
who I'm talking about.

11:40.324 --> 11:41.534
- [Ace] I think he's talking
about Carter Winslow, boss.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.703
- [Mr. Black] I know who he's
talking about, thank you.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.454
- [Parker] Ask him if it's legit.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.081
I bet he tried to cut a deal himself.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.086
- [Mr. Black] Don't go anywhere.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.427
(phone ringing)

12:03.013 --> 12:05.891
Mr. Winslow, how are you, my friend?

12:05.891 --> 12:06.892
- [Carter] Caesar?

12:06.892 --> 12:08.936
- Heard you took me for a
ride on the tables tonight.

12:08.936 --> 12:09.895
(Carter laughing)

12:09.895 --> 12:11.147
That's okay.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.983
Usually finds its way
back one play or another.

12:13.983 --> 12:14.817
- [Carter] Yeah.

12:14.817 --> 12:15.651
- Listen my friend,

12:15.651 --> 12:16.485
I have a question for you.

12:16.485 --> 12:17.319
- [Carter] What's that?

12:17.319 --> 12:18.362
- Call it a hypothetical.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.781
(sexy music)

12:26.203 --> 12:27.997
- [Carter] You're talking
about the Paxton research,

12:27.997 --> 12:29.039
I know it.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.876
It might as well be a myth.

12:31.876 --> 12:35.713
Problem is the tribe wants
to sell. The chief doesn't.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.383
Seems like he's a man without a price.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.388
(ominous music)

12:50.186 --> 12:51.979
Attend me closely, Caesar.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.024
The one who gets me that formula,

12:56.108 --> 13:01.113
be it the chief, one of the
little Indians or somebody else,

13:01.781 --> 13:06.786
that person will be very,
very well compensated.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.664
- [Mr. Black] All right, we'll talk soon.

13:15.169 --> 13:18.380
All right kid, what am I gonna
find on granny's pot farm?

13:18.380 --> 13:19.256
What kind of security we talking about?

13:19.256 --> 13:20.633
- [Parker] Chain link fence.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.176
- [Mr. Black] Local PD?

13:22.176 --> 13:23.969
- [Parker] 30 miles away at best.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.473
- [Mr. Black] All right, Mr. Renfro,

13:27.473 --> 13:29.892
you got 48 hours to get
granny off that farm.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.685
Can you do that for me?

13:31.685 --> 13:33.979
- [Parker] Well, what
happens after 48 hours?

13:33.979 --> 13:35.439
- [Mr. Black] Cut him loose.

13:35.439 --> 13:37.399
- [Parker] What happens after 48 hours?

13:37.399 --> 13:38.359
(grunting)

13:40.444 --> 13:43.614
- [Tim] All right, I'm gonna
hit the john real quick.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.448
- [Jesse] Sure you are.

13:46.575 --> 13:47.409
- [Ernie] His formula?

13:49.745 --> 13:51.789
We've been working on
this for three years,

13:51.789 --> 13:54.875
we. Me, him, you...

13:54.875 --> 13:56.627
- [Red] You know what I mean.

13:56.627 --> 13:57.753
- [Ernie] Well it's too late anyway,

13:57.753 --> 13:58.838
the ball's already rolling.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.714
- [Red] We haven't
handed anything over yet.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.427
- [Jane] Ladies, what are we doing here?

14:05.427 --> 14:07.346
- [Dr. Altman] Now I know
that this is gonna sound

14:07.346 --> 14:08.556
just shy of deplorable,

14:08.556 --> 14:09.807
but you know it and I know it,

14:09.807 --> 14:11.934
that lovely, lovely woman back there

14:11.934 --> 14:13.936
should have been in the dirt months ago.

14:15.312 --> 14:17.314
Now before I go in there
and ask Mrs. Seeger

14:17.314 --> 14:20.359
why her hail Mary's are
different than the rest,

14:20.359 --> 14:23.195
maybe you can shed a little
light on what I saw earlier.

14:24.780 --> 14:28.617
- [Amanda] We're taking
miracle completely out of it?

14:28.617 --> 14:29.994
- [Dr. Altman] Not if by miracle

14:29.994 --> 14:32.454
you mean your husband's
marijuana research, no.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.792
Look Amanda, I know you mean to help

14:38.168 --> 14:40.337
and although I don't doubt
you're onto something here,

14:40.337 --> 14:42.339
you cannot give my patients weed.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.135
- [Amanda] It was a
concentrated CBD extract.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.887
- [Dr. Altman] It's not what I prescribed.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.847
- [Amanda] Then why
don't you prescribe it?

14:49.847 --> 14:52.016
Oh that's right because it's
not made by one of them.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.602
- [Dr. Altman] Excuse me?

14:54.602 --> 14:55.811
- [Amanda] I'm sorry,
that was out of line.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.354
- [Dr. Altman] No, you listen to me.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.900
There was a time that I
was young and naive too,

15:00.900 --> 15:02.067
and I had what I thought

15:02.067 --> 15:04.278
were good ideas and great intentions.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.323
But out here in the real world,

15:07.323 --> 15:10.075
we professional people have
to play along with these rules

15:10.075 --> 15:12.494
that were put in place
long before we were here.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.498
And until your CBD extract

15:16.498 --> 15:19.084
is packaged and labeled as a medicine,

15:20.044 --> 15:21.879
it's still weed, my dear.

15:24.965 --> 15:27.426
Now why don't you take
the rest of the afternoon

15:27.426 --> 15:29.470
and go and review your job requirements?

15:30.638 --> 15:32.348
- [Amanda] I don't think
that that'll be necessary.

15:32.348 --> 15:35.225
- [Dr. Altman] That is
not a suggestion, Amanda.

15:36.518 --> 15:38.479
(ominous music)

15:38.479 --> 15:40.064
- [Ernie] We weren't here yesterday.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.858
Jane's been the one drowning the plants.

15:42.858 --> 15:43.692
- [Jane] Yeah?

15:43.692 --> 15:45.194
How about you come water these plants

15:45.194 --> 15:47.780
and I'll make doodles on the clipboard?

15:47.780 --> 15:50.449
(ominous music)

15:57.456 --> 16:01.543
- [Sam] Hey. Any of you guys
seen the old lady at all today?

16:01.543 --> 16:02.711
Has she been floating around?

16:02.711 --> 16:04.213
- [Red] Are we supposed to?

16:04.213 --> 16:06.674
She always just stays in her room anyway.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.092
- [Ernie] That worthless grandson of her's

16:08.092 --> 16:09.677
ever stop by this week?

16:11.261 --> 16:13.180
- Yeah, yeah, he was here.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.224
His face was all bruised up actually.

16:17.685 --> 16:18.978
- [Ernie] You tell him to fuck off?

16:20.688 --> 16:23.357
(ominous music)

16:29.530 --> 16:32.783
- [Sam] Yeah, yeah, of course.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.452
(ominous music)

16:44.962 --> 16:47.881
(gunfire blasting)

16:49.216 --> 16:50.801
- [Jane] What the fuck?

16:50.801 --> 16:54.430
(gunfire blasting)
(dramatic music)

16:54.430 --> 16:56.056
- [Sam] Oh shit. Hey! Get down.

16:56.056 --> 17:00.853
(gunfire blasting)
(dramatic music)

17:00.853 --> 17:03.439
(ears ringing)

17:13.656 --> 17:15.742
- [Ace] Eye in the sky,
how we looking? over.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.625
(phone ringing)

17:24.960 --> 17:27.963
(breathing heavily)

17:28.881 --> 17:31.550
(phone ringing)

17:39.600 --> 17:42.895
- [Sam] Yean Amanda, I got
to call you back, all right?

17:42.895 --> 17:44.772
- [Sniper] Hello Sam.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.231
- [Sam] Who the fuck is this?

17:46.231 --> 17:47.399
- [Sniper] There will
be time for that later.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.068
Right now, I need you to listen.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.069
- [Sam] Are you the mother fucker

17:50.069 --> 17:50.986
that just killed my entire team?

17:52.613 --> 17:54.698
- [Sniper] I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.368
- [Sam] Listen to me, mother fucker,

17:58.368 --> 17:59.411
I don't know what kind of sick joke

17:59.411 --> 18:00.537
you're fucking playing here.

18:00.537 --> 18:01.830
(laughing)

18:01.830 --> 18:02.873
- [Sniper] Oh you must mean the joke

18:02.873 --> 18:04.666
about keeping you alive.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.335
(dramatic music)

18:06.335 --> 18:09.046
it's gonna be in your best
interest to listen to me.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.215
- [Sam] I'm not playing
your game, mother fucker.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.049
Cops? They're on the way.

18:13.842 --> 18:14.676
(gunfire)

18:14.676 --> 18:16.678
(exploding)

18:17.930 --> 18:18.764
Damn it.

18:19.932 --> 18:20.766
Fuck!

18:21.975 --> 18:23.143
Piece of shit.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.106
Fuck.

18:27.106 --> 18:30.234
(phone ringing)

18:30.234 --> 18:31.193
What?

18:31.193 --> 18:32.027
- [Sniper] Game?

18:32.027 --> 18:33.237
No, this is not a game, Sam.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.196
But we do have a clock.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.405
And right now, that clock

18:35.405 --> 18:36.240
is ticking.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.074
- [Sam] Listen to me,

18:37.074 --> 18:38.200
you twisted son of a bitch.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.993
Whatever it is that you want,

18:39.993 --> 18:41.036
whoever it is you want,

18:41.036 --> 18:43.664
I am not your guy.

18:43.664 --> 18:46.250
- [Sniper] Well as we speak a black SUV

18:46.250 --> 18:48.001
is heading right for you.

18:48.001 --> 18:51.922
And yes, the heavily armed
men inside will kill you

18:51.922 --> 18:53.799
when they see that you are still alive.

18:53.799 --> 18:54.633
- [Sam] Fuck.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.467
- [Sniper] Don't believe me?

18:55.467 --> 18:57.469
Take a peek outside.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.139
(ominous music)

19:03.058 --> 19:03.892
Hey, welcome back, Sam.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.936
- [Sam] Why is there a truck
heading down my driveway?

19:05.936 --> 19:07.187
- [Sniper] You're not
gonna want to stick around

19:07.187 --> 19:08.605
to find out.

19:08.605 --> 19:10.440
- [Sam] Look man, I don't
know who you think I am

19:10.440 --> 19:12.526
or what it is that you think I have.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.611
- [Sniper] Your special formula.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.989
You grow weed that drastically
reduces cancer cells

19:16.989 --> 19:19.074
and you think you can keep that a secret?

19:25.873 --> 19:29.334
Get that formula and get
to the other greenhouse.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.966
- [Tim] Who do we have here?

19:38.051 --> 19:39.303
What the fuck?

19:40.929 --> 19:42.347
(sniffing drugs)

19:42.347 --> 19:45.017
(ominous music)

19:48.896 --> 19:51.648
Who the hell are these clowns?

19:51.648 --> 19:53.108
- [Sniper] I said the greenhouse.

19:53.108 --> 19:55.152
Does this look like a
fucking greenhouse to you?

19:55.152 --> 19:57.821
(ominous music)

20:18.508 --> 20:19.885
- [Ace] We got a problem in here.

20:28.810 --> 20:31.146
Our friend ain't in here, boss

20:31.146 --> 20:33.565
and I don't see no formula either.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.235
(ominous music)

20:42.199 --> 20:44.910
(sniffing)

20:44.910 --> 20:46.536
- [Mr. Black] Well hello gorgeous.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.636
Gentlemen still lurking

21:02.636 --> 21:07.307
about this shit hole you
call a ranch. Good afternoon.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.018
My name's Mr. Black.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.353
- [Tim] Where'd they put it?

21:12.437 --> 21:13.730
Ah, where'd they put it?

21:19.152 --> 21:20.570
- [Mr. Black] Now I understand that my

21:20.570 --> 21:23.156
killing all your friends

21:23.156 --> 21:26.660
and well, planning to kill you too

21:26.660 --> 21:30.831
makes it hard for you to trust
what I'm about to say next,

21:34.001 --> 21:35.836
but I give you my word as a man

21:38.297 --> 21:41.383
that if you come forth with what I want,

21:41.383 --> 21:42.801
I will let you walk away

21:42.801 --> 21:43.635
from what I'm assuming

21:43.635 --> 21:46.763
has gotta be the worst
fucking day of your lives.

21:46.763 --> 21:49.433
(ominous music)

21:52.644 --> 21:57.441
However, if you do not
come out and we find you,

21:57.441 --> 22:00.068
once again I give you my word

22:00.068 --> 22:01.486
that you'll wish you would have fallen

22:01.486 --> 22:03.280
with your comrades back there.

22:04.823 --> 22:07.909
Gentlemen, you have one fucking minute.

22:08.785 --> 22:10.287
- [Sniper] Stay low,

22:10.287 --> 22:11.455
get deeper into the room.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.749
- [Sam] How's this guy fucking seeing me?

22:14.833 --> 22:17.502
(ominous music)

22:33.602 --> 22:36.355
(glass breaking)

22:38.315 --> 22:40.984
(ominous music)

23:06.635 --> 23:09.137
- [Sniper] All right, looks
like you have some company.

23:09.137 --> 23:10.097
- Shit.

23:10.097 --> 23:12.766
(ominous music)

24:06.486 --> 24:08.822
(Gunshot)

24:13.118 --> 24:15.245
(grunting)

24:15.245 --> 24:16.413
(laughing)

24:16.413 --> 24:17.664
- [Mr. Black] Who do we have here?

24:17.664 --> 24:19.291
- [Ace] Found him on the john.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.460
Almost blew his own God damn head off.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.878
- [Mr. Black] That was you?

24:22.878 --> 24:24.212
- [Ace] It was a terrible shot.

24:24.212 --> 24:25.755
- [Vice] Miller, you seeing anything?

24:27.841 --> 24:29.342
- [Miller] Not a fucking thing.

24:31.553 --> 24:32.888
- [Vice] He's not in here.

24:32.888 --> 24:33.722
Let's move.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.145
- [Tim] Look, you got
the wrong guy, all right?

24:40.145 --> 24:42.063
I don't know anything, I just work here.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.982
- [Sam] Fucking Tim.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.484
- [Tim] Seriously, you got to believe me.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.443
- [Sam] Shit.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.700
- [Mr. Black] Now why is
it people always say that?

24:53.700 --> 24:54.534
- [Ace] Beats me.

24:54.534 --> 24:55.785
- [Mr. Black] I don't know anything.

24:55.785 --> 24:58.455
Please don't kill my
entire lineage, Mr. Black.

24:58.455 --> 24:59.748
You got the wrong guy.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.877
Son, yo, eyes on me.

25:04.753 --> 25:05.962
This next part's very important.

25:05.962 --> 25:08.298
I need your undivided attention.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.717
The only thing keeping you
alive is what you know.

25:10.717 --> 25:13.470
So for your own sake,
don't sell yourself short.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.181
You clear the rest of the house?

25:16.181 --> 25:17.182
- [Ace] Empty sir.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.606
- [Sam] Hey, this is
Sam, you know what to do.

25:24.606 --> 25:25.649
(beeping)

25:25.649 --> 25:27.526
- [Amanda] Sam, it's me, call me back.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.445
(ominous music)

25:31.988 --> 25:32.989
(gasping)

25:32.989 --> 25:35.158
(yelling)

25:39.746 --> 25:42.499
(dramatic music)

25:53.969 --> 25:56.972
- [Mr. Black] Okay. So
who's our lucky contestant?

25:59.015 --> 26:00.016
I take it you haven't been

26:00.016 --> 26:01.893
in many situations like this before.

26:01.893 --> 26:02.852
- [Ace] I'mma guess not.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.272
- [Mr. Black] No?

26:05.272 --> 26:06.106
Course not.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.735
- [Sniper] I do not remember
telling you to move.

26:10.735 --> 26:11.570
- [Sam] Oh yeah?

26:12.821 --> 26:14.114
You gonna shoot me?

26:14.114 --> 26:15.323
(laughing)

26:15.323 --> 26:17.909
- [Sniper] What makes you think I won't?

26:18.785 --> 26:20.495
- [Sam] Nah, if you were gonna shoot me,

26:20.495 --> 26:21.871
you'd have done it already.

26:23.456 --> 26:25.917
Nah, my guess is this piece
of paper in my pocket's

26:25.917 --> 26:28.211
got some value to you, pal.

26:28.211 --> 26:30.297
- [Sniper] Oh, he thinks he's clever.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.173
- [Sam] Oh yeah, well, you
don't gotta be Sherlock Holmes

26:32.173 --> 26:34.384
to figure out that you're keeping me alive

26:34.384 --> 26:36.720
so you can double cross your boss.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.347
- [Sniper] Double cross, is
that what you think this is?

26:39.347 --> 26:41.891
- Yeah, well I doubt Mr.
Whatever the fuck his name is

26:41.891 --> 26:43.685
is here to play find the pot farmer.

26:46.062 --> 26:47.856
- [Mr. Black] Let's try something.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.232
You like movies kid?

26:49.232 --> 26:50.567
- [Ace] I love when he does this.

26:52.694 --> 26:53.778
- [Tim] I like "Toy Story".

26:53.778 --> 26:56.031
(laughing)

27:02.454 --> 27:03.788
- [Mr. Black] No.
- [Ace] No.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.457
- [Mr. Black] Not quite.
- [Ace] Not at all.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.417
- [Mr. Black] I was
thinking more like "Casino."

27:07.417 --> 27:08.752
You ever see that picture?

27:08.752 --> 27:11.338
- [Tim] Yeah, it's a classic.

27:12.422 --> 27:13.882
- [Mr. Black] Kid's got good taste, Ace.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.134
- [Ace] Damn good taste, boss.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.677
- [Mr. Black] You remember
that scene where Pesci

27:17.677 --> 27:20.221
has that poor fuck's head in the vice?

27:20.221 --> 27:22.265
(laughing)

27:22.265 --> 27:23.099
Of course you do.

27:23.099 --> 27:26.436
Personally, my favorite fucking
scene in the whole movie.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.313
Now the mick with his head in the vice,

27:28.313 --> 27:29.981
who was he trying to protect?

27:29.981 --> 27:31.066
You remember the name?

27:34.486 --> 27:35.320
Ace, you remember the name?

27:35.320 --> 27:37.405
- [Ace] Yeah, it was Charlie something.

27:37.405 --> 27:38.239
- [Tim] It was M.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.158
- [Mr. Black] What was that?

27:40.158 --> 27:41.534
- [Ace] You say something boy?

27:41.534 --> 27:42.952
- [Tim] It was Charlie M.

27:42.952 --> 27:43.912
- [Mr. Black] Charlie M!

27:43.912 --> 27:45.163
- [Ace] It was Charlie M.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.915
- [Mr. Black] I love that scene.

27:46.915 --> 27:50.210
Now don't be stupid by trying
to protect any Charlie M's

27:50.210 --> 27:51.336
'cause at the end of the day,

27:51.336 --> 27:54.464
did the mick's eye getting
popped in his fucking head

27:54.464 --> 27:55.840
protect Charlie M?

27:57.092 --> 27:58.218
- [Tim] I don't know.

27:59.177 --> 28:00.887
They didn't put that in the movie.

28:02.097 --> 28:05.183
- [Mr. Black] Son, I can
assure you it did not.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.143
So now, let's start with your name.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.649
- [Tim] Timothy.

28:12.649 --> 28:13.692
- Okay Timothy,

28:13.692 --> 28:15.610
at this point I'm sure
you probably assumed

28:15.610 --> 28:17.821
that most of your buddies are dead.

28:17.821 --> 28:21.616
- [Ace] Dead and gone, dead and gone.

28:21.616 --> 28:22.867
- [Tim] Why are you doing this?

28:23.743 --> 28:26.246
- [Mr. Black] Look at Timmy
boy asking the questions.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.039
One second he's not talking

28:28.039 --> 28:29.499
and the next he's asking questions.

28:29.499 --> 28:32.001
- [Ace] Say boss don't they
have a word for that in Yiddish?

28:32.001 --> 28:34.045
- [Mr. Black] Yeah, they do.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.296
It's called having chutzpah.

28:35.296 --> 28:37.716
- [Ace] Chutzpah, that's
what it was, it was chutzpah.

28:38.925 --> 28:41.886
Hey boys, let's get those
bodies out of that greenhouse.

28:42.929 --> 28:44.764
- [Mr. Black] Timmy boy,
we're gonna get your dead

28:44.764 --> 28:46.141
cronies out here,

28:46.141 --> 28:48.643
but I'm not gonna lie
to you, it's not pretty.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.938
But I need you to focus

28:51.938 --> 28:54.441
because the faster you identify them,

28:54.441 --> 28:56.651
the quicker we get to figure out

28:56.651 --> 28:58.862
who is trying to be a fucking hero

29:00.363 --> 29:03.324
and the faster we get to put
an end to this dreadful day.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.369
You think you can do that, Timmy boy?

29:11.416 --> 29:12.250
- [Sam] Fuck.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.254
- [Sniper] All right
Sam, you still with me?

29:16.254 --> 29:18.590
- [Sam] No, I went out for
a fucking cup of coffee.

29:20.467 --> 29:22.177
- [Sniper] I'm assuming
you have some protection

29:22.177 --> 29:23.261
stashed on that ranch.

29:26.097 --> 29:26.931
- [Sam] Yeah.

29:30.935 --> 29:33.313
Okay, where are you prick?

29:34.230 --> 29:35.273
- [Sniper] Hey, Mr. Paxton?-

29:35.273 --> 29:36.316
- [Sam] Fuck.

29:38.151 --> 29:41.738
All right, there's a shotgun in the house.

29:41.738 --> 29:42.697
- [Sniper] That would work.

29:42.697 --> 29:43.531
Unfortunately for you,

29:43.531 --> 29:45.241
your buddy outside ruined that option.

29:45.241 --> 29:47.076
- [Sam] The old lady,

29:47.076 --> 29:50.497
she's got a revolver behind the TV.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.873
- [Sniper] You're ex-military

29:51.873 --> 29:53.750
and all you keep is a
revolver and a shotgun

29:53.750 --> 29:55.210
on your pot farm?

29:55.210 --> 29:56.544
- [Sam] Yeah, well we never had to deal

29:56.544 --> 29:59.464
with a fucking hostage situation
before you demented fuck.

30:00.715 --> 30:03.593
And wait a second. How'd you
know I was in the military?

30:03.593 --> 30:05.220
- [Sniper] We need to
get you in that house

30:05.220 --> 30:07.430
and we need to get you that gun.

30:07.430 --> 30:08.598
- [Sam] And the men with the AR-15s?

30:08.598 --> 30:11.267
- [Sniper] Sam, it's like I've
been telling you all along,

30:11.267 --> 30:12.894
you're gonna need to trust me.

30:12.894 --> 30:13.895
- [Sam] Right.

30:13.895 --> 30:16.564
(ominous music)

30:21.402 --> 30:22.237
- [Ace] Thank you, fellas.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.196
Now do be so kind

30:23.196 --> 30:25.532
as to find us our last remaining amigo.

30:28.743 --> 30:32.080
- [Tim] And that's Jane. Was Jane.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.665
- [Ace] What was that boy?

30:33.665 --> 30:36.167
- [Mr. Black] Easy Ace, our
boy here is having a rough day.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.710
- [Ace] My apologies, sir.

30:38.711 --> 30:39.838
- [Sniper] Go Sam, now.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.757
- [Mr. Black] So if you're Timothy,

30:43.842 --> 30:46.469
that leaves our remaining mystery man

30:46.469 --> 30:47.554
to be Sam Paxton.

30:49.055 --> 30:51.850
And your boss, Mr. Sam Paxton,

30:53.101 --> 30:54.769
for lack of a better word,

30:54.769 --> 30:56.646
has concocted this specific formula

30:58.690 --> 31:00.191
for growing cannabis.

31:00.191 --> 31:02.944
(dramatic music)

31:08.116 --> 31:12.871
Where might I find this
special formula, Timmy boy?

31:15.456 --> 31:17.083
- [Tim] So you're telling
me you killed all these

31:17.083 --> 31:18.167
fucking people

31:18.167 --> 31:19.711
over a weed formula?

31:22.005 --> 31:24.674
(ominous music)

31:35.143 --> 31:37.562
Look, the only formula that I know about

31:37.562 --> 31:39.689
is in the lock box
underneath the work bench

31:39.689 --> 31:43.484
in the greenhouse that you redecorated.

31:43.484 --> 31:44.903
- [Mr. Black] Really?

31:44.903 --> 31:46.237
- [Ace] One lockbox coming in.

31:47.530 --> 31:48.489
- [Mr. Black] This lockbox?

31:50.158 --> 31:51.200
Hmm.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.870
(ominous music)

31:56.039 --> 31:56.873
- [Sniper] And hold.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.542
(ominous music)

32:19.187 --> 32:20.688
The house go, now.

32:22.023 --> 32:24.233
- [Mr. Black] If you can't
help me locate this formula,

32:25.485 --> 32:27.362
the only use I have for you alive

32:28.571 --> 32:31.032
is in the finding of this fucking guy.

32:31.991 --> 32:34.661
(ominous music)

32:36.955 --> 32:38.581
- [Sniper] Run Sam.

32:38.581 --> 32:41.250
(ominous music)

32:50.343 --> 32:52.387
Okay, you're alone in there for now.

32:52.387 --> 32:54.097
Let's get to that gun.

32:56.516 --> 32:59.185
(ominous music)

33:08.653 --> 33:11.781
- [Sam] So is your
grandmother always here?

33:11.781 --> 33:12.740
- [Parker] Always in her room.

33:12.740 --> 33:15.034
She got dementia and a
whole bunch of other shit.

33:15.034 --> 33:17.328
Honestly, I'm surprised
she's still kicking it.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.499
So what makes you guys think
you're gonna be any different

33:21.499 --> 33:23.793
from the rest of the
weed growers out there?

33:23.793 --> 33:25.378
- [Jimmy] Well, let's just
say we plan on growing

33:25.378 --> 33:27.005
a little faster than the rest of them.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.589
- [Parker] How?

33:28.589 --> 33:30.883
Put a little cocaine in the soil?

33:30.883 --> 33:32.510
Trick you picked up in Iraqistan?

33:34.929 --> 33:38.016
- [Sam] Actually, we're
experimenting with infusing the weed

33:38.016 --> 33:38.850
with niac-

33:38.850 --> 33:41.686
- [Parker] Cutting, splicing,
whatever, I don't really care.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.521
The point is you need my land to do

33:43.521 --> 33:44.647
whatever it is you got to do.

33:44.647 --> 33:48.568
- [Jimmy] Your grandmother's
land... and it's Iraq.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.903
And we served in Afghanistan.

33:50.903 --> 33:52.613
- [Parker] Iraq, Afghanistan,
it's all the same shit,

33:52.613 --> 33:54.449
it's the Middle East.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.451
- [Sam] Look man, we got some other places

33:56.451 --> 33:57.285
that we want to look at.

33:57.285 --> 34:00.872
The truth is we like your
spot because it's secluded.

34:00.872 --> 34:01.998
- [Parker] You want to be as far away

34:01.998 --> 34:04.042
from the police as possible, just say it.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.378
I hate it out here.

34:07.378 --> 34:09.797
Nobody likes it out here
except for my grandpa.

34:09.797 --> 34:10.797
- [Jimmy] You don't say.

34:12.257 --> 34:14.469
- [Parker] He was the one
who decided to move out here.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.763
He was one of you guys, 'nam.

34:18.431 --> 34:20.933
But he was a bit of a quack

34:20.933 --> 34:22.726
so he moved out here with my grandma...

34:23.770 --> 34:24.687
He's dead now.

34:25.646 --> 34:28.190
Honestly, I'm gonna sell
this place the second she uh,

34:28.190 --> 34:29.108
you know.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.234
- [Jimmy] Is this guy fucking serious?

34:30.234 --> 34:31.069
- [Parker] Yeah, I am serious.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.152
You've got a problem with that?

34:32.152 --> 34:33.362
- [Jimmy] A little bit.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.114
- [Sam] Hey, hey, hey, hey.

34:36.616 --> 34:37.449
It's no problem.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.661
- [Parker] So we got a deal?

34:40.661 --> 34:43.246
You guys set up shop on my land

34:43.246 --> 34:48.168
and I get 20% of your
yield or no, no, it's 25%

34:48.168 --> 34:50.213
'cause I assume you guys aren't licensed.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.966
- [Jimmy] Fuck no, I'm not
partnering with this guy.

34:53.966 --> 34:56.052
- [Sam] Jimmy, wait.
- [Jimmy] No.

34:56.052 --> 34:57.595
- [Sam] Just give me one second okay?

34:59.138 --> 34:59.972
Jimmy!

35:00.973 --> 35:01.974
Jimmy, Jimmy!

35:06.979 --> 35:08.022
Hey Jimmy, come on,

35:08.022 --> 35:09.607
hey, come on hey.

35:09.607 --> 35:10.691
Hey, hey hold up, hold up.

35:10.691 --> 35:11.526
- [Jimmy] What?

35:11.526 --> 35:12.527
- [Sam] Wait.

35:12.527 --> 35:13.945
- [Jimmy] I'm not
partnering with that fuck.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.280
- [Sam] Look, we can negotiate with him.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.323
- [Jimmy] Fuck that.

35:17.323 --> 35:18.533
That guy's a scumbag.

35:18.533 --> 35:19.992
Let's go find somewhere else.

35:21.744 --> 35:22.745
- [Sam] There is nowhere else.

35:22.745 --> 35:25.706
No one's gonna take us
without licenses and rent.

35:25.706 --> 35:28.668
That's why we need a place
that's under the radar.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.002
What, what?

35:30.002 --> 35:32.213
- [Jimmy] I'm sorry, you're
not seeing this clearly.

35:32.213 --> 35:33.840
- [Sam] Oh, come on, don't
give me that bullshit, bro.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.049
- [Jimmy] Sam there's no under the radar

35:35.049 --> 35:37.051
when you have a partner you can't trust.

35:42.056 --> 35:44.517
Look, your mom's gone.

35:46.269 --> 35:48.271
Rushing this isn't gonna bring her back.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.983
- [Sam] That's not what this is about.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.359
- [Jimmy] No?

35:53.359 --> 35:55.653
If that's the case, then let's go.

36:00.449 --> 36:03.286
(ominous music)

36:03.286 --> 36:04.287
Wrong choice.

36:07.832 --> 36:09.876
Look me up when you realize it.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.211
(sad music)

36:22.763 --> 36:24.891
- [Parker] So I take it we have a deal?

36:24.891 --> 36:27.560
(ominous music)

36:39.405 --> 36:40.615
- [Sniper] Sam although I can't see

36:40.615 --> 36:41.908
that beautiful face of yours,

36:41.908 --> 36:43.618
I can see that you're not moving.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.411
- [Sam] Yeah, I'm moving, I'm moving.

36:48.581 --> 36:50.249
- [Tim] All right, Mr. Black,

36:54.545 --> 36:57.673
I've been working on this
farm for about six months now.

36:57.673 --> 36:59.300
If it's the weed you want...

36:59.300 --> 37:01.219
I know how to grow it.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.512
I got your formula in my head.

37:03.512 --> 37:08.017
Could've done without the
mass killing, genocide you

37:09.393 --> 37:11.145
brought upon our land here.

37:11.145 --> 37:12.104
(laughing)

37:13.940 --> 37:18.194
But you know, a couple body bags,

37:18.194 --> 37:19.820
little bit of bleach,

37:19.820 --> 37:22.198
no one's the wiser.

37:22.198 --> 37:24.450
(laughing)

37:24.450 --> 37:26.160
- [Mr. Black] You're a
regular riot Timmy, boy.

37:26.160 --> 37:26.994
- [Ace] Funny kid.

37:27.870 --> 37:29.372
- [Mr. Black] I think
he's fucking serious, Ace.

37:29.372 --> 37:31.207
Why don't you knock some sense into him,

37:31.207 --> 37:32.041
will ya please?

37:32.041 --> 37:33.167
- [Ace] Thought you'd never ask, boss.

37:33.167 --> 37:34.543
- [Tim] Stay away from
me you fucking creep-

37:34.543 --> 37:36.796
(grunting)

37:37.672 --> 37:39.507
- [Sam] So where did you serve?

37:39.507 --> 37:41.217
- [Sniper] What was that?

37:41.217 --> 37:42.551
- [Sam] Well you're Army, right?

37:42.551 --> 37:43.511
(laughing)

37:43.511 --> 37:45.388
- [Sniper] You know? I admire the effort

37:45.388 --> 37:46.222
to turn the tables, Sam,

37:46.222 --> 37:48.808
but that is gonna be a real non-starter.

37:52.561 --> 37:54.021
- [Sam] Oh shit, where is she?

37:54.021 --> 37:55.815
- [Sniper] The gun, Sam.

37:55.815 --> 37:57.275
- [Sam] No, no, she's always in here.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.026
- [Sniper] She, who?

37:59.026 --> 38:00.486
- [Sam] Fucking Parker.

38:01.821 --> 38:04.490
(ominous music)

38:07.076 --> 38:09.328
- [Grandma] How long do I
have to stay here again?

38:09.328 --> 38:10.329
I don't like your place.

38:10.329 --> 38:11.205
It smells funny.

38:11.205 --> 38:12.498
- [Parker] Just a few more days, grandma.

38:12.498 --> 38:13.499
They're fumigating the farm.

38:13.499 --> 38:15.084
I told you last week, remember?

38:16.377 --> 38:17.628
- [Grandma] Well all right.

38:21.215 --> 38:22.425
- [Parker] Look grandma,
I got to run for a bit.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.343
Are you okay to stay here by yourself?

38:25.303 --> 38:26.429
- [Grandma] Do you like
people talking to you

38:26.429 --> 38:27.805
when you're in the bathroom?

38:28.973 --> 38:30.349
- [Parker] I gotta run, I'll be back.

38:31.851 --> 38:34.603
(spitting blood)

38:36.439 --> 38:37.815
- [Tim] So who is it?

38:39.567 --> 38:41.736
- [Mr. Black] Jesus Christ,
what is it with this kid?

38:41.736 --> 38:42.570
Who's who?

38:45.489 --> 38:46.532
- [Tim] Who's sick?

38:47.950 --> 38:49.243
- [Mr. Black] Fuck you talking about?

38:50.661 --> 38:51.787
- [Tim] Is it your kid?

38:56.042 --> 38:57.585
Is it your baby girl?

38:58.544 --> 38:59.462
- [Mr. Black] Hey baby doll.

39:03.507 --> 39:05.676
(snoring)

39:07.219 --> 39:10.389
- [Tim] Is it Mrs. Black?

39:12.141 --> 39:14.226
(crying)

39:24.153 --> 39:25.321
- [Mr. Black] Are you gonna
shut him the fuck up already?

39:25.321 --> 39:26.155
- [Ace] Yes, sir.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.785
- [Tim] Look, fists are
fine, you don't need a knife.

39:30.785 --> 39:31.619
- [Ace] Shhh.

39:35.748 --> 39:39.335
- [Mr. Black] We're gonna
roll on plan B boys, over.

39:39.335 --> 39:42.004
(ominous music)

39:56.185 --> 39:58.187
- [Sniper] Okay, it's party time.

39:58.187 --> 40:00.314
You have a mark in the house with you.

40:00.314 --> 40:02.983
(ominous music)

40:19.333 --> 40:20.334
If you're gonna take one out,

40:20.334 --> 40:22.253
now's your chance.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.922
(ominous music)

40:26.799 --> 40:27.883
- [Mr. Black] Yo, Mr. Paxton,

40:29.468 --> 40:32.012
that's your boy Timothy
squealing out here.

40:33.514 --> 40:35.057
Unless you want me to chop him up

40:35.057 --> 40:37.393
into nice even eight ounce packages,

40:37.393 --> 40:39.812
I suggest you come outside and play.

40:40.896 --> 40:43.649
(dramatic music)

40:46.610 --> 40:48.320
(gunfire blasting)

40:48.320 --> 40:49.780
He's in there, go find him.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.703
(laughing)

40:55.703 --> 40:57.580
Fucking amateur hour here, Timmy boy.

40:58.998 --> 41:00.958
I'm really scraping the bottom
of the barrels these days,

41:00.958 --> 41:01.792
aren't I?

41:02.668 --> 41:05.421
(dramatic music)

41:06.380 --> 41:08.632
(grunting)

41:15.890 --> 41:18.976
- [Sniper] Midnight cowboy
coming in at your six.

41:41.165 --> 41:43.709
- [Ace] Yeah. Vice is down. Over.

41:45.085 --> 41:47.421
(ominous music)

41:47.421 --> 41:49.798
- [Mr. Black] You know I'm
usually not one for this stuff,

41:49.798 --> 41:50.925
but I gotta say,

41:50.925 --> 41:52.885
you guys do a damn good job.

41:55.763 --> 41:58.265
- [Sniper] Take it easy now, Sam.

41:58.265 --> 41:59.767
I know what you're thinking, don't do it.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.185
- [Sam] The hell I'm not.

42:01.185 --> 42:02.728
- [Sniper] You need Black alive.

42:02.728 --> 42:04.897
(Tim yelling)

42:04.897 --> 42:06.565
Once again, a little trust

42:06.565 --> 42:07.399
is gonna go a long way.

42:07.399 --> 42:09.193
- [Sam] Yeah, shoot me.

42:10.778 --> 42:13.405
- [Sniper] He has Amanda.

42:13.405 --> 42:17.243
- [Sam] Fuck did you just say?

42:17.243 --> 42:22.248
Hey, hey cocksucker, how
do you know that name?

42:26.585 --> 42:30.422
How the fuck do you know that name?

42:30.422 --> 42:34.009
- [Sniper] I missed the
part where that matters.

42:39.807 --> 42:40.891
- [Sam] Fuck.

42:40.891 --> 42:43.018
- [Sniper] If you go on a rampage now,

42:43.018 --> 42:45.354
even if you manage to take out Black,

42:45.354 --> 42:47.982
you'll never see your wife again.

42:47.982 --> 42:50.192
- [Sam] Fuck you.

42:50.192 --> 42:52.111
- [Sniper] You said that already.

42:52.111 --> 42:54.071
- [Sam] Yeah, did I say this?

42:54.071 --> 42:55.739
If I were you, I'd shoot me

42:56.740 --> 42:59.243
because whoever the fuck you are,

42:59.243 --> 43:00.286
when I find you,

43:00.286 --> 43:03.289
and I will find you,

43:03.289 --> 43:06.667
you'll be lucky if all I do is kill you,

43:06.667 --> 43:08.210
you fucking piece of shit.

43:09.128 --> 43:12.131
(breathing heavily)

43:18.929 --> 43:21.932
(upbeat rock music)

43:43.078 --> 43:45.789
(ominous music)

43:52.087 --> 43:54.465
(phone ringing)

43:54.465 --> 43:55.966
- [Sam] Mother fucker.

43:55.966 --> 43:58.927
- [Sniper] Come on, pick
up the fucking phone, Sam.

43:58.927 --> 44:00.262
- [Sam] Not today, mother fucker.

44:01.722 --> 44:04.391
(ominous music)

44:06.352 --> 44:09.396
- [Mr. Black] Fuck does this
schmuck think he's doing?

44:09.396 --> 44:12.066
(ominous music)

44:13.484 --> 44:14.318
Come to join the party?

44:14.318 --> 44:15.444
- [Parker] What is this?

44:15.444 --> 44:17.529
You were supposed to be
out of here hours ago.

44:18.864 --> 44:19.782
Holy shit.

44:20.658 --> 44:21.700
Are they all dead?

44:23.702 --> 44:25.245
- [Ace] Hell's the maggot doing here?

44:25.245 --> 44:26.789
- [Mr. Black] Came to see the show.

44:26.789 --> 44:28.499
Find him a front row seat. Will ya, pal?

44:28.499 --> 44:30.042
- [Ace] My pleasure.

44:30.042 --> 44:33.712
- [Parker] Whoa, this wasn't part
of the plan. This wasn't part of
the- - [Ace] You done fucked up.

44:33.712 --> 44:36.006
- [Ace] You lied to us.
You know you lied to us?

44:36.006 --> 44:36.840
- [Parker] Okay. Easy

44:36.840 --> 44:39.426
(ominous music)

44:43.889 --> 44:44.932
- [Ace] Sit down, shut up.

44:44.932 --> 44:47.017
- [Parker] I owed you 100
grand, this is insane.

44:47.017 --> 44:49.520
(muffled speaking)

44:49.520 --> 44:51.438
- [Mr. Black] You forgot to
tell us that your mad scientist

44:51.438 --> 44:53.732
watched "Rambo" one too many times.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.779
- [Ace] Eye in the sky, how's it looking?

44:58.779 --> 45:01.073
- [Sniper] He's a fucking ghost.

45:01.073 --> 45:02.324
- [Mr. Black ] This
little charade has gone on

45:02.324 --> 45:04.451
way further than my patience will allow.

45:08.205 --> 45:12.000
Yo, Sam, I didn't want to
have to kill anyone else

45:12.000 --> 45:13.627
but as far as I'm concerned,

45:14.545 --> 45:17.131
this next one's on fucking you.

45:17.131 --> 45:20.592
(ominous music)

45:20.592 --> 45:22.970
Come out now, Sam, or
Timmy boy here gets it.

45:28.475 --> 45:32.438
I mean it, Sam, five
seconds or your boy gets it.

45:32.438 --> 45:37.401
Four, three, two.

45:37.401 --> 45:39.069
(grunting)

45:39.069 --> 45:39.903
One-

45:39.903 --> 45:41.321
- [Ace] That's him.

45:41.321 --> 45:44.074
(dramatic music)

46:15.481 --> 46:17.733
(grunting)

46:21.361 --> 46:22.654
Imma get you, boy.

46:22.654 --> 46:25.491
(dramatic music)

46:27.326 --> 46:28.535
- [Sniper] No, Sam, no!

46:30.329 --> 46:31.413
- [Ace] Give it up Sam.

46:32.623 --> 46:36.001
(dramatic music)

46:36.001 --> 46:38.253
(grunting)

46:50.307 --> 46:52.017
(gunfire blasting)

46:52.017 --> 46:54.770
(ominous music)

46:58.398 --> 47:00.818
- [Mr. Black] Fuck's going on out there?

47:02.611 --> 47:03.445
- [Ace] You might want someone

47:03.445 --> 47:04.947
to take a look at that leg of yours.

47:04.947 --> 47:08.367
(ominous music)

47:08.367 --> 47:09.201
- [Mr. Black] Reel him in, Ace,

47:09.201 --> 47:10.786
family's all here now.

47:11.662 --> 47:14.665
(mysterious music)

47:58.041 --> 47:59.376
- [Amanda] Sam.

47:59.376 --> 48:01.461
- [Sam] Amanda.

48:01.461 --> 48:04.381
(mysterious music)

48:11.096 --> 48:11.930
- [Amanda] Sam.

48:14.516 --> 48:17.269
(ominous music)

48:23.859 --> 48:25.319
Sam.

48:25.319 --> 48:27.988
(ominous music)

48:47.341 --> 48:48.175
Sam.

48:49.718 --> 48:52.387
(ominous music)

48:56.934 --> 48:58.185
- [Mr. Black] Sam.

49:01.104 --> 49:01.939
- [Amanda] Sam.
- [Mr. Black] Sam.

49:10.030 --> 49:10.864
- Sam?

49:12.658 --> 49:14.368
Come on, Sam.

49:14.368 --> 49:16.370
Wake up, little boy.

49:16.370 --> 49:18.330
Sleepy time's over.

49:18.330 --> 49:19.706
Yo Mr. Paxton,

49:20.958 --> 49:22.250
Come on, Sam,

49:22.250 --> 49:24.836
don't make me have to
start chopping limbs here.

49:24.836 --> 49:25.837
There he is.

49:27.339 --> 49:29.716
The man of the hour
has officially arrived.

49:31.677 --> 49:33.553
Let me just tell you
how good it is Sammy boy

49:33.553 --> 49:35.389
to finally fucking meet you.

49:36.515 --> 49:37.349
Look who's here.

49:38.475 --> 49:40.185
- [Sam] Baby, don't worry,

49:40.185 --> 49:41.728
I'm gonna get us out of here.
[Mr. Black] Look at these two.

49:41.728 --> 49:42.813
- [Sam] Okay?

49:42.813 --> 49:45.649
(ominous music)

49:46.817 --> 49:48.068
- [Sam] Trust me.
- [Mr. Black] All right,

49:48.068 --> 49:49.611
enough of the reunion.

49:49.611 --> 49:50.445
- [Sam] Fuck you.

49:50.445 --> 49:51.405
- [Mr. Black] Fuck me?

49:51.405 --> 49:53.073
- [Ace] Woo, that's my boy.

49:54.324 --> 49:55.575
- [Mr. Black] Easy.

49:55.575 --> 49:58.745
I did not want to have to do that, Sam.

49:58.745 --> 50:00.789
We started off on the wrong foot here

50:00.789 --> 50:03.291
and I can appreciate the
gravity of the situation.

50:04.376 --> 50:06.962
I mean, I kill most of your buddies,

50:06.962 --> 50:09.881
I kidnap your adorable lovely wife.

50:09.881 --> 50:12.718
Hell, I even busted your
fucking gate out here.

50:14.261 --> 50:16.179
And if you had a little doggy,

50:16.179 --> 50:17.973
I probably would've shot that too.

50:17.973 --> 50:19.641
- [Sam] You murdered innocent people

50:19.641 --> 50:22.019
over a formula for growing weed?

50:22.019 --> 50:23.937
You sadistic fuck.

50:25.397 --> 50:27.858
- [Mr. Black] Yeah, you're right, I did.

50:27.858 --> 50:29.151
And you want to know why?

50:30.444 --> 50:33.405
Because the good Lord has
cursed his greatest creation

50:33.405 --> 50:35.365
when he gave us free will, Sam.

50:36.783 --> 50:39.745
Saving lives, taking lives,

50:39.745 --> 50:40.954
in the grand scheme of things

50:40.954 --> 50:43.248
does it really make a difference?

50:43.248 --> 50:44.499
Because I got to ask you,

50:45.375 --> 50:47.127
I don't know who she is,

50:47.127 --> 50:48.962
but if she needed you,

50:48.962 --> 50:52.132
what would you do to save her, Sammy boy?

50:54.134 --> 50:57.054
(muffled speaking)

50:58.430 --> 51:00.015
That's what it's all about, pal?

51:01.391 --> 51:06.396
Distilled irrigation,
phosphorus, 15% potassium.

51:07.147 --> 51:09.900
Not that I know what the
fuck I'm looking at here,

51:09.900 --> 51:11.526
but I have to say I am impressed.

51:13.070 --> 51:14.279
I mean after all,

51:14.279 --> 51:15.989
your little set up out here

51:15.989 --> 51:18.033
ain't exactly a
breakthrough type of place.

51:18.033 --> 51:21.328
- [Ace] Now, now boss, didn't
Microsoft start in a garage?

51:21.328 --> 51:23.914
(laughing)

51:23.914 --> 51:25.332
- [Sam] If you got what you wanted,

51:25.332 --> 51:27.167
then why are you still here?

51:27.167 --> 51:28.460
- [Mr. Black] Million dollar question.

51:29.503 --> 51:32.506
You see when grandma's
little strunzo over here

51:32.506 --> 51:33.715
told me about you,

51:35.217 --> 51:38.512
I have to say that I was dubious at best.

51:39.387 --> 51:42.390
I mean, here's a guy that pulls
off the fucking unthinkable,

51:44.434 --> 51:47.354
the guy actually develops a cure

51:47.354 --> 51:49.356
for a disease that's
got a greater death toll

51:49.356 --> 51:50.941
than the fucking Holocaust

51:52.692 --> 51:54.861
and he doesn't want to
cash in his golden ticket

51:54.861 --> 51:55.904
and get rich.

51:56.780 --> 52:00.075
When I heard this, I says to myself,

52:00.075 --> 52:01.910
I got to meet this fucking guy.

52:04.538 --> 52:06.164
- [Sniper] Come on, open up.

52:06.164 --> 52:09.334
(ominous music)

52:09.334 --> 52:10.418
- [Mr. Black] What is it, Sam?

52:11.336 --> 52:12.921
What is it?

52:12.921 --> 52:14.381
- [Sam] What are you talking about?

52:16.299 --> 52:17.759
- [Mr. Black] I got a hard time believing

52:17.759 --> 52:20.095
that a man that's so fucking good,

52:21.179 --> 52:23.640
a man that's so self-righteous

52:23.640 --> 52:25.350
doesn't want to heal anyone?

52:26.434 --> 52:28.937
Something's not lining up here, Sam.

52:28.937 --> 52:30.689
- [Sam] You'll never understand.

52:30.689 --> 52:32.816
Look at me, a piece of shit like you,

52:32.816 --> 52:33.942
you'll never understand.

52:33.942 --> 52:36.236
- [Mr. Black] What are you
not telling everyone, Sam?

52:37.112 --> 52:38.697
What's not on this list?

52:41.408 --> 52:42.242
(cocks gun)

52:42.242 --> 52:44.202
I'll put a bullet in the
back of her head, I swear it.

52:44.202 --> 52:45.036
What is it?

52:45.036 --> 52:46.997
- [Sam] All right fine, it's Op-
(gunfire blasting)

52:47.873 --> 52:49.708
- [Mr. Black] Mother fucker.

52:49.708 --> 52:52.377
(ominous music)

52:54.713 --> 52:56.756
(gunfire blasting)

52:56.756 --> 53:01.761
(calm opera music)
(gunfire blasting)

53:03.972 --> 53:05.682
(bullet swiping past)

53:05.682 --> 53:10.645
(calm opera music)
(gunfire blasting)

54:40.235 --> 54:45.156
(horn honking)

54:45.156 --> 54:48.660
(horn honking)

54:48.660 --> 54:51.871
- [Sam] Hey, no, it's okay, it's over.

54:51.871 --> 54:54.541
(ominous music)

55:01.506 --> 55:02.882
Shit.

55:02.882 --> 55:05.552
(ominous music)

55:38.293 --> 55:40.378
[Sam] If I were you, I'd shoot me.

55:40.378 --> 55:42.380
Because whoever the fuck you are,

55:42.380 --> 55:43.548
when I find you,

55:43.548 --> 55:44.966
and I will find you,

55:47.010 --> 55:48.887
you'll be lucky if all I do is kill you,

55:50.138 --> 55:51.222
you fucking piece of shit.

55:52.974 --> 55:55.727
(ominous music)

56:00.440 --> 56:02.609
Hey, look at me, baby.

56:02.609 --> 56:04.110
It's okay. I'm gonna get us out of here,

56:04.110 --> 56:05.195
all right? Okay?

56:05.195 --> 56:08.531
Tim, you okay?

56:09.699 --> 56:10.533
- [Tim] Yeah.

56:11.493 --> 56:13.828
That asshole fucked me up, didn't he?

56:16.998 --> 56:20.126
(Parker mumbling)

56:20.126 --> 56:21.294
(gunfire blasting)

56:27.509 --> 56:29.719
- [Sam] Hey, he's not gonna shoot us.

56:29.719 --> 56:32.764
Look at me, he's not gonna shoot us.

56:32.764 --> 56:35.433
(gentle music)

56:41.272 --> 56:42.440
- [Amanda] Sam, your leg.

56:42.440 --> 56:45.026
(gentle music)

56:49.322 --> 56:50.156
- [Sam] Baby.

56:50.156 --> 56:52.742
(gentle music)

56:54.661 --> 56:55.495
Are you okay?

56:55.495 --> 56:56.329
I'm so sorry.

56:56.329 --> 56:57.414
Are you okay?

56:57.414 --> 56:58.331

I'd wind up back at war

or somewhere worse.

1:01:58.631 --> 1:01:59.924
- [Vincent] Jimmy, how are we doing?

1:01:59.924 --> 1:02:00.758
- [Jimmy] All right.

1:02:00.758 --> 1:02:01.968
- [Vincent] Drinking or working?

1:02:01.968 --> 1:02:02.802
- [Jimmy] Working.

1:02:02.802 --> 1:02:04.095
- [Parker] Ah, Victor, my man,

1:02:04.095 --> 1:02:06.264
I am in desperate need of tequila.

1:02:06.264 --> 1:02:08.057
- [Vincent] It's Vincent.

1:02:08.057 --> 1:02:09.600
- [Parker] Isn't that what I just said?

1:02:11.519 --> 1:02:16.190
Oh fuck, God, I'm really
sucking a fat one tonight,

1:02:16.190 --> 1:02:17.024
let me tell ya.

1:02:18.317 --> 1:02:21.112
Oh, apologies if that's
what you're into man.

1:02:24.949 --> 1:02:26.743
Hey don't I know you from somewhere?

1:02:28.786 --> 1:02:29.620
- [Jimmy] No.

1:02:31.998 --> 1:02:33.833
- [Parker] Some personality on him, eh?

1:02:33.833 --> 1:02:35.585
- [Vincent] That'll be 16 bucks.

1:02:37.003 --> 1:02:39.213
- [Parker] Oh I thought
it was on the house here.

1:02:39.213 --> 1:02:41.132
- [Vincent] Oh, sorry
pal, policy just ended.

1:02:43.968 --> 1:02:46.095
- [Parker] I just lost 100 grand...

1:02:50.183 --> 1:02:51.017
Fuck.

1:02:54.061 --> 1:02:56.355
- [Mr. Black] All right
kid, what am I gonna find

1:02:56.355 --> 1:02:57.940
on granny's pot farm?

1:02:57.940 --> 1:02:58.900
What kind of security we talking about?

1:02:58.900 --> 1:03:00.151
- [Parker] Chain link fence.

1:03:00.151 --> 1:03:01.778
- [Mr. Black] Local PD?

1:03:01.778 --> 1:03:03.529
- [Parker] 30 miles away at best.

1:03:06.365 --> 1:03:07.200
- [Mr. Black] All right, Mr. Renfro,

1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:09.952
you got 48 hours to get
granny off that farm.

1:03:09.952 --> 1:03:11.621
Can you do that for me?

1:03:11.621 --> 1:03:13.748
- [Parker] Well, what
happens after 48 hours?

1:03:13.748 --> 1:03:15.374
- [Mr. Black] Cut him loose.

1:03:15.374 --> 1:03:17.293
- [Parker] What happens after 48 hours?

1:03:17.293 --> 1:03:19.754
(Parker grunting)

1:03:19.754 --> 1:03:22.465
- [Jimmy] So let me get this straight,

1:03:22.465 --> 1:03:25.843
you're asking me to take out
seven men inside of a minute?

1:03:25.843 --> 1:03:27.428
- [Ace] Asking?

1:03:27.428 --> 1:03:28.763
Hell, we're telling.

1:03:29.931 --> 1:03:32.517
I thought you had some laundry
list of confirmed kills.

1:03:32.517 --> 1:03:36.145
Isn't this sort of thing supposed
to be in your wheelhouse?

1:03:36.145 --> 1:03:38.940
Now we were gonna give you
70 large for doing this,

1:03:38.940 --> 1:03:41.067
but now, you see,

1:03:41.067 --> 1:03:42.193
now I'm getting a sudden urge

1:03:42.193 --> 1:03:45.780
to make our little arrangement
here performance based.

1:03:45.780 --> 1:03:46.614
I'mma tell you what,

1:03:46.614 --> 1:03:48.908
we're gonna give you 10 grand
for every head you splatter

1:03:48.908 --> 1:03:51.202
before we roll in with the cleanup crew.

1:03:51.202 --> 1:03:53.538
You go seven for seven now,

1:03:53.538 --> 1:03:55.206
I'll personally guarantee you 80.

1:03:56.207 --> 1:03:57.708
- [Jimmy] Sounds good.

1:03:57.708 --> 1:03:58.668
Anything else?

1:03:59.627 --> 1:04:00.962
- [Ace] We good here, boss?

1:04:03.631 --> 1:04:08.010
- [Mr. Black] The leader. This Sam Paxton.

1:04:10.137 --> 1:04:11.806
I want him alive.

1:04:11.806 --> 1:04:15.685
You wound him, but he's
alive when we get there.

1:04:16.561 --> 1:04:17.395
You got that?

1:04:19.063 --> 1:04:21.315
- [Jimmy] And how am I supposed
to know which one he is?

1:04:22.567 --> 1:04:23.568
- [Mr. Black] I'm sure
you've found yourself

1:04:23.568 --> 1:04:25.570
in a police lineup or two.

1:04:25.570 --> 1:04:28.364
Figure it out, okay slick?

1:04:28.364 --> 1:04:30.032
- [Ace] You can go now.

1:04:30.032 --> 1:04:32.785
(ominous music)

1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:37.456
- [Mr. Black] Oh and Ace,
let's find out if our guy's a

1:04:37.456 --> 1:04:40.293
family man. We're gonna
need some insurance.

1:04:40.293 --> 1:04:44.380
- [Ace] You know boss,
I'll notify Carl and Willy

1:04:44.380 --> 1:04:45.756
to pick up the next of kin,

1:04:45.756 --> 1:04:48.050
but may I ask our of pure curiosity,

1:04:48.050 --> 1:04:49.719
why are we leaving this man alive?

1:04:51.470 --> 1:04:53.973
- [Mr. Black] If you knew the
six winning jackpot numbers,

1:04:55.391 --> 1:04:59.312
but for some reason you're not cashing in,

1:04:59.312 --> 1:05:01.731
would you write down all six,

1:05:01.731 --> 1:05:04.150
leave 'em around for two
crooks like us to steal

1:05:06.152 --> 1:05:08.279
or would you put down five

1:05:08.279 --> 1:05:10.072
and leave one in the safe up here?

1:05:11.073 --> 1:05:13.951
That, plus I'd just
like to know the reason.

1:05:15.036 --> 1:05:16.120
- [Ace] The reason boss?

1:05:17.663 --> 1:05:19.624
- [Mr. Black] Why is
this man not cashing in?

1:05:23.210 --> 1:05:25.880
(phone ringing)

1:05:32.678 --> 1:05:33.638
- [Jimmy] Sam, pick up.

1:05:39.727 --> 1:05:41.020
- [Amanda] Yeah, hello?

1:05:42.438 --> 1:05:45.107
(ominous music)

1:05:50.696 --> 1:05:53.324
- [Jimmy] Hey Sam, been a bit, bro.

1:05:56.118 --> 1:06:00.247
Oh by the way, been a gun
for hire the last three years

1:06:04.085 --> 1:06:04.961
and my latest job

1:06:06.587 --> 1:06:08.214
is to kill you and all your men.

1:06:11.884 --> 1:06:13.094
But how you been?

1:06:17.932 --> 1:06:18.766
You know brother,

1:06:20.476 --> 1:06:21.310
I bet neither of us

1:06:21.310 --> 1:06:23.604
figured the paths of our
bad choices would cross.

1:06:29.819 --> 1:06:31.821
- [Tim] And then he said,
Charlie M or something,

1:06:31.821 --> 1:06:33.489
I don't know.

1:06:33.489 --> 1:06:34.740
It was weird.

1:06:34.740 --> 1:06:37.326
- [Amanda] Charlie M, what is that?

1:06:37.326 --> 1:06:39.161
- [Tim] It's from the movie "Casino".

1:06:39.161 --> 1:06:39.996
You ever seen "Casino"?

1:06:39.996 --> 1:06:41.247
- [Amanda] No.

1:06:41.247 --> 1:06:44.542
- [Tim] Yeah it's weird, I don't know.

1:06:44.542 --> 1:06:46.252
- [Amanda] Is this over now?

1:06:46.252 --> 1:06:48.004
- [Sam] I got to get you somewhere safe.

1:06:48.004 --> 1:06:50.006
- [Amanda] Are you gonna
tell me what's going on?

1:06:51.924 --> 1:06:55.136
(ominous music)

1:06:55.136 --> 1:06:56.637
- [Sam] It was Jimmy.

1:06:56.637 --> 1:06:58.973
- [Amanda] Jimmy, your
old war buddy, Jimmy?

1:07:00.933 --> 1:07:01.851
He did all this?

1:07:01.851 --> 1:07:06.022
- [Sam] Well yeah, he's also
the reason we're still alive.

1:07:06.022 --> 1:07:07.773
- [Amanda] Great, I'll be sure to send him

1:07:07.773 --> 1:07:08.983
a thank you letter.

1:07:10.401 --> 1:07:11.777
- [Sam] What about you Tim?

1:07:13.487 --> 1:07:14.697
- [Tim] All I know

1:07:14.697 --> 1:07:16.782
is I don't want to see that
fucking maniac ever again.

1:07:19.410 --> 1:07:23.456
But besides, someone's got to stick around

1:07:23.456 --> 1:07:24.540
and water the plants.

1:07:27.043 --> 1:07:27.877
- [Sam] Hey, I'm sorry.

1:07:30.087 --> 1:07:32.006
I'm sorry I couldn't get to before um,

1:07:34.341 --> 1:07:35.760
before all this.

1:07:38.804 --> 1:07:40.681
- [Tim] I'm still breathing, right?

1:07:40.681 --> 1:07:43.350
(ominous music)

1:07:58.240 --> 1:07:59.075
- [Sam] Are you okay?

1:08:00.701 --> 1:08:02.745
You haven't said anything the whole ride.

1:08:04.747 --> 1:08:08.501
- [Amanda] I have a lot
of unanswered questions.

1:08:10.836 --> 1:08:12.880
I know you're the victim,

1:08:14.215 --> 1:08:17.384
but that monster

1:08:17.384 --> 1:08:22.389
seemed like he was going
to expose you, Sam,

1:08:22.389 --> 1:08:24.850
as if he knew some sort of secret.

1:08:24.850 --> 1:08:26.519
- [Sam] What secret?

1:08:26.519 --> 1:08:27.560
- [Amanda] I don't know,

1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:29.772
but when he held a fucking gun to my head

1:08:29.772 --> 1:08:32.023
it seemed as if you were
about to blurt it out.

1:08:33.651 --> 1:08:34.485
- [Sam] We're there.

1:08:35.944 --> 1:08:36.862
- [Amanda] Of course we are.

1:08:41.617 --> 1:08:42.576
So what's the plan?

1:08:48.332 --> 1:08:49.166
- [Sam] Hey.

1:08:50.501 --> 1:08:52.128
- [Amanda] That's your plan?

1:08:52.128 --> 1:08:53.379
That's the plan?

1:08:53.379 --> 1:08:55.714
- [Sam] You're not gonna have to use it.

1:08:55.714 --> 1:08:59.050
But if you do, it's just like the range.

1:09:01.679 --> 1:09:04.014
(cocks gun)

1:09:08.144 --> 1:09:12.857
Hey, unless you hear
anything, stay here. Okay?

1:09:16.193 --> 1:09:17.903
- [Amanda] I guess
we'll finish this later.

1:09:22.825 --> 1:09:23.658
- [Sam] Noscapine.

1:09:25.244 --> 1:09:26.370
- [Amanda] Nosca, what?

1:09:26.370 --> 1:09:28.121
- [Sam] If you reverse engineer opium,

1:09:28.121 --> 1:09:29.832
you can isolate a compound called

1:09:29.832 --> 1:09:30.666
noscapine.

1:09:31.666 --> 1:09:32.626
It's not an addictive pain killer,

1:09:32.626 --> 1:09:34.420
so big pharma's got no use for it,

1:09:35.504 --> 1:09:37.505
but it inhibits cancer cells.

1:09:37.505 --> 1:09:40.259
(ominous music)

1:09:45.431 --> 1:09:46.264
- [Amanda] What?

1:09:49.768 --> 1:09:50.935
(Amanda sighs)

1:09:50.935 --> 1:09:54.023
(ominous music)

1:10:21.133 --> 1:10:23.469
(pulls gun)

1:10:35.856 --> 1:10:38.692
(dramatic music)

1:10:46.075 --> 1:10:47.493
- [Sam] Oh Jesus, fuck.

1:10:47.493 --> 1:10:49.245
(gunfire blasting)

1:10:49.245 --> 1:10:51.080
- [Amanda] Fuck, what the fuck?

1:10:52.748 --> 1:10:53.582
- [Jimmy] Sam?

1:10:53.582 --> 1:10:55.541
- [Sam] Put the fucking gun down, man.

1:10:55.541 --> 1:10:56.377
What the fuck?

1:10:56.377 --> 1:10:57.460
Hey Jimmy-

1:10:57.460 --> 1:10:58.295
- [Jimmy] What the fuck
are you doing here?

1:10:58.295 --> 1:11:00.505
- [Sam] Put the fucking gun down.

1:11:00.505 --> 1:11:02.591
Jesus Christ, hey look.

1:11:02.591 --> 1:11:03.675
Oh my. Fuck.

1:11:13.559 --> 1:11:15.312
Jesus fucking christ.

1:11:22.778 --> 1:11:25.739
Nah, come on man, this is bullshit.

1:11:27.157 --> 1:11:28.200
- [Jimmy] You find my letter?

1:11:30.035 --> 1:11:31.620
- [Sam] Yeah man, I found your letter.

1:11:34.832 --> 1:11:36.083
- [Jimmy] I'm sorry, I didn't know.

1:11:36.083 --> 1:11:37.251
- [Sam] Hey Jimmy look,

1:11:37.251 --> 1:11:38.585
I said I found the letter.

1:11:44.258 --> 1:11:45.300
- [Jimmy] Well if you're
not here to kill me,

1:11:45.300 --> 1:11:46.135
what do you want?

1:11:47.636 --> 1:11:49.972
- [Sam] I take it your
boss is still alive?

1:11:51.639 --> 1:11:52.558
- [Jimmy] You don't want to go there.

1:11:52.558 --> 1:11:57.563
- [Sam] I want my family safe. All right?

1:11:57.646 --> 1:11:59.481
The way I see it,

1:11:59.481 --> 1:12:02.651
you don't get to take your
life, until I take his.

1:12:04.528 --> 1:12:06.989
Now you gonna put that fucking gun down?

1:12:09.241 --> 1:12:11.910
(ominous music)

1:12:14.955 --> 1:12:18.834
- [Amanda] Stop pointing
that gun at my husband.

1:12:18.834 --> 1:12:20.002
- [Sam] It's not for me.

1:12:21.170 --> 1:12:23.839
(ominous music)

1:12:25.132 --> 1:12:27.175
- [Jimmy] Sorry about
this whole mess, darlin'.

1:12:30.219 --> 1:12:32.681
- [Amanda] Just put it down, Jimmy.

1:12:32.681 --> 1:12:35.351
(ominous music)

1:12:43.901 --> 1:12:45.903
- Wasted my last bullet on you anyways.

1:12:47.862 --> 1:12:52.576
- [Sam] So this Mr.
Black, how do we get him?

1:12:52.576 --> 1:12:55.412
(dramatic music)

1:13:03.629 --> 1:13:05.339
- [Jimmy] If you're guessing
Black was a fake name,

1:13:05.339 --> 1:13:06.882
you're right.

1:13:06.882 --> 1:13:08.425
His real name is Caesar Bonnano,

1:13:09.635 --> 1:13:11.594
bastard of the Bonnano crime family.

1:13:12.471 --> 1:13:13.680
His father was an Italian

1:13:13.680 --> 1:13:15.057
and his mother was a Jew,

1:13:15.057 --> 1:13:16.517
making him a half-breed,

1:13:17.893 --> 1:13:20.020
meaning he could only
rise so far in the mafia

1:13:20.020 --> 1:13:20.896
and he knew that.

1:13:21.939 --> 1:13:24.566
So, changed his name, moved out west.

1:13:25.984 --> 1:13:27.568
His mob ties have loosened over the years.

1:13:27.568 --> 1:13:29.571
So long as he kicks back
something every now and again,

1:13:29.571 --> 1:13:30.823
he's his own boss.

1:13:33.282 --> 1:13:37.246
- [Sam] Family? Wife? Kids?

1:13:37.246 --> 1:13:39.164
- [Jimmy] He's got a
daughter, pretty smart kid.

1:13:39.164 --> 1:13:41.125
She goes to Cal-Tech.

1:13:41.125 --> 1:13:43.669
Wife though, doesn't leave the house much.

1:13:43.669 --> 1:13:44.503
- [Sam] No?

1:13:45.379 --> 1:13:47.423
- [Jimmy] She's got stage three leukemia.

1:13:48.549 --> 1:13:50.759
By the looks of it,
she's losing the battle.

1:13:50.759 --> 1:13:53.262
- [Amanda] Explains why
he's so obsessed with you.

1:13:53.262 --> 1:13:54.096
- [Sam] Hmm.

1:13:55.180 --> 1:13:56.557
Where do we find him?

1:13:56.557 --> 1:13:58.434
- [Jimmy] He also runs an
underground gambling racket

1:13:58.434 --> 1:13:59.934
outside of Los Angeles.

1:14:01.186 --> 1:14:04.022
His high stakes tables bring
in some pretty high rollers.

1:14:05.065 --> 1:14:07.901
That's padded the man's ego quite a bit.

1:14:07.901 --> 1:14:09.820
Although they still think he's a crook.

1:14:11.487 --> 1:14:13.282
He doesn't like that either.

1:14:13.282 --> 1:14:15.868
(jazz music)

1:14:45.689 --> 1:14:47.483
- [Mr. Black] Carter, welcome.

1:14:50.527 --> 1:14:52.154
- [Carter] Nice to see you, Caesar.

1:14:53.947 --> 1:14:55.073
- [Mr. Black] Charlie,
serve the man a drink...

1:14:55.073 --> 1:14:55.907
will ya, please?

1:14:55.907 --> 1:14:57.159
- [Charlie] What are
we drinking gentlemen?

1:14:57.159 --> 1:14:58.660
- [Mr. Black] Scotch, man, if I recall?

1:14:59.786 --> 1:15:01.038
- [Carter] Tequila.

1:15:01.038 --> 1:15:02.831
- [Mr. Black] Tequila, really?

1:15:02.831 --> 1:15:05.584
Casa Leon Charlie, on the rocks.

1:15:05.584 --> 1:15:07.085
- [Charlie] Coming right up.

1:15:07.085 --> 1:15:11.507
- [Carter] So, is this the magic recipe?

1:15:11.507 --> 1:15:14.510
Looks like I should have
brought the entire legal team.

1:15:14.510 --> 1:15:15.844
- [Mr. Black] Ha, no need for that.

1:15:15.844 --> 1:15:18.305
This is what you're looking for.

1:15:18.305 --> 1:15:20.933
And I had to go to some
great lengths to get it.

1:15:20.933 --> 1:15:22.351
- [Carter] And I'm here to compensate.

1:15:23.227 --> 1:15:25.353
- [Mr. Black] Oh, you'll be
bringing me a lot of money

1:15:25.353 --> 1:15:27.773
and not just what fits in
Ivan's briefcase over there.

1:15:31.151 --> 1:15:31.985
Salud.

1:15:33.153 --> 1:15:34.655
l'chaim.
- [Carter] l'chaim.

1:15:38.367 --> 1:15:41.827
- [Mr. Black] This is the
account I want my funds wired to

1:15:43.830 --> 1:15:45.541
and this is the amount
you're gonna transfer tonight

1:15:45.541 --> 1:15:46.625
before you leave.

1:15:47.918 --> 1:15:50.379
And the Paxton formula's all yours.

1:15:50.379 --> 1:15:51.505
(Carter laughing)

1:15:51.505 --> 1:15:53.298
- [Carter] It doesn't
work exactly like that.

1:15:54.550 --> 1:15:56.802
There has to be testing, quality controls,

1:15:56.802 --> 1:15:58.344
that kind of thing.

1:15:58.344 --> 1:16:00.806
How do I even know this is real?

1:16:01.639 --> 1:16:04.393
- [Mr. Black] Because I have
to be some sort of idiot

1:16:04.393 --> 1:16:05.519
to cross you.

1:16:06.562 --> 1:16:09.523
And you know? With all of my flaws,

1:16:09.523 --> 1:16:13.735
I think I can clearly say
that idiocy ain't on the list.

1:16:13.735 --> 1:16:15.195
Then there's the simple fact that

1:16:15.195 --> 1:16:17.823
this formula doesn't leave here tonight

1:16:17.823 --> 1:16:19.575
unless I'm a very happy man.

1:16:23.495 --> 1:16:25.621
- [Carter] I have to make a phone call.

1:16:25.621 --> 1:16:28.875
- [Mr. Black] Wait, before you
do, there's one more thing.

1:16:31.085 --> 1:16:33.463
- [Carter] What's that, you forget a zero?

1:16:33.463 --> 1:16:36.592
- [Mr. Black] Carter, I'm
no conspiracy theorist,

1:16:36.592 --> 1:16:38.175
but you don't have to be

1:16:38.175 --> 1:16:40.178
to know that you guys ain't
looking to cure jack shit.

1:16:40.178 --> 1:16:41.054
- [Carter] Well now...

1:16:41.054 --> 1:16:43.432
- [Mr. Black] I get it, I do.

1:16:43.432 --> 1:16:46.434
You guys got a bottom
line. World's got to spin.

1:16:47.686 --> 1:16:50.272
Jokers don't understand
the troubles of a King.

1:16:52.023 --> 1:16:54.401
Unfortunately, I find myself

1:16:54.401 --> 1:16:56.153
on the wrong end of the hierarchy.

1:16:57.237 --> 1:17:01.992
You see, my wife, she's got it...

1:17:04.119 --> 1:17:05.579
she's dying.

1:17:08.373 --> 1:17:10.208
And I'm the joker that can't fix her.

1:17:13.253 --> 1:17:16.505
But now you're a King
that can, and you will.

1:17:18.592 --> 1:17:19.843
- [Carter] I'll do my best.

1:17:19.843 --> 1:17:21.011
- [Mr. Black] Your best?

1:17:21.011 --> 1:17:23.597
See there's something you
may already know about me,

1:17:23.597 --> 1:17:26.600
yeah my head ain't
screwed on like most folks

1:17:26.600 --> 1:17:28.477
and I ain't playing with a full deck,

1:17:28.477 --> 1:17:30.937
but I am playing with a fixed one

1:17:30.937 --> 1:17:35.150
meaning that, I don't
give a fuck who you are.

1:17:35.150 --> 1:17:38.945
You do wrong by me and I'll gut ya.

1:17:38.945 --> 1:17:41.615
Make Ivan and all your king's men watch.

1:17:43.157 --> 1:17:45.994
- [Carter] You really are
a sick fuck, aren't ya?

1:17:47.412 --> 1:17:48.496
- [Mr. Black] You have no idea.

1:17:52.501 --> 1:17:54.710
Ah, now you can make your phone call.

1:17:54.710 --> 1:17:57.464
(ominous music)

1:18:04.388 --> 1:18:06.807
Pleasure seeing you as always Carter.

1:18:06.807 --> 1:18:08.183
- [Carter] It was something.

1:18:08.183 --> 1:18:09.017
- [Mr. Black] Why don't
you hit the tables while

1:18:09.017 --> 1:18:09.851
you're here?

1:18:09.851 --> 1:18:12.978
Tell you what, first 100K's on me?

1:18:12.978 --> 1:18:14.856
- [Carter] I'll take a rain check on that.

1:18:14.856 --> 1:18:15.691
- [Mr. Black] Anytime.

1:18:20.112 --> 1:18:23.031
What do ya say Charlie,
another round, me and you?

1:18:23.031 --> 1:18:23.865
Pour it up.

1:18:23.865 --> 1:18:25.282
- [Charlie] Already on it.

1:18:25.282 --> 1:18:27.827
(phone ringing)

1:18:27.827 --> 1:18:29.955
I got this boss, probably the pit.

1:18:29.955 --> 1:18:31.456
Mr. B's, what's up?

1:18:34.835 --> 1:18:35.669
Oh yeah?

1:18:38.422 --> 1:18:40.340
Yeah, just a second.

1:18:40.340 --> 1:18:42.843
Boss, I think you're
gonna want to take this.

1:18:42.843 --> 1:18:44.511
- [Mr. Black] Who is it, my wife?

1:18:47.139 --> 1:18:47.973
Who is this?

1:18:47.973 --> 1:18:48.807
- [Jimmy] I bet you're feeling pretty good

1:18:48.807 --> 1:18:50.142
about yourself right now.

1:18:50.142 --> 1:18:52.018
- [Mr. Black] Who are you and
how'd you get this number?

1:18:52.018 --> 1:18:53.019
- [Jimmy] That was a nice move you played

1:18:53.019 --> 1:18:54.938
with the van and the horn.

1:18:54.938 --> 1:18:56.314
- [Mr. Black] They didn't teach
you double tap your target

1:18:56.314 --> 1:18:58.525
in sniper school, you fuck?

1:18:58.525 --> 1:19:00.693
- [Jimmy] Guess I must've missed that day.

1:19:00.693 --> 1:19:02.612
- [Mr. Black] You're a
dead man, you know that?

1:19:02.612 --> 1:19:03.655
You better find

1:19:03.655 --> 1:19:05.323
some fucking far corner
of the Earth to hide in

1:19:05.323 --> 1:19:06.950
'cause I'm gonna fucking
kill you, you rat fuck.

1:19:06.950 --> 1:19:07.784
I'm coming for ya.

1:19:07.784 --> 1:19:10.077
- [Jimmy] Well before I get my head start,

1:19:10.077 --> 1:19:11.371
let me ask you one question.

1:19:11.371 --> 1:19:12.205
- [Mr. Black] What's that?

1:19:12.205 --> 1:19:13.707
- [Jimmy] How often do you pay attention

1:19:13.707 --> 1:19:16.126
to the faces at your tables?

1:19:17.002 --> 1:19:19.379
(ominous music)

1:19:19.379 --> 1:19:20.297
- [Charlie] Is everything all right, boss?

1:19:20.297 --> 1:19:22.007
- [Mr. Black] Yeah. Pull the
table cameras up on that thing,

1:19:22.007 --> 1:19:23.216
will ya, please?

1:19:23.216 --> 1:19:24.175
- [Charlie] Yeah, one second.

1:19:25.260 --> 1:19:27.929
(ominous music)

1:19:36.772 --> 1:19:38.565
- [Mr. Black] Oh, this just
gets better and better.

1:19:40.358 --> 1:19:43.111
(ominous music)

1:20:01.671 --> 1:20:02.505
You know when I taught you

1:20:02.505 --> 1:20:04.132
about the good Lord's biggest fuck up

1:20:04.132 --> 1:20:05.800
about giving us free will,

1:20:05.800 --> 1:20:08.844
I didn't think you'd take
it as a personal challenge.

1:20:08.844 --> 1:20:09.763
Get up.

1:20:10.931 --> 1:20:12.474
- [Gambler] I'm on a bit of a roll here.

1:20:12.474 --> 1:20:13.433
- [Mr. Black] Oh yeah?

1:20:14.768 --> 1:20:16.978
- [Gambler] Hey, hey.

1:20:18.772 --> 1:20:20.232
- [Mr. Black] We'll set
you up at another table.

1:20:20.232 --> 1:20:21.900
- [Sam] That's a shame.

1:20:21.900 --> 1:20:23.985
Yeah, that guy was really on a hot streak.

1:20:25.612 --> 1:20:26.446
- [Mr. Black] Shame.

1:20:29.491 --> 1:20:30.325
- [Dealer] Bust.

1:20:31.785 --> 1:20:32.827
- [Mr. Black] Play on, Sam.

1:20:48.218 --> 1:20:50.929
Looks like I stole your
queen there again pal, huh?

1:20:52.222 --> 1:20:53.223
- [Sam] Yeah, it would appear so.

1:20:53.223 --> 1:20:54.891
- [Mr. Black] So I just
got off the phone with your

1:20:54.891 --> 1:20:56.184
shit bag friend.

1:20:56.184 --> 1:20:58.687
- [Sam] Oh, now you mean the mercenary

1:20:58.687 --> 1:21:00.313
that you hired to kill me?

1:21:00.313 --> 1:21:01.565
- [Mr. Black] It would
appear I hired the wrong guy

1:21:01.565 --> 1:21:02.398
for the job.

1:21:02.398 --> 1:21:03.233
- [Sam] Yeah maybe so.

1:21:04.734 --> 1:21:06.528
- [Mr. Black] So why are you here, Sammy?

1:21:06.528 --> 1:21:07.779
'Cause I got to tell ya,

1:21:07.779 --> 1:21:09.072
if you wanted to take me out,

1:21:09.072 --> 1:21:10.907
there's got to be 100 better ways

1:21:10.907 --> 1:21:12.157
you could have went about it

1:21:12.157 --> 1:21:14.244
than strolling through the lion's den.

1:21:14.244 --> 1:21:16.204
- [Sam] Mmm, so I take it by now

1:21:16.204 --> 1:21:18.498
you cashed in on what you
stole from me, then huh?

1:21:18.498 --> 1:21:20.250
- [Mr. Black] Oh, you missed
the boat on that big time

1:21:20.250 --> 1:21:21.084
pal of mine.

1:21:21.084 --> 1:21:22.669
- [Sam] Yeah, who was it?

1:21:22.669 --> 1:21:24.337
Pfizer, Scriptol...

1:21:25.422 --> 1:21:27.299
- [Mr. Black] El Chapo,
what's it matter to you?

1:21:27.299 --> 1:21:29.259
- [Sam] Ah, it doesn't

1:21:30.635 --> 1:21:32.344
just as long as it wasn't Scott's.

1:21:33.179 --> 1:21:34.889
- [Mr. Black] Scott's?

1:21:34.889 --> 1:21:35.724
- [Sam] Yeah, they already
know the ingredients

1:21:35.724 --> 1:21:36.558
to Miracle Grow.

1:21:40.812 --> 1:21:42.939
- [Mr. Black] Fuck you talking about kid?

1:21:42.939 --> 1:21:45.233
- [Sam] You sold your buyer

1:21:45.233 --> 1:21:47.235
the formula for Scott's Miracle Grow.

1:21:52.324 --> 1:21:53.407
- [Mr. Black] You're shitting me.

1:21:53.407 --> 1:21:55.201
I know a bullshitter when I see one.

1:21:56.577 --> 1:21:57.412
- [Sam] Do you?

1:21:59.748 --> 1:22:01.166
- [Mr. Black] You know, I've
been around a few blocks

1:22:01.166 --> 1:22:02.541
in my day,

1:22:02.541 --> 1:22:04.920
stared into the eyes of a lot of people,

1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:07.505
mostly cowards, very few champions.

1:22:07.505 --> 1:22:08.715
- [Sam] I'm gonna stop you right there.

1:22:08.715 --> 1:22:09.716
- [Mr. Black] Oh, I see,

1:22:09.716 --> 1:22:12.177
you think because you slid
a rook across the board,

1:22:12.177 --> 1:22:14.596
took my queen that you
got me in checkmate?

1:22:14.596 --> 1:22:15.555
You're forgetting whose board

1:22:15.555 --> 1:22:17.307
you're playing on, son.

1:22:17.307 --> 1:22:18.725
Take a look around you.

1:22:18.725 --> 1:22:21.603
What's to stop me from
dragging you out of here

1:22:21.603 --> 1:22:24.564
in front of all these nice
people by your fucking balls

1:22:24.564 --> 1:22:27.984
and beating the real
formula out of you, huh?

1:22:27.984 --> 1:22:31.029
It's been a while since I
personally dismembered somebody.

1:22:31.029 --> 1:22:32.822
You might be a good fucking candidate.

1:22:32.822 --> 1:22:33.657
(Sam laughing)

1:22:33.657 --> 1:22:34.866
- [Mr. Black] Oh, we're laughing now?

1:22:36.284 --> 1:22:38.662
- [Sam] Yeah, we're laughing now.

1:22:39.955 --> 1:22:42.374
You want to see something real funny?

1:22:42.374 --> 1:22:45.126
(dramatic music)

1:22:49.714 --> 1:22:51.841
- [Mr. Black] You cock
sucking, mother fucker.

1:22:51.841 --> 1:22:53.550
I'll rip your balls
off and feed 'em to ya.

1:22:53.550 --> 1:22:55.594
- [Sam] You know before you do that

1:22:55.594 --> 1:22:57.430
you may want to look a little closer.

1:22:58.723 --> 1:23:01.476
(dramatic music)

1:23:02.727 --> 1:23:04.270
- [Mr. Black] Look, I know your kind.

1:23:04.270 --> 1:23:05.355
You got some hair on your chest

1:23:05.355 --> 1:23:07.190
but you wouldn't kill an innocent woman.

1:23:07.190 --> 1:23:10.652
- [Mr. Black] Hmm, you know
maybe you're right about that.

1:23:11.778 --> 1:23:15.281
I wouldn't, but he would.

1:23:17.200 --> 1:23:18.952
Hey, Jimmy you there with me?

1:23:18.952 --> 1:23:20.996
- [Jimmy] Yeah, tell him blood red's

1:23:20.996 --> 1:23:23.665
really gonna clash with his decor.

1:23:23.665 --> 1:23:26.501
(dramatic music)

1:23:28.253 --> 1:23:31.005
- [Mr. Black] Look, you
hate me for what I did

1:23:31.005 --> 1:23:32.632
to your precious little pot farm.

1:23:33.591 --> 1:23:35.010
But let's be real,

1:23:35.010 --> 1:23:37.721
if it wasn't me it would've
been somebody else.

1:23:37.721 --> 1:23:39.889
You can't expect to hide
the cure for cancer,

1:23:39.889 --> 1:23:42.434
think that no one's gonna
want to take it from you.

1:23:42.434 --> 1:23:43.643
But yet you're smart enough to know

1:23:43.643 --> 1:23:46.103
that big pharma will chew
you up and spit you out.

1:23:47.313 --> 1:23:50.859
Look, I know we got off
to a rocky start, granted,

1:23:50.859 --> 1:23:52.235
but you need someone

1:23:52.235 --> 1:23:55.071
to make sure the big boys do right by you,

1:23:55.071 --> 1:23:56.448
someone who's got markers on guys

1:23:56.448 --> 1:23:58.450
a lot more powerful than Carter Winslow.

1:23:59.534 --> 1:24:01.827
- [Sam] And that someone, that's you?

1:24:04.080 --> 1:24:05.415
- [Mr. Black] If you could
promise me right here

1:24:05.415 --> 1:24:06.708
and right now

1:24:06.708 --> 1:24:09.460
that you save her, it'll have to be.

1:24:09.460 --> 1:24:11.421
And I'm not just talking
about telling that rat fuck

1:24:11.421 --> 1:24:12.380
to stand down.

1:24:13.548 --> 1:24:16.217
(ominous music)

1:24:22.724 --> 1:24:24.893
- [Sam] Why don't we finish
this business upstairs?

1:24:26.311 --> 1:24:27.687
I could use a drink anyway.

1:24:29.397 --> 1:24:31.483
- [Mr. Black] Now you're
starting to make some sense.

1:24:33.109 --> 1:24:33.943
Clyde.

1:24:37.989 --> 1:24:39.032
- [Sam] Give me your piece.

1:24:41.284 --> 1:24:42.827
(laughing)

1:24:42.827 --> 1:24:43.787
I'm serious.

1:24:45.871 --> 1:24:47.499
- [Guard] This cool with you, boss?

1:24:47.499 --> 1:24:48.333
- [Mr. Black] Go ahead.

1:24:50.460 --> 1:24:53.129
(ominous music)

1:24:57.092 --> 1:24:57.925
- [Sam] Lead the way.

1:24:59.761 --> 1:25:02.514
(ominous music)

1:25:04.014 --> 1:25:05.475
- [Mr. Black] Sammy, I just got to know,

1:25:05.475 --> 1:25:07.352
'cause I was right, wasn't I?

1:25:07.352 --> 1:25:09.853
There's a key ingredient
you left off that list.

1:25:11.606 --> 1:25:13.858
- [Sam] I guess there's no
harm in telling you now, right?

1:25:14.818 --> 1:25:16.361
It's a compound found in opium.

1:25:20.740 --> 1:25:22.450
- [Mr. Black] Typical, they keep the stuff

1:25:22.450 --> 1:25:23.868
that can actually help people locked up

1:25:23.868 --> 1:25:25.829
while the entire industry
makes fucking billions

1:25:25.829 --> 1:25:27.330
pushing poison without a cure.

1:25:29.457 --> 1:25:30.333
- Mother fucker.

1:25:30.333 --> 1:25:33.128
(gunfire blasting)

1:25:33.128 --> 1:25:35.797
(ominous music)

1:25:47.809 --> 1:25:49.018
(phone ringing)

1:25:49.018 --> 1:25:53.022
- [Sam] Amanda, get out of there.

1:25:53.022 --> 1:25:54.398
- [Amanda] Copy that.

1:25:55.942 --> 1:25:58.570
(gentle music)

1:26:23.344 --> 1:26:25.013
- [Sam] Caesar Black wanted me to tell you

1:26:25.013 --> 1:26:27.724
that he mixed up your formula,

1:26:28.892 --> 1:26:32.270
although I'm sure by now you
already figured that one out.

1:26:32.270 --> 1:26:33.897
- [Carter] Who the fuck are you?

1:26:34.772 --> 1:26:38.193
- [Sam] You wanted my
formula, right? The real one?

1:26:39.443 --> 1:26:40.278
It's yours.

1:26:42.237 --> 1:26:44.907
- [Carter] Let me guess, Sam Paxton.

1:26:46.910 --> 1:26:48.786
You didn't have to bring
that gun to leave here

1:26:48.786 --> 1:26:49.579
a rich man.

1:26:49.579 --> 1:26:52.582
- [Sam] Now I'm afraid
it's just not that simple.

1:26:52.582 --> 1:26:55.168
You see I have what you want.

1:26:55.168 --> 1:26:57.670
Now you Mr. Winslow have
the power that I need

1:26:58.630 --> 1:27:00.423
and I'm not talking about your money

1:27:01.424 --> 1:27:04.719
although you're gonna be
spending plenty of that too.

1:27:05.929 --> 1:27:07.680
You see, within my research,

1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:11.684
there are certain legal
red flags, let's call 'em.

1:27:12.518 --> 1:27:14.228
Now what you're gonna do

1:27:14.228 --> 1:27:17.732
is influence the FDA to get
around those legal red flags.

1:27:18.816 --> 1:27:22.320
And once you do, you
and I are gonna be known

1:27:22.320 --> 1:27:25.114
as the men that cured cancer.

1:27:25.114 --> 1:27:27.659
- [Carter] The men that cured cancer?

1:27:27.659 --> 1:27:32.121
- [Sam] Now, I understand that
this right here means the end

1:27:32.121 --> 1:27:34.540
to your biggest revenue stream,

1:27:34.540 --> 1:27:37.835
but you are gonna have to see
that through a different lens

1:27:37.835 --> 1:27:40.255
because while all your
other competitors out there

1:27:40.255 --> 1:27:45.260
are gonna be offering
poison treatments, you sir,

1:27:45.593 --> 1:27:48.846
you'll be the only guy on
the block with the cure,

1:27:48.846 --> 1:27:50.181
exclusive to you.

1:27:52.976 --> 1:27:55.645
(ominous music)

1:27:58.022 --> 1:28:02.485
- [Carter] You need to put
that gun down and get me a pen.

1:28:03.528 --> 1:28:04.821
- [Sam] That's a good answer.
