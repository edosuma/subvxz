01:08.411 --> 01:10.645
I had to get
your attention somehow.

01:10.647 --> 01:11.846
It's not funny.

01:11.848 --> 01:14.515
Who you texting anyway,
your boyfriend?

01:14.517 --> 01:16.451
Just work stuff.

01:16.453 --> 01:18.419
Eww.
Hey.

01:18.421 --> 01:21.689
You know, someday, you're
gonna have to get a job, too.

01:21.691 --> 01:23.758
Nah. I'll just
get married.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.827
Hi.

01:28.298 --> 01:30.131
Mare, come on.
No chatting.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.666
Say goodbye to your friend.

01:31.668 --> 01:35.002
He's not my friend.
I don't even know him.

01:40.676 --> 01:41.976
Oh, no.
Is this that site

01:41.978 --> 01:45.046
Where it just chooses
who you talk with?

01:45.048 --> 01:47.248
Yeah, hideandgochat.

01:47.250 --> 01:49.884
Yeah, you really
shouldn't be on this site.

01:49.886 --> 01:52.153
It's for people that do gross
things to other people.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.021
People do other things.

01:54.023 --> 01:56.057
Yeah, like what?

01:56.059 --> 01:57.258
I don't know.

01:57.260 --> 01:58.359
Be silly.

01:58.361 --> 01:59.760
Make friends
all over the world.

01:59.762 --> 02:02.163
You know, you can
even meet a cute guy.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.598
Heh. Really?

02:03.600 --> 02:05.333
People use this
to find dates?

02:05.335 --> 02:07.869
Yeah, a lot
of guys do it.

02:07.871 --> 02:09.203
Hmm.

02:09.205 --> 02:10.937
Some of them even do it
with their pants off.

02:10.940 --> 02:13.741
Okay, see, that's why you
shouldn't be on this site.

02:13.743 --> 02:14.942
It's way too sketch.

02:14.944 --> 02:16.110
Totally.

02:16.112 --> 02:17.745
I'm serious, though, mare.
You really

02:17.747 --> 02:19.547
Shouldn't put yourself
out there like that.

02:19.549 --> 02:23.317
What? Like someone's
gonna go smiley on me.

02:24.353 --> 02:25.586
Who?

02:25.588 --> 02:27.989
You know,
the urban legend,

02:27.991 --> 02:29.457
Smiley.

02:29.459 --> 02:32.360
No. Who's that?

02:32.362 --> 02:34.395
You start a video chat
with somebody

02:34.397 --> 02:35.796
Who you don't even know,

02:35.798 --> 02:40.234
And you type in "I did for
the lulz" three times.

02:40.236 --> 02:45.773
And then this guy with a
knife appears behind them.

02:47.276 --> 02:49.343
And what?

02:50.879 --> 02:52.647
They die.

02:55.918 --> 02:58.352
Why do they
call him smiley?

02:58.354 --> 03:00.955
Because he stitched
his eyes shut

03:00.957 --> 03:04.225
And carved a smile
onto his face.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.230
Okay.

03:09.232 --> 03:12.166
You need to stop
being creepy right now.

03:12.168 --> 03:13.634
But it's fun!

03:13.636 --> 03:15.036
That doesn't
even make sense,

03:15.038 --> 03:18.239
'cause how can
one person, smiley,

03:18.241 --> 03:20.908
Just show up behind people
all over the Internet?

03:20.910 --> 03:23.477
You'd be surprised.

03:23.479 --> 03:24.478
I think that's

03:24.480 --> 03:26.948
Just--
crazy!

03:26.950 --> 03:28.482
What's crazy, daddy?

03:28.484 --> 03:30.151
That you're still up. Go.

03:30.153 --> 03:31.152
Go brush your teeth.

03:31.154 --> 03:33.955
Go to bed, you,
before I get you.

03:33.957 --> 03:37.258
I'm sorry
that I was late.

03:37.260 --> 03:41.662
Um, would
a check be okay?

04:45.962 --> 04:47.361
Shush.

04:57.139 --> 04:59.407
Hello?

07:18.647 --> 07:21.449
Wow. It's big.

07:21.451 --> 07:23.017
Yeah.

07:23.019 --> 07:24.785
Sure you're
gonna be okay here?

07:24.787 --> 07:25.886
Mm-hmm.

07:25.888 --> 07:27.421
You can still
stay at the college

07:27.423 --> 07:28.422
If you like.
Dad.

07:28.424 --> 07:29.423
Hmph.

07:30.859 --> 07:32.159
Got everything
you need?

07:32.161 --> 07:33.294
I think so.

07:33.296 --> 07:34.562
Need some money?

07:34.564 --> 07:36.063
Dad, you give me
plenty as it is.

07:36.065 --> 07:37.798
I know, but I just want to
make sure that you're okay.

07:37.800 --> 07:41.168
I promise, I'm fine.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.136
I know.

07:42.138 --> 07:44.071
But if you need
another year at home--

07:44.073 --> 07:46.941
It won't be
like last time.

07:46.943 --> 07:48.676
I'm ready
for this now.

07:48.678 --> 07:50.110
Yeah, I know.

07:50.112 --> 07:53.314
Look at you,
all grown-up.

07:53.316 --> 07:56.217
You're sure you don't want to
be closer to your classes?

07:56.219 --> 07:59.186
Daddy, campus is
literally a block away.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.689
You don't have
to worry so much.

08:01.691 --> 08:02.990
Well, I'm a father.

08:02.992 --> 08:05.259
I--it's part of my job.

08:05.261 --> 08:06.994
Daddy.

08:08.096 --> 08:09.363
Hey.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.234
We're both
gonna be okay.

08:14.569 --> 08:15.736
Okay?

08:15.738 --> 08:17.438
Okay.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.740
We got this.

08:19.742 --> 08:21.342
I love you.

08:21.344 --> 08:22.676
I love you back.

08:23.946 --> 08:25.546
Get in there.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.548
Text me if you
need anything!

08:27.550 --> 08:29.250
I think I'll just call.

08:29.252 --> 08:32.285
Probably a good idea.

08:37.893 --> 08:39.994
Proxy, this house
is so nice.

08:39.996 --> 08:42.462
Thanks for picking me.
Hey.

08:42.465 --> 08:45.099
Hey, I was just psyched
to meet someone normal

08:45.101 --> 08:46.634
When my roommate bailed.

08:46.636 --> 08:48.402
You know, it's weird.
There's so much online,

08:48.404 --> 08:50.337
I kind of feel like
I already know you.

08:50.339 --> 08:52.773
It's just so cool
that your parents

08:52.775 --> 08:54.174
Bought this house
for you.

08:54.176 --> 08:55.609
Um, my parents
bought it four years ago,

08:55.611 --> 08:57.511
And they can't sell it,
so might as well

08:57.513 --> 09:00.281
Have your daughter live in it instead
of paying dorm fees, I guess.

09:00.283 --> 09:02.283
Yeah, I really didn't
want to live in a dorm.

09:02.285 --> 09:04.018
Yeah, they're small.
They're gross.

09:04.020 --> 09:06.220
Dorm parties suck.
Speaking of which,

09:06.222 --> 09:08.756
Um, I have a party
to get to.

09:08.758 --> 09:12.393
Well, it's actually kind of more
of like a little get-together.

09:12.395 --> 09:13.994
Hey, I mean, you wouldn't--

09:13.996 --> 09:16.030
You wouldn't want
to come with, would you?

09:16.032 --> 09:18.699
Isn't it a school night?

09:20.035 --> 09:22.536
Oh. Yeah, it's college.

09:22.538 --> 09:25.005
I can
do whatever I want.

09:26.275 --> 09:29.109
Yes, I accept
your invitation.

09:30.712 --> 09:33.080
Lovely.

09:34.950 --> 09:37.217
Is, like, everybody
at this party?

09:37.219 --> 09:39.153
Mm, probably. But, um,

09:39.155 --> 09:41.355
It's not exactly
a college party, though.

09:41.357 --> 09:42.723
It's just across campus.

09:42.725 --> 09:44.959
Oh. Is it
some friends of yours?

09:44.961 --> 09:46.460
Wait. Am I
too dressed up?

09:46.462 --> 09:48.295
No. No, no, no.
Don't worry.

09:48.297 --> 09:51.098
You're cool. I don't know all
these people either, so...

09:51.100 --> 09:52.333
You don't?

09:52.335 --> 09:54.501
Did you hear about
the party or something?

09:54.503 --> 09:56.870
Wait. Do you think
we can get in?

09:56.872 --> 09:58.305
Is it safe?
No!

09:58.307 --> 09:59.506
Look,
I know them, okay?

09:59.508 --> 10:01.241
I just haven't
met them in person.

10:01.243 --> 10:02.776
This guy from "b"
invited LA people

10:02.778 --> 10:03.944
To his house
for a meet-up.

10:03.946 --> 10:06.413
What's bee?

10:06.415 --> 10:08.882
You know,
the "b" board on 4chan.

10:08.884 --> 10:11.552
Is that like
an Asian dating site?

10:11.554 --> 10:12.553
What?!

10:12.555 --> 10:15.222
Oh, my God, that sounded
totally racist.

10:15.224 --> 10:16.824
Oh, my God. You rule.

10:16.826 --> 10:20.494
Um, I might need to get
stoned to explain this.

10:20.496 --> 10:21.562
Do you smoke pot?

10:21.564 --> 10:25.299
Oh, uh, I was kind of
a dork in high school.

10:25.301 --> 10:28.869
Oh, but you're
in college now.

10:28.871 --> 10:31.605
I can do whatever I want.

10:31.607 --> 10:33.941
Yeah.

10:33.943 --> 10:36.276
Oh, my God, pusher.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.179
As I was saying,
grandma,

10:39.181 --> 10:41.315
"b" is
an image board

10:41.317 --> 10:44.051
Where people can
communicate anonymously.

10:50.325 --> 10:52.226
And what do people
do anonymously?

10:52.228 --> 10:53.694
Oh, very
important things,

10:53.696 --> 10:56.830
Like post gross,
but hilarious pictures,

10:56.832 --> 10:59.066
Plan raids,
troll scientology,

10:59.068 --> 11:00.534
Make memes,
and in general

11:00.536 --> 11:02.803
Do anything necessary
for the lulz.

11:04.906 --> 11:07.675
I think I'm high
on your marijuana.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.381
Give me my marijuana.

11:14.383 --> 11:17.551
Ooh, I hope there's some
hot guys at this party.

11:17.553 --> 11:18.519
I like nerdy guys.

11:18.521 --> 11:20.254
Obviously you
like nerdy guys.

11:20.256 --> 11:21.989
Wait. Jacket on or off?

11:21.991 --> 11:23.657
Off. Ready?

11:23.659 --> 11:24.725
Yeah.

11:30.599 --> 11:31.632
You okay?

11:31.634 --> 11:35.135
Hey, uh, what's up,
superhot ladies?

11:35.137 --> 11:36.770
What's up?

11:36.772 --> 11:39.807
Heh heh. I'm guessing
one of you is proxy?

11:39.809 --> 11:41.408
Yeah?
Yeah.

11:41.410 --> 11:43.110
Yeah.
What's up, Zane?

11:43.112 --> 11:45.045
Zane, yeah.

11:45.047 --> 11:46.613
Who's your
smoking friend?

11:46.615 --> 11:49.216
Hey. I'm Ashley.

11:49.218 --> 11:51.051
Ashley. Nice.

11:51.053 --> 11:54.021
Uh, I'm used to living
alone, or else I'd suggest

11:54.023 --> 11:55.789
<i>A three's company
kind of thing.</i>

11:55.791 --> 11:57.157
There's plenty
of room,

11:57.159 --> 11:58.992
Especially
in my bedroom.

11:58.994 --> 12:01.195
Yeah.

12:03.698 --> 12:05.299
Whoa.

12:07.502 --> 12:09.436
Cool.

12:10.472 --> 12:12.406
Oh, so, uh,

12:12.408 --> 12:14.408
You enjoy
the strange?

12:14.410 --> 12:17.478
Yeah, I enjoy
the strange.

12:18.981 --> 12:20.447
I just smoked pot.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.149
Did that come out right?

12:22.151 --> 12:24.651
Yeah, it did.

12:24.653 --> 12:27.654
No, I enjoy the strange,
because it's, uh,

12:27.656 --> 12:30.257
Interesting and
often retarded.

12:30.259 --> 12:32.426
That's kind of my
special research area,

12:32.428 --> 12:37.464
The intersection of the
strange and retarded.

12:37.466 --> 12:40.267
That would make
a really good soap opera,

12:40.269 --> 12:41.835
<i>The strange
and the retarded.</i>

12:41.837 --> 12:44.905
"And these are the days of our
strange and retarded lives."

12:47.009 --> 12:48.942
No, but, uh, really,
what I'm interested in

12:48.944 --> 12:51.245
Is how people start believing
in things, you know?

12:51.247 --> 12:53.614
Like, uh, bigfoot,
for example.

12:53.616 --> 12:56.617
You know, there's no evidence
that bigfoot exists,

12:56.619 --> 12:59.953
Yet lots of people
believe in bigfoot.

12:59.955 --> 13:00.954
Chupacabra.
Sure.

13:00.956 --> 13:02.422
Sure.
Or how 'bout God?

13:02.424 --> 13:04.391
I mean, millions of
people go to church,

13:04.393 --> 13:05.959
And there's more
evidence for chupacabra.

13:05.961 --> 13:10.831
So is God strange
or retarded?

13:10.833 --> 13:12.566
Hmm.

13:12.568 --> 13:13.433
Hmm.

13:13.435 --> 13:15.135
Let's take acid
and discuss.

13:15.137 --> 13:17.171
But first
I need another beer.

13:17.173 --> 13:18.806
Uh, get drunk now,
three-way later?

13:18.808 --> 13:19.807
Sound good? Yeah.

13:22.877 --> 13:25.012
What the?

13:25.014 --> 13:26.180
Oh, hey.

13:26.182 --> 13:29.082
Hey, I think I saw
that guy on campus.

13:29.084 --> 13:31.051
Ashley:
Oh. Should we say hi?

13:31.053 --> 13:33.387
You should say hi.

13:33.389 --> 13:35.956
Go. Go.
I'll be fine. Go.

13:35.958 --> 13:37.491
College party. Go.
Okay.

13:43.264 --> 13:46.433
Hey. I'm Ashley.

13:46.435 --> 13:48.001
Hey.

13:48.003 --> 13:50.370
Um, is this
the anonymous party?

13:50.372 --> 13:53.340
Nobody will say.

13:53.342 --> 13:56.476
Oh. Well, then,
I guess it is, right?

13:56.478 --> 13:58.212
I'm just kidding.

13:58.214 --> 13:59.947
Yeah, it's the
anonymous party.

13:59.949 --> 14:02.783
Yeah. I'm a dork.

14:03.786 --> 14:06.353
Hey. Hey, what's up?
I'm Zane.

14:06.355 --> 14:07.888
What's up?
I'm binder.

14:07.890 --> 14:10.824
Yeah. What are you
doing here, pedobear?

14:12.160 --> 14:14.127
Don't call me that.

14:14.129 --> 14:16.096
Okay? I thought
it would be cool.

14:16.098 --> 14:17.397
Mm.

14:17.399 --> 14:18.966
You're pedobear?

14:18.968 --> 14:21.001
Do you approve
this message?

14:21.003 --> 14:22.436
Bitch tits!

14:22.438 --> 14:25.839
Pedobear!

14:25.841 --> 14:27.074
Guys, come on.

14:27.076 --> 14:28.742
I was just
hanging out, okay?

14:29.878 --> 14:30.677
Why don't you

14:30.679 --> 14:32.079
Get out of here,
pedobear?

14:32.081 --> 14:34.548
No one wants
to hang out with you.

14:34.550 --> 14:36.950
Man: What a fucking tool.

14:38.119 --> 14:40.387
Bye, pedobear.

14:41.923 --> 14:44.558
Yikes.
What was that about?

14:44.560 --> 14:47.594
Ah, he thought some of the stuff
on the board was messed up,

14:47.596 --> 14:48.929
Said he'd report it.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.632
Honestly, some of the stuff
is pretty messed up,

14:51.634 --> 14:54.368
But, uh, it's not smart
to say so.

14:54.370 --> 14:55.369
He seemed nice.

14:55.371 --> 14:57.771
Yeah,
probably too nice.

14:58.574 --> 15:02.042
Dude, it's the tits.

15:02.044 --> 15:04.111
I did it
for the lulz!

15:04.113 --> 15:05.312
What are they saying?

15:06.748 --> 15:07.814
Check it out.

15:12.687 --> 15:14.021
What is this?

15:14.023 --> 15:15.455
Hideandgochat.

15:15.457 --> 15:17.457
It's video chat,
like Skype,

15:17.459 --> 15:20.193
But you don't know who
you're chatting with.

15:20.195 --> 15:22.396
Why would you chat
with strangers?

15:22.398 --> 15:23.630
Isn't that dumb?

15:23.632 --> 15:25.999
Does this
look dumb to you?

15:46.654 --> 15:47.788
Really?

15:47.790 --> 15:49.623
Really?

15:49.625 --> 15:51.158
Ashley:
What was that?

15:51.160 --> 15:52.392
What, you've never
seen that?

15:52.394 --> 15:53.694
"I did it for the lulz."

15:53.696 --> 15:55.429
That's smiley.
Who?

15:55.431 --> 15:56.697
It's not real,
though, right?

15:56.699 --> 15:58.198
Well, nobody knows
if it's real.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.399
It's on the Internet.

16:00.568 --> 16:01.601
It's like
bloody Mary, okay?

16:01.603 --> 16:02.936
It's an urban legend.

16:02.938 --> 16:05.372
You type "I did it
for the lulz" three times

16:05.374 --> 16:06.773
Across from someone
you're chatting with,

16:06.775 --> 16:08.709
And then smiley
creeps into frame,

16:08.711 --> 16:10.711
And he kills them!
Heh heh.

16:10.713 --> 16:12.846
"I did it
for the" what?

16:12.848 --> 16:14.448
Lulz! Laughs.
I did it just--

16:14.450 --> 16:16.049
I did it just because.
It's like--

16:16.051 --> 16:19.152
Do you know when you do
something just because you can

16:19.154 --> 16:21.121
Or you're bored
or whatever?

16:21.123 --> 16:23.256
Anyway, don't worry.
That video's totally fake.

16:23.258 --> 16:25.859
Really?
Yeah. Yeah.

16:25.861 --> 16:29.162
'Cause that's so freaky.

16:29.164 --> 16:30.397
Raah!

16:31.400 --> 16:33.433
You got me.
Yeah, I did.

16:33.435 --> 16:35.369
I did it
for the lulz.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.468
Oh, my God.

17:41.470 --> 17:43.103
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

18:03.825 --> 18:07.794
This class is an introduction
to reason and ethics.

18:10.398 --> 18:12.132
Well, good morning.
How are you?

18:12.134 --> 18:13.200
Come on in, please.

18:13.202 --> 18:15.268
Have a seat.

18:15.270 --> 18:16.503
Make yourself
comfortable.

18:16.505 --> 18:18.705
I'm gonna stay here.

18:18.707 --> 18:20.440
Great.
As you guys know,

18:20.442 --> 18:22.075
That this class
is a requirement.

18:22.077 --> 18:28.081
Now, aside from my
brilliance and my charisma

18:28.083 --> 18:31.318
And the, uh, school's
obvious huge budget...

18:31.320 --> 18:32.652
Do you have a pencil?

18:32.654 --> 18:34.354
And some of the
technical equipment...

18:34.356 --> 18:35.422
Thanks.

18:35.424 --> 18:36.756
Why do you think
this class is--

18:36.758 --> 18:38.125
You smell better
than I do.

18:38.127 --> 18:39.259
Excuse me. Excuse me.

18:39.261 --> 18:42.295
What--what is your name?

18:42.297 --> 18:43.430
Mark.
Mark.

18:43.432 --> 18:45.632
Okay, mark,
could you please tell me

18:45.634 --> 18:48.635
Why do you think this
class is a requirement?

18:48.637 --> 18:52.606
Um, because we
have to take it?

18:53.642 --> 18:55.142
Okay, all right,
all right.

18:55.144 --> 18:56.676
Hold on a second.
Don't laugh at mark.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.145
All right, now what
is going on here?

18:58.147 --> 19:01.181
Now, why can't, "because
we have to take it,"

19:01.183 --> 19:04.317
Be the reason that this class
is a requirement? Why?

19:07.088 --> 19:09.556
Yes, my sweet latecomer.

19:09.558 --> 19:12.926
Because they're just different
ways of saying the same thing.

19:12.928 --> 19:14.427
Exactly.

19:14.429 --> 19:17.531
They are what
we will learn to call

19:17.533 --> 19:19.499
Equivalent statements.

19:19.501 --> 19:22.469
Neither supports
nor follows the other.

19:22.471 --> 19:23.937
Now, as you guys
get more comfortable

19:23.939 --> 19:26.973
With the keys
of logic and reason,

19:26.975 --> 19:30.777
You're gonna find that they'll
open up just about any box.

19:30.779 --> 19:33.480
Open your books
to page, uh, 29.

19:33.482 --> 19:35.348
29. No, that's just--

19:35.350 --> 19:37.317
That's just
a picture of me.

19:41.789 --> 19:43.089
Professor Clayton.

19:43.091 --> 19:44.925
Oh, girl who was late.

19:44.927 --> 19:46.259
I'm so sorry.
Ashley Brooks.

19:46.261 --> 19:47.594
I promise
I will never--

19:47.596 --> 19:49.462
No, just kidding.
Half the people in this class

19:49.464 --> 19:50.797
Are gonna drop out
once they realize

19:50.799 --> 19:51.831
That reading is involved.

19:51.833 --> 19:53.466
Oh, well,
I was wondering

19:53.468 --> 19:55.535
Whether I could get all the
semester's assignments early?

19:55.537 --> 19:56.670
Why? You leaving town?
No.

19:56.672 --> 19:58.805
I just like to be
really prepared.

20:02.276 --> 20:04.477
Are you hitting on me?

20:04.479 --> 20:05.512
What? No.

20:05.514 --> 20:07.247
I wanted
to know about--

20:10.252 --> 20:11.585
You're joking.

20:11.587 --> 20:13.987
Oh, no. No, that--

20:13.989 --> 20:15.889
ah, yeah.

20:15.891 --> 20:17.390
Nothing gets past you,
Ms. Brooks.

20:17.392 --> 20:19.492
Ah, you know what? All the
assignments on the website.

20:19.494 --> 20:20.827
All right. Okay.
Okay. Thanks.

20:20.829 --> 20:22.395
Do yourself a favor,
though, okay?

20:22.397 --> 20:24.664
You don't have to do all
your homework in one night.

20:24.666 --> 20:25.665
Just relax, okay?
It's college.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.667
Have a good time, okay?

20:38.146 --> 20:40.814
Oh, what's up,
party monster?

20:40.816 --> 20:42.649
Everything is
still spinning.

20:42.651 --> 20:43.750
Is that normal?

20:43.752 --> 20:45.485
I don't know
what got into you.

20:45.487 --> 20:46.920
Oh, God.

20:46.922 --> 20:48.855
Did I do something crazy?

20:48.857 --> 20:50.890
Uh, well, if belting out
Taylor swift lyrics

20:50.892 --> 20:52.892
At the top
of your lungs in front

20:52.894 --> 20:56.062
Of a bunch of 4chan nerds
is crazy, then yes.

20:56.064 --> 20:57.430
Oh, my God.
That's so embarrassing.

20:57.432 --> 20:58.598
No, don't worry, okay?

20:58.600 --> 21:00.433
No one's even
gonna remember that,

21:00.435 --> 21:02.902
Because there's
a new video.

21:02.904 --> 21:04.838
What?

21:09.744 --> 21:12.379
Are those juicy
Booty shorts?

21:12.381 --> 21:14.214
Oh, my God,
his forehead.

21:14.216 --> 21:16.216
That is from last night.
What's that guy's name again?

21:16.218 --> 21:18.418
I don't know. Is that
a mole on your face,

21:18.420 --> 21:19.586
Or is that a herpes?

21:19.588 --> 21:20.820
I don't know.
They put something

21:20.822 --> 21:22.589
Right there on my face.
I don't know.

21:22.591 --> 21:24.424
What--what's it say?

21:26.727 --> 21:28.828
Oh, my God.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.297
There's no way, right?

21:30.299 --> 21:32.465
No way it's real?
Or no way it's fake?

21:32.467 --> 21:33.800
I don't know.

21:33.802 --> 21:35.368
Can't you call somebody?

21:35.370 --> 21:38.571
None of us even know
each other's real names,

21:38.573 --> 21:41.408
But he hasn't
been online, so...

21:41.410 --> 21:42.475
What do
other people think?

21:42.477 --> 21:43.810
About half and half.

21:43.812 --> 21:45.345
Well, did anyone
call the police?

21:45.347 --> 21:47.714
And say what? That there's
some Internet video

21:47.716 --> 21:49.282
Of some guy
getting killed?

21:49.284 --> 21:50.517
Yes. If this is real,

21:50.519 --> 21:52.319
Oh, my God,
this is so sick.

21:52.321 --> 21:53.820
"Hi. Police?

21:53.822 --> 21:56.489
"Yeah, there's an Internet video
of some guy getting killed.

21:56.491 --> 21:57.490
"Oh, no, sorry.

21:57.492 --> 21:58.825
"I don't know his name,

21:58.827 --> 22:01.094
"but, um, he plays pranks
on the Internet,

22:01.096 --> 22:02.362
"and there's
this urban legend that says

22:02.364 --> 22:04.297
"if you type
'I did it for the lulz'

22:04.299 --> 22:05.999
"3 times in a chat,
this guy smiley

22:06.001 --> 22:07.534
Appears behind
the other person and..."

22:07.536 --> 22:09.669
Okay.

22:09.671 --> 22:11.838
So it has
to be fake.

22:12.973 --> 22:13.907
Duh.

22:13.909 --> 22:16.376
How would smiley
know where you are?

22:18.079 --> 22:19.746
Right?

22:19.748 --> 22:21.381
Right. Yep.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.917
I mean, they're all just waiting
to see who falls for it.

22:23.919 --> 22:25.285
We're way too smart
for that.

22:25.287 --> 22:26.353
Yeah, stupid trolls.

22:26.355 --> 22:28.488
Heh. Oh, God,
I'm so glad you came home.

22:28.490 --> 22:30.557
That was kind of
freaking me out.

22:30.559 --> 22:34.294
Hey, you know, I know how
we could find out for real.

22:36.997 --> 22:38.198
What?

22:40.167 --> 22:42.268
Try to do it?

22:43.738 --> 22:44.938
No way.
That's so spooky.

22:44.940 --> 22:47.440
No, it's not.
Okay, we just do it.

22:47.442 --> 22:50.377
Nothing happens, and
then we know it's fake.

22:50.379 --> 22:51.478
Because that way,

22:51.480 --> 22:54.247
We'll know it's fake
for sure, huh?

22:54.249 --> 22:55.515
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

22:55.517 --> 22:57.817
What are they
called again?

22:57.819 --> 22:59.319
Lulz, l-u-l-z,

22:59.321 --> 23:03.123
Like lols, like lolcats,
but lulz.

23:04.593 --> 23:08.194
Mm. Ah, no.

23:08.196 --> 23:10.463
Waah.

23:10.465 --> 23:11.498
Mm...

23:11.500 --> 23:12.899
Maybe.

23:12.901 --> 23:14.901
Don't want to waste it.
Keep going. Keep going.

23:14.903 --> 23:17.003
Mm.
Oh, he's kind of cute.

23:17.005 --> 23:19.038
Mm, yeah, super cute.
Total babe.

23:19.040 --> 23:20.373
Don't kill him.
Okay.

23:20.375 --> 23:21.608
Enh, no.

23:21.610 --> 23:23.943
Ahh! Penis!

23:23.945 --> 23:25.845
Hi, tiny and kind of bent.

23:25.847 --> 23:27.747
Hope you like
touching that thing,

23:27.749 --> 23:29.015
'cause no one else
is gonna do it.

23:29.017 --> 23:30.183
"Next" him.
Wait, wait.

23:30.185 --> 23:32.218
Wait, maybe should
we kill him instead.

23:32.220 --> 23:34.020
Let me do it.
Maybe smiley

23:34.022 --> 23:36.156
Will come out and
cut off his wiener.

23:36.158 --> 23:36.956
"Wiener"?

23:36.958 --> 23:38.425
Heh. I think
you mean penis.

23:38.427 --> 23:39.993
You can't joke around,
though, okay?

23:39.995 --> 23:41.828
You have to really
want it to happen.

23:41.830 --> 23:43.329
Yeah, okay, okay.
I want it to happen.

23:43.331 --> 23:45.298
Picture it.
You have to picture it.

23:46.333 --> 23:47.834
Okay.

23:52.239 --> 23:54.574
Okay.

23:54.576 --> 23:56.876
Give me the keyboard.

24:02.450 --> 24:05.418
Right.

24:18.700 --> 24:20.533
Yeah, right.
As if.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.867
He--he can see us!

24:53.869 --> 24:56.002
"Next" him!
"Next" him! "Next" him!

24:56.871 --> 24:59.138
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?!

24:59.140 --> 25:01.007
I don't know. Did we
just kill somebody?

25:01.009 --> 25:02.342
Did I just
kill somebody?!

25:02.344 --> 25:04.110
I don't know.
Where did he come from?

25:04.112 --> 25:05.445
I don't know, okay?
I don't know.

25:05.447 --> 25:07.580
I thought college
was gonna be fun.

25:07.582 --> 25:09.883
If that really just happened,
smiley can't know where we are.

25:09.885 --> 25:11.284
But he saw us. I mean,
he looked right at us.

25:11.286 --> 25:12.452
He doesn't know
where we are.

25:12.454 --> 25:14.320
But he saw our faces,
and, oh, my God,

25:14.322 --> 25:16.823
He waved at us.
And that doesn't matter.

25:16.825 --> 25:18.024
He has no clue
where we are.

25:18.026 --> 25:20.159
He can't find out
from the computer?

25:20.161 --> 25:21.661
No, absolutely not, okay?

25:21.663 --> 25:23.563
The hideandgochat servers
are completely anonymized.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.064
That's the whole point.
They're set up

25:25.066 --> 25:26.900
So not even your root
can find the IP.

25:26.902 --> 25:28.034
I don't know
what that means.

25:28.036 --> 25:29.636
Trust me. It's good.

25:29.638 --> 25:31.170
Okay, okay.

25:31.172 --> 25:32.472
So we report this,
tell the police

25:32.474 --> 25:34.507
What we saw.
No, no, no, did. No, saw.

25:34.509 --> 25:36.042
No.
Why not?!

25:36.044 --> 25:37.677
Because if we report this,
there's gonna be press.

25:37.679 --> 25:39.846
If it's real, it's gonna
lead him right to us.

25:39.848 --> 25:41.347
He does know
what we look like.

25:42.816 --> 25:44.584
What about the FBI
or something?

25:44.586 --> 25:46.853
No. Ashley,
we can't do that, okay?

25:46.855 --> 25:48.488
We can't tell anybody
about this.

25:48.490 --> 25:51.057
This never happened.

25:52.861 --> 25:54.527
Oh. It's my dad.

25:54.529 --> 25:56.095
Not a word.

26:02.603 --> 26:03.736
Hi, daddy.

26:03.738 --> 26:04.737
Hi, sweetheart.

26:04.739 --> 26:06.839
How's college life?

26:06.841 --> 26:08.541
It's fine.

26:08.543 --> 26:11.578
I mean, it's okay.

26:11.580 --> 26:13.012
It's good.

26:13.014 --> 26:14.280
I'm having fun.

26:14.282 --> 26:17.617
Well, not too
much fun, I hope.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.452
No.

26:19.454 --> 26:21.554
You sound a little
funny, sweetheart.

26:21.556 --> 26:22.488
Everything's fine.

26:22.490 --> 26:24.424
I'm sorry
I haven't called.

26:24.426 --> 26:25.425
I just...

26:28.629 --> 26:31.264
I was just watching a
scary movie with proxy,

26:31.266 --> 26:34.667
And I-I'm still trying to
get it out of my head.

26:34.669 --> 26:35.935
Everything's good.

26:35.937 --> 26:37.236
Is this a bad time?
I mean,

26:37.238 --> 26:39.072
Do you want to get
back to your movie?

26:39.074 --> 26:41.307
No! I mean...

26:41.309 --> 26:43.476
No.

26:43.478 --> 26:46.846
Now's a good time.
I'm out on the patio.

26:46.848 --> 26:50.083
You still sound
kind of funny, hon.

26:50.085 --> 26:53.152
Must be a bad connection.

26:54.555 --> 26:56.089
Okay.

26:56.091 --> 26:59.192
But I do want you to
know that if you just...

26:59.194 --> 27:02.528
Feel like you're not ready
to be out on your own,

27:02.530 --> 27:04.998
You know, you can
always come home.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.566
Thanks, daddy.

27:12.172 --> 27:14.574
I just miss mom.

27:15.676 --> 27:17.543
Yeah.

27:17.545 --> 27:19.946
Yeah, so do I, baby.

27:19.948 --> 27:23.316
I wish we could just
call her up, you know,

27:23.318 --> 27:25.685
Hear her voice
one more time.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.153
Yeah.

27:29.323 --> 27:31.491
Me, too.

27:31.493 --> 27:34.060
It's just hard,
you know.

27:35.729 --> 27:39.766
But I promise I'm fine
most of the time.

27:40.869 --> 27:42.468
Ohh! Um...

27:42.470 --> 27:44.203
Proxy's ready
to keep watching,

27:44.205 --> 27:47.507
So I'll call you
later, okay? Bye.

27:49.276 --> 27:51.310
I didn't tell.
Good.

27:53.881 --> 27:57.450
Now, who could
tell me what we mean

27:57.452 --> 28:00.386
By "the scientific method"?

28:00.388 --> 28:01.387
Mark.

28:01.389 --> 28:06.392
It's like you make
a hypothesis...

28:06.394 --> 28:07.960
No, that's true.
Please, mark,

28:07.962 --> 28:09.328
Stop--stop being right
so often,

28:09.330 --> 28:11.664
And give some of the
other students a chance.

28:11.666 --> 28:12.632
Yes, it's true.

28:12.634 --> 28:14.400
The first step
in the scientific method

28:14.402 --> 28:16.135
Is forming a hypothesis.

28:16.137 --> 28:17.770
So what's a hypothesis?

28:17.772 --> 28:18.938
Maria.

28:18.940 --> 28:20.907
It's like what
you think is true.

28:20.909 --> 28:22.809
Yes. Now that we
have this notion

28:22.811 --> 28:26.212
Of what we think is true,
what do we do next?

28:26.214 --> 28:27.580
I test it, girl.

28:28.583 --> 28:29.782
Exactly.

28:29.784 --> 28:30.983
You test it.

28:30.985 --> 28:33.453
This man is
a closet scientist.

28:33.455 --> 28:35.722
All right, so what
do we do now? Ashley.

28:37.891 --> 28:42.729
Um, what if you test your
hypothesis and it's wrong?

28:42.731 --> 28:44.597
That's fine.
Happens all the time.

28:44.599 --> 28:48.167
You add that result
to your observations.

28:48.169 --> 28:49.635
You revise your hypothesis.

28:49.637 --> 28:51.537
No. I mean...

28:51.539 --> 28:53.940
What if you test
your hypothesis

28:53.942 --> 28:56.142
And something
impossible happens?

28:56.144 --> 28:59.612
Hmm. What do you mean,
impossible?

29:01.215 --> 29:03.049
Nothing.
It's stupid.

29:03.051 --> 29:05.284
I'm sure it's not.

29:05.286 --> 29:06.919
Like supernatural?

29:06.921 --> 29:09.288
Like ghosts?

29:11.693 --> 29:13.626
I don't think we're gonna
settle the ghost question,

29:13.628 --> 29:16.863
But I want to talk about
how the curiosity

29:16.865 --> 29:19.265
And skepticism embodied
in the scientific method

29:19.267 --> 29:21.000
Have applications
beyond the laboratory

29:21.002 --> 29:24.871
And their opposite,
ideology.

29:24.873 --> 29:28.174
We can call ideology
the complete confidence

29:28.176 --> 29:30.943
In what we think
we know, and as such,

29:30.945 --> 29:33.679
It is the end
of critical thinking

29:33.681 --> 29:34.747
And not in a good way.

29:34.749 --> 29:36.449
The worst things
that happen in the world

29:36.451 --> 29:40.820
Are done by people who are
sure that they are right.

29:40.822 --> 29:43.790
Hitler, Stalin, mao,

29:43.792 --> 29:45.758
Pol pot, bin laden,

29:45.760 --> 29:49.362
These are people who believe that
they have some special knowledge

29:49.364 --> 29:52.698
And that this gives them
license to do anything

29:52.700 --> 29:55.768
Because they can.

29:57.204 --> 29:59.906
Now, provided any of you
are still awake,

29:59.908 --> 30:04.677
Would you please turn your books
to the bottom of page 256?

30:41.149 --> 30:42.648
Oh, I'm so sorry.

30:42.650 --> 30:43.649
Uh, sorry.

30:49.189 --> 30:50.823
Binder, right?

30:50.825 --> 30:51.791
Yeah.

30:51.793 --> 30:54.026
We met at that,
uh, party last night.

30:54.028 --> 30:55.027
Right.

30:55.029 --> 30:57.163
Ashley.

30:57.165 --> 30:58.998
I remember.

31:01.602 --> 31:04.003
Can I talk to you
about something?

31:04.005 --> 31:05.238
Me?

31:05.240 --> 31:07.139
Uh, yeah, sure.

31:07.141 --> 31:09.141
Guess I'm
the only one here.

31:09.143 --> 31:10.376
What's up?

31:10.378 --> 31:13.179
What do you know
about smiley?

31:13.181 --> 31:14.513
You mean,
is he real?

31:14.515 --> 31:16.949
Did they send you
here to mess with me?

31:16.951 --> 31:18.584
What?

31:18.586 --> 31:20.653
Well, smiley's part of the
reason they don't like me,

31:20.655 --> 31:23.256
Like when I reported the child
porn they posted on /b/.

31:23.258 --> 31:24.657
I don't know.
I just don't think

31:24.659 --> 31:26.025
Stuff like that
is ever funny.

31:26.027 --> 31:27.059
Because it's not.

31:27.061 --> 31:29.929
But what about smiley?

31:29.931 --> 31:33.099
Well, my theories on him
are kind of weird.

31:33.101 --> 31:35.101
This whole thing
is pretty weird.

31:35.103 --> 31:36.269
Yeah.

31:36.271 --> 31:38.371
Well, I think
smiley's only real

31:38.373 --> 31:40.439
When people
make him real.

31:40.441 --> 31:42.408
Like tinker bell?

31:42.410 --> 31:44.977
Heh. Yeah.

31:44.979 --> 31:48.314
Except it's like all the
evil around the Internet

31:48.316 --> 31:50.182
Found one place
to hide,

31:50.184 --> 31:52.118
You know,
where it's invited,

31:52.120 --> 31:56.022
And then people just made
it become something.

31:56.024 --> 31:57.590
Smiley.

31:57.592 --> 32:00.559
Do you think he's real?

32:00.561 --> 32:02.495
I don't know
if smiley's real.

32:02.497 --> 32:05.298
I mean, I think
the videos are real.

32:05.300 --> 32:07.333
That probably
doesn't make any sense.

32:07.335 --> 32:09.001
No, I think I know
what you mean.

32:11.004 --> 32:12.772
You seem really nice.

32:13.974 --> 32:15.074
You do, too.

32:16.276 --> 32:18.644
Maybe we could...

32:19.880 --> 32:21.080
Be friends?

32:21.082 --> 32:22.782
Yeah.

32:22.784 --> 32:24.750
Yeah.

32:25.619 --> 32:27.787
What's your number?

32:30.958 --> 32:32.425
Uh, okay.

32:38.967 --> 32:40.199
Oh.

32:40.201 --> 32:42.101
That's you.

32:42.103 --> 32:43.636
That's me.
That's you.

32:43.638 --> 32:46.372
Okay, I gotta go, but...

32:46.374 --> 32:47.373
Text me, okay?

32:47.375 --> 32:48.808
Really?

32:48.810 --> 32:50.109
Yeah, really.

32:50.111 --> 32:51.477
Bye.
Bye.

32:51.479 --> 32:53.045
See you later.

32:59.287 --> 33:01.053
Hey.

33:01.055 --> 33:02.355
Where are you going?

33:02.357 --> 33:04.557
There's a big
party night at Zane's.

33:04.559 --> 33:06.892
It's gonna be huge,
and you're coming.

33:08.428 --> 33:10.296
What about what we did...

33:10.298 --> 33:11.630
With smiley?

33:11.632 --> 33:13.899
I don't know what
you're talking about,

33:13.901 --> 33:16.235
Because that never
happened, remember?

33:16.237 --> 33:17.770
Oh. Right. Sorry.

33:17.772 --> 33:20.039
Yeah. Okay,
go get ready, all right?

33:20.041 --> 33:22.641
This'll make us
both forget, I promise.

33:22.643 --> 33:23.609
Okay.

33:23.611 --> 33:24.977
Okay. Just don't dress

33:24.979 --> 33:27.480
Like you're going to
a quinceañera this time.

33:36.356 --> 33:38.157
Whoo Whoo!

33:42.462 --> 33:43.496
Hey, ash, I think--

33:43.498 --> 33:45.164
Ohh! Ohh!

33:45.166 --> 33:48.200
Shit. Oh, shit,
I am so sorry.

33:48.202 --> 33:50.102
Um, the bar here.
Here. Try some.

33:50.104 --> 33:51.404
Oh, I probably
shouldn't.

33:51.406 --> 33:53.873
Ah, come on. Drink it.
It's a free drink.

33:53.875 --> 33:55.508
Okay.

33:55.510 --> 33:56.509
Drink it.

33:56.511 --> 33:57.777
I gotta pee so badly.

33:57.779 --> 34:00.646
Mm. I think there
was a bug in it.

34:00.648 --> 34:02.214
I'm gonna go pee
in a closet.

34:04.385 --> 34:07.153
You're crazy!

34:22.436 --> 34:25.838
"...Did it for the lulz"
three times,

34:25.840 --> 34:29.475
And then smiley came up behind
him, and he killed him.

34:29.476 --> 34:30.842
Nuh-uh.
That sounds crazy.

34:30.844 --> 34:32.812
Are you sure
it's real?

34:49.262 --> 34:51.197
Oh.
Hey, what's up?

34:51.199 --> 34:53.232
Hey, I'm Ashley.

34:53.234 --> 34:54.500
Yeah, yeah, I know.

34:54.502 --> 34:56.335
We, uh--we met
the other night.

34:56.337 --> 34:58.204
You wanted
to have sex with me,

34:58.206 --> 34:59.472
But I wasn't
into it.

34:59.474 --> 35:02.141
What?
Hmm?

35:05.346 --> 35:07.546
I'm sorry
about your friend.

35:07.548 --> 35:09.281
Kells was
your friend, right?

35:11.017 --> 35:12.017
That's...

35:12.019 --> 35:14.019
What? No.

35:14.021 --> 35:16.088
He's not dead.

35:16.090 --> 35:17.189
Are you kidding me?

35:17.191 --> 35:18.357
He's probably just

35:18.359 --> 35:19.825
Pulling a frigging
prank on us. Hello.

35:19.827 --> 35:21.293
They haven't even
found the body.

35:21.295 --> 35:24.029
Well, do you know
where he lives?

35:24.031 --> 35:25.197
I don't know.

35:25.199 --> 35:27.433
Probably
with his moms.

35:27.435 --> 35:28.467
Oh, dude.

35:28.469 --> 35:29.802
You just
come up with that?

35:29.804 --> 35:31.504
So you don't know
if he's alive.

35:31.506 --> 35:34.373
What if this
is really real?

35:34.375 --> 35:37.643
Oh, what if
nothing's real?

35:37.645 --> 35:39.979
<i>Maybe it's the end
of the Truman show</i>

35:39.981 --> 35:42.581
And you both just hit
the sky mural.

35:44.519 --> 35:46.585
"Oh, what's real?
I don't know.

35:46.587 --> 35:49.054
My life is
a show on TV."

35:53.026 --> 35:54.760
Come with me.

35:54.762 --> 35:56.428
What did you see?

35:56.430 --> 35:57.630
Nothing.

35:57.632 --> 35:59.698
Seriously,
what did you see?

35:59.700 --> 36:03.869
I mean, I saw
the video of kells.

36:03.871 --> 36:07.006
Yeah, and he's
fucking dead, right?

36:07.008 --> 36:09.675
I mean,
we're on the same page here.

36:09.677 --> 36:11.610
What else did you see?

36:11.612 --> 36:14.346
Nothing.

36:14.348 --> 36:16.282
I didn't see
anything else.

36:16.284 --> 36:18.651
Are you fucking with me?

36:20.487 --> 36:22.855
You typed it,
and you made it happen.

36:22.857 --> 36:23.889
No.
Yes. You did.

36:23.891 --> 36:26.692
You did it
for the lulz, right?

36:26.694 --> 36:29.128
You called smiley,
and he came.

36:30.764 --> 36:33.632
Okay, look, if it
makes you feel any better...

36:35.035 --> 36:36.101
I did it, too.

36:37.237 --> 36:39.405
I don't even know
who the fuck he killed.

36:39.407 --> 36:40.439
It was just some kid.

36:40.441 --> 36:42.041
He cut him up
like a pig.

36:43.643 --> 36:45.978
God, this can't
be real, right?

36:45.980 --> 36:46.979
It can't.

36:46.981 --> 36:48.647
I mean, God,

36:48.649 --> 36:51.417
I don't even know who these
people are that are my friends,

36:51.419 --> 36:52.551
Just people I know.

36:52.553 --> 36:55.154
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:55.156 --> 36:56.755
Whoa. Hey, hey.
I'm so sorry.

36:56.757 --> 36:59.858
You--you want a bed
or something?

36:59.860 --> 37:01.060
I'm gonna go home.

37:01.062 --> 37:03.529
Do you have a ride?
You want a cab?

37:03.531 --> 37:05.164
Or...

37:07.200 --> 37:09.235
You can sleep over.

37:12.872 --> 37:14.373
I'm gonna walk.

37:14.375 --> 37:18.043
Eh, no, you shouldn't walk
across campus by yourself.

37:18.045 --> 37:20.946
What if he comes for
the people who call him?

37:20.948 --> 37:22.581
Have you thought
about that?

37:33.093 --> 37:34.727
Proxy.

38:34.154 --> 38:35.421
It's nothing.

38:35.423 --> 38:36.488
You're being stupid.

38:36.490 --> 38:37.956
You're just being stupid.

38:43.563 --> 38:47.166
Man: Ashley.

39:26.574 --> 39:28.340
No! Please, no!

39:36.383 --> 39:37.383
Are you okay?

39:37.385 --> 39:39.218
What?

39:39.220 --> 39:41.653
That must have been one gnarly nightmare.
What was it?

39:41.655 --> 39:43.722
Smiley.

39:43.724 --> 39:45.958
Smiley was trying
to kill me.

39:45.960 --> 39:48.260
That sucks. It's like
Freddy Krueger.

39:48.262 --> 39:49.261
What?!

39:49.263 --> 39:50.195
No! Last night,

39:50.197 --> 39:52.231
He was really
trying to kill me!

39:52.233 --> 39:55.367
Dude, what happened
to your shirt?

39:57.972 --> 40:00.706
He--he chased me,
and he caught me.

40:00.708 --> 40:02.307
He ripped my shirt.

40:02.309 --> 40:04.676
I don't think so.

40:04.678 --> 40:07.012
Maybe I--

40:07.014 --> 40:08.247
I left the party.

40:08.249 --> 40:11.283
Um, yeah. I was looking
all over for you.

40:11.285 --> 40:13.786
And then this girl,
she was like, "meh,

40:13.788 --> 40:16.121
She's not in the reh,"

40:16.123 --> 40:18.390
So I got a ride
with them.

40:18.392 --> 40:20.592
Look, this neighborhood isn't
that bad, but you probably

40:20.594 --> 40:22.761
Shouldn't be walking around
by yourself at night.

40:22.763 --> 40:25.063
Proxy!
This actually happened!

40:25.065 --> 40:28.567
I left the party,
and I was pretty buzzed.

40:28.569 --> 40:29.835
I was super wasted.

40:29.837 --> 40:31.336
I mean, how did
I get so wasted?

40:31.338 --> 40:32.838
Mm, I don't know.
And then--

40:32.840 --> 40:34.840
And then I went
across campus,

40:34.842 --> 40:36.108
And he was there.

40:36.110 --> 40:38.310
Well, are you sure
it was him?

40:38.312 --> 40:41.914
Wasn't just
some creepy guy?

40:41.916 --> 40:43.515
He had the fucking face,

40:43.517 --> 40:45.083
And he had the knife,

40:45.085 --> 40:47.920
And he said
my name, proxy.

40:47.922 --> 40:49.955
He knows my name.

40:49.957 --> 40:52.224
But you got away.

40:52.226 --> 40:53.358
No.

40:53.360 --> 40:56.495
But, like,
you're right here,

40:56.497 --> 41:01.467
So, um, news flash, this
didn't happen, Ashley.

41:01.469 --> 41:04.303
Where did you find me?
I found you right here.

41:04.305 --> 41:06.672
I came in your room, and
you were in your bed.

41:06.674 --> 41:07.706
He was in here?!

41:07.708 --> 41:10.275
No. God.

41:10.277 --> 41:11.543
It was just you.

41:11.545 --> 41:13.245
He did this.

41:13.247 --> 41:14.379
Okay.

41:14.381 --> 41:18.884
I think that it was just
a really bad dream.

41:18.886 --> 41:21.253
I mean,
don't get me wrong.

41:22.856 --> 41:25.257
I'm really
freaked out, too.

41:26.560 --> 41:28.861
Okay, what's the last
thing you remember?

41:28.863 --> 41:32.030
Uh, he--

41:33.366 --> 41:35.934
He was...

41:38.605 --> 41:41.073
And I woke up.

41:42.308 --> 41:47.112
Ashley, are you
on any psychiatric meds?

41:47.114 --> 41:48.380
No.

41:51.451 --> 41:52.551
Not anymore.

41:55.955 --> 41:58.490
Have you ever been
on any medication?

41:58.492 --> 42:00.959
Lithium for bipolar.

42:00.961 --> 42:03.028
And when were
you diagnosed?

42:03.030 --> 42:05.030
My senior year
of high school.

42:05.032 --> 42:07.032
I kind of
had a breakdown

42:07.034 --> 42:09.434
After my mom
committed suicide.

42:10.470 --> 42:13.372
Had your mother been
diagnosed as bipolar?

42:13.374 --> 42:18.210
No. Well, I mean,
afterwards.

42:18.212 --> 42:20.312
And why'd you stop
taking the meds?

42:20.314 --> 42:22.848
The lithium made me
so fat and stupid.

42:22.850 --> 42:24.283
I couldn't
remember anything.

42:24.285 --> 42:27.085
But I--I didn't just quit.
I came off it gradually.

42:27.087 --> 42:28.987
Under your doctor's
supervision?

42:28.989 --> 42:30.422
Mm-hmm.

42:30.424 --> 42:32.558
I've been totally
off it for six months.

42:32.560 --> 42:36.461
Okay. Well, what's up?

42:37.830 --> 42:39.231
I'm really anxious.

42:39.233 --> 42:41.767
It is your first week
of college.

42:41.769 --> 42:43.502
Yeah, but...

42:43.504 --> 42:45.637
Really anxious,

42:45.639 --> 42:47.906
Like terrified.

42:47.908 --> 42:49.508
And I feel guilty.

42:49.510 --> 42:51.777
I feel like I've done
something really bad,

42:51.779 --> 42:53.211
But I don't think I have.

42:53.213 --> 42:56.548
Well, in your
first week of school,

42:56.550 --> 43:00.052
You haven't done
something really awful,

43:00.054 --> 43:02.821
Like, say,
killed anyone.

43:02.823 --> 43:05.457
Heh.

43:05.459 --> 43:07.326
No.

43:09.195 --> 43:12.431
But I'm having really
vivid nightmares.

43:12.433 --> 43:14.666
You've been
through a trauma,

43:14.668 --> 43:16.034
Adjusted to it,

43:16.036 --> 43:18.503
And now you're
in a new environment.

43:18.505 --> 43:19.504
It's stressful.

43:21.074 --> 43:22.674
I don't seem crazy?

43:22.676 --> 43:23.942
Crazy?

43:23.944 --> 43:26.712
I'd have to say...

43:26.714 --> 43:28.080
Not at all.

43:28.915 --> 43:32.017
Even though the dreams,

43:32.019 --> 43:35.754
They're really...

43:38.491 --> 43:40.659
They're
really realistic.

43:40.661 --> 43:44.062
Well, that's the nature
of dreams, isn't it?

43:44.064 --> 43:45.664
They seem real
when we're having them.

43:45.666 --> 43:48.333
Otherwise, they'd have
no power over us.

43:48.335 --> 43:50.969
But it sounds like this
anxiety is debilitating.

43:50.971 --> 43:53.105
Yeah.
And you don't want

43:53.107 --> 43:54.840
To go back
on the lithium salts.

43:54.842 --> 43:57.743
Have you ever tried anything
for situational anxiety,

43:57.745 --> 44:00.412
Rather than a sledgehammer
like lithium?

44:00.414 --> 44:02.714
Like what?

44:04.150 --> 44:06.885
I'm gonna write you
a short scrip for ativan.

44:06.887 --> 44:08.787
That sound okay?

44:08.789 --> 44:10.389
Hmm?

44:10.391 --> 44:12.157
Yes.

44:12.159 --> 44:14.760
I just remembered
something.

44:14.762 --> 44:16.495
I'm not crazy.

44:16.497 --> 44:17.429
Okay, good.

44:17.431 --> 44:19.564
That's a good thing
to remember.

44:19.566 --> 44:21.767
I'm gonna give you
this scrip,

44:21.769 --> 44:23.301
And it's not for crazy.

44:23.303 --> 44:24.369
It's for anxiety.

44:27.540 --> 44:28.740
Okay.

44:32.478 --> 44:33.478
Did you tell?

44:33.480 --> 44:34.813
No.

44:34.815 --> 44:36.415
I just remembered.
At the party,

44:36.417 --> 44:37.649
Zane knew-- yeah,
he just called me.

44:37.651 --> 44:39.885
There's another one.
Another what?

44:39.887 --> 44:41.153
Another dead person.

44:41.155 --> 44:43.088
We gotta go
to Zane's.

44:48.728 --> 44:50.395
Ashley.

44:52.031 --> 44:54.199
Okay, what is going on?

44:54.201 --> 44:56.101
I don't know.

44:56.103 --> 44:57.235
What about you?

44:57.237 --> 44:58.970
Huh? You know
what's going on?

44:58.972 --> 45:00.672
Is that a gun?
Yes. Yes.

45:00.674 --> 45:02.140
This--
this is a gun.

45:02.142 --> 45:03.575
Why do you have that?

45:03.577 --> 45:06.144
Because I am
a security professional.

45:06.146 --> 45:07.679
But I thought
you went to college.

45:10.016 --> 45:12.584
Do I really seem
that retarded to you?

45:12.586 --> 45:15.187
What?
College is for retards.

45:15.189 --> 45:17.689
I am a security
professional.

45:17.691 --> 45:19.691
Oh.

45:19.693 --> 45:20.959
Like at the mall?

45:20.961 --> 45:23.562
Fucking fuck, no!
No, no, no!

45:23.564 --> 45:26.064
Like at the mall?
Network security.

45:26.066 --> 45:27.265
What's
network security?

45:27.267 --> 45:29.434
He's a hacker,
okay, like lulzsec,

45:29.436 --> 45:31.169
Like--like anonymous,
like wikileaks,

45:31.171 --> 45:32.237
Like trolling
westboro--

45:32.239 --> 45:33.672
Proxy, will you
shut up, please?

45:33.674 --> 45:35.574
Will you watch the gun?
Please shut up.

45:35.576 --> 45:37.442
She has to understand that to
know what you're talking about.

45:37.444 --> 45:38.877
I don't know what
you're talking about.

45:38.879 --> 45:39.878
He needs some money,

45:39.880 --> 45:41.213
He hacks
a corporate network,

45:41.215 --> 45:43.315
And then says, "hey,
pay me to fix your problem."

45:43.317 --> 45:44.649
That's a network
security professional.

45:44.651 --> 45:46.451
What you're talking
about would be

45:46.453 --> 45:49.454
An illegal
protection racket.

45:49.456 --> 45:52.724
I am one
of a hundred

45:52.726 --> 45:56.728
Or 500 or a thousand
people in the whole world

45:56.730 --> 45:59.064
Who can find out
anything about anyone,

45:59.066 --> 46:02.467
Medical records,
how much money,

46:02.469 --> 46:05.437
Chocolate or vanilla,
top or bottom.

46:05.439 --> 46:09.341
I mean,
and honestly,

46:09.343 --> 46:13.378
I have no idea
what's going on.

46:13.380 --> 46:15.947
I mean,
who's doing this?

46:15.949 --> 46:17.516
We don't know.

46:17.518 --> 46:21.820
Okay, well, why don't
you riddle me this?

46:21.822 --> 46:22.821
Who is she?

46:22.823 --> 46:24.089
Me?

46:24.091 --> 46:25.624
Smiley's trying
to kill me.

46:25.626 --> 46:27.726
"Smiley's trying
to kill me. Ahh."

46:27.728 --> 46:28.727
You're not dead.

46:28.729 --> 46:29.861
You're not dead,

46:29.863 --> 46:31.930
And other
people are.

46:31.932 --> 46:33.698
You want to see
the video

46:33.700 --> 46:36.535
Of smiley slashing
crash's throat?

46:36.537 --> 46:38.570
I could show it
to you if you want.

46:38.572 --> 46:40.572
No.
Proxy?

46:41.574 --> 46:44.442
This shit's
personal, okay?

46:44.444 --> 46:48.113
If this isn't some Internet
hobgoblin fairy tale,

46:48.115 --> 46:49.714
This is one
of our enemies.

46:49.716 --> 46:52.851
Who are your enemies?

46:52.853 --> 46:54.953
Who is not our enemies?

46:54.955 --> 46:58.423
You don't get to be king
of the Internet assholes

46:58.425 --> 47:01.092
Without making
a few enemies,

47:01.094 --> 47:02.093
A shit-ton, in fact.

47:02.095 --> 47:03.094
I mean, it could be--

47:03.096 --> 47:04.696
Could be the--
the Chinese

47:04.698 --> 47:07.098
Or those fucking--
those dicks in Holland.

47:07.100 --> 47:08.266
Remember them?
Yeah.

47:08.268 --> 47:09.734
And, uh, the feds.

47:09.736 --> 47:10.769
Could be the FBI.

47:10.771 --> 47:13.505
I mean, but--
but if it was the FBI,

47:13.507 --> 47:17.209
You know, they'd be--
just knock down the door.

47:17.211 --> 47:19.978
Fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

47:21.314 --> 47:24.783
What if smiley isn't
any of those things?

47:26.319 --> 47:29.621
I mean, what if he's real?

47:29.623 --> 47:31.256
He's definitely
fucking real.

47:31.258 --> 47:32.958
I think we've established
that by now.

47:32.960 --> 47:37.062
No, I mean, what if he's
something we can't understand?

47:37.064 --> 47:40.966
What if he's just evil?

47:43.035 --> 47:45.704
And that evil...

47:45.706 --> 47:47.539
Is hunting us?

47:47.541 --> 47:48.406
Yes.

47:48.408 --> 47:51.710
What if that evil
is hunting us?

47:51.712 --> 47:55.881
Well, then, I'd say that's
pretty fucking bad news.

47:57.617 --> 47:58.950
Shit!

48:00.353 --> 48:02.454
I think I'm gonna go get
my prescription filled.

48:02.456 --> 48:04.422
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

48:04.424 --> 48:06.758
What are
you getting?

48:06.760 --> 48:09.261
Oh, ativan.

48:09.263 --> 48:12.297
Ativan. Um, save me
some of that.

48:12.299 --> 48:14.499
I think we're
gonna need it.

48:22.375 --> 48:24.109
All right,
be careful, ladies.

48:24.111 --> 48:25.710
Yeah. You, too.

48:25.712 --> 48:26.745
Right.

49:47.060 --> 49:48.426
All righty.

49:48.428 --> 49:51.763
Who can tell me
about occam's razor? Yeah?

49:51.765 --> 49:56.735
Uh, "entities must not be
multiplied beyond necessity."

49:56.737 --> 49:59.004
You've done your reading.
That's very good.

49:59.006 --> 50:01.606
Okay, now give it to me
in the plain language, okay?

50:01.608 --> 50:04.142
What did William
of ockham mean? Hmm?

50:04.144 --> 50:05.276
Maria?

50:05.278 --> 50:08.380
Uh, the most likely
explanation

50:08.382 --> 50:10.715
Is usually
the right explanation.

50:10.717 --> 50:13.418
Now, is occam's razor
a rule

50:13.420 --> 50:14.686
Or more of a guideline?

50:14.688 --> 50:16.421
Well, it's a guideline,
because, I mean,

50:16.423 --> 50:20.725
Sometimes the unlikely explanation
is actually the right explanation.

50:20.727 --> 50:25.030
Right, and that brings
us back to something

50:25.032 --> 50:26.865
That, uh, Ashley...

50:26.867 --> 50:27.866
Was asking about

50:27.868 --> 50:30.068
At the end
of the last class.

50:30.070 --> 50:33.571
How do we account for things
that seem so unlikely

50:33.573 --> 50:35.273
As to be impossible?

50:35.275 --> 50:37.308
They do occur.

50:37.310 --> 50:38.810
Like supernatural?

50:38.812 --> 50:40.612
Ah, let me give you
something that's

50:40.614 --> 50:42.614
A little weirder than what
we call supernatural,

50:42.616 --> 50:44.182
Just to, uh,
blow your minds.

50:44.184 --> 50:47.085
Are your minds
ready to blown?

50:48.354 --> 50:49.888
Okay.

50:51.424 --> 50:54.359
Now, we know
that the physical laws

50:54.361 --> 50:58.296
That govern the universe
are specific

50:58.298 --> 51:01.900
And that the tiniest,
most infinitesimal change

51:01.902 --> 51:05.403
In the weight of just one
type of subatomic particle,

51:05.405 --> 51:07.539
Any kind of particle,

51:07.541 --> 51:10.008
Would mean no universe,

51:10.010 --> 51:13.545
No stars, no planets,

51:13.547 --> 51:16.314
No life,
no consciousness,

51:16.316 --> 51:19.284
Us not even having
this conversation.

51:19.286 --> 51:23.755
Unless you believe in a God
whose only reason for being

51:23.757 --> 51:27.125
Is the authorship of a
relatively small book of rules

51:27.127 --> 51:30.462
About the weight and
behavior of particles,

51:30.464 --> 51:32.964
Then we have
to acknowledge

51:32.966 --> 51:35.800
That those rules could have
been anything whatsoever.

51:35.802 --> 51:39.270
Now, what is the implication
of what I just said?

51:39.272 --> 51:40.572
Yeah?

51:40.574 --> 51:42.574
It's almost like
everything that happened

51:42.576 --> 51:45.944
Happened so we could
know it happened.

51:45.946 --> 51:47.078
A-plus.

51:47.080 --> 51:50.381
And that idea is called
the anthropic principle,

51:50.383 --> 51:54.119
That everything happened just so
that we could know it happened,

51:54.121 --> 51:57.856
But there's a problem with the
anthropic principle. Ashley...

51:57.858 --> 52:02.227
What could be wrong
with this idea?

52:02.229 --> 52:04.929
It assumes we're the end.

52:04.931 --> 52:06.297
Yes.

52:06.299 --> 52:08.133
It assumes
we're the reason,

52:08.135 --> 52:11.469
When really we could just
be amoebas or whatever.

52:11.471 --> 52:15.540
Simple forms of life were
necessary for us to develop.

52:16.642 --> 52:18.943
We might be
what's necessary

52:18.945 --> 52:22.147
For something else
to develop.

52:24.450 --> 52:27.719
And I think I'd like
to end it on that.

52:27.721 --> 52:31.055
Humanity may be nothing more
than an intermediate step

52:31.057 --> 52:32.624
In the development
of a consciousness

52:32.626 --> 52:34.792
A trillion times
greater.

52:34.794 --> 52:37.795
We already
built it a network,

52:37.797 --> 52:39.731
Millions of nodes
communicating with each other

52:39.733 --> 52:41.699
That is called
the Internet.

52:41.701 --> 52:44.536
And while each node
on its own

52:44.538 --> 52:46.771
Is nothing more
than a dumb computer,

52:46.773 --> 52:50.575
Please remember that each of
our individual brain cells

52:50.577 --> 52:53.378
Is capable
of far, far less.

52:53.380 --> 52:55.079
<i>Terminator,
like skynet.</i>

52:55.081 --> 52:57.582
<i>Or like the matrix,
like Neo.</i>

52:57.584 --> 53:00.118
I think it's gonna be
a lot stranger

53:00.120 --> 53:02.820
Than anything we're
capable of imagining.

53:02.822 --> 53:05.957
Let's just hope that when
it becomes conscious...

53:07.493 --> 53:09.194
It's nice to us.

53:12.531 --> 53:14.666
Or it could all just be
a bunch of nonsense.

53:14.668 --> 53:16.134
All right,
get out of here.

53:17.203 --> 53:18.870
Have a good day.

53:23.542 --> 53:25.543
Could I speak to you
for a second?

53:25.545 --> 53:27.779
You know what?
I'm kind of in a hurry.

53:27.781 --> 53:29.681
Yeah, but it'll just
take one second.

53:29.683 --> 53:31.716
No, just come during
office hours, okay?

53:31.718 --> 53:33.017
But--
all right.

53:34.420 --> 53:36.354
Okay.

53:51.170 --> 53:52.704
...Baby-sitter Stacy

53:52.706 --> 53:57.675
Hasn't been answering
her calls.

53:57.677 --> 53:59.410
I'm really worried
about her,

53:59.412 --> 54:02.347
Of her getting
killed by smiley.

54:03.482 --> 54:07.785
And nobody believes me.

54:27.606 --> 54:28.973
Binder.

54:28.975 --> 54:30.541
Scared the crap
out of me.

54:30.543 --> 54:32.577
Don't sneak up
on people like that.

54:32.579 --> 54:33.578
Oh, sorry.

54:33.580 --> 54:35.179
What are you doing here?

54:35.181 --> 54:37.515
Oh, I, uh--

54:37.517 --> 54:38.549
I work here.

54:38.551 --> 54:40.084
Oh, in the library?
Yeah.

54:40.086 --> 54:41.519
I manage the
networking databases.

54:41.521 --> 54:42.987
It's how I pay
for school.

54:42.989 --> 54:44.222
You're like
a computer genius.

54:44.224 --> 54:46.057
Uh, yeah, thank you.

54:46.059 --> 54:48.760
I prefer
the term nerd, but...

54:49.561 --> 54:51.095
What are you doing?

54:51.097 --> 54:54.399
You remember saying something
about evil being a force.

54:54.401 --> 54:56.134
Yeah.

54:56.136 --> 54:58.936
Did you
mean that literally?

55:03.142 --> 55:05.143
We're talking about
smiley, right?

55:05.145 --> 55:07.111
Well, I've been
researching it,

55:07.113 --> 55:09.647
And I haven't even had time
to get to this part yet--

55:09.649 --> 55:11.282
Smiley's real.

55:12.318 --> 55:13.918
What?
How do you know?

55:14.820 --> 55:16.487
I killed someone.

55:16.489 --> 55:19.924
Are you serious?
Ah, that's amazing.

55:19.926 --> 55:21.192
I mean, that's terrible,
obviously,

55:21.194 --> 55:23.394
But I tried to do it,
and nothing happened.

55:23.396 --> 55:24.896
Do you want them to die?

55:24.898 --> 55:26.731
No. I mean,
I wanted to be right,

55:26.733 --> 55:28.366
But I didn't want
to kill anybody.

55:28.368 --> 55:29.834
You have
to really want it.

55:29.836 --> 55:31.903
You have to really
want them to die.

55:31.905 --> 55:34.806
But then
he comes after you.

55:34.808 --> 55:37.508
He tried to kill me.

55:37.510 --> 55:39.510
What did it feel like?

55:39.512 --> 55:42.780
What do you mean?
It was horrible.

55:43.649 --> 55:45.783
Wow. Do you know
what this means?

55:45.785 --> 55:47.752
I mean, I thought
I was crazy, but--

55:47.754 --> 55:50.021
But if this is true,
if you're not lying,

55:50.023 --> 55:51.723
Then that means something's
been awakened,

55:51.725 --> 55:53.024
Like something's
been born,

55:53.026 --> 55:54.425
Like smiley could be
the next generation--

55:54.427 --> 55:55.793
Are you not
listening to me?

55:56.929 --> 55:59.263
Smiley's trying
to kill me.

56:00.332 --> 56:02.033
You know...

56:03.001 --> 56:05.303
I thought maybe
you could help.

57:32.558 --> 57:34.058
What are you doing?! Huh?!

57:34.060 --> 57:36.661
What the--are you
trying to get us killed?!

57:36.663 --> 57:38.062
I just--
are you crazy?

57:38.064 --> 57:39.697
No, I just
want it to stop.

57:39.699 --> 57:41.132
Well, then stop
trying to find out

57:41.134 --> 57:42.834
What it is, okay?
You're bringing it to us.

57:42.836 --> 57:44.402
But he won't
leave me alone.

57:44.404 --> 57:46.671
I don't care!
I don't care.

57:46.673 --> 57:48.539
You need to stop.

57:49.608 --> 57:52.043
Crazy bitch.

58:04.189 --> 58:05.890
Hi, sweetheart.

58:05.892 --> 58:07.892
Daddy?

58:11.898 --> 58:13.831
Proxy.
What are you, crazy?

58:13.833 --> 58:16.734
No. No, I'm not crazy. I really
didn't mean to. It was smiley.

58:16.736 --> 58:17.735
Shut up, Ashley.

58:17.737 --> 58:18.803
He was on the phone.

58:18.805 --> 58:21.072
I swear he was
on the phone.

58:23.675 --> 58:25.343
I'm sorry.

58:28.547 --> 58:30.681
I'm sorry.

58:30.683 --> 58:34.018
I'm so sorry.

58:34.020 --> 58:37.054
I know I should have
mentioned something before,

58:37.056 --> 58:39.290
And I know I lied.
I'm just...

58:40.893 --> 58:43.861
I just don't want
to be crazy like my mom.

58:45.031 --> 58:47.265
I'm really happy
I can talk to you,

58:47.267 --> 58:51.002
Because I have
nobody else.

58:51.004 --> 58:54.405
Do you think you're
a danger to yourself?

58:54.407 --> 58:55.706
No.

58:57.209 --> 58:59.744
I don't want to die.

58:59.746 --> 59:01.612
I don't want
anybody to die.

59:01.614 --> 59:05.583
I'm gonna need to see
you again tomorrow.

59:05.585 --> 59:08.519
Between now and then,
I want you to sleep.

59:08.521 --> 59:11.389
I can't sleep.

59:11.391 --> 59:13.925
Even the ativan
won't make me.

59:13.927 --> 59:15.626
I'm gonna give you
a serious tranquilizer.

59:15.628 --> 59:17.328
I'm only gonna
prescribe one dose,

59:17.330 --> 59:20.364
And I don't want you to
mix it with the ativan.

59:20.366 --> 59:21.365
Got it?

59:22.834 --> 59:25.503
You're presenting
as rational,

59:25.505 --> 59:29.106
But what you're saying
makes me very concerned.

59:29.108 --> 59:30.374
The good news

59:30.376 --> 59:33.010
Is that you know
it doesn't make sense,

59:33.012 --> 59:35.246
And that's
why you're here.

59:36.782 --> 59:38.316
Tomorrow, we're
gonna talk about

59:38.318 --> 59:40.518
Checking you in
for another evaluation.

59:41.653 --> 59:44.221
But I--I don't want
to go for another--

59:44.223 --> 59:45.957
We talk about it
tomorrow,

59:45.959 --> 59:48.593
Or we do it today.
Your call.

59:51.863 --> 59:53.598
Okay.

59:57.336 --> 59:59.670
Then I'll see you
tomorrow.

01:00:02.708 --> 01:00:04.408
Okay.

01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:51.756
Yeah.

01:00:51.758 --> 01:00:53.224
Ah, Ms. Brooks.

01:00:53.226 --> 01:00:54.458
You here to hand in

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:55.960
Your next four months
of assignments?

01:00:55.962 --> 01:00:57.662
No. I...

01:00:57.664 --> 01:01:00.498
come on.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.533
So what's up?

01:01:02.535 --> 01:01:06.370
I wanted to know-- you were talking
about in class the other day

01:01:06.372 --> 01:01:07.638
About computers
being conscious.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.306
Do you think
that's really possible?

01:01:10.308 --> 01:01:11.709
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, why not?

01:01:11.711 --> 01:01:14.545
I--frankly, I think
it's more likely

01:01:14.547 --> 01:01:16.747
That we'll all
just kill each other

01:01:16.749 --> 01:01:18.883
Before something that
interesting occurs, but yeah.

01:01:18.885 --> 01:01:20.551
You mean with
nuclear weapons?

01:01:20.553 --> 01:01:22.420
Or bioweapons
or nanomachines

01:01:22.422 --> 01:01:24.221
Or just plain old
resource depletion

01:01:24.223 --> 01:01:28.092
Until we finally achieve total
extinction of all complex life, yeah.

01:01:28.094 --> 01:01:29.660
But why would we
want to do that?

01:01:29.662 --> 01:01:30.594
Want to do it?

01:01:30.596 --> 01:01:32.296
I don't think
we want to do it

01:01:32.298 --> 01:01:33.831
Any more than
a great white shark

01:01:33.833 --> 01:01:35.099
Wants to be
an apex predator.

01:01:35.101 --> 01:01:36.400
It just does
what it does.

01:01:36.402 --> 01:01:38.703
So you think that humans
are just evil?

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.640
Can you keep a secret?

01:01:42.642 --> 01:01:44.041
Yes.

01:01:44.043 --> 01:01:45.376
Okay.

01:01:47.679 --> 01:01:48.779
Hmm?

01:01:48.781 --> 01:01:50.614
No.

01:01:50.616 --> 01:01:52.783
Okay.

01:01:54.152 --> 01:01:55.853
What's the secret?

01:01:58.156 --> 01:02:00.691
I keep whiskey
in the filing cabinet.

01:02:00.693 --> 01:02:02.760
Oh.

01:02:02.762 --> 01:02:04.729
Duh.

01:02:06.164 --> 01:02:08.232
You know, usually students
come to my office,

01:02:08.234 --> 01:02:10.067
And they want to talk
about grades,

01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:11.569
But evil is
far more interesting,

01:02:11.571 --> 01:02:14.405
But I've gotta be honest
with you, Ms. Brooks.

01:02:14.407 --> 01:02:16.774
I'm not sure exactly
where this is going.

01:02:17.943 --> 01:02:20.411
Do you think evil
really exists?

01:02:20.413 --> 01:02:23.247
Yeah. Of course I do.

01:02:23.249 --> 01:02:24.915
Who would deny it?

01:02:24.917 --> 01:02:26.717
Evil is a byproduct
of humanity.

01:02:26.719 --> 01:02:28.886
You--you mean--
I don't understand.

01:02:28.888 --> 01:02:30.187
Like pollution?

01:02:30.189 --> 01:02:32.089
Heh heh. Sure.
Yeah, that's a--

01:02:32.091 --> 01:02:34.358
That's a good way
to put it.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.394
Think about people,
what they do.

01:02:37.396 --> 01:02:41.232
Eh, we're a perfect
planetary suicide machine.

01:02:41.234 --> 01:02:43.134
All we have to do is drive,

01:02:43.136 --> 01:02:46.103
Consume, start a family.

01:02:46.105 --> 01:02:48.739
There's nothing
more effective

01:02:48.741 --> 01:02:49.874
Than human reproduction

01:02:49.876 --> 01:02:52.510
If you want to accelerate
planetary extinction.

01:02:52.512 --> 01:02:55.012
You don't even have to do
anything spectacular

01:02:55.014 --> 01:02:59.283
To play a meaningful role in the grand
human project of ending the world.

01:03:00.352 --> 01:03:02.987
And if you play your part
better than others

01:03:02.989 --> 01:03:05.956
By inventing
some new weapons system

01:03:05.958 --> 01:03:10.060
Or a more efficient way of
extracting resource material,

01:03:10.062 --> 01:03:14.999
Just so you can suck everything
out of the planet before we go--

01:03:15.001 --> 01:03:17.101
I don't know.

01:03:17.103 --> 01:03:20.671
Do you think
that that is evil?

01:03:20.673 --> 01:03:23.707
It's just doing
what we do.

01:03:23.709 --> 01:03:25.576
Isn't it?

01:03:31.249 --> 01:03:34.385
We're rats on a ship,

01:03:34.387 --> 01:03:36.754
Ants on an ice-cream cone.

01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:40.925
We're just going along
for the ride.

01:03:43.061 --> 01:03:45.596
Everything's gonna end.

01:03:45.598 --> 01:03:49.333
I think
the real question is

01:03:49.335 --> 01:03:51.969
Is it gonna end
with a bang

01:03:51.971 --> 01:03:55.139
Or eliot's whimper?

01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:58.809
And, uh, in the meanwhile...

01:04:06.318 --> 01:04:08.285
It just doesn't matter.

01:04:10.188 --> 01:04:12.690
What is it
that the kids say?

01:04:13.992 --> 01:04:18.996
Uh, it's the perfect
expression of nihilism.

01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:23.534
Hmm?

01:04:23.536 --> 01:04:25.903
You know what
I'm talking about.

01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:28.339
No?

01:04:28.341 --> 01:04:31.542
What is it?

01:04:31.544 --> 01:04:33.477
"I did it for the..."

01:04:36.147 --> 01:04:38.315
"I did it for the lulz"?

01:04:38.317 --> 01:04:40.885
Yeah. That's it.

01:04:40.887 --> 01:04:44.355
"I did it for the lulz."

01:04:44.357 --> 01:04:47.291
It's got a nice sound,

01:04:47.293 --> 01:04:48.792
Doesn't it?

01:04:50.195 --> 01:04:52.029
Lulz.

01:04:56.701 --> 01:04:59.737
Is that why
you're here, Ashley?

01:04:59.739 --> 01:05:04.608
Do you want to do
something for the lulz?

01:05:06.645 --> 01:05:08.312
I should go.

01:05:08.314 --> 01:05:10.381
Go. Stay.

01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:14.051
You know
my point of view.

01:05:16.888 --> 01:05:18.355
I just don't care.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.360
Man: Ashley.

01:06:09.342 --> 01:06:11.542
Man: Ashley, I'm here.

01:06:11.544 --> 01:06:12.810
I'm inside your head.

01:06:22.354 --> 01:06:24.855
Over here.

01:06:30.663 --> 01:06:33.564
I'm not scared of you.
Just shut up.

01:06:33.566 --> 01:06:35.532
Shut up. Just shut up.

01:06:35.534 --> 01:06:37.634
Fuck you.
I'm not scared of you.

01:06:37.636 --> 01:06:40.004
Fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:06:40.006 --> 01:06:43.140
Fuck--aah! Shut up!

01:06:43.142 --> 01:06:44.141
Aah!

01:07:05.997 --> 01:07:09.433
What the fuck are you
looking at? Huh?!

01:07:09.435 --> 01:07:11.502
Huh?!

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.572
No.

01:09:33.077 --> 01:09:34.912
Ashley.

01:09:40.118 --> 01:09:41.285
Mom?

01:09:49.428 --> 01:09:53.363
Oh, what's
happening?

01:09:53.365 --> 01:09:55.098
Ow. I think
you broke my nose.

01:09:56.434 --> 01:09:57.935
Am I dreaming?

01:09:57.937 --> 01:10:00.704
Uh, does it look
like you're dreaming?

01:10:03.308 --> 01:10:04.908
No.

01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:06.810
This seems
pretty real.

01:10:06.812 --> 01:10:08.011
That's 'cause it is.

01:10:08.013 --> 01:10:10.380
My nose is broken
in a pretty real way.

01:10:10.382 --> 01:10:11.982
Gotta go get a towel.

01:10:21.226 --> 01:10:23.727
Sorry about your nose

01:10:23.729 --> 01:10:26.463
And being just insane.

01:10:26.465 --> 01:10:27.931
That's okay.

01:10:27.933 --> 01:10:30.234
And I'm sorry
that I yelled.

01:10:30.236 --> 01:10:31.768
You're not insane.

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:34.504
I know
you're just scared.

01:10:34.506 --> 01:10:38.842
Oh. Zane and I,
we had sex,

01:10:38.844 --> 01:10:42.746
And then he split right
before you started screaming.

01:10:44.048 --> 01:10:46.383
I seriously
can't take this anymore.

01:10:48.019 --> 01:10:52.522
I mean, is this real,
or am I just going crazy?

01:10:52.524 --> 01:10:54.658
I think both, dude.

01:10:59.864 --> 01:11:02.032
Who are you calling?

01:11:02.034 --> 01:11:04.301
It's 4:00
in the morning.

01:11:04.303 --> 01:11:05.302
They're open.

01:11:09.407 --> 01:11:10.641
Operator:
911 emergency.

01:11:10.643 --> 01:11:14.111
Hi. I'd like
to report a murder.

01:11:20.885 --> 01:11:23.086
Could I have
some more coffee?

01:11:24.622 --> 01:11:26.623
Sure.

01:11:26.625 --> 01:11:28.125
You want me
to make this run?

01:11:28.127 --> 01:11:30.327
Ah, I got it.
I need another cup, too.

01:11:33.197 --> 01:11:35.666
All right, let's
go over this again.

01:11:35.668 --> 01:11:36.900
Okay.

01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:40.904
Now, you called in
to report a murder,

01:11:40.906 --> 01:11:43.206
Maybe two, you don't know.

01:11:43.208 --> 01:11:44.474
I do know.

01:11:44.476 --> 01:11:45.876
Definitely
several murders.

01:11:45.878 --> 01:11:47.778
I witnessed
at least two.

01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:49.613
On video.

01:11:49.615 --> 01:11:51.615
And you say that
both of these murder--

01:11:51.617 --> 01:11:54.184
Well, all these murders
were performed

01:11:54.186 --> 01:11:56.486
By the same guy,
the same person,

01:11:56.488 --> 01:11:59.022
This, uh, smiley.

01:11:59.857 --> 01:12:01.024
Okay. Well, just so--

01:12:01.026 --> 01:12:03.727
Just so we
get this straight...

01:12:05.697 --> 01:12:07.664
Smiley appears
behind people

01:12:07.666 --> 01:12:09.933
In an anonymous
video chat,

01:12:09.935 --> 01:12:13.103
Like from out of
cyberspace or something,

01:12:13.105 --> 01:12:15.806
When the other person
types in, uh,

01:12:15.808 --> 01:12:19.810
"I did it for the lulz. I did it for the lulz.
I did it for the lulz."

01:12:19.812 --> 01:12:23.246
Yes. I told you,
I know it sounds crazy.

01:12:24.649 --> 01:12:28.585
But, I mean,
it happened.

01:12:28.587 --> 01:12:30.520
Hmm. Yeah.

01:12:30.522 --> 01:12:33.623
And he--he chased me
across campus,

01:12:33.625 --> 01:12:35.892
And then he
tried to kill me.

01:12:35.894 --> 01:12:37.728
And then you woke up.

01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:39.763
But I must have
blacked out.

01:12:39.765 --> 01:12:41.798
Maybe he did
something to me.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.301
I'm gonna
tell you the part

01:12:44.303 --> 01:12:45.802
I'm having
a hard time with.

01:12:45.804 --> 01:12:47.871
All of it.

01:12:49.107 --> 01:12:50.006
But...

01:12:50.008 --> 01:12:52.242
Look, look, look.
Listen. Listen.

01:12:52.244 --> 01:12:54.711
Just hear me out.
This is what it looks like

01:12:54.713 --> 01:12:56.880
From my perspective
as a police detective.

01:12:58.116 --> 01:13:02.686
First of all,
you have no victim.

01:13:02.688 --> 01:13:03.987
But we do
have victims.

01:13:03.989 --> 01:13:05.722
But there are no bodies.

01:13:05.724 --> 01:13:07.791
You say you saw
dead people,

01:13:07.793 --> 01:13:09.993
But you don't know
who they are,

01:13:09.995 --> 01:13:13.430
Except for some nicknames
that, uh, nobody can trace.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:19.002
It is very difficult
to investigate a crime

01:13:19.004 --> 01:13:22.973
When it's not very clear
that any crime has been done.

01:13:22.975 --> 01:13:26.543
You haven't found
a single body?

01:13:26.545 --> 01:13:28.578
We find bodies
all the time.

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:31.248
We just haven't found one that fit
the description that you gave.

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:33.617
And nobody's
called in about smiley?

01:13:33.619 --> 01:13:36.553
No, we've had a few calls
about this smiley character,

01:13:36.555 --> 01:13:39.222
But yours is the first one
that we've taken

01:13:39.224 --> 01:13:41.258
Seriously enough
to have this talk.

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:45.028
Now, you look like
a nice girl

01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:47.297
That nobody
would want to hurt,

01:13:47.299 --> 01:13:50.367
So I gotta ask you.

01:13:52.236 --> 01:13:55.539
Are you on the wrong end
of some kind of prank?

01:13:55.541 --> 01:13:56.540
You been punk'd?

01:13:56.542 --> 01:13:58.008
No!

01:13:58.010 --> 01:13:59.709
Why won't you
believe me?

01:13:59.711 --> 01:14:05.015
Look, I'll show you
everything I'm talking about.

01:14:05.017 --> 01:14:06.283
You're welcome.

01:14:07.218 --> 01:14:09.519
Let me show you
something first.

01:14:09.521 --> 01:14:10.921
Coop.

01:14:19.864 --> 01:14:21.031
How did you get that?

01:14:21.033 --> 01:14:22.732
How did we get it?

01:14:22.734 --> 01:14:24.367
I think pretty much
everybody got it.

01:14:24.369 --> 01:14:26.436
Over 5 million views
since yesterday.

01:14:26.438 --> 01:14:29.873
Maybe he took it.
Maybe he took it.

01:14:29.875 --> 01:14:33.543
We have to take allegations like
the one you called in seriously,

01:14:33.545 --> 01:14:37.280
So we're not gonna press charges
against you for wasting our time.

01:14:38.649 --> 01:14:40.050
If you believe
everything

01:14:40.052 --> 01:14:43.053
That you
told us tonight,

01:14:43.055 --> 01:14:47.324
Please, please,

01:14:47.326 --> 01:14:49.159
You need to see
a psychiatrist.

01:14:49.161 --> 01:14:52.529
I am seeing
a psychiatrist.

01:14:53.831 --> 01:14:56.733
I am.

01:14:56.735 --> 01:14:58.969
Well, that's too bad.

01:14:58.971 --> 01:15:01.605
Uhh! This is bullshit!

01:15:01.607 --> 01:15:03.940
Well, at least my nose isn't broken.
I guess that's good news.

01:15:03.942 --> 01:15:06.042
Proxy, they didn't
believe any of it.

01:15:06.044 --> 01:15:07.544
How can everything
just be gone?

01:15:07.546 --> 01:15:08.545
I don't know.

01:15:08.547 --> 01:15:09.813
Okay, we did
the same thing

01:15:09.815 --> 01:15:12.349
In my interview room, and
I just-- I don't know.

01:15:12.351 --> 01:15:15.952
It's just weird. He--it--okay,
whatever smiley is,

01:15:15.954 --> 01:15:18.889
He's just
playing with us.

01:15:18.891 --> 01:15:22.926
But how can you erase everything
over the whole Internet?

01:15:22.928 --> 01:15:24.628
You can't.

01:15:26.497 --> 01:15:29.332
Not if you're human.

01:15:37.208 --> 01:15:39.543
I promise
I'm feeling better.

01:15:39.545 --> 01:15:44.648
And it's not like I'm saying
yesterday I was crazy

01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:46.283
And today I'm not.

01:15:46.285 --> 01:15:49.052
I still believe
everything I said,

01:15:49.054 --> 01:15:52.556
But it was just really weird
at the police station.

01:15:52.558 --> 01:15:54.090
And?

01:15:55.293 --> 01:15:57.994
Look, I'm not there yet,

01:15:57.996 --> 01:16:00.964
But maybe I've
been having trouble

01:16:00.966 --> 01:16:02.966
With what's real
and what's not.

01:16:02.968 --> 01:16:05.035
Good.

01:16:05.037 --> 01:16:06.970
Is it bad?

01:16:06.972 --> 01:16:09.706
Acknowledging it
is good.

01:16:09.708 --> 01:16:11.408
That's a scary thing to do,

01:16:11.410 --> 01:16:14.444
Admit that your perceptions are in
conflict with objective reality,

01:16:14.446 --> 01:16:18.582
And it's the first step to bringing
them in line with each other.

01:16:18.584 --> 01:16:21.117
Are you sure?

01:16:21.119 --> 01:16:24.754
Trust me. This is good.

01:16:40.004 --> 01:16:42.205
Ashley: Thanks so much
for doing this.

01:16:42.207 --> 01:16:44.975
Hey, being a total nerd is
good for something, right?

01:16:44.977 --> 01:16:46.743
You're not a nerd.

01:16:46.745 --> 01:16:50.080
And it's so awesome that you
gave me your old computer.

01:16:50.082 --> 01:16:51.915
Ah, well,
that's what friends do.

01:16:51.917 --> 01:16:53.750
You didn't
have to do that.

01:16:53.752 --> 01:16:56.720
I know,
but I wanted to.

01:16:58.389 --> 01:17:02.492
So not to be
any nerdier than usual,

01:17:02.494 --> 01:17:05.061
But this computer is
fully equipped, okay?

01:17:05.063 --> 01:17:07.597
It has your own firewall,
128-bit encryption

01:17:07.599 --> 01:17:08.865
And a 256-bit key.

01:17:10.502 --> 01:17:12.969
I don't know
what you just said,

01:17:12.971 --> 01:17:15.338
But sounds good.

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:17.607
Okay,
this is the dungeon.

01:17:17.609 --> 01:17:20.276
I am the dungeon master.

01:17:20.278 --> 01:17:23.513
This is the dungeon
master's key.

01:17:23.515 --> 01:17:26.282
Why, thank you,
dungeon master.

01:17:26.284 --> 01:17:28.785
You're welcome,
princess.

01:17:28.787 --> 01:17:31.488
Unfortunately
the dungeon master

01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:33.156
Never gets
the princess.

01:17:36.827 --> 01:17:38.561
Sometimes they do.

01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:01.384
Whoa!

01:18:01.386 --> 01:18:02.852
Ohh!

01:18:02.854 --> 01:18:04.454
Heh. You crazy kids.

01:18:04.456 --> 01:18:06.423
Hi.

01:18:06.425 --> 01:18:08.058
So you're sure
you're cool with me

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:09.392
Going to my parents'
for the weekend?

01:18:09.394 --> 01:18:11.027
I just--I really
gotta clear my head.

01:18:11.029 --> 01:18:12.762
Yeah, totally.

01:18:16.033 --> 01:18:19.636
Oh. Okay, well, uh,
I should probably go,

01:18:19.638 --> 01:18:22.172
So see you later?

01:18:23.874 --> 01:18:25.575
Bye, dungeon master.

01:18:29.847 --> 01:18:31.981
Dungeon master?

01:18:31.983 --> 01:18:33.083
That's kinky.

01:18:33.085 --> 01:18:34.984
Not like that.

01:18:34.986 --> 01:18:37.587
The nerd kind
of dungeon master.

01:18:37.589 --> 01:18:38.588
Yeah.

01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:39.456
He's sweet.

01:18:39.458 --> 01:18:41.224
Whatever.
No judging here.

01:18:41.226 --> 01:18:43.927
There are handcuffs in my
underwear drawer if you need 'em.

01:18:43.929 --> 01:18:45.228
If you need me,
call me.

01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:46.396
Otherwise, I don't know.
We could just,

01:18:46.398 --> 01:18:48.631
Like, video chat
the whole time.

01:18:48.633 --> 01:18:50.200
Okay.

01:18:51.802 --> 01:18:53.169
You'll be fine.

01:18:53.171 --> 01:18:55.271
I know.
I'll talk to you?

01:18:55.273 --> 01:18:56.339
Text me.
Okay.

01:18:56.341 --> 01:18:58.074
Okay.
Have a good weekend.

01:18:58.076 --> 01:18:59.075
Yeah, have fun.

01:18:59.077 --> 01:19:01.911
So much fun. Bye.

01:19:08.586 --> 01:19:11.988
Heh. Yes, really,
daddy, I'm fine.

01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:13.823
Okay, sweetheart.

01:19:13.825 --> 01:19:16.593
You know you can always call
me if you need me, right?

01:19:16.595 --> 01:19:18.828
Yes, I know.

01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:20.196
I love you.

01:19:20.198 --> 01:19:23.433
I love you back. Heh.

01:19:32.076 --> 01:19:33.409
Oh, my God.
Thank God you're there.

01:19:33.411 --> 01:19:35.378
Hey, what's up?
Are you okay?

01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:36.813
I can't find Zane.

01:19:36.815 --> 01:19:38.148
Zane?
Yeah.

01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:41.584
Um, we were gonna
do stuff on video chat.

01:19:41.586 --> 01:19:43.920
It's the only thing
he's never late for.

01:19:46.091 --> 01:19:48.691
What? What, you think he's
hooking up with some other slut?

01:19:48.693 --> 01:19:51.261
Mm, or...

01:19:51.263 --> 01:19:53.496
Oh, my God.

01:19:53.498 --> 01:19:54.464
Smiley?

01:19:54.466 --> 01:19:55.965
I'm gonna call the cops.

01:19:55.967 --> 01:19:57.700
No. I'll go.

01:19:57.702 --> 01:19:59.269
No, you can't go
by yourself.

01:19:59.271 --> 01:20:01.137
Binder will
come with me.

01:20:01.139 --> 01:20:02.505
Uh, okay, fine, fine.

01:20:02.507 --> 01:20:04.874
Okay, fine. Yeah,
I guess if he goes with you.

01:20:04.876 --> 01:20:07.143
Okay, stay online. I'll make
sure everything's okay.

01:20:07.145 --> 01:20:08.578
Be careful!

01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:09.946
Yeah. Bye.

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:13.716
Hey, you've reached
binder's voice mail.

01:20:13.718 --> 01:20:14.851
Leave me a message.

01:20:14.853 --> 01:20:17.187
Hey, binder. It's Ashley.

01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:19.355
Could you give me
a call when you get this?

01:20:19.357 --> 01:20:21.724
Proxy just called me,
and Zane's not, um--

01:20:21.726 --> 01:20:24.227
Just call me when you
get this, okay?

01:20:39.643 --> 01:20:41.611
Zane!

01:20:48.485 --> 01:20:50.320
Hello?

01:20:50.322 --> 01:20:52.188
Are you here?

01:20:58.662 --> 01:21:00.330
Hello?

01:21:04.735 --> 01:21:07.003
Zane?

01:22:19.643 --> 01:22:21.010
Ashley.

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.348
Ashley.

01:22:26.417 --> 01:22:28.284
Ashley. Ashley.

01:22:28.286 --> 01:22:30.119
Ashley. Ashley.
No!

01:22:30.121 --> 01:22:32.956
Ashley. Ashley.

01:22:45.936 --> 01:22:46.936
This is diamond.

01:22:46.938 --> 01:22:48.304
You have to help me.

01:22:48.306 --> 01:22:49.372
Zane's dead.

01:22:49.374 --> 01:22:51.908
I'm sorry. Who is this?

01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:52.842
Ashley. Ashley Brooks.

01:22:52.844 --> 01:22:55.244
I called you about
the serial killer.

01:22:55.246 --> 01:22:57.513
Ah, Ms. Brooks. Heh heh.

01:22:57.515 --> 01:23:01.818
Is this another one of your
friends from cyberspace?

01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:03.553
Yes.

01:23:03.555 --> 01:23:06.189
He's dead. I saw the
body in person.

01:23:06.191 --> 01:23:07.290
Ms. Brooks.

01:23:07.292 --> 01:23:08.391
Hello?

01:23:09.594 --> 01:23:11.694
She dropped the call.

01:23:11.696 --> 01:23:14.397
I'm sure
she'll call back.

01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:18.101
Wha--did you just
hang up on me?

01:23:18.103 --> 01:23:20.503
Fucking crackpots.

01:23:20.505 --> 01:23:22.972
What the fuck?

01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:31.514
Proxy: Ashley?
Proxy!

01:23:31.516 --> 01:23:32.882
Ashley. Ashley,
what's going on?

01:23:32.884 --> 01:23:34.484
Zane's dead.
Oh, my God.

01:23:34.486 --> 01:23:36.452
Smiley cut off his face.
Oh, my God, Ashley.

01:23:36.454 --> 01:23:37.553
There's blood
everywhere.

01:23:37.555 --> 01:23:39.989
Call the police.
Call 911. 911.

01:23:41.158 --> 01:23:42.291
No.

01:23:42.293 --> 01:23:44.027
No?

01:23:45.462 --> 01:23:48.064
This has to stop now.

01:23:48.066 --> 01:23:50.333
Oh, my God. No, no, no.

01:23:50.335 --> 01:23:51.334
Ashley, no.

01:23:51.336 --> 01:23:52.335
Do it.

01:23:52.337 --> 01:23:53.803
No. You can't.

01:24:03.814 --> 01:24:06.649
Come on. Do it
before I change my mind.

01:24:08.952 --> 01:24:10.987
Fuck.

01:24:10.989 --> 01:24:12.522
Are you sure?

01:24:13.524 --> 01:24:16.426
You have to mean it,
proxy.

01:24:16.428 --> 01:24:18.861
You have to picture him
killing me.

01:25:26.029 --> 01:25:27.763
Oh, my God. Binder.

01:25:27.765 --> 01:25:30.967
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

01:25:30.969 --> 01:25:33.803
I'm so sorry. I really didn't
mean to do this to you.

01:25:33.805 --> 01:25:36.172
It was an accident.
I promise.

01:25:36.174 --> 01:25:37.807
It was an accident.

01:25:37.809 --> 01:25:39.675
You're gonna be fine.

01:25:39.677 --> 01:25:41.544
You're gonna be fine,
okay. Just breathe.

01:26:25.389 --> 01:26:27.356
What the...

01:26:48.879 --> 01:26:52.882
Clayton: What brings people
to do the things they do?

01:26:52.884 --> 01:26:57.153
Reason and ethics can
explain some of man's motives,

01:26:57.155 --> 01:26:59.722
But only some.

01:27:01.024 --> 01:27:04.727
We all have the capacity
to commit the most...

01:27:04.729 --> 01:27:08.831
Vicious of acts,
the cruelest of atrocities,

01:27:08.833 --> 01:27:13.135
To do something
simply because we can.

01:27:13.137 --> 01:27:18.140
But what prevents us
from doing the unthinkable?

01:27:18.142 --> 01:27:21.744
From crossing over from
the light and into the dark?

01:27:22.713 --> 01:27:26.716
Every community
lives by a moral code,

01:27:26.718 --> 01:27:28.918
And when that code
is broken,

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:34.190
We're led to believe that a force has
been unleashed onto the universe...

01:27:35.993 --> 01:27:38.194
A score needed to be settled...

01:27:39.763 --> 01:27:41.497
A bounty to be collected.

01:27:41.499 --> 01:27:46.135
Of course,
we can never know for sure

01:27:46.137 --> 01:27:49.438
The consequences
of our actions.

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:52.975
But one thing we know for sure

01:27:52.977 --> 01:27:56.746
Is that our actions
will have consequences.

01:27:58.148 --> 01:28:02.218
And in the struggle
between good and evil...

01:28:03.987 --> 01:28:06.922
We'll never know
who has the last laugh.

01:28:11.662 --> 01:28:14.230
Oh, my God.
Holy shit.

01:28:14.232 --> 01:28:15.564
Ohh.

01:28:15.566 --> 01:28:19.001
Boys, we fucking
did it.

01:28:19.003 --> 01:28:21.103
Dude, that bitch
went fucking splat.

01:28:21.105 --> 01:28:23.172
Yeah, I gotta
instagram that.

01:28:24.741 --> 01:28:26.776
Woman:
Guys, what happened?

01:28:26.778 --> 01:28:28.711
We didn't even
get to come out.

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.281
Our noob fell

01:28:32.283 --> 01:28:34.183
And broke her neck.

01:28:34.185 --> 01:28:35.251
She's dead.

01:28:37.221 --> 01:28:40.189
Oh, my God.

01:28:41.426 --> 01:28:44.026
That's awesome.

01:28:44.028 --> 01:28:45.461
Oh, shit.

01:28:45.463 --> 01:28:47.563
We have to get
out of here.

01:28:47.565 --> 01:28:48.764
Oh, relax.
We're fine.

01:28:48.766 --> 01:28:51.133
Proxy: Oh, my God! Ashley!

01:28:51.135 --> 01:28:52.501
Ashley!
What's going on?!

01:28:52.503 --> 01:28:55.771
Oh, my God.
Shut up, you whore.

01:28:55.773 --> 01:28:56.906
It's over.

01:28:56.908 --> 01:28:58.207
What do you mean
it's over?

01:28:58.209 --> 01:29:00.910
She fell on her head,
and now she's dead.

01:29:00.912 --> 01:29:02.545
Oh. That rhymed.

01:29:02.547 --> 01:29:04.280
Oh, my God.

01:29:06.783 --> 01:29:09.552
That's fantastic!

01:29:09.554 --> 01:29:11.087
Hey, uh, Daniel day-Lewis,

01:29:11.089 --> 01:29:13.522
Your girlfriend just landed a
triple lindy on her brain.

01:29:13.524 --> 01:29:15.391
What up?

01:29:15.393 --> 01:29:17.126
Ah, and I didn't even
get to fuck her?

01:29:17.128 --> 01:29:19.362
Ah, well, she's not
going anywhere.

01:29:19.364 --> 01:29:21.530
You're right. Hmm.

01:29:21.532 --> 01:29:24.834
Oh, and, uh, by the way, good
call on the double kill.

01:29:24.836 --> 01:29:27.236
I really thought I cut
you up there for a sec.

01:29:27.238 --> 01:29:29.071
Ah, well, you know,
a little latex

01:29:29.073 --> 01:29:31.273
And corn syrup
goes a long way.

01:29:32.543 --> 01:29:34.577
Wait. Did Ashley
do it on purpose,

01:29:34.579 --> 01:29:35.845
Or it was
an accident?

01:29:35.847 --> 01:29:37.279
It was
an accident,

01:29:37.281 --> 01:29:38.981
But we're still calling
it a win for anonymous.

01:29:38.983 --> 01:29:40.182
Whoo!
Uh, not sure

01:29:40.184 --> 01:29:42.918
Our hacktivist branch
will condone this.

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:44.387
Okay, you know what?

01:29:44.389 --> 01:29:45.855
Fuck those guys.

01:29:45.857 --> 01:29:48.624
They don't get to say who's
anonymous and who's not.

01:29:48.626 --> 01:29:49.959
The troll army?

01:29:49.961 --> 01:29:51.894
They don't have any
command or control.

01:29:51.896 --> 01:29:53.929
I mean, they say
we're off message?

01:29:53.931 --> 01:29:55.531
No, fuck them.
They're off message.

01:29:55.533 --> 01:29:59.001
Because, I mean, there's
only one reason to troll.

01:30:00.537 --> 01:30:01.804
For the lulz.

01:30:01.806 --> 01:30:03.906
For the lulz!
For the lulz!

01:30:03.908 --> 01:30:05.107
Amen, brother.

01:30:05.109 --> 01:30:07.143
Well, now that
she's dead,

01:30:07.145 --> 01:30:09.044
I guess smiley's
dead, too, right?

01:30:09.046 --> 01:30:10.479
Heh. God,
you know what, kells?

01:30:10.481 --> 01:30:12.548
I'm really glad we
killed you off early,

01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:14.817
'cause I feel like you
just don't get it.

01:30:14.819 --> 01:30:16.085
You see,
smiley's not dead.

01:30:16.087 --> 01:30:17.520
Smiley is immortal.

01:30:17.522 --> 01:30:20.222
Smiley'll be around
longer than any of us.

01:30:20.224 --> 01:30:22.458
You know, he's like
the pyramids

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:25.461
Or the great work
of William Shakespeare.

01:30:25.463 --> 01:30:27.229
<i>He's chocolate rain.</i>

01:30:28.766 --> 01:30:30.099
And these masks,

01:30:30.101 --> 01:30:32.768
They're in boxes
all over campus

01:30:32.770 --> 01:30:35.571
And about
20 other campuses.

01:30:35.573 --> 01:30:40.476
It's only a matter of time before
the copycats start rolling in.

01:30:40.478 --> 01:30:42.411
Smiley can be anyone

01:30:42.413 --> 01:30:45.347
Anywhere
at any time.

01:30:46.184 --> 01:30:49.151
The first viral
serial killer.

01:30:49.153 --> 01:30:50.686
Oh, God,
something tells me

01:30:50.688 --> 01:30:53.122
Smiley's gonna be really
popular this Halloween.

01:30:53.124 --> 01:30:54.657
Ah, it's gonna
be historic.

01:30:54.659 --> 01:30:57.259
People are gonna be speaking
our names for generations.

01:30:57.261 --> 01:31:01.297
Except they don't actually
know our names, right?

01:31:01.299 --> 01:31:02.331
You know what?

01:31:02.333 --> 01:31:03.699
That part's actually
really important.

01:31:03.701 --> 01:31:05.100
We should probably
get our shit

01:31:05.102 --> 01:31:07.069
And get the fuck
out of here.

01:31:14.478 --> 01:31:16.679
I kind of have a boner.

01:31:16.681 --> 01:31:17.813
Is that weird?

01:31:17.815 --> 01:31:20.916
Look, Zane, um,
is she really dead?

01:31:20.918 --> 01:31:22.918
Uh, yeah.

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:27.656
She's really,
really, really dead.

01:31:27.658 --> 01:31:29.992
Are we bad people?

01:31:30.794 --> 01:31:32.228
Yeah.

01:31:33.663 --> 01:31:36.031
Why did we do this?
Seriously?

01:31:36.033 --> 01:31:38.968
Oh, well, I don't know
why you did it,

01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:41.537
But I know why I did it.

01:31:47.077 --> 01:31:49.545
That's not funny,
Zane.

01:31:50.548 --> 01:31:52.014
We really
killed her.

01:31:52.016 --> 01:31:54.517
Oh, come on.
She killed herself.

01:31:54.519 --> 01:31:56.151
Yeah.

01:31:56.153 --> 01:31:57.720
Proxy!

01:32:08.265 --> 01:32:09.999
Holy shit.
