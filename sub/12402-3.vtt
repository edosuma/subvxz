00:11.971 --> 00:14.265
Shane's old boyfriend, right?

00:14.349 --> 00:16.559
Wow! Good to see you.

00:16.643 --> 00:17.852
What a coincidence.

00:17.936 --> 00:20.355
-That'll be $26.50.
-Okay.

00:20.438 --> 00:22.774
Oh, right.
Well, I'm sure I'll see you around.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.859
-I'll see you around.
-Okay.

Wanna... get in?

00:33.660 --> 00:35.203
Uh, should I just get in the front, or...

00:35.286 --> 00:37.038
-Hop in the back.
-Okay, cool.

00:37.121 --> 00:38.122
[dogs barking]

00:38.206 --> 00:40.625

What are you doing here? This is insane!

00:52.804 --> 00:55.014
What? A black man can't be in the pool?

00:55.098 --> 00:57.100
Wanna call the mayor, have him drain it?

00:57.183 --> 00:58.851
No. It's just that...

00:58.935 --> 01:00.562
[Maria stammering]

01:00.645 --> 01:03.314
We've been running into each other...
Now you're here.

01:03.398 --> 01:05.108
-You know--
-I'm just kidding.

01:05.191 --> 01:07.569
Oh. [laughing]
Oh, my God.

01:07.652 --> 01:08.653
Oh, I was...

01:08.736 --> 01:12.073
I love humor.
Uh, yeah.

01:12.156 --> 01:13.783
Oh, my gosh...

01:13.866 --> 01:15.868
-I was scared there, for a second.
-Why?

01:15.952 --> 01:17.245
'Cause I'm black?

01:17.996 --> 01:18.955
No.

01:19.038 --> 01:21.583
-I was kidding again.
-Oh, my God.

01:21.666 --> 01:22.792
You need to lighten up.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.836
-That was good.
-Like I wish I could...

01:24.919 --> 01:27.630
-but I'm black.
-Oh... [softly] I don't know.

01:30.216 --> 01:31.759
Am I supposed to laugh at that?

01:31.843 --> 01:33.636
Depends if you're racist or not.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.430
Do you think I'm racist?

01:36.556 --> 01:37.682
Is asking that racist?

01:37.765 --> 01:40.601
There's no right answer.
Things aren't black and white.

01:41.686 --> 01:43.354
Or are they?

01:43.438 --> 01:48.318
Oh... Oh, no.

02:07.378 --> 02:09.255
I've secured my lady a part,

which meets all her
prescribed requirements...

02:11.966 --> 02:14.052
sans audition.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.512
Requirements?

02:16.596 --> 02:20.099
It's a sitcom. Easy hours.
You'll be home every day by 4:00.

02:21.017 --> 02:23.478
Stupid money.
Plus, you said you wanted

02:23.561 --> 02:24.812
more diversity in your life?

02:24.937 --> 02:25.938
Well, get this...

02:26.022 --> 02:27.273
it's a black show.

02:27.357 --> 02:29.233
The leads are these two black comics

you can't tell one from the other.

-Bruce.
-No! They're twins.

02:34.364 --> 02:36.532
Oh, no, I...

02:36.616 --> 02:39.285
I will like to have more diversity
in my life.

02:39.369 --> 02:43.456
I'm just worried about everything I do
or say lately, racially.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.375
Oh, are you a racist?

02:45.458 --> 02:49.504
-No! Do I seem like a racist?
-No, of course not.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.881
-Do I?
-No!

02:51.964 --> 02:54.759
Let's see what
Ask Jeeves has to say about it.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.052
Uh, Chantrelle?

02:56.135 --> 02:57.053
[Chantrelle] Yeah?

02:57.136 --> 03:00.598
Ask Jeeves for groups in LA
for people who hate being racist.

03:00.681 --> 03:04.352
-I don't hate being racist. That's--
-You should.

03:04.435 --> 03:05.728
[Chantrelle] How about this?

03:05.812 --> 03:08.481
"Are you nervous
you're a full blown racist?"

03:08.564 --> 03:10.024
Yes.

03:10.108 --> 03:13.528
"Are your ethnic friends annoyed
you ask too many questions about race?"

03:13.611 --> 03:15.321
Yes!

03:15.405 --> 03:17.031
"Bring questions about black people

03:17.115 --> 03:22.453
and other minorities to LA P.U.R.E.,
People United for Racial Equality."

03:22.537 --> 03:27.834
That's exactly what I need.
A group to talk about racial issues.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.544
I knew Chantrelle could handle <i> </i>

03:29.627 --> 03:32.713

She does possess the name of a black lady.

03:32.797 --> 03:34.340
-Chantrelle!
-[Chantrelle] What?

03:34.424 --> 03:35.967
Nothing, my sweet.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.677
Bruce, this is great. Thank you.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.763
And... I'll do the pilot.
I need the money.

03:40.847 --> 03:44.642
And America needs to see your face
on its tiny tube screens.

-And we're back!

03:47.311 --> 03:48.730
[Bruce laughing]

03:49.439 --> 03:54.402
So amazing to have such a diverse turnout
for our LA P.U.R.E. meeting.

03:58.865 --> 04:01.117
I'm sorry. I have a question.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.454
Oh, names first.
We always start with names first.

04:04.537 --> 04:06.289
Okay, my name is Maria.

04:09.876 --> 04:11.210
And... I'm white.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.712
[all] Hi, Maria.

04:12.795 --> 04:17.300
Okay. I don't have
many friends who are black,

04:17.382 --> 04:22.764
and I just wanna be more cognizant
of racism and white privilege.

04:22.847 --> 04:27.769
And I have this job next week,
and it's a TV pilot with a diverse cast,

04:27.852 --> 04:30.062
and I'm just really anxious.

04:30.146 --> 04:33.274
I don't want to say or do anything wrong.

04:33.357 --> 04:34.984
What's the show about?

04:35.067 --> 04:38.654
It's about two African American brothers
who are garbage people.

04:38.738 --> 04:41.032
[all exclaiming]

04:41.115 --> 04:45.453
Maria, we don't call them
garbage people anymore.

04:45.536 --> 04:48.581
No, no. That's... their job.

04:48.664 --> 04:51.584
Wait... you called them garbage people?

04:51.667 --> 04:55.213
Of course, I did. We all did.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.631
Just by being white.

04:56.714 --> 04:58.758
-Get it?
-Uh...

04:58.841 --> 05:00.051
-No.
-No.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.970
That's the right attitude.
You don't get it.

05:03.054 --> 05:05.014
That's the point of our group.

05:05.097 --> 05:08.434
We believe that interfering,
or even trying to relate,

05:08.518 --> 05:11.437
is an implicit insult
to people whose struggles

05:11.521 --> 05:13.397
we couldn't possibly understand.

05:13.481 --> 05:16.025
Right. Okay.

05:16.108 --> 05:21.572
Look, I really use to wanna relate.
I practically wanted to be a black person.

05:22.782 --> 05:25.618
But we can't burden them anymore
with our issues.

05:25.701 --> 05:27.370
-Keep it light.
-[Maria] Okay.

05:27.453 --> 05:31.082
You know, weather, sports...

05:31.165 --> 05:33.167
"Is that a new car?"
That type of stuff.

05:33.251 --> 05:36.629
-Okay.
-Remember, if you're white, keep it light.

05:36.712 --> 05:37.922
Okay.

05:38.005 --> 05:41.384
[Sheri] They've already been burdened
with our shenanigans.

05:41.467 --> 05:44.136
Especially our nation's
ultimate shenanigan...

05:44.220 --> 05:45.221
slavery.

05:47.056 --> 05:48.641
[Maria] Yeah.

05:48.724 --> 05:51.102
[Maria] <i>That seemed like solid advice.</i>

05:51.185 --> 05:53.437
<i>Groups have helped me a lot in the past.</i>

05:53.521 --> 05:55.189
[Maria] I have great news.

05:55.273 --> 05:58.067
My agent, Karen Grisham, got me a job!

05:58.150 --> 06:00.152
A commercial for a huge superstore.

06:00.236 --> 06:01.571
It's not about the money.

06:01.654 --> 06:03.072
It's what it represents.

06:03.155 --> 06:06.200
Which is a huge amount of money.

06:06.284 --> 06:09.287
I should be able to pay off
my debt in four months.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.414
Yay!

06:11.497 --> 06:12.582
[sighing]

06:16.210 --> 06:18.713
But it probably won't work out.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.631
I mean... nothing ever does.

06:20.715 --> 06:23.384
They'll look at me,
and be like, "You're fired."

06:23.467 --> 06:28.180
You know, super-agent Karen Grisham,
she'll let me go as a client. [chuckling]

06:28.264 --> 06:29.640
I don't even have a character

06:29.765 --> 06:31.100
for the commercial yet.

06:31.183 --> 06:34.645
And I probably won't be able
to think of one in time.

06:34.729 --> 06:37.857
You know what?
It'll never last. [chuckles]

06:37.940 --> 06:40.067
Time! All right.

06:40.151 --> 06:43.654
I don't wanna cross talk here,
but that's great, Maria.

06:43.738 --> 06:46.282
-[shrieks quietly]
-Okay, who wants to share next?

06:48.159 --> 06:52.496
I know this is wrong,
but when I'm in a store,

06:52.580 --> 06:56.292
there are things that
I see that I have to buy.

06:56.375 --> 06:59.587
It's like there's electricity
going through my body,

06:59.670 --> 07:03.299
and every molecule is vibrating.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.843
It feels so good!

07:09.138 --> 07:12.224
Oh, I love just running
up and down the aisles,

07:12.308 --> 07:14.352
looking at all the new stuff.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.312
And at the ends of the aisles...

the hot goods! [laughs]

As your manager,
I will manage Karen's disappointment.

Great angle. That's exactly the way
we're gonna play it.

08:26.257 --> 08:29.635
So, here's the plan.
I'm gonna say, "Hello. How are you?"

08:29.719 --> 08:30.803
Handshake. Handshake.

08:30.886 --> 08:32.679
"Did you see the recent sports game?"

08:32.763 --> 08:34.974
A mention of an article
in <i>The New Yorker</i>

08:35.057 --> 08:36.433
on artisanal meats.
That's it.

-Yes.

First of all, let me say
an old-fashioned apology.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.612
And let's not say goodbye.

08:48.696 --> 08:52.158
Let's say, as the French do,
please don't drop us as a client.

08:52.241 --> 08:53.617
What's this fuck-brain saying?

08:53.701 --> 08:56.162

that it didn't go well.

made for pennies by forced child labor.

10:21.831 --> 10:23.374
[all laughing]

10:23.457 --> 10:27.336
Put your hands together for the sellout,
Maria Bamford.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.213
[audience applauding]

10:33.008 --> 10:34.176
Oh, my gosh.

10:34.260 --> 10:36.137
-Uh... yeah.
-[feedback]

10:36.220 --> 10:39.598
I have done a series
of commercials, and, uh...

10:39.682 --> 10:41.058
[blowing]

10:41.142 --> 10:43.727
[laughter]

10:44.478 --> 10:47.606
I am a radical, militant...

10:47.690 --> 10:50.526
Green Party socialist
and a hypocrite, it turns out.

10:52.111 --> 10:54.780
Oh, boy...

10:54.864 --> 10:56.490
I will be taking that money

10:56.574 --> 10:59.285
and redecorating my house
in shades of gray.

10:59.368 --> 11:03.539
-[all laughing]
-I don't feel good about myself.

11:03.622 --> 11:08.460
[Maria] <i>Yes, I was a sellout,</i>
<i>and I would never let that happen again.</i>

11:11.005 --> 11:13.507
[audience cheering]

11:17.136 --> 11:19.263
Hi, Kenny. Hi, Keith.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.015
Oh, hey, Mrs. White.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.727
If you're free tomorrow,
you should come to the Comedy Store.

11:24.810 --> 11:27.187
That's where me and Kenny
are doing stand-up.

11:27.271 --> 11:31.150
Yeah, as if we don't do
enough standing up... all day long.

11:31.233 --> 11:34.069
-[laughs] Aren't they funny?
-[chuckles nervously]

11:34.153 --> 11:36.655
Hey, have you seen
my baby's favorite blanky?

11:36.739 --> 11:40.701
My "assistant" threw it away by accident.

11:40.784 --> 11:44.830
[in Russian accent] I'm from Russia.
I don't speak English.

11:44.914 --> 11:47.708
Know what I like to say?
The reason they call it Russia

11:47.791 --> 11:49.877
is everyone's rushin'
to get out of there.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.921
You know where I'd like to be rushin'?

11:52.004 --> 11:54.632
Across the street
to Gabrielle Union's pool house.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.425
-She's fine.
-She fine.

12:03.057 --> 12:05.434
-[audience laughing]
-[sighs]

12:06.644 --> 12:07.728
All right, boys.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.648
If you do see that blanky,
please tell my assistant.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.608
You might have
to tell her a few times,

12:12.691 --> 12:14.652
'cause she's dumb as a bowl of borscht.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.153
[Keith] You got it, Mrs. White.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.655
Off to the Browns.

12:17.738 --> 12:18.906
[Mrs. White] Bye, boys.

12:18.989 --> 12:23.160
[in Russian accent] I'm from Russia.
I don't speak English.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.787
-[bell ringing]
-[man] Cut!

12:24.870 --> 12:26.664
[laughing] That was fucking awesome!

12:26.747 --> 12:29.625
Absolutely amazing, you guys.
You're geniuses.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.085
Maria, amazing!

12:31.168 --> 12:32.920
[Maria] <i>It felt great to get laughs,</i>

12:33.003 --> 12:35.798
<i>but I wondered if this show</i>
<i>was racially insensitive.</i>

12:35.881 --> 12:39.009
<i>This time, I wouldn't roll over,</i>
<i>like I did with Checklist.</i>

12:39.093 --> 12:40.928
-Hey.
-[gasping] Oh!

12:41.011 --> 12:42.054
Oh!

12:43.555 --> 12:44.598
[crunching] Hi, Maria.

12:44.682 --> 12:47.768
-I'm just eating carrots.
-Oh, hey, Jennipher Nickles.

12:47.851 --> 12:48.978
No, I'm fine.

12:49.061 --> 12:51.105
Listen, I was wondering...

12:51.188 --> 12:53.023
does this show make
you uncomfortable?

12:54.191 --> 12:59.113
I mean, the two lead minority characters
are playing garbage people,

12:59.196 --> 13:01.240
and all the producers are white.

13:01.323 --> 13:03.283
I've been out of the swing of things,

13:03.367 --> 13:05.160
but it seems a little demeaning.

13:05.244 --> 13:07.913
Is that weird?
I mean, are we sellouts?

13:07.997 --> 13:10.207
Jesus! Is this a fucking racist show?

13:10.290 --> 13:12.459
My brand can't handle another fuck-up.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.546
Let's just ask Kenny and Keith.
They'll know.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.298
Right? If it is,
they'll be the ones to know.

13:18.382 --> 13:20.926
No. We can't bother them
with our problems.

13:21.010 --> 13:23.721
It's like, we... just keep it light.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.055
-Light?
-Yeah.

13:25.139 --> 13:27.683
-White, keep it light.
-Hey, Kenny, Keith.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.643
Hey, what's up.

13:29.727 --> 13:33.605
How are the kids? Thank you so much
for letting me be a part of this show.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.065
Did you have a new car?

13:35.149 --> 13:37.276
-What?
-Uh, I... I don't know.

13:37.359 --> 13:39.111
[stammering]

13:39.194 --> 13:40.988
[in accent] Me no speak English.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.531
[Maria chuckling]

13:42.614 --> 13:44.616
Method actor. Party of one.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.035
[chuckling]

13:48.203 --> 13:51.123
-All right, we will... see you later?
-Oh, yes.

13:51.206 --> 13:54.835
-[chuckling] Hi. I mean, bye.
-[Maria] Still look nice.

13:54.918 --> 13:57.087
God, they're great guys.
They're so great.

13:57.171 --> 13:58.380
They are great.

13:58.464 --> 14:01.008
Somebody's got to stand up
and say something.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.676
I mean, this is not right.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.429
Children have to see
a positive representation of race.

14:06.764 --> 14:09.391
-I'm gonna go talk to the head heeb.
-[gasps]

14:11.185 --> 14:13.062
[grunting] Making a difference.

14:15.314 --> 14:17.524
[Maria] <i>I wasn't as </i>
<i>far down my recovery path</i>

14:17.608 --> 14:19.860
<i>as I thought,</i>
<i>but my family was there for me.</i>

14:19.943 --> 14:22.154
<i>It even inspired my dad</i>
<i>to develop a hobby,</i>

14:22.279 --> 14:25.657
<i>where he was able to take</i>
<i>a young local teen under his wing.</i>

14:28.160 --> 14:31.372
Jeremy, no matter what happens
with this apprenticeship,

14:31.538 --> 14:33.415
it's been an honor cobbling next to you.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.793
Suck a dick, monkey-fucker.

14:36.627 --> 14:39.004
Hey, buddy.
Can we talk for a second?

14:39.088 --> 14:41.298
Can you talk with my dick in your mouth?

14:41.382 --> 14:42.883
-Ooh...
-[knocking on door]

14:42.966 --> 14:44.635
[Marilyn] Hi. Hi.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.261
Oh.

14:46.345 --> 14:51.266
Well, I sure feel like a heel...
stopping by the cobble shop unannounced.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.518
Get it?

14:52.601 --> 14:55.729
What are you doing here?
I'm getting through to this tough nut.

14:55.813 --> 14:57.815
[Marilyn] I wanted to see
what was so important

14:57.898 --> 15:02.277
that you'd leave your daughter sitting
in a pool of her own drool for.

15:02.361 --> 15:05.823
You know, Maria Bamford,
your one and only loin-fruit?

15:05.906 --> 15:09.243
-Marilyn, this is not a good time.
-Oh...

15:09.326 --> 15:13.539
So, this is the famous Jeremy. Hi.

15:13.622 --> 15:17.459
I'm Marilyn Bamford, Joel's wife
and good friend. It's a pleasure.

15:17.543 --> 15:19.670
I thought you were
strictly-dickly on Grindr.

15:20.462 --> 15:23.090
It's a gay app.
Uh, listen, pally,

15:23.173 --> 15:26.552
you better hope that bullpucky
of yours comes in a six-pack,

15:26.635 --> 15:28.470
'cause you're gonna have to can it.

15:28.554 --> 15:30.389
Eat a bowl of dog shit.

15:31.682 --> 15:32.808
Whoa!

15:32.891 --> 15:34.268
[man] Jeremy, we gotta get going.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.312
Is that your father?

15:37.396 --> 15:40.816
Would you tell him Marilyn Bamford
would like a word with him?

15:40.899 --> 15:42.693
Me, too. Joel Bamford.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.570
Uh, Dad.

15:44.653 --> 15:48.115
Some geezer faggot
and his dyke beard wanna talk to you.

15:48.198 --> 15:49.491
Whoa!
No feet.

15:50.451 --> 15:52.369
[gasps] Double no feet.

15:52.453 --> 15:54.746
We have feet, you cocklicker.
They don't work.

15:54.830 --> 15:58.500
I'm Marilyn Bamford,
and this is Joel Bamford,

15:58.584 --> 16:01.253
-my husband and good friend.
-Fag.

16:01.336 --> 16:05.591
And your son, here, has a sailor mouth
that belongs on the poop deck.

16:05.674 --> 16:09.219
[crying] Nothing sadder than
a cobbler making shoes for no feet.

16:09.303 --> 16:12.681
What's going on?
Jeremy, we're late for your DUI class.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.892
I get it, Jeremy.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.477
I get your rage now.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.812
I should have asked about your home life.

16:19.730 --> 16:22.691
I'm withdrawing from the apprenticeship.
You can have it.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.526
I'd no idea what you'd been through.

16:24.610 --> 16:25.861
What he's been through?

16:27.070 --> 16:28.614
What the fuck's he been through?

16:28.697 --> 16:32.367
What you've been through
with your feet, or useful lack thereof.

16:32.451 --> 16:34.203
You feel sorry for us?

16:35.412 --> 16:36.872
We feel sorry for you

16:36.955 --> 16:38.749
with the crazy fuck-nut at home.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.584
You take that back!

16:40.667 --> 16:43.128
That what you said
when your cuckoo-retard-daughter

16:43.212 --> 16:45.130
squirted out your
wife's smelly rot box?

16:45.214 --> 16:47.424
-[screams] Whoa!
-Whoa!

16:47.508 --> 16:49.134
She is not a cuckoo-retard.

16:49.218 --> 16:50.969
Even if she was, that would be fine.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.430
She has a mental illness. Bipolar II,

16:53.514 --> 16:57.267
defined as long-term depression
with agitated hypomania.

16:57.351 --> 16:59.353
-It does not define her.
-No, it does not.

16:59.436 --> 17:02.981
-Oh, suck a dick. Jeez!
-No, you suck a dick, young man.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.148
My dick.

17:04.233 --> 17:06.652
My giant, grown-up,
I-served-in-the-navy dick.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.445
Poop talk begins at home.

17:09.530 --> 17:11.073
Come on, let's get out of here.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.575
This crap sandwich
doesn't deserve our attention.

17:13.659 --> 17:16.118
And there's a little girl
at home that needs me.

17:25.671 --> 17:26.922
[Joel] Hey, jelly bean.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.133
I think I owe you an apology.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.719
I threw myself into Jeremy's life,

17:32.803 --> 17:35.514
so I'd have an excuse
for not dealing with yours.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.016
And in the process...

17:38.100 --> 17:40.978
I lost track of what
I had always loved about cobbling.

17:41.812 --> 17:42.980
Which is everything.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.607
I'm so sorry.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.611
Turns out,
your father is a big, giant sellout.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.072
No.

17:52.155 --> 17:54.074
Aw, that's sweet of you to say.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.661
But I just want you to know
that I love you...

17:57.744 --> 17:59.538
and I'm always here for you.

18:00.956 --> 18:04.042
So, what do you say we go
get a piece of pie, cake, or...

18:04.126 --> 18:05.961
Dairy Queen or somethin'?

18:06.044 --> 18:07.546
[sniffles]

18:07.629 --> 18:10.299
[whispering] Peanut Buster Parfait.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.968
Dairy Queen, it is.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.596
Come on, little lady,
let's get you dressed.

18:15.679 --> 18:17.347
[sighing and muttering]

18:20.642 --> 18:24.730
[Maria] <i>My dad showed me it was possible</i>
<i>to make up for selling out,</i>

18:24.813 --> 18:28.775
<i>so I was proud to have abolished</i>
<i>offensive stereotypes on my new show.</i>

18:29.860 --> 18:30.944
Hey, guys.

18:31.028 --> 18:35.407
Got anything you wanna unload
into our receptacles?

18:35.490 --> 18:36.825
[audience] Ooh.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.161
Doesn't matter what size it is.

18:39.244 --> 18:42.164
We've got plenty of room in our dumpers.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.749
[audience laughing]

18:43.832 --> 18:45.250
And if it doesn't fit...

18:46.877 --> 18:49.254
we'll just take it in the alley

18:49.338 --> 18:50.797
[all laughing]

18:50.881 --> 18:52.633
Liquids are fine.

18:52.716 --> 18:56.595
Feel free to spray your stuff
all over our brand new cans.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.388
-[audience laughing]
-[bell ringing]

18:58.472 --> 19:02.184
[laughing] Oh, that was so great,
you guys. That was so damn funny.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.435
We're gonna take a break.

19:03.518 --> 19:05.270
We got standards issues to go over,

19:05.354 --> 19:07.356
but I love the trash tits. [laughs]

19:07.439 --> 19:09.024
-That felt good.
-Yeah.

19:09.107 --> 19:11.109
-What did you feel?
-It felt really good.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.361
[audience cheering]

19:12.444 --> 19:15.072
Hey, is everybody excited
to see some <i>White Trash?</i>

19:15.155 --> 19:16.198
[cheering continues]

19:16.281 --> 19:17.908
So, are you guys excited?

19:17.991 --> 19:20.077
Not really.
We're thinking about quitting.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.830
What? I thought the run-through
went so well today.

19:23.914 --> 19:27.084
-We felt totally minimized.
-We lost all our lines.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.795
This was a show
about how we started stand-up.

19:29.878 --> 19:32.089
-But you were so funny.
-[Kenny] Doing what?

19:32.172 --> 19:34.383
-Wearing a suit?
-That's not funny.

19:34.466 --> 19:38.011
Aren't you happy about representing
your race in a powerful way?

19:38.095 --> 19:41.098
No, we don't wanna represent anything.
We're comedians.

19:41.181 --> 19:44.351
-We just wanna be funny.
-Yeah, we love laughter.

19:44.434 --> 19:45.686
Oh...

19:46.603 --> 19:48.522
I did a bad, bad thing.

19:49.564 --> 19:50.982
-You did this?
-Yeah.

19:51.066 --> 19:54.903
I... I put a birdie
in somebody's writing ear,

19:54.986 --> 19:56.780
-and I... oh...
-[sighing]

19:56.863 --> 19:58.699
To sabotage us.
You wanna be the star.

19:58.782 --> 19:59.616
You sold us out.

19:59.700 --> 20:02.577
I was trying to un-sell you out,
that's the thing.

20:02.661 --> 20:04.037
Hey. Fuckin' check it, dudes.

20:04.121 --> 20:05.330
NBC was at the run-through,

20:05.414 --> 20:08.041
they got a major chub
over the show's new direction.

20:08.125 --> 20:11.086
We got 13 episodes.
We're going straight to series!

20:12.170 --> 20:14.548
-Dope. That's great.
-Awesome. That's fantastic.

20:14.631 --> 20:15.507
I can't do it.

20:16.466 --> 20:20.554
I can't look sexy as hell
on the back of a trash truck if it means

20:20.637 --> 20:22.264
selling out people I respect.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.183
Yes, of course I want a pony!

20:26.601 --> 20:30.105
But its cuteness wouldn't
override the ugliness I feel inside.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.483
I thought I was righting an injustice.

20:33.567 --> 20:37.446
But, in fact, I was making
an injustice even worse.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.656
The fuck is she talking about?

20:40.407 --> 20:44.536
Listen, they should be garbage people.
Not me and Jennipher Nickles.

20:44.619 --> 20:45.746
Right, Jennipher?

20:45.829 --> 20:48.165
You know I never
have to work again, right?

20:48.248 --> 20:51.418
I was on a hit sitcom for 11 years.

20:51.501 --> 20:53.545
I was the voice of Kitten the Car.

20:53.628 --> 20:56.882
That is NBC-you-later money.

20:56.965 --> 20:59.217
I am only here for the craft services...

21:00.385 --> 21:02.512
and the camaraderie.

21:02.596 --> 21:04.514
[laughing]

21:04.598 --> 21:05.891
Josh...

21:05.974 --> 21:07.684
we quit!

21:07.768 --> 21:11.938
And everyone, there's something
that's a lot more important than money.

21:12.022 --> 21:14.691
-[yells] It's justice!
-Whoo-hoo!

21:15.400 --> 21:17.944
We did it! We did it!

21:18.028 --> 21:19.780
-Whoo!
-We didn't sell out!

21:19.863 --> 21:22.032
-[all laughing]
-Wait.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.284
-[Maria] Oh. What?
-[man] Cut!

21:24.367 --> 21:26.453
Is that how we're gonna end the show?

21:26.536 --> 21:28.580
Yeah, and then I was gonna ride off

21:28.663 --> 21:32.334
[sing-song] triumphantly...
[normal] off the back of a garbage truck.

21:32.417 --> 21:36.171
-But you didn't solve anything.
-Yeah, I thought we... did.

21:36.254 --> 21:38.632
We said a lot of
important things about race.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.008
Like what?

21:40.091 --> 21:43.136
Well... like...

21:43.220 --> 21:44.805
You know, just a...

21:44.888 --> 21:46.640
Uh...

21:47.724 --> 21:49.142
Little help...

21:49.226 --> 21:52.187
Academy Award-winning
screenwriter John Ridley?

21:52.270 --> 21:56.024
Oh, I wish I could help you on this one,
but you're on your own.

21:56.107 --> 21:58.360
Okay, but you see
what I'm trying to do here.

21:58.443 --> 22:02.113
You know, trying to say something
about race.

22:02.197 --> 22:03.824
I... I wanna do the right thing.

22:03.907 --> 22:08.161
I don't think what you're doing is
malicious, it's just recklessly ignorant.

22:08.245 --> 22:11.081
Really?
Okay, all right.

22:12.249 --> 22:15.502
But that... that's a place to start.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.003
-Enough!
-Oh, God!

22:17.087 --> 22:22.467
[in British accent]
I do not need this meta-bollocks rubbish.

22:22.551 --> 22:25.345
I am a two-time BAFTA award winner.

22:26.096 --> 22:29.182
I know the Queen,
and I know the Queen's corgis.

22:29.266 --> 22:30.850
Let me tell you, Miss Maria.

22:30.934 --> 22:33.311
They are both lesser bitches than you.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.105
You think this is material?

22:35.230 --> 22:36.690
I have been Medea...

22:37.482 --> 22:39.109
Lady Macbeth...

22:39.192 --> 22:41.736
[Maria] <i>Why is Mira Sorvino</i>
<i>speaking in a British accent?</i>

22:41.820 --> 22:43.697
"All the perfumes of Arabia..."

22:43.780 --> 22:46.366
<i>She didn't wanna play herself.</i>
<i>Who is she playing?</i>

22:46.449 --> 22:49.369
...job is because Benedict Cumberbatch
told me...

22:49.452 --> 22:51.871
[Maria] <i>I love Mira Sorvino so much.</i>

22:51.955 --> 22:53.623
<i>I wonder if we'll end up</i>
<i>being friends.</i>

22:53.707 --> 22:56.209
...so all you cunts can get stuffed!

22:58.086 --> 23:00.255
-[Maria] <i>Probably not.</i>
-She's a good actress.

23:00.338 --> 23:01.965
-Yeah.
-[Keith] Great actress.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.091
[Maria] She really is.

23:03.174 --> 23:06.136
-I should go do that garbage truck scene.
-Oh, yeah.

23:06.219 --> 23:08.054
I can't believe this episode was

23:08.138 --> 23:10.890
about race. They introduced me,
then I just disappeared.

23:10.974 --> 23:13.351
Well, it was written by a bunch
of white people

23:13.435 --> 23:15.395
who I think were good-intentioned.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.646
I don't know.

23:16.730 --> 23:18.231
They got a problem with the Jews.

23:18.315 --> 23:20.358
It's a daunting task for anybody

23:20.442 --> 23:24.112
to try to tackle an examination
of race relations in America.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.781
I barely scratched the surface
in <i>12 Years a Slave,</i>

23:26.865 --> 23:27.699
an entire movie.

23:27.782 --> 23:29.743
The key thing about race is...

23:29.826 --> 23:32.037
-is that we--
-Later, gators!

23:32.120 --> 23:34.205
Oh, boy.

23:34.289 --> 23:37.125
Did... did I interrupt?
What were you saying?

23:37.208 --> 23:39.377
-I've lost my thought.
-[Maria] Ah...

23:40.128 --> 23:42.797
I am so sorry, John Ridley.

23:42.881 --> 23:46.343
This show could have been
about something, and I blew it.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.429
-I'm a horrible person.
-No.

23:49.512 --> 23:53.600
You know what? Maria, you're fine.
You tried and that's something.

23:53.683 --> 23:56.978
Thank you.
That is something!

23:57.062 --> 24:00.190
-It's not that much.
-And that's enough for me!

24:00.273 --> 24:01.900
[laughing]

24:06.529 --> 24:09.115
Hey, gang, we did it!

24:09.199 --> 24:14.412
We told a story about
very sensitive racial issues in America!

24:14.496 --> 24:16.498
And we hit it out of the park!

24:16.581 --> 24:18.416
Highland Park!

24:18.500 --> 24:23.004
Hope you enjoyed the lesson!
Go out and spread it!

24:23.088 --> 24:26.758
I love you!
You're welcome!

24:28.885 --> 24:31.262
Mira Sorvino! Hi.

24:31.346 --> 24:34.140
I am so thankful that you could be
on the show.

24:34.224 --> 24:36.851
Thanks, Maria.
It was really fun, I loved it.

24:36.935 --> 24:39.229
Oh... I just had a quick acting question.

24:39.312 --> 24:42.482
How many layers were you playing
during that part?

24:42.565 --> 24:45.443
So there is Millicent Pratt,
the British actress,

24:45.527 --> 24:47.821
playing American actress,
Jennipher Nickles,

24:47.904 --> 24:49.948
playing herself
playing Mrs. White

24:50.031 --> 24:51.700
on the sitcom, <i>White Trash.</i>

24:51.783 --> 24:53.743
Wow, that is deep.
All right.

24:53.827 --> 24:57.956
And now, another layer,
Mira Sorvino, the real one.

24:58.748 --> 25:02.043
Well... who's to say what is real, Maria?

25:03.002 --> 25:06.423
Yeah. Yeah! [laughing]

25:06.506 --> 25:08.758
-[engine starts]
-[gasping]

25:14.973 --> 25:19.936
[choir singing]
<i>♪ I don't know what I'm doing ♪</i>

25:20.061 --> 25:21.730
<i>♪ More than half of the time ♪</i>

25:21.855 --> 25:23.982
Bye, Mira Sorvino!
