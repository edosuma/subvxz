00:00.602 --> 00:02.596
(Announcer)
Previously on Hell's Kitchen.

00:02.597 --> 00:04.606
We got black jackets!

00:04.607 --> 00:06.773
Who looks good in black?
I do!

00:06.774 --> 00:10.066
(Announcer) After an evening of celebration
over receiving black jackets...

00:10.067 --> 00:12.384
The stakes are definitely higher.
I'm ready to win this whole thing.

00:12.385 --> 00:14.518
(Announcer) Everyone had
their eye on the prize.

00:14.519 --> 00:15.986
No more playing around.

00:15.987 --> 00:16.987
(Announcer)
Early the next morning...

00:16.988 --> 00:18.035
Everybody ready?
(All) Yes, chef.

00:18.036 --> 00:19.939
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay
decided it was time

00:19.940 --> 00:22.092
for one of
his most difficult challenges.

00:22.093 --> 00:24.161
It's now time
for Taste It, Now Make It.

00:24.162 --> 00:26.550
(Announcer) But this time,
he added a little twist...

00:26.551 --> 00:28.795
You'll be working
and competing in pairs.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.536
(Announcer) Clemenza and Dana...
There's some sort of wine in it.

00:31.537 --> 00:32.951
(Christina) I think it's that one.
Yup.

00:32.952 --> 00:33.684
Port.
Port.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.245
(Announcer) Chose a different path.
Madeira.

00:35.246 --> 00:36.832
Madeira!
And I'm, like, "shh."

00:36.833 --> 00:37.975
(Announcer) And it paid off.

00:37.976 --> 00:39.484
Dana, Clemenza.
You had the madeira.

00:39.485 --> 00:40.788
Congratulations.
[Cheering]

00:40.789 --> 00:42.696
Yes, yes, yes.

00:42.697 --> 00:43.756
(Announcer) The next morning...

00:43.757 --> 00:44.782
Come around.
Let's go.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.939
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay had
another difficult challenge

00:46.940 --> 00:48.282
for the final six.

00:48.283 --> 00:51.388
Tonight,
you will be competing against

00:51.389 --> 00:53.190
runners-up
of Hell's Kitchen.

00:53.191 --> 00:57.027
<i>(Gordon) Paula, Jay, Bonnie,
Kevin, Virginia, Russell.</i>

00:57.028 --> 00:58.863
Somebody's going home.

00:58.864 --> 01:00.642
(Announcer) That brought
out the competitive spirit

01:00.643 --> 01:01.439
of the black team.

01:01.440 --> 01:02.737
You guys are all
definitely going home.

01:02.738 --> 01:03.704
(Russell) Your ass is gone.

01:03.705 --> 01:05.695
I hope he goes down harder
than anybody on that team.

01:05.696 --> 01:08.345
(Announcer) The returning chefs...
I want to win.

01:08.346 --> 01:09.940
(Announcer)
Were out for redemption.

01:09.941 --> 01:10.841
Five to the window.
Five in the window.

01:10.842 --> 01:11.942
(Virginia) Got it.

01:11.943 --> 01:13.344
I've never seen food
this immaculate

01:13.345 --> 01:14.645
leave the red kitchen.

01:14.646 --> 01:16.580
(Announcer) And the black team
was ready to do battle.

01:16.581 --> 01:17.961
Let's just egg them.
[Laughs]

01:17.962 --> 01:20.851
(Announcer) But Robyn put the
team off to a slow start.

01:20.852 --> 01:22.019
<i>(Gordon) Robyn,</i>

01:22.020 --> 01:23.687
I want
more salad dressing on it.

01:23.688 --> 01:26.056
Robyn, all you had to do
was put dressing on leaves.

01:26.057 --> 01:27.093
(Announcer)
And then Clemenza...

01:27.094 --> 01:28.064
What are you doing?

01:28.065 --> 01:30.761
(Announcer) Began working on
dishes that weren't even on order.

01:30.762 --> 01:31.962
I got your lobster.

01:31.963 --> 01:33.964
How come you've been doing
something that's not on order?

01:33.965 --> 01:35.899
(Announcer) Barbie was
outstanding on meat

01:35.900 --> 01:37.434
and helped
pull the team together.

01:37.435 --> 01:39.503
Beautifully cooked, Barbie.
(Barbie) Thank you, chef.

01:39.504 --> 01:41.105
Right now, it's neck and neck.

01:41.106 --> 01:43.207
(Announcer) Although both
teams had excellent services.

01:43.208 --> 01:45.976
The winning team tonight is...

01:45.977 --> 01:47.277
Our returning runners-up.

01:47.278 --> 01:48.045
<i>Great job.
Well done.</i>

01:48.046 --> 01:49.513
[Applause]

01:49.514 --> 01:51.749
(Announcer) The black team
came up a little short,

01:51.750 --> 01:53.384
and they had to nominate
two chefs for elimination.

01:53.385 --> 01:55.386
(Announcer) They chose...
Robyn.

01:55.387 --> 01:57.655
(Announcer) And...
Clemenza, chef.

01:57.656 --> 02:00.124
(Announcer) In the end, it was...
Robyn.

02:00.125 --> 02:01.792
<i>(Announcer) Who had her volatile
ride in Hell's Kitchen</i>

02:01.793 --> 02:03.861
come to an end.
Get out of here.

02:03.862 --> 02:05.496
(Announcer) But chef
Ramsay had a warning...

02:05.497 --> 02:06.664
Clemenza.

02:06.665 --> 02:08.899
I don't look at you
and see Vegas.

02:08.900 --> 02:11.035
(Announcer) That Clemenza knows
he needs to take seriously...

02:11.036 --> 02:13.337
I'll tattoo a slot machine
on my ass if it helps.

02:13.338 --> 02:15.472
(Announcer) If he wants to
become the next head chef

02:15.473 --> 02:19.710
at Gordon Ramsay's Steak
at Paris, Las Vegas.

Now get out of here.

03:18.670 --> 03:20.804
(Clemenza) Yes, chef.

03:23.541 --> 03:24.708
[Barbie screeching]

03:24.709 --> 03:26.510
It was her time, dude.
Yup.

03:26.511 --> 03:28.345
It was her time,
a long time before that.

03:28.346 --> 03:31.348
Normally, walking
out of elimination

03:31.349 --> 03:34.418
is a little depressing,
but tonight,

03:34.419 --> 03:36.854
we are walking out minus Robyn.

03:36.855 --> 03:39.156
(Barbie) Yes, bring it, C.

03:39.157 --> 03:40.424
And it feels so good.

03:40.425 --> 03:41.458
(Barbie) It's such a relief.

03:41.459 --> 03:44.595
[Laughter]

03:44.596 --> 03:47.364
I was never happy
to see someone go until today.

03:47.365 --> 03:50.000
(Justin) I didn't want to
work with her anymore.

03:50.001 --> 03:51.735
Now you know how we felt,
how happy were we

03:51.736 --> 03:52.736
when she moved to your team.

03:52.737 --> 03:54.438
Yeah.

03:54.439 --> 03:56.440
(Christina) Clemenza, I'm glad
you're still here, buddy.

03:56.441 --> 03:58.108
It was just a mind [bleep].

03:58.109 --> 03:59.910
I get put up again
for elimination,

03:59.911 --> 04:01.578
and it actually lit a spark,

04:01.579 --> 04:02.679
so you're gonna see
a whole new Clemenza tomorrow.

04:02.680 --> 04:03.947
Fab five.

04:03.948 --> 04:05.349
Watch out,
tomorrow, I'm gonna coming in

04:05.350 --> 04:06.750
<i>with a vengeance.</i>

04:06.751 --> 04:08.452
<i>(Justin) I'm excited
for tomorrow.</i>

04:08.453 --> 04:09.586
The stakes
are at the highest point

04:09.587 --> 04:11.121
they've ever been right now.

04:11.122 --> 04:13.157
There's some strong competition
in the final five,

04:13.158 --> 04:14.892
but I gotta step it up
as hard as I can.

04:14.893 --> 04:18.195
<i>(Dana) There's only five of us.
(Christina) I know.</i>

04:18.196 --> 04:20.164
(Announcer) Each of the chefs
are clearly considering

04:20.165 --> 04:22.166
how they can stay one step ahead
of the competition.

04:22.167 --> 04:25.803
Please don't snore.

04:27.038 --> 04:29.106
Whoo hoo!

04:29.107 --> 04:30.307
Let's do it.

04:30.308 --> 04:32.309
(Announcer) But this morning...

04:32.310 --> 04:34.211
(Gordon) It'll be nice to
give you a little treat.

04:34.212 --> 04:35.612
(Announcer) They are all focused
on trying to figure out

04:35.613 --> 04:38.048
what chef Ramsay
has up his sleeve.

04:38.049 --> 04:40.818
Why don't I cook you
something delicious?

04:40.819 --> 04:42.786
<i>Some comfort food.</i>

04:42.787 --> 04:44.454
When we think of comfort foods,

04:44.455 --> 04:46.156
<i>I think about...</i>

04:46.157 --> 04:47.157
Chicken parm.

04:47.158 --> 04:48.559
Yes.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.627
I don't know what's happening,
but chicken parm.

04:50.628 --> 04:52.529
Come on, chicken,
marinara sauce, mozzarell.

04:52.530 --> 04:54.331
Doesn't get better than that.

04:54.332 --> 04:55.699
The secret of a good sauce
marinara, Clemenza, is what?

04:55.700 --> 04:57.634
Garlic, onions, tomatoes...

04:57.635 --> 04:58.936
come on, put heat in there.

04:58.937 --> 05:00.137
Little bit of chili, yup.

05:00.138 --> 05:01.104
<i>How much?
Keep... keep going.</i>

05:01.105 --> 05:02.873
[Laughter]

05:02.874 --> 05:03.974
Fresh tomatoes.

05:03.975 --> 05:05.242
Okay, chicken breast.

05:05.243 --> 05:06.777
Butterflies.
Pound it.

05:06.778 --> 05:08.078
Nice and light.

05:08.079 --> 05:10.047
I'm watching every little thing

05:10.048 --> 05:13.450
because chef Ramsay doesn't
just cook us chicken parm

05:13.451 --> 05:15.052
to cook us chicken parm.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.353
We're being tested on this.

05:16.354 --> 05:17.354
Really crisp.

05:17.355 --> 05:18.622
Yes, chef.
Yes, chef.

05:18.623 --> 05:19.656
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

05:19.657 --> 05:20.524
There's got to be a catch.

05:20.525 --> 05:21.892
All right, chef Ramsay,

05:21.893 --> 05:23.393
what is it?
What have you got today?

05:23.394 --> 05:24.194
And there we go.
Dig in.

05:24.195 --> 05:25.295
Have a little taste.
Please.

05:25.296 --> 05:26.363
<i>(Gordon) Mmm.</i>

05:26.364 --> 05:27.965
It's, like, really?

05:27.966 --> 05:29.766
My chicken parm will blow that
out the [bleep] water.

05:29.767 --> 05:31.001
I'll have my people
call your people

05:31.002 --> 05:32.135
and we'll do lunch.

05:32.136 --> 05:33.537
And I'll show
you how it's done.

05:33.538 --> 05:34.872
You saw me make it, right?

05:34.873 --> 05:36.907
Simple comfort delicious food.

05:36.908 --> 05:37.908
Good.

05:37.909 --> 05:39.309
For your next challenge,

05:39.310 --> 05:41.745
I would like
each of you to produce

05:41.746 --> 05:45.983
the exact duplicate
of my chicken parmesan.

05:45.984 --> 05:47.751
I knew it.
See, all right, here we go.

05:47.752 --> 05:48.886
I'm amped up.
Bring it on, let's go.

05:48.887 --> 05:50.721
Easy?
(All) Yes, chef.

05:50.722 --> 05:52.222
Yes.

05:52.223 --> 05:53.557
Fact is, it's way too easy.

05:53.558 --> 05:54.892
<i>Isn't it?
Yeah.</i>

05:54.893 --> 05:59.329
That's why today
you won't actually be making it.

05:59.330 --> 06:02.633
You'll be teaching
someone else how to make it.

06:02.634 --> 06:05.235
<i>It's now time for
Hell's Kitchen cooking school.</i>

06:05.236 --> 06:06.303
Okay.
That's awesome.

06:06.304 --> 06:07.537
Yeah.

06:07.538 --> 06:10.073
(Dana) I love teaching.

06:10.074 --> 06:12.676
This is what I do.
I teach people how to cook.

06:12.677 --> 06:14.077
Are you ready
to meet your students?

06:14.078 --> 06:15.245
(All) Yes, chef.

06:15.246 --> 06:20.350
Give a warm welcome
to Miss Teen USA 2010.

06:20.351 --> 06:21.418
[Applause]

06:21.419 --> 06:23.053
Oh, my goodness.

06:23.054 --> 06:24.755
Right away,
I pushed my patience button.

06:24.756 --> 06:26.223
Ding.

06:26.224 --> 06:28.525
<i>(Gordon) Miss Teen USA 2008.</i>

06:28.526 --> 06:30.160
In walked
the most beautiful young ladies

06:30.161 --> 06:31.461
I've ever seen in my life.

06:31.462 --> 06:32.963
It was a little mind-blowing.

06:32.964 --> 06:34.932
<i>(Gordon) Miss Teen USA 2007.</i>

06:34.933 --> 06:36.934
Mind you,
they're Miss Teen USA.

06:36.935 --> 06:38.568
I wasn't thinking
anything crazy.

06:38.569 --> 06:40.737
<i>(Gordon) Miss Teen USA 2006.</i>

06:40.738 --> 06:42.439
Oh, God.

06:42.440 --> 06:46.376
Each of them are wearing,
like, 6-inch heels.

06:46.377 --> 06:49.146
<i>(Gordon) Miss Teen USA 2005.</i>

06:49.147 --> 06:52.282
You girls are not
dressed to cook today.

06:52.283 --> 06:53.717
Lovely ladies,

06:53.718 --> 06:55.586
<i>uh, first of all,
thank you so much</i>

06:55.587 --> 06:56.286
for making the kitchen
look so glamorous.

06:56.287 --> 06:57.421
[Laughter]

06:57.422 --> 06:58.922
<i>(Gordon) Chefs,</i>

06:58.923 --> 07:02.359

are your students.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.594
<i>(Gordon) Okay? Hi, there.</i>

07:03.595 --> 07:04.395
<i>That's right.</i>

07:04.396 --> 07:05.696
<i>You must recreate</i>

07:05.697 --> 07:09.199
my chicken parm, 100% now.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.701
<i>(Gordon) Chefs, each of you</i>

07:10.702 --> 07:12.036
cannot touch any ingredient.

07:12.037 --> 07:14.104
<i>All you can do is teach.</i>

07:14.105 --> 07:15.105
Oh, God.

07:15.106 --> 07:17.107
Students, are you ready?
(All) Yes, chef.

07:17.108 --> 07:18.108
Great.

Now. [Squeals]
Off you go.

07:24.916 --> 07:25.682
Go.
Let's go.

07:25.683 --> 07:26.950
All right, move back over here.

07:26.951 --> 07:28.719
<i>(Barbie) No running.</i>

07:28.720 --> 07:30.287
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay has selected
this cooking school challenge

07:30.288 --> 07:31.655
to test the chef's ability

07:31.656 --> 07:33.557
to communicate,
lead, and teach...

07:33.558 --> 07:35.426
Tell me what to do, girlfriend.

07:35.427 --> 07:37.094
(Announcer) Essential
skills for a head chef.

07:37.095 --> 07:38.462
Cut it, like,
once, twice, three times,

07:38.463 --> 07:40.164
and then go across.

07:40.165 --> 07:41.932
(Announcer) The chefs can
supervise their students...

07:41.933 --> 07:43.734
I really can't touch
anything, huh?

07:43.735 --> 07:45.936
(Announcer) But they're not allowed
to do any of the hands-on cooking.

07:45.937 --> 07:47.404
As thin as you possibly can.

07:47.405 --> 07:48.305
Watch your fingers.
Yeah, I know.

07:48.306 --> 07:49.907
Don't worry about it.

07:49.908 --> 07:52.076
Let's start by cutting
the top of the onion off.

07:52.077 --> 07:53.410
Oh. All right, perfect.

07:53.411 --> 07:54.778
Okay?
Yeah, mince that.

07:54.779 --> 07:56.914
Mince the onion?

07:56.915 --> 08:00.050
Like, isn't there, like,
a machine you can use for that?

08:00.051 --> 08:01.752
Oh, my God.
Open her up.

08:01.753 --> 08:03.120
It's a good thing
I'm not a vegetarian.

08:03.121 --> 08:04.054
Definitely is.

08:04.055 --> 08:05.389
I had no idea
we had a whole chicken

08:05.390 --> 08:06.490
that she had to break down.

08:06.491 --> 08:07.624
Ooh...
Flip it over.

08:07.625 --> 08:08.859
[Squeals]

08:08.860 --> 08:10.194
She's gonna cut
her [bleep] finger off.

08:10.195 --> 08:11.328
Perfect.

08:11.329 --> 08:12.996
I can't believe
my pageant girl...

08:12.997 --> 08:14.965
she's looking good
with that raw chicken.

08:14.966 --> 08:16.033
She's handling it.

08:16.034 --> 08:19.002
Wow.
That's awesome.

08:19.003 --> 08:21.171
Do you know how to open wine?
Give it a good cut,

08:21.172 --> 08:22.539
and you'll be able to rip it.
Just be careful.

08:22.540 --> 08:24.741
Okay, and I need
to get my thongs.

08:24.742 --> 08:25.742
Tongs, tongs.
Tongs?

08:25.743 --> 08:27.744
[Laughing]

08:27.745 --> 08:30.848
[Chuckling]

08:30.849 --> 08:32.916
You're doing, like, really,
really good, honestly.

08:32.917 --> 08:34.150
You know what
it's like to cook in heels?

08:34.152 --> 08:34.828
[Laughs]

08:34.828 --> 08:37.453
(Announcer) While most of the teams
have started their marinara sauce...

08:37.455 --> 08:40.289
Let's come over to the sauce
and check the sauce.

08:40.291 --> 08:41.859
(Announcer) And are preparing
to cook the chicken...

08:41.860 --> 08:42.693
Take off the bread crumbs

08:42.693 --> 08:43.994
<i>to get them
where you need them.</i>

08:43.995 --> 08:45.229
(Announcer) One pair...

08:45.230 --> 08:46.730
You see the onion skin?

08:46.731 --> 08:48.265
(Announcer) Is falling
behind on the assignment.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.399
Can you get that hair?

08:49.400 --> 08:50.801
God, yeah.
Thank you.

08:50.802 --> 08:52.536
Dude, they better
hurry up over there.

08:52.537 --> 08:55.506
Barbie and Hilary
are still dicing an onion.

08:55.507 --> 08:56.640
Ten minutes to go.

08:56.641 --> 08:58.275
Kid, we gotta rock now.

08:58.276 --> 08:59.543
Okay.

08:59.544 --> 09:01.378
I am getting a little anxious
with the time,

09:01.379 --> 09:04.648
but this is
chef Ramsay's chicken parmesan.

09:04.649 --> 09:07.117
It has to be perfect.

09:07.118 --> 09:08.152
All right, we can do it.

09:08.153 --> 09:09.153
Taste this one.

09:09.154 --> 09:11.722
[Gags]

09:11.723 --> 09:13.090
You're good, you're good.

09:13.091 --> 09:14.625
Not used to green vegetables.

09:14.626 --> 09:16.460
30 seconds to go.

09:16.461 --> 09:18.595
<i>(Gordon) Let's go, ladies.</i>

09:18.596 --> 09:20.264
We really have to hustle.

09:20.265 --> 09:23.400
I'm panicking.
That time is going so fast.

09:23.401 --> 09:25.435
There's no way that
we're going to make it.

09:25.436 --> 09:26.803
All we got to do is
get the chicken on the plate.

09:26.804 --> 09:27.538
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

09:27.539 --> 09:28.572
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

09:28.573 --> 09:30.007
Go, go, go, go, go. [Yelps]

09:30.008 --> 09:31.408
<i>(Gordon) Three...</i>

09:31.409 --> 09:34.344
<i>Wait, wait.
Two...One...</i>

09:34.345 --> 09:36.346
<i>And serve.
Let's go, ladies.</i>

09:36.347 --> 09:37.848
<i>(Barbie) Nice.</i>

09:37.849 --> 09:39.550
(Announcer)
With the cooking complete...

09:39.551 --> 09:40.817
First up,
Christina and Katie, please.

09:40.818 --> 09:41.985
Let's go.

09:41.986 --> 09:44.188
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay
will now determine

09:44.189 --> 09:45.722
which of the chefs has been
the most effective teacher.

09:45.723 --> 09:47.558
Love it.
Here we go.

09:47.559 --> 09:49.126
Okay, uh...

09:49.127 --> 09:51.428
<i>Comparison, side-by-side,
which I like to see.</i>

09:51.429 --> 09:54.398
We had a big breast, I think.
You had a what?

09:54.399 --> 09:55.399
Big breast.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.635
Big breast?
Mm-hmm.

09:58.636 --> 09:59.636
Uh...

09:59.637 --> 10:02.172
[Laughs]

10:02.173 --> 10:03.507
The chicken's cooked perfectly.

10:03.508 --> 10:05.008
Moist.
Delicious.

10:05.009 --> 10:07.477
I would have preferred to see
a touch more marinara sauce

10:07.478 --> 10:11.014
<i>and less of the mozzarella,
but great start.</i>

10:11.015 --> 10:12.849
I am super stoked.

10:12.850 --> 10:14.484
Straight out the gate.
Well done.

10:14.485 --> 10:17.521
(Announcer) With Christina
and Katie setting the bar...

10:17.522 --> 10:19.122
Next up, Justin and Kamie.
Please.

10:19.123 --> 10:22.693
(Announcer) It's now up to Justin
and 2010 Miss Teen USA Kamie

10:22.694 --> 10:24.194
to surpass it.

10:24.195 --> 10:26.997
<i>(Gordon) Visually,
it's got impact.</i>

10:26.998 --> 10:28.699
That sauce is delicious.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.534
Got the right amount of heat.

10:30.535 --> 10:32.636
One criticism... the chicken's
slightly too thick.

10:32.637 --> 10:35.272
(Announcer) With Justin and Kamie's
dish receiving mixed reviews...

10:35.273 --> 10:37.140
Next up, Dana and Allie,
please.

10:37.141 --> 10:38.942
(Announcer)
Dana and her student,

10:38.943 --> 10:42.713
Miss Teen USA 2005 Allie,
take their shot

10:42.714 --> 10:44.815
at impressing chef Ramsay.

10:44.816 --> 10:46.516
Visually...
Beautiful.

10:46.517 --> 10:49.353
What I'm excited about
is that crispiness, here.

10:49.354 --> 10:50.954
Wow.

10:50.955 --> 10:52.823
That amount of mozzarella
becomes a little bit obtrusive,

10:52.824 --> 10:54.191
<i>so it gets in the way.</i>

10:54.192 --> 10:55.892
(Dana) Chef Ramsay,

10:55.893 --> 10:57.294
what is the best part
of chicken parm?

10:57.295 --> 10:58.762
The melted cheese.

10:58.763 --> 11:01.531
There's no such thing as
too much cheese on chicken parm.

11:01.532 --> 11:03.267
However, the sauce is delicious.
Good job.

11:03.268 --> 11:04.901
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

11:04.902 --> 11:06.136
Wow.
Grab this dome.

11:06.137 --> 11:07.804
This is really difficult.

11:07.805 --> 11:09.973
Why can't ever challenge
be as good as this?

11:09.974 --> 11:11.208
[Laughs]

11:11.209 --> 11:13.143
Okay.
Next up, Barbie and Hilary.

11:13.144 --> 11:15.779
Please.
Thank you.

11:15.780 --> 11:17.080
<i>Good.</i>

11:17.081 --> 11:18.849
[Speaking under breath]

11:18.850 --> 11:20.550
It's beautiful.

11:21.753 --> 11:23.453
Delicious.
I mean, it really is.

11:23.454 --> 11:25.022
The sauce is a near perfect.

11:25.023 --> 11:26.189
You just raised the bar
yet again.

11:26.190 --> 11:27.891
Good job.
Thank you.

11:27.892 --> 11:29.760
I think I did
a really good job,

11:29.761 --> 11:32.462
but there is still Clemenza,
and he's Italian.

11:32.463 --> 11:33.664
Last but not least,

11:33.665 --> 11:34.865
Clemenza and Stevi.

11:34.866 --> 11:36.233
<i>(Gordon) Let's go.</i>

11:36.234 --> 11:37.601
Was Clemenza a good teacher?

11:37.602 --> 11:40.170
He was awesome.

11:40.171 --> 11:41.805
When it comes
to certain Italian things,

11:41.806 --> 11:43.407
I think I have marinara sauce

11:43.408 --> 11:45.375
flowing through
my [bleep] veins.

11:45.376 --> 11:46.476
Chicken's cooked perfectly.

11:47.567 --> 11:48.766
<i>(Gordon) The problem
we got is the sauce.</i>

11:48.767 --> 11:50.947
It needs to be blended down
so it's a little bit finer.

11:50.948 --> 11:51.782
It's very chunky.

11:51.783 --> 11:53.417
Well, let me tell you,
chef Ramsay.

11:53.418 --> 11:54.885
You don't know everything.

11:54.886 --> 11:56.486
That's classic marinara.

11:56.487 --> 11:57.821
Thank you.
Thank you.

11:57.822 --> 11:59.356
<i>This is tough.</i>

11:59.357 --> 12:00.857
Very tough, indeed.
Um...

12:00.858 --> 12:03.994
Tell you what,
Hilary and Allie,

12:03.995 --> 12:06.229
I'd like to taste both
your dishes one more time.

12:06.230 --> 12:07.564
<i>Come down, please,
with your dishes.</i>

12:07.565 --> 12:08.665
<i>Thank you.</i>

12:08.666 --> 12:10.067
<i>(Gordon) Yup.</i>

12:10.068 --> 12:12.169
It's coming down
to me and Barbie.

12:12.170 --> 12:13.637
<i>I've really have no idea</i>

12:13.638 --> 12:14.938
<i>who chef Ramsay's
going to pick.</i>

12:14.939 --> 12:16.139
<i>Hoo-hoo.
Yup.</i>

12:17.942 --> 12:19.509
<i>(Gordon) So tough.</i>

12:19.510 --> 12:21.912
<i>Hilary...</i>

12:21.913 --> 12:23.947
That's delicious.

12:23.948 --> 12:25.449
<i>Love the color.</i>

12:25.450 --> 12:27.584
And Allie...

12:27.585 --> 12:29.953
It's still crispy now,
this far down the line.

12:29.954 --> 12:32.289
Mmm.

12:32.290 --> 12:33.873
Tie, chef?
A tie?

12:35.893 --> 12:37.494
The winner is...

12:37.495 --> 12:40.464
[Suspenseful music]

12:48.020 --> 12:50.354
(Announcer) In today's
cooking school challenge...

12:50.355 --> 12:52.023
(Gordon) Hilary and Allie,
I'd like to taste

12:52.024 --> 12:54.058
both your dishes one more time.

12:54.059 --> 12:56.227
(Announcer) The chefs had to
teach Miss Teen USA winners

12:56.228 --> 12:57.862
how to cook chicken parmesan.

12:57.863 --> 12:59.830
<i>(Gordon) It's tough, this one.</i>

12:59.831 --> 13:01.098
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay has
narrowed the field down

13:01.099 --> 13:02.833
to the top two.

13:02.834 --> 13:06.070
It's Dana and Allie
versus Barbie and Hilary.

13:06.071 --> 13:08.439
<i>(Gordon) The winner is...</i>

13:10.809 --> 13:11.809
Hilary.

13:11.810 --> 13:13.544
Congratulations.
Ahh!

13:13.545 --> 13:15.313
<i>(Gordon) Barbie, well done.
Really good job.</i>

13:15.314 --> 13:15.746
<i>Really good job.
Oh, my God.</i>

13:15.747 --> 13:17.915
I won!
Yes!

13:17.916 --> 13:19.985
Really good job, indeed.

13:19.986 --> 13:22.219
I am so proud of Hilary and I.

13:22.220 --> 13:23.754
I know I'm a good leader.

13:23.755 --> 13:25.723
Thank you for coming.
Bye, good luck.

13:25.724 --> 13:28.192
<i>I was a pageant winner, and
now I'm a Hell's Kitchen winner.</i>

13:28.193 --> 13:31.062
And I'm totally going
to put it on my resume.

13:31.063 --> 13:32.330
Barbie, well done.

13:32.331 --> 13:34.365
You are emerging, aren't you?

13:34.366 --> 13:35.800
Patience is a virtue.

13:35.801 --> 13:37.969
"Patience is a virtue"?

13:37.970 --> 13:39.503
Being mediocre
the whole competition?

13:39.504 --> 13:41.639
Was that your strategy?

13:41.640 --> 13:43.007
<i>(Gordon) Okay, tomorrow night</i>

13:43.008 --> 13:44.008
is Italian night.

13:44.009 --> 13:45.409
Yeah.
Yeah.

13:45.410 --> 13:46.444
<i>(Gordon) That's right.</i>

13:46.445 --> 13:47.778
Clemenza.

13:47.779 --> 13:49.614
So Barbie, for today,
I've arranged for you

13:49.615 --> 13:52.316
an amazing
Italian-inspired fun day.

13:52.317 --> 13:55.620
So, tell me who'd
you like to take along with you.

13:55.621 --> 13:57.555
I'm kind of hoping
she doesn't pick me.

13:57.556 --> 13:59.557
Spending a day with Barbie
or a punishment...

13:59.558 --> 14:00.725
hey, I don't know
which one's worse.

14:00.726 --> 14:01.659
Justin.

14:01.660 --> 14:03.327
[Laughs]

14:03.328 --> 14:05.229
<i>(Gordon) You're going to
have an extraordinary lunch</i>

14:05.230 --> 14:06.497
<i>cooked by a unique chef.</i>

14:06.498 --> 14:08.532
Once you finish lunch,
you're going to spend

14:08.533 --> 14:11.035
<i>the afternoon kayaking
in the Venice canals.</i>

14:11.036 --> 14:12.470
Oh, my God.
[Laughs]

14:12.471 --> 14:16.874
Listen,
I have a brand-new Maserati.

14:16.875 --> 14:18.409
<i>I'm handing you the keys.</i>

14:18.410 --> 14:19.677
What?

14:19.678 --> 14:22.947
As a matter of fact,
it's my convertible.

14:22.948 --> 14:24.382
Okay.

14:24.383 --> 14:26.951
Enjoy yourself, yeah?
And bring it back in one piece.

14:26.952 --> 14:28.953
<i>Head upstairs.
Get changed.</i>

14:28.954 --> 14:30.221
(Justin) I definitely didn't
expect Barbie to pick me

14:30.222 --> 14:30.988
to go on this reward.

14:30.989 --> 14:32.957
But from what I've seen lately,

14:32.958 --> 14:34.659
I feel like
we have definitely bonded.

14:34.660 --> 14:35.993
Thank you very much, honestly.

14:35.994 --> 14:37.428
As I've said, tomorrow night

14:37.429 --> 14:38.963
<i>is Italian night
in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

14:38.964 --> 14:41.666
The secret of a good
Italian menu is in the prep,

14:41.667 --> 14:44.035
and we have a huge amount
of work to do,

14:44.036 --> 14:45.603
let me tell you that.

14:45.604 --> 14:47.672
<i>It's going to be
a long and tedious day.</i>

14:47.673 --> 14:50.107
I'm just pissed at myself
right now.

14:50.108 --> 14:52.510
I need to make sure
that I win something soon.

14:52.511 --> 14:54.545
(Clemenza) I just can't picture
Barbie and Justin hanging out.

14:54.546 --> 14:56.580
Oh, that made me so mad
when chef was, like,

14:56.581 --> 14:58.249
"Barbie,
what's happening?"

14:58.250 --> 14:59.850
"Patience is a virtue."

14:59.851 --> 15:02.553
Hey, guys.
See you later.

15:02.554 --> 15:05.556
I'm seeing
this new Barbie emerge,

15:05.557 --> 15:08.826
and I'm guessing
she's had a strategy all along.

15:08.827 --> 15:10.394
Maybe they're falling in love.

15:10.395 --> 15:13.030
She's trying
to build an alliance.

15:13.031 --> 15:14.165
Oh, hell, yeah.
Wow.

15:14.166 --> 15:15.232
Oh, yeah.

15:15.233 --> 15:17.268
Oh, my God, that's gorgeous.

15:17.269 --> 15:19.003
<i>Sick with it.</i>

15:19.004 --> 15:20.137
(Barbie) Wow.

15:20.138 --> 15:21.138
[Engine vs]

15:21.139 --> 15:22.139
Go.

15:22.140 --> 15:25.609
[Engine revs]

15:27.312 --> 15:29.313
[Barbie squeals]

15:29.314 --> 15:31.716
Chef's convertible
is really, really sick.

15:34.486 --> 15:35.886
Thank you for bringing me.
Cheers to that.

15:35.887 --> 15:37.188
I think we did well.

15:37.189 --> 15:38.989
<i>(Antonio) Here we go.</i>

15:38.990 --> 15:42.026
This one is the best creation
of the restaurant.

15:42.027 --> 15:43.861
Best food orgasm, number one.

15:43.862 --> 15:45.029
Shh.

15:45.030 --> 15:46.564
<i>(Antonio)
Food is better than sex</i>

15:46.565 --> 15:47.765
<i>and this one is the dish.</i>

15:47.766 --> 15:49.133
<i>(Barbie) Oh, my God.</i>

15:49.134 --> 15:50.601
Mmm.

15:50.602 --> 15:52.002
So good.

15:52.003 --> 15:53.137
[Sighs]

15:53.138 --> 15:55.773
[Purrs]

15:55.774 --> 15:56.907
Mm-hmm.

15:56.908 --> 15:58.542
I'm so happy
that Barbie chose me.

15:58.543 --> 15:59.910
[Laughs]

15:59.911 --> 16:01.712
Oh, yeah.
That's unbelievable.

16:01.713 --> 16:04.582
<i>(Barbie)
Wow. Ooh...</i>

16:04.583 --> 16:07.752
(Announcer) As Barbie and Justin reach
the climax of their Italian lunch,

16:07.753 --> 16:11.155
<i>back in Hell's Kitchen, one
chef is having a love affair...</i>

16:11.156 --> 16:13.691
We're drying pasta.
It reminds me of the old days

16:13.692 --> 16:14.892
back in Brooklyn.

16:14.893 --> 16:16.060
(Announcer) With his pasta.

16:16.061 --> 16:16.919
(Clemenza) Hey, mambo.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.755
Anybody can make pasta,

16:19.756 --> 16:22.258
but a true Italian artist
can make really good pasta.

16:22.259 --> 16:25.027
Plain and simple.

16:25.028 --> 16:27.129
What is happening here?

16:27.130 --> 16:28.164
Clemenza,

16:28.165 --> 16:29.532
<i>mine won't go through.</i>

16:29.533 --> 16:31.600
Come on, Dana.
What are you doing?

16:31.601 --> 16:33.335
<i>(Christina) Clemenza, come
over here for a second.</i>

16:33.336 --> 16:34.837
Did I start too thick?

16:34.838 --> 16:36.539
(Clemenza) Nobody else
knows how to roll dough.

16:36.540 --> 16:37.873
The problem is
you're taking too long,

16:37.874 --> 16:39.041
and the dough's drying out.

16:39.042 --> 16:40.176
Crank, crank a little bit.

16:40.177 --> 16:41.911
Let's just try
and get these done.

16:41.912 --> 16:43.546
I think I made these too small.

16:43.547 --> 16:45.181
Now it's getting all long.

16:45.182 --> 16:46.315
All right, [bleep]
Enough already, man.

16:46.316 --> 16:48.517
Someone's getting cranky.

16:48.518 --> 16:51.020
<i>(Announcer) With a slight discord
among the chefs in Hell's Kitchen,</i>

16:51.021 --> 16:52.988
out on the Venice canals...

16:52.989 --> 16:55.357
(Justin) A kayak pulls
up, who can it be?

16:55.358 --> 16:58.427
(Announcer) Barbie and Justin
have found a nice harmony.

16:58.428 --> 17:00.129
(Barbie) These houses
are beautiful.

17:00.130 --> 17:01.464
(Justin) Seeing the canals...

17:01.465 --> 17:02.898
<i>I really felt like
I could relax</i>

17:02.899 --> 17:04.266
and I could enjoy myself
and I had no worries.

17:04.267 --> 17:07.269
A lot better than
making pasta right now.

17:07.270 --> 17:10.138
(Barbie) Yeah, a lot better
than making pasta right now.

17:12.375 --> 17:15.344
<i>(Christina) I don't want
to do this anymore.</i>

17:15.345 --> 17:17.847
<i>(Clemenza) Yeah, I'm
getting giddy and tired</i>

17:17.848 --> 17:19.181
and I've had enough.

17:19.182 --> 17:20.816
Why is this thing never ending?

17:20.817 --> 17:22.751
(Clemenza) Yeah, we could
be pulling an all-nighter.

17:22.752 --> 17:24.720
My thumb hurts,
and my feet hurt,

17:24.721 --> 17:26.589
and my legs hurt,
and my back hurts.

17:26.589 --> 17:27.990
I just want this to end.
It's really annoying.

17:27.991 --> 17:29.792
I'm starting
to get punch drunk.

17:29.793 --> 17:32.161
We're never going
to finish this pasta.

17:32.162 --> 17:33.529
What's going on, guys?
Hey, guys.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.097
Hey.

17:35.098 --> 17:37.633
We kayaked the Venice canals.

17:37.634 --> 17:39.001
Lunch was really sick.

17:39.002 --> 17:41.604
Chef's car is off the hook.

17:41.605 --> 17:43.072
You guys start
anything for dinner?

17:43.073 --> 17:43.906
<i>(Clemenza) Not yet.</i>

17:43.907 --> 17:45.474
<i>(Dana) I'm hungry.</i>

17:45.475 --> 17:47.176
<i>(Justin) All right, we'll
get something going.</i>

17:47.177 --> 17:48.777
So hungry.

17:48.778 --> 17:50.813
There's something in me
that feels really bad for them.

17:50.814 --> 17:52.381
I know how much
it sucks to stay home

17:52.382 --> 17:54.316
to do the punishment.
I knew they were beat down.

17:54.317 --> 17:55.551
I'm literally upstairs cooking
dinner for them right now.

17:55.552 --> 17:56.852
Mmm.

17:56.853 --> 17:58.153
This is really good, Justin.

17:58.154 --> 17:59.221
They're going to love it.

17:59.222 --> 18:02.191
<i>(Dana) Dinner time.</i>

18:02.192 --> 18:04.593
We made dinner.

18:04.594 --> 18:06.161
<i>(Dana) Dude, is that a joke?</i>

18:06.162 --> 18:07.496
I don't want to look at pasta.

18:07.497 --> 18:08.964
Are you guys kidding?

18:08.965 --> 18:10.666
You made pasta?

18:10.667 --> 18:12.201
So not cool.

18:12.202 --> 18:14.570
(Christina) We just rolled
pasta for six hours.

18:14.571 --> 18:15.571
Really, guys?

18:15.572 --> 18:16.805
Are you kidding me?

18:16.806 --> 18:19.208
It was really a nice dinner.
At least appreciate it?

18:21.811 --> 18:23.746
I don't think
you cooked all that.

18:23.747 --> 18:25.414
(Announcer) With all of
the final five chefs

18:25.415 --> 18:27.650
having had their fill
of pasta for the day...

18:27.651 --> 18:29.485
I'm tired.
Gonna shower and hit the bed.

18:29.486 --> 18:33.889
(Announcer)
The chefs turn in early.

18:35.258 --> 18:37.359
(Announcer)
Tonight is Italian night.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.128
And not only do they have
a brand-new menu to prep...

18:39.129 --> 18:40.629
Dana, you busy?

18:40.630 --> 18:42.698
(Announcer) But for the
first time this year,

18:42.699 --> 18:45.234
the entire dining room
will be fed out of one kitchen.

18:45.235 --> 18:47.403
Can you please help me
with some of this chicken?

18:47.404 --> 18:49.004
Dinner service is probably
the most important thing

18:49.005 --> 18:50.406
I've ever done
in my life tonight.

18:50.407 --> 18:52.241
The Italian stallion
Clemenza's coming through, baby.

18:52.242 --> 18:55.177
Stand back, step off,
watch out.

18:55.178 --> 18:58.047
(Dana) Ah, you're pounding
them a little thin.

18:58.048 --> 19:01.016
<i>Clemenza.</i>

19:02.252 --> 19:05.588
This is ridiculous.

19:05.589 --> 19:07.656
Clemenza, what are you doing?

19:07.657 --> 19:11.594
<i>Mr. Italiano takes it
upon himself</i>

19:11.595 --> 19:14.296
<i>to pound the chicken breast
like this big.</i>

19:14.297 --> 19:18.500
Some of these are,
like, absurd.

19:18.501 --> 19:19.969
Did Clemenza pound them all?

19:19.970 --> 19:21.170
Yeah, he started to pound them.

19:21.171 --> 19:22.204
<i>(Scott) Why?</i>

19:22.205 --> 19:23.839
<i>Why would you do this?</i>

19:23.840 --> 19:26.342
Nothing yesterday was
this size at all. I know.

19:26.343 --> 19:27.810
<i>(Scott) Clemenza.</i>

19:27.811 --> 19:28.944
<i>Yes.
Come here. Come here.</i>

19:28.945 --> 19:29.979
<i>Come here!</i>

19:29.980 --> 19:32.247
Why did we did this?

19:32.248 --> 19:33.549
<i>(Scott)
I don't know what to do.</i>

19:33.550 --> 19:35.684
I really don't.
I have no idea.

19:35.685 --> 19:37.252
<i>He [bleep] it all,</i>

19:37.253 --> 19:39.455
<i>so I don't know
what you guys want to do.</i>

19:47.140 --> 19:49.108
<i>(Announcer) It's just moments
before Hell's Kitchen opens</i>

19:49.109 --> 19:50.109
for Italian night.

19:50.110 --> 19:51.143
Clemenza.

19:51.144 --> 19:52.878
(Announcer) Unfortunately,

19:52.879 --> 19:55.581
the resident Italian
may have gone a little too far

19:55.582 --> 19:57.116
preparing
the kitchen's chicken cutlets.

19:57.117 --> 19:58.551
Why did we do this?

19:58.552 --> 20:00.352
<i>I don't know
what to do anymore.</i>

20:00.353 --> 20:02.655
Clemenza screwed up
half the chicken,

20:02.656 --> 20:06.158
so now I don't even have enough
orders of chicken breaded.

20:06.159 --> 20:08.894
Take out the ones that are
ridiculously large, like this.

20:08.895 --> 20:09.929
<i>(Dana) Okay.</i>

20:09.930 --> 20:11.230
This isn't cool.

20:11.231 --> 20:12.331
Not at all.

20:12.332 --> 20:13.632
[Whining]

20:13.633 --> 20:14.900
I love double work.

20:14.901 --> 20:16.535
Yeah, I [bleep] up.

20:16.536 --> 20:18.270
And you know, I'm going
to kick ass in dinner service.

20:18.271 --> 20:20.773
And that's what matters.

20:22.909 --> 20:24.410
Okay.

20:24.411 --> 20:26.178
It's Italian night
in Hell's Kitchen,

20:26.179 --> 20:28.781
and tonight,
there's nowhere to hide.

20:28.782 --> 20:31.317
[Exhaling]

20:31.318 --> 20:33.953
Show me you've got
the heart of a champion.

20:33.954 --> 20:35.321
Let's go, guys.
Yes, chef.

20:35.322 --> 20:36.322
James.

20:36.323 --> 20:37.790
Chef.

20:37.791 --> 20:39.358
Open Hell's Kitchen
for Italian night.

20:39.359 --> 20:40.125
Let's go.
Yes, chef.

20:42.000 --> 20:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:51.504 --> 20:53.639
Flatbread and filet mignon.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.874
(Announcer) Tonight the
Hell's Kitchen menu

20:55.875 --> 20:58.611
will feature crab capellini,
butternut squash risotto,

20:58.612 --> 21:02.147
and filet of beef
with handmade cavatelli pasta.

21:02.148 --> 21:04.316
I'll have the flatbread.
Flatbread.

21:04.317 --> 21:05.684
Uh, chicken parmesan.

21:05.685 --> 21:07.353
Move, Clemenza.
Yes, chef.

21:07.354 --> 21:08.654
If there's ever a night

21:08.655 --> 21:09.822
for you to shine...
Yes, chef.

21:09.823 --> 21:10.956
<i>(Gordon) It's tonight.</i>

21:10.957 --> 21:12.358
Tonight is your night.
Let's go.

21:12.359 --> 21:14.059
Bring it the [bleep] on, baby.
Let's go.

21:14.060 --> 21:15.094
Two 2s, on order.

21:15.095 --> 21:16.161
2 couples, table 21,

21:16.162 --> 21:17.463
two couples, table two.

21:17.464 --> 21:18.897
Two risotto, two flatbreads.
Entree.

21:18.898 --> 21:21.000
One chicken, one salmon,
one filet.

21:21.001 --> 21:22.167
One shrimp tagliatelle.

21:22.168 --> 21:23.836
(All) Yes, chef.

21:23.837 --> 21:25.237
What were the appetizers
for that table, Clemenza?

21:25.238 --> 21:27.906
[Bleep].

21:27.907 --> 21:30.409
Clemenza,
what were the appetizers

21:30.410 --> 21:32.845
<i>on that table?
I didn't hear it, chef.</i>

21:32.846 --> 21:34.813
Dude, pull it together.

21:34.814 --> 21:36.515
Two deuces together, Clemenza.

21:36.516 --> 21:38.283
Yeah,
he's not even concentrating.

21:38.284 --> 21:40.019
Two risotto going
with two flatbread.

21:40.020 --> 21:41.253
That's two 2s together.
Gotcha, gotcha.

21:41.254 --> 21:43.422
Okay.
(Gordon) What's on order?

21:43.423 --> 21:44.857
Two risotto, two flatbreads.
Can I have a "yes, chef"?

21:44.858 --> 21:46.258
Yes, chef!

21:46.259 --> 21:48.427
These things happen.
What are you going to do?

21:49.963 --> 21:51.497
Clemenza, can I help you?

21:51.498 --> 21:52.631
Can you help?
What an understatement.

21:52.632 --> 21:54.133
<i>I think he needs help.</i>

21:54.134 --> 21:55.868
I'm grabbing a cutting board
so I can help you cut.

21:55.869 --> 21:57.703
Clemenza was
completely disorganized.

21:57.704 --> 21:59.738
I'm running out of the kitchen
to get a cutting board.

21:59.739 --> 22:01.774
Come on, get some organization,
Clemenza.

22:01.775 --> 22:03.842
(Clemenza) Yes, chef.
He's [bleep] everywhere.

22:03.843 --> 22:06.011
(Gordon) No system whatsoever.

22:06.012 --> 22:07.980
This is your night
to shine, big boy.

22:07.981 --> 22:09.815
Step up or step off.

22:09.816 --> 22:11.150
Flatbread?
Yes.

22:11.151 --> 22:13.118
Right here, chef.

22:13.119 --> 22:14.920
Two flatbread.

22:16.623 --> 22:18.457
Perfect.

22:18.458 --> 22:20.392
<i>(Gordon) Oh, Clemenza.</i>

22:20.393 --> 22:22.327
How you can work in a mess and
produce a stunning flatbread,

22:22.328 --> 22:24.129
I'll never know.

22:24.130 --> 22:26.165
(Announcer) With Clemenza
delivering half of the first table

22:26.166 --> 22:28.816
of appetizers...
Risotto, please. Let's go.

22:28.817 --> 22:32.971
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay looks to
Barbie to complete the order.

22:35.842 --> 22:37.142
That's delicious.

22:37.143 --> 22:38.077
Everyone like that now.
Let's go.

22:38.078 --> 22:39.178
Yes, chef.

22:39.179 --> 22:40.979
Nailed it.
Yay.

22:40.980 --> 22:42.781
All I want to do
from here on out

22:42.782 --> 22:44.349
is put out perfect risotto.

22:44.350 --> 22:47.352
<i>(Gordon) Keep it going, Barbie.
Yes, chef.</i>

22:47.353 --> 22:48.787
Service, please.

22:48.788 --> 22:50.589
(Announcer)
The first order of appetizers

22:50.590 --> 22:52.891
has made it out to
the dining room right on time.

22:52.892 --> 22:54.960
<i>Fantastic.</i>

22:54.961 --> 22:56.995
Whoa, that's really good.

22:56.996 --> 22:58.530
(Announcer) And chef Ramsay
is looking to the final five

22:58.531 --> 23:00.632
to have a service to remember.

23:00.633 --> 23:02.101
On order, 4 couples, table 23.

23:02.102 --> 23:02.768
Three capellini, one risotto.

23:02.769 --> 23:03.969
<i>Entree...</i>

23:03.970 --> 23:05.471
<i>one shrimp,
one salmon, two filet.</i>

23:05.472 --> 23:06.872
Yes, chef.

23:06.873 --> 23:09.508
Clemenza,
what are those appetizers?

23:09.509 --> 23:11.343
I was talking over you, chef.

23:11.344 --> 23:12.778
Hey, you're not even
interested anymore, are you?

23:12.779 --> 23:14.012
Yes, I am, chef.

23:14.013 --> 23:15.948
Clemenza doesn't listen.

23:15.949 --> 23:18.450
He doesn't [bleep] listen.

23:18.451 --> 23:20.052
<i>(Gordon) Call the [bleep],
take it out yourself.</i>

23:20.053 --> 23:21.153
Yes, chef.

23:21.154 --> 23:23.388
We got three capellini,
one risotto.

23:23.389 --> 23:26.692
One tagliatel,
one salmon, two filet.

23:29.496 --> 23:31.597
Yes, Clemenza.
Yes, thank you.

23:31.598 --> 23:33.232
Hurry up with the risotto.

23:33.233 --> 23:34.700
Yes, chef.

23:36.970 --> 23:39.104
Stop, all of you.
Come here.

23:39.105 --> 23:40.939
Uh-oh.

23:40.940 --> 23:42.274
We produced a stunning risotto.

23:42.275 --> 23:43.976
Taste that.

23:43.977 --> 23:46.345
Literally was raw wine,
no salt,

23:46.346 --> 23:49.047
and the risotto
was hard as a rock.

23:49.048 --> 23:50.949
It's like a white wine risotto.

23:50.950 --> 23:52.017
(Justin) You cook risotto
and you're, like,

23:52.018 --> 23:53.285
"you know how to do it."

23:53.286 --> 23:55.220
There's no excuse for not
being able to cook it correctly.

23:55.221 --> 23:56.321
Look at me.
Hey, you.

23:56.322 --> 23:58.157
You just switched off.

23:58.158 --> 23:59.992
He's in the [bleep],
and now you.

23:59.993 --> 24:01.693
You're now out of control.

24:01.694 --> 24:04.463
We're on dinner service 14!

24:04.464 --> 24:07.533
We should be able
to get risotto right.

24:07.534 --> 24:09.334
<i>(Gordon) How long, Barbie?
Walking up to you now.</i>

24:09.335 --> 24:10.669
Barbie, taste it.

24:10.670 --> 24:13.672
If it tastes good, send it up.

24:13.673 --> 24:16.008
If it tastes like [bleep],
don't!

24:16.009 --> 24:17.810
(Gordon) Get out of the way.
Put it down.

24:17.811 --> 24:19.211
And [bleep] off with you, yeah?

24:22.382 --> 24:23.715
All of you.
Stop!

24:23.716 --> 24:25.083
<i>Come here.
[Bleep]</i>

24:25.084 --> 24:26.952
<i>(Gordon) Taste it.</i>

24:26.953 --> 24:28.020
What does that need?

24:28.021 --> 24:29.988
Salt and cooked longer.

24:29.989 --> 24:31.657
That was disgusting.

24:31.658 --> 24:33.959
I mean, you don't send
a risotto like this

24:33.960 --> 24:35.093
<i>up to the pass.</i>

24:35.094 --> 24:36.695
<i>It's like rice soup.</i>

24:36.696 --> 24:38.497
Well, you're cooking
like idiots.

24:38.498 --> 24:39.798
Get a grip.

24:39.799 --> 24:41.834
Yes, chef.

24:41.835 --> 24:43.268
<i>(Clemenza) Let me help you.</i>

24:43.269 --> 24:44.369
Let me tell you what I need.

24:44.370 --> 24:45.137
Move that out of the way.

24:45.138 --> 24:46.305
Take the risotto.

24:46.306 --> 24:47.506
(Clemenza) I got your risotto.

24:47.507 --> 24:48.740
I'll do whatever it takes.

24:48.741 --> 24:49.775
I'll do backflips
over to the over stations

24:49.776 --> 24:50.909
if I gotta,

24:50.910 --> 24:52.411
but the bottom line
is that food needs to go out.

24:52.412 --> 24:53.846
I need the risotto first.

24:53.847 --> 24:55.480
Clemenza, take the risotto.

24:55.481 --> 24:56.715
(Barbie)
Clemenza, take the risotto.

24:56.716 --> 24:58.250
You need the risotto
to go first.

24:58.251 --> 24:59.351
You're not... you're
still a little bit watery.

24:59.352 --> 25:00.719
Take the risotto!

25:00.720 --> 25:02.387
<i>(Clemenza)
Looks like someone literally</i>

25:02.388 --> 25:04.523
peed in the frying pan
and added butter.

25:04.524 --> 25:06.925
I just [bleep] told you,
take the risotto.

25:06.926 --> 25:08.961
Barbie, you want to do it
and sink yourself,

25:08.962 --> 25:10.329
go right [bleep] ahead.

25:10.330 --> 25:11.897
There's no helping this girl.

25:11.898 --> 25:13.866
Okay.

25:19.038 --> 25:20.038
There we go.

25:20.039 --> 25:21.039
Stop!
Ah, [bleep].

25:21.040 --> 25:22.241
Told you.

25:22.242 --> 25:24.309
All of you,
look at that [bleep].

25:24.310 --> 25:26.912
<i>Hey, now just taste that,
all of you.</i>

25:26.913 --> 25:28.647
Come on, chef.
I know it sucks.

25:28.648 --> 25:30.215
You just tell me it sucks,
I'll understand.

25:30.216 --> 25:33.151
Taste it.

25:33.152 --> 25:35.220
Taste, you.

25:35.221 --> 25:37.689
Tastes like cheese soup.

25:37.690 --> 25:39.091
Look.
Overcooked.

25:39.092 --> 25:40.692
[Bleep].

25:40.693 --> 25:41.960
<i>Look at it.</i>

25:41.961 --> 25:44.997
Look.

25:44.998 --> 25:46.365
It's an insult to Italy.

25:46.366 --> 25:47.599
(Gordon) You ready to go home?

25:53.051 --> 25:55.552
(Announcer) It's 45 minutes
into Italian night,

25:55.553 --> 25:57.621
and Barbie's
poor performance on risotto...

25:57.622 --> 25:59.756
Look at that [bleep].

25:59.757 --> 26:01.925
(Announcer)
Has the kitchen in the toilet.

26:01.926 --> 26:04.561
Look at it.
Look.

26:06.498 --> 26:08.899
It's an insult to Italy.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.634
<i>Now, look at me.
Yes, chef.</i>

26:10.635 --> 26:12.236
I don't care
if I go on now without you.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.871
One more dish like that,
madam...

26:13.872 --> 26:15.772
don't wait
till the end of service.

26:15.773 --> 26:18.675
Do you, me,
and all your team a favor

26:18.676 --> 26:19.843
and get the [bleep]
out of here.

26:19.844 --> 26:21.745
Yes, chef.

26:21.746 --> 26:24.081
I don't want to go home.
I know where the door is,

26:24.082 --> 26:25.949
and I want to be
on this side of it.

26:25.950 --> 26:28.285
Look at me. Serious now.
Yes, chef.

26:28.286 --> 26:31.488
Last [bleep] time.
Yes, chef.

26:31.489 --> 26:32.823
[Bleep].

26:32.824 --> 26:37.127
I have no idea what's going on
with Barbie right now,

26:37.128 --> 26:39.062
but you can just hear
the bombs dropping.

26:39.063 --> 26:41.665
Risotto!
Risotto's coming right now, chef.

26:41.666 --> 26:42.733
[Imitating bomb whistling]

26:46.538 --> 26:49.606
Excellent.

26:49.607 --> 26:52.376
(Announcer) Barbie's fourth attempt
at the butternut squash risotto...

26:52.377 --> 26:54.344
<i>(Gordon) Service, please.</i>

26:54.345 --> 26:56.346
(Announcer) Has finally met
chef Ramsay's standards.

26:56.347 --> 26:57.714
Very good.

26:57.715 --> 26:59.650
Barbie, you're working
one... four flatbread.

26:59.651 --> 27:01.552
<i>Push it out.</i>

27:01.553 --> 27:04.388
(Announcer) The kitchen is steadily
sending food to the dining room.

27:04.389 --> 27:06.757
Two capellini coming in, chef.
Service, please.

27:06.758 --> 27:08.992
(Announcer) With a third of
their appetizers completed...

27:08.993 --> 27:10.727
Away now, first entree.

27:10.728 --> 27:13.197
(Announcer) The final
five move on to entrees.

27:13.198 --> 27:15.899
<i>(Gordon) One orecchiette, two
filet, one chicken parm.</i>

27:15.900 --> 27:18.635
How long?

27:18.636 --> 27:20.637
I need six minutes.
Let's go.

27:20.638 --> 27:24.875
I'm focusing on searing
the 100 orders of filet

27:24.876 --> 27:26.843
that I have coming in.

27:26.844 --> 27:29.313
It's a lot of meat,
so I'm a little concerned.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.914
And by a little, I mean a lot.

27:30.915 --> 27:32.516
Stop.
Stop, you.

27:32.517 --> 27:33.817
Stop.

27:33.818 --> 27:35.686
All of you, come here.
Come here.

27:35.687 --> 27:37.888
Talk to me.
What do you think?

27:37.889 --> 27:39.823
Obviously,
the pan got too hot, chef.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.758
Go on then, chef.
It's burned, chef.

27:41.759 --> 27:44.828
Dana has two filets,
and they are black as night.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.863
<i>(Barbie) Everything in
the pan was black.</i>

27:46.864 --> 27:49.199
Oh, [bleep] off.
The lot of you, will you?

27:49.200 --> 27:50.434
[Bleep].

27:50.435 --> 27:52.135
I should have
just thrown them out.

27:52.136 --> 27:53.837
What's the matter?
I'm fine, chef.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.839
Want to go home?
No, chef!

27:55.840 --> 27:57.574
You're way out of control.
I'm fine, chef.

27:57.575 --> 27:58.609
That's fine, is it?
No.

27:58.610 --> 27:59.910
It's not fine for me.
No, no.

27:59.911 --> 28:00.844
Get a grip, yeah?
Yes, chef.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.479
And get it back.
Yes, chef.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.115
(Announcer) With Dana
slipping on the meat station,

28:05.116 --> 28:06.116
chef Ramsay...

28:06.117 --> 28:07.784
You!
Come here, you.

28:07.785 --> 28:09.886
She can't drive it, can you drive it?
Yes, chef.

28:09.887 --> 28:12.022
(Announcer) Looks to Justin to
take control of the kitchen.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.391
How long for those tables?
Five minutes on that next table...

28:14.392 --> 28:15.826
Thank you.
After this one goes out first.

28:15.827 --> 28:17.394
<i>Thank you, finally.
Oui, chef.</i>

28:17.395 --> 28:19.129
I'm taking the reins.
I'm running this kitchen.

28:19.130 --> 28:20.697
Two filet, two salmon.
You go with the filet first,

28:20.698 --> 28:22.633
I'll follow
with the two salmon, okay?

28:22.634 --> 28:24.434
There's no way chef Ramsay's
shutting us down tonight.

28:24.435 --> 28:26.737
Two filet, walking.
Behind!

28:26.738 --> 28:28.839
<i>(Justin) I told him I'd
get us through this.</i>

28:28.840 --> 28:31.475
I promise you,
I'll get the food to you.

28:32.844 --> 28:34.411
Dana!

28:34.412 --> 28:36.280
Thank you, those filet
were cooked perfectly.

28:36.281 --> 28:37.781
<i>Are we back up now, are we?</i>

28:37.782 --> 28:38.849
We're up, chef.
We're up.

28:38.850 --> 28:40.884
We're going right into
the next pickup.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.786
You good with that or no?
Yeah, the next pickup. Yeah.

28:42.787 --> 28:44.488
(Announcer)
Thanks to Justin's leadership,

28:44.489 --> 28:46.990
ththe first entrees go out
to the dining room.

28:46.991 --> 28:48.458
Really tender.

28:48.459 --> 28:50.427
(Announcer) Back in the
kitchen, Barbie...

28:50.428 --> 28:52.629
I got two capellini going
with two flatbread.

28:52.630 --> 28:54.264
(Announcer) And Clemenza...

28:54.265 --> 28:55.866
Uh, flatbread now...
You got a minute.

28:55.867 --> 28:57.601
(Announcer)
Continue to send appetizers.

28:57.602 --> 28:59.603
Service, please.
Push it!

28:59.604 --> 29:00.604
<i>Let's go!</i>

29:00.605 --> 29:01.905
Two filet, one salmon,

29:01.906 --> 29:03.774
<i>one shrimp.
Let's go.</i>

29:03.775 --> 29:06.276
(Announcer) Now Justin
on fish, Dana on meat,

29:06.277 --> 29:07.978
and Christina on garnish...

29:07.979 --> 29:09.446
Christina, let me know
when you're walking, please.

29:09.447 --> 29:11.048
I got 60 seconds.

29:11.049 --> 29:12.849
(Announcer) Are hoping
to make the second half

29:12.850 --> 29:14.951
of service run more smoothly
than the first.

29:14.952 --> 29:16.586
How long, Dana?
I'm walking.

29:16.587 --> 29:17.921
Right behind.

29:17.922 --> 29:20.490
Talk to me, chef.
Garnish is up for you.

29:20.491 --> 29:23.627
Nah.
[Bleep] No.

29:25.029 --> 29:26.363
All of you, stop.

29:26.364 --> 29:27.698
Uh-oh.

29:27.699 --> 29:31.768
Taste that.
Taste it.

29:31.769 --> 29:33.103
<i>What does that taste like?</i>

29:33.104 --> 29:34.338
<i>Burnt, chef.
Burnt.</i>

29:34.339 --> 29:36.006
<i>And then what about seasoning?</i>

29:36.007 --> 29:36.873
<i>(Christina)
It needs salt, chef.</i>

29:36.874 --> 29:38.408
It needs salt.
Really?

29:38.409 --> 29:40.344
Everyone knows
how much chef Ramsay feels

29:40.345 --> 29:41.812
about seasoning.
You know, there's no excuse.

29:41.813 --> 29:43.680
What's happened to you guys
all of a sudden?

29:43.681 --> 29:45.415
Christina, what's gone wrong?

29:45.416 --> 29:47.918
No...
I don't know, chef.

29:47.919 --> 29:51.588
What I need to do
is regain focus, regain control,

29:51.589 --> 29:53.423
and put up the food
that I stand behind.

29:53.424 --> 29:55.125
Is it coming?
I'm right here, chef.

29:55.126 --> 29:57.561
Are you tasting, are you?
Why are you tasting it?

29:57.562 --> 29:59.563
Because I need to make sure
it's seasoned properly.

29:59.564 --> 30:01.098
Yeah, really?
It's weird, that, no?

30:01.099 --> 30:02.799
For a chef to taste
his own cookin.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.401
Ah.

30:04.402 --> 30:07.037
The difference is night and day.
Yes, chef.

30:07.038 --> 30:09.573
(Announcer) As Christina redeems
herself on the garnish station,

30:09.574 --> 30:11.742
entrees are flying
out of the kitchen.

30:11.743 --> 30:13.577
Service, please.

30:13.578 --> 30:15.345
(Announcer) And diners are thrilled
with what they're receiving.

30:15.346 --> 30:16.947
Delicious.

30:16.948 --> 30:18.982
(Announcer) And with one
table of appetizers left...

30:18.983 --> 30:20.183
All right,
both of you, come here.

30:21.819 --> 30:24.421
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay has a
wager for Barbie and Clemenza.

30:24.422 --> 30:26.590
Do you think you
can get the last table right?

30:26.591 --> 30:27.891
(Both) Yes, chef!
Seriously?

30:27.892 --> 30:28.725
(Both) Yes, chef!

30:28.726 --> 30:31.027
I bet you $100 you don't.

30:31.028 --> 30:32.662
Chef Ramsay, I'm definitely
not taking that bet.

30:32.663 --> 30:33.430
I-I think you're right.

30:33.431 --> 30:34.965
<i>Barbie can't cook.</i>

30:34.966 --> 30:36.666
This is gonna take me
a minute on that risotto.

30:36.667 --> 30:38.869
I'm not ready
on that risotto at all.

30:38.870 --> 30:40.904
<i>Get up there, Clemenza.
(Clemenza) I'm going.</i>

30:40.905 --> 30:42.439
<i>Follow, Barbie. Come on.
Send this up.</i>

30:42.440 --> 30:44.207
Get those apps up.
My entrees are gonna die.

30:44.208 --> 30:46.643
The last table appetizers are
one of the most difficult things

30:46.644 --> 30:48.779
I've ever seen in my life.
I don't understand it.

30:48.780 --> 30:49.846
These people have been
sitting here for this long.

30:49.847 --> 30:51.081
They're starving.

30:51.082 --> 30:52.949
Please, just get it out.

30:52.950 --> 30:55.152
Thank you.

30:58.222 --> 31:00.257
What is that?

31:00.258 --> 31:02.559
What is that?

31:02.560 --> 31:04.094
I don't know.
Look, she's not even answering me.

31:04.095 --> 31:05.061
It's... the crab.

31:05.062 --> 31:07.330
Hey, you.
Come here, you.

31:07.331 --> 31:08.665
<i>This is how bad it is.</i>

31:08.666 --> 31:10.066
One capellini,
one risotto away.

31:10.067 --> 31:12.002
<i>And I got a bowl of capellini,</i>

31:12.003 --> 31:13.937
and there's over
two portions there.

31:13.938 --> 31:15.305
You don't even know
what you're doing anymore.

31:15.306 --> 31:16.873
<i>I've got too much capellini</i>

31:16.874 --> 31:18.742
and not enough crab...
Yes, chef.

31:18.743 --> 31:20.544
You stupid idiot.
Yes, chef.

31:20.545 --> 31:22.412
<i>Have you given up?
Look at me.</i>

31:22.413 --> 31:23.814
I beg you to go home.

31:23.815 --> 31:26.049
<i>I just don't get it!</i>

31:26.050 --> 31:28.752
I just... I honestly
do not understand

31:28.753 --> 31:31.922
what the [bleep] is going on!

31:38.879 --> 31:41.181
(Announcer) An hour and a
half into Italian night,

31:41.182 --> 31:44.918
and every table in the
dining room has been served...

31:44.919 --> 31:46.853
That is good.

31:46.854 --> 31:48.688
(Announcer) Except for one.

31:48.689 --> 31:51.891
Our last table hasn't gotten
their appetizers yet.

31:51.892 --> 31:53.860
Capellini, how long?
Three minutes, chef.

31:53.861 --> 31:55.695
Can you count down?
Yes, chef.

31:55.696 --> 31:57.263
Can you bring your team together?
Yes, chef.

31:57.264 --> 31:59.032
Can you do anything
motivational?

31:59.033 --> 32:00.567
Sorry, guys.

32:00.568 --> 32:02.101
What?

32:02.102 --> 32:04.204
The apps haven't gone out yet?

32:04.205 --> 32:07.874
We actually have to wait
to serve entrees?

32:07.875 --> 32:09.175
Capellini coming, chef.

32:09.176 --> 32:11.244
<i>90 seconds, chef.</i>

32:13.314 --> 32:16.382
<i>Barbie, where are you?</i>

32:18.786 --> 32:20.186
<i>(Gordon) Send those,
uh, capellini.</i>

32:20.187 --> 32:20.987
Service, please.

32:20.988 --> 32:22.689
Are you kidding me?

32:22.690 --> 32:24.390
Five people left,
and this is what we do?

32:24.391 --> 32:25.758
Insane.

32:25.759 --> 32:26.993
It is good.

32:26.994 --> 32:28.595
Can we send
the last table, please?

32:28.596 --> 32:29.829
One chicken parm,
one orecchiette.

32:29.830 --> 32:31.798
Yes, chef!
Yes, chef.

32:31.799 --> 32:33.666
<i>I got your orecchiette coming.
(Gordon) Come on, Christina.</i>

32:33.667 --> 32:36.536
<i>(Justin) Behind.
Garnish!</i>

32:36.537 --> 32:38.738
(Christina) Thank you.

32:38.739 --> 32:40.940
Finally.
Service, please.

32:40.941 --> 32:43.576
The chef apologizes
for the wait.

32:43.577 --> 32:45.478
<i>(Female customer) Wait an
hour for your appetizers,</i>

32:45.479 --> 32:47.947
your entrees come right out!

32:47.948 --> 32:50.283
That is not what I expected.

32:50.284 --> 32:51.951
<i>Switch off.
Clear down.</i>

32:51.952 --> 32:52.952
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

32:55.756 --> 33:00.393
We have been on a amazing,
long journey together.

33:00.394 --> 33:04.030
<i>But I did not
expect this this evening.</i>

33:04.031 --> 33:07.267
You were way, way,
way off the mark tonight.

33:07.268 --> 33:12.038
On the verge of
an embarrassment.

33:12.039 --> 33:15.041
I am just
bitterly disappointed.

33:15.042 --> 33:18.945
Get upstairs...
Analyze everything.

33:18.946 --> 33:21.614
Give me the one person
you want to get rid of.

33:21.615 --> 33:23.049
Leave me alone, guys.

33:23.050 --> 33:24.717
I don't know what to say.
I'm pissed off.

33:24.718 --> 33:26.452
I'm definitely
disappointed in myself.

33:26.453 --> 33:27.553
I expected more.

33:27.554 --> 33:28.788
My pride... my dignity...

33:28.789 --> 33:30.456
like...
In the [bleep] dustpan

33:30.457 --> 33:31.791
with the rest of that risotto.

33:33.761 --> 33:35.662
Hey, you're fine, dude.

33:35.663 --> 33:37.430
This is the first time
you've made a mistake.

33:37.431 --> 33:38.598
Relax.

33:38.599 --> 33:40.066
You've been solid
this whole competition.

33:40.067 --> 33:41.134
Stop.

33:41.135 --> 33:42.902
Christina,
get a hold of yourself.

33:42.903 --> 33:44.437
I know you're not
used to making mistakes,

33:44.438 --> 33:45.872
but come on, girl.

33:45.873 --> 33:47.340
What did you do
that was so bad tonight?

33:47.341 --> 33:49.342
Nothing.

33:49.343 --> 33:51.844
Dude, I gotta say this to you.

33:51.845 --> 33:53.646
If you looked at who was
the worst person in service,

33:53.647 --> 33:54.981
I'm sorry, it's Barbie.

33:54.982 --> 33:56.916
<i>Every one of those risottos,</i>

33:56.917 --> 33:58.551
I had to tell her what to do,

33:58.552 --> 34:00.053
and she still
didn't [bleep] listen.

34:00.054 --> 34:01.521
And that last one,
I even said it.

34:01.522 --> 34:02.922
"It's soupy.
It needs to cook out,

34:02.923 --> 34:04.023
<i>and it needs salt."</i>

34:04.024 --> 34:05.725
Clemenza's got a point.

34:05.726 --> 34:07.593
You get put on a station
like that where you're making

34:07.594 --> 34:08.661
pasta and risotto
and you keep [bleep] it up,

34:08.661 --> 34:09.728
that's real bad,
especially at this point

34:09.730 --> 34:11.164
in the competition.

34:11.165 --> 34:12.965
But I vote for Clemenza
all the time.

34:12.966 --> 34:15.034
I'm so sick
of cleaning up after him.

34:15.034 --> 34:16.703
So it's a difficult decision.

34:16.704 --> 34:18.304
<i>We all knew it
going into service today.</i>

34:18.304 --> 34:19.839
If you [bleep] up today,
you had a good chance

34:19.840 --> 34:21.274
<i>of going home.</i>

34:21.275 --> 34:24.277
Sit on your bed.
Okay.

34:31.185 --> 34:32.985
I just would be happy
to see Barbie go.

34:32.985 --> 34:34.954
I don't particularly like her,

34:34.955 --> 34:37.757
and tonight,
Barbie really sucked.

34:37.757 --> 34:41.226
She didn't have somebody strong
to lean on, and she went down.

34:44.697 --> 34:46.733
I get that.

34:48.335 --> 34:50.570
Barbie, what happened tonight?

34:50.571 --> 34:54.206
You just bombed out?

34:54.208 --> 34:57.110
I had a bad [bleep] night.
I can admit to it.

34:57.110 --> 34:59.979
But Clemenza comes over
to my station,

34:59.980 --> 35:03.049
he's in my way,
bumping around, making a mess.

35:03.050 --> 35:05.651
He's a [bleep] oaf.

35:05.652 --> 35:07.820
I should not have had
that bad of a night.

35:07.821 --> 35:09.155
Not at all.

35:09.156 --> 35:10.656
<i>(Clemenza) Come on, Dana!</i>

35:10.657 --> 35:12.825
<i>(Justin) Come on, let's go.</i>

35:15.095 --> 35:17.363
My vote is for Clemenza.
Okay.

35:17.364 --> 35:18.765
I vote for Barbie.

35:18.766 --> 35:20.099
So you guys
are voting for each other.

35:20.100 --> 35:20.633
You guys need to [bleep] vote.

35:20.634 --> 35:22.101
Plain and simple.

35:22.102 --> 35:25.772
We need to get a handle
on what happened there.

35:25.773 --> 35:27.840
I asked him for help
and his help was not helping me.

35:27.841 --> 35:29.876
Yeah, but I'm sorry.
When I'm... when I'm...

35:29.877 --> 35:31.544
<i>when I'm telling somebody
"don't bring up the risotto,</i>

35:31.545 --> 35:32.445
<i>it's not ready."
I'm getting told,</i>

35:32.446 --> 35:33.379
"bring up the [bleep] risotto"

35:33.380 --> 35:34.280
and I'm getting
screamed in my face.

35:34.281 --> 35:35.581
Your back was towards me.

35:35.582 --> 35:36.949
I wasn't screaming at you
in your face.

35:36.950 --> 35:38.818
Clemenza, take the risotto.

35:38.819 --> 35:39.986
I got your risotto.

35:39.987 --> 35:41.854
Take the risotto!

35:41.855 --> 35:44.924
I just [bleep] told you,
take the risotto!

35:44.925 --> 35:47.827
You said bring the [bleep] thing
up just exactly like that!

35:47.828 --> 35:49.962
I'm not gonna stand there
and [bleep] allow somebody

35:49.963 --> 35:51.164
to speak to me that way.
I'm [bleep] sorry.

35:51.165 --> 35:52.432
Too bad.

35:52.433 --> 35:54.367
I'm definitely
in danger of going home.

35:54.368 --> 35:55.735
Not happy about it,
don't think I deserve it.

35:55.736 --> 35:57.503
It was [bleep] Italian night.

35:57.504 --> 35:59.672
The one [bleep] night
that I wanted to do good.

35:59.673 --> 36:01.641
The one night I really got
a [bleep] chance to shine,

36:01.642 --> 36:04.577
and instead
I got a smack in the face.

36:04.578 --> 36:08.080
I'm... I'm just...

36:08.081 --> 36:10.450
Really?
Like, [bleep] really?

36:10.451 --> 36:11.884
Okay.

36:11.885 --> 36:13.319
Both bombed.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.488
<i>We both bombed.
(Justin) Both bombed.</i>

36:15.489 --> 36:17.523
Everyone seems to think
that Barbie is annoying

36:17.524 --> 36:19.659
or she does stupid things,
but you know what?

36:19.660 --> 36:22.061
That's all petty [bleep].
But she really did bomb tonight.

36:22.062 --> 36:24.096
Clemenza, on the other hand,
is just a disaster.

36:24.097 --> 36:25.932
If you're a mess
and it doesn't bother you,

36:25.933 --> 36:28.501
then, you know, how can
you organize a kitchen of 50?

36:28.502 --> 36:31.537
I mean, you were all both part
of the station that bombed.

36:31.538 --> 36:33.372
<i>This is, like, I...
I don't know</i>

36:33.373 --> 36:35.374
if I'm just, like,
thrown off from tonight,

36:35.375 --> 36:36.609
but I don't know why
I'm having such a hard time,

36:36.610 --> 36:38.044
like, putting
my head around it.

36:38.045 --> 36:39.479
I don't really know.

36:39.480 --> 36:41.481
[Sighs]

36:43.317 --> 36:46.319
[Suspenseful music]

36:46.320 --> 36:47.920
♪

36:52.893 --> 36:55.127
What a night.

36:55.128 --> 36:57.430
It's such a shame.

36:57.431 --> 36:59.499
You're supposed to be
the unique talent.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.933
<i>Right.</i>

37:00.934 --> 37:02.668
I trust you've come
to a consensus.

37:02.669 --> 37:03.936
Chef, I don't think
the team came to

37:03.937 --> 37:05.905
a final nomination, chef.

37:08.809 --> 37:10.443
Does anyone
have a pair of [bleep]

37:10.444 --> 37:11.644
to tell the truth?

37:11.645 --> 37:14.647
I don't know either, chef.

37:24.592 --> 37:27.294
(Announcer) After failing to
truly come together as a team

37:27.295 --> 37:29.997
during dinner service,
the chefs were asked to agree

37:29.998 --> 37:33.066
on the one person who will be
nominated for elimination...

37:33.067 --> 37:35.068
I trust you've come
to a consensus.

37:35.069 --> 37:36.603
(Announcer) And they have
also failed at that.

37:36.604 --> 37:38.105
Chef, I don't think
the team came to

37:38.106 --> 37:41.141
a final nomination.

37:42.377 --> 37:44.011
Does anyone
have a pair of [bleep]

37:44.012 --> 37:46.146
to tell the truth?

37:46.147 --> 37:49.149
I don't know either, chef.

37:51.152 --> 37:52.986
Yeah.
Go on, Dana.

37:52.987 --> 37:56.089
We were deliberating up until
the very last moment.

37:56.090 --> 38:01.395
It's between
Barbie and Clemenza.

38:03.965 --> 38:05.665
I want to hear
from both of them.

38:05.666 --> 38:09.369
Clemenza, Barbie.
Step forward.

38:12.306 --> 38:14.074
<i>Barbie.
Yes, chef.</i>

38:14.075 --> 38:15.475
Why do you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen?

38:15.476 --> 38:16.743
I haven't lost
my passion, chef.

38:16.744 --> 38:18.478
<i>You reminded me
of where the door is,</i>

38:18.479 --> 38:20.213
and I want to stay on
this side of the door, chef.

38:20.214 --> 38:23.316
No callback.
Lacking inspiration.

38:23.317 --> 38:26.319
No leadership qualities.
Completely in the weeds.

38:26.320 --> 38:29.222
Nothing was correct
on your station.

38:29.223 --> 38:31.992
I never gave up, chef.
You did give up.

38:31.993 --> 38:35.695
That was not me at my best,
but I never gave up.

38:36.864 --> 38:38.398
Clemenza.
Yes, chef.

38:38.399 --> 38:41.468
Seventh time

For 50% of your performance
in this competition,

38:45.873 --> 38:48.642
you've been standing there.

38:48.643 --> 38:54.548
Seven [bleep] times
standing in front of me!

38:54.549 --> 38:56.983
Why do you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen?

38:56.984 --> 38:59.052
<i>'Cause I have done some good,
and I have done a lot of good.</i>

38:59.053 --> 39:00.120
<i>Tonight was an embarrassment.</i>

39:00.121 --> 39:01.822
Being the Italian night,
believe you me,

39:01.823 --> 39:04.291
I wanted to shine.
I-I-I wanted to do more.

39:04.292 --> 39:06.393
I-I did not quit once
towards service.

39:06.394 --> 39:08.261
No matter what you said,
no matter what was thrown at me,

39:08.262 --> 39:10.397
I kept going
and going and going.

39:10.398 --> 39:13.366
My question to both of you:
Why was there no synergy?

39:13.367 --> 39:15.502
I find it hard to trust
Clemenza on the line.

39:15.503 --> 39:17.504
He is disorganized.

39:17.505 --> 39:19.439
<i>He puts stuff everywhere!</i>

39:19.440 --> 39:21.441
Oh... [Pops cheek]
Whoop-de-[bleep]-doo.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.845
I told you on every risotto,
it wasn't done right.

39:24.846 --> 39:28.248
<i>Your answer to me
was, "take it up there."</i>

39:28.249 --> 39:30.016
I'm not ready to go home
and I'm not ready to give up.

39:30.017 --> 39:32.252
I'm not gonna give up.

39:32.253 --> 39:34.287
Chef, I've been a team player.
I've battled through everything.

39:34.288 --> 39:35.856
I always give you 100%.

39:35.857 --> 39:39.359
Every time I come down,
I am ready for battle.

39:39.360 --> 39:40.494
[Sighs]

39:40.495 --> 39:41.795
<i>Okay.</i>

39:41.796 --> 39:45.799
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen...

39:50.938 --> 39:54.207
Clemenza.
Sorry, big boy.

39:54.208 --> 39:56.276
Give me your jacket and leave
Hell's Kitchen, please.

39:56.277 --> 39:57.377
Yes, chef.
I appreciate all your effort,

39:57.378 --> 39:58.745
but you're not ready...
It's been a pleasure.

39:58.746 --> 40:00.814
For Vegas.

40:00.815 --> 40:03.817
Love you, Clemenza.
Love you, snack pack.

40:03.818 --> 40:06.052
<i>Barbie, back in line.
Yes, chef.</i>

40:06.053 --> 40:08.021
Later, guys.

40:10.992 --> 40:12.792
<i>Hell's Kitchen,
without a doubt,</i>

40:12.793 --> 40:13.994
is the hardest thing
I ever had to do.

40:13.995 --> 40:16.563
Clemenza!
I'm running out of time!

40:16.564 --> 40:18.498
It's been up and down
and high and low.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.167
<i>You should be able to nail</i>

40:20.168 --> 40:22.035
a New York-style pizza.
This is a joke.

40:22.036 --> 40:23.403
But I fought through it.

40:23.404 --> 40:24.437
Dana, Clemenza,
congratulations.

40:24.438 --> 40:26.173
Yes!
[Screams]

40:26.174 --> 40:28.175
I've been up for elimination
more than anybody.

40:28.176 --> 40:29.509
And then I have to
put up with Clemenza.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.211
Clemenza.
Clemenza, chef.

40:31.212 --> 40:32.913
People thought I was down,
people thought I was out.

40:32.914 --> 40:34.514
I just kept coming
and coming and coming back.

40:34.515 --> 40:36.616
Everybody's trying to
get rid of me,

40:36.617 --> 40:38.552
and I still put out better food
than everybody standing there!

40:38.553 --> 40:40.987
Clemenza, back in line.
[Grunts]

40:40.988 --> 40:43.523
To get kicked out on
Italian night is embarrassing,

40:43.524 --> 40:45.158
<i>but coming to Hell's Kitchen</i>

40:45.159 --> 40:46.826
has definitely
put some spark back into me.

40:46.827 --> 40:48.261
I know I'm going to the top.

40:48.262 --> 40:50.330
Listen carefully.

40:50.331 --> 40:53.667
Each of you has
a one-in-four chance

40:53.668 --> 40:56.836
<i>of winning this competition.</i>

40:56.837 --> 41:00.840
Try and visualize becoming
the head chef in Vegas,

41:00.841 --> 41:04.444
<i>one of the most sought-after
playing fields for any chef</i>

41:04.445 --> 41:06.713
anywhere in the world,

41:06.714 --> 41:09.883
with a salary of $1/4 million.

41:09.884 --> 41:13.186
There is a lot at stake here.

41:13.187 --> 41:16.523
This is where you really
need to push it.

41:16.524 --> 41:17.757
(All) Yes, chef!

41:17.758 --> 41:20.627
Piss off.
Thank you, chef.

41:20.628 --> 41:22.262
There's only three people
I gotta get through

41:22.263 --> 41:23.230
to win this competition.

41:23.231 --> 41:25.699
I've never been this focused.

41:25.700 --> 41:27.701
I really am here for a reason,
and that's because.

41:27.702 --> 41:30.103
I-I've cooked as hard
as I possibly can.

41:32.340 --> 41:33.807
<i>All right, champagne.
Nice.</i>

41:33.808 --> 41:35.408
<i>(Dana) This is real.</i>

41:35.409 --> 41:40.380
There is $1/4 million
within my reach!

41:40.381 --> 41:42.916
Final four, guys!
Final four, guys!

41:42.917 --> 41:44.751
I can smell it!
I can taste it!

41:44.752 --> 41:45.919
And I want it!

41:45.920 --> 41:47.687
Justin, there's a note.
Read it.

41:47.688 --> 41:49.356
"Congratulations on making it
to the final four.

41:49.357 --> 41:51.124
"Enjoy this.
The best part is yet to come.

41:51.125 --> 41:53.693
<i>Chef Ramsay."</i>

41:55.329 --> 41:57.564
All righ...
Oh, [bleep]!

41:57.565 --> 42:00.033
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

42:00.034 --> 42:02.002
(Announcer) Next time...

42:02.003 --> 42:03.136
Oh, my God!

42:03.137 --> 42:04.804
(Announcer) You won't believe

42:04.805 --> 42:07.507
who chef Ramsay
allows into Hell's Kitchen.

42:07.508 --> 42:10.043
It sucks so bad.
Man, this is kinda scary.

42:10.044 --> 42:13.113
(Announcer) And then, in a dinner
service that tests each chef's

42:13.114 --> 42:14.714
leadership qualities...

42:14.715 --> 42:17.317
Each of you will have a turn
running the pass.

42:17.318 --> 42:18.451
(Announcer) Does Dana...

42:18.452 --> 42:19.586
Dana, answer me.

42:19.587 --> 42:21.054
It's gonna be ready
when it's ready.

42:21.055 --> 42:22.122
(Announcer)
Really try to sabotage

42:22.123 --> 42:23.857
the other chefs to get ahead?

42:23.858 --> 42:25.325
Dana's dragging on fish.

42:25.326 --> 42:27.193
I'm waiting
for first [bleep] table.

42:27.194 --> 42:29.062
(Announcer) Does her
closest ally, Christina...

42:29.063 --> 42:30.930
Where's that cod, Dana?
I need it walking!

42:30.931 --> 42:32.932
(Announcer)
Become her new enemy?

42:32.933 --> 42:34.768
I don't give a [bleep] about
friendship, [bleep] you.

42:34.769 --> 42:36.870
<i>Walking with cod.
Walk quickly!</i>

42:36.871 --> 42:38.705
<i>Dana, walking!
(Gordon) Now Dana's [bleep] me.</i>

42:38.706 --> 42:39.739
Wait, what?

42:39.740 --> 42:41.074
Right now, we're [bleep].

42:41.075 --> 42:43.943
(Announcer) It's the moment
they've all been waiting for.

42:43.944 --> 42:46.880
I deserve to be in the finale.
I have to win tonight.

42:46.881 --> 42:49.082
Honestly, I could see
all four of you

42:49.083 --> 42:52.552
in the Hell's Kitchen final...

42:52.553 --> 42:54.754
But there can only be two.

42:54.755 --> 42:56.823

Next time on Hell's Kitchen.</i>
