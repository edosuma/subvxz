19:13.528 --> 19:16.573
Wake up! It's the morning!

19:16.656 --> 19:20.034
Damn it, Todd, the investor
showcase is in half an hour.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.870
- Did you work on the song?
- Huh?

19:21.954 --> 19:24.205
Pull yourself together, man!

19:24.289 --> 19:27.793
Ugh! Why did the water have
to come out of your mouth?

19:27.876 --> 19:31.671
Well, I'm awfully sorry
to have wasted your time.

19:31.755 --> 19:34.257
I don't think our man is going to show.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.425
[door slams open]

19:35.508 --> 19:36.969
<i>Wait!</i>

19:37.051 --> 19:38.637
Good God, what's happened?
[groaning]

19:38.720 --> 19:41.807
He looks like he was up all
night playing some sort of

19:41.808 --> 19:44.893
videographic game. He's in
no condition to debut a song.

19:44.977 --> 19:47.520
Give the kid a chance, Van Cleef.

19:47.604 --> 19:51.024

20:15.548 --> 20:18.051
- Enough!
- Clearly, Van Cleef has shown

20:18.134 --> 20:20.637
a rare lapse in taste and judgment.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.016
I apologize for wasting your
time with this talentless imp.

20:24.098 --> 20:26.810
Hey, Van Cleef, Todd may not be ready

20:26.893 --> 20:29.187
for the high-flying world of rock opera

20:29.270 --> 20:32.148
or the larger world outside
of my living room couch,

20:32.231 --> 20:34.860
but you know what? 
He's a good friend.

20:34.943 --> 20:36.778
I don't see how that's relevant.

20:36.862 --> 20:39.238
No, of course you don't.
Maybe Todd's worse off today,

20:39.322 --> 20:41.951
but you're worse off in
the long run, because you're

20:41.952 --> 20:44.828
gonna die alone and unloved,
you pompous, affected asshole!

20:44.911 --> 20:48.748
[grunts] Mon dieu! 
Never have I ever!

20:48.832 --> 20:51.001
Hey, maybe don't burn the bridge.

20:51.084 --> 20:54.671
- I could still beg for a second chance.
- Shut your mouth, Todd.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.382
And you shut yours, Van Cleef, 
or I will buck it shut.

20:57.465 --> 21:00.385
Suck a dick, dumb shits! 
[blows raspberry]

21:03.346 --> 21:05.557
Oh, that damn video game.

21:05.640 --> 21:09.185
No, it's not the video game's fault.
I blew it.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.479
For a second, I actually convinced myself

21:11.563 --> 21:14.024
I was more than just a worthless screw-up.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.225
Fool me once, fool me twice,

21:16.226 --> 21:18.570
fool me chicken soup with rice.

21:18.653 --> 21:21.489
I guess there's a reason they
don't call it "the rock opera fun."

21:21.573 --> 21:23.867
They call it "the rock opera business."

21:23.950 --> 21:27.203
[sighs] Guess I won't be needing
this piece of junk anymore.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.622
Hey, no. Hold on to that.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.165
Why don't you just put it
in the living room closet?

21:31.249 --> 21:33.543
- Really?
- In fact, from now on,

21:33.626 --> 21:35.503
you can keep all your stuff
in the living room closet.

21:35.587 --> 21:41.342
- Thanks, BoJack, for everything.
- This, I will get rid of.

21:44.429 --> 21:45.805
- What the...
- Don't look at those!

21:45.889 --> 21:47.974
- Those are private!
- Are these the notes

21:48.058 --> 21:51.103
you've been taking on
 Mr. Peanutbutter? It's gibberish!

21:51.185 --> 21:53.730
Have you just been mashing
keys this whole time?

21:53.813 --> 21:55.065
It's a... it's a work in progress.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.191
What's really going on here?

21:57.275 --> 21:59.695
Look, I've been following
you two around for the

21:59.696 --> 22:02.114
last couple weeks, and I
think it's pretty obvious

22:02.196 --> 22:04.616
to everyone that you shouldn't
be with Mr. Peanutbutter.

22:04.699 --> 22:08.120
- You should be with me.
- No, I've dated you.

22:08.202 --> 22:12.082
Sure, you're smart and
sophisticated and cool,

22:12.165 --> 22:13.750
but you're also mean.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.252
What's your article on
Mr. Peanutbutter called?

22:16.335 --> 22:18.588
The working title is,
"Nine Jokes From the '90s

22:18.671 --> 22:19.965
We Haven't Stopped Laughing at."

22:20.048 --> 22:21.674
- I knew it!
- Come on!

22:21.758 --> 22:24.052
Like you're not gonna tear
BoJack apart in your book.

22:24.136 --> 22:26.512
I'm not "tearing him apart."

22:26.596 --> 22:29.808
I'm writing a nuanced
portrait of a complicated man.

22:29.891 --> 22:32.518
Well, then, we might be
doing different things.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.854
Mr. Peanutbutter is nice to me!

22:34.938 --> 22:38.524
He's kind and he's generous 
and he's loyal.

22:38.608 --> 22:41.402
You know what your
problem is? You're trying

22:41.403 --> 22:44.072
to be a Zelda but you're
so obviously a Zoe.

22:44.156 --> 22:46.282
Ugh! Don't label me.
You don't know who I am.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.911
You can live your happy Zelda
life in this happy Zelda town

22:49.995 --> 22:52.205
and pretend you're a happy Zelda,

22:52.288 --> 22:56.375
but I know you, and this isn't you.

22:56.459 --> 22:58.670
<i>People don't change, Diane, not really.</i>

22:58.753 --> 23:00.213
<i>Mr. Peanutbutter's a Zelda.</i>

23:00.296 --> 23:01.840
<i>He's happy and he's carefree</i>

23:01.923 --> 23:05.718
<i>and he's loving, but
you and me, we're Zoes.</i>

23:05.802 --> 23:09.055
Yeah, I bought this earlier,
and I'd like to return it.

23:09.139 --> 23:10.556
I don't know where the receipt went.

23:10.682 --> 23:12.892
I remember you. 
You came in yesterday.

23:12.976 --> 23:15.228
No problem.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.105
<i>[Wayne] We're Zoes, Diane.</i>

23:17.189 --> 23:20.025
<i>We're cynical and we're
sad and we're mean.</i>

23:20.108 --> 23:24.237
Thanks for your help, character
actress Margo Martindale.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.199
I don't feel good about
what we did here, BoJack.

23:27.281 --> 23:31.703
I don't know what you're talking about.
This never happened.

23:31.786 --> 23:34.664
<i>[Wayne] There's a darkness inside you,</i>

23:34.747 --> 23:38.334
and you can bury it deep in
burritos as big as your head,

23:38.417 --> 23:41.171
but someday soon, that
darkness is gonna come out,

23:41.254 --> 23:44.590
and when it does, I want you to call me.

23:46.801 --> 23:49.345
I like that guy.
