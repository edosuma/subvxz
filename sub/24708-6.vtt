13:35.546 --> 13:37.882
Come on out.

13:43.220 --> 13:46.440
I'm detective kirkendall.
Is your baby okay?

13:47.858 --> 13:50.694
Yeah, uh, he's just sleepy.

13:50.694 --> 13:53.364
What's his name?

13:53.364 --> 13:56.867
- he's just a week old.
  She hasn't named him yet.
- no, huh?

13:56.867 --> 14:02.456
She'd like to name him after
Aries, if that punk would do
What he's supposed to do.

14:02.456 --> 14:06.410
Brenda, like i told bernard,
There's a right way to get
The father to do his duty.

14:06.410 --> 14:10.214
All right.
You gonna remember
Those things we said?

14:10.214 --> 14:14.051
- yeah.
- all right.

14:14.552 --> 14:16.887
Have a good day.

14:28.182 --> 14:30.985
A mr. Curry called
From his car.
He said he's parking.

14:32.987 --> 14:35.856
I got the boss.
Yeah.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.362
Detective?

14:42.446 --> 14:47.368
I've got something
For your desk.
Uh-huh.

14:47.368 --> 14:49.837
I noticed you had a frog.

14:52.339 --> 14:55.009
And here's another one.
It's rubber.

14:55.009 --> 14:57.878
[ squeaks ]
Yeah.

14:57.878 --> 15:01.048
Like the human-condom cutoffs
I've got on for underwear.

15:06.270 --> 15:09.189
[ fancy ]
I know. It's a comstat
Meeting, lillian.

15:09.189 --> 15:14.862
I gotta prepare my cases.
No, i can't leave early.

15:14.862 --> 15:19.116
Look, if i don't
Make it on time,
Then forge my signature.

15:19.116 --> 15:22.820
Yeah, all right.
[ handset settles in cradle ]

15:22.820 --> 15:24.455
Parents' night
At jennifer's school.

15:24.955 --> 15:27.658
The teachers lay the work out,
And each parent's
Supposed to sign.

15:27.658 --> 15:31.629
- you got a comstat meeting
  In the morning, huh?
- i told lillian to sign for me.

15:31.629 --> 15:35.799
So, we got this guy coming up
Who hired the d.o.a.'s
Limo last night.

15:35.799 --> 15:39.837
The d.o.a.'s wife says
This guy was a regular
Customer and that he's gay.

15:39.837 --> 15:41.972
Did she think he was
Capable of violence?

15:41.972 --> 15:44.758
Didn't get that hit.
Maybe he had
Some nasty friends.

15:44.758 --> 15:47.478
[ simone ]
That must be him.

15:47.895 --> 15:50.397
I gotta talk to the boss.
All right, i'll talk
To him in the pokey.

15:50.397 --> 15:52.816
Yeah, i'll come in.

15:54.351 --> 15:59.857
I'm being harassed
By this p.a.a. And i gotta
Draw the line on it.

15:59.857 --> 16:02.192
She give me that. It's rubber.
She's a rubber fanatic.

16:02.192 --> 16:06.330
Tells me she's wearing
Condom undergarments
And every other damn thing.

16:06.330 --> 16:09.867
-you tell her you're married?
- don't take a backward step.

16:09.867 --> 16:13.037
Are we talking physical
Advances, andy?

16:13.037 --> 16:16.006
She corners me all the time.

16:16.006 --> 16:18.876
She makes physical adjustments
With my collar and so forth.

16:18.876 --> 16:21.378
Yeah. All right,
I'll talk to her.

16:21.378 --> 16:23.630
Yeah, i feel
You gotta step in.

16:23.630 --> 16:26.684
- all right.
- [ groans ]

16:26.684 --> 16:30.054
Can you be less oblique
About what you need with me?

16:30.554 --> 16:32.523
At the moment
I just need to know your
Whereabouts last night.

16:32.523 --> 16:36.193
Has some crime taken place?
Because i certainly
Wasn't involved.

16:36.193 --> 16:39.196
Are you interested
In cooperating here,
Mr. Curry?

16:39.196 --> 16:42.700
Just answer the questions
That i'm putting to you,
Please.

16:42.700 --> 16:45.869
Detective sipowicz,
Lawrence curry.

16:45.869 --> 16:48.038
How do you do?
Good. Where were
You last night?

16:48.038 --> 16:52.876
Mr. Curry, we know a limousine
Picked you up at your office
Last night at 8:00.

16:52.876 --> 16:57.664
Where'd it take you?
I went to have a few drinks
At a bar before going home.

16:57.664 --> 17:01.385
I'm not supposed
To be drinking.
My wife doesn't know.

17:01.385 --> 17:05.472
- what bar?
- i don't remember
  The name of it.

17:05.472 --> 17:09.259
-how long did you have the limo?
-the driver dropped me
 At my home around midnight.

17:09.259 --> 17:13.262
Now, i want to know
What this is about.
You by yourself in the limo?

17:13.262 --> 17:17.984
- is mike kinnan all right?
- no, mike kinnan is not all
  Right. Mike kinnan is dead.

17:17.984 --> 17:21.905
- oh, no. Oh, my god.
- what do you know about that?

17:21.905 --> 17:23.906
- i don't know
  Anything about it.
- you're a liar.

17:23.906 --> 17:27.277
Mr. Curry, you were
At a gay bar last night.
Isn't that right?

17:28.579 --> 17:31.698
Did you pick anyone up?

17:34.618 --> 17:36.120
You understand
That i'm married?

17:36.120 --> 17:39.373
Cooperate and we will try to
Minimize the embarrassment.

17:41.675 --> 17:44.428
Mike took me to a place
In the village, the frolics.

17:44.428 --> 17:46.764
There's a young man,
Frequents that place, luke.

17:47.264 --> 17:49.933
Walks around in cowboy boots
And this ridiculous hat.

17:49.933 --> 17:52.686
I picked him up
Around 10:00.

17:52.686 --> 17:56.273
We went with a friend
Of his i hadn't met...

17:56.273 --> 17:58.609
To a hotel on west 46th.

17:58.609 --> 18:01.812
- who was the friend?
- billy.

18:01.812 --> 18:05.065
I don't know if either
Of them used real names.

18:05.065 --> 18:08.869
The three of you
Left the hotel
Together afterwards?

18:08.869 --> 18:11.238
You, luke and billy?

18:11.238 --> 18:13.707
Mike took me home,
I tipped him...

18:13.707 --> 18:16.126
And told him he should drive
The boys the rest of the night.

18:16.126 --> 18:21.748
- describe luke and billy.
- my experience,
  These are not violent boys.

18:21.748 --> 18:24.001
Describe them physically,
Mr. Curry.

18:24.501 --> 18:26.837
All right. Okay.

18:26.837 --> 18:29.807
Luke is around 5'6",
Very pale skin,

18:29.807 --> 18:34.895
Brown eyes, black hair,
Medium length,
Delicate body.

18:34.895 --> 18:37.231
Facial hair?
Distinguishing marks,
Tattoos?

18:37.231 --> 18:40.100
He's clean shaven,
No tattoos.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.569
The other one did have a cut,

18:42.569 --> 18:47.107
A scar, uh, along here,
About two inches in length.

18:47.107 --> 18:51.278
- like a surgical scar? Or did
  It look like he was stabbed?
- that's beyond my expertise.

18:51.278 --> 18:54.698
Geez, you were expert enough
To know that these boys
Weren't violent.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.950
I'm doing my best
To help you!

18:56.950 --> 19:00.871
This is the worst
Moment of my life.
Can you understand that?

19:00.871 --> 19:04.758
- what else about the other one?
- whatever you think of me,

19:04.758 --> 19:09.379
I'm able to recognize
A good human just died.

19:09.379 --> 19:13.550
Hey, the boys that you put in
That car with their beautiful
Bodies and ridiculous hat,

19:13.550 --> 19:15.719
Those are thieves,
Mr. Curry.

19:15.719 --> 19:18.939
They are hustlers who will
Hurt whoever they have
To hurt to get over.

19:18.939 --> 19:23.360
You wanna get right with your
Conscience? Concentrate on
Helping us find these assholes!

19:23.360 --> 19:26.480
That's all i wanna
Hear coming from you.

19:32.367 --> 19:35.237
Uh, geri?
Lieutenant.

19:35.237 --> 19:39.992
This is awkward. I need to talk
To you about your relationship
With detective sipowicz.

19:39.992 --> 19:41.910
All right.

19:41.910 --> 19:47.549
How would you describe
Your relationship with him?
Friendly.

19:47.549 --> 19:51.219
Well, detective sipowicz feels
You've been, uh, inappropriate,

19:51.219 --> 19:54.890
Making references
To your undergarments
And so forth.

19:54.890 --> 19:58.310
Have you made those kind
Of references?

19:58.810 --> 20:01.313
I may have mentioned
I was wearing
A rubber undergarment.

20:01.313 --> 20:05.567
Had detective sipowicz
Indicated he was uncomfortable
With that kind of talk?

20:05.567 --> 20:08.654
He said he was married.
I didn't take that as saying
He was uncomfortable.

20:08.654 --> 20:11.406
Well, what did you
Take that as?

20:11.907 --> 20:15.077
I thought he was indicating
He wasn't interested in
A serious type relationship.

20:15.077 --> 20:17.996
More of a fun type.

20:20.499 --> 20:23.502
But you understand now
That he's not interested
In that type of relationship?

20:23.502 --> 20:26.755
Well, i think he
Could've told me that,

20:26.755 --> 20:28.957
But yes, i do.

20:28.957 --> 20:32.711
And i'm a little offended
That he would expose me to
This kind of embarrassment.

20:32.711 --> 20:34.680
Uh-huh.

20:34.680 --> 20:38.517
If you're asking
Do i get the message,
The answer is yes.

20:38.517 --> 20:41.353
All right.

20:44.773 --> 20:49.444
And i'm sorry
People can't get past
Their emotional restraints.

20:49.444 --> 20:53.198
D.o.a.'s last fare gave us some
Guys to look for that worked
Out of a couple of gay bars.

20:53.198 --> 20:55.117
[ fancy ]
You'll go out later on?
[ simone ] yeah.

20:55.450 --> 20:58.787
Jill.
Have you met andy sipowicz,
Bobby simone?

20:58.787 --> 21:01.123
I met bobby.
Hi, andy.

21:01.123 --> 21:03.375
How's it going?
You were at d.o.i., huh?

21:03.375 --> 21:06.044
Yeah, yeah. Boss,
You got a minute for me?

21:06.044 --> 21:07.963
Yeah.

21:07.963 --> 21:10.248
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

21:10.248 --> 21:12.551
No callback
From henry coffield?

21:12.551 --> 21:15.470
- no.
- you wanna start
  Working on this?

21:15.470 --> 21:18.006
Yeah, let me get started.

21:24.062 --> 21:28.066
What a little baby you are.
 What a little tattletale.

21:30.068 --> 21:33.822
That guy i talked to earlier,
Said he was getting threatened?
Yeah. What's it about?

21:33.822 --> 21:36.274
His ex-girlfriend's brother
Was hassling him...

21:36.274 --> 21:38.777
Over not taking responsibility
For the girlfriend's baby.

21:38.777 --> 21:42.280
- i went to talk to the brother,
  Try to cool it out.
- during a meal period?

21:42.280 --> 21:46.001
The ex-girlfriend was there
Along with the week-old baby,
Bawling the whole time.

21:46.001 --> 21:50.205
Lieu, a week old infant cries,
The mother's breasts start
Going like spigots.

21:50.205 --> 21:52.791
This girl just stood there.
So, you think
The baby's not hers?

21:52.791 --> 21:56.795
I'm wondering if i shouldn't
Be looking for reports
Of missing black newborns.

21:56.795 --> 22:00.048
Well, you can do that, jill.
But you need to hear me
On going out by yourself.

22:00.048 --> 22:04.052
It was a soft complaint. I
Didn't want us to have to take a
Case on it and get no clearance.

22:04.052 --> 22:07.472
Understood. On the other hand,
You go out by yourself
During a meal period,

22:07.472 --> 22:10.892
Some kind of beef gets filed,
How do we back up
Your version of the story?

22:10.892 --> 22:13.195
You're right.
Okay.

22:13.195 --> 22:16.648
Reach out
To missing persons.

22:25.123 --> 22:28.126
[ chattering ]
???? [ dance ]

22:39.387 --> 22:42.307
-talk to the bartender?
- yeah.

22:42.307 --> 22:46.228
He's gonna give you
The high sign?
If one of them show up.

22:46.228 --> 22:49.431
These punks got half
A brain between 'em, they'll
Be hitting florida by now.

22:49.931 --> 22:52.734
And if they don't,
They will be here
On the hustle.

22:52.734 --> 22:54.820
How's russell doing
On her undercover?

22:54.820 --> 22:59.574
I guess okay. She don't
Talk to me much about it.

22:59.574 --> 23:01.243
Hi.

23:02.627 --> 23:04.863
Get the hell away from me.

23:07.415 --> 23:09.868
Is that our boy there?

23:09.868 --> 23:12.370
Right there.

23:14.956 --> 23:18.260
That's him.
You see anyone else who looks
Like the other guy?

23:18.260 --> 23:22.130
[ simone ] the guy over there
In the gray suit must've
Been waiting for him.

23:22.631 --> 23:24.132
They're getting ready
To leave, andy.

23:24.633 --> 23:28.353
Kid looks like he's packing
On his left side.
Yeah, i caught that.

23:28.353 --> 23:31.356
Come here. Come here.
Relax! Relax!

23:31.356 --> 23:34.943
- [ simone ]
  Just like that, luke.
- how do you know my name?

23:34.943 --> 23:38.613
He got hit in the head with
A meteor when he was a kid,
Gave him strange mental powers.

23:38.613 --> 23:44.069
Come on. Back off.
Sorry, guys. I only got
One set of cuffs.

23:58.834 --> 24:00.969
- so, what's your real name?
- rick ousley.

24:00.969 --> 24:04.673
This couldn't be any more
Simple, rick. We've got
A murdered limousine driver.

24:04.673 --> 24:08.093
We've got a witness that puts
You and your friend billy
In back of that limousine.

24:08.093 --> 24:10.729
We've got the victim's
Registered .32
In your pocket.

24:10.729 --> 24:15.483
The only way you improve
Your situation is you tell us
Everything went down...

24:15.483 --> 24:19.154
Between you, your partner
And that driver.

24:19.154 --> 24:22.073
- then what happens?
- well, that depends
  On who did what.

24:22.073 --> 24:24.576
Plus mitigating factors
Like remorse.

24:24.576 --> 24:27.329
I didn't shoot that driver.

24:28.914 --> 24:30.949
- billy shot him.
- what's billy's real name?

24:30.949 --> 24:32.784
- bill lynch.
- why'd he shoot the driver?

24:32.784 --> 24:37.505
Didn't want to drive us,
After larry had paid him. Tried
To throw us out of his car.

24:37.505 --> 24:40.709
Was there some kind of
Disagreement there? 'Cause
That could be significant.

24:40.709 --> 24:43.261
There was. There was.
Billy had some speed.

24:43.261 --> 24:45.630
And he was snorting it
In the backseat,

24:45.630 --> 24:47.549
And the driver pulled over and
He said, "get the hell out."

24:47.549 --> 24:51.970
Billy was like, "no way. That
Old guy just paid you $100 to
Take us where we wanted to go."

24:51.970 --> 24:55.640
So, me and billy, we wouldn't
Get out of the car.

24:55.640 --> 24:58.727
Well, finally we did.
I got out first and then billy.

24:58.727 --> 25:00.946
I thought we were
Just gonna talk it out.

25:00.946 --> 25:04.232
Mm-hmm. And then
What happened?

25:04.232 --> 25:08.453
Billy said, "well,
You're not gonna drive us
Like the old guy said.

25:08.954 --> 25:12.791
Then give us that $100 he
Gave you." then the driver
Started name-calling.

25:12.791 --> 25:17.045
And that's when billy
Took out this gun that
He's got and he said,

25:17.045 --> 25:22.083
"okay, how about this?"
That shut that sucker up.
He gave up the $100 that point.

25:22.083 --> 25:24.886
No shooting at that point,
Though?

25:24.886 --> 25:28.223
Absolutely not. And i
Thought it was settled.

25:28.223 --> 25:31.559
But billy must've had
Trouble on his mind, huh?

25:31.559 --> 25:33.428
Billy told the driver
To move away from the car.

25:33.428 --> 25:35.764
So, the driver,
He steps away, but billy--

25:35.764 --> 25:39.150
Billy fires a shot anyway.

25:39.150 --> 25:41.186
Now, i swear, i didn't
Know he was like that.

25:41.403 --> 25:43.738
- he just fires the one shot?
- the driver goes down.
  But the guy,

25:43.738 --> 25:47.025
He starts groping for his ankle
And billy pumped a few
More shots into him.

25:47.025 --> 25:51.780
Reached down, he took the guy's
Gun out of his thing.
He said, "let's go."

25:51.780 --> 25:55.166
I'm totally numb at that point.
How's the driver's gun
Get in your pocket?

25:55.166 --> 25:59.788
Billy said that you need
Something on the street
To handle yourself.

25:59.788 --> 26:03.174
He knows more than i do.
I've only been out there,
Like, a couple of months.

26:03.174 --> 26:05.126
He's been out there,
Like, a couple of years.
So, he gave it to me.

26:05.627 --> 26:08.430
- where's billy now?
- he was headed for jersey.

26:08.430 --> 26:10.765
Eventually he was headed
For florida, but he said
He'd get himself picked up...

26:10.765 --> 26:12.968
At a truck stop
And leave the limo there.

26:12.968 --> 26:15.220
What was he gonna
Go to florida for?

26:15.220 --> 26:19.024
He's positive.
You know, the h.i.v. Bug.

26:19.024 --> 26:21.810
He's got this guy in daytona
He was screwing for his meds.
Some kind of new inhibitors.

26:21.810 --> 26:24.980
- you know that guy's name?
- no, i--

26:24.980 --> 26:28.483
I got the guy's
Phone credit card.

26:28.483 --> 26:32.120
That would be in your wallet.
You guys took that, you put
It in a manila envelope.

26:32.120 --> 26:35.290
- you're gonna have to write
  All this down for us.
- we got in the limo...

26:35.290 --> 26:37.292
And billy was driving and
He's freaking out, right?

26:37.792 --> 26:41.296
He's saying, "we gotta get out
Of new york." i'm like,
I just got to new york.

26:41.296 --> 26:45.467
Plus i didn't shoot anybody,
So i don't gotta run.

26:48.420 --> 26:51.306
So, you want me to stress
How shooting that guy--
That that was all billy, right?

26:51.306 --> 26:53.675
And that i was trying
To settle the argument?

26:53.675 --> 26:57.178
We're desperate to have
You do that.

26:57.178 --> 26:59.814
I'm glad i told you
What happened.

26:59.814 --> 27:02.567
I feel a little bit better.
 I feel less remorse.

27:12.610 --> 27:15.330
That's nice of you.
I'll think about it.

27:15.697 --> 27:19.034
Lieu, morning.
Morning. How'd you do
With missing persons?

27:19.034 --> 27:21.503
One possible.
A black woman checked out...

27:21.503 --> 27:23.288
Of roosevelt hospital
Last week with a newborn.

27:23.288 --> 27:25.423
Her mother reported
 Her missing three days ago,

27:25.423 --> 27:27.842
But now she thinks she might've
Gone to north carolina.

27:27.842 --> 27:30.128
Can't move on that.
I'm gonna put you into
The catching order.

27:30.128 --> 27:34.299
- okay.
- no more social work
  For this guy.

27:35.800 --> 27:38.219
Aries, what's going on?

27:38.720 --> 27:40.722
Bernard rolled up on me
In his raggedy-ass pontiac.

27:41.222 --> 27:44.726
Slammed me up against a
Brick wall wanting to know why
Did i bring the cops into it.

27:44.726 --> 27:48.063
He would've killed me
Right there if i didn't say
I would marry brenda.

27:48.063 --> 27:51.316
When you broke up with brenda,
She didn't say anything
About being pregnant?

27:51.316 --> 27:55.787
You don't seem too impressed
About me getting slapped up.
He choked me by my neck.

27:55.787 --> 27:57.572
I'm gonna look at that.

27:58.039 --> 28:00.542
Far as being pregnant, i ran
Into her two months ago, she
Didn't have two words to say.

28:00.542 --> 28:04.546
How did she look?
Didn't look pregnant. She's so
Damn big though, who's to say.

28:04.546 --> 28:07.248
Are you willing to press charges
Against bernard?

28:07.248 --> 28:11.669
What choice do i got?
I ain't marrying his sister.

28:11.669 --> 28:15.723
- we're gonna pick him up.
- you think they're scamming?

28:15.723 --> 28:19.594
- that baby ain't even hers?
- i'm not sure what's going on.

28:19.594 --> 28:22.480
Make yourself comfortable.
Where did the kid
Come from then?

28:22.480 --> 28:26.985
4:00, henry. That's right.
You don't show up here,
I'm coming to brooklyn.

28:26.985 --> 28:29.988
I'm gonna padlock your apartment
And your ass is gonna be out
On the street.

28:29.988 --> 28:32.157
Hi, bobby.

28:34.275 --> 28:36.528
Unfamiliar face.

28:36.528 --> 28:39.197
There's another one.

28:39.197 --> 28:44.702
Jill, uh, kirkendall.
Came over from
Department of investigations.

28:44.702 --> 28:49.457
What's she like?
I don't know. I haven't gotten
A chance to work with her yet.

28:49.457 --> 28:51.960
So, how's your stuff going
With jimmy liery?

28:52.460 --> 28:53.962
He's expanded
His circle of friends.

28:54.462 --> 28:56.848
I guess hanging around
The airport will
Do that for you.

28:56.848 --> 28:59.184
I don't know
What that means, diane.

28:59.184 --> 29:03.438
He's not just
Hanging out with rusty
Stickup guys anymore.

29:07.692 --> 29:12.697
You gonna tell me any more
Or you just gonna say enough
To make me crazy here?

29:12.697 --> 29:15.867
I don't know how to talk
To you about it, bobby.

29:15.867 --> 29:18.069
It's not a lot of fun for me.
You should tell that
To the boss.

29:18.069 --> 29:21.206
- i'm on the guy for reasons.
- you screw their reasons.

29:21.206 --> 29:24.792
This guy liery's
Not setting up to dynamite
The world trade center, is he?

29:24.792 --> 29:27.662
I'm not sure what
He's setting up to do yet.

29:27.662 --> 29:32.133
I'm not drinking with him
And i'm not sleeping
With him, okay?

29:35.553 --> 29:39.057
Mugging it up a little bit
With him, maybe?
Oh, bobby.

29:39.057 --> 29:42.810
[ fancy ]
Go out with jill.
Pick a guy up.

29:42.810 --> 29:46.431
I gotta go meet liery.
Okay, everyone but diane.

29:46.431 --> 29:48.933
- diane russell.
- jill kirkendall.

29:48.933 --> 29:52.570
I'm sorry, i'm on a case.
Look forward
To working with you.

29:52.570 --> 29:54.906
[ sipowicz ]
All set? I got the keys.

30:14.008 --> 30:16.844
Acts like she'd just as soon
Be changing a tire.

30:18.296 --> 30:20.632
So, how's diane liking
That undercover she's on?

30:20.632 --> 30:23.851
I'm not too sure.
She's not too comfortable
Talking about it.

30:23.851 --> 30:28.056
Yeah, i don't know
How comfortable
I'd be working like that.

30:28.056 --> 30:29.974
Guys putting
Their hands on, so forth.

30:30.475 --> 30:32.977
It's not something you gotta
Worry about, right, greg?

30:36.281 --> 30:39.484
There he is.

30:41.536 --> 30:44.989
[ bernard ]
What you doin'?
I'm trying to put this--

30:44.989 --> 30:47.208
You gotta cover
The baby's head, man.

30:47.208 --> 30:50.461
Oh, i don't--
Well, cover his head
For me.

30:50.461 --> 30:52.046
- don't even think
  About running.
- freeze!

30:52.046 --> 30:55.049
Put your hands flat
Against the car.
Put your hands on the car!

30:55.049 --> 30:57.835
- now, bernard, do it!
-put your hands flat
 On the top!

30:57.835 --> 31:01.556
What are you doing to him?
Why are you all
Landing on me?

31:01.556 --> 31:04.225
Aries said he gonna
Marry her, so there ain't
Even a issue no more.

31:04.225 --> 31:06.844
What somebody says with
Your hands around their throat,
That can't be held to them.

31:06.844 --> 31:09.597
- that punk better not back out.
- shut up.

31:09.597 --> 31:13.985
- brenda,
  We're taking you in also.
- bernard.

31:13.985 --> 31:16.988
You don't wanna know
What i'd do you didn't
Have that badge and gun.

31:16.988 --> 31:20.908
That's gonna remain one of
Those theoretical questions,
Bernard.

31:31.453 --> 31:34.122
Right this way.

31:37.492 --> 31:40.245
I'd like to talk to you,
Detective.
Just hang on a second.

31:43.548 --> 31:46.218
- coffee room?
- yeah. Let me just
  Talk to the boss.

31:46.218 --> 31:48.220
[ kirkendall ]
Okay.
Any problems?

31:48.220 --> 31:51.890
There might be some thinking
That this baby got stolen.

31:51.890 --> 31:54.676
There's a real weird hit
Coming off this girl.

31:54.676 --> 31:58.980
So why is this guy
Who hired the limo
Back here?

31:58.980 --> 32:02.150
He brought a lawyer
For the perp, asked
To talk to you and andy.

32:02.150 --> 32:04.986
Lawyers up the kid
Who does the murder.

32:04.986 --> 32:08.490
You should've heard this
Guy in the interview. He's all
Torn up the d.o.a. Got murdered.

32:08.490 --> 32:10.692
Looks like he got over it.

32:10.692 --> 32:15.080
Don't spend too much time
With this asshole.
I want you in with kirkendall.

32:18.533 --> 32:22.454
- what do you want?
- i engaged a lawyer
  Only on the basis...

32:22.454 --> 32:25.206
Of luke having nothing
To do with this shooting.

32:25.206 --> 32:27.876
He said he made you
Understand this.

32:27.876 --> 32:31.296
You're not as stupid as you'd
Need to be to believe what
You're saying to me right now.

32:31.296 --> 32:34.766
- are you saying you didn't
  Believe luke's story?
- you know i didn't.

32:34.766 --> 32:37.519
That's absolutely not true.
Luke told me...

32:37.519 --> 32:41.056
It was billy
Who pointed the gun
And billy who shot it.

32:41.056 --> 32:43.892
Now, under those circumstances,
I wanted to make sure...

32:43.892 --> 32:47.896
Luke doesn't get used as a patsy
Because he's in custody
And billy got away.

32:47.896 --> 32:51.900
Nah, us evil, lazy cops don't
Need to use luke as a patsy,
Mr. Curry.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.903
See, 'cause billy's banging
A scumbag a lot like you
Down in florida.

32:54.903 --> 32:57.405
We got ways to reach out
For billy.

32:59.908 --> 33:04.245
And you're not here to
Protect luke. You're here
To get off on him.

33:06.047 --> 33:08.583
To sit there all excited
In the visitors' room,

33:09.084 --> 33:11.419
Really coming to understand
Luke's awful life growing up.

33:11.419 --> 33:13.838
No wonder he turned out
To be a murdering whore.

33:13.838 --> 33:17.642
He seems to have captured
Your imagination as well.

33:17.642 --> 33:20.011
Hmm.

33:21.012 --> 33:23.014
Well, there you go,
Mr. Curry.

33:23.014 --> 33:27.485
All that a.c.l.u. Stuff,
That's out the window,
Just you and your dirty soul.

33:27.485 --> 33:31.906
Geri. You call me if this
Degenerate don't leave.

33:39.030 --> 33:42.167
Where's bernard?

33:42.167 --> 33:44.452
Some other detectives
Are talking to him right now.

33:44.452 --> 33:47.839
I'm asking about your baby.
I'd think you'd be
More worried about him.

33:47.839 --> 33:50.675
[ cooing ]

33:50.675 --> 33:53.595
I'm asking where he was born.
What hospital?

33:53.595 --> 33:56.181
Beth israel.
What day?

33:56.181 --> 33:59.267
Last week.
How long was your labor?

34:02.721 --> 34:07.058
Brenda, me and detective simone
Both got kids.

34:07.058 --> 34:09.194
It's written all over your face
This is not your baby.

34:09.194 --> 34:13.114
When can i see bernard?
Tell me about the baby.

34:13.114 --> 34:15.817
That's the only way
We can keep you together.

34:15.817 --> 34:18.485
Me and bernard?
That's right.

34:20.989 --> 34:22.991
Oh.

34:22.991 --> 34:26.460
Bernard thought to do it.

34:26.460 --> 34:30.831
'Cause this way
Aries would marry me
'Cause i liked him.

34:31.331 --> 34:33.385
Tell me his plan.

34:34.886 --> 34:37.889
Um, uh--

34:37.889 --> 34:41.676
Hung around the hospital,
Out the entrance.

34:41.676 --> 34:43.978
And when the girls would
Come out with their babies,

34:43.978 --> 34:48.266
I'd say that they could ride in
Bernard's car for a dollar
To where they lived.

34:48.266 --> 34:51.235
And this girl wanted a ride.

34:51.235 --> 34:54.739
So, bernard lied
In the car.

34:54.739 --> 34:59.911
He said i couldn't have babies
And she could have
$500 for hers.

35:01.830 --> 35:04.165
And then she wanted
To get out of the car.

35:04.165 --> 35:09.087
And then this girl
Started yelling.

35:09.087 --> 35:14.092
So, he got her around the throat
In the alley so she'd be quiet.

35:16.211 --> 35:18.012
And you took her baby.

35:24.352 --> 35:26.221
[ sniffles ]

35:26.221 --> 35:29.224
Where's the woman's body?

35:30.475 --> 35:33.278
[ sniffles ]
She's in the alley.

35:33.278 --> 35:37.115
Bernard was gonna pay her.
He had a money order
To fill out.

35:37.115 --> 35:40.819
You gotta take us to the alley
Before you can see bernard.

35:40.819 --> 35:43.488
Then i can see him?

35:43.488 --> 35:45.373
Absolutely.

35:46.825 --> 35:48.660
Okay. I think i can find it.

35:50.078 --> 35:53.715
[ knocking ]
Excuse me.

35:53.715 --> 35:55.884
Is that henry?
Yeah.

35:55.884 --> 35:58.002
Jill's gonna need you to take
A ride with her and brenda.

35:58.002 --> 35:59.804
Sure.

35:59.804 --> 36:02.173
Nice piece of conversation
There, detective.

36:12.100 --> 36:14.402
Someone using my room?
What do you mean?

36:14.402 --> 36:19.274
I was saying, is someone
Using the coffee room?
Nope.

36:19.274 --> 36:22.777
So, what did those
Brooklyn detectives
Think of those guys?

36:22.777 --> 36:25.580
What did they think about
The shylocks you owed?
Solestri and leone.

36:27.582 --> 36:31.002
They weren't involved
In the homicide.

36:31.002 --> 36:32.837
You sure about that?

36:32.837 --> 36:35.290
Yeah, they're sure and
I'm sure about it, henry,

36:35.290 --> 36:39.344
So shut your mouth
About solestri and leone.

36:39.344 --> 36:42.964
Who are you, the bad guy
Inhogan's heroes?

36:44.265 --> 36:46.551
Who else should we
Be looking at, henry?

36:46.551 --> 36:48.186
You want to give me
My glasses back?

36:48.186 --> 36:50.722
Who else should we be looking
At for killing this girl?

36:50.722 --> 36:54.192
I've told everyone i could think
Of including those shylocks.

36:54.192 --> 36:56.477
You want,
I'll pick some names
Out of the phone book.

36:56.477 --> 36:58.897
No, henry,
What you said first...

36:58.897 --> 37:01.399
Was that you didn't
Know anyone that
Could've been involved.

37:01.399 --> 37:03.902
That was in the hallway
When that girl
Was lying there dead.

37:03.902 --> 37:08.740
Then you give detective savino
About a half dozen names.
People you cop reefer from.

37:08.740 --> 37:11.709
People you cop speed from.
 People from the o.t.b.

37:11.709 --> 37:15.380
You gave him
A half dozen zeros
Is what you did, henry.

37:17.999 --> 37:22.420
So, now
You're humiliating me?
You take my glasses off my face?

37:22.420 --> 37:25.590
What, you want to
Make me feel bad?
I look like a mole.

37:25.590 --> 37:28.309
I know what i look like.
See, what i'm wondering,

37:28.309 --> 37:31.396
A guy who can't keep
An appointment until
He stiffs on a few first,

37:31.396 --> 37:33.181
Maybe he can't come up
With the right suspects...

37:33.181 --> 37:36.601
Until he stiffs out
On a few of them too.

37:36.601 --> 37:39.988
I don't even understand what
You're saying, and i think
You're a total asshole.

37:46.694 --> 37:49.581
I'm done playing with you,

37:49.581 --> 37:51.416
You twitchy little creep.

37:51.416 --> 37:55.420
I've told you everything
I could think of,
You son of a bitch!

37:55.420 --> 37:59.374
Now, give me my glasses!
I will break your glasses
In two, henry!

37:59.874 --> 38:02.126
I will take your shoes
From your feet...

38:02.126 --> 38:04.429
And i will kick you out
Of this building barefoot.

38:04.429 --> 38:08.216
I don't know who
It could've been!
Oh, yes, you do. You do!

38:08.216 --> 38:10.268
You're looking for the guts
To come up with it.

38:10.268 --> 38:14.555
I don't.
I liked her so much.
I respect you.

38:14.555 --> 38:17.191
I will humiliate you, henry.

38:17.191 --> 38:19.694
I will put you out there
Naked in the street.

38:19.694 --> 38:22.814
It must have been some crazy
Off of her living up there.
Who?

38:22.814 --> 38:26.034
She used to live
There before her.
Who did?

38:26.034 --> 38:30.371
My mother. Before sara
Moved in the building,
My mother lived up there.

38:30.371 --> 38:33.041
When she got sick,
I moved her downstairs.

38:33.041 --> 38:35.877
How does that fit in, henry?
I don't know.

38:35.877 --> 38:37.712
I don't know.

38:38.212 --> 38:40.798
If there was, like,
This junk letter
Addressed "super"...

38:40.798 --> 38:42.717
With my mother's
Old apartment number,

38:42.717 --> 38:45.470
Some guy looking for me
Picks that up.

38:45.470 --> 38:49.223
Who would have known you lived
In that building, but not
What apartment you lived in?

38:49.223 --> 38:51.342
How the hell would i know?

38:51.342 --> 38:54.429
Someone i was being
A big shot with!

38:54.429 --> 38:57.649
Someone i told
I was getting that building,
And then maybe i backed out.

38:57.649 --> 38:59.734
On what?
On the deal.

39:03.521 --> 39:08.159
Tell me what happened, henry.
Please give me my glasses.

39:08.159 --> 39:11.446
Come on. Tell me what happened.
Tell me what happened.
You're almost there.

39:11.446 --> 39:13.748
You're almost there.
Tell me.

39:13.748 --> 39:17.752
I was supposed
To front money for coke
Off of selling the building!

39:17.752 --> 39:22.674
And i wanted to be a big shot.
And i'd already borrowed money
Against the building.

39:23.174 --> 39:27.011
I was supposed to be a big shot.
But maybe when i backed out,
That screwed the guy...

39:27.011 --> 39:32.350
And the bastard came after me
How he said he was gonna,
But he had the wrong number...

39:32.350 --> 39:36.137
From the junk mail
And he shot sara
Through the door.

39:41.142 --> 39:43.644
Maybe that's what happened.

40:03.297 --> 40:06.167
Hey, gina.
Hi, james.

40:06.167 --> 40:08.886
What's up?
Do you know why
I'm supposed to see him?

40:09.387 --> 40:12.390
- lieutenant fancy? Uh-uh.
-sergeant lorenzo said
 I was supposed to see him.

40:12.390 --> 40:15.727
Yeah, i don't know.

40:15.727 --> 40:18.179
Well, go ahead in.
He won't bite you.

40:18.679 --> 40:20.681
Might as well see
What it's about.
Yeah.

40:20.681 --> 40:23.935
Hello, lieutenant.
Oh, hi, gina.

40:23.935 --> 40:26.354
Thanks for stopping by.

40:27.855 --> 40:30.358
Sergeant lorenzo
Said i should stop in.

40:30.775 --> 40:34.579
Yeah, i, um, spoke
With sergeant lorenzo
A little while ago...

40:34.579 --> 40:37.281
About your possibly
Working in the squad.

40:37.281 --> 40:39.700
Us and anticrime
Exchanging p.a.a.'s.

40:39.700 --> 40:41.953
What would be your feelings
About that?

40:41.953 --> 40:46.007
Is sergeant lorenzo dissatisfied
With my work performance?
He thinks your work's fine.

40:46.007 --> 40:48.843
He told me a few weeks ago
He thought my performance
Was satisfactory.

40:48.843 --> 40:52.296
This doesn't reflect
Badly on you at all.

40:54.298 --> 40:56.684
Under those circumstances,
Wherever i'd be most useful.

40:56.684 --> 40:59.637
There's a big overlap between
Your responsibilities
In anticrime...

40:59.637 --> 41:02.023
And what you'd be
Doing in the squad.

41:02.023 --> 41:05.943
And i'm a good learner too,
I think. I'd hope
I'd pick things up.

41:05.943 --> 41:08.196
I'm sure you will.
Well, that's great.

41:09.397 --> 41:12.366
Unless you hear differently,
Work your shift tomorrow here.

41:12.366 --> 41:16.204
- all right. Thank you.
- i look forward to
  Working with you.

41:19.407 --> 41:23.077
I'm transferred
Down here, james.
Go on.

41:23.077 --> 41:26.547
Lieutenant fancy said to work
My shift down here tomorrow
Unless i'm told different.

41:26.547 --> 41:28.749
That's great, gina.
 That's terrific.

41:28.749 --> 41:32.086
Guess i'll be working
In the same office with you.

41:32.086 --> 41:35.506
I'm really delighted.
Wonder where geri's going?

41:35.506 --> 41:38.426
I think to anticrime.
Lieutenant fancy said
We're like an even trade.

41:38.426 --> 41:42.180
That's not an even trade.
We ought to have
To buy anticrime's coffee...

41:42.180 --> 41:44.432
And fill their fridge for,
Like, three and half years.
Good night.

41:44.432 --> 41:47.235
Good night, lieutenant.
Good night, boss.

41:47.235 --> 41:49.770
- i shouldn't stand here talking
  To you. I'll see you tomorrow.
- yeah, you bet.

41:49.770 --> 41:52.190
I'll see you
Behind that desk.

41:52.190 --> 41:54.358
Geri.
What is it?

41:54.358 --> 41:56.911
Good night.
Good night.

41:56.911 --> 42:01.616
Geri, i've thought
About this more...

42:01.616 --> 42:06.621
And i'm not satisfied you
Can successfully work in
Proximity to detective sipowicz.

42:06.621 --> 42:10.508
I'm certainly capable of it.
I've spoken with sergeant
Lorenzo in anticrime...

42:10.508 --> 42:13.427
And arranged for you
To work up there.
That's an extra flight.

42:13.427 --> 42:16.214
I'd prefer to do this in-house,
But if you'd like, we can
Approach this officially.

42:16.214 --> 42:19.800
Meaning what?
Meaning i could write up
Your behavior...

42:19.800 --> 42:22.553
And we can see
Where that comes out.

42:24.355 --> 42:26.357
I'm really having a lot
Of difficulty believing...

42:26.357 --> 42:28.359
Adults can't deal
With something like this.

42:28.359 --> 42:32.780
- are you willing to accept
  The transfer?
- yes.

42:32.780 --> 42:35.950
Okay. That'll be effective
Tomorrow morning.

42:35.950 --> 42:38.786
Good night.
Good night, lieutenant.

42:46.711 --> 42:49.630
You can come out now.
Your boss has done
Your dirty work for you.

42:49.630 --> 42:52.300
Are you leaving here?

42:52.300 --> 42:56.254
I'm transferred upstairs,
Effective tomorrow morning.

42:56.254 --> 42:58.089
Good.

43:00.808 --> 43:04.178
- hey, andy.
- hi. Simone's got your guy
  In interview 2.

43:04.178 --> 43:07.231
Come on.

43:11.519 --> 43:13.821
I'm from social services.
 I'm here for the baby.

43:15.022 --> 43:18.326
I'm detective kirkendall.
This is the child.

43:18.326 --> 43:20.995
[ baby cries ]

43:23.114 --> 43:25.416
[ medavoy ]
Come on.

43:28.703 --> 43:30.838
Got him?
Yeah.

43:34.258 --> 43:36.127
Good-bye, sweetheart.

43:45.052 --> 43:48.522
Just give us a second,
Henry, huh?

43:49.023 --> 43:53.027
Bobby, i appreciate
The consideration,
Letting me take it on paper.

43:53.311 --> 43:55.780
The guy you're looking
At is jimmy cortez
For throwing the shots.

43:55.780 --> 43:58.899
That's the name
He'll come back to.

43:58.899 --> 44:02.403
You should, uh, hold onto
These until he signs.

44:02.403 --> 44:05.072
They won't send me
To jail, will they?

44:05.573 --> 44:08.075
You just answer detective
Savino's questions, henry.
I was trying to.

44:08.075 --> 44:12.079
I wasn't... Letting
Myself remember.

44:12.079 --> 44:14.081
All right.

44:16.083 --> 44:18.085
I can still live there?

44:18.085 --> 44:20.004
Yeah. I'll talk to you, henry.

44:26.394 --> 44:29.063
So, you're batting
A thousand today, huh?

44:29.563 --> 44:30.931
I heard you did a good
Interview yourself.

44:30.931 --> 44:33.234
But i stopped batting
A thousand a long time ago.

44:33.234 --> 44:36.020
I'm so glad being
Back in a squad.

44:36.020 --> 44:38.322
- it's a good one to be in.
- yeah.

44:38.322 --> 44:40.658
- good night, andy.
- good night.

44:40.658 --> 44:43.744
Night. Guess you held
Up your end today.

44:43.744 --> 44:46.197
Yeah, i got lucky.

44:46.197 --> 44:49.834
We generally clear
At least one homicide
A detective per shift.

44:49.834 --> 44:54.205
- don't be lousing
  Up our percentage.
- i'll try not to, andy.

44:54.205 --> 44:55.840
All right.

45:01.462 --> 45:04.265
It's sick,
Liking it so much.

45:09.937 --> 45:12.189
Night.
