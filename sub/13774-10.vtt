WEBVTT

00:01.652 --> 00:04.359
All right, I'm thinking we need
to up the ante a little bit, all right?

00:04.479 --> 00:05.922
I think we need a new trophy.

00:05.989 --> 00:07.278
We can't have a new trophy.

00:07.398 --> 00:09.829
I'm upset about wuat Andre did
to the Shiva, too, but until

00:09.949 --> 00:11.668
someone else wins its...
Not the Shiva.

00:11.904 --> 00:14.906
I'm talking about a last place trophy.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.674
Huh?
Think about it, all right?

00:16.742 --> 00:17.808
I'm a mortal lock for the Shiva.

00:17.876 --> 00:20.478
And you guys need some scraps to
kind of tussle and fight over.

00:20.545 --> 00:23.347
Pete, do you have anything to
fill your sad existence of a

00:23.415 --> 00:25.216
life besides fantasy football?

00:25.284 --> 00:26.517
Absolutely not, no.

00:26.585 --> 00:28.152
Do you guys?
I mean, kids.

00:28.220 --> 00:29.086
Kids, I guess.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.922
But it sucks, mostly.
They suck.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.824
Now we have the opportunity
to commemorate someone's

00:33.892 --> 00:36.928
terribleness with an
actual physical object.

00:36.995 --> 00:37.895
Yes, perfect!

00:37.963 --> 00:40.865
It should be wrong to have this thing.
Uh-huh.

00:40.933 --> 00:43.334
I mean literally like showing up on an
airplane with a tuna fish sandwich.

00:43.402 --> 00:44.669
I like this idea.
Right?

00:44.736 --> 00:45.603
I really do.

00:45.671 --> 00:48.239
And we need, like, an ace name.
This has to be epic.

00:48.307 --> 00:50.908
You are North Winnetka High.

00:50.976 --> 00:51.509
Oh, God.

00:51.576 --> 00:53.244
You guys ready for the
reunion this weekend?

00:53.312 --> 00:54.879
No. No.
You guys are going, right?

00:54.947 --> 00:56.681
No. Absolutely not
going to the reunion.

00:56.748 --> 00:57.548
Why would I want to go?

00:57.616 --> 00:59.350
The reunion is the worst
thing in the world.

00:59.418 --> 01:01.552
I see all the people from high
school that I want to see, and I

01:01.620 --> 01:02.787
don't even enjoy that.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.890
So I take it none of you have been
working on your reunion book submission.

01:05.958 --> 01:07.291
What? No.
Are you out of your mind?

01:07.359 --> 01:09.794
Can I read you what I have so far?
Please.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.562
Please.
Please.

01:11.630 --> 01:14.632
Webster's Dictionary defines success...
Wow, that is awful.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.901
Right away.
So don't open with that?

01:16.969 --> 01:18.536
No, don't even put that in it.

01:18.603 --> 01:19.704
You're right, you're right.

01:19.771 --> 01:22.106
You know what, I'm going to start off
with a little bit more excitement.

01:22.174 --> 01:22.740
How about this?

01:22.808 --> 01:24.976
At a recent dinner with Bryant
Gumbel, Bryant was heard

01:25.043 --> 01:28.813
remarking, "Andre Nosik...
That's a guy I'd like to know."

01:28.880 --> 01:30.915
No, no, no, no.
Use Greg Gumbel.

01:30.983 --> 01:33.451
You don't want to ostracize
on Gumbel versus the other.

01:33.518 --> 01:35.419
Why don't I just put "a Gumbel"?

01:35.487 --> 01:36.787
Perfect.
That's the one.

01:36.855 --> 01:38.322
That's the one.
Yes?

01:38.390 --> 01:39.600
I'm opening with that.

01:39.720 --> 01:44.157
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:44.629 --> 01:46.731
Rodney Ruxin.

01:46.798 --> 01:48.933
Hey.

01:49.001 --> 01:51.102
I didn't know this was a unisex salon.

01:51.169 --> 01:52.937
Frank "The Body" Gibiatti.

01:53.005 --> 01:54.071
That's right, "The Body."

01:54.139 --> 01:54.939
It's been a while.

01:55.007 --> 01:57.274
Yeah.
You look, uh, the exact same.

01:57.342 --> 01:59.788
You're married and you
still go out a lot?

01:59.908 --> 02:01.345
Yeah, what's up?

02:01.465 --> 02:04.157
- Miss Kiev, 2004.
- Oh really?

02:04.201 --> 02:07.232
- You still hang out with Mitch and Stoney?
- Hell, yeah, man.

02:07.352 --> 02:08.285
What about Berkman?

02:08.353 --> 02:09.453
Berkman passed away.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.021
Really?
Yeah.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.123
I'm sorry to hear that.

02:12.190 --> 02:13.991
DUI.
He died of a DUI?

02:14.059 --> 02:16.193
He died of alcohol poisoning
while he was driving.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.128
Really?

02:17.195 --> 02:19.930
So are you and the Village
People going to the reunion?

02:19.998 --> 02:22.833
And by Village People, I mean
your close core group of friends.

02:22.901 --> 02:24.535
Oh, right.
'Cause you're all gay.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.837
No, I'm not going to the reunion.
Oh, my God.

02:26.905 --> 02:28.439
You're missing out.
Are you going?

02:28.507 --> 02:29.206
Hell, yeah, man.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.909
I've been seeing a trainer for, like,
six months, getting ready for it.

02:31.977 --> 02:32.743
I'm so excited.

02:32.811 --> 02:35.746
Going to relive the brief moment where
you had any importance on this Earth?

02:35.814 --> 02:36.814
Yeah, brief moment.

02:36.882 --> 02:37.948
Try four years, homes.

02:38.016 --> 02:42.620
You know, this guy in high
school, he loved bigger girls.

02:42.687 --> 02:44.255
I don't know what he's talking about.

02:44.322 --> 02:45.890
I didn't...
I remember your prom date.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.459
She looked like Brian Dennehy,
but with long, red hair.

02:48.527 --> 02:50.428
You know what we used to call
this guy in high school?

02:50.495 --> 02:52.296
We used to call him the Herdsman.

02:52.364 --> 02:56.133
'Cause the girls were so big, they
actually resembled actual cattle.

02:56.201 --> 02:59.170
He'd run around and
go, "Hut, hut, heh."

02:59.237 --> 03:02.073
So let me guess... You, uh, work
in the Mercantile Exchange?

03:02.140 --> 03:03.140
Wow?

03:03.208 --> 03:05.009
Trading coffee beans?
Had stock much?

03:05.077 --> 03:05.843
No.

03:05.911 --> 03:07.645
Actually trading pork futures.

03:07.712 --> 03:09.580
We just traded one of
your exes I think.

03:09.648 --> 03:10.948
Huge commission.

03:11.016 --> 03:15.152
"Hut, hut, hut, heh, heh?"

03:15.220 --> 03:17.588
Hurts, man.

03:20.258 --> 03:22.860
♪ You are my buddy... ♪

03:22.928 --> 03:23.761
Oh, yeah.

03:23.829 --> 03:27.331
♪ You are my buddy... ♪

03:28.433 --> 03:30.868
Yeah, yeah.

03:30.936 --> 03:32.136
Hold up.

03:32.204 --> 03:33.671
Oh no.

03:33.738 --> 03:35.573
Oh, yeah.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.409
Ow!

03:38.477 --> 03:40.945
Why didn't you just move
out of the way, Taco?

03:41.012 --> 03:42.313
Why? I couldn't stop.

03:42.380 --> 03:43.581
I was at the vinegar strokes.

03:43.648 --> 03:45.282
What are vinegar strokes?

03:45.350 --> 03:48.018
It's the point during the
sexual experience when a man is

03:48.086 --> 03:50.955
about to orgasm, and he makes a
face like someone put a spoonful

03:51.022 --> 03:52.423
of vinegar up to his nose.

03:52.491 --> 03:53.524
Oh.

03:53.592 --> 03:55.292
Yeah, well, that's horrible.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.761
I never heard vinegar strokes
before, but there is that

03:57.829 --> 04:00.498
moment where you're just like,
"I don't care what happens right

04:00.565 --> 04:01.832
now, I'm finishing."

04:01.900 --> 04:03.501
A bee could be stinging
you on your eyeball.

04:03.568 --> 04:05.136
Gotta go, gotta go.
Gotta finish.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.103
There's a tipping point.

04:06.171 --> 04:08.105
Have you guys ever seen each
other's vinegar strokes?

04:08.173 --> 04:08.839
No.

04:08.907 --> 04:10.875
No. No man should
ever see that, no.

04:10.942 --> 04:13.844
Well, rumor has it, if you
look into a man's eyes during

04:13.912 --> 04:16.547
his vinegar strokes, you
can peer into his soul.

04:16.615 --> 04:18.048
Thank you, Dances With Taco.

04:18.149 --> 04:20.228
Hey, guys, I'm going
to the reunion.

04:20.348 --> 04:22.100
I'm taking my super hot wife,

04:22.220 --> 04:24.698
and I got a name for
that stupid last place trophy.

04:24.949 --> 04:26.004
Frank Gibiatti.

04:26.124 --> 04:27.825
The Body.
Love The Body.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.560
I ran into that guy at a barber shop.

04:29.628 --> 04:31.028
I miss him.
I like that guy.

04:31.096 --> 04:33.030
I don't miss that guy.
That guy is the worst.

04:33.098 --> 04:34.565
He makes me appreciate you guys.

04:34.633 --> 04:36.033
That's how awful a guy he is.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.235
Thank you.
And he called me the Herdsman.

04:38.303 --> 04:39.904
Oh!
Herdsman!

04:39.971 --> 04:42.573
We haven't called you
that in a while. Heh!

04:42.641 --> 04:44.208
It was never even my nickname.

04:44.276 --> 04:46.343
Ruxin, if we lined up every
girl you had sex with in high

04:46.411 --> 04:49.246
school, weld could run for 1,000
yards behind them in the NFL.

04:49.314 --> 04:50.848
At least I got laid in high school.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.717
Yeah, you got laid, because
you are a rabid hyena on the

04:53.785 --> 04:57.021
mountaintop, just digging up
every scrap you could find.

04:57.088 --> 04:57.922
People got to eat.

04:57.989 --> 05:00.658
Well, yes, that was the motto
of most of the girls you dated.

05:00.725 --> 05:02.693
I just maybe wasn't as
shallow as you guys.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.995
I accept your nomination
for Frank "The Body."

05:05.063 --> 05:07.064
Then name for the last place
trophy is not going to be

05:07.132 --> 05:09.166
decided until we get to the reunion.

05:09.234 --> 05:11.969
We all go to the reunion, we
find the worst person possible...

05:12.037 --> 05:13.237
That's the name of our trophy.

05:13.305 --> 05:15.005
In.
Come on, Kevin, you in?

05:15.073 --> 05:16.140
Yeah, I guess I'll go.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.041
You're coming?

05:17.108 --> 05:18.842
Yeah, I want to check out that book.

05:18.910 --> 05:21.412
Plus, I could round up some
more chicks for the Herdsman.

05:21.479 --> 05:23.180
Hut, hut!
Heyah!

05:23.248 --> 05:25.583
Heh, heh!

05:27.538 --> 05:30.154
While I'm here, I got to say,
when my high school reunion

05:30.222 --> 05:32.656
comes around, I'm really hoping
to have something to crow about.

05:32.724 --> 05:35.993
Hoping to finish my
masterpiece by then.

05:36.061 --> 05:37.728
The Vinegar Strokes Symphony.

05:37.796 --> 05:43.601
All right, so your masterpiece
is a symphony about

05:43.668 --> 05:45.703
the face people make
when they ejaculate?

05:45.770 --> 05:48.239
I must educate the world
on this subject.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.406
I don't think they need it.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.507
I need to show you something.

05:50.575 --> 05:51.709
It's very important.

05:51.776 --> 05:53.611
Okay, well, my time is limited.

05:53.678 --> 05:56.780
I'm going to a quinoa potluck and...
All right.

05:56.848 --> 05:59.049
All right, this is
just a rough sketch.

05:59.117 --> 05:59.950
Look what I've been doing.

06:00.018 --> 06:01.418
Oh, is this porn?

06:01.486 --> 06:04.088
No, no, that's me
and my friend.

06:04.155 --> 06:07.558
Filming myself having sex,
trying to look into my eyes,

06:07.626 --> 06:11.028
but it's a lot of pressure.

06:11.096 --> 06:11.962
Oh, yeah!

06:12.030 --> 06:13.664
That's my kitchen counter!

06:13.732 --> 06:14.832
Yeah, yeah.

06:14.952 --> 06:17.034
Oh, no, no.

06:17.102 --> 06:19.403
No, no, no, no, no.

06:21.640 --> 06:22.706
You like this pen?

06:22.774 --> 06:24.041
No. Ugh!

06:24.109 --> 06:25.909
My pen?!

06:25.977 --> 06:27.011
Yeah, yeah.

06:27.078 --> 06:29.246
I can't believe you did
all of that on my desk.

06:29.314 --> 06:30.514
I'm as upset as you are.

06:30.582 --> 06:32.783
I realize you can't capture
your own vinegar strokes.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.119
That's why I need to
watch you having sex.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.394
No, you're not gonna watch me have sex.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:37.514 --> 06:38.581
When is your friend coming over?

06:38.701 --> 06:39.866
I'll be in the corner,
she won't see me.

06:39.986 --> 06:41.125
I'll just watch you.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.927
First of all, I'm not dating anyone
right now, and secondly, no.

06:43.995 --> 06:46.215
Hello.
Dr. Nosik?

06:46.335 --> 06:49.171
You got the wrong
number, asshole.

06:52.872 --> 06:54.485
This reunion is gonna be great.

06:54.605 --> 06:56.728
Can't wait to see who
everyone's become.

06:56.745 --> 06:57.779
I mean, we've grown so much.

06:57.847 --> 06:59.614
I can tell you exactly
who they've become.

06:59.682 --> 07:03.918
They have become the candidates for
the name of our last place trophy.

07:03.986 --> 07:07.289
This is an embarrassment of riches
here, so I have created brackets.

07:07.356 --> 07:08.323
Oh, good idea.

07:08.391 --> 07:10.025
Line 'em up, see who wins.

07:10.092 --> 07:11.192
I still think the "Dray's"

07:11.260 --> 07:12.360
going to be my number one seed.

07:12.428 --> 07:13.361
Yeah, that's the top there.

07:13.429 --> 07:14.462
Why do we have to ridicule?

07:14.530 --> 07:16.965
Can't we just embrace
the amazing night?

07:17.033 --> 07:19.034
That is how we
embrace... ridicule.

07:19.101 --> 07:21.436
Yeah, and shame.

07:21.504 --> 07:23.204
Hey, Andre. How are you?

07:23.272 --> 07:24.873
Oh, Tracy, right?

07:24.940 --> 07:25.774
Oh, my God.

07:25.841 --> 07:27.442
Yeah, Tracy.
Wow, you look great.

07:27.510 --> 07:28.209
Thank you very much.

07:28.277 --> 07:29.044
You look fantastic.

07:29.111 --> 07:31.012
I'm so sorry to hear
about what happened.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.347
It's really horrible.

07:32.415 --> 07:33.348
I'm really sorry.

07:33.416 --> 07:35.050
But other than that,
you look amazing.

07:35.117 --> 07:36.151
Well, yeah, you do, too.

07:36.218 --> 07:37.819
I'll see you inside, all right?

07:37.887 --> 07:39.521
Yeah.
Okay, cool.

07:39.588 --> 07:40.355
Bye.

07:40.423 --> 07:42.023
What was that?
What was that?

07:42.091 --> 07:43.692
"Other than that,
you look amazing"?

07:43.759 --> 07:45.393
What does that mean?
What was she talking about?

07:45.461 --> 07:46.294
That was odd, wasn't it?

07:46.362 --> 07:48.063
Maybe she's talking
about the vest.

07:48.130 --> 07:48.897
The vest works.

07:48.964 --> 07:50.565
Have you seen Mark
Harmon on NCIS lately?

07:50.633 --> 07:52.233
It works.
Oh, okay, here it is.

07:52.301 --> 07:53.902
All right, there I am.
Okay.

07:53.969 --> 07:55.904
Oh, no, hey, this is fine.
Yeah, Andre Nozick.

07:55.971 --> 07:56.905
Look at that, right? See??

07:56.972 --> 07:57.839
Yeah, looks great.

07:57.907 --> 07:59.507
Still had fashion sense back then.

07:59.575 --> 08:00.375
My quote's in here.

08:00.443 --> 08:03.211
Wait... no.

08:03.279 --> 08:05.013
What?

08:05.081 --> 08:08.083
"I was sack-tapped so hard
that my left testicle was

08:08.150 --> 08:09.484
damaged... had to be removed"?

08:09.552 --> 08:10.552
I'm so sorry.

08:10.619 --> 08:11.965
I didn't know that happened.

08:11.986 --> 08:14.154
In fact they had a nudicle
inserted in its place

08:14.274 --> 08:15.641
like nothing ever happened.

08:15.761 --> 08:17.886
- What's a nudicle?
- Oh, it's a fake testicle.

08:18.006 --> 08:19.903
That you put in dogs!

08:20.267 --> 08:22.627
- Well sometimes. - I guess.
- Did you do this?

08:22.747 --> 08:25.090
Andre, I promise, in the history of our
relationship,

08:25.210 --> 08:27.884
- this is the first time I am not lying
to you. -Did you do this?

08:28.275 --> 08:29.560
- Yes, yes, I did.
- Why?

08:29.680 --> 08:31.466
Why would you do this to me?

08:31.586 --> 08:33.967
- I'm just gonna tell people it's a lie.
- You can't do that.

08:34.087 --> 08:36.317
Because they don't know
what's real and what's fake then.

08:36.437 --> 08:38.525
- Well, that's a problem.
- See, the ball part is fake.

08:38.645 --> 08:40.240
What about the doctor part?
Is that fake?

08:40.360 --> 08:42.390
- I think it's confusing.
- Ok, you know what?

08:42.510 --> 08:45.643
You know what? It's fine, it's fine.
You are not going to wreck my reunion.

08:45.763 --> 08:48.736
I'm gonna have a great time and
let everyone know that Andre Nozick is here

08:48.856 --> 08:51.056
and that he's got two balls
and they work great.

08:51.176 --> 08:53.000
Wow, what a turnout.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.811
This is fantastic.
So everyone have a great time.

08:55.931 --> 08:57.745
We got food, we got drinks...

08:57.865 --> 08:59.634
Be sure to catch up with old
friends, and in a few hours,

08:59.702 --> 09:02.404
we're going to follow that old
North Winnetka High tradition,

09:02.471 --> 09:06.474
and we're going to rub Toro's horns
for good luck in the coming year.

09:09.678 --> 09:11.279
Mmm, I feel uncomfortable.

09:11.347 --> 09:12.714
I feel like I'm overdressed.

09:12.782 --> 09:13.715
No, baby.

09:13.783 --> 09:15.717
You look amazing, for real.

09:15.785 --> 09:16.918
Thank you, baby.

09:16.986 --> 09:19.287
The rest of these people can suck it.

09:19.355 --> 09:21.756
Oh, look, it's Quinceañera
Barbie and Bar Mitzvah Ken.

09:21.824 --> 09:22.791
Hi, guys.

09:22.858 --> 09:24.058
Hey, fellas.

09:24.126 --> 09:25.927
Look like you're, uh,
going to the opera.

09:25.995 --> 09:27.729
Oh, you guys look like
you work at Fuddruckers.

09:27.797 --> 09:29.931
Hey, uh, how's Andre
enjoying the reunion?

09:29.999 --> 09:31.499
He's having a ball.

09:31.567 --> 09:32.634
Yes, having a ball.

09:32.701 --> 09:34.335
Just one.
Glad to hear.

09:34.403 --> 09:35.303
I'm going to get a drink.

09:35.371 --> 09:36.137
Do you want something?

09:36.205 --> 09:37.972
Yeah, would you get me
a vodka soda, babe?

09:38.007 --> 09:39.607
Yes.
Thank you.

09:39.675 --> 09:41.276
Hey.
Yes?

09:41.343 --> 09:43.411
Come here.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.987
What's up with the, uh, PDA?

09:48.055 --> 09:49.322
Yeah, it's gross.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.691
My wife is super hot, okay?

09:51.758 --> 09:52.925
I have no problem with that.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.094
I don't think anyone else
should have a problem with that.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.430
It's one of the reasons I
married her... So that I could

09:57.497 --> 10:00.233
take her back to a reunion, be
like, "Look at what I've done."

10:00.300 --> 10:01.267
Wow.

10:01.335 --> 10:04.503
Well, welcome to the
happiest night of your life.

10:04.571 --> 10:05.905
Hey!

10:05.973 --> 10:07.039
Hey.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.574
How are you, Ruxin?

10:08.642 --> 10:10.376
Oh, wow, this is awkward.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.844
Hands off, you two.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.079
The exes!

10:13.146 --> 10:14.213
Oh, come on.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.749
Hey, uh, you look...
you look different.

10:16.817 --> 10:17.950
Oh, yeah, thanks.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.285
I lost 30 pounds.

10:19.353 --> 10:20.419
You lost weight?

10:20.487 --> 10:21.954
Wow, cool, cool, cool.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.457
We don't want to get in the
way of you guys catching up.

10:24.524 --> 10:28.628
Yeah, we got to go... We got to round
up some names for the... Okay, guys.

10:28.695 --> 10:29.795
Hyah!

10:29.863 --> 10:30.730
Good to see you guys.

10:30.797 --> 10:31.931
So, how have you been?

10:31.999 --> 10:33.032
I'm really good.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.100
Things are really good.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.402
Wow. I hear you're a
big-shot lawyer now.

10:36.470 --> 10:37.603
Yeah, everything's good.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.438
I'm, uh... I got married.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.140
Oh, the old ball and chain.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.408
Where is she?

10:42.476 --> 10:44.944
Oh, she's, uh...
she's actually right there.

10:45.012 --> 10:45.945
Really?

10:46.013 --> 10:47.446
Yeah.

10:47.514 --> 10:48.447
Wow.

10:48.515 --> 10:49.448
I don't see it.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.417
What do you mean, you don't see it?

10:51.485 --> 10:53.386
I didn't think she was
really your type.

10:53.453 --> 10:54.420
I don't have a type.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.421
No, you had a type.

10:55.489 --> 10:56.422
No, I don't have a type.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.424
And you can't just...
you don't just change your type.

10:58.492 --> 10:59.625
Ah! Hi.

10:59.693 --> 11:02.128
This is my wife, Irina.

11:02.195 --> 11:05.364
You might recognize her from the
Ukrainian version of The

11:05.432 --> 11:07.433
Bachelorette, so... yeah.

11:07.501 --> 11:08.701
How much was your postage?

11:08.769 --> 11:09.936
She didn't cost anything.

11:10.056 --> 11:11.207
She totally came on her own.

11:11.327 --> 11:13.792
- Oh, congratulations.
- Oh, this must be Mrs. Ruxin.

11:13.912 --> 11:16.356
Or should I say Mrs. Hyah! Hyah!

11:16.476 --> 11:17.576
No.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.278
We went to high school together.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.613
I don't know about that.

11:20.681 --> 11:21.914
Wow.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.382
Uh, good talking to you, Ruxin.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.383
Good to see you, Kathy.

11:24.451 --> 11:25.418
Bye. Kathy.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.153
So, where is that wife of yours?

11:27.220 --> 11:29.388
Hold on, I bet I can hear her coming.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.424
Oh, sound like buffalo.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.425
Yeah.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.559
Tatanka, tatanka.

11:33.627 --> 11:35.227
There we go.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.929
Here's my wife.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.764
This is my wife.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.132
This is Frank.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.736
Frank was best known for peeing in
the water fountains in high school.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.304
Nice to meet you.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.472
This is my wife, Sofia.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.573
Isn't she beautiful?

11:47.641 --> 11:49.408
She's fine.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.643
She's beautiful, isn't she?

11:50.711 --> 11:51.677
She's nice.

11:51.745 --> 11:52.611
Mmm.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.647
Okay, good to see you, man.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.082
Good to see you, too, man.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.853
Weird.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.355
Mmm, I like you.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.456
Yeah, I like you, too.

12:03.523 --> 12:06.125
Hey, let's go kiss in front
of some other people, okay?

12:06.193 --> 12:07.159
Half of it's true.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.094
Half of it's false.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.463
So you're not a doctor, but
you lost your testicle?

12:10.530 --> 12:13.766
No, no, no, I...
am a doctor, and I have testicles.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.067
It's true or it's false.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.402
It's half.

12:16.470 --> 12:17.770
Just show me your balls.

12:17.838 --> 12:18.771
Why?

12:18.839 --> 12:20.773
Let's just clear
all this shit up.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.608
I'm not going to
show you my balls.

12:22.676 --> 12:23.442
Andre, right?

12:23.510 --> 12:24.276
Yeah.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.978
Super successful plastic
surgeon with one ball?

12:26.046 --> 12:26.946
No... yes and no.

12:27.014 --> 12:27.780
Plastic surgeon?

12:27.848 --> 12:28.814
Yes, thank you.

12:28.882 --> 12:29.815
With one testicle.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.117
No, not that.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.918
So you're not a
plastic surgeon?

12:32.986 --> 12:35.654
Fine, I'm a plastic surgeon
with one testicle.

12:35.722 --> 12:36.655
Okay, great.

12:36.723 --> 12:37.490
Look, I got a problem.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.492
Right over there... See that
blonde number, black dress?

12:39.559 --> 12:41.173
I tell everyone she's an eight.

12:41.293 --> 12:43.570
In reality, could be more like a seven.

12:43.690 --> 12:45.777
After tonight, it may be a six.

12:45.897 --> 12:47.590
I had it pay for immigration lawyer,

12:47.710 --> 12:50.602
vaccination and transport for a six.

12:50.722 --> 12:51.947
Be good, Rich.

12:53.054 --> 12:54.829
Rich? I never knew his name.

12:54.949 --> 12:57.385
I know. All I was hearing
was Dr. Moonpie.

12:57.505 --> 12:58.559
Doctor Moonpie.

12:58.679 --> 13:00.623
** Hitler has literally not aged.

13:00.743 --> 13:02.370
- I haven't seen him.
- Oh, he's right over there.

13:03.142 --> 13:04.706
***

13:07.608 --> 13:09.186
Is Seabiscuit Asian?

13:09.508 --> 13:11.016
Seabiscuit's Asian?

13:11.477 --> 13:13.838
- Was he always?
- Can you turn Asian?

13:13.958 --> 13:16.257
Blood wrestle?
That's good, that's catchy.

13:16.258 --> 13:18.619
- They're good, but they're not great.
- Pee-pad.

13:19.219 --> 13:20.672
Pee-pad?

13:20.792 --> 13:23.354
- ***, ***.
- Who?

13:23.474 --> 13:24.846
The box of frogs!

13:25.131 --> 13:27.904
Look. Oh, God, that's Box of Frogs.

13:27.942 --> 13:29.883
- He's still got the face of frogs.
- So horrific.

13:30.003 --> 13:31.977
Look at his face.
Open the box.

13:32.793 --> 13:34.260
Ooh... Box of Frogs.

13:34.328 --> 13:35.595
Oh, my God.

13:35.663 --> 13:37.931
And by the way, I still have a
major bone to pick with him.

13:37.998 --> 13:39.098
Why?

13:39.166 --> 13:40.255
Do you remember Jerry's
party senior year?

13:40.375 --> 13:44.604
He breaks into my mom's car, has sex,
leaves the condom on the steering wheel.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.392
My mom finds it,
blames it on me.

13:46.495 --> 13:47.528
Grounded for two weeks.

13:47.596 --> 13:48.896
Lose car privileges for a month.

13:48.964 --> 13:49.764
Shit.

13:49.831 --> 13:52.166
And the worst thing is,
I challenge him on it.

13:52.234 --> 13:53.367
He never admits it.

13:53.435 --> 13:55.269
What a dick.
What a dick move.

13:55.337 --> 13:56.237
Asshole frog.

13:56.305 --> 13:57.371
Number one contender.

13:57.439 --> 13:58.506
Number one contender.

13:58.573 --> 13:59.607
I have two balls.

13:59.675 --> 14:01.242
I have two balls.

14:01.310 --> 14:02.343
I do.

14:02.411 --> 14:04.238
Sure, you do.

14:05.347 --> 14:06.547
Oh, my God.

14:06.615 --> 14:08.416
Wow, uh, Sheva.

14:08.483 --> 14:09.517
Hi, Andre.

14:09.584 --> 14:12.453
You know, you're the only one here
that can actually help me out.

14:12.521 --> 14:13.554
You know I have two balls.

14:13.622 --> 14:14.789
Just get the word out.

14:14.856 --> 14:15.923
Why would I do that?

14:15.991 --> 14:18.626
I'm telling everyone that I did
the reconstructive surgery.

14:18.694 --> 14:19.727
I have three new clients.

14:19.795 --> 14:21.362
Well, I'm glad I could help.

14:21.430 --> 14:22.363
We're even now.

14:22.431 --> 14:23.364
Are we even?

14:23.432 --> 14:24.198
Oh, oh, yeah.

14:24.266 --> 14:26.534
This... this makes us even.

14:26.601 --> 14:28.035
Hey, guys.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.607
Taco, why are you here?

14:30.727 --> 14:34.162
I am struggling with this
"Vinegar Strokes" symphony.

14:34.282 --> 14:36.418
I've just hit a wall with this thing.

14:36.538 --> 14:38.528
I figured... High school reunion...

14:38.808 --> 14:40.679
The best place for inspiration.

14:40.799 --> 14:43.494
- Really? - High school reunions
are like office parties.

14:43.614 --> 14:44.653
Except the next day

14:44.773 --> 14:46.515
you don't have to see
the other person at work.

14:46.836 --> 14:49.281
Trust me. Mistakes will be made tonight.

14:49.401 --> 14:50.552
People will be sexing.

14:50.845 --> 14:52.004
And when they do...

14:52.270 --> 14:54.058
I'll be there to capture it.

14:55.407 --> 14:56.507
Can I get a Bud Light, please?

14:56.627 --> 14:57.842
Ooh, Petey.

14:57.910 --> 14:58.776
Hey, Stu, what's going...?

14:58.844 --> 14:59.611
Oh!

14:59.678 --> 15:00.445
How you doing, man?

15:00.512 --> 15:01.412
All right, we're hugging.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.213
Good.

15:02.281 --> 15:03.047
Good to see you, man.

15:03.115 --> 15:04.275
How's it going?

15:04.395 --> 15:06.016
Uh, life's good, you know.

15:06.136 --> 15:08.815
I got a shitty-ass job that I hate.

15:08.816 --> 15:10.583
You're good like that.
You're honest.

15:10.651 --> 15:12.252
What's going on with you, bud?

15:12.319 --> 15:14.387
I have a Web site that
distributes independent music.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.723
Cool, still doing the
music, man... I like that.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.758
We just had to fire someone.

15:18.826 --> 15:20.598
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:21.381 --> 15:23.430
You...
you could take her spot.

15:23.497 --> 15:25.532
You could...
you could fill her spot.

15:25.599 --> 15:26.533
Me?

15:26.600 --> 15:27.534
It's creative... yeah.

15:27.601 --> 15:29.335
You always had such a
good eye for talent.

15:29.403 --> 15:30.437
That's what this job is.

15:30.504 --> 15:33.907
You would be traveling around
the country picking up small

15:33.974 --> 15:36.643
bands and...
and getting them on with us.

15:36.710 --> 15:37.744
Like, this is... it's perfect.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.212
This would be great, man.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.080
Six figures.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.115
I think this is perfect for you, man.

15:42.183 --> 15:43.516
Six figures?

15:43.584 --> 15:44.551
Yeah.

15:44.618 --> 15:47.887
♪ Look at how hot
My wife is. ♪

15:49.156 --> 15:50.223
Having a lot of fun, baby.

15:50.291 --> 15:52.125
Yeah, this is, like, the
best night of my life.

15:52.193 --> 15:52.959
Really?

15:53.027 --> 15:53.893
Yeah.

15:53.961 --> 15:55.228
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.

15:55.296 --> 15:56.196
Yeah.

15:56.263 --> 16:00.233
I actually have, like, a
little confession to make.

16:00.301 --> 16:04.971
It was always a fantasy of mine to have
sex with a pretty girl in high school.

16:05.039 --> 16:06.739
Okay.
Really?

16:06.807 --> 16:07.907
Yeah.

16:07.975 --> 16:09.375
Are you sure?
Oh, I'm sure.

16:09.443 --> 16:10.610
Okay.
All right.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.978
All right.
Let's do this.

16:12.046 --> 16:13.546
I got an idea, let's go backstage.

16:13.614 --> 16:15.248
Ooh, yeah.

16:15.316 --> 16:16.216
Whoo!

16:16.283 --> 16:18.318
This is gonna be crazy.

16:22.892 --> 16:24.557
Oh.

16:24.677 --> 16:26.630
Just give me one second, okay?

16:28.530 --> 16:30.164
I gotta *** Gibiatti.

16:34.495 --> 16:36.669
Herdsman no more.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.140
Box of Frogs just offered me a job.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.574
Dude, that's great.
Really?

16:41.642 --> 16:42.809
Yeah.
A good job?

16:42.877 --> 16:44.844
Yeah, like, a thousand times
better than the job I have now.

16:44.912 --> 16:46.246
Congratulations.
What'd you say?

16:46.313 --> 16:48.414
I said, "I will think about it."
Smart.

16:48.482 --> 16:49.916
Went outside...
Mm-hmm.

16:49.984 --> 16:51.417
...gathered my thoughts...
Smart.

16:51.485 --> 16:53.920
...then I gathered up a huge
rock, I smashed his car window,

16:53.988 --> 16:56.089
and I left a used condom on
his steering wheel. Bam!

16:56.157 --> 16:57.023
No, see, not smart.

16:57.091 --> 16:59.425
No, that's not a bam.
That's a bam.

16:59.493 --> 17:02.595
The bigger question is: Where
did you get the used condom?

17:02.663 --> 17:03.363
I made it.

17:03.430 --> 17:05.298
Oh, my...
You ever done that before?

17:05.366 --> 17:06.332
This is embarrassing.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.835
Weird, not terrible, actually.
Horrible.

17:08.903 --> 17:12.305
And I left him a note that
said, "Thank you for the job

17:12.373 --> 17:14.440
offer, but you can
shove it up your ass."

17:14.508 --> 17:15.040
Oh.

17:15.108 --> 17:17.042
"And thank you for the
trophy, Box of Frogs."

17:17.111 --> 17:19.045
Why would you do that?
You hate your job.

17:19.113 --> 17:21.347
'Cause no one has sex in my
mother's car and leaves a used

17:21.415 --> 17:23.798
condom in there without getting some sort of...
Yeah, no, you're right.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.652
You should just...
That's-that's perfect.

17:25.719 --> 17:26.386
Let's just drop it.

17:26.453 --> 17:28.721
He didn't... You didn't tell them?
No!

17:28.789 --> 17:30.323
Why wouldn't you just tell them?

17:30.391 --> 17:30.924
Tell them what?

17:30.991 --> 17:31.658
Tell them nothing.

17:31.725 --> 17:34.861
Okay, Stu didn't have sex in
your mom's car, Kevin did.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.196
What?!
Oh, yeah.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.764
I'm sorry, how do you know this?

17:37.831 --> 17:38.765
'Cause it was with me.

17:38.832 --> 17:40.066
Oh, no.

17:40.134 --> 17:40.900
Oh.

17:40.968 --> 17:41.935
What? What?

17:42.002 --> 17:44.103
Uh, why don't they put these
things in the reunion books?

17:44.171 --> 17:47.207
Kevin lost his virginity
to me in your mom's car.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.275
I'm sorry, can I get
some more details?

17:49.343 --> 17:50.376
No, no. Good.

17:50.444 --> 17:53.846
Okay, he was so excited that
when he came, he kicked through

17:53.914 --> 17:59.752
the window and then he yelled my name...
Shiva Komedi Somakanakram!

18:01.121 --> 18:02.355
It was funny actually.

18:02.423 --> 18:07.527
So the first Shiva blast
was your vinegar strokes.

18:07.595 --> 18:08.962
I...
Whoa.

18:09.029 --> 18:11.231
All right, Eskimo brother.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.098
Sorry.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.566
You son of a bitch.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.803
I just lost a huge job
opportunity because of you. Stu!

18:16.870 --> 18:17.737
I'm gonna handle him.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.572
Okay.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.540
Stu!

18:20.608 --> 18:22.141
Oh, shit, sorry.
Don't go to your car.

18:22.209 --> 18:23.443
Hey, asshole.

18:23.510 --> 18:24.877
Shit!

18:24.945 --> 18:25.645
I have your note.

18:25.713 --> 18:26.412
Shit!

18:26.480 --> 18:27.547
There you go.

18:27.615 --> 18:29.282
Might have my blood
and your semen on it.

18:29.350 --> 18:30.783
I also have your condom in here.

18:30.851 --> 18:33.014
I would take it out
but I don't wanna touch it again.

18:33.226 --> 18:34.406
Alright, in my opinion...

18:34.526 --> 18:36.056
Way to tie off the condom, too...

18:36.176 --> 18:38.543
I have cum, I have your cum
all over my car.

18:38.663 --> 18:40.565
Um, can we talk about that job?

18:40.685 --> 18:42.671
You aren't just a giant cock.
You're an idiot.

18:42.791 --> 18:44.529
Hey, guys, guys...

18:44.920 --> 18:46.947
We can't find the bull.
Little help?

18:47.067 --> 18:48.334
This is amazing.

18:51.905 --> 18:52.772
I'm getting close.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.574
Whoo!
Oh, God!

18:54.642 --> 18:55.908
Oh, God!
Mas!

18:55.976 --> 18:57.143
Mas?
Mas!

18:57.211 --> 18:58.411
Quiero mas?
Mas!

18:58.479 --> 19:00.446
Si?

19:00.514 --> 19:01.347
Okay, okay.

19:01.415 --> 19:02.582
I'm percolating.

19:02.650 --> 19:04.150
What? What?!

19:04.218 --> 19:05.451
Get out of here!

19:05.519 --> 19:06.753
Get out of here, my insides!

19:06.820 --> 19:08.187
Ay! Ay!
Oh, God!

19:08.255 --> 19:08.955
Oh!

19:09.023 --> 19:10.023
Oh, God, I'm getting close.

19:10.090 --> 19:11.524
Oh, I'm at full brew.

19:11.592 --> 19:12.325
Oh, God!

19:12.393 --> 19:13.326
What?!

19:14.728 --> 19:16.262
Okay, keep on it.

19:16.330 --> 19:17.163
I can't stop.

19:17.231 --> 19:18.331
Oh, God, I can't stop.

19:18.399 --> 19:19.532
I can't stop.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.334
Ooh! Ooh!
Ay!

19:21.402 --> 19:22.635
Oh, the coffee's finished!

19:22.703 --> 19:23.803
The coffee's done!

19:29.877 --> 19:31.544
Hyah!
Herdsman for life.

19:31.612 --> 19:32.312
Whoo!

19:32.379 --> 19:36.316
Gentlemen, I present to you...
The Sacko.

19:36.417 --> 19:37.950
Oh, I like it.
Beautiful.

19:38.018 --> 19:39.686
I like it a lot.
"You are the worst."

19:39.753 --> 19:41.688
Nice.
What's that thing on top?

19:41.755 --> 19:44.123
This is the Sacko Del Toro.

19:44.191 --> 19:46.192
Otherwise known as
a bull scrotum.

19:46.260 --> 19:48.161
Wait, so we're naming
it after a bull?

19:48.228 --> 19:49.062
No, no, no, no.

19:49.129 --> 19:51.961
We said we were gonna name it
after the worst people at the reunion,

19:52.081 --> 19:54.534
and I did: you guys.

19:54.601 --> 19:57.403
You're literally the worst
people I've ever known.

19:57.471 --> 19:58.137
Thank you.

19:58.205 --> 20:00.073
Oh, you're just saying that.
You're all sacks of shit.

20:00.140 --> 20:02.075
All right.
Here's to The Sacko.

20:02.142 --> 20:03.509
To The Sacko.
The Sacko.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.078
I love it.
I hope I never win it.

20:05.145 --> 20:06.412
Smells like a new car.
