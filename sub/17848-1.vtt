03:12.401 --> 03:14.152
Esther. Jane-Marie.

03:14.153 --> 03:17.739
Up and dressed.
Come on out now, ladies.

03:17.740 --> 03:20.742
- Train ain't due for a damn week.
- Where's Esther?

03:20.743 --> 03:23.854
She's busy. She's got an all-nighter.

03:33.964 --> 03:37.492
Myrtle.

04:35.818 --> 04:38.861
All right, fall in.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.823
Dress up, Madigan. Dress up.

04:41.824 --> 04:45.143
Murphy, dress 'em up. Come along.

04:52.543 --> 04:56.655
- How long you gonna be?
- 20 minutes, half an hour.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.183
Howdy do, ma'am?

05:09.184 --> 05:13.255
You could have a lot of fun
out of me, darlin', if you tried.

05:13.564 --> 05:17.968
One thing about me, darlin',
I won't go to hell for not tryin'.

05:29.121 --> 05:31.706
Message from Fort Humboldt
for the governor.

05:31.707 --> 05:34.250
I'll take it.

05:34.251 --> 05:38.196
It's an army transport train.
No civilians on board.

05:43.260 --> 05:47.789
Well, this is an odd place to settle.

05:48.265 --> 05:50.558
OK, you heard him,
gentlemen. Line it up.

05:50.559 --> 05:54.479
- Major Claremont.
- Sergeant, get me Captain Oakland.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.675
Fall out the troops for exercise,
but keep them out of those tents.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.762
Yes, sir.

06:02.905 --> 06:05.531
Now you listen to me.

06:05.532 --> 06:09.118
You will remain hard by this train.

06:09.119 --> 06:13.982
You ever see an Indian washing?
They're dirty, and they're ignorant.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.904
Major Claremont.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.930
- How long will this take?
- As long as necessary, Governor.

06:28.931 --> 06:32.141
This train runs on steam.
That requires water.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.644
Let's get it done as
quickly as possible.

06:34.645 --> 06:37.088
Of course.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.899
All right, fall in.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.178
There will be no skylarking...

06:45.239 --> 06:46.989
Bellew said you want to see me.

06:46.990 --> 06:50.685
Get your cipher book.
See what you can make of this.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.622
- It's for the governor.
- It's from the fort.

06:54.623 --> 06:59.210
Maybe it'll tell us what's going on.
Pissant politicians running an army train.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.738
Yes, sir.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.510
Havin' any problems?

07:07.511 --> 07:11.681
No. We're just making sure we're
not gonna have any, Lieutenant.

07:11.682 --> 07:15.017
- Newell, come with me a minute.
- For what, Captain?

07:15.018 --> 07:18.880
Major gave me a message from
the fort to be deciphered.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.927
Looks like you've got
room for one more.

07:49.928 --> 07:53.681
No civilians, except by special
permission from Washington.

07:53.682 --> 07:57.560
I'm a deputy US marshal.
Indian agent for the territory.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.395
The governor can tell ya.

07:59.396 --> 08:03.399
My orders are to accept no
unauthorised persons on this train.

08:03.400 --> 08:07.153
Dr Molyneux and the Reverend
Peabody are posted to Fort Humboldt.

08:07.154 --> 08:10.740
The young lady is a daughter
of the commandant at the fort.

08:10.741 --> 08:13.576
Why do you want to go to Humboldt?

08:13.577 --> 08:17.538
Levi Calhoun. He's in custody
up there. I wanna bring him back.

08:17.539 --> 08:20.958
- If ever a man deserved to hang...
- And hang he will.

08:20.959 --> 08:24.754
The sooner I can get up there,
the sooner he takes the drop.

08:24.755 --> 08:27.173
We can have him sent to
you under armed escort.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.634
You said that ain't army business.

08:29.635 --> 08:32.828
That way or no way.
Good day, Marshal.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.152
Major Claremont.
Locomotive's ready, sir.

08:48.153 --> 08:51.239
- Very well, Sergeant. Carry on.
- Major.

08:51.240 --> 08:54.935
I can't find Lieutenant
Newell or Captain Oakland.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.248
Corporal said Humboldt's
only two days up the line.

09:00.249 --> 09:03.068
Something funny's goin' on.

09:06.547 --> 09:09.032
Get the hell off here, son.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.053
Wonder why we ain't movin' yet.

09:14.054 --> 09:18.333
You sign up yesterday? Hurry up
and wait. Hurry up and wait.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.435
Right, I need eight
volunteers right now.

09:21.436 --> 09:25.815
You, you, you two. You.
You, Murphy. You too, Rafferty.

09:25.816 --> 09:28.943
Here's what I want you to do.
Go up and scour this town.

09:28.944 --> 09:32.989
Captain Oakland and Lieutenant Newell
are missin'. See if you can find 'em.

09:32.990 --> 09:35.725
Murphy and I will
take the small tent.

09:43.375 --> 09:46.210
Have you found them?

09:46.211 --> 09:49.698
- Not yet.
- Next time bring a nursemaid.

09:50.340 --> 09:54.844
- The train cannot be held any longer.
- You expect me to leave my officers?

09:54.845 --> 09:57.847
I'm very sorry. You know
the urgency of our mission.

09:57.848 --> 10:00.850
Just a goddamn minute.
Just once too often, friend.

10:00.851 --> 10:04.129
Put the gun away, friend.
What's your problem?

10:04.771 --> 10:08.383
Slippery Fingers here
took $120 off of me.

10:08.483 --> 10:12.278
- Maybe he's a good poker player.
- Too good to be true.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.973
Looks like a pretty fair hand to me.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.911
What's your name?

10:20.912 --> 10:22.997
John Deakin.

10:22.998 --> 10:25.442
Stand up.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.571
I said stand up.

10:34.092 --> 10:37.120
- No gun?
- I'm not a man of violence.

10:42.893 --> 10:46.254
What's known as playing
it close to the chest.

10:47.564 --> 10:51.092
That's not good
enough, Marshal. Outside.

10:55.030 --> 10:57.599
I'm not a man of violence.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.577
- That's enough.
- Not for me it's not.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.272
Marshal, look at this.

11:10.629 --> 11:14.532
"Wanted for theft, gambling
debts, arson and murder."

11:15.092 --> 11:20.330
"John Murray, alias John
Deakin, alias Hayes."

11:20.389 --> 11:23.224
"Former lecturer at the
University of Iowa."

11:23.225 --> 11:25.710
A lecturer in what, Mr Deakin?

11:26.853 --> 11:31.315
- Medicine.
- You don't expect us to believe that?

11:31.316 --> 11:33.609
Here. Listen to this.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.611
"Convicted of embezzlement."

11:35.612 --> 11:41.893
"Trapped in Lake's Crossing, where he
escaped under cover of a fire that he set."

11:42.369 --> 11:46.914
The whole town burned down.
Seven people killed.

11:46.915 --> 11:50.652
Seven people. My God,
Richard, that's awful.

11:50.794 --> 11:53.921
He blew up a wagonload
of explosives in Sharps.

11:53.922 --> 11:56.048
It's still not army business.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.927
Those explosives was on the way
to the presidio in San Francisco.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.971
That makes it army business.

12:01.972 --> 12:06.334
I'm pretty sure Mr Deakin here's
gonna be my ticket to Humboldt.

12:30.208 --> 12:34.295
So the governor here got hold of
some of his friends in Washington,

12:34.296 --> 12:37.866
had me appointed Indian
agent for the territory.

12:41.136 --> 12:44.054
More ways to pacify Indians
than shooting holes in 'em.

12:44.055 --> 12:48.418
But you did that, too.
In the line of duty, of course.

12:48.852 --> 12:52.213
Even back in Ohio,
we knew about Nathan Pearce.

12:52.731 --> 12:55.524
- Notorious, was I?
- No. Famous is more like it.

12:55.525 --> 12:58.261
"Famous" is a better word, Marshal.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.781
I must admire your spunk, young lady.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.742
It's not an easy life out here.

13:04.743 --> 13:09.731
How come you're making this trip if no
civilians are supposed to be aboard?

13:10.707 --> 13:13.151
I have friends in high places.

13:13.835 --> 13:17.254
Miss Scoville's joining her father,
at his urgent request.

13:17.255 --> 13:21.091
Gentlemen, I have a
hard day tomorrow.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.302
At my age, sleep is a necessity.

13:23.303 --> 13:27.207
- "A hard day tomorrow"?
- I have to check the medical supplies.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.810
We're cut off from the world now.

13:30.811 --> 13:35.131
May I please just know
what in the hell is going on?

13:37.818 --> 13:42.222
Governor, these are all
intelligent people.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.975
I think they have a right to know.

13:49.246 --> 13:52.106
Dr Molyneux here is a specialist.

13:53.208 --> 13:58.337
Your troops are not merely relief. They're
replacements for soldiers who've died.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.923
- Died?
- God save us. The Indians.

14:00.924 --> 14:05.135
Not Indians. Fort Humboldt is in
the grip of a diphtheria epidemic.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.846
Oh, Richard. My father.

14:06.847 --> 14:10.558
We're in daily contact with the fort,
Marica, and your father's fine.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.685
Why wasn't I told?

14:12.686 --> 14:16.730
Because we might have lost the rest of
your command, not only two officers.

14:16.731 --> 14:20.651
- They must have found out.
- Governor, how dare you expose a lady,

14:20.652 --> 14:26.073
- all of us, to this dreadful pestilence?
- We have provisions for a month.

14:26.074 --> 14:29.785
We'll remain aboard until Dr
Molyneux pronounces Humboldt clean.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.997
He's got as good a chance as
any of catching the diphtheria.

14:32.998 --> 14:36.667
I've already had
the disease. I'm immune.

14:36.668 --> 14:39.988
- Where'd you catch it?
- In Mexico. Why?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.198
Just curious.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.675
How many troops are
available for duty?

14:44.676 --> 14:47.203
- Gentlemen.
- Doctor.

14:47.929 --> 14:50.806
25 out of a garrison of 76.

14:50.807 --> 14:55.378
The others are too sick
for duty, or dead.

14:55.937 --> 14:59.148
- White Hand must like that.
- White Hand?

14:59.149 --> 15:02.927
Paiute chief. He needs watchin'.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.323
25 men. That's not even
enough for patrols.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.767
If you'll excuse me.

15:11.620 --> 15:14.955
Marica. Are you all right?

15:14.956 --> 15:17.750
Yes, of course.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.403
It's been a long day.

15:24.007 --> 15:26.467
Are you going to leave
him like this all night?

15:26.468 --> 15:29.345
I reckon we could turn
him loose in the morning.

15:29.346 --> 15:33.291
By then we'll be in snow country,
and he'll have no place to go.

15:34.309 --> 15:38.129
You sure got a mighty poor
choice for your pity, ma'am.

15:38.647 --> 15:42.316
Then you make a mighty poor
example of a lawman, Mr Pearce.

15:42.317 --> 15:45.094
A man is innocent
until proved guilty.

15:45.195 --> 15:48.431
But you've tried,
convicted and condemned.

15:48.448 --> 15:52.852
Show me the law that says you can
treat a man like a wild animal.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.769
You frightened me.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.646
I'm sorry.

17:02.647 --> 17:05.508
I didn't mean to.

17:06.151 --> 17:09.095
Aren't you afraid of
someone seeing you?

17:09.612 --> 17:13.141
I'm afraid we're not much
of a secret any more.

17:18.663 --> 17:21.874
You should have told me about
the epidemic at the fort.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.859
Why?

17:24.294 --> 17:26.502
You'd only have worried.

17:26.503 --> 17:29.173
Or are you afraid I might
have deserted, too?

17:29.174 --> 17:32.702
No, I'd never think that.

17:40.894 --> 17:44.505
Let's wait until we
get off the train.

19:02.058 --> 19:05.628
Can I get you something?
There's some food left.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.548
No, thanks.

19:09.232 --> 19:11.676
A drink?

19:12.735 --> 19:15.346
That I'll have.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.688
Would you untie my legs?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.481
Don't be silly.

19:51.482 --> 19:55.553
- I won't go anywhere, I promise.
- I'm sure you won't.

19:56.112 --> 19:59.640
I'm all cramped up and I
need the circulation.

20:00.825 --> 20:03.019
I give you my word.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.568
I'll only untie your legs.

20:11.294 --> 20:15.573
And if you want to hop off the train,

20:16.216 --> 20:18.701
it's a long hop to anywhere.

20:19.302 --> 20:21.412
There. Better?

20:22.639 --> 20:25.041
Give me a hand up?

20:28.645 --> 20:31.088
Oh, my God.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.690
You promised.

20:33.691 --> 20:37.277
When a man is a killer, arsonist,
a cheat and a coward,

20:37.278 --> 20:41.515
it's hardly surprising if he
turns out to be a liar as well.

20:42.533 --> 20:47.063
- Is your mother still alive?
- Yes. But what's that to do with you?

20:47.789 --> 20:50.900
- But she's not well.
- How do you know that?

20:52.335 --> 20:56.463
If she were, the commander of the
fort would be visited by his wife,

20:56.464 --> 20:58.949
and not his daughter.

20:59.217 --> 21:03.579
It's strange, you coming out
here with diphtheria around,

21:04.472 --> 21:07.416
and the Indians on the prod.

21:07.517 --> 21:11.436
It must have been an urgent
invitation that brought you.

21:11.437 --> 21:15.966
But not by letter. Your invitation
came by telegraph, right?

21:17.402 --> 21:21.947
- You gonna marry the governor?
- Really. This is quite intolerable.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.975
Before you leave, tie my hands again.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.895
Not so tightly.

21:29.914 --> 21:32.708
Why all this concern
and interest in me?

21:32.709 --> 21:36.570
I should have thought you,
Mr Deakin, had enough worries.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.117
I have.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.583
Thank you.

22:05.867 --> 22:09.870
Have Ferguson ready with his telegraph
equipment when we stop at 7.00.

22:09.871 --> 22:12.356
- And get Mr O'Brien.
- Yes, sir.

22:13.791 --> 22:17.044
- Why are we stopping?
- Morning, Governor.

22:17.045 --> 22:20.740
My orders are to contact
the fort daily at this hour.

22:21.632 --> 22:24.493
I hope you have no objection.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.554
Make it short, please, Major.

22:27.555 --> 22:30.207
Time's important.

23:00.296 --> 23:03.423
Fall out, everybody. Everybody out.

23:03.424 --> 23:06.218
Nice fresh air out here, men.
Everybody outside.

23:06.219 --> 23:08.387
Come on, get it out
of there, Bennett.

23:08.388 --> 23:12.474
Guard mounts for everybody. Murphy,
you post guards on the other side.

23:12.475 --> 23:18.313
And you, you, you and you, up on
the top. Keep your eyes open.

23:18.314 --> 23:22.651
White Hand's around here somewhere,
men, waiting to pounce on you little boys.

23:22.652 --> 23:26.655
So stay awake, stay alert,
and keep your iron unbuckled.

23:26.656 --> 23:28.448
I'll be right back.

23:28.449 --> 23:32.978
I've gotten through to them, Major,
and they've acknowledged.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.330
My regards to Colonel Scoville,

23:35.331 --> 23:39.735
and congratulations on the
capture of Levi Calhoun.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.961
That's the train, Calhoun.
What do I tell 'em?

24:00.189 --> 24:02.524
How do I know you won't
pull no fancy tricks?

24:02.525 --> 24:05.219
I swear I never would.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.601
I don't believe you, soldier.

24:14.036 --> 24:16.564
My God.

24:34.348 --> 24:36.959
The fort's answering, sir.

24:37.727 --> 24:43.106
As God is my witness, Calhoun,
I'll see you before a firing squad.

24:43.107 --> 24:45.609
Don't you give me
no trouble, Colonel.

24:45.610 --> 24:50.472
I got your bluebellies locked up.
By God, I'll skin 'em alive, one by each.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.319
Major Claremont.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.256
The epidemic's worsened.

25:08.257 --> 25:12.636
- Is there news of my father?
- It has his signature, so he must be fine.

25:12.637 --> 25:15.623
They're asking about
our time of arrival, sir.

25:18.601 --> 25:24.840
With this weather, I guess we'll be
at Breakheart Pass in about 20 hours.

25:26.984 --> 25:30.111
Transmit that. Add my
compliments to Colonel Scoville.

25:30.112 --> 25:34.449
Then get Myrtle City. Request word on
Captain Oakland and Lieutenant Newell.

25:34.450 --> 25:37.353
Yes, sir.

25:44.835 --> 25:48.572
- I can't get Myrtle City, Major.
- Keep trying.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.935
- Dead, sir.
- I don't understand how it could've gone.

26:01.936 --> 26:04.646
Weather's been good.
It worked yesterday.

26:04.647 --> 26:08.634
- Sergeant Bellew, board the troops.
- Yes, sir.

26:10.361 --> 26:12.737
Troopers, fall in. Board the train.

26:12.738 --> 26:15.907
Murphy, get 'em aboard.
You be sure you take a roll call.

26:15.908 --> 26:18.602
I don't wanna leave anybody behind.

26:35.678 --> 26:38.638
- Seen Dr Molyneux this morning?
- No, not yet.

26:38.639 --> 26:42.376
- Shall I send for him, Governor?
- No, it isn't necessary.

26:45.980 --> 26:50.676
Dr Molyneux had better adjust to army
schedules. We don't run a restaurant.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.878
Dr Molyneux.

27:09.879 --> 27:12.698
The governor asked for you, sir.

27:22.558 --> 27:25.419
It looks like some sort of seizure.

27:26.395 --> 27:28.589
Apoplexy, I'd say.

27:28.648 --> 27:31.232
You mind if I have a look?

27:31.233 --> 27:35.220
- What the devil for?
- I do know something about medicine.

27:35.446 --> 27:37.973
Why not, Major?

27:38.574 --> 27:40.684
All right.

27:48.501 --> 27:52.253
- The skin's broken above the left ear.
- Of course. He fell.

27:52.254 --> 27:55.882
- Died before a bruise could form.
- Apoplexy kills instantly.

27:55.883 --> 28:00.412
No, a seizure like that would turn
the lips and the fingers blue.

28:02.473 --> 28:05.100
It's lucky we have the law aboard.

28:05.101 --> 28:07.394
Now, what does that mean?

28:07.395 --> 28:11.215
There's a puncture. Right there.
Just below the ribs.

28:12.316 --> 28:16.986
Looks like somebody knocked him out,
stuck a surgical probe up under his ribs.

28:16.987 --> 28:19.681
God save us.

28:22.827 --> 28:26.897
- It's hard to believe.
- The fact is, we have a killer aboard.

28:30.126 --> 28:32.569
Yes, we have.

28:44.890 --> 28:48.309
Move it along, men. Murphy,
keep an eye on that detail.

28:48.310 --> 28:50.254
I'll check the drivers.

29:11.167 --> 29:16.171
Sergeant, as soon as the engineer is
finished, put the men back on the train.

29:16.172 --> 29:19.257
- We've got to move along.
- Yes, sir.

29:19.258 --> 29:23.287
Madigan, you and Bennett over
here, keep a sharp lookout.

29:33.355 --> 29:38.886
Keep them logs moving, men.
Think how lucky you are. You're warm.

29:58.756 --> 30:04.036
On the double. We don't have
all day. Get that wood up there.

30:46.679 --> 30:49.498
It's colder than hell out here.

31:40.524 --> 31:45.695
- Where's Deakin?
- Inside. Don't worry yourself.

31:45.696 --> 31:48.890
At least he's got good sense.

31:50.618 --> 31:54.354
Men on top, all aboard.
Back to your cars.

32:27.821 --> 32:32.934
Dr Molyneux is dead. Two of the
major's best officers are missing.

32:36.330 --> 32:39.900
And we can't get through
to Myrtle. Do you mind?

32:40.376 --> 32:42.335
Go ahead.

32:42.336 --> 32:45.463
Nobody heard anything.
Nobody saw anything.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.924
And nobody knows anything.

32:47.925 --> 32:50.619
It can only get better.

32:51.804 --> 32:55.682
Well, you know, maybe they
were accidents after all.

32:55.683 --> 32:57.793
We might have seen the end of it.

33:23.127 --> 33:25.503
Have you gone crazy?

33:25.504 --> 33:28.407
He fell. My fireman fell.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.929
He's dead.

33:34.930 --> 33:36.931
You can't be sure.

33:36.932 --> 33:39.668
Somebody better check on him.

33:40.269 --> 33:44.005
Somebody that knows
somethin' about doctoring.

33:57.494 --> 34:00.480
He might try to run off on us.

34:24.855 --> 34:28.550
Looks like every bone
in his body is busted.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.306
Move out, men.

34:55.803 --> 34:59.748
Can we make up the lost time?
Men are dying in that fort.

35:00.432 --> 35:05.170
- Sergeant Bellew, board the troops.
- Yes, sir. Troopers, fall in.

35:11.944 --> 35:16.181
Do you mind if I have a look
up there in that locomotive?

35:17.866 --> 35:21.394
If it's all right with the marshal,
it's all right with me.

35:22.371 --> 35:25.023
Go ahead.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.562
Whiskey. He was reeking with it.

36:04.913 --> 36:09.359
God is my witness, I never saw
Jackson touch that stuff.

36:19.261 --> 36:22.889
Trooper Rafferty reporting, sir.
I'm your new fireman.

36:22.890 --> 36:25.625
Hop up, young fella.

36:32.441 --> 36:34.942
Morning, sir.

36:34.943 --> 36:38.196
Good morning. You must
be Carlos the chef.

36:38.197 --> 36:42.350
I am. And you must be
Mr Deakin, the murderer.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.937
How about some coffee? It's hot.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.858
Thanks.

36:58.008 --> 37:00.035
Thank you.

37:06.475 --> 37:08.793
Marshal Pearce.

37:12.814 --> 37:17.777
You're all mighty relaxed in the face
of what's transpired aboard this train.

37:17.778 --> 37:21.598
- What?
- If Deakin's right, Molyneux was killed.

37:24.660 --> 37:28.829
The telegraph line to
Myrtle no longer works.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.958
It could be ice
or animals, even wind.

37:31.959 --> 37:36.404
I think this bears investigation,
more than you're giving it.

37:46.473 --> 37:49.308
Some little time ago I
had a choice, Colonel.

37:49.309 --> 37:51.628
Major.

37:52.271 --> 37:55.256
Keep your nose clean
and you'll get there.

37:55.691 --> 37:58.276
What about it?

37:58.277 --> 38:01.904
Never had no call to be a detective.

38:01.905 --> 38:05.241
We're gonna all be on
this train for a while.

38:05.242 --> 38:09.537
We just might find out what
happened before we have to get off.

38:09.538 --> 38:12.482
Could be you did it all.

38:17.713 --> 38:20.256
Could be.

38:20.257 --> 38:22.951
Or you.

38:45.866 --> 38:48.810
Oh, hell, we're stopping again.

38:54.916 --> 38:57.360
Oh, no.

38:58.253 --> 39:00.780
Oh, my God.

39:04.343 --> 39:07.871
- We're going backwards.
- Oh, my God.

39:15.520 --> 39:19.215
- He's right. We're not stopping.
- I know.

39:36.792 --> 39:38.793
What's going on?

39:38.794 --> 39:41.545
Quickly. Get in your bunks.
Down there.

39:41.546 --> 39:46.425
- Move. Get in those bunks and stay there.
- Sarge, I'm scared. What's going on?

39:46.426 --> 39:49.512
Lay down, and stay there.
Get back in your bunks.

39:49.513 --> 39:53.599
All of you, get back in your bunks.
It'll be all right. Stay in your bunks.

39:53.600 --> 39:57.086
Troopers, calm down. Don't panic.

40:05.946 --> 40:10.991
- God. It's locked from the outside.
- What the hell is going on here?

40:10.992 --> 40:13.686
Where's that brakeman?

40:14.329 --> 40:17.732
Where's that brakeman? Open it.

42:16.159 --> 42:19.995
It's broken. The metal
must have crystallised.

42:19.996 --> 42:25.209
- I don't know why the brakes didn't hold.
- Sounded like a gunshot to me.

42:25.210 --> 42:27.628
Thank God we didn't lose
the medical supplies.

42:27.629 --> 42:31.840
- Not much good without a doctor.
- You're a doctor. Least, so you said.

42:31.841 --> 42:35.344
- Not any more I'm not.
- Simple charity to your fellow man.

42:35.345 --> 42:38.498
My fellow man is about to hang me.

42:41.518 --> 42:44.712
Major, we must try for
more replacements.

42:51.653 --> 42:54.389
Major, you have to contact the fort.

42:55.824 --> 42:58.826
The telegraph set's in the
front of the supply wagon.

42:58.827 --> 43:01.562
Henry, telegraph set
in the supply wagon.

43:01.705 --> 43:05.483
Sooner or later, me and sonny
boy are gonna need some sleep.

43:13.842 --> 43:17.870
There's nothing you can do
about that. They're dead.

43:19.639 --> 43:21.765
So am I. Or as good as.

43:21.766 --> 43:26.754
It wasn't your fault. You were back there
with us. Nothing you could have done.

43:31.484 --> 43:34.095
It ain't there, sir.

43:34.529 --> 43:37.849
- What?
- The spare telegraph set. It's gone.

44:11.107 --> 44:15.136
Mighty glad to see you, White Hand.
You made good time.

44:15.445 --> 44:17.571
The train?

44:17.572 --> 44:19.573
It's comin'.

44:19.574 --> 44:22.769
- Soldiers?
- No word yet.

44:43.473 --> 44:45.792
Me, too, sonny boy.

44:46.101 --> 44:48.669
Me, too.

45:18.466 --> 45:21.285
All right. Six hours, no more.

45:21.803 --> 45:24.413
Take a compartment in the next car.

45:29.018 --> 45:31.879
Who's gonna watch the steam?

45:33.064 --> 45:36.692
I think we have someone
who can take care of that.

45:36.693 --> 45:40.863
Feed in the fuel to keep the
needle between 100 and 130.

45:40.864 --> 45:43.516
You got any questions?

45:47.036 --> 45:49.663
Use the wood pile on the left.

45:49.664 --> 45:52.316
The other's no good. It's wet.

50:25.690 --> 50:28.817
- He says they didn't wreck the troop cars.
- Son of a bitch.

50:28.818 --> 50:31.403
He ain't done yet, Jebbo.

50:31.404 --> 50:34.974
Hawkins, ask him what time
he gets to Breakheart Pass.

50:35.366 --> 50:38.894
Then tell him to stop the
train when he gets there.

50:39.787 --> 50:42.289
We'll have to get rid
of those soldiers.

50:42.290 --> 50:46.819
White Hand's gonna have to work
a mite harder than he figured.

50:59.682 --> 51:02.376
It's about time. It's almost morning.

51:05.271 --> 51:07.715
I'm hungry.

51:14.697 --> 51:17.641
Pressure's right up there.

51:25.625 --> 51:29.403
Go back and go to bed. You can
sleep the rest of the way.

52:50.585 --> 52:53.461
Mind if I help myself?

52:53.462 --> 52:56.156
Of course not, Major.

53:00.428 --> 53:02.913
What is it, Henry?

53:03.639 --> 53:06.333
I can't find the reverend.

53:13.441 --> 53:18.512
He can't be far. Only ten minutes
ago he was trying to save my soul.

53:19.030 --> 53:22.115
Could he have fallen off?

53:22.116 --> 53:27.187
- We could back up and look for him.
- Where's O'Brien? We'll back up.

53:28.581 --> 53:30.957
- No.
- My God, Richard.

53:30.958 --> 53:34.377
- Why not?
- Someone is trying to stop this train.

53:34.378 --> 53:38.924
- I will not allow that to happen.
- I can't believe you won't stop to look.

53:38.925 --> 53:43.996
Marica, darling, there are men dying at
that fort who desperately need our help.

53:44.180 --> 53:47.166
It's my responsibility
to get us there.

53:47.391 --> 53:52.963
If the reverend was stupid or unlucky
enough to have fallen off, I'm sorry.

53:54.607 --> 53:57.760
- We're going through.
- Governor.

53:58.236 --> 54:01.597
You are one superior son of a bitch.

54:04.200 --> 54:07.102
We'll search what's
left of this train.

54:49.495 --> 54:52.314
Who are you?

54:53.332 --> 54:55.776
John Deakin.

54:56.502 --> 54:58.946
What are you?

54:59.922 --> 55:03.300
He must have fallen off. If we
back up maybe five miles...

55:03.301 --> 55:06.161
He certainly wouldn't
have jumped off.

55:06.637 --> 55:10.890
Reverend Peabody was small. A big,
strong man could have thrown him off.

55:10.891 --> 55:15.312
Me, I have an alibi. Miss Scoville
obviously is not a strong man.

55:15.313 --> 55:18.106
But the rest of you
are big, strong men.

55:18.107 --> 55:21.234
What the hell are you talking about?

55:21.235 --> 55:24.571
You're pretty free
with your theories.

55:24.572 --> 55:27.057
And my whiskey.

55:29.327 --> 55:32.604
A damn sight better than
that whiskey back in Myrtle.

55:35.207 --> 55:38.527
Marshal. There's no need for that.

55:42.381 --> 55:44.908
Mr Deakin is not a man of violence.

55:46.844 --> 55:49.621
He told us what he's not,

55:50.431 --> 55:53.125
but not what he is.

01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:19.654
Carlos?

01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:23.575
Are you in there?

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:52.537
They're all gone.

01:03:52.538 --> 01:03:55.706
Carlos is gone, Deakin's gone.
The place is a goddamn mess.

01:03:55.707 --> 01:03:58.459
What are you talking about?
Talk sense, man.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:03.156
The ammunition boxes are open.
The coffins are open. They're gone.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:07.677
You're drunk.

01:04:07.678 --> 01:04:10.872
Drunk? I wish to hell I was drunk.

01:04:46.466 --> 01:04:49.286
Don't. You'll die if you do.

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:52.805
No, not me. Your friends out there.

01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:56.668
I'm gonna take my hand away.
Don't scream. You promise?

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:04.150
You damn fool. You'll get us both killed.
There's no help for you out there.

01:05:04.151 --> 01:05:07.595
Especially not from your
friend the governor.

01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:11.182
Don't scream.

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:19.206
I want you to hide me.

01:05:19.207 --> 01:05:21.459
Why should I?

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:24.545
To save both our lives.

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:27.506
I asked you this once before,
and you didn't tell me.

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:29.675
You'd better tell me now.

01:05:29.676 --> 01:05:31.995
Who are you?

01:05:32.179 --> 01:05:34.722
My name is John Deakin.
That's my real name.

01:05:34.723 --> 01:05:38.851
- I work for the US Secret Service.
- I don't believe you.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:41.588
Do you believe I'm a killer?

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:47.802
You've got about a minute
to make up your mind.

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:07.046
- Who is it?
- O'Brien, ma'am.

01:06:07.047 --> 01:06:10.033
Come in. The door's not locked.

01:06:15.389 --> 01:06:19.558
- What is it?
- The prisoner, Deakin. He's escaped.

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:22.395
Where could a man escape
to in this wilderness?

01:06:22.396 --> 01:06:26.983
That's the point, there is no place.
That's why we think he's still on the train.

01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:29.485
- And you think perhaps I had...?
- No.

01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:32.363
Just that he could have sneaked
in when you were asleep.

01:06:32.364 --> 01:06:35.475
I can assure you he isn't
hiding under my bed.

01:06:35.701 --> 01:06:38.144
Please excuse me.

01:06:49.423 --> 01:06:51.908
Tight squeeze.

01:06:52.426 --> 01:06:55.370
I'm a damn fool. Now please get out.

01:06:56.013 --> 01:07:01.418
I want you to do one more thing for me.
Go along and bring back the major.

01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:06.605
Nobody else. Just the major.
Don't even talk to anybody.

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:11.511
- But Governor Fairchild...
- Especially not Governor Fairchild.

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:14.013
Get on, now.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.726
- What in God's name?
- Put it away.

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:46.812
- You'll use it later.
- I don't believe a word of it.

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:51.192
What if I showed you 400 Winchester
rifles that were stolen from the factory?

01:07:51.193 --> 01:07:54.487
We've been tracking them
halfway across the country.

01:07:54.488 --> 01:07:57.849
They're on the train now,
in the supply car.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.896
All those men killed.

01:08:03.872 --> 01:08:05.664
The train half wrecked.

01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:08.918
- All that over stolen rifles?
- There's more to it than that.

01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:12.004
And the governor? Surely he'd
have nothing to do with it.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:16.091
I intend to see that Governor
Fairchild stands trial for murder.

01:08:16.093 --> 01:08:18.411
Major Claremont.

01:08:22.182 --> 01:08:24.265
Deakin must have got to him.

01:08:24.267 --> 01:08:26.352
Where in God's name can they be?

01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:29.939
In the supply wagon.
We've looked everywhere else.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:33.593
Find 'em and kill 'em. Both.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:40.225
I'm sorry.

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:44.370
- I want to see those rifles.
- You will.

01:08:44.371 --> 01:08:49.542
Miss Scoville, stay in the compartment,
and keep your door looked after we leave.

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.027
Understand?

01:09:22.117 --> 01:09:25.077
All right, stolen rifles.
Not worth all that killing.

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:27.121
Dr Molyneux... there was no reason.

01:09:27.122 --> 01:09:31.584
If you remember, Molyneux said he was
going to inspect the medical supplies.

01:09:31.585 --> 01:09:35.379
Rifles, dynamite, ammunition...

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.756
not much a doctor
would be interested in.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:40.341
My God. The diphtheria,
those men at the fort.

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:42.996
There is no diphtheria.

01:09:43.596 --> 01:09:46.182
Reverend Peabody didn't
go into the supplies.

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:49.310
I don't think he went
to church, either.

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:54.857
Mr Peabody was a secret service
operative for 15 years,

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:57.343
the last five of them with me.

01:10:36.691 --> 01:10:39.177
Don't touch that gun.

01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:44.849
Hey, point that thing the other way.
I'm just a working stiff.

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:48.811
The major's just in back.
Bring him over here.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.444
Get down.

01:11:00.548 --> 01:11:04.827
- Where's your gun?
- I don't have a gun. I'm just the engineer.

01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:09.666
- No.
- Jump.

01:11:11.226 --> 01:11:15.521
- Where's the gun?
- It's in the box.

01:11:15.522 --> 01:11:17.632
Underneath the seat.

01:11:25.115 --> 01:11:27.825
I don't know who you are,
but the law says...

01:11:27.826 --> 01:11:30.603
The law's who I am.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.943
Have a look behind that wood.

01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:10.951
They got onto something back
there in Myrtle, and died for it.

01:12:10.952 --> 01:12:14.689
Then when Jackson the
fireman spotted the bodies,

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:17.608
Banlon threw him off the train.

01:12:18.752 --> 01:12:21.253
Are you gonna listen
to this murderer?

01:12:21.254 --> 01:12:26.492
I looked at Jackson at the bottom of the
trestle... a head wound with a lot of blood.

01:12:26.593 --> 01:12:28.761
A dead man doesn't bleed.

01:12:28.762 --> 01:12:33.040
You probably hit him with a
wrench before you threw him off.

01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:38.937
Before God, Major, I don't
know what he's talking about.

01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:41.674
Major, sir, what do I do?

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:46.888
Keep your gun on Banlon.
If he moves, kill him.

01:12:49.616 --> 01:12:53.160
We'll have to crawl forward on
the roof and shoot him out.

01:12:53.161 --> 01:12:56.455
What for? He's driving us
right where we wanna go.

01:12:56.456 --> 01:12:59.041
Let's agree that Deakin is no idiot.

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:01.861
Why is he taking us there?

01:13:03.004 --> 01:13:05.698
Let's get 'er done.

01:13:08.093 --> 01:13:11.637
My job was to arrange
a train. I'm no gunman.

01:13:11.638 --> 01:13:14.540
That's true, O'Brien.

01:13:15.183 --> 01:13:19.796
But a noose would fit your neck
just as neatly as it would fit ours.

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:36.687
Hey, sonny boy.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:40.233
Give me the wrench there.

01:13:41.501 --> 01:13:45.404
The nut on the brake handle's loose.
Give me the wrench.

01:14:06.734 --> 01:14:09.762
You know how to run this thing?

01:14:09.863 --> 01:14:12.348
I think so.

01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:37.331
You suspected everybody else.
Why not me?

01:14:39.017 --> 01:14:41.768
Marshal Pearce was our
number one suspect.

01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:44.897
You didn't want him on the train.
That put you in the clear.

01:14:44.898 --> 01:14:47.983
What's ahead of us at the fort?
What's wrong there?

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:50.402
Calhoun's not in custody.

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:54.281
He's probably with White Hand,
and they're in control of the fort.

01:14:54.282 --> 01:14:56.241
My God, what for?

01:14:56.242 --> 01:15:01.121
Humboldt's a shipping point for all gold
and silver from California and Nevada.

01:15:01.122 --> 01:15:05.610
That's why everybody's
involved, except the girl.

01:15:05.919 --> 01:15:10.464
The Indians want the rifles
and ammunition back there.

01:15:10.465 --> 01:15:14.994
I figure they were gonna put the gold
and silver in the coffins and ship it back.

01:15:17.597 --> 01:15:22.335
There's a gun lined up on
you gents. Now stop the train.

01:15:55.969 --> 01:15:59.538
- You hurt?
- Only my dignity.

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:19.493
Breakheart Pass coming up.

01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:02.328
Where are the soldiers?

01:18:08.476 --> 01:18:11.170
Where are they, Deakin?

01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:33.526
- Here they come.
- Look.

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:42.118
Hang on.

01:18:49.559 --> 01:18:51.518
That son of a bitch.

01:18:51.519 --> 01:18:53.671
Why'd he stop now?

01:18:59.819 --> 01:19:02.471
This is where we get off.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:21.173
- You know anything about dynamite?
- Of course.

01:19:21.174 --> 01:19:26.245
Set this to blow the rails, but don't
light the fuse until I get back.

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:48.325
Why the hell are they shooting?

01:19:48.326 --> 01:19:54.039
Tell an Indian things'll be one way and
they're not, he'll think you crossed him.

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:59.361
- They know you, Marshal. Show yourself.
- Like hell.

01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:03.525
- You son of a bitch. What's going on?
- A man's aboard. He's got the engine.

01:21:03.526 --> 01:21:06.762
You dumb pilgrims.
Ain't nobody in that engine.

01:21:31.596 --> 01:21:34.639
Get the troopers at the fort,
but watch out for Calhoun.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.127
- When these blow, he'll ride out here.
- Right.

01:22:24.899 --> 01:22:30.262
If we get the pressure back up, I can
take her on in. Let's stoke her up.

01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:51.153
That's the train. Let's ride.

01:25:16.028 --> 01:25:21.642
Tell the Indians to form a work party and
replace that track with one from behind.

01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:32.277
Take the claw, put it in
like this, and pull down.

01:25:33.921 --> 01:25:37.950
Over here. Put it here,
like that, and pull it down.

01:25:48.394 --> 01:25:51.004
All right, take it away.

01:26:18.883 --> 01:26:21.759
Where's Fairchild?

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:24.204
The Palace car.

01:26:33.272 --> 01:26:35.591
Fairchild.

01:26:57.755 --> 01:27:00.965
Maybe you know what's
going on around here.

01:27:00.966 --> 01:27:02.743
No.

01:27:06.805 --> 01:27:09.557
Keep 'em working, O'Brien.

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:11.935
Let me go.

01:27:11.936 --> 01:27:15.047
Help.

01:27:19.652 --> 01:27:21.595
Help.

01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:29.077
Let her go.

01:27:29.078 --> 01:27:30.729
The hell I will.

01:28:51.952 --> 01:28:54.438
Fairchild.

01:30:24.253 --> 01:30:27.422
I reckon we've come
down to it, Deakin.

01:30:27.423 --> 01:30:31.409
You have a choice.
You could throw that gun down.

01:30:32.052 --> 01:30:34.538
I don't think I can do that.

01:31:11.758 --> 01:31:14.452
Are you all right?

01:31:21.727 --> 01:31:25.297
Your father's waiting
for you out there.
