that you knew.

I was like, "There's no way
this girl didn't know." Like, "What?"

03:04.142 --> 03:06.060
That's why it's so mind-blowing to me,

03:06.144 --> 03:08.813
because, like, soon as I found out
about you that day…

03:08.897 --> 03:12.775

It was March and everyone told me…

I'm talking everyone,

03:33.922 --> 03:36.382

03:36.466 --> 03:38.676

10:08.399 --> 10:10.067
-You look great.
-You too.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.278
Every time I see you,
I just get like, "wow."

10:12.361 --> 10:15.114
-I wanna be like you if I have a baby.
-Girl, you are.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.907
-[laughs]
-I promise.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.702
-This place is so cute.
-How are you? How's little Christian?

10:19.785 --> 10:21.412
-Good. He's so good.
-Yes?

10:21.495 --> 10:22.830
Is he letting you sleep?

10:22.913 --> 10:24.999
Well, not really, but I'm fine with it.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.751
-[laughs]
-It is what it is.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.461
[bartender] Can I get you a cocktail?

10:28.544 --> 10:30.963
-What are you drinking?
-Red wine and iced tea.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.299
I would love just a virgin something.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.967
-Non-alcoholic.
-Non-alcoholic.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.886
-I got you, then.
-You're not drinking?

10:36.969 --> 10:39.680
I'm still trying to figure out
the formula, breast pump,

10:39.764 --> 10:41.974
so that's why I'm kind of waiting to see.

10:42.058 --> 10:45.019
I feel like since I'm a mom,
my fashion sense is, like,

10:45.102 --> 10:48.689
a little less hoey,
a little more maternal.

10:48.773 --> 10:52.818
But I mean, no. No, who am I kidding?
No, I'm still a ho. [chuckles]

10:52.902 --> 10:56.030
-[Christine] Well, cheers, babe.
-Yeah, cheers. So great to see you.

10:56.113 --> 10:57.406
I kind of miss you.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.450
I'm actually glad
I saw you at the dog party.

10:59.533 --> 11:03.829
I saw you speaking with Emma,
and I think that was great for you to do.

11:03.913 --> 11:07.500
Believe it or not,
Emma was the least of my problems

11:07.583 --> 11:08.584
at that party.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.212
It was Mary just storming out
out of nowhere.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.172
I was I was so shocked.
I was so surprised.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.715
-Mm-hmm.
-But, I mean…

11:14.799 --> 11:17.009
Not even to look up and acknowledge me?

11:17.093 --> 11:20.346
Her and I haven't talked in so long,
I didn't know where we even stood.

11:20.429 --> 11:22.431
-Mm-hmm.
-[Christine] And I don't know why…

11:22.515 --> 11:24.183
Like, she got up and stormed out

11:24.266 --> 11:27.895
because I was breathing
the same air as her.

11:27.978 --> 11:31.649
I want to be friends with her,
but I always find her…

11:33.109 --> 11:34.485
defending other people,

11:34.568 --> 11:38.364
when her and I have had
the longest relationship out of everyone.

11:38.447 --> 11:41.325
And Mary's history shows

11:41.409 --> 11:44.161
she meets someone really quickly,
attaches with them,

11:44.245 --> 11:45.996
and then quickly forgets about me.

11:46.080 --> 11:50.584
So the loyalty thing
is just really what did it for me.

11:50.668 --> 11:54.463
-I'm just happy that you, my friend…
-[chuckles]

11:54.547 --> 11:56.632
…and Maya, my friend, were there,

11:56.716 --> 11:58.384
because I felt alienated.

11:59.468 --> 12:03.556
My thoughts… Again, because I always
give people the benefit of the doubt,

12:03.639 --> 12:08.352
obviously, tell Mary about your feelings
and that you miss her,

12:08.436 --> 12:10.438
especially if it means so much to you,

12:10.521 --> 12:12.565
and you've been friends for so long.

12:12.648 --> 12:15.651
I think it's worth to try.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.821
Sometimes, I just wanna vent
to people because I don't…

12:18.904 --> 12:21.240
I don't really…
Like, I don't talk to Mary.

12:21.323 --> 12:25.202
What are you gonna get
from you telling me how you feel about her

12:25.286 --> 12:26.620
if you love her?

12:28.748 --> 12:33.085
You're not gonna get anything from that
because she doesn't know how you feel.

12:33.711 --> 12:36.338
You have to understand,
also, that I'm in the middle,

12:36.422 --> 12:38.340
and then I'm in an awkward position,

12:38.424 --> 12:41.177
so she needs to know
how you're feeling, Christine.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.513
Even if you're not gonna be friends again.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.265
Yeah.

Hey, Jason, I'm working on
getting some listing in Studio City.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.132
It's 3,000 square feet.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.259

13:29.850 --> 13:30.893
I'll go take a look.

13:30.976 --> 13:34.730
You guys, I'm so excited.
I told you I'm working with Simu Liu.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.858
My Marvel superstar.
He's coming in the office today.

-Yeah.

-How did you meet him?

13:40.486 --> 13:42.947
It's so funny.
I met him through social media.

13:43.030 --> 13:46.450
We found out we had a mutual friend,
and he's looking for a house.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.702
That's great. Is he single?

13:48.786 --> 13:52.248
[Chrishell] Yeah. I went to dinner
with him, and really great guy.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.542
-[Maya] Nice.
-He's so nice.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.210
-I love that!
-[Chrishell] Yeah.

like, he's the guy.

right up in this street.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.515
A few months later, I read that some lady

14:09.598 --> 14:10.975
was sitting in his living room.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.142
Like, she broke in?

14:12.226 --> 14:15.813
She was just sitting in the living room.
Maybe it was Christine! I'm kidding.

14:15.896 --> 14:18.148
-What?
-[Maya laughing] I'm kidding!

14:18.232 --> 14:21.151
-It's something that she would do.

who is trailblazing through Hollywood.

I'm actually at your office.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.955
I'm so excited to have you here.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.875
Pretty fun considering
we just, like, met over Twitter…

15:17.958 --> 15:20.336
-[Chrishell] I know! I told them.
-[Simu] …however long ago.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.712
We met through social media,

15:21.795 --> 15:24.465
then we found out
we have a mutual friend, so then it…

15:24.548 --> 15:26.592
-[Simu] That's right.
-It's kind of meant to be.

15:26.675 --> 15:31.722
And now here we are, gonna get you
in your new amazing house that you're…

15:31.805 --> 15:32.640
[Simu] Yes.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.850
This is a big step for you, right? I mean…

15:34.934 --> 15:35.851
It is huge.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.229
Well, as you know, I mean,
I was cast all the way back in 2019.

15:39.313 --> 15:42.232
I mean, I was just
on such a different trajectory then,

15:42.316 --> 15:46.737
and I feel like I'm at a place in my life
where I need A, a little bit of privacy,

15:46.820 --> 15:49.657
and B, I think just a place to call home

15:49.740 --> 15:53.577
that'll really make me feel
like a celebration of how far I've come.

15:53.661 --> 15:57.164
And it's also so important for me
to be able to share that with my family,

15:57.247 --> 15:59.416
so, you know,
guest suites are a big thing.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.836
And in terms of price,
I'm thinking maybe between six and eight?

16:02.920 --> 16:05.172
-Okay. If that--
-[Simu] That'd be a good range.

16:05.255 --> 16:08.300
But I'm flexible,
especially for the right one.

16:08.384 --> 16:12.721
Okay, so, what are your deal-breakers,
and what is your wish list?

16:12.805 --> 16:15.432
Since I come from Canada,
which is a frozen tundra,

16:15.516 --> 16:18.185
and it's totally impractical
to own a pool,

16:18.268 --> 16:20.229
I never grew up with one, and I just…

16:20.312 --> 16:22.523
If I'm gonna live in California,
I need a pool.

16:22.606 --> 16:26.276
Okay, a pool, no problem.
That budget, we will absolutely--

16:26.360 --> 16:29.989
Right. I would say that's like,
high on the wish list, slash almost--

16:30.072 --> 16:31.240
[Chrishell] Oops.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.242
Sorry.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.160
[laughs] No, you're all good.
You all right?

16:35.244 --> 16:37.955
Okay. It's my fault
that I was trying to look cute.

16:38.038 --> 16:41.542
I have a big movie star coming in,
and now I tried too hard.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.294
-I'm sorry, Simu.
-Not at all. You look great.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.214
[Chrishell laughs and sighs] Okay.

16:47.297 --> 16:51.218
I would love… I know this is hard,
but I would love a basketball court.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.887
-I'm a big basketball fan. I love playing.
-Okay.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.890
I know that land is hard to come by
in the Hills, so I get it.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.643
Would you be open
to putting one in yourself?

16:59.727 --> 17:01.729
-Mm-hmm. As long as there's space.
-[Chrishell] Okay.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.189
There aren't many places
with basketball courts,

17:04.273 --> 17:05.190
but I'm gonna look.

17:05.274 --> 17:06.316
I appreciate that.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.943
-Okay.
-Thank you.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.363
Between what you're looking for
and your budget, this is very doable.

17:11.447 --> 17:12.781
You have a little time, right?

17:12.865 --> 17:14.241
-A little time.
-Couple months.

19:13.068 --> 19:14.528
but the closets are too small."

19:14.611 --> 19:18.866
So I think this is gonna be
really appealing to younger, kind of…

19:18.949 --> 19:21.451
-Yeah, couples.
-Couples, or single people.

19:21.535 --> 19:22.452
-Right.
-Whatever.

19:22.536 --> 19:25.956
A couple of staging items
just to kind of bring some color.

19:26.039 --> 19:29.293
[Vanessa] It doesn't need that much,
but, yeah, it will make it look better.

19:29.376 --> 19:32.713
[Mary] Yeah. So, what is up?
I haven't seen you in a couple of days.

19:32.796 --> 19:34.756
-[Vanessa] I know.
-[Mary] Anything new?

19:34.840 --> 19:37.843
Well, not much. You know,
I haven't been able to see the girls.

19:37.926 --> 19:41.013
I only spent some time
with Christine the other day.

19:41.096 --> 19:42.181
-Oh, really?
-[Vanessa] Yeah.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.224
We had a nice conversation,

19:44.308 --> 19:47.644
and, well, I'm just bringing this up,

19:47.728 --> 19:49.688
because I think
it's important for me to say.

19:49.771 --> 19:50.647
-Um…
-Uh-oh.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.358
-[both laugh]
-No, it's not anything bad.

19:53.442 --> 19:57.279
No, I think that she has
a lot of love for you still.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.865
[Vanessa] Mary and Christine
used to be like sisters.

19:59.948 --> 20:03.535
I definitely see that there was
a beautiful friendship there,

20:03.619 --> 20:05.787
and now they're really mad to each other.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.164
But life is too short.

20:07.247 --> 20:12.711
And if you ask me, I would give anything
to have more time with my sister.

20:12.794 --> 20:15.297
If you maybe have a conversation together…

20:15.380 --> 20:17.341
I always try to see the good in people.

20:17.424 --> 20:18.634
I've been through this.

20:18.717 --> 20:24.223
I can't have all of her ups
and downs and unstabilities,

20:24.306 --> 20:27.100
like, in my head because it confuses me.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.811
She says she misses me,
doesn't invite me to the shower.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.981
She invited you, who she just met.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.233
-Yeah.
-She didn't invite me.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.275
I'm like, "Really?"

20:35.359 --> 20:39.655
You miss me and love me,
but you are doing things on a daily basis

20:39.738 --> 20:43.200
that completely contradict
what you're saying.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.035
I don't like that negative energy,

20:45.118 --> 20:48.455
and I am not going
to allow it in my life anymore.

20:48.538 --> 20:51.041
It's been years of this,
and I keep being betrayed.

20:51.124 --> 20:55.003
The way she is with me
looks like she's sweet and caring.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.589
-But--
-She does that, that's her whole MO.

20:57.673 --> 21:01.760
I mean, where she's super nice
to people's faces until she's not.

21:01.843 --> 21:05.347
Christine told me that, you know,
loyalty is very important to her.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.265
[Mary] Uh-huh.

21:06.348 --> 21:09.893
Being her minion is important to her,
just doing anything she says.

21:09.977 --> 21:12.229
"If you don't like someone,
I don't like someone."

21:12.312 --> 21:15.148
She gets mad at people
for so many different reasons,

21:15.232 --> 21:17.693
and I don't think
she knows what loyalty is.

21:17.776 --> 21:22.823
Like, I am a loyal friend,
and I gave her chance after chance.

21:22.906 --> 21:27.160
Okay, so even though I feel that you are,
obviously, you know, done with her,

21:27.244 --> 21:30.914
how do we feel, maybe have a face-to-face
conversation with her, maybe just to--

21:30.998 --> 21:32.416
I'm really not interested.

21:32.499 --> 21:35.335
I know who she is now,
and I just don't want any involvement.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.588
What if she showed up at the office,
like, "I want to talk to you"?

21:38.672 --> 21:40.632
Stop talking. Now. Stop.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.551
My stance is not gonna change.

21:43.218 --> 21:46.972
I don't want anybody
coming to me trying to mend this,

21:47.055 --> 21:48.932
because there is no mending anymore.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.726
I want her out of my life.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.186
Just please stay out of it.

about bringing Davina back?

22:54.122 --> 22:55.957
Well, I decided to bring her back.

-Positivity.
-…keeping things positive, yes.

we obviously had a difficult past,

25:45.710 --> 25:47.087
and I just wanna apologize.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.839
I'm really sorry
for hurting your feelings, genuinely,

25:49.923 --> 25:51.675
and that was not my intention.

25:51.758 --> 25:55.053
It was just a thoughtless comment
that was offensive,

25:55.136 --> 25:58.348
and I'm sorry for hurting
your feelings. I really am.

25:58.431 --> 26:00.475

-Sure.
-It's been a long time.

It would have been a little more genuine
if you'd said it before.

26:08.316 --> 26:12.779
It is genuine, and just so you understand
from my perspective,

26:12.862 --> 26:14.364
I didn't have any information,

26:14.447 --> 26:18.368
I felt like you weren't very open with me,
and maybe I wasn't either, you know?

26:18.451 --> 26:21.580
I wasn't open with you because I was
going through a divorce publicly,

26:21.663 --> 26:22.747

28:27.330 --> 28:31.584
I'm sure you'll be an amazing mom,
and you’ll balance everything you can.

28:31.668 --> 28:32.752
Sorry, I'm struggling.

28:32.836 --> 28:35.255
There's a couple behind us,
just making out there,

28:35.338 --> 28:37.048
almost about to have sex on the couch.

28:37.132 --> 28:39.217
Look, look! It's really gross.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.719
I don't wanna break my neck.

28:40.802 --> 28:44.055
Oh, that's… Yeah, wow,
that's quite a situation. Yeah.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.433
It's been a while
since I was like that in public.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.476
I don't even think I was like that.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.520
They just have to be careful tonight,

28:50.603 --> 28:54.232
because, you know, nine months from now
things can look very different.

28:54.315 --> 28:57.819
You know, Heather is doing a party
with her and Tarek to celebrate love.

28:57.902 --> 29:01.322
It's on a yacht. Are you guys coming?
I think it's in a week or two.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.742
-Uh, I'm not invited.
-I don't know about this.

29:03.825 --> 29:05.118
-Are you invited?
-No.

29:05.201 --> 29:07.579
-Aw! Really?
-Oops. Okay. Never mind.

29:07.662 --> 29:10.165
-But you're okay with Heather.
-I'm great with her.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.876
Maybe because you weren't
in the office, and you…

29:12.959 --> 29:15.044
Maybe, but why wouldn't
Christine be invited?

29:15.128 --> 29:16.421
You're cool with her, right?

29:16.504 --> 29:18.923
I thought Heather and I were,
like, on good ter…

29:19.007 --> 29:22.969
I just feel like,
since she met her fiancé,

29:23.052 --> 29:27.640
she's been, you know, like,
in his bubble, in his world, in his land,

29:27.724 --> 29:29.809
and she just kind of left me in the dust.

29:29.893 --> 29:33.730
I invited Heather to my baby shower.
She didn't come, but I did invite her.

29:33.813 --> 29:36.733
So I'm not really sure
what I've done wrong.

29:36.816 --> 29:41.529
I feel like it's more
coming from him than her.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.822
Why from him?

29:42.906 --> 29:44.616
'Cause I said some things.

29:44.699 --> 29:46.493
I saw in one of the interviews.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.328
I got you a lot of press, Tarek.

29:48.411 --> 29:51.748
You're welcome.
I don't feel like I did anything wrong.

29:51.831 --> 29:55.043
[Davina] We were laughing.
I didn't think she would get offended.

29:55.126 --> 29:58.630
I didn't she would either,
but, you know, she's very sensitive.

29:58.713 --> 30:01.090
-She's very sensitive.
-I feel like you'll be fine.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.550
I haven't seen her in so long,

30:02.634 --> 30:05.720
because Mary has this theme of,
like, cock-blocking people,

30:05.804 --> 30:07.055
so I never see them.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.434
We are celebrating
your welcome back to the office.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.395
-I know.
-So wait. So how did that go?

30:14.479 --> 30:16.439
I was nervous,
I wasn't sure what to expect,

30:16.523 --> 30:19.859
but it was actually really nice,
and the vibe was a lot better.

30:19.943 --> 30:23.112
-I feel like it was a good vibe, right?
-[Maya] I thought it was great.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.949
[Davina] Really good.
Vanessa was a doll. She's really sweet.

30:26.032 --> 30:27.617
-Yeah, she is.
-[Davina] Emma was there.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.868
She was really nice too.

30:28.952 --> 30:32.330
How was it with Chrishell?
You know, I heard you apologize.

30:32.413 --> 30:36.334
So I pulled her aside, and I was like,
"I just want to clear the air,

30:36.417 --> 30:40.839
and apologize to you,
and I'm really sorry about what happened."

30:40.922 --> 30:43.675
She was just like,
"I don't feel like you're very genuine."

30:43.758 --> 30:45.051
Thank you so much.

30:45.134 --> 30:49.597
I'm, like, really trying here, you know?
I don't know what else I could do.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.015
[Christine] She's really bitter,

30:51.099 --> 30:52.809
and, honestly, I feel bad for her.

30:52.892 --> 30:55.019
That's a horrible place to be,

30:55.103 --> 30:57.730
-but you can't take it personally.
-[Davina] I mean, hopefully,

30:57.814 --> 31:00.692
things will kind of evolve a little bit.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.318
-Cheers to…
-[both] Cheers.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.612
-…the new O Group vibe?
-Yes!

-[Mary] Yeah.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.217
Your client is gonna absolutely love it.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.927
-I love it.
-[Mary] I know! [laughs]

31:28.678 --> 31:32.599
French's house fell out of escrow,
and it's so frustrating

31:32.682 --> 31:36.477
so I'm hoping
that Emma's client will like the house,

31:36.561 --> 31:39.522
bring us an offer,
and we'll get this back in escrow soon.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.441
Oh, wow.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.652
[Mary] It's five bedrooms inside,
then you've got the guest house,

31:44.736 --> 31:46.029
music studio down below,

31:46.112 --> 31:48.364
and a full studio apartment.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.867
-[Emma] Wow, it's big.
-[Mary] Yeah, it is.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.577
[Emma] This is amazing.

31:52.660 --> 31:54.787
I love this!

31:54.871 --> 31:56.623
[Mary] Such an entertainer's home.

31:57.206 --> 32:00.710
Speaking of entertaining, the dog party…

32:01.544 --> 32:03.171
Yeah, that was interesting.

32:03.254 --> 32:06.174
Yeah, "interesting" being
an understatement of the year.

32:06.257 --> 32:07.508
[Mary] So, what happened?

32:07.592 --> 32:09.886
I might need to put my bag down for this.

32:09.969 --> 32:13.389
I sat there trying to be respectful,
and give her the benefit of the doubt.

32:13.473 --> 32:16.017
-Yeah.
-[Emma] Because she just had a baby.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.894
I was like, "Maybe she's changed."

32:17.977 --> 32:19.729
"Maybe she's a better person,"

32:19.812 --> 32:22.523
and then she lied the entire time.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.983
What'd she say?

32:24.067 --> 32:26.694
That our mutual ex proposed to her.

32:27.904 --> 32:30.031
-I know. You might just pass out now.
-What?!

32:30.114 --> 32:32.450
She never had a ring.
They were never engaged.

32:32.533 --> 32:34.869
He didn't even give her a key to his place

32:34.953 --> 32:36.579
because she was so crazy.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.706
That is a bold-faced lie.

32:38.790 --> 32:42.043
Like, let's hook her up to a lie detector,
because it would break.

32:42.126 --> 32:43.753
-[laughs]
-Okay? Like…

32:43.836 --> 32:45.338
Oh, my God. Where's the ring?

32:45.421 --> 32:49.884
Oh! She was like, "I wasn't sure
if he gave you the ring that he gave me."

32:50.551 --> 32:54.222
Well, he didn't give me an imaginary ring.
He gave me a real, big diamond.

32:54.305 --> 32:57.517
What?!
He put Jason and Brett through the wringer

32:57.600 --> 33:00.853
trying to pick out
the most perfect ring for you.

33:00.937 --> 33:03.106
-I know.
-So she's just saying this to you--

33:03.189 --> 33:05.650
Oh, and, by the way, she only told Davina.

33:08.027 --> 33:10.655
[Mary] Davina wasn't… Wait.
Davina wasn't even at the brokerage.

33:10.738 --> 33:12.240
Thank you, Mary.

33:12.323 --> 33:13.449
Thank you. I know.

33:13.533 --> 33:16.494
-She came… Oh, my God. She--
-[Emma] None of it adds up.

33:16.577 --> 33:18.746
Christine dated this guy
a whole year and a half

33:18.830 --> 33:21.249
before Davina even came around,

33:21.332 --> 33:24.585
so she is completely caught in this lie.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.422
She wanted to come off,
in that moment, like the victim,

33:27.505 --> 33:30.550
when she is the farthest thing
from a victim.

33:30.633 --> 33:34.262
-Why can't she just, like, be normal?
-She can't help herself.

33:34.345 --> 33:37.306
Just be like, "Yeah,
maybe I was just jealous and upset,

33:37.390 --> 33:38.975
because I wasn't over him yet,

33:39.058 --> 33:41.352
and saw you guys together,
and went ape shit."

33:41.436 --> 33:45.773
-That's probably what really happened.
-I would appreciate that so much more.

33:45.857 --> 33:49.777
It's like, you guys had not been together,
and why weren't they together?

33:49.861 --> 33:50.862
Wasn't his fault.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.281
So, like, let's just be honest here.

33:53.364 --> 33:56.534
I really don't know how she thinks
she's gonna get away with it,

33:56.617 --> 33:58.578
when everybody around you knows the truth.

33:58.661 --> 34:01.539
[Emma] I don't harbor resentment
against people forever,

34:01.622 --> 34:03.708
but why is she still making up lies?

34:03.791 --> 34:06.878
All you have to do is come,
be nice, don't do fucked-up shit.

34:06.961 --> 34:09.422
I'm the nicest person in the world.
I would've babysat!

34:09.505 --> 34:10.965
-[laughs]
-I would have-- Seriously!

34:11.049 --> 34:14.510
Christine is a very jealous person,
and I think that, in her mind,

34:14.594 --> 34:16.220
I'm the girl that came in

34:16.304 --> 34:20.099
and stole the life that she wanted,
the guy that she wanted,

34:20.183 --> 34:23.061
and she's trying to ruin
my reputation by making me out

34:23.144 --> 34:25.313
to be some homewrecker, which isn't true.

34:25.396 --> 34:26.647
She just can't let it go.

34:27.732 --> 34:30.318
I don't know why she thinks it's okay
to behave the way she does.

34:30.401 --> 34:31.444
I was so excited

34:31.527 --> 34:33.196
to come in and work with everybody.

34:33.279 --> 34:34.739
We had such a positive group.

34:34.822 --> 34:36.908
-We love having you.
-I know. I love being there.

34:36.991 --> 34:39.452
But when she's around,
everybody's on edge.

34:39.535 --> 34:41.287
You see everyone's demeanor change.

34:41.370 --> 34:42.371
-I know.
-Everyone's.

34:42.455 --> 34:46.375
Anybody that is a remote threat
to her is terrorized.

34:46.459 --> 34:48.711
There's no end to it either.

34:48.795 --> 34:52.173
I don't deserve
to be in that type of environment.

34:52.256 --> 34:56.135
No one deserves to be in an environment
with such a toxic human.

34:56.719 --> 34:59.055
I hope that Jason and Brett
can understand that,

34:59.138 --> 35:00.807
but I'm done, the gloves are off.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.475
I don't want to work with her,

35:02.558 --> 35:06.312
so it's gonna come down to a point
where it's gonna be me or her.
