00:06.174 --> 00:07.675
(Footsteps)

00:09.010 --> 00:10.386
(Squeaking)

00:15.683 --> 00:17.143
(Fizzling sound)

00:17.852 --> 00:20.771
(Siren blaring in distance)

01:09.570 --> 01:12.823
(Scully) Not eveiything is a conspiracy.
You're shaking.

01:12.907 --> 01:15.284
(Mulder) One at a time. What's going on?

01:15.368 --> 01:17.328
- (Man) Frohike's close.
- Don't use my name!

01:17.411 --> 01:19.288
Now I'll have to kill you!

01:19.372 --> 01:22.500
(Man) Langley and I
did three sweeps with the cpm-700.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.502
(Frohike) The cpm-700 is a piece of crap!

01:24.585 --> 01:26.963
(Man) The acoustic correlator
is reading passive sounds.

01:27.046 --> 01:30.132
(Mulder) I still don't know
what the hell is wrong!

01:30.216 --> 01:32.969
No one would kill you, frohike.
You're a puppy dog.

01:33.052 --> 01:37.890
(Man 2) I don't say any more until the
csm-25 counter measure filter is activated.

01:37.974 --> 01:39.725
(Garbled voices)

01:41.352 --> 01:42.561
(Static)

01:43.187 --> 01:45.856
(Man) Nothing can cut through the csm-25.

01:45.940 --> 01:50.653
(Scully) Ok, ok.
Now tell us what you're so close to.

01:50.987 --> 01:53.489
(Frohike) Not a what, a who.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.908
If you find the starting
point and follow it,

01:55.992 --> 01:58.995
not even secrets
of the darkest of men are safe.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.580
(Mulder) Cancer man?

02:03.165 --> 02:06.294
- What did you find?
- (Frohike) Possibly everything.

02:06.460 --> 02:10.631
Maybe his background, who he is,
and who he wants to be.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.937
August 20th, 1940, Mexico City.

03:07.188 --> 03:10.775
A stalinist agent assassinated
Leon trotsky with an ice pick.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.069
At that same moment,
a thousand miles north,

03:13.152 --> 03:16.989
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he appears.

03:17.073 --> 03:19.784
The father was
an ardent communist activist.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.995
During the Nazi-Soviet pact,
he kept the nk VD informed...

03:23.079 --> 03:25.664
On American plans to enter world war ii.

03:25.748 --> 03:29.835
He was executed
under the espionage act of 1917...

03:29.919 --> 03:32.171
Before his boy could walk.

03:32.254 --> 03:35.758
The mother, a cigarette smoker,
died of lung cancer...

03:35.841 --> 03:39.136
Before her son uttered his first word.

03:39.220 --> 03:42.139
With no family,
he became a ward of the state...

03:42.223 --> 03:44.934
Sent to various orphanages
in the midwest.

03:45.017 --> 03:46.352
Didn't make friends.

03:46.435 --> 03:49.855
Spent all his time reading - alone.

03:49.939 --> 03:53.109
And then... he appears to have vanished...

03:53.192 --> 03:56.695
Until a year and a
half after the bay of pigs.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.993
(Man) Premier khrushchev, we want you!

04:03.077 --> 04:06.205
(Troops) Premier khrushchev, we want you!

04:06.288 --> 04:09.166
We're gonna kick your rang-a-dang-doo!

04:09.250 --> 04:12.378
We're gonna kick your rang-a-dang-doo!

04:12.461 --> 04:15.297
Fidel Castro, we want you!

04:15.381 --> 04:18.300
Fidel Castro, we want you!

04:18.384 --> 04:21.011
We're gonna kick your rang-a-dang-doo!

04:21.095 --> 04:23.973
We're gonna kick your rang-a-dang-doo!

04:24.473 --> 04:25.891
Mother Russia...

04:29.895 --> 04:32.898
(Man) I wanna see that
when you're done with it.

04:37.695 --> 04:39.488
Why don't you go see the movie?

04:40.197 --> 04:45.035
I'd rather read the worst novel ever written
than sit through the best movie ever made.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.037
Captain, sir!

04:47.163 --> 04:50.624
General Francis requests
you report to his office asap, sir!

04:53.502 --> 04:56.714
My one-year-old just said his first word.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.635
- What was the word?
- Jfk.

05:05.723 --> 05:08.017
Catch ya later, mulder.

05:19.862 --> 05:22.031
- (Buzzer)
- (Man) He's here, sir.

05:23.282 --> 05:24.283
Send him in.

05:30.456 --> 05:32.541
You wish to see me, sir?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.919
Have a seat, captain.

05:38.214 --> 05:43.135
Captain, have you ever seen these two men,
met the general, or myself?

05:43.427 --> 05:44.637
No, sir.

05:44.762 --> 05:48.766
In January, 1961,
did you aid Congo president kasavuba...

05:48.849 --> 05:52.019
In the arrest and assassination
of patrice lumumba?

05:52.102 --> 05:53.145
No, sir.

05:53.270 --> 05:56.774
Did you train Cuban nationals
during operation zapata...

05:56.857 --> 05:59.151
Also known as the bay of pigs?

05:59.235 --> 06:02.071
I'm sorry, I'm unaware of
any such operation.

06:02.321 --> 06:03.822
On may 31st, 1961...

06:03.906 --> 06:08.327
Did you aid Dominican locals
in the assassination of Rafael trujillo?

06:08.410 --> 06:10.329
No, sir.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.917
Your father was a convicted spy
for the Soviet union.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.295
Executed in a Louisiana electric chair,
was he not?

06:21.382 --> 06:24.843
My only regret, sir, is I was too young
to throw the switch myself.

06:25.344 --> 06:30.766
At ease, captain. Your father's actions
were totally out of your control.

06:30.849 --> 06:36.105
Each of us in this room understands a
life eviscerated by the actions of another.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.648
Cigarette?

06:37.940 --> 06:40.818
No, thank you, sir. I never touch 'em.

06:40.901 --> 06:46.949
You see, most people seek to control life's
events in order to secure a more positive...

06:47.032 --> 06:49.910
Productive and free existence.

06:49.994 --> 06:54.665
Often, however, the objectives of others
conflict with our objectives.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.501
Viva la libertad.

06:57.585 --> 07:00.754
Now, most people -
common people, really -

07:00.838 --> 07:05.676
can barely manage to control
their own self-centred, myopic existence.

07:08.262 --> 07:11.682
They command lawyers
armed with paper weapons...

07:11.765 --> 07:16.228
Attacking with spiteful, vengeful,
cowardly litigation.

07:16.437 --> 07:17.980
Others...

07:18.856 --> 07:22.401
Operate within
elephantine bureaucracies.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.404
And then, captain...

07:27.823 --> 07:30.409
There are extraordinary men.

07:32.244 --> 07:37.916
Those who must identify, comprehend and
ultimately shoulder the responsibility...

07:38.000 --> 07:40.753
For not only their own existence...

07:40.836 --> 07:44.256
But their country's,
and the world's as well.

07:45.633 --> 07:49.136
Your father, captain, believed his country

07:49.219 --> 07:51.764
should look to
another form of government...

07:51.847 --> 07:54.725
And he took control of that belief.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.645
So, in that respect...

07:57.728 --> 08:00.439
We view him as an extraordinary man.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.192
And we believe...

08:04.443 --> 08:08.238
We know, captain,
that it runs in the family.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.617
Now, don't misunderstand.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.244
Your father should have been executed.

08:14.328 --> 08:18.123
Communism is the most heinous
personification of evil...

08:18.207 --> 08:20.626
Mankind has ever confronted.

08:20.709 --> 08:25.422
And it is, in part, the reason
that you are before us here today.

08:33.013 --> 08:39.144
You must understand everything I'm about
to say is classified "compartmentalised."

08:39.227 --> 08:41.813
So intensely
that if you accept this assignment...

08:41.897 --> 08:46.068
And successfully execute it, you will
no longer be an officer of the us army...

08:46.151 --> 08:49.321
Nor will any record
exist of your service.

08:52.658 --> 08:54.702
The assignment...

08:54.785 --> 08:58.414
Is the assassination
of an American civilian, aged 46...

08:58.497 --> 09:01.875
Former naval pt boat commander.

09:03.711 --> 09:06.171
Married, father of two.

09:16.223 --> 09:21.311
Last week this country was brought
to the brink of nuclear annihilation.

09:21.395 --> 09:27.776
A situation which never would have arisen
had the individual, as commander in chief...

09:27.860 --> 09:33.365
Provided an umbrella of air support
during the invasion at bahia de cochinos.

09:34.450 --> 09:35.951
Is there a cover story?

09:36.034 --> 09:38.495
Tell 'em it was done
by men from outer space.

09:38.579 --> 09:41.874
We've found and are setting up a patsy.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.133
Where?

10:04.897 --> 10:07.566
You shouldn't smoke those, Lee.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.486
I'm reading studies
that say they can kill you.

10:10.736 --> 10:11.737
Well...

10:12.946 --> 10:14.198
Mr hunt...

10:14.698 --> 10:15.741
Sir...

10:15.824 --> 10:18.619
I've, uh, heard about
those reports and...

10:18.702 --> 10:20.788
They are no doubt correct.

10:20.871 --> 10:24.166
You'll have a good view
of the president today.

10:25.083 --> 10:28.670
I like the president's family.
They're interesting people.

10:28.754 --> 10:32.299
However, I have my own views
on the president's national policy.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.802
I'll probably just eat lunch.

10:34.885 --> 10:37.471
I'm going to the movies
at the Texas theatre.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.723
It's only 90 cents.

10:40.224 --> 10:42.226
I love the movies.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.439
I brought the curtain rods, Lee.

10:57.908 --> 11:00.702
I bought some
just like this back in march.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.454
You did?

11:03.038 --> 11:04.373
Or aj hidell?

11:04.456 --> 11:08.752
Well, mr hunt,
fidel's defenders have to be careful.

11:08.836 --> 11:11.171
Yes, we do.

11:11.255 --> 11:15.801
I've informed our fellow defender that you'll
hide the curtain rods on the 6th floor...

11:15.884 --> 11:20.055
Of the book depository,
behind the cartons against the back wall.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.182
The Cuban visa?

11:22.266 --> 11:26.228
Once I've been notified the rods
have been removed from the depository...

11:26.311 --> 11:29.982
The visa and the money for your trip
will be in your room.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.025
Take a bus.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.779
I left all my money with my wife.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.036
That's all I've got: 13 and change.

11:44.872 --> 11:49.251
You better get going, Lee. You wouldn't
want to miss your ride to work.

12:22.951 --> 12:25.245
(Shuffling sound)

12:30.709 --> 12:34.338
Oh! Good morning, Lee.
Starting work right on time.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.923
Yes, sir.

13:12.084 --> 13:16.088
The president should be driving past any
minute. Everyone's down on the 5th floor.

13:16.171 --> 13:18.048
Where's Lee? Does he wanna come?

13:31.812 --> 13:33.855
(Chattering)

13:45.325 --> 13:47.744
(Cheering)

13:49.788 --> 13:54.501
(Man on radio) The president's car
is now turning onto elm street.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.381
(Sighs)

13:59.464 --> 14:01.758
I was on the stemmons freeway earlier...

14:01.842 --> 14:05.762
And it was jam-packed with spectators
waiting to see the president.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.931
People are really starting to crowd in.

14:10.726 --> 14:13.937
(Buzzing sound)

14:14.021 --> 14:16.940
The motorcade
is heading down elm street now...

14:17.024 --> 14:20.444
Passing the Texas
school book depository.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.323
(Gunshot)

14:26.908 --> 14:28.577
(People screaming)

14:30.454 --> 14:35.333
I can't quite see from here. Something
has happened on the motorcade route.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.961
Does anyone know what happened?
Is there any information?

14:38.045 --> 14:39.629
(Man) Upstairs!

14:39.713 --> 14:42.507
- Do you know this man?
- Yes, he works for me.

14:42.758 --> 14:43.925
Let's go!

14:44.009 --> 14:46.136
(People shouting)

14:46.219 --> 14:48.930
(Sirens blaring, people shouting)

14:49.014 --> 14:52.142
(Man on radio) The president
of the United States is dead.

14:52.225 --> 14:56.021
It is official now.
President Kennedy is dead.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.321
No! No! No, sir!

15:04.404 --> 15:06.323
I won't be a patsy.

15:17.751 --> 15:21.463
(Police radio)

15:21.713 --> 15:25.759
Should be considered dangerous,
and use caution approaching.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.636
Afternoon.

15:27.719 --> 15:31.223
(Radio continues)

15:33.141 --> 15:35.727
I wish to see
some form of identification, sir.

15:35.811 --> 15:37.687
Now easy there, partner.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.648
I just wanna talk a minute.

15:39.731 --> 15:43.151
If I don't see valid credentials,
I'm gonna assume you're with them.

15:43.235 --> 15:45.445
Them? What do you mean, partner?

15:45.529 --> 15:46.822
(Gunshots)

15:52.619 --> 15:55.080
How about a cigarette?

15:55.163 --> 15:57.082
Thank you.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.336
You know, keiffer knocked out a bunker.

16:02.254 --> 16:04.381
All by himself, too.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.843
(Soldier 2) More guts than me.
All I did was pick up the spoils.

16:07.926 --> 16:10.011
(Soldier 1) But he's really gone.

16:10.095 --> 16:14.141
After Connors and thurston ran, he knocked
out the bunker with one grenade.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.309
Now that's really somethin', huh?

16:17.811 --> 16:19.229
Yeah.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.441
(People grumbling)

16:25.235 --> 16:27.445
(Cop) We won't be long.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.960
On your feet. Come on.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.966
It's gonna be all over.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.636
He's got a gun!

16:52.304 --> 16:54.514
(Shouting)

16:54.764 --> 16:56.516
Take him down!

16:56.725 --> 17:00.187
I'm not resisting arrest!
I'm not resisting arrest!

17:00.270 --> 17:02.772
Stop hitting me, you sons of bitches!

17:02.856 --> 17:05.983
I'm not the one! I'm not the one!

17:06.067 --> 17:08.737
I'm not resisting arrest!

17:08.819 --> 17:11.656
Police brutality!
This is police brutality!

17:11.740 --> 17:14.159
I'm not resisting arrest!

17:14.242 --> 17:16.619
(Cop) Put him in the car!

17:16.703 --> 17:18.704
(Oswald) Let me go!

17:18.788 --> 17:22.209
(Cops, oswald shouting)

17:24.085 --> 17:27.088
(Siren blaring)

17:56.117 --> 17:58.328
(Martin Luther King)
We must, with positive action,

17:58.411 --> 18:00.664
remove those conditions of poverty...

18:00.789 --> 18:02.666
Insecurity and injustice...

18:02.749 --> 18:08.088
Which are the fertile soil in which the
seed of communism grows and develops.

18:08.171 --> 18:10.966
These are revolutionary times.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.426
All over the globe...

18:13.510 --> 18:18.139
Men are revolting against old systems
of exploitation and oppression.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.268
And out of the wombs of a frail world...

18:21.351 --> 18:25.522
New systems of justice
and equality are being born.

18:25.689 --> 18:28.608
The shirtless
and barefoot people of the land...

18:28.692 --> 18:31.027
Are rising up as never before.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.989
"I can kill you whenever I please."

18:36.116 --> 18:40.620
We in the west
must support these revolutions.

18:40.704 --> 18:42.038
"But not today."

18:42.122 --> 18:44.791
Because of comfort, complacency...

18:44.874 --> 18:50.213
A morbid fear of communism
and our proneness to adjust to injustice...

18:50.463 --> 18:52.549
The western nations that initiated...

18:52.632 --> 18:57.220
So much of the revolutionary spirit
of the modern world...

19:01.725 --> 19:06.563
Driven many to feel that only marxism
has the revolutionary spirit.

19:07.022 --> 19:09.399
The refore, communism is a judgement...

19:09.524 --> 19:12.902
Against our failure
to make democracy real...

19:12.986 --> 19:17.073
And follow through
on the revolutions that we initiated.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.201
No, no. Why'd you have to do that?

19:20.410 --> 19:22.078
To recapture the revolution...

19:29.878 --> 19:32.339
Why didn't you know
this was coming, Edgar?

19:32.881 --> 19:34.090
(Coughs)

19:34.758 --> 19:38.428
Last year the house was not smiling
on non eye-to-eye surveillance.

19:38.553 --> 19:39.596
So I stopped.

19:39.721 --> 19:45.143
We called Ramsey Clark to get a go-ahead
on tapping king's phone, but he refused.

19:45.226 --> 19:50.357
Our "behind the fence" operations believes
that king's ally, stokely Carmichael...

19:50.440 --> 19:54.027
Is recruitin' a negro army
to wage war on white america.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.530
Wouldn't you, if you were them?

19:57.614 --> 19:59.091
If this were only a civil rights issue...

19:59.115 --> 20:02.869
I'd vote for a king-Benjamin Spock
presidential ticket.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.871
But, after last night, it's not.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.207
You actually sound sad about it.

20:07.290 --> 20:10.543
I respect king. He's an extraordinary man.

20:10.627 --> 20:13.463
But now he's talking like a maoist.

20:13.546 --> 20:17.759
And if he convinces negroes
not to fight in Vietnam, we'll lose.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.887
And the first domino will have fallen.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.223
We must step up our efforts
to discredit him.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.975
Like your ridiculous suicide project?

20:26.059 --> 20:28.978
"There is but one way out for you"?

20:29.104 --> 20:32.065
That letter
attempting to drive king into despair...

20:32.148 --> 20:36.111
Only alerted him
to the level of our surveillance.

20:36.403 --> 20:40.115
We could create a film of him
with a woman other than his wife.

20:41.157 --> 20:46.079
Using existing footage, we could insert him
in a film we make of a woman -

20:46.162 --> 20:47.664
a white woman.

20:47.747 --> 20:52.001
The solution is more intense...
Than just dirty tricks.

20:55.505 --> 20:59.342
If you'll excuse us, the director
has a meeting at the white house.

20:59.467 --> 21:00.510
Sit down!

21:01.428 --> 21:05.932
You've enough plausible deniability
to last the rest of your nine lives.

21:09.686 --> 21:13.148
A sig force
can execute a wet-insert operation.

21:13.815 --> 21:17.444
One day, he and his immediate circle
are just found dead.

21:18.653 --> 21:20.029
Too many questions.

21:21.531 --> 21:26.453
Americans believe the south
is still fighting the civil war.

21:26.536 --> 21:32.208
We find ourselves a cracker patsy, and
the motives become very black and white.

21:32.542 --> 21:33.877
Another patsy.

21:35.003 --> 21:37.797
Should we advise the president?

21:37.881 --> 21:42.343
I work very hard to keep any president
from knowing I even exist.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.722
Who will you order to do it?

21:49.976 --> 21:52.061
I'll do it myself.

21:52.562 --> 21:55.315
I have too much respect for the man.

21:58.568 --> 22:00.737
(King) The nation is sick.

22:02.405 --> 22:06.659
Trouble is in the land,
confusion all around.

22:06.743 --> 22:09.662
That's a strange statement.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.664
But I know, somehow...

22:11.748 --> 22:14.834
That only when it is dark enough...

22:14.918 --> 22:17.337
Can you see the stars.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.423
And I see god working...

22:20.507 --> 22:23.885
In this period of
the twentieth century...

22:26.763 --> 22:28.097
In a way...

22:29.182 --> 22:34.020
That men, in some strange way,
are responding.

22:34.103 --> 22:37.690
Something is happening in our world.

22:37.774 --> 22:40.610
The masses of people are rising up.

22:42.529 --> 22:46.032
And wherever they are assembled today...

22:46.115 --> 22:50.453
Whether they are in
Johannesburg, South Africa, '...

22:50.578 --> 22:52.789
Nairobi, Ken ya, ' Accra, Ghana, '...

22:52.914 --> 22:55.124
New York City, ' Atlanta, Georgia, '...

22:55.416 --> 22:58.461
Jackson, Mississippi
or Memphis, Tennessee...

22:58.586 --> 23:02.465
The cry is always the same:
"We want to be free!"

23:02.549 --> 23:04.133
(People cheering)

23:08.137 --> 23:09.764
(Footsteps approaching)

23:15.061 --> 23:17.146
Raul.

23:17.772 --> 23:21.985
- I got the binoculars you sent me out for.
- Just put 'em down by your clothes.

23:22.110 --> 23:26.406
I heard dr king's stayin'
at the Lorraine motel right behind here.

23:26.489 --> 23:29.742
Our gun buyer's coming by
to look at the rifle.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.745
Well, I gave it to you this mornin'.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.581
Ihaveit

23:35.123 --> 23:37.667
look, uh, three's a crowd.

23:40.295 --> 23:44.340
Here's a coupla hundred. Go to a movie
or something. Come back in a few hours.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.676
Leave the mustang. I'll need it later.

24:04.027 --> 24:07.363
(King's voice)
Lord, I don't know what will happen now.

24:07.488 --> 24:10.533
We've got some difficult days ahead.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.453
But it really doesn't matter to me now.

24:13.536 --> 24:15.705
Because I've been to the mountaintop.

24:15.830 --> 24:17.290
(People cheering)

24:17.373 --> 24:19.709
And I don't mind.

24:21.878 --> 24:26.633
Like anybody, I would
like to live a long life.

24:26.716 --> 24:30.637
Longevity has its place.

24:30.720 --> 24:34.057
But I'm not concerned about that now.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.851
I just want to do god's will.

24:37.894 --> 24:41.564
And he's allowed me
to go up to the mountain.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.900
And I've looked over.

24:44.025 --> 24:45.818
And I've seen...

24:46.527 --> 24:48.029
The promised land.

24:48.905 --> 24:51.407
Imay not get there with you.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.910
But I want you to know tonight...

24:53.993 --> 24:58.081
That we, as a people,
will get to the promised land!

24:58.164 --> 24:59.374
(Cheering)

25:03.586 --> 25:06.589
So I'm happy tonight.
I'm not worried about anything!

25:06.714 --> 25:09.008
I'm not fearing any man!

25:09.092 --> 25:12.845
Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the lord!

25:12.929 --> 25:15.598
(Gunshot echoing)

25:20.603 --> 25:22.438
(Television)

25:34.117 --> 25:38.454
Declarations of states of emergency
in several cities.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.957
In Washington, DC...

25:41.040 --> 25:43.459
(TV continues)

25:45.044 --> 25:49.048
New York state senator Robert f Kennedy
has made an appeal for calm.

25:49.132 --> 25:54.762
(Kennedy) I can also feel, in my own heart,
the same kind of feeling.

25:56.139 --> 25:58.808
I had a member of my family killed.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.936
But he was killed by a white man.

26:03.479 --> 26:06.649
My favourite poet was aeschylus.

26:06.816 --> 26:08.818
And he once wrote...

26:11.821 --> 26:15.116
"Even in our sleep,
pain which cannot forget...

26:16.492 --> 26:18.995
Falls drop by drop upon the heart...

26:19.787 --> 26:22.749
Until in our own despair...

26:22.832 --> 26:26.085
Against our own will comes wisdom...

26:26.169 --> 26:28.129
Through the awful grace of god."

26:39.015 --> 26:41.184
(Voice on tape)

26:44.687 --> 26:47.648
(Siren blaring in distance)

26:54.280 --> 26:55.490
All right, gentlemen.

26:55.573 --> 26:58.534
Let's make this short
so we can all go home for Christmas.

26:59.494 --> 27:01.412
Domestic unrest operations?

27:01.496 --> 27:04.665
The Anita hill thing
has lost steam since October.

27:04.749 --> 27:07.251
Well, let it go. We played it right.

27:07.335 --> 27:11.172
Unfounded allegations
will be flying around in no time. La?

27:11.255 --> 27:14.050
The Rodney king trial's been moved
to simi valley, as you instructed.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.301
(Beeping)

27:17.762 --> 27:20.848
- Call back.
- Internationally, Bosnia-Herzegovina...

27:20.932 --> 27:24.811
Is set for a February vote
on independence from yugoslavia.

27:24.894 --> 27:27.188
America couldn't care less.

27:27.271 --> 27:30.024
I'm working on next month's
Oscar nominations.

27:30.107 --> 27:33.236
- Any preference?
- I couldn't care less.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.738
But I don't want the bills
to win the super bowl.

27:35.822 --> 27:38.241
As long as I'm alive, that doesn't happen.

27:38.324 --> 27:41.077
Could be tough, sir.
Buffalo wants it bad.

27:41.285 --> 27:43.287
So did the Soviets in '80.

27:43.371 --> 27:45.373
You rigged the olympic hockey game?

27:45.456 --> 27:48.543
What's the matter?
Don't you believe in miracles?

27:48.626 --> 27:53.172
The boss gave the Russian goaltender a
little pre-game good-luck pat on the back.

27:53.256 --> 27:56.175
Unseen novocain needle
on a bogus wedding ring.

27:56.259 --> 27:58.719
Goalie's a little slow on the stick side.

27:58.803 --> 28:00.888
Four-three, home team.

28:01.264 --> 28:03.057
Payback's a bitch, Ivan.

28:03.724 --> 28:07.478
- Well, gentlemen, if that'll be all...
- One thing internally, sir.

28:07.562 --> 28:13.276
That "spooky" kid who talked his way into
opening the x-files, he feels like trouble.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.487
He's mine to keep an eye on.

28:16.571 --> 28:17.822
(Beeping)

28:22.285 --> 28:24.579
Gorbachev has just resigned.

28:27.123 --> 28:29.667
There's no more enemies.

28:39.802 --> 28:40.887
Merry Christmas.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.684
Merry Christmas.

28:53.441 --> 28:55.651
If you don't have any plans, sir...

28:57.194 --> 29:00.489
We're all getting together
with our families out in Virginia.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.283
You're more than welcome to...

29:02.366 --> 29:04.243
Oh. Well.

29:07.538 --> 29:09.790
I have to, uh, see some, uh...

29:11.000 --> 29:12.084
Some family.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.409
(Keyboard clicking)

29:54.543 --> 29:58.172
(Andy Williams)
It's the most wonderful time of the year

30:00.466 --> 30:03.177
with the kids jingle-belling

30:03.260 --> 30:07.598
and everyone telling you "be of good cheer"

30:07.682 --> 30:12.186
it's the most wonderful time of the year

30:13.771 --> 30:18.651
it's the hap-happiest season of all

30:20.403 --> 30:23.781
with those holiday greetings
and gay, happy feelings

30:23.864 --> 30:26.742
when friends come to call

30:26.826 --> 30:31.163
it's the hap-happiest season of all

31:14.165 --> 31:16.375
(Phone ringing)

31:16.709 --> 31:17.793
Yeah?

31:17.877 --> 31:21.672
(Man) You'll never believe
what we just got for Christmas.

31:31.640 --> 31:35.227
The craft matches the dimensions
of a vehicle spotted over Hanoi...

31:35.311 --> 31:40.399
When I was in Vietnam with the company,
that the marines couldn't shoot down.

31:40.483 --> 31:42.526
- Occupant?
- Critical.

31:42.610 --> 31:44.945
Timing couldn't be worse.

31:45.029 --> 31:48.074
The roswell story we concocted
was gathering momentum.

31:48.157 --> 31:51.160
Had them all looking
in the wrong direction.

31:51.243 --> 31:54.080
- With luck we'll get away with it.
- No luck tonight.

31:54.163 --> 31:57.625
Our spy planes confirm
the Russians tracked entry

31:57.708 --> 31:59.794
and have pinpointed touchdown.

31:59.877 --> 32:03.172
Haven't you heard?
There are no Russians anymore.

32:03.255 --> 32:08.302
Even if they're in the midst of ruin, the
kgb won't ignore an event of this magnitude.

32:08.385 --> 32:11.806
Nor the Chinese, nor the Germans,
nor the British...

32:11.889 --> 32:16.519
Or anyone with the capability
of discovering what happened here.

32:16.602 --> 32:21.273
I'm certain each of them
has operatives advancing on us right now.

32:31.951 --> 32:36.205
How many historic events have only
the two of us witnessed together?

32:37.915 --> 32:41.460
How often did we make or change history?

32:43.254 --> 32:45.589
And our names can never...

32:45.673 --> 32:48.592
Grace any pages of record.

32:48.843 --> 32:51.887
No monument will ever bear our image.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.890
And yet, once again, tonight...

32:55.766 --> 32:59.812
The course of human history
will be set by two unknown men...

33:00.229 --> 33:02.815
Standing in the shadows.

33:15.452 --> 33:19.165
A living ebe could advance
bill mulder's project by decades.

33:19.248 --> 33:25.796
Security council resolution 1013 states
any country capturing such an entity...

33:25.880 --> 33:29.967
Is responsible
for its immediate extermination.

33:33.804 --> 33:36.599
I'm the liar. You're the killer.

33:37.266 --> 33:41.228
Your lies have killed more men in a day
than I have in a lifetime.

33:41.312 --> 33:43.230
I've never killed anybody.

33:43.314 --> 33:45.482
Maybe I'm not the liar.

33:45.566 --> 33:50.321
I have a chance to go a lifetime
without killing anybody or any thing.

33:50.404 --> 33:53.532
With all of our work
in the past 30 years, all of our victories,

33:53.616 --> 33:56.076
if the world were to see this...

33:56.911 --> 34:00.414
It would destroy all we have gained
in a few hours.

34:02.124 --> 34:05.461
Tonight, we have a new...

34:06.337 --> 34:07.630
Enemy.

34:21.518 --> 34:22.603
Heads.

34:29.568 --> 34:30.569
Go ahead.

34:31.654 --> 34:33.197
Make history.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.595
(Second gunshot)

36:04.079 --> 36:08.417
(Frohike) At that point, your work
was getting attention from the top floor.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.502
That's why you were brought in.

36:21.388 --> 36:25.017
(Man 1) Agent Scully, thank you
for coming on such short notice.

36:25.100 --> 36:28.354
(Man 2) Are you familiar
with agent fox mulder?

36:28.437 --> 36:30.189
Yes, I am.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.942
- How so?
- By reputation.

36:34.193 --> 36:37.613
Um, he's an Oxford-educated psychologist...

36:37.696 --> 36:43.702
Who wrote a monograph on serial killers
that helped to catch monty propps in 1988.

36:43.786 --> 36:48.082
Generally thought of as the best analyst
in the violent crimes section.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.959
He had a nickname at the academy.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.380
Spooky mulder.

36:55.422 --> 36:59.635
Agent mulder has developed
a consuming devotion...

36:59.760 --> 37:02.805
To a project outside
the bureau mainstream.

37:02.930 --> 37:05.224
Are you familiar with the x-files?

37:05.307 --> 37:06.308
(Knocking)

37:06.392 --> 37:10.479
Sorry. Nobody down here
but the FBI's most unwanted.

37:10.604 --> 37:14.483
Agent mulder. I'm Dana Scully.
I've been assigned to work with you.

37:14.566 --> 37:18.237
Oh, isn't it nice
to be suddenly so highly regarded?

37:18.320 --> 37:21.657
Who did you tick off
to get stuck with this detail?

37:21.740 --> 37:24.410
I'm looking fon/vard to working with you.

37:24.493 --> 37:26.745
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Really?

37:26.829 --> 37:31.750
I was under the impression
that you were sent to spy on me.

37:31.834 --> 37:34.253
(Frohike) Henry David Thoreau wrote...

37:34.336 --> 37:38.090
"The mass of men
lead lives of quiet desperation."

37:38.173 --> 37:40.426
His life has been anything but quiet.

37:40.509 --> 37:43.095
Yet, lbelieve, nothing but desperate.

37:43.178 --> 37:45.347
He's the most dangerous man alive.

37:45.431 --> 37:47.683
Not because he believes in his actions...

37:47.808 --> 37:51.770
But because he believes these actions
are all which life allows him.

37:51.854 --> 37:55.441
And yet, the only person
that can never escape him...

37:55.524 --> 37:57.317
Is himself.

38:19.381 --> 38:22.217
- (Woman) Pivotal publishing.
- Walden roth, please.

38:22.342 --> 38:24.720
- (Woman) One moment.
- Walden roth.

38:24.803 --> 38:28.807
Oh, mr roth, hello.
Uh, this is Raul bloodworth...

38:28.891 --> 38:32.144
Author of second chance:
A Jack colquitt adventure.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.146
Yes, of course, mr bloodworth.

38:34.229 --> 38:36.899
What an active imagination!
Alien assassinations!

38:37.191 --> 38:40.402
Is it too much?
I mean, is my imagination too active?

38:40.486 --> 38:43.238
No, I love it.
As I've expressed in the letter...

38:43.363 --> 38:46.825
I wish to serialise your novel
in our publication, Roman a' clef.

38:46.909 --> 38:50.078
Many authors receive
their first printing in our publications.

38:50.204 --> 38:52.414
(Laughing) That's great.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.750
Um, I had an idea about the artwork.

38:54.833 --> 38:58.587
I thought it could have a kind of
Tom Clancy-ish kind of look...

38:58.670 --> 39:00.964
Great! That's why we work
with young writers.

39:01.048 --> 39:03.926
But you'll have to relinquish some control.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.513
Of course. Of course.

39:07.596 --> 39:09.348
After all, it is our publication.

39:09.431 --> 39:12.476
And I can assure you,
we'll handle it with the utmost respect.

39:12.559 --> 39:17.272
No, no, no. I'm sure you will.
I'm... I'm just excited.

39:17.356 --> 39:20.025
Understandable.
Do you have an agent or attorney?

39:20.108 --> 39:21.610
- No.
- That's fine.

39:21.693 --> 39:25.364
It's a minimum agreement of $2500,
and you'll save yourself ten percent.

39:25.447 --> 39:28.283
Well, that's fine, that's fine. Anything.

39:28.408 --> 39:30.786
When do you plan to publish the story?

39:30.911 --> 39:35.290
"Roman a' clef" will be on the newsstands
the morning of November 12th.

39:40.629 --> 39:42.589
(Bell dings)

40:22.796 --> 40:25.507
(Man) Hey, buddy, you can't park there!

40:28.176 --> 40:31.805
Excuse me, sir. Have you got
this week's issue of Roman a' clef?

40:39.354 --> 40:41.356
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

40:55.203 --> 40:58.540
This isn't the ending that I wrote.
It's all wrong.

40:58.999 --> 41:02.544
If you're gonna read it,
I gotta ask you to buy it.

41:02.711 --> 41:07.716
Of course, I don't know why
anybody would wanna buy that sort of crap.

41:21.396 --> 41:22.564
That be it?

41:24.900 --> 41:26.818
Pack of morleys.

41:54.721 --> 41:57.766
Life is like a box of chocolates.

41:59.017 --> 42:03.021
A cheap, thoughtless, perfunctory gift
that nobody ever asks for.

42:03.105 --> 42:06.692
Unreturnable because all you get back
is another box of chocolates.

42:06.775 --> 42:10.612
So you're stuck with this undefinable
whipped-mint crap...

42:10.696 --> 42:14.783
That you mindlessly wolf down
when there's nothing else left to eat.

42:14.908 --> 42:17.786
Sure, once in a while
there's a peanut-butter cup...

42:17.911 --> 42:20.622
Or an English toffee...

42:20.747 --> 42:24.793
But they're gone too fast
and the taste is fleeting.

42:26.378 --> 42:28.797
So you end up with nothing but...

42:28.922 --> 42:31.133
Broken bits filled
with hardened jelly...

42:31.216 --> 42:33.468
And teeth-shattering nuts.

42:33.593 --> 42:37.472
If you're desperate enough to eat those,
all you've got left is a...

42:37.556 --> 42:42.477
Is an empty box
filled with useless brown-paper wrappers.

43:11.590 --> 43:14.092
(Frohike) This is based
only on a story I read...

43:14.176 --> 43:17.262
In one of my weekly subscriptions
that rang a few bells.

43:17.345 --> 43:21.099
I'll check on a private hacker source
who's been working on a few leads...

43:21.183 --> 43:23.685
That could produce definitive proof.

43:23.769 --> 43:25.312
And then we'll have him nailed.

43:31.359 --> 43:33.361
I can kill you whenever I please.

43:49.211 --> 43:50.962
But not today.

44:21.159 --> 44:22.869
Subtitles by visiontext

44:42.180 --> 44:43.640
(Child) I made this.
