02:38.767 --> 02:41.944
I was watching that
TV show last night.

02:41.944 --> 02:45.513
- That guy won a million dollars.
- How?

02:45.513 --> 02:48.603
Just general knowledge questions.

02:48.603 --> 02:52.737
Maybe you should try it.
You went to college and stuff.

02:52.737 --> 02:56.350
You're not gonna need a million
dollars when you're old.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.094
Hey, Fan.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.924
What would you do
with a million dollars?

03:05.924 --> 03:11.365
- I would build a community pool.
- Oh.

08:10.098 --> 08:13.101
Can I leave earlier tomorrow?

08:13.101 --> 08:16.713
- At what time?
- 1:30 P.M.

08:16.713 --> 08:20.238
- Why?
- I have a doctor's appointment.

08:20.238 --> 08:24.199
Of course you can.
- Thank you.

08:28.116 --> 08:31.249
Want me to see if he has
a friend he can bring?

08:31.249 --> 08:32.729
We could go
on a blind double date?

08:32.729 --> 08:35.775
- No.
- You sure?

08:35.775 --> 08:38.822
I think I would hate
a blind date.

08:38.822 --> 08:41.869
You don't know anything
about him, right?

08:41.869 --> 08:43.914
Nothing.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.744
Where is he taking you?

08:47.744 --> 08:49.485
It's a blind date,

08:49.485 --> 08:52.619
so we agreed upon
a specific location.

08:52.619 --> 08:55.143
We're going to
a Mexican restaurant.

08:55.143 --> 08:59.234
If it all goes well, eventually
we'll even move in together.

09:01.149 --> 09:03.281
Then we can share the rent.

09:03.281 --> 09:06.154
Where will you
put your mom?

09:06.154 --> 09:07.677
I don't know.
I'll just get her an extra bed

09:07.677 --> 09:10.027
and put it somewhere, I guess.

09:11.899 --> 09:14.162
Do you have an extra bed?

09:14.162 --> 09:17.644
No, I only have
one single bed.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.095
Hello?

09:34.095 --> 09:37.185
Having a single bed
is very wrong,

09:37.185 --> 09:39.230
according to
The Laws Of Attraction,

09:39.230 --> 09:42.756
because it doesn't invite
the possibility of company.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.065
You should be sleeping
in a double bed,

09:48.065 --> 09:49.893
even if you're sleeping alone.

09:49.893 --> 09:53.462
I can't fit a double bed
in my bedroom.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.815
Okay, well, I'm gonna finish
the chapter

09:58.815 --> 10:00.730
and then go to sleep.

10:00.730 --> 10:03.603
- Good night, Donya.
- Good night, Joanna.

10:19.009 --> 10:21.577
I have an appointment
with Dr. Anthony.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.274
Your name?

10:23.274 --> 10:26.843
Well, the appointment
is not in my name.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.977
It's in the name
of Salim Dabiri.

10:29.977 --> 10:32.414
He made the appointment for you?

10:32.414 --> 10:34.024
No.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.809
Do you have
an appointment card?

10:35.809 --> 10:37.332
Mm-hmm.

10:41.510 --> 10:44.992
But this is an appointment
specifically for Mr. Dabiri.

10:44.992 --> 10:49.910
I know, but he couldn't make it,
so he gave it to me.

10:49.910 --> 10:53.130
I don't think that's possible.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.567
Why?

10:55.567 --> 10:57.831
Well, if someone can't make
their appointment slot

10:57.831 --> 10:59.702
they need to
call us and cancel.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.095
Then, we would allocate
the appointment

11:01.095 --> 11:02.792
to another patient.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.402
I'm another patient.

11:04.402 --> 11:05.969
Yes, I understand,

11:05.969 --> 11:08.058
but there are other patients
of Dr. Anthony's

11:08.058 --> 11:09.407
that would be given
the appointment

11:09.407 --> 11:11.192
if there's been
a cancellation.

11:19.287 --> 11:20.854
Give me a moment.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.093
To be honest with you,
this isn't really

11:43.093 --> 11:45.226
the way things work.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.927
It's not like a movie ticket

11:50.927 --> 11:54.365
where if you can't get
to the 3:15 showing,

11:54.365 --> 11:57.586
you give the ticket
to your friend.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.588
Um...

11:59.588 --> 12:01.590
It's not like that
with a doctor's appointment,

12:01.590 --> 12:04.811
and Salim knows that very well.

12:08.510 --> 12:13.036
I'm here to ask for something
to help me sleep.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.433
All right, well...

12:22.263 --> 12:23.438
Um...

12:24.874 --> 12:28.051
Are you--
Do you live in Fremont?

12:29.661 --> 12:32.360
And are you also from
Afghanistan?

12:32.360 --> 12:34.797
Yes, I am.

12:34.797 --> 12:37.278
On the Special Immigration Visa?

12:37.278 --> 12:40.934
Yes, I was a translator
in Afghanistan.

12:40.934 --> 12:43.806
Well...
the way it works,

12:43.806 --> 12:46.853
we have a certain number
of appointments

12:46.853 --> 12:52.032
for, uh, self-payers
or, uh, the insured.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.947
Basically,
our paying customers.

12:53.947 --> 12:57.820
And then I have a few slots
that I do pro bono.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.301
Those spots are at a premium,

13:00.301 --> 13:03.391
and so we have to follow
the protocol

13:03.391 --> 13:06.220
to make sure that it's fair
for everyone.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.178
So, the people
who have been waiting,

13:08.178 --> 13:09.919
or the people that
are already in the system,

13:09.919 --> 13:12.487
- get to see--
- I'm here now.

13:14.184 --> 13:16.839
Well, I can see that I--

13:16.839 --> 13:18.406
Yeah, I understand
you're here now,

13:18.406 --> 13:20.190
but there is a protocol

13:20.190 --> 13:23.454
that we need to follow
to make this system work.

13:23.454 --> 13:25.630
I'm not leaving.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.510
Okay.

13:35.510 --> 13:38.208
Um, well...

13:43.387 --> 13:46.129
Let me just get some general
information from you, then.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.001
Um... name?

13:49.872 --> 13:51.743
Donya Massoudi.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.312
Uh, date and place of birth?

13:56.618 --> 13:59.839
Thirteenth, June, 1996.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.624
Kabul, Afghanistan.

14:02.624 --> 14:07.150
And how long have you been here
in the United States?

14:07.150 --> 14:09.674
Eight months.

14:09.674 --> 14:12.677
And, um, did you work as
a translator for the government,

14:12.677 --> 14:15.942
or was that private sector?

14:15.942 --> 14:18.205
For the United States Army.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.120
How long did you do that for?

14:20.120 --> 14:23.819
I just want sleeping pills.

14:23.819 --> 14:26.387
- How's your general health?
- Good.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.477
You have nightmares?

14:29.477 --> 14:32.001
Not so much.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.612
I can't sleep well.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.879
Do you have a lot of thoughts
when you go to bed?

14:42.098 --> 14:43.447
Mm-mmm.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.466
You should just
go see my palm reader.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.904
She never has a waiting list.

15:04.904 --> 15:09.734
She reads and understands people
better than any psychiatrist.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.562
You know what she told me?

15:11.562 --> 15:14.217
She said that
the reason I overeat

15:14.217 --> 15:18.613
is because I don't wanna be like
my mom, who's skinny.

15:18.613 --> 15:21.268
If that's not pure psychology,

15:21.268 --> 15:23.531
I don't know what is.

15:25.881 --> 15:27.709
She can also clean karmas.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.894
I'm gonna go
and get some coffee.

15:43.420 --> 15:47.381
I think a fun working
environment is essential.

15:47.381 --> 15:49.949
I love coming in to work.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.564
You know...

15:56.564 --> 15:59.349
my father opened
this factory many years ago.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.048
And I used
to come with him

16:02.048 --> 16:04.006
when I was
a little kid.

16:04.006 --> 16:06.008
But then he stopped
bringing me

16:06.008 --> 16:09.272
because I ate all
the cookies all the time.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.624
I love the cookies.

16:15.322 --> 16:16.976
I ate so many.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.456
It was so much fun.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.069
Okay.
I'll see you later.

16:41.174 --> 16:42.827
- TV in foreign language]

18:06.346 --> 18:08.304
Go ahead,
take a seat.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.227
Okay, let's see
what we have here.

18:21.491 --> 18:25.191
Tell me a bit about
the situation in Afghanistan

18:25.191 --> 18:27.410
before you left to come here.

18:35.375 --> 18:38.334
Did you live with your parents,
for instance?

18:39.074 --> 18:40.162
Mm-hmm.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.166
Do you have, uh,
pictures of your family

18:44.166 --> 18:46.125
you can show me?

18:48.953 --> 18:52.392
Do you have any family members
in America?

18:52.392 --> 18:54.176
No.

18:54.176 --> 18:57.092
They're all in Afghanistan?

18:57.092 --> 18:58.180
Mm-hmm.

19:00.443 --> 19:03.838
You must miss them very much,
I'm sure.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.887
Was your family ever threatened?

19:11.802 --> 19:14.153
They told them they would come
after my little brother

19:14.153 --> 19:16.285
if I don't come back.

19:16.285 --> 19:19.767
Has any harm been done
to your family,

19:19.767 --> 19:21.856
by that I mean physical harm?

19:22.944 --> 19:24.075
No.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.474
When you were there,
was your family unhappy

19:31.474 --> 19:33.433
about what you were doing?

19:33.433 --> 19:35.435
I only did the work
for the money

19:35.435 --> 19:38.177
and getting a visa to come here.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.917
Nothing else.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.923
Do you feel guilty?

19:50.841 --> 19:53.409
How do you, uh,
like it here?

19:58.284 --> 20:01.156
Is America what you thought
it would be?

20:03.463 --> 20:05.334
I didn't think how it would be.

20:07.031 --> 20:09.686
I didn't even think
about America.

20:09.686 --> 20:13.212
I just wanted
to get out of there.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.518
I would have gone to

20:15.518 --> 20:18.826
Germany, France, England,

20:18.826 --> 20:23.570
El Salvador, or anywhere.

20:26.007 --> 20:28.662
There weren't many women
that were doing

20:28.662 --> 20:30.968
translation work
like you were doing.

20:30.968 --> 20:34.407
In that sense, uh,
you're sort of a pioneer,

20:34.407 --> 20:37.845
so your family must
be proud of that.

20:37.845 --> 20:40.804
I left,
but they are still there.

20:40.804 --> 20:42.719
They have to hear people
talk to them

20:42.719 --> 20:46.332
about raising a daughter
who was a traitor.

20:46.332 --> 20:50.074
Do you think you are a traitor?

20:52.076 --> 20:54.253
I don't spend much time thinking.

20:55.906 --> 20:56.907
Why?

20:58.126 --> 20:59.997
Too busy with my social life.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.176
Hmm.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.343
I think I'm gonna stop
with the blind dates.

23:08.343 --> 23:10.476
Why?

23:11.651 --> 23:13.304
It's not...
working out.

23:13.304 --> 23:14.741
I'm not meeting anybody.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.048
You don't need anybody.

23:18.048 --> 23:20.747
You need someone special.

23:23.837 --> 23:26.883
Next time you answer like
a fortune cookie, I'll eat you.

23:26.883 --> 23:28.581
It happened once.

23:28.581 --> 23:31.671
No, it's happened
a lot of times.

23:33.368 --> 23:35.414
It hurts.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.459
You have to keep meeting people.

23:40.723 --> 23:43.813
There is this other guy,
a son of my mom's friend.

23:43.813 --> 23:46.903
He's recently divorced and
she wants to set me up with him.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.253
Maybe I'll go.

24:47.790 --> 24:51.228
Did you accompany
the Army on missions?

24:51.228 --> 24:55.798
No, I translated
in U.S. Army bases

24:55.798 --> 25:00.411
when instruction were being
given to the Afghan soldiers

25:00.411 --> 25:05.068
on how to use
new equipment and arms.

25:11.031 --> 25:13.555
Did you see much fighting,
Donya?

25:13.555 --> 25:16.515
Several bases I worked with

25:16.515 --> 25:19.518
were attacked
in different times...

25:21.128 --> 25:24.348
and that's fighting I saw.

25:26.742 --> 25:29.440
How did you leave Afghanistan?

25:29.440 --> 25:33.009
On one of the evacuation flights

25:34.533 --> 25:37.057
after Taliban return.

25:39.929 --> 25:42.628
But I know I'm very lucky.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.586
How do you mean?

25:44.586 --> 25:46.936
One translator I worked with

25:46.936 --> 25:51.724
was killed almost immediately
after he stopped working

25:51.724 --> 25:53.900
for the U.S. Army.

25:53.900 --> 25:58.644
He was waiting for his paper
to come over here.

26:00.689 --> 26:02.909
One of my friends,

26:02.909 --> 26:05.781
Payam, he was also translator.

26:08.828 --> 26:12.179
He couldn't make it
to the evacuation flights.

26:14.877 --> 26:18.533
I know I'm lucky,
and I know they're unlucky.

26:22.798 --> 26:26.236
I've met with
many former translators

26:26.236 --> 26:31.067
and they have different reasons
for doing what they did.

26:33.374 --> 26:36.638
But in most cases,

26:36.638 --> 26:41.687
they suffered from
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

26:45.255 --> 26:48.824
They're left feeling like maybe
in some way they're responsible.

26:50.434 --> 26:52.741
And so, they're haunted

26:54.003 --> 26:56.571
by bad thoughts, nightmares.

26:58.486 --> 27:00.967
And they feel
that they can't trust others,

27:00.967 --> 27:04.579
so they...
isolate themselves.

27:06.189 --> 27:08.235
Maybe it's just a sense of guilt

27:10.063 --> 27:12.152
that prevents them
from talking to others

27:12.152 --> 27:16.199
and getting the help that
they really desperately need.

27:18.549 --> 27:22.423
Do you know what Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder is?

27:23.772 --> 27:25.556
I don't suffer from it.

27:25.556 --> 27:28.037
I just have problem with sleep.

27:28.037 --> 27:30.910
If I had some sleeping pills,

27:30.910 --> 27:33.956
my problems would go away.

27:52.758 --> 27:56.979
I-I chose my specialization
for a reason.

27:58.807 --> 28:03.159
I admire people like you
who have stories to tell

28:03.159 --> 28:06.597
of courage and displacement.

28:08.208 --> 28:11.690
Guess which immigrant hero
I love the most?

28:19.088 --> 28:20.176
White Fang.

28:21.395 --> 28:22.875
The dog?

28:22.875 --> 28:24.311
No, he's not a dog.

28:24.311 --> 28:26.313
He's-he's one-quarter dog.

28:26.313 --> 28:29.185
He's three-quarters wolf.

28:31.753 --> 28:34.669
I will give you a prescription
for the sleeping pills,

28:34.669 --> 28:38.455
but I think it's important that
we use these sessions

28:38.455 --> 28:41.110
to talk about
some of these issues.

28:48.465 --> 28:52.731
"Your genuine talent
will find its way to success."

28:56.125 --> 28:59.128
"Your financial outlook
is great at this time."

29:04.177 --> 29:05.700
That's nonsense.

29:17.190 --> 29:19.583
She's dead.

29:22.630 --> 29:26.677
But she was also getting too old
to write about the future.

29:29.332 --> 29:32.292
We are looking for someone else
to replace her.

29:34.555 --> 29:37.253
- Wouldn't you be interested?
- Mm-hmm.

30:14.638 --> 30:18.512
Fortune messages
are a responsibility.

30:20.035 --> 30:22.733
Consciously,
or unconsciously,

30:22.733 --> 30:26.825
they are going to act
on the flux of things.

30:28.217 --> 30:30.393
They shouldn't
be too lucky.

30:30.393 --> 30:33.135
They shouldn't be
too unlucky.

30:33.135 --> 30:36.182
They shouldn't
be too original.

30:36.182 --> 30:39.272
They shouldn't be
too obvious.

30:39.272 --> 30:41.491
They shouldn't
be too short.

30:41.491 --> 30:45.104
They shouldn't be
too long and so on.

30:45.104 --> 30:46.845
You get the point?

30:46.845 --> 30:48.672
I think so.

30:48.672 --> 30:53.416
The point is, my father and I
built our factory

30:53.416 --> 30:57.029
according to
a very ancient quote,

30:57.029 --> 31:00.641
"Virtue stands
in the middle."

31:00.641 --> 31:02.643
You know?

31:02.643 --> 31:04.514
I love quotes
very much.

31:09.780 --> 31:13.828
This is a small gift
that I personally prepared

31:13.828 --> 31:17.963
to welcome you
to your new adventure.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.138
Thank you.

31:20.052 --> 31:21.705
Open it.

31:50.212 --> 31:52.649
It is a head massager.

31:53.737 --> 31:55.565
I use it, too.

31:55.565 --> 31:59.874
It helps me
to gather creative ideas.

31:59.874 --> 32:02.181
Try it.

32:07.273 --> 32:10.015
You run it through your head,
down to your scalp.

32:21.243 --> 32:25.508
It's a lot more fun
if someone else does it for you.

32:25.508 --> 32:27.554
I would offer
to do it,

32:27.554 --> 32:29.773
but it is inappropriate.

32:29.773 --> 32:31.471
Thank you.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.824
I've been in this business
for ages.

32:36.824 --> 32:40.567
I've seen message writers
come and go,

32:40.567 --> 32:42.308
and I learned
one thing.

32:44.179 --> 32:46.181
The ones who stay

32:46.181 --> 32:49.402
are the ones who know
how to talk about love.

32:50.664 --> 32:52.405
And the ones
who are best

32:52.405 --> 32:54.581
at talking about love

32:54.581 --> 32:57.105
are the ones
who love themselves.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.848
Do you love
yourself?

33:00.848 --> 33:02.371
Yes.

33:02.371 --> 33:04.983
Then you should
say it out loud.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.333
- Okay.
- Now.

33:07.333 --> 33:11.206
- I love myself.
- Good.

34:04.564 --> 34:07.741
"The fortune you seek is
in another cookie."

34:08.742 --> 34:10.396
Wise, right?

34:10.396 --> 34:13.094
Yes, very.

34:18.882 --> 34:20.493
Does somebody check
what you write

34:20.493 --> 34:23.016
or can you write
whatever you want?

34:23.016 --> 34:25.411
I can write what I want.

34:25.411 --> 34:28.978
Then maybe you can use
this, uh, opportunity

34:28.978 --> 34:32.373
as an exercise of sorts.

34:32.373 --> 34:35.072
Say, if there's something
that's making you

34:35.072 --> 34:38.250
happy or sad,

34:38.250 --> 34:43.123
you can unburden yourself
by jotting it down on paper.

34:43.123 --> 34:46.170
Of course, obviously,
there's, uh,

34:46.170 --> 34:49.913
there's the fact that you gotta
make it fortune-cookie-friendly

34:49.913 --> 34:52.002
when you condense it
down to one line,

34:52.002 --> 34:55.658
but, um, that can
certainly be done.

34:58.008 --> 35:02.012
Perhaps it would make the whole
thing more fulfilling for you.

37:48.004 --> 37:49.571
How's your literary
production going?

37:49.571 --> 37:51.443
Well.

37:53.749 --> 37:54.881
Bad.

37:54.881 --> 37:57.710
It's time to go, anyway.

37:59.364 --> 38:00.974
I'm coming.

38:16.772 --> 38:18.426
Where's your mom?

38:18.426 --> 38:21.255
She's off taking photographs
in the wilderness somewhere.

38:21.255 --> 38:23.301
She'll be back
in a couple of days.

38:48.978 --> 38:52.068
♪ Just another diamond day

38:52.068 --> 38:55.158
♪ Just a blade of grass

38:55.158 --> 38:58.466
♪ Just another bale of hay

38:58.466 --> 39:01.687
♪ In the horses path

39:14.352 --> 39:17.746
♪ Just another field
to plough ♪

39:17.746 --> 39:20.793
♪ Just a grain of wheat

39:20.793 --> 39:24.144
♪ Just a sack of seed to sow

39:24.144 --> 39:27.277
♪ And the children eat

39:40.247 --> 39:43.293
♪ Just another life to live

39:43.293 --> 39:46.427

39:46.427 --> 39:49.778
♪ Just another love to give

39:49.778 --> 39:52.520
♪ And a diamond day

40:47.314 --> 40:50.099
I've been working
on a little project.

40:53.668 --> 40:57.237
I wrote some, uh, messages

40:57.237 --> 41:00.806
of the type that you might find
in a cookie.

41:00.806 --> 41:02.721
Fortunes.

41:36.929 --> 41:39.366
Of course,
I don't have the technology

41:39.366 --> 41:42.151
or the know-how to do this
on a computer,

41:42.151 --> 41:45.938
so what I had to do was
get a sheet of paper

41:45.938 --> 41:48.723
and a ruler and a pen

41:48.723 --> 41:51.334
and write these all by hand,

41:51.334 --> 41:55.077
and then, uh, using
a pair of scissors,

41:55.077 --> 41:57.776
cut them into strips.

42:02.868 --> 42:07.525
It was a very satisfying
arts and crafts project.

42:08.308 --> 42:09.918
Calming.

42:13.922 --> 42:15.576
They're all original.

42:15.576 --> 42:17.578
Have a look.

42:36.118 --> 42:39.382
"A ship in harbor is safe,

42:39.382 --> 42:41.733
but that's not why
ships are built."

42:55.964 --> 43:00.012
"A ship in harbor is safe,

43:00.012 --> 43:03.581
but that's not why
ships are built."

43:16.506 --> 43:19.771
- You see what it means, right?
- Yes.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.046
What a joy this exercise was.

45:19.804 --> 45:21.327
Daddy, I'm done.

45:21.327 --> 45:23.111
Can I have
the fortune cookies now?

45:23.111 --> 45:24.678
- Hmm?
- I'm done.

45:24.678 --> 45:27.072
Can I have
the fortune cookies?

45:27.986 --> 45:29.683
All right.

45:42.391 --> 45:46.526
"You will travel
to many exotic-exotic places

45:46.526 --> 45:49.572
in your lifetime."
Cool.

45:49.572 --> 45:52.140
- You better take me, too.
- Okay.

45:52.140 --> 45:54.577
Let me see
what mine says.

45:54.577 --> 45:57.885
I'm just a kid,
so how could I not take you?

45:57.885 --> 46:00.888
Well, it's been done.

46:00.888 --> 46:04.762
"Some pursue happiness,
you create it."

46:14.815 --> 46:18.558
"A cheerful letter or message
is on its way to you."

46:18.558 --> 46:19.820
- Oh.
- Wow.

46:23.345 --> 46:25.260
Let's see.

46:31.876 --> 46:33.878
"No obstacles
will stand in the way

46:33.878 --> 46:36.184
of your success this month."

46:36.184 --> 46:38.099
- Perfect.
- Me.

46:50.546 --> 46:54.072
"You deserve to have a good time
after a hard day's work."

46:54.072 --> 46:57.162
- Like this.
- Damn right, yeah.

46:57.162 --> 46:59.207
"Your friends will be
truly helpful

46:59.207 --> 47:01.122
in your next month's
endeavor."

47:58.614 --> 48:01.400
I don't understand
what this means.

48:01.400 --> 48:05.795
Is this number
a Chinese omen or something?

50:17.362 --> 50:19.494
- How's it going?
- Well.

50:22.802 --> 50:26.588
What city in Afghanistan
were you born in?

50:28.721 --> 50:30.288
Kabul.

50:32.029 --> 50:33.943
I was born
in Shenzhen.

50:37.164 --> 50:39.819
I was just looking
at the world.

50:55.095 --> 50:56.923
In Afghanistan,

50:56.923 --> 50:59.708
you have many different
people, right?

51:00.622 --> 51:01.623
Yes.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.844
In China, too.

51:06.628 --> 51:10.502
Did you know
China and Afghanistan

51:10.502 --> 51:12.330
share a border?

51:14.288 --> 51:15.724
Did you know?

51:15.724 --> 51:17.813
Yes, I did.

51:20.599 --> 51:23.080
I think people
who share borders

51:23.080 --> 51:25.778
share many similarities.

51:27.084 --> 51:29.999
Us, we share a border,

51:29.999 --> 51:32.872
so we have similarities.

51:39.661 --> 51:42.882
It's okay to feel lonely sometimes.

51:44.144 --> 51:46.407
It would be very strange

51:46.407 --> 51:48.757
if people did not feel lonely.

51:51.847 --> 51:54.894
If they did not think
about other possibilities...

52:01.205 --> 52:02.945
about other people.

54:55.379 --> 54:58.338
Most Afghans I know

54:58.338 --> 55:00.340
who live in Fremont
work in Fremont.

55:00.340 --> 55:04.213
Why do you have
a job in San Francisco?

55:04.213 --> 55:08.174
I thought it would be good to be
out of Fremont half of the day.

55:08.174 --> 55:10.481
I wake up, I see Afghans.

55:10.481 --> 55:15.616
I go to sleep, the last people
I see, they're Afghans.

55:15.616 --> 55:19.359
And I thought it would be lovely

55:19.359 --> 55:22.449
to see Chinese people sometimes.

55:22.449 --> 55:25.278
You don't enjoy
being with Afghans?

55:26.975 --> 55:28.455
Some of them, yes.

55:28.455 --> 55:30.196
Some of them, no.

55:33.852 --> 55:37.464
Let me tell you a little of
the story of White Fang.

55:39.771 --> 55:43.383
White Fang is the sole survivor
of his family

55:43.383 --> 55:46.952
who were decimated by famine.

55:48.606 --> 55:51.957
And so, he has to learn

55:51.957 --> 55:55.482
to navigate the harsh reality
of the north,

55:55.482 --> 55:59.181
which is kill, or be killed.

56:01.401 --> 56:05.449
None of his experiences
prepare him for his owner,

56:05.449 --> 56:11.455
who turns him
into a vicious killer.

56:14.414 --> 56:18.287
This cruel man has him fighting
other dogs to the death.

56:19.811 --> 56:22.030
And it's during
one of these fights

56:22.030 --> 56:24.337
that White Fang meets his match

56:24.337 --> 56:26.774
in a bulldog
who nearly kills him.

56:28.385 --> 56:30.387
Fortunately, he's rescued

56:30.387 --> 56:32.998
by a man named Scott

56:32.998 --> 56:38.525
who takes White Fang in
and tames him.

56:38.525 --> 56:41.746
He brings him back to California

56:41.746 --> 56:46.490
where White Fang learns to love
Scott and Scott's family.

56:46.490 --> 56:48.666
Now, eventually,

56:48.666 --> 56:54.193
White Fang has puppies
with Collie,

56:54.193 --> 56:56.935
Scott's other dog,

56:56.935 --> 57:02.549
and they live
happily ever after.

57:07.162 --> 57:11.558
He didn't think these things,
Donya, he merely did them.

57:11.558 --> 57:15.475
He wasn't directed
by abstract reasoning,

57:15.475 --> 57:20.045
but by instinct, sensation,

57:22.526 --> 57:24.963
and emotion.

57:27.356 --> 57:29.620
What's the meaning
of "decimated"?

57:29.620 --> 57:31.839
Wiped out.

57:32.797 --> 57:34.233
Killed.

57:35.364 --> 57:36.931
Destroyed.

01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:28.059
I can sell you coffee
if you like.

01:00:28.059 --> 01:00:29.626
Okay.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.628
- Milk?
- No, thanks.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:34.674
- Sugar?
- Black is fine.

01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:47.426
- Are you happy working here?
- Yes, thanks.

01:00:47.426 --> 01:00:49.863
That'll be $2.50.

01:00:53.214 --> 01:00:55.129
Okay.

01:01:25.551 --> 01:01:27.379
Hello?

01:01:27.379 --> 01:01:29.729
I think I have a blind date.

01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:32.340
I got a text message.

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.691
When did this come about?

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:36.780
It's a long story.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.520
Well, this is very unexpected.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.392
Wait, read me the message.

01:01:40.392 --> 01:01:42.960
I'll tell you if he's legit.
It's a man, right?

01:01:44.135 --> 01:01:46.180
Sounds like he is.

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.661
And you're into men, right?

01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:51.882
I think so, yes.

01:01:51.882 --> 01:01:53.100
Read me the message.

01:02:02.631 --> 01:02:05.809
Okay, he says,

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:09.160
"I don't know if
you are still available."

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.250
Good, he's polite.

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:15.993
"I would love to see you
at the Asia Blue Pottery shop,

01:02:15.993 --> 01:02:18.778
which is on 70 Avenue, Bakersfield,

01:02:18.778 --> 01:02:20.780
on Saturday afternoon."

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:22.782
Okay, this is getting better.

01:02:22.782 --> 01:02:25.916
If he wants to meet somewhere
public, he's not a creep.

01:02:25.916 --> 01:02:28.527
And it sounds like maybe
he works at that pottery place,

01:02:28.527 --> 01:02:31.704
which is great, too,
because it means he has a job.

01:02:31.704 --> 01:02:33.445
So, maybe he's a potter.

01:02:35.273 --> 01:02:38.058
He says, "Ask for the deer."

01:02:40.408 --> 01:02:42.280
What?

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:45.457
He says, "Ask for the deer."

01:02:48.416 --> 01:02:50.984
Someone who has
the nickname "Deer"

01:02:50.984 --> 01:02:54.814
can either be very arrogant
or very hot,

01:02:54.814 --> 01:02:57.164
- or both of them.
- Or none of them.

01:02:58.905 --> 01:03:00.820
I'm gonna lend you my mom's car
to go to Bakersfield.

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:01.995
It's a few hours away.

01:03:03.867 --> 01:03:06.391
I don't know if I'm going to go.

01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:09.568
Yes. Yes, you are definitely
going to go.

01:03:12.136 --> 01:03:16.357
"White Fang, uncompanionable,
solitary, morose,

01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:18.925
scarcely looking
to right or left,

01:03:18.925 --> 01:03:21.536
redoubtable,
forbidding of aspect,

01:03:21.536 --> 01:03:24.017
remote and alien,

01:03:24.017 --> 01:03:28.152
was accepted as an equal
by his puzzled elders.

01:03:28.152 --> 01:03:30.545
They quickly learned
to leave him alone,

01:03:30.545 --> 01:03:32.417
neither venturing hostile acts,

01:03:32.417 --> 01:03:35.202
nor making overtures
of friendliness.

01:03:35.202 --> 01:03:38.292
If they left him alone,
he left them alone.

01:03:38.292 --> 01:03:40.599
A state of affairs
that they found,

01:03:40.599 --> 01:03:42.688
after a few encounters,

01:03:42.688 --> 01:03:45.734
to be pre-eminently desirable.

01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:52.829
In mid-summer, White Fang
had an experience.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:57.311
Trotting along in his silent way
to investigate a new tepee,

01:03:57.311 --> 01:03:59.270
which had been erected
on the edge of the village

01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:02.403
while he was away with
the hunters after moose,

01:04:02.403 --> 01:04:05.102
he came full upon his mother.

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.629
He paused and looked at her.

01:04:13.414 --> 01:04:16.765
He remembered her vaguely,
but he remembered her,

01:04:16.765 --> 01:04:19.856
and that was more
than could be said for her.

01:04:23.337 --> 01:04:27.428
She lifted her lip at him
in the old snarl of menace,

01:04:27.428 --> 01:04:29.778
and his memory became clear.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:33.478
His forgotten cubhood...

01:04:35.654 --> 01:04:38.875
all that was associated
with that familiar snarl,

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:40.615
rushed back to him.

01:04:45.055 --> 01:04:47.144
Before he had known the gods,

01:04:47.144 --> 01:04:50.887
she'd been to him
the center pin of the universe."

01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:06.163
White Fang is a very brave dog.

01:05:06.163 --> 01:05:08.208
He's a wolf.

01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:16.913
I relate to him

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:20.742
just like he wasn't accepted
by the other pups...

01:05:20.742 --> 01:05:23.397
- ...because he was a wolf.

01:05:23.397 --> 01:05:27.445
I was never accepted
by the other translators

01:05:27.445 --> 01:05:29.490
because I'm a woman.

01:05:40.545 --> 01:05:43.461
I was separated
from my mother, too,

01:05:43.461 --> 01:05:46.768
when I was forced to come here.

01:05:57.083 --> 01:05:59.694
It's a very touching story.

01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:07.876
I'm glad you love the story
as much as I do.

01:07:30.785 --> 01:07:32.657
I'm Donya.

01:07:35.486 --> 01:07:37.183
You're so kind.

01:07:41.927 --> 01:07:43.842
Thank you.

01:07:43.842 --> 01:07:45.887
I'm happy to be here.

01:08:00.119 --> 01:08:01.555
I'm good with anything.

01:08:01.555 --> 01:08:03.818
You can order
for the both of us.

01:10:31.662 --> 01:10:32.967
Hi.

01:10:34.404 --> 01:10:36.232
Uh, you need a hand?

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.973
No, just
checking the oil.

01:10:38.973 --> 01:10:41.541
- You can manage?
- Yes.

01:10:41.541 --> 01:10:43.761
All right.

01:10:43.761 --> 01:10:46.416
Uh, you sell oil here?

01:10:46.416 --> 01:10:48.896
No need to buy it.

01:11:03.389 --> 01:11:05.043
Here.

01:11:09.047 --> 01:11:10.657
- Can you help me?
- Yeah.

01:11:12.833 --> 01:11:15.445
Okay. Thanks.

01:11:18.317 --> 01:11:20.276
You know how to use
that dipstick, though, right?

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:21.320
Dipstick?

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.366
Dipstick, yeah, it's...

01:11:23.366 --> 01:11:25.759
that right there.

01:11:25.759 --> 01:11:29.023
My brother taught me
how to check the oil,

01:11:29.023 --> 01:11:31.374
but I never
had to change it.

01:11:34.115 --> 01:11:37.162
Well... it's all done.

01:11:40.731 --> 01:11:44.082
- There's some oil left in there.
- Thank you.

01:11:53.047 --> 01:11:55.528
Dipstick's also an idiot.

01:11:57.225 --> 01:11:58.357
It's, uh...

01:12:00.228 --> 01:12:02.318
I mean, the...

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:05.233
the word "dipstick"
means "idiot."

01:12:09.541 --> 01:12:10.543
Here.

01:12:14.939 --> 01:12:17.768
Uh, can I leave
the car here?

01:12:17.768 --> 01:12:19.987
I'm gonna get
something to eat.

01:12:19.987 --> 01:12:21.859
Sure, I was about to go

01:12:21.859 --> 01:12:23.904
get something to eat
myself, too, so...

01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:46.117
Where are you from?

01:13:47.248 --> 01:13:48.772
Fremont.

01:13:50.295 --> 01:13:52.036
Where are you headed?

01:13:52.036 --> 01:13:54.559
I'm going to Bakersfield.

01:13:58.477 --> 01:14:00.958
Your accent doesn't sound
very Fremont.

01:14:03.787 --> 01:14:07.312
- I'm from Afghanistan.
- You studying?

01:14:08.835 --> 01:14:10.228
I'm a writer.

01:14:15.886 --> 01:14:18.062
I've never met
an Afghanistani before.

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:23.633
- Afghan.
- An Afghan.

01:14:23.633 --> 01:14:26.462
You-you're the first
Afghan I've met.

01:14:33.947 --> 01:14:36.080
You seem like a friendly people.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.213
We are.

01:14:39.213 --> 01:14:41.868
I'm just not a good example.

01:14:45.132 --> 01:14:48.309
I'm, um, I'm alone all day,

01:14:48.309 --> 01:14:52.139
so that's why I talk so much
during my lunch break.

01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:56.317
Actually, thinking I should
hire someone

01:14:56.317 --> 01:14:58.624
so I can have someone
to talk to.

01:15:01.671 --> 01:15:04.804
I am actually thinking
I should hire someone.

01:15:04.804 --> 01:15:08.547
I never understood
how a single mechanic

01:15:08.547 --> 01:15:10.505
can bear the responsibility
on his shoulders.

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:12.769
You know, deciding
if a car is good to go.

01:15:14.639 --> 01:15:17.382
All responsible jobs,
they're performed in twos.

01:15:17.382 --> 01:15:22.430
Right? You think of airline
pilots or surgeons.

01:15:24.258 --> 01:15:26.304
Cars carry lives.

01:15:26.304 --> 01:15:29.655
What if one day
I'm a bit distracted

01:15:29.655 --> 01:15:31.614
or in a very bad mood?

01:15:33.398 --> 01:15:34.965
True.

01:15:46.672 --> 01:15:48.065
And sometimes,
you just wanna be alone

01:15:48.065 --> 01:15:49.936
and eat your sandwich, right?

01:15:54.898 --> 01:15:57.291
I have something
I have to do anyway.

01:16:03.733 --> 01:16:07.432
Um... can I offer you
a cup of coffee?

01:16:10.391 --> 01:16:14.134
I don't drink coffee.
Thank you.

01:18:19.999 --> 01:18:22.567
I'm not really
a writer.

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:29.313
I just write
fortune cookie messages,

01:18:30.967 --> 01:18:34.405
and usually for
a Chinese restaurant.

01:18:38.191 --> 01:18:41.151
I don't eat at Chinese
restaurants very often.

01:18:43.327 --> 01:18:46.939
I'll usually
eat my lunch here and, uh...

01:18:46.939 --> 01:18:49.333
well, for dinner,
I'll-I'll eat here too.

01:19:04.914 --> 01:19:07.786
How much do I owe you?

01:19:10.093 --> 01:19:11.964
No, it's on the house.

01:19:16.273 --> 01:19:18.666
If you ever come back,
it'll be on the house, too.

01:19:23.193 --> 01:19:24.541
Thank you.

01:19:29.852 --> 01:19:31.723
It was nice to meet you.

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:34.594
And you.

01:20:41.749 --> 01:20:44.796
Welcome to Asia Blue,
may I help you?

01:20:44.796 --> 01:20:46.798
I'm looking for the deer.

01:20:46.798 --> 01:20:49.583
One second.

01:21:24.443 --> 01:21:26.751
You work at the cookie factory, right?

01:21:29.754 --> 01:21:32.583
The owner of the factory
is a friend of my boss.

01:21:32.583 --> 01:21:35.281
She told me you would've
came today but...

01:21:35.281 --> 01:21:37.066
she's been postponing
for one month

01:21:37.066 --> 01:21:39.111
and didn't want us
to deliver it.

01:21:42.549 --> 01:21:45.248
She didn't wanna pay
delivery fees.

01:22:07.052 --> 01:22:08.619
Do you want me to wrap it up?

01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:44.688
I brought you a deer.

01:25:08.014 --> 01:25:09.800
I really wanted one.

01:25:24.771 --> 01:25:26.164
