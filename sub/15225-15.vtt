01:21.067 --> 01:24.734
Uh, what's the problem?

01:24.767 --> 01:26.634
I can't find
an apartment.

01:26.667 --> 01:28.901
I thought you had an apartment.

01:28.934 --> 01:30.267
No, I lost it.

01:30.300 --> 01:33.934
That happens to me all the time.

01:34.934 --> 01:38.801
Sometimes,
I can't find mine for days.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.467
Jim, I told you
all about this yesterday.

01:45.667 --> 01:47.100
Jim, remember?

01:47.133 --> 01:48.767
They're turning
Elaine's apartment house

01:48.801 --> 01:50.100
into a co-op.

01:50.133 --> 01:52.434
She can't afford to
buy the apartment

01:52.467 --> 01:55.434
so she has to look
for a new one.

01:55.467 --> 01:56.901
Oh, now I remember.

01:56.934 --> 01:59.968
You did tell me this yesterday.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.467
Hey, good going, Jim.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.467
Did you look
over in Brooklyn?

02:08.501 --> 02:13.667
That's usually
where mine turns up.

02:13.701 --> 02:16.734
 Jim, your apartment
 <i>is</i> in Brooklyn.

02:16.767 --> 02:18.767
Again?

02:22.834 --> 02:24.834
Hey, come on, Elaine,
worst comes to worst,

02:24.868 --> 02:27.067
you sleep on my couch
for a couple of nights.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.567
Oh, uh, thanks, Alex, but, uh,

02:28.601 --> 02:31.367
I've slept on your couch,
and it's not that comfortable.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.634
When did you ever sleep
on my couch?

02:33.667 --> 02:35.601
The night you showed slides
from your ski trip.

02:35.634 --> 02:37.300
Oh, that <i>is</i>
an uncomfortable couch.

02:37.334 --> 02:40.300
Well, you could sleep
on my couch, Elaine.

02:40.334 --> 02:42.901
Listen, thank you both
for your offers,

02:42.934 --> 02:45.901
but I don't want to
impose on either one of you.

02:45.934 --> 02:48.567
Really, I refuse
to stay with you guys.

02:48.601 --> 02:49.901
Hey, Elaine, you
got a boyfriend?

02:49.934 --> 02:51.868
I mean, you and Steve
are still seeing
each other, right?

02:51.901 --> 02:53.701
Oh, yeah. We're doing great.

02:53.734 --> 02:55.100
Then why don't you sleep
on <i>his</i> couch.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.400
No, no, Tony.

02:56.434 --> 02:58.701
It's a little too early
in the relationship. You know?

02:58.734 --> 03:00.033
I don't want to scare him off.

03:00.067 --> 03:02.167
You look that bad
in the morning, huh?

03:04.334 --> 03:06.300
Hey, guys, I got it!
I got the job!

03:06.334 --> 03:07.300
All right.
What?!

03:07.334 --> 03:08.667
Yeah, I can't believe it!

03:08.701 --> 03:09.868
A whole month on tour.

03:09.901 --> 03:11.334
Oh, that's great.
Oh, congratulations.

03:11.367 --> 03:12.734
Oh, thanks, Elaine.

03:12.767 --> 03:14.901
You know, this is what
acting is all about--

03:14.934 --> 03:16.367
touring to the people--

03:16.400 --> 03:18.367
people who ordinarily
wouldn't be enriched

03:18.400 --> 03:20.701
by the catharsis of the
classical theater experience.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.501
What play
are you doing?

03:22.534 --> 03:24.834
 <i>Under the Yum Yum Tree.</i>

03:24.868 --> 03:28.367
I thought that was
 <i>Desire Under The Yum Yum Tree.</i>

03:28.400 --> 03:30.400
That's another good one, Ton.

03:30.434 --> 03:31.801
Oh, Bobby,
does this mean

03:31.834 --> 03:33.634
I can have
your apartment?!

03:33.667 --> 03:35.868
Yeah. I told you if I got the
part, you got the apartment.

03:35.901 --> 03:37.534
Oh, great!
A place to stay.

03:37.567 --> 03:39.367
So, Bobby, what are you
gonna do to celebrate?

03:39.400 --> 03:41.133
Rub Louie's nose in it.

03:43.767 --> 03:44.901
Uh, hey, Louie,

03:44.934 --> 03:47.901
I hate to ruin
your day like this,

03:47.934 --> 03:50.901
but I just got
a real good acting job.

03:50.934 --> 03:51.901
Bobby!

03:51.934 --> 03:53.000
Really?

03:53.033 --> 03:56.234
That's wonderful,
that's wonderful!

03:56.267 --> 03:58.367
Hey, I got to announce this.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.868
Wait till everybody hears.

03:59.901 --> 04:02.167
No, Louie,
that's not necessary, really.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.601
Are you kidding?

04:03.634 --> 04:07.367
I insist on telling everybody
how wrong I was about you.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.367
All right, attention here.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.267
Attention, cabbies.

04:11.300 --> 04:15.601
All right, you all know
that Bobby Wheeler has taken

04:15.634 --> 04:18.601
a lot of heat from me
in the past

04:18.634 --> 04:20.367
about his acting career.

04:20.399 --> 04:25.367
I just found out
that our Bob has landed the lead

04:25.400 --> 04:29.601
in a major New York
Broadway production.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.868
Louie, Louie,
it's not a Broadway play.

04:34.901 --> 04:36.367
It's a tour.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.200
I'm doing a tour.

04:38.234 --> 04:39.868
Oh.

04:39.901 --> 04:41.067
Correction.

04:41.100 --> 04:44.767
Bob tells me
it is a starring role

04:44.801 --> 04:48.234
in one of the biggest
cross-country tours

04:48.267 --> 04:51.567
in the history
of the American Theater.

04:51.601 --> 04:53.901
( <i>cheering</i> )

04:53.934 --> 04:56.234
Louie, it's not
a cross-country tour.

04:56.267 --> 04:57.901
It's a small tour.

04:57.934 --> 05:00.334
I'm going to three places,
you know?

05:00.367 --> 05:03.267
Oh.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.267
Correction once again.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.901
Bobby's got a teensy part

05:07.934 --> 05:11.901
with a sleazy company
in three trailer parks.

05:11.934 --> 05:15.000
I'm going to kill him,
I'm going to kill him!

05:20.901 --> 05:22.367
I don't know,
Elaine.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.701
Bobby's been gone
about a week,

05:23.734 --> 05:24.868
and you've got
his apartment

05:24.901 --> 05:26.200
looking the best
it's ever looked.

05:26.234 --> 05:27.367
Oh, thanks.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.033
It's this old interior decorator
trick I learned,

05:29.067 --> 05:30.534
called cleaning.

05:30.567 --> 05:32.033
Oh.

05:32.067 --> 05:34.534
Tony.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.567
Stains.

05:37.634 --> 05:40.400
Elaine, the apartment
looks great, fantastic.

05:40.434 --> 05:41.701
Oh, I don't know,

05:41.734 --> 05:43.300
I guess I did
do a little puttering, huh?

05:43.334 --> 05:46.267
Do you think Bobby
will mind?

05:46.300 --> 05:48.267
Why don't you ask him?

05:48.300 --> 05:50.634
Hey, Bobby,
am I glad to see you.

05:50.667 --> 05:51.701
Hey, how you
doing, man?

05:51.734 --> 05:53.400
Eh, it hasn't been
the same without you.

05:53.434 --> 05:54.901
Don't seem like
you been gone a month.

05:54.934 --> 05:56.067
I've been gone a week.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.234
That feels right.

05:57.267 --> 05:58.400
Hey, well,
it doesn't matter

05:58.434 --> 05:59.734
that you've only
been gone a week.

05:59.767 --> 06:00.868
The point is,
you're back.

06:00.901 --> 06:02.901
No, the point is,
it's only been a week.

06:02.934 --> 06:06.334
Oh, uh, you know, I got tired
of Florida, you know?

06:06.367 --> 06:07.334
( <i>sniffing</i> )

06:07.367 --> 06:08.834
You smell
something funny?

06:08.868 --> 06:10.000
No.

06:10.033 --> 06:11.167
Neither do I.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.834
Is this my apartment?

06:12.868 --> 06:15.367
Hey, I want
a glass of wine, too.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.300
Bobby, if you don't want to talk

06:19.334 --> 06:20.834
about
the Florida thing...

06:20.868 --> 06:22.334
Hey, what's to talk about?

06:22.367 --> 06:23.534
I left for a month
and came back

06:23.567 --> 06:24.701
three weeks early,
that's all.

06:24.734 --> 06:26.200
Quit the tour, huh?

06:26.234 --> 06:27.534
Yeah, I quit.

06:27.567 --> 06:28.701
Got fired.

06:28.734 --> 06:30.567
We're talking
semantics here.

06:30.601 --> 06:33.567
It's all a matter of who
says good-bye first, right?

06:33.601 --> 06:35.868
Oh, Bobby.

06:35.901 --> 06:37.434
ALEX:
Why? What happened?

06:37.467 --> 06:39.334
The whole thing
is so unprofessional.

06:39.367 --> 06:41.367
Everybody knows
when you go out

06:41.400 --> 06:43.067
on these long tours, you know,

06:43.100 --> 06:44.767
men and women, close quarters

06:44.801 --> 06:46.334
sometimes
for months,

06:46.367 --> 06:47.868
affairs--
they're inevitable.

06:47.901 --> 06:50.367
I had one
with the costume girl.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.534
When?

06:51.567 --> 06:54.834
On the bus ride down to Florida.

06:54.868 --> 06:56.934
You got fired for not waiting
till you got there?

07:00.834 --> 07:02.834
I got fired
because it turns out

07:02.868 --> 07:05.234
that she
was the director's daughter.

07:05.267 --> 07:06.901
Oh.
Oh.

07:06.934 --> 07:09.567
I'm surprised you lasted
a week in Florida.

07:09.601 --> 07:10.968
I lasted a <i>day</i> in Florida--

07:11.000 --> 07:13.067
I spent three days
on the bus ride back.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.267
Meet anyone on that trip?

07:14.300 --> 07:15.834
No, that's
all right.

07:15.868 --> 07:17.334
Will you,
please?

07:17.367 --> 07:19.000
Oh, what the heck.

07:19.033 --> 07:21.000
It happened,
it's over,

07:21.033 --> 07:22.501
and I'm home.

07:22.534 --> 07:24.834
And I'm, uh,
kind of tired, guys,

07:24.868 --> 07:26.234
so, if you don't mind,
you know?

07:26.267 --> 07:27.968
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah.
We were shoving off anyway.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.167
Come on.
Come on, guys, let's go.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.200
Um, well, Bobby,

07:31.234 --> 07:33.868
uh, there may be
a little problem here.

07:33.901 --> 07:35.868
You see, I haven't
found an apartment yet,

07:35.901 --> 07:37.534
and now that
you're back early...

07:37.567 --> 07:38.701
So, we'll just
stay here

07:38.734 --> 07:40.133
together for a
while, that's all.

07:40.167 --> 07:42.701
Hey, you can have
the bedroom,

07:42.734 --> 07:44.033
and I'll sleep
on the sofa.

07:44.067 --> 07:45.200
Oh, well, okay.

07:45.234 --> 07:47.367
I mean, I don't see
why I shouldn't.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.033
ALEX:
You don't?

07:49.067 --> 07:50.200
ELAINE:
No. Do you?

07:50.234 --> 07:51.367
Me? No, I don't.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.367
You, Tony?

07:52.400 --> 07:53.534
Hell, yes.

07:53.567 --> 07:56.267
I do, too.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.634
Hey, wait a minute.

07:57.667 --> 08:00.334
If you guys are thinking
what I think you're thinking,

08:00.367 --> 08:01.601
you're way off base.

08:01.634 --> 08:02.601
Elaine is a friend of mine.

08:02.634 --> 08:03.601
She needs a place to stay.

08:03.634 --> 08:05.868
She'll stay here
and everything will be fine.

08:05.901 --> 08:07.501
Oh, yeah,
sure it will.

08:07.534 --> 08:08.667
Of course it will.

08:08.701 --> 08:10.000
So let's not hear
anymore about it.

08:10.033 --> 08:12.300
Alex, there's something
on your mind.

08:12.334 --> 08:13.300
On my mind?

08:13.334 --> 08:14.300
No, there's nothing
on my mind.

08:14.334 --> 08:15.667
Anything
on your mind, Tony?

08:15.701 --> 08:17.801
Hell, yes.
Mine, too.

08:17.834 --> 08:19.834
Now, listen, guys, I'm starting
to resent this a little.

08:19.868 --> 08:21.334
Huh? Oh, yeah,
you're right.

08:21.367 --> 08:22.501
I'm sorry.

08:22.534 --> 08:24.367
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Come on, we're acting crazy.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.501
You're right.

08:25.534 --> 08:27.334
I mean, it's just late at night,
and we're all tired

08:27.367 --> 08:28.501
and this is so sudden,
you know?

08:28.534 --> 08:30.000
Look, Elaine,
why don't you just turn in.

08:30.033 --> 08:31.167
Bobby, you unpack.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.333
Tony, you call the vice squad.

08:32.366 --> 08:33.433
I'm standing watch...

08:33.467 --> 08:35.501
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

08:35.534 --> 08:37.167
 It's just a joke.
( <i>laughs</i> )

08:37.200 --> 08:38.868
Come on, Tony.

08:38.900 --> 08:40.200
Hey, Bobby.
Yeah?

08:40.234 --> 08:42.299
You try anything on her,
and I'll kill you.

08:42.333 --> 08:43.634
Tony, come on.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.200
This is Elaine
we're talking about, remember?

08:45.234 --> 08:46.400
Oh, yeah, right.

08:46.434 --> 08:48.033
Elaine, you try
anything on him,

08:48.067 --> 08:49.400
and I'll kill you.

08:49.434 --> 08:51.367
ALEX:
Let's go.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.200
Good night,
you two.

08:53.234 --> 08:54.133
Good night!

08:54.167 --> 08:55.434
Good night.

08:56.434 --> 08:57.534
My gosh.

08:57.567 --> 08:58.701
Could you give me
a hand here?

08:58.734 --> 08:59.868
Yeah, there's
that extra cover.

08:59.901 --> 09:01.801
Oh, man, am I beat.

09:01.834 --> 09:02.868
TONY:
 <i>You know, this is Bobby,</i>

09:02.901 --> 09:04.334
 <i>and you know</i>
 <i>what Bobby's like.</i>

09:04.367 --> 09:05.868
 ALEX:
 <i>Yeah, I know</i>
 <i>what he's like,</i>

09:05.901 --> 09:07.234
 <i>but what are we</i>
 <i>gonna do about it?</i>

09:07.267 --> 09:08.667
 <i>I mean, we got to</i>
 <i>trust him, right?</i>

09:08.701 --> 09:10.734
 <i>Trust him? I know a girl</i>
 <i>on a bus who trusted him.</i>

09:10.767 --> 09:12.000
 <i>Look what happened.</i>

09:12.033 --> 09:13.400
 <i>Eh... you're right.</i>

09:13.434 --> 09:14.501
 <i>The man's a hound.</i>

09:14.534 --> 09:17.367
 <i>Yeah, anywhere, anytime,</i>
 <i>anything with a pulse.</i>

09:22.567 --> 09:24.534
You think
they heard us?

09:24.567 --> 09:26.534
No, I don't
think so.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.534
Do you?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.267
Hell, yes.
Me, too.

09:46.634 --> 09:49.601
I thought she
had an apartment.

09:49.634 --> 09:53.267
Jim, they're turning
her apartment into a co-op.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.501
Remember?

09:54.534 --> 09:56.300
Oh, yeah.

09:56.334 --> 09:59.267
So while she looks around,
she's staying with Bobby.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.467
Well, that's real nice of Bobby
to put her up like that.

10:02.501 --> 10:04.133
Yeah, sure. <i>Real</i> nice.

10:04.167 --> 10:06.534
I don't trust him
for one minute.

10:06.567 --> 10:10.000
Call me old-fashioned,
but this setup bothers me.

10:10.033 --> 10:14.000
Well, times are changing
too fast for me too.

10:14.033 --> 10:17.100
Orgies where anything goes.

10:17.133 --> 10:21.400
People wandering around naked
in public places.

10:21.434 --> 10:25.901
Sex that means no more than
a handshake on the street.

10:25.934 --> 10:27.234
I don't know.

10:27.267 --> 10:30.868
Call me corny,
but I miss those things.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.100
You know, this setup
still bothers me.

10:37.133 --> 10:38.467
Tony, will you
come off it?

10:38.501 --> 10:40.234
Now look, there's
nothing going on

10:40.267 --> 10:41.667
between Elaine and Bobby.

10:41.701 --> 10:44.234
Besides, she's stuck on
that guy Steve, right?

10:44.267 --> 10:46.067
And even if she weren't,
Bobby's your best friend.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.100
That's got to count
for something, right?

10:49.534 --> 10:50.567
Hey, guys.

10:50.601 --> 10:51.834
ALEX:
Hey, Bob!

10:51.868 --> 10:54.200
You're right,
Alex.

10:54.234 --> 10:55.200
Hey, Bobby,

10:55.234 --> 10:57.200
I got to talk to you.

10:57.234 --> 10:58.234
Yeah, okay.

10:59.734 --> 11:01.100
You know, this thing
with you and Elaine

11:01.133 --> 11:02.133
has really
been bothering me,

11:02.167 --> 11:05.100
but if you tell me right now,
as my best friend,

11:05.133 --> 11:06.567
that there's
nothing going on,

11:06.601 --> 11:07.901
then that's good enough
for me.

11:07.934 --> 11:11.234
Hey, Tony, there's
nothing going on.

11:11.267 --> 11:13.667
How dumb do you think he is,
Wheeler?

11:16.100 --> 11:18.701
I'll show you
how dumb I am, Louie.

11:18.734 --> 11:20.801
I believe you,
Bobby.

11:21.934 --> 11:23.000
Nardo.

11:23.033 --> 11:25.200
You and Wheeler
better be careful.

11:25.234 --> 11:27.367
You'll be hearing
the pitter-patter

11:27.400 --> 11:29.934
of little hams
in the house.

11:31.767 --> 11:33.234
How's it going,
Elaine?

11:33.267 --> 11:34.234
Ah, terrific.

11:34.267 --> 11:35.234
Yeah?

11:35.267 --> 11:37.234
Yeah, it's been
a good week.

11:37.267 --> 11:38.734
Yeah, it's been
you know, real nice.

11:38.767 --> 11:40.367
I came home late
from the gallery

11:40.400 --> 11:42.701
last night, you know,
and Bobby was up reading,

11:42.734 --> 11:44.400
so we had a glass
of wine together

11:44.434 --> 11:46.367
and talked real easily
about some things

11:46.400 --> 11:48.234
I don't think I
could've talked about

11:48.267 --> 11:49.601
with any other man.

11:49.634 --> 11:50.868
Oh, really?

11:50.901 --> 11:52.033
Like what?

11:52.067 --> 11:54.567
Bobby's career,
Bobby's dreams...

11:54.601 --> 11:56.133
Bobby.

11:56.167 --> 11:59.167
How did you ever drag
all that out of him?

11:59.200 --> 12:01.033
I think I said,
"How are you?"

12:01.067 --> 12:03.200
( <i>telephone rings</i> )
Gotcha.

12:04.734 --> 12:06.767
Hello?

12:06.801 --> 12:10.033
Elaine, it's for you.

12:10.067 --> 12:11.734
Steve?

12:11.767 --> 12:13.367
Oh, I'll take it.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.200
She's going
to talk to you.

12:16.234 --> 12:17.234
Thanks a lot.

12:18.834 --> 12:19.834
Hi, Steve.

12:21.501 --> 12:23.467
You know,
in my country,

12:23.501 --> 12:25.734
what Elaine and Bobby
are doing--

12:25.767 --> 12:27.767
it would be fine.

12:27.801 --> 12:31.801
In my country, it is tradition
for a man and woman

12:31.834 --> 12:34.734
to live together
before they are married.

12:36.434 --> 12:39.400
And to make love
in every possible way

12:39.434 --> 12:45.100
so then they can see if they
want to get married after that.

12:45.133 --> 12:46.100
Really?

12:46.133 --> 12:47.634
Yeah.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.267
Well,
that's a sensible tradition.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.467
Thank you.

12:51.501 --> 12:54.968
Now only if we can get
the women to buy it.

13:06.100 --> 13:07.734
Elaine...

13:07.767 --> 13:10.000
you okay?

13:10.033 --> 13:12.467
Uh, yeah, I think so.

13:12.501 --> 13:13.834
What happened?

13:13.868 --> 13:17.534
Well, uh, Steve called and said,

13:17.567 --> 13:18.868
can we get together for dinner

13:18.901 --> 13:21.367
so he could tell me
something important.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.367
And, uh, like an idiot,
I said, "What?"

13:24.400 --> 13:27.033
He said he didn't want to talk
about it over the phone,

13:27.067 --> 13:28.367
but I kept pressing,

13:28.400 --> 13:32.701
so, uh, he told me
that, uh, maybe it's better

13:32.734 --> 13:35.033
if we don't see each other
for a while.

13:35.067 --> 13:37.000
Aw...

13:37.033 --> 13:39.367
Something about more time
and more distance.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.901
Hey, I'll tell you
what let's do.

13:40.934 --> 13:43.534
I'll get the guys together,
and we'll go for some beers,

13:43.567 --> 13:45.868
to some nice place,
and we'll talk about it, okay?

13:45.901 --> 13:49.767
Thanks, Alex, but I think
I'm gonna go home for awhile.

13:49.801 --> 13:51.234
Elaine, I don't think
you ought to be alone

13:51.267 --> 13:52.567
at a time like this.

13:52.601 --> 13:54.067
I mean, not in the mood
that you're in.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.367
Oh, well, I-I won't
exactly be alone.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.167
I mean, Bobby
will be there.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.234
Oh, yeah, right. Bobby.

14:01.534 --> 14:02.968
Bobby?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.667
Did you...?

14:04.701 --> 14:06.834
Yeah, and, you know,
he can be real sweet

14:06.868 --> 14:09.868
and understanding
at a time like this.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.133
Bobby?

14:15.167 --> 14:16.868
Hey, Alex, see you.

14:16.901 --> 14:18.033
Yeah, see you, Bob.

14:18.067 --> 14:19.033
Hey, Bob, wait.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.534
Where you going?
Home.

14:20.567 --> 14:21.868
Home? Why home?

14:21.901 --> 14:23.701
That's where I live.

14:23.734 --> 14:26.033
Oh, yeah, uh, Bob,
come here.

14:26.067 --> 14:27.367
Uh... um, um...

14:27.400 --> 14:29.167
maybe I shouldn't
get involved

14:29.200 --> 14:30.534
in your life
like this,

14:30.567 --> 14:32.334
I mean, I'm the kind
of man that doesn't like

14:32.367 --> 14:34.701
to get involved
in his own life, but, uh...

14:34.734 --> 14:36.234
Steve just called Elaine.

14:36.267 --> 14:38.167
He broke it off with her.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.200
Oh, no.
Yeah.

14:39.234 --> 14:40.267
Oh, poor Elaine.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.000
Yeah, she's feeling very bad.

14:42.033 --> 14:45.267
Look, she just said she wanted
to go home and be by herself.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.968
Well, if you're going
to go home,

14:47.000 --> 14:48.767
that means you're
both going to be home--

14:48.801 --> 14:50.667
alone... together...

14:50.701 --> 14:53.067
for awhile.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.601
So what?

14:54.634 --> 14:56.234
No, no, Bob, Bob, look,

14:56.267 --> 14:57.968
I mean, she's feeling
kind of depressed.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.434
You know, she's very vulnerable.

14:59.467 --> 15:01.634
And, uh, there's no telling

15:01.667 --> 15:03.467
what she might do
in a mood like that.

15:03.501 --> 15:06.000
You think
she might come on to me?

15:06.033 --> 15:07.434
Well...

15:07.467 --> 15:08.701
Hey, Alex,

15:08.734 --> 15:10.601
really, thanks for the warning,

15:10.634 --> 15:12.868
and I'll be on my lookout, okay?

15:22.901 --> 15:25.067
Did you hear that?

15:25.100 --> 15:26.367
Of course I heard it.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.734
I was the one
he was talking to.
Oh.

15:28.767 --> 15:30.734
Elaine's heart is broken.

15:30.767 --> 15:31.868
Yeah.

15:31.901 --> 15:34.067
This is terrible.
Yeah.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.400
I'm afraid she's going
to try to forget her problems

15:37.434 --> 15:38.734
by losing herself

15:38.767 --> 15:41.400
in a night of shameful
lust and passion

15:41.434 --> 15:43.901
with the first man
to come and cross her path.

15:43.934 --> 15:46.834
You're afraid that's
gonna be Bobby, right?

15:46.868 --> 15:48.634
Well, if not,

15:48.667 --> 15:50.968
could you please
give her my phone number?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.300
Bobby?

16:11.334 --> 16:13.067
Uh-oh.

16:14.100 --> 16:15.634
Elaine, is that you?

16:15.667 --> 16:16.667
Yeah.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.367
I can't sleep.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.000
Is there any more wine?

16:21.033 --> 16:23.501
Wine? Oh, yeah.

16:23.534 --> 16:25.567
There's some more wine.

16:25.601 --> 16:27.534
Did I wake you?

16:27.567 --> 16:29.534
Oh, no,
I was wide awake.

16:29.567 --> 16:31.467
My head's clear as a bell.

16:31.501 --> 16:33.634
I'm not about to do or say
anything foolish.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.667
It's cold
in here, huh?

16:35.701 --> 16:37.567
You know, Elaine,
you might want

16:37.601 --> 16:39.300
to put a robe or two

16:39.334 --> 16:41.734
over your negligee.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.534
You know, Bobby,

16:43.567 --> 16:46.901
this Steve thing
has hit me pretty hard.

16:46.934 --> 16:49.167
Do you think
we could talk about it?

16:49.200 --> 16:50.167
Oh, yeah.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.267
Sure, okay.

16:56.033 --> 16:57.234
Hey, the guy's a jerk.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.767
You're better off without him.

16:58.801 --> 17:00.834
How's that?

17:00.868 --> 17:03.367
Oh, look, Elaine,
I'm sorry.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.701
Listen, the way this
guy handled this thing

17:05.733 --> 17:09.534
just proves he's not
the kind of guy

17:09.567 --> 17:10.767
who deserves you.

17:10.800 --> 17:14.834
Oh, Bobby.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.099
Oh, that is so sweet.

17:17.133 --> 17:18.800
Oh, God.

17:18.834 --> 17:22.233
Why aren't more guys
like you?

17:22.267 --> 17:25.701
You know, I have this
great bottle of wine

17:25.733 --> 17:27.166
in my suitcase

17:27.200 --> 17:29.834
that I've been saving
for a special occasion.

17:29.868 --> 17:33.300
I'm going to go get it.

17:38.901 --> 17:42.901
Oh, Bobby,
I'm so glad you're here.

17:52.734 --> 17:54.033
Hello, Alex, it's Bobby.

17:54.067 --> 17:55.367
She's all over me.

17:57.767 --> 17:59.734
Who were you calling
this late?

17:59.767 --> 18:02.667
Dad. Good old Dad.

18:02.701 --> 18:05.067
I thought your father
passed away.

18:05.100 --> 18:08.701
Well, maybe that will make up
for the times

18:08.734 --> 18:10.334
I didn't call when he was alive?

18:11.367 --> 18:13.734
What's wrong with you?

18:13.767 --> 18:16.234
Listen, Elaine.

18:16.267 --> 18:19.934
I really don't think
we should do this.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.100
We shouldn't do what?

18:21.133 --> 18:22.300
What are you talking about?

18:22.334 --> 18:26.334
Come on, Elaine, you know
where this is going, huh?

18:26.367 --> 18:28.100
The wine,
the soft lights...

18:28.133 --> 18:30.267
that flimsy
flannel thing.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.234
Where this...?

18:32.267 --> 18:33.801
Oh, my God.

18:33.834 --> 18:35.601
Bobby, are...?

18:35.634 --> 18:37.934
Oh, this is ridiculous!

18:37.968 --> 18:38.968
Oh, my gosh.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.968
Hey, trust me on this, baby.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.534
You know, I've been around.

18:42.567 --> 18:43.868
I'm a sophisticated guy.

18:43.901 --> 18:45.534
I've had a lot of experience.

18:45.567 --> 18:46.701
And a moment ago,

18:46.734 --> 18:48.334
you and I were on the road
to naughty-naughty.

18:48.367 --> 18:51.834
"The road to naughty-naughty"?

18:51.868 --> 18:53.033
Come on, Elaine.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.901
I'm trying to be delicate
about this thing.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.667
You want me to come right out
and say it?

18:56.701 --> 18:58.400
O-Okay.
I'll come right out and say it--

18:58.434 --> 19:00.534
You and I were that far away
from doing foo-foo.

19:02.834 --> 19:05.834
You're making me yearn
for four-letter words.

19:05.868 --> 19:08.000
Bobby!

19:08.033 --> 19:10.167
You are absolutely
and totally wrong.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.667
I mean, you are so wrong,
it's ludicrous.

19:12.701 --> 19:14.000
Elaine, I'm just trying to
do the right thing here.

19:14.033 --> 19:15.000
You know what I mean?

19:15.033 --> 19:16.100
You know,
I don't believe this.

19:16.133 --> 19:17.834
You and I have
the greatest relationship

19:17.868 --> 19:19.200
going on in the last two weeks,

19:19.234 --> 19:21.000
and I come to you
for a little friendship

19:21.033 --> 19:22.667
and a little sympathy,
and I get this.

19:22.701 --> 19:24.834
Okay!

19:24.868 --> 19:26.167
Okay, maybe I was wrong.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.501
Yes, you were.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.367
I guess I was jumping
to conclusions here.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.033
Oh, absolutely.

19:32.067 --> 19:33.801
Elaine, I'm really sorry.

19:33.834 --> 19:35.634
I really feel like a jerk.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.334
Well, you are one.

19:38.367 --> 19:39.834
But it's okay.

19:39.868 --> 19:43.167
Hey, um, can we
just kind of forget

19:43.200 --> 19:45.067
this ever happened?

19:45.100 --> 19:46.400
Huh?

19:46.434 --> 19:48.400
All right, all right.

19:48.434 --> 19:51.501
I don't see why not.

19:52.601 --> 19:54.267
Let's get this wine open.

19:54.300 --> 19:55.367
Yeah, here.

20:16.934 --> 20:20.100
Hi, guys.
How you doing?

20:20.133 --> 20:21.767
I was hoping you'd be home.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.601
It's 3:00
in the morning, Alex.

20:26.634 --> 20:27.901
What are you
doing here?

20:27.934 --> 20:30.934
I was just out taking a walk.

20:30.968 --> 20:32.300
Barefoot?

20:32.334 --> 20:33.434
Yeah. I, uh...

20:33.467 --> 20:36.467
I like the feeling
of snow in my toes.

20:38.267 --> 20:40.701
Hey, Bob, you don't happen
to have anything for frostbite

20:40.734 --> 20:42.100
in your medicine chest, do you?

20:42.133 --> 20:44.501
I'll get you
some socks.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.868
Thanks.

20:46.901 --> 20:48.901
Okay, Alex, you
have one chance

20:48.934 --> 20:50.234
to explain this to me.

20:50.267 --> 20:51.400
Huh?

20:51.434 --> 20:54.267
No, Elaine, I was, uh,
I just had trouble sleeping

20:54.300 --> 20:56.100
so I thought
I'd take a little walk.

20:56.133 --> 21:00.601
And you guys are only
26 blocks away, so...

21:00.634 --> 21:04.000
I lost my slippers
in a snowbank, see?

21:04.033 --> 21:06.167
Here you go.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.868
Bobby?
Oh, thanks.

21:07.901 --> 21:09.167
That telephone call
a few minutes ago,

21:09.200 --> 21:12.434
that was to Sergeant Preston
of the Yukon, right?

21:12.467 --> 21:14.434
Elaine, Elaine, we were
very worried about you.

21:14.467 --> 21:17.100
I mean, you're in a very
vulnerable frame of mind.

21:17.133 --> 21:18.601
That's right, Elaine.

21:18.634 --> 21:21.334
So you thought you'd save me
from myself, is that it?

21:21.367 --> 21:23.701
Well, Bobby,
you've succeeded in making fools

21:23.734 --> 21:25.100
out of all three of us.

21:25.133 --> 21:27.334
You know something?

21:27.367 --> 21:30.601
I really resent the implication
that I'd lose control of myself

21:30.634 --> 21:33.067
just because I'm an emotional
female at a weak moment,

21:33.100 --> 21:34.367
and you're a guy.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.767
A great-looking guy.

21:37.801 --> 21:41.000
Women always lose control--
is that it?

21:41.033 --> 21:42.367
But men are always
on top of things.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.300
Well, Bobby,

21:44.334 --> 21:45.767
I hate you for this tonight.

21:45.801 --> 21:47.767
And, Alex, I really resent you!

21:47.801 --> 21:50.000
I might have expected
this kind of attitude
from Bobby,

21:50.033 --> 21:52.467
but I thought
you had a little more class.

21:52.501 --> 21:53.534
Yeah, Alex.

21:53.567 --> 21:55.534
What?

21:55.567 --> 21:57.567
What is it, Alex,
a rule with you?

21:57.601 --> 21:59.701
You only get involved
in other people's lives

21:59.734 --> 22:01.234
if you can make
a complete ass of yourself?

22:01.267 --> 22:03.567
Well, I wouldn't call
it a rule.

22:03.601 --> 22:06.667
It's just the way
it happens to turn out.

22:06.701 --> 22:08.734
Look, I wouldn't be here
in the first place

22:08.767 --> 22:10.033
if you hadn't made

22:10.067 --> 22:11.367
that stupid
phone call.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.901
Hey, hold it.
You're the one that told me

22:12.934 --> 22:15.133
she was gonna be coming on
to me tonight like a Mack truck!

22:15.167 --> 22:16.734
I never said anything
like a truck.

22:16.767 --> 22:17.734
You said something...

22:17.767 --> 22:19.734
Look, I thought
that you'd only get upset

22:19.767 --> 22:21.334
if something
was really happening.

22:21.367 --> 22:22.567
Something <i>was</i> really happening.

22:22.601 --> 22:23.567
Like what?

22:23.601 --> 22:25.334
She was walking around here

22:25.367 --> 22:28.834
in loose clothes, sipping wine
and talking about love.

22:28.868 --> 22:32.634
Bobby, the pope does that.

22:32.667 --> 22:33.901
( <i>sighs</i> )

22:33.934 --> 22:36.734
Oh...

22:36.767 --> 22:40.734
Listen, I, uh...

22:40.767 --> 22:43.033
I think I'd better go.

22:44.033 --> 22:46.434
Sorry about your door.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.434
Alex,

22:49.467 --> 22:51.901
you can't go out
like that again.

22:51.934 --> 22:54.067
You might as well
just stay here.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.734
Okay.

22:58.767 --> 23:00.200
Elaine,

23:00.234 --> 23:01.334
would it be any better

23:01.367 --> 23:03.000
if Alex promised not to be
this stupid again?

23:03.033 --> 23:05.868
Come on,
will you?

23:05.901 --> 23:07.200
Look, Elaine,
the only reason

23:07.234 --> 23:08.434
that we were this stupid

23:08.467 --> 23:10.200
is because we really
care about you.

23:10.234 --> 23:14.467
Well, then
you two must care a <i>lot.</i>

23:16.501 --> 23:19.701
Well, I guess it has been

23:19.734 --> 23:22.934
kind of a rough week
for all of us, you know?

23:22.968 --> 23:24.801
Yeah, you can say that.

23:24.834 --> 23:26.934
I mean, I lost a boyfriend.

23:26.968 --> 23:29.033
I lost my job in Florida.

23:29.067 --> 23:32.434
I lost the feeling
in eight of my toes.

23:40.067 --> 23:42.601
( <i>theme music playing</i> )

24:07.033 --> 24:08.601
WOMAN:
Night, Mr. Walters.
