WEBVTT

00:55.680 --> 01:00.018
The Wrath of Khan.

01:03.354 --> 01:05.231
<i>Opens at a theater near you…</i>

01:05.315 --> 01:07.817

<i>There used to be a clear distinction</i>

01:07.901 --> 01:09.903
<i>between films and television.</i>

01:09.986 --> 01:11.237
There she is!

01:13.114 --> 01:14.199
<i>You went to the movies</i>…

01:14.866 --> 01:16.367
<i>with comfy chairs…</i>

01:17.285 --> 01:18.745
<i>air conditioning,</i>

01:18.828 --> 01:21.206
<i>and that ever-present sticky soda floor.</i>

01:22.749 --> 01:25.710
<i>Shrouded in darkness,</i>
<i>you forgot the outside world.</i>

01:26.878 --> 01:28.713
<i>And you gave yourself up to a story.</i>

01:30.632 --> 01:32.425
<i>Carlton's on the basketball team?</i>

01:33.593 --> 01:35.929
<i> Television, on the other hand,</i>
<i>came to you.</i>

01:36.846 --> 01:40.266
<i>You stayed at home, in the living room,</i>
<i>surrounded by your everyday life.</i>

01:43.228 --> 01:44.354
<i>You had control.</i>

01:45.563 --> 01:46.564
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:46.648 --> 01:50.110
<i> To change the channel,</i>
<i>turn up the volume, go get a snack.</i>

01:59.452 --> 02:01.496
<i>And the TV would still be going</i>
<i>when you got back.</i>

02:03.581 --> 02:05.291
<i>But then something changed.</i>

02:05.792 --> 02:08.253
<i>And the lines</i>
<i>between the two started to blur</i>…

02:09.254 --> 02:11.172
<i>making it harder to tell them apart.</i>

02:11.256 --> 02:15.426
I don't go to the movies much.
If you've seen one, you've seen them all.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.680
<i> So what exactly is the difference</i>
<i>between film and television?</i>

02:18.763 --> 02:20.306
<i>TV rots your brains.</i>

02:20.390 --> 02:21.891

<i>What do they offer to you?</i>

02:21.975 --> 02:23.893
<i>Our impulses are being redirected.</i>

02:23.977 --> 02:26.604
<i> And what are they asking</i>
<i>from you in return?</i>

02:28.231 --> 02:31.526
<i>To answer that, we need to go</i>
<i>back to where it all began.</i>

02:31.609 --> 02:34.612
<i>Hi, there.</i>
<i>I want to talk to you about ducts.</i>

02:35.530 --> 02:37.782
-What else is on?
-Let's see what else is on.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.201
<i> For the first half</i>
<i>of the twentieth century,</i>

02:40.285 --> 02:43.246
<i>film was the dominant</i>
<i>form of entertainment in the US.</i>

02:43.329 --> 02:45.874
<i>Across the nation,</i>
<i>three out of every four Americans</i>

02:45.957 --> 02:49.210
<i>see a moving picture once a week,</i>
<i>in 18,000 movie houses.</i>

02:49.294 --> 02:51.963
<i> But after World War II,</i>
<i>a new invention emerged,</i>

02:52.046 --> 02:55.925
<i>which meant, for the first time,</i>
<i>movies had a direct competitor.</i>

02:56.009 --> 02:57.719
<i>American television,</i>

02:57.802 --> 03:00.180
<i>the world's biggest theater,</i>
<i>with daily audience…</i>

03:00.263 --> 03:02.265

<i>So studios needed to convince the public</i>

03:02.348 --> 03:04.100
<i>why it was better to leave the house.</i>

03:06.978 --> 03:08.980
<i>They adapted successful books,</i>

03:09.063 --> 03:10.148
<i>plays,</i>

03:10.231 --> 03:11.274
<i>and Broadway shows.</i>

03:11.357 --> 03:13.067


03:14.235 --> 03:17.197
<i>They reinvested in theaters</i>
<i>to make them more upscale.</i>

03:17.280 --> 03:18.823
<i>Today, more than ever before,</i>

03:18.907 --> 03:22.035
<i>audiences appreciate</i>
<i>surroundings of luxury.</i>

03:22.118 --> 03:23.995
<i>And they introduced new technology.</i>

03:24.579 --> 03:28.041
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is Cinerama.</i>

03:28.124 --> 03:29.709


03:29.792 --> 03:31.336

<i>First came Cinerama</i>

03:31.419 --> 03:32.879
<i>and other forms of widescreen.</i>

03:32.962 --> 03:33.796
<i>Then there was…</i>

03:33.880 --> 03:37.300
3D, stereophonic sound, and Technicolor.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.385
<i>…special engagements, 70 millimeter,</i>

03:39.469 --> 03:40.511
<i>Smell-o-vision.</i>

03:40.595 --> 03:42.847
<i>All of these changes came so quickly</i>

03:42.931 --> 03:46.434
<i>and at such scale that even</i>
<i>the movies themselves took note.</i>

03:46.893 --> 03:50.104


03:50.188 --> 03:53.566


03:56.861 --> 03:59.822


03:59.906 --> 04:01.449


04:01.532 --> 04:04.244


04:04.327 --> 04:07.497
<i> It was an arms race to make film</i>
<i>look better, sound better,</i>

04:07.580 --> 04:10.500
<i>be better than the television</i>
<i>sitting in your living room.</i>

04:11.292 --> 04:12.293
<i>And it worked.</i>

04:12.877 --> 04:14.337
<i>Can you read this?</i>

04:15.380 --> 04:17.715
<i>Well, it's pretty hard, that far away.</i>

04:18.258 --> 04:20.260
<i>Early TV was not a new form of the movies.</i>

04:20.343 --> 04:23.179
<i>It was a radio with pictures.</i>

04:23.263 --> 04:25.890
<i>And, like radio,</i>
<i>it was sold as a piece of furniture.</i>

04:25.974 --> 04:29.560
You can tune in this wonderful
new Westinghouse television set

04:29.644 --> 04:31.312
with just one hand, like this.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.815
<i> The first TV networks</i>
<i>were all radio networks,</i>

04:33.898 --> 04:36.651
<i>and they carried over the same</i>
<i>way of doing business.</i>

04:36.734 --> 04:39.570
<i>Shows were free</i>
<i>because they were funded by advertisers.</i>

04:39.654 --> 04:43.116
<i>Oh dear, I see the actors</i>
<i>won't be ready for another 60 seconds.</i>

04:43.199 --> 04:46.619
<i>However, thanks to our sponsors'</i>
<i>remarkable foresight,</i>

04:46.703 --> 04:49.914
<i>we have a message</i>
<i>that will fit in here nicely.</i>

04:49.998 --> 04:54.252
<i>Maxwell House Coffee</i>
<i>tastes as good as it smells, every time.</i>

04:54.335 --> 04:56.379

<i>In exchange, TV shows needed to build</i>

04:56.462 --> 04:58.631
<i>an ongoing relationship with the audience.</i>

04:58.715 --> 05:02.719
<i>By offering a new episode every week,</i>
<i>they made tuning in a ritual.</i>

05:02.802 --> 05:06.264
<i>Ricky, wait a minute,</i>
<i>let's not watch television tonight.</i>

05:06.347 --> 05:08.099
<i>-Not watch television?</i>
<i>-Not watch television?</i>

05:10.643 --> 05:12.103
<i>What else is there to do?</i>

05:12.186 --> 05:15.231
<i> TV episodes were structured</i>
<i>around commercial breaks.</i>

05:15.315 --> 05:18.484
<i>Just like radio programs,</i>
<i>every few minutes there would be a joke</i>

05:18.568 --> 05:21.738
<i>or a cliffhanger to keep people</i>
<i>interested through the advertisements.</i>

05:21.821 --> 05:23.156
<i>Somebody's still in this building.</i>

05:27.201 --> 05:29.037

<i>Television succeeded because audiences</i>

05:29.120 --> 05:30.913
<i>fell in love with favorite characters.</i>

05:30.997 --> 05:32.248
<i>They were like family,</i>

05:32.332 --> 05:33.249
<i>friends,</i>

05:33.333 --> 05:34.625
<i>or coworkers.</i>

05:34.709 --> 05:38.046
<i>Great TV shows understood that,</i>
<i>once an audience was invested,</i>

05:38.129 --> 05:41.007
<i>even the smallest triumphs</i>
<i>could feel significant.</i>

05:41.090 --> 05:42.633
Pam. Sorry.

05:43.509 --> 05:44.510
Um…

05:44.594 --> 05:45.887
Are you free for dinner tonight?

05:47.055 --> 05:48.097
Yes.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.349
All right.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.433
Then it's a date.

05:56.981 --> 05:59.901
<i> And with syndication,</i>
<i>if a show got to a hundred episodes,</i>

05:59.984 --> 06:02.278
<i>it could be resold</i>
<i>to another network again</i>…

06:02.862 --> 06:04.364
<i>and again, and again.</i>

06:05.198 --> 06:08.701
<i>Theoretically, there are some</i>
<i>shows that could be on the air forever.</i>

06:18.419 --> 06:20.922
<i> By contrast,</i>
<i>what was special about the movies</i>

06:21.005 --> 06:24.384
<i>was the feeling of being taken</i>
<i>into a fully immersive world.</i>

06:26.844 --> 06:31.224
<i>It's an experience</i>
<i>that is often described as cinematic.</i>

06:33.643 --> 06:37.814
<i>Think of cinema as a language with its own</i>
<i>unique vocabulary and grammar.</i>

06:38.398 --> 06:39.690
<i>It can be minimalistic…</i>

06:40.400 --> 06:42.068
<i>or extravagant,</i>

06:42.151 --> 06:43.653
<i>realistic,</i>

06:43.736 --> 06:44.862
<i>or surreal.</i>

06:45.738 --> 06:48.658
<i>But for many years,</i>
<i>feature films were more fluent</i>

06:48.741 --> 06:50.451
<i>in the language than television.</i>

06:50.535 --> 06:52.120
<i>Here's a great example.</i>

06:52.203 --> 06:55.581
<i>The same story made twice</i>
<i>by the same filmmaker.</i>

06:55.665 --> 06:56.916
<i>Once for television…</i>

07:01.796 --> 07:04.090
<i>and six years later as a feature film.</i>

07:19.021 --> 07:23.192
<i>Even on the most superficial level,</i>
<i>the TV version is more limited.</i>

07:23.276 --> 07:25.945
<i>The lighting is flatter,</i>
<i>the backgrounds are less detailed,</i>

07:26.028 --> 07:28.072
<i>and every scene</i>
<i>feels like it's done in close-up.</i>

07:28.739 --> 07:31.868
<i>Notice how every shot</i>
<i>conveys a single piece of information,</i>

07:31.951 --> 07:34.120
<i>usually placed near the center of frame.</i>

07:36.706 --> 07:38.791
<i>But the feature film</i>
<i>had more time and money.</i>

07:39.375 --> 07:42.378
<i>The lighting is more dynamic.</i>
<i>The backgrounds are richly textured,</i>

07:42.462 --> 07:45.006
<i>and the compositions</i>
<i>are given room to breathe.</i>

07:45.715 --> 07:48.759
<i>This opens up the film,</i>
<i>allowing us to experience moments</i>

07:48.843 --> 07:50.761
<i>purely through image and sound.</i>

08:01.230 --> 08:03.733
<i>Let's take a look</i>
<i>at the famous diner scene.</i>

08:03.816 --> 08:08.070
<i>In the TV version, notice how the editing</i>
<i>follows the actor who is speaking.</i>

08:08.154 --> 08:09.614
What are you, a monk?

08:11.282 --> 08:12.116
No.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.161
I got a woman.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.829
What do you tell her?

08:16.913 --> 08:18.873
I tell her I sell swimming pools.

08:19.457 --> 08:23.002
<i>In the movie, the editing often lingers</i>
<i>on the actor while they're listening…</i>

08:23.628 --> 08:28.216
<i>because it's the reactions that are given</i>
<i>the weight of importance, not the words.</i>

08:29.342 --> 08:30.384
What are you, a monk?

08:31.761 --> 08:32.678
I have a woman.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.680
What do you tell her?

08:37.517 --> 08:38.726
I tell her I'm a salesman.

08:43.981 --> 08:45.858
<i>Movies were expected to have more depth,</i>

08:45.942 --> 08:50.404
<i>to be more cinematic, not just because</i>
<i>they had more money and resources…</i>

08:54.700 --> 08:57.787
<i>…but because they could use more</i>
<i>of the vocabulary</i> <i>and grammar</i>

08:57.870 --> 08:59.121
<i>of the language.</i>

08:59.205 --> 09:03.209
<i>The cinematic language of the TV version</i>
<i>tended to be very literal,</i>

09:03.292 --> 09:06.963
<i>which meant lots of talking</i>
<i>and lots of close-ups.</i>

09:07.046 --> 09:08.881
<i>-What the hell's the matter with you?</i>

09:09.757 --> 09:12.718
<i>Why'd you fall for this, huh?</i>
<i>You were free like a bird.</i>

09:12.802 --> 09:15.471
<i> But the feature film</i>
<i>was allowed to be more figurative.</i>

09:15.555 --> 09:18.391
<i>It was able to create moments</i>
<i>that said it all</i>

09:18.474 --> 09:20.268
<i>without needing to say a word.</i>

09:34.115 --> 09:36.409
<i>And for 50 years,</i>
<i>that was the dividing line.</i>

09:36.993 --> 09:39.412
<i>A movie was a cinematic experience</i>
<i>in a theater.</i>

09:39.996 --> 09:43.165
<i>A TV show was a weekly ritual</i>
<i>in the comfort of your own home.</i>

09:44.208 --> 09:45.209
<i>Every once in a while,</i>

09:45.293 --> 09:48.129
<i>something would come along</i>
<i>and blur the boundaries between the two.</i>

09:48.212 --> 09:49.088
<i>It's Laura.</i>

09:50.256 --> 09:52.758
<i>But the hierarchy was firmly established.</i>

09:54.135 --> 09:56.220
<i>And that's the way things stayed.</i>

10:00.850 --> 10:01.767
<i>Until one day…</i>

10:05.605 --> 10:10.109
<i>a premium cable network made a crime</i>
<i>drama about an Italian-American family.</i>

10:12.820 --> 10:15.281
The Sopranos <i>was</i>
<i>in the right place at the right time.</i>

10:15.364 --> 10:16.657
<i>It was cinematic.</i>

10:17.950 --> 10:20.161
<i>-It attracted talented performers.</i>

10:20.244 --> 10:24.081
<i>And it was able to sustain</i>
<i>a serialized story for almost a decade.</i>

10:24.874 --> 10:27.043
<i>Most importantly,</i>
<i>unlike network television,</i>

10:27.126 --> 10:30.713
<i>there were no worries about advertisers</i>
<i>getting squeamish over public opinion…</i>

10:30.796 --> 10:36.552
The very idea ABC would even think of
producing that stereotypical goombah fest.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.262
Fucking kill you! What are you…

10:38.346 --> 10:41.349
<i> …because HBO's economic model</i>
<i>was based on subscriptions.</i>

10:41.432 --> 10:43.601
<i>And the Emmy goes to…</i>

10:45.728 --> 10:48.856
<i> As </i>The Sopranos<i> was showered</i>
<i>with awards and critical acclaim,</i>

10:48.939 --> 10:52.610
<i>HBO gained prestige</i>
<i>and more paying customers,</i>

10:52.693 --> 10:54.904
<i>which meant other networks had to compete…</i>

10:58.949 --> 11:02.745
<i>because now there was an audience</i>
<i>that was hungry for ambitious television.</i>

11:02.828 --> 11:05.998
As of this moment, we are at war.

11:06.082 --> 11:09.168
<i>While all of this was happening on screen</i>
<i>behind the scenes,</i>

11:09.251 --> 11:11.545
<i>the digital revolution was taking place.</i>

11:11.629 --> 11:13.881
The great switchover
to digital television…

11:13.964 --> 11:15.257
<i>On August 31st…</i>

11:15.341 --> 11:16.926
We will officially make the switch.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.053
…only through a digital signal.

11:19.136 --> 11:20.429
<i>For most of its lifespan,</i>

11:20.513 --> 11:22.890
<i>television was transmitted</i>
<i>over the airwaves based on</i>

11:22.973 --> 11:25.309
<i>analog standards like NTSC or PAL,</i>

11:25.393 --> 11:27.603
<i>which meant at home, you are watching</i>

11:27.687 --> 11:30.231
<i>a lower resolution version</i>
<i>of the true image.</i>

11:31.399 --> 11:34.402
<i>Meanwhile, movies were shot</i>
<i>and shown on film,</i>

11:34.485 --> 11:37.321
<i>which for years was the highest</i>
<i>resolution available.</i>

11:44.412 --> 11:46.956
<i>But within 20 years,</i>
<i>both television and movies</i>

11:47.039 --> 11:48.874
<i>switched their entire pipelines</i>
<i>to digital…</i>

11:49.417 --> 11:53.129
<i>which meant that the two mediums</i>
<i>started to look more and more alike.</i>

11:53.212 --> 11:57.091
<i>We live in a world where</i>
<i>movie theaters face more competition.</i>

11:57.174 --> 11:58.676
<i>People not coming to the movies…</i>

11:58.759 --> 11:59.802
…really struggling…

11:59.885 --> 12:02.638
<i>…keep theaters competitive</i>
<i>with streaming options.</i>

12:02.722 --> 12:05.349
<i>Just like in the 1950s, the movie industry</i>

12:05.433 --> 12:08.519
<i>needed to convince the public</i>
<i>why it was better to leave the house.</i>

12:11.355 --> 12:14.942
<i>So they relied on the same method</i>
<i>that worked so well before, because…</i>

12:15.025 --> 12:18.988


12:19.071 --> 12:19.905
Special glasses!

12:19.989 --> 12:21.574
-<i>4DX!</i>
-<i>Artisan popcorn.</i>

12:21.657 --> 12:23.409
<i>-Nice little dinner.</i>
-<i>IMAX</i>.

12:23.492 --> 12:25.077
-<i>Alcohol.</i>
-<i>Luxury seating.</i>

12:25.161 --> 12:26.245
<i>Laser projection.</i>

12:33.836 --> 12:36.297
<i>And this time, it didn't work.</i>

12:36.881 --> 12:39.175
<i>People still lined up at theaters,</i>
<i>but increasingly,</i>

12:39.258 --> 12:42.386
<i>it was only for blockbusters</i>
<i>that relied on spectacle.</i>

12:42.470 --> 12:44.346
<i>Plenty of others stayed at home…</i>

12:44.430 --> 12:46.223
What happened to the movies?

12:46.307 --> 12:49.185
First, they got worse than TV,
and now this!

12:52.146 --> 12:53.689
<i>…where they had a front-row seat</i>

12:53.773 --> 12:56.066
<i>to the showdown happening</i>
<i>on the small screen.</i>

12:56.150 --> 12:57.568
Get down off your horse.

12:57.651 --> 12:58.986
Please lower your blaster.

12:59.069 --> 13:00.738
I admire a man with confidence.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.823
I don't see no sweat
on your brow neither, bro.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.325
You wanna dance?

13:05.367 --> 13:06.285
Let's dance.

13:08.120 --> 13:08.954
The fuck?

13:09.038 --> 13:11.624
You are up to no good, obviously.

13:12.750 --> 13:13.834
What the hell are you doing?

13:13.918 --> 13:18.255

That is how an RBMK reactor core explodes.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.341


13:25.179 --> 13:26.972
<i>On that superficial level,</i>

13:27.056 --> 13:29.725
<i>movies and television</i>
<i>looked more similar than ever.</i>

13:31.143 --> 13:33.687
<i>But there is still</i>
<i>a fundamental difference.</i>

13:34.897 --> 13:39.109
<i>Take a look at two stories about the same</i>
<i>subject written by the same writer.</i>

13:39.610 --> 13:40.569
<i>Once as a film…</i>

13:42.363 --> 13:43.572
<i>and again, as a series.</i>

13:46.909 --> 13:49.829
The Queen<i> tells a complete story</i>
<i>over the course of 90 minutes.</i>

13:49.912 --> 13:53.082
<i>It quickly sets up the main character,</i>
<i>the major events…</i>

13:53.165 --> 13:57.044
Diana, Princess of Wales,
has died after a car crash in Paris.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.254
<i>…and the theme of the film.</i>

13:58.337 --> 14:01.173
-He's going to try and modernize us?
-I wouldn't put it past him.

14:01.257 --> 14:05.427
<i> After that, every scene exists</i>
<i>to relate back to the Queen or Tony Blair.</i>

14:05.511 --> 14:08.097
If you imagine I'm going to drop
everything and come down to London

14:08.180 --> 14:11.225
before I attend to my grandchildren,
who've just lost their mother…

14:13.310 --> 14:14.144
then you're mistaken.

14:15.437 --> 14:18.399
The Crown<i>, on the other hand,</i>
<i>is a serialized long-form story.</i>

14:18.482 --> 14:21.443
<i>Each episode has a different focus</i>
<i>but a similar format.</i>

14:21.527 --> 14:22.611
<i>There is a crisis,</i>

14:22.695 --> 14:24.238
<i>a meeting with the Prime Minister,</i>

14:24.321 --> 14:26.824
<i>and the question of what this means</i>
<i>for the monarchy.</i>

14:26.907 --> 14:29.910
I was a similar age to you when your
great-grandmother, Queen Mary,

14:29.994 --> 14:31.287
told me that to do nothing…

14:31.370 --> 14:33.205
…is the hardest job of all.

14:33.289 --> 14:37.668
People will always want you to smile
or agree or frown, and the…

14:37.751 --> 14:40.796
…minute that we do,
we will have declared a position.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.758
<i> The crux of the feature film</i>
<i>is that the filmmakers only get one chance</i>

14:44.842 --> 14:49.221
<i>and a set amount of time to tell a story,</i>
<i>so they have to make every moment count.</i>

14:49.930 --> 14:53.267
<i>Everything we see on screen,</i>
<i>even if it's pure subtext…</i>

14:56.937 --> 14:59.064
<i>is there to enrich</i>
<i>the character's journey.</i>

14:59.899 --> 15:02.776
<i>If we compare</i>
<i>the beginning of the film to the end,</i>

15:02.860 --> 15:06.071
<i>we see a change in the characters</i>
<i>that might seem surprising…</i>

15:06.155 --> 15:08.198
But I can see that the world has changed<i>…</i>

15:09.450 --> 15:10.284
and one must…

15:11.619 --> 15:12.620
modernize.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.705
<i>…but was, in fact, inevitable.</i>

15:14.788 --> 15:17.207
Well, perhaps that's where I can help.

15:19.585 --> 15:23.130
<i>The essence of the series is that</i>
<i>there are many chances to tell a story.</i>

15:23.213 --> 15:25.507
<i>Each episode may follow a format,</i>

15:25.591 --> 15:28.218
<i>but this allows for a multitude</i>
<i>of ideas or characters</i>

15:28.302 --> 15:31.639
<i>to weave in and out</i>
<i>of the larger tapestry of the show.</i>

15:32.181 --> 15:36.560
<i>A minor character in one story</i>
<i>can be the central focus in another.</i>

15:36.644 --> 15:38.395
And no one wants you to be you.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.563
They want you to be it.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.066
A statue. A thing.

15:42.149 --> 15:45.444
The Crown.
That's what they've come to see, not you.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.279
<i>This is how TV works.</i>

15:47.363 --> 15:50.908
<i>Many glimpses of a character that allow</i>
<i>the audience to explore different facets</i>

15:50.991 --> 15:54.036
<i>of their personality</i>
<i>over a longer period of time.</i>

15:54.119 --> 15:56.121
Television is good for normal people.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.957
But that was the whole point,

15:58.040 --> 16:01.335
to show everyone that behind palace gates
we are perfectly normal people.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.629
No, ma'am. You are not normal.

16:03.712 --> 16:06.131
<i> So if you want a single,</i>
<i>standalone experience</i>

16:06.215 --> 16:09.343
<i>that gives you a definitive ending,</i>
<i>watch the movie.</i>

16:09.426 --> 16:13.263
<i>If you want many little stories</i>
<i>that build on each other over time,</i>

16:13.347 --> 16:14.348
<i>watch the show.</i>

16:14.431 --> 16:17.851
Perhaps you might comment
on what's on the television.

16:17.935 --> 16:22.606
<i>It would be easier if there was something</i>
<i>remotely amusing to watch.</i>

16:22.690 --> 16:24.191
<i>I agree. This is deathly.</i>

16:26.235 --> 16:28.904
<i>So what does all of this mean</i>
<i>for you, the viewer?</i>

16:31.490 --> 16:33.033
<i>Movies ask for a lot upfront.</i>

16:35.703 --> 16:38.664
<i>Going to the movies is a night out,</i>
<i>and not a cheap one at that.</i>

16:42.876 --> 16:45.421
<i>But for your time and undivided attention…</i>

16:45.921 --> 16:49.842
<i>the film agrees to give you a streamlined</i>
<i>and heightened experience.</i>

16:50.342 --> 16:53.262
<i>It promises an ending</i>
<i>that will leave you with lasting memories</i>

16:53.345 --> 16:55.389
<i>of a world you briefly visited.</i>

16:57.057 --> 16:58.851
<i>Television asks for less upfront.</i>

16:59.476 --> 17:02.980
<i>One episode isn't very long,</i>
<i>and you don't need to leave your couch.</i>

17:03.605 --> 17:06.025
<i>But the smaller investment</i>
<i>grows over time.</i>

17:06.108 --> 17:08.402
<i>You expect to care about these characters</i>

17:08.485 --> 17:11.655
<i>and to become more deeply invested</i>
<i>with every episode.</i>

17:11.739 --> 17:14.533
<i>There's nothing in the world more</i>
<i>powerful than a good story.</i>

17:14.616 --> 17:18.245
<i>The trade-off is that you might</i>
<i>not get an ending that satisfies you.</i>

17:18.328 --> 17:19.705
<i>And who has a better story…</i>

17:21.165 --> 17:22.416
<i>than Bran the Broken?</i>

17:27.046 --> 17:30.758
<i> For over 70 years,</i>
<i>each medium has vied for your attention.</i>

17:30.841 --> 17:35.262
<i>But maybe it's time for the discussion</i>
<i>between movies and TV to be reframed.</i>

17:36.680 --> 17:39.308
<i>From the world's greatest</i>
<i>library of film classics…</i>

17:39.391 --> 17:41.268
<i>At the end of the day, what really matters</i>

17:41.351 --> 17:43.687
<i>are the stories that capture</i>
<i>your imagination…</i>

17:45.606 --> 17:48.317
<i>in whatever form they happen to come in.</i>
