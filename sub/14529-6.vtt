00:05.739 --> 00:11.176
(narrator)
Previously on "The Making
of the Mob: New York"...

00:11.178 --> 00:13.645
(man screaming)

00:13.647 --> 00:15.414
After rising in
the ranks of

00:15.416 --> 00:18.017
the New York underworld
for two decades,

00:18.019 --> 00:20.586
Charles "Lucky" Luciano
makes a decision

00:20.588 --> 00:22.087
that could
bring down the Mafia...

00:22.089 --> 00:23.355
(Thomas Dewey)
Mr. Luciano.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.490
(narrator)
...when he takes the stand

00:24.492 --> 00:26.025
in his own defense

00:26.027 --> 00:28.427
against special prosecutor
Thomas Dewey.

00:28.429 --> 00:31.330
Do you really expect
this jury to believe

00:31.332 --> 00:34.099
that you are telling
the truth?

00:34.101 --> 00:35.401
They believe what
they're led to believe!

00:37.771 --> 00:40.606
(narrator)
After Dewey puts him
away for 50 years...

00:40.608 --> 00:42.508
I gotta get
the hell out of here.

00:42.510 --> 00:46.412
...Luciano must run his crime
family from behind bars.

00:46.414 --> 00:49.615
I'm naming Vito head
of the Luciano Family.

00:49.617 --> 00:52.618
(narrator)
And he picks Vito Genovese
as his acting boss.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.453
You won't regret this.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.622
(narrator)
But Genovese lets the power
go to his head.

00:56.624 --> 00:59.525
He's greedy, he's reckless,
he's careless.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.760
(narrator)
And Luciano's empire
starts to fall apart.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.195
Unh!

01:03.197 --> 01:04.596
Who are you calling
stupid, Frank?

01:04.598 --> 01:06.398
I'll put two in your head,
you understand me?

01:06.400 --> 01:07.566
(gunshots)

01:07.568 --> 01:09.068
(narrator)
When Genovese flees

01:09.070 --> 01:10.569
the country on
murder charges...

01:10.571 --> 01:12.337
That stupid prick.

01:12.339 --> 01:16.141
...Frank Costello is named
acting boss of the family.

01:16.143 --> 01:17.810
But a snitch emerges
from within...

01:17.812 --> 01:19.311
Reles is talking,
Charlie.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.280
(Luciano)
What are you
waiting for, Frank?

01:21.282 --> 01:22.848
Get it done, now.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.217
(narrator)
...forcing Luciano
to order a hit...

01:25.219 --> 01:27.386
Reles, come check
out the view.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.354
(narrator)
...that keeps
his empire intact.

01:29.356 --> 01:30.622
<i>Salute.</i>

01:32.459 --> 01:36.095
But brings him no closer...
to freedom.

01:37.297 --> 01:41.300
¶

01:41.302 --> 01:44.336
(man)
¶ This ain't no time

01:44.338 --> 01:48.407
¶ To feel sorry
for myself ¶

01:48.409 --> 01:51.577
¶ I can't help it

01:51.579 --> 01:55.280
¶ 'Cause there's nobody else

01:55.282 --> 01:58.650
¶ And I walk these streets

01:58.652 --> 02:02.221
¶ With your name
on my tongue ¶

02:02.223 --> 02:05.257
¶ But I dare not speak

02:05.259 --> 02:10.162
¶ Only there it belongs

02:10.164 --> 02:14.533
¶ There's got to be
a better way ¶

02:14.535 --> 02:16.368
¶ Better way

02:16.370 --> 02:18.237
(gunshot echoes)

02:30.783 --> 02:32.784
(narrator)
Charles "Lucky" Luciano,

02:32.786 --> 02:35.554
the most powerful mob boss
in America,

02:35.556 --> 02:38.857
remains locked up
in a maximum security prison

02:38.859 --> 02:41.360
in upstate New York.

02:41.362 --> 02:44.897
And while he's managing to keep
his operation under control,

02:44.899 --> 02:47.299
Luciano fears
the other New York families

02:47.301 --> 02:49.735
will try to grab hold
of his power

02:49.737 --> 02:52.571
if he doesn't get out soon.

02:52.573 --> 02:56.642
A mob boss in prison probably
could maintain his position

02:56.644 --> 02:58.510
and his power for a while.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.546
But, it was always
so competitive,

03:00.548 --> 03:03.849
it was always so vicious
that eventually,

03:03.851 --> 03:06.485
there's always
somebody hungry to move up.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.957
I been in here too long.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.462
It's time for something
to happen.

03:18.631 --> 03:20.766
Charlie, what do
you want us to do?

03:22.835 --> 03:24.836
What about these whores?

03:24.838 --> 03:27.239
Can we get to them?

03:27.241 --> 03:29.341
The problem is
finding them.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.276
No one knows where
they're at, Charlie.

03:31.278 --> 03:32.878
They're in protection,
can't get to them.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.246
But we're working
on it.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.348
We got every cop
and politician

03:36.350 --> 03:37.683
paid on the street
except for Dewey.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.585
We can't find
three hookers?

03:39.587 --> 03:41.853
Is that what
you're telling me?

03:52.865 --> 03:55.300
(narrator)
On orders from Lucky Luciano,

03:55.302 --> 03:57.903
Frank Costello
and Meyer Lansky

03:57.905 --> 04:00.606
orchestrate
a nationwide search

04:00.608 --> 04:03.942
for the prostitutes whose
testimony put Luciano in jail.

04:03.944 --> 04:08.513
¶

04:16.322 --> 04:18.590
It's only
a matter of time

04:18.592 --> 04:20.459
before their efforts
pay off.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.793
Hello?

04:42.448 --> 04:43.749
Good job.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.459
(Ellen Poulsen)
After the trial,

04:54.461 --> 04:59.298
three of the prostitutes
escaped to California

04:59.300 --> 05:01.867
where they thought they were
going to live free and clear.

05:05.371 --> 05:06.938
Florence Newman?

05:06.940 --> 05:08.640
Cokey!

05:08.642 --> 05:10.776
(footsteps approaching)

05:14.380 --> 05:16.682
(Ellen Poulsen)
Unfortunately, Lucky's men

05:16.684 --> 05:20.385
more or less kidnapped
the prostitutes.

05:20.387 --> 05:24.323
They were taken to a law office
and told to sign a paper

05:24.325 --> 05:27.492
that stated they had
lied during the trial.

05:28.961 --> 05:30.962
(narrator)
Thomas Dewey isn't about
to let his case

05:30.964 --> 05:33.065
against Luciano fall apart.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.069
So he takes matters
into his own hands.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.339
(Thomas Dewey III)
There were allegations

05:40.341 --> 05:43.442
that there'd been some sort of
improper conduct

05:43.444 --> 05:45.811
in securing some
of the testimony.

05:48.381 --> 05:50.682
Clearly, what had happened
is that

05:50.684 --> 05:53.485
the mob had gotten
to some of the witnesses

05:53.487 --> 05:55.821
and gotten them
to flip their stories.

05:58.925 --> 06:02.928
It is difficult to imagine

06:02.930 --> 06:07.766
the paralyzing fear expressed
by nearly every witness

06:07.768 --> 06:12.037
in this case at the prospect
of testifying against a man

06:12.039 --> 06:17.609
as ruthless and as violent
as Lucky Luciano.

06:19.412 --> 06:23.081
Lucky Luciano is the ruler of
the most powerful

06:23.083 --> 06:28.086
criminal organization this city,
this country, has ever known.

06:28.088 --> 06:34.559
These witnesses were abused
and exploited young women

06:34.561 --> 06:37.529
who were coerced
into selling their bodies

06:37.531 --> 06:40.399
to satisfy the lusts
of depraved men,

06:40.401 --> 06:46.872
while Lucky Luciano and
his gang got rich off of it.

06:46.874 --> 06:50.475
My office acted only
to protect these women

06:50.477 --> 06:53.445
so that they could tell
the truth

06:53.447 --> 06:56.047
and escape the horrific life

06:56.049 --> 06:59.885
Lucky Luciano
had subjected them to.

07:04.891 --> 07:09.594
(narrator)
Dewey convinces the judge
to dismiss the allegations,

07:09.596 --> 07:13.565
and Lucky Luciano's appeal
is denied.

07:18.771 --> 07:22.574
Lucky Luciano has bribed judges
and juries,

07:22.576 --> 07:25.744
intimidated witnesses
and attempted to play

07:25.746 --> 07:28.647
the legal system in his favor.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.783
But all of his efforts
have failed.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.453
He's now faced
with the realization

07:34.455 --> 07:38.056
that he might spend the rest
of his life behind bars.

07:39.559 --> 07:42.561
(indistinct officer chatter)

07:42.563 --> 07:44.763
See, this one, these dates
are not matching up.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.798
Make sure you get
the dates to match, please.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.768
(narrator)
After ensuring Luciano
remains locked up...

07:50.870 --> 07:52.704
Thomas Dewey sets
his sights

07:52.706 --> 07:56.608
on his next target
in organized crime,

07:56.610 --> 07:59.678
one of the founding members
of Murder, Inc.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.882
(gunshots)

08:03.884 --> 08:07.552
For years, the highly trained
group of assassins...

08:09.555 --> 08:13.124
has worked
for the New York Mafia,

08:13.126 --> 08:16.695
carrying out hits approved
by the Commission

08:16.697 --> 08:19.498
without leaving a trace.

08:19.500 --> 08:24.536
But when hit man Abe Reles
is tied to a murder in 1940,

08:24.538 --> 08:27.172
he starts ratting out members
of Murder, Inc.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.175
I'll give you 50 guys.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.810
(narrator)
Before the Mafia
takes him out,

08:31.812 --> 08:34.713
Reles names one of the
hit squad's top killers...

08:34.715 --> 08:36.181
Louis Lepke.

08:37.016 --> 08:40.151
Lepke has evaded the law for
nearly two years.

08:40.153 --> 08:43.889
The feared Jewish gangster has
a garment industry racket

08:43.891 --> 08:48.760
worth the modern-day equivalent
of over $17 million per year.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.062
Louis Lepke lived in a big,
fancy apartment

08:51.064 --> 08:52.631
on the Upper West Side.

08:52.633 --> 08:56.601
He lived in the equivalent of
The Dakota.

08:56.603 --> 08:59.871
Lepke, however,
had a real bad temper.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.041
And he would do things
himself.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.143
(gunshot)

09:10.783 --> 09:13.752
(narrator)
Thomas Dewey believes if he can
gather enough evidence

09:13.754 --> 09:17.556
and pin murder charges
on Lepke,

09:17.558 --> 09:20.926
he'll be able to bring down
the rest of Murder, Inc.

09:26.032 --> 09:27.766
(Thomas Dewey)
How many witnesses?

09:27.768 --> 09:30.201
We have seven witnesses
ready to testify.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.904
All right.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.340
Issue the charges.
Yes, sir.

09:38.711 --> 09:41.713
(narrator)
Dewey orders his men
to sweep the city.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.782
But with the mob's
connections

09:43.784 --> 09:47.118
and hideouts
throughout New York,

09:47.120 --> 09:50.355
the professional assassin
disappears.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.361
While Dewey's men search
for Lepke...

09:58.097 --> 10:00.131
the Federal Bureau
of Investigation

10:00.133 --> 10:02.334
is also looking
to arrest him

10:02.336 --> 10:04.769
on a separate
narcotics charge.

10:06.839 --> 10:11.276
And the FBI joins in
on the international manhunt.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.179
(Rich Cohen)
Lepke spent about a year
in hiding where

10:14.181 --> 10:16.815
there was a search for him
all over the world.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.651
People saw him in Australia,
Hawaii, South America.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.119
Turned out he was
in a basement apartment

10:21.121 --> 10:22.754
in Brooklyn
the entire time.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.658
(narrator)
Before the authorities
can find him,

10:26.660 --> 10:28.793
Lepke begins to take out

10:28.795 --> 10:31.396
anyone who could connect him
to a murder.

10:35.868 --> 10:40.672
Lepke had this philosophy,
no witness, no case.

10:40.674 --> 10:41.973
He was killing everybody...
(man grunting)

10:41.975 --> 10:44.376
...and he was psychotic,
and he was crazy.

10:44.378 --> 10:46.645
And the feeling was if you
hang around long enough,

10:46.647 --> 10:48.013
Lepke will kill you, too.

11:01.127 --> 11:03.995
The longer Louis Lepke
remains at large,

11:03.997 --> 11:07.098
the more of a mockery
he's making of this agency.

11:09.869 --> 11:12.871
(narrator)
Director of the FBI,
J. Edgar Hoover,

11:12.873 --> 11:17.075
knows he could put Lepke away
for narcotics charges.

11:17.077 --> 11:20.845
But with
the gangster in hiding,

11:20.847 --> 11:23.448
he'll need the help of
an unlikely ally.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.025
You'll never guess
who I got a call from.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.061
Who?

11:36.063 --> 11:38.096
The FBI.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.233
They want us to help 'em
find Louis Lepke.

11:50.176 --> 11:51.810
(narrator)
By 1939...
Unh!

11:51.812 --> 11:54.779
...the New York Mafia's
most dangerous hit man

11:54.781 --> 11:57.449
Louis Lepke is being hunted
by the FBI

11:57.451 --> 12:01.953
on drug charges and
by Thomas Dewey for murder.

12:01.955 --> 12:05.256
Lepke has evaded the law
for nearly two years.

12:05.258 --> 12:08.827
So in a last ditch effort
to bring him in,

12:08.829 --> 12:12.030
the feds have reached out
to an unexpected ally...

12:12.032 --> 12:14.132
Lucky Luciano.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.468
(Joe Mantegna)
Luciano was approached
by our government,

12:16.470 --> 12:17.969
there was that whole thing
of some--

12:17.971 --> 12:19.237
Every once in a while,
the two sides

12:19.239 --> 12:20.772
try to do
something together

12:20.774 --> 12:22.307
for the benefit
of everyone.

12:28.247 --> 12:32.884
(narrator)
Luciano was serving the third
year of his 50-year sentence

12:32.886 --> 12:34.853
and has tried everything
to get out.

12:36.155 --> 12:38.356
Now with the FBI asking
for help,

12:38.358 --> 12:42.060
he sees the opportunity
he's been looking for

12:42.062 --> 12:46.331
and meets with his closest
advisor, Meyer Lansky.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.834
What do you wanna do
about it?

12:51.270 --> 12:53.004
Maybe you could
talk to Lepke.

12:56.375 --> 12:59.344
You tell him...

12:59.346 --> 13:02.113
he's gotta take...

13:02.115 --> 13:04.115
the rap
on the heroin.

13:05.885 --> 13:08.186
We give him over
to Hoover...

13:10.389 --> 13:12.490
and he'll pin the murders
on him, too.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.392
Then he goes away
forever,

13:14.394 --> 13:17.996
and we buy favor
with Hoover and Dewey.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.801
Notorious killer,
Louis Lepke

13:22.803 --> 13:27.005
put away
by J. Edgar Hoover.

13:27.007 --> 13:31.509
(narrator)
Luciano knows that giving up
Lepke would be a huge gamble,

13:31.511 --> 13:35.947
as the feared killer
could easily snitch on the mob.

13:35.949 --> 13:39.217
But for the criminal kingpin,
getting out of prison

13:39.219 --> 13:40.819
and reclaiming his place

13:40.821 --> 13:43.888
at the head of his family
is more important.

13:45.858 --> 13:48.459
In the fall of 1939,

13:48.461 --> 13:51.496
Luciano and Lansky
set a plan in motion

13:51.498 --> 13:54.332
to double-cross
Louis Lepke.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.534
(Rich Cohen)
After Lucky Luciano
went to jail,

13:56.536 --> 14:00.338
Meyer Lansky's power had to
become more Machiavellian.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.374
He had to work the angles,
pit people against people.

14:03.376 --> 14:06.945
And I think that he really
wanted to get Luciano

14:06.947 --> 14:09.848
out of prison because
I think that the best days

14:09.850 --> 14:11.916
of his life were when
Luciano was

14:11.918 --> 14:14.319
on the street
and they were together.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.054
(narrator)
If they can convince Lepke

14:16.056 --> 14:19.357
to turn himself in
on lesser drug charges,

14:19.359 --> 14:23.061
the feds will hand him over
to Dewey for murder,

14:23.063 --> 14:26.264
giving Luciano the leverage
he thinks he needs

14:26.266 --> 14:28.266
to get out of prison.

14:33.906 --> 14:37.275
(dog barking)

14:37.277 --> 14:39.377
(knocking at door)

14:39.379 --> 14:41.112
(narrator)
To carry out the plan,

14:41.114 --> 14:45.250
Lansky sends Lepke's
trusted associate...

14:45.252 --> 14:48.553
Murder, Inc. co-founder,
Albert Anastasia.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.522
Well, Albert,
it's been a long time.

14:58.464 --> 14:59.931
Listen, Lou,
I can help you out

14:59.933 --> 15:02.133
but you gotta
trust me on this.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.636
I don't trust anybody.

15:04.638 --> 15:07.438
We can make the Dewey
murder rap go away.

15:11.277 --> 15:12.977
How?

15:12.979 --> 15:14.646
The FBI is how.

15:19.218 --> 15:21.085
Hoover's got you on
the high-profile list,

15:21.087 --> 15:23.454
he wants a
high-profile bust.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.291
Turn yourself in to Hoover
on the heroin thing,

15:26.293 --> 15:28.326
two, three years
in the can, tops.

15:30.162 --> 15:32.030
The FBI?

15:32.032 --> 15:35.066
If Dewey's guys find you
hiding out here,

15:35.068 --> 15:37.568
they're gonna throw you
right in the electric chair.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.637
Use your head.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.340
It's a good deal,
Lou.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.457
(Rich Cohen)
Lepke wanted to
surrender himself

15:59.459 --> 16:01.092
to the federal government.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.394
He didn't want the New York
police to get him

16:03.396 --> 16:05.330
and end up in
the electric chair.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.341
You got Lepke?

16:34.326 --> 16:38.363
(narrator)
Because of the high-profile
nature of the arrest,

16:38.365 --> 16:42.367
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover
personally wants

16:42.369 --> 16:46.671
to bring the most wanted man
in America into custody.

16:48.440 --> 16:53.177
Louis Lepke, you're under
arrest for murder.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.313
Murder? You didn't
say anything about--

16:55.315 --> 16:57.081
Albert, what is this?!
What is this?!

16:57.083 --> 16:59.384
Bastard!
What the-- Ah!

16:59.386 --> 17:01.019
Get your hands
off me!

17:01.021 --> 17:03.021
Filthy pigs!

17:03.023 --> 17:07.091
¶

17:09.328 --> 17:11.496
(narrator)
After a two-year search,

17:11.498 --> 17:15.600
J. Edgar Hoover
finally has his man...

17:15.602 --> 17:18.302
thanks to Lucky Luciano.

17:18.304 --> 17:22.340
(Sonny Grosso)
Lucky Luciano, he understood
that in life

17:22.342 --> 17:24.542
if I really help you out,
that when you see

17:24.544 --> 17:26.811
an opportunity,
you'll look out for me.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.479
Well, that's what this
is all about.

17:30.282 --> 17:33.317
(narrator)
In addition to gaining leverage
with the FBI,

17:33.319 --> 17:36.421
Luciano's
just given Thomas Dewey

17:36.423 --> 17:39.323
a huge victory.

17:39.325 --> 17:43.261
And on December 2, 1941,

17:43.263 --> 17:47.265
Louis Lepke
is sentenced to death.

17:47.267 --> 17:50.501
(Rich Cohen)
Hoover turned him right back
to Dewey and Dewey executed him.

17:50.503 --> 17:56.107
Louis Lepke, only mob boss
to ever be executed.

17:56.109 --> 17:59.610
(narrator)
Dewey has taken down another
high-profile gangster,

17:59.612 --> 18:03.381
and under a national spotlight,
he launches a campaign

18:03.383 --> 18:05.783
to become the next
governor of New York.

18:11.123 --> 18:13.324
Luciano's certain
if Dewey wins,

18:13.326 --> 18:17.195
he'll sign a pardon
freeing him from prison.

18:17.197 --> 18:20.198
But while he waits for word
from Dewey,

18:20.200 --> 18:24.235
a violent attack
almost 5,000 miles away

18:24.237 --> 18:26.838
is about to change everything.

18:26.840 --> 18:32.743
(President Franklin Roosevelt)
<i>Yesterday, December 7, 1941,</i>

18:32.745 --> 18:36.814
<i>a date which will live</i>
<i>in infamy.</i>

18:44.123 --> 18:45.156
(soldiers shouting
sounds of battle)

18:45.158 --> 18:47.291
(narrator)
For three years,

18:47.293 --> 18:50.661
the violent conflict has been
raging throughout Europe.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.134
(H.W. Brands)
During most of the 1930s,

18:56.136 --> 18:58.136
Americans had ignored what
was going on in Europe

18:58.138 --> 19:01.539
as Hitler ramped up and
began rampaging around Europe.

19:01.541 --> 19:05.309
Until Pearl Harbor.

19:05.311 --> 19:09.680
(President Roosevelt)
<i>A date which will live</i>
<i>in infamy.</i>

19:13.519 --> 19:18.222
(narrator)
While Lucky Luciano is in
prison in upstate New York,

19:18.224 --> 19:22.260
the country braces for another
attack on American soil,

19:22.262 --> 19:25.263
and New York could be
the first target.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.898
(H.W. Brands)
It was known that there were
German submarines

19:26.900 --> 19:29.200
that were prowling
along American shores.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.469
And the United States didn't
have the naval force yet

19:31.471 --> 19:33.304
to counteract that.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.773
So Americans
were deeply concerned.

19:45.484 --> 19:50.488
(narrator)
Just two months after the attack
on Pearl Harbor...

19:50.490 --> 19:53.357
America's worst fear
is realized

19:53.359 --> 19:57.228
as a massive fire breaks out
on a naval troop ship on

19:57.230 --> 19:59.897
the docks along
the West Side of Manhattan.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.538
As the "SS Normandie" burns,

20:07.540 --> 20:12.410
fear spreads that war
has reached New York City.

20:16.548 --> 20:21.752
(Selwyn Raab)
The government was very worried
about sabotage

20:21.754 --> 20:23.754
on the waterfront.

20:25.691 --> 20:27.558
The government couldn't
figure out what to do

20:27.560 --> 20:30.695
until someone suggested
get to the union leaders

20:30.697 --> 20:33.631
and get to the mob guys
who really run the waterfront.

20:38.637 --> 20:40.438
(narrator)
Since Prohibition,

20:40.440 --> 20:45.610
organized crime has asserted
its power over New York's harbor

20:45.612 --> 20:48.546
and now has control over
more than 200 ports.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.415
(gulls squawking)

20:51.417 --> 20:53.884
Now at war,

20:53.886 --> 20:56.254
the federal government
is forced to make

20:56.256 --> 20:58.322
another unlikely alliance.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.760
The Mafia's control
and their affiliations

21:02.762 --> 21:05.396
with the Longshoreman's Union
meant

21:05.398 --> 21:06.897
that they had
a hand in everything

21:06.899 --> 21:08.566
coming into the country.

21:08.568 --> 21:11.602
And the government
had to reach out to the Mafia

21:11.604 --> 21:15.339
to prevent sabotage
on the waterfront.

21:15.341 --> 21:17.642
And they had to reach out
to Lucky Luciano.

21:33.925 --> 21:37.295
Mr. Lansky,
we need your help.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.032
Well, listen, sir,
just because

21:41.034 --> 21:44.935
we're, um, businessmen,

21:44.937 --> 21:47.371
doesn't mean
we're not patriots.

21:50.342 --> 21:51.876
We'll lock down the docks.

21:51.878 --> 21:54.445
Nothing gets in or out
of New York harbor

21:54.447 --> 21:55.946
without us knowing
about it.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.915
Nothing.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.950
Thank you.

21:59.952 --> 22:02.053
Don't thank me.

22:02.055 --> 22:04.755
Thank Lucky Luciano.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.727
(Selwyn Raab)
Now this is an example
of how powerful

22:09.729 --> 22:12.997
by 1941
the American Mafia was.

22:16.001 --> 22:19.737
(narrator)
Lansky reports back to Luciano
with a deal.

22:19.739 --> 22:22.373
In exchange
for the mob's help,

22:22.375 --> 22:24.108
the navy agrees to work
to reduce

22:24.110 --> 22:26.377
Luciano's prison sentence.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.924
With Luciano calling the shots
from prison,

22:39.926 --> 22:45.830
Meyer Lansky and Frank Costello
orchestrate a citywide plan,

22:45.832 --> 22:49.734
paying heavily-armed guards
to work around the clock

22:49.736 --> 22:53.871
and putting a system in place
to keep track of all shipments

22:53.873 --> 22:56.874
so that nothing gets in or out
of New York

22:56.876 --> 22:59.043
without the Mafia's approval.

23:01.012 --> 23:06.617
When you hear that Lucky helped
the American government

23:06.619 --> 23:11.021
protect the New York harbors
from prison,

23:11.023 --> 23:15.059
how could you dislike a guy
who protected New York City?

23:16.695 --> 23:19.964
¶

23:22.134 --> 23:24.435
(Michael Green)
Mobsters can be patriots.

23:24.437 --> 23:26.537
They're human beings like
the rest of us.

23:26.539 --> 23:30.040
And there are these stories
that Lucky and other mobsters

23:30.042 --> 23:33.077
helped keep the docks clean.

23:33.079 --> 23:36.447
Well, why not?
They're Americans, too.

23:36.449 --> 23:40.117
At the same time, being
intelligent businesspeople,

23:40.119 --> 23:41.986
there is an element
in their thinking,

23:41.988 --> 23:44.989
"If I do this for my government,
the government

23:44.991 --> 23:48.159
might do something
for me down the line, too."

23:53.765 --> 23:57.735
(narrator)
While Luciano is doing his part
in the American war effort...

23:59.871 --> 24:02.573
4,000 miles away...

24:06.011 --> 24:11.549
Vito Genovese is about
to strike a deal...

24:11.551 --> 24:13.617
with the enemy.

24:19.558 --> 24:23.127
(narrator)
After feeling to Italy to escape
a murder charge,

24:23.129 --> 24:27.565
Vito Genovese has been forced
to abandon his dream

24:27.567 --> 24:31.035
of ruling
the Luciano crime family.

24:31.037 --> 24:34.171
¶

24:43.148 --> 24:47.685
Now, Genovese is determined
to exploit a new opportunity.

24:53.592 --> 24:56.093
But before he can lay
the groundwork,

24:56.095 --> 24:58.529
he'll need
to go through one man,

24:58.531 --> 25:01.999
fascist dictator,
Benito Mussolini.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.234
Sir.

25:21.219 --> 25:23.654
Just a small sample.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.656
(narrator)
Over the next few years,
Genovese

25:25.658 --> 25:29.760
donates the modern-day
equivalent of $3.6 million

25:29.762 --> 25:32.162
to Mussolini's fascist party.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.632
There's plenty more
where that came from.

25:40.805 --> 25:43.941
(Selwyn Raab)
What Genovese did
in a very patriotic mode,

25:43.943 --> 25:47.711
he became an arch-fascist
in support of Mussolini

25:47.713 --> 25:50.114
while he was in Italy during
the entire war.

25:50.116 --> 25:53.284
In fact, he made major
contributions.

25:53.286 --> 25:55.886
So, there was no question.
He had suddenly forgotten

25:55.888 --> 25:58.689
all about
his American patriotism.

26:00.759 --> 26:03.827
(church bell ringing)

26:07.098 --> 26:10.100
(narrator)
With the dictator on his side,
Genovese has the freedom

26:10.102 --> 26:13.103
to set up a lucrative racket

26:13.105 --> 26:16.273
in an industry
he's known for years.

26:16.275 --> 26:20.778
Vito Genovese was involved
in the heroin trade.

26:20.780 --> 26:24.048
You go all the way back
to the early days,

26:24.050 --> 26:26.116
then he was
moving opium around.

26:26.118 --> 26:31.188
(narrator)
In the 1940s,
heroin is legal in Italy.

26:31.190 --> 26:35.225
And Mussolini allows Genovese
to export narcotics freely...

26:37.162 --> 26:40.798
smuggling drugs out of
the country in small packages,

26:40.800 --> 26:44.868
disguised in luggage
and automobiles.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.137
For almost a year,

26:47.139 --> 26:50.741
Genovese builds up his heroin
racket throughout Italy.

26:50.743 --> 26:54.078
(plane engine purring)

26:54.080 --> 26:57.915
But in July of 1943,

26:57.917 --> 27:00.918
in the midst
of the global war,

27:00.920 --> 27:03.354
the Allies invade Sicily.

27:03.356 --> 27:06.991
¶

27:13.932 --> 27:18.102
(Selwyn Raab)
There has been a lot of reports
that Luciano was helpful

27:18.104 --> 27:23.140
in the invasion of Sicily
in 1943, and that's a myth.

27:23.142 --> 27:26.310
Luciano, through his
own public relations efforts,

27:26.312 --> 27:28.679
tried to create the myth

27:28.681 --> 27:31.215
that would help him get
the pardon from Dewey.

27:31.217 --> 27:35.686
In fact, Frank Costello
tipped off Walter Winchell,

27:35.688 --> 27:39.056
a very important columnist,
and Winchell reported this,

27:39.058 --> 27:42.359
that Luciano helped
the invasion of Sicily.

27:42.361 --> 27:44.728
Total fabrication.

27:44.730 --> 27:48.365
(narrator)
The Allied invasion of Sicily
is a success.

27:48.367 --> 27:52.069
And so is Luciano's play
for public goodwill.

27:59.377 --> 28:02.680
As the Allies
sweep across Italy,

28:02.682 --> 28:05.683
Genovese is suddenly
on the losing side.

28:05.685 --> 28:08.018
He quickly switches
his allegiance,

28:08.020 --> 28:11.889
and becomes a translator
for the American army.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.361
Guys, what's going
on here?

28:17.363 --> 28:19.396
These crates have
been here for weeks.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.231
(narrator)
But true to form,

28:21.233 --> 28:24.401
Genovese betrays
his new allies.

28:24.403 --> 28:26.904
When the Americans come
and take over Sicily,

28:26.906 --> 28:29.173
he disavows the fascists

28:29.175 --> 28:32.042
and he cuts a deal with
the American army.

28:32.044 --> 28:36.080
And then we find out that
he's diverting illegal supplies

28:36.082 --> 28:39.883
from the American army to sell
on the black market.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.019
This was a guy that
would cut a deal with anybody,

28:42.021 --> 28:43.320
and then betray them.

28:43.322 --> 28:47.324
Come on, let's go!
We can move faster.

28:47.326 --> 28:50.327
During World War Two,
Genovese just capitalized

28:50.329 --> 28:53.230
on food stamps,
the rationing stamps,

28:53.232 --> 28:56.767
uh, whether it was gasoline.

28:56.769 --> 28:59.903
Many of the mob guys
were excitement junkies, uh,

28:59.905 --> 29:03.774
addicted to certain types of,
you know, behavior,

29:03.776 --> 29:06.844
whether it was stealing, power.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.246
(Genovese)
We gotta paint them and get 'em

29:09.248 --> 29:11.815
out of here, all right?

29:11.817 --> 29:13.951
Leave this warehouse clear.

29:17.822 --> 29:19.423
Freeze!
Freeze!

29:19.425 --> 29:21.959
Don't move,
don't move, don't move!

29:25.263 --> 29:27.064
(soldier)
Get up, move!

29:27.066 --> 29:29.266
(Chazz Palminteri)
The real smart guys,
they know

29:29.268 --> 29:31.101
not to mess
with the government.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.070
This wiseguy once
told me, he said,

29:33.072 --> 29:35.072
"Chazz, one thing
you don't do.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.406
"You don't mess
with the government.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.776
They got the toughest mob
in the world."

29:38.778 --> 29:40.110
To the right,
you understand me?

29:40.112 --> 29:41.345
(Chazz Palminteri)
They won two world wars

29:41.347 --> 29:42.813
and they print
their own money.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.148
You don't mess with them.

29:46.050 --> 29:49.920
(narrator)
Once Genovese is in army
custody, the military learns

29:49.922 --> 29:52.523
that he's wanted for murder
in the U.S.

29:52.525 --> 29:56.160
and quickly sends him back
to New York to stand trial.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.498
With two of the most powerful
gangsters

30:01.500 --> 30:05.169
in the Luciano
crime family behind bars,

30:05.171 --> 30:08.238
the fate of the operation
is at stake.

30:13.511 --> 30:16.513
And Lucky Luciano begins
to realize

30:16.515 --> 30:19.349
that if Genovese
turns on the mob,

30:19.351 --> 30:22.286
he could once again
risk everything

30:22.288 --> 30:25.022
Luciano's worked
so hard to build.

30:37.001 --> 30:39.036
(narrator)
After seven years
on the lam in Italy...

30:39.038 --> 30:42.206
Vito Genovese
is in federal custody

30:42.208 --> 30:44.474
and on his way back
to America

30:44.476 --> 30:47.911
facing the murder charge
he tried to dodge.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.627
Frank?

31:03.629 --> 31:05.963
That murder charge?

31:05.965 --> 31:08.599
The D.A.'s
got a witness.

31:08.601 --> 31:11.101
Some guy named
Pete LaTempa.

31:12.904 --> 31:14.438
It's true, Vito.

31:16.174 --> 31:18.175
He's gonna testify.

31:19.344 --> 31:21.445
How could you be
so stupid?

31:30.488 --> 31:33.390
You gotta get
to this guy, Frank.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.326
If he talks,
I'm done.

31:41.966 --> 31:46.169
(narrator)
The man with evidence against
Genovese is Peter LaTempa,

31:46.171 --> 31:50.941
a low-level gangster willing
to exchange his testimony

31:50.943 --> 31:53.010
to reduce his sentence.

32:00.551 --> 32:02.386
This is not good.

32:02.388 --> 32:03.921
Doing the best I can.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.989
It's not good enough,
Frank.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.226
What are we gonna do?

32:11.963 --> 32:16.466
(narrator)
To Luciano, Genovese has been
a liability for years,

32:16.468 --> 32:20.971
failing as a boss and
drawing attention to the mob.

32:20.973 --> 32:24.007
Now, if Genovese snitches
to the feds,

32:24.009 --> 32:27.678
he could destroy everything
Luciano has built.

32:27.680 --> 32:31.114
(Richard Hammer)
During the war, Genovese
was working with Mussolini.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.717
Luciano was a patriot.

32:33.719 --> 32:36.019
And Luciano hated him.

32:36.021 --> 32:38.522
If he could have,
he would have had him killed.

32:39.724 --> 32:41.325
(narrator)
Despite their differences,

32:41.327 --> 32:43.260
Luciano knows he
and Genovese

32:43.262 --> 32:45.395
have built
a criminal empire together,

32:45.397 --> 32:49.199
and he refuses to turn his back
on one of his inner circle.

32:56.975 --> 33:00.377
(guard)
LaTempa, it's time
for your daily dose.

33:19.697 --> 33:22.165
(groaning)

33:24.535 --> 33:27.070
(coughing)

33:36.114 --> 33:40.083
(narrator)
On January 15, 1945,

33:40.085 --> 33:43.487
Pete LaTempa is found poisoned
in his cell.

33:44.655 --> 33:47.724
Lucky Luciano
has saved Vito Genovese.

33:50.328 --> 33:51.795
And without a key witness,

33:51.797 --> 33:54.464
the feds may
no longer have a case.

33:59.670 --> 34:03.273
Just four months later,

34:03.275 --> 34:05.342
the Allies declare victory
in Europe.

34:08.246 --> 34:10.414
And soon after,
victory in Japan.

34:13.618 --> 34:16.686
After six long years of fighting
across the globe,

34:16.688 --> 34:18.789
World War Two is finally over.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.799
And now, Luciano wants
to make sure the valuable help

34:28.801 --> 34:33.570
he's given to the war effort
doesn't go unrewarded.

34:33.572 --> 34:36.807
(Richard Hammer)
Luciano thought of himself
as an American patriot.

34:36.809 --> 34:40.577
The United States was getting
lots and lots of assistance

34:40.579 --> 34:43.313
from Luciano,
and he thought that

34:43.315 --> 34:46.316
as a reward for his service
in World War Two,

34:46.318 --> 34:50.253
he would be allowed
to resume his power.

34:50.255 --> 34:53.723
(narrator)
Luciano drafts a letter pleading
his case for parole.

34:55.626 --> 34:57.494
He addresses it to
the one man with the power

34:57.496 --> 34:59.463
to grant him clemency,

34:59.465 --> 35:02.466
New York's
newly-elected governor,

35:02.468 --> 35:07.838
the man responsible for putting
Luciano in prison, Thomas Dewey.

35:07.840 --> 35:11.741
But Dewey has no reason
to grant Luciano a pardon

35:11.743 --> 35:14.277
and every reason to keep him
behind bars.

35:19.851 --> 35:23.353
Five months go by without word
from Dewey.

35:24.889 --> 35:28.625
By now, Luciano has been in
prison for nearly ten years.

35:30.828 --> 35:35.899
The entire time, he's been
scheming to find a way out.

35:35.901 --> 35:37.467
(Michael Green)
Lucky wants out of jail.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.469
He wants to go back
to making money

35:39.471 --> 35:41.605
and running
his organized crime syndicate.

35:43.407 --> 35:48.645
Lucky Luciano is willing
to do anything to stay in power.

35:50.515 --> 35:53.517
(narrator)
In his quest to gain
his freedom,

35:53.519 --> 35:57.721
Luciano has done favors
for the FBI,

35:57.723 --> 36:01.491
the United States Navy,
and even Thomas Dewey.

36:03.928 --> 36:08.765
But with no response
to his quest for parole,

36:08.767 --> 36:11.701
it seems it's all been
for nothing.

36:23.581 --> 36:28.251
(narrator)
In 1945, Lucky Luciano sent
a letter requesting parole

36:28.253 --> 36:32.189
to New York's governor,
Thomas Dewey.

36:33.524 --> 36:38.328
It's been seven months
and still no response.

36:39.263 --> 36:41.531
When will we know?

36:43.467 --> 36:45.468
Well, that's up to Dewey.

36:45.470 --> 36:48.471
Soon, Charlie,
I'll push it, soon.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.474
I've been talking
to my guys in the Navy,

36:51.476 --> 36:54.611
and they're leaning on him
real hard.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.914
That doesn't mean
he's gonna sign it.

37:01.552 --> 37:04.487
All we can do is try
to push all the right buttons

37:04.489 --> 37:06.590
and hope for the best.

37:15.266 --> 37:19.369
¶

37:19.371 --> 37:22.572
(narrator)
With Luciano's request for
a pardon in hand,

37:22.574 --> 37:25.909
Thomas Dewey must make
a crucial decision.

37:25.911 --> 37:27.611
He's built
his political career

37:27.613 --> 37:30.480
on the back of Luciano's
conviction.

37:30.482 --> 37:32.282
But now,
he's getting pressure

37:32.284 --> 37:35.252
to free Luciano from
the United States Navy.

37:39.624 --> 37:41.291
Pressure was put on Dewey

37:41.293 --> 37:44.594
because of Luciano's
war service,

37:44.596 --> 37:46.696
which was extensive.

37:46.698 --> 37:51.568
(narrator)
But Luciano's work on behalf of
the military is classified.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.903
If Dewey does pardon Luciano,

37:53.905 --> 37:57.440
he won't be able
to reveal the reason.

37:57.442 --> 38:00.510
And for a politician with
presidential aspirations,

38:00.512 --> 38:03.346
releasing America's
most notorious gangster

38:03.348 --> 38:06.049
could be a major liability.

38:06.051 --> 38:08.585
The commutation
of Luciano's sentence was

38:08.587 --> 38:12.422
a politically controversial
issue at the time.

38:12.424 --> 38:17.294
And it was a difficult one
for him politically.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.529
(narrator)
With pressure mounting
on all sides,

38:19.531 --> 38:21.765
Thomas Dewey comes up with
a solution

38:21.767 --> 38:25.535
to appease the military,
protect his political future,

38:25.537 --> 38:28.571
and deal with Luciano
once and for all.

38:29.974 --> 38:34.644
(indistinct shouting)

38:45.323 --> 38:48.391
I, uh, came as soon as
I got word.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.095
Dewey signed
the papers.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.364
But, um...

38:58.936 --> 39:00.537
You can't stay here.

39:04.442 --> 39:06.509
They're deporting you.

39:09.380 --> 39:11.614
To Italy.

39:18.089 --> 39:19.956
I'm an American.

39:24.929 --> 39:27.397
(Thomas Dewey III)
Based on the help that Luciano

39:27.399 --> 39:31.568
had given to the government
during the war,

39:31.570 --> 39:34.371
my grandfather
commuted his sentence

39:34.373 --> 39:36.406
with the additional condition
that he be deported

39:36.408 --> 39:38.475
and not return
to the United States.

39:41.011 --> 39:42.912
I guess
I'll go back.

39:49.653 --> 39:53.089
¶

40:03.000 --> 40:06.636
(narrator)
After ten years, Luciano has
finally won his freedom.

40:12.743 --> 40:15.478
But it's come
at a steep price.

40:22.853 --> 40:25.922
(ship's horn blaring)

40:32.997 --> 40:36.166
For the first time since
his incarceration,

40:36.168 --> 40:38.968
Luciano's original crew
is together again.

40:45.042 --> 40:49.979
Benny, you came all this way
to see me go.

40:49.981 --> 40:52.882
Had to say good-bye.

40:57.655 --> 41:00.557
Francesco.
Charlie.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.992
I just got word.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.728
The D.A.'s gonna drop
the charges against Vito.

41:05.730 --> 41:07.530
He's being released.

41:08.466 --> 41:11.034
Just keep
an eye on him.

41:11.036 --> 41:12.569
(ship's horn blowing)

41:18.676 --> 41:19.943
Meyer.

41:25.082 --> 41:27.016
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you, too.

41:27.952 --> 41:29.586
Come visit me
sometime, huh?

41:32.022 --> 41:33.590
(bell clanging)

41:33.592 --> 41:37.060
¶

41:39.797 --> 41:43.233
(narrator)
40 years after he arrived
in New York,

41:43.235 --> 41:46.870
a penniless immigrant
from Sicily,

41:46.872 --> 41:49.572
Lucky Luciano
is being forced to leave

41:49.574 --> 41:51.941
the country he considers home.

41:53.978 --> 41:56.946
Luciano thought of himself
as an American.

41:56.948 --> 41:58.681
This is where
he had made it.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.583
This is where he wanted
to be.

42:00.585 --> 42:03.119
And he thought
that he would be allowed

42:03.121 --> 42:07.090
to stay here and resume
his power.

42:07.092 --> 42:09.759
(narrator)
Luciano and his crew
have climbed their way

42:09.761 --> 42:12.195
to the top of
the New York underworld,

42:12.197 --> 42:15.832
amassed a fortune most men
can only dream of,

42:15.834 --> 42:19.068
and built
a criminal empire together.

42:20.538 --> 42:25.742
Now, Lucky Luciano must
leave it all behind.
