<i>the teen years-- clothes may change,</i>

00:06.697 --> 00:09.832
<i>The hair may change,
what part of the body gets pierced</i>

00:09.833 --> 00:12.902
<i>May change, but one thing
doesn't change--teenagers suck.</i>

00:12.903 --> 00:16.038
<i>The crying, the mood swings,
the unpredictable behavior...</i>

00:16.039 --> 00:18.708
Axl, you better get up,
or you're gonna miss the bus!

00:18.709 --> 00:21.778
I am not telling you again! Get up,
get up, get up!

00:21.779 --> 00:23.112
Hey.

00:23.113 --> 00:26.048
You're up. Yeah, I got up early,
I am not telling you again! Get up, get up,
get up!

00:26.049 --> 00:29.285
I just thought I'd take
the trash out to the curb.

00:29.286 --> 00:31.988
Got the paper for you.
That's a pretty blouse, mom.

00:31.989 --> 00:34.857
<i>Like I said--</i>

00:34.858 --> 00:36.793
<i>Unpredictable behavior.</i>

00:36.794 --> 00:38.861
okay, I'll search his backpack.

00:38.862 --> 00:42.431
You go over there and very
casually check his breath.

00:42.432 --> 00:44.433
okay, don't look,

00:44.434 --> 00:46.903
But he's actually pouring
cereal into a bowl.

00:46.904 --> 00:48.638
I said don't look.

00:48.639 --> 00:52.441
What's his game?

00:52.442 --> 00:54.443
You know what? He's 16 now.

00:54.444 --> 00:57.380
Maybe we're through the worst
of the teen crap with him.

00:57.381 --> 01:01.083
Maybe he's grown up.
Maybe things are finally about to get

01:01.084 --> 01:03.986
A little easier around here now. Oh!

01:03.987 --> 01:06.522
I can't go to school today!
My hair is stringy,

01:06.523 --> 01:08.958
My face is too oval, and I have no friends.

01:08.959 --> 01:12.361
Honey, we all have those days.

01:12.362 --> 01:15.131
Why don't you take a sick day?
It'll be our little secret.

01:15.132 --> 01:19.068
And not see my friends? Yeah,
great idea, mom!

01:19.069 --> 01:22.905
God! It's like you don't
even understand me at all.

01:24.508 --> 01:27.043
Okay, I'll tell 'em.

01:27.044 --> 01:29.912
Aunt edie and aunt ginny are
on the smoking bus to vegas,

01:29.913 --> 01:35.284
And they forgot to get
someone to watch doris.

01:35.285 --> 01:37.553
I'll do it.

01:37.554 --> 01:40.556
How about one of the guys at the quarry?
I suppose I could ask.

01:40.557 --> 01:43.359
I'll do it. Or their creepy
neighbor with the glass eye?

01:43.360 --> 01:45.494
Thought he was dead. I'll do it!

01:45.495 --> 01:47.630
No, brick, I don't think you will do it.

01:47.631 --> 01:51.000
Why not? Why can't I?
Give me one good reason.

01:51.001 --> 01:54.203
<i>Actually, we could give him a
whole lot of good reasons.</i>

02:07.851 --> 02:09.985
<i>I am dead. </i>

02:11.455 --> 02:15.324
Please, can I watch her?
Doris is the most fun dog ever.

02:15.325 --> 02:18.761
<i>doris is not the most fun dog ever.</i>

02:18.762 --> 02:20.930
Brick, the problem is
that you get distracted,

02:20.931 --> 02:23.032
And you forget stuff, and the backyard

02:23.033 --> 02:25.534
Is too frozen right now to dig a new grave.

02:25.535 --> 02:28.571
But I won't get distracted
this time. I promise.

02:28.572 --> 02:31.207
<i>The dog is pretty old.</i>

02:31.208 --> 02:34.210
She dies on brick's watc they
can't really pin it on us.

02:36.146 --> 02:41.083
Okay, against all judgment,
you can watch doris.

02:41.084 --> 02:44.954
Brick, we said okay.

02:44.955 --> 02:46.489
To what?

02:46.490 --> 02:48.424
Watching the dog.

02:48.425 --> 02:50.760
Doris. The dog.

02:50.761 --> 02:54.063
Oh, right. Great!

02:55.966 --> 02:58.935
Mom, dad.

02:58.936 --> 03:01.304
Listen, I want to talk to
you guys about something.

03:01.305 --> 03:04.373
You're gonna have to marry her,
and you can't live here.

03:04.374 --> 03:06.442
Listen, I'm 16 now,

03:06.443 --> 03:08.444
And I think we can all agree

03:08.445 --> 03:10.579
That I've proven myself to be responsible.

03:10.580 --> 03:12.448
You took out the garbage once.

03:12.449 --> 03:15.017
And I brought in the paper.

03:15.018 --> 03:17.887
So, you know, I think you
guys should consider the fact

03:17.888 --> 03:20.089
That I clearly deserve my own car.

03:20.090 --> 03:22.959
<i>And there it was-
-the reason axl was being so nice.</i>

03:22.960 --> 03:25.127
<i>See, ever since axl got
his driver's license</i>

03:25.128 --> 03:28.097
<i>A few weeks ago, he'd been
chomping at the bit to drive</i>

03:28.098 --> 03:29.966
<i>Every chance he could get.</i>

03:29.967 --> 03:32.001
I need eggs!

03:33.637 --> 03:37.306
I need milk!

03:37.307 --> 03:39.575
I need tampons!

03:43.847 --> 03:45.848
You want a car?

03:45.849 --> 03:49.085
You're gonna have to work
for it and earn it yourself.

03:49.086 --> 03:50.987
Yeah. Uh, I had a job.

03:50.988 --> 03:54.323
It sucked. But I still want a car.

03:54.324 --> 03:56.359
So you see my dilemma.

03:56.360 --> 03:59.161
Well, you know, I have a job and a car,

03:59.162 --> 04:01.097
So you see the connection.

04:04.134 --> 04:06.168
you know, if I had a car,

04:06.169 --> 04:08.537
I could take her to the insane asylum.

04:11.742 --> 04:14.844
Sue, what are you doing?

04:14.845 --> 04:17.446
All my clothes are stupid and ugly

04:17.447 --> 04:20.149
<i>And... stupid!</i>

04:20.149 --> 04:21.817
<i>She needs help.</i>

04:21.817 --> 04:24.587
<i>Where did I stash that last
bag of Halloween candy?</i>

04:24.588 --> 04:26.956
<i>Oh, right, in my mouth
during "grey's anatomy."</i>

04:26.957 --> 04:29.759
<i>I'm trying out for drama club,
and I ve nothing to wear.</i>

04:29.760 --> 04:31.060
Nothing!

04:31.061 --> 04:33.729
Drama club. Sounds about right.

04:35.766 --> 04:37.867
All right, that's enough of that.

04:37.868 --> 04:41.037
Stop crying right now.

04:41.038 --> 04:44.774
Okay, mike, why don't you just go?
I'll handle this.

04:44.775 --> 04:47.343
Honey, how about I help you find something

04:47.344 --> 04:50.279
To wear to the audition?

04:50.280 --> 04:53.649
<i>Oh, yeah, right,
like you kn what's cool.</i>

04:55.252 --> 04:59.455
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

04:59.456 --> 05:01.857
It's okay. We'll find something.

05:01.858 --> 05:06.462
Oh! Nothing that would make anybody like me.

05:06.463 --> 05:10.966
Mom, all the cool kids have
citizens of humanity jeans,

05:10.967 --> 05:13.102
And I am the only person

05:13.103 --> 05:14.937
In the entire school who doesn't.

05:14.938 --> 05:19.075
Honey, I believe that it's not
at people see on the outside

05:19.076 --> 05:20.976
That makes you popular.

05:20.977 --> 05:22.745
It's what's inside.

05:22.746 --> 05:25.681
You have to let your inner
light shine through.

05:25.682 --> 05:28.017
<i>Hold your smile. Keep eye contact.</i>

05:28.018 --> 05:30.186
<i>See if she buys it.</i>

05:30.187 --> 05:32.888
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!

05:32.889 --> 05:34.256
<i>Damn.</i>

05:34.257 --> 05:37.326
Mom, junior high is hard.

05:37.327 --> 05:39.562
People judge you for every little thing,

05:39.563 --> 05:42.465
If they even notice you at all.

05:42.466 --> 05:45.568
I just want to be judged.

05:45.569 --> 05:49.438
Didn't you ever want something
so bad that you'd die for it?

05:56.513 --> 05:59.148
I love you.

05:59.149 --> 06:02.218
Yeah, yeah. Just don't tell
your dad how much they cost.

06:05.288 --> 06:07.123
Hey, buddy.

06:07.124 --> 06:09.425
How was the first day watching the dog?

06:09.426 --> 06:12.161
Ohh.

06:12.162 --> 06:14.130
Yeah, I know, "ohh."

06:14.131 --> 06:18.467
You left her at the end of
the driveway. Go get her.

06:18.468 --> 06:21.637
Hey, brick, why is doris at the end of the--

06:21.638 --> 06:23.706
He knows. He's on it.

06:23.707 --> 06:26.175
Dad, I got new jeans.

06:26.176 --> 06:29.411
Oh, wow. I like 'em.

06:29.412 --> 06:33.983
No, not these.
These are my old, gross jeans.

06:33.984 --> 06:37.086
These! I'm gonna go try 'em on.

06:39.823 --> 06:41.524
Can I see that?

06:43.393 --> 06:45.427
Let me see that.

06:45.428 --> 06:48.097
What? It's a receipt.
So what? You don't need to see it.

06:48.098 --> 06:50.099
Is that how it is now, ricky ricardo?

06:50.100 --> 06:53.102
You have to see all my
receipts when I come home?

06:53.103 --> 06:56.071
When you dive on it like
it's a live grenade, yeah.

06:56.072 --> 06:58.174
I want to see it. You know what?
I just don't like this in principle,

06:58.175 --> 07:01.177
Because it makes me feel--well,
I'm just gonna say it, mike--

07:01.178 --> 07:05.181
Less than, and I am not less than.

07:05.182 --> 07:07.583
Let me see it. No.

07:07.584 --> 07:10.019
<i>Frankie. No.</i>

07:10.020 --> 07:12.521
All right. If you don't want me to see it,

07:12.522 --> 07:14.957
Then that's your business. Whatever.

07:14.958 --> 07:17.293
Mike! Give I give it! Give it!

07:17.294 --> 07:19.128
No, don't take that! Give me that!

07:19.129 --> 07:22.464
Get your hands out! No, don't read that.

07:22.465 --> 07:24.400
There's a present for you on there.

07:24.401 --> 07:26.802
<i>112 bucks for one pair of jeans?</i>

07:26.803 --> 07:30.039
Well, most of that is tax.
Frankie, are you kidding?

07:30.040 --> 07:32.875
Tell me there's another man
somewhere that's supporting you.

07:32.876 --> 07:35.578
Okay, mike, I know it's crazy.
It's completely crazy,

07:35.579 --> 07:40.983
But this is about sue and her self-esteem.
I just gave axl a lecture about how he's
gotta work for things,

07:40.984 --> 07:43.886
And you just waltz in and
buy her a pair of jeans

07:43.887 --> 07:46.956
That cost more than all my pants put
together? Okay, I wouldn't expect you to
understand.

07:46.957 --> 07:48.824
Good, 'cause I don't.

07:48.825 --> 07:51.193
Look, mike, I know this seems frivolous,

07:51.194 --> 07:53.762
But at her age, fitting in is important.

07:53.763 --> 07:56.298
And if I could do one
thing to help her fit in

07:56.299 --> 07:59.101
And look cool, I'm gonna help her look cool.

07:59.102 --> 08:01.804
you guys are not even gonna recognize me.

08:01.805 --> 08:06.542
So? What do you think?

08:06.543 --> 08:09.511
It's just great, honey.

08:11.781 --> 08:15.618
Yep. Money well-spent.

08:17.090 --> 08:19.625
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

08:19.626 --> 08:21.894
I did not not make drama club.

08:21.895 --> 08:25.330
Oh, well. You'll get 'em next time, honey.

08:25.331 --> 08:27.933
No, I said "not not.
" I didn't not make it yet.

08:27.934 --> 08:30.669
<i>I still almost maybe did make it.</i>

08:30.670 --> 08:32.703
I got a callback.

08:32.705 --> 08:34.840
Honey, that's great!

08:34.841 --> 08:38.844
Yeah!

08:38.845 --> 08:43.148
<i>Oh, right. The magic jeans
got her a callback.</i>

08:43.149 --> 08:45.684
No, of course not. Don't be ridiculous.

08:45.685 --> 08:47.953
The magic jeans gave her
the confidence she needed

08:47.954 --> 08:50.422
To nail the audition and get the callback.

08:50.423 --> 08:53.358
Mm. Kind of like that jersey you always wear

08:53.359 --> 08:56.295
When you watch the colts.
Well, that's not magic. That's science.

08:56.296 --> 09:00.299
Oh. Hey. I need to meet
some friends at pizza pan.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.668
Oh! Right. If someone bought me a car

09:02.669 --> 09:04.770
Like other people buy people jeans,

09:04.771 --> 09:06.638
I guess I could drive myself.

09:06.639 --> 09:09.141
But if you want to play
favorites with your kids,

09:09.142 --> 09:11.276
Then I guess I'm gonna need a ride

09:11.277 --> 09:13.579
When you guys go out tonight.

09:13.580 --> 09:15.948
Big drag for you.

09:15.949 --> 09:17.816
Also if I had my own car,

09:17.817 --> 09:19.785
I could take sue to the orthodontist

09:19.786 --> 09:22.721
And look for that dog that brick
is definitely going to lose.

09:22.722 --> 09:25.290
I mean, I'm just thinking about you.

09:25.291 --> 09:27.226
Why don't you get that?

09:37.303 --> 09:39.238
Who's that girl waving to us?

09:39.239 --> 09:40.772
Uh, it's nobody. See you later.

09:40.773 --> 09:42.674
oh, come on. Let me out.

09:42.675 --> 09:45.010
Not until you tell us who that girl is.

09:45.011 --> 09:49.548
How should I know? well,
she seems very friendly. Hi!

09:49.549 --> 09:51.650
Sure I hi, friendly stranger.

09:51.651 --> 09:53.652
Oh, god, please. Would you just stop?

09:53.653 --> 09:55.954
She's just some girl
I've kind of been seeing.

09:55.955 --> 09:59.591
Now let me out, please. See, if we had
given you a car, we would never have found
out

09:59.592 --> 10:02.160
About this friend of yours.
So what's her name?

10:02.161 --> 10:04.096
Where'd you meet her? Kate. School.

10:04.097 --> 10:06.598
She's an excellent student
and a good influence on me.

10:06.599 --> 10:09.434
Now can I get out now? Sure. Wait a minute.

10:09.435 --> 10:12.304
I think, frankie, we should meet this kate.
Definitely gotta meet her.

10:12.305 --> 10:15.140
Fine. Just don't say anything
moronic like, "nice to meet you"

10:15.141 --> 10:20.178
Or "pleasure to meet you" or...
"good to meet you." wouldn't dream of it.

10:20.179 --> 10:23.348
uh, kate, some people who gave birth to me.

10:23.349 --> 10:25.117
People, kate.

10:25.118 --> 10:28.086
It's so nice to meet you. You, too.

10:28.087 --> 10:30.989
Okay, this has been awkward. Let's go.

10:30.990 --> 10:33.225
wow.

10:33.226 --> 10:34.893
She's pretty.

10:34.894 --> 10:37.362
Boat show model-pretty.

10:37.363 --> 10:39.631
I was thinking

10:39.632 --> 10:42.834
Maybe we should, you know, buy axl a car.

10:42.835 --> 10:46.238
What? Where is this coming from?

10:46.239 --> 10:49.107
You just told him the other
day he had to work for it.

10:49.108 --> 10:51.143
Yeah, but a guy needs a car--

10:51.144 --> 10:54.046
Especially with the level
of girl he's dating.

10:54.047 --> 10:57.749
"level"? What do you mean, "level"?

10:57.750 --> 11:00.185
yeah, eventually you're gonna have to spit.

11:00.186 --> 11:03.088
Oh, my god. You want to buy axl a car

11:03.089 --> 11:05.490
Because the girl he's dating is hot.

11:05.491 --> 11:07.926
did you not hear the boy?

11:07.927 --> 11:10.996
She's also an excellent student
and a good influence on him.

11:10.997 --> 11:12.998
You are so full of it!

11:12.999 --> 11:15.634
Frankie, you can't pick up a girl like that

11:15.635 --> 11:17.302
In your parents' car.

11:17.303 --> 11:19.805
It's just not cool. Oh,
you think it's important that he be cool?

11:19.806 --> 11:22.240
Look, you don't know
what it's like for a boy.

11:22.241 --> 11:24.042
If you don't have a car, you're nothing.

11:34.354 --> 11:36.955
Oh, my god. After all the grief you gave me

11:36.956 --> 11:38.790
About those jeans...

11:38.791 --> 11:40.659
Jeans are dumb.

11:40.660 --> 11:42.928
A car is freedom.

11:42.929 --> 11:44.830
Fine. If you can find a car

11:44.831 --> 11:49.735
For the same price as those jeans,
you go for it.

11:51.738 --> 11:54.639
<i>I should have known better. </i>

11:59.812 --> 12:02.114
Oh!

12:02.115 --> 12:04.883
That cost 112 bucks?

12:04.884 --> 12:08.587
110. Keep the change.

12:08.588 --> 12:11.223
Buy yourself something pretty.

12:13.293 --> 12:14.194
<i>Well, I guess mike and I discovered</i>

12:14.195 --> 12:15.729
<i>what the rich have known all along--</i>

12:15.730 --> 12:18.465
<i>Throw money at a problem,
and it'll go away.</i>

12:18.466 --> 12:19.466
It might be the carburetor.

12:19.466 --> 12:21.701
Nah, it's gotta be the engine mounts.

12:21.702 --> 12:23.903
<i>We tighten that, you're good.
Mike and axl were getting along.</i>

12:23.904 --> 12:27.140
<i>Brick hadn't killed the dog yet.</i>

12:27.141 --> 12:29.209
Go get it, doris!

12:29.210 --> 12:31.144
Come on, doris!

12:34.315 --> 12:36.983
Get it, doris!

12:37.984 --> 12:40.752
<i>And sue was over the
moon with her new jeans.</i>

12:40.753 --> 12:43.689
<i>I thought I was handling the
teen years pretty well.</i>

12:43.690 --> 12:46.291
Hey, mom. Have you see my new jeans?

12:46.292 --> 12:48.927
I thought it would be cool
to have a fashion show

12:48.928 --> 12:51.296
After dinner, and then
everyone can vote on which top

12:51.297 --> 12:53.298
I should wear with my new jeans
to the audition next week.

12:53.299 --> 12:55.500
Yeah, I brought 'em in
here to hand wash 'em,

12:55.501 --> 12:57.636
But I haven't gotten to 'em yet.

12:57.637 --> 13:00.138
um, brick?

13:00.139 --> 13:02.608
Yeah? Missing anything?

13:02.609 --> 13:05.210
I miss grandma.

13:05.211 --> 13:07.279
Anything that goes woof?

13:09.315 --> 13:11.650
On it.

13:13.319 --> 13:15.954
The callback audition has
to be a new monologue.

13:15.955 --> 13:18.390
Do you think "the crucible" or "grease"

13:18.391 --> 13:20.325
Would show off the jeans more?

13:20.326 --> 13:24.396
<i>I was thinking I could do my hair all '50s...
I shrunk the magic jeans.</i>

13:24.397 --> 13:28.734
<i>Oh, no. God, take my jeans instead!</i>

13:28.735 --> 13:31.970
You have an audition to worry about.
You should go rest.

13:31.971 --> 13:33.705
But it's the middle of the day.

13:33.706 --> 13:36.842
Are you serious about this audition or not?

13:53.793 --> 13:55.861
<i>There was no way around it.</i>

13:55.862 --> 13:57.996
<i>I was gonna have to
tell sue the truth--</i>

13:57.997 --> 14:00.365
<i>That a burglar broke in
and stole only her jeans.</i>

14:00.366 --> 14:02.367
hi, sweetie.

14:02.368 --> 14:07.139
Mom, look. I have the same
jeans as jennifer love hewitt.

14:07.140 --> 14:08.807
Yeah.

14:08.808 --> 14:11.710
About that...

14:11.711 --> 14:13.946
Sue, I have some bad news.

14:13.947 --> 14:17.149
You know that new dryer
that we have that we found,

14:17.150 --> 14:20.052
That's just so new and so good?

14:20.053 --> 14:22.254
It's--it's really too good.

14:22.255 --> 14:23.822
What are you talking about?

14:23.823 --> 14:25.691
Honey...

14:25.692 --> 14:28.660
the dryer shrunk your jeans.

14:28.661 --> 14:29.962
What?

14:29.963 --> 14:31.897
I'm so, so sorry.

14:31.898 --> 14:33.999
I just feel terrible.

14:36.035 --> 14:38.036
That's okay.

14:38.037 --> 14:39.404
It's not your fault.

14:39.405 --> 14:41.640
I know, but I just feel horrible.

14:41.641 --> 14:44.609
Don't feel horrible. They were just jeans.

14:44.610 --> 14:47.379
And the truth is, you were right before.

14:47.380 --> 14:49.848
It really is about what's
inside that counts.

14:49.849 --> 14:52.651
I just have to let my
inner light shine through.

14:52.652 --> 14:55.921
<i>Okay, yeah. That's not
what really happened.</i>

14:55.922 --> 14:58.924
<i>How could you do this to me?
You just want to ruin my life.</i>

14:58.925 --> 15:01.059
You knew how important they were to me,

15:01.060 --> 15:03.061
And you didn't keep them safe.

15:03.062 --> 15:06.531
You don't care about anyone
but yourself! I hate you!

15:06.532 --> 15:10.902
Honey, you don't really feel that.

15:10.903 --> 15:12.904
A-a lot of that is just hormones talking.

15:12.905 --> 15:15.474
You're frustrated and disappointed,

15:15.475 --> 15:17.809
And I'm just gonna give you some space,

15:17.810 --> 15:20.312
And we'll talk about it more
when you've calmed down.

15:20.313 --> 15:22.347
<i>Okay, that didn't happen either.</i>

15:22.348 --> 15:26.952
Oh, yeah? Well, you are no
picnic to live with either!

15:26.953 --> 15:28.887
You think I don't do anything for you?

15:28.888 --> 15:30.989
Let me tell you something, missy!

15:30.990 --> 15:34.292
All I do are things for you!

15:34.293 --> 15:36.928
And right now I'm not sure it's worth it!

15:36.929 --> 15:39.297
Then leave me alone!

15:39.298 --> 15:41.666
You don't have to ask me twice.

15:41.667 --> 15:44.236
Ugh!

15:47.607 --> 15:49.808
<i>Yep, the crying, the mood swings,</i>

15:49.809 --> 15:51.743
<i>The unpredictable behavior--</i>

15:51.744 --> 15:53.812
<i>It's a tough time.</i>

15:56.852 --> 15:59.754
<i>In the next couple days,
sue and I weren't fighting anymore,</i>

15:59.755 --> 16:01.756
<i>But that's mostly 'cause
we weren't talking.</i>

16:01.757 --> 16:03.758
oh, no! I can't find the...

16:03.759 --> 16:06.394
Never mind. I got her.

16:06.395 --> 16:07.962
My bad.

16:10.898 --> 16:13.767
Hey, dad. Do you know where my lip gloss is?

16:13.768 --> 16:17.004
Uh... No.

16:17.005 --> 16:18.505
That's okay.

16:18.506 --> 16:21.842
I'll find it. Thanks, dad.

16:23.745 --> 16:26.313
<i>You want to tell me why
my daughter's asking me</i>

16:26.314 --> 16:28.982
About her lip gloss?
'cause she's still punishing me.

16:28.983 --> 16:30.817
Well, the joke's on her,

16:30.818 --> 16:35.188
'cause I know it went through
the wash with her jeans.

16:35.189 --> 16:38.292
Hey, dad, great idea
gappin' the spark plugs.

16:38.293 --> 16:41.328
She is running sweet now. You're the man!

16:41.329 --> 16:44.097
Um, so what do you think about the shirt?

16:44.098 --> 16:48.435
Am I trying too hard or...
A girl like that? You gotta try hard.

16:48.436 --> 16:50.470
you know it.

16:50.471 --> 16:52.773
Boom!

16:55.276 --> 16:57.277
He's a good kid.

16:57.278 --> 16:59.379
Shut up.

16:59.380 --> 17:02.716
I'm texting bella that you
picked me up in your own car.

17:02.717 --> 17:06.118
I'm texting bella that you
look really cute tonight.

17:06.119 --> 17:10.290
<i>I'm texting bella that I
look really cute tonight. </i>

17:12.894 --> 17:16.930
You don't have to text bella about this.

17:16.931 --> 17:19.933
Brick, dog.

17:29.344 --> 17:32.612
I gotta go pick up axl. The car broke down.

17:32.613 --> 17:34.548
Typical teenager.

17:34.549 --> 17:37.417
He probably tried to push it over 20.

17:42.824 --> 17:45.792
Way to go, dad. I told you
it was the carburetor.

17:45.793 --> 17:47.828
he's so lame.

17:47.829 --> 17:50.931
It's not the carburetor. you don't know.
You don't know anything.

17:50.932 --> 17:53.767
he doesn't know anything.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.770
Axl, watch it. I was justrying to help.

17:56.771 --> 17:59.573
So I'm texting bella that
your dad is dropping us off

17:59.574 --> 18:02.709
At the movies. I'm texting
bella that your dad is tall.

18:02.710 --> 18:06.079
tall and clueless.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.482
Okay.

18:08.483 --> 18:10.250
Here we are.

18:10.251 --> 18:12.486
This is my house.

18:12.487 --> 18:14.488
That's right, kate.

18:14.489 --> 18:16.823
Axl isn't gonna be able to
go out with you tonight.

18:16.824 --> 18:19.826
I'm sorry, 'cause clearly you're
a very high level of girl.

18:19.827 --> 18:22.796
But until axl learns the
correct way to talk to his dad,

18:22.797 --> 18:24.331
He's not goi anywhere.

18:24.332 --> 18:26.500
You're welcome to text bella that, too.

18:26.501 --> 18:30.637
god, dad is trying to ruin my entire life!

18:32.573 --> 18:36.543
Aw. Come here. I'll fist-bump you.

18:38.713 --> 18:40.714
He told me I didn't know anything.

18:40.715 --> 18:42.849
What? You know a ton.

18:42.850 --> 18:44.384
Thank you.

18:44.385 --> 18:46.153
Sue hates me.

18:46.154 --> 18:48.588
Oh, that's crazy. You totally rock.

18:48.589 --> 18:50.357
Right?

18:50.358 --> 18:52.893
I don't know. I thought we could help 'em,

18:52.894 --> 18:55.228
And it just seems to enrage them.

18:55.229 --> 18:57.297
It's nature's way.
Teenagers put you through hell

18:57.298 --> 18:59.566
So you don't miss 'em when they go.

18:59.567 --> 19:02.402
Yep, nature's smart.

19:02.403 --> 19:04.571
They're good kids.

19:04.572 --> 19:07.040
If this is the worst of it, we'll be fine.

19:07.041 --> 19:09.242
You're right. We're lucky.

19:09.243 --> 19:12.312
Very lucky.

19:12.313 --> 19:14.815
Of course, we could be luckier.
Don't I know it.

19:17.251 --> 19:20.053
Hi, dad. Morning, mom.

19:20.054 --> 19:22.756
<i>And just like that and for
no particular reason,</i>

19:22.757 --> 19:24.491
<i>Sue was back to her old, sweet self.</i>

19:24.492 --> 19:27.427
<i>I knew it wouldn't last,
so I just went with it.</i>

19:27.428 --> 19:29.329
Oh, and, mom, I wanted you to know

19:29.330 --> 19:31.398
That I decided to wear my new jeans

19:31.399 --> 19:33.767
To the drama club audition anyway.

19:33.768 --> 19:35.802
I'm just gonna wear 'em as bermudas.

19:35.803 --> 19:38.939
<i>Bermudas are in. They're not,
but I wasn't saying a word.</i>

19:38.940 --> 19:41.908
That's great, honey. I think I
stuck 'em in the laundry room.

19:41.909 --> 19:43.376
Okay.

19:43.377 --> 19:46.213
Oh, hey, brick,
the aunts are back from vegas,

19:46.214 --> 19:50.484
And they're coming to pick
up doris. Where is she?

19:50.485 --> 19:54.221
Brick, did something happen to that dog?

19:54.222 --> 19:56.590
And don't forget, I can
always tell when you're lying.

19:56.591 --> 19:59.726
<i>Brick has a tell when he's lying.</i>

19:59.727 --> 20:02.128
Brick, did you break the lamp?

20:02.129 --> 20:05.699
No. I'm lying.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.903
Okay. I'm just gonna tell you the truth.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.505
Doris is gone.

20:11.506 --> 20:16.042
She's gone. Her wagon is empty,
and I don't know where she went.

20:16.043 --> 20:18.178
Congratulations. You were right.

20:18.179 --> 20:21.581
Being responsible is not my strong suit.

20:21.582 --> 20:25.151
I'll be in my room thinking
about what I've done.

20:25.152 --> 20:27.153
aah!

20:31.425 --> 20:34.361
Doris, what were you thinking?

20:34.362 --> 20:37.697
You were almost home free,
and now you're starting over?

20:37.698 --> 20:41.334
Big mistake, doris. Big mistake.

20:41.335 --> 20:43.570
<i>Yep, the next few years
wouldn't be easy--</i>

20:43.571 --> 20:45.639
<i>Hormones, dating, driving.</i>

20:45.640 --> 20:47.574
<i>But whenever I got frustrated,</i>

20:47.575 --> 20:50.644
<i>I just remembered the look in
that dog's eyes and thought,</i>

20:50.645 --> 20:52.946
<i>"at least I got it
better than doris."</i>

20:52.947 --> 20:54.981
Can we keep one?

20:54.982 --> 20:57.217
I promise I'll take care of it this time.

20:57.218 --> 21:01.221
I'm lying.
