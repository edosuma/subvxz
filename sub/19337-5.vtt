WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:04.169
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
Leeza will no longer require

00:04.171 --> 00:07.206
Claude to join a convent.
Leeza wants Claude wed.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.408
Tell Leeza no!
Tell her you promised me!

00:09.410 --> 00:12.277
Claude, a promise will not
bring Leith back to you.

00:12.279 --> 00:15.047
LUC:<i> I will prove myself to be</i>
<i> a loyal husband.</i>

00:15.049 --> 00:16.582
Would you mind
if I kissed you now?

00:16.584 --> 00:18.017
We thought you were dead.

00:18.019 --> 00:19.151
Claude has married
my son Luc.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.686
Claude is wed.

00:20.688 --> 00:24.456
It is my duty to ensure they
have a long and happy marriage.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.125
Take him away.
No!

00:26.127 --> 00:26.692
Claude!

00:26.694 --> 00:28.127
CATHERINE:
Charles.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.362
I heard that you had
taken to your bed.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.499
Do you realize what
people are whispering about you?

00:33.501 --> 00:35.067
Enough!
(screams)

00:35.069 --> 00:36.402
MARY:<i> How goes the courting</i>
<i> of Mrs. Knox?</i>

00:36.404 --> 00:37.536
The closer you get to her,

00:37.538 --> 00:38.470
the closer you get

00:38.472 --> 00:39.805
to her husband's secrets.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.473
My boy's in there!

00:41.475 --> 00:43.175
Help!

00:43.177 --> 00:45.210
MARY:
It's Darnley.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.445
GREER:
<i> You're getting married.</i>

00:46.447 --> 00:48.213
I do wish you were
happier about this.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.515
What's it say, Mary?

00:49.517 --> 00:51.383
It says, "Be careful.
Darnley set his own fire

00:51.385 --> 00:52.484
to appear a hero."

00:53.487 --> 00:56.088
It's signed, "Loyal Watchman."

00:56.090 --> 00:58.223
Who have I agreed to marry?

01:00.194 --> 01:01.760
Are you finding any berries,
love?

01:10.571 --> 01:12.337
Not so far away, Adrian.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.476
(tree branches snapping)

01:17.478 --> 01:18.710
(yelling)

01:18.712 --> 01:20.779
Adrian!

01:20.781 --> 01:22.514
CHARLES:<i> The mother should have</i>
<i> been more careful.</i>

01:22.516 --> 01:24.116
<i> There are bears</i>
<i> in the woods, wolves.</i>

01:24.118 --> 01:25.517
CATHERINE:
<i> I don't think you understand.</i>

01:25.519 --> 01:28.654
The villagers are saying
you took the child.

01:28.656 --> 01:29.822
That's madness.

01:31.325 --> 01:34.126
I've been in my chambers
since last night.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.627
There are witnesses.

01:35.629 --> 01:38.297
Yes, to your strange behavior,
your dark moods,

01:38.299 --> 01:39.565
your mysterious outings.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.567
You roam the woods
at night.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.635
I go for walks to clear my mind.

01:43.637 --> 01:46.171
And to hunt.

01:46.173 --> 01:47.873
Yes, you said so yourself.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.777
(sighs)

01:51.779 --> 01:54.646
I'm not saying you're a
beast that devours children,

01:54.648 --> 01:56.548
but the villagers do
need convincing.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.617
You haven't made a public
appearance in months.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.452
And those who have
seen you are servants

02:00.454 --> 02:03.856
who saw you return to the castle
with blood on your face,

02:03.858 --> 02:05.657
your mouth.

02:05.659 --> 02:10.229
So when a child is snatched from
the very woods that you creep,

02:10.231 --> 02:13.365
whispers begin:
"Could it be the king?"

02:13.367 --> 02:15.234
Commoners always gossip
about royals.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.735
Nothing comes of it.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.370
It's not just the commoners.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.739
Only last night, I
overheard two dukes--

02:20.741 --> 02:22.641
educated, reasonable men--

02:22.643 --> 02:24.910
discussing whether the king's
ailment could be cured.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.779
Or if a better solution were
a silver bullet

02:27.781 --> 02:29.381
or a stake through his heart.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.550
Which dukes? That's treason.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.585
It's not the dukes you need
to worry about.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.754
It's your sister,
the queen of Spain.

02:35.756 --> 02:39.725
If she believes that
you are possessed,

02:39.727 --> 02:42.561
there's no bargaining,
no discussion.

02:42.563 --> 02:45.297
The very inquisitors that have
rained blood down on Spain

02:45.299 --> 02:46.632
will march into French court.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.334
And no one, not even a king,
will be safe.

02:52.606 --> 02:55.274
I'll do whatever you say.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.708
But you can't let Leeza know.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.244
I think I bought us some time.

02:59.246 --> 03:00.913
I convinced Leeza to take a tour

03:00.915 --> 03:02.648
of France's great cathedrals--

03:02.650 --> 03:04.716
a "welcoming home" gift
from the clergy.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.385
But we need to move quickly.

03:06.387 --> 03:09.688
Repairing your reputation
is not an easy task.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.323
I have dispatched
my finest huntsman

03:11.325 --> 03:13.592
to track whatever it was
that took the child.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.227
Once we have the beast,

03:15.229 --> 03:17.496
then we will present our proof
to the villagers.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.598
We need to prove that you're
not a monster

03:19.600 --> 03:21.967
by showing them
what you really are: a king.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.737
A series of regal appearances--

03:25.739 --> 03:28.340
ceremonies, commendations.

03:28.342 --> 03:29.474
Can you do that?

03:32.279 --> 03:33.679
Yes. I'll try.

03:33.681 --> 03:34.880
NARCISSE: I'll make
the arrangements.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.222
Charles, tell me what's wrong.

03:43.224 --> 03:46.625
You're my son
and I want to help you.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.760
There is no helping me.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.264
♪ ♪

03:54.001 --> 03:55.867
MARY:<i> I read about the games</i>
<i> in my mother's letters.</i>

03:55.869 --> 03:57.703
JAMES:
<i> People come from all over,</i>

03:57.705 --> 03:59.471
<i> but more this year than ever,</i>
<i> because of you.</i>

03:59.473 --> 04:00.906
Their rightful
queen's first time

04:00.908 --> 04:02.708
hosting the Highland Games.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.310
Nobles, clan leaders
and commoners alike--

04:05.312 --> 04:07.913
all prouder than ever
to be Scots.
Good.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.616
I plan to announce my
engagement at the banquet.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.651
While the memory of
Lord Darnley's heroic acts

04:12.653 --> 04:14.686
at the harvest festival are
still fresh in everyone's minds.

04:14.688 --> 04:15.854
Admittedly,

04:15.856 --> 04:18.023
saving a child from
a burning building

04:18.025 --> 04:20.859
makes quite the
first impression.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.561
And many commoners
have embraced him,

04:22.563 --> 04:25.030
but the nobles are
not so quickly swayed.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.299
My return has inspired
the people.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.968
But that will fade unless I give
them a cause to rally around.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.403
When I announce my engagement,

04:31.405 --> 04:33.572
I will present my cause:

04:33.574 --> 04:34.806
the English throne.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.842
If you publicly
state your claim,

04:36.844 --> 04:38.944
Elizabeth will take that as
an act of war.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.480
I won't state it openly.

04:41.482 --> 04:45.684
I'll merely allude to Darnley's
royal English ancestry.

04:45.686 --> 04:48.020
And my clan leaders will
understand my intentions.

04:48.022 --> 04:49.405
The promise of

04:49.406 --> 04:50.789
conquering England making it
easier for them

04:50.791 --> 04:53.025
to accept your English groom.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.963
Be sure, Mary.
As an unmarried queen,

04:57.965 --> 05:01.700
your choice of husband is a
defining decision in your reign.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.035
Once it's announced,

05:03.037 --> 05:04.469
it will be difficult
to turn back.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.571
You've only just met the man.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.073
You don't know who he is.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.708
Someone else agrees with you.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.878
This letter claims that Darnley

05:12.880 --> 05:15.080
started the fire
that made him a hero.

05:15.082 --> 05:18.517
If you're thinking that
I sent this, you're wrong.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.453
I want to know the source.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.855
I had the royal messenger
inspect the seal.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.057
He's never seen it before, but

05:25.059 --> 05:27.592
he noted the wax
isn't common beeswax.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.528
It's shellac
from the African continent.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.463
Very rare and hard to find here.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.332
I'll look into it.
Please. Whoever this

05:33.334 --> 05:35.801
"Loyal Watchman" is,
he is an enemy of Darnley's.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.602
Which means he is
an enemy of mine.

05:37.604 --> 05:38.670
Start with Knox.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.771
He has schemed with letters

05:39.773 --> 05:41.506
before,

05:41.508 --> 05:43.642
and the outcome
cost Lola her life.

05:43.644 --> 05:47.079
I'll broach the subject
with Emily Knox.

05:47.081 --> 05:50.682
But... do you think it's true?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.117
What it says about Darnley?

05:52.119 --> 05:53.719
It doesn't matter.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.087
Marrying Lord Darnley

05:55.089 --> 05:58.357
is my best chance at
taking Elizabeth's throne.

05:58.359 --> 06:02.994
So, I will be
marrying Lord Darnley.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.042
(sighing)

06:17.044 --> 06:20.112
I had a lovely time last night.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.915
(Luc sighs)

06:23.917 --> 06:27.552
My mother certainly knows how
to throw a party, doesn't she?

06:29.456 --> 06:31.623
I'm sorry.

06:31.625 --> 06:35.761
I know we're married now,
but the truth is...

06:35.763 --> 06:37.829
We've only just met.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.635
Claude, you don't
need to pretend

06:43.637 --> 06:45.437
that everything is all right.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.672
Things will be uncomfortable
for a while.

06:47.674 --> 06:49.941
And then, one day...

06:49.943 --> 06:51.109
(sighing):
they won't be.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.779
I look forward to that day.
(chuckles)

06:53.781 --> 06:54.646
(door opens)

06:54.648 --> 06:55.898
(gasps):
Narcisse!

06:55.899 --> 06:57.149
LUC: Father! You
should be announced.

06:57.151 --> 06:58.650
I wanted to be the first

06:58.652 --> 07:01.420
to offer my new daughter-in-law
a gift.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.855
It was Luc's mother's favorite.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.123
That's very kind.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.191
Thank you.

07:07.161 --> 07:10.562
I'll just leave it here.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.863
Apologies for
the interruption.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.832
And, Luc, I need
to speak with you

07:13.834 --> 07:15.834
once you're, uh... dressed.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.038
(door closes)

07:20.040 --> 07:23.141
There is a slight hitch
concerning your nuptials.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.977
Leith Bayard is alive.

07:25.979 --> 07:26.978
Leith Bayard...

07:26.980 --> 07:28.213
Ah.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.848
The man Claude was
involved with?

07:29.850 --> 07:31.950
Yeah, he came hobbling back
into court last night.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.952
But don't worry, I managed
to intercept him,

07:33.954 --> 07:35.454
had him thrown in the dungeons.

07:35.456 --> 07:36.521
Why would you do that?

07:36.523 --> 07:38.023
An impulse, really.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.725
Enacted to allow you
to consummate...
No,

07:40.727 --> 07:42.594
you must release him now.
No.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.463
You are going to release him.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.932
And tell Claude that he's alive.

07:46.934 --> 07:50.101
It's important that you appear
to be a good man right now.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.870
I<i> am</i> a good man.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.705
That's the spirit.
Oh, and be sure to tell him

07:53.707 --> 07:55.740
you knew none of this
until right now.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.776
I didn't have any idea!
Which will help

07:57.778 --> 07:59.878
keep your wife from
turning against you.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.681
My wife, who just learned
the man she loves is alive.

08:02.683 --> 08:03.915
Yes.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.016
But you can't let that get
in the way

08:05.018 --> 08:06.618
of everything we've achieved.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.787
A royal marriage.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.122
Let the blame for
detaining Leith fall on me.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.191
It is on you,
you-you power-grasping...

08:13.193 --> 08:14.626
See? We're on the same page.

08:14.628 --> 08:15.961
Now go,

08:15.963 --> 08:16.995
play the hero.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.663
I will release Leith

08:18.665 --> 08:19.965
and I will tell Claude.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.533
Because it is
the right thing to do.

08:22.503 --> 08:23.802
Agreed again.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.173
(festive music playing)

08:28.175 --> 08:30.041
(indistinct conversations)

08:32.012 --> 08:33.678
MAN:
The queen is here!

08:33.680 --> 08:35.046
MARY:
Welcome, my people,

08:35.048 --> 08:36.681
to the Highland Games!

08:36.683 --> 08:39.017
(cheering)
MAN: Hooray, Your Majesty!

08:39.019 --> 08:40.652
It is said
that the first

08:40.654 --> 08:43.755
Highland Games were held
by King Malcolm III

08:43.757 --> 08:46.024
over 500 years ago.

08:46.026 --> 08:49.027
The games continue
in this spirit today.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.563
We do not compete
for personal glory.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.665
Nor for the pride
of our clans.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.901
But for the strength
of Scotland!

08:55.903 --> 08:58.203
(cheering)

08:58.205 --> 08:59.871
MARY: I would like to
add to this tradition

08:59.873 --> 09:01.206
of strength and unity

09:01.208 --> 09:03.675
by formally announcing
my engagement

09:03.677 --> 09:04.676
to Lord Darnley.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.778
(crowd murmuring)

09:06.780 --> 09:08.747
The heir to the
earldom of Lennox,

09:08.749 --> 09:10.849
descendant of
the Royal House of Tudors,

09:10.851 --> 09:13.785
and the future king
consort of Scotland.

09:13.787 --> 09:17.122
Our marriage will
mark a new day,

09:17.124 --> 09:19.991
not just for Scotland, but for
all who live on this isle.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.760
Under my rule,

09:21.762 --> 09:24.329
Scotland will find strength
in unity.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.330
(cheering)

09:25.332 --> 09:26.648
Together,

09:26.649 --> 09:27.965
we will prevail
over the bastards

09:27.968 --> 09:30.001
who stand against us!

09:30.003 --> 09:33.171
And so, I ask for your support

09:33.173 --> 09:35.307
in this union

09:35.309 --> 09:36.875
and for Scotland!

09:36.877 --> 09:39.778
(cheering raucously)

09:39.780 --> 09:40.779
MAN:
Your Grace.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.147
Your Grace.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.181
I am no orator,

09:43.183 --> 09:44.983
only a soldier.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.953
I live to serve you
and my country with blood.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.654
But I've heard of
this Englishman,

09:49.656 --> 09:50.655
born of a man

09:50.657 --> 09:53.024
who was once a Scot.

09:53.026 --> 09:57.262
Yes, Queen Mary speaks
of his "fine" heritage

09:57.264 --> 09:59.664
but fails to mention his father.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.900
Matthew Lennox betrayed

10:01.902 --> 10:03.969
his own country and his kin

10:03.971 --> 10:05.337
rather than fight the English.

10:05.339 --> 10:08.740
(murmuring)
In Lord Darnley's veins

10:08.742 --> 10:10.041
runs that coward's blood.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.677
I am well aware
of this incident,

10:12.679 --> 10:15.280
and a man is not his father.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.882
But a son learns
at his father's knee.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.818
How are we to believe
you won't side

10:19.820 --> 10:23.188
with the bastard Elizabeth
to save your own skin?

10:23.190 --> 10:25.056
Just as your spineless father

10:25.058 --> 10:28.226
sided with Henry VIII
in the war of the Rough Wooing?

10:28.228 --> 10:32.063
My father's honor
was his to lose.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.766
But I cannot allow you
to dishonor my name

10:34.768 --> 10:36.134
or my character.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.036
Earn my respect then,

10:38.038 --> 10:40.705
as I earn the respect of my men:

10:40.707 --> 10:41.773
in combat!

10:41.775 --> 10:43.041
Duels only lead

10:43.043 --> 10:44.743
to dead men, not respect.

10:44.745 --> 10:45.944
Fists then.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.078
A boxing match.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.380
If you win, I bend the knee.

10:48.382 --> 10:50.215
But if I win, you will withdraw

10:50.217 --> 10:52.217
your marriage offer
to Queen Mary.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.852
This is ridiculous...
I accept!

10:53.854 --> 10:55.920
(men cheering and laughing)

11:06.033 --> 11:08.733
How could you agree
to such an idiotic challenge?

11:08.735 --> 11:10.035
I had no choice.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.670
If I hadn't I would've
lost the respect

11:11.672 --> 11:13.038
of every man in that room.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.739
If you lose,
I will still marry you.

11:14.741 --> 11:15.874
But you will have made it

11:15.876 --> 11:16.875
very difficult for us.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.943
I won't lose.

11:18.945 --> 11:22.380
And when I win, Lord Taylor
will pledge his support

11:22.382 --> 11:24.282
and all the others
will follow suit.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.851
Scotland will unite
behind our marriage.

11:28.755 --> 11:31.256
He does have his
father's history to overcome.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.158
You knew that
when you chose him.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.726
Chose me, like a prize pony.

11:34.728 --> 11:37.696
JAMES:
Once the challenge was made,

11:37.698 --> 11:39.164
Darnley had no choice
but to accept.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.100
How he's going to win, however,
is another question.

11:42.102 --> 11:45.136
Lord Taylor is one of
the best boxers in Scotland.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.105
I should know, he's
beaten me three times.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.807
I'm not worried.

11:48.809 --> 11:49.774
I am.

11:49.776 --> 11:50.975
I'm going to win.

11:51.778 --> 11:52.911
I know how to fight.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.312
And more importantly,
I know how

11:54.314 --> 11:57.482
to put on a show
and win people to my side.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.919
James, could you excuse us?

12:00.921 --> 12:03.188
I'd like to talk
to Darnley alone.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.393
(door opens)
I do have a
first name, you know.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.361
It's Henry.
Darnley...

12:10.363 --> 12:12.931
(door closes)
Darnley it is then.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.800
...did you set that fire

12:15.802 --> 12:17.102
so you could play the hero?

12:17.104 --> 12:19.337
Put on a show.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.005
Win people to your side?

12:21.007 --> 12:24.776
Yes. I did.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.377
I did it for our
marriage, for us.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.912
If it weren't for that fire,
you wouldn't have felt

12:27.914 --> 12:29.814
confident enough to
announce our engagement.

12:29.816 --> 12:32.450
It endeared us to your people.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.252
They need to love us,

12:34.254 --> 12:37.422
together, as a couple,
if you want their support.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.791
You lied to me.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.059
Not outright.
Because I didn't ask you

12:41.061 --> 12:42.894
in the moment, "Darling,

12:42.896 --> 12:46.097
are you spreading a devastating
fire for your benefit?"

12:46.099 --> 12:47.832
Look, Mary, if you want
something enough,

12:47.834 --> 12:49.834
you have to be willing
to break the rules.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.302
We have battles to win;
the last thing you should want

12:51.304 --> 12:52.537
is a reluctant partner

12:52.539 --> 12:54.005
at your side.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.945
I'm going to forgive
this deception.

13:00.947 --> 13:04.082
But I will not accept
shortcuts or dishonesty

13:04.084 --> 13:05.817
in the future.

13:05.819 --> 13:08.353
If we must have
this boxing match,

13:08.355 --> 13:10.889
then you will compete my way.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.891
You will fight honorably.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.826
And you will win honorably.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.995
Can you accept that,
Lord Darnley?

13:16.997 --> 13:21.332
As you will consider
no other option...

13:21.334 --> 13:22.834
your way it is.

13:27.073 --> 13:29.841
Thank you for meeting me.

13:29.843 --> 13:32.877
I only came to tell you that you
must stop sending me messages.

13:32.879 --> 13:34.312
I'm sorry.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.446
But I had to see you.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.150
There's a sealed letter...

13:39.152 --> 13:40.385
I can't do this, James.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.353
I can't stop thinking about you.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.955
My thoughts of you,

13:43.957 --> 13:45.857
they are so sinful.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.492
If you care for me at all,

13:47.494 --> 13:50.562
please let me go.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.869
Let me help you with
the child, sir, a lord

13:57.871 --> 13:59.237
shouldn't be saddled
with servants' kinfolk.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.605
Rose is my daughter.

14:00.607 --> 14:05.076
Oh, my sweet little Rose.

14:05.078 --> 14:08.580
No need to cart my daughter
away; I've missed her too much.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.517
Rose was an orphan,
now our own.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.956
I'm so happy to see you both.

14:17.958 --> 14:18.990
We'll walk to the
competition grounds

14:18.992 --> 14:20.325
after you drop off your things.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.961
It's been a long journey, Greer.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.996
Of course.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.364
After you rest, then.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.108
Look, another gift
from your father.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.043
It's beautiful, isn't it?

14:40.013 --> 14:42.647
Leith is alive.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.482
Leith?

14:44.484 --> 14:46.017
When he arrived, my father
had him locked up.

14:46.019 --> 14:49.554
Claude, I swear I did
not know until just now.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.955
I've already ordered
him released.

14:50.957 --> 14:53.057
Released?

14:53.059 --> 14:54.559
Released from where?

14:54.561 --> 14:56.394
The dungeon.
He's here?

14:56.396 --> 14:57.896
In the castle?

14:57.898 --> 14:59.397
Yes.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.569
(panting)

15:04.571 --> 15:06.037
Leith?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.173
It's you.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.314
(crying):
I thought you were dead.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.316
I pictured your face
a thousand times.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.051
Don't ever leave me.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.253
Never.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.989
Claude, you're married.

15:24.991 --> 15:27.091
I tried to stop it,
but Narcisse, he...

15:30.497 --> 15:32.964
Doesn't matter.

15:32.966 --> 15:36.100
I<i> will</i> be with you.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.303
Whatever it takes.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.585
MARY: Wake up, Lord
Darnley, it's nearly noon.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.621
I've asked my brother
James to help train you

15:56.623 --> 15:58.589
for your fight with Lord Taylor.
The man who lost to Taylor

15:58.591 --> 16:00.124
three times is
going to teach me?
He's been in the ring

16:00.126 --> 16:01.726
with Taylor, he can
help with strategy.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.995
Besides, I want to see
if you can fight.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.663
I like to know my odds.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.636
Don't make them too heavy.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.104
I just need to
tire Darnley enough

16:13.106 --> 16:16.174
to better expose his weakness.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.277
You look worried.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.012
Don't be.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.047
Even if Darnley loses the fight
and his bet with Lord Taylor,

16:23.049 --> 16:25.183
I will find a way to make
this marriage happen.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.518
It's not that.
It's Emily Knox.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.687
She's tormented with guilt.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.490
If we continue, she might
confess to Knox himself.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.592
And then he'll realize
that we've been using her

16:34.594 --> 16:37.028
as a means to spy on him.
I worry what he'd do to her.

16:37.030 --> 16:41.399
I can't, in good conscience,
push her any further.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.668
All right.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.304
We'll learn Knox's
secrets some other way.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.373
(door opens)

16:48.375 --> 16:50.708
Tell me what to hit.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.448
You have a good reach.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.484
Which is your dominant hand?

16:59.486 --> 17:01.252
That depends.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.553
Do I finally get
to hit you with it?

17:02.555 --> 17:04.088
♪ There's a chance... ♪

17:04.090 --> 17:05.757

Use it to keep distance

17:05.759 --> 17:07.525
between yourself and Taylor.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.227
He's dangerous up close.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.396
No, I use my left for defense.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.564
I win with my right.

James!

17:32.652 --> 17:34.536
I'm fine.

17:34.537 --> 17:36.421
Well, you're as good
as you say you are.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.588
I told you I could fight.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.390
If you can hit him.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.160
And that won't be easy--
remember, Taylor has never lost.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.694
First time for everything.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.431
♪ Whoa. ♪

17:48.735 --> 17:50.568
We'll send word of when.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.403
Ah, Catherine.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.739
I was just...
How dare you lock Leith Bayard
in the dungeon.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.675
Did you not think
I would find out?
Eventually, yes.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.410
But if you could save
the tongue-lashing,

17:59.412 --> 18:00.611
I have some very good
news from the huntsman.

18:00.613 --> 18:01.846
Then I will be brief.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.648
Claude has chosen Leith.

18:03.649 --> 18:05.449
She married your son
under false pretenses,

18:05.452 --> 18:07.518
and she shall have
an annulment.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.687
There is no point in
us arguing over this;

18:09.689 --> 18:11.756
it is a matter for the Church.
And the king.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.324
He listens to me now.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.593
Charles will put
his weight behind this.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.594
Well, then perhaps I
should withhold my news

18:16.596 --> 18:17.829
from the huntsman.

18:17.831 --> 18:19.497
And perhaps I shall
have your throat

18:19.499 --> 18:20.798
slit in your sleep.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.600
Or let the villagers do it
for me,

18:22.602 --> 18:24.602
when they come for all of
us, to root out the beast

18:24.604 --> 18:25.736
we have protected.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.840
The king's name will be cleared.

18:28.842 --> 18:32.176
The bear that took the child
has been found and killed.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.711
Are you sure?
Yes.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.914
They found some of
the boy's remains

18:35.915 --> 18:38.116
where... a bear might be
expected to keep them.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.284
That's horrible.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.787
But I trust it'll put an end
to the gossip about Charles.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.689
I'll arrange for a
public announcement.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.824
Charles and the
huntsman side by side.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.693
Do that.

18:48.695 --> 18:53.798
It's time the people remember
that my son is their king.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.633
An annulment.

18:55.635 --> 18:56.667
It's the only way.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.302
The Church will never grant it.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.471
We've already consummated
our marriage.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.639
Only we know that.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.774
Say you couldn't perform.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.743
You were
insufficiently aroused.

No one would believe that;
you're-you're too beautiful.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.883
And you've had one annulment.

19:11.885 --> 19:13.651
A second will not look good.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.752
Your reputation will be tainted.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.220
I don't care

19:17.757 --> 19:18.756
Luc,

19:18.758 --> 19:21.926
I'm begging you to do this.

19:21.928 --> 19:25.229
For your future
happiness and mine.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.165
I love another.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.934
I always will.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.773
All right.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.843
I'll say I overindulged
after the wedding.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.746
I was too drunk
to fulfill my husbandly duty.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.581
And you'll have your annulment.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.386
Thank you.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.424
I told you, I don't
need any more training.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.859
I know how to fight.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.328
If you want to win,
you need to be prepared.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.430
You may not know
what you are up against.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.599
Surprised to see me upright,
coward?

20:01.601 --> 20:03.734
Thought you'd get away
with trying to poison me

20:03.736 --> 20:05.269
to ensure victory?

20:05.271 --> 20:06.537
Poison you?
That's nonsense.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.472
A liar, too, I see.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.641
Lord Taylor, please,
what is the meaning of all this?

20:10.643 --> 20:13.277
Your fiancé tried
to rig the fight.

20:13.279 --> 20:15.680
(scoffs)
Go on.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.982
Take a sip, see if you like
what you put in my flask.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.517
Unfortunately for you,

20:19.519 --> 20:20.785
my valet likes
to down my liquor

20:20.787 --> 20:22.386
when I'm not looking.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.921
Now the poor fool's
doubled over with a gut pain

20:23.923 --> 20:27.825
so severe, I wonder
if he'll survive.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.894
Well, while I'm sorry to hear

20:29.896 --> 20:31.862
that you can't trust
your help,

20:31.864 --> 20:33.564
I'm most pleased that you no
longer have an excuse.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.467
An excuse for what?
Your defeat tomorrow.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.836
I didn't poison anyone.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.705
I'd fight you right now,

20:40.707 --> 20:42.473
if you'd like.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.508
No.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.911
I intend to make
an example out of you,

20:46.913 --> 20:48.746
Lord Darnley.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.881
See, bastards and
cheaters are not welcome

20:50.883 --> 20:52.817
on the Scottish throne.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.294
(sighs)

21:04.797 --> 21:06.897
How could you do this?

21:06.899 --> 21:08.633
Is this why you're
so confident that you'll win?

21:08.635 --> 21:09.867
I poisoned no one.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.670
I didn't cheat.
I gave you my word.

21:12.672 --> 21:15.940
Considering your recent actions,
your word isn't worth much.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.908
Mary, you need to believe me.
I wish that I could.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.511
But right now, I am wondering...

21:20.513 --> 21:23.347
What kind of king have I chosen?

21:34.327 --> 21:35.593
Do you really believe
that Darnley attempted

21:35.595 --> 21:36.861
to poison Lord Taylor?

21:36.863 --> 21:37.862
MARY: I believe
that he will fight dirty

21:37.864 --> 21:39.897
to get what he wants.

21:39.899 --> 21:42.833
He certainly doesn't
have Francis' sense of honor.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.969
Francis and I didn't
always agree

21:44.971 --> 21:46.937
on everything, but...

21:46.939 --> 21:48.639
I never doubted

21:48.640 --> 21:50.340
that he was trying to do
the right thing.

21:50.343 --> 21:52.009
Francis was your first love.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.911
And you were like-minded
in many ways.

21:53.913 --> 21:56.013
Darnley... is
a grown man

21:56.015 --> 21:58.015
who has his own way
of seeing the world.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.917
As do you. It's
understandable

21:59.919 --> 22:02.086
that you two don't fit
seamlessly together.

22:02.088 --> 22:05.690
And you won't unless you're
both willing to compromise.

22:05.692 --> 22:06.924
What if we can't?

22:06.926 --> 22:08.559
What if we're too different?

22:08.561 --> 22:10.461
You won't know unless
you give him a chance.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.978
Is he not joining us

22:27.980 --> 22:29.947
No. Not tonight.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.649

22:31.651 --> 22:34.452
You need to talk to him, Greer.

Not enough, I'm afraid.

29:04.443 --> 29:08.412
Since we reunited, you have
been determined to love me.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.347
It's not the same.

29:10.349 --> 29:15.185
With her, I am truly loved
for who I am now.

29:15.187 --> 29:17.054
I'm sorry.

29:24.163 --> 29:26.230
Are you asking for a divorce?

29:26.232 --> 29:27.498
No.
But you could.

29:27.500 --> 29:28.365
You are Protestant.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.267
And you are Catholic.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.204
You could never marry again.

29:34.206 --> 29:37.508
Perhaps I've taken all the
chances at love that I deserve.

29:37.510 --> 29:39.910
I'm sorry that I failed to love
you in the way that you deserve.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.845
Now that you have found it
with another,

29:41.847 --> 29:43.781
I won't deny you your happiness.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.852
I release you
from this marriage.

29:48.854 --> 29:50.087
But what will become of you?

29:50.089 --> 29:51.188
I have my daughter
at my side.

29:51.190 --> 29:54.324
And Mary here
to protect us both.

29:54.326 --> 29:57.928
You've given Rose and me
your name and so much more.

29:59.832 --> 30:01.932
I am forever in your debt.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.274
(knocks on door)

30:17.483 --> 30:19.516
Emily... is
everything all right?

30:19.518 --> 30:21.485
I just... I had to see you.

30:27.593 --> 30:30.260
Coming here is
very dangerous for you.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.062
If your husband found out...

30:32.064 --> 30:34.231
I made sure
that I wasn't followed.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.433
I couldn't wait
a moment longer.

30:36.435 --> 30:38.535
James...

30:38.537 --> 30:42.506
No amount of prayer can erase
the images that flood my mind,

30:42.508 --> 30:44.308
day and night.

30:44.310 --> 30:46.276
They're simply
thoughts, Emily.

30:46.278 --> 30:47.945
Scripture says
that thought

30:47.947 --> 30:50.280
is sin as much as action.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.882
And so...

30:51.884 --> 30:53.116
if I am destined

30:53.118 --> 30:55.586
to burn in hell
for all eternity,

30:55.588 --> 30:58.355
then there's no reason left
to resist your touch.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.202
No one must ever know.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.345
I do not have time for this
right now, Luc.

31:21.347 --> 31:23.213
But an annulment
is out of the question.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.281
Not if we failed

31:24.283 --> 31:25.649
to consummate on
our wedding night.

31:25.651 --> 31:28.485
But you did not fail.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.321
I, myself, saw the two of you
in bed the morning after.

31:31.323 --> 31:33.891
And as lord chancellor
of France,

31:33.893 --> 31:35.659
I cannot perjure myself
in this regard.

31:35.661 --> 31:38.896
The king of France
will support it.

31:38.898 --> 31:42.332
The king is currently
unavailable for such business.

31:42.334 --> 31:43.400
No matter the hurdles,

31:43.402 --> 31:45.469
I intend to respect
Claude's wishes

31:45.471 --> 31:47.404
to be with the man
that she loves.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.539
I assure, you,
eventually the princess

31:49.541 --> 31:52.276
will get over her lowborn beau.

31:52.278 --> 31:55.012
Now, if you will
excuse me,

31:55.014 --> 31:57.180
I have matters of state
to attend to.

31:57.182 --> 31:59.116
You never cared for me
or any of us

31:59.118 --> 32:00.517
after Mother died,
and now you're only using me

32:00.519 --> 32:02.352
for your benefit!
Yes...

32:02.354 --> 32:04.554
I will benefit.

32:04.556 --> 32:08.425
Because a royal marriage
gives one political clout.

32:08.427 --> 32:11.361
I will not be alive
forever, and that power--

32:11.363 --> 32:13.130
the kind afforded
to very few

32:13.132 --> 32:14.665
in this very cold world--

32:14.667 --> 32:16.300
will protect you
and your descendants

32:16.302 --> 32:18.035
once I am gone.

32:18.037 --> 32:21.538
Do not let Claude go.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.149
They found Charles.

32:32.151 --> 32:34.318
He's hiding in a cave
deep in the north wood.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.519
A cave?

32:35.521 --> 32:37.287
Well, why haven't they
brought him back?

32:37.289 --> 32:38.689
Don't worry, he's surrounded.
He's not going anywhere.

32:38.691 --> 32:40.324
The guards are afraid
to force him out.

32:40.326 --> 32:43.126
Some because he's
their king, others...

32:43.128 --> 32:44.294
They don't know
what he is

32:44.296 --> 32:45.462
or what he's capable of.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.131
(sighs)

32:48.133 --> 32:50.600
They think he's a monster
who will attack them.

32:50.602 --> 32:53.003
He will only see you,
alone.

32:53.005 --> 32:55.639
Take me to him at once.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.507
(man coughing)

32:57.509 --> 32:59.643
Have you seen Lord Darnley?

32:59.645 --> 33:02.379
I was told he was
brought here for an injury.

33:02.381 --> 33:04.348
He returned to his chambers
after treatment, Your Grace.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.717
There's not enough room here
with so many fallen ill.

33:06.719 --> 33:08.618
Is it something we should
be concerned about?

33:08.620 --> 33:10.487
Nothing more than
a batch of rotten venison

33:10.489 --> 33:12.456
that made its way to
the servants' dining hall.

33:12.458 --> 33:15.425
Food poisoning.

33:15.427 --> 33:18.161
Lord Taylor's valet...

33:18.163 --> 33:20.430
is he afflicted
with the same thing?

33:20.432 --> 33:22.399
Yes. One of the first
to take ill.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.018
I'm sorry I doubted you.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.187
I was wrong to accuse you.

33:45.357 --> 33:48.158
You didn't spike
Lord Taylor's flask.

33:48.160 --> 33:51.261
You're going to
fight honorably, as promised.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.196
That nearly sounds
like an apology.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.731
I thought that queens
were never wrong.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.400
It's very rare.

33:56.402 --> 34:00.470
Do you know who
did this to you?

34:00.472 --> 34:01.772
One of Taylor's men?

34:01.774 --> 34:04.207
The big one.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.143
I will arrest him after
I've called off the fight.

34:06.145 --> 34:08.512
We'll wait to gather
their support until later.

34:08.514 --> 34:10.113
No, arresting him
won't help us

34:10.115 --> 34:11.181
win over the clan leaders.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.283
I am going to fight.

34:13.285 --> 34:15.585
Are you mad? With your hand
like this, you'll lose.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.687
I'd rather lose with honor
than be thought of as a coward.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.222
Like my father.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.557
Darnley, you can't.

34:20.559 --> 34:21.658
My father was once

34:21.660 --> 34:24.428
confronted with
overwhelming odds.

34:24.430 --> 34:27.597
He aligned with the English
over his own Scotsmen.

34:29.535 --> 34:32.135
That cowardice will
define him

34:32.137 --> 34:33.537
for the rest of his life.

34:33.539 --> 34:35.705
It poisoned him,
poisoned his heart.

34:35.707 --> 34:38.608
Win or lose...

34:38.610 --> 34:40.577
I refuse to be
that kind of man.

34:40.579 --> 34:44.114
And Scotland will not
accept me as king if I am.

34:45.551 --> 34:47.084
You have my support.

34:47.086 --> 34:50.554
Lord Darnley,
it's time.

35:04.837 --> 35:07.704
What do you mean the annulment
isn't going to happen?

35:07.706 --> 35:08.805
It's my father.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.675
He refuses to lie,
now having seen us...

35:11.677 --> 35:13.510
together.

35:15.814 --> 35:19.249
If the lord chancellor is
fighting the annulment,

35:19.251 --> 35:21.118
the odds are heavily
stacked against it.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.385
Now with Charles missing...

35:22.387 --> 35:24.488
And unwell, I've heard.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.256
We don't have
the king's support.

35:29.394 --> 35:33.163
All right, then,
we'll run away together.

35:33.165 --> 35:35.165
We could live
a simple life--

35:35.167 --> 35:37.367
together forever.
Claude, you're a princess.

35:37.369 --> 35:40.303
Living as a commoner
with nothing to your name?

35:40.305 --> 35:41.805
It's harder than you think.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.473
LUC: Running away is
the last thing you should do.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.175
And if you're captured,
you could be charged

35:45.177 --> 35:47.377
with infidelity and shipped
straight to the nunnery

35:47.379 --> 35:48.812
that your sister was
so intent to place you in.

35:48.814 --> 35:51.148
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

35:51.150 --> 35:52.382
And what about Leith?
Are you willing

35:52.384 --> 35:54.451
to risk seeing him
imprisoned, or worse,

35:54.453 --> 35:55.719
for his part
in your abduction?

35:58.457 --> 36:00.924
I hadn't thought of that.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.325
But I've thought
of an alternative

36:02.327 --> 36:04.194
that will keep you both safe

36:04.196 --> 36:05.362
and together.

36:05.364 --> 36:06.863
And how do we know
we can trust you?

36:06.865 --> 36:08.532
Because being
married to a woman

36:08.534 --> 36:10.300
who is in love
with another

36:10.302 --> 36:12.836
isn't exactly
the ideal union

36:12.838 --> 36:15.705
that I dreamed of either.

36:15.707 --> 36:19.442
And so... I propose
an open marriage.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.478
I can be with
whomever I choose,

36:21.480 --> 36:23.446
while the pair of you
can stay together,

36:23.448 --> 36:24.881
in secret, of course,

36:24.883 --> 36:27.250
all the while remaining here
safely at court.

36:27.252 --> 36:28.752
And what do you
get out of it?

36:28.754 --> 36:31.221
There are advantages
for me and my family,

36:31.223 --> 36:34.824
including any heirs that will
share Claude's royal bloodline.

36:36.495 --> 36:38.395
CLAUDE:
How many heirs?

36:38.397 --> 36:40.630
LUC:
Two, three?

36:40.632 --> 36:43.700
Beyond our duty to... breed,

36:43.702 --> 36:47.571
I vow to do everything
I can to ensure

36:47.573 --> 36:50.307
that you live out
your lives together.

36:53.645 --> 36:55.812
Could you?

36:55.814 --> 36:58.815
If I agreed to the terms,

36:58.817 --> 37:00.450
would you consider it?

37:01.820 --> 37:03.286
I don't think so.

37:03.288 --> 37:05.488
But it would protect us.

37:05.490 --> 37:08.558
Sharing you,
the woman that I love?

37:09.828 --> 37:12.629
I'm not sure I can
live with that.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.434
(crowd cheering)

37:17.436 --> 37:19.502
(both grunting)

37:23.642 --> 37:24.708
Hyah!

37:37.356 --> 37:38.855
You're tough for an Englishman,
I'll give you that.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.857
But you'll never win this
one-handed.

37:40.859 --> 37:43.660
Do yourself a favor
and stay down.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.831
(crowd shouting)

37:47.833 --> 37:49.966
(groaning)

37:53.572 --> 37:54.838
(grunting)

37:54.840 --> 37:56.039
Where have you been?

37:56.041 --> 37:57.907
I was with Emily.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.476
But I did learn
that Knox

37:59.478 --> 38:00.777
has never used the type of wax

38:00.779 --> 38:02.412
the Watchman sealed
the letter with.

38:02.414 --> 38:04.381
It's not him.
Well, whoever

38:04.383 --> 38:05.782
this Watchman is,

38:05.784 --> 38:07.917
if their plan was to make me
turn away from Darnley

38:07.919 --> 38:10.553
with that note,
their plan has failed.

38:10.555 --> 38:12.055
(grunting)

38:12.057 --> 38:13.623
He may be rash and
unpredictable at times,

38:13.625 --> 38:15.425
but he has a fierce heart.

38:15.427 --> 38:16.793
JAMES:
Too bad his heart

38:16.795 --> 38:18.528
can't make up
for his right hand.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.797
This fight was over
before it even started.

38:20.799 --> 38:23.633
(blows landing)
(crowd shouting)

38:27.372 --> 38:28.872
(grunting)

38:28.874 --> 38:30.840
(cheering)

38:30.842 --> 38:32.542
Stop the fight!

38:33.979 --> 38:35.512
I must tend to Darnley's wounds

38:35.514 --> 38:37.847
before we proceed
any further.

38:37.849 --> 38:41.518
(shouting, chattering)

38:42.854 --> 38:44.354
(panting)

38:44.356 --> 38:45.555
I think
I'm doing rather well

38:45.557 --> 38:47.891
for only having
my left hand.
I believe

38:47.893 --> 38:49.959
that you can still win
with your right.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.494
What are you doing?

38:51.496 --> 38:53.063
Giving you a chance.

38:55.334 --> 38:56.800
(crowd shouting)

39:01.573 --> 39:03.340
MAN: Go on, you
two, back at it!

39:07.646 --> 39:08.978
(grunting)

39:15.654 --> 39:18.855
(crowd cheering)

39:26.965 --> 39:29.666
I declare Lord Darnley
the winner!

39:29.668 --> 39:31.801
(cheering and applause)

39:34.673 --> 39:38.742
I see I'm not the only one
willing to break the rules.

39:38.744 --> 39:40.777
I wanted to even the odds.

39:40.779 --> 39:44.614
And... to give you
the chance that you deserve.

39:44.616 --> 39:48.852
To give us the chance to see
what we might be, together.

39:48.854 --> 39:52.489
I don't see you
as a prized pony

39:52.491 --> 39:54.524
or as your father's son.

39:54.526 --> 39:57.160
You are your own man, Henry.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.429
I understand that now.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.174
Since we're
putting on a show,

40:11.176 --> 40:14.544
might I suggest...
one more spectacle?

40:14.546 --> 40:16.579
(cheering and applause)

40:29.027 --> 40:32.529
(crickets chirping)

40:32.531 --> 40:34.731
Charles?

40:34.733 --> 40:36.733
Charles, it's me.

40:36.735 --> 40:38.601
CHARLES:
Are they all gone?

40:38.603 --> 40:39.569
Yes!

40:39.571 --> 40:40.804
We're alone. I swear.

40:46.611 --> 40:50.046
You wish to know what ails me,

40:50.048 --> 40:51.748
why I disappear
late at night

40:51.750 --> 40:54.717
and then return with blood
and dirt caked on my face.

40:54.719 --> 41:00.523
In the castle, I hold
other men's lives in my hands.

41:00.525 --> 41:03.726
Out here, alone,

41:03.728 --> 41:08.731
I relive a time when I, myself,
faced such a questionable fate.

41:08.733 --> 41:10.900
On the run,
terrified.

41:10.902 --> 41:12.902
And yet...

41:12.904 --> 41:15.905
I lived.

41:15.907 --> 41:18.641
When you escaped
the Red Knights.

41:18.643 --> 41:21.644
Before they caught up to us
and roasted him to death

41:21.646 --> 41:24.747
in front of my eyes,

41:24.749 --> 41:28.151
Thierry and I stayed alive
by snaring squirrels.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.819
We couldn't risk a fire.

41:29.821 --> 41:32.088
We ate them raw.

41:32.090 --> 41:33.923
If they eluded us,
we'd fill our bellies

41:33.925 --> 41:37.794
with dirt to stave off
the pain of hunger.

41:37.796 --> 41:40.029
Is that what you're doing here,
reliving the horror?

41:40.031 --> 41:43.833
I relive my survival.
It brings me solace.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.869
It's the only thing that does.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.637
Charles, come with me now.

41:47.639 --> 41:49.639
Let me take care of you.

41:49.641 --> 41:51.274
It's too late.

41:51.276 --> 41:52.275
No...
I should never

41:52.277 --> 41:53.209
have become king.

41:53.211 --> 41:55.545
We can fix this.

41:55.547 --> 41:56.112
No!

41:56.114 --> 41:57.647
Don't!

41:57.649 --> 42:00.049
(panting)

42:02.654 --> 42:03.820
(grunts)

42:03.822 --> 42:05.154
Charles!

42:05.156 --> 42:06.789
Charles, please!

42:07.826 --> 42:09.592
Come back!

42:32.584 --> 42:33.917
GIRL:
<i> Oh, no.</i>

42:33.919 --> 42:37.654
