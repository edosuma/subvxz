LITTLE RAT.

11:40.574 --> 11:41.617
- WHAT?

11:41.700 --> 11:43.285
- YEAH, EDDIE DOES HAVE
SOMETHING TO HIDE.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.121
THEY'VE BEEN EMAILING
EACH OTHER.

LOOK.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.499
"EDDIE, I'M SERIOUS.

11:48.582 --> 11:53.129
WE CAN'T BE
TOGETHER ANYMORE."

11:53.212 --> 11:55.381
NINA AND EDDIE
HAD A SUMMER ROMANCE,

11:55.464 --> 11:57.299
AND SHE'S GIVEN HIM THAT LOCKET
TO REMEMBER HER BY.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.134
- SHE WOULDN'T.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.635
- AND NOW NINA FEELS GUILTY,

11:59.718 --> 12:02.805
AND THAT'S THE REAL REASON
SHE HASN'T COME BACK HERE.

12:02.888 --> 12:02.972
HOW COULD THEY?

12:10.229 --> 12:11.272

I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A HUGE FAN,

12:34.587 --> 12:36.505

12:41.802 --> 12:43.095
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:43.179 --> 12:43.846
- MOVING IN.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.931
- I DON'T THINK SO.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.641

12:55.608 --> 12:57.151
WHAT'S ALL THE COMMOTION?

12:57.234 --> 12:58.736
- PLEASE MAY I SHARE
WITH AMBER AGAIN?

12:58.819 --> 12:59.987
- THIS ROOM ABSOLUTELY
NEEDS ME.

13:03.491 --> 13:07.369
- I REFUSE TO GET INVOLVED
IN POLITICS ON MY BIRTHDAY.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.371
- NO, WILLOW, IT DOESN'T.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.458
BACK TO YOUR OWN HOUSE, PLEASE.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.793

13:26.764 --> 13:27.640
- OH, THANKS, KT.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.433
THAT'S SO LOVELY OF YOU.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.352

AND WE'RE CELEBRATING
WITH A FEW SANDWICHES.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.493
- SANDWICHES.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.579
- HEY, I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

EDDIE?

I KNOW ABOUT THE SUMMER ROMANCE.
- THE WHAT?

15:18.584 --> 15:21.128
- WELL, THAT'S THE REAL REASON
NINA HASN'T COME BACK, RIGHT?

15:21.211 --> 15:22.087
- I HAVE NO IDEA--

15:22.171 --> 15:24.673
- DON'T LIE TO ME!

15:24.757 --> 15:26.634
I KNOW EVERYTHING!

15:37.519 --> 15:39.271
GIVE AWAY HER LOCKET.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.231
SOMETHING'S GOING ON,
AND YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.524

IN THIS HOUSE

17:01.895 --> 17:04.772
WHICH ARE STRICTLY
OUT OF BOUNDS.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.693
IF YOU ARE EVER FOUND
IN ANY OF THESE PLACES,

17:07.776 --> 17:10.779
YOUR PUNISHMENT
WILL BE MOST SEVERE.

17:10.863 --> 17:11.739
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

FOCUS ON ME, PLEASE?

17:41.602 --> 17:44.730
- SORRY, AMBER.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.066

17:58.410 --> 18:00.120
JUST IN CASE
MY REAL PRESENTS

18:00.204 --> 18:02.498

18:08.003 --> 18:09.671
THANK YOU.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.297
MM?
MM.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.186
- SO YOU'RE SAYING ALL OF THIS
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE THE OSIRIAN.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.854
- NINA SAID THE CHOSEN ONE
AND THE OSIRIAN

18:25.938 --> 18:28.065
NEEDED TO BE KEPT APART.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.525
- SO THERE WASN'T ANYTHING
BETWEEN YOU?

18:29.608 --> 18:30.526
- NO!

18:30.609 --> 18:31.735
NO.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.278
SHE JUST GAVE ME
THE LOCKET, OKAY?

18:33.362 --> 18:34.363
SHE SAID IT
HAD TO BE HERE,

18:34.446 --> 18:37.741
AND I NEEDED
TO BRING IT BACK.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.869
AND SHE ASKED ME
TO GIVE YOU A LETTER.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.955
- YEAH, BUT IT WAS
A FAKE LETTER.

18:43.038 --> 18:47.376
- THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE...

18:47.459 --> 18:48.710
I MAYBE KIND OF
LOST IT A BIT.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.004
- YOU WHAT?

18:51.088 --> 18:53.549
- I TOLD YOU YOU MIGHT NOT
LIKE WHAT YOU HEAR.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.592
- SO YOU--
YOU FAKED THE LETTER.

18:55.676 --> 18:58.136

19:08.063 --> 19:10.232
I COULD USE A LITTLE HELP.

19:10.315 --> 19:10.399

19:16.697 --> 19:18.574
[twig snaps]

19:18.657 --> 19:19.491
- WHO'S THERE?

19:22.953 --> 19:23.787
ERIC.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.122

19:25.205 --> 19:29.084
SOON AS I SAW THE DATE
MARKED IN YOUR DIARY, I KNEW.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.503
- YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO GO.

19:31.587 --> 19:32.963
I'M MEETING SOMEONE.
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.132
- I KNOW WHO YOU'RE MEETING.

19:35.215 --> 19:35.674
- WHAT?

19:35.757 --> 19:36.633
IMPOSSIBLE.

19:36.717 --> 19:40.387
- UM, THE SEEKER?

19:40.470 --> 19:43.015
- HOW--

19:43.098 --> 19:46.101
YOU COULD NOT
POSSIBLY KNOW THAT.

19:46.184 --> 19:47.728
UNLESS...

19:47.811 --> 19:49.521
- I AM THE SEEKER, VICTOR.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.356
- YOU!

20:03.201 --> 20:04.036
- [gasps]

20:04.119 --> 20:06.413
OH, NOW THAT
IS TO DIE FOR.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.336
I DON'T REMEMBER
ORDERING THIS, THOUGH.

20:12.419 --> 20:15.297
- WELL, YOU'VE OPENED
ALL OF OURS.

20:15.380 --> 20:15.464
- STRANGE.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.300

20:18.926 --> 20:21.136
IT'S FROM ME.

20:21.219 --> 20:22.387
I KNEW YOU'D LIKE IT.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.306
- OH, ALFIE, I LOVE IT.

20:24.389 --> 20:24.431
[squeaks]

20:31.021 --> 20:33.315
- ALL THIS TIME,

20:33.398 --> 20:35.567
AND YOU DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

20:35.651 --> 20:38.278
- LIKE YOU,
I WAS SWORN TO SECRECY.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.030
- YOUR FATHER?
- YES.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.658
SO YOU'RE THE GREAT ENABLER.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.660
- YES.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.913
- BUT WHERE IS THE KEEPER?

20:47.996 --> 20:48.372
- MORE TO THE POINT...

20:51.291 --> 20:51.375
WHO IS HE?

20:58.966 --> 21:00.008
- WHOA, WHOA,
