WEBVTT

00:01.634 --> 00:01.835
.

00:10.943 --> 00:12.045
'...a bit.'

00:12.045 --> 00:15.048
'Hello. I'm Jimmy Carr
and welcome to Drunk History,

00:15.048 --> 00:17.851
the show that brings you
stories from history

00:17.851 --> 00:20.253
as told by blind-drunk comedians.'

00:20.253 --> 00:21.988
Whoo!
'Like Dr Who?,

00:21.988 --> 00:24.791
our show features
spaced-out time travellers,

00:24.791 --> 00:27.894
only ours really do sleep
in old telephone boxes.'

00:27.894 --> 00:30.563
We are free to get it on!

00:30.563 --> 00:32.165
Kiss me, Hardy.

00:32.165 --> 00:34.367
Back off.
I'm gonna be single forever.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.236
Are you all right, love?

00:36.236 --> 00:37.637
Ooh!

00:37.637 --> 00:39.272
Every bone needs a home.

00:40.273 --> 00:42.809
(sniggers) Fucking hell!

00:53.987 --> 00:57.123
'First, a story combining
drunkenness and Trafalgar,

00:57.123 --> 00:58.591
which doesn't, for once,

00:58.591 --> 01:02.328
feature Susan from accounts getting
fingered behind a lion statue.'

01:03.363 --> 01:05.632
'Joe Lycett tells this one after...'

01:10.503 --> 01:13.072
Hello. I'm Joe Lycett,

01:13.072 --> 01:17.610
and I'm here to tell you about
the Battle of Trafalgar.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.846
But let me do some tequila first.

01:21.047 --> 01:22.248
Mm, mm, mm!

01:29.255 --> 01:32.292
The year is 1805.

01:32.292 --> 01:33.726
Whoo!

01:34.727 --> 01:39.933
And there is a man
called Napoleon Bonerman...

01:39.933 --> 01:41.234
parte.

01:41.234 --> 01:45.438
And he... is...
head of the French, basically.

01:45.438 --> 01:48.575
He's having dinner one night.
He's having some cheese,

01:48.575 --> 01:50.677
as the French will do, and he said,

01:50.677 --> 01:53.313
(cod French accent)
"Ah, this is a lovely brie."

01:53.313 --> 01:56.149
"It makes me think
'brie', 'Britain'."

01:56.149 --> 01:58.318
"I will invade Britain!"

02:00.253 --> 02:03.490
Cos he's...
got a quite weird French accident.

02:03.490 --> 02:07.026
Napoleon's like,
"I want to go and take over,

02:07.026 --> 02:08.695
but I don't have the time."

02:08.695 --> 02:11.731
"I'm midway through
series three of Sex and the City."

02:11.731 --> 02:15.602
"What I'll do
is send my mate Villeneuve!"

02:17.203 --> 02:19.672
His name...
Hang on, I wrote it down.

02:19.672 --> 02:22.075
His name is absolutely ridiculous.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.878
This is an actual person's name
in the past.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.880
(reads name out)

02:31.718 --> 02:33.753
Just go with Charles.

02:33.753 --> 02:38.558
So, over in England, King George III
is sat in his castle,

02:38.558 --> 02:40.760
and one of his minders
comes and goes,

02:40.760 --> 02:44.797
"Ooh-ooh!
Er, just heard from the French,

02:44.797 --> 02:47.800
cos I've been over in Paris
hitting all the gay clubs,

02:47.800 --> 02:53.106
that Villeneuve and Napoleon
are gonna come and fuck you up."

02:53.106 --> 02:57.443
And he's like,
"Ooh, thanks for letting me know."

02:57.443 --> 02:59.913
"Not sure I'm happy about that,
actually."

02:59.913 --> 03:03.583
"We should probably think about...
not allowing this."

03:04.584 --> 03:08.321
King George is having none of it,
and he goes to his mate Nelson,

03:08.321 --> 03:11.624
cos he's the head
of the British fleet, and he says,

03:11.624 --> 03:15.995
"Lord Nelson, you're
a great warrior, a great sailor."

03:15.995 --> 03:19.332
"You have been through all sorts."

03:19.332 --> 03:23.636
"You've had dysentery, malaria...
Didn't you go to Corsica?"

03:23.636 --> 03:26.439
"Yeah, that's where I lost the eye,
in Corsica."

03:26.439 --> 03:30.310
"Don't know how you lose an eye
in Corsica, but you managed it."

03:30.310 --> 03:31.878
"Then you went to Tenerife."

03:31.878 --> 03:34.714
"Yes, that a lovely holiday.
Lovely holiday."

03:34.714 --> 03:36.983
"Somehow managed
to lose an arm there.'

03:36.983 --> 03:39.252
He points at the missing arm, goes,

03:39.252 --> 03:42.322
"Just something dodgy in the...
in the buffet there."

03:42.322 --> 03:45.391
He says to Nelson,
"We gotta do something about this."

03:45.391 --> 03:47.627
"We can't have the French
coming over."

03:47.627 --> 03:50.330
"They're a bunch of
absolute fucking pricks."

03:50.330 --> 03:53.666
Nelson's like, "Yeah, fair play.
I'll set something up."

03:53.666 --> 03:56.135
"Can I take my mate Hardy with me?"

03:56.135 --> 03:59.706
And he's like, "Yeah, all right.
Whatever you need."

03:59.706 --> 04:03.476
And so they decide
to battle against the French.

04:03.476 --> 04:04.744
I don't know about you

04:04.744 --> 04:07.814
but I think it's time
for another shot, isn't it?

04:07.814 --> 04:10.984
To the great men of England.

04:13.319 --> 04:14.687
Ooh!

04:15.788 --> 04:17.589
Ooh, no.

04:17.589 --> 04:22.395
It's 21st October 1805,

04:22.395 --> 04:26.265
and the Battle of Trafalgar is on.

04:28.234 --> 04:30.403
Nelson's got his clan,

04:30.403 --> 04:33.206
which is a lot smaller
than Villeneuve's clan.

04:33.206 --> 04:37.877
But what Nelson remembers is there's
just been a revolution in France,

04:37.877 --> 04:41.114
so all of the real badasses...
dead.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.016
Guillotine.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.718
Nelson's like,
"Don't worry about these guys."

04:45.718 --> 04:48.154
"I've looked at their CVs.
No experience."

04:48.154 --> 04:51.157
"This guy,
Cafe Rouge, he's been working at."

04:51.157 --> 04:53.826
"Oh, yeah, we can all make
a chicken baguette."

04:53.826 --> 04:55.928
"Good luck at war, mate!"
(laughter)

04:55.928 --> 04:57.130
He gets another CV.

04:57.130 --> 05:01.567
"Pret A Manger? Oh! Well, I do hope
there isn't a problem

05:01.567 --> 05:04.570
with the avocado wraps."
(laughter)

05:04.570 --> 05:07.807
Nelson, before the fight,
he goes and makes his will,

05:07.807 --> 05:10.209
in the will-writing area
of the boat.

05:10.209 --> 05:12.478
He's with Hardy
and Hardy says to him,

05:12.478 --> 05:14.647
"OK, write the will, whatever."

05:14.647 --> 05:17.984
"But are you sure
about wearing the medals?"

05:17.984 --> 05:21.521
"I think the opposition
are gonna spot those a mile off."

05:21.521 --> 05:25.224
He's like, "Yeah, I get your point,
but I'm really proud of these."

05:25.224 --> 05:27.126
"I worked really hard on them,

05:27.126 --> 05:30.229
like this one for crochet.
I'm really good at crochet."

05:30.229 --> 05:34.400
"I do a lovely nut roast.
So that's the nut roast medal."

05:34.400 --> 05:37.203
"I've also got the medal
for fingering cats."

05:37.203 --> 05:40.673
Hardy's like, "No. We're all proud
of the fingering-cat one,

05:40.673 --> 05:43.943
but if you could wrap it up,
cos we've got to go to war."

05:43.943 --> 05:45.545
So he finishes his will.

05:45.545 --> 05:49.615
Now the great HMS Victory,
Nelson's boat,

05:49.615 --> 05:53.720
they get into this situation
where they're in a full-on 69

05:53.720 --> 05:57.623
with one of the French boats
called the Redoubtable.

05:57.623 --> 06:00.493
And the two ships are firing shots
at one another,

06:00.493 --> 06:03.296
from point-blank range.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.865
Nelson and Hardy
don't seem to give a shit.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.934
They're playing battleships.

06:07.934 --> 06:10.403
I don't know where
they found the time.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.238
Z-4.

06:12.238 --> 06:14.107
(man screams)
No.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.576
D-6.

06:16.576 --> 06:18.411
No.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.546
P-9.

06:22.749 --> 06:23.950
No.

06:23.950 --> 06:28.154
Meanwhile there's a war going on,
and while he's playing battleships,

06:28.154 --> 06:31.824
Nelson gets shot
square between the shoulders.

06:31.824 --> 06:37.029
Pow! And he goes,
"Urgh, something's not right.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.732
And Hardy goes,
"Ooh, love, are you all right?"

06:39.732 --> 06:41.734
He's like, "Well, clearly not."

06:41.734 --> 06:44.203
"I've got a bloody bullethole
in my back."

06:44.203 --> 06:47.573
"Oh, no! We should
take you downstairs, sort you out."

06:47.573 --> 06:50.743
And he's taken down
to the bowels of the ship,

06:50.743 --> 06:52.945
where he meets the doctor.

06:52.945 --> 06:56.349
And the doctor says to him,
"Now, what's happened?"

06:56.349 --> 07:00.319
And Nelson goes, "So,
I was playing a game of battleships,

07:00.319 --> 07:03.156
midway through a full-on war."

07:03.156 --> 07:05.625
"For some reason,
I've got shot in the back,

07:05.625 --> 07:08.795
and I think
I might be going to die."

07:08.795 --> 07:09.996
And the doctor says,

07:09.996 --> 07:13.266
"Ooh, well, somebody's
self-diagnosed, haven't they?"

07:13.266 --> 07:15.835
"Let me have a look.
Yeah, you're fucked."

07:15.835 --> 07:18.371
"Yeah, maybe worth
saying your last words."

07:18.371 --> 07:20.306
"Good luck. I'm off."

07:21.908 --> 07:25.044
Nelson looks up at Hardy
and he says,

07:25.044 --> 07:27.013
"I'm about to die."

07:27.013 --> 07:29.482
"Kiss me, Hardy."

07:29.482 --> 07:32.251
Hardy sort of cups his head
in his hand,

07:32.251 --> 07:36.789
and Hardy leans in slowly,
and goes to kiss him on the lips.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.525
And he's like, "Whoa!"

07:39.525 --> 07:41.994
"The fuck you doing?! You gay?"

07:41.994 --> 07:43.396
"No, I'm not gay."

07:43.396 --> 07:45.932
"It looks pretty gay,
what you're doing."

07:45.932 --> 07:48.000
"No, no, no. I'm not gay.
No, no, no."

07:48.000 --> 07:50.436
"You said, 'Kiss me.'
I just presumed...

07:50.436 --> 07:52.805
on the lips
was what you were after."

07:52.805 --> 07:56.108
"No, obviously not.
Just on the forehead, please."

07:56.108 --> 08:00.012
And Hardy kisses him on the forehead
and he says,

08:00.012 --> 08:02.481
"God bless you, Hardy."

08:02.481 --> 08:06.485
And he dies!
Horribly, in a lot of pain.

08:06.485 --> 08:08.788
Which is visible on his face.

08:08.788 --> 08:11.123
Which will be done very well
by an actor.

08:15.494 --> 08:17.830
(sniggers) Fucking hell!

08:17.830 --> 08:20.466
Oh, fucking hell!
Let me have another go.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.437
(sniggers)

08:25.605 --> 08:27.773
I can't do it. I can't do it.

08:27.773 --> 08:31.244
For 30 more minutes,
the war rages on.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.513
And, actually,
the British win, remarkably.

08:34.513 --> 08:36.716
Villeneuve
is rushing around the deck

08:36.716 --> 08:38.717
of the French ship Redoubtable.

08:38.717 --> 08:43.121
He's desperate to be killed
cos he doesn't want to be captured.

08:43.121 --> 08:46.959
At one point, he finds a gun and
tries to shoot himself, but it jams.

08:46.959 --> 08:50.763
At one point, he holds a sign that
says, "Shoot me, for fuck's sake."

08:50.763 --> 08:51.831
Nobody shoots him.

08:51.831 --> 08:55.668
"This is a bloody nightmare.
I'd like to be shot, please."

08:55.668 --> 08:58.471
And the English jump up
behind him and go,

08:58.471 --> 09:00.973
"All right, mate, you're nicked."

09:00.973 --> 09:02.842
Phwoar, yeah!

09:02.842 --> 09:07.346
Nineteen French ships were sunk
to the bottom of the ocean,

09:07.346 --> 09:10.216
but not one British ship
was sunk.

09:10.216 --> 09:15.154
We did lose 1,500 seamen,
which is a great tragedy.

09:15.154 --> 09:19.225
And I would like to now hold
a moment's silence for those seamen.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.028
That'll do.

09:22.028 --> 09:24.230
So it's a long sail home.

09:24.230 --> 09:28.668
Nelson's body was preserved
in a cask of brandy.

09:28.668 --> 09:31.671
But there is no alcohol
on the boat,

09:31.671 --> 09:34.440
only the alcohol
that Nelson is pickled in.

09:34.440 --> 09:38.311
And they all have a sip
from the brandy.

09:38.311 --> 09:42.081
And it's become known
as sucking the monkey.

09:42.081 --> 09:45.184
Don't ask me why. I don't know.

09:45.184 --> 09:48.888
But, years later, one of the sailors
is sat in a bar

09:48.888 --> 09:50.957
and he gets chatting to another man.

09:50.957 --> 09:52.925
He says, "What you been up to?"

09:52.925 --> 09:55.227
He goes,
"Oh, well, a couple of years ago,

09:55.227 --> 09:57.029
I won the Battle of Trafalgar."

09:57.029 --> 09:59.565
He's like,
"No! I was on that ship as well."

09:59.565 --> 10:01.734
"No, you weren't."
"Yeah, yeah."

10:01.734 --> 10:05.071
And he's like, "Did you...
did you suck the monkey?"

10:05.071 --> 10:08.441
And he's like, "Who told you that?"

10:08.441 --> 10:12.144
And he was like, "Well, we all did."

10:12.144 --> 10:15.114
And he's like, "No. ALL of you did?"

10:15.114 --> 10:18.117
He's like, "We all sucked
the monkey. Did you not?

10:18.117 --> 10:21.587
And he's like,
"Suck the monkey? I married him!"

10:21.587 --> 10:22.922
(monkey squeaks)

10:22.922 --> 10:26.492
And it transpired he'd...
been sucking off a monkey.

10:28.527 --> 10:30.229
An actual monkey.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.768
'Is anyone else worried
that Joe's dead-face

10:35.768 --> 10:37.870
might be the same as
his cum-face?'

10:37.870 --> 10:39.305
'Ad-break time now.'

10:39.305 --> 10:42.308
'We'll be back in five
for questionable accents.'

10:42.308 --> 10:44.744
(lisps) "Eh, I'm single
and let's get it on."

10:44.744 --> 10:47.546
"I like croquetas,
but not interested in the lisp."

10:47.546 --> 10:49.648
"That's not racist." (laughs)

10:51.984 --> 10:52.184
.

10:54.720 --> 10:54.920
.

10:56.522 --> 10:58.624
'Welcome back to Drunk History.'

10:58.624 --> 11:01.427
'We've been asked
not to glamourise alcohol.'

11:01.427 --> 11:02.795
'Quite right, too.'

11:02.795 --> 11:06.732
'No one wants to encourage viewers
to have as much of a banging time.'

11:07.733 --> 11:11.303
'Time now for the story of
a pale-faced, ginger fuck-machine.'

11:11.303 --> 11:14.974
'No, it's not Ed Sheeran.
It's the Virgin Queen.

11:14.974 --> 11:18.110
'Ellie Taylor is gonna tell us
all about it, nailing...'

11:19.645 --> 11:21.847
'...along the way.'
(laughs)

11:21.847 --> 11:24.083
I fucking love cats, me.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.552
(laughs)

11:26.552 --> 11:29.488
This is a story about
the Virgin Queen.

11:29.488 --> 11:33.826
Or as YOU may know her,
Queen Elizabeth...

11:36.629 --> 11:38.964
(man whispers) The first.
...the first.

11:40.332 --> 11:44.970
So, on 17th November 1558,

11:44.970 --> 11:49.175
Queen Elizabeth
took her place on the throne

11:49.175 --> 11:52.311
at the tender age of 25.

11:52.311 --> 11:56.082
She took on a country
that was bankrupt

11:56.082 --> 11:59.085
and that was really falling behind
France and Spain

11:59.085 --> 12:01.387
in regards to superpowers.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.656
Stuff like that.

12:03.656 --> 12:07.093
When she came to power, she had
a load of courtiers around her,

12:07.093 --> 12:09.161
and they all were of the opinion

12:09.161 --> 12:11.797
that unless she married a dude,

12:11.797 --> 12:14.467
Britain was gonna be
even more fucked.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.903
They were all like, "She's gonna cry
and bleed everywhere."

12:17.903 --> 12:19.405
"What's gonna happen?"

12:19.405 --> 12:24.210
We need some testes around
to bloody...

12:24.210 --> 12:27.213
fight the... foreigns.

12:27.213 --> 12:30.516
She can't rule by herself,
because she's got ovaries,

12:30.516 --> 12:34.253
and they are,
"Wah! Wah! Oh, I want to cry!"

12:34.253 --> 12:35.588
That shit.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.424
And Elizabeth, obviously,
did not believe that

12:38.424 --> 12:40.025
cos she was strong-willed.

12:40.025 --> 12:43.362
She was like,
"No, back off. I've got this."

12:43.362 --> 12:46.732
She did not want a man,
but yet still,

12:46.732 --> 12:49.235
loads of guys
starting proposing to her,

12:49.235 --> 12:54.773
even her brother-in-law,
Prince Felipe of Spain.

12:54.773 --> 12:57.476
Prince Philip of Spain
comes up to Elizabeth...

12:57.476 --> 13:01.147
(lispy cod Spanish) "Hey, Elizabeth.
I hear you need a husband."

13:01.147 --> 13:03.282
"I've been married to your sister."

13:03.282 --> 13:07.186
"She dead now, but now, eh,
I'm single and let's get it on."

13:07.186 --> 13:10.756
"I know how to be a prince consort."
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm!

13:10.756 --> 13:14.326
"I know exactly
how to do this shit."

13:15.394 --> 13:17.530
That's what he does. (laughs)

13:19.265 --> 13:20.533
Oh, my God!

13:20.533 --> 13:24.436
So she's like,
"Well, numero... uno..."

13:24.436 --> 13:28.807
"Is that Spanish? Probably.
Numero uno, Felipe,

13:28.807 --> 13:31.744
you were married to my sister,
so... that's weird."

13:31.744 --> 13:33.712
"It's not Hollyoaks, mate."

13:33.712 --> 13:37.483
"Number two, you're Spanish"
And I..."

13:37.483 --> 13:40.586
"I like croquetas,
but I'm not interested in the lisp."

13:40.586 --> 13:41.921
"That's not racist."

13:42.955 --> 13:44.757
(laughs)

13:44.757 --> 13:49.161
And she's like,
"No. No way, Jose. Away with you."

13:49.161 --> 13:52.398
And the reason is, my friends,

13:52.398 --> 13:55.067
because Queen Elizabeth
already had a bae.

13:55.067 --> 13:59.572
And her bae was Robert Dudley.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.074
Now, Queen Elizabeth
and Robert Dudley

14:02.074 --> 14:05.544
had been friends
since they were, like, eight.

14:05.544 --> 14:06.812
They loved each other.

14:08.414 --> 14:11.483
Elizabeth is like,
"I'm massively famous now."

14:11.483 --> 14:13.686
"I'm frickin' monarch of a country."

14:13.686 --> 14:16.855
"I'm gonna get Robert in
as part of my entourage."

14:16.855 --> 14:20.559
So, now Robert
has infiltrated the court.

14:20.559 --> 14:24.263
So, everyone's like,
"Who is this dude?"

14:24.263 --> 14:25.531
"No one knows."

14:25.531 --> 14:30.236
And Queen Elizabeth was seen
creeping into his house.

14:30.236 --> 14:34.206
And Queen Elizabeth's servants
would probably be like,

14:34.206 --> 14:36.308
"Oh! Oh, Your Majesty."

14:36.308 --> 14:39.545
"Oh, Your Majesty,
you've gone... the wrong way.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.281
And she's like, "Oh, I just...
I left my ruff."

14:42.281 --> 14:46.085
"I left my ruff in there, so I'm
just gonna... gonna get my ruff."

14:46.085 --> 14:47.920
(laughs)

14:48.988 --> 14:51.757
But in reality, everyone knew.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.563
Everyone's like,
"That's not a problem."

14:57.563 --> 15:00.032
"Why can't she just marry
Robert Dudley?"

15:00.032 --> 15:03.602
Well, the reason she can't
is cos Robert Dudley...

15:03.602 --> 15:05.237
bloody already married.

15:05.237 --> 15:08.707
To a lady who is called...

15:09.975 --> 15:11.510
Karen.

15:11.510 --> 15:14.079
(man) Karen?!
Janet? (laughs)

15:14.079 --> 15:15.547
Is it Amy?

15:15.547 --> 15:17.116
Amy Robsart.

15:17.116 --> 15:19.885
There we go! Amy Robsart.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.454
And you can imagine
Queen Elizabeth's like,

15:22.454 --> 15:27.960
"Oh, my God! Robert, can you imagine
if we got married one day?

15:27.960 --> 15:31.363
And Robert's like,
"Well, yeah, but I've got a wife,

15:31.363 --> 15:32.865
so not gonna happen."

15:32.865 --> 15:35.034
And Liz is like, "Yeah." (laughs)

15:35.034 --> 15:37.002
(snorts) "Can you imagine if...

15:37.002 --> 15:41.473
(laughs, snorts) "Can you imagine
if your wife died?

15:43.642 --> 15:46.679
And that fucking happened.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.347
Crazy. How does Amy die?

15:48.347 --> 15:51.884
Oh, she's "found"
at the bottom of the stairs.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.153
Now, this is a massive scandal.

15:54.153 --> 15:57.489
And the gossipmongers...

15:57.489 --> 15:59.558
Oh, they are mongering hard!

15:59.558 --> 16:01.560
"Well, was it an accident?"

16:01.560 --> 16:03.629
"Did she just
fall down the stairs?"

16:03.629 --> 16:07.433
"Or what if Elizabeth
may have orchestrated thus?"

16:09.401 --> 16:11.804
Now, there is an inquest,
don't worry.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.673
And the inquest says
everything's above board,

16:14.673 --> 16:16.508
it was "an accident".

16:16.508 --> 16:18.811
But no one really believed that.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.947
Robert hears that his wife...

16:21.947 --> 16:25.184
You can imagine him
going to see Queen Elizabeth, like,

16:25.184 --> 16:28.754
"Liz, hi, babe. I don't know
if you heard the news,

16:28.754 --> 16:31.623
but erm... Amy...

16:31.623 --> 16:33.225
dead."

16:33.225 --> 16:37.563
"So now we're free to get it on.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.832
Elizabeth's like,
"For God's sake!"

16:39.832 --> 16:42.334
"Everyone's gonna think
I'm part of this."

16:42.334 --> 16:45.704
"I've got a brand to protect.
What is your problem?"

16:45.704 --> 16:49.375
Robert's like, "For God's sake!
You've wanted this all along."

16:49.375 --> 16:52.010
"Lizzie, will you marry me?"

16:52.010 --> 16:54.513
"No! Robert, back off!"

16:54.513 --> 16:58.517
"No, I'm not gonna marry you.
I will never marry you."

16:58.517 --> 17:02.988
So she refuses all of his proposals
that come forth.

17:02.988 --> 17:07.291
And there are a lot of them.
There's a barbershop quartet, like,

17:07.291 --> 17:09.828
# Oh, Elizabeth, bum-bum, tee

17:09.828 --> 17:12.364
# Will you marry me?
Bum-bum, bum-bum #

17:12.364 --> 17:16.068
She's like,
"I hate... four-part harmony."

17:16.068 --> 17:20.005
So Dudley kept asking. She was like,
"I need to make a point."

17:20.005 --> 17:24.242
"I need to make a public address
to everyone to know...

17:24.242 --> 17:27.880
that they know
do not ask me to marry them."

17:27.880 --> 17:29.748
"Because I'm not interested."

17:29.748 --> 17:30.916
(clicks fingers)

17:30.916 --> 17:34.686
So what she did,
she made a speech.

17:34.686 --> 17:38.791
She's like, "Listen to me.
Even if I was a milkmaid

17:38.791 --> 17:43.228
with a bucket on my arm, cos that
is what milkmaids do... A-ha!

17:43.228 --> 17:47.132
...no man... is gonna get near...

17:47.132 --> 17:48.801
(sniggers) ...my bucket."

17:50.002 --> 17:53.639
"So.. back the fuck off.
I'm gonna be single forever."

17:53.639 --> 17:57.276
So Robert is like,
"Fine. I take the hint."

17:57.276 --> 17:59.445
"I'm gonna look elsewhere."

17:59.445 --> 18:02.147
He's like,
"I'm gonna have a blow-out."

18:02.147 --> 18:04.983
"Because every bone needs a home."

18:05.984 --> 18:10.088
So Robert is on a night out,
he's blowing off some steam.

18:10.088 --> 18:11.490
Guys need to do.

18:11.490 --> 18:13.091
Where is he? Essex.

18:13.091 --> 18:14.827
(music plays)

18:14.827 --> 18:17.362
He's dancing away.
Who does he see?

18:17.362 --> 18:21.133
Some amazing bird, she's
the frickin' Countess of Essex.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.635
He starts dancing
with the hot bit of stuff.

18:23.635 --> 18:26.305
Robert's like,
"Oh, dude, do you want a drink?"

18:26.305 --> 18:28.474
"Yeah, babe, Malibu and Diet Coke."

18:28.474 --> 18:30.409
"Cool. Do you wanna marry me?"

18:30.409 --> 18:32.711
"Yeah, babe. Cool.
That sounds great."

18:32.711 --> 18:36.815
Robert's like,
"Whoa! Dudes never say yes."

18:36.815 --> 18:39.585
"This is incredible.
I've found myself a wife."

18:39.585 --> 18:44.156
"What's your name, by the way.
She's like, "Oh... it's Lettice!"

18:45.190 --> 18:49.895
"It's Lettice Devereux,
Countess of Essex."

18:50.829 --> 18:54.166
"Lettuce?! Like mixed leaf?"

18:54.166 --> 18:56.635
"Like that?" (laughs)

18:57.636 --> 19:01.373
And he's like, "Oh.
We can deal with that. Never mind."

19:05.878 --> 19:07.513
So they get married.

19:07.513 --> 19:11.283
Now, Elizabeth is fuming.

19:11.283 --> 19:13.719
Even though she's turned him down,

19:13.719 --> 19:15.921
she does not want
anyone to marry him.

19:15.921 --> 19:18.290
Elizabeth, to get her own back,

19:18.290 --> 19:23.629
every time that Elizabeth
wants to go and see Robert,

19:23.629 --> 19:24.930
at his house,

19:24.930 --> 19:28.233
"see" Robert... (clicks tongue)
...she makes Lettice fuck off.

19:28.233 --> 19:31.370
But that is not even enough
for Elizabeth.

19:31.370 --> 19:34.406
Not only does the Queen
shag her husband,

19:34.406 --> 19:39.011
she shags her son, Robert Devereux.
How bad is that?!

19:42.047 --> 19:46.351
I mean, all and all,
she is such a bitch.

19:46.351 --> 19:50.522
But she reigned alone for 44 years,

19:50.522 --> 19:55.794
as one of the most successful,
popular monarchs

19:55.794 --> 19:57.095
Britain has ever had.

19:57.095 --> 20:02.367
And all without the sight
of any testicles near her.

20:04.002 --> 20:07.072
And for that,
I would absolutely raise my glass

20:07.072 --> 20:08.607
to the Virgin Queen.

20:08.607 --> 20:09.975
But she's not a virgin.

20:12.244 --> 20:13.712
(chuckles)

20:15.280 --> 20:18.584
'That's all we have time for.
Next week more comedians

20:18.584 --> 20:21.286
will breathe new life
into historical events,

20:21.286 --> 20:23.956
whilst historical events
will tell comedians

20:23.956 --> 20:25.991
their breath stinks. Goodnight.'

21:27.953 --> 21:28.053
.
