HOWARD: Okay,
I got the camera working now.

01:23.217 --> 01:26.380
I want everyone to smile
as you come through the door.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.716
Here we go.

01:27.821 --> 01:30.586
Lights, camera, action.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.090
-(camera whirring)
- Come on.

01:32.192 --> 01:33.387
Oh, that's good! Good!

01:35.362 --> 01:36.295
Very good.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.422
Good... good...

01:38.532 --> 01:40.261
- Very good! Good!
- Howard?

01:40.367 --> 01:42.734
- Huh?
- Uh, your film is dribbling.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.497
Huh?

01:44.605 --> 01:46.232
- Oh, for goodness sakes.
-(Marion sighs)

01:46.340 --> 01:48.809
Well, so much for "even a child
can operate it," Dad.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.172
Well, I don't understand it.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.938
I never even touched it.

01:52.046 --> 01:54.777
Now will you look at the
instruction manual, Howard?

01:54.882 --> 01:57.078
What good is the manual, Marion?

01:57.184 --> 01:59.084
It's written in Japanese.

01:59.186 --> 02:00.915
Where is it?

02:01.021 --> 02:03.581
Right where you put it--
upstairs in the wastebasket.

02:03.691 --> 02:04.920
Oh...

02:05.025 --> 02:08.655
Let me tell you, these films
are gonna be fabamundo.

02:08.762 --> 02:12.289
As long as, uh, certain
gloomy Gus here shapes up.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.629
What's up, Gus?

02:14.735 --> 02:18.865
It's-it's...
it's just... just college.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.303
How could that be wrong?

02:20.407 --> 02:22.273
You just started.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.276
Well, I'll tell you.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.813
It's not the way they show it
in those brochures.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.474
You know, with the pictures
of a... of a guy and a girl

02:29.583 --> 02:31.108
sitting under a tree,
talking together.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.276
Yeah.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.377
I sat under a tree.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.518
All I picked up was a squirrel.

02:37.624 --> 02:39.854
(laughing)

02:39.960 --> 02:41.223
Now, I'm in college now.

02:41.328 --> 02:44.025
Is it too much to ask to want
to date college girls?

02:44.131 --> 02:45.621
Well, that's your first mistake.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.599
You don't ask me. Ask them.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.533
Well, you think
I didn't try that?

02:49.636 --> 02:52.833
Look, freshman girls-- they only
want to date upperclassmen.

02:52.940 --> 02:56.001
And seniors- they're only
interested in marrying doctors.

02:56.110 --> 02:58.044
The homecoming dance
is tomorrow night.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.306
I don't have a date,

02:59.413 --> 03:02.314
and I absolutely refuse
to take a high school girl!

03:02.416 --> 03:06.216
Now, will you
cool your heels, Red?

03:06.320 --> 03:08.914
The Fonz
will set you up socially.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.854
I've only got one day.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.859
Hey, the places I take you,
you don't strike out.

03:13.961 --> 03:17.955
Well, Fonz, you see, I-l do want
kind of a-a nice girl

03:18.065 --> 03:19.328
to take to the homecoming.

03:19.433 --> 03:22.232
I mean, not a girl
who pops up out of a cake.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.105
All right, all right,
forget class.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.107
I'm gonna take you...
I'm gonna take you

03:29.209 --> 03:35.171
to a place called, uh,
the Finster Memorial Library.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.250
Library? For girls?

03:37.351 --> 03:38.375
That's right.

03:38.485 --> 03:40.010
See, girls got
two things in common.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.681
One is that they all love
to read.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.520
Uh, well,
wh-what's the other thing?

03:47.000 --> 03:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:58.772 --> 04:02.606
Now, didn't I tell you this
place was hopping with chicks?

04:02.709 --> 04:04.541
RICHIE:
Yeah.

04:04.645 --> 04:07.444
You're gonna get a notch
in your "liberry" card.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.447
(Richie laughs)

04:08.549 --> 04:09.641
Shh!

04:25.132 --> 04:26.964
Are you sure Richie's here?

04:27.067 --> 04:29.399
Would Howie lie to me?

04:29.503 --> 04:32.564
Pots, I don't believe
my eyes-- look!

04:32.673 --> 04:34.141
There's Fonzie.

04:34.241 --> 04:36.733
Yeah. What's the Fonz doing
in the library?

04:36.844 --> 04:38.869
They probably put in
a sexy book section.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.037
Yeah.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.275
- Come on, let's see.
- Okay.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.851
- Hey, Fonz.
- Hey, Fonz.

04:44.952 --> 04:48.013
Well, if it ain't
the two stooges.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.452
Boy, Fonz... (laughs)

04:49.556 --> 04:51.854
this is the last place
we thought we'd find you.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.950
- Yeah. -Are you saying
I can't read?

04:54.061 --> 04:55.290
- No, Fonz, no, you read great.
- No.

04:55.395 --> 04:56.658
- Your lips never even move.
- Yeah.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.265
Just-just, Fonz,
you're not the kind of guy

05:00.367 --> 05:01.801
I picture with his nose
in a book.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.870
I have many sides.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.235
Now, what do you want?
I'm busy.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.501
We got to find Rich, Fonz.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.599
- There's big doings tonight.
- You bet.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.179
We're all planning a panty raid
at the Kenwood Hall,

05:12.279 --> 05:13.542
the girls dorm.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.945
Yup. Fonz, Carter's,
Frederick's of Hollywood,

05:16.049 --> 05:17.983
Fruit of the Loom.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.211
What do you say?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.946
What do I say? Panty raid?

05:21.054 --> 05:23.079
Child's tomfoolery.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.988
Child's tomfoolery--
exactly what I said, Fonz,

05:25.092 --> 05:26.685
but they're forcing us to go.

05:26.793 --> 05:27.817
Richie, too--
they're forcing him.

05:27.928 --> 05:28.827
Where is he?

05:28.929 --> 05:31.261
Richie is on a raid all his own.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.924
I suggest you leave him alone.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.161
Oh, right, Fonz,
but could you do us a favor

05:35.269 --> 05:37.931
and tell him to meet us
at Mitchell Hall, 9:30 tonight.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.631
Any later, and he'll miss out.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.299
I'll tell him. Good-bye.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.672
- Thanks, Fonz.
- See you, Fonz.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.542
No, wait!
No, don't do that! Hey!

05:46.647 --> 05:49.173
Fonzie, a girl just threw
War and Peace at me!

05:49.283 --> 05:50.444
Hit me in the head.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.678
Will you keep it down?
We're in a "liberry."

05:52.786 --> 05:54.379
Shh!

05:54.488 --> 05:55.853
All right, okay,
let's just quit.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.323
I've tried three times,
and I've struck out every time.

05:58.425 --> 05:59.483
Let's just forget it.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.992
You're not quitting.

06:01.094 --> 06:05.156
Now, look, when you're strolling
down life's highway,

06:05.265 --> 06:07.734
you don't remember
the strikeout...

06:07.834 --> 06:09.825
Only the home run.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.266
Now, either you're gonna
give it your best shot,

06:13.373 --> 06:15.034
or don't shoot at all.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.945
Okay...

06:20.047 --> 06:22.345
Look out,
'cause I'm gonna do it.

06:26.753 --> 06:28.744
Now, you're sizzling.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.747
(Richie clears his throat)

06:33.894 --> 06:35.293
Oh, excuse me.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.829
Uh, is this seat taken?

06:36.930 --> 06:38.921
Oh, good. Good.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.958
(Richie clears his throat)

06:45.639 --> 06:47.630
(Richie clears his throat)

06:57.784 --> 06:59.775
oh!

07:01.154 --> 07:02.383
Oh...

07:02.489 --> 07:05.424
Slow beginning, but overall,
a very, very good read.

07:10.530 --> 07:13.056
You read the entire book
so fast?

07:13.166 --> 07:14.827
Oh, oh, you noticed that?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.232
(Richie chuckles)

07:16.336 --> 07:18.031
Well, yeah, yeah,
I'm a speed reader.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.367
Self-taught.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.908
Oh. How long you been
reading that way?

07:22.009 --> 07:23.101
Oh, years.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.644
I'm a member
of the Book of the Day Club.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.645
Hmm. Then, uh...

07:26.747 --> 07:28.545
why were you always
getting chewed out

07:28.648 --> 07:31.208
for not doing your reading
in driver's ed class?

07:31.318 --> 07:33.878
How did you know that?

07:33.987 --> 07:35.785
We were in the same class
in high school.

07:35.889 --> 07:36.947
Remember, Richie?

07:37.057 --> 07:39.526
Oh! Oh! Oh, sure!

07:39.626 --> 07:41.094
- I... I remember you.
- Yeah.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.923
Yeah, certainly,
you were the...

07:43.030 --> 07:45.397
- Mm!
- Right. Vaguely. I...

07:45.499 --> 07:47.024
Not at all. I...

07:47.134 --> 07:48.761
I'm Lori Beth Allen.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.166
Uh, you wouldn't remember me.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.204
We had different friends,
I had different hair.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.966
I had this tooth
over here fixed.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.132
- It was...
- Lori Beth.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.937
You always ignored me.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.012
Well, um, I'm grown up now.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.170
I'm in college.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.338
(Richie chuckles)

08:01.448 --> 08:02.745
You-You WM, too?

08:02.849 --> 08:03.748
Oh, yes. Yeah.

08:03.850 --> 08:04.874
Do you live at home?

08:04.985 --> 08:07.044
No, I'm in the dorms.
What about you?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.918
Oh. Oh, I, uh...

08:09.022 --> 08:10.581
I-I live in a house.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.317
Oh. Whose? Phi Delta?

08:12.426 --> 08:14.155
- No.
- Alpha Tau Omega?

08:14.261 --> 08:15.592
No, uh...

08:15.695 --> 08:16.924
Mama Papa Sister.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.962
Who...?

08:26.640 --> 08:29.132
Well, uh, my... my parents.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.641
I figure that, either way,

08:30.744 --> 08:32.610
you eat a lot
of meatloaf, right?

08:32.712 --> 08:34.441
Yeah, well,
I'm about through here.

08:34.548 --> 08:35.708
I finished my book, too.

08:35.816 --> 08:36.977
Oh, uh, Mary Beth?

08:37.083 --> 08:38.279
Lori Beth.

08:38.385 --> 08:40.183
Oh, oh, right, I-l remember...
(anxious laugh)

08:40.287 --> 08:44.280
I-I just wanted to...
to ask you something...

08:44.391 --> 08:46.291
Oh... (nervous chuckle)

08:46.393 --> 08:47.986
I just thought that...

08:48.095 --> 08:50.189
Hey, listen, why...

08:50.297 --> 08:52.959
why don't we go to Arnold's
where we can really talk, okay?

08:53.066 --> 08:55.057
We could go back
to my dorm room.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.367
We could do that?

08:59.873 --> 09:01.432
Oh, c-certainly.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.134
Sure, we-we could do that.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.676
Talk, huh?

09:11.785 --> 09:13.879
Good. My roommate's
in the infirmary.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.182
Oh.

09:16.490 --> 09:18.481
Talking in the dorms.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.961
(rock 'n' roll music playing)

09:26.066 --> 09:28.763
DEEJAY: And the WOW
request line is open.

09:28.869 --> 09:32.737
And this one's dedicated
to Lori Beth from Richie.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.516
I love your new hairdo.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.318
I liked it better the old way.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.859
Me, too. Much better.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.121
Would you like to go

09:55.228 --> 09:56.992
to the homecoming dance
with me tomorrow night?

09:57.097 --> 09:58.496
I'd love to.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.088
Me, too.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.498
Mmm, that was nice.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.005
There's plenty more
where that came from.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.404
You know, we have to watch
the time, Richie.

10:11.511 --> 10:12.876
If it's...

10:12.979 --> 10:15.914
If you're not out by 10:00,
we could be in a lot of trouble.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.484
Oh, we got plenty of time.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.211
- Just trust me.
- I will.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.650
Me, too.

10:22.088 --> 10:23.749
DEEJAY:
It's 10:00, Milwaukee.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.258
Do you know
where your children are?

10:27.994 --> 10:29.928
You know, Richie, I've liked you

10:30.030 --> 10:33.125
ever since I saw you shift gears
in high school.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.533
(imitates engine revving)

10:38.638 --> 10:41.130
But I never dreamt
you were such a tiger.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.039
(roaring)

10:44.177 --> 10:46.202
Mmm...

10:46.313 --> 10:48.111
Lori Beth...

10:48.215 --> 10:50.274
Lori...

10:50.383 --> 10:52.511
L.B.--

10:52.619 --> 10:54.587
I have to ask you something.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.383
Anything, tiger.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.117
What happens if I'm here
after 10:00?

10:59.226 --> 11:01.194
- Why?
- Oh, nothing.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.525
I just noticed that the
announcer said that it's 10:00.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.530
That's nice.

11:05.632 --> 11:08.624
It's 10:00.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.794
Mm! 10:00!

11:10.904 --> 11:12.030
10:00! It's 10:00!

11:12.138 --> 11:13.469
How could you do this to me?

11:13.573 --> 11:14.904
What?
I haven't done anything yet.

11:15.008 --> 11:15.998
It's past 10:00!

11:16.109 --> 11:18.168
Oh, well, look, I think

11:18.278 --> 11:19.541
you're getting worried
over nothing.

11:19.646 --> 11:22.274
So I'm a few minutes late.
What can they do to us?

11:22.382 --> 11:23.406
Expel us!

11:23.516 --> 11:25.848
Expel? No, no,
they wouldn't do that.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.284
- Yes, they would!
- They would?!

11:28.388 --> 11:29.787
Oh, man!

11:29.889 --> 11:32.688
It's happening again.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.760
Why me? Why Richie Cunningham?

11:34.861 --> 11:37.159
I'm a good student,
I work hard.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.663
L-I'm kind to animals.

11:38.765 --> 11:39.994
- Are you through?
- Yes!

11:40.100 --> 11:42.501
- Oh, 10:00! 10:00!
- I'm sorry.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.366
I'll have to call you
tomorrow.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.996
You better leave.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.938
No! You can't leave.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.736
My cologne, right?

11:50.910 --> 11:52.537
No!

11:52.646 --> 11:54.944
No, you can't leave because
of housemother Dunbar.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.016
She locks the door
at 10:00 sharp.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.414
The doors are locked.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.282
You're stuck in here
till 5:00 tomorrow.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.355
Oh, nuts.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.782
No, you don't understand.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.587
We can't take any chances
with Mrs. Dunbar.

12:07.694 --> 12:09.093
She's new
and she's really tough.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.663
She was in World War ll.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.823
As a nurse?

12:12.932 --> 12:15.060
No, a tank.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.660
After she locks up,
she runs a bed check.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.398
The beds are still here.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.065
How long do we have?

12:21.174 --> 12:23.233
Oh, not that long.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.971
If she starts on the first
floor, maybe a half an hour.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.240
Half an hour!

12:27.347 --> 12:30.009
But if she starts up here,
it could be two seconds.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.084
-(knocking on door)
- She's early!

12:33.286 --> 12:34.583
We're gonna be expelled.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.223
Mmm!
What are you doing?

12:37.324 --> 12:39.122
I'm not getting kicked out
for just talking.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.235
(knocking at door)

12:50.337 --> 12:51.702
Mm! Do something!

12:51.805 --> 12:53.170
Under the bed!
Uh, in the closet!

12:53.273 --> 12:54.832
All right, all right.
Stay calm.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.306
Keep a cool head.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.400
I'm jumping out the window!

12:59.612 --> 13:00.773
Can't jump, it's stuck.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.008
- Oh, in-in here.
- Right.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.845
- And try not to wrinkle
anything. -All right.

13:05.719 --> 13:07.346
CHRISTY:
Lori Beth, open up!

13:07.454 --> 13:09.445
It's me, Christy!

13:10.957 --> 13:13.324
- Thank heavens you're alone...
-...Leona's still sick.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.997
So this is where
you want me to hide.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.695
I tell you, very good choice.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.464
The more, the merrier.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.438
Hey, don't I know you?

13:27.540 --> 13:29.804
I don't know, I...
fixed my hair and my tooth...

13:29.909 --> 13:31.434
No, no, no, no, no,
the "liberry."

13:31.544 --> 13:33.774
So where's, uh...

13:33.880 --> 13:35.871
Uh-huh.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.117
Peek-a-boo.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.345
Get out here.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.446
Oh, hi.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.649
You have one, too,
and they know each other?

13:44.758 --> 13:46.692
Fonz, this is,
this is Lori Beth, here.

13:46.793 --> 13:49.091
I'm sorry we didn't
meet before 10:00.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.754
Hey, that's all right.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.094
The Fonz don't
turn into no pumpkin.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.190
Hey, I gotta tell
you something, Rich.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.895
I want to introduce you
to Christy Riggenheimer.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.631
This is a very cool chick.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.639
The things that she did to me

14:01.741 --> 14:03.334
made me feel good all over!

14:03.443 --> 14:04.342
Oh, Fonz, Fonz...

14:04.444 --> 14:05.343
Fonz, I don't think Lori Beth

14:05.445 --> 14:06.571
really wants to hear about that.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.908
Oh, yeah, before
I knew what was happening...

14:08.014 --> 14:09.482
- Fonz! -...before I knew
what was happening,

14:09.582 --> 14:12.779
I was applying for
my own "liberry" card

14:12.886 --> 14:15.480
and checking out
my very first book.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.522
Oh... I thought
you were gonna say, uh...

14:17.624 --> 14:18.955
something else. I...

14:19.058 --> 14:20.389
Oh, I'll tell you
something, Rich.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.827
You should've heard
what she said to me.

14:25.064 --> 14:26.589
She is the first chick--

14:26.699 --> 14:28.963
I'm talking the first chick--

14:29.068 --> 14:30.729
that ever said

14:30.837 --> 14:34.398
that I stimulated her
intellectually.

14:36.409 --> 14:39.606
And now I got
my own "liberry" card.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.771
- Whoa.
- Wait...

14:41.881 --> 14:43.781
y-you went to the library
all those years,

14:43.883 --> 14:45.112
and-and you never got a card?

14:45.218 --> 14:46.208
No, I never thought

14:46.319 --> 14:47.878
they'd give it to a guy like me.

14:47.987 --> 14:49.819
But do you know
there's a card for everybody?

14:49.923 --> 14:51.084
That's right.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.683
Everybody is allowed to read.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.784
Who would've thought
such a thing?

14:57.096 --> 14:58.359
Richie, I hate to alarm you,

14:58.465 --> 14:59.830
but I think
I'm gonna be hysterical.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.162
All right, all right,
don't worry.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.201
If anybody can get us
out of this, it's Fonzie.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.930
Correctamundo.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.268
All right, school's out,
time for action.

15:07.373 --> 15:08.499
The window.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.803
Oh, you're not gonna
be able to open that.

15:09.909 --> 15:10.842
It's painted shut.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.311
Ye of little faith.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.343
Wait...

15:20.453 --> 15:22.251
that's a long way down there.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.254
What do you think?

15:23.356 --> 15:24.721
Well, I think we could make it,

15:24.824 --> 15:27.384
if you want to spend the next
six years in plaster pants.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.258
- Oh, no, no...
- No.

15:29.362 --> 15:30.557
RICHIE:
Hey, hey, Fonz.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.062
- Yeah?
- Fonz, I got an idea.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.758
We could take the mattresses,
right, throw 'em out the window

15:33.867 --> 15:35.130
and use those to break our fall.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.135
Or-or, better yet,
we could take the sheets, see?

15:37.237 --> 15:38.398
We could, we could rip 'em up.

15:38.505 --> 15:39.563
We could tie 'em together,

15:39.672 --> 15:40.798
-make a rope and climb down.
- Yeah. -Yeah!

15:40.907 --> 15:42.204
Boy, I'm really starting
to think now, Fonz.

15:42.308 --> 15:43.332
- Uh, Rich?
- Hmm?

15:43.443 --> 15:46.105
Have you no respect
for state property?

15:46.212 --> 15:48.078
Well, Fonzie,
you have to do something.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.172
Right! Let's party.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.618
Party?!
Fonz, if you get caught,

15:52.719 --> 15:54.016
you're just gonna get yelled at.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.110
The three of us
could be expelled.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.450
- My father'll kill me.
- Expelled.

15:56.556 --> 15:57.955
- You know what that would
be, Fonz? -Hey, hey, hey.

15:58.057 --> 15:58.990
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.992
Freshmen, ugh...

16:01.094 --> 16:02.562
They're not gonna expel you.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.596
They might suspend you
for about a year.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.495
Oh... oh, what a relief.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.033
Fonz, we gotta do something.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.397
All right, think a bit.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.129
All right.

16:11.237 --> 16:13.069
- All right, here's a plan.
- What?

16:13.172 --> 16:15.368
Uh... if we can get
down to the first floor,

16:15.475 --> 16:16.704
we could probably crawl out

16:16.809 --> 16:18.277
a-a supply room window
or something.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.573
- Couldn't we?
- Yeah, great!

16:19.679 --> 16:21.147
Christy and I'll run down
and check it out!

16:21.247 --> 16:22.339
<i>Okay, hum!-</i>

16:22.448 --> 16:24.439
We don't have too much time
till bed check.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.877
You're an absolute genius.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.022
(Wry chuckle)

16:38.398 --> 16:41.527
Takes me a while, but, uh...
I come through. (chuckles)

16:42.569 --> 16:44.298
Einstein, huh?

16:44.404 --> 16:46.736
Well, listen, tell me, Albert,

16:46.839 --> 16:48.807
how do you figure
we're gonna get out that door,

16:48.908 --> 16:50.239
down the stairs
and through the window

16:50.343 --> 16:52.812
without getting nailed?

16:52.912 --> 16:54.437
All right, all right,
just a second.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.037
Albert's really cooking now.

16:58.384 --> 16:59.476
(imitates dog barking)

17:09.628 --> 17:11.256
Hey, Uh. try again.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.263
Oh, Fonz, Fonz, these are nice.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.265
Quality merchandise.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.528
Here, you take first pick.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.296
I want to tell you something--

17:17.403 --> 17:19.598
the judge's decision is final,

17:19.705 --> 17:21.195
'cause the Fonz

17:21.307 --> 17:23.298
don't wear dresses.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.011
Fonz, look, lo-lot-lots
of men wear dresses.

17:30.116 --> 17:32.016
Well, they do.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.711
Uh... Tony Curtis.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.288
And Jack Lemmon.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.117
Uncle Milty!

17:40.927 --> 17:43.589
Davy Crockett
never wore a dress.

17:44.764 --> 17:45.663
What's he got to do with it?

17:45.765 --> 17:46.960
Everything-

17:47.066 --> 17:49.398
When Davy Crockett
was trapped inside the Alamo,

17:49.502 --> 17:51.937
he could've worn
a dress to escape,

17:52.038 --> 17:53.267
but he didn't, oh, no.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.398
Not the King of
the Wild Frontier.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.476
He stuck it out

17:57.577 --> 18:00.308
and so will the Fonz.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.844
But Davy Crockett
died at the Alamo.

18:05.685 --> 18:06.584
Good point.

18:06.686 --> 18:07.881
Give that nightie.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.873
Just level with me, Rich.

18:28.975 --> 18:31.103
- Am I little lopsided?
-(laughs)

18:32.612 --> 18:33.943
No.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.879
(laughing):
I... I can't wait...

18:35.982 --> 18:37.950
I can't wait
to tell Ralph and Potsie

18:38.051 --> 18:39.075
-that the Fonz...
- Hey!

18:40.386 --> 18:41.410
I want to tell you something.

18:41.521 --> 18:42.682
If you tell those two turnips,

18:42.789 --> 18:44.188
if you tell anybody...

18:45.391 --> 18:47.655
How can I be tough
wearing a nightie?

18:49.929 --> 18:50.919
Yeah...

18:51.030 --> 18:52.156
You don't have to worry, Fonz.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.699
Your secret's safe with me.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.393
(insistent knocking on door)

18:55.501 --> 18:57.060
WOMAN:
Mrs. Dunbar! Bed check time!

18:57.170 --> 18:58.069
(whispering):
Bed check, Fonz!

18:58.171 --> 18:59.730
Will you calm down?

19:01.007 --> 19:01.906
All right, look.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.373
If we get past her,

19:03.476 --> 19:05.137
we are home safe, all right?

19:05.244 --> 19:08.077
- Right.
- Cool it.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.445
(high-pitched):
Just one second, Mrs. Dunbar.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.150
We're-we're not decent.

19:14.253 --> 19:15.687
Oh! Oh...

19:17.857 --> 19:19.825
- Very good idea, Fonz.
- Yeah, now what do we do?

19:19.926 --> 19:21.394
Uh, hey. Get under the covers.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.689
Yeah. That's my bed.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.229
All right, it's yours.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.321
I want to tell you something,
this is very exciting.

19:28.034 --> 19:28.933
The lights, the lights!

19:29.035 --> 19:31.504
Get the ligh... what is this?

19:31.604 --> 19:32.662
(pounding on door)

19:32.772 --> 19:34.399
MRS. DUNBAR:
What's going on in there?

19:34.507 --> 19:36.703
(high-pitched): You can come
in now, Mrs. Dunbar.

19:40.246 --> 19:41.441
Took so long I was
beginning to think

19:41.547 --> 19:42.605
you might have a man in here.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.376
(both squeal, shudder)

19:46.052 --> 19:47.850
That ain't funny.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.389
All righty, now, I understand
one of you girls is sick.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.050
FONZIE:
Aaayh... (high-pitched squeal)

19:56.295 --> 19:57.660
What's the big idea, Leona?

19:57.764 --> 19:59.459
Trying to infect the whole dorm?

19:59.565 --> 20:01.363
- Let's have a look-see.
- FONZIE: No, no!

20:01.467 --> 20:03.458
GIRL: Come on, girls,
there's a panty raid!

20:03.569 --> 20:05.298
-(girls screaming)
- Panty raid!

20:05.404 --> 20:06.872
Don't panic, girls.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.605
Sergeant Dunbar,
reporting for duty!

20:17.116 --> 20:19.107
All right, just calm down.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.023
Jllmp?
Jllmp!

20:25.424 --> 20:27.415
Panty raid!

20:32.765 --> 20:34.358
FONZIE:
Yeah.

20:37.203 --> 20:41.003
You just don't
let 'em know it is us.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.439
Hi, girls.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.568
Been waiting for us, huh, girls?

20:46.779 --> 20:48.304
Give us your underwear!

20:48.414 --> 20:49.677
This is a panty raid!

20:49.782 --> 20:51.272
FONZIE (high-pitched):
Oh, don't hurt us, you guys!

20:51.384 --> 20:53.375
(shrieking)

20:55.321 --> 20:56.618
Don't worry.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.294
Don't worry, sweetheart.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.523
We won't hurt you.

21:05.631 --> 21:07.759
Okay, girls, where do you
keep your valuables?

21:07.867 --> 21:08.766
FONZIE:
Oh!

21:13.406 --> 21:16.273
Potsie, look at those girls.

21:17.376 --> 21:18.810
Is this a dorm or a kennel?

21:23.482 --> 21:25.075
You know, Ralph,

21:25.184 --> 21:27.209
the one with
the freckles is cute.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.652
But... but the other one
looks like Fonzie.

21:33.059 --> 21:35.619
Potsie, look!

21:35.728 --> 21:37.719
Boy, she could be
Fonzie's sister.

21:39.031 --> 21:39.964
Look...

21:40.066 --> 21:42.034
don't you mention
this to anybody,

21:42.134 --> 21:43.033
or you'll never eat

21:43.135 --> 21:44.296
solid food again, dig?

21:44.403 --> 21:45.427
- Right.
- Uh-huh.

21:45.538 --> 21:46.437
I'm just glad you guys

21:46.539 --> 21:47.438
showed up, that's all.

21:47.540 --> 21:48.701
Hey, it's Rich, too!

21:48.808 --> 21:50.173
(Ralph laughs)

21:50.276 --> 21:52.836
- Boy, did we pick
the wrong room. -Yeah.

21:52.945 --> 21:55.539
All we're gonna come back with
is two pairs of jockey shorts.

21:56.782 --> 21:57.681
All right, let's go.

21:57.783 --> 21:59.080
- Out the window.
- Aw, come on, Fonz.

21:59.185 --> 22:01.017
- Let us stay, please, come on.
- Wait, aw, come on, Fonz.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.111
This is my first panty raid!

22:03.222 --> 22:05.486
I been waiting for this moment
my whole life, Fonz.

22:05.591 --> 22:06.649
<i>Anything“ do.</i>

22:06.759 --> 22:08.659
A half slip,
a training bra, even.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.786
All right,
you're breaking my heart.

22:10.897 --> 22:11.796
Make it fast.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.889
- Thanks, man.
- Aw, thanks, Fonz!

22:14.901 --> 22:16.926
Aha!

22:17.036 --> 22:20.495
I caught you red-handed,
you panty raiders!

22:20.606 --> 22:22.631
- Duck, Malph!
- Oh, oh, ow!

22:22.742 --> 22:24.267
- Ow!
- You animal!

22:24.377 --> 22:27.347
All right,
out the window, Malph! Go!

22:27.446 --> 22:29.676
- Out! Out! And don't try to...
- Yes, yes, we're going! I'm g...

22:29.782 --> 22:31.580
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- DUNBAR: Okay, Red.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.277
You... charge!

22:33.386 --> 22:34.911
Run!

22:35.021 --> 22:36.989
(grunting, thumping)

22:37.089 --> 22:39.080
- Tomorrow night.
- Yeah!

22:39.191 --> 22:40.124
Out! Out!

22:40.226 --> 22:42.024
LORI BETH:
See you then!

22:42.128 --> 22:43.926
MRS. DUNBAR:
All right.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.088
Out...

22:45.197 --> 22:47.996
you leather-jacketed hoodlum.

22:53.239 --> 22:56.766
Now, is that any way
to talk, gorgeous?

23:03.282 --> 23:07.719
Don't give me any
of your sweet talk, Slick.

23:26.672 --> 23:29.471
I bid you all a fond adieu.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.019
- Mother Dunbar?
- Mother Dunbar?

23:41.120 --> 23:43.612
Come back, Slick.

23:52.498 --> 23:53.465
Hey, Cunningham.

23:53.566 --> 23:54.624
Oh, hi, Fonz.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.793
So... how was, uh, Homecoming?

23:56.902 --> 23:58.336
Oh, great.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.531
Lori Beth thinks
I'm very mature for a freshman.

24:00.639 --> 24:02.869
That's 'cause she never
saw you in a nightie.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.966
Oh, right.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.409
I'm starting to get the hang
of this-this college stuff.

24:07.513 --> 24:08.412
I knew you would.

24:08.514 --> 24:10.710
Well, here's the camera, Rich.

24:10.816 --> 24:11.749
They're ready now.

24:11.851 --> 24:12.875
More movies?

24:12.985 --> 24:15.317
I'm getting out
of here real quick.

24:15.421 --> 24:17.116
Hey, you know what
I think I'm gonna do?

24:18.457 --> 24:21.256
I think I'm gonna
put my "liberry" card to use.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.351
Whoa...

24:24.897 --> 24:26.331
HOWARD: We're all set
whenever you are, Rich.

24:26.432 --> 24:28.332
All right, uh...
lights, Joan, lights.

24:28.434 --> 24:29.833
Okay.

24:29.935 --> 24:31.198
Ready...

24:31.303 --> 24:32.793
and... action!

24:40.613 --> 24:42.047
Okay, good.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.384
Oh, I got it, I got it.
Pick it up.
