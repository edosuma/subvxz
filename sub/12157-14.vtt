WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:02.803
HERE THEY COME!

00:02.836 --> 00:04.572
FASTER! THEY'RE GAINING ON US!

00:04.605 --> 00:05.873
HYAH! GIDDYAP!

00:05.906 --> 00:08.542
CUE THE TUMBLEWEEDS!

00:08.576 --> 00:12.213
(men hooting and hollering)

00:12.246 --> 00:14.082
OH!

00:14.115 --> 00:16.050
AAH!
(thud)

00:16.084 --> 00:20.688
OH, MERCY!
WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE!

00:20.721 --> 00:22.823
(click)
WHOO! YOU'LL BE SAFE,
LITTLE MISSY,

00:22.856 --> 00:25.893
OR MY NAME AIN'T ANNIE OAKLEY!

00:25.926 --> 00:27.928
BUT THERE'S THOUSANDS
OF THEM.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.431
AND THESE WARRIORS
ARE SO TERRIFYING.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.932
CUE THE TERRIFYING WARRIORS!

00:31.965 --> 00:34.535
(men hooting,
horse hooves galloping)

00:34.568 --> 00:36.904
THIS PLACE IS LOUSY
WITH REDSKINS!
(click)

00:36.937 --> 00:39.673
STOP, STOP. BOYD,
YOU CAN'T SAY "REDSKINS."

00:39.707 --> 00:41.342
I HAVE A NOTE. (grunts)

00:41.375 --> 00:42.776
YOU HAVE A NOTE?

00:42.810 --> 00:44.178
YEAH. WHY CAN'T I JUST
BE ON TOP WITH KYLE?

00:44.212 --> 00:45.546
I HAVE THESE
CUTE GRANNY BOOTS ON.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.215
NOBODY CAN SEE THEM.
GET BACK IN THE COACH.

00:47.248 --> 00:50.351
CAN I PLEASE JUST SHOOT HER
AND PUT HER OUT OF HER MISERY?

00:50.384 --> 00:51.852
ARE WE STOPPING?
YES, WE ARE.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.721
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY WALKED
AROUND IN THESE LEATHER PANTS.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.624
MY JUNK IS SCHVITZING.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.026
LISTEN, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS
A WEEK AGO.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.028
YOU GOTTA TAKE OUT ALL THESE
REFERENCES IN THE SCRIPT.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.430
IT'S JUST NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.698
IT'S BASED ON BUFFALO BILL'S
WILD WEST SHOW. WHAT?

01:04.732 --> 01:06.400
I KNOW. COME OVER HERE.
I CAN'T HAVE MY GRANDSON

01:06.434 --> 01:07.801
WALKING AROUND
SAYING "REDSKIN,"

01:07.835 --> 01:09.637
"MERCILESS SAVAGES,"
"INJUN," "WAMPUM,"

01:09.670 --> 01:11.139
ALL THAT STUFF.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.273
BUT IT'S AUTHENTIC.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.108
IT'S WHAT
BUFFALO BILL'S SHOW WAS.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.110
YEAH, BUT PROTESTERS ARE
RARELY INTERESTED IN FACTS.

01:16.144 --> 01:19.813
AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE DON'T GET
PICKETED BY ANGRY HISTORIANS.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.415
BOYD!
HEY, DAD!

01:21.449 --> 01:24.752
DID YOU SEE THE INJUNS
COMING AFTER ME?

01:24.785 --> 01:26.053
"INJUNS," MIKE?

01:26.086 --> 01:28.822
SON, THEY'RE CALLED
"NATIVE AMERICANS."
YES.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.291
THIS IS AN ONGOING
LECTURE SERIES--

01:30.324 --> 01:32.593
"WHY FUN THINGS ARE BAD."

01:32.626 --> 01:34.395
LISTEN,
EVERYBODY JUST TAKE FIVE!

01:34.428 --> 01:36.664
MIKE, I JUST STOPPED BY
YOUR HOUSE TO PICK UP MY SON,

01:36.697 --> 01:38.098
AND HE WASN'T THERE.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.334
(chuckles) OH, HOW LONG DID IT
TAKE YOU TO FIGURE THAT OUT?

01:40.368 --> 01:42.670
MIKE, TODAY IS MY DAY
WITH BOYD,

01:42.703 --> 01:45.273
AND THE LAST THING I WANT
IS HIM CELEBRATING VIOLENCE.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.141
WE'RE NOT CELEBRATING
VIOLENCE, SON.

01:47.175 --> 01:50.110
WE'RE CELEBRATING
BUFFALO BILL CODY'S BIRTHDAY.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.745
RIGHT. WE JUST
ADDED THE VIOLENCE

01:51.779 --> 01:53.681
TO GIVE THE SHOW
A LITTLE KICK.
YEAH.

01:53.714 --> 01:56.750
IT'S MY TRIBUTE TO
A GREAT HUNTER AND OUTDOORSMAN.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.420
AND BY HAVING WARRIORS
ATTACK THE STAGECOACH,

01:59.453 --> 02:01.189
WE'RE JUST SUBLIMINALLY
CONVINCING CUSTOMERS

02:01.222 --> 02:03.691
TO, YOU KNOW,
BUY MORE GUNS AND AMMO.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.859
WELL, I DON'T WANT BOYD
EXPOSED TO ANY OF THIS.

02:05.893 --> 02:06.960
COME ON, BUDDY.
WE'RE LEAVING.

02:06.994 --> 02:08.829
NO, DAD, THIS IS FUN!

02:08.862 --> 02:10.864
BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM!
(toy gun clicking)

02:10.898 --> 02:13.601
THE KID'S A NATURAL.
COME ON.
NICE, MIKE.

02:13.634 --> 02:17.671
THAT IS TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE.
LIGHTEN UP, POCAHONTAS.

02:17.705 --> 02:20.508
HE'S JUST LEARNING A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT HISTORY. THAT'S IT.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.009
ALL RIGHT. WELL, THEN, LET'S
TEACH HIM THE REAL HISTORY.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.311
THE ROAD WEST WAS PAVED

02:23.344 --> 02:25.513
WITH THE BLOOD
OF THE INDIGENOUS POPULATION.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.615
BUT IT GOT PAVED.

02:27.648 --> 02:28.882
AND WHEN DO WE STOP PAYING

02:28.916 --> 02:31.185
FOR STUFF WE DID
HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO?

02:31.219 --> 02:32.686
WELL, BECAUSE AMERICA
JUST KEEPS ON DOING IT--

02:32.720 --> 02:34.488
MARCHING INTO COUNTRIES,
SLAUGHTERING THEIR PEOPLE,

02:34.522 --> 02:35.689
STEALING THEIR RESOURCES.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.458
"HEY, IRAQ,
SORRY YOU DIDN'T HAVE

02:37.491 --> 02:38.459
"WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.528
NOW HAND US ALL YOUR OIL,
PLEASE."

02:40.561 --> 02:41.895
I KNOW. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE PATIENT WITH SADDAM

02:41.929 --> 02:46.033
UNTIL HIS MORE REASONABLE SONS
UDAY AND QUSAY TOOK OVER.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.701
BOYD, I'LL PICK YOU UP
AT HOME LATER.

02:47.735 --> 02:51.071
ALL RIGHT. I-I'M GOING TO PEEL
MYSELF OUT OF THESE PANTS.

02:51.104 --> 02:54.007
IF YOU NEED ME, I'LL BE
AIRING OUT IN THE OFFICE.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.443
JUST KNOCK BEFORE ENTERING.

02:57.445 --> 03:01.449
-- Captions by VITA --

03:03.951 --> 03:06.487
THANKS FOR
THE RIDE HOME, KYLE.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.589
YEAH. LOVE YOUR VAN.

03:08.622 --> 03:12.360
THE GAS FUMES REALLY EXPLAIN
A LOT ABOUT YOU.

03:15.763 --> 03:16.764
(door closes)

03:16.797 --> 03:17.865
(chuckles)

03:19.400 --> 03:20.934
YOU WANNA COME IN?

03:20.968 --> 03:23.036
NO, I'VE GOTTA
HEAD BACK TO THE STORE,

03:23.070 --> 03:25.239
PUT IN A COUPLE MORE HOURS.

03:25.273 --> 03:28.576
THIS COWBOY COSTUME YOUR DAD
SOLD ME WASN'T CHEAP.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.745
WELL, YOU PROBABLY HAVE TIME
FOR A LEMONADE.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.414
(Southern accent)
WHY, YOU MUST BE PARCHED

03:33.447 --> 03:34.782
AFTER THAT GRUELIN' JOURNEY

03:34.815 --> 03:37.150
TRAVELIN' ACROSS THE PRAIRIE.
(laughs)

03:40.321 --> 03:44.392
NO, I KEEP A JUG
OF WATER IN MY VAN...

03:44.425 --> 03:47.328
AND AN EMPTY JUG, JUST IN CASE
I GET STUCK IN TRAFFIC.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.431
ALL RIGHT.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.300
WAIT, KYLE...

03:54.802 --> 03:56.604
IS THERE AN EYELASH
IN MY EYE?

04:01.108 --> 04:04.478
WELL, I CAN'T REALLY SEE
IF YOU KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED.

04:04.512 --> 04:08.816
YOU'RE NOT REALLY GOOD AT TAKING
SUBTLE HINTS, ARE YOU, KYLE?

04:08.849 --> 04:11.852
I MIGHT BE. TRY ME.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.423
I'VE BEEN GIVING YOU ONE.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.759
I GET IT.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.128
I HAVE AN EYELASH IN MY EYE.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.934
WELL, I'D BETTER HIT IT.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.602
IT'S ALWAYS AWKWARD
WHEN I RUN INTO YOUR SISTER,

04:28.636 --> 04:30.471
SINCE WE USED TO DATE
AND ALL.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.140
YEAH, WELL, I'M--I'M PRETTY SURE
KRISTIN'S MOVED ON, KYLE.

04:33.173 --> 04:36.544
(chuckles) NICE TRY, MANDY.
I SAW HER HERE YESTERDAY.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.817
(door opens)

04:43.851 --> 04:45.719
(door closes)

04:49.890 --> 04:50.991
HEY.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.125
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT
OUT THERE?

04:52.159 --> 04:56.063
OH. JUST... KYLE.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.501
(chuckles)
HE'S EMPTYING A JUG.

05:02.536 --> 05:06.006
I HOPE IT'S THE ONE
WITH THE WATER.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.808
WHAT?

05:07.841 --> 05:09.977
UM... I GOTTA GO WORK
ON A TERM PAPER.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.846
THAT'S A THING, RIGHT?
HMM. (chuckles)

05:12.880 --> 05:14.882
UH, HEY, HEY, HEY.
HANG ON.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.183
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

05:16.216 --> 05:19.019
IS THERE SOMETHING GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU AND KYLE?

05:19.052 --> 05:21.355
(snickers)

05:21.389 --> 05:23.290
(snorts) YEAH.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.958
ME AND KYLE?
YEAH.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.628
MOM, YEAH. YOU WISH.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.498
I DON'T. I REALLY DON'T.
NO.

05:30.531 --> 05:33.066
IT'S JUST THAT HE
WALKED YOU TO THE DOOR,

05:33.100 --> 05:34.635
AND WHERE I COME FROM,

05:34.668 --> 05:37.638
THAT MEANS HE'S HOT
FOR WHAT YOU GOT. (chuckles)

05:37.671 --> 05:40.007
EW. PLEASE NEVER
SAY THAT AGAIN.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.845
DO YOU THINK THAT HE'S,
LIKE... HOT FOR WHAT I'VE GOT?

05:44.878 --> 05:46.714
NOPE. STILL GROSS,
EVEN WHEN I SAY IT.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.082
HONEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
BEFORE THIS GOES ANY FURTHER,

05:49.116 --> 05:50.551
YOU--YOU REALLY NEED
TO CONSIDER

05:50.584 --> 05:52.486
HOW THIS IS GONNA AFFECT
OUR FAMILY.
I KNOW.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.655
YEAH.
YEAH. I'M GONNA TALK
TO KRISTIN.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.891
THAT'S NOT THE FAMILY MEMBER
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.727
I HAVE TO TALK TO DAD?

05:59.760 --> 06:01.161
HELL, NO. (scoffs)

06:01.194 --> 06:02.763
OH, THANK GOD. (laughs)

06:02.796 --> 06:04.532
NO, DO NOT TALK
TO YOUR FATHER.
OKAY.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.500
UNLESS, OF COURSE, THIS THING
WITH KYLE GETS SERIOUS,

06:06.534 --> 06:09.036
AND THEN WE'LL... WE'LL PULL HIM
ASIDE AT THE CHURCH

06:09.069 --> 06:10.971
AND TELL HIM WHO
THE GROOM'S GONNA BE.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.609
(knock on door)

06:15.643 --> 06:17.010
OH, HEY.
HEY.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.078
WHERE'S BOYD?

06:18.111 --> 06:20.213
WELL, HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE WITH ME,

06:20.247 --> 06:21.749
BUT INSTEAD,
HE'S WITH YOUR DAD,

06:21.782 --> 06:25.252
RE-ENACTING THE GRIM SLAUGHTER
OF THE NATIVE AMERICANS.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.755
WELL, AS LONG AS
HE'S HAVING FUN.

06:27.788 --> 06:31.058
I NEED YOU TO SIGN SOMETHING.
MY LAWYER DREW IT UP.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.026
YOU HAVE A LAWYER?
YEAH.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.763
WOW.
I'VE GOT A BUDDY
WHOSE SISTER'S A LAWYER.

06:35.796 --> 06:39.467
OF COURSE, HE'S IN JAIL,
SO SHE'S NOT A VERY GOOD ONE.

06:39.500 --> 06:43.070
ANYWAY, IT SAYS YOU NEED TO LET
ME HAVE BOYD TWO DAYS A WEEK,

06:43.103 --> 06:44.705
AND ONE WEEKEND EVERY MONTH.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.140
BUT THAT'S WHAT WE ALREADY DO.
WHY DO WE NEED A CONTRACT?

06:47.174 --> 06:50.377
SO I'M LEGALLY PROTECTED IN THAT
ONE-IN-A-MILLION SCENARIO

06:50.410 --> 06:53.246
WHERE YOUR DAD DOESN'T GIVE
A CRAP WHAT WE AGREED TO.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.415
RYAN, THIS ISN'T
NECESSARY, OKAY?

06:55.449 --> 06:58.285
I'LL TALK TO DAD. HE WON'T TAKE
BOYD ON ONE OF YOUR DAYS AGAIN.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.887
OH, YOU'RE GONNA
TALK TO HIM?
YEAH.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.922
OH, WELL, THEN, WHY DIDN'T
YOU JUST SAY SO? PROBLEM SOLVED.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.725
SIGN HERE, INITIAL THERE,
THERE, AND THERE.
(car doors close in distance)

07:04.758 --> 07:08.128
WHY IS THIS SUDDENLY
SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?

07:08.161 --> 07:09.997
(door opens)
DADDY, I TOOK OUT AN INDIAN!

07:10.030 --> 07:13.467
(imitates gunshots)
(laughs) OH.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.068
THAT'S WHY.
COME ON, BUDDY.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.269
ACTUALLY, HE JUST WINGED HIM.

07:16.303 --> 07:19.339
I SAID IT WAS A KILL SHOT
TO BUILD HIS SELF-ESTEEM.

07:19.372 --> 07:22.009
DAD, IF IT'S RYAN'S DAY,
YOU HAVE TO CHECK WITH HIM

07:22.042 --> 07:24.612
BEFORE YOU TAKE BOYD
ON ONE OF YOUR ADVENTURES.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.013
I'M NOT ASKING
CHIEF FEATHERBRAIN

07:26.046 --> 07:28.682
PERMISSION TO TAKE
MY GRANDSON OUT.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.918
HE'S NOT A FEATHERBRAIN,
DAD.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.186
HE'S NOT A CHIEF, EITHER.

07:33.220 --> 07:36.123
BUT IT PAINTS A PICTURE.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.791
HEY, EVE, GREAT REHEARSAL TODAY.

07:37.825 --> 07:41.128
BUT TOMORROW, INSTEAD OF
PISTOL-PISTOL-RIFLE-RIFLE-KNIFE,

07:41.161 --> 07:44.131
I WANNA GO TO PISTOL-PISTOL-
RIFLE-HATCHET-KNIFE.

07:44.164 --> 07:47.768
DAD, LISTEN, I DON'T WANNA BE
ANNIE OAKLEY ANYMORE.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.170
THAT'S OKAY. WELL STICK WITH
PISTOL-PISTOL-RIFLE-RIFLE-KNIFE.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.772
I'M SORRY. I JUST DON'T WANT
TO PARTICIPATE

07:51.805 --> 07:53.607
IN A BARBARIC CELEBRATION
OF GENOCIDE.
(mutters)

07:53.641 --> 07:55.042
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.444
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
TO CHIEF FEATHERBRAIN, RIGHT?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.346
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT WAS RYAN?

07:59.379 --> 08:02.182
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHO I MEANT BY "FEATHERBRAIN"?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.725
OKAY. GOT SOME NEW PAGES
FOR EVERYBODY.

08:11.759 --> 08:16.029
SEE IF I CAN'T MAKE THIS SCRIPT
A LITTLE LESS OFFENSIVE.

08:16.063 --> 08:19.833
I WAS UP ALL LAST NIGHT
LEARNING MY LINE.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.335
RELAX. WE'VE LEFT IN
"HYAH!" AND "GIDDYAP!"

08:22.369 --> 08:24.972
BUT EVERY REFERENCE TO "INJUN,"

08:25.005 --> 08:27.074
"MERCILESS SAVAGES,"
OR "REDSKIN"

08:27.107 --> 08:31.745
IS NOW GONNA BE REFERRED TO
AS JUST... "PEOPLE."

08:31.779 --> 08:34.548
MIKE, THEY'RE BEING CHASED
BY A HORDE OF ANGRY INDIANS.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.850
YOU CAN'T SAY,
"PEOPLE ARE AFTER US."

08:36.884 --> 08:39.186
IT SOUNDS LIKE
IT'S THE I.R.S.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.057
WHERE--WHERE'S MY NEW
ANNIE OAKLEY?

08:44.091 --> 08:46.526
YOU CAN'T REPLACE EVE.
EVE IS ANNIE OAKLEY.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.562
SHE'S THE BEST ANNIE OAKLEY--
I'M HERE.

08:48.596 --> 08:51.899
MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS
TO THE COSTUME.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.868
ALTHOUGH THIS'LL WORK, TOO.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.236
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT?

08:56.269 --> 08:58.972
WHEN DID THIS TURN INTO
"GIRLS GONE WILD WILD WEST"?

09:01.374 --> 09:05.378
GRANDPA, I GOTTA GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

09:05.412 --> 09:06.780
BOYD, YOU SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF THAT

09:06.814 --> 09:08.281
BEFORE WE LEFT DODGE CITY.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.917
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY...

09:09.950 --> 09:10.918
FROM THE TOP.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.386
HYAH!

09:13.420 --> 09:17.524
THIS PLACE IS LOUSY
WITH... PEOPLE!

09:17.557 --> 09:20.060
HYAH! GIDDYAP!

09:21.428 --> 09:23.130
CUE ANNIE OAKLEY!

09:36.910 --> 09:38.378
(giggles) AHH.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.947
KYLE!

09:41.782 --> 09:43.283
YOU'VE MAKIN' IT TOO BOUNCY!

09:44.818 --> 09:46.553
SORRY.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.722
AND THE NAME'S FESTUS.

09:48.756 --> 09:51.058
HEY, FESTUS! WHAT, DID YOU PUT
THE COACH ON CRUISE CONTROL?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.894
YOU KNOW, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
MOVIN' RIGHT NOW.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.295
ANNIE, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
DEFENDING THE COACH.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.564
OOH, WITH WHAT?
I FORGOT MY GUN.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.232
I SEE THAT.
(cell phone chimes)

09:59.266 --> 10:00.634
DON'T ANSWER A CALL
DURING A SHOOTOUT.

10:00.668 --> 10:01.635
IT'S JUST A TEXT, DAD.
(gasps)

10:01.669 --> 10:03.170
AW, LOOK AT TEGAN'S NEW PUPPY!

10:03.203 --> 10:04.604
(laughs)

10:04.638 --> 10:06.940
GRANDPA?

10:06.974 --> 10:08.642
ALL RIGHT. TAKE FIVE,
EVERYBODY.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.911
THE LITTLE PEASHOOTER'S
GOTTA PEE HERE.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.780
LISTEN, WHEN I GET BACK,

10:12.813 --> 10:14.948
I WANT YOU TO ACT
MORE LIKE EVE. COME ON.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.449
I'LL DO MY BEST, SIR.

10:16.483 --> 10:17.951
TALKIN' TO MANDY.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.320
(exhales)

10:20.353 --> 10:21.922
YEAH. AH.
(exhales)

10:21.955 --> 10:23.290
I LOOK RIDICULOUS.
(laughs)

10:23.323 --> 10:26.994
NO. YOU'RE THE PRETTIEST
ANNIE OAKLEY EVER.
AW.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.361
CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS,

10:28.395 --> 10:30.263
BUT I FEEL LIKE THIS COSTUME'S
JUST A LITTLE TOO TIGHT.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.498
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:31.531 --> 10:32.532
(pop)

10:52.185 --> 10:54.521
(door opens)
EVE, YOU'VE GOTTA BE
ANNIE OAKLEY.

10:54.554 --> 10:57.490
I FELL OFF THE STAGECOACH,
LIKE, THREE TIMES TODAY,

10:57.524 --> 10:59.659
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
I BROKE MY FEMUR.

11:02.162 --> 11:06.700
IF YOUR FEMUR'S UP THERE,
IT'S NOT BROKEN. IT'S LOST.

11:06.734 --> 11:10.503
I DON'T NEED A LECTURE FROM YOU
ON BONE-OLOGY RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

11:10.537 --> 11:13.473
PLEASE, YOU GOTTA BE
ANNIE OAKLEY.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.375
SHE'S BADASS
WHEN YOU DO IT.

11:15.408 --> 11:18.712
NOBODY CAN DO IT AS GOOD AS--
I CAN'T STAND WATCHING YOU
WITH KYLE, OKAY?

11:18.746 --> 11:19.913
WHAT?

11:19.947 --> 11:22.082
YEAH. THAT'S WHY
I QUIT THE SHOW, ALL RIGHT?

11:22.115 --> 11:24.384
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU HAVE TO GO FLIRTING

11:24.417 --> 11:26.153
WITH KRISTIN'S EX-BOYFRIEND.
IT'S GROSS.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.921
WHY DO YOU CARE?

11:27.955 --> 11:29.857
BECAUSE I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON,

11:29.890 --> 11:33.693
AND I--EVERY TIME I SEE KRIS,
I FEEL LIKE I'M LYING TO HER.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.062
OKAY. I'M SORRY.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.696
I'M JUST FINDING IT
REALLY HARD TO TELL KRISTIN.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.065
TELL ME WHAT?

11:41.301 --> 11:43.603
MANDY'S MAKING MOVES ON KYLE.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.272
WHAT?

11:45.305 --> 11:48.575
SEE? IT WASN'T THAT HARD.
NOW YOU TRY IT.

11:53.646 --> 11:56.083
I'M MAKING MOVES ON KYLE.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.218
OH.

11:58.251 --> 12:01.121
BUT YOU'RE COOL
WITH THAT, RIGHT?

12:01.154 --> 12:04.191
UM, NO. NOT SO COOL.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.426
ACTUALLY, I'M FEELING
PRETTY UNCOOL ABOUT THAT.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.628
WHY? YOU TWO BROKE UP,
LIKE, FOREVER AGO.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.130
I HAVEN'T WALKED
THE DOG IN A WHILE.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.131
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S OKAY
TO MAKE OUT WITH HIM

12:11.164 --> 12:13.166
BEHIND THE MINI-MART.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.736
(both) WHAT?

12:16.770 --> 12:18.238
RIGHT. YOU--YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.140
WELL, OUT--OUT OF ALL THE GUYS
IN THE WORLD,

12:20.173 --> 12:22.109
WHY ARE YOU AFTER KYLE?

12:22.142 --> 12:24.211
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T KNOW
ALL THE GUYS IN THE WORLD.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.413
BUT NOT FOR LACK OF TRYING.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.481
AND SECONDLY, WHY DO YOU CARE?

12:28.515 --> 12:30.717
YOU'RE CLEARLY GETTING
BACK TOGETHER WITH RYAN.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.986
UH, WHAT?
WHERE IS THAT COMING FROM?

12:33.020 --> 12:35.322
OH, COME ON.
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS. AM I RIGHT?

12:35.355 --> 12:36.957
YOU AND RYAN REALLY CONNECT.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.159
ME AND KYLE REALLY CONNECT.
IT'S GREAT.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.394
I MEAN, KYLE AND I CAN, LIKE...

12:41.428 --> 12:44.231
CAN FINISH
EACH OTHER'S SENTENCES.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.732
(sighs) WELL,
THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING

12:45.765 --> 12:47.667
NEITHER OF YOU CAN DO
ON YOUR OWN.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.475
HE MAKES ME FEEL...

12:55.508 --> 12:59.146
SPECIAL.
SEE? ANYONE CAN DO IT.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.315
OKAY, I JUST WANNA BE SURE

13:02.349 --> 13:04.251
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HURT HIM, OKAY?

13:04.284 --> 13:05.418
KYLE'S A REALLY SWEET GUY.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.154
HE--HE TAUGHT BOYD
THE ALPHABET...

13:07.187 --> 13:10.257
GIVE OR TAKE
A-A FEW LETTERS.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.492
KRIS, TRUST ME.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.195
I WOULD NEVER HURT KYLE.

13:15.228 --> 13:18.565
OKAY. THEN YOU HAVE
MY BLESSING.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.171
SO YOU AND I ARE COOL?

13:24.204 --> 13:26.206
I GUESS WE ARE NOW.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.975
THE PRECEDENT'S BEEN SET.

13:28.008 --> 13:34.147
ALL YOUR EX-BOYFRIENDS ARE
ON EVE BAXTER'S RADAR.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.683
TOO BAD THEY'RE ALL
STUPID AND GROSS.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.989
(doorbell rings)

13:42.022 --> 13:43.957
OH. HEY.
HI.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.859
UH, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
PICKING UP BOYD FROM TREVOR'S.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.060
YEAH, I GOT
A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

13:47.094 --> 13:50.163
THEY'RE WATCHING "ELLEN"
WITH TREVOR'S TWO MOMS.

13:50.197 --> 13:53.333
DID YOU GET A CHANCE
TO SIGN THOSE PAPERS?

13:53.366 --> 13:55.468
I PRINTED THEM AGAIN IN CASE,
YOU KNOW, YOU LOST THEM

13:55.502 --> 13:56.469
OR BURNED THEM.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.205
EXCUSE ME. WHAT PAPERS?

13:58.238 --> 13:59.907
OR IF HE
GOT A HOLD OF THEM.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.575
BE CAREFUL WHEN
YOU'RE SIGNING PAPERS.

14:02.609 --> 14:06.013
THAT'S HOW I GOT
MY EYES ON A DONOR LIST.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.547
MAY I?

14:07.580 --> 14:09.382
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
FIND OUT ANYWAY.
YEAH?

14:09.416 --> 14:13.353
I WANT TO HAVE IT IN WRITING
THAT I GET TIME WITH BOYD.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.688
WELL, THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.190
OH, LOOK, I TRIPPED.

14:17.224 --> 14:20.160
OH, THEY WENT
INTO THE FIREPL--OH.
DAD, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

14:20.193 --> 14:22.662
OH, WITH ALL THAT WORK
YOU PUT INTO IT.

14:22.695 --> 14:26.233
LOOK AT THAT. THEY--
IT ALL BURNED. LOOK--

14:26.266 --> 14:27.700
I CAN DO THIS
ALL NIGHT, MIKE.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.336
WELL, ONE MORE TIME,

14:29.369 --> 14:32.272
AND THEN I'M GONNA HAVE TO
BORROW YOUR PRINTER.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.107
LOOK, I KNOW
WHEN IT COMES TO BOYD,

14:34.141 --> 14:36.043
THAT I'VE MADE SOME MISTAKES.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.210
HEY,
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

14:37.244 --> 14:40.780
I GOT A COUPLE OF TEAMSTERS
THAT OWE ME A FAVOR.

14:40.813 --> 14:43.750
YOU LEFT HER AND THE BOY
FOR THREE YEARS.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.452
YOU GOT NO RIGHTS
WITH THAT KID.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.021
ARE YOU EVER GONNA
LET ME OFF THE HOOK, MIKE?

14:48.055 --> 14:49.189
I MEAN, WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO

14:49.222 --> 14:50.457
"WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO KEEP APOLOGIZING

14:50.490 --> 14:52.225
FOR OUR MISTAKES FROM THE PAST"?

14:52.259 --> 14:53.360
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S HOLDING A GRUDGE.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.962
YOU'RE STILL MAD AT COWBOYS.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.064
YOUR COWBOYS WIPED OUT A NATION.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.366
OH, STOP.
MY BIG CRIME IS WHAT?
BEING A SCARED TEENAGER?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.368
DAD, WE WERE 17, OKAY?
WE WERE BOTH FREAKING OUT.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.136
AND FOR THE RECORD,
WHEN I GOT PREGNANT,

15:03.170 --> 15:05.638
RYAN SAID HE WOULD SUPPORT ME
IN WHATEVER CHOICE I MADE.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.241
EVEN IF THAT CHOICE
MEANT NOT HAVING BOYD.

15:08.275 --> 15:12.379
DAD, THAT IS--
THAT IS SO NOT FAIR.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.913
WELL,
IT'S TRUE THOUGH, RIGHT?

15:13.947 --> 15:15.315
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET
THE CHOICE YOU WANTED,

15:15.348 --> 15:17.985
YOU RAN OUT ON HER.
WELL, I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE NOW.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.319
EXCEPT FOR RIGHT NOW,

15:19.352 --> 15:22.755
'CAUSE I HAVE TO PICK UP BOYD
FROM THE LESBIANS.

15:22.789 --> 15:32.165
(door opens)

15:33.166 --> 15:34.968
HERE YOU GO, BUDDY.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.270
DAD, I THOUGHT WE WERE
GONNA PLAY INDIANS.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.571
WELL, WE ARE PLAYING INDIANS.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.008
NOW EAT YOUR ACORN MASH.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.843
CAN WE SCALP SOMEBODY?

15:43.876 --> 15:45.245
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.679
UH, VIOLENCE WAS
JUST A TINY PART

15:46.713 --> 15:48.481
OF MOST NATIVE AMERICAN
CULTURES.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.850
YEAH. THE FUN PART.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.185
WELL, ACTUALLY, THERE'S LOTS
OF FUN PARTS, YOU KNOW?

15:52.219 --> 15:54.187
LIKE, UM, HERE,
CHECK OUT THIS MUSIC.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.188
(clicks)

15:55.222 --> 15:58.491
(men chanting)

15:58.525 --> 15:59.492
OH, WAIT, NO.
THAT'S NOT THE GOOD ONE.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.928
(clicks)

16:01.961 --> 16:03.997
(chanting resumes)

16:04.031 --> 16:05.865
NOW WE'RE TALKING.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.467
(knock on door)

16:07.500 --> 16:10.170
(mouth full) OH, I HOPE
THAT'S NOT THE NEIGHBORS.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.007
MOMMY!

16:14.041 --> 16:16.176
DID YOU COME TO PICK ME UP?

16:16.209 --> 16:18.045
NO, HONEY, YOU'RE SPENDING
THE NIGHT WITH YOUR DAD.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.180
OH.
(door closes)

16:21.914 --> 16:24.151
HEY, CAN YOU GO
INTO THE BEDROOM AND PLAY

16:24.184 --> 16:25.652
WHILE I TALK TO DADDY?

16:25.685 --> 16:26.886
YOU CAN TAKE
YOUR ACORN MASH WITH YOU.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.721
YEAH, NO, THANKS.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.159
(door closes)
NICE TEEPEE.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.393
I DON'T MEAN TO NITPICK,

16:33.426 --> 16:35.062
BUT IT LOOKS A LOT
LIKE THE ROCKET SHIP

16:35.095 --> 16:37.030
YOU MADE FOR HIM LAST WEEK.

16:37.064 --> 16:41.834
YEAH. JUST TRYING TO UNDO
SOME OF THE DAMAGE YOUR DAD DID.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.870
YEAH. SO AM I.

16:43.903 --> 16:47.407
LISTEN, HE...
HE WAS WAY OUT OF LINE TODAY.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.278
ACTUALLY, KRIS,
NO, HE WASN'T.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.182
EVERYTHING YOUR DAD SAID
ABOUT ME WAS TRUE.

16:55.215 --> 17:00.053
AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE A WORLD
WITHOUT BOYD IN IT NOW.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.822
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
LET'S LET THE PAST GO, OKAY?

17:02.855 --> 17:06.193
YOU WANT MY DAD TO FORGIVE YOU?
WHY DON'T YOU FORGIVE YOURSELF?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.062
HERE.

17:11.864 --> 17:12.832
YOU SIGNED THEM?

17:12.865 --> 17:14.734
YEP.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.070
THANK YOU.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.072
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

17:19.106 --> 17:25.545
GOOD. BECAUSE I'VE GOT
SOMETHING FOR YOU TO SIGN.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.046
WHAT--WHAT IS THIS?

17:27.080 --> 17:28.281
UH, MY LIST OF DEMANDS.

17:28.315 --> 17:31.284
IT SAYS, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THAT AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK,

17:31.318 --> 17:33.220
YOU HAVE TO ASK ME
HOW MY DAY WAS

17:33.253 --> 17:35.388
AND ACTUALLY LISTEN
TO THE ANSWER.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.224
DON'T I ALREADY DO THIS?

17:37.257 --> 17:39.192
YEAH. I WANT IT IN WRITING.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.127
(exhales)

17:40.160 --> 17:41.128
FAIR ENOUGH.

17:41.161 --> 17:45.298
SO... HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

17:50.803 --> 17:53.140
LET THE RECORD REFLECT
THAT I ASKED.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.547
HOWDY, PARTNERS!

18:00.580 --> 18:01.714
(audience) HOWDY!

18:01.748 --> 18:04.284
(applause,
man speaks indistinctly)

18:04.317 --> 18:05.918
THANK YOU!
THANK YOU FOR COMING BY

18:05.952 --> 18:08.421
TO CELEBRATE BUFFALO BILL CODY'S
BIRTHDAY WITH US. THANK YOU.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.224
NOW ALL THE BOWS AND ARROWS
FROM THE SHOW

18:11.258 --> 18:16.129
WILL BE ON DISPLAY ALONGSIDE
THEIR MODERN-DAY COUNTERPARTS.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.764
ALL RIGHT? NOW BELIEVE ME,

18:17.797 --> 18:19.832
IF THE APACHE HAD CARRIED
THIS BABY HERE,

18:19.866 --> 18:22.469
WE'D BE CELEBRATING
GERONIMO'S BIRTHDAY.

18:22.502 --> 18:26.005
BUFFALO BILL WAS MOST FAMOUS
FOR HIS WILD WEST SHOW...

18:26.038 --> 18:27.340
MANDY, YOU'RE IN
THE WRONG COSTUME.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.342
YOU'RE ANNIE OAKLEY, REMEMBER?

18:29.376 --> 18:31.278
NOT ANYMORE.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.946
THIS COSTUME'S ONLY BIG ENOUGH
FOR ONE ANNIE OAKLEY...

18:33.980 --> 18:35.148
EVEN THEN, BARELY.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.749
ALL RIGHT.

18:36.783 --> 18:41.120
ALL RIGHT. LET'S SHOOT
SOME PEOPLE, PEOPLE!
(clicks)

18:41.154 --> 18:43.122
SHE IS A REAL BEAUTY.

18:43.156 --> 18:47.927
THAT'S A WINCHESTER 30-30.
YEAH, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL RIFLE.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.264
SO ENJOY YOURSELVES.
BUT STICK AROUND AFTERWARDS.

18:51.298 --> 18:54.000
THERE'S A BISON PETTING ZOO
IN THE PARKING LOT...

18:54.033 --> 18:56.769
COMPLIMENTARY BUFFALO WINGS.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.539
I CHOPPED THEM OFF
THE BUFFALOS MYSELF.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.541
THEY'RE HUGE.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.376
(clatter)

19:03.410 --> 19:06.213
(under breath) NEVER WORKS.
WHY DOESN'T THAT WORK?

19:06.246 --> 19:08.348
(horse hooves galloping,
sounds of gunshots)

19:08.381 --> 19:09.182

19:31.170 --> 19:32.639

THE NATIVE AMERICANS.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.508
THEY ARE MAD, BUT THEY HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO BE,

19:35.542 --> 19:37.810
BECAUSE WE'RE STEALING
THEIR LAND!

19:37.844 --> 19:41.348

20:50.350 --> 20:55.121

IN THE ZONE.

20:55.154 --> 20:57.256
MANDY, I'VE GOTTA
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.292
WE'VE BEEN HANGING OUT
A LOT LATELY.

20:59.326 --> 21:02.329

AT PICKING UP ON HINTS.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.497
