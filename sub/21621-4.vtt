00:09.676 --> 00:11.778
I'm sorry,
I think you're in the wrong car.

00:11.845 --> 00:12.980
I'm waiting for a friend.

00:13.814 --> 00:16.683
Really? What's your friend's name?

00:18.318 --> 00:19.620
Maisie Williams.

00:21.388 --> 00:22.389
That's odd.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.492
Because I'm pretty sure...

00:27.661 --> 00:29.096
a girl has no name.

00:29.863 --> 00:30.864
OK, let's go.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.600
Come on, that was funny.

01:25.152 --> 01:27.221
All right, here we go.

01:27.287 --> 01:28.822
Austin, Texas!

01:29.323 --> 01:32.559
I'm so sorry that I'm so late.
I overslept. What are we doing today?

01:32.626 --> 01:34.995
That's OK.
We're at South by Southwest.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.999
And we're going to do
a Game of Thrones themed panel today.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.369
I am the biggest fan! I'm so excited!

01:42.436 --> 01:44.705
I love them and they're so talented!

01:44.771 --> 01:45.973
Sounds good.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.859
What was
your first-ever acting role, Maisie?

03:11.925 --> 03:14.928
First-ever, I guess I should
really count primary school,

03:15.062 --> 03:18.832
and in primary school,
I played Sharon Osbourne.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.901
No way!

03:20.968 --> 03:23.070
Yeah, I played Sharon Osbourne.
I sprayed my hair red.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.772
I wore these leather boots
that were like heeled.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.175
I looked like a hooker.
I was awful.

03:28.242 --> 03:31.912
-But I was like...
-Sharon doesn't look like a hooker.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.647
No, I looked like a hooker.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.416
OK. What was the play that you played
Sharon Osbourne in?

03:36.483 --> 03:39.786
-It was the Nativity play.
-With Sharon Osbourne in it?

03:39.853 --> 03:43.190
Exactly, and I was there like,
"Well, darlings..."

03:43.257 --> 03:45.192
And that was like kind of all I remember.

03:45.259 --> 03:48.362
How does she talk, though?
Does she talk like that?

03:48.428 --> 03:50.464
Yeah. She's just like super camp.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.800
Doesn't she...
Yeah, she's super camp.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.102
Love it, darling, darling.

03:55.102 --> 03:58.005
Love it.
Shout a bit in that voice.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.807
-Ozzy! No, no.
-No.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.044
Let's take it down a notch.

04:04.111 --> 04:07.181
Yeah, I feel like we need
something that's...

04:07.247 --> 04:09.249
Like a real pinnacle
of someone's career,

04:09.316 --> 04:13.253
a song that was real defining
in their, in their character.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.255
I feel like I need to cry.

05:00.267 --> 05:01.301
F***!

05:31.899 --> 05:32.933
F***.

06:30.157 --> 06:34.528
Do you remember when we used
to read normal sentences

06:34.595 --> 06:37.931
but like Sean Bean, like Ned Stark?

06:38.065 --> 06:39.399
Aye, I do.

06:39.466 --> 06:41.735
-Aye.
-Well, listen.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.171
-I've a pettish little game.
-Have you?

06:44.238 --> 06:46.306
Go on. What have you prepared for us?

06:46.373 --> 06:49.076
-I'm gonna give you a sentence, right?
-Yeah.

06:49.510 --> 06:53.547
And then you gotta say it like,
like you was in Game of Thrones.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.750
Like you're on top of the wall,

06:56.817 --> 07:00.153
and you're like staring out
to all the Wildlings.

07:00.220 --> 07:03.023
All the wild things, all right.
I've got it.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.324
-Ready.
-All right.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.759
You should do this bottom one.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.028
All right.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.263
And...

07:10.531 --> 07:11.632
Action!

07:13.367 --> 07:14.735
Hakuna matata.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.405
What a wonderful phrase.

07:20.574 --> 07:23.076
Hakuna matata.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.079
Ain't no passing craze.

07:28.549 --> 07:31.351
I can imagine the score like kicks in
and then it pans off...

07:31.418 --> 07:33.353
And then it goes like this.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.124
Hakuna.

07:37.191 --> 07:38.525
-Matata.
-Matata.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.494
Ain't no passing craze.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.796
Ain't no passing craze.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.631
OK, your turn.

07:45.065 --> 07:50.704
Imagine Arya finally gets back
to Winterfell, right?

07:50.771 --> 07:54.608
And she like knocks on the gates,
OK, and you open the door...

07:54.675 --> 07:56.810
-Yeah.
-And I go...

07:57.578 --> 07:59.746
It's me. I'll marry you.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.016
And then just like...

08:04.852 --> 08:06.753
I just hopped out.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.223
OK, next one to you.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.025
-All right.
-I'm ready.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.662
My God. Becky.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.899
Look at her butt.

08:19.566 --> 08:20.667
-Butt.
-Butt.

08:21.435 --> 08:23.203
Look at her butt.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.439
It's so big,

08:26.173 --> 08:29.209
she looks like
one of those rap guys' girlfriends.

08:29.276 --> 08:32.645
-Aye, you're sure right.
-Aye, you're not wrong there.

08:32.712 --> 08:36.283
-You're not wrong there, gal.
-Aye, you're not wrong there.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.684
-My God.
-God.

08:38.751 --> 08:41.054
-Becky, look at her butt.
-Becky, look at her butt.

08:41.087 --> 08:45.926
-It's sure big.
-OMG, Becky, look at her butt.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.428
Becky, look at her butt!

08:48.495 --> 08:49.563
-Becky!
-Becky!

08:49.630 --> 08:52.432
What the f*** is going on
with her butt?

08:52.499 --> 08:54.735
Becky. Becky.

08:56.937 --> 08:57.971
Becky.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.442
No, that's, Becky's the one that we're
trying to get to look at...

09:02.509 --> 09:04.011
-Becky!
-Becky!

09:04.478 --> 09:06.813
-Look at her butt.
-Becky, look at this girl.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.882
That's why she wasn't
responding to "Becky."

09:09.016 --> 09:10.484
That's the girl with the butt.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.186
-Becky!
-Becky!

09:13.921 --> 09:16.190
-Becky! Over there, look.
-Becky! Look!

09:16.256 --> 09:18.392
-Look.
-Get a load of that.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.894
Becky, cop a bit of that, Becky.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.863
-F****** hell.
-F****** hell.

10:03.237 --> 10:04.404
Sing it.

10:36.837 --> 10:39.273
Should we play our Snaps game?

10:39.339 --> 10:40.841
-I'll think of something.
-Yes.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.109
You shut your eyes.

10:42.176 --> 10:45.546
I'll whisper it to the camera,
so they know the name I'm thinking of.

10:45.612 --> 10:48.649
OK, but surely I should do it because
you can't snap because you're driving.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.284
-You're right. OK.
-Right.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.252
-So you...
-I'll cover my ears.

10:54.254 --> 10:57.157
Beyoncé. OK.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.359
-I'm ready.
-OK. Get ready for this, guys.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.827
This is telepathy to another level.

11:03.363 --> 11:06.166
Name of the game is Snaps.
Snaps is the name of the game.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.468
Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.471
This time it isn't.

11:13.407 --> 11:14.608
OK.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.649
Wow. Listen.

11:25.419 --> 11:26.653
Stop.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.855
Beyoncé Knowles.

11:33.093 --> 11:36.597
Crushed it. Shall we do it again because
you might not believe that we did it.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.232
Yeah, can you believe it?

11:38.699 --> 11:39.766
OK.

11:42.769 --> 11:43.937
I'll do...

11:45.138 --> 11:46.306
Jon Snow.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.508
OK, ready.

11:48.442 --> 11:51.311
Name of the game is Snaps.
Snaps is the name of the game.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.114
Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.750
This time... it is.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.360
Now...
the name of the game is Snaps.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.061
Snaps is the name of the game.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.062
Jon Snow.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.900
-Honestly.
-All good.

12:16.703 --> 12:17.771
-BFF
-BFF

12:18.805 --> 12:20.841
-for life, girl.
-for life, girl.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.313
-Bless up.
-Bless up, fam.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.117
I don't think
you can argue with this.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.520
-We have the most loyal fans in the world.
-Indeed.

13:40.087 --> 13:42.623
I like to call them "the sofa-nators."

13:44.191 --> 13:46.927
That is the dumbest s***
I have ever heard, but continue.

13:46.994 --> 13:50.163
Anyway, HBO has got
this big thing for fans.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.466
I'm thinking we're gonna surprise
all of the "Thrones" fans.

13:52.533 --> 13:54.801
-That's an incredible idea.
-Yeah? Let's do it.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.785
-That way?
-Yes.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.387
Here they come.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.257
Get ready.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.825
In three...

14:20.160 --> 14:21.094
Two...

14:22.963 --> 14:24.064
One.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.265
-Winter's coming!
-Winter's coming!

14:25.332 --> 14:26.567
What the hell!

14:28.435 --> 14:30.404
-Hi!
-Hi, guys!

14:30.470 --> 14:31.905
-Winter's coming!
-Winter's coming!

14:33.173 --> 14:34.208
Hi!

14:35.075 --> 14:37.144
-Winter's coming!
-Winter's coming!

14:39.112 --> 14:41.348
What? This is awesome.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.719
So we wanted to make your
Game of Thrones dreams come true.

14:45.786 --> 14:47.654
What's your favourite scene
in Game of Thrones?

14:47.721 --> 14:51.825
-One that would be fun for us to act out.
-Sir Ellen, bring me his head!

14:51.892 --> 14:53.227
Don't do it!

14:55.095 --> 14:56.463
Sword. Pass it along.

14:56.530 --> 14:57.598
King of the North!

14:57.664 --> 14:59.333
We say the Queen of the North.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.035
Queen of the North!

15:02.102 --> 15:04.338
I play Sansa all the time.
Someone else do it.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.373
-I'll be Sansa.
-You can be Sansa.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.876
-This is awesome.
-And action!

15:15.415 --> 15:16.617
Ramsay...

15:17.718 --> 15:20.454
You've messed with me far too long.

15:20.521 --> 15:21.822
Yes.

15:21.889 --> 15:23.957
It's time for you to pay
for what you've done.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.093
I will always be part of you.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.561
You will not be part of me,

15:27.628 --> 15:28.662
but your dogs...

15:29.429 --> 15:31.465
you'll always be a part of them.

15:41.909 --> 15:43.610
Yes!

15:43.677 --> 15:45.445
OK, that was awesome.

15:46.813 --> 15:49.183
Well, today has just been amazing,

15:49.249 --> 15:51.251
and I think we need you guys
to sing us out?

15:51.852 --> 15:53.086
Is that OK?

15:53.453 --> 15:56.557
OK. One, two, three!

16:09.937 --> 16:12.039
-Bye!
-Bye!

16:14.341 --> 16:16.143
Where do we hold...?

16:20.380 --> 16:23.784
Wait, let's do a Daenerys speech.

16:24.785 --> 16:26.887
-Dracarys!
-Dracarys!

16:26.954 --> 16:30.057
Careful, Khaleesi, your dragons are strong

16:30.057 --> 16:31.792
Yeah, you know it, b****.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.230
Dracarys!
