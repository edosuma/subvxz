WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:02.318
Previously
on "The Americans."

00:03.540 --> 00:04.734
Come in.

00:04.740 --> 00:06.537
You have to
help me ﬁnd Emmett

00:06.540 --> 00:09.759
and Leanne's killer,
Andrew Larrick.

00:09.770 --> 00:11.362
Emmett and Leanne
were blackmailing him.

00:11.370 --> 00:13.133
He's homosexual.

00:13.140 --> 00:16.871
To get to Larrick, you'll need
an airtight cover, Brad Mullin,

00:16.880 --> 00:20.372
seaman recruit working out of
Dam Neck in Virginia Beach.

00:20.380 --> 00:21.495
Paige, what is this?

00:21.500 --> 00:22.580
-I'm reading the Bible.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.592
-What is the Reed Street Church?

00:24.600 --> 00:25.874
-I'm allowed to
have my own life.

00:25.880 --> 00:27.620
-And we are allowed
to know about it.

00:27.630 --> 00:29.188
-I'm filling out
this application.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.428
And there's this line here.

00:30.440 --> 00:33.523
And they want my marital
status and my husband's name.

00:33.530 --> 00:35.020
I'm putting your
name down, Clark.

00:35.030 --> 00:37.453
You're my husband,
and it's the truth.

00:37.460 --> 00:41.499
-He is a brilliant physicist
and an eloquent an advocate

00:41.510 --> 00:43.319
for those Jewish
refuseniks still

00:43.330 --> 00:44.638
trapped in the Soviet Union.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.380
-We're taking the scientist.

01:13.960 --> 01:14.654
-Here.

03:11.210 --> 03:13.678
-Is he all right?

03:13.680 --> 03:14.544
-Yeah.

03:14.550 --> 03:15.448
A little wasted.

03:15.460 --> 03:16.154
-Yeah.

03:26.260 --> 03:27.989
- You got to know when

03:27.990 --> 03:30.550
to hold them, know
when to fold them.

03:30.550 --> 03:32.199
Aw, jeez man,
Too much of a good thing.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.840
You know what I'm
saying?

03:35.850 --> 03:37.738
-We had reports of
gunfire in the area.

03:37.750 --> 03:38.614
You see anything?

03:38.620 --> 03:39.314
No.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.298
No, not at all.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.541
I ain't-- It's
Washington, I mean.

03:45.390 --> 03:47.472
-You folks better not get
behind the wheel tonight.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.174
-Yeah.

03:48.180 --> 03:48.976
We won't, officer.

03:48.980 --> 03:49.674
-No.

05:38.790 --> 05:40.906
-Well, I filled it out, Clark.

05:40.910 --> 05:42.684
And I'm assuming since
you didn't call me back,

05:42.690 --> 05:43.952
this is OK with you.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.450
Anyway, you know what time

05:45.460 --> 05:47.234
I leave for work in the morning.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.400
Call me.

05:57.640 --> 05:58.618
Come in.

06:02.030 --> 06:03.952
-Hey, what's up?

06:03.960 --> 06:07.498
-Homework, what do you think?

06:07.500 --> 06:08.956
-What are you reading?

06:08.960 --> 06:09.654
-Don't worry.

06:09.660 --> 06:10.422
It's not the Bible.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.438
-I don't care what
you're reading.

06:17.450 --> 06:20.374
I just-- I don't want
you hiding things.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.116
Hello?

06:38.120 --> 06:40.873
May
I speak with Ms. Jennings?

06:40.880 --> 06:43.280
-This is Mrs. Jennings.

06:43.290 --> 06:46.498
-This is Allan Petrie with
Columbia House Record Club.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.843
I'm calling to discuss
your husband's account,

06:48.850 --> 06:52.217
which is now three
months overdue.

06:55.610 --> 06:58.909
So you'd
rather be here with me

06:58.910 --> 07:02.471
than arrested by the
Washington police.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.916
That's an interesting choice.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.002
Anton's mist_ress
was well-trained.

07:08.010 --> 07:08.829
- No.

07:08.830 --> 07:10.138
-Is that where it hurts?

07:15.520 --> 07:16.282
So what?

07:16.290 --> 07:20.135
Anton wants a playmate,
you get him a playmate?

07:20.140 --> 07:21.812
Throw some shekels his way, too?

07:21.820 --> 07:23.037
Hm?

07:23.040 --> 07:24.598
He couldn't have been
too hard to turn.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.374
I mean, he loves America,
but he loves you, too.

07:33.470 --> 07:34.357
You're almost done.

07:40.980 --> 07:41.674
Mossad.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.241
Know when to hold them.

07:48.250 --> 07:48.944
What are you?

07:48.950 --> 07:49.917
The Kenny Rogers of Tel Aviv?

07:51.930 --> 07:52.624
-Haifa.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.098
I'm cold.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.579
-Yeah, you're in shock.

07:57.590 --> 07:58.761
-You took jacket.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.089
It's cold in here.

08:00.100 --> 08:00.839
You see?

08:00.850 --> 08:01.544
Icicles.

08:04.890 --> 08:06.642
-So is this what you Jews do?

08:06.650 --> 08:08.857
You spy on your friends?

08:08.860 --> 08:10.578
-America isn't a friend.

08:10.580 --> 08:13.140
America's a father.

08:13.140 --> 08:17.099
He thinks we're not ready
to drive his fast car.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.170
So sometimes when
he's not looking,

08:19.180 --> 08:21.262
we get behind the wheel.

08:21.270 --> 08:22.817
We take it for a spin.

08:30.860 --> 08:31.679
-Hey.

08:31.690 --> 08:32.520
-Hey.

08:38.970 --> 08:41.598
-That's pretty good.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.488
-Well, they say
that drawing helps

08:43.500 --> 08:45.343
you find the parts of
yourself that you lost.

08:48.070 --> 08:49.219
-Is that an EST thing?

08:49.220 --> 08:49.914
-No.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.081
Soul retrieval.

08:52.090 --> 08:53.933
-Soul retrieval?

08:53.940 --> 08:59.515
-Yeah, a friend of mine
told me about it from EST.

08:59.520 --> 09:00.851
-Making new friends.

09:04.340 --> 09:05.068
Hello?

09:05.070 --> 09:06.469
It's Jim Halliwell.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.174
-Sir?

09:07.180 --> 09:09.159
Got
a call from campus security

09:09.160 --> 09:10.297
at GW.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.370
_ One of their
SCIentlsts, hIS says

09:12.380 --> 09:14.291
he hasn't come home tonight.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.689
There's a note in his
file that says to call us

09:16.700 --> 09:18.679
if anything suspicious
happens with him.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.193
-What field's he in?

09:20.200 --> 09:21.974
Physics.

09:21.980 --> 09:24.722
Look, I hate to ruin
your night, but, uh,

09:24.730 --> 09:27.995
with what happened last year, I
hear "scientist" and I figure--

09:28.000 --> 09:29.319
-You're absolutely right.
I'm on my way in.

09:29.330 --> 09:30.524
Very good.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.048
-I came as soon as I got word.

10:12.060 --> 10:13.334
I'm Kate, Claudia's replacement.

10:16.130 --> 10:17.097
-What do you have?

10:17.100 --> 10:17.782
-Food.

10:17.790 --> 10:18.757
Medical supplies.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.204
-Put them here.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.796
-I'm honored to work with you.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.598
- Keep
your voice down.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.261
- I will do
my best to a55|st you.

10:35.270 --> 10:35.964
-Your best?

10:35.970 --> 10:36.709
What is this?

10:36.720 --> 10:38.665
Your first assignment?

10:38.670 --> 10:40.058
-C|audi_a was the most
experienced handler

10:40.060 --> 10:41.789
and director at EST, and
you found her unacceptable.

10:41.790 --> 10:45.009
The Centre wants you happy.

10:45.010 --> 10:46.113
I want you happy.

10:49.980 --> 10:52.869
-We're one block from
where we took him.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.620
And we've been
seen by the police.

10:54.630 --> 10:57.349
I have a Mossad agent
in the other room.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.442
I'm not interested in your best.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.144
I need results.

11:00.150 --> 11:01.299
So start by getting
me a new safe house.

11:01.300 --> 11:01.994
OK.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.332
-And tell the Centre if they
want Baklanov, Moscow'll have

11:04.340 --> 11:05.432
to make a deal
with the Israelis.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.452
-I'll let them now right away.

11:06.460 --> 11:07.154
-Good.

11:14.810 --> 11:16.368
So tired of being jerked

11:16.380 --> 11:17.950
around by that murdering savage.

11:17.960 --> 11:18.858
Joyce.

11:18.860 --> 11:20.828
I have
to be honest about it, Frank.

11:20.830 --> 11:22.957
I want to see Harmon punished to
the absolute limit of the law.

11:23.730 --> 11:25.539
I want revenge for Pamela.

11:25.550 --> 11:28.053
Frank, I don't know if I
want to do my job any--

11:33.250 --> 11:34.023
-Jennifer.

11:34.030 --> 11:35.065
Hi.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.037
-Is he here?

11:36.040 --> 11:36.734
-Who?

11:36.740 --> 11:37.741
Clark?

11:37.750 --> 11:39.206
-He's not, is he?

11:39.210 --> 11:41.121
I can't believe him.

11:41.130 --> 11:44.964
I mean, it's just--
it's so rude.

11:44.970 --> 11:48.189
-Um, would you like to come in?

11:48.190 --> 11:49.532
-I hate barging in
on you like this.

11:49.540 --> 11:50.234
-No.

11:50.240 --> 11:50.945
No, please.

11:50.950 --> 11:53.054
Please come in.

11:53.060 --> 11:56.097
I was just, um-- Would
you like a glass of wine?

11:56.100 --> 11:57.089
-Oh, sure.

11:57.090 --> 11:57.784
-Yes?

11:57.790 --> 12:01.658
I have white and-- and white.

12:01.660 --> 12:03.218
That sounds great.

12:03.220 --> 12:04.244
You know, I should have called.

12:04.250 --> 12:04.944
I really should have.

12:04.950 --> 12:06.372
But I realised it's crazy.

12:06.380 --> 12:07.904
I do not have your phone number.

12:07.910 --> 12:09.081
And you're not listed.

12:09.090 --> 12:11.354
-Well, it still
under my maiden name.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.349
Oh.

12:12.350 --> 12:14.215
Luckily, I had your address.

12:14.220 --> 12:17.132
But, um, you know, it's
just so typical Clark.

12:17.140 --> 12:20.359
So he didn't mention-- Did
you even know I was in town?

12:20.360 --> 12:21.145
-No.

12:21.150 --> 12:22.378
Thank you.

12:22.390 --> 12:23.869
I guess it was a
little bit last minute.

12:23.870 --> 12:24.950
I got in yesterday.

12:24.960 --> 12:25.927
I'm staying at his apartment.

12:25.930 --> 12:26.624
-Oh.

12:26.630 --> 12:27.870
-And he mentioned
that we would all

12:27.880 --> 12:30.952
get together tonight,
the three of us.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.723
And then he goes
and pulls a Clark.

12:32.730 --> 12:34.379
-That's didn't show up?

12:34.380 --> 12:35.074
Or?

12:35.080 --> 12:36.593
-Didn't even call.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.680
-Huh.

12:37.690 --> 12:38.384
-So I'm there.

12:38.390 --> 12:38.879
I'm waiting.

12:38.890 --> 12:39.709
Thank you.

12:39.720 --> 12:40.470
And waiting.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.380
And then I hear
your phone messages.

12:42.390 --> 12:43.084
-Oh.

12:43.090 --> 12:45.274
-And I just felt awful.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.030
-You're very sweet.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.849
-No, I couldn't stand
another second of it.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.954
So, is it OK that I'm here?

12:49.960 --> 12:51.279
You would tell me, right?

12:51.290 --> 12:52.939
-You know, I'm
glad that you came.

12:52.950 --> 12:54.611
I think-- I think I was
getting a little crazy.

12:54.620 --> 12:55.314
So--

12:55.320 --> 12:58.357
-We||, Clark can do that,
make a person crazy.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.511
I mean, I love him to death,
but my lord.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.465
-Is he like that with you, too?

13:03.470 --> 13:05.745
-Oh, he's like that
with everybody.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.524
I mean, he's such
a great, great guy.

13:07.530 --> 13:10.363
But he's just missing
that one little thing.

13:10.370 --> 13:11.803
You know what I mean?

13:11.810 --> 13:12.606
-I do.

13:12.610 --> 13:13.304
I do.

13:13.310 --> 13:14.004
-Yeah.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.945
It's just those
few missing notes

13:16.950 --> 13:19.089
when it comes to social graces.

13:19.100 --> 13:19.794
Yeah.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.507
He's always been that way.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.592
If I'm saying too much, you're
going to stop me, right?

13:24.600 --> 13:25.658
-No, no, no.

13:25.660 --> 13:27.218
Believe me, I'm
dying now to know.

13:27.220 --> 13:27.914
Dying.

13:33.650 --> 13:34.924
-According this Mrs.
Baklanov, the guy

13:34.930 --> 13:37.444
didn't have that much of a
social life-- family, temple,

13:37.450 --> 13:38.144
bath house.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.219
That's about it.

13:39.230 --> 13:40.322
-Who doesn't_love
a good schVItz?

13:40.330 --> 13:41.888
-She's not too clear on
the details of his work

13:41.900 --> 13:44.425
but says he claims to be a
real-life David Copperfield.

13:44.430 --> 13:46.000
-What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

13:46.010 --> 13:47.022
-Makes things invisible.

13:47.030 --> 13:47.962
That's all I got.

13:47.970 --> 13:48.994
-Where do you want us to start?

13:49.000 --> 13:49.762
-Phone records.

13:49.770 --> 13:51.442
Already got the last week's
worth from his office,

13:51.450 --> 13:54.123
data from any place he might
have been the last few days.

13:54.130 --> 13:56.701
His wife gave me a list.

14:03.060 --> 14:05.199
We don't
have those-- icicles.

14:13.330 --> 14:16.584
Never saw them until
I was posted here.

14:16.590 --> 14:18.512
After an ice storm, you
see them in the trees.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.192
Hanging.

14:20.200 --> 14:23.158
You probably had that back
home, didn't you, Mr. KGB Man?

14:26.630 --> 14:28.109
-I don't remember.

14:34.550 --> 14:36.142
Even
so, I'd rather

14:36.150 --> 14:38.198
die with a view of
the Mediterranean.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.734
Not that we get to
pick and choose.

14:47.780 --> 14:52.069
It was supposed to be an
easy posting, America.

14:52.070 --> 14:53.685
-Nothing's easy.

14:53.690 --> 14:54.486
Very true.

14:57.020 --> 15:00.649
My mother, she-- she
survived the pogroms.

15:00.660 --> 15:02.571
A tough guy sent
from the kibbutz

15:02.580 --> 15:03.899
can't even survive Washington.

15:03.900 --> 15:05.595
-You're not dead yet.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.204
-Ah, I've got a fever.

15:07.210 --> 15:07.949
I can feel it.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.520
I'm-- I'm talking
like I have a fever.

15:13.160 --> 15:17.529
Anyway, a few hours from now,
you put a bullet in my head.

15:17.540 --> 15:21.089
-We'll make a deal.

15:21.090 --> 15:25.481
-I can't tell if you're
being kind or naive.

15:25.490 --> 15:26.366
-We get what we want.

15:26.370 --> 15:27.678
We want Anton.

15:27.680 --> 15:32.185
So if we can't find him,
we trade you for him.

15:32.190 --> 15:34.499
-Would your government
make that trade for you?

15:38.920 --> 15:40.831
-I don't know.

15:40.840 --> 15:41.534
-Me?

15:41.540 --> 15:43.246
I know.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.365
I'm not being modest.

15:44.370 --> 15:47.225
I'm worth something.

15:47.230 --> 15:49.334
But I'm bronze, not platinum.

15:49.340 --> 15:51.695
Not like you.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.485
I go home for Passover.

15:55.060 --> 15:59.099
I sing country western
with an accent.

15:59.100 --> 16:01.489
I hide what I do.

16:01.490 --> 16:03.697
I don't hide who I am.

16:11.990 --> 16:14.003
-Oh, it's empty.

16:14.010 --> 16:15.898
Now, should I open another?

16:15.900 --> 16:16.867
-Why not?

16:16.870 --> 16:19.862
-Yeah, why not?

16:19.870 --> 16:23.089
So did Clark tell you
about the job application?

16:23.090 --> 16:28.949
-Um, no, but, um, I
heard your messages.

16:28.950 --> 16:31.544
And I know he's pretty
serious about that stuff.

16:31.550 --> 16:32.653
-He sure is.

16:32.660 --> 16:35.015
You know, that's
what I'm going to do.

16:35.020 --> 16:36.044
-What?

16:36.050 --> 16:37.506
-I'm going to hand
it in "Married."

16:37.510 --> 16:38.579
Check.

16:38.590 --> 16:39.909
Where is the corkscrew?

16:39.920 --> 16:41.319
Ah.

16:41.330 --> 16:42.206
"Husband."

16:42.210 --> 16:43.359
Clark Westerfeld.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.804
Double check.

16:44.810 --> 16:46.562
"Husband's occupation?"

16:46.570 --> 16:50.131
Hall monitor for
the goddamn FBI.

16:50.140 --> 16:51.107
-Martha?

16:51.110 --> 16:53.533
Can I be a little bit
of Betty Buttinsky?

16:53.540 --> 16:54.234
-Yes, Jennifer.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.650
You're family.

16:55.660 --> 16:56.945
-I just-- I know Clark.

16:56.950 --> 16:58.565
And I know how much
his job means to him.

16:58.570 --> 16:59.264
-Right.

16:59.270 --> 17:00.180
I'm his wife.

17:00.190 --> 17:02.909
I should be mean more to
him than some dumb job.

17:02.910 --> 17:03.604
-And you do.

17:03.610 --> 17:04.417
I know you do.

17:04.420 --> 17:11.542
But-- It's none of my business.

17:11.550 --> 17:13.120
-No, you know what?

17:13.130 --> 17:14.916
OK.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.000
Go ahead.

17:16.010 --> 17:17.489
-It's just not some dumb job.

17:17.500 --> 17:20.151
You know that, probably
more than I do.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.151
And if you check
"married," then they'll

17:22.160 --> 17:23.331
do a background on Clark.

17:23.340 --> 17:24.523
And he's not allowed
to be married

17:27.110 --> 17:27.804
-I know.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.726
I suppose it's not like
me lying on the form would

17:33.730 --> 17:36.563
get me thrown in
gaol or anything.

17:36.570 --> 17:42.861
-Martha, he loves you so much.

17:45.980 --> 17:49.450
-He does, doesn't he?

17:49.460 --> 17:51.314
-And you love him.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.150
-I do.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.264
I really do.

17:54.270 --> 17:56.636
It's just he's so--

17:56.640 --> 17:57.675
-Exasperating.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.454
-Yes.

17:59.460 --> 18:01.371
God, you're easy to
talk to, you know?

18:01.380 --> 18:02.961
-I'm really surprised.

18:03.870 --> 18:05.497
-Hey!

18:05.500 --> 18:06.194
-Oh, no.

18:06.200 --> 18:06.905
Sorry.

18:06.910 --> 18:09.105
If just I'm in
Clark, so uptight.

18:09.110 --> 18:11.954
You know, like fuss, fussy, fussy.

18:12.950 --> 18:16.010
Well, you know,
except more, you know.

18:16.020 --> 18:17.260
Oh, no, how would you know?

18:17.270 --> 18:19.704
Of course, you don't know.

18:19.710 --> 18:21.359
-Oh, you mean-- Oh.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.054
Oh.

18:22.060 --> 18:22.754
-You know what?

18:22.760 --> 18:24.671
I'm gonna-- I'm going to
let you in on a little

18:24.680 --> 18:26.989
secret about your
very big brother.

18:26.990 --> 18:27.672
-Oh.

18:27.680 --> 18:28.374
-OK?

18:28.380 --> 18:29.449
He's an animal.

18:29.460 --> 18:30.279
-Oh.

18:30.290 --> 18:30.984
really?

18:30.990 --> 18:31.456
-Rea|ly.

18:31.460 --> 18:32.279
Oh, my god.

18:32.280 --> 18:33.087
Oh, my god, Jennifer.

18:33.090 --> 18:33.840
Oh, my god.

18:33.850 --> 18:35.750
But it's-- uh, I mean, it's
not like I've been with

18:35.760 --> 18:37.239
a thousand guys or
anything, right?

18:37.240 --> 18:38.889
But I've been with
enough to compare hIm to.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.209
And let me tell you, he's wild.

18:41.220 --> 18:41.959
-Wow.

18:41.970 --> 18:42.664
-Yeah.

18:42.670 --> 18:45.104
I don‘t even know
where It comes from.

18:45.110 --> 18:46.964
Some of the things he does?

18:46.970 --> 18:47.709
-Hm.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.563
- Oh!

18:50.270 --> 18:56.960
-What, um-- What does he do?

18:56.970 --> 19:00.861
-Oh, he, um-- No, your
brother, he's a gentleman.

19:00.870 --> 19:02.872
He's a gentleman.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.472
It's just not in the sack.

19:04.480 --> 19:11.420
In the sack, he-- he
just makes me his.

19:11.430 --> 19:12.124
-Hm.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.390
-I got a shots fired in Shaw.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.220
Anybody have any calls
out on the board, yet?

20:32.230 --> 20:32.924
Brooks?

20:32.930 --> 20:34.227
-No.

20:34.230 --> 20:35.003
-Loeb?

20:35.010 --> 20:36.329
-Nothing.

20:36.340 --> 20:39.696
-Agent Gaad, what
brings you here?

20:39.700 --> 20:42.669
-I heard a physicist with
a clearance went missing.

20:42.670 --> 20:43.398
Thought I could help.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.424
I called him, sir.

20:46.820 --> 20:47.514
-All right.

20:50.060 --> 20:53.234
Beeman, why don't
you give him a stack?

20:53.240 --> 20:54.366
-What've you got?

20:54.370 --> 20:57.954
Anton Baklanov told
his wife he'd be home by 7:30.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.336
Signed out of his
office at 5:00.

20:59.340 --> 21:00.227
-No one's heard from him?

21:00.230 --> 21:00.980
-No, sir.

21:00.990 --> 21:02.150
These are records
from any phone he

21:02.160 --> 21:03.718
might have used in
the last few days.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.280
If a number shows up on
more than one phone or more

21:06.280 --> 21:08.259
than one day, that's a blue pin.

21:08.270 --> 21:12.309
Red are disturbance calls to
MPDC after 5:00 PM tonight.

21:12.310 --> 21:14.358
If blue and red show
up on the same place--

21:14.360 --> 21:15.281
-Got it.

21:18.590 --> 21:20.603
I'd forgotten the
heart-stopping thrills.

21:20.610 --> 21:22.157
-Plus we've got the
vending machines.

21:59.530 --> 22:00.224
-Hey.

22:03.220 --> 22:06.826
Halliwell wasn't too
happy I came around.

22:06.830 --> 22:08.422
-He just didn't expect you.

22:08.430 --> 22:09.579
-I know the look.

22:09.580 --> 22:11.229
I've used it myself.

22:11.230 --> 22:12.094
"Make yourself at home.

22:12.100 --> 22:15.331
Just stay out of my way."

22:15.340 --> 22:17.467
-So I talked to the chairman
about Baklanov's department

22:17.470 --> 22:18.721
at GW.

22:18.730 --> 22:21.039
He said he was working on some
kind of government contracts.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.826
But he didn't know
anything about it.

22:22.830 --> 22:24.969
-Let me put on my
big surprise face.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.506
-So I asked our guys
downstairs where

22:26.510 --> 22:29.673
the notification order
on Baklanov came from.

22:29.680 --> 22:32.820
Took them two hours
to dIg up an answer.

22:32.830 --> 22:35.310
Came from DOD.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.675
I called over there, but,
I mean, how long do you

22:37.680 --> 22:40.649
think it's going to
take them to back to me?

22:40.650 --> 22:42.515
-So I'm not here to help
you go through crime

22:42.520 --> 22:44.693
reports and phone records?

22:44.700 --> 22:48.033
-Hardly, sir.

22:48.040 --> 22:50.179
-Let me see what I can find out.

22:56.540 --> 22:57.404
Mr. KGB Man.

23:07.900 --> 23:08.787
I need to shit.

23:30.970 --> 23:31.880
I need some help.

24:02.490 --> 24:05.948
You think you could leave
me alone for a minute?

24:05.960 --> 24:08.679
-Is that what you'd do?

24:17.860 --> 24:19.612
Oh.

25:15.930 --> 25:17.079
-Sorry.

25:17.090 --> 25:19.923
You know I had to try.

25:19.930 --> 25:20.624
-Yeah.

27:40.410 --> 27:42.947
-Stan.

27:42.950 --> 27:44.975
I called DOD security.

27:44.980 --> 27:47.881
Then I went over there,
talked to the duty officer,

27:47.890 --> 27:49.778
made him wake up the
lieutenant in charge.

27:49.780 --> 27:51.463
He got some colonel
somewhere to pull the file.

27:51.470 --> 27:52.164
-And?

27:52.170 --> 27:53.364
-Stonewalled.

27:53.370 --> 27:55.110
It's like I'm the KGB.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.428
He said it's codeword clearance.

27:56.430 --> 27:57.704
And I don't have it.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.018
Whatever he's
working on, they sure

27:59.020 --> 27:59.941
don't want to talk about it.

27:59.950 --> 28:02.202
-Well, he's been missing
for over 12 hours now.

28:02.210 --> 28:04.178
So I'm guessing that
somebody talked about it.

28:22.180 --> 28:23.169
-Hey.

28:23.180 --> 28:25.045
-I got 'em.

28:25.050 --> 28:28.338
I copied every single
file on the bastard.

28:28.340 --> 28:29.329
-Thank you.

28:43.670 --> 28:44.364
Stop.

28:52.300 --> 28:57.954
You know,
after it happened,

28:57.960 --> 29:05.776
I just, um-- It's
taking me a while

29:05.780 --> 29:09.409
to start feeling things again.

29:09.410 --> 29:12.994
_It's _the most natural
thing In the world, right?

29:13.000 --> 29:15.104
Feeling things?

29:15.110 --> 29:17.317
I don't know why it's so hard.

29:21.770 --> 29:25.536
But it's something that I
need to learn all over again.

29:30.430 --> 29:32.386
I'm just too old.

29:32.390 --> 29:33.846
-You're not too old.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.539
I'm not going to
see you again, am I?

29:55.310 --> 29:59.542
-I don't have
anything to give you.

29:59.550 --> 30:00.608
I wish that I did.

30:07.050 --> 30:08.529
-I hope you get what you need.

30:12.000 --> 30:12.989
-Thank you.

30:32.290 --> 30:34.918
-I missed you.

30:34.920 --> 30:35.614
-Nina.

30:35.620 --> 30:36.018
-Mm.

30:36.020 --> 30:36.418
Mm.

30:36.420 --> 30:37.307
-Nina.

30:37.310 --> 30:38.277
-I missed it.

30:38.280 --> 30:39.998
-What's-- what's
happening there today?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.228
Have you noticed anything?

30:41.230 --> 30:42.902
-Arkady's sending many cables.

30:42.910 --> 30:44.525
There's lots of closed doors.

30:44.530 --> 30:47.624
-Did you hear anything about
an operation to grab somebody?

30:47.630 --> 30:49.598
Maybe a scientist?

30:49.600 --> 30:52.114
-Oleg and Arkady were fighting.

30:52.120 --> 30:54.577
Oleg is Line X Science
and Technology.

30:54.580 --> 30:59.870
I heard him say to another
officer, um, oh, we let him go,

30:59.880 --> 31:01.802
we can take him back.

31:01.810 --> 31:03.903
I don't know what
they're talking about.

31:03.910 --> 31:05.309
Could be about a scientist.

31:05.320 --> 31:08.221
-Well, if Arkady doesn't want
to take him, you don't take him.

31:08.230 --> 31:10.141
Oleg is impatient.

31:10.150 --> 31:13.130
He has a lot of important
people in Moscow.

31:13.140 --> 31:16.268
-Well, is Arkady running
the Rezidentura or isn't he?

31:16.270 --> 31:19.535
-Oleg says Arkady thinks
like a bureaucrat.

31:19.540 --> 31:24.477
He told me, you can't beat the
Americans thinking that way.

31:32.580 --> 31:33.672
Water.

31:33.680 --> 31:34.999
Water.

31:55.830 --> 32:14.318
Now back home,
we live in the woods.

32:14.330 --> 32:17.572
My kids eat in a communal hall.

32:17.580 --> 32:19.980
My wife works in the
fields with other wives.

32:22.610 --> 32:24.430
You like communism?

32:24.440 --> 32:25.543
Come to Israel.

32:25.550 --> 32:28.747
It works much better there.

32:30.230 --> 32:32.676
-Yeah.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.592
A very cold
place, the Soviet Union.

32:38.860 --> 32:39.940
-I like the cold.

32:43.270 --> 32:44.567
-Ha.

32:44.570 --> 32:46.526
You miss it.

32:46.530 --> 32:48.782
You really miss it.

32:48.790 --> 32:50.234
Hm.

32:50.240 --> 32:53.027
Unbelievable.

33:09.530 --> 33:11.145
-Did you get me
a new safe house?

33:11.150 --> 33:13.971
-You don't need one.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.022
-Here's what I found out.

33:19.030 --> 33:21.908
This guy Oleg Burov,
he runs Line X,

33:21.910 --> 33:23.354
the tech line with
the Rezidentura.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.328
He's having a
brouhaha with Arkady.

33:25.330 --> 33:26.501
-You think they've got Baklanov?

33:26.510 --> 33:27.932
-I think they're going
to try to exfiltrate

33:27.940 --> 33:29.578
him against his well.

33:29.580 --> 33:31.468
But this Oleg
might just be coclq

33:31.470 --> 33:33.233
enough to lead us right
what we want to go.

33:52.480 --> 33:53.890
Your
government made a deal.

33:59.740 --> 34:00.479
There's a car outside.

34:39.030 --> 34:40.566
-Target headed
north on Wisconsin.

34:40.570 --> 34:42.686
Two, pick up.

34:42.690 --> 34:43.702
-Two, approaching Wisconsin.

35:06.260 --> 35:07.477
-Three, going
north on Fort Hunt.

35:17.960 --> 35:19.951
-Two, north on Arlington.

35:24.950 --> 35:27.441
Picking up Two.

35:27.450 --> 35:29.077
Four
cutting east to Leland.

35:54.800 --> 35:57.314
-Three, pick him up on 43rd.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.959
Four, try Massachusetts.

35:59.970 --> 36:01.176
-Anything alerting?

36:01.180 --> 36:02.306
Not really.

36:17.190 --> 36:19.579
-What's going on?

36:19.580 --> 36:21.445
What's happening?

36:21.450 --> 36:22.667
Etai, eh?

36:22.670 --> 36:23.659
-Everything will be all right.

36:33.170 --> 36:35.923
-He's on 295 heading north.

36:35.930 --> 36:37.067
-I'll take him
back at Colesville.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.788
Three, stay on surface roads.

36:38.790 --> 36:39.859
Four, where are you?

36:39.860 --> 36:41.157
One, heading north.

36:41.160 --> 36:46.188
-Stay 'til Laurel, then 216.

36:46.190 --> 36:47.088
-I'm a Jew.

36:47.100 --> 36:49.159
Can't help lingering on ironies.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.458
There's a man you're
sending on to Russia.

36:51.460 --> 36:54.349
Funny, I don't think he
very much wants to go.

36:54.360 --> 36:58.012
And you, after you put him
on the slow boat to hell--

36:58.020 --> 36:59.282
-He'll be well treated.

36:59.290 --> 37:02.054
-You will go home
to your family.

37:02.060 --> 37:03.709
Is "home" the right word?

37:06.850 --> 37:07.544
-Enough.

37:11.430 --> 37:14.297
-Is that your wife
I met earlier?

37:14.300 --> 37:17.679
The one that delighted in
beating the crap out of me.

37:17.680 --> 37:19.534
What a nice bed you must
have to sleep in at night.

37:19.540 --> 37:22.703
-It's not too late
for me to kill you.

37:22.710 --> 37:25.895
-Where am I going?

37:25.900 --> 37:28.698
You said I would be safe.

37:28.710 --> 37:29.768
We spent the night together.

37:29.770 --> 37:32.580
We don't know even
know each other's name.

37:32.590 --> 37:35.297
But your name isn't
your name, is it?

37:35.300 --> 37:38.053
Is your face your face?

37:38.060 --> 37:39.755
Are your children your children?

37:56.380 --> 37:57.085
-Oh, wait.

37:57.090 --> 37:57.897
Why?

37:57.900 --> 37:58.594
Why?

37:58.600 --> 38:00.875
No, you can't do this!

38:00.880 --> 38:02.871
Where are you taking me?

38:02.880 --> 38:04.142
Help me!

38:04.150 --> 38:04.832
-Quiet.

38:09.490 --> 38:10.969
You'll be home for
Passover after all.

38:16.850 --> 38:17.828
-No.

38:17.830 --> 38:19.582
Etai!

38:19.590 --> 38:20.284
Etai!

38:20.290 --> 38:22.508
You promised!

38:22.520 --> 38:23.976
You promised me!

38:36.400 --> 38:37.128
You gonna kill me?

38:40.100 --> 38:42.944
I have a right to know.

38:42.950 --> 38:44.895
-I'm not going to kill you.

38:49.800 --> 38:53.133
-You want me to work for you?

38:53.140 --> 38:54.084
-Not for me.

38:54.090 --> 38:55.580
-No, of course.

38:55.590 --> 38:58.605
You-- you're just
obeying orders.

38:58.610 --> 38:59.304
Like Eichmann.

39:02.860 --> 39:05.806
You're going to send me
back to Russia, is that it?

39:05.810 --> 39:09.746
Listen, I'||-- I'||-- I'll--
I'll- I'll be of no use there.

39:09.750 --> 39:12.207
I'll, uh-- How can I
work in a place I've

39:12.210 --> 39:14.292
spent my life trying to escape?

39:14.300 --> 39:14.994
Huh?

39:15.000 --> 39:17.719
My wife, my son,
you think I'm going

39:17.720 --> 39:19.597
to work 5,000 miles
away from my family?

39:19.600 --> 39:20.419
-You're adaptable.

39:20.420 --> 39:22.308
You've proven that much.

39:28.030 --> 39:30.248
-Let me work for you from here.

39:30.250 --> 39:32.059
Eh?

39:32.060 --> 39:34.574
I have my lab, my resources.

39:34.580 --> 39:35.842
I'll give you things
your government

39:35.850 --> 39:37.488
hasn't even dreamed of.

39:37.490 --> 39:40.197
ECM, you know what that means?

39:40.200 --> 39:42.145
Electronic Counter Measures.

39:42.150 --> 39:44.892
Radar, infrared, lasers--
they can all be deceived.

39:44.900 --> 39:48.347
I can give this to you.

39:48.350 --> 39:49.726
I'll put you on the ARPANET.

39:49.730 --> 39:52.278
This you don't have
in the Soviet Union.

39:52.280 --> 39:52.974
Please.

39:56.990 --> 39:58.958
Don't send me back there.

39:58.960 --> 40:00.075
Please don't send me back.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.116
Please.

40:02.120 --> 40:03.132
I don't want to go back.

40:03.140 --> 40:04.539
Please.

40:04.540 --> 40:07.498
Please
don't send me back.

40:10.240 --> 40:10.934
Please.

40:22.230 --> 40:22.924
-Got him.

40:22.930 --> 40:25.888
Exited 295 on Bypass Road
outside of Baltimore.

40:25.890 --> 40:27.687
Headed north on Keith Avenue.

40:32.120 --> 40:33.144
-You have a family?

40:36.190 --> 40:39.762
My son's bar mitzvah
is in three months.

40:39.770 --> 40:41.647
Give me that.

40:41.650 --> 40:44.949
Three months.

40:44.950 --> 40:47.396
Let his father stand with
him for his coming of age.

40:50.690 --> 40:51.884
Please.

40:51.890 --> 40:53.130
They think I died.

40:53.140 --> 40:53.879
They'll never know.

40:59.880 --> 41:05.568
At least look at me.

41:05.570 --> 41:06.446
Oh, please.

41:10.880 --> 41:14.236
You're a monster.

41:14.240 --> 41:16.811
You're not a man.

41:16.820 --> 41:19.004
Whatever you once
were, whoever you were,

41:19.010 --> 41:20.921
they trained it out of you.

41:20.930 --> 41:23.160
No feeling, no humanity.

41:23.170 --> 41:24.171
You may as well be dead.

41:26.930 --> 41:35.349
Oh, please.

41:40.120 --> 41:40.814
Please.

42:03.810 --> 42:04.504
-You OK?

42:08.040 --> 42:10.873
-It's not all you.

42:10.880 --> 42:15.283
IfI am reading the Bible, going
into youth group, it's not you.

42:15.290 --> 42:16.245
It's me.

42:22.020 --> 42:29.700
My life, my crazy life, I don't
know where to put everything.

42:29.710 --> 42:30.711
-What do you mean?

42:30.720 --> 42:31.414
1--

42:38.790 --> 42:40.269
-Uh, forget it.

42:40.280 --> 42:42.646
It's just-- It's not your fault.

42:42.650 --> 42:43.503
That's all.

43:21.680 --> 43:23.671
-Target entered
Port of Baltimore.

43:23.680 --> 43:24.977
Two, take Dundalk.

43:24.980 --> 43:26.208
Four, Amports.

43:26.220 --> 43:28.097
Three, Fairfield.

43:28.100 --> 43:28.794
I've got Seagirt.

44:40.260 --> 44:40.954
-Agent Beeman.

44:53.690 --> 44:56.534
You must know who I am as well.

44:56.540 --> 44:58.474
Oleg Igorevich Burov.

44:58.480 --> 45:01.324
I noticed you on my
tail an hour ago.

45:01.330 --> 45:05.073
Did you think I would lead
you somewhere interesting?

45:05.080 --> 45:06.126
Where are your colleagues?

45:06.130 --> 45:07.210
I saw them, too.

45:07.220 --> 45:08.938
-Where is Anton Baklanov?

45:08.940 --> 45:10.760
-Who?

45:10.770 --> 45:13.159
Are you going to shoot me?

45:13.160 --> 45:15.276
I am a diplomat, a
guest in your country.

45:19.090 --> 45:19.852
-Turn around.

45:19.860 --> 45:21.157
-I'm here to talk
about Nina Sergeevna.

45:24.120 --> 45:25.849
This is a unique
opportunity for us.

45:34.330 --> 45:35.774
Here we are.

45:38.690 --> 45:41.488
Put the gun away.

45:41.500 --> 45:45.539
Nina is in such great risk.

45:45.540 --> 45:46.996
-What are you talking about?

45:47.000 --> 45:48.729
-Please.

45:48.740 --> 45:51.834
No one else knows that
you're running her.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.751
Not yet.

45:53.760 --> 45:56.376
I'm the only one.

45:56.380 --> 45:58.792
That's what matters.

45:58.800 --> 46:03.339
No, I didn't tell anybody at the
Rezidentura what I figured out.

46:03.340 --> 46:08.323
I'm a-- a budding
student of capitalism.

46:08.330 --> 46:11.276
Everything has a value.

46:11.280 --> 46:15.569
Everything can be traded, yes?

46:15.580 --> 46:19.755
So, let's make a deal.

46:19.760 --> 46:25.312
What can you give me in
exchange for Nina's safety?

46:33.570 --> 46:34.548
We'll talk again.

48:04.060 --> 48:05.709
Weinberger informed Congress

48:05.720 --> 48:08.518
that the administration plans
to ask for appropriations

48:08.520 --> 48:13.992
in the 1983 budget totally
nearly $260 billion.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.161
And in a development
that seems to have taken

48:16.170 --> 48:19.355
American officials by
surprise, the Soviet Union

48:19.360 --> 48:21.920
has granted the
request of 1,500 Soviet

48:21.920 --> 48:24.229
Jews to emigrate to Israel.

48:24.230 --> 48:26.585
No official word yet on
what led to the release

48:26.590 --> 48:29.639
of the so-called
refuseniks, but a spokesman

48:29.640 --> 48:31.380
for the Israeli
embassy called it

48:31.390 --> 48:34.564
a welcome development and
some government leaders

48:34.570 --> 48:38.062
expressed hope this might be a
sign that the Soviet Union is

48:38.070 --> 48:39.879
changing its stance
on human rights.

49:39.780 --> 49:42.738
-Is he gone?

49:42.740 --> 49:43.434
-Yeah.

49:54.080 --> 49:56.093
-It's fun dealing
with your wife.

49:59.380 --> 50:02.952
Clark has some explaining to do.

50:02.960 --> 50:03.642
-Ah.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.631
I'll let him know.

50:20.620 --> 50:33.658
Were there icicles
in Smolensk in the winter?

50:37.350 --> 50:38.044
-Yeah.

50:43.210 --> 50:43.904
What?

50:47.110 --> 50:47.804
-Nothing.

50:51.230 --> 50:52.970
We used to have sword
fights with them.

50:58.220 --> 51:02.532
7When our train was
pulling away from Moscow,

51:02.540 --> 51:05.407
there were icicles on the trees.

51:24.480 --> 51:25.469
-I remember.

51:33.870 --> 51:37.328
-They're up.

51:37.330 --> 51:38.308
-Another day.

51:40.830 --> 51:42.320
Mom.

51:42.330 --> 51:43.820
What did you do with
my green-striped top?

51:49.830 --> 51:50.626
Mom?

51:50.630 --> 51:51.324
Dad?
