20:19.042 --> 20:20.625
A PLAN, I SAID!

20:20.708 --> 20:22.292
I CAN'T, EDDY!

20:22.375 --> 20:23.792
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU CAN'T?

20:23.875 --> 20:25.750
BECAUSE I DESPERATELY
NEED TO USE THE LAVATORY--

20:25.833 --> 20:29.333
AN UNFORTUNATE REACTION
TO THE STRESSFUL
SITUATION, I'M SURE.

20:29.417 --> 20:31.500
YOU STILL
GOT ME, EDDY.

20:31.583 --> 20:34.833
BOY, AIN'T I LUCKY?

20:36.083 --> 20:38.250
[JIMMY HUMMING]

20:43.167 --> 20:44.167
BOY JIMMY...

20:44.250 --> 20:46.000
WHEN MIGHT YOU
BE GOING HOME?

20:46.083 --> 20:47.000
Eddy: HOLY COW!

20:47.083 --> 20:49.792
WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THIS?

20:50.833 --> 20:53.250
IT'S A BUSH
THAT GROWS MEAT!

20:53.333 --> 20:55.250
LET'S GET
SOME GRAVY!

20:55.333 --> 20:57.083
Different voice:
YEP. EVEN ME,

20:57.167 --> 20:58.625
AS DOUBLE-D
FINDS THIS

20:58.708 --> 21:00.125
REALLY
KIND OF LOGICAL.

21:00.208 --> 21:01.708
Eddy: YOU SAID IT,
DOUBLE-D!

21:01.792 --> 21:04.792
I JUST USED THIS MAGIC
MEAT-GROWING DIRT!

21:04.875 --> 21:07.417
I'LL TAKE EVERYTHING YOU GOT
FOR A TRADE, HUH?

21:07.500 --> 21:09.458
HA HA HA!
THIS FOOL THINKS

21:09.542 --> 21:12.750
ROLF AND BOY JIMMY
WILL FALL FOR
HIS SHENANIGANS?

21:12.833 --> 21:14.208
GOOFY GRAPE!

21:14.042 --> 21:15.250
MANURE BOY!

21:15.333 --> 21:16.583
Edd:
WELL, WELL, WELL.

21:16.667 --> 21:19.583
SEEMS ONE CAN'T TEND
TO THEIR NATURAL
FUNCTIONS

21:19.667 --> 21:21.125
WITHOUT
BEING REPLACED

21:21.208 --> 21:23.042
BY SOME RAGTAG
HAND PUPPET!

21:23.125 --> 21:24.625
Eddy: HOLD THIS.

21:24.708 --> 21:26.208
OH, DEAR. I FELL.

21:26.042 --> 21:28.042
GIVE ME BACK
MY STUFF!

21:28.125 --> 21:30.167
YOU JERKS
RIPPED ME OFF!

21:30.250 --> 21:32.208
ED BOY, PLEASE STOP.
I BEG OF YOU.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.792
YOU WILL WAKE NANA.
SILENCE, YES?

21:34.875 --> 21:35.917
THANK YOU.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.417
SILENCE?
I'LL GIVE YOU SILENCE!

21:38.500 --> 21:41.167
WHO'S THERE?
WHO'S THERE?

21:41.000 --> 21:43.458
WHO IS THERE?

21:43.542 --> 21:45.917
Rolf: ED, BOY, HAVE MERCY.
FORGIVE ROLF,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.583
AND ROLF WILL MAKE GOOD
BY GIVING YOU

21:48.667 --> 21:50.167
THE REAL MONEY TREE SEED.

21:50.250 --> 21:51.792
REAL MONEY TREE
SEED?

21:51.875 --> 21:53.167
OH, PLEASE.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
DO YOU REALLY
THINK EDDY WOULD
FALL FOR THAT OLD--

21:56.083 --> 21:58.000
Eddy: DEAL!

21:59.708 --> 22:02.708
I'M RICH!

22:02.792 --> 22:05.333
HA HA HA!

22:07.542 --> 22:10.167
AND IT'S MINE,
ALL MINE!

22:10.250 --> 22:11.208
HEE HEE HEE!

22:11.292 --> 22:15.458
EVEN I AM NOT
THAT DUMB,
DOUBLE-D.

22:15.542 --> 22:16.708
HA HA HA HA!

22:16.792 --> 22:21.250
AN IRIS-IN WOULD BE APPROPRIATE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

22:21.333 --> 22:24.000
THANK YOU.
