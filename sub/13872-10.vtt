00:04.070 --> 00:08.200
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce myself.

00:08.408 --> 00:10.433
I am Dr. Buttocks.

00:11.011 --> 00:14.503
Gentlemen, where are you?

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074

00:57.390 --> 00:59.915
<i>Okay, the final category is science.</i>

00:59.993 --> 01:03.588
<i>Which alkaline earth metal
has the chemical symbol Be?</i>

01:06.099 --> 01:07.259
Cool. This one's easy.

01:07.333 --> 01:10.393
- No kidding. Put down Backstreet Boys.
- Will you be quiet?

01:10.470 --> 01:12.597
Put down Backstreet Boys.
You're not writing it.

01:12.672 --> 01:15.937
- You're giving it away.
- Sit down. It's not the Backstreet Boys.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.341
I know, and don't you dare put that down.

01:18.411 --> 01:21.505
Be? Come on, it's Benmark.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.048
- No, it ain't.
- Yeah.

01:23.116 --> 01:24.105
Benmark?

01:24.184 --> 01:27.017
It's a sublevel country
underneath Denmark.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.480
Think you would have heard of it.

01:29.989 --> 01:31.217
Is that what you're writing?

01:31.291 --> 01:33.987
No, I'm putting down beryllium
because that's the answer.

01:34.060 --> 01:36.028
Yeah, that's the other one.

01:36.629 --> 01:40.087
Hey, Frylock, get another pitcher of beer.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.259
I will not. You're not old enough to drink.

01:42.335 --> 01:45.736
You don't know everything. If you did,
we wouldn't be losing right now.

01:45.805 --> 01:49.502
We wouldn't be losing if you didn't write
Backstreet Boys on half our answers.

01:49.576 --> 01:53.910
Look, my gut tells me Backstreet,
and that is where my brain lives...

01:53.980 --> 01:55.140
with my gut.

01:55.215 --> 01:58.514
They's roommates, but sometimes
they don't get along too well.

01:58.585 --> 02:01.611
They's always arguing about the bills,
the son of bills...

02:01.688 --> 02:03.849
Okay, shut up. That's enough. Here we go.

02:03.923 --> 02:07.188
<i>And the answer is,
as Wayne got it, beryllium.</i>

02:07.260 --> 02:09.420
Yes, I knew it. I totally nailed that one.

02:09.496 --> 02:12.988
- Then why didn't you say that?
- What are you saying? I wrote it down.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.864
- I changed it to the Backstreet Boys.
- What?

02:15.935 --> 02:18.699
I mean, you heard
the confidence in his voice.

02:18.771 --> 02:21.865
- He sounded like he'd been there.
- Been where, Shake?

02:22.575 --> 02:24.873
Okay, I changed it to Benmark.

02:24.944 --> 02:26.138
- What?
- You're a fool!

02:26.212 --> 02:28.578
But, look, it is a country. I'll find a map.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.548
<i>Our scores at the end of this round:</i>

02:30.617 --> 02:34.348
<i>In second place, with 25 points,
the Backstreet Boys.</i>

02:34.420 --> 02:37.583
- They're here? Where are they?
- That's what you named us.

02:37.657 --> 02:42.253
<i>And in first place, yet again,
with another perfect score of 60 points:</i>

02:42.328 --> 02:43.955
<i>Wayne "the Brain "McLaine.</i>

02:44.030 --> 02:46.897
Yes. Oh, God, yes.

02:46.966 --> 02:48.763
God, I hate that Wayne.

02:48.835 --> 02:52.066
No way you're ever getting sex
with a thing like that on your head.

02:52.138 --> 02:54.663
- What's up?
- Not like us, right, pal?

02:55.642 --> 02:59.373
<i>And our final question of the game
is in the sports category.</i>

02:59.445 --> 03:01.003
<i>Wayne is the master of sports.</i>

03:01.080 --> 03:02.809
Hell, I suck at sports.

03:02.882 --> 03:05.146
<i>But Wayne doesn't. For two points each...</i>

03:05.218 --> 03:09.882
<i>like it matters, name the last five
NCAA basketball champions.</i>

03:09.956 --> 03:13.119
Don't sweat it. We got this covered.
I read the Backstreet bio.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.788
A.J. likes ice skating
and Howie likes to Frisbee...

03:16.863 --> 03:19.559
<i>- What about Basketball Jones?
- They hate Basketball Jones.</i>

03:19.632 --> 03:22.032
I heard it on the radio.
It's funny, and it's the answer.

03:22.101 --> 03:23.534
You put it down. I'm out of here.

03:23.603 --> 03:28.336
No, you're not, because he does not know
how to write, and I completely refuse to.

03:28.408 --> 03:32.504
Just calm down, Frylock. It's over.
We lost again.

03:32.779 --> 03:37.273
Let it go, and accept the truth
that we is dumb. Dumb as hell.

03:37.350 --> 03:40.911
He's right for the most part.
We got us a superstar...

03:41.221 --> 03:45.351
and we got two albacores
that are just hanging around my neck.

03:45.425 --> 03:46.619
Albatrosses.

03:46.693 --> 03:50.891
Yeah, it's like the Rhyme of the Marinate
happening all over again.

03:50.964 --> 03:55.924
I am real tired of Wayne walking away
with 50 bar dollars every Tuesday night.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.697
I got it. We'll go kill Wayne.

03:58.771 --> 04:01.433
No, we're doing this legal. Follow me.

04:01.874 --> 04:05.071
Where are the chicks,
and why are you clipping my eyes open?

04:05.144 --> 04:09.604
- Look, just watch the screen, okay?
- All right. Porno. Hey, I can deal.

04:09.682 --> 04:12.207
Actually, no.
It's all the world's knowledge...

04:12.285 --> 04:15.846
compressed into one humongous DVD.

04:16.122 --> 04:17.714
Does it show girls in the nude?

04:17.790 --> 04:21.226
It shows a woman without skin,
but that's really more about her organs.

04:21.293 --> 04:24.923
But the sex organs, right?
This is a good one.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.659
- See you Tuesday.
- He left.

04:26.733 --> 04:31.193
Yeah, I saw, 'cause I can't close my eyes
to not see.

04:35.541 --> 04:39.238
<i>Sounds like neither of those fools
don't gizzit to fizzit, baby.</i>

04:39.679 --> 04:41.510
- All right, how are we doing?
- Fine.

04:41.581 --> 04:45.950
No, we're not doing that.
My eyes are thirsty as hell here.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.316
Who do you think you are?

04:47.387 --> 04:51.323
I'm the only U.S. president to serve two
nonconsecutive terms in the Oval Office.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.951
Well, then, that would make you
Grover Cleveland.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.961
Why is this coming out of my mouth?

04:56.029 --> 04:59.556
Meatwad, how many nonconsecutive
terms did Grover Cleveland serve?

04:59.632 --> 05:02.760
I'm fine. Every day is fine like wine.

05:02.835 --> 05:04.598
Why don't we just unhook you?

05:04.671 --> 05:07.902
Wait a minute. He's not going anywhere
that I haven't been.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.965
I'll go anywhere I want, boy.

05:10.677 --> 05:14.010
Come on, damn it.
I got this thing embedded in my ass.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.672
Oh, shoot. I'm sorry about that.

05:15.748 --> 05:18.546
What is it?
Looks like a Ethiopian toilet seat.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.313
It's just a basketball hoop.

05:20.386 --> 05:23.219
What is this "basketball" you speak of?

05:23.289 --> 05:26.486
Hell, I forgot to put sports on the DVD.

05:27.226 --> 05:30.457
And what is this "sports" you speak of?

05:30.630 --> 05:32.393
Carl, my man, what's up?

05:32.465 --> 05:34.365
I don't have any food, so get lost.

05:34.434 --> 05:37.870
Dinner is on us tonight, 'cause you know
what tonight is, don't you?

05:37.937 --> 05:41.930
Oh, yeah. Tonight I'm downloading porn
at 14 kilobytes a second.

05:43.076 --> 05:46.375
I'm just kidding.
I got a cable modem back here.

05:46.446 --> 05:49.609
We were hoping you'd want to come
to a party with us tonight.

05:49.682 --> 05:53.413
Looks like they're done partying.
Now what they're doing is loitering...

05:53.486 --> 05:54.919
and that's very illegal.

05:54.987 --> 05:57.387
Here's the deal.
We're playing Team Trivia tonight.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.049
We need someone that knows sports.

05:59.125 --> 06:02.253
Here's a trivia question:
Why would I want to do that?

06:02.328 --> 06:05.092
Yeah, the chicks. Where are they, Fryman?

06:05.164 --> 06:09.066
They're in the back moistening
their T-shirts for the Jell-O wrestling.

06:09.669 --> 06:13.571
Now you're speaking my language here.
I knew you wasn't gay.

06:13.639 --> 06:16.631
Is that why you're not sitting
with the rest of the team, Carl?

06:16.709 --> 06:19.337
What are you, kidding?
No, I'm not doing that.

06:19.412 --> 06:22.438
There's a broad right there. Hey!

06:22.515 --> 06:27.350
Yeah, you, dingbat.
I want a pitcher of beer, fried jalapeÃ±os...

06:27.420 --> 06:31.083
the Nachos Grande,
and let's start with 50 wings, extra-hot...

06:31.157 --> 06:32.647
and keep the ranch coming.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.583
Two coffees, please.

06:34.727 --> 06:38.390
You know what I ordered?
I'm gonna be farting blood over here.

06:38.464 --> 06:41.865
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
turn around and face your trivia doom.</i>

06:41.934 --> 06:44.801
<i>It's Wayne "the Brain "McLaine.</i>

06:44.871 --> 06:48.102
You're going down tonight, Wayne.
Carl, we need to name our team.

06:48.174 --> 06:51.075
- Something tough.
- I turned it in, Fryman. We're good.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.408
<i>And our other competing squad:</i>

06:53.746 --> 06:57.113
<i>the One-Eyed Wonder Weasels
and their Two Balls.</i>

06:57.183 --> 06:58.207
Two balls.

06:58.284 --> 07:00.013
<i>Very clever, guys. Thanks.</i>

07:00.086 --> 07:03.522
You get where I'm going with that,
Fryman? You understand the thing?

07:03.589 --> 07:05.784
- The joke?
- Yeah, I do, Carl.

07:05.858 --> 07:06.882
Tonight.

07:07.226 --> 07:08.693
The Rosetta Stone.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.888
<i>And the answer is the Rosetta Stone.</i>

07:10.963 --> 07:13.329
Yeah, Fryman in the house, baby.

07:13.399 --> 07:16.596
<i>I want to say Raw Deal,
but it seems like it could be Commando.</i>

07:16.669 --> 07:17.658
<i>The Running Man.</i>

07:17.737 --> 07:20.467
<i>One of Arnold's first big hits,
it was The Running Man.</i>

07:20.540 --> 07:22.303
<i>Remember Richard Dawson in that one.</i>

07:22.375 --> 07:24.673
-1060...
-1060 what?

07:24.744 --> 07:26.405
<i>- Six!
-1066.</i>

07:26.479 --> 07:27.878
Boo-yaaka!

07:27.947 --> 07:29.244
Joseph of Arimathea.

07:29.315 --> 07:32.648
<i>And the answer was Joseph of Arimathea,
and the scores are still tied.</i>

07:32.718 --> 07:34.583
Yes. High fry, Carl.

07:38.090 --> 07:41.184
- How's that spelled?
- L-E-S-B-I-A-N.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.956
Shut up, you're spelling "lesbian".

07:45.097 --> 07:46.587
He said "lesbian".

07:46.666 --> 07:48.930
<i>And at the end of regulation,
we have a barnburner.</i>

07:49.001 --> 07:51.060
<i>Tied for the lead, with a perfect score:</i>

07:51.137 --> 07:54.800
<i>Wayne "the Brain "and the One-Eyed guys.</i>

07:54.874 --> 07:56.865
He didn't say it all. You got to say it all.

07:56.943 --> 07:59.434
Say the "two balls" part.
You don't get it without that.

07:59.512 --> 08:03.414
<i>Final question. The category is
hydromagnetic magnetoidal dimensions.</i>

08:03.483 --> 08:05.644
- Hydro what?
- What happened? Did we win?

08:05.718 --> 08:08.482
<i>For 10 points:
When traveling at a subsonic speed...</i>

08:08.554 --> 08:12.217
<i>during the last one hour of hypersleep,
which vector of the Romulan Nebula...</i>

08:12.291 --> 08:14.885
<i>will suffer the wrath
of the impenetrable quickening?</i>

08:14.961 --> 08:18.158
<i>And for extra points:
How many rads to the nearest multon?</i>

08:18.231 --> 08:20.324
<i>Be specific. This is a real question.</i>

08:20.399 --> 08:21.696
Hell.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.826
- This is so easy.
- Carl?

08:23.903 --> 08:27.168
I said 50 more wings.
What are you, dumb?

08:27.240 --> 08:29.572
- Shake, wake up.
- Finally...

08:33.246 --> 08:34.270
Damn it, he's fried.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.544
That's okay,
because I happen to know the answer.

08:37.616 --> 08:40.780
All right, fine. Go ahead, say it.
Say "the Backstreet Boys".

08:40.852 --> 08:43.048
I know. That's what I thought at first, too.

08:43.121 --> 08:45.989
But if you think back
to the time you took me to the lake...

08:46.058 --> 08:50.495
and taught me how to go fishing, you'd
realize that has nothing to do with this.

08:50.930 --> 08:53.091
The answer is 'NSync.

08:53.165 --> 08:56.032
Of course it is. Go on, turn it in.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.501
- Stay cool.
- I know.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.834
So, when we doing the sports part here?

08:59.906 --> 09:03.672
We're not. We didn't. It's over. We lost.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.233
Did your ass get enough wings?

09:05.311 --> 09:07.609
You tell me.
Does this look like I got enough?

09:07.680 --> 09:10.205
Carl, give me your celery.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.875
No, I need it for fiber.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.752
I have problems.

09:13.986 --> 09:16.955
<i>Okay, we have a winner for 50 bar dollars.</i>

09:17.023 --> 09:20.720
<i>And once again the title of champion,
Wayne "the Main Brain "McLaine.</i>

09:20.793 --> 09:21.919
Yes. Success.

09:21.994 --> 09:23.723
So now it's "the Main Brain"?

09:23.796 --> 09:25.661
You think you're so much better
than we are?

09:25.731 --> 09:29.189
Because I am. I won.
I'm perfect in all ways.

09:29.268 --> 09:32.328
Yep, except for that Afro.
Plus, you got bad zits, boy.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.635
- I got those on purpose.
- You need a Buf-Puf.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.800
Come on, we're never coming back
to this bar.

09:36.876 --> 09:40.243
Wait. You will wait,
and you will hang out with Wayne.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.714
Wayne does have bar dollars.

09:42.782 --> 09:46.548
- Look, just answer me this one question.
- Yeah, what's wrong with your hair?

09:46.619 --> 09:49.019
Well, that really wasn't the question.

09:49.088 --> 09:52.489
- So it is grass. I'm eating it.
- Damn, is that all brain?

09:52.558 --> 09:55.425
It's the biggest one you've ever seen.
Go ahead.

09:55.494 --> 09:57.792
Ask forth your question
to the all-knowing Wayne...

09:57.863 --> 10:00.730
and Wayne shall deliver unto you
the answer of correctitude...

10:00.800 --> 10:03.166
regardless of your limited ability
to comprehend it.

10:03.235 --> 10:05.829
Okay. What did you put
for the final question?

10:05.905 --> 10:07.998
The Backstreet Boys.

10:08.074 --> 10:09.336
Was what?

10:10.409 --> 10:12.639
Your hair is good to eat.

10:13.512 --> 10:17.073
All the questions are merely illusions
created by Wayne.

10:17.149 --> 10:20.607
Just like this booth,
Ned Hastings, our host...

10:20.686 --> 10:23.655
and the hot, moist meat
on your friend's wings.

10:23.723 --> 10:26.351
- So that's why he never gets full.
- He's a glutton.

10:26.425 --> 10:28.916
That bill is very real.
You need to pay me right now.

10:28.995 --> 10:30.758
Man, what is your problem?

10:30.830 --> 10:33.458
People are jealous of my ability
to put them down.

10:33.966 --> 10:38.596
It brings me great joy, but no tail,
if you understand the vernacular.

10:38.671 --> 10:40.798
We all have our problems with women...

10:40.873 --> 10:44.536
but we don't just create some fake
situation to try and attract girls.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.100
Because you can't.

10:46.178 --> 10:49.306
- Don't rub it in, okay? We know.
- That's all you know.

10:49.382 --> 10:53.216
Why don't you make yourself a girlfriend
