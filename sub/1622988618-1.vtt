WEBVTT

00:04.295 --> 00:06.506
(ominous music)

00:29.112 --> 00:31.823
- Is any of this even necessary?

00:32.448 --> 00:34.951
That dipshit'll
be dead before me.

00:35.452 --> 00:36.286
- Him again?

00:37.620 --> 00:38.621
- Fine.

00:39.039 --> 00:43.293
The date is February 23rd, 1982.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.462
- Can I get some snacks in here?

00:46.212 --> 00:50.216
- Son, 18 years and nine
months ago you were conceived

00:50.216 --> 00:52.635
on the Gadbury Ice

00:52.635 --> 00:56.139
and you've been the bane
of my existence ever since.

00:57.348 --> 01:00.560
When I was alive, I
lay awake at night

01:00.560 --> 01:05.482
wishing I had pulled out and
let you melt into the ice.

01:05.982 --> 01:09.652
As the saying goes,
spilled semen.

01:09.652 --> 01:12.822
You've enjoyed the finer
aspects of the Gadbury name

01:12.822 --> 01:15.825
while never fulfilling
your family duties.

01:16.826 --> 01:20.163
Our legacy as curling
elite goes back centuries

01:20.163 --> 01:23.166
and now I'm afraid
that will die.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.502
As my final farewell to you,

01:25.502 --> 01:28.505
I'll give you one
last opportunity

01:28.505 --> 01:30.548
to prove you are a Gadbury.

01:31.674 --> 01:33.843
And if not, your
sweet half baby sister

01:33.843 --> 01:37.013
will receive my whole fortune.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.848
Maybe by the time you've
seen this, you will have-

01:41.392 --> 01:44.896
I've been saving this,
my little caliente.

01:45.854 --> 01:47.190
- [Father] Whoa.

01:48.024 --> 01:50.193
- Rapido papi.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.737
(grunting)
(sexy music)

02:20.932 --> 02:21.224
- Yes.

02:23.726 --> 02:26.271
(upbeat music)

03:02.015 --> 03:03.933
(victorious music)

03:08.438 --> 03:12.108
- Come on, come on, come
on, come on, push yourself.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.444
(victorious music)

03:14.444 --> 03:15.612
Push yourself!

03:16.946 --> 03:18.865
(victorious music)

03:19.199 --> 03:20.617
I want to see them titties

03:20.617 --> 03:23.620
bouncing from your toenails
to your temples, tubby.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.623
(victorious music)

03:31.127 --> 03:32.962
Why you stop, man?

03:33.213 --> 03:34.380
- What?

03:34.380 --> 03:36.174
Come on man, it's hot.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.300
- Hot?

03:37.466 --> 03:39.802
Man, check the ladder.

03:39.802 --> 03:40.637
Dang.

03:41.971 --> 03:44.057
(victorious music)

04:17.214 --> 04:18.257
Fuck is he doing?

04:20.718 --> 04:22.220
What is you doing?

04:23.554 --> 04:25.014
- I prefer baseball.

04:25.014 --> 04:26.683
(sighs)

04:27.016 --> 04:28.059
- Lunch porky.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.227
And you!

04:32.689 --> 04:35.942
Whatever it is you
selling, I ain't buying.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.694
- I ain't selling, I'm serving.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.362
- What the fuck is this?

04:39.362 --> 04:41.572
This bitch open my mail.

04:41.572 --> 04:44.200
- Pay your house
payment, you broke bitch.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.870
- What is this?

04:51.207 --> 04:53.293
- But I will get away with it.

04:53.293 --> 04:57.714
My brain is a catalog of
Datelines and 48 Hour Mysteries.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.550
(speaking in foreign language)

05:00.550 --> 05:03.469
That's right bitch,
I'm drowning you.

05:03.469 --> 05:07.098
That's my money, my inheritance,
every single penny of it.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.725
You little bastard.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.728
That's my money, you're
not getting any of it.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.271
- Drowning me again, puto?

05:15.982 --> 05:17.900
- Did you know about the tape?

05:20.153 --> 05:22.238
Why didn't you tell me?

05:22.238 --> 05:23.740
(speaking in foreign language)

05:23.740 --> 05:25.742
- Because you're a piece of
shit that only took from dad.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.452
He didn't want you
to have that money.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.745
You don't even deserve it.

05:28.745 --> 05:29.996
- That's not true.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.623
I'm the true heir to
the Gadbury throne.

05:32.623 --> 05:35.752
- You never even went on
the ice to throw with us.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.253
Do you even curl?

05:37.253 --> 05:39.255
- It's in my blood.

05:39.255 --> 05:42.342
- Okay, so when's the last
time you went on the ice?

05:44.344 --> 05:46.137
Exactly, I thought so.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.264
You were too busy
fucking your mattress

05:48.264 --> 05:49.766
and eating your damn Twinkies

05:49.766 --> 05:51.517
to be part of the
family business.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.644
- That's not true.

05:53.644 --> 05:55.104
It's all mine.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.523
- Listen up dipshit,

05:58.274 --> 06:00.693
the lawyer is here and needs
you to sign some papers

06:00.693 --> 06:03.112
so you're aware of
the terms, okay?

06:03.112 --> 06:04.280
So you're gonna get ready,

06:04.280 --> 06:05.448
you're gonna meet
me in the office

06:05.448 --> 06:07.450
'cause Brett is waiting for us.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.535
(yelling)

06:10.119 --> 06:12.789
(ominous music)

06:14.123 --> 06:14.999
(speaking in foreign language)

06:14.999 --> 06:17.126
What's taking him so long?

06:17.126 --> 06:18.628
- He's gonna be here,
don't worry about it.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.004
- Look at him.

06:23.549 --> 06:24.967
- What?

06:24.967 --> 06:26.803
You know I have low blood sugar?

06:26.803 --> 06:29.806
- Gordon, shut up
and sign the papers.

06:29.806 --> 06:30.973
- Gordon.

06:34.685 --> 06:36.979
I'm here to explain the
conditions of the trust.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.357
Your father left
explicit instructions

06:39.357 --> 06:40.525
that upon his death

06:40.525 --> 06:42.860
the only way to receive
your inheritance,

06:45.321 --> 06:50.743
which is valued
at $125.8 million,

06:51.202 --> 06:52.495
is if you lead a curling team

06:52.495 --> 06:53.830
to the regionals of
the Olympic trials.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.164
That is the good news.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.334
- Then what's the bad?

07:01.170 --> 07:03.005
- The bad is the qualifiers
for the regionals

07:03.005 --> 07:04.424
its in one month.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.258
- What?

07:06.509 --> 07:08.678
- Looks like you
better get going.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.264
(tense music)

07:24.610 --> 07:27.363
- How in the world am I gonna
put together a team this fast?

07:28.239 --> 07:31.075
- Gordon, I can be of
service if you need.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.869
- How's a blow job gonna help me

07:32.869 --> 07:34.954
put together an all
area curling team?

07:38.416 --> 07:39.250
Couldn't hurt.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.295
- I meant with teammates.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.881
I happen to know a couple of
unemployed curlers in the area

07:44.881 --> 07:47.216
who'd be available
for the right price.

07:47.425 --> 07:48.885
- Money is no object.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.094
- Done.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.554
I'll get in touch
with you, okay?

07:51.554 --> 07:52.889
- Thank you.
- No problem.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.234
- Fat boy, this is $45.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.777
- With the promise of a million.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.070
- How?

08:08.070 --> 08:09.739
- All we have to do is
get to the regionals,

08:09.739 --> 08:12.325
expose my sister
for the fraud she is

08:12.325 --> 08:14.785
and the $125 million is mine.

08:14.785 --> 08:15.995
- That shit is a month away.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.747
- We better get to it then.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.582
- Get yo ass out my house.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.919
The bee don't get out
the bed for less than,

08:22.919 --> 08:25.338
let's think $1,500.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.091
- Tell you what?

08:32.094 --> 08:32.929
$1,000 a week.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.429
- Cash only tubby.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.847
- I'll get you your money.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.308
(women yelling)

08:38.768 --> 08:40.102
Who is that?

08:41.102 --> 08:42.772
- Oh that's Gerri Redding.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.273
- Let me be.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.442
Get off me, get off me.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.110
Get off me.

08:48.110 --> 08:49.779
- Gerri Redding,

08:49.779 --> 08:51.531
the first female
drafted to the NFL.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.033
- NFL?

08:54.033 --> 08:56.327
- Professional football, man.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.621
- We didn't watch the
sports of the commoners.

08:58.621 --> 09:02.625
- Well, right after she was
drafted, she went crazy,

09:02.625 --> 09:04.794
drugs, hookers.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.712
She didn't even
get to play a game.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.465
- Where can I find her?

09:11.300 --> 09:12.385
- County fool.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.472
(mysterious music)

09:28.317 --> 09:29.652
- Are you the one
that bailed me out?

09:29.652 --> 09:30.820
- Yes.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.655
- Listen, I
appreciate it and all,

09:32.655 --> 09:34.407
but I don't get down like that.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.241
- I'm sorry?

09:35.741 --> 09:37.660
- With dicks, your dick.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.328
I'm not gonna suck
it or nothing.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.163
This is a no dick zone,

09:41.163 --> 09:44.750
not here, not here,
not here, not nowhere.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.670
- No, if I wanted a blowjob

09:47.670 --> 09:49.088
I'd get a much
better looking guy.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.090
This is strictly professional.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.091
Have you ever thought

09:52.091 --> 09:54.844
about playing a true
professional sport?

09:54.844 --> 09:57.513
- Man I ain't got time
for the bullshit today.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.515
- Listen, I'm giving
you the opportunity

09:59.515 --> 10:01.851
to elevate your physical prowess

10:02.101 --> 10:06.856
to play a sport of
the gods, curling.

10:07.064 --> 10:09.358
- Man, let me get
out of this bitch.

10:09.734 --> 10:10.568
I'm out.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.864
(upbeat music)

10:16.032 --> 10:18.409
- Oh that looks
like a good site.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.121
Wow, she's pretty.

10:22.538 --> 10:25.207
(upbeat music)

10:31.380 --> 10:33.090
She sweeps like an angel.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.430
Hello Amor.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.977
I have a proposito for you.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.605
(upbeat music)

11:16.509 --> 11:16.926
Pop!

11:18.636 --> 11:19.428
Pop!

11:19.929 --> 11:20.763
Pop!

11:23.432 --> 11:26.936
- Geraldine, why you sneak
in my house like that?

11:26.936 --> 11:28.437
- I been calling your name.

11:28.437 --> 11:30.106
- I'm trying to get
a little shut eye

11:30.272 --> 11:32.024
for my studio session tonight.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.194
What's wrong, baby girl?

11:35.945 --> 11:37.113
(sighs)

11:37.613 --> 11:38.614
- I need your help.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.617
You know the training ain't
going like as planned.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.953
- You mean them fucked
up tires in the yard?

11:44.036 --> 11:45.496
No shit.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.998
- They about to take the house.

11:48.124 --> 11:51.794
- You had it all,
first woman in the NFL

11:51.794 --> 11:54.630
and you had to fuck it up

11:54.630 --> 11:57.800
with them phat asses and blunts.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.344
- I ain't come here to get a
lecture from black country.

12:00.344 --> 12:01.971
- Yeah, I'm singing
country music.

12:02.138 --> 12:05.641
I'm 'bout to change
the game, just like-

12:05.641 --> 12:06.684
- Ray Charles?

12:07.518 --> 12:09.311
You ain't no Ray Charles.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.563
- Damn right.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.899
He's six feet under
and I'm still standing.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.651
I would love to help you

12:16.485 --> 12:19.655
but I got all my money tied
in the video shoot next month.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.699
I spent my life on your dreams.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.076
Now I got to do mine, Geraldine.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.870
Now just listen to my new song.

12:26.495 --> 12:30.166
♪ Come on home little
darling I love ♪

12:33.252 --> 12:36.338
Damn Geraldine, I was just
getting to the good part.

12:36.338 --> 12:37.757
- Man, I'll listen later.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.383
- As soon as this gets sold,

12:39.383 --> 12:42.052
we gonna be back on
top, I'm telling you.

12:42.344 --> 12:43.512
- Man whatever.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.727
(upbeat music)

13:01.947 --> 13:02.740
- What the?

13:03.532 --> 13:04.617
Hell no.

13:04.950 --> 13:08.245
(speaking in foreign language)

13:08.537 --> 13:09.789
- Who you calling limp?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.041
Your mama.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.251
(speaking in foreign language)

13:14.251 --> 13:17.213
- Yo, yo, shut the fuck up.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.130
- You made it!

13:18.130 --> 13:19.465
- Yeah, I made it, we good.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.050
That direct deposit
went through.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.470
Gordo, what the fuck?

13:26.388 --> 13:27.306
This is wood.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.267
(speaking in foreign language)

13:30.810 --> 13:32.978
- Gordo is a bit
harsh, don't you think?

13:32.978 --> 13:36.106
(speaking in foreign language)

13:36.649 --> 13:38.818
- Why are we practicing wood?

13:38.943 --> 13:41.111
- It's an old Gadbury secret.

13:41.237 --> 13:44.281
If you can practice on
wood, the ice is a breeze.

13:45.574 --> 13:47.576
- That's the stupidest
shit I ever heard.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.410
I'm out.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.417
- I guess you could send
that money back then, huh?

14:00.756 --> 14:03.092
It's not just about
hitting the bullseye.

14:03.425 --> 14:06.095
It's about keeping the other
team out of here as well.

14:07.513 --> 14:10.599
- Fat boy, I'm the black
curling world champion.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.142
Give me the God damn broom.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.645
- Well who's gonna
throw the stone?

14:16.939 --> 14:19.608
(speaking in foreign language)

14:22.528 --> 14:24.989
- You better float
your ass down the wood.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.991
(sighs)

14:29.535 --> 14:31.370
(speaking in foreign language)

14:31.787 --> 14:33.122
- I don't know.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.790
Let me take care of him though.

14:37.668 --> 14:40.462
Gordo, I'll throw
the stones for now

14:40.963 --> 14:43.841
but we need to find
somebody ASAP, cool?

14:45.551 --> 14:47.678
I got some cookies in
the back for you too.

14:47.803 --> 14:49.638
Come on, pep up, Gordo.

14:49.638 --> 14:52.641
(mysterious music)

14:59.815 --> 15:04.737
(crowd applauding)
(dramatic music)

15:36.101 --> 15:38.020
(upbeat music)

16:41.083 --> 16:42.292
- Who are these people?

16:43.127 --> 16:45.004
- Well you know
the beached whale

16:45.170 --> 16:48.090
and that half naked gentlemen
got suspended for three years

16:48.090 --> 16:49.591
for selling trades
to the Canadians.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.428
And well that, that's the help.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.346
(clapping)

16:54.346 --> 16:56.098
Well done, tons of fun.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.142
Looks like you're
just one practice away

16:58.142 --> 17:00.102
from world domination.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.813
- Eat a shit sandwich,
Smellsmerelda.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.982
- Oh, touchy big brother,

17:04.982 --> 17:06.858
being poor is keeping
you up at night?

17:07.483 --> 17:09.778
- Hey Gordon, sorry
to disturb practice.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.989
- Why do you even hang
out with my sister, Brett?

17:12.448 --> 17:15.951
- Well I, I work for her.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.287
- They used to call
her a gang banger

17:18.287 --> 17:20.164
and not 'cause she reps a set.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.540
- Can we get on with it?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.292
- As part of the agreement,

17:24.292 --> 17:27.671
you are to cease and desist
all use of family funds.

17:27.671 --> 17:28.630
- What?

17:29.298 --> 17:32.342
- Oh, you haven't told
your little butt buddies

17:32.342 --> 17:33.969
that you're poor?

17:34.553 --> 17:35.387
(speaking in foreign language)

17:35.679 --> 17:40.225
The man is poor meaning
zippo, zero, nada.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.478
I will circumcise you again.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.813
- Do you understand
these conditions?

17:48.650 --> 17:49.985
- Yes.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.361
- Okay, can we go now?

17:52.321 --> 17:54.656
(dark music)

18:01.538 --> 18:02.539
No

18:02.915 --> 18:04.416
I can't stand him.

18:11.381 --> 18:12.549
Nice pooch.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.093
- Don't let this
outfit fool you.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.178
I'll snatch your
life, rich bitch.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.931
(dark music)

18:24.520 --> 18:25.854
- That was awesome.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.731
- Man, let's hurry up and
get this show on the road.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.775
Your girl baking
bread down here.

18:30.734 --> 18:33.112
(dark music)

18:34.530 --> 18:37.282
- Make sure that linebacker
bitch doesn't get in my way.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.410
- I know she played a little
linebacker in high school.

18:40.410 --> 18:43.205
(speaking in foreign language)

19:05.435 --> 19:06.395
- How are you?

19:07.062 --> 19:08.397
- I'm doing well, thank you.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.941
- I was just looking
over these plans

19:11.984 --> 19:15.946
and we're soon gonna have
the premier curling facility

19:15.946 --> 19:19.908
in the world right
here in South Florida.

19:20.242 --> 19:23.579
And it's all thanks
to your beautiful,

19:23.787 --> 19:27.249
generous $100 million donation.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.918
- Commissioner Pottinger,
you are too kind.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.088
I would be remiss if I
didn't give all that I have

19:33.088 --> 19:34.798
to the curling community here

19:34.798 --> 19:37.009
after all it's
done for my family.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.596
- Well, I can't
thank you enough.

19:52.107 --> 19:52.983
- What am I 'posed to do?

19:53.442 --> 19:55.110
- I love your enthusiasm.

19:55.527 --> 19:56.778
Everything you need to know

19:56.778 --> 19:58.363
is right here in this
instructional video.

20:06.455 --> 20:09.041
(upbeat music)

20:16.798 --> 20:18.300
- That's some bullshit.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.511
- Come on, let's
go, you got this.

20:23.388 --> 20:26.058
(upbeat music)

20:29.353 --> 20:32.231
All right, there you
go, remember your form.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.360
(upbeat music)

20:52.334 --> 20:53.835
(grunting)

21:06.682 --> 21:08.392
(upbeat music)

21:09.685 --> 21:11.853
(grunting)

21:13.355 --> 21:15.941
(upbeat music)

21:34.251 --> 21:37.129
(speaking in foreign language)

21:39.381 --> 21:40.424
- Gerri, you got a minute?

21:41.258 --> 21:42.092
- What?

21:42.092 --> 21:43.302
- Look, I know practice

21:43.302 --> 21:44.886
didn't go as well as
you would've liked but-

21:45.262 --> 21:46.138
- But nothing.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.390
We suck. I suck.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.934
- If you want, we can stay late
and I'll help you practice.

21:51.226 --> 21:53.478
- Nah man, I got to
find a job, Gordo.

21:53.895 --> 21:55.397
Man, I got problems.

21:55.605 --> 21:56.898
This is fine and all,

21:56.898 --> 21:59.109
but if I don't
work, I don't eat.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.240
- Look, I know this isn't much-

22:05.407 --> 22:07.826
- No man, no, I can't.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.578
- Listen, if we're
gonna win this thing,

22:09.745 --> 22:11.621
I need you here and here.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.251
- Are you sure?

22:16.251 --> 22:18.920
- If it'll keep you focused
and off the streets then...

22:24.801 --> 22:27.429
(upbeat music)

22:48.533 --> 22:52.287
- Have you ever felt like
magnetically involved

22:52.287 --> 22:53.288
with another?

22:57.167 --> 22:58.293
Exactly.

23:05.801 --> 23:09.388
Are you gonna tip me
for a dance or what?

23:11.056 --> 23:12.474
- Did you even dance?

23:12.808 --> 23:15.644
- Yeah, five or six dances ago.

23:15.894 --> 23:18.480
Look, I'm gonna
be up there soon.

23:18.814 --> 23:21.316
Just give me a few dollars

23:21.316 --> 23:24.569
and I'll just consider
it down payment.

23:25.487 --> 23:26.530
- Hell no.

23:36.998 --> 23:39.334
- You're not gonna
invite me for a drink?

23:40.710 --> 23:41.837
- No.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.674
(speaking in foreign language)

23:46.425 --> 23:48.927
- I've been cooling over
here by myself vibing.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.721
Get the fuck out my booth.

23:52.722 --> 23:55.517
- Okay, okay, leaving.

23:59.688 --> 24:00.439
(slurping)

24:00.522 --> 24:02.190
- Bitch, what the
fuck is you doing?

24:02.190 --> 24:03.066
(coughing)

24:03.191 --> 24:05.026
- Excuse me, you
got a problem here?

24:05.026 --> 24:05.861
- She offered me a drink

24:05.861 --> 24:07.028
and then she got crazy.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.072
- Man, she drank
out of my bottle.

24:09.364 --> 24:11.199
- You can't be
threatening the dancers.

24:11.199 --> 24:12.367
- Man.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.871
(grunting)

24:29.050 --> 24:29.634
I just-

24:29.634 --> 24:30.927
- What the fuck was that?

24:31.303 --> 24:32.971
I already bailed you out once

24:32.971 --> 24:34.306
and now I got to
bail you out again

24:34.306 --> 24:35.724
'cause you punched a
stripper in the face?

24:35.807 --> 24:37.559
- First off, I
aint punch nobody.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.060
- Look, it doesn't even matter.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.312
We don't have to be friends.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.147
We don't even have
to like each other.

24:42.272 --> 24:44.441
Once we win the regionals,
you're off the hook,

24:44.733 --> 24:47.110
but I'm not bailing
you out again.

24:57.787 --> 24:59.581
You call yourself an athlete?

25:01.291 --> 25:02.167
- What you say?

25:02.584 --> 25:04.085
- We're a week away
from this match

25:04.085 --> 25:05.587
and you're still sweeping
like a light skin.

25:08.256 --> 25:10.342
- Can you even wrap
those thick ass fingers

25:10.342 --> 25:11.968
around a broom and sweep?

25:11.968 --> 25:14.429
- I'll wrap my hands
around your peanut head you

25:17.265 --> 25:19.768
(speaking in foreign language)

25:26.650 --> 25:28.610
- Y'all break that shit up.

25:28.860 --> 25:29.945
- This the most hood shit

25:29.945 --> 25:30.946
I ever been a part of.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.615
You thought you was gonna
teach this how to throw.

25:33.615 --> 25:34.783
- What that posed to mean?

25:34.783 --> 25:38.203
- It's cool, you made
the league barely.

25:38.787 --> 25:39.871
To be a curler,

25:41.289 --> 25:42.165
you need heart

25:43.208 --> 25:45.126
and the whole world know
you don't have that.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.171
(grunting)

25:48.797 --> 25:50.131
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.

25:53.635 --> 25:54.970
- Gerri, no, Gerri come on.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.805
I need him, I need you both.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.683
Gerri, I need you both.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.811
[shouting]

26:02.978 --> 26:04.854
For the love of
the broom!

26:06.231 --> 26:07.649
- Get up off me, sasquatch.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.359
I'm out of here, Gordo.

26:09.484 --> 26:11.194
I'mma go home, get
my dick sucked,

26:11.486 --> 26:14.698
eat some cereal, get a
manicure and count some money.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.366
Teach these scrubs how to throw.

26:16.491 --> 26:17.826
- And make sure you grow,

26:17.826 --> 26:19.369
short ass bitch.
- Fuck you.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.038
- Man, I'm outta
here, I'm tired.

26:34.509 --> 26:37.053
- Gordon, good to see you.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.263
- [Gordon] You too.

26:39.055 --> 26:41.433
- Your sister was just
telling me about the

26:41.433 --> 26:44.019
eclectic team that
you've assembled.

26:44.227 --> 26:45.729
- Fucking trash.

26:45.729 --> 26:48.273
- I'm trying out a
new type of athlete

26:48.273 --> 26:49.232
for this year's games.

26:49.232 --> 26:50.692
- That team of yours

26:50.692 --> 26:54.070
is only going to bring down our
family name with that hooker

26:54.070 --> 26:57.365
and that manimal you have.

26:57.365 --> 26:58.533
- Eat shit.

26:58.533 --> 26:59.701
- Hey Gordon.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.870
- She is a bastard.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.872
My old man was
banging the maid when-

27:03.872 --> 27:04.873
(speaking in foreign language)

27:05.290 --> 27:06.041
- Really?

27:08.376 --> 27:11.254
- Well, I guess I have
to thank you as well

27:11.254 --> 27:12.589
for the generous donation.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.716
- No, no, no, no
need to thank him.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.217
He's done nothing.

27:16.426 --> 27:19.304
- I took a shit in your
bathroom, no flush.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.056
It was Taco Tuesday.

27:22.223 --> 27:23.058
- Gordon.

27:27.062 --> 27:30.315
Well, if that's everything,
I've got to get back to work.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.484
So we'll be seeing
you at the regionals.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.402
- Thank you commissioner.
- Thank you commissioner.

27:34.569 --> 27:35.570
- Gordon.

27:35.570 --> 27:36.780
- Thank you.

27:37.238 --> 27:40.241
- Wait, you did wash
your hands, right?

27:41.743 --> 27:44.746
(mysterious music)

27:51.753 --> 27:53.171
- Get a good night's rest.

27:53.171 --> 27:55.632
You're gonna need all your
strength for tomorrow's match.

27:55.965 --> 27:57.175
- Yeah, whatever.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.510
- Can I give you
a ride somewhere?

28:03.682 --> 28:05.767
♪ So come on home,
little darling ♪

28:05.767 --> 28:07.644
♪ I love you

28:07.936 --> 28:11.106
♪ I didn't mean
to make you cry ♪

28:11.314 --> 28:15.318
♪ I know I drink and gamble
and run around town ♪

28:15.443 --> 28:19.531
♪ But my little darling,
I'm gonna settle down ♪

28:23.618 --> 28:25.453
Glad you could
make it, Geraldine.

28:25.870 --> 28:26.705
- What's good, pops?

28:26.705 --> 28:27.622
How's it going?

28:27.789 --> 28:29.165
- 'Bout finished up now.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.834
On the last scene.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.794
This is my partner, Anna.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.003
- Hi I'm Coach Gordon.

28:34.379 --> 28:38.800
- God damn, you mighty
piggly mother fucker.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.969
- Well it takes one to know one.

28:41.136 --> 28:43.471
(laughing)

28:46.307 --> 28:47.726
- Thanks for giving baby girl

28:47.726 --> 28:48.727
another shot at the big game.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.812
- You coming out
for the big match?

28:50.854 --> 28:53.148
- Never missed any of her
games, not gonna start now.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.649
I've got to get back to work.

28:54.649 --> 28:56.025
So I'll catch up
with you guys later.

28:56.025 --> 28:56.985
Alright.

28:57.193 --> 28:59.863
(country music)

29:01.740 --> 29:04.159
- I want to thank you again
for a delightful performance.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.660
- I'm glad y'all made it.

29:05.869 --> 29:08.496
- You know, that Gerri's
really something special.

29:08.496 --> 29:10.331
- One of the best
athletes I ever seen.

29:10.331 --> 29:11.207
That's no lie.

29:11.207 --> 29:12.667
But you know what they say?

29:12.834 --> 29:16.004
Pussy is a mother fucker's
quickest downfall.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.839
Take care of my girl, all right?

29:17.839 --> 29:19.340
She's an asshole I know,

29:19.340 --> 29:20.925
but there ain't
nothing she can't do

29:20.925 --> 29:23.720
if she put her mind
to it and that include

29:27.766 --> 29:28.850
- Curling.

29:28.850 --> 29:29.768
- Curling?

29:29.768 --> 29:31.519
When they sweeping
on ice and shit?

29:31.770 --> 29:33.188
(laughing)

29:34.189 --> 29:35.857
That ain't no sport.

29:35.857 --> 29:38.359
I met as well get my fat
ass out there and do it.

29:38.359 --> 29:39.694
- Please do me a favor

29:39.694 --> 29:40.862
and get her home soon

29:40.862 --> 29:42.739
so she can be on time
for the match tomorrow.

29:43.740 --> 29:46.910
And Gerri, eight
a.m., don't forget.

29:54.709 --> 29:57.295
(upbeat music)

30:10.767 --> 30:11.810
They're late.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.395
And where have you been?

30:14.729 --> 30:18.733
(speaking in foreign language)

30:28.326 --> 30:32.247
- Fuck man, this is
America, speak English.

30:32.413 --> 30:33.748
(speaking in foreign language)

30:33.748 --> 30:36.000
- This is Miami.

30:36.167 --> 30:39.629
(speaking in foreign language)

30:41.422 --> 30:43.299
- Where are you?

30:43.967 --> 30:46.261
(speaking in foreign language)

30:47.428 --> 30:52.433
(alarm blaring)
(ominous music)

31:13.454 --> 31:15.039
- Those bitches robbed me!

31:16.624 --> 31:17.458
Fuck!

31:18.835 --> 31:19.627
Shit!

31:20.461 --> 31:23.298
(dramatic music)

31:29.304 --> 31:30.555
- What the hell?

31:30.972 --> 31:33.308
- Man, bitches ain't shit.

31:33.308 --> 31:36.644
- Hey, nice tits, Gordo,
long time, no see.

31:36.644 --> 31:38.021
- Who's this fuck boy?

31:38.021 --> 31:39.856
- Woah, I don't want any
beef with you, sir.

31:39.856 --> 31:40.648
- Sir?

31:40.982 --> 31:43.318
- This is the captain
of the All Curl Revue,

31:43.318 --> 31:44.819
our opponents today.

31:44.819 --> 31:46.154
- So maybe afterwards

31:46.738 --> 31:49.032
I might let you take
this for a spin.

31:49.824 --> 31:51.367
- I gotta a spin for your ass.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.703
- [Brett] Gordon!

31:53.745 --> 31:54.996
- Give me a minute.

31:58.374 --> 32:00.668
(ominous music)

32:05.340 --> 32:08.843
- I have to say that I am
truly disappointed in you.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.930
- What did you do?

32:12.347 --> 32:14.599
- Just told them about
your little scam.

32:14.724 --> 32:17.769
Paying players in an
amateur tournament.

32:18.394 --> 32:20.396
(speaking in foreign language)

32:20.605 --> 32:22.690
Shame on you.

32:22.941 --> 32:26.527
- And I was truly
rooting for you, Gordon,

32:27.528 --> 32:31.074
but this is disgraceful.

32:31.532 --> 32:35.286
You've got 15 minutes
find a new player

32:35.286 --> 32:37.705
or you're gonna have to forfeit.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.718
(ominous music)

32:52.929 --> 32:54.764
- What did you do?

32:54.889 --> 32:56.224
- What the fuck
you done did now?

32:56.224 --> 32:58.476
(speaking in foreign language)

32:59.227 --> 33:02.271
- I had to come
clean, Gordo, my bad.

33:02.271 --> 33:03.898
- My bad, what?

33:03.898 --> 33:04.899
- What's going on?

33:04.899 --> 33:06.901
- Rico just got disqualified.

33:06.901 --> 33:08.403
(speaking in foreign language)

33:08.569 --> 33:10.655
- No, your money just
got us disqualified.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.448
- What did my sister give you?

33:12.615 --> 33:13.741
(mimics buzzing)

33:13.825 --> 33:15.910
You knew how much
this meant to me.

33:16.077 --> 33:17.954
- Got a way better deal though.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.247
- Better deal, huh?

33:19.455 --> 33:20.456
[punch]

33:23.251 --> 33:24.752
- What is happening here?

33:24.752 --> 33:27.422
- That beast just physically
assaulted someone.

33:27.422 --> 33:28.798
- [Gerri] Bitch!

33:28.798 --> 33:30.842
- The whole team
should be disqualified.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.427
- Call me out my name again

33:32.427 --> 33:33.928
and yo ass gon' be next.

33:33.928 --> 33:35.430
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.764
Enough is enough, okay?

33:36.806 --> 33:37.640
It's time.

33:39.183 --> 33:42.311
Either you have a third
party or you're disqualified.

33:43.187 --> 33:45.982
(dramatic music)

33:49.610 --> 33:55.116
- I'm gonna get you bitch.

34:00.538 --> 34:03.458
(suave club music)

35:19.909 --> 35:21.619
- Come on, you got this.

35:22.703 --> 35:25.123
(club music)

35:31.087 --> 35:33.047
- I put the faith on you.

35:33.047 --> 35:35.133
- Fuck up dem gigalos!

35:38.761 --> 35:41.389
- Go soft and try to
split their stones

35:41.389 --> 35:43.141
and try to knock their
top one out of place.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.726
And Nina, sweep hard to the left

35:45.726 --> 35:47.562
so that the stone
picks up any speed.

35:47.562 --> 35:48.729
Got it?
- Okay, okay.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.733
(club music)

35:57.947 --> 35:59.824
- Eat shit, gigolos.

36:00.741 --> 36:03.161
(club music)

36:08.583 --> 36:10.459
(cheering)

36:10.459 --> 36:12.920
(club music)

36:15.756 --> 36:17.758
- Come on, Geraldine,
get it going.

36:24.098 --> 36:25.141
- Practice run.

36:25.141 --> 36:26.601
It's okay Nina.

36:26.601 --> 36:29.437
(speaking in foreign language)

36:29.437 --> 36:30.146
- Me?

36:30.146 --> 36:31.022
(speaking in foreign language)

36:31.022 --> 36:32.106
- You're sweeping
is embarrassing.

36:32.106 --> 36:33.316
I'm starting to think

36:33.316 --> 36:35.484
your online sweeping
business is bullshit.

36:35.484 --> 36:37.111
- Man, how long
we gotta do this?

36:37.111 --> 36:38.362
- It's eight rounds.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.531
Didn't you learn
anything from that video?

36:40.531 --> 36:41.699
- No.

36:43.951 --> 36:46.120
- Curl harder, curl harder.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.624
(cheering)

36:55.838 --> 36:58.299
(club music)

37:04.639 --> 37:06.641
- You shit gigolo.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.521
(cheering)
(club music)

37:21.489 --> 37:22.698
- This is it.

37:22.698 --> 37:25.493
We have to make
every point count.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.161
Gerri, you hit it
from the inside

37:27.161 --> 37:28.996
and Nina will bring
it home for the win.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.415
(club music)

37:34.168 --> 37:36.170
- Fuck up those gigolos.

37:43.886 --> 37:46.264
(club music)

37:55.690 --> 37:58.067
- Now those guys know
how to fucking curl.

38:01.737 --> 38:03.739
- That's some bullshit.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.791
- Well, it was
hard fought match.

38:14.083 --> 38:17.920
Good effort.

38:18.879 --> 38:20.798
Anyway, don't hang
your head ladies.

38:21.799 --> 38:25.303
Got another two weeks
and try it again.

38:25.761 --> 38:27.388
- Who are we playing?

38:27.471 --> 38:29.765
- Only the top team
in south Florida.

38:30.766 --> 38:32.435
- The So Flow Curls?

38:34.395 --> 38:35.730
- Who are they?

38:35.730 --> 38:37.398
(speaking in foreign language)

38:37.648 --> 38:40.067
- Only one of the top
teams in the country.

38:40.109 --> 38:42.153
They migrated Minnesota
to South Florida

38:42.153 --> 38:43.946
during the cold winter of 2000.

38:44.280 --> 38:48.284
- And they haven't lost a
match in 20 years. (laughs)

38:48.743 --> 38:50.828
- You know every time
you open your mouth

38:50.828 --> 38:52.997
I want to knock your
teeth out, bitch.

38:53.956 --> 38:55.249
(speaking in foreign language)

38:55.916 --> 38:57.668
- Can I borrow you for a minute?

38:58.419 --> 38:59.253
- Of course.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.592
- Eight o'clock
tomorrow morning.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.927
- And how are we
supposed to beat them?

39:07.178 --> 39:08.012
- Faith.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.015
- Man, get the fuck out.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.350
We done.

39:17.146 --> 39:18.814
- Where have you been?

39:18.981 --> 39:20.274
- Well I had a few
errands this morning.

39:20.274 --> 39:21.150
I started with the dry cleaner.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.443
- Zip it.

39:22.818 --> 39:25.029
And you, you were worried.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.950
- Well, I have to
admit I was worried

39:29.950 --> 39:34.288
but after watching
Gordon and those idiots

39:35.623 --> 39:38.626
I am sure that we're
gonna make South Florida

39:38.626 --> 39:43.214
the center of the curling
world with his inheritance.

39:44.673 --> 39:46.008
- Hey, is he gonna be okay?

39:47.468 --> 39:51.138
- No, he's entering
funnel territory.

39:52.807 --> 39:53.974
- Funnel?

39:54.642 --> 39:57.311
(quirky music)

40:04.652 --> 40:06.362
- Our father was a strict man

40:06.362 --> 40:07.822
and he always pressured Gordon

40:07.822 --> 40:09.865
into taking over
the family business.

40:09.865 --> 40:13.661
And when Gordon would
disappoint, which was always,

40:13.869 --> 40:15.329
he would turn to the funnel.

40:21.752 --> 40:24.004
(groaning)

40:44.942 --> 40:46.193
- He's gonna die.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.446
- Not soon enough.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.714
(soft music)

41:07.756 --> 41:10.426
(phone ringing)

41:12.887 --> 41:14.388
(groaning)

41:18.601 --> 41:19.435
- Hey.

41:19.935 --> 41:21.395
Who in the hell
call somebody

41:21.395 --> 41:23.898
at five o'clock in the morning?

41:24.732 --> 41:26.233
Is somebody dead?

41:27.818 --> 41:31.155
Oh, all right, I'll be there.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.454
Oh shit.

41:41.415 --> 41:44.335
(mysterious music)

41:49.757 --> 41:52.843
- What in the hell are
you doing Geraldine?

41:52.843 --> 41:55.429
- Pops, what's good?

41:55.930 --> 41:58.098
Can I get you one of these?

41:58.098 --> 42:00.267
- Girl, ain't you got
practice tomorrow?

42:00.684 --> 42:03.812
- Man that shit over.

42:03.812 --> 42:05.981
- Girl, where you
get all this money?

42:06.649 --> 42:08.943
- So I called the
addiction specialist.

42:09.443 --> 42:11.278
They taught me to control
my booty cravings.

42:13.322 --> 42:15.032
- What's wrong with you?

42:15.032 --> 42:16.450
It ain't over.

42:16.450 --> 42:18.285
There's one more game.

42:18.327 --> 42:20.621
- You was there yesterday.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.498
You was there.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.292
We finished.

42:25.292 --> 42:26.460
- When you gonna stop

42:26.460 --> 42:28.170
giving up on yourself
before you start?

42:29.171 --> 42:31.632
- Oh so now you care?

42:32.007 --> 42:34.969
Now you want to be a dad?

42:35.052 --> 42:36.679
- I'm always your dad.

42:36.679 --> 42:39.306
- Where was you after the draft?

42:39.306 --> 42:41.809
When I lost everything,
where was you?

42:41.809 --> 42:43.561
- You forgot all I did for you?

42:44.353 --> 42:46.647
You made the draft
because of me.

42:46.647 --> 42:50.734
- Yeah, you was a good
coach or whatever,

42:50.734 --> 42:54.321
but when I needed a
dad, you wasn't there.

42:54.697 --> 42:58.867
Man, take your ass home unless
you want to pay for this.

43:00.869 --> 43:02.329
- I'll take her home.

43:03.831 --> 43:06.250
- She grown, not
my problem anymore.

43:19.847 --> 43:22.016
(speaking in foreign language)

43:22.349 --> 43:24.059
(giggling)

43:25.853 --> 43:28.689
- What is you doing
in my house, stripper?

43:28.689 --> 43:30.524
- It's Lola, honey.

43:30.524 --> 43:33.360
- That don't answer
why you in my house.

43:34.194 --> 43:37.114
- I told your papa I would
take care of you last week

43:37.114 --> 43:39.116
so (giggling)

43:39.742 --> 43:41.869
- A week, last week?

43:42.202 --> 43:44.371
- Yeah, you've been
in a coma for 10 days.

43:44.371 --> 43:46.957
I've being here
taking care of you.

43:46.957 --> 43:49.293
I wouldn't let
anything happen to you.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.253
Okay, mi amor?

43:51.629 --> 43:52.713
- What's going on?

43:52.713 --> 43:54.048
(groaning)

43:54.048 --> 43:56.258
I can't move my legs.

43:56.258 --> 43:59.219
- Oh yeah, you were
temporarily paralyzed

43:59.386 --> 44:02.890
but I nursed you back to health.

44:03.390 --> 44:05.726
- Who else in my house?

44:05.768 --> 44:09.772
- Well I had to take the
week off to take care of you

44:09.772 --> 44:13.901
so I had to conduct some
business out of our house.

44:13.984 --> 44:16.737
And tada!

44:16.987 --> 44:18.072
Ready?

44:18.072 --> 44:19.448
Hop on.

44:19.740 --> 44:22.910
- Bitch, didn't I say
I can't move my legs?

44:23.744 --> 44:26.246
(gentle music)

44:32.002 --> 44:33.754
- There you go.

44:34.630 --> 44:36.590
- What these ho's
doing in my house?

44:36.757 --> 44:38.759
- I ain't no ho,
control your girl.

44:38.759 --> 44:39.760
- Relax.

44:41.261 --> 44:44.473
You, we're guests.

44:44.598 --> 44:46.475
Do not disrespect.

44:50.104 --> 44:53.440
Look, they were gonna
take your house.

44:53.440 --> 44:57.027
So me and my girl, we had
to make some extra money.

44:57.277 --> 44:58.112
- You're welcome.

44:59.780 --> 45:01.615
- We set up in here.

45:01.615 --> 45:05.119
But don't worry, I locked her
bedroom through the parties.

45:05.119 --> 45:06.286
- Parties?

45:06.328 --> 45:07.162
- Big ones.

45:07.287 --> 45:08.956
- Mmhmm, we entertained
a couple of times

45:08.956 --> 45:10.457
just to make some money.

45:11.542 --> 45:13.127
I couldn't leave you alone.

45:13.127 --> 45:14.628
I needed to work from home.

45:14.628 --> 45:15.462
- Home?

45:15.462 --> 45:16.714
This my house.

45:16.964 --> 45:18.298
Ain't nobody come by?

45:18.298 --> 45:21.301
- Yeah, your dad, he did
come a couple of times.

45:21.343 --> 45:23.053
He actually stayed
for the parties.

45:23.053 --> 45:26.974
- Okay hot pudding,
let that booty roll.

45:27.641 --> 45:28.809
- And my team?

45:30.310 --> 45:31.812
- About that...

45:31.812 --> 45:34.022
(flushing)

45:37.067 --> 45:38.652
- Thank you for a nice evening.

45:47.411 --> 45:49.037
Why are you so distant?

45:49.037 --> 45:51.081
You were never like this before.

45:51.373 --> 45:53.041
- Man, I was in a coma.

45:56.211 --> 45:57.921
(knocking)

46:03.844 --> 46:05.220
Where's Gordo?

46:05.596 --> 46:06.680
- You lived,

46:08.682 --> 46:09.850
What a shame.

46:09.850 --> 46:11.351
- Move bitch.

46:11.435 --> 46:13.854
- You know you can't roll
up into my house like this.

46:15.773 --> 46:18.734
You know my brother's very
sick and he can't be disturbed.

46:18.734 --> 46:22.029
- You're gonna let (speaking
in foreign language).

46:23.614 --> 46:26.033
- You know you can't help
that fat fuck anyway.

46:33.916 --> 46:35.459
- What happened?

46:35.459 --> 46:38.754
- The inevitable, tubo
ate himself to death.

46:44.051 --> 46:46.929
- Get up coach, man, we
still got work to do.

46:47.971 --> 46:49.973
- Isn't that precious?

47:00.567 --> 47:02.277
(groaning)

47:03.987 --> 47:05.280
- Something's happening.

47:09.827 --> 47:12.329
- Nothing, it's feeding time.

47:13.622 --> 47:16.166
(gentle music)

47:19.586 --> 47:21.338
- Come on, big guy,

47:21.630 --> 47:23.257
I know you in there somewhere.

47:27.094 --> 47:28.136
Wake up!

47:30.514 --> 47:32.432
(groaning)

47:40.148 --> 47:42.776
- Guacamole, is that you?

47:45.153 --> 47:46.613
What happened?

47:46.613 --> 47:49.032
- Just don't move, okay?

47:49.032 --> 47:50.450
Relax.

47:50.617 --> 47:51.952
- Gerri?

47:51.994 --> 47:52.953
- I'm here, coach.

47:54.454 --> 47:55.622
- Coach?

47:56.874 --> 47:58.000
Coach.

47:59.626 --> 48:02.170
(gentle music)

48:07.801 --> 48:08.802
Do something.

48:08.802 --> 48:11.305
No stop, oh my God.

48:12.389 --> 48:13.223
But,

48:14.558 --> 48:15.559
how?

48:17.060 --> 48:18.645
- This ain't my first coma.

48:18.812 --> 48:20.689
Let's get the band
back together.

48:20.689 --> 48:23.066
- And how the hell
am I supposed to go?

48:36.663 --> 48:39.207
- You'll be walking
within five hours max

48:39.416 --> 48:42.252
and don't worry, the night
terrors go away in a few weeks.

48:49.176 --> 48:50.010
- He woke up.

48:52.763 --> 48:55.933
I know, the pig in
the blanket won't die.

48:56.516 --> 48:58.393
You better take care of him.

48:58.393 --> 49:01.355
If not, the curling
center and the money,

49:01.355 --> 49:03.023
it all goes up in smoke.

49:04.441 --> 49:06.860
(dark music)

49:11.031 --> 49:13.533
(upbeat music)

49:22.042 --> 49:24.628
- Nina, we're here to rescue you

49:24.628 --> 49:27.089
from a life of
indentured servitude.

49:27.089 --> 49:30.968
(speaking in foreign language)

49:33.804 --> 49:36.223
- It don't look like
she want to be saved.

49:36.223 --> 49:38.433
- Human trafficking is no joke.

49:38.558 --> 49:41.395
You of all people
should understand that.

49:41.395 --> 49:43.397
- What that supposed to mean?

49:43.397 --> 49:44.773
- We will protect you.

49:44.773 --> 49:46.149
Run to your freedom.

49:46.149 --> 49:48.443
(speaking in foreign language)

49:50.237 --> 49:51.571
- All right,

49:55.993 --> 49:58.161
She won't be needing this.

50:04.751 --> 50:06.086
That's going with me.

50:09.506 --> 50:12.759
- Well that's it,
I'm officially poor.

50:12.759 --> 50:15.012
Where do you guys
get your food stamps?

50:15.095 --> 50:16.847
- So you just gonna give up?

50:16.847 --> 50:20.767
(speaking in foreign language)

50:22.144 --> 50:24.479
- You know a good
restaurant around here?

50:24.479 --> 50:25.605
Last one buys.

50:25.605 --> 50:26.356
Not it.

50:26.356 --> 50:27.107
- Oh, not it.

50:27.107 --> 50:30.193
(speaking in foreign language)

50:34.364 --> 50:36.158
- I think I know a spot.

50:38.618 --> 50:41.538
(mysterious music)

50:48.670 --> 50:51.339
(speaking in foreign language)

50:51.339 --> 50:53.383
- Yeah, pops talked

50:53.383 --> 50:54.342
we can practice here.

50:56.178 --> 50:58.513

50:58.972 --> 51:01.516
(upbeat music)

51:10.817 --> 51:12.235
(groaning)

51:16.031 --> 51:18.075
- Yeah, mother fucker!
Yeah!

51:18.492 --> 51:21.078
(upbeat music)

51:32.380 --> 51:34.257
(country music)

51:45.393 --> 51:47.354
What the hell are you doing?

51:47.354 --> 51:49.773
- You bout to be a big sister.

51:49.773 --> 51:51.775
- Are you serious?

51:51.775 --> 51:55.237
- Yes, little mulato on his way.

51:55.737 --> 51:56.738
- Bruh.

51:56.738 --> 51:59.783
- Shit, I still got the thunder.

51:59.950 --> 52:00.909
- Come on, man.

52:00.909 --> 52:02.410
You better sit your old ass down

52:02.410 --> 52:04.412
before you gone through
your hip out of place.

52:08.750 --> 52:09.918
- Have a toast with me.

52:11.378 --> 52:14.589
To the family and
the fire in my loins.

52:14.589 --> 52:16.716
- Come on, man, it ain't
got to be all that.

52:16.758 --> 52:18.218
- Now I know you didn't
just come over here

52:18.218 --> 52:20.220
just to have a drink
with your old man.

52:20.387 --> 52:21.388
What's on your mind?

52:23.140 --> 52:25.559
- I just wanted to
make sure we was good.

52:25.934 --> 52:27.227
- You're an asshole

52:27.394 --> 52:30.230
but you always gonna
be my child so we good.

52:31.606 --> 52:33.942
I'm gonna be there
cheering you on

52:33.942 --> 52:35.819
like I have all your life.

52:36.611 --> 52:37.737
- Thanks pop.

52:38.405 --> 52:39.906
- You know this
don't change things

52:39.906 --> 52:40.949
how I care about you?

52:40.949 --> 52:44.619
- Man, listen, I'm
almost 40 years old.

52:44.786 --> 52:46.246
If you want to be
running around here

52:46.246 --> 52:49.332
with little jits in
your '70s, be my guest.

52:49.332 --> 52:51.668
- Geraldine, you
don't understand.

52:51.751 --> 52:54.087
It's nice to have a
little love in the house.

52:55.338 --> 52:57.424
Plus, my new medicine

52:57.424 --> 52:59.759
put a little lead back
in the old pencil.

52:59.759 --> 53:01.428
- Man, why you?

53:02.179 --> 53:04.431
- We're gonna give those
misfits a good spanking,

53:04.764 --> 53:06.183
South Florida style.

53:06.183 --> 53:07.642
- And what do you
think about that?

53:07.642 --> 53:09.102
- I think it's blasphemy

53:09.102 --> 53:10.687
It's a mockery of a good sport

53:10.687 --> 53:12.272
and they think that
they can just show up

53:12.272 --> 53:14.274
and learn how to
sweep in a few weeks.

53:14.316 --> 53:17.611
And that football
player, Gerri, is it,

53:17.611 --> 53:19.279
what cage did they
find her from?

53:20.780 --> 53:23.200
- Gerri, go back to
the black sports.

53:25.952 --> 53:27.704
- That was a tad racist.

53:28.038 --> 53:29.497
Back to you, Ted.

53:29.539 --> 53:31.333
- What the fuck
they talking 'bout?

53:33.543 --> 53:36.546
- Beat their mother fucking
ass tomorrow, Geraldine.

53:42.385 --> 53:45.222
(whimsical music)

54:06.159 --> 54:07.494
- Let me guess.
- Geez.

54:07.494 --> 54:09.079
- You slept walked
into the kitchen again?

54:09.829 --> 54:11.331
- I had a light dinner.

54:11.331 --> 54:12.082
- Mmhmm.

54:12.082 --> 54:13.541
- What are you doing up?

54:14.042 --> 54:17.337
- Somebody in this family has
to put in some actual work

54:17.545 --> 54:19.172
while you eat yourself to death.

54:19.881 --> 54:23.551
- Ugh, I've had enough,
I'm going to bed.

54:24.010 --> 54:25.387
Good luck tomorrow, loser.

54:26.680 --> 54:27.514
- Bitch.

54:32.894 --> 54:35.397
(tense music)

54:46.199 --> 54:49.369
A land deal with
Commissioner Pottinger?

54:50.704 --> 54:53.415
South Florida Curling Complex?

54:55.208 --> 54:57.711
(tense music)

55:06.052 --> 55:07.929
What are you doing here?

55:08.388 --> 55:10.390
- I can't wish my
brother good luck?

55:10.807 --> 55:12.642
Look, it's a big day and all

55:12.642 --> 55:15.979
and I thought that you should
have dad's curling broom

55:15.979 --> 55:17.063
for the big match.

55:17.230 --> 55:18.064
- Aw.

55:22.444 --> 55:25.071
- Nighty night, big brother.

55:25.238 --> 55:28.116
You will not fuck
this deal up for me.

55:37.417 --> 55:40.003
(upbeat music)

55:52.849 --> 55:54.601
(gentle music)

56:13.119 --> 56:15.121
(speaking in foreign language)

56:15.789 --> 56:17.499
- Whatever the fuck you said.

56:23.546 --> 56:25.048
Oh hey pops.

56:25.465 --> 56:26.883
- Ain't mine.

56:27.300 --> 56:28.134
- What?

56:29.344 --> 56:30.553
- That baby.

56:30.678 --> 56:32.347
I made sure of that.

56:32.680 --> 56:35.308
I only do anal at
the strip club.

56:35.683 --> 56:37.727
- I'm not pregnant, okay?

56:38.311 --> 56:40.647
I'm here with mi amor.

56:41.731 --> 56:43.650
- My Geraldine?

56:43.650 --> 56:47.195
- Yeah, we just had a
connection, you know?

56:47.195 --> 56:48.822
And the sex, and the sex is-

56:48.822 --> 56:50.240
- Not another damn word.

56:51.199 --> 56:53.076
- Like father, like daughter.

56:55.578 --> 56:57.539
- What the shit is this?

56:57.539 --> 56:59.666
We curling on the
soccer field now?

56:59.666 --> 57:01.209
(speaking in foreign language)

57:01.543 --> 57:03.420
- Man, how long you
been in America?

57:03.420 --> 57:05.588
You don't speak English yet?

57:06.673 --> 57:08.091
(speaking in foreign language)

57:08.883 --> 57:09.717
- The fuck?

57:11.845 --> 57:13.555
What is you doing here?

57:13.930 --> 57:16.391
- Hi, mi amor.

57:16.683 --> 57:20.103
I'm working the day
shift so I thought

57:20.395 --> 57:22.856
I'll take my break
to watch you play.

57:22.856 --> 57:23.857
- Oh no.

57:25.024 --> 57:27.193
- Geraldine, you

57:27.527 --> 57:29.612
- I ain't no ho, okay?

57:29.612 --> 57:32.866
I've changed since we've
been living together.

57:32.949 --> 57:35.869
- Geraldine, you've got
this ho up in your house?

57:35.869 --> 57:37.120
- Our house.

57:37.579 --> 57:38.580

57:41.040 --> 57:42.792

57:43.251 --> 57:45.920

57:46.212 --> 57:47.255

57:54.554 --> 57:56.598
- Yeah, she's a diddy bitch.

57:59.225 --> 58:01.811
(upbeat music)

58:11.905 --> 58:14.449
- God damn Nazis are coming.

58:15.992 --> 58:18.244
(flushing)

58:22.749 --> 58:24.250
(farting)

58:30.173 --> 58:31.299
(clears throat)

58:38.848 --> 58:40.099
- There you are.

58:42.143 --> 58:46.773
So is everything in order?

58:47.148 --> 58:49.651
- You have nothing
to worry about.

58:49.692 --> 58:53.363
Let's just you say
Gordon is dead tired.

58:55.990 --> 58:56.824
- Perfect.

59:04.832 --> 59:05.625
- [Female] I think he looks

59:05.625 --> 59:08.628
really cute in yellow.
That's what I think.

59:10.797 --> 59:13.174
Where's your portly
third member?

59:13.216 --> 59:16.803
Or is this on the team now?

59:16.803 --> 59:18.012
- This?

59:18.012 --> 59:20.515
I have a pistola in my
bolsa, little bitch.

59:20.515 --> 59:23.851
- Mmm, gang violence in curling,

59:23.851 --> 59:25.395

59:25.812 --> 59:27.230
- Oh he'll be here.

59:27.814 --> 59:30.149
- He better hurry, the
match is about to start.

59:30.483 --> 59:32.026
Although it won't matter.

59:32.151 --> 59:33.319
Afterwards, I'm gonna have

59:48.334 --> 59:50.837

1:00:11.190 --> 1:00:12.609
(sniffing)

1:00:15.528 --> 1:00:17.530
- Help, help, help!

1:00:23.286 --> 1:00:25.622
- Pop, we can't find Gordon.

1:00:25.955 --> 1:00:27.749

1:00:27.749 --> 1:00:29.584

1:00:30.793 --> 1:00:31.878
- Pop.

1:00:32.420 --> 1:00:34.631
Aight, I'll go check on him.

- I'll drive.

1:00:35.548 --> 1:00:37.133
I know where he stays.

1:00:37.216 --> 1:00:39.302
Got to make sure
mi amor is fine.

1:00:40.553 --> 1:00:43.723
- Y'all hurry up,

1:00:43.723 --> 1:00:45.058
Damn, man.

1:00:46.225 --> 1:00:48.936

1:00:52.982 --> 1:00:54.400

1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:55.234

1:00:56.444 --> 1:00:57.487
- I see lights coming.

1:01:00.406 --> 1:01:02.825
- Help, I'm in here!

1:01:02.825 --> 1:01:03.785
- Hurry up.

1:01:03.785 --> 1:01:05.078
You know I'm black as night.

1:01:05.078 --> 1:01:07.163
They done called the
police already.

1:01:07.789 --> 1:01:08.956
- I'm doing it.

1:01:09.082 --> 1:01:09.916
Just relax.

1:01:13.586 --> 1:01:14.420
Yes, yes.

1:01:20.593 --> 1:01:21.928
- I'm in here!

1:01:23.096 --> 1:01:24.305
Get these things off me.

1:01:27.016 --> 1:01:28.267
Thank God.

1:01:31.020 --> 1:01:31.854
- There we go.

1:01:36.192 --> 1:01:38.444
(groaning)

1:01:40.780 --> 1:01:43.032
(tense music)

1:01:44.784 --> 1:01:48.955
- Well ladies, can't hold
this match up any longer.

1:01:48.955 --> 1:01:52.792
If Gordon is not here in
the next five minutes,

1:01:53.793 --> 1:01:55.128
got to forfeit the match.

1:01:57.630 --> 1:01:59.799
- What's the concern everyone?

1:01:59.799 --> 1:02:02.468
- I know you did this,
you raggedy ass bitch.

1:02:03.886 --> 1:02:06.180
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1:02:06.180 --> 1:02:07.473
- I'm gonna knock your ass out

1:02:07.473 --> 1:02:09.142
before the day over
with, believe that.

1:02:09.142 --> 1:02:10.893
- I'm so scared.

1:02:11.644 --> 1:02:15.022
- Let's not do that.
- Wait, wait, I'm here.

1:02:17.233 --> 1:02:20.153
(victorious music)

1:02:36.586 --> 1:02:37.336
- Mmhmm.

1:02:39.547 --> 1:02:41.048
(laughing)

1:02:41.174 --> 1:02:45.386
- He ran out of time as he
ran his fat ass from the car.

1:02:45.386 --> 1:02:48.181
Commissioner, call the match.

1:02:49.348 --> 1:02:50.683
- I'm here.

1:02:55.772 --> 1:02:56.856
I'm here.

1:02:58.357 --> 1:03:00.401
I'm (barfing)

1:03:02.403 --> 1:03:03.362
- What the fuck?

1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:05.364
Someone clean this up.

1:03:05.364 --> 1:03:08.034
- It's only bacon,
it'll come right out.

1:03:08.367 --> 1:03:10.369
- Oh God damn it.

1:03:10.369 --> 1:03:11.412
- I'm ready.

1:03:16.417 --> 1:03:21.130
- Well, I guess the match is on.

1:03:25.051 --> 1:03:27.637
(upbeat music)

1:03:38.231 --> 1:03:40.983
All right, here we are.

1:03:41.984 --> 1:03:43.736
Now you know the rules.

1:03:45.071 --> 1:03:46.405
Great Gadbury's,

1:03:49.242 --> 1:03:50.743
if you lose this match,

1:03:50.743 --> 1:03:53.830
you are eliminated and will
not move on to regionals.

1:03:56.415 --> 1:04:00.795
So Flow Curls, are you ready?

1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:02.171
- Yeah.

1:04:03.422 --> 1:04:05.299
- Great Gadbury's,
are you ready?

1:04:05.299 --> 1:04:06.467
- [All] Yeah.

1:04:06.467 --> 1:04:07.426
- Hell yeah.

1:04:07.426 --> 1:04:13.432
- All right, well let's
get ready to curl.

1:04:13.975 --> 1:04:18.020
- Hoes before bros. (laughs)

1:04:18.104 --> 1:04:19.939
- That ain't even
how that shit go.

1:04:23.109 --> 1:04:26.487
(clock ticking)
(tense music)

1:04:29.156 --> 1:04:31.450
- Now, I grew up
with these D-bags.

1:04:31.450 --> 1:04:33.452
Let's try to block 'em at
the top of the bullseye

1:04:33.452 --> 1:04:34.704
and we've got a chance.

1:04:35.788 --> 1:04:37.331
- Now you now you ain't
grow with these kids

1:04:37.331 --> 1:04:38.708
with your old ass

1:04:38.708 --> 1:04:40.293
but it's good to
have you back, Gordo.

1:04:40.334 --> 1:04:41.669
(speaking in foreign language)

1:04:41.669 --> 1:04:42.461
Break!

1:04:44.046 --> 1:04:46.549
(tense music)

1:05:50.696 --> 1:05:52.573
- Come on girls,
there's still time.

1:05:52.615 --> 1:05:53.950
I know we can do this.

1:05:53.950 --> 1:05:55.409
We've practiced so hard.

1:05:56.369 --> 1:05:57.578
- All right, everyone.

1:05:57.578 --> 1:05:58.496
That's half time.

1:05:58.496 --> 1:05:59.372
Take 10.

1:06:01.707 --> 1:06:03.793
- Save the embarrassment
and quit now.

1:06:03.793 --> 1:06:05.920
There's no turning
back after this.

1:06:06.170 --> 1:06:08.464
- Gadbury's never quit.

1:06:08.464 --> 1:06:10.424
- Save that talk for
the soup kitchen.

1:06:10.758 --> 1:06:12.885
- Come on girls, I
know we're down, but-

1:06:13.052 --> 1:06:14.887
- We done.

1:06:14.887 --> 1:06:16.222
They some real white boys,

1:06:16.222 --> 1:06:17.431
we can't beat that.

1:06:17.556 --> 1:06:20.267
- We just have to
have some faith.

1:06:20.267 --> 1:06:21.560
(groans)

1:06:27.316 --> 1:06:28.609
(farting)

1:06:29.694 --> 1:06:30.736
- Party time.

1:06:31.904 --> 1:06:33.406
(tense music)

1:06:34.991 --> 1:06:37.201
(pooping)

1:06:45.584 --> 1:06:46.252
(gunfire blasting)

1:06:46.252 --> 1:06:47.086
(groaning)

1:06:50.256 --> 1:06:51.424
(gunfire blasting)

1:06:56.512 --> 1:06:58.597
(groaning)

1:06:59.473 --> 1:07:00.516
(gasps)

1:07:03.853 --> 1:07:05.104
- His dick.

1:07:12.361 --> 1:07:13.237
Sven's dead.

1:07:13.237 --> 1:07:15.156
Oh my God, something
happened to him, he's dead.

1:07:15.573 --> 1:07:16.615
- What the hell?

1:07:17.783 --> 1:07:19.035
- What's going on?

1:07:22.538 --> 1:07:23.748
- This isn't good.

1:07:27.418 --> 1:07:28.794
- So what do we do?

1:07:31.505 --> 1:07:32.631
- Well I,

1:07:34.467 --> 1:07:39.138
So Flow Curlers, if you don't
have another player then

1:07:40.014 --> 1:07:41.682
you're gonna have to forfeit.

1:07:43.768 --> 1:07:44.977
- What do you mean?

1:07:45.394 --> 1:07:46.979
Sven is dead.

1:07:46.979 --> 1:07:48.230
Who would do that?

1:07:48.230 --> 1:07:51.692
- No, no, no, no, no,
we need to reschedule.

1:07:51.692 --> 1:07:53.486
You need to
reschedule the match.

1:07:53.486 --> 1:08:00.326
- No, I understand but
curling waits for no one.

1:08:02.286 --> 1:08:07.333
So the winner who goes
on to the regionals is

1:08:10.836 --> 1:08:12.755
the Great Gadbury's.

1:08:13.047 --> 1:08:16.008
- What, I couldn't hear you?

1:08:16.383 --> 1:08:20.513
- I said the Great Gadbury's?

1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:24.015
(cheering)
(upbeat music)

1:08:24.183 --> 1:08:26.059
- You animals, he's dead.

1:08:26.059 --> 1:08:27.937
(cheering)

1:08:28.062 --> 1:08:30.064
- This cannot be happening.

1:08:30.064 --> 1:08:31.232
- I'm rich.

1:08:31.232 --> 1:08:34.026
- We got it all, all
our money, that's mine.

1:08:34.527 --> 1:08:36.278
(speaking in foreign language)

1:08:37.279 --> 1:08:38.197
- Yes.

1:08:38.197 --> 1:08:40.532
- Gordon, this is for you.

1:08:42.993 --> 1:08:45.496
(tense music)

1:08:46.746 --> 1:08:48.749
- Where the fuck have
you been all day?

1:08:49.541 --> 1:08:50.542
- Funny story-

1:08:50.542 --> 1:08:52.253
(shushing)

1:09:03.639 --> 1:09:05.724
- That shit don't
happen in black sports.

1:09:09.103 --> 1:09:11.772
(ominous music)

1:09:16.735 --> 1:09:18.529
- Son, I'm assuming you failed

1:09:18.529 --> 1:09:21.073
to complete the task I gave you

1:09:21.073 --> 1:09:24.243
so I sent in a spy
to assure your win.

1:09:24.493 --> 1:09:28.289
You're too important to the
Gadbury name to be a loser.

1:09:28.872 --> 1:09:31.584
If any nefarious
activity took place,

1:09:31.750 --> 1:09:35.086
you will find in the
safe a signed pardon

1:09:35.086 --> 1:09:37.715
by my pal Ronald Reagan.

1:09:38.591 --> 1:09:41.719
The fortune is yours,
Gordon, all of it.

1:09:42.011 --> 1:09:44.805
I'll be damned if I
let a fat backside

1:09:44.805 --> 1:09:46.807
and a tongue that rolls her R's,

1:09:47.183 --> 1:09:49.434
oh those R's,

1:09:49.434 --> 1:09:52.979
damned if I let that
spoil the Gadbury name.

1:09:53.272 --> 1:09:56.942
You're an idiot but
you're my fat idiot.

1:09:58.986 --> 1:09:59.820
- Papa.

1:10:00.154 --> 1:10:02.907
- My final order of business,

1:10:02.948 --> 1:10:06.952
get that maid's daughter off
the premises immediately.

1:10:08.287 --> 1:10:12.958
The Gadbury's get blackmailed
by no one, no one.

1:10:13.125 --> 1:10:15.794
We do the blackmailing
around here

1:10:15.794 --> 1:10:17.796
and don't you ever forget it.

1:10:22.675 --> 1:10:24.678
- I miss you so much.

1:10:37.483 --> 1:10:40.110
(upbeat music)

1:10:46.492 --> 1:10:47.743
- This is ridiculous.

1:10:47.743 --> 1:10:50.162
I demand to return
to my house now.

1:10:50.537 --> 1:10:52.539
- Not so fast, little sis.

1:10:52.539 --> 1:10:54.375
- What is that supposed to mean?

1:10:55.834 --> 1:10:57.253
- As of five minutes ago,

1:10:57.253 --> 1:11:01.173
Gordon is officially sole
heir of the Gadbury throne.

1:11:01.173 --> 1:11:06.428
This includes his $125.8
million and all other assets.

1:11:06.428 --> 1:11:08.889
- Oh, Gordo, you are rich.

1:11:09.139 --> 1:11:10.266
You better share.

1:11:11.517 --> 1:11:13.102
- You speak English?

1:11:13.769 --> 1:11:14.812
- Yeah.

1:11:14.812 --> 1:11:16.438
- What about me?

1:11:17.356 --> 1:11:19.900
- I regret to inform you your
father left you with nothing.

1:11:19.900 --> 1:11:20.693
- You broke.

1:11:20.693 --> 1:11:21.986
(laughing)

1:11:22.861 --> 1:11:24.154
- What?

1:11:24.237 --> 1:11:26.282
(speaking in foreign language)

1:11:26.532 --> 1:11:27.825
- So she broke?

1:11:27.825 --> 1:11:29.827
- And what are you
gonna do about it?

1:11:33.621 --> 1:11:36.959
(speaking in foreign language)

1:11:37.543 --> 1:11:39.545

That big bitch.

1:12:20.878 --> 1:12:22.963
I will have my revenge.
