WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:02.168
Previously on Rosewood...

00:02.252 --> 00:04.295
I ran the additional tests you asked for.

00:04.379 --> 00:06.214
-Do you have family?
-Yes, but they don't know I'm here.

00:06.297 --> 00:08.216
-You're gonna need them.
-The next battle you fight

00:08.299 --> 00:10.885
will not be one that you can handle alone.

00:10.969 --> 00:11.970
You know about my dialysis?

00:12.053 --> 00:13.596
I'm not gonna risk your life
to save my own.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.765
You need a kidney
or you're not gonna make it.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.934
Slade told me you turned down his kidney.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.979
Why do I get the feeling that I'm not
the only guy you're worried about tonight.

00:21.062 --> 00:23.023
When exactly did your last tour end?

00:23.106 --> 00:24.482
I told you, I got back this morning.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.317
Your luggage didn't have any tags.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.777
Is this an interrogation, sis?

00:27.861 --> 00:29.362
Only if you're hiding something.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.420
Hello.

00:45.670 --> 00:47.005
Yes, I promise, I'm almost there.

00:47.672 --> 00:49.215
Don't worry, just stay where you are.

01:01.603 --> 01:02.729
What are you doing?

01:09.194 --> 01:11.071
911,
what is your emergency?

01:19.913 --> 01:21.039
It's open.

01:22.791 --> 01:23.666
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:23.750 --> 01:27.378
Woman comes home from vacation,
finds a body in her mansion.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.047
Well, good morning to you, Villa.

01:29.130 --> 01:32.217
I'm six minutes early
which means I finally get a chance

01:32.300 --> 01:33.635
to meet your brother Marcos.

01:33.718 --> 01:36.471
Oh, he's not here. He went for a run.

01:36.679 --> 01:38.640
Okay, so you wanna clear me out
before he gets back, huh?

01:38.723 --> 01:40.350
Look, he still needs time to adjust.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.978
And even if he were ready to socialize,
you're too perky.

01:44.062 --> 01:48.399
Oh, I think the word you're looking for
is dynamic, maybe exuberant, vigorous--

01:48.650 --> 01:52.195
Hey, Marcos, we were just leaving.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.947
It's okay. At least I knew you had company

01:54.030 --> 01:56.658
because of that magnificent
piece of machinery in the driveway.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.743
See, that's a man
with some excellent taste.

01:58.827 --> 02:01.204
I'm Rosie, I'm the owner
of that magnificent car.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.288
I work with your sister.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.624
Rosie, this is the second time
I'm seeing your face today, man.

02:04.707 --> 02:06.459
-Yeah?
-Ran by your billboard this morning.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.504
Well, you know the one that's closest to
here is the one off the Venetian causeway.

02:09.587 --> 02:10.421
Yeah, I love that place.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.507
Like 360 degree views from the bridges.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.175
-So you like to run?
-About six miles a day.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.593
You see, I run four.
Man, you put me to shame.

02:15.677 --> 02:19.055
Well, you gotta build up to it, you know.
It's just four miles, then five miles--

02:19.139 --> 02:22.600
I hate to break this up but we have to go.

02:22.684 --> 02:26.813
Oh, by the way, Mom called me.
She's on her way from the airport.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.482
She cut her trip short
the minute she found out that you're back.

02:29.566 --> 02:30.441
She can't wait to see you.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.068
Yeah, I can't wait to see her either.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.195
- But I've got a job interview though.
- Oh, you do?

02:35.029 --> 02:37.282
I gotta be there in an hour,
so I'll catch Ma this afternoon.

02:37.365 --> 02:39.033
-Nice to meet you, man.
-Nice meeting you.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.703
Marcos, finally met him.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.881
You know, Marcos was great with you.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.549
You mean, I was great with him.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.676
I've a way with the Villas.

02:56.759 --> 03:00.263
He was friendly, he was chatty,
he's really making an effort.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.723
Except for the part
where he's avoiding your mother.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.516
-Right there.
-You picked up on that, too.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.893
As soon as you mentioned Daisy,

03:04.976 --> 03:07.562
his eyes started blinking faster
than a hummingbird's wings.

03:07.645 --> 03:09.272
Did you just say a hummingbird's wings?

03:09.355 --> 03:10.440
I mean, come on.

03:10.523 --> 03:14.402
Kidneys maybe failing me
but my eyesight and my similes, 20/20.

03:14.944 --> 03:18.615
It's just, you know, we had a conversation
about being a family again

03:18.698 --> 03:20.658
and he seemed to be on-board.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.076
-Pep talk, can I hear it?
-No.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.924
She looks like she's sleeping.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.175
There's no give.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.679
At -10 degrees, it'd take about 24 hours
for a body to freeze solid.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.766
The safety button malfunctioned.
We found ice in the mechanism.

03:44.849 --> 03:46.267
It's not common, but it can happen.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.353
You see this is an accident.

03:48.436 --> 03:51.940
The victim comes inside the freezer, but
the button jams and she can't get out.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.358
She dies of hypothermia?

03:53.441 --> 03:55.652
I'm not so sure.
Look at her hands and her fingers.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.446
No broken nails,
no bruises or lacerations.

03:58.529 --> 04:01.241
If she'd been conscious
she would've made a violent attempt

04:01.324 --> 04:02.533
to get out this door.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.328
'Cause she was either dead
or incapacitated, then moved in here.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.874
Here, Roseman. Sorry, it took me
so long to get here.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.167
Blue Thunder is a thing of beauty

04:11.251 --> 04:14.045
but it's getting harder and harder
to park that big girl.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.922
She hates it
when I call her that.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.716
-What do we got?
-Well, don't get too comfortable.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.635
I need you to transport
this body back to Magic City.

04:20.718 --> 04:21.636
Why can't the coroner do it?

04:21.719 --> 04:24.138
Because once it's thawed
the body would decompose quickly,

04:24.305 --> 04:25.890
taking any potential evidence with it,

04:25.974 --> 04:27.225
that's why Blue Thunder
will keep her frozen.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.685
What's with the costume?

04:28.893 --> 04:31.562
Costume? Mitchie, she's wearing
a formal dress.

04:31.646 --> 04:34.607
No, she's in a jeweled gown
of silver and gold.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.401
And she's also wearing glass slippers.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.113
Haven't you guys ever read Cendrillon.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.825
No? She's dressed like Cinderella, guys,

04:43.908 --> 04:46.536
the old school, original Cinderella.

04:46.619 --> 04:50.290
And she's also next to the pureed pumpkin.
But that could just be a coincidence.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.874
Right, Mitchie, come back to reality.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.377
Detective Villa, we found this
on the table on the foyer.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.630
Ooh, look at that.
I'm not gonna say I told you so.

04:57.714 --> 05:01.175
Because us Mendelsons have
historically great self-control.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.052
Well, you were right, so you can say it.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.638
You know what? I'm gonna talk
to the woman who found the body.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.849
I'm sure there's a sane answer
to all of this.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.814
Ashley was a waitress
with the company I own.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.065
Catering by Collins.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.359
-Why was she at your house?
-She was housesitting for me.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.153
I was supposed
to be out of town until Sunday

05:20.236 --> 05:23.531
but I came home a couple of hours ago
and found her dead in the freezer.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.367
I have experience with food, so I know
I shouldn't move her.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.329
I don't want to sound crass
but I didn't want to defrost the chicken.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.872
No, you did the right thing, Ms. Collins.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.374
Today's Friday, why are you home early
from your trip?

05:33.875 --> 05:36.753
There was a fire at my business
I needed to deal with.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.254
Maybe if I'd been home sooner...

05:38.338 --> 05:41.341
Do you know of any reason why
Ashley would be in such formal attire?

05:41.424 --> 05:44.093
My colleague seems to think
that she was dressed as Cinderella.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.554
She was dressed as Cinderella.

05:46.637 --> 05:49.724
Ashley was a children's character
entertainer. It was one of her other jobs.

05:49.807 --> 05:51.225
I'm sorry, a what?

05:51.309 --> 05:54.228
She dressed up as fictional princesses
to entertain at birthday parties.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.773
Glass slippers and a fancy dress,
it always equals Cinderella.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.068
I told you so.

06:04.947 --> 06:08.034
Ashley must've been going to
or coming from a job at a birthday party

06:08.117 --> 06:09.077
when she was killed.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.746
Either that or she's in a costume
'cause it's laundry day.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.456
Look, I need a cause of death ASAP.

06:13.539 --> 06:14.832
And if you say it was a poisoned apple--

06:14.916 --> 06:18.211
You'd be wrong because the poisoned apple
is from Snow White.

06:18.461 --> 06:21.172
Though unfortunately
it's gonna take at least 24 hours

06:21.255 --> 06:22.382
to prepare the body for autopsy.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.217
We can't cut into her
while she's rock solid

06:24.300 --> 06:27.512
and we can't swab because the frost
could interfere with results.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.764
Okay, so what can we do?

06:34.143 --> 06:35.103
We can thaw.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.409
Hey, Cap.

06:49.867 --> 06:53.037
Ira, what happened? I wasn't expecting
to see you for a couple of days.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.249
Daisy cut the cruise short
because Marcos is back.

06:56.332 --> 06:57.625
She hasn't seen him in over a year.

06:57.708 --> 07:00.086
Oh, yeah, I met him yesterday.
I stopped by to see Villa.

07:00.169 --> 07:03.047
He seems like a good kid. Respects
authority, but he isn't a door mat.

07:03.131 --> 07:06.134
Seems like I'm the only one who hasn't had
the pleasure of meeting the prodigal son.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.468
-Yeah, well...
-What's this?

07:07.718 --> 07:08.678
Hey.

07:09.303 --> 07:11.139
Just getting my finances in order.

07:11.222 --> 07:13.516
Trying to figure out what to do with
all the money my old man left me.

07:13.599 --> 07:16.352
Precaution, in case something happens
during the kidney transplant.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.813
I thought Rosie put the kibosh
on you being a donor.

07:18.896 --> 07:21.441
Rosie needs a kidney, I'm a match,
so he's gonna get my kidney.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.525
End of story.

07:22.608 --> 07:23.943
What, you're gonna force him?

07:24.026 --> 07:25.528
Like, you know, wake up
in a tub full of ice

07:25.611 --> 07:27.655
but he's not missing a kidney,
he has a new one?

07:29.615 --> 07:33.828
You know, since you're done vacationing,
here, why don't you get back to work.

07:33.911 --> 07:36.956
Get caught up on Villa's latest case.
She's about to talk to the family now.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.250
We're very sorry for your loss.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.212
My sister and brother-in-law died,
when Ashley was nine.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.798
I took her in, raised her like a daughter.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.259
She just wanted to help people,
especially children,

07:48.342 --> 07:51.512
because so many people helped her
after her parents died.

07:51.762 --> 07:54.098
That's why she was studying
Early Childhood Education.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.100
So she could be
an elementary school teacher.

07:56.184 --> 08:00.480
Well, she was housesitting, waitressing,
and princessing to pay for school?

08:00.563 --> 08:03.983
She was also a babysitter,
a dog-walker, a tutor even.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.277
I once got her a job
at the nursery where I work.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.029
She lasted a total of two days.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.032
Yes, she did not have a green thumb.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.992
Is this Miss Collins' fault?

08:13.075 --> 08:15.453
Did she not maintain the freezer properly?

08:15.536 --> 08:17.997
Actually this wasn't
an accident, Mrs. Benjamin.

08:18.915 --> 08:19.790
It's a homicide.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.502
It's likely Ashley knew
who her killer was.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.004
She was housesitting,
so her routine was disrupted

08:25.087 --> 08:26.756
and the murderer had to know
where she'd be.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.382
And there was no sign of forced entry.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.384
That's impossible.

08:30.635 --> 08:34.597
Ashley was the kindest,
most generous person.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.057
Who'd want to kill her?

08:36.140 --> 08:37.767
Well, that's what we're gonna find out.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.977
We're on our way to Ashley's place now.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.396
But I promise you we'll keep you updated.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.527
It just hit 11 am.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.070
Okay, Pip, raise the temperature
on the temp

08:49.153 --> 08:50.446
from two degrees to six degrees.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.949
You're sure you're okay in there, Mitchie?
You're turning kind of blue.

08:53.032 --> 08:56.536
Yeah, no, I'm good. Us Mendelsons have
an extremely high tolerance for cold.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.745
And ridicule.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.747
-What's the core body temperature?
-Negative two degrees.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.166
And the skin is two degrees.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.668
Her extremities will thaw out first

09:03.751 --> 09:05.753
so we should be able
to test her fingers and toes

09:05.836 --> 09:06.963
by late this afternoon.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.422
She looks so peaceful.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.509
Don't you usually have
more x-rays than that?

09:11.592 --> 09:13.177
Well, between the frozen state of her body

09:13.261 --> 09:15.680
and metallic interference
from all the beads on her dress,

09:15.763 --> 09:18.349
the other X-Rays are too clouded.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.268
I'm gonna start cutting her dress, guys.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.896
Boy, are you all right in there?
You're turning kind of blue.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.108
So her x-rays are clean.
No sign of head trauma.

09:27.191 --> 09:30.319
Personally, I don't get
the whole girl's princess obsession thing.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.322
Waiting around from slow-ass prince
to save them. Uh, no, thanks.

09:33.531 --> 09:36.867
As I recall, my dear, you really wanted
a lot of that princess paraphernalia

09:36.951 --> 09:37.994
when you were younger.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.621
Dolls and posters, the books, movies...

09:40.705 --> 09:43.666
Yeah, I liked princesses
but not because I wanted to be one,

09:43.749 --> 09:45.084
because I wanted to be with one.

09:45.167 --> 09:48.004
They were cute and all their problems
could be solved with kisses.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.213
Found something.

09:51.007 --> 09:55.845
This was stuck between her dress
and her body.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.764
Oh, that is an unusually long hair.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.725
If we're lucky,
it'll belong to our killer.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.227
See if the root's attached,
if so, run DNA.

10:03.561 --> 10:04.562
Hey, Villa.

10:05.646 --> 10:06.772
On my way.

10:12.903 --> 10:13.738
Her parents?

10:14.155 --> 10:17.450
Yeah, that was the last photo Ashley took
with them before they died.

10:17.533 --> 10:18.909
Villa, come, take a look at these.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.830
Looks like everyone loved Ashley.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.749
Everyone under the age of eight.

10:24.832 --> 10:27.209
Did she not have any close friends
her own age?

10:27.293 --> 10:28.628
Like a boyfriend or anything?

10:28.711 --> 10:29.795
No, not really.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.882
Ashley was just always
more comfortable around kids.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.050
They really loved her.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.093
We're not gonna stop
until we find out what happened to her.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.178
Thank you.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.347
And thank you for letting me come
and take Shadow.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.396
Nothing in here points to a killer
or a motive.

10:55.237 --> 10:56.989
Ah, well, there's a motive. Glitter.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.700
Gets everywhere
and there's no cleaning it up.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.452
Hey, just got off the phone with

11:01.535 --> 11:03.537
Ashley's boss at Once Upon A Birthday--

11:03.621 --> 11:04.747
That's a great name for a company.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.999
He confirmed that Ashley had a job
the day she died.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.584
Apparently the client called to complain

11:08.668 --> 11:11.879
that Ashley got into a fight
with a coworker, a Leanne Forest.

11:11.962 --> 11:12.963
What were they fighting about?

11:13.047 --> 11:15.758
-Boss wasn't really sure.
-You have any idea where we can find her?

11:21.806 --> 11:22.723
Did you hear from Daisy?

11:22.807 --> 11:24.850
I thought I'd get the call
for the big reunion by now.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.978
You should, but it hasn't
happened yet. Marcos is avoiding my mom.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.523
-You're gonna give her a heads up?
-No, and neither are you.

11:30.606 --> 11:31.982
At least not until I figure out
what's going on.

11:34.068 --> 11:37.029
Okay, so which one of these ladies
is Leanne.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.198
Hundred bucks says that's her right there.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.282
You're a psychic now?

11:40.366 --> 11:41.367
No, I just got off the phone with Mitchie.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.954
He said the long blonde hair that we found
on the body was synthetic, from a wig.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.123
So I'm guessing
with that length and color...

11:47.206 --> 11:48.416
We're looking for Rapunzel.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.917
Leanne Forest?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.503
Rapunzel, she actually meant Rapunzel.

11:52.586 --> 11:55.339
Right, Rapunzel. Can we have
a word with you?

11:55.464 --> 11:59.969
Oh, but we were just about to sing a song
and that's my favorite thing to do.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.430
- If you could just wait one moment--
- Actually it can't wait.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.723
See that? That's real.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.392
I have a few questions about
where you were two days ago?

12:06.475 --> 12:08.060
Is Rapunzel in trouble?

12:08.144 --> 12:12.606
What? No, no. Rapunzel's about to help us
catch an evil villain.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.108
Ooh.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.526
-Yeah, I know, "Ooh."
-Okay, everyone.

12:15.609 --> 12:18.821
Let's be quiet as mice.

12:19.321 --> 12:23.909
I was locked away in the tower
two days ago like I always am.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.745
Dame Gothel never lets me out

12:25.828 --> 12:29.248
unless I'm to celebrate
a very special birthday like today.

12:29.331 --> 12:31.292
We're celebrating Princess Stephanie.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.626
Yay!

12:34.086 --> 12:36.172
If you can just give me a minute
to finish up.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.340
-You know what? Finish up.
-Thank you.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.926
Let's all go sing Happy Birthday.

12:41.010 --> 12:44.930
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

12:46.307 --> 12:50.644
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

12:53.230 --> 12:58.527
You fought with Ashley the day she died.
And we found your wig hair on her body.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.488
See our dilemma?

13:00.571 --> 13:03.282
So you think I killed her? That's crazy.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.242
I mean, I'm practically a princess.

13:05.326 --> 13:08.788
You're a college dropout,
up to her neck in student loan debt

13:08.871 --> 13:12.833
who spends her time playing dress up.
What was the fight about?

13:12.917 --> 13:14.210
Nothing.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.420
Nothing. It was dumb.

13:16.504 --> 13:20.424
Ugh, I was running late for a toy store
opening, so I asked her to cover for me.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.635
You know, say I was
in the bathroom or something.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.303
And she wouldn't do it.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.806
She was such a stickler for the rules.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.099
So I simply reminded her that she owed me

13:29.183 --> 13:30.392
after I'd covered for her before.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.311
Well, how did you cover for Ashley before?

13:32.394 --> 13:34.313
We were working a kid's birthday party

13:34.396 --> 13:37.399
and I caught her flirting
with one of the dads.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.027
You gotta be careful with them
because they can get touchy feely.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.738
Anyway, uh, then I saw her
take out her cellphone

13:42.822 --> 13:47.159
and give her number to the guy's daughter
which is so against company policy.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.744
But I did not report her.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.122
Sounds like Ashley wanted the kid
to pass her number to the dad.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.415
Mm hmm.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.627
You said Ashley
doesn't break the rules, so...

13:57.211 --> 13:58.838
Yeah, but that's my point.

13:58.921 --> 14:02.007
Ashley pretended to be
on some moral high ground

14:02.091 --> 14:05.719
but at the end of the day,
she was really just a gold-digger.

14:06.136 --> 14:08.180
Just for the record,
I never got touchy feely

14:08.264 --> 14:11.016
with any of the princesses
at my kids' birthday parties.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.101
I believe you.

14:12.184 --> 14:16.146
You know, uh, Slade is still planning
to donate his kidney to you.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.900
Thought I made myself clear
when I refused his offer.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.737
-I'd do the same thing.
-Thanks for understanding.

14:23.821 --> 14:27.116
No, I mean, if I was Slade,
and I could give you an organ,

14:27.199 --> 14:28.534
I wouldn't let you turn it down.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.452
You really need to rethink.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.037
Yeah, I appreciate the advice,

14:32.121 --> 14:35.708
but I'm not gonna let the people
that I care about risk their life for me.

14:36.709 --> 14:42.256
So if you and Ashley never came to blows,
why was your hair on her body?

14:42.339 --> 14:44.466
Florida is the costume
and theme park state.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.011
I can name 20 other Rapunzels
running around out there.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.846
That hair was not mine.

14:48.929 --> 14:52.016
Oh. What are you doing?

14:53.934 --> 14:55.269
I need a sample for proof.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.939
-Villa, I have news.
-I have news.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.024
Normally, I say, ladies first.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.109
But since my news is bad news,
I'm gonna get it out of the way.

15:02.192 --> 15:05.404
The hair found on Ashley did not match
the hair sample from Rapunzel's wig.

15:05.487 --> 15:06.739
Okay, forget about Rapunzel.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.241
Based on what Leanne said
about Ashley giving out her number,

15:09.325 --> 15:10.534
I got a copy of her phone records.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.953
Ashley called 911
the night before she died.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.204
Listen.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.915
911, what is your emergency?

15:17.333 --> 15:19.043
Hello, is someone there?

15:19.126 --> 15:21.128
Are you in trouble? Hello.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.177
911, what is your emergency?

15:29.470 --> 15:33.307
Hello, is someone there?
Are you in trouble? Hello.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.309
Hi, I dialed the wrong number.

15:35.392 --> 15:36.727
Was that a car door slamming?

15:36.810 --> 15:38.604
She was headed somewhere.
Somewhere that she didn't feel safe.

15:38.687 --> 15:39.563
Where did this call originate?

15:39.647 --> 15:43.317
Dispatch triangulated it to the 3900 block
off Sundance Road.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.110
Okay, Ashley got three phone calls

15:45.194 --> 15:47.529
from the same number just 15 minutes
before she called 911.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.449
And that number is registered
to a Dale Bartram.

15:50.532 --> 15:52.159
Anybody wanna guess where Dale lives?

15:52.242 --> 15:53.702
3900 block, Sundance Road.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.246
Bingo. And Dale has a record.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.582
Public intoxication
and neglect of a child.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.210
He was arrested after he passed out
outside a restaurant

16:01.293 --> 16:02.795
while with his eight year old
daughter, Tiffany.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.339
Leanne said that Ashley gave her number
to a child.

16:05.422 --> 16:06.674
What if Tiffany was that child?

16:06.757 --> 16:09.218
-She called Ashley--
-And said something that prompted Ashley

16:09.301 --> 16:10.302
-to call 911.
-Yeah.

16:10.386 --> 16:13.347
Maybe Dale graduated
from child neglect to child abuse

16:13.430 --> 16:15.432
and the kid confided in Ashley.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.976
She wasn't flirting at that party.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.770
She was monitoring Dale because she
thought he was hurting his kid.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.855
She confronted him
and that's what got her killed.

16:21.939 --> 16:26.235
Enough of the hypotheticals.
Get Dale in here now. I want real answers.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.319
Okay.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.120
-I know what you're gonna say.
-Apparently I need to say it again.

16:36.203 --> 16:38.455
Well, if it makes you feel better,
go ahead.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.417
It's not gonna make a difference.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.674
Oh. Looks like you're making progress.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.634
Only the extremities have thawed.

16:50.718 --> 16:54.054
That's why I've drawn blood
from the foot so I can run tox.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.140
And I am swabbing...

16:56.223 --> 16:59.101
Nasal cavity, fingers and toes
Fingers and toes

17:02.229 --> 17:04.523
Mom, you're hovering.

17:04.606 --> 17:08.110
-I'd say she's gandering.
-Observing.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.653
You may need me to get more involved

17:09.737 --> 17:12.281
while Beaumont is recovering
from his surgery.

17:12.364 --> 17:15.075
That is so not necessary.

17:20.581 --> 17:21.582
Um...

17:22.624 --> 17:23.876
Is that Villa's mom?

17:26.086 --> 17:30.507
Daisy, I'm Donna Rosewood.
It's a thrill to finally meet you.

17:30.591 --> 17:34.219
Oh my goodness. How nice to meet you too.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.016
Beautiful. Look at the skin. Perfecta.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.018
Well, now I really am thrilled
to meet you.

17:42.019 --> 17:45.522
Well, mira, I'm looking for Annalise
and she's not returning my calls.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.067
So my papi Hornstock said that
she was here with Rosie.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.819
I'm sorry, Beaumont and Annalise
aren't here.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.154
Oh.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.865
Okay.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.326
I'll let you get back to work.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.827
Would you like a cup of tea?

17:58.911 --> 18:02.122
I'm a very good listener and I know
a thing or two about difficult children.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.124
-I would love that. Thank you.
-Come.

18:05.542 --> 18:10.172
My Annalise, I think she's hiding
something from me.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.174
You know, mothers, we always know, right?

18:12.633 --> 18:16.095
And my guess is her brother
because he's been avoiding me.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.806
Ashley had capsaicin
in her nasal passages.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.182
What is capsaicin?

18:20.265 --> 18:22.267
-It's a--
-Well, that's the kick in chili peppers.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.145
I love chili peppers.

18:25.229 --> 18:28.190
She's right, but it only means one thing
when it's found in the nasal passages.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.274
Pepper spray.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.735
Are you saying that someone attacked
that poor girl with pepper spray?

18:31.819 --> 18:35.447
She also had traces of ultraviolet dye
around her cuticles.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.324
Sometimes pepper sprays
are laced with dye.

18:37.407 --> 18:40.619
You know what? You're right, because
Annalise bought me one of those things

18:40.702 --> 18:43.914
and it was mixed with this green stuff
and it would get all over my hands

18:43.997 --> 18:46.333
when I used it. It was a real pain
in the you know what.

18:46.416 --> 18:49.711
So if there was dye in the pepper spray
then Ashley probably got it on her hands

18:49.795 --> 18:50.838
when she sprayed someone.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.005
UV dye is invisible.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.924
The attacker probably has no idea
they're covered in it.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.135
And it doesn't come off easily.
I gotta tell Rosie.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.761
Pero this is exciting.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.055
Come.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.434
My mom knows something's up.
She won't stop calling.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.020
Shouldn't you just tell her that
Marcos is avoiding her?

19:07.521 --> 19:10.357
Shouldn't you tell your mother
that you're not taking Slade's kidney?

19:10.440 --> 19:11.525
I asked you first.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.361
No, I don't wanna hurt her.

19:14.444 --> 19:17.197
Look, you avoided Daisy for months
when you first moved back to Miami.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.366
-You guys moved past that.
-But this is different.

19:19.449 --> 19:23.745
You know, growing up,
Marcos and Ma were thick as thieves.

19:23.829 --> 19:27.040
She was always one of those
diva princesses,

19:27.124 --> 19:28.709
relying on a man to do things for her.

19:28.792 --> 19:32.004
And after Dad left,
Marcos let her rely on him.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.715
-Then why won't he see her?
-I don't know, Rosie.

19:34.798 --> 19:36.800
Let's just talk about something else.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.136
All right, all right, let's do that.

19:39.219 --> 19:42.181
Like, princesses. I mean, come on,
you never liked any of them?

19:42.264 --> 19:45.142
-Not one of them?
-Ooh, I liked Zena.

19:45.225 --> 19:48.145
-Oh, okay, the warrior princess.
-Yeah.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.898
Look, I've been surrounded by strong women
my entire life,

19:50.981 --> 19:52.733
but I still believe in chivalry.

19:52.816 --> 19:56.028
I still believe that you can always lend
a helping hand to a damsel in distress.

19:56.111 --> 19:59.865
See that's the thing.
Fairy tales set women up for failure.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.700
I mean, Prince Charming doesn't exist.

20:01.783 --> 20:06.788
It's not like every woman
can have their own Rosie.

20:07.581 --> 20:08.790
What?

20:08.874 --> 20:10.209
-Their own what?
-Whatever. You know what I mean.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.085
No, what did you mean?
I want to hear what you said.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.430
This is it.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.064
What's that for?

20:32.356 --> 20:33.482
Forensic smoking gun.

20:39.655 --> 20:43.450
Hey, I'm Detective Villa
and this is my associate Dr. Rosewood.

20:43.533 --> 20:46.161
We'd like to ask you a few questions
about Ashley Morrison.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.955
I don't think I know anybody by that name.

20:48.038 --> 20:50.290
You mind if we come inside? Thank you.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.004
Does this woman look familiar to you?

20:57.506 --> 20:58.548
Dale?

20:59.383 --> 21:00.384
What did you do now?

21:00.467 --> 21:03.428
We have a few questions about this woman.
Do you know her?

21:03.512 --> 21:05.639
Yeah, she worked a few parties
our daughter attended.

21:05.722 --> 21:07.432
-But we don't know her personally.
-Hmm.

21:10.519 --> 21:11.812
What the hell are you doing?

21:11.895 --> 21:13.814
You mind turning off
all of your lights please?

21:14.398 --> 21:16.108
Why?

21:16.191 --> 21:18.318
Rosie, this better be good.

21:18.402 --> 21:21.488
Did you know that ultraviolet dye
is added to pepper spray

21:21.571 --> 21:23.865
to aid police in identifying criminals?

21:23.949 --> 21:26.868
It can only be seen with a black light.

21:31.081 --> 21:33.959
So looks like you did know Ashley.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.044
Personally.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.550
You hurt your daughter, Dale.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.635
You threatened her, so she'll keep quiet.

21:43.719 --> 21:47.097
Ashley found out, she confronted you,
and when you attacked her,

21:47.180 --> 21:49.016
she defended herself with pepper spray.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.184
Later, you tracked her down,
and killed her.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.520
No, this is all a big misunderstanding.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.522
I would never hurt my daughter.

21:55.605 --> 21:58.775
I only lied about Ashley because I didn't
want my wife to know the truth.

21:58.942 --> 22:02.070
What, that you are a low life schmuck.
I think she already knows that.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.572
Why did Ashley come to your house?

22:03.655 --> 22:08.118
Tiffany, my daughter called her
and told her that I was hurting the nanny.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.536
You are not helping your case.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.163
I wasn't hurting anyone.

22:11.246 --> 22:16.501
Tiffany was confused. I think she saw me
smack the nanny on the ass a few times

22:16.585 --> 22:18.712
and she misunderstood the gesture.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.466
You're sleeping with the nanny?

22:23.508 --> 22:26.470
Ashley knocked on my door
and demanded to see Tiffany

22:26.553 --> 22:27.679
and our nanny Beth.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.848
I didn't recognize her
so I told her to get lost.

22:29.931 --> 22:32.309
She pepper sprayed me
and pushed her way inside.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.312
Beth explained to her what happened.

22:37.022 --> 22:40.734
Ashley got really embarrassed and left.
And I never saw her again.

22:41.234 --> 22:44.112
-You need an alibi, Dale.
-Yeah, well...

22:45.405 --> 22:46.823
I was with the nanny.

22:53.789 --> 22:57.042
Dale's alibi checked out,
so we cut him loose.

22:57.876 --> 23:00.462
Look, it's not exactly square one, Cap.

23:00.545 --> 23:04.466
We'll have another suspect soon.
Okay. Good night.

23:08.804 --> 23:12.599
Seriously, you're just gonna sneak out
with all your things?

23:12.682 --> 23:16.311
I just figured it'd be kind of cramped
with me and Ma staying at your--

23:16.395 --> 23:17.562
Stop. Just stop it.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.857
-You're avoiding Mom.
-No, I'm not.

23:20.941 --> 23:25.737
Yes, you are. You know it and I know it
and you're gonna tell me why.

23:35.872 --> 23:38.667
-You're home.
-I can't do this right now, Ma.

23:50.303 --> 23:51.888
Donna said he's gonna come around.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.933
Donna? Donna Rosewood?

23:55.016 --> 23:56.601
-Yeah.
-When did you two...

23:56.685 --> 24:01.898
We had drinks and she told me
that Rosie pushes her away too.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.358
Especially when it comes to his health.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.445
So I told her that he wasn't gonna
take that kidney from El Capitán.

24:06.528 --> 24:07.529
You told her?

24:07.612 --> 24:10.198
Mija, she needed to know.
This is life or death.

24:10.740 --> 24:16.246
And we both want our children
to be healthy...and safe.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.801
Mitchie, you taking an early shift now?

24:29.885 --> 24:33.013
Actually I went ahead and took
all the shifts.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.599
I've been checking
on the victim every hour

24:35.682 --> 24:38.518
and I can now report
that the body is fully thawed.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.729
Good. We need to
start the autopsy right away.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.732
The body will decompose twice as fast
now that it's thawed.

24:43.815 --> 24:46.693
That's exactly my thinking.
I prepped the body and Pippy's on her way.

24:48.820 --> 24:49.946
Mitchie, you okay?

24:51.865 --> 24:53.200
You're more subdued than usual.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.160
You know I was up all night.

24:55.243 --> 24:56.995
I've seen a sleep-deprived Mitchie.

24:57.078 --> 24:59.206
It's not that different
than the well-rested Mitchie.

25:02.959 --> 25:05.629
I read through the victim's file
last night to stay awake.

25:05.712 --> 25:09.049
I didn't realize she'd been orphaned at
such a young age and raised by her aunt.

25:10.425 --> 25:13.094
Reminded you of losing
your mother and father so young.

25:15.263 --> 25:17.432
Ashley and I share a very similar past.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.893
It just brought everything back up for me.

25:19.976 --> 25:21.561
I mean, she's with her parents now.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.772
I guess
that's a sliver of a silver lining.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.274
But she deserved
a happier ending than this.

25:27.234 --> 25:29.361
There's only one thing we can do
to give that to her.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.781
We have to find out who killed her, Rosie.

25:34.115 --> 25:35.659
And that's just what we're gonna do.

26:00.016 --> 26:03.270
Well, Rosie was right.
If Ashley died of hypothermia

26:03.353 --> 26:07.607
I would see dark brown lesions
on the mucosa of her stomach and I don't.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.859
So she must've been dead
before she was frozen, you guys.

26:09.943 --> 26:13.863
There's non-displaced fractures
on the left anterior lateral surfaces

26:13.947 --> 26:15.156
of ribs three through seven.

26:15.240 --> 26:19.077
-She sustained a blow from a blunt object.
-A blunt object with a rounded edge.

26:19.160 --> 26:23.415
Rib shears. See how the breaks start
on the anterior surfaces

26:23.498 --> 26:25.500
moves to the lateral surfaces
and back again.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.585
You see that?

26:33.091 --> 26:34.134
Oh, look at that.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.761
-Her left lung is collapsed.
-Yep.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.763
She suffered
from a traumatic pneumothorax.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.640
She would've suffocated
in less than ten minutes.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.309
Based on this fracture,
whatever hit her rib

26:42.392 --> 26:44.728
and collapsed her lung
weighed less than 20 pounds.

26:44.811 --> 26:47.355
It's also between 12
and 18 inches in diameter.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.607
-Could it be a statue?
-Could be.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.233
I need to get back to the crime scene.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.905
Spread out and shout
if you find something.

26:55.989 --> 26:56.990
Will do.

27:02.996 --> 27:05.665
Okay, so, spoiler alert.

27:06.249 --> 27:09.669
Your mother knows
that you canceled the transplant.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.047
Thank you for the heads up.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.591
I'll just call her and reassure her
that I'll be okay.

27:14.674 --> 27:19.262
Rosie, you're not gonna be okay.
What you're doing, it's crazy.

27:19.346 --> 27:22.265
Excuse me, but I think
you were supposed to have my back.

27:22.349 --> 27:24.851
Right, I mean, your exact words were
"I'm not worried, you're gonna be fine."

27:24.934 --> 27:31.232
I know, and I thought it'd be easier
to pretend than to talk about losing you.

27:31.608 --> 27:34.903
But I've learned that running from
the truth doesn't help anyone.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.126
Is that a bead?

27:50.543 --> 27:52.587
Stones like these were found
on the victim's dress.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.131
What are the odds
that the killer came in here,

27:55.215 --> 27:58.468
planning to use this ugly statue
to commit murder.

27:58.551 --> 28:01.054
-Unless something went wrong.
-And the killer had to improvise.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.435
Hey. Look, I don't like
seeing your mother upset

28:07.519 --> 28:10.355
so I think I'm gonna track down
your brother and have a conversation--

28:10.438 --> 28:14.651
Look, I appreciate
that you care about Ma, but just...

28:14.734 --> 28:16.653
Leave Marcos to me, okay?

28:16.736 --> 28:20.115
Hey, who's the man?
Rhetorical question, I know it's me.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.991
Okay, are you gonna share
or are you just gonna

28:22.075 --> 28:23.201
pat yourself on the back all day?

28:23.284 --> 28:26.579
All right. So I found the victim's
skin cells at the base of the statue.

28:26.663 --> 28:29.165
Also found traces of fresh nicotine
at the top of the statue

28:29.249 --> 28:31.126
where the killer held it
to use it as a weapon.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.962
Well, didn't you say the homeowner
Veronica smoked like a chimney?

28:34.045 --> 28:35.588
Yeah, but she was out of town at the time.

28:35.672 --> 28:38.591
The only reason why she came back early
is because of the fire at her office.

28:38.675 --> 28:41.344
What if she lied?
What if she never left town?

28:41.803 --> 28:43.680
Maybe she asked Ashley to house-sit

28:43.763 --> 28:45.849
because she knew she'd need
an air tight alibi.

28:48.059 --> 28:51.146
So we pulled this security footage
from the building across the street

28:51.229 --> 28:52.522
from Catering By Collins.

28:53.106 --> 28:54.524
That's a very large fire.

28:54.607 --> 28:57.652
I'm assuming whoever's responsible
avoided the security cameras.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.697
They didn't need to. They wore a disguise.
This is from the back of the building.

29:01.406 --> 29:02.741
Now wait for it.

29:06.369 --> 29:08.204
Veronica has the exact same tattoo.

29:08.288 --> 29:11.124
She pretended to go out of town
so she could set fire to her own business.

29:11.207 --> 29:13.084
She lied about committing one crime,

29:13.168 --> 29:15.503
it's a safe bet she lied
about committing another.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.889
Veronica Collins, Detective Ira Hornstock.

29:25.972 --> 29:28.433
Detective, I've already told the police
everything I know about Ashley

29:28.516 --> 29:30.268
and I was out of town, so I'm not sure--

29:30.351 --> 29:33.104
That is a nice tattoo.
I think I've seen it before.

29:33.980 --> 29:36.232
Yes. There you go.

29:36.316 --> 29:37.400
Would you look at that?

29:38.485 --> 29:39.819
Let's see her deny it now.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.947
You can't make me take something
I don't want.

29:43.031 --> 29:45.700
-Really? You wanna do this now?
-I do.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.535
Fine.

29:51.414 --> 29:55.710
The chances that you'll find another match
are slim to none.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.504
You can take a few days,
live in your little fantasy

29:57.587 --> 30:00.423
but the reality is, there's no easy way
to get a kidney.

30:01.549 --> 30:04.219
So for you not to die,
somebody else has to die.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.679
Or somebody has to donate. I'm donating.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.139
Got it?

30:10.099 --> 30:12.310
You know arson carries
a 30 year prison sentence.

30:12.560 --> 30:15.104
Arson? Why would I be here for arson?

30:15.188 --> 30:16.064
We checked your finances.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.900
Catering by Collins appears to be
in some serious trouble.

30:18.983 --> 30:20.568
Now, rather than declare bankruptcy,

30:20.652 --> 30:23.112
you staged a fire
to collect the insurance pay off.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.782
And I'm guessing Ashley knew about it.

30:26.199 --> 30:28.117
So you killed her to shut her up.

30:28.201 --> 30:31.538
I may be a lot of things, Detective,
but I'm not a murderer.

30:31.621 --> 30:33.581
Besides Ashley had no idea
that I was in debt.

30:33.665 --> 30:36.292
Just the other day, she came to me
for financial advice.

30:36.376 --> 30:39.379
She'd questions about her trust,
wanted to access the funds early.

30:39.462 --> 30:40.797
Tell me more about the trust.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.550
She couldn't access the money
until she was 25.

30:43.633 --> 30:45.385
And it was no small trust either.

30:45.468 --> 30:48.137
I asked for an investment,
she said she had plans for the money.

30:48.763 --> 30:50.431
Look, I didn't kill Ashley.

30:50.515 --> 30:53.476
I needed money and you can't get that
from a dead girl.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.979
Well, you don't have
to worry about money anymore.

30:56.062 --> 30:57.188
Not where you're going.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.400
Ashley was gonna turn 25 in seven months.

31:00.483 --> 31:02.110
What was so pressing
that she couldn't wait?

31:02.193 --> 31:05.071
Ashley died before that money
was disbursed.

31:05.613 --> 31:06.865
Who gets it now?

31:10.827 --> 31:14.372
We found out about Ashley's trust.
The one you failed to mention.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.167
It was never a secret.
I just didn't think about it.

31:18.251 --> 31:19.544
The lawyers handle the money.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.546
Well, you're about to
handle a lot of money

31:21.629 --> 31:23.756
because you're the secondary beneficiary
on the trust.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.551
Now that Ashley's dead,
it all goes to you.

31:26.634 --> 31:29.345
-You think I'd kill my niece for money?
-Absolutely.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.724
I didn't care about the money
and even if I did

31:32.807 --> 31:36.269
I didn't need to kill Ashley to get it.
She offered that to me months ago.

31:36.352 --> 31:37.520
I said no.

31:37.604 --> 31:39.814
Ashley was trying
to access her trust early for you?

31:40.189 --> 31:41.274
Why?

31:41.357 --> 31:44.861
She wanted to help me
pay my rising medical bills but I refused.

31:44.944 --> 31:49.365
Her parents left that money for...
For her future.

31:49.449 --> 31:50.950
Medical bills, you're sick?

31:52.744 --> 31:54.162
But no one knows with what.

31:54.245 --> 31:57.248
At first my doctors thought I had the flu,
now they think hyperthyroidism.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.292
But I'm not responding to medication.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.002
Excuse me, ma'am. I'm a doctor, ma'am.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.381
Look to your left, to your right.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.598
Rosie, you're planning on leaving us
all in suspense or what?

32:13.681 --> 32:15.141
I believe you, Paula,
and I think I might know

32:15.224 --> 32:16.267
what's wrong with you.

32:16.351 --> 32:17.560
In order to prove that,

32:17.644 --> 32:20.438
I need you to come back to Magic City Lab
so I can run some tests.

32:30.323 --> 32:31.199
Hey!

32:31.866 --> 32:36.287
-I'm looking for a Detective--
-Cop two? He's in the bedroom.

32:43.002 --> 32:44.337
Hornstock, I got your text.

32:44.420 --> 32:47.674
You see this? This is a picture of my kid.

32:49.467 --> 32:50.343
Who did this?

32:50.426 --> 32:52.428
You don't recognize
your brother's handiwork?

32:53.221 --> 32:54.639
-Marcos?
-That house jockey out there

32:54.722 --> 32:57.350
says Marcos has been living here for
four months.

32:58.017 --> 32:59.435
Met him on Craigslist.

32:59.519 --> 33:03.022
-He's got everybody.
-Oh, no, no, no, I'm so...

33:04.816 --> 33:08.778
I'm so... I'm sorry,
I-I don't know what to say.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.991
What the hell?
It's an invasion of privacy.

33:13.074 --> 33:14.826
You wanna talk about invasion of privacy?

33:14.909 --> 33:17.245
You're stalking everyone
your sister and mother know.

33:17.328 --> 33:19.288
My mother, my sister.
None of your business.

33:19.372 --> 33:21.541
Just 'cause you're playing house
don't make you family.

33:21.874 --> 33:23.793
You know
your real family fall apart, right, man?

33:23.876 --> 33:28.131
Okay, let's get something very clear.
I care about these two women, okay?

33:28.214 --> 33:31.092
And I'm gonna protect them
even if it's from one of their own.

33:31.175 --> 33:33.219
Okay, enough, enough.

33:35.471 --> 33:36.681
Handle this.

33:37.765 --> 33:39.851
-Look, Lise.
-Shut up. Shut up!

33:43.855 --> 33:46.399
You're stalking my friends?

33:47.275 --> 33:50.695
-My... My boyfriend?
-I'm not stalking anybody. Okay, I just...

33:52.447 --> 33:54.574
I have a hard time
talking to people, you know that?

33:55.074 --> 33:56.701
I thought it'd be easier, if I just...

33:57.118 --> 34:00.621
Look, I know it seems crazy but...

34:01.706 --> 34:03.916
You gotta understand
this is how my mind works, okay?

34:04.000 --> 34:05.710
I just wanted to get to know them.

34:05.793 --> 34:07.253
What more can I say?

34:09.505 --> 34:14.927
You're avoiding Mom,
you're keeping a secret place.

34:15.970 --> 34:18.431
You're doing recon on my friends.

34:20.099 --> 34:22.226
Is there anything else
you wanna drop on me?

34:23.186 --> 34:25.980
-It's complicated, sis.
-It's complicated.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.774
Is that all you have to say?

34:29.317 --> 34:32.695
No, I thought you might've been angry
because you had to grow up too fast

34:32.779 --> 34:37.408
after Dad left but it's...
It's clear to me you never grew up at all.

34:38.951 --> 34:39.952
You...

34:41.496 --> 34:43.790
You know, times have changed.

34:45.500 --> 34:49.629
Mom has changed and you're not even
giving it a chance.

34:52.465 --> 34:53.800
You're acting like Dad.

35:09.107 --> 35:13.194
-No, I'm feeling a little dizzy.
-I'll get you some water.

35:14.946 --> 35:18.157
I can't believe Ashley was still
trying to access her money for me.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.993
You gave her a family
when she thought she lost everything.

35:22.036 --> 35:24.122
There's no way she could ever
really repay you.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.374
So her giving you the money
for your treatment

35:26.457 --> 35:27.917
was her way of saying thank you.

35:28.543 --> 35:29.710
She loved you.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.588
It would've made her feel good to know
she was doing something for you.

35:32.672 --> 35:34.632
Sometimes you just have to
let people help.

35:34.715 --> 35:37.093
Sounds like someone
should take their own advice.

35:38.594 --> 35:41.472
Aah. All right.
It's what you suspected.

35:41.556 --> 35:44.433
The organic base strain
showed a high concentration of nicotine.

35:44.934 --> 35:47.186
Paula, you've been suffering
from nicotine poisoning.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.896
How did the doctors miss that?

35:48.980 --> 35:50.940
It's not something
the hospitals would test for.

35:51.023 --> 35:53.067
And it's certainly not something
they would suspect.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.735
No, I-I don't smoke.

35:54.819 --> 35:58.614
A concentration of nicotine this large
probably didn't come from cigarettes.

35:58.698 --> 36:00.491
Does Ashley have any other beneficiaries?

36:01.701 --> 36:04.579
What about you? Who inherits your money
if you die?

36:08.499 --> 36:10.626
Why? W-Why are you asking me?

36:11.085 --> 36:14.630
Because whoever killed Ashley
is trying to kill you.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.258
And I think we both know who that is.

36:29.061 --> 36:30.188
Huh.

36:30.521 --> 36:34.275
Looks like your kindness towards plants
doesn't translate to people.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.235
-Detective.
-Did you know that nicotine,

36:36.319 --> 36:39.822
the most addictive ingredient
in cigarettes is actually from a plant?

36:39.906 --> 36:42.491
That means it's deadly
but it's 100% natural.

36:42.575 --> 36:46.037
Perfect for an organic pesticide.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.623
Oh, but you didn't just use that
to kill bugs, did you?

36:48.956 --> 36:52.376
You slipped it into your mother's soup,
tea, little bit every day

36:52.460 --> 36:55.838
so that when she died, it looked like
she succumbed to a long illness.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.216
You murdered Ashley
so her trust would transfer to Paula.

36:58.299 --> 36:59.759
Then once
you finally killed your mother...

36:59.842 --> 37:01.385
All that money would go to you.

37:01.469 --> 37:04.555
-No, you don't understand, that's not--
-We didn't find your prints at the scene,

37:04.639 --> 37:09.518
but we did find nicotine. I suspect that
you wore these gardening gloves

37:09.602 --> 37:10.770
to commit the murder.

37:10.853 --> 37:13.272
I'm sure we'll find Ashley's DNA on these.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.441
How did it go down, Gretchen?

37:15.691 --> 37:18.778
You went over, you thought
you'd lure Ashley into the freezer

37:18.861 --> 37:21.697
trap her inside, make the whole thing
look like an accident.

37:21.948 --> 37:24.492
But she fought back,
so you had to improvise.

37:24.575 --> 37:28.329
So you grabbed that statue
and smashed it down on Ashley's chest.

37:28.412 --> 37:31.332
It takes a special kind of ugly
to do what you did.

37:32.291 --> 37:35.253
It wasn't just about the money. Okay?

37:35.336 --> 37:38.506
My mom loved Ashley more than
she ever loved me,

37:38.589 --> 37:40.174
her own biological daughter.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.969
Ashley was always overshadowing me.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.221
She was prettier than me.
She was nicer, she was richer.

37:45.304 --> 37:47.974
And my mom just doted on her all the time.

37:48.057 --> 37:50.977
Yes, Paula loved Ashley,
but that doesn't mean she didn't love you.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.187
You just chose to see it that way.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.939
-Get her out of here.
-Let's go.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.487
-Can you get this upstairs?
-Yeah.

38:02.363 --> 38:04.573
Paula is expected
to make a full recovery

38:04.657 --> 38:07.034
now that her daughter
isn't poisoning her anymore.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.578
This is why I hate money,
makes people do twisted things.

38:09.662 --> 38:12.456
-Yeah, like what Tawnya did to Rosie.
-No, it's not all that bad.

38:12.540 --> 38:15.835
I mean Paula's gonna use the money
from Ashley's trust to set up

38:15.918 --> 38:17.461
scholarships for future teachers.

38:17.545 --> 38:20.006
She's gonna make sure
some good comes from all of this.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.758
Good work on closing the case.
See you guys tomorrow.

38:22.842 --> 38:23.718
-See you, Cap.
-You know

38:23.801 --> 38:26.345
I have to go.
I invited Marcos over for dinner.

38:26.637 --> 38:27.513
Seriously?

38:28.264 --> 38:29.890
He's been sneaking around,
he's been lying--

38:29.974 --> 38:31.934
Hornstock, I have to try
to get through to him.

38:33.477 --> 38:36.230
I mean, who knows if he'll even show up.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.983
But I can't give up on him.

38:41.444 --> 38:42.445
I just got him back.

38:44.822 --> 38:45.990
Good luck.

38:56.292 --> 38:57.293
Do I look okay?

38:58.127 --> 39:01.922
Ma, you can never look okay.
You're too beautiful.

39:10.973 --> 39:13.642
-You came.
-I don't wanna be like Dad.

39:21.067 --> 39:21.901
Hi, Ma.

39:28.741 --> 39:31.952
You have to eat, my love.
Mira, I made some Arroz con pollo.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.288
Thanks, Ma, I haven't had
a home-cooked meal in forever.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.290
Well, now I can cook for you anytime.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.918
And I was thinking we can go to that cafe
that you love.

39:39.001 --> 39:40.294
You know the one
with the little sandwiches

39:40.378 --> 39:41.754
and the French fries in the middle.

39:41.837 --> 39:43.297
And we can do a little picnic.

39:43.672 --> 39:45.966
I'm in between jobs
just like you now, son.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.635
Yeah, that'd be great, Ma, thanks.

39:49.428 --> 39:52.181
What's the matter?
You're rubbing your eye.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.266
Yeah, so?

39:55.851 --> 39:59.688
So you always did that when you have
something to get off your chest.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.315
I'm just-- I'm fine. I'm hungry, okay?

40:04.318 --> 40:05.319
Nothing.

40:07.613 --> 40:09.240
I know you, Marquito.

40:09.865 --> 40:12.618
Even after all this time,
I can read you like a book.

40:14.703 --> 40:16.163
That's why you didn't wanna see me, huh?

40:16.247 --> 40:18.666
Because you know Mommy's the one
that's not gonna fall for your act.

40:21.585 --> 40:24.130
You can talk to us.
There's no judgment here.

40:24.213 --> 40:27.425
Marcos, what is it?

40:30.469 --> 40:31.846
I can't go back to the army.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.933
I messed up and they gave me a chance
to leave on my own

40:36.016 --> 40:37.601
without giving me
a dishonorable discharge.

40:37.685 --> 40:40.813
-What did you do?
-Mami, no judgment. Por favor.

40:43.023 --> 40:44.775
I've been in the army for seven years.

40:44.859 --> 40:47.069
I'm supposed to do what, now?
Get a desk job?

40:47.153 --> 40:49.155
I mean, sling drinks, fix cars?

40:50.364 --> 40:53.701
I didn't want to tell you, Ma, 'cause if
I told you it'd make it all too real

40:53.784 --> 40:55.744
-and I really--
-Stop, stop, stop, stop.

40:56.704 --> 40:57.538
No.

40:58.956 --> 41:03.544
You're home and you have your family and
we're gonna work this out together, okay.

41:04.503 --> 41:06.088
It's gonna be all right, papi.

41:07.381 --> 41:08.883
It's gonna be okay.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.443
This is a first.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.570
I thought we should talk.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.576
You know, Paula inspired me.

41:35.993 --> 41:39.163
I decided to use my father's money
to start a program for teenagers

41:39.246 --> 41:42.833
who age out of St. Mels. Something to give
them a head start in life.

41:43.042 --> 41:44.376
You know I'm not surprised.

41:44.460 --> 41:46.670
When you first came to EMPD
you could've cleaned house.

41:46.754 --> 41:50.132
You could've fired Hornstock,
you could've zoned in on Villa,

41:50.758 --> 41:51.634
but you didn't.

41:51.717 --> 41:54.470
That should've been my first clue
that you cared more than you let on.

41:55.721 --> 41:57.473
Then in that hostage situation,

41:57.556 --> 42:00.684
I watched you offer your life
in exchange for everyone else's.

42:02.311 --> 42:03.479
And you meant it.

42:03.771 --> 42:04.605
What's your point?

42:04.688 --> 42:07.066
My point is, you're an important
part of the family now.

42:07.149 --> 42:10.069
And I would never let a family member
risk their life to save my own.

42:11.028 --> 42:12.655
Especially when I did this to myself.

42:23.457 --> 42:27.086
Here's where you're wrong.
I'm not some shining knight.

42:28.629 --> 42:32.424
I got demons in spades,
but somehow being around you,

42:32.508 --> 42:36.053
around the family you created,
helps me keep them all at bay.

42:36.136 --> 42:38.764
And you don't want to see the person
I turn into three months from now

42:38.847 --> 42:40.140
if you're not around.

42:40.224 --> 42:43.143
I think we can agree
that we're each trying to save a life,

42:43.227 --> 42:46.772
but you are mistaken if you think
it's your life I'm trying to save.

43:07.042 --> 43:08.586
-What's this?
-It's dinner.

43:08.669 --> 43:10.671
If I'm gonna take your kidney,

43:10.754 --> 43:12.339
you gotta start taking better care of it.
