00:08.270 --> 00:09.800

00:12.540 --> 00:16.740

UNDER-THE-CUP TRICK?

00:16.750 --> 00:18.350
- UNDER THE CUP, WHERE'S IT AT?
- YEAH.

00:18.350 --> 00:20.080
THOSE ARE CLEAR SO I DON'T KNOW
HOW IT'S GONNA WORK.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.950
- JUST WATCH, OKAY?
- OKAY.

00:23.950 --> 00:25.820
OKAY, SO WHERE IS IT AT?
WHERE IS IT AT?

01:42.830 --> 01:44.970
WHO SPECIALIZES IN
EARLY SCOUTS.

01:44.970 --> 01:47.030
NOW, THIS ONE HAPPENS
TO BE A '72.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.100
THIS IS A '79.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.370
- 1979, BRO.
- OH.

01:49.370 --> 01:50.640
- IT'S A SCOUT II.
- SCOUT II.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.040
- OKAY.
- SECOND GENERATION.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.640
IT'S GOT A FEW DENTS AND DINGS

01:53.640 --> 01:55.380
AND MAYBE A PRETTY GOOD-SIZE
WHISKEY DENT IN THE BACK.

01:55.380 --> 01:56.710
IT'S A ONE-OWNER, COME ON.

01:56.710 --> 01:58.910
BUT IT IS A ONE-OWNER, HE SAYS,
AND IT'S GOT AC,

01:58.910 --> 02:02.180
AND IT'S GOT A V8 MOTOR
AND FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE AND...

02:02.180 --> 02:04.590
- TILT STEERING WHEEL.
- ...TILT STEERING WHEEL.

02:04.590 --> 02:06.850
WE ABSOLUTELY DON'T NEED
ANY OF THAT [BLEEP]

02:06.860 --> 02:09.860
'CAUSE IF WE BUY THIS CAR, IT'S
NOT GONNA HAVE ANY OF THAT.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.800
BRIAN'S BACK TO GO ALONG
WITH THIS BUY

02:17.800 --> 02:19.870
BECAUSE, WELL,
HE FOUND THIS GUY, MIKE.

02:19.870 --> 02:21.800
BRIAN FIGURED I MAY HAVE WANTED
TO GET IN ON A HOT TREND

02:21.800 --> 02:23.870
BEFORE IT OVERHEATS.

02:23.870 --> 02:26.740
THAT'S WHY I'M DRIVING
A 1979 SCOUT II.

02:26.740 --> 02:29.080
GAS MONKEY IS NOT IN
THE BUSINESS OF CHASING TRENDS.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.410
I'M THE GUY SETTING THEM.

02:31.410 --> 02:34.750
WELL, THIS IS A ONE-OWNER SCOUT,
CAME FROM FARMERSVILLE, TEXAS,

02:34.750 --> 02:36.480
ABOUT TWO HOURS AWAY.
- OKAY.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.550
TALKED THE WIDOW DOWN
A LITTLE BIT AND DROVE IT HOME,

02:39.560 --> 02:42.290
AND, YOU KNOW,
YOU CALLED ME UP.

02:42.290 --> 02:43.290
THAT'S COOL.

02:43.290 --> 02:44.820
SCOUTS ARE, YOU KNOW,

02:44.830 --> 02:47.290
THEY HOLD A SPECIAL PLACE
IN MY HEART, YOU KNOW?

02:47.300 --> 02:49.760
- RIGHT ON.
- THE MONEY'S REALLY GOOD.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.570
WELL, THAT'S WHAT HOLDS
A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART.

02:51.570 --> 02:54.100
I KNOW. RIGHT?

02:54.100 --> 02:56.240
Richard: MIKE'S FLIPPING SCOUTS
LIKE I WAS MODEL As

02:56.240 --> 02:58.240
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF GAS MONKEY.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.240
HE'S FIGURED OUT THERE'S
A REALLY RICH MARKET FOR THESE,

03:00.240 --> 03:02.110
AND IT'S JUST WAITING
TO BE MINED.

03:02.110 --> 03:06.180
I SOLD THREE OF THESE TO A GUY
LAST YEAR THAT LS SWAPPED THEM.

03:06.180 --> 03:08.720
THEY'RE SOLD ALREADY,
62 GRAND APIECE.

03:08.720 --> 03:09.920
60 GRAND?

03:09.920 --> 03:11.250
60 GRAND, MAN.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.790
I THINK I SAW, LIKE,
FOUR OR FIVE OF THESE AT SEMA.

03:12.790 --> 03:15.320
THEY ARE REALLY HOT RIGHT NOW,
BUT THEY'RE ALL LIFTED.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.720
THEY'RE ALL FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.460
THEY PULL THE TOPS OFF,
GO DRIVE THEM ON THE BEACH,

03:18.460 --> 03:20.060
PUT LS MOTORS IN THEM.

03:20.060 --> 03:21.660
THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

03:21.660 --> 03:22.860
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
TO THIS?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.330
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
SELL IT TO YOU

03:24.330 --> 03:25.530
IF YOU'RE GONNA...
- I DON'T KNOW.

03:25.530 --> 03:26.930
I JUST GOT A COUPLE OF STUPID
IDEAS, BUT...

03:26.940 --> 03:28.270
DON'T LET HIM FOOL YOU.
HE'S GOT MORE THAN A COUPLE.

03:28.270 --> 03:31.200
YEAH. [ LAUGHS ]

03:31.210 --> 03:33.410
IF YOU MISSED THE 1970s
FOUR-WHEELING CRAZE,

03:33.410 --> 03:35.280
HERE'S THE DEAL WITH SCOUTS.
[ HORN HONKS ]

03:35.280 --> 03:38.480
THE FIRST SCOUTS WERE BUILT IN
1961 TO COMPETE WITH THE JEEP.

03:38.480 --> 03:41.010
THEY WERE ALSO SOLD
AS THE OUTDOORSMAN'S VEHICLE,

03:41.020 --> 03:42.480
BUT HAD A TOUCH
OF STYLE AND COMFORT

03:42.480 --> 03:46.690
THAT MADE THE SCOUT SORT
OF THE FORERUNNER OF THE S.U.V.

03:46.690 --> 03:48.420
THE SCOUT II DEBUTED IN '71,

03:48.420 --> 03:50.620
AND THE BASIC SHEET METAL
DIDN'T CHANGE MUCH RIGHT UP

03:50.630 --> 03:55.230
UNTIL THE LAST ONE
CAME OFF THE LINE IN 1980.

03:55.230 --> 03:56.230
LOOK AT THIS.

03:56.230 --> 03:57.760
YOU GOT SCOUTS
ALREADY IN THE YARD.

03:57.770 --> 04:00.100
YOU ARE A SCOUT AFICIONADO,
IT LOOKS LIKE.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.500
ENTHUSIAST.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.170
- I CAN'T GET OUT.
- "DUKES OF HAZZARD," MAN.

04:03.170 --> 04:05.370
COME ON.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.640
DOOR HANDLE DON'T WORK.
THAT'S A NEGATIVE.

04:07.640 --> 04:11.110
- GET OUT.
- ALL RIGHT.

04:11.110 --> 04:14.780
SO THIS IS, WHAT, A 304
OR A 345, SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

04:14.780 --> 04:16.450
I'M GUESSING IT'S THE 345.

04:16.450 --> 04:17.720
IT'S BASICALLY AN ORPHAN ENGINE.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.050
THEY DON'T REALLY MAKE MUCH
AFTERMARKET PARTS

04:19.050 --> 04:21.790
FOR THESE THINGS,
SO IF YOU WANT TO HOP

04:21.790 --> 04:23.260
THIS THING UP,
YOU'RE KIND OF ON YOUR OWN.

04:23.260 --> 04:24.990
THIS IS A BOAT ANCHOR
RIGHT HERE.

04:24.990 --> 04:26.930
HONESTLY, YOU CAN'T LEAVE
THAT ENGINE IN IT.

04:26.930 --> 04:28.130
JUST TOSS IT, YEAH.

04:28.130 --> 04:29.400
THIS IS A PROBLEM.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.860
THE QUARTER PANEL
IS A LITTLE BENT, TOO.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.800
YOU CAN GET ALL THE PARTS
YOU NEED FOR THIS.

04:32.800 --> 04:33.930
THEY HAVE THEM.

04:33.940 --> 04:34.940
EVEN THOUGH THE ENGINE
HAS NO AFTERMARKET,

04:34.940 --> 04:36.400
REALLY, THE BODY PANELS DO.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.610
ONLY THING THEY DON'T HAVE
IS THE FRONT FENDERS.

04:38.610 --> 04:40.740
MAN, I DIDN'T THINK
HE CRAWLED UNDER THE...

04:40.740 --> 04:41.880
Richard:
IT'S GOT A COUPLE OF DENTS,

04:41.880 --> 04:43.740
BUT IT'S ONE OWNER,
VERY LITTLE RUST,

04:43.750 --> 04:46.080
SO IF I CAN GET
A GOOD SOLID TRUCK

04:46.080 --> 04:48.280
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE RUSTY
WHEN WE TAKE IT APART,

04:48.280 --> 04:49.620
THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

04:49.620 --> 04:50.950
- I LOVE THE INTERIOR.
- YEAH.

04:50.950 --> 04:52.150
IF THIS THING HAS ONE THING
GOING FOR IT,

04:52.150 --> 04:53.690
IT'S THE CURB APPEAL,
THE ORANGE PAINT,

04:53.690 --> 04:55.620
THE STRIPES, THE PLAID SEATS.

04:55.620 --> 04:56.820
IT'S PRETTY COOL.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.830
I'M PRETTY GOOD AT POKER
AND READING PEOPLE AND,

04:58.830 --> 05:01.890
YOU KNOW, I THINK THEY GOT
HEARTS IN THEIR EYES, YOU KNOW?

05:01.900 --> 05:03.900
LITTLE EMOJI.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.500
ALL RIGHT. HOW MUCH IS IT?

05:06.500 --> 05:08.640
- $15,900.
- LIKE, $15,000?

05:08.640 --> 05:10.500
- $15,900.
- OH, MAN.

05:10.510 --> 05:11.910
MAN,
I AM IN THE WRONG BUSINESS.

05:11.910 --> 05:14.510
THEY'VE REALLY WENT UP, RICHARD.
THEY'RE STILL GOING UP.

05:14.510 --> 05:16.380
HOW ABOUT $10,000?

05:16.380 --> 05:19.510
- NO.
- YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.850
- I MEAN, $11,000?
- I WANT TO SEE IT DONE.

05:21.850 --> 05:24.120
I MEAN, I'D LIKE
TO SELL IT TO YOU.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.720
COME UP A LITTLE BIT AND...

05:25.720 --> 05:30.660
I JUST CAME UP TO $11,000.

05:30.660 --> 05:31.930
HOW ABOUT $12,500?

05:31.930 --> 05:33.530
ALL RIGHT, MAN, $12,500.

05:33.530 --> 05:34.660
- $12,500, HUH?
- IT'S A DEAL.

05:34.660 --> 05:36.530
- WE'LL DO IT. RIGHT ON.
- ALL RIGHT, COOL.

05:36.530 --> 05:37.930
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU OWN A SCOUT.

05:37.930 --> 05:39.270
IT'LL BE THE FIRST ONE
I'VE EVER OWNED.

05:39.270 --> 05:42.200
- YOU GOT TO HAVE SOME MUSCLE.
- [ LAUGHS ]

05:42.200 --> 05:43.600
SO WE ENDED UP PAYING
$12,500 FOR IT,

05:43.610 --> 05:45.740
WHICH IS PROBABLY A LITTLE
MORE THAN I SHOULD HAVE,

05:45.740 --> 05:47.140
BUT IT'S THE TRUCK
I NEEDED AT THE TIME

05:47.140 --> 05:49.410
I NEEDED IT IN THE CITY
WHERE I LIVE.

05:49.410 --> 05:52.010
YEAH, LET'S GO IN THE HOUSE
AND DO A LITTLE PAPERWORK.

05:52.010 --> 05:53.280
I THINK I'VE GOT $12,500
IN MY POCKET.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.480
Brian: I REALLY THINK THAT
IT'S GONNA BE HARD

05:54.480 --> 05:56.150
TO BREAK NEW GROUND WITH IT,

05:56.150 --> 05:58.350
BUT I'M INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT
RICHARD'S IDEAS ARE ON THAT.

05:58.350 --> 06:00.220
I'M THINKING MAYBE SOMETHING
ALONG THE LINES OF

06:00.220 --> 06:02.960

- OH, HEY.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.360

THAT I DIG ABOUT IT.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.320
- I DIG THE ORANGE.
- ORANGE YOU GLAD IT WAS RUNNING?

06:31.320 --> 06:33.350

I'M NOT GONNA PAINT IT BLACK?

06:33.360 --> 06:34.590
IT DIDN'T SOUND VERY GOOD.

06:34.590 --> 06:36.720

HERE IS MY THINKING.

06:55.010 --> 06:57.010
THIS, TO ME, IS MORE
OF A CRUISER, YOU KNOW?

SO WE GOT A HELLCAT MOTOR.

THAT THE DODGE HELLCAT

WITH A 6.2-LITER

MOST OF ANY MUSCLE CAR EVER.

IS THAT NOBODY'S PUT

AN ACTUAL
HELLCAT MOTOR IN A SCOUT,

07:18.830 --> 07:21.500

WHAT I'M FIXING TO DO HERE.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.610
I LIKE THE STRIPES,
AND I LIKE THE ORANGE,

08:06.620 --> 08:08.150
AND I LIKE THE PLAID INTERIOR.
- I DO, TOO.

08:08.150 --> 08:09.550
YOU WOULD WEAR STRIPES
AND PLAID TOGETHER.

08:09.550 --> 08:11.420
- I DO LIKE THE PLAID.
- YES, PLAID STAYS.

08:11.420 --> 08:14.090
MIKE! YOU'RE GONNA GET TO PAINT
SOMETHING ORANGE,

08:14.090 --> 08:15.760
NOT BLACK OR GREEN.
- WELL, I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.690
I WANT TO HAVE WHAT I'M GOING
TO HAVE THE SCOUT II HELL

08:19.690 --> 08:20.890
BECAUSE IT'S A SCOUT II.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.160
WE HADN'T PAINTED
A LOT OF ORANGE,

08:22.160 --> 08:23.960
SO I'M FOR SURE DOWN
TO PAINT ORANGE.

08:23.970 --> 08:26.170
YOU WANT US... DO YOU WANT
TO KEEP THE STRIPE PACKAGE?

08:26.170 --> 08:28.170
I WANT IT TO, AT A GLANCE,
EVERYBODY GO, "HOLY [BLEEP]!

08:28.170 --> 08:30.440
THAT'S, LIKE, A 1970 SCOUT,"
AND THEN LIKE,

08:30.440 --> 08:31.910
"WHAT IN THE HELL
DID THEY DO TO IT?"

08:31.910 --> 08:34.710
LOW CRUISER, GOT IT,
BUT SUPERFAST.

08:34.710 --> 08:35.780
YES.

08:35.780 --> 08:36.710
- GOT IT.
- LOT OF ATTITUDE.

08:36.710 --> 08:38.310
SO HOW MUCH TIME YOU GIVING US?

08:38.310 --> 08:39.310
CAN WE DO IT IN THREE WEEKS?

08:39.310 --> 08:40.910
OOH. YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:40.920 --> 08:42.720
I LIKE THAT THIS THING DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE IT'S HIDING ANYTHING.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.650
DON'T LOOK AT THE BACK CORNER.
DON'T COME BACK HERE AT ALL.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.050
THAT'LL BUFF OUT.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.190
YOU GONNA LEAVE THE ROOF RACK?
I THINK YOU LEAVE THE ROOF RACK.

08:49.190 --> 08:50.460
NO, WE'RE NOT LEAVING
THE ROOF RACK.

08:50.460 --> 08:54.590
WE'RE GONNA SMOOTH
THAT DOWN AND PAINT IT.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.730
HERE'S THE PLAN
FOR TURNING THIS 1979

08:56.730 --> 08:59.530
SCOUT II INTO
THE SCOUT II HELL.

08:59.530 --> 09:02.000
EVERYONE HAS SEEN THESE LIFTED
AND ROLLING ON BIG WHEELS,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
BUT WHAT'S THE MARKET
FOR ANOTHER ROCK CRAWLER?

09:04.010 --> 09:05.940
WE'RE GONNA GAS MONKEY
THIS ONE UP.

09:05.940 --> 09:08.070
WHEN THEY GO HIGH,
WE'RE GOING LOW TO SLAM THIS

09:08.080 --> 09:09.480
SCOUT TO THE GROUND.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.280
OF COURSE, THAT MEANS LOSING
THE FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE

09:11.280 --> 09:12.550
AND GOING WITH
ALL-NEW SUSPENSION

09:12.550 --> 09:14.810
AND A FORDLINK IN THE BACK.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.950
UP FRONT, WE'LL LOSE THE OLD V8
AND PACK IN A 707-HORSEPOWER

09:17.950 --> 09:19.620
HELLCRATE MOTOR.

09:19.620 --> 09:22.220
INSIDE, I'M LOSING THE BACK
SEATS BUT KEEPING THE PLAID.

09:22.220 --> 09:24.020
I MEAN, WHY NOT?

09:24.030 --> 09:26.430
AND OUTSIDE, JUST TO KEEP
THE WHAT-THE-HELL FACTOR,

09:26.430 --> 09:27.960
MIKE WILL LAY DOWN
A FRESH COAT OF ORANGE

09:27.960 --> 09:29.830
AND A NEW STRIPE PACKAGE.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.500
I WANT IT FAST.
I WANT IT LOW, BUT CRUISEABLE,

09:32.500 --> 09:33.970
AND I WANT IT DONE IN
THREE WEEKS,

09:33.970 --> 09:35.300
BUT I'M NOT HOLDING BACK
ON THE BUDGET

09:35.300 --> 09:38.640
BECAUSE THE GUYS ARE GETTING
75 GRAND TO GET IT DONE.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.310
THAT'S A TRUCK I COULD SELL FOR
MAYBE TWICE WHAT I PUT INTO IT.

09:41.310 --> 09:43.910
DAMN, I LIKE THAT.

09:43.910 --> 09:45.780
- BACK SEAT GOES AWAY.
- YEAH, THIS IS A TWO-SEAT.

09:45.780 --> 09:46.980
I LIKE WHERE YOUR HEAD IS AT,
JASON.

09:46.980 --> 09:48.720
AC COMES OUT
BECAUSE WE WANT POWER.

09:48.720 --> 09:49.980
THAT'S JUST TAKING AWAY
FROM THE POWER.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.650
- YOU JUST GIVE US THE CHECKBOOK.
- YEAH, WE GOT THIS.

09:51.650 --> 09:54.190
I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
75 GRAND AND THREE WEEKS.

09:54.190 --> 09:56.320
WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT INSIDE,
AND WE'RE GONNA GET STARTED.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.860
- ALL RIGHT?
- CAN YOU SAVE THE SEAT FABRIC?

09:57.860 --> 09:59.330
- I LIKE IT.
- RICHARD NEEDS NEW SOCKS.

09:59.330 --> 10:00.590
Richard: MAYBE YOU SHOULD START
PAYING ATTENTION

10:00.600 --> 10:02.200
TO WHAT WE DO AROUND HERE,
RUSSELL.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.060
AS LONG AS IT MAKES MONEY,
THAT'S GREAT,

10:04.070 --> 10:06.130
BUT TO BE ABLE TO GET IT
FROM THE HUNK OF JUNK

10:06.130 --> 10:08.270
THAT'S SITTING THERE NOW
TO THE HUNK OF JUNK

10:08.270 --> 10:11.340
IT'S GONNA BE AFTER
THREE WEEKS AND 75 GRAND,

10:11.340 --> 10:13.740
I GUESS RICH WILL HAVE TO PROVE
MY WRONG ON THIS ONE.

10:13.740 --> 10:16.210
WE BUILD, AND THEN WE SELL.

10:16.210 --> 10:18.810
OH. IT'S ORANGE.

10:18.810 --> 10:20.550
IT LOOKS LIKE A SAFETY CONE
ON WHEELS.

10:26.890 --> 10:28.290
WHOO!

10:28.290 --> 10:30.090
Narrator:
COMING UP ON "FAST N' LOUD"...

10:30.090 --> 10:31.560
WHY DO WE ALWAYS GET CRAP?
LOOK AT THAT.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.430
Narrator:
...RUST MIGHT BUST THE BUILD.

10:33.430 --> 10:34.690
THIS THING'S UNREAL.

10:34.700 --> 10:35.760
- AND...
- WHOO!

10:35.760 --> 10:37.030
- GET IT.
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO GET IT.

10:37.030 --> 10:39.170
Narrator: ...RICHARD GOES AFTER
A GAS MONKEY ICON.

10:39.170 --> 10:40.230
WHERE'S THE F40?

10:40.240 --> 10:42.970
THIS IS WHAT WE CAME FOR, B.

10:42.970 --> 10:45.140
[ LAUGHS ]

10:56.420 --> 10:59.320
WE REALLY SHOULD PUT A PLOW
ON THIS THING.

10:59.320 --> 11:02.190
THAT'S GOOD.

11:02.190 --> 11:04.060
WE NEED TO FIX THIS DOOR HANDLE.

11:04.060 --> 11:05.260
WELL, THAT'S ONE ON THE LIST.

11:05.260 --> 11:06.530
- YEAH.
- THIS ISN'T PERFECT.

11:06.530 --> 11:08.330
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
- WHY DO WE ALWAYS GET CRAP?

11:08.330 --> 11:09.600
LOOK, AT THE END OF THE DAY,

11:09.600 --> 11:11.730
EVERY ONE OF OUR VEHICLES,
THEY ALWAYS SELL.

11:11.730 --> 11:15.800
THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS MAKE MONEY,
BUT THEY ALWAYS SELL.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.540
TODAY WE TEAR DOWN
THE '79 SCOUT.

11:17.540 --> 11:20.070
RICHARD GAVE US A BUDGET
OF 75 GRAND

11:20.080 --> 11:23.140
BUT ONLY THREE WEEKS
TO GET IT DONE.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.540
I KNOW I'M THE PAINT GUY
AND ALL,

11:24.550 --> 11:26.080
BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED
THAT THE HELLCRATE MOTOR

11:26.080 --> 11:27.680
THAT RICHARD WANTS TO PUT
IN THIS THING

11:27.680 --> 11:29.250
ISN'T GONNA SNAP IT IN HALF.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.550
WHAT WAS THE OVERALL PLAN?

11:30.550 --> 11:33.950
- BIG MOTOR, LOW, FAST.
- YEAH.

11:33.960 --> 11:38.960
MY VISION WENT TO THE SHART CAT
MEETS THE HI-PO HAULER.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.560
THE SHART CAT WAS
A '67 DODGE DART

11:40.560 --> 11:42.760
THAT WE DROPPED
A HELLCAT MOTOR INTO,

11:42.760 --> 11:44.300
AND IT WAS FAST AS HELL.

11:44.300 --> 11:48.700
[ ENGINE REVS ]

11:48.700 --> 11:50.170
THE HI-PO HAULER WE MADE
FOR HOT WHEELS

11:50.170 --> 11:53.370
AND WAS OUR TAKE
ON A '60s-ERA DRAGSTER.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.840
I THINK HE'S ALREADY AGAINST
THE WALL IF HE GAVE US

11:54.840 --> 11:56.310
75 GRAND TO SPEND ON A SCOUT.

11:56.310 --> 11:58.110
AND YOU GUYS HAVEN'T EVEN
TAKEN IT APART.

11:58.110 --> 12:00.050
LET'S DO IT.

12:00.050 --> 12:01.980
Russell: I MAY NOT KNOW CARS
LIKE THE MONKEYS,

12:01.980 --> 12:04.650
BUT I DO KNOW I GOT TO KEEP THIS
THING ON TIME AND ON BUDGET,

12:04.650 --> 12:06.650
SO I KIND OF GOT TO HELP OUT.

12:06.660 --> 12:07.990
WHEW!

12:07.990 --> 12:09.660
OH. LOOK AT THAT.

12:09.660 --> 12:12.060
- WE GOT SMOKERS?
- WHEE!

12:12.060 --> 12:13.860
AND STILL NOT RUSTED.
USUALLY THAT MEANS...

12:13.860 --> 12:15.200
FOUND ITS HOME.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.800
- THE LEAVES SAVED IT.
- YEAH, RIGHT?

12:16.800 --> 12:18.800
SOMETHING SAVED IT.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.930
EVER HEAR THE SAYING
THAT SCOUTS WERE BORN RUSTY?

12:20.940 --> 12:22.270
HERE'S WHY.

12:22.270 --> 12:24.070
INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER BROUGHT
ROLLS OF CHEAP STEEL

12:24.070 --> 12:25.340
AND LEFT IT OUT IN THE RAIN.

12:25.340 --> 12:27.010
WHAT DO YOU GET WHEN YOU
MIX WATER WITH STEEL?

12:27.010 --> 12:29.140
YOU GET RUST AND THAT SAME
RUSTY STEEL

12:29.140 --> 12:32.880
THEY USED TO BUILD NEW SCOUTS,
BORN RUSTY.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.780
USUALLY THAT HOLDS THE MOISTURE
AND MAKES A BIG RUST HOLE.

12:34.780 --> 12:35.820
A SPOT LIKE THAT?

12:35.820 --> 12:37.220
OH, USUALLY THAT POCKET
IS ALL RUSTED UP.

12:37.220 --> 12:38.890
YEAH, LOOK AT IT. IT'S GREAT.
THIS THING IS UNREAL.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.490
OH, SOMEBODY'S HOME.
YOU CAN TELL SO...

12:40.490 --> 12:41.690
OH, DUST DAUBERS.

12:41.690 --> 12:43.360
THESE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS
WE LIKE TO DISCOVER.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.690
[ TOOL WHIRRING ]

12:46.700 --> 12:47.830
EH, DON'T GET TOO HAPPY.

12:47.830 --> 12:51.100
THIS IS WHERE
THE PROBLEMS START.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.570
OOH, HERE WE GO.
THERE'S SOMETHING.

12:52.570 --> 12:53.830
OH, MAN. THAT SUCKS.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.300
I FEEL LIKE THE BACK WINDOW
WAS OPEN OR SOMETHING

12:55.300 --> 12:58.170
AND IT GOT WET BACK HERE BECAUSE
THIS IS REALLY NOT TYPICAL.

12:58.170 --> 12:59.310
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

12:59.310 --> 13:00.510
LIKE, THIS SOAKED UP SOME WATER
OR SOMETHING.

13:00.510 --> 13:03.580
- HERE'S THE THING, THOUGH.
- YEAH.

13:03.580 --> 13:05.380
NOT MY JOB. I DON'T CARE.

13:05.380 --> 13:07.450
YOU WANT TO PULL THE BODY
FIRST AND THEN THE MOTOR?

13:07.450 --> 13:08.580
YEAH.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.950
THIS FRAME IS ACTUALLY
IN GREAT SHAPE.

13:09.950 --> 13:11.180
IF WE WEREN'T STRAPPING
A 700-PLUS-HORSEPOWER BEAST

13:11.190 --> 13:12.850
TO IT,
IT WOULD DO JUST FINE,

13:12.850 --> 13:14.190
BUT WE'LL
SAVE IT FOR ANOTHER BUILD.

CAN HANDLE THE HELLCRATE POWER.

TOOK IT FROM HIM.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.950

ALL OUT THERE ON THE LINE

FERRARI F40 FOR 400 GRAND

13:42.350 --> 13:50.350

THAN IT WAS NEW.

13:50.760 --> 13:51.960

WHEN HE SOLD IT FOR $590,000.

- HE'S FIXING TO LOSE 110 GRAND.
- YEP.

GO WHEN YOU STAND UP?"

THOUGH,

AS LONG AS YOU STAY CLEAN

BECAUSE WHEN IT GETS WEIRD IS
WHEN YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, [BLEEP]."

A CERTAIN THEME, TOO.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.390

EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE,

32:11.390 --> 32:12.860
BUT IF WE CAN STAY IN A THEME,

THEN IT STAYS COOL.

OF YOUR NOW-UNIBODY SCOUT?

THAT THEY GET WHERE I'M TRYING
TO GO WITH THE SCOUT BUILD.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.880
ALL RIGHT.
SO IF WE'RE UNIBODY NOW,

32:35.880 --> 32:37.880
WHAT DID WE PUT UNDER THIS,
OR IS THAT IT?

32:37.880 --> 32:39.020
- THAT'S IT.
- SO WE'RE...

39:33.570 --> 39:34.900
BECAUSE RICHARD PULLED
SOME STRINGS

39:34.900 --> 39:36.830
TO GET THE EIGHT-SPEED TRANNY.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.370
NOW WE CAN FINALLY MARRY
THE TWO TOGETHER

39:38.370 --> 39:41.640
AND DO A MOCK STUB
OF THE DRIVETRAIN.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.110
- LET'S DO THIS.
- GET YOU SOME OF THAT.

39:44.110 --> 39:45.980
THE HELLCRATE, IT'S A BIG DEAL.

39:45.980 --> 39:47.250
IS THIS THE END
THAT THIS POPS OUT?

39:47.250 --> 39:48.310
WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!

39:48.320 --> 39:49.580
- WE HAVE A MOTOR!
- DUDE.

39:49.580 --> 39:51.180
- THAT'S NICE.
- IT TOOK UP THE WHOLE CRATE.

39:51.180 --> 39:52.980
- LOT OF POWER.
- OH, MAN.

39:52.990 --> 39:54.920
THE HELLCRATE IS THE SAME MOTOR
AS THE HELLCAT,

39:54.920 --> 39:56.590
WHICH YOU'LL FIND
IN THE DODGE CHARGER.

39:56.590 --> 39:58.060
ONLY THING IS, THIS BABY
IS MEANT TO BE

39:58.060 --> 39:59.720
RETROFITTED INTO OTHER CARS.

39:59.730 --> 40:00.930
I'M WAITING ON A TRANS.

40:00.930 --> 40:02.660
TRANS GOT HERE THIS MORNING,
SO THAT'S HERE.

40:02.660 --> 40:03.990
- WHERE'S IT AT?
- SWEET.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.930
WELL, THEN I CAN BOLT THE MOTOR
AND TRANS TOGETHER,

40:05.930 --> 40:06.930
AND WHILE YOU GUYS ARE
FINISHING UP THE METALWORKING,

40:06.930 --> 40:08.070
YOU'RE FINISHING UP
YOUR BRACKETS,

40:08.070 --> 40:09.200
WE CAN DROP THAT THING IN.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.530
YEAH, DROP IT IN,
SEE IF IT CLEARS THE FLOOR.

40:10.540 --> 40:11.600
- THAT'D BE AWESOME.
- I'LL SET ALL THEM OUT HERE.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.140
YEAH.

40:13.140 --> 40:15.470
IT'S THE FIRST SUPERCHARGED
FACTORY-DIRECT 707-HORSEPOWER

40:15.480 --> 40:17.340
CRATE ENGINE KIT EVER SOLD.

40:17.340 --> 40:18.940
EVEN COOLER IS
WE'RE GONNA TO BE THE FIRST

40:18.950 --> 40:21.750
TO EVER PUT ONE INTO A SCOUT.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.150
THIS THING WEIGHS A TON.

40:23.150 --> 40:25.050
WE'RE USING AN EIGHT-SPEED
AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION

40:25.050 --> 40:27.020
FROM MOPAR.
IT COMES WITH A TORQUE CONVERTER

40:27.020 --> 40:29.090
FOR LIGHTNING-FAST SHIFTS
AND ACCELERATION.

40:29.090 --> 40:30.890
WE WANT TO DROP IN THE MOTOR
AND TRANSMISSION

40:30.890 --> 40:32.160
TO DO A MOCK-UP
OF HOW IT'S GONNA

40:32.160 --> 40:33.830
SIT INSIDE THE ENGINE BAY

40:33.830 --> 40:35.430
SO WE CAN SEE WHERE WE WANT
TO BUILD OUR MOTOR

40:35.430 --> 40:39.230
AND TRANSMISSION MOUNTS
BEFORE IT ALL GOES OFF TO PAINT.

40:39.230 --> 40:43.430
LOOKING AT THAT, PAN,
THIS CROSSMEMBER.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.900
YEAH, IS THAT MOTOR BACKWARDS
RIGHT NOW?

40:45.910 --> 40:48.770
- HEY, JASON.
- SIR.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.840
NOW THAT WE GOT THE MOTOR ON,
CAN REALLY LOOK AT IT,

40:50.840 --> 40:52.980
AND THE CROSSMEMBER THAT WE HAVE
WITH THE RACK AND PINION

40:52.980 --> 40:54.510
AND EVERYTHING...
- YEAH.

40:54.510 --> 40:57.250
THIS FRONT SUMP PAN
IS NOT GOING TO CLEAR.

40:57.250 --> 40:58.480
- YEAH.
- IT'S NOT GONNA CLEAR.

40:58.480 --> 40:59.380
IT'LL PUT OUR MOTOR
RIGHT THROUGH THE HOOD.

40:59.390 --> 41:00.720
OUR DRIVESHAFT WOULD BE
TOO HIGH.

41:00.720 --> 41:03.860
IT WOULD JUST CREATE
TOO MANY PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD.

41:03.860 --> 41:05.660
- THAT IS A PRETTY TALL SUMP.
- YEAH.

41:05.660 --> 41:07.590
WHAT IS IT, LIKE,
6 INCHES TALL?

41:07.590 --> 41:09.390
SO THAT DOES MAKE A LOT OF
DIFFERENCE ON A STEERING RACK.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.730
I DON'T THINK THIS IS
GONNA WORK, DUDE.

41:10.730 --> 41:11.930
WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE MOTOR
AND TRANSMISSION

41:11.930 --> 41:14.130
IN DAYS AGO, LIKE, DAYS AGO.

41:14.130 --> 41:15.800
WE'RE STARTING TO FEEL
THE STRESS A LITTLE BIT.

41:15.800 --> 41:17.670
IT'S GONNA STINK.

41:17.670 --> 41:19.740
Narrator:
NEXT WEEK ON "FAST N' LOUD"...

41:19.740 --> 41:21.140
YOU'RE LOSING YOUR ASS
BACK THERE.

41:21.140 --> 41:24.140
Narrator: THE MONKEYS RACE TO
FINISH THE SCOUT FROM HELL,

41:24.140 --> 41:27.080
BUT BEING THE FIRST TO PUT
A HELLCRATE ENGINE IN A SCOUT

41:27.080 --> 41:28.610
IS MORE THAN THEY BARGAINED FOR.

41:28.610 --> 41:30.280
ISN'T THIS WHAT
YOU PLANNED IT TO BE?

41:30.280 --> 41:31.720
I DON'T THINK I WANT
BLACK LEATHER.

41:31.720 --> 41:33.280
Narrator:
AND RICHARD'S INTERIOR DESIGN

41:33.290 --> 41:36.090
MIGHT TURN HEADS AND STOMACHS

41:36.090 --> 41:39.490
UNTIL RICHARD FINDS HIMSELF
DEALING WITH AN OLD NEMESIS.

41:39.490 --> 41:40.630
HEY, ASS MONKEY!

41:40.630 --> 41:42.290
YOU GOT TO COME UP
WITH A NEW CATCHPHRASE.

41:42.300 --> 41:45.160
Narrator: PLUS, RICHARD GOES TO
SEE DENNIS FOR A SHOPPING SPREE

41:45.170 --> 41:48.570
AND COMES HOME
WITH A 1963 SPLIT-WINDOW.

41:48.570 --> 41:49.900
Richard:
THIS IS A COOL-ASS CAR.

41:49.900 --> 41:52.240
Narrator: CAN THE MONKEYS
FULFILL RICHARD'S VISION,

41:52.240 --> 41:55.440
OR WILL HE END UP WITH
A SUPERPOWERED ORANGE CRATE?

41:55.440 --> 41:57.180
WE GOT A PROBLEM.

41:57.180 --> 41:58.310
THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
