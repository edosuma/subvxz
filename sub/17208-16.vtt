LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

00:01.168 --> 00:02.544
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

00:02.544 --> 00:04.505
<i>Let's start with our Jane.</i>

00:04.505 --> 00:05.965
<i>As a child, her grandmother</i>

00:05.965 --> 00:07.758
<i>taught her to protect</i>

00:05.965 --> 00:07.758
<i>her flower.</i>

00:07.758 --> 00:09.593
<i>And so Jane waited to have sex</i>

00:09.593 --> 00:11.386
<i>until she married Michael.</i>

00:11.386 --> 00:13.722
<i>And then, well, you know.</i>

00:13.722 --> 00:15.850
<i>Yeah. I still miss him, too.</i>

00:15.850 --> 00:17.893
<i>But it's been three years,</i>

00:15.850 --> 00:17.893
<i>and since then,</i>

00:17.893 --> 00:19.937
<i>Jane wrote a novel</i>

00:17.893 --> 00:19.937
<i>about their love story.</i>

00:19.937 --> 00:23.022
<i>And she recently decided</i>

00:19.937 --> 00:23.022
<i>she was ready to date again.</i>

00:23.022 --> 00:25.024
<i>Also ready to date? Alba.</i>

00:25.024 --> 00:27.736
<i>See, she was crushing</i>

00:25.024 --> 00:27.736
<i>on her coworker Jorge,</i>

00:27.736 --> 00:29.571
<i>and guess what?</i>

00:27.736 --> 00:29.571
<i>He asked her out!</i>

00:29.571 --> 00:32.449
<i>And as for Rafael, well,</i>

00:29.571 --> 00:32.449
<i>he'd recently gotten closer</i>

00:32.449 --> 00:34.284
<i>to his ex-wife Petra.</i>

00:34.284 --> 00:37.621
<i>In fact, he was downright</i>

00:34.284 --> 00:37.621
<i>into her, lately. Only problem,</i>

00:37.621 --> 00:40.624
<i>Petra was dating Chuck, the</i>

00:37.621 --> 00:40.624
<i>owner of the hotel next door.</i>

00:40.624 --> 00:42.793
<i>Plus, Petra had other problems.</i>

00:42.793 --> 00:44.753
<i>See, her former</i>

00:42.793 --> 00:44.753
<i>employee, Scott,</i>

00:44.753 --> 00:46.714
<i>died on the grounds</i>

00:44.753 --> 00:46.714
<i>of the Marbella.</i>

00:46.714 --> 00:49.675
<i>And Scott used to be married</i>

00:46.714 --> 00:49.675
<i>to her twin sister Anezka.</i>

00:49.675 --> 00:51.385
<i>But Anezka was long gone,</i>

00:51.385 --> 00:54.304
<i>and according to Petra,</i>

00:51.385 --> 00:54.304
<i>they were no longer in touch.</i>

00:54.304 --> 00:57.057
<i>But here's the thing--</i>

00:54.304 --> 00:57.057
<i>Petra was lying.</i>

00:57.057 --> 00:58.433
<i>And the cops were on to her.</i>

00:58.433 --> 00:59.935
<i>Oh, and speaking of crime,</i>

00:59.935 --> 01:02.563
<i>you'll recall</i>

00:59.935 --> 01:02.563
<i>Rafael's sister Luisa</i>

01:02.563 --> 01:04.565
<i>was dating Eileen, but Eileen</i>

01:04.565 --> 01:06.650
<i>is really</i>

01:04.565 --> 01:06.650
<i>her old girlfriend, Rose,</i>

01:06.650 --> 01:08.151
<i>aka the crime lord Sin Rostro.</i>

01:08.151 --> 01:10.487
<i>I know, straight out</i>

01:08.151 --> 01:10.487
<i>of a telenovela, right?</i>

01:10.487 --> 01:11.864
<i>And speaking of telenovelas,</i>

01:11.864 --> 01:13.866
<i>Rogelio got a huge new part,</i>

01:13.866 --> 01:16.451
<i>playing someone very tiny.</i>

01:16.451 --> 01:19.413
<i>Unfortunately, he felt chilly</i>

01:16.451 --> 01:19.413
<i>about his new costar Fabian.</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:22.708
<i>But Jane was</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:22.708
<i>positively hot for him.</i>

01:22.708 --> 01:25.460
<i>I know, right?</i>

01:22.708 --> 01:25.460
<i>I'm getting the tingles, too.</i>

01:25.460 --> 01:27.170
<i>So let's get busy, people.</i>

01:28.672 --> 01:30.799
<i>Ah, lust!</i>

01:30.799 --> 01:32.593
<i>Jane Gloriana Villanueva</i>

01:32.593 --> 01:35.470

01:57.242 --> 01:59.787
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

01:57.242 --> 01:59.787
<i>Yeah, I'm uncomfortable, too.</i>

01:59.787 --> 02:01.705

01:59.787 --> 02:01.705
Good episode.

02:01.705 --> 02:02.998
I'm gonna do some homework.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.625
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

02:02.998 --> 02:04.625
<i>So, yeah,</i>

02:04.625 --> 02:06.794
<i>they clearly didn't want</i>

02:04.625 --> 02:06.794
<i>to talk about it.</i>

<i>But, oh, how times</i>

<i>have changed.</i>

02:09.337 --> 02:11.381
Tell me everything.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.008
About what?

02:13.008 --> 02:15.302
Come on, you're clearly

02:13.008 --> 02:15.302
crushing on Fabian.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.720
I am not.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.472
I am reading an article...

02:18.472 --> 02:20.474
about how underboob

02:18.472 --> 02:20.474
is the new side boob.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.435
Oh, please. You've been finding

02:20.474 --> 02:23.435
the most ridiculous excuses

02:23.435 --> 02:24.895
to go see your father on set.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.480
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

02:24.895 --> 02:26.480
<i>True, for the record.</i>

02:26.480 --> 02:29.149
You forgot

02:26.480 --> 02:29.149
your sides at home.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.527
( romantic theme playing )

02:32.527 --> 02:35.447
We shot this yesterday.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.866
( sexy music playing )

02:37.866 --> 02:39.451
JANE:

02:37.866 --> 02:39.451
<i>Más...</i>

02:39.451 --> 02:43.204
<i>Más... Más...</i>

02:44.999 --> 02:48.085
Fine. I may have

02:44.999 --> 02:48.085
a small crush

02:48.085 --> 02:51.212
in that he may excite me

02:48.085 --> 02:51.212
in a superficial way.

02:51.212 --> 02:52.297
So make a move.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.133
Mom, he dated Miss Universe,

02:54.133 --> 02:55.258
Shakira's backup dancer,

02:55.258 --> 02:57.218
and Gisele Bundchen's twin.

02:57.218 --> 02:58.804
For someone

02:57.218 --> 02:58.804
who's not interested,

02:58.804 --> 03:00.347
you sure know a lot about him.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.347
I'm just saying

03:00.347 --> 03:01.515
that I'm not his type.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.641
And-and he's not my type.

03:02.641 --> 03:03.976
Maybe not to date.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.435
But what about a fling?

03:05.435 --> 03:07.479
You ever open to that?

03:10.941 --> 03:12.275
With him?

03:13.735 --> 03:15.403
JANE:

03:13.735 --> 03:15.403
Oh, yeah.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.822
( chuckles )

03:22.243 --> 03:24.038
( woman moans )

03:28.458 --> 03:30.335
So, just casual sex?

03:30.335 --> 03:32.754
No strings.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.090
Why not, right?

03:35.090 --> 03:36.508
I mean, I waited.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.177
I did it.

03:38.177 --> 03:41.221
But now, like,

03:38.177 --> 03:41.221
everything's changed,

03:41.221 --> 03:42.681
and, you know, what...

03:42.681 --> 03:44.224
Oh.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.224
( clears throat )

03:44.224 --> 03:46.810
ALBA ( in Spanish ):

03:44.224 --> 03:46.810
Don't stop on my account.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.604
Your choice is your choice.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.065
She says with

03:49.604 --> 03:51.065
an extra helping

03:51.065 --> 03:52.649
of guilt.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.693
Not everyone wants

03:52.649 --> 03:54.693
to be celibate, Mom.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.695
Hey, how did Jorge

03:54.693 --> 03:56.695
take it?

03:56.695 --> 03:58.363
Hm?

03:58.363 --> 04:00.032
When you told him you

03:58.363 --> 04:00.032
weren't gonna have sex.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.993
Oh, my God,

04:01.241 --> 04:02.993
you didn't tell him.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.078
Ma!

04:04.078 --> 04:05.704
( in Spanish )

04:04.078 --> 04:05.704
I'm nervous.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.665
He had so many girlfriends.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.665
It's hard.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.542
JANE:

04:08.665 --> 04:10.542
No kidding.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.753
Would you like me to give you

04:10.542 --> 04:12.753
the advice you gave me?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.213
No.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.505
( in Spanish )

04:14.213 --> 04:15.505
"If he won't wait,

04:15.505 --> 04:17.049
he's not worth waiting for."

04:17.049 --> 04:19.342
Need a flower to destroy

04:17.049 --> 04:19.342
in your angry fist?

04:19.342 --> 04:20.928
Oh.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.097
( phone ringing )

04:20.928 --> 04:23.097
Oh.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.350
Hey, Jeremy, what's up?

04:27.350 --> 04:29.269
Wait, what?

04:30.187 --> 04:32.106
So...that's it?

04:32.106 --> 04:34.482
A big part of writing is knowing

04:32.106 --> 04:34.482
when to put the pen down.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.026
Pen down.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.821
I love it.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.991
The plot really moves,

04:39.821 --> 04:42.991
the emotional payoff is huge,

04:42.991 --> 04:45.535
and it's romantic as all hell.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.621
Ah...

04:52.333 --> 04:56.130
I can't believe I'm done.

04:52.333 --> 04:56.130
Well, not done.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.672
Writing's only

04:56.130 --> 04:57.672
the half of it, right?

04:57.672 --> 04:59.216
Now the fun part begins.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.926
We gotta drop it like it's hot!

05:00.926 --> 05:03.011
I'll bring the pot holder.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.011
Great!

05:03.011 --> 05:04.930
I set up a meeting with the

05:03.011 --> 05:04.930
marketing and PR departments...

05:04.930 --> 05:06.514
So they can figure out

05:04.930 --> 05:06.514
how to market it

05:06.514 --> 05:08.433
to booksellers and audiences.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.851
That's amazing.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.851
<i>I know!</i>

05:09.851 --> 05:11.728
Anyway, what's up?

05:09.851 --> 05:11.728
Why'd you call?

05:11.728 --> 05:13.855
Ah, it's terrible timing.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.900
What is?

05:13.855 --> 05:16.900
<i>Luisa's coming in tomorrow.</i>

05:16.900 --> 05:19.611
And we're pushing up

05:16.900 --> 05:19.611
our annual shareholder meeting.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.822
Yeah, no problem.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.822
I'll keep Mateo till she's gone.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.954
I'm sorry for messing up

05:26.451 --> 05:28.954
the schedule.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.622
I just wish she would give us

05:28.954 --> 05:30.622
notice for once.

<i>to find out</i>

05:43.342 --> 05:44.678
<i>what this shady dude is up to?</i>

05:44.678 --> 05:46.221
Yup, Luisa's suite is bugged.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.931
And she won't find anything?

05:46.221 --> 05:47.931
No way.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.474
I went in through

05:47.931 --> 05:49.474
Petra's vent.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.892
But trust me, if Rose tries

05:50.892 --> 05:52.644
to get in touch with

05:50.892 --> 05:52.644
your sister, we'll know.

<i>Or rather,</i>

05:58.233 --> 06:00.819
<i>I just explained it.</i>

Good. My family will never feel

completely safe

ROGELIO ( in Spanish ):

06:11.412 --> 06:14.124
We will be safe up

here on her vanity,

06:16.584 --> 06:18.962
The three-legged cat

can't get to us here.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.298
I'm thinking...

We climb on this comb,

we scream so she can find

06:25.719 --> 06:28.096
a way to turn us big again.

06:29.348 --> 06:32.142
( in Spanish )

06:29.348 --> 06:32.142
That is a risky plan!

06:32.142 --> 06:34.477
I would do anything

06:32.142 --> 06:34.477
to be big again,

06:34.477 --> 06:37.105
to be with my love,

06:34.477 --> 06:37.105
the lady scientist.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.024
<i>Also known as a scientist.</i>

06:39.024 --> 06:41.400
But I am also in love

06:39.024 --> 06:41.400
with the lady scientist.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.362
<i>Again, scientist.</i>

06:43.362 --> 06:45.364
What are you talking about?

06:43.362 --> 06:45.364
She is my beloved.

06:45.364 --> 06:47.324
No, she is my beloved!

06:45.364 --> 06:47.324
My beloved!

06:47.324 --> 06:48.742
My beloved!

06:48.742 --> 06:50.369
My beloved!

06:48.742 --> 06:50.369
Enough!

06:50.369 --> 06:51.786
We cannot keep fighting.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.663
Neither of us

06:51.786 --> 06:53.663
will have the lady scientist

06:53.663 --> 06:54.998
if we stay small.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.917
DIRECTOR:

06:54.998 --> 06:56.917
And cut!

06:56.917 --> 06:58.960
Fantastic.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.713
It must be nice not to have to

06:58.960 --> 07:01.713
worry about your body anymore.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.882
Sometimes I feel

07:01.713 --> 07:03.882
like a sex object.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.761
It must be very

07:05.342 --> 07:07.761
hard for you.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.554
Not really, no.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.554
So listen, Ro,

07:09.554 --> 07:11.431
do you want a stunt double for

07:09.554 --> 07:11.431
when you swing from her hair?

07:11.431 --> 07:12.682
Well, I-I-I'd be

07:11.431 --> 07:12.682
happy to do it.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.517
I was an award-winning

07:12.682 --> 07:14.517
stunt double

07:14.517 --> 07:16.353
before I discovered my talent

07:14.517 --> 07:16.353
and passion for acting.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.479
Rogelio de la Vega

07:31.576 --> 07:33.536
I see critters!

07:33.536 --> 07:34.871

07:33.536 --> 07:34.871
Oh.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.040
Oh, now, why are

07:34.871 --> 07:37.040
my legs so heavy?

07:37.040 --> 07:39.334
( girls shrieking )

07:37.040 --> 07:39.334
Did I step in something?

07:39.334 --> 07:41.169
( Chuck laughing )

07:39.334 --> 07:41.169
I didn't know the girls

07:41.169 --> 07:42.629
were hanging out with Chuck.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.881
What happened

07:42.629 --> 07:44.881
to our six-month rule?

07:44.881 --> 07:46.883
You waited six months

07:44.881 --> 07:46.883
to tell them about Abbey

07:46.883 --> 07:48.760
and then broke up

07:46.883 --> 07:48.760
with her anyway.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.346
Besides, they only know

07:48.760 --> 07:51.346
Chuck as Mommy's friend.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.680
Hm.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.516
Hey, girls,

07:52.680 --> 07:55.516
who's this guy?

07:55.516 --> 07:57.352
Mommy's boyfriend.

07:57.352 --> 08:00.521
Smoochie, smoochie!

Yeah, well,

08:08.529 --> 08:09.990
unfortunately,

08:09.990 --> 08:12.451
there are a couple of

08:09.990 --> 08:12.451
holes in your story.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.244
JANE:

08:12.451 --> 08:14.244
<i>My story.</i>

08:14.244 --> 08:17.247
Me, 90 seconds. That's all

they need for the PR meeting.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.540
A snapshot to help

Don't worry,

I have a plan.

08:26.547 --> 08:27.674
What are those?

08:27.674 --> 08:29.009
FABIAN:

08:27.674 --> 08:29.009
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

08:29.009 --> 08:30.969
Goji berries!

08:29.009 --> 08:30.969

08:30.969 --> 08:33.221
Are you serious? They're, like,

08:30.969 --> 08:33.221
my favorite snack.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.723
No way.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.723
What a coincidence!

08:37.642 --> 08:40.020
Have one, please.

08:50.322 --> 08:53.325
Look at this. My hair is a mess,

08:50.322 --> 08:53.325
my forehead is shiny,

08:53.325 --> 08:56.244
I'm holding a doughnut,

08:53.325 --> 08:56.244
and he didn't even use a filter.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.830
You look fine.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.830
Exactly.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.207
"Fine."

09:00.207 --> 09:02.292
Fabian is clearly sabotaging me.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.169
What?

09:02.292 --> 09:04.169
He's trying

09:02.292 --> 09:04.169
to get in my head.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.879
First he comments on my weight,

09:05.879 --> 09:07.755
then on my ability

09:05.879 --> 09:07.755
to do my own stunts.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.258
I am telling you, this is

09:07.755 --> 09:10.258
an<i> All About Eve</i> situation.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.469
Are you sure

09:10.258 --> 09:12.469
you're not overreacting?

09:12.469 --> 09:13.928
This is exactly what happened

09:12.469 --> 09:13.928
in my telenovela,

09:13.928 --> 09:16.056
<i>No Eres Tú, Yo Soy Yo,</i>

09:13.928 --> 09:16.056
<i>Somos Nosotros.</i>

09:16.056 --> 09:18.683
One character tries

09:16.056 --> 09:18.683
to sabotage another character?

09:18.683 --> 09:19.893
What?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.728
No, I did it in real life.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.771
Have you ever heard

09:21.728 --> 09:23.771
of Eduardo Espinosa?

09:23.771 --> 09:25.606
No.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.606
Exactly!

09:26.733 --> 09:27.859
What?

09:29.069 --> 09:30.695
Wh-Wh-Wh...?

09:30.695 --> 09:32.447
Why is Jane

09:30.695 --> 09:32.447
giggling like that?

09:32.447 --> 09:33.990
Take a deep breath.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.742
She might have

09:33.990 --> 09:35.742
a little crush.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.869
That's ridiculous. Jane

09:35.742 --> 09:37.869
would never be interested

09:37.869 --> 09:39.704
in that throw pillow.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.704
Why do you think

09:39.704 --> 09:42.332
she's been making excuses

09:39.704 --> 09:42.332
to come see you all week?

09:43.542 --> 09:45.710
First he goes after my stunt,

09:45.710 --> 09:47.879
and now my daughter?

09:47.879 --> 09:49.506
Fasten your seat belt,

09:49.506 --> 09:53.051
it's going to be

09:49.506 --> 09:53.051
a bumpy afternoon.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.469
FABIAN:

09:53.051 --> 09:54.469
So I massage my kale

09:54.469 --> 09:56.471
for half an hour

09:54.469 --> 09:56.471
with olive oil.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.471
Wow.

09:56.471 --> 09:57.889
That's amazing.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.392
I think super foods

09:57.889 --> 10:00.392
are just so...super.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.227
( laughs )

10:02.227 --> 10:04.812
Excuse me, may I talk

10:02.227 --> 10:04.812
to my daughter privately?

10:04.812 --> 10:06.523
Dad, where are we... What?

10:06.523 --> 10:08.858
Dad, what are you...?

10:08.858 --> 10:10.985
Dad, what is your problem?

10:10.985 --> 10:13.780
My problem is that you've been

10:10.985 --> 10:13.780
pretending to come visit me

10:13.780 --> 10:16.408
to ogle

10:13.780 --> 10:16.408
Fabian's bee-stung lips.

10:16.408 --> 10:17.909
That's right,

10:17.909 --> 10:19.369
your mother told me

10:17.909 --> 10:19.369
all about

10:19.369 --> 10:21.746
your unholy

10:19.369 --> 10:21.746
mega-crush on Fabian.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.832
And I forbid it.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.084
( gasps )

10:33.883 --> 10:37.637
See, Dad, look around.

10:33.883 --> 10:37.637
Actual walls for privacy!

10:37.637 --> 10:40.432
I am sorry, Jane. I didn't

10:37.637 --> 10:40.432
mean for Fabian to overhear.

10:40.432 --> 10:43.310
I'm just concerned.

10:40.432 --> 10:43.310
The guy's a total playboy.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.228
I just don't want you

Fine. I'll talk to Fabian

and make things better.

No! Dad,<i> you</i> need to stay out

Well, don't worry.

Your client's

13:07.954 --> 13:09.872
story isn't true.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.583
We tapped her computer.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.543
Is that legal?

13:11.583 --> 13:13.543
With a subpoena, yes.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.878
Which we got after finding out

13:13.543 --> 13:15.878
that you had just scooched

13:20.216 --> 13:22.427
You've been e-mailing her.

13:22.427 --> 13:25.054
You don't have to say anything.

13:22.427 --> 13:25.054
It's fine.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.640
I've been sending her money.

13:26.640 --> 13:30.059
Yes, but it's just

13:26.640 --> 13:30.059
to keep her away.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.603
It has nothing

13:30.059 --> 13:31.603
to do with Scott.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.480
And I didn't

13:31.603 --> 13:33.480
tell you earlier

13:33.480 --> 13:37.442

Well, we need

13:42.405 --> 13:44.783
So you need to convince her

13:42.405 --> 13:44.783
to return to Miami.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.409
I'd really prefer not to.

Oh.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.996
Well, it's your choice.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.914
Of course, if you don't,

13:49.996 --> 13:51.914
we'll charge you

13:51.914 --> 13:53.916
with obstructing

13:51.914 --> 13:53.916
a police investigation.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.502

These are for Mateo.

I want my nephew to know that

14:27.450 --> 14:29.035
he has an auntie

I'm just going

14:35.916 --> 14:37.794

14:37.794 --> 14:40.921

14:40.921 --> 14:43.132
to meet very soon.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.092
Yes. Great.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.092
We'll see.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.763
So, Raf, we saw a bunch

14:46.720 --> 14:48.763
of cops around outside.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.306
What's that about?

14:50.306 --> 14:53.059
They're investigating

14:50.306 --> 14:53.059
Scott's death.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.935
I thought

14:53.059 --> 14:54.935
it was an accident.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.605
Yeah, well,

14:54.935 --> 14:57.605
now they're not so sure.

14:57.605 --> 14:58.857
Did you...?

14:58.857 --> 15:00.066
( mouths )

15:01.359 --> 15:03.528
You know how hard it is

15:01.359 --> 15:03.528
for me to fall asleep

15:03.528 --> 15:05.112
when I'm not in my own bed,

15:05.112 --> 15:06.573
so I got this contraption

15:05.112 --> 15:06.573
that makes wave sounds.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.116
( loud wave sounds playing )

15:09.116 --> 15:10.993
( whispering ):

15:09.116 --> 15:10.993
Of course I did

15:09.116 --> 15:10.993
not kill Scott!

15:10.993 --> 15:12.912
( quietly ):

15:10.993 --> 15:12.912
Oh, we were here

15:10.993 --> 15:12.912
right around then.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.581
Are you saying

15:12.912 --> 15:14.581
it was just a coincidence?

15:14.581 --> 15:16.416
Yes, because we were

15:14.581 --> 15:16.416
together that whole trip.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.418
We sent away the real Eileen,

15:16.416 --> 15:18.418
and then we made love.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.253
There was no time for me

15:18.418 --> 15:20.253
to have murdered him.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.881
But you did leave

15:20.253 --> 15:22.881
the room once. Remember?

15:22.881 --> 15:25.383
I had to stop having sex

15:22.881 --> 15:25.383
and then take a shower

15:25.383 --> 15:27.968
'cause the lotion

15:25.383 --> 15:27.968
we were using gave me a rash?

15:27.968 --> 15:30.054
And then we figured we might

15:27.968 --> 15:30.054
as well get some Chinese?

15:30.054 --> 15:33.516
And then, while I showered,

15:30.054 --> 15:33.516
you went to get the food.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.685
No, I was going to go

15:33.516 --> 15:35.685
pick up the Chinese food,

15:35.685 --> 15:37.019
but we ended up

15:35.685 --> 15:37.019
having it delivered,

15:37.019 --> 15:38.646
and the concierge

15:37.019 --> 15:38.646
brought it up to us.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.440
Because at that point,

15:40.440 --> 15:42.609
the oil was starting

15:40.440 --> 15:42.609
to bother me, too, remember?

15:43.651 --> 15:45.319
( sighs )

15:45.319 --> 15:47.947
And this is why I hate

15:45.319 --> 15:47.947
coming to the Marbella,

15:47.947 --> 15:50.658
because we always

15:47.947 --> 15:50.658
start fighting.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.326
I know.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.328
You're right.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.915
We need to switch

15:54.328 --> 15:56.915
rooms, just in case.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.083
In case what?

15:59.083 --> 16:01.377
In case the cops are

15:59.083 --> 16:01.377
here because of us...

16:01.377 --> 16:03.671
and your room is wired.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.757
You're being paranoid.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.801
So, yes,

16:05.757 --> 16:07.801
I was strongly influenced

16:07.801 --> 16:09.928
by the telenovelas

16:07.801 --> 16:09.928
I grew up watching.

16:09.928 --> 16:12.847
But also by the romance novels

16:09.928 --> 16:12.847
I grew up reading.

16:12.847 --> 16:16.100
And I think you feel

16:12.847 --> 16:16.100
both influences in my book.

Oh, wow.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.980
Well, it's an amazing

16:59.519 --> 17:01.980
backstory, and the fact

17:01.980 --> 17:04.899
that it's all

17:01.980 --> 17:04.899
thinly veiled in there--

17:04.899 --> 17:08.152
Well, it gives us

Right. Yes.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.698
Uh, here's the thing.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.367
I know it's a wild story,

17:11.698 --> 17:14.367
but I actually think

17:14.367 --> 17:17.370
that if it's out there,

17:14.367 --> 17:17.370
it would kind of take over.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.079
And it was

17:17.370 --> 17:19.079
pretty traumatic,

so I don't

18:18.264 --> 18:20.140
it was a secret.

18:20.140 --> 18:23.811
wanted to publish my book?

18:23.811 --> 18:26.105
No. I liked your writing.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.608

18:59.680 --> 19:01.515
Too bad.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.601
A big social media

19:01.515 --> 19:03.601
following makes them think

19:03.601 --> 19:05.895
you'll draw attendees, which is

19:03.601 --> 19:05.895
what the organizers are after.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.022
How many followers do I need

19:05.895 --> 19:08.022
to get into the fair?

19:08.022 --> 19:10.399
20K, minimum,

19:08.022 --> 19:10.399
but there's no way in hell

19:10.399 --> 19:12.276
you're gonna get that many

19:10.399 --> 19:12.276
followers that quickly.

19:14.361 --> 19:17.197

Oh, he pulled a muscle

19:26.833 --> 19:28.709
doing a stunt.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.253
No, he's fine. He's just

19:28.709 --> 19:31.253
having an emergency massage.

Oh.

I am.

Fine.

I, uh, bought her a ticket,

promised I'd buy her

20:17.341 --> 20:19.052
an electric bike.

She's on her way.

You okay?

20:21.762 --> 20:23.931
Yeah. It'll be fine.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.307
She'll answer some

questions, then leave.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.101
Oh, come on.

It's got to be traumatic

20:27.101 --> 20:28.602
to see her again.

20:28.602 --> 20:29.979

CHUCK:

20:29.979 --> 20:31.981
She don't need to call her.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.525
We talked about it a bunch.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.525
She's fine.

Appreciate

20:34.525 --> 20:35.776

you weren't around

20:37.028 --> 20:38.320
when Anezka was here.

Yeah, that's...

20:40.990 --> 20:42.366
the same as actually being here.

No.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.624
Ah-ha-- You see?

24:58.914 --> 25:00.624
You see that?

25:00.624 --> 25:03.252
You're being paranoid.

25:00.624 --> 25:03.252
Maybe. But I am not leaving

25:03.252 --> 25:05.338
this room unattended.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.338
Well-- ( scoffs )

25:05.338 --> 25:07.547
Then what am I supposed

25:05.338 --> 25:07.547
to tell Rafael?

25:07.547 --> 25:10.176
I don't know what to tell you

25:07.547 --> 25:10.176
except it blows.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.677
I couldn't get

25:10.176 --> 25:11.677
the book fair to bite.

25:11.677 --> 25:14.221
But you said if I had

25:11.677 --> 25:14.221
20,000 followers...

25:15.889 --> 25:18.476

Yeah. Me, too.

25:31.447 --> 25:32.530

25:32.530 --> 25:34.325
So here's my

25:32.530 --> 25:34.325
frustration.

25:34.325 --> 25:36.285
If you look up to me so much,

25:34.325 --> 25:36.285
why would you assume

25:36.285 --> 25:38.245
I need a stunt double?

25:38.245 --> 25:39.872
And why would you

25:38.245 --> 25:39.872
take that dig at me

25:39.872 --> 25:41.623
about not needing to take

25:39.872 --> 25:41.623
my shirt off anymore?

25:41.623 --> 25:42.791
No, those-those weren't digs.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.502
I swear.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.502
All I meant was that

25:44.502 --> 25:46.586
the show would fall apart

25:44.502 --> 25:46.586
if you got hurt.

25:46.586 --> 25:48.714
Without you,

25:46.586 --> 25:48.714
the show is nothing.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.841
Just...my abs.

26:05.523 --> 26:07.483
That's enough about that.

26:07.483 --> 26:10.361
And no more using my daughter

26:10.361 --> 26:12.279
and toying with her feelings.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.531
Jane?

26:12.279 --> 26:13.531
Yes.

But you do not mess

26:18.411 --> 26:20.454

26:20.454 --> 26:23.207
You don't have to worry--

26:20.454 --> 26:23.207
she said she didn't like me.

26:23.207 --> 26:25.042
( short chuckle )

26:25.042 --> 26:27.794
Okay. General rule:

26:27.794 --> 26:31.673
when you look like we do,

26:27.794 --> 26:31.673
you can never rule that out.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.384
Ah! I get it.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.384
( laughs )

26:33.384 --> 26:34.634
I understand.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.136

26:40.724 --> 26:42.101
We're gonna be climbing

26:40.724 --> 26:42.101

26:42.101 --> 26:43.936
That means a lot of

anything would help.

26:59.617 --> 27:01.370
From me? I'm flattered.

Well...sort of more

27:03.038 --> 27:05.291
from your well-known

27:05.291 --> 27:07.543
You're kind of blurb-adjacent.

Oh, I see how it is. You only

27:07.543 --> 27:10.087
come when you need a favor.

27:10.087 --> 27:11.964
That is not true.

But, yes, I do happen

27:13.924 --> 27:17.136
to need one today.

27:17.136 --> 27:20.598
The publisher

27:17.136 --> 27:20.598
only ordered 10,000 copies.

27:20.598 --> 27:21.807
Ooh.

27:21.807 --> 27:24.101
I know. Actually,

27:24.101 --> 27:26.061
you're probably the one person

27:24.101 --> 27:26.061
who will understand this,

27:26.061 --> 27:27.645

27:26.061 --> 27:27.645
to fight for my art.

27:27.645 --> 27:30.190

27:27.645 --> 27:30.190
Well, I could get them

to print more copies and give

27:30.190 --> 27:32.776
a bigger marketing budget

27:32.776 --> 27:36.447
if I agree to talk about

27:32.776 --> 27:36.447
my whole crazy backstory.

27:36.447 --> 27:37.823
But of course

27:36.447 --> 27:37.823
I said no, because

27:37.823 --> 27:39.699
I want my book

27:37.823 --> 27:39.699
to stand on its own.

27:39.699 --> 27:41.535

in Boca with the other

7,000 unsold copies.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.463
You talked

32:01.670 --> 32:03.463
about your late husband.

32:03.463 --> 32:06.383
How much of the rest

32:03.463 --> 32:06.383
made it into the book?

32:06.383 --> 32:08.510
Let's just say

32:06.383 --> 32:08.510
there's a lot in there.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.220
Thinly veiled.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.220
Any hesitation

32:10.220 --> 32:11.597
talking about this stuff?

32:11.597 --> 32:13.265
Oh, yeah. Tons.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.893
Because with writing

32:13.265 --> 32:15.893
comes exposure,

32:15.893 --> 32:17.519
and with exposure

32:15.893 --> 32:17.519
comes vulnerability.

32:17.519 --> 32:19.271
And there are all these stages

32:19.271 --> 32:21.231
of exposing yourself.

32:21.231 --> 32:22.524
First with writing the book.

32:22.524 --> 32:23.901
Then marketing it.

32:23.901 --> 32:26.236
Uh, and the last is

32:23.901 --> 32:26.236
people reading the book.

32:26.236 --> 32:27.946
That's important,

32:27.946 --> 32:29.489
because otherwise I'd just

32:27.946 --> 32:29.489
be writing in my diary.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.032
So please go buy the

32:29.489 --> 32:31.032
book. Please, please.

32:51.845 --> 32:54.640
Mommy,

32:51.845 --> 32:54.640
I want to read your book.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.850
When you're older,

33:00.729 --> 33:03.189
Sorry to interrupt,

33:00.729 --> 33:03.189
but I just had to say hello.

33:03.189 --> 33:05.233
Oh, hello.

33:03.189 --> 33:05.233
My friend works at

33:03.189 --> 33:05.233
a publishing house

33:05.233 --> 33:07.527
and got me an advance copy

33:05.233 --> 33:07.527
of your book.

33:07.527 --> 33:08.695
I loved it so much.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.405
Wow, really?

33:10.405 --> 33:12.407
You're the first person

33:10.405 --> 33:12.407
who's read it who I don't know.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.618
I didn't get out of my pajamas

33:12.407 --> 33:14.618
until I finished.

33:14.618 --> 33:17.287
You are making my life

33:14.618 --> 33:17.287

Mm-hm.

33:25.086 --> 33:27.506
Aw.

33:27.506 --> 33:30.008
I am passing the baton.

33:37.850 --> 33:40.727
I mean, it was

33:37.850 --> 33:40.727
only three autographs,

33:40.727 --> 33:42.354
but it was kind of awesome.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.397
And I can't believe

33:42.354 --> 33:44.397
I'm even saying that.

33:44.397 --> 33:46.024
Good, you deserved it.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.819
Celebrate

33:46.024 --> 33:48.819
in your room tonight...

33:48.819 --> 33:50.153
with this.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.655
Don't be gross!

33:51.655 --> 33:53.198
I'm over Fabian.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.658
He texted and said he'd come

33:53.198 --> 33:54.658
to the book fair,

33:54.658 --> 33:55.993
and then he bailed on me.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.286
Fame is my new lover.

Oh, can we talk?

34:13.719 --> 34:16.054
Fabian, what are you doing here?

34:16.054 --> 34:18.557
I... Unh.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.557
Oh.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.895
I... I couldn't stop

34:21.226 --> 34:22.895
thinking about you

34:22.895 --> 34:24.270
after the book fair.

34:24.270 --> 34:26.023
You were there?

34:26.023 --> 34:27.315
Why didn't you say hello?

34:27.315 --> 34:29.609
I was too nervous.

34:29.609 --> 34:30.777
What?

34:29.609 --> 34:30.777
Your words

34:30.777 --> 34:32.070
were so incredible.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.947
What you said

34:32.070 --> 34:33.947
about being exposed,

34:33.947 --> 34:35.448
it really spoke to me.

34:35.448 --> 34:38.035
And I think you'll see why

34:35.448 --> 34:38.035
when you read my book.

34:38.035 --> 34:40.078
Oh.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.580
I can't wait to open it.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.206
That's my book.

Yeah, you just said.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.708
( clears throat )

34:44.708 --> 34:46.251
Also, I spoke to your dad,

34:46.251 --> 34:47.711
and I told him

34:46.251 --> 34:47.711
that I was coming here

34:47.711 --> 34:49.128
and that I wanted

34:47.711 --> 34:49.128
to ask you out.

34:49.128 --> 34:51.673
( gasps )

34:49.128 --> 34:51.673
He said it's okay.

34:51.673 --> 34:53.842
He did?

34:53.842 --> 34:55.385
Is that what's happening?

It is.

Okay, so, when are

35:34.758 --> 35:37.135
we gonna have a talk

35:37.135 --> 35:40.305
about the fact that your ex

35:37.135 --> 35:40.305
still has the hots for you?

35:40.305 --> 35:42.724
Heh. What?

35:42.724 --> 35:44.768
No, he doesn't.

35:42.724 --> 35:44.768
Yes, he does.

35:44.768 --> 35:46.227
And if you can't see it,

35:46.227 --> 35:48.438
you're blinder than

35:46.227 --> 35:48.438
a bat in a chimney fire.

35:50.189 --> 35:52.109
Stop,

35:50.189 --> 35:52.109
you're being ridiculous.

35:53.693 --> 35:56.696
The new shipment

35:53.693 --> 35:56.696

35:56.696 --> 35:57.990

36:02.619 --> 36:04.621
But Alba, wait.

36:06.205 --> 36:09.918
I wish things didn't have

36:06.205 --> 36:09.918
to be like this between us.

36:09.918 --> 36:13.379
I can't help who I am

36:09.918 --> 36:13.379
when it comes to premarital sex.

36:13.379 --> 36:15.507
So why does that mean

36:13.379 --> 36:15.507
we have to break up?

36:15.507 --> 36:16.800
You tell me.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.468
But you broke up with me.

36:18.468 --> 36:19.970
I did not break up with you.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.681
You didn't even call me.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.681
Or text me.

36:22.681 --> 36:26.852
I don't know how to text.

36:22.681 --> 36:26.852
I have a flip phone.

36:26.852 --> 36:29.312
You seemed so upset.

36:29.312 --> 36:31.189
I was just surprised.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.732
( sighs )

36:32.732 --> 36:37.112
But Alba,

36:32.732 --> 36:37.112
I care about you.

36:37.112 --> 36:42.909
If you don't want to have sex,

36:37.112 --> 36:42.909
I can live with that.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.286
Heh, I'm not 62 anymore.

36:45.286 --> 36:48.456

36:59.258 --> 37:00.844

Oh, and you're here

37:03.055 --> 37:05.849
to see Fabian.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.934
Wait, he said

37:05.849 --> 37:07.934
he spoke to you.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.895
Of course. Of course, yes.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.895
Go to him.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.771
You okay, Dad?

37:11.771 --> 37:14.149
ROGELIO:

37:11.771 --> 37:14.149
O-Oh, yes. I just have to accept

37:14.149 --> 37:16.484
that I'm no longer the only

37:14.149 --> 37:16.484
telenovela star in your life.

37:16.484 --> 37:19.487
Hey.

But you can't fool me.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.794
What's really going on?

37:34.794 --> 37:38.006
It's just hard thinking about

37:34.794 --> 37:38.006
Jane dating someone new.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.675
And I know it's not fair.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.675
I know she has to move on.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.427
No, it's okay.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.888
I just don't want

37:42.427 --> 37:44.888
to start getting mani-pedis

And I still think about him

37:58.151 --> 38:01.071
every single day.

38:01.071 --> 38:03.823
I know.

38:03.823 --> 38:06.534
A-And I never want

38:03.823 --> 38:06.534
to burden Jane.

38:07.535 --> 38:10.413
I know that, too.

38:10.413 --> 38:11.915
Thank you for telling me.

38:11.915 --> 38:14.084
Mm-hm.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.764
<i>Also about to get screwed?</i>

39:09.764 --> 39:11.224
Anezka should have landed

39:09.764 --> 39:11.224
by now.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.892
Okay, calm down.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.892
She's not that late.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.602
I can't calm down.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.602
You have no idea

39:14.602 --> 39:15.937
what she's capable of doing.

39:21.109 --> 39:22.652
Why isn't she answering?

39:22.652 --> 39:24.445
She's probably

39:22.652 --> 39:24.445
just getting her luggage.

39:24.445 --> 39:27.073
No. Something is off.

39:27.073 --> 39:29.201
You're wrong.

39:27.073 --> 39:29.201
I am not.

39:29.201 --> 39:31.828
And I am sick of being cooped up

39:31.828 --> 39:33.330
in this sweaty room.

39:33.330 --> 39:36.415
So I am going

39:33.330 --> 39:36.415
to put my face back on,

39:36.415 --> 39:38.126
and then

39:36.415 --> 39:38.126
we are going to leave.

39:38.126 --> 39:39.627
No.

39:41.420 --> 39:42.672
What?

39:42.672 --> 39:44.716
I don't want to leave.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.386
I'm finally having

39:46.301 --> 39:48.386
a breakthrough

39:48.386 --> 39:50.889
with Rafael,

39:48.386 --> 39:50.889
and I might meet his kids.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.431
Well...

39:52.431 --> 39:54.433
we can't stay.

39:54.433 --> 39:56.644
Please.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.647
I'm leaving, Luisa.

40:01.691 --> 40:03.401
Are you coming with me?

40:04.777 --> 40:06.696
PETRA: Hello?

40:04.777 --> 40:06.696
ANEZKA ( on phone ):<i> Sister!</i>

40:06.696 --> 40:08.156
Anezka, where are you? You were

40:06.696 --> 40:08.156
supposed to get in a cab

40:08.156 --> 40:09.866
and come straight

40:08.156 --> 40:09.866
to the Marbella.

40:09.866 --> 40:11.826
I couldn't do that because

40:09.866 --> 40:11.826
when I got off the plane,

40:11.826 --> 40:13.203
the police were arresting me.

40:13.203 --> 40:14.620
Wait, what?

40:14.620 --> 40:16.081
You said they were

40:14.620 --> 40:16.081
just going to ask questions

40:16.081 --> 40:17.498
and then

40:16.081 --> 40:17.498
I would get electric bike.

40:17.498 --> 40:19.251
Yeah, well...

40:17.498 --> 40:19.251
that's what they said.

40:19.251 --> 40:20.919
I'm in jail, Petra.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.754
No. No, no, no.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.754
That-- That wasn't the deal.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.547
No, they promised

40:22.754 --> 40:24.547
it was just questions.

40:24.547 --> 40:26.174
Well, you better fix this,

40:26.174 --> 40:28.385
or I will tell them

40:26.174 --> 40:28.385
all what I know.

40:28.385 --> 40:31.388
And then you, sister, will be

40:28.385 --> 40:31.388
in orange jumpsuit with me.

40:31.388 --> 40:34.182
<i>( suspenseful theme playing )</i>

40:36.309 --> 40:38.395
<i>( keyboard clacking )</i>

40:44.984 --> 40:48.988
<i>( theme music playing )</i>
