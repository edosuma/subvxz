Ghost.Whisperer
Season 01 Episode 08

00:06.300 --> 00:08.300
My name is melinda gordon

00:10.400 --> 00:15.000
I just got married,just moved to a small town,
just opened up an antique shop

00:15.400 --> 00:17.300
I might be just like you

00:18.200 --> 00:22.100
Except from the time that I was a little girl,
I knew that I could talk to the dead

00:23.600 --> 00:24.700
It's all right, honey

00:24.800 --> 00:26.800
Earthbound spirits,my grandmother called them

00:27.200 --> 00:30.600
the ones who have not crossed over yet
because they have unfinished business with the living

00:30.700 --> 00:32.800
and they come to me for help

00:33.700 --> 00:37.200
To tell you my story,I have to tell you theirs

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Hey

00:48.400 --> 00:51.200
Thank god you're home.This is not the kind of movie you wanna watch alone

00:52.500 --> 00:55.500
Wait. You've seen this before.How is it still scary?

00:55.600 --> 00:58.500
I don't know.It just is. You ok?

00:58.600 --> 01:01.600
Hard day.I'm fine now

01:02.300 --> 01:03.800
Will you hold my hand and watch this with me?

01:03.900 --> 01:06.500
-Sure. I'll just jump in the shower first
-Oh, hurry up

01:15.800 --> 01:19.300
You ever have one of those days where everything just feels weird?

01:19.700 --> 01:23.300
Don't go in there.I mean, why?Why do you do that?

01:23.400 --> 01:26.800
Like I'm wearing the wrong pair of glasses or something

01:27.400 --> 01:31.300
Which is weird, since I don't wear glasses

01:42.200 --> 01:45.200
Oh! Turn the lights on, bimbo

01:57.400 --> 01:59.000
What?

02:03.100 --> 02:04.400
jim!

02:05.300 --> 02:11.200
No, I'm fine.It's just the plumbing job I did yesterday
must have knocked some rust into the pipes

02:11.300 --> 02:14.400
Oh, I should've told you.I'm sorry.Watching my face? Gross

02:31.500 --> 02:33.300
What's the matter?

02:34.200 --> 02:38.200
I'm just gonna lock up.Watch the movie.I'll be right back

03:28.000 --> 03:29.900
It looks like smoke and his asthma

03:30.800 --> 03:34.700
-All closed up. Agonal respiration
-Let's get a pediatric mask and start albuterol treatment

03:36.300 --> 03:37.500
Come on. Give me that mask

03:37.600 --> 03:40.300
B.P. 140 over 90

03:41.500 --> 03:43.100
-Do you see any burns?
-Uh-uh

03:45.500 --> 03:47.600
Blood pressure is dropping

03:49.300 --> 03:55.200
-Jim. Jim!B.P.'S dropping.We're losing her
-We're not losing her

03:55.700 --> 03:58.800
-Come on, man!
-Yeah. Come on. We're not losing her. Breathe

04:02.500 --> 04:06.600
Ok. Respiration's stabilizing.She's coming back

04:08.000 --> 04:10.900
-You sure you're ok?
-I'm all right

04:29.600 --> 04:32.600
-Did you say something?
-Me? No. Mm-mmm

04:32.800 --> 04:35.700
-I ran into
-do you tell me--sorry

04:36.900 --> 04:41.200
-Go ahead
-No. You.Do I tell you...

04:44.400 --> 04:48.600
do you always tell me, you know, when you see spirits?

04:49.000 --> 04:52.900
Or are there so many of them you don't even mention it?

04:53.300 --> 04:55.300
Door number 2

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
-I don't know how you deal with that
-I just factor it in,move on.I guess I'd go crazy if I didn't

05:06.100 --> 05:07.700
Is there someone here now?

05:09.500 --> 05:11.500
No

05:11.600 --> 05:13.300
Are you sure?

05:13.500 --> 05:17.800
Jim, what's going on? You've been acting really weird lately
Is something bothering you?

05:19.500 --> 05:23.900
Look, ok.I don't know if it's...just being with you,you know

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
If it's rubbing off on me or something.
But lately I'm having these feelings

05:28.600 --> 05:30.100
What kind of feelings?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Like I'm being watched

05:35.000 --> 05:37.300
And when it happens,I'm just...

05:38.500 --> 05:44.400
flooded with this...with this sense of anxiety or,
I don't know,with despair or something

05:45.500 --> 05:48.500
It's like I'm in the presence of just...

05:56.000 --> 05:57.600
talk about going crazy

05:58.000 --> 06:01.400
-Why, did something already happen?
-You know it's probably just nerves. I'm fine

06:01.500 --> 06:03.800
-Do you want some more?
-No

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
He just seems so different

06:17.300 --> 06:22.800
-Different how?
-Distracted. Moody. Maybe the romance is fading

06:22.900 --> 06:27.700
Are you serious? Jim is nuts over you.
You can feel the chemistry from like pluto

06:28.000 --> 06:29.400
Then what's wrong?

06:29.500 --> 06:33.600
-Excuse me, but this...migs?
-Alexis

06:34.200 --> 06:38.000
-What are you doing here?
-I live here

06:38.100 --> 06:41.400
Well, this is incredible. Come here, hon. Give me a hug

06:42.000 --> 06:47.400
-Uh, so, what are you doing here?
-I'm writing a travel article for a magazine

06:48.000 --> 06:52.200
-I...Hi.Lexi fogerty.
-Hi

06:52.300 --> 06:56.900
Melinda and I were best friends for like ever.Right, migs?

06:57.400 --> 07:00.200
Andrea owns the store with me

07:00.700 --> 07:03.800
Yeah. Uh, it's nice to meet you

07:06.200 --> 07:10.900
Wow. I...I have so much I wanna say to you, migs

07:11.200 --> 07:14.400
I know we left things a little bumpy. But...

07:14.700 --> 07:17.200
hey.Can I take you to lunch?

07:17.300 --> 07:22.500
Oh, I can't, alexis. I'm very busy right now

07:23.900 --> 07:30.500
Tell you what. Um, I'll be here all weekend.
So give me a call,Here's my cell phone number

07:31.500 --> 07:33.300
Bye

07:39.800 --> 07:42.700
-Whoa. What was that?
-What?

07:43.300 --> 07:46.700
-You just totally iced that girl.
-No, I did not

07:46.800 --> 07:49.300
Melinda, I have like freezer burn over here

07:51.000 --> 07:55.600
-Ok,we used to be best friends,and we're not anymore
-I got that

07:56.300 --> 08:01.000
-What happened?
-We just drifted apart

08:04.700 --> 08:07.400
Oh, hey.What brings you here?

08:07.600 --> 08:11.000
-Bringing you lunch
-Well, what happened? A check bounce?

08:11.100 --> 08:16.400
No. Just felt like feeding my husband and,
you know,seeing how you're doing

08:16.500 --> 08:18.700
I'm fine. I think actually I figured it out

08:18.800 --> 08:20.100
-You did?
-Yeah

08:21.800 --> 08:27.200
My dad died this week 5 years ago.You know about this time
I always start to go into a kind of funk

08:27.300 --> 08:33.200
The only difference is this year I forgot.So maybe it's just been
weighing on me, and I didn't even notice it

08:33.299 --> 08:37.299
-Huh. Ok, so you're feeling better now?
-Yeah, absolutely

08:37.400 --> 08:41.200
-You sure then?
-Yeah.You worry too much

08:41.600 --> 08:44.000
I worry just enough. I'm going to work

08:44.100 --> 08:47.400
-Love you
-Mmm. Love you back

08:47.500 --> 08:53.900
Mandatory training video  will be shown 11:30.
All personnel  are required to attend

08:55.500 --> 09:00.800
-Young lady, I'm looking for my carriage and driver.Have you seen them?
-No. Sorry

09:00.900 --> 09:04.800
Good lord. The theater's been out for ages.What will I tell my wife?

09:36.500 --> 09:39.400
I only saw him for a second,
but this guy scared the hell out of me

09:40.100 --> 09:42.200
And I don't scare that easy

09:42.300 --> 09:45.400
Please.We saw the ring together.
You spent the whole movie under your seat

09:45.500 --> 09:50.200
That was fiction. This is real life.
I've seen a lot of ghosts.This guy made my blood run cold

09:50.300 --> 09:53.300
It was like the evils of the universe were just seeping out of him

09:53.400 --> 09:56.500
Ugh. And you think one of these things has attached itself to jim?

09:56.600 --> 10:02.300
It makes sense.He's moody. He's not eating.He has these waves of despair.Nothing like this has ever happened to him

10:02.400 --> 10:06.500
So assuming you're right, what do you do
to get rid of a malevolent spirit?

10:06.800 --> 10:09.300
I don't know. My grandmother never walked me through this one

10:09.400 --> 10:15.000
-Melinda.Not comforting
-You know what? It's time to open.You finish up.No hurry

10:18.400 --> 10:25.000
Be prepared to provide resuscitation if the patient stops breathing
or experiences sudden cardiac arrest

10:25.100 --> 10:30.500
So when available,bring an automated external defibrillator
to the patient's location

10:31.100 --> 10:37.700
A professional medical care provider should evaluate
anyone suspected of experiencing a heart problem

10:37.800 --> 10:44.300
Jim. Help me, son. Please, jim! Please!

10:45.500 --> 10:49.700
jim!Help me, son.Please.Help

10:58.300 --> 10:59.300
Jim?

11:00.600 --> 11:03.200
-Jim?
-In here

11:05.000 --> 11:09.200
Are you ok? They told me you were sent home

11:11.800 --> 11:14.300
I saw my dad, mel

11:16.000 --> 11:21.200
This, uh,stupid training film,It wasn't him at first,
but then it was clearly him

11:22.000 --> 11:25.700
He's yelling for me to help him.What is going on?

11:27.600 --> 11:31.500
Uh...I think I was wrong

11:31.800 --> 11:34.600
There is a spirit attached to you, and, um...

11:34.700 --> 11:36.200
but you didn't see one

11:36.300 --> 11:40.700
No. Not now. But I saw someone at the firehouse this morning,
and he really scared me

11:40.800 --> 11:43.000
What did he look like?

11:43.100 --> 11:48.800
Um, shaved-out hair, dark eyes, and completely covered in tattoos

12:03.400 --> 12:07.600
Mel, it's the patient who died when we flipped the rig.
When we blew the tire. Remember?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.300
The guy who was on his way to kill his wife?

12:11.000 --> 12:14.700
-What does he want?
-No wonder he attached himself to you

12:15.200 --> 12:19.400
-You're the last person that he saw as he died
-Does he blame me for his death? Does he want revenge?

12:19.500 --> 12:23.200
-I don't know.
-At least I'm not crazy

12:24.000 --> 12:26.600
Hey, we're gonna figure this out, all right?

12:27.200 --> 12:32.500
And I'm gonna stick to you like glue
until I see this ghost again

12:41.500 --> 12:45.400
Hey, guys.Everything ok?

12:47.000 --> 12:51.600
-Yeah. Everything's fine.Why?
-No reason

12:52.200 --> 12:58.700
-You know, I just came to fix the cabinet
-Oh. Wow. Thanks, jim.It's driving us crazy

13:04.600 --> 13:08.100
Oh, god. What happened? You ran out of here so fast

13:08.200 --> 13:12.400
Jim had some kind of an episode.
Thought he saw his dead father

13:12.500 --> 13:14.000
Jim is seeing ghosts?

13:14.100 --> 13:18.900
No. No.I just think the spirit or whatever it is
is messing with his head

13:19.000 --> 13:21.400
Creepy.What are you gonna do?

13:21.500 --> 13:25.900
There's nothing I can do except wait
until I see the ghost.That's why he's here

13:29.000 --> 13:30.700
Nothing

13:33.000 --> 13:36.100
Do you want us to go? Caus I don't wanna freak you out

13:36.300 --> 13:39.000
No. Of course not. What's A...

13:39.300 --> 13:41.800
malevolent spirit or two between friends, right?

13:43.200 --> 13:47.300
-Hey, where did those come from?
-Aren't they pretty?Lexi brought them by

13:47.500 --> 13:51.700
She is really trying to reach out to you.
I don't know why you guys drifted apart,but...

13:51.800 --> 13:55.000
Ok,I lied.We didn't drift.It was more like crash and burn

13:55.200 --> 13:58.100
Oh. You wanna talk about it?

13:58.600 --> 14:01.000
Freshman year of college

14:01.100 --> 14:04.500
Lexi--she started telling people about my abilities

14:04.600 --> 14:09.400
And before I knew it, I had become some kind of laughingstock

14:10.900 --> 14:13.500
I got so uncomfortable,I finally left school

14:14.600 --> 14:15.800
Oh, melinda

14:15.900 --> 14:20.100
The funny thing is, there's a part of me that wishes
alexis and I were still friends

14:20.200 --> 14:27.000
No. Are you kidding me? You can never speak to her again.Never.Ever

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
-Anything?
-No

14:41.100 --> 14:45.100
I thought attached meant "attached."
Why do they come and go?

14:45.200 --> 14:50.000
They feed off our energy,off our emotions.
It's like recharging their batteries

14:50.100 --> 14:52.700
Then they're free to wander off for a while

14:52.800 --> 14:57.700
-Well, do they ever wander off and never come back?
-Not that I know of

14:58.300 --> 15:02.000
I thought you were gonna say that.You're chilly. I'm sorry

15:02.700 --> 15:05.000
Oh. I'll turn on the space heater.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.000
I blew a fuse.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.100
Oh, really?Well, why don't you come back to bed
and we'll fix it tomorrow

15:19.200 --> 15:24.600
-Why, honey? You're afraid?
-No, I'm not scared

15:24.700 --> 15:29.100
-I'm gonna come with you,though
-I just blew a fuse.I overloaded the circuit

15:29.200 --> 15:30.200
I'll be right back

15:30.300 --> 15:32.800
-Candle?
-You keep it

15:37.600 --> 15:41.800
-Are you there now?
-Not yet. I'm on my way down to the basement

15:43.600 --> 15:47.100
-You wanna do me a favor?Can you unplug the space heater?
-Ok

15:55.200 --> 15:58.700
I can see you.And you don't scare me. You don't

15:59.400 --> 16:03.200
Who are you? And what do you want with my husband?

16:05.500 --> 16:07.700
It's not your husband I want

16:15.400 --> 16:17.600
It's you

16:19.500 --> 16:23.200
Me? What do you want with me?

16:25.100 --> 16:27.100
I need help

16:27.300 --> 16:33.900
You see us.All the lost souls

16:34.200 --> 16:37.600
I-I feel very dark things coming from you

16:40.000 --> 16:43.800
-I can't help you if I don't understand what I'm feeling
-I killed a man

16:46.600 --> 16:50.600
-What's your name?
-Julian boriqua

16:51.400 --> 16:54.800
I don't pretend to be a good man

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
-Who did you kill?
-Someone innocent

16:59.500 --> 17:04.000
We just pulled a robbery, and we were trying to get away

17:07.300 --> 17:09.900
Ok. All right. I didn't mean for it to happen

17:11.400 --> 17:14.500
There are a lot of things I never meant to do

17:27.200 --> 17:30.900
My partners were arrested,but I ran

17:31.200 --> 17:35.700
I knew my wife had moved away,but I managed to find her

17:36.100 --> 17:41.100
I saw my child, joseph,the son that I never knew

17:41.200 --> 17:45.300
And I thought maybe the three of us could start over

17:46.200 --> 17:49.300
But I lost rachel's love a long time ago

17:50.000 --> 17:52.600
She didn't want my son exposed to me

17:54.900 --> 17:58.100
I shouldn't have been surprised
when the police showed up at the house that night

17:59.300 --> 18:02.600
In prison, I started to see the truth

18:03.500 --> 18:10.600
I wasted my life.I hurt innocent people...and people who loved me

18:12.000 --> 18:17.600
And I made a promise that when I got out,
that I would start over clean

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
The day I was released, I was asked to do
a job on the outside.I refused

18:26.000 --> 18:33.700
My mind was on only one thing--
to find forgiveness and to begin again

18:33.800 --> 18:38.300
I truly believed that I could do this,
that I could make amends

18:49.300 --> 18:51.800
I was wrong

19:10.800 --> 19:12.700
Give us a hand.We need help in the back here

19:14.500 --> 19:19.000
I think that you're haunting my husband because
he was the last person you saw before you died

19:19.100 --> 19:21.500
No. It's because of you

19:22.500 --> 19:25.200
Is it your wife and son? Do you wanna see them again?

19:26.000 --> 19:29.300
No. Rachel doesn't even know I'm dead

19:29.800 --> 19:31.900
Then how can I help you?

19:32.000 --> 19:37.900
The day that I died,I was going to find the family of the man
that I killed,and I was gonna beg for forgiveness

19:40.400 --> 19:44.800
I wanna see that through now... with you

19:48.000 --> 19:50.200
Will you help me?

19:52.900 --> 19:55.400
I don't know if I can trust you

19:56.200 --> 19:59.700
-I've heard that you wanted to hurt your wife
-No!

20:03.500 --> 20:07.300
I never... I never...

20:08.000 --> 20:13.100
whoever told you that lied.I loved my wife.
I never wanted to harm her

20:14.000 --> 20:19.700
Look...I just need...would you please just believe me?

20:20.800 --> 20:22.800
You're my only hope

20:22.900 --> 20:25.700
Hey, honey,go ahead and plug in the space heater

20:27.000 --> 20:31.400
I got to rewire some of the circuits...is he here?

20:33.500 --> 20:37.900
Tell me what he wants.No, no.Tell me what you want!

20:43.800 --> 20:48.800
I'm sorry.This is not a benign spirit, ok?

20:49.000 --> 20:52.500
-Not after the stuff I've been feeling
-So maybe "benign" was a bad word

20:52.600 --> 20:56.400
But the man is obviously deeply unhappy,tortured,
and has had a horrible life

20:56.500 --> 20:59.200
That does not mean that there's not some spark of good in him

20:59.300 --> 21:03.700
Honey,I know you wanna believe that.
But this guys wants us to drive halfway across the state

21:03.800 --> 21:07.400
-and help him find the parents of the man he killed?
-Yeah, and that's exactly what we're gonna do

21:07.700 --> 21:09.800
How well do you think that is gonna go over,ok?

21:09.900 --> 21:12.500
when you tell them you represent the man who killed their son?

21:12.600 --> 21:14.900
I don't think it's gonna go over very well at all

21:15.200 --> 21:22.000
-But that is not a reason not to help him
-You know what? You are...you are as stubborn as...as A...

21:26.300 --> 21:28.100
me

21:32.400 --> 21:37.200
I just don't want this guy attached to me anymore or in my house

21:39.700 --> 21:43.000
I'm sorry. You're right

21:45.300 --> 21:48.500
You don't have another choice

21:51.000 --> 21:55.300
Hey.So you're an early-morning jogger, too?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.900
Uh, yeah.I just love this time of day

21:59.520 --> 22:03.400
When migs and i were in high school--
I really prefer to run by myself

22:03.500 --> 22:06.100
-Thanks
-Ok, then

22:11.300 --> 22:14.900
Look, I'm not trying to be a bitch

22:17.300 --> 22:22.300
I guess I'm just one of those people who thinks that
loyalty is a personal asset

22:23.200 --> 22:25.700
Uh, so it's about that costume party

22:25.900 --> 22:29.100
-God, I wish she'd get over that
-I don't know anything about a costume party

22:29.200 --> 22:33.300
It was a joke.Some kids decided to throw this costume party

22:33.400 --> 22:36.600
and everyone was supposed to come as their favorite fantasy

22:36.700 --> 22:39.600
At least that's what they told melinda

22:44.500 --> 22:47.500
So you humiliated her in front of her friends

22:47.600 --> 22:55.000
I...I kept her secret all through high school.
I was practically her only friend at her grandmother's funeral

22:55.100 --> 23:03.400
-I listened to all of her problems all the time.
-Alexis, that's just what friends do

23:09.000 --> 23:13.600
What a shame.Our first chance to get away,look what we're doing

23:13.700 --> 23:16.200
It's not exactly a romantic getaway, huh?

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
-Is he here?
-Yes.He seems very preoccupied

23:23.100 --> 23:27.200
Julian. Look, I just wanted to say I was sorry...

23:27.700 --> 23:31.000
for the way things went down on the night of the accident

23:31.100 --> 23:34.400
Tell him I know.I don't blame him

23:35.700 --> 23:37.500
He says he doesn't blame you

23:37.800 --> 23:41.000
-Thanks, julian.
-The truth is clear to me now

23:41.100 --> 23:45.400
This was all meant to happen because it led me to you

23:45.800 --> 23:48.500
Also to my salvation

23:52.000 --> 23:54.300
He says you're welcome

23:58.700 --> 24:01.000
-Uh, mrs. Farrell?
-Yes?

24:01.100 --> 24:04.500
Hi. My name is melinda gordon.This is my husband jim

24:04.600 --> 24:08.600
You don't know us,but we've recently became acquainted with...

24:10.300 --> 24:12.700
with someone who was familiar with your son

24:13.800 --> 24:16.600
Oh. I-I'm sorry.Who did you say you were?

24:16.700 --> 24:23.800
Melinda gordon. I...uh...I...

24:23.900 --> 24:26.500
My wife has a gift

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
Uh...and this is going to be kind of hard to explain.But...

24:31.100 --> 24:36.100
she has the ability to talk to and see people who have died

24:36.200 --> 24:39.000
-She can help them
-Wait a minute

24:39.200 --> 24:44.200
Are you telling me that...that you've been
in contact with my son?

24:44.300 --> 24:46.500
Actually, no.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.900
I've been in contact with the man who killed him

24:52.000 --> 24:53.200
Oh, my god

24:53.400 --> 24:55.500
He never meant to hurt your son

24:55.800 --> 25:02.700
-It was an accident.I would never take and he would never--
-doesn't matter

25:02.800 --> 25:07.300
I know I'm guilty.Because I'm the cause for their pain

25:08.200 --> 25:11.900
He was on his way to beg you
for your forgiveness when he was released

25:12.000 --> 25:17.600
-He was let out? Why didn't they tell us?
-I don't know.But he changed his thinking

25:17.700 --> 25:21.600
everything about the way he lived.
He wanted to start his life over

25:22.700 --> 25:25.400
-but it didn't work out that way
-Why not?

25:25.500 --> 25:27.000
He was killed...

25:28.500 --> 25:32.700
-The night he came to ask you to forgive him
-Don't tell them about my troubles

25:32.800 --> 25:35.700
You tell them that I would give anything...

25:37.000 --> 25:39.500
anything to bring back their son

25:39.600 --> 25:44.100
-You ok?
-Yeah. I'm fine. Go on. Tell them

25:44.500 --> 25:47.600
-He wishes that he could bring back your son
-That's enough

25:48.500 --> 25:50.600
-I have one question.
-Yes

25:50.800 --> 25:55.000
Why do we have to listen to him?
Why can't we talk to our son?

25:55.100 --> 26:02.300
Well, most likely,your son passed over easily
without issues to keep him earthbound

26:03.700 --> 26:09.500
Julian,on the other hand,is...
tortured by the memory of what he did

26:10.000 --> 26:11.600
Good

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
-I'm sorry?
-I'm glad he was tortured

26:15.800 --> 26:20.900
Does he have any idea how many times we wished we were dead?

26:21.800 --> 26:24.000
Just to stop the pain

26:24.200 --> 26:27.300
He was a good boy,our son.He...

26:28.000 --> 26:33.500
cared.He wanted to help people.He was going to build things.
He was going to make a difference

26:33.800 --> 26:37.000
And that's who that murderer took out of the world

26:37.300 --> 26:40.100
I believe him when he said that
the shooting was an accident

26:40.200 --> 26:46.300
He had a loaded gun.He pointed it.
It went off and killed our son

26:46.700 --> 26:49.100
What kind of an accident is that?

26:49.300 --> 26:56.000
And he wants forgiveness? From us?

26:58.500 --> 27:00.200
Never

27:05.500 --> 27:08.000
-Are you ok?
-Yeah

27:13.600 --> 27:16.300
-How's your headache?
-Better

27:17.000 --> 27:20.100
-That was horrible.
-I warned you

27:20.300 --> 27:22.800
I just feel so badly for the farrells

27:23.000 --> 27:25.800
-I can't imagine what they went through.
-What did you expect?

27:26.000 --> 27:28.600
Their only son was killed

27:32.000 --> 27:37.600
I'm sorry.I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm saying.I don't know who I am

27:37.700 --> 27:39.100
-Is he here?
-No

27:39.200 --> 27:43.100
It's like I'm infected with him or something.
Why is he still doing this to me?

27:43.200 --> 27:45.700
Because his energy's really powerful

27:46.200 --> 27:49.500
But I don't think that julian is an evil man, jim

27:49.700 --> 27:51.700
At least not anymore

27:51.900 --> 27:54.800
I just wish the farrells could have heard him speak

27:55.000 --> 27:57.600
It wouldn't have made any difference

28:04.200 --> 28:06.000
I know you see me

28:07.800 --> 28:09.600
Hello, alexis

28:10.000 --> 28:12.500
-You don't like me,do you?
-Does it matter?

28:12.600 --> 28:16.300
Look, you were right.
I shouldn't have told anyone about melinda's gift

28:16.500 --> 28:20.900
It was my first year at college.
I was desperately trying to fit in.And...

28:21.200 --> 28:23.300
you know how it is

28:23.500 --> 28:28.000
Ok, maybe you don't know how it is.
But that's how it was to me

28:29.300 --> 28:35.500
What I'm trying to say is...I wonder
if you could set up a meeting between me and melinda

28:36.000 --> 28:38.700
I know it's not easy to forgive sometimes

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Maybe just try to talk to her

28:52.000 --> 28:55.200
-what can I get you?
-I'll have a tuna sandwich

28:55.300 --> 28:56.600
What do you wanna order?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.500
Jim?

28:59.600 --> 29:02.900
-Jim
-I'm not hungry

29:03.000 --> 29:04.800
Well, you have to eat

29:05.700 --> 29:10.000
I am not hungry

29:14.100 --> 29:16.100
-Tell me what you're feeling
-It doesn't matter

29:16.200 --> 29:18.000
It does matter.I can help you

29:18.100 --> 29:25.800
I feel totally,completely alone.It doesn't matter who I'm with

29:26.000 --> 29:30.100
-And I feel like it will always be like this
-Those are not your feelings

29:30.300 --> 29:35.500
-You know that. They're his.
-They're strong

29:36.000 --> 29:41.300
I love you...so much.You know that?

29:43.400 --> 29:46.000
Well, then just focus on that

29:47.200 --> 29:49.700
Keep julian at a safe distance

29:50.000 --> 29:55.500
He just feels hopeless 'cause the farrells denied him.
And he feels lonely because...

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
-we have to find his wife and son
-No. We can't.We can't

30:05.500 --> 30:09.100
-It's beyond hope with them.
-It is not beyond hope with them

30:10.000 --> 30:15.400
Maybe if his wife knows that he's...dead,
she'll have a change of heart

30:15.500 --> 30:19.300
My wife hates me,and I don't blame her

30:21.400 --> 30:25.400
I betrayed her in every way that a husband can betray a wife

30:25.500 --> 30:31.900
-What about your son?
-I think about my son all the time

30:33.300 --> 30:36.500
Do you know...I didn't even try to know him

30:38.800 --> 30:41.400
Isn't it worth a try at forgiveness?

30:42.000 --> 30:51.100
I lost my son.And I don't have the right
to expect anything from him.Ok?

30:53.000 --> 30:59.300
Julian. You have to trust me when I say that there is hope

31:00.000 --> 31:07.200
I've been through it with others I've seen
how the lost of a loved one can affect the survivors

31:07.300 --> 31:12.800
But I don't care what you say.It is not beyond hope

31:23.100 --> 31:28.700
Julian,this is your chance, huh? You got to take it

31:34.200 --> 31:36.100
Ah, julian, come on

31:42.400 --> 31:44.200
Ok

31:56.000 --> 32:00.800
However this goes down,I just
wanted you to know that I respect what you do

32:01.000 --> 32:04.200
-I mean, this calling
-Jim--

32:06.000 --> 32:11.300
-and so if this doesn't go well--
hey. It's gonna go well.You're gonna be ok

32:17.100 --> 32:19.000
There

32:33.100 --> 32:34.700
Rachel

32:35.500 --> 32:39.400
Uh...excuse me.Rachel, hi

32:39.800 --> 32:43.900
My name is melinda gordon.This is my husband jim.
Can we talk to you for a few minutes?

32:44.000 --> 32:47.700
-How do you know my name?
-Through your husband,julian

32:49.100 --> 32:54.100
-What has that son of a bitch done now?
Oh, he hasn't done anything. He...

32:55.700 --> 32:59.200
except die

33:17.700 --> 33:23.300
Well, uh...I knew it would happen sooner or later

33:24.800 --> 33:29.800
-I guess it's sooner
-I told you this was a bad idea

33:29.900 --> 33:34.100
Um, he had some last words to share with you

33:34.200 --> 33:38.200
-You were with him when he died?
-No, but my husband was. It's

33:38.300 --> 33:42.300
It's more complicated than that.
Can we...can we please come in?

33:49.000 --> 33:52.300
Joseph? My son

33:59.000 --> 34:00.800
All...all grown up

34:05.200 --> 34:08.500
Just for a minute

34:14.000 --> 34:17.900
Ok, ok, back up here.You're telling me you're talking with julian?

34:18.100 --> 34:23.000
-Like his dead ghost or something?
-Yes -Even I feel his presence

34:23.100 --> 34:27.300
Oh, you feel his presence? Bet you've had a few sleepless nights

34:28.000 --> 34:34.500
Look, I left julian behind a long time ago.
I got a life. I got a job. I raise my son

34:34.600 --> 34:37.000
She can feel me.I can tell

34:37.900 --> 34:41.800
-Julian says that you can feel him
-I don't believe in that spirit stuff

34:41.900 --> 34:45.900
You did. When we went to see that fortune-teller on coney island

34:46.000 --> 34:49.900
-The one who told us that we were gonna get married
What about the fortune-teller at coney island?

34:51.600 --> 34:57.000
-Who told you about that?
Julian's telling me about it.Said it's the best day he can remember

34:57.100 --> 35:02.800
-You were so beautiful that day.Remember?
-Stop it

35:05.000 --> 35:10.900
-In you sundress and sandals.Did a sandal break?
Did he have to carry you? -Stop it!

35:11.000 --> 35:16.100
How do you know about that? You can't!You can't know that!

35:16.500 --> 35:19.700
-You tell her that I love her.
-He loves you

35:20.200 --> 35:24.000
-Tell her everything.
-And he's sorry for the pain he caused

35:28.000 --> 35:32.100
-Tell her that I deserved to die.
-I can't say that

35:33.000 --> 35:36.500
Say what? Tell me

35:36.600 --> 35:41.200
He said that...he deserved to die for hurting you

35:41.800 --> 35:43.300
and he can't hurt anyone anymore

35:43.400 --> 35:48.200
And tell her that I forgive her for turning me into the police

35:48.300 --> 35:52.100
-Tell her that she did the right thing.
-He says you did the right thing

35:52.200 --> 35:55.000
turning him into the police

35:56.300 --> 35:58.900
I didn't turn him in

35:59.500 --> 36:04.100
Is that what this is about?Are you trying to get me
to admit that I blew the whistle on my husband?

36:04.200 --> 36:08.900
-No. No. Julian thought--
-I don't care what he thought.I'm telling you

36:09.100 --> 36:11.200
I didn't turn julian in

36:12.300 --> 36:14.100
I did

36:19.500 --> 36:23.400
Joseph, you called the police on your father?

36:23.500 --> 36:26.800
-Why?
-Because I didn't want him making you miserable

36:27.400 --> 36:30.900
I couldn't stand to watch anymore,
but I didn't know he'd die

36:31.000 --> 36:33.700
I just wanted him to go away for a while

36:35.300 --> 36:37.800
-Joseph--
-don't touch me

36:38.300 --> 36:41.900
It's because of me he's dead

36:46.700 --> 36:48.700
What's happening?

36:49.300 --> 36:52.000
Uh, julian's laughing

36:53.200 --> 36:54.600
Why?

36:59.000 --> 37:02.800
Because it was my son who turned me in

37:06.300 --> 37:14.000
Not you, rachel. My son. Protecting his mother

37:15.300 --> 37:21.900
He's happy that you were protecting your mother.
He's telling you you did the right thing

37:22.200 --> 37:25.900
-That makes me wanna hug him
-You're lying

37:26.300 --> 37:29.500
-No, I'm not
-You see him?  -Yes

37:31.000 --> 37:33.200
Then what's behind his right ear?

37:33.800 --> 37:36.500
-What?
-Behind his right ear!

37:37.300 --> 37:40.900
He put a tattoo there that he said was for me
when I was born. what is it?

37:55.000 --> 38:00.100
It's a white dove. Wings outstretched

38:06.100 --> 38:08.300
What else does he say?

38:11.000 --> 38:16.400
He wants you to become the man he was trying to be--
to learn forgiveness

38:18.800 --> 38:22.300
-He says that being unforgiving...
-is like drinking poison

38:22.400 --> 38:27.200
Is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die

38:29.700 --> 38:33.700
-Ask rachel if she got my letters
-He's asking about some letters

38:35.100 --> 38:42.600
I didn't open them.I was mad at him

38:42.700 --> 38:44.100
Do you still have them?

38:44.500 --> 38:48.500
He wants you both to read them.
He said it'll help you understand

38:49.000 --> 38:54.600
Look at them--my beautiful wife and son

38:56.600 --> 39:00.900
I had it all. You know? And I just threw it away

39:01.000 --> 39:03.200
He's sorry that he threw your love away

39:03.400 --> 39:08.100
He didn't throw it away.Julian!

39:10.200 --> 39:16.500
Even though you tried. God knows when you went to jail, I tried

39:17.500 --> 39:21.500
But, damn it, I always loved you

39:23.500 --> 39:29.400
He needs to cross over now.
But he can't do that until he knows that you forgive him

39:34.200 --> 39:42.800
We do.We do forgive him

39:44.200 --> 39:50.600
And tell him...that I love him, too

39:53.600 --> 39:57.000
I wish there was something I could do

39:58.700 --> 40:02.600
Tell him there is something he can do

40:03.100 --> 40:10.800
Go to the parents of the man that I killed.
Find a way to befriend them.But don't tell them who you are

40:11.200 --> 40:16.000
Do good things for them.Make their lives easier

40:20.100 --> 40:24.300
Make a difference

40:28.600 --> 40:32.900
I'll tell him

40:37.400 --> 40:39.600
Jim?

40:53.000 --> 40:56.200
Is he gone?

41:13.000 --> 41:16.700
I am so glad andrea talked you into having this lunch with me

41:16.700 --> 41:19.000
Actually, andrea told me not to come

41:19.200 --> 41:24.100
-What?
-But it's been an extraordinary weekend,and, um...

41:25.000 --> 41:29.700
I've just been doing a lot of thinking about forgiveness
and what people do to each other

41:30.300 --> 41:35.000
Wow.That is so cool of you, migs

41:37.500 --> 41:42.400
So then now, I guess,would be a good time
for us to talk about what happened freshman year

41:42.500 --> 41:52.500
Oh.Migs, look...my thing...ah.
My thing is,don't dwell. You know?

41:53.000 --> 41:56.800
-Dwell?
-No matter what happened back then

41:57.000 --> 42:03.100
I totally, totally believe in what you can do.
In fact, it's why I'm here

42:03.600 --> 42:06.000
-What?
-Do you remember my aunt ruth?

42:06.400 --> 42:10.900
Kind of a pain in the butt, bad breath.She lived outside grand view

42:11.000 --> 42:17.200
She got sick last summer.I put in some long,
hard weekends with that woman toward the end

42:17.300 --> 42:23.400
And she totally promised me she was leaving me
this emerald necklace.Like real emerald,melinda

42:23.500 --> 42:26.000
with diamonds all around it and everything

42:26.100 --> 42:32.900
Anyway, she died.And guess what.No necklace.
I combed the entire house

42:33.000 --> 42:34.600
So I saw you. I thought...

42:35.300 --> 42:40.000
-what?
-Um, I suddenly feel much better

42:40.100 --> 42:44.300
Oh. Good.Good. You know, me, too

42:44.400 --> 42:50.200
'Cause I realize that what you did to me is nothing
compared to what you do to yourself every day

42:50.300 --> 42:53.900
And, um, it gives me some perspective. You know?

42:55.200 --> 43:01.000
Wow. Time has just...zoomed right by.I got to run

43:01.100 --> 43:08.800
Um, this was, uh, fun, lexi.And, um,
as far as the necklace goes.well, I would, uh...

43:12.200 --> 43:14.000
I would keep looking

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
