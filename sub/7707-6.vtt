WEBVTT

00:03.404 --> 00:06.605
And I get
two triple word scores.

00:07.274 --> 00:09.041
"Quidnunc?"

00:10.411 --> 00:12.244
[together]
Challenge!

00:12.246 --> 00:13.946
You've never heard quidnunc?

00:13.948 --> 00:16.815
- It's probably Melmacian.
- So?

00:16.817 --> 00:19.385
Well, you can't use
Melmacian words, ALF.

00:19.387 --> 00:22.054
- It's here.
- You're kidding.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.522
"Quidnunc..

00:23.524 --> 00:25.691
...one who enjoys gossip."

00:25.693 --> 00:29.995
Really? On Melmac,
it means one who wears meat.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.966
Two hundred
and forty-eight points.

00:33.968 --> 00:36.001
And it's my turn again.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.807
(Brian)
'"Quidnuncle?"'

00:41.809 --> 00:43.742
It's a relative who wears meat.

00:43.744 --> 00:46.011
[together]
Challenge!

00:46.013 --> 00:48.480
Rats.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.516
Brian, your hamster
flew the coop again.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.518
He's sleeping
in my left Reebok.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.586
I'll get him.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.655
[car horn honking]

00:56.657 --> 00:58.457
- Have fun, everyone.
- 'Bye.'

00:58.459 --> 01:00.159
Where are you going?

01:00.161 --> 01:01.360
Out.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.829
Out where? And with who?

01:03.831 --> 01:05.264
ALF.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.032
What kind of parents are you?

01:07.034 --> 01:09.701
The kind who trust
our 18-year-old daughter.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.236
Besides, we know
where she's going.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.771
She's going to the movies,
right, honey?

01:12.773 --> 01:14.406
- Right.
- What're you gonna see?

01:14.408 --> 01:15.874
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"

01:15.876 --> 01:18.977
"Unbearable Lightness of Being."

01:18.979 --> 01:22.247
Then you're gonna, uh, probably
stop off for pizza, huh?

01:22.249 --> 01:23.882
Sushi.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.252
Well, say hello
to Julie for us.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.587
Eddie.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.156
Happy now, ALF? Who's Eddie?

01:32.526 --> 01:35.060
Have we met Eddie?

01:35.062 --> 01:36.128
Well, no, of course not.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.863
I mean, this is only
our second date

01:37.865 --> 01:39.965
if you could even call it
a date, which I wouldn't--

01:39.967 --> 01:42.968
Is there some reason
we shouldn't meet this bozo?

01:43.671 --> 01:46.271
He is not a bozo.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.506
[doorbell dings]

01:47.508 --> 01:49.842
Send in the clown.

01:49.844 --> 01:52.778
Listen, I'll introduce
Eddie another time.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.781
Or you could bring him
in right now.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.650
Or I could bring him
in right now.

02:04.859 --> 02:06.825
Mom, dad..

02:07.595 --> 02:09.661
...this is Eddie.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.764
Hello, how are you?

02:12.766 --> 02:14.967
[ALF hums circus music]

02:18.205 --> 02:21.206
[theme music]

02:50.638 --> 02:53.839
[music continues]

03:19.833 --> 03:23.001
[instrumental music]

03:23.003 --> 03:25.737
Well, it's nice to meet you too.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.673
This is some great house.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.675
Good bones.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.277
Bones?

03:32.279 --> 03:35.781
Eddie was a graduate student
in architecture.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.051
Oh, what year was that?

03:39.053 --> 03:42.421
Let's see, that was just before
I started teaching.

03:42.423 --> 03:45.490
Eddie taught history
for a while.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.926
And lived a good deal of it,
I believe.

03:50.164 --> 03:52.264
Where did you meet, um..

03:52.266 --> 03:54.233
- Lynn.
- Lynn.

03:55.369 --> 03:58.003
I autographed a book for her
at the mall.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.972
[chuckles]
Oh, you're a writer.

03:59.974 --> 04:02.774
No, actually, I'm what they call
a substitute novelist.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.077
What I do is this,
I sign books for authors

04:05.079 --> 04:07.212
when they're too busy,
shall I show you?

04:07.214 --> 04:09.081
By all means.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.990
"Good luck, Lee Iacoca."

04:20.761 --> 04:23.262
I believe there's
another C

04:23.264 --> 04:25.697
in Iacocca.

04:25.699 --> 04:30.202
Yes, well, usually I have
the name right in front of me.

04:30.204 --> 04:33.138
Speaking of names, Eddie,
I didn't catch your last one.

04:33.140 --> 04:36.141
- He doesn't have one.
- Really?

04:37.378 --> 04:39.011
Well, I used to have one,
of course.

04:39.013 --> 04:42.614
- That's a relief.
- I dropped it a while back.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.817
I couldn't see
what purpose it served.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.287
Did you discuss this decision
with your mailman?

04:48.289 --> 04:51.790
[Eddie laughing]
Mailman.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.259
I love a guy
with a sense of humor.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.896
Would anyone like a soda?

04:57.898 --> 05:00.832
Absolutely. Diet, caffeine-free.
Thank you so much.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.635
Lynn, would you help me, please?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.971
Help you get one soda?

05:06.740 --> 05:09.441
Fine. Excuse me.

05:16.550 --> 05:19.151
Well, that's quite a girl
you've got there.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.054
We always thought so.

05:22.056 --> 05:24.756
Ever since the day she was born.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.459
Barely 18 years ago.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.731
Let me get right to the point.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.800
He's too old for you.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.369
- I knew you'd overreact--
- I am not..

05:37.371 --> 05:39.037
[clears throat]

05:39.039 --> 05:41.807
I am not overreacting.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.376
Let me take a look at this dude.

05:46.647 --> 05:47.979
Yikes!

05:47.981 --> 05:50.449
He's almost as old as Kate!

05:51.385 --> 05:53.251
Thanks a lot, ALF.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.091
You may have a moment of privacy
to tell Mr. Iacocca

05:59.093 --> 06:01.293
you won't be seeing him again.

06:01.295 --> 06:04.496
Unless it's for senior's night
at the Sizzler.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.966
[instrumental music]

06:09.269 --> 06:11.803
Mom, can I borrow
your black shoulder bag?

06:11.805 --> 06:13.205
Hmm. It's in my closet.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.440
- Thanks.
- Oh, sure.

06:15.442 --> 06:17.776
It's okay for her to borrow it.

06:19.246 --> 06:22.914
She seems to have gotten over
that Eddie guy pretty quickly.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.449
You know how girls are
at this age.

06:24.451 --> 06:27.219
Now, she's really attached
to this new boy Randy.

06:27.221 --> 06:30.922
- Not that he's not nice.
- He's a moron.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.692
He's not a moron.

06:33.694 --> 06:36.094
He's got no neck.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.163
The fact that he's muscular

06:38.165 --> 06:39.931
doesn't mean he's stupid.

06:39.933 --> 06:44.736
No, the fact that he's a cretin
means he's stupid.

06:44.738 --> 06:48.807
Although he did manage
to find the doorbell.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.243
(Lynn)
'Dad, will you let Randy in?'

06:51.245 --> 06:54.579
And hurry up before
he forgets why he's here.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.651
- Oh, hi, Randy.
- Hey.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.553
Come on in,
Lynn will be right out.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.088
Okay.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.362
I meant way in, Randy.

07:10.364 --> 07:13.532
Way, way over here.
Over to the couch.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.066
Okay.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.909
So, uh, how are things going
with the, uh, football team?

07:24.845 --> 07:26.411
Okay.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.449
Uh, what position
do you play again?

07:31.718 --> 07:32.984
Center.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.853
[chuckles]
Well, that's where the action is

07:34.855 --> 07:37.155
right-right in the middle.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.292
Uh-huh.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.933
Would you like some peanuts?

07:50.037 --> 07:52.404
Hi, Randy, how are you?

07:53.340 --> 07:54.873
Okay.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.310
What were you guys
talking about?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.279
Oh, just guy stuff.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.649
So where are you kids
going tonight?

08:06.153 --> 08:08.053
We're going
to Kathy Berry's house

08:08.055 --> 08:11.156
and, uh, we're late,
so, shall we?

08:11.658 --> 08:13.158
What?

08:13.760 --> 08:16.294
- Leave.
- Okay.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.699
[chuckles]
Don't be too late, honey.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.068
I won't. Night.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.139
He is a moron.

08:30.444 --> 08:32.444
Peanuts!

08:32.446 --> 08:34.212
Would you like some?

08:34.214 --> 08:36.114

08:46.927 --> 08:50.061
No! Don't go back
for that stupid cat.

This is no time for a snack.

[car door closes]

08:56.470 --> 08:59.070
Thanks, I had fun
watching you work.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.939
You must get writer's cramp.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.575
You know, I had no idea
that Donald Trump's book

09:03.577 --> 09:05.443
was quite so popular.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.341
[chuckles]
What're you doing?

09:36.343 --> 09:39.077
What am I doing?
What're you doing?

09:39.079 --> 09:41.313
What happened to Randy?

09:41.315 --> 09:43.448
That wasn't Randy, that was..

09:44.651 --> 09:46.384
...someone else.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.853
Yeah, someone who
looks like a certain

who shall remain last-nameless.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.431
Okay, so it was Eddie.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.533
He just happened
to be at the party, see--

10:01.535 --> 10:05.036
Yeah, yeah, and I just
fell off the garbanzo truck.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.839
Come on. This is the old ALFer.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.608
What gives?

10:09.610 --> 10:12.944
Okay. Okay.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.246
I haven't really been
dating Randy.

10:15.248 --> 10:18.283
I've only been tutoring him for
an hour in English each night

10:18.285 --> 10:20.552
and then going to meet Eddie.

10:20.554 --> 10:22.454
An hour a night?

10:22.456 --> 10:24.289
That's barely
enough time for Randy

10:24.291 --> 10:27.792
to turn his book right side up.

10:27.794 --> 10:31.029
ALF, please, don't tell mom
and dad about this yet, okay?

10:31.031 --> 10:32.263
I know they'll like Eddie.

10:32.265 --> 10:35.166
They just need
some time to adjust.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.136
Don't tell them?

10:38.138 --> 10:40.338
- You want me to lie?
- No!

10:40.340 --> 10:42.307
No, you don't have to lie.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.576
Just don't bring it up.

10:44.578 --> 10:46.344
That's not lying.

10:46.346 --> 10:49.180
Egad. What a loophole.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.550
It's not like
I'm never gonna tell them.

10:52.552 --> 10:55.887
I just.. I need to wait
for the right moment.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.723
You know, like, when they're
in a really, really good mood.

10:58.725 --> 11:01.092
Yeah, well, let me know
when that happens

11:01.094 --> 11:03.228
and I'll tell 'em
about the untimely demise

11:03.230 --> 11:06.264
of Kate's porcelain ballerina.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.300

mom's porcelain ballerina?

11:09.803 --> 11:10.969
Yeah.

It's 9:05,
past somebody's bedtime.

Oh, no fair!

11:33.393 --> 11:36.594

"Curse of the Moon People."

11:37.664 --> 11:39.964
I was talking to Brian.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.167
I knew that. Hit the hay, Bri.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.302
Goodnight, B.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.204
I'll come tuck you
in a few minutes, honey.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.340
Mom, I'm old enough
to tuck myself in.

11:50.777 --> 11:52.143
Oh.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.045
Oh, I understand.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.815
But you can still
read me a story.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.117
Okay.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.490
Gee, they grow up so fast.

12:05.492 --> 12:08.460
Pretty soon he's not gonna
need us for anything.

12:09.863 --> 12:12.163
I'll always need you guys.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.400
We know.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.368

12:19.673 --> 12:21.206
Oh.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.580
- Oh, hello, Randy.
- Hey.

12:29.483 --> 12:32.517
- Where's Lynn?
- Huh?

12:34.020 --> 12:36.755
Our daughter. Lynn!

12:36.757 --> 12:38.456
Isn't she with you?

12:41.628 --> 12:43.228
No.

12:44.397 --> 12:47.332
She said she was going
over to your house.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.301
Oh. Okay.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.473
What's going on?

12:55.475 --> 12:57.108
[sighs]
I-I don't know.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.078
Yo-you think there could've
been a mix-up between them?

13:00.080 --> 13:01.312
Well, honey,
if it was just a mix-up

13:01.314 --> 13:04.349
she'd be home by now
or call at least.

You think I should
go look for her?

(Kate)
'Oh, honey,
where would you look?'

13:08.622 --> 13:11.623
Who knows where
she could've gone?

13:11.625 --> 13:13.625
Yeah, you know,
it's not like Lynn

13:13.627 --> 13:16.027
to change her plans
and not call us.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.695
- Yeah.
- Wait a minute.

13:17.697 --> 13:21.699
You're getting carried away.
Lynn's just fine.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.268
How do you know?

13:23.270 --> 13:25.770
Well...well, she's, uh..

13:25.772 --> 13:28.039
Um, well,
I don't, I don't know for sure.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.141
ALF?

13:30.143 --> 13:33.278
I don't suppose you could
just trust me on this one?

13:35.148 --> 13:36.948
I didn't think so.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.385
Come on, ALF, where is she?

13:40.387 --> 13:43.354
I can't tell you.
I said I wouldn't tell you.

13:43.356 --> 13:47.292
- Tell us what?
- That Lynn's seeing Eddie.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.529
Eddie?

13:53.767 --> 13:55.800
You tricked me.

13:55.802 --> 13:58.136
She's been lying to us.

13:58.138 --> 14:01.906
Not exactly.
It's a loophole.

14:01.908 --> 14:04.943
I can't believe that Lynn
would do something like this.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.477
Well, look at the bright side.

14:06.479 --> 14:09.314
At least she's dating
a guy with a neck.

14:11.117 --> 14:14.619
- Hi, everyone.
- You're grounded, lady!

14:14.621 --> 14:17.355
- What for?
- Eddie.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.195
You know, it was
the funniest thing--

14:24.197 --> 14:25.864
Please!

14:29.202 --> 14:33.404
Thank you...for ratting on me.

It's not from me.
I'm just the bellhop.

It's from a friend of yours.

You didn't do anything wrong.

I never thought I would say.

Lynn's little subterfuge

I was dating Willie

before I told
my parents about it.

How come?

Oh, Willie didn't have any money

and he didn't have a job, and..
