came early today.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.236

Bartokomous, I need to know
if you've seen a memo

02:09.195 --> 02:10.363
from accounting to payroll.

02:10.395 --> 02:13.333
It was about a claim I put in
for reimbursement for gas.

02:13.366 --> 02:16.436
Oh, yes. I just sent that up
right before Mrs. Ganz's memo.

02:16.469 --> 02:19.706

I don't suppose
you read that memo, did you?

02:19.740 --> 02:21.174
No. No, I didn't.

I think, I think I have what
they call a pornographic memory.

You know, Bartokomous, I
probably don't tell you this

02:38.592 --> 02:40.761

you're doin' a terrific job.

I could get for my Mustang...

milk for your morning coffee

‐ Isn't that the worst?

09:13.186 --> 09:17.891

09:17.924 --> 09:19.726
The timing is lousy.

09:24.698 --> 09:25.799

make the payments.

doesn't meet for two weeks.

10:58.725 --> 11:00.360

that I have a code.

who are running for president.

I made a mistake

11:36.229 --> 11:38.198
telling Mr. Gorpley
about the memo today

11:38.231 --> 11:40.767
but I've learned my lesson.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.102
Oh.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.336
Oh.

11:43.369 --> 11:47.007
Now I see what the problem is.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.342

of difference

11:49.375 --> 11:51.044

11:52.178 --> 11:54.815

12:11.998 --> 12:14.000
...it's perfectly alright...

12:14.034 --> 12:15.502

You see, cousin,
no matter who I tell

12:34.888 --> 12:36.557
it would be violating my code.

12:36.590 --> 12:40.160
Uh, hey, Balki. Balki. Balki!

12:40.193 --> 12:42.495
It's not like my raise
is a big secret.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.798
I'll find out about it
in a couple of days anyway.

12:44.831 --> 12:48.034
But... darn it

12:48.068 --> 12:51.104
I don't have a couple of days.

12:51.137 --> 12:54.374
That car will be gone
by 9 o'clock tonight.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.509
Cousin, I'm sorry.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.912
But there's just no way
I can tell you about your raise.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.081
Asking a Mypiot
to give up his code

13:01.114 --> 13:04.384
is like asking a tsetse fly
to give up his tsetse.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.591
‐ There's really no way?
‐ No, there's no way.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.293
Nothing I could do or say
would change your mind?

13:13.326 --> 13:15.028
Absolutely nothing.

13:15.061 --> 13:18.398
'Cause I wouldn't stoop so low
as to offer you money.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.906
I'm glad to hear that.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.410
I wouldn't dream of
offering you something...

13:32.012 --> 13:33.079
...sweet.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.350
Hmm?

13:39.385 --> 13:41.321
Cousin, don't do this.

13:43.524 --> 13:47.594
Something like
a Sears Tower sundae.

13:48.662 --> 13:51.565
Tallest sundae known to man.

13:51.598 --> 13:55.001
A mountain of double fudge

13:55.035 --> 13:57.571
almond nut ice cream

13:57.604 --> 14:01.341
running with
rivers of hot caramel

14:02.475 --> 14:05.478
and topped with mounds
of whipped cream

14:05.512 --> 14:08.081
and cherries and cherries...

14:08.114 --> 14:10.483
...as many cherries as you want.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.586
It could be yours, Balki.

14:12.619 --> 14:15.388
It could be yours.
And not just tonight.

14:15.421 --> 14:18.124
Every night for a month.

14:18.158 --> 14:22.228
And all you have to do
is just... tell me.

14:24.631 --> 14:28.034
Tell me if I got my raise.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.972
I can't! I can't!

14:46.319 --> 14:48.054
[knocks]
Balki?

14:50.156 --> 14:52.626
I was way out of line.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.127
Balki.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.029
I‐I owe you an apology.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.898
Open the door, p‐please.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.372
I'm sorry.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.375
I am so, so sorry.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.283
I am trying to get you
to break your code

15:17.317 --> 15:19.019
and you won't, why?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.688
Because you have
too much integrity

15:21.722 --> 15:23.489
and, hey...

15:23.524 --> 15:25.058
...I respect you for it.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.430
Why don't we just
forget the whole thing

15:30.463 --> 15:32.165
and get on with our lives.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.667
‐ Really?
‐ Really.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.702
I won't mention it again.

15:35.736 --> 15:38.371
Oh. Oh, cousin. Oh, thank you.

15:38.404 --> 15:42.075
T‐that would be such
a big load off my spine.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.045
‐ Ah.
‐ Ah.

15:47.748 --> 15:48.682
Ah.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.085
Ah!

15:53.419 --> 15:55.388
So... what do you wanna do?

15:56.456 --> 15:58.391
‐ Watch a little TV?
‐ Well..

15:58.424 --> 16:00.260
‐ Go to a movie?
‐ Nah.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.595
Or we could talk.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.533
You know, it's funny.

16:08.635 --> 16:12.172
Sometimes... the little things

16:12.205 --> 16:14.474
can change a person's
whole life.

16:14.508 --> 16:16.577
Oh, boy, don't I know it.

16:16.610 --> 16:18.078
Now, take me for instance.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.681
Better yet, take the example
of my cousin, Christos.

16:20.714 --> 16:22.248
‐ When Christos was just a‐‐
‐ I'm just about to‐‐

16:22.282 --> 16:24.651
‐ I'm just about to have the‐‐
‐ When Christos‐‐

16:24.685 --> 16:26.486
‐ When Christos‐‐
‐ I'm just about to have the‐‐

16:26.520 --> 16:27.453
When...

16:31.357 --> 16:33.493
When, uh...
my Cousin Christos...

16:33.527 --> 16:35.295
...when he was about
eight years old...

16:35.328 --> 16:38.098
...he got, uh,
kicked in the head by a goat

16:38.131 --> 16:41.401
and, uh...
we didn't think that much of it

16:41.434 --> 16:44.170
because who hasn't been
kicked in the head by a goat.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.809
Anyway, uh, when he grew up

16:48.842 --> 16:50.544
he started to have these
terrible headaches

16:50.577 --> 16:54.147
And, uh, it was just awful.
I mean, he couldn't sleep

16:54.180 --> 16:56.316
he couldn't eat,
he couldn't work.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.384
And nobody knew what to do.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.754
And then finally it hit me.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.189
I said, I said, Christos

17:03.223 --> 17:05.157
that hat that you've been
wearing since you were

17:05.191 --> 17:07.761
eight years old and the
goat kicked you in the head.

17:07.794 --> 17:10.195
Take it off.
It's just too small.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.135
So, anyway...

17:16.569 --> 17:19.271
...t‐to make
a short story long, he did.

17:19.305 --> 17:22.407
And, uh, it just, it made
a world of difference.

17:22.442 --> 17:23.544
And, uh...

17:24.877 --> 17:28.481
...today... Christos is the
sergeant general of Mypos.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.320
Fascinating.

17:38.592 --> 17:40.661
Fascinating, now...

17:40.694 --> 17:44.497
...let's...
take what's happened to me.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.801
Now, I‐I won't be getting
the car of my dreams.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.671
So what, you may say. I mean,
It happens to a lot of people.

17:50.704 --> 17:54.541
But... let's take
a look into the future.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.545
Oh, look.

17:58.579 --> 17:59.546
Wait.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.414
Who is that? Why...

18:01.447 --> 18:03.850
It's Larry Appleton, but...

18:03.884 --> 18:06.820
...why is he sleeping
on a park bench

18:06.853 --> 18:08.454
covered with newspaper?

18:08.488 --> 18:09.723
What happened to him?

18:11.592 --> 18:12.826
I don't know.

18:15.461 --> 18:16.863
His back is to me.

18:23.604 --> 18:24.738
Well, they say it started

18:24.771 --> 18:26.306
when he got the chance

18:26.339 --> 18:28.408
to get the car of his dreams

18:28.441 --> 18:29.409
and couldn't take it.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.811
Why? I think we all know why.

18:32.846 --> 18:34.881
He was never the same
after that.

18:34.915 --> 18:39.219
He spent all his time going from
one used car lot to another.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.287
The dealers said they'd find him
another Austin Healey

18:41.321 --> 18:42.523
but they didn't.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.359
And it was all
downhill from there.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.763
He lost his job...

18:51.898 --> 18:53.199
...his friends...

18:54.868 --> 18:57.403
...and finally his will to live.

19:00.406 --> 19:01.675
Oh, my Lord.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.277
What is it?

19:05.712 --> 19:07.447
Well, he just
rolled off the park bench.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.316
I... I think
he stopped breathing.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.285
Cousin, don't die.
You're getting a raise.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.287
‐ Are you sure?
‐ Of course I'm...

19:19.860 --> 19:22.829
Thanks, Balki. You saved a life.

19:40.313 --> 19:43.249
Uh, are you gonna buy it or you
gonna tear up the sign again?

19:44.618 --> 19:46.653
‐ I'm ready to buy.
‐ Fine.

19:46.687 --> 19:48.221
I'll go get the paperwork.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.736
[instrumental music]

20:44.044 --> 20:47.347
May I ask why you're
sitting in the fireplace?

20:51.618 --> 20:53.286
Because I am disgraced.

20:56.022 --> 20:59.726
And when I am disgraced
I have to sit among the ashes.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.965
Oh, right. That's one
of those Mypos things.

21:09.703 --> 21:10.771
Balki...

21:11.772 --> 21:13.306
...I didn't buy the car.

21:15.075 --> 21:16.743
You didn't?

21:16.777 --> 21:17.744
No.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.415
Something happened when
I got to the used car lot.

21:23.884 --> 21:26.452
And this afternoon
that car looked...

21:26.486 --> 21:28.021
...all soft and blurry.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.523
It kind of glowed.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.491
Like Cybill Shepherd
does on "Moonlighting?"

21:34.561 --> 21:35.495
Exactly.

21:37.363 --> 21:38.464
But tonight...

21:39.533 --> 21:40.767
...after what I did to you...

21:41.902 --> 21:43.570
...everything changed.

21:43.604 --> 21:47.473
Suddenly, it just
looked like an old car.

21:47.508 --> 21:51.612
I realized I'd put that
stupid car above our friendship.

21:51.645 --> 21:52.746
Oh, cousin.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.887
You didn't buy the car
because of our friendship?

22:00.921 --> 22:02.889
Yeah. I couldn't.

22:03.824 --> 22:04.925
Pretty dumb, huh?

22:04.958 --> 22:07.528
No, cousin. I'm proud of you.

22:07.561 --> 22:09.029
Proud of me?

22:09.062 --> 22:11.431
I made you violate your code.

22:11.464 --> 22:14.467
Well... yeah, you did

22:14.500 --> 22:17.403
but... I didn't even know
I had that code

22:17.437 --> 22:18.772
until you told me about it.

22:20.473 --> 22:21.775
Oh, yeah, I'm great at, at

22:21.808 --> 22:23.710
pointing out codes
to other people

22:23.744 --> 22:25.746
I just don't
live by them myself.

22:25.779 --> 22:26.947
Yes, you do.

22:26.980 --> 22:28.582
You live by a code.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.917
It just takes a while
for it to kick in.

22:32.586 --> 22:34.154
I just wish
it would kick in sooner

22:34.187 --> 22:36.590
so I wouldn't feel
like such a jerk.

22:36.623 --> 22:38.091
You are not a jerk.

22:39.793 --> 22:41.595
‐ I'm not?
‐ No.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.096
You're, you're tricky...

22:43.129 --> 22:44.430
...and devious...

22:44.464 --> 22:45.832
...and a lousy bargainer...

22:45.866 --> 22:48.168
...but...

22:48.201 --> 22:49.836
...you're not a jerk.

22:50.637 --> 22:51.638
Thanks.

22:51.672 --> 22:55.609
Cousin, I‐I want to
do something to cheer you up.

22:55.642 --> 22:58.111
Um... what can I offer you?

22:59.045 --> 23:00.814
Perhaps something sweet?

23:03.650 --> 23:05.752
Why don't we go get
a Sears Tower sundae?

23:05.786 --> 23:07.754
‐ I'll buy.
‐ No, no.

23:07.788 --> 23:10.423
I'm the tricky, devious one.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.192
‐ I'll buy.
‐ No. No, cousin. Let me buy.

23:12.225 --> 23:15.128
‐ No, I should buy‐‐
‐ Oh, please. Please let me‐‐

23:15.161 --> 23:16.096
Look!

23:23.036 --> 23:25.471
I want you to be cheerful.

23:27.541 --> 23:28.909
I'll buy.

23:31.745 --> 23:32.679
Okay.
