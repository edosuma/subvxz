00:09.927 --> 00:12.178
There's something on the
Baseship that can help.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.721
It's this organic resin.

00:13.806 --> 00:15.306
It'll grow into the metal.

00:15.391 --> 00:17.350
It strengthens
it as it matures.

00:17.434 --> 00:21.187
Oh, my Gods.
That's Ellen Tigh.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.106
Nice to see you again.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.315

Up all bunks and turn to.

01:00.811 --> 01:03.062
Sweep down all compartments.

01:03.147 --> 01:05.273

and the week
before that.

02:10.464 --> 02:14.008
We'll be flying Viper CAPs in
conjunction with heavy Raider pickets

02:14.092 --> 02:15.718

02:15.803 --> 02:19.472
Those of you who just came
back from six-day planet hunts

02:19.556 --> 02:23.017

02:23.894 --> 02:26.938
Remember, the first one
who sights a habitable rock

02:27.022 --> 02:30.900
will get this fine
oral hygiene product.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.529
It is the last tube of Tauron

And the week
before that.

STARBUCK: Planet-hunters, make sure
to draw long-duration provisions.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.962
If those clapped-out FTLs go
down when you're out there,

02:51.046 --> 02:54.465
you're gonna get mighty hungry
waiting for the SAR birds to find you.

02:54.550 --> 02:57.885
As you know, the mutiny
has thinned our ranks.

02:57.970 --> 03:02.056
We cannot give all you

03:04.518 --> 03:06.143
But do not whack too much.

conserve your O2.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.356

your alone time.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.733
Wank as little as
possible. Conserve your O2.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.904
Planet search assignments
are on the duty board.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.447
Be advised the
repairs to Galactica

03:18.532 --> 03:21.576
will continue to cause
sporadic power outages.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.624

Good hunting.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.755
So, the stop-drilling
and the shoring compound

03:34.840 --> 03:36.591
will buy the Galactica

03:36.675 --> 03:39.302
a few more jumps,
but not many.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.013
How many?

03:42.097 --> 03:45.474
TYROL: Impossible to say.
Till the hull caves in.

03:45.934 --> 03:49.270
But we're not ready to give
up on the old girl just yet.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.357
APOLLO: Well, if there's
nothing else. Sonia,

03:54.651 --> 03:56.861
I wanna congratulate
you on your election.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.613
I look forward to seeing
you taking your seat

03:58.697 --> 04:00.823
in the Quorum of ships'
captains next week.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.951
Thank you. But you
should know something.

04:04.036 --> 04:06.495
When we convene, I
intend to formally request

04:06.580 --> 04:10.625
that the Eight you're holding in
Galactica's brig be returned to us.

04:11.627 --> 04:14.211
Boomer?
Yes. Sharon Valerii.

04:14.296 --> 04:16.339
She put two holes in me.

04:16.715 --> 04:19.091
I'm afraid I didn't
word that right.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.927
We don't want
Boomer set free.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.970
We want to try
Boomer for treason.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.727
Sharon Valerii sided with
Cavil in the Cylon Civil War,

04:29.811 --> 04:31.896
which killed thousands of our comrades.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.857
APOLLO: And if
she's convicted?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.443
Before the civil war,

04:37.527 --> 04:39.946
resurrection made capital
punishment pointless.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.281
But now that
we're all mortal...

04:42.366 --> 04:44.241
You want to kill her.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.444

06:01.528 --> 06:03.571
And they haven't
changed in weeks.

he's having any kind
of conscious thought.

rebooting, reorganizing as it heals.

need is you jerking our chains

06:14.249 --> 06:16.000
with a lot of quack ideas.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.961
So why don't you take
them someplace else?

06:20.630 --> 06:23.466
ATHENA: What if we could link him
to the data stream like our hybrids?

06:23.550 --> 06:26.052
His eyes were
closed last time.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.220
COTTLE: Well, that's
not unusual in a coma.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.222
Doesn't mean anything.

get on with your life.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.783
Point?

07:32.327 --> 07:34.286
The point is to bring a
little grace and beauty

17:19.122 --> 17:21.373
And I will testify
to that at her trial.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.250
But I won't
try to stop it.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.961
We have to let justice run its course.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.340
Then they will kill her.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.218
Sure as hell.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.637
We're all in hell.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.600
Thanks for your
input, Colonel.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.436
He just lost his child,
for God's sake.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.271
You leave him be.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.783
How long have you
been going there?

17:59.537 --> 18:00.787
A while.

18:01.706 --> 18:04.291
Became my
secret retreat.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.210
A way of feeling
close to you.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.382
(LAUGHS) Do
you remember

18:12.925 --> 18:15.719
how we obsessed over
every little detail?

18:18.389 --> 18:22.976
That was you obsessing,
I was just

18:24.854 --> 18:26.188
listening.

18:26.564 --> 18:29.357
Really? How many floor
plans did you draw?

18:31.194 --> 18:33.153
That's being thorough.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.238
(CHUCKLES) Oh.

18:38.534 --> 18:39.951
We never had a chance
to build our house,

18:40.036 --> 18:42.037
so I built it
in my head.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.624
And I wanted so much
to share it with you.

19:02.225 --> 19:05.560
Are you sure? I don't want
to put you through any...

Now, what about
the second?

21:02.720 --> 21:04.387
(LAUGHS)
I got nothing.

21:04.472 --> 21:05.764
(LAUGHS)

21:05.848 --> 21:07.766
It's okay. It's just
the next hurdle.

21:07.850 --> 21:10.018
The key is to,
you know, not panic.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.190
Trust yourself,
something's gonna come.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.860
It's part of
the process.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.951
Is part of the process also
stealing from other composers?

21:26.035 --> 21:27.452
That piece you're
riffing off of,

21:27.536 --> 21:30.038
it's Nomion's 3rd
Sonata, Second Movement.

21:33.209 --> 21:36.169
I mean, it's what it
sounded like, anyway.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.171
No, you're dead
on the money.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.173
It's pronounced
Nomion.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.176
Anyway, he's
my touchstone.

21:43.260 --> 21:46.638
Whenever I come up dry, I
look to him for inspiration.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.598
And for somebody who
hates music so much,

21:48.683 --> 21:50.850
you know an awful
lot about it.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.229
My dad used to play.

21:55.189 --> 21:56.690
Ah!

21:57.400 --> 21:59.109
So what's the story?

21:59.193 --> 22:00.860
He forced you to learn?

22:00.945 --> 22:04.489
And he was such a perfectionist,
you grew to hate it?

22:04.573 --> 22:05.573
No.

22:06.909 --> 22:08.910
No, I loved it,
actually.

22:12.248 --> 22:15.208
He used to sit me next to him
on the bench when he played.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.377
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

22:17.461 --> 22:19.796
Smell of tobacco
on his breath.

22:22.717 --> 22:24.843
He taught me
a few songs.

22:24.927 --> 22:27.554
I used to try so hard to get them right.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.139
Not because I was
afraid he'd get angry,

22:29.223 --> 22:30.765
but because I knew
he'd be so proud.

22:30.850 --> 22:31.975
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

22:32.768 --> 22:35.812
There was this one
song that he taught me.

22:36.689 --> 22:40.442
It made me feel happy and
sad all at the same time.

For the first
time in my life.

24:15.704 --> 24:18.748
I knew what I was doing
and why I was here.

Now, I'm just
adrift again.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.391

know your direction,

doesn't mean you

You need to
clear your head.

You don't have
to kill her.

25:15.431 --> 25:16.681
Leave her
in the brig.

25:16.765 --> 25:17.932
No. Uh-uh.

She didn't leave me.
I left her.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.885
Why?

27:21.223 --> 27:23.933
She wanted me to quit playing the piano.

38:06.493 --> 38:08.661
Six, get a med team here
right frakking now. Yes, sir.

38:08.745 --> 38:11.956
Get on the horn to CIC and
let them know Boomer's loose.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.248
She's got my frakking kid.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.583

BOOMER: LSO, Athena, what's the
delay with my flight clearance?

38:32.394 --> 38:34.186
LSO: Please hold,
Raptor 719.

38:34.270 --> 38:36.563
Looks like we're still waiting for
traffic to clear your flight path.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.691
Stand by for
instructions.

38:42.737 --> 38:43.946
Come on.

38:46.074 --> 38:47.658
(COMPUTER BEEPS)

38:47.742 --> 38:50.661
She's not buying it.
She initiated prestart.

38:51.413 --> 38:53.080
Boomer, this is
Galactica Actual.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.166
Return to checkers
red and shut down.

38:56.251 --> 38:57.334

Blue Leader,
Galactica Immediate.

39:11.891 --> 39:13.308
Proceed directly
to Galactica.

39:13.393 --> 39:16.895
Engage Raptor 219.
Weapons free.

39:17.731 --> 39:20.065
HOTDOG: Blue flight,
rolling in hot.

39:20.150 --> 39:24.611
If you launch, Boomer,
I will shoot you down.

39:24.696 --> 39:28.198
I don't think you want to do
that while I have Hera onboard.

39:31.786 --> 39:33.704
We can't let her
get off this ship!

39:33.788 --> 39:35.789
Retract the
flight pods.

39:39.127 --> 39:41.295
Sir, she's spooling
to jump.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.255
If she jumps
inside the ship,

39:43.339 --> 39:46.633
the spatial disruption could
tear Galactica's guts out.

39:47.260 --> 39:49.094
Retract the flight pods.

39:49.179 --> 39:52.598
Retract flight pods. I say
again, retract flight pods.

(RUMBLING)

41:30.697 --> 41:32.531
I need a team,
scaffolding

41:32.615 --> 41:34.992
and shoring compound to the
forward magazine right away.

41:35.076 --> 41:36.493
DEALINO: One Eight
looks like another.

41:36.578 --> 41:39.246
ATHENA: How did a three-year-old
girl get by you, though?

41:39.330 --> 41:40.539
What the hell is
going on up there?

41:40.623 --> 41:42.416
Boomer took her kid.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.169
What?
She took Hera.

41:45.253 --> 41:46.628
Just walked right
out of the daycare.

41:46.713 --> 41:49.673
ATHENA: How the hell do you let a
three-year-old girl climb into a Raptor?

41:49.757 --> 41:51.175
How does she
get by you?

41:51.259 --> 41:53.427
DEALINO: I'm sorry, sir.
But nobody saw your daughter.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.596
HELO: That's impossible.
Somebody saw her.

41:55.680 --> 41:56.930
She's a
three-year-old child.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.640
Explain to me how
you didn't see her.

41:58.725 --> 42:02.686
Had to be orchestrated from the
beginning. My escape, all of it.

42:02.770 --> 42:05.606
I was just a means
to get Boomer here.

42:06.107 --> 42:09.359
Cavil wanted Hera.
Boomer got her for him.

42:11.279 --> 42:15.657
How can a three-year-old girl
spontaneously write down that song?

42:16.618 --> 42:20.287
She's plugged into something
that's manipulating all of us.

42:21.789 --> 42:24.458
Maybe Anders
could help us.

42:26.544 --> 42:28.295
