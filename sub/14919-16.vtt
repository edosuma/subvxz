WEBVTT

00:02.797 --> 00:05.820
Hey, sorry we're late.
My support group went over.

00:05.821 --> 00:07.822
At ease.
We don't open for another hour.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.754
I'm gonna go get my apron,
then I'm all yours.

00:11.354 --> 00:13.913
So you picked up Zach again
from his meeting. That was nice.

00:13.914 --> 00:16.202
Yeah, well, the, uh, the bus
takes twice as long,

00:16.245 --> 00:18.643
and I figured while I was here,
I'll hang Olivia's shelves.

00:18.644 --> 00:21.125
Oh, you don't have to do that.
Kevin will be back any minute.

00:22.289 --> 00:24.353
- Kevin?
- Yeah. He's all handy now.

00:24.354 --> 00:25.857
I showed him how to use a glue gun.

00:26.134 --> 00:27.782
Right. Uh, where's the toolbox?

00:28.439 --> 00:29.449
Underneath the sink.

00:29.450 --> 00:30.506
Great.

00:32.411 --> 00:33.721
All right. 
I'm officially on the clock.

00:33.722 --> 00:34.328
- Where do you need me?
- Uh,

00:34.329 --> 00:35.921
why don't you help Dennis
with the salad Greens?

00:35.922 --> 00:37.190
- You got it, boss.
- Great.

00:40.770 --> 00:42.545
Hey. Thanks a lot, Scotty,
for helping him out.

00:42.546 --> 00:43.762
I really appreciate it.

00:43.842 --> 00:45.829
I wish all my employees
had his work ethic.

00:45.830 --> 00:48.314
If you can chauffer him around,
let him sleep on your couch,

00:48.315 --> 00:49.466
it's the least I can do.

00:50.554 --> 00:51.706
How do you think he's doing?

00:52.438 --> 00:54.493
Good, I think.
Yeah, I think it's good for him

00:54.494 --> 00:56.521
to have the routine, camaraderie.

00:56.706 --> 00:58.698
I think he misses it,
you know, the marines?

00:59.063 --> 01:01.110
I think he's happy to have
structure in his life again.

01:02.421 --> 01:04.676
- Uh, where are the shelves?
- Uh, upstairs, Olivia's room.

01:04.706 --> 01:06.290
- Olivia's room. Got it.
- Thank you.

01:07.661 --> 01:08.941
Paige, you ready for lunch?

01:08.942 --> 01:10.878
It's just grilled cheese,
I know, but it's good.

01:14.030 --> 01:16.638
I know. I know. He asked me.

01:16.942 --> 01:18.098
Are you okay?

01:18.099 --> 01:20.491
Yeah, can I borrow that
dress that you have,

01:20.763 --> 01:21.897
the burgundy one?

01:22.170 --> 01:24.107
Okay. Yeah, 
I'll figure something out.

01:24.678 --> 01:26.151
Okay, I'll call you back.

01:27.545 --> 01:30.274
Okay, so I take this as a good scream,
not a bad scream.

01:30.275 --> 01:33.267
Yeah. I mean, the good ones
are always higher pitched.

01:33.662 --> 01:34.705
What's so exciting?

01:34.706 --> 01:38.801
Well, this boy I like... Cody.
He... he asked me to a dance.

01:38.802 --> 01:39.945
That's great.

01:39.946 --> 01:43.465
Yeah, but it's tomorrow night.
Is that okay?

01:43.466 --> 01:45.075
You and I were gonna go to a movie.

01:45.076 --> 01:48.902
Your mother is out of town,
Cooper is staying with your dad,

01:49.098 --> 01:51.305
and we had a whole weekend
of fun planned.

01:51.878 --> 01:53.686
Now I have to stay here alone?

01:53.721 --> 01:56.250
- I will probably cry.
- Stop it.

01:56.251 --> 01:58.473
Okay, who is this Cody?
Never heard of him.

01:58.921 --> 02:01.209
Well, he hasn't really
paid attention to me

02:01.210 --> 02:02.386
up until now,

02:02.387 --> 02:04.083
but I'm freaking out.

02:07.157 --> 02:08.933
Um, there's one more thing.

02:08.934 --> 02:12.329
Ah, I knew it.
You want me to teach you some salsa,

02:12.330 --> 02:13.595
some tango?

02:13.838 --> 02:14.927
No.

02:15.358 --> 02:16.116
No.

02:16.117 --> 02:17.669
I need $50.

02:17.910 --> 02:19.646
What, this boy is making you pay?

02:19.647 --> 02:22.930
No. It's free. I just need it.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.349
Paige, I'm sorry.
I don't feel so comfortable

02:25.350 --> 02:27.302
- giving you that much money
without... - Forget it, then.

02:27.829 --> 02:29.862
Hey, uh, what about our lunch?

02:31.010 --> 02:32.865
I don't eat grilled cheese anymore.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:43.831 --> 02:44.822
How's that look?

02:45.750 --> 02:49.905
"Olivia Carla Salazar,
born July 11, 2001,

02:50.166 --> 02:51.801
was placed for adoption"...

02:53.178 --> 02:55.488
- Go on. That's right.
- Wow. You're making a lot of progress

02:55.489 --> 02:56.855
with your reading, Olivia.

02:56.856 --> 02:57.935
They got me a tutor

02:57.936 --> 02:59.838
and they quiz me, like,
every five seconds.

03:00.271 --> 03:03.102
- She's exaggerating. It's more like
every ten seconds. - Yeah.

03:03.542 --> 03:05.922
"Placed in the home of"...
Hey, look.

03:06.530 --> 03:10.001
Scotty signed where it says
"full name of male applicant,"

03:10.002 --> 03:13.105
and Kevin signed where it says
"full name of female applicant."

03:13.106 --> 03:15.429
- Good catch.
- Yeah, our placement forms

03:15.430 --> 03:17.343
haven't quite caught up 
with the times.

03:17.453 --> 03:19.694
- Mm.
- "Kevin Herbert Walker"?

03:20.115 --> 03:21.553
That's your middle name?

03:21.594 --> 03:23.890
I'm gonna be calling you
Herb from now on.

03:23.891 --> 03:24.978
Are we done yet?

03:25.566 --> 03:28.382
Actually, I think you are.

03:29.146 --> 03:30.141
Yeah, all it takes now

03:30.142 --> 03:31.633
is a quick appearance 
before the judge,

03:31.634 --> 03:33.906
which is more of a celebration
than anything else,

03:33.907 --> 03:35.970
but it's official.

03:36.473 --> 03:37.673
No more weekends only?

03:37.674 --> 03:41.322
- Nope. You are a family now.
- Hee.

03:42.633 --> 03:43.993
So, Olivia, are you excited

03:43.994 --> 03:46.716
to start a new school on
Monday and meet new friends?

03:46.717 --> 03:48.254
Yeah, I guess it'll be fun.

03:48.973 --> 03:51.022
I just wish I could bring Zemulon.

03:51.029 --> 03:53.896
Oh, is this the famous gecko
I've been hearing about?

03:53.897 --> 03:57.001
- Oh, yeah.
- It's nice to finally meet you, sir.

03:57.078 --> 03:59.990
Well, if you need anything,
you know where to reach me.

03:59.993 --> 04:02.213
Other than that, I'd say,
my work here is done.

04:02.214 --> 04:04.134
- Bye, Jill.
- Bye, sweetie.

04:05.417 --> 04:06.340
Bye, Jill. Thank you.

04:06.341 --> 04:08.549
Mwah. Congratulations.

04:09.119 --> 04:09.968
- Thanks, Jill.
- Bye.

04:09.969 --> 04:11.293
Bye.

04:13.727 --> 04:15.399
What are you guys smiling about?

04:15.400 --> 04:17.053
Because we thought you

04:17.053 --> 04:19.512
might like to record our new
answering machine message.

04:19.514 --> 04:21.003
- Really?
- Yes, really.

04:21.934 --> 04:23.950
So just start talking...

04:25.008 --> 04:26.209
after the beep.

04:26.729 --> 04:27.857
Record your greeting

04:27.858 --> 04:29.154
after the tone.

04:30.290 --> 04:34.818
Hi, you've reached the home of
Kevin and Scotty and Olivia

04:35.314 --> 04:36.594
and Zemulon.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.657
- Of course.
- Please leave a message after the beep.

04:40.026 --> 04:41.193
Perfect.

04:44.407 --> 04:45.414
Perfect.

04:46.573 --> 04:47.209
Good work.

04:47.210 --> 04:49.121
Sarah, we didn't fly all the way
to Washington, D.C.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.625
just so you can check your e-mails.

04:50.626 --> 04:53.184
I'm not.
I'm going through her calendar.

04:53.185 --> 04:55.378
This just all feels creepy...

04:55.457 --> 04:58.878
Breaking in here,
snooping through all of Kitty's things.

04:58.879 --> 05:00.445
Mom, what are you talking about?

05:00.446 --> 05:03.357
This was your idea.
Besides, we didn't break in.

05:03.510 --> 05:05.147
There was a key under the mat.

05:05.148 --> 05:07.355
Well, maybe I'm just overreacting.

05:07.506 --> 05:08.881
Of course you're overreacting.

05:08.882 --> 05:10.523
I've been telling you that for...

05:10.524 --> 05:11.952
- But, no.
- Weeks.

05:11.953 --> 05:15.762
She came to D.C. for ten days
and has stayed for six weeks.

05:16.069 --> 05:18.009
I... I'm not overreacting.

05:18.010 --> 05:19.590
I-I-I just don't want her

05:19.591 --> 05:22.365
to be too upset with us 
for showing up.

05:22.366 --> 05:23.285
Don't worry, mom.

05:23.286 --> 05:25.221
Evan's birthday is a 
really good cover.

05:26.665 --> 05:28.027
Yeah. Anything yet there?

05:28.062 --> 05:29.582
Just playdates.

05:29.621 --> 05:32.653
Though there are quite
a lot of appointments

05:32.654 --> 05:34.526
with someone called Langley.

05:34.842 --> 05:37.089
Mm. Well, 
I looked in the kitchen.

05:37.090 --> 05:38.152
Nothing unusual there.

05:38.153 --> 05:41.365
A lot of vegetables...
celery, carrots, kale.

05:41.366 --> 05:43.382
- Kale?
- What?

05:43.450 --> 05:46.057
- Kitty hates kale.
- Is that a clue?

05:47.994 --> 05:50.314
I'm gonna go upstairs
and check the bedroom.

05:53.618 --> 05:54.802
Maybe she's decided

05:54.803 --> 05:57.140
to throw her hat
in the senate ring again

05:57.141 --> 05:59.189
or... or head up the R.N.C.

05:59.190 --> 06:01.137
They asked her to do that once.

06:01.402 --> 06:04.112
Or... or maybe she's just
sick to death of all of us

06:04.113 --> 06:06.405
and wants to start 
a whole new life.

06:06.422 --> 06:07.216
Who could blame her?

06:07.217 --> 06:10.320
I mean, it could be a million,
trillion things.

06:10.321 --> 06:12.541
- We just...
- Bingo!

06:12.542 --> 06:13.597
What?

06:15.398 --> 06:16.630
Mystery solved.

06:17.102 --> 06:17.628
Cologne?

06:17.629 --> 06:20.254
Men's cologne on the nightstand.

06:21.203 --> 06:23.273
Well, she's seeing someone.
I mean, think about it.

06:23.274 --> 06:26.228
Every time Kitty's gone A.W.O.L.
like this,

06:26.229 --> 06:27.937
she's been under 
the spell of a guy.

06:27.938 --> 06:30.921
If she were seeing someone,
why wouldn't she just tell us?

06:30.922 --> 06:33.194
Maybe he's married, or famous,

06:33.401 --> 06:35.519
or married and famous.
Think about it.

06:37.181 --> 06:38.797
- I just don't... it's Kitty...
It's Kitty. It's Kitty. - Act normal.

06:38.798 --> 06:41.327
- Wait. Wait. Sit down.
- Act normal.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.306
Surprise!

06:50.001 --> 06:51.821
Sync by YYeTS.net
www.addic7ed.com

06:56.774 --> 06:59.085
She's not drinking wine.
Did you notice that?

06:59.086 --> 07:01.669
- Yes. - This guy she's seeing
must be a real health nut.

07:01.670 --> 07:04.076
Oh, Sarah.
You don't know that it's a guy.

07:04.077 --> 07:06.045
The cologne could belong to anyone.

07:06.046 --> 07:08.445
Maybe it belongs to the people
she sublet this place from.

07:08.446 --> 07:12.357
Oh, wow.
He is so excited to see you guys.

07:12.358 --> 07:14.026
Well, I'm excited.

07:14.027 --> 07:16.353
Do you think I would miss
my grandson's birthday?

07:16.354 --> 07:19.241
- Aww.
- Are you enjoying being back in D.C.?

07:19.242 --> 07:21.697
As a matter of fact,
I didn't think that I would like it,

07:21.698 --> 07:22.626
but I do, I do.

07:23.184 --> 07:25.669
And since I don't have
anything going on in L.A.,

07:25.670 --> 07:27.878
I thought maybe
I would stay a little longer.

07:28.987 --> 07:30.248
How much longer?

07:30.351 --> 07:31.374
I don't know.

07:31.381 --> 07:34.439
I mean, it makes sense.
D.C.'s such a sexy town...

07:34.814 --> 07:38.382
All those men in
their high-powered suits.

07:39.034 --> 07:41.450
Oh, that's funny,
because I never noticed.

07:41.625 --> 07:44.729
Oh, yeah. I mean, a girl could
get into serious trouble here

07:44.730 --> 07:45.617
if she wasn't careful.

07:45.618 --> 07:48.084
Sarah, just stop, okay?
Leave her alone for a while.

07:48.085 --> 07:50.309
Me leave her alone?
Come on, mom.

07:50.310 --> 07:52.637
- You're practically stalking her.
- What are you guys talking about?

07:52.638 --> 07:55.069
Tell her why you dragged me
across the country.

07:55.070 --> 07:57.279
Oh, I knew it couldn't be 
just about Evan.

07:57.338 --> 08:01.513
L-look, Kitty, I'm sorry.
It just... we miss you.

08:01.913 --> 08:04.092
D-do you know that Olivia

08:04.093 --> 08:06.711
moved in with 
Kevin and Scotty today?

08:06.805 --> 08:08.644
Did you know that 
Paige was just invited

08:08.645 --> 08:12.058
- to her very first dance?
- She just got asked.

08:12.146 --> 08:13.066
This boy Cody.

08:13.067 --> 08:14.964
She's had the biggest
crush on him all year.

08:14.965 --> 08:16.037
It's sweet.

08:17.570 --> 08:20.850
I just feel like you're shutting
us out for some reason.

08:21.002 --> 08:22.875
We just... we want to know
what's going on here.

08:24.142 --> 08:25.405
Nothing.

08:25.527 --> 08:27.024
Nothing is going on.

08:27.025 --> 08:29.413
The only thing that is going on is,
I'm trying to get ready

08:29.414 --> 08:32.705
for my son's birthday party,
which is a very big deal,

08:32.706 --> 08:34.899
because he's turning 4.

08:36.210 --> 08:37.538
Do you guys need anything?

08:37.707 --> 08:39.208
No, no, thank you.

08:42.057 --> 08:44.092
Oh, God. Do you believe her?

08:44.094 --> 08:46.430
No. I still think
she's having an affair.

08:46.466 --> 08:47.873
Oh, whatever it is,

08:47.874 --> 08:50.185
she sure as hell doesn't want
to tell us about it.

08:50.186 --> 08:52.921
I wish we could find out more
about this guy Langley.

08:56.405 --> 08:57.573
Langley.

08:58.798 --> 09:01.657
Oh, my God.
Why didn't I see this before?

09:01.658 --> 09:04.452
- See what, mom?
- Sarah, where are we right now?

09:04.453 --> 09:05.610
Our nation's capital.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.784
Right, and all those men
in suits you were talking about,

09:08.785 --> 09:11.340
- who do they work for?
- The United States government.

09:11.341 --> 09:14.818
Right, and what branch of
the United States government

09:14.819 --> 09:18.546
demands total secrecy,
even from one's own family?

09:18.858 --> 09:20.138
Uh...

09:20.159 --> 09:21.951
National security, right.

09:22.103 --> 09:26.310
And where are
their headquarters located?

09:26.985 --> 09:28.186
Langley.

09:28.210 --> 09:28.757
Oh.

09:28.758 --> 09:30.229
Oh, my God, Sarah.

09:31.648 --> 09:33.614
Kitty's working for the CIA.

09:35.454 --> 09:36.725
Yeah, I know, Tiffany.

09:36.726 --> 09:39.254
But how can I get one
when he won't give me the money?

09:40.689 --> 09:41.809
Yeah.

09:42.070 --> 09:44.593
I do like him when
he's acting like my friend.

09:44.594 --> 09:46.545
And right now 
he's acting like my dad.

09:47.525 --> 09:48.517
Yeah.

09:49.383 --> 09:50.999
Nobody needs two dads.

09:52.082 --> 09:54.049
Whatever.
I'll... I'll figure something out.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.487
I know.

09:56.488 --> 09:58.553
Did you see 
Stefanie's hair today?

09:58.949 --> 10:01.333
I know. It looks like
she dyed it with ketchup.

10:02.162 --> 10:04.157
No way! You tell her.

10:04.158 --> 10:06.654
Paige, have you done
your homework yet?

10:07.206 --> 10:09.189
Yeah, it's almost finished.

10:09.190 --> 10:11.229
Then you need to hang up
and finish it.

10:11.230 --> 10:12.937
You can talk on the phone
after it's done.

10:13.222 --> 10:14.822
Tiffany, I have to go.

10:16.125 --> 10:17.950
Yeah. I'll call you back
in a little while.

10:27.348 --> 10:29.284
Hey, guys.
Did you have fun shopping?

10:29.285 --> 10:30.550
What is that?

10:30.586 --> 10:33.429
This is the sovereign
kingdom of Zemulonia.

10:33.430 --> 10:36.086
That's not what it's called.
It's called Gecko Town.

10:36.130 --> 10:39.037
Right, Gecko Town.
Population... one extremely lucky gecko.

10:39.038 --> 10:42.037
- Wow. How long did that take to build?
- All day.

10:42.038 --> 10:43.545
- How was work?
- Fine. I thought

10:43.546 --> 10:45.828
we were gonna go shopping
for school supplies.

10:45.829 --> 10:46.389
Well, we were,

10:46.390 --> 10:47.373
but we kind of got carried

10:47.374 --> 10:50.206
- away with Gecko Town.
- It's amazing, huh?

10:50.281 --> 10:51.793
Yeah, but don't you want 
to be prepared

10:51.794 --> 10:54.786
- for classes on Monday?
- Scotty said we could go later.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.477
Look, Zemulon,
it's a swimming pool.

10:57.810 --> 10:59.296
We... we can go together tomorrow.

10:59.746 --> 11:02.040
I have a great idea. Popsicles.

11:02.156 --> 11:04.088
Um, before dinner?

11:04.089 --> 11:06.394
No, we can use the wood
part for a diving board.

11:06.446 --> 11:08.286
Oh, how about an emery board?

11:08.287 --> 11:10.565
- I've got some in the bathroom
underneath the sink. - Emery board?

11:10.566 --> 11:13.302
- You use an emery board?
- Your middle name is Herbert?

11:13.626 --> 11:15.293
Oh, better yet.
There is a pink foot file.

11:15.294 --> 11:17.165
- You can use that.
- Perfect.

11:18.238 --> 11:19.929
Did you even leave the apartment?

11:19.930 --> 11:22.020
No, but I thought it was
important for her to,

11:22.021 --> 11:23.353
you know, 
make herself feel at home.

11:23.354 --> 11:25.641
- Well, she's definitely doing that.
- Kevin, relax.

11:25.642 --> 11:28.269
She is so happy right now.
That's the most important thing.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.240
Let her make a footprint, okay?

11:30.241 --> 11:31.886
A footprint's one thing,
but look at this place.

11:31.887 --> 11:33.726
- She's like sasquatch.
- Got it.

11:35.715 --> 11:38.061
So do I get a tour of Gecko Town?

11:38.357 --> 11:41.813
Sorry. Zemulon's not accepting
any visitors right now.

11:43.474 --> 11:44.466
Oh.

11:56.406 --> 11:57.534
Ah!

12:13.874 --> 12:14.914
Justin?

12:14.926 --> 12:15.729
Yeah.

12:15.730 --> 12:17.122
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

12:17.714 --> 12:19.490
- You sure?
- Yeah, I said I'm fine.

12:19.558 --> 12:20.934
All right, 'cause...

12:21.638 --> 12:23.292
It's like the third time
this has happened.

12:23.293 --> 12:24.824
What, am I keeping you up
or something?

12:24.825 --> 12:28.457
No. Never mind.

12:28.830 --> 12:30.814
Look, man, if there's a problem,
you can, uh, sleep over...

12:30.815 --> 12:33.165
It's not my problem I'm worried about.
It's yours.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.873
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I was there, too, remember?

12:37.786 --> 12:39.834
- Three tours, just like you.
- Oh, jeez.

12:41.005 --> 12:42.141
I know what you're going through.

12:42.142 --> 12:44.056
The only difference between
my problem and yours

12:44.057 --> 12:46.421
- is you've had a place to hide.
- Yeah, I don't have P.T.S.D., Zach.

12:46.422 --> 12:47.923
Yeah, that's what I kept 
telling myself

12:47.924 --> 12:49.439
my first couple weeks 
on the street.

12:50.301 --> 12:51.809
And now here I am 
two years later,

12:51.810 --> 12:53.618
and I'm still living out
of a duffel bag.

12:54.530 --> 12:55.573
Avoid it all you want, man,

12:55.574 --> 12:57.350
but eventually,
it's gonna catch up with you.

12:58.394 --> 13:01.592
Oh, that's a... that's a great speech.
Thanks. I'm good.

13:24.702 --> 13:26.440
Let me just finish feeding
the dog, and then,

13:26.441 --> 13:28.020
uh, we will get outta here.

13:28.399 --> 13:30.686
I'm in no rush.
Whose dog is it anyway?

13:31.064 --> 13:34.005
Uh, it's my mom's ex high-school boyfriend.

13:34.006 --> 13:36.662
She's taking care of her
until he comes back.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.158
Seems like you're taking care
of her to me.

13:40.159 --> 13:42.331
Well, someone has to. Ow!

13:43.082 --> 13:43.897
What happened?

13:43.898 --> 13:46.122
Nothing. I was putting up
shelves for my niece,

13:46.550 --> 13:48.333
and... oh, yeah,
I guess she's my niece now...

13:48.334 --> 13:52.062
Um, anyway, I banged it.
Where'd I put the can opener?

13:52.574 --> 13:53.154
You okay, man?

13:53.155 --> 13:55.685
- You seem a little out of it lately.
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

13:55.686 --> 13:57.533
I just haven't gotten a
lot of sleep lately.

13:57.534 --> 13:59.774
Is that homeless dude
still on your couch?

14:00.147 --> 14:02.476
Homeless vet, Dan. Homeless vet.

14:02.477 --> 14:04.638
Dude, get rid of him.
It's been like two weeks now.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.449
- Have a heart. Like, where is he gonna go?
- Is he handy?

14:07.450 --> 14:08.881
'Cause they're looking
for a building manager

14:08.882 --> 14:11.474
at my girlfriend's place...
Rent free,

14:11.802 --> 14:13.208
- sweet gig.
- You know, I don't know.

14:13.209 --> 14:15.362
I just got him a job with
my... my brother-in-law,

14:15.363 --> 14:18.229
and he's in a regimen now.
I don't want to mess him up.

14:19.022 --> 14:20.269
All right. Go, little girl.

14:20.889 --> 14:22.330
I'll be back to walk you later.

14:22.938 --> 14:25.690
All right, your call.
I'm just trying to help you out.

14:26.661 --> 14:28.892
It seems like you've got a lot
on your plate these days.

14:28.893 --> 14:31.097
Yeah, well, from each
according to his abilities

14:31.098 --> 14:32.890
to each according to his needs.

14:33.954 --> 14:35.018
Who said that?

14:35.471 --> 14:38.308
Um, I don't know. Some communist guy

14:38.309 --> 14:40.326
and my mother, a lot.

14:41.954 --> 14:44.211
And then how cool is this?

14:44.569 --> 14:48.054
An 8-piece multipurpose
compass and geometry set.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.825
Even cooler... unicorn stickers.

14:50.826 --> 14:52.058
You want a few for Paige?

14:52.408 --> 14:54.501
If only stickers 
could solve my problem.

14:54.801 --> 14:56.929
Paige wouldn't even talk
to me this morning.

14:57.318 --> 14:58.881
At least she spent
the night in her own bed.

14:58.882 --> 15:01.202
- Olivia spent the night in her fort.
- A fort?

15:01.259 --> 15:04.273
Yeah. We spent all
this money fixing up her room,

15:04.274 --> 15:07.280
and she's just not interested in it.

15:07.999 --> 15:10.014
It's all about Gecko Town now.

15:11.114 --> 15:11.980
You want a coffee?

15:11.981 --> 15:13.134
Please.

15:13.586 --> 15:15.217
So what are you 
gonna do about Paige?

15:15.638 --> 15:17.741
I don't know.
I think I'm gonna call Sarah.

15:17.742 --> 15:20.270
N-no, absolutely not.
That's like admitting defeat.

15:20.426 --> 15:22.700
Look, if the women of
this family leave town

15:22.701 --> 15:24.541
and we fall apart, game over.

15:28.661 --> 15:29.813
Ah, speak of the devil.

15:29.814 --> 15:30.917
Bad news?

15:31.767 --> 15:32.925
"Just give her the money.

15:32.926 --> 15:34.417
I will explain when I get home."

15:34.922 --> 15:35.540
I can't believe this.

15:35.541 --> 15:37.402
She's just completely
undermined my authority.

15:37.403 --> 15:40.069
Well, don't lose your resolve.
Look, Sarah is out of town.

15:40.070 --> 15:41.670
You're in charge now.

15:44.418 --> 15:46.116
It's... it's... it's
a mother's worst nightmare.

15:46.117 --> 15:47.521
I'm... I'm losing my daughter

15:47.522 --> 15:50.329
to a covert branch
of the U.S. government.

15:50.330 --> 15:52.442
I can't even process this.

15:53.081 --> 15:56.146
Well, I'm sure there are
other CIA operatives

15:56.147 --> 15:58.233
with clingy,
codependent families like ours.

15:58.234 --> 16:00.682
So maybe you can find a
support group somewhere.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.378
I gotta take this.

16:03.386 --> 16:04.970
Hey, babe. Is everything okay?

16:05.010 --> 16:05.691
No, no, no.

16:05.692 --> 16:08.104
It makes it very hard
for me to be the parent

16:08.105 --> 16:09.973
if Paige knows
she can just go around me..

16:09.974 --> 16:11.364
- Tell her she's undermining your
authority. - Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

16:11.365 --> 16:13.609
Yeah, you're undermining
my authority, Sarah.

16:13.610 --> 16:15.062
Look, things have been crazy here.

16:15.063 --> 16:16.312
It's Evan's birthday 
this afternoon,

16:16.313 --> 16:18.649
and mom thinks 
Kitty's joined the CIA.

16:18.710 --> 16:20.269
Your mom thinks 
Kitty is in the CIA.

16:20.270 --> 16:21.265
Well, that's ridiculous.

16:21.266 --> 16:22.425
I can get a secret out of Kitty

16:22.426 --> 16:24.784
- with a glass of chardonnay.
- Just tell me what it's for.

16:24.785 --> 16:26.012
I can't.

16:26.013 --> 16:28.400
I... I'm not trying to undermine you.
I promise you, I'm not.

16:28.401 --> 16:31.679
I... okay, listen. It's for a bra.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.577
- A bra?
- She's too embarrassed to tell you.

16:34.578 --> 16:37.206
So could you just please
give her the money

16:37.207 --> 16:39.140
and don't say that I said anything?

16:39.466 --> 16:42.554
- Okay. I-I'll call you later.
- Love you.

16:42.697 --> 16:43.929
It was for a bra?

16:44.258 --> 16:46.770
You see, you were just making
mountains out of molehills.

16:47.726 --> 16:50.852
- That... that came out wrong.
- She was too embarrassed to tell me.

16:50.853 --> 16:51.593
Well, of course.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.754
I'm sure she wouldn't even
say that to her real dad.

16:54.998 --> 16:56.549
That came out wrong as well.

16:56.910 --> 16:59.261
My daughter is buying her
first strapless bra,

16:59.262 --> 17:00.728
and I really should be there.

17:00.729 --> 17:02.633
I mean,
I'm enjoying watching them navigate

17:02.634 --> 17:04.045
the whole father-daughter thing.

17:04.046 --> 17:05.393
- It's very sweet, but I really...
- Yeah,

17:05.394 --> 17:06.941
it's all sweet until she turns up

17:06.942 --> 17:09.285
with a fake passport
and a Russian accent.

17:09.286 --> 17:11.189
Okay, well,
I guess that should do it.

17:11.190 --> 17:13.069
Oh, shoot. Shoot.

17:13.069 --> 17:15.053
I forgot the cupcakes.
I'll be right back.

17:16.390 --> 17:16.965
And that's the thing...

17:16.967 --> 17:19.873
We'll never know if
she's telling us the truth anymore.

17:20.737 --> 17:21.648
What?

17:25.126 --> 17:26.069
Who is that?

17:26.069 --> 17:28.484
I don't know,
but he's very handsome.

17:29.965 --> 17:30.838
Ring.

17:30.839 --> 17:32.788
See? She's not involved 
with the CIA.

17:32.789 --> 17:35.488
She's just ruining a marriage.

17:35.489 --> 17:36.401
Very funny.

17:36.402 --> 17:39.125
Well, whatever it is, mom,
it's Kitty's business.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.310
She's a grown-up.

17:40.562 --> 17:42.201
Now my daughter is going
to her first dance.

17:42.202 --> 17:45.022
- I'm missing the whole thing.
I want to go home. - Look. Look.

17:45.651 --> 17:47.089
- What?
- Oh, my goodness.

17:47.225 --> 17:50.473
He took her basket.
She took his.

17:50.641 --> 17:52.161
It's a bag switch.

17:52.162 --> 17:54.466
You're having 
James Bond fantasies.

18:03.306 --> 18:04.127
Okay, that was weird.

18:04.128 --> 18:05.297
That was weird.

18:05.993 --> 18:07.209
Do you believe me now?

18:07.560 --> 18:10.504
Oh, come on, mom.
Kitty joining the CIA?

18:10.505 --> 18:11.737
The whole idea is preposterous.

18:11.738 --> 18:14.960
Sarah, Sarah, listen to me.
I never told you this,

18:14.961 --> 18:18.201
but the CIA wanted Robert
to become an agent.

18:18.202 --> 18:19.717
- Kitty told me that.
- She did?

18:19.718 --> 18:22.853
It makes perfect sense that
they would go after Kitty.

18:23.147 --> 18:26.490
Think of it...
First Robert, now Kitty.

18:26.586 --> 18:28.469
- You're scaring me, mom.
- I know.

18:28.470 --> 18:30.198
Hey, so they don't, um...

18:31.090 --> 18:32.833
have the cupcakes that Evan likes,

18:32.834 --> 18:35.329
but there's a place
on the way to day care.

18:35.354 --> 18:39.386
Um, I'm gonna get
a cup of tea first, okay?

18:42.905 --> 18:43.604
Tea, my ass.

18:43.605 --> 18:45.289
She's probably off
to assassinate Castro.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.577
Okay, listen,
you are officially cut off.

18:47.610 --> 18:49.385
I'm gonna go and
get to the bottom of this

18:49.386 --> 18:50.650
once and for all.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.598
Sarah. Sarah, wait.

18:54.539 --> 18:55.594
Sarah.

19:10.669 --> 19:13.148
Okay, you, listen, start talking,

19:13.149 --> 19:15.073
because the sooner we get
to the bottom of this,

19:15.074 --> 19:16.488
the sooner we can all go home.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.993
Kitty, I know what's going on.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.953
- You do? - Well, the kale
threw me off for a minute,

19:21.954 --> 19:23.522
but I finally figured it out.

19:26.859 --> 19:27.569
No, no, no, listen.

19:27.570 --> 19:29.121
Okay, wait, you. Sit.

19:29.267 --> 19:32.273
Listen, would you just
tell her what is going on?

19:32.274 --> 19:33.285
She is freaking out.

19:33.286 --> 19:35.117
Look, you would be freaking out, too,

19:35.118 --> 19:36.927
if your daughter's life
was in jeopardy.

19:36.928 --> 19:38.517
My life is not in jeopardy,

19:38.518 --> 19:40.233
and I'm sorry
I didn't tell you sooner.

19:40.234 --> 19:42.541
I should've known that
you would figure it out sooner or later.

19:42.542 --> 19:43.673
Well, when were you
planning on telling us?

19:43.674 --> 19:47.053
- I didn't want to alarm you.
- I'm alarmed, Kitty. I'm alarmed.

19:47.054 --> 19:48.525
It's not as bad as it sounds.

19:48.526 --> 19:49.685
How could it be
not as bad as it sounds?

19:49.686 --> 19:51.533
- It's not. Wait. Wait.
- Are you serious?

19:51.534 --> 19:54.045
Are you saying mom's right?
You're in the CIA?

19:54.617 --> 19:57.217
The... the... the CIA?

19:57.218 --> 19:59.378
Kitty, you don't have
to hide it anymore.

20:00.326 --> 20:02.129
Why would I be in the CIA?

20:02.130 --> 20:03.701
They'd be lucky to have you.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.799
Well, I'm not in the CIA.

20:06.886 --> 20:08.485
Kitty, look,

20:08.794 --> 20:12.304
we saw that little hand
signal/ bag switch thing.

20:12.305 --> 20:13.709
That was weird. We saw that.

20:13.710 --> 20:15.640
- Bag switch?
- Yeah, we saw it.

20:15.641 --> 20:16.842
- Kitty.
- Wh...

20:17.366 --> 20:18.385
Sorry to interrupt.

20:18.386 --> 20:21.534
I think I have your basket,
and you've got mine.

20:22.736 --> 20:24.594
Bag switch.

20:25.435 --> 20:27.296
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

20:27.297 --> 20:28.797
- Yeah, that's... yeah, that's mine.
- That... no, my fault.

20:28.798 --> 20:30.791
- I'm sorry, no.
- Uh, this is, um...

20:30.792 --> 20:33.202
- Dale. - This is my sister
and this is my mother.

20:33.203 --> 20:34.809
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

20:34.810 --> 20:36.222
- Hello, Dale.
- Dale and I are taking

20:36.240 --> 20:40.025
a sign language class with
Evan and Dale's son Sam.

20:41.122 --> 20:43.097
Isn't that right, Dale?

20:43.098 --> 20:45.275
Attagirl. That's right.

20:45.705 --> 20:46.713
- Getting there.
- Yeah.

20:46.714 --> 20:49.578
And your wife,
d-does she sign, too?

20:49.585 --> 20:50.993
Actually, she's much better 
than I am.

20:50.994 --> 20:53.194
I'm trying to catch up in class.

20:53.327 --> 20:55.250
Yeah, well, you can meet
her at the party, Sarah,

20:55.251 --> 20:56.700
because you're gonna
bring her to the party,

20:56.701 --> 20:57.994
- right?
- Oh, yeah. We'll all be there.

20:57.995 --> 20:59.522
I'm so sorry about the mix-up.

20:59.523 --> 21:02.028
- Uh, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

21:02.029 --> 21:03.053
See you later.

21:04.858 --> 21:06.389
- Bye.
- So...

21:07.406 --> 21:09.332
How embarrassed are you

21:09.333 --> 21:12.785
on a scale from 1 to 10,
10 being the worst?

21:12.786 --> 21:14.081
Well, Kitty, what do you expect?

21:14.082 --> 21:17.126
I mean, you... you... you
vanish for weeks on end...

21:17.127 --> 21:18.832
You go completely incommunicado.

21:18.833 --> 21:20.159
You don't return our phone calls.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.561
- Your voice mail gets full.
- We don't hear from you at a...

21:21.562 --> 21:25.313
- It's my bone marrow.
- What?

21:25.314 --> 21:26.736
What's wrong with your bone marrow?

21:26.737 --> 21:29.361
It's a complication 
from the transplant.

21:29.362 --> 21:32.769
- Apparently, it's very common.
- Oh, my God, Kitty.

21:32.770 --> 21:34.437
Oh, it's not "oh, my God," mom.

21:34.438 --> 21:36.809
It's fine.
I'm... I'm seeing a specialist.

21:37.092 --> 21:38.941
Uh, his name is Brian Langley

21:38.942 --> 21:40.494
if you want to Google him.

21:40.747 --> 21:44.208
- Brian Langley.
- Dr. Brian Langley.

21:44.209 --> 21:46.084
Yes, Dr. Brian Langley.

21:46.085 --> 21:47.893
He's very good at 
this sort of thing.

21:47.946 --> 21:50.201
I've been through a round
of steroid treatments,

21:50.202 --> 21:52.529
and he put me on a very
healthy organic diet,

21:52.530 --> 21:55.234
and everything seems
to be back on track.

21:55.938 --> 21:57.474
And now?

21:58.638 --> 21:59.806
Cupcakes.

22:00.297 --> 22:01.934
Now I need to go buy cupcakes.

22:01.935 --> 22:05.053
Look, you can't lay this on
us and then go buy cupcakes.

22:05.101 --> 22:07.117
Really? Well, you can't
fly across the country

22:07.149 --> 22:08.893
and expect me
to talk about something

22:08.911 --> 22:10.686
that I'm not ready to talk about.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.276
I'm gonna go buy cupcakes.

22:20.652 --> 22:22.525
Let's buy cupcakes.

22:22.572 --> 22:25.018
- It's bigger.
- A little.

22:25.036 --> 22:26.467
A little? Come on, Scotty.

22:26.498 --> 22:28.161
It's an architectural monstrosity.

22:28.882 --> 22:31.378
I'm surprised she hasn't had
plumbing and electric installed.

22:32.562 --> 22:33.968
Is she... 
is she downstairs with the tutor?

22:33.986 --> 22:34.615
Yes.

22:35.352 --> 22:37.799
Maybe she'll become a
contractor when she grows up.

22:37.847 --> 22:39.132
Really? That's your response?

22:39.164 --> 22:40.348
You're just gonna roll with it?

22:40.365 --> 22:43.546
Okay,
it has gotten a little out of hand,

22:43.580 --> 22:45.643
but we want her
to feel at home, right?

22:45.662 --> 22:48.081
Yes, feel at home,
not build one.

22:48.101 --> 22:50.179
This thing is dangerous.
If Zemulon's heat lamps

22:50.199 --> 22:52.372
scorch one of those sheets,
we'd have a fire on our hands.

22:52.404 --> 22:55.780
- Okay. We'll be careful.
- I think it's out of control.

22:55.799 --> 22:57.522
I mean, I know we want
to be the cool parents,

22:57.570 --> 23:00.818
and she's having a good time,
but something's going on.

23:00.823 --> 23:03.073
- I think she's overcompensating.
- What do you mean?

23:03.091 --> 23:05.410
She has a new home,
a new family.

23:05.428 --> 23:06.805
She's starting a
new school on Monday,

23:06.837 --> 23:08.612
which you've conveniently
let her ignore.

23:08.629 --> 23:11.128
Now she has a slew of Walkers
about to descend on her.

23:11.146 --> 23:13.576
I think she's scared 
out of her mind.

23:13.606 --> 23:14.744
Okay.

23:15.576 --> 23:18.920
What do you think we
should do, tear it down?

23:18.946 --> 23:21.257
No. I think we should talk to her.

23:22.424 --> 23:24.369
Whatever it is,
she needs to tell us,

23:24.375 --> 23:26.863
but this fort isn't the answer.

23:28.783 --> 23:30.447
Okay, when she's done
with her tutor,

23:30.453 --> 23:32.864
we will talk to her. Agreed?

23:32.884 --> 23:33.529
Agreed.

23:39.494 --> 23:40.932
You got it?

23:41.507 --> 23:44.300
Easy, boys.
You're a day late and a dollar short.

23:44.317 --> 23:46.099
- The guy's dead.
- How do you know?

23:46.132 --> 23:48.721
Trust me. He's dead.
I already called the coroner.

23:48.752 --> 23:49.872
What are you, a doctor?

23:49.889 --> 23:51.583
No, but the lady 
at the next table is.

23:51.605 --> 23:53.947
- Oh, so you must have seen
her degree, then? - Justin.

23:53.965 --> 23:56.651
We're fine, officer.
Just a little on edge today.

23:58.538 --> 23:59.653
Jerk.

23:59.677 --> 24:01.172
Get it under control, dude.

24:01.190 --> 24:03.554
You're freaking people out.
You're kind of freaking me out.

24:03.586 --> 24:06.242
All right? You okay?

24:07.234 --> 24:08.816
Sorry, folks. Bad day.

24:10.736 --> 24:12.000
Paige.

24:12.769 --> 24:14.816
Paige, what time do you need
to be at that dance tonight?

24:21.215 --> 24:22.136
Mon dieu.

24:22.852 --> 24:23.906
You look beautiful.

24:23.922 --> 24:28.369
Yeah. Better take a picture then,
'cause 'cause I'm not going.

24:28.387 --> 24:29.553
What are you doing?

24:34.311 --> 24:35.896
Cody called.

24:37.879 --> 24:39.975
He's taking Stefanie instead.

24:39.993 --> 24:41.064
What?

24:41.096 --> 24:44.054
He asked Stefanie first, and...

24:44.949 --> 24:48.006
She said no,
but now she changed her mind.

24:48.022 --> 24:49.477
Paige, I'm so sorry.

24:49.495 --> 24:53.381
I didn't even want to...
to go the stupid dance anyway,

24:53.399 --> 24:56.125
but he probably just
asked me as a joke.

24:56.157 --> 24:57.054
No, Paige.

24:57.710 --> 25:00.270
Paige, wait. Paige.

25:03.789 --> 25:04.926
Oh, I-I can't believe it.

25:04.959 --> 25:07.775
They're completely booked.
They're completely booked.

25:07.793 --> 25:08.381
- Booked out?
- There isn't gonna... No, yeah.

25:08.382 --> 25:09.835
There's not gonna be 
a birthday party.

25:09.853 --> 25:11.435
I can't believe it.
We come here all the time.

25:11.452 --> 25:13.259
I didn't even think
to make a reservation.

25:13.270 --> 25:14.812
Well, honey,
we'll figure something out.

25:14.843 --> 25:15.969
How are we gonna
figure something out, mom?

25:15.974 --> 25:18.001
I have 15 people coming
in about 20 minutes.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.672
- What are we gonna...
- Kitty, calm down, okay?

25:19.705 --> 25:21.304
There'll be another place nearby...

25:21.336 --> 25:22.958
You know what?
There isn't another place.

25:22.976 --> 25:24.414
- That we can make a shift of venue.
- There isn't another place.

25:24.432 --> 25:26.478
And besides,
this is what I promised Evan.

25:26.484 --> 25:28.444
This is Evan's favorite place.
I cannot believe I did this.

25:28.476 --> 25:29.740
- How stupid am I?
- It's not

25:29.747 --> 25:31.198
like you didn't have a
whole lot going on, honey.

25:31.217 --> 25:33.116
You know what, mom?
Please don't try to make this all rosy.

25:33.144 --> 25:35.917
- This is not a rosy situation.
- I won't make it a rosy situation.

25:35.923 --> 25:37.821
God, I'm sorry.
I've gotta make a call.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.061
Oh, my God. What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

25:40.075 --> 25:41.267
Do you have a guest list?
I could

25:41.287 --> 25:44.748
- start making calls...
- There is no guest list, mom.

25:44.767 --> 25:46.156
I don't even know
who's coming to this thing.

25:46.174 --> 25:47.302
I don't know...
Courtney, the kids,

25:47.308 --> 25:49.963
uh, uh, some people from my stupid
sign language class. I don't know.

25:50.012 --> 25:51.772
Honey, I want to help you.
I want to help you.

25:51.779 --> 25:53.067
I'm your mother.
I want to help you.

25:53.087 --> 25:55.207
I-I'll make some calls.
We'll find another place.

25:55.213 --> 25:57.868
A museum perhaps
or a big playground?

25:57.900 --> 25:59.915
There must be another place...
a park?

25:59.942 --> 26:00.960
- You know...
- You know what you could do?

26:00.977 --> 26:02.719
You know what you could do
if you really want to help?

26:02.751 --> 26:05.631
You could stand here,
and when everyone comes in,

26:05.649 --> 26:07.726
you can just tell them
that she screwed up

26:07.746 --> 26:09.535
and there isn't gonna be a party.

26:09.556 --> 26:12.240
Good, all right.
And... and where are you going?

26:12.261 --> 26:13.257
I don't know. I don't know.

26:13.279 --> 26:16.507
I-I'm not gonna let Evan's
birthday fall apart, okay?

26:17.116 --> 26:18.249
Okay.

26:21.002 --> 26:23.049
Wh-wh-where are they going?

26:23.068 --> 26:24.361
I have no idea.

26:24.379 --> 26:25.609
We're to wait here

26:25.615 --> 26:27.570
and tell everybody
the party's canceled.

26:27.588 --> 26:30.738
Oh, God.
This day is contagious.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.610
The bad news
just keeps on spreading.

26:32.627 --> 26:34.658
Paige got stood up.

26:34.664 --> 26:35.585
Oh, no.

26:35.591 --> 26:38.273
She's apparently inconsolable,

26:38.291 --> 26:40.401
sobbing in her room
with the door locked.

26:40.408 --> 26:42.913
- Poor thing.
- Oh, no. Sarah. I'm so sorry.

26:42.919 --> 26:44.086
- I know. I feel bad.
- I should

26:44.092 --> 26:46.441
never have forced you to
fly out here with me.

26:46.447 --> 26:49.326
It's... this is my fault.
I've made everything so much worse.

26:49.357 --> 26:51.597
Mom, you thought your daughter
was in trouble. She was.

26:51.598 --> 26:53.064
I get it.

26:53.071 --> 26:55.392
Sarah, I love you.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.789
- Let's go. - Yeah, let's find
these people and tell 'em to go home.

27:10.723 --> 27:11.857
Hey, man.

27:12.705 --> 27:13.649
Dan called.

27:14.544 --> 27:17.088
Um, yeah.
He, uh, he called my cell, too.

27:17.121 --> 27:18.847
You okay?

27:19.839 --> 27:22.400
No, not really.
We lost a guy today.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.480
Yeah, Dan said.
Do you want to talk about it?

27:25.344 --> 27:27.568
Yeah, uh, actually, I do.

27:28.799 --> 27:30.927
I think you're right, Zach.

27:33.297 --> 27:35.952
I think I do have a problem,
but it's not what you think.

27:36.784 --> 27:39.967
You see that...
that, uh, dream I had...

27:40.959 --> 27:43.824
Or nightmare,
I guess I should call it.

27:44.655 --> 27:46.750
I've been having
ever since I was a kid.

27:46.756 --> 27:48.590
It's not P.T.S.D.

27:48.609 --> 27:49.728
Okay.

27:52.700 --> 27:53.690
You see, it's, um...

27:54.490 --> 27:57.529
It's like an
end-of-the-world dream.

27:57.551 --> 28:00.487
There's an earthquake,
and, uh, you know,

28:00.504 --> 28:02.390
people are running around
screaming and hurt,

28:02.408 --> 28:03.137
and...

28:04.450 --> 28:06.737
I can't find my family.

28:07.633 --> 28:11.201
And I'm just, uh, in the middle
of trying to save everyone.

28:12.017 --> 28:14.370
I mean, I'm...
I'm trying to save...

28:16.001 --> 28:16.889
Everyone.

28:16.907 --> 28:17.897
And do you?

28:18.968 --> 28:22.137
No. And that's why
I wake up screaming.

28:23.705 --> 28:25.128
I guess that's what you heard.

28:25.175 --> 28:27.033
And I haven't had
that dream in a long time.

28:27.833 --> 28:31.316
- You mean until I showed up.
- Yeah.

28:31.347 --> 28:32.771
So...

28:33.287 --> 28:34.956
You've been trying to save me.

28:35.676 --> 28:38.604
I'm the straw that broke
the paramedic's back.

28:38.610 --> 28:40.286
Listen, Zach, I think...

28:40.302 --> 28:43.182
Justin... it's cool.

28:43.878 --> 28:45.899
Dan told me about
this building manager gig.

28:45.917 --> 28:47.499
I've gotta go meet the owner,

28:47.532 --> 28:49.675
but he said the job
is mine if I want it.

28:49.681 --> 28:50.907
So...

28:52.236 --> 28:54.220
Consider me saved, okay?

28:58.827 --> 29:00.316
There's one down.

29:03.364 --> 29:04.799
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

29:05.406 --> 29:06.365
Ah, I don't know.

29:06.381 --> 29:07.644
You know,
I'll figure something out.

29:09.980 --> 29:12.716
So, uh, how about this game?

29:13.724 --> 29:14.272
The game?

29:14.290 --> 29:17.215
Trust me, not even you can save
the Clippers at this point.

29:17.235 --> 29:19.952
- Ooh, that bad, huh?
- Yeah, it's pretty bad.

29:20.798 --> 29:22.987
Who pushes it,
blowing past Robinson

29:22.996 --> 29:25.148
and takes it all the way
for the easy layup.

29:31.443 --> 29:33.139
Um, I was just making us an omelet.

29:33.157 --> 29:34.667
I thought you might be hungry.

29:35.434 --> 29:36.843
It smells good.

29:38.074 --> 29:40.634
Paige, uh,
do you want to call your dad?

29:40.640 --> 29:42.202
It might be good, talking to him.

29:42.207 --> 29:44.698
No. He'll just...

29:44.704 --> 29:47.465
He'll just tell me that
everything's gonna be okay.

29:48.538 --> 29:51.067
Yeah. It's hard to hear that
when you know it's not true.

29:52.734 --> 29:53.660
What do you mean?

29:53.679 --> 29:56.394
Well, it's never easy to
get your heart broken.

29:56.412 --> 29:58.810
A little piece of it
always stays broken.

29:58.829 --> 30:00.986
So what do you do?

30:03.194 --> 30:06.538
You just bear it
as best as you can.

30:07.659 --> 30:09.337
And one day you realize,

30:09.343 --> 30:10.987
only a little piece of it is broken.

30:10.999 --> 30:13.115
You still have more.

30:15.034 --> 30:16.681
Look, Paige,

30:16.699 --> 30:18.233
you want to know a secret?

30:18.251 --> 30:21.835
I think you have more heart
than anyone I ever met.

30:25.433 --> 30:26.601
The boutonniere.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.754
Guess I won't be
needing this anymore.

30:37.882 --> 30:40.713
Go on. Get us some plates.

30:41.881 --> 30:44.345
And then after dinner,
I have an idea

30:44.363 --> 30:46.329
that might make you
feel much better.

30:47.209 --> 30:49.001
Hmm? And what's that?

30:49.006 --> 30:51.352
Well, we still have...

30:52.729 --> 30:54.552
14 eggs left.

30:58.536 --> 31:00.841
Do you know
this boy Cody's address?

31:01.929 --> 31:03.641
Wait. What?

31:03.659 --> 31:04.905
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

31:07.639 --> 31:09.048
Knock. Knock.

31:09.847 --> 31:10.984
What are you doing?

31:11.006 --> 31:13.576
Wow. This is so much bigger
than my first apartment.

31:14.424 --> 31:16.169
Oh, wow. Yeah.

31:16.186 --> 31:17.129
Yeah.

31:17.160 --> 31:18.424
And if we move the TV over there,

31:18.441 --> 31:20.649
- we'll have so much more
room for the microwave. - Mm.

31:20.655 --> 31:22.257
- Microwave?
- Yeah.

31:22.289 --> 31:26.209
Look, Olivia, the whole
point of us adopting you

31:26.227 --> 31:28.262
was that we could all live together.

31:28.283 --> 31:29.975
Now if you want to live in here,
that's cool.

31:29.981 --> 31:33.256
- But Scotty and I are gonna join you.
- There's not enough room.

31:33.274 --> 31:34.646
- Oh, there's enough room.
- Yeah.

31:34.678 --> 31:37.763
- You guys really want to
live in here with me? - Yeah.

31:37.781 --> 31:40.723
- If that's what you want.
- Would I still have to go to school?

31:40.744 --> 31:43.253
Yes, but we would be here
when you got back.

31:43.264 --> 31:44.147
Are you...

31:44.153 --> 31:47.509
- Are you nervous about going to school?
- A little.

31:47.529 --> 31:49.739
Mm-hmm. I hated school.

31:50.156 --> 31:52.907
I used to put a thermometer
up against the lightbulb

31:52.931 --> 31:54.636
so I could fake a fever
and stay home all day.

31:54.698 --> 31:56.028
Don't tell her how to do that.

31:56.047 --> 31:57.756
The point is,
it's okay to be scared.

31:57.761 --> 32:00.347
You can tell us that,
because that's why we're here,

32:00.363 --> 32:02.042
to make you feel safe.

32:04.482 --> 32:05.802
I'm kind of nervous about meeting

32:05.835 --> 32:07.435
your brothers and sisters, too.

32:07.454 --> 32:09.885
I can totally relate.
I was terrified.

32:09.902 --> 32:11.539
But now I'm one of the family.

32:11.557 --> 32:14.195
And guess what.
You're one of the family, too.

32:17.011 --> 32:20.403
So do you guys want me
to read you a story

32:20.422 --> 32:22.670
- before we go to sleep?
- Yes.

32:24.301 --> 32:25.470
What are we having?

32:25.501 --> 32:27.006
"Good night, grasshopper."

32:28.255 --> 32:29.295
A classic.

32:30.543 --> 32:34.671
"Once upon a time,
in a big field near the city,

32:34.676 --> 32:35.903
"a grasshopper family

32:35.921 --> 32:38.623
"lived in their grasshopper house

32:38.657 --> 32:40.896
doing grasshopper things all the day long."

32:42.383 --> 32:44.207
Oh. He's asleep.

32:45.023 --> 32:48.592
So... you both had a good time.

32:48.624 --> 32:49.704
Yeah, we did.

32:49.721 --> 32:52.632
We, um, we went to a movie,

32:52.650 --> 32:54.745
and then we ate spaghetti,

32:54.750 --> 32:56.552
and then we played laser tag.

32:56.571 --> 32:59.865
Okay, here we are.
I made a nice pot of tea.

32:59.882 --> 33:02.857
Oh, I miss coffee
and I hate kale.

33:02.868 --> 33:04.329
Told you so.

33:04.361 --> 33:06.904
No, you know, it really sucks
being on a healthy diet.

33:06.910 --> 33:09.658
I promise you, I'm dreaming
about cheeseburgers and bacon.

33:09.677 --> 33:11.994
- Well, so am I.
- Who isn't?

33:17.135 --> 33:18.497
What is this doing here?

33:18.577 --> 33:20.673
Uh, uh, that would be me.

33:20.705 --> 33:22.610
I-I-I thought...

33:22.642 --> 33:25.854
- You know what? It's a long story.
- It's Robert's.

33:27.341 --> 33:29.791
Okay, now I feel
like a real idiot.

33:29.810 --> 33:31.630
Well, that's because
you are a real idiot.

33:31.648 --> 33:33.438
Well, I guess I deserve that.

33:33.444 --> 33:35.134
And I know it's crazy,

33:35.153 --> 33:37.982
but it's... it's...
it's comforting somehow.

33:39.198 --> 33:42.355
Courtney had a box of stuff
from our old apartment in D.C.,

33:42.403 --> 33:44.690
and this is all I... I took.

33:45.385 --> 33:47.773
It's beautif...
It's completely understandable.

33:47.791 --> 33:50.029
Especially given,
you've just had a really big scare.

33:50.035 --> 33:53.052
Yeah, I think that I am,
uh, traumatized.

33:53.086 --> 33:55.949
Like the time at the beach
that one summer

33:55.955 --> 33:58.032
when I got caught in
that really big riptide,

33:58.050 --> 34:00.471
and I didn't go back into
the ocean for 16 years.

34:00.503 --> 34:03.126
Oh, Kitty, there will
always be riptides in life.

34:03.148 --> 34:05.670
But you can't let that keep you
from going back in the water.

34:05.687 --> 34:07.303
And you can't hide out here,

34:07.321 --> 34:09.478
- waiting for something bad to
happen to you. - I'm sorry.

34:09.496 --> 34:11.733
- What are you talking about?
I'm not hiding out. - Yes, you are.

34:11.752 --> 34:12.723
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

34:12.755 --> 34:14.402
Yes, you are.
You're hiding out.

34:14.408 --> 34:18.545
And, Kitty, what if something did happen?
What about Evan?

34:18.565 --> 34:21.793
Before when you were ill,
you knew you had Robert.

34:21.813 --> 34:23.681
And he would be there for him.

34:23.699 --> 34:26.251
But God forbid something
should happen again,

34:26.268 --> 34:27.578
it will be me.

34:27.626 --> 34:29.605
I will be there for him.

34:29.637 --> 34:31.188
Kitty, you're not alone.

34:31.221 --> 34:33.047
Okay. Okay.

34:33.065 --> 34:34.983
But I just want us to all be aware

34:35.003 --> 34:38.344
that we are having the conversation

34:38.360 --> 34:39.992
that I never really wanted to have.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.655
The one about me dying.

34:42.728 --> 34:45.340
So? I mean, so what?

34:45.359 --> 34:48.541
None of us are supposed
to write a will? I...

34:48.545 --> 34:51.708
We prepare for the worst.
We hope for the best.

34:52.286 --> 34:55.183
Well... no, I've never been
in your shoes, Kitty,

34:55.208 --> 34:57.871
but you've gotta know that
if the worst were to happen...

34:59.344 --> 35:01.616
That your boy would be loved

35:02.865 --> 35:04.127
and that he would have a home.

35:06.368 --> 35:08.125
You've gotta know that.

35:08.684 --> 35:10.750
Yeah, I know.

35:11.340 --> 35:13.195
Good. I do.
I know. I know. I know.

35:13.215 --> 35:15.195
And this is ridiculous.
This is ridiculous.

35:15.216 --> 35:16.747
We all just need to go home.

35:16.765 --> 35:19.586
All of us just need to go home.

35:20.241 --> 35:21.681
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

35:21.699 --> 35:24.353
- Really? - Okay, then, um,
does that mean that we can have

35:24.371 --> 35:26.721
a proper birthday party for Evan,

35:26.746 --> 35:28.070
- because...
- What are you talking about, proper?

35:28.087 --> 35:29.429
It was tragic. It...

35:29.448 --> 35:30.950
That birthday party was pathetic.

35:30.968 --> 35:32.856
- You guys are making me
feel really bad. - Yeah.

35:32.877 --> 35:35.030
- Store-bought cupcakes...
- It was completely...

35:35.047 --> 35:35.870
- You know, that will kill you...
- It was so lame.

35:35.888 --> 35:38.383
- You know what? They were organic.
- You know what?

35:38.407 --> 35:40.143
- Organic, my foot.
- There was a giant elephant in the room,

35:40.161 --> 35:42.014
and we were all pretending
it wasn't there.

35:42.063 --> 35:44.351
What are you talking about?

35:52.645 --> 35:56.446
Remember being exhausted from
just drinking all night?

35:56.479 --> 35:59.199
Oh, and dancing.
Remember dancing?

35:59.217 --> 36:01.026
No, but I wasn't good
at it anyway.

36:05.971 --> 36:08.546
How long do you think we're
gonna have to sleep in there?

36:08.563 --> 36:10.783
The fort? I don't know, but
I'll tell you one thing.

36:10.801 --> 36:12.878
I would not have done
well in the civil war.

36:12.883 --> 36:15.534
Good morning. How's it going?

36:15.553 --> 36:18.222
Morning. Well, aren't you
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed?

36:18.239 --> 36:20.031
- Why wouldn't I be?
- Mm.

36:20.063 --> 36:23.048
- Scotty, can you help me iron
my outfit for the party? - Sure.

36:23.066 --> 36:25.368
- Great.
- W-wait a minute.

36:25.386 --> 36:27.080
Aren't you using the ironing board

36:27.098 --> 36:29.080
as one of the major support
beams in Gecko Town?

36:29.098 --> 36:31.624
- It's okay. I took it down.
- The fort?

36:31.655 --> 36:33.929
Yeah. Zemulon thought
it was too crowded.

36:35.335 --> 36:36.743
Well, how do you feel about that?

36:36.776 --> 36:38.567
It's... it's fine. Let it go.

36:38.585 --> 36:41.000
Right. Okay.
I'll be up in a minute.

36:41.019 --> 36:41.896
Thanks.

36:43.527 --> 36:45.208
Yes. It worked.

36:45.240 --> 36:47.240
Good-bye, Gecko Town.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.936
And then we made
croque monsieurs.

36:50.968 --> 36:52.775
You know what those are?

36:52.793 --> 36:55.640
I got it.
Uh, ham and cheese thingies?

36:55.657 --> 36:56.888
Yeah, only better.

36:56.919 --> 36:58.870
And we were gonna make
croque madames,

36:58.876 --> 37:00.823
but we ran out of eggs.

37:00.856 --> 37:04.743
Yeah, Paige, uh, we don't have
to tell your mom everything.

37:04.761 --> 37:07.095
That will be
our little secret, huh?

37:08.406 --> 37:10.919
Oh, chicken.

37:11.815 --> 37:14.520
You sure you're not too
upset about this dance?

37:14.538 --> 37:17.846
I was, but... I'm over it.

37:17.864 --> 37:19.816
And Cody's not that cute.

37:20.464 --> 37:22.897
You're right.
No one's that cute.

37:23.841 --> 37:26.991
Oh, wait, wait.
Do you think that if we freeze this,

37:27.012 --> 37:28.511
it'll keep till next month?

37:28.530 --> 37:30.734
No, I don't think so. Why?

37:30.754 --> 37:33.755
Well, there's a father-daughter
dance at school,

37:33.773 --> 37:36.027
and dad's gonna be out of town,

37:36.044 --> 37:38.748
so I was hoping that
Luc would go with me.

37:39.595 --> 37:41.531
Oh, I will... I will be honored.

37:41.563 --> 37:43.994
- Maybe we could buy him a new one.
- Okay.

37:45.113 --> 37:46.650
Can I see your dress?

37:46.683 --> 37:48.554
Oh, my God. It's gorgeous.

37:48.571 --> 37:50.239
And... and Tiffany's gonna
let me wear it again.

37:50.256 --> 37:51.102
I'll go get it.

37:55.886 --> 37:58.174
Sounds like you two
had quite the weekend.

37:58.207 --> 38:01.327
Well, it was a bumpy start,
but it turned out to be okay.

38:01.358 --> 38:04.483
I was so frustrated,
not being here for all of this.

38:05.731 --> 38:07.637
But it kind of turns out,
I didn't need to be.

38:12.421 --> 38:13.065
I love you.

38:13.802 --> 38:15.802
Not as much as I love you.

38:19.069 --> 38:20.783
How many of those things
are you making?

38:20.803 --> 38:24.137
- I am making two dozen.
- Oh.

38:24.154 --> 38:25.797
Why don't you go in
and ask Kitty and Evan

38:25.816 --> 38:27.094
if they're about ready to go?

38:27.100 --> 38:28.485
I have to change my clothes, too.

38:28.491 --> 38:29.925
Um, sure.

38:32.245 --> 38:33.701
Are you all right?

38:34.421 --> 38:36.534
Um, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

38:36.551 --> 38:38.039
I'm just, uh, just a little tired.

38:38.070 --> 38:39.257
Well, why didn't you
say something?

38:39.270 --> 38:41.014
I wouldn't have asked you to
pick us up at the airport.

38:41.031 --> 38:43.639
Oh, no, come on.
I'm here to serve.

38:43.657 --> 38:45.143
What does that mean?

38:47.173 --> 38:48.759
All right, mom, look,
how do you do it?

38:49.240 --> 38:51.208
For real, like how do you...
how do you

38:51.225 --> 38:54.701
take care of all of us and
feed other people's dogs

38:54.717 --> 38:57.004
- and... - You were the one
that took care of Lily.

38:57.022 --> 38:58.621
Okay, right.
So we're both here to serve.

38:58.638 --> 39:01.196
I mean, how do you not
have a nervous breakdown?

39:01.214 --> 39:02.908
Where is this coming from?

39:03.932 --> 39:06.108
Ah, it's a long story.

39:06.114 --> 39:10.061
Justin, it's a great thing to
want to try to help people.

39:10.069 --> 39:12.372
But you can't always blame yourself

39:12.390 --> 39:13.717
when you're not able to succeed.

39:13.734 --> 39:15.477
And you know who
taught me that? You.

39:16.613 --> 39:17.555
I did?

39:17.587 --> 39:21.059
Yes. During your intervention

39:21.091 --> 39:22.672
when drugs came back
into your life,

39:22.677 --> 39:24.339
- and you and I were sitting
down by the pool... - Yeah.

39:24.355 --> 39:27.489
And you turned to me and
said I had to let you go,

39:27.521 --> 39:29.729
that I couldn't feel
responsible for you anymore,

39:29.762 --> 39:31.681
that you had to do it yourself.

39:32.282 --> 39:34.178
Uh, yeah,
I remember that, mom.

39:35.516 --> 39:37.772
Thank you for remembering.

39:38.411 --> 39:40.730
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

39:40.751 --> 39:43.883
All right. I'm gonna, uh,
go get the birthday boy.

39:45.238 --> 39:49.414
- Wow. Lots of presents.
- Right?

39:49.446 --> 39:51.527
- Well, you just wait until your birthday.
- Yeah.

39:51.558 --> 39:54.791
Are you ready for your first
Walker party, Olivia?

39:54.810 --> 39:56.593
I remember my first Walker party.

39:56.610 --> 39:58.631
- Oh, my God.
- I drank a lot of wine.

39:58.649 --> 40:00.967
- Yeah, you did.
- Does that mean I get to drink wine?

40:00.984 --> 40:02.227
- No.
- Are you crazy?

40:02.259 --> 40:04.689
Oh, let's show Olivia what we do
with presents in this family.

40:04.721 --> 40:07.836
- Oh, yeah. Oh, okay.
- Go. Oh, okay.

40:07.854 --> 40:09.648
- Ooh, robot.
- Stuffed monkey.

40:09.667 --> 40:12.255
- Uh, socks. Very boring.
- Uh, an Olivia?

40:13.232 --> 40:16.976
- Uh-oh.
- I think I hear a birthday boy!

40:16.995 --> 40:18.736
- Hi, Uncle noodles.
- Hey, buddy.

40:18.755 --> 40:21.169
Hi. How you doing, buddy?

40:21.187 --> 40:23.697
- Hi, Uncle noodles.
- How are you?

40:23.745 --> 40:28.817
Uh, listen, I-I need someone
to help me f-r-o-s-t these...

40:28.835 --> 40:30.769
- I got it. I got it. I got this.
- Take it.

40:30.787 --> 40:34.034
Hey, Evan, let's go see that piñata
I've heard so much about.

40:34.052 --> 40:36.561
So you want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

40:36.567 --> 40:38.817
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

40:38.850 --> 40:40.961
We'll go for a walk later,
and I'll tell you everything.

40:41.697 --> 40:42.471
Okay.

40:42.503 --> 40:44.743
- Come meet Olivia.
- Oh.

40:45.440 --> 40:48.865
Oh, Olivia is just so adorable, Kevin.

40:48.897 --> 40:51.953
I know. I just... I want
to squeeze those cheeks.

40:51.985 --> 40:55.009
Would you please leave
my daughter's cheeks alone?

40:55.026 --> 40:57.953
Aw. Your daughter.

41:00.341 --> 41:02.459
Aw. Don't worry,
you're gonna have a kid one day.

41:02.491 --> 41:04.241
I think we should start him
slow, though, like a fish.

41:04.259 --> 41:06.433
- Oh, maybe a plant.
- A plastic one. - Nice.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.769
So, Olivia, I heard you're
starting at my old school.

41:08.787 --> 41:10.336
- Are you nervous?
- Kinda.

41:10.355 --> 41:12.624
It's not that scary,
but you... you have to get.

41:12.641 --> 41:15.007
Mrs. Earl for math.
She looks pretty mean,

41:15.025 --> 41:16.251
but she's actually the nicest

41:16.270 --> 41:19.133
- teacher in the whole school...
- Look at them.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.871
It's the next generation of Walkers.

41:23.489 --> 41:26.456
- Yay!
- Oh, the party's on.

41:26.475 --> 41:28.423
These are for later.
We're gonna have fun now.

41:29.287 --> 41:31.235
Let me see. Hey, baby.

41:31.240 --> 41:32.467
Give Evan a stick.

41:32.485 --> 41:33.812
Ready?

41:39.107 --> 41:40.771
Evan! Evan!

41:40.789 --> 41:44.099
All right, bud.
All right, here we go. Ready?

41:44.116 --> 41:46.464
- One, two... Three.
- Go get the stick and hit it.

41:49.147 --> 41:51.287
Quick! Pictures!
