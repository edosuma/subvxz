WEBVTT

00:00.914 --> 00:02.303
Previously on The Resident...

00:02.339 --> 00:06.035
Facing our new reality, the Cain
Center for Neurosurgery.

00:06.071 --> 00:08.172
- There's good news.
- My cancer's in remission.

00:08.207 --> 00:09.644
I have a shot at getting my life back.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.264
Dr. Torres here is a magician in the OR.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.367
Go be one of those celebrity TV doctors,

00:14.403 --> 00:16.913
make a lot of money, wear nice
clothes. You'd be great at it.

00:16.949 --> 00:18.081
Three different patients.

00:18.116 --> 00:20.684
All with organophosphate
poisoning, all on 3B Life.

00:20.719 --> 00:22.493
The only link that we do have
is your supplement.

00:22.529 --> 00:24.195
We need to call public
health and warn them about it.

00:24.231 --> 00:25.488
That's ridiculously premature.

00:25.524 --> 00:27.179
But if we wait, people could die.

00:27.292 --> 00:29.556
- Dr. Hawkins, welcome back.
- Nice to be back.

00:29.592 --> 00:31.495
Leaving me out of the loop on Hawkins

00:31.530 --> 00:32.755
is a sign of disrespect to the surgeon

00:32.791 --> 00:35.979
who's made more rain for you
and Red Rock than anyone else.

00:36.015 --> 00:39.316
Not as much as you used to.
Everyone has an expiration date.

00:42.439 --> 00:43.901
Good morning, everyone.

00:44.276 --> 00:45.989
Today, we open up the doors

00:46.025 --> 00:49.879
to the most advanced neurological
institute this country's ever seen.

00:51.917 --> 00:54.131
Or at least the most expensive.

00:54.553 --> 00:56.520
Red Rocks stands
to make $1 million a day

00:56.555 --> 00:57.888
on surgeries alone.

00:57.923 --> 01:00.190
No wonder they were so
quick to open this place.

01:00.225 --> 01:01.592
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:01.627 --> 01:02.693
You hungry?

01:02.728 --> 01:04.760
I'm not here to eat, I'm here to work.

01:04.796 --> 01:07.397
Red Rock packed in so many
patients, they need more nurses.

01:07.432 --> 01:09.533
I've got a bad feeling about this place.

01:09.743 --> 01:12.008
I'd like to extend a warm
welcome to all of our donors

01:12.044 --> 01:13.136
I see out here today.

01:13.172 --> 01:16.685
It's your investment in the future
that's made this institute possible.

01:17.109 --> 01:19.309
Well, if it makes you feel any
better, today's my admin day,

01:19.344 --> 01:21.726
so I'm stuck on desk duty.

01:21.762 --> 01:24.730
- All papers, no patients.
- Well, you know what they say,

01:25.284 --> 01:28.600
"With great power,
comes boring responsibilities."

01:28.636 --> 01:29.902
You have an office,

01:29.938 --> 01:31.321
Chief Resident. I have no pity.

01:31.356 --> 01:33.257
You have no idea how
bad I am at scheduling.

01:33.632 --> 01:34.725
Please, come help me.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.493
- Nope.
- Out.

01:36.829 --> 01:39.596
The brain is the new frontier for us.

01:39.854 --> 01:41.465
Treatment and diagnosis...

01:41.500 --> 01:43.467
I feel like I'm sending
you off to the wolves.

01:43.962 --> 01:45.102
I'll be fine.

01:45.137 --> 01:47.271
It's the wolves I'm worried
about, not you.

01:48.372 --> 01:49.729
It's gonna be thrilling,

01:49.853 --> 01:51.775
- but most importantly...
- Hey.

01:51.810 --> 01:53.277
...it's gonna be groundbreaking.

01:53.312 --> 01:54.331
Go get 'em.

01:54.780 --> 01:56.174
Thank you all for being here today.

01:56.210 --> 01:58.678
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go scrub in.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:08.847 --> 02:10.271
Is it me or is it cold in here?

02:10.308 --> 02:11.528
Yeah, I already called maintenance.

02:11.563 --> 02:13.196
They said it should be warming up soon.

02:13.231 --> 02:14.665
Anyone know where
the butterfly needles are?

02:14.700 --> 02:16.533
I think I saw them in the supply closet.

02:16.568 --> 02:18.013
Top shelf, far right.

02:18.049 --> 02:19.136
Ah.

02:19.171 --> 02:22.090
Sorry. I'm still getting the
hang of this new EMR software.

02:22.126 --> 02:23.140
It hates me.

02:23.175 --> 02:25.142
I gave up and faxed in a request.

02:25.177 --> 02:26.843
- Faxed?
- Girl's got to do.

02:29.982 --> 02:31.448
Um, I'll be right back.

02:33.611 --> 02:34.894
Annie.

02:35.900 --> 02:38.620
Nic. Oh, no, don't worry,

02:38.656 --> 02:41.725
I'm not a patient.
Still cancer-free, thankfully.

02:41.761 --> 02:43.358
I'm here with Lucy.

02:43.895 --> 02:45.963
Lucy, this is Nurse Nevin.

02:45.998 --> 02:47.798
She helped me through my own surgery.

02:47.833 --> 02:49.032
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:49.067 --> 02:50.284
It's nice to meet you.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.252
I started fostering a few months ago.

02:52.704 --> 02:54.571
Thought about doing it
for years, but I guess

02:54.606 --> 02:56.640
cancer was the kick in
the pants that I needed.

02:56.675 --> 02:58.906
Oh, that's amazing. What brings you in?

02:58.942 --> 03:00.676
Headaches, throwing up,

03:00.791 --> 03:03.158
tingly feet... Should I keep going?

03:03.248 --> 03:04.987
The doctors found a brain tumor

03:05.023 --> 03:06.823
a little over a year before I met Lucy.

03:06.952 --> 03:08.685
Because of the size and the location,

03:08.720 --> 03:10.921
they said that a watch
and wait approach was best

03:10.956 --> 03:12.954
- until it got worse.
- Which it did.

03:13.344 --> 03:14.391
A few days ago,

03:14.427 --> 03:17.059
Lucy fainted in the cafeteria
at school during lunch.

03:17.095 --> 03:19.514
I took out half of the
salad bar on my way down.

03:19.898 --> 03:21.565
My hair still smells like ranch.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.867
But they did an MRI,
and now we're just waiting

03:23.902 --> 03:25.902
to hear back on the surgical plan.

03:26.071 --> 03:28.572
Well, it says here, uh,
that she's scheduled

03:28.607 --> 03:30.800
for a tumor resection this afternoon

03:30.836 --> 03:33.837
with... Dr. Cain.

03:34.112 --> 03:35.161
Of course.

03:35.197 --> 03:37.748
The surgeon who saved me
operating on my little girl

03:38.378 --> 03:40.183
in this amazing new hospital.

03:40.627 --> 03:42.870
I'm really glad she's in good hands.

03:45.891 --> 03:48.391
Why don't I join Lucy's team today?

03:50.929 --> 03:52.696
- Yeah, we'd love that.
- Yeah.

03:52.859 --> 03:54.630
Great. Me, too.

04:02.599 --> 04:05.599
<font color="#741b47">Sync & corrections by </font><font color="#ead1dc">emeline-whovian</font>
<font color="#741b47">www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:09.481 --> 04:11.615
I'm looking forward to operating
with you again, Dr. Okafor.

04:11.757 --> 04:13.884
First, we need to get in and out
of this patient's room

04:13.919 --> 04:16.586
- as quickly as possible.
- I prefer to take my time.

04:16.620 --> 04:18.255
Really get to know a patient
before surgery.

04:18.521 --> 04:19.956
Where they're from, what they do.

04:19.991 --> 04:21.625
- Clearly he hasn't met them yet.
- Nope.

04:21.660 --> 04:22.803
Enough!

04:23.029 --> 04:24.867
The entire hospital can hear you.

04:24.903 --> 04:26.306
Would you give it a rest?

04:27.866 --> 04:30.967
Professor, this is Dr. Torres.
He'll be joining our team.

04:31.002 --> 04:32.269
It's a pleasure to meet...

04:32.304 --> 04:36.239
Listen. All day he crunches,

04:36.688 --> 04:38.275
piles up his dirty clothes,

04:38.310 --> 04:40.944
orders take-out at all
hours to stink up my room.

04:40.979 --> 04:43.158
- Our room.
- Oh, now you can hear me?

04:43.194 --> 04:45.015
They both have end stage heart failure,

04:45.050 --> 04:46.783
and they both need a heart.

04:46.818 --> 04:50.353
Same blood type, heart size,
and immune system compatibility.

04:50.388 --> 04:51.820
But that's all they have in common.

04:52.023 --> 04:54.183
My side, my rules.

04:54.675 --> 04:55.975
Hey, check it out.

04:56.298 --> 04:59.463
I just finished this one.
It's part of my series.

04:59.873 --> 05:01.131
I call it,

05:01.166 --> 05:03.033
"Angry Little Man Who

05:03.068 --> 05:05.035
Definitely Needs to Chill."

05:05.070 --> 05:06.599
- Nice.
- I'm an artist.

05:06.635 --> 05:08.989
Yeah, if no one pays you, it's a hobby.

05:09.025 --> 05:10.692
Oh, come on, Professor.

05:10.728 --> 05:12.455
Real artists don't do it for the cash,

05:12.491 --> 05:14.311
they do it to help
show people the truth.

05:14.346 --> 05:17.013
Hey, that's right.
I make art to move people.

05:17.048 --> 05:19.816
Why don't you find yourself
moving to a different room?

05:20.764 --> 05:22.770
I swear, if I have to spend
another day in here...

05:22.806 --> 05:25.222
You don't. We're here
because a donor heart

05:25.257 --> 05:26.556
is on its way from Savannah.

05:26.591 --> 05:27.958
And since you're top of the list,

05:27.993 --> 05:29.793
we've got you scheduled
for surgery later today.

05:29.828 --> 05:32.093
Thank God.

05:32.497 --> 05:34.467
I was worried that if I died in here,

05:34.503 --> 05:36.770
that kid's face would be
the last thing I ever saw.

05:37.469 --> 05:38.868
You should be so lucky.

05:44.514 --> 05:46.076
Thank you for having me on.

05:46.977 --> 05:48.478
Don't thank me.

05:48.513 --> 05:51.381
Your publicist called in
a favor at network.

05:51.912 --> 05:52.916
And we're back

05:52.951 --> 05:56.553
in five, four, three...

06:00.425 --> 06:02.526
Anyone tired? Want more energy?

06:02.561 --> 06:04.033
Yes!

06:04.069 --> 06:07.097
Yes, of course you do.
Well, my next guest says that

06:07.132 --> 06:09.900
his new supplement might
be just the thing for you.

06:09.935 --> 06:13.603
Dr. Bell, there are a lot
of supplements out there.

06:13.638 --> 06:15.536
What makes 3B Life different?

06:15.754 --> 06:18.875
3B Life is a proprietary
blend of nutrients

06:18.910 --> 06:21.211
designed to fortify your whole body.

06:21.246 --> 06:24.128
- I take it myself every day.
- I figured you did,

06:24.164 --> 06:26.283
or you wouldn't have put
your face on the bottle.

06:27.752 --> 06:29.864
Yeah, uh...

06:30.255 --> 06:33.456
You know, I've worked
in hospitals for 40 years,

06:33.491 --> 06:35.358
and I'm sorry to say,

06:35.393 --> 06:39.129
we are unhealthier today
than ever before.

06:39.164 --> 06:41.598
Half of all Americans are uninsured.

06:41.633 --> 06:43.700
And, you know, I remember
a young man came in

06:43.735 --> 06:45.569
with liver failure,
and he was uninsured,

06:45.604 --> 06:47.317
and couldn't afford a doctor's visit,

06:47.353 --> 06:49.532
so there was nobody there to tell him

06:49.941 --> 06:51.741
that his disease could be easily managed

06:51.776 --> 06:54.248
with lifestyle and diet, and by the time

06:54.284 --> 06:55.883
he came in...

06:58.373 --> 06:59.457
It's too late.

06:59.493 --> 07:02.471
Yeah, and I see so
many patients like that.

07:02.507 --> 07:04.921
People that want to take
control of their own health,

07:04.956 --> 07:07.762
but they... they just don't know how.

07:07.798 --> 07:10.560
And they don't know
who to trust. And that's...

07:11.665 --> 07:13.229
that's why my face is on the bottle.

07:21.983 --> 07:22.964
Hello?

07:23.112 --> 07:26.819
You were great. Very real. Very human.

07:28.046 --> 07:29.287
Regina.

07:36.154 --> 07:37.354
You all right?

07:37.949 --> 07:39.923
Remember the patients
from Atlanta General

07:39.958 --> 07:41.825
with organophosphate poisoning?

07:41.860 --> 07:44.694
The ones that may have taken 3B Life?

07:45.499 --> 07:46.529
Why?

07:47.038 --> 07:48.472
One of them just died.

07:50.302 --> 07:52.769
- This is not our fault.
- I need you to both relax.

07:52.804 --> 07:54.371
Well, you didn't just go
on national television

07:54.406 --> 07:55.772
and tell two million people

07:55.807 --> 07:57.774
that 3B Life is the best
thing since penicillin.

07:57.809 --> 07:59.476
Okay, you don't actually
think that our product

07:59.511 --> 08:00.920
caused a man's death?

08:01.646 --> 08:03.967
No. I don't want to believe
that we're responsible

08:04.003 --> 08:05.137
any more than you do.

08:05.173 --> 08:07.384
What happened has nothing
to do with our product.

08:07.419 --> 08:09.219
We tested our facility. It's clean.

08:09.254 --> 08:10.854
- Our ingredients are safe.
- I know.

08:10.889 --> 08:12.222
I know they are.

08:12.788 --> 08:14.891
I'm just gonna see if I can get
the man's records sent over

08:14.926 --> 08:16.326
from Atlanta General just to confirm

08:16.361 --> 08:17.725
whether or not he was even taking 3B.

08:17.761 --> 08:20.136
Social media's blowing up
about your Pierce appearance.

08:20.432 --> 08:23.867
Mentions on Facebook are strong.
Twitter, same.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.502
Even the trolls like you.

08:25.537 --> 08:27.762
So you can expect a surge in sales.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.266
No, no. Let's just delay shipments...

08:30.302 --> 08:32.352
Stopping shipments could
make people ask questions.

08:32.388 --> 08:34.352
Well, that's a chance
we have to take. I...

08:34.634 --> 08:35.879
We have to exercise

08:35.914 --> 08:37.313
an overabundance of caution

08:37.349 --> 08:38.815
on the small possibility

08:38.850 --> 08:40.417
that we may have injured someone.

08:40.884 --> 08:42.580
I am sorry a man died,

08:42.616 --> 08:44.694
but it could've been
an allergic reaction,

08:44.730 --> 08:45.803
or an underlying condition.

08:45.839 --> 08:47.324
Who knows, maybe it was just his time.

08:47.359 --> 08:48.525
Well, maybe isn't good enough.

08:50.203 --> 08:51.612
I need to check on the others.

08:52.042 --> 08:55.244
- Others?
- Let's just get back to Chastain.

09:01.716 --> 09:04.765
Hey! I saw you on TV this morning.

09:06.431 --> 09:07.897
You make us proud, Dr. B.

09:11.020 --> 09:13.020
I'll catch up with you
in a couple minutes.

09:23.248 --> 09:24.773
How'd you get his medical records?

09:24.809 --> 09:26.140
A friend at Atlanta General.

09:26.175 --> 09:28.375
The autopsy will happen later today.

09:28.410 --> 09:31.378
30-year-old male. Diagnosed
with organophosphate poisoning.

09:31.413 --> 09:33.303
Treated with atropine, 2-PAM.

09:33.949 --> 09:37.482
Full recovery, until this morning.

09:37.518 --> 09:38.984
Yeah, he was about to be discharged,

09:39.020 --> 09:40.955
they found him in cardiac arrest.

09:40.990 --> 09:43.490
- And what am I looking for?
- Anything unusual,

09:43.525 --> 09:46.560
an allergic reaction,
some underlying condition

09:46.595 --> 09:47.929
that might've caused his death.

09:47.965 --> 09:50.002
You mean something other
than your supplement?

09:50.599 --> 09:52.764
Look, I've reviewed all their files

09:52.800 --> 09:54.885
looking for any another possible cause.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.972
I just, I'd like you
to re-examine all three.

09:58.007 --> 10:00.674
Dr. Pravesh already did
a very thorough workup,

10:00.709 --> 10:02.625
- detailed history...
- You have a way of

10:03.278 --> 10:05.008
seeing what other doctors miss.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.581
Just take another look,
that's all I'm asking you to do.

10:07.616 --> 10:11.852
If I found out it's 3B Life,
you know I won't keep quiet.

10:13.021 --> 10:14.154
I need to know.

10:16.247 --> 10:18.335
Let's just try and make
sure nobody else dies.

10:22.969 --> 10:25.833
I'll be awake for the surgery?

10:26.250 --> 10:28.268
Your brain tumor is
near your speech center.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.138
Being awake allows me to avoid
the brain tissue which is

10:31.173 --> 10:32.539
critical to your ability to speak.

10:33.328 --> 10:36.043
But you'll be able to talk
and see what's going on.

10:36.354 --> 10:38.958
- Will it hurt?
- No. You won't feel a thing.

10:39.329 --> 10:40.929
There are no pain
receptors in your brain.

10:41.050 --> 10:42.116
Well, that's good.

10:42.151 --> 10:43.484
What if I have to sneeze?

10:43.917 --> 10:45.686
Then we'll get you a tissue.

10:47.226 --> 10:48.932
Now, I'd like to be there with her.

10:49.125 --> 10:51.379
I'm sorry. There are
no family members allowed.

10:51.869 --> 10:53.360
But you'll be there, right?

10:53.395 --> 10:54.594
Absolutely.

10:58.267 --> 10:59.820
I'm sure we can arrange something.

11:11.488 --> 11:14.915
I can't believe my new heart
is actually in the building.

11:14.950 --> 11:16.230
Your long wait is over.

11:16.266 --> 11:18.352
We've seen your heart,
and it looks perfect.

11:18.387 --> 11:19.877
Oh, thank you.

11:21.244 --> 11:22.356
You're a little warm.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.999
Ah, I feel fine.
It's probably just excitement.

11:26.627 --> 11:28.095
Yeah. Probably.

11:28.130 --> 11:29.930
We'll check back on you soon, all right?

11:32.030 --> 11:34.268
The professor's temp is 100.1 now.

11:34.303 --> 11:36.236
If it reaches 100.4,
we'll have to temporarily

11:36.271 --> 11:37.838
take him off the transplant list.

11:37.873 --> 11:38.872
All right. Get two cultures

11:38.907 --> 11:40.240
and start him on empiric antibiotics.

11:40.275 --> 11:42.443
- I don't want to take a chance.
- It could just be a bad reaction

11:42.478 --> 11:44.011
to one of the medications.

11:44.046 --> 11:46.380
Maybe. But we need to keep
a close eye on him

11:46.415 --> 11:47.822
over the next few hours.

11:48.217 --> 11:49.269
Hey.

11:49.818 --> 11:51.618
- Hey.
- Sorry, am I interrupting?

11:51.653 --> 11:53.021
Not at all. We just finished.

11:54.801 --> 11:57.725
Okay, tonight I am
drinking all the drinks.

11:57.991 --> 12:01.061
Oh. What's wrong?

12:01.096 --> 12:02.291
What isn't?

12:09.598 --> 12:11.138
I want Chem-7s every four hours.

12:11.173 --> 12:13.707
Strict ins and outs. Page me
with any new symptoms.

12:13.742 --> 12:16.176
If anyone sneezes,
I want to hear about it.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.613
You think I missed something?

12:19.648 --> 12:22.583
No. Everything I've seen
indicates you made

12:22.618 --> 12:24.912
the right diagnosis and gave
all three the right treatments.

12:24.948 --> 12:26.414
Then why reevaluate?

12:27.899 --> 12:29.488
- Bell.
- Yeah.

12:30.303 --> 12:32.092
He is looking for a way out.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.827
- Mm, maybe.
- I know that he had your back

12:33.862 --> 12:36.063
when you got fired,
but the man has gone from CEO

12:36.098 --> 12:38.565
and chief of surgery to the basement.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.167
How long until he goes back
to being the guy

12:40.202 --> 12:42.803
that would do anything
to save his own skin?

12:42.838 --> 12:44.438
I say we give him
the benefit of the doubt.

12:44.473 --> 12:47.474
Right now, people taking
Bell's supplement are in danger

12:47.509 --> 12:49.559
of getting just as sick as these three.

12:49.595 --> 12:51.912
Once you discovered
they were all taking 3B Life,

12:51.947 --> 12:54.081
how many more questions did you ask?

12:54.116 --> 12:56.183
- I'd made the connection.
- I get it. I probably wouldn't

12:56.218 --> 12:57.785
have asked any more questions, either.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.654
But now someone's dead,
so we have to. You with me?

13:04.945 --> 13:06.856
All right. Let's go fishing.

13:12.088 --> 13:12.966
Wait.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.535
It was the supplement?

13:14.570 --> 13:16.203
That's what I get for buying

13:16.238 --> 13:17.971
something from the shopping channel.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.439
I buy stuff from there all the time.

13:19.474 --> 13:21.181
Just bought the kids a trampoline.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.509
You think we can get a refund?

13:22.544 --> 13:24.711
We're not positive it was
3B Life that made you sick.

13:24.746 --> 13:27.281
For now, don't take it again.

13:27.316 --> 13:28.549
Oh, I feel fine.

13:28.584 --> 13:30.398
The nurse said I was
just about to be discharged.

13:30.434 --> 13:33.019
The food here is making me retain water.

13:33.722 --> 13:36.100
I can't be puffy before my next shoot.

13:36.136 --> 13:37.958
My oldest is in the school play.

13:37.993 --> 13:40.828
And if I leave now,
I might be able to make it.

13:41.011 --> 13:44.145
A patient at a another hospital
who was on 3B Life, they...

13:45.697 --> 13:47.306
...they recently passed away.

13:48.937 --> 13:50.270
Oh, my God.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.707
Now, this didn't happen at Chastain,

13:53.742 --> 13:55.475
so we have limited information.

13:55.510 --> 13:57.811
Whoa. So you think we're in danger?

13:57.846 --> 14:00.546
It is possible. Now,
this man initially recovered

14:00.582 --> 14:01.947
after treatment just like all of you,

14:01.983 --> 14:04.245
so that has us concerned
that you could relapse

14:04.281 --> 14:05.586
and get very sick again.

14:05.621 --> 14:08.006
Which is why we need
you to stick around,

14:08.042 --> 14:09.156
so we can monitor you.

14:09.191 --> 14:10.542
And fill out these questionnaires

14:10.578 --> 14:11.725
about your last two weeks.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.027
I know there's a lot in there,
it's annoying.

14:14.062 --> 14:17.386
But we need you to be
as detailed as humanly possible.

14:17.635 --> 14:18.632
This is vital.

14:18.668 --> 14:20.983
You expect me to remember
what I ate five days ago?

14:21.019 --> 14:23.294
And what kind of pesticides
are used on my neighbor's lawn?

14:23.330 --> 14:25.205
Look, I get it. This seems ridiculous,

14:25.240 --> 14:28.108
but it could save your life.

14:28.585 --> 14:30.944
We need to figure out
what made you sick,

14:31.511 --> 14:34.615
and if this has to do
with 3B Life or not.

14:34.905 --> 14:38.285
Every detail matters
for you guys right now.

14:39.365 --> 14:41.488
I can't believe I paid
for express shipping.

14:45.272 --> 14:47.331
Please, Dr. Okafor. Take it again.

14:47.367 --> 14:49.379
- It's not gonna change.
- Try.

14:49.504 --> 14:52.466
Sorry, Professor,
but you have a bona fide fever.

14:52.502 --> 14:53.767
Which means that we're gonna have to put

14:53.802 --> 14:55.302
your transplant surgery on pause.

14:56.152 --> 14:58.702
But I've been waiting here for months.

14:59.574 --> 15:02.276
My heart has finally arrived. Please.

15:02.311 --> 15:04.878
If it's an infection, the immune
suppression that you require

15:04.913 --> 15:06.914
after the transplant might be fatal.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.415
We have to wait for the fever to go down

15:08.450 --> 15:10.050
and for your blood culture results.

15:10.425 --> 15:12.819
Okay. Okay, t-then we wait.

15:12.854 --> 15:17.157
Yes, but, unfortunately,
the heart can't wait.

15:17.192 --> 15:18.915
By the time we get your results,

15:19.194 --> 15:21.128
the heart will no longer be viable.

15:21.163 --> 15:23.577
We're sorry, Professor. We really are.

15:23.773 --> 15:26.600
The donor heart will
have to go to the next

15:26.635 --> 15:28.411
recipient on the list.

15:33.334 --> 15:34.708
Oh, no.

15:36.044 --> 15:38.239
What? Why is everyone looking at me?

15:39.848 --> 15:41.893
Doug, how are those questions coming?

15:51.526 --> 15:53.898
Doug, can you hear me?

15:55.964 --> 15:58.185
Call a code blue! We need help in here!

15:58.967 --> 16:01.968
Code blue, room 5916.

16:03.805 --> 16:05.205
What the hell happened?

16:05.240 --> 16:06.373
I don't know. We both just saw him.

16:06.408 --> 16:07.574
He was fine five minutes ago.

16:10.145 --> 16:11.711
Okay, pads are on. Pads are on.

16:12.714 --> 16:14.114
V fib. Charge to 200.

16:14.149 --> 16:15.315
And clear. Shock.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.719
All right. Come on.

16:28.392 --> 16:30.100
Uh, I'll go check on Cynthia.

16:30.324 --> 16:32.371
I'll see what's going on with Raj.

16:34.266 --> 16:35.499
Thank you.

16:35.534 --> 16:37.501
Update.

16:37.536 --> 16:40.101
We put Mr. Corson back
on atropine and 2-PAM.

16:40.137 --> 16:42.973
This is exactly what happened
to the guy at Atlanta General.

16:43.008 --> 16:45.142
He seemed to be getting better
then, all of a sudden,

16:45.177 --> 16:46.476
- he crashed.
- What about the other two?

16:46.511 --> 16:48.845
Scared, but okay for now.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.584
And 3B Life still appears
to be the only possible cause.

16:51.627 --> 16:53.060
We don't know that for sure.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.796
The only way to be certain

16:54.832 --> 16:58.200
that you're not risking more
lives is to issue a recall.

16:58.236 --> 17:00.057
When patients get the right
diagnosis and treatment,

17:00.092 --> 17:01.825
they don't usually recover
and then get worse.

17:01.860 --> 17:04.920
And why is only one of these
three reacting like this?

17:05.797 --> 17:07.263
Well, every person has a different

17:07.299 --> 17:08.982
physiological response to poison.

17:09.018 --> 17:11.867
Organophosphates are known
to have an intermediate syndrome

17:11.903 --> 17:13.377
that show up a day or two later.

17:13.779 --> 17:15.445
I think something changed
between the time

17:15.482 --> 17:17.553
Doug finished his treatment
and when he coded.

17:18.369 --> 17:19.576
The answer is in there somewhere.

17:19.611 --> 17:21.944
I'm gonna give Doug a trial of diuresis.

17:21.980 --> 17:23.054
Good.

17:26.342 --> 17:27.617
You all right?

17:27.988 --> 17:30.253
Well, I just heard that
St. John's brought in two cases

17:30.288 --> 17:31.688
of organophosphate poisoning
this morning.

17:31.723 --> 17:33.221
There's three more at Emory.

17:33.257 --> 17:35.391
And the more hospitals I call,
the more patients I find.

17:35.427 --> 17:37.728
And I'm-I'm not positive
they were on 3B Life...

17:37.764 --> 17:38.930
This isn't isolated.

17:39.991 --> 17:41.605
I'm gonna order some send-out labs.

17:47.802 --> 17:50.105
Hey. You're that doc on the supplement.

17:52.444 --> 17:54.322
What the hell, man? You made me sick.

17:54.847 --> 17:56.647
Hey, what's in those supplements, man?

17:56.683 --> 17:58.512
Hey. You're hurting people. Hey!

18:05.000 --> 18:06.034
Hey.

18:08.193 --> 18:11.796
Look, I know we haven't
exactly become friends, but...

18:13.031 --> 18:15.150
I'm way younger than you. Okay?

18:15.186 --> 18:16.769
So I-I totally deserve this
heart, all right?

18:16.805 --> 18:17.793
Let's go.

18:17.829 --> 18:20.615
- I have a PhD, for crying out loud.
- And I'm a late bloomer.

18:20.651 --> 18:22.418
My greatest work is still ahead of me.

18:27.179 --> 18:29.980
I thought it was supposed
to get warmer, not colder.

18:30.015 --> 18:32.782
I heard Chastain is sending over
more blanket warmers.

18:32.817 --> 18:35.286
I just had to substitute
oxacillin for Cefitaxe.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.919
I mean, the amount of money that
Red Rock spent on this place,

18:37.955 --> 18:39.794
you'd think they'd be stocked
with critical antibiotics.

18:39.830 --> 18:41.481
How many times do I have
to reboot this new software

18:41.517 --> 18:43.918
before it stops freezing up?
Should we place bets?

18:43.954 --> 18:46.770
It'll be a miracle
if we make it through the day.

18:46.806 --> 18:47.939
Where's Cain?

18:48.381 --> 18:50.715
Last week, I was
operating on a young father

18:50.751 --> 18:52.473
whose seizures were so devastating,

18:52.509 --> 18:53.713
he couldn't hold his child.

18:54.184 --> 18:56.151
- So what I did with that...
- Dr. Cain. Do you have a second?

18:57.569 --> 19:01.304
That's one of our nurses
who I will be with shortly.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.755
It's about a patient.

19:05.156 --> 19:06.200
Excuse me.

19:09.928 --> 19:12.516
I think we need to push
the surgeries a day, maybe two.

19:12.824 --> 19:14.101
And why would I do that?

19:14.137 --> 19:15.637
Because this place isn't ready.

19:15.816 --> 19:17.364
We're missing medicine, uh, I mean,

19:17.400 --> 19:19.129
the staff doesn't know
how to work the software.

19:19.164 --> 19:20.809
We can't even get
the thermostat to work.

19:20.845 --> 19:22.623
Growing pains are part of the process.

19:22.659 --> 19:24.645
This is different. Someone could die.

19:25.764 --> 19:27.587
Everything seems to be
running smoothly to me.

19:27.914 --> 19:29.580
That's because you're distracted.
You're more focused

19:29.616 --> 19:31.722
on the donors than you are
on your patients, like Lucy.

19:31.758 --> 19:34.568
I will handle both.
And I will see you in the OR.

19:40.578 --> 19:42.379
Are you ready for one of these?

19:42.621 --> 19:44.287
Ew.

19:44.770 --> 19:46.870
I love it. We'll match.

19:47.292 --> 19:48.605
Yes, we will.

19:58.353 --> 20:00.250
- Love you.
- I love you.

20:01.740 --> 20:03.424
- Take good care of him.
- I will.

20:11.229 --> 20:12.661
I said no.

20:14.330 --> 20:18.265
When the agency asked me
if I wanted to adopt, I said no.

20:19.036 --> 20:20.890
You know, after my son passed away,

20:20.925 --> 20:23.010
I never thought
I'd ever leave the house again.

20:23.070 --> 20:25.075
Let alone raise another kid.

20:26.205 --> 20:30.231
But fostering one for a while,
I could do that.

20:31.303 --> 20:34.111
Most parents won't consider
a kid with medical problems.

20:34.147 --> 20:35.546
It's a lot to take on.

20:40.561 --> 20:43.029
You know, Lucy lost her parents

20:43.448 --> 20:45.913
in a car accident when she was four.

20:47.085 --> 20:50.430
She was bouncing around
foster homes ever since then.

20:52.857 --> 20:56.203
She never had a room of her own
until that first night with me.

20:57.215 --> 20:59.097
Sounds like Lucy has it pretty good.

20:59.795 --> 21:01.144
Me, too.

21:02.434 --> 21:04.070
I love that little girl.

21:06.218 --> 21:07.361
And now...

21:09.709 --> 21:11.901
You can't imagine life without her.

21:14.279 --> 21:16.513
She deserves a real family again.

21:21.753 --> 21:23.221
I think she found one.

21:28.291 --> 21:30.827
Man, I thought his eighth
album took it to a whole new level.

21:30.862 --> 21:32.704
- Track 14?
- Oh, yes, sir.

21:32.740 --> 21:34.873
- Where the horns come in.
- And that drum solo?

21:34.909 --> 21:36.265
It's heaven.

21:36.366 --> 21:39.269
I got to say, it's nice
to finally cut with a surgeon

21:39.304 --> 21:41.438
who appreciates a little hard bop.

21:41.473 --> 21:43.281
Dr. Okafor is not a fan?

21:43.630 --> 21:45.663
Would you believe I agreed
to be her mentor anyway?

21:45.699 --> 21:48.213
Just her mentor, huh?

21:48.663 --> 21:51.080
I kind of got the impression
the two of you were maybe more.

21:52.427 --> 21:55.669
No, our relationship is
strictly professional.

21:57.828 --> 21:58.891
Good to know.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.558
We need to start thinking
about a recall.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.064
Uh, I, um...

22:11.656 --> 22:12.951
I need to get some air.

22:12.987 --> 22:14.820
- Andrea, let's just talk.
- I-I'll be right back.

22:18.257 --> 22:19.292
So...

22:19.986 --> 22:21.404
this is where we are now.

22:22.311 --> 22:24.292
Do you want my professional opinion?

22:24.889 --> 22:26.642
We're not paying for your silence.

22:27.252 --> 22:28.375
Wait this out.

22:29.432 --> 22:30.498
We...

22:30.870 --> 22:32.837
we have one dead;
there's another critical.

22:32.873 --> 22:35.341
- When more get sick...
- If more get sick,

22:35.904 --> 22:37.078
I can help you.

22:37.463 --> 22:39.277
- How?
- We spin it.

22:39.354 --> 22:41.664
All the press needs is
a simple blood sacrifice.

22:41.700 --> 22:44.167
Someone who is close to the top
who can take the fall.

22:44.203 --> 22:45.580
You're changing the subject.

22:46.294 --> 22:47.889
Won't be you who goes broke.

22:49.707 --> 22:52.150
You're suggesting I throw Andrea
under the bus.

22:52.186 --> 22:54.686
She took advantage
of a respected doctor.

22:55.704 --> 22:56.880
You were focused on your patients.

22:56.915 --> 22:58.104
You trusted her too much.

22:58.140 --> 23:00.274
In case you hadn't noticed,
my face is on the bottle.

23:00.310 --> 23:03.690
Nobody is gonna believe
that I'm not responsible.

23:03.888 --> 23:05.397
The truth is what you make it.

23:07.579 --> 23:09.278
Getting you out of this mess you're in,

23:09.314 --> 23:10.560
this is why you pay me.

23:11.088 --> 23:13.530
It's why other people who are
in far more trouble than you

23:13.565 --> 23:14.553
have paid me.

23:15.233 --> 23:17.200
Andrea can start over again.

23:17.235 --> 23:18.348
She'll recover.

23:18.384 --> 23:19.623
You won't.

23:21.522 --> 23:24.207
Anyone who tried 3B Life
and stubbed their toe

23:24.242 --> 23:25.512
is coming after you.

23:26.057 --> 23:28.819
And the public will not be kind,
and they will never forget,

23:29.414 --> 23:30.658
unless...

23:31.034 --> 23:32.703
you let me help you.

23:45.552 --> 23:46.880
How are you feeling?

23:47.684 --> 23:48.934
I'm good.

23:49.635 --> 23:50.907
Thanks.

23:51.136 --> 23:53.604
- Probes.
- We should wait for Dr. Cain

23:53.639 --> 23:54.638
before moving forward.

23:54.673 --> 23:56.106
He told me to go ahead and start mapping

23:56.141 --> 23:57.942
- if he got held up.
- I understand, but...

23:57.977 --> 23:59.282
Mind if I join?

24:00.034 --> 24:01.312
Hi, Dr. Cain.

24:01.347 --> 24:02.560
Hello, Lucy.

24:03.468 --> 24:04.834
I'll take those.

24:14.967 --> 24:16.627
Lucy, before I remove your tumor,

24:16.662 --> 24:18.529
I'm gonna map out your brain
like we talked about.

24:18.564 --> 24:20.030
This is the part where you keep talking

24:20.065 --> 24:21.165
while I test the tissue, okay?

24:21.200 --> 24:22.681
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:24.088 --> 24:26.337
Annie told me that you sang
in your talent show.

24:26.373 --> 24:28.584
Yeah. It was so much fun.

24:28.620 --> 24:30.840
My friend Sam juggles scissors.

24:31.165 --> 24:33.299
- I sang.
- What song?

24:33.451 --> 24:35.318
"Baby Won't You Please Come Home."

24:35.530 --> 24:36.981
It's my fave.

24:37.016 --> 24:39.483
Annie says I sing it
almost as good as Bessie Smith,

24:39.518 --> 24:41.285
but I don't think I come close.

24:45.837 --> 24:46.917
How is he?

24:47.051 --> 24:49.477
Aaron's transplant went well.

24:50.982 --> 24:52.928
Well, I don't want to be envious.

24:52.964 --> 24:54.218
But I am.

24:54.709 --> 24:56.265
Your cultures came back.

24:57.002 --> 24:58.535
No obvious infection.

24:58.570 --> 25:00.057
Your fever hasn't returned.

25:00.337 --> 25:02.487
- You're back on the list.
- It's too late.

25:02.523 --> 25:04.357
When they admitted me,
the doctors told me

25:04.393 --> 25:06.327
I had maybe six months.

25:06.763 --> 25:08.559
And that was six months ago.

25:09.548 --> 25:11.405
I don't have time to wait.

25:12.122 --> 25:13.712
We don't know that.

25:14.152 --> 25:15.736
Doctors aren't fortune-tellers.

25:15.772 --> 25:18.507
You and I both know the odds
of another heart coming my way

25:18.543 --> 25:19.909
before I die.

25:22.693 --> 25:24.578
You know why I hate those?

25:26.154 --> 25:27.858
I see a lot of reasons.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.130
They remind me that I'm alone.

25:32.612 --> 25:35.115
So now, here I am in my...

25:35.417 --> 25:36.802
little room,

25:36.838 --> 25:39.162
where the only person
who comes to visit...

25:39.407 --> 25:41.404
is just doing her job.

25:49.487 --> 25:50.836
Go.

26:03.554 --> 26:05.130
Well, the press are on their way in.

26:06.104 --> 26:07.838
But I want you to think carefully

26:07.873 --> 26:09.269
before you make all this noise.

26:09.906 --> 26:11.232
What about my offer?

26:13.186 --> 26:14.211
Come in.

26:20.119 --> 26:22.252
The responsibility is mine.

26:28.760 --> 26:31.428
Doug's responding well
to the atropine and 2-PAM.

26:31.463 --> 26:32.863
I'm still waiting for send-out labs.

26:32.898 --> 26:34.865
Just give me a little bit more time

26:34.900 --> 26:37.401
before I have to give you a
definitive answer on everything.

26:39.241 --> 26:40.604
Do you know...

26:40.832 --> 26:43.032
I only ever had one job...

26:43.068 --> 26:45.068
before I became a doctor?

26:48.476 --> 26:51.782
I worked the register
at my family's hardware store

26:51.817 --> 26:53.097
since I was a kid.

26:55.281 --> 26:59.886
And I would watch customers
walk in and out all day.

27:01.179 --> 27:02.917
They came to see my father...

27:04.907 --> 27:06.463
because they knew
he wouldn't overcharge them

27:06.498 --> 27:08.898
or try and sell them
something they didn't need.

27:12.304 --> 27:14.105
They knew he was a good man...

27:16.386 --> 27:18.166
worthy of their trust.

27:19.513 --> 27:20.744
I worked so hard

27:20.779 --> 27:23.059
all my life to be seen like my dad.

27:26.302 --> 27:28.520
But I didn't do enough to be like him.

27:33.438 --> 27:34.762
Thank you for trying.

27:44.570 --> 27:45.869
Elijah stacks cups.

27:45.904 --> 27:48.005
I mean, it's not really a talent,

27:48.040 --> 27:50.340
but they let him do it.

27:53.621 --> 27:56.483
- What's that noise mean?
- Uh, that's your heart rate.

27:56.519 --> 27:58.215
We just don't want it to get too high.

27:58.493 --> 28:01.652
She just hit the 150s, and her
temperature is rapidly rising.

28:01.687 --> 28:03.053
Cooled fluids and IV acetaminophen.

28:03.088 --> 28:04.555
Started that ten minutes ago.

28:04.590 --> 28:05.689
She's not responding.

28:05.724 --> 28:08.058
I think this might be
malignant hyperthermia.

28:08.750 --> 28:11.449
- I'm really hot.
- Get the dantrolene.

28:12.053 --> 28:13.820
- What's that mean?
- It's just special meds

28:13.856 --> 28:15.103
for this kind of situation.

28:16.797 --> 28:18.168
Hey, Lucy, why don't you sing that song

28:18.203 --> 28:19.836
you sang for your talent show.

28:19.871 --> 28:21.371
- Now?
- Yeah.

28:21.406 --> 28:23.373
Yeah, just pretend like no one's here.

28:23.408 --> 28:25.842
Just... close your eyes and sing.

28:26.280 --> 28:27.843
- Okay.

29:28.407 --> 29:30.040
If we don't slow down her metabolism,

29:30.075 --> 29:31.141
we risk her life.

You have a beautiful voice.

30:34.016 --> 30:35.649
Yes, Lucy, can you sing us

Aaron.

31:10.675 --> 31:12.476
The surgery went smoothly.

31:12.613 --> 31:14.563
Your new heart is functioning well.

31:18.150 --> 31:19.964
The nurse stopped the propofol
an hour ago.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.084
He should be awake by now.

31:21.383 --> 31:23.027
Can you open your eyes for us, bud?

31:29.242 --> 31:30.327
Blown pupil.

31:30.362 --> 31:32.496
Pressure's a little high.
He's relatively bradycardic.

31:32.531 --> 31:33.530
Explains hypertension.

31:33.565 --> 31:35.265
- Cushing's reflex.
- He's having a stroke.

31:35.300 --> 31:36.700
We need 50 grams of IV mannitol!

31:36.735 --> 31:39.235
And to get him to CT.
Somebody page Dr. Austin now!

31:45.572 --> 31:49.279
- Stroke?
- Cardiopulmonary bypass,

31:49.315 --> 31:51.662
blood thinners...
it all put Aaron at risk.

31:51.697 --> 31:52.996
Well, is he okay?

31:53.462 --> 31:54.492
No.

31:54.809 --> 31:56.100
He's brain-dead.

31:56.922 --> 31:58.802
Stroke is a known complication

31:58.837 --> 32:00.140
of the transplant process.

32:00.176 --> 32:01.509
Aaron was unlucky.

32:01.545 --> 32:04.513
We did everything we could,
but the injury was catastrophic.

32:08.103 --> 32:09.534
Sitting in this room...

32:11.154 --> 32:13.466
wondering if each day will be your last,

32:14.450 --> 32:16.353
it's hard in ways that you...

32:16.826 --> 32:18.060
you can't understand

32:18.795 --> 32:20.222
unless you've lived it.

32:21.846 --> 32:22.995
Like we did.

32:25.188 --> 32:26.538
Poor kid.

32:27.256 --> 32:28.980
Stuck in here with me.

32:29.434 --> 32:31.067
I could have gone easier on him,

32:31.102 --> 32:33.970
and... instead,
I made his last days harder

32:34.005 --> 32:35.097
than they needed to be.

32:35.566 --> 32:38.290
We think there's something
you should know about Aaron.

32:40.550 --> 32:42.275
He loved being your roommate.

32:43.454 --> 32:44.433
What?

32:44.469 --> 32:46.783
Yeah. When we tried to separate you two,

32:46.818 --> 32:48.665
he begged us not to.

32:49.197 --> 32:50.630
He said he would die from boredom

32:50.666 --> 32:52.180
without you on the other side
of the curtain.

32:52.216 --> 32:53.816
I think in a weird way

32:53.852 --> 32:56.576
driving you crazy kept him sane.

32:56.657 --> 32:59.825
You're not just saying that
to make me feel better?

32:59.861 --> 33:02.014
Aaron was also an organ donor.

33:05.627 --> 33:07.294
I-I get the heart?

33:08.425 --> 33:09.812
You can do that?

33:11.773 --> 33:14.511
Reuse of a transplanted heart

33:14.546 --> 33:15.799
is complicated.

33:17.092 --> 33:19.482
This will be the heart's third home

33:19.517 --> 33:20.714
in the last 24 hours.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.478
Every time a heart is transplanted,

33:23.539 --> 33:25.484
reperfusion injury occurs.

33:26.858 --> 33:28.343
Increasing the chance

33:28.379 --> 33:31.236
that your transplant course
could be a rocky one,

33:31.996 --> 33:35.909
but we will do everything
we can to minimize those risks.

33:54.771 --> 33:56.267
Make yourselves comfortable.

33:56.303 --> 33:58.013
Dr. Bell will be in shortly.

34:06.682 --> 34:07.725
Hey.

34:08.199 --> 34:09.565
There are no more tests to run.

34:09.601 --> 34:11.362
It's time to send Cynthia and Raj home,

34:11.853 --> 34:14.722
which means... discharge papers.

34:14.757 --> 34:17.176
Why did Doug get worse
and not the others?

34:18.342 --> 34:20.492
I still think we're missing something.

34:20.599 --> 34:22.458
Uncertainty is part of the job.

34:23.181 --> 34:24.600
I won't tell you who taught me that,

34:24.636 --> 34:25.882
but he seems to have forgotten.

34:27.581 --> 34:28.982
You guys really need to do better

34:29.018 --> 34:30.217
with those hospital gowns.

34:30.254 --> 34:31.553
Can't wait to get out of here,

34:31.589 --> 34:32.722
get back to the gym.

34:34.121 --> 34:35.321
That's a pretty dress.

34:35.460 --> 34:37.304
They were getting ready to leave.

34:38.869 --> 34:39.920
Okay.

34:39.956 --> 34:42.024
- Keep going.
- Doug and the man

34:42.060 --> 34:43.193
at Atlanta General,

34:43.228 --> 34:44.870
they both got worse.

34:45.803 --> 34:48.838
And they were getting ready to go home.

34:48.873 --> 34:49.871
Wait a minute.

34:53.150 --> 34:54.610
Get back in your rooms.

35:03.988 --> 35:06.456
Doug, glad you're feeling better.

35:06.491 --> 35:08.104
We need to examine your skin.

35:08.313 --> 35:09.386
I'll start at the top.

35:09.422 --> 35:10.804
I'll work my way up.

35:13.486 --> 35:14.740
Thank you for coming.

35:22.088 --> 35:23.554
I thought we already examined him.

35:23.665 --> 35:25.098
That was before he coded.

35:25.134 --> 35:26.672
What exactly are we looking for?

35:27.752 --> 35:28.921
That.

35:31.798 --> 35:33.705
A subtle maculopapular rash.

35:34.319 --> 35:35.718
That doesn't sound good.

35:35.753 --> 35:38.199
I need to see the clothes you wore
when you came into Chastain.

35:38.235 --> 35:39.234
On the couch.

35:44.569 --> 35:45.743
Bingo.

35:45.779 --> 35:47.270
Where'd you get these?

35:49.601 --> 35:51.177
We've prepared a statement.

35:56.841 --> 35:58.874
It wasn't 3B Life.

35:59.562 --> 36:00.952
Uh, let's take five.

36:04.048 --> 36:06.104
Initially, we focused
on what the patients ate,

36:06.140 --> 36:08.241
but it wasn't consumption
that made them sick.

36:08.620 --> 36:10.353
- It was absorption.
- Absorption...?

36:10.388 --> 36:11.977
- From what?
- Their clothes.

36:12.724 --> 36:14.997
All three shopped at the same
boutique clothing store.

36:15.033 --> 36:16.258
- Jacket.
- When clothes are shipped

36:16.294 --> 36:17.994
in a truck with chemicals,

36:18.029 --> 36:19.754
one spill of a pesticide

36:19.790 --> 36:22.012
can contaminate the entire delivery

36:22.300 --> 36:23.674
without anyone realizing.

36:24.369 --> 36:25.868
It's happened before.

36:25.903 --> 36:27.652
But they were all on 3B Life.

36:27.688 --> 36:29.509
All three patients,
on their questionnaires,

36:29.545 --> 36:30.844
stated that they ordered
your supplements

36:30.880 --> 36:32.013
from the shopping network

36:32.049 --> 36:33.516
after your appearance.

36:33.552 --> 36:37.087
They also said
that same shopping network

36:37.123 --> 36:41.892
ran ads for this boutique
clothing store constantly.

36:43.123 --> 36:45.990
So these caused
the organophosphate poisoning,

36:46.749 --> 36:48.742
not 3B Life.

36:49.400 --> 36:50.476
You're off the hook.

36:51.138 --> 36:52.604
Oh, my God.

36:53.246 --> 36:54.879
Oh, my God, it wasn't us. I-I knew it.

36:54.915 --> 36:55.872
I told you. I...

36:55.908 --> 36:57.204
I knew it.

36:59.721 --> 37:01.332
We won't be needing these anymore.

37:16.163 --> 37:17.397
Dr. Pierce.

37:17.432 --> 37:18.893
Hi, Dr. Bell.

37:20.630 --> 37:22.502
You think dealing with patients
can be a pain,

37:22.537 --> 37:24.170
try dealing with a TV producer.

37:24.205 --> 37:25.837
Mm.

37:27.142 --> 37:29.008
You left in a hurry this morning.

37:29.043 --> 37:30.289
It was a hell of a day.

37:31.242 --> 37:32.706
Your coat's over there.

37:33.569 --> 37:34.856
Appreciate the call.

37:35.419 --> 37:37.850
I could've had it sent over,
but I wanted to...

37:37.885 --> 37:39.852
talk to you face-to-face.

37:39.887 --> 37:42.522
You know, most doctors come on my show

37:42.557 --> 37:44.557
and they just talk product,

37:44.592 --> 37:45.799
but not you.

37:46.300 --> 37:47.961
I liked what you had to say,

37:47.996 --> 37:49.562
and my audience loved you.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.763
Well... thank you.

37:52.409 --> 37:54.133
Well, not a lot of people know this.

37:54.374 --> 37:55.768
I'm gonna retire.

37:55.961 --> 37:58.604
And I'd like to float your name
to the network

37:58.639 --> 38:00.239
for a possible trial run.

38:00.274 --> 38:01.908
Do a couple of guest spots,

38:01.943 --> 38:03.076
see how it goes.

38:03.111 --> 38:04.143
You interested?

38:04.547 --> 38:06.479
My commitments at Chastain
are full-time,

38:06.514 --> 38:09.500
and, uh, I'm very happy in the OR.

38:09.536 --> 38:12.251
But why reach one person at a
time for the rest of your career

38:12.286 --> 38:14.181
when you can reach millions with that?

38:14.939 --> 38:17.026
From what I saw, you know how to use it.

38:18.039 --> 38:21.227
You know, I-I know a dozen doctors

38:21.262 --> 38:23.129
who would kill for this opportunity.

38:23.164 --> 38:24.210
Uh...

38:24.912 --> 38:26.099
why me?

38:26.496 --> 38:29.102
My producer keeps bringing in these kids

38:29.137 --> 38:30.436
right out of med school.

38:30.471 --> 38:31.671
Great smiles,

38:31.706 --> 38:33.673
no experience.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.787
An audience can smell bull.

38:35.823 --> 38:37.944
What they want
is someone they can trust.

38:37.979 --> 38:40.022
Someone like you.

38:40.745 --> 38:43.116
To pitch softball stories
about antioxidants?

38:43.319 --> 38:45.518
One day, coffee can prevent cancer.

38:45.553 --> 38:47.425
The next day... it can kill you.

38:49.788 --> 38:51.024
It's entertainment.

38:51.059 --> 38:52.425
Well, you're not wrong.

38:52.460 --> 38:54.890
So, if you don't like the way
it's done, change it.

38:56.922 --> 38:58.798
My producer's gonna call you.

38:58.833 --> 39:00.391
Think about it.

39:01.389 --> 39:02.733
Thanks, guys!

39:19.320 --> 39:21.287
And we're back in five,

39:21.322 --> 39:22.929
four, three...

39:26.315 --> 39:28.806
Professor, how you feeling?

39:29.956 --> 39:32.231
- Grateful.
- Your new heart is performing well.

39:32.320 --> 39:34.439
At this rate, you could be out
of the hospital in a week.

39:35.538 --> 39:37.203
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

39:40.842 --> 39:42.708
We were able to reach
one of Aaron's relatives

39:42.743 --> 39:44.310
from out of town.

39:44.345 --> 39:46.512
She'll be in tomorrow
to pick up his things.

39:47.548 --> 39:48.693
Tell her...

39:49.270 --> 39:50.917
I'd like to buy those.

39:50.952 --> 39:52.185
You hate them.

39:52.220 --> 39:53.313
I do.

39:54.314 --> 39:57.297
But they remind me
of what I don't want to be.

39:58.486 --> 40:00.593
I think they'll help me make a change.

40:00.707 --> 40:03.632
Well, Aaron was an artist after all.

40:04.115 --> 40:05.115
Yes.

40:06.161 --> 40:07.200
Yes, he was.

40:08.174 --> 40:09.335
Before we go,

40:09.370 --> 40:11.070
we have to wedge the PA catheter.

40:11.446 --> 40:12.511
You know what?

40:13.194 --> 40:16.409
Why don't you two round
on the rest of our service?

40:16.464 --> 40:17.955
I'll finish up here.

40:40.457 --> 40:41.534
How is she?

40:41.958 --> 40:43.536
Well, she woke up for a minute

40:43.571 --> 40:45.304
but then fell asleep mid-sentence.

40:45.339 --> 40:47.306
Well, that's perfectly normal.

40:47.341 --> 40:48.899
Her recovery will take some time.

40:49.877 --> 40:52.145
However long it takes, I'm here for her.

40:54.649 --> 40:57.650
Please, thank Dr. Cain for us.

41:00.138 --> 41:01.264
Of course.

41:10.808 --> 41:11.964
She nearly died.

41:11.999 --> 41:12.965
But she didn't.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.027
Because we got lucky.

41:14.063 --> 41:15.902
Don't believe in luck,
just talent and fate.

41:15.937 --> 41:17.470
Caution isn't weakness.

41:17.505 --> 41:18.737
Risk is part of the job.

41:18.773 --> 41:20.907
So you risk a little girl's life? Why?

41:21.052 --> 41:22.175
To impress some donors?

41:22.210 --> 41:23.975
Again, nobody died.

41:24.011 --> 41:27.180
Even when we do everything we
can to prepare, things go wrong.

41:27.215 --> 41:29.172
What chance do our patients have
if we don't?

41:29.875 --> 41:31.259
They deserve better.

41:32.620 --> 41:35.531
There's a reason they don't name
buildings after nurses.

41:49.804 --> 41:50.770
Midtown.

41:50.805 --> 41:52.004
Overpriced.

41:52.039 --> 41:53.773
- Doll's Head Trail.
- Overrated.

41:53.808 --> 41:55.975
- Botanical Garden?
- Boring.

41:56.010 --> 41:57.476
Okay, come on. There's got to be

41:57.511 --> 41:58.711
at least one place on my list

41:58.746 --> 41:59.979
that I should check out in Atlanta.

42:00.014 --> 42:01.147
If you want a good time,

42:01.182 --> 42:02.333
you want to go to Inman Park.

42:02.829 --> 42:04.350
I will check that out.

42:04.385 --> 42:05.677
We could check it out together.

42:07.936 --> 42:09.023
Tomorrow night.

42:09.059 --> 42:10.289
You drive.

42:10.464 --> 42:11.733
No open-toed shoes.

43:19.689 --> 43:23.689
