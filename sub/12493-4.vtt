WEBVTT

00:05.955 --> 00:08.122
- Hey!
- There you are.

00:08.122 --> 00:10.592
So what's the big news and
why didn't you just text me?

00:10.592 --> 00:12.593
Because I wanted to see
the expression on your face

00:12.593 --> 00:15.096
When I told you--
okay, here goes:

00:15.096 --> 00:17.499
So that really
hot senior josh

00:17.499 --> 00:20.134
Invited me to his party
this weekend.

00:21.404 --> 00:23.271
And he said I could
bring a friend.

00:25.373 --> 00:28.109
So tell me how it all
went down.

00:28.109 --> 00:29.811
Okay okay okay.

00:29.811 --> 00:33.447
So I was standing at my locker
when josh asked me.

00:33.447 --> 00:35.516
I got so nervous I closed
my hair in the door

00:35.516 --> 00:38.185
And I had to stand there
like this.

00:38.185 --> 00:40.654
Wait a minute.

00:40.654 --> 00:42.823
Our moms will never let us
go to a senior party.

00:42.823 --> 00:47.028
- Already solved that.
- Ooh, we're gonna lie.

00:47.028 --> 00:49.897
- We can't. You're a terrible liar.
- I am not.

00:49.897 --> 00:52.699
Yeah you are. Whenever you lie,
your voice gets really high.

00:52.699 --> 00:54.836
huh-uh!

00:54.836 --> 00:57.037
Okay, so here's the plan.

00:57.037 --> 00:59.573
You know that app that lets you
create fake phone calls?

00:59.573 --> 01:01.508
That what
that creates what?

01:01.508 --> 01:04.845
There's a phone app that you can
create fake phone calls with.

01:04.845 --> 01:07.048
All I have to do is record
my mom saying some stuff

01:07.048 --> 01:09.551
That sounds like she's giving
me permission to go to the party.

01:09.551 --> 01:12.053
Ah, then when my mom hears it

01:12.053 --> 01:13.755
- She'll let me go.
- Exactly.

01:13.755 --> 01:16.391
And we go to the party and josh
falls in love with me.

01:16.391 --> 01:19.527
Oh, and his cute best friend
falls in love with me,

01:19.527 --> 01:21.729
But I tell him that
I have a boyfriend,

01:21.729 --> 01:23.698
But he doesn't take no
for an answer--

01:23.698 --> 01:26.234
- Are you done?
- And then

01:26.234 --> 01:28.536
There's a third guy
that gets interested...

01:30.939 --> 01:32.707
<i>¶ today's all burnt toast ¶</i>

01:32.707 --> 01:34.375
<i>¶ running late,
and dad says ¶</i>

01:34.375 --> 01:37.211
<i>¶ has anybody
seen my left shoe? ¶</i>

01:37.211 --> 01:38.979
<i>¶ I close my eyes,
take a bite ¶</i>

01:38.979 --> 01:40.648
<i>¶ grab a ride,
laugh out loud ¶</i>

01:40.648 --> 01:43.451
<i>¶ there it is
up on the roof ¶</i>

01:43.451 --> 01:47.088
<i>¶ I've been there,
I've survived ¶</i>

01:47.088 --> 01:50.357
<i>¶ so just take
my advice ¶</i>

01:50.357 --> 01:52.494
<i>¶ hang in there, baby ¶</i>

01:52.494 --> 01:54.262
<i>¶ things are crazy ¶</i>

01:54.262 --> 01:56.865
<i>¶ but I know
your future's bright ¶</i>

01:56.865 --> 01:58.766
<i>¶ hang in there, baby ¶</i>

01:58.766 --> 02:00.601
<i>¶ there's no maybe ¶</i>

02:00.601 --> 02:03.371
<i>¶ everything
turns out all right ¶</i>

02:03.371 --> 02:05.807

02:05.807 --> 02:09.176

02:27.329 --> 02:30.397
Oh, charlie.

02:30.397 --> 02:33.000
You know daddy loves you,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.636
But daddy's played baby
about 100 times

02:35.636 --> 02:38.806
And he doesn't feel so good.
He needs to rest.

02:41.110 --> 02:43.677
Oh, okay.
All right.

02:43.677 --> 02:46.514
Oh, I know!
Let's play

02:46.514 --> 02:48.616
Baby watches daddy
take a nap.

02:51.719 --> 02:53.921
Aha!
Boys, I need your help.

02:53.921 --> 02:57.192
- Really?
- Today at work I got bit by a spider.

02:57.192 --> 02:59.927
You're an exterminator.
Doesn't that happen every day?

02:59.927 --> 03:04.064
Well, this particular spider I
happen to be mildly allergic to.

03:04.064 --> 03:07.601
- that's disgusting!

03:07.601 --> 03:10.104
<i>Gabe: Cover it, cover it, cover
it. Please, I think I'm gonna barf.</i>

03:10.104 --> 03:13.641
Thank you so much
for your concern.

03:13.641 --> 03:15.443
I went
and I saw the doctor.

03:15.443 --> 03:17.812
She says the swelling's going
to be gone in a couple of days.

03:17.812 --> 03:20.415
Oh, that's revolting.

03:20.415 --> 03:23.117
Although it does make
your tummy look smaller.

03:23.117 --> 03:27.121
"gosh, dad, how could I
help?" thanks for asking.

03:27.121 --> 03:29.424
P.J., I need you to cover
for me at work tomorrow.

03:29.424 --> 03:31.124
<i>- I got a really busy day.</i>

03:31.124 --> 03:33.594
fine, I'll help.

03:33.594 --> 03:37.231
But I better not get a giant arm
too. I just bought some shirts.

03:40.569 --> 03:42.170
Gabe, I gotta go
upstairs and rest,

03:42.170 --> 03:43.838
So I need you to look after
charlie, okay?

03:43.838 --> 03:45.772
What am I supposed to do
with charlie?

03:45.772 --> 03:49.010
Wha-- you play baby
with her.

03:49.010 --> 03:51.412
Come on, she loves it.

04:00.873 --> 04:01.593
Fetch.

04:17.505 --> 04:21.409
Okay, ivy, I'm about to launch
phase one of operation fool mom.

04:21.409 --> 04:23.378
What?  No.
I don't know what

04:23.378 --> 04:26.414
I'm gonna wear to the party.
Let's trick our moms first.

04:30.385 --> 04:32.654
- Hi mom.
- Hey.

04:32.654 --> 04:36.089
What? Mom, I haven't seen you
all day and all I get is a hey?

04:36.089 --> 04:38.892
Sorry.
Hi, teddy!

04:38.892 --> 04:42.863
Uh, mom, could you get this
loose thread on my sweater?

04:42.863 --> 04:47.467
- Where is it?
- Oh, must have fallen off.

04:47.467 --> 04:49.770
Threads.

04:49.770 --> 04:51.772
Go figure.

04:54.207 --> 04:55.476
How are you doing?

04:57.712 --> 04:59.914
Fine.
Oh, mom,

04:59.914 --> 05:01.683
Could I ask you
a personal question?

05:01.683 --> 05:03.918
Honey, of course you can.

05:03.918 --> 05:04.638
Great.

05:07.955 --> 05:10.491
What's-- what's--
what's the question?

05:10.491 --> 05:13.895
Oh, I don't have one
right now.

05:13.895 --> 05:14.735
Just...

05:16.498 --> 05:19.666
You know, good to know
for down the road.

05:22.270 --> 05:24.639
Seriously,
how are you doing?

05:24.639 --> 05:27.974
Oh, mom, you took spanish,
right? What does this mean?

05:31.779 --> 05:34.015
That means I like that
boy. He's very nice.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.217
Wait a minute, I thought
you were taking french.

05:37.217 --> 05:39.553
Oh, wow.

05:39.553 --> 05:42.255
Guess that's why
I didn't understand it.

05:44.392 --> 05:46.960
- I love you, mom.
- I love you too, honey.

05:49.630 --> 05:52.532
Weird-- I usually have
those conversations with p.J.

06:39.347 --> 06:42.116
dad, make it stop.

06:42.116 --> 06:45.419
- Make what stop?
- Play baby.

06:45.419 --> 06:48.156
- That.

06:48.156 --> 06:51.192
Everywhere I go there
she is: "play baby,

06:51.192 --> 06:52.926
Play baby,
play baby."

06:54.496 --> 06:57.765
I'm sorry, son, but somebody
has finally found you likeable.

07:00.135 --> 07:02.503
Well, I can't take it
anymore.

07:02.503 --> 07:04.337
I'm going to the library.

07:04.337 --> 07:06.707
- The library?
- Yeah, dad.

07:06.707 --> 07:08.543
It's come to that.

07:08.543 --> 07:11.678
- Do you even know where the library is?
- I'll find it.

07:16.118 --> 07:17.851
<i>- she's coming!</i>

07:17.851 --> 07:19.387
Okay, are you ready
with your phone?

07:19.387 --> 07:20.621
Ready.

07:20.621 --> 07:24.459
- Oh, hi, mrs. Wentz.
- Hi, teddy.

07:24.459 --> 07:27.395
- Ivy, didn't you hear me?
- No.

07:27.395 --> 07:32.265
I have been honking and
screaming "ivy" for 10 minutes.

07:32.265 --> 07:34.969
That was you?

07:34.969 --> 07:37.270
I know so many people.

07:37.270 --> 07:41.409
- Let's go.
- Before that, quick question.

07:41.409 --> 07:43.911
- What?
- There's a senior boy named josh

07:43.911 --> 07:46.647
And he invited teddy and me to
a party this weekend. Can I go?

07:46.647 --> 07:49.349
Now, ivy,
you know my policy.

07:49.349 --> 07:51.919
Unless I've met the boy,
the answer's no.

07:51.919 --> 07:54.722
And I'm sure teddy's mom
said the same thing.

07:54.722 --> 07:57.058
Oh well, actually I haven't
asked my mom yet.

07:57.058 --> 08:00.661
Oh hey, why don't I call my mom
at work and see what she says?

08:02.731 --> 08:04.899
- it's ringing.

08:04.899 --> 08:09.003
<i>- Hi, mom.
- Hi, teddy.</i>

08:09.003 --> 08:13.440
Uh, mom, I was calling to see
if I can go to a party?

08:13.440 --> 08:15.976
<i
>- Where is it? - It's at my friend josh's house.

08:15.976 --> 08:18.079
You know josh, right?

08:18.079 --> 08:19.947
<i>I like that boy.
He's very nice.</i>

08:23.284 --> 08:25.753
So what do you say?
Can I go to the party?

08:25.753 --> 08:28.556
<i>Honey, of course you can.</i>

08:30.625 --> 08:32.491
Thanks, mom.
You're the best.

08:32.491 --> 08:34.794
All right, I don't want
to keep you. Love you!

08:34.794 --> 08:36.296
<i>Love you too, honey.</i>

08:41.202 --> 08:42.202
See?

08:43.871 --> 08:46.640
Teddy gets to go.

08:46.640 --> 08:50.076
Well, if it's okay
with amy.

08:50.076 --> 08:51.678
- it's okay with me. You can go.

08:53.313 --> 08:55.215
Thanks, mom.
You're the best.

08:55.215 --> 08:58.618
<i>I like that boy.
He's very nice.</i>

08:58.618 --> 09:00.220
What was that?

09:00.220 --> 09:02.722
Oh, I was just doing
an impression of my mom.

09:02.722 --> 09:05.692
I also do my dad.

09:05.692 --> 09:07.662
"teddy, get in here!"

09:09.230 --> 09:10.997
What is it, dad?

09:10.997 --> 09:13.199
"who ate the last donut?"

09:13.199 --> 09:15.835
You did, dad.

09:15.835 --> 09:19.039
well,
we'd better get going.

09:27.348 --> 09:29.683
Mmm, what smells so good?

09:29.683 --> 09:32.452
- Hot dogs.
- Oh.

09:32.452 --> 09:35.622
Nothing makes
boiled water smell better

09:35.622 --> 09:37.724
Than amy duncan's
hot dogs.

09:39.794 --> 09:41.227
This should be good.

09:41.227 --> 09:43.430
Um, so, mom,

09:43.430 --> 09:46.032
I was wondering if I could go
to a party at josh's house.

09:46.032 --> 09:48.368
He's this really cute senior.
You don't know him.

09:48.368 --> 09:51.338
I'm sorry, teddy, the answer's
no. You know my policy.

09:51.338 --> 09:53.640
Oh, come on! Ivy's
mom is letting her go.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.343
- Mary lou wentz gave permission?
- Yes.

09:56.343 --> 09:59.045
Yes, she did. And I can call her
if you want to hear from her.

10:00.915 --> 10:02.716
I'd love to.

10:04.018 --> 10:05.819
Hi, mrs. Wentz,
it's teddy duncan.

10:05.819 --> 10:08.588
I'm gonna put you
on speaker, okay?

10:08.588 --> 10:12.993
So, mrs. Wentz, you're letting
ivy go to that party, right?

10:12.993 --> 10:14.394
<i>It's okay with me.</i>

10:16.497 --> 10:19.399
<i
>- Are you sure, mary lou, because-- - it's okay with me.

10:21.502 --> 10:24.004
<i
>- Really, you're not the least bit-- - it's okay with me.

10:25.006 --> 10:27.073
Oops, lost her.

10:27.073 --> 10:29.075
So can I go to the party?

10:30.244 --> 10:32.278
Well...

10:32.278 --> 10:34.581
If it's okay with mary lou,
it's okay with me.

10:34.581 --> 10:37.384
Ooh, thank you, mommy!
Love you so much.

10:37.384 --> 10:41.588
Yeah... No one loves mom more
than when she's saying yes.

10:45.526 --> 10:47.494
That was an interesting
phone call.

10:49.163 --> 10:50.830
Was it?

10:50.830 --> 10:52.932
Yeah.

10:52.932 --> 10:55.001
Yeah, it was.

11:14.372 --> 11:16.873
Having fun yet, kid?

11:16.873 --> 11:19.009
No, vern, I am not.

11:19.009 --> 11:21.211
First time
in a crawl space?

11:21.211 --> 11:24.214
I can't believe my dad
does this for a living.

11:24.214 --> 11:27.684
I'm really gonna have to start
paying attention in school.

11:27.684 --> 11:29.186
<i>- Shh!</i>

11:29.186 --> 11:31.455
Uh-oh, rats.

11:31.455 --> 11:33.190
Rats?

11:33.190 --> 11:35.859
I thought we were
catching possums.

11:35.859 --> 11:38.695
Sometimes the critters
make the decisions.

11:40.765 --> 11:43.400
- Where are the rats?
- All around us.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.635
<i>- dozens.</i>

11:45.635 --> 11:48.205
Maybe hundreds.

11:50.273 --> 11:53.376
Quiet.
If they smell fear,

11:53.376 --> 11:54.811
We're both dead.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.321
That was horrifying.

12:05.890 --> 12:07.791
Pass the salt, kid.

12:09.994 --> 12:12.662
Uh, that's termite poison.

12:12.662 --> 12:15.599
You only put that
on a sandwich once.

12:15.599 --> 12:17.501
Whoops.
Sorry.

12:19.237 --> 12:22.472
Well, it's nice
to finally meet you.

12:22.472 --> 12:24.441
Your dad sure talks
about you a lot.

12:24.441 --> 12:26.743
- He does?
- All the time.

12:26.743 --> 12:29.546
Goes on and on about you--
how you're smart,

12:29.546 --> 12:31.148
Driven, popular.

12:31.148 --> 12:34.184
- He said all that about me?
- Oh yeah.

12:34.184 --> 12:36.286
He's very proud.

12:38.089 --> 12:40.223
Well, lunch break's
over, ted.

12:41.225 --> 12:43.026
Ted?
Ted?!

12:43.026 --> 12:45.428
Oh, teddy's my sister.

12:45.428 --> 12:48.365
Oh, then you must
be the self-confident

12:48.365 --> 12:50.267
Sharp-as-a-tack
mischief-maker.

12:50.267 --> 12:52.903
That's gabe.

12:52.903 --> 12:53.903
Hmm.

12:54.839 --> 12:58.608
You're the little cutie pie
who just got out of diapers?

12:59.610 --> 13:02.145
I'm the oldest!

13:02.145 --> 13:04.414
- P.J.?
- Oh right, of course.

13:04.414 --> 13:06.016
P.J.--
You're the nice one.

13:06.016 --> 13:08.485
That's it?

13:08.485 --> 13:11.621
Everyone else is sharp,

13:11.621 --> 13:13.023
Smart and adorable

13:13.023 --> 13:15.692
And I'm just nice?

13:16.928 --> 13:19.863
I know what'll turn
that frown upside down.

13:22.133 --> 13:24.234
You get to carry
the rat bag.

13:32.944 --> 13:35.312
- Hi, amy.
- Hi, mary lou! Come on in.

13:35.312 --> 13:37.948
- Okay.
- What brings you here?

13:37.948 --> 13:39.449
Ivy forgot her boa.

13:39.449 --> 13:42.586
Now if she's going to a
party, she needs her boa.

13:44.121 --> 13:46.122
They just left,
but don't worry--

13:46.122 --> 13:48.959
The leopard-print dress
will be festive enough.

13:48.959 --> 13:51.628
I gotta say, amy,
I was a bit surprised

13:51.628 --> 13:54.164
You gave teddy permission
to go to that party.

13:54.164 --> 13:58.201
Well, I only said yes to teddy
because you gave ivy permission first.

13:58.201 --> 14:00.904
You know how much I respect
you as a mother. Cracker?

14:00.904 --> 14:03.106
Oh, thank you.

14:03.106 --> 14:06.509
But you gave teddy
permission first

14:06.509 --> 14:08.845
And I said yes because
of how much I respect you.

14:08.845 --> 14:10.814
Okay, yeah yeah yeah,
best moms ever.

14:10.814 --> 14:14.384
I'm trying to watch
my cartoons here.

14:14.384 --> 14:17.320
I-- I didn't give
teddy permission first.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.055
But I heard teddy
call you at work.

14:19.055 --> 14:21.892
No, teddy never called
me at work. I'm confused.

14:21.892 --> 14:25.028
- Yeah, me too.
- May I enlighten you?

14:27.398 --> 14:30.367
- Spill it.
- The girls used a phone app to make it sound like

14:30.367 --> 14:32.369
You each gave them permission
to go to the party.

14:32.369 --> 14:33.937
- What?
- They didn't!

14:33.937 --> 14:37.741
Oh, mary lou, but they did.

14:39.610 --> 14:42.078
Now, mom,
so next time I'm bad--

14:42.078 --> 14:45.782
we both know
there will be a next time--

14:45.782 --> 14:48.652
Just remember this moment
when I did something for you.

14:50.054 --> 14:52.555
They are gonna be in so much
trouble when they get home.

14:52.555 --> 14:56.092
Why wait till they get home? They're
not the only ones who know about apps.

14:56.092 --> 14:57.761
No, they aren't.

14:57.761 --> 15:00.063
What do we know about apps?

15:01.565 --> 15:04.434
I have a g.P.S. App
on this phone.

15:04.434 --> 15:07.804
That means I can track
ivy's phone.

15:07.804 --> 15:10.840
Shall we go to a party?

15:10.840 --> 15:12.776
I'd be "appy" to.

15:22.420 --> 15:24.821
- hello?

15:24.821 --> 15:27.290
Teddy dear, gabe here.

15:27.290 --> 15:31.728
Before I share the news, let's remember
this moment the next time I need a favor.

15:31.728 --> 15:35.699
Why do all of your calls start
with the same creepy question?

15:37.635 --> 15:40.603
Mom and mrs. Wentz know all
about the phony phone calls.

15:40.603 --> 15:42.939
What?!
How'd they find out?

15:42.939 --> 15:46.676
That part remains a mystery.
Anywho...

15:46.676 --> 15:49.346
They're tracking you on g.P.S.
And heading your way.

15:49.346 --> 15:51.915
What?  Our moms are
tracking us on g.P.S.

15:51.915 --> 15:54.884
G.P.S.? They're not
supposed to know about that.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.455
Oh gosh, thanks, gabe.
I owe you one.

15:58.455 --> 16:01.424
So it would seem.

16:14.739 --> 16:18.641
There you are. I think charlie
wants to play baby with you.

16:18.641 --> 16:21.277
She keeps going,
"gabe, gabe!"

16:21.277 --> 16:24.247
She can say it all she wants.
It's not gonna happen.

16:24.247 --> 16:27.283
I'm sick of her and I'm sick
of that stupid doll.

16:32.957 --> 16:35.825
Oh, charlie, come on!
I didn't mean it.

16:35.825 --> 16:37.260
I was just gabe
being gabe.

16:41.098 --> 16:44.567
Hey, there he is!
How'd it go today?

16:44.567 --> 16:46.503
the highlight of my day

16:46.503 --> 16:48.938
Was carrying a bag of rats.

16:51.342 --> 16:55.011
Vern must like you because he's
awful particular about his rat bag.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.049
Vern told me what you said
about us kids.

16:59.049 --> 17:01.718
- What'd I say?
- That everyone else is so great

17:01.718 --> 17:04.054
And I'm just nice.

17:04.054 --> 17:04.804
So?

17:06.390 --> 17:08.191
You're nice,
what's wrong with that?

17:08.191 --> 17:10.326
So "nice" is what your friend
calls the ugly girl

17:10.326 --> 17:12.429
He wants you
to go out with.

17:12.429 --> 17:14.097
Is that all
I am to you--

17:14.097 --> 17:16.031
An ugly girl?

17:23.607 --> 17:25.909
Oh, this is so exciting--

17:25.909 --> 17:28.111
Going after the perps.

17:30.047 --> 17:32.248
Wait, the girls
are turning around.

17:32.248 --> 17:35.251
- What?
- Looks like they're headed back to your house.

17:37.054 --> 17:39.522
Hold on your your purse,
mary lou. We're making a u-ey.

17:43.294 --> 17:45.195
Oh yeah!

17:45.195 --> 17:47.197
<i
>- You know what would be great? - What?

17:47.197 --> 17:49.432
If we had a siren
and a flashing light.

17:53.871 --> 17:56.639
They got apps
for everything.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.581
Hey.

18:06.417 --> 18:09.119
- I think we gotta talk.
- I'm not in the mood.

18:09.119 --> 18:12.188
Oh, that wasn't very nice.

18:14.558 --> 18:17.760
Oh come on. When I said you
were nice that was a compliment.

18:17.760 --> 18:21.364
- That was the best thing you could say about me?
- I think that says a lot.

18:22.366 --> 18:24.767
Look, p.J.,

18:25.803 --> 18:28.104
As a father,
the most important thing to me

18:28.104 --> 18:30.473
Is that my kids are
good people--

18:30.473 --> 18:34.811
Kind-hearted, genuinely
concerned about other people...

18:34.811 --> 18:36.779
Nice.

18:38.282 --> 18:42.285
Hey, by that standard you're
the kid I'm most proud of.

18:43.721 --> 18:45.788
- Really?
- Really.

18:48.159 --> 18:49.826
Thanks, dad.

18:49.826 --> 18:53.429
Hey, thank you for helping me
out on the job today.

18:55.065 --> 18:56.766
Uh, you know, I was kinda

18:56.766 --> 18:59.235
Hoping maybe someday we could

18:59.235 --> 19:01.871
Make that a permanent thing.

19:04.241 --> 19:05.942
"duncan & son."

19:05.942 --> 19:06.692
Oh!

19:07.578 --> 19:09.812
That reminds me--
better hit those books.

19:15.352 --> 19:17.854
Well, that wasn't nice at all.

19:27.264 --> 19:30.533
Oh, what are you two doing here?
Did the party end early?

19:30.533 --> 19:32.835
No, we decided
not to go.

19:32.835 --> 19:35.605
The truth is

19:35.605 --> 19:38.508
We tricked you into giving us
permission to go to the party.

19:38.508 --> 19:41.077
Did you now?

19:42.580 --> 19:45.248
Yes, I'm ashamed
to say we did.

19:45.248 --> 19:48.985
But on the way there something
made us change our minds.

19:48.985 --> 19:50.587
And what's that?

19:50.587 --> 19:52.855
We saw the grape juice
billboard.

19:52.855 --> 19:55.191
You know the one where
the girl is hugging her mom

19:55.191 --> 19:57.293
Because she's so happy
with the juice?

20:00.064 --> 20:03.266
"grape moms think alike,"
I'm familiar with it.

20:05.035 --> 20:08.805
Anyway that got us to thinking
about how wonderful you two are

20:08.805 --> 20:11.941
And we talked it over and agreed
that you deserved better

20:11.941 --> 20:14.377
And decided not to go.

20:20.883 --> 20:24.887
Anyway, we know you're
probably gonna punish us,

20:24.887 --> 20:26.823
But we're okay with that.

20:29.093 --> 20:33.162
Well, we can talk
about that later.

20:34.999 --> 20:38.334
I'm really proud that
you guys told us the truth.

20:38.334 --> 20:40.703
I am too.

20:43.574 --> 20:45.808
Darn you
for raising us so well.

20:47.711 --> 20:50.046
It's what I do.

20:58.022 --> 21:00.390
Hey, ivy, I'm on my way out.
Are you here?

21:00.390 --> 21:02.191
I'm right in front
of your house.

21:02.191 --> 21:03.993
Are you sure
it's not too late to go?

21:03.993 --> 21:06.896
Oh, girlfriend, these
senior parties go all night.

21:06.896 --> 21:09.732
- Going somewhere?
- Back to bed.

21:09.732 --> 21:11.100
You got that right.

21:13.203 --> 21:15.438
Caught by mom.
Can't go.

21:15.438 --> 21:19.475
- If you're not going, I'm not going.
- You got that right.

21:29.753 --> 21:31.521
Hi, charlie.

21:33.490 --> 21:36.459
Charlie, come on.

21:36.459 --> 21:38.895
How many times do I have
to say I'm sorry?

21:41.999 --> 21:43.966
What is it gonna take
for you to forgive me?

21:43.966 --> 21:46.102
You baby.

21:46.102 --> 21:48.738
"you baby"?

21:48.738 --> 21:50.606
What does that mean?

21:53.811 --> 21:57.347
Well, charlie, I don't know
how you got him to do that,

21:57.347 --> 21:59.882
But thank you. We'll be
enjoying this for years.

21:59.882 --> 22:02.685
now say good luck, charlie.

22:04.421 --> 22:08.024
Do you want me to spit up?
'cause I'm not afraid to go there.

22:09.226 --> 22:11.394
Cranky baby.

22:17.959 --> 22:20.995
<i>We've got the house
surrounded. Come out with your hands up.</i>

22:23.966 --> 22:26.868
Hey, how's it going?
Good good.

22:26.868 --> 22:29.204
Remember a few weeks ago
I mentioned something about

22:29.204 --> 22:31.039
Cashing in my favors?

22:31.039 --> 22:34.743
Well, today's the day.
You two never saw me.

22:34.743 --> 22:37.612
Bye-bye now.

22:37.612 --> 22:40.548
<i>- come in.</i>

22:41.951 --> 22:43.985
He's upstairs, boys.

22:47.990 --> 22:51.426
- Why'd you give him up, mom?
- He didn't do the dishes.

22:51.426 --> 22:54.295
Don't cross mama.
