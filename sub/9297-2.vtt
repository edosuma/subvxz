Around the boston area today.

00:04.420 --> 00:08.970
It's a light day because of the holiday --
And even if you heading to logan airport,

00:09.010 --> 00:12.090
the traffic is flowing even
through the williams tunnel,

00:31.590 --> 00:32.880
You ready,janie.

00:32.920 --> 00:34.700
- Don't call me "janie."
- Okay,janie.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.870
He can call you whatever he wants.

00:37.910 --> 00:39.030
You're a traitor.

00:39.060 --> 00:40.240
And you're a choker.

00:40.270 --> 00:41.810
Yeah,I'm handling your
cheap cologne all right.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.510
Come on,grant.

00:43.550 --> 00:45.530
You've been working drugs too long.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.320
Good cut,good cut!

00:49.360 --> 00:50.960
My grandma could have hit that ball.

00:51.030 --> 00:52.420
Your grandma has balls.

00:52.490 --> 00:56.030
Stroke up!That's how
crystl bustos won the gold!

00:56.150 --> 00:57.950

- Yeah.

01:01.860 --> 01:04.250
- Never played.
- Love the uniform.

01:04.319 --> 01:07.690
Water-resistant,one-layer
skin made with dyneema.

01:07.770 --> 01:11.340
It's light and comfortable,actually,due
to intrinsic cooling properties.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.040
It fits nice,too.

01:15.380 --> 01:16.880
Let's go,janie!Crush it!

01:16.960 --> 01:18.690

Oh,she's letting me play.

No i.d.

02:31.910 --> 02:33.990
Was she dead before she was tossed?

02:34.020 --> 02:35.280
I'd be guessing.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.950
I won't tell.

02:37.060 --> 02:39.000
Ballpark?Two hours.

02:39.330 --> 02:40.510
"ballpark"?

02:40.580 --> 02:42.420
I guess I do owe you dinner.

02:42.670 --> 02:44.970
I love modern proven al.

02:45.010 --> 02:47.500
Oh,my god.You're
flirting over a dead body.

02:47.540 --> 02:49.070
When else am I going to do it?

02:49.130 --> 02:51.870
Caf?Cote d'azur,7:00?

02:52.920 --> 02:54.140
I'll call it in.

02:54.210 --> 02:56.620
Okay,you're drugs,we're homicide.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.480
We got it.

02:59.900 --> 03:00.910
Okay.

03:00.940 --> 03:02.020
It's your day off.

03:02.060 --> 03:03.420
I was just trying to help.

03:03.460 --> 03:05.380
- Thank you.
- See ya.

03:05.420 --> 03:06.690
Perfect enamel layer.

03:06.730 --> 03:08.590
No deterioration of abutting gingiva.

03:08.660 --> 03:09.870
English.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.360
She's a flosser.

03:11.430 --> 03:12.760
no witnesses.

03:12.830 --> 03:14.440
Not that many cars use this overpass.

03:14.510 --> 03:16.840
But frankie found this.

03:21.970 --> 03:24.450
1960s,chrysler,300f.

03:24.520 --> 03:25.900
Wedge engine.

03:25.970 --> 03:27.520
It's,uh,distinctive and pleasing.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.060
Yeah,it's from the suspect's car.

03:29.130 --> 03:31.590
You're never gonna make homicide you keep
jumping to conclusions like that,all right?

03:31.630 --> 03:33.610
You don't know where this came from.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.890
Get me everything you can,all right?

03:38.130 --> 03:39.400
He looks up to you.

03:39.470 --> 03:41.890
You're an only child.Get
yourself a brother,and we'll talk.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.980
hey,Can I borrow your radio?!

03:44.420 --> 03:46.110
Thanks a lot.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.690
I mean,yes,all right,I would like
to help him make homicide detective.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.970
But he's just... He's not ready.

03:52.010 --> 03:53.490
You are deceptively complex.

03:53.530 --> 03:55.750
I do not understand you.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.400
Well,you would if I was a dead body.

03:58.790 --> 04:00.700
Do you think so?

04:00.730 --> 04:03.250
Victor 825,I got a full notifications.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.250
I got one... Down here at revere park.

04:06.290 --> 04:08.560
Do you think it was deliberate?

04:09.970 --> 04:11.860
Well,somebody knew we were here.

04:11.910 --> 04:14.620
I'd say they want to play ball.

04:18.740 --> 04:20.560
Korsak,you okay?

04:25.110 --> 04:27.300
Aced your sergeant's exam.That's great.

04:27.330 --> 04:28.490
Save it.

04:28.570 --> 04:30.260
Passed me over.Again.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.800
It's juice.I don't got juice.

04:32.830 --> 04:34.720
No,no,it's -- It's
political,all right?

04:34.760 --> 04:38.120
How do you think I feel?They didn't
even let women in this unit till 1988.

04:38.150 --> 04:40.740
More people to get promoted
ahead of me -- great!

04:41.020 --> 04:42.270
Get up,get up,get up,get up.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.930
drug unit has more space.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.070
no,this is okay.

04:45.140 --> 04:48.950
Uh,lieutenant's office is through
there,empty since ray was promoted.

04:49.130 --> 04:51.390
You lost,joey?

04:53.010 --> 04:55.650
Can I talk to you for a
second,detective rizzoli?

04:57.170 --> 04:58.990
Yeah,why not?

05:02.620 --> 05:03.640
What do you want?

05:03.710 --> 05:05.460
Okay,look.I know you've
got a problem with me.

05:05.530 --> 05:10.360
"the habitual difficulty in prayer
is,"'a,' distraction,'b,' lack of grace,

05:10.440 --> 05:12.840
'c,' selfishness,or,'d,' dryness."

05:13.420 --> 05:14.770
- Dryness.
- no.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.060
You still don't know.

05:16.130 --> 05:17.590
You cheated off my catechism test.

05:17.660 --> 05:20.200
- We were 8 years old.And,no,I didn't.
- Yes,you did.

05:20.270 --> 05:23.950
And I know it was you who put a
mallard duck in my locker in 7th grade.

05:24.710 --> 05:26.570
You don't like cold duck?

05:26.600 --> 05:29.700
It crapped all over my math
homework.No,not so much.

05:29.740 --> 05:31.960
You and I are gonna have to
figure out some way to get along.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.180
why?

05:33.210 --> 05:34.960
Because i'm your new lieutenant.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.340
Commissioner gave me homicide command.

05:37.750 --> 05:38.770
Right.

05:38.810 --> 05:40.180
'cause you've got juice.

05:40.220 --> 05:42.060
And I might have kissed a
little brass on the way up.

05:42.090 --> 05:43.730
But I also made hundreds of cases.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.550
Korsak's made thousands.He
didn't get promoted.

05:45.620 --> 05:47.880
Korsak is sitting at
that desk for a reason.

05:47.950 --> 05:50.240
The same reason you'll be
sitting there in 20 years.

05:50.310 --> 05:52.290
You don't know how to get along.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.990
Me -- I'll barely have
time for a cup of coffee

05:55.060 --> 05:57.240
before I'm out of that
office and moving on up.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.070
Good.

06:00.260 --> 06:03.740
You know,you're exactly the same.

06:04.810 --> 06:07.890
And I'm gonna need everything
you got on that strangling victim.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.410
Yes,sir.

06:09.450 --> 06:11.120
Lieutenant,sir.

06:11.190 --> 06:13.000
That's strike one,rizzoli.

06:13.380 --> 06:14.670
You got two left.

06:14.740 --> 06:18.490
Ladies and gentlemen...
...i am your new lieutenant.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.620
I just want to say i'm very excited
to be working with all of you.

06:21.660 --> 06:23.210
I keep an open-door policy.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.620
Let's make this a tight-knit team.

06:24.700 --> 06:27.680
Oh,and... There will be no more
parking in front of the building.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.880
Oh,come on.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.040
It's a security issue.

06:37.470 --> 06:39.820
4-inch curvilinear contusion.

06:39.860 --> 06:41.400
See the patterned abrasions?

06:41.470 --> 06:42.850
From the terry cloth.

06:42.950 --> 06:46.820
He didn't use his hands,so she was clutching
at the ligature,fighting for her life.

06:46.860 --> 06:49.950
It takes 20 to 30 seconds to
render someone unconscious.

06:50.020 --> 06:53.510
One,postmortem trauma...
Two,postmortem trauma...

06:53.580 --> 06:55.360
- No,I got it.Strangling sucks.
- ...three,postmortem

06:55.390 --> 06:56.750
Depends who you're choking.

06:56.790 --> 06:58.020
Can you believe that?

06:58.090 --> 07:00.740
I get kicked to the
curb,grant gets the brass ring.

07:00.780 --> 07:03.280
Well,he's a -- A
legend in the drug unit.

07:03.350 --> 07:05.430
Perhaps he's a little
nicer off the mound.

07:05.460 --> 07:08.010
Oh,yeah,he's fantastic.I
want to kill myself.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.770
What's the best way?

07:09.840 --> 07:13.080
Uh,atlanto-occipital
disarticulation is very fast.

07:13.230 --> 07:15.380
No idea what that is.What else you got?

07:15.450 --> 07:17.270
I miss anything?

07:17.310 --> 07:19.220
We were just about to
start the "y" incision.

07:19.260 --> 07:20.830
Oh,goody.

07:21.050 --> 07:22.600
Gore never bothered me.

07:22.670 --> 07:25.880
My first autopsy was a burn
victim,hands curled up like this.

07:25.930 --> 07:28.020
Guys thought i'd turn
into a little girl.

07:28.050 --> 07:30.860
Grabbed the fingers,looking for some
skin to rehydrate and get a print.

07:30.930 --> 07:33.300
Snapped off,like pretzels.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.990
Knock it off,korsak.

07:35.060 --> 07:36.620
Sink.

07:36.660 --> 07:38.020
You hungry,frost?

07:38.390 --> 07:40.290
You want to grab a tomato soup.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.680
You want to know what I'm thinking?

07:44.750 --> 07:46.560
It's so weird.I do.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.320
I'm thinking I know why
you're making such a big deal

07:48.360 --> 07:50.410
out of the fact that
grant's your new boss.

07:50.450 --> 07:51.730
I don't want to know
what you're thinking.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.440
- You two like each other.
- no.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.160
Do you know what that
ass used to call me?

07:55.200 --> 07:56.920
Frog face.

07:56.990 --> 07:58.290
It's not funny,maura.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.840
It's
-- no.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.250
- It's not funny.
- I'm not a frog face.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.950
no.

08:04.790 --> 08:07.950
You know,I have an hour to finish
this before dinner with my hot new guy.

08:07.990 --> 08:11.190
Oh,my god.It's gnocchi
night.Listen.Um,I'll call you.

08:11.260 --> 08:13.140
Later,okay?

08:25.200 --> 08:26.490
Who invited you?

08:26.570 --> 08:27.960
Nice to see you,too.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.680
- Hi,daddy.
- Hi,honey.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.360
Hello,jo friday.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.320
- Hello.Yes,I know.
- Come on,swing!

08:34.360 --> 08:37.520
Don't let that dog lick
you.It's unsanitary.

08:37.590 --> 08:39.890
So,I hear you got a pinch
hitter tossed into your game.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.559
Yeah,frankie told you
about the strangling victim.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.520
Okay,that's not dinner talk.

08:43.590 --> 08:44.930
- We're not eating.
- We're not eating,ma.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.340
By the way,you're the one who wanted
to learn how to make grandma's gnocchi.

08:48.380 --> 08:50.370
Okay,okay.I'm coming.

08:51.930 --> 08:55.120
Aw,come on,ma.You didn't put the potato
peels down the garbage disposal.Come on.

08:55.150 --> 08:57.800
Well,if you were home a little more,I
would have known not to do that.

08:57.830 --> 08:59.250
Oh,come on!Tag him!

08:59.320 --> 09:01.330
Aw,dad,can we get a little help,please?

09:01.370 --> 09:02.340
Yeah,what's the problem?

09:02.380 --> 09:04.240
You're always
working.That's the problem.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.470
Ang,come on.Leave her alone.

09:05.540 --> 09:06.830
Janie,where are the tools?

09:06.860 --> 09:08.240
Uh,in the hallway.

09:08.310 --> 09:10.590
Frankie,give me a hand
over here,all right?

09:10.630 --> 09:12.580
- Okay.
- Thank you,daddy.

09:15.130 --> 09:17.030
Daddy needs help.

09:17.210 --> 09:18.390
Dad,what do you need?

09:18.430 --> 09:19.750
What did you say?

09:19.830 --> 09:21.780
Nothing.Everything's okay.

09:22.040 --> 09:25.740
He needs frankie jr.To
take over the business.

09:25.780 --> 09:31.690
I mean,frankie belongs at rizzoli
and sons,not out on the streets.

09:31.760 --> 09:34.250
He's not a homeless
person.He's a cop,ma.

09:34.320 --> 09:37.210
Just point out to him all
the things you've missed,okay?

09:37.280 --> 09:39.160
He listens to you.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.880
The things I -- W-
what have I missed?

09:40.920 --> 09:42.180
What,a clogged sink?

09:42.220 --> 09:44.860
No,like... Children who love you.

09:44.930 --> 09:46.520
A husband who adores you.

09:46.550 --> 09:49.710
Damn it.Ang,why did you do this?

09:49.780 --> 09:52.730
Okay,did I know that you couldn't
put the potatoes in the sink?

09:52.770 --> 09:54.700
Just fix it.You know how to do that.

09:54.730 --> 09:56.140
Well,next time,think.

09:56.170 --> 09:58.920
Okay,I'll -- I'll
do that.I'll think.

09:59.610 --> 10:01.030
Frankie needs a wife.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.830
Why?He has you.

10:03.860 --> 10:06.450
- No!No,you're not...
- No,no.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.340
Rizzoli.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.460
All right,i'll be right there.

10:11.500 --> 10:12.560
Did you catch another homicide?

10:12.640 --> 10:13.830
None of your business.

10:13.870 --> 10:16.610
- Fix my sink.
- Okay,princess.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.860
He tucked her in.

10:19.930 --> 10:23.100
When's the last time we had
two stranglings in one day?

10:23.330 --> 10:26.000
Well,cheer up.Maybe tomorrow
will be stabbing day.

10:27.190 --> 10:28.620
I don't -- I- I
don't like this.

10:28.660 --> 10:31.010
It's the same m.o.As the softball girl.

10:34.040 --> 10:37.260
Sophie
clark -- 22.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.670
What are you doing here?

10:42.220 --> 10:44.560
I'm working.It's my sector.

10:44.640 --> 10:45.770
Since when?

10:45.800 --> 10:47.480
Since I asked for a new sector.

10:47.550 --> 10:49.770
I want to learn from the best.

10:50.860 --> 10:53.080
So,whereiskorsak?

10:54.030 --> 10:55.540
That's funny.That's great.

10:55.580 --> 10:57.070
- You like that?
- Yeah.

10:57.110 --> 10:59.210
Well,you're welcome.

10:59.830 --> 11:01.640
Rizzoli.

11:02.590 --> 11:04.360
Okay,thanks.

11:04.440 --> 11:06.870
We've got an i.d.On the first victim.

11:07.110 --> 11:10.380
Mary sullivan,sophie...clark.

11:11.330 --> 11:14.130
That's weird.Uh,run it again.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.220
Check the cold case database.

11:16.250 --> 11:18.340
- why?
- Just do it.

11:20.110 --> 11:24.330
oh,wow,sophie clark... Was a
victim of the boston strangler,1962.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.610
He got mary sullivan in '64.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.670
Yeah,we got him in
'67-- Albert desalvo.

11:29.710 --> 11:31.030
He confessed to all 13 of the murders.

11:31.070 --> 11:33.300
- He died in prison in...
- Uh,'73.

11:33.380 --> 11:34.780
Stabbed by an inmate.

11:34.810 --> 11:36.960
Rizzoli,think.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.490
We got two new
stranglings -- Same names.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.910
It's a bizarre coincidence.

11:43.090 --> 11:45.160
- Or we've got a copycat.
- no.

11:45.230 --> 11:48.290
Some veteran cops never believed
desalvo was the boston strangler.

11:48.330 --> 11:49.590
Yeah,lots of cops do.

11:49.630 --> 11:51.220
So why is it a cold case?

11:51.300 --> 11:53.760
An open homicide investigation,jane.

11:53.830 --> 11:55.850
Never solved.

11:56.390 --> 11:59.230
Come on.What are you telling
me?That the boston strangler is back?

12:15.140 --> 12:16.920
I was 10 when it started.

12:16.950 --> 12:20.090
The city went bonkers --
Panic like you've never seen.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.680
Yeah,probably because women were
being strangled in their own apartments

12:22.750 --> 12:25.760
from '62 to '64 and the
boston cops couldn't catch him.

12:25.830 --> 12:27.270
People don't like that.

12:27.340 --> 12:29.460
My mom still talks about it.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.350
People were furious with the cops.

12:31.420 --> 12:34.200
The bosses would have done anything
to get the public off their backs.

12:34.270 --> 12:37.310
It was like jack the
ripper found boston.

12:37.530 --> 12:39.900
Yeah,you're forgetting one
thing -- Desalvo confessed.

12:39.940 --> 12:41.350
Because he loved the attention.

12:41.390 --> 12:43.340
Told you --
bana head.

12:43.380 --> 12:45.240
All right,then how did he know details?

12:45.320 --> 12:47.690
You know,the apartment layouts,the
way the bodies were strangled.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.020
Read his interviews.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.120
He was a serial rapist
in and out of the clink.

12:51.190 --> 12:53.180
Shared a cell with the real
strangler is what some think.

12:53.210 --> 12:54.840
Korsak,it's been 40 years.

12:54.910 --> 12:56.760
Even if the "real" strangler
has been behind bars

12:56.830 --> 12:59.610
and he just got paroled,he'd
-- he'd be in his 60s.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.480
Hey,mick jagger's in his 60s.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.930
Oh,well,that's our first suspect.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.410
I was a little disappointed when
I moved to boston and found out

13:07.450 --> 13:09.810
that paul revere didn't
actually do the midnight ride.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.080
Oh,yeah,yeah.I know what you mean.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.410
I mean,I understand --
Longfellow couldn't write,

13:14.440 --> 13:17.990
"listen,my children,and you shall hear
the midnight ride of william...dawes."

13:18.760 --> 13:20.380
Still.

13:20.540 --> 13:22.610
Is there anything that you don't know?

13:23.320 --> 13:25.000
Of course.

13:26.060 --> 13:30.400
I read an article about the initial
plasma state,uh,that followed the big bang.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.550
And the universe was at its
highest level of entropy,

13:33.590 --> 13:38.720
which was...fascinating,and
you don't really care.

13:39.410 --> 13:42.050
I...i like science.

13:42.090 --> 13:43.870
No apologies.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.910
I likeyou.

13:56.110 --> 13:59.160
Your skin is a little... Rough.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.280
I'm sorry.I shaved.

14:04.140 --> 14:06.270
Abnormal joint flexibility.

14:06.350 --> 14:08.740
I would be happy to show you that later.

14:09.430 --> 14:11.420
Do you have flat feet?

14:12.170 --> 14:16.340
That's really second-date
material,but...yeah.

14:18.070 --> 14:19.330
Shoot.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.310
Nearsighted?

14:21.670 --> 14:23.180
Yeah.

14:23.220 --> 14:24.890
why?

14:24.920 --> 14:27.120
Marfan syndrome.

14:27.690 --> 14:30.260
Yeah,it explains the dolichostenomelia.

14:30.330 --> 14:32.240
Excuse me.The doli-what?

14:32.270 --> 14:33.980
Dolichostenomelia.

14:34.050 --> 14:36.110
Sorry,e
- elongated limbs.

14:36.180 --> 14:38.840
You're suffering from a genetic
disorder of the connective tissue.

14:38.890 --> 14:41.430
It's called marfan syndrome.

14:42.620 --> 14:46.040
If this is your idea of
foreplay,it's not working.

14:46.080 --> 14:49.810
No,it -- the heart damage
is the biggest issue.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.960
- But life expectancy has increased considerably.
- What?

14:53.030 --> 14:57.280
Nate -- wait,I'm... Nate,nate,why
are you -- Where are you going?

14:57.310 --> 14:59.180
Call my doctor.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.470
Good night.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.510
Well,I didn't believe it either.

15:05.580 --> 15:07.140
But then I went through
the evidence,all right?

15:07.180 --> 15:10.120
The strangler had a signature way
of tying the ligatures into a bow.

15:10.190 --> 15:11.720
Yeah,but that's all public record.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.030
No,no,no,not this detail.That
was never released.

15:14.070 --> 15:15.640
so,What are you telling me?

15:15.720 --> 15:16.770
Are you telling me
that,more than 40 years

15:16.810 --> 15:19.620
after the boston strangler stopped
killing,the -- the guy's back?

15:19.660 --> 15:20.650
Well,maybe.Yeah.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.570
How is that possible,detective?

15:22.610 --> 15:24.080
- He's dead.
- No.No.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.590
Desalvo,the guy who confessed,is dead.

15:26.630 --> 15:29.150
What if,this whole time,the
real boston strangler

15:29.190 --> 15:31.270
has been behind bars and now he's out?

15:31.310 --> 15:33.050
We -- track the
timeline.Look,okay.

15:33.090 --> 15:35.630
The killings stopped after
desalvo was locked up,right?

15:35.670 --> 15:37.940
They start up again two days ago.

15:38.110 --> 15:39.410
no.

15:39.450 --> 15:40.880
I
- it's a different guy.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.150
It's the same m.o.

15:42.220 --> 15:44.100
He -- he -- he goes after
women who live alone.

15:44.180 --> 15:46.270
There's no sign of forced
entry,so he either knows them,

15:46.310 --> 15:48.280
or he talks his way in.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.360
I mean,come on,he's picking victims

15:50.390 --> 15:53.380
with the same names as
the boston strangler.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.390
I mean,this guy's practically
yelling,"i'm back!"

15:55.470 --> 15:56.720
we -- we got to
find these women.

15:56.760 --> 15:58.450
- We got to warn them.
- No,we don't.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.660
Okay,it's not gonna happen.

16:00.730 --> 16:05.230
Two words I do not want to hear together
again -- "boston" and "strangler."

16:05.350 --> 16:07.370
That case nearly buried this city.

16:07.450 --> 16:11.960
So... Ignore the obvious links?

16:12.030 --> 16:17.680
I am telling you that these new murders
have nothing to do with the boston strangler.

16:18.610 --> 16:22.230
If you want to work here,solve them.

16:25.160 --> 16:29.550
You know,I remember you when you cared
more about the people than the politics.

16:33.020 --> 16:34.220
What did you bring me down here for?

16:34.260 --> 16:35.360
we're gonna crack this case.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.070
In the basement?

16:37.140 --> 16:38.780
Know what's up there?

16:38.810 --> 16:41.220
Yes,that is where I take my naps.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.960
All the old files of the
boston strangler case.

16:45.160 --> 16:47.520
I thought those were locked
away in a vault somewhere.

16:47.750 --> 16:48.960
Even better.

16:49.030 --> 16:50.930
They misfiled the evidence on purpose.

16:50.970 --> 16:53.280
Here,hold the light.I'll get
a ladder.We'll get them down.

16:57.120 --> 16:58.540
Hey,listen to this.

16:58.610 --> 17:00.220
Desalvo wrote a poem.

17:00.290 --> 17:02.250
"people everywhere are still in doubt.

17:02.330 --> 17:05.450
Is the strangler in
prison or roaming about?"

17:10.020 --> 17:11.990
o'malley?

17:12.190 --> 17:13.460
Worked with him.

17:13.540 --> 17:15.690
Died of a heart attack at 40.

17:15.740 --> 17:18.420
Fitzgerald
-- Great cop.

17:20.150 --> 17:22.410
Shot his wife,then himself.

17:23.079 --> 17:26.869
This case...killed a lot
of good men,good careers.

17:26.940 --> 17:28.740
gee,I can't wait to dive in.

17:28.810 --> 17:30.920
Leahy.I forgot about him.

17:30.990 --> 17:32.300
I know where to find him.

17:32.380 --> 17:33.740
Come on.He's a great guy.

17:33.770 --> 17:36.410
W- wait,I-I want maura
to look at some of this.

17:36.450 --> 17:38.020
Well,you're gonna have
to smuggle it out,then.

17:38.060 --> 17:39.850
You don't need this.Give me this.

17:50.450 --> 17:51.790
Kenny.

17:51.830 --> 17:53.530
Vince korsak.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.900
Korsak.

17:56.110 --> 17:57.970
Kid,you haven't aged very good.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.810
Oh,you look the same.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.030
Mind if we join you?This
is detective rizzoli.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.810
- Hello.
- Detective,huh?

18:05.010 --> 18:07.560
I heard they was
putting girls on the job.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.280
Yeah,they even let
us drive our own cars.

18:12.680 --> 18:15.620
I'm familiar with the great work
you did on the strangler case.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.710
The boston strangler,huh?

18:19.980 --> 18:22.010
Case ruined my life.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.310
Cost me my wife and kid.

18:24.810 --> 18:27.100
They threw me out of homicide.

18:27.750 --> 18:29.630
detective,what if you were right?

18:29.700 --> 18:31.820
What is albert desalvo really
wasn't the boston strangler,

18:31.850 --> 18:34.280
like you were trying to tell everybody?

18:34.320 --> 18:36.420
It doesn't make much
difference what I thought.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.000
But you thought they had the wrong guy.

18:38.060 --> 18:39.940
They did.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.110
And if he's alive,he's still out there.

18:45.540 --> 18:46.910
Detective,wait.

18:46.950 --> 18:48.920
Look.You were once a good cop.

18:48.950 --> 18:50.650
I'm a good cop,even though I'm a girl.

18:50.690 --> 18:53.950
I- if you -- if you think of
anything,please give us a call.

18:54.610 --> 18:56.880
Good to see you,mac.

19:05.950 --> 19:07.210
Find anything?

19:08.910 --> 19:11.000
Very sophisticated killer.

19:11.270 --> 19:13.860
No forensic evidence
so far on either victim.

19:24.390 --> 19:26.420
Sink.

19:33.850 --> 19:37.530
Korsak's calling me
b.k.-- Barf bag kid.

19:37.970 --> 19:40.000
Crowe's leaving plastic puke everywhere.

19:40.030 --> 19:43.150
You're not the first detective
to be sickened by death.

19:43.220 --> 19:45.680
You just have to find your morgue legs.

19:47.630 --> 19:52.030
I read a study that said people can conquer
this kind of thing with repeated exposure.

19:52.410 --> 19:54.850
Like when you're afraid
of dogs or flying.

19:55.450 --> 19:56.660
Immersion therapy.

19:56.730 --> 19:58.450
Very effective.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.300
It worked for me.

20:00.330 --> 20:02.350
What wereyouafraid of?

20:03.320 --> 20:04.900
People.

20:04.940 --> 20:06.840
Live ones.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.970
She'll never judge me,tease me.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.420
And I can help her.

20:15.460 --> 20:17.920
I can speak for the dead.

20:22.660 --> 20:24.630
Come here.Come.Right.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.220
Now we're just gonna --
We're gonna open her up.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.840
We're gonna take a little look inside.

20:36.380 --> 20:38.440
Okay,now breathe deep.

20:38.890 --> 20:41.010
Actually,don't inhale.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.390
Just follow my finger.

20:44.450 --> 20:46.190
Whoa,look at you.

20:46.380 --> 20:49.860
Hey...jane.Um...thank you.

20:49.900 --> 20:53.010
Um...i'll be upstairs.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.490
Well,no,I
- I don't want to interrupt.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.460
No,it's okay.I don't want
to get in your guys' way.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.100
What?

21:02.260 --> 21:05.080
You'd want to know if you had
marfan syndrome,wouldn't you?

21:05.130 --> 21:06.270
You did it again?

21:06.350 --> 21:08.210
I know.

21:11.170 --> 21:14.980
ooh,Cobalt blue slingback.

21:15.010 --> 21:17.460
All right,look,come here.

21:17.530 --> 21:19.630
Take a few cuts off of this.It
will make you feel better.

21:20.260 --> 21:21.750
Okay.

21:22.010 --> 21:22.990
- All right.
- Yes.

21:23.030 --> 21:25.530
- All right.Let's see it.
- Right.

21:28.410 --> 21:30.500
This is an optimum batting stance.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.320
Really,who says?Pee-wee herman?

21:32.360 --> 21:35.310
It's classic rigid body collision
theory,not pee-wee herman.

21:35.350 --> 21:37.150
No,fine.

21:37.220 --> 21:39.170
- You're ruining a national pastime.
- Don't take my bat.

21:39.250 --> 21:42.610
Let go,let go.Look what
I brought you -- Presents.

21:42.650 --> 21:44.730
I like presents.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.270
What do we have here?

21:51.460 --> 21:52.880
What?

21:53.470 --> 21:55.750
- Oh,darn it.
- What?

21:55.780 --> 21:58.100
I thought it was an original mary quant.

21:58.630 --> 22:00.500
I thought you found something useful.

22:00.530 --> 22:02.520
Well,miniskirts freed women.

22:02.590 --> 22:04.800
They were practical and liberating.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.720
Can you get dna off of it?

22:06.790 --> 22:07.900
no.

22:07.940 --> 22:11.900
No,it -- it's been handled by hundreds
of people,and it wasn't stored properly.

22:12.170 --> 22:13.670
Well,we better come up with something,

22:13.740 --> 22:17.400
or there are gonna be a lot more women
with bows tied around their necks.

22:23.420 --> 22:24.830
This -- This
is helen blake.

22:24.930 --> 22:26.310
- Okay.
- All right.

22:26.520 --> 22:29.990
- Okay,and after that -- You said
I wouldn't make a good detective.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.560
That's not what I said.

22:31.620 --> 22:36.350
All right,look -- We got 294 women with
the same last names as the other 11 victims.

22:36.410 --> 22:39.520
- And we got to find a way to
let them know -- Open it up.

22:39.590 --> 22:43.790
I took a bunch of photos at the softball field
and -- and at your second vic's apartment.

22:43.840 --> 22:47.450
And you're always saying that the killer
mighttry to sightsee in a crowd of ghouls,so...

22:47.520 --> 22:49.600
Thank you.Thank you so much.

22:49.630 --> 22:50.560
- All right.
- Thanks.

22:50.640 --> 22:53.400
A-aren't you even gonna look at them?

22:53.460 --> 22:54.640
Can't right now.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.800
There's a strangler on the loose.

22:56.870 --> 22:58.310
Rizzoli!

22:58.360 --> 22:59.840
- Hey,frankie.
- Hey,lieu.

22:59.910 --> 23:02.140
Hey,come find me later.I
need to talk to you.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.430
Sure.

23:04.860 --> 23:06.820
Thanks.Really nice first day.

23:06.860 --> 23:11.940
I got the mayor,the commissioner,every news
agency,hell,I even got my own mother crawling up my ass.

23:11.980 --> 23:13.280
I'm not your leak.

23:13.360 --> 23:14.920
Can't stand the heat,go
back to the drug unit.

23:15.010 --> 23:16.600
Strike two,rizzoli.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.430
I am working the case!

23:18.500 --> 23:20.230
Really?Let's see.

23:20.300 --> 23:22.960
Oh,I get it -- you're gonna call every
mary sullivan in the state of massachusetts

23:23.020 --> 23:25.230
and tell her the boston
strangler's looking for her.

23:25.370 --> 23:27.500
I am setting up a task force.

23:27.610 --> 23:30.460
From now on,everything in
this case runs through me.

23:30.510 --> 23:33.300
And I want updates from
you every 10 minutes.

23:33.650 --> 23:35.940
Hey,they're towing your car,rizzoli.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.060
What?

23:41.180 --> 23:43.670
Told you not to park out front.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.800
Hi,sorry.Excuse me.

23:54.650 --> 23:56.950
Come on.Did you tow my car?

23:57.060 --> 23:59.380
Only reason I didn't
is because of this guy.

23:59.910 --> 24:01.550
Thanks,big mo.I owe you one.

24:01.590 --> 24:04.230
- Hey,it's good seeing you again.Long time,right?
- Yeah.

24:04.250 --> 24:06.900
- Take it easy.
- Next time,i'm taking it,rizzoli.

24:07.150 --> 24:08.890
Oh,good.

24:09.030 --> 24:10.150
Thank you.

24:10.240 --> 24:14.660
Well,us detectives got to stick
together,'cause the bosses are all idiots,right?

24:14.780 --> 24:16.540
Yes,they are.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.760
What are you doing here?

24:18.850 --> 24:21.780
I,uh -- I asked around after
I read about the stranglings,

24:21.810 --> 24:26.210
and,uh,well,the word is
that you're a good cop.

24:28.370 --> 24:30.760
I thought maybe you could use this.

24:31.730 --> 24:33.200
This is your personal file.

24:33.300 --> 24:36.110
Yeah,can you believe I
kept it all these years?

24:36.190 --> 24:38.210
It's always eating at me,too.

24:38.270 --> 24:41.750
You know,we all have that one case,you know,y
- you never really close?

24:41.810 --> 24:44.680
Well,this one is mine.

24:44.790 --> 24:46.360
Thank you for trusting me with it.

24:46.400 --> 24:50.970
Yeah,look,uh... It ain't
easy for an old fart like me

24:51.040 --> 24:55.970
to see a woman doing this
job,but youarea good cop.

24:56.020 --> 24:57.860
How did you know?

24:57.920 --> 25:01.230
Well,I spent 30 years working
with a lot of bad ones.

25:02.270 --> 25:05.160
Tell me,uh,you married?

25:05.240 --> 25:06.590
no.

25:06.610 --> 25:08.230
That's too bad.

25:08.300 --> 25:10.170
Uh,no,it's by choice.

25:10.210 --> 25:12.450
Why's that?

25:14.040 --> 25:17.760
Because any man I could love
wouldn't want me doing this job.

25:17.830 --> 25:19.990
And I love this job.

25:20.070 --> 25:23.000
Well,this job can break your heart,too.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.840
Good luck,detective.

25:27.930 --> 25:30.470
"detective suspended."

25:36.190 --> 25:38.530
Mug shot.Who's this?

25:38.600 --> 25:40.120
See a name?

25:40.170 --> 25:42.240
Yeah.Redmond jones.

25:47.790 --> 25:50.610
Armed robbery,rape,man-two.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.220
Guy's a dirtbag.

25:52.310 --> 25:54.680
He's been locked up since 1967.

25:55.900 --> 25:58.460
Stabbed a guard,got 40 more years.

25:58.540 --> 26:00.790
And he was paroled last week.

26:01.250 --> 26:04.170
Two days before our first
victim was strangled.

26:04.530 --> 26:07.020
Let's contact leahy.

26:08.860 --> 26:10.850
Redmond jones.

26:10.900 --> 26:12.250
Career criminal.

26:12.310 --> 26:16.070
Aggravated assault,rape,arson
-- you name it.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.300
Born bad.

26:20.110 --> 26:21.380
who is it?

26:21.450 --> 26:23.290
It's the boston police,ma'am.

26:23.350 --> 26:25.430
They always come home to their mother.

26:28.990 --> 26:33.340
You
worthless,fat-assed,piece-of-crap cop.

26:33.380 --> 26:35.520
I remember you.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.470
It's redmond's mommy.

26:39.450 --> 26:41.190
Uh,where's your son,ma'am?

26:41.270 --> 26:46.940
Now,why would a skinny,greaseball,dyke
detective be looking for my son?

26:47.020 --> 26:49.620
- Ma'am -- Oh,holy
mother,and all the saints,

26:49.700 --> 26:52.830
they sent in us one of those
affirmative-action cops.

26:52.890 --> 26:55.220
What island are you from,honey?

26:55.260 --> 26:57.070
Does he speak english?

26:57.140 --> 26:58.290
Uh,you guys are doing great.

26:58.390 --> 27:02.170
I
- I think i'll check around back,before I strangle the old bitch.

27:02.220 --> 27:05.040
You go.That's right.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.440
Where was redmond yesterday?

27:06.490 --> 27:10.470
At home,having tea and
conversating with his mother.

27:10.570 --> 27:12.190
I'll kill you,you bastard!

27:12.260 --> 27:14.000
Son of a bitch!

27:14.090 --> 27:15.420
Thanks a lot.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.760
cut it out!

27:18.940 --> 27:20.530
- Come on!
- Okay,okay!Calm down!

27:20.620 --> 27:21.750
Are you okay,buddy?

27:22.390 --> 27:24.720
- Hey,come on,man!
- Hey!Come on!That's enough.

27:24.780 --> 27:27.630
The old pig started it 45 years ago!

27:27.710 --> 27:29.820
- And I'll finish it,too,you --
What the hell is wrong with you?

27:29.890 --> 27:31.170
You looking to get arrested?

27:31.220 --> 27:33.120
Arrest him.He's the boston strangler.

27:33.210 --> 27:36.550
If they had done it when I told them
to,all those girls would still be alive.

27:36.620 --> 27:39.910
Maybe it's you doing all the
killing,you whiskey-faced mick pig!

27:39.980 --> 27:41.690
I'm the boston freaking strangler.

27:41.730 --> 27:44.450
I strangled little girls while I
was hooked up to a dialysis machine.

27:44.510 --> 27:49.050
I hope you die nice and
slow,you fat-paddy leprechaun.

27:49.130 --> 27:51.680
Hit me again!I could
use a million bucks!

27:51.770 --> 27:54.470
Go to the car!Just go to the car!

28:00.020 --> 28:03.270
Hey,you can't go in
there without a warrant.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.440
Sure,I can.It's in plain view.

28:05.510 --> 28:07.970
Now,back off!

28:15.380 --> 28:17.170
Frost.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.850
Isn't that the hubcap
that frankie found?

28:20.900 --> 28:22.780
Hey,nice car.Where is it?

28:22.850 --> 28:25.010
Stolen.The day I got out.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.470
- You report it?
- Oh,yeah.Sure,I did.

28:27.510 --> 28:28.710
Hello,pig.

28:28.740 --> 28:30.860
Maybe you didn't report it
because you stole it yourself.

28:30.910 --> 28:34.010
That's right -- Kept
it perfect for 40 years,

28:34.080 --> 28:37.220
dumped it in the marina
to see if it could swim.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.650
I'll put an apb out on the car.

28:38.700 --> 28:42.660
Yeah,you do that.You find
it,I want it back,you wop pig.

28:42.710 --> 28:45.040
Nice family.

28:50.290 --> 28:52.100
***

28:52.220 --> 28:53.600
checked kenny's alibi.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.030
He's on kidney dialysis
four days a week.

28:56.090 --> 28:57.700
Confirmed hewasthere
during the stranglings.

28:57.740 --> 28:59.480
- All right.
- what are you looking at kenny for?

28:59.540 --> 29:01.310
You an internal-affairs
rat or something?

29:01.380 --> 29:02.960
Hey,easy.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.060
Why would you make
sure a cop has an alibi?

29:05.210 --> 29:08.760
Come on,vince.We're just tying
up some loose ends,all right?

29:08.800 --> 29:11.070
Got to make sure some
jackass named lieutenant grant

29:11.140 --> 29:13.070
doesn't accuse me of
doing shoddy police work.

29:13.160 --> 29:16.250
What -- who is this,and why is
he at all of our crime scenes?

29:19.290 --> 29:22.160
I'll run his face through
facial recognition.

29:23.860 --> 29:25.870
- Close.
- Yeah.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.270
Ah,we have a winner,folks.

29:29.370 --> 29:30.700
Let's check on the web for this guy.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.970
Well,that's the first
problem.His mom named him sandy.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.530
Put this one the wall.

29:34.600 --> 29:35.940
Nice website.

29:36.010 --> 29:37.260
Really?

29:37.320 --> 29:41.670
You can't bowl or collect ships in a
bottle.You've got to do this for a hobby.

29:43.250 --> 29:47.900
every detail of the new strangling
victims is on this guy's blog.

29:55.620 --> 29:57.510
Boston police.Open up.

30:05.110 --> 30:06.370
Clear.

30:08.890 --> 30:12.510
Get up!Stand up!Get up!Hands all
the way up!Up against the wall!

30:14.800 --> 30:16.750
Get on the bed!

30:28.440 --> 30:30.450
Oh,we got a live one.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.010
I'm curious as to why you
were at our crime scenes.

30:36.190 --> 30:37.900
You like strangling,sandy?

30:37.980 --> 30:40.360
My name's Dr.K,yo.

30:40.420 --> 30:43.420
Me and Dr.Kevorkian
are death enthusiasts.

30:43.480 --> 30:45.030
Ain't nothing illegal about that.

30:45.100 --> 30:49.020
Interference with a police officer
during performance of duty is.

30:51.090 --> 30:54.570
Hey,if I confess,can I look at
the bodies you got in the morgue?

30:56.460 --> 30:59.130
Rizzoli,we've got a third victim.

31:01.460 --> 31:05.420
Liver temp indicates she
died within the last hour.

31:05.980 --> 31:08.470
So it's not our "death enthusiast."

31:08.550 --> 31:10.960
Well,at least he's not blogging.

31:11.020 --> 31:14.070
Thanks for pointing out the bright side.

31:14.120 --> 31:19.460
Researchers at the university of pittsburgh
have proven that optimistic people live longer.

31:20.110 --> 31:22.870
So she was a pessimist?

31:23.010 --> 31:26.180
Joanne
graff -- 29.

31:26.520 --> 31:32.730
A joanne graff was strangled in
1962... By the boston strangler.

31:36.510 --> 31:38.800
Maura.

31:41.680 --> 31:43.980
What do you see?

31:44.040 --> 31:46.510
A reddish-brown stain.

31:46.820 --> 31:48.130
In other words,blood.

31:48.190 --> 31:52.020
no,A reddish-brownish stain.The
crime lab will determine what it is.

31:52.190 --> 31:54.850
No signs of lacerations
or abrasions on the victim.

31:54.900 --> 31:59.300
So it's not hers,which means we might have
gotten lucky and the killer was bleeding.

32:00.330 --> 32:02.660
Or smearing reddish-brownish stuff.

32:02.820 --> 32:04.670
- thanks.
- we get luck Red's car has been located.

32:04.730 --> 32:06.450
Towing it to evidence now.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.830
see?You just got to remain optimistic.

32:21.980 --> 32:24.060
hey,Move that to evidence!

32:24.210 --> 32:25.690
You can't park there,rizzoli.

32:25.810 --> 32:27.660
Move that to an evidence bay.

32:27.750 --> 32:29.040
I can't.They're all full.

32:36.040 --> 32:38.410
Oh,really?You're just gonna keep
your car parked right there,huh?

32:38.460 --> 32:40.770
Me and the batmobile,we're
gonna stay right here.

33:17.220 --> 33:18.540
oh,come on.Oh,come on,damn it!Stop!

33:18.590 --> 33:19.900
You got your evidence,rizzoli.

33:21.320 --> 33:23.060
Damn it!

33:28.390 --> 33:30.650
Not now,maura.I'm in a bad mood.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.100
What?

33:36.400 --> 33:38.300
Maura,what's up?

33:38.660 --> 33:42.470
Great news -- We got a hit on the blood
you found on the second victim's blouse.

33:42.590 --> 33:43.820
Who does it belong to?

33:43.910 --> 33:45.830
Redmond jones.

33:46.980 --> 33:49.000
Guys,I think we just
found the boston strangler.

33:49.930 --> 33:51.580
We should let lieutenant grant know.

33:51.670 --> 33:54.210
Let's bring this sucker home.

33:56.830 --> 33:59.060
Rizzoli,hey.

33:59.190 --> 34:01.300
The task force will take it from here.

34:01.360 --> 34:02.620
Y
- you can't do that.It's my case.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.900
Well,you're part of the task force.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.460
Come along if you like.

34:06.550 --> 34:09.580
Yeah.Come alongIt'll be fun.

34:10.850 --> 34:12.050
He asked me,janie.

34:12.110 --> 34:15.270
You're squeezing the
orange,huh,frankie?You getting some juice?

34:15.400 --> 34:17.199
That's a fast way to make detective.

34:17.449 --> 34:19.810
Grant put me on the task
force.What do you want me to do?

34:19.889 --> 34:20.889
Say no?

34:20.940 --> 34:23.139
Yeah,frankie!

34:23.270 --> 34:24.690
mom?

34:25.830 --> 34:27.600
dad?

34:28.219 --> 34:30.170
Hi,daddy.

34:30.810 --> 34:32.080
Janie,you okay?

34:32.159 --> 34:32.780
- Yeah.
- you sure

34:32.840 --> 34:34.900
Yeah.Yeah.-Yeah.What
are you doing here?

34:34.969 --> 34:36.139
What do you mean,what am I doing here?

34:36.219 --> 34:38.380
Frankie said they towed your
car away and you needed a lift.

34:38.469 --> 34:40.840
Hey,he's gonna make his
first big arrest,you know.

34:40.940 --> 34:41.790
Yeah,I know.That's great.That's great.

34:41.870 --> 34:43.270
I know.

34:43.350 --> 34:46.699
Listen,um,daddy,how come you never asked
me to be a part of rizzoli and sons?

34:46.780 --> 34:47.679
Well,now you want to be a plumber?

34:47.770 --> 34:49.130
No -- no,I
just --

34:49.190 --> 34:52.219
I don't understand why all of a sudden you
want frankie to take over the family business.

34:52.320 --> 34:53.500
Frankie jr.?!

34:53.560 --> 34:56.580
You two kids were never
interested in the business.

34:56.650 --> 34:58.750
- Are you all right?
- Yeah,yeah,yeah,I'm fine.I'm fine.

34:58.820 --> 35:01.390
- All right,I'll see you at home.
- Okay.Love you.

35:01.490 --> 35:04.250
all right,guys,way to go!

35:22.360 --> 35:24.420
I heard.I'm sorry.

35:27.550 --> 35:34.550
You should have seen him,grant and
his task force,everybody celebrating --

35:34.870 --> 35:36.220
It was a joke.

35:38.770 --> 35:41.840
Just -- we get one body
dropped in our laps.

35:41.970 --> 35:43.820
We have two stranglings in one day.

35:43.900 --> 35:46.940
We have no forensic
evidence,and then -- bam!

35:47.000 --> 35:49.380
We find blood.

35:49.440 --> 35:55.560
Maura says forensic evidence doesn't waver,it
doesn't lie,it doesn't change its mind.

36:01.260 --> 36:05.500
Hey,frost,did redmond jones have any
blood work recently,any doctor visits?

36:05.560 --> 36:08.390
no,Not that I could find.

36:12.140 --> 36:13.980
I'm gonna check something.

36:19.100 --> 36:21.410
he's sharing a cell with
this guy redmond jones.

36:21.500 --> 36:25.740
Well,redmond jones tells him the whole
story,all these girls that he strangled.

36:25.780 --> 36:30.640
Desalvo's such a nutcake,he begins telling
people it's him,the boston strangler's him.

36:32.480 --> 36:33.940
Excuse me.Detective leahy?

36:34.050 --> 36:36.170
You're,uh,Dr.Isles.

36:36.250 --> 36:37.820
I am.It's -- It's
nice to meet you.

36:37.870 --> 36:39.350
How are you?Good.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.320
Do you have a minute?

36:44.450 --> 36:46.750
Why?What's up,doc?

36:49.240 --> 36:52.020
Go to the one on boylston
street,across from the common.

36:52.420 --> 36:54.350
There's a dialysis center there.

36:54.430 --> 36:55.760
Yesterday,2:00.

36:55.830 --> 36:59.470
I checked the clearance records.Showed
kenny's photo around.The alibi's solid.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.050
I can't explain it.It's a gut thing.

37:01.090 --> 37:02.270
Understood.

37:02.310 --> 37:05.070
Freeze.Blow that up.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.480
There he is going in.

37:06.540 --> 37:08.710
Shuttle forward.

37:09.690 --> 37:11.220
Stop.

37:11.290 --> 37:13.310
Blow that up.

37:13.830 --> 37:15.510
Five minutes later.

37:15.740 --> 37:18.140
How long does dialysis take?

37:18.210 --> 37:19.940
Couple hours.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.240
That is a good alibi.

37:27.370 --> 37:29.400
How many dialysis
appointments have you missed?

37:29.460 --> 37:33.770
None.Every other day,i'm
in dialysis for hours.

37:33.900 --> 37:35.950
I don't think that's possible.

37:36.010 --> 37:38.320
You're exhibiting
signs of renal failure.

37:38.390 --> 37:40.420
I'm gonna go call your doctor.

37:41.070 --> 37:42.560
Hey,doc.

37:44.170 --> 37:45.440
What are you doing?

37:45.550 --> 37:48.450
You can't stop talking,can you?

37:52.520 --> 37:53.800
Do you know why you did it,detective?

37:53.860 --> 37:56.750
Yeah,I was in a bad mood,okay?

37:56.830 --> 37:58.370
You have an obsession disorder.

37:58.450 --> 38:01.540
You identified with the aggressor,the
boston strangler,and you became him.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.900
- Shut up.-Just --
'cause I can get help

38:02.940 --> 38:04.990
Shut up!

38:05.290 --> 38:08.040
The real killer is redmond
jones.You understand me?

38:08.100 --> 38:10.440
Redmond jones is the boston strangler.

38:10.520 --> 38:12.630
He's getting what he should
have gotten 40 years ago.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.060
I made sure of that.

38:14.120 --> 38:17.770
By murdering three more
women and framing him.

38:17.820 --> 38:19.300
hey,maura.

38:19.410 --> 38:21.900
Check it out.Can you run this...

38:21.960 --> 38:23.760
Blood.

38:23.830 --> 38:26.210
You are a good cop.

38:26.370 --> 38:29.300
- For a girl.
- All right,your gun Put it down.

38:29.390 --> 38:30.570
- Kick it over there.
- Don't do it,jane.

38:30.610 --> 38:33.650
Oh,shut the hell up!

38:35.310 --> 38:37.480
Put the gun down.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.510
Put it down.Slow.

38:42.650 --> 38:45.370
All right,now kick it over there.

38:46.910 --> 38:50.170
You planted redmond
jones' blood,didn't you?

38:50.280 --> 38:51.770
I still got some.

39:01.150 --> 39:02.630
Home run.

39:02.850 --> 39:04.590
No.Just a base hit.

39:09.450 --> 39:12.720
- You okay?
- Yeah.Yeah.

39:24.770 --> 39:27.530
Hey,did you ever talk to marfan man?

39:29.170 --> 39:31.300
He called to thank me.

39:31.430 --> 39:35.670
He found a specialist -- An
international expert,actually.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.980
Really?Are you gonna see him again?

39:38.700 --> 39:40.980
I don't date patients.

39:41.190 --> 39:44.470
You don't want to go out with him
'cause he's got some weird-ass disease.

39:45.360 --> 39:46.950
- His limbs are a little spidery.
- Come on.

39:47.030 --> 39:48.500
But that is not the only reason.

39:48.580 --> 39:50.040
Come on.

39:50.120 --> 39:52.600
You got to stop that.You got
to stop diagnosing people.

39:53.560 --> 39:56.010
Can we just talk about your love life.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.910
I... Okay.

39:58.060 --> 40:02.070
Um...i date two kinds -- The
kind that hates that I'm a cop.

40:02.150 --> 40:04.890
And the kind that wants
me to use the handcuffs.

40:05.360 --> 40:07.200
Okay,watch this.Ready?

40:07.280 --> 40:09.800
3,2,1.

40:10.280 --> 40:13.050
Shabow.

40:13.150 --> 40:14.570
See ya.

40:14.660 --> 40:16.740
That was fast.

40:16.870 --> 40:20.110
hi."i'm smiling. I like
handcuffs."All right.

40:20.350 --> 40:22.600
see?

40:24.120 --> 40:27.280
So...who do you think the
original boston strangler was?

40:27.360 --> 40:29.480
I don't think we'll ever know.

40:30.650 --> 40:32.690
Oh,yay.

40:32.810 --> 40:35.090
Good job,rizzoli.

40:35.330 --> 40:38.270
Yeah,uh... While kenny was
trying to kill Dr.Oz over here,

40:38.330 --> 40:41.100
I was looking for you so you
could have that arrest,too.

40:41.160 --> 40:43.280
Yeah.

40:45.960 --> 40:48.640
I owe you a massive apology.

40:48.810 --> 40:50.850
And...i'm sorry.

40:50.950 --> 40:54.060
Yeah,I can tell from the
nasty face you're making.

40:54.320 --> 40:55.930
Oh,that's not because of you,jane.

40:56.010 --> 40:57.950
He has bullous lesions.

40:57.990 --> 41:00.030
- I have what?
- Blisters.

41:00.150 --> 41:02.250
How did you know that?

41:02.330 --> 41:05.160
- You were limping.
- Right.I was limping.

41:05.190 --> 41:06.600
Can I sit down?

41:06.660 --> 41:07.990
- no.
- yes.

41:14.790 --> 41:17.610
We didn't have to wear
big-boy shoes in the drug unit.

41:17.700 --> 41:19.690
You're not gonna take those off in here?

41:20.300 --> 41:22.460
No.I'm not.

41:22.520 --> 41:24.440
Well,I can take a look at your bullous
lesions if you would like me to.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.160
- Maura,come on!
- Would you?

41:26.660 --> 41:28.990
- I'm just saying.
- thank you

41:31.010 --> 41:36.230
Anyway,I just wanted to saythat I'm sorry we
got off to such a bad start on our first case.

41:37.860 --> 41:40.580
And I wasn't cheating off
you on our catechism test.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.530
I saw you looking at it.

41:42.580 --> 41:46.330
You saw me looking,but I
wasn't looking at your paper.

41:49.850 --> 41:51.860
See you soon.

41:57.940 --> 41:59.680
Oh,shut up.
