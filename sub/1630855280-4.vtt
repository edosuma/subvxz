WEBVTT

00:16.478 --> 00:20.607
I was dreamin' of the past

00:22.150 --> 00:26.988
And my heart was beating fast

00:27.656 --> 00:30.575
I began to lose control

00:33.161 --> 00:38.500
I began to lose control

00:38.583 --> 00:42.587
I didn't mean to hurt you

00:43.838 --> 00:49.761
I'm sorry that I made you cry

00:49.845 --> 00:54.474
I didn't mean to hurt you

00:55.099 --> 00:58.728
I'm just a jealous guy

01:00.730 --> 01:04.860
I was feelin' insecure

01:06.069 --> 01:11.074
You might not love me anymore

01:11.782 --> 01:15.412
I was shiverin' inside

01:17.289 --> 01:20.876
I was shiverin' inside

01:38.977 --> 01:43.023
I'm just a jealous guy

01:51.114 --> 01:55.535
Jealous guy

01:56.536 --> 01:59.498
Jealous guy

01:59.998 --> 02:01.958
Jealous guy

02:02.250 --> 02:05.921
Jealous guy

02:06.630 --> 02:08.423
I didn't mean...

02:23.188 --> 02:27.192
I'm just a jealous guy

02:33.615 --> 02:36.535
You were right about this guy.
He's a bad muthafucka.

02:37.369 --> 02:40.414
-How bad?
-Bad to the fuckin' bone.

02:40.497 --> 02:41.915
Great.

02:42.290 --> 02:46.211
His name is Mauricio Costello Jackson.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.756
-What is he, Italian?
-Nah, he's not Italian.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.968
He's got ghetto-ass parents
that thought that was suave or some shit.

02:53.051 --> 02:56.471
That's beside the point.
2012, he got arrested.

02:56.555 --> 02:59.307
This motherfucker
kidnapped his ex-girlfriend,

02:59.391 --> 03:03.520
held her hostage for three days,
and beat the living shit out of her.

03:03.603 --> 03:05.188
-Oh, come on.
-I'm talkin' about torture.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.691
-Crazy, wild shit. Tortured her.
-He fucking tortured--

03:07.774 --> 03:11.027
There is a 400-page trial transcript

03:11.111 --> 03:14.948
with details that will raise the hair
off of your motherfuckin' neck.

03:15.031 --> 03:16.408
And to make matters worse,

03:16.491 --> 03:20.454
while he was in trial,
more shit came up.

03:20.537 --> 03:22.998
He got hit with a slew of other charges.

03:23.832 --> 03:27.627
God, D.
How the fuck did she let this guy in?

03:27.711 --> 03:30.630
I have no fuckin' clue.
I thought she only fucked white boys.

03:30.714 --> 03:35.135
So, 8 A.M. to 10 A.M. is training

03:35.218 --> 03:40.223
and then 10:30 A.M.
is a big concert update call.

03:40.724 --> 03:42.184
Yeah, that will be--

03:42.267 --> 03:45.145
-Yeah, the call is at 10:30.
-You can cancel that.

03:45.228 --> 03:48.064
Well, that's a big call.

03:48.148 --> 03:49.733
Andrew Finkelstein is on that call.

03:49.816 --> 03:51.526
-Who?
-Andrew Finkelstein.

03:51.610 --> 03:53.320
Like, he's an industry legend.

03:53.403 --> 03:55.614
I don't give a fuck who's on the call.
Cancel that.

03:57.365 --> 04:02.621
Okay, Dr. Sugarman is at 1 P.M.,

04:02.704 --> 04:05.749
-and then at 2 P.M., we have--
-Not 1 P.M. Cancel that.

04:07.667 --> 04:08.877
Mike Dean's coming.

04:24.059 --> 04:25.852
Motherfuckin' Mike Dean.

04:25.936 --> 04:27.354
-In the flesh.
-What's up, what's up?

04:28.105 --> 04:29.689
What'd I tell you, huh?

04:29.773 --> 04:31.108
-It's alright, it's alright.
-"It's alright"?

04:31.191 --> 04:33.193
-That's fuckin' funny.
-Yeah. Hell yeah.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.614
What, are you checkin'
for acoustics or somethin'?

04:37.697 --> 04:39.449
Yeah, we gotta find the right place.

04:45.872 --> 04:48.708
Nah, this is way too echoey. C'mon.

04:50.168 --> 04:52.379
Beautiful house,
but the acoustics are garbage.

04:52.462 --> 04:55.799
2 P.M., we have a Half Magic meeting
here at the house.

04:55.882 --> 04:59.177
-What's that?
-That's me and Joss's makeup line.

04:59.261 --> 05:00.637
You collaborate together?

05:00.720 --> 05:05.308
Yeah, well, we've been
working on it for a really long time

05:05.392 --> 05:07.644
and I'm sure Joss has told you about it

05:07.727 --> 05:10.605
'cause I'm not really
just an assistant to her, like--

05:10.689 --> 05:12.691
-Cancel it.
-I don't know if you understand

05:12.774 --> 05:14.317
because this is, like, an important--

05:14.401 --> 05:16.319
It's more important for you,

05:16.403 --> 05:20.407
but we're working for Jocelyn
so cancel it.

05:32.252 --> 05:33.545
Yeah, this is it.

05:44.681 --> 05:46.767
-What's up, what's up?
-I wanna introduce you to Jocelyn.

05:46.850 --> 05:48.101
-Hi.
-Jocelyn, Mike.

05:48.185 --> 05:49.394
-Hi. How you doing?
-Hi. We actually met before

05:49.478 --> 05:50.645
at the Grammys,
but you probably don't remember.

05:50.729 --> 05:52.189
-What's up? How you doin'?
-Nice to see you.

05:52.272 --> 05:54.065
I'm really excited to be working with you.

05:54.149 --> 05:55.942
We were messing with this thing
on the piano that's like

05:56.026 --> 05:58.862
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

05:59.529 --> 06:02.157
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

06:13.085 --> 06:14.711
There you go. Alright now.

06:15.462 --> 06:16.963
There we go.

06:18.590 --> 06:20.634
On my own

06:20.717 --> 06:23.428
I like not having to make
decisions for myself.

06:23.512 --> 06:24.554
Why?

06:25.472 --> 06:27.140
Because I trust you.

06:28.350 --> 06:30.519
You should make that
the opening lyric to the song.

06:32.062 --> 06:35.190
I don't wanna decide things for myself

06:35.273 --> 06:37.317
On my own

06:38.985 --> 06:41.196
So, you don't wanna decide
things on your own?

06:41.279 --> 06:42.239
No?

06:43.156 --> 06:44.241
I can help you out,

06:44.324 --> 06:46.326
but it's gotta be your decision
at the end of the day.

06:46.410 --> 06:51.081
Finally, for the first time, I'm alone

06:53.625 --> 06:54.709
Keep writing.

06:57.754 --> 06:58.839
Leia, if you're gonna work for me,

06:58.922 --> 07:00.841
you're gonna have to grow
a bigger set of balls.

07:02.217 --> 07:03.343
You understand what I'm saying?

07:04.553 --> 07:06.179
You're going soft.

07:06.596 --> 07:07.597
I'm not.

07:08.056 --> 07:09.850
We're here for Jocelyn, right?

07:09.933 --> 07:12.811
I definitely am.
I am absolutely here for Jocelyn.

07:12.894 --> 07:14.896
-Okay.
-I know that I am.

07:22.195 --> 07:25.782
I don't wanna decide things for myself

07:25.866 --> 07:27.868
On my own

07:28.869 --> 07:33.874
Finally, for the first time, I'm alone

07:34.624 --> 07:38.336
And you got me havin'
good times with a bad boy

07:38.420 --> 07:41.590
Seems I've got a choice to make

07:41.673 --> 07:46.386
Be my voice
and I choose you to fill the void

07:46.470 --> 07:47.846
There ya go.

07:53.101 --> 07:55.395
Listen, I know you not askin'
for my advice or nothin',

07:55.479 --> 07:57.773
but can I make a suggestion?

07:59.483 --> 08:00.817
Please.

08:03.612 --> 08:06.031
I think we should kill this motherfucker.

08:14.456 --> 08:16.083
No.

08:16.166 --> 08:17.334
Whatchu mean no?

08:17.417 --> 08:18.919
We're not killin' anybody, D.

08:19.002 --> 08:21.505
Why not? You gettin' fuckin' soft?

08:21.588 --> 08:23.465
Don't be no fuckin' pussy,
Chaimy, come on!

08:23.548 --> 08:24.716
D.

08:29.471 --> 08:31.014
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

08:33.767 --> 08:37.395
You go to the house,
you be the eyes and ears, all right?

08:37.479 --> 08:40.899
Fuckfaces like this
always have a weak spot.

08:40.982 --> 08:44.486
Let me know every detail.
Okay? I don't care how small.

08:44.569 --> 08:46.822
-But what you gonna do?
-I don't know.

08:47.906 --> 08:49.908
But I'll fuckin' figure it out.

08:51.368 --> 08:52.661
Yeah.

08:57.165 --> 08:58.166
F--

09:00.460 --> 09:01.628
-Okay, Chaimy?
-What?

09:01.711 --> 09:03.755
Yeah. Black Panther has landed.

09:03.839 --> 09:05.424
All right, now, listen,
this is what you wanna do.

09:05.507 --> 09:07.717
-Yeah?
-Do not text me, all right?

09:07.801 --> 09:10.846
And I'm not gon' text you neither
because I do not want a paper trail.

09:10.929 --> 09:12.764
If somethin' goes down,
I'ma keep you abreast

09:12.848 --> 09:15.434
by calling you on the phone, all right?
Please don't text me.

09:15.517 --> 09:17.477
-All right.
-Okay. All right. Bet.

09:23.692 --> 09:24.901
Hi.

09:26.570 --> 09:27.821
I'm Chloe.

09:29.823 --> 09:31.032
Hey, Chloe.

09:31.575 --> 09:34.870
-I'm Destiny.
-Oh, my God!

09:39.207 --> 09:40.625
All right, all right.

09:40.709 --> 09:43.420
Destiny is my favorite name.

09:44.838 --> 09:45.839
Okay, cool.

09:45.922 --> 09:47.716
So, what you do here, Chloe?

09:48.175 --> 09:49.718
Well, I just hang out.

09:50.469 --> 09:51.803
Play the piano.

09:51.887 --> 09:53.096
Oh, yeah?

09:53.638 --> 09:55.098
Can I hear it?

09:55.182 --> 10:00.854
I've been a crocodile my whole life

10:00.937 --> 10:04.316
I just figured it out for myself

10:04.399 --> 10:08.820
Everyone telling me didn't help

10:08.904 --> 10:10.906
How

10:12.032 --> 10:15.660
Could you tell me to be different

10:18.455 --> 10:20.582
I choose you to fill me

10:20.665 --> 10:22.042
You tell me

10:22.125 --> 10:24.503
Lies

10:24.586 --> 10:25.629
Be my voice

10:25.712 --> 10:29.299
And I'll choose you to fill the void

10:31.968 --> 10:34.679
-Hi. Hey.
-Hey.

10:34.763 --> 10:37.432
Whoa

10:37.516 --> 10:39.518
I'm crying alone

10:39.601 --> 10:42.270
Yeah, so your tongue wants to retreat.

10:42.354 --> 10:43.730
So, that's why it's covered.

10:43.814 --> 10:45.607
Ooh-ooh-ooh

10:45.690 --> 10:46.650
But you want it out.

10:46.733 --> 10:51.029
Ooh, whoa

10:51.113 --> 10:53.824
And then let it spin with the vibrato.

10:53.907 --> 10:57.536
I'm crying

10:57.619 --> 10:59.663
Yeah, I, I, I.

10:59.746 --> 11:03.708
Alone

11:03.792 --> 11:06.044
I'm crying alone

11:06.128 --> 11:07.212
Yeah.

11:08.380 --> 11:14.344
The lonely crocodile weeps alone

11:14.428 --> 11:18.682
In the Nile, alone in the Nile

11:19.307 --> 11:20.976
Riff in that space for a little bit.

11:21.059 --> 11:25.105
Alone

11:25.188 --> 11:26.398
There you go, Chloe.

11:26.481 --> 11:28.400
Yo, everyone,
shut the fuck up for, like, two seconds.

11:28.483 --> 11:29.860
Two seconds.

11:31.445 --> 11:32.279
Leia.

11:34.448 --> 11:35.824
Shut the fuck up!

11:36.283 --> 11:37.659
I'm tryna hear it!

11:38.827 --> 11:41.079
That's why you guys came,
right, to hear the song?

11:43.498 --> 11:44.916
What the fuck was that?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.085
-Here we go.
-That's not the song.

11:47.169 --> 11:49.379
-We're starting at the verse, too, right?
-Yes.

11:51.673 --> 11:53.675
I choose you to fill me

11:53.759 --> 11:55.594
You to tell me...

11:55.677 --> 11:58.346
It's good, right? It's fuckin' hard!

11:58.430 --> 12:01.141
-So, how do you know Jocelyn?
-I'm her manager.

12:01.767 --> 12:03.310
I thought Tedros was.

12:04.603 --> 12:08.648
-How do you know Tedros?
-He saved my life.

12:09.107 --> 12:12.569
-How?
-Well, I was living on the streets.

12:14.154 --> 12:16.364
I was a heroin addict

12:18.658 --> 12:21.036
And Tedros just saw me.

12:21.119 --> 12:24.122
And he put his hand out

12:24.206 --> 12:30.253
And he saved my life forever

12:30.337 --> 12:35.509
And gave me a place to lay my head, oh

12:35.592 --> 12:37.177
Somethin' like that.

12:38.553 --> 12:41.139
-Yeah.
-So, where do you sleep now, Chloe?

12:41.223 --> 12:42.933
-Here.
-Yeah?

12:43.016 --> 12:45.185
Sometimes I do miss the club.

12:45.936 --> 12:47.270
So you sleep at the club?

12:47.354 --> 12:49.898
-No, here.
-Right. Sorry.

12:49.981 --> 12:51.817
You used to sleep at the club.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.111
Have you ever been to the club?

12:54.194 --> 12:55.362
No.

12:55.987 --> 12:59.241
But, Chloe,
do you think if I wanted to sleep there

12:59.324 --> 13:00.200
that I could?

13:00.283 --> 13:02.327
Yeah,
but you should just stay here with us.

13:03.078 --> 13:05.997
Thank you.
That was very nice of you.

13:07.165 --> 13:10.627
-How old are you, Chloe?
-Sev-- Er, 18.

13:15.966 --> 13:18.760
I have to pee, but I'm afraid to--

13:18.844 --> 13:21.012
Leia, please, just for, like,
for, like, a minute.

13:21.096 --> 13:23.348
Just one minute. Just one.

13:23.432 --> 13:25.475
-Right? Just-- It's Joss.
-Yeah.

13:25.559 --> 13:27.853
-No, no. I know. I heard--
-Shut the fuck up, Leia.

13:27.936 --> 13:29.271
Wanna go to the bathroom?
Is that what you said?

13:29.354 --> 13:30.397
-I was just gonna go--
-We're listening.

13:30.480 --> 13:31.690
I was just gonna go to the bathroom.

13:32.691 --> 13:33.567
You can go to the bathroom.

13:35.402 --> 13:37.446
We'll wait for you.
We'll wait, we'll wait for you.

13:37.529 --> 13:39.614
-We'll be-- complete silence--
-Just go after.

13:39.698 --> 13:41.658
Till you're out the bathroom.
We'll just wait for Leia.

13:41.742 --> 13:43.118
-She can go after.
-Let her go to the bathroom.

13:43.201 --> 13:45.036
We'll wait. Three minutes?
We'll wait for three minutes.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.079
Silence. No one talking.

13:46.163 --> 13:48.165
-You can wait--
-I can wait. We can just play the song.

13:48.248 --> 13:49.833
Leia. Shut the fuck up, Leia!

13:50.792 --> 13:52.169
Stop. I was talking to her.

13:52.252 --> 13:54.755
She was just responding.
Baby, it's okay.

13:55.005 --> 13:56.757
You're very talented, Chloe.

13:58.091 --> 13:59.509
I like talking to you.

13:59.593 --> 14:01.720
I like talkin' to you, too.

14:03.138 --> 14:05.140
You know what they call people like you?

14:05.724 --> 14:07.142
Crocodiles?

14:07.642 --> 14:09.352
Pure hearts.

14:10.187 --> 14:11.229
You're real.

14:11.313 --> 14:15.233
This business is a crazy,
corrupt fuckin' place.

14:15.317 --> 14:17.110
-How you been? Good?
-Good, man.

14:17.194 --> 14:18.862
-Good to see you.
-Oh, we should play the--

14:18.945 --> 14:20.030
We should play it.

14:20.113 --> 14:21.323
Okay! That's what's up. Yeah.

14:23.075 --> 14:26.495
I don't wanna decide things for myself

14:26.578 --> 14:28.914
On my own

14:29.539 --> 14:34.252
Finally, for the first time, I'm alone

14:37.172 --> 14:40.801
Don't let nothing--
Do you hear me?

14:41.718 --> 14:44.346
No one or anything

14:44.763 --> 14:46.765
get in the way of your gift.

14:47.682 --> 14:50.685
'Cause it is pure and it is beautiful.

14:52.062 --> 14:53.730
Hi, Dyanne. I'm Natalie.

14:53.814 --> 14:54.689
-Hi, I'm Dyanne.
-It's nice to meet you.

14:54.773 --> 14:55.857
They're ready for you

14:55.941 --> 14:57.109
if you'd like to follow me this way.
-Thank you.

14:57.192 --> 14:59.486
-Hope you weren't waiting too long.
-No, it's fine.

15:06.118 --> 15:08.870
And the moment that voice
gets out to the world,

15:08.954 --> 15:11.915
there'll be a lotta people
that's gonna wanna take it.

15:13.917 --> 15:15.544
But you can't let 'em

15:16.461 --> 15:17.921
'cause what you got is special.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.005
Oh, look. Here she is.

15:19.089 --> 15:20.632
-Here she is, guys.
-Good luck.

15:20.715 --> 15:22.008
-Dyanne.
-Hi.

15:22.092 --> 15:24.136
Hi, everyone.

15:24.219 --> 15:26.263
We're so happy to have you here.

15:26.346 --> 15:30.767
Sit right there. Perfect.
That's your spot today.

15:30.851 --> 15:33.019
Welcome. Welcome to Magistrate Records.

15:33.103 --> 15:35.230
-Thank you for having me here.
-Of course.

15:35.313 --> 15:39.735
You stay true to that crocodile song.
'Cause that's you.

15:40.819 --> 15:42.279
Stay observant.

15:43.697 --> 15:45.532
If it feels wrong, it's wrong.

15:47.826 --> 15:49.161
Okay?

15:50.287 --> 15:51.913
Promise me.

15:52.956 --> 15:55.167
Yeah, I promise.

16:02.549 --> 16:03.550
What do you think?

16:03.633 --> 16:06.178
It's dope. Don't get me wrong, it is dope.

16:06.261 --> 16:08.180
The beginning part, you know, you're like,

16:08.263 --> 16:10.891
Duh-nuh, fill the void

16:10.974 --> 16:13.018
-"Yeah."
-Yeah.

16:13.643 --> 16:15.437
That's exactly what it sound like. "Yeah."

16:15.520 --> 16:16.897
-Yeah.
-Kinda feels like exactly what you did.

16:16.980 --> 16:17.981
Like a shrug. Like, "Yeah."

16:18.064 --> 16:19.816
Yeah, it's like anticlimactic.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.610
Yes! Go there, be raw with this.
You know what I'm saying?

16:21.693 --> 16:23.737
-Go there. Go all the way there--
-Yo, D, D...

16:24.488 --> 16:25.864
I got just the trick.

16:34.206 --> 16:35.248
Come here.

16:48.345 --> 16:50.055
Will you double-knot it?

16:53.016 --> 16:55.352
It's just me. Okay?

16:55.977 --> 16:57.646
I want you to block out the world.

16:58.355 --> 16:59.981
Get the fuck outta your own head.

17:01.608 --> 17:03.610
I want you at the edge of cumming.

17:04.236 --> 17:05.404
Okay, baby?

17:05.487 --> 17:06.947
-Okay.
-Take your time.

17:08.031 --> 17:11.243
I want you to breathe.
There's nobody here.

17:13.787 --> 17:14.746
There's nobody here.

17:15.622 --> 17:17.707
What turns you on is gonna turn them on.

17:17.791 --> 17:20.085
You know this. It needs to be real.

17:21.044 --> 17:22.712
Or they'll feel that it's fake.

17:24.047 --> 17:25.799
Do you understand what I'm saying?

17:25.882 --> 17:28.135
-Yes.
-Do you understand, baby?

17:28.218 --> 17:29.428
-Yes.
-Do you feel it?

17:29.511 --> 17:30.512
Yes.

17:37.769 --> 17:39.479
Now sing.

17:41.231 --> 17:45.569
I choose you to fill the void, yeah

17:53.910 --> 17:57.289
I choose you to fill the void

17:57.372 --> 17:58.874
Yeah

18:01.918 --> 18:04.629
I choose you to fill the void

18:06.590 --> 18:11.052
I choose you to fill the void, yeah

18:15.223 --> 18:17.434
...you to tell me

18:19.227 --> 18:23.815
I choose you to fill the void, yeah

18:25.776 --> 18:28.987
I choose you to fill the void

18:32.324 --> 18:35.118
...fill the void, yeah

18:35.202 --> 18:38.830
Yeah! Yeah!

18:54.221 --> 18:55.138
Yeah!

18:56.056 --> 18:58.225
Yeah! Yeah!

18:58.767 --> 19:03.063
Chaimy? There is some
kinky-ass shit in this house.

19:03.146 --> 19:05.315
This shit is weird, scary shit.

19:05.398 --> 19:07.192
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:07.275 --> 19:12.531
And Jocelyn's on some weird-ass
fuckin' S&M shit with this dude?

19:12.614 --> 19:13.615
Shit is wild.

19:13.698 --> 19:14.991
Honestly, I just think it's

19:15.075 --> 19:17.619
really fucked up that
we're all just sitting around

19:17.702 --> 19:19.538
watching Jocelyn get assaulted.

19:20.997 --> 19:22.165
Assaulted?

19:22.833 --> 19:26.753
Yeah.
And no one is saying anything.

19:26.837 --> 19:28.964
Like, Destiny isn't saying anything.

19:29.047 --> 19:30.715
I don't know where Chaim is.

19:30.799 --> 19:34.177
Like, they're all letting
this psychopath exploit her

19:34.261 --> 19:38.181
beca-- Sorry, but he is.

19:38.265 --> 19:40.642
Just so that they can make money?

19:40.725 --> 19:44.980
Like, all of these people say
that it's their job to take care of her,

19:45.063 --> 19:47.441
but they don't really care.

19:47.524 --> 19:51.528
Okay. I know his methods
could seem odd to outsiders,

19:51.611 --> 19:54.072
but it's his process.

19:56.616 --> 19:57.784
And it works.

19:58.577 --> 20:03.248
Yeah. I think that it's great,
but I don't think that it's, like--

20:03.331 --> 20:04.666
I don't think it's worth it.

20:05.125 --> 20:08.879
You know, Tedros always says there's
two types of people:

20:08.962 --> 20:12.591
the ones that support you
and the ones that are obstacles.

20:13.550 --> 20:16.762
-So, am I one of the obstacles?
-Are you?

20:17.846 --> 20:20.599
Honestly, Izaak,
I'm just really scared for her right now.

20:20.682 --> 20:23.018
He's doing mind control
on her or something--

20:23.101 --> 20:24.770
-Mind control?
-Yeah! He's, like,

20:24.853 --> 20:27.981
using her in front of other people
like she's not even a human being.

20:28.064 --> 20:30.317
Well, she's not a human being.

20:33.445 --> 20:34.780
She's a star.

20:35.489 --> 20:37.449
And stars belong to the world.

20:39.618 --> 20:41.495
Okay, now, listen,
I've been here about a week now.

20:41.578 --> 20:43.747
Let me just break it down to you, alright?

20:43.830 --> 20:47.250
There's about three to five kids in here,
crazy talented.

20:47.334 --> 20:48.960
What did you do to me?

20:49.044 --> 20:51.088
What did you do to me?

20:51.171 --> 20:53.840
I put something in your drink

20:53.924 --> 20:56.009
I put something in your drink

20:56.093 --> 20:58.720
What did you do to me?

20:58.804 --> 21:00.347
What did you do to me?

21:00.806 --> 21:03.850
I put something in your drink

21:03.934 --> 21:05.644
Beautiful.

21:05.727 --> 21:08.563
And what's wild is they all each
have their own sound.

21:08.647 --> 21:10.232
It's okay now

21:10.315 --> 21:13.860
You have to let him make you cry

21:13.944 --> 21:17.572
I know you're scared

21:17.656 --> 21:20.409
Like a god in the sky watching over...

21:20.492 --> 21:22.077
They got this little girl over here,

21:22.160 --> 21:23.787
and she writes these crazy lyrics.

21:23.870 --> 21:25.414
They're like poetry, like poems.

21:25.497 --> 21:27.374
Like, if you really stop
and listen and stuff,

21:27.457 --> 21:29.334
it's like you wanna give your life to God.

21:29.418 --> 21:31.336
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

21:31.420 --> 21:35.298
Like a god

21:38.301 --> 21:40.470
There's this African-American man.

21:40.554 --> 21:42.848
You don't get it no more

21:42.931 --> 21:44.474
Oh

21:44.558 --> 21:47.686
Don't, ay

21:47.769 --> 21:50.981
He sings like an angel.

21:51.064 --> 21:54.776
And, no, you won't get before

21:57.070 --> 22:00.198
Whatever that "Tough Love" was,
that was good.

22:00.282 --> 22:03.702
Give me your love, tough love

22:03.785 --> 22:05.871
-Yeah, I love it, I love it. Love it.
-You do?

22:06.580 --> 22:08.623
So what's going on with this Tedros guy?

22:09.040 --> 22:11.084
Listen, Tedros is Tedros.

22:13.128 --> 22:14.796
Tough love

22:14.880 --> 22:15.964
Then next.

22:16.047 --> 22:17.215
Give me your love

22:17.299 --> 22:18.800
I'm not even trying to change that man.

22:18.884 --> 22:21.094
All I'm doin' is observing.
You know what I mean?

22:21.178 --> 22:23.430
I wanna watch him and see how he moves,

22:23.513 --> 22:25.265
so I know how to manage.

22:27.017 --> 22:28.101
Give me your love

22:28.185 --> 22:31.521
And how about Jocelyn?
Is he really getting hits out of her?

22:32.647 --> 22:36.735
Yeah, he's really working on crafting
something specific with her.

22:36.818 --> 22:38.987
Fishbowl, chokehold

22:40.030 --> 22:42.532
-What's funny? What's funny?
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

22:42.616 --> 22:43.950
I was laughing at something else.

22:46.119 --> 22:47.287
But...

22:47.370 --> 22:48.705
But?

22:48.789 --> 22:51.166
What he does to get it...

22:51.249 --> 22:52.250
That's what you told me!

22:52.334 --> 22:53.668
You said it. She said it.

22:53.752 --> 22:55.796
Chaimy, I done seen some shit.

22:55.879 --> 22:57.464
And he does this thing where he...

22:57.547 --> 22:58.882
Keep pushing.

22:58.965 --> 23:01.927
...tests their limits,
and puts them in restraints and shit.

23:02.010 --> 23:03.470
What, like torture?

23:03.553 --> 23:05.222
Yes, yes.

23:05.305 --> 23:07.557
Puts them in, like, fuckin' chokeholds

23:07.641 --> 23:10.852
on some crazy wild shit,
ties them up and shit,

23:10.936 --> 23:13.480
and be like,
"Tell me the truth. Tell me your deep--

23:13.563 --> 23:16.608
Tell me your deepest, darkest secret."

23:16.691 --> 23:18.777
Dyanne, we don't do this.

23:18.860 --> 23:21.279
We don't just find people on the street

23:21.363 --> 23:24.408
and give them deals that will forever
alter the course of their life.

23:24.491 --> 23:27.202
In fact, I can't think of a single time
we've ever done this. Have we?

23:27.285 --> 23:29.079
-No.
-But what it is,

23:29.162 --> 23:31.790
is we see something in you. It's special.

23:31.873 --> 23:34.543
And it's not just your talent,
it's your work ethic.

23:34.626 --> 23:36.711
So, here's what we can offer you.

23:38.255 --> 23:41.091
We want your first song
to be "World Class Sinner."

23:41.174 --> 23:44.136
The couple of takes we did at the end
of the other day,

23:44.219 --> 23:47.013
that was all we needed
to convince everyone.

23:47.097 --> 23:49.099
So we just need to have you
record the vocals,

23:49.182 --> 23:50.851
and it's all yours.

23:50.934 --> 23:53.812
You will have access to every division

23:53.895 --> 23:56.356
and every person in every division
of our company.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.692
That means we oversee your record,

23:58.775 --> 24:02.195
we pair you with the top producers
in the industry,

24:02.279 --> 24:05.949
you'll have features
on all the major streaming platforms,

24:06.032 --> 24:09.286
bumps in the algorithm,
a full team of legal support at your back,

24:09.369 --> 24:15.375
merchandise: your face on t-shirts,
multi-million-dollar marketing campaigns,

24:15.459 --> 24:18.462
access to the best venues
across the globe.

24:18.545 --> 24:20.172
That means world tour.

24:20.922 --> 24:21.965
Hi. How are you?

24:22.048 --> 24:25.010
Good, good.
Last time I saw you,

24:25.093 --> 24:27.053
it seemed like you were
having a really tough time.

24:27.137 --> 24:28.305
How are you doing now?

24:28.388 --> 24:30.599
I'm good. I'm good. You know

24:31.641 --> 24:35.812
I think it's no secret that I lost my mom
fairly recently and

24:36.688 --> 24:38.523
you know, grief comes in waves.

24:38.607 --> 24:41.985
And you definitely caught me
in the middle of a big one.

24:42.069 --> 24:45.155
And I kind of wish
I had handled that day

24:45.655 --> 24:47.407
a little better but, you know,

24:47.491 --> 24:49.618
I'm just doing the best that I can.

24:49.701 --> 24:51.620
Absolutely,
I mean, you're only human, right?

24:53.288 --> 24:55.332
Yeah. It's funny,
I feel like people keep saying that to me

24:55.415 --> 24:57.000
as if I'm not.

24:57.501 --> 25:02.172
Love... is a losing game

25:03.882 --> 25:08.553
One I wish I... never played

25:10.263 --> 25:13.517
What a mess we made

25:14.935 --> 25:17.521
And now, the final frame

25:19.731 --> 25:23.735
Love... is a losing game

25:25.946 --> 25:28.490
Some of us have a friend

25:28.990 --> 25:32.119
Yeah. And how 'bout Nikki and Finkelstein?

25:32.202 --> 25:34.079
Are they concerned about the tour?

25:35.622 --> 25:37.833
No, I don't think anybody's concerned
about the tour.

25:37.916 --> 25:41.253
I think it's always concerning
when somebody that you love

25:41.336 --> 25:44.214
is in a state of distress.

25:44.297 --> 25:46.716
But we are very much
moving forward with the tour.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.677
I did hear you calling out

25:48.760 --> 25:50.804
for your dead mother
during the music video shoot.

25:50.887 --> 25:52.597
Are you sure you can handle this?

25:55.600 --> 25:56.852
I just-- We can--

25:56.935 --> 25:58.603
I think we should move on
to the next subject.

26:00.147 --> 26:03.150
Love is a losing game

26:13.243 --> 26:16.246
And it was more than I could stand

26:18.790 --> 26:20.834
Know you're a gambling man

26:21.793 --> 26:23.545
And mar my mind

26:23.628 --> 26:25.714
Lo-love...

26:25.797 --> 26:26.882
Is a fate resigned

26:27.507 --> 26:30.177
Over futile odds

26:30.260 --> 26:31.219
-Boo.
-Fuck!

26:34.431 --> 26:35.974
Jesus fucking--

26:36.767 --> 26:40.187
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You should've seen your face.

26:40.270 --> 26:41.855
Oh, my God.
You looked like a little bitch.

26:41.938 --> 26:44.483
You scared the fucking shit out of me.

26:45.942 --> 26:47.903
-Oh, my God.
-What the fuck?

26:47.986 --> 26:49.654
What'd you think,
I was gonna butt fuck you?

26:52.449 --> 26:56.411
Oh, my God.
Hey, why don't you sing anymore?

26:57.120 --> 27:00.332
I don't know, man.
It's complicated.

27:00.874 --> 27:02.959
-Complicated?
-Yeah.

27:03.043 --> 27:04.753
Well, I heard you singin' in the shower.

27:04.836 --> 27:06.797
Wake the fuck up!

27:06.880 --> 27:09.424
-Come on, get up, ladies!
-Up! You heard the man!

27:09.508 --> 27:13.261
-Get the fuck up!
-Good morning! Get the fuck up! Get up!

27:13.345 --> 27:17.140
Get up, get up. Up, up, up, up, up, up.
Chloe, up.

27:17.641 --> 27:22.813
Xander, up. Line up right here.

27:27.442 --> 27:29.236
Take your hand off Charlie.

27:29.861 --> 27:31.029
Stand straight.

27:31.113 --> 27:34.950
Does anybody know the meaning
of the word "family"?

27:37.369 --> 27:39.079
It's not a child and its mother.

27:40.747 --> 27:42.707
No, that's "domus,"

27:42.791 --> 27:45.377
the root of the word "domestic."

27:46.128 --> 27:49.589
The root of the word
"family" is "famulus."

27:54.761 --> 27:57.389
"Famulus" means "servant."

27:57.472 --> 28:01.393
It is our duty to serve our family.

28:02.144 --> 28:03.562
Why don't you sing anymore?

28:08.233 --> 28:12.028
I tore my vocal cords couple years ago.

28:13.572 --> 28:15.574
Yeah, Jocelyn told me that.

28:17.409 --> 28:18.660
Interesting.

28:19.578 --> 28:22.956
But I was walking by your room
and I heard you sing

28:23.039 --> 28:24.666
and you sound great.

28:25.459 --> 28:29.004
So, you're either fully healed
or you're lying.

28:32.966 --> 28:34.760
What else did Jocelyn tell you?

28:36.303 --> 28:38.263
That her mom outed you when you were 13

28:39.556 --> 28:41.099
and it crippled you.

28:44.895 --> 28:46.438
Then you left the show.

28:49.232 --> 28:52.903
And then you quit singing
because you had a "vocal injury."

28:54.613 --> 28:57.991
Despite all that,
you still moved in with her and her mom.

28:58.784 --> 29:02.496
Yeah, I didn't know that it was Julianne
until much later.

29:03.705 --> 29:05.373
Why don't you sing anymore?

29:07.542 --> 29:09.795
You should really use the gift
that God gave you.

29:14.841 --> 29:16.885
You ask Jocelyn how she feels about that?

29:17.886 --> 29:19.721
What does Jocelyn have to do with it?

29:21.389 --> 29:22.599
Well...

29:42.786 --> 29:45.747
Thank you, baby.
Go sit over there.

29:50.293 --> 29:51.920
Xander, step forward.

29:55.715 --> 29:56.716
What?

29:59.302 --> 30:00.929
Come forward.

30:03.223 --> 30:04.224
Why?

30:04.307 --> 30:05.559
Xander

30:16.737 --> 30:18.739
do you know why I use this?

30:20.782 --> 30:22.159
No.

30:22.242 --> 30:23.869
It's to unlock people.

30:24.578 --> 30:26.204
To find out what's in their heart.

30:28.248 --> 30:30.459
Tedros, can I talk to you for a second?

30:34.588 --> 30:36.256
I don't think he deserves this.

30:36.339 --> 30:38.008
Izaak, Izaak!

30:38.091 --> 30:39.885
Get the fuck back here, Xander!

30:39.968 --> 30:42.679
What the fuck are you doing?
Where the fuck is he going?

30:42.763 --> 30:43.930
He fucking betrayed you.

30:44.014 --> 30:46.600
Yeah, but this feels a little extreme.

30:46.683 --> 30:47.893
Extreme?

30:49.311 --> 30:50.854
You wanna know what's extreme?

30:51.605 --> 30:53.231
My servitude.

30:54.065 --> 30:56.610
My devotion to you.

30:57.569 --> 30:58.779
On Earth

30:59.863 --> 31:01.073
and in heaven.

31:02.199 --> 31:05.827
All you have to do
is tell me if he's lying.

31:06.828 --> 31:08.830
-Leave me the fuck alone.
-Shut the fuck up!

31:08.914 --> 31:10.332
-Let me go.
-Stop fucking moving

31:10.415 --> 31:12.417
or I'll throw you down the fucking stairs!

31:12.501 --> 31:15.087
-I'ma throw you down the fucking stairs!
-Leave me the fuck alone!

31:15.170 --> 31:16.671
-Bring him down here!
-Shut the fuck up!

31:16.755 --> 31:18.924
-Bring him down!
-Please!

31:19.007 --> 31:20.675
-I'll fucking cut your throat!
-Joss, what the fuck?

31:20.759 --> 31:22.552
-Shut up! Joss can't save you.
-Lay him down.

31:22.636 --> 31:24.596
Tie his fuckin' ass up.

31:24.679 --> 31:26.473
-Don't move.
-You're fucking hurting me.

31:26.556 --> 31:28.517
I don't give a fuck!
What do you think I'm here to do?

31:28.600 --> 31:30.602
-Fuck off!
-Stop fighting, Xander.

31:30.685 --> 31:32.979
-Stop fuckin' moving.
-Stop!

31:33.063 --> 31:34.272
-I can't breathe.
-Shut up!

31:34.356 --> 31:36.983
-Tedros, please.
-Are you gonna cooperate?

31:37.067 --> 31:39.194
-Please.
-Or is Mitch gonna have to take

31:39.277 --> 31:41.113
a fucking hammer to your fucking ankles?

31:41.196 --> 31:43.198
-Please don't fucking hurt me.
-Pull his fuckin' head up.

31:43.281 --> 31:45.367
Please. Chloe!

31:45.450 --> 31:46.326
Chloe can't save you.

31:46.410 --> 31:47.369
-What I say? Nobody--
-Chloe, please!

31:47.452 --> 31:49.037
-Chloe! Chloe!
-Xander, Xander,

31:49.121 --> 31:50.831
-shut the fuck up.
-Look at me, please get them to stop.

31:50.914 --> 31:53.583
-Stop struggling, Xander.
-Please, Tedros.

31:53.667 --> 31:55.627
-I like you.
-Fuck you.

31:55.710 --> 31:58.046
No, I do. I really do.

31:59.714 --> 32:00.841
I just don't trust you.

32:01.716 --> 32:03.135
I think you lie.

32:03.718 --> 32:05.303
I don't lie.

32:05.387 --> 32:06.847
Why didn't you tell anyone

32:06.930 --> 32:09.433
that her mother was humiliating her
and beating her?

32:09.516 --> 32:12.227
She asked me not to fucking tell anyone,
so I didn't.

32:12.310 --> 32:13.895
That's not fucking true, Xander.

32:13.979 --> 32:15.147
You fucking did.

32:18.734 --> 32:21.319
You told me that her mom made you
fuckin' sign a contract

32:21.403 --> 32:23.113
that you couldn't fucking sing ever again.

32:23.196 --> 32:25.198
-Did you not?
-Her mom didn't fucking like

32:25.282 --> 32:27.534
that I was a good singer or some shit,
so she fucking--

32:27.617 --> 32:28.910
Made you sign a fucking contract?

32:28.994 --> 32:30.787
-Yeah.
-What the fuck did you say?

32:30.871 --> 32:32.122
I said the fucking truth, Jocelyn.

32:32.205 --> 32:33.582
That's not fucking true, Xander!

32:33.665 --> 32:36.001
-Yes, it--
-What the fuck is wrong with you?

32:38.378 --> 32:42.007
Tedros, please don't shock me
for one second, okay? Please.

32:42.090 --> 32:46.094
You don't understand the fucking years
that this bitch has taken from me,

32:46.178 --> 32:47.971
the fucking career that I could've had,

32:48.054 --> 32:50.056
-the life that I could've had.
-He's lying.

32:50.557 --> 32:54.144
-He's lying.
-She fucking controls everything

32:54.227 --> 32:56.104
around her and everyone.

32:56.188 --> 32:58.273
And now she's doing it to you.

32:58.356 --> 32:59.733
You took everything from me.

32:59.816 --> 33:02.235
You've lived in my fucking house
since you were 14.

33:02.319 --> 33:04.154
You used me for all my fucking worth

33:04.237 --> 33:06.740
and now you're lying
to my fucking face about it.

33:06.823 --> 33:08.408
I'm not fucking lying,

33:08.492 --> 33:09.701
-you stupid bitch!
-You are fucking lying.

33:09.785 --> 33:10.994
Tell the fucking truth, Xander.

33:11.078 --> 33:15.624
You're more fucking disgusting,
fucked up, and depraved

33:15.707 --> 33:17.876
than your bitch cunt of a mother!

33:22.380 --> 33:23.799
Shock him again.

33:24.216 --> 33:26.134
Please, just don't fucking shock me again.
Okay, fine.

33:26.218 --> 33:27.469
Fine. Please.

33:33.225 --> 33:34.351
Shock him again.

33:37.229 --> 33:38.105
Again.

33:43.485 --> 33:46.571
I'll stop lying! I'll stop.
I'll stop. I'll stop.

33:46.655 --> 33:49.074
Please, I'll fucking stop.

33:49.157 --> 33:50.742
-Say it again.
-I'm lying. I'm lying.

33:50.826 --> 33:52.494
-I'm lying. I'm lying.
-About what? About what?

33:52.577 --> 33:55.038
About everything. I'm fucking lying.

33:55.997 --> 33:57.249
I'm lying.

33:58.834 --> 34:00.210
I'm fucking lying.

34:04.756 --> 34:07.008
I'm a little surprised

34:07.092 --> 34:12.431
I can smell you on my skin
still from last night

34:12.514 --> 34:16.476
And I love it,
and I want it again tonight

34:16.560 --> 34:19.980
I wanna be your girl

34:20.063 --> 34:22.816
Tonight, I wanna be one of your girls

34:22.899 --> 34:25.110
Just need to be one of 'em

34:25.819 --> 34:27.904
And I

34:28.363 --> 34:30.365
Wanna feel your hands on my neck

34:30.449 --> 34:33.410
Like you never touched anyone else's

34:33.493 --> 34:37.664
There's just something
about the way that you give me your love

34:39.458 --> 34:43.378
Love, gave me your love

34:44.212 --> 34:48.633
Tough love, my kind of love

34:54.055 --> 34:56.558
Mm

34:56.892 --> 35:01.646
Give me tough love

35:02.063 --> 35:07.069
Leave me with nothin' when I come down

35:07.152 --> 35:12.783
That's my kind of love

35:12.866 --> 35:15.368
Tough love

35:15.452 --> 35:18.455
Tough love

35:24.002 --> 35:26.046
Let's go! Woo!

35:26.129 --> 35:28.298
Yeah!

35:28.381 --> 35:29.883
That was so fuckin' beautiful.

35:31.676 --> 35:33.178
Are you hearing this shit?

35:33.261 --> 35:35.222
You told me. You told me hits.

35:35.305 --> 35:37.641
That's what you and Chaim said, "hits."

35:37.724 --> 35:40.143
No, I like it.
I very, very much so like it.

35:40.227 --> 35:41.436
Music's killer.

35:41.520 --> 35:45.732
Vocally, if we keep her vocals kinda like,
you know what I mean?

35:45.816 --> 35:48.443
Sing-songy in the middle to--

35:48.527 --> 35:50.987
You think the vocals
should be grittier at that place.

35:51.071 --> 35:53.657
It needs to be like the, uh!

35:53.740 --> 35:55.492
Yeah, I see what you mean.

35:55.575 --> 35:57.035
It's good though, right?

35:57.119 --> 36:00.330
1,000%. That's the only note I have
for the whole fuckin' entire song.

36:00.914 --> 36:02.374
Just more grit.

36:02.457 --> 36:04.876
-More grit. More grit.
-Vocally.

36:05.419 --> 36:07.045
You need to get some rest.

36:08.046 --> 36:09.464
You've just been doing, like,
a lot of blow.

36:09.548 --> 36:11.466
No, no, I didn't do any blow.

36:11.550 --> 36:15.137
Baby, I feel like
you need to get a little bit of sleep.

36:15.220 --> 36:16.346
-You're starting to be like--
-I slept.

36:16.430 --> 36:19.891
All I'm saying is show the world
a little bit more of what you got.

36:20.767 --> 36:22.978
-I like the song the way it is.
-Okay.

36:24.020 --> 36:25.230
But it's just...

36:28.692 --> 36:30.902
It's been a long, it's been a long night.

36:55.844 --> 36:57.304
Look at you.

37:00.223 --> 37:01.600
You're filthy.

37:17.657 --> 37:20.660
So, how much do you know about,
like, his past?

37:20.744 --> 37:22.537
'Cause how long have you guys?

37:22.621 --> 37:27.084
We, you know, we're still
getting to know each other and stuff.

37:27.167 --> 37:28.710
-Right.
-Yeah.

37:28.794 --> 37:33.048
I can't help but continue
to notice his tats.

37:33.131 --> 37:35.217
Oh, yeah. I mean, he's been to prison
like a couple times.

37:35.300 --> 37:38.220
-Okay, so you know they're prison tats?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:38.303 --> 37:39.679
And he told you he went to prison?

37:39.763 --> 37:41.348
Yeah, but he's, like,
really sensitive about it.

37:41.431 --> 37:44.142
He doesn't really like talking about it
with a lotta people.

38:12.963 --> 38:18.051
He had this really fucking crazy,
like, ex-girlfriend.

38:18.135 --> 38:19.511
-Okay.
-And they used to fight a lot.

38:19.594 --> 38:21.388
They had this, like,
really tumultuous relationship.

38:21.471 --> 38:25.142
And there was this one time where I guess,
they were, like, fighting,

38:25.225 --> 38:26.435
and I guess he choked her.

38:26.518 --> 38:27.894
-Who choked who?
-Well, I don't think he choked--

38:27.978 --> 38:29.271
They were, like,
getting in a fight, you know--

38:29.354 --> 38:31.356
-He choked her?
-He held, ya know--

38:31.440 --> 38:33.650
He just was tryna,
like, fend her off, I think.

38:33.734 --> 38:37.904
And she punched him in the face
and I guess he hit her back, ya know?

38:37.988 --> 38:39.781
But like self-defense kinda thing.

38:39.865 --> 38:42.951
The girl kinda made it seem like
he had punched her first.

38:43.034 --> 38:45.912
I mean, at some point, though,
he did hit her, right?

38:45.996 --> 38:47.330
But he was just trying to,
like, defend himself.

38:47.414 --> 38:49.583
And then this girl came out and was like,
"He hit me," and everything,

38:49.666 --> 38:52.878
and, like, made it this whole thing
like he had abused her, ya know?

38:54.546 --> 38:55.547
And then--

38:55.630 --> 38:56.631
And then?

38:57.758 --> 39:00.302
You know,
Tedros was talking about your voice.

39:02.763 --> 39:05.015
He said it's stronger than ever.

39:06.683 --> 39:09.186
I'm gonna let you go
'cause Tedros believes in you, but

39:09.770 --> 39:11.688
you need to do something for him.

39:16.610 --> 39:18.070
There was just this, like, group of girls

39:18.153 --> 39:20.322
that he was working with as,
like, artists.

39:20.405 --> 39:21.448
Like, they were musicians.

39:21.531 --> 39:23.200
-A work situation?
-Yeah.

39:23.283 --> 39:26.787
And they were trying to,
like, extort him for money.

39:26.870 --> 39:29.247
And so, they kinda like all got together

39:29.331 --> 39:31.750
and they went to the cops,
and they told the cops

39:31.833 --> 39:33.210
that he was, like, their pimp.

39:34.002 --> 39:36.129
And then he went to prison for, like,
six years.

39:38.298 --> 39:39.925
Okay.

39:48.600 --> 39:49.768
Joss.

39:53.605 --> 39:54.815
Joss.

39:57.734 --> 39:59.111
Wake up.

40:02.406 --> 40:04.199
I got a great fuckin' idea.

40:04.741 --> 40:05.826
What?

40:06.701 --> 40:08.453
You wanna sell tickets, right?

40:10.038 --> 40:11.665
You gotta go public.

40:19.339 --> 40:21.049
With what?

40:21.675 --> 40:26.138
My earliest memory,
when I was three years old

40:26.221 --> 40:28.974
was of my mother beating me
with a hairbrush.

40:34.271 --> 40:40.152
And for 22 years,
she physically and emotionally

40:40.235 --> 40:42.279
abused me every day.

40:46.616 --> 40:50.912
And I know that there's a lot of
headlines out there about me,

40:50.996 --> 40:57.669
and it feels kind of chaotic
and like I'm unraveling or something but

40:59.212 --> 41:02.090
since it's just you and me talking,

41:02.174 --> 41:06.428
I just wanna extend my deepest gratitude

41:06.511 --> 41:10.724
to all of you for allowing me to

41:11.850 --> 41:17.105
process what's been
the most difficult time in my whole life.

41:18.482 --> 41:19.691
And

41:36.541 --> 41:42.714
and I also wanna make a promise
to you, to all of you,

41:42.798 --> 41:47.427
that I'm not gonna let
the trauma of my past

41:47.511 --> 41:51.306
affect the person that I
wanna be moving forward.

41:52.432 --> 41:55.435
So, to all of you
who have already bought tickets

41:55.894 --> 41:59.231
I just wanna say thank you so much
for being so patient.

41:59.731 --> 42:05.737
And, I promise you,
there is a new Jocelyn coming.

42:09.908 --> 42:10.909
Yeah, Joss.

42:12.619 --> 42:14.579
Party time. Let's go!

42:40.981 --> 42:43.567
There's a lotta tequila in this,
so brace yourself.

42:46.153 --> 42:48.613
Don't waste the tequila.
You gotta drink it up.

42:56.121 --> 42:57.914
What are you doing? It's a party.

42:57.998 --> 43:00.584
Yeah, I know.
The wood is teak, so I was just--

43:00.667 --> 43:02.085
-The wood is what?
-It's teak.

43:02.169 --> 43:05.172
So, I just was cleaning it up,
so that it doesn't stain.

43:06.089 --> 43:07.466
Are you, are you--

43:07.549 --> 43:09.551
-You're fuckin' with me, right?
-What?

43:09.634 --> 43:11.136
What's the fucking problem?

43:11.219 --> 43:12.554
There's not a problem. I'm just--

43:12.637 --> 43:14.389
You're ruining the whole fucking night

43:14.473 --> 43:16.433
and you're still a fucking bitch

43:16.516 --> 43:17.976
for no fuckin' reason!

43:18.059 --> 43:19.519
It's a party all the time.

43:19.603 --> 43:21.313
-You know, you know--
-I'm just tryna keep it together.

43:21.396 --> 43:22.606
You know what?
You're absolutely right.

43:22.689 --> 43:23.774
I just wanna show you something.

43:23.857 --> 43:25.275
Oh, my God. Stop!

43:25.358 --> 43:27.611
Stop! Fucking stop!

43:27.694 --> 43:29.446
And just for that,
you just got a fuckin'--

43:29.529 --> 43:34.451
Ah! Shove it, shove it, shove it, ah!

43:39.331 --> 43:41.166
-Oh, come on. Come on.
-Come on.

43:41.249 --> 43:44.127
-Come on, Leia. Leia.
-Leia!

43:44.211 --> 43:46.671
-Are you fucking serious?
-What?

43:46.755 --> 43:49.341
She's my friend. You just, like,
embarrassed her in front of everyone.

43:49.424 --> 43:51.760
Wait, are you actually mad
about what just happened?

43:51.843 --> 43:54.262
She doesn't fucking like you.
Why would she like you?

43:55.138 --> 43:56.723
-Jocelyn.
-It's alright. It's alright.

43:56.807 --> 43:58.308
Jocelyn, get back here.

44:03.563 --> 44:05.023
What did you take?

44:05.482 --> 44:07.609
-Molly!
-You took molly?

44:07.692 --> 44:09.486
Yeah.

44:09.569 --> 44:11.196
Are you feeling good?

44:12.030 --> 44:13.990
-Yeah.
-I've never taken molly, actually.

44:14.408 --> 44:15.242
Yeah.

44:15.325 --> 44:16.868
Feels like it's been two days.

44:20.122 --> 44:21.456
Dyanne's here.

44:22.332 --> 44:23.750
-How are you?
-What are you doing here?

44:24.418 --> 44:25.252
What are you doing here?

44:25.335 --> 44:27.087
-You texted me...
-What do you mean?

44:27.170 --> 44:29.172
I just hope she's not mad at you.

44:30.215 --> 44:31.758
Why would she be mad at me?

44:32.592 --> 44:34.428
'Cause of you and Tedros.

44:35.971 --> 44:37.764
Why would she be mad about me and Tedros?

44:37.848 --> 44:41.184
'Cause, I know she really likes him.

44:43.645 --> 44:46.731
When Tedros told Dyanne
to bring you to the club,

44:46.815 --> 44:49.359
she didn't think
he would have sex with you.

44:50.193 --> 44:53.029
-What's up, baby?
-You texted me an hour ago saying--

44:53.113 --> 44:56.199
Yeah. No, yeah, I was--
I just came from there.

45:06.668 --> 45:08.086
Hi, Joss.

45:09.004 --> 45:10.005
-Hi.
-Hey!

45:10.589 --> 45:11.423
Hey.

45:11.506 --> 45:13.216
I missed you.

45:13.800 --> 45:16.052
I missed you, too.

45:17.220 --> 45:18.680
-You okay?
-Yeah.

45:19.848 --> 45:23.143
So, I feel like
I have to tell you something.

45:23.226 --> 45:24.561
What's that?

45:25.437 --> 45:29.524
So, when you left the other day,

45:29.608 --> 45:34.154
Nikki asked me to step in
and perform "World Class Sinner."

45:36.406 --> 45:38.450
And I just signed with Magistrate,

45:38.533 --> 45:41.078
and she wants me to have
"World Class Sinner"

45:41.161 --> 45:42.913
as my first single.

45:45.248 --> 45:46.875
Oh, wow.

45:47.459 --> 45:49.920
But I didn't say yes.

45:50.003 --> 45:53.340
I said I would ask you first.
I know it was your song.

45:56.134 --> 45:58.762
Congratulations. That's crazy.

46:00.013 --> 46:03.892
I mean, that's a huge opportunity
and I'm--

46:03.975 --> 46:06.103
I would feel awful
to stand in the way of that,

46:06.186 --> 46:08.063
-so, of course.
-Really?

46:08.146 --> 46:10.690
You should take it.
Yeah, of course.

46:10.774 --> 46:12.234
-Are you crying?
-Sorry.

46:12.317 --> 46:14.945
-Why are you crying?
-I'm really happy for you.

46:16.571 --> 46:17.906
-Thank you.
-I'm gonna go get you a drink.

46:17.989 --> 46:19.032
Okay.

46:59.114 --> 47:04.077
We can open up, we can get personal
if you take a hit of this.

47:05.120 --> 47:06.830
Really get to know one another?

47:06.913 --> 47:08.457
I'm an open book.

47:14.463 --> 47:16.173
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, D.

47:18.467 --> 47:21.344
-Oh, shit. What the fuck?
-What?

47:21.428 --> 47:24.347
Isn't that Jocelyn's ex, Rob, over there?

47:25.390 --> 47:27.392
What the fuck?
Hey. I'll be right back.

47:30.562 --> 47:32.022
Bitch ass.

47:39.112 --> 47:41.698
Hey, you want a shot? Rob?

47:44.451 --> 47:45.577
Yeah, sure.

47:54.503 --> 47:56.129
So, who invited you, Rob?

47:57.672 --> 47:58.673
Jocelyn.

47:59.925 --> 48:00.926
When?

48:02.761 --> 48:05.055
-Tonight.
-What time?

48:06.723 --> 48:08.141
How do you know Jocelyn?

48:08.934 --> 48:10.435
Let's take another shot?

48:11.061 --> 48:12.395
That's a big shot you got there, man.

48:16.108 --> 48:18.068
You good?

48:21.405 --> 48:23.782
Yo, man. You sure about that?

48:23.865 --> 48:27.202
-You okay?
-Let's go, let's go. It's a party.

48:28.370 --> 48:30.288
Bottoms up!

48:37.212 --> 48:38.922
Are you sure you want to do another one?

48:39.005 --> 48:40.340
What are you, a faggot?

48:46.263 --> 48:47.722
I'm just concerned about you, man.

48:47.806 --> 48:49.182
You're an actor, right?

48:49.266 --> 48:51.351
Yeah, every actor I know
is a fucking faggot.

48:54.896 --> 48:57.482
Doesn't everybody gotta take it up the ass
to get these roles out here?

48:58.108 --> 49:00.193
Come on, man. What--

49:03.989 --> 49:06.116
-I told you I--
-Whoo!

49:13.957 --> 49:15.751
What, you got some moves?

49:15.834 --> 49:16.918
-Come here.
-Okay.

49:17.002 --> 49:18.003
-Come here.
-All right.

49:19.254 --> 49:20.422
Go on. Come here.

49:20.505 --> 49:21.923
-Come here.
-You got a little--

49:22.007 --> 49:25.427
Mike, we need some music that

49:25.510 --> 49:27.637
-matches the vibe.
-No, come on, man. Eyes over here, man.

49:29.681 --> 49:31.308
Hey, look,
as long as you keep a good distance,

49:31.391 --> 49:32.267
you'll be good, all right?

49:32.350 --> 49:34.686
-Aight. Aight. I went like that!
-Yeah.

49:34.770 --> 49:35.771
Show you that.

49:38.523 --> 49:40.025
Here we go, here we go.

49:40.108 --> 49:42.861
What'd I say? Hands up, no?
What'd I say? Didn't I say that?

49:42.944 --> 49:44.071
-Didn't I say that?
-Yo, man.

49:44.154 --> 49:45.280
Whoo!

49:45.363 --> 49:47.908
-Just keep it-- If you keep it--
-Whoo! Whoo!

49:47.991 --> 49:49.117
All right, all right.

49:49.201 --> 49:50.744
Whoo! Whoo!

49:55.582 --> 49:57.626
I'm so happy you came.

49:58.335 --> 50:00.629
By the way,
have you met the Kung Fu Master here?

50:03.381 --> 50:04.382
No.

50:05.050 --> 50:06.843
I don't need to. Come on.

50:17.145 --> 50:19.815
So, what did I do to deserve a text back?

50:21.691 --> 50:22.984
You were on my mind.

50:24.820 --> 50:26.780
I feel like I never should've left.

50:26.863 --> 50:29.991
Well, I would've resented you for staying.
It was too good of an opportunity.

50:30.075 --> 50:31.785
It's a superhero movie.

50:31.868 --> 50:36.039
My face is visible
for literally five percent of the film.

50:36.123 --> 50:38.375
The rest of the time, I'm wearing a mask.

50:38.458 --> 50:40.627
They could've cast anybody in that part.

50:40.710 --> 50:41.920
Rob.

50:42.546 --> 50:44.339
I've seen that latex suit.

50:45.132 --> 50:47.134
I recognize that ass.

50:47.801 --> 50:50.846
That's so embarrassing.

50:53.849 --> 50:55.851
If I had to do it all over again,
I think that--

50:57.894 --> 50:58.979
You still would've gone.

50:59.438 --> 51:01.523
And if you hadn't,
I would've forced you.

51:05.736 --> 51:07.279
Why didn't you tell me any of this shit?

51:08.488 --> 51:09.865
Tell you what?

51:09.948 --> 51:12.701
I don't know, about your mom.

51:12.784 --> 51:14.870
The fact that she'd been abusing you
all these years.

51:15.537 --> 51:18.331
Well, if I'd known you
were gonna come over and

51:18.415 --> 51:21.042
talk about my mom,
I probably wouldn't have texted you.

51:21.668 --> 51:22.669
Yeah.

51:23.962 --> 51:26.131
That actually kind of hurts my feelings.

51:28.049 --> 51:29.259
Rob,

51:29.801 --> 51:31.219
you're killing me.

51:35.474 --> 51:37.434
You've been ignoring me for a month.

51:37.517 --> 51:40.145
You changed your phone number
and every time I try to call Leia,

51:40.228 --> 51:41.354
she says she can't get ahold of you.

51:41.438 --> 51:42.814
I can't hear a word you're saying, Rob.

51:57.204 --> 52:01.083
Did you say that you care about me
or that you love me? I didn't hear.

52:06.338 --> 52:09.508
I said, put some clothes on,
you fucking lunatic.

52:11.176 --> 52:12.385
You're no fun.

52:25.482 --> 52:26.650
Jocelyn?

52:30.320 --> 52:31.947
Open the door.

52:33.740 --> 52:35.700
Open the fuckin' door.

52:56.012 --> 53:02.144
An endless love... I've found in you

53:02.227 --> 53:08.233
Warm as a fire in everything you do

53:08.859 --> 53:11.278
Two joined together

53:11.361 --> 53:13.989
You know, I bought this outfit
to come and meet you in Germany

53:15.031 --> 53:19.077
before you fucked your costar
and broke my delicate, little heart.

53:19.161 --> 53:24.166
For the record, you're the one that said
it was boring to be monogamous.

53:30.422 --> 53:32.132
Well, I take it back.

53:32.549 --> 53:35.552
Ooh, ooh

53:44.186 --> 53:46.146
There's plenty of guys in the world
you can have sex with

53:46.229 --> 53:48.565
who won't ask you any questions.

53:48.648 --> 53:50.484
But they're not you.

53:53.070 --> 53:54.446
That's right.

53:55.322 --> 53:57.032
I actually know you.

54:06.124 --> 54:09.169
I have this image of you
giving her a bath.

54:09.920 --> 54:11.880
You were always so tender with her.

54:14.216 --> 54:17.385
I can't imagine how fucking difficult
this must be.

54:17.469 --> 54:20.680
It's just awful. All of it.

54:31.858 --> 54:35.320
I promise. I'm in a really good place.

54:38.782 --> 54:40.158
Yeah.

54:40.242 --> 54:42.452
You're in such a good place
that now you're throwin'

54:42.536 --> 54:43.620
house parties.

55:08.145 --> 55:10.730
In five hours,
I have to leave for the press tour.

55:10.814 --> 55:12.357
That's so exciting.

55:14.401 --> 55:16.528
-Come with me.
-I wish.

55:17.946 --> 55:20.532
The studio gave me a private jet.

55:20.615 --> 55:22.242
-Come on.
-I can't.

55:22.325 --> 55:23.744
Come on.

55:39.050 --> 55:40.886
You know what I love most about you?

55:43.889 --> 55:45.265
When you want something

55:47.434 --> 55:49.394
you find a way to get it.

57:01.341 --> 57:04.052
-Hey.
-Yo, Xander. What's up, man?

57:04.136 --> 57:05.762
-What's up?
-Good to see you, buddy.

57:05.846 --> 57:07.806
-How's it goin'?
-I'm headin' out.

57:07.889 --> 57:09.975
Nice, nice. Before you go.

57:10.058 --> 57:11.101
This is my friend, Sophie.

57:11.184 --> 57:12.102
-Hi.
-Hey.

57:12.185 --> 57:13.395
It's so nice to meet you.

57:13.478 --> 57:14.813
Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

57:14.896 --> 57:16.857
-She's also a huge fan of yours.
-Thank you, thanks.

57:16.940 --> 57:19.234
And it would mean the world
if we could just take, like, one photo.

57:19.317 --> 57:20.152
She's like my best friend.

57:20.235 --> 57:21.445
-Seriously.
-Just one photo.

57:21.528 --> 57:23.905
It'll take, like, two seconds,
please, bro.

57:23.989 --> 57:25.949
-All right. Sure. Yeah. Why not?
-Okay. Thank you.

57:26.032 --> 57:27.325
-Thank you so much.
-Just like, where do you--

57:27.409 --> 57:29.453
-How you wanna do it?
-I guess just, like, sit on the stairs.

57:31.246 --> 57:33.123
-Alright. Like?
-Yeah.

57:33.206 --> 57:35.375
-Oh, okay.
-Nice.

57:35.459 --> 57:38.170
All right, Sorry. I really--

57:38.253 --> 57:40.213
Wow, Soph,

57:40.297 --> 57:42.674

-This is perfect.

57:44.092 --> 57:45.677
-Xander, shut it down, man.
-Okay. No. Yeah, yeah.

57:45.761 --> 57:47.471
-Alright, I gotta-- My driver.
-Do you think we got it?

57:47.554 --> 57:49.014

-Did we get it?
-It's perfect.

58:14.164 --> 58:18.752
I was dreamin' of the past

58:19.795 --> 58:24.549
And my heart was beating fast

58:25.175 --> 58:29.638
I began to lose control

58:30.722 --> 58:35.685
I began to lose control

58:36.228 --> 58:40.232
I didn't mean to hurt you

58:41.358 --> 58:47.322
I'm sorry that I made you cry

58:47.406 --> 58:51.868
I didn't mean to hurt you

58:52.702 --> 58:56.164
I'm just a jealous guy

58:58.375 --> 59:02.379
I was feelin' insecure

59:03.755 --> 59:07.968
You might not love me anymore

59:09.469 --> 59:12.889
I was shiverin' inside

59:14.933 --> 59:20.105
I was shiverin' inside

59:20.188 --> 59:25.026
I didn't mean to hurt you, yeah

59:25.569 --> 59:31.199
I'm sorry that I made you cry

59:31.700 --> 59:35.162
I didn't mean to hurt you

59:36.788 --> 59:40.417
I'm just a jealous guy
