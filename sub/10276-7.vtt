Zandar and I want to practice
our flying carpet dance

01:06.901 --> 01:09.201
so we're ready for the museum
opening party tonight.

01:09.203 --> 01:12.237
Flying carpets? Ooh.
All that zipping around.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.106
I'm glad I'll be

01:14.108 --> 01:17.576
Ahem. Your Majesties,
this delivery
has just arrived.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.978
Thank you.
Ooh, what's in it?

01:21.347 --> 01:23.248
"For the royal family of Tangu,

01:23.250 --> 01:25.918
a gift for
your new palace museum."

01:25.920 --> 01:27.586
This was sent
to the wrong kingdom.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.221
I wonder what's inside?

01:29.223 --> 01:31.790
Wup-wup-wup-wup-wup!
It isn't ours to open, Sofia.

01:31.792 --> 01:35.094
I'll have a messenger
deliver this to Tangu
immediately.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.361
Why don't I just
take it, Dad?

01:36.363 --> 01:37.496
I'm going there anyway.

01:38.631 --> 01:40.032
Okay, Sofia.

01:40.034 --> 01:42.034
But take it straight
to the palace.

01:42.036 --> 01:44.636
I'm sure whatever's in here
is  <i> very  </i> important.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.804
I will, Dad.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.372
See you tonight!

01:50.977 --> 01:52.778
( horses whinny )

01:53.947 --> 01:55.414
( clanking )

01:55.416 --> 01:56.815
Oh!

01:56.817 --> 01:59.451
Hmm. That's weird.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.588
( clanking )

02:02.590 --> 02:05.224
I wonder what's
making that sound?

02:05.226 --> 02:06.625
VOICE: Whoa!

02:10.630 --> 02:11.897
Oh, right.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.832
I'm not supposed to open it.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.101
Do  <i> not  </i> open it.

02:16.103 --> 02:18.437
But one little peek
can't hurt.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.005
Huh? A lamp?

02:20.007 --> 02:23.509
What's so important
about this dusty old thing?

02:24.978 --> 02:26.311
I'm out! I'm out!

02:26.313 --> 02:28.981
I'm finally out!
Who are you?

02:28.983 --> 02:33.852
I'm Kazeem, the greatest
wish-granting genie
there ever was!

02:33.854 --> 02:36.822
Or least I  <i> will  </i> be
once I start granting wishes.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.023
It's my first time
out of the lamp.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.592
Who are you?
I'm Princess Sofia.

02:40.594 --> 02:43.662
Well, Princess Sofia,
this is your lucky day!

02:43.664 --> 02:47.266
What kind of fun-tastic
zle-dazzle wish do  <i> you  </i> want?

02:47.268 --> 02:49.201
Uh, no, wait.

02:49.203 --> 02:51.470
I wish for you to
go back in your lamp

02:51.472 --> 02:53.672
so I can take you to Tangu
like I promised.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.874
Anhhh!
No can do.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.976
I want to have fun
granting fun wishes!

02:57.978 --> 03:01.847
And that wish is bo-ring!
So I'm outta here.

03:01.849 --> 03:05.050
Fun, fun, fun,
here I come!

03:05.052 --> 03:07.819
Kazeem! Come back!

03:07.821 --> 03:10.722
Ohh! I thought genies were only
supposed to grant wishes

03:10.724 --> 03:13.725
to the person who lets them
out of the lamp.
Wouldn't know, Miss.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.161
I've never let a genie
out of a lamp before.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.564
Well, we have to get Kazeem
back in his lamp

03:18.566 --> 03:20.732
and deliver it in time
for the party tonight.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.868
Follow him, please--
and hurry!

03:22.870 --> 03:24.236
Hyah!
( horses whinny )

03:28.708 --> 03:30.676
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!

03:30.678 --> 03:33.312
Where there's people,
there's gotta be wishes!

03:33.314 --> 03:35.981
Who's got a wish?
Anyone got a wish?

03:35.983 --> 03:37.883
Do  <i> you  </i> have a wish, sir?

03:37.885 --> 03:41.153
Oh, I wish I had
more dates to sell,
but I'm all out.

03:41.155 --> 03:43.088
Then dates you will have!

03:43.090 --> 03:45.090
Kablooey!

03:45.092 --> 03:47.259
(gasps) It's a miracle!

03:47.261 --> 03:50.696
Oh, your poor little
thirsty leaves.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.564
I wish it would rain.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.366
And so it shall!

03:54.368 --> 03:55.901
Kablooey!

03:55.903 --> 03:57.169
( thunder crackles )

03:59.105 --> 04:02.040
Thank you, little genie!
You got it!

04:02.042 --> 04:03.809
( horses whinny )

04:09.015 --> 04:11.416
There he is!
Land the coach, please!

04:11.418 --> 04:13.285
KAZEEM: Whoa-ho!

04:18.591 --> 04:19.858
Kazeem!

04:19.860 --> 04:23.128
Kazeem! Please get back
in your lamp!

04:23.130 --> 04:27.199
No can do, Princess.
I'm having  <i> way  </i> too much fun!

04:29.369 --> 04:31.770
I wish you were
real elephants.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.372
Kablooey!

04:34.807 --> 04:37.542
( elephants trumpeting )
Wow!

04:37.544 --> 04:39.911
Kazeem! You have to stop
granting wishes,

04:39.913 --> 04:41.980
and you have to
get back in your lamp
right now!

04:41.982 --> 04:44.783
Why would I stop
granting wishes?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.818
Granting wishes
makes people happy,

04:46.820 --> 04:48.787
and I love
making people happy!

04:48.789 --> 04:50.555
I'm a happy-people-maker!

04:50.557 --> 04:52.624
( elephant
trumpets )

04:52.626 --> 04:54.793
Ohh! Come back!

04:54.795 --> 04:56.495
Grrr!
( creaking )

04:56.497 --> 04:57.696
Uh-oh.

04:58.798 --> 04:59.798
My fruit!

04:59.800 --> 05:02.934
Oh, Here go my plants!

05:02.936 --> 05:04.569
MAN: My overpriced trinkets!

05:08.841 --> 05:12.110
( groans )   <i> Now  </i> how am I
going to find him?

05:12.112 --> 05:13.412
Madam Ubetcha.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.247
Madam, Ubetcha,
I need your help.

05:15.249 --> 05:16.848
( Russian accent )
Do not tell me!

05:16.850 --> 05:19.484
You are looking for genie.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.819
How did you know?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.921
I know all, young lady.

05:22.923 --> 05:27.426
Plus I saw genie fly by
and you have lamp.
Is kind of no-brainer.

05:27.428 --> 05:31.663
Do you know where he went?
No, but I can tell you
how to find him.

05:31.665 --> 05:35.834
At end of alley,
you will see
giant gold lamp.

05:35.836 --> 05:39.671
And Kazeem is there?
He is not,
but Genie Patrol is.

05:39.673 --> 05:43.108
Genie Patrol?
They will help you find
your missing genie.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.644
It is what they do.
Okay, thanks!

05:45.646 --> 05:46.878
Ubetcha!

05:51.451 --> 05:54.953
Oh! It really  <i> is </i>
a big gold lamp!

06:03.363 --> 06:05.230
Genie Patrol. Huh?

06:05.232 --> 06:07.966
Uh, hello. I, um...

06:07.968 --> 06:10.469
let a genie out of a lamp
and now I can't find him.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.972
Well, you'll have to talk
to a patrolman, Miss.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.874
Patrolman?

06:20.513 --> 06:22.180
So we got a runaway genie,
do we?

06:22.182 --> 06:23.815
Yeah, I guess so.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.517
Name.
Sofia.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.886
Not you, the genie's.
Kazeem.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.888
Did he grant you three wishes
when you let him out?

06:29.890 --> 06:32.357
No, but he's been granting
everyone   <i> else's  </i> wishes.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.693
See, it's his first time
out of the lamp, and--

06:34.695 --> 06:36.428
Whoa! First-timer?

06:36.430 --> 06:38.730
I'll get the sergeant.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.065
The sergeant?

06:40.067 --> 06:41.500
Good work, patrolman.

06:41.502 --> 06:42.367
I'll take it from here.

06:45.938 --> 06:48.106
Sergeant Fizz.
Genie Patrol.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.508
Wait a second.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.510
Are all the genies here
really just you?

06:51.512 --> 06:53.378
What? No, no, no, no, no, no.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.280
Okay, yeah, you got me.
We're a little understaffed.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.382
Now if this Kazeem
is a fresh genie
fresh out of the lamp,

06:57.384 --> 06:58.750
he probably hasn't learned
the genie rules yet.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.085
There are genie rules?

07:00.087 --> 07:02.053
You better believe there are.

07:02.055 --> 07:05.957

Bingo!

09:32.372 --> 09:35.373
Just as I suspected:
a birthday party.

09:35.375 --> 09:38.176
What does that mean?
It means it'll be
crawling with wishes.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.011

Queen Miranda.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.960
You know the party doesn't start
until this evening.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.695
Oh, we know, but we thought
we'd come early

09:56.697 --> 09:59.064
to watch Sofia
and Zandar's rehearsal.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.766
And provide a safety net.
Just in case. ( chuckles )

10:01.768 --> 10:04.102
We haven't started practicing,
King Roland.

10:04.104 --> 10:07.138
Sofia isn't here yet.
But she left hours ago.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.707
She should have
been here by now.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.875
Maybe she stopped off
at the marketplace.

10:10.877 --> 10:13.211
She was supposed to come
straight here.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.113
Hmm. I think we should
go look for her.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.282

Uh, excuse me.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.284

to travel.

10:22.221 --> 10:23.555
Oh, no.

10:23.557 --> 10:26.658
Hop on. I'll take you
to look for Sofia myself.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.727
Oh, come on, Rollie.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.929
Well, uh...I don't--

10:30.931 --> 10:32.297
Whoa!!!

Hold on!

10:50.150 --> 10:53.318
I wish for the biggest cookie
ever!

10:53.320 --> 10:54.753
Me too!

10:56.255 --> 10:57.989
Kablooey!

10:57.991 --> 10:59.324
Happy birthday!

10:59.326 --> 11:02.027
Freeze!

11:02.029 --> 11:05.330
Now stop granting wishes
and return to your lamp
immediately!

11:05.332 --> 11:06.331
Says who?!

11:06.333 --> 11:09.134
Sergeant Fizz,
Genie Patrol.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.269
You've already
met my partner.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.804
You have to stop, Kazeem!

11:12.806 --> 11:14.305
You're breaking
the genie rules!

11:14.307 --> 11:17.442
What genie rules?
<i> These  </i> genie rules.

11:17.444 --> 11:20.445
See this? Rule one:
Only grant wishes to
the person

11:20.447 --> 11:22.380
who lets you
out of the lamp.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.616
But I like granting
<i> everyone's  </i> wishes!

11:24.618 --> 11:27.786
And I like going to bed at night
knowing cookies are bite-size.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.954
But--
I'll let you off
with a warning,

11:29.956 --> 11:33.525
provided you get
back in your lamp
and learn the rules.

11:33.527 --> 11:36.027
Anhh! Bo-ring!

11:36.029 --> 11:37.529
Please, Kazeem?

11:37.531 --> 11:39.831
I'll take your lamp
to the palace for a big party.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.233
Everyone will see it
and be so happy!

11:42.235 --> 11:44.235
You love making people happy,
right?

11:44.237 --> 11:45.303
I do!

11:45.305 --> 11:47.305
But I'm not
going in my lamp

11:47.307 --> 11:49.641
and I'm not learning
any rules.

11:49.643 --> 11:52.811
I'm granting wishes,
and you can't stop me.

11:57.416 --> 11:59.350
We got a flier.
We've got a flier!

11:59.352 --> 12:00.652
All patrollers respond.

12:00.654 --> 12:02.220
That's us.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.322
( revs "engine" )

12:04.324 --> 12:06.658
( siren wailing )

12:10.496 --> 12:11.563
Sorry!

12:15.434 --> 12:18.103
Sergeant Fizz, can you make
these wishes disappear?

12:18.105 --> 12:21.573
No, Sofia. Only the genie
who grants a wish
can undo the wish.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.074
Rule twenty-one.

12:24.276 --> 12:25.944
Camel!
Evasive action!

12:28.714 --> 12:31.282
Whoa!

12:31.284 --> 12:33.284
Is that a flying camel?

12:33.286 --> 12:34.285
Whoa-ho!

12:34.287 --> 12:35.353
Ha ha!

12:38.257 --> 12:39.491
Sure is!

12:47.399 --> 12:48.566
Uh-oh!

12:48.568 --> 12:51.302
I think he's angry! Dive!

12:51.304 --> 12:52.470
Huh?

12:52.472 --> 12:54.439
( Roland screams )

12:54.441 --> 12:58.276
( Roland exclaiming )

12:58.278 --> 12:59.644
Whoa!

13:01.781 --> 13:03.448
Over there!

13:03.450 --> 13:06.718
That's right!
You wish it, I'll grant it!

13:06.720 --> 13:08.553
Not this time, bub.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.291
We got ya, Kazeem.
There's nowhere to fly.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.460
Now get back in your lamp
with your hands up.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.495
Please, Kazeem.
Do what he says.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.932
Quick, kids! Wish for
Sergeant Fizz to be
stuck in that lamp,

13:20.934 --> 13:22.667
and I'll grant
<i> all  </i> of your wishes!

13:22.669 --> 13:24.569
No!
Don't do it, kids!

13:24.571 --> 13:28.106
ALL: I wish Sergeant Fizz
was stuck in the lamp.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.941
Kablooey!

13:29.943 --> 13:34.412
Of all the dirty tricks.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.314
FIZZ: Officer down!
Officer down!

13:36.316 --> 13:37.348
Sergeant Fizz!

13:37.350 --> 13:39.350
Thanks, guys!
Now come with me

13:39.352 --> 13:42.453
and I'll grant all
your fun-tastic wishes!

13:42.455 --> 13:45.423
Sergeant Fizz?
Sergeant Fizz!

13:45.425 --> 13:48.293
He's getting away!
Come back out, Sarge!

13:48.295 --> 13:49.861
FIZZ: I can't.
Only the genie

13:49.863 --> 13:51.930
who grants a wish
can undo the wish, remember?

13:51.932 --> 13:53.932
Rule twenty-one.
That's right.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.334
You're stuck
until Kazeem lets you out!

13:56.336 --> 13:58.536
Ohh! If only I hadn't
opened that box,

13:58.538 --> 14:00.438
none of this
would have happened!

14:00.440 --> 14:02.173
FIZZ: There's no time
to play the blame game.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.309
Kazeem's still out there
wreaking magical havoc,

14:04.311 --> 14:06.144
and it's up to you
to stop him.

14:06.146 --> 14:10.081
You're the Genie Patrol now,
Sofia. Make me proud, partner.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.451
Uh, you still there?
Yes!

14:13.453 --> 14:15.920
And I won't let you down,
Sarge.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.491
Let's catch that genie!

14:20.493 --> 14:22.827
( siren wails )

14:22.829 --> 14:25.797
Look at all the balloons!
Thanks, Kazeem!

14:25.799 --> 14:28.333
Pet elephants?
ALL: Yay!

14:28.335 --> 14:30.501
These kids sure love elephants.

14:30.503 --> 14:31.569
( siren approaches )

14:31.571 --> 14:33.905
Genie Patrol! Stop right there!

14:33.907 --> 14:35.640
Gotta go!

14:38.010 --> 14:39.978
Whoa!

14:39.980 --> 14:42.480
( laughing )

14:44.250 --> 14:45.817
( elephant trumpets )

14:45.819 --> 14:47.485
( all screaming )

14:55.561 --> 14:57.528
ROLAND: Whoa!

14:57.530 --> 14:59.998
All right, looks like
we lost that camel.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.533
Maybe now
we can slow down?

15:02.535 --> 15:04.068
And find Sofia.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.703
There she is!

15:05.705 --> 15:08.439
Carpet, follow
that princess!

15:08.441 --> 15:09.974
Whoa!

15:10.910 --> 15:12.176
( exclaiming )

15:14.246 --> 15:15.413
Balloons?!

15:15.415 --> 15:18.082
Whoa! Aw, come on!

15:18.084 --> 15:20.418
Kazeem, I let you
out of the lamp,

15:20.420 --> 15:22.287
you have to grant  <i> my  </i> wishes.

15:22.289 --> 15:25.256
It's rule number one.
Now stop running away!

15:25.258 --> 15:27.525
You have to catch me first!

15:27.527 --> 15:29.560
( Sofia exclaims )

15:29.562 --> 15:32.463
That's the best you can do?
( laughs )

15:32.465 --> 15:34.632
Come on! I'm not even
breaking a sweat!

15:34.634 --> 15:39.237
SOFIA: Stop! Kazeem, stop!

15:39.239 --> 15:41.806
Kazeem, get back
in your lamp
right now!

15:41.808 --> 15:45.076
Another boring suggestion
by Princess Sofia!

15:45.078 --> 15:47.445
( Sofia yells )

15:47.447 --> 15:50.248
FIZZ: What's happening?
You okay, partner?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.582
Yeah, I'm okay.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.418
Nyah-nyah!
Kazeem!

15:53.420 --> 15:56.321
I'm not going back
in that lamp, Princess Sofia!

15:56.323 --> 15:59.824
There. Perfect.
I just wish we had
more entertainment

15:59.826 --> 16:01.326
for the party tonight.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.560
Jugglers, perhaps.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.062
Jugglers?

16:04.064 --> 16:06.831
I'll give you something
better than that!

16:06.833 --> 16:08.633
Kablooey!

16:10.903 --> 16:13.471
Are those monkeys?
Oh, no!

16:13.473 --> 16:14.472
You're welcome!

16:14.474 --> 16:16.841
Stop! My place settings!

16:16.843 --> 16:19.143
Oh, no! The party!

16:20.579 --> 16:22.513
Watch out for the bananas,
Miranda!

16:22.515 --> 16:24.916
ALL: Whoa!
Look out!

16:25.851 --> 16:27.752
( crash )

16:27.754 --> 16:28.953
( all panting )

16:28.955 --> 16:30.555
Mom? Dad?

16:32.491 --> 16:35.093
Oh!  Hello there!

16:35.095 --> 16:37.328
Still got your spunk, I see.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.529
Are you okay?

16:38.531 --> 16:40.131
Yes.
No.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.933
QUEEN FARNAZ:
What happened out here?

16:41.935 --> 16:44.135
Ahh, Zandar!

16:44.137 --> 16:46.637
What did I tell you
about letting monkeys
in the palace!

16:46.639 --> 16:49.540
But Dad--
He didn't do anything,
Your Majesty.

16:49.542 --> 16:53.177
I did.
Sofia! What do you mean?

16:53.179 --> 16:55.380
I was supposed to
deliver a box to you,

16:55.382 --> 16:58.549
but I peeked inside
and accidentally
let out a genie.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.352
He's been granting wishes
all over Tangu.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.487
( elephant trumpets
in distance )

17:02.489 --> 17:04.655
( crash )
A lot of wishes.

17:04.657 --> 17:08.059
Oh, Sofia. You were supposed
to bring the box straight here

17:08.061 --> 17:09.961
<i> without  </i> opening it.

17:09.963 --> 17:12.463
I know. I'm sorry.

17:12.465 --> 17:15.400
Send word that tonight's
party is canceled.

17:15.402 --> 17:16.701
By your command, King Habib.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.837
But Dad, everyone wants
to see the new museum.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.540
We'll clean everything up.
I promise.

17:22.542 --> 17:26.010
My dear, there is simply no way
your or any of us

17:26.012 --> 17:28.646
can get the palace
straightened up in time!

17:28.648 --> 17:30.915
Not to mention
tracking down that genie.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.917
But I want to fix
the mess I caused.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.019
Please give me a chance,
Your Majesties.

17:35.021 --> 17:39.023
What could  <i> you  </i> possibly do,
Princess Sofia?

17:39.025 --> 17:41.659
( gasps ) Fizz!

17:41.661 --> 17:43.161
What is "Fizz"?

17:43.163 --> 17:44.228
( monkey chittering )

17:46.398 --> 17:48.599
Oh, Fizz, I wish
you weren't stuck in there!

17:48.601 --> 17:51.436
I can't catch Kazeem,
and they're going to
cancel the party!

17:51.438 --> 17:53.438
FIZZ:  It's a cryin' shame, kid.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.773
And Kazeem thinks
he's making people happy.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.942
If only he knew.
Hmm.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.845
Maybe he  <i> should  </i> know.
Come again?

18:00.847 --> 18:03.614
If I can get Kazeem to see
<i> unhappy  </i> he's made everyone,

18:03.616 --> 18:06.284
then maybe he'll undo
all his wishes!

18:06.286 --> 18:09.053
It's a longshot,
but it just might work.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.688
Mom, Dad,
I know what to do,

18:10.690 --> 18:12.256
but I'll need your help.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.725
Good, because I'm not letting
you out of my sight again.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.228
I just need a few minutes,
King Habib.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.763
( whistles )

18:18.765 --> 18:20.965
Hop on!

18:23.635 --> 18:26.737
Oh, why can't we take
a cooaaach?

18:26.739 --> 18:28.639
Okay, who's next?

18:28.641 --> 18:31.109
Step right up
and make a wish!

18:33.779 --> 18:36.047
Ah! What a beautiful day!

18:36.049 --> 18:39.650
I wish we could
sit up on that cloud
and look down at all of Tangu.

18:39.652 --> 18:43.754
Yes, and it would be nice if
a genie would keep us company.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.556
Yes, it would!

18:45.558 --> 18:48.426
Now,  <i> that  </i> is
a fun-tastic wish!

18:48.428 --> 18:50.528
Kablooey!

18:52.798 --> 18:55.299
Ahh. What a view!

18:55.301 --> 18:57.101
Mm-hmm!
( elephants trumpeting )

18:57.103 --> 18:59.303
Hey, what's all that
commotion down there?

18:59.305 --> 19:01.072
It's all the wishes
I've granted.

19:01.074 --> 19:03.441
See how happy
I've made everyone?

19:03.443 --> 19:05.510
But are they really happy,
Kazeem?

19:05.512 --> 19:07.411
Huh? W-What do you mean?

19:07.413 --> 19:08.613
Take a closer look.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.815
The elephants are running wild.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.751
The giant cookies are crushing
al the kids' presents.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.187
And the monkeys
ruined the party.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.689
That's not fun-tastic at  <i> all.</i>

19:18.691 --> 19:20.925
That's why there
are genie rules, Kazeem--

19:20.927 --> 19:22.860
so things don't
get out of hand.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.595
I see what you mean.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.498
(sighs) Okay,
I'll follow the rules.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.101
Great. You can start by
granting  <i> my  </i> three wishes.

19:30.103 --> 19:32.370
All right.
What's your first wish?

19:32.372 --> 19:35.873
I wish for you to
let Sergeant Fizz
out of your lamp.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.109
Do I have to?
It's my wish.

19:38.111 --> 19:40.912
Okay. Kablooey.

19:42.281 --> 19:44.315
You are under arrest, bub.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.384
You have the right to remain
magical. Any wish you grant

19:46.386 --> 19:48.553
can and will be used against you
in a court of whimsy.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.188
You have the right to a wizard.
If you can't afford a wizard,

19:50.190 --> 19:51.989
one will be appointed to you
by the kingdom.

19:51.991 --> 19:54.725
Do you understand
these rights and wrongs
as they're been read to you?

19:54.727 --> 19:55.893
Mm-hmm.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.495
Wait, Sergeant Fizz.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.231
Kazeem is ready
to follow the genie rules.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.333
He's granting
my three wishes
right now.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.569
Is this true?
Yes, Sergeant!

20:04.571 --> 20:06.904
And I'm sorry
I put you in the lamp.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.706
Well, you should be.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.575
For my second wish,

20:10.577 --> 20:13.744
I'd like you to undo
all the other wishes
you made today.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.246
Your wish is my command.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.981
Kablooey!

20:25.324 --> 20:27.391
Thank you, Kazeem.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.096
The party is back on!

20:32.098 --> 20:35.366
Please, everyone,
let's join the festivities.

20:35.368 --> 20:38.269
Well, Sofia, you have
one more wish.

20:38.271 --> 20:42.340
I know. Kazeem,
I need you to
get back in the lamp.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.242
No!
You have to!

20:44.244 --> 20:45.743
You belong in the lamp.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.579
And the lamp belongs to
the king and queen of Tangu.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.781
But it gets lonely in there.

20:50.783 --> 20:53.951
Hey, it gets lonely
being the only officer
in the Genie Patrol.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.753
But not every wish
comes true.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.356
Hmm. But maybe  <i> this  </i> one can.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.357
What do you mean?

20:59.359 --> 21:01.559
I'll be right back.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.261
Here's your lamp, King Habib.

21:03.263 --> 21:06.097
But would you mind
if the genie didn't
go back inside?

21:06.099 --> 21:08.299
I know a place where
he'd be much happier,

21:08.301 --> 21:09.600
and stay out of trouble.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.870
Hmm...that is fine with us.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.239
Great. Kazeem,

21:15.241 --> 21:19.577
for my last wish, I wish for
you to join the Genie Patrol.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.145
If that's okay
with both of you.

21:21.147 --> 21:24.815
Okay?
It sounds fun-tastic!

21:24.817 --> 21:26.784
Now, wait just a second.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.587
You said it gets lonely
being the only patrolman.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.956
Now you'll have a partner.
All the time.

21:33.659 --> 21:37.995
I suppose he could start off
as a junior patrolman.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.631
<i> After  </i> you learn
all the genie rules.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.403
I will! I promise!

21:45.405 --> 21:47.772
Welcome to
the Genie Patrol, kid.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.307
Thank you, Sergeant Fizz!

21:49.309 --> 21:52.143
It won't be the same
without you...partner.

21:52.145 --> 21:55.313
ZANDAR: Sofia, it's time
for our carpet dance!

21:55.315 --> 21:58.949
Well, we never rehearsed,
but the show must fly on!

21:58.951 --> 22:01.419
♪♪

22:04.022 --> 22:07.425
Well, you ready to learn
the genie rules, Kazeem?

22:07.427 --> 22:08.859
I sure am!

22:08.861 --> 22:10.027
All right, then.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.495
We'll start with
rule fifty-two:

22:11.497 --> 22:14.699
Always make a big entrance
and a bigger exit.

22:25.610 --> 22:28.379
( cheers, applause )
