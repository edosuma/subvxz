00:03.869 --> 00:07.701
Captain's log, stardate 5423.4.

00:07.873 --> 00:09.201
We are orbiting the planet Gideon,

00:09.374 --> 00:12.375
which is still not a member
of the United Federation of Planets.

00:12.544 --> 00:14.667
The treaty negotiations
have been difficult

00:14.838 --> 00:17.792
because Gideon has consistently
refused the presence

00:17.966 --> 00:20.374
of a delegation from the Federation
on its soil,

00:20.552 --> 00:23.043
or any surveillance
by the ship's sensors.

00:23.222 --> 00:26.009
They have finally agreed
to a delegation of one.

00:26.725 --> 00:29.513
They insisted it be
the captain of the Enterprise.

00:29.687 --> 00:33.138
I am therefore beaming down
at once.

00:33.316 --> 00:36.067
Too bad Gideon isn't cleared
for general visitation, Mr. Spock.

00:36.235 --> 00:37.777
According
to the physio-cultural reports

00:37.945 --> 00:39.903
submitted to the Federation,
it's a paradise.

00:40.073 --> 00:42.528
I shall be interested in hearing
your description, captain.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.076
You won't have long to wait.

00:45.411 --> 00:47.321
- Lieutenant Uhura.
- Yes, Mr. Spock?

00:47.497 --> 00:49.406
Do we have final clearance
from Gideon?

00:49.582 --> 00:52.868
Yes, Mr. Spock. They have provided us
with the coordinates for beam down.

00:53.586 --> 00:54.915
May I have them, please?

00:55.088 --> 00:57.875
- Eight-seven-five.
- Eight-seven-five.

00:58.049 --> 01:00.623
- Zero-two-zero.
- Zero-two-zero.

01:01.595 --> 01:06.091
- Zero-seven-nine.
- Zero-seven-nine.

01:06.266 --> 01:07.547
Let's go, Mr. Spock.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.268
Energizing.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:30.875 --> 01:32.453
Mr. Spock?

01:36.297 --> 01:38.788
Mr. Spock,
I have not yet transported down.

01:38.967 --> 01:42.003
Why did you leave your post
before confirming transport?

01:43.346 --> 01:44.924
Mr. Spock?

01:46.182 --> 01:47.677
Spock?

02:15.171 --> 02:17.840
Engineering? Mr. Scott?

02:18.007 --> 02:19.501
Scotty?

02:22.553 --> 02:25.720
Lieutenant Uhura,
report immediately.

02:27.016 --> 02:30.681
All Bridge personnel,
report immediately.

02:30.853 --> 02:34.305
Kirk to crew, is anyone aboard?

02:38.611 --> 02:40.485
Sickbay? Dr. McCoy?

02:41.615 --> 02:44.984
Bones, Bones, answer me.

02:46.453 --> 02:48.031
Bones.

03:07.308 --> 03:09.514
Still orbiting Gideon.

03:30.415 --> 03:33.914
Space, the final frontier.

03:39.466 --> 03:43.594
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:43.762 --> 03:47.594
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

03:47.766 --> 03:51.598
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

03:51.770 --> 03:55.389
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.161
I am alone on the Enterprise.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.076
I have searched
every area of the ship

04:54.251 --> 04:56.742
and still cannot find
a trace of the crew

04:56.921 --> 04:59.791
or an indication of how
its disappearance was managed.

05:01.217 --> 05:04.134
One thing that is obvious
is that I suffered a memory lapse,

05:04.303 --> 05:06.925
during which time I bruised my arm.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.506
It is causing me some irritation.

05:10.935 --> 05:13.806
Gideon is contacting us, Mr. Spock.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.522
- Put it on the screen.
- Aye, sir.

05:18.026 --> 05:22.320
Captain Kirk,
this is Ambassador Hodin.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.980
The council is awaiting your arrival.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.989
This is Mr. Spock,
Ambassador Hodin.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.613
Captain Kirk was transported down
minutes ago.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.874
- That's impossible.
- I transported him myself.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.835
He never arrived.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.495
He was beamed directly
to your council chambers.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.714
Please verify your coordinates.

05:45.971 --> 05:52.224
875-020-079.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.434
Coordinates confirmed.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.397
We gave you the exact coordinates,

05:56.566 --> 06:00.065
which should have brought
Captain Kirk directly into this room.

06:00.236 --> 06:02.561
I am not questioning that, sir.

06:02.739 --> 06:07.733
If he is not here, that is
your own responsibility, Mr. Spock,

06:07.911 --> 06:09.369
and that of your staff.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.866
I do not deny that, sir.

06:11.039 --> 06:13.910
I am not attempting
to blame your personnel.

06:14.084 --> 06:16.076
We are glad to hear that.

06:16.253 --> 06:18.541
We shall have to enter it
into the records

06:18.713 --> 06:20.671
of this most unfortunate event.

06:20.841 --> 06:22.383
Your Excellency,

06:22.551 --> 06:26.169
even with intricate machinery
as delicately balanced as ours,

06:26.346 --> 06:29.016
there is still a margin for error
that must be dealt with.

06:29.183 --> 06:30.214
It is possible

06:30.392 --> 06:34.141
that Captain Kirk materialised
on some other part of Gideon.

06:34.313 --> 06:36.389
Let us hope it was on dry land.

06:36.565 --> 06:38.688
Your Excellency.

06:40.444 --> 06:42.484
May I cut
right to the heart of the matter?

06:42.655 --> 06:46.106
I request permission to beam down
to conduct a search for our captain.

06:46.284 --> 06:47.564
Permission denied.

06:47.743 --> 06:49.950
Your Federation must be aware

06:50.121 --> 06:55.460
of our jealous tradition of isolation
from all contaminating contacts

06:55.626 --> 06:59.494
with the violent nature of planets
of other star systems.

06:59.672 --> 07:03.966
Your Excellency, the wars
between opposing star systems

07:04.135 --> 07:06.840
no longer prevail in our galaxy.

07:07.013 --> 07:08.507
If you will grant permission...

07:08.682 --> 07:11.089
Of course, we shall institute
a thorough search.

07:11.601 --> 07:15.979
In the meantime, Mr. Spock, I suggest
that you look to your machinery.

07:17.983 --> 07:20.474
We must acknowledge
once and for all

07:20.652 --> 07:25.647
that the purpose of diplomacy
is to prolong a crisis.

07:25.824 --> 07:28.529
Well, what are we waiting for,
Mr. Spock? We're not diplomats.

07:28.702 --> 07:31.240
We are representatives
of the Federation, doctor.

07:31.413 --> 07:33.572
That doesn't mean
that we have to behave like children

07:33.749 --> 07:36.869
and listen to some fool lecture
by a diplomat.

07:37.044 --> 07:40.663
Unfortunately, diplomacy is the only
channel available to us at the moment.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.667
The planet is shielded
from our sensors,

07:42.842 --> 07:44.336
therefore, we cannot scan it.

07:44.510 --> 07:47.001
Therefore, we are unable
to select coordinates.

07:47.180 --> 07:49.256
They must be provided by Gideon.

07:49.432 --> 07:52.005
We should never have agreed
to such restrictions.

07:52.185 --> 07:56.135
We did not, Mr. Chekov.
The Federation did.

07:56.314 --> 07:57.856
- Lieutenant Uhura.
- Yes, Mr. Spock.

07:58.024 --> 08:00.729
Contact Starfleet immediately.
Explain our problem.

08:00.902 --> 08:03.227
Request permission to use
every means at our disposal

08:03.405 --> 08:04.864
to press the search for Captain Kirk.

08:05.031 --> 08:06.276
At once, sir.

08:06.450 --> 08:09.653
Are there any other possibilities?

08:09.828 --> 08:12.034
There are endless, Mr. Chekov.

08:12.205 --> 08:14.613
But where do we start, Mr. Spock?

08:14.791 --> 08:20.415
Institute a sensor scan 360 degrees,
one degree at a time.

08:21.340 --> 08:23.214
You mean, you're gonna
scan space for him?

08:23.384 --> 08:24.961
But, sir, that could take years.

08:25.135 --> 08:28.670
Then the sooner you begin, the better.

08:28.848 --> 08:30.390
Aye, sir.

08:59.087 --> 09:00.629
Who are you?

09:03.884 --> 09:05.675
Odona.

09:05.844 --> 09:08.881
Yes. My name is Odona.

09:10.599 --> 09:12.093
Why did you bring me here?

09:13.102 --> 09:14.430
What are you doing on my ship?

09:16.855 --> 09:19.477
Is this entire ship yours?

09:19.650 --> 09:23.268
Not my personal property,
but I'm the captain.

09:23.446 --> 09:25.522
And you have it all to yourself?

09:25.698 --> 09:29.743
It seems, at the moment,
we have it all to ourselves.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.410
You're hurting me, captain.

09:33.581 --> 09:36.748
Kirk. I'm sorry. James Kirk.

09:36.918 --> 09:37.997
And I didn't bring you here.

09:38.169 --> 09:39.367
If you didn't bring me here...

09:39.546 --> 09:42.333
That's right.
Who has brought you here?

09:43.550 --> 09:46.800
- I don't know.
- You...

09:51.141 --> 09:52.635
What happened
before you came here?

09:53.894 --> 09:56.467
Try to remember. It's important.

09:59.316 --> 10:03.266
It seems I was standing in a...

10:03.445 --> 10:06.482
Yes, I was standing
in a large auditorium,

10:06.657 --> 10:08.317
crowded with people.

10:08.492 --> 10:10.734
Thousands, pressed in against me.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.489
I could hardly breathe.

10:12.663 --> 10:16.495
I was fighting for oxygen,
screaming to get out.

10:17.877 --> 10:18.956
Don't be afraid.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.504
I'm not,

10:23.174 --> 10:24.419
but you are troubled.

10:25.384 --> 10:29.596
I seem to be the only one of my crew
left onboard the Enterprise.

10:29.764 --> 10:36.265
Four hundred and thirty,
and I, apparently, am the only one left.

10:38.022 --> 10:40.015
I'm sorry. I wish I could help.

10:40.191 --> 10:43.027
Maybe you can. Tell me the rest.

10:43.194 --> 10:47.821
You were fighting for oxygen?
Screaming to get out of there?

10:48.200 --> 10:52.696
And then suddenly,
I was here on this... On your ship.

10:52.871 --> 10:55.576
And there was all this space
and the freedom.

10:55.749 --> 10:57.956
I just wanted to float.

11:00.671 --> 11:03.209
And then there you were.

11:03.591 --> 11:05.334
How long have you been
aboard the Enterprise?

11:06.218 --> 11:09.053
I don't know. Not long.

11:10.681 --> 11:13.848
- Is it important?
- It might be. Come with me.

11:15.895 --> 11:19.975
Lieutenant Uhura, has Starfleet
honoured our request with a reply?

11:20.149 --> 11:22.391
There's been no responses yet, sir.

11:22.568 --> 11:25.320
Did you advise them
that the captain's life is at stake?

11:25.488 --> 11:29.403
Yes, sir. They insist the matter
must be referred to the Federation.

11:29.576 --> 11:32.067
- What department?
- The Bureau of Planetary Treaties.

11:32.245 --> 11:35.330
- Contact them directly.
- I did, Mr. Spock.

11:35.498 --> 11:38.072
They insist that we must
go through Starfleet channels.

11:43.924 --> 11:47.459
With the captain lost somewhere,
that's the best they can come up with?

11:47.636 --> 11:51.005
Diplomats and bureaucrats
may function differently,

11:51.181 --> 11:54.432
but they achieve
exactly the same results.

12:01.692 --> 12:05.737
Nine minutes of my life
has been lost.

12:05.905 --> 12:07.364
I don't understand.

12:07.531 --> 12:09.571
Between the time
I tried to beam down to Gideon

12:09.742 --> 12:11.367
and the time
I found myself here alone,

12:11.536 --> 12:13.327
nine minutes have disappeared,
just like that.

12:13.496 --> 12:16.616
Now, what happened
during those nine minutes?

12:16.791 --> 12:18.119
What is Gideon?

12:19.836 --> 12:21.745
That's your home.

12:22.130 --> 12:24.288
The planet that you come from.

12:24.466 --> 12:26.624
- Is it?
- Well, it must be.

12:29.512 --> 12:33.380
- Gideon? I don't know any Gideon.
- That's impossible.

12:35.310 --> 12:37.801
We were in synchronous orbit
over the capital city of Gideon.

12:37.980 --> 12:40.186
I tried to beam down.
Something happened.

12:40.357 --> 12:43.691
And you were beamed aboard
from Gideon.

12:45.904 --> 12:47.233
I do not think so.

12:57.333 --> 12:59.124
We're no longer over Gideon.

12:59.293 --> 13:00.456
Where are we?

13:00.628 --> 13:04.495
I don't know.
I'm not familiar with that quadrant.

13:06.843 --> 13:08.634
Odona,

13:09.345 --> 13:12.797
you must realise
that we're not here by accident.

13:12.974 --> 13:16.010
Some force, some intelligence

13:16.186 --> 13:18.677
has arranged this

13:18.855 --> 13:20.848
for a purpose.

13:21.024 --> 13:22.684
Captain,

13:23.151 --> 13:25.559
before, I said I wasn't afraid.

13:25.737 --> 13:27.196
Now I am.

13:43.714 --> 13:44.994
The ambassador will speak, sir.

13:45.174 --> 13:47.332
They are requesting
visual communication.

13:47.510 --> 13:50.179
Good news.
Very good news indeed, Mr. Spock.

13:50.346 --> 13:52.754
Your captain
is definitely not on Gideon.

13:52.932 --> 13:55.719
As you requested,
we made a most thorough search.

13:55.893 --> 13:57.091
You will be relieved to know

13:57.270 --> 13:59.595
that you may now investigate
all the other possibilities

13:59.772 --> 14:01.053
and forget about Gideon.

14:01.232 --> 14:04.233
That... That is not
what we requested.

14:04.402 --> 14:07.107
You requested
a most thorough search.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.525
It is in the record.

14:08.698 --> 14:11.818
And we have used every means
at our disposal to accommodate you.

14:11.993 --> 14:14.567
Your record on the subject

14:14.746 --> 14:19.492
is not precise, Your Excellency.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.961
Surely, Mr. Spock,
you do not intend, I hope,

14:26.133 --> 14:29.383
to create a dispute between
the Federation and Gideon.

14:29.553 --> 14:33.503
Your Excellency, a dispute
is the farthest thing from our minds

14:33.682 --> 14:36.849
and there is no need
to check your records.

14:37.019 --> 14:40.388
I merely suggest that the language
of our statement

14:40.564 --> 14:45.807
may not have been understood
exactly as intended.

14:45.987 --> 14:48.525
Mr. Spock,
you are an officer of a spaceship.

14:48.698 --> 14:52.114
In your profession, you use
many instruments, tools and weapons

14:52.285 --> 14:53.565
to achieve your objectives.

14:53.745 --> 14:54.943
True, Your Excellency.

14:55.121 --> 14:59.450
However, the only tool
diplomacy has is language.

15:00.084 --> 15:03.916
It is of the utmost importance
that the meaning be crystal clear.

15:04.089 --> 15:08.133
Your Excellency,
I am basically a scientist.

15:08.301 --> 15:12.133
Clarity of formulation
is essential in my profession also.

15:12.305 --> 15:13.800
I am glad to hear it.

15:13.974 --> 15:15.966
Perhaps you could then
make greater effort

15:16.143 --> 15:19.975
to choose your words
more precisely.

15:20.647 --> 15:22.142
You don't let him get away with that.

15:22.316 --> 15:25.067
No matter what you say, Mr. Spock,
he'll twist your meaning.

15:25.235 --> 15:27.477
Yes, he's infuriating, sir.
How can you stand it?

15:27.655 --> 15:30.490
We cannot leave without being
absolutely sure ourselves

15:30.658 --> 15:31.903
that everything has been done.

15:32.076 --> 15:34.614
Now, certainly you understand
our feelings about that.

15:34.787 --> 15:38.619
- Mr. Spock? Mr. Spock?
- Yes, Your Excellency.

15:38.791 --> 15:41.496
- Are you still there?
- Yes, Your Excellency.

15:41.669 --> 15:44.242
There was interference
with your transmission.

15:44.422 --> 15:47.043
A lot of noise drowned out
what was said.

15:47.216 --> 15:48.497
Would you repeat, please?

15:48.676 --> 15:51.843
I apologise for the noise,
Your Excellency.

15:52.013 --> 15:56.011
To summarise, I request permission
to transport down to Gideon.

15:56.184 --> 15:57.347
Forgive me, Mr. Spock.

15:57.519 --> 16:00.354
No criticism of your equipment
was intended.

16:00.522 --> 16:03.807
But it has sent your captain
on some strange journey,

16:03.984 --> 16:05.264
a safe one, we all still hope.

16:05.443 --> 16:09.441
But it could create for us serious
incidents with your Federation.

16:09.614 --> 16:13.315
And now you propose to repeat
this disaster with another officer?

16:13.493 --> 16:14.692
This would be madness.

16:14.870 --> 16:17.539
I'll not take that, Mr. Spock.

16:17.706 --> 16:19.913
That transporter
was in perfect condition.

16:20.084 --> 16:21.708
I guarantee that myself.

16:21.877 --> 16:24.166
Transport me down
and I'll prove to those...

16:26.465 --> 16:27.496
...gentlemen.

16:27.675 --> 16:29.383
Mr. Scott, you'll go
to the Transporter Room

16:29.552 --> 16:30.583
and await my orders.

16:30.761 --> 16:31.876
Aye, Mr. Spock.

16:36.225 --> 16:38.514
I could not quite make that out,
Mr. Spock.

16:38.686 --> 16:41.391
Would you be so good
as to repeat what you said?

16:41.564 --> 16:42.809
Yes, Your Excellency.

16:42.982 --> 16:46.731
The ship's engineer was explaining
that the malfunction,

16:46.903 --> 16:49.311
which did exist,
has now been repaired.

16:49.489 --> 16:52.443
We would appreciate
an opportunity to test the equipment.

16:52.617 --> 16:54.242
I therefore request permission

16:54.411 --> 16:56.487
to beam down
to your council chamber.

16:56.663 --> 16:58.739
But, Mr. Spock, you...

16:58.915 --> 17:02.747
Your Excellency,
grant this one request.

17:02.919 --> 17:06.252
You are a very persistent fellow,
Mr. Spock.

17:09.510 --> 17:11.667
Very well, then.

17:11.845 --> 17:17.088
You shall test the skill
of your very excitable repairman.

17:17.268 --> 17:18.762
There is one proviso.

17:18.935 --> 17:21.473
We cannot risk further incidents.

17:21.646 --> 17:25.810
You will therefore transport
a member of my staff to your ship.

17:25.984 --> 17:27.563
Let us first see if that works.

17:27.737 --> 17:32.363
Thank you, Your Excellency.
Your proposal is accepted.

17:34.786 --> 17:36.363
- Mr. Scott?
- Scott here.

17:36.537 --> 17:39.408
Prepare to beam aboard
a representative of the Gideon Council.

17:39.582 --> 17:40.614
Aye, aye, sir.

17:40.792 --> 17:43.117
My assistant will provide you
with the proper...

17:43.294 --> 17:44.493
What is the word?

17:44.671 --> 17:46.295
Coordinates.

17:46.464 --> 17:49.382
Thank you. Proceed, Krodak.

17:53.221 --> 17:56.139
- Eight-seven-five.
- Eight-seven-five.

17:56.308 --> 17:59.641
- Zero-two-zero.
- Zero-two-zero.

17:59.811 --> 18:04.639
- Seven-zero-nine.
- Seven-zero-nine.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.809
Energizing.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.912
Mr. Spock, the gentleman
from Gideon is here.

18:24.086 --> 18:27.456
Your Excellency,
your assistant has arrived safely

18:27.632 --> 18:30.301
and I am now ready
to transport down to Gideon.

18:30.468 --> 18:34.217
Now, now, not so fast, Mr. Spock.

18:34.389 --> 18:36.298
That is quite a different matter.

18:36.474 --> 18:41.017
We agreed to allow one representative
on our soil, your captain.

18:41.187 --> 18:44.853
Sir, our captain is still missing,

18:45.025 --> 18:50.019
and I now demand that I be allowed
to transport to Gideon as we agreed.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.024
Forgive me, Mr. Spock,

18:52.199 --> 18:56.197
but I overstepped my authority
when I made that agreement.

18:56.370 --> 18:59.490
However, your request
will be taken up

18:59.665 --> 19:02.832
at the next full session
of Gideon's council.

19:11.385 --> 19:14.007
Mr. Scott, beam down
the gentleman from Gideon.

19:14.180 --> 19:17.715
Yes, Mr. Spock. I'm sending him
straight to the same coordinates.

19:19.060 --> 19:20.851
And just when I was
beginning to think

19:21.020 --> 19:23.392
you might find a whole new career
as a diplomat, Mr. Spock.

19:23.564 --> 19:25.853
Do not give up hope, doctor.

19:26.025 --> 19:28.314
Lieutenant Uhura,
contact Starfleet Command.

19:28.486 --> 19:30.728
Demand an immediate reply
to our request

19:30.905 --> 19:32.565
for permission to beam down
to Gideon.

19:32.741 --> 19:34.899
Yes, Mr. Spock.

19:35.076 --> 19:37.235
Enterprise to Starfleet Command.

19:37.412 --> 19:39.239
Enterprise to Starfleet Command.

19:39.790 --> 19:41.747
Enterprise to Starfleet Command.

19:41.917 --> 19:44.871
Enterprise to Starfleet Command.

19:45.045 --> 19:49.672
Captain Kirk here.
Red priority. Red priority.

19:49.842 --> 19:52.511
- Isn't it in working order?
- It seems to be.

19:52.678 --> 19:54.920
Then someone should have heard you.

19:55.097 --> 19:58.217
Captain Kirk here.
Please answer red priority.

19:58.392 --> 20:01.808
Please answer red priority.

20:02.605 --> 20:07.018
If someone is listening,
they're not answering.

20:07.193 --> 20:09.232
Why should they do that?

20:12.073 --> 20:13.900
They wouldn't.

20:23.126 --> 20:25.451
- What did you do?
- Took the ship out of warp speed.

20:25.628 --> 20:27.954
- Out of what?
- Space terminology.

20:28.131 --> 20:30.669
We're no longer moving
faster than the speed of light.

20:30.842 --> 20:33.464
I've trimmed down to sublight speed
until we find out where we are.

20:33.637 --> 20:37.006
- It feels the same.
- Of course it does.

20:40.018 --> 20:42.011
Maybe it is the same.

20:49.820 --> 20:52.145
Well, has the ship slowed down?

20:55.826 --> 20:59.278
If you can believe that, we have.

20:59.455 --> 21:03.535
Please. Don't tell me
the sky is out of order now.

21:10.008 --> 21:12.546
It's so quiet.

21:12.719 --> 21:15.126
So peaceful.

21:15.305 --> 21:17.381
It isn't really, you know.

21:26.149 --> 21:28.438
And it's beautiful.

21:33.532 --> 21:36.402
Yes. Yes, it is.

21:36.577 --> 21:38.534
Very, very beautiful.

21:38.704 --> 21:40.862
And we're alone.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.246
Can you make it last a long, long time?

21:43.417 --> 21:46.204
How long would you like it to last?

21:47.505 --> 21:49.378
Forever.

21:49.715 --> 21:51.044
Well, let's see.

21:51.217 --> 21:54.716
Power, that's no problem.
It regenerates.

21:54.887 --> 21:59.882
And food, we have enough to feed
a crew of 430 for five years.

22:00.059 --> 22:02.550
- So that should last us...
- Forever.

22:04.230 --> 22:06.804
All my life I've dreamed
of being alone.

22:06.983 --> 22:08.726
Most people are afraid
of being alone.

22:08.902 --> 22:11.190
Where I come from,
people dream of it.

22:12.405 --> 22:14.065
Why?

22:14.240 --> 22:15.735
Why are the people
of Gideon like that?

22:17.077 --> 22:18.191
Gideon?

22:20.080 --> 22:24.541
I told you I don't know where
I come from, what my planet is.

22:26.587 --> 22:29.588
- It might be Gideon.
- Does it matter so much?

22:29.756 --> 22:31.251
Yes.

22:31.425 --> 22:33.501
It might help me
pinpoint our location.

22:35.846 --> 22:37.554
And then you might find your crew.

22:37.723 --> 22:41.887
Being here with you,
I forgot there must be others.

22:42.478 --> 22:45.514
I envy you your sense of loyalty.

22:46.065 --> 22:49.399
I want to ease your feeling of dread,

22:49.569 --> 22:53.068
your fear that all your crew
no longer exists.

23:01.873 --> 23:05.705
I've got to contact
whoever's manipulating us.

23:05.877 --> 23:07.786
There must be a way.

23:09.548 --> 23:11.208
Odona.

23:11.383 --> 23:14.337
Odona, can you remember

23:14.511 --> 23:16.634
why your people
dream of being alone?

23:19.474 --> 23:21.052
Because they never can be.

23:22.811 --> 23:24.471
Why?

23:28.525 --> 23:30.732
What makes it so impossible
to be alone?

23:33.489 --> 23:36.988
Because there are so many of us.
So many.

23:37.827 --> 23:40.069
There is no place,

23:40.454 --> 23:41.617
no street,

23:41.789 --> 23:44.743
no house, no garden,

23:44.917 --> 23:46.162
no beach,

23:46.335 --> 23:49.705
no mountain
that is not filled with people.

23:49.881 --> 23:52.253
Each one of us would kill

23:52.425 --> 23:55.877
in order to find a place
alone to himself.

23:57.222 --> 23:58.846
They would willingly die for it

24:00.558 --> 24:02.516
if they could.

24:09.526 --> 24:11.685
Who sent you here?

24:12.863 --> 24:17.192
No one commands Odona.
I was not sent here.

24:20.704 --> 24:22.697
You've come to kill.

24:27.586 --> 24:29.330
Odona,

24:30.297 --> 24:31.460
have you come to die?

24:34.385 --> 24:37.386
I don't know. I don't care.

24:38.723 --> 24:41.178
I only know I'm here.

24:41.351 --> 24:43.758
I only know I'm happy.

25:25.438 --> 25:27.845
Now all I have to do
is find a medical kit

25:28.024 --> 25:30.775
and I can completely cure this.

25:30.943 --> 25:34.277
- Cure?
- Yes, the irritation would be gone.

25:34.447 --> 25:37.234
What will happen
if you do not find one?

25:37.408 --> 25:39.116
Will you become sick and die?

25:39.285 --> 25:42.203
Oh, no. Not from something
as simple as this.

25:42.372 --> 25:45.657
No, it'll cure itself eventually, but...

25:49.754 --> 25:54.463
Do you know, I don't even remember
how this happened.

25:58.388 --> 26:00.464
Do you hear that?

26:00.641 --> 26:05.137
Yes, it sounds like an engine.

26:05.312 --> 26:09.606
No, the ship's engines
don't make that kind of sound.

26:09.775 --> 26:12.978
But something is wrong
with the equipment. Could that be it?

26:13.154 --> 26:16.404
I know every sound
that this ship might make.

26:17.992 --> 26:20.198
That's coming from outside.

26:21.037 --> 26:24.203
- A storm might...
- A storm might.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.830
But you wouldn't be able to hear it.

26:29.379 --> 26:30.921
Come on.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.172
This is a viewing port.
We'll be able to see outside.

26:40.348 --> 26:43.598
If there's a storm,
we'll be able to see it.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.561
If it works.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.661
People.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.454
The faces of people.

27:06.083 --> 27:08.788
And then the stars.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.957
What's happening?

27:16.135 --> 27:17.629
What's out there?

27:26.563 --> 27:27.891
The sound is gone.

27:30.066 --> 27:32.308
It was like the heartbeat
of all those people

27:33.069 --> 27:36.521
and thousands upon thousands more
pressing against the ship.

27:39.326 --> 27:42.031
But you said
we were moving through space.

27:42.746 --> 27:43.909
Yes, I said that.

27:44.081 --> 27:46.951
Then the people can't be out there.

27:47.125 --> 27:48.205
Yes, they can.

27:49.086 --> 27:50.545
Please don't frighten me.

27:55.426 --> 28:00.088
It could be a mirage.
They could exist in our minds.

28:00.264 --> 28:02.173
You mean that we're going mad.

28:04.935 --> 28:09.229
Or some power is creating
the illusion in our minds

28:09.398 --> 28:12.186
that we are somewhere
near your planet.

28:16.614 --> 28:17.943
But why?

28:19.284 --> 28:21.276
I don't know.

28:22.996 --> 28:25.285
I don't know.

28:32.714 --> 28:34.292
I think I have an idea.

28:36.051 --> 28:38.293
So that we won't keep trying
to find out where we are,

28:38.470 --> 28:41.341
that we'll be content to stay here.

28:42.516 --> 28:44.805
Be content.

28:46.437 --> 28:49.141
Be content?

28:49.315 --> 28:51.521
Be content?

28:52.443 --> 28:54.270
Not until I find out
what happened to my crew.

28:54.445 --> 28:56.319
- Are they dead?
- I don't know.

28:56.489 --> 28:59.359
Did you kill them
so you could have the ship to yourself?

29:00.743 --> 29:02.285
Captain...

29:04.622 --> 29:09.249
Captain, something
is happening to me.

29:09.877 --> 29:13.496
I never felt like this before.

29:13.673 --> 29:16.342
I've never felt like this before either.

29:16.509 --> 29:20.175
Is this the way one looks

29:20.347 --> 29:24.179
when one is developing a sickness?

29:26.561 --> 29:29.515
There's no sickness on your planet,
remember?

29:34.611 --> 29:38.194
Now there will be.
There will be sickness.

29:40.451 --> 29:43.321
There will be death.

30:22.077 --> 30:24.449
- Hodin.
- Yes, Captain Kirk.

30:24.621 --> 30:27.373
Our experiment
has passed the first stage.

30:27.541 --> 30:30.458
Let me in there. I can help her.

30:30.627 --> 30:33.083
We have no need
of any of your medicines.

30:33.255 --> 30:34.418
But she's ill.

30:34.590 --> 30:38.006
We're grateful to you for her illness.

30:38.177 --> 30:39.755
You have done well, my daughter.

30:48.646 --> 30:50.555
Guard the captain well.

30:50.731 --> 30:53.436
We shall need him for a long time.

31:09.543 --> 31:11.286
I sympathise deeply,

31:11.461 --> 31:14.795
but Starfleet cannot override
Federation directives in this matter.

31:14.965 --> 31:17.800
Admiral, the crew
will not understand it.

31:17.968 --> 31:21.800
Has your crew suddenly become
interested in provoking a war?

31:21.972 --> 31:23.550
That is not Starfleet's mission.

31:24.141 --> 31:26.976
We wish only
to save the life of the captain.

31:27.144 --> 31:29.220
You have not proved your case
to the Federation,

31:29.396 --> 31:31.188
or to Starfleet for that matter.

31:31.357 --> 31:34.808
I am positive that I can do so
to your satisfaction, admiral.

31:34.985 --> 31:38.734
I have been convinced since
my first exchange with the ambassador

31:38.906 --> 31:40.982
that the captain
has been taken prisoner.

31:41.158 --> 31:42.902
Granted as fact, Mr. Spock.

31:43.077 --> 31:45.782
I now know
where the captain is being held.

31:45.955 --> 31:49.704
If he is being held at the same place
to which we transported him.

31:49.876 --> 31:52.912
They would not dare harm him
in the Gideon council chamber.

31:53.087 --> 31:57.963
Sir, the captain is not being held
in the Gideon council chamber.

31:58.134 --> 31:59.463
He is being held nearby.

31:59.636 --> 32:01.878
You have now answered
what and where.

32:02.055 --> 32:04.593
I am waiting
for your explanation of why.

32:04.766 --> 32:07.304
Since the planet is shielded
from our sensors,

32:07.477 --> 32:10.846
we cannot establish that
without on-the-spot investigation.

32:11.023 --> 32:13.229
Do you have evidence
the captain's life is threatened?

32:16.528 --> 32:17.691
Permission denied.

32:17.863 --> 32:20.484
Admiral, I wish to state
for the record

32:20.658 --> 32:22.864
that your decision
is completely arbitrary.

32:23.035 --> 32:24.862
So noted.

32:30.084 --> 32:32.456
Will it last long?

32:33.296 --> 32:37.128
That depends on the strength
of the one infected.

32:37.717 --> 32:40.386
You have great strength.

32:41.637 --> 32:45.386
How will you know
when I am to die?

32:45.558 --> 32:48.643
Your body temperature
will be very great.

32:48.812 --> 32:50.721
You will see us,

32:50.897 --> 32:52.557
but you will not know
who we are.

32:52.732 --> 32:54.891
I must see him before then...

32:55.068 --> 32:57.226
Lie still. Lie still.

33:02.826 --> 33:04.404
Do you feel great pain?

33:05.454 --> 33:07.031
Yes.

33:07.748 --> 33:10.868
In my arms and thighs.

33:11.043 --> 33:13.581
What is it like to feel pain?

33:15.339 --> 33:17.213
It is like...

33:19.593 --> 33:24.801
Like when you see the people
have no hope for happiness, Father.

33:25.808 --> 33:28.643
You feel great despair.

33:28.811 --> 33:30.970
And your heart is heavy

33:31.147 --> 33:34.101
because you know
you can do nothing.

33:34.567 --> 33:36.227
Pain is like that.

33:37.987 --> 33:40.941
Your courage gives me great pride.

33:54.004 --> 33:56.921
- Let me see her.
- Not yet.

33:57.090 --> 33:59.463
- You don't know what she may have.
- But we do.

33:59.635 --> 34:01.461
She has Vegan choriomeningitis.

34:03.263 --> 34:06.467
It's very rare and always fatal
if not treated within 24 hours.

34:06.642 --> 34:07.887
I know. It almost killed me.

34:08.060 --> 34:11.263
Yes, our prime minister learned
about you during our negotiations.

34:11.438 --> 34:13.312
That's why we brought you here.

34:13.482 --> 34:15.808
Your blood provided
the microorganisms

34:15.985 --> 34:17.976
which infected her.

34:18.154 --> 34:19.731
That's how my arm got hurt.

34:19.905 --> 34:21.649
Yes. As Odona told you,

34:21.824 --> 34:24.065
we have no need
for medical practitioners here.

34:24.243 --> 34:25.821
Our apologies.

34:25.995 --> 34:28.665
We were unforgivably awkward
to have hurt you.

34:42.554 --> 34:43.585
You're mad.

34:44.222 --> 34:47.176
No, we are desperate.

34:48.768 --> 34:51.853
I don't understand how Starfleet
can deny us permission

34:52.022 --> 34:54.393
to beam down
to search for the captain.

34:54.565 --> 34:56.938
They did not ask
for our understanding, doctor.

34:57.110 --> 34:58.902
I don't see how they expect us
to sit here

34:59.071 --> 35:00.862
and wait for the captain to reappear.

35:01.031 --> 35:03.949
Unfortunately, I must violate
a direct order from Starfleet.

35:04.118 --> 35:06.691
That's the best possible decision
you can make. I'm with you.

35:06.871 --> 35:08.780
I do not make it lightly, doctor.

35:08.956 --> 35:11.578
However, Command knows
that Ambassador Hodin

35:11.751 --> 35:13.957
has not been totally honest with us.

35:14.128 --> 35:19.086
Lieutenant Uhura, repeat original
Gideon coordinates for beam down.

35:19.258 --> 35:24.051
875-020-079.

35:24.222 --> 35:26.298
Mr. Scott,
the coordinates given you?

35:26.474 --> 35:31.551
875-020-709.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.224
Coordinates don't match.

35:34.316 --> 35:36.474
Precisely. I shall beam down at once.

35:36.651 --> 35:37.980
Mr. Scott, you have the conn.

35:38.153 --> 35:40.822
I'll pick up my medical tricorder,
meet you in the Transporter Room.

35:40.989 --> 35:42.982
Negative, doctor.
I cannot accept the responsibility

35:43.158 --> 35:46.242
for ordering a fellow officer
to violate a Starfleet directive.

35:46.411 --> 35:48.867
I can make such a decision
only for myself.

35:49.039 --> 35:51.411
I'm not asking you
to make the decision for me.

35:51.583 --> 35:54.869
The situation forces me
to do so, doctor.

35:55.045 --> 35:58.165
Well, in that case, it's the worst
possible decision you can make, Spock.

35:59.133 --> 36:00.924
This will not take long.

36:05.640 --> 36:10.266
Isn't that just about
what Captain Kirk said before he left?

36:31.291 --> 36:35.953
Captain Kirk, Spock here.
Captain Kirk?

37:03.741 --> 37:06.659
Your report to the Federation
was a tissue of lies.

37:06.828 --> 37:10.161
You described environmental,
physical, cultural conditions

37:10.331 --> 37:12.407
that would make Gideon a paradise.

37:12.584 --> 37:14.660
And so it was.

37:14.836 --> 37:19.249
A long, long time ago,
what we described was true.

37:19.424 --> 37:22.923
The atmosphere on Gideon
has always been germ-free,

37:23.094 --> 37:24.423
and the people flourished

37:24.596 --> 37:28.095
in their physical
and spiritual perfection.

37:28.266 --> 37:32.264
Eventually,
even the lifespan increased.

37:32.437 --> 37:36.934
Death became
almost unknown to us.

37:37.109 --> 37:41.189
It occurred only when the body
could no longer regenerate itself,

37:41.363 --> 37:44.863
and that happens now
only to the very old.

37:45.034 --> 37:47.869
Those are conditions
most people would envy.

37:48.037 --> 37:50.872
But Gideon did not find it enviable.

37:51.040 --> 37:55.287
The birthrate continued to rise
and the population grew

37:55.461 --> 37:59.874
until now Gideon
is encased in a living mass,

38:00.049 --> 38:04.877
who can find no rest,
no peace, no joy.

38:05.889 --> 38:09.721
Why haven't you introduced
any of the new techniques

38:09.893 --> 38:11.553
to sterilize men and women?

38:11.728 --> 38:15.512
Every organ renews itself.
It would be impossible.

38:15.690 --> 38:17.101
Then let your people learn

38:17.275 --> 38:19.945
about the devices
to safely prevent conception.

38:20.112 --> 38:22.400
The Federation will provide
anything you need.

38:22.572 --> 38:24.115
But, you see,

38:24.283 --> 38:27.319
the people of Gideon
have always believed

38:27.494 --> 38:30.246
that life is sacred.

38:31.123 --> 38:36.414
That the love of life
is the greatest gift.

38:36.962 --> 38:41.589
That is the one unshakeable truth
of Gideon.

38:41.759 --> 38:44.760
This overwhelming love of life

38:44.929 --> 38:48.677
has developed
our regenerative capacity

38:48.850 --> 38:50.889
and our great longevity.

38:51.060 --> 38:53.682
And the great misery
that you now face.

38:53.855 --> 38:56.642
That is bitterly true, captain.

38:56.816 --> 39:01.110
Nevertheless, we cannot deny
the truth which shaped our evolution.

39:01.279 --> 39:04.066
We are incapable
of destroying or interfering

39:04.240 --> 39:08.452
with the creation of that
which we love so deeply.

39:08.620 --> 39:13.780
Life, in every form,
from foetus to developed being.

39:13.959 --> 39:18.455
It is against our tradition,
against our very nature.

39:20.132 --> 39:22.089
We simply could not do it.

39:22.259 --> 39:24.133
Yet you can kill a young girl.

39:24.303 --> 39:28.965
We are trying to readjust the life cycle
of an entire civilisation.

39:29.141 --> 39:31.264
You're killing your own daughter.
How can you do that?

39:31.435 --> 39:35.729
My daughter hoped to make you feel
the agony of Gideon.

39:35.981 --> 39:37.974
But it was impossible.

39:38.150 --> 39:45.067
No stranger could realise
the horror that life can be here.

39:45.241 --> 39:48.159
I will not beg for your understanding
of my personal grief,

39:48.328 --> 39:52.112
nor will I parade it for you
to gain your cooperation.

39:52.290 --> 39:57.795
My love for my daughter
is too deep for display.

39:58.463 --> 40:00.503
My pride in her runs even deeper.

40:00.674 --> 40:04.458
My daughter freely chose
to do what she is doing,

40:04.636 --> 40:08.586
as the people of Gideon
are free to choose.

40:10.851 --> 40:14.516
The virus you need is very rare.

40:14.688 --> 40:15.851
Who will provide it?

40:18.901 --> 40:22.768
You will stay. Your blood will provide it.

40:22.947 --> 40:24.690
No, sir. Not me.

40:24.865 --> 40:26.525
You have many methods
available to you.

40:26.700 --> 40:27.981
I have mentioned only a few.

40:29.787 --> 40:31.827
I do not offer my life
for this purpose.

40:31.998 --> 40:33.706
I have many plans.

40:33.874 --> 40:38.204
And I have hopes
other than death for Odona.

40:38.379 --> 40:41.713
My daughter
pleaded with you to stay.

40:41.883 --> 40:47.304
What was said and what happened
between us was for us alone.

40:48.139 --> 40:52.054
She hoped you would love her
and wish to stay.

40:52.227 --> 40:54.385
So that was your plan.

40:55.105 --> 40:58.723
That I would fall so under her spell,

40:58.900 --> 41:00.893
that I would give up my freedom

41:01.611 --> 41:04.067
and become a willing sacrifice.

41:05.574 --> 41:08.409
Stay with us. We're desperate.

41:18.003 --> 41:19.498
Odona's fever is rising.

41:21.340 --> 41:23.831
She is calling
the name of James Kirk.

41:27.263 --> 41:29.884
You see, you cannot leave us now.

41:33.811 --> 41:34.891
Go to her.

42:06.595 --> 42:11.553
An exact duplicate of the Enterprise.

42:20.276 --> 42:23.147
But completely inoperative.

42:39.462 --> 42:43.081
Spock to Enterprise.
Spock to Enterprise.

42:43.258 --> 42:44.503
Scott here, Mr. Spock.

42:44.676 --> 42:47.843
I am speaking to you
from the Bridge of the Enterprise.

42:49.848 --> 42:51.093
You're where?

42:51.266 --> 42:54.849
On the Bridge of the Enterprise,
Mr. Scott.

42:55.020 --> 42:57.511
Those were the coordinates
you insisted on.

42:57.689 --> 42:59.516
And they were correct.

42:59.692 --> 43:03.641
I'm onboard an exact duplicate
of the Enterprise.

43:04.613 --> 43:07.448
An exact duplicate
of the Enterprise?

43:07.616 --> 43:09.360
Is it in orbit, Mr. Spock?

43:09.535 --> 43:12.026
In orbit, doctor.

43:12.204 --> 43:14.078
In a manner of speaking,

43:14.248 --> 43:17.867
Gideon is in orbit,
and the ship is on Gideon.

43:18.878 --> 43:21.962
Well, that's a beginning.
What about the captain?

43:22.131 --> 43:24.587
I'm sure he's onboard somewhere.

43:24.759 --> 43:28.258
I'm picking up life readings.
Spock out.

43:28.888 --> 43:32.554
Ship's log, stardate 5423.8.

43:32.726 --> 43:34.268
First Officer Spock reporting.

43:34.436 --> 43:37.057
Obviously, the Gideons
have transported Captain Kirk

43:37.230 --> 43:39.472
onto this replica of the Enterprise

43:39.649 --> 43:41.309
to so confuse his mind

43:41.485 --> 43:45.185
as to make him susceptible
to some extraordinary experiment.

43:45.364 --> 43:47.570
It is my intention
to locate the captain

43:47.741 --> 43:51.609
and warn him before the experiment
reaches its conclusion,

43:51.787 --> 43:53.032
which logic indicates

43:53.205 --> 43:57.203
means the end of the captain's life
as he knows it.

44:05.718 --> 44:07.794
If you don't allow me
to bring Dr. McCoy down here,

44:07.970 --> 44:10.259
it'll soon be too late
to do anything for her.

44:10.431 --> 44:13.349
We have told you,
it is her wish and mine

44:13.518 --> 44:16.353
that there be no interference
with the natural progress of the virus.

44:16.521 --> 44:18.348
Her death is unnecessary.

44:18.523 --> 44:20.432
Even if she lives,
her blood will provide

44:20.608 --> 44:22.601
the same serum you need
as mine would.

44:23.737 --> 44:26.821
No, her death at so young an age

44:26.990 --> 44:28.449
will let the people know for certain

44:28.617 --> 44:31.155
that our life cycle can be changed.

44:31.328 --> 44:35.622
It is the symbol that will bring forth
the dedicated young volunteers.

44:35.791 --> 44:40.785
The serum in their new blood
will change Gideon,

44:40.963 --> 44:43.632
and it will once more
be the paradise it was.

45:07.240 --> 45:09.778
I'm glad that you're here.

45:11.411 --> 45:13.569
Is the time short?

45:15.331 --> 45:17.158
Very short.

45:19.044 --> 45:23.041
And I asked you to make
our journey last forever.

45:27.511 --> 45:29.503
It began here.

45:31.390 --> 45:33.762
And it can continue.

45:35.477 --> 45:40.685
If only you will allow me,
I can cure you.

45:41.233 --> 45:43.142
I am not afraid of what will happen.

45:44.528 --> 45:47.198
It is just that now

45:47.364 --> 45:51.362
I wish with all my heart
to stay with you forever.

46:33.871 --> 46:35.828
Your Excellency.

46:35.998 --> 46:37.278
Captain, you're looking well.

46:37.458 --> 46:39.913
Evidently, Starfleet's analysis
was correct.

46:40.085 --> 46:42.162
Mr. Spock, we have a patient
for Dr. McCoy.

46:42.338 --> 46:44.295
Have Scotty beam us up.

46:45.508 --> 46:48.758
Spock to Enterprise.
Spock to Enterprise.

46:48.928 --> 46:52.379
- Scott here.
- Three to beam up, Mr. Scott.

46:52.557 --> 46:53.885
Same coordinates?

46:54.058 --> 46:56.217
Negative. Lock in
on my communicator signal.

46:58.813 --> 47:01.898
Your Excellency,
please do not interfere.

47:02.066 --> 47:07.274
I already have one serious problem
to resolve with upper echelons.

47:26.884 --> 47:29.920
Well, it was close, but you made it.

47:30.596 --> 47:32.505
I am cured?

47:32.681 --> 47:35.517
Right. Just like the captain.

47:39.897 --> 47:42.768
Instead of smiling at me,
you should be shouting in anger.

47:42.942 --> 47:44.982
Why, because you're well again?

47:46.195 --> 47:49.647
No, because I pretended to be...

47:52.619 --> 47:56.319
How can you bear to look at me
after the way I deceived you?

47:56.498 --> 48:00.827
At least you owe me the privilege
of letting me look at you.

48:07.175 --> 48:09.168
You are a gentleman, Captain Kirk.

48:10.887 --> 48:11.919
Thank you, ma'am.

48:12.097 --> 48:14.884
You are no longer needed
on Gideon.

48:15.058 --> 48:16.850
I can take your place there.

48:19.021 --> 48:20.349
Is that what you want to do?

48:23.108 --> 48:25.896
That is what I must do.

48:26.070 --> 48:27.861
I am needed there now.

48:33.077 --> 48:36.197
You're needed everywhere, Odona.

48:49.094 --> 48:50.588
It is not like our ship.

48:50.762 --> 48:53.929
Yes, it is. It's exactly the same.
Only this one works.

48:54.099 --> 48:57.384
- It goes to many other planets?
- Yes, it goes to the whole galaxy.

48:57.561 --> 48:59.767
With another difference.

48:59.938 --> 49:02.014
This one is crowded.

49:02.190 --> 49:04.598
It seems crowded to you?

49:05.527 --> 49:07.271
It does now.

49:09.656 --> 49:11.898
Are you going to stay on the ship?

49:13.786 --> 49:15.363
Yes, Odona, I have to.

49:17.998 --> 49:20.489
As crowded as my planet is,

49:20.668 --> 49:24.084
I could wish for it
to hold one more person.

49:28.509 --> 49:30.051
Kirk to Transporter Control.

49:30.219 --> 49:33.220
One to beam down
to the planet Gideon.

49:36.434 --> 49:39.554
I will miss you, Captain James Kirk.
