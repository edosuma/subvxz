'My name is Friedrich Hirsch.
I was born in Berlin in 1935.

00:12.285 --> 00:15.684
'When the Jews
were sent to the ghettoes,

00:15.685 --> 00:19.684
'I was given false papers
and adopted by a German family.

00:21.765 --> 00:25.764
'Shortly afterwards, my parents
were sent to the labour camps.

00:26.205 --> 00:29.604
'I was never to see them again.

00:29.605 --> 00:31.144
'My adoptive parents

00:31.150 --> 00:35.109
'were terrified
that I would be found out.

00:35.110 --> 00:37.789
'Everyday they said to me,

00:37.790 --> 00:40.589
"Say nothing."

00:40.590 --> 00:42.829
"Do nothing."

00:42.830 --> 00:45.429
'I smiled and I saluted

00:45.430 --> 00:47.509
'and I did...

00:47.510 --> 00:49.469
'nothing,

00:49.470 --> 00:51.229
'as everyone I knew

00:51.230 --> 00:55.069
'was murdered.

00:55.070 --> 00:59.069
'But now,
I have a chance to change that.

01:00.510 --> 01:04.509
'I am going to travel through time
and kill Adolf Hitler.

'If I fail,

01:08.750 --> 01:12.109
'I wanted whoever finds this letter

'I did... something.'

05:10.270 --> 05:11.509
What's going on?

05:11.510 --> 05:13.789
I seen them
arresting people on the estate.

05:13.790 --> 05:15.949
They're rounding up
people with powers.

05:15.950 --> 05:17.069
What then?

05:17.070 --> 05:18.149
Fuck knows.

05:32.550 --> 05:35.589
What's this? I said it had to be
done alphabetically.

05:35.590 --> 05:37.549
Since when did "J" come before "H"?

05:37.550 --> 05:39.629
If I'm so crap,
why'd you give me the job?

05:39.630 --> 05:42.309
Because you have other talents.

05:42.310 --> 05:43.749
Oh, yeah...

05:43.750 --> 05:47.589
you are very, very talented.

05:47.590 --> 05:50.349
You mean I've got nice tits?

05:50.350 --> 05:54.349
Yeah.

06:01.710 --> 06:03.789
Whatever.

06:03.790 --> 06:06.309
You said to let you know
when the prisoner arrived.

06:06.310 --> 06:10.309
He's here.

06:11.430 --> 06:14.709
The old man we found
with the stab wound on the estate,

06:14.710 --> 06:16.669
he had this in his pocket.

06:16.670 --> 06:20.669
Well, put it with the other shit!

06:31.270 --> 06:34.709
Morning.

06:34.710 --> 06:37.509
What d'you want with me?

06:37.510 --> 06:40.029
Oh, I think you know
what we want from you.

06:40.030 --> 06:41.389
Cos if you didn't,

06:41.390 --> 06:44.229
we wouldn't have found you
being smuggled off the estate

06:44.230 --> 06:47.149
in the boot of a car.

06:47.150 --> 06:49.349
You'd have taken the bus...

06:49.350 --> 06:53.069
like a normal person.

06:53.070 --> 06:57.069
Now... you're going to test
some people

06:57.350 --> 07:00.589
to see if they've got
one of these powers.

07:00.590 --> 07:04.189
If they have,
you're going to take it off 'em

07:04.190 --> 07:08.189
and you're going to stick it in
whoever I tell you to stick it in.

07:08.910 --> 07:10.349
Got it?

07:10.350 --> 07:11.429
Right.

07:11.430 --> 07:15.429
Let's get started!

07:25.430 --> 07:29.429
Hands.

07:39.230 --> 07:43.229
Next!

07:50.310 --> 07:54.309
Hands.

07:54.470 --> 07:58.469
Give him your hand.

08:16.630 --> 08:17.789
Bingo!

08:17.790 --> 08:20.589
Right, take her for questioning.

08:20.590 --> 08:23.629
You've got what you want from me!
Just let me go!

08:23.630 --> 08:27.629
Next!

09:10.910 --> 09:12.109
What d'you know?

09:12.110 --> 09:15.189
There's this guy. They've got him
at the community centre.

09:15.190 --> 09:19.189
They're using him
to take people's powers.

09:42.150 --> 09:43.509
What's wrong with him?

09:43.510 --> 09:46.949
He was stabbed.

09:46.950 --> 09:49.469
I think his wound's infected.

09:49.470 --> 09:53.469
Can't you take him to a hospital?

09:54.150 --> 09:56.149
Nazis aren't big on compassion.

09:56.150 --> 09:57.949
Aren't you one of them?

09:57.950 --> 10:01.949
I was conscripted.

10:03.710 --> 10:07.709
I'll do what I can for him.

10:13.750 --> 10:16.069
They're going to find us!

10:16.070 --> 10:18.869
No! They're not going to find us,
cos I have a plan.

10:18.870 --> 10:20.349
We're going to Mum and Dad's.

10:20.350 --> 10:21.469
What?!

10:21.470 --> 10:24.269
They're our parents...
legally obliged to hide us.

10:24.270 --> 10:27.549
Oh, yes, cos I am sure
they are dying to get involved!

10:27.550 --> 10:31.549
Last time Dad seen you,
he called you a... "Little cunt!"

10:33.990 --> 10:35.149
They fucking love me.

10:35.150 --> 10:35.689
Do they?

10:35.844 --> 10:37.163
Yes. They worship me.

10:37.210 --> 10:38.329
In fact, sometimes,

10:38.337 --> 10:42.036
I think Mum loves me er... too much!

10:43.057 --> 10:47.056
Now get back in here,
we're going to go.

10:59.097 --> 11:00.296
Stay where you are!

11:00.297 --> 11:01.816
Fuck!

11:01.817 --> 11:03.256
Stop or we'll shoot!

11:03.257 --> 11:07.256
I said stay where you are!

11:16.057 --> 11:18.496
This guy,
who's taking people's powers...

11:18.497 --> 11:20.936
you said you deliver food
to the cells?

11:20.937 --> 11:24.936
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.
They've got me working my arse off!

11:32.297 --> 11:34.176
We need you to put this in his food.

11:34.177 --> 11:35.296
What is it?

11:35.297 --> 11:37.336
You really need me to tell you?

11:37.337 --> 11:39.296
I ain't killing him.

11:39.297 --> 11:41.256
He's a prisoner.
He's not one of 'em!

11:41.257 --> 11:42.296
It's not personal.

11:42.297 --> 11:45.256
Killing someone?!
To me, that's fuckin' personal!

11:45.257 --> 11:48.616
The Nazis are using him to take
people's powers for themselves.

11:48.617 --> 11:52.616
When they get them, they're going
to use them against us.

11:57.697 --> 12:06.056
We can't let that happen.

12:23.657 --> 12:27.656
What are you doing?

12:29.137 --> 12:31.416
There's an old man in the cells.

12:31.417 --> 12:35.416
His wound's infected.
He needs antibiotics.

12:38.297 --> 12:40.976
Do you know what they'll do
to you if they find you here?

12:40.977 --> 12:44.976
Shit!

12:46.457 --> 12:48.536
What's going on?

12:48.537 --> 12:50.256
He was helping with the computer.

12:50.257 --> 12:54.256
You know how shit I am
with these things.

12:54.657 --> 12:56.576
Yeah, she is particularly shit.

12:56.577 --> 12:57.616
I missed you.

12:57.617 --> 12:59.936
Yeah? I only went for a piss.

12:59.937 --> 13:02.376
I can still miss you, can't I?

13:02.377 --> 13:06.376
See the effect I have on women.

13:22.857 --> 13:26.856
Sit down.

13:33.457 --> 13:35.896
What about them Nazis, hey?

13:35.897 --> 13:39.576
What about them?

13:39.577 --> 13:43.576
Very bossy.

13:44.377 --> 13:47.616
You're not taking the bait at all.

13:47.617 --> 13:51.616
You're making me
come out and say it.

13:55.497 --> 13:58.616
Are you part of the resistance?

13:58.617 --> 14:02.616
Oh! I'll take that as a yes.

14:02.737 --> 14:05.896
Good. It's nice to meet you, mate.

14:05.897 --> 14:07.336
Who are you?

14:07.337 --> 14:11.336
I've got one of them bullshit
powers. The Nazis are after me.

14:12.137 --> 14:16.136
Show me. Do it.

14:54.097 --> 14:57.496
Captain Smith.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.096
I was just, er...

14:59.097 --> 15:01.456
It looked like
you were smoking a cigarette?

15:01.457 --> 15:05.456
I was thinking about
how best to organise our operations

15:07.257 --> 15:11.256
and to maximise efficiency
and productivity.

15:12.937 --> 15:14.776
I'll look forward to that.

15:14.777 --> 15:17.136
Right.

15:17.137 --> 15:20.456
I understand you've caught the man
we've been looking for.

15:20.457 --> 15:24.456
We most certainly have. Please...

15:28.937 --> 15:32.936
Move.

15:44.137 --> 15:48.136
So, I hear you've been doing
good work for us.

15:49.177 --> 15:53.176
Is that what you call it?

15:54.017 --> 15:55.536
How does this work?

15:55.537 --> 15:59.536
Oh, he's got to touch you.

16:06.977 --> 16:10.976
You know I can make
life very unpleasant for you.

16:36.737 --> 16:40.736
You're all done.
Like taking candy from a baby.

16:44.017 --> 16:48.016
You've missed a patch.

16:49.137 --> 16:53.136
We can't keep this man
locked in a dirty cell.

17:07.696 --> 17:11.695
Just there.

17:29.777 --> 17:33.776
That's very good.

17:57.457 --> 18:01.456
You got a cigarette?

18:13.097 --> 18:15.216
You don't smoke, do you?

18:15.217 --> 18:17.696
What gave it away?

18:17.697 --> 18:19.816
I don't smoke either.

18:19.817 --> 18:23.816
Why should
the smokers get all the breaks?

18:29.897 --> 18:33.896
I never got a chance to thank you,
for covering for me.

18:38.617 --> 18:42.616
Why are you with him?

18:44.097 --> 18:47.136
I got caught drink driving.

18:47.137 --> 18:51.136
They were going
to send me to prison.

18:51.297 --> 18:55.296
He got them to drop the charges.

18:58.697 --> 19:02.456
You probably think I'm a total slut.

19:02.457 --> 19:06.456
We're all doing
what we need to do to survive.

20:03.617 --> 20:07.616
He's fucking hung himself!

20:08.217 --> 20:11.336
Open the fucking door!

20:11.337 --> 20:15.336
Come on!

20:21.097 --> 20:22.896
I can't hold him. Untie it!

20:22.897 --> 20:25.536
I'm trying!

20:25.537 --> 20:29.136
Come on!

20:48.697 --> 20:52.136
You go in there to kill him
and you end up saving his life?

20:52.137 --> 20:54.376
Just explain to me
exactly how that happens.

20:54.377 --> 20:56.816
I couldn't kill him.
He was trying to kill himself.

20:56.817 --> 20:59.056
Then you leave him to it. Job done.

20:59.057 --> 21:03.056
He'd have hung himself rather than
let those bastards have the powers.
He's on our side.

21:03.337 --> 21:06.656
That's no good to us
if the Nazis have got him.

21:06.657 --> 21:10.656
We missed our shot.
We might not get another.

21:10.657 --> 21:13.136
Hmm, now then.

21:13.137 --> 21:17.136
That's just like the, er, story
of the tortoise and the hare. Eh?

21:21.857 --> 21:25.856
Or is it the owl and the pussy cat?

21:25.977 --> 21:29.096
Something about a lion and dog?

21:29.097 --> 21:33.096
Two in the hand is worth...

21:33.417 --> 21:36.856
one in the bush, isn't it?

21:36.857 --> 21:38.336
Stop stealing the alcohol.

21:38.337 --> 21:40.256
I thought you said
to just help myself?

21:40.257 --> 21:42.896
I said stay the fuck
away from the bar.

21:42.897 --> 21:45.016
Yeah.

21:45.017 --> 21:49.016
You go back to the community centre
and you call me if anything happens.

21:56.337 --> 21:59.056
It was a mistake to treat him
like a prisoner.

21:59.057 --> 22:01.856
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

22:01.857 --> 22:05.856
We need to make him see the benefits
of working for us.

22:06.457 --> 22:09.456
Perhaps he won't be so hostile
once he's sampled

22:09.457 --> 22:13.176
all the privileges we can give him.

22:13.177 --> 22:15.496
I could get him a prostitute?

22:15.497 --> 22:19.496
I think it might take
a little bit more than that.

22:20.057 --> 22:23.656
Two prostitutes?

22:23.657 --> 22:27.336
That was a joke.

22:27.337 --> 22:30.936
It was very funny.

22:30.937 --> 22:34.936
Yeah.

22:40.217 --> 22:42.336
I'm not hungry.

22:42.337 --> 22:46.336
I made you jelly and ice cream.

22:50.977 --> 22:54.296
I thought it'd be easy to swallow,
you know,

22:54.297 --> 22:57.376
like they give you in hospital
when you have your tonsils out.

22:57.377 --> 23:01.376
It's raspberry.

23:13.817 --> 23:14.816
You're dribbling.

23:14.817 --> 23:16.136
That's attractive.

23:16.137 --> 23:20.136
Here you go.

23:20.497 --> 23:22.216
I suppose I should get used
to this.

23:22.217 --> 23:26.216
Apparently they're moving me
to a more luxurious prison.

23:40.817 --> 23:44.816
What the fuck is that?

23:47.377 --> 23:51.096
'Convoy is halted, I repeat,
convoy is halted in sector one.'

23:51.097 --> 23:52.416
Come on.

23:54.577 --> 23:58.576
Oi. Get them out of the road!

24:20.257 --> 24:21.536
Shit, get down!

24:21.537 --> 24:22.816
Down! Down! Drive, go!

24:29.217 --> 24:33.216
Fuck! Stay down.

24:46.297 --> 24:50.296
Fuck this!

25:03.017 --> 25:07.016
You?

25:07.017 --> 25:08.056
Hiya.

25:08.057 --> 25:12.056
Hiya.

25:13.297 --> 25:17.296
Stay down.

25:23.697 --> 25:27.696
They knew we were moving him.

25:29.937 --> 25:32.096
And someone tipped them off!

25:32.097 --> 25:33.936
Well, don't look at me.

25:33.937 --> 25:36.096
I was lucky to get
out of there alive.

25:36.097 --> 25:40.096
And exactly how is it that you
managed to escape from this ambush?

25:41.257 --> 25:44.056
I'm very agile.

25:44.057 --> 25:48.056
Like a cat.

25:52.017 --> 25:55.736
And what about you?

25:55.737 --> 25:59.736
Sitting there, tip tapping away
on your little computer.

26:01.217 --> 26:04.936
Maybe you're not as stupid
as you look.

26:04.937 --> 26:08.496
I can freeze your blood
just like that.

26:08.497 --> 26:11.736
Actually, she is as stupid as she
looks. She hasn't got the brains

26:11.737 --> 26:13.376
to pull something off like this.

26:13.377 --> 26:17.136
Tear up the estate
until you find him.

26:17.137 --> 26:21.136
I'm holding you
personally responsible.

26:25.937 --> 26:28.096
I'll see what I can do, yeah.

26:28.097 --> 26:32.096
We will see, won't we?

26:33.417 --> 26:37.416
Fuck.

26:39.737 --> 26:41.736
There's roadblocks
all over the estate.

26:41.737 --> 26:43.416
You'll have to stay here tonight.

26:43.417 --> 26:46.056
Tomorrow, we'll see about
moving you to a safe house.

26:46.057 --> 26:50.056
Keep your voices down,
and stay out of sight.

27:12.817 --> 27:14.096
Where am I?

27:14.097 --> 27:17.176
You're in prison.

27:17.177 --> 27:21.176
You need to get some rest.

27:24.057 --> 27:27.536
This is all wrong.

27:27.537 --> 27:29.896
None of this should have happened.

27:29.897 --> 27:33.176
Take these.

27:33.177 --> 27:37.176
Get some sleep.

27:45.697 --> 27:49.696
So what's the story with your power?

27:49.817 --> 27:52.816
I started off just dealing
a bit of gear to mates.

27:52.817 --> 27:55.936
It took off from there.

27:55.937 --> 27:59.936
After a while,
I was dealing to the dealers.

28:00.097 --> 28:04.096
It's addictive... the buzz... staying
one step ahead of the police.

28:10.057 --> 28:14.056
I wanted to be the ultimate dealer.

28:14.617 --> 28:17.336
Then the storm hit.

28:17.337 --> 28:21.336
I guess I got my wish.

28:24.257 --> 28:28.256
I never thanked you for...

28:28.777 --> 28:31.696
saving my life.

28:31.697 --> 28:35.696
You shouldn't be thanking me
for anything.

28:36.177 --> 28:38.416
I was going to kill you.

28:38.417 --> 28:42.416
We had to stop the Nazis
from getting the powers.

28:43.217 --> 28:47.216
I put poison in your food.

28:48.097 --> 28:51.376
Well, why did you save me?

28:51.377 --> 28:55.376
When I saw you hanging there,
I just couldn't do it.

29:03.817 --> 29:07.816
Sorry I tried to kill you, yeah?

29:09.617 --> 29:11.056
I'm glad you didn't.

29:11.057 --> 29:14.416
I guess I've got a soft spot
for suicide cases.

29:14.417 --> 29:15.656
A tart with a heart.

29:15.657 --> 29:17.416
Who are you calling a fuckin' tart?

29:17.417 --> 29:19.296
No. I didn't mean...

29:19.297 --> 29:23.296
Well, you're not...

29:48.057 --> 29:52.056
They're here!

29:55.177 --> 29:59.176
What?

30:13.177 --> 30:14.776
What's going on?

30:14.777 --> 30:17.896
What do you think? It's a raid.

30:17.897 --> 30:18.936
Who are you?

30:18.937 --> 30:20.776
I work here.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.576
And you?

30:22.577 --> 30:25.536
Er, I am his...

30:25.537 --> 30:28.376
gay lover.

30:28.377 --> 30:31.736
I'm the giver, he's the taker.

30:31.737 --> 30:35.736
I'm the butch, he's the bitch.

30:35.937 --> 30:38.856
I'm the sausage, he's the muffin!

30:38.857 --> 30:41.736
You're aware that homosexuality
is illegal?

30:41.737 --> 30:44.576
Oh, I were joking.

30:44.577 --> 30:48.576
Cos er... he's me cousin, from me...

30:49.217 --> 30:51.176
Shut the fuck up.

30:51.177 --> 30:55.176
You, and you...

31:13.017 --> 31:17.016
Clear, sir.

31:18.817 --> 31:22.816
Well, go on, piss off!

31:43.657 --> 31:45.176
Right,

31:45.177 --> 31:49.176
I reckon you've got about three
seconds before I empty my gun

31:49.897 --> 31:53.896
into this floor.

31:57.577 --> 32:01.576
One...

32:02.457 --> 32:04.456
Two...

32:09.457 --> 32:11.336
Cosy down there, is it?

32:11.337 --> 32:15.336
Come on.

32:25.137 --> 32:26.549
Go!

33:08.410 --> 33:09.489
It's you.

33:09.490 --> 33:13.489
Do I know you?

33:26.930 --> 33:30.929
'My name is Friedrich Hirsch.
I was born in Berlin in 1935.'

33:34.370 --> 33:37.289
I wanted to change history.

33:37.290 --> 33:41.209
You gave me the power.

33:41.210 --> 33:45.209
'But now I have a chance
to change that.'

33:46.730 --> 33:49.889
We were fighting.

33:49.890 --> 33:53.249
My phone fell out of my pocket.

33:53.250 --> 33:57.129
Hitler... he picked it up.

33:57.130 --> 34:01.129
The Nazis... they used
the technology in the phone.

34:01.850 --> 34:03.289
It changed everything.

34:03.290 --> 34:07.289
'I am going to travel through
time and kill Adolf Hitler.'

34:11.489 --> 34:15.489
I think you'd better read this.

34:15.810 --> 34:18.889
The Nazis weren't supposed
to win the war.

34:18.889 --> 34:22.889
This isn't supposed to happen.

34:26.570 --> 34:30.569
Take the power.
I'm too weak to do anything with it.

34:31.810 --> 34:35.809
You have to put it right.

34:41.929 --> 34:45.929
Take it.

34:58.730 --> 35:02.729
Open up!

35:12.850 --> 35:16.489
So you have the power?
And now, you can put it back in him.

35:16.490 --> 35:18.369
He's just taken it out of him.

35:18.370 --> 35:21.569
We can't afford for anyone
to have this power.

35:21.570 --> 35:25.569
Too much could change.
It dies with the old man.

35:26.090 --> 35:30.089
I won't do it.

35:38.850 --> 35:42.849
Shoot him.

35:44.890 --> 35:48.889
Shoot the old man.

35:54.690 --> 35:58.689
Take out your side arm,
and shoot him.

35:59.370 --> 36:03.369
That is a direct order!

36:11.730 --> 36:15.729
Take your fucking gun out
and shoot him!

36:38.570 --> 36:42.569
Get him out.

36:47.730 --> 36:49.489
Take your fucking hands off me.

36:49.490 --> 36:53.489
Leave him alone!

36:56.370 --> 37:00.369
Put the power in him.

37:02.610 --> 37:06.609
I will shoot
every person in these cells

37:08.810 --> 37:11.289
until you do as I say.

37:11.290 --> 37:13.369
Don't do it.

37:13.370 --> 37:17.369
I'm sorry.

37:31.730 --> 37:35.729
And that's the end of that.

37:54.050 --> 37:57.809
I heard what happened. Are you OK?

37:57.810 --> 38:00.529
They shot them.

38:00.530 --> 38:03.129
Right in front of me.

38:03.130 --> 38:06.329
I just stood there.

38:06.330 --> 38:07.729
I did nothing.

38:07.730 --> 38:11.729
There's nothing you could have done.

38:19.490 --> 38:23.489
What's wrong?

38:24.130 --> 38:28.129
Everything.

38:49.930 --> 38:53.929
You all right, mate?

39:03.130 --> 39:07.129
You fucking shot me!

39:12.650 --> 39:13.929
What're you doing?

39:13.930 --> 39:17.929
Busting prisoners out of the cells.
I'll kill whoever gets in the way.

39:18.290 --> 39:22.289
D'you need a hand?

39:24.090 --> 39:25.169
I'm with her.

39:25.170 --> 39:28.409
You're shagging him?
I thought you liked me?

39:28.410 --> 39:30.369
All you did was make me hate myself.

39:30.370 --> 39:32.249
Ungrateful bitch. After all I did.

39:32.250 --> 39:33.729
Will you shoot him again?

39:33.730 --> 39:37.129
When we're done with him,
you can do what you like.

39:37.130 --> 39:41.129
Move!

39:47.050 --> 39:48.969
Get us out of here!

39:48.970 --> 39:50.929
Hi. Where's Curtis?

39:50.930 --> 39:54.929
He's... he's dead.

40:04.090 --> 40:06.569
This old guy had the power
to travel through time.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.529
He tried to kill Hitler.
But he failed.

40:08.530 --> 40:11.449
There's another version of history.
The Nazis lost.

40:11.450 --> 40:13.089
You kidding?

40:13.090 --> 40:17.089
It's locked.

40:28.850 --> 40:32.849
You're completely surrounded,
so I suggest you drop your weapons.

40:33.130 --> 40:35.689
Get behind me. They won't shoot me.

40:35.690 --> 40:38.729
Give it up.

40:38.730 --> 40:42.369
We just want him.
The rest of you are free to go.

40:42.370 --> 40:44.969
No, I'm pretty sure he's lying.

40:44.970 --> 40:48.289
Of course he's fucking lying.

40:48.290 --> 40:52.289
Grenade!

40:52.730 --> 40:56.729
Fuck!

41:28.650 --> 41:31.489
We're surrounded!

41:31.490 --> 41:35.489
He's hit! Hold on.
We'll get you out of here.

41:51.970 --> 41:55.969
Tear gas!

42:03.290 --> 42:06.209
Stay with me.

42:06.210 --> 42:10.049
I faked it.
I didn't put the power in Curtis.

42:10.050 --> 42:11.169
I've still got it.

42:11.170 --> 42:13.569
Get the phone.

42:13.570 --> 42:15.009
What phone?

42:15.010 --> 42:19.009
Hitler. Get the phone.

42:30.570 --> 42:34.569
No. You're not allowed to die!

43:08.970 --> 43:12.209
Oi, Hitler.

43:12.210 --> 43:16.209
Fraulein?

43:18.330 --> 43:21.649
Why have you got to be such a dick?

43:21.650 --> 43:25.649
Wache! Wache!

44:06.370 --> 44:09.849
So, me and you fought the Nazis?
And I died?

44:09.850 --> 44:13.849
They shot you.

44:17.810 --> 44:21.809
In this...
alternative version of history...

44:23.810 --> 44:27.089
me and you, did we...?

44:27.090 --> 44:31.089
Did we shag? No.

44:31.690 --> 44:33.689
You kissed me when
you gave me the power.

44:33.690 --> 44:37.209
Did I? And how was that?

44:37.210 --> 44:41.209
It was all right.

44:45.010 --> 44:47.889
So I want this bullshit
rewind power out of me.

44:47.890 --> 44:49.569
I am done fucking with history.

44:49.570 --> 44:52.649
You have to promise me
you won't let anyone else have it.

44:52.650 --> 44:54.249
Promise, yeah?

44:54.250 --> 44:58.249
I don't want to die, so I'll put
in my pet iguana for safekeeping.

44:59.970 --> 45:03.969
I never had you down as someone
who'd have a pet lizard.

45:04.050 --> 45:07.369
Yeah, well, there's a lot
you don't know about me.

45:07.370 --> 45:09.409
I know you're not
who you make out to be.

45:09.410 --> 45:12.889
You act like you don't give
a shit about anyone. That's rubbish.

45:12.890 --> 45:16.889
So what d'you want instead?

45:16.930 --> 45:20.929
I kind of liked being
a fuckin' rocket scientist.

45:28.690 --> 45:32.089
What the fuck are you looking at?

45:32.090 --> 45:36.089
Nothing.

45:38.810 --> 45:40.329
Where have you been?

45:40.330 --> 45:44.329
Just been fighting the fuckin' Nazis
and kicking the shit out of Hitler.

45:53.410 --> 45:54.649
What's he doing here?

45:54.650 --> 45:57.049
Do you think he's here
to take our powers?

45:57.050 --> 45:59.609
What's up with Kelly?
She's seeing someone else?

45:59.610 --> 46:01.489
Just fuck off and stop following me!

46:01.490 --> 46:04.089
Check again, Kelly Bailey.
Five foot five, medium build.

46:04.090 --> 46:05.129
She's in hospital?

46:05.130 --> 46:07.809
We were going for a drink.
It could have been nothing.

46:07.810 --> 46:11.809
But what if she liked me?
What if we were good together?

46:11.834 --> 46:17.134
