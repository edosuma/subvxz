♪♪

00:08.209 --> 00:11.610
Jax Von Hapsburg,
fighter of evil, is here.

00:13.214 --> 00:17.282
Fear me, bad guys,
fear me... bad.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.356
You're number one
best bro',

00:24.358 --> 00:26.525
Max Van Pluto,
is by your side.

00:27.995 --> 00:30.029
We will rid the city
of Santa Luego

00:30.031 --> 00:31.363
of its evildoers.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.132
(both grunt)

00:33.134 --> 00:36.368
Josh and I are making
a Jax Von Hapsburg movie

00:36.370 --> 00:37.669
because we're
both in L.A.,

00:37.671 --> 00:39.671
and frankly
the public demanded it.

00:39.673 --> 00:42.408
Okay, just a few
hard-core fans--

00:42.410 --> 00:44.243
Okay, we wanted it.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.313
(in Spanish accent)
Jax and Max!

00:48.315 --> 00:49.748
(dismissive laugh)

00:49.750 --> 00:52.217
You will never defeat
evil, super villain

00:52.219 --> 00:55.054
Lisa De Los Ray-Eyes!

00:56.257 --> 00:59.324
Joey asked me to play
Lisa De Los Ray-Eyes,

00:59.326 --> 01:03.395
but I was super busy
so I convinced him to hire mom.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.665
(Spanish accent)
I would have nailed that role.

01:06.667 --> 01:10.502
Santa Luego
belongs to me!

01:12.239 --> 01:14.073
No one is safe

01:14.075 --> 01:17.409
from my powerful
laser-eye blast!

01:17.411 --> 01:19.344
Well, do your worst,

01:19.346 --> 01:22.081
Lisa De Los-Ray-Eyes.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.652
Pew, pew!

01:27.955 --> 01:29.021
Cut! Mom!

01:29.023 --> 01:30.522
What was that?

01:30.524 --> 01:32.758
Well, that was my
menacing laser-eye blast.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.427
Yeah, it was?
'Cause you looked more like
a constipated chicken.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.896
Oh.

01:37.897 --> 01:40.364
Come at us
with the burning hatred
of a thousand suns.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.934
A thousand suns, okay.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.368
And action!

01:46.140 --> 01:48.540
Pew pew!
(heavy breathing)

01:50.711 --> 01:52.544
Cut.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.080
Okay, so that was
a chicken pirate.

01:55.082 --> 01:58.083
Well, okay.
What kind of chicken
do you want?

01:58.085 --> 01:59.618
No kind of chicken!

01:59.620 --> 02:00.819
Josh:
Okay, okay,
let's-- let's--

02:00.821 --> 02:03.222
-Let's take a break.
-Okay, yeah, you're right.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.290
-What's for lunch?
-Oh, I made chicken.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.459
I can't work like this!

Great day
of filming today, Joey.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.049
Aww.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.319
(both groan)

03:07.321 --> 03:09.521
Oh, look at the time.

03:09.523 --> 03:13.358
How about we take
our action-hero appetites
to Quesadilla Joe's, huh?

03:13.360 --> 03:16.128
Josh and I hang out
on Wednesdays and Fridays

03:16.130 --> 03:17.696
when Maddie has
basketball practice.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.531
Josh took the break-up hard,

03:19.533 --> 03:22.668
so if they were
to run into each other,
it would be so awkward.

03:22.670 --> 03:25.470
Maddie also has
basketball practice
on Mondays,

03:25.472 --> 03:28.540
but that is when I make
my artisanal soaps.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.977
(inhales deeply)
Hmm, sandalwood, oh.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.548
Okay, I'm home
because practice was canceled.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.883
(door closes)

03:37.885 --> 03:39.384
Josh?!

03:39.386 --> 03:42.588
-Maddie!
-Josh and Maddie!

03:43.557 --> 03:45.891
The couple formerly
known as Mosh.

03:45.893 --> 03:50.495
Hey, I have not seen you
since you moved to California.

03:50.497 --> 03:51.597
Dude, what is up?

03:51.599 --> 03:53.665
I'm filming Joey's movie.
Didn't he tell you?

03:53.667 --> 03:56.868
No.
No, he did not.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.905
Okay, well...
(uncomfortable chuckle)

03:59.907 --> 04:02.274
this has been
a super-special reunion,

04:02.276 --> 04:05.444
but let's get out of here
before things get awkward.

04:05.446 --> 04:08.247
Why-- why would
things get awkward?

04:08.249 --> 04:09.881
We were friends
before we dated,

04:09.883 --> 04:11.216
and no reason
we can't be friends now.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.118
Yeah, totally.
I mean, really the only thing

04:13.120 --> 04:15.954
that's awkward here
is that you two are wearing
action pajamas.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.725
-Ah, you totally burned us.
-Yeah.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.627
-Nice.
-(both laugh)

04:21.629 --> 04:23.528
Really,
you guys are cool?

04:23.530 --> 04:25.631
Yes, totally!

04:25.633 --> 04:27.866
Hey, Joey and I are heading
to Quesadilla Joe's.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.134
Do you want to come?

04:29.136 --> 04:30.969
Well, we'll change
out of our action pajamas.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.438
Oh, no, it's totally fine.
You guys can come in those.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.640
(both gasp) Really?

04:34.642 --> 04:36.008
No, get upstairs and change.

04:46.553 --> 04:50.088
Well, well, well, Parker,
you're here after school.

04:50.090 --> 04:53.058
So you're entering
Mars Madness.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.493
Good for you.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.261
Too bad I'm gonna win.

04:56.263 --> 04:59.598
Your confidence is amusing,
but misplaced.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.634
You're looking
at the winner right here.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.471
Mars Madness
is a national competition

05:06.473 --> 05:08.473
sponsored by
a space exploration company

05:08.475 --> 05:10.275
whose goal is to colonize Mars.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.978
(sighs)
Parker Rooney, King of Mars.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.914
It's got a nice ring to it.

05:15.916 --> 05:19.117
The winner gets to spend
a year in a bio-dome

05:19.119 --> 05:21.420
with the same
conditions as Mars.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.655
And if you do well,
you could one day

05:23.657 --> 05:26.425
be among the first humans
to live on Mars.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.728
Val Wishart, Queen of Mars.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.932
Got a nice ring to it.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.867
Check it out.
I'm creating a plant

05:35.869 --> 05:37.536
that can survive
on a Mars colony.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.538
I took the genes
of a nutrient-dense avocado

05:39.540 --> 05:41.973
and spliced them
with the genes of a cactus

05:41.975 --> 05:43.709
for its ability to thrive
with little water.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.278
I call it
the Cacti-cado!

05:48.349 --> 05:51.717
Well, I made a serum
with the DNA of a Venus flytrap

05:51.719 --> 05:53.652
It'll make plants
so aggressive

05:53.654 --> 05:56.021
they'll fight
to survive anywhere!

05:56.023 --> 05:59.124
It's kind of cool,
but does it have
a catchy name

05:59.126 --> 06:01.727
like Cacti-cado?

06:01.729 --> 06:05.964
I call it the Apex Predator
Agricultural Death Swarm!

06:05.966 --> 06:10.102
But you're right,
Cacti-cado is super cute.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.172
Why did I underestimate Val?

06:14.174 --> 06:16.074
She draws me in
with that smile,

06:16.076 --> 06:17.876
then slams me down
with that brain!

06:17.878 --> 06:20.545
Oh, was I smiling?

06:21.749 --> 06:23.548
I didn't notice.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.717
My Cacti-cado
needs to spend a weekend

06:25.719 --> 06:27.552
at the same temperature
as the Mars bio-dome,

06:27.554 --> 06:29.988
exactly 24 degrees Celsius.

06:29.990 --> 06:34.159
Well, my serum needs
to be at 22 degrees Celsius.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.096
Well, since your project
needs all the breaks it can get

06:38.098 --> 06:39.564
to catch up to my genius,

06:39.566 --> 06:41.767
22 degrees it is.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.068
May the best brain win.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.237
(coughing)
It's me.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.810
-Val: Parker?
-Coming.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.690
(Maddie and Josh cheer)

07:05.692 --> 07:06.725
Nice work.

07:06.727 --> 07:07.926
Glad you came out
with us, Maddie.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.261
Yeah, dude, me too.

07:09.263 --> 07:10.595
This has been a blast.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.364
Who says you can't
be friends with your ex?

07:12.366 --> 07:13.598
Probably the same doubters

07:13.600 --> 07:15.634
who say you can't
build a pyramid out of nachos.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.937
Okay, I didn't say
we couldn't do it!

07:18.939 --> 07:21.106
I said I didn't
want to do it.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.408
Maddie:
Hey, guys, check it out.

07:23.410 --> 07:26.445
(barks like walrus)

07:26.447 --> 07:28.480
(laughing)
Churro walrus!

07:28.482 --> 07:29.781
Funniest thing ever!

07:29.783 --> 07:30.782
(both laughing)

07:30.784 --> 07:34.286
Last week, I made
a taquito triceratops

07:34.288 --> 07:37.689
and Josh said that
was the funniest thing ever!

07:38.759 --> 07:41.092
Well, which is it, Josh?!

07:41.094 --> 07:42.828
I'm getting more churros.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.463
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

07:44.465 --> 07:46.665
You're the best, Joshie!
(laughing)

07:46.667 --> 07:48.433
Stop trying
to out-bro' me!

07:48.435 --> 07:50.635
What?
Out-what you?

07:50.637 --> 07:52.771
Just stop
stealing my friend.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.139
Joey,
there's no reason

07:54.141 --> 07:55.640
that we both can't
be friends with Josh.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.678
Best idea ever-
churro porcupine.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.846
Help me stick these
to my back.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.514
(phone beeps)

08:04.251 --> 08:06.451
(gasps)
No way, you guys!

08:06.453 --> 08:09.754
Willow scored VIP tickets to
this Wednesday's Dodger game.

08:09.756 --> 08:10.822
Are you in?

08:11.758 --> 08:13.625
Ah, no.

08:13.626 --> 08:15.493
No, we're shooting
"Jax and Max"
on Wednesday.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.962
-Oh.
-Aw, come on, Joey.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.830
Can't we just shoot
the scene some other time?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.832
Sure, Josh.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.601
We'll just reschedule

08:22.603 --> 08:24.803
the most important scene
in the entire film.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.304
(laughs)
Awesome!
Thanks, Joey!

08:26.306 --> 08:27.939
-Yeah!
-(Josh laughs)

08:27.941 --> 08:29.541
Hey, check it out.
Wait, hold on.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.643
Churro-stache.

08:31.645 --> 08:34.846
Ah!
That's the funniest thing ever!

08:34.848 --> 08:36.448
(Maddie and Josh laugh)

08:36.450 --> 08:39.551
(hysterical laughs)

08:40.487 --> 08:41.786
(angry laughing)

08:46.493 --> 08:50.295
Oh, hey, Liv, uh,
I've got an emotional emergency.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.330
To get my best bro' back,

08:52.332 --> 08:54.900
I needed Liv's help,
so I was baiting the hook,

08:54.902 --> 08:58.937
which I'm told people
who aren't afraid of worms
do for fishing.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.040
Okay, well, um,

09:02.042 --> 09:04.910
Maddie and Josh
ran into each other

09:04.912 --> 09:06.711
for the first time
since the break up.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.413
Oh no!

09:08.415 --> 09:10.382
Uh, that must have
been so awkward.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.816
It was.

09:11.818 --> 09:14.352
Maddie feels compelled
to keep hanging out with him

09:14.354 --> 09:16.721
to prove that
it's not awkward.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.724
-Yeah.
-Uh, she's in
so much pain, Liv.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.860
Oh, well--
uh, you're her twin.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.529
So I'm sure you feel
that pain already.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.865
Joey, of course I feel it.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.500
I mean, I really--

09:28.502 --> 09:30.402
I did think that
it was last night's pizza,

09:30.404 --> 09:32.504
but it's clearly
Maddie's pain.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.206
I just wish Maddie
could find the strength

09:35.208 --> 09:36.775
to tell Josh
how she feels,

09:36.777 --> 09:39.411
but it's not
gonna happen unle--

09:40.681 --> 09:42.681
No, no, no, no.
It's too much to ask.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.916
-Forget it.
-No, no, no, wait, wait.
What's too much to ask?

09:47.788 --> 09:49.888
Well...
(chuckles)

09:49.890 --> 09:51.222
Maddie, uh--

09:51.224 --> 09:53.625
Maddie's afraid to say
what she needs to say,

09:53.627 --> 09:57.195
but I figured you could
pretend to be Maddie

09:57.197 --> 09:59.364
and say it for her.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.301
Whoa, um--

10:03.303 --> 10:05.437
I mean, Joey,
doing a switch-a-rooney

10:05.439 --> 10:08.573
without telling the other twin
is against the twin code.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.842
There's a twin code?

10:12.312 --> 10:13.478
I've said too much.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.815
Well, is there any part
of the twin code

10:16.817 --> 10:20.552
that allows you to break it
if your other twin really,
really needs it?

10:22.089 --> 10:24.322
-There isn't...
-Okay.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.957
but there should be.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.892
-Yay.
-Yay.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.461
I'm gonna do
a switch-a-rooney

10:29.463 --> 10:31.463
-for Maddie!
-Definitely for Maddie!

10:38.972 --> 10:41.306
Well, well, well.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.977
Look who's here
on a Saturday

10:45.979 --> 10:48.179
to check on his
Mars Madness project

10:48.181 --> 10:50.915
because he's nervous
I'm going to beat him.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.918
Oh, it is I who will be doing
the well, well, well-ing...

10:55.122 --> 10:57.122
because you're nervous
I'm gonna beat you

10:57.124 --> 10:58.690
and end up
in the Mars bio-dome.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.593
(scoffs)
Only if I bring a photo
of you with me.

11:02.596 --> 11:03.928
Not that I would do that.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.466
Okay, so it's agreed.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.835
Neither one of us
is nervous about our projects.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.007
-But we're still
gonna check, right?
-Uh, cha.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.847
(screeches)

11:22.849 --> 11:24.783
(screams)

11:26.219 --> 11:28.520
What happened
to my Cacti-cado?

11:28.522 --> 11:30.422
And why is it
so hot in here?

11:31.725 --> 11:34.125
Forty-two degrees Celsius?

11:34.127 --> 11:36.127
-How did that happen?
-(Parker groans)

11:36.129 --> 11:39.531
I must have punched in
42 instead of 24.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.633
You want to fly
a spaceship to Mars,

11:41.635 --> 11:42.967
but you can't work
a thermostat!

11:42.969 --> 11:44.803
It's a very complicated
thermostat!

11:48.008 --> 11:51.076
Oh no,
my growth serum
evaporated.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.677
And once
it became airborne,

11:52.679 --> 11:54.179
it mixed with
my Cacti-cado.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.580
That's what
made it ginormous.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.949
-(plant screeches)
-(screams)

11:59.686 --> 12:01.519
This thing is out of control.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.688
If it grows out of the lab,
we'll lose containment.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.490
I'm initiating
emergency protocol!

12:09.863 --> 12:12.530
<i>(alarm blares)</i>

12:12.532 --> 12:13.898
<i>(alarm continues)</i>

12:13.900 --> 12:16.568
Well, the good news is
it's not getting out.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.603
The bad news is
neither are we!

12:20.874 --> 12:23.041
We don't know what
this thing is capable of.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.242
We have to stop it.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.511
It's gonna take
all of our scientific ability.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.912
It might be impossible.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.018
You can say it.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.019
No, it should be you.

12:35.021 --> 12:36.454
You sure?

12:37.390 --> 12:38.690
Okay, thanks.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.259
Challenge accepted!

12:42.596 --> 12:44.129
-(screeches)
-(screams)

12:52.239 --> 12:54.873
Joey, Liv told me
that you asked her

12:54.875 --> 12:56.241
to do a switch-a-rooney
without me?

12:56.243 --> 12:57.609
What are you thinking?

12:57.611 --> 12:58.676
Don't kick me!

13:00.213 --> 13:02.080
(Liv's voice)
Joey, it's me you big dummy!

13:02.082 --> 13:03.915
-(laughs)
-(sighs)

13:03.917 --> 13:05.817
You forget that
I'm an actress.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.455
Okay, I am
so ready for this,

13:10.457 --> 13:12.390
I even bought some
fake glasses at the mall.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.759
Okay, so I told Josh

13:14.761 --> 13:16.895
that Maddie wanted
to meet up for nachos.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.997
Right, but really
I'm going to tell him

13:18.999 --> 13:21.099
that things are awkward
and I need some space.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.268
Hm-hmm, yeah,
I wrote a script
for you to follow.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.437
Oh, okay,
Joey, I don't think
I really need a script.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.906
Okay, trust me.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.675
That script is chock full of
bro'-friendly super-hero lingo

13:30.677 --> 13:33.077
to let Josh down easy.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.679
Nothing handles
emotional turmoil

13:34.681 --> 13:36.014
quite like comic books.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.917
Okay, well, I really
hope it's not over-written

13:38.919 --> 13:40.318
because my throat
has been killing me

13:40.320 --> 13:42.086
and Maddie's
bam-what's are not easy.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.355
Just say
♪ sing it louder ♪...

13:44.357 --> 13:46.157
(vocalizes)

13:46.159 --> 13:49.127
forty-seven
less times a day

13:49.129 --> 13:50.094
and your throat
should be fine.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.264
Hey, guys,
sorry I'm late.

13:53.266 --> 13:56.201
Who's ready for more
churro walrus? Whoo!

13:56.203 --> 13:57.836
(chuckling)

13:57.838 --> 14:02.473
(Maddie's voice)
Um, s'up, dude?
So we need to talk.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.109
Okay, what's going on?

14:05.111 --> 14:08.179
(clears throat)
Before you answer that, Maddie,

14:08.181 --> 14:09.981
I would take a look
at your menu.

14:09.983 --> 14:13.384
I'm sure you don't
have the whole thing
memorized quite yet.

14:16.156 --> 14:19.123
Um, yeah, it's-- it's--
you know,

14:19.125 --> 14:21.025
the world needs you...

14:22.028 --> 14:26.064
Josh, um, and the, uh,
needs of the many

14:26.066 --> 14:29.467
-they outweigh
the needs of the few.
-(Joey silent)

14:31.838 --> 14:34.239
Well, that's a classic
super-hero axiom,

14:34.241 --> 14:36.207
but I'm not sure
how it applies here.

14:37.644 --> 14:41.746
Uh, it's been really cool
hanging out with you again,

14:41.748 --> 14:43.581
but I just can't
do it any more.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.150
You know, you belong
to the day...

14:48.722 --> 14:52.056
and I belong to the night.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.728
And you cannot
come to the Dodger game,

14:56.730 --> 14:58.296
uh, because...

14:59.366 --> 15:00.765
it is at night.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.103
How dare you!

15:06.273 --> 15:09.574
You toy with this
young boy's emotions again?

15:09.576 --> 15:14.279
After he has been nothing--
nothing but a gentleman to you.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.548
Yeah, s--
(sighs)

15:17.550 --> 15:20.518
Sorry, but unlike Joey,

15:20.520 --> 15:21.753
I'm an awful...

15:23.256 --> 15:24.188
horrible person.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.193
I will go, and let
you two bros be bros.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.130
-(clears throat)
-Oh, uh...

15:33.600 --> 15:36.167
but first let me
pre-pay the check.

15:38.038 --> 15:41.205
Oh, well, Maddie,
it's the least you could do.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.240
The waiter's
right over there.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.141
Okay.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.279
-Hey, Josh.
-Maddie?

15:48.281 --> 15:49.614
Maddie! No!

15:52.052 --> 15:54.436
Why are you both
so surprised to see me?

15:54.437 --> 15:56.821
Josh just texted me
and said that we were
meeting for nachos.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.923
All right, you guys,
I paid the che--

15:58.925 --> 16:00.458
(nervous giggle)

16:00.460 --> 16:01.492
Liv?

16:01.494 --> 16:04.796
Okay, now I'm really confused.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.064
What's going on?

16:07.434 --> 16:08.633
She told me
that she didn't

16:08.635 --> 16:09.834
want to hang out
with me any more,

16:09.836 --> 16:11.269
but she was being you,

16:11.271 --> 16:12.904
so it was like
you were telling me,

16:12.906 --> 16:16.507
but you weren't
because you're you, not her.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.545
Did that clear it up?

16:21.514 --> 16:23.147
Maddie, I'm so sorry.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.983
I know that it's wrong
to pretend to be you,

16:24.985 --> 16:26.150
but Joey said
that you were hurting

16:26.152 --> 16:28.319
because of all the awkwardness
between you and Josh.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.687
Both: What awkwardness?

16:31.024 --> 16:32.857
I think we can all agree

16:32.859 --> 16:35.259
things are very awkward
at this moment.

16:36.930 --> 16:39.063
(awkward chuckle)

16:41.201 --> 16:42.533
It's ready.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.603
I call it Dr. P's
Tubes of Terror!

16:45.605 --> 16:46.938
Add the concentrated
weed killer.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.177
All filled up
with Val Venum!

16:55.148 --> 16:56.748
What? You're not the only one
who can name things.

16:58.618 --> 17:02.020
Okay, so if we can get the plant
to eat the Tubes of Terror,

17:02.022 --> 17:04.088
it will release
the Val Venum
and Boom!

17:04.090 --> 17:06.858
The Cacti-cado
will be cacti-dead-o.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.227
"Cacti-dead-o"?

17:09.229 --> 17:10.395
They can't all
be winners, okay?

17:13.633 --> 17:15.333
Just know that
by killing this

17:15.335 --> 17:17.301
we also kill
any chance we have

17:17.303 --> 17:18.669
of winning Mars Madness.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.371
I know.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.207
(cries)
Now I'll never know

17:22.208 --> 17:24.042
which direction
the toilet flushes
on the red planet.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.012
So how do we get that
in the plant's mouth?

17:28.014 --> 17:29.380
Watch and learn.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.227
And now we throw it
into the Cacti-cado's mouth?

17:43.229 --> 17:45.763
Throw it?
Please!

17:49.669 --> 17:51.536
Okay, now you're
just trying to impress me.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.404
Am I?
And are you?

18:08.688 --> 18:10.254
(slow motion screeches)

18:17.597 --> 18:20.298
Goal!

18:20.300 --> 18:22.500
(grumbling)

18:26.873 --> 18:28.372
(burps)

18:28.374 --> 18:30.308
Both: We did it!
We did it!

18:36.716 --> 18:39.217
You know,
when our projects combined,

18:39.219 --> 18:40.585
it was pretty impressive.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.287
Maybe we should work together
on a new project.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.389
If we work the rest
of the weekend,

18:45.391 --> 18:47.425
I'm sure we can come up
with something great.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.494
We make a good team.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.695
Team Pal.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.302
'Cause if you combine
Parker and Val--

18:58.304 --> 19:00.138
No, no, I get it.
It's just super dumb.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.044
Joey, why did
you do this?

19:08.648 --> 19:10.348
Okay, look.

19:11.918 --> 19:15.419
Guys, making friends
is kinda hard for me...

19:17.290 --> 19:19.891
but with Josh,
it was easy.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.493
I mean, whether--
whether we're laughing
about something stupid

19:22.495 --> 19:24.529
or sharing our love
for super heroes,

19:24.531 --> 19:26.364
or I'm watching him
change my flat bike tire--

19:26.366 --> 19:28.666
(giggles, snorts)

19:28.668 --> 19:31.202
(laughing)
You don't know how
to change a bike tire?

19:34.107 --> 19:36.407
Maddie, let's just--
Let's let him get through this.

19:37.443 --> 19:40.278
Josh, once Maddie
started hanging out with us,

19:40.280 --> 19:43.381
it kind of felt like
you'd rather just
hang out with her.

19:43.383 --> 19:46.918
Having you as my bro'
means a lot to me...

19:48.488 --> 19:50.688
'cause, Josh,
you're the best friend
that I've ever had.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.190
(coos)

19:54.327 --> 19:57.695
Joey, sometimes
the needs of the one

19:57.697 --> 19:58.496
outweigh the needs
of the Maddie.

20:02.368 --> 20:05.937
Did you just
read my script
or my mind?

20:07.907 --> 20:10.341
Maddie, it's been really fun
hanging with you again,

20:10.343 --> 20:11.742
but I can't go
to the game.

20:11.744 --> 20:15.479
Okay, um,
so that is Maddie.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.282
And I am Liv.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.586
Dang, this is confusing.

20:21.588 --> 20:22.920
(clears throat)

20:22.922 --> 20:25.590
-Maddie, I--
-You are not going
to the game.

20:25.592 --> 20:26.991
Right, oh, right.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.492
-Yeah, I heard you.
-Yeah, you heard that.

20:28.494 --> 20:29.994
-(chuckles)
-Uh, sorry, but...

20:31.397 --> 20:32.863
me and my best bro'
have a movie to shoot.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.665
Yeah, I totally get it.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.169
Go make the best,
worst action movie

20:38.171 --> 20:39.804
that anyone has ever seen.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.508
(both groan)

20:46.346 --> 20:48.646
Both:
♪ A-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo ♪

20:50.450 --> 20:51.949
Aw, it's so cute.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.986
-♪ A-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-- ♪
-Stop.

20:55.922 --> 21:00.424
Liv, an unauthorized,
one-sided switch-a-rooney?

21:00.426 --> 21:02.627
Oh, Maddie, I'm so sorry.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.129
How could I
make it up to you?

21:05.131 --> 21:06.864
You're gonna go
to the game with me.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.399
(gasps)

21:08.401 --> 21:09.967
(whines)
Maddie, no!

21:10.970 --> 21:12.770
Not sports-ball game going!

21:17.210 --> 21:19.644
<i>(heroic music plays)</i>

21:27.887 --> 21:30.821
(deep voice)
Justice just tumbled in.

21:32.759 --> 21:35.626
Jax, Max, attack!

21:35.628 --> 21:36.827
Both: Oh, yeah!

21:36.829 --> 21:38.329
Ha ha ha ha!

21:38.331 --> 21:39.964
No one is safe

21:39.966 --> 21:42.633
from my powerful
laser-eye blast!

21:48.808 --> 21:51.642
We're trapped, Jax.
What do we do?

21:51.644 --> 21:54.578
Only thing
we can do, Max:

21:54.580 --> 21:56.681
we die like brothers.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.785
(raspy voice)
Hey, Ray-Eyes.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.253
(gasps)

22:02.255 --> 22:04.255
Your optometrist called

22:04.257 --> 22:06.090
and gave you
a prescription

22:06.092 --> 22:07.858
for Falcon.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.360
(gasps)

22:11.597 --> 22:12.663
Falcon?

22:13.933 --> 22:16.067
I am no match
for Falcon.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.373
(deep voice)
Well, thanks for
saving us, Falcon.

22:22.375 --> 22:25.009
(raspy voice)
Santa Luego is safe.

22:27.547 --> 22:29.013
So says...

22:31.451 --> 22:32.516
Falcon.

22:32.518 --> 22:33.684
<i>(falcon screeches)</i>

22:50.670 --> 22:52.636
Whoo!
(laughs)

22:52.638 --> 22:55.005
Mrs. R, your ray eyes
were awesome!

22:55.007 --> 22:57.041
Oh, thank you.
<i>Gracias.</i>

22:58.678 --> 23:02.046
Wait, okay, Joey,
you played two parts?

23:02.048 --> 23:04.415
How is that
even like possible?

23:04.417 --> 23:08.219
Yeah, and also the voices
were like entirely different.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.587
Yeah, you know,

23:09.589 --> 23:11.522
everyone thinks
it's so hard, but...

23:11.524 --> 23:13.157
(as Falcon)
it's actually not that hard.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.763
-Pew pew!
-Aagh!
