WEBVTT

00:23.148 --> 00:24.441
<i>I enjoy funerals.</i>

00:24.524 --> 00:27.944
<i>I've been crashing them since I was</i>
<i>old enough to read the obituary section.</i>

00:29.446 --> 00:31.114
"God is our refuge and strength…"

00:31.197 --> 00:33.908
<i>Mayor Walker was murdered,</i>
<i>and I know the killer is here,</i>

00:34.659 --> 00:37.996
<i>standing innocently among us,</i>
<i>plotting their next move.</i>

00:39.122 --> 00:40.582
<i>And watching everything I do.</i>

00:43.293 --> 00:45.045
<i>I know I'm close to the truth.</i>

00:45.545 --> 00:47.130
<i>I have all the pieces of the jigsaw.</i>

00:48.673 --> 00:50.425
<i>I just need to slot them into place.</i>

01:27.504 --> 01:29.964
<i>I must look past the tears</i>
<i>and masks of grief.</i>

01:30.048 --> 01:33.176
<i>Until now, I may have been</i>
<i>outmatched and outmaneuvered,</i>

01:33.259 --> 01:35.512
<i>but the final gambit has yet to be played.</i>

01:37.806 --> 01:39.808
<i>The killer will make a mistake,</i>

01:41.142 --> 01:42.143
<i>and I'll be ready.</i>

02:17.679 --> 02:20.807
Still as sharp as ever,
my pig-tailed protégé.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.350
Uncle Fester.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.619
How long
have you been stalking me?

02:41.703 --> 02:45.123
Just blew into town this morning
and was hit by a wave of nostalgia.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.167
I thought you didn't go to Nevermore.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.919
I didn't. Your dad got all the brains.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.547
But I used to drop in on him.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.884
Usually from the ceiling
with a dagger clutched between my teeth.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.219
-Just to keep him on his toes.
-Of course.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.055
He filled me in on what's been going on.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.558
Monsters, murder, mayhem.

03:04.475 --> 03:05.643
What fun!

03:06.227 --> 03:09.939
I told him I had a job in Boston,
but I'd be checking up on you.

03:10.481 --> 03:11.691
What kind of job?

03:11.774 --> 03:14.736
The kind that means I need somewhere
to lay low for a couple days.

03:27.665 --> 03:29.250
This place belongs to a friend.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.921
You've actually made a friend.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.548
That poor kid
will be going home in a body bag.

03:36.674 --> 03:38.259
Oh.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.889
-I like a hideout that comes with snacks.
-Those bees are hibernating.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.974
They're practically Eugene's children.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.851
-Ooh.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.728
That means do not eat them!

03:54.859 --> 03:55.777
You know,

03:56.861 --> 03:59.572
when you give me
that death stare of disapproval,

03:59.656 --> 04:00.990
you remind me of your mother.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.201
Speaking of scary things,

04:03.701 --> 04:05.954
you know what kind of monster
you're dealing with?

04:06.037 --> 04:08.122
I haven't been able to identify it.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.084
Ooh.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.380
It's called a Hyde.

04:16.714 --> 04:17.715
As in Jekyll and Hyde?

04:17.799 --> 04:18.967
Mm-hmm.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.301
You've seen one before?

04:20.385 --> 04:21.678
Oh yeah.

04:21.761 --> 04:26.057
In '83, during my vacay at the Zurich
Institute for the Criminally Insane.

04:26.599 --> 04:27.767
Where I got my first lobotomy.

04:27.850 --> 04:31.271
But you know lobotomies.
They're like tattoos. Can't just get one.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.897
Tell me about the Hyde.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.359
Ah. Olga Malacova.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.362
Jeez. She had it all.

04:39.445 --> 04:43.408
Beauty, brains,
and a penchant for necrophilia.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.120
Olga was a concert pianist,

04:47.620 --> 04:51.124
until one night she transformed
in the middle of a Chopin sonata.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.668
Massacred a dozen audience members.

04:53.751 --> 04:55.378
And three music critics.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.423
What triggered her?
Or did she just change on her own?

04:59.007 --> 05:00.049
No idea.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.969
I only saw her
in group electroshock therapy.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.431
There's never been any mention
of Hydes in any outcast book.

05:06.514 --> 05:09.267
And Nevermore is reputed
for having the best collection.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.353
You try Nathaniel Faulkner's diary?

05:14.522 --> 05:15.523
Mmm!

05:16.774 --> 05:18.234
Before he founded Nevermore,

05:18.318 --> 05:22.280
Faulkner traveled the world,
cataloging every outcast community.

05:22.947 --> 05:24.324
How do you know this?

05:24.407 --> 05:28.036
You think your parents can't keep
their hands off each other now, oy vey.

05:28.953 --> 05:32.248
I showed up unannounced one night
in Gomez's dorm room.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.084
Let's just say
I wasn't interrupting a pillow fight.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.794
-Uncle Fester.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.255
-Yeah.
-The diary, where is it?

05:39.339 --> 05:41.215
Nightshades Library.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.677
Your dad parked me there and said
I should settle in for a long stretch.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.513
And that's when I found
this nifty little safe.

05:48.431 --> 05:53.561
I was hoping for a stash of cash or jewels
but instead I found a diary.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.732
We'll sneak into
the Nightshades Library tonight.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.150
In the meantime, lay low.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.407
If you are discovered,

06:06.908 --> 06:09.994
I will disown you and collect
the reward tied to your capture.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.455
I'd expect nothing less.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.838
-Leave the bees alone.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.891
<i>My novel started out</i>
<i>as a twisted fiction,</i>

06:32.600 --> 06:36.145
<i>but somehow reality has turned it</i>
<i>into my own personal looking glass.</i>

06:36.979 --> 06:40.191
<i>My visit to the Gates mansion</i>
<i>has left me with so many questions.</i>

06:41.275 --> 06:44.737
<i>If Laurel Gates died 20 years ago,</i>
<i>then who's sleeping in her bedroom?</i>

06:44.821 --> 06:46.531
<i>Why do they have photos of me?</i>

06:47.031 --> 06:49.158
<i>And what is their connection to this Hyde?</i>

06:50.201 --> 06:53.538
<i>Whoever it is, they're clearly willing</i>
<i>to kill for their secret.</i>

06:57.166 --> 07:00.461
<i>Goody predicted this quest for answers</i>
<i>would become a lonely pursuit.</i>

07:01.963 --> 07:04.340
<i>Of course, Goody's nowhere</i>
<i>to be found when I need her.</i>

07:06.384 --> 07:09.470
<i>The dead can be just as annoying</i>
<i>and unreliable as the living.</i>

07:12.306 --> 07:13.141
Hi.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.894
Sorry, I figured you were
still at Mayor Walker's wake.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.313
As soon as the dirt
hits the coffin, I'm out.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.901
I can't seem to find
my bottle of silver moon nail polish.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.195
-Do you mind if I look around?

07:27.280 --> 07:29.615
Yoko's hosting
a mani-pedi party for her crew.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.785
This is the third time
in 24 hours you've forgotten something.

07:33.786 --> 07:34.787
So,

07:35.913 --> 07:37.290
how is everything going?

07:37.373 --> 07:38.958
Solitude suits me.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.878
With no annoying distractions,
I'm almost finished with my novel.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.338
Was I an annoying distraction?

07:44.422 --> 07:47.258
-You definitely had some annoying habits.
-Such as?

07:47.341 --> 07:50.428
You giggle when you text,
which is a 24/7 addiction.

07:50.511 --> 07:54.182
At least it's not a migraine-inducing
typewriter hammering into my head.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.476
When not grinding your canines,
you growl in your sleep.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.769
As opposed to late night cello solos?

07:58.853 --> 08:01.772
You over-commit to activities,
then complain about them.

08:01.856 --> 08:04.275
I'd take that over your obsession
with all things creepy.

08:04.358 --> 08:07.236
You could gas an entire village
with the amount of perfume you spritz.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.071
That's just off the top of my head.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.326
Guess I'm lucky with the new bestie
that doesn't try to find ways

08:13.409 --> 08:16.954
to endanger literally everybody
she comes into contact with.

08:17.038 --> 08:21.334
In fact, Yoko and I are so in sync that
she's begging me to be her new roomie.

08:21.417 --> 08:22.418
Permanently.

08:24.045 --> 08:27.173
-Don't let me hold you back.
-Enjoy your solitude, Wednesday.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.550
It's not solitude if you're still here.

09:03.042 --> 09:03.960
Uncle Fester?

09:07.338 --> 09:08.756
Who's Uncle Fester?

09:10.049 --> 09:11.551
What are you doing here?

09:11.634 --> 09:14.387
Since I'm an actual Nightshade,
I don't have to explain myself.

09:14.470 --> 09:17.181
What's your excuse for creeping around
in the middle of the night?

09:17.682 --> 09:18.683
Research.

09:19.183 --> 09:20.184
On the monster?

09:21.519 --> 09:22.520
I'll save you some time.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.064
There's nothing in here
matching that thing.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.692
Isn't that convenient?

09:27.775 --> 09:29.277
You know what your problem is?

09:31.028 --> 09:33.155
I would love to hear
your piercing insight.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.411
You don't know who your real friends are.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.789
I've been on your side since day one.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.417
I literally saved your life.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.961
I believed your theories
when nobody else did.

09:47.044 --> 09:49.797
And what do I get in return?
Just nothing but suspicion and lies.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.341
Fine. You want honesty? Here it is.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.344
Every time the monster's attacked,
you've been right there.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.680
Starting with Rowan
at the Harvest Festival.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.395
Then on Outreach Day,

10:04.478 --> 10:07.315
you arrived just minutes
after the monster disappeared,

10:07.398 --> 10:08.941
yet you say you didn't see it.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.613
I didn't realize proximity was a crime.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.406
Then there's your drawing obsession.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.451
You have drawn the monster
dozens of times,

10:18.534 --> 10:20.786
yet you've never seen it. Or so you claim.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.290
You even drew where it lived.
Then when Eugene went to investigate,

10:25.625 --> 10:28.127
<i>you tried to kill him</i>
<i>so he wouldn't spill your secret.</i>

10:28.794 --> 10:30.546
You think I would hurt Eugene?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.715
Let's not forget
your oh-so-convenient appearance

10:32.798 --> 10:35.217
after Tyler had been attacked
at the Gates mansion.

10:38.095 --> 10:39.513
If I am the monster,

10:40.681 --> 10:42.183
then why haven't I killed you?

10:46.270 --> 10:49.732
Because for some reason I cannot fathom
or indulge, you seem to like me.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.361
What's to like?

11:06.749 --> 11:07.958
How long have you been lurking?

11:08.042 --> 11:11.587
Long enough to feel
the tension between you two.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.880
Yowza!

11:12.963 --> 11:15.800
Seriously, you could cut it
with an executioner's axe.

11:17.635 --> 11:21.889
I'd recognize the patter
of those fingertips anywhere.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.432
Hello, Thing.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.728
You can't still be mad
about the Kalamazoo job.

11:27.812 --> 11:28.854
It wasn't my fault.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.316
You said you could crack that safe
in 30 seconds.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.610
Five minutes later, we were still there.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.820
You're all thumbs.

11:35.903 --> 11:36.904
Enough.

11:41.742 --> 11:42.576
Let him go.

11:45.162 --> 11:46.539
Show me the diary.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.213
Here we are.

11:55.297 --> 11:57.800
Iggy was Faulkner's right hand.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.594
Trained a generation of Nightshades.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.680
And behind Iggy Itt…

12:07.017 --> 12:10.020
Do I have time for a snooze,
or can you crack this quickly?

12:30.499 --> 12:33.794
This is turning into
a replay of Kalamazoo.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.152
These are some sweet digs.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.238
How'd you swing your own single?

13:01.322 --> 13:04.116
My former roommate
couldn't handle my toxic personality.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.201
Mmm.

13:07.787 --> 13:08.746
Here it is.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.083
Faulkner describes Hydes
as artists by nature,

13:13.167 --> 13:15.085
but equally vindictive in temperament.

13:15.586 --> 13:19.215
Born of mutation, the Hyde lays dormant
until unleashed by a traumatic event

13:19.298 --> 13:22.009
or unlocked through
chemical inducement or hypnosis.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.596
This causes the Hyde to develop
an immediate bond with its liberator,

13:25.679 --> 13:27.681
who the creature now sees as its master.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.268
It becomes the willing instrument
of whatever nefarious agenda

13:31.352 --> 13:32.853
this new master might propose.

13:33.813 --> 13:37.233
Anyone willing
to unlock a Hyde is a next-level sicko.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.237
That means I'm not looking
for one killer but two.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.031
The monster and its master.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.374
I didn't mean to startle you.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.128
I was just working on my novel.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.843
Enid has requested to room with Yoko
for the rest of the school year.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.345
She did?

14:06.428 --> 14:07.847
When there's a falling out,

14:07.930 --> 14:10.808
I like to get both girls' perspectives
on what happened.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.019
You two seemed as thick as thieves.

14:14.103 --> 14:17.648
Ultimately, thieves turn on each other.
I've seen it with my own eyes.

14:18.232 --> 14:21.902
Deflect all you want, but you and I
both know that you care about Enid.

14:22.820 --> 14:26.240
And you have to admit she managed
to bring out a spark of warmth in you.

14:26.907 --> 14:29.076
Oh, don't worry. Just a tiny spark.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.412
Barely perceptible to the average eye,

14:31.495 --> 14:33.205
but… I noticed.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.792
Part of the dorm experience is

14:36.876 --> 14:40.129
making friends with people
that you wouldn't normally connect with.

14:40.629 --> 14:44.341
And those friendships
often turn into lifelong bonds.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.759
I would rather buy a rope.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.263
Is it really so difficult for you
to admit that you made a friend,

14:49.346 --> 14:51.932
and now that she's gone
you might actually miss her?

14:54.018 --> 14:55.144
I'll survive alone.

14:55.686 --> 14:56.604
I always have.

14:58.772 --> 15:02.276
Well, if that's your decision,
I'll submit the forms to Principal Weems.

15:15.205 --> 15:16.123
Uncle Fester?

15:31.013 --> 15:32.014
Uncle Fester?

15:35.100 --> 15:38.228
Hey! Being a solo lobo has its perks.

15:38.312 --> 15:41.398
You get to live by your own rules,
do whatever you want.

15:41.482 --> 15:44.026
Just look at me.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.992
Hi. Um, I need to talk to you.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.411
No, like… like, right now.

15:55.579 --> 15:56.997
Yeah, I know where that is.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.626
Okay, I can meet you there
in, like, 20 minutes.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.294
Okay. Bye.

16:02.378 --> 16:03.504
Who're you talking to?

16:04.713 --> 16:07.675
-It's none of your goddamn business.
-I know what you are, Xavier.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.760
Can you stay the hell away from me?

16:21.063 --> 16:22.606
Did you place the tracker?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.944
Don't worry.
Uncle Fester's got you covered.

16:29.613 --> 16:32.366
Okay. Let's hit the road.

16:36.578 --> 16:37.579
What?

16:37.663 --> 16:39.665
I picked it up on my way out of town.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.918
You know me. I like to travel incognito.

16:51.844 --> 16:52.886
Come on, let's roll!

17:28.130 --> 17:30.007
Hey! What's so urgent?

17:30.507 --> 17:31.717
What happened?

17:33.260 --> 17:34.845
I had a dream where you died.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.472
Get in the car.

17:49.735 --> 17:53.155
Principal Weems, it is imperative
I speak with you about Dr. Kinbott.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.699
Wednesday. We were just talking about you.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.284
Speak of the devil.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.245
And she shall appear.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.206
Dr. Kinbott was just
discussing your assessment.

18:02.289 --> 18:05.375
I need to sign off on it
before she hands it in to the court.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.420
Well, what's the verdict, Doctor?
Am I cured?

18:09.671 --> 18:13.175
I'm glad you find it amusing.
The judge assigned to your case won't.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.177
I've explained to Dr. Kinbott

18:15.260 --> 18:18.180
that you've recently been taking
small but meaningful steps

18:18.263 --> 18:20.641
towards embracing
your new Nevermore family.

18:21.850 --> 18:22.684
Yes.

18:23.727 --> 18:26.146
I think I've actually reached
the half-hug stage.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.066
I've been reading about hypnotherapy.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.860
It might be a good technique
to unlock my inner Wednesday.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.403
Are you a devotee?

18:34.363 --> 18:35.823
Yes, very much so.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.576
I applaud your new willingness
to delve deep into yourself.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.120
I'm seeing you on Monday.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.287
We can start then.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.874
What did you so urgently
need to discuss, Wednesday?

18:47.876 --> 18:48.710
It can wait.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.796
Now if you'll excuse me,

18:51.380 --> 18:53.215
I have some homework to finish.

19:02.766 --> 19:04.726
Kinbott has to be Xavier's master.

19:04.810 --> 19:05.644
Hmm.

19:05.727 --> 19:08.063
The Hyde lays dormant
until unleashed by a traumatic event

19:08.147 --> 19:10.774
or unlocked through
chemical inducement or hypnosis.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.276
Mmm!

19:15.988 --> 19:17.156
Are you listening?

19:18.073 --> 19:21.201
She must've figured out he's a Hyde
and used hypnotherapy to unlock him.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.328
That would explain their secret sessions.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.707
I think the kid behind the counter
has clocked me.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.127
Yeah. He's walking over.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.212
I'm gonna put him
in a Romanian sleeper hold.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.338
-Cover me.
-Relax.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.882
He's not interested in you.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.719
Uh, made you a quad. On the house.

19:39.219 --> 19:42.097
Hey, thanks kid.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.057
Need a refill on this puppy too.

19:45.475 --> 19:46.643
-Uh--
-Tyler.

19:46.727 --> 19:47.936
This is my Uncle Fester.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.189
Oh. Uh…

19:50.272 --> 19:51.815
-Hi, it's nice to--

19:59.489 --> 20:00.324
Is that…?

20:04.328 --> 20:05.329
It's called a Hyde.

20:08.123 --> 20:10.417
Whoa, that's it. From that night.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.380
Your father gave you
explicit instructions not to be near me.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.467
Yeah, my dad's not here,
and I'm on a break.

20:20.093 --> 20:23.472
Well, apparently a Hyde needs to be
unlocked by someone. Its master.

20:23.555 --> 20:24.765
Holy shit.

20:26.642 --> 20:27.476
Tyler.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.020
What'd I say?

20:32.147 --> 20:33.148
Uh…

20:35.817 --> 20:38.028
For the record,
Wednesday was trying to keep her distance.

20:38.111 --> 20:40.072
I was the one that sat down with her.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.034
All right.

20:44.826 --> 20:46.161
Putting these up around town.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.164
It's a bank robbery suspect,
and he's a real creep.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.124
-You haven't seen him, have you?
-No.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.877
Yeah, he'd be pretty hard to miss.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.463
I'll pin it on the bulletin board.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.388
Ah, why waste my breath?

21:08.809 --> 21:10.936
Thank you. But you didn't have to do that.

21:11.019 --> 21:14.398
Yeah, your family's very… colorful.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.025
Ironic considering Fester's
the black sheep.

21:17.609 --> 21:18.735
He's harmless.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.822
So, about rescheduling our date…

21:24.074 --> 21:25.617
Between the monster and my uncle--

21:25.701 --> 21:26.535
Hey, no excuses.

21:26.618 --> 21:29.079
Figure after what happened
last time, you owe me.

21:30.872 --> 21:33.208
I can't sneak off of campus.
All eyes are on me.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.377
You won't have to.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.045
I'll come to you.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.964
9:00 p.m., Crackstone's Crypt.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.366
I don't miss her.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.578
Friends are a liability
and can be exploited.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.204
That makes them weaknesses.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.623
Your job is to guard
that diary while I'm gone.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.168
I'll be back as soon as I can.

22:18.378 --> 22:19.338
It's not a date.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.467
It's a quid pro quo
for almost getting him disemboweled.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.218
Watch that diary!

22:34.144 --> 22:37.272
Last time somebody threw a surprise
for me here, it did not go as planned.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.984
I guarantee this one
won't make you pass out cold.

22:41.943 --> 22:44.071
But you do have to close your eyes.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.073
Are you serious?

22:46.740 --> 22:47.657
Unfortunately.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.996
I'm only doing this because I owe you.

22:53.497 --> 22:55.040
Okay. Watch your step.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.251
Wait here. Close your eyes.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.255
Okay.

23:05.675 --> 23:07.469
Easy. Right here.

23:08.512 --> 23:09.638
One second.

23:15.936 --> 23:18.188
Okay, you can open your eyes now.

23:38.125 --> 23:41.920
What? No one's ever taken you
on a picnic inside a crypt before?

23:51.138 --> 23:53.140
How do you feel about scary movies?

23:57.018 --> 23:58.687
Prepare to be horrified.

24:28.925 --> 24:31.303
That is definitely our suspect's bike.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.138
Looks as weird as he does.

24:34.514 --> 24:38.226
All right, he couldn't have got too far
on foot. So, you guys spread out.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.562
I'm going to check down by the lake.

24:48.236 --> 24:49.738
That was torture.

24:51.031 --> 24:51.865
Thank you.

24:55.785 --> 24:59.080
Okay, don't hate me.
I'm just gonna come out and say it.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.793
I want us to be more than friends.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.297
You'll snap out of it.

25:07.964 --> 25:08.882
Don't do that.

25:08.965 --> 25:10.383
Discount my feelings.

25:11.176 --> 25:14.221
I'm not friend material,
let alone more-than-friend material.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.682
I will ignore you, stomp on your heart,

25:17.766 --> 25:19.935
and always put my needs
and interests first.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.481
Yeah, you can keep trying to push me away.

25:24.564 --> 25:25.774
It's not going to work.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.234
I almost killed you.

25:27.317 --> 25:28.360
I survived.

25:28.443 --> 25:30.487
-Beginner's luck.
-I'm tougher than you think.

25:36.409 --> 25:37.953
You're making a mistake.

25:39.287 --> 25:40.121
Probably.

25:41.623 --> 25:42.457
Definitely.

25:52.217 --> 25:53.301
What the hell?

25:53.885 --> 25:55.011
Tyler.

25:55.095 --> 25:57.305
Dad? What are you doing here?

25:58.974 --> 26:01.184
The school groundskeeper
found a motorbike by the lake.

26:01.268 --> 26:04.062
It matches the description
of the one the bank robber stole.

26:04.145 --> 26:07.524
There's a canoe missing.
Figured he might be on Raven Island.

26:08.942 --> 26:12.654
I'm not going to ask what this is,
but I never saw the two of you here.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.239
You got it?

26:15.407 --> 26:17.450
Unbelievable. Come on.

26:29.754 --> 26:30.755
The diary…

26:34.009 --> 26:34.843
Thing?

26:44.769 --> 26:45.687
Thing…

26:57.991 --> 26:59.826
Fester? Fester, help!

26:59.909 --> 27:01.745
Help! Help! Thing's not moving.

27:01.828 --> 27:04.122
-He was stabbed!
-Get him on the table!

27:24.643 --> 27:25.602
Oh, come on, Thing.

27:48.291 --> 27:49.834
He's gone, Wednesday.

27:50.585 --> 27:51.920
No, he's not. Thing.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.172
If you can hear me…

27:56.341 --> 27:58.593
if you die, I will kill you.

28:00.428 --> 28:01.554
Go again.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.515
Now! Again, please!

28:27.872 --> 28:30.792
For a minute, we thought
you'd picked your last lock, buddy.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.421
Who did this to you?

28:37.549 --> 28:39.926
Knife from behind the back. Cowards.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.346
I promise that whoever did this to you
will suffer.

28:43.847 --> 28:45.140
And it will be slow,

28:45.974 --> 28:46.850
long,

28:47.892 --> 28:49.769
and excruciatingly painful.

29:06.244 --> 29:07.746
I'll stitch him back up.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.166
They found your motorbike, so…

29:12.459 --> 29:14.085
the sheriff won't be far. You need to go.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.297
Maybe next time
steal something a little less conspicuous.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.340
Where's the fun in that?

29:21.551 --> 29:24.220
All right. I'll lay low here tonight,

29:24.304 --> 29:27.682
keep an eye on the patient,
and I'll skedaddle in the morning.

29:30.018 --> 29:33.062
I guess I'll see you at your arraignment
or the next family reunion.

29:33.646 --> 29:35.482
You'll always be my favorite, Wednesday.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.193
Be sure to tell Pugsley that.

29:39.068 --> 29:40.403
It'll give him a complex.

29:47.452 --> 29:50.288
I'm guessing it's not
some kind of random prank.

29:50.371 --> 29:53.958
Whoever ransacked my room
also stole Nathaniel Faulkner's diary.

29:54.042 --> 29:57.170
That's supposed to be safely locked
in the Nightshades Library.

29:57.253 --> 29:58.797
So you do know about that diary,

29:58.880 --> 30:01.966
which means you also know
the monster we're after is called a Hyde.

30:06.471 --> 30:09.307
Thank you, Ms. Thornhill.
I'll take it from here.

30:09.891 --> 30:13.228
Of course. If you need anything,
I'll be right down the hall.

30:33.164 --> 30:36.042
Faulkner spent years studying Hydes.

30:37.710 --> 30:40.296
He wanted to determine
if they were just mindless killers

30:40.380 --> 30:42.465
or conscious of their actions.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.175
What was his conclusion?

30:44.926 --> 30:47.637
He was killed by a Hyde
before he could reach one.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.265
Others tried to carry on his research,

30:50.348 --> 30:53.059
but the Hydes were
too unpredictable and violent.

30:54.185 --> 30:57.146
They were officially banned
from Nevermore 30 years ago.

30:59.566 --> 31:02.235
All of this time,
you've known the monster was a Hyde.

31:03.403 --> 31:04.737
Why didn't you tell the sheriff?

31:05.822 --> 31:07.949
Because then Nevermore is done.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.450
Over. Shut for good.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.703
And that's not happening on my watch.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.414
But I'm not the only one withholding.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.250
If you suspect someone,
you need to tell me.

31:17.333 --> 31:18.209
Why?

31:19.335 --> 31:21.796
All you've ever done
is gaslight and obstruct me.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.466
You don't care how many people die,
as long as your reputation is safe.

31:27.802 --> 31:33.850
I am protecting our Nevermore family,
which also includes you, Ms. Addams.

31:53.119 --> 31:54.078
Come with me.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.873
I have information
about Mayor Walker's murder.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.760
Printed these off my dad's computer.

32:08.843 --> 32:11.137
Seems he was trying to track down someone.

32:11.220 --> 32:14.432
Laurel Gates? Looks like
he started right after Outreach Day.

32:14.515 --> 32:16.017
Must have recognized her there.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.686
According to British police,
Laurel was presumed drowned,

32:18.770 --> 32:20.355
but no body was ever recovered.

32:21.564 --> 32:24.943
The Gates mansion was purchased
a year ago by a 90-year-old candy heiress.

32:25.026 --> 32:28.738
She then mysteriously died and gave
all of her belongings to her caregiver,

32:29.405 --> 32:30.740
Teresa L. Glau.

32:32.992 --> 32:34.369
It's an anagram for Laurel Gates.

32:35.453 --> 32:37.330
Laurel secretly buys her old house

32:37.413 --> 32:39.791
and then comes back
to Jericho as someone else.

32:40.583 --> 32:41.417
Why?

32:43.670 --> 32:47.131
Revenge on all the people she blames
for her family's misfortunes. Your father.

32:48.091 --> 32:48.925
The coroner.

32:49.008 --> 32:50.093
My parents.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.053
Most of all, Nevermore.

32:52.845 --> 32:54.555
How does the monster fit into all of this?

32:55.139 --> 32:57.850
The monster is a Hyde.
It's doing Laurel's bidding.

32:57.934 --> 32:58.935
She controls it.

32:59.686 --> 33:02.438
You know who Laurel is, don't you?

33:07.860 --> 33:10.655
Wednesday, we don't have
an appointment scheduled today.

33:11.364 --> 33:12.824
I wanted to return something.

33:12.907 --> 33:13.908
Uh…

33:15.243 --> 33:17.328
I found it in your old childhood room.

33:23.960 --> 33:27.964
I know you're Laurel Gates, and you've
come back to Jericho to seek your revenge.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.926
And so did Mayor Walker,
which is why you had to kill him.

33:32.427 --> 33:34.887
Who better to slide in and out
of the hospital undetected

33:34.971 --> 33:37.432
than a psychiatrist under the guise
of visiting another patient?

33:39.767 --> 33:42.562
You're not actually accusing me
of murdering the mayor?

33:42.645 --> 33:45.356
The roses you left
in Eugene's room were your mistake.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.484
They're the same variety
I found near your childhood bed.

33:48.568 --> 33:51.029
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

33:51.112 --> 33:54.198
There's only one reason an overqualified
psychiatrist like yourself

33:54.282 --> 33:57.326
would settle in the inconsequential
backwater that is Jericho.

33:57.410 --> 34:00.538
It allowed you to crawl through
the troubled, young minds of outcasts

34:00.621 --> 34:03.916
until you found one that you can
manipulate to exact your revenge.

34:06.294 --> 34:07.295
You know what?

34:07.378 --> 34:10.339
I don't have time
to deal with your delusional fantasies.

34:10.423 --> 34:11.799
I have a patient emergency.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.593
Who? Xavier?

34:14.177 --> 34:16.929
I know all about the secret sessions
you've been holding in your car.

34:17.472 --> 34:20.516
I also found the cave where you've been
holding sessions to unlock his Hyde.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.853
You are so out of line.

34:23.936 --> 34:26.355
Do you know
how violently unpredictable a Hyde can be?

34:26.439 --> 34:29.275
It was your plan to have Xavier committed
before he could turn on you too.

34:29.358 --> 34:32.153
Wednesday, you need help.

34:32.236 --> 34:33.863
More help than I can give you.

34:33.946 --> 34:35.323
Who you calling? Xavier?

34:36.115 --> 34:37.325
Judge Reynolds.

34:37.408 --> 34:41.037
I'm going to recommend you stay
in a juvenile psychiatric facility.

34:41.120 --> 34:44.540
Oh, please. You and I both know
I'd be running that place in a week.

34:48.336 --> 34:49.462
Time's up, Laurel.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.476
Principal Weems, it's Valerie Kinbott.

35:03.559 --> 35:05.561
Wednesday Addams
just barged into my office.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.356
I wasn't aware
that Wednesday had a session today.

35:08.439 --> 35:11.400
She didn't, and her behavior
was completely irrational.

35:12.985 --> 35:15.113
-<i>Dr. Kinbott?</i>

35:19.575 --> 35:20.618
<i>Dr. Kinbott?</i>

35:55.361 --> 35:56.237
She's gone.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.364
Dr. Kinbott's dead.

36:01.325 --> 36:02.535
This ends now.

36:23.723 --> 36:26.100
You know what?
You need to stay out of my space.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.977
You need to take your own advice.

36:30.229 --> 36:31.480
You left that in my room.

36:32.315 --> 36:33.900
Actually, you left it in Thing.

36:34.984 --> 36:36.986
How long have you been seeing Kinbott?

36:37.486 --> 36:38.321
Have you…?

36:40.948 --> 36:44.911
What am I saying? Of course you have.
You've been spying on me, right?

36:49.207 --> 36:52.084
'Cause I'm the villain in your fantasy.

36:54.170 --> 36:59.217
My father thinks that my mental health
is a PR problem that he needs to manage.

37:00.968 --> 37:03.679
He wanted to keep
his troubled son out of the tabloids.

37:06.098 --> 37:07.225
I wasn't in your room.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.686
Believe me or don't believe me,

37:10.770 --> 37:11.979
I don't care.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.031
Your painting's been improving.

37:22.531 --> 37:24.116
I enjoy this one in particular.

37:28.537 --> 37:30.206
Feels like you really lived it.

37:32.708 --> 37:35.211
-What do you want?
-I'm asking the questions.

37:40.549 --> 37:42.969
What is Rowan's inhaler
doing in your shed?

37:47.265 --> 37:48.599
Or Eugene's glasses?

37:50.226 --> 37:51.435
Whoa, whoa.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.896
Or these stalker images you took of me?

37:53.980 --> 37:56.232
-No. I--
-Don't forget your latest addition.

37:59.402 --> 38:00.778
Kinbott's necklace.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.239
-Somebody planted that stuff!
-Freeze!

38:03.823 --> 38:06.367
Drop the knife. Down on your knees.

38:07.618 --> 38:08.452
Cuff him.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.454
-You have the right to remain silent.
-What?

38:10.538 --> 38:13.040
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in court.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.875
You have the right to an attorney.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.461
If you cannot afford an attorney
one will be appointed.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.088
Appreciate the help, Addams.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.716
You! You framed me!

38:22.508 --> 38:23.676
I'm being set up.

38:24.593 --> 38:25.720
I shoulda let Rowan kill you.

38:42.528 --> 38:43.404
Hey.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.157
You're back.

38:46.907 --> 38:49.327
I'm gone for a few days,
the place gets trashed,

38:49.410 --> 38:50.661
and Thing almost dies.

38:51.495 --> 38:53.456
Someone's gotta look out for you two.

38:53.539 --> 38:54.957
What happened to rooming with Yoko?

38:55.541 --> 38:59.295
Yoko's great. I just decided
I needed a few more boundaries.

39:00.588 --> 39:01.881
Skip the tape.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.759
Don't tell me Wednesday Addams
is mellowing out.

39:04.842 --> 39:05.718
Never.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.347
More like evolving.

39:09.930 --> 39:12.266
Well, one inch of duct tape at a time.

39:13.809 --> 39:15.144
Why the sudden change of heart?

39:16.270 --> 39:17.271
Because we work.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.982
We shouldn't, but we do.

39:20.066 --> 39:22.443
It's like some sort of weird,
friendship anomaly.

39:22.526 --> 39:24.820
Everything you said about me is true.

39:25.946 --> 39:27.656
But I don't apologize for it.

39:28.324 --> 39:29.283
Not anymore.

39:31.118 --> 39:32.203
It's just who I am.

39:37.750 --> 39:38.751
Thing said he missed you.

39:40.836 --> 39:42.129
I missed him too.

39:45.841 --> 39:47.468
I'm sorry about Xavier.

39:48.135 --> 39:50.805
I'm not. He's a liar and a killer.

39:51.514 --> 39:55.559
Besides… there's nothing quite like
the feeling of being proven right.

39:56.143 --> 39:58.187
Except maybe someone to share it with.

39:59.188 --> 40:01.440
Thing may have blabbed
about your date with Tyler.

40:01.524 --> 40:02.691
So how'd it go?

40:03.484 --> 40:04.860
It was interrupted.

40:08.072 --> 40:11.283
Well, I heard
Tyler's working the late shift…

40:21.419 --> 40:22.503
We're closed.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.005
Then you should lock your doors.

40:27.133 --> 40:29.260
There's some real sick people out there.

40:32.388 --> 40:35.433
Yeah, my dad told me
what happened with Xavier.

40:37.643 --> 40:39.019
Pretty nuts.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.063
That guy always seemed so normal.

40:42.189 --> 40:44.400
You know, for an outcast.

40:45.192 --> 40:46.193
Well, you know,

40:47.736 --> 40:49.780
it has made me re-evaluate things.

40:52.658 --> 40:53.534
Like what?

40:55.494 --> 40:56.745
Like who I can trust.

41:00.207 --> 41:02.668
That mean you're ready
to be more than friends?

41:43.959 --> 41:46.045
-Whoa, hey!

42:02.978 --> 42:03.854
You okay?

42:05.105 --> 42:05.981
I need to go.

42:07.274 --> 42:08.108
What?

42:09.652 --> 42:10.819
Wh… What's wrong?

42:12.154 --> 42:13.072
Wednesday!

42:18.786 --> 42:20.412
<i>Of course the first boy I kiss</i>

42:20.496 --> 42:23.499
<i>would turn out to be a psychotic,</i>
<i>serial-killing monster.</i>

42:25.084 --> 42:26.418
<i>I guess I have a type.</i>
