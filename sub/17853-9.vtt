WEBVTT

00:02.420 --> 00:03.819
I think we explored 10-X.

00:03.921 --> 00:05.821
- No. No. Nope.
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:05.923 --> 00:07.723
Why do you guys keep
handing on to this?

00:07.825 --> 00:08.825
Because I believe.

00:08.893 --> 00:09.903
Let's put this machine in there.

00:09.927 --> 00:11.627
Yeah. Let's get in hole.

00:11.729 --> 00:14.029
I still am puzzled by
what's in the bottom of 10-X.

00:14.131 --> 00:15.831
I still see the square target.

00:15.933 --> 00:18.067
I think it's still in
the same position.

00:18.169 --> 00:19.568
John Chatterton is back.

00:19.670 --> 00:22.304
Hopefully, he can put his eyes
on the target.

00:24.175 --> 00:25.775
He's got something on
the metal detector.

00:30.648 --> 00:34.717
<i>There is an island in
the North Atlantic where people</i>

00:34.819 --> 00:37.386
have been looking for
an incredible treasure

00:37.488 --> 00:40.422
<i>for more than 200 years.</i>

00:40.524 --> 00:44.026
<i>So far, they have found bits
of gold chain,</i>

00:44.128 --> 00:48.330
<i>a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it,</i>

00:48.432 --> 00:51.767
<i>even a 17th century Spanish
coin.</i>

00:51.869 --> 00:57.106
<i>To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.</i>

00:57.208 --> 00:59.441
<i>And, according to legend,</i>

00:59.543 --> 01:02.611
<i>one more will have to die,</i>

01:02.713 --> 01:05.214
<i>before the treasure
can be found.</i>

01:17.228 --> 01:20.629
<i>For brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina,</i>

01:20.731 --> 01:24.266
<i>this summer has proven to be
one of the most productive</i>

01:24.368 --> 01:28.704
<i>in the 221 year search
for treasure on Oak Island.</i>

01:34.478 --> 01:36.578
<i>In addition to already
uncovering</i>

01:36.680 --> 01:38.647
<i>a number of important clues...</i>

01:38.749 --> 01:40.149
That's the hatch!

01:40.251 --> 01:42.484
It's a large board.

01:42.586 --> 01:43.886
<i>They have made significant</i>

01:43.988 --> 01:45.487
<i>finds in the swamp...</i>

01:45.589 --> 01:48.457
It may be a ship's plank.

01:48.559 --> 01:51.260
<i>And on property once owned</i>

01:51.362 --> 01:54.296
<i>by former American slave,
Samuel Ball.</i>

01:54.398 --> 01:55.931
I think this is an encampment.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.833
This is quite a haul. Wow, Gary.

01:57.935 --> 02:00.636
1700s. That changes a lot.

02:00.738 --> 02:04.406
<i>But what is perhaps
their most challenging,</i>

02:04.508 --> 02:08.544
<i>and potentially rewarding
discovery lies ahead:</i>

02:08.645 --> 02:13.182
<i>The exploration of borehole
C-1 by world-renown diver,</i>

02:13.284 --> 02:14.683
<i>John Chatterton.</i>

02:14.785 --> 02:18.320
We entered a swimmable
cavity that may extend

02:18.422 --> 02:19.822
into the original money pit.

02:19.924 --> 02:22.157
Your question is,
"Are we interested?"

02:22.259 --> 02:23.926
That is our question.

02:24.028 --> 02:26.428
We prefer you didn't have
that great success without us.

02:28.599 --> 02:31.099
<i>It was at C-1 where, last year,</i>

02:31.202 --> 02:35.204
<i>Rick Lagina and Oak Island
historian, Charles Barkhouse,</i>

02:35.306 --> 02:38.674
<i>drilled a six-inch wide
exploratory borehole</i>

02:38.776 --> 02:41.677
<i>in an effort to
pinpoint the exact location</i>

02:41.779 --> 02:44.346
<i>of the original Money Pit.</i>

02:44.448 --> 02:48.417
<i>In addition to discovering what
appeared to be a 21 foot tall</i>

02:48.519 --> 02:52.955
<i>void some 171 feet deep below
the surface of the island...</i>

02:56.293 --> 02:57.726
Here we go.

02:57.828 --> 02:59.561
<i>They also came upon what
appeared to be</i>

02:59.663 --> 03:04.466
<i>a shiny metallic object,
possibly man-made.</i>

03:04.568 --> 03:06.902
- What's that?
- Shiny. Like metal.

03:07.004 --> 03:08.570
Yeah, it looks metallic.

03:08.672 --> 03:10.205
Look how yellow that is.

03:10.307 --> 03:12.407
It's your gold color, David.

03:17.348 --> 03:19.014
All right. Here we are.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.850
<i>But today, while Rick,
Marty, and the team</i>

03:21.952 --> 03:24.253
<i>await John Chatterton's arrival,</i>

03:24.355 --> 03:26.521
<i>they have arranged to meet
once again</i>

03:26.624 --> 03:29.491
<i>with underwater imaging expert,
Brian Abbott.</i>

03:29.593 --> 03:30.993
- Brian!
- Good morning.

03:31.095 --> 03:33.428
- How we doing?
- Good. Good to see you again.

03:33.530 --> 03:35.497
Yeah, same here.

03:35.599 --> 03:37.833
<i>He has been invited
back to the island</i>

03:37.935 --> 03:40.836
<i>to collect additional
sonar scanning data</i>

03:40.938 --> 03:43.438
<i>at the bottom of borehole 10-X.</i>

03:43.540 --> 03:45.674
Baby! Let's get some data today.

03:45.776 --> 03:46.975
Here we go.

03:48.545 --> 03:50.545
<i>One year ago, after conducting</i>

03:50.648 --> 03:53.448
<i>a previous sonar scan of 10-X,</i>

03:53.550 --> 03:56.184
<i>Brian Abbott made
a stunning report.</i>

03:56.287 --> 03:58.053
There's a structure down there.

03:58.155 --> 04:01.623
It's roughly two and a half feet
by two feet.

04:01.725 --> 04:05.360
What we think this box could
be is a possible chest.

04:07.197 --> 04:09.798
Wait. Wait. Percent confidence,

04:09.900 --> 04:12.968
that that is a man-made chest?

04:13.070 --> 04:14.269
90%.

04:16.740 --> 04:18.440
<i>But when John Chatterton</i>

04:18.541 --> 04:21.310
<i>made his daring inspection of
10-X last summer...</i>

04:25.316 --> 04:28.784
<i>he contradicted
Brian Abbott's findings.</i>

04:28.886 --> 04:33.322
Right about here,
I had a rock that I would

04:33.424 --> 04:38.393
estimate was ten inches
to twelve inches.

04:38.495 --> 04:39.761
It was very angular,

04:39.863 --> 04:42.664
had at least one 90 degree
angle on it.

04:42.766 --> 04:44.266
I picked it up. I moved it.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.301
It was, it was heavy.

04:46.403 --> 04:51.340
To me, that was what gave you
the sonar's signal of the box.

04:57.081 --> 04:59.514
We know that John Chatterton
went down in that chamber.

04:59.616 --> 05:01.950
- Yes.
- But the key thing,

05:02.052 --> 05:05.020
he found a square stone right
where you saw what...

05:05.122 --> 05:06.482
- Yep.
- Could have been a chest.

05:06.557 --> 05:08.101
It fits perfectly with
the sonar, right?

05:08.125 --> 05:10.625
- Correct.
- So, if you rerun the sonar,

05:10.728 --> 05:13.295
and you still see the chest
in the same position,

05:13.397 --> 05:15.330
then John Chatterton never
saw it.

05:15.432 --> 05:16.676
- All right.
- If in fact you see

05:16.700 --> 05:18.667
the chest, and it is moved,

05:18.769 --> 05:21.303
to me that means he did
search the chamber.

05:21.405 --> 05:22.637
He did find the objects.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.439
He did eliminate them
as man-made.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.274
So, this is, this is
huge data right here.

05:26.377 --> 05:28.877
For Marty, not so much for me.

05:28.979 --> 05:33.215
In my mind, my brother has
to come my way a little bit.

05:33.317 --> 05:35.183
<i>Really, it's my brother's
agenda.</i>

05:35.285 --> 05:38.887
<i>He's of the belief that the
sonar can prove that the box</i>

05:38.989 --> 05:41.056
is really a rock.

05:41.158 --> 05:45.193
I have some...
several differences of opinion.

05:45.295 --> 05:47.662
Anyway, let's put
this machine in there.

05:47.765 --> 05:49.498
Yeah, let's get it in hole.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.701
<i>In order to insure that the data</i>

05:52.803 --> 05:56.505
<i>he collects remains consistent
with his previous efforts,</i>

05:56.607 --> 05:59.908
<i>Brian will be working
with the same MS 1000</i>

06:00.010 --> 06:03.078
<i>scanning sonar device he used
last year.</i>

06:03.180 --> 06:05.580
- Going down.
- Okay.

06:05.682 --> 06:09.184
<i>By sending out sonic
pulses that record</i>

06:09.286 --> 06:11.053
<i>the distances between the device</i>

06:11.155 --> 06:13.522
<i>and any objects around it,</i>

06:13.624 --> 06:16.091
<i>Brian will once again be able
to create</i>

06:16.193 --> 06:19.895
<i>a three dimensional picture
of the underground cavern.</i>

06:22.533 --> 06:24.733
Okay, let's hold it there
for a few minutes.

06:24.835 --> 06:26.902
- You got it.
- Okay.

06:27.004 --> 06:30.172
<i>For Rick Lagina
and the Blankenships,</i>

06:30.274 --> 06:34.676
<i>the data being collected from
10-X is critically important.</i>

06:34.778 --> 06:38.046
<i>If the object that Brian Abbott
and Dan Blankenship</i>

06:38.148 --> 06:41.349
<i>first identified
as a possible treasure chest,</i>

06:41.452 --> 06:44.553
<i>turns out to be the same
square-shaped rock</i>

06:44.655 --> 06:47.722
<i>that John Chatterton located,
and then moved,</i>

06:47.825 --> 06:49.691
<i>during his dive last year,</i>

06:49.793 --> 06:53.695
<i>then any further exploration
of 10-X would be unlikely.</i>

06:53.797 --> 06:55.517
We'll go ahead and lower
it a few more feet.

06:55.566 --> 06:58.100
<i>But if the sonar
records evidence of both</i>

06:58.202 --> 07:01.470
<i>the rock and what appeared
to be a chest,</i>

07:01.572 --> 07:04.706
<i>then the Laginas and
their partners may be closer</i>

07:04.808 --> 07:08.543
<i>to solving the Oak Island
mystery than they imagined.</i>

07:08.645 --> 07:10.378
So, Brian what are you seeing?

07:10.481 --> 07:12.147
I'm seeing a lot of the same
structure

07:12.249 --> 07:14.616
of the cavern down there
that I've seen before.

07:14.718 --> 07:16.985
- I like the word same.
- Yeah. Me too.

07:18.889 --> 07:21.590
I still see the square target
in this area.

07:21.692 --> 07:23.425
I think it's still in
the same position.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.627
Really?

07:25.729 --> 07:27.329
<i>At this point, Brian has</i>

07:27.431 --> 07:30.132
<i>sufficient data
to compare the subterranean</i>

07:30.234 --> 07:33.568
<i>cavity's current condition,
and last year's,</i>

07:33.670 --> 07:37.005
and then a definitive,
declarative statement

07:37.107 --> 07:39.341
can be made, either yay or nay.

07:39.443 --> 07:41.176
Thumbs up, thumbs down.

07:41.278 --> 07:44.012
How much of a definite statement

07:44.114 --> 07:46.014
can you make in terms of
comparison?

07:46.116 --> 07:49.284
Comparing it old to new data,
I can overlap them,

07:49.386 --> 07:51.486
do measurement tools,
all that type of stuff

07:51.588 --> 07:54.756
to see things have moved
or have not moved down there.

07:54.858 --> 07:57.159
I think I can be fairly
accurate with that.

07:57.261 --> 07:59.995
All right, let's get packed up
and let's-let's get

08:00.097 --> 08:01.774
you to where you can get us
what, you know,

08:01.798 --> 08:03.478
- the answers we need.
- Okay. Sounds good.

08:06.904 --> 08:09.371
<i>As the shadows of
another evening begin</i>

08:09.473 --> 08:11.139
<i>to cover Oak Island...</i>

08:11.241 --> 08:13.508
Okay, Brian, this is
what we've been waiting for.

08:13.610 --> 08:15.710
<i>Rick, Marty and their partners</i>

08:15.812 --> 08:17.846
<i>gather inside the War Room.</i>

08:17.948 --> 08:19.848
So what I've got is some
screen shots

08:19.950 --> 08:22.517
of kind of before
John Chatterton went

08:22.619 --> 08:24.653
into that cavern
to identify things.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.855
I got a shot of after
what we did today

08:26.957 --> 08:30.025
to show possibly some
differences, and so forth,

08:30.127 --> 08:32.071
- that have taken place so.
- Perfect. Can't wait.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.962
Let me pull this up.

08:34.063 --> 08:36.798
Okay, this is from a year
and a half ago.

08:36.900 --> 08:40.402
We really went in
and did a detailed analysis

08:40.504 --> 08:42.136
of the cavern.

08:42.239 --> 08:44.906
If we look at this most
recent scan of 10-X,

08:45.008 --> 08:46.508
this is the same location,

08:46.610 --> 08:48.577
same depth
through the six-inch pipe.

08:48.679 --> 08:50.579
So we're able to come in there,
look at this,

08:50.681 --> 08:53.481
I looked at the features and
as far as I can tell right now,

08:53.584 --> 08:55.483
the walls, what we interpret

08:55.586 --> 08:57.146
as to be tunnel openings
and everything,

08:57.187 --> 08:59.321
it looks pretty much
all the same.

08:59.423 --> 09:01.356
So I believe
that the sonar is giving

09:01.458 --> 09:03.658
you good interpretation
of what's there.

09:03.760 --> 09:08.163
Here's the box we've seen
in 2014.

09:08.265 --> 09:11.433
All I can say for right now,
I did not see it in the data

09:11.535 --> 09:13.768
that we collected
on this most recent scan.

09:17.441 --> 09:19.441
- It's gone.
- It's gone.

09:19.543 --> 09:22.244
This target that we had.

09:22.346 --> 09:24.946
So, John Chatterton said he
moved a rock.

09:25.048 --> 09:26.688
- Correct. Yeah.
- You think, he moved it?

09:28.885 --> 09:30.619
So that's pretty much what I
have, guys.

09:30.721 --> 09:32.354
Okay, Brian. Well, look,

09:32.456 --> 09:34.089
thank you very much,
I mean, we wanted,

09:34.191 --> 09:36.191
that's exactly what we
wanted to ascertain.

09:36.293 --> 09:37.670
- All right guys, thanks.
- Thank you, Brian.

09:37.694 --> 09:39.172
- I appreciate it.
- Thank you very much.

09:39.196 --> 09:40.440
- I appreciate it.
- Talk to you later, Brian.

09:40.464 --> 09:41.529
Yeah, have a good night.

09:43.066 --> 09:45.133
In a sense, that's the data
I wanted to hear,

09:45.235 --> 09:46.715
'cause that's
what I thought happened,

09:46.803 --> 09:49.871
but on the other, I'm
disappointed.

09:49.973 --> 09:51.784
I don't want to do
anything more in 10-X, then.

09:51.808 --> 09:55.076
I mean, how much
proving do you have to do?

09:56.980 --> 09:59.261
Well, I'm not where you are.
I'll tell you that right now.

10:00.417 --> 10:01.483
Neither am I.

10:06.432 --> 10:08.565
Ming up... anym.

10:08.668 --> 10:10.367
But that's kind of where I'm at.

10:10.469 --> 10:12.269
I mean, I think, I think
we explored 10-X.

10:12.371 --> 10:13.904
- No, no. Nope.
- Wait wait wait!

10:14.006 --> 10:15.539
Hear me out. Hear me out.

10:15.641 --> 10:18.509
I don't want to be the dog in
the manger, okay?

10:18.611 --> 10:20.878
But I also don't want to be
stupid.

10:20.980 --> 10:23.514
<i>For Rick Lagina,
the strong belief</i>

10:23.616 --> 10:25.916
<i>that something
incredible lies at the bottom</i>

10:26.018 --> 10:30.054
<i>of 10-X has found him at odds
with his brother, Marty.</i>

10:30.156 --> 10:33.390
I'd like to do an excavation
where the data points.

10:33.492 --> 10:35.225
I told you a long time ago,

10:35.327 --> 10:36.772
I don't want to walk away with
regrets.

10:36.796 --> 10:38.562
Yeah, I know that. I know that.

10:38.664 --> 10:41.398
<i>It is a situation
that doesn't happen often,</i>

10:41.500 --> 10:44.068
<i>but when it does it
poses a threat</i>

10:44.170 --> 10:46.770
<i>to the entire
Oak Island partnership.</i>

10:48.507 --> 10:51.075
<i>Dan's focus throughout
much of his 50-plus years</i>

10:51.177 --> 10:53.610
<i>on Oak Island
was the belief in 10-X.</i>

10:53.713 --> 10:55.646
You know, when you dedicate
your life,

10:55.748 --> 11:00.951
50-plus years, to one singular
goal and nothing else,

11:01.053 --> 11:03.053
he wants answers.

11:03.155 --> 11:07.891
I would like to continue
costing out some process

11:07.993 --> 11:10.294
by which we can get down
to the bottom of 10-X.

11:10.396 --> 11:11.829
Okay. Find his notes.

11:11.931 --> 11:13.230
So I'd like to follow up
on that.

11:13.332 --> 11:14.710
It's not going to cost us
any money.

11:14.734 --> 11:16.767
We quote it out, and take
a look at it.

11:16.869 --> 11:18.580
Well, that's where I'm at, I'm
just telling you.

11:18.604 --> 11:19.770
You can, you can make a face

11:19.872 --> 11:20.882
if you want to,
but that's where I'm at.

11:20.906 --> 11:22.406
I can't help it.

11:22.508 --> 11:25.075
I tend not to give up.
You know that.

11:27.847 --> 11:30.814
To paraphrase Johnnie Cochran,
O.J.'s attorney,

11:30.916 --> 11:33.650
if the box is gone,
we must move on.

11:33.753 --> 11:36.286
And that's how I feel.
I think we're done.

11:36.388 --> 11:38.922
But, I respectfully disagree.

11:39.024 --> 11:42.092
Why do you guys keep hanging
on to this thing?

11:42.194 --> 11:43.627
Because I believe.

11:46.065 --> 11:47.631
- David?
- And I'm with you.

11:47.733 --> 11:49.767
I believe there's something
there, too.

11:49.869 --> 11:51.602
Why though, David?

11:51.704 --> 11:53.344
Just to prove one way
or the other, Marty.

11:53.405 --> 11:56.507
Whether Dad was right,
or he was wrong.

11:56.609 --> 11:59.943
And I, I promised my mother
that we'd try and finish it.

12:00.045 --> 12:02.045
And I'd like to try and keep
that promise.

12:02.148 --> 12:04.715
All right. That I understand.

12:04.817 --> 12:08.185
There's a heavy-duty
emotional component to 10-X,

12:08.287 --> 12:11.622
on a variety of levels.
That's indisputable.

12:11.724 --> 12:15.726
Is it possible that what Dan saw
is now all covered in silt?

12:15.828 --> 12:19.029
Because I believe
what Dan saw is there.

12:19.131 --> 12:22.566
- What's all this about?
- This came out of 10-X.

12:22.668 --> 12:25.502
That came out of 10-X.
That came out of 10-X,

12:25.604 --> 12:27.137
and that came out of 10-X.

12:27.239 --> 12:28.906
What more do you want, Marty?

12:29.008 --> 12:32.342
Chain, wire,
and that low carbon steel,

12:32.444 --> 12:36.246
all tested out as being
made prior to 1750.

12:36.348 --> 12:38.549
All of that came from the bottom
of the damn hole.

12:38.651 --> 12:40.017
- All of those things?
- All of it

12:40.119 --> 12:41.485
came from the bottom
of the hole.

12:43.355 --> 12:46.256
Marty's got an "X" in it.
Where, where are you?

12:46.358 --> 12:48.392
I'm real close to an X.

12:48.494 --> 12:49.893
I mean, if we could do something

12:49.995 --> 12:51.829
fairly cheap to clean up
the bottom,

12:51.931 --> 12:53.397
I'd be all for that.

12:53.499 --> 12:56.433
I'm just concerned it's not
an easy thing to do.

12:56.535 --> 12:58.035
I don't know, I'm afraid
you guys are

12:58.137 --> 13:01.839
never gonna be satisfied
until you crawl down that hole.

13:01.941 --> 13:03.440
- Truth is...
- Well, you're right!

13:03.542 --> 13:04.908
- You're right.
- You and I,

13:05.010 --> 13:07.010
you and I will do it and you
and I will pay.

13:07.112 --> 13:08.579
There you go.

13:08.681 --> 13:11.915
I still am puzzled by what's in
the bottom of 10-X.

13:12.017 --> 13:14.017
Look, I'd be happy, if I could

13:14.119 --> 13:17.754
come around
to putting an X through 10-X,

13:17.857 --> 13:22.025
I'm good with that.
But not right now.

13:22.127 --> 13:24.795
I'm still enthused
about the Money Pit,

13:24.897 --> 13:30.067
but I think it's time to attack
where it started and...

13:30.169 --> 13:31.902
see what happens.

13:32.004 --> 13:34.471
I have no problem with that.

13:34.573 --> 13:37.241
Okay, then,
I say we call it a day.

13:37.343 --> 13:38.775
- Let's go.
- Okay.

13:41.747 --> 13:44.882
<i>As a new day begins
on Oak Island,</i>

13:44.984 --> 13:49.152
<i>the team's focus shifts back
to this year's key target:</i>

13:49.255 --> 13:51.555
<i>The Money Pit.</i>

13:51.657 --> 13:54.658
<i>In order to determine
if the void at the bottom</i>

13:54.760 --> 13:58.629
<i>of the C-1 shaft is large
enough, and stable enough,</i>

13:58.731 --> 14:00.664
<i>to accommodate a diver,</i>

14:00.766 --> 14:05.135
<i>Rick, Marty and the team have
invited John Chatterton</i>

14:05.237 --> 14:08.338
<i>along with dive supervisor,
Howard Ehrenberg,</i>

14:08.440 --> 14:11.942
<i>to observe
their scanning sonar operation.</i>

14:12.044 --> 14:14.311
We're all very grateful
that you've come back

14:14.413 --> 14:16.346
after all this time.

14:16.448 --> 14:19.950
Hey, you know, for us
this is another opportunity

14:20.052 --> 14:22.352
to contribute something,
so we're excited.

14:22.454 --> 14:23.798
You've got your work
cut out for you.

14:23.822 --> 14:24.922
Yeah.

14:26.558 --> 14:29.826
So here we are, I see
Blaine's here with the gear

14:29.929 --> 14:31.695
and everything's set up
ready to go.

14:31.797 --> 14:35.365
<i>To scan C-1, Rick and the team</i>

14:35.467 --> 14:38.268
<i>have invited
sonar experts Blaine Carr</i>

14:38.370 --> 14:42.673
<i>and Evan Downie to Oak Island
to utilize a relatively new</i>

14:42.775 --> 14:47.311
<i>and cutting-edge scanning
technology known as BlueView.</i>

14:47.413 --> 14:48.979
Hey, Howard. Hey, Chatterton.

14:49.081 --> 14:51.348
- Morning, guys!
- Good to see ya.

14:51.450 --> 14:54.351
<i>Unlike the previous
scanning sonar devices</i>

14:54.453 --> 14:56.186
<i>used on the island,</i>

14:56.288 --> 15:01.458
<i>the BlueView device is designed
to pan and tilt while it scans.</i>

15:01.560 --> 15:04.628
<i>This will allow it to gather
higher resolution images</i>

15:04.730 --> 15:06.463
<i>of underwater structures</i>

15:06.565 --> 15:09.166
<i>and the objects contained
within them.</i>

15:09.268 --> 15:12.035
- Okay.
- You gotta keep it vertical?

15:12.137 --> 15:13.337
- Yep.
- Okay.

15:17.843 --> 15:23.213
Make sure she's not befouled
of the cable, and... yep.

15:23.315 --> 15:24.982
I wonder if we put a board
across,

15:25.084 --> 15:26.350
and lower this off of a board.

15:26.452 --> 15:28.919
Yeah, that's a good idea.

15:29.021 --> 15:30.854
So, this drops all the
way down to the bottom,

15:30.956 --> 15:32.089
and sits on the tripod?

15:32.191 --> 15:33.857
Yep. It sits on the tripod
and then

15:33.959 --> 15:36.994
it'll scan around 360 degrees,
so it creates a 3D image.

15:37.096 --> 15:38.862
A little bit of overkill, but...

15:38.964 --> 15:40.864
No. No, it's not.
No, it's not at all.

15:40.966 --> 15:42.432
No, no such thing.

15:45.037 --> 15:48.739
All right, ready? Here goes.

15:48.841 --> 15:52.275
They're gonna connect
this survey of down hole

15:52.378 --> 15:54.344
in C-1 and hopefully,

15:54.446 --> 15:56.113
they'll give us a real
proper assessment

15:56.215 --> 15:58.081
of the size of the cavity.

15:58.183 --> 15:59.616
We're in the water.

15:59.718 --> 16:01.585
<i>And put John and Howard at ease,</i>

16:01.687 --> 16:03.053
<i>for the dive to proceed.</i>

16:03.155 --> 16:04.621
It's 100 feet coming up.

16:06.892 --> 16:08.125
160.

16:08.227 --> 16:09.760
It's recording some data.

16:09.862 --> 16:11.294
Now this is 185.

16:11.397 --> 16:13.430
We're well into the cavity,
right now.

16:13.532 --> 16:16.199
- Blaine, are we ready to go?
- We're all set, Rick.

16:16.301 --> 16:18.468
<i>Now that the sonar device is</i>

16:18.570 --> 16:21.071
<i>sitting on the bottom
of the C-1 shaft,</i>

16:21.173 --> 16:24.541
<i>some 190 feet underground,</i>

16:24.643 --> 16:28.378
<i>Blaine Carr can now
begin taking scans</i>

16:28.480 --> 16:32.215
<i>in order to build a complete
picture of the mysterious void.</i>

16:32.317 --> 16:34.718
Okay, we got a five minute scan,

16:34.820 --> 16:36.887
and everything seems
to be good so far.

16:36.989 --> 16:38.789
What have we here?

16:38.891 --> 16:41.958
That looks like there's a shaft
pointing into this.

16:42.061 --> 16:43.341
You've definitely got something.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.692
<i>NAWhat have we her p...</i>

16:51.794 --> 16:54.228
That looks like there's
a shaft pointing into

16:54.330 --> 16:55.829
this from off at an angle.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.309
So this is not the shaft
that we dropped it down.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.066
Not knowing exactly how our unit

16:59.168 --> 17:00.668
is sitting on the bottom
right now.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.102
It could be on an angle?

17:02.205 --> 17:03.815
It could be the shaft
that we just came down,

17:03.839 --> 17:05.118
and it's sitting inside a cavity

17:05.208 --> 17:06.647
right now, looking back
at the shaft.

17:06.709 --> 17:08.742
This looks pretty well
rounded out.

17:08.844 --> 17:10.810
<i>At the Oak Island Money Pit,</i>

17:10.880 --> 17:13.012
<i>sonar expert Blaine Carr,</i>

17:13.115 --> 17:16.916
<i>is obtaining BlueView
scanning sonar data of the void</i>

17:17.019 --> 17:20.221
<i>at the bottom of the C-1 shaft.</i>

17:20.323 --> 17:23.624
<i>He is trying to determine
if the void is stable enough</i>

17:23.726 --> 17:25.858
<i>to allow for professional diver,</i>

17:25.962 --> 17:29.196
<i>John Chatterton
to enter and explore.</i>

17:29.298 --> 17:31.031
Could this be the, where,

17:31.133 --> 17:33.178
the tunnel that we came down?
This could be the shaft.

17:33.202 --> 17:34.735
- Yep.
- Could be, yeah.

17:34.837 --> 17:36.804
- We just came down.
- I mean, clearly it's wider.

17:36.906 --> 17:38.472
It's way wider.

17:38.574 --> 17:40.485
If we came down this shaft,
it's definitely wider.

17:40.509 --> 17:41.809
There's definitely a cavity.

17:41.911 --> 17:43.544
But you... you've also got...

17:43.646 --> 17:45.746
Remember this is 360
degree scan,

17:45.848 --> 17:47.915
so it's not seeing what's out
on either side here.

17:48.017 --> 17:50.084
It's showing what looks
like an opening here,

17:50.186 --> 17:52.219
that looks like it went
this way, underneath.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.088
So you got your shaft,
you got an opening,

17:54.190 --> 17:55.867
and it looks like there's an
opening going right through it.

17:55.891 --> 17:58.092
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:58.194 --> 17:59.960
So you got yourself a void,

18:00.062 --> 18:02.496
and you've got something leading
off your void.

18:02.598 --> 18:04.765
<i>A second opening?</i>

18:04.867 --> 18:07.501
<i>Could the sonar scans have
revealed the existence</i>

18:07.603 --> 18:09.670
<i>of a possible man-made tunnel,</i>

18:09.772 --> 18:13.674
<i>more than 170 feet below ground?</i>

18:13.776 --> 18:16.777
<i>If so, who built it,</i>

18:16.879 --> 18:20.981
<i>and, perhaps more importantly,
where does it lead?</i>

18:21.083 --> 18:23.450
It's like from me
to as far away again

18:23.552 --> 18:25.063
as I am on the other
side of that tunnel.

18:25.087 --> 18:26.587
It's more than four feet wide.

18:26.689 --> 18:30.758
Sonar is indicating
a larger space, and in fact,

18:30.860 --> 18:35.429
it's indicating the possibility
of a void slash tunnel,

18:35.531 --> 18:39.166
coming into the space,
so it's very intriguing,

18:39.268 --> 18:42.469
but we've got further work
to do.

18:42.571 --> 18:44.805
So this is just the second scan,

18:44.907 --> 18:47.441
this isn't merged
with the other scan yet?

18:47.543 --> 18:49.843
No, No. This... I can't
do that in real-time.

18:49.945 --> 18:51.256
You can't do that here
in real-time. Okay.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.557
So, what you're looking at here,

18:52.581 --> 18:54.315
- see where the mouse cursor is?
- Yeah.

18:54.417 --> 18:58.585
That's basically the position
of the sonar.

18:58.688 --> 19:03.824
So, at the point at which you
compiled all these data sets,

19:03.926 --> 19:05.959
and then it computer models,
at that point,

19:06.062 --> 19:07.628
you'll be able to give John
and Howard

19:07.730 --> 19:10.197
a very good idea of height,

19:10.299 --> 19:11.899
width, and breadth of
the cavity.

19:12.001 --> 19:14.902
Give me three or four hours.
We'll put this together.

19:15.004 --> 19:16.970
I'll do my very best to
get it all

19:17.073 --> 19:20.874
into one cohesive package
and... present it tonight,

19:20.976 --> 19:22.387
and you guys can come up
with a plan.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.745
Look, Blaine, again,
Thank you very much,

19:24.847 --> 19:27.147
and look forward
to what you've come up with.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.249
- Great.
- Cheers, man.

19:28.317 --> 19:29.416
We'll see you later.

19:35.291 --> 19:37.558
You know, we've had a lot
of meetings in the War Room.

19:37.660 --> 19:40.761
But this one in particular
I think is most welcome.

19:40.863 --> 19:44.331
<i>At the end of another
long day on Oak Island,</i>

19:44.433 --> 19:49.002
<i>Rick Lagina and members of
the team gather in the War Room</i>

19:49.105 --> 19:53.774
<i>to find out the results
of the BlueView sonar scans.</i>

19:53.876 --> 19:56.076
Blaine. I'm hoping you've got
good news.

19:56.178 --> 19:59.046
Yeah. The data we're looking
at is basically raw data,

19:59.148 --> 20:03.417
right up out of the hole.
We did five full scans,

20:03.519 --> 20:05.919
and we've compiled them
all together.

20:06.021 --> 20:08.021
The first one here is actually
a screen capture,

20:08.124 --> 20:09.857
and what we're looking at,

20:09.959 --> 20:13.394
the perspective we have right
now is looking down the hole.

20:13.496 --> 20:17.564
The sonar allowed it
to see this opening cavity

20:17.666 --> 20:19.433
outside of your caisson.

20:21.504 --> 20:23.370
Our measurement on it,
conservatively,

20:23.472 --> 20:25.172
I would say it's about
ten feet back

20:25.274 --> 20:26.514
from the center of the caisson.

20:28.511 --> 20:30.222
So you're saying, ten feet,
pretty confident.

20:30.246 --> 20:31.879
I'm pretty confident on
the ten feet.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.692
I mean, as you can see from
the image looking

20:33.716 --> 20:36.216
straight down what looks to be
a corridor.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.385
<i>A corridor?</i>

20:38.487 --> 20:41.255
<i>Is it possible that it
was through this passageway</i>

20:41.357 --> 20:43.424
<i>that objects of great value</i>

20:43.526 --> 20:45.926
<i>were carried to their final
hiding place,</i>

20:46.028 --> 20:47.628
<i>centuries ago?</i>

20:49.231 --> 20:52.499
So, now let's just move
on to the next slide here.

20:52.601 --> 20:55.335
Did you collect enough
information to tell

20:55.438 --> 20:58.338
whether or not the tunnel was
perfectly perpendicular

20:58.441 --> 21:00.174
to the hole we dug?

21:00.276 --> 21:03.610
What of the hole I can see,
I can say, yes.

21:03.712 --> 21:05.145
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:05.247 --> 21:06.980
I can... I can tell you
right now,

21:07.082 --> 21:08.842
I don't think I can see
the end of that hole.

21:08.918 --> 21:10.150
I think that hole carries on.

21:12.555 --> 21:15.189
This could lead to a whole
other tunnel system

21:15.291 --> 21:18.692
that we've proposed could be
under Oak Island or possibly

21:18.794 --> 21:21.962
a separate treasure chamber.
We don't know that this,

21:22.064 --> 21:23.497
you know, this is the end.

21:23.599 --> 21:25.032
This could just be
the beginning.

21:25.134 --> 21:27.401
Absolutely.

21:27.470 --> 21:29.203
We're covering a lot of
ground here.

21:29.305 --> 21:31.805
Your best guess

21:31.907 --> 21:34.842
on dimensions of that chamber

21:34.944 --> 21:38.846
at the bottom of the caisson.

21:38.948 --> 21:40.314
So we're going to get
a measurement

21:40.416 --> 21:42.049
from what I think is the base

21:42.151 --> 21:45.285
of your opening
before the hammer drill,

21:45.387 --> 21:47.187
so the shoulder is what I've
been calling it,

21:47.289 --> 21:49.056
the shoulder of the ceiling.

21:49.158 --> 21:51.558
I'm going to say between six and
half to eight and half feet,

21:51.660 --> 21:53.627
saying plus or minus two feet
at this point,

21:53.729 --> 21:58.832
because of all things considered
I think is a pretty fair game.

21:58.934 --> 22:00.701
You know, I mean,
we're-we're-we're

22:00.803 --> 22:03.570
asking him
to measure with a micrometer,

22:03.672 --> 22:06.073
mark it with chalk, and then
cut it with an axe.

22:07.476 --> 22:09.209
But at the same time,
you tell me,

22:09.311 --> 22:12.379
if I'm not synthesizing
this correctly,

22:12.481 --> 22:15.015
basically it's
about seven foot high,

22:15.117 --> 22:16.884
and ten by ten.

22:16.986 --> 22:19.052
Yeah, I think that's accurate.

22:19.154 --> 22:21.421
That's a pretty good space.

22:21.524 --> 22:23.557
I mean, it's definitely,
it's definitely big enough

22:23.659 --> 22:27.494
to stack some stuff in there,
if this is what it is.

22:27.596 --> 22:30.564
<i>We would want all
the information possible;</i>

22:30.666 --> 22:32.533
There's nothing like eyes,
boots,

22:32.635 --> 22:35.702
and hands on the ground,
in that cavity.

22:35.804 --> 22:39.106
<i>So, I'm excited. I'm amped up.
I want to get going.</i>

22:39.208 --> 22:41.608
As soon as the boots hit
the bottom,

22:41.710 --> 22:45.245
pretty much for the rest
of the day, that's it.

22:45.347 --> 22:47.514
So our best visibility

22:47.616 --> 22:49.683
is going to be first thing
in the morning.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.451
I think we've got a real clear
idea

22:51.554 --> 22:55.289
of what we want to do from
a diving standpoint tomorrow.

22:55.391 --> 22:57.558
We're all on the same page?

22:57.660 --> 22:59.760
- Absolutely.
- Awesome.

22:59.862 --> 23:00.928
Okay. Here's what I think:

23:01.030 --> 23:02.429
Everybody gets some rest.

23:02.531 --> 23:04.097
Agreed!

23:10.039 --> 23:11.539
<i>N It is the beginning.</i>

23:11.641 --> 23:14.308
<i>Of what could be one of
the most important days</i>

23:14.410 --> 23:18.946
<i>in the 221-year search
for treasure on Oak Island.</i>

23:19.048 --> 23:20.815
At the end of the day today,
for me,

23:20.917 --> 23:22.283
I hope we get answers.

23:22.385 --> 23:23.884
That's our job, Howard.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.286
- That is your job.
- Answers.

23:25.388 --> 23:26.465
- There's your goal.
- Let's get some answers.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.589
Let's get some answers.

23:28.691 --> 23:30.224
What are you guys
all walking around

23:30.326 --> 23:32.226
in t-shirts
like it's summer time?!

23:32.328 --> 23:34.662
We ain't from Florida!

23:34.764 --> 23:38.132
<i>Today, renowned diver,
John Chatterton,</i>

23:38.234 --> 23:42.670
<i>will attempt to dive more
than 170 feet to the bottom</i>

23:42.772 --> 23:45.506
<i>of the C-1 shaft.</i>

23:45.608 --> 23:49.143
<i>If successful, he will
also try to locate,</i>

23:49.245 --> 23:53.247
<i>and possibly recover,
the mysterious gold-colored</i>

23:53.349 --> 23:58.119
<i>object the team saw
while drilling there last year.</i>

23:58.221 --> 24:01.021
Look, at the end, at the end
of this dive I'm hoping

24:01.124 --> 24:03.657
we'll all be completely
enthralled by what we see.

24:03.759 --> 24:05.192
- Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

24:05.294 --> 24:07.014
- That's my hope.
- The most important thing

24:07.063 --> 24:08.496
you can bring back is
information,

24:08.598 --> 24:10.197
that's that's our goal.

24:10.299 --> 24:12.967
No, the most important thing
we can bring back is you.

24:13.069 --> 24:14.602
That's first and foremost.

24:14.704 --> 24:16.248
You come, you go down the hole.
You come up the hole.

24:16.272 --> 24:18.506
Or a handful of gold coins
would be pretty close.

24:18.608 --> 24:21.175
Him first. Him first.

24:21.277 --> 24:24.345
<i>The team will be
making their initial descent</i>

24:24.447 --> 24:29.617
<i>into the 40 inch wide shaft
by means of a bosun's chair.</i>

24:29.719 --> 24:33.020
<i>It will be lowered down
C-1 by a boom crane,</i>

24:33.122 --> 24:36.957
<i>and will not only allow
the divers safe entry and exit,</i>

24:37.059 --> 24:40.961
<i>but will also enable them to
remain suspended above the clay</i>

24:41.063 --> 24:44.732
<i>that lies at the bottom
of the void.</i>

24:44.834 --> 24:47.401
The focus for getting
the video is we want to minimize

24:47.503 --> 24:50.871
the disturbance in the water,
minimize kicking up any silt.

24:50.973 --> 24:53.741
We want to make sure
that the overall integrity

24:53.843 --> 24:59.046
of that rock is safe for divers
to be down there.

24:59.148 --> 25:01.148
- All right, let's do it.
- Okay. Let's do this.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.383
Okay.

25:03.819 --> 25:06.086
Now pull forward,
just turn it hard left.

25:06.189 --> 25:07.588
Where are the zip-ties, Nick?

25:09.659 --> 25:12.159
We're going to have to
cover that in electrical tape.

25:14.463 --> 25:16.543
This is the only time I want
to come over here today.

25:16.632 --> 25:19.233
<i>Although the team has arranged</i>

25:19.335 --> 25:22.336
for emergency medical
technicians to be on site

25:22.438 --> 25:25.573
<i>at all times
during the dive operation,</i>

25:25.675 --> 25:28.542
<i>they have also taken
the extra precaution</i>

25:28.644 --> 25:31.045
<i>of obtaining a decompression
chamber,</i>

25:31.147 --> 25:33.180
<i>as the divers will be at risk</i>

25:33.282 --> 25:35.616
<i>for possible decompression
sickness,</i>

25:35.718 --> 25:39.753
<i>also known as "the bends,"
a condition</i>

25:39.855 --> 25:43.290
<i>that happens when a diver's
bloodstream becomes filled</i>

25:43.392 --> 25:45.092
<i>with nitrogen bubbles,</i>

25:45.194 --> 25:48.395
<i>caused by ascending
to the surface too quickly.</i>

25:48.497 --> 25:51.432
<i>The results can
be extremely painful,</i>

25:51.534 --> 25:54.034
<i>and may even be fatal.</i>

25:54.136 --> 25:55.881
Hopefully, you're gonna have
nothing to do all day.

25:55.905 --> 25:57.404
I hope so.

25:57.506 --> 25:59.184
Now, I got enough to run two
and half treatments,

25:59.208 --> 26:00.774
so I got lots of extra gas.

26:00.876 --> 26:02.916
Okay, so we don't have to ever
come over here today?

26:03.012 --> 26:04.445
- No. No.
- Thanks, Scott.

26:04.547 --> 26:05.813
All right. No, problem.

26:22.265 --> 26:24.105
Is he going to sit in the chair
the whole time?

26:24.166 --> 26:28.502
Yeah. Just like that.
Appears to be very stable.

26:28.604 --> 26:31.572
<i>As John Chatterton
begins final preparations</i>

26:31.674 --> 26:34.475
<i>for his momentous dive
into the C-1 shaft...</i>

26:34.577 --> 26:37.444
- Hey guys!
- Hey, Doctor Chatterton!

26:37.546 --> 26:40.981
<i>He is greeted by Marty
Lagina and Craig Tester.</i>

26:41.083 --> 26:44.118
<i>They will be monitoring
the dive operation live</i>

26:44.220 --> 26:48.088
<i>from their offices
in Traverse City, Michigan.</i>

26:48.190 --> 26:49.990
Last night, we hammered out
a dive plan

26:50.092 --> 26:52.293
that looks really solid, and...

26:52.395 --> 26:54.828
Okay, John, now, I don't want
to tell you how to dive,

26:54.930 --> 26:56.964
but if you see a shiny
gold thing

26:57.066 --> 26:58.186
would you please pick it up?

27:00.536 --> 27:01.802
<i>If you look in John's resume,</i>

27:01.904 --> 27:03.203
<i>you know, what he's done,</i>

27:03.306 --> 27:05.005
the, the technically
difficult dives

27:05.107 --> 27:06.840
he's engaged with,
he's committed.

27:06.942 --> 27:07.975
He's ready to go.

27:17.453 --> 27:18.619
Comm check John.

27:20.623 --> 27:22.790
Where's my umbilical?

27:31.667 --> 27:34.301
<i>John will be descending into C-1</i>

27:34.403 --> 27:37.037
<i>with attached umbilical cables.</i>

27:37.139 --> 27:40.174
<i>These will not only supply
a mixture of nitrogen,</i>

27:40.276 --> 27:42.543
<i>helium and oxygen into his suit,</i>

27:42.645 --> 27:46.547
<i>but also hot water which will
help to keep him warm</i>

27:46.649 --> 27:50.351
<i>in the shaft's frigid
40-degree temperature.</i>

27:50.453 --> 27:52.052
What's your temperature at?

27:52.154 --> 27:53.921
95 and still climbing.

28:00.529 --> 28:01.595
Send him up.

28:05.601 --> 28:08.902
<i>In the communications
center, dive supervisor.</i>

28:09.004 --> 28:12.339
<i>Howard Ehrenberg
will maintain constant contact</i>

28:12.441 --> 28:14.842
<i>with John during the dive.</i>

28:14.944 --> 28:17.644
<i>The team will also be able
to see what</i>

28:17.747 --> 28:21.515
<i>he sees on the live video feed
from his dive helmet.</i>

28:25.721 --> 28:28.021
Going down.

28:28.124 --> 28:30.624
- A little tight.
- Yep.

28:30.726 --> 28:32.404
There's no extra room in there,
that's for sure.

28:32.428 --> 28:33.894
No. No.

28:46.409 --> 28:47.775
All stop.

28:56.152 --> 28:59.386
Okay. We're in the water.
We just hit surface.

29:06.629 --> 29:09.062
Copy that, John.
Starting the clock.

29:12.101 --> 29:13.278
The visibility looks pretty
good.

29:13.302 --> 29:14.935
I can see your hands nicely.

29:25.514 --> 29:26.914
Visibility still good?

29:30.519 --> 29:32.197
<i>We're seeing his glove,
his dive computer;</i>

29:32.221 --> 29:33.987
<i>We're seeing the walls of
the caisson.</i>

29:34.089 --> 29:36.123
It's all looking good,
at that point.

29:36.225 --> 29:38.091
We've got clarity;

29:38.194 --> 29:41.361
He can actually put his eyes
on the target.

29:45.167 --> 29:47.501
Looks like it's getting a little
mucky down there, John.

29:53.209 --> 29:55.409
- All stop.
- All stop.

30:03.428 --> 30:05.828
<i>All stop. Coming up...</i>

30:05.930 --> 30:07.830
John, how's the visibility now?

30:13.338 --> 30:14.338
- Yes.
- Yes.

30:20.678 --> 30:21.744
Copy that.

30:24.215 --> 30:26.549
Copy that. Bring him down.

30:26.651 --> 30:28.951
<i>At the Oak Island Money Pit,</i>

30:29.053 --> 30:32.855
<i>diver John Chatterton has
successfully made his descent</i>

30:32.957 --> 30:37.627
<i>down the C-1 shaft and is now
exploring the mysterious void</i>

30:37.729 --> 30:42.031
<i>located more than 170
feet underground.</i>

30:45.236 --> 30:46.236
All stop.

30:51.709 --> 30:53.109
What are you seeing?

31:06.090 --> 31:07.556
Structurally it's good.

31:08.993 --> 31:10.893
That's excellent.
That's excellent.

31:18.870 --> 31:20.803
Yeah.
Okay, you ready to go down?

31:23.608 --> 31:26.609
Copy that. Down two feet.

31:30.982 --> 31:32.782
All stop.

31:39.257 --> 31:41.190
What's the problem?

31:47.465 --> 31:49.031
Can you see anything?

31:52.470 --> 31:56.005
That's bad visibility.
It's pea soup.

31:56.107 --> 31:57.707
Yeah.

31:57.809 --> 32:01.677
It's going to be a go by feel,
a tactile dive,

32:01.779 --> 32:06.115
and he's feeling his way,
160 plus feet underwater.

32:06.217 --> 32:08.751
That's a significant
undertaking.

32:08.853 --> 32:12.321
Get in and get out with
whatever information you can.

32:14.659 --> 32:15.958
What's going on, John?

32:21.866 --> 32:23.466
So what does the bottom feel
like?

32:26.504 --> 32:27.837
Soft clay.

32:29.273 --> 32:31.607
Can you ask him,
can he feel any water flow?

32:31.709 --> 32:35.111
So, is there any indication
of water flow down there?

32:39.250 --> 32:41.117
Copy that.
How do the walls feel, John?

32:41.219 --> 32:42.852
Do they feel irregular?

32:51.496 --> 32:52.261
Copy that.

32:52.363 --> 32:53.396
How are you doing, John?

32:53.498 --> 32:54.897
It's been like 25 minutes.

32:57.602 --> 32:58.901
Copy that.

32:59.003 --> 33:01.203
Okay, so I'm sure you heard.
He's coming up.

33:01.305 --> 33:02.872
Okay.

33:02.974 --> 33:04.907
Okay, so we're going to bring
him up to 70 feet,

33:05.009 --> 33:06.842
right now.

33:06.944 --> 33:10.046
<i>With his first dive
into C-1 completed,</i>

33:10.148 --> 33:12.381
<i>John Chatterton begins the slow</i>

33:12.483 --> 33:15.918
<i>and gradual process of
ascending to the surface.</i>

33:16.020 --> 33:18.054
How's your rate of ascent?
You like that?

33:22.026 --> 33:24.060
<i>Although he was only
able to spend</i>

33:24.162 --> 33:28.197
<i>about 25 minutes
exploring the bottom of C-1,</i>

33:28.299 --> 33:30.933
<i>the time it will take him
to reach the surface,</i>

33:31.035 --> 33:33.936
<i>and for his body
to safely decompress,</i>

33:34.038 --> 33:36.906
<i>will be almost twice as long.</i>

33:37.008 --> 33:40.743
<i>But when he resurfaces,
what will he report?</i>

33:40.845 --> 33:43.145
<i>Could he have found evidence
of the shiny,</i>

33:43.247 --> 33:45.114
<i>metallic object that Rick,</i>

33:45.216 --> 33:48.951
<i>Dave and Charles spotted
last year?</i>

33:49.053 --> 33:52.822
Everybody here believes
in that shiny gold thing.

33:52.924 --> 33:56.826
I believe that the shiny gold
thing perhaps opens the chapter.

33:56.928 --> 33:59.428
The Oak Island Mystery.

33:59.530 --> 34:01.664
I think there's a wonderful
story written here.

34:01.766 --> 34:05.301
Maybe... maybe today,
we open the first page.

34:05.403 --> 34:07.436
I've got good news and bad news.

34:07.538 --> 34:10.172
The bad news is the visibility
is terrible.

34:10.274 --> 34:13.342
The good news is there's
another hole.

34:13.444 --> 34:16.245
You know, if this diameter
is 40 inches,

34:16.347 --> 34:18.813
it's like, maybe 37, or
something like that.

34:18.916 --> 34:21.183
- You're talkin' tunnel?
- Exactly.

34:21.284 --> 34:23.619
<i>John's confirmation
that some kind</i>

34:23.721 --> 34:26.522
<i>of passageway exists
in the void at the bottom</i>

34:26.623 --> 34:31.293
<i>of C-1 offers exciting news
for the Oak Island team.</i>

34:31.395 --> 34:34.096
<i>But is it a natural formation?</i>

34:34.197 --> 34:37.766
<i>Or could it have been man-made?</i>

34:37.869 --> 34:41.203
In your opinion, I mean
you've seen rock underwater,

34:41.304 --> 34:43.472
I mean, you'd think the walls
would be smooth,

34:43.574 --> 34:44.717
and you're saying they're rough.

34:44.742 --> 34:46.375
Absolutely, not smooth.

34:46.476 --> 34:49.712
Here you could see the rough,

34:49.813 --> 34:53.382
overhead of the ceiling,
and it's solid,

34:53.484 --> 34:54.817
it's not all falling apart.

34:54.918 --> 34:56.886
It's not rotten rock,
and there are

34:56.987 --> 34:58.854
sharp edges, and all that kind
of stuff,

34:58.956 --> 35:00.534
but it's not something where
I'm concerned

35:00.558 --> 35:03.692
that the whole thing is going
to, like, cave in.

35:03.794 --> 35:07.830
The walls in C-1 did not
have the smooth feel

35:07.932 --> 35:10.666
but sort of a chipped
like texture,

35:10.768 --> 35:13.869
which is some indication
of being man-made.

35:13.971 --> 35:16.639
Could it really be a man-made
chamber?

35:16.741 --> 35:18.207
I mean, that's your first
thought.

35:18.309 --> 35:20.075
Could it be carved out?

35:20.178 --> 35:24.346
Are you comfortable at
this point exploring the cavity?

35:24.448 --> 35:27.550
I don't see anything
from an integrity standpoint

35:27.652 --> 35:29.251
that concerns me.

35:29.353 --> 35:31.754
It begs the next question,
you know, a follow up dive.

35:31.856 --> 35:33.756
- Yeah.
- What do you see happening?

35:33.858 --> 35:36.258
Well, we could metal
detect on the bottom.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.561
Perfect. Let's do it.

35:38.663 --> 35:41.864
<i>Although the team is
eager for John Chatterton</i>

35:41.966 --> 35:45.267
<i>to attempt a second dive,
for safety's sake,</i>

35:45.369 --> 35:48.037
<i>he will need to wait for an
extended period</i>

35:48.139 --> 35:51.607
<i>so that his body can
completely stabilize.</i>

35:51.709 --> 35:54.243
<i>Luckily, expert diver,
Mike Huntley,</i>

35:54.345 --> 35:57.079
<i>is on hand
to make the second dive.</i>

35:57.181 --> 35:58.614
<i>But this time,</i>

35:58.716 --> 36:01.083
<i>the emphasis will be
on trying to locate</i>

36:01.185 --> 36:03.919
<i>the mysterious metallic object.</i>

36:04.021 --> 36:06.522
Now, he'll go back down,
metal detect, okay?

36:06.624 --> 36:08.224
- Okay. Let's get wet.
- Yeah.

36:21.005 --> 36:23.105
<i>Could Mike Huntley be just</i>

36:23.207 --> 36:25.541
<i>minutes away from locating...</i>

36:25.643 --> 36:27.710
<i>and possibly recovering,</i>

36:27.812 --> 36:31.313
<i>what appeared to be a
gold-colored object discovered</i>

36:31.415 --> 36:33.549
<i>at the bottom of the C-1 shaft?</i>

36:44.062 --> 36:46.095
Copy that.
Take him down quicker.

36:49.300 --> 36:50.566
How's that?

36:53.538 --> 36:55.204
<i>As the sun threatens to end</i>

36:55.306 --> 36:57.206
<i>another day of treasure
hunting...</i>

36:58.910 --> 37:01.210
Copy that.

37:01.312 --> 37:03.713
<i>Brothers Rick and Marty Lagina</i>

37:03.815 --> 37:07.250
<i>anxiously monitor the progress
of diver Mike Huntley</i>

37:07.352 --> 37:11.153
<i>as he slowly makes his way
down the C-1 shaft,</i>

37:11.256 --> 37:15.992
<i>more than 170 feet deep below
the surface of Oak Island.</i>

37:19.831 --> 37:21.464
Copy that. You're in the cavity.

37:21.566 --> 37:24.934
<i>Armed with an
underwater metal detector,</i>

37:25.036 --> 37:28.004
<i>Mike will begin searching
for the mysterious gold-colored</i>

37:28.106 --> 37:32.375
<i>object the team recorded
video footage of last year.</i>

37:36.347 --> 37:37.513
Copy that. On the bottom.

37:38.950 --> 37:40.549
So you can't see
anything, right?

37:40.652 --> 37:42.318
Is it totally silted out
in there?

37:48.893 --> 37:50.760
Copy that.

37:50.862 --> 37:52.695
Find the shiny gold thing.

37:52.797 --> 37:53.963
Yeah.

38:08.646 --> 38:10.513
Yeah. I hear something, yeah.

38:13.318 --> 38:15.318
He's got something on
the metal detector.

38:17.655 --> 38:19.288
He's getting metal detector
hits,

38:19.390 --> 38:22.625
and that's a game changer
if it could be verified.

38:22.727 --> 38:26.028
There should be no metal
in a solution feature.

38:26.130 --> 38:29.465
That would pretty much say,
this is man-made.

38:29.567 --> 38:31.534
Is he certain of that?

38:31.636 --> 38:34.470
It's not your gears setting off
the metal detector, right?

38:34.572 --> 38:37.340
<i>Because Mike's helmet
is completely made</i>

38:37.442 --> 38:40.076
<i>of stainless steel,
he must be certain</i>

38:40.178 --> 38:43.312
<i>that his metal detector is not
getting false readings.</i>

38:49.087 --> 38:51.988
- Is he in the rubble pile?
- Are you in the rubble pile?

39:02.133 --> 39:04.600
You might try zeroing
in on the object,

39:04.702 --> 39:06.469
shutting off the metal detector,

39:06.571 --> 39:08.931
and then just reaching toward
the middle and grabbing at it.

39:29.861 --> 39:31.594
<i>A block?</i>

39:31.696 --> 39:35.564
<i>Could Mike Huntley really have
found a large, metallic object</i>

39:35.666 --> 39:39.235
<i>located at the bottom
of the mysterious void?</i>

39:39.337 --> 39:41.470
It's not on the surface
of the wall.

39:41.572 --> 39:44.040
It could be back in it.

39:58.256 --> 39:59.955
Can he get even a sliver of it?

40:14.739 --> 40:15.971
All stop.

40:24.682 --> 40:25.815
Up on slack.

40:27.685 --> 40:29.351
<i>Though we don't have orientation</i>

40:29.454 --> 40:32.254
<i>nor scale on the camera
that we put down last year</i>

40:32.356 --> 40:33.656
<i>where we see this object,</i>

40:33.758 --> 40:36.325
it appeared to everyone
that it was either

40:36.427 --> 40:38.194
in the ceiling or the wall.

40:38.296 --> 40:39.361
So, are we on that?

40:42.433 --> 40:44.533
<i>Is it possible that Mike Huntley</i>

40:44.635 --> 40:48.104
<i>has located
the strange gold-colored object</i>

40:48.206 --> 40:52.141
<i>that the team obtained
video evidence of last year?</i>

40:55.279 --> 40:59.715
<i>And, if so, could Rick,
Marty and their team be just</i>

40:59.817 --> 41:03.886
<i>moments away from finding
an important piece to a puzzle</i>

41:03.988 --> 41:07.356
<i>that treasure-hunters have
been searching for,</i>

41:07.458 --> 41:11.393
<i>and dying for,
for more than two centuries?</i>

41:11.496 --> 41:14.296
You've piqued everyone's
interest, right now.

41:14.398 --> 41:18.167
There's another one right there.

41:18.269 --> 41:20.703
Two feet away from
the other one.

41:27.311 --> 41:30.045
<i>Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...</i>

41:30.148 --> 41:32.648
We have financial constraints
at this point.

41:32.750 --> 41:35.417
We need to make a decision
today.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.453
This is a Mi'kmaq relic.

41:37.555 --> 41:40.823
The face is pointing
at Oak Island.

41:45.696 --> 41:47.163
What's that?

41:47.265 --> 41:49.598
We have hits, in the cavity
in the Money Pit.

41:49.700 --> 41:51.078
It doesn't get any better
than that.

41:51.102 --> 41:52.968
How many hits has he,
does he have?

41:53.070 --> 41:55.938
- Three hits?
- Wow, is that for real?
