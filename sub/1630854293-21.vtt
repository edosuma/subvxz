WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:04.538
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...
<i>He used to be on SWAT?</i>

00:04.638 --> 00:06.507
Deac set him up with a job
as head of security for one

00:06.607 --> 00:08.876
<i>of the big studios.</i>
I do my job and I do it well.

00:08.976 --> 00:11.379
Marcos?
Cops and good faith
don't go together.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.980
Me and you working together
ain't a good look.

00:13.081 --> 00:15.749
Never will be.
Don't think I'm gonna bail

00:15.849 --> 00:17.285
your ass out every time
you can't solve a case.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.452
Don't think
I won't pull you over

00:18.552 --> 00:20.721
if I see your
taillight out.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.180
Mr. Kay?
Yes.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.715
David Kay,
Elite Protection.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.650
Max Lewis, Junior Exec,
West Coast Events.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.119
Sorry about the wait.
We've been hearing

00:51.219 --> 00:52.886
a number of pitches
from security firms today.

00:52.986 --> 00:54.655
End of the day,
we're way behind.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.090
It's quite all right. And
my partner Owen's out of town,

00:56.190 --> 00:57.591
so I'll be the one
handling the presentation.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.427
Don't mind my asking.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.061
San Gabriel Festival
has used L.A. Gold

01:01.162 --> 01:03.364
for security the last few years.
Why, why make the change now?

01:03.464 --> 01:05.333
Eh, let's just say
there's a reason

01:05.433 --> 01:06.834
they call themselves L.A. Gold.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.469
We're set up down this way.
You got everything you need?

01:08.569 --> 01:09.837
Yeah.
Okay.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.772
I think you'll find
we offer a...

01:11.872 --> 01:14.074
high-quality security package
at a much more reasonable rate.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.645
Sanchez?

01:17.745 --> 01:19.147
All right.
What are you doing here?

01:19.247 --> 01:21.182
It looks like the same thing
you are, man.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.951
I started my own security firm
a few months back.

01:24.051 --> 01:26.787
Yeah, Deac and I
rolled together on SWAT

01:26.887 --> 01:28.489
before I decided
to pursue other ventures.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.891
You might've heard of us,
RJS Protection?

01:30.991 --> 01:33.060
Yeah, we're the ones who
ended up nabbing your video game

01:33.161 --> 01:34.228
convention client.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.763
What can I say?

01:35.863 --> 01:38.065
If you can do the job better,
and do it cheaper...

01:38.166 --> 01:41.235
I'm just joshing you.
Yeah. It's a, it's a good one.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.603
Don't want to keep them waiting.

01:42.703 --> 01:43.771
Yeah.
We'll be in touch later, man.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.105
Looking forward to hearing, Max.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.408
Oh, uh, Deac?
Good luck.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.543
You're gonna need it.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.589
Wow, that smells so good.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.424
Those the pork chops
from Tuesday?

02:03.524 --> 02:05.092
Oh, yeah, baby,
and the corn and the potatoes

02:05.193 --> 02:07.127
and the green bean casserole
Sheila dropped off.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.463
Mmm. What you can do
with other people's food,

02:09.563 --> 02:11.232
it's amazing.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.801
Your mom said she'll be here
by 7:00 in the morning.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.769
You want to drop me off on your
way in for my first day back?

02:15.869 --> 02:17.771
Baby, I'm sorry, I can't,
I got to be at the job

02:17.871 --> 02:20.007
at 5:30 in the morning
for a debrief with the Feds.

02:20.107 --> 02:22.276
They're running
some big operation.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.278
Hmm, that early?

02:24.378 --> 02:26.514
Must be important.
I don't really know
much about it.

02:26.614 --> 02:30.050
The DEA's kept it
tight under wraps.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.685
Hondo, come here.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.121
The IG sends out congratulatory
letters when an officer

02:34.222 --> 02:36.824
hits five, ten,
20 years of service.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.461
Near the bottom.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.430
40 years,
Commander Robert Hicks.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.664
Can you believe it?

02:43.764 --> 02:45.466
Hicks was sworn in
as an LAPD cop

02:45.566 --> 02:47.935
exactly 40 years ago tomorrow.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.271
Baby, I doubt Hicks wants anyone
making a thing out of this.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.839
This is no small achievement.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.508
You can't let
a milestone like this

02:54.608 --> 02:57.311
pass by without
acknowledging it.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.879
You know what, you're right.

03:00.047 --> 03:01.349
I'll text my team.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.317
I'm pretty sure we can cook up
something for tomorrow.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.518
Thank you. Yeah.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.687
<i>I had no idea</i>

03:06.787 --> 03:08.489
Sanchez had his own
private security firm.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.224
Yep, RJS Protection.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.793
I'd heard of 'em, I just never
made the connection to Sanchez.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.296
He snagged one of our
bigger clients recently.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.864
Couple smaller ones, too.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.466
I read his pitch book
he left behind.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.100
He-He's offering
cut-rate prices.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.902
I'm not sure how he's
managing to stay afloat.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.837
Doesn't sound like a recipe
for long-term success.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.739
No, and get this,
Owen reached out

03:25.839 --> 03:27.275
to some of our industry
contacts last night.

03:27.375 --> 03:30.010
Sanchez is going around town
trash talking our company.

03:30.110 --> 03:33.247
He's telling our clients that,
that I'm a full-time cop.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.983
My head's not in
the security game.
That's low.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.751
What are you gonna do?
Well, I texted him.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.287
I asked him to drop by later.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.555
Said I'd like to talk to him
about something in person.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.158
How'd it go?

03:45.259 --> 03:47.160
They're not the
friendliest bunch.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.897
So, hey, it's Hicks'
40th anniversary as a cop.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.432
What are we
thinking of doing?
Was gonna have him

03:51.532 --> 03:52.633
stop by Rocco's for a beer.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.101
Y'all could be there
to surprise him.

03:54.201 --> 03:55.903
What about that cigar lounge
down off of Pico instead?

03:56.003 --> 03:57.505
That might be
a little quiet for Hicks.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.506
You think so?

03:58.606 --> 03:59.607
20-Squad!

03:59.707 --> 04:01.342
60-Squad,
listen up.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.811
Meet DEA Agent Mack Boyle,

04:03.911 --> 04:06.380
former LAPD
Narcotics officer.

04:06.480 --> 04:10.183
Now he's the leader of the
DEA Narcotics Task Force.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.152
This is his special
response tac squad.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.288
Ace, Naomi
and Red.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.757
20 bucks if you ask
him why they call him Red.

04:18.792 --> 04:19.727
You two have
something to add?

04:19.827 --> 04:21.662
They've requested assistance

04:21.762 --> 04:23.030
on their gang sweep
this morning,

04:23.130 --> 04:24.532
so we're rolling out
with them. Sorry.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.099
Text said
5:30, right?

04:26.199 --> 04:28.302
It's 5:26.
In our
world, if you ain't

04:28.402 --> 04:29.637
15 minutes early, you're late.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.973
Every police report
filed in the past week,

04:33.073 --> 04:35.776
mapped by location.
We have a hot spot.

04:35.876 --> 04:39.012
9th Street
between Oak and Orange.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.848
Muggings, carjackings, robberies.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.316
It's a crime wave,

04:42.416 --> 04:43.451
and we know who's causing it.

04:43.551 --> 04:44.752
Los Nueves.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.153
Los Nueves are typically known

04:46.253 --> 04:47.755
as one of the more low-key gangs
in that area.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.022
Not anymore.
Ever since

04:49.122 --> 04:50.391
they got into
the heroin-dealing business,

04:50.491 --> 04:51.725
they've become
increasingly violent.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.260
Now, we have warrants

04:53.361 --> 04:55.128
on two apartment buildings
on 9th Street,

04:55.228 --> 04:57.965
where we believe the guys
are stashing their supply.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.467
<i>We're gonna serve 'em
simultaneously</i>

04:59.567 --> 05:01.535
<i>so they don't have time
to warn each other.</i>

05:01.635 --> 05:03.571
<i>There's a good chance
these guys have lookouts,</i>

05:03.671 --> 05:05.038
<i>so we're gonna get them
detained first.</i>

05:05.138 --> 05:07.307
<i>Make no mistake-- Los Nueves,</i>

05:07.408 --> 05:09.076
<i>they're just small-time dealers,
corner hustlers.</i>

05:09.176 --> 05:11.412
<i>We should be in and out
in a flash.</i>

05:11.512 --> 05:13.113
Luca.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.334
Powell.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.107
Deacon, Street,

05:40.207 --> 05:42.042
this is you.
Eyes open for lookouts.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.279
The rest on me.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.762
Hey, 30-David, heads up.
These guys are dressed

06:01.862 --> 06:03.664
for battle.
Roger that.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.999
Eyes peeled, everyone.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.343
Red, he's yours.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.278
All right, keep moving.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.901
LAPD! Gun!

06:41.001 --> 06:42.202
LAPD!
LAPD!

06:42.302 --> 06:43.236
Hands in the air!

06:43.336 --> 06:44.237
Hands in
the air!
Coming out.

06:44.337 --> 06:45.372
Don't shoot!

06:46.039 --> 06:47.374
Marcos?

06:47.475 --> 06:48.509
What are you doing here?

06:48.609 --> 06:49.843
Hands over your head!

06:50.944 --> 06:53.180
Easy, man.
What the...?

06:54.014 --> 06:55.649
Stop resisting.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.351
Come here.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.454
Check out that arsenal.

07:01.889 --> 07:02.923
These guys are arming up
for something big.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.892
Small-time dealers, my ass.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.796
Deacon, Street,
suspect in the courtyard

07:08.896 --> 07:10.664
headed for the fence.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.933
LAPD!
Don't move!

07:13.033 --> 07:13.767
Gun!

07:13.867 --> 07:15.102
Do not move.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.072
Get down!

07:20.874 --> 07:22.109
Shorty?

07:23.410 --> 07:24.512
It's Officer Street.

07:24.612 --> 07:25.879
What, you know him?
Shorty.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.348
Marcos Guzman's
little brother.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.756
You know me and Shorty
ran with the Perros.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.157
We ain't Los Nueves.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.059
You were in an apartment
leased by Leandro Garcia,

07:39.159 --> 07:40.594
a known member.
And we have a warrant.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.630
So where is he?

07:42.730 --> 07:44.732
Where is he?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.200
Hey.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.770
Shorty says that
girl's your cousin?

07:51.605 --> 07:52.706
Muriel.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.508
Only 18, with a
baby on the way.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.976
The door you
kicked down--

07:56.076 --> 07:58.078
that's her man's place. Leandro.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.280
She ain't seen him in two
days, so she's tripping.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.282
We just came to help her get
her stuff and get out of here.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.789
Get back!

08:08.889 --> 08:09.890
Stay at your posts! We got this!

08:09.990 --> 08:10.991
Let me go! It's him!

08:11.091 --> 08:12.459
It's him! Leandro!

08:12.560 --> 08:14.261
Leandro!

08:14.361 --> 08:15.462
Hey!

08:15.563 --> 08:16.564
Are you hurt?!

08:16.664 --> 08:17.898
Can you get out?!

08:19.733 --> 08:20.901
Need you to get out
of the car, slowly.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.170
Get away from the door.
Hands in the air.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.938
What's he got in his hand?
Put your other hand up!

08:25.038 --> 08:26.406
Hands up!
Put your hands up now!

08:26.506 --> 08:27.541
Leandro!

08:28.341 --> 08:30.110
Right hand!
Three fingers severed!

08:30.210 --> 08:32.112
Hey, get those
EMTs down here!

08:32.212 --> 08:33.914
Leandro, you're going
into shock. Stay with me.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.116
The Zamora cartel sent
soldiers from Mexico.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.418
They made me name names.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.955
They're gonna kill our families.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.256
There are Zamora cartel
soldiers in the U.S.?

08:43.356 --> 08:44.858
That's why the Nueves

08:44.958 --> 08:46.026
are stockpiling weapons.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.394
They're expecting the cartel.

08:47.494 --> 08:48.896
They're getting ready
for a street war.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.567
Looks like it already started.

09:31.639 --> 09:32.973
This is the work
of the Zamora cartel?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.675
They've been terrorizing
Northwest Mexico

09:34.775 --> 09:36.043
for a decade. They seized
power by gathering up

09:36.143 --> 09:38.445
all the family members
of a rival cartel,

09:38.545 --> 09:40.447
and burning 'em alive
in a pole barn.

09:40.547 --> 09:42.783
Their way of making
a statement.

09:42.883 --> 09:43.851
Sancho Zamora.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.152
Cocaine kingpin.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.820
Government's been pursuing
him for years.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.656
I heard Sancho hasn't left
Mexico since the late '90s.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.858
So why's he suddenly sending
soldiers to L.A.?

09:50.958 --> 09:52.926
Well, the Feds don't think
he did. At least, not directly.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.796
Meet Ulan Zamora,
Sancho's only son.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.998
The DEA suspects
that he's the one responsible

09:58.098 --> 09:59.667
for bringing the drugs
to the streets here.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.635
Apparently, he's trying
to expand his father's

10:01.735 --> 10:03.503
cocaine business
into black tar heroin.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.039
Think he's been working
with Los Nueves to do it?

10:06.139 --> 10:08.709
If so, the gang should be
flush with drug money.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.510
Why have they been wreaking
havoc the last few days--

10:10.610 --> 10:11.912
all-all these
muggings, robberies,

10:12.012 --> 10:13.380
like they're trying
to raise cash?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.515
Looks like Los Nueves
aren't finished yet.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.450
Got a strong-arm
robbery a half hour ago

10:17.550 --> 10:18.686
and a holdup at
a credit union.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.553
Both within a mile
or two of 9th.

10:20.654 --> 10:21.955
Powell, get on the horn
with Dispatch.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.757
Have uniformed officers
start taking a closer look

10:23.857 --> 10:26.159
at ATMs, banks,
cash-heavy businesses.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.063
You think your boy Marcos knows
more than he's letting on?

10:30.163 --> 10:31.598
It's always
a possibility.

10:31.699 --> 10:33.166
All right. Grab Luca
and take a run at him.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.768
You got it.

10:35.769 --> 10:36.804
<i>What started</i>

10:36.904 --> 10:38.939
the cartel's beef
with Los Nueves?

10:39.039 --> 10:40.407
We need to get to
the bottom of this

10:40.507 --> 10:41.809
before people get
killed, Marcos.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.811
You got about 15 Nueves
locked up, right?

10:43.911 --> 10:45.412
Ask one of them.
You were charged

10:45.512 --> 10:46.413
with resisting arrest.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.715
DEA's not releasing anyone

10:47.815 --> 10:48.849
until they get
to the bottom of this

10:48.949 --> 10:50.050
and we figure out
what's going on.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.685
Well, you see, now,
that's messed up.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.586
Me and Shorty ain't got nothing
to do with this.

10:57.124 --> 11:00.027
Ballistics came back
on the gun Shorty was carrying.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.495
It was used in an armed robbery
eight years ago.

11:02.595 --> 11:03.630
Left the store owner paralyzed.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.532
I guess Shorty somewhat matches

11:05.632 --> 11:06.767
the suspect's description.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.169
Eight years ago?
He was 12.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.637
That piece might have been
resold ten times

11:10.738 --> 11:12.272
in the last eight years.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.141
Shorty's gonna have to enter
the system to make his case.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.642
I'm sorry.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.978
If they get him on attempted,
that's 15 to life.

11:23.216 --> 11:26.553
I didn't want Shorty to run with
our crew in the first place.

11:26.653 --> 11:28.922
I knew I had to find
a way out for us.

11:29.022 --> 11:33.393
So when our cousin
found out she was having a baby,

11:33.493 --> 11:36.930
I thought now's a good chance
for us three to get away.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.498
That explains the suitcase

11:38.598 --> 11:39.833
you were helping her pack
this morning.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.401
We got an aunt in Ohio who rents

11:41.501 --> 11:43.403
a two-bedroom above her garage.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.738
Said she'd rent it to us cheap.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.339
Why were you leaving today?

11:46.439 --> 11:48.675
How'd you know
the cartel was coming?
If I tell you,

11:48.776 --> 11:50.978
will you put a word in
for Shorty?

11:51.078 --> 11:53.280
Get Muriel
in protective custody?
I'll tell you what.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.782
You tell us what you know,

11:54.882 --> 11:56.616
and we'll go pick up
Muriel ourselves.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.418
As for Shorty,
we can only promise

11:58.518 --> 12:01.822
that we'll talk to the Feds on
his behalf. I mean, we'll try.

12:01.922 --> 12:06.093
A few months back,
this vato rolls up on Shorty.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.261
Said he works for some man
down south named Z.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.898
Told Shorty he heard
our set has a rep for keeping

12:10.998 --> 12:14.868
things tight, and Z needs
a partner here in L.A.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.337
Shorty turned him down.

12:17.437 --> 12:18.738
We knew Z meant Zamora.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.407
Didn't want nothing
to do with no cartel.

12:20.507 --> 12:23.844
A while later, the Zamora cartel
and Los Nueves struck a deal.

12:23.944 --> 12:27.347
The relationship between
Los Nueves and the cartel--

12:27.447 --> 12:29.749
when'd it go sour?
Last week.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.985
Los Nueves sent
a truck full of cash to Mexico

12:32.085 --> 12:35.055
to pay the cartel
for the product they had sold.

12:35.155 --> 12:39.492
But... the truck got hit
outside of L.A.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.228
Three million gone,
just like that.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.931
So that's why Los Nueves
had been scrambling for cash.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.698
They're in debt
three million to the cartel.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.901
Which means the cartel's
gonna be coming to collect.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.103
We knew we had to
get Muriel outta there.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.172
Do you have any idea
who hit the truck?

12:52.272 --> 12:54.074
Yeah.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.978
Your boys at the DEA.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.350
I expected you earlier, Boyle.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.052
I needed to debrief my bosses.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.354
Quite the haul
this morning.
Oh, I'll say.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.722
We confiscated 53 firearms.

13:09.823 --> 13:13.693
AK-47s, AR-15s,
six sawed-off shotguns,

13:13.793 --> 13:16.263
two submachine guns,
and a machete to boot.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.765
And not to mention a dozen
or so drug dealers

13:18.866 --> 13:20.100
we got off the streets.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.002
You told us this was a
crew of common hustlers.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.770
With an arsenal like that,

13:23.871 --> 13:26.073
my officers could've been
walking into a deathtrap.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.575
If you knew this gang
was cartel-affiliated,

13:28.675 --> 13:30.077
why was SWAT kept in the dark?

13:30.177 --> 13:31.611
Because we didn't know anything.
We had a suspicion.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.546
Is that so?

13:33.646 --> 13:36.316
Because the way we heard it,
the DEA knew quite a bit.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.252
At least they knew enough
to stop a Nueve-operated truck

13:39.352 --> 13:42.822
on the I-5 carrying
a cash load of $3 million.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.561
Yeah, we didn't think anyone
knew that we had the truck

13:48.661 --> 13:50.097
and driver in custody.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.099
And that is why we couldn't
keep SWAT in the loop.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.666
We wanted to keep
the circle tight.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.202
Well, you didn't keep it
tight enough, Mack.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.769
Yeah, well, to be honest,
I was just following orders

13:56.870 --> 13:58.305
that came down from on-high.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.772
You got to love the DOJ,
always so respectful

13:59.873 --> 14:01.774
of their superiors.
Yeah, you know...

14:01.875 --> 14:03.510
No, Mack, you know...
Hold up, hold up.
There's more you ain't sayin'.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.546
The reason the DEA chose to
put the squeeze on Los Nueves

14:06.646 --> 14:08.581
and take their money.

14:08.681 --> 14:12.185
You were hoping to force
Ulan Zamora to L.A.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.721
Where'd he go to school?

14:14.821 --> 14:15.989
A place that teaches you

14:16.089 --> 14:18.158
when you force
a violent person to act,

14:18.258 --> 14:21.294
innocent folks can get
caught in the crossfire.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.967
Ulan Zamora is worth the risk.

14:27.067 --> 14:31.071
Now, by all accounts,
he is worse than his father.

14:31.171 --> 14:34.041
Whoever crosses him,
he has their families murdered.

14:34.141 --> 14:38.511
Expectant mothers, kids
hacked to pieces, put in acid.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.281
He's a first-rate sadist.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.784
Now, my bosses, they want
to nip his career in the bud

14:44.884 --> 14:46.719
before he ever
gets a grip on power.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.888
Ulan pops up in L.A.,

14:48.989 --> 14:50.991
we finally got a shot at him.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.193
And you get a nice
little feather in your cap.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.329
We all will, Sergeant.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.306
<i>Yeah, what's up, Street?</i>

15:06.406 --> 15:07.774
<i>We were headed to the hospital</i>

15:07.874 --> 15:09.276
to pick up Marcos's
cousin Muriel,

15:09.376 --> 15:10.944
but the patrol cop
assigned to protect her

15:11.044 --> 15:12.312
just told us she's missing.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.746
Somehow she vanished.
She get abducted?

15:13.846 --> 15:15.148
Not sure.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.783
The officer said Muriel
went to the ladies' room.

15:16.883 --> 15:17.917
20 minutes later,
he went to check on her,

15:18.018 --> 15:18.918
and she was gone.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.187
All units.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.821
Armed robbery
at First River Bank,

15:21.921 --> 15:24.057
521 Vermont. First unit
on scene, please advise.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.293
That's half a mile from here.
That's Nueves' territory.

15:26.393 --> 15:30.097
22-David, I'm with 26-David,
responding to the bank.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.131
Hold on, 22-David.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.565
We just got word the suspect

15:32.665 --> 15:33.833
has fled the bank
in a gray sedan.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.735
The manager slipped
a GPS tracker

15:35.835 --> 15:36.903
in the bag with the cash.

15:37.004 --> 15:37.837
Can you upload
its signal, Dispatch?

15:37.937 --> 15:39.306
We just did.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.707
It appears the suspect's
moving westbound on Mason.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.542
You guys need to change course.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.677
Already on it. Left here.
Left, left, left, left.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.748
Okay, where's
the tracker now?

15:48.848 --> 15:51.951
Arthur Avenue,
on the overpass. Hang on.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.486
Looks like they stopped.
Call you back, Hondo.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.055
Be careful.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.127
They must have
ditched the tracker.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.861
It'd be around
here somewhere. Yeah.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.067
Under the bridge.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.107
We know it's not enough.
Give us time.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.475
Don't hurt anyone else.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.514
Please, please, not my baby, no.

16:21.614 --> 16:24.451
Two for the price of one.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

16:24.551 --> 16:26.219
LAPD! Drop the weapons!

16:39.932 --> 16:41.934
He's still with us.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.037
No.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.575
Hey. Hey. Hey.

16:49.576 --> 16:52.612
Muriel. Muriel.

16:52.712 --> 16:53.980
Come on. It's okay.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.048
If we don't get them
their money,

16:55.148 --> 16:56.349
we're all in danger, okay?

16:56.449 --> 16:57.850
They're going to kill
our families.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.052
Let's get you
someplace safe, okay?

17:07.194 --> 17:09.062
What's the latest?
If the Zamora cartel's

17:09.162 --> 17:11.398
targeting families, we need
to contact every relative

17:11.498 --> 17:12.765
of Los Nueves we can trace,

17:12.865 --> 17:14.301
but it's hundreds of people.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.768
Can't protect them all.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.138
Hey, our injured <i>sicario,</i>
he say anything

17:18.238 --> 17:19.672
before he went into surgery?

17:19.772 --> 17:21.108
I asked him where the cartel's
hiding out in L.A.,

17:21.208 --> 17:23.610
but he just said,
<i>"Me van a filetear vivo."</i>

17:23.710 --> 17:26.813
Loosely translated, means
"they will filet me alive."

17:26.913 --> 17:28.481
Red and I just
managed to ID him.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.550
Turns out, he's Ulan Zamora's
right-hand man.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.252
Which means
the DEA's plan worked.

17:32.352 --> 17:36.189
Ulan's got to be here in L.A.
Gonna get this up to my boss.

17:36.289 --> 17:39.025
Thanks, Powell. Yeah.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.762
Warming up to our pals
from the DEA?

17:42.862 --> 17:47.534
At least they're on
our side now. Hey, real quick.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.703
A vice cop I know
used to work with Hicks.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.339
She tipped me off to this.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.641
"LAPD 1989 Men of the Year."

17:54.741 --> 17:56.309
Is this what I think it is?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.645
Mr. September'll make
a hell of a conversation piece

17:58.745 --> 18:01.047
honoring Hicks tonight.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.816
STREET
Oh, man. This is great.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.618
You know, I gave Buck a call.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.321
He's gonna pull together
some old Hicks stories.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.789
Greatest hits.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.090
I figure if you can't
laugh at yourself after

18:11.191 --> 18:13.593
40 years on the force,
when can you?

18:13.693 --> 18:16.529
I heard we ID'd
our cartel soldier.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.200
What're you hiding
behind your back?

18:20.300 --> 18:22.235
Nothing.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.404
Give it to me.
Don't make me.

18:24.504 --> 18:25.905
Come on, knock it off.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.846
Something you
wanna tell me, Street?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.815
Is there anything I can say
that would make this not weird?

18:35.915 --> 18:37.484
No.

18:37.584 --> 18:40.453
I spoke to Agent Boyle
on Marcos's behalf.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.121
And unless he and Shorty
have some way of

18:42.222 --> 18:45.057
turning Ulan over to the Feds,
there's no deal to be made.

18:45.158 --> 18:48.861
So you and Luca
should tell 'em.
We will.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.765
Get back to work.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.801
Yes, sir.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.670
<i>Look, Muriel,</i>

18:57.770 --> 18:59.138
I know you're scared.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.773
But becoming an accessory
to armed robbery,

19:00.873 --> 19:02.041
that wasn't the answer.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.610
Well, someone had to
try to stop them.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.846
Until the cartel
gets their $3 million back,

19:06.946 --> 19:08.147
all of our families
are in danger.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.549
It's just a matter
of who Ulan Zamora

19:09.649 --> 19:11.351
wants to punish first.

19:12.552 --> 19:16.256
I don't know how I'll ever
be free of him.
Free of Ulan?

19:16.356 --> 19:18.057
What do you mean by that?

19:22.329 --> 19:24.664
This baby is his child.

19:24.764 --> 19:28.501
Does Ulan know?
What about your boyfriend?

19:28.601 --> 19:32.205
No. That would
only make things worse.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.575
Only my cousins know.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.809
So both Marcos and Shorty,

19:36.909 --> 19:39.111
they've been keeping
the secret for you?

19:39.979 --> 19:41.948
I don't have a father.

19:42.048 --> 19:44.217
Growing up, Marcos was
the closest thing I had.

19:44.317 --> 19:47.620
Always looking out for me.
He still does.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.121
He said he was gonna
take me and Shorty

19:49.222 --> 19:51.057
across the country,
to escape all of this.

19:51.157 --> 19:55.428
Do you have any idea
where Ulan Zamora is in L.A.?

19:55.528 --> 19:56.929
When was the last time
you spoke?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.998
The night he
did this to me.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.101
Leandro's boy Rafael,

20:02.201 --> 20:05.204
he took me and Leandro
to Mexico for the holidays,

20:05.305 --> 20:08.341
said he had some business
to do with a guy named Z.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.677
That's Ulan Zamora.

20:10.777 --> 20:13.613
Rafael is the one
who cut the deal with him.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.282
Okay. What's Rafael's last name?

20:15.382 --> 20:16.583
I don't know it.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.751
I spent months

20:18.851 --> 20:21.521
thinking about what
happened that night,

20:21.621 --> 20:25.625
but I'm sure
Ulan had me drugged,

20:25.725 --> 20:27.159
and he raped me.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.128
I'm so sorry that happened, Muriel.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.030
And look at the text that was
sent right after New Year's

20:31.130 --> 20:34.334
with a picture,
it's Ulan taunting me.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.872
Thanks for this.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.876
Someone will be in to
check on you shortly.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.716
Hey. The 15 Nueves
we picked up earlier,

20:49.816 --> 20:51.851
do you know if one
of them is named Rafael?

20:51.951 --> 20:53.386
Not that I see here, why?

20:53.486 --> 20:55.888
Muriel said that one of the
gang members named Rafael

20:55.988 --> 20:57.256
is the one who cut
the heroin deal

20:57.357 --> 20:58.891
with the Zamora cartel.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.627
All right, well, if this
is the guy who made

21:00.727 --> 21:01.628
the $3 million deal
with Ulan,

21:01.728 --> 21:03.095
there's a good chance Ulan

21:03.195 --> 21:04.931
holds him responsible
for never getting paid.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.033
Have Powell track down Rafael.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.068
I'll tell the DEA.
All right, no problem.

21:09.168 --> 21:12.038
All right.
Oh, hey, Sanchez was supposed
to meet me here an hour ago.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.473
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, well, he blew me off.

21:13.573 --> 21:14.574
Now he says he's got
a ten-minute window,

21:14.674 --> 21:16.242
provided I go meet him.

21:16.343 --> 21:19.245
Don't go easy on him.
Oh, don't you worry.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.053
<i>Listen to me, Shorty.
The Feds say</i>

21:27.153 --> 21:28.721
unless you can deliver
Ulan Zamora to them

21:28.821 --> 21:29.989
on a silver platter,

21:30.089 --> 21:32.191
there's no deal.
Ain't no way, man.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.226
You said you'd help us
if I helped you.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.095
We said we'd try.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.433
I know how we could get to Ulan.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.001
Wait, what're you talking about?

21:42.101 --> 21:43.202
If I tell you this,
I won't be safe.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.104
You won't be safe
in here either.

21:48.775 --> 21:51.978
If Shorty talks, can you keep
him out of general population?

21:52.078 --> 21:53.880
Yeah, we'll make arrangements
to get him his own cell

21:53.980 --> 21:55.548
as soon as we walk outta here.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.684
You'll be safe, Shorty.

22:01.187 --> 22:02.622
It's okay.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.290
Find the number to
J's Used Car Lot.

22:04.391 --> 22:07.226
When I turned down that vato
from the cartel two months ago,

22:07.326 --> 22:10.830
he said if we changed our minds,
to call the same number as J's,

22:10.930 --> 22:14.100
except the last digit
on his number was a six.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.503
Even if we get in touch with
this guy, what're we gonna say?

22:16.603 --> 22:19.406
We only have one carrot
to dangle in front of Ulan

22:19.506 --> 22:21.073
that I can think of.

22:21.173 --> 22:24.176
He's about to become a father,
and doesn't know it.

22:25.412 --> 22:27.547
Muriel told you?
She told Deacon.

22:27.647 --> 22:28.781
Now we take it to the Feds,

22:28.881 --> 22:30.450
we see if there's
a deal to be made.

22:30.550 --> 22:33.152
Get me outta here, Marcos.

22:33.252 --> 22:37.023
Whatever you got to do, bro.
Just get me out.

22:40.026 --> 22:43.563
So none of the Nueves in custody
are gonna help us ID Rafael?

22:43.663 --> 22:45.231
He's got to be
Ulan's next target.

22:45.331 --> 22:47.333
They're probably hoping
he already split.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.368
We've been trying to reach out
to every family member we can,

22:49.469 --> 22:51.037
but a lot of their phones
have been turned off.

22:51.137 --> 22:53.239
I'm afraid we're
coming up short.

22:53.339 --> 22:55.107
You think the cartel
got to them?
Don't know.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.009
Powell's keeping a log
of when and where

22:57.109 --> 22:59.211
the phones went dark.
All right.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.013
Oh, and, Hondo,

23:01.113 --> 23:03.483
I got it on good authority
that today's significance

23:03.583 --> 23:07.454
in my career is not lost on you,
and that there may be some sort

23:07.554 --> 23:08.688
of gathering in the works.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.190
Sir, 40 years on the LAPD,

23:11.290 --> 23:12.459
that's something
to be real proud of.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.194
Well, this isn't about pride.

23:15.294 --> 23:17.597
Barb hated the thought
of me working this job

23:17.697 --> 23:18.898
into my 60s.

23:18.998 --> 23:22.334
So 15 or so years ago,
I cut her a deal.

23:22.435 --> 23:25.772
I told her when I hit my
40th anniversary as a cop,

23:25.872 --> 23:28.074
I'd retire.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.309
So in an alternate version
of my life,

23:30.409 --> 23:32.445
if she were still alive,

23:32.545 --> 23:34.981
we'd probably be off
to Jamaica right about now.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.016
Commander, what I remember
of Barb is

23:37.116 --> 23:38.585
she'd just want you to be happy,

23:38.685 --> 23:40.853
Well, I am happy.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.389
And I'm not going
anywhere either.

23:43.490 --> 23:48.394
No, celebrating today
just makes me think about

23:48.495 --> 23:51.030
what I've lost,
so whatever you're planning,

23:51.130 --> 23:53.533
I'm asking you
to call it off.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.768
It's just another reminder
that I'm closer

23:55.868 --> 23:58.204
to the end than the start.

23:58.304 --> 24:00.072
Okay?

24:05.778 --> 24:07.346
Thanks for carving time
out of your schedule

24:07.446 --> 24:09.582
to meet me.
Anything for an old friend.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.851
All right, so you said you want
to discuss something in person?

24:11.951 --> 24:13.252
Yeah. We need to
get something straight.

24:13.352 --> 24:15.187
Owen has heard
from multiple sources

24:15.287 --> 24:17.156
that you've been dumping on our
security company in meetings,

24:17.256 --> 24:19.859
disparaging my work ethic.
Easy, tiger.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.293
I never disparaged anything.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.462
Telling clients that
my head's not really in it,

24:23.563 --> 24:24.764
that I'm a full-time cop.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.265
Well, that part's true,
isn't it?

24:26.365 --> 24:28.901
I mean, it's not like the
security firm's a top priority

24:29.001 --> 24:30.202
for either one of you.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.538
You have SWAT,

24:31.638 --> 24:33.139
and from what I've heard,

24:33.239 --> 24:34.774
Owen's playing a lot of golf
in Florida.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.876
Look, it's one thing
to snag a client

24:36.976 --> 24:38.344
by beating us
fair and square,

24:38.444 --> 24:40.880
but to do it by tearing us
down, that is unethical.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.448
Come on, Deac, man,
this isn't personal,

24:42.549 --> 24:43.616
it's business.

24:43.716 --> 24:44.951
Well, I'd rather
lose my business

24:45.051 --> 24:46.786
than to make money
doing it like that.

24:46.886 --> 24:49.556
Have fun working the music
festival for your new client.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.591
Yeah, we didn't get
the contract. L.A. Gold did.

24:51.691 --> 24:54.260
I'm sure that makes you
at least a little happy.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.764
Take it easy, Deac.

24:57.864 --> 25:01.033
Okay, if this guy answers,
everything you got to say

25:01.133 --> 25:02.969
is laid out right here.
Yeah, I got it.

25:03.069 --> 25:04.637
I tell him I'm
Muriel Guzman's cousin.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.606
She's pregnant with Ulan's baby,
and needs to see him tonight.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.575
Okay, the cartel are gonna want
to take control of the meeting,

25:08.675 --> 25:12.078
so whatever location they pick,
just agree to meet Ulan there.

25:12.178 --> 25:15.381
Phone company says the number's
active, but untraceable.

25:15.481 --> 25:16.583
You ready?

25:16.683 --> 25:18.951
Not until I know we got a deal.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.853
Commander's working on it still.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.454
Then I ain't calling no one.

25:22.555 --> 25:24.123
Offer from the DEA.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.926
They drop your resisting
arrest charge, and when Ulan

25:27.026 --> 25:29.929
is captured, you enter Witsec,
with a healthy stipend to boot.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.463
Shorty, too, right?

25:31.564 --> 25:32.999
They only agreed to let Shorty
enter witness protection

25:33.099 --> 25:34.934
if he's cleared of
the charges against him.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.302
That'll take months.

25:36.402 --> 25:39.338
And how do we know he'll
be cleared, huh? No way.

25:39.438 --> 25:42.008
If Shorty ain't
part of it, no deal.

25:43.743 --> 25:46.045
Commander, you mind if we,
uh, try to twist Boyle's arm?

25:46.145 --> 25:48.514
Be my guest.
Come on. Let's go.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.284
Nice work, gentlemen.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.920
At this rate,
we'll have Ulan locked up

25:54.020 --> 25:55.221
and still be home for supper.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.489
I'll be upstairs
monitoring the call.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.759
The deal the Feds
are offering Marcos,

25:59.859 --> 26:01.661
it's got to include
his brother Shorty.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.630
Shorty Guzman's
facing serious charges.

26:03.730 --> 26:04.931
There's a legal process.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.465
Eight years ago,
Shorty was 12,

26:06.565 --> 26:08.701
and a foot shorter than the
suspect the witness described.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.069
It wasn't him.

26:10.169 --> 26:12.271
Now, Shorty is helping Marcos
inform on the heir

26:12.371 --> 26:14.106
to a ruthless cartel.
Yeah, you tell Marcos

26:14.206 --> 26:15.675
we're making a deal
with him,

26:15.775 --> 26:17.209
not every relative that
ever got a speeding ticket.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.378
Have him make the damn call. No.

26:19.478 --> 26:23.049
Marcos won't do it unless
Shorty's included in the deal.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.918
Well...

26:26.018 --> 26:28.120
I will resubmit the paperwork,

26:28.220 --> 26:30.189
but even if the
higher-ups agree,

26:30.289 --> 26:32.358
it'll still be over an hour
for the offer to be redrawn.

26:32.458 --> 26:34.994
In the meantime, let's get
this show on the road

26:35.094 --> 26:37.263
while Ulan's still in town.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.041
He ain't gonna pick up.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.076
Just give it a sec.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.680
<i>¿Quién es?</i>

26:54.814 --> 26:56.248
This is Marcos Guzman.

26:56.348 --> 26:57.917
I'm Muriel Guzman's cousin.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.919
Muriel knows a friend
of yours named Z.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.420
She got some news a while back

27:01.520 --> 27:03.956
that she's having a baby
and Z's the dad.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.591
She thought he'd want to know.

27:05.692 --> 27:07.526
Who the hell
did you say this is?

27:07.626 --> 27:09.328
Text him the photo.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.030
Marcos Guzman.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.165
Check your phone.
Just sent you a text.

27:13.265 --> 27:15.501
What's she want? Money?

27:15.601 --> 27:16.903
She wants to meet Z
and talk it out.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.404
Well, that's not gonna happen.

27:18.504 --> 27:19.505
Not till you go through me.

27:19.605 --> 27:21.140
All right.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.208
Where and when?

27:22.308 --> 27:23.509
There's an old machine shop

27:23.609 --> 27:24.777
on the corner
of Santa Ana and Hill.

27:24.877 --> 27:27.279
30 minutes.
Just you and the girl.

27:28.815 --> 27:31.017
Paperwork better be ready
for me to sign when I get back.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.985
I just got word
from the deputy warden.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.287
They're moving Shorty
to a single-room cell.

27:35.387 --> 27:36.655
He's gonna be safe.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.564
Open six!

27:51.103 --> 27:53.505
Not sure whose ass
you've been kissing,

27:53.605 --> 27:55.541
but enjoy, cupcake.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.878
Close six!

28:07.353 --> 28:09.756
We need ears inside. It's the
only way we can keep you safe.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.623
Now, the recorder's built
into the button.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.692
Just try not to think about it.

28:13.793 --> 28:14.961
Powell, what's up?

28:15.061 --> 28:16.963
This Rafael we've
been trying to find.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.831
The Nueve who brought
Muriel to Mexico

28:18.931 --> 28:20.199
and cut the deal with Ulan.

28:20.299 --> 28:21.667
We think we ID'd him.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.669
His name is Juan Rafael Perez.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.437
You sure it's the right guy?
100%.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.806
We've been reverse-image
searching

28:26.906 --> 28:27.874
Muriel's picture of him.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.341
Finally hit his social media.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.210
All right,
send unis to scoop him up.

28:31.310 --> 28:32.678
We tried. He's gone.

28:32.779 --> 28:34.847
Checked his place,
called his sisters,

28:34.947 --> 28:36.648
his mother's restaurant
in Southgate.

28:36.749 --> 28:38.350
We can't find him or his family.

28:38.450 --> 28:41.020
The Zamora cartel's
infamous for holding grudges.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.389
If Rafael's the guy who
personally cut the deal

28:43.489 --> 28:44.857
with Ulan--

28:44.957 --> 28:46.192
All right,
let's just pray that Rafael

28:46.292 --> 28:48.394
and his family are
hunkered down somewhere.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.029
Keep us posted.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.231
I'll fill you in later.

28:52.331 --> 28:54.666
When this guy sees
Muriel ain't with me,

28:54.767 --> 28:56.035
won't he know something's up?

28:56.135 --> 28:58.204
You just tell him that
Muriel wants to meet Ulan.

28:58.304 --> 28:59.505
No one else.

28:59.605 --> 29:01.140
Once this guy trusts you
are who you say you are,

29:01.240 --> 29:03.142
that's when you ask
about Ulan's whereabouts.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.676
Now, he's not gonna give you
a straight answer,

29:04.777 --> 29:06.678
but you keep your cool,
you keep him talking.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.848
He's bound to give something up.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.016
All right, you know
where you're headed.

29:10.116 --> 29:11.350
Half a block down the street.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.185
Now, the DEA is listening in,

29:13.285 --> 29:15.354
Street and Luca are
posted up just outside

29:15.454 --> 29:16.522
in the back alley.

29:16.622 --> 29:18.057
Now, if anything goes sideways,

29:18.157 --> 29:20.392
you work the word "Domingo"
into the conversation,

29:20.492 --> 29:21.727
they'll move in.

29:21.828 --> 29:23.362
Just remember to try
and stay calm.

29:24.663 --> 29:27.166
Yeah. I'm straight.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.334
I'm good.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.136
Go.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.246
Is he headed in?

29:40.346 --> 29:41.680
As we speak.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.971
<i>Bueno.</i> Follow me.

30:15.281 --> 30:17.149
Where's the girl?

30:18.050 --> 30:19.051
She wants to meet Ulan.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.252
I bet she does.

30:20.352 --> 30:21.553
He clean?

30:21.653 --> 30:23.522
He's not packing, Armando.

30:23.622 --> 30:25.224
He wearing a wire?

30:27.860 --> 30:29.761
Gonna have to search you.

30:30.796 --> 30:31.830
Take off your clothes, <i>chico.</i>

30:31.931 --> 30:33.065
What'd you say to me?

30:33.165 --> 30:34.333
He says we
need to search you.

30:34.433 --> 30:35.367
Relax.

30:35.467 --> 30:36.535
It's just how we do things.

30:36.635 --> 30:37.904
Look, I got a scared
cousin out there

30:38.004 --> 30:39.238
who wants to talk
to her baby's father.

30:39.338 --> 30:40.940
Where's he at?
He's playing anger.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.274
That's a risky move.

30:42.374 --> 30:43.775
Yeah. Should we pull him?
No. No, not yet.

30:43.876 --> 30:45.511
We can't lose our shot
at Ulan Zamora.

30:45.611 --> 30:47.446
You think I'm some punk, huh?

30:47.546 --> 30:48.480
Take it easy.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.082
No, you take it easy, ese.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.620
Keep your pants on.

30:54.720 --> 30:55.854
I believe you.

30:55.955 --> 30:58.524
I told Ulan what you told me.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.459
He remembers the girl.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.028
He wants to know what she wants.

31:02.128 --> 31:03.829
She wants him to know
he's having a son.

31:03.930 --> 31:07.099
<i>Oye esto, jefe.</i>

31:10.702 --> 31:12.438
Ulan has just arrived
into town.

31:12.538 --> 31:13.505
He wants to meet her.

31:13.605 --> 31:14.740
Get her here. We'll take you.

31:14.840 --> 31:15.841
Where's he at?

31:15.942 --> 31:17.109
He has some business he wants

31:17.209 --> 31:19.078
to personally handle first.

31:26.752 --> 31:28.287
Domingo!

31:28.754 --> 31:30.322
Luca, Street. Move in!

31:36.095 --> 31:38.330
LAPD! Hands!

31:38.430 --> 31:39.798
Get over! Get over!

31:39.898 --> 31:41.433
Don't move.
Get over.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.035
Give me your hands.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.839
Deceased male, GSW to the chest.

31:47.940 --> 31:48.975
Grab his phone.
He just called Ulan Zamora.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.409
We got his number.

31:50.509 --> 31:53.912
Powell. Texting you
Ulan's number.

31:56.983 --> 31:59.251
We're uploading it now.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.553
The scrambler Ulan's
using won't let us

32:01.653 --> 32:03.789
narrow his location
past a square mile.

32:03.889 --> 32:05.557
Looks like he's in Southgate.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.159
That Rafael guy in the wind,

32:07.259 --> 32:08.961
where'd you say his
mother's restaurant was?
Southgate.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.066
Faster.

32:17.403 --> 32:18.937
Please, no!

32:20.206 --> 32:22.574
Why are you doing this?

32:22.674 --> 32:24.210
Ask your son.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.747
What do we know?

32:28.847 --> 32:30.216
Two entrances
on the three side.

32:30.316 --> 32:31.317
Blue pickup
down the block.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.485
Ulan's in there.
This is it.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.521
You all ready to do this?

32:35.621 --> 32:37.323
Let's go.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.701
Red, clear right side.
Got it.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.104
Ace, Naomi, one side.

32:54.540 --> 32:57.609
Stand up, Rafael.

32:59.945 --> 33:01.547
Tell me...

33:01.647 --> 33:03.415
where's my $3 million?

33:03.515 --> 33:04.883
I don't know.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.319
I don't know.
I swear to you, Ulan.

33:07.419 --> 33:10.389
Just leave my family
out of this.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.458
You brought them into this

33:12.558 --> 33:15.561
by making a deal
with someone like me.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.829
We all have family, Rafael.

33:17.929 --> 33:20.232
You shame me before my father,

33:20.332 --> 33:23.035
my family...

33:23.135 --> 33:26.004
now I do the same to you.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.376
You do the honors.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.211
No, no. Please.

33:32.311 --> 33:33.412
Please.

33:34.513 --> 33:35.981
Don't make me, please.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.949
Please...

33:38.050 --> 33:40.119
Activating.

33:40.219 --> 33:41.453
Powell.

33:47.326 --> 33:49.828
Red, stay back, cover the door.
You got it.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.070
Hold.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.040
I got eyes on Ulan Zamora.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.876
Two other armed men,
looks like seven hostages.

34:04.976 --> 34:07.313
We got to get closer
before we advance.

34:07.413 --> 34:08.914
Boyle, cover the kitchen.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.566
No?

34:32.271 --> 34:34.506
You hear something?

34:35.274 --> 34:36.508
Heads up, Boyle.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.844
Armed suspect coming your way.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.756
DEA. Don't say a word.

34:50.856 --> 34:51.823
Red, I need cover.

34:51.923 --> 34:53.625
Do you smell lighter fluid?

34:54.493 --> 34:55.361
<i>¡Levantense!</i>

34:55.461 --> 34:57.363
Go. LAPD!

34:57.463 --> 34:58.564
On the ground!

35:03.602 --> 35:05.137
It's all right. Stay down.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.852
Ulan's in the closet. I got him.

35:21.653 --> 35:22.921
You got no one.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.661
Suspect down.

35:29.761 --> 35:32.130
Ulan Zamora is down.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.142
Hey, here's the good news.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.011
The owner says we could
eat here for free for life.

35:46.111 --> 35:48.780
Hope she knows how hungry we
get after a 12-hour shift.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.582
What's the bad news?

35:50.682 --> 35:51.650
Who said there was bad news?

35:52.851 --> 35:53.919
How'd things go with Sanchez?

35:54.019 --> 35:56.054
I said what I needed to say.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.023
He explain himself?
I guess I didn't
really give him a chance.

35:58.123 --> 36:00.826
I got so worked up hearing
that he was badmouthing

36:00.926 --> 36:02.428
the company
I'd worked so hard for.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.363
Here I thought he was gonna
come to you, hat in hand,

36:04.463 --> 36:06.031
to apologize.

36:06.131 --> 36:08.066
You know, Sanchez does have
a lot to offer in his own way,

36:08.166 --> 36:10.336
but he could learn a few things
from a guy like you.

36:13.439 --> 36:15.207
I'll catch up to you.

36:15.307 --> 36:18.076
Truly thought I was
about to meet my maker.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.746
You're still here, aren't you?

36:28.220 --> 36:29.521
Hey, baby.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.257
Hey, before I take off,
do you want me to pick up

36:31.357 --> 36:32.958
a bottle of scotch
for you to give

36:33.058 --> 36:34.326
to Hicks at your get-together?

36:34.426 --> 36:35.661
No, there's no need.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.863
Hicks found out
and he blew it all up.

36:37.963 --> 36:39.698
He says celebrating
40 years on the force

36:39.798 --> 36:41.199
just reminds him
of what he's lost.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.401
Well, that's a shame.

36:42.501 --> 36:43.402
He's missing out.

36:43.502 --> 36:44.770
So are you guys.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.104
I mean, people don't always
get a chance

36:46.204 --> 36:48.240
to express what someone
means to them.

36:48.340 --> 36:51.277
A day like today
is about thanking someone

36:51.377 --> 36:54.079
who's always done his best
to have your back.

36:54.179 --> 36:55.947
You know, baby, you're right.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.149
Yeah, go ahead and pick up
that scotch.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.951
I'll see you there.

37:09.027 --> 37:12.564
Heard you got picked up
in that bust this morning.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.900
You a Nueve?

37:15.000 --> 37:16.802
I hear you
ain't a Nueve.

37:16.902 --> 37:19.004
Yo, let me be, man.

37:20.005 --> 37:23.775
I hear you been talking
to the cops this morning.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.244
Been getting treated
real good, too.

37:26.345 --> 37:27.746
Have 'em treat this.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.350
What's up now?
Everybody hit the wall!

37:31.450 --> 37:32.684
Go on, hit the wall!

37:32.784 --> 37:34.286
I need a medic!

37:37.088 --> 37:38.223
<i>They just want us here</i>

37:38.324 --> 37:39.491
till you sign
all the paperwork,

37:39.591 --> 37:40.492
then you're free to go.

37:40.592 --> 37:41.660
And Shorty?

37:41.760 --> 37:42.928
He'll be transferred out

37:43.028 --> 37:44.430
soon as we send it
over to the jail.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.167
Can I see you two for a second?

38:00.979 --> 38:02.714
There's no easy way to say this.

38:02.814 --> 38:05.384
Uh, Shorty Guzman's
been murdered.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.285
Murdered? What?

38:07.386 --> 38:09.220
How? By who?

38:09.321 --> 38:10.589
We had them put him
in his own cell.

38:10.689 --> 38:11.957
Apparently he was moved.

38:12.057 --> 38:12.924
We're working to get
to the bottom of it.

38:13.024 --> 38:14.860
I promise, we will.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.963
Red is gonna break
the news to Marcos.

38:19.264 --> 38:21.433
I, uh...

38:21.533 --> 38:22.768
regret to inform you that

38:22.868 --> 38:24.870
your brother Shorty
has been killed.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.907
Wait, what?

38:29.841 --> 38:31.777
I'm sorry.

38:47.593 --> 38:48.760
I need to go back
and talk to him.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.729
I think you better not.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.733
You said he would be safe.

38:56.535 --> 38:58.169
You said my brother'd be safe!

38:59.905 --> 39:02.073
You killed him!

39:15.954 --> 39:17.523
Good night, fellas.

39:17.623 --> 39:18.924
Good night.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.535
I hope you know
I didn't drive here

39:29.635 --> 39:31.637
so that you could read me
the riot act again.

39:31.737 --> 39:34.039
No, I-I know.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.373
I stand by what I said,

39:35.474 --> 39:37.375
but that's not why
I asked you to come.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.210
You know, I've been
thinking a lot about

39:39.310 --> 39:41.913
what you've been able to pull
off these last few months.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.849
Starting a company from scratch.

39:43.949 --> 39:46.084
And, uh, I got to say,
it takes guts.

39:46.184 --> 39:48.386
And the ability to rub elbows
that not a lot of people have.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.321
What're you getting at, Deac?
Well, I was thinking.

39:50.422 --> 39:52.123
With your contacts in
the entertainment world,

39:52.223 --> 39:55.827
and my early access
as an active SWAT sergeant,

39:55.927 --> 39:57.362
to security conventions,

39:57.463 --> 39:59.531
we'd make
a pretty unbeatable team.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.833
What are you talking about?
Like a company merger?

40:05.971 --> 40:08.640
Okay, this is not
what I was expecting.

40:08.740 --> 40:09.941
We obviously have
our differences.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.543
But...

40:11.643 --> 40:13.679
I really think that
if we partnered up,

40:13.779 --> 40:15.080
we would do things ethically,

40:15.180 --> 40:18.049
we'd win contracts
with our own merits,

40:18.149 --> 40:21.086
do things the way we-we
try to do things here at SWAT.

40:21.186 --> 40:22.654
The right way.
What about Owen?

40:22.754 --> 40:25.557
You still have
a partner, remember?
Like you said,

40:25.657 --> 40:27.092
Owen takes a lot of golf trips.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.426
I have a feeling that

40:28.527 --> 40:29.495
he'd jump at the chance

40:29.595 --> 40:30.896
to become a minority owner.

40:30.996 --> 40:33.865
Sanchez, this could
be a game changer.

40:33.965 --> 40:35.100
For both of us.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.102
Different skills...

40:37.202 --> 40:39.538
but I really believe that
we'd complement each other.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.907
Just need to iron out
some details.

40:42.007 --> 40:43.141
When can you get started?

40:43.241 --> 40:44.242
How about tomorrow?

40:44.342 --> 40:46.244
I was hoping you'd say that.

40:46.344 --> 40:47.846
Okay.

40:52.851 --> 40:55.186
Surprise!
Surprise!

40:56.121 --> 40:58.456
Ah...
Congratulations.

40:58.557 --> 41:02.293
40 years on the force.
What an achievement.

41:02.393 --> 41:04.530
Oh, wow.

41:04.630 --> 41:06.865
Well, to be honest,
I had a lot of moments

41:06.965 --> 41:08.033
along the way where...

41:08.133 --> 41:09.467
I didn't think I'd make it.

41:09.568 --> 41:10.802
And I should've known

41:10.902 --> 41:12.538
you don't always listen
to your superiors.

41:12.638 --> 41:15.206
Only the ones who scare me.

41:15.306 --> 41:18.510
Commander, seriously,
I just wanted to say,

41:18.610 --> 41:20.378
I've been fortunate
to have a few good mentors

41:20.478 --> 41:22.380
in my professional life
who've shown me the ropes,

41:22.480 --> 41:24.683
taken me under
their wings, but...

41:24.783 --> 41:27.719
everything I've learned
about being a public servant,

41:27.819 --> 41:29.154
I mean a true public servant,

41:29.254 --> 41:30.889
I've learned from you.

41:33.525 --> 41:36.862
Congratulations on
40 damn fine years.

41:36.962 --> 41:38.363
Thanks, Hondo.

41:38.463 --> 41:39.297
That means a lot.

41:39.397 --> 41:40.899
Yeah.
But if you two think

41:40.999 --> 41:42.868
I'm sharing any of this scotch
with you,

41:42.968 --> 41:45.070
you got another thing coming.

41:50.909 --> 41:52.377
Surprise!

41:53.278 --> 41:54.580
Damn it!
