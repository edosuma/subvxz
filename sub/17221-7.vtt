- RACIST.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.778
- NOPE. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO FIND SOMEONE WHO KNOWS CSL--

07:57.811 --> 07:58.679
CHINESE SIGN LANGUAGE.

07:58.712 --> 08:02.015
- UGH, OKAY.
OKAY, ANOTHER CONTINUANCE.

GET ME SOMEONE WHO CAN SIGN CSL,

AND A LAWYER WHO CAN SPEAK
BOTH ENGLISH AND MANDARIN,

08:07.087 --> 08:09.222
SO WE DON'T GET TRIPPED UP
ON LEGAL TERMS.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.258
AND, YOU COME BACK,
JUST IN CASE.

08:11.291 --> 08:14.595
AND WE NEED A STENOGRAPHER WHO
CAN TAKE TRANSCRIPT IN MANDARIN.

08:14.628 --> 08:15.629

08:15.663 --> 08:18.699
THAT'S "I GOT YOU COVERED,
JUDGE" IN MANDARIN.

08:18.732 --> 08:19.867
- OKAY, JUDY,
HOW DO YOU KNOW MANDARIN?

08:19.900 --> 08:22.570

08:28.809 --> 08:30.644
- HUH.

08:30.678 --> 08:31.779
[knocking on door]

08:31.812 --> 08:32.613
- JUDGE HERNANDEZ.

08:32.646 --> 08:33.914
IF YOU CAME TO YELL
AT JUDGE WRIGHT,

08:33.947 --> 08:35.148
SHE IS NOT HERE.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.784

08:36.817 --> 08:38.852
YOU'RE A STYLISH FELLA,

08:38.886 --> 08:41.088
AND, WELL, I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU COULD GIVE ME SOME POINTERS

08:41.121 --> 08:42.089
FOR MY PORTRAIT.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.691
- YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, WELL, YEAH.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.692
LET'S--

08:48.629 --> 08:50.664
IN THE RIGHT SUIT--IF YOU'RE
OKAY WITH, I DON'T KNOW,

08:50.698 --> 08:54.902
MAYBE TRYING A TIE--
THE NON-BOLO VARIETY.

08:54.935 --> 08:55.903
- I COULD TRY THAT.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.105
- GET SOME OF THE FACIAL HAIRS,
LIKE, COMBED UP.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.674
AND MAYBE THREAD
THE RANDOM EYEBROWS

09:00.708 --> 09:02.342
THAT'S GROWING ON THE BRIDGE
OF YOUR NOSE. IT'S--

09:02.375 --> 09:05.178
- WELL,
MY WIFE HAS MENTIONED THOSE.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.747
- MM-HMM.
- WELL, THANK YOU, TEDWARD.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.116
REALLY, IT'S--IT'S
THREE VERY USEFUL SUGGESTIONS--

09:09.149 --> 09:10.851
- HEY, HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?
WE'RE NOT DONE YET.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.620
LET ME--LET ME JUST LOOK
OVER RIGHT HERE REAL QUICK.

09:12.653 --> 09:13.520
- WHAT?

09:13.553 --> 09:14.722

THAT'S NICE, MAN.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.729
- YEAH, WE'RE ALMOST EYE TO EYE.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.098
- WAIT.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.767
YOU'RE GOING AWAY FOR A NIGHT
WITH GARY?

09:26.800 --> 09:27.901
- MM-HMM.
- ALL RIGHT.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.037
YOU UNDERSOLD HOW SERIOUS
YOU TWO ARE.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.839
- SERIOUS?
NO, WE'RE GOING TO A HOTEL.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.841
THAT'S WHERE PROSTITUTES TAKE
THEIR JOHNS.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.809
- WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE
IT'S GETTING SERIOUS.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.177
HE'S INVITING YOU AWAY.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.713
YOU'RE ACTUALLY FOLDING
YOUR CLOTHES.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.249
AND I SAW HOW JEALOUS YOU GOT
WHEN HE WAS DANCING

09:42.282 --> 09:43.617
WITH THAT OTHER LADY.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.352
- I WAS NOT JEALOUS, OKAY?

09:45.385 --> 09:47.788
I WASN'T. I JUST--YOU KNOW,
LOOK, IT JUST SO HAPPENS

09:47.821 --> 09:50.724
THAT GARY AND I TEND TO DO
SOME OF OUR BEST WORK

09:50.758 --> 09:52.793
BETWEEN THE HOURS

09:52.826 --> 09:53.661
MM-HMM, MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.096
- I THINK YOU NEED
TO JUST ADMIT IT.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.765
YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP.

09:57.798 --> 09:58.932
- I'M--
- OH, MY GOD!

09:58.966 --> 10:00.167
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
I GET IT.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.902
HE'S CUTE.
- YOU THINK HE'S CUTE?

10:01.935 --> 10:02.936
- OH, YEAH.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.638
- WE'RE NOT, THOUGH.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.406
WE'RE JUST LIKE A COUPLE OF, UH,
YOU KNOW,

10:06.439 --> 10:09.242
BOOTY-CALL BUDS THAT ENJOY
EATING CHICKEN WINGS

10:09.276 --> 10:10.343
IN THE BATHTUB.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.680
- DID YOU JUST WRITE
A COUNTRY SONG?

10:12.713 --> 10:13.814
- YES, I DID,
AND IT'S CALLED

10:13.847 --> 10:15.816
WE'RE NOT IN A RELATIONSHIP.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.720

10:19.753 --> 10:22.022

- NO, I MEAN,
LOOK AT ALL THE HAPPY COUPLES.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.160
- NAH, I THINK
THAT MOST OF THESE PEOPLE

10:27.194 --> 10:29.262
ARE PROSTITUTES
WITH THEIR JOHNS.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.031
- REALLY?
- YEAH, THIS GUY?

10:31.064 --> 10:33.801
BET HE PAID A PRETTY PENNY
FOR HER.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.136
OOH, TRULY IS THE OLDEST
PROFESSION IN THE WORLD.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.738

10:44.344 --> 10:45.679
I'M A JUDGE.
HE'S BARELY A DOCTOR.

10:45.713 --> 10:46.714
HEAD SHRINK.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.682
- WE HAVE YOU DOWN
FOR THE ANNIVERSARY PACKAGE.

10:48.716 --> 10:49.683
IS THAT RIGHT?

10:49.717 --> 10:50.684
- WHAT?
- MM-HMM.

10:50.718 --> 10:51.819
- OTHERWISE, YOU CAN'T HAVE

10:51.852 --> 10:53.053
THE FREE CHAMPAGNE
AND STRAWBERRIES.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.788
- TEN YEARS TODAY.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.724
- AH, YEAH, IT'S REBECCA.

11:01.094 --> 11:01.294

11:01.328 --> 11:02.129
- HEY, YOU BARELY TOUCHED
YOUR STEAK.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.331
MY HALIBUT WAS AWESOME.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.834
- THIS PLACE IS JUST COUPLES,
COUPLES, COUPLES.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.468
IT'S LIKE NOAH'S FRICKING ARK
IN HERE.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.203
I MEAN, WE'D BE HARD PRESSED
TO FIND A THREE-TOP

11:10.237 --> 11:11.805
IN THIS RESTAURANT.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.206
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, YEAH.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.844
I'M JUST BLINDED
BY A SEA OF DIAMOND SOLITAIRES.

11:16.877 --> 11:17.711
WHAT'S THAT?

11:17.745 --> 11:18.578
- WELL,
WHILE YOU WERE IN THE BATHROOM,

11:18.611 --> 11:20.480
I ORDERED YOU
ANOTHER GIN AND TONIC.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.150
- WHY WOULD YOU ASSUME
I WANT ANOTHER GIN AND TONIC?

11:23.183 --> 11:25.152
- W--BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL
IN THE SINGLE DIGITS.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.854
- YEAH, BUT MAYBE I WANT
SOMETHING ELSE, YOU KNOW?

11:26.887 --> 11:28.188
YOU EVER THINK OF THAT?
MAYBE I WANT, I DON'T KNOW,

11:28.221 --> 11:30.257
A MARGARITA OR A GLASS OF WINE
OR A BOURBON.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.492
MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO BE
TIED DOWN TO ONE DRINK

11:32.525 --> 11:35.462
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.330
- FOR DESSERT,
YOUR SAMPLER PLATTER FOR TWO.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.966
BON APPETIT.
- AH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.267
WAIT, WAIT.
DID YOU ORDER THIS?

11:40.300 --> 11:41.234
- WELL, NO,
IT'S PART OF OUR PACKAGE.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.236
- AH, YEAH, NO, NO.
WE DON'T SHARE DESSERT.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.172
WE'RE NOT THERE YET. OKAY?
SO...

11:45.205 --> 11:46.473
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
GIVE IT TO ME.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.108
I'LL TAKE IT.
YEAH, THIS IS MINE.

11:48.141 --> 11:51.078
MINE, THIS IS MINE, SO YOU
SHOULD ORDER YOUR OWN DESSERT

11:51.111 --> 11:53.146
AS A SEPARATE PERSON.

11:53.180 --> 11:53.947
- OKAY, I HAVE AN IDEA.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.082
HOW ABOUT
WE GET THE CHECK, OKAY?

11:55.115 --> 11:58.118
WE GO UP TO THE ROOM,
TEST OUT THAT BED. WHAT'S UP?

11:58.151 --> 12:00.788
- OR, UM, HEAR ME OUT.
WILD PITCH.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.290
UM, I GO UPSTAIRS,
GET MY OWN ROOM,

12:03.323 --> 12:05.292
AND THEN WE SEE WHERE THE NIGHT
TAKES US

12:05.325 --> 12:08.161
AS SEPARATE HUMANS
ON THE PLANET.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.430
- HMM. I'M NOT SURE
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.299
- I FEEL SICK.
REALLY, I'M CRAMPING UP.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.401
I THINK I MIGHT NEED
A DOCTOR HERE.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.435
- I'M A DOCTOR.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.170
- NO, I MEAN LIKE A REAL DOCTOR.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.305
- YEAH, I'M A REAL DOCTOR.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.273
- NO, I MEAN, LIKE SOMEONE
WHO WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL

12:20.307 --> 12:22.009
AND CAN PRESCRIBE MEDICATION.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.010
- YEAH, STILL ME.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.778
- [sighs] GARY.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.546
YOU'RE, LIKE, SUFFOCATING ME.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:26.579 --> 12:28.415
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO ASK
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:28.448 --> 12:29.649
GARY, I MEAN, WHAT--

12:29.682 --> 12:33.987
STOP TAKING THE TEMPERATURE
OF OUR NOT-RELATIONSHIP, OKAY?

12:34.021 --> 12:35.188
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN,

12:35.222 --> 12:39.159
AND SUDDENLY, IT'S GETTING
ALL WEIRD AND HEAVY, YOU KNOW?

12:39.192 --> 12:41.528
IT'S LIKE THAT WEIRD FINALE
IN M.A.S.H

12:41.561 --> 12:46.233
WHERE HAWKEYE MAKES THAT LADY
KILL THE CHICKEN.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.801
YEAH.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.136
IT WASN'T A CHICKEN, GARY.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.538
IT WAS A BABY.

12:51.571 --> 12:54.441
OH, GET UP.
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.348
- OH, TEDWARD.
- YEAH, JUDGE, HEY--

13:01.381 --> 13:04.484
OH, SIR, HEY--
IS--IS THAT YOU?

13:04.517 --> 13:06.486
- I FOLLOWED YOUR ADVICE,
AND I DO BELIEVE

13:06.519 --> 13:08.555
I AM READY TO TAKE THIS PICTURE.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.224
- UH, WELL,
I SEE YOU IN THE SHIRT.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.260
I SEE YOU IN THE SHIRT,
LOOKS GOOD.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.494
DID YOU--DID YOU DO
SOMETHING ELSE?

13:14.527 --> 13:17.230
- NO, NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. THE
CLOTHES DO MAKE ME LOOK YOUNGER.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.431
- MM-HMM.
- HEY, TEDWARD.

13:18.465 --> 13:21.368
GOOD AFTERNOON,
JUDGE HERNAND--HEY!

13:21.401 --> 13:24.171
WHY?
- D--UH--

13:24.204 --> 13:27.374
JUDGE HERNANDEZ IS GETTING READY
FOR HIS NEW PORTRAIT.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.542
- OKAY, YEAH.
- HI, TEDWARD. HI, TOM.

13:29.576 --> 13:30.978
- HELLO, JUDY.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.079
- WHOA, JUDGE.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.981
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU.
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:34.014 --> 13:35.448
DID YOU TRIP
AND FALL ON A SHARPIE?

13:35.482 --> 13:39.086
- JUDY. NO.
- [sighs] SHE'S RIGHT.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.353
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.956
I CAN'T DO THIS PICTURE
LIKE THIS.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.091
- I MEAN, COME ON, JUDGE.

13:44.124 --> 13:45.358
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
A GREAT PHOTO, OKAY?

13:45.392 --> 13:49.296
- YES, AND YOUR LEGACY IS VERY
IMPORTANT TO THIS COURTHOUSE.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.331
- MM-HMM.
- SO JUST GIVE US THAT LOOK

13:51.364 --> 13:54.267
OF AUTHORITY YOU PROJECT
FROM THE BENCH.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.103
GO!

13:56.136 --> 13:57.537
JUST GO!
- I'M DOING IT!

13:57.570 --> 13:58.571
- YUP, THERE IT IS!
- UH-HUH.

13:58.605 --> 13:59.506
- YEAH, THAT'S IT.
- UH-HUH.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.241
- THAT WAS IT. I SAW IT.
- OH, HEY, JUDGE.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.242
DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE OF THAT?

14:02.275 --> 14:04.311
I WANNA DYE ALL MY CATS
THE SAME COLOR AND SEE

14:04.344 --> 14:07.347
IF I CAN STILL TELL THEM APART
BY THEIR PERSONALITY.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.349
- THIS IS ABSURD.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.318
- THAT COULD BE FUN.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.354
- THELMA AND LOUISE RIDE AGAIN!
WHOO!

14:14.387 --> 14:16.223
- I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GONNA RIDE EVER AGAIN.

14:16.256 --> 14:19.159
- OH, NO, TELL ME
THEY DID NOT GO TO JAIL.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.360
- THEY DO NOT GO TO JAIL.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.896
- SWEET!
- MM.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.132
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH--
WE'VE BEEN HERE AN HOUR,

14:25.165 --> 14:27.134
AND YOU'RE ONLY HALFWAY
THROUGH YOUR FIRST DRINK.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.636
OKAY, OKAY, WHAT HAPPENED AT
THE CRESTWICK WITH YOU AND GARY?

14:29.669 --> 14:31.204
- [sighs]

14:31.238 --> 14:32.405
I LEFT.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.207
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
I CAN SEE GARY ANYMORE.

14:34.241 --> 14:35.976
- WHY?

14:36.009 --> 14:37.610
- BECAUSE I THINK HE WANTS
TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP,

14:37.644 --> 14:39.512
AND I JUST WANNA HAVE FUN.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.315
YOU KNOW, HE STARTS HAVING
FEELINGS, I HAVE FEELINGS.

14:42.349 --> 14:45.252
FEELINGS SICKEN ME.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.020
- WELL, WHAT DID HE SAY?

14:47.054 --> 14:49.222
- WELL, HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
TO ME, OKAY?

14:49.256 --> 14:50.557
WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.259
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY I DON'T WANNA
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

14:52.292 --> 14:54.394
BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO DO
THINGS LIKE HAVE DISCUSSIONS

14:54.427 --> 14:56.930
ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP--
IT'S LIKE A VICIOUS CYCLE.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.199
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
YOU HAVE GOT TO TALK TO HIM,

14:59.232 --> 15:01.634
SO YOU CAN FIND OUT IF YOU GUYS
EVEN WANT DIFFERENT THINGS...

15:01.668 --> 15:02.635
- SAME THINGS.
- SAME THINGS.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.271
- EH.
- I KNOW YOU LIKE HIM.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.138
- YEAH, YOU DO.
- YEAH, YOU DO,

15:05.172 --> 15:07.140
BECAUSE YOU DITCHED ME AT A CLUB
FOR HIM

15:07.174 --> 15:09.276
WHILE I HAD AN OPEN TAB.
- YEAH.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.410
- YOU HAD AN OPEN TAB?

15:10.443 --> 15:12.312
- CAPTAIN KAHLUA COST ME
A FORTUNE.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.214
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
WHAT CAN I SAY?

15:14.247 --> 15:16.516
THIS BLACK AMERICAN
LOVES WHITE RUSSIANS.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.051
[chuckles]

15:21.688 --> 15:22.089
.

15:22.122 --> 15:22.990
- HEY, JUDGE.
YOU'RE UP IN A FEW MINUTES.

15:23.957 --> 15:26.593
- I WAS HOPING
YOU WOULDN'T FIND ME IN HERE.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.228
- COME ON, JUDGE.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.297
WHY DON'T YOU WANNA TAKE
THIS PICTURE?

15:30.330 --> 15:33.033
- BECAUSE THAT GUY ON THAT WALL
IS YOUNG,

15:33.066 --> 15:35.302
AND THIS GUY IS OLD.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.570
AND I HATE KNOWING THAT
THE NEXT PICTURE THEY'RE GOING

15:37.604 --> 15:40.007
TO TAKE OF ME IS THE ONE
THEY'LL USE WHEN I RETIRE,

15:40.040 --> 15:41.641
THE PICTURE THEY'LL USE
WHEN I DIE.

15:41.674 --> 15:42.709
- I MEAN, NO OFFENSE, JUDGE,

15:42.742 --> 15:45.012
BUT THE PICTURE THAT YOU HAVE
UP THERE RIGHT NOW

15:45.045 --> 15:46.479
LOOKS LIKE A DUDE WHO DIED
WHEN HE FOUND OUT

15:46.513 --> 15:49.649
HIS VHS MOVIE COLLECTION
WAS WORTHLESS.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.318
- IT IS?
[sighs]

15:51.351 --> 15:53.320
I THOUGHT IT WOULD COME BACK
LIKE VINYL.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.089
- NO, BUT THE POINT IS,
YOU LOOK GREAT.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.757
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.260
HERE.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.762
YOU LOOK LIKE A JUDGE
THAT DEMANDS THE BEST

16:02.795 --> 16:06.299
FROM EVERYBODY THAT WALKS
THROUGH THOSE DOORS,

16:06.333 --> 16:10.103
SOMEBODY WHO LETS EVERYONE KNOW
THAT THEY DESERVE JUSTICE.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.374
- LET'S TAKE A PHOTO.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.709
- YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

16:16.743 --> 16:19.479
OH, ONE LAST THING.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.381
LOSE THAT TIE, MAN.
THAT AIN'T YOU.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.716
YOU GOTTA ROCK THAT BOLO.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.718
- TEDWARD,

16:25.752 --> 16:27.320
I NEVER STOPPED ROCKING
THE BOLO.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.322
- I SEE YOU.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.191
THIS BOLO,
IT'S ALL UNDER THE TIE.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.794
- OKAY, IF THIS ROOM FULL
OF PEOPLE CANNOT COMMUNICATE

16:34.827 --> 16:36.663
WITH MR. LIN, I'M GOING TO HAVE
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.666
SO WILL YOU PLEASE ASK MR. LIN

16:39.699 --> 16:41.534
WHAT HE'S DOING
IN FRONT OF THAT STORE?

16:41.568 --> 16:45.238
- [speaking Mandarin]

16:45.272 --> 16:47.340
- POINT, POINT, POINT.
SOUND IT OUT.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.142
RUNNING MAN.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.286
- HE'S TRYING TO START
A SHOESHINE BUSINESS,

16:59.319 --> 17:01.354
BUT PEOPLE THINK HE'S HOMELESS.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.555
WHEN THEY GIVE HIM MONEY,

17:02.589 --> 17:04.424
HE THINKS THEY WANT
THEIR SHOES SHINED,

17:04.457 --> 17:06.059
SO HE TRIES TO GRAB THEIR SHOES.

17:06.093 --> 17:09.796
- AND THEY THINK THAT
HE'S TRYING TO STEAL FROM THEM,

17:09.829 --> 17:12.799
WHEN IN ACTUALITY, HE'S TRYING
TO PROVIDE THEM WITH A SERVICE.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.634
- IT'S STILL LOITERING,
YOUR HONOR.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.670
HE IS IMPEDING THE ABILITY
OF SALADICTATORSHIP

17:17.704 --> 17:21.108
TO DO BUSINESS BY SCARING AWAY
THE CUSTOMERS.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.343
EVEN MORE SO THAN THEIR NAME
ALREADY DOES.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.246
- HE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS DOING
ANYTHING WRONG.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.847
- WELL, THE STATE WILL CONSIDER
A DISMISSAL,

17:27.880 --> 17:29.816
BUT HE STILL HAS TO PAY
THE FINE.

17:29.849 --> 17:32.352
- MR. LIN--WHAT'S HAPPENING
OVER HERE WITH MR. LIN?

17:32.385 --> 17:35.722
- HE SAID THIS MAN HAS THE
GENITALIA OF A SMALL CHICKEN.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.424
- [laughs]
OH, A CHICKEN PENIS!

17:37.457 --> 17:38.625
SO TINY.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.460
- TOM, NOT ONLY AM I NOT GOING
TO FINE HIM,

17:40.493 --> 17:42.429
BUT WE'RE GOING TO HELP
MR. LIN OUT--THAT'S RIGHT.

17:42.462 --> 17:45.098
WE'RE GONNA PASS THE HAT, AND
WE'RE GONNA RAISE SOME MONEY

17:45.132 --> 17:48.701
TO GET MR. LIN A PERMIT
AND A SIGN.

17:48.735 --> 17:49.702
YEAH, I WILL START.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.771
I'VE GOT A FEW PAIRS OF SHOES
IN MY CHAMBERS.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.806
TELL HIM TO SET UP AT THE TOWER
ON SEPULVEDA.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.209
HE'LL GET GOOD TRAFFIC THERE.
YEAH?

17:56.243 --> 17:57.410
CASE DISMISSED.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.316
- OH, CHICKEN PENIS.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:03.350 --> 18:05.852
IT IS A PLEASURE
TO WATCH YOU WORK.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.654
- THANK YOU, SIR.

18:07.687 --> 18:08.821
EVERYONE DESERVES TO BE HEARD,

18:08.855 --> 18:11.458
EVEN IF IT DOES TAKE ABOUT
EIGHT PEOPLE TO GET IT DONE.

18:11.491 --> 18:14.361
- MM-HMM,
EVERYBODY EXCEPT GARY.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.862
OH! DROPS MIC!

18:15.895 --> 18:17.130
[imitating crowd roar]

18:17.164 --> 18:20.400
- TEDWARD, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I
TOLD YOU NOT TO DROP THE MIC?

18:20.433 --> 18:21.834
- [sighs]

18:21.868 --> 18:24.171
- PICK IT UP.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.140
THANK YOU.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.808
AND TURN IT OFF, PLEASE.

18:28.841 --> 18:31.844
- [groans]

18:31.878 --> 18:33.713
- HEY.

18:33.746 --> 18:36.349
- HEY, GARY,
THANKS FOR COMING BY.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.150
- YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.585
I WAS JUST
TESTIFYING DOWN THE HALL

18:38.618 --> 18:39.786
FOR A GUY WHO DRY-HUMPED
A BUNCH OF MAILBOXES.

18:39.819 --> 18:40.853
- MM.
- I GOTTA SAY,

18:40.887 --> 18:43.790
I UNDERSTAND HIS BEHAVIOR
MORE THAN I DO YOURS.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.692
- I KNOW. I KNOW.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.328
I'M SORRY, GARY.
I JUST STARTED--I DON'T KNOW.

18:48.361 --> 18:53.300
I-I STARTED TO FEEL LIKE
A CAT IN A CAGE, YOU KNOW?

18:53.333 --> 18:55.935
IT'S LIKE--IT'S LIKE
I'M AN EXOTIC TIGER, RIGHT?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.804
LIKE A BENGAL TIGER, RIGHT?

18:57.837 --> 18:59.906
AND I NEED TO ROAM IN THE JUNGLE
AND BE FREE.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.808
BUT I FELT LIKE YOU WERE
LIKE A POACHER, RIGHT?

19:01.841 --> 19:03.643
AND YOU WERE JUST COMING IN,
LIKE, ALL BOOM!

19:03.676 --> 19:05.578
AND TAKE MY TAIL
AND MAKE SOME KIND OF MEDICINE

19:05.612 --> 19:07.247
OR--OR WORSE,
LIKE, A KEYCHAIN.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.749
YOU CAN'T USE MY TAIL
AS A KEYCHAIN, GARY!

19:09.782 --> 19:11.618
- OH, UH, WOW.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.720
- YEAH. YEAH, WOW.
YOU SEE?

19:13.753 --> 19:17.724
LIKE, I GOTTA BE--I GOTTA, LIKE,
GO--MM--OUT OF THE CAGE.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.760
RIGHT? I WANNA BE ROAMING
IN THAT TALL GRASS.

19:20.793 --> 19:21.628
I WANNA SEE SOMETHING.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.829
I WANNA TAKE IT DOWN.
I WANNA HUNT.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.932
I WANNA BE FREE AND, LIKE,
HAVE FUN AND SUN MYSELF AND--

19:25.965 --> 19:28.968
- OKAY, OKAY,
I FEEL LIKE WHATEVER WE HAVE,

19:29.001 --> 19:31.271
YOU ARE THIS CLOSE
TO BAILING ON IT,

19:31.304 --> 19:34.807
SO THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO DO.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.843
- WHOA, WHOA, GARY,
DID YOU NOT JUST UNDERSTAND

19:36.876 --> 19:37.910
THIS WHOLE CAT STORY?

19:37.944 --> 19:40.347
- REBECCA--
WHAT'S YOUR MIDDLE NAME?

19:40.380 --> 19:41.714
- GARY--
- OKAY.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.883
REBECCA GARY WRIGHT,

19:43.916 --> 19:46.319
WILL YOU NEVER, EVER MARRY ME?

19:46.353 --> 19:47.320
- WHAT?

19:47.354 --> 19:49.822
- I WANNA WAKE UP IN THE MORNING
IN AN EMPTY BED

19:49.856 --> 19:51.358
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY GONE.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.960
WHEN YOU'RE SICK,
I WANT TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

19:53.993 --> 19:54.994
ANYWHERE ELSE.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.796
AND WHEN WE ARE 75,

19:56.829 --> 19:59.732
I WANNA LOOK ACROSS THE TABLE
AND SEE A 25-YEAR-OLD.

19:59.766 --> 20:00.733
I WANT THE SAME FOR YOU TOO.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.770
REBECCA, I'M NOT THINKING
ABOUT THE FUTURE,

20:03.803 --> 20:05.772
BUT YOU ARE COOL,
AND YOU'RE HOT.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.707
AND DAMN, GIRL,
YOU MAD FLEXIBLE.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.742
[both laugh]

20:09.776 --> 20:11.978
- OH, GIRL.
- GIRL.

20:12.011 --> 20:16.616
- GARY, MAN, YOU--

20:16.649 --> 20:17.684
YOU'RE GOOD.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.718
- GOOD.

20:18.751 --> 20:19.719
- YOU GOT A DEAL.

20:19.752 --> 20:20.820
- LET'S JUST HAVE FUN.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.722
- I LOVE IT.
- OKAY. I LOVE IT.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.925
- [chuckles]

20:25.958 --> 20:27.694
- I MEAN I LOVE IT, NOT YOU.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.729
- NO, NO, I GET IT.
- OKAY.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.968
TO NEVER KNOWING EACH OTHER.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.805
- MM.

20:38.838 --> 20:39.939
- WHOO!
- NICE.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.975
- WHOO! AH! I WANT ANOTHER SHOT.
YOU WANT ANOTHER SHOT?

20:43.009 --> 20:45.745
- OH, YEAH, LET'S GO HALFSIES,
THOUGH--CLEANER THAT WAY.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.281
- AW, GARY.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.949
- GARY!
- WHAT'S UP, TEDWARD?

20:49.982 --> 20:52.419
- SEEMS LIKE YOU TWO
ARE BACK ON TRACK.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.487
- 100% COMMITTED
TO NONCOMMITMENT.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.523
WHICH IS PERFECT, YOU KNOW,
'CAUSE IT'S WHAT WE BOTH WANT.

20:56.556 --> 20:57.924
- YEAH. YEAH.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.759
LOOK AT REBECCA MAKING OUT
WITH THAT DUDE AT THE BAR.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.895
- WHAT?
- AH! AHA!

21:02.929 --> 21:03.996
- TEDWARD, ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.832
- NO, I WAS NOT FINISHED YET.

21:05.865 --> 21:06.866
AHA!

21:06.899 --> 21:08.501
- [chuckles]
