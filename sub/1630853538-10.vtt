to my hallway.

my bedroom door closed,

06:18.465 --> 06:21.337

I wouldn't have heard it.

on the other side.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.588
Um, why don't I ask them

06:54.631 --> 06:56.111
if they heard something
that night?

06:56.154 --> 06:57.895
Right, uh, anything else?

07:01.333 --> 07:03.945
Blood came out of our faucet.

07:05.207 --> 07:07.252
-When was this?
-A month ago.

07:07.296 --> 07:09.167

-No.

making noises.

you saw demons?

07:16.218 --> 07:19.351
No. The kids did,
but we never saw anything.

07:31.712 --> 07:33.540

07:33.583 --> 07:37.282
I had blood come up
from my toilet.

07:37.326 --> 07:39.894
-And Ben helped me with it.
-What the hell?

07:39.937 --> 07:43.375
Yeah, it's an old house.
I just thought, um...

07:44.855 --> 07:46.509
I don't know what I thought.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.032
And I never told you this.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.121
But when I was fixing
your toilet,

07:50.165 --> 07:52.472
an eyeball came up
from the drain.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.256
KRISTEN:
And you didn't tell me?

07:54.299 --> 07:55.692
I thought it would
freak you out.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.041
Of course it would freak me out!

07:57.085 --> 07:59.870

from the house next door?

07:59.914 --> 08:01.263

08:01.306 --> 08:03.787
There's a shared sewer line.

08:03.831 --> 08:06.181
So is it from theirs
or from yours?

08:06.224 --> 08:08.139
I don't know.

08:08.183 --> 08:10.011
I-I'm not hearing
any growls or groans

08:10.054 --> 08:12.056
from-from the wall
that she's talking about.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.797

with the Mons--

08:20.238 --> 08:22.589
I'll check in
with Father Ignatius.

08:22.632 --> 08:25.243

at another family's house today.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.991

I mean "the four of you."

to your dad in about 30 minutes,

No, no, no, I want to talk
about something else.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.922
Mom, I had nothing
to do with it, okay?

09:34.965 --> 09:36.924
No, no, no, no, no,
that's not it.

09:36.967 --> 09:40.144
Um, you met the new people
next door, right?

09:40.188 --> 09:41.885

-Yeah.

09:41.929 --> 09:44.061
Right, they said they met you.
Um...

to scare them?

09:49.197 --> 09:50.851
-What?
-Do you girls

09:50.894 --> 09:52.809
go to the wall,
and-and make sounds there?

09:52.853 --> 09:54.724
-Why would we do that?
-I don't know.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.160

It used to scare Laura,
but now she just...

-All you.
-Come.

Oh, thanks.

47:45.688 --> 47:47.908
There is this man

47:47.952 --> 47:49.867
who is late for a meeting,

47:49.910 --> 47:52.782
a meeting
that will change his life.

47:52.826 --> 47:55.176
-Is this a parable?
-Yes.

47:55.220 --> 47:57.613
But not Shakespeare?

47:57.657 --> 47:59.354
No, it's not Shakespeare.

48:00.355 --> 48:02.401
Anyway, this man,

48:02.444 --> 48:04.533
who is heading
toward this important meeting,

48:04.577 --> 48:06.796
couldn't find a parking space.

48:06.840 --> 48:09.538
He went up and down the block,

48:09.582 --> 48:12.933
but every space was taken, and
it's getting later and later.

48:12.977 --> 48:16.458
So, finally, he prays to God.

48:17.851 --> 48:19.679
"God, please

48:19.722 --> 48:21.942
"help me find a space,

48:21.986 --> 48:24.075
"and I promise

48:24.118 --> 48:26.164

I'll stop cheating on my wife.

48:29.471 --> 48:32.648
I'll commit myself to you."

48:32.692 --> 48:35.086
And at that moment,

48:35.129 --> 48:37.958
he sees a car
pulling out of a space,

48:38.002 --> 48:40.874
and he tells God...

48:40.918 --> 48:43.877
"Never mind, I found a space."

48:47.098 --> 48:50.057
And you think
that's what I'm doing?

48:50.101 --> 48:52.712

revealing himself.
