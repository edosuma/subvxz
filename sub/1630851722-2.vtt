PHIL KEOGHAN:
Previously on Tough As Nails,

00:06.406 --> 00:10.310
-12 hardworking Americans...
-They call me "Eliza-beast."

00:10.310 --> 00:12.312
...tough from
their everyday lives...

00:12.312 --> 00:13.747
I'm a commercial superintendent.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.749
I'm the old guy here, I'm 55.

00:15.749 --> 00:18.084
Call me "Captain Kalimba."
I've been through the storm,

00:18.084 --> 00:19.519
and I've survived,
and I keep on going.

00:19.519 --> 00:22.155
...reported to
Camp Pendleton in California...

00:22.155 --> 00:25.091
-Welcome toTough As Nails.
-(contestants cheer)

00:25.091 --> 00:28.361
...where they immediately
dropped into their first job.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.163
-Let's get it done!
-(work whistle blows)

00:30.163 --> 00:31.598
KEOGHAN:
They are going for it.

00:31.598 --> 00:34.501
Lineman Mike
and Jill-of-all-trades Lia

00:34.501 --> 00:36.403
raced across the line first...

00:36.403 --> 00:39.873
There goes Lia!
She beats Mike by half a wheel.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.408
Mike comes in second.

00:41.408 --> 00:44.244
...earning the right
to pick teams.

00:44.244 --> 00:46.846
I pick Dirty Hands.
We're gonna get the job done.

00:46.846 --> 00:48.848
As another chapter
for Dirty Hands

00:48.848 --> 00:51.518
and Savage Crew began,
the newly formed teams

00:51.518 --> 00:53.586
were tested in
their first team challenge...

00:53.586 --> 00:54.888
(work whistle blows)

00:54.888 --> 00:56.256
...building
a military staging area.

00:56.256 --> 00:57.724
Get the wire laid out.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.560
Dirty Hands picked
Jill-of-all-trades Lia

01:00.560 --> 01:03.163
to be crew boss,
but it was Savage Crew...

01:03.163 --> 01:04.564
SARAH:
Talk to me, Alfie, you good?

01:04.564 --> 01:06.900
...led by cement mason Sarah...

01:06.900 --> 01:08.334
-Sarah's crew with the win!
-(cheering)

01:08.334 --> 01:10.236
...that won
the first Badge of Honor.

01:10.236 --> 01:13.506
Being a veteran, I wanted
to make my battle buddies proud.

01:13.506 --> 01:15.375
-Tonight...
-Go, go, go, go, go!

01:15.375 --> 01:17.410
ELIZABETH:
Get your stuff set.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.646
...with Savage Crew up one-zero
in the team competition...

01:19.646 --> 01:21.581
CHRISTINE:
Let's go! Move with a purpose!

01:21.581 --> 01:24.317
-...can Dirty Hands tie
the score?
-LIA: I gotta be up there.

01:24.317 --> 01:25.485
KALIMBA: This needs to be
where the yellow is.

01:25.485 --> 01:28.221
Or will Savage Crew stay on top?

01:28.221 --> 01:31.558
In the individual competition,
these rugged competitors

01:31.558 --> 01:33.993
will punch in
for the chance of a lifetime.

01:33.993 --> 01:37.163
Tonight, one of them will
also punch out,

01:37.163 --> 01:41.034
losing their shot
at the $200,000 prize

01:41.034 --> 01:43.403
and an all-new Ford Super Duty.
-Oh...

01:43.403 --> 01:46.206
This isTough As Nails.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.909
♪ ♪

02:07.994 --> 02:09.896
♪ ♪

02:27.046 --> 02:28.715
♪I'm tough as nails. ♪

02:35.522 --> 02:38.091
-I feel so pumped up
from yesterday.
-I do, too.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.926
Just how well
we worked together,

02:39.926 --> 02:41.394
-communicated together.
-Yeah. Teamwork.

02:41.394 --> 02:43.863
We're not scared to communicate.

02:43.863 --> 02:45.098
Today is
our second team challenge,

02:45.098 --> 02:46.599
and we're up one to zero.

02:46.599 --> 02:48.401
Savage Crew is feeling like

02:48.401 --> 02:49.702
we're unstoppable.

02:49.702 --> 02:51.170
HANGER:
Gettin' higher in elevation,

02:51.170 --> 02:53.239
we have to pace ourselves, guys.

02:53.239 --> 02:54.841
ALFIE:
Yes, my ears are popping.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.509
You will get dizzy,

02:56.509 --> 02:58.444
so when we stop,
take real big, deep, breaths.

02:58.444 --> 03:00.013
-KELSY: Stay hydrated.
-Get your body used to this.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.986
CHRISTINE: I've been up
parts of Mt. Baldy.

03:06.986 --> 03:08.821
I'm not from California,
but I moved here

03:08.821 --> 03:10.557
two and a half years ago now.

03:10.557 --> 03:12.458
-What about you, Quincey?
-I'm from South Carolina,
you know--

03:12.458 --> 03:15.495
country, small little town,
only one stoplight.

03:15.495 --> 03:18.965
-The town I live in
doesn't have a stoplight.
-(laughter)

03:18.965 --> 03:20.900
JEROME:
Where I live, too,
in a little city, like,

03:20.900 --> 03:22.702
on the same street.
That's-that's my family.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.371
We kinda grew up poor, but rich,
like, we loved it.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.141
That's how we raised--
the beach, just a walk away.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.842
So that was our playground.

03:29.842 --> 03:31.377
Everything is family.

03:31.377 --> 03:34.581
I been married to my wife,
uh, 22 years,

03:34.581 --> 03:36.482
but been with her 28 years.

03:36.482 --> 03:38.518
You know how much
this money can do for

03:38.518 --> 03:40.587
each and every one of us
over there?

03:40.587 --> 03:42.589
Hawaii is really expensive,

03:42.589 --> 03:44.757
and paycheck to paycheck,
I mean, everybody.

03:44.757 --> 03:47.694
Money's food on my kids' table.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.429
Well, I worked construction
from before high school

03:49.429 --> 03:52.031
with my dad, and then earned
my way up to this,

03:52.031 --> 03:53.366
being an operator.

03:53.366 --> 03:54.767
I'm the one
digging the trenches.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.336
Basically any machine
on the job site,

03:56.336 --> 03:57.704
I basically can

03:57.704 --> 03:59.906
almost run every one.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.483
-MIKE: Yeah.
-HARPER: Look at this, man.

04:10.483 --> 04:11.818
-JEROME: Wow.
-CHRISTINE: Beautiful sky.

04:11.818 --> 04:13.286
ALFIE:
Look at that view!

04:13.286 --> 04:15.722
-Top of the world.
-Good morning, Phil!

04:15.722 --> 04:16.689
KEOGHAN: Good morning,
everybody.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.157
Welcome to Mount Baldy.

04:18.157 --> 04:20.126
You've literally gone
from sea level

04:20.126 --> 04:21.828
to the highest point
in L.A. County.

04:21.828 --> 04:24.530
Any idea why
they call it "Ol' Baldy?"

04:24.530 --> 04:27.467
-No, tell us.
-It's bald! Come on, guys.

04:27.467 --> 04:28.735
(laughter)

04:28.735 --> 04:30.503
Quincey,
I know you know that.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.405
Absolutely, uh-huh.
No trees up here, definitely.

04:32.405 --> 04:34.474
-KEOGHAN:
It's bald of all trees.
-(chuckles)

04:34.474 --> 04:36.509
During the ski season,

04:36.509 --> 04:38.845
this place is completely covered
with snow.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.546
KELSY:
Wow.

04:40.546 --> 04:42.048
KEOGHAN: It's all about
snowboarding and skiing,

04:42.048 --> 04:43.883
but then in the off season,

04:43.883 --> 04:45.551
-that's when
all the hard work begins.
-ELIZABETH: Yeah.

04:45.551 --> 04:49.055
Because chairlifts get broken,
equipment gets broken,

04:49.055 --> 04:51.190
-stuff has to get fixed.
-Yeah.

04:51.190 --> 04:54.060
The job takes place
down by the ski lift.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.428
-Let's go.
-Let's do this.
-Let's go!

04:55.428 --> 04:56.429
Let's do it!

04:57.697 --> 04:59.666
KEOGHAN:
Watch your step.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.938
(siren wails)

05:05.938 --> 05:08.675
-Holy cow!
-They're coming in hot.

05:10.309 --> 05:11.944
(siren whoops)

05:14.013 --> 05:17.183
KEOGHAN: Tommy and Lars,
a couple of legends up here.

05:17.183 --> 05:19.686
They call them the "Baldy Boys."

05:19.686 --> 05:22.021
-Yeah, Baldy Bad Boys.
-The Baldy Bad Boys.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.957
KEOGHAN: Somebody's gotta do
the hard work around here,

05:24.957 --> 05:27.160
and that's up to these guys.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.028
You're gonna see what
all that hard work is about

05:29.028 --> 05:32.899
in today's job by fixing
six ski lift chairs

05:32.899 --> 05:34.467
so they're ready
for next season.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.335
When the work whistle blows,
you'll start the job by

05:36.335 --> 05:39.639
removing all the old wooden
slats from six chairs,

05:39.639 --> 05:41.240
and then
replacing them with new ones.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.509
You'll see that
each chair has four small,

05:43.509 --> 05:46.746
ten medium, and then,
one large slat along the back.

05:46.746 --> 05:49.048
Then you got to get them
up on the cable.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.551
Now, there's hundreds
of chairs on these chair lifts.

05:51.551 --> 05:52.919
These guys are thankful
that you're gonna

05:52.919 --> 05:55.321
-at least be doing six of them.
-(laughter)

05:55.321 --> 05:57.056
First team
to get the job done is

05:57.056 --> 06:00.993
-going to win $12,000...
-(cheering)

06:00.993 --> 06:03.596
...and today's Badge of Honor.

06:03.596 --> 06:07.834
And don't forget, the team
with the most wins overall

06:07.834 --> 06:09.335
will get a cash bonus prize

06:09.335 --> 06:12.371
of $60,000.

06:12.371 --> 06:14.941
-Yeah!
-Nice.

06:14.941 --> 06:16.776
KEOGHAN:
All right, take a moment,

06:16.776 --> 06:18.778
figure out
who's gonna be the crew boss.

06:18.778 --> 06:20.012
QUINCEY:
This definitely would be

06:20.012 --> 06:21.948
a very, very detailed,
uh, job, so...

06:21.948 --> 06:23.883
-Kinda assembly line
kinda thing, maybe?
-Yeah. Yeah.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.551
-KALIMBA: Christine should
do it, right?
-Absolutely.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.320
She pay
good attention to detail.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.689
Yeah, if you guys want me,
I'll do it.

06:29.689 --> 06:32.492
So we chose Christine
to be our crew boss today.

06:32.492 --> 06:35.061
The way that she
explained to us on the last

06:35.061 --> 06:38.064
team challenge
how to put up the tent,

06:38.064 --> 06:39.699
she paid attention to detail.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.167
-We need to flip it up.
-TAK: Okay.

06:41.167 --> 06:44.137
Pull out, as tight as you can.
Tight!

06:44.137 --> 06:46.339
And the tent went up...
flying colors.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.808
We need to be calm
and we need to be focused.

06:48.808 --> 06:49.909
We cannot miss
anything in the beginning.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.644
We should do an assembly line.

06:51.644 --> 06:53.412
We need to check if
that wood needs to be prepped.

06:53.412 --> 06:55.081
We can have
some people prepping wood,

06:55.081 --> 06:56.382
we can have
some people removing them.

06:56.382 --> 06:57.717
Who wants to be crew boss?

06:57.717 --> 07:00.019
-I like Elizabeth.
-Okay, I'll do it.

07:00.019 --> 07:03.022
I like the assembly line idea,
though, when, if, we...

07:03.022 --> 07:05.091
Don't-don't rule that out.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.693
Elizabeth runs
her own company, so

07:07.693 --> 07:09.195
now we know that
there is organization.

07:09.195 --> 07:11.664
That there's strength
and leadership.

07:11.664 --> 07:14.467
And so we're comfortable
with Elizabeth

07:14.467 --> 07:15.468
taking it at the helm.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.542
KEOGHAN:
$12,000 on the line,
and today's Badge of Honor.

07:22.542 --> 07:23.776
On the work whistle!

07:25.011 --> 07:26.712
(work whistle blows)

07:26.712 --> 07:29.315
ELIZABETH:
Get your stuff set.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.184
Sarah, Kelsy,
I want you to grab hammers.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.618
JEROME:
Okay, hammer.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.886
TAK:
I'll help you drill.

07:33.886 --> 07:36.656
KEOGHAN: Dirty Hands off
to a smashing start.

07:36.656 --> 07:39.358
First part of the job,
removing those old slats.

07:39.358 --> 07:42.495
Sarah and Kelsy, use your
hammer. Let me show you.

07:42.495 --> 07:44.030
You can prop it up
with your foot...

07:44.030 --> 07:45.031
-Yep. Yep.
-To get these back ones.

07:45.031 --> 07:47.567
-Full strength. Okay?
-Got it. Got it.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.735
As a general contractor,
I like to line my guys out,

07:49.735 --> 07:53.472
I like to have everything
they need set in front of them

07:53.472 --> 07:54.807
so that we can work efficiently

07:54.807 --> 07:56.042
and get everything done.

07:56.042 --> 07:58.344
Okay, Alfie,
I want you and Hanger

07:58.344 --> 08:01.814
to preset everything
you'll need behind each chair.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.784
I need people on bolt cutters.

08:04.784 --> 08:08.254
CHRISTINE:
With my experience
in production welding,

08:08.254 --> 08:10.356
I don't want
to focus on one chair.

08:10.356 --> 08:12.491
I want everybody doing
their own task, and everybody

08:12.491 --> 08:14.293
helping each other
if they need it.

08:15.628 --> 08:18.664
Listen, I want you to
hold it so he can drill.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.800
I want you to drill straight.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.936
I decide to have two teams
building, so we would

08:23.936 --> 08:26.339
just leapfrog each other
and move down the line.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.642
And then set them up
as we finish each one.

08:29.642 --> 08:33.012
-Bring it to 'em?
-Yeah, bring, uh,
bring the hardware.

08:33.012 --> 08:35.715
As a fire captain,
I use my skills

08:35.715 --> 08:37.283
of organization in

08:37.283 --> 08:38.451
setting up
each of the stations with

08:38.451 --> 08:40.453
the proper supplies
that they needed.

08:40.453 --> 08:44.056
KEOGHAN:
Being organized is crucial
to finishing this job first.

08:44.056 --> 08:45.825
You got three
different size slats

08:45.825 --> 08:48.027
and 15 slats on each chair.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.963
That's 90 slats that
you've gotta keep track of.

08:50.963 --> 08:53.232
Hard to tell
exactly who's ahead,

08:53.232 --> 08:55.134
but look at Savage Crew,
steadily working away.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.637
They're working
right on top of each other.

08:57.637 --> 09:00.139
-How's our timing?
-You guys are fine,
you're doing good.

09:00.139 --> 09:01.807
You're gonna
get faster as you go.

09:01.807 --> 09:02.842
I don't want you
to worry about time.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.745
KEOGHAN:
Elizabeth laying down the law

09:05.745 --> 09:07.613
to her Savage Crew teammates,

09:07.613 --> 09:09.615
while Dirty Hands is
in a very spirited mood,

09:09.615 --> 09:11.117
having fun on the job.

09:11.117 --> 09:13.152
-"Yessah!"
-(laughing)

09:13.152 --> 09:14.921
"Blessah."

09:14.921 --> 09:18.257
"Yessah," is like "yes, sir,"

09:18.257 --> 09:20.793
and then "blessah"
is like you're blessed.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.161
So, "Yes, sir, I'm blessed."

09:22.161 --> 09:23.529
-You need the back one now?
-"Yessah."

09:23.529 --> 09:25.865
-"Yessah."
-TAK: It's just a saying we say

09:25.865 --> 09:28.167
when we're having a good time or

09:28.167 --> 09:29.835
if I catch a good fish,
or a good wave.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.637
"Yessah!" I'm stoked about it.

09:31.637 --> 09:33.606
-"Yessah, blessah."
-CHRSTINE: Looking good, guys.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.107
Fast drilling,
do two at a time.

09:35.107 --> 09:36.442
-We need a small one.
-That's a small one.

09:36.442 --> 09:37.777
-Need small one.
-Need small.

09:37.777 --> 09:38.844
SARAH:
We're kinda struggling with

09:38.844 --> 09:40.179
keeping the boards in order,

09:40.179 --> 09:41.614
as far as the smaller pieces

09:41.614 --> 09:43.115
to the medium pieces.

09:43.115 --> 09:45.484
We need to pay attention
to detail because

09:45.484 --> 09:47.653
that's something
that can cost us more time.

09:47.653 --> 09:50.122
-How's it look?
-Yeah, we're good.

09:50.122 --> 09:53.359
KEOGHAN:
Tommy's signing off on
Savage Crew's first chair.

09:53.359 --> 09:55.661
That chair weighs over 150
pounds; he just picked it up

09:55.661 --> 09:57.330
like it was nothing.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.900
He's gotta those hooks perfectly
between the two pieces of tape

10:00.900 --> 10:02.568
so the chairs are
evenly spaced on the cable.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.870
Securing the clamps.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.405
Now finishing off

10:06.405 --> 10:08.074
the first chair
with a torque wrench.

10:08.074 --> 10:09.709
He's got to get it tightened up

10:09.709 --> 10:11.744
so that it's got
38 foot-pounds.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.512
-Head to a click.
-All right, chair's good.

10:13.512 --> 10:14.814
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew with their first

10:14.814 --> 10:16.082
chair up on the chair lift.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.384
We've got
the thumbs-up from Tommy.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.653
That's the first of six
they need to complete.

10:20.653 --> 10:23.589
Dirty Hands, spread out
across all six chairs.

10:23.589 --> 10:25.825
They want to get
all the chairs complete

10:25.825 --> 10:27.093
before they start thinking

10:27.093 --> 10:28.828
about putting them up
on the chair lift.

10:28.828 --> 10:32.064
Why don't we skip, so we're
not working next to each other?

10:32.064 --> 10:34.100
-Can we do that, Alfie? Okay.
-OTHERS: No. No.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.701
-ELIZABETH: We'll leapfrog.
-HARPER: Okay.

10:35.701 --> 10:38.037
Elizabeth had a good point,
that she wanted to

10:38.037 --> 10:40.172
get that first chair up
as fast possible.

10:40.172 --> 10:42.708
And then we moved
from two to three

10:42.708 --> 10:44.443
as quickly as possible.

10:44.443 --> 10:46.112
MIKE: Number two,
number two going up. Heads up.

10:46.112 --> 10:49.048
Hey. Come on, guys,
move with a purpose. Let's go!

10:49.048 --> 10:50.616
QUINCEY:
Let's work, let's work,
people, let's work.

10:50.616 --> 10:51.617
KALIMBA:
Dirty Hands is a little nervous.

10:51.617 --> 10:52.618
We need to tie the score.

10:52.618 --> 10:54.420
We need to make it one-one.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.522
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

10:56.522 --> 10:58.124
Instead of yelling,
"let's go," let's just

10:58.124 --> 10:59.558
-yell what we need to do.
-Okay, okay.

10:59.558 --> 11:02.228
Keeping a situation calm is
very important in my job.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.497
People's lives are in danger.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.165
Christine, do you want--
Just wait, wait, wait.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.967
Everybody quiet. Christine,
what would you like us to do?

11:07.967 --> 11:10.636
-Let's get this one done,
and then we'll start hanging.
-Okay.

11:10.636 --> 11:13.205
If somebody's talking
for no reason on a radio,

11:13.205 --> 11:15.207
you're not gonna hear that some
other firefighter needs help,

11:15.207 --> 11:16.976
and they-they could die.

11:16.976 --> 11:18.344
All clear here, ready to go.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.979
KEOGHAN:
Thumbs-up from Tommy.

11:19.979 --> 11:22.915
Savage Crew,
two chairs ahead of Dirty Hands.

11:22.915 --> 11:25.418
Looks like Elizabeth's
method is paying off.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.854
Finally, Dirty Hands gettin'
up their first chair, now.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.490
Lars watchin' on, making
sure the job is done right.

11:31.490 --> 11:32.725
-Click.
-Click.

11:32.725 --> 11:35.227
Let's go, Dirty Hands!

11:35.227 --> 11:36.862
KEOGHAN: That is complete.
Lookin' for a thumbs-up.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.731
-Lars, how's that?
-Yeah, they're good.

11:38.731 --> 11:42.368
Dirty Hands get their
first chair up, five to go.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.036
Lift is clear.

11:44.036 --> 11:48.074
Savage Crew gettin' another
chair up, chair number three.

11:48.074 --> 11:51.677
They have a solid lead,
two chairs ahead of Dirty Hands.

11:52.945 --> 11:54.847
Here comes the second chair
for Dirty Hands.

11:54.847 --> 11:57.750
They're picking up momentum,
but is it too late?

11:57.750 --> 11:59.452
-The ladder comes on this side.
-Yeah.
-You're good.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.453
QUINCEY: You need me
to move it some more?

12:00.453 --> 12:02.054
No, it has to go on this side.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.056
I got to be right
where the yellow is.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.991
-I know, but we have to
hang this.
-Move it back, move it back.

12:05.991 --> 12:07.493
-You need to move--
-I gotta be up there.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.295
I gotta be up--
Trust me, I'll lean.

12:09.295 --> 12:10.963
This needs to be where
the yellow is, correct?

12:10.963 --> 12:13.499
-I understand.
-Look up.
Look where the ladder is.

12:13.499 --> 12:15.301
-I apologize.
We're moving, moving.
-Thank you. All right.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.136
LIA:
Christine is our crew boss,

12:17.136 --> 12:20.172
but Kalimba is making sure
we stay on task,

12:20.172 --> 12:22.174
and keeping everyone calm

12:22.174 --> 12:23.409
to keep everything moving.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.910
QUINCEY:
Go, go, go, go, go!

12:24.910 --> 12:27.646
Chair number two is up
for Dirty Hands.

12:27.646 --> 12:30.249
Savage Crew,
still all bunched together.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.419
MIKE:
You know, I finish up
with the third one, you know?

12:33.419 --> 12:36.689
And then I see
we're not done, and I'm like,

12:36.689 --> 12:38.424
"Let's keep it up. What
do you need? What do you need?"

12:38.424 --> 12:40.493
-Did you get these tight?
-Yep, yep, yep. Just that one.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.428
That's chair number three

12:42.428 --> 12:44.363
-getting put on for Dirty Hands.
-Go, go, go, go, go, go!

12:44.363 --> 12:47.533
Number four is lined up.
Five is close to go.

12:47.533 --> 12:50.102
And six is being worked on
by Quincey and Jerome.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.837
-Good, Lars?
-Yep, yep.

12:51.837 --> 12:54.607
-Lars, we got a thumbs-up?
-Third chair is good.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.610
Dirty Hands have their
third chair up on the cable.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.579
They've tied the score with
Savage Crew. What a comeback!

13:00.579 --> 13:04.517
-Go, go, go, go, go.
-We're not stopping.

13:04.517 --> 13:05.851
HANGER: Don't give up, guys.
I... don't worry about...

13:05.851 --> 13:07.052
-KELSY: Nobody is. Come on.
-MIKE: Yes.

13:07.052 --> 13:08.721
-Nope, we're not.
-HANGER: Don't worry.

13:13.259 --> 13:16.595
KEOGHAN: We are 30 minutes
into this job, everybody.

13:16.595 --> 13:18.330
Both teams with three

13:18.330 --> 13:20.299
refurbished chairs on the cable.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.935
It's gonna take six
to get the job done.

13:22.935 --> 13:25.237
Chair number four now,

13:25.237 --> 13:26.605
-going up for Dirty Hands.
-We really gotta move back.

13:26.605 --> 13:29.308
Here we go, Savage Crew
now moving chair number four.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.278
We're ready for number five
in about 30 seconds.

13:32.278 --> 13:33.445
-We'll be ready.
We'll be ready.
-KALIMBA: Okay.

13:33.445 --> 13:36.282
KEOGHAN:
Mike attaching chair
number four.

13:36.282 --> 13:37.583
Wow, look at this.

13:37.583 --> 13:40.252
Dirty Hands lining up
chair number five.

13:40.252 --> 13:42.988
Jerome and Quincey
working on chair number six.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.691
Mike coming down from
the ladder, he's tired.

13:45.691 --> 13:47.693
-He's been lifting
those chairs all by himself.
-All right, good.

13:47.693 --> 13:49.195
-Here, here.
-Go, go.
Yep, yep, yep, let's go.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.663
ELIZABETH: We ran into
some problems, you know?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.532
Some of the boards that we
had preset kinda got mixed up.

13:53.532 --> 13:55.534
All right, get this one up.
Let's get this one up and ready.

13:55.534 --> 13:58.637
Chair five
complete for Dirty Hands.

13:58.637 --> 14:00.973
Alfie jumping in to help
Mike with Savage Crew's

14:00.973 --> 14:03.642
fifth chair,
but no match for Dirty Hands.

14:03.642 --> 14:07.613
The entire team, working
on their sixth and final chair.

14:07.613 --> 14:11.417
That decision to assembly line,
really paying off.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.485
They're beating
Savage Crew at their own game.

14:13.485 --> 14:15.254
JEROME: Yeah, sorry.
Just toughen up.

14:15.254 --> 14:16.922
-All right.
-Yessah!

14:16.922 --> 14:19.658
KEOGHAN:
Here we go, last chair going up
for Savage Crew.

14:19.658 --> 14:21.660
-Yeah, that's tight. We're good.
-We're good.

14:21.660 --> 14:23.662
KEOGHAN:
Alfie now up on the ladder.

14:23.662 --> 14:24.830
We're good. Let's go.

14:24.830 --> 14:27.900
Looking for a thumbs-up
from Lars.

14:27.900 --> 14:31.136
Dirty Hands with the win!
They get the job done!

14:31.136 --> 14:33.405
-(whooping)
-Yessah!

14:33.405 --> 14:34.673
Yeah!

14:34.673 --> 14:36.075
Yeah.

14:36.075 --> 14:39.511
-Hey, everybody in.
-(laughter)

14:39.511 --> 14:42.748
LIA:
This team was thrown
together in less than 24 hours.

14:42.748 --> 14:44.650
We lost a challenge,

14:44.650 --> 14:48.621
so to be back to ground zero
again-- we're-we're even--

14:48.621 --> 14:49.655
is so satisfying.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.957
Whoa, drinks.

14:51.957 --> 14:54.526
SARAH:
An assembly line would
have been a better strategy

14:54.526 --> 14:56.929
because that's what
got us our first success.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.931
And I think
our biggest downfall was,

14:58.931 --> 15:01.967
we came in a little cocky,
and we weren't humble,

15:01.967 --> 15:03.902
we weren't respecting
that the other team

15:03.902 --> 15:05.904
was just as hungry as us.

15:05.904 --> 15:07.973
Attention to detail, I think
we were kinda lacking on that.

15:07.973 --> 15:10.576
Yes. She had everything set up.
We messed it up.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.944
ELIZABETH: You guys were
my lead carpenters.

15:11.944 --> 15:13.412
I asked you
to preset everything,

15:13.412 --> 15:15.080
but there was
too many materials there.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.949
HANGER:
When you're yelling at me

15:16.949 --> 15:18.817
and saying I'm doing
something wrong,

15:18.817 --> 15:20.419
that doesn't help Savage Crew,

15:20.419 --> 15:22.488
and I shut down.

15:22.488 --> 15:25.624
As a commercial superintendent,
you can't go back

15:25.624 --> 15:26.792
and say, "Oh, the framer,

15:26.792 --> 15:28.560
"he didn't level that
just right,

15:28.560 --> 15:29.595
so the wall came out
a little crooked."

15:29.595 --> 15:30.896
It's your fault.

15:30.896 --> 15:32.331
That's what you get paid for.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.900
Savage Crew,
yesterday was your day,

15:34.900 --> 15:37.569
-but today,
Dirty Hands brought it.
-Yeah!

15:37.569 --> 15:39.305
-Great job, Dirty Hands.
-Good job, guys.

15:39.305 --> 15:40.639
-Yeah!
-Thank you, guys.

15:40.639 --> 15:41.507
What I saw today was
incredible leadership

15:41.507 --> 15:42.975
from you, Christine.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.443
-Thank you.
-Cool, calm, collected.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.912
And Kalimba,
awesome team support.

15:46.912 --> 15:49.281
Your calmness really had
an impact on the team, too.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.984
I'm super proud of these guys.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.352
Christine,
I want to award you

15:53.352 --> 15:55.120
today's Badge of Honor,

15:55.120 --> 15:57.756
-and $12,000 for your team.
-Oh.
-(whoops)

15:57.756 --> 16:00.326
$2,000 each.

16:00.326 --> 16:01.860
You gotta be
absolutely tough to do this job.

16:01.860 --> 16:04.029
And they gotta worry
about people being up on those.

16:04.029 --> 16:07.032
-Kids and family...
-Moms, dads, grandparents.

16:07.032 --> 16:08.367
And I really appreciate
y'all guys for what y'all do.

16:08.367 --> 16:09.568
-KEOGHAN: That's nice.
-QUINCEY: Thank y'all.

16:09.568 --> 16:11.203
Well said, Quincey, beautiful.

16:11.203 --> 16:13.272
-The score is one apiece.
-Yes!

16:13.272 --> 16:16.241
Things are heatin' up,
but tomorrow is the start

16:16.241 --> 16:18.644
of the individual competition.

16:18.644 --> 16:22.548
12 of the best of the best,
from all over America

16:22.548 --> 16:24.216
go head-to-head,
and by the end of the day,

16:24.216 --> 16:27.252
one of you will be eliminated
from the individual competition.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.891
All right, everybody,
see you tomorrow.

16:32.891 --> 16:34.259
-(excited chatter)
-Good job, bro.

16:34.259 --> 16:36.161
SARAH:
It's definitely gonna be

16:36.161 --> 16:37.563
an adjustment,
trying to get out

16:37.563 --> 16:38.964
of being a team member

16:38.964 --> 16:41.133
and playing for yourself.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.434
But I think it will be
good for everybody

16:42.434 --> 16:43.836
to be able to have
their own time

16:43.836 --> 16:45.804
to show their own strengths.

16:48.807 --> 16:51.410
-QUINCEY: Great job, everybody.
-We needed this today.

16:51.410 --> 16:53.345
It feels so good to win.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.314
It brings up our confidence.

16:55.314 --> 16:56.515
KALIMBA: I think it was
really important that

16:56.515 --> 16:58.951
now we've evened out
the score, 1-1.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.819
Kalimba's our anchor, for sure.

17:00.819 --> 17:04.390
She's a calm,
cool and collected woman.

17:04.390 --> 17:07.092
I think experience with
being in hectic situations

17:07.092 --> 17:08.894
probably comes from, like,
emergencies.

17:08.894 --> 17:11.964
I work in Minneapolis,
in the 3rd district.

17:11.964 --> 17:15.434
But, so, you were directly
involved with the protests

17:15.434 --> 17:18.103
of George Floyd-- you were
there in the mix of it?

17:18.103 --> 17:20.072
Yes. It happened, like,
eight blocks from my station.

17:20.072 --> 17:21.740
So, some of my best friends,

17:21.740 --> 17:23.242
they went and did CPR
in the ambulance.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.444
-Oh, no.
-Oh, wow.

17:25.444 --> 17:26.745
KALIMBA:
So then, by 3:00,

17:26.745 --> 17:28.547
the whole city just
changed, like that.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.883
And I had to keep calm.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.419
Like, I don't know how many
fires we had; hundreds of fires.

17:33.419 --> 17:36.255
-Dang.
-Everywhere was just burning.

17:36.255 --> 17:38.090
I was driving my son to school,

17:38.090 --> 17:41.293
and you could see the city
burning from 15 miles away.

17:41.293 --> 17:43.662
He looks at me and says, "Mom,
remember, you're just a mom.

17:43.662 --> 17:45.664
You're not a hero."

17:45.664 --> 17:47.399
And I was, like, how do I go and

17:47.399 --> 17:50.002
protect my city,
and have to protect my son?

17:50.002 --> 17:51.170
And how do you feel
as a Black man?

17:51.170 --> 17:52.738
Do you feel like
you always have to

17:52.738 --> 17:54.773
hold yourself to a higher
standard when you go around...

17:54.773 --> 17:56.108
It bothers me a lot, you know.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.009
That's why-- I was kinda back
here kinda quiet

17:57.009 --> 17:58.777
-when you talking about it.
-Yeah.

17:58.777 --> 18:00.179
QUINCEY: I could've been one
of those people, you know?

18:00.179 --> 18:01.914
I can't cut nobody off,
blow the horn.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.615
There ain't no telling,
road rage people, I mean...

18:03.615 --> 18:06.018
It always feels like, that
you have a target on your back.

18:06.018 --> 18:07.686
-Right. You know what I mean?
-Wow.

18:07.686 --> 18:09.288
That's so sad, man.

18:09.288 --> 18:10.122
JEROME: Like for us,
how me and Tak grew up,

18:10.122 --> 18:11.790
like, we saw interracial--

18:11.790 --> 18:13.725
That's why I never knew, like,
what you was talking about.

18:13.725 --> 18:15.861
Like, cause,
I-- I-- we love everybody.

18:15.861 --> 18:17.896
-Yeah.
-KALIMBA: I do believe
people are inherently good.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.965
I've seen people come together

18:19.965 --> 18:22.267
and have conversations
that they never had before.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.803
And so, I don't live in fear,
I live in hope.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.051
HANGER:
Yesterday, I felt

18:39.051 --> 18:40.786
-I let you guys down.
-Oh, no.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.489
Never.
They won because

18:43.489 --> 18:45.123
they were able
to assemble themselves

18:45.123 --> 18:47.626
and get organized
a little bit better than us.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.228
-Okay, that's fair.
-Okay, fair.

18:49.228 --> 18:51.997
Now we're talking as a team.

18:51.997 --> 18:54.266
First individual
competition today.

18:54.266 --> 18:55.467
-HANGER: Individual?
-ALFIE: Flippin' the switch.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.669
But it's gonna be
an odd feeling, you know?

18:57.669 --> 18:58.937
MIKE:
In a sense, it's--

18:58.937 --> 19:01.573
You're competing against
your other family.

19:01.573 --> 19:03.675
-HANGER: Wow.
-MIKE: But then, I'm competing

19:03.675 --> 19:05.244
for my family.

19:05.244 --> 19:06.678
-Right. Exactly.
-You know what I mean?

19:06.678 --> 19:09.781
Being a lineman,
it's very hard on my kids.

19:09.781 --> 19:13.752
I've struggled through coming
home after work and sitting down

19:13.752 --> 19:15.420
to a dinner with
the family and then getting

19:15.420 --> 19:16.855
a phone call saying,

19:16.855 --> 19:18.557
"Hey, we got an emergency,
we got lines down."

19:18.557 --> 19:20.893
And you gotta go.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.394
And that-that's the worst
feeling. Especially...

19:22.394 --> 19:23.729
(sighs)

19:25.731 --> 19:28.133
Especially when, uh,
my son comes up to me

19:28.133 --> 19:29.801
and hugs my leg,

19:29.801 --> 19:31.703
and that's
the last thing I-I hold,

19:31.703 --> 19:34.907
and then I'm back to work again.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.408
That's hard.

19:36.408 --> 19:39.478
I want this so badly
for my family. I mean,

19:39.478 --> 19:40.913
it's all for them.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.249
KELSY:
Wow, look at this hill.

19:44.249 --> 19:46.118
I mean, look at
the clouds down there.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.720
Once you touch a cloud,
your life is never the same.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.390
It's a magical world up there.

19:51.390 --> 19:54.092
First time I was ever flying

19:54.092 --> 19:55.427
in a helicopter, by myself,

19:55.427 --> 19:57.563
it was a moment
where I was like,

19:57.563 --> 19:59.831
"I can do anything."

19:59.831 --> 20:01.667
My dad started the business.

20:01.667 --> 20:05.837
He grabbed me 'cause I was
the oldest of five sisters.

20:05.837 --> 20:07.272
He has taken me under his wing.

20:07.272 --> 20:08.840
He's so proud of me today,
and what I'm doing.

20:12.411 --> 20:14.246
JEROME:
Beautiful.

20:14.246 --> 20:15.647
LIA:
Let's get to work.

20:15.647 --> 20:18.750
-We're up even higher today.
-Oh, yeah.

20:18.750 --> 20:22.988
Today is the start of
the individual competition.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.457
As you know, there will be

20:25.457 --> 20:27.793
only one
Tough As Nails champion.

20:27.793 --> 20:30.963
Only one of you
is going to win that

20:30.963 --> 20:33.465
beautiful 2022 Ford Super Duty,

20:33.465 --> 20:36.168
$200,000...

20:36.168 --> 20:38.370
-(whooping)
-...not to mention the belt.

20:38.370 --> 20:39.671
You want to get
one of those belts,

20:39.671 --> 20:41.640
just like Murph's.
You ever go to a bar,

20:41.640 --> 20:43.976
you walk in with that,
who's gonna mess with you?

20:43.976 --> 20:46.144
-I won't have no problems.
-(laughter)

20:46.144 --> 20:48.947
You're gonna punch in today,

20:48.947 --> 20:51.483
and if you touch that timecard
again, that means you have

20:51.483 --> 20:54.186
punched out of the individual
competition, and that's it.

20:54.186 --> 20:55.821
You've lost
your shot at that title.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.556
You only want to do this once.

20:57.556 --> 20:58.957
Mike, lead us off.

21:09.568 --> 21:11.069
Good luck, everybody.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.609
Last time I see you.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.244
(laughter)

21:25.684 --> 21:28.320
Being an ironworker
is definitely badass.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.756
You know, we're considered
the "cowboys of the sky."

21:30.756 --> 21:32.524
or in my case, "the cowgirl."

21:32.524 --> 21:35.527
Our union has
over 5,000 members;

21:35.527 --> 21:37.462
about 100 of us are women.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.531
When I first get on
the job site, I get the looks

21:39.531 --> 21:40.532
and the stares.

21:40.532 --> 21:42.100
"Oh, there's a chick here."

21:43.335 --> 21:45.504
Self-confidence has
definitely been an issue.

21:45.504 --> 21:48.140
I never felt like I was
pretty enough, skinny enough.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.108
I want to do this
for people that are

21:50.108 --> 21:52.344
kinda struggling
within themselves

21:52.344 --> 21:55.781
because of their gender
or their sexuality.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.649
Irongirl is here
to bring the heat.

21:57.649 --> 22:00.552
I want to show that you can be
whoever you want to be.

22:00.552 --> 22:02.854
It's that battle within
yourself you need to conquer.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.729
-Time to get to the money.
-(laughter)

22:10.729 --> 22:12.497
KEOGHAN:
So now everybody's punched in.

22:12.497 --> 22:14.266
Are you ready
to get your first job done?

22:14.266 --> 22:16.134
-Yeah!
-Oh, yes!

22:16.134 --> 22:17.402
Any idea why
there are fences built

22:17.402 --> 22:19.638
-so high up on the mountain?
-The snow.

22:19.638 --> 22:21.006
-Snow. And wind.
-KEOGHAN: A lot of snow..

22:21.006 --> 22:23.742
An avalanche can go
over 150 miles an hour.

22:23.742 --> 22:25.844
If an avalanche comes
through here, the fences

22:25.844 --> 22:27.279
slow the avalanche down.

22:27.279 --> 22:29.614
And after a harsh winter,
and all that heavy snow

22:29.614 --> 22:31.450
sitting on top of
these fences, you can see

22:31.450 --> 22:32.818
they need to be replaced.

22:32.818 --> 22:36.021
Your job today is
to fix a section of fence.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.656
-Wow.
-All the wood you need

22:37.656 --> 22:40.258
to get the job done
is laid out in front of you.

22:40.258 --> 22:43.161
The 4X6 posts need to go
into the ground two feet,

22:43.161 --> 22:44.996
so that the painted part
of the post disappears.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.766
And you've got five
2X6 planks that you need

22:47.766 --> 22:50.035
to nail into those posts.

22:50.035 --> 22:53.004
I hope you're good with
a hammer, because each plank

22:53.004 --> 22:56.441
needs to be secured
in place with six nails.

22:56.441 --> 22:59.177
The tools you need to get
the job done are laid out here.

22:59.177 --> 23:02.481
Your two most valuable
tools today,

23:02.481 --> 23:05.317
when you're digging,
an ice cream scoop...

23:05.317 --> 23:07.719
-Ice cream scoop?
-And a tuna can.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.755
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23:14.459 --> 23:17.295
Your job today
is to build a fence.

23:17.295 --> 23:19.164
And you'll be relying
heavily on your two

23:19.164 --> 23:21.767
most valuable tools:

23:21.767 --> 23:25.337
an ice cream scoop
and a tuna can.

23:25.337 --> 23:26.171
-You gotta be kidding me.
-Wow.

23:26.171 --> 23:27.839
Now, this is not a joke.

23:27.839 --> 23:29.307
You try and get
an auger out here

23:29.307 --> 23:31.276
to dig a hole,
it's just not gonna work.

23:31.276 --> 23:34.112
These two tools are
going to be essential to

23:34.112 --> 23:36.948
removing the rocks
and dirt from your hole.

23:36.948 --> 23:39.751
Your final task is
you gotta cut up the old posts,

23:39.751 --> 23:42.587
using a saw,
and put them into these barrels.

23:42.587 --> 23:45.757
You'll be doing this
in two heats of six.

23:45.757 --> 23:48.627
The last person to finish
in each heat will be

23:48.627 --> 23:50.362
going into overtime,
and by the end of the day,

23:50.362 --> 23:52.964
one of you will be punching out.

23:52.964 --> 23:55.700
If you win today's job,
you are going to be getting

23:55.700 --> 23:59.104
electric tools
worth over $1,000.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.539
(contestants exclaiming)

24:00.539 --> 24:02.174
And just to make sure that
the job is done right,

24:02.174 --> 24:04.409
-guess who's here. Tommy!
-How you guys doing?

24:04.409 --> 24:07.145
-(cheers and applause)
-Heat one up first.

24:07.145 --> 24:09.981
After a random draw,
we've got Mike, Kelsy,

24:09.981 --> 24:13.051
Jerome, Elizabeth, Quincey, Tak.

24:13.051 --> 24:14.953
Heat two, you'll be watchin'.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.788
-Tommy, make sure
they do a good job.
-CHRISTINE: Good luck, guys.

24:20.792 --> 24:23.728
Give it everything you've got.
On the work whistle.

24:25.263 --> 24:26.398
(work whistle blows)

24:31.803 --> 24:34.506
Tak has got
the tuna can workin' away.

24:34.506 --> 24:36.341
Look at that, he's diggin' down.

24:36.341 --> 24:38.577
Kelsy, makin' use
of the ice cream scoop.

24:38.577 --> 24:41.146
Wow, Kelsy's almost
face-planting the dirt.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.949
ELIZABETH:
From the tips of my fingers
to my armpit was two feet.

24:43.949 --> 24:45.450
So I know when I'm diggin',

24:45.450 --> 24:47.118
my head's gotta be
in that hole

24:47.118 --> 24:48.787
or I'm not deep enough.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.755
KEOGHAN:
Quincey is gettin' deep.

24:50.755 --> 24:51.590
-Whole face is covered in mud.
-Oh, my goodness me.

24:51.590 --> 24:52.791
Look at that.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.092
ALFIE:
He's, I mean, he put it all...

24:54.092 --> 24:56.261
KEOGHAN: Oh, that is
commitment, right there.

24:56.261 --> 24:58.997
QUINCEY: I'm actually
having a fun time, really,

24:58.997 --> 25:00.765
'cause I'm having flashbacks
of me diving,

25:00.765 --> 25:04.135
finding balls, or blocking
for the-- my running back.

25:04.135 --> 25:06.304
I'm swallowing dirt and dust.

25:06.304 --> 25:09.040
I'm gettin' it all in my mouth,
all in my nose, all in my ears.

25:10.275 --> 25:11.443
Come on, Kelsy.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.278
KEOGHAN:
These posts are 12 feet long.

25:13.278 --> 25:16.047
They've got to go
two feet into the ground.

25:16.047 --> 25:17.649
Oh, he's pretty close.

25:19.551 --> 25:21.920
-Yeah, that looks good.
-Kelsy gets the thumbs-up

25:21.920 --> 25:23.321
and she has her post in place.

25:23.321 --> 25:25.757
Elizabeth is looking good.

25:25.757 --> 25:28.326
-Jerome, Tak...
-Yeah, it looks good.

25:28.326 --> 25:30.595
Mike, Quincey, not far behind.

25:30.595 --> 25:34.599
Gotta get all this old wood off
to put the new planks in.

25:34.599 --> 25:36.801
-KALIMBA: Whoa!
-KEOGHAN: Whoa, he's just gonna
rip 'em off.

25:36.801 --> 25:38.503
That is sheer power!

25:38.503 --> 25:41.573
Now it's about getting
those five planks nailed on.

25:41.573 --> 25:43.808
-CHRISTINE: Go, Tak!
-LIA: Yeah, Kelsy!

25:43.808 --> 25:46.244
KEOGHAN:
Two planks at one time
from Elizabeth. Great move!

25:46.244 --> 25:48.914
JEROME:
The altitude catching you,
so your chest is grabbing.

25:48.914 --> 25:50.282
Just one nail becomes,

25:50.282 --> 25:52.284
like, the challenge
in your mind,

25:52.284 --> 25:54.853
and, oh, the forearms are
just ripped.

25:57.622 --> 25:59.090
KEOGHAN:
20 minutes in.

25:59.090 --> 26:01.359
Remember,
we're up about 9,000 feet.

26:01.359 --> 26:03.595
Less oxygen in the air up here.

26:03.595 --> 26:06.197
That's why you're
finding it hard to breathe.

26:06.197 --> 26:07.432
-Watch it!
-Ooh!

26:07.432 --> 26:08.934
Quincey, safety, safety.

26:08.934 --> 26:11.436
Kelsy's still driving in nails
on her first plank.

26:11.436 --> 26:13.872
Those six-inch nails
are no joke.

26:13.872 --> 26:16.474
KELSY:
I was doing really good;
I was keeping up my pace.

26:16.474 --> 26:18.276
It wasn't until
those massive nails

26:18.276 --> 26:20.478
that I was like, "Uh-oh."

26:21.646 --> 26:22.981
TOMMY:
Quincey's good.

26:22.981 --> 26:25.116
Just needs to cut it
in half and he's done.

26:25.116 --> 26:27.085
KEOGHAN:
Quincey, one more thing
to do here.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.387
He's gotta cut this old post
in half and get it into the bin.

26:29.387 --> 26:30.789
SARAH:
Slow and steady.

26:30.789 --> 26:33.058
KEOGHAN:
Wow, look at that saw flexing.

26:33.058 --> 26:35.427
And Jerome has his section
of fence complete.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.562
He needs to cut
his old post in half

26:37.562 --> 26:38.964
and he'll have the job done.

26:43.635 --> 26:45.937
-Whoa!
-(contestants exclaiming)

26:45.937 --> 26:47.138
KEOGHAN: Quincey just
breaks that in half.

26:47.138 --> 26:49.507
And...

26:49.507 --> 26:53.111
-Quincey takes that win!
-Yeah!

26:53.111 --> 26:54.245
I finished first in my heat,

26:54.245 --> 26:56.281
and my body, this leg,

26:56.281 --> 26:57.482
this ankle, this-- this--

26:57.482 --> 26:58.483
hadn't been through that much

26:58.483 --> 27:00.452
intensity since that time,

27:00.452 --> 27:02.320
high school, my senior year.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.955
KEOGHAN:
You might be a mechanic
but I'll tell you what,

27:03.955 --> 27:05.857
Hanger might offer you a job.

27:05.857 --> 27:07.859
Start of the redemption.

27:07.859 --> 27:09.728
It'd feel a whole
lot better with

27:09.728 --> 27:12.130
$200,000.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.699
I can have some closure then.
(chuckles)

27:14.699 --> 27:16.868
TOMMY:
That looks good.

27:16.868 --> 27:19.104
KEOGHAN:
There goes Jerome,
he gets it done.

27:19.104 --> 27:21.573
-LIA: Yeah! Good job, guys.
-Looks good, Phil.

27:21.573 --> 27:24.242
Both Elizabeth and Mike are
fighting it out for third place.

27:24.242 --> 27:26.111
Come on, guys!

27:26.111 --> 27:28.780
KEOGHAN:
Mike gets it done just
seconds before Elizabeth.

27:28.780 --> 27:31.883
We are down to two,
Kelsy and Tak.

27:31.883 --> 27:34.219
Tak, done with his fence,
moving on to

27:34.219 --> 27:35.887
saw his old post in half.

27:35.887 --> 27:37.589
Kelsey's gonna
get this job done,

27:37.589 --> 27:40.091
that last
six-inch nail going in.

27:40.091 --> 27:42.060
KELSY:
We're at high altitude,
I'm trying to breathe,

27:42.060 --> 27:45.930
and my arm felt like Jell-O,
and it wanted to stop.

27:45.930 --> 27:48.400
One of you will be
going into overtime.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.403
I was struggling
to even grip anything.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.638
KALIMBA:
Come on, Tak! You got this.

27:53.638 --> 27:56.508
I never did cut a 4X6
with a handsaw,

27:56.508 --> 27:58.343
and I was like "Whoa."

27:58.343 --> 28:00.145
And I don't want
to go into overtime,

28:00.145 --> 28:02.180
so I gotta figure
this thing out quick.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.282
HANGER:
Good job, my sister,
good job.

28:04.282 --> 28:06.918
Come on, my union brother.

28:06.918 --> 28:08.286
-There you go, Tak.
-(indistinct shouting)

28:09.287 --> 28:11.756
-LIA: All right, Tak!
-It's going in.
-Good job!

28:11.756 --> 28:13.525
KEOGHAN:
Tak gets the job done.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.126
Kelsy, heading into overtime.

28:15.126 --> 28:16.361
Yeah.

28:19.464 --> 28:22.033
The last of you to get
the job done will be going

28:22.033 --> 28:24.803
into overtime against Kelsy.

28:24.803 --> 28:26.538
On the work whistle.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.939
(work whistle blows)

28:27.939 --> 28:29.040
First up,
you gotta dig a hole,

28:29.040 --> 28:30.575
so that you can get your

28:30.575 --> 28:32.243
post two feet into the ground.

28:32.243 --> 28:33.378
KELSY:
Looking good, everyone.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.914
I'll be taking
the big rocks out.

28:35.914 --> 28:38.049
KEOGHAN:
That's 24 inches that
needs to go into the hole.

28:38.049 --> 28:41.953
Has Alfie got a deep
enough hole to get his post in?

28:41.953 --> 28:43.388
-That looks pretty good to me.
-Looks good, Phil.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.956
ELIZABETH:
All right, Alfie.

28:44.956 --> 28:47.158
KEOGHAN:
Alfie takes the lead
in this heat.

28:47.158 --> 28:49.661
Christine, full commitment
with the tuna can.

28:49.661 --> 28:52.330
Here comes Hanger.
Is his hole deep enough?

28:52.330 --> 28:55.233
-Lookin' pretty good.
And Christine.
-TOMMY: You're good.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.102
-And Kalimba.
-Yeah, you're good.

28:59.137 --> 29:01.339
LIA: Stones are coming out,
but more are going in,

29:01.339 --> 29:02.507
and, oh, my goodness.

29:02.507 --> 29:05.076
It was just like
this terrible treadmill

29:05.076 --> 29:08.213
of stones sliding. (laughs)

29:08.213 --> 29:10.181
KELSY:
Yeah, Sarah! Good job.

29:10.181 --> 29:11.549
KEOGHAN:
Sarah's got it in.

29:11.549 --> 29:14.119
Lia, the last
to get her post in.

29:14.119 --> 29:15.453
Alfie, already on
to his third plank.

29:15.453 --> 29:17.388
He's racing through this today.

29:17.388 --> 29:19.891
I know that there's
a lot of carpenters.

29:19.891 --> 29:23.361
There's Hanger.
Alfie has carpentry experience.

29:23.361 --> 29:25.964
I'm a little leery, but,
I think I can keep up with them.

29:25.964 --> 29:28.233
Oh! Oh...

29:28.233 --> 29:30.201
The hole is so far back.

29:30.201 --> 29:32.370
I put my post too far back,
so I'm fighting,

29:32.370 --> 29:33.771
like, a six-inch gap.

29:33.771 --> 29:34.973
KEOGHAN:
Gotta see if those planks will

29:34.973 --> 29:36.441
bend back towards the post.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.109
They gotta go back a long way.

29:38.109 --> 29:39.777
I think she's strong
enough to pull it over.

29:39.777 --> 29:42.147
CHISTINE:
My dad was a carpenter.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.582
He's the one that taught me
how to swing a hammer.

29:44.582 --> 29:45.817
So I want to make him
proud on this one.

29:47.585 --> 29:48.987
JEROME:
All right, Lia!

29:48.987 --> 29:51.256
-KELSY: All right, Lia!
-Lia gets her post in.

29:51.256 --> 29:54.826
Sarah and Kalimba, gettin'
the second plank in place.

29:54.826 --> 29:57.562
Christine, making it work,
she's flexin' that wood.

29:57.562 --> 30:00.331
Way to recover, Christine.
Nice.

30:00.331 --> 30:03.067
Hanger with his fourth plank,
gettin' it into place.

30:03.067 --> 30:05.170
KELSY:
Alfie, with all five!

30:05.170 --> 30:07.572
-KEOGHAN: Alfie!
-KELSY: Alfie,
you're crushing it.

30:07.572 --> 30:11.075
-This is gonna be tight.
-HANGER: Holding a hammer comes
second nature to me.

30:11.075 --> 30:14.512
It's in my bloodline,
from my grandfather to my dad.

30:14.512 --> 30:16.614
KELSY: Alfie's just got
a couple nails left.

30:16.614 --> 30:17.982
TOMMY:
Hanger's nails are good.

30:17.982 --> 30:20.084
KEOGHAN:
Hanger completes
his section of fence.

30:20.084 --> 30:22.020
He's just got to saw
his old post in half

30:22.020 --> 30:24.155
and get the job done.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.157
-But Alfie's chasing him down.
-Phil, he's good.

30:26.157 --> 30:27.759
He wants to win this heat.

30:27.759 --> 30:30.261
Somebody's going home
with $1,000 worth

30:30.261 --> 30:31.963
of power tools today.

30:31.963 --> 30:34.933
Can anybody beat Quincey's time?
That's the question.

30:34.933 --> 30:36.968
(all shouting)

30:36.968 --> 30:39.103
-Oh, my God!
-Yes! Put it in!
-Put it in...

30:43.274 --> 30:44.442
Stop the clock!

30:44.442 --> 30:47.178
Alfie, you're almost there.

30:47.178 --> 30:50.348
Good job, brother.
Good job.

30:50.348 --> 30:52.951
HANGER:
I hear my teammates saying,
"You did it,"

30:52.951 --> 30:54.152
and I get choked up.

30:54.152 --> 30:55.386
Beautiful job.

30:55.386 --> 30:57.222
Having that
love and encouragement,

30:57.222 --> 30:58.556
it felt great.

30:58.556 --> 31:01.893
-Yeah!
-Alfie gets the job done.

31:01.893 --> 31:04.162
Meanwhile,
Christine gets the thumbs-up

31:04.162 --> 31:05.830
to start sawing as well.

31:05.830 --> 31:07.465
HANGER:
Come on, Christine!

31:07.465 --> 31:10.134
KEOGHAN:
Kalimba with all five planks
in place.

31:10.134 --> 31:12.937
Now, she has to get
six nails into each of them.

31:12.937 --> 31:14.806
30 nails.

31:14.806 --> 31:16.241
KALIMBA:
Worked for the last 21 years,
under pressure.

31:16.241 --> 31:17.942
That's what I do.

31:17.942 --> 31:19.410
I want to win because,
it's for my city,

31:19.410 --> 31:20.778
for my station, for my district,

31:20.778 --> 31:23.181
for my family,
it's for my boys.

31:23.181 --> 31:26.985
KEOGHAN:
Lia, who was the last to
get her post in the ground,

31:26.985 --> 31:29.354
has raced ahead
of Sarah and Kalimba,

31:29.354 --> 31:30.755
completing her fence.
Now moving on

31:30.755 --> 31:33.825
to cut her old fence post
in half.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.660
Nice recovery.

31:35.660 --> 31:37.695
KEOGHAN:
Oh!

31:37.695 --> 31:40.031
That's the move!

31:40.031 --> 31:42.267
HANGER:
That's my union ironworker.

31:42.267 --> 31:46.537
-KEOGHAN:
Lia's broken the old post.
-Come on, Lia!

31:46.537 --> 31:49.107
-Come on, Lia!
-Way to go, Lia!

31:49.107 --> 31:50.942
-KELSY: Way to go, Lia!
-ELIZABETH: You got it!

31:50.942 --> 31:53.611
KELSY:
Way to go, Lia! Way to go!

31:53.611 --> 31:55.546
LIA:
It felt good for me
to finish this challenge.

31:55.546 --> 31:57.548
I'm self-motivated and driven

31:57.548 --> 32:00.285
because my mother was
sick with MS,

32:00.285 --> 32:03.454
and she was unable to even
scratch her nose or-or to speak.

32:03.454 --> 32:05.223
When I heard that
you were freakin' sawing,

32:05.223 --> 32:07.558
I was like,
"I gotta go into overdrive!"

32:07.558 --> 32:10.728
People I've talked to have said
that I'm just like my mother,

32:10.728 --> 32:12.297
full of energy
and full of life.

32:12.297 --> 32:15.633
And my mother's ability
to enjoy life was taken away,

32:15.633 --> 32:17.402
so, I still feel like

32:17.402 --> 32:20.071
I'm living life for both of us.

32:21.806 --> 32:23.341
35 minutes in now.

32:23.341 --> 32:26.177
Kalimba, our fire captain,

32:26.177 --> 32:28.446
up against Sarah,
our cement mason.

32:28.446 --> 32:31.949
Who will stay in overtime?
There's one spot left.

32:31.949 --> 32:33.851
-My aim is horrible.
-HANGER: Come on!

32:33.851 --> 32:35.353
Do it for the masons!

32:35.353 --> 32:37.488
-Do it for the firefighters!

32:37.488 --> 32:39.257
-Please stop.
-HANGER: Let's go!

32:39.257 --> 32:41.092
Hanger, they can't hear you
down there.

32:41.092 --> 32:42.360
CHRISTINE:
All right, Sarah!

32:42.360 --> 32:44.095
HANGER:
Let's go!

32:50.368 --> 32:53.204
KEOGHAN:
Oh, the arms are aching.

32:53.204 --> 32:55.540
Who will go into
overtime against Kelsy?

32:55.540 --> 32:57.742
I know it burns, Sarah.
Come on, sister.

32:57.742 --> 32:59.510
SARAH:
My forearms are exhausted.

32:59.510 --> 33:01.713
Just trying to find the will

33:01.713 --> 33:03.281
to keep diggin' deep,
and keep, you know,

33:03.281 --> 33:04.949
gettin' that strikes
and making 'em count.

33:04.949 --> 33:07.185
I can't even,
like, move my hand.

33:07.185 --> 33:10.288
You know, I was missing it,
and my hands were cramping.

33:10.288 --> 33:13.191
My biggest motivation is
making my mom proud,

33:13.191 --> 33:15.226
and my sons.
You know, we just

33:15.226 --> 33:16.694
put one foot in front
of the other.

33:16.694 --> 33:18.129
I learned that from my mom.

33:18.129 --> 33:19.497
That's what she's done
my whole life.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.799
How, how, how, how, how?

33:21.799 --> 33:24.202
-ALFIE: You got it, Kalimba.
-KELSY: You got it.

33:24.202 --> 33:26.337
It's not over till it's over!

33:26.337 --> 33:28.406
(contestants shouting
encouragement)

33:28.406 --> 33:30.174
-Sarah's got her fence built.
-TOMMY: Nice work, Sarah.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.343
KEOGHAN: Now she's got
to cut the old post.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.912
ELIZABETH:
Yeah, Kalimba!

33:35.880 --> 33:37.548
Keep it up, Kalimba.

33:37.548 --> 33:38.683
-You got it.
-(cheering)

33:41.819 --> 33:43.755
And Sarah gets the job done!

33:43.755 --> 33:45.723
(cheering, whooping)

33:45.723 --> 33:47.992
SARAH:
I'm thankful.

33:47.992 --> 33:49.327
It's kinda bittersweet because

33:49.327 --> 33:51.162
I've gotten some time
to talk to Kalimba,

33:51.162 --> 33:53.598
and she's here for
all the right reasons.

33:53.598 --> 33:55.099
But, at the same time,
you gotta understand

33:55.099 --> 33:56.334
that it's business,

33:56.334 --> 33:58.336
and there's a job
that has to get done.

33:58.336 --> 34:00.571
So, you gotta dig deep.

34:00.571 --> 34:02.974
Way to not give up.
I like that. That was hard.

34:02.974 --> 34:04.542
KALIMBA:
I'm not really proud of the
work I've done on this fence.

34:04.542 --> 34:06.277
-Thank you, guys.
-KELSY: You fought till the end.

34:06.277 --> 34:07.945
KALIMBA: But anything
can happen in overtime.

34:07.945 --> 34:09.547
Like, I'm strong, I work hard

34:09.547 --> 34:11.549
and I do believe
I have what it takes to do this.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.718
I said to you
that there would be a winner

34:13.718 --> 34:15.686
with the fastest time.

34:15.686 --> 34:18.523
Heat one was won by Quincey.

34:18.523 --> 34:19.891
Quincey had a time

34:19.891 --> 34:22.827
-of 23 minutes and 57 seconds.
-Oh, my God.

34:22.827 --> 34:24.962
-(whoops)
-MIKE: Yeah!

34:24.962 --> 34:26.330
-LIA: Yeah! Animal.
-TOMMY: The speed you ended up
with, man.

34:26.330 --> 34:29.667
And in heat two,
that was won by Hanger.

34:29.667 --> 34:33.371
-MIKE: Hanger...
-His time: 23 minutes...

34:36.474 --> 34:38.843
-...and 42 seconds.
-(contestants shouting)

34:38.843 --> 34:42.713
Our winner today was Hanger,
by 15 seconds.

34:42.713 --> 34:44.882
-(cheering, whooping)
-Oh, my God.
-Great job, Hanger.

34:44.882 --> 34:46.517
Wow, that's great, man.

34:46.517 --> 34:48.352
He beat me by 15 seconds.

34:48.352 --> 34:49.687
Oh, my God.

34:49.687 --> 34:51.722
QUINCEY: Hanger,
31-year veteran at it.

34:51.722 --> 34:53.591
It just goes to show
that you can't put judgement

34:53.591 --> 34:56.394
on somebody's career, you know?

34:56.394 --> 34:58.663
If people know how to work,
they know how to work.

34:58.663 --> 35:00.231
Hanger, I'm pleased to tell you

35:00.231 --> 35:01.866
you have some power tools,

35:01.866 --> 35:03.301
-as the winner today.
-Yeah!

35:03.301 --> 35:05.169
-(cheering)
-Yeah!

35:05.169 --> 35:07.104
To win
the individual challenge--

35:07.104 --> 35:09.307
-that means a lot to me.
-Oh, my God.

35:09.307 --> 35:11.843
I would work
side by side with my father,

35:11.843 --> 35:14.812
and that inspired me
to be a carpenter.

35:14.812 --> 35:16.781
In school, I struggled;

35:16.781 --> 35:19.150
as a child, I was depressed.

35:19.150 --> 35:21.853
Thank God
that I had a loving family

35:21.853 --> 35:24.055
that, when I came home,

35:24.055 --> 35:26.057
they were always there
to pick me up.

35:26.057 --> 35:27.959
Who said you old, Hanger?

35:27.959 --> 35:29.494
Who said you was old?

35:29.494 --> 35:32.730
HANGER: So I have
dedicated my life to help

35:32.730 --> 35:35.967
anybody that's struggling
with hard times.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.535
I want to make a difference.

35:37.535 --> 35:39.804
I don't want to come
to the end of my life

35:39.804 --> 35:41.639
and have any regrets.

35:41.639 --> 35:44.742
In heat one, Kelsy,
you were the last to finish.

35:44.742 --> 35:46.077
You will be going into overtime.

35:46.077 --> 35:47.979
Kalimba,
you were the last to finish,

35:47.979 --> 35:49.480
you will be going into overtime.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.350
And by the end of the day,
one of you will be punching out.

35:52.350 --> 35:54.852
-KALMIBA: All right.
-Overtime. Are you ready?

35:54.852 --> 35:56.020
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
-Let's do it.

35:58.856 --> 36:00.558
♪ ♪

36:02.693 --> 36:04.495
KALMIBA:
Walking into overtime,

36:04.495 --> 36:06.163
there's a lot on the line.

36:06.163 --> 36:07.665
We have a family motto
that says,

36:07.665 --> 36:09.467
"Don't let anybody outwork you."

36:09.467 --> 36:12.370
If you're the hardest worker in
the room, you'll get somewhere.

36:12.370 --> 36:13.671
-(clapping)
-All right!

36:13.671 --> 36:14.972
People underestimate me

36:14.972 --> 36:16.307
and they shouldn't.

36:16.307 --> 36:17.308
I give props to my dad

36:17.308 --> 36:18.809
for giving me that confidence.

36:18.809 --> 36:20.111
It is overtime.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.145
-Yeah.
-My dad took me

36:21.145 --> 36:22.146
to all the business meetings.

36:22.146 --> 36:23.881
There would be a table of 20 men

36:23.881 --> 36:25.983
and he'd be in my ear,

36:25.983 --> 36:27.118
"Don't let that scare you."

36:27.118 --> 36:29.353
I will not be
the first to punch out.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.856
When these snow-making machines
are operating

36:31.856 --> 36:34.659
in optimum conditions,
it pumps out enough snow

36:34.659 --> 36:37.662
to cover an area
the size of a football field

36:37.662 --> 36:39.497
with six inches of snow

36:39.497 --> 36:41.532
in just 24 hours.

36:41.532 --> 36:42.867
Wow.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.202
If you look inside the machine,

36:45.202 --> 36:47.805
you'll see that there
are hundreds of nozzles.

36:47.805 --> 36:49.740
Those little nozzles

36:49.740 --> 36:52.743
spray a fine mist of water
out into the air

36:52.743 --> 36:54.312
and when the air is cool,

36:54.312 --> 36:57.214
and you've got the right
conditions, it makes snow.

36:57.214 --> 36:59.717
The challenge is
that when the water comes

36:59.717 --> 37:02.253
through this machine,
it has sediments in it,

37:02.253 --> 37:05.756
which clog up
these tiny little nozzles.

37:05.756 --> 37:07.858
So, at the end of every season,

37:07.858 --> 37:09.627
what do Lars and Tommy do?

37:09.627 --> 37:11.929
They replace these
with new ones.

37:11.929 --> 37:13.965
Like this one right here.

37:13.965 --> 37:16.334
That is your job today.

37:16.334 --> 37:18.269
When the work whistle blows,

37:18.269 --> 37:20.705
you've got two machines that
you need to get up and running.

37:20.705 --> 37:23.975
The first of you to get
both machines operational

37:23.975 --> 37:26.110
will be safe,
stay in contention

37:26.110 --> 37:27.211
for theTough As Nails title.

37:27.211 --> 37:29.113
If you finish this job last,

37:29.113 --> 37:31.616
you will be punching out.

37:31.616 --> 37:32.950
Are you ready
to get the job done?

37:32.950 --> 37:33.884
-I'm ready. Yep.
-KEOGHAN: Get to work?

37:33.884 --> 37:35.987
One hand on the snow cat.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.288
Let's go, ladies.

37:37.288 --> 37:39.056
-You got this.
-Give it all you got.

37:39.056 --> 37:40.224
-All you got.
-Savage Crew.

37:40.224 --> 37:42.226
On the work whistle.

37:48.265 --> 37:50.835
On the work whistle.

37:50.835 --> 37:52.203
-(work whistle blows)
-JEROME: Go, ladies!

37:52.203 --> 37:53.571
-LIA: All right!
-ELIZABETH: Go!

37:53.571 --> 37:55.006
KEOGHAN:
First, you gotta get

37:55.006 --> 37:56.907
that water supply on,
to test the machine.

37:56.907 --> 37:59.310
Then replace the nine clogged
or missing nozzles

37:59.310 --> 38:00.811
on each snow machine

38:00.811 --> 38:02.446
to get 'em up and running again.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.281
You know that Kalimba's
going to be good with hoses.

38:04.281 --> 38:06.283
-She's used to
rollin' them out, right?
-Absolutely. She's got it.

38:06.283 --> 38:08.152
-She's got it.
-The first of you to fix

38:08.152 --> 38:10.154
your two snow machines
will stay in

38:10.154 --> 38:11.822
the individual competition.

38:11.822 --> 38:13.424
-SARAH: Come on, Kelsy.
You got it.
-HARPER: Yeah.

38:13.424 --> 38:14.258
KEOGHAN: There you go,
get the water running

38:14.258 --> 38:15.259
and then they can see

38:15.259 --> 38:16.761
which nozzles need replacing.

38:16.761 --> 38:17.995
SARAH:
Turn the water off.

38:17.995 --> 38:20.164
LIA:
Come on, Kelsy. There you go.

38:20.164 --> 38:22.933
KEOGHAN:
There we have a pilot right
now, against a fire captain.

38:22.933 --> 38:24.268
Working the socket wrench,

38:24.268 --> 38:26.604
and then the bigger tool
is the torque wrench.

38:26.604 --> 38:28.139
Neither one of them,
I guarantee you,

38:28.139 --> 38:29.974
have never worked on
a snow machine before.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.342
-(Christine laughs)
-Oh, guarantee. Guarantee.

38:31.342 --> 38:32.543
CHRISTINE:
No doubt.

38:32.543 --> 38:34.679
KELSY:
I am an aerial sprayer

38:34.679 --> 38:37.515
and I have nozzles clog
all day, all the time.

38:37.515 --> 38:39.316
So, I knew what nozzle was wrong

38:39.316 --> 38:40.851
just based off looking at it,

38:40.851 --> 38:42.453
and this is my challenge.

38:42.453 --> 38:45.189
KEOGHAN:
Kelsy's got three of
her nine nozzles done.

38:45.189 --> 38:46.857
Looking for a click
on that torque wrench.

38:46.857 --> 38:49.293
Lookin' for 25 foot-pounds

38:49.293 --> 38:51.028
to make sure that
it's not over-tightened

38:51.028 --> 38:53.664
but tight enough to hold in
place with the water pressure.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.533
-(click)
-Did you hear that?

38:55.533 --> 38:57.068
-Nice! Yeah!
-There it is, got the click.

38:57.068 --> 38:58.302
LIA:
Come on, Kalimba.

38:58.302 --> 38:59.637
Get your head in the game,
let's go.

38:59.637 --> 39:01.138
KALIMBA:
So, as my job as a firefighter,

39:01.138 --> 39:03.307
we do have one big nozzle.

39:03.307 --> 39:06.243
I'm not used to working, like,
with little nozzles at all.

39:06.243 --> 39:08.179
I'm hitting my hands on the side

39:08.179 --> 39:09.980
and then actually had
to take off my gloves because

39:09.980 --> 39:11.649
it was easier to work
with the little nozzles

39:11.649 --> 39:12.917
when I could touch them.

39:12.917 --> 39:15.252
(nozzle clatters)

39:15.252 --> 39:16.587
-(clicks)
-ELIZABETH: Ah, click!

39:16.587 --> 39:18.489
-All right, Kelsy.
-Use your tools, Kalimba,

39:18.489 --> 39:19.957
-use your tools.
-KEOGHAN: Here we go.

39:19.957 --> 39:22.626
Kelsy, about to test
her first machine.

39:22.626 --> 39:24.695
-Looks good.
-Lars gives a thumbs-up.

39:24.695 --> 39:25.963
Yeah, that's right,
that's right.

39:25.963 --> 39:28.499
Kelsy gets the first
snow machine done.

39:28.499 --> 39:30.334
This is where Kalimba's gotta
keep her head.

39:30.334 --> 39:32.636
SARAH: Stay in it,
stay in it.

39:32.636 --> 39:33.771
KALIMBA: I realize
I'm trying to move too fast

39:33.771 --> 39:35.840
so I'm not going over
the steps like I should.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.608
Remember why you're here,
Kalimba.

39:37.608 --> 39:39.877
Calm, breathe
and do what you do.

39:39.877 --> 39:42.012
KEOGHAN: Kelsy moving on
to the second machine.

39:42.012 --> 39:43.547
-(grunts)
-SARAH: There you go, Kelsy.

39:43.547 --> 39:45.649
KEOGHAN:
We have a Savage Crew teammate

39:45.649 --> 39:47.885
up against Kalimba
from Dirty Hands.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.787
Kalimba's still
on that first machine,

39:49.787 --> 39:51.455
looking for the click
on that torque wrench.

39:51.455 --> 39:53.691
-Nice.
-There you go.

39:53.691 --> 39:55.726
There we go,
Kalimba's testing her machine.

39:55.726 --> 39:57.828
Looking for some good mist.

39:57.828 --> 39:58.896
-We're good?
-Yeah.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.464
Thumbs-up from Lars.

40:00.464 --> 40:02.166
Kalimba's coming back now.

40:02.166 --> 40:03.901
LIA:
Kelsy's gettin' in there.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.336
KEOGHAN:
Working with the socket wrench,
extremely quickly,

40:05.336 --> 40:06.904
one nozzle in her mouth.

40:06.904 --> 40:09.140
-This is when the pressure
goes on.
-MIKE: Oh, yeah.

40:09.140 --> 40:11.041
Kelsy's on
the torque wrench again.

40:11.041 --> 40:12.409
Come on, Kalimba.

40:12.409 --> 40:13.744
-(clicks)
-There's the click

40:13.744 --> 40:15.412
-on the torque wrench.
-KELSY: That's the last.

40:15.412 --> 40:16.547
Kelsy's got the last one in.

40:16.547 --> 40:18.749
She's going now to do the test.

40:18.749 --> 40:20.251
Whoa.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.086
-That's good.
-KEOGHAN: Looks good?

40:22.086 --> 40:23.387
-Yep.
-Fan on!

40:23.387 --> 40:24.889
-KEOGHAN: Fan's going on.
-(whooping)

40:24.889 --> 40:27.758
(cheering)

40:27.758 --> 40:29.527
And Kelsy gets the win.

40:29.527 --> 40:32.496
(cheering, whooping)

40:32.496 --> 40:36.534
KELSY:
It made me so proud that
I wasn't gonna clock out first.

40:36.534 --> 40:38.402
The confidence
that my dad gave me,

40:38.402 --> 40:40.337
that's what keeps me going,

40:40.337 --> 40:41.872
and that's what I did.
I didn't stop.

40:41.872 --> 40:44.408
-Yeah!
-(cheering)

40:45.876 --> 40:46.877
KEOGHAN: Every time
somebody gets eliminated

40:46.877 --> 40:48.746
it's tough, it's really hard.

40:48.746 --> 40:50.281
-I'm just happy to be here.
-KELSY: Yeah.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.049
-Yeah. Absolutely.
-KALIMBA: Like, so... Yeah.

40:52.049 --> 40:54.718
LIA:
Kalimba is key
to our team's success.

40:54.718 --> 40:58.722
I mean, when the rest of us are,
you know... (yelling)

40:58.722 --> 41:00.291
...she's like, "All right,
calm down, focus,

41:00.291 --> 41:02.092
let's go, move it."

41:02.092 --> 41:04.361
-Yeah.
-And-and we need her
on our team, and--

41:04.361 --> 41:06.130
and we need what she brings.

41:06.130 --> 41:08.365
That's my specialty.
I always have crews that are

41:08.365 --> 41:10.467
totally different, from
different parts of the world,

41:10.467 --> 41:13.537
different religions, different
political beliefs, you know?

41:13.537 --> 41:15.506
-And I'm able to, you know,
keep them together.
-Yeah.

41:15.506 --> 41:16.807
-Yeah.
-KALIMBA: It's what I do.

41:16.807 --> 41:18.742
This is what I do. (laughs)

41:18.742 --> 41:20.878
You're a fire captain
for a reason, obviously;

41:20.878 --> 41:22.413
-you earned your stripes, right?
-Yeah, yeah.

41:22.413 --> 41:24.181
But, Kalimba, unfortunately,

41:24.181 --> 41:26.483
you are out of
the individual competition

41:26.483 --> 41:28.719
-and I do need you to punch out.
-Yep.

41:34.825 --> 41:35.993
KALIMBA:
It's not a good feeling,

41:35.993 --> 41:37.161
to punch out
and be the first one.

41:40.764 --> 41:43.267
I know I don't have a chance
of winning the $200,000,

41:43.267 --> 41:45.536
but I do know I get to stay
with my team

41:45.536 --> 41:46.503
and we have
a chance to keep on winning.

41:52.276 --> 41:55.246
I'm here to prove to myself that
I can do things that are hard.

41:55.246 --> 41:57.114
I can push myself.
I'm here

41:57.114 --> 41:58.249
to find out what I'm made of.

41:58.249 --> 42:00.184
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

42:00.184 --> 42:01.285
Good job.

42:01.285 --> 42:02.853
Proud of you.

42:02.853 --> 42:03.988
KEOGHAN: Guys, get warm.
Get showered.

42:03.988 --> 42:05.389
Get fed, get ready.

42:05.389 --> 42:06.624
It's gonna get more brutal.

Empty everything and put them

42:29.647 --> 42:31.115
There's money to be made.
