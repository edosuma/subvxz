an extra lap.

you got a little oatmeal

have something to do with

have to end?

- When you're on an

03:46.684 --> 03:48.311
you don't have to take gym.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.562

- Well,
I'm proud of you, man.

those salads

- Potato chips?
- I have a problem!

05:47.513 --> 05:50.725

a little potato chip problem.

05:50.808 --> 05:51.601

05:55.938 --> 05:58.066
- What's that?

06:00.568 --> 06:02.111
Potato chips.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.321
- They look like
potato chips, don't they?

06:03.404 --> 06:05.615
- They're not
potato chips?

06:05.698 --> 06:07.909

No fat, no carbs,
and no calories.

You made these?

06:17.460 --> 06:18.252
- Mm-hmm.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.630
- Out of what?
- Well...

06:20.713 --> 06:22.507
I combined
macrobiotic sorbitol

06:22.590 --> 06:23.925
with luminescent beryllium,

06:24.008 --> 06:25.968
then added periodontal
molding gum

06:26.052 --> 06:28.805
with nordic acid infused
with potato gas.

06:29.764 --> 06:30.848

- Hey, Coach.

06:51.577 --> 06:52.161
- You're late.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.330
Now get to running.

06:54.413 --> 06:56.290
- Sorry, Coach,
but we just came by

06:56.374 --> 06:57.333
to tell you we won't
be running laps anymore.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.627
- What in the name
of captain pike

06:59.710 --> 07:00.670
are you talking about?

07:00.753 --> 07:02.338
- Well, you happen
to be looking at

07:02.421 --> 07:05.883
4 new members of PCA's new
official disc golf team.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.386
- Disc golf?

07:08.469 --> 07:10.721
Ha ha!
Disc golf!

07:10.805 --> 07:12.557
Disc go--
that ain't a sport, huh?

07:12.640 --> 07:15.810
What do you think I am,
some kind of tuna melt?

07:15.893 --> 07:18.062
- No,
but according to Dean Rivers,

07:18.146 --> 07:20.356
disc golf is now
an official PCA sport.

07:20.439 --> 07:22.316
- See? He signed the form
and everything.

- "Certified sport."

the dean myself.

Come on, run, people, run!

- Hey, I thought
you said you were gonna

07:50.136 --> 07:51.554
lay off those potato chips.
- I have been.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.515
- Those are Quinn's fake
potato chips.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.058
- Totally healthy.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.060
- I've been
eating these things nonstop,

07:58.144 --> 07:59.061
and I already lost 3 pounds.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.897
- Oh, wow.
That's very cool.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.106
- Thank you.
Now I'll just grab a disc

08:02.190 --> 08:04.901
and we can get started.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.072
- Uh, Michael?
- Yeah?

08:10.156 --> 08:12.450
- Are you ok, man?
You're walking kind of funny.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.076
- Oh, yeah.
It's just a side effect

08:14.160 --> 08:14.994
from eating Quinn's
potato chips,

08:15.077 --> 08:17.705
but don't worry.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.457
They're worth it.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.417
- Ok, whatever you say.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.712
- All right, you guys,
who's ready to play?

08:24.795 --> 08:25.796
- Wait.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.381
Before we start
our first practice,

08:27.465 --> 08:30.051
we got to pick a team captain,
and I nominate Zoey.

08:30.134 --> 08:31.052
- Zoey,
you're team captain.

08:31.135 --> 08:31.802
- Yay.
- Ok.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.429
Let's play disc golf!

08:37.390 --> 08:41.145
Uh...
how do you play disc golf?

08:44.315 --> 08:46.025
- Come on, Nicole,
you can do it.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.235
- It's all in the wrist.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.280
- [gasps]
Yay! I did it!

08:51.364 --> 08:55.576
- Nice!
And it only took you...

08:55.660 --> 08:58.120
48 shots to get it in.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.830
- I'm not very good, am I?

08:59.914 --> 09:01.082
- Aw, who cares?

09:01.165 --> 09:03.584
The point is we
don't have to run laps anymore.

09:03.668 --> 09:04.919
- True.
- Ok.

09:05.002 --> 09:05.670
Let's work on our drives.

a game for next week.

20:23.847 --> 20:24.806
ZOEY: Look,
we're probably gonna lose,

20:24.890 --> 20:26.600
so let's just
deal with it, ok?

20:26.683 --> 20:28.936
[whistle blows]

20:29.019 --> 20:30.145

Stop! I'm ordering you

Stop!
[alarm sounds]

20:39.655 --> 20:40.656
- Um, what just happened?

20:40.739 --> 20:43.992
- I think
the other team just escaped.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.330
CHASE: This has been
a really weird day.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.749
[whistle blowing]

20:50.832 --> 20:52.376
- Ok,
the Ridgeway team has fled

20:52.459 --> 20:54.336
before completion
of the tournament.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.254
PCA wins by forfeit.

[all cheering]

20:57.881 --> 21:00.425

21:00.509 --> 21:01.927
- Yeah, we won,
because of you!

21:02.010 --> 21:03.178

21:03.261 --> 21:05.305
- Yeah! That's it,
let's all get sushi.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.431
I'm buying.

21:08.141 --> 21:10.269
- Not so fast.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.311
- What?

21:11.395 --> 21:13.355
- How's your wrist?

21:13.438 --> 21:15.273
- Oh, yeah, my wrist.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.067
Yeah, it still hurts.

21:17.150 --> 21:20.862
- [sighs]
You're so full of it, Zo.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.781
Thanks for letting me play.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.534
But next time,
don't be so stupid.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.039
- They're gonna catch us!

21:31.123 --> 21:32.833
- We need a car!

21:32.916 --> 21:34.292
ALL: Stop! Stop!

21:34.376 --> 21:35.293
- Stop the car!
