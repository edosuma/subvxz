01:35.092 --> 01:37.126
Remember that for tonight!
Mmm-hmm.

01:44.234 --> 01:46.202
Your dad
is sounding good, Beshte.

01:46.236 --> 01:49.138
Thanks, Your Majesty.
He's been practicing.

01:49.172 --> 01:51.040
It's not every day
you get to be a part of

01:51.074 --> 01:52.341
the Kupatana celebration.

01:52.375 --> 01:55.511
Well, considering Kupatana
only happens once a year...

01:55.545 --> 01:57.368
And I can't wait!

01:57.369 --> 02:01.016
It's the biggest party
in the Pride Lands!

02:01.051 --> 02:03.052
It's not just a party, Bunga.

02:03.086 --> 02:05.254
Yes. Kupatana is the one day

02:05.288 --> 02:09.191
all the animals in the Pride
Lands gather side-by-side,

02:09.226 --> 02:12.027
to celebrate
the Circle of Life in peace.

02:12.062 --> 02:13.996
Yeah.

02:14.030 --> 02:17.066
It's the most peaceful day
of the year!

02:21.071 --> 02:22.204
I spoke too soon.

02:30.046 --> 02:32.314
Yep. It's Janja
and his hyenas.

02:32.349 --> 02:35.251
They're chasing a little
jackal pup though the Outlands.

02:35.285 --> 02:37.253
The Outlands.

02:37.287 --> 02:41.157
I wish the Lion Guard defended
the Circle of Life out there, too.

02:41.191 --> 02:42.358
But we don't...

02:42.392 --> 02:44.460
Kion, today is Kupatana.

02:44.494 --> 02:46.462
And not just here
in the Pride Lands.

02:46.496 --> 02:51.433
The spirit of Kupatana extends to
all the animals in the Circle of Life.

02:51.468 --> 02:53.269
Even those
in the Outlands.

02:53.303 --> 02:55.504
Of course.
You're right, Dad!

02:55.539 --> 02:57.506
Lion Guard, let's go!

02:57.541 --> 02:59.275
We're gonna save that pup!

02:59.309 --> 03:00.976
You got it, Kion!

03:01.011 --> 03:02.344
Zuka Zama!

03:02.379 --> 03:04.346
Till the Pride Land's end...

03:04.381 --> 03:07.183
<i>Lion Guard defend!</i>

03:08.351 --> 03:11.053
There he goes!
Come on, fellas!

03:16.059 --> 03:18.027
- Uh-oh!
- Whoa!

03:24.034 --> 03:25.234
Hmm?

03:25.268 --> 03:28.170
Oh, you jackals
are so annoying!

03:28.205 --> 03:30.472
We just chased ya
out of our den yesterday.

03:30.507 --> 03:32.208
And now you're back?

03:32.242 --> 03:35.044
Guess I need to make
an example of ya!

03:38.215 --> 03:39.348
Not today, Janja!

03:41.451 --> 03:45.087
Hey! Hey! Easy on the fur!

03:45.121 --> 03:47.223
What're you doing in the
Outlands, anyway?

03:47.257 --> 03:49.225
Making sure
you let that pup go!

03:49.259 --> 03:52.361
Yeah! Don't you know
today's Kupatana?

03:52.395 --> 03:55.231
Ku... Ku...
Kupatana?

03:57.167 --> 03:59.435
Okay, Kion.
You want the jackal?

03:59.469 --> 04:02.066
He's all yours!

04:02.239 --> 04:04.373
Uh, okay.

04:04.407 --> 04:09.311
C'mon fellas. The Lion
Guard's doin' us a favor today!

04:11.281 --> 04:14.016
Merry Kupatana!

04:17.053 --> 04:19.021
That was different.

04:19.055 --> 04:22.157
Yeah. You think Janja
celebrates Kupatana, too?

04:22.192 --> 04:23.993
I seriously doubt it.

04:24.027 --> 04:26.028
Thanks, you guys!
You were awesome!

04:26.062 --> 04:28.221
You were like, "Let the jackal go!"

04:28.251 --> 04:30.466
- And they did!
- Yeah. But why?

04:30.500 --> 04:33.202
Well, I'm glad we could help.

04:33.236 --> 04:35.170
Um...
I'm Dogo.

04:35.205 --> 04:37.072
And you guys must be
the Lion Guard!

04:37.107 --> 04:38.374
You're the coolest!

04:38.408 --> 04:40.309
You just looked at the
hyenas and they ran away!

04:40.343 --> 04:43.245
Yeah. We have that effect
on no-goods.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.114
You're safe now, Dogo.

04:45.148 --> 04:48.250
But I'd stay away from Janja's
territory if I were you.

04:48.285 --> 04:50.152
Are you guys going back
to the Pride Lands?

04:50.186 --> 04:51.420
I know I'd be safe there!

04:51.454 --> 04:54.023
Don't you need to get back
to your family, Dogo?

04:54.057 --> 04:56.225
I'm all by myself.

04:56.259 --> 04:59.028
But I know there are lots of
friendly animals in the Pride Lands!

04:59.062 --> 05:00.362
Can I please come with you?

05:01.231 --> 05:03.198
<i>Aw.</i>

05:03.233 --> 05:06.368
Well, it is Kupatana.

05:08.238 --> 05:10.239
Okay, Dogo. You can come.

05:14.010 --> 05:16.245
That's the signal!
He did it!

05:18.381 --> 05:21.417
The plan worked!
The Lion Guard rescued Dogo.

05:21.451 --> 05:23.319
Just like I knew they would.

05:23.353 --> 05:26.388
We're getting into the Pride
Lands just in time for Kupatana!

05:28.058 --> 05:29.124
Goigoi! Wake up!

05:31.261 --> 05:34.229
- Aw, I was sleeping!
- You're always sleeping.

05:34.264 --> 05:36.465
Listen! Dogo convinced
the Lion Guard

05:36.499 --> 05:38.400
to invite him into the Pride Lands.

05:38.435 --> 05:41.003
And when you invite one jackal...

05:41.037 --> 05:45.107
You invite us all!
I'll go round up the boys!

05:45.141 --> 05:50.079
All those animals coming
together in "peace" for Kupatana.

05:51.348 --> 05:53.082
They'll never know
what hit them!

05:53.516 --> 05:55.484
You sure about this, Kion?

05:55.518 --> 05:59.188
It seemed like Janja couldn't
wait to get rid of this jackal!

05:59.222 --> 06:01.090
It does seem odd.

06:01.124 --> 06:04.093
Well, I think we should at
least give Dogo a chance.

06:04.127 --> 06:07.296
You picked a great day
to get chased by hyenas, Dogo!

06:07.330 --> 06:09.264
- I did?
- Oh, yeah.

06:09.299 --> 06:13.235
Tonight, all of these baobab trees
will bloom for the very first time.

06:13.269 --> 06:17.272
And all the animals in the
Pride Lands come here to watch!

06:17.307 --> 06:20.075
It's what we call "Kupatana."

06:20.110 --> 06:23.012
I've heard about Kupatana.
But I've never seen it!

06:23.046 --> 06:24.113
I can't wait!

06:26.082 --> 06:28.217
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You can't invite him to Kupatana.

06:28.251 --> 06:29.451
He's an Outlander.

06:29.486 --> 06:33.355
Outlanders never come
to Kupatana. Right, Kion?

06:33.390 --> 06:36.742
Well, we've never had a guest from

06:36.743 --> 06:40.095
- the Outlands on Kupatana before.
- Hmm?

06:40.130 --> 06:43.886
But Dogo's just one little jackal.
It might be good for him

06:43.887 --> 06:46.168
to learn about Kupatana. Come on.

06:46.202 --> 06:48.237
- Poa!
- All right!

06:57.414 --> 06:58.726
Here you go, Dogo.

06:58.727 --> 07:01.350
You can make yourself
at home on this hillside.

07:01.384 --> 07:03.986
Yeah! It's the perfect spot!

07:04.020 --> 07:06.155
Just a short trot
to the watering hole.

07:06.189 --> 07:08.223
And look at the view!

07:10.193 --> 07:13.195
Okay. Well, thanks.

07:13.229 --> 07:15.364
Welcome to
the Pride Lands, Dogo.

07:15.398 --> 07:17.266
Now, let's split up
so we can

07:17.300 --> 07:20.002
finish our patrol
in time for Kupatana.

07:20.036 --> 07:22.371
Bunga, Beshte,
head to the watering hole.

07:22.405 --> 07:24.273
Sounds good.

07:24.307 --> 07:27.409
Ono, Fuli, you're with me.
We'll meet up back at the lair.

07:35.218 --> 07:38.153
Hello, son.

07:38.188 --> 07:41.892
- Mom, Mom! You heard my signal.
- That's right.

07:41.927 --> 07:44.393
And here we all are!
In the Pride Lands!

07:44.427 --> 07:48.464
Yep. This place sure beats
the Outlands.

07:50.266 --> 07:53.035
I really fooled the
Lion Guard, didn't I?

07:53.069 --> 07:55.270
Sure did, Dogo.
Great job.

07:55.305 --> 07:57.306
But why are you sitting out here?

07:57.340 --> 08:01.944
Uh, the Lion Guard said I could
stay on this hillside.

08:01.978 --> 08:03.412
Jackals don't sit
on hillsides.

08:03.446 --> 08:06.982
They have no idea what us
jackals are like, do they?

08:07.016 --> 08:10.152
When's this Kupatana thing start?
I'm hungry!

08:10.186 --> 08:12.054
Not for a while, honey.

08:12.088 --> 08:15.090
In the meantime,
let's make ourselves at home.

08:15.125 --> 08:16.258
Jackal style!

08:18.128 --> 08:20.362
Hey, Ma Tembo!
Happy Kupatana!

08:20.396 --> 08:22.364
Happy Kupatana, Beshte!

08:22.398 --> 08:25.000
Happy Kupatana, Mbuni!

08:25.034 --> 08:26.435
See you at the celebration tonight?

08:26.469 --> 08:29.238
Yep. Can't wait!

08:29.272 --> 08:32.274
Heya, Dogo.
Dogo?

08:32.308 --> 08:34.308
He's so cute!

08:34.344 --> 08:38.212
I know. But this is Muhanga
the aardvark's den.

08:38.248 --> 08:40.015
He can't stay here.

08:40.049 --> 08:41.383
Dogo?

08:41.417 --> 08:44.153
You got your own spot
on the hill, remember?

08:44.187 --> 08:47.422
Oh, right. Okay.

08:47.457 --> 08:48.758
Poor little fella.

08:48.759 --> 08:51.360
Must've gone for a walk and gotten lost.

08:51.394 --> 08:53.195
- Yeah.
- Whoa!

08:55.331 --> 08:59.034
- But I thought he...
- Dogo.

08:59.068 --> 09:00.302
Go back to your hill.

09:00.336 --> 09:02.882
This den belongs to
someone else, too.

09:05.175 --> 09:06.275
Weird.

09:08.978 --> 09:12.047
Dogo! 
These are aardvarks' dens!

09:12.081 --> 09:13.415
You can't stay here!

09:16.085 --> 09:19.254
- Uh... Bunga?
- Uh-huh.

09:19.289 --> 09:21.356
Hey! What's going on here?

09:21.391 --> 09:24.293
What are jackals doing in our den?

09:24.327 --> 09:27.062
Easy, everybody. Easy!

09:27.096 --> 09:29.131
- We'll take care of this.
- Yeah!

09:30.133 --> 09:31.166
How?

09:31.201 --> 09:34.036
Uh, only one thing to do.

09:34.470 --> 09:37.172
Kion!

09:37.207 --> 09:39.274
That was Bunga and Beshte!

09:39.309 --> 09:41.109
Ono! What do you see?

09:43.146 --> 09:44.346
Hapana!

09:44.380 --> 09:48.317
Kion, I think you need
to see this for yourself.

09:48.351 --> 09:51.286
Oh, okay, Ono.
Lead the way!

09:55.058 --> 09:56.425
What were you doing in there?

09:56.459 --> 09:58.293
Did you eat all my ants?

09:58.328 --> 10:01.163
Easy there! I'm sure
they didn't mean any harm.

10:02.465 --> 10:04.166
Heyvi kabisa!

10:04.200 --> 10:06.268
That's a lot of jackals!

10:09.138 --> 10:10.239
Where's Dogo?

10:10.273 --> 10:13.075
- You looking for my boy?
- Who are you?

10:13.109 --> 10:14.830
Didn't mean to startle ya.

10:14.831 --> 10:17.412
I'm Reirei, Dogo's mom. And this...

10:19.115 --> 10:21.016
Goigoi, get out here!

10:21.050 --> 10:23.452
...is Goigoi, Dogo's dad.

10:23.486 --> 10:27.189
- Hey! That's our den!
- And our fruit!

10:27.223 --> 10:29.191
It's such a lovely den.

10:29.225 --> 10:32.261
And the fruit's delicious!

10:32.295 --> 10:34.062
We didn't say you could eat it!

10:34.097 --> 10:38.133
You took our stuff without asking!
You're thieves!

10:38.167 --> 10:40.469
Thieves?
Us? Never!

10:40.503 --> 10:44.506
Enough!
Which one of you is Dogo?

10:44.540 --> 10:46.308
I'm right here, Kion.

10:46.342 --> 10:50.078
Dogo, I thought you said
you didn't have any family.

10:50.113 --> 10:53.148
Uh, no. I said I was
all by myself.

10:53.182 --> 10:56.251
Which he was,
at the time!

10:56.286 --> 10:59.454
My son always
tells the truth.

10:59.489 --> 11:03.025
But when he went into the Pride
Lands, we had to follow him.

11:03.059 --> 11:06.094
You can't expect a little
pup to live in a strange place

11:06.129 --> 11:09.197
without his mom and dad.
Right, Goigoi?

11:13.436 --> 11:15.404
Whatever you say, dear.

11:15.438 --> 11:19.141
And we couldn't leave our other
kids alone in the Outlands.

11:19.175 --> 11:21.009
What kind of parents
would do that?

11:22.245 --> 11:23.378
Okay, yeah.

11:23.413 --> 11:26.315
- I can see that. But...
- Ah! Help!

11:33.189 --> 11:35.257
Kion! Mbeya the rhino...

11:35.291 --> 11:36.458
He's trapped in a mud pit.

11:36.492 --> 11:38.327
All the way over
at Lake Matope.

11:38.361 --> 11:40.128
We'll need to get moving.

11:40.163 --> 11:42.064
Okay, Reirei.

11:42.098 --> 11:45.167
You and your family have to stay
away from the aardvarks' dens.

11:45.201 --> 11:48.337
- And food. Got it?
- Oh, yes.

11:48.371 --> 11:51.373
And I'm so sorry
for any misunderstanding.

11:53.343 --> 11:55.110
Lion Guard, follow me!

11:57.180 --> 11:58.413
Come on, kids!

11:58.448 --> 12:00.415
Let's leave these nice
aardvarks to their business.

12:00.450 --> 12:02.384
We'll find someplace else to go.

12:02.418 --> 12:04.186
Yeah, you do that.

12:05.421 --> 12:07.222
You were right, Reirei.

12:07.256 --> 12:10.392
The Pride Lands is filled
with great things to take.

12:10.426 --> 12:14.162
Just wait for that big old
Kupatana celebration.

12:14.197 --> 12:17.265
All the Pride
Lands' animals in one place!

12:17.300 --> 12:19.301
Mmm-mmm.

12:19.335 --> 12:21.269
Now, let's help
ourselves to more

12:21.304 --> 12:23.438
of the Pride Landers'
generosity.

12:23.473 --> 12:27.209
But, Mom, won't Kion and the Lion
Guard get mad and kick us out?

12:27.243 --> 12:29.478
Dogo, Dogo, Dogo.

12:29.512 --> 12:32.314
Today is the one day
these silly Pride Landers

12:32.348 --> 12:34.182
will let us get away
with anything.

12:34.217 --> 12:35.250
Right, Goigoi?

12:35.284 --> 12:36.351
Yup!

12:36.386 --> 12:40.455
Because it's Kupatana.

Has there been

14:59.128 --> 15:02.364
Whew.
Thank you so much.

15:02.398 --> 15:04.132
Hakuna Matata, Mbeya.

15:04.166 --> 15:06.101
Happens to
all of us sometimes.

15:08.304 --> 15:12.407
Maybe next time you could get
stuck in mud that isn't so sticky.

15:12.441 --> 15:14.142
It's okay.

15:14.176 --> 15:16.244
We've still got time
to hit the watering hole

15:16.279 --> 15:18.280
and get cleaned up
before the celebration.

15:20.216 --> 15:21.416
Or maybe not.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.187
Nothing to see here.

15:26.222 --> 15:27.455
Move along.

15:27.490 --> 15:29.190
I'm sorry, Kion.

15:29.225 --> 15:31.192
I just don't understand
why everyone's so upset.

15:31.227 --> 15:34.262
Yeah. We didn't take
anything from the aardvarks.

15:34.297 --> 15:39.167
- What about all these other animals?
- Oh, them? Well...

15:39.201 --> 15:40.435
It was just
a misunderstanding.

15:40.469 --> 15:45.040
A misunderstanding?
Is that what they call stealing food

15:45.074 --> 15:48.076
and invading other animals'
homes in the Outlands?

15:48.110 --> 15:51.479
Well, yes, it is.
Things are so different out there.

15:51.514 --> 15:53.248
How could we possibly know

15:53.282 --> 15:55.283
what's acceptable in the Pride Lands?

15:55.318 --> 15:56.451
Give me a break.

15:56.485 --> 15:58.186
Kion, you don't know how hard it is

15:58.220 --> 16:00.221
to start over in a strange place.

16:00.256 --> 16:02.190
We just don't know how to fit in.

16:02.224 --> 16:05.393
We do so want to be accepted
as part of your community.

16:05.428 --> 16:08.296
Don't you Pride Landers
have a word for that?

16:09.198 --> 16:10.231
We do.

16:10.266 --> 16:13.255
It's Kupatana.
We're actually gathering

16:13.290 --> 16:15.971
in Mizimu Grove tonight
to celebrate Kupatana.

16:16.005 --> 16:17.072
Kupatana.

16:17.406 --> 16:19.407
Ku-pa-tana.

16:21.010 --> 16:22.978
It sounds lovely.

16:23.012 --> 16:25.280
Do you think
we jackals can be

16:25.314 --> 16:27.449
a part of your Kupatana?

16:29.151 --> 16:32.053
Maybe, but only
if you can treat

16:32.088 --> 16:34.322
everyone in the
Pride Lands with respect.

16:34.357 --> 16:36.024
Can you and
your family do that?

16:36.058 --> 16:37.292
Oh, yes.

16:37.326 --> 16:40.328
I think we understand now.
Right, Goigoi?

16:41.263 --> 16:42.364
Goigoi!

16:44.333 --> 16:46.001
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Huh?

16:46.035 --> 16:48.069
Uh, yeah,
whatever you say, dear.

16:48.471 --> 16:51.039
Okay. Now we should go.

16:51.073 --> 16:53.441
We need to clean up
for the Kupatana celebration.

16:53.476 --> 16:55.076
But I hope we'll see you there.

16:57.346 --> 17:00.215
Oh, they'll see us there,
all right.

17:00.249 --> 17:02.350
Won't they, Goigoi?

- Shh. It's starting.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.334
Thank you all for joining us.

17:53.369 --> 17:56.237
We're here not just to witness

17:56.272 --> 17:59.040
the blooming of the baobab flowers,

17:59.075 --> 18:01.976
but to celebrate our community.

18:02.011 --> 18:03.411
Our Kupatana.

18:03.446 --> 18:06.281
And to honor all of our roles
in the Circle of Life.

18:09.151 --> 18:12.387
It is time.

18:29.138 --> 18:30.238
Wow.

18:30.272 --> 18:32.407
This is so unexpected.

18:32.441 --> 18:34.375
I didn't think I'd be so moved.

18:34.410 --> 18:36.444
What? By a bunch of flowers?

18:36.479 --> 18:40.315
No, by all the options.

18:40.349 --> 18:42.183
All these delicious
little animals,

18:42.218 --> 18:43.351
all in one place.

18:43.385 --> 18:45.053
How will we ever know
where to begin?

18:45.087 --> 18:48.323
I don't know.
Let's dig in.

18:48.357 --> 18:52.193
And now, let the Kupatana
celebration...

18:52.228 --> 18:53.294
Begin?

18:55.030 --> 18:56.364
- Oh, no.
- Dogo.

18:56.398 --> 18:57.432
I knew it.

19:01.370 --> 19:02.971
What is going on?

19:03.005 --> 19:06.207
- It's Reirei and her jackal family!
- Jackal family?

19:06.242 --> 19:09.144
Sorry, Dad.
This is my fault.

19:09.178 --> 19:10.378
But I know what to do.

19:10.412 --> 19:12.347
Everyone! Don't be afraid!

19:12.381 --> 19:15.250
You can all help the Lion
Guard by defending each other!

19:15.284 --> 19:17.051
Kion is right.

19:17.086 --> 19:21.022
If we stand together,
no Outlanders can defeat us.

19:21.056 --> 19:23.024
We've gotta round up
these jackals

19:23.058 --> 19:25.994
and send them back to the
Outlands where they belong.

19:26.028 --> 19:27.228
- Ono?
- Affirmative.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.268
Fuli! I see Goigoi!

19:33.302 --> 19:34.969
Behind the elephants!

19:35.404 --> 19:37.038
Huwezi!

19:38.240 --> 19:40.175
Nowhere to run, Goigoi!

19:40.209 --> 19:41.342
That's what you think.

19:45.047 --> 19:47.248
Beshte! Jackal pups
near the giraffes!

19:50.452 --> 19:52.120
Enough with the nipping.

19:57.293 --> 19:59.394
Come on, where are you, Reirei?

19:59.428 --> 20:01.229
Zuka Zama!

20:02.364 --> 20:04.199
Got you, Dogo.

20:04.233 --> 20:07.035
You know what?
I don't think you're cute anymore.

20:07.069 --> 20:09.304
Now, now, little one,
it'll all be over quick.

20:11.273 --> 20:13.041
Drop the hyrax.

20:14.109 --> 20:16.244
Why, Kion.
What's got you so upset?

20:17.479 --> 20:19.414
You lied to me, Reirei.

20:19.448 --> 20:22.250
Oh, no.
Did we make another mistake?

20:22.284 --> 20:25.220
- These Pride Land rules...
- Save it.

20:25.254 --> 20:28.389
You're going back to the Outlands.
All of you.

20:28.424 --> 20:30.058
Just one more chance.

20:30.092 --> 20:32.121
- That's all we...
- You heard my son.

20:32.528 --> 20:35.129
Leave. Now.

20:35.464 --> 20:38.399
Oh. Simba.

20:38.434 --> 20:40.335
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

20:42.204 --> 20:44.138
You know what they say,
there's no place like home!

20:44.173 --> 20:46.307
- Let's go, kids!
- Whatever you say, dear!

20:49.178 --> 20:51.346
- Kion?
- I'm sorry, Dad.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.147
Don't forget, Kion.

20:53.182 --> 20:56.317
I encouraged you to save that
jackal pup this morning.

20:56.352 --> 21:00.221
Yeah, but you didn't tell me to
invite him into the Pride Lands.

21:00.256 --> 21:02.123
You made a mistake, Kion.

21:02.157 --> 21:05.126
But you made it
in the spirit of Kupatana.

21:05.160 --> 21:07.195
You gave strangers
a chance to fit in.

21:07.229 --> 21:10.265
And tonight we saw
Kupatana in action.

21:10.299 --> 21:12.166
All the animals of the Pride Lands

21:12.201 --> 21:15.136
- standing together as one.
- Thanks, Dad.

21:15.170 --> 21:18.106
I guess this
year's celebration's over.

21:18.140 --> 21:19.340
You kidding?

21:19.375 --> 21:22.377
Usually we just get to
look at these things.

21:25.047 --> 21:28.149
Mmm. This is the best
Kupatana ever.

21:30.319 --> 21:32.253
Mmm.

21:32.288 --> 21:34.322
Have to admit, Bunga's right.

21:34.356 --> 21:37.125
These baobab blossoms
are delicious.

21:42.264 --> 21:44.032
You see, Kion?

21:44.066 --> 21:46.267
Everything has its place.

21:46.302 --> 21:50.071
Yeah.
It's the Circle of Life.

21:50.105 --> 21:51.306
Happy Kupatana, Dad.
