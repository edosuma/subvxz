00:09.270 --> 00:11.707
- My mom was picked up
by ICE last night.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.839
- Did you tell Jessica?
- I can't be a problem to her.

00:13.883 --> 00:15.015
- Yoli, this is your mom.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.929
- All those people
at the apartment

00:16.973 --> 00:18.409
forced out of their homes--

00:18.453 --> 00:20.846
I was too guilty to tell them
that I'm staying here.

00:20.890 --> 00:23.023
- I wish I could go to that
conference with you next week.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.067
- What, you're not going?

00:24.111 --> 00:25.286
Come with me.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.679
- People will wonder
why I'm there.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.420
- What's going on, Nicky?
- It didn't go as planned.

00:29.464 --> 00:30.813
He's dead.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.293
- He's got you on tape, Nick!

00:36.514 --> 00:38.386
- Aah!

00:38.429 --> 00:40.040
- I have to go get Ickaris
for McGann.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.563
- She's right.
He has you.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.347
- You know I owe him.
- If he can do this,

00:43.391 --> 00:45.567
it's more than owing--
what are you into, Bobby?

00:45.610 --> 00:47.525
- You killed Tommy Diehl
for McGann, didn't you?

00:47.569 --> 00:49.527
Running isn't going to solve
the problem.

00:49.571 --> 00:52.356
Let me help you.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.576
- I got conned
by the immigration lawyer.

00:54.619 --> 00:55.794
- What do you mean "conned"?

00:55.838 --> 00:57.492
- He just took my money,
and he never showed.

00:57.535 --> 01:00.538
- Either you tell Jessica,
or I will.

01:05.369 --> 01:08.155
- When I was a waitress
after college,

01:08.198 --> 01:10.113
I made sure to put
a few dollars in a jar

01:10.157 --> 01:12.072
after every shift,

01:12.115 --> 01:15.466
no matter how much I made.

01:15.510 --> 01:18.208
It took me so many shifts
to get that money.

01:18.252 --> 01:20.689
He just took it.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.391
I'm so stupid.

01:29.828 --> 01:31.569
- It's not your fault.

01:31.613 --> 01:33.397
And I'll make sure
you get that money back.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.704
- It's not even
about the money.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.140
I'm so mad at myself.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.489
I was so wrapped up
in my own life

01:38.533 --> 01:42.102
that I didn't even remember
she was going into ICE.

01:42.145 --> 01:43.755
And I always remember.

01:43.799 --> 01:46.106
She hugged me so tight,

01:46.149 --> 01:48.020
and I didn't even
pick up on it.

01:48.064 --> 01:49.892
- You couldn't have done
anything.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.372
She was going in anyway.

01:51.415 --> 01:52.808
- I could have told her that
the climate's different now.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.940
I could have told her that
they're looking for reasons

01:54.984 --> 01:56.420
to throw people
out of this country.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.422
- And I'm sure she knew that.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.294
Yoli...

02:00.337 --> 02:02.557
you knowing she was going in

02:02.600 --> 02:05.386
would not have prevented her
from being detained.

02:05.429 --> 02:06.952
- I know.

02:06.996 --> 02:09.607
- Am I that much of a monster
that you couldn't tell me?

02:09.651 --> 02:11.131
No.

02:11.174 --> 02:13.916
I've just been messing up
so much since I got here,

02:13.959 --> 02:15.309
and...

02:17.137 --> 02:18.616
I didn't--

02:18.660 --> 02:21.706
- You didn't want to be
the source of any more drama.

02:21.750 --> 02:24.492
- Yeah.

02:24.535 --> 02:25.754
And now look.

02:25.797 --> 02:28.974
- First of all,
you haven't been messing up.

02:29.018 --> 02:30.976
You've been a godsend.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.935
And second,
this isn't drama, Yoli.

02:32.978 --> 02:34.371
This is life.

02:34.415 --> 02:37.157
And right now you need someone
who's on your side.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.160
- I need someone
to bring my mom home.

02:40.203 --> 02:41.378
Can you do that?

02:41.422 --> 02:43.075
- I can't make any promises,

02:43.119 --> 02:46.166
but the first thing we're gonna
do is find you a real lawyer.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.657
- Derrick Mayes.
- Hey, Derrick.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.050
It's Stephanie Novak.

03:01.093 --> 03:02.269
- Mrs. Novak, how are you?

03:02.312 --> 03:04.184
- I'm well.
Hey, how's your mom?

03:04.227 --> 03:05.620
- She's still talking

03:05.663 --> 03:07.317
about that shepherd's pie
recipe you sent her.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.667
Well, give her my regards.

03:09.711 --> 03:13.628
Um, listen,
Bobby left in such a hurry.

03:13.671 --> 03:16.283
I was thinking,
that speech on health care--

03:16.326 --> 03:17.762
it's really important to him.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.460
- Yeah, he actually wrote
that one himself.

03:19.503 --> 03:21.113
It was pretty good,
I hate to say.

03:21.157 --> 03:24.247
- He can write when he has to.
- Yeah, don't tell him that.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.814
I don't want to lose
the little job security I have.

03:25.857 --> 03:29.034
-  Don't worry,
you're not going anywhere.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.079
So is someone going to be

03:30.122 --> 03:31.863
giving the speech
in Bobby's place?

03:31.907 --> 03:33.256
And please, God,
don't say Lloyd.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.910
I mean, he is the sweetest man,

03:34.953 --> 03:36.216
but he will have
people sleeping

03:36.259 --> 03:37.695
by the second paragraph.

03:37.739 --> 03:40.524
-  I'm not sure
what the plan is on that,

03:40.568 --> 03:43.266
but I can check in with Keri,
since she's the one going.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.358
- Keri's going?

03:48.402 --> 03:49.838
Uh, when was that decided?

03:49.881 --> 03:52.536
- A few weeks ago, I think.
I'm not really sure.

03:54.973 --> 03:56.714
Are you there?

03:56.758 --> 03:59.587
- Sorry. Yeah, I'm--
I'm still here.

03:59.630 --> 04:02.981
- Should I have her call you?
- No, that won't be necessary.

04:03.025 --> 04:05.070
I'm sure that Miss Allen

04:05.114 --> 04:08.117
has everything under control.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.553
Um...

04:09.597 --> 04:11.555
thank you so much, Derrick.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.818
- No problem.

04:20.129 --> 04:23.263
Oh, Bobby.

04:52.204 --> 04:54.598
- You Nick?
- You got what I asked for?

04:57.079 --> 04:58.776
- Brand-new .38.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.606
You got the money?

05:06.175 --> 05:08.133
I was never here.

05:29.024 --> 05:30.634
- Whatever it is, save it.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.070
I'm already late
for the airport.

05:32.114 --> 05:34.508
- Bobby's not going.
- I know.

05:34.551 --> 05:37.162
- You know?
When'd you find out?

05:37.206 --> 05:38.599
- Last night.

05:38.642 --> 05:41.602
He's, uh, going to Seattle
to wrap up the Ickaris deal.

05:41.645 --> 05:44.126
- Yeah, that's what he said to
me, and I didn't buy it then.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.780
- Where is the Wyatt brief?

05:45.823 --> 05:47.172
Somebody has to file this
while I'm gone.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.739
- Come on, Keri,
the press is gonna ask

05:48.783 --> 05:50.088
why he's skipping
the conference

05:50.132 --> 05:51.873
to wrap up a deal
he just said he wrapped up.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.788
I need something.
- What do you want me to say?

05:53.831 --> 05:55.877
You were right?
You were right.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.313
- What is that
supposed to mean?

05:57.357 --> 05:58.793
- It means that the CEO

05:58.836 --> 06:00.272
thinks that Bobby stole
all the glory,

06:00.316 --> 06:02.057
and now he's pissed because
we went public without him,

06:02.100 --> 06:04.929
so they're trying to squeeze us
on the details.

06:04.973 --> 06:07.715
- Might say I told you so,
but I guess you just did.

06:07.758 --> 06:09.107
- Gloat much?

06:09.151 --> 06:11.632
- By the way, I just spoke
with Stephanie Novak.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.547
She's going with you.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.157
- Where?
- Los Angeles.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.986
She said she's feeling good,
and she wants to go.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.509
I thought you liked her.

06:19.553 --> 06:22.164
- I do.
- Okay. Then...

06:22.207 --> 06:24.471
- Yeah, great.
Yeah, thanks for the heads-up.

06:34.524 --> 06:37.179
- Aha. I see you still have
your New York number.

06:37.222 --> 06:38.615
Don't get any ideas.

06:38.659 --> 06:39.834
I'm happy where I am.

06:39.877 --> 06:42.010
Did you get my message?
- Yeah, I did.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.360
It turns out my friend Ivan
from Harvard

06:44.404 --> 06:46.667
is the top immigration guy
at Sidley.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.016
- And?
- He won't take it.

06:48.059 --> 06:50.366
- Well, maybe Sidley's
too big for this.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.498
- Well, that's the thing.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.151
He checked
with three boutique firms,

06:53.195 --> 06:54.979
and they all say
the same thing--it's a loser.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.851
- They haven't even met
the woman.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.374
- He said they don't have to.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.116
Unless she's seeking asylum
or has some great story

07:01.159 --> 07:02.987
to bring attention to the firm,

07:03.031 --> 07:04.685
it's just not worth
their time, Jessica.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.208
- Damn it.

07:06.251 --> 07:07.818
- I thought you were
out of the pro bono business

07:07.862 --> 07:10.386
since you took the job
with the mayor.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.867
- I am.
This is for my new assistant.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.129
Her mother's undocumented.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.696
- You're a good woman,
Jessica Pearson.

07:15.739 --> 07:18.133
- Uh-huh.
- I'm serious.

07:18.176 --> 07:20.918
You always treated me like
family no matter what I did.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.703
I just hope
this young woman realizes

07:22.746 --> 07:24.008
how lucky she has it.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.402
- Right now
she's not very lucky at all.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.622
But thank you, Louis.

07:28.665 --> 07:31.233
You're a good man.
- I miss you.

07:31.276 --> 07:33.017
- I miss you, too.
- You do?

07:33.061 --> 07:35.063
Can you just repeat that
so I can record it

07:35.106 --> 07:36.891
and play it back for Harvey?
- Losing you.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.719
- I said, can you just--
can you just repeat it

07:38.762 --> 07:40.285
so I can play it--
Here, go ahead.

07:40.329 --> 07:42.244
What--Jessica, what'd you say?
Jessica, what'd you say?

07:42.287 --> 07:44.986
"I said I miss you, Louis."

07:45.029 --> 07:46.422
All right, thanks, Jess.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.902
- Bye, Louis.

07:51.601 --> 07:52.863
Have you seen Keri?

07:52.907 --> 07:54.778
It's a legal question,
and it's time-sensitive.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.345
- She's out.

07:56.388 --> 07:59.000
Is this about Yoli's mother?
- So you know.

07:59.043 --> 08:00.305
- I tried to convince her
to tell you,

08:00.349 --> 08:01.785
but she kept saying
that she got this,

08:01.829 --> 08:03.613
even after that scumbag lawyer
ripped her off.

08:03.657 --> 08:04.962
- Well, here's your chance
to help.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.268
- Give it to me.

08:06.311 --> 08:07.922
- Find a way to get her story
in the press.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.837
- Shit, that's not exactly
what I had--

08:09.880 --> 08:11.273
- If it can happen to a Dreamer

08:11.316 --> 08:13.231
working at City Hall,
it can happen to anyone.

08:13.275 --> 08:14.668
Let's see a judge try
and deport her

08:14.711 --> 08:15.886
while the whole city's
watching.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.540
- I already went behind
Bobby's back once.

08:17.584 --> 08:18.715
I can't do that again.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.456
- No, I'll take the heat
from the mayor.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.544
- No, it's not about me.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.111
If it gets out
that the mayor's office

08:23.154 --> 08:24.939
is playing favorites
in an immigration case,

08:24.982 --> 08:26.767
my credibility,
Bobby's credibility--

08:26.810 --> 08:28.246
it falls to zero.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.074
Look, there's nothing more
I want to do than help Yoli,

08:30.118 --> 08:31.728
but I can't cross that line.

08:31.772 --> 08:33.600
- I respect that, but you know
I'm not going to stop trying.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.950
- I wouldn't want you to.
- When does Keri get back?

08:35.993 --> 08:38.779
- Wednesday. She's going to LA
with the First Lady.

08:38.822 --> 08:40.128
- Excuse me?

08:40.171 --> 08:41.477
- Yeah, Ickaris is blowing up.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.348
Bobby had to go to Seattle.
He didn't tell you?

08:43.392 --> 08:45.394
- No, this is the first
I'm hearing of it.

08:45.437 --> 08:47.788
- Is everything okay
with Keri and Mrs. Novak?

08:47.831 --> 08:49.137
- Of course it is.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.226
I just don't like being
kept out of the loop.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.623
Did you set up that lunch
with the Chamber of Commerce?

08:56.666 --> 08:58.973
- Yeah, 12:30 at Brass Heart.
Was that okay?

08:59.016 --> 09:00.365
I can switch it up
if it's too--

09:00.409 --> 09:02.542
- Cancel it.
We're gonna see your mother.

09:02.585 --> 09:03.847
- Now?

09:03.891 --> 09:06.589
- You want action, don't you?
- Hell, yeah.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.504
Yes. I mean, um,
thank you.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.940
Are we gonna meet
the lawyer there?

09:09.984 --> 09:11.202
- I'm your lawyer for now.

09:11.246 --> 09:12.508
- I thought you weren't
a lawyer anymore.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.249
- I'm not,
but all I have to do today

09:14.292 --> 09:15.729
is take your mother
through the process

09:15.772 --> 09:17.252
and let her know
what to expect.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.080
- So what about her hearing
on Friday?

09:19.123 --> 09:20.342
You can't represent her there.

09:20.385 --> 09:21.996
- I have some calls
into a few clinics.

09:22.039 --> 09:24.694
- "Clinics"? That's your idea
of a real lawyer?

09:24.738 --> 09:26.000
Nuh-uh. No, no, no.
- Yoli.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.392
- No, I'm going to make sure
she at least gets

09:27.436 --> 09:29.003
a court-appointed defender
of some kind.

09:29.046 --> 09:30.526
- Yoli.
- I'm not asking you to do it.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.528
I'm gonna find one myself.
It's going to be fine.

09:32.572 --> 09:36.010
- Yoli,
your mother's not a citizen.

09:36.053 --> 09:37.794
She's not entitled to one.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.364
We're gonna get through this.

09:42.407 --> 09:43.844
I promise.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.759
- I thought
you didn't make promises.

09:45.802 --> 09:48.283
- I'm changing my policy.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.731
- Mrs. Novak.

10:01.775 --> 10:05.039
- So the rumors are true?
- Sorry?

10:05.082 --> 10:07.519
- I heard you were also going
to the conference.

10:07.563 --> 10:08.869
- Oh, yeah.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.914
Last chance for some color
before winter.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.612
- Please, look at me.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.570
I will definitely be
the palest person there.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.572
- Here, let me help you.
- No, no, no.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.443
I got it.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.233
Excuse me.
- Sure.

10:31.021 --> 10:33.415
- I hope I'm not intruding.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.765
Bobby asked me to deliver
his speech.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.593
- Oh, no, not at all.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.074
I'm--Public speaking
is not my thing, so I'm glad.

10:40.117 --> 10:41.815
Well...

10:41.858 --> 10:43.381
I hope you're not
too bored, then.

10:43.425 --> 10:45.166
- No, I have a lot of business
to attend to.

10:45.209 --> 10:46.733
There's actually a panel
for City Attorneys.

10:46.776 --> 10:50.040
- Oh, good. I was worried
that you were just coming along

10:50.084 --> 10:52.216
to fill in for the mayor.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.871
- Nope.
Like I said, lots to do.

10:54.915 --> 10:56.264
- Oh, good.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.874
- Fasten your seat belts,
please.

10:57.918 --> 11:00.094
- Oh, yeah, can I give you...

11:00.137 --> 11:01.617
Thank you.

11:01.661 --> 11:05.621
You know, I was thinking about
it on the way over here...

11:05.665 --> 11:08.755
what little time you and I
have spent together.

11:08.798 --> 11:12.976
I mean, you've been with
my husband for how many years?

11:13.020 --> 11:15.152
- Almost two.
- Oh.

11:15.196 --> 11:17.589
This is long overdue, then.

11:53.930 --> 11:57.064
- Mami.

12:07.509 --> 12:10.120
- Yes, this is my boss,
Jessica Pearson.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.295
- Hi.

12:11.339 --> 12:14.646
- You're the famous
Ms. Pearson.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.519
Thank you so much
for taking care of my Yoli.

12:17.562 --> 12:20.130
- It's your daughter
who's taking care of me.

12:20.174 --> 12:22.437
- That's very sweet.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.138
A-are you also a lawyer?

12:28.182 --> 12:30.662
- Oh, she used to be.
- It's a long story.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.490
But the bottom line is,
is that I'll be able

12:32.534 --> 12:34.057
to petition the court
on your behalf.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.233
You'll have an actual attorney
for your hearing.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.322
- Yes, you're going to have
an excellent lawyer,

12:38.366 --> 12:39.628
so don't worry.

12:39.671 --> 12:42.587
- I am so nervous.
- Don't be.

12:42.631 --> 12:43.980
It's just a bond hearing.

12:44.024 --> 12:46.896
The hearing to fight
deportation is in a few weeks,

12:46.940 --> 12:50.334
and all you'll have to do there
is be completely honest.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.383
- Mami...

12:55.426 --> 12:57.167
- My mother immigrated
from Cuba

12:57.211 --> 12:59.082
when she was a teenager.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.389
I'm the daughter
of an immigrant.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.826
- So you know.

13:03.870 --> 13:07.177
When we had Yoni, we wanted
to give her the best life

13:07.221 --> 13:08.526
and the best education.

13:08.570 --> 13:11.703
When she was two, we had
put together enough money

13:11.747 --> 13:13.357
to get across the border.

13:13.401 --> 13:15.533
This is our home now.

13:15.577 --> 13:16.926
I don't want to go back.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.885
- And I don't want you to,
Mrs. Castillo.

13:18.928 --> 13:21.757
But these people--
they already have you.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.803
And now they're looking
for any reason

13:23.846 --> 13:25.456
to send you back.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.852
- I don't understand.
- If you've done anything

13:29.896 --> 13:31.549
since being in this country,

13:31.593 --> 13:35.379
if you've done anything at all
that you haven't told me...

13:39.819 --> 13:41.864
- Ms. Pearson just wants
to make sure

13:41.908 --> 13:44.736
that nothing goes wrong.
- I didn't mean to offend you.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.478
I just want to make sure
that you're prepared.

13:47.522 --> 13:48.915
Hang in there.

13:48.958 --> 13:51.221
We're gonna get you
out of here.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.880
- I don't get you,
Ms. Pearson.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.056
One minute you say you want
to help my family, the next

14:00.100 --> 14:02.015
you're interrogating my mother
like she's a criminal.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.625
- I didn't say
she was a criminal.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.148
- Well, it sounded like that.
- No.

14:05.192 --> 14:07.672
But I do think
she's withholding something.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.457
- See?
Oh, my God.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.980
- I know it hurts to hear--

14:11.024 --> 14:12.721
- Yeah,
I don't want to hear it.

14:12.764 --> 14:14.854
- Yoli, when you keep secrets
long enough,

14:14.897 --> 14:16.899
you begin to sense when other
people are doing the same.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.596
- Yeah, well, check
your spidey senses

14:18.640 --> 14:19.989
'cause you're way off base.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.730
- Yoli.
- Way, way off base.

14:21.773 --> 14:23.993
- And if I'm not?
The sooner we know--

14:24.037 --> 14:26.343
- My mother doesn't lie,
Ms. Pearson.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.606
When you clean other people's
houses for 20 years,

14:28.650 --> 14:29.912
when you're around
their children,

14:29.956 --> 14:31.435
when you're around
their jewelry,

14:31.479 --> 14:32.784
when you're around
their money,

14:32.828 --> 14:35.787
you don't work
if you're a dishonest person.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.877
My mother doesn't lie.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.800
- Angela.
Is that room almost ready?

14:48.844 --> 14:50.106
We're getting backed up
in the ER.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.456
- I just finished.
- Okay, Mrs. Smith up on 7th

14:52.500 --> 14:54.023
needs to be bathed, and then--

14:54.067 --> 14:56.112
- Actually, I was wondering
if I could take off early?

14:56.156 --> 14:57.897
- Early?
You're signed up for a double,

14:57.940 --> 15:00.203
and you already missed part
of last night.

15:00.247 --> 15:02.379
- I know,
but I got someone to cover me.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.468
- Who?
- Roxanne.

15:04.512 --> 15:08.603
- Roxanne, who...
- I can find someone else.

15:08.646 --> 15:11.127
- It's okay.
If you have to go, go.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.955
- Thank you.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.392
- Angela, you're
one of my best CNAs.

15:15.436 --> 15:18.178
That's why I recommended you
for the nursing program.

15:18.221 --> 15:19.875
But this isn't
a fast-food place

15:19.919 --> 15:21.137
where just anyone
can fill in.

15:21.181 --> 15:22.878
If you can't make this job
a priority,

15:22.922 --> 15:24.619
then maybe nursing
isn't right for you.

15:24.662 --> 15:25.968
- No, it is a priority.

15:26.012 --> 15:30.668
- Actions--
that's all I'm saying.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.505
- Hey, Mo.
- What's up, Miss Angela?

15:41.549 --> 15:44.682
- I hate to ask, but...

15:44.726 --> 15:46.336
how you doing on leftovers?

15:46.380 --> 15:47.685
- Ah, damn.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.339
Don't tell me things
are that bad with your family.

15:49.383 --> 15:51.863
- No, we're good.
- You don't have to pretend.

15:51.907 --> 15:53.343
I heard they tore down
your project.

15:53.387 --> 15:56.172
- Yeah, now there's
a whole encampment set up--

15:56.216 --> 15:58.870
parents, I mean, kids, elders.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.698
- But you're okay?
- Yeah.

16:00.742 --> 16:02.309
I'm staying
with a family friend.

16:02.352 --> 16:03.614
- Well, thank God.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.181
You don't need your kids
on the street like that.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.357
- I wish I could do something,
you know?

16:07.401 --> 16:09.533
But I don't know what.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.709
Anyway, if you got any food
you could spare--

16:11.753 --> 16:13.015
- Hell, yeah,
I could spare some.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.800
Hey, look, you come back
tomorrow and the next day

16:15.844 --> 16:18.194
and the next until folks
are back on their feet.

16:18.238 --> 16:21.023
Okay?
- Mo, thank you so much.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.025
- All right,
don't go crying on me, now.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.897
Make my food all salty.

16:25.941 --> 16:27.899
- Come on.

16:37.039 --> 16:39.737
- You still want to help Yoli?
- You know I do.

16:39.781 --> 16:42.218
- Then I need you to find out
what her mother's hiding.

16:42.262 --> 16:43.480
- What are you talking about?

16:43.524 --> 16:45.874
- I got a good bullshit
detector, Derrick,

16:45.917 --> 16:47.745
in English and in Spanish,

16:47.789 --> 16:49.704
and I know
she's keeping something.

16:49.747 --> 16:52.228
And if it comes out in her
bond hearing, it's game over.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.361
- If she won't talk to you,
why would she talk to me?

16:54.404 --> 16:57.059
- She wouldn't...
but Yoli might.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.930
- You just said
her mother's the one lying.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.063
- I said
she was hiding something.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.978
I didn't say Yoli
wasn't aware of it.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.067
- Shit, why are you always
asking me to cross the line?

17:05.111 --> 17:07.548
- She trusts you, Derrick.

17:07.591 --> 17:11.291
It's the reason why
she came to you and not me.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.294
- Yeah, and you're asking me
to betray that trust.

17:14.337 --> 17:17.558
- I'm asking you to put
your reporter hat back on

17:17.601 --> 17:20.517
and get me something,
because if you don't,

17:20.561 --> 17:23.085
Yoli's clinic lawyer
is gonna get rolled in court

17:23.129 --> 17:24.956
and her mother's
gonna be deported.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.656
And I know you don't want that.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.440
- Way to guilt me out.

17:30.484 --> 17:33.095
- Hmm. It's the greatest
motivator in the world.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.448

Oh, I'm sorry.

Um, Mayor Mark Taylor,
this is Keri Allen--

18:28.585 --> 18:30.848
Bobby's right-hand girl.
- Ah, pleasure.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.850
- We prefer the term
City Attorney.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.156
- City Attorney?
- Yes.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.853
- Yeah, you must have
your hands full

18:35.897 --> 18:37.028
with Bobby over there.

18:37.072 --> 18:39.118
Intense motherfucker.

Chicago's take
on that health care initiative

18:49.215 --> 18:51.173
that gave Palo Alto
such a headache.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.870
- Yeah, well, come on,
you know Bobby's no stranger

18:52.914 --> 18:54.176
to headaches and neither am I.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.135
Plus, this one we are
really passionate about.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.658
- Yeah, I can see that.

18:57.701 --> 19:00.182
- It's not another
all-talk-no-action move.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.532
We think this one might
actually do some real good.

19:02.576 --> 19:04.882
- Listen, I'm with you.
We tried, too.

19:04.926 --> 19:06.884
We couldn't get around
all the legal crap

19:06.928 --> 19:08.364
that sunk the others.

19:08.408 --> 19:10.279
I'm curious--
what was your brilliant solve?

19:10.323 --> 19:12.063
- Well, we started--
- It wasn't rocket science.

19:12.107 --> 19:13.761
Actually, we just established
that it was not only

19:13.804 --> 19:16.067
constitutional in the language
of the measure,

19:16.111 --> 19:18.069
but we built in fines
for violators

19:18.113 --> 19:20.159
to fund city enforcement.

19:21.116 --> 19:22.900
- Well, I see why
Bobby appointed her.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.293
Anyone want a drink?

19:24.337 --> 19:26.469
- I'm fine.
- I could use another.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.950
- Ah, wait till tomorrow.
It only gets worse.

19:28.993 --> 19:31.692
- After you.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.737
- Thank you, sir.

19:49.971 --> 19:51.755
- Keri?

19:56.369 --> 19:58.240
- Yeah?

19:58.284 --> 19:59.807
- So handy.

19:59.850 --> 20:01.722
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to abandon you down there.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.202
- Oh, you didn't.
I wanted to come back

20:03.245 --> 20:05.247
and go over the speech,
especially since you added

20:05.291 --> 20:06.466
that part about San Jose.

20:06.509 --> 20:09.991
- Yeah,
I hope that's all right.

20:10.034 --> 20:11.732
- I agree with Mark.

20:11.775 --> 20:14.474
I see why Bobby hired you,
but since you did,

20:14.517 --> 20:17.738
do you mind helping me
make some changes?

20:17.781 --> 20:19.348
- It's his speech. I--

20:19.392 --> 20:22.830
- Well, now it's mine, and
I'd like to make some changes.

20:22.873 --> 20:24.658
- All right, do you mind
if I grab my wine?

20:24.701 --> 20:26.181
- No, not at all.

20:29.358 --> 20:31.534
- Would you like a glass?

20:31.578 --> 20:33.884
- Hmm?
- Of Chardonnay.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.799
There's a bottle in the room.

20:35.843 --> 20:38.976
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.285
- Do you not drink at all?

20:48.116 --> 20:50.161
I have MS.

20:50.205 --> 20:52.468
But you know that, right?

20:52.512 --> 20:54.862
Because it's hard to work
for someone for--

20:54.905 --> 20:57.125
what was it that you said--
two years?

20:57.168 --> 20:59.432
And not know everything
about them, right?

21:03.653 --> 21:06.830
- Okay, so much for the speech.

21:06.874 --> 21:08.441
This is why you came.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.965
- Give me a little more credit
than that.

21:11.008 --> 21:13.707
As the mayor's wife, I have
certain responsibilities,

21:13.750 --> 21:15.361
and this is one of them.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.887
- Can I ask how long
you've known?

21:19.930 --> 21:21.802
- You don't get
to ask me anything.

21:21.845 --> 21:24.326
- Okay, I'm gonna go back
to my room.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.806
- What's wrong with you?

21:25.849 --> 21:28.330
- I'm not doing this with you,
Mrs. Novak.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.593
- Please, stop calling me
Mrs. Novak, all right?

21:30.637 --> 21:34.075
It just adds to the perversity
of our situation.

21:35.119 --> 21:38.035
- I'm sorry.
I never wanted to hurt you.

21:38.079 --> 21:40.211
- I'm not looking
for your pity.

21:40.255 --> 21:43.171
- I'm not giving you pity.
It happened, and I'm sorry.

21:43.214 --> 21:45.478
And I don't--
I don't know what else to say.

21:45.521 --> 21:48.307
- You are a beautiful,
accomplished woman

21:48.350 --> 21:52.485
who has been with my husband
for five years.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.878
Not two...

21:54.922 --> 21:56.358
five.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.099
And in all that time,

21:58.142 --> 22:02.190
you have just let yourself
sit around and wait for scraps.

22:02.233 --> 22:04.627
You must think
pretty little of yourself

22:04.671 --> 22:06.194
to put up with that.

22:21.035 --> 22:24.386
- You found the one quiet spot
on the whole floor.

22:26.867 --> 22:29.043
What you working on?

22:29.086 --> 22:33.221
- Well, the best way
to bring my mother home

22:33.264 --> 22:35.658
is to show the judge

22:35.702 --> 22:38.400
that she has roots
in her community.

22:38.444 --> 22:41.185
So I am going to tell my story.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.840
- DACA.

22:43.884 --> 22:46.626
- Mm-hmm.
- That's brave of you.

22:46.669 --> 22:49.585
- Yeah, well, she's the one
that's locked up.

22:49.629 --> 22:52.719
I just need to get up there and
not make a fool out of myself.

22:52.762 --> 22:55.722
- Well, you know I do help
write speeches for a living.

22:55.765 --> 22:58.420
- Okay, flack.
Listen, I'm good.

22:58.464 --> 22:59.726
Thank you.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.249
- Well, you need to do
a little more

23:01.292 --> 23:03.251
than not make a fool
out of yourself.

23:03.294 --> 23:05.514
If you're gonna go
the whole DACA route,

23:05.558 --> 23:08.125
you need to be
100% accurate.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.999
- Why wouldn't I be?
- No, I'm just saying.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.522
I mean, look what they did
to your mother.

23:13.566 --> 23:16.090
She followed all the rules,
and they still locked her up.

23:16.133 --> 23:17.918
Just remember, when you're
reading that in court,

23:17.961 --> 23:19.049
you're under oath.

23:19.093 --> 23:21.791
I can't believe this.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.619
She put you up to this,
didn't she?

23:23.663 --> 23:25.926
- What?
What are you ta--

23:25.969 --> 23:27.884
- No, no, no, don't lie to me.
You can't come here

23:27.928 --> 23:30.974
accusing me and my family
of lying by lying to my face.

23:31.018 --> 23:33.629
- She's just trying
to help you.

23:33.673 --> 23:35.979
We both are.

23:36.023 --> 23:37.677
- My mom didn't do
anything wrong.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.593
- Yoli, come on.
Is it possible you don't know?

23:40.636 --> 23:42.638
- No, okay?

23:42.682 --> 23:44.640
Because my mom's
my best friend.

23:44.684 --> 23:46.468
And if she were hiding
something,

23:46.512 --> 23:48.818
I would be
the first one to know.

24:01.352 --> 24:03.833
- I'm assuming you're with
the Mayors' Conference.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.141
- Wow.

24:07.184 --> 24:09.186
I'll take that
as a "get away from me creep."

24:09.230 --> 24:11.711
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24:11.754 --> 24:14.278
That was mean.
I'm Keri.

24:14.322 --> 24:17.020
- Josh.
Comms Director, Denver.

24:17.064 --> 24:18.892
- City Attorney, Chicago.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.807
- Well, now that we've shown
each other our résumés,

24:20.850 --> 24:22.809
we could move on to SAT scores
if you want.

24:22.852 --> 24:24.811
- Or you could go back to

24:24.854 --> 24:27.030
your "stay the fuck away
from me" creep vibe.

24:27.074 --> 24:29.642
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24:29.685 --> 24:31.600
- I'm not usually
this much of a bitch.

24:31.644 --> 24:34.342
- Oh, sure you are.

24:34.385 --> 24:35.604
- Look, it's fine.

24:35.648 --> 24:37.171
I'm sure you get hit on
all the time.

24:37.214 --> 24:38.999
I'm sure
it gets pretty tiring.

24:39.042 --> 24:40.566
It's just, you know,
for me, um...

24:40.609 --> 24:43.046
I don't do the online thing,
I see you're not married,

24:43.090 --> 24:45.005
and I don't dare get involved
with any of the women

24:45.048 --> 24:46.789
I work with,
not these days, anyway.

24:46.833 --> 24:49.009
- Yeah, it's definitely
not a good idea.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.490
- So, when you meet someone
who's obviously like-minded,

24:51.533 --> 24:52.839
obviously smart,

24:52.882 --> 24:56.407
and obviously hot...

24:57.974 --> 25:00.368
You get where I'm going.

25:02.718 --> 25:05.373
- What was your name again?

25:05.416 --> 25:07.680
- It's Josh.

25:07.723 --> 25:10.683
- Josh...

25:10.726 --> 25:14.164
Comms Director,
Denver.

25:14.208 --> 25:16.471
Josh.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.870
Thank you.

25:30.877 --> 25:32.879
What's wrong with you?

25:32.922 --> 25:34.271
- It's late.

25:34.315 --> 25:35.882
I'm gonna close the door,
and I'm going to bed.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.536
- No, you asked me.
I want to ask you.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.059
What's wrong with you?

25:39.102 --> 25:40.713
- Okay, I think you've probably
had too much to drink.

25:40.756 --> 25:43.150
You don't want to say something
that you're going to regret.

25:43.193 --> 25:45.065
- I love your husband.
- Oh, God.

25:45.108 --> 25:46.806
- That's why I put up
with the scraps.

25:46.849 --> 25:48.590
- Okay.
- That's why.

25:48.634 --> 25:51.593
What's your excuse?
You've known for five years.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.029
You don't get much more
than I do,

25:53.073 --> 25:55.902
I mean, what happened to the
woman that I met downstairs,

25:55.945 --> 25:58.905
that perfect political wife,
greeting and gliding?

25:58.948 --> 26:01.516
What happened to her?
Where did she go?

26:01.560 --> 26:03.431
- She got sick.

26:03.474 --> 26:04.867
- Bullshit.

26:04.911 --> 26:07.783
You knew long before you got
sick, and you did nothing.

26:07.827 --> 26:09.611
You didn't say a word.
You just stayed.

26:09.655 --> 26:10.917
And you still stay.

26:10.960 --> 26:15.443
So where's your self-esteem,
Mrs. Novak?

26:30.589 --> 26:33.504
- Ms. Pearson.
Jessica.

26:33.548 --> 26:35.115
- Oh, so now it's Jessica?

26:35.158 --> 26:36.464
- Well, since I broke
the case open,

26:36.507 --> 26:37.944
I figure
I could take some liberties.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.293
- That depends
on what you got.

26:39.336 --> 26:41.034
- I believe Yoli when she says
her mom

26:41.077 --> 26:42.601
isn't hiding anything.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.646
Those two are close,
but it got me to thinking.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.256
What if what her mom is hiding

26:46.300 --> 26:48.302
happened before they even
got into this country?

26:48.345 --> 26:50.347
I got some dates
from Yoli's job application,

26:50.391 --> 26:53.437
and then I pulled this article
from the Reuter's archive.

26:56.049 --> 26:58.312
Look like anyone you know?

27:06.146 --> 27:08.191
- Stephanie?

27:10.454 --> 27:11.760
It's close to 11:00.

27:11.804 --> 27:15.111
They're asking
where you are downstairs.

27:15.155 --> 27:17.636
Is everything all right?

27:22.510 --> 27:25.295
- I can't do the speech, Keri.

27:25.339 --> 27:28.037
- You don't look very well.

27:28.081 --> 27:30.561
Um, can I get you some water?

27:30.605 --> 27:33.826
I'm gonna get you some water.

27:42.138 --> 27:44.663
Thank you.

27:45.794 --> 27:48.536
- I'm sorry about last night,
and I'm really sorry

27:48.579 --> 27:51.147
if what I said had anything
to do with this.

27:53.715 --> 27:56.457
This just happens sometimes,
all right?

27:56.500 --> 27:58.328
It's just part of the deal.

27:58.372 --> 28:01.418
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes.

28:01.462 --> 28:04.073
Don't tell anybody.

28:06.554 --> 28:09.513
- Why are you keeping this
to yourself?

28:09.557 --> 28:12.734
- Because Bobby asked me to.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.172
- I thought you were the one
that wanted it this way.

28:16.216 --> 28:18.653
- No, Bobby thinks
that if we went public,

28:18.697 --> 28:19.959
people would think

28:20.002 --> 28:23.397
that he couldn't possibly
focus on his job.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.573
- That's ridiculous.

28:25.616 --> 28:27.183
You shouldn't have to bear
the burden

28:27.227 --> 28:30.186
of keeping this to yourself--
that's not fair to you.

28:33.973 --> 28:36.323
- It doesn't matter.

28:36.366 --> 28:38.717
Okay?
He asked me, I promised,

28:38.760 --> 28:41.502
it's my job, and it is
none of your business.

28:44.157 --> 28:46.202
Oh, my God.

28:50.598 --> 28:53.732
What are you doing?

28:53.775 --> 28:56.212
- I'm sitting with you
until you feel better.

28:56.256 --> 28:58.737
- Okay, well,
it could be a while, all right?

28:58.780 --> 29:01.696
I might feel
like this all day, so...

29:01.740 --> 29:04.699
- Then I will wait
all day if I have to.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.484
- You're making that speech.

29:10.836 --> 29:15.014
You really hate
public speaking that much?

29:15.057 --> 29:17.103
- Drink your water.

29:17.146 --> 29:18.408
- Yes, ma'am.

29:22.586 --> 29:24.110
- Angela.
- Did you get my message?

29:24.153 --> 29:26.416
- No, I didn't. I've been
wrapped up in something.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.070
- I was at North Park
last night.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.464
There's at least
100 people living in tents.

29:30.507 --> 29:31.987
- I didn't know.
- Yeah, no one knows.

29:32.031 --> 29:33.684
That's the problem.
- I'm so sorry.

29:33.728 --> 29:35.077
Can I call you back later?

29:35.121 --> 29:37.079
I'm trying to keep
my assistant's mother

29:37.123 --> 29:38.211
from being deported.

29:38.254 --> 29:39.778
- So you have time
for your assistant

29:39.821 --> 29:40.909
but not your own family?

29:40.953 --> 29:42.911
- Of course I have time
for my family.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.521
It's why I'm letting you
stay with me.

29:44.565 --> 29:46.088
- "Letting"?
- That's not what I--

29:46.132 --> 29:48.264
- You know what?
It's okay. I got it.

29:48.308 --> 29:49.657
- Angela.

29:50.658 --> 29:52.660
Angela?

29:55.881 --> 29:59.754
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, it's nothing.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.930
- You forgot I know Steph.

30:01.974 --> 30:05.629
She's never late for anything.

30:05.673 --> 30:08.328
- You promise you'll keep it
to yourself?

30:08.371 --> 30:10.678
- Hmm.

30:12.332 --> 30:14.595
- Wardrobe malfunction.

30:14.638 --> 30:17.946
I kid you not.

30:17.990 --> 30:20.166
- Good afternoon.

30:20.209 --> 30:22.037
I'd now like to introduce

30:22.081 --> 30:24.387
the First Lady of Chicago,
Stephanie Novak,

30:24.431 --> 30:27.390
to speak about her city's
health care initiative.

30:27.434 --> 30:28.652
Stephanie.

30:35.877 --> 30:38.662
- Thank you.
People ask me all the time

30:38.706 --> 30:41.796
why my husband and I
are so passionate

30:41.840 --> 30:44.059
about the issue
of health care.

30:44.103 --> 30:48.411
They ask me, is it personal?
Is it political?

30:48.455 --> 30:50.849
The answer is simple.

30:50.892 --> 30:54.200
It is very personal.

31:02.295 --> 31:04.732
I have my health.

31:04.775 --> 31:06.865
I'm lucky.

31:06.908 --> 31:09.693
My family has their health.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.347
They're lucky.

31:11.391 --> 31:12.566
But for the millions who live

31:12.609 --> 31:15.656
in America's big cities today
who don't,

31:15.699 --> 31:18.311
we are not doing enough
for them.

31:26.972 --> 31:30.366
-  Dinner
will be served in 15 minutes.

31:43.640 --> 31:47.427
- I've prepared an affidavit
for you to sign.

31:50.212 --> 31:52.388
It's okay.

31:52.432 --> 31:55.217
I know everything.

31:55.261 --> 31:57.959
And now that I do,
I need you to sign this

31:58.003 --> 32:00.048
and testify to it
at your hearing.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.441
- I cannot.

32:01.484 --> 32:04.052
- Mrs. Castillo, this is
your only chance for asylum.

32:04.096 --> 32:06.228
Without asylum,
you will be deported.

32:06.272 --> 32:08.361
- I thought you said
they were looking for reasons

32:08.404 --> 32:09.928
to kick me out.

32:09.971 --> 32:12.408
I killed two people.
- Two gang members.

32:12.452 --> 32:15.194
- It's still murder.

32:17.979 --> 32:21.765
I raised Yoli
to do the right thing...

32:21.809 --> 32:25.117
always to do the right thing.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.075
They were children,
Ms. Pearson.

32:27.119 --> 32:29.948
The youngest one
didn't even shave.

32:29.991 --> 32:32.994
I saw his face
after I shot them.

32:34.430 --> 32:35.997
I'm no better than they are.

32:36.041 --> 32:40.132
- What happened to those boys
was done by the gangs.

32:40.175 --> 32:42.308
Not you.
- Yoli won't see it that way.

32:42.351 --> 32:44.788
- Your daughter
will understand what you did.

32:44.832 --> 32:48.183
She's a wonderful
and forgiving young woman.

32:48.227 --> 32:51.882
- Yes, but it changes
everything.

32:51.926 --> 32:53.972
I kept this from her, and...

32:54.015 --> 32:55.974
she'll never trust me again.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.714
- Of course she will.

32:57.758 --> 32:59.890
- She'll never see me
the same way.

32:59.934 --> 33:01.849
- You keep this from her,

33:01.892 --> 33:05.461
and she'll never see you
at all.

33:05.505 --> 33:07.768
Is that what you want?

33:07.811 --> 33:11.511
Please...sign it.

33:30.834 --> 33:33.446
- Going somewhere?

33:33.489 --> 33:35.491
Angela.
What happened?

33:35.535 --> 33:37.276
- I can't just sit up in here
and live like a queen

33:37.319 --> 33:38.712
while our friends
are on the streets.

33:38.755 --> 33:40.279
- Don't you think
it's killing me, too?

33:40.322 --> 33:41.671
But there's nothing we can do
about it.

33:41.715 --> 33:43.282
- Oh, God,
you sound like Jessica.

33:43.325 --> 33:45.110
Everybody's ready to throw
their hands up

33:45.153 --> 33:46.676
and forget about
the people we left behind.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.461
- Don't you dare
talk to me that way.

33:48.504 --> 33:50.985
Your cousin did everything
in her power

33:51.029 --> 33:52.334
to change the situation.

33:52.378 --> 33:53.901
- Well, I haven't done
everything in my power.

33:53.944 --> 33:54.989
- What does that mean?

33:55.033 --> 33:56.686
- It means I'm not
leaving them behind.

33:56.730 --> 33:59.863
- Living on the street homeless
is not gonna change anything.

33:59.907 --> 34:01.909
- No, but living right across
from City Hall might.

34:01.952 --> 34:03.650
- Angela, you have babies.

34:06.783 --> 34:09.612
- They may not understand
what I'm doing now.

34:09.656 --> 34:12.311
Hopefully someday they will.

34:12.354 --> 34:13.312
- Angela.

34:16.663 --> 34:17.620
Stop!

34:26.151 --> 34:28.240
- Derrick said
you were looking for me?

34:28.283 --> 34:29.850
- I was.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.504
Sit down, Yoli.

34:31.547 --> 34:33.114
- "Sit down" is never good.

34:33.158 --> 34:35.551
What's going on?

34:36.987 --> 34:39.164
Please just tell me.

34:40.687 --> 34:42.906
Your mother just signed
an affidavit asking for asylum.

34:42.950 --> 34:45.257
- She doesn't have a case
for asylum.

34:45.300 --> 34:47.520
- All I know
is what she's swearing to.

34:47.563 --> 34:50.871
- So she's lying.

34:50.914 --> 34:54.135
- Would you like me
to read her statement?

34:54.179 --> 34:56.529
"On March 17, 1994,

34:56.572 --> 34:58.705
"when my daughter
was two years old,

34:58.748 --> 35:03.013
"two young men broke into
our home in Guanajuato, Mexico.

35:03.057 --> 35:06.887
"Based on their distinctive
tattoos, I recognized them

35:06.930 --> 35:11.065
"as members of the violent
gang Mara Salvatrucha.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.154
"My husband was at work.

35:13.198 --> 35:16.462
"I was home alone,
and I had a baby.

35:16.505 --> 35:18.942
"I feared the worst.

35:18.986 --> 35:22.381
"So I picked up
my husband's shotgun...

35:22.424 --> 35:26.211
"and I shot both boys.

35:26.254 --> 35:27.908
"Fearing payback from the gang,

35:27.951 --> 35:31.825
"my husband and I took our
daughter and fled to America.

35:31.868 --> 35:35.655
If I am sent back"--
- Okay, stop, stop, stop.

35:35.698 --> 35:39.572
- Yoli...
- No, I-I don't believe it.

35:39.615 --> 35:42.357
No.
- I know it's hard to hear.

35:42.401 --> 35:44.620
- No, there's no way.

35:44.664 --> 35:47.319
- Like you said,
your mother doesn't lie.

35:47.362 --> 35:50.235
- No, it's all--that's a lie.

35:54.456 --> 35:57.111
How could she not tell me?

35:57.155 --> 35:58.634
My whole life?

35:58.678 --> 36:01.594
- This is exactly
what she was afraid of.

36:01.637 --> 36:05.511
She was willing to leave
the country...

36:05.554 --> 36:09.123
instead of shattering the image
you have of her.

36:13.910 --> 36:16.696
- This can't guarantee
her asylum.

36:16.739 --> 36:20.047
This could get her deported.

36:20.090 --> 36:25.052
- She told the truth.
That's all she can do.

36:25.095 --> 36:27.881
That's all any of us can do.

36:37.673 --> 36:39.806
I want to see her.

36:39.849 --> 36:42.852
Can I see her?
- No, it's too late.

36:42.896 --> 36:45.551
Visiting hours are--
- Yeah, I know, over by 8:00.

36:45.594 --> 36:48.249
I hate that place.

36:50.817 --> 36:53.820
Thanks, Jessica.

36:54.864 --> 36:57.911
- I guess everyone's
calling me Jessica now.

37:07.834 --> 37:10.706
- I know, bud,
but you know the drill, right?

37:10.750 --> 37:13.666
Homework first, then TV.

37:13.709 --> 37:16.712
Okay, well, I'm on the way,
and Daddy will be home soon.

37:20.455 --> 37:23.545
Okay, sweetie.
I love you.

37:23.589 --> 37:25.460
- Here you go, ma'am.

37:25.504 --> 37:27.506
Oh. Thank you.

37:27.549 --> 37:29.551
It's only a recommendation.

37:29.595 --> 37:31.510
I mean, most of the literature
says they don't know

37:31.553 --> 37:33.990
either way, so...

37:36.079 --> 37:37.951
Mmm.

37:46.394 --> 37:48.309
I want to thank you, Keri.

37:48.353 --> 37:50.224
- For what?

37:50.268 --> 37:51.878
- For getting me
out of the house,

37:51.921 --> 37:55.055
for lighting a fire
under my ass.

37:56.752 --> 37:58.101
- Is this the part
where you tell me

37:58.145 --> 38:00.060
to stay the hell away
from your husband?

38:00.103 --> 38:01.888
No.

38:01.931 --> 38:05.848
I mean, I think a part of me
did come here to say that...

38:05.892 --> 38:09.243
and just to get
a good look at you.

38:09.287 --> 38:12.551
This isn't about my husband.
This is about me.

38:12.594 --> 38:14.901
I've been letting this disease
and you define me

38:14.944 --> 38:17.469
for far too long,
and I think I'm done with that.

38:17.512 --> 38:19.384
- You can't possibly say
that you don't care.

38:19.427 --> 38:20.689
- Oh, I care.

38:20.733 --> 38:23.388
It's just,
what can I do about it, Keri?

38:23.431 --> 38:25.651
I can't cure an addict.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.482
- I tried to end it
five years ago.

38:30.525 --> 38:31.787
I swear to God I did,

38:31.831 --> 38:34.094
but I see your husband
every day.

38:34.137 --> 38:36.357
We're around each other
all the time.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.925
- That's your choice.
- I don't want another job.

38:38.968 --> 38:42.755
I like what I do.
- Like I said...

38:42.798 --> 38:44.713
that's your choice.

38:45.845 --> 38:49.283
- So where do we go from here?

38:53.896 --> 38:55.420
- Home.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.850
- It's Nick.
I can't take your call.

39:34.894 --> 39:37.984
Leave one for me.
