00:01.705 --> 00:03.215
Your phone's ringing!

00:03.235 --> 00:05.763
Sorry. Just ignore it.
It's... it's the girl.

00:06.865 --> 00:08.492
<i>Previously on "mistresses"...</i>

00:11.080 --> 00:12.891
I am in love with you,

00:12.911 --> 00:14.745
and I think you should
move in with me.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.507
Savi:
I accepted an offer.

00:16.527 --> 00:18.720
- You sure about this?
- No.

00:18.740 --> 00:21.413
What were you getting from Zack
that you couldn't get from me?!

00:21.433 --> 00:22.661
I don't know.

00:22.681 --> 00:25.011
You need to figure that out.
Let's call it a break.

00:25.031 --> 00:26.339
I'm here to apologize.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.629
- For being married?!
- And I love you.

00:28.649 --> 00:30.231
I just need to be with you right now.

00:30.251 --> 00:31.776
Hey, hey.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:42.747 --> 00:44.978
Hey.

00:46.532 --> 00:48.366
You couldn't sleep?

00:49.582 --> 00:51.493
When you're with me...

00:52.076 --> 00:54.487
Where does she think you are...
your wife?

00:54.918 --> 00:57.164
Never mind.
I don't even want to know.

00:59.655 --> 01:00.827
The marriage is over, April.

01:00.862 --> 01:02.869
- We're not even...
- Stop.

01:05.078 --> 01:07.274
- W-what? You're leaving?
- I have to!

01:08.180 --> 01:10.503
S-so this is goodbye?!

01:14.213 --> 01:16.208
You made me love you.

01:16.831 --> 01:18.350
You made me need you!

01:18.370 --> 01:20.212
Well, I need you, too.

01:20.452 --> 01:23.182
Hey, April, I love you so much.

01:23.529 --> 01:25.551
Can't you feel that?

01:28.692 --> 01:30.255
I'll call you.

01:31.950 --> 01:32.950
No.

01:33.476 --> 01:35.114
I'll call you.

01:37.149 --> 01:39.085
April, I'm sorry!

01:40.401 --> 01:41.781
Just... just...

01:42.525 --> 01:44.349
Just tell me you'll be back.

01:46.298 --> 01:48.140
I don't know.

02:01.552 --> 02:04.327
So, you had no idea
the woman Jacob's been seeing

02:04.347 --> 02:05.568
is your patient?

02:05.588 --> 02:06.859
None whatsoever,

02:06.879 --> 02:09.316
and I'm the reason Jacob
broke things off with her.

02:09.336 --> 02:10.662
If Anna ever
found that out, I...

02:10.697 --> 02:13.225
Okay, let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

02:13.846 --> 02:15.886
Have you said anything
about this to Jacob?

02:15.906 --> 02:17.015
Of course not.

02:17.035 --> 02:18.884
Oh, good.

02:20.063 --> 02:22.673
- I don't need that.
- No, this is for me.

02:23.347 --> 02:25.519
Now, what about Jacob?

02:25.539 --> 02:27.603
Do you plan to keep seeing him
romantically?

02:29.427 --> 02:31.782
It's more
than just attraction with him.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.197
It feels right.
He knows me.

02:34.217 --> 02:36.729
The good, the bad, the ugly,
the awful, and he...

02:37.774 --> 02:41.154
...he still wants me, maybe all
the more because of it.

02:41.551 --> 02:43.090
I don't want to lose him.

02:43.512 --> 02:45.242
Then you have to stop
seeing Anna.

02:45.262 --> 02:47.497
She needs me.
She has no one else.

02:47.531 --> 02:49.424
She's made a connection with me.

02:49.444 --> 02:51.317
She's young
and vulnerable and...

02:51.337 --> 02:53.470
And very much like Sam.

02:55.643 --> 02:58.931
And you think this is a chance
to do things right.

02:59.490 --> 03:01.542
This is a troubled girl, Irving.

03:01.562 --> 03:02.671
Stopping her treatment

03:02.691 --> 03:05.383
while she's dealing
with Jacob's rejection,

03:05.403 --> 03:07.753
she may become suicidal again.

03:07.773 --> 03:08.857
And she may not.

03:08.877 --> 03:10.446
Is that supposed to be helpful?!

03:10.466 --> 03:11.818
Look...

03:12.836 --> 03:16.104
Anna may react badly
to having to switch doctors,

03:16.124 --> 03:18.740
but you may slip
into a depression again

03:18.760 --> 03:20.961
if you lose
the first shot you've had

03:20.981 --> 03:24.901
at an appropriate relationship
in a very long time.

03:25.502 --> 03:28.654
Just think about that
before you do anything rash.

03:35.650 --> 03:36.884
Good morning.

03:36.904 --> 03:38.169
Morning.

03:44.664 --> 03:45.664
What?

03:45.688 --> 03:46.889
Nothing.

03:47.072 --> 03:49.943
Well, it's none of my business,
but are you okay?

03:49.963 --> 03:50.993
Yeah.

03:51.403 --> 03:54.496
Fine. I'm totally, you know,
just... Fine.

03:56.190 --> 03:57.190
What is that for?

03:57.210 --> 03:58.662
In case you cry.

04:00.672 --> 04:03.948
I know you and I
got off on the wrong foot.

04:04.581 --> 04:06.385
But we're more alike
than you think.

04:06.405 --> 04:08.911
We're ambitious.
We're attractive.

04:08.945 --> 04:10.540
We're working in a man's world.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.483
And speaking of which,
I'd really like

04:12.503 --> 04:14.250
to just concentrate
on the work here, so...

04:14.270 --> 04:16.012
I'm in awe of you, really.

04:16.031 --> 04:18.269
I was looking through
some of your old cases.

04:18.290 --> 04:21.336
If you ask me, you should have
made partner by now.

04:21.529 --> 04:22.775
Why haven't you, though?

04:22.795 --> 04:24.078
As far as I understand it,

04:24.098 --> 04:27.163
your and Dom's affair
was well-known last year.

04:27.374 --> 04:29.267
But Dom still got a promotion.

04:29.287 --> 04:30.893
Seems unfair.

04:30.913 --> 04:32.352
Look...

04:32.923 --> 04:36.175
I know we've had
our differences, Savi, but...

04:36.634 --> 04:38.326
We shouldn't be enemies.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.072
We should be helping each other.

04:40.092 --> 04:42.500
Maybe one day,
we could even be friends.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.257
Okay, two things.

04:47.277 --> 04:50.165
One, get your ass
off my case files.

04:50.413 --> 04:51.138
Thank you.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.684
And two,
in order to be my friend,

04:52.704 --> 04:56.134
I actually have to trust you,
and I will never...

04:56.593 --> 04:58.641
ever trust you.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.282
Excuse me.
It's my real-estate agent.

05:03.302 --> 05:04.680
Hello?

05:06.330 --> 05:07.330
What?!

05:07.795 --> 05:09.470
Okay. All right.

05:10.897 --> 05:12.172
Bye.

05:19.968 --> 05:21.447
Hey, uh,
now that we're gonna be roomies,

05:21.482 --> 05:24.944
do you think that my lady shoes
can live with your lady shoes?

05:24.964 --> 05:27.153
Yeah, you know, I mean,
as long as you think they're ready

05:27.173 --> 05:29.114
- for that kind of commitment, sure.
- Yeah.

05:29.134 --> 05:30.429
Well, then we're gonna have to move

05:30.449 --> 05:31.890
some of these puppies
out of here, right?

05:31.910 --> 05:34.422
Like, what? WNBA?

05:34.695 --> 05:35.849
I... yeah.

05:36.097 --> 05:38.224
Worst night of my life...
don't want to talk about it.

05:38.244 --> 05:39.912
Tell you what... why don't we
just take every pair of shoes

05:39.932 --> 05:42.001
that's not your size and, um...

05:42.035 --> 05:43.876
You know, just get rid of 'em?
We'll Chuck 'em?

05:45.004 --> 05:47.226
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:48.243 --> 05:49.842
Although...

05:50.015 --> 05:51.015
What?

05:51.035 --> 05:52.344
Well, it's...

05:52.656 --> 05:53.656
You know what?
It's stupid.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.180
Don't worry about it.
It's stupid.

05:55.478 --> 05:56.559
Oh, Scott,
come on. Tell me.

05:58.444 --> 06:00.084
Okay, uh...

06:01.063 --> 06:03.521
It's just, yesterday,
I told you that I loved you,

06:04.008 --> 06:07.110
and you responded by making
an epic three-pointer.

06:07.259 --> 06:09.014
Yes, you did say it, didn't you?

06:09.034 --> 06:10.578
- Yeah.
- And I didn't say anything.

06:10.598 --> 06:12.363
- No.
- Then I... because, you know, it just...

06:12.397 --> 06:14.849
it happened so fast,
a-and I-I was...

06:14.869 --> 06:17.021
I didn't know what to say,
and I panicked, and I'm sorry.

06:17.041 --> 06:19.416
- I'm a jerk.
- No, you're not a jerk.

06:19.436 --> 06:21.653
No, no, no, Scott,
I am because...

06:22.650 --> 06:23.816
I do.

06:24.740 --> 06:26.710
You do what?

06:27.086 --> 06:29.307
Share your feelings.

06:30.759 --> 06:32.015
Oh.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.532
What feelings?

06:35.660 --> 06:38.134
The good ones.
The... the... the nice ones.

06:38.154 --> 06:41.191
- The... fuzzy ones.
- Okay.

06:43.888 --> 06:45.813
Baby, why don't you just say it?

06:52.149 --> 06:54.070
I love you, too.

06:57.439 --> 06:58.574
Are you gonna pass out?

07:00.078 --> 07:02.411
- No.
- Good.

07:02.445 --> 07:04.803
Why don't you finish unpacking?
I want to take you somewhere.

07:04.823 --> 07:06.225
Where?

07:06.245 --> 07:08.147
No place special, just...

07:08.167 --> 07:09.978
Somewhere
that'll change your life.

07:24.723 --> 07:26.428
Guess what I got us
for next Tuesday.

07:26.448 --> 07:27.857
Two tickets for Trois Mec.

07:27.877 --> 07:30.153
Not reservations, mind you...
tickets.

07:30.173 --> 07:32.840
It's not a meal, apparently.
It's an event.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.420
Hey.

07:38.273 --> 07:39.439
You okay?

07:46.326 --> 07:48.778
I don't even know
how to say this.

07:53.084 --> 07:55.331
So I'm just gonna say it.

07:55.815 --> 07:57.949
We can't see each other anymore.

08:00.363 --> 08:01.783
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:01.803 --> 08:04.346
What...
What are you talking about?

08:05.438 --> 08:06.759
I'm so sorry. I...

08:06.779 --> 08:08.206
Why?

08:09.683 --> 08:13.813
My therapist said it's too soon
for me to start dating again.

08:15.911 --> 08:16.983
But...

08:17.655 --> 08:19.752
But you told me
you have been dating.

08:20.373 --> 08:23.656
Yes, but I hadn't shared that
with my therapist.

08:24.567 --> 08:26.396
But you've
shared it with him now?

08:26.416 --> 08:28.294
Yes, because of you.

08:29.220 --> 08:32.698
Because you're significant to me
in a way others weren't.

08:34.283 --> 08:36.802
And because I have
deep feelings for you.

08:37.025 --> 08:39.296
And because we have
a friendship and history,

08:39.316 --> 08:41.649
it accelerates things.

08:42.741 --> 08:45.596
Well, I hope you don't feel like
I-I was pressuring you.

08:45.744 --> 08:47.457
You weren't.

08:48.313 --> 08:50.338
Do you want to
take things slower?

08:54.037 --> 08:56.321
I want things to stop.

09:01.035 --> 09:03.076
My therapist said...

09:03.236 --> 09:05.338
I shouldn't have started dating
for a year. I...

09:05.358 --> 09:07.331
Yeah, I got that part.

09:11.948 --> 09:14.050
You asked me out, Karen.

09:14.070 --> 09:16.420
- Jacob, I...
- You made me end things

09:16.440 --> 09:18.642
with the other girl I was seeing
for what?

09:20.572 --> 09:21.898
Doesn't matter.

09:22.618 --> 09:24.194
Do me a favor.

09:24.429 --> 09:27.048
When your year is up...
Don't call me.

09:46.028 --> 09:47.822
So, what do you think?

09:47.842 --> 09:50.366
Oh, my God!

09:50.683 --> 09:52.028
What do I think?

09:52.048 --> 09:53.815
Uh, I think you've been leading
a double life.

09:53.835 --> 09:55.520
How could you not tell me
that you own a restaurant?

09:55.540 --> 09:56.774
Well, 10% own anyway.

09:56.794 --> 09:59.082
- When does this place open?
- Middle of next month.

09:59.102 --> 10:01.358
- And you own this with...
- My friend Greta.

10:01.378 --> 10:02.875
Scott!

10:03.239 --> 10:05.249
Willkommen!

10:05.269 --> 10:06.361
That's Greta.

10:06.381 --> 10:07.780
I'll be right down.

10:08.086 --> 10:09.382
You're friends
with Greta Jager?!

10:09.416 --> 10:10.750
- Yeah.
- Swimsuit model Greta Jager?

10:10.784 --> 10:12.617
Oh, my God. I'm so turned on
by you right now.

10:12.651 --> 10:13.906
Hello, handsome.

10:13.926 --> 10:15.779
- How are you?
- Mwah! Mwah!

10:15.799 --> 10:18.205
- This is my girlfriend, Joss.
- Pleasure.

10:18.738 --> 10:20.513
I've heard so much about you.

10:20.533 --> 10:21.742
Yeah, I was just telling her
that we're looking

10:21.762 --> 10:23.119
for an event planner
to do the opening.

10:23.139 --> 10:24.896
What? No, you weren't.
I was going to.

10:24.930 --> 10:27.467
I want big and splashy.

10:27.487 --> 10:29.401
I do big and splashy.

10:29.435 --> 10:30.884
Uh, Harry leaves next week,
though.

10:30.904 --> 10:32.373
Well, that's the beauty of it.
He won't need him.

10:32.393 --> 10:33.833
This place already has
a chef, right?

10:33.838 --> 10:35.608
- Dieter Krause.
- Peter Krause?

10:35.628 --> 10:38.009
No, uh,
Dieter with a "D."

10:38.043 --> 10:39.176
If the opening goes well,

10:39.211 --> 10:41.012
we keep you on
as our in-house planner.

10:41.046 --> 10:43.414
Oh! What can I say?

10:43.812 --> 10:46.417
Say you will taste some food
and tell me your ideas.

10:47.224 --> 10:49.586
Feed me, Dieter Krause!

10:49.621 --> 10:51.422
Wunderbar!

10:54.958 --> 10:56.726
Sorry to pull you out of work like that,

10:56.760 --> 10:58.895
but the buyer's requesting
to speed up escrow.

10:58.930 --> 11:01.159
We could close
by the end of the week.

11:01.179 --> 11:03.333
Wait,
b-by the end of this week?

11:03.367 --> 11:04.741
Well, I know
Harry's moving soon,

11:04.761 --> 11:06.903
so I drew up the paperwork
just in case.

11:06.923 --> 11:09.357
Oh, obviously,
this would be good for me,

11:09.377 --> 11:11.408
but it's...
It's up to Savi.

11:11.442 --> 11:12.521
I don't want to...

11:12.541 --> 11:14.482
push you out
before you're ready.

11:17.581 --> 11:20.050
Y-you know what?
Let's just do it.

11:20.281 --> 11:22.986
Joss is about to move
out of the house, and...

11:23.160 --> 11:25.254
it's just starting to feel
less and less like home,

11:25.288 --> 11:28.836
so let's not drag this out.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.318
Just sign
where the stickies are.

11:30.338 --> 11:31.393
Okay.

11:33.292 --> 11:35.753
Hey, w-why is the buyer
suddenly in such a rush?

11:35.773 --> 11:38.583
Oh, he wants to remodel
the kitchen before move-in.

11:38.603 --> 11:40.635
The kitchen?!
Is he crazy?!

11:40.670 --> 11:41.789
It's the best room in the house.

11:41.809 --> 11:43.772
Yeah, does he realize
that a four-star chef

11:43.806 --> 11:45.393
actually designed this kitchen?

11:45.413 --> 11:46.708
I wouldn't change a thing,

11:46.742 --> 11:48.706
but, you know,
there's no accounting for taste.

11:48.726 --> 11:49.905
Well...

11:49.925 --> 11:51.424
Oh, Savi, before I forget,

11:51.444 --> 11:52.880
I have a condo
to show you tomorrow.

11:52.914 --> 11:54.208
How's 1:00?

11:54.228 --> 11:56.628
Uh, yes,
1:00 will be fine.

11:56.648 --> 11:57.926
Great.

12:00.011 --> 12:01.889
Oh, you missed one.

12:28.584 --> 12:29.912
<i>Hey, sorry we missed each other.</i>

12:29.932 --> 12:31.752
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

12:31.934 --> 12:34.087
Hi, Anna. It's Dr. Kim.

12:34.428 --> 12:35.855
Um...

12:36.339 --> 12:39.106
It's half past, and we have
an appointment today.

12:39.813 --> 12:42.963
Okay, I'm still here
if you're on your way.

12:43.313 --> 12:44.941
Call me anytime.

12:55.370 --> 12:58.026
I finished my homework.
Can I sleep at Peyton's tonight?

12:58.249 --> 12:59.249
No way!

12:59.279 --> 13:01.084
We're having gift bags
tomorrow?!

13:01.104 --> 13:02.749
You can't have
a nail-art birthday party

13:02.783 --> 13:04.751
without manicure sets.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.520
You found the sparkly stickers?!

13:07.554 --> 13:09.688
And I got extras just for you.

13:10.068 --> 13:13.108
This is gonna be the best
birthday party ever.

13:14.572 --> 13:17.228
Do you think Daniel's gonna
let me paint his nails?

13:17.810 --> 13:20.566
I thought you just wanted it
to be all girls.

13:20.813 --> 13:23.457
Daniel doesn't count.
He has to come.

13:23.618 --> 13:25.703
The nail-art party
was his idea.

13:26.162 --> 13:28.373
I know, but...

13:30.989 --> 13:34.645
I didn't want to have to tell
you this before your birthday...

13:35.730 --> 13:38.316
But Daniel and I broke up.

13:38.527 --> 13:39.884
When? Why?

13:40.276 --> 13:43.639
Sweetie,
it's... hard to explain.

13:43.855 --> 13:46.407
So, did he break up with you?

13:47.519 --> 13:48.693
It's complicated.

13:48.727 --> 13:50.386
What's complicated?

13:50.406 --> 13:52.458
You love each other, don't you?

13:53.277 --> 13:56.484
I mean you're, like,
glowing when he's around.

13:56.504 --> 13:58.747
You're so perfect together.

13:58.933 --> 14:01.606
And I thought
we all might be a family.

14:03.628 --> 14:05.498
I know. I know.

14:07.111 --> 14:08.545
Don't give up on him, mom.

14:18.198 --> 14:20.351
She... loved you.

14:20.371 --> 14:21.401
Really?
How can you tell?

14:21.421 --> 14:23.728
Are you kidding? She was
guffawing over all your jokes.

14:23.762 --> 14:25.327
You actually got that woman
to look unattractive.

14:25.347 --> 14:26.896
No, no, I didn't.

14:26.931 --> 14:28.898
Yeah, she's really beautiful,
isn't she? It's weird.

14:28.933 --> 14:31.235
Yeah, you know, there's just
this... there's just one thing.

14:31.269 --> 14:32.717
She's got mannish calves, right?

14:32.737 --> 14:34.168
- Is that what you were gonna say?
- No, no, no, Scott.

14:34.188 --> 14:36.000
Scott, the food's kind of terrible.

14:36.020 --> 14:37.541
- What?
- It's boring.

14:37.575 --> 14:39.686
What... what was that...
bacon-wrapped figs? Please!

14:39.810 --> 14:41.424
Aoc's been porking up
all kinds of fruit

14:41.444 --> 14:43.107
since before
the Terminator was mayor.

14:43.127 --> 14:44.615
- Governor.
- Whatever!

14:44.649 --> 14:47.150
Yeah, so chef Dieter's
not that inspired.

14:47.184 --> 14:50.153
Scott, "not that inspired"
doesn't work in this city.

14:50.187 --> 14:52.136
Harry's a million times
better chef than Dieter,

14:52.156 --> 14:53.972
and his restaurant failed.

14:54.171 --> 14:57.559
Tell me this... would you come back to
a restaurant with that kind of food?

14:58.462 --> 14:59.762
Bam, there's your answer.

14:59.796 --> 15:01.164
Honey, you've got to tell her.

15:01.198 --> 15:02.365
I've... I'm not
telling her anything.

15:02.399 --> 15:03.633
This restaurant's her baby.

15:03.667 --> 15:05.635
Her baby's ugly, honey,
and somebody's got to tell her,

15:05.669 --> 15:07.998
or else it's gonna get crucified
on its first day of school.

15:08.018 --> 15:09.338
Yeah, look,
I am a silent investor,

15:09.373 --> 15:10.839
so I'm not gonna say a word,
and I suggest

15:10.874 --> 15:13.408
if you want this job,
you shouldn't say a word either,

15:13.442 --> 15:14.676
okay?

15:14.879 --> 15:16.070
Fine.

15:17.770 --> 15:18.770
Let's go.

15:35.310 --> 15:36.831
I missed you.

15:38.139 --> 15:40.034
I missed you, too.

16:02.581 --> 16:05.097
It's everything
you've been asking for...

16:05.117 --> 16:06.897
less upkeep, more security.

16:06.917 --> 16:09.160
There's even a pool
with cabanas on the roof.

16:09.180 --> 16:10.309
Cabanas!

16:10.329 --> 16:11.674
Oh, just what I need.

16:13.585 --> 16:15.615
Oh, just a second.
Keep looking.

16:15.635 --> 16:17.141
Talk to me.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.410
You hate it, don't you?

16:21.430 --> 16:24.525
No, I mean I guess it's fine.

16:24.545 --> 16:27.738
Well, then why do you keep looking
like you want to jump out that window?

16:27.772 --> 16:29.482
It's just not what I pictured.

16:29.502 --> 16:31.356
I thought I'd be
moving in with Dom.

16:31.376 --> 16:32.770
Honey, that could still happen.

16:32.790 --> 16:34.778
Your relationship's
just on pause.

16:34.813 --> 16:36.288
What if he meets someone else?

16:36.308 --> 16:37.194
Oh, Savi!

16:37.214 --> 16:39.532
- What?
- Dom loves you.

16:39.552 --> 16:41.389
And you know that I am not
the biggest fan of his,

16:41.409 --> 16:42.965
but he's way too smart
to let you go.

16:42.985 --> 16:46.215
He's just... he's hurt.
Give him some time.

16:47.680 --> 16:51.576
You know, we could
move in here together.

16:51.837 --> 16:54.197
Didn't you just move in
with Scott?

16:54.232 --> 16:56.931
I just... I-I don't
want to leave you alone.

16:56.951 --> 16:59.371
Okay, I'm not 80.
I can live on my own.

16:59.391 --> 17:01.084
Oh, I know.

17:01.319 --> 17:04.396
Just, you took care of me,
so I want to take care of you.

17:05.563 --> 17:08.258
You've paid your dues
in that respect.

17:08.278 --> 17:09.300
Hmm?

17:09.319 --> 17:12.048
The whole recovery and...

17:12.082 --> 17:15.803
...everything after, and, yes,
you were right about Zack.

17:16.012 --> 17:17.374
And I should have listened to you.

17:17.424 --> 17:19.683
Yeah, well, I'm so rarely right

17:19.703 --> 17:21.891
that I'm not surprised
you didn't.

17:22.698 --> 17:24.260
I'm sorry.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.838
Don't be.

17:26.096 --> 17:28.422
- Can we hug now, please?
- Yes.

17:29.204 --> 17:30.666
Come here.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.021
Mm.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.324
- Wow, this place is white.
- It really is just white.

17:37.344 --> 17:38.975
It's like a bathroom.
Let's get out of here.

17:39.009 --> 17:40.550
Yes.

17:42.916 --> 17:45.137
Yes, she was admitted
to the hospital two months ago.

17:45.157 --> 17:49.220
Her name is Anna Choi...
C-H-O-I.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.288
Did she leave any other number
than her mobile?

17:52.496 --> 17:54.256
What about an address?

17:55.196 --> 17:57.793
Well, you must have it there.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.928
Sorry, Mary, I-I have to go.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.424
Hello? Anna?

18:07.931 --> 18:09.204
Are you there?

18:09.780 --> 18:12.324
A-Anna,
can you hear me?

18:13.659 --> 18:15.454
Are you okay?

18:16.608 --> 18:18.097
Anna?!

18:24.773 --> 18:26.730
Greta:
Mm! Love this.

18:26.750 --> 18:29.024
- Mm.
- Love this.

18:29.845 --> 18:32.393
I want you to do this
for the opening.

18:33.015 --> 18:34.015
Wait, does this mean...

18:34.035 --> 18:36.564
You got the job!
You're in!

18:36.598 --> 18:37.820
Oh, I'm "een"!

18:37.840 --> 18:40.035
- Great!
- Welcome to the team.

18:40.069 --> 18:42.369
Let's have chef Dieter
make you something to celebrate.

18:42.403 --> 18:43.590
Oh, no, no, I couldn't.
I'm... I'm...

18:43.610 --> 18:44.806
I insist.

18:44.826 --> 18:46.221
Okay. You know what?

18:46.241 --> 18:47.340
Actually, Greta,
I wanted to ask you,

18:47.360 --> 18:50.110
what are some of your favorite
dishes that he does?

18:51.559 --> 18:53.594
The stuffed artichokes...

18:53.614 --> 18:56.238
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and the, um...

18:56.647 --> 18:58.125
Hmm.

18:58.145 --> 18:59.987
Funny, that's all I've tried.

19:00.185 --> 19:02.692
I've been vegan and gluten-free
for the past 18 months,

19:02.712 --> 19:05.392
but everyone else
loves the food.

19:05.426 --> 19:06.894
Oh. Uh, is...
is that what they say?

19:06.928 --> 19:08.262
Oh, yes.

19:08.296 --> 19:10.624
Dieter is one
of my oldest friends.

19:13.647 --> 19:16.891
Oh! I am telling you, this guy's
food sucks the big suck.

19:16.911 --> 19:18.451
All right, can you just,
uh, scooch?

19:18.471 --> 19:20.399
I'm trying to garnish.
Oh, and ready for crazy?

19:20.419 --> 19:22.375
Greta hasn't even tried
most of it!

19:23.234 --> 19:24.234
What are these?

19:24.254 --> 19:26.545
They're blindfolds for the guys.
It's a bris.

19:28.115 --> 19:30.611
Hey, are you listening to me?!
Dieter's a dud!

19:30.631 --> 19:31.827
So?

19:31.847 --> 19:34.309
"So?" Harry,
I need this place to succeed.

19:34.329 --> 19:36.324
I haven't been working
my ass off to be a part

19:36.344 --> 19:38.355
of a restaurant vanity project
that's gonna fail.

19:38.375 --> 19:40.650
- I have a reputation to protect.
- Mm-hmm.

19:40.910 --> 19:44.508
And it just so happens that it's
an incredible opportunity for you.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.424
For me? Why? What?
What are you talking about?

19:47.444 --> 19:50.657
This place could be huge
with the right chef.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.304
Harry Davis.

19:53.095 --> 19:55.267
Oh, yeah.
Except wait a minute.

19:55.287 --> 19:57.376
You're forgetting, uh,
I'm moving back to Australia.

19:57.410 --> 19:59.213
I know, but let's just pretend
that you weren't.

19:59.233 --> 20:01.149
Listen, Harry, all we would
have to do is let Greta

20:01.169 --> 20:02.781
- and her people taste your food, and...
- No!

20:02.815 --> 20:04.630
- Just hear me out.
- I'm not interested, Joss.

20:04.650 --> 20:05.950
- Hmph!
- Okay, I've got a plane ticket,

20:05.984 --> 20:09.129
I've got a job lined up,
and my family is expecting me.

20:09.149 --> 20:11.921
Thank you for thinking of me,
though. I do appreciate it.

20:11.941 --> 20:13.331
Now pass me those tongs.

20:13.351 --> 20:14.783
Hmm.
- Chop-chop.

20:14.803 --> 20:16.210
"Chop-chop."

20:16.230 --> 20:17.550
Merci.

20:31.376 --> 20:32.679
Cute party, April.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.005
The girls
are having a great time.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.668
I'm glad
you were able to make it.

20:36.688 --> 20:39.850
Are you being fake nice,
or have you finally forgiven me?

20:40.353 --> 20:43.344
Let's just say I'm over it.

20:43.364 --> 20:46.500
Well, look who's becoming
more flexible.

20:50.223 --> 20:53.123
- Oh, would you excuse me a second?
- Sure.

20:55.443 --> 20:57.466
Hey! You look...

20:57.486 --> 21:00.103
A wreck? I know.
I didn't sleep last night.

21:00.137 --> 21:01.065
What's wrong?

21:01.085 --> 21:04.353
Critical patient of mine
has been missing for 24 hours.

21:04.373 --> 21:06.103
Oh, my God.
What can you do?

21:06.123 --> 21:08.586
Nothing.
I can't do anything.

21:08.606 --> 21:10.535
God, I hate my job.

21:10.671 --> 21:12.930
God. I'm sorry.

21:14.754 --> 21:16.491
How are you holding up?

21:16.702 --> 21:19.896
Oh.
You know, I'm fine.

21:20.417 --> 21:21.992
Did you talk to Daniel?

21:22.936 --> 21:24.394
No.

21:24.736 --> 21:26.796
How did you leave things?

21:27.131 --> 21:28.446
I...

21:28.819 --> 21:30.171
Ended it.

21:30.191 --> 21:31.934
It's over.

21:33.410 --> 21:34.871
How did that go?

21:35.197 --> 21:37.751
It's awful. Look, I really don't
want to talk about it.

21:38.855 --> 21:39.997
Of course.

21:40.017 --> 21:42.596
Just know if you ever
want to talk, I'm here.

21:42.616 --> 21:44.606
I've been there.

21:46.046 --> 21:47.187
How have you been there?

21:47.207 --> 21:48.925
Well, you know, Tom...

21:48.945 --> 21:50.861
You started an affair
with a married man,

21:50.881 --> 21:52.238
knowing he was married.

21:52.258 --> 21:55.000
I didn't do that.
We're not the same.

21:57.668 --> 21:58.727
You're right. I'm...

21:58.747 --> 22:00.730
Sorry I mentioned it.

22:01.465 --> 22:03.061
I should give Lucy her present.

22:20.431 --> 22:21.825
Joss:
You know what, Javi?

22:21.845 --> 22:23.612
Uh, will you just take

22:23.632 --> 22:26.280
some of these sodas
to the valets, please?

22:26.300 --> 22:27.826
Thank you.

22:38.742 --> 22:40.916
Yep, coming right up!

22:40.951 --> 22:43.112
Where's Javier? We need
the buttermilk steamed chicken.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.319
Oh, uh, we're out.

22:44.354 --> 22:45.988
What? We can't be.

22:46.022 --> 22:48.047
I just made a whole new plate.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.658
Oh, well, maybe Javier
already took them out.

22:49.692 --> 22:50.822
You just missed him.
He's quick.

22:50.842 --> 22:52.361
The Kennebec fries are gone,
too. I just put...

22:52.395 --> 22:54.301
Oh, no, I definitely
saw those go out.

22:54.321 --> 22:57.038
On, come on, let's just have a drink.
It's our last party, Harry.

22:57.058 --> 22:59.371
- Has the dog been in here?
- Huh?

22:59.391 --> 23:00.351
Do they have a dog?

23:00.371 --> 23:03.349
Where the hell is
all my food going?! Javier?!

23:12.682 --> 23:14.245
The '90s are back in, right?

23:14.265 --> 23:15.950
Not that back.

23:18.288 --> 23:20.315
Okay.
How about this one?

23:20.335 --> 23:22.591
Now that you should definitely
get rid of.

23:24.232 --> 23:25.316
Do you want it?

23:25.336 --> 23:26.532
If you insist.

23:26.552 --> 23:28.463
You can have it.
Here you go.

23:28.707 --> 23:29.707
Ooh!

23:29.731 --> 23:31.132
Hey, can I have these?

23:31.423 --> 23:33.004
Well, I'm not dying.

23:33.024 --> 23:34.394
You're downsizing.

23:34.414 --> 23:35.603
I'm pretty sure
those little earrings

23:35.637 --> 23:37.670
are gonna fit in my new condo.

23:37.690 --> 23:40.441
I can't believe you're
not gonna live here anymore.

23:41.580 --> 23:42.875
Neither can I.

23:43.049 --> 23:44.645
Remember when you had us
all come over

23:44.680 --> 23:46.591
to paint the living room?

23:46.611 --> 23:47.782
Yes!

23:47.817 --> 23:49.411
Oh, and April said
that we should use the rollers.

23:49.431 --> 23:52.386
And Savi insisted we rent those
high-torque paint sprayers.

23:52.406 --> 23:54.255
Which farted and exploded!

24:00.053 --> 24:03.490
I lived here for three
full months after Paul died.

24:03.813 --> 24:04.917
Sort of died.

24:05.128 --> 24:06.593
I hate him.

24:06.804 --> 24:09.025
And Lucy spent
her first birthday here.

24:09.273 --> 24:12.367
And the party
celebrating my doctorate.

24:12.387 --> 24:13.941
My graduation party.

24:16.631 --> 24:18.282
Real-estate school.

24:19.361 --> 24:22.483
My 30th, 31st...

24:22.938 --> 24:24.218
And 35th.

24:28.026 --> 24:29.465
It's a good house.

24:32.623 --> 24:35.528
You know what?
Come here, girls.

24:37.711 --> 24:39.870
To Savi's house.

24:40.652 --> 24:42.015
The good times.

24:42.035 --> 24:44.704
And the tough times
that made us stronger.

24:47.743 --> 24:49.642
To my house.

24:55.050 --> 24:56.149
Hello?

24:56.601 --> 24:57.601
Hey, Mary.

24:57.892 --> 25:01.181
Oh, you found Anna's address?
I'm writing it down now.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.738
Good. Okay.

25:04.311 --> 25:05.452
I'm so sorry.
I have to go.

25:05.472 --> 25:07.542
Hey, Karen, I was...
I was hoping...

25:07.562 --> 25:08.753
it's okay.

25:11.496 --> 25:12.935
It's okay.

25:15.224 --> 25:17.929
Uh, you know what? I'd better
go, too. Scott's waiting on me.

25:18.103 --> 25:19.105
- Bye.
- Bye.

25:19.139 --> 25:20.684
Bye.

25:21.776 --> 25:23.975
And then there were two.

25:24.705 --> 25:25.851
How are you?

25:25.871 --> 25:26.745
I haven't really talked to you

25:26.765 --> 25:29.334
since you decided
to end things with Daniel.

25:30.115 --> 25:31.216
I'm...

25:31.791 --> 25:33.111
fine.

25:33.131 --> 25:36.984
There's just been a...
a lot of changes lately.

25:38.002 --> 25:39.726
It's the end of an era.

25:45.694 --> 25:47.232
Bye.
- Bye.

26:05.438 --> 26:06.662
May I help you?

26:06.682 --> 26:09.847
Yes, um... I'm looking
for Anna Choi.

26:10.368 --> 26:11.919
There's no one here
by that name.

26:12.552 --> 26:14.505
Did you move in recently?

26:14.525 --> 26:16.794
No, I've lived here
for 35 years.

26:17.932 --> 26:19.067
Oh.

26:19.087 --> 26:20.725
So sorry to bother you.

26:36.671 --> 26:38.065
Hi, Jacob.

26:38.085 --> 26:39.964
Maybe I wasn't clear.

26:39.984 --> 26:41.106
When I said
I didn't want to talk,

26:41.126 --> 26:43.836
that included texting me
or stopping by my office.

26:43.856 --> 26:45.779
I'm not here for myself.

26:46.846 --> 26:48.865
This is about Anna Choi.

26:50.391 --> 26:51.894
Well...

26:52.277 --> 26:54.275
Well,
h-h-how do you know Anna?

26:54.585 --> 26:56.285
She's my patient.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.294
This is why you ended things?

27:01.314 --> 27:03.106
I don't know
if I should even be here,

27:03.140 --> 27:08.111
except I think
her life may be in danger.

27:18.009 --> 27:19.696
When was the last time
you spoke to her?

27:20.938 --> 27:23.859
A few days ago when I, you know,
broke things off.

27:23.879 --> 27:25.149
How did she take it?

27:25.169 --> 27:26.825
Uh, it was over the phone.
I don't really know.

27:26.845 --> 27:28.984
I mean,
w-we weren't that serious.

27:29.004 --> 27:30.628
She was serious.

27:31.578 --> 27:33.507
W-well, h-have you tried
calling her?

27:33.527 --> 27:36.199
Yes, and I've left messages.

27:36.219 --> 27:38.135
Plus, I got
a strange call from her

27:38.155 --> 27:41.461
where she didn't say anything,
but I could hear she was crying.

27:41.481 --> 27:43.173
W-why don't you just
knock on her door?

27:43.193 --> 27:45.419
I mean, she lives
in your building, right?

27:45.439 --> 27:47.405
Uh, what are you talking about?

27:47.425 --> 27:48.708
I-I met her
in your lobby.

27:48.728 --> 27:50.917
W-when I came to... to see you
a couple months ago,

27:50.937 --> 27:52.138
she told me she lived there.

27:54.813 --> 27:58.603
Can you call her
just so that I know she's okay?

27:58.623 --> 28:01.142
She might answer a call
from you. I...

28:05.563 --> 28:07.400
Straight to voicemail.

28:08.405 --> 28:10.812
Hey, Anna,
it's... it's Jacob.

28:11.012 --> 28:12.994
Uh, could you give me a call
when you get this?

28:13.470 --> 28:15.096
I-I'd like to talk.

28:15.654 --> 28:17.118
Bye.

28:17.788 --> 28:19.768
Will you call me
if you hear from her?

28:19.802 --> 28:21.169
Of course.

28:21.203 --> 28:22.670
- Thank you.
- Sure.

28:22.704 --> 28:25.689
Hey, look, the other day,
the things I said...

28:25.999 --> 28:27.897
You couldn't have known.

28:31.322 --> 28:32.762
I'll see you?

28:48.193 --> 28:51.599
Hey. I got your text.
What's up?

28:52.425 --> 28:54.636
Guess where I just was.

28:54.656 --> 28:57.504
Hmm, spending way too much
on pressed juice.

28:57.538 --> 28:58.871
Having breakfast...

28:59.334 --> 29:01.040
With Greta Jager.

29:01.729 --> 29:03.769
- Fascinating.
- Oh, isn't it, though?

29:03.789 --> 29:06.346
You know what's even more
fascinating, uh, Joss,

29:06.380 --> 29:09.182
she wants to make me
the head chef of Wunderbar.

29:10.433 --> 29:12.031
- That's amaze-balls!
- It really is...

29:12.051 --> 29:13.366
Yeah!
- Amaze-balls,

29:13.386 --> 29:16.723
considering Greta had never even
been to Savannah's kitchen.

29:17.717 --> 29:19.025
Well, she must have,
uh... what?

29:19.059 --> 29:20.092
Tried your food somewhere else,

29:20.127 --> 29:21.328
maybe at one of
the parties we catered.

29:21.362 --> 29:23.495
Cut the crap.
You were the dog.

29:23.530 --> 29:25.967
I know you were the dog.

29:26.315 --> 29:27.556
So, I pocketed some food.

29:29.536 --> 29:31.169
She said that you...

29:31.204 --> 29:33.004
Set up a secret taste test?

29:33.039 --> 29:35.341
Oh, ple...
okay, that's an exaggeration.

29:35.375 --> 29:36.842
G-Greta was having
a little get-together,

29:36.876 --> 29:38.344
and I placed
some of your plates around

29:38.378 --> 29:41.379
where Dieter's dishes were,
and yours were way more popular!

29:41.399 --> 29:45.283
Like "Sluttiest girl in school"
popular.

29:46.219 --> 29:47.785
You had no right to do that.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.921
I specifically asked you
not to do this, Joss.

29:50.178 --> 29:51.923
I just...
What?

29:51.958 --> 29:53.439
God, I thought...
I was trying to help you!

29:53.459 --> 29:55.002
I didn't ask for your help,
Joss.

29:55.022 --> 29:57.528
I can take care of my own life.
Thank you very much!

29:57.563 --> 29:59.030
Wow! Fine!

29:59.065 --> 30:00.951
Then don't take the job!
Move back to Australia!

30:00.971 --> 30:01.900
I don't care!

30:01.934 --> 30:04.599
Pbht. Well, I'm...
I'm taking the job.

30:05.715 --> 30:06.715
What did you say?

30:06.739 --> 30:09.206
Headlining at the hottest
new restaurant in L.A.

30:09.489 --> 30:10.797
I'm not an idiot.

30:11.642 --> 30:13.043
Well, you could have led
with that!

30:16.748 --> 30:19.750
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Yes!

30:21.822 --> 30:24.121
All right, that's enough
phone time for today.

30:24.308 --> 30:26.423
Please, just a little more.

30:26.457 --> 30:29.559
Maybe after you've studied
for your spelling test.

30:29.731 --> 30:31.560
But this is an emergency!

30:31.595 --> 30:32.560
Peyton just found out

30:32.580 --> 30:35.131
her dad has been sleeping
with Alexa's mom.

30:35.525 --> 30:37.808
Everyone's saying
they did it at the food drive.

30:37.982 --> 30:39.568
What?!

30:39.603 --> 30:41.137
They did it at school?

30:41.841 --> 30:44.473
Everyone's texting Peyton,
asking if it's true.

30:44.750 --> 30:46.289
She's denying it.

30:46.309 --> 30:49.645
I feel so bad for her.
Not only that, she...

30:50.098 --> 30:51.314
What? What is it?

30:54.444 --> 30:57.601
Peyton made me promise
not to tell anyone, but...

30:57.621 --> 31:00.202
You're my mom,
so I don't think it counts.

31:00.351 --> 31:04.396
Peyton told me her dad
has cheated on her mom before.

31:04.416 --> 31:06.261
And her mom knows about it.

31:06.541 --> 31:09.264
But it's the first time the kids
at school have found out.

31:11.468 --> 31:13.279
What are you thinking?

31:14.471 --> 31:17.272
I just...
I don't get it.

31:17.464 --> 31:19.648
Who would do that
with a married man?

31:19.668 --> 31:21.683
It's so mean to his wife.

31:21.703 --> 31:23.779
Uh, there's no easy answer
for that.

31:23.814 --> 31:26.114
Well I think it's gross.

31:26.484 --> 31:29.283
And Peyton's mom
is so smart and pretty...

31:29.318 --> 31:31.423
deserves so much better.

31:31.895 --> 31:34.575
Why does she stay with him
if he keeps cheating on her?

31:37.921 --> 31:39.694
Maybe because...

31:39.728 --> 31:42.302
some people don't think
they deserve better.

31:42.798 --> 31:45.066
They don't think they can

31:45.100 --> 31:47.735
demand more
of the people they're with.

31:49.086 --> 31:52.883
Some people use being in love
as an excuse.

31:53.591 --> 31:56.611
Which is why
I am always reminding you

31:56.631 --> 31:59.747
of how important it is
to know your self-worth.

31:59.782 --> 32:01.100
To believe in myself?

32:01.120 --> 32:03.017
And to value yourself.

32:03.051 --> 32:06.890
Because when you do,
other people will, too.

32:07.572 --> 32:10.015
When I grow up,
I want to be just like you.

32:19.541 --> 32:20.844
Yep.

32:20.864 --> 32:24.071
Yeah, sending you the amended
discovery responses right now.

32:24.106 --> 32:25.239
Okay, great.

32:25.393 --> 32:27.741
Great.
- You know where to reach me.

32:27.775 --> 32:28.775
Huh.

32:28.788 --> 32:31.262
I thought part time meant when you're
not at the office, you're not working.

32:31.282 --> 32:34.948
Oh, no, it just means that
I'm in the office part time.

32:35.265 --> 32:36.705
I have news.

32:36.953 --> 32:39.137
Okay. Good news?

32:39.157 --> 32:41.028
Well, I think it's good, but if
you don't think it's not good,

32:41.048 --> 32:42.952
we don't have to talk about it.

32:42.972 --> 32:44.354
Okay.

32:45.788 --> 32:47.258
Harry's not moving.

32:47.531 --> 32:49.195
He's staying in L.A.

32:51.216 --> 32:52.413
I'm glad.

32:52.433 --> 32:53.433
Yeah?

32:55.773 --> 32:57.303
But I have claim on the house.

32:59.140 --> 33:01.373
I'm not moving either.

33:01.408 --> 33:02.808
Whoa. Wait. What?!

33:02.843 --> 33:04.688
I'm keeping the house.

33:04.708 --> 33:06.478
But...
You're in escrow.

33:06.513 --> 33:08.714
I know,
and it's gonna cost me, too.

33:08.749 --> 33:09.749
What about Harry's cut?

33:09.766 --> 33:11.167
I'll buy him out.

33:11.187 --> 33:13.989
Savi, this is huge!
What... what the hell happened?

33:14.009 --> 33:15.771
Last night happened.

33:15.791 --> 33:17.483
Just being with you guys
and remembering

33:17.503 --> 33:22.294
that this house holds
some really good memories, too.

33:22.328 --> 33:24.749
Huh, or you could take
the memories with you.

33:24.885 --> 33:26.164
Yeah, that's what mom said

33:26.198 --> 33:27.999
each and every time
she tried to uproot us

33:28.034 --> 33:29.601
from some place we loved.

33:30.978 --> 33:32.785
You know, I was thinking
about it the other day.

33:32.805 --> 33:37.108
Do you know how many times we
moved before I left for college?

33:38.997 --> 33:40.201
11.

33:40.536 --> 33:42.146
Yeah.

33:42.384 --> 33:45.316
And three more times
after you left.

33:45.350 --> 33:48.319
This place is the longest
I've lived anywhere...

33:48.502 --> 33:49.988
My entire life.

33:50.537 --> 33:55.240
It's truly the first place
that has ever felt like home.

34:03.658 --> 34:05.127
Anna!

34:05.147 --> 34:06.804
Sorry I missed
my last appointment.

34:06.838 --> 34:07.765
I know I should have called.

34:07.785 --> 34:10.313
But I just...
I had to get out of here.

34:10.333 --> 34:12.523
I drove to Joshua Tree!

34:12.543 --> 34:15.779
Don't worry...
I didn't drop acid or anything.

34:16.071 --> 34:18.514
I'm just glad you're okay.

34:19.322 --> 34:20.951
Uh, let me get my book,

34:20.985 --> 34:24.054
and we can set up a proper time
for us to talk.

34:24.074 --> 34:27.123
I needed to clear my head.
Last week was horrible.

34:27.143 --> 34:30.231
Remember that guy I was telling you about
the one I've been seeing?

34:30.251 --> 34:34.030
A few days ago, he called and
said he couldn't see me anymore.

34:34.063 --> 34:36.204
Over the phone.

34:36.725 --> 34:38.152
I'm sorry to hear that.

34:38.172 --> 34:41.495
Out of the blue,
and his reasons made no sense.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.406
He said I was too young.

34:43.426 --> 34:44.974
We've been sleeping together
for weeks,

34:44.994 --> 34:47.940
and you just realized
I was young?

34:48.312 --> 34:51.018
I thought maybe there was
someone else, but...

34:51.167 --> 34:53.382
Just as I was starting
to feel centered again,

34:53.416 --> 34:55.551
guess who calls
and leaves a message.

34:55.585 --> 34:56.885
The guy.

34:56.918 --> 34:59.154
And you know what that means.

34:59.664 --> 35:01.189
What does it mean to you?

35:01.223 --> 35:03.091
He clearly wants to
get back together.

35:03.126 --> 35:04.425
I could hear it in his voice.

35:04.460 --> 35:08.018
He said he wanted to talk.
Why else would he call?

35:10.537 --> 35:12.000
I'm gonna make him sweat
a little.

35:12.035 --> 35:14.335
I'll wait a few days
to call him. Don't worry.

35:14.558 --> 35:17.105
And...
That's due to you.

35:17.942 --> 35:19.431
How so?

35:20.424 --> 35:22.496
I think this therapy thing
is working.

35:23.713 --> 35:26.393
As bad as last week was,
I was able to deal,

35:26.413 --> 35:28.583
to neutralize
my self-destructive thoughts,

35:28.617 --> 35:30.218
as you say.

35:31.161 --> 35:32.420
I can feel myself changing,

35:32.454 --> 35:35.777
like I'm finally getting better.

35:36.373 --> 35:38.259
Thank you, Dr. Kim.

35:47.966 --> 35:49.549
Hey.

35:49.738 --> 35:51.398
Hi.

35:54.327 --> 35:56.344
What's wrong?

35:58.472 --> 36:00.815
I've come to say goodbye.

36:14.548 --> 36:17.517
What do you want me to say?
It's over. It's done.

36:17.551 --> 36:21.645
- Yeah, but last night...
- I still love you. God, I love you.

36:21.665 --> 36:23.856
I wish I didn't, but I do.

36:23.891 --> 36:25.281
Well, then why are you
doing this?

36:25.301 --> 36:27.961
Because being with you
is turning me into someone

36:27.981 --> 36:29.695
I cannot stand.

36:29.730 --> 36:33.033
I'm a hypocrite in church.
I am lying to my friends,

36:33.067 --> 36:35.868
saying things I can't believe
are coming out my mouth,

36:35.903 --> 36:38.003
pretending like this isn't
hurting your wife.

36:38.038 --> 36:39.567
She doesn't know!

36:39.587 --> 36:41.706
You think
- It still doesn't do damage?!

36:41.741 --> 36:44.171
If there's one thing I know...

36:47.249 --> 36:50.599
And even if there weren't
all that, there's Lucy.

36:52.642 --> 36:54.802
If I let her down...

36:54.951 --> 36:57.532
I would never forgive myself.

37:02.111 --> 37:04.629
I'm sorry... Daniel.

37:04.971 --> 37:06.999
No, look.
Please, don't, April.

37:07.033 --> 37:08.731
April, don't do this.

37:09.463 --> 37:11.994
I won't be calling you again.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.513
Ta-da!

37:21.547 --> 37:22.965
- Last box?
- Mm-hmm.

37:22.985 --> 37:24.789
I'm officially moved in.

37:24.809 --> 37:27.097
I love it. All right
taking you out to celebrate.

37:27.117 --> 37:29.095
- How does Sushi sound?
- Oh, fab.

37:29.115 --> 37:30.510
Oh, but can we do it
on the later side?

37:30.530 --> 37:31.825
Because I have to go meet Harry

37:31.845 --> 37:33.997
to brainstorm about
the new wunderbar menu.

37:34.017 --> 37:36.661
Uh, wait, Harry is...

37:37.415 --> 37:38.929
Wait, did Greta not told you?

37:40.091 --> 37:42.069
Wow, you really are a hands-off
investor, aren't you?

37:42.089 --> 37:45.590
He is the new head chef,
and it's all because of moi!

37:45.610 --> 37:48.047
Oh, you're kidding?
That's really great.

37:50.281 --> 37:51.912
What? That's it?

37:51.932 --> 37:54.078
This is...
this is a major coup for...

37:54.098 --> 37:54.881
Yeah.

37:54.901 --> 37:56.159
...the restaurant,
for Harry, for y...

37:56.179 --> 37:57.983
No, I get it.
I-I-I totally get it.

37:58.003 --> 37:59.324
It's just, uh...

37:59.344 --> 38:00.416
What?

38:00.436 --> 38:03.021
You do an awful lot
for this guy.

38:03.443 --> 38:05.627
- Harry?
- Yeah, Harry.

38:05.647 --> 38:07.608
I mean, I understood why you were so upset
that he was leaving before.

38:07.628 --> 38:10.095
It affected your business,
but now you guys...

38:10.115 --> 38:11.162
You guys won't even be partners.

38:11.182 --> 38:12.953
I'm...
I'm trying to figure out...

38:12.973 --> 38:14.932
Why him staying
is so important to you.

38:14.966 --> 38:15.998
It's not.

38:16.018 --> 38:18.885
Well, I mean, it is
- But just because we're friends.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.470
Uh-huh.

38:20.647 --> 38:21.972
Because you were right
all along.

38:22.007 --> 38:24.074
He never would have been happy
at that crab shack,

38:24.108 --> 38:25.494
and I was just trying
to make him realize it

38:25.514 --> 38:27.851
before he made a huge mistake.

38:28.385 --> 38:30.160
Hey, what's wrong with you?

38:33.349 --> 38:35.000
Oh, my God, you're...

38:35.020 --> 38:39.257
No, no, no, you're not worried
about, like, Harry and me...

38:39.277 --> 38:40.021
Right?

38:40.041 --> 38:42.058
Should I be?
I don't know.

38:42.092 --> 38:44.060
Oh, my God, no!

38:44.094 --> 38:45.579
No, no, no, no, no, no!
No!

38:45.599 --> 38:48.462
That would be...
he's like my brother, Scott.

38:48.482 --> 38:50.433
He's... he's, you know,
Savi's ex-husband.

38:50.467 --> 38:52.234
That would never in a million
trillion years happen.

38:52.269 --> 38:53.903
- Okay.
- He's family, yeah?

38:53.938 --> 38:55.809
Just making sure.

38:55.829 --> 38:59.085
Hey, be very, very, very sure.

38:59.296 --> 39:01.952
- Okay? Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:02.957 --> 39:04.490
Is this helping?

39:05.160 --> 39:06.562
Not really?
Is this helping?

39:06.582 --> 39:08.213
That's helping.

39:08.796 --> 39:10.819
- Does this help?
- Mm-hmm.

39:10.853 --> 39:12.154
- It's helpful.
- Mm-hmm?

39:22.700 --> 39:24.586
Toni: Don't worry.
She's not here.

39:28.571 --> 39:30.171
Trouble in paradise?

39:30.206 --> 39:31.737
What do you care?

39:32.221 --> 39:34.107
Ouch. Okay.

39:34.127 --> 39:36.903
You really think I'm gonna talk
about my personal life with you?

39:36.923 --> 39:38.777
I don't know
what's going on with you,

39:38.797 --> 39:42.686
and you don't have to tell me,
but if you do want to talk,

39:42.706 --> 39:46.620
you can because...
don't take this wrong,

39:46.640 --> 39:48.803
but I don't know how many other
people you have in your life

39:48.823 --> 39:50.691
to talk about this with.

39:51.223 --> 39:52.527
I have friends, Toni.

39:52.561 --> 39:55.454
I know you do. Sure.

39:56.621 --> 39:59.614
But, really, how often
do you talk to them?

40:00.614 --> 40:03.163
Since I've known you,
you're always here.

40:03.183 --> 40:06.906
And when you're not,
I'm assuming you were with Savi.

40:07.258 --> 40:10.644
You're the guy who wants
his name on the building.

40:10.678 --> 40:13.480
I know this
because I'm the same way.

40:13.515 --> 40:16.475
And I also know one
of the first things you give up

40:16.495 --> 40:19.386
on your way to the top
is friends.

40:19.954 --> 40:22.597
Look, I can I'm say I'm sorry
till I go blue in the face,

40:22.617 --> 40:26.283
but you won't take it, and I
really don't expect you to.

40:26.742 --> 40:30.724
But just know
if you ever want to talk...

40:30.744 --> 40:32.965
I'm here till midnight, too.

40:42.943 --> 40:44.432
Thank you, Toni.

40:52.477 --> 40:53.818
Thanks for having me over.

40:53.838 --> 40:56.771
I-I-I just wanted to
talk this through.

40:56.791 --> 40:59.005
Anna called me back.

40:59.025 --> 41:02.061
Already?
What did you say?

41:02.339 --> 41:04.535
Nothing.
I-I let it go to voicemail.

41:04.555 --> 41:05.764
Well, you have to call her back.

41:05.784 --> 41:07.104
I-I know I have to
call her back.

41:07.124 --> 41:08.779
That's the problem...
to say what?

41:08.799 --> 41:10.504
I mean, d-does she think
I want her back?

41:10.524 --> 41:14.554
She sounded kind of...
I don't know... Hopeful.

41:15.286 --> 41:17.576
You can't. Sorry.

41:17.768 --> 41:19.170
It's my fault.

41:19.443 --> 41:21.590
If I hadn't come to you,
you wouldn't have called her.

41:21.610 --> 41:23.407
I-I-I'll figure it out.

41:23.427 --> 41:27.419
I'll be... caring but...
noncommittal.

41:27.453 --> 41:29.562
Jacob, we really can't...

41:29.582 --> 41:32.022
Right. Sorry.

41:34.355 --> 41:35.807
Yeah.

41:37.433 --> 41:40.236
Is that all
you wanted to talk to me about?

41:40.256 --> 41:41.688
Uh, no.

41:41.912 --> 41:45.103
Um, I-I know this isn't
the time or the place,

41:45.137 --> 41:47.606
but once this is resolved...

41:47.843 --> 41:49.941
do you think we could ever...

41:49.975 --> 41:51.908
pick up where we left off?

41:52.825 --> 41:55.207
I really hope so, Jacob.

41:59.425 --> 42:01.286
I'll walk you out.

42:13.865 --> 42:16.032
I can take it from here.

42:31.738 --> 42:33.683
Good night, Karen.

42:44.169 --> 42:45.670
Anna.
