06:09.600 --> 06:10.567
I THOUGHT HE SAID, "MA."

06:10.667 --> 06:12.767
DON'T BE IGNORANT TO ME.
BACK OFF ME.

06:12.867 --> 06:15.433
I'M NOT A CRIMINAL.
I'VE NEVER BEEN A CRIMINAL,

06:24.633 --> 06:27.967
A FEW WEEKS AGO, HE WAS ABLE
TO GET AWAY FROM A FEW OFFICERS
IN A FOOT PURSUIT.

06:28.067 --> 06:30.567
-SEVERAL TIMES,

I THINK ONE OF 'EM
IS FOR ROBBERY,

06:37.900 --> 06:40.567
SO DEFINITELY GOOD TO
GET HIM OFF THE STREETS.

06:44.167 --> 06:46.867

THEY CAN DO TO GET AWAY

06:49.333 --> 06:51.533
WHILE WE'RE DOING WHATEVER
WE CAN DO TO CATCH 'EM.

YOU MIGHT GO FROM JUST SIMPLY
TALKING AND THEY'RE COMPLYING

06:55.267 --> 06:58.333

BIGGEST FIGHTS YOU'VE
BEEN IN IN YOUR CAREER.

08:01.533 --> 08:03.167
FACE THAT WAY.

08:03.267 --> 08:05.267

08:05.367 --> 08:07.967
-NO! (shouts) CHILL OUT!

08:19.367 --> 08:21.133
-GET ON YOUR FACE!
-IT'S A LIGHTER!

08:21.233 --> 08:24.067
-GET ON YOUR FACE!
-JUST PUT 'EM BACK
BEHIND YOUR BACK!

08:24.100 --> 08:26.333
-IT WAS ON THE SEAT!
I PUT A LIGHTER IN THERE!
-HE THREW IT IN THE CAR.

08:26.433 --> 08:29.067
I SAW IT.
-IT WAS A LIGHTER!

08:29.133 --> 08:31.867
MAN, I SWEAR TO GOD
IT WAS A LIGHTER.
WHAT YOU DOING?

08:31.967 --> 08:34.567
-MAN, YOU GOT
ANYTHING ELSE ON YOU?
-NO!

08:34.667 --> 08:37.067
-ROLL OVER ON YOUR SIDE.
WE'RE GONNA PAT YOU DOWN
FOR A WEAPON.

08:38.400 --> 08:41.633
-I DON'T HAVE NOTHING!
MAN, I JUST GOT OFF OF WORK.
I'M A WORKING MAN!

08:41.733 --> 08:45.300
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND...
I PROBABLY GOT A SWISHER ON ME,

08:45.400 --> 08:47.200
A CIGAR. THAT'S IT.

08:47.300 --> 08:50.067
I NEVER DO NOTHING!
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

08:50.133 --> 08:53.133
-(radio chatter)
-ARE Y'ALL SERIOUS, MAN?

08:53.233 --> 08:56.067
WHAT DID I DO?
-HE HAS CRACK COCAINE.

08:56.167 --> 08:58.567
THAT'S WHAT YOU DID.
-I GOT NO CRACK COCAINE
IN MY CAR! THAT'S A RENTAL!

08:58.667 --> 09:01.067
-THIS IS ACTUALLY
GONNA BE HEROIN.
-OH MY GOD, MAN!

09:01.167 --> 09:04.067
-I SAW IT IN HIS HAND.
THAT'S WHY I PUSHED HIM
UP AGAINST THE CAR.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.633
HE REACHED HIS HAND
IN HERE AND JUST KINDA
FLIPPED IT RIGHT HERE.

09:06.733 --> 09:10.567
-(man mumbles)
-IT'S HEROIN, RIGHT?

09:10.667 --> 09:12.767
-NO, SIR! ARE YOU SERIOUS?

09:12.867 --> 09:15.600
-JUST DO--
DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD, MAN.

09:15.700 --> 09:17.400
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.067

09:37.800 --> 09:40.733

09:40.833 --> 09:42.967

09:49.067 --> 09:51.267
'CAUSE HE DON'T--

10:05.333 --> 10:06.733
-NO.

10:06.833 --> 10:08.667
-HAVE YOU EVER BEEN

10:14.733 --> 10:17.300
-LEANDRE.
-LEANDRE, YOU HAVE

10:17.400 --> 10:20.100
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN

IN A COURT OF LAW.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.800

10:21.900 --> 10:24.433
Y'ALL GOT TO-- HEY,

10:32.967 --> 10:35.100
AND HAVE HIM OR HER PRESENT
WITH YOU WHILE YOU'RE
BEING QUESTIONED.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.867
IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD
TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY,

10:36.967 --> 10:40.367
ONE WILL BE APPOINTED
TO REPRESENT YOU BEFORE
ANY QUESTIONING IF YOU WISH.

10:40.467 --> 10:42.300
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.100
-I'M NOT ANSWERING NOTHING.
-DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

10:44.200 --> 10:47.100
-I'M NOT ANSWERING NOTHING
UNTIL I TALK TO ME A LAWYER.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.167
-YOU HAVE ANYTHING HIDDEN
IN YOUR BUTT, DUDE?

10:49.267 --> 10:51.167
I GOT A BLUNT FOR ME TO SMOKE.

10:51.267 --> 10:54.400

10:54.500 --> 10:56.233

-SET IT ON THE BACK.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.467
-THANK YOU.

11:15.567 --> 11:18.667
-THAT'S IT, MAN.
-'CAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL.
IF YOU TAKE ANYTHING INTO JAIL--

11:18.767 --> 11:20.833
-(man mumbles)

11:20.933 --> 11:23.800
-SIR, JUST TO LET YOU KNOW,
I ALREADY CHECKED THE BACK SEAT.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.067
SO, YOU DIDN'T STUFF

11:28.933 --> 11:30.600
-BUT I SWEAR TO GOD...

11:33.067 --> 11:35.233

11:39.500 --> 11:41.533

11:45.900 --> 11:47.933
-YOU BANGING OR SOMETHING?

11:49.067 --> 11:51.100
-NO, DON'T FLIP OUT, MAN.
OKAY, I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.333
I PROMISE. I'M CLAUSTROPHOBIC.
-NO, MAN, YOU'RE GETTING
A SEAT BELT,

11:53.433 --> 11:55.500
AND IF YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE,
I'M GONNA TIE YOUR
FEET TOGETHER.

11:55.600 --> 11:56.967
-OKAY, I'M GOOD. NO SEAT BELT.

11:57.067 --> 11:58.367
-THEN JUST ACT
LIKE AN ADULT, DUDE.

11:58.467 --> 12:00.367
-I WILL, I WILL. I SWEAR TO GOD.
NO SEATBELT, PLEASE.

12:00.467 --> 12:02.833
I PROMISE YOU, I GOT IT.
NO SEAT BELT. ALL RIGHT?

12:02.933 --> 12:05.667
I REALLY CAN'T LOSE MY JOB, MAN.
-WE'RE GONNA SEAT BELT YOU.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.633
-YOU'RE GONNA...
-OKAY, SIR?

12:07.733 --> 12:10.900
-(crying)
I DIDN'T SAY NOTHING.
OH GOD, PLEASE, NO.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.367
OH GOD!

12:17.933 --> 12:20.067
-ALL RIGHT,
I'M JUST TESTING THIS SUBSTANCE

12:20.167 --> 12:22.100
I BELIEVE TO BE HEROIN...

12:23.100 --> 12:24.167
WITH THIS...

12:25.333 --> 12:28.133
TEST KIT. BASICALLY,
YOU BREAK THESE AMPULES

12:28.233 --> 12:31.667
IF IT TURNS TO THAT GREEN COLOR,
IT'LL BE A POSITIVE.

12:35.467 --> 12:37.500
BUT YOU CAN ALREADY SEE

12:37.600 --> 12:39.933
IT'S TURNING GREEN
RIGHT HERE ON THE BOTTOM,

12:40.067 --> 12:41.833
SO THAT'LL BE
A POSITIVE FOR HEROIN.

12:41.933 --> 12:44.700
SO, WE GOT POSSESSION OF HEROIN,

12:44.800 --> 12:46.600
POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA...
-YEAH.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.267
-...INTERFERING.
-YEAH.

12:51.067 --> 12:52.667
-YOU GOOD, BUD?
-YES, SIR.

12:52.767 --> 12:57.067
-ALL RIGHT. WE DID TEST IT.
IT WAS HEROIN, NOT HASH, SO...

12:57.167 --> 12:59.833
-OH MY GOD, I DON'T BELIEVE--
-YOU THOUGHT IT WAS HASH?

13:00.067 --> 13:02.400
-(crying) I DON'T KNOW.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.433
-BUT, LOOK, LOOK--
-THAT'S NOTHING
TO PLAY WITH. NO.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.900
-YEAH, BUT YOU'LL STILL GET OUT
TONIGHT ON BOND, MAN.

13:07.900 --> 13:09.367
ALL RIGHT, IT IS WHAT IT IS.

13:09.467 --> 13:11.767
WE'RE GONNA BE COOL WITH YOU.
JUST BE COOL WITH US.

13:16.333 --> 13:19.633
-I'VE BEEN WITH BOISE P.D. NOW
FOR ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF YEARS.

13:19.733 --> 13:22.533
A TOTAL OF 19.
I KNOW THAT'S A COMMON THING,

13:22.633 --> 13:24.767
THAT WHEN YOU ASK
A POLICE OFFICER

13:24.867 --> 13:26.933
WHAT HE WANTED TO DO,
THAT HE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE A POLICE OFFICER

13:27.067 --> 13:28.133
BUT FOR ME, THAT WAS THE TRUTH.

13:28.233 --> 13:30.567
WHAT WITH MY DREAMS,
IT WORKED OUT FOR ME.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.833
YEAH, WE'RE STOPPING
THIS CAR RIGHT NOW.

13:32.933 --> 13:35.600
IT'S GOT
A FRONT SIGNAL THAT'S...

13:35.700 --> 13:37.067
APPARENTLY THE BULB
IS OUT ON IT.

13:37.167 --> 13:38.867
THE REAR ONE WORKS,
BUT THE FRONT ONE'S NOT,

13:38.967 --> 13:41.400
SO WE'LL STOP HIM AND HAVE
A TALK WITH HIM ABOUT IT.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.067
23-17, TRAFFIC.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.167
-(radio chatter)

13:50.267 --> 13:52.067
-(engine running loudly)

13:53.900 --> 13:55.900
-HOW WE DOING TONIGHT?

13:57.167 --> 13:59.167
DO YOU HEAR ME?
HOW YOU DOING, MAN?

13:59.267 --> 14:00.533
-PRETTY GOOD.

14:01.767 --> 14:03.900
CAN YOU HAND ME
YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE,
REGISTRATION, INSURANCE?

14:04.067 --> 14:08.267
THE REASON I STOPPED YOU, BUD,
YOUR FRONT SIGNAL IS NOT
WORKING TO THE LEFT.

14:09.267 --> 14:12.300
-I KNOW.
-OKAY? YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT WORKING?

14:12.400 --> 14:14.200
-YEAH.
-WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IT?

14:14.300 --> 14:16.967
-IT NEEDS A BULB.
-CAN YOU TURN YOUR CAR OFF?

14:17.067 --> 14:18.567
-(engine stops)

14:18.667 --> 14:21.367
-ARE YOU LIVING RIGHT HERE NOW?
-DROPPING ME OFF.

14:21.467 --> 14:22.800
-I'M DROPPING HIM OFF.
-DROPPING YOU OFF?

14:22.900 --> 14:24.767
-MM-HMM.
-OKAY. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

14:24.867 --> 14:26.233
-CHARLIE.
-YEAH?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.533
-HOLD ON A SECOND, CHARLIE.
YOU DON'T HAVE I.D. ON YOU?

14:29.633 --> 14:31.333
-NOPE.
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT
WITH THESE GUYS TONIGHT?

14:31.433 --> 14:34.600
-OH, I JUST HAD TO RUN
FROM A FRIEND'S HOUSE,
PLAYING VIDEO GAMES TO HIM.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.733
-YOU HAD TO GO TO YOUR FRIEND'S
TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES?

14:36.833 --> 14:37.967
AND HOW OLD ARE YOU?
-15.

14:38.067 --> 14:39.433
-YOU HAD ANYTHING
TO DRINK TONIGHT?

14:39.533 --> 14:41.667
-NO.
-NOTHING AT ALL?

14:41.767 --> 14:43.133
-NO.
-ANYBODY BEEN DRINKING?

14:43.233 --> 14:45.600
-I WAS JUST HANGING OUT
WITH FRIENDS, 'CAUSE--

14:45.700 --> 14:48.167
-ALL RIGHT, STAY RIGHT
WHERE YOU'RE AT. I'M GONNA
COME OVER AND TALK TO HIM.

14:50.067 --> 14:52.733
YOU JUST KINDA SOUND
LIKE YOU'VE GOT SLURRED SPEECH.
IS THAT HOW YOU ALWAYS TALK?

14:52.833 --> 14:55.133
-NO.
-NO. BECAUSE YOU'RE NERVOUS
OR WHAT?

14:55.233 --> 14:57.267
-YEAH.
-DON'T BE NERVOUS.
I'M JUST TALKING TO YA.

14:57.367 --> 14:58.933
OKAY?
-OKAY.

14:59.067 --> 15:02.867
-OKAY, HAVE YOU--
HAVE YOU TAKEN ANYTHING TONIGHT?
ANY ALCOHOL?

15:02.967 --> 15:05.167
NOTHING AT ALL?
EVERYTHING'S COOL THERE?

15:05.267 --> 15:06.667
-YEAH.

15:08.233 --> 15:09.233
JUST WITH YOUR EYES.

15:11.133 --> 15:14.067
ALL THE WAY OUT.
BE HONEST WITH ME, MAN.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.600
BE HONEST WITH ME.

15:16.633 --> 15:19.067
IF YOU'RE NOT
BEING HONEST WITH ME,
THEN IT'S GONNA GO SOUTH.

15:20.067 --> 15:22.067
COME ON OUT.
-I DRANK A LITTLE BIT.

15:22.133 --> 15:24.067
-ALL RIGHT, NOW WE'RE

COME ON OUT.

15:24.133 --> 15:27.100

-NO, SIR, I HAVEN'T.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.500

15:41.567 --> 15:44.300
-THREE BEERS IN MY POCKETS.

JUST STAY RIGHT THERE.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.900
23-17.

15:56.133 --> 15:59.067
OKAY? SIT BACK UP FOR NOW.
I DON'T WANT 'EM BROKEN.

15:59.167 --> 16:02.067
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.
HAVE A SEAT, MAN.

16:05.300 --> 16:07.567
WHERE'D YOU STEAL THESE FROM?
THE STORE?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.133
-NOPE.
-WHERE'D YOU GET 'EM?

16:09.233 --> 16:11.600
-A FRIEND'S HOUSE.
-DOES HE KNOW YOU STOLE 'EM?

16:11.700 --> 16:14.467
-NOPE.
-WERE THEY GIVEN TO YOU
OR DID YOU TAKE 'EM?

16:14.567 --> 16:15.567
-TOOK 'EM.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.067
-THAT'S THE ONLY THING YOU TOOK?

16:18.100 --> 16:19.567
-YEAH.
-WHAT ELSE YOU GOT

16:19.667 --> 16:22.467
-THAT'S IT, SIR, AND THEY DON'T
EVEN KNOW I TOOK THIS, SO...

16:22.567 --> 16:24.533
-WHAT, THESE GUYS
DON'T KNOW YOU TOOK 'EM?
-NUH-UH.

16:24.633 --> 16:26.700
-IS THERE
ANYTHING ELSE IN THE CAR?
-NOT THAT I KNOW OF, NO.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.233
-YOUR MOM HOME?
-PRETTY SURE, YEAH.

16:29.333 --> 16:30.500
-WHAT'S MAMA GONNA SAY?

16:30.600 --> 16:33.067
-SHE'S GONNA BE FLIPPING PISSED.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.500
-SHE'S NOT GONNA
BE HAPPY, IS SHE?

16:34.600 --> 16:36.667
-FIRST TIME DRINKING
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

16:37.767 --> 16:39.333
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS?

16:40.867 --> 16:42.333
-BETTER DAYS.
-I'M OFFICER ANDERSON.

16:42.433 --> 16:44.733
-HI.
-HEY, YOUR SON'S BEEN HONEST
WITH ME UP TO THIS POINT.

16:44.833 --> 16:46.900
OKAY? I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH HIM,

16:47.067 --> 16:50.167
BUT THE PROBLEM IS
THAT HE WAS IN POSSESSION OF...

16:50.267 --> 16:52.500
THESE BEERS RIGHT HERE--
HE HAD 'EM STUFFED
IN HIS PANTS--

16:52.600 --> 16:54.767
AND HE'S BEEN DRINKING TONIGHT.
-(sighs)

16:54.867 --> 16:57.933
-SO, I'M GONNA--
I'M GONNA DO HIM A FAVOR

16:58.067 --> 17:00.933
AND RELEASE HIM BACK TO YOU,
BUT HE'S GONNA GET A TICKET.

17:01.067 --> 17:03.400
-OKAY.
-OKAY? SO, HIS BIGGEST CONCERN

17:03.500 --> 17:06.933
WAS THAT HE WAS GONNA GO
TO JAIL. I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY
SOMETHING THAT MOM CAN HANDLE.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.900
WITH A CITATION
AND HEARING FROM MOM,

17:10.067 --> 17:11.233
I'M SURE THIS'LL
GET RESOLVED, RIGHT?

17:11.333 --> 17:12.967
-OH YEAH, HE'S IN TROUBLE.
-OKAY.

17:13.067 --> 17:14.433
-YUP.
-WHAT DO YOU THINK?

17:14.533 --> 17:17.733
-APPARENTLY I'M BEING STUPID.

17:17.833 --> 17:20.067
-YEAH, YOU'RE IN
SO MUCH TROUBLE.

17:20.100 --> 17:22.067
-HEY, WAYNE...
-WHY WERE YOU DRINKING?

17:22.167 --> 17:23.933
-TRYING TO HAVE FUN.

17:24.067 --> 17:26.800
-(sighs)
-HAVE A SEAT. MOM CAN TALK
TO YOU A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

17:26.900 --> 17:28.567
I NEED TO FINISH
THIS CITATION.
-MM-HMM.

17:28.667 --> 17:33.067
-HAVE A SEAT. IT SOUNDS
LIKE SHE WANTS TO HAVE
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH YOU.

17:33.100 --> 17:35.533
-THAT'S DUMB.
-I DIDN'T THINK
WE'D GET PULLED OVER.

17:36.767 --> 17:37.800
-WHAT?

17:38.833 --> 17:41.167
YOU'RE 15!

17:41.267 --> 17:43.667
-I KNOW, BUT I WAS STILL
JUST TRYING TO GET--

17:43.767 --> 17:46.233
-YOU DON'T KNOW, 'CAUSE LOOK
WHERE YOU'RE AT RIGHT NOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.400
YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO HAVE ALCOHOL
WITH YOU, PERIOD.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.100
YOU'RE NOT 21 YEARS OLD.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.067
THIS DUDE'S 15. YOU'RE HOW OLD?

17:52.133 --> 17:54.367
-26.
-SO YOU'RE-- I MEAN...

17:55.433 --> 17:57.767
DID HE GET THE ALCOHOL FROM YOU?

17:57.867 --> 17:59.500
-NO, SIR, HE DIDN'T.
-JUST GIVE ME A STRAIGHT STORY.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.800
-HE DIDN'T.
-OKAY.

18:00.900 --> 18:02.500
-NO.
-DID YOU KNOW HE HAD IT?

18:02.600 --> 18:04.300
-NO, I DIDN'T.
-IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
IN THE CAR

18:04.400 --> 18:05.600
THAT I WOULD
BE CONCERNED ABOUT?
-NO.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.067
-ANY WEED?
-NO.

18:07.133 --> 18:08.433
-NOTHING?
-NOTHING.

18:09.433 --> 18:11.167
-HERE'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

18:11.267 --> 18:14.800
YOU'RE GONNA GET A CITATION
LIKE I TOLD YOU FOR MINOR
CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL...

18:14.900 --> 18:16.767
-OKAY.
-...AND POSSESSING IT
IS THE SAME CHARGE.

18:16.867 --> 18:18.733
YOU'RE HEADED DOWN
A PATH THAT'S NOT GONNA
BE GOOD FOR YOU,

18:18.833 --> 18:21.767
IF YOU'RE STEALING BEER AT 15.
AND OUT AT THIS HOUR, DRINKING.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.667
THESE GUYS ARE
10 YEARS OLDER THAN YOU.

18:23.767 --> 18:26.133
YOU'RE HANGING OUT WITH GUYS
THAT ARE ALLOWED TO DO THAT,

18:26.233 --> 18:28.167
BECAUSE THEY'RE
THAT AGE, BUT...
-ALL RIGHT.

18:28.267 --> 18:29.967
FOR YOU, NO. OKAY?

18:30.067 --> 18:33.233
-WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS TIME TO HAVE SOME FUN.

18:33.333 --> 18:35.700
-NO.
-WELL, YOU GOTTA WAIT YOUR TURN.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.900
-ALL RIGHT.
-YOUR TIME TO HAVE FUN
WITH THIS IS 21.

18:38.067 --> 18:39.900
-YOU'RE TOO YOUNG.
YOU'RE GONNA SCREW
ALL YOUR INTESTINES UP

18:40.067 --> 18:42.367
BEFORE YOU'RE EVEN
OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW

18:42.467 --> 18:44.733
WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE.
-ALL RIGHT.

18:46.367 --> 18:48.633
-OKAY. SO I'M GONNA
GIVE YOUR MOM THE CITATION,

18:48.733 --> 18:50.967
'CAUSE SHE'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR GETTING YOU DOWN TO COURT.

18:51.067 --> 18:53.367
OKAY? SHE'S ALREADY
BEEN EXPLAINED TO WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.267
-I'LL HAVE TO MISS WORK
BECAUSE OF YOU.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.967
-SORRY.
-YOU OWE YOUR MOM
AN APOLOGY I WOULD SAY, RIGHT?

18:58.067 --> 19:00.133
-YEAH.
-OKAY, I'M GONNA
TAKE THESE HAND--

19:00.233 --> 19:01.867
-WHEN WE GET HOME,
GONNA DO ALL MY DISHES
RIGHT NOW.

19:01.967 --> 19:03.333
-I'M GONNA TAKE
THESE HANDCUFFS OFF YOU.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.067
-ALL RIGHT.
-THIS IS THE END OF IT, RIGHT?

19:09.167 --> 19:11.900
-HOPEFULLY, YEAH.
-"HOPEFULLY"? THAT'S PROBABLY
NOT THE ANSWER YOU WANT TO GIVE.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.167
-WOULD'VE BEEN NICE
IF YOU GUYS WOULD'VE
LOCKED HIM UP FOR A DAY.

19:14.267 --> 19:16.333
-WELL, IN THE FUTURE,
THAT COULD HAPPEN TO YA.

19:16.433 --> 19:17.600
-THAT WOULD'VE SUCKED.

19:18.900 --> 19:20.933
-YOU DON'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN TO YOU, RIGHT?
-DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

19:21.067 --> 19:23.167
-THIS IS THE END OF IT, RIGHT?
-YEAH. (chuckles)

19:23.267 --> 19:26.067
-OKAY.
-YOU OWE YOUR MOM AN APOLOGY.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.500
-SORRY, MOM,
FOR BEING A DUMB-ASS...

19:28.600 --> 19:30.333
AND STUPID.
-SORRY FOR WHAT?

19:30.433 --> 19:33.567
-FOR DRINKING
UNDER THE AGE OF 21 AND...

19:33.667 --> 19:35.600
-FOR SHOVING BEER IN YOUR PANTS?

19:35.700 --> 19:37.500
-THAT TOO.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.067
-(sighs)
-ALL RIGHT. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

19:39.167 --> 19:41.633
IF YOU WERE WAITING ON HIM,
HE'S IN SOME TROUBLE.

19:41.733 --> 19:44.733
-(man laughs)
-HIS NIGHT'S OVER.

19:44.833 --> 19:46.600
-YEAH, I GUESS SO, HUH?

19:46.700 --> 19:49.200
MOM'S GOT HIM NOW, GUYS!

19:50.333 --> 19:51.400
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:51.500 --> 19:52.967
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.733
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:54.833 --> 19:55.967
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:56.067 --> 19:59.067
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:06.267 --> 20:07.867
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, WE'LL STILL SEND
A CODE THREE.

20:07.967 --> 20:09.667
-(theme music playing)
