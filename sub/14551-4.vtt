00:15.996 --> 00:17.503
Previously on Powers...

00:17.510 --> 00:19.013
We can't turn his powers off.

00:19.133 --> 00:20.989
- We can only retard them.
- Wolfe was this...

00:20.998 --> 00:24.123
rock-star philosopher badass.

00:24.243 --> 00:27.176
- Wolfe was our teacher.
- But you put Wolfe away.

00:27.181 --> 00:29.627
- Christian...
- He went crazy.

00:29.923 --> 00:32.420
- He killed my friends.
- Sway.

00:32.497 --> 00:33.800
It's a total boost.

00:33.828 --> 00:35.582
That's an unregulated Powers enhancer.

00:35.600 --> 00:36.500
My name's Zora.

00:36.578 --> 00:37.225
Zora.

00:37.548 --> 00:40.040
Your agent doesn't seem to
recognize your dead friend.

00:42.994 --> 00:45.680
You are one Powers pwning motherfucker.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.531
You know what they didn't
get right in this game?

00:47.573 --> 00:49.138
No regular people die.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.083
Retro Girl is not a person.

00:51.099 --> 00:54.091
She's the over-exposed image
that's being sold to you.

00:54.106 --> 00:56.903
- Do what you have to do
- You're coming with us. We are the police.

00:56.916 --> 00:58.292
OK? Enough of this.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.563
They can't take you away from your home.

01:02.132 --> 01:04.209
- You know how to get out of here?
- Yeah.

01:04.596 --> 01:05.984
I do.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.887
You came back for me.

01:33.801 --> 01:35.777
I thought you forgot me.

01:36.137 --> 01:37.748
I didn't forget.

01:38.012 --> 01:39.115
He ate them!

01:39.710 --> 01:41.183
He fuckin' ate those people.

01:41.224 --> 01:43.057
He fuckin' ate them!

01:43.177 --> 01:46.538
- Fuck! Fuck, fuck!
- They were hurting me.

01:47.256 --> 01:48.866
I know I shouldn't...

01:48.877 --> 01:51.630
but they've been hurting me for so long...

01:51.650 --> 01:54.290
I just wanted them to stop.

01:56.194 --> 01:57.567
I don't...

01:58.363 --> 02:00.833
I don't really like this...

02:02.702 --> 02:04.029
I...

02:04.548 --> 02:05.731
This...

02:06.082 --> 02:07.531
This isn't me.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.619
I'm not like this.

02:11.830 --> 02:12.972
See?

02:19.832 --> 02:21.327
I remember...

02:22.620 --> 02:24.074
things...

02:26.260 --> 02:27.334
Johnny...

02:29.215 --> 02:30.836
I'm so sorry.

02:34.223 --> 02:36.342
I never wanted to hurt...

02:36.676 --> 02:37.633
anyone.

02:43.237 --> 02:46.693
Synced and transcribed by chamallow

02:50.896 --> 02:52.723
Guess she fucked it up.

02:54.336 --> 02:56.488
No. It was me.

02:57.799 --> 02:59.103
I mean...

02:59.270 --> 03:02.369
Yeah, her standards were
impossible to live up to.

03:02.397 --> 03:07.031
Don't... get me wrong. I wanna hear as
much Retro Girl gossip as I can, but...

03:07.059 --> 03:09.143
I meant she fucked it up back there.

03:09.499 --> 03:12.255
You had Calista, she was right
there with you and that woman...

03:12.264 --> 03:13.464
she fucked it up.

03:15.214 --> 03:17.315
Jesus shit!

03:17.509 --> 03:19.216
Is there anything she won't sell?

03:20.888 --> 03:22.356
That's how you make a living.

03:22.767 --> 03:25.864
It's not like... being a
Power comes with a paycheck.

03:25.943 --> 03:29.529
Not a lot of high-paying jobs you can
walk into just 'cause you can fly, or

03:30.065 --> 03:31.408
walk through walls,

03:31.468 --> 03:32.940
bench-press five tons.

03:32.945 --> 03:35.198
Yeah I remember your Trojan ad.

03:35.429 --> 03:38.185
Yeah, that was my last endorsement deal.

03:38.354 --> 03:41.696
People aren't interested in buying
things from someone who's ordinary.

03:42.494 --> 03:44.026
That's not sexy.

03:44.095 --> 03:47.262
Yeah, us ordinary people.
We're a sorry bunch.

03:47.530 --> 03:48.580
I know a place.

03:49.035 --> 03:51.112
There'll be no one around to hurt you.

03:52.118 --> 03:53.499
No one for you.

03:54.989 --> 03:56.120
You'd be safe.

03:56.573 --> 03:58.451
I have to be there alone?

03:58.706 --> 04:00.109
It's cold there, and...

04:00.137 --> 04:01.392
and it's dark.

04:01.512 --> 04:03.881
But in the summertime,
the light comes and...

04:04.471 --> 04:07.015
and you won't believe
how many birds are there.

04:08.626 --> 04:09.734
Birds?

04:11.613 --> 04:13.279
I like birds.

04:13.584 --> 04:16.108
Unmasking, writing the book...

04:16.708 --> 04:18.831
it put me back on the radar for...

04:18.873 --> 04:20.012
fifteen minutes.

04:20.718 --> 04:23.382
And fuck Cross came looking when he did.

04:23.401 --> 04:25.584
Is that... why you became a cop?

04:25.839 --> 04:28.207
To keep off the convention circuit?

04:30.240 --> 04:31.971
Why did you become a cop?

04:32.433 --> 04:33.767
I mean besides...

04:33.808 --> 04:37.210
your dad trying to turn you
into the son he never had.

04:38.212 --> 04:40.418
I became a cop 'cause
I like helping people.

04:41.609 --> 04:44.439
And I like how... a new
day is never the same.

04:44.453 --> 04:46.927
And because my dad raised me
to be the son he never had.

04:46.941 --> 04:48.137
But fuck you anyway.

04:48.307 --> 04:49.009
Well...

04:49.415 --> 04:53.025
Cross needed a face to sell
Powers division to the voters.

04:53.791 --> 04:56.159
My face had recently become available...

04:56.229 --> 04:58.846
And I was always good at being famous.

04:58.896 --> 05:00.808
So it seemed like a good idea.

05:03.195 --> 05:05.110
Let's get you out of here, huh?

05:08.951 --> 05:10.299
Before we go...

05:10.737 --> 05:12.552
He hurt me.

05:12.912 --> 05:14.222
So much.

05:14.938 --> 05:17.168
And I am so hungry.

05:20.778 --> 05:21.854
No, no!

05:21.923 --> 05:22.689
No!

05:22.911 --> 05:24.273
You know you're better than that!

05:24.291 --> 05:25.574
You're more than that!

05:26.391 --> 05:28.007
Walker, this is Cross.

05:28.049 --> 05:29.023
I'm at the Shaft.

05:29.143 --> 05:31.266
Wolfe has escaped containment.

05:32.061 --> 05:33.787
What the fuck...

05:41.289 --> 05:42.946
Put Suppression Unit into Level 9.

05:42.965 --> 05:43.795
No.

05:44.147 --> 05:45.665
What happened? Was it Royalle?

05:45.688 --> 05:46.750
Not Royalle.

05:46.764 --> 05:48.602
Wolfe broke out of his restraints.

05:48.625 --> 05:50.582
Stage the unit outside his cell.

05:50.629 --> 05:52.475
The Lobotomy Team went in...

05:52.512 --> 05:54.305
He killed at least one of the guards.

05:54.315 --> 05:56.402
Suppression Unit's being dispatched.

05:56.464 --> 05:58.343
No, keep the unit out.

05:58.371 --> 05:59.908
Walker, it's Triphammer.

05:59.918 --> 06:02.069
- We have to send in the unit.
- Hartley?

06:02.120 --> 06:06.133
He'll just eat them and get more
powerful. If he's contained, we have time.

06:06.136 --> 06:08.573
We lost the cameras in
his cell, we're blind.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.162
He's already fed once...

06:11.170 --> 06:13.691
He's too powerful for a Suppression Unit.

06:14.031 --> 06:15.236
Kill me.

06:17.992 --> 06:20.198
I told you to kill me. You couldn't then.

06:21.320 --> 06:22.645
And now?

06:25.715 --> 06:27.755
Not easy to kill.

06:28.798 --> 06:30.778
Not the ones you love.

06:31.900 --> 06:33.349
Leave him alone.

06:35.045 --> 06:37.510
When we lost the cameras in his cell,

06:37.547 --> 06:38.913
there was a distortion.

06:38.973 --> 06:41.235
Royalle's powers signature.

06:41.825 --> 06:43.852
He didn't free Wolfe, but...

06:44.573 --> 06:46.160
We think he entered the cell.

06:46.219 --> 06:48.709
I have to know if Wolfe
is in his cell or at large.

06:48.722 --> 06:49.987
There are protocols.

06:50.054 --> 06:52.373
Send in the Suppression Unit.

06:59.916 --> 07:03.230
They're coming to hurt
me. I need to be strong.

07:03.249 --> 07:04.713
If you're not gonna kill me

07:04.727 --> 07:06.920
or let me go free, then...

07:27.901 --> 07:31.008
- Don't move!
- Hold it right there!

07:31.672 --> 07:33.463
Stay in position. Right there!

07:43.672 --> 07:44.673
_

07:44.683 --> 07:46.539
_

07:47.605 --> 07:48.669
Everything OK?

07:49.874 --> 07:51.568
Ha, it's just my mom.

07:52.578 --> 07:55.113
- Does she need you? Should you...
- No, it's cool.

07:55.163 --> 07:56.447
She's just... you know...

07:56.487 --> 07:58.306
No, she's been through a lot.

07:58.474 --> 07:59.777
With your dad and...

08:00.421 --> 08:01.824
All of that.

08:02.269 --> 08:03.384
It's cool, you know?

08:03.751 --> 08:05.498
Your mom needs you. You should go home.

08:07.521 --> 08:08.518
OK.

08:12.902 --> 08:14.292
I don't know which way to go.

08:15.603 --> 08:17.431
Go left, then all the way down,

08:17.449 --> 08:20.279
take a right at the van that
looks like Godzilla trampled it.

08:20.616 --> 08:22.762
All right. Well... later.

08:24.403 --> 08:25.403
Hey...

08:26.058 --> 08:27.941
Are you gonna give me your number or what?

09:01.099 --> 09:02.396
What do we do now?

09:04.053 --> 09:05.198
We leave now.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.525
We're packed up there.

09:07.843 --> 09:09.935
I'm the only one working. It'll be a mess.

09:10.503 --> 09:13.942
It doesn't matter. We're not
coming back. We're done. I'm fucked!

09:14.397 --> 09:16.628
- I've fucked it up.
- But we can fix it.

09:16.656 --> 09:20.432
No. No, no, no, Simons,
he's... he's awake now.

09:20.814 --> 09:22.997
I fucked up their schedule.

09:23.254 --> 09:26.266
I poked him in his fucking
brain too many times

09:26.290 --> 09:28.503
it made his powers harder to heal him.

09:28.694 --> 09:30.495
I've fucked it up.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.765
So we take a break.

09:36.153 --> 09:37.381
Recalibrate.

09:38.087 --> 09:40.594
No. No, no, no. We're
getting out of here now.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.436
Where's Calista?

09:47.808 --> 09:49.456
You're supposed to collect her.

09:49.775 --> 09:51.247
She wasn't there.

09:51.926 --> 09:53.915
Look, want me to stay here
and shut down the club?

09:54.469 --> 09:55.761
The girl shows up...

09:56.398 --> 09:57.752
I'll take care her.

10:05.933 --> 10:08.364
She's coming with us.

10:08.843 --> 10:12.683
I'm not gonna leave her
behind to fend for herself.

10:13.894 --> 10:15.631
I'll see you at the bar.

10:19.823 --> 10:23.448
He's contained on Level 9. All
personnel have been pulled out.

10:23.859 --> 10:27.987
- Any other Powers now on this level?
- General population starts on Level 8.

10:28.107 --> 10:30.921
- What went wrong, Harley?
- Powers are like muscles.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.302
The more you use them,
the stronger you get.

10:33.329 --> 10:36.467
We scheduled his lobotomies to
minimize the impact on his healing.

10:36.476 --> 10:37.979
So what did you miss?

10:38.099 --> 10:39.568
Bring up the video.

10:47.034 --> 10:48.467
Royalle.

10:48.945 --> 10:51.875
Each distortion lasts about 5 seconds,

10:51.914 --> 10:54.644
triggered by an electromagnetic
pulse at either end.

10:55.004 --> 10:56.087
Go back.

10:56.812 --> 10:58.367
Each teleport

10:58.403 --> 11:01.279
causes just enough distortion
to give him time in the cell.

11:01.297 --> 11:03.271
Completely unseen by us.

11:03.533 --> 11:05.679
Why didn't he just break Wolfe out?

11:05.706 --> 11:07.858
He's been inflicting more damage on Wolfe,

11:07.868 --> 11:09.692
'causing him to heal faster.

11:09.812 --> 11:11.450
How or why he's doing it?

11:11.804 --> 11:13.013
I don't have a fucking clue.

11:13.133 --> 11:15.193
He's been coming in here for months.

11:15.313 --> 11:16.498
I fear so.

11:17.660 --> 11:19.269
And you did not know?

11:20.949 --> 11:22.050
I did not.

11:22.170 --> 11:24.014
- I want to show you something.
- Well, hey,

11:24.021 --> 11:25.572
I know I'm the new guy here,

11:25.590 --> 11:27.592
but shouldn't we be calling
some Powers for help?

11:27.598 --> 11:30.033
- Yeah.
- The first name that comes to my mind is Retro Girl.

11:30.039 --> 11:31.458
She's right, we need help.

11:31.481 --> 11:32.405
No, we don't.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.204
Walker, we can do this ourselves.

11:35.257 --> 11:37.287
- Come see.
- Ourselves?

11:37.293 --> 11:39.093
He just ate six people.

11:39.117 --> 11:42.872
- If Wolfe gets out...
- We can contain him. I have a way.

11:46.311 --> 11:50.939
I'm in love with you. I
love you. Don't touch me!

11:53.477 --> 11:54.792
Turn it off.

11:57.424 --> 11:59.247
You need to get in front of this.

11:59.270 --> 12:00.701
Do some interviews.

12:00.736 --> 12:02.265
Damage control.

12:02.328 --> 12:04.053
I went there to shut him down.

12:04.094 --> 12:05.155
I failed.

12:05.346 --> 12:08.075
Anything I say now just
restarts the clock on the story.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.547
That's the show, Eva.

12:12.005 --> 12:16.022
But Hurricane Pulp is real, and that is
the only subject that I will address now.

12:17.261 --> 12:18.492
OK.

12:20.115 --> 12:21.142
Fine.

12:27.532 --> 12:31.462
Question is: has the iconic
Retro Girl passed her prime?

12:31.473 --> 12:34.553
Is she still relevant today?

12:36.747 --> 12:39.579
- This is ridiculous. What?
- People make mistakes, you know that.

13:02.245 --> 13:04.947
We can do it ourselves.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.369
What the fuck's going on?

13:10.245 --> 13:12.055
I called it "the Drainer".

13:12.346 --> 13:14.469
It takes away their powers.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.748
This isn't possible.

13:22.110 --> 13:23.331
How?

13:23.451 --> 13:27.024
That would take more time
than we have to explain.

13:27.520 --> 13:30.753
But I will tell you I got
the idea from you, Christian.

13:31.320 --> 13:34.045
Before Wolfe drained your powers...

13:34.165 --> 13:36.877
I would have never
imagined it could be done.

13:39.715 --> 13:42.594
I am such a fuck-up.

13:43.164 --> 13:45.732
Don't. Don't say that.

13:45.852 --> 13:48.167
That's not you saying that.

13:49.864 --> 13:51.161
Calista...

13:51.610 --> 13:53.462
We have to go.

13:53.582 --> 13:56.471
What? I... I don't wanna go.

13:56.591 --> 13:58.571
We have to go right now.

14:01.156 --> 14:04.271
You can't keep doing that. You
can't just grab me and take me

14:04.279 --> 14:06.401
somewhere without telling
me where you're going!

14:06.416 --> 14:09.214
- You'll be safe here. I'll be right back!
- Stop leaving me!

14:09.219 --> 14:12.031
- I don't have time to explain Calista.
- No!

14:12.194 --> 14:13.917
You do not get to abandon me.

14:14.195 --> 14:16.732
Not like your sister, not like Annabelle.

14:24.416 --> 14:26.914
There are four wings on each level

14:27.437 --> 14:31.114
Radiating from the elevator
core, which we know is secure.

14:31.124 --> 14:33.256
Each wing has a central core,

14:33.299 --> 14:35.639
with four spokes and two cells.

14:36.030 --> 14:39.620
We need to clear each wing, spoke by spoke.

14:39.828 --> 14:41.515
If you find Wolfe

14:41.635 --> 14:42.829
you retreat,

14:43.027 --> 14:46.348
you seal it in and you
wait for the rest of us.

14:46.383 --> 14:49.248
We will then try to drive
him back into his cell,

14:49.269 --> 14:51.946
where the Drainer will be set up.

14:51.980 --> 14:54.494
As soon as I get it up and
running, I'll join the search.

14:54.532 --> 14:57.703
Be aggressive, do not be
picky about your targets,

14:57.823 --> 15:00.709
don't wait for a head-shot,
he moves too quickly.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.010
Aim for his trunk,

15:02.044 --> 15:05.054
you want to inflict as much
damage as quickly as possible.

15:05.431 --> 15:08.292
We need to overwhelm his healing power.

15:08.766 --> 15:11.795
Is there any chance we get some fucking
backup with your security guards?

15:11.848 --> 15:15.338
No, we want to minimize
Wolfe's targets of opportunity.

15:15.342 --> 15:16.575
If shit gets fucked up,

15:16.618 --> 15:18.919
we don't want him to eat
too many people all at once.

15:19.122 --> 15:20.417
He can get too powerful.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.451
So we're portion control.

15:22.732 --> 15:25.550
- Well, the fucker's gonna choke on me.
- Got him!

15:25.564 --> 15:27.178
Heads up, he's moving guys.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.447
Wh... what's he looking for?

15:52.616 --> 15:54.670
He can sense the electricity.

15:54.790 --> 15:57.412
- He can what the fuck?
- No.

15:57.532 --> 16:00.500
The elevator runs off
on a generator, come on.

16:37.051 --> 16:38.443
OK.

16:38.986 --> 16:41.121
We're on backups now.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.014
So what changes then?

16:44.339 --> 16:46.242
It's generally darker.

16:46.759 --> 16:48.400
Thank you. And?

16:48.760 --> 16:52.786
And the primary seals to Level 8 are down.

16:53.307 --> 16:54.689
So?

16:55.678 --> 16:59.334
Which makes it easier for him to
find where the Powers are held.

17:00.595 --> 17:02.098
Oh, Jesus.

17:05.854 --> 17:08.425
We'll figure out what to do, where to go.

17:09.227 --> 17:10.954
I promise you that.

17:11.074 --> 17:13.734
But we can never go back there. Never.

17:14.031 --> 17:15.155
What do you mean?

17:15.275 --> 17:18.099
I've made a terrible...

17:18.220 --> 17:20.554
mistake, Calista.

17:21.619 --> 17:24.667
I've unleashed a monster
on the world, again.

17:24.669 --> 17:27.227
I don't understand what the
hell you're talking about.

17:27.444 --> 17:29.879
I'm talking about Sway.

17:30.398 --> 17:32.881
I'm talking about Wolfe.

17:33.287 --> 17:36.392
What? Wolfe... what you
have to do with Wolfe?

17:36.898 --> 17:39.158
I get Sway from Wolfe.

17:39.391 --> 17:40.878
He gives you Sway?

17:40.878 --> 17:42.472
But, he's in the Shaft...

17:42.708 --> 17:45.736
Sway is Wolfe.

17:45.964 --> 17:49.010
Wolfe has the unique
ability to absorb powers

17:49.044 --> 17:50.755
and to increase them exponentially.

17:50.795 --> 17:52.989
I thought I could  modify it, I thought

17:53.013 --> 17:54.951
I could change it on the molecular level.

17:54.970 --> 17:56.424
Ever so slightly.

17:57.807 --> 17:59.488
I thought it would allow

17:59.542 --> 18:02.683
people with limited powers
to reach their full potential.

18:02.929 --> 18:04.209
I thought...

18:05.756 --> 18:08.032
It doesn't matter what the fuck I thought,

18:08.080 --> 18:10.091
he's loose now.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.049
He's loose...

18:12.353 --> 18:14.431
because for the third time...

18:15.717 --> 18:17.785
I couldn't do what he begged me to do.

18:17.809 --> 18:18.836
Which was what?

18:19.418 --> 18:20.505
Kill him.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.584
He was like... a father to me.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.861
I dreamed of killing
my father so many times.

18:41.030 --> 18:42.386
I've killed...

18:42.630 --> 18:44.282
many people...

18:45.763 --> 18:48.822
without a flicker of regret. But not him.

18:50.527 --> 18:51.976
Not him.

18:54.159 --> 18:57.215
It's not easy to kill the ones you love.

19:00.483 --> 19:02.427
When I have my powers,

19:03.248 --> 19:06.053
the first thing I'm going
to do is find my father.

19:06.326 --> 19:08.177
And then I'm going to kill him.

19:09.082 --> 19:13.255
And for every time he laid a fist
on my mom, I will give him a hundred.

19:13.925 --> 19:15.491
And I'm not gonna cry.

19:15.948 --> 19:18.503
Not a single tear.

19:35.801 --> 19:37.713
I'll join you as soon as I can.

19:37.833 --> 19:39.894
Just make sure that fucking thing works.

19:40.124 --> 19:42.842
Just make sure you follow
the fucking plan this time.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.727
I only have one leg left.

19:46.622 --> 19:49.577
OK, people. Let's go.

20:13.244 --> 20:14.845
Entering spoke four.

20:14.965 --> 20:16.581
Copy that.

20:24.189 --> 20:29.195
- Six months, six months, six months...
- Shut up.

20:29.488 --> 20:31.529
You're gonna get me killed with you.

20:34.268 --> 20:36.292
Seriously, a crossbow?

20:36.307 --> 20:38.678
Took down El Chamuco with it in '98.

20:38.716 --> 20:41.035
I never leave home without it.

20:50.297 --> 20:51.951
How much longer, Harley?

20:52.517 --> 20:53.816
Soon.

20:57.460 --> 20:59.484
Have you gotten any dates?

21:00.096 --> 21:02.030
Have you even set up a profile?

21:02.035 --> 21:03.905
- No, I haven't.
- So you lied to me.

21:03.912 --> 21:08.512
- To get you off my fucking back.
- Dude, it's has been two years.

21:22.965 --> 21:24.499
Clear.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.200
Clear.

21:48.074 --> 21:51.897
- Ruth's single.
- Oh my god, you're pissing me off.

22:01.199 --> 22:03.830
- Clear.
- Closing.

22:41.593 --> 22:43.422
You're giving up, that's the problem.

22:43.871 --> 22:45.320
No, I haven't.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.725
When was the last time
you bought new clothes?

22:48.556 --> 22:49.499
Who cares?

22:49.515 --> 22:53.668
You've worn the same five outfits
in rotation for the last six months.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.473
What kind of person notices that?

22:55.903 --> 22:57.361
It's not just me, dude.

22:57.481 --> 22:59.014
Everybody notices.

22:59.588 --> 23:01.853
Exposed L is clear.
We're headed into the hub.

23:02.118 --> 23:03.243
Copy that.

23:03.749 --> 23:04.896
Wait...

23:05.841 --> 23:07.442
You guys talk about it?

23:12.289 --> 23:13.701
Did you hear that?

23:14.380 --> 23:16.623
Outer ring clear.

23:42.644 --> 23:44.674
- Golden's down. Golden's down.
- Kutter.

23:44.735 --> 23:46.288
What's your status?

23:46.753 --> 23:49.230
She's dead. Golden's dead.

23:59.618 --> 24:02.084
Do you have a location on Wolfe?

24:08.252 --> 24:10.584
Kutter? Kutter?

24:12.808 --> 24:14.259
Come on.

24:14.555 --> 24:16.384
We need to move. Let's go.

24:25.265 --> 24:27.099
It's not too late.

24:28.794 --> 24:30.318
Walker.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.810
I had to try.

24:33.930 --> 24:36.472
This shit is gonna kill you.

24:38.313 --> 24:42.146
- OK. OK, I got it.
- Get it off. Get it off...

24:49.395 --> 24:51.520
OK. OK. Wait.

24:51.714 --> 24:52.710
Deena.

24:53.412 --> 24:55.119
Wolfe begged us...

24:55.141 --> 24:56.773
me and Johnny...

24:56.893 --> 24:58.477
He begged us to kill him.

24:58.597 --> 24:59.719
And we didn't.

25:00.123 --> 25:03.026
I could have stopped him twenty years ago.

25:03.146 --> 25:05.118
I could have killed him.

25:11.762 --> 25:13.670
At the Sanction Lounge...

25:13.928 --> 25:16.836
Royalle saved dozens of people from Wolfe.

25:16.956 --> 25:18.933
I tried, but I couldn't do it.

25:18.975 --> 25:20.377
He was too strong.

25:20.497 --> 25:22.371
And then suddenly...

25:23.114 --> 25:24.467
He stopped.

25:25.989 --> 25:28.575
He stopped eating, stopped killing.

25:29.009 --> 25:30.961
And he started crying...

25:33.182 --> 25:34.927
He said...

25:36.609 --> 25:40.054
"Kill me... Christian."

25:41.682 --> 25:43.700
He bared his throat.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.710
And all those people,

25:45.740 --> 25:47.477
who've died later...

25:48.059 --> 25:49.781
I could have stopped him.

25:51.664 --> 25:53.988
But I captured Wolfe instead.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.201
Killers can't be heroes.

25:59.315 --> 26:02.418
Capturing Wolfe made me a hero.

26:03.385 --> 26:05.663
It made me famous.

26:06.359 --> 26:10.536
Like... like I knew it would!

26:13.321 --> 26:15.237
Walker's down.

26:15.575 --> 26:18.442
I'm moving on alone.

26:18.982 --> 26:22.336
- Deena...
- I don't need a fucking hero, Walker, I need a partner.

26:26.395 --> 26:28.448
What the fuck?

26:34.661 --> 26:36.554
Stay close.

27:01.255 --> 27:03.461
Time is up, Chaykin.

27:13.091 --> 27:15.863
Open the door! Open the door!

27:25.564 --> 27:28.690
That's why Shaft's administration
kept him isolated, right?

27:28.698 --> 27:31.967
Yes. The Powers population
at the Shaft is housed...

27:32.020 --> 27:33.666
I can be there in 10 minutes.

27:33.676 --> 27:36.672
It's just a media circus
going on outside the fence.

27:36.687 --> 27:38.741
We don't even know what's going on inside.

27:39.247 --> 27:42.318
You said if something
doesn't happen soon...

27:42.438 --> 27:45.009
Number one: there's no way
he's getting out of there.

27:45.009 --> 27:47.092
Number two: if they were
worried, they would have

27:47.102 --> 27:49.563
called in one of the bigs,
and I'd know about it.

27:49.578 --> 27:50.748
Number three:

27:50.758 --> 27:52.409
He eats people.

27:53.117 --> 27:54.803
You don't think I can do it?

27:54.839 --> 27:55.732
Look,

27:55.770 --> 27:59.327
Wolfe has taken down Powers with
years of experience in action. Just...

27:59.447 --> 28:02.844
- You... you get some battles on your belt...
- You work for me.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.912
Not the other way around.

28:05.167 --> 28:06.346
All right.

28:06.791 --> 28:08.559
Let me find out who's down there.

28:08.755 --> 28:11.148
This has gotta be your show, OK?

28:11.456 --> 28:12.711
I'll call you back.

28:14.121 --> 28:16.976
You said no one knew what your
cousin's death meant to you.

28:17.664 --> 28:20.427
Well, now all those Powers
at the club know your name.

28:20.465 --> 28:22.859
It's like psy ops, you
know, getting in their heads.

28:23.140 --> 28:24.994
Or I'm just lame. I don't know.

28:25.114 --> 28:26.049
No.

28:26.297 --> 28:27.339
No.

28:27.756 --> 28:28.806
I get it.

28:29.583 --> 28:30.742
It's cool.

28:32.675 --> 28:35.326
It... makes me feel special.

28:37.106 --> 28:38.308
Thank you.

28:40.928 --> 28:43.178
Were you scared with all of them around?

28:43.186 --> 28:44.066
No.

28:44.829 --> 28:46.239
It felt good...

28:46.359 --> 28:47.389
Exciting.

28:49.584 --> 28:51.422
Like what I did mattered.

28:51.432 --> 28:52.432
You know?

28:53.680 --> 28:55.075
I want to do more.

28:55.085 --> 28:56.227
You should.

28:56.410 --> 28:57.613
Like what?

28:58.549 --> 29:00.451
You did something for me,

29:00.679 --> 29:02.211
that I'll never forget.

29:02.221 --> 29:03.639
What if

29:03.759 --> 29:06.923
you know, you did something for you,

29:07.534 --> 29:08.628
for your dad,

29:08.638 --> 29:10.804
so that they'll never forget.

29:11.946 --> 29:13.515
Well, it has to be big.

29:14.064 --> 29:16.022
I want them to know that we're not weak.

29:16.068 --> 29:17.396
I can help you.

29:18.585 --> 29:19.549
How?

29:19.780 --> 29:22.394
I already told you. I got skills.

29:25.932 --> 29:27.543
Chaykin is down.

29:27.776 --> 29:29.997
Wolfe is sealed in spoke four.

29:30.012 --> 29:31.975
I'm in the outer ring, spoke four.

29:31.975 --> 29:33.444
If you drive him down the spoke,

29:33.487 --> 29:36.181
I can follow him back to the
central corridor, and into his cell.

29:36.193 --> 29:39.035
Hold that position,
Detective. I'm coming to you.

29:40.385 --> 29:42.483
We'll link up with you
both at the intersection.

29:42.493 --> 29:44.305
Kutter, what's your twenty?

29:44.530 --> 29:45.796
Kutter?

29:47.249 --> 29:48.767
It seems Kutter's down.

29:48.887 --> 29:51.356
Triphammer, we move on your signal.

29:51.476 --> 29:53.452
I've got Adlard and Zabriski with me.

29:53.482 --> 29:54.962
Adlard.

29:57.133 --> 29:59.259
No! Don't!

30:01.095 --> 30:04.975
- No more of my friends die.
- Don't! Walker, don't! No!

30:41.801 --> 30:43.326
Christian?

30:43.869 --> 30:45.379
Is that you?

30:46.925 --> 30:49.011
I thought I saw your fall.

30:49.810 --> 30:51.673
I thought it was a dream.

30:57.949 --> 30:59.920
Fucking fuckers.

31:01.194 --> 31:03.660
They threw you in here, too.

31:05.399 --> 31:07.275
But we're together now.

31:09.008 --> 31:10.770
We're trying to get out.

31:10.997 --> 31:14.025
They can't stop the both of us.

31:29.703 --> 31:31.224
Christian.

31:32.269 --> 31:35.353
Are you all right? What did they do to you?

31:35.864 --> 31:38.572
Fuck! We have to get out of here.

31:38.797 --> 31:40.809
They are trying to kill us.

31:41.120 --> 31:44.207
They don't know what we're capable of.

31:49.884 --> 31:54.413
Wolfe has killed and consumed
at least seven Shaft's guards.

31:54.433 --> 31:56.407
What does that mean for his powers?

31:56.417 --> 31:59.015
Wolfe gets stronger every time he feeds.

31:59.135 --> 32:02.308
But the real risk are are
incurred if he eats a Power.

32:02.428 --> 32:07.203
His tremendous baseline strength,
speed and regenerative abilities...

32:07.227 --> 32:09.174
will increase exponentially.

32:09.326 --> 32:11.094
This popped up on my feed.

32:11.101 --> 32:13.828
My source confirms Wolfe
has broken containment

32:13.850 --> 32:15.426
and is loose inside the Shaft.

32:15.428 --> 32:16.840
Powers Division is here,

32:16.855 --> 32:18.777
but their record in handling major Powers

32:18.819 --> 32:19.974
- is far from...
- You want me to call Triphammer

32:19.975 --> 32:20.875
and tell him you're coming?

32:21.101 --> 32:23.676
No, if there were any danger
of him reaching the surface,

32:23.677 --> 32:24.547
he would have called.

32:25.034 --> 32:27.870
The more people I help to
evacuate before this hurricane...

32:27.880 --> 32:30.335
the better. Keep me informed.

32:31.127 --> 32:32.381
Be careful.

32:42.846 --> 32:45.885
- Detective Pilgrim, what happened?
- Walker?

32:46.577 --> 32:48.065
Jesus, shit.

32:48.087 --> 32:49.152
Fuck.

32:49.174 --> 32:50.813
- Is he...
- What did Walker do?

32:51.001 --> 32:52.535
He went in...

32:53.003 --> 32:54.332
by himself.

32:54.718 --> 32:57.799
- Is he...
- No, he's not there. Neither is Wolfe.

32:58.028 --> 33:00.268
Wolfe has escaped containment into the ring,

33:00.268 --> 33:01.768
he could be anywhere on Level 9.

33:01.824 --> 33:03.180
Walker and Pilgrim?

33:03.198 --> 33:04.551
I've got eyes on Pilgrim.

33:04.606 --> 33:06.007
Walker is missing.

33:06.762 --> 33:08.362
- We're heading over to you.
- No.

33:08.387 --> 33:10.006
No, go back to Central Watch.

33:10.030 --> 33:13.360
The Drainer is activated in Wolfe's cell.
All I have to do is throw him in there.

33:13.643 --> 33:15.830
- We can cover more ground if we...
- Emile!

33:15.897 --> 33:17.129
For fuck's sake.

33:17.135 --> 33:18.966
Take your people out of
here before they get eaten.

33:19.021 --> 33:21.147
Copy. We're headed out.

33:21.649 --> 33:23.183
I'll escort you to the elevator.

33:23.201 --> 33:25.041
- Oh, the fuck you will.
- Detective!

33:25.052 --> 33:26.931
This is not a job for regular cops.

33:26.954 --> 33:28.925
Good thing we're not regular cops.

33:29.343 --> 33:31.092
If your partner's still alive...

33:31.123 --> 33:33.237
it's only because Wolfe wants him to be.

33:33.260 --> 33:34.423
If you go in there...

33:34.451 --> 33:35.713
You end up like Golden.

33:35.726 --> 33:38.197
Or Mack, or Chaykin, or Argento.

33:38.239 --> 33:40.041
You would be lunch.

33:40.045 --> 33:40.963
And trust me...

33:41.133 --> 33:42.879
he'll still want dinner.

33:47.619 --> 33:49.952
You've been in a lot of places.

33:51.226 --> 33:53.063
I've gotten good at hiding.

33:53.328 --> 33:54.662
But you came back...

33:54.672 --> 33:55.769
to your home.

33:58.468 --> 34:00.764
Why did you want to make Sway for the kids?

34:01.180 --> 34:05.160
'Cause it's a horrible
feeling being powerless.

34:05.869 --> 34:08.123
At someone else's mercy.

34:10.052 --> 34:11.569
But I fucked it up.

34:11.688 --> 34:13.304
It can still work.

34:13.504 --> 34:15.179
You have a bunch of Sway, right?

34:15.179 --> 34:16.701
- But now...
- Now...

34:16.944 --> 34:18.908
We have to hide.

34:21.280 --> 34:23.793
I'll go get Simons...

34:24.949 --> 34:27.427
We'll find some place safe...

34:27.775 --> 34:30.750
we'll gather our strength,
figure out a new strategy.

34:30.786 --> 34:31.873
And go where?

34:32.080 --> 34:34.455
Anywhere. Literally.

34:35.811 --> 34:38.076
- You choose.
- Johnny, no.

34:38.114 --> 34:39.813
There must be some place.

34:39.851 --> 34:41.188
You have to go back.

34:41.210 --> 34:42.742
You have to kill Wolfe.

34:42.862 --> 34:44.791
I don't think that's possible.

34:44.911 --> 34:46.475
You set him free!

34:46.489 --> 34:48.702
People are going to die.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.744
If I go back...

34:57.750 --> 34:59.975
If I do what needs to be done...

35:00.268 --> 35:02.930
if I come out of it alive...

35:04.733 --> 35:06.251
will you wait?

35:07.137 --> 35:08.364
Always.

35:09.037 --> 35:11.338
No matter what, no matter when.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.408
Thank you.

35:17.184 --> 35:19.502
Will you do something for me?

35:20.187 --> 35:22.900
I can't help you get your powers.

35:22.924 --> 35:24.375
No.

35:25.937 --> 35:28.612
I want you to help me to kill my father.

35:30.352 --> 35:32.258
I can do that.

35:32.759 --> 35:34.535
Then let's go home.

35:38.137 --> 35:39.798
Our home.

35:43.421 --> 35:45.014
Better.

35:45.681 --> 35:47.422
Everything's ready here.

35:47.876 --> 35:49.761
Change of plans.

35:49.881 --> 35:51.328
We're staying.

35:51.604 --> 35:53.948
No more running away, right?

35:54.068 --> 35:55.493
Yeah.

36:03.520 --> 36:05.283
Well, I'll get back to work, then.

36:05.403 --> 36:07.185
They caught him yet?

36:07.305 --> 36:08.767
Not yet.

36:13.292 --> 36:15.658
I have to go back.

36:17.098 --> 36:19.245
I shouldn't have left him behind.

36:31.113 --> 36:33.579
If Johnny was here, he could just...

36:34.063 --> 36:35.827
But he was here.

36:36.921 --> 36:40.943
He left me. Christian, I think he's...

36:40.961 --> 36:43.074
he's working with them, I think...

36:44.313 --> 36:46.510
He did something...

36:46.630 --> 36:47.945
to me.

37:32.322 --> 37:34.729
There's power here.

37:40.706 --> 37:43.101
Oh, fuck him, no!

38:16.486 --> 38:18.787
What the fuck...

38:29.134 --> 38:31.777
Go to the elevator. Go.

38:32.850 --> 38:34.270
Now!

38:38.499 --> 38:40.734
I found a unsealed hatch.

38:41.255 --> 38:43.203
He's on eight.

38:44.729 --> 38:45.879
If he eats...

38:45.923 --> 38:48.740
even a few significant Powers...

38:48.785 --> 38:50.650
he can become very strong.

38:50.998 --> 38:52.221
How strong?

38:52.756 --> 38:56.820
Strong enough to rip through
those gates like they were tinfoil.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.762
No, Landry. We need to get
a young face down there.

38:59.787 --> 39:03.410
Hey... what does Paola say about
her hottie in purple and black?

39:03.435 --> 39:05.907
Yeah, Zora, yeah, w... is she...

39:07.918 --> 39:10.532
Swear to fuck, Paola's an idiot!

39:10.570 --> 39:12.572
If I had Zora, I would
have her front and...

39:12.581 --> 39:15.217
It doesn't matter. She
doesn't have to do anything,

39:15.218 --> 39:16.850
just stand there and look badass.

39:17.056 --> 39:18.661
#Zora.

39:21.455 --> 39:24.145
- Hey. You OK?
- Yeah.

39:24.528 --> 39:25.976
I just, uh...

39:26.499 --> 39:28.355
I was thinking about you.

39:29.129 --> 39:30.649
But you just saw me.

39:30.903 --> 39:31.989
I know.

39:33.084 --> 39:36.218
- You just met me.
- I know.

39:36.901 --> 39:38.974
You're watching this thing at the Shaft?

39:39.521 --> 39:41.219
It's so fucked up.

39:41.339 --> 39:43.429
It makes me want to not be alone.

39:44.731 --> 39:45.874
Yeah?

39:46.998 --> 39:50.349
I... when I was a kid, I used
to have Wolfe nightmares.

39:50.693 --> 39:52.199
Really bad.

39:53.284 --> 39:55.701
Everybody's had a Wolfe nightmare.

39:58.322 --> 40:00.116
Get out of my way.

40:00.236 --> 40:03.250
- When I met you...
- I can use what's in there

40:03.287 --> 40:05.874
- to get us out of here.
- Do you remember me...

40:05.874 --> 40:07.253
teacher?

40:18.164 --> 40:19.278
You...

40:19.674 --> 40:20.613
were...

40:20.733 --> 40:22.110
lost.

40:24.358 --> 40:27.595
You were a cocky little shit.

40:28.851 --> 40:30.091
Yeah, we...

40:30.865 --> 40:34.846
We didn't know. Me, Johnny, all of us...

40:34.861 --> 40:36.843
We didn't know who we were,

40:36.880 --> 40:39.033
what we could be.

40:40.222 --> 40:42.959
No, this, this isn't you.

40:43.271 --> 40:46.103
This is not who you are.

40:57.075 --> 41:00.839
You are working with
them, making me see things.

41:00.861 --> 41:02.996
You cannot do it Christian,

41:02.999 --> 41:06.361
you cannot turn me into something I am not!

41:14.407 --> 41:15.860
I...

41:16.379 --> 41:17.936
am...

41:18.373 --> 41:20.179
power.
