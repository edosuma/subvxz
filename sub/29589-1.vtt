00:10.008 --> 00:12.758
(dramatic music)

00:44.310 --> 00:46.893
(wind howling)

01:21.002 --> 01:23.169
(panting)

01:48.391 --> 01:51.141
(gunshot firing)

03:07.057 --> 03:09.224
(sighing)

04:44.286 --> 04:46.428
- What about this?

04:46.428 --> 04:47.450
- No.

04:47.450 --> 04:49.220
- Well, you need to do something!

04:49.220 --> 04:50.870
- I'm fine.

04:50.870 --> 04:53.443
- Sitting inside all the time is not fine.

05:12.510 --> 05:14.760
You'd just be bored anyway.

05:19.150 --> 05:20.450
You know your Grandma's real happy

05:20.450 --> 05:21.900
that you're staying with her.

05:28.010 --> 05:29.940
You guys can take selfies

05:29.940 --> 05:31.832
and text emoji's to each other.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.582
(brooding music)

06:06.790 --> 06:10.510
- Are you hungry dear?
- Yeah!

06:10.510 --> 06:12.060
- Okay, I'll start dinner then.

06:13.070 --> 06:14.210
- No fish though grandma!

06:14.210 --> 06:15.875
I hate fish.

06:15.875 --> 06:16.708
- Right!

06:34.920 --> 06:36.920
I see you found my journals.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.270
- Why do you write in them?

06:40.057 --> 06:44.760
- Hm, well it's where I keep

06:44.760 --> 06:49.593
my thoughts, and my ideas and my feelings.

06:50.900 --> 06:53.833
You can figure things out
when you write them down.

06:56.110 --> 06:57.123
This one's for you.

07:00.950 --> 07:01.979
Oh fun.

07:01.979 --> 07:04.229
(laughing)

07:11.032 --> 07:13.080
- [Radio host] Tensions are
rising as the prime minister

07:13.080 --> 07:14.770
of Canada, president of the United States,

07:14.770 --> 07:16.770
and Mexico are in their 3rd day of talks

07:16.770 --> 07:17.790
with North Korea.

07:17.790 --> 07:20.240
The talks are centered around
an on going nuclear test

07:20.240 --> 07:22.310
being carried out by the
North Korean military.

07:22.310 --> 07:24.210
Kim Jong-un has stated that North Korea

07:24.210 --> 07:25.740
desires to be a nuclear power

07:25.740 --> 07:28.810
only to level the playing
field and promote peace.

07:28.810 --> 07:30.350
It is hoped that a
resolution will be found

07:30.350 --> 07:31.840
by the end of the week.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.767
Tonight's weather will be
clear with (speech fades).

07:47.559 --> 07:49.976
- I just got a text from Dad.

07:51.310 --> 07:53.313
- Those cell phones really amaze me.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.510
We'd be lost without them, wouldn't we?

07:57.410 --> 07:59.260
- Did you text when you were younger?

08:00.285 --> 08:03.253
- We didn't even have cell phones my dear.

08:05.490 --> 08:06.623
- Okay grandma.

08:07.577 --> 08:08.577
- We didn't.

08:22.017 --> 08:25.017
(explosion banging)

08:29.564 --> 08:30.397
Oh my!

08:32.100 --> 08:33.526
What the heck.

08:33.526 --> 08:34.443
Oh darn it.

08:41.590 --> 08:43.616
Oh I got nothing here.

08:43.616 --> 08:44.449
Come on.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.780
Just had it fixed.

09:14.180 --> 09:17.060
- [Girl] How much further
to your apartment Grandma?

09:17.060 --> 09:18.224
- [Grandma] Walking?

09:18.224 --> 09:19.293
I don't know dear.

09:20.220 --> 09:21.663
Few hours I suppose.

09:24.170 --> 09:25.003
- Oh good.

09:59.557 --> 10:00.390
Grandma?

10:18.545 --> 10:19.378
Grandma?

10:21.978 --> 10:24.978
(doorknob jiggling)

10:29.740 --> 10:32.290
- I went down to the store
to pick up a few things.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.510
Joe at the grocery store let

10:35.510 --> 10:36.660
me in the back.

10:36.660 --> 10:38.410
Showed him some cash and in I went.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.160
The whole town is locked up.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.973
No phones, no street lights, no cars.

10:48.030 --> 10:49.423
Doesn't make any sense.

10:50.960 --> 10:53.160
Would you like some
eggs for breakfast dear?

10:54.373 --> 10:55.206
Okay.

10:58.170 --> 10:59.003
- Are you okay?

11:02.560 --> 11:04.683
- Just the old pacemaker acting up.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.593
I'll be fine.

11:27.910 --> 11:30.660
- How's dad supposed to get home?

11:32.780 --> 11:36.933
- By car or plane I suppose.

11:40.110 --> 11:43.393
Well I'm sure everything's
working where he is.

11:45.720 --> 11:46.770
- What if it's not?

11:46.770 --> 11:48.023
He's really far away.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.560
- Your dad will find a way Niamh.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.343
He's really good that way.

12:03.220 --> 12:04.653
How are your eggs?

12:06.470 --> 12:07.303
- They're fine.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.753
Grandma, that's not enough.

12:33.150 --> 12:36.873
- Well, it'll do until help comes.

12:41.000 --> 12:41.990
And...

12:52.840 --> 12:54.890
Your dad dropped this off a while back.

13:00.305 --> 13:03.222

13:46.432 --> 13:49.099
Go check that I locked the door!

13:56.577 --> 13:58.176
- The door's locked.

13:58.176 --> 14:01.620
- That's good dear.

14:01.620 --> 14:03.440
Let's make some tea.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.817
Would you fill the kettle?

14:22.547 --> 14:24.071
- Grandma?

14:24.071 --> 14:24.904
Grandma?

14:29.223 --> 14:31.890
(heart beating)

15:35.042 --> 15:37.709

15:47.407 --> 15:49.062

November 3.

18:30.570 --> 18:31.950
Grandma died.

18:31.950 --> 18:33.180
I'm alone.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.890
It's been 10 days since the EMP.

18:35.890 --> 18:38.890
That means Electro Magnetic Pulse.

18:38.890 --> 18:42.810
Nothing works except for
some old flashlights.

18:42.810 --> 18:45.290
Dad told me it could happen one day.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.840
I don't know where he is.

18:46.840 --> 18:48.640
Things are crazy outside.

21:06.611 --> 21:07.444
Anyone?

21:12.440 --> 21:15.357

21:24.780 --> 21:26.700
- December 15th.

21:26.700 --> 21:27.923
I'm so thirsty.

21:29.380 --> 21:31.330
I don't see anyone around town anymore.

21:32.330 --> 21:34.420
A bunch of people left a few nights ago

21:35.480 --> 21:36.893
because of the crazy man.

21:37.850 --> 21:39.373
He's taking everyone's food.

21:40.390 --> 21:42.253
Well what's left of it.

21:46.900 --> 21:50.653
I have three weeks of
food left, and no water.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.850
Dad showed me the emergency
stash that's buried

21:54.850 --> 21:56.473
in a field near the house.

22:01.490 --> 22:03.400
He knew this would happen.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.050
He's supposed to be here with me.

Yeah it's for you.

25:07.990 --> 25:10.360
Oh I didn't get you anything.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.683

25:44.440 --> 25:47.230
This is a great little tool for survival.

25:47.230 --> 25:48.280
You should take this.

Damn.

29:44.730 --> 29:46.670
- December 28.

29:46.670 --> 29:48.560
It was an exciting day today.

29:48.560 --> 29:51.943
I left the apartment and I
was chased by the crazy men.

29:53.097 --> 29:56.793
I ate frozen worms and I'm
staying in an old boathouse.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.503
I need to get to Dad's emergency supplies.

30:01.570 --> 30:04.143
I just don't know how
to get there exactly.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.225
Is anyone home?

(sad brooding music)

31:21.352 --> 31:24.185
(dramatic music)

31:31.844 --> 31:33.653
- [Male] Hey, that's far enough!

31:37.280 --> 31:39.010
I don't have food for ya!

31:39.010 --> 31:41.430
I have just enough for
my family and that's it.

31:41.430 --> 31:43.453
You need to turn around and leave now.

31:45.020 --> 31:46.431
Now!

35:06.126 --> 35:06.959
Who's there?

35:06.959 --> 35:08.172
I'm down in the basement

35:08.172 --> 35:09.005
I'm trapped.

35:09.005 --> 35:10.220
Please come help me.

35:10.220 --> 35:11.470
Please, please.

35:39.330 --> 35:40.820
Hello?

35:40.820 --> 35:42.480
Please help me, I'm trapped in here.

35:42.480 --> 35:43.313
There's something blocking the door,

35:43.313 --> 35:44.146
I don't know what.

35:44.146 --> 35:44.979
It won't open.

35:45.910 --> 35:47.933
Please just pull it away whatever it is.

35:51.860 --> 35:53.270
Oh thank god.

35:53.270 --> 35:54.905
Oh thank you.

35:54.905 --> 35:57.556
Oh my god I've been trapped here for days.

35:57.556 --> 35:58.433
I can't see a thing.

36:05.082 --> 36:05.915
Thank you.

36:07.861 --> 36:09.278
- You're welcome.

36:21.610 --> 36:22.693
- Whoa, whoa.

36:24.528 --> 36:26.361
Okay, it's just, here.

36:40.131 --> 36:41.298
Are you alone?

37:18.498 --> 37:20.593
When do you think the
power will come back on?

37:24.490 --> 37:25.323
- It won't.

37:26.630 --> 37:27.713
Everything is fried.

37:32.800 --> 37:34.313
- There's no help?

37:41.270 --> 37:43.060
Then we're a team

37:46.460 --> 37:49.053
- Sure a team.

38:03.090 --> 38:04.440
- Remember what I told you,

38:05.474 --> 38:07.924
when the food runs out
people will get desperate.

38:08.960 --> 38:11.183
They'll wanna take your
clothes, your food.

38:12.053 --> 38:14.350
You have to be careful who you can trust.

38:14.350 --> 38:15.453
- How can I tell?

38:16.552 --> 38:18.590
- You'll be able to tell,

38:18.590 --> 38:19.850
just look in their eyes.

38:19.850 --> 38:20.683
You can feel it.

38:25.890 --> 38:27.440
Your mum was real good at that.

38:39.970 --> 38:41.323
- I saved someone today.

38:42.370 --> 38:43.810
A boy.

38:43.810 --> 38:45.520
His name is William.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.993
I looked into his eyes, I trusted my gut.

38:49.340 --> 38:51.803
We have one or two months of food I think.

38:52.700 --> 38:53.963
It's so cold.

38:54.875 --> 38:55.708
I hate winter!

39:25.730 --> 39:26.563
- How much?

39:29.082 --> 39:31.050
- 50, 60 days worth.

39:31.050 --> 39:32.400
- I thought there was more.

39:34.150 --> 39:35.080
- Are we close?

39:35.080 --> 39:35.913
- Not Really.

39:36.848 --> 39:37.681
We're here,

39:38.700 --> 39:41.353
supplies are here.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.470
- Is there a place called Lang?

39:49.870 --> 39:50.703
- Lang?

39:55.890 --> 39:58.430
No, why what's there?

39:58.430 --> 40:01.020
- My dad says there's a group
of people who are ready,

40:01.020 --> 40:01.963
for what happened.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.170
- What do you mean ready?

40:05.660 --> 40:08.780
- They can grow food, cook, stay warm

40:08.780 --> 40:10.653
live, without electricity.

40:12.090 --> 40:14.430
- And you think they'll take us?

40:14.430 --> 40:15.263
- I think so.

40:27.100 --> 40:27.933
- Eight's.

40:29.920 --> 40:30.753
- Go fish.

40:33.770 --> 40:34.733
Any sixes.

40:40.370 --> 40:41.620
- Where are your parents?

40:43.090 --> 40:47.063
- My dad is in a conference in Texas,

40:49.820 --> 40:53.713
and my mom, she passed
away a couple of years ago.

40:54.640 --> 40:55.473
You?

40:58.530 --> 41:01.283
- We got separated, I
don't know where they are.

41:05.890 --> 41:07.240
Two's?

41:07.240 --> 41:08.073
- Yep.

41:08.073 --> 41:08.906
Five's?

41:13.240 --> 41:16.780
- I'm tired, gonna get some sleep.

41:16.780 --> 41:17.613
- Okay.

41:21.745 --> 41:24.328
(wind howling)

41:39.920 --> 41:43.003
(sad brooding music)

43:05.813 --> 43:08.660
This is what animals must feel like.

43:08.660 --> 43:10.483
We're bored and Cold.

43:11.360 --> 43:13.543
All we do is think about food and water.

43:14.480 --> 43:16.180
How to save it.

43:16.180 --> 43:17.376
Where to find it.

43:17.376 --> 43:18.753
Who will steal it.

43:53.390 --> 43:55.223
Hey Will, come look at this.

44:01.494 --> 44:02.670
- What's this?

44:02.670 --> 44:03.770
- My hat.

44:03.770 --> 44:04.920
Look at these, clothes.

44:16.810 --> 44:18.260
Oh here's like a hunting one.

44:20.980 --> 44:22.579
- This is awesome.

44:22.579 --> 44:24.605
- This is like a murderers hat.

44:24.605 --> 44:26.083
- Park Ranger.

44:29.600 --> 44:30.753
- Oh look at this.

44:38.825 --> 44:41.414
- My sister and I used to do this.

44:41.414 --> 44:43.747
(sad music)

46:09.290 --> 46:12.040
(birds chirping)

46:13.270 --> 46:14.903
I miss my video games.

46:16.100 --> 46:19.003
- I miss restaurants.
- And TV.

46:20.090 --> 46:22.723
- And my phone.
- Playing hockey.

46:23.710 --> 46:24.543
- My bed.

46:30.000 --> 46:30.833
How far?

46:36.903 --> 46:37.940
- Hm, not sure.

46:37.940 --> 46:39.370
- I thought you could read it!

46:39.370 --> 46:40.203
- I can!

46:41.348 --> 46:44.123
We're somewhere between
here and here, okay?

46:48.150 --> 46:49.793
Sorry, I'm just really hungry.

47:14.470 --> 47:16.003
- This was a horrible idea.

47:17.860 --> 47:19.153
Maybe we should go back.

47:21.132 --> 47:22.493
- We need that food.

47:29.284 --> 47:30.350
- Where are you going?

47:30.350 --> 47:31.350
- We need more wood.

47:38.378 --> 47:41.045
(ominous music)

47:44.514 --> 47:46.931
(scratching)

47:51.290 --> 47:56.290
(ominous music)
(coyotes yelping)

47:57.629 --> 47:59.097
- Will.

47:59.097 --> 47:59.930
Will.

48:01.398 --> 48:02.231
Will.

48:05.369 --> 48:06.202
Will.

48:19.261 --> 48:21.740
- Were those coyotes or wolves?

48:21.740 --> 48:22.590
- Does it matter?

48:37.230 --> 48:39.320
Why not just leave it at home?

48:39.320 --> 48:41.310
- Because they can find it.

48:41.310 --> 48:43.170
And if you have to leave
the house in a hurry

48:43.170 --> 48:44.273
you've got a plan B.

49:13.418 --> 49:14.893
- Hey, check this out.

49:27.880 --> 49:29.343
I love these old cars.

49:39.070 --> 49:39.903
Come on.

49:46.480 --> 49:47.313
Hop in!

49:57.297 --> 49:59.643
- How do you even open this thing?

50:03.830 --> 50:05.083
- Check this out.

50:24.200 --> 50:25.033
- No.

50:26.410 --> 50:27.450
No.

50:27.450 --> 50:28.453
- Come on.

50:29.340 --> 50:30.750
- Fine.

50:30.750 --> 50:31.750
It's not gonna work.

50:32.950 --> 50:33.950
It's not gonna work.

50:35.485 --> 50:38.340
(engine roaring)

50:38.340 --> 50:39.640
It's not supposed to work!

50:41.111 --> 50:42.397
- Uh-huh.

50:43.427 --> 50:46.203
- You can't even drive.
- Watch me.

50:50.746 --> 50:53.413
(upbeat music)

51:54.231 --> 51:55.064
- Ah no!

51:55.920 --> 51:58.912
- What, come on, there
are no rules anymore.

51:58.912 --> 52:00.330
- Nah.

52:00.330 --> 52:03.100
- Come on, look, it's so easy.

52:03.100 --> 52:06.943
Gas, brake, and this is steering.

52:12.140 --> 52:13.653
Come on.

52:17.640 --> 52:18.492
- Why not.

52:18.492 --> 52:21.075
(upbeat music)

52:33.171 --> 52:34.338
- Doing great.

53:04.910 --> 53:05.743
Hey.

53:10.880 --> 53:12.280
- How far 'til we get there?

53:13.840 --> 53:16.403
- Well, it's gonna be
a lot faster on wheels.

53:17.780 --> 53:18.980
How much gas do we have?

53:19.830 --> 53:20.803
- Not enough.

53:22.632 --> 53:24.120
Where does the gas even go?

53:24.120 --> 53:24.953
- Here.

53:31.497 --> 53:33.340
- Oh.

53:33.340 --> 53:34.930
- I think you should drive.

53:34.930 --> 53:37.696
- Yeah, we need to get
there sometime this year.

53:37.696 --> 53:39.673
- Ha, ha, hilarious.

53:46.290 --> 53:47.443
- All good.
- Okay.

54:03.250 --> 54:04.083
This isn't it.

54:05.360 --> 54:06.193
- What?

54:07.610 --> 54:09.763
- This road is flat, it should have hills.

54:12.240 --> 54:13.700
- This is the 9th line right?

54:13.700 --> 54:18.700
- Yeah, the 9th line of Douro.

54:18.722 --> 54:21.778
- Well is there another 9th line?

54:21.778 --> 54:22.611
- Um,

54:28.480 --> 54:30.302
there's a 9th line of Smith?

54:30.302 --> 54:31.483
Could that be it?

54:32.413 --> 54:34.623
- Ah, it's all the way back.

54:35.740 --> 54:37.100
- The other way.
- Yip.

54:40.010 --> 54:40.843
- All right.

54:51.760 --> 54:56.760
Rolled up crepes with lemon
juice and piles of sugar.

54:57.960 --> 54:59.243
Those are the best.

55:00.480 --> 55:04.223
- Lasagna, hot melted
cheese with tomato sauce!

55:07.380 --> 55:11.920
- Pizza, lots of cheese, pepperoni,

55:11.920 --> 55:15.253
and those little spicy meatball things.

55:17.950 --> 55:18.813
- So hungry.

55:44.530 --> 55:45.363
- Oof.

55:46.500 --> 55:47.333
Jackpot.

55:54.340 --> 55:56.470
Hey, find anything?
- Hey, nope.

55:56.470 --> 55:57.820
The houses are cleaned out.

56:00.160 --> 56:02.240
- This may help for food.

56:02.240 --> 56:03.430
- Yummy.

56:03.430 --> 56:04.413
- Better than nothing.

56:11.400 --> 56:13.153
Ha, dinner.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.893
All right give me your knife.

56:37.455 --> 56:38.288
All set.

56:48.500 --> 56:50.583
I thought you hated fish.

56:51.680 --> 56:53.363
- I'm making an exception today.

57:09.070 --> 57:09.903
- Right here?

57:12.500 --> 57:13.333
- Yep.

57:38.150 --> 57:38.983
Wait stop.

57:38.983 --> 57:39.816
It's here, we're here.

57:44.780 --> 57:46.023
- Well wait for me.

57:49.330 --> 57:50.163
Niamh.

57:54.100 --> 57:54.933
Niamh.

58:02.510 --> 58:03.843
- Over here I found it.

58:08.850 --> 58:10.343
- Is that it?
- Yep.

58:25.350 --> 58:27.983
- What do we eat?
- I don't know.

58:28.960 --> 58:29.793
You pick.

58:44.700 --> 58:45.600
- Where's the gun?

58:53.115 --> 58:54.115
Whoa.
- Yeah.

59:07.820 --> 59:12.523
Food options, canned beans or granola bar.

59:17.370 --> 59:18.620
- I know what I'm having.

59:19.750 --> 59:20.583
- Okay.

59:36.286 --> 59:39.119
- Oh yeah, found this in the pack.

59:43.650 --> 59:46.270
If separated go here and wait for me!

59:46.270 --> 59:47.103
Dad.

59:54.172 --> 59:56.172
We'll go in the morning.

59:57.840 --> 1:00:00.134
- Do you think he'll be there?

1:00:00.134 --> 1:00:03.023
- Yeah, he will.

1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:06.660
- We'll find your family too Will.

1:00:10.912 --> 1:00:11.745
- No.

1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:15.833
We won't.

1:00:22.270 --> 1:00:23.270
They're not missing.

1:00:27.300 --> 1:00:29.000
They were coming to pick me up and

1:00:30.824 --> 1:00:33.023
it was a bad car accident.

1:00:35.590 --> 1:00:38.020
The doctors were working on them

1:00:38.020 --> 1:00:42.003
and then the power went out.

1:00:43.070 --> 1:00:44.453
Emergency power too.

1:00:48.340 --> 1:00:49.173
It's just me.

1:00:55.613 --> 1:00:57.030
- I'm sorry Will.

1:01:02.765 --> 1:01:04.007
- Hey.
- Will.

1:01:04.007 --> 1:01:04.840
Will.

1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:07.590
(dramatic music)

1:01:40.263 --> 1:01:42.930
(ominous music)

1:02:15.178 --> 1:02:18.011
(muffled talking)

1:02:59.552 --> 1:03:01.052
- Yip she's awake.

1:03:05.911 --> 1:03:08.578
(ominous music)

1:03:34.190 --> 1:03:35.640
- Whole world's gone to shit.

1:03:41.060 --> 1:03:42.483
We need survivors like you.

1:03:47.860 --> 1:03:48.763
I got a plan.

1:03:50.974 --> 1:03:51.874
A plan to rebuild.

1:03:54.143 --> 1:03:57.226
(car hooter tooting)

1:04:17.620 --> 1:04:18.453
- Will.

1:04:20.013 --> 1:04:21.473
How did you find me?

1:04:23.017 --> 1:04:24.417
- I followed the car lights.

1:04:35.721 --> 1:04:37.560
- Where are you going?

1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:38.570
- I'll get the food, you go.

1:04:38.570 --> 1:04:39.990
- Forget the food, lets go!

1:04:39.990 --> 1:04:41.510
- No, I'll be right behind you I swear.

1:04:41.510 --> 1:04:42.343
- Oh fine.

1:04:45.310 --> 1:04:49.207
- Jesus Christ, sit down, stay put.

1:05:09.507 --> 1:05:10.942
- Go.

1:05:10.942 --> 1:05:13.609
(ominous music)

1:05:53.406 --> 1:05:56.156
(gunshot firing)

1:09:03.287 --> 1:09:05.470
(gunshots firing)

1:09:05.470 --> 1:09:06.303
- Nice!

1:09:11.270 --> 1:09:13.633
- Oh, right.

1:09:17.790 --> 1:09:20.133
So, why are we doing this again?

1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:24.000
- I just want you to be familiar with it.

1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:25.903
Just in case things go bad one day.

1:09:27.060 --> 1:09:31.603
It probably won't, but it's possible.

1:09:41.380 --> 1:09:44.463
(car engine roaring)

1:10:30.457 --> 1:10:33.207
(ominous music)

1:11:34.837 --> 1:11:35.837
- Seriously?

1:11:37.650 --> 1:11:39.120
- The head?

1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:41.960
- No the heart, the lungs!

1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:43.520
The head is all bone.

1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:45.110
The bullet will just ricochet off.

1:11:45.110 --> 1:11:47.010
That'll leave it bleeding and in pain.

1:11:48.190 --> 1:11:49.100
- Well, I don't think I'm gonna be

1:11:49.100 --> 1:11:52.570
shooting anything anytime soon.

1:11:52.570 --> 1:11:54.486
- All right probably not.

1:11:54.486 --> 1:11:56.483
But I'm just trying to
tell you how it's done.

1:12:22.427 --> 1:12:25.510
(car engine roaring)

1:14:00.369 --> 1:14:02.286
- Mom.
- Niamh I'm here.

1:14:04.091 --> 1:14:04.924
- Mom?

1:14:05.820 --> 1:14:06.653
Don't go.

1:14:55.971 --> 1:14:57.138
- Niamh.
- Mom.

1:14:58.038 --> 1:15:00.871
(muffled talking)

1:15:29.651 --> 1:15:31.984
(sad music)

1:16:24.329 --> 1:16:27.079
(dramatic music)

1:16:54.307 --> 1:16:57.057
(gunshot firing)

1:17:14.183 --> 1:17:16.516
(sad music)

1:17:51.357 --> 1:17:53.607
(coughing)

1:18:12.864 --> 1:18:13.697
Will.

1:18:40.650 --> 1:18:42.193
Saved your ass again.

1:18:44.560 --> 1:18:45.393
- Whatever.

1:18:59.730 --> 1:19:01.230
- I haven't written in awhile.

1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:03.910
Will and I almost didn't make it.

1:19:05.550 --> 1:19:06.553
The car died on us.

1:19:08.090 --> 1:19:10.640
We ended up walking the
rest of the way to LANG.

1:19:10.640 --> 1:19:12.853
Sleeping in abandon houses.

1:19:12.853 --> 1:19:15.763
And of course, no food anywhere.

1:19:16.910 --> 1:19:18.810
A lot of people died.

1:19:18.810 --> 1:19:21.990
They just didn't know what to do.

1:19:21.990 --> 1:19:24.110
Or where to go to survive.

1:19:24.110 --> 1:19:25.423
But we made it.

1:19:27.010 --> 1:19:29.270
The people here knew who Dad was.

1:19:29.270 --> 1:19:31.020
They gave Will and I place to stay.

1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:33.853
It's like a mini community here.

1:19:34.940 --> 1:19:36.320
They have clean water,

1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:39.920
live stock, gardens, a place to sleep,

1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:42.420
clothing and all the things
you need for survival.

1:19:43.690 --> 1:19:45.440
Everyone has a job.

1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:47.883
I look after the ducks and
chickens in the morning.

1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:52.430
I volunteer to keep watch too.

1:19:52.430 --> 1:19:54.830
People try to raid the
place for food sometimes.

1:19:56.400 --> 1:19:58.130
I haven't seen Will much.

1:19:58.130 --> 1:19:59.343
He keeps to himself.

1:20:00.600 --> 1:20:02.603
Maybe he needs time after what happened.

1:20:04.404 --> 1:20:06.273
I wonder if you're still out there Dad.

1:20:07.437 --> 1:20:08.270
Alive.

1:20:11.564 --> 1:20:14.314
(ominous music)

1:21:04.631 --> 1:21:05.464
Dad.

1:21:09.342 --> 1:21:10.435
Dad.

1:21:10.435 --> 1:21:13.185
(soothing music)
