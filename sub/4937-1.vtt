02:52.484 --> 02:54.782
Typewriters, transcripts, 
anything missing?

02:55.120 --> 02:57.281
The key to the ladies room.

03:13.638 --> 03:15.731
Where was the fecal material found?

03:16.007 --> 03:19.135
In the corner.
You'll know when you're near it.

03:19.711 --> 03:22.441
- This was mailed to me.
- Just a minute.

03:22.514 --> 03:25.813
If you don't have a telephone,
bring in a gas bill.

03:26.084 --> 03:28.416
We need proof that you live 
in the district.

03:29.020 --> 03:33.320
I'm Jaime Escalante.
I'm supposed to teach Computer Science.

03:33.525 --> 03:35.015
We don't have computers.

03:38.063 --> 03:42.432
We were supposed to get computers,
but there's no funding for them again.

03:43.034 --> 03:46.003
I'm Raquel Ortega,
chairman of the math department.

03:46.071 --> 03:47.538
We'll be working together.

03:48.273 --> 03:52.334
You don't understand.
I was supposed to teach computers.

03:57.349 --> 03:59.840
- Where were you last night?
- Where was I?

04:00.118 --> 04:02.609
"Where was I?" I was waiting.

04:03.555 --> 04:05.546
You the new teacher?

04:05.957 --> 04:07.618
Please find a seat.

04:10.195 --> 04:11.856
What are we doing today?

04:12.397 --> 04:14.763
Will everyone please try to find a seat?

04:19.971 --> 04:21.632
If you can't find a seat...

04:21.807 --> 04:23.297
...stand against the wall.

04:23.575 --> 04:26.567
Let's put our desks in a circle
and discuss our feelings.

04:27.379 --> 04:28.869
One body to a desk.

04:33.852 --> 04:35.410
Could we talk about sex?

04:37.389 --> 04:39.584
Then I'd have to give sex for homework.

04:42.394 --> 04:44.658
Stand back everybody, please.

04:44.896 --> 04:47.729
I can get you fired for saying that.

04:48.233 --> 04:49.598
What'd he say?

04:50.502 --> 04:51.833
¿Entienden inglés?

04:52.337 --> 04:53.497
Sometimes.

05:00.512 --> 05:03.379
Please move forward
if you do not speak English.

05:05.684 --> 05:08.517
All the first row, stand up. Move out.

05:08.753 --> 05:10.311
I was the first one here.

05:10.522 --> 05:12.615
I'll find you another seat, okay?

05:17.629 --> 05:19.028
Be careful.

05:19.431 --> 05:21.092
This is Math 1-A.

05:21.366 --> 05:25.359
I don't need math. I got a solar calculator
with my dozen doughnuts.

05:25.637 --> 05:28.265
The bus is exact change. No big deal.

05:29.407 --> 05:30.567
Quiet!

06:09.080 --> 06:11.674
Everyone back in the classroom!

06:13.818 --> 06:15.979
Everyone back in the class!

06:17.689 --> 06:21.181
It was a premature bell. Back in the class.

06:21.693 --> 06:23.251
That was a premature bell.

06:23.495 --> 06:26.430
Premature bell?
We're not supposed to discuss sex in class.

06:26.765 --> 06:29.427
Sit down! Stop talking!

06:39.644 --> 06:41.202
They rigged the bell.

06:41.713 --> 06:43.340
Those little bastards.

07:24.289 --> 07:25.779
She's looking good, Joe.

07:26.057 --> 07:28.048
When are you coming aboard?

07:28.593 --> 07:30.458
I get seasick in the rain.

07:31.629 --> 07:34.928
- Have you seen my boy?
- He was riding around here somewhere.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.992
I hear your company's pushing
whole hog into PCs.

07:38.269 --> 07:39.998
I don't work there anymore.

07:40.105 --> 07:43.597
Jaime's teaching high school now.
Here's your thingy.

07:44.409 --> 07:46.775
If you got laid off,
why didn't you come to me?

07:46.845 --> 07:49.336
We pay kids right out of college $30,000.

07:49.681 --> 07:52.912
I didn't get laid off. I want to teach.

07:53.752 --> 07:55.242
High school teacher.

07:55.854 --> 07:57.754
Well, good. That's great.

07:59.958 --> 08:01.619
This is your job.

08:01.926 --> 08:04.588
I was going to do it.
Why do you think I hurried home?

08:06.865 --> 08:10.164
You're not even breathing hard,
you're hurrying so fast.

08:10.435 --> 08:11.925
Have a good night, Joe.

08:16.107 --> 08:20.066
I want a burger, hold the French fries,
the onions, and the pickles!

08:20.612 --> 08:22.443
You look like Julia Child.

08:31.823 --> 08:32.789
What you got?

08:33.591 --> 08:34.649
It's an apple.

08:37.662 --> 08:38.788
How much?

08:40.732 --> 08:41.926
What do you mean?

08:44.402 --> 08:45.835
What have you got?

08:46.638 --> 08:47.627
Half.

08:48.039 --> 08:49.028
Good.

08:49.340 --> 08:51.570
Excuse my German accent.

08:54.712 --> 08:55.872
What have you got?

08:56.514 --> 08:58.448
Missing 25 percent.

09:07.725 --> 09:10.193
- What?
- It's missing 25 percent.

09:16.167 --> 09:18.761
That's right. Missing 25 percent.

09:19.404 --> 09:21.929
Is it true intelligent people
make better lovers?

09:26.311 --> 09:27.642
What you got?

09:29.447 --> 09:30.778
I got a core.

09:31.716 --> 09:33.240
You owe me 100 percent.

09:35.019 --> 09:36.850
I'll see you in The People's Court.

09:39.824 --> 09:43.590
Everyone please open your books,
Chapter 2, Page 26.

09:44.229 --> 09:46.288
Multiplication of fractions...

09:47.799 --> 09:49.130
...and percentages.

09:51.102 --> 09:52.330
25 percent...

09:52.871 --> 09:53.963
...50 percent...

09:54.305 --> 09:55.602
...75 percent...

09:59.144 --> 10:00.372
...and 100 percent.

10:01.880 --> 10:04.075
Who's calling the shots, ese?

10:06.384 --> 10:07.874
Have you got a slip?

10:10.722 --> 10:12.087
You got a slip?

10:24.836 --> 10:28.431
You'll have to stand in the back
until I can get another desk.

10:28.640 --> 10:30.267
You sit right here.

10:32.777 --> 10:37.146
Everyone please read
the first paragraph for a second.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.182
- Where's your equipment?
- Don't got any.

10:46.958 --> 10:49.256
Got to come to this class prepared.

10:51.095 --> 10:52.926
Do the work in my head.

10:58.002 --> 10:59.663
You know the times tables?

11:00.538 --> 11:01.903
I know the one's...

11:03.107 --> 11:04.301
...two's...

11:04.909 --> 11:06.103
...three's.

11:07.345 --> 11:09.939
Finger Man. I heard about you.

11:12.217 --> 11:13.548
Are you the Finger Man?

11:13.618 --> 11:15.449
I'm the Finger Man, too.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.483
Do you know what I can do?

11:18.456 --> 11:20.253
I know how to multiply by nine.

11:20.725 --> 11:23.250
9 x 3. One, two, three. What do you get?

11:24.462 --> 11:25.759
27!

11:26.931 --> 11:29.866
6 x 9. One, two, three, four, five, six.

11:30.401 --> 11:32.892
What do you get? 54!

11:35.640 --> 11:38.268
Do you want a hard one?
How about 8 x 9?

11:41.212 --> 11:43.146
What have you got? 72.

11:45.316 --> 11:46.510
Wait a minute.

11:46.884 --> 11:51.150
Please make sure you do problems
1 through 20. Page 26.

11:51.322 --> 11:53.517
Can I have my book, Mr. Escalante?

11:53.992 --> 11:55.892
Don't bring it to class again.

12:01.299 --> 12:02.766
Don't get excited.

12:04.102 --> 12:06.935
Cut me a D like the other profes.

12:08.439 --> 12:09.997
I'll read my funny books...

12:10.275 --> 12:12.607
...count the holes in the ceiling...

12:12.944 --> 12:14.434
...kick back.

12:15.179 --> 12:17.340
First thing, I can teach you some manners.

12:23.621 --> 12:25.612
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

12:25.957 --> 12:28.050
Lose a finger, I can't count to ten.

12:33.464 --> 12:35.557
We've seen vatos like you before.

12:36.167 --> 12:37.794
You'll be hurting soon.

12:39.771 --> 12:41.136
Ponte trucha.

12:49.147 --> 12:53.447
I was so worried the kids would know
more than me, I'd wake at 5:00 a. M...

12:53.584 --> 12:55.882
...down my coffee and hit the math text.

12:56.154 --> 12:58.213
I finally get every chapter down...

12:58.489 --> 13:00.480
...and now they change the book on me.

13:00.725 --> 13:04.388
Math, you either love or hate.
You got problems, come see me.

13:04.729 --> 13:06.890
Thanks, Jaime. See you later.

13:16.507 --> 13:19.670
You're in love? Which one? Let me know.

13:20.011 --> 13:21.501
No, that's all right.

13:21.679 --> 13:25.672
- Come on, Johnny, don't be afraid.
- I'm not "Johnny."

13:26.250 --> 13:28.741
I know, Tito. Tito Grande.

13:49.540 --> 13:50.768
Angel!

14:10.828 --> 14:11.988
Go get a teacher!

14:13.064 --> 14:14.827
It's Frank Garcia.

14:15.466 --> 14:17.832
When I say García, you answer, okay?

14:19.871 --> 14:21.168
Are your friends auditing?

14:21.239 --> 14:23.469
I audited them to come with me.

14:31.649 --> 14:34.311
I'm El Ciclón from Bolivia.

14:35.019 --> 14:36.384
One-man gang.

14:37.488 --> 14:39.683
This is my domain.

14:41.492 --> 14:42.789
Don't give me no gas.

14:43.361 --> 14:46.853
I'll jump on your face,
tattoo your chromosomes.

14:47.165 --> 14:50.794
This is basic math,
but basic math is too easy for you.

14:51.269 --> 14:53.863
So I'll teach you algebra,
because I'm the champ.

14:54.372 --> 14:56.863
If the only thing you can do is
add and subtract...

14:56.941 --> 14:59.637
...you'll be able to do one thing: Pump gas.

14:59.710 --> 15:03.146
Ripping off a gas station is better
than working in one.

15:06.951 --> 15:08.441
I'm a tough guy.

15:08.719 --> 15:12.382
Tough guys don't do math,
tough guys deep fry chicken for a living.

15:12.824 --> 15:14.815
You want a wing or a leg?

15:17.328 --> 15:19.819
Who ever heard of negative
and positive numbers?

15:20.631 --> 15:22.724
Negative numbers are like unemployment.

15:23.301 --> 15:26.202
Ten million people out of work,
that's a negative number.

15:26.304 --> 15:29.535
We'll need lots of Kleenex 'cause
there's gonna be bloodshed.

15:29.807 --> 15:31.798
Have you ever been to the beach?

15:34.245 --> 15:36.475
Have you ever played with the sand?

15:38.049 --> 15:38.981
Finger Man!

15:42.487 --> 15:44.011
You ever dig a hole?

15:45.389 --> 15:48.085
The sand that comes out of the hole,
that's a positive.

15:48.159 --> 15:49.990
The hole is a negative.

15:52.763 --> 15:55.493
That's it. Simple. Anybody can do it.

15:55.833 --> 15:58.961
- 2 + 2 =...

16:00.171 --> 16:01.069
Net Head?

16:04.475 --> 16:05.567
Answer it.

16:06.777 --> 16:08.711
Come on, you know the answer.

16:10.081 --> 16:12.447
- 2 + 2. Fill the hole.

16:14.018 --> 16:16.680
If I had that on my hand,
I wouldn't raise it, either.

16:18.623 --> 16:20.989
- 2 + 2 =...

16:21.259 --> 16:23.693
Anybody can do it. Fill the hole.

16:23.794 --> 16:25.591
- 2 + 2 =...

16:27.765 --> 16:29.756
Just fill the hole.

16:30.034 --> 16:31.695
You can do it.

16:32.136 --> 16:34.570
Don't let these burros laugh at you.

16:35.306 --> 16:37.274
- 2 + 2 =...

16:38.576 --> 16:40.567
I'll break your neck like a toothpick.

16:45.349 --> 16:46.475
0.

16:48.052 --> 16:49.212
0? You're right.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.947
Simple. That's it.

16:51.322 --> 16:54.450
- 2 + 2 = 0. He just filled the hole.

16:55.226 --> 16:59.890
Neither the Greeks nor the Romans were
capable of using the concept of zero.

17:00.431 --> 17:01.830
It was your ancestors...

17:01.899 --> 17:06.393
...the Mayas, who first contemplated
the zero. The absence of value.

17:06.771 --> 17:07.931
True story.

17:08.172 --> 17:10.402
You burros have math in your blood.

17:10.775 --> 17:14.006
Kimo sabe todo.
The man knows everything!

17:17.147 --> 17:21.743
Parenthesis means multiply.
Every time you see this, multiply.

17:21.852 --> 17:25.252
A negative times a negative
equals a positive.

17:25.623 --> 17:28.421
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive." Say it.

17:28.492 --> 17:31.484
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive." Say it!

17:31.562 --> 17:34.395
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive."

17:34.665 --> 17:35.495
Again!

17:35.566 --> 17:38.057
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive."

17:38.202 --> 17:41.194
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive."

17:41.772 --> 17:42.830
I can't hear you.

17:42.907 --> 17:45.501
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive."

17:45.576 --> 17:46.270
Louder!

17:46.344 --> 17:48.972
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive!"

17:49.213 --> 17:50.202
Louder!

17:50.281 --> 17:53.045
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive!"

17:53.618 --> 17:55.017
Why?

17:57.655 --> 18:00.749
My point is I don't want
to be the principal...

18:00.992 --> 18:05.326
...of the first school in the history
of Los Angeles to lose its accreditation.

18:05.696 --> 18:09.530
I'm the last person to say that
this math department couldn't improve.

18:09.700 --> 18:12.134
But if you want higher test scores...

18:12.203 --> 18:15.400
...start by changing the economic level
of this community.

18:15.806 --> 18:20.470
The purpose of this meeting is to review
the recommendations for accreditation.

18:21.379 --> 18:22.710
Any suggestions?

18:25.349 --> 18:28.182
I don't think
I should be teaching math next semester.

18:28.586 --> 18:31.214
I was hired to be phys. Ed. Instructor.

18:31.656 --> 18:33.317
As I said before...

18:33.891 --> 18:38.590
...we lack the resources to implement
the changes the district demands.

18:39.897 --> 18:43.731
Mr. Sanzaki,
you must have at least one comment.

18:44.402 --> 18:47.235
This may not be the right time
to say this, but...

18:48.105 --> 18:50.903
...I'm sorry, but I won't be coming back
after Christmas.

18:51.008 --> 18:53.101
I got a job with aerospace.

18:55.513 --> 18:56.673
How much money?

18:57.114 --> 19:01.414
We have the remainder of the year
before we're put on probation.

19:02.019 --> 19:05.511
- If we fail, we lose accreditation.
- If we fail?

19:05.856 --> 19:08.848
You can't teach logarithms to illiterates.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.893
These kids come to us
with barely a 7th grade education.

19:13.197 --> 19:17.031
There isn't a teacher in this room
who isn't doing everything he possibly can.

19:17.535 --> 19:19.628
I'm not. I could teach more.

19:21.772 --> 19:24.935
I'm sure Mr. Escalante
has good intentions...

19:25.276 --> 19:27.938
...but he's only been here a few months.

19:29.647 --> 19:33.640
Students will rise to the level
of expectations, Señor Molina.

19:36.654 --> 19:38.554
What do you need, Mr. Escalante?

19:39.457 --> 19:41.948
Ganas. All we need is ganas.

19:42.059 --> 19:43.048
What's ganas?

19:47.031 --> 19:50.023
We will begin each class with a quiz.

19:53.370 --> 19:57.204
There will be no free rides, no excuses.

19:57.541 --> 20:00.374
You already have two strikes against you.

20:00.711 --> 20:03.043
There are some people in this world...

20:03.380 --> 20:06.543
...who assume that you know less
than you do...

20:06.884 --> 20:10.718
...because of your name
and your complexion...

20:11.055 --> 20:14.047
...but math is the great equalizer.

20:15.726 --> 20:18.388
When you go for a job, the employer...

20:18.729 --> 20:21.630
...will not want to hear your problems.
Neither do I.

20:21.899 --> 20:24.891
You'll work harder
than you ever worked before.

20:25.736 --> 20:28.728
And the only thing I ask
from you is ganas...

20:29.073 --> 20:31.405
...desire... a haircut.

20:32.143 --> 20:35.738
If you don't have the ganas,
I will give it to you because I am an expert.

20:35.813 --> 20:38.077
Today is Monday,
tomorrow is Wednesday...

20:38.249 --> 20:41.013
...Friday is payday, the weekly test.

20:41.118 --> 20:42.676
There will be no diagonal vision.

20:42.753 --> 20:45.813
Keep your eyes on your own paper.
You have 10 minutes to finish.

20:45.890 --> 20:50.623
If you finish early, start the assignment
on the board. No questions? Good.

20:53.697 --> 20:56.188
¡Angel, vámonos!

21:06.844 --> 21:08.835
I was said to go here.

21:14.919 --> 21:16.443
Nice knowing you.

21:17.521 --> 21:19.682
Have a good day. Arrivederci!

21:20.124 --> 21:22.957
You're in luck. Take the seat.

21:23.661 --> 21:27.153
Relax, take Sominex.
Don't sleep in my class.

21:28.432 --> 21:30.366
I take that as an insult.

21:54.325 --> 21:57.988
Kimo, I want to talk to you about the class.

21:58.562 --> 22:00.587
You ain't got a seat. Don't give me no gas.

22:00.664 --> 22:02.962
I know about that. It was a mistake.

22:03.100 --> 22:05.432
I'm gonna fly straight, but I got a problem.

22:05.502 --> 22:06.662
Yeah, me.

22:07.004 --> 22:08.494
Seriously. Books.

22:08.572 --> 22:10.836
The homies can't see me
haul them around.

22:11.175 --> 22:13.769
You don't want anyone to think
you're intelligent.

22:13.844 --> 22:17.177
Maybe I can have two books,
keep one stashed at home.

22:18.849 --> 22:22.683
I'll cut you a deal.
I'll give you three books.

22:23.020 --> 22:25.511
Take one home. One for your class.

22:25.756 --> 22:27.348
This one is broken.

22:32.863 --> 22:36.458
One for your locker,
so nobody sees you carrying it around.

22:36.533 --> 22:37.795
Easily understood?

22:37.868 --> 22:39.130
What do I get?

22:40.204 --> 22:41.865
Protection, Kimo.

22:42.206 --> 22:44.367
Protección, understand?

22:46.110 --> 22:47.441
I understand.

22:49.213 --> 22:50.874
I understand.

22:53.384 --> 22:56.547
That's the only reason
I'm still in Kimo's class.

22:56.654 --> 22:59.418
Don't tell her that you dig her.

22:59.490 --> 23:02.220
That's the worst thing you can do
with a woman.

23:09.066 --> 23:12.229
I'm fed up with this pelón we got
for a teacher.

23:12.903 --> 23:15.064
Escalante has a bug up his ass.

23:15.306 --> 23:19.470
He's from South America.
He's probably a Nazi come out of hiding.

23:19.576 --> 23:23.068
Don't you know?
Garfield can't get accredited.

23:23.480 --> 23:26.643
Only teachers who act like assholes
will keep their jobs.

23:26.917 --> 23:29.750
What if we all decide not to take this test?

23:30.254 --> 23:32.085
He can't fail the whole class.

23:32.423 --> 23:34.254
Mutiny. That's cool.

23:40.264 --> 23:41.925
See you guys later.

23:49.273 --> 23:52.606
Camejo thinks she's hot
because she dates gabachos.

23:56.613 --> 23:59.275
If we don't do better today, heads will roll.

23:59.350 --> 24:02.683
I've never gotten lower
than a B+ in my life.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.953
Because you take those
Mickey Mouse classes.

24:06.590 --> 24:10.253
Always get an A.
Here you have a chance for a solid D.

24:14.965 --> 24:16.626
You got 10 minutes.

24:20.471 --> 24:21.961
Here he comes.

24:23.374 --> 24:24.966
Watch this.

24:28.145 --> 24:29.203
What's wrong with you?

24:29.813 --> 24:31.474
I'm not taking the quiz.

24:32.649 --> 24:34.708
You didn't turn in your homework.

24:35.152 --> 24:36.483
My goat ate it.

24:41.658 --> 24:45.150
You don't do your homework,
you don't get a ticket to watch the show.

24:46.997 --> 24:48.396
Give her the chair!

24:50.801 --> 24:51.790
Shit.

24:59.343 --> 25:01.174
Chair! Chair! Chair!

25:10.854 --> 25:12.082
Shut up!

25:16.026 --> 25:19.018
Get back to your tests.
You've got less than nine minutes.

25:24.101 --> 25:25.762
Now you're the show.

25:27.704 --> 25:31.868
What's the matter with you?
Are you the dumb student? Come on!

25:46.890 --> 25:48.221
3:00.

25:48.792 --> 25:50.783
You'll have to do it anyway.

27:49.012 --> 27:50.343
Kids go to bed?

27:52.916 --> 27:54.406
Papa go to work?

27:56.520 --> 27:58.351
Can I fix you something to eat?

28:03.360 --> 28:06.352
Mija, could you please turn off that light?

28:37.060 --> 28:38.721
Orale, homeboy.

28:39.563 --> 28:40.894
Teacher time, ese.

28:47.070 --> 28:49.061
Tell Kimo I say, "¿Qué hubo?", ese.

28:49.406 --> 28:51.067
Oh, shit man!

28:59.082 --> 29:01.414
Green light, red light?

29:01.752 --> 29:03.083
Anybody?

29:05.422 --> 29:08.084
Late! Late, Angel!

29:12.829 --> 29:14.820
- Go see the counselor.
- Come on, Kimo.

29:15.265 --> 29:19.429
Go to wood shop, make a shoeshine box.
You'll need it.

29:21.938 --> 29:23.929
You're the man, you know.

29:26.109 --> 29:30.944
Why don't you put them in college, huh?
So dumb taco benders like me...

29:31.615 --> 29:33.606
...can pick their vegetables...

29:34.117 --> 29:35.948
...collect their garbage...

29:36.453 --> 29:38.614
...clip their poodle's toenails.

29:48.131 --> 29:49.792
I may be a sinner...

29:50.867 --> 29:53.199
...but I'm willing to pay for my sins.

29:55.806 --> 29:59.139
One-shot deal. Go sit down.
See you at 3:00.

30:02.813 --> 30:04.144
Go to hell.

30:07.818 --> 30:09.979
I got more bad news for you.

30:10.320 --> 30:13.483
What I'm going to say will trip you out.

30:15.325 --> 30:17.657
Mr. Escalante, I forgot my pencil.

30:19.496 --> 30:21.157
He can have mine.

30:22.833 --> 30:24.664
Today is my last day.

30:36.847 --> 30:38.678
Did you enjoy your taquitos?

30:43.520 --> 30:45.511
Except for one thing.

30:46.423 --> 30:48.186
Someone doesn't know how to add.

30:50.193 --> 30:51.854
She should be back in school.

31:02.372 --> 31:05.864
Papa, this is Mr. Escalante,
my math teacher.

31:15.118 --> 31:16.779
Can you sit with us?

31:18.321 --> 31:20.983
Anita, bring us a couple of beers.

31:25.729 --> 31:28.061
You should get another waitress.

31:30.734 --> 31:35.068
Ana can be the first in your family
to graduate and go to college.

31:36.006 --> 31:37.997
I thank you for your concern.

31:38.909 --> 31:41.571
Her mother, sisters,
and brothers work here.

31:42.078 --> 31:45.570
This is a family business. She is needed.

31:46.917 --> 31:49.909
She could help the family more
by getting an education.

31:51.421 --> 31:55.414
She'd probably get pregnant.
She wouldn't finish college.

31:56.426 --> 31:59.259
Anita, go help your mom in the kitchen.

32:01.932 --> 32:04.423
She talks about going to medical school.

32:06.503 --> 32:07.663
I don't think so.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.904
She should make her own choices.

32:18.114 --> 32:19.775
She'll just get fat.

32:20.116 --> 32:23.608
She'll waste her life here. She's a top kid!

32:24.788 --> 32:28.280
I started washing dishes
for a nickel an hour.

32:28.625 --> 32:30.616
Now I own this place.

32:32.028 --> 32:33.518
Did I waste my life?

32:33.864 --> 32:36.856
I washed dishes too
when I came to America.

32:37.033 --> 32:38.022
Good!

32:38.468 --> 32:41.130
Put on an apron and give us a hand.

32:42.172 --> 32:45.107
Your husband comes
to my restaurant, eats...

32:45.542 --> 32:47.134
...then insults me.

32:47.310 --> 32:49.540
Excuse my husband, Mr. Delgado.

32:50.814 --> 32:53.044
He just wants what's best for Ana.

32:55.886 --> 32:59.481
She could go to college,
then teach you how to run the place.

33:00.156 --> 33:01.316
Professor?

33:02.959 --> 33:06.122
I don't want your money
and I don't need your business.

33:08.498 --> 33:10.329
Skip it. Tip.

33:13.670 --> 33:17.037
He puts hot chili in his dip
to sell extra beer.

33:33.023 --> 33:34.422
Dog, dog, dog, dog!

33:38.361 --> 33:40.693
Everybody look at the board.

33:41.197 --> 33:45.691
Will someone please read for me
what's on the board? Anybody.

33:46.036 --> 33:49.699
Juan has five times as many girlfriends
as Pedro.

33:50.140 --> 33:53.109
Carlos has one girlfriend less than Pedro.

33:53.543 --> 33:56.876
If their total number of girlfriends is 20...

33:56.947 --> 33:59.609
...how many does each gigolo have?

34:01.051 --> 34:03.042
Late! Late!

34:03.186 --> 34:05.347
Late! Late!

34:11.393 --> 34:14.556
How many girlfriends does
each gigolo have? Anybody.

34:15.231 --> 34:17.893
You think you got it, Einstein?

34:18.134 --> 34:22.628
Juan is x. Carlos is y. Pedro is x + y.

34:23.072 --> 34:25.234
Is Pedro bisexual, or what?

34:25.909 --> 34:29.242
I have a terrible feeling about you.

34:32.014 --> 34:34.313
5x = Juan's girlfriends.

34:34.985 --> 34:36.246
You're good now...

34:36.319 --> 34:40.483
...but you'll end up barefoot,
pregnant and in the kitchen.

34:41.324 --> 34:43.315
Can you get negative girlfriends?

34:43.560 --> 34:45.221
No, just negative boyfriends.

34:45.428 --> 34:48.920
Please forgive them,
for they know not what they do!

34:49.933 --> 34:52.766
Carlos has x - 5 girlfriends, ¿qué no?

34:53.103 --> 34:54.934
"Que no" is right. Que no.

34:55.972 --> 34:57.963
The answer to my prayers!

34:58.174 --> 34:59.607
May I go to the restroom?

35:00.944 --> 35:03.276
In 10 minutes. Hold it.

35:06.282 --> 35:07.442
Hit it.

35:07.784 --> 35:09.775
It's a trick problem, Mr. Kimo.

35:10.120 --> 35:13.419
You need to know how many girlfriends
they have in common.

35:15.125 --> 35:17.116
It's not that they're stupid.

35:17.927 --> 35:19.519
They just don't know anything.

35:19.729 --> 35:20.718
I'm wrong?

35:21.297 --> 35:23.788
X = Pedro's girlfriends.

35:24.134 --> 35:26.466
5x = Juan's girlfriends.

35:26.803 --> 35:29.772
X - 1 = Carlos's girlfriends.

35:29.839 --> 35:33.570
(x + 5x) + (x -1) = 20.

35:33.877 --> 35:35.344
So, x = 3.

35:42.485 --> 35:44.146
Good to see you.

35:44.754 --> 35:47.917
This makes no sense unless we see
how it works in the real world.

35:48.491 --> 35:53.155
Could I get a couple of gigolos
for a practical demonstration?

35:53.396 --> 35:55.728
No, no. Just kidding.

36:34.370 --> 36:36.201
What kind of math is this?

36:36.706 --> 36:39.368
The one that's up right now is calculus.

36:39.709 --> 36:41.540
You'll get it in college.

36:41.878 --> 36:44.711
My daughter uses this program
in her high school.

36:58.461 --> 37:00.691
I want to teach calculus next year.

37:04.234 --> 37:06.225
Boy, that's a jump.

37:09.906 --> 37:14.240
That's ridiculous.
They haven't had trig or math analysis.

37:14.811 --> 37:16.472
They can take them this summer.

37:16.746 --> 37:18.907
Our best students in summer school?

37:19.149 --> 37:20.810
From 7:00 to 12:00.

37:21.251 --> 37:24.584
Every day, including Saturdays.
That would do it.

37:28.258 --> 37:31.921
Summer classrooms are reserved
for remedial courses.

37:32.929 --> 37:35.830
To turn this school around,
start from the top.

37:36.933 --> 37:39.424
Mr. Escalante, don't lecture us.

37:39.836 --> 37:43.499
Our kids can't handle calculus.
We don't even have the books.

37:44.007 --> 37:48.000
If they pass the Advanced Placement Test,
they get college credit.

37:48.444 --> 37:50.435
There are some teachers here...

37:50.780 --> 37:53.943
...who couldn't pass
the Advanced Placement Test.

37:54.851 --> 37:57.115
You think you can make this fly?

38:04.627 --> 38:06.618
I teach calculus or...

38:06.963 --> 38:08.521
...have a good day.

38:10.300 --> 38:13.463
If this man can walk in here...

38:14.070 --> 38:17.870
...and dictate his own terms,
over my objections...

38:19.209 --> 38:22.269
...I see no reason to continue
as department chair.

38:24.547 --> 38:26.708
Don't take this personally.

38:28.484 --> 38:30.816
I'm thinking about those kids.

38:33.156 --> 38:35.989
If they try and don't succeed...

38:37.327 --> 38:40.490
...you'll shatter what little
self-confidence they have.

38:43.833 --> 38:47.166
These aren't the types that bounce back.

38:49.839 --> 38:51.500
Have a good day.

39:19.602 --> 39:22.264
Kimo, it stinks like last year in here.

39:25.375 --> 39:27.366
Somebody give Claudia an orange.

39:28.878 --> 39:31.210
Okay, okay! Sit down!

39:34.717 --> 39:38.915
You think I want to do this?
The Japanese pay me.

39:39.522 --> 39:44.084
They're tired of making everything.
They want you to pull your own weight...

39:44.727 --> 39:47.560
...so they can go take vacations
on Mount Fuji.

39:49.232 --> 39:53.225
Kimo, I thought this room
was supposed to be air-conditioned.

39:54.237 --> 39:56.569
You should think cool.

39:58.574 --> 39:59.734
Think...

39:59.976 --> 40:01.307
Cool.

40:01.911 --> 40:02.969
Think...

40:03.413 --> 40:04.744
Cool.

40:08.318 --> 40:09.649
Cool!

40:23.433 --> 40:27.597
I get this letter saying
I'm fired because of Proposition 13.

40:27.837 --> 40:29.828
I'm down to $936.

40:30.273 --> 40:33.106
I invest $100 in resumes and buy this suit.

40:33.509 --> 40:36.000
I hit every insurance company in the city.

40:36.446 --> 40:39.210
My wife wants us to move
into her parents' rec room.

40:39.282 --> 40:43.616
Two weeks later I get another letter
telling me to go back to work.

40:43.853 --> 40:45.343
How do you like the suit?

40:45.521 --> 40:47.853
- Fabulous.
- How about the color?

40:50.059 --> 40:51.822
Welcome back, pelón!

41:36.406 --> 41:38.738
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

41:39.175 --> 41:40.164
Sure?

41:40.410 --> 41:42.571
Yes! I said I was fine.

41:50.920 --> 41:54.083
We will go step by step, inch by inch.

41:54.490 --> 41:57.823
Calculus was not made to be easy.
It already is.

41:57.927 --> 42:00.418
Remember the good times we had
last summer?

42:01.030 --> 42:04.693
Remember when things were
really jumping good?

42:05.935 --> 42:09.769
That's Gone With tAhe Wind.
Now it's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

42:10.039 --> 42:14.442
Come on, a contract?
You mean you can't trust us by now?

42:16.045 --> 42:20.709
Those of you who commit will be preparing
for the AdVanced Placement Test.

42:21.050 --> 42:23.541
Have this signed before class tomorrow.

42:23.786 --> 42:28.450
We come in an hour early, take your class
two periods and stay until 5:00?

42:28.691 --> 42:29.885
Believe it or don't.

42:29.959 --> 42:33.451
We have to come on Saturdays?
And no vacations?

42:33.796 --> 42:36.287
Pass the A.P. And you get college credit.

42:36.566 --> 42:40.559
- Big deal.
- We're seniors. We get to slack off.

42:41.471 --> 42:46.306
Can you make it Saturday morning
after playing in your band Friday nights?

42:47.443 --> 42:50.071
I know you love scaring us into doing stuff.

42:50.746 --> 42:53.078
But that gets old real fast.

42:57.520 --> 42:58.851
Hey, Kimo.

42:58.921 --> 43:01.412
You proud of me? I'm the first dude here!

43:02.492 --> 43:04.153
What's calculus?

43:11.434 --> 43:15.336
Calculus is math
that Sir Isaac Newton invented...

43:15.438 --> 43:20.273
...to figure out planet orbits.
But he never told anybody about it...

43:20.343 --> 43:24.507
...until this other scientist
claimed he had invented calculus.

43:24.780 --> 43:27.146
But the guy was so stupid
he got it all wrong...

43:27.216 --> 43:31.380
...so Newton went public
to fix his mistakes. Isn't that neat?

43:31.854 --> 43:34.186
For a genius, Newton was an idiot.

43:34.457 --> 43:37.620
If I invent something,
I'll make sure to get paid.

43:38.027 --> 43:41.519
I hope this isn't an excuse
to stay out all hours.

43:42.031 --> 43:44.295
Trust me, Mom. Sign it.

43:44.634 --> 43:46.864
Boys don't like it if you're smart.

43:47.203 --> 43:51.867
I'm doing this so I don't have to depend
on some dumb guy for the rest of my life.

44:02.485 --> 44:03.645
Thank you.

44:06.155 --> 44:09.716
You don't have it signed,
you don't have a ticket to watch the show.

44:09.859 --> 44:11.690
Thank you, Mr. Kung Fu.

44:13.663 --> 44:15.654
Mr. Blue Eyes, thank you.

44:15.898 --> 44:17.889
Elizabeth, my Taylor!

44:18.334 --> 44:19.995
Sophia, my Loren.

44:20.336 --> 44:22.998
Get a haircut.
How many times I got to tell you?

44:24.173 --> 44:26.164
Red, get a new jacket.

44:29.011 --> 44:30.842
Clint, forget your gun?

44:31.180 --> 44:32.670
Unfold it.

44:38.187 --> 44:39.518
Hey, you didn't...

44:39.855 --> 44:41.413
Get out of the way.

44:42.191 --> 44:44.625
- You didn't sign it.
- I'm putting school on hold.

44:44.694 --> 44:46.355
Go back until you sign it.

44:47.196 --> 44:50.859
My uncle offered me a job
operating a forklift weekends.

44:51.100 --> 44:52.192
So what?

44:52.768 --> 44:55.601
Two years in the union
and I'll make more than you.

44:57.039 --> 45:00.873
The money I'll be making
will buy me a new Trans Am.

45:01.277 --> 45:05.441
Wouldn't you rather be designing
these than repairing them?

45:05.715 --> 45:08.377
You can't even do that.
They got fuel injection.

45:08.718 --> 45:11.710
- You're going to strip my gears.
- What's the problem?

45:14.890 --> 45:16.551
Don't panic, Johnny.

45:16.692 --> 45:19.183
Just watch out for the other guy.

45:21.631 --> 45:23.223
- Right or left?
- Where are we going?

45:23.299 --> 45:25.563
- Right or left!
- Go right!

45:36.579 --> 45:39.980
All you see is the turn.
You don't see the road ahead.

45:47.590 --> 45:50.423
Open the gate. We're going to be late.

45:51.427 --> 45:53.088
Why are you here so early?

45:53.162 --> 45:55.653
We're going to Mr. Escalante's class.

46:00.536 --> 46:02.868
Wake up. Drink some coffee.

46:08.277 --> 46:10.939
One, you got the graph right here.

46:11.147 --> 46:14.310
Two, this is the most important part.
Right here.

46:14.784 --> 46:16.775
The radius of rotation.

46:17.119 --> 46:20.282
That's it. Anybody got any questions?

46:22.291 --> 46:25.783
Anybody can do it
if you remember one basic element:

46:26.128 --> 46:27.686
The element of surprise.

46:27.763 --> 46:29.754
Stay awake! Wake up!

46:30.132 --> 46:33.295
Wake up! Bring toothpicks
to pinch open your eyes.

46:33.703 --> 46:35.364
Do you understand, Johnny?

46:35.538 --> 46:38.473
I was swimming with dolphins,
whispering imaginary numbers...

46:38.541 --> 46:41.135
...looking for the fourth dimension.

46:41.811 --> 46:44.302
Go back to sleep. That's very good.

46:44.513 --> 46:46.174
Any questions?

46:46.582 --> 46:48.914
Yes? No? Nothing? Okay.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.332
You should have it by now.

47:08.838 --> 47:10.999
What's the answer? Anybody?

47:13.609 --> 47:15.338
We're going backwards.

47:15.411 --> 47:17.845
You're fooling around too much
on the weekend.

47:17.947 --> 47:20.609
This girl's got to do some work
from the neck up.

47:21.517 --> 47:23.508
We'll have to stay late again.

47:26.122 --> 47:28.613
We can have pizza delivered.

47:29.191 --> 47:32.683
We can get fried chicken, cheeseburgers.

47:33.429 --> 47:37.763
Donations? You owe me money.
You don't deserve the grades you get.

47:42.037 --> 47:44.528
Are you late for another date?

47:44.874 --> 47:47.434
She has more boyfriends
than Elizabeth Taylor!

47:50.045 --> 47:53.913
I don't appreciate you using
my personal life to entertain this class.

48:22.912 --> 48:25.073
Everything is falling apart.

48:25.181 --> 48:27.342
My boyfriend is freaking out!

48:27.616 --> 48:30.949
School sucks.
I'm in that classroom all day, Kimo.

48:31.754 --> 48:36.248
Look at my clothes and my hair.
I can't even comb it. I hate my life.

48:39.428 --> 48:41.259
So what's the problem?

49:28.177 --> 49:32.841
You're going to have to bring him in.
I'm not a doctor, Ma'am.

49:33.349 --> 49:36.682
There's no way. I don't do diagnosis.

49:44.393 --> 49:47.055
Are we going to see the doctor
before next week?

49:47.396 --> 49:49.125
Hold on. ¿Seguro?

49:51.066 --> 49:52.158
Medi-Cal?

49:52.735 --> 49:54.532
How are you going to pay for this?

49:54.603 --> 49:57.538
If we could pay for it,
we'd go to a regular hospital.

49:57.740 --> 50:00.072
My grandmother will
get pneumonia waiting.

50:00.342 --> 50:02.674
Take a seat and we'll call your number.

50:02.778 --> 50:06.942
You have to bring him in.
There's no way around it.

50:08.350 --> 50:11.513
I understand that,
but you have to bring him in.

50:20.029 --> 50:21.690
Try the shortcut.

50:21.931 --> 50:24.923
This is easy. Baby stuff for Boy Scouts.

50:25.200 --> 50:26.861
My mind don't work this way.

50:27.202 --> 50:32.037
Tic-tac-toe. It's a piece of cake,
upside down. Watch for the green light.

50:38.047 --> 50:40.538
I've been with you guys for two years!

50:40.683 --> 50:44.676
Everyone knows I'm the dumbest!
I can't handle calculus!

50:45.888 --> 50:49.119
They have a better chance
on the A.P. Test without me.

50:51.293 --> 50:52.282
Don't laugh!

50:54.897 --> 50:57.127
Laugh! You're breaking our hearts.

50:57.466 --> 50:58.797
Don't do this.

50:58.867 --> 51:03.270
He'll sacrifice himself to benefit the team.
Do you have the ganas!

51:04.073 --> 51:05.233
I have the ganas.

51:05.407 --> 51:07.034
- You want me to do it for you?
- Yes!

51:07.109 --> 51:09.043
You're supposed to say no!

51:09.912 --> 51:11.846
I'm going to have to get tough.

51:11.981 --> 51:14.541
We'll have to work
right through Christmas break.

51:23.258 --> 51:26.091
The counselor was just here
looking for you.

51:27.096 --> 51:30.088
Something about cosmetology classes.

51:30.766 --> 51:33.428
He says, there's three different levels.

51:33.769 --> 51:38.263
One for boys, one for girls and one
for I don't know what. Go find out.

51:38.507 --> 51:40.338
Kimo, listen. It's cool.

51:40.476 --> 51:42.808
- My grandmother...
- Clock out.

51:43.612 --> 51:45.773
Game's over. You lose.

51:46.615 --> 51:48.947
You never listen to nobody, man!

51:51.453 --> 51:53.944
Adiós. Why don't you...

51:54.123 --> 51:57.251
...send me some postcards?
Or call me on the phone, let me know...

51:57.326 --> 51:59.317
...how you're doing? We love you.

52:02.965 --> 52:04.956
Kimo Sabe this, cabrón!

52:12.141 --> 52:15.235
Pancho, that guy has a bigger problem
than you.

52:17.479 --> 52:20.141
Tic-tac-toe.

52:20.816 --> 52:21.714
Simple.

52:22.651 --> 52:26.143
No. She's a little sloppy
with her homework.

52:26.488 --> 52:28.513
Dad, get off the phone so we can eat.

52:29.992 --> 52:31.823
No, she's a top student.

52:33.328 --> 52:37.992
You're father works 60 hours a week,
then volunteers to teach night school.

52:38.167 --> 52:40.328
Merry Christmas to you, too.

52:42.738 --> 52:46.071
Now he's visiting junior high schools
in his spare time.

52:48.677 --> 52:50.338
Corn and potatoes?

52:50.546 --> 52:54.038
What happened to the lomo montado
pica a lo macho?

52:55.884 --> 52:59.047
Jaime, I don't want you to teach
this holiday.

53:02.191 --> 53:03.681
No teaching.

53:07.696 --> 53:09.857
I don't understand this problem.

53:10.199 --> 53:13.862
His own son has problems with math.
Give me that book.

53:13.969 --> 53:16.733
- No books at the table.
- Go wash your hands.

53:21.543 --> 53:22.874
I'll get it.

53:26.782 --> 53:28.374
You see what I mean?

53:50.172 --> 53:52.504
I've seen you do a lot
of underhanded tricks...

53:52.574 --> 53:57.068
...but bringing your abuelita
to my house at Christmastime, come on.

53:57.579 --> 54:00.412
I need calculus to take me
to a good career, Johnny.

54:02.417 --> 54:04.078
Something smells good.

54:11.093 --> 54:14.290
"On the first day of Christmas
A cholo came to me"

54:15.430 --> 54:17.421
This is what's given.

54:18.033 --> 54:21.434
We're looking for the area
in the first quadrant bounded by the curve.

54:21.503 --> 54:23.130
What are the limits? Anybody.

54:23.205 --> 54:24.797
0 to pi/2, sir.

54:24.973 --> 54:26.304
Wrong. Lupe.

54:26.675 --> 54:28.267
0 to pi/2?

54:29.444 --> 54:32.277
What is wrong with you? This is review.

54:32.481 --> 54:34.142
I checked my work twice.

54:34.516 --> 54:35.881
Check it again.

54:36.018 --> 54:37.952
I got the same answer as the gordita.

54:38.787 --> 54:40.618
Don't call me gordita, pendejo.

54:40.756 --> 54:42.747
It's 0 to pi/2, sir.

54:42.991 --> 54:44.982
Yeah, I got the same thing.

54:45.794 --> 54:50.458
You should know this!
What is wrong with you? This is review!

54:51.066 --> 54:53.227
You act like a blind man in a dark room...

54:53.402 --> 54:56.667
...looking for a black cat that isn't there!

54:57.306 --> 55:01.640
I don't believe it. It's giving me a shot
from the back! No way!

55:04.313 --> 55:06.543
Kimo finally blew a head gasket.

55:07.816 --> 55:09.477
It's a pen.

55:10.853 --> 55:12.411
It's a pencil.

55:14.156 --> 55:15.714
It's a chair.

55:16.992 --> 55:18.357
It's a light.

55:20.662 --> 55:22.220
It's a window.

55:23.899 --> 55:27.062
It's in the room, on the table.

55:27.669 --> 55:29.330
It's 10:00.

55:33.909 --> 55:35.240
Un momento, por favor.

55:35.344 --> 55:37.505
One moment, please.

56:32.334 --> 56:34.165
Page 456, please.

56:35.904 --> 56:38.065
Come on, Page 456.

56:38.307 --> 56:40.571
Shut up and sit down.

56:46.415 --> 56:48.076
We told him to take it easy.

56:48.317 --> 56:51.650
It's our fault.
We sit back and watch him burn in.

56:52.087 --> 56:53.748
It's "burn out."

56:54.756 --> 56:57.748
The man brought it on himself.
He was asking for trouble.

56:57.993 --> 56:59.324
How can you say that?

56:59.494 --> 57:01.257
You wanna-be cholo asshole.

57:05.767 --> 57:07.598
That's disgusting!

57:08.603 --> 57:10.935
You want me? I'll kick your ass!

57:11.273 --> 57:12.433
It's Molina!

57:12.774 --> 57:16.767
Break it up! Pancho, just break it up.

57:17.112 --> 57:18.272
Settle down.

57:18.380 --> 57:20.541
- Later, dude.
- Settle down, Angel.

57:26.822 --> 57:28.653
Mr. Escalante is okay.

57:29.925 --> 57:33.588
He had a mild heart attack
and he's under observation.

57:34.796 --> 57:37.287
Mr. Schloss is your substitute.

57:38.133 --> 57:42.968
Out of respect to Mr. Escalante,
please give him your undivided attention.

57:44.306 --> 57:46.968
I don't want any more trouble
from this room.

57:48.310 --> 57:51.108
Pancho, you come with me.
Angel, let's go.

57:54.716 --> 57:56.377
Tito, take your seat.

58:02.324 --> 58:04.952
Mr. Molina has informed me that...

58:05.160 --> 58:08.493
...you have your A.P. Calculus exam
in two weeks.

58:09.664 --> 58:13.657
To be honest, I've never taught calculus.
I'm really a music teacher.

58:28.083 --> 58:29.744
Are you mad at me, Mommy?

58:31.520 --> 58:34.182
If I thought it would help, I would be angry.

58:38.693 --> 58:40.854
The doctor says no stress.

58:41.196 --> 58:44.029
No job-related activity for at least a month.

58:44.366 --> 58:46.197
I want another doctor.

58:48.703 --> 58:52.366
I have to go.
I left Fernando with a neighbor.

58:52.607 --> 58:55.542
- I'll stay with Dad.
- No, go with your mother.

58:56.044 --> 58:58.706
Don't forget to take out the trash.

59:22.237 --> 59:24.228
What time do you get off work?

59:55.170 --> 59:57.832
I'm still alive! I'm a hard-dying guy.

59:58.106 --> 59:59.869
Shouldn't you be in the hospital?

59:59.941 --> 01:00:02.102
No, I should be here with you.

01:00:02.577 --> 01:00:03.908
Bulldogs!

01:00:04.346 --> 01:00:06.109
Dog, dog, dog, dog.

01:00:08.283 --> 01:00:10.615
Thank you for baby-sitting my canguros.

01:00:11.219 --> 01:00:12.709
Have a good day.

01:00:12.854 --> 01:00:14.446
How are you?

01:00:14.856 --> 01:00:16.289
You should take it easy.

01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:18.459
Go back to bed, man.

01:00:18.693 --> 01:00:20.524
No, I should be here with you.

01:00:20.795 --> 01:00:24.094
You already forgot to stand up!
Everybody!

01:00:25.467 --> 01:00:28.436
No, against the wall like a snake! Hurry!

01:00:29.804 --> 01:00:33.638
We've practiced for this all year.
You're the best!

01:00:34.476 --> 01:00:36.467
You guys are the best!

01:00:36.811 --> 01:00:38.369
This will be a piece of cake!

01:00:38.813 --> 01:00:39.871
Upside down.

01:00:40.882 --> 01:00:41.906
And...

01:00:42.784 --> 01:00:44.149
Step by step.

01:00:44.486 --> 01:00:47.319
You got it now. Open your eyes.

01:00:49.357 --> 01:00:52.520
Y = In...

01:00:53.161 --> 01:00:55.994
...(x - 1). What is the domain?

01:00:56.164 --> 01:00:57.825
X > - 1.

01:00:58.166 --> 01:01:01.397
No! End of the line!
I'm gone two days and you forget.

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:02.898
What's the domain?

01:01:02.971 --> 01:01:06.202
All real numbers greater than one. X > 1.

01:01:07.175 --> 01:01:10.167
I told you, you could do it. Okay!

01:01:13.381 --> 01:01:17.875
Be sure each mark is black
and completely filled-in.

01:01:18.053 --> 01:01:19.645
If you make an error...

01:01:19.721 --> 01:01:23.248
...save time by crossing it out
instead of erasing.

01:01:23.892 --> 01:01:28.386
It is not expected that you will
answer all multiple choice questions.

01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:31.392
When you're told to begin,
open your booklet.

01:01:31.633 --> 01:01:36.070
Tear out the green insert and start work.
You may begin.

01:02:07.335 --> 01:02:08.768
Let's go!

01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:30.349
I like to keep my pants dry.

01:02:34.296 --> 01:02:36.958
The water is great! Come on!

01:02:39.467 --> 01:02:41.298
Okay, fine!

01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:43.961
This is so stupid!

01:02:44.306 --> 01:02:45.637
I'm coming!

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:16.831
Orale, Grandpa!

01:04:09.391 --> 01:04:11.552
We, being teachers...

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:16.394
...know the Advanced Placement Tests
are very difficult...

01:04:16.898 --> 01:04:19.059
...especially in mathematics.

01:04:20.235 --> 01:04:24.569
Less than two percent
of all high school seniors nationwide...

01:04:24.906 --> 01:04:29.240
...even attempt
the Advanced Placement Calculus Test.

01:04:30.979 --> 01:04:32.071
You've been drinking!

01:04:32.147 --> 01:04:35.082
I am proud to announce...

01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:39.242
...that no other high school
in Southern California...

01:04:39.487 --> 01:04:41.148
...has more students passing...

01:04:41.756 --> 01:04:43.417
...than Garfield High School.

01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:50.591
No, he just walks like that.

01:04:52.434 --> 01:04:56.268
Eighteen students took the test.
Eighteen passed.

01:05:00.108 --> 01:05:02.599
We have an announcement to make.

01:05:11.619 --> 01:05:14.452
We, the A.P. Calculus Class...

01:05:14.856 --> 01:05:18.622
...would like to present this plaque
to our teacher...

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.292
...Jaime A. Escalante.

01:06:12.547 --> 01:06:14.879
Yes, this is Guadalupe Escobar.

01:06:17.318 --> 01:06:19.149
Is this some kind of joke?

01:06:20.188 --> 01:06:22.019
Who is this?

01:06:23.825 --> 01:06:25.315
For real?

01:06:27.195 --> 01:06:28.526
What?

01:06:29.030 --> 01:06:30.691
You're crazy, man.

01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:44.868
"Tests are graded with the identity
of the student concealed.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.477
"Only after irregularities were found
was it determined...

01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:53.214
"...that all the students were
from Garfield High." You all got this?

01:06:54.722 --> 01:06:57.714
"Based upon the unusual agreement
of incorrect answers...

01:06:57.959 --> 01:07:00.450
"...E.T.S. Must question the scores...

01:07:00.562 --> 01:07:03.224
"...of all students with
such unusual agreement."

01:07:03.731 --> 01:07:05.892
What does it mean in English?

01:07:06.134 --> 01:07:09.535
They think we cheated because
we all had the same wrong answers.

01:07:09.771 --> 01:07:12.433
We're too stupid
to know how to cheat correctly.

01:07:13.007 --> 01:07:14.338
Let's sue them.

01:07:14.475 --> 01:07:20.641
"The board doubts the grades are valid
because of these unusual circumstances."

01:07:20.915 --> 01:07:23.645
These people are human.
They can make mistakes.

01:07:24.919 --> 01:07:28.252
Kimo, these people are calling us cheaters.

01:07:31.025 --> 01:07:33.516
This is where we keep
all confidential material...

01:07:33.595 --> 01:07:35.961
...S.A.T. And A.P. Tests included.

01:07:38.232 --> 01:07:41.326
Only my secretary and I know
the combination.

01:07:44.272 --> 01:07:49.437
This controversy is officially
between the E.T.S. And the students.

01:07:49.611 --> 01:07:53.411
It does not reflect upon your school
or its administration.

01:07:55.116 --> 01:07:58.279
We'd like to resolve this
with as little publicity as possible.

01:07:58.386 --> 01:07:59.683
I'd appreciate that.

01:08:09.464 --> 01:08:12.297
You think they got the test ahead of time?

01:08:14.469 --> 01:08:17.131
Claudia was having emotional problems.

01:08:17.471 --> 01:08:19.633
Pancho was way behind.

01:08:21.142 --> 01:08:23.133
Do you really think anyone cheated?

01:08:25.313 --> 01:08:26.473
No.

01:08:26.781 --> 01:08:28.612
But my father does.

01:08:30.917 --> 01:08:32.475
Damn shit!

01:08:34.122 --> 01:08:35.783
Look at this shit!

01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:40.323
If I'd taken that job with my uncle,
I'd have a new car by now!

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.428
It's all right. You can fix it.

01:08:43.831 --> 01:08:46.493
You can fix it. Just relax.

01:08:46.734 --> 01:08:49.167
I didn't know you two were a thing now.

01:08:52.305 --> 01:08:53.738
Just something for the summer.

01:09:01.683 --> 01:09:03.674
You're an asshole, Pancho.

01:09:07.354 --> 01:09:08.515
Shit!

01:09:20.468 --> 01:09:23.631
Lots of stars up there, homey.
Not too polluted.

01:09:23.871 --> 01:09:26.533
The stars aren't really there, ese.

01:09:29.877 --> 01:09:33.040
What you're looking at
is where they used to be.

01:09:34.082 --> 01:09:35.743
It takes the light...

01:09:35.883 --> 01:09:38.215
...1,000 years to reach the earth.

01:09:38.786 --> 01:09:41.948
For all we know,
they burned out a long time ago.

01:09:42.023 --> 01:09:45.652
God pulled the plug on us.
He didn't tell nobody.

01:09:46.728 --> 01:09:50.220
The stars are out there, homeboy.
I don't care what you say.

01:09:58.406 --> 01:09:59.805
Hey, homeboy!

01:10:05.246 --> 01:10:07.407
Throw me a kiss, baby!

01:10:18.092 --> 01:10:20.925
That's right! That's all you know.

01:10:26.434 --> 01:10:28.095
Can't you afford a knife?

01:10:28.436 --> 01:10:30.768
Use a pencil, go to jail.

01:10:31.105 --> 01:10:35.098
You've got a tough mouth.
You better watch yourself.

01:10:38.946 --> 01:10:41.107
Mucho gusto, officer.

01:11:03.638 --> 01:11:05.799
That was real smart, ese!

01:11:09.076 --> 01:11:10.907
Get away from my ride!

01:11:15.249 --> 01:11:16.409
Get up!

01:11:17.051 --> 01:11:18.313
Get up!

01:11:27.662 --> 01:11:28.993
Where are you going?

01:11:30.832 --> 01:11:32.060
Come back!

01:12:20.948 --> 01:12:24.384
Well, does anyone have anything to say?

01:12:47.074 --> 01:12:49.235
I've known your family for years.

01:12:50.077 --> 01:12:51.908
Tell us the truth.

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:54.241
Nothing happened.

01:12:54.916 --> 01:12:57.476
- Don't lie to me.
- Nothing happened!

01:12:57.752 --> 01:13:01.085
Leave her alone.
She didn't do anything wrong.

01:13:01.322 --> 01:13:02.914
Then tell us who did.

01:13:17.271 --> 01:13:18.932
We're not cops.

01:13:20.374 --> 01:13:22.968
We're not here to put anybody behind bars.

01:13:24.111 --> 01:13:26.944
If you cheated,
let us know so you can go home...

01:13:27.281 --> 01:13:29.613
...and enjoy the rest of your summer.

01:13:47.902 --> 01:13:49.893
I come from this neighborhood.

01:13:53.975 --> 01:13:58.071
I know that sometimes we're tempted
to take shortcuts.

01:13:59.647 --> 01:14:02.138
Tell me the truth. What happened?

01:14:23.437 --> 01:14:25.428
We're busted. Let's admit it.

01:14:37.618 --> 01:14:38.744
How did you do it?

01:14:43.357 --> 01:14:46.190
I got the test ahead of time
and passed it out.

01:14:47.061 --> 01:14:48.221
How did you get it?

01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:50.728
The mailman.

01:14:54.535 --> 01:14:57.163
I strangled him.
His body's decomposing in my locker.

01:15:37.244 --> 01:15:40.236
No sense in continuing
if they won't cooperate.

01:16:02.169 --> 01:16:04.137
Do you know how this got in my box?

01:16:12.913 --> 01:16:14.744
A letter of resignation.

01:16:15.116 --> 01:16:16.447
Anonymous.

01:16:19.453 --> 01:16:24.288
My guess is that it has something to do
with the mess this school is in.

01:16:27.495 --> 01:16:28.985
Do you think the students cheated?

01:16:37.304 --> 01:16:41.968
Mr. Escalante, you put these kids
under an awful lot of pressure.

01:16:43.644 --> 01:16:46.306
They would have gone to any lengths
to please you.

01:16:46.981 --> 01:16:48.972
You didn't answer my question.

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:03.688
Every night I watch the news on Tv.
I see a lot of people go on trial.

01:17:04.732 --> 01:17:09.396
They deny everything or their lawyers say
they were insane when they did it.

01:17:09.637 --> 01:17:11.628
A lot of them get off.

01:17:14.008 --> 01:17:18.001
But I believe most people
who get caught today are guilty...

01:17:20.447 --> 01:17:21.880
...don't you?

01:17:24.518 --> 01:17:26.679
Yep, I know what you mean.

01:17:51.679 --> 01:17:53.169
Have you seen my car?

01:17:54.381 --> 01:17:56.042
Do you need a ride home?

01:18:02.489 --> 01:18:03.786
No, thank you!

01:18:06.527 --> 01:18:08.518
Kimo, let me take you home!

01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:25.131
Want to talk about it?

01:19:33.147 --> 01:19:37.311
I may have made a mistake trying
to teach them calculus.

01:19:40.621 --> 01:19:43.784
Regardless of whether they passed
that test or not...

01:19:45.793 --> 01:19:47.192
...they learned.

01:19:48.996 --> 01:19:52.989
They learned if you try real hard,
nothing changes.

01:19:57.638 --> 01:19:58.730
Quit.

01:20:01.508 --> 01:20:03.669
If that's all you have left to teach...

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:07.669
...quit.

01:20:10.984 --> 01:20:12.645
What kills me...

01:20:14.188 --> 01:20:16.520
...is that they lost the confidence...

01:20:16.857 --> 01:20:20.850
...in the system they are now
finally qualified to be a part of.

01:20:23.864 --> 01:20:28.198
I don't know why I'm losing sleep over this.
I don't need it.

01:20:30.704 --> 01:20:33.867
I could make twice the money
and less hours...

01:20:34.308 --> 01:20:36.799
...and have people treat me with respect.

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:40.711
Respect?

01:20:43.884 --> 01:20:46.148
Jaime, those kids love you.

01:20:56.663 --> 01:20:58.221
Hey, Kimo!

01:21:07.241 --> 01:21:10.404
Check out your ride!
We fixed it up for you.

01:21:10.744 --> 01:21:15.113
It's going downtown
to take action on those E.T.S. Boys.

01:21:16.583 --> 01:21:18.414
Dad, check out your new car!

01:21:18.952 --> 01:21:21.284
We got to talk about the payments,
though.

01:21:44.077 --> 01:21:48.411
I'm Jaime Escalante. I'm the A.P.
Calculus teacher from Garfield High.

01:21:51.585 --> 01:21:53.246
I'm Dr. Pearson...

01:21:53.921 --> 01:21:55.912
...and this is Dr. Ramirez.

01:22:04.698 --> 01:22:08.862
I feel I have a right to know
why you think my students cheated.

01:22:15.108 --> 01:22:18.771
I'm sorry you drove all the way out here...

01:22:19.179 --> 01:22:21.841
...but we're not at liberty
to discuss the controversy.

01:22:22.115 --> 01:22:24.777
I'd just like to see the test, that's all.

01:22:27.054 --> 01:22:30.046
I understand what you're going through...

01:22:30.691 --> 01:22:34.684
...but the problem is between the E.T.S.
And the students.

01:22:35.128 --> 01:22:37.790
I'd just like to see
what kind of mistakes were made.

01:22:37.865 --> 01:22:40.698
I'm their teacher. I know my kids.

01:22:42.970 --> 01:22:44.631
Mr. Escalante, have a seat.

01:22:45.138 --> 01:22:46.366
No, thank you.

01:22:49.476 --> 01:22:51.137
There were some...

01:22:51.478 --> 01:22:55.471
...unorthodox, even illogical, computations
for students of this caliber.

01:22:55.916 --> 01:22:57.577
Mistakes in simple math.

01:22:57.818 --> 01:23:02.084
Because they have the same teacher
teaching them the same program.

01:23:02.222 --> 01:23:04.884
I taught them step by step,
all the same way.

01:23:05.325 --> 01:23:09.921
Your students averaged fewer than
four wrong on the multiple choice...

01:23:10.130 --> 01:23:14.294
...where other schools average
14 to 18 incorrect answers.

01:23:14.868 --> 01:23:17.962
Most of your kids finished
with time to spare.

01:23:18.906 --> 01:23:20.999
They should be rewarded, not punished.

01:23:25.345 --> 01:23:27.836
The Educational Testing Service...

01:23:28.348 --> 01:23:30.680
...does not act capriciously.

01:23:31.785 --> 01:23:35.016
Every major university in the US
subscribes to our service.

01:23:35.322 --> 01:23:39.486
I'd just like to see proof of wrongdoing.
I'd like to see the tests.

01:23:39.693 --> 01:23:43.527
There is no proof of wrongdoing,
only a suspicion of cheating.

01:23:43.864 --> 01:23:45.092
In this country...

01:23:45.232 --> 01:23:47.894
...one is innocent until proven guilty.
Not vice versa.

01:23:48.869 --> 01:23:53.363
If you are so confident of their abilities,
encourage them to retest.

01:23:53.874 --> 01:23:55.034
Why?

01:23:55.375 --> 01:23:58.435
If they don't,
everyone will assume they cheated.

01:23:58.779 --> 01:24:01.771
Everyone will assume
they cheated if they do.

01:24:02.049 --> 01:24:03.710
I want to see the test!

01:24:04.051 --> 01:24:08.886
Mr. Escalante, we are psychometricians,
thorough to the point of boring.

01:24:09.222 --> 01:24:10.883
We're not out to get anyone.

01:24:11.058 --> 01:24:11.752
Wait.

01:24:12.225 --> 01:24:15.285
A situation of two students
cheating is one thing.

01:24:16.029 --> 01:24:20.022
This blanket accusation is saying
there was a conspiracy.

01:24:20.233 --> 01:24:22.258
Every conspiracy has a leader.

01:24:22.336 --> 01:24:24.896
Who better qualify to be the leader
than the teacher?

01:24:24.972 --> 01:24:27.133
Nobody is accusing you here of anything.

01:24:27.407 --> 01:24:31.070
Not only me, the school, the parents,
the entire community!

01:24:31.311 --> 01:24:35.145
Scores this high would be questioned
regardless of the school.

01:24:35.415 --> 01:24:39.249
But if this was Beverly Hills High
they wouldn't have sent you to investigate.

01:24:42.756 --> 01:24:47.591
I hope you're not insinuating
that we haven't earned our position here.

01:24:48.428 --> 01:24:50.658
No one has given me a damn thing.

01:24:51.598 --> 01:24:55.261
You are letting your emotions
get the best of you.

01:24:55.769 --> 01:25:00.433
If no one gave you a damn thing,
you shouldn't take away from my kids!

01:25:00.674 --> 01:25:04.269
The identity of the students
was concealed...

01:25:04.511 --> 01:25:07.776
...until it was determined
that irregularities existed.

01:25:08.281 --> 01:25:13.116
No one would have questioned the scores
if my kids didn't have Spanish surnames...

01:25:13.353 --> 01:25:16.015
...and come from barrio schools!

01:25:17.958 --> 01:25:22.793
All right. We've explained our position
and heard your complaints, but now...

01:25:23.130 --> 01:25:24.859
...our conversation is over.

01:25:25.265 --> 01:25:28.257
Something is going on
that nobody is talking about.

01:25:28.468 --> 01:25:30.129
And you know what it is!

01:25:32.973 --> 01:25:37.808
No one has the right to accuse me
of racism. No one has that right!

01:25:38.211 --> 01:25:40.543
I know well how to spell discrimination!

01:25:40.881 --> 01:25:45.147
I thought this was over long ago.
Why do this to my kids?

01:25:45.819 --> 01:25:48.982
There are two kinds of racism,
Mr. Escalante.

01:25:49.423 --> 01:25:52.119
Singling out a group
who are members of a minority...

01:25:52.192 --> 01:25:55.184
...and not singling out a group
who are members of a minority.

01:25:55.595 --> 01:25:58.325
My kids could teach you
a thing or two, Johnny!

01:25:59.132 --> 01:26:01.965
I'll call security
if you can't control yourself.

01:26:02.069 --> 01:26:02.899
Do it!

01:26:04.137 --> 01:26:08.267
You didn't prove anything.
My kids didn't do anything!

01:26:08.408 --> 01:26:10.239
I'll prove you guys wrong.

01:26:10.677 --> 01:26:14.374
I hope you do
because this is not between you and me.

01:26:16.683 --> 01:26:17.877
Maybe not.

01:26:18.485 --> 01:26:22.444
But if I catch you on the street,
I'll kick the shit out of you.

01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:29.021
This is Guadalupe Escobar.

01:26:29.596 --> 01:26:31.587
I'm going to take the test again.

01:26:32.666 --> 01:26:33.997
You're kidding!

01:26:34.801 --> 01:26:37.031
Kimo, we only have one day to study.

01:26:42.542 --> 01:26:45.033
8:00 a.m. On Tuesday. Thank you.

01:26:45.812 --> 01:26:47.473
You didn't let me talk to them.

01:26:47.614 --> 01:26:49.946
Call collect. Stick them with a big bill.

01:26:54.054 --> 01:26:56.614
Thought I'd seen this place
for the last time.

01:26:59.559 --> 01:27:03.051
We'll have to review the whole course
in one shot.

01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:06.021
- In one day?
- Can't do it in any less.

01:27:06.233 --> 01:27:08.224
Maybe they'll give us the same test.

01:27:09.236 --> 01:27:12.569
It will be harder. You can count on that.

01:27:14.407 --> 01:27:17.399
Just go step by step and play defense.

01:27:18.578 --> 01:27:22.571
Don't bring anything.
No pencils, no erasers, nothing.

01:27:23.083 --> 01:27:25.916
Don't wear clothes with too many pockets.

01:27:26.586 --> 01:27:30.078
Don't let your eyes wander.
No spacing out.

01:27:30.757 --> 01:27:33.920
Don't give them any opportunity
to call you cheaters.

01:27:35.929 --> 01:27:38.159
You are the true dreamers.

01:27:38.932 --> 01:27:41.594
And dreams accomplish wonderful things.

01:27:42.836 --> 01:27:44.497
You're the best.

01:27:44.871 --> 01:27:47.704
Tomorrow you'll prove
that you're the champs.

01:27:49.109 --> 01:27:50.940
Start with Chapter 1.

01:28:04.291 --> 01:28:06.452
Kimo, what you making there?

01:28:06.626 --> 01:28:11.461
You like brains? Good. I was afraid
you guys wouldn't appreciate it.

01:28:11.965 --> 01:28:14.456
This food lasts for 24-hours.

01:28:15.135 --> 01:28:17.968
You're afraid we're going
to screw up royally tomorrow.

01:28:19.406 --> 01:28:21.067
Tomorrow is just another day.

01:28:21.308 --> 01:28:24.300
I'm afraid you'll screw up
the rest of your lives.

01:28:31.885 --> 01:28:34.877
I'm fried. I don't care
if I don't pass that test.

01:28:35.155 --> 01:28:38.488
- Sit down. We got a lot of work to do.
- I'm going home.

01:28:40.994 --> 01:28:42.325
Sit down.

01:28:42.996 --> 01:28:45.988
I'm tired and I'm going home. Okay?

01:28:46.499 --> 01:28:50.333
- Do you know what you're doing?
- I'm going home, that's what.

01:29:01.014 --> 01:29:03.175
It's almost ready. Who wants some?

01:29:03.617 --> 01:29:05.448
Let's order out, man.

01:29:06.419 --> 01:29:07.750
Just kidding.

01:30:01.908 --> 01:30:03.569
I had to see you.

01:30:04.311 --> 01:30:07.803
You can't expect me to be your girlfriend
at your convenience.

01:30:14.587 --> 01:30:15.986
I'm an asshole.

01:30:19.426 --> 01:30:20.586
Sorry.

01:31:24.290 --> 01:31:27.953
I'm sure you're all familiar
with the procedure.

01:31:29.095 --> 01:31:33.759
You have 90 minutes to complete
the multiple choice section.

01:31:34.267 --> 01:31:36.758
Do not fill in answers by guessing.

01:31:37.003 --> 01:31:39.494
Wrong answers will be counted
against you.

01:31:40.673 --> 01:31:43.335
You may begin Part 1, now.

01:33:14.934 --> 01:33:16.765
Okay, pencils down.

01:33:22.642 --> 01:33:26.134
You have 90 minutes to complete
the free-response section.

01:33:26.846 --> 01:33:30.577
Do not spend too much time
on any particular answer.

01:33:32.418 --> 01:33:35.410
Credit will be issued for partial solutions.

01:33:36.956 --> 01:33:40.448
Open the booklet, begin Part 2. Good luck.

01:35:23.129 --> 01:35:25.620
- Finished?
- No, I can't finish the test.

01:35:26.566 --> 01:35:30.400
I have a scholarship appointment at U.S.C.

01:35:30.903 --> 01:35:33.201
- Can't that wait?
- No, it can't.

01:35:35.975 --> 01:35:37.806
Did you fill out your ID card?

01:35:50.757 --> 01:35:52.748
Okay, pencils down.

01:36:24.957 --> 01:36:28.290
Did you hear the news?
We got the computers.

01:36:28.961 --> 01:36:30.792
Yep, that'll do it.

01:36:50.683 --> 01:36:55.017
They want to go over the test again
so that there's no misunderstandings.

01:37:00.493 --> 01:37:02.825
I'm on my way to the faculty meeting.

01:37:03.329 --> 01:37:05.490
Misunderstanding again?

01:37:06.065 --> 01:37:08.727
Call Dr. Ramirez. He'll help us.

01:37:08.901 --> 01:37:10.994
He'll tell me the same thing.

01:37:12.438 --> 01:37:14.099
All right, I'll call him.

01:37:32.024 --> 01:37:35.858
This is Mr. Molina calling again.
Can I speak to...

01:37:36.829 --> 01:37:38.057
Yes, I did.

01:37:39.165 --> 01:37:40.598
You do?

01:37:42.368 --> 01:37:45.201
Yes! I'd like that very much.

01:37:46.205 --> 01:37:47.536
One moment.

01:37:49.208 --> 01:37:51.938
Yes, I'm aware of the scoring.

01:37:52.044 --> 01:37:55.207
Three is a passing grade,
five is a perfect grade.

01:37:55.615 --> 01:37:57.276
I'm ready. Go ahead.

01:37:57.717 --> 01:38:00.379
Diaz, Maria, four.

01:38:01.053 --> 01:38:03.544
Sinfuentes, Mark, five.

01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:06.881
Narvarra, Jose, four.

01:38:07.393 --> 01:38:09.884
I want the original scores reinstated.

01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:12.060
Santos, Daniel, four.

01:38:12.732 --> 01:38:14.893
Escobar, Guadalupe, five.

01:38:16.402 --> 01:38:18.393
Camejo, Claudia, four.

01:38:19.372 --> 01:38:21.363
Ana Delgado, four.

01:38:22.642 --> 01:38:24.803
Garcia, Francisco, three.

01:38:25.244 --> 01:38:27.576
Fuentes, Rafaela, four.

01:38:29.081 --> 01:38:31.072
Javier Perales, five.

01:38:31.984 --> 01:38:34.316
Guitaro, Armando, four.

01:38:35.988 --> 01:38:37.478
Angel Guzman...

01:38:38.591 --> 01:38:39.751
...five.

01:38:40.726 --> 01:38:44.059
Tell them to hold the meeting.
We have great news.

01:38:44.597 --> 01:38:46.929
Pernajas, Juliana, five.

01:38:48.434 --> 01:38:50.766
Hernandez, Alejandro, four.
