00:08.509 --> 00:11.377
HA!  TAKE THAT, MUNCH!

00:11.379 --> 00:13.379
WHY DID YOU KILL ME?

00:13.381 --> 00:15.414
WE ARE TEAMMATES.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.649
NOT ANYMORE.
YOU'RE DEAD.

00:19.253 --> 00:22.855
PARKER, ARE YOU EXCITED?
IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR AGAIN.

00:22.857 --> 00:25.891
IT'S MY HALF-BIRTHDAY?
WHERE'S MY HALF-CAKE
AND HALF-GIFT?

00:25.893 --> 00:29.528
NO, NO, EVEN BETTER.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.965
IT'S TIME FOR "THE MAMA'S
SWEET BABY BOY PAGEANT."

00:34.268 --> 00:36.468
THE MOTHERS OF STEVENS POINT

00:36.470 --> 00:39.371
HAVE A PAGEANT
WHERE WE PARADE IN COSTUME

00:39.373 --> 00:40.906
WITH OUR YOUNGEST SONS.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.941
OH!
BEST DAY OF THE YEAR!

00:42.943 --> 00:45.544
WORST DAY OF THE YEAR,

00:45.546 --> 00:48.213
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
TO MY MOM SO I SUCK IT UP

00:48.215 --> 00:50.582
AND DIE A LITTLE INSIDE.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.518
MOM USED TO MAKE ME
DO THE PAGEANT,

00:52.520 --> 00:55.287
BUT THEN THERE WAS A NEW BABY
BOY FOR HER TO DRESS
LIKE A DOLL.

00:55.289 --> 00:59.224
NOW I GO TO LAUGH AND TAKE
LOTS AND LOTS OF PICTURES.

00:59.226 --> 01:03.295
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE SEVEN
AND THE THEME WAS "MYSTERIES
OF THE OCEAN"?

01:03.297 --> 01:05.364
MY FAVORITE.

01:07.802 --> 01:10.335
<i>( laughs )</i>
<i>OH, LOOK AT MY LITTLE SAILOR.</i>

01:11.572 --> 01:14.907
SO THIS YEAR'S THEME
IS "BEYOND THE ARCTIC CIRCLE."

01:14.909 --> 01:16.875
NOW MAMA PULLED A FEW STRINGS

01:16.877 --> 01:19.978
SO YOU GET TO BE THE NARWHAL.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.482
CAN I GET A NAR-WHAT-WHAT?

01:23.484 --> 01:26.018
WHOO!  WHOO!

01:26.020 --> 01:30.022
THIS IS A NARWHAL.
I KNOW IT'S TECHNICALLY A WHALE,

01:30.024 --> 01:33.325
BUT LET'S BE HONEST.
IT'S A SEA UNICORN.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.726
I'VE GOTTA GET OUT
OF THIS PAGEANT.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.995

02:44.665 --> 02:46.331

WHAT?

12:25.045 --> 12:29.114
IF YOU LOVED ME,
YOU WOULD KNOW.

12:32.652 --> 12:35.954
♪ I ONCE WAS LOST ♪

12:35.956 --> 12:39.224
♪ BUT NOW I'M-- ♪

12:39.226 --> 12:40.091

12:40.093 --> 12:43.228

12:43.230 --> 12:46.131
THANK YOU.
( retches )

12:48.502 --> 12:51.469
OH, WOW, OKAY.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.474
GUYS, I CAN CRACK MY OWN CLAW.

13:03.416 --> 13:06.351
YOU'RE NOT GONNA CHEW
FOR ME, TOO?

13:10.490 --> 13:12.657
MINIONS SEEM LIKE A GOOD IDEA

13:12.659 --> 13:15.527
UNTIL THEY ARE SMOTHERING YOU
ALL DAY LONG.

13:15.529 --> 13:17.695
APPLYING YOUR DEODORANT
AFTER GYM.

13:17.697 --> 13:20.698
POPPING BLACKHEADS
ON YOUR FOREHEAD.

13:20.700 --> 13:23.434
HANDING YOU TOILET PAPER
UNDER THE STALL.

13:23.436 --> 13:27.438
GRANTED, IT WAS SIX PLY
AND REALLY SOFT ON MY BOTTOM.

13:27.440 --> 13:31.075
BUT STILL,
A MAN NEEDS HIS SPACE.

13:32.412 --> 13:35.113
STOP IT.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.614
( whirring )

13:36.616 --> 13:40.518
OKAY, REALLY, NONE OF THIS
IS WEIRD FOR YOU GUYS?

13:41.988 --> 13:43.521
GET OFF ME, GET OFF ME,
GET OFF ME, GET OFF ME.

13:44.457 --> 13:47.058
ARTIE!

13:47.060 --> 13:50.495
I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.564
HEY, MINIONS.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.068
DUDE, YOU HAVE TO
TAKE THEM BACK.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.303
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE COOL,

13:58.305 --> 14:02.140
BUT I AM JUST NOT
A MINION MAN, MAN.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.776
JOEY, MINIONS CANNOT BE
GIVEN AWAY.

14:04.778 --> 14:06.244
THEY MUST BE WON BACK.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.413
I WON THEM FROM NEVILLE HOSAKA

14:08.415 --> 14:11.049
IN A VICIOUS GAME OF HOPSCOTCH.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.618
AND NOW YOU'VE WON THEM
FROM ME.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.087
FINE, THEN WE'LL
JUST HAVE A REMATCH

14:16.089 --> 14:18.423
SO YOU CAN WIN THEM BACK
FAIR AND SQUARE.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.191
I'LL HAVE THE MINIONS
SET IT UP.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.360
YOU'D DO THAT?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.230
BLESS YOU, BROTHER!

14:27.100 --> 14:28.766
<i>( playing blues tune</i>
<i>on harmonica )</i>

14:38.378 --> 14:41.179
DUMP TRUCK,
WHERE'S THE NOOB?

14:41.181 --> 14:45.083
I SENT HIM TO SCRAPE
THE GUM OFF FROM UNDER
EVERY DESK IN SCHOOL, BOSS.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.819
A JOB LIKE THAT COULD
BREAK A MAN.  GREAT WORK.

14:49.789 --> 14:53.358
YEAH, I BET HE'S CURLED UP
UNDER ONE OF THEM DESKS
RIGHT NOW, SOBBING.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.793
LISTENING FOR CRYING, BOSS?

14:57.297 --> 14:59.197
LISTENING FOR CRYING.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.840
GUM SCRAPED.

15:08.842 --> 15:10.475
WHAT'S NEXT?

15:10.477 --> 15:12.143
WHOA!

15:12.145 --> 15:14.612
YOU SCRAPED ALL
THIS GUM YOURSELF?

15:14.614 --> 15:18.149
WELL, I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
I WAS MAN ENOUGH FOR DETENTION.

15:18.151 --> 15:20.518
NO.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.487
YOU'RE NO MAN.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.155
YOU'RE A MACHINE.

15:25.725 --> 15:29.227
HOW ABOUT A ROUND OF
APPLAUSE FOR THE GUMBALL
MACHINE, HUH?

15:31.164 --> 15:34.365
I STARTED THE WEEK AS A LOWLY
MIDDLE SCHOOL NOOB.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.200
NOW I WAS THE GUMBALL MACHINE.

15:36.202 --> 15:39.337
I HAD BROKEN THE ICE,
LIKE THE HORN OF THE NARWHAL.

15:39.339 --> 15:43.274
NO WAIT.
NOT A NARWHAL, NEVER A NARWHAL.

15:44.811 --> 15:48.813
SUPERINTENDENT KNEEBAUER,
I HAVE COME TO BEG
FOR YOUR MERCY.

15:48.815 --> 15:51.182
PARKER'S MY SWEET BABY BOY.

15:51.184 --> 15:54.419
OH, HE DONE WRONG,
BUT HE PAID THE PRICE.

15:54.421 --> 15:58.523
CAN YOU FIND IT IN YOUR HEART
TO SET HIM FREE TOMORROW?

15:58.525 --> 16:00.525
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:00.527 --> 16:02.760
I THINK HE'S LEARNED HIS LESSON.

16:02.762 --> 16:05.263
THIS IS YOUR LAST DAY
OF DETENTION, GUMBALL MACHINE.

16:05.265 --> 16:09.233
NO, NO, NO.
NOT A FAN OF HUMAN CONTACT.

16:09.235 --> 16:10.702
DID YOU HEAR THAT, SWEETIE?

16:10.704 --> 16:14.272
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT
TO THE PAGEANT AFTER ALL.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.574
OR I'M GOING TO ROB A BANK

16:16.576 --> 16:18.643
AND GO TO ACTUAL JAIL.

16:18.645 --> 16:22.280
IT'S GOT TO BE BETTER
THAN LAST YEAR'S PAGEANT.
( shudders )

16:32.459 --> 16:33.891
GUMBALL MACHINE,

16:33.893 --> 16:36.294
WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER YOUR TIME

16:36.296 --> 16:38.529
IN THE JOINT. ( spits )

16:38.531 --> 16:40.598
GUM ME.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.605
YOU SHOWED ME SOMETHING,
LITTLE GUY.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.611
THIS IS THE GROSSEST PIECE
OF AWESOME

16:53.613 --> 16:54.846
I'VE EVER HELD.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.318
BUT I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.988
THAT'S WHEN I TOLD THE GUYS
ABOUT "MAMA'S SWEET
BABY BOY PAGEANT."

17:03.990 --> 17:07.191
IT WAS HUMILIATING,
BUT THEY GOT IT.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.694
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT
IDENTICAL ORANGE JUMPSUITS

17:09.696 --> 17:11.396
THAT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.464
A WHALE WITH A POINTY HORN?!

17:14.601 --> 17:15.967
THAT'S NOT RIGHT,
GUMBALL MACHINE.

17:15.969 --> 17:18.202
THAT AIN'T RIGHT AT ALL.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.804
EXACTLY.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.973
WHICH IS WHY I NEED YOUR HELP
TO STAY IN DETENTION.

17:21.975 --> 17:24.375
WHAT CAN WE DO?

17:27.680 --> 17:29.781
( snoring )

17:32.419 --> 17:36.254
WE CAN GIVE KNEEBAUER
A WAKE UP CALL.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.656
YOU DO THE HONORS.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.325
( snoring )

17:47.500 --> 17:50.001
( screams )

17:51.738 --> 17:54.572
WHEN I GET DOWN FROM HERE,

17:54.573 --> 17:57.407
YOU LITTLE PUNKS ARE GONNA
BE IN DETENTION THE REST
OF YOUR WORTHLESS LIVES!

18:06.986 --> 18:08.519
YOU'RE LATE.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.022
MY MINIONS USUALLY SERVE
AS MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM.

18:11.024 --> 18:13.624
I GOT LOST THREE TIMES
ON THE WAY HERE.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.993
SOME HUNTERS FOUND ME WANDERING
IN THE WOODS.

18:18.031 --> 18:21.432
YEAH, WHATEVER, WEIRDO.
COME ON, LET'S DO THIS.

18:29.509 --> 18:32.276
OKAY, COME ON, JUST HIT ME
ONCE AND I'LL TAKE A DIVE.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.544
KENDO UP.

18:36.683 --> 18:40.318
AVERT YOUR EYES, MINIONS.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO REMEMBER
ME LIKE THIS.

18:45.024 --> 18:47.892
IS HE ALLOWED TO DO THAT?

18:47.894 --> 18:51.395
HE'S BREAKING ALL THE RULES
OF MINIONHOOD...

18:51.397 --> 18:54.298
FOR ME.

18:54.300 --> 18:58.002
I FEEL MY STRENGTH RETURNING.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.770
OKAY, IT'S JUST LIKE,

18:59.772 --> 19:01.906
IF THERE ARE "RULES"
OF MINIONHOOD--

19:01.908 --> 19:04.876
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT,
JOEY.  DON'T RUIN IT.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.990
( grunting )

19:39.846 --> 19:42.046
( cheering )

19:43.917 --> 19:44.982
THE KING IS BACK!

19:44.984 --> 19:48.853
- MINIONS, WE RIDE.
- ( shouting )

19:50.723 --> 19:54.725
YOUR LITTLE MONSTER
OF A SON AND HIS BAND
OF MISFITS TIED ME

19:54.727 --> 19:56.627
TO A CHAIR AND HUNG ME
FROM THE CEILING.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.132
SORRY, MOMMY,
I GOOFED UP.

20:03.469 --> 20:06.003
IF I DIDN'T CARRY A MULTI-TOOL
IN MY GARTERS,

20:06.005 --> 20:08.806
I NEVER WOULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT
OF THERE.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.542
PARKER--
WAIT, YOU WEAR GARTERS?

20:11.544 --> 20:13.711
JUST BECAUSE
I'M SUPERINTENDENT

20:13.713 --> 20:16.013
DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO
STOP BEING A LADY.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.784
SHE REVOKED MY PARDON, MOM.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.053
I'M GOING TO BE IN DETENTION
FOR THE PAGEANT.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.088
SHUCKY DARNS!

20:24.090 --> 20:26.857
WAIT A MINUTE.
SOMETHING'S UP.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.093
ARE YOU TRYING TO STAY
IN DETENTION

20:29.095 --> 20:30.428
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO
THE PAGEANT WITH ME?

20:30.430 --> 20:34.131
WHAT?
NO, I JUST BROKE BAD.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.501
GOT IN WITH THE WRONG
GROUP OF GUYS,

20:37.503 --> 20:38.970
STOPPED EATING VEGETABLES,

20:38.972 --> 20:42.106
QUIT FLOSSING BEFORE BED.

20:42.108 --> 20:45.443
I'M RIDDLED WITH GINGIVITIS.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.945
OKAY, OKAY, YOU ARE
DEFINITELY FAKING.

20:47.947 --> 20:51.148
HONEY, IF YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO DO THE PAGEANT WITH ME,

20:51.150 --> 20:52.950
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS
SAY SO.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.685
I DON'T WANT TO DO
THE PAGEANT.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.654
OH, YOU ARE DOING
THAT PAGEANT.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.726
WELCOME...

21:01.728 --> 21:04.795
TO THE "MAMA'S SWEET
BABY BOY PAGEANT."

21:04.797 --> 21:06.197
WE BRING YOU

21:06.199 --> 21:10.201
"BEYOND THE ARCTIC CIRCLE."

21:10.203 --> 21:12.970
( cheering )

21:12.972 --> 21:14.705
I AM THE NARWHAL,

21:14.707 --> 21:17.842
THE UNICORN OF THE SEA.

21:21.948 --> 21:25.216
HEY, MAMA'S SWEET BABY BOY,
YOU BETTER NAR-WORK IT.

21:27.053 --> 21:30.588
HEY, GUY, I'M ABOUT TO PUNCH.

21:30.590 --> 21:34.225
HOW ABOUT YOU KEEP IT DOWN
'CAUSE SOME OF US IS TRYING
TO ENJOY THE SHOW?

21:34.227 --> 21:36.961
YOU GO, GUMBALL MACHINE!
WHOO!

21:36.963 --> 21:38.763
<i>( dance music playing )</i>

22:08.061 --> 22:10.761
- MORNING, GUYS.
- HEY, GIRLS.  FEELING BETTER?

22:10.763 --> 22:14.632
YEAH, I AM RARING
TO GO FOR THAT EXAM
IN MRS. TIDWELL'S CLASS,

22:14.634 --> 22:17.001
AND THEN IT IS OFF
TO BUY A NEW PURSE.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.770
ONE WITH LESS CHUNKS IN IT.

22:19.772 --> 22:23.107
YEAH, I WAS SO SICK.

22:23.109 --> 22:27.211
BUT LUCKILY I WAS ABLE
TO SHUT MY BODY DOWN,
AND I SLEPT THE WHOLE TIME.

22:29.215 --> 22:31.148
DAD, THANKS FOR
TAKING CARE OF US.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.117
YEAH, NOT THAT I REALLY
THINK IT WAS THAT HARD,

22:33.119 --> 22:35.553
BUT WE REALLY
APPRECIATE IT.

22:37.557 --> 22:40.124
WELL, THEY MAY NOT
APPRECIATE IT, BUT I DO.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.893
THANK YOU, HONEY.
I OWE YOU ONE.

22:42.895 --> 22:46.163
GOOD, YOU CAN REPLACE
THE TOASTER THAT LIV RUINED.

22:48.067 --> 22:51.869
RUINED?  ARE YOU KIDDING?

22:51.871 --> 22:54.205
THIS IS THE BEST TOAST
I HAVE EVER HAD.

22:55.808 --> 22:59.143
- MMM, TASTES LIKE HOTDOGS.
- ( both gag )
