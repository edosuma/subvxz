- All right, you heard the captain.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.500
- Clear the compartment. Let's lock it.
- Lock it down up there!

00:21.500 --> 00:23.800
- Dog the hatches. Get the men... [Screams]
<i>- Captain?</i>

00:26.800 --> 00:28.800

Captain!

<i>Tactical swept her hangouts, and our locators</i>
<i>ran through their usual voodoo.</i>

00:51.000 --> 00:54.300
Each came back with the same result.
Eve has vanished.

00:54.300 --> 00:57.500
Well, I can't say
I'm particularly depressed by that news.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.800
She did leave
swearing vengeance.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.500
That doesn't usually
go well for us.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.900
Well, the senior partners
don't take betrayal lightly.

01:03.900 --> 01:06.900
Yeah, well, gotta figure they whisked her up
shortly after they nabbed the scheming prince.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.300
- Speaking of which...
- Uh, no news.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.200
But goin' off a company precedent,
right about now...

01:11.200 --> 01:13.000
Lindsey should be boiling
in his own filth.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
"Should be" is not gonna cut it.
Let's find out for sure.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.600
Well, the White Room's empty.
Our liaison to the senior partners has vanished.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.600
It's hard gettin'
information anymore.

01:19.600 --> 01:24.300
<i>We may be able to establish a new liaison</i>
<i>through a-a... through a protocol...</i>

01:24.300 --> 01:26.600
Uh, sorry.
Must be tired.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.700
Um, we've got options.
I'll get on it.

01:28.700 --> 01:31.000
It can wait till morning.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.500
Eve's vanished.
Let's end on a high note.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.700
Whoa. Calling the patient
before midnight on a Friday?

01:36.700 --> 01:39.000
Careful, gang.
We might get to have social lives.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.600
Speak for yourself. I've got
five or six hours of spell detailing to do.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.600
And I got a mess of briefings
to go through.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.000
And I have to redo
the entire Trask experiment.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.900
Knox really dropped the ball
on that one.

01:48.900 --> 01:52.400
- Yes, he is unreliable. Good point.
- So much for social lives.

01:52.400 --> 01:57.200
<i>Well, should we at least meet back here in a</i>
<i>few hours and talk about some work some more?</i>

01:57.200 --> 01:58.800
Sounds lovely.

02:02.900 --> 02:06.200
[Fred] What did we do with our lives
before we got these jobs?

02:06.200 --> 02:08.400
I seem to recall
lots and lots ofJenga.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.300
Well, I'm outta here.
If we're working...

02:10.300 --> 02:12.700
there's a client party down at Skybar
with my name all over it.

02:12.700 --> 02:15.700
- That counts as work?
- You been to Skybar lately?

02:15.700 --> 02:18.000
It's all frat boys
and television executives.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.900
- Hey, if you're detailin' spells...
<i>- [Elevator Bell Dings]</i>

02:19.900 --> 02:22.900
Maybe we should go over
the portal incantations from
last Monday's Mithroc retreat.

02:22.900 --> 02:25.500
Oh, God, Gunn.
Don't even start.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.600

some of your equations here.

<i>I used to have</i>
<i>a bit of a head for numbers.</i>

03:57.400 --> 04:00.300

your mind when you stop using it.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.400
Is there something
I can help you with?

04:04.400 --> 04:08.400
Oh, don't be alarmed, Miss Burkle.
I just came to talk.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.800
- How do you know my name?
- Do you like workin' here?

04:11.800 --> 04:14.800
- What?
- You know. Do you enjoy what you do?

Uh, I don't know.

L-I mean, I guess
I had my doubts at first.

04:27.900 --> 04:31.300
- But lately, I've been feeling...
- Please don't try and run, Miss Burkle.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.500
I'd have to stop you.

04:37.100 --> 04:40.500
- What do you want?
- Actually, I came to see your boss.

04:42.100 --> 04:45.900
<i>Angel and I</i>

04:47.300 --> 04:49.500
I was friends with him

- No.
- Well, it's a shame.

05:38.900 --> 05:41.300
Times like these, we can use...

05:41.300 --> 05:43.300

German prototype submarine.

- How you holdin' up, Hodge?
- [Nervous Chuckle] Tiptop, sir.

We gotta keep it steady, sailor. If we're
gonna get out of this, we need you sharp.

08:32.299 --> 08:34.200
We gotta figure out
our next move.

08:34.200 --> 08:37.600
We got no means of controlling
the ship from up here.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.600

we got maybe two days of air left.

how to get through that hatch.

Sir.

12:01.700 --> 12:03.600
I have seen what those things

13:21.200 --> 13:24.300
One minute I'm askin' a fella

13:24.300 --> 13:28.700
Next minute, I'm stuck in a box

13:31.000 --> 13:33.300
Though I can't say I'm surprised.
From our company...

What about back there?
You save us anything?

14:32.500 --> 14:35.800
- Couple men left in the torpedo room.
- Well, what are we waiting for?

14:35.800 --> 14:37.000
- No.
- What?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.200
We're not killing any more humans.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.200
- Well, not right now.
- Why the hell not?

14:41.200 --> 14:45.000
'Cause in case you haven't noticed, Spike,
we're trapped at the bottom of the ocean.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.400
- Yeah? So?
- We're underwater?

14:50.300 --> 14:54.000
So unless you know how to operate one of
these things, we're gonna need their help.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.700
Oh, come on.
How hard can it be?

14:56.700 --> 14:59.400
Forward, back, up, down...

14:59.400 --> 15:03.000
<i>- [Alarm Blaring]</i>
- [Hissing]

15:03.000 --> 15:05.500
<i>[Alarm Stops]</i>

15:05.500 --> 15:08.000
Tell you what.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.500
<i>We'll leave one alive</i>
<i>to work the boat...</i>

15:11.500 --> 15:14.300
and eat the rest.

15:14.300 --> 15:17.400
- No.
- Uh, yeah. Probably should warn you.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.900
He likes to pretend he's the boss.

15:19.900 --> 15:23.500
You may have made a name for yourself
muscling around weaker vampires...

15:23.500 --> 15:25.700
- Hang on.
- But I'm Nostroyev.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.400
I will tear you open and play...

15:29.400 --> 15:34.000
"Coachman, Spare Your Horses"
on the lute of your entrails.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Get out of my way.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.000
[Screaming]

15:45.000 --> 15:50.200
We don't kill the humans till
we reach land. Is that clear?

15:52.400 --> 15:54.200
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

15:58.700 --> 16:01.300
<i>Hiya, Chief.</i>

16:01.300 --> 16:05.300
Oh, come on.
Don't tell me you don't recognize me.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.700
Spend time in a tube, you should know
your crew like the back of your hand.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.500
Lawson.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.900
You see there?
I'm touched.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.800
Aren't you gonna ask me
how I got in here?

16:17.800 --> 16:20.700
No. You'd be amazed at how many people
break into this building...

16:20.700 --> 16:23.400
- on a regular basis.
- But I had a whole bit planned...

16:23.400 --> 16:27.200
about how I was always good with technology,
and you, of all people, should know that.

16:27.500 --> 16:30.100
Yeah, sorry.

16:30.100 --> 16:32.000
This place might as well be
a bus station.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.200
Seems like you're doing
pretty well for yourself.

16:37.200 --> 16:41.700
It's a far cry from all those years
you spent in the gutters eating rats.

16:41.700 --> 16:45.700
You've been following my life.
I'm touched.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.500
I just check in
every decade or so.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.700
Imagine my surprise when
I found out that...

16:50.700 --> 16:54.400
Mr. Vermin Eater himself
was suddenly fighting evil...

16:54.400 --> 16:57.900
<i>and running Wolfram and Hart.</i>

16:57.900 --> 17:00.700
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i>Mind explaining that one to me?</i>

17:00.700 --> 17:02.800
Those two don't exactly
go hand in hand.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.800
It's complicated.

17:06.300 --> 17:09.200
I find that's true
about most things these days.

17:09.200 --> 17:13.200
I don't mean to sound
like an old man, but...

17:13.400 --> 17:15.200
we used to live in
simpler times, didn't we?

17:15.200 --> 17:18.500
Never thought I'd miss
bein' on that sub.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.900
Things made a kind of sense.

17:23.099 --> 17:26.900
Keep your head down,
watch each other's backs...

17:26.900 --> 17:29.800
And stay alert.
Follow our lead.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.000
We'll get out of this.
All right?

17:41.800 --> 17:45.000
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>Lawson, this is Spike, the Prince of Lies.</i>

17:45.000 --> 17:48.300
Put 'em to work if you need 'em.

17:50.700 --> 17:53.900
Spinelli, take Heinrich up to the galley.
Then do a full systems check.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.800
You got five minutes.
Start with the batteries.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.400
I want juice as soon as possible.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.000
O'Shea, you're at the helm.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.200
<i>Tyler, you're gonna have</i>
<i>to handle bow and stern for now.</i>

18:04.200 --> 18:07.100
If we have to surface, we can't outmaneuver
theJerries on batteries alone.

18:07.100 --> 18:09.000
I'll work on the engines
once we're underway.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.900
- But right now, I just wanna get moving.
- And where does the captain sit?

18:11.900 --> 18:13.700
Uh, right there.

18:13.700 --> 18:17.600
Oh. Right.
And now, uh...

18:17.600 --> 18:19.700
who brings the captain his drink?

18:19.700 --> 18:23.100
Hodge, you're on communications.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.100
<i>Hodge.!</i>

18:28.000 --> 18:30.700
What should I do?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.800
Sit down over here, Prince of Lies.

18:36.900 --> 18:40.900
This bathysphere is perplexing.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.700
Let's get these bodies out of here.

19:05.700 --> 19:08.000
May I speak freely, sir?

19:11.400 --> 19:15.900
I recognize there's a lot goin' on here
that I don't understand.

19:15.900 --> 19:18.000
But those monsters butchered my crew.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.200
Apparently, they're in the S.S.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.900
Spike's not in the S.S.
He just likes wearin' the jacket.

19:22.900 --> 19:26.300
Yeah, that doesn't help me understand
why we're workin' with 'em.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.200
Or keepin' 'em alive,
for that matter.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.900
- I got 'em under control.
- That's not the point.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.800
- He killed my captain, sir.
- We may be able to use them.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.000
- We don't have much of a crew left.
<i>- I don't think we'll need 'em.</i>

19:38.000 --> 19:40.500
- They're extra hands.
- They're monsters.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.000
- And I don't know why we...
- You don't need to know why.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.800
We gotta bring this sub in.
Those are our orders.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.800
<i>Isn't that the point?</i>
<i>Following orders?</i>

19:55.700 --> 20:01.000
There's a difference between
orders and purpose, sir.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.300
Now, I didn't sign on
'cause I needed directions.

20:04.300 --> 20:07.000
<i>Hell, growin'up,</i>
<i>I used to make fun of the military boys.</i>

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Always figured they wouldn't know
how to tie their shoes...

20:09.000 --> 20:12.300
if someone didn't
give 'em the go-ahead.

20:12.300 --> 20:16.200
Then I saw pictures of
what the Krauts were doin'.

20:16.200 --> 20:19.700
Evil's spreadin', sir.
And it's not just over there.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.900
It was on my ship.
It killed my crew, and we gotta stop it.

20:22.900 --> 20:26.600
Now, I've been scared out of my mind
since I signed on for this duty.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.300
But I can keep it together.
I can even handle dying...

20:29.300 --> 20:31.200
if I know it's for a greater purpose.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.400
We got a job to do.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.700
That job is gonna
help us win the war.

20:36.700 --> 20:41.800
I don't need you
to understand every detail.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.400
Just know we're fightin'
on the same side.

20:46.900 --> 20:50.900
I need you to trust that
I'm gonna get us all through this...

20:51.000 --> 20:52.800
safe and sound.

20:57.500 --> 21:00.100
"Safe and sound."

21:02.100 --> 21:04.900
Guess now's not the time
to argue semantics, is it?

21:06.400 --> 21:08.800
Did you care about any of it?

21:08.800 --> 21:11.000
The ship?

21:11.000 --> 21:14.200
The mission?
The men?

21:14.200 --> 21:18.000
- Or were you just in it to save your own ass?
- What do you want, Lawson?

21:18.300 --> 21:20.900
Same thing I've always wanted...

21:20.900 --> 21:22.800
to understand.

21:22.800 --> 21:27.400
Understand what, exactly?

21:27.400 --> 21:29.600
Why we do what we do.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.400
<i>How you manage to always...</i>

21:34.600 --> 21:36.800
You sure you wanna do that, Chief?

21:36.800 --> 21:39.600
Fairly certain I said I'd kill you
if I ever saw you again.

21:39.600 --> 21:43.200
Oh, I never doubted you.
But you gotta ask yourself:

21:43.200 --> 21:48.300
Would I really come in here unarmed,
knowing that, without an ace in the hole?

21:48.300 --> 21:51.300
Wouldn't make much sense, would it?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.200
What did you do?

21:57.200 --> 21:59.000
[Elevator Bell Dings]

22:01.200 --> 22:06.300
<i>Now, I don't need you</i>
<i>to understand every detail...</i>

22:06.300 --> 22:11.800
but I do need you to trust that I'm gonna
get us all through this safe and sound.

22:20.800 --> 22:24.700
<i>Easy, now. That's double-aught wire</i>
<i>wrapped around your crew's necks.</i>

22:24.700 --> 22:27.600
<i>Take a fellow's head clean off</i>
<i>with just a little tug.</i>

22:27.600 --> 22:31.000
<i>Best not go roughhousing.</i>
<i>Something might get knocked over.</i>

22:33.800 --> 22:37.700
Whatever you want from me,
this isn't the way to get it.

22:37.700 --> 22:40.000
[Chuckles]
Already gettin' it.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.100
<i>The worry in your eyes...</i>

22:42.100 --> 22:44.800
fear of what might happen next.

22:44.800 --> 22:48.700
Which is right on the mark,
'cause I got a funny feeling...

22:48.700 --> 22:51.700
there is gonna be some blood
spilled tonight.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.100
For old time's sake.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.100
Is that any better?

23:11.100 --> 23:13.400
Little bit.
Stern plates are still dragging.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.400
Well, let's hope we don't have
to control down in a hurry.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.200
- You need any help with the bow plane?
- Chris has got it.

23:20.500 --> 23:24.200
[Chuckles] Well, keep an eye on him,
all right, just in case.

23:26.700 --> 23:29.400
Any signs of life?

23:29.400 --> 23:33.800
Nothin', huh?
I suppose the quieter, the better.

23:33.800 --> 23:37.100
Come on.
When am I gonna get a turn?

23:37.100 --> 23:39.100
In about never.

23:39.100 --> 23:43.000
I'm playin' nice with the anchovies,
like you asked.

23:43.300 --> 23:46.300
- At least let me have a go at the wheel.
<i>- Pipe down.</i>

23:46.300 --> 23:49.200
- I'm tryin' to work.
- Oh, "pipe down."

23:49.200 --> 23:53.000
That official sailor talk, is it?
Well, ahoy, matey. You can just swab my deck.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.100
- Spike...
- Captain.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.300
- What?
- I wanna be called "Captain."

23:56.300 --> 24:01.300
<i>I mean, hell,</i>
<i>I did eat him.</i>

24:01.300 --> 24:06.900
Check the torpedoes before I stuff you in a tube
and send you for a swim, <i>Captain.</i>

24:16.300 --> 24:19.300
- We gonna have a situation, sir?
- He'll do what I tell him.

24:19.300 --> 24:23.300
- 'Cause you know each other.
From before this, right?
- Somethin' on your mind, son?

24:26.000 --> 24:28.800
I just wanna make sure this boat
gets to where it's goin'.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.200
That and my crew
are all that matters.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.500
How they holding up?

24:36.500 --> 24:39.600
They knew capturing a Jerry sub
could be a one-way ticket.

24:39.600 --> 24:43.300
But they're good men. They'll keep it
together and they'll follow orders...

24:43.300 --> 24:45.200
or they'll have me to answer to.

24:45.200 --> 24:49.100
Good. Everybody keeps their cool,
we might just make it out of this.

24:49.300 --> 24:52.200
<i>- [Man Screaming]</i>

You think I don't know?

24:57.200 --> 25:00.700
I am as ancient
as the darkness itself.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.800
Yeah, you're real old.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.900
We know.
Just calm down.

<i>[Prince Of Lies] They dare conceive</i>
<i>such violations upon my temple.</i>

Put a sock in it.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.500

<i>Back to your stations.</i>
<i>Now.!</i>

How does a guy
just explode like that?

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
The man's askin' a good question.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.500
- You really need an answer?
- Might help if I heard it for sure.

25:57.500 --> 26:01.300
- Vampire.
- Yeah, I take it back. Doesn't help.

26:03.100 --> 26:05.000
So what do you think
set him off?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.700
<i>I'm guessin'these</i>
<i>had something to do with it.</i>

<i>Right.</i>
<i>Let's have it.</i>

26:18.000 --> 26:21.100
Don't have time for this, Spike.

- He says you're an idiot.

You speak German?

26:37.800 --> 26:40.100
- Enough to get by.

<i>Somethin'about</i>
<i>stimulation and control.</i>

- What mission?

27:58.200 --> 28:00.600
Oh, I get it.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.900
You're playin' both sides
against each other.

28:02.900 --> 28:05.000
- Spike...
- No, I respect that.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
But if the Yanks are after this stuff, too,
I'm eatin' the lot of'em.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.400
<i>- No, you aren't.</i>
- Try and stop me.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.600
Spike, we need them, okay? I'm not
gettin' trapped at the bottom of the sea.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.700
And I'm not gettin' experimented on
by his government.

28:15.700 --> 28:17.800
We wouldn't do that.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.900
You don't win a war
by doin' whatever it takes.

28:19.900 --> 28:22.600
You win by doin' what's right.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.300
- Yeah? Let me know how
that works out for you, Popeye.
<i>- None of this matters.</i>

28:25.300 --> 28:28.600
Your people are gettin' this ship
and their men on board that are still alive.

28:28.600 --> 28:31.300
That's all.

28:31.300 --> 28:33.600
Spike, torch it.

28:33.600 --> 28:37.100
- Damn skippy.
- [German]

28:37.100 --> 28:38.800
[Chuckling]

28:40.400 --> 28:42.900
<i>God save the king</i>

28:42.900 --> 28:46.400
<i>Send him victorious</i>

28:46.400 --> 28:49.600
- Happy and glorious
<i>- [Thud]</i>

28:49.600 --> 28:51.500
What was that?

28:51.500 --> 28:53.900
Ow!
Bloody hell!

28:55.800 --> 28:58.900
<i>- [Explosion]</i>
- Bloody hell!

28:58.900 --> 29:01.500
<i>- [Explosions Continue]</i>
<i>- [Lawson] Depth charges.</i>

29:01.500 --> 29:03.900
- Talk to me, Hodge.
- Contact maneuvering, sir.

29:03.900 --> 29:06.200
<i>- Multiple cavitations.</i>
- How many?

29:06.200 --> 29:10.000
<i>- Hodge?</i>
- I'm pickin' up at least three... four destroyers.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.800
<i>Four? We couldn't take on one</i>
<i>in this condition.</i>

29:12.800 --> 29:14.400
Splashes!

29:14.400 --> 29:17.600
- Sixty meters, fast dive!
- Sixty meters, fast dive! Aye, sir!

29:17.600 --> 29:19.700
- Spinelli, bow plane.
- Bow plane! Aye, sir!

29:19.700 --> 29:22.900
<i>- Hold steady. Six degree down bubble.</i>
- Six degrees, mark.

29:22.900 --> 29:25.600
- What can I do?
- Hang on.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.500
<i>[Sonar Pinging]</i>

29:45.800 --> 29:48.100
Krauts are shootin' blanks.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.700
<i>[Explosion]</i>

29:52.700 --> 29:55.500
- Hang on, men!
- [Shouting, Indistinct]

30:00.400 --> 30:03.800
- Report!
- Propulsion motor's down!
We're dead in the water!

30:03.800 --> 30:06.300
- Go. Get it back up.
- I d...

30:06.300 --> 30:09.500
- I'm not sure if I can.
- Get sure fast!

30:11.400 --> 30:13.200
<i>[Explosion]</i>

30:16.000 --> 30:18.300
We're taking on water!

30:18.300 --> 30:21.100
Somebody secure
the other compartment, now!

30:21.100 --> 30:23.900
- We're on it!
- What..."We"? What do you mean, "we"?

30:29.900 --> 30:32.000
<i>[Explosion]</i>

30:45.000 --> 30:47.100
It's no good.
The damn thing's stripped.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.100
Never... liked...
the ocean.

30:57.100 --> 30:59.600
Hey, where's Fritz?

31:00.800 --> 31:03.200
Come on, Sally.
Give it up.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.600
Screwdriver.

31:12.700 --> 31:15.100
Where the hell's
the screwdriver?

31:40.900 --> 31:42.800
<i>[Lawson]</i>
<i>Funny what goes through a man's mind...</i>

31:42.800 --> 31:46.400
<i>when his life's</i>
<i>hangin'in the balance.</i>

31:46.400 --> 31:50.200
Boys talked about that a lot
back on the boat.

31:50.200 --> 31:53.600
Always figured it'd be
the special moments you freeze in time.

31:53.600 --> 31:55.600
Your mom singin' you
to sleep at night.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.500
<i>Sneakin'into the movies</i>
<i>with your best friend.</i>

32:00.300 --> 32:02.300
<i>The way your girl's hair</i>
<i>shimmers in the sun.</i>

32:02.300 --> 32:04.400
<i>But the truth is...</i>

32:04.400 --> 32:07.200
the only thing that really
goes through your head is...

32:07.200 --> 32:11.600
"Wow. This really sucks."

32:11.600 --> 32:13.400
And then you're gone.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.900
- Lawson!
- I'm all right.

32:16.900 --> 32:18.500
- Easy, easy.
- I'm all right.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.300
Try not to move.

32:20.300 --> 32:23.600
We're dead
without propulsion.

32:23.600 --> 32:27.900
- Tell me what to do.
- I'm the only one.

32:27.900 --> 32:30.900
I'm the only one.
[Coughing]

32:30.900 --> 32:33.600
I'm not gonna let
any more die.

32:36.500 --> 32:38.200
I can fix it.

32:39.900 --> 32:41.900
I can fix it.
[Coughs]

32:41.900 --> 32:44.100
I know you can.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.800
Air's about gone.

33:19.800 --> 33:23.500
Your new boy better get the engines
runnin' before the fish start floppin'.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.600
He'll get it done.

33:27.600 --> 33:30.500
Hope it's in time.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.700
<i>The one on the end</i>
<i>looks like he's done for.</i>

33:34.900 --> 33:37.900
Be a blessing to put him
out of his misery.

33:37.900 --> 33:41.300
<i>[Engines Powering Up]</i>

33:41.300 --> 33:44.800
Get 'em on their feet.
We need to surface.

33:44.800 --> 33:47.600
Your lucky day, isn't it?

33:54.100 --> 33:58.500
- You did it.
- I told you I could.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.200
Good work.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.600
Thanks, Chief.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.600
You too.

34:09.900 --> 34:12.600
- We're surfacing.
- Yeah.

34:12.600 --> 34:16.300
Is that a sharp maneuver with
Jerry still trollin' for us?

34:16.300 --> 34:20.100
We're out of air. Crew's not gonna
make it if we don't vent.

34:22.400 --> 34:26.199
They swore to give their lives
for their country, just like me.

34:26.199 --> 34:29.500
- Besides, I'm hungry.
- They're still your men.

34:29.500 --> 34:33.300
But they're not the mission.
Are they?

34:37.199 --> 34:41.000
You're new at this.
I'm not. Let's take a walk.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.400
They look smaller.

35:05.600 --> 35:09.400
Eight hours to sunrise.
Twenty miles from land.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.700
I just might make it.

35:12.700 --> 35:16.500
Hey. I'm sorry
for what happened.

35:16.800 --> 35:22.000
But if I ever see you again,
I'm gonna have to kill you.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.900
Aye, aye, Chief.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.700
Take good care of her.

35:28.700 --> 35:30.500
She's a good boat.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.400
Bloody brilliant.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.300
Turn the poor sod
to save the ship...

35:44.300 --> 35:48.900
then make him dash for dry land before
Mr. Sunshine scorches him a new one.

35:48.900 --> 35:51.500
You're still a dick.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.800
Yeah. I am.

36:03.300 --> 36:05.100
Bollocks.

36:10.900 --> 36:14.400
<i>Did they at least torture you?</i>
<i>Please tell me they did.</i>

36:14.400 --> 36:17.200
Never gave them a chance.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.400
<i>Jumped ship</i>
<i>off the coast of Maine.</i>

36:19.400 --> 36:22.900
Went underground till
the war was over.

36:22.900 --> 36:26.100
- Like any other coward.
- Wars are won and lost by men.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.000
You mean, like me?

36:28.000 --> 36:30.300
No, wait.
That doesn't apply anymore, does it?

36:30.300 --> 36:33.600
- I never wanted to do this to you.
- Oh, put your hanky away.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.300
<i>I know how important the technology</i>
<i>they pulled from the sub was...</i>

36:36.300 --> 36:38.600
<i>to helpin'us stop the Germans.</i>

36:38.600 --> 36:40.500
Sounded like a fair shake.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.600
One person damned to make the world
safe for future generations.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.900
Except these guys.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.300
Killing them's not gonna
change the past.

36:51.200 --> 36:54.700
But it'll hurt you.
Maybe that's enough.

36:54.700 --> 36:56.800
Never is.

36:56.800 --> 37:00.100
Then maybe I found my mission
again after all these years.

37:00.100 --> 37:02.500
Being an evil son of a bitch
not keeping you busy?

37:02.500 --> 37:07.000
We all need a reason to live,
even if we're already dead.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.500
Mom, apple pie, stars and stripes...

37:09.500 --> 37:12.500
<i>That was good enough for me</i>
<i>till I met you.</i>

37:12.500 --> 37:15.300
Then I had this whole "creature of the night"
thing goin' for me...

37:15.300 --> 37:18.900
the joy of destruction and death...
and I embraced it.

37:18.900 --> 37:21.000
I did all the terrible things
a monster does.

37:21.000 --> 37:26.300
<i>Murdered women and children, tortured</i>
<i>fathers and husbands just to hear 'em scream.</i>

37:26.300 --> 37:30.000
<i>And through it all, I felt nothing.</i>

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
Sixty years of blood
drying in my throat like ashes.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.300
So what do you think?
Is it me, Chief?

37:38.300 --> 37:40.200
Or does everyone you sired
feel this way?

37:40.200 --> 37:45.400
You're the only one
I ever did this to... after I got a soul.

37:45.400 --> 37:47.800
Do I have one too?

37:52.000 --> 37:54.600
I don't think
it works that way, son.

37:56.700 --> 37:58.500
Didn't think so.

38:12.300 --> 38:14.800
<i>You gave mejust enough,</i>
<i>didn't you?</i>

38:14.800 --> 38:19.100
Enough of your soul to keep me trapped
between who I was and who I should be.

38:20.300 --> 38:24.200
I'm nothin' because of you.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.400
You really want it
to end like this?

38:42.400 --> 38:44.200
Sounds like a plan.

38:54.900 --> 38:58.100
Come on, Chief.
Give me a mission.

39:18.100 --> 39:22.600
Really oughta do somethin'
about security.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.200
[Chuckles]
They'll let anybody in here, won't they?

39:30.400 --> 39:34.000
Fred gave me the Cliff Notes.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.600
So sailor boy finally
came back for a yo-ho-ho, did he?

39:37.600 --> 39:39.500
Finally came back.

39:39.500 --> 39:42.700
Took him long enough.

39:42.700 --> 39:46.100
I know revenge is best served cold and all,
but his must've been frozen solid.

39:47.400 --> 39:50.000
I don't think that's
what he was after.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.700
No? Then what
was he looking for?

39:55.700 --> 39:59.500
A reason.
