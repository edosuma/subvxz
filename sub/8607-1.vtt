[ Sighs ] You know, l made that bet
before l knew you, Laney.

01:28:16.696 --> 01:28:18.615
Before l really knew me.

01:28:21.453 --> 01:28:25.041
What was it for anyway ?
l mean, what did you end up losing ?

Before her,

01:28:36.976 --> 01:28:39.939
l thought we had to have
all the answers right now.

01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:43.444
And now ?

01:28:43.486 --> 01:28:47.408

l feel just like Julia Roberts
in Pretty Woman.

01:29:43.242 --> 01:29:45.245
You know, except for
the whole hooker thing.

01:29:49.919 --> 01:29:51.963

01:29:53.841 --> 01:29:57.221

about art school myself.

- Art ? You don't take art.
- Yeah.

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:08.154
Yeah, but l'm thinkin' more
along the lines of performance art.

01:30:08.238 --> 01:30:10.992

- Zack.

01:30:11.117 --> 01:30:14.831

01:30:31.606 --> 01:30:33.985

- Yeah.

01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:39.994
