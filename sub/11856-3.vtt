WEBVTT

00:37.792 --> 00:40.083
(woman on screen)
'Oh...no.'

00:41.083 --> 00:42.333
No, no.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.542
(woman on screen)
'Oh!'

00:49.041 --> 00:51.250
'No! No!'

00:56.542 --> 00:57.917
(Angus)
'I'm a major loser.'

00:58.000 --> 01:00.208
Screamed like a girl
about five times.

01:00.291 --> 01:02.250
More like ten.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.166
But I totally dug
the dirty stuff.

01:04.250 --> 01:06.458
Does that help
my manhood?

01:06.542 --> 01:10.125
Oh, no. It just
makes you a perv.

01:10.208 --> 01:11.625
Hey guys, wait up.

01:11.709 --> 01:14.208
It's not cool to
ditch
the wheelchair
girl.

01:16.041 --> 01:18.291
Oh my God, Vick,
I'm so sorry.

01:18.375 --> 01:21.000
In case you haven't noticed
this
thing doesn't have turbo.

01:21.083 --> 01:23.041
We were
gonna
wait.

01:23.125 --> 01:26.709
So, anybody wanna go
grab a beer or something?

01:26.792 --> 01:28.208
I can't. I gotta
work tomorrow.

01:28.291 --> 01:29.875
Craig, don't be a jerk.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.834
Does having a
job
make me a jerk?

01:31.917 --> 01:33.709
Vicky!

01:33.792 --> 01:36.834
Pop, you didn't
have to pick me up.

01:36.917 --> 01:38.542
Well, here I am, anyway.

01:38.625 --> 01:41.000
How are you, sir?
It's good to see
you.

01:41.083 --> 01:42.500
I'm sorry to
break
up the party.

01:42.583 --> 01:44.458
I just wanna get
my girl home safe.

01:44.542 --> 01:47.333
Well, I guess I'll
catch ya later, guys.

01:47.417 --> 01:49.041
Love ya, Vick.

01:52.291 --> 01:54.875
(Vicky)
Hey, thanks for coming.

01:54.959 --> 01:56.166
Thanks for asking.

01:58.250 --> 02:01.291
It was really great
to see everybody.

02:10.542 --> 02:13.375
The only reason I came is
'cause Vicky asked me to.

02:13.458 --> 02:17.250
It's never gonna be the
way
it was, you understand?

02:17.333 --> 02:18.792
Let's get outta here.

03:21.875 --> 03:23.458
(Nick)
'If I start
a regular poker game'

03:23.542 --> 03:25.417
you interested?

03:25.500 --> 03:26.917
Maybe, yeah.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.458
Geez, don't do me any favors.

03:30.709 --> 03:32.500
Something wrong with
the way I play cards?

03:32.583 --> 03:35.333
You get a lil' heated up, is
all
when things don't go your way.

03:35.417 --> 03:37.583
Yeah? Forget the whole thing.

03:37.667 --> 03:39.542
(Scotty)
Hey, Jo, you play cards?

03:39.625 --> 03:41.458
Sure. I'm a Texas Hold 'Em girl.

03:41.542 --> 03:43.333
There you go.

03:46.083 --> 03:49.083
[chuckles]
It's for the best,
trust me.

03:51.333 --> 03:52.583
Who's Lil talking to?

03:52.667 --> 03:54.417
A woman whose son was
killed back in '78.

03:54.500 --> 03:58.583
Supposedly a copycat murder
of the movie "Halloween."

03:58.667 --> 04:01.125
I'm moving, and..

04:01.208 --> 04:04.667
...I found this when I
was boxing up Angus' things.

04:04.750 --> 04:05.875
What is it?

04:05.959 --> 04:08.125
It's a letter to Angus
from his friend, Vicky

04:08.208 --> 04:11.041
written the day he died.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.166
"You say you
want to marry
me"

04:13.250 --> 04:15.083
"but you don't
know
what that means."

04:15.166 --> 04:18.667
Angus was over the moon for her,
but I never knew he'd proposed.

04:18.750 --> 04:21.667
But she's
asking
for more time.

04:21.750 --> 04:24.291
"And don't tell anybody.
It's too dangerous for you."

04:24.375 --> 04:27.834
Angus and Vicky were
in a terrible accident...

04:27.917 --> 04:29.250
six months before he died.

04:29.333 --> 04:33.291
- What happened?
- Angus was driving too fast.

04:33.375 --> 04:36.291
He was lucky, but Vicky..

04:36.375 --> 04:38.125
...she was paralyzed.

04:38.208 --> 04:39.959
And people blamed Angus.

04:40.041 --> 04:42.333
You think he was killed
because someone found out

04:42.417 --> 04:43.500
about this proposal?

04:43.583 --> 04:45.250
Yes, I do.

04:45.333 --> 04:46.667
The man they arrested
back then

04:46.750 --> 04:48.834
it just never felt
right to me.

04:50.834 --> 04:53.917
Afraid that's not
much
to go on, Mrs.
Bistrong.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.709
You would have liked
Angus, detective.

04:55.792 --> 04:57.041
He would have made you smile.

04:57.125 --> 04:59.291
I'm sure you're right.

04:59.375 --> 05:00.625
I'm moving from the house

05:00.709 --> 05:02.959
where I raised that
little boy on my own.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.792
All I want is
to leave his spirit

05:04.875 --> 05:07.417
with some kind of peace.

05:07.500 --> 05:11.166
It's where good karma
comes from, you know.

05:11.250 --> 05:12.500
Acts of kindness.

05:13.750 --> 05:17.250
Uh, I don't really go in
for that kind of thing.

05:18.792 --> 05:21.875
Do you go in
for finding the truth?

06:01.041 --> 06:03.709
(Lilly)
All signs pointed to Eddie
Foster, the nut job

06:03.792 --> 06:05.750
who dressed like
<i>Halloween.</i>

06:05.834 --> 06:09.166
Stabbed a girl in Gray's
Ferry the night before.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.959
I remember the press
loved this story.

06:11.041 --> 06:13.083
Yeah, Angus was found
in the same area

06:13.166 --> 06:15.917
as the first victim,
less than 24 hours later.

06:16.041 --> 06:20.083
Fibers from Foster's trunk
matched ones found on the
girl.

06:20.166 --> 06:22.291
No fibers were recovered
on Angus.

06:22.375 --> 06:24.542
- That's something.
- Not much.

06:24.625 --> 06:27.000
Come on.
I got karma on the line here.

06:27.083 --> 06:29.792
[chuckles]
Foster's not gonna
be very helpful.

06:29.875 --> 06:32.125
He killed himself
a week before his trial.

06:32.208 --> 06:35.041
Autopsy says Angus' body
was moved postmortem

06:35.125 --> 06:36.917
to the movie theater.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.333
Alright, we'll run
his clothes again

06:38.417 --> 06:39.959
see if the new scan
picks up trace fibers.

06:40.041 --> 06:41.625
(Lilly)
'Well, they talked
to the friends'

06:41.709 --> 06:44.250
Angus was with that night,
trying to retrace his steps.

06:44.333 --> 06:45.625
Well, the car
accident's probably

06:45.709 --> 06:46.834
the reason he was killed.

06:46.917 --> 06:48.250
But that was six months
before he died.

06:48.333 --> 06:50.417
Believe me,
it's motive enough.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.542
Well, for now, let's focus
on the secret proposal.

06:53.625 --> 06:55.458
A tight group
of friends like that

06:55.542 --> 06:57.208
'hard to keep
anything secret.'

06:57.291 --> 07:00.000
Well, we'll follow the
grapevine, start at the
roots.

07:00.083 --> 07:02.166
Vicky, the girl
from the accident.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.125
Do you have
small children?

07:19.834 --> 07:21.458
Um, not of our own.
That wasn't in the
cards.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.166
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

07:24.250 --> 07:27.625
- The kids go nuts for her.
- Hmm. And I love the kids.

07:27.709 --> 07:31.208
The pain-in-the-ass
parents I can do without.

07:31.291 --> 07:33.291
But you wanted
to talk about Angus.

07:33.375 --> 07:35.333
Yeah, we're taking
another look at the case.

07:35.417 --> 07:36.875
After all this time?

07:36.959 --> 07:39.542
- Did something new come up?
- Well, looks like it, yeah.

07:39.625 --> 07:43.166
Vicky, we heard Angus proposed
to you right before he died.

07:43.250 --> 07:44.667
How did you know about that?

07:44.750 --> 07:47.208
Uh, his mom found your letter.

07:47.291 --> 07:49.834
There you seemed pretty
worried for Angus.

07:49.917 --> 07:52.709
Didn't want him telling anybody.

07:52.792 --> 07:54.792
Well, after the accident

07:54.875 --> 07:56.834
our friends couldn't forgive
him for what happened.

07:56.917 --> 08:00.375
They were...brutal.

08:00.458 --> 08:03.083
And who rode him the hardest?

08:03.166 --> 08:05.208
- Craig.
- Why?

08:05.291 --> 08:06.875
He was my boyfriend..

08:06.959 --> 08:08.625
...before the accident.

08:08.709 --> 08:10.291
Needed to blame somebody
for what happened.

08:10.375 --> 08:12.917
Oh, we heard Angus
was driving pretty fast.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.375
Yeah, and you've
never done that?

08:14.458 --> 08:17.000
Vick...they're just
trying to help.

08:17.083 --> 08:18.709
Yeah, I know. I know.

08:18.792 --> 08:21.750
[sighs]
It was an accident, detective.

08:22.959 --> 08:25.125
And Craig saw it all go down.

08:26.792 --> 08:28.667
We should rent a house
together this summer.

08:28.750 --> 08:31.417
We're done with school.
Get a totally decent place.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.583
Yeah. We could all
go in on a big color
TV

08:34.667 --> 08:36.083
get Atari.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.291
What are you, 12?

08:37.375 --> 08:38.917
[scoffs]
What are you, 40?

08:40.291 --> 08:41.750
(Craig)
I can dig living with chicks.

08:41.834 --> 08:43.417
Always someone around to
do the housework, right?

08:45.375 --> 08:47.917
You know, it's a little
cold for the bike.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.750
Can I go with you?

08:50.834 --> 08:52.250
Yeah. Sure.

08:52.333 --> 08:55.083
You're gonna pick Angus' beater
over this beautiful ride?

08:55.166 --> 08:57.375
Hey, ease up on
my wheels, man.

08:57.458 --> 08:59.834
(Donna)
I'm not
too cold.

08:59.917 --> 09:01.333
(Craig)
Alright.

09:10.667 --> 09:15.000
This is not a
beater.
<i>This is a</i>
<i>classic.</i>

09:15.083 --> 09:16.917
C'mon, let's blow
this taco stand.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.291
Show Craig what
a beater can do.

09:27.959 --> 09:29.291
You're awesome. You know that?

09:51.750 --> 09:55.041
- Later, dude.
- Angus!

10:09.083 --> 10:11.625
[Craig echoing]
Oh, my God.

10:11.709 --> 10:13.750
[fireman echoing]
Hang on. We'll get
you outta there.

10:13.834 --> 10:15.083
[fireman echoing]
It's jammed tight!

10:22.917 --> 10:24.083
You okay?

10:28.917 --> 10:32.542
I was looking
to get Craig riled up.

10:32.625 --> 10:34.166
Remind him
that I had..

10:34.250 --> 10:36.208
[smirks]
...option
s.

10:36.291 --> 10:37.750
So, the way you figure it

10:37.834 --> 10:41.375
the accident
was...part your fault.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.875
I was the one
who egged him on.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.375
If I hadn't..

10:46.458 --> 10:48.750
She, uh, found a
way
to forgive Angus

10:48.834 --> 10:52.542
but she's never
forgiven
herself.

10:52.625 --> 10:55.250
(Vicky)
Well, after that
everything changed.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.709
It was "Life, Part Two."

10:57.792 --> 11:00.458
Your friends ever
threaten Angus direct?

11:01.875 --> 11:04.250
Craig did...a few times.

11:04.333 --> 11:07.375
Told Angus to stay away
from me or he'd regret it.

11:07.458 --> 11:11.083
Any chance Craig found out,
somehow, about Angus proposing?

11:13.333 --> 11:17.542
Angus had this fantasy that
things would go back to
normal.

11:17.625 --> 11:20.333
That, huh, Craig
would be his best bud
again.

11:21.834 --> 11:27.000
He might have reached out to
Craig, asked for his support.

11:27.083 --> 11:29.583
It would have been
a really bad move.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.959
I respect the hell
out of the police.

11:44.041 --> 11:45.458
You guys do
stellar work.

11:45.542 --> 11:48.458
You know, laying your ass
on the line for us average
Joes.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.500
Laying the butter on
pretty thick there,
Craig.

11:50.583 --> 11:52.083
I'm just speaking the truth.

11:52.166 --> 11:54.125
Why don't we get back to Angus?

11:54.208 --> 11:56.000
We heard you were pretty
rough on your old pal.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.458
Hey, he brought it on himself.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.125
Bad enough what he did.

11:59.208 --> 12:01.125
But then he wouldn't
take
responsibility for it.

12:01.208 --> 12:03.500
Meaning he blamed someone else?

12:03.583 --> 12:06.500
Well, for a while it was
the car flipped too easy.

12:06.583 --> 12:08.417
You know, then
the
brakes were bad.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.792
[smirks]
Said he was gonna sue.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.625
But nothing ever
came
of it, of course.

12:12.709 --> 12:14.500
(Josie)
'You know Angus
popped the question to Vicky?'

12:14.583 --> 12:17.417
Day he was killed.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.625
- No. I didn't.
- Mm-hmm.

12:19.709 --> 12:23.291
Where'd you go that
night after the movie?

12:23.375 --> 12:26.333
Out with Donna. Got some
beers, crashed at her
place.

12:26.417 --> 12:29.333
Donna, who we hear
is in Europe somewhere.

12:29.417 --> 12:32.000
I had no idea
Angus proposed, okay?

12:32.083 --> 12:35.166
Thought you and Vicky
were an item.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.750
Okay, I know how this sounds.

12:37.834 --> 12:39.875
But after the
accident,
my feelings changed.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.792
- Changed how?
- 'I still cared about
her.'

12:42.875 --> 12:45.625
But she wasn't exactly
girlfriend material anymore.

12:45.709 --> 12:49.625
Wow. That kind of loyalty
must've really helped her

12:49.709 --> 12:50.792
through the hard times.

12:50.875 --> 12:52.083
Hey, give me a break, here.

12:52.166 --> 12:53.375
I was a kid.

12:53.458 --> 12:56.417
Besides, everything
had changed between us.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.625
All of us.

13:07.959 --> 13:10.458
I was just dropping something
off I got for her, okay?

13:10.542 --> 13:12.000
Just go, Angus.

13:14.208 --> 13:17.041
You got to forgive me
sometime, Craig.

13:18.083 --> 13:21.166
You're my best friend, man.

13:21.250 --> 13:24.166
I'm nothing to you anymore.

13:24.250 --> 13:25.667
Let's go in. See Vicky.

13:33.792 --> 13:35.709
Hey, Vick!

13:35.792 --> 13:37.959
(Donna)
'Couple of losers
here to see you.'

13:42.208 --> 13:44.000
Not feeling
so great today, guys.

13:44.083 --> 13:45.750
- 'I'm sorry.'
- That's cool.

13:45.834 --> 13:48.208
That's totally understandable.

13:48.291 --> 13:49.750
So, uh, we were
thinking we
could

13:49.834 --> 13:51.250
throw a major bash
when you get
better.

13:51.333 --> 13:52.792
We'll do it
at my parents' place.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.166
Get a band, have
a dance floor, make it
decent.

13:55.250 --> 13:57.041
We could, uh, do
my classic frozen margaritas.

13:57.125 --> 13:59.250
- Get everybody wasted.
- Guys.

13:59.333 --> 14:01.750
Obviously, she doesn't care
about some party right now.

14:01.834 --> 14:03.166
Let her rest.

14:03.250 --> 14:04.917
God, I was...we
were just trying to--

14:05.000 --> 14:06.583
She's just not in the mood
for that kind of stuff.

14:06.667 --> 14:08.166
- Stop hollering at her.
- Hey!

14:08.250 --> 14:09.709
I really respect
what you did and all.

14:09.792 --> 14:12.208
<i>okay?</i>

14:16.542 --> 14:18.166
We'll be back
later, Vick.

14:28.291 --> 14:30.208
So who was the guy
hanging around Vicky's room?

14:30.291 --> 14:33.291
The fireman. Pulled her out
of the car, saved her life.

14:33.375 --> 14:35.083
What was he doing there?

14:35.166 --> 14:36.291
He was always there.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.166
So he fell for her?

14:38.250 --> 14:41.041
I thought he was just basking
in the hero glow at first

14:41.125 --> 14:44.458
but...turned out, yeah,
he fell for her.

14:44.542 --> 14:45.667
Maybe he would've had
something to say

14:45.750 --> 14:47.625
if he found out
Angus proposed.

14:47.709 --> 14:49.959
[smirks]
I'd put money on it.

14:50.041 --> 14:51.542
So, whatever happened
to this guy?

14:52.959 --> 14:57.083
[gentle laugh]
Vicky married him,
that's what.

14:57.166 --> 14:59.166
That fireman is her husband.

15:05.166 --> 15:06.333
(Scotty)
'Women love firemen.'

15:06.417 --> 15:07.917
'It's like a disease
or something.'

15:08.000 --> 15:09.291
(Will)
'Yeah, give a lady
a choice between'

15:09.375 --> 15:12.333
a nice-looking detective
and a mutt fireman

15:12.417 --> 15:14.125
they'll go for
the dog every time.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.166
This fireman was a big hero.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.083
Pulled Vicky
from the burning car.

15:18.166 --> 15:19.750
And neither of them mentioned
it when you talked to her?

15:19.834 --> 15:21.166
Nope.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.834
The ex, Craig, said our
fireman
was a real possessive type.

15:23.917 --> 15:26.583
Might get pretty worked up
about
a proposal coming Vicky's way.

15:26.667 --> 15:29.542
If he knew about it.
The ex point at anyone else?

15:29.625 --> 15:32.583
Said Angus was looking into
maybe the car was faulty.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.667
Drives like a
maniac,
blames the car.

15:34.750 --> 15:37.041
The accident report said he
wasn't driving more than 45.

15:37.125 --> 15:38.792
- Just didn't--
- Limit there is 30.

15:38.875 --> 15:40.750
You know how many
pedestrians get mowed down

15:40.834 --> 15:42.709
by idiots speeding
down that road?

15:42.792 --> 15:45.834
Hey. I'm just saying
what's in the AID report.

15:45.917 --> 15:49.875
Lil, let's talk to Angus' mom,
see what he was looking into.

15:49.959 --> 15:52.166
And we'll find out why
we didn't get the full story

15:52.250 --> 15:53.500
on our hero fireman.

15:57.083 --> 16:00.375
- Wanna grab some coffee, Jo?
- Yeah, sure.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.458
So, I say
something
wrong up there?

16:07.542 --> 16:09.542
- Well..
- I got an attitude too
quick?

16:09.625 --> 16:11.125
- Sutton..
- 'Cause I'm working on that.

16:11.208 --> 16:12.417
Hey.

16:14.291 --> 16:16.417
I wanted you to know..

16:16.500 --> 16:20.208
...Will's wife was killed
about
ten years ago, a hit-and-run.

16:20.291 --> 16:24.333
Now, this case, the
accident
it seems it's on his mind.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.917
Aw, crap.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.208
And I was mouthing off.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.333
You didn't know.

16:29.417 --> 16:30.834
One black coffee.
What can I get you?

16:30.917 --> 16:33.834
Uh, coffee, regular.

16:33.917 --> 16:35.166
And a rookie dunce cap.

16:35.250 --> 16:37.542
Yeah, he's probably
sold out of those.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.750
Eh, you'll get to know
these guys, Jo.

16:43.834 --> 16:46.750
Yeah, no, I know.

16:46.834 --> 16:48.208
I'll meet you back there.

16:48.291 --> 16:50.125
Thanks, boss.

16:57.625 --> 17:00.834
(Mrs. Bistrong)
'All I have is green tea.
Is that all right?'

17:00.917 --> 17:02.417
That'll be fine.

17:04.834 --> 17:07.208
You think I get too heated
up when I play cards?

17:07.291 --> 17:08.917
Yeah.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.625
I'm so grateful to you
for looking into this case.

17:15.333 --> 17:17.917
Mrs. Bistrong, we heard
that Angus thought
something

17:18.000 --> 17:20.917
might've gone wrong
with
his car, causing it to
flip.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.792
He talked about
it
constantly at
first.

17:23.875 --> 17:26.333
I told him to stop
thinking like that.

17:26.417 --> 17:27.750
Good of you.

17:29.500 --> 17:33.750
A few days before he died,
I talked to him about it.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.750
And he surprised me.

17:35.834 --> 17:36.959
(Mrs. Bistrong)
'Angus?'

17:41.709 --> 17:45.417
I got the Drexel
course list for you.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.625
Maybe it's time to
finish up that last semester

17:47.709 --> 17:49.500
and get your degree.

17:49.583 --> 17:52.041
I have enough
in the savings account.

17:52.125 --> 17:54.125
Thanks, Mom, but I'm..

17:54.208 --> 17:56.583
...kind of swamped right now.

17:56.667 --> 17:59.083
Oh, Angus, please stop
torturing yourself.

17:59.166 --> 18:00.959
None of this
can change what happened.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.500
And if it wasn't all my fault

18:02.583 --> 18:03.792
people might not
hate me so much.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.166
Angus..

18:05.250 --> 18:06.333
And Vicky might
look at me
different.

18:06.417 --> 18:08.208
She's forgiven you.

18:10.625 --> 18:13.041
All I want is
that
one second back

18:13.125 --> 18:15.875
so I can hit the brakes
sooner
and move around the truck.

18:15.959 --> 18:20.834
Gussie...from the time
you were a tiny boy

18:20.917 --> 18:24.208
you have been the sweetest
spirit on this earth

18:24.291 --> 18:25.792
the most gentle.

18:25.875 --> 18:29.458
You didn't mean to hurt
anybody. It was an accident.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.333
Forgive yourself.

18:31.417 --> 18:33.709
Try to move forward.

18:34.834 --> 18:37.625
I am moving forward, mom.

18:41.166 --> 18:42.834
It'll be okay.

18:42.917 --> 18:44.208
You'll see.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.417
[chuckles]
Oh.

18:49.083 --> 18:53.542
I think he wanted to become
a fireman and save people.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.542
Like that fireman
who saved Vicky.

18:55.625 --> 18:57.583
He ever take the test?

18:57.667 --> 18:58.709
Never got to.

18:58.792 --> 19:01.375
He was killed a few days later.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.250
Do you still have
those manuals of his?

19:03.333 --> 19:06.667
I'm sure I do. I don't
throw anything of his
away.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.875
- I'll find them for you.
- 'Appreciate it.'

19:13.333 --> 19:15.417
Angus was a good boy, detective.

19:15.500 --> 19:19.041
Even if accepting what he'd
done
was too much for him to bear.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.500
A pretty big piece of
info.
you two left out, Ian.

19:34.041 --> 19:36.709
All due respect,
I never really knew Angus.

19:36.792 --> 19:38.375
Or any of that group.

19:38.458 --> 19:40.917
They were college kids.
I was a working guy.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.083
Oh, we hear you
boxed people
out.

19:43.166 --> 19:45.083
Didn't want anybody
else hanging around.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.375
That's crap.

19:46.458 --> 19:48.542
I wasn't the reason
those friends busted up.

19:48.625 --> 19:50.000
(Scotty)
Meaning what?

19:50.083 --> 19:53.041
Sad truth is, it happens a lot
after accidents like that.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.083
People can't handle it,
don't know how to be.

19:55.166 --> 19:58.166
- Knew about Angus proposing?
- Not back then.

19:58.250 --> 20:00.625
But it's not something
I would've been concerned
about.

20:00.709 --> 20:01.709
Why is that?

20:01.792 --> 20:03.166
Angus was always
gonna be the reason

20:03.250 --> 20:04.917
she's in that chair.
Simple as that.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.208
The letter we got says she was
considering marrying the guy.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.083
This might sound terrible

20:12.166 --> 20:13.667
but Vicky told me
the only reason

20:13.750 --> 20:15.250
she didn't say no right off

20:15.333 --> 20:18.792
is she thought Angus is the
only guy that'd ever want her.

20:18.875 --> 20:21.709
Where were you the
night
he was killed, Ian?

20:21.792 --> 20:22.917
Vick asked me to the movie

20:23.000 --> 20:25.417
but I had early shift
next day, stayed in.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.291
Not much of an alibi,
but it's the God's honest
truth.

20:28.375 --> 20:31.291
- We'll look into it.
- Of course.

20:31.375 --> 20:33.542
You have any thoughts
about who killed
Angus?

20:33.625 --> 20:36.417
We thought it was that Foster
guy. All the news said so.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.542
Now, you don't sound
so hundred percent.

20:39.917 --> 20:42.667
Something happened a few
weeks before Angus died.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.000
Hey, Mr. Leoni.

20:47.083 --> 20:48.041
- Morning.
- Devon.

20:48.125 --> 20:49.625
Where's, uh, Vicky?

20:49.709 --> 20:52.333
Uh, therapist said
a friend took her for a
walk.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.709
So, uh, Vicky tells me
you play football, huh?

20:54.792 --> 20:57.166
Yeah, he's been missing a lot
of practices to come see her.

20:57.250 --> 21:01.125
- It's no big deal.
- You're a good lil' bro,
kid.

21:01.208 --> 21:04.125
You know, she could walk again,
if she keeps working at it.

21:04.208 --> 21:06.583
- Dev, we've talked about
this.
- 'It's possible.'

21:06.667 --> 21:08.500
That's all I'm saying.

21:08.583 --> 21:10.625
"Possible."

21:10.709 --> 21:12.417
Right?

21:14.333 --> 21:16.625
Well, we can pray for it,
that's for sure.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.125
(Vicky
'She's totally evil.'

21:18.208 --> 21:20.917
She yells at me
after every exercise.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.458
(Vicky)
Hi,
guys.

21:28.250 --> 21:30.333
- Oh, God, Vicky, I'm sorry.
- Are you retarded?

21:30.417 --> 21:32.000
Can't you do anything
without hurting
somebody?

21:32.083 --> 21:33.333
- Pop!
- Mr. Leonie..

21:33.417 --> 21:34.917
You walk in with this
stupid grin on the face

21:35.000 --> 21:36.291
like something's funny.

21:36.375 --> 21:37.792
I should just
knock it right off!

21:37.875 --> 21:40.709
- Easy there.
- Get out!

21:40.792 --> 21:42.041
I was just trying to help.

21:42.125 --> 21:43.875
It's a lil' too late for that.

21:43.959 --> 21:45.917
Too late?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.375
God, can't you see
you're making it
worse?

21:48.458 --> 21:49.875
(Angus)
'Acting like somebody died.'

21:50.959 --> 21:53.208
She didn't die.

21:53.291 --> 21:55.583
She's right here!

22:03.291 --> 22:05.041
Vicky didn't tell us about that.

22:05.125 --> 22:07.125
I shouldn't have
said anything.

22:07.208 --> 22:09.375
Guy's lost his wife early.
Those kids were all he had.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.041
Of course he was messed up.

22:11.125 --> 22:14.083
- Her father a violent guy?
- Never knew him that way.

22:14.166 --> 22:18.166
But Vick and him stopped
talking
as soon as she moved out.

22:18.250 --> 22:19.417
And why is that?

22:19.500 --> 22:20.834
All she said about
it was the accident

22:20.917 --> 22:23.125
made him a different guy.

22:25.041 --> 22:27.667
Mrs. McGowan.

22:27.750 --> 22:28.750
I heard the messages
on the machine

22:28.834 --> 22:30.458
that they
were looking for you.

22:30.542 --> 22:32.917
(Lilly)
We're just asking him
some questions, that's all.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.417
Babe, I'm fine. You
didn't
need to come down here.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.208
Yeah, I did.

22:37.291 --> 22:39.875
My husband didn't hurt Angus.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.959
And I can prove it.

22:42.041 --> 22:43.083
Yeah? How?

22:43.166 --> 22:44.417
I should've done
this a long time ago.

22:44.500 --> 22:47.500
I just...couldn't
face it. I'm sorry.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.875
Vick, wha-what's going on?

22:59.333 --> 23:01.750
Where'd you get that, Vicky?

23:01.834 --> 23:05.500
I found it hidden
in my father's hall closet.

23:05.583 --> 23:08.083
The day after
Angus was murdered.

23:22.041 --> 23:24.583
Vicky gave us the
knife, Mr. Leoni.

23:24.667 --> 23:26.250
(Will)
'Someone tried
to wipe it clean'

23:26.333 --> 23:28.125
but there was
residue,
looked like blood.

23:28.208 --> 23:29.667
What are you talking about?

23:29.750 --> 23:32.125
The knife she found
hidden
in your hall closet

23:32.208 --> 23:34.417
'the day after
Angus' murder.'

23:36.709 --> 23:39.834
So that's why she
kicked me out of her life.

23:39.917 --> 23:42.959
<i>was yours?</i>

23:44.000 --> 23:46.959
Yeah, it was mine.

23:47.041 --> 23:48.834
Blood's mine, too.

23:48.917 --> 23:52.000
I remember I-I cut
myself making a salad.

23:53.250 --> 23:56.500
So why'd you hide
it in the closet?

23:56.583 --> 23:58.625
I, uh, put it aside.

23:58.709 --> 24:01.291
I was gonna take it
in to get sharpened.

24:01.375 --> 24:02.834
Ah.

24:02.917 --> 24:05.750
And you remember that
all these years later?

24:05.834 --> 24:08.000
Yeah, I do.

24:08.083 --> 24:10.250
You must have been
pretty angry at
Angus.

24:10.333 --> 24:13.500
What he did to
Vicky.
It's just human.

24:13.583 --> 24:15.041
Oh, I was furious at first.

24:15.125 --> 24:16.500
And we heard
about the
hospital.

24:16.583 --> 24:18.667
How you got up in
his face, threatened
him.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.542
I lost my temper, th-that's all.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.166
No, I don't blame you.

24:23.250 --> 24:26.375
(Will)
I know you loved that girl
with everything you had.

24:26.458 --> 24:27.625
Of course I did.

24:27.709 --> 24:29.125
Bet her whole life,
all you thought
about

24:29.208 --> 24:30.875
was keeping her safe.

24:30.959 --> 24:35.917
Making sure she never even
so much as scraped a knee.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.542
Then look what this
stupid,
reckless boy does

24:39.625 --> 24:41.583
without a moment's thought.

24:41.667 --> 24:44.875
- But I forgave the kid.
- That's a damn lie.

24:44.959 --> 24:46.875
You never forgive
something like
that.

24:55.166 --> 24:56.417
Hey.

24:57.667 --> 24:59.208
- Hey.
- I'm Detective Jeffries.

24:59.291 --> 25:02.250
They radioed my wife
was in an accident.

25:02.333 --> 25:04.250
Detective.

25:04.333 --> 25:05.709
I'm sorry, sir.

25:05.792 --> 25:07.917
Where's my wife, officer?

25:11.792 --> 25:14.458
Name on the ID
was Mary Jeffries.

25:20.667 --> 25:24.166
She was gonna
change the tire?

25:24.250 --> 25:26.208
Yes, sir.

25:26.291 --> 25:28.250
Trucker must not have seen
her get out of the vehicle.

25:28.333 --> 25:31.125
No, it's not right.
Mary would wait for
me.

25:31.208 --> 25:34.417
I...should have
been with her,
tonight.

25:36.333 --> 25:39.083
If I had just
been with
her..

25:39.166 --> 25:41.542
Can I call someone for you?

26:16.000 --> 26:19.041
They ever find that trucker?

26:19.125 --> 26:21.458
No.

26:21.542 --> 26:23.792
But if they had,
I might have killed
him.

26:23.875 --> 26:27.500
- I don't think so.
- And why is that?

26:27.583 --> 26:29.125
Because you would
have looked at him

26:29.208 --> 26:30.834
and you would have
seen some poor stiff

26:30.917 --> 26:32.709
who was driving a night shift

26:32.792 --> 26:34.667
just trying to get
home to his family.

26:34.750 --> 26:37.458
(Mr. Leoni)
'Too scared to stop,
to face what he did.'

26:38.458 --> 26:39.792
You defending what he did?

26:39.875 --> 26:41.625
No, I'm just saying that..

26:41.709 --> 26:43.417
...you probably would
have seen right off

26:43.500 --> 26:46.834
what it took me a long
time to see in Angus.

26:46.917 --> 26:48.959
It was just an accident.

26:50.792 --> 26:52.125
And the truth is..

26:52.208 --> 26:56.041
...on a bad night it could
have been you or me driving.

27:03.166 --> 27:05.667
Well, maybe you forgave Angus.

27:05.750 --> 27:08.333
But someone else
in your house
didn't.

27:09.792 --> 27:12.917
If forensics find
that knife killed him

27:13.000 --> 27:17.041
there's only one other
person who had access to
it.

27:17.125 --> 27:19.166
Your son.

27:21.375 --> 27:24.250
So the knife
was yours, wasn't it?

27:24.333 --> 27:26.125
Yeah, it was mine. So what?

27:26.208 --> 27:28.125
I was a kid. I got it
for part of a costume.

27:28.208 --> 27:30.625
Oh, you need a ten-inch steak
knife for a Halloween costume?

27:30.709 --> 27:32.125
I wanted it
to look
real.

27:32.208 --> 27:34.000
I got the Michael Myers
mask, the gray jumper--

27:34.083 --> 27:35.458
But why'd you hide the knife?

27:35.542 --> 27:37.333
I threw it there as soon
as I heard about the
murder.

27:37.417 --> 27:40.500
I didn't want my pop to
see
it in the trash and flip
out.

27:40.583 --> 27:41.750
'I was gonna
ditch the
knife'

27:41.834 --> 27:43.375
in a dumpster
later
but it was gone.

27:43.458 --> 27:45.709
And you don't ask Vicky or
your
pop about it going missing?

27:45.792 --> 27:47.500
You don't understand
what my house was
like

27:47.583 --> 27:48.709
after that accident.

27:48.792 --> 27:51.417
I was just trying to disappear.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.500
Not upset anybody ever.

27:56.166 --> 27:59.375
You must have hated Angus
for doing that to your life.

27:59.458 --> 28:01.625
I hated the world
after what happened to
Vick.

28:03.375 --> 28:05.500
She always looked out for me.

28:05.583 --> 28:07.083
And that's the
hand
life dealt her?

28:07.166 --> 28:09.166
Angus

28:09.250 --> 28:12.417
Yeah, that's right.

28:12.500 --> 28:15.000
And then he's psycho enough
to ask her to marry him.

28:25.667 --> 28:28.208
(Vicky)
'I just saw you
an hour ago, Angus.'

28:28.291 --> 28:30.041
'It's not exactly
giving me time.'

28:30.125 --> 28:32.125
(Vicky)
I said all of this
in the letter.

28:32.208 --> 28:33.875
I'm ignoring the letter.

28:33.959 --> 28:37.208
Look, Angus, I know
you're
just doing this out of
guilt.

28:42.208 --> 28:44.750
I love you, Vicky Leoni.

28:44.834 --> 28:47.417
Hasn't changed since ninth
grade, and it's not gonna now.

28:47.500 --> 28:49.250
Quit it.

28:49.333 --> 28:52.625
Stand up.

28:52.709 --> 28:55.792
I am messed up, alright?

28:55.875 --> 28:57.792
Things don't..

28:57.875 --> 29:01.458
...work right anymore.
<i>You get it?</i>

29:01.542 --> 29:05.792
<i>that</i>
I care about that stuff?

29:05.875 --> 29:07.125
Look, I know I'm a geek.

29:08.333 --> 29:10.291
And you deserve way better.

29:10.375 --> 29:14.291
I mean, look at you. You take
my
freakin' breath away.

29:14.375 --> 29:16.750
(Angus)
'Maybe this is right.'

29:16.834 --> 29:20.500
You and me.

29:20.583 --> 29:21.667
Angus.

29:21.750 --> 29:24.208
What are you doing?

29:24.291 --> 29:26.667
Are you psycho
acting like this?

29:26.750 --> 29:29.500
- Devon, it's okay.
- Look what he did to you!

29:29.583 --> 29:31.417
How can you say that's okay?

29:31.500 --> 29:33.375
(Devon)
'That's not okay to me.'

29:33.458 --> 29:35.041
I'm gonna wake up my pop
and tell him you're here.

29:35.125 --> 29:37.250
Alright, alright, Dev.

29:37.333 --> 29:39.458
I'm going, man.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.500
Craig was outside your house?

29:52.583 --> 29:55.166
Yeah. He was out there
all the time back then.

29:55.250 --> 29:56.583
Doing what?

29:56.667 --> 29:57.875
Just sat on his bike

29:57.959 --> 30:01.333
watching the place,
night after night.

30:01.417 --> 30:05.208
(Lilly)
So Craig lied. He still
had a soft spot for
Vicky.

30:05.291 --> 30:06.458
Even after the crash.

30:06.542 --> 30:07.917
(Josie)
But Devon was telling the
truth.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.291
Knife doesn't match the wounds.

30:09.375 --> 30:12.458
Bloodstains on the
handle.
Cornstarch.

30:12.542 --> 30:14.000
- Costume blood.
- Yep.

30:14.083 --> 30:15.250
Here's something.

30:15.333 --> 30:17.083
Chemical tests on Angus'
clothes came back.

30:17.166 --> 30:18.834
Picked up traces of elk skin.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.208
What's elk skin used for?

30:20.291 --> 30:23.125
Most common use,
motorcycle gloves.

30:23.208 --> 30:26.375
And it's our boy Craig
<i>beautiful ride.</i>

30:32.625 --> 30:35.166
Devon told us about your
stalker
routine outside Vicky's place.

30:37.834 --> 30:39.291
You still in love
means
you've got the
motive

30:39.375 --> 30:41.375
to get rid of your competition.

30:41.458 --> 30:44.250
You don't understand.

30:44.333 --> 30:46.250
We're a little dim.

30:46.333 --> 30:47.667
Why don't you
explain it to
us?

30:47.750 --> 30:50.041
I just wanted to talk to her.

30:50.125 --> 30:51.583
Beg her to forgive me.

30:51.667 --> 30:53.750
Forgive you? For what?

30:56.083 --> 30:57.166
What I did.

30:57.250 --> 30:58.458
You talking about
the night of the
murder?

30:58.542 --> 31:00.917
No, I'm talking
about the crash.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.834
What happened there?

31:05.542 --> 31:06.959
You're on the hook for
murder,
Craig.

31:07.041 --> 31:08.625
And we're losing
our patience
here.

31:12.500 --> 31:15.875
I was right there
when it happened.

31:15.959 --> 31:19.291
I could have helped her,
but I froze.

31:39.041 --> 31:40.458
(Donna)
'Oh, my God.'

31:40.542 --> 31:44.041
Please, someone get
help!
Call for help!

31:45.458 --> 31:47.041
(Vicky)
My leg hurts.

31:48.250 --> 31:50.709
Oh, God, it hurts!

31:50.792 --> 31:51.792
Oh, my God.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.083
Craig...are you there?

32:00.166 --> 32:01.500
Craig, help me!

32:01.583 --> 32:03.667
(Vicky)
<i>Oh, Craig, help me!'</i>

32:05.750 --> 32:07.208
(Vicky)
'Craig.'

32:07.291 --> 32:09.667
Oh, help me.

32:09.750 --> 32:11.417
(Vicky)
'Craig.'

32:14.000 --> 32:15.333
Oh, man.

32:15.417 --> 32:17.375
Hang on. We're gonna
get you out of there.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.542
(Vicky)
'Craig, are you there?'

32:23.500 --> 32:25.041
'Craig?'

32:25.125 --> 32:27.291
Craig, are you there?

32:27.375 --> 32:29.208
It's jammed tight.

32:31.041 --> 32:34.208
[grunting]
Oh, help me...Craig.

32:34.291 --> 32:35.667
- Hang on.
- Easy there.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.125
I gotta get her outta
here before it catches.

32:37.208 --> 32:39.375
(Vicky)
'Craig?'

32:41.333 --> 32:43.000
(fireman #1)
'Easy. Easy.'

32:43.083 --> 32:44.542
'Craig, are you there?'

32:45.959 --> 32:47.166
Please help me.

32:47.250 --> 32:49.208
'Craig!'

32:49.291 --> 32:50.625
'Are you there?'

32:52.333 --> 32:53.875
[echoing]
'Are you there, Craig?'

32:57.750 --> 32:59.250
I couldn't move.

32:59.333 --> 33:01.875
(Craig)
'I was a pathetic coward.'

33:01.959 --> 33:04.166
I blamed Angus for all of it.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.875
But I didn't kill him.

33:08.458 --> 33:11.333
So you were hanging around
her house to apologize?

33:12.750 --> 33:16.875
Night after night,
trying to get up the nerve.

33:16.959 --> 33:19.500
But I never did.

33:19.583 --> 33:22.458
Craig, you heard
Vicky say her leg
hurt.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.667
- 'You sure about that?'
- Yeah.

33:24.750 --> 33:28.083
And you saw her try
and kick off the seat
belt?

33:28.166 --> 33:30.792
Yeah. So?

33:33.667 --> 33:36.041
[quietly]
Angus wasn't studying
to be a fireman.

33:49.875 --> 33:51.417
(Vicky)
Did you find something
out?

33:52.166 --> 33:53.792
Yeah, we did.

33:53.875 --> 33:55.250
Was it..?

33:55.333 --> 33:57.834
Did my father kill Angus?

33:57.917 --> 33:59.083
No.

34:00.166 --> 34:01.834
But you knew that.

34:01.917 --> 34:03.375
What?

34:03.458 --> 34:05.417
What are you talking about?

34:05.500 --> 34:07.500
Ian couldn't have put
the knife there.

34:07.583 --> 34:09.917
That knife didn't kill Angus.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.875
It was part of your
brother's Halloween costume.

34:14.875 --> 34:16.291
We talked to your old partner

34:16.375 --> 34:18.250
the one who covered
for you way back when.

34:18.333 --> 34:22.458
(Scotty)
We know things went wrong
when you used the Jaws of
Life.

34:22.542 --> 34:26.458
"A terrible mistake,"
your partner said.

34:26.542 --> 34:29.875
"Made by an eager,
real talented rookie."

34:29.959 --> 34:31.709
(Scotty)
And Angus figured it out.

34:31.792 --> 34:33.333
Started reading up.

34:33.417 --> 34:35.834
Ian, what's going on?

34:37.500 --> 34:39.250
I had to get you out.

34:39.333 --> 34:42.625
Smoke was coming
out of that engine.

34:42.709 --> 34:44.417
You saved me.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.417
(Lilly)
'He was trying to save you.'

34:46.500 --> 34:48.500
He saw the car
was about to catch fire.

34:49.917 --> 34:54.083
I moved too fast. The last
push knocked you forward.

34:57.542 --> 35:01.125
[gentle laugh]
And that's what broke my
spine.

35:04.583 --> 35:06.333
Ian.

35:06.417 --> 35:10.750
- What'd you do to Angus?
- No! Not that sweet kid.

35:12.083 --> 35:16.458
The residue on
Angus' body was elk skin.

35:16.542 --> 35:20.667
Only other use besides
motorcycle gloves is..

35:20.750 --> 35:22.709
'...firemen's gloves.'

35:24.583 --> 35:27.208
He came to me.

35:28.375 --> 35:32.208
I didn't go to him.
He came to me.

35:36.291 --> 35:37.709
(man on TV)
'To the real Halloween
killer'

35:37.792 --> 35:39.250
'including the live update'

35:39.333 --> 35:40.917
'from the Gray's
Ferry neighborhood'

35:41.000 --> 35:42.959
<i>struck</i>
<i>just last night.'</i>

35:53.583 --> 35:56.000
Angus.

35:56.083 --> 35:58.041
- How was the movie?
- I figured it out, Ian.

35:58.125 --> 36:00.375
After the car flipped over,
Vicky was crying out.

36:00.458 --> 36:02.750
She said her leg hurt.
<i>hurt!</i>

36:02.834 --> 36:05.291
She was delusional, Angus.
Didn't know what was going
on.

36:05.375 --> 36:07.625
Yes, she did.
She felt it, man.

36:07.709 --> 36:10.041
And I know all
about the Jaws of
Life

36:10.125 --> 36:11.375
and how you messed up.

36:11.458 --> 36:12.750
You're nuts, Angus.

36:12.834 --> 36:14.041
Now, I've been as nice
to you as I can be.

36:14.125 --> 36:15.083
But I'm getting sick of it.

36:15.166 --> 36:16.750
Yeah, you were nice..

36:16.834 --> 36:18.417
...right off the bat,
and you didn't even know
me.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.875
No, it was like you
didn't blame me at
all.

36:20.959 --> 36:22.667
Time to go home.
Sleep it off, buddy.

36:22.750 --> 36:24.417
You're just with
her out of guilt.

36:24.500 --> 36:27.875
I just wanna be near her, but
you wanna ease your conscience.

36:29.166 --> 36:32.166
Vicky and I can
be happy
together.

36:33.500 --> 36:36.083
Just tell 'em
what you did,
Ian.

36:36.166 --> 36:39.375
She won't
believe
me if I do it.

36:39.458 --> 36:42.583
I didn't do anything.

36:42.667 --> 36:44.166
You're a total fraud!

36:44.250 --> 36:46.709
Everyone thinks
you're some big
hero!

36:46.792 --> 36:48.083
But I'm gonna
tell 'em the
truth!

36:48.166 --> 36:49.709
Look, you little pissant!

36:49.792 --> 36:50.917
You crashed the car!

36:51.041 --> 36:52.417
And when you were
crawling away

36:52.500 --> 36:54.542
on your hands and knees,
I was saving her life!

36:54.625 --> 36:55.834
But you lied!

36:55.917 --> 36:57.959
And I'm gonna tell
everybody what you
did!

36:58.041 --> 37:01.041
And then you're gonna know
<i>to be</i>
<i>hated</i>

37:01.125 --> 37:03.291
for one stupid mistake!

'The real Halloween Killer's
