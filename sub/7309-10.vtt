WEBVTT

00:03.613 --> 00:04.613
Check that eyebolt.

00:04.738 --> 00:06.810
- Just let that... on.
- Secure eyebolt.

00:07.146 --> 00:09.670
All right, get ready, ladies.
Put your backs into it.

00:10.194 --> 00:12.755
Come on, I used to do this
when I was your age by myself.

00:12.779 --> 00:13.938
- Sure, you did, boss.
- Yeah, right.

00:13.962 --> 00:14.997
See these pythons?

00:15.945 --> 00:18.860
I could lift a 400-pound
load back in the day, huh?

00:18.884 --> 00:21.311
I even remember her
name: Lisa Scarpizzee.

00:22.318 --> 00:24.291
Yeah, well she was a hell
of a woman though, huh?

00:24.656 --> 00:26.743
All right, let's move
this thing out of here.

00:26.767 --> 00:28.335
I've got a furnace waiting to go in.

00:28.453 --> 00:30.190
Push her out, guys. Come on, here we go.

00:31.216 --> 00:32.351
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:33.219 --> 00:33.760
Hey, Manny?

00:34.135 --> 00:34.530
Yeah?

00:34.737 --> 00:37.352
Looks like a partial
obstruction in the smokestack.

00:37.598 --> 00:39.079
Yeah, I see it from up here, boss.

00:39.168 --> 00:40.301
Probably carbon buildup.

00:40.637 --> 00:41.614
All right, clean it out.

00:41.653 --> 00:42.492
Doing that now.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.057
Anybody that doesn't want to make an ash

00:44.081 --> 00:45.430
of themselves, step back.

00:47.970 --> 00:49.535
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:50.029 --> 00:50.867
Hold it up, Manny.

00:51.025 --> 00:52.945
We've got more than just
carbon coming down here.

00:53.048 --> 00:54.048
Copy that.

01:52.147 --> 01:53.147
Finish McGee's book yet?

01:53.656 --> 01:54.370
Halfway.

01:54.578 --> 01:55.578
You?

01:56.959 --> 01:59.480
I'm on... chapter seven,

01:59.504 --> 02:02.099
page 103.

02:03.482 --> 02:04.482
"Maybe someday.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.183
"Lisa would find the
courage to tell agent Tommy

02:07.549 --> 02:09.864
"about her dream, the two
of them together, their

02:10.243 --> 02:12.610
"bodies covered in sweat
as they made love on

02:12.918 --> 02:14.843
the crystal white
sands of her homeland."

02:15.026 --> 02:16.152
I'm gonna kill him.

02:16.260 --> 02:17.618
- Kill who?
- McGee.

02:17.775 --> 02:18.780
Have you read this book?

02:18.836 --> 02:20.908
Apparently McGee thinks
Ziva's in love with me.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.144
There's a reason they
call it fiction, DiNozzo.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.564
Boss, just got a call from dispatch.

02:25.588 --> 02:27.144
Construction crew found a dead body.

02:27.254 --> 02:28.254
Where?

02:28.283 --> 02:29.814
Chesty Puller High School in Quantico.

02:30.146 --> 02:31.146
Student?

02:31.637 --> 02:33.039
Uh... not sure.

02:33.323 --> 02:34.763
Take the truck, I'll meet you there.

02:42.333 --> 02:43.580
How many times do I have to tell you...

02:43.604 --> 02:45.017
it's not about you guys.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.085
I'm driving.

02:51.770 --> 02:53.293
Comfortable back there, Gore Vidal?

02:55.264 --> 02:57.301
For the last time, Deep Six is fiction.

02:57.388 --> 02:58.776
Fiction based on us, yes?

02:59.224 --> 03:00.224
No.

03:00.321 --> 03:01.434
Look, if you don't believe me,

03:01.458 --> 03:03.218
read the disclaimer in
the front of the book.

03:03.896 --> 03:05.340
You buying that, Lisa?

03:06.934 --> 03:07.934
Didn't think so.

03:08.685 --> 03:09.685
Nice knowing you, Probie.

03:11.116 --> 03:12.116
Ziva...

03:15.597 --> 03:17.081
It's just a book!

03:20.710 --> 03:21.647
You know, in chapter eight

03:21.671 --> 03:22.866
of McGee's book, your character does

03:22.890 --> 03:24.638
the exact same thing to Agent Tommy.

03:25.168 --> 03:27.719
Turns out she has this whole
secret photo album of him.

03:28.224 --> 03:28.984
Fascinating, Tony,

03:29.008 --> 03:30.488
but I wasn't taking a picture of you.

03:31.028 --> 03:32.308
More interested in the wildlife.

03:34.262 --> 03:35.262
Ugh!

03:35.518 --> 03:37.611
We've pulled rats, cats

03:37.635 --> 03:39.901
and birds out of chimneys
before, Agent Gibbs.

03:40.406 --> 03:42.736
Hell, one time even a St. Bernard,

03:43.494 --> 03:45.123
but this is my first mummy.

03:46.582 --> 03:47.965
Reminds me of that urban legend.

03:48.938 --> 03:49.645
Which one is that?

03:49.878 --> 03:51.337
Guy dresses up like Santa,

03:51.363 --> 03:53.667
you know, for Christmas Eve
to surprise his girlfriend,

03:53.958 --> 03:55.158
but he never shows.

03:55.373 --> 03:57.419
She's convinced that
the bastard dumped her,

03:57.798 --> 03:59.263
badmouths him all over town.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.810
Until they find the poor soul's body

04:01.834 --> 04:05.454
months later still
clutching the little box

04:05.478 --> 04:07.877
with her shiny new engagement ring.

04:08.085 --> 04:10.220
And the moral of course is...

04:10.485 --> 04:12.272
"It's never a good idea to get married."

04:12.613 --> 04:15.922
No."It's best not to judge someone
until all the facts are in."

04:16.755 --> 04:17.755
I like mine better.

04:18.593 --> 04:20.469
Any of your crew touch
or move Kriss Kringle?

04:20.526 --> 04:22.738
No. Most of 'em were halfway to Manassas

04:22.762 --> 04:24.152
before the dust even settled.

04:24.657 --> 04:25.870
There's no I.D. on him.

04:25.908 --> 04:27.223
Judging by what's left of the mullet,

04:27.247 --> 04:29.035
I think it's safe to say
he wasn't in the military.

04:29.059 --> 04:30.227
You think, DiNozzo?

04:30.764 --> 04:31.764
Hey...

04:31.850 --> 04:33.018
I need a TOD, Doctor.

04:33.328 --> 04:36.134
Considering we've been working
together for over ten years,

04:36.158 --> 04:38.487
I am well aware of that, Agent Gibbs.

04:38.588 --> 04:40.258
DiNozzo, when he gets
one, run it through.

04:40.282 --> 04:42.163
Missing Persons over
the same time period.

04:42.643 --> 04:43.660
Where are you going, boss?

04:43.684 --> 04:44.961
To the roof, to figure out

04:44.985 --> 04:46.585
how he ended up there
in the first place.

04:47.499 --> 04:48.499
What happened to you?

04:48.644 --> 04:51.858
Uh, creative differences
with my coworkers, boss.

04:51.882 --> 04:53.633
A lot of that going around these days.

04:54.612 --> 04:57.012
Don't you think it's about time
you and Gibbs made up, Ducky?

04:57.226 --> 04:57.889
Made up?

04:57.990 --> 04:59.908
I wasn't aware we were fighting, Ziva.

05:00.249 --> 05:01.684
Come on. Ever since he retired...

05:01.708 --> 05:04.360
Gibbs didn't retire, he quit.

05:04.751 --> 05:07.549
Okay, so he quit, but he's back now.

05:07.725 --> 05:09.803
You need to cut the
man some slacks, Ducky.

05:10.157 --> 05:12.373
I agree. Except the term is "slack."

05:12.784 --> 05:15.590
Judging by the decay and
the condition of his skin,

05:15.614 --> 05:17.950
I'd tentatively place
the time of death at...

05:18.202 --> 05:19.964
two to four months ago.

05:20.375 --> 05:21.375
Works for me.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.865
Time of death was two
to four months ago, boss!

05:27.024 --> 05:28.546
Bag and tag the ashes, Probie.

05:28.913 --> 05:31.369
We'll pick you up after
we coordinate with the MPs.

05:32.026 --> 05:34.427
Doctor, I'm going to be
laying the bag out here

05:34.451 --> 05:35.451
and...

05:36.099 --> 05:37.886
the burrito over here.

05:40.204 --> 05:41.283
Palmer, I need a favor.

05:42.686 --> 05:43.886
You want to ride back with us.

05:44.429 --> 05:45.429
How'd you know?

05:45.824 --> 05:46.824
I read your book.

05:47.637 --> 05:48.339
And for your information,

05:48.363 --> 05:50.472
I've never had sexual
relations with a corpse.

05:50.712 --> 05:52.531
That character was not based on you.

05:52.726 --> 05:55.214
His name was Pimmy Jalmer, McGee.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.669
He's French Polynesian.

05:58.187 --> 05:59.860
Doctor, I'm going to get the gurney now.

06:01.117 --> 06:02.197
It was only a dream.

06:04.066 --> 06:05.944
Come on. Haven't you
ever heard of symbolism?

06:06.657 --> 06:09.607
The life of an artist
is never easy, McGee.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.436
They'll all get over it, eventually.

06:14.217 --> 06:15.217
Thanks, Ducky.

06:15.322 --> 06:18.454
By the way, do you know if
Tony has finished it yet?

06:19.363 --> 06:20.363
Not yet.

06:21.062 --> 06:22.470
Well, him I'd watch out for.

06:25.268 --> 06:27.240
None of the local missing person reports

06:27.264 --> 06:29.344
match our John Doe's description, Tony.

06:30.572 --> 06:32.513
And there's no record
of anyone going missing

06:32.537 --> 06:33.537
on base,

06:33.970 --> 06:36.647
civilian or military,
during that period.

06:37.620 --> 06:38.959
Are you even listening to me?

06:39.325 --> 06:41.346
I'm getting close to the end, Ziva.

06:43.436 --> 06:46.088
You know, McGee is really
starting to nail your essence here.

06:46.808 --> 06:47.808
"Stakeouts...

06:48.444 --> 06:50.029
"long, endless hours

06:50.092 --> 06:52.114
"fueled by cheap food

06:53.047 --> 06:54.399
"and even cheaper coffee.

06:55.422 --> 06:59.160
"But tonight, Mossad Officer
Lisa didn't seem to mind,

07:00.025 --> 07:01.782
"because she was getting to
spend it with Agent Tom...

07:01.806 --> 07:02.806
"Agent Tom..."

07:03.720 --> 07:05.120
You're behind me again, aren't you?

07:05.346 --> 07:06.346
Lucky Guess.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.142
You know, I think McGee's right.

07:09.523 --> 07:10.641
He was, was he?

07:11.462 --> 07:14.284
It takes almost all of my willpower

07:14.417 --> 07:16.684
to resist the urges I have
when I'm around you, Tony.

07:17.973 --> 07:18.973
Maybe...

07:20.259 --> 07:21.547
it's about time I just...

07:22.444 --> 07:23.637
give in, yes?

07:25.804 --> 07:27.082
And by "give in," you mean...?

07:27.106 --> 07:28.414
- Letting loose.
- Ah...

07:28.627 --> 07:30.010
Doing what comes naturally to me.

07:30.388 --> 07:32.001
Yeah, I thought I was
picking up that vibe

07:32.025 --> 07:33.705
the first time we went
undercover together.

07:34.525 --> 07:35.525
You were?

07:36.394 --> 07:38.056
In fact, I almost did it

07:38.080 --> 07:39.357
the first night in the hotel room.

07:39.381 --> 07:40.492
Hmm. Really?

07:40.979 --> 07:42.741
But my father wouldn't approve.

07:42.943 --> 07:44.344
Because I'm not Jewish.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.959
Because he gets very
angry when I kill...

07:47.313 --> 07:48.313
a co-worker.

07:49.580 --> 07:51.537
Like I believed you for even a second.

07:52.699 --> 07:53.760
I'm sure you didn't.

07:54.973 --> 07:56.362
You two done playing grabass?

07:56.602 --> 07:57.644
Oh, he started it.

07:57.877 --> 07:58.877
I'm ending it.

07:59.090 --> 07:59.711
Oh, I...

07:59.735 --> 08:01.780
Next person who mentions this book

08:01.804 --> 08:04.076
will be deep-sixed by me.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.907
I can completely live with that, boss.

08:05.933 --> 08:07.342
My point exactly, DiNozzo.

08:07.366 --> 08:08.528
You I.D. our victim yet?

08:08.744 --> 08:10.518
We're running him against
missing person cases

08:10.542 --> 08:12.652
reported over the
last six months, Gibbs.

08:12.822 --> 08:13.822
No hits yet.

08:14.186 --> 08:16.125
Um, I'm afraid that's my fault.

08:16.921 --> 08:18.076
It seems...

08:18.417 --> 08:20.526
my initial time of death

08:20.710 --> 08:22.643
wasn't completely accurate.

08:23.002 --> 08:23.976
As you will see,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.494
his body is almost perfectly preserved.

08:27.138 --> 08:29.641
Perfectly preserved for a rotted corpse,

08:29.665 --> 08:30.447
that is.

08:30.662 --> 08:32.342
Guy looks like a piece
of beef jerky, Duck.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.950
Gum tissue rots faster than the...

08:35.335 --> 08:36.554
outer flesh,

08:36.668 --> 08:39.402
due to the high degree of
bacteria inside the mouth.

08:39.957 --> 08:41.859
As you can see, his gums...

08:42.231 --> 08:43.475
are almost intact.

08:44.277 --> 08:45.597
Maybe he was just a good flosser.

08:47.252 --> 08:48.252
Shutting it, boss.

08:48.767 --> 08:49.443
How'd he die?

08:49.506 --> 08:51.287
Well, the "how" I'm still working on.

08:51.571 --> 08:53.063
It's made particularly difficult

08:53.087 --> 08:55.196
by the means by which
his body was preserved.

08:55.259 --> 08:57.071
He was quite literally smoked

08:57.311 --> 08:58.435
inside that chimney.

08:58.461 --> 08:59.144
Smoked?

08:59.414 --> 09:01.094
Yeah, like a fine cut of meat.

09:01.258 --> 09:02.635
So he really is a beef jerky.

09:02.856 --> 09:05.307
In a manner of speaking, yes, Tony.

09:05.331 --> 09:07.467
It's also the reason
why my time of death

09:07.491 --> 09:08.508
was so far off.

09:08.691 --> 09:10.402
More than two to four months, Ducky?

09:10.819 --> 09:11.819
It would seem so.

09:12.006 --> 09:12.423
How many?

09:12.973 --> 09:13.853
I would say

09:13.877 --> 09:16.591
we're looking at closer to five or six.

09:16.869 --> 09:18.599
Don't be so rough on yourself, Doctor.

09:18.776 --> 09:20.416
We're already running
the past six months.

09:20.614 --> 09:21.782
Not months...

09:22.893 --> 09:23.893
years.

09:27.453 --> 09:28.482
Abby, they hate me.

09:28.804 --> 09:30.086
They don't hate you, McGee.

09:30.585 --> 09:32.183
Ziva tried to kill me yesterday.

09:32.713 --> 09:33.713
Well...

09:34.324 --> 09:36.711
you did base all the
characters in your book on us

09:36.919 --> 09:38.479
and didn't ask our permission.

09:38.555 --> 09:40.923
Deep Six is a work of pure fiction.

09:43.619 --> 09:45.484
You described everything in my bedroom.

09:45.930 --> 09:46.930
Not everything.

09:47.876 --> 09:48.876
You still have those...

09:49.423 --> 09:50.743
Fantasize later, Hemingway.

09:52.309 --> 09:54.734
I got a match on two of
Old Smokey's fingerprints.

09:56.148 --> 09:57.165
- Whoa!
- What's wrong?

09:57.601 --> 09:59.293
The match file is restricted.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.386
I can't access it.

10:00.449 --> 10:01.201
That's not possible.

10:01.225 --> 10:03.121
NCIS has top-level clearance.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.724
Duh, McGee. I work here, too.

10:05.311 --> 10:06.493
Can you tell who's blocking it?

10:06.517 --> 10:07.218
I could...

10:07.288 --> 10:09.967
if they weren't in the process of
deleting the file from the server.

10:09.991 --> 10:11.236
What the hell is this?

10:11.260 --> 10:12.422
I was wondering that myself.

10:12.586 --> 10:14.028
We got two matching fingerprints

10:14.052 --> 10:16.211
from the victim and
AFIS just kicked us out.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.657
And now they're deleting the file.

10:17.916 --> 10:18.276
How?

10:18.724 --> 10:19.724
Working on it, boss.

10:19.905 --> 10:21.493
It looks like some agency

10:21.517 --> 10:23.153
doesn't want us to
know who the mummy is,

10:23.177 --> 10:24.177
Gibbs.

10:33.490 --> 10:36.344
Inbound G-Five from Ibiza, Spain.

10:36.508 --> 10:37.261
Tango-Eight,

10:37.285 --> 10:38.876
I want every bag coming off

10:38.914 --> 10:41.302
that plane tagged with a GPS marker.

10:41.396 --> 10:42.396
Eagle Six,

10:42.558 --> 10:44.024
remain in over-watch.

10:44.048 --> 10:46.682
Tango-Eight is on his own,
unless I clear you for backup.

10:46.713 --> 10:47.439
Solid Copy,

10:47.654 --> 10:49.624
Eagle Six remaining
in over-watch position.

10:55.901 --> 10:58.149
Bring up Tango-Eight's
feed on the big screen.

11:09.168 --> 11:09.731
Hey, there.

11:10.023 --> 11:11.023
How y'all doing?

11:11.484 --> 11:12.484
Toss 'em down, bro.

11:15.799 --> 11:16.502
Ooh.

11:16.526 --> 11:17.526
Louis Vuitton.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.440
Y'all aren't too friendly, are you?

11:32.518 --> 11:33.518
This is Eagle Six.

11:33.639 --> 11:34.641
Cabin crew are exiting.

11:35.083 --> 11:35.784
Tango-Eight,

11:35.966 --> 11:38.129
La Grenouille's people
are about to deplane.

11:49.051 --> 11:50.550
The smile was for me, dear boy.

11:51.521 --> 11:52.602
There's more luggage.

11:54.700 --> 11:55.700
Yes, sir.

12:02.958 --> 12:03.958
Good flight?

12:05.736 --> 12:07.204
Very nice, Kort, very nice.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.484
Martin, where's he been keeping you?

12:09.508 --> 12:10.526
The African market.

12:10.700 --> 12:11.702
Cape Town, mostly.

12:11.726 --> 12:12.886
- Not bad.
- Good.

12:15.173 --> 12:17.272
I need to see the passengers.

12:17.613 --> 12:18.623
We've arranged a meeting.

12:19.089 --> 12:20.089
Things are going well.

12:21.206 --> 12:22.564
Isolate and freeze frame.

12:39.495 --> 12:40.695
How long have you been here?

12:41.744 --> 12:43.787
Well, long enough to put
your luggage in the trunk.

12:44.521 --> 12:46.336
How long have you been working the line?

12:46.360 --> 12:47.551
I haven't seen you before.

12:48.056 --> 12:49.056
Oh...

12:49.231 --> 12:50.231
about five months...

12:50.517 --> 12:52.293
I'd say. You know, part-time. Weekends,

12:52.317 --> 12:53.397
nights, that sort of thing.

12:58.352 --> 13:00.175
Can you keep your
eyes off her next time?

13:01.846 --> 13:02.846
Probably not.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.661
An honest man.

13:09.332 --> 13:10.332
Thank you, sir.

13:14.406 --> 13:17.658
Eagle Six, confirm four GPS markers.

13:17.824 --> 13:20.602
Eagle Six. Four GPS markers confirmed.

13:20.878 --> 13:22.432
Signals are long and strong.

13:23.299 --> 13:25.232
Bravo Zulu, Tango-Eight.

13:25.698 --> 13:26.698
Bravo...

13:27.156 --> 13:28.156
Two hours.

13:28.395 --> 13:29.666
Gibbs is going to murder me.

13:36.112 --> 13:37.696
How long's Tony been doing errands

13:37.720 --> 13:38.720
for the director?

13:39.190 --> 13:40.800
Pretty much since you retired.

13:41.431 --> 13:42.431
She trusts him.

13:43.420 --> 13:44.420
To do what?

13:45.438 --> 13:46.558
You'd have to ask Tony that.

13:46.954 --> 13:47.996
Gibbs! Gibbs! Gibbs!

13:48.405 --> 13:49.405
I did it!

13:49.454 --> 13:50.639
Well, you mean "we."

13:50.867 --> 13:52.587
There is no "we" in McGee.

13:53.045 --> 13:54.141
I traced the connection back

13:54.165 --> 13:55.933
to the system that deleted
the fingerprint match.

13:55.957 --> 13:57.841
It's a government server
in Arlington, Virginia.

13:57.865 --> 14:00.106
Routed into AFIS directly at the source.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.300
Our mystery hacker is... The FBI.

14:02.568 --> 14:05.464
Uh, yeah. Sounds a little
anticlimactic when you say it.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.046
How did you know that?

14:07.625 --> 14:08.625
I'm looking at 'em.

14:11.263 --> 14:13.511
You've got something
that belongs to me, Gibbs.

14:15.971 --> 14:17.337
Petri dish, Mr. Palmer.

14:17.361 --> 14:19.926
There's something weird in
this young man's stomach.

14:21.644 --> 14:22.644
Is that...

14:22.782 --> 14:23.862
is that what I think it is?

14:24.296 --> 14:26.301
A distal interphlangeal joint.

14:27.215 --> 14:28.215
A human toe.

14:28.659 --> 14:29.851
He was a cannibal, Ducky...

14:30.206 --> 14:31.390
and a serial killer.

14:33.354 --> 14:35.974
I've been hunting this
bastard for 12 years, Gibbs.

14:36.171 --> 14:37.171
What's his name?

14:40.360 --> 14:41.360
You don't know.

14:42.546 --> 14:44.100
We know the prints you ran through AFIS

14:44.124 --> 14:46.302
matched two of the prints
from his crime scenes.

14:46.507 --> 14:47.847
Fourteen kills...

14:48.621 --> 14:49.621
all women...

14:49.968 --> 14:50.968
drugged,

14:51.216 --> 14:54.136
strangled, left to rot near
rural, interstate highways.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.574
Every one of them missing
the toes on their left foot.

14:57.545 --> 14:58.545
They were gnawed off.

15:00.685 --> 15:01.388
How'd he die?

15:01.546 --> 15:02.906
Well, we're still working on that.

15:02.949 --> 15:03.949
I can tell you when.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.035
66 months ago.

15:06.430 --> 15:07.602
Five-and-a-half years.

15:07.913 --> 15:09.153
That's a pretty accurate guess.

15:09.458 --> 15:10.458
It wasn't a guess.

15:11.164 --> 15:12.457
It was the last time he killed.

15:17.143 --> 15:19.550
You want to know why I
restricted access to his prints.

15:20.308 --> 15:21.308
For starters.

15:22.115 --> 15:23.298
We didn't want local LEOs

15:23.322 --> 15:24.842
trying to bring him down on their own.

15:25.128 --> 15:26.951
That sounds like the FBI.

15:27.054 --> 15:28.638
Well, this guy was a ghost, Jethro.

15:29.309 --> 15:31.613
Fourteen murders, all
we ever got from him

15:31.637 --> 15:33.732
was two partials and a
single strand of hair.

15:34.218 --> 15:35.448
We never even got close.

15:35.843 --> 15:37.391
I am more interested
in what he was doing

15:37.415 --> 15:39.190
on my Marine base, Tobias.

15:39.301 --> 15:41.301
As soon as I find out,
you'll be the first to know.

15:43.096 --> 15:44.096
We got a deal?

15:46.488 --> 15:48.368
I'll have my M.E. swing
by and pick up the body.

15:48.965 --> 15:51.901
After I find out who
he is and how he died.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.719
I've spent 12 years
working on this case.

15:54.743 --> 15:56.447
Well, then waiting a few extra days

15:56.471 --> 15:57.488
shouldn't be a problem.

15:59.373 --> 16:00.865
Is there anything else I can do for you

16:00.889 --> 16:02.289
while you're grinding the knife in?

16:02.427 --> 16:03.886
I'm gonna need a sample of that hair

16:04.368 --> 16:05.417
and copies of your files.

16:06.001 --> 16:08.138
A few bottles of bourbon
would be a nice gesture.

16:08.573 --> 16:10.056
What do I get, besides a headache?

16:10.466 --> 16:11.951
Tobias, I am going to show you

16:11.975 --> 16:13.736
what your serial killer looks like.

16:13.950 --> 16:14.889
I've been rehydrating.

16:14.913 --> 16:16.585
Smokey the Bear's head since yesterday.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.266
It makes it easier for identification.

16:18.361 --> 16:21.320
And I've uploaded every
local missing person's sketch

16:21.344 --> 16:23.056
and photo into the comparison fields

16:23.080 --> 16:24.491
since the killings stopped.

16:24.531 --> 16:26.668
As soon as the rendering
algorithm is complete,

16:26.692 --> 16:28.579
we should have a
fairly accurate likeness

16:28.603 --> 16:30.653
of what Slim Jim looked
like when he was still alive.

16:30.677 --> 16:32.113
As long as the quadrant system

16:32.137 --> 16:33.913
and scales are within the
program's proscribed...

16:33.937 --> 16:34.455
McGee...

16:34.629 --> 16:36.721
less talk, more of the
the computer chip doo-da.

16:37.739 --> 16:39.229
Making with the doo-da, boss.

16:39.806 --> 16:40.806
"Doo-da"?

16:41.225 --> 16:42.835
Yeah, it's a technical term, Tobias.

16:43.309 --> 16:44.309
You wouldn't understand.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.615
- Pretty cute for a serial.
- Killing cannibal.

16:49.005 --> 16:52.493
Well, I've got an 86%
match on a Charles Bright,

16:52.816 --> 16:54.181
reported missing from Dale City,

16:54.205 --> 16:55.783
five years, seven months ago.

16:56.145 --> 16:57.541
Our profiler was convinced

16:57.565 --> 16:59.506
he'd have at least one
body buried near his home.

16:59.553 --> 17:00.011
Why?

17:00.074 --> 17:01.874
Something for him to gloat over, Ab.

17:01.898 --> 17:03.996
Relive the rush anytime he wanted to.

17:04.540 --> 17:05.540
That's good, Gibbs.

17:06.001 --> 17:07.001
We need an address.

17:08.682 --> 17:10.742
* Do-do-do, do-do-do *

17:10.766 --> 17:12.301
* Do-da. * * Do-da. * * Do-da. *

17:14.157 --> 17:15.157
That address still good?

17:16.492 --> 17:18.002
Uh, wife still lives there.

17:18.180 --> 17:18.970
Karen Bright,

17:19.057 --> 17:20.617
she's the one who reported him missing.

17:21.085 --> 17:22.085
There you go, Fornell.

17:23.648 --> 17:24.809
You're turning the case over?

17:25.078 --> 17:27.146
No. I just want you to get
my search warrant for me.

17:33.864 --> 17:36.161
I do miss you. I do.

17:39.648 --> 17:40.648
Stop.

17:42.331 --> 17:43.822
No, no.

17:43.846 --> 17:44.982
What's wrong with this picture?

17:45.006 --> 17:46.741
Besides being late over two hours?

17:46.978 --> 17:49.512
Why is the spawn of the
FBI sitting at my desk?

17:49.732 --> 17:51.934
Warrant just came in via the FBI.

17:51.958 --> 17:53.827
I made sure NCIS was a co-server.

17:53.851 --> 17:54.892
Warrant for what, Lee?

17:54.995 --> 17:56.430
The serial killer's home.

17:56.454 --> 17:58.514
It covers the grounds and residence.

17:58.727 --> 18:00.612
Serial killer? I only
missed like two hours...

18:00.927 --> 18:03.327
Snooze you lose,
DiNozzo. Grab your gear.

18:03.633 --> 18:04.633
I already have my gear.

18:04.762 --> 18:06.102
Fill you in on the way. Let's go.

18:06.483 --> 18:07.524
Today, DiNozzo!

18:09.370 --> 18:10.370
Geez.

18:12.266 --> 18:13.266
What do we tell her?

18:13.307 --> 18:15.122
The truth, we found her husband.

18:16.273 --> 18:18.665
And the whole serial-killing
cannibalism thing?

18:21.615 --> 18:22.649
Not until we have to.

18:24.897 --> 18:26.601
Hi. Your mom home?

18:27.564 --> 18:28.564
Who is it, Amy?

18:29.663 --> 18:30.831
It's the police, Mom.

18:32.022 --> 18:33.022
Mrs. Bright, I'm...

18:39.076 --> 18:40.860
He's FBI Agent Fornell,

18:40.915 --> 18:42.713
I'm NCIS Special Agent Gibbs.

18:46.740 --> 18:48.962
You, you found him, didn't you?

18:49.005 --> 18:50.181
You found my husband Charlie?

18:51.002 --> 18:53.061
His body was discovered
yesterday in Quantico.

18:54.512 --> 18:55.962
It was an accident, wasn't it?

18:56.320 --> 18:58.197
He was a building inspector.

18:59.247 --> 19:00.991
The cause of death
is still undetermined.

19:01.865 --> 19:03.310
He would have never abandoned us.

19:04.328 --> 19:05.275
Everyone else thought it,

19:05.299 --> 19:06.819
but I always knew it couldn't be true.

19:10.334 --> 19:11.518
They found Daddy.

19:12.244 --> 19:13.491
They finally found him.

19:21.213 --> 19:22.563
I'm sorry about that, Jethro.

19:23.455 --> 19:25.507
She could have been a twin
to some of his victims.

19:25.774 --> 19:27.124
The loving husband,

19:27.321 --> 19:29.657
murdering and eating women
who look like his wife.

19:30.312 --> 19:32.553
It'll probably be
McGee's next bestseller.

19:33.002 --> 19:34.841
It amazes me how the truly sick ones

19:34.865 --> 19:36.080
are always the best liked

19:36.631 --> 19:37.744
pillars of the community.

19:38.091 --> 19:40.388
They're successful because
they blend in, Tobias.

19:40.412 --> 19:42.517
They go to church, they
coach Little League baseball.

19:42.580 --> 19:44.822
I was on the team that
nailed Bundy, Gibbs.

19:44.932 --> 19:47.093
And I'm familiar with
sick, charming bastards.

19:48.009 --> 19:49.689
That's probably why
we get along so well.

19:56.562 --> 19:57.896
Oh, I found something, boss!

20:00.619 --> 20:01.905
Found some bones fragments.

20:17.116 --> 20:19.359
Our serial killer spent
the last five years

20:19.383 --> 20:20.825
getting smoked and tenderized

20:20.849 --> 20:22.478
in the Puller High School chimney,

20:23.078 --> 20:24.838
only to fall out during the installation

20:24.862 --> 20:25.940
of the new furnace.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.920
I want to know how he
ended up that way, DiNozzo.

20:28.429 --> 20:30.937
Boss, he was a building
inspector for the D.O.D.

20:31.158 --> 20:33.209
When he disappeared in April, 2001,

20:33.233 --> 20:34.220
he was checking structures

20:34.244 --> 20:36.074
at Quantico and Little Creek.

20:36.230 --> 20:37.707
Puller High School was on his list.

20:37.880 --> 20:38.961
It could have been an accident.

20:38.985 --> 20:40.364
He could've fallen to his death while

20:40.388 --> 20:41.445
inspecting the school.

20:41.706 --> 20:42.706
How?

20:43.009 --> 20:43.695
Think about it.

20:43.719 --> 20:45.296
He couldn't just walk
on the military base.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.874
If he drove, they would
have found his car.

20:46.898 --> 20:48.761
A 2000 Honda Accord
disappeared with him.

20:49.786 --> 20:50.796
Fourteen victims,

20:50.907 --> 20:53.629
spread out from 1993 until his death.

20:54.174 --> 20:55.934
All of 'em looking
pretty much like his wife.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.422
Number 15

20:57.456 --> 20:59.188
found in his own backyard by

20:59.567 --> 21:00.567
yours truly,

21:00.861 --> 21:02.314
with the FBI digging for more.

21:02.338 --> 21:04.538
Why exactly are we letting
the FBI dig for more?

21:04.586 --> 21:06.235
They're doing our manual labor.

21:16.844 --> 21:18.297
Well, this is the last one, Ducky.

21:18.659 --> 21:19.913
Unless they find more.

21:22.233 --> 21:24.032
Yeah, well, this one's also a female,

21:24.080 --> 21:27.188
judging by the width
of the pelvic bones.

21:27.212 --> 21:30.329
With the almost complete lack of tissue,

21:30.353 --> 21:31.597
I think I'll refrain

21:31.621 --> 21:34.261
before I offer a
tentative time of death.

21:34.589 --> 21:36.096
Especially after the last time.

21:36.356 --> 21:38.670
Yes, I do deeply apologize for that.

21:38.747 --> 21:39.749
No, problems, Ducky.

21:40.302 --> 21:41.556
We all make mistakes, yes?

21:41.722 --> 21:43.386
Did I ever tell you about the time

21:43.410 --> 21:45.674
I shoved a French police
officer off a cliff?

21:46.053 --> 21:47.118
There was a lake below.

21:47.616 --> 21:49.665
Yeah, the man was all right,

21:49.689 --> 21:52.373
but they still issued
a warrant for my arrest.

21:52.700 --> 21:55.300
Gibbs and I managed to keep
two steps ahead of them.

21:55.671 --> 21:57.099
Eventually we escaped across

21:57.123 --> 21:58.922
the English Channel in a sailboat.

21:58.946 --> 22:00.957
You and Agent Gibbs were fugitives?

22:00.989 --> 22:02.552
Yes, for a short while.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.334
Until a young

22:04.700 --> 22:08.978
upcoming NCIS agent
had the charges dropped.

22:09.112 --> 22:10.112
Jenny.

22:13.404 --> 22:14.469
I mean, Director Shepard.

22:15.697 --> 22:17.884
Yeah, she was the one
who commandeered the boat.

22:17.908 --> 22:19.703
Director Shepard stole a boat?

22:19.981 --> 22:23.696
She wasn't the director
of NCIS at the time, McGee.

22:26.953 --> 22:28.153
Everything's going to be okay.

22:28.911 --> 22:30.351
- This is all a big...
- Mrs. Bright,

22:31.819 --> 22:34.737
I need to know how your
husband ended up in Quantico.

22:36.490 --> 22:37.930
He worked at all the bases.

22:40.157 --> 22:42.314
Don't you people understand you have him

22:42.344 --> 22:43.794
confused with someone else?

22:44.520 --> 22:45.845
Some kind of monster?

22:49.150 --> 22:50.150
Sweetheart.

22:50.588 --> 22:51.614
Go get your brother, okay.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.118
We're going to go to Grandma's house.

22:53.319 --> 22:54.319
Go on.

22:56.467 --> 22:57.882
Can't they just leave?

23:00.964 --> 23:02.785
My husband was one
of the most loving men

23:02.809 --> 23:04.340
on the planet, Agent Gibbs.

23:05.620 --> 23:07.018
He treated everyone with...

23:07.903 --> 23:09.262
kindness and decency.

23:10.562 --> 23:12.866
Ask anyone who knew
him, Agent Gibbs, anyone.

23:14.421 --> 23:16.766
They're removing four
bodies from your backyard.

23:19.668 --> 23:20.912
Do you know how many old, unmarked

23:20.936 --> 23:22.162
graveyards are in Virginia?

23:24.748 --> 23:26.148
When was the last time you saw him?

23:27.346 --> 23:29.506
He was driving to Little Creek. He was...

23:31.097 --> 23:32.940
supposed to call when
he got to his hotel.

23:33.701 --> 23:35.697
That's a long way from
Quantico where he ended up.

23:36.618 --> 23:37.618
I knew.

23:38.047 --> 23:39.887
I knew something was
wrong when he didn't call.

23:42.879 --> 23:44.980
You ever have one of those feelings?

23:46.500 --> 23:48.500
When you know something
terrible has just happened?

23:49.744 --> 23:50.744
Once.

23:55.337 --> 23:56.337
And did it?

24:01.144 --> 24:03.140
He didn't do these things, Agent Gibbs.

24:04.572 --> 24:06.176
And I'm sorry, but
there's nothing you people

24:06.200 --> 24:08.609
can do or say to ever
make me believe this.

24:25.198 --> 24:26.877
Stashing four bodies in the yard,

24:27.689 --> 24:29.209
that's more than just gloating, Gibbs.

24:29.934 --> 24:31.507
Well, they could be his first kills.

24:32.792 --> 24:34.152
I think we're running out of room.

24:34.375 --> 24:37.938
Yes, it won't be lonely
in the Mallard Inn tonight.

24:37.966 --> 24:40.131
How could someone do the
things this man did, Doctor?

24:40.601 --> 24:43.425
In some cases, there's
a physiological defect

24:43.482 --> 24:45.666
in the hard-wiring of their brains.

24:46.092 --> 24:48.016
A mechanism that precludes

24:48.040 --> 24:50.952
the ability to feel genuine emotion.

24:51.681 --> 24:53.349
Did you find anything
weird in this guy's brain?

24:53.373 --> 24:55.906
Like a tumor or a physical abnormality?

24:56.203 --> 24:57.203
I did not.

24:57.754 --> 24:58.874
Then how do you explain him?

24:59.395 --> 25:00.395
I can't.

25:00.530 --> 25:02.201
There is also evil

25:02.225 --> 25:04.927
in this world, and even
armed with all our...

25:05.512 --> 25:08.777
science and degrees,
it remains impenetrable.

25:09.392 --> 25:12.855
Perhaps because its
depths are unfathomable.

25:13.137 --> 25:15.065
There's a very good book that I...

25:17.105 --> 25:18.105
Oh.

25:18.343 --> 25:20.800
I seem to have left my bag in the van.

25:21.205 --> 25:22.738
Be a good lad and fetch it for me

25:22.762 --> 25:24.055
before you leave for the night.

25:24.740 --> 25:25.803
You got it, Doctor.

25:46.831 --> 25:47.831
Oh.

26:00.141 --> 26:01.661
Thought you might be needing a refill.

26:03.915 --> 26:04.915
Thanks.

26:05.207 --> 26:08.149
Today certainly brought
back a lot of memories.

26:11.884 --> 26:12.884
Yeah.

26:13.447 --> 26:16.280
It also made me realize that

26:16.568 --> 26:20.140
since your return I've been
acting a little like a...

26:20.169 --> 26:21.169
An ass?

26:22.388 --> 26:23.683
Well, something like that.

26:25.419 --> 26:26.419
I didn't notice.

26:29.247 --> 26:31.033
Yeah, you and I have been through a lot

26:31.092 --> 26:32.163
over the years.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.994
Look, I-I... I hate to

26:36.001 --> 26:38.210
use marriage as an analogy...

26:38.234 --> 26:39.234
Then don't.

26:39.266 --> 26:41.840
Just tell me what I did to piss you off.

26:42.452 --> 26:43.522
The night you retired,

26:43.546 --> 26:45.428
you asked me to drive you home.

26:46.202 --> 26:48.939
You didn't say a single
word the entire trip.

26:49.131 --> 26:52.399
No explanation, not even a good-bye.

26:55.590 --> 26:58.104
I was kind of still recovering
from the coma, Doctor.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.200
And Kelly and Shannon?

27:01.998 --> 27:03.819
All those years of friendship together,

27:03.843 --> 27:04.843
and somehow you...

27:05.113 --> 27:07.180
failed to mention
that you have a family?

27:07.204 --> 27:08.204
Had.

27:09.270 --> 27:10.270
Had a family.

27:17.239 --> 27:19.167
You know how I feel
about apologies, right?

27:19.672 --> 27:21.322
Yeah, they're a sign of weakness.

27:21.821 --> 27:22.934
Not between friends.

27:24.485 --> 27:25.722
I am sorry, Ducky.

27:27.468 --> 27:28.468
I should have told you.

27:30.919 --> 27:33.026
And I should have told
you something months ago.

27:34.081 --> 27:35.081
Welcome home.

27:39.754 --> 27:40.761
Thanks.

27:56.642 --> 27:58.056
Hope you had a better day than I did,

27:58.080 --> 27:59.080
Miss Jeanne Benoit.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.560
I've been thinking a
lot about you lately...

28:04.819 --> 28:07.015
and I'm really, really
trying to figure out a way

28:08.688 --> 28:09.791
to not screw this up.

28:20.548 --> 28:21.191
Tony.

28:21.239 --> 28:23.078
Hey. I thought you were sleeping.

28:23.442 --> 28:24.442
I was.

28:27.679 --> 28:28.679
So...

28:29.866 --> 28:30.866
how was your day?

28:31.875 --> 28:32.875
Well...

28:34.820 --> 28:36.735
you ever see The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre?

28:37.480 --> 28:38.540
Original or remake?

28:38.564 --> 28:39.564
Either.

28:40.390 --> 28:41.390
Neither.

28:41.589 --> 28:42.651
It was a lot like that...

28:43.764 --> 28:44.764
but worse.

28:46.050 --> 28:47.050
How about you?

28:47.144 --> 28:48.803
Kind of like a cross between...

28:49.625 --> 28:50.941
Trains, Planes and Automobiles

28:50.965 --> 28:52.356
and The Muppets Take Manhattan.

28:53.384 --> 28:54.513
That is a heady,

28:54.669 --> 28:57.618
heady brew of strange
cinematic references,

28:57.642 --> 28:59.082
and I don't know what to make of it.

29:00.142 --> 29:02.103
I interned at the Children's Ward today.

29:02.717 --> 29:04.360
- Ah...
- I felt kind of like that, too.

29:06.135 --> 29:07.536
Beautiful and clever.

29:08.658 --> 29:09.851
So why aren't you kissing me?

29:11.395 --> 29:12.729
And she's a mind reader.

29:13.045 --> 29:14.395
Not exactly. Stop...

30:02.802 --> 30:03.802
Are you on medication?

30:04.059 --> 30:05.411
Just had a good night last night.

30:05.737 --> 30:06.737
Doing what?

30:08.094 --> 30:09.094
The usual.

30:09.428 --> 30:10.438
The usual what?

30:11.110 --> 30:12.110
Night.

30:17.563 --> 30:18.925
You had sex, didn't you?

30:19.270 --> 30:20.270
What?

30:20.450 --> 30:21.540
It's okay to admit it.

30:21.662 --> 30:23.300
I mean, we're all adults here.

30:23.878 --> 30:26.353
That's a subject I'd be willing
to debate, Officer David.

30:27.639 --> 30:28.639
Where's Gibbs?

30:29.260 --> 30:30.755
Well, he must have
known you were coming,

30:30.779 --> 30:32.317
because he's not here.

30:33.251 --> 30:35.735
It was really more of a
courtesy call, DiNozzo,

30:36.512 --> 30:39.400
letting him know about
these orders from Justice

30:40.399 --> 30:42.045
the ones where the FBI

30:42.419 --> 30:44.612
is taking over your case.

30:47.433 --> 30:48.507
You sure he's not around?

30:50.426 --> 30:53.157
These are pretty clear-cut
orders, Agent Fornell.

30:53.489 --> 30:55.932
"And NCIS is hereby ordered to turn over

30:56.044 --> 30:59.366
full jurisdiction of the
Bright case to the FBI"

30:59.769 --> 31:02.244
by end of business today."

31:04.239 --> 31:06.009
Who did you have to
sleep with to get these?

31:06.033 --> 31:07.117
Director, please.

31:08.221 --> 31:11.377
A serial killer falls down
a chimney on a Marine base.

31:11.406 --> 31:13.717
Is that a logical way
to decide jurisdiction?

31:14.072 --> 31:16.467
It's been working for
us since around 1882.

31:16.947 --> 31:17.500
Sadly,

31:17.922 --> 31:19.202
Justice doesn't see it that way.

31:20.612 --> 31:22.940
The FBI's invested 12
years in this investigation.

31:23.014 --> 31:24.762
And my people made more progress

31:24.786 --> 31:26.468
in just three days. Now, I can see

31:26.492 --> 31:27.732
how that would be embarrassing.

31:27.974 --> 31:28.974
I'll get over it.

31:29.800 --> 31:30.800
No hard feelings, Jethro?

31:32.534 --> 31:33.534
No.

31:33.989 --> 31:36.005
Just need you to look at
something before you leave.

31:36.029 --> 31:37.887
You got that mustache
in a box, don't you?

31:39.281 --> 31:41.686
It took more time than I care to admit,

31:42.856 --> 31:45.886
but I finally managed
to solve the riddle

31:45.910 --> 31:47.848
of how our friend died.

31:48.817 --> 31:49.817
You may need this.

31:50.566 --> 31:51.566
Look closely.

31:52.072 --> 31:54.391
In the area of his abdomen,

31:54.870 --> 31:58.375
do you see anything resembling wounds?

32:00.988 --> 32:01.440
No.

32:01.538 --> 32:04.262
No, neither did I, until
I took a second look

32:04.463 --> 32:05.567
at the CAT scan.

32:05.835 --> 32:08.419
You see, smoking desiccates flesh,

32:08.649 --> 32:10.037
which is why it is the

32:10.061 --> 32:11.892
preferred method of preserving meat

32:11.916 --> 32:14.200
in less technologically advanced

32:14.224 --> 32:15.544
- societies...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:15.952 --> 32:16.991
How did he die, Doctor?

32:17.278 --> 32:19.000
Well, as the moisture was lost,

32:19.153 --> 32:20.175
the victim's tissue,

32:20.199 --> 32:22.685
which protected the
vital organs, shrank.

32:23.674 --> 32:25.474
You see these little black dots?

32:32.726 --> 32:33.726
Oh, yeah.

32:34.108 --> 32:37.085
He was stabbed repeatedly and fatally.

32:38.798 --> 32:39.798
With what?

32:40.800 --> 32:41.800
A safety pin?

32:41.838 --> 32:43.378
No, as I just explained,

32:43.448 --> 32:45.914
the shrinkage of the flesh is deceptive.

32:46.229 --> 32:48.647
Most likely it was an ice pick or a...

32:49.111 --> 32:50.779
Phillips-head screwdriver.

32:51.107 --> 32:53.080
Somebody killed your
serial killer, Fornell.

32:53.607 --> 32:54.836
On a Marine base...

32:55.087 --> 32:56.141
which means...

32:56.590 --> 32:59.004
it is still our jurisdiction.

33:13.287 --> 33:15.647
I've seen a lot of things
since I became a cop, Ziva,

33:16.374 --> 33:17.374
But this...

33:17.671 --> 33:19.603
a guy tortures and murders 19 women

33:19.627 --> 33:21.664
and then gets off on eating their toes?

33:22.357 --> 33:24.137
Whoever whacked this sick freak

33:24.489 --> 33:25.882
did us and the world a favor.

33:26.063 --> 33:27.565
And our job is to arrest them.

33:27.809 --> 33:28.961
Makes perfect sense to me.

33:29.284 --> 33:31.341
Justified or not, still a crime, Ziva.

33:32.132 --> 33:32.707
In this country,

33:32.731 --> 33:34.672
you cannot take the
law into your own hands.

33:34.908 --> 33:36.907
Unless it's your little
sister wanted for murder,

33:37.373 --> 33:37.845
right, Probie?

33:38.034 --> 33:39.034
You know what I mean.

33:39.993 --> 33:41.153
What if this was your sister?

33:42.057 --> 33:42.482
Or her?

33:42.988 --> 33:44.459
My point is that we cannot just

33:44.483 --> 33:46.261
investigate the crimes that we want to.

33:46.517 --> 33:47.517
McGee's right.

33:47.571 --> 33:49.105
Does anybody have a problem with that?

33:49.254 --> 33:50.479
No, boss, it's just...

33:50.873 --> 33:52.190
Just what, DiNozzo?

33:52.670 --> 33:54.587
Some days this job really sucks.

33:54.681 --> 33:56.377
Yeah? Well, it's about to get worse.

33:57.344 --> 34:00.032
Ziva, you and Tony are
with Sacks on this one.

34:00.071 --> 34:01.071
Doing what?

34:01.265 --> 34:03.807
Coming up with a list of
people who wanted Bright dead.

34:03.927 --> 34:05.127
Besides everyone in this room?

34:05.237 --> 34:06.912
Except for McLawyer over there.

34:06.975 --> 34:08.170
Tony, all I was saying...

34:08.195 --> 34:10.306
Go check on Abby, see
if she needs any help.

34:11.972 --> 34:14.007
Running a little late
today, are we, Tobias?

34:14.202 --> 34:15.492
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

34:15.516 --> 34:17.487
Oh, only slightly more than a lot.

34:17.753 --> 34:18.161
Come on.

34:18.601 --> 34:19.145
What?

34:19.389 --> 34:20.706
Ducky's got something for us.

34:21.328 --> 34:23.292
There wasn't any recoverable tissue

34:23.315 --> 34:24.590
from any of the remains.

34:24.893 --> 34:27.980
All four bodies were
completely stripped to the bone.

34:28.012 --> 34:29.710
Yeah, I can see that, Duck.

34:30.041 --> 34:31.360
How long were they on the ground?

34:31.484 --> 34:32.498
Shallow graves,

34:32.523 --> 34:33.915
exposed to the elements,

34:34.349 --> 34:36.543
all four women could
have been there for,

34:36.574 --> 34:39.806
ooh, decades or for as
little as six months.

34:39.835 --> 34:41.581
We know it's got to
be at least five years.

34:41.605 --> 34:43.286
Do we, Tobias?

34:43.945 --> 34:46.466
Yes, unless Bright figured out a way to

34:46.489 --> 34:48.126
climb in and out of that smokestack.

34:48.496 --> 34:50.154
For what it's worth, I agree with you,

34:50.178 --> 34:51.801
but down here, we deal in facts.

34:51.879 --> 34:52.879
Meaning you don't know?

34:53.283 --> 34:54.353
Well, not yet.

34:54.610 --> 34:56.274
Couldn't have told me
that on the phone, Duck?

34:56.297 --> 34:58.005
Yes, I could have, Jethro, but

34:58.029 --> 35:00.105
that's not the reason
I asked you down here.

35:01.558 --> 35:04.914
I took the liberty of
reviewing the profile

35:04.938 --> 35:06.720
that the FBI prepared

35:07.058 --> 35:09.614
on our serial killer eight years ago.

35:09.772 --> 35:12.318
In order to disguise
his predatory nature,

35:12.350 --> 35:14.642
Bright had to be methodical, precise,

35:14.989 --> 35:17.053
cautious almost to a fault.

35:17.588 --> 35:18.588
Your point?

35:19.049 --> 35:21.477
Well, if the FBI's finest
couldn't get to him,

35:22.138 --> 35:23.615
it makes me wonder who did.

35:23.998 --> 35:24.998
He knew his killer.

35:26.734 --> 35:27.877
That's good work, Ducky.

35:29.443 --> 35:31.799
How else could someone
get close enough to him

35:31.823 --> 35:34.330
to stab him to death
with a screwdriver?!

35:34.794 --> 35:35.907
- DiNozzo?
- Yeah, boss?

35:35.987 --> 35:37.447
Concentrate on the high school.

35:37.488 --> 35:38.343
Someone there had to have

35:38.367 --> 35:39.733
a personal connection to Bright.

35:39.828 --> 35:40.953
- On it.
- Find him.

35:42.618 --> 35:44.284
I'm a forensic scientist, McGee.

35:44.567 --> 35:46.033
I don't need anyone checking up on me.

35:46.057 --> 35:48.326
What I do need is to date those bones.

35:48.594 --> 35:50.857
The ones that we found
in Beef Jerky's backyard.

35:51.500 --> 35:52.500
"Marty"?

35:53.252 --> 35:54.252
Yes!

35:54.377 --> 35:55.457
Why didn't I think of that?

35:56.168 --> 35:59.788
Marty got his degree in
forensic botany at Penn State.

36:00.724 --> 36:02.720
The roots grew into the bones.

36:03.043 --> 36:04.944
So if Marty can I.D. the plant,

36:05.196 --> 36:06.978
he can probably give us a rough estimate

36:07.002 --> 36:08.273
as to when they were buried.

36:08.769 --> 36:10.169
Way to go, McGee!

36:14.440 --> 36:16.459
How did you know what Marty majored in?

36:17.582 --> 36:18.582
I didn't.

36:19.147 --> 36:19.885
Who is he?

36:20.040 --> 36:21.040
He's...

36:21.338 --> 36:22.353
just a friend.

36:24.551 --> 36:26.538
"Being with you makes me believe

36:26.562 --> 36:29.202
size truly doesn't matter. Abby."

36:30.395 --> 36:32.108
Okay, he's a really good friend.

36:36.072 --> 36:38.369
Where the hell did
you learn how to type?

36:38.495 --> 36:39.053
Do you mind?

36:39.155 --> 36:41.075
Your breath's taking the
starch out of my collar.

36:42.054 --> 36:42.754
- What've we got?
- What've we got?

36:43.064 --> 36:44.614
Um, the teaching staff still present

36:44.638 --> 36:47.035
from five years ago all claim
not to have known Bright.

36:47.074 --> 36:48.138
Well, if they murdered
the guy and stuffed

36:48.162 --> 36:50.015
him down a chimney,
that's not surprising.

36:50.067 --> 36:50.444
Tony?

36:50.832 --> 36:52.050
Running down a list of substitutes

36:52.074 --> 36:53.194
who used to teach back then.

36:53.223 --> 36:54.802
His wife's a teacher, third grade.

36:54.826 --> 36:56.146
See if she ever worked at Puller.

36:56.170 --> 36:58.386
We checked for Brights
already, boss. There are none.

36:58.803 --> 36:59.803
Check her maiden name.

36:59.887 --> 37:01.458
Her maiden name is Burris, Tony.

37:01.934 --> 37:03.405
Burris...

37:06.647 --> 37:08.385
Okay, got one hit: Karen Burris.

37:08.409 --> 37:11.262
Subbed for social studies
and Western history in 2001.

37:11.311 --> 37:12.672
Social security number listed

37:12.696 --> 37:14.127
is the same as Bright's wife.

37:24.636 --> 37:25.654
My mama always told me

37:25.678 --> 37:27.548
big things come in small packages.

37:28.162 --> 37:29.162
What a coincidence.

37:29.473 --> 37:31.757
Mine always warned me about
tattooed girls bearing...

37:31.937 --> 37:32.937
samples.

37:33.258 --> 37:34.767
I'm talking about your lab.

37:35.010 --> 37:36.010
I love it.

37:36.395 --> 37:37.395
Yeah?

37:37.524 --> 37:38.524
Pretty sweet, huh?

37:39.061 --> 37:40.257
Sweet!

37:40.902 --> 37:43.094
I'd kill for half this equipment.

37:43.275 --> 37:44.275
Really?

37:44.862 --> 37:46.142
What would you do for all of it?

37:50.242 --> 37:51.980
What's your crazy
ninja sense telling you?

37:52.385 --> 37:53.385
She's scared.

37:53.594 --> 37:55.590
I mean, about whether
she shanked Beef Jerky

37:55.614 --> 37:57.179
and dropped him down the wishing well.

37:58.081 --> 37:58.945
What would you do if

37:58.969 --> 38:00.652
you woke up one day and you discovered

38:00.762 --> 38:02.145
you were married to a monster?

38:02.414 --> 38:03.654
Happened to my father all the time.

38:03.678 --> 38:04.691
We usually just moved.

38:04.947 --> 38:06.299
Ah, that explains it.

38:15.305 --> 38:16.616
Karen, you were a substitute

38:16.640 --> 38:19.075
at Lieutenant General
Lewis Puller High School.

38:20.258 --> 38:22.697
I- I've worked a lot
of schools in the area.

38:23.239 --> 38:24.661
What does that have to do with this?

38:24.685 --> 38:26.599
Considering we found your husband

38:26.893 --> 38:28.361
petrified in the chimney there,

38:29.490 --> 38:30.490
quite a bit.

38:31.111 --> 38:32.111
Karen...

38:34.739 --> 38:36.095
we know this is hard...

38:39.371 --> 38:40.371
but we're here to help.

38:43.216 --> 38:45.839
It's important that
you tell us the truth.

38:51.237 --> 38:52.237
When'd you find out?

38:54.204 --> 38:55.204
Find out?

38:57.291 --> 38:58.910
That your loving husband

39:00.113 --> 39:01.411
was murdering women

39:02.471 --> 39:03.784
who looked just like you?

39:06.297 --> 39:07.335
I told you,

39:07.976 --> 39:09.888
my husband didn't do those things.

39:11.321 --> 39:13.288
He removed the toes
from their left feet.

39:15.173 --> 39:16.621
We think that you know why.

39:18.983 --> 39:20.002
You mind taking off your shoe

39:20.026 --> 39:21.328
and showing us your left foot?

39:23.108 --> 39:24.108
Please.

39:26.453 --> 39:27.453
Karen?

39:47.580 --> 39:49.223
Your husband was an evil man.

39:49.294 --> 39:51.068
That thing was not my husband.

39:53.520 --> 39:55.107
It wasn't the man I married.

39:55.773 --> 39:57.478
It had to be stopped, don't you see?

39:57.502 --> 39:58.808
I had no other choice!

39:59.136 --> 40:00.644
Yeah, you could have gone to the police.

40:00.668 --> 40:03.039
And have my children live
the rest of their lives

40:03.063 --> 40:05.552
knowing that monster
was their father? No!

40:06.779 --> 40:09.489
I had to. I had to protect them from it.

40:14.274 --> 40:15.800
Gaultheria procumbens

40:16.738 --> 40:17.548
evergreen shrub,

40:17.572 --> 40:19.982
more commonly known as
wintergreen or checkerberry.

40:21.204 --> 40:22.074
We need to see the photo where

40:22.098 --> 40:23.398
the sample was recovered from.

40:23.791 --> 40:26.432
It was taken from between
the fibula and the tibia.

40:26.786 --> 40:27.907
Go back to the wide shot.

40:29.319 --> 40:30.758
No..Go to that quadrant.

40:31.906 --> 40:32.906
That's your wintergreen,

40:33.096 --> 40:34.496
about five meters from the remains.

40:34.865 --> 40:36.535
Judging from the thickness of the root,

40:36.931 --> 40:38.117
annual growth rate

40:38.614 --> 40:40.242
and the soil samples you brought me,

40:41.193 --> 40:42.298
we can calculate roughly

40:42.322 --> 40:43.706
how long the body's been buried,

40:44.456 --> 40:45.745
plus or minus six months.

40:46.855 --> 40:48.324
You can tell it was a live sample

40:48.415 --> 40:50.782
by the tiny little offshoots
forming off the main root.

40:51.493 --> 40:52.493
Want to see?

40:56.245 --> 40:57.245
Abby?

40:58.017 --> 40:59.238
In her position, I can't say

40:59.262 --> 41:00.902
I wouldn't have done
the same thing, Tony.

41:02.123 --> 41:03.123
McGee was right,

41:03.559 --> 41:05.417
about taking the law
into your own hands.

41:06.974 --> 41:09.177
She's lucky she wasn't his last victim.

41:20.170 --> 41:21.170
Karen...

41:21.486 --> 41:24.352
no one should have to
live through what you did.

41:25.001 --> 41:26.430
Believe me when I tell you that...

41:27.115 --> 41:28.692
there's no jury in the world

41:28.906 --> 41:30.291
that wouldn't sympathize with you.

41:35.270 --> 41:36.270
It's not me.

41:43.898 --> 41:44.898
What?

41:44.981 --> 41:46.501
What do you want to bet that's McGeek?

41:46.725 --> 41:47.639
Rule number 22:

41:47.663 --> 41:50.264
Never, ever bother
Gibbs in interrogation.

41:56.791 --> 41:58.207
Tony, I don't think it's McGee.

41:59.536 --> 42:00.747
Got it, Abbs, thanks.

42:03.323 --> 42:04.323
You okay, Karen?

42:04.364 --> 42:05.564
You're gonna get through this.

42:06.170 --> 42:07.436
Get away from her, Tobias.

42:13.810 --> 42:16.477
The bodies in the yard are
not from five years ago.

42:16.746 --> 42:17.746
They're older?

42:18.296 --> 42:19.296
No.

42:20.694 --> 42:21.894
They're more recent than that.

42:25.576 --> 42:27.259
Her husband wasn't the serial killer.

42:31.127 --> 42:32.127
She is.

42:41.493 --> 42:43.291
I got to tell you, Jethro, that was...

42:47.149 --> 42:48.150
that was...

42:51.434 --> 42:53.255
How in God's name could
we have missed that?

42:55.217 --> 42:57.360
I don't think God had
much to do with it, Tobias.

42:57.413 --> 42:59.053
You know what's really
got me freaked out?

42:59.475 --> 43:01.088
If her husband's body
hadn't gotten hung up

43:01.112 --> 43:02.806
going down that chimney five years ago,

43:03.831 --> 43:04.925
she'd still be out there.

43:06.513 --> 43:07.593
We'd never have caught her.

43:09.776 --> 43:11.136
I can do you one better than that.

43:11.754 --> 43:13.682
No, can't top that, Jethro.

43:14.409 --> 43:16.808
What was a toe doing in
her husband's stomach?
