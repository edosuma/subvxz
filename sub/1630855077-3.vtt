00:39.520 --> 00:40.880
Thank you.
No!

00:40.880 --> 00:43.320
Yes, it's kismet.
- Congratulations.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.560
Cheers!

00:45.560 --> 00:48.000
- It's got to be at Hartley, right?
Obviously.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.160
We've not really decided on anything yet.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.600
- Well, the engagement party at least?
- The what?

00:53.120 --> 00:55.920
- Mum, let's not freak her out too much.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.880
Sorry, this family can get a bit intense.

00:57.880 --> 01:03.080
Oh, speaking of intense, your auntie Ellen
sent me a video message. Let me show you.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.520
Let's see.
Oh no.

01:04.520 --> 01:06.000
She's adorable.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.240
She's not though.
Have a look at this.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.880
<i>So excited to hear your news.</i>

01:09.880 --> 01:12.960
<i>I can't wait to see you
and give you a big old hug.</i>

01:12.960 --> 01:14.720
- Excuse me.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.320
- It's not upside down.
<i>-</i> The Botox looks great.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.760
<i>Maybe meet in London
next time I'm down.</i>

01:19.760 --> 01:22.960
Yeah, she has had a bit.
Too much in her upper.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.800
She's had a bit of work done?
<i>-</i> Yeah.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.600
Has she?
No.

01:26.600 --> 01:27.560
Looks natural.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.920
Anna. What are you do--

01:39.040 --> 01:41.240
What happened in Paris was a one-off.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.880
This all falls apart
if we don't stick to the rules.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.520
- I need to tell you--
- Wait.

01:49.920 --> 01:50.760
Please.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.400
There is no version of this with just you.

02:08.480 --> 02:09.360
Or just him?

02:13.560 --> 02:15.920
I love everything
about what we have.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.920
I don't want to lose it.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.480
Are you able to control yourself?

02:36.000 --> 02:36.840
Yeah.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.040
Good.

02:41.960 --> 02:42.880
Hold on.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.200
I've been getting messages.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.560
I don't know who they're from,
but... they know.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.280
About us.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.960
I haven't responded.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.680
When did they start?

03:02.680 --> 03:05.560
Uh, the night Jay proposed.

03:12.640 --> 03:13.480
Anna.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.080
I'll handle it.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.960
When we're with your family, watch me.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.280
If I touch my hair,

03:27.520 --> 03:31.080
it means I'm thinking about what we'll do
the next time we're together.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.080
When?

03:35.120 --> 03:35.960
Hmm.

03:36.840 --> 03:37.920
Soon.

04:13.440 --> 04:17.240
Actually, can we make a quick stop
at Bexley Avenue? It's not too far.

04:18.960 --> 04:19.800
Anna?

04:20.840 --> 04:23.000
Um... a friend.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.520
I'd like to see her.
Tell her the wonderful news.

04:27.280 --> 04:28.120
Really?

04:30.120 --> 04:30.960
Who?

04:30.960 --> 04:32.720
Hmm. A childhood friend.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.080
Peggy.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.120
First I've heard of her.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.440
I'm excited to meet her.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.600
Not tonight, if you don't mind.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.760
What's going on?

05:03.280 --> 05:04.760
You need to stop texting him.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.840
- What?
You think you're helping.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.920
- But you're not.
- I don't know what you're talking--

05:08.920 --> 05:12.760
You've been texting William, threatening
to tell his wife. You need to stop.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.040
Oh fuck.

05:21.120 --> 05:21.960
Yeah.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.200
- Someone else knows.
- You know.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.720
Why would you think it's me?

05:35.000 --> 05:39.080
I have never involved myself
in your love life. Why would I start now?

05:48.800 --> 05:49.920
So, who is it?

05:54.680 --> 05:55.640
Jay proposed.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.600
And what did you say?

06:03.520 --> 06:04.360
Yes.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.600
This is him, isn't it?

06:16.400 --> 06:18.440
- I'll go down.
- I want to meet him.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.240
Hello.
-<i>It's Jay.</i>

06:25.240 --> 06:27.320
Come up.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.960
I just want to say hello.

06:35.720 --> 06:36.680
Top floor.

06:59.800 --> 07:00.720
Hey.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.000
- You must be the mysterious Peggy.
I am.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.320
Now I get it.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.520
Get what?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.840
Why I'm marrying you.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.320
I'm sorry you came all the way up.
I was just coming down.

07:23.840 --> 07:24.760
We need to go.

07:25.760 --> 07:26.960
That's a shame.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.720
- Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

07:37.840 --> 07:40.400
I came up
because I want to meet your friend.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.240
Because I love you,
and we're getting married,

07:43.240 --> 07:46.280
and I want the people in your life
to be in mine. Anna!

07:49.280 --> 07:51.040
I haven't even met your mum.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.280
You will. I promise.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.840
You'll meet her at the engagement party.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.120
Good.

08:55.960 --> 08:56.840
Yeah?

08:56.840 --> 09:00.440
Look, I know you can't talk,
but I need to know if I should be worried.

09:03.480 --> 09:07.280
You've done some really fucked-up things
in the past, and this just feels--

09:07.280 --> 09:08.200
<i>I'm fine.</i>

09:08.200 --> 09:10.760
Well, I don't know how you can be.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.320
What are you trying to achieve?

09:13.320 --> 09:15.240
<i>I have it all under control.</i>

09:19.560 --> 09:21.560
Has your mum met Jay yet?

09:25.760 --> 09:28.320
- No.
<i>I'll be at the engagement party.</i>

09:30.400 --> 09:32.400
When she sees him, you'll need me.

09:36.920 --> 09:37.920
Night, Peggy.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.640
- It's not Peggy.
- I can't bear this, Anna.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.080
- What if they tell Ingrid?
Any idea who it might be?

09:55.080 --> 09:58.520
I've been so careful.
- Any friends you've spoken to?

09:58.520 --> 10:00.840
There's a woman at work.
A colleague.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.560
I don't think she likes me much.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.360
She may have found out about us,
but I don't think she's capable of this.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.720
Invite her to the engagement party.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.920
- What? Wait, no. Anna.
- Give me your phone.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.320
What are you doing?

10:19.640 --> 10:20.480
Surviving.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.760
- Really happy for you.
- You met Anna?

11:02.760 --> 11:04.360
Nice to meet you. I'm Joan.

11:13.680 --> 11:14.800
Thank you.
- Sir.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.880
Thank you.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.920
Dutch courage.
They're a bunch of bloody animals.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.440
Yeah, well, so am I.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.440
Jay.
Evening.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.680
Who invited you?

11:25.680 --> 11:28.040
Congratulations.
Thank you.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.520
Congratulations.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.520
Thank you.

11:32.880 --> 11:33.720
Thank you.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.120
Jay's fiancée? I'm Nadia.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.560
How lovely of you to come all this way.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.720
Well, William and I have worked together
for a long time now.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.640
Oh. You must be close, then?

12:09.120 --> 12:13.880
Well, I have a lot of respect for William.
He's one of the best we've got.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.320
That's not what I asked.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.680
Right.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.160
I can't say I've managed
to get past the small talk yet.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.880
You're not alone,
put it that way.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.920
Well, you're here.
Perhaps it's the start of him opening up.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.160
Don't hold your breath.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.680
It's great to meet you.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.840
There you are.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.960
- You made it.
'Course I did.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.320
It's not Nadia.

12:57.680 --> 12:58.640
How do you know?

12:59.400 --> 13:03.360
She has her opinions about you,
but she doesn't know about us. Trust me.

13:06.480 --> 13:07.560
I got another one.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.320
What did it say?

13:11.880 --> 13:13.800
"If you don't tell her, I will."

13:19.920 --> 13:20.840
Thank you.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.960
I need you to pull it together.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.360
You came.

13:41.880 --> 13:42.840
Of course I did.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.320
This is my mother, Elizabeth.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.880
Jay's father?
- So glad you could join us.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.640
It's lovely to finally meet.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.080
Oh.

13:59.760 --> 14:04.000
I don't know about you, but it's all felt
rather clandestine from my end.

14:07.160 --> 14:09.800
Where's this mysterious fiancé of yours?

14:16.080 --> 14:19.640
Jay. Jay, meet Elizabeth.
Mum, this is Jay.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.240
It's a pleasure.
I'm so glad to finally meet you.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.520
Anna, why didn't you tell me?

14:26.400 --> 14:27.280
Tell you what?

14:29.560 --> 14:32.640
I suppose it's not that strong
a resemblance, really. Just...

14:34.120 --> 14:38.040
You look so very much
like my late son, Aston.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.880
- Anna's brother.
- No, he doesn't.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.800
Anna, his eyes...
- Mum!

14:45.800 --> 14:49.400
This is so inappropriate.
Honestly, you don't. Mum!

14:49.400 --> 14:50.320
It's just, um,

14:51.640 --> 14:53.920
an impression, that's all.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.240
You're very handsome.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.680
Well, thank you, I suppose.

14:58.240 --> 15:00.640
Oh, Mum! You'll have to meet
my mother now.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.200
This is Elizabeth.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.440
Oh, Elizabeth.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.280
I'll keep an eye on her.

15:45.560 --> 15:46.760
Can I have one?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.360
You smoke?

15:49.280 --> 15:50.120
No.

15:59.560 --> 16:02.200
Look, I'm so sorry to do this,

16:02.200 --> 16:05.360
but would you hate me
if I fucked off after the fireworks?

16:05.360 --> 16:07.000
Oh. Take me with you.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.160
Are you all right?

16:13.160 --> 16:14.000
No.

16:14.520 --> 16:15.360
Sorry.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.280
What's going on?

16:20.760 --> 16:21.760
Kelly dumped me.

16:22.880 --> 16:23.720
Yesterday.

16:26.760 --> 16:27.720
I'm sorry.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.280
Yeah, well, I think there's someone else.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.960
I don't want to bring a downer
on all this. I... I don't. It's your night.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.520
- It's your mum's night, really.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.000
My brother really loves you, you know?

16:54.560 --> 16:55.520
That's so rare.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.640
Where's Anna? Where's Anna?

17:09.640 --> 17:12.560
And Sally as well. Come on.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.360
Where's Sally?

17:14.960 --> 17:16.520
Can I have your attention, everyone.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.600
I just want to say a few words.

17:18.600 --> 17:20.400
- Jay, where's Anna?
- Anna, come on.

17:22.640 --> 17:23.520
Dad!

17:25.000 --> 17:29.280
Thank you so much, everyone,
for coming. You all look divine.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.160
Yay!
Um...

17:31.160 --> 17:32.880
I'm afraid you've just got me.

17:32.880 --> 17:36.200
Uh, my husband is saving himself
for the wedding.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.120
Clearly only does the headline acts.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.760
- Yep, he's the main attraction. Exactly.

17:40.760 --> 17:44.040
He's not funny at all though.

17:44.040 --> 17:47.720
No, but seriously, we're here
to talk about marriage, aren't we?

17:47.720 --> 17:50.200
- Jay and Anna.
- Here we go.

17:52.880 --> 17:58.840
Now, as we know, marriage is about trust.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.080
And

18:04.240 --> 18:06.280
I have a confession to make, William.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.760
I've been spying on you.

18:11.920 --> 18:15.120
The other day, I went to your work,
and you weren't there.

18:21.040 --> 18:24.720
And the wonderful Nadia
let me wait in your office.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.720
But you didn't materialize.

18:30.960 --> 18:35.640
Now, what is a wife to do
when she's alone in her husband's office?

18:37.200 --> 18:38.200
She rifles.

18:43.480 --> 18:45.400
And what I found, well...

18:55.040 --> 19:00.000
I found a set
of four grainy passport photos

19:00.000 --> 19:02.440
of William and I in our early days.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.680
We found a photo booth, and we said,

19:09.880 --> 19:12.000
"When we're old...

19:12.000 --> 19:14.080
...and we've got kids and a mortgage,

19:15.160 --> 19:16.760
we will look at these,

19:17.880 --> 19:19.640
and we will remember

19:20.960 --> 19:24.440
the love that we felt right then."

19:37.520 --> 19:39.760
Well, I don't need to be reminded of that

19:39.760 --> 19:42.400
because the fact
that you held onto them for so long

19:42.400 --> 19:44.320
shows me that it's still there.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.080
Which... which brings me to say,

19:49.840 --> 19:51.320
to Jay and Anna...

19:53.120 --> 19:58.880
...if... if you nourish and protect
the foundation of your love,

19:58.880 --> 20:01.320
it will last you for years to come.

20:02.760 --> 20:06.000
And we are both so excited for you.
William and I both are.

20:07.880 --> 20:12.320
Please raise your glasses
for a toast to Jay and Anna.

20:12.320 --> 20:13.680
To Jay and Anna!

20:16.080 --> 20:18.440
Enjoy the fireworks, everyone!

20:27.240 --> 20:29.480
I hope it wasn't too cheesy.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.040
No. No, it was wonderful.

20:52.440 --> 20:53.880
Hmm. May I?

20:53.880 --> 20:56.040
Um, I'm fine. Thank you, Elizabeth.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.480
You really should be more careful.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.560
What did you say to him?

21:29.120 --> 21:30.960
I saw the way he was looking at you.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.200
- Mum!
It's not proper, is it?

21:35.880 --> 21:37.560
Please tell me it's nothing.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.720
I need you to drop it.

21:46.120 --> 21:48.240
Of course, my darling.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.000
I'm sure you have
everything under control.

22:29.320 --> 22:30.160
I love you.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.360
And I love you, Anna.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.920
Mum hasn't scared you off, has she?

22:51.120 --> 22:51.960
Oh no.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.360
I'm just

22:55.520 --> 22:57.240
learning to love the questions.

23:09.240 --> 23:11.040
You know you can tell me about him.

23:17.520 --> 23:21.600
All you need to know is that I've never
felt that close to anyone until I met you.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.960
They were bluffing.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.960
You're not worried about who it was?

24:14.240 --> 24:15.080
No.

24:21.120 --> 24:24.040
What your mum said about Jay.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.600
Is that true?

24:33.520 --> 24:34.600
I can't deal

24:36.240 --> 24:40.120
with the idea of you needing him
more than you need me.

24:42.880 --> 24:46.080
Even if he does look like Aston,
that's where it ends.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.280
He's nothing like him.

24:50.520 --> 24:53.040
He's not cruel.
He doesn't need to possess me.

24:56.360 --> 24:57.840
What did Aston do to you?

25:03.680 --> 25:05.600
What happened the night that he died?

25:09.960 --> 25:11.480
I finally said no to him.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.280
He came into my bed.

25:19.880 --> 25:21.080
I said no, and...

25:23.200 --> 25:24.680
he destroyed himself.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.800
Stop. Stop it.

25:42.760 --> 25:43.880
I don't want pity.

26:24.440 --> 26:25.720
Hurt me.

26:45.640 --> 26:46.520
Thank you.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.000
How does it look?

27:03.840 --> 27:05.440
Like a bridesmaid's dress.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.160
Smashed it.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.040
What's wrong?

27:18.160 --> 27:20.720
I don't really know
who else to talk to about this.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
What is it?

27:26.840 --> 27:27.680
It's Dad.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.240
I think he's having an affair.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.680
Uh, I've been sending these texts.

27:36.680 --> 27:40.320
God, it sounds so stupid,
but I was trying to get him to end it.

27:41.080 --> 27:42.200
I had to stop.

27:42.800 --> 27:47.080
After we spoke at the party, I couldn't be
the one to fuck up my parents' marriage.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.360
How can you be sure?

27:53.360 --> 27:54.640
I found something.

28:07.000 --> 28:07.840
Look.

28:18.520 --> 28:19.840
Where did you find it?

28:20.680 --> 28:21.520
Um,

28:21.520 --> 28:23.760
he'd just come back from Brussels.

28:23.760 --> 28:25.880
I... I wore his coat to go to the shop.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.040
It was in the pocket.

28:29.080 --> 28:31.120
It... it... it's seriously fucked up.

28:32.040 --> 28:35.600
Like, what was he doing over there?
It can't have just been a work trip.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.680
It was me.

28:42.440 --> 28:44.080
The handwriting. It's mine.

28:46.480 --> 28:49.920
I'm sorry if you think that's fucked up,
but it's me. It's...

28:51.840 --> 28:54.840
I... I write things down
so I can process them.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.720
I don't know how else to.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.080
B... but why did Dad have it?

29:07.600 --> 29:10.320
He found it at Hartley, and

29:11.720 --> 29:14.680
he said he'd look after it
until he could get it back to me.

29:14.680 --> 29:18.920
I've been paralyzed by the idea
that he'd read it, and now you have too.

29:20.680 --> 29:21.960
I... I'm so sorry.

29:22.720 --> 29:23.560
I thought...

29:23.560 --> 29:26.640
I hope you understand
that what you've discovered,

29:26.640 --> 29:28.560
it doesn't change my love for Jay.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.520
Please, you have nothing to explain.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.080
I feel so embarrassed.

29:33.080 --> 29:35.160
Don't be. Fucking hell.

29:36.840 --> 29:37.680
Thank you.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.560
Let's go get a drink. Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:40.560 --> 29:43.880
- I need to get out of this sodding dress.

30:07.560 --> 30:08.760
Sally had it.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.720
She was the one sending the messages.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.760
- So... so does she--
No.

30:14.320 --> 30:15.760
No, she doesn't.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.400
Why did you need to take it?

30:22.800 --> 30:23.720
I'm yours.

30:23.720 --> 30:24.640
Are you?

30:27.880 --> 30:30.040
You're on every single page.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.400
What did you write for today?

31:28.880 --> 31:30.680
Hi. How are you?
Well. You?

31:30.680 --> 31:32.320
Good. Thanks for seeing me.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.960
Pleasure. Would you like
to come through, have a coffee?

31:34.960 --> 31:36.040
Yeah.
- Great.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.400
Anna's not a great one for reminiscing,

31:39.400 --> 31:43.920
so what I know about her life before me
is full of gaps, which is fine, of course.

31:43.920 --> 31:47.160
But it does make writing
a decent speech about her a bit tricky.

31:47.160 --> 31:50.680
Right.
So, you'd... you'd like some anecdotes?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.800
- Something like that.
Mm.

31:59.720 --> 32:00.760
Does she love me?

32:07.400 --> 32:08.480
Well, I...

32:10.960 --> 32:13.640
I think that's something
only Anna can answer.

32:19.080 --> 32:21.800
- I shouldn't have asked.
No, you shouldn't, but...

32:24.960 --> 32:26.040
Look, Jay...

32:29.320 --> 32:31.240
Anna will never be ordinary.

32:34.920 --> 32:38.280
I mean, that's probably
why you love her, actually.

32:38.280 --> 32:40.440
But, uh, it... it... it means that...

32:41.040 --> 32:42.960
it means that your relationship,

32:43.800 --> 32:47.280
her love for you,
will never be ordinary either.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.720
And I... I wouldn't blame you if you...

32:52.520 --> 32:54.800
if you decide
that you can't deal with that.

32:55.960 --> 32:57.720
And if so, you can still walk away.

32:58.720 --> 33:02.480
But, no... but... but...
but if you're going to be with Anna,

33:04.000 --> 33:05.120
going to marry her,

33:07.120 --> 33:08.080
then trust me,

33:09.680 --> 33:11.840
don't go looking
where she tells you not to.

35:22.280 --> 35:23.840
Nothing you need to know about.

35:25.240 --> 35:26.280
What does that mean?

35:28.720 --> 35:29.560
I'm joking.

35:35.720 --> 35:36.560
What's wrong?

35:40.800 --> 35:42.240
Sorry.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.560
It's nothing. I'm fine.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.040
You're everything to me, Anna.

36:01.240 --> 36:03.120
I've never loved anyone before you.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.320
I want you to know that.

36:10.320 --> 36:11.520
I love you too.

36:13.760 --> 36:16.160
Enjoy your stag. If they let you.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.920
Oh, here he is.
Shots for the lucky man!

36:41.920 --> 36:43.880
Yes!
Yeah, let's go.

36:43.880 --> 36:45.720
Let's get 'em down. Here you go.

36:46.400 --> 36:47.360
One more.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.680
I'll tell you what, he is a lucky man.

36:49.680 --> 36:50.800
Jay!

36:50.800 --> 36:52.040
Oh, Dad!

36:52.560 --> 36:54.280
Made it!

36:54.280 --> 36:55.200
Ah...

36:56.200 --> 36:58.760
Come and have a drink.
How are you?

36:58.760 --> 37:00.240
- Shot, William?
- Oh, no.

37:00.240 --> 37:02.240
Come on. It's your son's stag.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.000
- Really?
Yeah, you have to.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.920
That's right. Come on.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.880
Nice.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.920
So, any words of wisdom for him
before he ties the knot?

37:11.920 --> 37:14.000
A few honeymoon tips
from Dad, maybe?

37:14.000 --> 37:16.880
I don't think anybody
needs my opinion on all that.

37:16.880 --> 37:19.200
- Aw, he's blushing!
- Blushing? Am I blushing?

37:19.200 --> 37:21.080
Yeah.
- Boys, boys, boys.

37:21.880 --> 37:22.720
To Jay and Anna.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.280
To Jay and Anna!

37:29.360 --> 37:31.120
- I'll get this.
Thanks.

37:33.520 --> 37:34.400
Having fun?

37:35.120 --> 37:37.000
To be honest, I'm a bit nervous, Dad.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.280
Of course you are.
It's a big deal.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.960
Are you having second thoughts?

37:50.160 --> 37:51.680
It's just...

37:52.520 --> 37:55.200
Anna's always holding
something back, you know?

37:56.800 --> 37:58.160
She's very complicated.

38:02.840 --> 38:03.680
Go on.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.840
She didn't think
I could handle it in the beginning.

38:09.000 --> 38:09.840
And can you?

38:12.520 --> 38:13.520
I think so.

38:20.320 --> 38:22.080
Marriage isn't gonna be easy.

38:25.600 --> 38:30.680
I think Anna's gonna challenge you
in ways that you're not prepared for.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.600
What are you talking about?

38:36.520 --> 38:39.280
- I just want you to be happy.
- Now you're worrying me.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.200
- What's going on?
Nothing.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.680
It's just a big deal for me, you know?

38:46.640 --> 38:49.360
Seeing my son begin
the next phase of his life.

38:50.880 --> 38:52.760
- I'm doing this all wrong, aren't I?
No.

38:52.760 --> 38:57.200
It's... it's probably me. I'm just...
I'm struggling to understand. Um...

39:01.360 --> 39:02.320
You know...

39:04.280 --> 39:06.480
none of us really know
what's gonna happen.

39:08.160 --> 39:11.280
Maybe we just all need to learn
to love the questions.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.040
Where'd you hear that?

39:20.520 --> 39:22.000
It's from a poem, isn't it?

39:24.080 --> 39:26.880
I'm gonna go. You have fun.
