WEBVTT

00:05.673 --> 00:07.339
Greg, you're cooking.

00:07.408 --> 00:08.674
Don't do something nice for me

00:08.742 --> 00:10.042
that will take me an hour to clean up.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.044
No, I'm researching
a historical dish to drop off

00:12.112 --> 00:15.047
with my application for the
Westport Historical Guild.

00:15.115 --> 00:16.415
Colonial onion pie?

00:16.483 --> 00:17.583
It's an homage to Westport's past

00:17.651 --> 00:19.218
as a leading onion producer in America.

00:19.286 --> 00:21.220
I think it'll help my application
stand out from the crowd.

00:21.288 --> 00:22.788
Crowd? What crowd?

00:22.856 --> 00:24.723
It's eight guys talking about
preserving dirt roads.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.158
I'm aware the stakes are high.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.427
You don't need to make me any
more nervous than I already am.

00:28.495 --> 00:29.561
Okay.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.597
My apologies for being late.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.232
But you have to dress
for the life you want,

00:33.300 --> 00:34.399
not the life you have.

00:34.468 --> 00:35.534
Where did you get the money to buy

00:35.603 --> 00:37.603
that ridiculously expensive shirt?

00:37.671 --> 00:39.204
I dipped into my save jar.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.073
And who are you dressing up for, Oliver?

00:41.141 --> 00:42.574
Your girlfriend?

00:42.643 --> 00:44.076
Her I have to answer.

00:44.144 --> 00:45.744
You I owe nothing.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.082
I'm finished. Can I go play?

00:50.150 --> 00:51.583
Sweetie, you didn't wash
your hands four times.

00:51.652 --> 00:52.684
Is something wrong?

00:52.753 --> 00:55.420
Nope. I just don't feel like it today.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.358
She just doesn't feel like it today.

00:59.426 --> 01:00.659
Yeah, but she could wash them once.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.060
Her hands are covered in egg.

01:02.129 --> 01:04.763
Ah, Dr. Ellie's really helping
Anna-Kat with her OCD.

01:04.831 --> 01:06.898
She might be on her way
to becoming a typical kid.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.043 --> 01:17.576
Well, two steps forward,
four steps back.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.578
But still, it's a victory.
We should celebrate.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.079
Let's go out tonight
for dinner and drinks.

01:21.148 --> 01:23.048
That sounds so tiring.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.083
Agreed. I regretted it
the moment I said it.

01:25.152 --> 01:26.485
Yeah.

01:26.553 --> 01:29.421

01:32.826 --> 01:35.127
What are you doing?
We have to pay for those.

01:35.195 --> 01:37.929
Greg, you're always taking
the high road.

01:37.998 --> 01:40.132
We're paying for them
by buying all this other stuff.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.922
- It's part of the deal.
- It's stealing.

01:41.947 --> 01:43.393
- Or sampling.
- Or stealing.

01:43.503 --> 01:45.303
Look, we could go 'round
and 'round about this for hours.

01:45.372 --> 01:47.439
Let's just agree that it's
sampling and call it a day.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.341
Oh, onions.

01:49.409 --> 01:50.709
Recipe calls for two bushels.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.377
Mm.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.713
Mama, Dad, Penny just invited me

01:54.781 --> 01:56.481
to her house for a playdate.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.983
Can I go?

01:58.885 --> 02:01.853
Well, Penny, depends on where you live.

02:01.922 --> 02:04.322
Is your house a castle?

02:04.391 --> 02:07.025
Mama, don't be weird.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.627
Penny's in the grade above me.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.061
She's right over there.

02:12.032 --> 02:14.566
Oh. Sure.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.737
First, she skips
her hand-washing routine.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.138
Now she's telling me I'm weird.

02:20.207 --> 02:21.539
This is typical kid stuff.

02:21.608 --> 02:23.742
Except for the hygiene part,
this is wildly encouraging.

02:23.810 --> 02:24.843
Right?!

02:25.846 --> 02:26.911
Katie.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.080
Sampling.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.720
She didn't even wash her hands
after she used the bathroom.

02:35.789 --> 02:36.888
We couldn't be happier.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.490
Low bar in the Otto household.

02:38.558 --> 02:40.302
And she made a playdate
with a second-grader.

02:40.461 --> 02:41.660
A human second-grader?

02:41.728 --> 02:43.195
- Mm-hmm.
- Who's the other mom?

02:43.263 --> 02:45.130
Chloe Brown Mueller.

02:47.534 --> 02:51.470
You're going on a playdate
at Chloe Brown Mueller's house?

02:51.538 --> 02:53.171
- Yeah.
- Wait a minute. Hold up.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.775
Chloe Brown Mueller?

02:54.842 --> 02:57.008
Why do you guys insist
on saying her full name?

02:57.077 --> 02:58.076
Because...

02:58.145 --> 02:59.578
She's Chloe Brown Mueller.

02:59.646 --> 03:00.812
When you meet her, you'll understand.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.080
She's a local celebrity.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.982
She has thousands
of Instagram followers,

03:04.051 --> 03:06.385
and all of her posts are about
what a perfect mommy she is.

03:06.453 --> 03:09.221
How do you not know and despise
Chloe Brown Mueller already?

03:09.289 --> 03:10.756
I'm not big into social media,

03:10.824 --> 03:12.557
and I actively avoid people
with three names.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.426
Plus, I've never seen her at drop-off.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.561
That's because her housekeeper
brings Penny to school.

03:16.630 --> 03:17.796
That is terrible mothering.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.431
My housekeeper brings my kids to school.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.665
Yeah, but I'm friends with you.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.701
In a town full of gossips,
she's the worst.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.536
She texted everyone about my divorce

03:24.605 --> 03:25.771
before I even knew about it...

03:25.839 --> 03:28.273
and implied that it was my fault.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.742
It was your fault.
You cheated multiple times.

03:30.811 --> 03:31.977
That's on her.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.478
All of her friends
are just so attractive.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.113
So she's a little gossipy.

03:35.182 --> 03:36.248
I can handle that.

03:36.316 --> 03:37.883
She's also super judgmental.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.252
She mommy-shamed me once
by Instagraming my dirty car.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.653
Ugh!

03:41.722 --> 03:43.321
I've been waiting
for the perfect opportunity

03:43.390 --> 03:45.390
to mommy-shame her back,
but the best that I found

03:45.459 --> 03:47.559
was that she doesn't recycle
her yogurt containers.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.261
The way to deal with Chloe Brown Mueller

03:49.329 --> 03:51.229
is to shut up, get in, get out.

03:51.298 --> 03:53.832
Mm-hmm. Hang on, back up.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.267
You went through her garbage?

03:55.335 --> 03:58.103
Mm-hmm, I made a huge mess so
she would think it was raccoons.

03:58.172 --> 03:59.438
I even tore some stuff with my teeth.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.445
Uh-huh. Uh-huh, totally.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.280
Hang on one sec.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.616
And I'm back.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.386
I totally agree, but the thing is...

04:14.455 --> 04:16.087
Hang on one sec.

04:16.156 --> 04:18.957
I'm sorry. There's like zero
privacy in this house.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.291
Hang on one sec.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.560
Who the hell are you talking to?

04:21.628 --> 04:23.261
Who I talk to is none of your business.

04:23.330 --> 04:25.263
You really do have
a girlfriend, don't you?

04:25.332 --> 04:27.766
Taylor, I swear on my robust IRA

04:27.835 --> 04:29.234
that I do not have a girlfriend.

04:29.303 --> 04:30.902
Fine, don't tell me the truth.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.204
I'll find out by myself.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.572
You're not going to find anything.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.474
You couldn't even find
your way home yesterday.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.676
I left school from the soccer field.

04:37.744 --> 04:38.777
I was all confused.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.414
Important family announcement.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.182
Stay the hell away from the minivan.

04:44.251 --> 04:45.584
I just got it washed.

04:45.652 --> 04:47.486
I thought you said the only way
you'd wash that car

04:47.554 --> 04:49.120
is if you drove us all into a lake.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.489
That is true.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.858
But Anna-Kat has a playdate at the house

04:52.926 --> 04:54.493
of Westport's most judgy mom.

04:54.561 --> 04:58.263
I'm not risking her social life
by having a dusty whip.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.364
Nice slang, Mom.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.298
Yeah, girl.

05:00.367 --> 05:01.500
And you ruined it.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.804
These pies... They look like pies.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.873
- I did it!
- Great job, Greg.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.207
And you didn't even hurt yourself.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.610
Actually, I sustained some burns
that aren't visible,

05:11.678 --> 05:13.044
but it'll all be worth it.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.613
Can I get you to taste one
and tell me what you think?

05:14.681 --> 05:16.581
I'd be happy to.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.486
Ugh!

05:21.555 --> 05:25.357
That... is the worst thing
I have ever smelled.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.292
I'm turtling up.

05:27.361 --> 05:28.560
- Ohh.
- It's perfect.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.495
- I was going for historical accuracy.
- Ugh!

05:30.564 --> 05:32.165
Colonial onion pie
is supposed to be awful.

05:32.228 --> 05:33.332
Ugh!

05:33.333 --> 05:34.611
- Come on, Anna-Kat.
- Oh, God.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.009
It's time for you playdate.

05:36.034 --> 05:37.096
- Ohh! Greg,
- Oh!

05:37.120 --> 05:38.905
you've given our house permanent B.O.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.172
Put it outside and Febreze
the hell out of this place

05:41.241 --> 05:42.374
while I'm gone.

05:42.442 --> 05:44.142
- Ugh.
- I...

05:48.782 --> 05:50.982
Remember to say "please,"
"excuse me," and "thank you."

05:51.051 --> 05:52.684
And don't use any of the words
Mama screams

05:52.753 --> 05:54.319
while she's driving.

05:55.289 --> 05:57.422
Mama, come here.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.159
I got this.

06:11.505 --> 06:12.871
Oh, Anna-Kat.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.005
Roberta.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.640
I'm so glad you and Penny

06:15.709 --> 06:17.576
finally get to play ponies together.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.644
Come on, I'll show you to her room.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.980
Katie. Chloe Brown Mueller.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.349
So nice to meet you.

06:24.418 --> 06:25.984
Did you...

06:26.053 --> 06:27.586
Did we just take a picture together?

06:27.654 --> 06:29.955
Your daughter is adorable.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.524
So much better than the last
girl Penny brought over.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.793
I gave that playdate
one and a half stars.

06:34.861 --> 06:36.695
Snooze.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.630
<i>I'm just going to smile and nod</i>

06:38.699 --> 06:40.265
<i>because I can't tell if she's kidding.</i>

06:40.334 --> 06:42.968
Hey, would you like to come in
for a glass of Sancerre?

06:43.036 --> 06:45.503
Chloe, I'd love to learn what that is.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.205
But I got some errands to run.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.174
I'll be back in two to pick up Anna-Kat.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.842
Hey, how is your friend Angela doing?

06:50.911 --> 06:52.110
I hear she's dating again.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.545
Is that true?

06:57.117 --> 06:59.117
All right, I'm just gonna say it true.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.559
Oh, hey. How'd the playdate go?

07:07.628 --> 07:08.994
It went awesome.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.629
Aw, that's great, sweetie.

07:11.832 --> 07:12.931
Yay!

07:15.469 --> 07:17.302
Okay, how'd it really go?
Awkward? A disaster?

07:17.371 --> 07:18.336
An awkward disaster?

07:18.405 --> 07:19.771
The playdate went so well

07:19.840 --> 07:22.507
with Chloe Brown Mueller
that she even posted about it.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.243
She gave it four stars.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.978
"Life is an adventure."

07:27.047 --> 07:28.279
What does that mean in this context?

07:28.348 --> 07:29.848
Something dumb, Greg. But I don't care.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.883
My baby has a cool older friend.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.457
Weird question, but does
our daughter always walk around

07:39.526 --> 07:41.192
with a candlestick in her jacket?

07:41.261 --> 07:43.161
What the hell is that?

07:44.131 --> 07:46.898
Oh, no.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.801
Oh, God. Look on the mantel.

07:49.870 --> 07:50.969
It's from her playdate.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.137
She stole it?

07:52.205 --> 07:54.005
- This is bad.
- This is very bad.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.774
Our daughter's a thief.
How did this happen?

07:55.842 --> 07:57.208
How did this happen?

07:57.277 --> 07:59.744
This is not my fault.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.279
I steal pretzels.

08:01.348 --> 08:02.614
It's more of a Robin Hood thing.

08:02.683 --> 08:03.882
I take from the rich
and give to the poor.

08:03.950 --> 08:04.916
We're the poor.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.551
Yes, you're a complex antihero.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.653
Ugh, of all people,
why did she have to steal

08:08.722 --> 08:10.573
from Chloe Brown Mueller?

08:10.667 --> 08:11.856
Why do you say all three names?

08:11.925 --> 08:14.426
I used to be you. Yeah.

08:19.818 --> 08:22.318
Do you think Anna-Kat stealing
is related to her OCD?

08:22.387 --> 08:25.154
No, I think it's just regular
bad-kid behavior.

08:25.223 --> 08:27.690
We could look at it
as another step forward.

08:27.759 --> 08:29.125
So we should be proud?

08:29.194 --> 08:31.227
Well, not openly.

08:31.296 --> 08:33.395
But when we look in each other's eyes,

08:33.465 --> 08:35.265
let's know it's there.

08:39.304 --> 08:40.837
Sweetie, Mama and Daddy

08:40.905 --> 08:42.672
have something important to ask you,

08:42.741 --> 08:44.107
and you have to be honest.

08:44.174 --> 08:45.708
Okay.

08:45.777 --> 08:47.210
Whose candlestick is this?

08:47.279 --> 08:48.745
It's mine.

08:48.813 --> 08:49.946
Are you sure?

08:50.015 --> 08:51.948
- Yep.
- Are you really sure?

08:52.017 --> 08:53.116
Yep.

08:53.184 --> 08:54.918
Well, okay, then.

08:56.187 --> 08:58.454
That usually works.
I don't know how to proceed.

08:58.523 --> 08:59.989
Anna-Kat, we know that you're lying.

09:00.058 --> 09:02.191
You stole this
from Penny's house, didn't you?

09:02.260 --> 09:04.360
- Yep.
- Why did you do that?

09:04.429 --> 09:05.762
'Cause I wanted it.

09:05.830 --> 09:07.030
And are you sorry?

09:07.098 --> 09:08.364
Sure.

09:16.474 --> 09:18.408
Did you hear her voice?

09:18.476 --> 09:19.842
It was so calm and icy.

09:19.911 --> 09:22.211
And those eyes... I don't think
she blinked the entire time.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.113
- We have to do something.
- I agree.

09:24.182 --> 09:25.415
I believe the simplest solution

09:25.483 --> 09:27.850
is obviously an
"Ocean's Eleven"-style con.

09:27.919 --> 09:29.519
We sneak the candlestick back
into the house...

09:29.587 --> 09:30.987
no harm, no foul.

09:31.056 --> 09:33.022
Katie, you always plan these
"Ocean's Eleven"-style cons,

09:33.091 --> 09:34.724
and they always end up
more like "Ocean's Twelve."

09:34.793 --> 09:36.993
- Well, then what do you suggest?
- I say we take the high road.

09:37.062 --> 09:38.261
We go to Chloe's house
and tell the truth.

09:38.330 --> 09:40.430
If Chloe Brown Mueller
finds out Anna-Kat's a thief,

09:40.498 --> 09:41.764
she will tell all the other moms,

09:41.833 --> 09:43.933
and then Anna-Kat will never
have another playdate again.

09:44.002 --> 09:45.835
Teaching Anna-Kat morals
is way more important.

09:45.904 --> 09:47.303
She needs to apologize in person.

09:47.372 --> 09:48.738
She'll be embarrassed
and never do it again.

09:48.807 --> 09:50.873
And Anna-Kat will not only
be the weird kid,

09:50.942 --> 09:52.875
she'll be the weird kid that steals.

09:52.944 --> 09:54.510
She doesn't even come
from a good family, Greg.

09:54.579 --> 09:56.913
She's got nothing going for her.

09:56.982 --> 10:00.116
You see this?
This is me putting my foot down.

10:00.185 --> 10:01.617
Ha!

10:01.686 --> 10:03.619
Was that my knee?

10:04.789 --> 10:06.389
Fine.

10:06.458 --> 10:07.991
You're right.

10:09.027 --> 10:10.393
Wait, did I just win a fight?

10:10.462 --> 10:11.894
Greg, don't be so surprised.

10:11.963 --> 10:14.197
You've won almost three fights
in our marriage now.

10:15.967 --> 10:17.900
Yep, 3:00 works.

10:17.969 --> 10:19.535
I'll meet you there.

10:48.566 --> 10:50.566
Mystery solved.

10:56.207 --> 10:57.440
Oliver!

10:57.509 --> 10:59.075
¿Cómo estás?

10:59.144 --> 11:00.343
Muy bien. ¿Y tú?

11:00.412 --> 11:02.345
What the hell is this?

11:11.222 --> 11:12.855
Do we have to tell the truth?

11:12.924 --> 11:15.091
- Yeah, do we?
- Guys, we're telling the truth.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.025
Ugh.

11:16.094 --> 11:17.427
It's the right thing to do.

11:19.998 --> 11:21.397
Katie!

11:21.466 --> 11:23.232
What a pleasant surprise.

11:23.301 --> 11:24.467
Hi, Anna-Kat.

11:24.536 --> 11:26.469
Oh. Chloe Brown Mueller.

11:26.538 --> 11:29.572
Hi, Chloe... Brown Mueller.

11:30.708 --> 11:32.442
- I had to say all three.
- Right.

11:32.510 --> 11:34.243
Sorry to pop by like this,
but my husband and I

11:34.312 --> 11:36.679
came here to talk to you about
something a little awkward.

11:36.748 --> 11:37.980
Can we come in?

11:38.049 --> 11:40.450
Of course. Come on in.
Make yourself at home.

11:40.518 --> 11:43.086
I'm live on Facebook,
and I need to wrap up.

11:43.154 --> 11:44.720
Hey, guys, I'm back.

11:44.789 --> 11:47.957
Now, in my opinion, what's
the biggest joy of motherhood?

11:48.026 --> 11:49.025
Everything.

11:50.695 --> 11:52.895
Hey, look at that.

11:52.964 --> 11:56.499
Someone else in Westport
baked a colonial onion pie.

11:56.568 --> 12:00.503
Hello. Hey. It's the pie guy.

12:00.572 --> 12:02.672
- Greg.
- Greg, that's right.

12:02.740 --> 12:03.906
Folks down at the Historical Guild

12:03.975 --> 12:06.142
call you "Pie Guy," so now
that's stuck in my head.

12:06.211 --> 12:09.045
- Pie Guy. That's a cool nickname.
- Yeah.

12:09.114 --> 12:11.681
Oh, Katie, Anna-Kat,
this is Stan Lawton.

12:11.749 --> 12:13.749
He's the recording secretary of
the Westport Historical Guild.

12:13.818 --> 12:16.819
Pleasure. And you must be
Penny's new friend.

12:16.888 --> 12:18.087
That's actually why we're here.

12:18.156 --> 12:20.456
You see, Anna-Kat and Penny
had a playdate.

12:20.525 --> 12:21.524
And on the playdate...

12:21.593 --> 12:23.025
She just had the best time ever.

12:23.094 --> 12:25.595
Oh, excuse me one second.

12:25.663 --> 12:27.597
I'm so sorry. I have to take this.

12:27.665 --> 12:29.565
A business owner wants to modify a sign

12:29.634 --> 12:31.868
- down in the historic district.
- Ha.

12:31.936 --> 12:34.151
You listen to me, you son of a bitch.

12:34.346 --> 12:35.549
What are you doing?

12:35.643 --> 12:36.760
- Mission abort.
- Why?

12:36.862 --> 12:38.573
Stan is in charge of membership
of the Historical Guild.

12:38.683 --> 12:40.049
If we tell the truth,
I'm never getting in.

12:40.111 --> 12:41.544
What about apologizing?

12:41.612 --> 12:42.712
You'll learn your lesson later.

12:42.780 --> 12:43.946
Now, go find Penny and play.

12:44.015 --> 12:45.548
You had this awesome idea earlier...

12:45.616 --> 12:46.782
something about "Ocean's Eleven."

12:46.851 --> 12:48.984
I can't do that.
I don't have any of the stuff.

12:49.053 --> 12:51.687
No crickets, no dry ice,
no firecrackers.

12:53.925 --> 12:55.391
I'm gonna put it back now.

12:56.194 --> 12:58.594
Footsteps, footsteps!
Sorry to have you wait,

12:58.663 --> 13:02.264
but if I don't get 100 likes
a day, I can't sleep.

13:02.333 --> 13:03.799
So, you wanted to talk to me about

13:03.868 --> 13:04.934
something a little awkward?

13:05.002 --> 13:06.602
It's awfully embarrassing.

13:06.671 --> 13:08.404
I completely forgot
to write a thank-you note

13:08.473 --> 13:10.473
for Anna-Kat's playdate this morning.

13:10.541 --> 13:12.274
We are so sorry.

13:12.343 --> 13:15.277
I did notice, but I didn't want
to say anything.

13:15.346 --> 13:17.079
Apology accepted.

13:17.148 --> 13:18.447
Chloe Brown Mueller,

13:18.516 --> 13:20.182
you are a forgiving woman.

13:20.251 --> 13:21.450
Oh.

13:21.519 --> 13:23.252
Shall we sit?

13:23.321 --> 13:24.420
Even he says all three names.

13:24.489 --> 13:26.122
I know.

13:27.558 --> 13:30.126
We got to get them out of the room.

13:30.194 --> 13:31.827
I don't mean to impose,

13:31.896 --> 13:33.729
but do you have anything to drink?

13:33.798 --> 13:35.831
Of course. Where are my manners?

13:35.900 --> 13:37.900
And, Stan, I remember you saying
that you had actual cannonballs

13:37.969 --> 13:39.435
used against the British at Compo Beach.

13:39.504 --> 13:41.303
- I'd love to see those.
- Refreshments and cannonballs

13:41.372 --> 13:43.105
coming right up.

13:43.174 --> 13:44.940
Roberta, we're thirsty!

13:45.009 --> 13:46.008
Here's the cannonball.

13:46.077 --> 13:47.109
Okay.

13:47.178 --> 13:48.811
Cool.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.312
They're more round than I thought.

13:50.381 --> 13:52.214
Yes, yes, very round.

13:52.283 --> 13:55.317
I said the exact same thing
first time I saw them.

13:55.386 --> 13:57.553
- Remember that, honey?
- It was our wedding night.

13:57.622 --> 13:59.455
We were making love.

13:59.524 --> 14:02.291
What do we do now?

14:02.360 --> 14:04.593
You know what goes great with iced tea?

14:04.662 --> 14:06.495
Greg's colonial onion pie.

14:06.564 --> 14:08.297
We should all have a slice.

14:08.366 --> 14:10.232
You know what? Why not?

14:10.301 --> 14:12.101
- Okay.
- Let's keep Westport's history

14:12.170 --> 14:14.403
as a leading onion producer alive, huh?

14:14.472 --> 14:15.671
Oh, you got the reference.

14:15.740 --> 14:17.573
Okay, here we are.

14:17.642 --> 14:19.141
Ta-da!

14:19.210 --> 14:21.510
Ohh, that smell is...

14:21.579 --> 14:23.779
Historically accurate.

14:23.848 --> 14:26.148
- Thank you.
- Say, I have a fun idea.

14:26.217 --> 14:29.452
What if instead of eating
this gross pie, we went outside?

14:29.520 --> 14:32.054
That's a fantastic idea.

14:33.591 --> 14:34.757
Ohh!

14:34.826 --> 14:36.225
- Oh, that stinks.
- Whoo!

14:38.997 --> 14:41.564
<i>Dry ice would have made this
so much sexier.</i>

14:49.907 --> 14:51.340
Even though the pie literally made Stan

14:51.409 --> 14:53.242
throw up in the birdbath,
I think he really appreciated

14:53.311 --> 14:56.178
- what I was going for.
- You see? The low road works.

14:56.247 --> 14:58.614
You're just one step closer
to joining the Historical Guild,

14:58.683 --> 15:00.416
and Anna-Kat's reputation is safe.

15:00.485 --> 15:02.184
We still have to deal with you,
young lady.

15:02.253 --> 15:05.588
But for now, cheers. To the low road.

15:05.657 --> 15:06.956
It worked, and no one got hurt.

15:07.025 --> 15:08.624
Actually, somebody did get hurt.

15:08.693 --> 15:10.998
Chloe Brown Mueller fired
her housekeeper for stealing.

15:11.062 --> 15:12.828
- What?
- Chloe knew the candlestick

15:12.897 --> 15:14.764
was missing and suspected Roberta.

15:14.832 --> 15:17.733
She told her if she returned it,
there'd be no consequences.

15:17.802 --> 15:19.001
But Chloe lied.

15:19.070 --> 15:20.770
And when you two
put the candlestick back,

15:20.838 --> 15:23.906
Chloe took it as proof
that Roberta stole

15:23.975 --> 15:25.207
and fired her.

15:26.144 --> 15:28.010
Pass the salt.

15:28.513 --> 15:30.279
How do you know all this?

15:30.348 --> 15:32.181
It's my business to know things.

15:32.250 --> 15:35.251
Plus, the real headline here is
you got an innocent woman fired.

15:35.319 --> 15:37.086
Let's focus on that.

15:37.155 --> 15:39.588
I retract my cheers.
The low road stinks.

15:39.657 --> 15:41.686
Just like a colonial onion pie.

15:41.756 --> 15:43.592
Hello! Salt, please.

15:43.670 --> 15:46.095
This meatloaf is bland.

15:51.944 --> 15:55.361
We can't let an innocent woman
lose her job because of our lie.

15:55.564 --> 15:56.767
Can we?

15:56.845 --> 15:58.483
We have to come clean
and tell the truth.

15:58.556 --> 16:00.183
Even though it means Chloe
will tell everyone

16:00.252 --> 16:01.485
Anna-Kat's a criminal

16:01.553 --> 16:03.353
and Stan won't let you
into the Historical Guild?

16:03.422 --> 16:05.255
Yeah, sometimes taking
the high road isn't enjoyable.

16:05.324 --> 16:06.590
It's never enjoyable.

16:06.658 --> 16:08.291
That's why I don't take it.

16:09.228 --> 16:10.761
There is another way.

16:10.829 --> 16:12.295
I have certain information that can help

16:12.364 --> 16:13.830
everyone walk away a winner.

16:13.899 --> 16:15.165
Who are you?

16:15.234 --> 16:17.467
And where are you getting
your information?

16:17.536 --> 16:19.970
I know where.

16:20.038 --> 16:21.972
Why is everyone dramatically entering.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.540
Mom, Dad,

16:23.609 --> 16:26.209
Oliver's dating an old Mexican lady.

16:27.413 --> 16:29.913
I told you I'd find out the truth.

16:29.982 --> 16:32.349
- Yeah, that's not it.
- Taylor.

16:32.418 --> 16:34.451
Will somebody please put
the pieces together for me

16:34.520 --> 16:35.886
like you guys do at movie night?

16:35.954 --> 16:37.788
I'll tell you everything if you promise

16:37.856 --> 16:39.656
not to punish me for anything I say.

16:39.725 --> 16:40.991
Here's my counter.

16:41.059 --> 16:42.726
If you want to continue to live
under this roof

16:42.795 --> 16:46.096
or actually on the planet,
you will talk now.

16:46.165 --> 16:48.532
Okay. Here's my counter to your counter.

16:49.868 --> 16:51.268
I'll tell you everything.

16:51.336 --> 16:53.336
It all started a few months ago
when you bought me

16:53.405 --> 16:55.038
a defective shirt from the outlet mall.

16:55.107 --> 16:56.706
There was nothing wrong with that shirt.

16:56.775 --> 16:58.108
I'm telling a story here.

16:58.177 --> 16:59.376
I was going to throw it away

16:59.445 --> 17:01.645
until I met Viv's housekeeper, Luz.

17:01.713 --> 17:03.113
Throwing away a good shirt?

17:03.182 --> 17:04.647
See, the bat is askew.

17:04.715 --> 17:07.349
I can re-stitch this in two
minutes, make it good as new.

17:07.419 --> 17:10.854
And ever since then, Luz and I
have been business partners.

17:10.923 --> 17:13.957
We buy defective shirts
at the outlet mall,

17:14.026 --> 17:18.694
fix them, and sell them
to kids in Norwalk for a profit.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.468
Easy money.

17:24.536 --> 17:26.736
Luz.

17:30.442 --> 17:32.542
All the housekeepers in town
are friends.

17:32.611 --> 17:34.244
They hear everything
that goes in the houses

17:34.313 --> 17:36.226
they work in, including Chloe's.

17:36.348 --> 17:38.002
That's how I knew Roberta got fired.

17:38.083 --> 17:40.217
Luz gives me all the dirt.

17:41.153 --> 17:42.819
That's his evil smile, Greg.

17:43.922 --> 17:45.756
This is gonna be good.

17:49.428 --> 17:52.295
Your housekeeper didn't steal
the candlestick.

17:52.364 --> 17:53.864
Anna-Kat did.

17:53.932 --> 17:57.134
And we are so sorry that we let
the lie go on for this long.

17:57.202 --> 17:59.403
Thank you.

17:59.471 --> 18:01.004
And mother to mother, I promise you

18:01.073 --> 18:03.940
that Anna-Kat stealing
will stay our little secret.

18:04.009 --> 18:05.575
I appreciate that.

18:05.644 --> 18:08.945
But we both know the second
that we leave here,

18:09.014 --> 18:10.447
you're going to pick up that phone

18:10.516 --> 18:11.715
and start texting all of Westport

18:11.784 --> 18:13.116
that my daughter's a thief.

18:13.185 --> 18:15.051
Katie, it's called freedom of the press.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.219
Let's make a deal.

18:16.288 --> 18:17.888
You keep your mouth shut about Anna-Kat

18:17.956 --> 18:20.724
and rehire your housekeeper,
and I won't tell anyone

18:20.793 --> 18:22.025
about your dirty secrets.

18:22.094 --> 18:24.027
What secrets? My life is an open book.

18:24.096 --> 18:26.229
Does the name Natalie Ryan ring a bell?

18:26.298 --> 18:27.697
Oh, yeah.

18:27.766 --> 18:30.434
I know that you were not the one
who decorated this perfect home.

18:30.502 --> 18:33.370
You hired an interior designer.

18:33.439 --> 18:34.571
You bitch.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.339
Your mommy blog is ghost-written

18:36.408 --> 18:38.848
- by a general studies major at UConn.
- Stop it.

18:38.903 --> 18:41.144
And your legal name
isn't Chloe Brown Mueller.

18:41.213 --> 18:42.479
It's Wanda Wiggly.

18:42.548 --> 18:44.214
- Wigglé.
- For God sakes,

18:44.283 --> 18:45.615
look what you're doing to her.

18:45.684 --> 18:48.151
All right, fine. Fine, you win, okay?

18:48.220 --> 18:50.253
I promise I won't gossip about Anna-Kat

18:50.322 --> 18:52.222
if you'll keep those lies to yourself.

18:53.892 --> 18:56.159
Oh. Yeah.

18:56.228 --> 18:59.686
And Greg wants to join
the stupid Historical Guild.

18:59.874 --> 19:01.598
Is that all right with you,

19:01.667 --> 19:05.635
Stan Lawton from Norwalk, Connecticut?

19:08.740 --> 19:11.775
At least now I can stop suppressing
my thick Norwalk accent.

19:11.844 --> 19:14.216
There, that's better.

19:14.279 --> 19:16.169
- Ugh.
- Greg, you are officially invited

19:16.248 --> 19:17.747
to join the Historical Guild.

19:17.816 --> 19:19.850
Yahoo-hoo-hoo!

19:19.918 --> 19:21.952
It was the pie that put me over the top.

19:24.389 --> 19:26.894
Oh, and Anna-Kat and Penny
still get to play together,

19:26.964 --> 19:29.526
or else I am going to tell everyone...

19:31.864 --> 19:32.929
I'm out of secrets.

19:34.366 --> 19:36.867
Just think it'd be nice
to get the kids together.

19:37.730 --> 19:41.183
If you stick to it,
the low road works. Just does.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.027
Don't touch me. It's all right, darling.

19:48.726 --> 19:50.692
Someone stole my ponies.

19:50.761 --> 19:53.495
Actually, sweetie, Mommy
and Daddy stole your ponies.

19:53.564 --> 19:54.996
Why would you do that?!

19:55.065 --> 19:56.765
We wanted to show you how it
feels when someone

19:56.834 --> 19:59.000
takes something away from you
that's important.

19:59.069 --> 20:01.536
- How do you feel?
- It feels awful.

20:01.605 --> 20:02.738
It sure does.

20:02.806 --> 20:05.340
I'm never stealing again.

20:07.386 --> 20:09.276
Now I want to return everything.

20:10.088 --> 20:11.213
Everything?

20:13.639 --> 20:18.639
