[narrator] <i>If I had to pick
a yearbook quote, it would be,</i>

00:40.708 --> 00:43.792
<i>"Lonely in life, popular in death."</i>

00:44.417 --> 00:46.500
- <i>See that girl flying up in the air?</i>
-[shutter clicks]

00:46.583 --> 00:49.250
<i>That's me, Darby Harper.</i>

00:49.833 --> 00:52.833
<i>My upbringing was pretty awesome at first.</i>

00:53.833 --> 00:55.500
-[chuckles] <i>That's my mom.</i>
-[cheers]

00:55.583 --> 00:58.458
<i>I was following
in her iconic cheer footsteps.</i>

00:58.542 --> 00:59.875
[crowd cheering]

00:59.958 --> 01:03.917
<i>Back then, I thought I knew who I was
and who I wanted to be.</i>

01:04.000 --> 01:06.708
- <i>Until everything came crashing down.</i>
-[Mom] There's Dad.

01:06.792 --> 01:09.292
-Darby!
-[water splashes]

01:11.625 --> 01:13.917
<i>My mom and I died on the same day.</i>

01:14.458 --> 01:16.208
[lifeguard] One. Two…

01:16.292 --> 01:19.667
<i>And even though I technically
came back from the other side,</i>

01:19.750 --> 01:21.958
-[thunder rumbling]
- <i>I was never the same.</i>

01:25.875 --> 01:29.208
<i>What was different about me?
Are you sitting down for this?</i>

01:31.958 --> 01:33.458
[whispering] <i>I see dead people.</i>

01:34.625 --> 01:35.958
[normal voice] <i>Everywhere.</i>

01:36.583 --> 01:38.250
<i>And it turns out the dead,</i>

01:38.333 --> 01:41.125
- <i>or "Deados" as I like to call them,</i>
-[Darby] Excuse me.

01:41.208 --> 01:42.917

01:43.542 --> 01:45.833
-[Dad] Hey.
-[Darby's friends cheering]

01:45.917 --> 01:49.042
<i>So, that's when I turned my back
on the living world</i>

01:49.125 --> 01:51.292
<i>and decided to start
my little side hustle,</i>

01:51.375 --> 01:53.625
- <i>counseling local spirits.</i>
-Hello.

01:57.792 --> 02:01.208
<i>Over time, I learned that not every person
who died stuck around.</i>

02:02.583 --> 02:05.250
<i>Only those who have
some unfinished business.</i>

02:06.000 --> 02:08.958
-[doorbell rings]
- <i>And this is where I come in…</i>

02:09.042 --> 02:13.625
-[door opens]
- <i>…as a spiritual messenger of sorts,</i>

02:14.708 --> 02:19.292
<i>making sure the Deados don't get stuck
in a world that no longer sees them.</i>

02:21.000 --> 02:24.750
<i>With my assistance,
these spirits were able to cross over,</i>

02:26.833 --> 02:28.708
<i>which is pretty beautiful.</i>

02:32.500 --> 02:36.250
<i>Word spread in the purgatory circuit,
and my after-school job took off.</i>

02:36.333 --> 02:37.542
Hey, how are you?

02:37.625 --> 02:39.083
<i>There's no pay,</i>

02:39.167 --> 02:43.042
<i>but if dead people gratitude
had monetary value,</i>

02:44.042 --> 02:45.542
<i>I'd be Jeff Bezos.</i>

02:53.167 --> 02:54.167
[car horn honks]

02:54.250 --> 02:57.500
<i>You'd think witnessing dead people say,
"Goodbye" over and over again</i>

02:57.583 --> 02:59.292
<i>would be my biggest burden,</i>

02:59.375 --> 03:01.125
<i>but it is a distant second</i>

03:01.208 --> 03:05.917
<i>to the torturous realm where I am forced
to spend my days, high school.</i>

03:06.000 --> 03:09.667
I can't believe you think this is
a better education than homeschooling.

03:09.750 --> 03:11.458
[scoffs] I mean, look at them.

03:13.417 --> 03:15.958
Honey, I have a hard time
getting you to come out for dinner.

03:16.042 --> 03:17.958
I mean,
how else can I get you to socialize?

03:19.708 --> 03:23.417
I make, like, ten new dead friends a week.
How much more social can I get?

03:23.958 --> 03:26.000
-[bell rings]
-[Dad] I love you.

03:26.083 --> 03:27.208
[Darby] Love you too.

03:27.292 --> 03:28.875
Try to have a good day.

03:28.958 --> 03:32.375
-[student outside school] Hey, babe.
-Hey, isn't that Capri Donahue?

03:32.875 --> 03:34.417
[student whistles]

03:41.042 --> 03:43.458
Honey, I just don't get
why you two stopped hanging out.

03:43.542 --> 03:47.167
You were joined at the hip.
Maybe y'all should reconnect.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.708
Oh, no. I lost my hard-earned smile.

03:52.542 --> 03:54.000
[engine starts]

03:57.500 --> 03:59.333
[students chattering]

04:02.667 --> 04:06.250
It truly amazes me that
at the most formative time of their lives,

04:06.333 --> 04:08.667
a time that should be about
self-discovery,

04:08.750 --> 04:11.708
and finding what is individual
and unique about themselves,

04:11.792 --> 04:13.667
they instead
choose to homogenize in groups

04:13.750 --> 04:16.375
that give them the unhealthy acceptance
they so deeply crave.

04:16.458 --> 04:18.167
You're so lucky your mom let you.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.750
I was going under the knife
for my deviated septum anyway,

04:20.833 --> 04:24.375
so we just thought that we'd get
my boobs done at the same time.

04:24.458 --> 04:27.708
And that's why I'd rather hang out
with the unliving than the unwoke.

04:27.792 --> 04:29.667
[skater dude 1 burps]

04:29.750 --> 04:31.750
-Gross, sorry.
-Hey, dude,

04:31.833 --> 04:34.625
La Croix eruption at Mount McMuffin, dude.

04:34.708 --> 04:37.583
Did I mention that I spent
last Friday night discussing modern art

04:37.667 --> 04:41.375
with a woman who claimed to be
Frida Kahlo's lover? Just saying.

04:43.875 --> 04:44.875
[sighs]

04:45.875 --> 04:47.500
In the ecosystem of high school,

04:47.583 --> 04:50.125
I'm basically a hermit crab
hiding under a reef.

04:50.208 --> 04:52.292
And I wouldn't have it any other way.

04:54.417 --> 04:58.083
That's my friend, Gary. He's a "Stayer."
A Stayer is a Deado who--

04:58.167 --> 05:01.333
-[laughing] Oh, my God. No way!
-I know. And she said, "Fetch."

05:01.417 --> 05:03.375
-Ew.
-Your jacket is really cute, by the way.

05:03.458 --> 05:06.917
Oh, thanks. It's amazing what I can do
with a sewing machine and a little thread.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.542
Capri Donahue.

05:08.625 --> 05:12.333
Head phony. Ever heard of someone
described as having solid character?

05:12.417 --> 05:14.708
Oh, my God.
The Sweet Seventeen promo video?

05:14.792 --> 05:16.333
-I know.
-Oh, I'm living for it.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.333
Well, Capri's is pure particle board.

05:18.417 --> 05:19.458
[singsongy] I know!

05:19.542 --> 05:23.000
Good morning, Miss Lyman.
You look like a breath of fresh air.

05:23.083 --> 05:24.167
[coughing] Kiss ass.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.625
Oh, Darby. Forgot you went here.

05:26.708 --> 05:27.875
Hmm.

05:29.792 --> 05:31.708
-[student] Babe.
-[Capri gasps] Jamesy!

05:31.792 --> 05:32.792
I missed you.

05:34.333 --> 05:37.917
In case you couldn't tell by that dramatic
<i>Bachelor Nation</i> -style spin,

05:38.000 --> 05:39.250
that's Capri's boyfriend.

05:39.333 --> 05:40.917
James Harris was a band geek

05:41.000 --> 05:43.875
who had been completely invisible
to Capri until--

05:43.958 --> 05:49.167
♪ <i>I needed you, oh
But I never showed</i> ♪

05:49.250 --> 05:55.042
♪ <i>And I wanna stay with you
Until we're gray and old</i> ♪

05:55.125 --> 05:57.625
Even though he didn't make it past
the blind audition round,

05:57.708 --> 05:58.917
it was enough fame for Capri

05:59.000 --> 06:01.542
to turn her chair
and set her thirsty hooks in him.

06:01.625 --> 06:04.333
-[bell rings]
-Good morning, newly minted junior class.

06:04.417 --> 06:06.583
-Whoo!
-[Lyman] Welcome to biology lab.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.792
Before you get too comfortable,
I've paired you up with your lab partner

06:09.875 --> 06:11.208
alphabetically by last name.

06:11.292 --> 06:13.625
Go ahead and take a seat with that person.

06:13.708 --> 06:17.792
I don't even have to look at the list.
Ever since first grade, it's always--

06:17.875 --> 06:19.708
-Harper.
-Harris.

06:20.458 --> 06:22.500
Uh, Miss Lyman,
I need to be partnered with James

06:22.583 --> 06:25.792
because I'm trained to assist him
with his learning disability.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.125
[whispering] He has dyslexia.

06:27.208 --> 06:28.792
[softly] No, he doesn't.

06:28.875 --> 06:31.375
I'm sure James
will manage on his own, Capri.

06:31.458 --> 06:32.917
[sighs]

06:33.000 --> 06:35.875
Capri knows I'm the one person
she can't get to like her.

06:35.958 --> 06:38.375
I'm the one girl in school who doesn't
wanna be her,

06:38.458 --> 06:40.292
the one person
who can see through her bullshit.

06:40.375 --> 06:41.542
[clears throat]

06:44.458 --> 06:45.875
[sighs]

06:47.167 --> 06:48.958
-[laughs]
-Hi, baby.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.125
Babe, I'm at a different table.
I'm not going off to war.

06:52.208 --> 06:53.958
Oh, my God. Don't even say that.

06:54.042 --> 06:55.833
All right. Let's get started.

06:55.917 --> 06:59.542
Uh, excuse me, Miss Lyman?
There's an ass on my desk.

06:59.625 --> 07:02.250
-[students giggling]
-Oh, I'm sorry. This is a fresh blowout.

07:02.333 --> 07:04.542
I didn't even see anyone was sitting here.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.083
[whispering] Freak show.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.625
I'm sorry. She can be
a little extra sometimes. [chuckles]

07:12.208 --> 07:13.208
Extra psychotic.

07:14.833 --> 07:17.208
-I like your Chucks.
-Oh, thanks.

07:17.958 --> 07:18.958
Yeah.

07:20.125 --> 07:22.042
James is a good guy.

07:22.125 --> 07:25.375
He was actually my first crush
back in sixth grade. [inhales sharply]

07:25.458 --> 07:28.833
Before I realized that romantic
relationships are just a social construct

07:28.917 --> 07:32.250
people created to avoid the fact that
we're all helplessly alone in this world.

07:34.167 --> 07:36.250
-[Gary chuckles]
-Mmm. I got you this time.

07:36.333 --> 07:37.333
I do.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.083
-Hmm. Boom.
-Eh, nah, nah, nah, nah. Bishop to e4.

07:45.167 --> 07:46.917
Ugh, crap. That's--

07:47.000 --> 07:48.833
Yeah, that's-- That would be checkmate.

07:48.917 --> 07:49.917
Mmm.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.417
[inhales deeply] And that would also be
two more bucks you owe me, kid.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.417
Come on. You don't even use money.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.542
I know, I know.
But I love to leave it in Linda's purse.

07:58.625 --> 08:02.875
She gets a big boost when she finds it.
Treat herself to some fancy coffee drink.

08:02.958 --> 08:04.875
[sighs] All right.
That is pretty frigging adorable.

08:04.958 --> 08:07.333
[laughs] All right, come on. Pay up.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.250
[sighs] I really wish you took Venmo.

08:09.333 --> 08:10.333
[bell rings]

08:10.417 --> 08:12.375
I hope you have
a wonderful rest of the day.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.625
Thank you, Gary.
I appreciate it. I'll try.

08:17.667 --> 08:19.875
[chattering]

08:22.042 --> 08:23.917
[students chattering in background]

08:24.583 --> 08:28.083
Hey, hi. Uh, you're the girl
from the bleachers, right?

08:28.167 --> 08:30.167
Uh, I don't talk to clients here.

08:30.250 --> 08:31.292
Uh. [chuckles]

08:31.375 --> 08:33.708
Come by my office Friday night, okay?
That's where I work.

08:33.792 --> 08:34.958
Work--

08:36.542 --> 08:38.708
-Oh, shit.
-[laughs] Are you okay?

08:39.292 --> 08:41.750
I mean, you look like
you've just seen a ghost.

08:41.833 --> 08:45.167
[sighs] The opposite, actually.
I thought you were--

08:46.083 --> 08:49.000
Never mind. I just--
I haven't seen you before.

08:49.083 --> 08:51.875
Great. You two found each other.

08:51.958 --> 08:55.583
-Alex is new, and he's gonna need…
-Oh, God. Please, no.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.708
…a junior study buddy
to show him the ropes.

08:57.792 --> 08:58.792
[Darby titters]

08:58.875 --> 09:01.208
[whispering] He just transferred in
from a Montessori school,

09:01.292 --> 09:02.792
so all this is pretty foreign to him.

09:02.875 --> 09:06.667
Oh, okay. Yeah, I don't know
if I'm the best person to do that.

09:06.750 --> 09:09.958
Sure, you are. You're an honors student,
and you both seem like such--

09:11.083 --> 09:13.667
-He's thinking, "Weirdos."
-Abstract thinkers.

09:13.750 --> 09:14.750
-Mmm. [chuckles]
-Yeah.

09:14.833 --> 09:18.083
Extracurricular activities meet-and-greet
starts in ten minutes.

09:18.708 --> 09:22.625
Walk Alex through it.
Help him acclimatize. [clicks tongue]

09:23.208 --> 09:26.500
-That guy. Uh, we're-- Yep.
-Yep. Okay.

09:29.750 --> 09:33.750
So, do you have any burning questions
about Frederick Douglass High

09:33.833 --> 09:36.000
I can answer in the next two minutes?

09:36.083 --> 09:37.958
Uh, that for starters.

09:38.583 --> 09:41.875
Yeah, the superintendent passed a bill
allowing corporate sponsorship

09:41.958 --> 09:45.625
of cafeterias so that schools could save
on the cost of lunches. [chuckles]

09:45.708 --> 09:47.000
Jeez.

09:47.083 --> 09:49.167
My old school
didn't have this type of structure.

09:49.250 --> 09:51.833
You know,
the bell telling you when and where to go,

09:51.917 --> 09:54.333
having to raise your hand
to get permission to take a leak.

09:54.417 --> 09:57.167
Public school is only
a few rules away from the Marines.

09:57.250 --> 09:59.417
[laughing] Yeah. That's funny.

10:01.417 --> 10:03.292
So, why did you leave Montessori?

10:03.792 --> 10:08.167
I had a bit of a rough patch last year.
You know, some issues, so--

10:08.250 --> 10:10.458
I feel your pain, junior class buddy.

10:10.542 --> 10:12.167
So, who do you hang with?

10:12.250 --> 10:13.625
Uh, I don't.

10:13.708 --> 10:15.458
Oh. The lone wolf.

10:15.542 --> 10:16.542
[chuckles]

10:16.625 --> 10:19.042
You said something earlier
about your work?

10:19.125 --> 10:21.958
Oh, no. N-- It was nothing. [laughs]

10:22.042 --> 10:23.417
I thought you were someone else.

10:23.500 --> 10:26.333
Um, I do some social work
on Friday nights.

10:26.417 --> 10:27.583
Social work?

10:27.667 --> 10:30.917
When in doubt, the truth gets people
to bug off every time.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.375
Yeah. Yeah, it's for dead people.
I help them pass on to the next realm.

10:34.458 --> 10:36.083
Uh-- [laughs]

10:36.167 --> 10:40.208
That's really cool.
I'm actually into psychic mediums too.

10:41.042 --> 10:43.000
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. What are the odds?

10:43.083 --> 10:44.083
That backfired.

10:44.667 --> 10:47.292
[Alex] So, uh,
are you in any of these clubs?

10:47.375 --> 10:49.375
Maybe in another lifetime.

10:49.458 --> 10:51.333
At my old school,
I had a Stephen King book club.

10:51.417 --> 10:52.458
Oh, uh-huh.

10:52.542 --> 10:54.542
But you know,
if I'm forced to be here, which I am,

10:54.625 --> 10:59.208
I've decided I want the most public school
experience ever known to man.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.000
[laughs] Wow.
You're quite the glass half-full guy.

11:02.833 --> 11:06.208
I mean, if you don't embrace
the absurdities in life, right?

11:06.292 --> 11:07.292
It's unlivable.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.250
Mmm.

11:09.333 --> 11:11.375
Ooh, prom. I've seen that in the movies.

11:11.458 --> 11:13.000
[laughs]

11:13.917 --> 11:15.417
Uh, I gotta run.

11:16.125 --> 11:17.917
Oh. Okay, uh--

11:18.708 --> 11:21.875
I-I'd love to talk to you more
about the paranormal stuff.

11:21.958 --> 11:24.292
[sighs] Lone wolf, Alex.

11:24.375 --> 11:27.542
-"Lone" being the key adjective there.
-Right. [chuckles]

11:29.000 --> 11:30.333
Yeah. See you.

11:30.417 --> 11:31.458
[howls]

11:31.958 --> 11:32.958
Yeah.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.375
Mmm. That's not good.

11:35.458 --> 11:37.208
All right. Listen up, people.

11:37.292 --> 11:41.292
We got a few cheerleaders here who want
to do a special presentation just for you.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.208
And action!

11:43.292 --> 11:44.625
Let's go. [claps]

11:44.708 --> 11:47.125
Hi, Cougars!
I'm Capri Donahue, and this is--

11:47.208 --> 11:48.208
Taylor.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.125
Taylor, Bree, Piper and Todd.

11:52.208 --> 11:55.875
And we're here to tell all the gym classes
about cheer tryouts next week.

11:55.958 --> 11:58.417
Here's a little skit we prepared.
Hope you enjoy!

11:58.917 --> 12:00.292
Hi! Are you new here?

12:00.375 --> 12:02.042
Yes, I'm a freshman.

12:02.125 --> 12:04.458
-[gasps]
-[Taylor] And I've always dreamed of being

12:04.542 --> 12:06.750
a cheerleader,
but I'm so intimidated by it.

12:06.833 --> 12:08.625
Isn't it just for shallow, hot girls?

12:08.708 --> 12:11.917
I'm so glad you asked.
And the answer is, that's offensive.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.958
Cheerleaders aren't just pretty people
who are happy all the time.

12:15.042 --> 12:17.625
We face the same challenges.
Just like you.

12:17.708 --> 12:19.917
Really? Even you, the head cheerleader?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.750
-[Capri] Yes, even me.
-Yeah.

12:21.833 --> 12:24.083
But cheer allows us
to be the change that we wanna see.

12:24.167 --> 12:27.000
[Bree] We support female empowerment,
just like Beyoncé.

12:27.083 --> 12:28.333
When one of us falls-- [gasps]

12:28.417 --> 12:30.833
-The sisterhood is there to catch us.
-Jesus.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.708
Next week, I'll be there.

12:32.792 --> 12:34.125
[whispering] Piper, at the end.

12:34.208 --> 12:36.208
But cheer keeps the world moving.

12:36.292 --> 12:37.917
Because when something gets us down--

12:38.000 --> 12:40.250
-[Piper] Cheer--
-Lifts us back up. [giggling]

12:41.167 --> 12:42.708
[dance music playing]

12:43.583 --> 12:45.542
[crowd cheering, applauding]

12:45.625 --> 12:47.292
Let's hear it, Cougars!

12:47.375 --> 12:50.292
[cheerleaders] Tryouts next week,
show us what you can do.

12:50.917 --> 12:52.292
[Bree] Tryouts next week!

12:52.375 --> 12:53.833
-[Taylor] Now, Piper!
-"Now," what?

12:53.917 --> 12:55.250
Next week? I'll be there.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.167
-Shit.
-[Bree and Capri] Whoo!

12:57.250 --> 12:59.167
-[Bree] Let's go, Cougars!
-[Taylor] Whoo!

12:59.250 --> 13:02.167
My dad said I can only invite 50 people,
but I was, like,

13:02.250 --> 13:04.750
"Come on,
the DJ tent holds at least a hundo."

13:07.083 --> 13:09.917
Ugh! Can we get a corporate sponsor from…

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
[electricity crackles]

13:11.083 --> 13:14.417
…the electric company or something?
This is ridiculous.

13:18.042 --> 13:19.167
Give me my clothes.

13:19.917 --> 13:22.958
Why would I take your clothes?
Not planning on attending a funeral.

13:23.042 --> 13:24.458
[laughing]

13:24.542 --> 13:27.625
I have no problem walking up
to Principal Morgan's office in my towel

13:27.708 --> 13:30.000
to discuss his zero tolerance
bullying policy.

13:30.083 --> 13:32.542
Oh, my God!
You're totally gaslighting me right now.

13:32.625 --> 13:35.958
You're the one who bullied me
in front of the entire class this morning.

13:36.042 --> 13:37.583
You called me an ass.

13:37.667 --> 13:40.917
Technically,
I called your actual ass an ass.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.958
Maybe you'll understand that more when
we get to the anatomy section of bio lab.

13:45.042 --> 13:46.625
[laughs, clears throat]

13:46.708 --> 13:47.708
[laughs]

13:51.000 --> 13:54.625
It was just a joke. No need to go crying
to the principal, freak show.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.333
-[screams, gasps]
-[water splashes]

13:57.417 --> 13:59.167
Ow! My ass.

13:59.250 --> 14:00.417
-Capri!
-Are you okay?

14:00.500 --> 14:02.917
I'm fine. Just-- [sighs] I slipped.

14:03.667 --> 14:04.792
[electricity crackling]

14:04.875 --> 14:06.792
[whimpers]

14:06.875 --> 14:08.167
[crackling fades]

14:09.292 --> 14:10.375
[police radio chatter]

14:10.458 --> 14:14.583
[officer] Miss Harper, thank you
so much for giving us your statement.

14:14.667 --> 14:17.583
We'll be in touch
if we have any follow-up questions.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.000
Miss Harper?

14:20.583 --> 14:22.625
Uh-- Yeah, yes. [chuckles] Okay.

14:22.708 --> 14:23.708
Okay.

14:25.542 --> 14:26.542
All right, ladies.

14:26.625 --> 14:29.333
[sniffs] Go home, get some rest.

14:30.625 --> 14:33.417
Remember,
we have grief counselors available.

14:34.083 --> 14:37.625
Seeing a dead person
is a very traumatic experience

14:37.708 --> 14:40.750
which none of us are equipped for.

14:40.833 --> 14:42.542
[laughs]

14:42.625 --> 14:43.917
[Darby coughing]

14:44.000 --> 14:45.625
[whispers] Sorry.

14:45.708 --> 14:48.250
Something in the throat. [clears throat]

14:50.958 --> 14:53.208
-[birds chirping]
-[dog barking in distance]

14:57.792 --> 14:59.042
Hey.

14:59.125 --> 15:01.125
[Darby] Hey. [chuckles]

15:01.833 --> 15:04.250
[groans, sighs]

15:06.125 --> 15:08.542
Yeah. She was a beauty.

15:13.667 --> 15:16.083
I know you don't like
talking about your mom.

15:18.958 --> 15:20.542
And I'm not trying to push you.

15:22.208 --> 15:26.125
I know Capri's death
is probably a trigger. Right?

15:26.208 --> 15:29.458
No. No, really. I'm-- I'm fine.

15:30.875 --> 15:32.042
Honey.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.125
I'm just tired.

15:36.667 --> 15:38.458
So-- But thank you.

15:41.875 --> 15:42.875
Night.

15:45.583 --> 15:47.750
-[Dad] I love you.
-Love you.

15:52.333 --> 15:53.583
[sighs]

16:09.917 --> 16:11.958
Wake up, bitch. Wake up!

16:13.417 --> 16:14.417
Oh, goddamn it.

16:14.500 --> 16:15.875
[gasps]

16:15.958 --> 16:18.583
-[light switch clicks]
-So it's true. You can see me.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.792
[Darby] How did you even-- Uh--

16:20.875 --> 16:22.750
Remember groundskeeper Gary?

16:22.833 --> 16:24.375
-Uh--
-Yeah.

16:24.458 --> 16:27.000
He told me all about
your little "ability."

16:27.500 --> 16:28.583
-[sighs]
-Bring me back.

16:28.667 --> 16:29.667
Darby!

16:30.250 --> 16:32.250
Bring me back. Now!

16:32.958 --> 16:37.375
Capri, I can't bring you back.
I can only help you move on.

16:38.292 --> 16:39.292
Move on?

16:40.792 --> 16:43.125
No. Cheer tryouts are next week.

16:43.208 --> 16:44.958
My Sweet Seventeen
is coming up in a month.

16:45.042 --> 16:47.958
I've planned it the whole year.
It costs more than my sister's wedding.

16:48.042 --> 16:50.542
[inhales sharply]
Denial. It's the hardest stage.

16:50.625 --> 16:53.708
Listen, I'm-- [sighs]
…I'm really sorry you died.

16:53.792 --> 16:57.042
I truly am. But you are dead,

16:57.125 --> 16:59.833
and neither I,
nor anyone else can bring you back.

17:01.958 --> 17:04.375
[electricity crackling, whooshing]

17:04.458 --> 17:05.833
[screams]

17:05.917 --> 17:06.958
[Capri gasps]

17:08.333 --> 17:09.792
Holy crap!

17:10.500 --> 17:11.833
-Did I do that?
-[sighs]

17:11.917 --> 17:14.792
-Am I coming back to life?
-No, dude, you're a form of energy.

17:14.875 --> 17:17.250
So, with intense focus and practice,

17:17.333 --> 17:19.583
or I guess just pure,
unfiltered teenage rage,

17:19.667 --> 17:22.000
Deados can manipulate things
in the real world.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.625
-"Deados?"
-Yeah. Yeah, that's what I call your kind.

17:25.708 --> 17:27.583
The in-betweeners like you.

17:28.917 --> 17:31.208
Okay, but-but-but what about, um, Gary?

17:31.833 --> 17:34.167
-I mean, he died our freshman year, right?
-Yeah.

17:34.250 --> 17:37.208
He's a Stayer.
It means he chooses to be here.

17:37.292 --> 17:40.292
He's waiting for his wife to die
so they can pass on together.

17:41.750 --> 17:46.292
Okay, cute. Um.
Then, I will be a Stayer too.

17:47.208 --> 17:51.125
Yeah. I don't wanna go to some…
[scoffs] …creepy afterlife. No, thank you.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.417
No, no. Capri,
this is not where you're meant to be,

17:53.500 --> 17:56.083
so it'll be very difficult
for you to be at peace here.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.792
Especially you, feeling like
you're missing out on all that stupid shit

17:59.875 --> 18:01.667
-you think is so important.
-[gasps]

18:02.292 --> 18:04.667
Oh, it might be stupid shit to you,
freak show,

18:04.750 --> 18:06.792
but this is the best year of my life.

18:06.875 --> 18:08.708
Everyone thinks senior year is peak,
but no.

18:08.792 --> 18:11.000
Seniors have one foot out the door
to college.

18:11.083 --> 18:15.542
I am at the epicenter
of the ultimate high school experience.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.375
[sighing] I'm not going anywhere.

18:19.250 --> 18:22.708
You literally will never be able
to see yourself again.

18:22.792 --> 18:24.542
You're dead.

18:26.125 --> 18:28.208
So is all that shit you care about.

18:28.292 --> 18:31.500
Cheer championships,
homecoming, your birthday.

18:31.583 --> 18:33.125
You can't experience it anymore.

18:33.750 --> 18:34.750
[sighs]

18:35.625 --> 18:37.125
[exhales deeply]

18:37.208 --> 18:38.208
I'm sorry.

18:41.458 --> 18:44.375
Look, I can deliver whatever message
you want to whomever.

18:45.542 --> 18:50.292
But once you make the decision
to move on, you move on.

18:53.458 --> 18:54.708
[Darby sighs]

18:54.792 --> 18:57.792
Look, you can stay here tonight
if you're freaked out.

18:58.750 --> 19:01.667
But I'm going to sleep because,
well, I'm alive,

19:01.750 --> 19:03.875
and I have another day
of living hell tomorrow.

19:04.792 --> 19:06.750
I'm sorry you died.

19:06.833 --> 19:07.833
[light switch clicks]

19:09.208 --> 19:13.167
<i>I'm Katlyn Kelley, reporting live
from Frederick Douglass High School,</i>

19:13.250 --> 19:16.417
<i>where yesterday, students witnessed
the shocking and tragic death</i>

19:16.500 --> 19:18.875
<i>of their popular classmate,
head cheerleader,</i>

19:18.958 --> 19:20.208
Capricorn Donahue.

19:20.292 --> 19:23.250
[sighs] I'm on TV,
and I can't even enjoy it.

19:23.333 --> 19:26.250
Grieving students
have been visiting this memorial

19:26.333 --> 19:28.167
for the beloved cheerleader.

19:29.083 --> 19:32.250
Could you tell us a little about
what made Capri so special?

19:32.333 --> 19:36.292
[sighs] She was an amazing person
and such a great friend.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.208
And I'm just gonna miss her so much.

19:38.292 --> 19:40.458
I've literally
never seen you before in my life.

19:40.542 --> 19:44.042
Capri was planning a big
Sweet Seventeen birthday for next month.

19:44.125 --> 19:45.792
Can you tell us more about that?

19:45.875 --> 19:48.667
[sobbing, sniffling] Yeah,
she was so excited about the party.

19:48.750 --> 19:51.792
She put everything she had
into planning it.

19:51.875 --> 19:54.292
Oh, guys! I'm still here-- [screams]

19:54.375 --> 19:57.750
Is there anything else you would like
our viewers to know about Capri?

19:57.833 --> 20:03.083
Just that she was the glue
that bonded together our sisterhood.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.708
She was actually a Scorpio.

20:07.375 --> 20:11.417
<i>Also, follow us on Instagram. Thank you.</i>

20:12.250 --> 20:16.875
<i>A young spark of life, gone in a flash.
A cheer heard no more.</i>

20:16.958 --> 20:20.042
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Maybe you should stay at home.

20:20.125 --> 20:21.583
[Katlyn] <i>Signing off.</i>

20:21.667 --> 20:23.583
Nah, it's just putting off the inevitable.

20:24.333 --> 20:26.792
[Capri] That's the photo
you brought to my shrine?

20:26.875 --> 20:30.708
Taylor, you look adorable,
and my eyes are literally closed!

20:30.792 --> 20:31.833
[screams]

20:34.458 --> 20:36.417
-[gasps]
-[Bree] Did you guys see that?

20:42.500 --> 20:44.542
[sighs]

20:45.083 --> 20:46.917
[Cougars laughing]

20:47.000 --> 20:49.833
[Taylor] That practice killed me.
Capri would have been so proud.

20:49.917 --> 20:52.875
[Bree] Nationals, here we come! [cheers]

20:52.958 --> 20:55.292
[giggles] So, where are we going tonight?

20:55.375 --> 20:56.750
[chatters indistinctly]

20:58.708 --> 21:01.083
I just can't believe that she's gone.

21:01.167 --> 21:04.000
I had my nose modeled after hers.

21:04.083 --> 21:07.458
I heard she shot 50 feet in the air,
and her pants flew off.

21:07.542 --> 21:10.125
Do you think James Harris
will rejoin jazz band now?

21:10.208 --> 21:13.417
[student 5] "Dead Cheerleader"
is a killer name for a band.

21:13.500 --> 21:17.208
[student 6] Alive Capricorn Donahue
was an "it girl," but dead Capri Donahue?

21:17.292 --> 21:19.167
Oh, she's a legend, honey.

21:19.750 --> 21:22.250
[Gary] Hey, here she is--
Hey, Darby. My buddy, Mel.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.792
-Hi.
-He passed last night.

21:24.875 --> 21:26.333
-Uh, heart attack.
-Yeah.

21:26.417 --> 21:28.292
-Oh. Sorry.
-You know. So if you don't mind,

21:28.375 --> 21:30.500
he's gonna sit and watch
our lunchtime chess games

21:30.583 --> 21:32.875
-until you can help him move on.
-Yeah, sure.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.667
My wife, Deb, uh, she passed 17 years ago,

21:35.750 --> 21:37.292
and you know, that's a long time.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.333
I was in a lot better shape then, right?

21:39.417 --> 21:41.167
Uh, what if she's not

21:41.250 --> 21:42.958
-attracted to me anymore?
-Maybe.

21:43.042 --> 21:45.750
Well, I like to think
that when you pass on,

21:45.833 --> 21:47.542
you pass as your optimal self.

21:47.625 --> 21:50.667
And I'm pretty sure that has nothing
to do with your superficial exterior.

21:50.750 --> 21:52.625
Oh, my optimal self?

21:52.708 --> 21:54.750
-Yeah.
-I like that.

21:54.833 --> 21:56.958
-[Gary laughs]
-[laughs] Okay.

21:57.042 --> 21:59.417
-Well, we'll talk soon.
-Way to be, Darby. Thank you.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.667
-She is good!
-I told you, huh?

22:03.500 --> 22:05.042
[Darby] Oh, no.

22:09.958 --> 22:11.083
Oh, thank God.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.458
-Hola! Oh!
-Oh! Jeez-- [scoffs]

22:17.542 --> 22:20.208
-God, you scared the shit out of me.
-[laughing] Oh. Sorry.

22:20.292 --> 22:21.292
Are you okay?

22:21.375 --> 22:23.083
Yeah, fine. I--

22:23.875 --> 22:26.500
It's just someone I'm trying to avoid.
[chuckles]

22:26.583 --> 22:29.000
Oh. Got a little stalker? [laughs]

22:29.083 --> 22:30.542
[inhales sharply] Potentially.

22:30.625 --> 22:32.042
Oh, you're serious.

22:32.750 --> 22:34.625
-Oh, my bad. Okay. Uh…
-[chuckles]

22:35.375 --> 22:37.083
You wanna talk about it?

22:38.333 --> 22:42.250
Well, the frustrating thing is,
is I don't think anyone would understand.

22:42.333 --> 22:43.583
Mmm. I get that.

22:44.417 --> 22:48.042
Don't have to explain anything to me,
I'm just making sure you're okay.

22:48.917 --> 22:50.042
Thanks.

22:51.833 --> 22:53.208
-Um--
-So, what's up?

22:53.292 --> 22:55.750
So, you were there
with the cheerleader yesterday?

22:56.292 --> 22:57.667
That's pretty intense.

22:57.750 --> 22:59.625
[sighs] Yeah. [screams]

22:59.708 --> 23:02.792
Whoo! Sorry, Alex. Too much caffeine.

23:02.875 --> 23:06.542
Uh, sorry. Uh, I-- I gotta go but I'll s--
Thanks for the--

23:06.625 --> 23:07.625
Just thanks.

23:08.208 --> 23:09.833
-I need to talk to you.
-[Alex] Okay.

23:09.917 --> 23:11.833
I don't work at school, Capri.

23:11.917 --> 23:15.167
What do you mean, "Work"?
I'm not asking you to do my taxes.

23:15.250 --> 23:16.625
-[sighs]
-[bell rings]

23:18.292 --> 23:19.292
[sighs]

23:19.833 --> 23:21.000
[door closes]

23:21.083 --> 23:22.250
Okay, what do you want?

23:22.917 --> 23:25.500
I have decided that I do,
in fact, want to move on.

23:25.583 --> 23:28.042
It's incredibly boring being here
and being invisible.

23:28.125 --> 23:30.125
Also, apparently,
I'm stuck in this outfit.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.667
If I knew I was gonna die,
I would've worn way more accessories.

23:32.750 --> 23:34.833
Smart decision. Come see me Friday night.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.208
Whoa! I haven't told you
when I wanna move on.

23:38.292 --> 23:40.000
Okay, I don't have time for this.

23:40.083 --> 23:42.750
It'll be next month.
After my Sweet Seventeen.

23:42.833 --> 23:45.792
No. No, just go to your funeral.
Yeah, everyone will be crying

23:45.875 --> 23:48.333
and talking about
how awesome you were. You'll love it.

23:48.417 --> 23:50.875
Ew, no. I hate funerals,
they're mad depressing.

23:50.958 --> 23:53.500
I want the party.
Which is where you come in.

23:53.583 --> 23:55.750
You're gonna make sure
the party still happens.

23:55.833 --> 23:57.375
[scoffs]

23:57.458 --> 24:01.250
I think that curling iron incident
fried your last remaining brain cell.

24:01.333 --> 24:02.625
I-- [gasps]

24:07.250 --> 24:08.708
[exhales sharply]

24:08.792 --> 24:09.792
Game on.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.833
Ideally, you'll do this voluntarily.

24:12.917 --> 24:16.208
But I've been practicing the whole
manipulation of objects thing all morning.

24:16.292 --> 24:19.167
So, I can make life very weird
for you if it comes down to it.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.542
-Psycho.
-[scoffs]

24:20.625 --> 24:22.583
[Lyman] I just wanted to let you know.

24:22.667 --> 24:25.375
-Sorry I'm late.
-[Lyman] That's okay, Darby.

24:25.458 --> 24:26.458
[door closes]

24:26.542 --> 24:29.125
As I was saying,
James will not be in today.

24:29.208 --> 24:31.458
For obvious reasons.

24:31.542 --> 24:36.000
Bree, Taylor, Piper, my condolences.
I know you girls were very close.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.625
She really would've wanted us
to be here today.

24:38.708 --> 24:40.958
To remember her with everyone else.

24:41.042 --> 24:43.542
That's true. I mean,
they're no good to me crying in private.

24:43.625 --> 24:47.875
[Lyman] All right. Let's get started.
If you uncover the tray in front of you,

24:47.958 --> 24:49.667
you'll find today's project.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.000
-Ugh.
-[biology student 2] Gross!

24:51.083 --> 24:52.958
-Cool!
-I'm reporting this to PETA.

24:53.042 --> 24:54.292
I'm sorry, buddy.

24:54.375 --> 24:56.542
Um, Darby, I wanted to see
if you wouldn't mind

24:56.625 --> 24:59.250
dropping off James's lab homework
for him until he's back.

24:59.333 --> 25:01.625
Oh. Uh,
I don't really think that'd be approp--

25:01.708 --> 25:03.625
-What? Say yes!
-Yes, of course.

25:03.708 --> 25:04.833
[Taylor] Oh, my God.

25:04.917 --> 25:08.708
Capri's Sweet Seventeen promo video
has over, like, 200,000 views.

25:08.792 --> 25:10.750
-Really?
-Yeah. They played it on the news.

25:10.833 --> 25:13.500
-[party music plays]
-It's so tragic that it's canceled.

25:13.583 --> 25:15.292
Darby!

25:15.375 --> 25:16.917
Don't ignore me.

25:18.292 --> 25:20.208
Hey! I'm serious.

25:22.208 --> 25:24.833
[electricity crackles, whizzes]

25:24.917 --> 25:27.250
-Hmm.
-[whispering] What are you doing? Stop.

25:27.333 --> 25:29.958
-Help me get the party back on.
-[whispering] No.

25:30.042 --> 25:31.583
[whizzing]

25:31.667 --> 25:34.458
-[whispering] Stop it.
-Darby, is everything okay?

25:34.542 --> 25:35.750
Yes, fine.

25:36.417 --> 25:38.000
[electricity crackling]

25:38.083 --> 25:40.208
-[grunts]
-[gasps, screams]

25:40.292 --> 25:42.417
-[biology student] Ew. Gross!
-[Taylor] Oh, my God.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.917
-What the f--
-[Darby] Oh-- I'm--

25:44.000 --> 25:45.583
Sorry, my hand slipped. [laughs]

25:45.667 --> 25:47.333
Haven't you done enough?

25:47.417 --> 25:49.333
Excuse me. I don't feel well.

25:49.417 --> 25:51.083
-[whispers] My God.
-What just happened?

25:51.167 --> 25:52.917
-Okay, class. Carry on.
-Oh, my God.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
What a freak.

25:54.083 --> 25:55.917
-Clearly, she needs therapy.
-Hmm.

25:58.917 --> 26:00.625
What the hell are you doing to me?

26:00.708 --> 26:02.542
-Just say you'll help me.
-No.

26:03.750 --> 26:05.083
[grunting]

26:05.167 --> 26:06.167
What are you-- No!

26:06.250 --> 26:08.083
[shoes squeaking]

26:08.167 --> 26:10.958
No! No, no, no, no!

26:11.042 --> 26:13.458
-[shouting] No! No, no!
-[electricity whizzing]

26:13.542 --> 26:16.500
-Sorry, I just really have to pee.
-Mm-hmm.

26:16.583 --> 26:18.750
-[electricity crackling]
-[screams]

26:20.375 --> 26:23.708
-No. What are you-- No!
-It's just till the party's back on.

26:23.792 --> 26:26.417
No way in hell! [grunting]

26:27.375 --> 26:28.833
[screams]

26:28.917 --> 26:30.583
-Stop. No. Capri!
-[crackling intensifies]

26:30.667 --> 26:32.250
Stop, stop!

26:32.333 --> 26:33.542
No, no, no, no!

26:33.625 --> 26:35.792
-[toilet flushes]
-[Darby screams]

26:39.833 --> 26:41.792
-A public toilet?
-[scoffs]

26:41.875 --> 26:45.125
I could've contracted
any number of deadly diseases.

26:45.208 --> 26:46.542
This is criminal bullying.

26:46.625 --> 26:48.833
I think it's criminally good haunting.

26:48.917 --> 26:50.625
Fine. You know what? Have at it.

26:50.708 --> 26:53.708
I'll just keep ignoring you
until I'm committed to a psych ward.

26:53.792 --> 26:56.750
Or you could help me
and be free in a month.

26:56.833 --> 27:00.000
All I want is to go to this party.
To see my friends having fun,

27:00.083 --> 27:02.250
and to dance next to James one last time.

27:02.333 --> 27:03.792
And then I'll move on.

27:05.917 --> 27:08.000
-I promise.
-And in what worldly dimension

27:08.083 --> 27:09.833
do you think I can throw your dream party?

27:09.917 --> 27:12.167
Me, the girl you call, "Freak show"?

27:12.250 --> 27:14.917
In a world where
I make you popular enough to do it.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.750
[laughs]

27:17.667 --> 27:21.208
[Capri] <i>I'm gonna
let you in on a little secret.</i>

27:21.292 --> 27:22.917
<i>Being popular is an illusion.</i>

27:23.000 --> 27:25.917
<i>Like a magic trick, or cryptocurrency.</i>

27:26.000 --> 27:29.375
<i>You just have to believe in it.
And then they will too.</i>

27:31.542 --> 27:33.500
First, you'll need to get close
to Taylor and Bree,

27:33.583 --> 27:35.625
so you can convince them
to throw the party in my honor.

27:35.708 --> 27:37.333
[scoffs] Yeah, that sounds attainable,

27:37.417 --> 27:39.750
since they hate me
with the passion of a thousand suns.

27:39.833 --> 27:43.875
Excuse me. You won't be able to avoid them
once you join cheer.

27:43.958 --> 27:46.458
[laughing] Never.

27:46.542 --> 27:47.542
[sighs]

27:48.750 --> 27:52.542
Aw, look at us little nuggets
in our cheesy matching uniforms.

27:52.625 --> 27:54.375
Hey, get outta there.

27:54.458 --> 27:56.958
I forgot we were even friends that summer.

27:57.042 --> 27:59.917
Then you were all weird
when we got back to school.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.125
Oh, sorry. I was just going through
a little thing called my mom died.

28:08.167 --> 28:10.125
Your mom was so boss.

28:11.125 --> 28:12.125
[chuckles]

28:13.667 --> 28:15.667
Top of the pyramid at the '93 Nationals.

28:19.125 --> 28:21.125
Did she come to you too after she died?

28:21.708 --> 28:23.250
Get out.

28:23.333 --> 28:25.500
Okay! Touchy subject.

28:25.583 --> 28:29.375
But don't you think that she'd want you
to be like she was in that picture?

28:29.458 --> 28:32.000
Happy? Smiling? Do you even have teeth?

28:32.083 --> 28:34.500
[scoffs]
You're really blowing your pitch, Capri.

28:34.583 --> 28:35.958
Well, I just don't understand

28:36.042 --> 28:38.417
why you wouldn't wanna be,
at the very least, normal.

28:38.500 --> 28:39.625
Well, I'm not normal.

28:39.708 --> 28:43.000
I've spent my childhood
being a travel agent for dead people.

28:43.083 --> 28:46.042
-Okay, and? We all have baggage. [laughs]
-[scoffs]

28:47.125 --> 28:50.542
Yeah, like getting zits and wondering
if anyone will ask you to prom.

28:50.625 --> 28:52.125
Deep.

28:52.833 --> 28:55.833
You're the most judgmental
and self-righteous person I've ever met.

28:55.917 --> 28:58.292
What? No, I'm not.

28:58.375 --> 29:01.333
Okay, then prove it. If you really
don't care what people think about you,

29:01.417 --> 29:04.542
then what does it matter if you hang out
with the popular crew for a month

29:04.625 --> 29:05.958
or less, even?

29:07.125 --> 29:08.125
[sighs]

29:08.958 --> 29:13.250
[inhales sharply] So, as soon as the party
is back on, do you promise to leave?

29:13.333 --> 29:15.958
Do I have your word
you'll leave after the party?

29:16.042 --> 29:19.833
Okay, yes. I promise.
Cross my heart and hope to die. Again.

29:19.917 --> 29:21.083
[sighs]

29:21.875 --> 29:23.000
Okay, fine.

29:23.083 --> 29:24.083
Yes!

29:25.958 --> 29:29.000
The first order of business
is a full head-to-toe glow up.

29:29.792 --> 29:31.375
Hey.

29:31.458 --> 29:34.750
-What's wrong with this?
-[sighs] It's a lot of black, Darbs.

29:37.917 --> 29:38.917
No.

29:40.917 --> 29:42.375
My God. Burn that.

29:45.542 --> 29:46.875
What's all this stuff?

29:47.542 --> 29:49.542
My mom's old clothes from the '90s.

29:49.625 --> 29:51.167
Retro.

29:52.583 --> 29:53.958
I dig it!

29:54.042 --> 29:55.458
[laughing] Darby, stop it.

29:55.542 --> 29:56.833
[machine whirring]

29:56.917 --> 30:00.375
Ooh, it's a two-piece suit.
Oh, it's a suit. [gasping]

30:00.458 --> 30:01.625
Darby.

30:04.583 --> 30:06.500
Stay still.

30:07.458 --> 30:08.833
Nope. No.

30:16.875 --> 30:18.583
Congratulations.

30:18.667 --> 30:23.250
You actually look kind of hot!
You need to post a selfie.

30:24.042 --> 30:25.042
To what?

30:25.125 --> 30:28.708
[sighs] What are you, an alien?
Or Amish or something?

30:28.792 --> 30:31.500
- <i>I found out to be popular…</i>
-Here.

30:31.583 --> 30:33.792
<i>…you need to post a lot of selfies.</i>

30:34.333 --> 30:36.625
Hold it. Find your angles.

30:36.708 --> 30:39.375
-You've never taken--
-What is-- What's my angle?

30:40.292 --> 30:42.458
- <i>Some selfies should be silly.</i>
-[shutter clicks]

30:42.542 --> 30:45.375
<i>And you should test out every filter
until your eyes lose all perspective,</i>

30:45.458 --> 30:47.625
<i>and you pick one where
it looks like you have jaundice.</i>

30:47.708 --> 30:49.667
[shutter clicking]

30:49.750 --> 30:54.292
Using too many emojis comes off
as desperate and thirsty.

30:54.375 --> 30:59.375
But three carefully curated emojis,
radiates sophistication and class.

30:59.958 --> 31:03.458
Eggplants? Penises. Kitty cats? Vaginas.

31:03.542 --> 31:05.958
And a peach is a butt.

31:06.542 --> 31:11.167
Well that certainly changes the meaning of
that text I sent my grandma this morning.

31:11.750 --> 31:13.958
Just keep the captions simple.

31:14.042 --> 31:15.042
[sighs]

31:15.667 --> 31:18.250
Two hours and 88 photos later,

31:18.333 --> 31:20.833
I had six usable selfies
posted to my feed.

31:23.042 --> 31:25.833
If you don't embarrass yourself
on Instagram,

31:25.917 --> 31:27.542
maybe I'll train you on TikTok.

31:28.583 --> 31:29.958
Don't-- Don't do that.

31:30.042 --> 31:31.333
[bicycle bell rings]

31:31.417 --> 31:33.708
[Capri] I can imagine James
trying to block the party,

31:33.792 --> 31:35.667
thinking the girls
are only doing it for followers.

31:35.750 --> 31:38.792
-So you'll have to get him on board, okay?
-I'll try.

31:38.875 --> 31:42.708
Here it is. Aw, the tree house of love.

31:42.792 --> 31:44.792
That was our favorite make-out spot.

31:45.500 --> 31:46.500
Barf.

31:47.250 --> 31:52.167
Oh, Mrs. Harris? Hi, it's Darby.
I brought James's homework.

31:52.250 --> 31:55.500
Oh, go right on up.
He hasn't left his room all day.

32:00.625 --> 32:06.375

32:16.833 --> 32:20.917
Hi, Jamesy-- I mean, James.
[stammering] I brought your homework.

32:21.750 --> 32:23.417
You look different.

32:24.667 --> 32:28.750
Yeah, yeah. My cousin
just started cosmetology school

32:28.833 --> 32:31.875
-and needed a guinea pig. [laughs]
-Nice. Natural liar.

32:33.208 --> 32:36.583
-[softly] I love you.
-[sighs] Sorry, it's such a mess in here.

32:36.667 --> 32:38.458
-Just let me clean it up.
-Oh. No worries.

32:38.542 --> 32:40.542
-[sighs]
-He listens to oldies.

32:40.625 --> 32:41.625
Isn't it adorable?

32:41.708 --> 32:44.375
[exhales sharply]
I'm really sorry about Capri.

32:44.458 --> 32:46.917
I know she loved you a lot.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.750
Didn't you hate each other?

32:48.833 --> 32:52.708
Hmm. Love-hate.
We were close when we were younger.

32:52.792 --> 32:56.125
And we still talk, sometimes.
Uh, talked, sometimes.

32:56.208 --> 32:58.958
Oh. Right, I didn't realize that.

33:00.167 --> 33:03.833
[sighs] It's so weird, like I--
I know she's gone,

33:03.917 --> 33:06.125
but it still feels like
she's here with me.

33:06.208 --> 33:09.750
I mean, she was the most kind,
selfless person I've ever met.

33:09.833 --> 33:11.125
Really?

33:11.208 --> 33:15.083
[sighs] I mean, really.
Yeah. I totally get that.

33:15.167 --> 33:17.875
And when I didn't make it past
the blinds on <i>The Voice</i> …

33:18.750 --> 33:20.833
[sighs] …I felt like such a loser.

33:20.917 --> 33:23.417
But when I came back to school,
Capri helped me realize

33:23.500 --> 33:26.292
that failures are just life's way
of making you stronger.

33:26.833 --> 33:28.500
It's true. I was so supportive.

33:28.583 --> 33:30.833
[laughs] I'm sorry. I'm rambling.

33:30.917 --> 33:35.750
No. It's okay, really. I get it.
My mom died when I was seven.

33:36.708 --> 33:40.625
Yeah, I remember. Can't even imagine
how hard that's gotta be.

33:42.042 --> 33:44.250
Yeah. It's just so disorienting,

33:44.333 --> 33:47.708
like, one day your whole world
is flipped upside down

33:47.792 --> 33:50.042
and it feels like
you're on Mars or something,

33:50.125 --> 33:52.208
and you don't know
how to feel normal again.

33:52.292 --> 33:53.292
Yeah.

33:54.083 --> 33:55.583
That's totally how it feels.

33:56.875 --> 33:58.167
Uh, I should go.

33:58.250 --> 34:00.542
Look, thank you for bringing that over.

34:00.625 --> 34:04.333
It was nice to actually talk to someone.

34:09.792 --> 34:11.042
[ghost] Hey, Darby.

34:11.958 --> 34:14.833
<i>Death has a funny way
of teaching you what's most important.</i>

34:15.542 --> 34:17.708
<i>Like finally making that apology.</i>

34:17.792 --> 34:20.375
<i>Encouraging your child
to embrace who they are.</i>

34:21.042 --> 34:24.000
<i>And the one that always gets me,
that final, "I love you."</i>

34:24.875 --> 34:27.958
<i>The Deados never asked for anything
petty or superficial…</i>

34:28.042 --> 34:29.750
[sighs] <i>…until now.</i>

34:33.042 --> 34:34.083
[Dad] Whoa!

34:35.000 --> 34:36.208
Good morning, sweetheart.

34:36.292 --> 34:39.042
Morning. Don't make it a thing, okay?

34:39.125 --> 34:41.750
It's just a temporary experiment
for social studies.

34:41.833 --> 34:44.625
-It's just--
-What?

34:45.417 --> 34:47.000
You look like your mom.

34:54.375 --> 34:56.875
Okay, this is weird. What is happening?

34:57.583 --> 34:59.833
Who is that? I want her butt.

34:59.917 --> 35:02.750
Damn, smoke show. You got steez.

35:02.833 --> 35:04.583
Who is that? Is that Darby Harper?

35:04.667 --> 35:06.750
-What is everyone looking at?
-You, dummy.

35:06.833 --> 35:08.542
Shoulders back, head up, walk.

35:10.625 --> 35:11.625
Who's the new chick?

35:13.875 --> 35:16.875
[student 8 sighs] That's
head-to-toe vintage. Who's that girl?

35:16.958 --> 35:20.375
I don't know. But she's serving
'90s realness, and I'm so here for it.

35:20.458 --> 35:23.500
Don't scowl, smile a little.
[softly] They like you. Let them in.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.750
Okay, don't smile.
Um, try pouty. Cute pouty.

35:28.833 --> 35:29.958
[grunts] How?

35:30.667 --> 35:34.708
-[student 1] God, she is fire.
-[student 2] Super fresh.

35:35.792 --> 35:38.500
[students chattering in background]

35:41.792 --> 35:43.375
Is she wearing a couch cover?

35:43.458 --> 35:44.708
Hey. [chuckles]

35:44.792 --> 35:48.542
Darby? You look different.

35:48.625 --> 35:50.750
I mean a good different. [laughs]

35:50.833 --> 35:52.417
I mean, you always look great.

35:52.917 --> 35:54.375
-You wanna have a seat?
-Yeah.

35:54.458 --> 35:56.000
-No.
-[electricity crackling]

35:56.083 --> 35:59.958
-[Darby chuckling] Um--
-Darby, no. Absolutely not.

36:02.375 --> 36:04.750
[Taylor] Is she trying to sit
with the new guy?

36:04.833 --> 36:06.708
-No. Uh, no.
-[crackling continues]

36:07.750 --> 36:09.458
-[Darby] Stupid chair. Come on.
-No.

36:09.542 --> 36:12.792
[grunts] You know, I'll just stand.
Yeah, it's better for digestion.

36:12.875 --> 36:15.833
Hey, hey, new girl. You wanna come,
uh, eat lunch with us?

36:15.917 --> 36:18.167
That's Todd.
He's the cutest guy in the cheer squad.

36:18.250 --> 36:20.042
-You should definitely sit with us.
-No.

36:20.125 --> 36:21.500
Oh.

36:23.083 --> 36:24.333
No, what?

36:24.958 --> 36:28.500
No, I forgot that I have
something to get from my locker.

36:28.583 --> 36:30.042
No time for lunch. [chuckles]

36:31.458 --> 36:34.167
-[sighs]
-Darby! Hey, Darby!

36:34.250 --> 36:36.625
-[whispering] What?
-[whispering] What are you doing?

36:36.708 --> 36:38.917
Go sit at Todd's table.
Don't be such a weirdo.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.208
Well, I am a weirdo.

36:40.292 --> 36:43.833
My anonymity was my only means of survival
in this place.

36:43.917 --> 36:46.667
-I'm done.
-No. We have a deal.

36:47.625 --> 36:49.958
[scoffs] Oh, right. Your brilliant plan.

36:55.292 --> 36:56.625
[Darby] Hey.

36:56.708 --> 36:59.333
-What are you doing?
-You wanna know what I was thinking?

36:59.417 --> 37:02.167
Even though you hate me,
I could sit at your table at lunch,

37:02.250 --> 37:04.833
join cheer and we could all
become besties. [laughs]

37:07.208 --> 37:08.792
Have you gone fully mental?

37:08.875 --> 37:10.833
What? You don't wanna be my friend

37:10.917 --> 37:14.208
just 'cause I got a new haircut
and some lip gloss?

37:14.292 --> 37:16.000
Oh, my God.

37:16.875 --> 37:19.167
There, I tried.

37:19.250 --> 37:21.000
Your new style is hideous.

37:21.667 --> 37:24.875
[gasps] You wouldn't know
real fashion if it bit you on the tit.

37:25.792 --> 37:27.208
I thought it was cool.

37:27.292 --> 37:28.875
-I like her socks.
-Guys.

37:28.958 --> 37:30.542
-[snaps]
-What the hell was that back there?

37:30.625 --> 37:33.208
You have zero chill.
You need to get your shit together.

37:33.292 --> 37:35.417
I'm crawling back
into my hermit shell tomorrow.

37:35.500 --> 37:38.000
[sighs] Why are you such a defeatist?

37:38.917 --> 37:41.375
-[Gary] Oh, Darby, what are you doing?
-[grunts]

37:41.458 --> 37:44.083
-You've just left your king wide open.
-Defeatist is right.

37:44.167 --> 37:46.542
This is like watching <i>The Queen's Gambit</i>.
Except she sucks.

37:46.625 --> 37:48.458
-[Gary] Hey, hey. Darby, girl.
-Burn.

37:48.542 --> 37:52.083
Why don't you just do the cheer thing?
You know you want to.

37:52.167 --> 37:54.792
It'll be good, you'll meet new friends.
Ones with pulses.

37:54.875 --> 37:56.792
Yeah. And if you follow my plan,

37:56.875 --> 37:59.000
then you'll earn
their respect organically.

38:01.542 --> 38:02.750
And if I refuse?

38:02.833 --> 38:04.125
-[Gary groans]
-[laughs]

38:05.875 --> 38:07.333
-Oh-- Oh, my--
-[Gary, Mel] Whoa!

38:07.417 --> 38:09.750
Bitch, was that a frog? What the hell!

38:09.833 --> 38:14.167
I've been saving him since science class.
I am not giving up on my party, Darby.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.667
-There's more where that came from.
-[bell rings]

38:18.000 --> 38:20.542
Damn it! Fine! Fine.

38:20.625 --> 38:22.167
But this is a hostage situation,

38:22.250 --> 38:24.542
and that is on your karma report card,
not mine.

38:24.625 --> 38:26.458
Cheer tryouts are less than a week away.

38:26.542 --> 38:29.333
We're training every day during lunch
and after school. Hey!

38:29.417 --> 38:31.833
Your days of chess and donuts, over.

38:31.917 --> 38:34.583
Donuts. I will miss them.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Hmm.

38:42.708 --> 38:43.792
Four.

38:45.583 --> 38:46.750
You gonna do anything?

38:47.375 --> 38:48.833
Excuse me?

38:48.917 --> 38:50.750
Eight. Nine.

38:50.833 --> 38:54.958
Three. Five. Seven. Again.

38:55.042 --> 38:56.042
Everything okay?

38:56.833 --> 38:58.542
Yeah, just need a sec to focus.

39:00.125 --> 39:03.875
I haven't done this since,
well, you know, since my mom.

39:22.125 --> 39:24.250
-Hey, fresh homework.
-Thanks.

39:24.333 --> 39:25.333
No problem.

39:28.042 --> 39:30.250
[cheering]

39:30.333 --> 39:31.958
[whirring]

39:42.083 --> 39:44.083
[students chattering]

40:02.458 --> 40:05.083
-What's up? Did you hurt your ankle?
-[sighs]

40:05.167 --> 40:08.583
It's fine. It's nothing, I just--
I don't like the beach.

40:11.875 --> 40:13.958
You're gonna kill it at tryouts tomorrow.

40:14.708 --> 40:18.833
You're the best tumbler I've ever seen,
and I've been to Nationals, twice.

40:22.125 --> 40:24.167
Why did you quit when we were younger?

40:24.250 --> 40:26.667
You're honestly a natural,
just like she was.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.750
I don't wanna talk about my mother.

40:29.250 --> 40:30.250
Why?

40:32.208 --> 40:35.250
You know, I used to wish
I had your mom instead of mine.

40:36.125 --> 40:39.292
At least your mom waited
till she was dead to ignore you.

40:40.583 --> 40:43.125
Sometimes I think she might have stayed.

40:45.375 --> 40:48.542
But if she did, then why--
[sighs] Forget it.

40:49.875 --> 40:51.833
If she had stayed, then why what?

40:51.917 --> 40:54.000
I don't wanna talk about my mom, okay?

40:57.250 --> 40:58.250
Okay.

41:01.625 --> 41:03.542
Do you wanna scream about her instead?

41:04.292 --> 41:05.583
What?

41:05.667 --> 41:08.417
[shouting] I said,
do you want to scream about her?

41:08.500 --> 41:09.500
Cut it out.

41:09.583 --> 41:14.083
No. I think you'll feel a lot better
if you just scream a little bit!

41:14.167 --> 41:16.292
-[screams]
-Stop.

41:17.458 --> 41:18.667
Come on!

41:18.750 --> 41:20.042
Stop.

41:20.125 --> 41:22.875
[shouting] Are we gonna make
the team tomorrow, Darby Harper?

41:24.042 --> 41:25.292
Yes.

41:26.583 --> 41:30.708
[shouting] I said, are we gonna
make the team tomorrow?

41:30.792 --> 41:33.000
Yes! Yes! Okay?

41:33.083 --> 41:34.792
-Yes!
-Yes!

41:34.875 --> 41:38.250
Okay! That's what I'm talking about!

41:38.333 --> 41:40.333
[screaming]

41:40.417 --> 41:42.917
[shouting] I'm gonna make the team!

41:43.000 --> 41:45.250
[screaming]

41:45.333 --> 41:47.375
You're gonna make the team!

41:47.458 --> 41:50.833
All right. For those of you
who don't know who I am, I am Coach Paula.

41:50.917 --> 41:52.000
You gotta be kidding me.

41:52.083 --> 41:54.417
And we have some very exciting news.

41:54.500 --> 41:56.083
So, without further ado,

41:56.167 --> 41:58.083
-he's your mascot and mine…
-[cheering]

41:58.167 --> 42:00.250
…Douglas The Donut!

42:00.333 --> 42:01.833
-Look at this guy.
-Come on.

42:01.917 --> 42:04.917
-[cheering]
-Oh, my God! So cute. Go, Dougie!

42:05.000 --> 42:06.292
[mouthing words] Oh, wow.

42:08.667 --> 42:11.917
[auditionees chanting]
Time to rumble, time to go nuts!

42:12.000 --> 42:15.042
-Time to cheer for the Fighting Donuts!
-[Paula] She's pretty good.

42:15.125 --> 42:16.250
[cheering]

42:26.458 --> 42:28.875
-[Paula] Oh.
-[Becky] Oh, nice try.

42:28.958 --> 42:29.958
Let me see it.

42:30.458 --> 42:32.125
Show 'em your moneymaker, Darbs.

42:44.625 --> 42:45.625
[Capri] Yay!

42:47.375 --> 42:49.167
Suck on that, Taylor!

42:50.958 --> 42:52.042
-[Paula] Yeah.
-So good.

42:52.125 --> 42:53.542
[applauding]

42:56.833 --> 42:59.042
-You slayed that shit.
-[laughs]

42:59.125 --> 43:01.083
I'm so proud of you. How does it feel?

43:06.833 --> 43:10.333
I actually forgot how empowering it feels.
It's such a high.

43:10.417 --> 43:13.833
I feel like I have lockjaw
from forcing a smile for an hour.

43:13.917 --> 43:16.167
[donut] Great job out there. [grunts]

43:17.833 --> 43:19.792
[laughing] No way.

43:20.750 --> 43:22.542
You-- You know the donut?

43:22.625 --> 43:25.667
Yeah, I never would've thought
cheering was your thing.

43:25.750 --> 43:28.375
-You're full of surprises.
-I'm full of surprises?

43:28.458 --> 43:32.333
You weren't kidding when you said you were
gonna find the most ridiculous activity.

43:32.417 --> 43:36.500
Well, it counts as a gym class credit.
I get a free dozen donuts every game.

43:36.583 --> 43:38.917
And, come on, the outfit is sexy as hell.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.333
-[laughs]
-No, no, no, no.

43:40.417 --> 43:43.333
You cannot be friends with the donut.
This is social suicide.

43:43.417 --> 43:46.167
Uh, so--
Uh, update on your stalker situation?

43:46.917 --> 43:49.208
-It's ongoing.
-Ooh. Sorry to hear that.

43:49.292 --> 43:50.833
Step away from the donut.

43:51.875 --> 43:54.167
I'll talk to you later. Okay, Alex?

43:54.250 --> 43:55.250
Okay.

43:56.792 --> 44:01.458
I mean, that new cheer girl's
just sick on the mat. And cute.

44:01.542 --> 44:05.208
She's not new. That's Darby Harper.
And she's, like, a witch or something.

44:05.292 --> 44:07.208
Yeah. She basically killed Capri.

44:07.292 --> 44:09.333
[Paula] Thank you for your patience.

44:09.417 --> 44:14.250
If I call out your name,
welcome to the Fighting Donuts cheer team.

44:14.333 --> 44:15.333
You made it.

44:15.417 --> 44:19.125
[squeals] Yes! I knew you could do it.
God, I haven't felt this alive since--

44:19.208 --> 44:20.833
-Well, since I was alive.
-[chuckles]

44:22.167 --> 44:24.625
Darby Harper,
is that a smile on your face?

44:24.708 --> 44:27.208
Congrats on making the team, Darbs.
See you on the field.

44:27.292 --> 44:30.208
-Say thanks, weirdo.
-Thanks, weirdo, you. [chuckles]

44:32.333 --> 44:35.875
-How does he know I made the team?
-Probably posted it to IG. Check.

44:38.333 --> 44:40.833
Okay! Look at you with 756 followers.

44:40.917 --> 44:43.333
Congrats,
you're actually becoming a real person.

44:43.417 --> 44:46.500
Now, repost it to your story.
And, um, humble brag.

44:46.583 --> 44:48.333
Pretend like you don't actually care.

44:48.417 --> 44:49.750
Uh, I don't really care.

44:49.833 --> 44:51.875
Perfect! God, you're so good at that.

44:54.042 --> 44:55.167
<i>I actually did care.</i>

44:56.333 --> 44:59.167
<i>I'd finally started making it
in the living world,</i>

44:59.792 --> 45:03.208
<i>but it turns out there are
a lot of rules to being popular.</i>

45:03.833 --> 45:06.083
<i>Don't brag, only humble brag.</i>

45:06.167 --> 45:09.625
<i>It's okay to be moody, but never sad.
Sad is cringe.</i>

45:09.708 --> 45:11.042
<i>Don't try too hard.</i>

45:11.125 --> 45:13.292
<i>Be woke, but not a woke fisher.</i>

45:13.375 --> 45:16.250
<i>Don't be thirsty. Do listen. Do smile.
Speak clearly. Don't be angry.</i>

45:16.333 --> 45:18.833
<i>Be a winner. Don't worry.
Dress to impress. Don't overgram.</i>

45:18.917 --> 45:21.125
<i>I prefer the Deados any day.</i>

45:21.208 --> 45:23.792
<i>Sure, they're dead,
but at least they don't play games.</i>

45:25.542 --> 45:27.750
[inhales deeply, sighs]

45:27.833 --> 45:30.125
The admiration and envy
hang so heavily in the air,

45:30.208 --> 45:32.250
even a dead girl can smell its sweet musk.

45:32.333 --> 45:33.958
[laughing] Hey, hey, Darby!

45:34.042 --> 45:36.042
-Ah! Ah, ah.
-[Todd] I'll check you later.

45:37.542 --> 45:40.917
-[softly] But I have chess with Gary.
-Mm-mmm. Not today, you don't.

45:42.083 --> 45:43.083
[sighs]

45:43.167 --> 45:45.208
-[Cougars chattering, laughing]
-Sit.

45:48.125 --> 45:50.667
[cheering] Full set. Unbelievable.

45:51.250 --> 45:52.875
-Yeah. Cool.
-[inhales deeply]

45:52.958 --> 45:55.292
Say hi.
Jesus Christ, I feel like a ventriloquist.

45:55.792 --> 45:56.833
-Hi.
-[scoffs]

45:56.917 --> 45:58.833
-[jock 1] Hey, Todd.
-[laughs, grunts]

45:58.917 --> 45:59.917
[jock 1] Nice catch, bro.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.208
[Todd] Darby.
You lit that mat on fire. Seriously.

46:03.292 --> 46:05.125
-Welcome to the team.
-[laughing] Thanks.

46:05.208 --> 46:08.458
-Hey, Darby. Looking good.
-Oh, thanks.

46:08.542 --> 46:10.667
Aw! Look at you all flush with endorphins.

46:10.750 --> 46:13.833
This is probably the first time
you've experienced popularity, huh?

46:13.917 --> 46:17.750
Own it, girl. Also, smile?
Yeah, you have spinach in your teeth.

46:17.833 --> 46:19.833
-What?
-Phase one of my plan is complete.

46:19.917 --> 46:22.083
You've joined the team
and gained influence.

46:22.167 --> 46:23.167
Now on to phase two.

46:27.708 --> 46:28.875
That's phase two.

46:31.958 --> 46:32.958
Oh, my God.

46:33.792 --> 46:36.542
I swore I had a tampon in here.

46:36.625 --> 46:39.583
She did. I put it in your locker.
[whispering] You're welcome.

46:39.667 --> 46:41.875
I wore white jeans. Do you have anything?

46:41.958 --> 46:43.375
Still trans.

46:43.458 --> 46:44.917
Go on, this is your cue.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.292
-[Bree] Sorry, boo. I don't have any.
-[Taylor] Oh, my God. Come on.

46:51.625 --> 46:52.833
Here, Taylor.

46:56.042 --> 46:57.042
Thanks.

46:58.125 --> 47:01.083
[Capri] Retreat. Retreat!
Act natural. Come on.

47:03.458 --> 47:04.875
[Darby] Yeah.

47:05.500 --> 47:06.625
[clears throat]

47:07.583 --> 47:10.125
So, I guess we have to practice the stunt.

47:11.167 --> 47:13.500
You can come over tomorrow after school.

47:14.208 --> 47:15.625
Yeah, sounds good.

47:18.458 --> 47:21.833
I will see you then. I guess.

47:55.542 --> 47:56.875
[cheering, laughing]

48:00.333 --> 48:03.958
Why the sudden desire
to join cheer, Darby Harper?

48:04.042 --> 48:05.208
Whoa. What's happening?

48:05.292 --> 48:07.583
-She thinks you're an undercover narc.
-Like <i>21 Jump Street</i>.

48:07.667 --> 48:09.583
-She's clean.
-Nice.

48:09.667 --> 48:11.708
Uh-- Say something. Um, something good.

48:12.583 --> 48:14.042
Well, honestly, you guys,

48:14.125 --> 48:17.917
that recruitment skit that you guys did
in gym class really spoke to me.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.583
[exhales sharply] I wrote that.

48:20.250 --> 48:22.542
After I said,
"Let's write a script." [sighs]

48:22.625 --> 48:26.708
And I just thought, "Wow." [chuckles]
I mean, "I wish I had such cool friends."

48:26.792 --> 48:30.042
[laughs] Yeah, we're definitely
an upgrade from that weird donut kid.

48:30.125 --> 48:32.583
-Yeah. Are you dating the donut?
-Squash that. Now.

48:32.667 --> 48:34.792
[stammers]
No. No, I don't really know him.

48:34.875 --> 48:36.792
Ooh, I wonder how James is doing.

48:36.875 --> 48:38.583
Bitch, I will drown you in a toilet bowl

48:38.667 --> 48:40.667
if you think for one second
about dating Jamesy.

48:40.750 --> 48:42.542
I think he's coming back to school soon.

48:42.625 --> 48:45.792
It's gonna be so sad
seeing him without Capri.

48:45.875 --> 48:48.417
-I still can't believe that she's gone.
-Here's your in.

48:49.250 --> 48:51.625
Um, well,
isn't Capri's birthday coming up?

48:51.708 --> 48:54.792
Do you guys have, I don't know,
anything special planned for it?

48:54.875 --> 48:57.875
Well, she had this big Coachella-themed
party planned.

48:57.958 --> 49:00.250
-Yes, Bree. Keep going.
-It's canceled, obviously.

49:00.333 --> 49:02.833
-[sighs]
-Well, you know, what would be so cool--

49:02.917 --> 49:05.042
Okay, easy. [softly] Don't force it.

49:05.125 --> 49:08.167
Actually, you know what, never mind.
It's none of my business.

49:08.250 --> 49:10.083
I wasn't friends with her. I'm gonna go.

49:10.167 --> 49:12.000
Wait, wait. What were you gonna say?

49:12.667 --> 49:14.833
[chuckles] Well, wouldn't it be great

49:14.917 --> 49:16.917
if you guys did something
to celebrate her,

49:17.000 --> 49:19.958
and remember
all of her amazing qualities? Like--

49:20.042 --> 49:21.792
Being named after pants.

49:21.875 --> 49:24.000
Right. But, you know--

49:24.083 --> 49:26.750
There were so many things
about Capri, right? Like--

49:27.958 --> 49:32.000
I mean, she was, uh, pretty and--

49:32.083 --> 49:35.542
Oh! Bossy. Yeah, she was bossy.

49:35.625 --> 49:38.708
Well, anyway.
Wouldn't it be cool if you guys threw

49:38.792 --> 49:41.208
Capri's Sweet Seventeen party
in her honor?

49:41.292 --> 49:45.083
A birthday party for our dead best friend?

49:45.167 --> 49:47.667
[laughs] That seems kind of inappropriate.

49:47.750 --> 49:49.375
-Bad form.
-[Bree] Yeah. Super weird.

49:49.458 --> 49:50.792
Uh, followers! Instagram followers.

49:50.875 --> 49:55.833
Well, what if it was to support
accidental electrocution awareness?

49:55.917 --> 49:57.167
-[laughs] What?
-[Taylor] Huh?

49:57.250 --> 50:00.542
I mean, I'm sure it'd make the news
and draw national attention.

50:00.625 --> 50:01.750
Genius.

50:01.833 --> 50:04.042
"Hashtag Capri's Sweet Seventeen."

50:04.958 --> 50:08.583
A celebration of her life,
thrown by her three best friends. [laughs]

50:08.667 --> 50:10.833
Yeah, this could make you guys
legit influencers.

50:10.917 --> 50:11.917
[exhales deeply]

50:12.000 --> 50:14.583
Influencers for accidental
electrocution awareness, of course.

50:14.667 --> 50:16.833
-Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
-Electrical.

50:16.917 --> 50:18.833
-Yes!
-[grunts]

50:18.917 --> 50:21.083
-[Darby grunts] Oh, I-- Hi. Sorry.
-Uh. Hi. Hi.

50:21.167 --> 50:22.833
Jelly legs. Eat a banana.

50:22.917 --> 50:24.500
-I'm gonna stretch.
-Bye.

50:24.583 --> 50:25.583
Oops.

50:31.500 --> 50:32.500
We did it.

50:32.583 --> 50:38.042
Ugh. Honestly, I think the party will be
even more iconic now that I'm dead.

50:38.125 --> 50:40.583
Ooh, you know, we should
do something special

50:40.667 --> 50:42.292
at midnight to symbolize you passing on.

50:42.375 --> 50:45.042
Ooh! Like, uh, releasing a white dove
or something?

50:45.125 --> 50:46.417
-Oh.
-[Capri] That's fresh.

50:46.500 --> 50:49.208
Yeah, that's cool. I actually
haven't done that for anyone yet.

50:50.583 --> 50:51.583
You know,

50:51.667 --> 50:53.583
I used to think
you were such a stuck-up bitch,

50:53.667 --> 50:55.292
but you're actually kinda cool.

50:55.375 --> 50:56.417
[chuckles]

50:56.500 --> 50:58.042
You thought I was a stuck-up bitch?

50:58.125 --> 50:59.333
Oh, please.

50:59.417 --> 51:01.875
You acted like you were so edgy and cool,

51:01.958 --> 51:05.250
and everyone else was basic
and below you or something.

51:05.333 --> 51:06.417
[chuckles] What?

51:06.500 --> 51:09.042
Of course, that was before I knew
you were dealing with all this…

51:09.708 --> 51:10.708
dead people shit.

51:12.708 --> 51:14.333
Must be very isolating for you.

51:15.708 --> 51:20.875
Capri Donahue, did you just
express empathy for another person?

51:21.542 --> 51:25.333
[chuckles] Well, I didn't really
think about it before I died

51:25.417 --> 51:28.375
but being popular can be isolating too.

51:29.750 --> 51:30.917
Isn't that an oxymoron?

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
No.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.500
Imagine everyone has
these high expectations of you,

51:37.583 --> 51:39.250
and you don't wanna disappoint them,

51:39.333 --> 51:42.250
so you just keep all your imperfections
bottled up inside.

51:42.333 --> 51:44.208
You have imperfections?

51:44.292 --> 51:46.792
Well, not my looks
or personality in general, but…

51:47.875 --> 51:51.417
my mom used to say that I wasn't smart
and that I'd only get by on my looks.

51:54.542 --> 51:56.750
[chuckles] I've never told anyone that.

51:57.875 --> 52:00.333
Capri, I think you're smart.

52:00.958 --> 52:02.917
Like, maybe even dangerously so.

52:05.625 --> 52:07.042
Thanks.

52:07.125 --> 52:09.625
I just don't think your looks
are anything to write home about.

52:10.167 --> 52:11.917
-[scoffs]
-[phone buzzes, beeps]

52:13.125 --> 52:14.750
How are the numbers on the bikini selfie?

52:15.250 --> 52:17.292
-[Darby sighs]
-Did you Photoshop this?

52:17.375 --> 52:19.250
-No.
-I can teach you how to Facetune.

52:19.333 --> 52:20.542
-Okay. It's fine.
-[Darby] Why?

52:21.333 --> 52:23.042
Ooh! "Slay, Queen!

52:23.125 --> 52:27.083
You are the hottest girl
to ever walk the halls of FDHS."

52:28.292 --> 52:29.292

-[person] Whoo!

52:38.042 --> 52:40.167
[Taylor] Let's go Cougars!
Let's go, ladies!

52:40.250 --> 52:42.417
-Let's go! Come on!
-[Todd] Yeah!

52:43.292 --> 52:45.375
-Whoo!
-[cheering]

53:13.083 --> 53:14.417

Whoo!

53:43.708 --> 53:45.208
[cheering]

53:46.583 --> 53:50.500
I am accepted, admired, maybe even adored.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.125
People who couldn't pick me
out of a lineup a month ago

53:53.208 --> 53:54.792
now comment with things like--

53:54.875 --> 53:56.875
Fire emoji, fire emoji.

53:56.958 --> 53:58.167
Crown emoji.

53:58.250 --> 53:59.458
And--

53:59.542 --> 54:02.458
Dying! Heart eye emoji.

54:02.542 --> 54:03.583
And even--

54:03.667 --> 54:06.625
-Eggplant emoji.
-Water spray emoji.

54:07.458 --> 54:08.583
Any press is good press.

54:09.083 --> 54:13.833
Every like, every comment,
every regram is a rush of dopamine.

54:14.417 --> 54:16.250
I feel a certain sense of power.

54:16.750 --> 54:19.500
And on game nights, I feel extra alive.

54:19.583 --> 54:24.833
-Ladies and gentlemen!
-["Whoomp. There it is" playing]

54:24.917 --> 54:30.167
It's time to make the donut!

54:30.250 --> 54:33.000
Donut! Donut! Donut!

54:33.083 --> 54:34.875
Here we go! Here we go!

Go, Darby! Go, Darby!

54:46.292 --> 54:48.125
["Whoomp! There it is" continues]

55:01.417 --> 55:02.583
Here we go!

55:12.250 --> 55:13.708
[Darby] Wait, no!

55:14.625 --> 55:17.125
[Alex laughing]

55:17.208 --> 55:18.958
-Dude. [chuckles]
-[Alex] Hello.

55:19.042 --> 55:20.042
[laughs]

55:20.750 --> 55:22.542
-You got some moves, huh?
-Yeah, I do.

55:22.625 --> 55:23.708
[Alex chuckles]

55:23.792 --> 55:25.583
-[Darby chuckles] Yeah.
-[Alex] Yeah.

55:25.667 --> 55:27.208
[both laughing]

55:27.292 --> 55:29.583
Oh, my God.
I haven't laughed this hard in li--

55:30.417 --> 55:33.375
I've never laughed this hard.
[chuckles] My cheeks hurt.

55:33.458 --> 55:34.833
Wait, wait, your cheeks hurt?

55:34.917 --> 55:37.125
At least the padded icing
cushioned your fall.

55:37.208 --> 55:38.750
[Alex laughing] Okay.

55:43.458 --> 55:46.333
Look, Darby, there's something
I really wanted to tell you.

55:46.417 --> 55:48.417
[Todd] Hey, Darby. You coming to the lake?

55:48.500 --> 55:50.250
-[Darby] Oh, yeah.
-[Todd] Oh, awesome.

55:50.333 --> 55:51.833
-[Darby chuckles]
-[person] Awesome.

55:52.333 --> 55:53.958
-Sorry.
-[Alex] Don't be. [chuckles]

55:54.042 --> 55:56.083
I'm dying to go take
this stupid thing off anyway.

55:56.167 --> 56:00.417
But, uh, maybe we could
go get a coffee next week?

56:00.500 --> 56:02.542
How about Thursday, right after school?

56:02.625 --> 56:05.167
-Go to Indie Roasters? It's downtown.
-[Darby chuckles]

56:06.417 --> 56:08.500
-I'll be there.
-Okay.

56:08.583 --> 56:10.333
Cool, cool. Very cool.

56:11.625 --> 56:12.625
[Darby chuckles]

56:13.125 --> 56:14.375
[Todd] Okay, let's take another one.

56:14.458 --> 56:16.125
-[Bree] Okay, ready? Smile.
-[Todd] Let's go.

56:16.208 --> 56:19.625
You know you don't have to talk
to the mascot after the game ends, right?

56:19.708 --> 56:22.583
Oh, yeah. He was just seeing
if I wanted to grab a coffee next week.

56:22.667 --> 56:23.917
Could you imagine?

56:24.000 --> 56:26.917
Douglas The Donut takes you to Starbucks.

56:27.500 --> 56:29.167
-[Piper] What a scandal.
-[Taylor gasps]

56:29.250 --> 56:30.333
Oh, my God!

56:30.417 --> 56:32.375
My uncle said we can use his house
for the party.

56:32.458 --> 56:33.500
-[Todd] No way.
-Oh, my God.

56:33.583 --> 56:35.750
You know that giant glass house
on the lake?

56:35.833 --> 56:37.083
Wait, that's your uncle's house?

56:37.167 --> 56:40.083
Yeah. Her uncle invented
that crypto banking app, Money Grab.

56:40.167 --> 56:42.792
[sighs] It's an app that's like a bank

56:42.875 --> 56:46.292
but instead of going to an actual bank,
you go to the app and like grab money.

56:46.375 --> 56:48.167
No, Bree, it's an actual bank.

56:48.250 --> 56:50.042
It's just, like,
the money that isn't real.

56:50.125 --> 56:52.208
Anyway, it'll be sick for the party.

56:52.292 --> 56:53.542
Tell 'em how big it is.

56:53.625 --> 56:56.292
The chandelier has a chandelier.

56:56.375 --> 56:57.833
-Yeah.
-Guys, let's go to the lake.

56:57.917 --> 57:00.542
Let's pop some tops, okay? Right?

57:00.625 --> 57:03.917
Oh, Darby can't hang out
on Friday nights, remember?

57:04.000 --> 57:06.250
-Her daddy wants her home early.
-Yeah.

57:06.333 --> 57:08.458
[Bree] But the head
of the homecoming committee will be there.

57:08.542 --> 57:10.292
We can kiss her ass
for a queen nomination.

57:10.375 --> 57:11.375
It's gonna suck.

57:11.917 --> 57:13.458
-You should come.
-Uh--

57:13.542 --> 57:15.042
Don't you have work tonight?

57:15.125 --> 57:16.375
Isn't that your whole thing?

57:16.458 --> 57:17.792
-Please?
-Come on, Harper.

57:17.875 --> 57:19.208
Break the rules.

57:19.292 --> 57:20.792
-[Todd] Come on, Harper.
-[Piper] Do it.

57:20.875 --> 57:22.875
-[Taylor] It'll be fun.
-Okay. Just give me a sec.

57:22.958 --> 57:24.833
-I'm gonna call my dad, okay?
-[Todd] Awesome.

57:24.917 --> 57:26.917
-Whoo-hoo! Nice.
-Gotta get permission.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.667
-[Todd] Ooh!
-[Taylor] Okay.

57:28.750 --> 57:30.917
Hey, can you please tell the Deados
something came up

57:31.000 --> 57:32.917
-and I can't make it tonight?
-What?

57:33.000 --> 57:35.917
You're really gonna blow off the Deados
just so you can drink hard seltzer

57:36.000 --> 57:38.708
that literally tastes
like Strawberry Shortcake's butt crack?

57:38.792 --> 57:40.167
Come on. Please?

57:41.083 --> 57:44.167
I have literally never taken
a Friday off work before.

57:44.250 --> 57:45.625
We just won the game.

57:45.708 --> 57:47.667
I don't feel like hanging
with dead people tonight.

57:48.333 --> 57:49.333
No offense.

57:49.417 --> 57:52.042
Okay, well, I don't feel like hanging out
with dead people either.

57:52.125 --> 57:53.500
Then come with us.

57:55.375 --> 57:57.125
So I can hide in the bushes
like Michael Myers

57:57.208 --> 57:59.125
-and watch you guys have fun?
-[car horn honks]

57:59.208 --> 58:00.708
-No, thank you.
-[horn honks]

58:00.792 --> 58:02.125
-Come on, Harper!
-[Bree] Come on!

58:02.208 --> 58:03.208
[Darby] Coming!

58:03.292 --> 58:06.292
Did you hear that they're using
Taylor's uncle's mansion for the party?

58:06.375 --> 58:07.500
Great news, right?

58:08.167 --> 58:09.542
-Yay.
-[cheering]

58:09.625 --> 58:10.833
[Todd] There you are!

58:10.917 --> 58:12.500
-Whoo-hoo-hoo!
-[Taylor] Let's go.

58:12.583 --> 58:14.542
-[Bree] Party time! All right.
-[Todd] Let's go!

58:15.167 --> 58:17.833
I'll go back to being a mole person
after the party

58:17.917 --> 58:22.625
but until then, fooling all the normies
is actually kind of satisfying. [chuckles]

58:25.042 --> 58:28.000
Shoulders back, head up.

58:28.542 --> 58:32.292
Although, I won't deny the influencing
has become slightly intoxicating.

58:32.375 --> 58:35.667
I mean, I had single-handedly
started a fashion trend.

58:41.958 --> 58:44.417
Me. The invisible girl.

58:44.500 --> 58:46.583
The girl no one even realized existed.

58:50.125 --> 58:51.625
[cheering, laughing]

58:53.542 --> 58:54.542
[jock] Hey, Darbs.

58:54.625 --> 58:56.375
Are you stoked for the game on Friday?

58:56.458 --> 58:57.458
[Capri] "Darbs"?

58:57.542 --> 59:00.292
I'll be more stoked if you guys
can score a touchdown this time.

59:00.375 --> 59:01.833
-[gasp, chuckle]
-[Todd] Oh, oh.

59:04.458 --> 59:05.458
[camera shutter clicks]

59:08.750 --> 59:11.000
Okay, the tent is arriving
Saturday morning.

59:11.083 --> 59:14.000
DJ Linky Dinky Dog will create
a collaborative playlist on Spotify

59:14.083 --> 59:15.625
so we can all add our favorite songs.

59:16.208 --> 59:19.250
-Uh, Capri's favorite songs.
-[Taylor] Got it.

59:19.333 --> 59:23.167
Uh, Todd is bringing the kegs,
and where are we on the dove?

59:23.250 --> 59:25.583
Oh, my mom ordered us one on Amazon.

59:25.667 --> 59:28.333
She cried when I told her your plan
to release it at midnight.

59:28.417 --> 59:31.083
Mmm, it's so poetic. Genius really.

59:31.167 --> 59:32.500
-[clears throat]
-[Darby] Well,

59:32.583 --> 59:34.250
I feel like I can't take credit for that.

59:34.333 --> 59:36.333
I think it's something Capri
would've come up with.

59:36.417 --> 59:39.375
[scoffs] Uh, no.
She really wasn't that deep.

59:39.458 --> 59:40.917
-What the f--
-[Darby] Oh, look--

59:41.000 --> 59:43.875
Look the-- the editor sent me
the final cut of the promo.

59:43.958 --> 59:45.792
-[Taylor gasps] Ooh.
-I'm gonna post it tonight.

59:46.375 --> 59:50.208
[promo narrator] <i>This Saturday,
Capri Donahue's Coachella-themed R.I.P.</i>

59:50.292 --> 59:52.042
<i>Rest In Party.</i>

59:53.042 --> 59:56.125
<i>A party so epic
they'll hear it in the afterlife.</i>

59:56.708 --> 59:59.292
<i>Hashtag electrocution awareness week.</i>

59:59.375 --> 1:00:00.792
<i>Follow us on Insta.</i>

1:00:01.667 --> 1:00:02.500
<i>Party on.</i>

1:00:04.875 --> 1:00:06.292
Iconic. [chuckles]

1:00:06.375 --> 1:00:07.625
Well, I have chills.

1:00:07.708 --> 1:00:11.083
It's literally the best memorial party
promo I have ever seen.

1:00:11.167 --> 1:00:12.208
Right?

1:00:12.292 --> 1:00:13.292
Oh, my God.

1:00:13.792 --> 1:00:14.958
-Oh, my God!
-What? What?

1:00:15.042 --> 1:00:17.583
They just posted
homecoming queen nominations.

1:00:17.667 --> 1:00:19.417
Congrats, girl!

1:00:19.500 --> 1:00:20.792
-[screams]
-[Darby, Capri] What?

1:00:20.875 --> 1:00:23.500
-Uh, no, no, no. That can't be right.
-Oh, my God. You'll totally win.

1:00:23.583 --> 1:00:25.958
Especially because your party
is gonna be the coolest of all time.

1:00:26.042 --> 1:00:28.292
Oh, is it your party now?
Is that what we're calling it?

1:00:28.375 --> 1:00:30.458
[chuckles] My party?
No, guys, it's not my party.

1:00:30.542 --> 1:00:31.542
It's Capri's party.

1:00:31.625 --> 1:00:34.375
-Totally. Of course.
-Yeah, right.

1:00:34.458 --> 1:00:35.458
Not really.

1:00:36.417 --> 1:00:39.500
But I mean,
it's kind of become your party.

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:42.125
It was your idea,
and you planned the whole thing.

1:00:42.208 --> 1:00:44.000
No. My idea, Taylor.

1:00:44.083 --> 1:00:46.125
-I planned the whole thing!
-Shh!

1:00:46.208 --> 1:00:49.958
Sure, sure.
But it's all for Capri, remember?

1:00:50.042 --> 1:00:52.833
Just tell them I'm here.
I'm so sick of being invisible!

1:00:52.917 --> 1:00:53.958
[electricity crackles]

1:00:54.042 --> 1:00:55.208
[stammers]

1:00:55.292 --> 1:00:57.000
-[Darby] Uh--
-Um, ow.

1:00:57.083 --> 1:00:58.083
-It was a bee.
-Really?

1:00:58.167 --> 1:00:59.625
-It was a bee.
-Did you just do that?

1:00:59.708 --> 1:01:00.792
-[Darby] Yeah.
-You wanna go?

1:01:00.875 --> 1:01:02.625
[Darby] No, I got it.
It was buzzing around.

1:01:02.708 --> 1:01:03.833
-[chuckles]
-[Taylor] Okay.

1:01:03.917 --> 1:01:06.333
You guys should go to the locker room.
I'm gonna warm up.

1:01:06.417 --> 1:01:08.833
Warm up? We just finished practice.

1:01:09.417 --> 1:01:12.250
You don't make it to Nationals
by losing all your warmth, Bree.

1:01:12.917 --> 1:01:13.917
You're weird.

1:01:14.708 --> 1:01:16.292
-But so right.
-Yeah, I am right.

1:01:16.375 --> 1:01:17.375
Whatever. Okay. Bye.

1:01:17.458 --> 1:01:19.167
-Bye. [chuckles]
-[Bree] Goodbye.

1:01:19.250 --> 1:01:20.250
Bye.

1:01:20.833 --> 1:01:22.417
-You're my hero.
-Oh.

1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.292
[Darby] Are you trying to blow my cover?

1:01:28.375 --> 1:01:30.167
This party's supposed to be my moment.

1:01:30.250 --> 1:01:31.917
You've hijacked it!
It's all about you now!

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:33.000
What? No, it's not.

1:01:33.083 --> 1:01:35.208
Capri, there's literally gonna be
a 40-foot projection

1:01:35.292 --> 1:01:37.000
of your face in the night sky.

1:01:37.083 --> 1:01:38.167
Like a friggin' Bat-Signal.

1:01:38.250 --> 1:01:41.417
Yeah, which the homecoming committee
will probably give you credit for.

1:01:41.917 --> 1:01:44.625
I'm not really gonna be homecoming queen.
It's probably just a joke,

1:01:44.708 --> 1:01:46.917
and they're gonna
pour pig's blood on me or something.

1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:48.417
Ew.

1:01:48.917 --> 1:01:51.125
Look, I know it sucks
for you not to be here

1:01:51.208 --> 1:01:52.875
but there's really no need to be jealous--

1:01:52.958 --> 1:01:55.417
No, I'm not jealous.
Don't flatter yourself.

1:01:56.292 --> 1:01:57.917
I'm sleeping at my house this week.

1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:00.917
Good luck picking out a homecoming dress
without me to do it for you.

1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:02.583
[whooshing]

1:02:04.250 --> 1:02:05.250
[sighs]

1:02:07.208 --> 1:02:08.208
[Darby] What is it, Gary?

1:02:08.292 --> 1:02:09.708
It's my buddy, Mel.

1:02:09.792 --> 1:02:11.833
He came to see you Friday night,
you weren't there,

1:02:11.917 --> 1:02:13.792
and he's-- he's in a bad way, Darby.

1:02:13.875 --> 1:02:16.750
You know. He says he doesn't feel right.
It's unnatural.

1:02:16.833 --> 1:02:18.875
He's really ready to move on.

1:02:18.958 --> 1:02:22.167
Okay, well, I'm not the border patrol
for the afterlife.

1:02:22.250 --> 1:02:23.250
He can go on his own.

1:02:23.333 --> 1:02:24.667
'Course he can, but-but--

1:02:24.750 --> 1:02:27.375
See, he needs you to get a--
a message to his kid first.

1:02:27.458 --> 1:02:30.458
He wants to tell him that he's sorry
he didn't accept him as a gay.

1:02:30.542 --> 1:02:32.125
He's not a gay. He's gay.

1:02:32.208 --> 1:02:33.583
Yes, my son, Allen. He's gay.

1:02:33.667 --> 1:02:35.458
And I love him anyway and his husband,

1:02:35.542 --> 1:02:37.583
and I think they're gonna be
great parents.

1:02:37.667 --> 1:02:38.667
Like he said.

1:02:39.917 --> 1:02:41.250
[sighs]

1:02:41.333 --> 1:02:43.792
Gosh, I'm sorry I wasn't there, Mel.

1:02:43.875 --> 1:02:45.500
-[student] Great practice, Darbs.
-Yeah,

1:02:45.583 --> 1:02:46.875
you too, dude. [chuckles]

1:02:48.083 --> 1:02:49.083
Look. [clears throat]

1:02:49.167 --> 1:02:52.042
Come see me Friday night.
I'll be there. I'll help you, okay?

1:02:52.125 --> 1:02:53.458
-Okay.
-[Darby] Promise.

1:02:53.542 --> 1:02:55.042
-Thank you, Darby.
-Thank you, Darby.

1:03:00.958 --> 1:03:02.417
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey.

1:03:02.500 --> 1:03:05.917
-Take it you're not staying for dinner?
-Uh, no. I gotta go to James's.

1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:07.083
Oh.

1:03:07.167 --> 1:03:10.833
Honey, listen, I am glad
that you're making friends this year.

1:03:10.917 --> 1:03:12.208
But is everything okay?

1:03:12.875 --> 1:03:17.000
I mean… [sighs] …you just don't
seem like yourself anymore.

1:03:17.083 --> 1:03:19.708
God, Dad. I mean,
you pressure me to get a social life,

1:03:19.792 --> 1:03:21.958
and then you give me crap when I have one?

1:03:22.042 --> 1:03:23.458
-Make up your mind.
-Okay.

1:03:24.333 --> 1:03:25.583
[chuckles] That's valid.

1:03:26.250 --> 1:03:28.167
But, honey, I'm just checking in on you.

1:03:28.250 --> 1:03:30.583
Well, you don't have
to worry about me, 'kay?

1:03:30.667 --> 1:03:32.083
I'm fine, really.

1:03:32.167 --> 1:03:33.667
[chuckles] Same old Darby.

1:03:35.500 --> 1:03:38.917
Oh, and can I get a studio lighting kit
for my birthday?

1:03:39.417 --> 1:03:42.292
The lamps in my room are a little,
like, warm and cozy. It's gross.

1:03:42.375 --> 1:03:43.958
-Mmm.
-[Darby] You know?

1:03:44.042 --> 1:03:45.708
Anyway, bye.

1:03:45.792 --> 1:03:46.917
Bye.

1:03:47.750 --> 1:03:49.833
Yep, same old Darby.

1:03:51.042 --> 1:03:52.042
[sighs]

1:03:52.792 --> 1:03:54.042
[bike bell ringing]

1:03:58.583 --> 1:04:01.583
Did you know that octopus
have three brains?

1:04:01.667 --> 1:04:03.875
Um, wrong.

1:04:03.958 --> 1:04:05.792
-What do you mean?
-I'm not-- I mean, wrong!

1:04:05.875 --> 1:04:07.167
They have nine brains.

1:04:07.250 --> 1:04:09.333
Come on, man. The test is next week.

1:04:09.417 --> 1:04:11.042
-Oh.
-[chuckles]

1:04:11.125 --> 1:04:13.250
Hey, uh, look what I found the other day.

1:04:13.333 --> 1:04:14.333
[Darby] Mmm?

1:04:15.792 --> 1:04:17.750
-[chuckles]
-Look at this. Our, uh… [laughs]

1:04:17.833 --> 1:04:19.958
…sixth-grade field trip
to the planetarium.

1:04:20.042 --> 1:04:21.375
-Oh, wow.
-[chuckles]

1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:23.208
Harper and Harris.

1:04:23.292 --> 1:04:25.292
[James chuckles]
I thought you were so cool.

1:04:25.375 --> 1:04:27.750
What? Seriously?

1:04:28.333 --> 1:04:30.375
Yeah, you were so different
from everyone else.

1:04:34.125 --> 1:04:39.125
[sighs] It's going to be so weird to go
back to school without Capri tomorrow.

1:04:40.292 --> 1:04:41.292
[Darby sighs]

1:04:42.167 --> 1:04:45.042
Did you hear about that idiotic
Sweet Seventeen party for her?

1:04:45.125 --> 1:04:49.375
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Think I heard someone talking about that.

1:04:49.458 --> 1:04:52.583
Good to know Taylor, Bree and Piper
are so desperate for attention

1:04:52.667 --> 1:04:55.375
that they're willing
to whore out Capri's memory to get it.

1:04:57.042 --> 1:04:59.000
But isn't it for a good cause?

1:04:59.083 --> 1:05:00.833
Accidental electrocution awareness?

1:05:01.667 --> 1:05:03.208
Which one of those morons
came up with that?

1:05:03.292 --> 1:05:04.292
[chuckles]

1:05:05.250 --> 1:05:07.625
-Oh, c-cool tree house.
-Yeah.

1:05:08.125 --> 1:05:09.333
Wanna come check it out?

1:05:13.750 --> 1:05:14.750
Whoa.

1:05:15.750 --> 1:05:17.833
I haven't been up here since…

1:05:24.042 --> 1:05:27.542
[Darby] I didn't wanna leave my room
for months after my mom died.

1:05:28.667 --> 1:05:29.667
I just…

1:05:30.167 --> 1:05:33.667
I felt like if I just returned
to regular life

1:05:34.667 --> 1:05:36.917
and ignored the fact
that she wasn't there anymore,

1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:40.208
it'd be like living a lie or something.

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.125
But it does get easier. It does.

1:05:44.625 --> 1:05:46.417
And I know you can do this.

1:05:46.500 --> 1:05:47.500
Thanks.

1:05:48.792 --> 1:05:49.792
You really get it.

1:05:53.042 --> 1:05:54.750
Why's he looking at me like that?

1:05:54.833 --> 1:05:56.208
[whispers] What's going on?

1:05:59.833 --> 1:06:02.042
Darby, will you come to school
with me tomorrow?

1:06:03.042 --> 1:06:05.333
U-Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'll be there.

1:06:05.417 --> 1:06:08.958
No, I-- I mean, can I-- can I pick you up?

1:06:09.667 --> 1:06:11.875
It's gonna be tough for me
to face without Capri there

1:06:11.958 --> 1:06:14.583
and, you know,
I could really use someone by my side.

1:06:17.625 --> 1:06:20.917
Sure, sure.
I don't see why not. [chuckles]

1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:22.333
Thanks, Darby.

1:06:23.792 --> 1:06:25.250
-[both chuckle]
-[Darby] Oh.

1:06:26.583 --> 1:06:29.083
[sniffs] Your hair smells so good.

1:06:29.875 --> 1:06:32.042
Thanks, it's shampoo. I gotta go.

1:06:32.125 --> 1:06:33.125
It's getting late.

1:06:33.208 --> 1:06:34.208
-All right.
-Yeah.

1:06:34.292 --> 1:06:35.667
-See you tomorrow?
-Sure.

1:06:35.750 --> 1:06:38.083
-Be careful on the way down.
-I'll just leap down.

1:06:38.167 --> 1:06:39.500
-Need help?
-No, I got it.

1:06:39.583 --> 1:06:41.042
[crash]

1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:47.125
[sighs] It's just some environmentally
conscious carpooling. [chuckles]

1:06:48.292 --> 1:06:51.958
You know, Capri will probably thank me
for being there to support him.

1:06:52.042 --> 1:06:53.042
[toilet flushes]

1:06:53.125 --> 1:06:54.833
[Capri] <i>I will drown you in a toilet bowl</i>

1:06:54.917 --> 1:06:57.000
<i>if you think for one second
about dating Jamesy.</i>

1:07:01.083 --> 1:07:02.875
[Dad] Gonna introduce me
to your boyfriend?

1:07:02.958 --> 1:07:04.208
What? Who told you that?

1:07:06.250 --> 1:07:08.000
No, no. That's just my biology partner.

1:07:08.083 --> 1:07:12.083
Okay. Well, boyfriend, biology partner,
whatever you kids call it.

1:07:18.917 --> 1:07:20.333
Time to face the music.

1:07:21.667 --> 1:07:23.292
Okay, well, see you in bio.

1:07:23.375 --> 1:07:25.125
Hang on. Will you walk with me?

1:07:26.083 --> 1:07:27.333
Oh, no.

1:07:27.833 --> 1:07:28.833
Sure, James.

1:07:34.458 --> 1:07:37.542
-[student 1] Oh, ho ho!
-[student 2] James Harris is back.

1:07:37.625 --> 1:07:39.833
How'd Darby Harper manage to pull him

1:07:39.917 --> 1:07:41.958
before the bell even rang
on his first day back?

1:07:42.042 --> 1:07:43.958
[student 3] Are they, like, together now?

1:07:44.042 --> 1:07:45.042
James.

1:07:46.417 --> 1:07:48.833
[jock] Well, that's gotta be
the world's fastest rebound.

1:07:48.917 --> 1:07:51.667
James. [chuckles] Welcome back, brother.

1:07:53.250 --> 1:07:56.542
Nothing to see here, folks.
Just me and James Harris.

1:07:57.208 --> 1:07:58.917
Just me and the boy Blake Shelton called,

1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.250
"A talented guy
I should have turned my chair for."

1:08:01.750 --> 1:08:04.458
Who, I guess, has a crush on me now?
[breathes shakily]

1:08:04.542 --> 1:08:06.792
Nothing out of the ordinary
going on here. [chuckles]

1:08:11.792 --> 1:08:13.417
[student 4] They're holding hands.

1:08:13.500 --> 1:08:15.333
Capri Donahue's gonna drown me
in a toilet bowl.

1:08:15.417 --> 1:08:16.542
[student 5] What?

1:08:17.292 --> 1:08:19.250
So, are you and James, like, a thing now?

1:08:19.333 --> 1:08:22.292
'Cause everyone is saying that
you made out in the hallway this morning.

1:08:22.375 --> 1:08:23.875
No. [sighs] No, we didn't.

1:08:23.958 --> 1:08:26.250
His hand just brushed mine
for a few seconds.

1:08:26.333 --> 1:08:28.292
He's having a hard time
being back without Capri.

1:08:28.375 --> 1:08:30.708
Oh, yes, poor James. The wounded bird.

1:08:30.792 --> 1:08:32.542
Yeah, I would be careful.

1:08:32.625 --> 1:08:35.250
He's so codependent
and definitely on the rebound.

1:08:35.333 --> 1:08:36.958
And morally, it's gross.

1:08:37.042 --> 1:08:39.708
Totally.
Capri's not even cold in her grave yet.

1:08:39.792 --> 1:08:42.208
You guys, it was just
a one-time ride to school.

1:08:42.292 --> 1:08:43.833
-[car horn honks]
-[James] Darby.

1:08:43.917 --> 1:08:45.583
You, uh-- You want a ride home?

1:08:45.667 --> 1:08:47.542
[Darby] No! No, thanks.

1:08:47.625 --> 1:08:51.083
I'm just gonna get my cardio in,
you know? [chuckles]

1:08:51.167 --> 1:08:52.458
All right, well, come by later.

1:08:53.083 --> 1:08:54.083
Wrote a song for you.

1:08:54.792 --> 1:08:56.625
-There's a song.
-Oh, my God.

1:08:56.708 --> 1:08:58.375
Gotta run. You know?

1:08:59.333 --> 1:09:01.000
[Taylor] She's running in that?

1:09:01.083 --> 1:09:02.417
She doesn't live close.

1:09:03.458 --> 1:09:04.625
[sighs] It's Thursday.

1:09:05.125 --> 1:09:06.917
Only two more days till the party.

1:09:08.125 --> 1:09:09.125
[sighs]

1:09:10.375 --> 1:09:12.083
I can lay low until…

1:09:12.875 --> 1:09:15.458
[gasps] Shit, it's Thursday.

1:09:41.208 --> 1:09:42.208
[sighs]

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:46.708
[Mel] I mean, I used to have crates
of 12-inch vinyl in my den.

1:09:46.792 --> 1:09:50.167
And you could read the liner notes,
you could touch 'em, you could feel 'em.

1:09:50.250 --> 1:09:51.875
But… [stammers] …the music cloud.

1:09:52.375 --> 1:09:53.792
-Where is it? I don't get it.
-Ha!

1:09:53.875 --> 1:09:56.167
Oh, my God! Can you guys stop?

1:09:56.667 --> 1:09:58.667
I cannot believe I'm spending
my junior year

1:09:58.750 --> 1:10:00.875
listening to some dead boomers

1:10:00.958 --> 1:10:06.042
talking about newspapers and typewriters
and network television.

1:10:06.125 --> 1:10:08.333
Then why don't you just
make up with Darby then?

1:10:09.583 --> 1:10:11.083
I mean, so what?

1:10:11.167 --> 1:10:13.417
She's the Homeroom Queen
and you're not. Big deal.

1:10:13.500 --> 1:10:15.000
That's, uh, Homecoming Queen.

1:10:15.083 --> 1:10:17.083
-Thank you.
-[Gary sighs] Listen, Capri,

1:10:17.167 --> 1:10:18.917
you should be very proud of yourself.

1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:22.958
You were able to pry Darby
out of her shell when no one else could.

1:10:23.042 --> 1:10:26.125
Yeah, well, now she's taking
the attention and credit for my party!

1:10:26.208 --> 1:10:27.208
-Yeah.
-[sighs]

1:10:27.708 --> 1:10:30.500
My sister-in-law, Rose,
sang at my funeral.

1:10:30.583 --> 1:10:33.417
All anybody could talk about
was how great Rose sounded.

1:10:33.500 --> 1:10:35.083
What a great voice Rose had.

1:10:35.167 --> 1:10:37.667
At my funeral!
And you know what they said about me?

1:10:37.750 --> 1:10:38.958
"He's looked better."

1:10:39.042 --> 1:10:41.583
-[gasps] The audacity!
-[Gary] Guys, guys, guys.

1:10:41.667 --> 1:10:43.167
Who cares?

1:10:43.250 --> 1:10:44.458
You're dead.

1:10:45.583 --> 1:10:47.458
You're throwing a temper tantrum

1:10:47.542 --> 1:10:50.958
about a party in a dimension
that you no longer exist in.

1:10:51.458 --> 1:10:53.042
Do you know how crazy that is?

1:10:53.125 --> 1:10:54.750
Well, then what's the point?

1:10:55.917 --> 1:10:57.333
What's my purpose?

1:10:57.417 --> 1:11:00.333
Well, you're gonna find that out
on the other side.

1:11:01.083 --> 1:11:03.708
I mean, listen, I have a reason
to stick around, you know?

1:11:03.792 --> 1:11:05.250
I wanna be with Linda.

1:11:05.333 --> 1:11:08.042
But you, you're so young and whip-smart.

1:11:08.125 --> 1:11:09.708
You got your whole death in front of you.

1:11:09.792 --> 1:11:12.417
Why would you wanna stay here
and be invisible?

1:11:13.125 --> 1:11:16.000
You just have to get the heck out of here.

1:11:19.583 --> 1:11:20.583
Thanks, Gary.

1:11:21.250 --> 1:11:22.250
Okay.

1:11:24.208 --> 1:11:26.125
She has a lot of electricity.

1:11:26.208 --> 1:11:28.417
[smacks lips]
You know that's how she died, right?

1:11:28.500 --> 1:11:29.625
[bell rings]

1:11:29.708 --> 1:11:31.333
[Darby] Hey, Alex.

1:11:31.417 --> 1:11:33.917
[sighs] Look, I'm so sorry
about missing our coffee date.

1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:35.083
It's okay.

1:11:35.167 --> 1:11:36.417
Uh, you're busy.

1:11:36.917 --> 1:11:38.833
I hear you're dating James Harris now.

1:11:38.917 --> 1:11:41.417
Oh, no. No, I'm not dating James.

1:11:41.500 --> 1:11:43.000
You could have just texted me.

1:11:43.083 --> 1:11:45.000
I was waiting like 20 minutes.

1:11:46.292 --> 1:11:48.125
[Darby] Uh, look,
I gotta go but I really do--

1:11:48.208 --> 1:11:49.542
Talk to you later. Right.

1:11:54.542 --> 1:11:57.125
[Darby] Hey, Capri. H-How was your Dad's?

1:11:57.208 --> 1:11:58.208
Not great.

1:11:58.292 --> 1:12:01.125
My mom turned my bedroom
into her personal yoga studio.

1:12:01.625 --> 1:12:02.625
-[Darby] Mmm.
-[Capri] So--

1:12:02.708 --> 1:12:04.917
Okay, well, I-I kind of wanna talk to you.

1:12:05.583 --> 1:12:06.583
[Capri] Yeah, sure.

1:12:07.958 --> 1:12:09.375
-[sighs]
-Okay, I'm glad you're here.

1:12:09.458 --> 1:12:11.583
-There's something I need to tell you.
-Me too.

1:12:11.667 --> 1:12:14.333
I wanted to apologize about
overreacting about the party.

1:12:14.833 --> 1:12:18.542
I've decided that I am proud of your--
our Homecoming nomination.

1:12:18.625 --> 1:12:19.750
I just had to remind myself

1:12:19.833 --> 1:12:21.917
that I'm the Michelangelo
behind your David, you know?

1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:23.875
Great. Well, I have something to tell you,

1:12:23.958 --> 1:12:26.458
but before you freak out,
I want you to let me explain.

1:12:26.542 --> 1:12:28.833
-It's about me and--
-[jock] Good to have you back.

1:12:28.917 --> 1:12:31.042
[gasps] James. Oh, he's at school today.

1:12:31.125 --> 1:12:32.917
Look at him, he's so cute.
Look, he's glowing.

1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.417
[Darby chuckles] Okay, Capri.
Listen to me, okay?

1:12:35.500 --> 1:12:37.833
There's been a misunderstanding.
You'll think it's funny--

1:12:37.917 --> 1:12:40.292
-There you are. [chuckles, grunts]
-[Darby stammers]

1:12:40.375 --> 1:12:42.458
-I've been looking all over for you.
-[Darby chuckles]

1:12:42.542 --> 1:12:43.958
This too much?

1:12:44.042 --> 1:12:45.833
What the hell is going on?

1:12:45.917 --> 1:12:47.792
[Darby] Uh, okay. How am I gonna do this?

1:12:47.875 --> 1:12:48.958
All right, James.

1:12:49.042 --> 1:12:52.333
I-I can't stop thinking about you
since the other night at my place.

1:12:52.417 --> 1:12:54.625
-Did you hook up with James?
-No.

1:12:54.708 --> 1:12:58.000
I know we both felt something,
and yesterday when you held my hand--

1:12:58.083 --> 1:12:59.458
-You what?
-[Darby] No, no.

1:12:59.542 --> 1:13:01.958
No, I didn't hold your hand,
you held mine.

1:13:02.042 --> 1:13:03.708
-You slut!
-[electricity crackles]

1:13:03.792 --> 1:13:06.875
-[grunts]
-I felt this spark and--

1:13:06.958 --> 1:13:09.500
[Darby pants, yawns]

1:13:09.583 --> 1:13:11.833
-Just really ti-- I'm exhausted. Yeah.
-Are you okay?

1:13:11.917 --> 1:13:12.917
[Darby] Whoo!

1:13:13.458 --> 1:13:16.042
I know I'm still grieving Capri.
But it just--

1:13:16.125 --> 1:13:17.708
-It just felt good to finally feel…
-Stop.

1:13:17.792 --> 1:13:21.083
…a moment of happiness again,
and it's been so long, and I--

1:13:21.667 --> 1:13:24.042
I think she'd want that.

1:13:24.542 --> 1:13:26.417
No, I really don't think she would.

1:13:26.500 --> 1:13:27.833
[sighs]

1:13:27.917 --> 1:13:29.917
[Darby] Uh, sorry, James.

1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:31.792
I gotta get to class. Have a good day.

1:13:35.208 --> 1:13:38.083
Oh, my God. How many times
do I have to tell you?

1:13:38.167 --> 1:13:39.500
Nothing happened.

1:13:39.583 --> 1:13:40.750
You won't admit it.

1:13:40.833 --> 1:13:42.167
-Not even now.
-Admit what?

1:13:42.250 --> 1:13:45.125
Admit that you love my life so much
that you want to be me.

1:13:45.208 --> 1:13:46.750
I am nothing like you, okay?

1:13:46.833 --> 1:13:48.458
You don't have to worry
about me and James.

1:13:48.542 --> 1:13:51.458
Oh, my God. What is this?
<i>The Young and the Restless</i>?

1:13:52.417 --> 1:13:53.708
I'm outta here.

1:13:53.792 --> 1:13:56.667
[Capri] I'm not worried about James.
He's just trauma-bonding.

1:13:56.750 --> 1:14:01.167
You don't think in a million years
he would actually like you, do you?

1:14:01.250 --> 1:14:03.542
[scoffs] Well, that's a little harsh.

1:14:03.625 --> 1:14:05.375
You're not even a real person!

1:14:05.875 --> 1:14:07.667
I created you! I made you!

1:14:07.750 --> 1:14:11.042
I dressed you up and told you how to act
so you could be popular.

1:14:11.125 --> 1:14:12.208
But deep down,

1:14:13.333 --> 1:14:16.250
you know you're just a freak
that sees dead people.

1:14:17.833 --> 1:14:20.042
Maybe that's why your mom
didn't wanna come and see you.

1:14:22.417 --> 1:14:25.208
Hey, ladies. It's my big bon voyage.

1:14:25.292 --> 1:14:27.917
E-Everybody out! All of you!

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:29.042
[Mel] Not optimum.

her entire life on superficial bullshit.

1:14:41.500 --> 1:14:42.500
I built you.

1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000
I can just as easily tear you down.

1:14:45.500 --> 1:14:48.042
Don't even think of going
to my party tomorrow night.

1:14:48.125 --> 1:14:51.625
Well, you forgot one vital difference
between us, babe.

1:14:52.292 --> 1:14:53.542

1:14:54.042 --> 1:14:57.083
[scoffs] I'm not spooked by some

1:14:57.167 --> 1:14:59.167
I'll go to that party
if I damn well please.

1:14:59.250 --> 1:15:01.042

And I am definitely not going anywhere

1:15:17.292 --> 1:15:18.583
Hey, kid. [chuckles]

1:15:19.375 --> 1:15:21.208
What? School on Saturday? [chuckles]

1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:24.917
Word on the street is, uh,

1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.750
you had a little freak out last night,
and I thought I'd check on you.

1:15:27.833 --> 1:15:29.042
I've been looking for you.

1:15:30.333 --> 1:15:31.792
I'm sorry, but I--

1:15:32.375 --> 1:15:33.958
I can't talk to you anymore, Gary.

1:15:34.042 --> 1:15:35.875
I just wanna be normal.

1:15:37.167 --> 1:15:39.458
Oh, Darby, don't you think you're normal?

1:15:40.125 --> 1:15:41.125
Uh…

1:15:42.125 --> 1:15:43.792
To clarify, I wanna be

1:15:43.875 --> 1:15:46.542
the-girl-who-doesn't-talk-to-dead-people
version of normal.

1:15:46.625 --> 1:15:47.625
How about that?

1:15:47.708 --> 1:15:50.750
Well, honey, you know, but that's--
that's kind of what makes you, you.

1:15:50.833 --> 1:15:53.542
Have you maybe talked to Capri about this?

1:15:53.625 --> 1:15:55.125
Maybe a friend your age could help--

1:15:55.208 --> 1:15:56.792
I'm not talking to Capri.

1:15:57.417 --> 1:15:59.000
She's not my friend. She never was.

1:15:59.083 --> 1:16:01.125
She just used me like a pawn.

1:16:02.833 --> 1:16:05.083
Well, yeah, I guess…

1:16:06.333 --> 1:16:08.750
I guess, uh, that's one way
of looking at it.

1:16:08.833 --> 1:16:11.708
But-- You know, but from a different
point of view,

1:16:11.792 --> 1:16:15.250
maybe she's the one who opened you up
to a whole new world of possibilities.

1:16:15.333 --> 1:16:17.417
She didn't do anything for me.

1:16:17.500 --> 1:16:20.000
She's just another loser Stayer
who can't move on.

1:16:20.708 --> 1:16:21.708
Oh.

1:16:23.958 --> 1:16:26.667

Can you take a drive with me, please?

1:17:04.125 --> 1:17:06.167
I'm freaking out right now.
This is gonna sound crazy,

1:17:06.250 --> 1:17:08.708
but I feel like Capri
is communicating with me.

1:17:08.792 --> 1:17:10.833
Like today, her picture
fell off my dresser,

1:17:10.917 --> 1:17:13.708
and, I don't know, the TV turned on
without me even touching it,

1:17:13.792 --> 1:17:16.417
and it was playing the news story
about the party tonight! And I--

1:17:16.500 --> 1:17:18.917
-I-I swear it happened.
-Oh, I'm sure it did.

1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:20.417

Also, I'm sorry, Darby.

1:17:30.625 --> 1:17:32.458
I don't think I'm ready
to be in a relationship.

1:17:32.542 --> 1:17:35.958
Oh, thank God that you told me that.

1:17:36.042 --> 1:17:39.042
Because I-I was thinking something else
was happening.

1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:42.708
But I hope we can still be friends.

1:17:43.292 --> 1:17:45.708
Yeah. Yeah, of course, James.

1:17:45.792 --> 1:17:47.333
I-I appreciate your honesty.

1:17:48.042 --> 1:17:49.417
My heart will go on.

1:17:50.375 --> 1:17:51.375

1:17:51.958 --> 1:17:55.208

and I for real got broken up with.

[pop music playing]

[Darby] This is not good.
This is very not good.

1:18:03.125 --> 1:18:05.458
James, I thought you were protesting this.

1:18:05.542 --> 1:18:08.333
Taylor, Piper and Bree are using
Capri's death to up their social status.

-It's sick, remember?
-I don't care about them!

1:18:10.667 --> 1:18:12.333
Okay? I wanna say goodbye to Capri.

Well, well, if it isn't the happy couple.

1:18:15.583 --> 1:18:16.792
I'm here for Capri.

Not to promote myself under the guise
of some bogus awareness campaign.

1:18:20.167 --> 1:18:23.042
Sure it's not to ruin another party
with an acoustic guitar?

campaign your new girlfriend came up with?

came together.

But, I mean, none of us are--
are normal, really.

1:22:44.333 --> 1:22:49.250
We're all flawed and insecure
and beautiful and ugly--

1:22:49.833 --> 1:22:51.542
-You're not ugly.
-Oh, you either.

1:22:51.625 --> 1:22:54.250
I couldn't see that from inside
my closed-minded shell.

1:22:55.667 --> 1:22:56.833
Capri changed that.

1:22:58.042 --> 1:22:59.125
Capri was special.

1:23:00.167 --> 1:23:01.250
And I'm…

1:23:04.792 --> 1:23:05.875
Wrap it up.

1:23:06.375 --> 1:23:07.708
…just a freak show.

1:23:08.292 --> 1:23:11.375
-[person 1] Boo! You suck!
-[person 2] What a fake.

1:23:11.458 --> 1:23:14.667
Hey, Ghost Cheerleader,
can you, like, turn the music back on?

1:23:14.750 --> 1:23:15.917
All right, posers.

1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.458
-Put your mother freakin' hands up! Yeah!
-[all cheer]

1:23:18.542 --> 1:23:22.208
[pop music playing]

1:23:26.083 --> 1:23:27.375
-[cheering]
-Yeah!

1:23:30.750 --> 1:23:32.667
[person] Cannonball!

1:23:33.250 --> 1:23:34.708
[cheering]

1:23:39.583 --> 1:23:41.083
[pop music fades, ends]

1:23:51.292 --> 1:23:52.542
[blows]

1:24:14.292 --> 1:24:15.792
[bell rings]

1:24:18.458 --> 1:24:21.458
You'd think the ghost of
a dead cheerleader crashing her own party

1:24:21.542 --> 1:24:22.833
would result in total chaos.

1:24:22.917 --> 1:24:26.250
But people like to find
an explanation for the inexplicable.

1:24:26.333 --> 1:24:29.667
No, I'm telling you, dude,
someone laced the keg with Molly.

1:24:29.750 --> 1:24:31.458
Brody told me.

1:24:31.542 --> 1:24:34.583
But there were magnets attached
to the bottom of the Ouija Board.

1:24:34.667 --> 1:24:36.583
I saw 'em when it flew over my head.

1:24:37.167 --> 1:24:40.417
And others seem to simply ignore
what they cannot understand.

1:24:40.500 --> 1:24:43.250
You missed an epic party, bro.
You hear what happened?

1:24:43.333 --> 1:24:45.583
Coop streaked the crowd
and cannonballed into the pool.

1:24:45.667 --> 1:24:46.792
[jock chuckles]

1:24:48.250 --> 1:24:49.500
[Darby] <i>In the span of a month,</i>

1:24:49.583 --> 1:24:51.042
- <i>I'd gone from…</i>
-[person] It's her!

1:24:51.125 --> 1:24:52.292
<i>…invisible,</i>

1:24:52.958 --> 1:24:54.500
<i>to queen bee,</i>

1:24:55.417 --> 1:24:57.125
<i>to social poison.</i>

1:24:58.833 --> 1:24:59.833
[shutter clicks]

1:25:02.333 --> 1:25:04.042
[person] She totally lost her shit.

1:25:05.208 --> 1:25:08.167
[kitty katxox]
<i>"Oh, my God. That is all Facetune."</i>

1:25:08.250 --> 1:25:11.083
[Taylor] <i>You pretend to see dead people.
Hashtag cancel Darby Harper.</i>

1:25:14.292 --> 1:25:16.750
[Darby] <i>The phrase,
"I wouldn't be caught dead with you"</i>

1:25:16.833 --> 1:25:19.042
<i>has never been more accurate.</i>

1:25:30.625 --> 1:25:32.625
[sighs] It's so weird to admit it now.

1:25:32.708 --> 1:25:34.417
But you're my best--

1:25:36.042 --> 1:25:37.792
My only friend.

1:25:38.458 --> 1:25:41.250
Oh, come on. You don't wanna hurt
Gary's feelings, now, do you?

1:25:41.958 --> 1:25:43.833
[scoffs] You're still here?

1:25:44.500 --> 1:25:45.500
Yeah.

1:25:46.208 --> 1:25:48.250
After you left the party, I realized…

1:25:50.125 --> 1:25:52.083
I shouldn't have forced you
to become someone else

1:25:52.167 --> 1:25:53.833
just so I could have a stupid party.

1:25:55.083 --> 1:25:56.208
Sorry.

1:25:56.292 --> 1:25:58.625
[inhales sharply]
Yeah, it was a pretty stupid party.

1:25:58.708 --> 1:25:59.958
[chuckles]

1:26:01.917 --> 1:26:04.333
But, hey, at least
I got a cool pet out of it.

1:26:05.417 --> 1:26:06.792
-[dove cooing]
-[gasps]

1:26:07.542 --> 1:26:08.833
[Darby] I named it Capricorn.

1:26:10.792 --> 1:26:12.792
God, I can't believe I acted like

1:26:12.875 --> 1:26:15.750
some kind of pathetic
attention-seeking haunter.

1:26:16.917 --> 1:26:18.042
Flying around?

1:26:18.125 --> 1:26:19.583
Scaring high schoolers? Ugh.

1:26:19.667 --> 1:26:20.792
[sighs]

1:26:20.875 --> 1:26:22.542
[Capri] And now James is a mess.

1:26:22.625 --> 1:26:26.208
He sits in front of a Ouija Board all day
and lays out cookies at night.

1:26:26.292 --> 1:26:27.708
Like I'm Santa Claus or something.

1:26:27.792 --> 1:26:28.792
Oh.

1:26:29.500 --> 1:26:30.500
[Capri] Yeah.

1:26:31.833 --> 1:26:33.458
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

1:26:33.542 --> 1:26:35.875
I've totally blown it
with the guy I actually do like.

1:26:35.958 --> 1:26:37.042
Wait, what?

1:26:37.875 --> 1:26:39.625
I never got coffee with the donut.

1:26:40.208 --> 1:26:41.250
Donut?

1:26:41.833 --> 1:26:43.833
The guy you called social suicide.

1:26:43.917 --> 1:26:45.583
Oh, God.

1:26:46.375 --> 1:26:50.458
Don't listen to me,
or Taylor or Bree or Piper.

1:26:51.125 --> 1:26:52.125
We're full of shit.

1:26:53.167 --> 1:26:55.292
You're the one who should decide
who and what you like.

1:26:55.375 --> 1:26:57.458
I'm digging this woke Barbie vibe.

1:26:57.542 --> 1:26:59.250
[chuckles] Thanks. She's new.

1:27:01.083 --> 1:27:02.542
How are you feeling about moving on?

1:27:03.333 --> 1:27:05.792
I'm… [sighs] …so ready.

1:27:06.375 --> 1:27:08.333
I've already confronted my worst fear.

1:27:08.417 --> 1:27:10.542
Being in the same outfit
for more than a week.

1:27:10.625 --> 1:27:12.208
[sighs]

1:27:12.917 --> 1:27:13.917
Anyway,

1:27:15.083 --> 1:27:18.250
I felt pretty terrible about what I said
about your mom the other night.

1:27:18.833 --> 1:27:21.917
And it made me realize
how selfish I've been all these years.

1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:23.750
So I did some asking around.

1:27:24.333 --> 1:27:25.333
And--

1:27:25.417 --> 1:27:26.417
[whooshing]

1:27:27.292 --> 1:27:28.292
[Mom] Hi, Darby.

1:27:30.750 --> 1:27:31.833
[Darby] You did stay.

1:27:33.333 --> 1:27:34.958
-Yes.
-But you never--

1:27:35.042 --> 1:27:36.583
I never wanted to leave you.

1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:39.000
[sighs]

1:27:39.583 --> 1:27:42.542
I tried to move on. But…

1:27:43.167 --> 1:27:45.417
I wanted to make sure that you'd be okay…

1:27:47.167 --> 1:27:49.000
and open up your heart to people again.

1:27:49.083 --> 1:27:50.292
[chuckles]

1:27:51.167 --> 1:27:52.333
Living people.

1:27:52.417 --> 1:27:53.417
[chuckles]

1:27:54.750 --> 1:27:55.750
And you have.

1:27:58.833 --> 1:28:00.583
You were my unfinished business, Darby.

1:28:00.667 --> 1:28:01.667
[sobs]

1:28:04.042 --> 1:28:05.333
[inhales sharply]

1:28:11.250 --> 1:28:14.417
[seagulls calling]

1:28:14.500 --> 1:28:16.333
[Capri] Do you believe in reincarnation?

1:28:17.292 --> 1:28:18.708
I was pretty fortunate in this life,

1:28:18.792 --> 1:28:21.083
so I figure in the next one,
I'll level up and be…

1:28:21.583 --> 1:28:23.792
-the next Meghan Markle or something.
-[chuckles]

1:28:27.250 --> 1:28:31.625
Promise you'll look after James
and let him know that I moved on?

1:28:32.875 --> 1:28:34.000
Yeah, I promise.

1:28:38.917 --> 1:28:41.833
Thank you for forcibly

1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:44.958
and, at times, somewhat violently

1:28:45.625 --> 1:28:47.125
pushing me out of my cocoon.

1:28:47.625 --> 1:28:51.792
You are definitely the coolest,
most special-est person I've ever met.

1:28:53.208 --> 1:28:54.875
Right back at you. Seriously.

1:28:54.958 --> 1:28:56.000
Obviously.

1:28:56.083 --> 1:28:57.667
[chuckles]

1:29:09.042 --> 1:29:10.042
[chuckles]

1:29:14.125 --> 1:29:15.250
[sighs]

1:29:16.250 --> 1:29:17.417
Bye, bitch.

1:29:30.542 --> 1:29:32.458
[Darby] <i>You know,
I don't consider high school</i>

1:29:32.542 --> 1:29:34.167
<i>to be so torturous anymore.</i>

1:29:34.250 --> 1:29:35.250
[James] Hey, Harper.

1:29:35.333 --> 1:29:38.125
<i>My fake boyfriend turned out
to be a real friend.</i>

1:29:38.208 --> 1:29:40.000
-[Darby] Harris.
-Yeah!

1:29:40.083 --> 1:29:41.083
-Whoa!
-[laughs]

1:29:42.292 --> 1:29:43.458
<i>And I stayed in cheer.</i>

1:29:44.083 --> 1:29:47.292
<i>It makes me feel closer
to a couple pretty important people.</i>

1:29:52.458 --> 1:29:53.958
[Gary] Hey, Darby.

1:29:55.667 --> 1:29:56.708
Hey, Gary.

1:29:57.167 --> 1:29:58.208
[Gary] Been a while.

1:29:59.583 --> 1:30:00.583
Uh...

1:30:01.083 --> 1:30:05.000
Listen, I-I wanna apologize
for the way I behaved.

1:30:05.083 --> 1:30:06.750
What are you talking about?
You kidding me?

1:30:06.833 --> 1:30:09.792
Come on. This-- This stuff
can get pretty confusing, right?

1:30:09.875 --> 1:30:11.125
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

1:30:11.208 --> 1:30:12.708
Hey, by the way, you know.

1:30:13.458 --> 1:30:16.583
They took Linda to a hospice.
She doesn't have long.

1:30:17.208 --> 1:30:18.208
Wow.

1:30:18.750 --> 1:30:21.167
-Gary, that's fantastic news. [chuckles]
-I know.

1:30:21.250 --> 1:30:24.833
I know, I know, now we can finally
blow this pop stand, and--

1:30:25.583 --> 1:30:26.583
and be together again.

1:30:29.208 --> 1:30:31.042
-[smacks lips]
-Oh, shoot.

1:30:31.125 --> 1:30:34.667
Um, I feel horrible about never
delivering that message for Mel.

1:30:34.750 --> 1:30:36.500
-Oh.
-Do you know where his son lives?

1:30:36.583 --> 1:30:40.208
That's okay, the, uh,
the donut took care of that.

1:30:40.292 --> 1:30:41.708
-The what?
-The donut.

1:30:41.792 --> 1:30:42.792
What do you--

1:30:42.875 --> 1:30:46.375
-[Alex] Hey, Gary. Looking good.
-[Gary] Thanks. [chuckles]

1:30:46.458 --> 1:30:49.208
-See you.
-[Alex] Take it easy, man.

1:30:49.292 --> 1:30:50.292
[Darby] What?

1:30:50.375 --> 1:30:52.250
Wait, you can see him too?

1:30:53.708 --> 1:30:55.875
-Yeah.
-Why didn't you tell me?

1:30:55.958 --> 1:30:57.167
I tried.

1:30:57.250 --> 1:30:59.167
My first day here
I saw you talking to Gary.

1:30:59.250 --> 1:31:01.375
But not something you just blurt out.

1:31:01.458 --> 1:31:05.625
Then I tried to get you someplace private
to tell you, and you didn't show up.

1:31:06.708 --> 1:31:07.708
Right.

1:31:07.792 --> 1:31:09.583
Well, but-- but how?

1:31:09.667 --> 1:31:12.667
I was in a coma last year
after a pretty bad car accident,

1:31:12.750 --> 1:31:14.000
and when I woke up,

1:31:14.083 --> 1:31:16.792
I became really good friends
with the guy in the bed next to me,

1:31:17.292 --> 1:31:19.333
only to realize he had died
two days earlier.

1:31:20.208 --> 1:31:21.167
Wow.

1:31:21.250 --> 1:31:23.875
The head shrinker said it was
a psychotic hallucination.

1:31:23.958 --> 1:31:25.292
-My parents freaked out.
-[scoffs]

1:31:25.375 --> 1:31:26.542
Took me out of school.

1:31:27.625 --> 1:31:30.125
I got so good at pretending
not to see the dead

1:31:30.208 --> 1:31:32.500
that the dead didn't even know
I could see them.

1:31:34.292 --> 1:31:36.333
You know, helping Mel cross over,

1:31:36.417 --> 1:31:41.000
it was like, finally,
this curse felt like it could be a gift.

1:31:42.792 --> 1:31:45.792
Yeah, uh, wow.

1:31:46.750 --> 1:31:48.042
Look, I just need a second.

1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:50.125
I can't believe this.

1:31:50.208 --> 1:31:52.917
I mean, I've never been able
to talk to anyone about this.

1:31:53.417 --> 1:31:56.667
Well, anyone that's living anyway,
except you, but you're not really here.

1:31:56.750 --> 1:31:58.583
You're wherever you are. [chuckles]

1:31:58.667 --> 1:32:00.500
Who are you talk-- Oh.

1:32:02.083 --> 1:32:03.083
Hi. [chuckles]

1:32:03.750 --> 1:32:05.958
Wait, you-- you can see them too?

1:32:06.458 --> 1:32:07.708
Yeah, sure. I see them,

1:32:07.792 --> 1:32:08.958
and I see them.

1:32:11.500 --> 1:32:12.500
And I see you,

1:32:13.708 --> 1:32:15.042
Darby Harper.

1:32:15.125 --> 1:32:16.333
[chuckles]

1:32:17.458 --> 1:32:21.250
Well, I'm reopening my business
and currently taking applications.

1:32:21.333 --> 1:32:24.208
Well, I-I was an assistant manager
at Jamba Juice.

1:32:24.292 --> 1:32:26.083
Wow, impressive.

1:32:26.167 --> 1:32:27.167
Reason for leaving?

1:32:27.250 --> 1:32:29.708
Got committed to a psych ward
for seeing dead people.

1:32:29.792 --> 1:32:31.542
-You're hired.
-It's a date.

1:32:31.625 --> 1:32:32.875
[chuckles]

1:32:34.583 --> 1:32:35.875
[Darby] Oh, G-- [chuckles]

1:32:35.958 --> 1:32:37.042
[laughing]

1:32:37.125 --> 1:32:38.500
That practice killed me.

1:32:38.583 --> 1:32:40.583
[Todd] Yeah, it was brutal. [laughs]

1:32:41.250 --> 1:32:42.625
I got a date with the donut.

1:32:42.708 --> 1:32:43.708
Yeah, you do.

1:32:44.208 --> 1:32:45.708
-Nice.
-That's so sweet.

1:32:45.792 --> 1:32:47.250
-[Todd] Yeah.
-I love you.

1:32:48.667 --> 1:32:49.708
[chuckles]

1:32:52.417 --> 1:32:53.417
[sighs]

1:32:58.917 --> 1:32:59.917
[Darby] Hey, what's that?

1:33:00.417 --> 1:33:03.167
That is a light kit for your videos.

1:33:03.250 --> 1:33:04.708
So you can get your glamour on.

1:33:04.792 --> 1:33:09.375
Oh. [chuckles] Thanks, Dad.
You're the best. But…

1:33:10.292 --> 1:33:11.958
Uh, you can return it though.

1:33:12.042 --> 1:33:14.208
-I'm not making those videos anymore.
-Why not?

1:33:14.292 --> 1:33:18.667
Mostly because social media makes us feel
insecure about the way we look

1:33:18.750 --> 1:33:21.875
for the sole purpose of selling us
stuff we don't need. [chuckles]

1:33:21.958 --> 1:33:25.417
Oh, now that
is the Darby Harper that I know.

1:33:25.500 --> 1:33:26.833
-[chuckles]
-[Dad] So,

1:33:26.917 --> 1:33:29.542
are you going out with your friends
for dinner tonight?

1:33:30.417 --> 1:33:35.750
Actually, I was thinking maybe we could
order pizza and share stories.

1:33:40.667 --> 1:33:41.917
[Mom chuckles]

1:33:44.292 --> 1:33:46.208
[Darby] We should do that together.

1:33:46.292 --> 1:33:49.000
[Dad] Mm-hmm. I don't know if I could.

1:33:49.083 --> 1:33:50.542
[Darby] You could.

1:33:52.958 --> 1:33:54.458
Oh, that was before we moved.

1:33:55.083 --> 1:33:56.667
-Yeah.
-That was the best.

1:34:00.708 --> 1:34:02.792
The slide. We should have kept that.

1:34:03.375 --> 1:34:04.708
[speaks indistinctly]

1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:42.917
[sighs] Ah, that was so fun.

1:34:46.833 --> 1:34:47.917
Wait, me too?

1:34:58.208 --> 1:34:59.625
Hey. How are you?

1:34:59.708 --> 1:35:01.208
I'm fine. How are you?

1:35:11.583 --> 1:35:12.708
Get a room.

1:35:14.875 --> 1:35:15.958
[chuckles]
