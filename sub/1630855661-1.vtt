How can you hate it?

01:26.173 --> 01:28.088
It's not hateable,
it's a classic.

So, how is work?

02:06.038 --> 02:08.519
You're still working
for that travel magazine?

02:08.693 --> 02:10.391
It went bust last year.

02:10.565 --> 02:13.437
Oh...

02:13.611 --> 02:15.787
No, it's okay.
Something will come up.

02:17.876 --> 02:22.794
How about you? How is life
in the decompression chamber?

02:22.968 --> 02:26.842
Anything dirty you need to tell
me about those oily oil rig men?

02:27.016 --> 02:30.628
Hmm?

02:30.802 --> 02:32.761
No.

02:36.068 --> 02:38.854
You're still living
with that surf shop guy?

02:39.028 --> 02:40.508
What?

02:40.682 --> 02:42.771
Oh! No. That's...

02:42.945 --> 02:44.860
No, that's in the past.

02:46.905 --> 02:48.472
So, where do you live?

02:48.646 --> 02:51.519
Right now with mom actually.

02:51.693 --> 02:53.042
All right.

02:56.437 --> 03:00.267
She's doing good.

03:00.441 --> 03:01.485
Mm.

03:01.659 --> 03:03.966
Mom? She is doing good.

03:04.140 --> 03:05.750
I thought you might
want to know.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.839
Okay.

03:29.818 --> 03:32.777
- Ah.
- Nice.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.843
It's pretty steep.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.888
It's all right.

04:55.077 --> 04:57.427
Is that really necessary?
It's not that kind of cave.

04:57.601 --> 05:00.256
It's an overhead environment,
so we bring a reel.

05:00.430 --> 05:01.953
Okay.

05:04.478 --> 05:07.872
Oh, my God, fancy!

05:08.046 --> 05:11.136
Divepath QR4 with intercom.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.139
"Divepath QR4
with intercom"!

05:14.314 --> 05:16.272
You're such a nerd.

05:16.446 --> 05:19.536
Do you dream
of your equipment at night?

05:19.710 --> 05:24.672
"Oh my God, my new BCD,
it feels so good when it's wet,

05:24.846 --> 05:28.719
oh, I love it."

05:56.399 --> 06:00.055
Yeah, I still get
a bit nervous every time.

06:00.229 --> 06:01.839
Lucky you.

06:02.013 --> 06:05.408
Lucky me?
What do you mean?

06:05.582 --> 06:07.236
Nervous is good.

06:07.410 --> 06:10.674
Excitement is a good thing.

06:10.848 --> 06:14.286
Whatever you say.
Okay, let's do this.

06:32.653 --> 06:35.786
<i>Let's descend to 50 feet.</i>

06:35.960 --> 06:39.224
<i>- You lead, I follow.
- Okay!</i>

07:20.831 --> 07:22.833
<i>I missed this feeling.</i>

08:38.039 --> 08:41.390
<i>Right, back into the womb.</i>

08:43.566 --> 08:46.134
<i>I already regret that
I brought the comm system.</i>

08:48.266 --> 08:49.964
<i>Okay.</i>

09:08.939 --> 09:11.376
<i>- Nice.
-"Nice"?</i>

09:11.551 --> 09:14.379
<i>It's fucking amazing!</i>

09:19.776 --> 09:21.865
<i>Let's go to 30 feet.</i>

09:22.039 --> 09:25.129
<i>There's got to be an entrance
to this cute little cave</i>

09:25.303 --> 09:27.784
<i>somewhere around here.</i>

09:27.958 --> 09:30.352
<i>Okay, I'm right behind you.</i>

09:51.329 --> 09:53.897
<i>We're at 20 feet.</i>

09:54.071 --> 09:57.379
<i>Perfect dive bell conditions.</i>

09:57.553 --> 10:02.993
<i>There's already air in it but
it's probably a bit toxic.</i>

10:03.167 --> 10:06.257
<i>Let's put some fresh air in it.</i>

10:16.354 --> 10:18.443
<i>That's enough. It's enough!</i>

10:39.682 --> 10:41.292
The air is good, right?

10:45.557 --> 10:47.734
We're at 20 feet.

10:47.908 --> 10:49.953
Isn't this great?

11:01.138 --> 11:03.053
You know what's strange?

11:05.186 --> 11:07.536
I don't even know
if you're enjoying this.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.712
I mean...

11:09.886 --> 11:12.149
I can't read you anymore.

11:17.285 --> 11:20.244
Are you enjoying this, like...

11:20.418 --> 11:25.119
I talk you into these trips
every year, but...

11:25.293 --> 11:26.729
Do you actually want to go?

11:26.903 --> 11:28.731
Of course I do.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.650
Okay.

11:38.393 --> 11:43.093
I'm sorry that I'm not
expressing that properly.

11:43.267 --> 11:44.529
No, I didn't--

11:44.704 --> 11:46.053
I didn't mean it like
a criticism.

11:46.227 --> 11:47.402
Just...

11:56.628 --> 11:58.326
Are you okay?

12:06.987 --> 12:09.685
You left a hole when you left.

12:35.145 --> 12:37.321
<i>May, wait.</i>

12:40.977 --> 12:43.066
May.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.336
<i>Come on, wait!</i>

13:14.706 --> 13:16.230
<i>May?</i>

13:22.497 --> 13:24.238
<i>Why aren't you answering me?</i>

13:33.638 --> 13:34.509
<i>What's wrong?</i>

13:39.644 --> 13:44.127
<i>Just talk to me, please!</i>

13:44.301 --> 13:47.087
<i>Do you hear this?</i>

13:49.480 --> 13:50.568
<i>May?</i>

13:50.742 --> 13:52.005
<i>Aah!</i>

13:52.179 --> 13:54.834
<i>Move to the wall!</i>

13:58.315 --> 14:03.886
<i>Fuck! May!</i>

14:04.060 --> 14:08.369
<i>May! Look out! May!</i>

14:16.377 --> 14:19.162
<i>Oh, God!</i>

14:28.215 --> 14:31.392
<i>May?</i>

14:31.566 --> 14:34.308
<i>May, can you hear me?</i>

14:34.482 --> 14:37.746
<i>Please! [Whimpers]</i>

14:37.920 --> 14:39.791
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

14:42.969 --> 14:44.666
<i>Fuck.</i>

14:57.070 --> 14:59.333
<i>May?</i>

15:15.653 --> 15:17.655
<i>Okay.</i>

15:17.829 --> 15:19.701
<i>I'm coming...</i>

15:19.875 --> 15:22.008
<i>I'm going to come down.</i>

15:39.416 --> 15:43.551
<i>Okay... Okay...</i>

15:43.725 --> 15:45.553
<i>Okay...</i>

15:55.476 --> 15:57.695
<i>Okay.</i>

16:00.176 --> 16:02.657
<i>I'm here at the bottom.</i>

16:02.831 --> 16:06.530
<i>I'll find you, I promise.</i>

16:08.489 --> 16:11.579
<i>Okay...</i>

16:15.713 --> 16:17.541
<i>Okay.</i>

16:21.719 --> 16:24.418
<i>You can do this,
you can do this.</i>

16:32.208 --> 16:36.865
<i>May, if can you hear me,
shine your light.</i>

16:56.841 --> 16:58.843
<i>I can't see anything.</i>

17:03.935 --> 17:05.589
<i>May!</i>

17:16.035 --> 17:18.428
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

17:18.602 --> 17:20.604
<i>...hear me?!</i>

17:20.778 --> 17:23.694
<i>Drew?
- May!</i>

17:23.868 --> 17:25.783
<i>- May! Are you okay?
- I'm not--</i>

17:25.957 --> 17:29.918
<i>What? I can't...
I can't hear you,</i>

17:30.092 --> 17:32.747
<i>it's like breaking up.
What?</i>

17:34.662 --> 17:36.707
<i>Can you go to the surface?</i>

17:36.881 --> 17:38.361
<i>I'm stuck.</i>

17:38.535 --> 17:40.015
<i>- What?
- I'm stuck.</i>

17:40.189 --> 17:42.539
<i>You're stuck! Are you hurt?</i>

17:42.713 --> 17:45.064
<i>- I don't know.
- Okay.</i>

17:45.238 --> 17:48.850
<i>I'm on 100 feet.</i>

17:49.024 --> 17:52.332
<i>I'm gonna turn off my light.</i>

17:52.506 --> 17:54.508
<i>Can you turn on your light?</i>

17:57.380 --> 17:58.251
<i>Drew.</i>

18:07.216 --> 18:10.915
<i>God, I can't see anything!
I can't see anything!</i>

18:16.791 --> 18:19.707
<i>Where's the reel?
I-I just had it!</i>

18:19.881 --> 18:22.231
<i>I dropped it!
I can't find it!</i>

18:22.405 --> 18:26.105
<i>- Stay calm.
- Fuck!</i>

18:26.279 --> 18:29.108
<i>Where is it?</i>

18:29.282 --> 18:30.848
<i>I can't find it.</i>

18:31.022 --> 18:32.676
<i>- Calm down.
- It's okay, it's okay,</i>

18:32.850 --> 18:34.504
<i>it's okay, I-I got it,
I got it.</i>

18:38.073 --> 18:39.857
<i>What's your air?</i>

18:40.031 --> 18:41.990
<i>I'm 100 bar.</i>

18:42.164 --> 18:44.297
<i>Are you still at the wall?</i>

18:44.471 --> 18:49.345
<i>- Yeah, yeah, it's behind me.
- Okay, then-- [distorted]</i>

18:49.519 --> 18:51.869
<i>I can hardly hear you, it's...</i>

18:52.043 --> 18:53.958
<i>Just keep talking, okay?</i>

18:54.133 --> 18:57.179
<i>Keep the wall on your left
and stay parallel to it.</i>

18:57.353 --> 18:59.050
<i>Okay, I've got it.</i>

19:16.981 --> 19:19.506
<i>Drew, keep shining
your light around.</i>

19:25.076 --> 19:27.905
<i>I can see something!</i>

19:28.079 --> 19:30.212
<i>I see you!</i>

19:30.386 --> 19:32.127
<i>Yes, I see your light.</i>

19:33.955 --> 19:37.045
<i>Oh, thank God!
Oh, my God, what the fuck...</i>

19:37.219 --> 19:40.179
<i>Oh my God, are you hurt?
- I'm okay.</i>

19:40.353 --> 19:42.268
<i>Oh, my God, we need to get
this thing off of you.</i>

19:42.442 --> 19:45.227
<i>- Keep it together.
- May!</i>

19:45.401 --> 19:47.751
<i>Calm down.
Wait, look at me.</i>

19:47.925 --> 19:49.710
<i>What about your legs?
Oh, my God!</i>

19:49.884 --> 19:54.018
<i>We've got to lift the rock!
Okay?</i>

19:54.193 --> 19:57.152
<i>Push with your back
at the same time.</i>

20:00.503 --> 20:01.765
<i>Again!</i>

20:10.905 --> 20:12.776
<i>It's not moving.</i>

20:15.431 --> 20:17.694
<i>I'm gonna pull you out.
I'll try to pull you, okay?</i>

20:17.868 --> 20:21.437
<i>Ready? One, two, three.</i>

20:25.833 --> 20:27.530
<i>I can't.</i>

20:30.403 --> 20:32.056
<i>This is not working!</i>

20:32.231 --> 20:33.623
<i>We need to get this thing
off you.</i>

20:33.797 --> 20:35.146
<i>This isn't working.</i>

20:35.321 --> 20:36.278
<i>We need to get you
out of here!</i>

20:36.452 --> 20:38.149
<i>We will.</i>

20:38.324 --> 20:40.369
<i>But for now you have
to leave me here.</i>

20:40.543 --> 20:42.850
<i>What the hell, what do you
mean leave you here?</i>

20:43.024 --> 20:45.331
<i>You have to go to the surface
and call for help.</i>

20:45.505 --> 20:47.942
<i>- What?
- Drew!</i>

20:48.116 --> 20:51.032
<i>I need you to get
your shit together, okay?!</i>

20:51.206 --> 20:53.077
<i>I know you can do it.</i>

20:53.252 --> 20:55.819
<i>Are you with me?</i>

20:55.993 --> 20:59.519
<i>- Yeah.
- Okay, what's your air?</i>

21:01.912 --> 21:03.697
<i>- 85 bar.
- Okay, I'm at 100.</i>

21:03.871 --> 21:06.874
<i>At this depth, I can make that
last 25 minutes or so.</i>

21:07.048 --> 21:09.180
<i>No one can make it here
in 25 minutes, May.</i>

21:09.355 --> 21:12.619
<i>I know, I know-- listen, this
is what you're gonna do.</i>

21:12.793 --> 21:14.708
<i>A direct ascent to the surface.</i>

21:14.882 --> 21:16.579
<i>Your dive computer will go
crazy, telling you</i>

21:16.753 --> 21:18.712
<i>to make a decompression stop,
but just ignore it.</i>

21:18.886 --> 21:21.192
<i>You're within save limits.
Do you understand?</i>

21:21.367 --> 21:23.891
<i>- Yeah, yeah. Okay.
- Our comms will not work</i>

21:24.065 --> 21:26.328
<i>when you're out of the water
so we're not going to be able</i>

21:26.502 --> 21:28.156
<i>to talk, so you have to
remember what I'm</i>

21:28.330 --> 21:30.289
<i>telling you now, okay?</i>

21:30.463 --> 21:34.684
<i>- Okay.
- When you're up, call for help.</i>

21:34.858 --> 21:36.860
<i>Then you need to bring
the extra air.</i>

21:37.034 --> 21:38.949
<i>There are two tanks
at the base.</i>

21:39.123 --> 21:41.561
<i>There are another two tanks
on the back seat of the car.</i>

21:41.735 --> 21:43.214
<i>If there is enough time,
you need to bring them</i>

21:43.389 --> 21:45.652
<i>over to the base.
And there is a car jack.</i>

21:45.826 --> 21:47.697
<i>- Car jack! Yes!
- In the trunk.</i>

21:47.871 --> 21:50.134
<i>- Okay, okay.
- Bring that too,</i>
so we can lift the rock.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.267
<i>When you get out of the water,
you have to set</i>

21:52.441 --> 21:54.008
<i>an alarm for 20 minutes.</i>

21:54.182 --> 21:56.053
<i>You have to be back
with the air by then.</i>

21:56.227 --> 21:57.881
<i>- 20 minutes, okay.
- Okay?</i>

21:58.055 --> 21:59.361
<i>I can do it, I can do it!</i>

21:59.535 --> 22:01.363
<i>Drew! Wait, wait.</i>

22:03.670 --> 22:05.759
<i>It's all good.</i>

22:05.933 --> 22:09.719
<i>We have plenty of options.
Just stay calm.</i>

22:09.893 --> 22:12.069
<i>Calm.
Do one thing after the other.</i>

22:12.243 --> 22:14.463
<i>The calmer you are,
the less air you use,</i>

22:14.637 --> 22:17.597
<i>remember that.
- Yes.</i>

22:17.771 --> 22:20.861
<i>The calmer you are,
the less air you use.</i>

22:21.035 --> 22:22.645
<i>Yes! Yes. Yes.</i>

22:31.872 --> 22:34.309
<i>The calmer you are,
the less air you use.</i>

22:39.009 --> 22:41.838
<i>Calm.</i>

22:42.012 --> 22:46.016
<i>The calmer you are,
the less air you use.</i>

22:46.190 --> 22:48.018
<i>The calmer you are...</i>

22:49.890 --> 22:52.414
<i>Don't think.</i>

23:00.509 --> 23:02.119
<i>Don't think.</i>

24:21.024 --> 24:22.591
No, no, no!

24:22.765 --> 24:25.594
Shit.

25:05.852 --> 25:07.723
<i>Don't think.</i>

25:17.080 --> 25:21.084
Lucky me?

25:21.258 --> 25:23.391
What do you mean?

25:23.565 --> 25:25.262
<i>So, where do you live?</i>

25:25.436 --> 25:28.048
<i>Right now with mom, actually.</i>

25:43.803 --> 25:45.282
Are you okay?

25:52.159 --> 25:54.030
<i>Don't think.</i>

26:15.225 --> 26:17.663
Fuck! Shit.

26:20.317 --> 26:22.276
Twenty... minus four.

27:08.757 --> 27:11.542
Trunk release.

27:15.242 --> 27:17.331
Fuck!

27:22.641 --> 27:24.164
Fuck!

27:30.431 --> 27:31.867
What the fuck?!

27:32.041 --> 27:34.000
Fuck!

27:57.545 --> 27:59.982
No... Fuck!

28:00.156 --> 28:02.245
Shit!

28:14.562 --> 28:17.870
What are you...?

29:33.423 --> 29:35.469
Hey! Hey!

29:35.643 --> 29:37.732
Hey!

29:37.906 --> 29:40.691
Help! Help!

29:43.912 --> 29:45.218
Shit.

29:49.309 --> 29:50.745
Help!

29:58.709 --> 29:59.754
Help!

30:19.295 --> 30:21.602
Help!
Help!

30:21.776 --> 30:24.648
Hey!

30:49.151 --> 30:50.109
Help!

30:50.283 --> 30:52.415
Hey! Over here!

30:57.116 --> 30:58.160
Fuck!

31:48.167 --> 31:50.212
Hey!

31:50.386 --> 31:52.214
Please help!

31:52.388 --> 31:54.608
Hey! Over here!

31:54.782 --> 31:57.002
No! Please! No!

33:21.651 --> 33:23.827
<i>Breathe.
Just breathe.</i>

33:24.002 --> 33:28.702
<i>It's okay.
It's okay. Breathe.</i>

33:36.666 --> 33:38.625
<i>Are you okay?</i>

33:41.715 --> 33:45.501
<i>Listen, I dropped the tank.</i>

33:45.675 --> 33:49.288
<i>I know.
I gotta go find it.</i>

33:49.462 --> 33:51.812
<i>It can't be far.
I saw where I dropped it.</i>

33:51.986 --> 33:54.902
<i>I'm going to leave
my air with you.</i>

33:55.076 --> 33:57.513
<i>Yes. I'll freedive.
Don't worry.</i>

33:57.687 --> 34:00.516
<i>It can't be far.
I gotta go get it.</i>

34:02.779 --> 34:05.347
<i>I gotta get my half-mask.</i>

34:05.521 --> 34:08.307
<i>Be ready with your octopus.</i>

34:08.481 --> 34:10.961
<i>Okay.</i>

34:17.707 --> 34:19.231
<i>Let me breathe.</i>

34:19.405 --> 34:21.059
<i>My switch.</i>

38:21.951 --> 38:25.694
<i>Okay. Let's hook you up
to the new tank.</i>

38:33.702 --> 38:35.878
<i>Lean forward.</i>

38:47.803 --> 38:50.066
<i>Okay.</i>

38:50.240 --> 38:52.242
<i>Okay.
Okay, yeah, you do it, yeah.</i>

38:52.417 --> 38:54.680
<i>You do it. Good.</i>

39:07.301 --> 39:09.434
<i>Ah, thank God!</i>

39:11.610 --> 39:14.134
<i>Now switch to
your full face mask.</i>

39:37.810 --> 39:39.333
<i>Why didn't you bring the jack?</i>

39:39.507 --> 39:41.379
<i>The rock fall buried
everything--</i>

39:41.553 --> 39:43.511
<i>the tanks, the car keys, everything.</i>

39:43.685 --> 39:46.906
<i>I had to break the--
- So you didn't call for help?</i>

39:47.080 --> 39:50.823
<i>Our phones are buried!
- Oh, God help us.</i>

39:50.997 --> 39:53.521
<i>There's a house on the map
and there's a boat</i>

39:53.695 --> 39:55.305
<i>and it saw me
and I have to go back</i>

39:55.480 --> 39:57.351
<i>and make sure that they know
that we need help.</i>

39:57.525 --> 39:59.484
<i>- What about the jack?
- I can't get into the trunk</i>

39:59.658 --> 40:02.312
<i>without the car keys.
- Okay, how far is the house?</i>

40:02.487 --> 40:04.532
<i>- Maybe a mile.
- That's too far.</i>

40:04.706 --> 40:06.360
<i>Forget the house,
and if there's no boat,</i>

40:06.534 --> 40:07.927
<i>you have to get the jack, Drew.</i>

40:08.101 --> 40:09.711
<i>I tried, I can't get in there.</i>

40:09.885 --> 40:11.191
<i>Well try harder,
it's not invincible.</i>

40:11.365 --> 40:13.846
<i>There's got to be a way.
- Okay, okay.</i>

40:14.020 --> 40:15.804
<i>Drew, you have to make a
decompression stop this time.</i>

40:15.978 --> 40:17.458
<i>Did you change tanks or are
you still on the old one?</i>

40:17.632 --> 40:19.939
<i>The old one.</i>

40:20.113 --> 40:22.855
<i>50 bar.
- Listen, your inflator hose</i>

40:23.029 --> 40:24.683
<i>is damaged.
- What?</i>

40:24.857 --> 40:26.989
<i>Your inflator hose is damaged.</i>

40:27.163 --> 40:29.862
<i>It's okay for now,
but if the hole expands,</i>

40:30.036 --> 40:31.516
<i>you'll lose too much air.</i>

40:31.690 --> 40:33.605
<i>You have to try to fix it
at the surface.</i>

40:33.779 --> 40:35.128
<i>- Okay.
- You have to go now.</i>

40:35.302 --> 40:36.608
<i>Get the jack.
- Yeah.</i>

40:36.782 --> 40:38.697
<i>Go, go!</i>

40:47.662 --> 40:50.665
<i>Drew?
- Yeah?</i>

40:50.839 --> 40:53.538
<i>Even if help is coming,
you're going to have to make</i>

40:53.712 --> 40:55.278
<i>at least one more dive
to bring me</i>

40:55.453 --> 40:56.845
<i>the second spare tank.</i>

40:57.019 --> 40:58.630
<i>You have to make
a decompression stop</i>

40:58.804 --> 40:59.979
<i>this time, okay?</i>

41:00.153 --> 41:01.676
<i>The boat's gonna leave,
though!</i>

41:01.850 --> 41:03.461
<i>Your nitrogen level
is already too high,</i>

41:03.635 --> 41:04.940
you have to decompress.
<i>- But we have to get help!</i>

41:05.114 --> 41:07.029
<i>Drew!
You have to decompress!</i>

41:07.203 --> 41:09.031
<i>I'm at 20 feet, how long?</i>

41:09.205 --> 41:10.859
<i>May, how long?</i>

41:11.033 --> 41:12.818
<i>- At least five minutes.
- What?</i>

41:12.992 --> 41:15.124
<i>The boat is going to leave!
- You have to decompress!</i>

41:15.298 --> 41:16.778
<i>I've gotta get help!
I can't wait!</i>

41:16.952 --> 41:18.388
<i>You have to decompress!</i>

41:18.563 --> 41:19.955
<i>No, the boat is more important.</i>

41:20.129 --> 41:21.870
<i>You have to decompress!</i>

41:32.751 --> 41:35.144
<i>Fuck!</i>

43:15.593 --> 43:16.985
Please be a house!

43:50.366 --> 43:52.455
<i>The calmer you are...</i>

43:52.630 --> 43:55.850
<i>The calmer you are,
the less air you use.</i>

43:56.024 --> 43:59.332
<i>Don't think.
Five seconds in.</i>

44:02.248 --> 44:03.902
<i>Five seconds out.</i>

44:07.383 --> 44:09.037
<i>Five seconds in.</i>

44:11.518 --> 44:16.001
- Are you okay?
<i>- Five seconds out.</i>

44:16.175 --> 44:19.221
I don't even know
if you're enjoying this.

44:19.395 --> 44:25.837
I talk you into these trips
every year, but...

44:26.011 --> 44:27.534
do you actually want to go?

44:35.150 --> 44:38.153
I really do.

44:38.327 --> 44:41.635
I want to go on-- I want to go
on these trips with you.

44:45.030 --> 44:47.467
It just... doesn't show.

45:01.307 --> 45:03.091
<i>Don't think.</i>

46:28.524 --> 46:31.658
Help! Hello?

46:31.832 --> 46:33.834
Help!

46:36.924 --> 46:40.014
Hello!

46:41.973 --> 46:43.322
Fuck!

46:50.111 --> 46:51.417
Hey!

47:14.701 --> 47:16.442
Help!

47:16.616 --> 47:18.009
Hello?!

49:55.775 --> 50:00.345
<i>You know...</i>

50:00.519 --> 50:03.913
<i>You left a hole
when you left.</i>

50:04.088 --> 50:07.961
I don't even know
if you're enjoying this, like...

50:08.135 --> 50:09.702
I can't reach you anymore.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.970
Are you enjoying this, like...

50:17.144 --> 50:19.016
No.

50:19.190 --> 50:21.627
I'm not enjoying this.

50:21.801 --> 50:24.760
I'm bored.
And your...

50:24.934 --> 50:28.199
enthusiasm, your greenness
and innocence fucking annoy me,

50:28.373 --> 50:29.852
I can't stand it.

50:30.027 --> 50:31.767
You remind me of something
I've lost,

50:31.941 --> 50:33.943
and I hate myself for that,

50:34.118 --> 50:35.771
so, no, I'm not okay,
not at all.

50:35.945 --> 50:37.425
Fuck you for telling me
I left a hole.

50:37.599 --> 50:39.949
I had-- I had to go!
But you can't see that,

50:40.124 --> 50:41.821
'cause you're a little princess,
you live in a fairytale

50:41.995 --> 50:44.389
and you always will.
Grow the fuck up!

53:15.975 --> 53:17.281
Car jack, car jack...

53:29.641 --> 53:31.773
"Fix-a-Flat."

53:59.148 --> 54:01.542
No!

54:01.716 --> 54:05.416
I'm sorry!

54:07.592 --> 54:09.507
May!

54:15.643 --> 54:17.515
I'm sorry.

55:09.828 --> 55:11.220
You know what?

55:11.395 --> 55:13.440
Today is not the day for a dive.

55:21.100 --> 55:23.929
Are you okay?

55:24.103 --> 55:26.540
No. No.

55:26.714 --> 55:28.673
I'm not okay, not at all.

55:31.937 --> 55:34.069
You remind me of something
I've lost.

55:35.897 --> 55:37.769
And I fucking hate myself
for that.

55:44.993 --> 55:47.039
I wish I still had that feeling.

58:41.387 --> 58:44.521
<i>May? I'm here. I'm coming.</i>

58:44.695 --> 58:46.914
<i>I'm coming.</i>

58:47.088 --> 58:48.786
<i>May, are you okay?</i>

58:48.960 --> 58:50.309
<i>- I saw something.
- What?</i>

58:50.483 --> 58:51.963
<i>Something out there
in the blue.</i>

58:52.137 --> 58:54.139
<i>- What did you see?
- There are so many ways</i>

58:54.313 --> 58:55.749
<i>how this could end.</i>

58:55.923 --> 58:58.186
<i>But it's all happening
for a reason.</i>

58:58.360 --> 59:01.363
<i>I belong here.
- What? No, it's not real.</i>

59:01.538 --> 59:03.627
<i>You have nitrogen narcosis,
okay?</i>

59:03.801 --> 59:06.238
<i>- I saw something.
- Please, snap out of it, okay?</i>

59:06.412 --> 59:09.415
<i>It's not real.
- Nitrogen narcosis, yeah, okay.</i>

59:09.589 --> 59:12.113
<i>I'm going to lift the rock
with this pole.</i>

59:12.287 --> 59:16.640
<i>Ready? May?
May, please, snap out of it.</i>

59:16.814 --> 59:19.686
<i>I need your help.
- Yes, the rock,</i>

59:19.860 --> 59:21.732
<i>we're going to lift it. Okay.
- Yes?</i>

59:21.906 --> 59:24.082
<i>We're going to lift it, okay.</i>

59:24.256 --> 59:25.953
<i>- Ready?
- Yeah.</i>

59:26.127 --> 59:27.607
<i>One, two three!</i>

59:36.485 --> 59:39.576
<i>No! Fuck.</i>

59:43.492 --> 59:45.756
<i>I just switch tanks now
so I don't run out of air.</i>

59:45.930 --> 59:49.063
<i>I'll stay in my full face mask
and I hold my breath.</i>

01:00:08.126 --> 01:00:10.041
<i>Okay.</i>

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.786
<i>Stay calm.</i>

01:00:22.357 --> 01:00:26.971
<i>What's going on?
Let me try.</i>

01:00:27.145 --> 01:00:29.277
<i>It won't work,
it's free-spinning.</i>

01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:31.410
<i>Drew, stop it, it won't work.</i>

01:00:31.584 --> 01:00:33.847
<i>Switch back to your old tank.</i>

01:00:34.021 --> 01:00:35.283
<i>Switch back now!</i>

01:00:53.345 --> 01:00:54.825
<i>I dropped it!</i>

01:00:54.999 --> 01:00:56.870
<i>I checked the threading,
but I didn't check</i>

01:00:57.044 --> 01:00:59.133
<i>if the valve would open.</i>

01:00:59.307 --> 01:01:02.615
<i>Let's try this again.
We can do it!</i>

01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:06.271
<i>Push with your back
at the same time. Okay?</i>

01:01:06.445 --> 01:01:08.316
<i>Okay, I'll try.</i>

01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:10.275
<i>One, two, three!</i>

01:01:17.804 --> 01:01:20.067
<i>Yes! It's moving!</i>

01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:22.026
<i>I can feel it moving!</i>

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.418
<i>Yes!</i>

01:01:25.116 --> 01:01:27.814
<i>What?</i>

01:01:27.988 --> 01:01:29.555
<i>No!</i>

01:01:50.881 --> 01:01:53.753
<i>May?
- What?</i>

01:01:53.927 --> 01:01:55.973
<i>What do I do?</i>

01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:02.240
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:02:02.414 --> 01:02:03.763
<i>What do you mean,
you don't know?</i>

01:02:03.937 --> 01:02:05.547
<i>Come on! Tell me...
- I don't know...</i>

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:09.421
<i>- Tell me what to do.
- I can't think.</i>

01:02:09.595 --> 01:02:11.249
<i>- What?
- I can't...</i>

01:02:11.423 --> 01:02:12.903
<i>You need to help me,
please help me.</i>

01:02:13.077 --> 01:02:15.209
<i>You have to--
- I can't, I can't focus.</i>

01:02:15.383 --> 01:02:17.516
<i>What would dad have done?</i>

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:21.302
<i>Come on,
what would dad have done?!</i>

01:02:21.476 --> 01:02:23.435
<i>I don't know!</i>

01:02:27.961 --> 01:02:29.833
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:02:32.574 --> 01:02:34.054
<i>Please go up.</i>

01:02:42.584 --> 01:02:44.325
<i>Go up, Drew.</i>

01:02:50.679 --> 01:02:54.422
<i>I'm going to put my BCD-jacket
under the rock and inflate it.</i>

01:02:54.596 --> 01:02:58.862
<i>This is it, okay? It's going
to work like an air cushion.</i>

01:02:59.036 --> 01:03:00.864
<i>This is going to work, okay?</i>

01:03:01.038 --> 01:03:02.561
<i>Okay, ready?</i>

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.356
<i>- Yeah.
- Okay.</i>

01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:17.315
<i>Where is the inflator?</i>

01:03:20.405 --> 01:03:24.061
<i>It works. It's working!</i>

01:03:25.976 --> 01:03:30.197
<i>No, no, no! Fuck, the safety
valve keeps opening.</i>

01:03:30.371 --> 01:03:32.983
<i>Fuck! No, no!
Come on!</i>

01:03:35.028 --> 01:03:37.291
<i>Fuck!</i>

01:03:41.469 --> 01:03:43.428
<i>I'm almost out of air.</i>

01:03:55.266 --> 01:03:59.009
I love you.

01:03:59.183 --> 01:04:01.141
<i> I love you.</i>

01:04:03.448 --> 01:04:07.060
<i>It's okay, Drew.</i>

01:04:07.234 --> 01:04:09.715
<i>It's okay.</i>

01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:12.370
<i>Drew, you did
everything you could.</i>

01:04:14.763 --> 01:04:16.635
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

01:04:18.985 --> 01:04:20.769
<i>Don't feel guilty.</i>

01:04:20.944 --> 01:04:24.948
<i>Drew, you're going to have
a good life, I know.</i>

01:04:25.122 --> 01:04:27.689
<i>And now please go up, Drew.</i>

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:30.431
<i>Will you please go up?</i>

01:04:30.605 --> 01:04:31.998
<i>Please go up and make
a decompression stop.</i>

01:04:32.172 --> 01:04:34.044
<i>Please, would you do it for me?</i>

01:04:34.218 --> 01:04:37.177
<i>You have to go up now.</i>

01:04:37.351 --> 01:04:38.875
<i>Please.</i>

01:04:45.403 --> 01:04:49.276
<i>I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry.</i>

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:52.366
<i>It's okay, Drew, it's okay.</i>

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:54.760
<i>Let it go.</i>

01:04:58.982 --> 01:05:00.853
<i>Just let it go.</i>

01:05:09.166 --> 01:05:11.429
<i>No.</i>

01:05:11.603 --> 01:05:13.561
I'm not giving up.

01:05:13.735 --> 01:05:14.911
<i>Someone could have
seen my message.</i>

01:05:15.085 --> 01:05:16.434
<i>There could be a boat.</i>

01:05:16.608 --> 01:05:17.696
<i>I'm not going to
let you fucking die!</i>

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:19.698
<i>There will be no boat.</i>

01:05:19.872 --> 01:05:21.352
<i>You have to take my air and
make a decompression stop.</i>

01:05:21.526 --> 01:05:23.832
<i>If I surface now
there's still a chance!</i>

01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:26.835
<i>No. You won't survive it!</i>

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:28.968

So sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:10:39.409 --> 01:10:40.888
I belong here.

01:12:40.965 --> 01:12:44.098

01:12:46.623 --> 01:12:48.799
<i>Why did you come back?</i>

01:13:48.554 --> 01:13:51.514
<i>Yes! It's working! Feel it?</i>

01:13:51.688 --> 01:13:53.341
<i>I feel it moving! Push!</i>

01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:11.664
<i>Drew.</i>

01:14:11.838 --> 01:14:14.624

01:14:14.798 --> 01:14:18.236
<i>Oh, my God... Drew...</i>

01:14:25.025 --> 01:14:29.334
<i>I got you. I got you.
Oh, my God.</i>

01:14:55.447 --> 01:14:57.231
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

01:15:37.576 --> 01:15:39.099
You have to decompress.

01:15:39.273 --> 01:15:41.275
If you go to the surface now,
you'll die.

01:15:41.449 --> 01:15:43.277
You have to stay in here
for as long as possible.

01:15:43.451 --> 01:15:46.106
It's going to work like
a decompression chamber.

01:15:48.587 --> 01:15:51.938
That's all we have.

01:15:52.112 --> 01:15:55.159
Okay. I have to go.

01:15:55.333 --> 01:15:57.030
I have to go to the surface.
- What?

01:15:57.204 --> 01:15:58.466
- I can't use up your air.
- No.

01:15:58.641 --> 01:16:02.558
Yeah.
It's okay, I'm coming back.

01:16:05.343 --> 01:16:07.650
Do not give up.

01:16:07.824 --> 01:16:10.043
Fucking don't give up now,
okay?!

01:16:10.217 --> 01:16:12.655
Oh, shit!

01:16:12.829 --> 01:16:14.395
It's not gonna...

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.876
It's not gonna be enough.
It's not enough.

01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:18.661
The air in here
is not going to be enough.

01:16:18.835 --> 01:16:22.055
You need much more time in here.
Okay, think, think, think.

01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:24.014
There's a way!
I saw it down there, I saw it.

01:16:24.188 --> 01:16:26.103
I saw it.

01:16:26.277 --> 01:16:29.715
We just need more air.

01:16:29.889 --> 01:16:32.022
The t-tank.

01:16:32.196 --> 01:16:33.763
The tank at the bottom,
it's a full tank.

01:16:33.937 --> 01:16:35.547
- The valve won't open.
- I'm gonna bring it up here

01:16:35.721 --> 01:16:36.940
and I'm gonna break it
fucking open!

01:16:37.114 --> 01:16:38.681
- Free-diving?
- Yeah, it's possible.

01:16:38.855 --> 01:16:40.421
- No.
- It's possible.

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:43.424
No, it's not,
we'll have to relay...

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:45.339
Shut up, I'm doing it.

01:16:48.473 --> 01:16:50.954
I have to breathe up, it's gonna
use up your air in here.

01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:52.912
Do it.

01:16:53.086 --> 01:16:54.566
Okay.

01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:56.176
I'm coming back.

01:17:41.091 --> 01:17:44.094
- No...

01:17:44.268 --> 01:17:46.662
Okay...

01:20:26.734 --> 01:20:30.477
Drew! Drew!
Drew!

01:20:30.651 --> 01:20:33.785
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake the fuck up!

01:20:33.959 --> 01:20:35.874
Drew!

01:20:48.539 --> 01:20:50.758
Wake the fuck up!

01:20:50.933 --> 01:20:52.673
Wake up, Drew!

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:55.633
Wake the fuck up,
you fucking princess!

01:20:58.549 --> 01:21:00.072
Please, Drew...

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:15.740
Drew! Wake up, Drew!

01:21:15.914 --> 01:21:20.484
Wake up!

01:21:27.708 --> 01:21:30.276
Drew.

01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:32.975
May!

01:21:36.630 --> 01:21:40.983
Drew.

01:21:41.157 --> 01:21:42.854
We did it.

01:21:51.732 --> 01:21:53.169
We're gonna live, Drew.

01:21:58.565 --> 01:22:00.741
We're just gonna stay in here
for a while.

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:02.656
Okay.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:09.359
And then I'm gonna
get us out of here.

01:22:15.843 --> 01:22:18.585
And, Drew...

01:22:18.759 --> 01:22:20.674
Next year I pick the spot.
