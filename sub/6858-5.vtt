WEBVTT

00:17.600 --> 00:19.977
ANNOUNCER: Desperate times
on Mandalore!

00:20.103 --> 00:22.938
Having won neutrality
for the Mandalorian system,

00:22.981 --> 00:27.776
Duchess Satine now finds herself
an outsider with little aid to her people.

00:27.819 --> 00:32.072
Supplies are impossible to come by,
except on the black market.

00:32.115 --> 00:36.076
As a result, the Duchess
faces a world consumed by greed.

00:36.619 --> 00:40.622
Hoping to alleviate some of the tensions
rising in the capital city of Sundari,

00:40.665 --> 00:43.667
Satine has called upon her friend
Padmé Amidala

00:43.793 --> 00:45.961
to make a diplomatic visit.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.274
Senator.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.777
Duchess. It's good to see you.

01:09.819 --> 01:12.279
Thank you for coming, Padmé.

01:12.572 --> 01:17.242
I know our decision to stay neutral
has caused distress in the Senate.

01:17.327 --> 01:21.455
But for many here, the fallout
from your war has been too much.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.249
If your government has trade concerns,
we can talk.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.959
Many systems have been affected.

01:28.004 --> 01:31.507
I assure you, not everyone in the Republic
has neglected Mandalore.

01:31.591 --> 01:35.636
And there are those of us who would
still vote to give you any help you require.

01:35.678 --> 01:40.349
The help we need now is opening trade
routes so we may get supplies more freely.

01:40.475 --> 01:43.185
We are making progress in the Senate.

01:43.269 --> 01:47.356
Forgive me, Padmé,
I did not bring you here to discuss politics.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.025
I had hoped to show you
the new Mandalore.

01:51.861 --> 01:54.446
Not the typical Mandalorian welcome.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.282
Senator Organa teased
you'd have a royal court waiting.

01:57.367 --> 02:01.703
I just wanted to greet you myself
before the others.

02:03.748 --> 02:06.708
(ALL CHEERING)

02:16.678 --> 02:19.346
Now, this is a Mandalorian welcome.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.141
We are a people of tradition.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.807
Hurry up. Get that stuff unloaded quickly.

03:09.105 --> 03:12.065
Here comes the customs official.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.905
Nice day here on Mandalore.

03:18.781 --> 03:21.617
It is, let's try not to ruin it.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.870
I don't get your meaning.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.955
Oh, I think you do.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.875
Your arrival isn't listed here
on my schedule.

03:29.959 --> 03:33.295
So what exactly are you unloading
on my dock?

03:34.047 --> 03:36.882
Must be a clerical oversight.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.509
I'm sure it won't happen again.

03:40.470 --> 03:44.306
Normally, there would be five times
as many officers out here.

03:44.390 --> 03:48.894
They're off at the parade.
Some big shot just arrived on Mandalore.

03:48.978 --> 03:50.020
You're lucky.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.104
(CHUCKLES)

03:51.231 --> 03:54.566
Luck has nothing to do with it.

03:54.651 --> 04:00.197
Well, just in case,
deal with me directly in the future. Got it?

04:00.281 --> 04:02.491
As you wish.

04:11.501 --> 04:15.003
Esteemed colleagues,
leaders of Mandalore, friends,

04:15.797 --> 04:18.882
I'm afraid our neutrality
has caused our people to suffer.

04:18.967 --> 04:23.762
The war between the Separatists and
the Republic rages across our galaxy.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.682
It has caused trade routes
to be closed to Mandalore.

04:26.766 --> 04:30.560
And has forced us to turn
to a black market filled with corruption.

04:30.645 --> 04:33.772
We know what is happening, Almec!
What will be done about it?

04:33.856 --> 04:38.068
Mandalore should not need
to pay smugglers to feed its people.

04:38.152 --> 04:41.321
It's not that we want to deal
with smugglers, we have no alternative.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.282
I'm sure you and the Trade Federation

04:43.366 --> 04:46.118
make a profit
whether our business is legitimate or not.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.619
I resent that!

04:47.704 --> 04:51.081
Ladies and gentlemen, please!
Order! Please!

04:51.165 --> 04:54.167
Prime Minister Almec
seems a bit overwhelmed.

04:54.252 --> 04:59.089
If you're volunteering your services
as a negotiator, please be my guest.

04:59.173 --> 05:02.050
Perhaps they will listen to a new voice.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.928
Ruling council! May I speak?

05:05.513 --> 05:07.222
Senator Amidala.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.935
The floor is yours.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.730
I hear your worries, your frustration.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.941
But the longer you argue,
the more your people suffer.

05:18.026 --> 05:21.236
You are right,
new trade routes are essential to survival.

05:21.321 --> 05:25.032
But the black market is no substitute
for legitimate and legal trade.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.533
What would you propose, Senator?

05:26.617 --> 05:28.660
The Republic can provide security.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.622
The Republic's own dealings with
the black market far surpass Mandalore's.

05:32.707 --> 05:36.209
I agree.
It's quite hypocritical of you to come here,

05:36.294 --> 05:40.130
a member of the Republic Senate,
and lecture to us about corruption.

05:40.214 --> 05:41.798
Mandalore cannot protect its...

05:41.883 --> 05:44.301
The black market is essential
to our survival.

05:44.385 --> 05:46.720
The corporate alliance
controls every nation!

05:46.804 --> 05:48.305
Silence!

05:51.893 --> 05:55.645
I told Senator Amidala
that Mandalore was not part of the war.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.607
Yet, here I find a battle in my own palace.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.026
I call this meeting adjourned.

06:01.110 --> 06:04.738
We will reconvene
and allow cooler heads to prevail.

06:15.249 --> 06:19.002
Come on, you worms,
get those barrels inside.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.719
What is this stuff?

06:27.804 --> 06:32.015
This "stuff" is slabin, a diluting agent.

06:32.100 --> 06:36.812
If we add it, we can make twice
as much tea at twice the profit.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.897
Isn't it toxic?

06:38.981 --> 06:39.981
(SCOFFS)

06:40.066 --> 06:44.486
Only if the dosage is wrong,
so get your mixture right.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.832
Tell me, Padmé.

06:56.916 --> 07:00.460
How do you feel about the Republic's war
with the Separatists?

07:00.545 --> 07:02.712
It's so complicated.

07:02.797 --> 07:07.008
As you know, in the Senate,
the Chancellor says it's going very well.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.344
But my sources say otherwise.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.596
And how does that make you feel?

07:12.265 --> 07:15.934
There are times
I wish I could follow Mandalore's lead.

07:16.018 --> 07:19.312
Neutrality, and not just in the war.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.523
But the politics as well?

07:21.607 --> 07:26.027
The contamination of greed
reaches deep and far within the Republic.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.530
Corporations, trade guilds,

07:28.614 --> 07:31.408
too many senators serving
their own interests.

07:31.909 --> 07:34.870
There are still those of us
who work to overcome the corruption

07:34.954 --> 07:37.998
and believe it to be possible.

07:38.082 --> 07:41.751
Enough of this dreary talk.
A new hospital has opened.

07:41.836 --> 07:45.797
Tomorrow, you and I shall visit,
see true good at work.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.549
It will do us good.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.990
-Orderly, what's going on here?
-I have no idea, Madam.

08:12.074 --> 08:15.368
Dr. Zaz is handling the outbreak.
He's inside.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.667
(PEOPLE COUGHING)

08:24.337 --> 08:25.337
(MOANING)

08:44.524 --> 08:45.899
What is happening here?

08:45.983 --> 08:49.611
Duchess, I'm sorry
no one has come to speak to you.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.531
-These children have been poisoned.
-How?

08:53.366 --> 08:57.035
We don't know.
And it's not just here, I'm afraid.

08:57.119 --> 08:59.246
We've gotten reports
from across the planet.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.123
Have you identified a cause?

09:02.208 --> 09:05.544
Well, the children here
all came from the same school.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.254
We're testing their food.

09:07.338 --> 09:10.423
If we find something,
perhaps we can create an antidote.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.509
But it will take some time.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.803
Which they may not have.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.682
What if it's not a poison?
It must be Death Watch.

09:18.766 --> 09:21.560
I'm not so sure.
In the past, the Death Watch attacks

09:21.644 --> 09:25.564
have only been directed at myself
and the administration, not the children.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.399
They are terrorists.

09:27.483 --> 09:30.068
Perhaps the senator's visit
has inspired them.

09:30.152 --> 09:34.239
Terrorists? Our minds should be on the
sick children that are dying in the streets.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.991
What are you going to do to save them?

09:36.867 --> 09:40.453
I must speak to the ruling council
about this matter.

09:42.748 --> 09:46.001
I refuse to believe that Death Watch
has anything to do with this.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.628
I agree. And his concern for the children...

09:48.713 --> 09:52.507
Was practically none.
All he thinks about is politics.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.926
Well, we can't just sit here and do nothing.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.886
My thoughts exactly.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.431
Thank you all for coming.

09:59.515 --> 10:02.100
I suppose you're wondering
why I asked you here.

10:02.184 --> 10:06.813
As my personal guards, you are the only
ones I can trust to investigate this matter.

10:06.897 --> 10:11.276
We have little time.
That is why I've asked for your help.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.402
Padmé.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.405
Each of you will be getting
a special comlink and datapad,

10:15.489 --> 10:19.326
means of direct communication
and locations you should investigate.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.661
This must be a closed-loop affair.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.913
Hundreds of children have been poisoned.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.582
They are our children.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.417
And they need our help.

10:27.501 --> 10:28.918
This is a Mandalorian matter,

10:29.003 --> 10:32.422
and we must find out
who dares poison our children.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.591
Thank you. Thank you all.

10:38.346 --> 10:41.056
-So where do we start?
-The schools.

10:48.522 --> 10:51.566
Thank you for allowing us
to inspect the school, Superintendant.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.777
My pleasure, Duchess.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.988
We've cleared the food here.
None of it is tainted.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.990
What about what they ate yesterday?

10:59.075 --> 11:01.368
The menu of food is pretty regular here.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.620
We would've caught something
with our tests.

11:03.704 --> 11:07.582
-What about their drinks, Doctor?
-No, they drink fresh water.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.751
It's impossible for it to be tainted.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.962
Not the water.
What about the bottled drinks?

11:13.047 --> 11:15.131
Those are not part of the school's menu.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.634
They are allowed
through an outside vendor.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.844
Excuse me, child.
I must borrow your drink.

11:37.613 --> 11:41.032
-How could this have happened?
-It's not your fault.

11:41.117 --> 11:46.454
I appreciate that. However,
for an outbreak of this size to occur...

11:46.539 --> 11:49.624
I'm afraid it's a sign
of a much, much deeper-seated corruption

11:49.667 --> 11:50.792
than I had imagined.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.669
Duchess, we've found something.

11:54.839 --> 11:58.341
This tea contains a high level of slabin.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.802
I didn't know slabin was lethal.

12:00.845 --> 12:04.973
It usually isn't, but mixed with
the tea and at this concentration,

12:05.015 --> 12:07.809
I'm certain
it's the cause of the children's illness.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.979
The school must have
an import log, correct?

12:11.021 --> 12:12.814
Yes, I believe so.

12:12.898 --> 12:15.650
So we should be able to find out
where the tea came from.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.361
Well, then let's get to the docks.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.995
Everything is here, Satine.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.706
Everything except the records
for the tea shipments.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.876
It looks like the school's import log
has been erased.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.211
There's no record of an outside vendor.

12:35.337 --> 12:38.089
Superintendent? Hold it right there!

12:38.382 --> 12:41.551
I'm actually on my way to the hospital.
I have to go.

12:42.678 --> 12:43.678
Stop him!

12:51.520 --> 12:52.896
Tell me what's going on here

12:53.022 --> 12:56.107
or else my guards will not be
as conversational as I am.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.359
-Satine!
-Padmé, please.

12:58.402 --> 12:59.694
Where did you get the tea?

12:59.737 --> 13:00.779
(SIGHS)

13:00.863 --> 13:04.407
Please, I never meant to harm anyone.
I just...

13:04.533 --> 13:08.745
I needed to cut costs.
The school's budget was too low.

13:08.871 --> 13:12.040
The school has received
sufficient government funding.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.082
(SIGHS)

13:13.250 --> 13:18.880
Look, they offered me a great deal.
I could keep some money for myself, too.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.299
But I didn't know
that the drinks were poison.

13:21.383 --> 13:23.551
All this because you were greedy?

13:23.677 --> 13:27.222
I'm not the only one making money
off this operation. There are others.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.723
More guilty than I am!

13:28.849 --> 13:30.391
Was Death Watch involved?

13:30.518 --> 13:31.726
Death Watch?

13:31.769 --> 13:36.523
I don't know, I dealt with a middleman.
An importer. His name's Siddiq.

13:36.565 --> 13:39.526
He works for a shipping company
not too far from here.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.402
Tell us where.

13:43.948 --> 13:47.575
Sure I bribed the school official.
What's the problem?

13:47.618 --> 13:49.577
What you've done is illegal.

13:49.703 --> 13:52.413
Beyond these stars,
there's a war going on.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.249
As long as my company imports goods,

13:54.375 --> 13:57.126
most people turn a blind eye
to anything else.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.921
We are not most people, Mr. Siddiq.

13:59.964 --> 14:03.883
My corporate contracts
protect me, Duchess.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.593
So I'll play your little game.

14:05.719 --> 14:09.430
Look, I'm sorry there are sick children.
I truly am.

14:09.473 --> 14:10.932
But I'm just a messenger.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.934
Where do you get the tea?

14:13.060 --> 14:15.812
From Mooga,
the Commerce Guild controls it.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.273
Here, I've nothing to hide.

14:18.315 --> 14:21.442
Here we are,
shipping schedules from Mooga.

14:21.485 --> 14:24.237
Right there, the highlighted ones.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.115
And a customs official reports these
to the government?

14:27.241 --> 14:28.324
As far as I know.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.743
Are these all for the ones
bringing in the tea?

14:30.786 --> 14:33.663
No. I'd have to narrow that down.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.666
Okay, okay, no problem.

14:37.668 --> 14:41.629
There you go. Look, they're actually
bringing in a shipment tonight.

14:43.173 --> 14:44.799
You want to know which dock?

14:51.265 --> 14:56.311
I must say, when I came to visit, I hadn't
pictured us in such an informal setting.

14:56.353 --> 14:59.314
Yes, well,
from what Master Kenobi tells me,

14:59.356 --> 15:04.527
during your tenure as Queen, you became
quite familiar with such excursions.

15:05.195 --> 15:09.324
One can only survive the rigors
of courtly formalities for so long.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.367
We are of the same mind.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.834
Duchess, there's a shipment arriving.

15:25.674 --> 15:28.343
-The smugglers.
-We'll soon find out.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.011
Shall I call in more security?

15:30.095 --> 15:33.348
No, let's wait and see what transpires.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.850
Look, a customs official.

15:45.527 --> 15:50.531
Welcome back, gentlemen.
I'm here for my inspection.

15:52.534 --> 15:56.037
Certainly. We would expect nothing less.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.846
How can they operate with such impunity?

16:13.889 --> 16:19.060
I need to find out how far up the chain
of command this corruption goes.

16:20.771 --> 16:24.148
I'm sorry, Duchess,
but what you're saying, it's impossible.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.276
Impossible? We witnessed it
with our own eyes.

16:27.361 --> 16:31.572
Bribery of a customs official
at the shipping docks? I'm afraid not.

16:31.657 --> 16:35.410
The docks are a highly secure area.
Free of dangerous criminals.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.328
But not free of corruption.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.748
The most dangerous weapon in the galaxy
is money, Captain.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.918
Smuggling does not take place
on my watch.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.920
And what about
when you're not watching?

16:46.005 --> 16:49.132
I'm always watching, Senator.

16:49.216 --> 16:53.428
And were you watching as children
were dying? Who was watching then?

16:53.512 --> 16:55.596
-Duchess, with all due respect...
-No, Captain!

16:55.681 --> 16:59.600
If you want my respect, you will arrest
these criminals and stop stalling.

16:59.685 --> 17:00.810
Stalling?

17:00.894 --> 17:05.440
Why else would you not be down there
with a patrol unit making arrests,

17:05.524 --> 17:07.442
unless you're involved?

17:07.484 --> 17:10.153
(SIGHS) All right, we'll see what's going on.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.544
Satine, what are those guards doing here?

17:27.004 --> 17:28.379
Did you order them here?

17:28.464 --> 17:31.299
Duchess, I've been with you
the whole time.

17:33.677 --> 17:36.095
Guards, let us into this warehouse.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.639
We're under strict orders
not to let anyone in.

17:38.724 --> 17:43.352
-Do you know who this is?
-I command you, open these doors!

17:43.479 --> 17:44.479
Um...

17:49.193 --> 17:50.860
Arrest them!

17:57.409 --> 17:58.993
Hold it right there!

19:06.061 --> 19:08.771
Impressive shooting for a senator.

19:17.906 --> 19:21.075
Captain, I want you to burn down
this warehouse.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.579
-Excuse me? But there's evidence...
-Burn it down,

19:24.621 --> 19:27.999
or I'll consider you
a part of this conspiracy, Captain.

19:28.083 --> 19:31.252
You heard her, men. Burn the warehouse.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.278
It wasn't Death Watch, Prime Minister.

19:57.321 --> 20:01.657
It was a group of black market smugglers.
They were diluting the drink with slabin.

20:01.783 --> 20:04.994
What they didn't count on was the process
would make the drinks poisonous.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.829
And what about the sick children?

20:06.955 --> 20:10.541
I ordered shipments of the antidote
for all the schools and hospitals.

20:10.626 --> 20:14.545
-I'm glad this is over.
-No, I'm afraid it's not over.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.797
The corruption
we witnessed is intolerable.

20:16.882 --> 20:20.718
Payoffs, police unwilling to comply,
my government fooled!

20:20.802 --> 20:22.053
How does this happen?

20:22.137 --> 20:25.056
I'm sorry.
I'm setting up a committee to look into it.

20:25.140 --> 20:29.060
Children nearly died because
our government cannot be counted on.

20:29.144 --> 20:31.979
I assure you this will not go unpunished.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.232
I'm counting on you, Almec.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.657
I'm troubled, Padmé.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.660
You heard Prime Minister Almec say
he'll investigate.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.704
His heart is in the right place,
but this corruption...

20:48.830 --> 20:53.376
-You must have hope, Satine.
-Hope will only go so far.

20:53.502 --> 20:57.463
The very people conducting
this investigation might be corrupt.

20:58.340 --> 21:02.343
Perhaps a Jedi working undercover at
the academy could be of service to us,

21:02.469 --> 21:04.220
and in more ways than one.

21:04.471 --> 21:09.016
For if we lose our young,
Mandalore will indeed be lost.

21:09.142 --> 21:13.354
I will speak with Master Yoda.
Don't lose hope, my friend.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.815
-Senator.
-Duchess.

22:04.906 --> 22:05.948
