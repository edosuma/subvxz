01:14.655 --> 01:17.095

01:17.775 --> 01:20.735
<i>Um, anyway, do give me a ring
when you get this.</i>

01:22.375 --> 01:23.575
What are you laughing at?

01:23.655 --> 01:26.855
Ah, where Vanessa scattered Ash's ashes.

01:28.615 --> 01:31.935
Looks like a police outline
of a dead body.

01:32.015 --> 01:33.375
- Yeah, it does.
- Like, I dunno,

01:33.455 --> 01:36.055
someone fell from the roof into the garden

01:36.135 --> 01:37.655
and... died.

01:37.735 --> 01:39.815
Yeah.

01:40.295 --> 01:42.735
Yeah! You'd better get to work.

01:42.815 --> 01:44.055
Why, what's...?

01:44.135 --> 01:46.095
Oh, wow,
I didn't realize it was so late.

01:47.295 --> 01:49.455
- See you guys later.
- Bye-bye.

01:50.135 --> 01:51.935
Can you just please stop doing that?

01:52.015 --> 01:54.215
I told you, I'm gonna
get you the money, okay?

01:56.375 --> 01:59.375
Well, until you do,
I'd like to have a bath.

02:00.695 --> 02:03.495
Okay. Fine. You know where it is.

02:04.135 --> 02:05.975
I want you to run it for me.

02:17.055 --> 02:20.135
Why did Daddy change his passcode,
Benny?

02:21.735 --> 02:23.015
What was he up to?

02:23.935 --> 02:25.215
Will!

02:25.295 --> 02:26.855
Your bath's ready.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.375
Fucking half-faced prick.

02:29.855 --> 02:31.055
You called?

02:32.855 --> 02:34.895
Yeah. Your bath's ready.

02:36.015 --> 02:37.375
Thank you, Daniel.

02:39.135 --> 02:40.215
Well?

02:40.295 --> 02:41.855
Don't just stand there.

02:42.415 --> 02:43.695
Get undressed.

02:46.175 --> 02:47.215
What?

02:47.815 --> 02:49.455
We're gonna take a bath together.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.295
Joke!

03:01.215 --> 03:02.375
Now get out.

03:12.375 --> 03:13.655
Annette!

03:13.735 --> 03:15.015
I'm back from my run.

03:16.615 --> 03:17.855
In here, darling.

03:17.935 --> 03:20.455
Oh, this fitness bracelet is...

03:21.055 --> 03:22.455
50 meters.

03:26.295 --> 03:27.295
No, you haven't.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.415
I have.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.535
You've bought me a bike!

03:31.815 --> 03:33.855
Oh, I love it!

03:34.655 --> 03:37.095
And I got you these too.

03:37.855 --> 03:40.415
Now, you have to promise me
to wear the helmet at all times.

03:40.495 --> 03:43.855
I don't want anything happening
to that beautiful head of yours.

03:43.935 --> 03:47.135
Oh! Oh, it's got a little camera.

03:47.935 --> 03:49.375
I can film my bike rides.

03:49.455 --> 03:50.855
Hello!

03:52.135 --> 03:54.255
- Oh, Annette, I love you.
- Oh!

03:55.495 --> 03:58.935
So can we pay, um,
for our club membership soon?

03:59.015 --> 04:00.815
It's just Â£6,000 for the year.

04:01.695 --> 04:02.735
Right.

04:03.495 --> 04:06.535
- That okay? Can we afford it?
- Um...

04:06.615 --> 04:09.055
Yes, yes. Yes, of course we can.

04:10.535 --> 04:12.655
- I love you too.
- Oh, I...

04:15.695 --> 04:17.255
No, Iain, Iain, I've got to get on.

04:17.334 --> 04:18.535
Please, just a...

04:18.615 --> 04:20.695
We'll come back to this later.

04:30.775 --> 04:33.895
Michael, this is just what you wanted.
Did you leak that story?

04:33.975 --> 04:35.215
Because I think you did.

04:35.295 --> 04:38.375
Er, well, no I can assure you,
Miss West, I...

04:38.455 --> 04:40.855
I am as distraught as you are.

04:40.935 --> 04:43.855
Michael, when a gorilla lies,
it scratches its ear.

04:44.375 --> 04:46.695
Well, I did not want this, okay?

04:46.775 --> 04:49.575
My wife is furious now that she knows

04:49.655 --> 04:51.655
my daughter saw Kenny in his...

04:52.455 --> 04:54.815
state of deathly ecstasy.

04:54.895 --> 04:55.895
Whatever.

04:55.975 --> 04:57.535
It is what it is. It is what it is.

04:57.615 --> 04:59.815
Oh, I have to take that.

04:59.895 --> 05:01.175
It's a family call.

05:01.255 --> 05:03.255
It's my office. It's my...

05:03.335 --> 05:04.575
This...

05:04.655 --> 05:06.215
But, yeah, I'll give you some space.

05:06.295 --> 05:08.375
Hi, babies. Mummy's coming home soon.

05:09.575 --> 05:11.255
Ryan! Ryan, that's your sister!

05:11.335 --> 05:12.895
Oh, God. No, don't lick it!

05:15.495 --> 05:18.215
Where have you been?
You can get me a cranberry juice.

05:18.295 --> 05:19.295
What?

05:21.895 --> 05:24.655
I thought you were Daniel.
What are you doing here?

05:24.735 --> 05:27.615
I decided to have lunch at home.
Have you eaten?

05:27.695 --> 05:28.855
Not yet.

05:28.935 --> 05:30.335
Do you want me to make you some eggs?

05:30.735 --> 05:32.895
Oh... yes, please, Becca!

05:32.975 --> 05:34.615
- Thank you.
- Okay.

05:39.855 --> 05:42.695
So he knows everything?
Absolutely everything?

05:43.495 --> 05:44.895
Yeah.

05:44.975 --> 05:46.455
This is not good, Daniel.

05:49.615 --> 05:51.295
This is not good at all.

05:52.415 --> 05:55.095
I'd already started work
on your new scans.

05:55.175 --> 05:56.895
I'd booked in your fake "surgery" too.

05:56.975 --> 05:59.335
Yeah, we could still do that. First...

06:00.455 --> 06:01.815
Will wants money.

06:02.295 --> 06:03.455
He what what?

06:04.615 --> 06:06.095
And then he will leave us alone.

06:07.175 --> 06:08.975
I think he's a bit

06:09.055 --> 06:10.255
unhinged.

06:10.335 --> 06:12.975
Oh, he's unhinged? You don't say.
Do you remember this?

06:15.095 --> 06:16.215
You remember this?

06:16.975 --> 06:19.295
Yeah, I know.

06:19.375 --> 06:20.775
What is that noise?

06:20.855 --> 06:23.295
Oh, it's an application on my phone.

06:23.375 --> 06:26.335
It reminds me to drink water,
stay hydrated.

06:26.415 --> 06:27.575
How much does he want?

06:27.655 --> 06:28.735
Ten grand.

06:28.815 --> 06:30.975
Then just pay him. You've got
your We Cover insurance money.

06:31.055 --> 06:33.415
It's all gone.
Ash's funeral cleaned me out.

06:35.775 --> 06:38.015
Oh, right, and you think I have it?

06:38.775 --> 06:42.495
You're a doctor. You know,
you must earn pretty good money.

06:44.255 --> 06:45.455
Well, I don't.

06:46.935 --> 06:49.375
Okay, what about some drugs we can sell?

06:49.455 --> 06:53.215
Like medicinal cocaine,
heroin, methadone...

06:53.295 --> 06:55.495
Yeah, yeah! Right here in my drawer.

06:55.575 --> 06:56.815
Full of methadone.

06:56.895 --> 07:00.015
This one's full of ecstasy
and this one's got cocaine in it

07:00.095 --> 07:01.255
and there's gold bars in there

07:01.335 --> 07:04.215
and in the corner I've got a big bazooka,
should the plop-plop really hit the fan.

07:04.295 --> 07:05.535
Yeah, well, what is all that?

07:06.615 --> 07:10.255
That is your cancer medication.
I've been meaning to throw it away,

07:10.335 --> 07:12.415
but I haven't had a chance
to smuggle it to my car.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.655
Is it... is it worth anything?

07:14.735 --> 07:18.175
Well, yes, I mean, of course it is.
Who's going to buy stolen cancer drugs?

07:18.935 --> 07:20.255
Drug dealer might.

07:21.735 --> 07:24.055
<i>Nah, I'm not interested in cancer meds.</i>

07:24.135 --> 07:26.135
Okay, but do you know anyone who is?

07:26.215 --> 07:28.135
- <i>Yeah, Shank.</i>
- Sorry, who?

07:28.215 --> 07:29.695
- <i>Shank.</i>
- He's called Shank?

07:29.775 --> 07:32.495
<i>Yeah, Shank. Like a prison knife.
I'll set up a meeting.</i>

07:32.935 --> 07:33.895
Thanks.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.775
<i>Now, listen, it's half price on Moroccan.</i>

07:39.615 --> 07:42.135
<i>Hey, son, just your old dad again.</i>

07:42.215 --> 07:46.175
<i>Just wondering if you had time
for that chat any time soon?</i>

07:46.255 --> 07:47.535
<i>Let me know.</i>

07:54.775 --> 07:55.735
Argh!

07:58.255 --> 07:59.535
As if this will work.

07:59.615 --> 08:01.375
One, two, three, four.

08:01.455 --> 08:02.935
Oh, my God! Yes! Yes!

08:03.015 --> 08:05.775
No! No!

08:06.975 --> 08:08.015
No!

08:16.895 --> 08:17.855
Oh!

08:26.895 --> 08:29.215
No, no, no!

08:30.615 --> 08:32.495
I wanna talk about stress thumbs.

08:32.855 --> 08:36.934
Well, Mr. West was trying to get
them into development but...

08:37.015 --> 08:38.174
Common sense won out.

08:38.255 --> 08:39.375
Shut up.

08:39.455 --> 08:42.335
I like them. It's really hard
to get gorillas to take medicine,

08:42.414 --> 08:43.414
and this could really help.

08:43.495 --> 08:46.175
Plus, if it works on the gorillas,
we can try it on humans.

08:46.255 --> 08:47.575
- Yes.
- Really?

08:47.655 --> 08:50.455
Because your father
didn't think they were a good idea.

08:50.535 --> 08:53.495
No, but he did think that strangling
himself while masturbating

08:53.575 --> 08:55.655
- was a good idea.
- True, yeah.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.295
Um, I'm just not sure
that thumbs for monkeys

08:58.375 --> 09:00.015
are going to get We Cover stock back up.

09:00.095 --> 09:01.935
Michael, can you just give us the room?

09:02.615 --> 09:04.575
Okay. Well, yeah, just...

09:05.255 --> 09:06.855
enjoy my office.

09:08.015 --> 09:11.015
This company's full of Michaels.
I want more Lindas.

09:11.535 --> 09:13.255
So any other ideas you have?

09:14.255 --> 09:15.935
Well, actually...

09:16.735 --> 09:17.855
Presenting...

09:19.655 --> 09:20.935
the office bracelet.

09:21.015 --> 09:25.215
It has a torch for finding stationery
in dark cupboards

09:25.295 --> 09:26.535
and it's magnetized...

09:28.815 --> 09:29.815
for paperclips.

09:29.895 --> 09:31.575
That's... that's fantastic.

09:32.135 --> 09:33.175
Keep thinking, though.

09:33.255 --> 09:37.015
Also, I wanna let you know
Michael's office is now yours.

09:38.615 --> 09:39.695
So take a seat.

09:40.375 --> 09:41.575
Thanks.

09:42.975 --> 09:44.295
Okay, see you soon.

09:47.535 --> 09:48.975
So how long have you been doing this for?

09:49.055 --> 09:50.375
Two years.

09:50.455 --> 09:52.455
I'm trying to rid my body of pollutants.

09:53.615 --> 09:56.935
Eggs are nature's
purest food source, so...

10:04.215 --> 10:05.735
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

10:05.815 --> 10:07.535
- What for?
- Staring.

10:07.615 --> 10:09.895
- It's okay. I'm used to it.
- I just...

10:11.175 --> 10:12.615
I want to see.

10:17.615 --> 10:19.575
Please, Becca...

10:19.655 --> 10:20.775
I won't be scared.

10:34.215 --> 10:35.535
Now do you trust me?

10:37.215 --> 10:38.255
No.

10:40.735 --> 10:42.415
Oh, what the fuck is wrong with me?

10:50.770 --> 10:54.010
Feel like we're in an episode
of <i>Cagney & Lacey.</i>

10:56.530 --> 10:57.810
Right.

10:58.290 --> 11:01.010
What is this... drug dealer's name?

11:01.090 --> 11:02.170
Sh...

11:04.090 --> 11:05.690
Timothy something.

11:05.770 --> 11:08.570
Good. Please don't use my real name.

11:08.650 --> 11:11.290
He cannot know anything about me.

11:11.370 --> 11:14.650
Can you just stop being so dramatic?
Okay, my weed dealer said he's fine.

11:14.730 --> 11:16.610
Let me just point something out to you.

11:16.690 --> 11:19.730
This is a man who makes
his money by selling drugs.

11:21.130 --> 11:23.050
Could you just turn that thing off?

11:24.730 --> 11:26.490
No, I won't. I'm staying hydrated.

11:27.290 --> 11:29.170
Don't get mad at me.
This is all your fault.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.770
<i>My</i> fault? Who was it
that misdiagnosed me with cancer?

11:31.850 --> 11:33.090
How many times? Hmm?

11:33.170 --> 11:35.570
Once. It was an honest mistake.

11:35.650 --> 11:37.530
Yeah, which has led to this.

11:38.250 --> 11:39.610
- Look, I'm...
- No!

11:39.690 --> 11:41.090
- No, give it to me.
- Don't you dare!

11:41.170 --> 11:43.610
- Give it to me.
- Give it me back! Get off!

11:45.450 --> 11:46.450
Oh!

11:47.210 --> 11:48.490
Right.

11:49.410 --> 11:50.770
I'm sorry, okay?

11:53.530 --> 11:55.610
Well, congratulations.

11:56.450 --> 11:57.690
Now you've got your wish.

11:58.690 --> 12:00.250
Let's get this over and done with,
shall we?

12:01.010 --> 12:02.250
And please,

12:02.330 --> 12:03.890
keep a low bloody profile.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.570
I'm bloody wet in the willy!

12:12.050 --> 12:14.130
I'm sorry. Please come out.

12:24.530 --> 12:26.050
I don't know what you must think of me.

12:26.570 --> 12:28.210
What with Daniel being sick. But...

12:29.450 --> 12:30.730
I'm just so confused.

12:31.410 --> 12:34.530
We'd split up and then he got his bad news
and I couldn't just leave him alone.

12:35.050 --> 12:36.210
I get it.

12:36.290 --> 12:37.330
But I...

12:38.250 --> 12:40.330
I don't think I want to be with him
any more.

12:41.930 --> 12:43.330
I want to be with you.

12:45.250 --> 12:46.250
Why?

12:46.330 --> 12:48.610
You're... you're just like no one
I've ever met before.

12:49.090 --> 12:50.890
- Because of the mask?
- No!

12:52.930 --> 12:55.050
Well, maybe that is a part of it, but...

12:55.530 --> 12:57.850
- Have you heard of Florence Nightingale?
- What?

12:57.930 --> 12:59.250
She was this nurse who...

12:59.330 --> 13:01.490
No, I know who Florence Nightingale was.

13:01.570 --> 13:03.770
Well, they call it
the Florence Nightingale effect

13:03.850 --> 13:05.970
when people are turned on
by sick people like me.

13:06.050 --> 13:08.810
No, I don't just like you
because you have a disfigured face.

13:14.490 --> 13:16.610
Willy water! Hello.

13:18.290 --> 13:19.690
Please do not use my real name.

13:19.770 --> 13:20.930
For the hundredth time, I won't.

13:27.290 --> 13:28.490
Hello. Hello.

13:28.570 --> 13:31.730
- Hi. We're here to see Shank.
- Shank?

13:32.690 --> 13:34.250
Yeah, Shank.

13:35.530 --> 13:37.250
- Yeah.
- After you!

13:37.850 --> 13:39.850
Oh, it's not what you think.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.690
It's water. I spilt my water bottle.

13:42.770 --> 13:44.490
- Come in!
- Oh, fine, I'm going in.

13:44.890 --> 13:47.770
Hello. Ooh, a bit gloomy in here,
isn't it?

13:49.170 --> 13:50.530
Pop a light on.

13:50.610 --> 13:52.290
Tell me, which way are we headed?

13:53.250 --> 13:54.330
Thankingtons!

13:55.570 --> 13:56.610
You got 'roid rage?

13:56.690 --> 13:58.090
- Please shut up.
- Yes, of course.

14:01.930 --> 14:03.250
Ah!

14:04.490 --> 14:05.810
Hello.

14:06.450 --> 14:07.850
You must be Daniel.

14:09.410 --> 14:11.010
And you are?

14:11.090 --> 14:12.330
Dr. Iain Glennis.

14:13.490 --> 14:14.850
No, I mean...

14:14.930 --> 14:17.650
Doctor? This should be good stuff, then.

14:19.530 --> 14:22.130
- Can I see it?
- Yeah, yeah.

14:22.210 --> 14:23.730
Show him the shit.

14:25.890 --> 14:27.970
Oh!

14:29.130 --> 14:30.490
Oh, my word!

14:30.570 --> 14:32.690
Excellent, excellent.

14:32.770 --> 14:35.450
I'm in up to my eyeballs in Citalopram,

14:35.530 --> 14:37.650
Demerol, but Docetaxel...

14:37.730 --> 14:41.610
that's a little bit harder
to get your hands on!

14:49.610 --> 14:50.610
Ah!

14:53.090 --> 14:56.170
- Just trying to stay hydrated.
- Yes, very wise.

14:56.250 --> 14:58.410
Ha ha! You should know!

15:00.690 --> 15:03.050
So, er, your name's Shank, is it?

15:03.130 --> 15:04.730
Yes, short for Shankowic.

15:04.810 --> 15:07.490
My dad's from Belarus. Hey!

15:07.570 --> 15:11.490
No, but seriously, you're not really
a doctor, are you?

15:11.570 --> 15:14.530
No, I am, yes.
Private clinic. St. Frederick's.

15:15.090 --> 15:17.770
St. Frederick's? Isn't that in Waterloo?

15:17.850 --> 15:19.610
No, it's Baker Street, but...

15:20.330 --> 15:22.610
- I know it, I know it.
- I don't...

15:22.690 --> 15:24.850
Well, I'll have to come and visit you
next time I'm ill.

15:24.930 --> 15:25.890
Oh!

15:28.050 --> 15:31.370
Okay, right, just leave this with me
and I'll see if I can shift it.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.250
How... how much do we get?

15:33.330 --> 15:35.730
That depends. There's a big market
for it in the US,

15:35.810 --> 15:37.890
but also Turkey, Tunisia.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.530
Ba ba ba ba ba ba...

15:39.610 --> 15:41.450
Mmm... Ten grand.

15:44.850 --> 15:47.530
Ten? Ten?

15:52.770 --> 15:54.250
I could go higher.

15:56.130 --> 15:57.370
Fifteen.

15:57.450 --> 16:01.410
But remember, I've got to source buyers,
etc, etc.

16:02.050 --> 16:03.290
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

16:06.450 --> 16:08.530
If you can go to 20,000,

16:08.930 --> 16:10.410
you've got yourself a deal.

16:12.450 --> 16:14.090
Seventeen...

16:15.010 --> 16:16.970
and you've got yourself a deal.

16:17.050 --> 16:20.330
Nineteen thousand
and you've got yourself a deal.

16:21.090 --> 16:22.250
Eighteen.

16:22.730 --> 16:24.530
You got yourself a deal.

16:25.290 --> 16:26.650
Congratulations.

16:30.690 --> 16:31.730
Oh!

16:32.490 --> 16:33.970
Don't forget to stay hydrated.

16:35.490 --> 16:37.050
I see you already are.

16:38.170 --> 16:39.610
Yes, I spilt my...

16:49.850 --> 16:53.130
<i>Okay, you need to take your phone
and put it into a big bowl of rice</i>

16:53.210 --> 16:55.290
<i>to extract all of that naughty moisture.</i>

16:55.370 --> 16:58.850
<i>Just leave it in there for 72 hours
before you try turning it on again.</i>

16:58.930 --> 17:00.530
<i>What's better than
a three-day phone detox?</i>

17:00.610 --> 17:02.130
Fuck's sake! Three days?

17:02.210 --> 17:04.329
<i>Get outside, commune with nature,</i>

17:04.410 --> 17:06.890
<i>maybe spend some face-to-face time
with your loved ones</i>

17:06.970 --> 17:08.170
<i>instead of FaceTime.</i>

17:08.250 --> 17:09.329
Twat!

17:42.570 --> 17:45.530
Your face! It's fine! What the fuck?

17:46.090 --> 17:48.130
Give me that back! Give it!

17:50.450 --> 17:53.770
You tell a soul about this and I'll tell
everyone you tried to rape me!

17:55.890 --> 17:57.610
You and Daniel deserve each other!

17:58.330 --> 18:00.330
Ash probably didn't even fall
from the window.

18:00.410 --> 18:03.530
He probably jumped
to get away from you cunts!

18:08.730 --> 18:09.970
He was a nice chap, wasn't he?

18:10.050 --> 18:11.930
- Couldn't have gone better.
- No, no.

18:12.010 --> 18:13.890
- Four grand each.
- Pardon?

18:13.970 --> 18:17.810
Ten grand for Will,
then eight divided by two is four.

18:19.690 --> 18:21.250
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

18:22.330 --> 18:23.410
No. You see...

18:24.810 --> 18:27.690
I'm the one
that put everything on the line.

18:29.050 --> 18:32.690
You get 10,000 for your lunatic friend
and the rest is mine.

18:32.770 --> 18:34.250
- But...
- Ah!

18:34.890 --> 18:37.690
Did you split the 30,000
you got from We Cover with me?

18:37.770 --> 18:38.930
No, you didn't.

18:39.850 --> 18:42.570
If we do this again,
then we'll split everything 50/50.

18:43.090 --> 18:45.770
Those are my terms. It's only fair.

18:46.770 --> 18:47.930
Fine.

18:48.010 --> 18:49.970
And you can buy me a new water bottle.

18:51.810 --> 18:53.410
Oh, come in, Michael.

18:54.290 --> 18:56.010
Er... thanks.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.530
Oh, I was looking in there
for a soldering iron,

19:00.610 --> 19:03.290
but I just found bedding and pajamas.

19:03.370 --> 19:06.690
Oh, yes, well, er, things
are a little bit tricky at home

19:06.770 --> 19:10.290
and... I work late in the office anyway,

19:10.370 --> 19:14.490
so just, you know, might as well
sleep here for a few days.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.370
Office sleepover. That's fun.

19:16.890 --> 19:19.490
Yeah, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell Miss We...

19:20.090 --> 19:22.490
This bracelet.
What's the little nub on the wrist?

19:22.570 --> 19:24.930
Oh, yeah, I'm trying to fix that.
It's where the magnet is hidden.

19:25.010 --> 19:28.010
Also the magnet's too powerful.
It's made out of rare earth.

19:28.090 --> 19:30.250
Well, I think it hits a pressure point
that relieves anxiety.

19:30.330 --> 19:32.130
I mean, I've been wearing it all day
and I feel great.

19:32.210 --> 19:33.730
Wow! Really?

19:33.810 --> 19:36.410
Because I was hoping to disguise it
with a staple remover.

19:36.490 --> 19:37.930
No staple remover.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.010
We're going to bring back
the charity bracelet,

19:41.090 --> 19:42.730
but one that actually does something.

19:42.810 --> 19:43.930
Charity bracelet?

19:44.010 --> 19:45.690
Yeah, you know.
They did it for cancer, AIDS...

19:45.770 --> 19:47.850
Oh, yeah, I remember.

19:47.930 --> 19:49.570
I used to wear one
because I loved the colour,

19:49.650 --> 19:53.370
but then I found out it was for a charity
that wanted to bring back hanging.

19:53.450 --> 19:54.570
And we need a slogan.

19:54.650 --> 19:56.090
Sort of like "live strong."

19:56.170 --> 19:58.370
No, Michael, it's already been done,
you asshole. Jesus!

19:58.930 --> 20:00.490
Yeah, it was an example.

20:00.570 --> 20:02.250
What about "live a great life?"

20:02.730 --> 20:04.930
Yes. Live a great life.

20:05.010 --> 20:07.690
That's perfect. I love it.
Let's go celebrate.

20:08.730 --> 20:12.770
Okay, well, I'm just gonna hang back
and reply to some...

20:13.410 --> 20:15.970
emails. You go ahead.

20:17.810 --> 20:20.090
Oh, and Michael, please don't sleep
in the office any more.

20:20.170 --> 20:21.930
It's embarrassing. You look poor.

20:25.490 --> 20:26.570
Mmm!

20:27.290 --> 20:29.530
Oh... yeah.

20:29.610 --> 20:31.450
Where have you been? I've missed you.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.090
Well, you know, just doing...

20:34.170 --> 20:36.090
- some stuff.
- Mm-hm?

20:36.610 --> 20:38.410
Where... where's Will?

20:38.490 --> 20:40.210
Oh, I don't know. I haven't seen him.

20:40.290 --> 20:42.290
I came back
and all his stuff had disappeared.

20:42.810 --> 20:44.690
What happened? It's so weird.

20:44.770 --> 20:46.090
I've got no idea.

20:46.850 --> 20:49.770
Maybe he... maybe he
took that flight to Germany.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.890
I mean, it's weird he didn't say goodbye,
but you know,

20:52.970 --> 20:54.930
it's because he's... because he's...

20:55.770 --> 20:57.010
a weirdo.

20:59.690 --> 21:00.810
Yeah.

21:02.810 --> 21:04.410
Darling, I'm home.

21:06.970 --> 21:08.370
Where have you been?

21:08.450 --> 21:10.330
Oh, er, nowhere. Nowhere in particular.

21:11.010 --> 21:14.170
Just, er, picking up some membership forms

21:15.090 --> 21:17.930
so my beautiful wife, you,

21:18.010 --> 21:24.010
and I, can become members
of Barlow Lake Country Club.

21:25.210 --> 21:26.370
Iain...

21:26.890 --> 21:29.250
- I love you.
- Oh!

21:29.810 --> 21:31.810
Everything's getting back
to how it used to be.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.530
Oh!

21:37.490 --> 21:38.810
Shush!

21:38.890 --> 21:39.930
Oh...

21:41.850 --> 21:44.730
<i>Hello. You're through to 07700...</i>

21:44.810 --> 21:45.810
Fuck!

21:48.530 --> 21:50.490
Oh, finally!

21:51.090 --> 21:53.450
Where are you?
I've been trying to call you for ages.

21:53.530 --> 21:55.090
<i>I don't think you have.</i>

21:55.890 --> 21:58.210
Oh. Sorry, who... who is this?

21:58.290 --> 21:59.530
<i>It's Will.</i>

22:00.970 --> 22:01.970
Will?

22:03.330 --> 22:06.250
Where have you been?
What is up with your voice?

22:06.890 --> 22:08.250
I've got your money, okay?

22:08.330 --> 22:09.530
<i>Ten grand?</i>

22:09.610 --> 22:12.650
<i>I can get ten times that
and screw you over in the process.</i>

22:13.050 --> 22:14.930
<i>Everyone's gonna learn the truth
about you.</i>

22:15.010 --> 22:17.570
<i>You're fucked... dude.</i>
