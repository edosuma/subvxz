00:02.200 --> 00:04.159
Mini, I love you.

00:04.160 --> 00:06.839
'Jesus, farm boy. Talk about
ruining the mood.'

00:08.000 --> 00:09.279
Just drive.

00:09.280 --> 00:12.519
I know what she said, all right?
But she's not available.

00:12.520 --> 00:15.999
She's my girlfriend and you lot
just fuck with her head.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.039
I don't want you here.
I never wanted you at all,

00:19.040 --> 00:20.319
do you understand?

00:20.320 --> 00:24.319
I'm in this class.
Well, I've been away for a bit.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.479
Like, on holiday.

00:26.480 --> 00:28.079
I've missed you so much.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.239
'Farm boy?'

00:30.240 --> 00:33.599
Come down. I want to talk.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.279
I'm telling you I'm sorry.

00:35.280 --> 00:39.079
It's too fucking
exhausting loving you.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.719
I don't think you know
how to love anything.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.919
Who have you told, Mini?

00:43.920 --> 00:45.559
Have you told anyone?

00:45.560 --> 00:49.559
I haven't told myself.

Whoo!

02:03.560 --> 02:06.199
Mini! Mini!

02:06.200 --> 02:10.199
Come dance!

02:12.000 --> 02:15.999
Mini!

02:20.920 --> 02:23.599
I don't give a shit, mate.
Like none of the shits.

02:23.600 --> 02:27.199
I've got no more shits for that girl.
You know, I don't get it.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.199
We used to have jokes,
like proper fucking jokes.

02:31.200 --> 02:35.199
And now it's just... I don't know.
Reality drama bullshit.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.639
Al, I didn't wanna tell you this
when you were all smitten and shit

02:38.640 --> 02:41.719
but you can do better, man.

02:41.720 --> 02:42.839
For reals?

02:42.840 --> 02:46.839
For fucking reals. Why not?

02:46.840 --> 02:50.839
What about her?

02:51.480 --> 02:54.839
Who?

02:54.840 --> 02:58.359
Her.

02:58.360 --> 03:02.359
She's eye-fucking you, man.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.759
Fuck, man. She's coming over.
Look, she's coming over.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.159
Fucking be cool.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.239
Hey.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.119
Wanna monkey-fuck?

03:22.120 --> 03:23.679
What?

03:23.680 --> 03:26.399
I'm desperado for a light here.

03:26.400 --> 03:30.399
Yeah, sure.

03:39.640 --> 03:43.159
You know there are 12 other
douchebags dressed as Peter Pan?

03:43.160 --> 03:45.719
Oh, yeah, but they're just wannabes.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.799
You wanna know a secret?

03:47.800 --> 03:50.079
Always.

03:50.080 --> 03:53.959
Found a... secret stash of bevvies.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.919
Gonna make a cocktail.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.959
You want in?

03:57.960 --> 04:01.959
Cha!

04:04.440 --> 04:05.719
Better?

04:05.720 --> 04:09.719
Much better.

04:12.440 --> 04:16.439
Little bit of this,
little bit of that.

04:16.519 --> 04:18.439
Are you trying to get me drunk
so you can get in my pants?

04:18.440 --> 04:21.238
Oh, no. That's what the rohypnol's
for. This is just for jokes.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.079
Very mature...

04:35.080 --> 04:39.079
farm boy.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.679
Oh. Er... Mini McGuinness.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.039
This is...

04:45.040 --> 04:46.999
Poppy Champion.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.999
Poppy Champion.

04:52.560 --> 04:56.559
Well, um... enjoy your beer
and bants, then.

05:24.120 --> 05:27.319
So.

05:27.320 --> 05:31.319
So.

05:43.080 --> 05:47.079
It's been fun.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.839
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

06:56.840 --> 07:00.839
Dewi tried to off-road the van
this morning. Totally fucked it.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.679
So, er... we're stuck with Betsy.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.599
You own a tractor?
I know. It's properly jokes.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.359
I love tractors.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.599
Fancy a lift, Tink?

07:43.720 --> 07:47.599
What's the plan, Peter Pan?

07:47.600 --> 07:51.599
Well. I thought we could
munch this shiz alfresco.

07:51.880 --> 07:55.879
Fancy. Are you trying to impress me?

07:56.640 --> 07:59.559
I don't need to try.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.879
Onwards to Neverland!

08:02.880 --> 08:04.519
Fuck! Whoa! Ow!

08:04.520 --> 08:07.639
Fucking sweat balls! Ow!

08:07.640 --> 08:09.839
Does it hurt? Oh!

08:09.840 --> 08:12.479
No.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.439
You're it. What?

08:16.440 --> 08:18.679
Come on, Alo!
Oh, you cheat!

08:27.760 --> 08:29.399
Poppy! Oi!

08:39.480 --> 08:43.479
Come on!

08:50.520 --> 08:54.519
Come on!

09:00.280 --> 09:02.879
Pretty average land-boy lifestyle,
really.

09:02.880 --> 09:05.319
Got my mum. My dad.

09:05.320 --> 09:08.279
Four cows. Bunch of sheep
and chickens.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.319
Oh, and Rags, my dog.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.199
We got a Labrador once, but my dad
gave him to an old folks' home

09:13.200 --> 09:15.079
cos he crapped in his bed.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.719
Bet he was the shit.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.439
We called him Napoleon
cos he was so little.

09:18.440 --> 09:22.439
Oh, little dogs are badass.
I know, right?

09:23.800 --> 09:25.839
Hey, you wanna see me
do a handstand?

09:25.840 --> 09:29.839
Um... yeah.

09:35.320 --> 09:38.759
Ta-da!
How life-altering was that?

09:41.920 --> 09:44.079
You're like...

09:44.080 --> 09:45.999
really weird.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.919
I know you are.
No, I mean like a compliment.

09:48.920 --> 09:52.159
A lot... a lot of girls would hate
this, not rom coming it,

09:52.160 --> 09:54.639
just hanging out, having jokes.

09:54.640 --> 09:58.639
You talking about a lot of girls
or just Wendy?

09:59.400 --> 10:01.719
What?

10:01.720 --> 10:04.799
Well, the bombshell who chitchatted
with us in Neverland.

10:04.800 --> 10:08.799
Well, she's your ex, right?

10:11.480 --> 10:14.839
Well, you don't have to tell me
if it's too like emo or whatever.

10:14.840 --> 10:18.839
No! Um... no. Look, we weren't even
really together. It was all physical.

10:20.040 --> 10:24.039
She has a serious case of libido
bipolar, hot and cold all the time.

10:25.520 --> 10:29.519
I was like her West Country whore,
fuckable just as long
as nobody found out.

10:50.560 --> 10:53.879
So, um...

10:53.880 --> 10:57.719
I mean, I'm... I'm just throwing this
out there, but...

10:57.720 --> 11:01.719
do you want to make this thing
official?

11:02.320 --> 11:04.999
Are you asking me
to be your girlfriend, Alo?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.119
Maybe.

11:07.120 --> 11:10.719
Do you want to?

11:10.720 --> 11:12.799
Wait.

11:12.800 --> 11:16.799
There's something else
I wanna do first.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.359
'Meet Joe Jonas!

12:05.360 --> 12:07.199
'Excellent!'

12:35.160 --> 12:37.599
Oh, fuck! Fuck, I'm going to come!

12:37.600 --> 12:39.879
Fuck, yeah!
Oh!

12:42.640 --> 12:45.079
Oh.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.799
Oh, no.
Oh, yes!

12:57.800 --> 12:59.399
Yes, yes!

12:59.400 --> 13:02.039
Oh, fuck!

13:02.040 --> 13:05.479
Yes!

13:05.480 --> 13:07.519
What... what the fuck?

13:07.520 --> 13:11.519
Chill out. I never use a condom.
It's no biggie.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.919
No, no, no, no! Don't touch me! Don't
touch me! Don't touch me. Stay there.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.599
Stay there, stay there. OK. OK.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.799
Oh. OK.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.799
Just tell me exactly...

13:23.800 --> 13:25.599
how old are you?

13:25.600 --> 13:28.079
I'm 14. Almost.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.079
Oh, my God! You're 13!

13:30.080 --> 13:31.759
I don't get it. What's the drama?

13:31.760 --> 13:34.279
Of course you don't get it.
You're a child.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.759
I'm not a child. I can get
the adult menu at Pizza Hut.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.599
What the fuck?

13:39.600 --> 13:41.519
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.919
Oh, my God. I'm a teenage paedo.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.519
Like an actual paedophile!

13:46.520 --> 13:48.519
Me! Fuck!

13:48.520 --> 13:51.679
I woke up this morning and I was
normal!

13:51.680 --> 13:53.479
Poppy!

13:53.480 --> 13:57.079
Shiz. That's my parents.
Oh, my God.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.559
You just get off your arse.

14:00.560 --> 14:04.559
All right, I will, then.

14:05.400 --> 14:06.999
Lovely!

14:07.000 --> 14:09.439
You know, when we met,
you loved the fact that I fought.

14:09.440 --> 14:12.639
If that was all that was wrong with
you then, Connell, things change.

14:12.640 --> 14:15.199
Let's not talk
about things changing, love.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.479
Unless you want to talk about your
tits. Oh, fuck off! And your arse.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.559
Go and do the garden like you...

14:19.560 --> 14:21.799
Don't fuck me around
the fucking Cotswolds!

14:21.800 --> 14:24.599
If only you knew where the Cotswolds
were, Connell, if fucking only!

14:24.600 --> 14:27.159
If only I could get at them, love!

14:27.160 --> 14:29.119
Stop it, Connell! All right!
Stop it!

14:29.120 --> 14:32.719
Don't talk to me like that!
That's right!

14:32.720 --> 14:36.719
No, no, don't pin any of this
"oh, he doesn't even touch me any
more" shite on me, all right?

15:00.280 --> 15:03.319
Boo!
Fucking...

15:03.320 --> 15:05.839
So. How did D-day
go with the green fairy?

15:05.840 --> 15:09.239
Pixie. Look, mate, I... I really need
to talk to you about...

15:09.240 --> 15:13.239
Oh, Frankster. Alo was just gushing
about his new squeeze.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.719
New squeeze?
There's no squeeze.

15:16.720 --> 15:20.719
Yeah, Al. About that. I, um...

15:21.200 --> 15:24.759
Hey, Hardbeck, do you mind if I chat
up your life partner for a hot
minute?

15:24.760 --> 15:28.759
Sure.

15:30.720 --> 15:34.719
Oh, what, alone? Oh, cool, yeah.
Mm.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.439
Yeah.

15:38.440 --> 15:41.199
Laters.

15:41.200 --> 15:45.159
I know about you and Mini.
Yeah, and?

15:45.160 --> 15:47.159
And?

15:48.840 --> 15:52.839
Look, Mini likes to think
she's a complicated girl, Alo,
but she's not.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.319
When she says no,
she really means yes.

15:57.320 --> 16:00.559
That sounds a bit wrong.
Focus, Alo.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.559
Mini needs you.
She doesn't even like me.

16:03.560 --> 16:07.559
Doesn't matter.
You have to get her back.

16:07.760 --> 16:11.279
Don't you get it?

16:11.280 --> 16:15.279
You two are like the only good thing
to happen this entire crappy year.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.159
So, stop fucking it, Alo.

16:19.160 --> 16:20.959
How am I fucking...

16:20.960 --> 16:24.959
You know what, Franks? I cannot
deal with this bullshit right now.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.119
I'm sorry but it's over.

16:43.120 --> 16:46.879
No, don't cry. I'm not dumping you.

16:46.880 --> 16:50.879
I just don't want to hear
or see you any more.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.559
It's over, bitch!

16:56.560 --> 16:59.199
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I'm so glad you came!

16:59.200 --> 17:01.999
Oh. Um... Poppy.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.118
I...

17:04.119 --> 17:06.959
We need to talk.
After you meet my mates.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.999
So, what are you, like, 30?
Yeah, close.

17:13.079 --> 17:14.959
Anyway, status update?

17:14.960 --> 17:18.959
Well, it's not Facebook official.
But it's totally official.
Right, babes?

17:19.960 --> 17:22.679
Yeah, yeah. Love you too, girlfriend.

17:22.680 --> 17:25.439
So, what, have you two
like done the nookie?

17:25.440 --> 17:27.559
Don't be dizzy, Megs.
I'm no Taylor Swift.

17:27.560 --> 17:31.159
We did it like a million times last
night. Doggy, pony, everything.
Right, babe?

17:31.160 --> 17:33.799
You should defs invite some
of your hot mates to come jam.

17:33.800 --> 17:37.799
The boy-girl ratio here is
practically lezbo. No offence, Pops.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.479
Yeah, they're not really into
electro-pop. Or prison.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.079
What?

17:44.360 --> 17:47.599
Tune!

17:47.600 --> 17:51.599
Ah. What's happening?

18:10.520 --> 18:12.159
Poppy! Poppy!
Hey!

18:12.160 --> 18:16.039
We need to talk.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.839
Hands to yourself, Chris Brown.

18:18.840 --> 18:21.319
You wanna do hot knives? Poppy.
We don't have to do hot knives.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.919
Cheska scammed some MD off her
sister. We could drop a few bombs
if you want.

18:23.920 --> 18:26.679
Poppy. I should never have come
here.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.999
I...

18:29.000 --> 18:32.999
I'm sorry but I can't be
your boyfriend
or whatever you want me to be.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.399
Look, it's not you, it's me.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.719
OK? No, actually it is kind of all
you.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.719
But, I mean, don't feel bad
because we can still be mates.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.679
I mean not, like, call or text
or hang-out kind of mates.

18:49.680 --> 18:52.999
But... I'm really sorry.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.279
You're gonna go back
to that mega-bitch Mini, aren't you?

18:55.280 --> 18:57.399
No! I don't know!

18:57.400 --> 18:58.599
Fine. Flip off!

18:58.600 --> 19:00.479
You make people think you're nice
but you're not nice.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.599
You're just a... a hypocrite!

19:02.600 --> 19:04.439
Get out!

19:04.440 --> 19:06.399
Wait! Stop!

19:06.400 --> 19:09.279
Please don't go!
You won't be happy with her!

19:09.280 --> 19:11.759
She doesn't love you!
Listen to me, OK, Poppy?

19:11.760 --> 19:14.879
I'm sorry, OK?
But I... I don't love you back.

19:14.880 --> 19:18.879
And it's... it's just not love
if someone doesn't love you back.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.239
Stop. Stop it. Stop it!

19:23.240 --> 19:26.079
I'm not your boyfriend!

19:26.080 --> 19:29.439
You're a child! It's sick!
I don't even like you!

19:29.440 --> 19:33.439
And no amount of head or head-fuckery
is going to change that!

19:36.520 --> 19:38.479
Poppy, look...
Back the fuck up, kiddy fiddler!

19:38.480 --> 19:40.519
Pervert!
Someone call the police!

19:40.520 --> 19:42.799
No, it's...
I'm going, all right? I'm going.

19:42.800 --> 19:46.159
What?!

20:18.640 --> 20:20.639
So, you gonna tell me, then, what
happened with, er...

20:20.640 --> 20:22.359
Poppy, champion of the world?

20:22.360 --> 20:26.359
No. Shut up, all right? I've been
thinking. Why don't we go away?

20:27.160 --> 20:28.479
What?

20:28.480 --> 20:31.319
Yeah, you know. We'll... we'll
hit up Amsterdam.

20:31.320 --> 20:32.839
Lost Boys it like we
always said we would.

20:32.840 --> 20:33.919
Is this about your exam?

20:33.920 --> 20:37.479
Because I told you you can't cram
an entire term the night before, Al.

20:37.480 --> 20:41.479
No. This is not about an exam.
I just wanna get away, that's all.

20:41.560 --> 20:45.479
And right now I want to go to
Amsterdam with my best fucking matey.

20:45.480 --> 20:48.519
Now come on. What do you say?

20:48.520 --> 20:50.679
I dunno, Al.
I'll think about it, yeah?

20:50.680 --> 20:54.039
Bullshit, Rich. Do not just say stuff
to make me feel better.

20:54.040 --> 20:58.039
I think it's tops.
Just... I mean well back-burn it.

20:58.560 --> 21:02.559
No. It's a yay or a nay,
or fuck off, Rich.

21:38.400 --> 21:42.399
McGuinness!

21:47.920 --> 21:49.119
Thanks.

21:49.120 --> 21:53.119
That's OK.

21:55.080 --> 21:59.039
Is this year 13 geography?

21:59.040 --> 22:03.039
Yes.

22:05.760 --> 22:09.759
Aloysius Creevey.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.919
Oi!

22:13.920 --> 22:15.639
Oh!

22:15.640 --> 22:18.359
What the fuck are you doing?

22:18.360 --> 22:19.959
You're nicked.

22:19.960 --> 22:23.959
Yeah, all right, mate!

22:24.080 --> 22:28.079
Come on, son. You won't need
A-levels where you're going.

22:41.320 --> 22:45.319
Look. Whatever you think I've done,
all right, you're wrong.

22:45.880 --> 22:48.999
I'm just waiting to hear you say it.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.999
Play silly buggers if you want.
We've got all day.

22:55.840 --> 22:59.839
Smithy, we've got squash at seven.

23:00.480 --> 23:04.359
We've got till six.
Minus an hour for lunch.

23:04.360 --> 23:07.519
So, you better start talking,
boyo, cos you're in trouble.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.039
Big trouble.

23:09.040 --> 23:12.759
You're looking
at at least three years' jail time.

23:12.760 --> 23:15.039
Plus a year on the sex offenders
register.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.599
Three years?

23:16.600 --> 23:20.599
We have a statement here given by
Poppy Champion earlier today.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.919
Mitch?

23:23.920 --> 23:27.359
"Aloysius Creevey
groomed me until I sexed him.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.439
"He said he liked 'em young."

23:29.440 --> 23:32.919
Nuh-uh, right? It's the other way
around. She's had more sex than me!

23:32.920 --> 23:36.919
"He told me I could play with his
puppy. But he didn't mean his pet."

23:37.040 --> 23:39.319
I meant Rags.

23:39.320 --> 23:42.399
My dog Rags, not...

23:42.400 --> 23:43.879
my penis.

23:43.880 --> 23:47.879
"He gave me alcohol and..."
And drugs.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.599
"He said it wouldn't hurt."

23:50.600 --> 23:52.039
You sick bastard.

23:52.040 --> 23:54.359
You sick... you sick bastard.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.759
Look, all right?
She is the sick one.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.959
She's lying!

23:58.960 --> 24:01.839
Oh, come on!

24:01.840 --> 24:04.399
Right. OK.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.919
All right.

24:06.920 --> 24:10.919
I had sex with her, but I didn't know
she was underage, OK?

24:12.160 --> 24:15.279
I didn't know.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.999
I swear I didn't know!

24:19.560 --> 24:20.679
You do not have to say anything,

24:20.680 --> 24:23.319
but it may harm your defence if you
do not mention, when questioned,

24:23.320 --> 24:26.279
something which
you later rely on in court.

24:26.280 --> 24:29.959
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

25:08.680 --> 25:12.679
Aloysius Creevey.
You've got a visitor.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.639
Hello, Aloysius.

25:18.640 --> 25:22.639
How are you, lad?

25:31.480 --> 25:33.239
We've cleared out your locker.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.839
Most of it we had to confiscate.

25:36.840 --> 25:40.319
Or incinerate.

25:40.320 --> 25:44.319
Here's the rest.

25:48.560 --> 25:52.559
I think you know
what I'm going to say.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.759
I'm sorry, Aloysius.

25:56.760 --> 25:59.919
But we are suspending you
from Roundview College,

25:59.920 --> 26:03.119
subject to further investigation.

26:03.120 --> 26:07.119
Doug, please.

26:07.200 --> 26:10.319
It's out of my hands, Aloysius.

26:10.320 --> 26:14.199
They're saying
you're a danger to children.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.279
Or in street parlance, a nonce.

26:16.280 --> 26:19.519
I am not a nonce, all right?

26:19.520 --> 26:23.519
I know that.
But technically you are.

26:23.560 --> 26:27.559
Sorry.

26:28.760 --> 26:31.519
But chin up.

26:31.520 --> 26:34.319
You can bounce back.
Get on that horse.

26:34.320 --> 26:37.359
And don't let the bastards
grind you down!

26:37.360 --> 26:40.479
Not you. I didn't mean you.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.519
Can you leave now, please?

26:42.520 --> 26:46.519
Yes. Yes.

26:50.560 --> 26:53.679
Remember, lad. Oggy, oggy, oggy!

26:53.680 --> 26:56.999
Yes?

27:00.040 --> 27:01.919
You just called me a bastard.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.679
Er... no.

27:03.680 --> 27:07.679
I... I didn't.

27:08.440 --> 27:12.439
Aloysius Creevey. You've
been released on bail pending trial.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.239
You should have told me.

27:35.240 --> 27:39.239
I thought I could handle it.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.559
You know everything's
gonna be fine, right?

27:45.560 --> 27:49.559
No, Richard. It's not fine. That is
the opposite of what its going to be.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.519
Everything is fucked.

27:51.520 --> 27:55.519
If it's fucked now, what's it gonna
be like next year or in five years?

27:55.840 --> 27:59.839
I cant hack this for the rest
of my life, Rich, all right?

28:02.600 --> 28:05.799
What shall I do?

28:05.800 --> 28:06.599
What are you doing?

28:06.600 --> 28:07.759
Just...

28:07.760 --> 28:09.439
I don't need that
kind of cheering up.

28:09.440 --> 28:13.119
Just ring Poppy and be like,
you know, what the fuck and shit.

28:13.120 --> 28:17.119
I don't think I'm allowed
to talk to her.

28:18.840 --> 28:22.839
What are you doing? Rich!
Rich, I think that's still illegal.

28:24.280 --> 28:27.119
Don't call her. Don't call her, Rich.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.399
Rich! Rich, don't. Don't fucking...

28:28.400 --> 28:29.599
It's ringing.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.559
Rich, stop. No, no! Rich, don't...

28:30.560 --> 28:31.679
It's ringing. There you go.

28:31.680 --> 28:34.839
Thank God! I got arrested
because of you! Sorry.

28:34.840 --> 28:38.199
OK. I am being charged with
a sexual assault of a minor.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.799
Do you have any idea
how serious that is?

28:40.800 --> 28:44.599
I know and I'm sorry. I was just
monumentally pissed at you.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.999
I could go to jail.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.839
If you tell them I made it
all up, they'll drop the charges.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.999
Poppy, who are you talking to?

28:51.000 --> 28:53.639
Dad! I... No-one. Dad!

28:53.640 --> 28:57.639
Hey, now you listen here, you sick
paedo fuck. You're going to jail.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.279
Hi, Mr Champion. If you'd kindly
let me finish speaking with Po...

29:00.280 --> 29:04.039
Now, I'm a God-fearing man,
but I swear to baby Christ

29:04.040 --> 29:07.559
if that limp dick jumps out of your
pants again, I will bite it off!

29:07.560 --> 29:10.399
Mr Champion,
I apologise. If there's anything...

29:10.400 --> 29:12.919
I will bite off that cocky cock
of yours.

29:12.920 --> 29:15.399
Do you hear me?
Yes, I can hear you.

29:15.400 --> 29:19.199
I will rape you in your prickless
hole with your own dirty dick.

29:19.200 --> 29:23.199
I will rape you so fucking hard
you'll wish you died as a child!

29:24.640 --> 29:25.959
OK.

29:25.960 --> 29:28.599
'Fuck you!'

29:28.600 --> 29:31.359
What did she say?

29:31.360 --> 29:34.159
No. No, that was her dad, right?

29:34.160 --> 29:38.159
He wants to bite my dick off and rape
me with it. So, you know, no biggie.

29:38.840 --> 29:41.279
So, that... it didn't go well, then?

29:41.280 --> 29:45.279
Come on, mate. Let's just leave.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.039
Oh, fucking great.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.919
Where you going?
You can't just run away from this.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.559
I can, Rich, yeah?

29:50.560 --> 29:52.279
People say that they can't
run away from their problems.

29:52.280 --> 29:56.279
Well, yeah, they just
weren't running fast enough.

29:58.360 --> 30:00.559
Alo! Alo!

30:00.560 --> 30:04.279
Al!

30:19.640 --> 30:23.639
I don't know what kids' bus
you're getting, mate.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.279
Fuck's sake!

31:35.880 --> 31:38.639
'Hi, this is Mini. Can't talk right
now. Leave a message.'

32:22.720 --> 32:24.079
Oi! Who's down here then?

32:24.080 --> 32:25.119
Ow!

32:25.120 --> 32:29.119
Go back up, you little bastard.

32:29.280 --> 32:32.039
Tyler, get away from that strange
man! You nonce!

32:32.040 --> 32:33.839
No, it's not what it looks like.

32:33.840 --> 32:34.879
Come on, girls.

32:34.880 --> 32:38.879
I've haven't even been to court yet!

32:43.000 --> 32:46.999
Oh, shit.

32:47.520 --> 32:50.479
Morning, boy.

32:50.480 --> 32:53.719
All right, Dewi? How did you find me?

32:53.720 --> 32:57.719
When you weren't in the barn.
Thought you'd be here.

33:01.480 --> 33:05.039
Hear you messed up.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.279
Yeah, I know.

33:06.280 --> 33:08.919
Mmm.

33:08.920 --> 33:12.919
Well, I brought this for you.

33:20.680 --> 33:22.999
It's from your ma.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.999
She's worried about you.

33:29.480 --> 33:31.719
I'm running away, Dew.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.559
Not a fan, then?

33:40.560 --> 33:42.999
Hmm.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.999
The thing about Peter Pan is,
boy, he's a coward.

33:49.320 --> 33:53.319
He had the chance of a lifetime
and he bottled it.

33:54.200 --> 33:58.199
Just fucked off back to Neverland.

33:58.240 --> 34:02.239
All alone forever,
he was, by his own hand.

34:04.520 --> 34:07.759
Poor old Wendy,

34:07.760 --> 34:11.319
she had to grow old without him.

34:11.320 --> 34:15.319
Fucking tragedy, if you ask me.

34:16.120 --> 34:19.319
Well, I suppose...

34:19.320 --> 34:21.518
you're old enough

34:21.520 --> 34:25.518
and, well, you're ugly enough
to make your own decisions.

34:26.080 --> 34:29.998
Or make your own mistakes.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.879
That's all I have.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.799
It's up to you now, son.

34:33.800 --> 34:37.799
Stay or run.

34:37.920 --> 34:41.159
Just look after yourself, eh, boy?

35:14.120 --> 35:16.799
McGuinness! McGuinness!

35:16.800 --> 35:18.679
Mini!

35:40.760 --> 35:44.759
For fuck's sake, farm boy!
What are you playing at?

35:47.120 --> 35:50.319
OK. OK, OK.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.079
With a little hindsight,

35:52.080 --> 35:56.079
the whole breaking and entering
does feel a bit excessive.

35:56.480 --> 36:00.479
But, to be fair, I did knock
and you didn't answer,

36:01.240 --> 36:03.519
which is kind of rude
considering you're actually home.

36:03.520 --> 36:06.599
Maybe because I didn't want
to speak to a child molester!

36:06.600 --> 36:07.639
It was an accident.

36:07.640 --> 36:10.959
What? What? You slipped,
fell and molested a pre-teen girl?

36:10.960 --> 36:11.999
Don't say that.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.039
I mean, you know, congratulations.

36:13.040 --> 36:16.159
You finally found a girl
with the same mental age as you.

36:16.160 --> 36:19.439
But, seriously, Alo,
what is wrong with you?

36:19.440 --> 36:20.999
You're what's wrong with me!

36:23.920 --> 36:27.359
I'm not just some lame Michael Cera.
You can't treat me like a bitch

36:27.360 --> 36:30.239
and expect me not to
fall in love with you.

36:30.240 --> 36:33.519
It's not fair, Mini.

36:33.520 --> 36:34.759
Who said I was in love with you?

36:34.760 --> 36:36.919
Don't... don't do that, OK?

36:36.920 --> 36:40.919
Don't revert back to that
Mean Girls McGuinness bullshit, OK?

36:41.480 --> 36:43.759
I hate that girl.

36:43.760 --> 36:47.239
I want you.

36:47.240 --> 36:50.119
I know you, Mini.
I know you're afraid.

36:50.120 --> 36:54.119
You're terrified of being alone,
but guess what. I'm not your dad.

36:55.800 --> 36:56.839
It's not that easy.

36:56.840 --> 36:59.119
How? How is it not that easy?

36:59.120 --> 37:03.119
I don't see what can be easier
than just you and me.

37:06.960 --> 37:10.959
What are you so afraid of?

37:12.720 --> 37:15.159
What... what is it?

37:15.160 --> 37:17.039
I want you to go, Alo.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.719
No.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.639
Leave now.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.679
Get out! Get out of my room!
Get out!

37:24.680 --> 37:26.479
Get out of my room!

37:26.480 --> 37:30.479
OK. OK, OK. I'll go.

37:40.720 --> 37:44.559
I love you and
I know you love me, too.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.119
And when you're ready to admit that,
you come and find me.

37:47.120 --> 37:50.919
Cos I'll be fucking waiting.

37:50.920 --> 37:54.919
However long it takes.

38:15.640 --> 38:16.823
You have to tell him.

38:42.380 --> 38:46.379
Alo! You came.

38:46.440 --> 38:48.599
Let's just get this done, yeah?

38:48.600 --> 38:52.599
OK. They're in here.

38:55.800 --> 38:59.799
Mum. Dad. This is Alo.

39:02.600 --> 39:06.039
He's here to talk about the charges.

39:06.040 --> 39:10.039
Hello.

39:11.400 --> 39:12.759
You'd better sit down.

39:12.760 --> 39:14.719
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't you dare

39:14.720 --> 39:16.799
sit at my table.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.239
It's my mother's table.

39:18.240 --> 39:19.879
Well, it's my house.

39:19.880 --> 39:22.159
So he'll stand.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.959
So, anyway...

39:23.960 --> 39:27.959
Basically, you know
what I told you and the police?

39:33.000 --> 39:36.999
Well, I made it up.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.759
This is your fault.

39:41.760 --> 39:43.839
She needs boundaries!

39:43.840 --> 39:46.759
You... you just let her gallivant...

39:46.760 --> 39:47.719
I do not!

39:47.720 --> 39:49.519
You're as soft as shite.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.919
You'd tie her up by the roadside.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.159
That dog was a hell beast.
He's better off.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.239
What, dead?

39:55.240 --> 39:56.279
I did not kill him.

39:56.280 --> 40:00.159
Who are you trying to convince?
You had it in for that dog
right from the start!

40:00.160 --> 40:03.839
Instead of using that knife
to butcher the overcooked lamb,

40:03.840 --> 40:06.399
why don't you just put me
out of my misery

40:06.400 --> 40:08.119
and slit my bloody wrists?

40:08.120 --> 40:09.319
Why don't you...?

40:09.320 --> 40:13.319
Shut the fuck up!

40:14.200 --> 40:16.039
This is bullshit.

40:16.040 --> 40:20.039
Poppy wanted me to come here
and convince you
that what she was saying wasn't true.

40:22.840 --> 40:26.119
But I can't do that.

40:26.120 --> 40:29.679
Cos it is.

40:29.680 --> 40:33.359
But you should know
that it was an accident.

40:33.360 --> 40:37.359
If I'd ever known her age,
I would never have...

40:37.720 --> 40:41.719
You can have me arrested.
You can beat the shit out of me.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.359
But I guarantee...

40:44.360 --> 40:48.319
it's not gonna make you feel
any better.

40:50.400 --> 40:54.399
Aah! Whoa! Aah!

40:54.400 --> 40:58.399
You know what? I do feel better!
I'll see you in court, scumbag!

41:37.320 --> 41:40.479
# We're casting off #

41:40.480 --> 41:43.479
# Setting sail #

41:43.480 --> 41:45.959
# Three sheets to the wind, lads... #

41:45.960 --> 41:47.319
Aye aye, Captain!

41:47.320 --> 41:49.919
So you're living
in a playground now.

41:49.920 --> 41:52.759
Smart move, farm boy.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.359
You look like shit.

41:55.360 --> 41:58.959
Yeah, well, you should see
the other guy.

41:58.960 --> 42:02.959
He's totally fine.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.639
Been looking for you everywhere.

42:10.640 --> 42:12.639
Why?

42:12.640 --> 42:14.759
Just trying to make convo.

42:18.840 --> 42:20.519
Come on, useless.

42:29.240 --> 42:31.279
Let's get you home.

42:31.280 --> 42:33.999
Alo. Yeah?

42:34.000 --> 42:35.359
Hand off my arse.

42:35.360 --> 42:38.799
Don't be so fussy.

42:42.400 --> 42:45.919
I've really fucked it, haven't I?

42:45.920 --> 42:49.919
Yep.

42:50.120 --> 42:54.119
To be fair, um...
it is quite an achievement

42:54.640 --> 42:58.639
to, er... screw up so epically.

42:59.520 --> 43:03.519
Cheers.

43:09.280 --> 43:11.039
What?

43:11.040 --> 43:15.039
Nothing. Nothing.

43:18.200 --> 43:21.359
You were gonna say
I fucked up with you as well?

43:21.360 --> 43:25.199
I fuck up everything. It's true.

43:25.200 --> 43:27.839
I wasn't sure what I wanted.

43:27.840 --> 43:31.839
Yeah, well, you were right
not to be sure.

43:32.240 --> 43:36.239
I'm just a fucking quarter bottle
of disappointment, me, ain't I?

43:39.720 --> 43:43.719
If I had a... a problem,
like a really big problem and, er...

43:44.800 --> 43:48.799
Well, would... would you help me?
Would you, like, stand by me?

43:50.400 --> 43:54.399
Would you help me?

43:55.520 --> 43:59.519
What?

44:01.600 --> 44:05.599
What is it?

44:10.880 --> 44:14.879
Oh.

44:15.040 --> 44:16.159
Hello?

44:16.160 --> 44:18.239
'Alo? It's me.'

44:18.240 --> 44:21.839
I'm not supposed to be
talking to you, am I?

44:21.840 --> 44:23.959
'I was just ringing to tell you

44:23.960 --> 44:26.799
'that you kind of made my mum
leave my dad.'

44:26.800 --> 44:29.639
Oh, for fuck's sake.

44:29.640 --> 44:33.359
'It's fine. He's a bit of a prick.
Everyone knows it.

44:33.360 --> 44:37.159
'But Mum made him drop the charges.
And you're lovely.

44:37.160 --> 44:41.159
'Whoever gets to be your girlfriend
is lucky, cos you're lovely.

44:41.240 --> 44:45.239
'Plus, you've got
a ginormous willy.

44:45.800 --> 44:48.279
'Bye, Alo.'

44:58.840 --> 45:01.199
Mini?

45:01.200 --> 45:03.279
Mini?

45:13.560 --> 45:15.519
What?

45:45.560 --> 45:48.399
Alex is never
with one guy for long.

45:48.400 --> 45:51.879
So whatever you think might be
about to happen, it's not real.

45:51.880 --> 45:54.719
He's right. You are edgy.

45:54.720 --> 45:56.759
What about little bomber boy?

45:56.760 --> 45:57.679
He's away.

45:57.680 --> 46:00.959
Oh, so now you're back in
my life? Is that how it works?

46:02.280 --> 46:03.919
Nobody calls you out.

46:03.920 --> 46:05.199
About what?

46:05.200 --> 46:08.039
That Grace wouldn't be dead

46:08.040 --> 46:12.039
if you hadn't been fucking over Matty
and every other boy who came by.

46:12.480 --> 46:15.639
Don't die. Ever.

46:15.640 --> 46:18.039
OK.

46:18.040 --> 46:19.599
Hey! Liv!

46:26.360 --> 46:28.039
Something's wrong.

46:28.064 --> 47:09.920
