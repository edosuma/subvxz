WEBVTT

00:01.332 --> 00:02.733
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.733 --> 00:04.135
MR. GRAYSON HERE MADE SOME KIND
OF DEAL WITH THE COURT.

00:04.135 --> 00:07.038
HELPING YOU WOULD BE
BENEFICIAL TOWARDS RESTORING

00:07.038 --> 00:08.509
HIS PUBLIC PROFILE.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.541
DANIEL'S ADDING A NEW FEATHER
IN THE COMPANY CAP.

00:10.541 --> 00:12.313
STONEHAVEN UNITED.

00:12.313 --> 00:15.246
NOLAN ROSS IS HIDING
THE CARRION PROGRAM.
 We're counting on you.

00:15.246 --> 00:17.288
HELEN CROWLEY
MADE CONTACT WITH ME,

00:17.288 --> 00:20.151
TOLD ME THAT
MY SISTER'S STILL ALIVE.
 AND WE NEED TO DRAW HER OUT.

00:20.151 --> 00:23.354
(gasps)
 (gunfire)

00:23.354 --> 00:25.526
WHO WERE THOSE GUYS?
 I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS.

00:27.558 --> 00:30.061
BRAVA.
 NOW LET'S SEE
IF SHE BUYS IT.

00:31.802 --> 00:35.766
(Emily) EVERY HUMAN IS BORN
OF COLLUSION.

00:39.810 --> 00:44.145
WE COME INTO THIS WORLD
THE RESULT OF A COVENANT.

00:49.820 --> 00:52.723
SOMETIMES MADE OF LOVE...

00:58.129 --> 01:02.193
SOMETIMES OF CIRCUMSTANCE...

01:14.105 --> 01:14.805
(seagulls crying)

01:14.805 --> 01:18.179
BUT ALMOST ALWAYS
MADE IN SECRET.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.362
(newspaper rustles)

01:31.362 --> 01:33.093
I HAVE TO ASSUME

01:33.093 --> 01:34.465
THAT YOU'RE READING
THAT RAG AT THAT DECIBEL

01:34.465 --> 01:35.796
FOR MY BENEFIT.

01:35.796 --> 01:38.769
WHAT IN THIS HOUSE
ISN'T FOR YOUR BENEFIT, DEAR?

01:38.769 --> 01:40.401
THOUGH I DID CATCH WIND
OF SOME NEWS

01:40.401 --> 01:42.403
THAT I'M SURE
WILL INTEREST YOU.

01:42.403 --> 01:45.536
JASON PROSSER IS VYING
FOR STONEHAVEN UNITED.

01:45.536 --> 01:46.807
NOW THAT'S A LEAD
FROM THE INITIATIVE

01:46.807 --> 01:49.580
YOU WERE ONCE
IN SOLE POSSESSION OF.
 (newspaper thuds)

01:49.580 --> 01:51.111
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
IMPLYING, CONRAD?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.683
THAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO SUBVERT THE DEAL

01:52.683 --> 01:54.345
TO PROVE DANIEL'S
INCOMPETENCY TO HELEN.

01:54.345 --> 01:56.187
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I APPROVE OF THE PLAN.

01:56.187 --> 01:58.719
JUST NOT
WITH YOUR VISIBILITY.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.451
I'VE HAD
MY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR

02:00.451 --> 02:02.122
ASSEMBLE A MONTAUK DOSSIER.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.356
AS I GO FORWARD WITH MY PLANS
TO CLEAN UP THE DOCKS,

02:05.356 --> 02:07.598
I EXPECT YOU BY MY SIDE

02:07.598 --> 02:09.229
AS THE WIFE
YOU'VE RECOMMITTED TO BE.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.202
SO YOU'RE STILL USING
AMANDA CLARKE'S HARDSHIPS

02:11.202 --> 02:12.533
TO FEED YOUR DELUSIONS

02:12.533 --> 02:15.366
OF ONE DAY OCCUPYING
THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION?

02:15.366 --> 02:16.537
MORNING, ALL.

02:16.537 --> 02:19.370
DARLING, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

02:19.370 --> 02:20.811
THANKS, DADDY.

02:20.811 --> 02:22.543
JUST DON'T SPEND IT ALL
IN TEN PLACES.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.545
SWEETHEART. OH.
(kisses)

02:24.545 --> 02:27.348
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I HAVE
A 24 AND 18-YEAR-OLD?

02:27.348 --> 02:28.649
WHERE DOES TIME GO?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.781
AND WHERE IS DANIEL?

02:30.781 --> 02:32.323
OH, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
HE'S ALREADY IN THE OFFICE.

02:32.323 --> 02:33.654
SO DRIVEN THAT APPARENTLY

02:33.654 --> 02:35.926
HE FORGOT
HIS LITTLE SISTER'S BIG DAY.

02:35.926 --> 02:37.758
GOOD MORNING.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.190
OH, GOOD MORNING.

02:39.190 --> 02:41.161
CHARLOTTE, WOULD YOU
EXCUSE US FOR A MINUTE?

02:41.161 --> 02:43.364
IT SEEMS THAT THE CAT
HAS DRAGGED ITSELF BACK IN.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.196
THERE'S THE REPORT
YOU REQUESTED.

02:45.196 --> 02:46.437
THANK YOU.

02:46.437 --> 02:48.699
SO THIS IS THE NEW
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR?

02:48.699 --> 02:49.840
DON'T YOU KNOW
THAT POLITICIANS

02:49.840 --> 02:52.203
TEND TO KEEP THEIR CONCUBINES
IN THE CLOSET?

02:52.203 --> 02:54.305
SPOKEN LIKE A WOMAN THAT
NO ONE IS SLEEPING WITH.

02:54.305 --> 02:56.807
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO HEAR
THAT MS. DAVENPORT AND I

02:56.807 --> 02:58.178
HAVE PUT OUR PAST BEHIND US,

02:58.178 --> 02:59.880
AND WE ARE NOW
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.682
WELL, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
WHAT KIND OF HORRIFYING FOOTAGE

03:01.682 --> 03:03.183
THAT WILL YIELD.

03:07.918 --> 03:11.922
YOU LOOK LIKE
THE LONELIEST MAN IN THE WORLD.

03:11.922 --> 03:14.194
FIRST I'M BANNED
FROM GRAYSON GLOBAL,

03:14.194 --> 03:15.966
NOW YOUR HOUSE.

03:15.966 --> 03:17.298
HOW LONG TILL OUR SCHEMING

03:17.298 --> 03:18.969
GETS ME BANNED
FROM THE HAMPTONS ENTIRELY?

03:18.969 --> 03:20.271
THAT'S WHY I CALLED.

03:20.271 --> 03:22.403
I NEEDED AN HONEST MOMENT.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.204
I MISS YOU.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.342
ME, TOO.

03:31.342 --> 03:32.843
AS MOST OF THE TIME
I'M WITH YOU,

03:32.843 --> 03:34.585
I'M RESIGNED TO PLAYING
THE JEALOUS EX.

03:34.585 --> 03:36.587
WELL, YOU PLAYED IT PERFECTLY
LAST NIGHT.

03:36.587 --> 03:38.549
THANK YOU.
 (chuckles)

03:38.549 --> 03:40.921
HOW ARE YOU DOING
WITH IT?

03:40.921 --> 03:43.924
AS WELL AS A WOMAN
LEADING ON HER EX-FIANCE

03:43.924 --> 03:46.397
CAN POSSIBLY FEEL
ABOUT HERSELF.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.930
HE'S TAKING ME TO LUNCH,
TO A NEW OYSTER BAR.

03:49.930 --> 03:53.304
OYSTERS. SUBTLE.

03:53.304 --> 03:57.708
HEY, WELL, AT LEAST OUR...
MISSION IS ON TRACK.

03:59.970 --> 04:02.513
AIDEN, I KNOW HOW HARD
IT MUST BE,

04:02.513 --> 04:04.745
WAITING FOR A LEAD
ON YOUR SISTER,

04:04.745 --> 04:06.317
BUT UNTIL THEY GIVE YOU
PROOF THAT SHE'S ALIVE--

04:06.317 --> 04:07.648
I CAN SUBSIST ON HOPE,

04:07.648 --> 04:09.880
WHICH IS MORE THAN I'VE HAD
FOR THE PAST DECADE.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.283
(waves crashing)

04:12.283 --> 04:13.954
SO WHAT'S YOUR NEXT MOVE?

04:13.954 --> 04:16.427
UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT MINE.
IT'S HELEN'S.

04:16.427 --> 04:18.529
SHE'S HOLDING ALL THE CARDS.

04:18.529 --> 04:20.331
WHATEVER HAPPENS,

04:20.331 --> 04:22.463
WE'RE GONNA FIGURE IT OUT,
OKAY?

04:22.463 --> 04:24.365
I PROMISE.

04:28.899 --> 04:30.941
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.606
YOU HAD THE SELLER
STAGE THIS PLACE

04:35.606 --> 04:38.409
WITH ALL MY FAVORITE DECOR,
DIDN'T YOU?

04:38.409 --> 04:42.683
ANYTHING TO END
YOUR NEVER-ENDING HOUSE HUNT.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.014
YOU'VE HATED
ALL THE OTHER PLACES

04:44.014 --> 04:45.816
FOR THE MOST
NITPICKY REASONS.

04:45.816 --> 04:48.489
WELL, WE'VE ONLY LOOKED AT...
12.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.290
AT AN AVERAGE OF
20,000-SQUARE-FOOT PER,

04:50.290 --> 04:51.622
WHICH ADDS UP TO--

04:51.622 --> 04:53.063
A MARATHON.

04:53.063 --> 04:54.595
I SEE YOUR POINT,

04:54.595 --> 04:57.428
AND I THINK...

04:57.428 --> 05:00.070
I DO LOVE THIS HOUSE.

05:00.070 --> 05:02.903
GREAT!
I'LL CALL THE AGENT.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.406
(singsongy) AND THIS
CAN BE YOURS TOMORROW.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.977
HMM.

05:06.977 --> 05:09.580
(normal voice) OKAY.
WHAT'S WRONG NOW?

05:09.580 --> 05:14.014
WELL, THE KEY--
IT'S A LITTLE... PEDESTRIAN.
 (jangles)

05:14.014 --> 05:15.586
(sighs)

05:15.586 --> 05:18.589
OKAY, 'KAY, 'KAY.
WELL, NOTHING'S... PERFECT.

05:18.589 --> 05:21.992
EXCEPT... MAYBE YOU.

05:28.629 --> 05:31.362
(engine revving)
 (Emily) I THOUGHT
WE WERE GOING FOR LUNCH.

05:31.362 --> 05:32.863
(Daniel) WE ARE.

05:34.365 --> 05:36.637
YOU LOVE KUMAMOTOS, RIGHT?

05:36.637 --> 05:38.509
WELL, THEY'RE ONLY FRESH
ON THE WEST COAST,

05:38.509 --> 05:41.742
AND SINCE THE OYSTERS
CAN'T COME TO US...

05:41.742 --> 05:43.414
NO, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY--

05:43.414 --> 05:44.915
WE GOTTA TAKE THIS SLOW.

05:44.915 --> 05:47.578
BUT STONEHAVEN WANTS FACE TIME
WITH EVERYONE IN THE RUNNING,

05:47.578 --> 05:49.950
AND I'M AT MY BEST
WITH YOU BY MY SIDE.

05:51.722 --> 05:53.053
DANIEL... (sighs)

05:53.053 --> 05:54.385
I CAN'T JUST PICK UP
AND LEAVE.

05:54.385 --> 05:56.587
I DIDN'T EVEN BRING
ANYTHING WITH ME.

05:56.587 --> 05:57.758
DON'T WORRY.
I PACKED YOU A BAG.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.560
I EVEN BOUGHT YOU
A COUPLE OF NEW OUTFITS

05:59.560 --> 06:00.791
FOR LOS ANGELES.

06:00.791 --> 06:02.893
IT'S ALL ON BOARD.

06:02.893 --> 06:05.035
LISTEN, EM...

06:05.035 --> 06:07.798
YOU HELPED ME LAND
TAKEDA INDUSTRIES AND NolCorp.

06:07.798 --> 06:09.600
BUT THIS IS
MY FIRST REAL PLAY AS C.E.O.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.902
HELP ME MAKE IT A TRIFECTA.

06:11.902 --> 06:13.544
PLEASE.

06:17.608 --> 06:18.809
GREAT. (kisses)

06:18.809 --> 06:21.512
NOW I PROMISE,
THIS IS A BUSINESS TRIP.

06:21.512 --> 06:23.884
ALL RIGHT? WE CAN TAKE IT
AS SLOW AS YOU LIKE.

06:23.884 --> 06:24.915
UNLESS...

06:24.915 --> 06:28.989
EASY, TIGER.
LET'S GET STONEHAVEN FIRST.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.161
THEN WE'LL DECIDE
HOW TO CELEBRATE.

06:32.423 --> 06:34.725
(tires screeching in distance)

06:34.725 --> 06:36.427
(alarm chirps)

06:38.999 --> 06:41.001
(window whirs)

06:41.001 --> 06:42.933
YOU COULD'VE JUST CALLED.

06:42.933 --> 06:45.736
THAT'S SO IMPERSONAL
AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

06:45.736 --> 06:47.037
AND BESIDES,
IT'S IN MY BEST INTEREST

06:47.037 --> 06:48.939
TO KEEP THE BALL
IN MY COURT.

06:48.939 --> 06:50.881
I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS
YOU WERE BEHIND

06:50.881 --> 06:52.813
THAT LITTLE STUNT
AT THE WINE AUCTION.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.715
OH, YOU FLATTER ME.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.147
IF YOU RECALL,
THEY GASSED US BOTH.

06:57.147 --> 06:58.619
A PERFECT COVER
FOR YOUR PARTNER

06:58.619 --> 07:01.151
TO RUN THE INTERROGATION.

07:01.151 --> 07:03.724
YOU AND VICTORIA GRAYSON
HAVE MUCH TO GAIN

07:03.724 --> 07:05.055
BY WORKING TOGETHER--

07:05.055 --> 07:08.198
YOU TO SAVE YOUR SISTER,
SHE TO SAVE HER SON.

07:08.198 --> 07:10.200
I ASSURE YOU, I HAD NO PART
TO PLAY IN OUR ABDUCTION,

07:10.200 --> 07:12.202
NOR WOULD I EVER COLLUDE
WITH THAT WOMAN.

07:12.202 --> 07:13.764
I WORK ALONE.

07:13.764 --> 07:15.065
AND UNTIL I SEE PROOF
OF MY SISTER'S WELL-BEING,

07:15.065 --> 07:17.437
THAT'S HOW
IT'S GOING TO STAY.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.010
(beep)

07:20.010 --> 07:21.572
(man) WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN,
DARLIN'?

07:21.572 --> 07:23.644
COLLEEN.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.216
THAT RIGHT? YOU GOT
A FAMILY SOMEWHERE?

07:26.216 --> 07:28.148
I HAVE A BROTHER.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.120
(beep)

07:30.120 --> 07:32.152
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

07:32.152 --> 07:34.685
KILL VICTORIA GRAYSON.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.128
YOU HAVE 24 HOURS.

07:38.128 --> 07:40.931
(whirring)

07:40.931 --> 07:42.963
(tires screech)

07:59.810 --> 08:01.251
(Conrad) NOT ONLY DO I
APPRECIATE YOUR PLIGHT,

08:01.251 --> 08:02.953
IT MAY SURPRISE YOU,
MR. PORTER,

08:02.953 --> 08:05.886
BUT WE HAVE
A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT IN COMMON.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.758
WE'RE BOTH ENTREPRENEURS,

08:07.758 --> 08:10.020
BOTH IN
COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS.

08:10.020 --> 08:12.793
WE TOOK OVER
OUR FATHER'S BUSINESSES,

08:12.793 --> 08:14.965
AND WE INHERITED THEIR SINS.

08:14.965 --> 08:17.828
CLEARING THE DRUG CHARGE WON'T
BE A PROBLEM FOR MY LAWYERS,

08:17.828 --> 08:19.199
BUT (sighs) MURDER...

08:19.199 --> 08:20.571
JACK DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

08:20.571 --> 08:21.732
WE KNOW, BUT WE ALSO KNOW

08:21.732 --> 08:22.973
THAT THE GUN USED
TO KILL JOE RYAN

08:22.973 --> 08:24.905
WAS REGISTERED TO HIS FATHER.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.076
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHY
WE WERE HERE,

08:26.076 --> 08:27.237
SO YOU COULD HELP US
WITH THAT.

08:27.237 --> 08:29.740
OR IS IT
THE OTHER WAY AROUND?

08:29.740 --> 08:32.511
ARE WE JUST THE POSTER CHILDREN
FOR YOUR NEW PUBLIC IMAGE?

08:32.511 --> 08:34.544
OH, YOU MEAN DO I HAVE
A SELFISH MOTIVATION FOR THIS?

08:34.544 --> 08:36.046
YOU BET.

08:36.046 --> 08:38.989
SEE, MY DAUGHTER CHOOSES
TO SPEND HER LEISURE TIME

08:38.989 --> 08:40.520
IN YOUR
QUESTIONABLE ESTABLISHMENT,

08:40.520 --> 08:41.952
PUTTING HERSELF
IN HARM'S WAY.

08:41.952 --> 08:44.224
IT'S A CONCERN I'M SURE
YOU SHARE FOR YOUR SON CARL,

08:44.224 --> 08:46.557
A CHILD PROUDLY NAMED
AFTER THE MAN

08:46.557 --> 08:49.830
WHOSE LEGACY YOU'RE WILLING
TO GO TO JAIL TO UPHOLD.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.863
(sighs)

08:52.863 --> 08:55.265
THE SHOOTER'S NAME
IS MATT DUNCAN.

08:55.265 --> 08:56.937
THE RYAN BROTHERS PUT HIM
IN THE HOSPITAL

08:56.937 --> 08:58.308
TRYING TO GET HIM TO TALK,
BUT HE WOULDN'T BREAK.

08:58.308 --> 08:59.670
I'LL GET THE AUTHORITIES
ON THE LINE.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.071
NO, LOOK,
WITHOUT MATT DUNCAN,

09:01.071 --> 09:02.873
MY DAD WOULD'VE LOST
THE STOWAWAY SIX YEARS AGO.

09:02.873 --> 09:06.076
HE PROTECTED US THEN.
I'M STANDING BY HIM NOW.

09:06.076 --> 09:08.078
(Conrad) OH, I CAN SEE
WE'RE BOTH STUBBORN, TOO.

09:08.078 --> 09:11.722
BUT UNLIKE YOU, MR. PORTER,
I VALUE SELF-PRESERVATION

09:11.722 --> 09:13.053
AND THE LIVING.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.285
I'M AFRAID
I'M UNABLE TO HELP YOU

09:15.285 --> 09:16.987
IF YOU'RE UNWILLING
TO HELP YOURSELF.

09:16.987 --> 09:18.989
FEEL FREE
TO SHOW YOURSELVES OUT.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.894
I KNEW THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

09:23.894 --> 09:27.197
THE ONLY MISTAKE
BEING MADE HERE IS YOURS.

09:27.197 --> 09:28.699
(sighs)

09:28.699 --> 09:32.142
FATHER'S FRIEND OR NOT,
MATT DUNCAN IS A MURDERER.

09:32.142 --> 09:34.174
IF YOU DON'T CALL HIM OUT,
CARL LOSES HIS DAD,

09:34.174 --> 09:37.277
AND I LOSE MY HUSBAND...

09:37.277 --> 09:39.079
(crying) ASSUMING
I EVEN GET TO CALL YOU THAT

09:39.079 --> 09:41.181
BEFORE THEY LOCK YOU UP.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.914
(sobs)

09:45.355 --> 09:47.087
(woman)
AFTER THE NORTHRIDGE QUAKE,

09:47.087 --> 09:48.919
MY FATHER WAS INSPIRED
TO USE THE PROFITS

09:48.919 --> 09:50.220
FROM OUR MILITARY CONTRACTS

09:50.220 --> 09:53.724
TO CREATE A PRIVATIZED
DISASTER-RELIEF FIRM.

09:53.724 --> 09:55.966
STONEHAVEN AND ITS EMPLOYEES
MEANT EVERYTHING TO MY FATHER.

09:55.966 --> 09:59.229
AND I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN HANDING IT OVER TO SOMEONE

09:59.229 --> 10:01.832
WITH PLANS TO BREAK IT UP
AND SELL IT FOR PARTS.

10:01.832 --> 10:04.074
BELIEVE ME, THAT'S NOT
MY INTENTION AT ALL.

10:04.074 --> 10:06.076
FORGIVE ME, BUT YOUR COMPANY'S
RATHER DUBIOUS REPUTATION

10:06.076 --> 10:08.178
DOESN'T OFFER MUCH COMFORT.

10:08.178 --> 10:10.280
WELL, I THINK
WE CAN ALL AGREE

10:10.280 --> 10:13.844
THAT GRAYSON GLOBAL NEEDS ITS
OWN KIND OF DISASTER RELIEF.

10:13.844 --> 10:16.917
WHY DON'T YOU MENTION WHAT WE
WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.348
RIGHT.

10:18.348 --> 10:19.920
MY GOAL IS
TO RE-BRAND OUR IMAGE

10:19.920 --> 10:21.952
SO THAT THE "GLOBAL" REFERS
TO WORLD VIEW,

10:21.952 --> 10:23.794
NOT WORLD DOMINATION.
(chuckles)

10:26.056 --> 10:27.227
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CANDOR.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.929
AND I CAN TELL YOU

10:28.929 --> 10:30.931
THAT YOUR BID IS ON TOP
OF A VERY SHORT LIST

10:30.931 --> 10:32.402
OF COMPETING OFFERS.

10:32.402 --> 10:34.204
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY,

10:34.204 --> 10:35.766
MS. CARLISLE.
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.

10:35.766 --> 10:36.937
LOVELY TO MEET YOU.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.038
YOU, TOO.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.670
YOU SEE?

10:39.670 --> 10:41.842
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU,
I MAY HAVE LOST HER JUST NOW.

10:41.842 --> 10:42.973
THANKS FOR THE ASSIST.

10:42.973 --> 10:44.675
WELL, WE HAVEN'T WON YET.

10:44.675 --> 10:46.747
BUT IT'S LOOKING UP.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.078
SHOULD WE HEAD
TO THE HOTEL?

10:53.153 --> 10:54.685
(objects rattle)

10:54.685 --> 10:58.658
(cell phone vibrating)

10:58.658 --> 10:59.890
(beep)
 YES.

10:59.890 --> 11:01.061
THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE

11:01.061 --> 11:02.963
ARE BEGINNING TO COME TOGETHER,
MS. LAHARI.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.194
All but yours.

11:04.194 --> 11:05.966
(opens drawer)
 I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.297
Remember what's at stake
for you

11:07.297 --> 11:09.299
if you don't find
the Carrion program.

11:09.299 --> 11:11.942
(closes drawer)
 NOT A MOMENT GOES BY
THAT I DON'T.

11:11.942 --> 11:13.944
YOU'RE ONE OF MANY IRONS
I HAVE IN THE FIRE.

11:13.944 --> 11:16.676
DON'T GIVE ME A REASON
TO PULL YOU OUT.

11:18.108 --> 11:19.810
(cell phone beeps,
clicks shut)

11:19.810 --> 11:21.852
(cell phone beeps and clatters)

11:21.852 --> 11:25.155
(objects rattling)

11:26.957 --> 11:28.418
LOOKING FOR...

11:28.418 --> 11:29.860
SOMETHING?

11:29.860 --> 11:31.121
(exhales)

11:31.121 --> 11:32.963
DAMN.

11:32.963 --> 11:34.094
(keys jangle)

11:34.094 --> 11:36.396
I WAS TRYING TO HIDE THIS
SO YOU'D FIND IT LATER.

11:38.068 --> 11:40.030
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THE PEDESTRIAN KEY,

11:40.030 --> 11:42.172
BUT I CAN CHANGE
WHAT YOU KEEP IT ON.

11:42.172 --> 11:44.304
HIS NAME IS HANUMAN.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.206
HE'S AN AVATAR OF SHIVA

11:46.206 --> 11:49.109
AND A DEITY THAT WINS
AGAINST DEMONS AND BAD SPIRITS.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.381
HE'LL KEEP YOU SAFE
IN YOUR NEW HOME.

11:54.985 --> 11:57.087
YOU STOPPED LISTENING
AT "AVATAR," DIDN'T YOU?

11:58.989 --> 12:01.321
I HEARD EVERY WORD
YOU SAID.

12:05.996 --> 12:07.727
THANK YOU...

12:07.727 --> 12:10.230
FOR ALWAYS LOOKING OUT
FOR ME.

12:15.005 --> 12:17.908
(Amanda) HAPPY 18th,
CHARLOTTE. (laughs)

12:17.908 --> 12:19.209
FROM YOUR NEPHEW.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.844
AW. IT'S CARL'S
LITTLE HANDPRINT.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.015
IT'S SO SWEET.

12:25.015 --> 12:26.046
18 IS A BIG ONE.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.748
YOU'RE INDEPENDENT, FREE.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.150
IN MY CASE,
I LITERALLY WAS,

12:30.150 --> 12:33.023
SINCE THAT WAS THE YEAR
I WAS RELEASED FROM JUVIE.

12:33.023 --> 12:35.986
IT WAS ALSO THE YEAR
OUR DAD DIED.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.930
YEAH...

12:39.930 --> 12:42.893
IT WAS.

12:42.893 --> 12:44.835
I WISH
I HAD KNOWN YOU THEN.

12:44.835 --> 12:46.136
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT IT WAS LIKE

12:46.136 --> 12:48.768
TO LOSE THE ONLY FAMILY
YOU HAD.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.940
(whispers) THANKS.

12:51.141 --> 12:53.103
SPEAKING OF...

12:53.103 --> 12:54.374
WHERE'S YOURS?

12:54.374 --> 12:56.006
DANIEL FORGOT.

12:56.006 --> 12:58.108
MY FATHER
IS HOPEFULLY GETTING

12:58.108 --> 12:59.950
THE RYAN BROTHERS
OUT OF YOUR HAIR,

12:59.950 --> 13:01.952
AND I'M MEETING MY MOM
IN THE CITY TONIGHT

13:01.952 --> 13:03.083
FOR THE BALLET.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.885
IT'S KIND OF A TRADITION.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.116
(cell phone ringing)

13:06.116 --> 13:08.889
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.
 (beep)

13:08.889 --> 13:11.121
SO WHAT'S THE PROGRAM TONIGHT?
I PRAY IT'S BALANCHINE.

13:11.121 --> 13:13.123
(Victoria) WELL,
THAT'S JUST IT, CHARLOTTE.

13:13.123 --> 13:15.966
EVERYTHING'S OKAY, BUT I
HAD TO LEAVE TOWN SUDDENLY,

13:15.966 --> 13:17.097
and I won't be back
until tomorrow.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.798
But I promise
 to make it up to you.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.370
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

13:20.370 --> 13:22.472
YOU DO KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU,
DON'T YOU?

13:22.472 --> 13:24.204
YES.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.536
GOOD. THEN KEEP THAT
CLOSE TO YOUR HEART

13:26.536 --> 13:28.538
TILL I GET BACK TOMORROW.
 OKAY, THANKS. I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THAT, MR. PROSSER.

13:28.538 --> 13:31.411
(beep)

13:31.411 --> 13:34.584
WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN YOUR MOM
CANCELS YOUR BIRTHDAY?

13:34.584 --> 13:38.188
I'D SAY
IT'S HER GIFT TO YOU.

13:38.188 --> 13:40.951
(exhales)

13:40.951 --> 13:42.022
I GUESS BEING A GRAYSON

13:42.022 --> 13:44.024
JUST MEANS LEARNING TO LIVE
WITH DISAPPOINTMENT.

13:45.055 --> 13:47.958
YOU'RE NOT A GRAYSON.

13:47.958 --> 13:50.030
NOT REALLY.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.404
(indistinct conversations)

13:54.404 --> 13:56.236
VICTORIA?

13:56.236 --> 13:59.139
(laughs)
 I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.510
JASON. (kisses)

14:00.510 --> 14:02.012
I AM PEEVED WITH YOU.

14:02.012 --> 14:03.173
IT SEEMS
THAT YOU'VE THROWN YOUR HAT

14:03.173 --> 14:04.444
INTO THE STONEHAVEN RING.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.217
SIMPLY MY COMPULSION
TO LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED.

14:07.217 --> 14:10.050
WELL, THEN AS A MAJOR
SHAREHOLDER OF GRAYSON GLOBAL,

14:10.050 --> 14:11.952
LET ME DISABUSE YOU
OF YOUR PESSIMISTIC OUTLOOK.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.084
AREN'T YOU STILL
MY COMPETITION?

14:14.084 --> 14:16.086
BUSINESS MAKES
FOR STRANGE BEDFELLOWS.

14:16.086 --> 14:17.928
MY SON,
THOUGH WELL-INTENTIONED,

14:17.928 --> 14:19.990
IS NOT READY
FOR THIS ACQUISITION.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.531
SO I'M HERE TO PROTECT
THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

14:21.531 --> 14:23.894
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME.

14:23.894 --> 14:26.296
ONLY THAT YOU WOULD MAKE
AN EXCELLENT STEWARD

14:26.296 --> 14:27.998
FOR STONEHAVEN.

14:27.998 --> 14:30.070
(chuckles)
AND SHOULD THAT COME TO PASS,

14:30.070 --> 14:32.973
I HOPE YOU'LL ALLOW ME
TO THANK YOU LATER.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.075
AS FOR NOW, I HAVE
A MEETING TO GET TO.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.953
OH, YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

14:42.953 --> 14:45.285
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.
YOU CROSSED THE COUNTRY

14:45.285 --> 14:47.157
TO LURE THAT RAT
INTO HELPING YOU.

14:47.157 --> 14:48.488
I JUST BUMPED INTO HIM.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.020
OH.
 I'M HERE FOR YOU, DANIEL.

14:50.020 --> 14:51.992
ALTHOUGH I SEE THAT YOU
BROUGHT REINFORCEMENTS.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.463
YEAH, IT'S NICE TO HAVE
SOMEONE'S UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT.

14:53.463 --> 14:56.096
WELL, THEN ALLOW ME
TO OFFER YOU MINE.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.067
NOW IF YOUR INTENTION

14:57.067 --> 14:58.528
IS TO REHABILITATE
GRAYSON GLOBAL'S IMAGE,

14:58.528 --> 14:59.899
I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU

14:59.899 --> 15:01.531
TO NOT GO THROUGH
WITH THIS ACQUISITION.

15:01.531 --> 15:03.503
WHY, BECAUSE I'LL AFFIRM
MY STANDING AS C.E.O.?

15:03.503 --> 15:05.035
NO, QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

15:05.035 --> 15:07.107
THESE DISASTER-RELIEF COMPANIES
SWIM IN DIRTY POOLS,

15:07.107 --> 15:09.209
AND STONEHAVEN
IS NO EXCEPTION.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.211
THEY'RE NOT HUMANITARIANS.
THEY ARE PROFITEERS.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.542
ARE YOU REALLY TRYING
TO TAKE THE MORAL HIGH GROUND?

15:12.542 --> 15:14.084
(lowered voice) HAVE YOU
FORGOTTEN WHAT YOU ARE,

15:14.084 --> 15:15.385
WHAT YOU'VE PROFITED FROM?

15:15.385 --> 15:18.048
I SUGGEST YOU THAT YOU
DO YOUR RESEARCH

15:18.048 --> 15:20.150
AND FIND OUT WHY
THESE PEOPLE WANT YOU TO--
 DO MY RESEARCH? YOU WANT ME
TO DO MY RESEARCH?

15:20.150 --> 15:21.451
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO UPSTAIRS

15:21.451 --> 15:24.995
BEFORE YOU SAY SOMETHING
YOU REGRET IN PUBLIC.

15:26.256 --> 15:28.098
THINK ABOUT IT.

15:28.098 --> 15:29.059
YEAH.

15:29.059 --> 15:31.061
(sighs)

15:31.061 --> 15:33.263
I ASSUME, PER OUR AGREEMENT,
YOU'RE HERE TO DISSUADE MY SON

15:33.263 --> 15:35.265
FROM GOING THROUGH
WITH THIS ACQUISITION?

15:35.265 --> 15:37.107
YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN TO ME
EXACTLY WHY

15:37.107 --> 15:38.969
YOU ARE SO SET AGAINST IT.

15:38.969 --> 15:40.610
DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND
A WORD I SAID?

15:40.610 --> 15:42.642
THIS IS NOT
IN DANIEL'S BEST INTEREST.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.474
AND UNLIKE MY SON,
PROSSER CAN HOLD HIS OWN.

15:44.474 --> 15:45.976
NOW HE'S SITTING
ON THE FENCE,

15:45.976 --> 15:48.348
AND I'M HERE TO PUSH HIM
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

15:51.081 --> 15:54.454
(cell phone auto-dials)

15:54.454 --> 15:55.625
(phone rings)

15:55.625 --> 15:56.987
(line clicks)

15:56.987 --> 15:58.158
(Aiden) There you are.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.329
AIDEN,

15:59.329 --> 16:01.161
LISTEN, I DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME TO EXPLAIN,

16:01.161 --> 16:04.094
BUT DANIEL DECIDED TO SWEEP ME
OFF TO L.A.

16:04.094 --> 16:05.965
TO HELP HIM GET STONEHAVEN.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.167
And I'm sure he thinks
you'll seal the deal

16:07.167 --> 16:10.070
in that blue dress
you're wearing.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.042
BEHIND YOU.

16:13.743 --> 16:15.575
(beep)

16:24.254 --> 16:25.415
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING IN L.A.?

16:25.415 --> 16:26.586
FUNNY, I THOUGHT
THE SAME THING

16:26.586 --> 16:28.018
WHEN I SAW YOU
IN THE LOBBY WITH DANIEL.

16:28.018 --> 16:29.759
YOU'RE SAYING
YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW US?

16:29.759 --> 16:31.291
WHILE I'M NOT THRILLED
YOUR LUNCH DATE

16:31.291 --> 16:32.422
TURNED INTO A CHANGE
OF TIME ZONES,

16:32.422 --> 16:34.124
I DO TRUST YOU, EMILY.

16:34.124 --> 16:36.396
THEN WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

16:36.396 --> 16:39.769
HELEN FOUND ME.

16:39.769 --> 16:43.273
OUR LITTLE RUSE
AT THE AUCTION WORKED.

16:43.273 --> 16:44.604
SHE BELIEVES VICTORIA'S
BEHIND EVERYTHING.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.136
NOW SHE WANTS PROOF
OF HER MEDDLING

16:46.136 --> 16:49.139
WITH
THE INITIATIVE'S PLANS.

16:49.139 --> 16:50.280
HOW CAN I HELP?

16:50.280 --> 16:52.382
GO BACK TO NEW YORK.

16:52.382 --> 16:54.214
IF THEY BELIEVE YOU'RE
IN LEAGUE WITH VICTORIA,

16:54.214 --> 16:56.015
IT COULD HAVE
DIRE CONSEQUENCES.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.247
I CAN'T LEAVE, AIDEN.

16:57.247 --> 16:58.618
IF DANIEL LOSES STONEHAVEN,

16:58.618 --> 17:00.290
WE LOSE OUR LINK
TO THE INITIATIVE.

17:00.290 --> 17:03.093
WELL, THEN OUR MISSIONS
ARE AT ODDS.

17:05.255 --> 17:07.497
(sighs) MAYBE NOT.

17:07.497 --> 17:09.459
PROSSER KNOWS
THAT I'M WITH DANIEL,

17:09.459 --> 17:12.162
SO I CAN'T DISSUADE HIM,
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN.

17:12.162 --> 17:13.703
TO WHAT END?

17:13.703 --> 17:16.336
MAKING STONEHAVEN
A SURE THING FOR DANIEL

17:16.336 --> 17:20.170
FORCES VICTORIA
TO EXPOSE HER TRUE INTENT.

17:20.170 --> 17:22.311
AND IF I'M SUCCESSFUL,

17:22.311 --> 17:23.713
YOU'LL GO?

17:23.713 --> 17:26.376
I'LL HAVE NO REASON
TO STAY.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.256
THEY RELEASE YOU?

17:36.256 --> 17:37.787
OH, HEY.

17:37.787 --> 17:40.260
NO, UH...
INSURANCE RAN OUT,

17:40.260 --> 17:42.292
SO I FIGURE
I'D GIVE MY GIRLS

17:42.292 --> 17:45.435
A CHANCE TO TAKE CARE
OF THE OLD MAN.

17:45.435 --> 17:47.567
HOW YOU DOING, JACK?

17:48.838 --> 17:51.141
NOT SO GOOD.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.374
THE RYANS FRAMED ME
WITH A DRUG CHARGE.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.545
I WAS ARRESTED,

17:55.545 --> 17:57.607
AND THE POLICE
FOUND A GUN ON MY BOAT.

17:57.607 --> 17:59.749
AND SINCE
IT'S A MURDER WEAPON--

17:59.749 --> 18:01.581
I TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM THEM.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.453
YOU--YOU SHOULD'VE LISTENED.

18:03.453 --> 18:05.285
THAT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE
THE PAST, MATT.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.786
THEY'RE GONNA PIN
JOE RYAN'S MURDER ON ME.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.718
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
THE ONE THAT YOU'RE GUILTY OF.

18:08.718 --> 18:11.161
AND YOU WANT ME TO CONFESS?

18:11.161 --> 18:12.592
I KNOW THIS STILL WEIGHS
ON YOUR CONSCIENCE,

18:12.592 --> 18:14.224
OR YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TOLD ME
YOU DID IT.

18:14.224 --> 18:15.425
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

18:15.425 --> 18:17.297
TO HAVE SOMEONE
HURT YOUR CHILD.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.769
AND, YEAH,
IT WEIGHS ON ME.

18:19.769 --> 18:22.202
BUT I LEARNED
TO LIVE WITH IT.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.306
WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME
FOR MY DAD.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.778
YOU HEARD ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED, RIGHT?

18:28.778 --> 18:30.410
HEART ATTACK AT 52.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.812
MY KID NEVER GOT A CHANCE
TO MEET HIM.

18:32.812 --> 18:36.216
YOU WANT HIM GROWING UP
WITHOUT A FATHER, TOO?

18:37.647 --> 18:40.790
ANOTHER COPY
OF MY ROOM KEY, PLEASE.
 OKAY.

18:40.790 --> 18:42.622
ALWAYS THE SIGN
OF A GOOD VISIT.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.324
(indistinct conversations)

18:44.324 --> 18:45.295
NOW YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS,

18:45.295 --> 18:48.127
BUT THAT "FORBES" COVER
DID YOU NO FAVORS.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.400
AIRBRUSHES
ARE FOR SUPER MODELS.

18:50.400 --> 18:51.661
LAST THING I NEED

18:51.661 --> 18:53.703
IS FOR PEOPLE BELIEVING
I'VE GONE SOFT.

18:53.703 --> 18:55.435
THE MAN WHO SHORTED
THE SUBPRIME COLLAPSE?

18:55.435 --> 18:56.666
NO CHANCE.

18:56.666 --> 18:58.308
SO, UH, WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO L.A.?

18:58.308 --> 19:00.210
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:00.210 --> 19:01.911
THAT YOU'RE HERE
FOR STONEHAVEN.

19:03.313 --> 19:04.644
MY BOSS HAS
A SIGNIFICANT INTEREST

19:04.644 --> 19:06.346
IN GRAYSON GLOBAL.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.477
HE SENT ME
TO MONITOR NEGOTIATIONS.

19:07.477 --> 19:09.179
RIGHT. SATOSHI TAKEDA.

19:09.179 --> 19:10.480
I RECOGNIZE YOU
FROM THE WINE AUCTION.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.183
MM-HMM. I-I-I DID
READ THE "FORBES" PIECE

19:13.183 --> 19:14.754
ABOUT YOUR PASSION
TO ACQUIRE BUSINESSES

19:14.754 --> 19:15.925
THAT ARE GOOD FOR THE SOUL.

19:15.925 --> 19:17.827
IS--IS THAT FOR REAL?

19:17.827 --> 19:20.460
IT'S MY NEW PHILOSOPHY,
YES.

19:20.460 --> 19:24.234
WELL, THEN THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

19:24.234 --> 19:26.165
A FRIEND AT THE D.O.J.
INFORMED ME

19:26.165 --> 19:28.698
THAT DONNA CARLISLE IS LOOKING
TO DUMP HER FATHER'S COMPANY

19:28.698 --> 19:30.800
IN ADVANCE OF AN INDICTMENT,

19:30.800 --> 19:33.172
AND THE LUCKY WINNER
INHERITS THE LAWSUIT.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.604
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

19:34.604 --> 19:36.446
PROFESSIONAL RESPECT...

19:36.446 --> 19:37.807
AND FOR MY SOUL.

19:39.649 --> 19:41.180
BUT LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.313
MORE TIME TO SPEND WITH
WHOEVER'S GETTING THAT KEY.

19:43.313 --> 19:44.914

20:13.643 --> 20:16.246
HELPING TO CLEAR YOUR PARTNER'S
BOGUS DRUG CHARGES.

20:16.246 --> 20:19.919
HEY, DOES THE NAME
MATTHEW DUNCAN RING A BELL?

20:25.895 --> 20:28.498
IN THIS ENVELOPE
IS MR. DUNCAN'S CONFESSION

20:28.498 --> 20:30.560

20:30.560 --> 20:34.364
I'M GONNA MAKE THIS...

I HAVE MY ANSWER.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.392
WERE YOU PLANNING ON LEAVING
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE?

21:02.392 --> 21:03.563
IT SEEMED CONSISTENT

21:03.563 --> 21:06.466
WITH YOUR AVERSION
TO OPEN COMMUNICATION.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.767
SOME GUY IN THE LOBBY

21:07.767 --> 21:10.440
TOLD ME ABOUT STONEHAVEN'S
PENDING LAWSUIT.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.941
WELL, THEN YOU WERE LIED TO.

21:11.941 --> 21:13.573

VICTORIA.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.951
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

21:21.951 --> 21:24.684
YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD A STRENGTH
AND CLARITY OF PURPOSE

21:24.684 --> 21:26.386
THAT I ADMIRED
FROM THE FIRST DAY WE MET.

21:33.393 --> 21:36.696

21:36.696 --> 21:39.499

ARE YOU?

21:39.499 --> 21:41.401
NO.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.803

21:43.803 --> 21:45.505

BROKE.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.710
THAT'S RIGHT.

21:56.916 --> 22:00.620
DAVID MADE HIMSELF VULNERABLE
TO THE WRONG PEOPLE.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.793

I THOUGHT THE WORLD
WAS ENDING.

26:12.301 --> 26:14.874

LOOTED, BURNED TO THE GROUND.

26:14.874 --> 26:16.045
REALLY?

26:16.045 --> 26:18.878
YOU KNOW, MY FATHER HELPED

26:18.878 --> 26:20.650
THAT WHOLE BOROUGH.

26:20.650 --> 26:22.311

ABOUT THE BLACKOUT IS,

26:32.992 --> 26:34.964
NOT DESTROY IT.

26:34.964 --> 26:36.866
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE

AFTER 9/11?

26:39.999 --> 26:43.703
I WAS NEVER INVOLVED
IN THOSE TRANSACTIONS.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.004
BUT YOUR SUBSIDIARIES WERE.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.076

I'M NOT ONLY ACCOUNTABLE
FOR MY OWN ACTIONS,

26:49.338 --> 26:51.010

WORKING UNDER ME.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.812
WHY IS NONE OF THIS
PUBLIC RECORD?

26:52.812 --> 26:54.914
WELL, BECAUSE THE LAWSUITS
WERE ALL SETTLED AND BURIED.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.916
THAT'S A FINE ALLEGATION
COMING FROM A GRAYSON.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.218
OH, DON'T CONFUSE MY RECORD
WITH MY FATHER'S. ALL RIGHT?

26:59.218 --> 27:01.090
LISTEN, DONNA,

27:01.090 --> 27:02.922

27:02.922 --> 27:05.254
HE'D BE GREATLY DISAPPOINTED

28:05.885 --> 28:08.017
(beep)
 (exhales)

28:08.017 --> 28:10.760
WHY THE HELL WOULDN'T AIDEN
TELL ME ABOUT THIS?

28:10.760 --> 28:12.061
WELL, PERHAPS
IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO

28:12.061 --> 28:15.464
WITH THE SUBJECT LINE--
"A LIFE FOR A LIFE"?

28:15.464 --> 28:18.327
We know he's trying
to save his sister, but...

28:18.327 --> 28:19.999
WHO'S THE TARGET?

28:19.999 --> 28:21.470
(sighs)

28:21.470 --> 28:23.032
VICTORIA.

28:24.273 --> 28:27.076
TRACK HIS PHONE
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

28:34.083 --> 28:35.244
JASON.

28:35.244 --> 28:36.946
YOU AND YOUR SON
MAKE AN ADMIRABLE TEAM.

28:36.946 --> 28:38.217
YOU SET ME UP,

28:38.217 --> 28:39.789
AND HE AND THAT WOMAN
ON HIS ARM KNOCK ME DOWN.

28:39.789 --> 28:41.350
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

28:41.350 --> 28:42.321
EXACTLY WHAT YOU KNEW
WOULD HAPPEN.

28:42.321 --> 28:43.793
ANOTHER GRAYSON VICTORY.

28:43.793 --> 28:45.294
JASON, MY SON
IS IN GRAVE DANGER.

28:45.294 --> 28:46.455
I SWEAR THAT I HAVE--

28:46.455 --> 28:48.958
WHATEVER TROUBLE HE'S IN,
HE DESERVES IT.

28:48.958 --> 28:50.459
AND YOU'VE EARNED
WHATEVER HEARTBREAK IT BRINGS.

28:50.459 --> 28:52.261
WHAT ARE YOU...

28:58.307 --> 29:00.269
AIDEN!
 DAMN IT!

29:00.269 --> 29:02.411
(panting)

29:02.411 --> 29:04.013
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

29:04.013 --> 29:05.174
AND IF I HAD?

29:05.174 --> 29:06.475
I KNOW VICTORIA
BELONGS TO YOU.

29:06.475 --> 29:09.448
(exhales)

29:09.448 --> 29:10.950
I SAW THE VIDEO.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.452
I HAD NOLAN
HACK INTO YOUR PHONE.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.754
IS IT REALLY HER?

29:15.754 --> 29:17.356
I'M CERTAIN OF IT.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.328
(closes zipper)

29:19.328 --> 29:23.362
LOOK, I KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE PROMISING YOU,

29:23.362 --> 29:25.835
BUT YOU CAN'T LET THEM
TURN YOU INTO THEIR ASSASSIN.

29:25.835 --> 29:27.166
IF I DON'T,

29:27.166 --> 29:28.497
THEN I'VE FAILED HER
FOR THE SECOND TIME.

29:28.497 --> 29:30.169
AND IF YOU DO, THEN YOU
GIVE THEM ALL THE POWER.

29:30.169 --> 29:32.802
LISTEN TO ME, RIGHT NOW DANIEL'S
VICTORY IS THEIR MAIN CONCERN,

29:32.802 --> 29:33.973
AND THEY HAVE THAT.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.144
YOU KILL HIS MOTHER,

29:35.144 --> 29:36.846
YOU DISTRACT HIM,
FROM THEIR MAIN PURPOSE.

29:36.846 --> 29:38.948
TELL HELEN THAT YOU
REALIZED THIS, AND INSTEAD,

29:38.948 --> 29:40.810
YOU HELPED SEAL DANIEL'S
VICTORY OVER PROSSER.

29:40.810 --> 29:44.413
(pants)

29:44.413 --> 29:45.915
OKAY?

29:47.486 --> 29:50.089
LOOK,
I'M GOING BACK TONIGHT.

29:50.089 --> 29:52.191
YOU SHOULD, TOO.

29:52.191 --> 29:55.424
(exhales)
WE'RE GONNA FIND YOUR SISTER.

29:55.424 --> 29:57.927
BUT ON OUR OWN TERMS,
NOT THEIRS.

29:57.927 --> 29:59.398
AND WHEN WE DO,
WE ARE GONNA MAKE THEM PAY

29:59.398 --> 30:01.100
FOR EVERY SECOND
THEY KEPT YOU APART.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.972
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

30:17.416 --> 30:19.388
HOME AGAIN. HOME AGAIN.

30:19.388 --> 30:21.420
(sighs) YEAH, WE DON'T
HAVE TO BE, YOU KNOW?

30:21.420 --> 30:23.492
I MEAN,
WE CAN REFUEL THE JET,

30:23.492 --> 30:25.394
HEAD TO THE BAHAMAS,
THE AZORES--

30:25.394 --> 30:27.826
ANYWHERE WITHOUT BUSINESS
OR MY MOTHER.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.499
I THINK I JUST WANT
MY OWN BED.

30:30.499 --> 30:33.362
BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE
WE CAN PLAN ANOTHER TRIP

30:33.362 --> 30:35.334
SOMETIME SOON.

30:35.334 --> 30:38.337
(jet engine whirring)

30:40.469 --> 30:43.412
(Padma) JUST GOT YOUR E-MAIL.
BIDDING ON THE HOUSE?

30:43.412 --> 30:45.474
DID YOU KNOW

30:45.474 --> 30:47.476
THAT THERE WAS
A SECRET PASSAGE?

30:47.476 --> 30:50.219
BECAUSE I AM TOTALLY HOSTING
A MURDER-MYSTERY DINNER.

30:50.219 --> 30:52.121
THAT'S WHAT FINALLY
GOT YOU TO COMMIT,

30:52.121 --> 30:53.352
A SECRET PASSAGE?

30:53.352 --> 30:56.185
MM, AND, UH...

30:56.185 --> 30:58.527
SOMEONE
TO WALK THROUGH IT WITH?

30:58.527 --> 31:01.490
I DON'T KNOW, NOLAN.

31:01.490 --> 31:02.992
AFTER EVERYTHING
WITH MARCO--

31:02.992 --> 31:05.364
HEY, MY FEELINGS
FOR GROUCHO SNARX

31:05.364 --> 31:09.038
WERE FLEETING AND...

31:09.038 --> 31:10.639
AND A MISTAKE.

31:10.639 --> 31:13.102
I MEAN, HE WAS ONLY
AFTER ONE THING,

31:13.102 --> 31:14.373
AND IT WASN'T ME.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.205
JUST...

31:16.205 --> 31:18.948
SOME DUSTY
OLD COMPUTER PROGRAM.

31:18.948 --> 31:20.309
YOU MEAN CARRION?

31:24.113 --> 31:25.414
RIGHT.

31:27.056 --> 31:29.058
(knock on door)

31:36.465 --> 31:38.597
VICTORIA.

31:38.597 --> 31:40.429
HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT BACK?

31:40.429 --> 31:42.331
YOU KNOW, YOU AND I
COULD STAND HERE ALL DAY

31:42.331 --> 31:45.334
TRADING BARBS AND NETTLING
EACH OTHER'S LAST NERVES,

31:45.334 --> 31:47.576
OR WE CAN CUT THE CRAP.

31:47.576 --> 31:50.579
WHY DID YOU ACCOMPANY MY SON
TO CALIFORNIA?

31:50.579 --> 31:52.641
BECAUSE HE ASKED ME TO.

31:52.641 --> 31:54.643
AND I THOUGHT
I COULD SWAY HIM.

31:54.643 --> 31:56.685
YES, BUT IN WHICH DIRECTION?

31:56.685 --> 31:58.347
I WAS FORCED TO WALK
A FINE LINE

31:58.347 --> 32:00.049
BETWEEN MY ALLEGIANCE TO YOU

32:00.049 --> 32:02.021
AND MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH DANIEL.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.452
SURELY YOU COULD UNDERSTAND,

32:03.452 --> 32:05.454
SEEING AS YOU'VE JUST DONE
THE SAME WITH PROSSER.

32:05.454 --> 32:06.956
WELL, THE DIFFERENCE IS

32:06.956 --> 32:09.458
THAT MY SON FLOATS THROUGH LIFE
ON CRESTS OF WOMEN,

32:09.458 --> 32:11.460
UNABLE TO MAKE
HIS OWN DECISIONS.

32:11.460 --> 32:14.403
YOU COULD'VE DISSUADED HIM
AT ANY POINT. WHY DIDN'T YOU?

32:16.966 --> 32:19.668
I GUESS I WANTED
TO SEE HIM WIN.

32:19.668 --> 32:23.572
YOU SELFISH LITTLE GIRL.

32:23.572 --> 32:27.146
IN DOING SO, YOU MAY HAVE
CAUSED HIM HIS GREATEST LOSS.

32:32.982 --> 32:34.523
(sighs)

32:40.429 --> 32:41.430
(door opens)

32:41.430 --> 32:43.132
(Emily) NOLAN?
 (door closes)

32:43.132 --> 32:46.065
(Nolan chuckles)
WELCOME BACK.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.467
I READ ABOUT
HOW THE WEST WAS WON.

32:48.467 --> 32:52.341
I HOPE I HELPED THE CAUSE
WITH YOUR FAUX BEAU.

32:53.372 --> 32:56.745
I THINK I'M GAINING
HIS CONFIDENCE BACK.

32:56.745 --> 32:59.008
BUT I MIGHT BE
LOSING VICTORIA'S.

32:59.008 --> 33:00.509
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

33:00.509 --> 33:02.381
BEFORE SHE POISONS ME
TO DANIEL.

33:02.381 --> 33:04.513
WELL, NOT IF YOU
POISON HER FIRST,

33:04.513 --> 33:07.486
WHICH IS A FAR MORE FITTING END
THAN A BULLET,

33:07.486 --> 33:10.419
DON'T YOU THINK?
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

33:10.419 --> 33:12.391
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM THOMAS CROWN?

33:15.364 --> 33:17.466
WELL, I'VE TRIED
TRIANGULATING HIS PHONE.

33:17.466 --> 33:19.498
HE'S EITHER JAMMED IT
OR DUMPED IT.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.670
I JUST HOPE
I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.633
I KNOW I DIDN'T.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.378
WITH THE HOUSE?

33:29.378 --> 33:32.581
ISN'T THIS THE ONE
THAT I'M BUYING YOU?

33:32.581 --> 33:34.513
I DON'T THINK SO.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.515
(jangles keys)

33:36.515 --> 33:38.217
IT SEEMS NOTHING

33:38.217 --> 33:41.590
CAN SAVE ME
FROM EVIL SPIRITS.

33:41.590 --> 33:43.052
(clink)

33:43.052 --> 33:45.424
11 YEARS AGO,

33:45.424 --> 33:47.126
I STARTED WORKING
ON SOMETHING.

33:47.126 --> 33:49.358
HAVE I TOLD YOU
WHAT CARRION IS?

33:49.358 --> 33:51.060
ROTTING MEAT?

33:51.060 --> 33:52.731
MM, IN THE FORM
OF A MILLION LINES

33:52.731 --> 33:55.734
OF BINARY BRILLIANCE THAT...

33:55.734 --> 33:58.407
HAVE THE ABILITY TO KNOCK
MANHATTAN OFF THE POWER GRID

33:58.407 --> 34:00.509
IN LESS THAN A MILLISECOND.

34:00.509 --> 34:02.371
(sighs)

34:02.371 --> 34:04.543
THAT'S WHAT MARCO
WAS LOOKING FOR.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.315
RIGHT PROGRAM,

34:06.315 --> 34:09.478
WRONG C.F.O.

34:09.478 --> 34:14.152
LAST WEEK, PADMA REFERRED
TO CARRION AS A PERSON.

34:14.152 --> 34:18.357
AND TODAY
SHE CALLED IT A PROGRAM.

34:18.357 --> 34:19.788
I NEVER TOLD HER THAT.

34:19.788 --> 34:22.130
I'M SORRY, NOLAN.

34:24.132 --> 34:25.494
DID SHE GET HER HANDS
ON IT?

34:25.494 --> 34:26.465
NO.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.667
AND EVEN IF SHE HAD,
IT'S UNFINISHED.

34:28.667 --> 34:32.271
I KEEP THE FINAL SEQUENCE
LOCKED UP IN HERE.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.572
THE TIMING
CAN'T BE A COINCIDENCE.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.105
PADMA PLAYED
AN INSTRUMENTAL ROLE

34:36.105 --> 34:38.206
IN ACQUIRING NolCorp
WHILE SEEKING OUT CARRION,

34:38.206 --> 34:42.411
AND NOW DANIEL'S LATEST PURCHASE
IS A DISASTER RECOVERY FIRM?

34:42.411 --> 34:44.753
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

34:44.753 --> 34:47.856
THAT'S THE INITIATIVE'S
MASTER PLAN,

34:47.856 --> 34:49.658
TURNING OUT THE LIGHTS?

34:49.658 --> 34:53.621
WHAT CONCERNS ME
IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY DO.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.227
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN
FOR PADMA?

34:58.227 --> 34:59.528
(sighs)

34:59.528 --> 35:01.700
I DON'T KNOW YET.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.802
MY ADVICE?

35:03.802 --> 35:06.835
PLAY HER
LIKE SHE'S PLAYING YOU.

35:16.645 --> 35:19.348
DAD?

35:19.348 --> 35:21.119
MOM?

35:21.119 --> 35:23.252
BON ANNIVERSAIRE, MA BELLE.

35:23.252 --> 35:24.423
OHH. (kisses)

35:24.423 --> 35:25.594
I THOUGHT YOU CANCELED
MY BIRTHDAY.

35:25.594 --> 35:26.725
NEVER.
 (Daniel) WE RESCHEDULED IT.

35:26.725 --> 35:27.896
WE'RE CELEBRATING YOU,
SWEETHEART,

35:27.896 --> 35:29.498
NOT THE GREGORIAN CALENDAR.

35:29.498 --> 35:30.829
GO ON.
BLOW OUT THE CANDLES.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.901
I ONLY HAVE ONE WISH
THIS YEAR.

35:32.901 --> 35:34.833
ANYTHING.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.835
I HAVE SPENT
THE LAST TWO DAYS

35:36.835 --> 35:38.507
THINKING ABOUT FAMILY

35:38.507 --> 35:40.138
AND WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE A DAUGHTER,

35:40.138 --> 35:42.140
A SISTER, AND NOW AN ADULT.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.772
AND MY ONLY WISH

35:43.772 --> 35:47.476
IS THAT YOU SUPPORT
MY FIRST ADULT DECISION.

35:47.476 --> 35:49.878
I'M CHANGING MY NAME.

35:49.878 --> 35:52.351
I FILED PAPERS
AT THE COURTHOUSE TODAY.

35:52.351 --> 35:55.884
YOU CAN NOW CALL ME
CHARLOTTE CLARKE.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.363
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CHARLOTTE.

36:04.363 --> 36:05.694
FROM ME AND DANIEL.

36:05.694 --> 36:08.197
EMILY.

36:08.197 --> 36:10.799
WELL, I DIDN'T REALIZE
WE'D EXTENDED INVITATIONS.

36:10.799 --> 36:12.801
EMILY DOESN'T NEED ONE.

36:12.801 --> 36:16.475
LET'S GET YOU A DRINK.
LOVE YOU, SIS.

36:20.579 --> 36:21.810
(liquid pours)

36:21.810 --> 36:25.514
I HOPE I DIDN'T INTERRUPT
YOUR TIME WITH YOUR FAMILY.

36:25.514 --> 36:27.356
(bottle clinks)
 TRUST ME, I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE AROUND

36:27.356 --> 36:29.488
FOR THE AFTERMATH
OF CHARLOTTE'S ANNOUNCEMENT.

36:29.488 --> 36:31.260
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT HELL

36:31.260 --> 36:33.592
MY DAD'S GIVING HER
RIGHT NOW.

36:40.499 --> 36:43.332
(sighs)
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

36:44.633 --> 36:46.375
OH, I CAN'T DO THIS.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.279
(sets glass down)

36:50.279 --> 36:52.281
I'M SORRY. I NEED
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

36:54.483 --> 36:56.285
A FEW WEEKS AGO,

36:56.285 --> 36:59.548
VICTORIA ASKED ME
TO REKINDLE OUR RELATIONSHIP.

36:59.548 --> 37:01.790
SHE WANTED SOMEBODY
TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOU

37:01.790 --> 37:03.822
DURING YOUR TRANSITION
AT WORK.

37:03.822 --> 37:06.525
I SAID YES.

37:06.525 --> 37:09.998
SO YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO LEAKED STONEHAVEN TO HER.

37:09.998 --> 37:12.461
WHICH IS WHY I FOUGHT SO HARD
TO HELP YOU WIN IT BACK.

37:12.461 --> 37:14.303
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

37:14.303 --> 37:17.536
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING IT
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

37:19.308 --> 37:21.440
YOU MUST THINK
I'M AN IDIOT.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.443
THERE ISN'T A SINGLE ASPECT
OF MY LIFE

37:24.443 --> 37:26.445
THAT MY MOTHER
HASN'T MEDDLED IN.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.649
YOU KNEW?

37:30.649 --> 37:33.822
I MEAN,
I-I STRONGLY SUSPECTED.

37:33.822 --> 37:36.525
HER PLANS SO RARELY
BREAK IN MY FAVOR,

37:36.525 --> 37:40.258
I GUESS I JUST
STUCK MY HEAD IN THE SAND.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.461
IN ALL FAIRNESS,
I GUESS I WAS USING YOU

37:42.461 --> 37:45.564
AS MUCH AS YOU WERE ME.

37:45.564 --> 37:48.767
I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE HOW FAR
YOU WERE WILLING TO GO.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.570
(chuckles)

37:51.570 --> 37:53.642
WELL, NOW YOU KNOW.

37:55.944 --> 37:57.446
YOU THINK
WE'LL EVER GET BACK

37:57.446 --> 37:59.408
TO BEING THE PEOPLE
WE ONCE WERE?

38:02.611 --> 38:03.982
MAYBE.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.657
(sighs)
JUST NOT TONIGHT.

38:14.363 --> 38:16.665
(Declan) HEY, CAN YOU JUST
TELL ME WHAT YOU SAID TO MATT?

38:16.665 --> 38:17.826
HONESTLY, NOT MUCH.

38:17.826 --> 38:19.428
HE MUST HAVE HAD
A CRISIS OF CONSCIENCE.

38:19.428 --> 38:21.330
YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING, JACK.

38:21.330 --> 38:22.871
DADDY SAVED US.

38:22.871 --> 38:25.634
I'M JUST GLAD CONRAD
STOOD BY HIS WORD.

38:25.634 --> 38:26.605
HE GOT
THE DRUG CHARGES DROPPED

38:26.605 --> 38:28.577
AND BANISHED THE RYANS.
 OH, YEAH, BECAUSE NOW

38:28.577 --> 38:30.479
WE'RE BUSINESS PARTNERS
WITH CONRAD GRAYSON.

38:30.479 --> 38:31.640
I KNOW. IT'S NOT IDEAL.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.342
IDEAL? THE GUY WAS STEALING
MONEY FROM HIS DAUGHTER

38:33.342 --> 38:34.643
WHILE SHE WAS LOCKED UP
IN REHAB.

38:34.643 --> 38:35.844
ENOUGH, DECLAN.

38:35.844 --> 38:37.886
I'M INSTATING A BAN
ON ALL COMPLAINING,

38:37.886 --> 38:39.718
FROWNING,
AND NEGATIVE ATTITUDE.

38:39.718 --> 38:41.650
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ANY OF US.

38:46.495 --> 38:48.497
(Nate) I DIDN'T SIGN OFF
ON THIS DEAL.

38:48.497 --> 38:50.058
INK'S ALREADY DRY.

38:50.058 --> 38:53.001
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE THAT
UP WITH YOUR BROTHER, KENNETH.

38:53.001 --> 38:54.633
I'LL BUY IT BACK.

38:54.633 --> 38:55.864
$60,000.

38:57.606 --> 38:58.767
$65,000.

38:58.767 --> 39:00.569
LET ME SAVE YOU
THIS EMBARRASSING DISPLAY.

39:00.569 --> 39:02.941
EXCLUSIVE OF
YOUR 6-YEAR VENDETTA

39:02.941 --> 39:04.473
AGAINST THE WRONG MAN,

39:04.473 --> 39:07.646
I KNOW WHY YOU THINK
YOU WANT THE STOWAWAY.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.948
I HAVE BEEN APPROACHED
BY INVESTORS FOR DECADES

39:09.948 --> 39:11.950
WITH PLANS
TO DEVELOP THE DOCKS,

39:11.950 --> 39:15.353
AND EACH ONE HAS RESULTED
IN THE SAME CONCLUSION--

39:15.353 --> 39:17.486
THE OWNERS HAVE
VERY DEEP ROOTS,

39:17.486 --> 39:19.087
AND THEY AREN'T
GOING ANYWHERE.

39:19.087 --> 39:21.730
YOU LIVE IN THE CASTLE
ABOVE THE VILLAGE.

39:21.730 --> 39:24.032
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I KNOW,

39:24.032 --> 39:27.035
WHAT MY FATHER KNEW,
HOW THESE PEOPLE WORK.

39:27.035 --> 39:29.538
HE ALMOST HAD THE WATERFRONT
IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND.

39:29.538 --> 39:31.900
ALL WE NEED IS THE STOWAWAY,
AND WE CAN REGAIN

39:31.900 --> 39:33.902
THAT FOOTHOLD
THAT HE ONCE HAD.

39:33.902 --> 39:35.474
BY WHAT,
CHANGING COMMUNITY OPINION

39:35.474 --> 39:37.476
WITH TOWN HALL MEETINGS?

39:37.476 --> 39:39.578
NAH. WITH MUSCLE.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.880
APPLYING THE PROPER AMOUNT
OF PRESSURE,

39:41.880 --> 39:44.813
I CAN HAVE ROULETTE WHEELS
SPINNING BY MEMORIAL DAY.

39:44.813 --> 39:46.114
AH.

39:46.114 --> 39:49.588
OVERLY ARROGANT
AND AMBITIOUS.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.560
I LIKE THAT.

39:51.560 --> 39:52.891
THINK ABOUT IT.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.623
THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE JOBS
YOU'LL BE CREATING.

39:54.623 --> 39:56.995
IT'S RIGHT IN LINE
WITH YOUR NEW PUBLIC IMAGE.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.997
CONRAD, WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT THIS.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.168
YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:00.168 --> 40:02.771
WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD
TALK ABOUT THIS.

40:02.771 --> 40:04.503
ASHLEY, COULD YOU PLEASE
CLOSE THE DOOR?

40:09.808 --> 40:12.641
YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO PAY
FOR DINNER, YOU KNOW.

40:12.641 --> 40:14.513
WELL, CHIVALRY ISN'T DEAD.

40:14.513 --> 40:16.945
IT'S JUST SOMEWHERE
IN MY OFFICE.

40:16.945 --> 40:19.087
YOU SAID
IT'S YOUR PLATINUM CARD?

40:19.087 --> 40:20.549
It's probably

40:20.549 --> 40:21.890
NEXT TO MY COMPUTER
SOMEWHERE.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.494
AAH!

40:25.494 --> 40:26.955
(inhales sharply) OOH.

40:26.955 --> 40:29.728
I FORGOT TO WARN YOU
ABOUT THAT TRICK DRAWER.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.600
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL CLEAN IT UP.

40:31.600 --> 40:35.003
I STILL DON'T SEE
YOUR PLATINUM CARD.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.136
It'll turn up.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.768
I guess it is

40:39.768 --> 40:41.670
YOUR TURN TO PAY.

40:43.712 --> 40:45.443
DEAL.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.615
(beeps)

40:56.585 --> 41:00.689
(rapid beeping)

41:15.173 --> 41:17.475
AIDEN, WHAT HAPPENED?

41:17.475 --> 41:18.547
THE GRAYSONS
COULD SEE YOU--

41:18.547 --> 41:19.708
I DON'T CARE.

41:19.708 --> 41:21.580
(shoes clatter)

41:24.913 --> 41:27.055
(coughs)

41:27.055 --> 41:28.887
(moans)

41:28.887 --> 41:32.260
(labored breathing)

41:34.022 --> 41:36.064
(man) IT'S DONE.

41:38.196 --> 41:41.600
THEY MADE IT LOOK LIKE
AN OVERDOSE.

41:43.532 --> 41:44.803
AIDEN...

41:47.205 --> 41:50.539
AIDEN, I'M SO SORRY.

41:52.641 --> 41:54.643
BUT YOU CAN'T TRUST
THESE PEOPLE.

41:54.643 --> 41:57.285
YOU CAN'T TRUST THIS.

41:57.285 --> 41:58.817
LISTEN TO ME--

41:58.817 --> 42:00.689
LISTEN TO YOU?

42:00.689 --> 42:02.621
I DID LISTEN TO YOU,

42:02.621 --> 42:04.623
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW THIS HAPPENED.

42:04.623 --> 42:07.155
YOU MADE ME BELIEVE THAT
THEY WERE MANIPULATING ME,

42:07.155 --> 42:08.657
GIVING ME FALSE HOPE,

42:08.657 --> 42:10.999
WHEN IT'S YOU
 I SHOULDN'T HAVE TRUSTED.

42:12.661 --> 42:13.962
IF THERE'S A CHANCE
THAT MY SISTER'S ALIVE,

42:13.962 --> 42:15.203
THEN I'M GONNA FIND HER.

42:15.203 --> 42:18.607
AIDEN--
 AND IF SHE IS DEAD...

42:18.607 --> 42:20.939
THEN THIS IS ON YOU.

42:20.939 --> 42:22.971
AIDEN.

42:24.242 --> 42:26.615
AIDEN!

42:26.615 --> 42:29.618
(breathing heavily)
