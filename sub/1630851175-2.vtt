14:58.524 --> 15:00.995
In this dark time
in our nation's history,

15:01.029 --> 15:04.770
we must call on
our collective strength...

15:04.803 --> 15:06.473
I don't know why
anyone works here

15:06.507 --> 15:08.711
if they never have
any answers, right?

15:08.745 --> 15:09.980
They should just throw
everything in a pile,

15:10.013 --> 15:11.550
let us sort through it
ourselves.

15:11.584 --> 15:13.521
I've seen you before.

15:13.554 --> 15:15.792
We're always here
at the same time.

15:15.825 --> 15:17.662
Yeah.

15:20.635 --> 15:23.406
Who's, uh, who's this?

15:23.440 --> 15:25.477
‐Esme.
‐Salinger?

15:26.514 --> 15:28.417
My husband chose it.

15:28.450 --> 15:29.987
That's who you're looking for?

15:30.020 --> 15:31.690
You, too?

15:31.724 --> 15:33.293
This is
President Jennifer Brown...

15:33.326 --> 15:34.863
‐My brother.
‐In this dark time

15:34.897 --> 15:36.500
in our nation's history...

15:36.534 --> 15:39.305
Do you know where,
where he was? Or...

15:39.338 --> 15:42.579
Working. He wasn't even
supposed to go in that night.

15:42.612 --> 15:44.382
Someone was sick.

15:46.386 --> 15:48.323
Good luck with your brother.

15:48.356 --> 15:49.560
You, too.

15:49.593 --> 15:52.064
And we will rebuild together.

15:52.097 --> 15:54.402
Please follow the instructions
of government officials

15:54.435 --> 15:58.276
in order to make your evacuation
as safe as possible.

16:00.849 --> 16:02.986
SAM:
I couldn't find it

Course they did.

16:05.525 --> 16:07.896
First thing I'm looking for

16:07.929 --> 16:09.833
JESSE:
Why'd you have a Taser anyway?

16:09.867 --> 16:11.904
It was a prop for a show.

16:11.937 --> 16:14.075
‐Jesus.
‐What do you want, man?

16:14.108 --> 16:16.479
I thought I had it. Least now
we have the extra bike chain.

16:16.514 --> 16:17.716
SILAS:
Yeah, and only half the shit.

16:17.749 --> 16:20.087
Jesse's bike needs new treads.
We don't need shitty props.

16:20.120 --> 16:22.324
IAN:
Guys, look, we could wait
a couple days. It's all right.

16:22.358 --> 16:23.895
If they close the bridges,
we're screwed.

16:23.928 --> 16:25.832
We gotta go tonight.

16:25.865 --> 16:28.871
SILAS:
What the fuck, Hero?
Where have you been?

16:28.905 --> 16:31.042
JESSE:
Did you get
anything off the list?

16:31.075 --> 16:34.616
Uh, yeah. A Leatherman.

16:36.085 --> 16:38.891
You were supposed to get a
camping stove. We have a knife.

16:38.925 --> 16:40.862
Well, as it turns out,
you're not the first person

16:40.895 --> 16:42.699
to think of looting an REI.

16:47.609 --> 16:49.478
You, um, you gotta take it easy.

16:49.513 --> 16:51.550
He's an asshole.

16:51.584 --> 16:53.353
Yes.

16:55.157 --> 16:56.727
Where the hell have you been?

17:00.100 --> 17:01.704
Well, they're worried.

17:01.737 --> 17:03.106
They should be worried.

17:03.139 --> 17:04.610
They're biking to Vermont

17:04.643 --> 17:06.514
to live with Ian's
transphobic grandma?

17:06.547 --> 17:08.416
‐She fucking hates him.
‐Yeah, okay.

17:08.450 --> 17:10.120
Well, then evacuate
with everyone else.

17:10.153 --> 17:12.358
Sam, come on.
What are we gonna do

17:12.391 --> 17:13.661
in Vermont with Silas?

17:13.694 --> 17:16.099
Listen to yacht rock,
start a commune?

17:20.942 --> 17:23.146
Then let's leave.
Right now.

17:23.179 --> 17:25.518
And find a government rep
and tell them who you are.

17:25.552 --> 17:26.554
Sam...

17:26.587 --> 17:28.691
Look, I get it.
It's complicated.

17:28.724 --> 17:32.164
But who gives a shit?
You'd have food and water.

17:32.197 --> 17:34.135
I'm sorry.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.609

17:37.642 --> 17:39.613
You like me
halfway sober, right?

17:39.646 --> 17:42.652
20 minutes with my mom,
and I promise you I won't be.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.660
When have you ever
been halfway sober?

17:46.694 --> 17:50.935
I'm gonna go track down a,
um, camping stove.

17:52.539 --> 17:55.645

There's a militia group

20:25.043 --> 20:26.747
occupying
the Arizona statehouse.

20:26.780 --> 20:29.185
‐12 hostages.
‐Three state reps

20:29.218 --> 20:30.855

21:12.070 --> 21:13.674
There's a team scheduled

21:13.707 --> 21:15.177

There's 80,000 New Yorkers
left on the island.

21:17.347 --> 21:19.351
And priceless genetic material
in that building.

21:22.759 --> 21:25.197
My father thought of me
as an advisor;

21:25.230 --> 21:27.067
he always wanted me to
share my opinion freely.

We're not even sure if any of
that material is still viable.

21:29.840 --> 21:32.779

let the backup generators die.
