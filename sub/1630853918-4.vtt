to solve our Melvin problem.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.377
You can't think and be friendly
at the same time?

11:50.460 --> 11:53.422
-I didn't know this was a date.
-You're lucky it's not a date.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.716
By now I would have gone to the bathroom,
snuck out the window,

11:56.800 --> 12:00.137
and left you alone
in a duckpin bowling alley for five hours

12:00.220 --> 12:01.972
doing God knows what.

12:03.014 --> 12:07.561
I actually did that to a guy, and I have
no idea what he did after I left.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.771
What exactly are you looking for here?

12:09.855 --> 12:13.775
'Cause I never compared pubes with
the girls in my Brownie troop, okay?

12:13.859 --> 12:15.152
That's not normal.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.987
Human connection!

12:17.529 --> 12:20.782
I mean, with you living here, I thought
maybe finally I'd have a gal pal.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.119
But clearly you're not interested
in being pals with this gal.

12:25.537 --> 12:26.413
Uh...

12:28.665 --> 12:30.709
[wind blowing]

12:30.792 --> 12:33.128
[Melvin] It's like when you're at the
airport and you forget to bring snacks.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.255
And now you gotta buy it
from a store in the terminal,

12:35.338 --> 12:37.591
but they jack the shit up
like three times the price.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.260
That's when I realized that this stuff
that people really needed--

12:40.343 --> 12:42.679
-Someone just open a can of tennis balls?
-Nah, that's me.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.515
If it's something people really needed,
like toilet paper,

12:45.599 --> 12:46.641
I could charge them for it.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.561
-Supply and demand.
-Ooh, I like that.

12:49.644 --> 12:53.648
"Supplyin' the man," 'cause I'm supplyin'
the man with the things he needs.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.775
-Wow.
-Oh, but women buy stuff, too,

12:55.859 --> 12:57.027
so I don't know if that works.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.237
Hey, Rooster, you remember J.J.'s Wings?

12:59.321 --> 13:01.531
He was too stupid
to work the cash register,

13:01.615 --> 13:03.700
so they put him outside in a chicken suit
holding the sign.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.286
-What'd it say?
-"Honk if you give a cluck."

13:06.369 --> 13:08.497
Well, I'm surprised
he didn't screw that up, too.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.581
Right?

13:10.040 --> 13:12.834
Oh, did you hear that?
Am I thinking really loud?

13:12.918 --> 13:14.544
I guess so, but you're right.

13:14.628 --> 13:17.547
This dude so dumb, he once stared at
an orange juice carton for 20 minutes

13:17.631 --> 13:19.299
because it said "concentrate."

13:19.382 --> 13:20.258
No, I didn't!

13:20.342 --> 13:23.220
He's so stupid, he thought Tupac Shakur
was a Jewish holiday.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.806
I know Tupac ain't no holiday!

13:26.890 --> 13:29.476
And stop laughing, man.
Handle your weed!

13:29.559 --> 13:31.853
I'm sorry. The guy's funny.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.438
Did you make up all these jokes, Melvin?

13:33.522 --> 13:37.108
Nah, man. My uncle gave me an insult
joke book for my fifth birthday.

13:37.192 --> 13:38.777
I used to go ham on my grandma.

13:38.860 --> 13:41.196
And you still remember them
like twenty-some years later?

13:41.279 --> 13:42.447
That's an impressive skill, Melvin.

13:42.531 --> 13:44.074
I guess I'm a good remembererer.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.578
-Wait. What was I sayin'?
-"Supplyin' the man."

13:48.662 --> 13:50.497
Oh yeah! Make a left.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.333
When I see a need in the marketplace,
I fill it.

13:53.416 --> 13:56.002
Lately, I've been hearing that
with people stuck at home,

13:56.086 --> 13:58.380
they've been pickin' up new hobbies.
Make a right.

13:58.463 --> 14:02.384
Makin' things with paint,
makin' bread with bread juice.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.469
Makin' songs with instruments.

14:05.887 --> 14:08.014
So, I went online, and sure enough,

14:08.098 --> 14:10.976
the prices for musical instruments
are through the roof!

14:11.059 --> 14:12.394
That's when I realized

14:12.477 --> 14:16.022
I know an abandoned building in town
with a whole room full of instruments.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.863
-You wanna rob a school?
-It's empty 'cause of COVID.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.366
All we gotta do is park around back
and pick one lock.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.660
-They don't have cameras in that thing?
-Nah.

14:28.743 --> 14:31.037
And if you didn't get kicked out of
the ninth grade, you'd know that.

14:31.121 --> 14:32.914
I didn't get kicked out.

14:32.998 --> 14:35.083
All right? I got a B- on a science quiz.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.043
I decided to go out on top.
My choice.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.920
I bet if we hurry,
we could get done in an hour.

14:39.004 --> 14:41.298
-Wait. You wanna do this right now?
-Yeah. Why not?

14:41.381 --> 14:43.049
Because it's in the middle of the day...

14:43.133 --> 14:44.259
and we're high.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.511
I'm not tryin' to go back to prison.

14:46.595 --> 14:49.055
Besides, I don't wanna rob a school.
Especially not this one.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.640
The principal seemed like
a really nice guy.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.520
I was here a few days ago
for a job interview.

14:55.604 --> 14:56.479
Why?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.982
Because I got a degree in prison,
and I was hoping that I--

14:59.065 --> 15:02.152
I don't-- it doesn't matter. Can't you
think of someone else for us to rob?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.696
I told you, man. He only robs bad people.
It's annoying.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.408
It sounds to me like the principal was
an asshole. He didn't give you the job.

15:08.491 --> 15:11.161
Nah. It wasn't his fault. The school
system won't hire an ex-con.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.662
That's even worse!

15:12.746 --> 15:14.706
How do they expect you to make
something out of yourself

15:14.789 --> 15:16.541
if they're not willing to
give you a chance.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.960
The whole point is to rehabilitate.

15:19.044 --> 15:22.339
Bullshit like that is the reason
this system is a revolving door.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.717
Yeah. You're right. That's actually--

15:25.800 --> 15:27.761
That's actually really well-said, Melvin.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.180
Thanks. I am good with words.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.264
I should've been on that team

15:31.348 --> 15:33.391
that challenges other schools
to talk about shit.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.352
-Debate?
-Nah, I don't wanna debate it.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.728
I'm just saying I'm good at it.

15:37.187 --> 15:38.938
You don't have to feel bad about
stealing from them.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.565
They're treating you
like a criminal anyway.

15:40.649 --> 15:43.151
But you're probably right about
not doin' this during the day.

15:43.234 --> 15:46.780
We got a bit of time to kill.
You boys like baseball?

15:46.863 --> 15:47.947
Heh.

15:52.827 --> 15:56.623
I'm sorry. You've been very nice
letting me stay here.

15:56.706 --> 16:00.043
I would love to... be your gal pal.

16:02.003 --> 16:04.214
Sit down. I'll make us some wine.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.091
Did you say "make"?

16:06.174 --> 16:08.551
It's from a box,
but I like to doctor it up

16:08.635 --> 16:11.221
based on the time of day and season.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.974
So... let's start gal-palin'.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.685
Tell me how you ended up in jail.

16:16.768 --> 16:19.688
And take it way back.
Pretend I'm Oprah.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.649
Fine. When I was little,

16:22.732 --> 16:25.735
I realized some people had
a lot more money than others.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.237
Then, a few years later,

16:27.320 --> 16:30.740
when the cash from my fast-food job
wasn't adding up fast enough,

16:30.824 --> 16:32.992
I had this great idea
on how to make more money

16:33.076 --> 16:35.954
by hollowing out all my old books.

16:36.037 --> 16:39.916
I listed them online as a great place
to hide your valuables.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.794
Of course, anyone who bought one
would give me their address.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.337
And that was the key to the whole thing,

16:44.421 --> 16:49.050
because, after that, all I had to do was
remember where I sent what book,

16:49.134 --> 16:52.387
hide for a little while, and then wait
for the right time to sneak in.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.265
It was actually
a pretty clever first scam.

16:55.348 --> 16:59.018
And when it worked, it felt amazing.

16:59.102 --> 17:02.147
I went to college, but I only took courses

17:02.230 --> 17:04.274
that helped me become a better con woman.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.819
Psychology, accounting, computers...

17:07.902 --> 17:10.613
Eventually I dropped out,
hopped from city to city,

17:10.697 --> 17:13.616
making friends with rich people and then
disappearing with their money.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.951
That's amazing!

17:16.911 --> 17:21.708
So, how does a partially college-educated
con artist eventually get caught?

17:23.126 --> 17:24.919
-Mayonnaise.
-Come again?

17:31.885 --> 17:34.679
I told the guy not to
put mayonnaise on my sub,

17:34.763 --> 17:37.640
but when I took the first bite,
it was 75% mayonnaise.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.727
And, to be fair, he started it.

17:41.603 --> 17:44.898
Anyway, one thing led to another.
Things got ugly.

17:47.859 --> 17:52.405
[sighs] Yeah. The video went viral,
and someone I scammed recognized me.

17:53.198 --> 17:54.616
I got six years...

17:55.325 --> 17:57.702
but only had to serve three,
thanks to COVID.

17:57.786 --> 17:58.870
Wow!

17:58.953 --> 18:03.082
I wouldn't have spent a day in jail
if it wasn't for this one stupid mistake.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.338
Hey. We all make mistakes.

18:08.922 --> 18:15.303
And the internet is full of viral videos
that are way worse than yours.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.725
[intrigue music playing]

18:26.523 --> 18:27.857
Barb, what is this?

18:40.370 --> 18:41.663
Oh, this is disgusting!

18:41.746 --> 18:43.915
Barb, Barb! Why would you show me this?!

18:48.253 --> 18:49.254
That was you?

18:49.337 --> 18:52.382
The guy who lived there
never cleans up after his dog.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.094
Oh. [chuckles]

18:56.177 --> 18:58.388
Now that I know the backstory,
that's kind of funny.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.306
-Wanna see it again?
-I do not.

19:03.977 --> 19:06.938
Yep. Right there is good.
You'll have a great view.

19:08.106 --> 19:11.401
Whoa! Check it out!
How cool is this?

19:11.484 --> 19:13.528
It's like a tissue forest.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.446
That's a lot of toilet paper, Melvin.

19:15.530 --> 19:17.240
Yeah. I recently doubled the prices.

19:17.323 --> 19:20.159
It take a little while for
the neighborhood to adjust to inflation.

19:20.243 --> 19:23.496
But there are two certainties
in life, Jack-- death and shitting.

19:25.498 --> 19:29.335
You're gonna love this game.
No spoilers, but in the sixth inning...

19:29.419 --> 19:32.630
You know what? Just watch it.
You're gonna love it.

19:33.715 --> 19:35.800
[funky music playing]

19:38.428 --> 19:39.304
Yes!

19:46.352 --> 19:47.770
Ahh.

19:48.730 --> 19:51.649
Shit! Come on, man!

19:54.944 --> 19:58.031
Hey, what's, uh...
what's goin' on with your boyfriend?

19:58.114 --> 20:00.700
He likes to pretend he's playing again
like when he was little.

20:00.783 --> 20:04.287
It's fun. I tried one time with my old
gymnastics competitions,

20:04.370 --> 20:07.373
but my dad only recorded the other girls
for some reason.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.630
-So, Melvin, that's you pitching?
-Yeah.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.299
All-state till I threw out my shoulder
in junior high.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.759
Throwing too hard?

20:17.842 --> 20:19.385
Nah, I just slept on it funny.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.262
I played some ball when I was younger.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.848
This is a really cool idea, Melvin.

20:23.932 --> 20:25.975
Thanks. Take third base.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.227
-Really?
-Yeah.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.146
You look like you can handle
the high corner.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.148
I got an extra glove in my room.

20:33.191 --> 20:35.068
[funky music playing]

20:43.576 --> 20:45.536
-Can I play?
-No. You're too short.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.622
Taller than the kid playin' second.

20:47.705 --> 20:50.792
[scoffs] Probably would've jumped up
and caught that last one.

20:50.875 --> 20:54.379
I said no. Just sit in the stands.
You can try to get an autograph later.

20:55.129 --> 20:57.090
-Look alive. This one is comin' to you.
-Hup.

21:04.722 --> 21:07.517
Nice snag!
And you throw a rope to first base!

21:07.600 --> 21:09.435
Thanks, Melvin. I feel like I would have.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.854
Pfft. You throw like a girl.

21:13.523 --> 21:16.651
Oh, oh. Uh-oh. Foul ball!

21:18.695 --> 21:20.363
You gotta keep your eyes peeled, man.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.115
I don't need this shit.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.784
Y'all just keep laughin' at me,
callin' me dumb, and won't let me play.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.869
And now I got nacho cheese on me!

21:26.953 --> 21:29.622
I'm gonna be hot and wet for a while,
and then I'm gonna be cold and soggy.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.332
And then after that,
I'm gonna be all crusty!

21:31.416 --> 21:33.918
-You can go to hell.
-Oh well. You know what? Good.

21:34.002 --> 21:36.337
You'd probably end up leaving
a picture of your dick laying around

21:36.421 --> 21:38.006
for the cops to find anyway.

21:38.089 --> 21:40.174
Pfft. No doubt.

21:40.258 --> 21:42.135
All right, we're up. You lead off.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.440
[grunts]

21:59.318 --> 22:01.946
-[screams]
-[laughing]

22:02.030 --> 22:03.865
-[Stan] Somethin' funny?
-[clears throat]

22:06.117 --> 22:07.368
Hello, Stan.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.996
Just bringin' dinner to Mama.
Pot stickers.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.789
It's killing her
she can't get down to Wang's

22:11.873 --> 22:13.750
and get 'em hot and crispy
right out of the fryer.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.085
But COVID, right?
What are you gonna do?

22:16.169 --> 22:18.379
-You good?
-Peachy.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.260
Shouldn't you get those stickers to mom
while they're still warm-ish.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.514
Yeah. Yeah, good idea.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.227
Who was that?

22:33.311 --> 22:35.688
Stan. He grew up next door.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.815
When we were little, we used to play

22:37.899 --> 22:39.484
"Show me yours; I'll show you mine."

22:39.567 --> 22:42.361
He liked mine a lot more than I liked his.

22:42.445 --> 22:45.782
Then, in high school,
I discovered strawberry wine.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.533
Made the mistake of sleeping with him.

22:47.617 --> 22:49.327
Then again before I got married.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.329
Then twice after my husband died.

22:51.412 --> 22:56.042
-Now he won't leave me alone.
-Aww. He likes you. That's nice.

22:56.125 --> 22:59.837
Nice? Yuck. No thank you.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.882
Mama needs a little excitement
in the sack.

23:03.591 --> 23:06.260
Speaking of that, what's goin' on
with you and Jack?

23:06.886 --> 23:09.514
Rooster told me you guys
had a thing in prison.

23:09.597 --> 23:13.309
Well, we just used to talk to each other
through the toilet. That's all.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.978
And turns out, he was lying
the whole time, so...

23:16.062 --> 23:18.815
So? So what?
Men lie all the time.

23:18.898 --> 23:22.360
Stan already got his mother pot stickers
an hour ago.

23:22.443 --> 23:23.861
I saw them through the kitchen window.

23:24.529 --> 23:26.030
Why are you back?

23:26.114 --> 23:28.616
Because the first time I came by,
Barb wasn't on her porch.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.368
Just put them in the freezer.

23:30.451 --> 23:33.412
All I'm saying is
you've been locked up for three years.

23:33.496 --> 23:36.207
I know you're itchin' to get laid.

23:36.290 --> 23:38.459
Maybe it's time to scratch that itch.

23:38.543 --> 23:41.587
Look, if I thought it could just be sex,
I might treat myself.

23:41.671 --> 23:45.925
But you think we're desperate?
Jack's been locked up for 26 years.

23:46.592 --> 23:49.011
The other day, our knees touched,
and I thought he was gonna explode.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.556
Trust me. If I feed him,
you're not gonna be the only one

23:51.639 --> 23:53.683
having a stray cat following you around.

23:53.766 --> 23:58.521
That reminds me. Halloween 2012.
I went as Catwoman.

23:59.313 --> 24:01.357
Slept with Stan that night, too.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.485
Mom wants dessert, so don't be surprised

24:04.569 --> 24:06.279
if you see me again in a few minutes.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.199
It takes a special type of man

24:10.283 --> 24:13.035
to make me dislike my own damn porch.

24:16.747 --> 24:20.209
Hey, Melvin, I dropped that wooden flute
back there. Would you grab it?

24:21.169 --> 24:23.671
Hey, what's the deal with
that hot chick in y'all crew?

24:23.754 --> 24:25.173
You tappin' that shit?

24:25.965 --> 24:29.677
Oh, Gloria? No, we have not... tapped.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.929
We talked some in prison, but...

24:32.597 --> 24:35.183
Since we've been out, I'm kinda realizing
that she's a little out of my league.

24:35.266 --> 24:37.810
Any man can get any woman
if he pushes the right buttons.

24:43.316 --> 24:46.777
What exactly did you mean when you said,
"push the right buttons," Melvin?

24:46.861 --> 24:50.656
Oh, shit. Lookin' to get a little
schoolin' from the master, huh?

24:50.740 --> 24:54.160
Well, yeah. I don't know.
Yeah. I mean maybe.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.871
Wiggles is really cute.
I'm impressed, Melvin.

24:57.788 --> 25:01.876
And I'd love to know how you managed
to persuade her to be... tapped.

25:02.585 --> 25:03.961
Human psychology.

25:04.962 --> 25:07.381
When Wiggles was a kid,
she didn't have much physical affection.

25:07.465 --> 25:09.008
So, I got her one of those heavy blankets

25:09.091 --> 25:11.177
so every night she feels like
she's being snuggled.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.763
Plus, she can't get from up under it
without me,

25:13.846 --> 25:16.015
so every morning I'm a hero.

25:16.474 --> 25:19.227
-That's really smart, Melvin.
-I know, right?

-This is Rooster's dinky-ass knife!
-Son of a bitch!

25:37.161 --> 25:39.747
Must've followed us to the school
and done this while we was inside.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.332
Why would he leave his knife
in the tire, though?

25:41.415 --> 25:43.209
He's gotta know we're gonna
beat the shit out of him.

25:43.292 --> 25:44.835

25:44.919 --> 25:47.171

-Oh, no.

25:47.255 --> 25:49.298
Shit, man! Her set us up
and wanted us to know it!

25:49.382 --> 25:51.342
No, no, no, no, no.
This can't be happening!

25:51.425 --> 25:54.387
I can't go back!
I didn't even wanna do this, man!

25:54.470 --> 25:56.847
I did 26 years!
I'm not supposed to go--

25:56.931 --> 25:58.641
-I can't do this!
-Just go.

25:58.724 --> 25:59.850
What?

25:59.934 --> 26:02.812
Even if I ran, they're gonna trace
this truck back to me.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.231
You can get away. Ain't no need
for us both to get pinched.

26:06.399 --> 26:07.817
Are you for real?

26:07.900 --> 26:08.943
Yeah.

26:09.527 --> 26:12.905
You're a good dude, man.
And a solid third baseman.

26:14.031 --> 26:16.867
Just promise me when you see Rooster,
you beat the shit out of him.

26:16.951 --> 26:19.036
Not a problem.
Melvin, I don't know how to thank you.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.246
Just go!

26:27.837 --> 26:31.090
All right, calm down.
Nothing here but some stolen instruments

26:31.173 --> 26:33.217
and a very relaxed brother on weed.

26:38.806 --> 26:40.683
-Ooh.
-Hey. Did it work?

26:40.766 --> 26:42.435
-Like a charm.
-Did what work?

26:42.518 --> 26:44.520
Rooster said you were
robbing the school with Melvin.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.730
-You didn't tell her?
-Nah.

26:45.813 --> 26:47.273
I was afraid she'd stop making donuts.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.025
What's going on?

26:50.443 --> 26:53.863
Well, I told you I used to
read a lot in prison, right?

26:56.991 --> 26:59.910
A few years ago, I read a book
by a guy named Dale Carnegie.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.788
I thought it might help me make friends
after I got released.

27:03.414 --> 27:06.625
In it he breaks down the basic principles
of getting someone to like you.

27:07.168 --> 27:09.670
First, use the person's name a lot,

27:09.754 --> 27:11.589
because the person's name, to that person,

27:11.672 --> 27:13.424
is the most beautiful word
in any language.

27:13.507 --> 27:18.888
Melvin, Melvin, Melvin...

27:18.971 --> 27:22.475
Secondly, ask people about themselves
and pretend to care.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.727
So, Melvin, that's you pitching?

27:24.810 --> 27:27.313
Wiggles is really cute.
I'm impressed, Melvin.

27:27.396 --> 27:30.983
And I'd love to know how you managed
to persuade her to be... tapped.

27:31.067 --> 27:33.402
Third, make other people feel important.

27:33.486 --> 27:35.654
Yeah. You're right. That's actually--

27:35.738 --> 27:37.823
That's actually really well-said, Melvin.

27:37.907 --> 27:38.783
Thanks.

27:38.866 --> 27:40.951
And you still remember them
like twenty-some years later?

27:41.035 --> 27:42.578
Guess I'm a good remembererer.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.121
Lastly, smile.

27:47.333 --> 27:50.628
Before I knew it, Melvin started to
see me as a team mate.

27:50.711 --> 27:53.297
But then I needed to let
my real team mate in on the plan.

27:55.341 --> 27:58.552
Oh, that's genius! I thought
you were losin' your mind.

27:58.636 --> 28:00.930
Hopefully it all works out.
Give me your knife.

28:02.139 --> 28:04.141
We just have to figure out a way
for you to get pissed off enough

28:04.225 --> 28:05.142
to storm out of here.

28:09.647 --> 28:11.315
I think I have an idea.

28:11.399 --> 28:14.985
-Foul ball!
-[Jack and Melvin laughing]

28:16.362 --> 28:19.031

back there. Would you grab it?

28:19.740 --> 28:22.159
[Melvin] Hey, what's the deal with
that hot chick in y'all crew?

28:22.243 --> 28:23.661
You tappin' that shit?

28:25.538 --> 28:28.749
Oh, Gloria? No, we have not... tapped.

28:28.833 --> 28:31.293
When did Jack say
he and Melvin would be back?

28:32.711 --> 28:34.713
Shouldn't be too much longer.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.473
Hi. Yes. I'd like to report
a break-in at the school.

28:44.557 --> 28:47.184
I saw a dark blue truck
driving north on Center Street.

28:48.018 --> 28:50.104
And when the cops were on their way,

28:50.187 --> 28:52.356
Melvin actually volunteered
to take the hit.

28:53.566 --> 28:56.777
See? Y'all were mad at me, but...

28:56.861 --> 28:58.946
everything worked out just fine.

29:01.991 --> 29:04.535
Melvin also made me promise
to beat the shit out of Rooster.

29:04.618 --> 29:05.870
Maybe you should.

29:05.953 --> 29:09.081
We wouldn't be in this mess if he didn't
screw up in the first place.

29:10.374 --> 29:11.834
