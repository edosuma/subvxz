11:45.663 --> 11:47.123
- THAT'S WHY
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.749
- DID SHE SAY ANYTHING ELSE?

11:48.833 --> 11:51.544
- SHE SAID THIS RULER
MAY BE FORGOTTEN,

11:51.627 --> 11:54.463
BUT SHE WILL NOT BE IGNORED.

11:54.547 --> 11:59.051
- SOUNDS LIKE A SPIRIT
WITH SELF-ESTEEM ISSUES.

11:59.135 --> 12:02.513
- SO WHAT'S THE LATEST
WITH THE CLUE, FABIAN?

12:02.596 --> 12:03.889
- IT'S PRETTY OBSCURE.

12:03.973 --> 12:07.309
- "UPON THE FOUNDATION
ON WHICH THIS HOUSE RESTS

12:07.393 --> 12:09.812
"LIES THE SOLUTION
TO THE SPIDER WEB TEST.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.022
"TO FIND THE ARMORER
AND SCHOLAR'S HOLLOW,

12:12.106 --> 12:14.483
THE SILVER THREAD
OF FATE YOU MUST FOLLOW."

12:14.567 --> 12:17.319
- ARMORER AND SCHOLAR'S HOLLOW.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.572
- THE LIBRARY.

12:19.655 --> 12:20.781
- HOW DID YOU FIGURE
THAT ONE OUT?

12:20.865 --> 12:22.408
- THAT'S WHERE THE SUIT
OF ARMOR USED TO BE.

12:22.491 --> 12:25.161
ARMOR,
ARMORER, RIGHT?

12:25.244 --> 12:26.579
AND I DON'T KNOW,
ISN'T SCHOLAR,

12:26.662 --> 12:29.039
LIKE, AN OLD STYLE WORD
FOR MASSIVE NERD?

12:29.123 --> 12:31.167
- AND WHERE DO YOU FIND THAT?

12:31.250 --> 12:32.585
- SO I SPEND A LOT
OF TIME IN THE LIBRARY.

12:32.668 --> 12:36.881
THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M
A MASSIVE NERD, OKAY?

12:36.964 --> 12:38.007
- OKAY.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.842
SO FABIAN AND I
WILL RESEARCH ONLINE

12:39.925 --> 12:42.678
WHILE YOU TWO GO CHECK OUT
THE LIBRARY.

12:42.761 --> 12:43.679
OKAY?

12:43.762 --> 12:44.763
- MM-HMM.

12:44.847 --> 12:45.931
[bell ringing]

12:56.942 --> 12:58.068
- MR. SWEET.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.862
- JEROME, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO INFORM ME

12:59.945 --> 13:01.197
OF ANYMORE GOOSE-RELATED
HIJINKS, ARE YOU?

13:01.280 --> 13:03.199
- NO, NO.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.283
THE GOOSE HAS BEEN RETURNED.

13:04.366 --> 13:05.201
WE ARE OFFICIALLY GOOSE-FREE.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.494
- I'M VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

13:06.577 --> 13:08.287
- THERE IS ONE THING.

13:08.370 --> 13:11.373
I WAS THINKING THE OTHER DAY
ABOUT HOW GREAT OUR SCHOOL IS--

13:11.457 --> 13:12.958
IT'S FINE HISTORICAL LINEAGE--

13:13.042 --> 13:16.253
AND HAPPENED TO LOOK
IN THE AWARDS CABINET.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.881
- AH, YES.

13:20.591 --> 13:22.468
YES, UH, IT IS RATHER BARE.

13:22.551 --> 13:23.928
- AND WHY IS THAT?

13:24.011 --> 13:25.554
I MEAN, THERE SEEMS
TO BE A MASSIVE SPACE

13:25.638 --> 13:27.056
RESERVED FOR SOME SHIELD.

13:27.139 --> 13:30.684
- IT'S ALL SINCE WE LOST
THE FROBISHER SHIELD, YES.

13:30.768 --> 13:31.894
- GO ON.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.939
- THE MOST SOUGHT-AFTER
SPORTING TROPHY,

13:35.022 --> 13:36.941
UNTIL A GEM WAS STOLEN
FROM IT.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.234
WE LOST IT THAT YEAR,

13:38.317 --> 13:39.527
AND WE NEVER MANAGED
TO WIN IT BACK AGAIN.

13:39.610 --> 13:43.030
AND OUR SPORTING LUCK SEEMED
TO EVAPORATE THAT DAY,

13:43.113 --> 13:44.198
AND IT HAS NEVER RETURNED.

13:44.281 --> 13:49.245
AND THE SCHOOL SLIPPED
INTO, WELL, DESPAIR.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.329
- 30 YEARS OF BAD LUCK.

13:50.412 --> 13:51.497
- WHAT?

13:51.580 --> 13:56.752
OH, YES, MY WORD, IT HAS BEEN
ABOUT 30 YEARS.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.590
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN,
JEROME,

14:01.674 --> 14:04.176
BUT THIS SORT OF THING HAPPENS,

14:04.260 --> 14:08.722
AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
ABOUT IT.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.316
- WATCH OUT.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.985
- UH, GET LOST, WEASEL.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.653
- OKAY, YOU CAN
DEFINITELY SEE NOW.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.947
- YEP, AND YOU CAN BACK OFF.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.740
- HEY, AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
IN DETENTION,

14:26.824 --> 14:28.158
I MEAN, YOU NEED LOOKING AFTER.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.451
YOU ALMOST KISSED ME.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.828
CLOSE CALL, RIGHT?

14:30.911 --> 14:32.830
- UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:32.913 --> 14:33.664
AND I WAS HALF BLIND,

14:33.747 --> 14:35.332
SO IT DOESN'T EVEN COUNT.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.792
- WELL, YOU KNOW,

14:36.875 --> 14:38.043
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE
ANOTHER RUN AT IT,

14:38.127 --> 14:38.460
I'M HERE.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.254
ANYTIME.

14:40.337 --> 14:41.005
- OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.923
YOU MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS,

14:43.007 --> 14:44.300
TELL ME WHERE YOU'LL BE,

14:44.383 --> 14:45.718
AND I'LL MAKE SURE I'M
ON THE OTHER SIDE

14:45.801 --> 14:47.136
OF THE PLANET, OKAY?

14:47.219 --> 14:51.640
- LOOK, PATRICIA...

14:51.724 --> 14:53.934
I'VE LOWERED MY FORCE FIELD.

14:54.018 --> 14:54.977
SHOOP.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.396
[chortles]

14:57.479 --> 14:59.940
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS DROP THE ACT AND LOWER YOURS.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.320
- JUST GROW UP
AND LEAVE ME ALONE.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.822
- FINE, THEN.

15:06.905 --> 15:08.324
SHOOP.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.576
SMELL YOU LATER.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.079
- TCH.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.962
- COME ON IN.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.591
TAKE A SEAT, PLEASE.

15:27.801 --> 15:31.180
SO HOW CAN I BE OF ASSISTANCE?

15:32.806 --> 15:36.101
- IT'S ABOUT VERA.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.394
- I SEE.

15:37.478 --> 15:38.771
UH, WELL, I'D LOVE
TO HELP YOU,

15:38.854 --> 15:41.231
BUT I BARELY KNOW HER.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.484
- I HEARD IT WAS YOU
THAT RECOMMENDED HER

15:43.567 --> 15:45.027
FOR THE JOB AT ANUBIS HOUSE.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.987
- LIKE I SAID,

15:47.071 --> 15:50.282
I BARELY KNOW HER AT ALL.

15:50.366 --> 15:54.119
AND ACTUALLY I'M ALREADY RUNNING
LATE FOR ANOTHER APPOINTMENT,

15:54.203 --> 15:57.206
SO, UM...

15:57.289 --> 15:59.541
SORRY.

16:02.961 --> 16:05.839
- JASPER A DEAD END.

16:05.923 --> 16:10.302
NEXT STEP, INVESTIGATE
VERA'S PAST EMPLOYERS.

16:11.553 --> 16:14.223
- I MEAN, THE ARROGANCE.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.433
YOU HAVE TO ASK PERMISSION FOR
THAT SORT OF THING, DON'T YOU?

16:16.517 --> 16:18.143
OH, BUT NOT HIM.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.688
I HAVE NEVER MET ANYONE SO...

16:20.771 --> 16:22.231
[scoffs]

16:22.314 --> 16:23.691
- WOW.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.275
- YOU'VE GOT IT BAD.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.860
- JOY...

16:26.944 --> 16:27.861
WHAT?

16:27.945 --> 16:29.238
- YEP.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.407
- [scoffs]

16:31.490 --> 16:32.741
DID I OVERPLAY IT?

16:32.825 --> 16:35.077
- ONLY TO SOMEONE WHO KNOWS YOU
LIKE I DO.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.746
TO EVERYONE ELSE
IT LOOKS LIKE PURE HATRED.

16:37.830 --> 16:38.747
- UH, WELL, YEAH,
THAT'S THE GENERAL VIBE

16:38.831 --> 16:41.750
I'M TRYING TO GO FOR.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.377
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO SEE THROUGH IT.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.920
- WELL, IT'S WORKING.

16:45.003 --> 16:46.922
SERIOUSLY,
TELL HIM YOU LIKE HIM,

16:47.005 --> 16:48.549
OTHERWISE HE'S JUST GOING
TO LOSE INTEREST.

16:48.632 --> 16:49.758
- I CAN'T.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.636
I MEAN, I WANT TO SAY,

16:52.720 --> 16:55.514
"EDDIE, I LIKE YOU,

16:55.597 --> 16:56.807
I THINK YOU'RE CUTE,"
AND ALL THAT STUFF.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.434
BY THE TIME IT GETS TO HERE,

16:58.517 --> 17:00.894
IT COMES OUT AS, "GET OUT
OF MY FACE, EDDIE, YOU FREAK."

17:00.978 --> 17:04.147
- YEAH, YOU SAY THAT A LOT.

17:04.231 --> 17:07.526
- I KNOW.

17:07.608 --> 17:09.444
I LIKE HIM.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.320
LIKE, I REALLY DO.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.157
BUT I CAN'T HANDLE IT
WHEN HE'S NICE TO ME.

17:14.241 --> 17:16.910
IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE SUCH A HORRIBLE PERSON.

17:16.993 --> 17:18.412
- YOU'RE NOT A HORRIBLE PERSON.

17:18.494 --> 17:19.579
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

17:19.663 --> 17:22.624
- YOU NEED TO TELL HIM.

17:24.917 --> 17:25.627
[knocking on door]

17:25.711 --> 17:29.757
[door clicks]

17:31.800 --> 17:33.844
- VERA?

17:33.927 --> 17:37.014
ARE YOU THERE?

17:47.274 --> 17:49.818
ONLINE SEARCH FOR VERA
GOT ME NOWHERE.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.279
IT'S LIKE SHE DOESN'T EXIST.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.198
A COMPLETE GHOST.

17:57.409 --> 18:01.955
THIS CALLS FOR A MORE EXTREME
COURSE OF ACTION.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.355
"BLAKE MANOR.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.232
MILKWICH FOR ARKDALE."

18:28.315 --> 18:31.819
SAME NAME,
DIFFERENT ADDRESSES.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.161
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE,
MARA?

18:41.245 --> 18:43.205
- JUST LOOKING FOR YOU, VERA.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.373
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.416
THAT'S A RELIEF.

18:53.173 --> 18:56.051
- IF I EVER FIND YOU
OR ANYONE ELSE

18:56.134 --> 18:57.386
SNOOPING AROUND UP HERE AGAIN

18:57.469 --> 19:00.514
OR PUTTING ONE THIEVING
LITTLE FINGER ON MY THINGS,

19:00.597 --> 19:03.684
WELL...

19:03.767 --> 19:06.103
WORDS CANNOT EVEN BEGIN
TO DESCRIBE

19:06.186 --> 19:09.815
HOW UNPLEASANT I CAN BE.

19:09.898 --> 19:11.233
IS THAT CLEAR?

19:11.316 --> 19:14.319
- CRYSTAL.

19:14.403 --> 19:17.906
- RUN ALONG, THEN, DEAR.

19:24.872 --> 19:25.581
- HEY, MARA.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.332
- WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.920
[breathy whooshing]

19:36.717 --> 19:37.926
- SO ANY LUCK?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.261
- WE CHECKED THE LIBRARY.

19:39.344 --> 19:43.849
NO ARMOR, HOLLOWS,
OR SILVER THREADS OF FATE.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.518
JUST YOUR NORMAL NERD HERD
OF DORKS WITH BOOKS.

19:46.602 --> 19:47.978
- WAIT.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.230
WAIT, I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.357
THIS IS ALL ABOUT LAST NAMES
AND WHAT THEY MEAN.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.067
SO I THOUGHT I'D LOOK UP
"FROBISHER,"

19:54.151 --> 19:56.069
WHICH COMES FROM
AN OLD FRENCH WORD

19:56.153 --> 19:57.946
FOR <i> BISSEOR,</i>
WHICH MEANS "TO SHINE."

19:58.030 --> 19:59.865
- FASCINATING.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.283
AND HE SAYS HE'S NOT A NERD.

20:01.366 --> 20:05.954
- WELL--WHICH IS A LAST NAME
MOST COMMONLY GIVEN TO ARMORERS.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.831
- OKAY, NOW, THAT IS ACTUALLY
PRETTY INTERESTING.

20:07.915 --> 20:10.334
- WHAT--THANK YOU.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.835
LOOK, SO WHAT IF I AM A NERD?

20:11.919 --> 20:13.128
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT.

20:13.211 --> 20:17.007
IT WAS NERDS LIKE ME
THAT INVENTED THE WHEEL, EMAIL,

20:17.090 --> 20:19.009
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING
YOU COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.053
- I FEEL YOUR PAIN,
MY FRIEND.

20:21.136 --> 20:23.221
I GET HASSLED 'CAUSE I WANT
TO BE A NINJA.

20:25.557 --> 20:30.020
- SO THE RIDDLE'S ABOUT
THE FROBISHER-SMYTHES?

20:30.103 --> 20:31.647
- WELL, HE WAS A SMART SCHOLAR,
WASN'T HE?

20:31.730 --> 20:33.482
- YEAH, AND FOUNDATIONS
COULD MEAN FOUNDERS.

20:33.565 --> 20:34.149
AND WHO BUILT THIS PLACE?

20:34.232 --> 20:36.777
- THE FROBISHER-SMYTHES.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.820
THE PICTURE OF THEM
IN THE DINING ROOM.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.323
MAYBE THE SOLUTION
TO THE TASK IS BEHIND IT.

20:41.406 --> 20:44.576
- WAIT, WAIT.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.370
- WALK,
DON'T RUN.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.746
all: SORRY, VICTOR.

20:47.829 --> 20:50.832
- TSK, TSK, TSK.

21:05.722 --> 21:08.392
CHAPTER 13.

21:08.475 --> 21:12.604
THE MASK OF ANUBIS.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.440
THE MASK OF ANUBIS.

21:24.157 --> 21:26.118
[knocking]

21:26.201 --> 21:27.869
- IT'S DEFINITELY HOLLOW.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.663
- I WONDER WHAT THIS DOES.

21:29.746 --> 21:30.956
- IT'S A PICTURE WIRE.

21:31.039 --> 21:35.252
- OR THE SILVER THREAD OF FATE?

21:36.545 --> 21:38.714
- THEN LET'S FOLLOW IT.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.925
- DO IT, ALFIE.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.469
[rumbling and squeaking]

21:47.431 --> 21:48.348
- WHAT IS THAT?

21:50.976 --> 21:53.895
[clacking]

21:55.147 --> 21:56.606
[cranking]

21:56.690 --> 22:00.152
[rumbling and creaking]

22:03.488 --> 22:04.364
clang!
