- You got mail, Dad.
- More mail?

00:02.894 --> 00:04.094
Man, it's like it
comes every day here.

00:04.129 --> 00:06.329
Zephyria's on a raven system,
so you only get mail

00:06.365 --> 00:07.697
once or twice every migration.

00:07.733 --> 00:11.301
- Makes it so much more special, you know?
- ALAN: Uh, I didn't get that. Ooh,

00:11.336 --> 00:14.704
but you did get an invite to
Mom and Craig's engagement party.

00:14.740 --> 00:16.606
<i>Wow, they're really
going through with it, huh?</i>

00:16.642 --> 00:17.707
I have to say, I was pretty sure

00:17.743 --> 00:19.109
your mom would've
come to her senses by now.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.944
Wait, hold on a second here.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.545
It just says Zorn.
There's no "plus one"?

00:22.581 --> 00:23.546
- So?
- So...

00:23.582 --> 00:25.148
so, I mean, what does she
expect me to do?

00:25.183 --> 00:28.585
Just sit at the sad singles table
and get super wasted talking to her

00:28.586 --> 00:31.988
diabetic Aunt Deb, and just go
home to eat curly fries and cry?

00:32.024 --> 00:33.923
Well, I guess I know what
I got to do today.

00:33.959 --> 00:35.659
What, overreact to
an imagined slight?

00:35.694 --> 00:36.993
<i>Don't be silly, Alangulon.</i>

00:37.029 --> 00:39.429
Zorn is going to get his plus one!

- No, I meant Layla.

on Happy Days or something.

So, Alangulon gets a plus one,
but I don't, huh?

01:14.506 --> 01:17.140
EDIE: Zorn,
why would you need a plus one?

01:17.175 --> 01:19.309
<i>Because of that, right there!
Your pity look.</i>

01:19.344 --> 01:20.877

trust me.

01:23.048 --> 01:24.881
Okay, fine. If it means
that much to you, Zorn,

01:24.917 --> 01:26.449
you can have a plus one.

01:26.485 --> 01:28.818
And then, if you can
find a date, that's great,

01:28.854 --> 01:30.787
and if not, it's totally okay.

01:30.822 --> 01:32.489
You're doing it again!

- Well, aside from me, have you

- Sure I have.

01:42.534 --> 01:45.802
- Yeah, what about, uh, Katara?
- The mannequin?

01:45.837 --> 01:48.505
She was an enchanted love doll, Edie.
And a great mom.

01:48.540 --> 01:51.841
- Uh, uh, what about Radiana?
- Radiana? Oh, please.

01:51.877 --> 01:53.510
She was crazy,
not to mention the fact

01:53.545 --> 01:55.278
that she was
literally radioactive.

01:55.314 --> 01:57.213
Look, the important thing is:
I'm bringing a date.

01:57.249 --> 02:00.784
And we will both be having whatever
the opposite of the fish course is.

02:00.819 --> 02:02.419
Well, I'm sure you
and your future lady friend

02:02.454 --> 02:03.853
will make a wonderful couple.

imaginary relationship

won't need any help from you.

Well, now I'm worried
about my toast.

I-I don't like getting all
emotional in front of people.

03:09.688 --> 03:12.188
It's embarrassing
and it's cringe-y.

03:12.224 --> 03:13.790
It's the same feeling I get
when I hear children

03:13.825 --> 03:15.025
being interviewed on the radio.

03:15.060 --> 03:16.893
Can I do something
quick and simple?

03:16.928 --> 03:21.248
- I mean, you know how I feel, right?
- I do, but our closest friends

03:21.249 --> 03:24.429
and work acquaintances don't.
And that's who this party is for.

03:24.464 --> 03:26.689

You're welcome. Plus... [chuckling]
Layla's gonna see me harpin' out

03:44.423 --> 03:46.856
- and probably be like, "Wow, pretty cool."
- CRAIG: Can you do covers?

What would "Lady in Red"
sound like on the glass harp?

03:52.064 --> 03:53.363

for both of us when I say,

03:55.367 --> 03:57.734
- we can't wait.
- Awesome!

03:57.769 --> 03:59.035
That's so great, guys.
Thank you.

As a licensed therapist,
I hope this courtship with

04:02.224 --> 04:06.642
this young lady goes
smoothly, but if it doesn't...

04:07.279 --> 04:09.646
- Wait, why are you wearing a cape?
- Because, Alan,

04:09.681 --> 04:12.282
- a hero doesn't have to...
- Nope. Nope.

04:13.618 --> 04:15.018
I'm gonna practice.

04:16.822 --> 04:19.122
- Why did you say he could do that?
- Was that bad? What?

04:19.156 --> 04:21.491
Well, you know I love Alan
more than anything.

04:21.526 --> 04:22.692
I'm obsessed with him.

04:22.728 --> 04:24.060
So you have to trust me
when I tell you

04:24.096 --> 04:26.629
his music is truly frickin' awful.

04:26.665 --> 04:29.265
I was just pretending to like it
because I love you.

04:29.301 --> 04:31.000
Why does he think he's so good
when he's so bad?

04:31.036 --> 04:33.854
Well, it's my fault.
He sucked at everything

04:33.855 --> 04:36.573
as a kid, so I just constantly
praised him.

04:36.608 --> 04:37.707
I don't want him to embarrass himself

04:37.743 --> 04:39.175
- in front of Layla.
- You know,

his glass harp. That music?

So, Radiana is the best, right?

I mean, she's hot, funny,
she can turn a normal tub

into a hot tub just by sitting
in it, so that's a plus.

should get back into

What is wrong with me?

Like, I've tried to talk to
people about this jealousy stuff

my relationship with my sister?

because that, like,

- No, no, no, no, no, I'm sorry.

girl again, I promise.

She's the best. I mean,
sure, there's a lot of drama

07:58.049 --> 08:00.850
and then she cries radioactive
tears and melts all the walls,

08:00.886 --> 08:02.518
but somehow, it just...
yeah, I mean...

08:02.554 --> 08:04.921
it just... yeah, you know,
it works. [chuckles]

08:04.956 --> 08:06.222
Are you sure this relationship

08:06.258 --> 08:08.909
- is the healthiest thing for you?
- Oh, shut up, we're soul mates!

08:08.910 --> 08:11.394
Oh, my God, she said the
funniest thing the other day.

08:11.429 --> 08:12.896
<i>Actually, you know,
I-I didn't even get it.</i>

08:12.931 --> 08:14.497
And-and then I was like,
"Well, that's not funny,"

08:14.532 --> 08:16.366
and then she started
crying because

08:16.401 --> 08:18.368
she thought I didn't think
she was funny, and I was like,

08:18.403 --> 08:21.070
<i>"No, no, no, you're funny.
You-you don't say funny things,</i>

08:21.106 --> 08:23.706

you know? I love you."

08:23.742 --> 08:25.008
And then we were like,
you know, like...

08:25.043 --> 08:27.410
[Zorn growling and barking]
Uh-huh.

08:27.445 --> 08:28.945
I-I get it. I get it.
[Zorn imitates sheep bleating]

08:28.980 --> 08:31.614
<i>Hey, I was in a relationship
just like that.</i>

08:31.650 --> 08:34.517
It's called a toxic... [coughing]
Ah...

08:34.552 --> 08:36.986
- Oh.
- Linda, you better not be getting me sick.

08:37.022 --> 08:38.520
Okay?
[laughs]

08:38.556 --> 08:40.690
[off-key notes on glass,
knock at door] Knock knock.

08:40.725 --> 08:42.525
- Stop it!
- Hey, Mom, what's up?

08:42.559 --> 08:48.097
Alan,
what if someone you care about

08:48.133 --> 08:50.967
was really, really
bad at something,

08:51.002 --> 08:53.970
but you know they love doing it?

08:54.005 --> 08:55.872
Would you tell that person

08:55.907 --> 08:58.541
so they wouldn't
embarrass themselves

08:58.576 --> 09:00.777
- in front of everybody?
- I get it. I-I get it.

09:00.812 --> 09:03.167
- You do?
- Yeah, I mean, Mom, we know Craig

09:03.236 --> 09:06.916
isn't the best therapist, but
you can't just tell him that.

09:06.952 --> 09:09.586
- I... can't?
- Maybe... you know what?

09:09.587 --> 09:11.554
There's a way you could, like,
sneakily keep him from doing it?

09:11.589 --> 09:14.290
Or... what if you just told him

09:14.326 --> 09:15.892
he was way better
at something else, right?

09:15.927 --> 09:17.727
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

09:17.762 --> 09:21.464
Yes!
That's good.

09:21.499 --> 09:25.868
- Cool.
- Oh, hey, you are very persuasive.

09:25.904 --> 09:26.850
Have you ever thought about

09:26.851 --> 09:29.286
- joining the debate team?
- Nope.

09:31.546 --> 09:34.429
[music]

09:35.547 --> 09:38.414
Radiana, sweetie,
i-is that your toothbrush?

09:38.450 --> 09:40.650
Well, I figured since
I'm staying over so much,

09:40.685 --> 09:44.420
might as well keep it here, right?
Also, my other stuff.

09:44.456 --> 09:48.925
- Also... me.
- You want to move in together, huh?

09:48.960 --> 09:51.627
What a great idea.
It feels right.

09:51.663 --> 09:52.996
Doesn't it just feel right?

09:53.031 --> 09:54.831
<i>Getting a dog.
Meeting your parents.</i>

09:54.866 --> 09:56.299
<i>Combining our bank accounts.</i>

09:56.334 --> 09:58.835
Having twin girls named
Aquafina and Dasani.

09:58.870 --> 10:01.938
- Holding your hand while you die.
- Uh, yeah, yeah, but, I mean,

10:01.973 --> 10:04.574
don't you think we might be
moving a little fast? I...

10:04.609 --> 10:07.076
Oh, I knew it!
You never loved me!

10:07.112 --> 10:10.380
Madison was right.
You'll never settle down!

10:10.415 --> 10:12.949
- And you think I'm fat!
- What?

10:12.984 --> 10:15.585
No, don't listen to Madison,
she's a nut job. [Radiana sobs]

10:15.620 --> 10:17.420
Look, I'll make you a key
tomorrow, okay? I promise.

10:17.455 --> 10:20.923
[gasps] Oh, my God!
Madison is a dumb bitch.

10:20.959 --> 10:25.059
And I knew you loved me.
Now get over here.

10:25.824 --> 10:29.532
[sultry music plays]

10:29.567 --> 10:32.006
[laughing]: Oh, yeah.

10:32.471 --> 10:34.026
[Radiana shudders]

10:34.061 --> 10:36.021
[Zorn giggles, Radiana gasps]

10:40.978 --> 10:43.146
<i>ZORN: Stupid Linda.</i>

10:43.181 --> 10:45.314
I mean, if I were in
a toxic relationship,

10:45.350 --> 10:47.550
I'm pretty sure
there'd be some signs.

10:47.585 --> 10:51.287
[chuckles] Yeah...
Oh. Oh, no.

10:51.322 --> 10:54.057
Oh, my beautiful bangs.
Okay, okay.

10:54.092 --> 10:56.639
This is probably not a coincidence.

10:58.181 --> 10:59.747
Mm, mm, mm.

10:59.782 --> 11:03.083
I need some butter,
because this is a toast.

11:03.119 --> 11:04.485
[both laugh]

11:04.520 --> 11:05.986
I didn't realize we had
so many friends

11:06.022 --> 11:08.589
- and co-workers to stare at us.
- Yeah, I know.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.291
[both laughing]

11:10.326 --> 11:12.059
[weakly]: Whoa, lost my footing.

11:12.094 --> 11:13.494
[Zorn mumbles]

11:13.529 --> 11:17.551
Whoa, easy, Zorn, you big ole
goof, right? [both cackling]

11:19.569 --> 11:23.337
Hey, thanks for having us. We
made out on the way over here.

11:23.372 --> 11:25.673
Zorn... you look like
Matthew McConaughey

11:25.708 --> 11:28.909
at the end of Dallas
Buyers Club. [rattled gasp]

11:28.945 --> 11:31.011
Hey, Mom, have you seen
my case of crystal glasses?

11:31.047 --> 11:32.813
- They're missing?
- Yeah.

11:32.848 --> 11:35.616
- That's insane!
- Okay, I... I'm just gonna...

11:35.651 --> 11:38.085
- you know, look everywhere, so...
- Yeah, or let it go.

11:38.120 --> 11:41.021
- You can let it go. Hey!
- Hey. You hid his box

11:41.057 --> 11:43.190
- of wine glasses, didn't you? Mm.
- I had to.

11:43.226 --> 11:46.093
I'm not gonna let him make a
fool of himself in front of Layla.

11:46.128 --> 11:48.529
Yeah, not to mention your Aunt
Deb, the queen of heckling is here.

11:48.564 --> 11:49.663
She'd have a field day with this.

11:49.699 --> 11:52.233
- Yeah.
- ZORN [strained]: Alangulon!

11:52.268 --> 11:53.834
I need your help.

11:53.869 --> 11:57.304
[Zorn coughs]
Uh... Dad?

11:57.340 --> 11:59.106
You look... different.

11:59.141 --> 12:02.409
- Uh-huh.
- Uh... your eyebrows are missing.

12:02.445 --> 12:04.011
Yeah, sorry, I haven't
seen much of anything

12:04.046 --> 12:05.679
since my left eye went all milky.

12:05.715 --> 12:08.183
- [chuckles] Weird.
- RADIANA: Hey, lay off your old man,

12:08.184 --> 12:10.251
I think it makes him
look distinguished.

12:10.286 --> 12:13.387
[Radiana chuckling and moaning,
Alan groans]

12:13.422 --> 12:15.990
Hey, listen, son, I... you know,
I'm a little weak right now.

12:16.025 --> 12:17.591
Um, you know, from the hay fever.

12:17.627 --> 12:19.226
And I just need you
to help me to the bathroom,

12:19.262 --> 12:20.894
if you don't mind.
Uh, Don't worry,

12:20.930 --> 12:23.497
nothing gross, I just need
you to pull out my penises

12:23.532 --> 12:25.663
and point them at the toilet.

12:26.469 --> 12:28.235
[coughing]

12:28.271 --> 12:30.070
Hey, Dad, have you considered
the possibility that having

12:30.106 --> 12:32.673
a radioactive girlfriend
is making you really sick?

12:32.708 --> 12:35.276
Oh, I've considered it, yeah, and
that's definitely what's happening.

12:35.311 --> 12:36.543
Okay, well, you need to
break up with her.

12:36.579 --> 12:39.913
- She's bad for you.
- Alangulon, I can't break up with her, okay?

12:39.949 --> 12:42.149
- Why not?
- Because...

12:42.184 --> 12:44.618
<i>because...
everyone's got someone.</i>

12:44.654 --> 12:47.655
All right? I mean, your mother
has Craig and you have Layla.

12:47.690 --> 12:50.758
Hell, even Linda's like
the ultimate lady's man.

12:50.793 --> 12:54.595
I just didn't want to be
the only one to... die alone.

12:54.630 --> 12:56.196
<i>Look, I just got you back
in my life,</i>

12:56.232 --> 12:57.831
<i>so I don't want to lose you.</i>

12:57.867 --> 13:00.367
In a bathroom.

13:00.403 --> 13:05.372
<i>Oh, Alangatang. I don't want
to lose you either, buddy.</i>

13:07.410 --> 13:10.778
Dad?
Dad!

13:10.813 --> 13:12.112
[door rattles]
Dad!

13:12.148 --> 13:13.347
<i>Oh, huh, what?
[clears throat]</i>

13:13.382 --> 13:16.817
<i>Sorry, I lost consciousness
there for a hot sec.</i>

13:16.852 --> 13:18.619
ALAN: Hey, uh, Radiana, uh,

13:18.654 --> 13:20.321
my dad asks if you can see him
in the bathroom.

13:20.356 --> 13:22.956
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait. Why does he need to see me?

13:22.992 --> 13:26.327
- Uh.... maybe sex?
- Oh, you are so lucky

13:26.362 --> 13:28.996
- you have such an erotic father.
- Hmm.

13:29.031 --> 13:32.166
Okay, I'll go take care of that
and then you and I are hanging out.

13:32.201 --> 13:34.435
I want to hang out with you!
[laughs]

13:34.470 --> 13:36.704
I can't find
my glasses anywhere.

13:36.739 --> 13:38.105
I don't know what's going on.

13:38.140 --> 13:40.274
Think maybe I can use
coffee mugs instead?

13:40.309 --> 13:41.742
I don't know if that'll even work.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.010
I don't understand
the physics of this

13:43.045 --> 13:44.445
- whole sound thing.
- Yeah, maybe.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.913
I'm going to go, uh,
just take my sweater

13:45.948 --> 13:47.348
really quick, it's a little hot,

13:47.383 --> 13:49.650
because of the...
nuclear-powered woman.

13:49.685 --> 13:51.251
- Yeah.
- Be right back.

13:51.287 --> 13:54.488
Knock knock.
Your son said you needed me.

13:54.523 --> 13:56.090
Possibly for bathroom sex.

13:56.125 --> 13:58.876
<i>Radiana, we need to talk.</i>

14:00.763 --> 14:03.764
[over mic] I guess I'm supposed to
give a toast to Craig now.

14:03.799 --> 14:06.631
<i>So, here goes.
[exhales]</i>

14:06.666 --> 14:09.536
Uh, my friend from
yoga set us up on a blind date.

14:09.572 --> 14:13.640
<i>Uh, we went to this Italian place. Uh...</i>

14:13.676 --> 14:15.642
<i>I can't remember the name.
Anyway,</i>

14:15.678 --> 14:18.445
the date was kind of,
well, awkward.

14:18.481 --> 14:20.481
<i>Uh, and then we started dating.</i>

14:20.516 --> 14:24.118
And then he moved all his
stuff in. And here we are.

14:24.159 --> 14:26.259
[woman clears throat]

14:26.294 --> 14:27.460
Thank you.

14:27.495 --> 14:29.839
[scattered applause]

14:32.067 --> 14:34.534
- It was really moving, sweetie.
- EDIE: Thanks!

14:36.004 --> 14:37.470
[Craig clears throat]

14:37.539 --> 14:41.507
Bliss Bistro on 14th and Cedar.

14:41.543 --> 14:44.243
<i>That's where my life
changed forever.</i>

14:44.279 --> 14:46.580
And it wasn't just because
they have the best damn

14:46.581 --> 14:48.881
breadsticks you'd ever
want to try in your life.

14:48.917 --> 14:49.882
[laughter]

14:49.918 --> 14:51.684
[chuckles]
No.

14:51.720 --> 14:55.321
It's because that's
where I met Edie Bennett.

14:55.357 --> 14:56.589
[sniffles]

14:56.625 --> 14:57.991
<i>CRAIG [in distance]:

14:58.026 --> 15:02.261
<i>and all of my loneliness and
desperation... walked out.</i>

Fear not
for that lonely wanderer.

15:07.535 --> 15:10.837
Fear not
for that wretched disgrace.

15:10.872 --> 15:14.474
For he, at last,
has found his peace,

15:14.509 --> 15:17.646
- Oh, my God.
- in Edie's sweet embrace.

15:17.681 --> 15:19.245
[applause]

15:19.480 --> 15:23.276
Hon, you need to keep talking.
Alan found his glasses!

15:23.311 --> 15:27.107
- I know, but I'm done with my speech.
- Shh-shh... just keep talking.

<i>Um... So, many of you
may not know this,</i>

15:30.425 --> 15:33.626

<i>RADIANA: How could you do this

16:15.061 --> 16:17.762

- Wha... Craig, this is insane.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.767
It's too dangerous.
You can't go in there.

16:22.802 --> 16:26.671
All therapy is dangerous, Edie, but
this is what a hero has got to do.

16:26.706 --> 16:28.773
Plus, I stopped at the kitchen
and got these pans

16:28.808 --> 16:34.478

16:59.706 --> 17:01.138
<i>knowing you failed.</i>

17:01.174 --> 17:02.973
Okay, Radiana.
Let me tell you a little story.

17:03.009 --> 17:07.211
It's the story of a young man
who had his heart broken.

17:07.246 --> 17:09.613
He thought that he would
never fall in love.

17:09.648 --> 17:11.682
Do you know where
that young man is today?

17:11.718 --> 17:15.252
Let me guess.
He's at his engagement party.

17:15.288 --> 17:19.457
- The man is you.
- No, the man was my friend, Andrew.

17:19.492 --> 17:21.826
And he spent many years alone
until, finally,

17:21.861 --> 17:23.560
he took his own life
with his service weapon.

17:23.596 --> 17:26.063
<i>ZORN: Oh, my God!
You are so bad at this!</i>

17:26.098 --> 17:28.966
RADIANA [sobbing]: Why are you even
trying to be a therapist?

17:29.001 --> 17:30.601
Because it's my dream.

17:30.636 --> 17:33.404
- And I know I can do it.
- Oh, boy.

17:33.439 --> 17:35.539
Have there been setbacks?
Yes.

17:35.575 --> 17:40.411
Has every attempt to help
someone ended in abject failure?

17:40.446 --> 17:45.449
Sure.
But I know in my heart

17:45.485 --> 17:49.387
that therapy... is my destiny.

17:49.422 --> 17:52.890
Ugh! You moron!
Can't you see it'll never work?

17:52.925 --> 17:55.025
Can't you see how
pathetic you look, you...

17:55.061 --> 17:57.862
Oh. Oh, my God.

17:57.897 --> 18:00.765
What? Are you having a
breakthrough?

18:00.766 --> 18:03.634
Because I've never seen one before
and I don't know what to look for.

18:03.669 --> 18:05.569
<i>That's what I'm like.</i>

18:05.605 --> 18:08.939
I'm just some sad lady
hanging on to a dream

18:08.975 --> 18:13.878
that will never, ever come true.
Just like you.

18:13.913 --> 18:15.946
Okay, that's a little harsh.

18:15.982 --> 18:19.917
- That just totally helped me.
- Oh. Okay. Well, cool.

18:19.952 --> 18:22.119
Good-bye, Zorn.
I deserve better than you,

18:22.155 --> 18:24.355
and it's time
I give that to myself.

18:24.390 --> 18:25.790
I'm going to go
to an ashram

18:25.825 --> 18:29.560
near this Mexican restaurant
and get centered,

18:29.595 --> 18:34.136
and then get smashed
on margaritas. Peace!

18:36.068 --> 18:38.469
[exhales] Oh man.
[chuckles]

18:38.504 --> 18:40.604
I did it. I did it!

18:40.640 --> 18:43.369
Hey, Zorn! Zorn, I did, uh...

18:44.281 --> 18:46.444
Zorn's dead!

18:46.479 --> 18:48.646
[ragged inhale]

18:48.681 --> 18:50.514
Hey, Mrs. B., I'm gonna go.

18:50.550 --> 18:52.817
Will you tell Alan I'm sorry
I can't hear him play?

18:52.885 --> 18:56.153
Yes. That is too bad.
Well, it's good to see you, Layla.

18:56.189 --> 18:57.254
- Yeah. You, too.
- Um...

18:57.290 --> 18:58.656
Better get home,
your parents are gonna worry

18:58.691 --> 19:01.292
- you died in an accident.
- Oh. Okay well, um...

19:01.327 --> 19:04.829
Congratulations. Craig seems
like a really amazing guy.

19:04.864 --> 19:08.032
I know, he was quite...
the hero tonight.

19:08.067 --> 19:11.735
Yeah! I mean, I-I have no
idea who Joey Lawrence is,

19:11.771 --> 19:15.481
but it was so bad
it was almost cute.

19:16.909 --> 19:18.909
Um... Okay.

19:18.945 --> 19:21.345
Text your parents.
Tell them you haven't been

19:21.380 --> 19:24.415
in a terrible accident.
You need to hear Alan play.

19:24.570 --> 19:27.053
Oh. Okay.
[chuckles]

19:27.773 --> 19:29.506
So, I know things

19:29.542 --> 19:32.443
got a little crazy there
for a bit, but don't worry,

19:32.478 --> 19:34.578
the nuclear meltdown
has been averted.

19:34.614 --> 19:36.246
[indistinct chatter]

19:36.282 --> 19:37.948
Oh. You guys didn't know
about that. Okay.

19:37.984 --> 19:42.186
Uh, and now, some music
from my wonderful son, Alan.

19:42.221 --> 19:43.621
[applause]

19:43.656 --> 19:44.922
[Alan grunts]

19:48.961 --> 19:51.462
[glasses ringing]

19:53.966 --> 19:57.634
- You're not making your pity face.
- Yeah, I know.

19:57.703 --> 19:59.570
<i>I'm proud of him.
And I'm proud of you.</i>

19:59.605 --> 20:03.574
You helped Zorn tonight,
and you helped me.

20:03.609 --> 20:06.477
You're the best thing that
ever happened to me, Craig.

20:06.512 --> 20:09.747
I mean, you're just yourself and
you don't let people change you.

20:09.782 --> 20:13.763
Maybe jot these down,
it might make a nice toast.

20:14.186 --> 20:16.253
[music]

20:16.288 --> 20:18.956
<i>ZORN: Oh man, look at
those two loveflargs, huh?</i>

20:18.991 --> 20:21.759
- Screw 'em.
- No, I actually mean it. I'm...

20:21.794 --> 20:25.129
- I'm happy for them.
- Huh. Look at you.

20:25.164 --> 20:27.698
I mean, sure, yeah, me and
Edie had some great times,

20:27.733 --> 20:29.399
but we're different people now.

20:29.535 --> 20:31.735
<i>And seeing her with Craig,
and Alangulon</i>

20:31.770 --> 20:33.170
<i>with that narrow-hipped
farm wench,</i>

20:33.205 --> 20:36.306
it's like everyone I love
has someone they love.

20:36.342 --> 20:38.642
And that gives me hope
that I'll find someone, too.

20:38.677 --> 20:41.945
Hey, one day you and I are gonna
find the loves of our lives.

20:41.981 --> 20:43.680
Yeah.
Sure, of course we will.

20:43.749 --> 20:48.585
Until then, let's go
bang those two waiters.

20:48.621 --> 20:50.187
So wait, I get the woman
and you get the man?

20:50.222 --> 20:51.622
Or what,
we're just gonna flip a coin?

20:51.690 --> 20:53.323
Whatever.

20:54.860 --> 20:57.060
Uh, here's Heather Locklear
from Melrose Place

20:57.096 --> 21:01.806
arguing over rent.
"Okay, I'll pay it!"

21:02.463 --> 21:04.926
Thank you. Thanks.

21:05.938 --> 21:07.938
So here's my impression
of Joe Pesci.

21:07.973 --> 21:09.339
[man snores, snorts]

21:09.375 --> 21:13.765
<i>- "You laughing at me?" Right?
- I don't know who that was?</i>

21:13.800 --> 21:16.880
Here's my impression
of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.

21:16.916 --> 21:19.249
"You got it, dude!"

21:19.285 --> 21:23.338
<i>- MAN: Oh, please...
- [chuckles] So, anyways...</i>

21:23.373 --> 21:25.361
- Where y'all from?
- Oh!

21:25.381 --> 21:27.775
[horn honking]

21:27.810 --> 21:31.576
