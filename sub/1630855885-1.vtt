Welcome back to Boston.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.939
My God, you haven't aged a day.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.550
And you...

00:28.593 --> 00:30.030
Well, thanks for coming
to pick me up.

00:30.073 --> 00:32.249
My pleasure.

00:32.293 --> 00:33.816
How was your father's funeral?

00:33.859 --> 00:37.124
Emotional, but it
was a good sendoff.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.603
He'll be missed.

00:38.647 --> 00:41.606
-Of course. My condolences.
-Thank you.

00:41.650 --> 00:44.261
Weren't you traveling with your
nephew? Niles and Daphne's son?

00:44.305 --> 00:45.610
Yes, yes, he should be
along any minute.

00:45.654 --> 00:47.786
Sorry for the delay,
Uncle Frasier.

00:47.830 --> 00:50.267
I took a sleeping pill
on the flight for my anxiety

00:50.311 --> 00:52.878
and I had to balance it out
with three shots of espresso.

00:52.922 --> 00:55.011
So, I am feeling...

00:55.055 --> 00:57.883

David, I'd like you
to meet Alan Cornwall.

01:00.451 --> 01:03.106
Alan, meet my nephew David.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.977
Alan is an old pal of mine
from my Oxford days

01:05.021 --> 01:07.502
and the professor who wrote
your recommendation to Harvard.

01:07.545 --> 01:09.156
Well met, David.

01:09.199 --> 01:10.766
How have your first few weeks
at school been?

01:10.809 --> 01:12.376
A little rocky, to be honest.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.074
Well, chin up.

01:14.117 --> 01:15.988
You can't be doing any worse
than this one poor kid

01:16.032 --> 01:17.251

On day one, in front
of 300 students,

01:20.210 --> 01:21.820
he runs in late, trips,

01:21.864 --> 01:23.474
spills coffee all down
his white shirt,

01:23.518 --> 01:26.695
and then he loses a shoe
that we still haven't found.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.218

01:28.262 --> 01:29.828

in your life.

Frasier Crane walks away
from his talk show.

01:45.148 --> 01:46.976

"Get off your knees,
stop begging,

I'm already out the door."

-And things with Charlotte?
-She told me the same thing.

01:52.024 --> 01:53.983
But it was for the best.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.723
After 20 years in Chicago,

01:55.767 --> 01:57.378
it was time for George Bailey
to get that old bag

01:57.420 --> 01:59.380
out of the closet
and see the world.

01:59.423 --> 02:00.990
-Ah.
-Ubp, ubp, ubp.

I don't have the heart to tell
him that's not my luggage.

02:28.887 --> 02:31.368
Oh, gosh, I could sure
use a breve latte

02:31.412 --> 02:32.891

-Excuse me? Frasier Crane?
-Yes?

02:34.676 --> 02:37.200
Sir, I know it's exciting to see
a celebrity like my uncle,

02:37.244 --> 02:38.767
but I beg you
for a little privacy.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.508
He just had
a very exhausting trip.

02:40.551 --> 02:41.987
Look how haggard he is.

02:42.031 --> 02:44.164
Don't worry, I have
an eidetic memory.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.035
So you tell me your address,

02:46.078 --> 02:47.819
and I'll make sure you get
an autographed photo.

02:47.863 --> 02:49.343
I don't know either of you.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.823
He dropped his wallet
and I saw the license.

Oh, good Lord. Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.916
-Sorry about that, Uncle.
-Oh, forget it.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.918
I can't. Eidetic memory.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.311

my class.

03:09.363 --> 03:10.842
Oh, it was my pleasure.

see Freddy in Seattle?

03:15.804 --> 03:17.632
Ugh, you Americans and
your ghastly attachments

03:17.675 --> 03:19.068
to your children.

03:19.111 --> 03:20.939
No, no, he didn't make it
to the funeral.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.637
Some sort of a work emergency.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.856
And how are things
between you two?

03:24.900 --> 03:27.728
I remember how tense it was
when he dropped out of Harvard.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.948
All these years later,
I still don't get it.

Hello.

Okay.

04:30.052 --> 04:32.402
So...

04:32.446 --> 04:34.926
Your place is so...

04:36.014 --> 04:37.494
Damn, when I started
that sentence

04:37.538 --> 04:38.930
I thought I'd think
of something.

04:38.974 --> 04:42.586
Yeah, sorry. The Picasso's
getting reframed

04:42.630 --> 04:44.893
and the whole second floor's
in the shop.

04:44.936 --> 04:47.983
You know, you have your mother's
sense of humor, Frederick.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.201
[chuckling]

04:49.245 --> 04:51.029
No, no, it's-it's charming,

04:51.073 --> 04:52.596
it reminds me of the sort
of place one would...

04:52.640 --> 04:54.903
wrestle a cartoon rat
for a crust of bread.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.687
There it is.

04:56.731 --> 04:59.037
Your subtle reminder
I'd make more money

04:59.081 --> 05:00.735
if I wasn't just a firefighter.

05:00.778 --> 05:02.737
No, no, I admire what you do.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.826
It's a noble profession,
it's just that...

05:04.869 --> 05:07.002
you did so well in
your psych classes at Harvard.

05:07.045 --> 05:09.178
Right, but I wanted
to do something important.

05:09.221 --> 05:10.658
What I do is important.

05:10.701 --> 05:11.746
It's at least as important
as what you do.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.313
Okay, sure, let's find someone

05:13.356 --> 05:15.227
who has low self-esteem
and is also on fire,

05:15.271 --> 05:17.317
and see which one of us
they run to first.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.538
[laughs] There's that mother
of yours again.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.323
Sorry.

05:23.366 --> 05:26.456
No, I'm sorry.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.503
We missed you at the funeral.

05:29.546 --> 05:30.982
And, um...

05:31.026 --> 05:32.680
I brought you something.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.508
I think your grandfather
would've wanted you to have it.

05:34.551 --> 05:38.163
Oh, cool. Thanks.

05:38.207 --> 05:40.601
I'll open it later.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.080
Later? Well, I know he's not

05:42.124 --> 05:44.648
waiting for a thank-you note,
but still.

05:44.692 --> 05:47.651
Freddy, can you turn down
your dad's TV show, it's r--

05:47.695 --> 05:49.305
Oh!

05:49.349 --> 05:50.698
It's a live show.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.395
Wow. Hi.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.876
I don't need to be told
who you are.

05:54.919 --> 05:57.966
I wish I could say the same.

05:58.009 --> 05:59.707
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm Eve.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.926
I'm sure Freddy's told you
all about me.

06:01.970 --> 06:05.234
I have a funny anecdote
about that: no, he has not.

06:05.277 --> 06:06.627
Didn't know you
had a girlfriend,

06:06.670 --> 06:07.845
let alone one who'd
moved in with you.

06:07.889 --> 06:09.325
-Oh, we--
-We've been caught up

06:09.369 --> 06:11.153
in the, you know,
whirlwind romance.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.329
You know how that is.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.287
Anyway, Dad,
so good to see you.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.289
What? Well, hold on,

06:17.332 --> 06:19.335
why don't I get you guys
a cup of coffee or something,

06:19.379 --> 06:21.642
or even dinner? I mean,
we've got a lot to catch up on.

06:21.685 --> 06:22.904
Oh, sure, yeah, let's see.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.514
Uh, I got a new
pair of sneakers,

06:24.558 --> 06:26.081
hit a triple in softball,

06:26.124 --> 06:29.084
and I realized
I just don't get jazz.

06:30.433 --> 06:31.826
Anyway, now you're
all caught up.

06:31.869 --> 06:34.437
Freddy. I'm leaving
for Paris tomorrow.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.004
Can't you just spare me
half an hour?

06:36.047 --> 06:37.875
Dad, I wish I could.

06:37.919 --> 06:40.530
But Eve's got a double shift,
I got a crazy week at work...

06:40.574 --> 06:42.053
How do you know?

06:42.097 --> 06:43.533
Are they scheduling
the fires in advance now?

06:43.577 --> 06:47.276
Dad, it's just...
It's just not a good time.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.801
All right, well...

06:52.063 --> 06:53.717
I'll see you next time.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.719
[Freddy sighs]

06:55.763 --> 06:58.766
You know, I am still
not used to you

06:58.808 --> 07:00.507
calling me your girlfriend.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.291
Do you know why?

07:02.334 --> 07:03.510
Because you're not
my girlfriend?

07:03.553 --> 07:04.859
Because I'm not your girlfriend.

07:04.902 --> 07:07.209
I'm sorry for roping
you in like that,

07:07.252 --> 07:08.515
it's just I didn't
feel like explaining

07:08.558 --> 07:10.647
our whole situation
to my dad, he...

07:10.691 --> 07:13.389
And I-I love the guy,
but he can be kind of...

07:13.433 --> 07:15.304
Ugh!

07:15.347 --> 07:17.611
So, he doesn't know about John?

07:17.654 --> 07:19.961
He does not know about John.

07:20.004 --> 07:21.832
Thank God I got him
out of here fast enough.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.399
He smelled really good, though.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.706
Yeah, he always smells
really good.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.623
[applause]

07:31.320 --> 07:33.670
Thank you.
Gosh, that was exhilarating.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.716
That was great, Uncle Frasier.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.718
That's right. Uncle Frasier.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.502
He's my uncle.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.765
He's right, you know.

07:41.808 --> 07:44.638
I've rarely seen these students
so engaged.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.422
Then again, I've rarely
seen these students.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.946
I really should
pop into class more often.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.254
-Oh, no.
-What? What? Who's that?

07:52.297 --> 07:54.648
It's our department head
Olivia Finch.

07:54.691 --> 07:57.041
Brilliant scholar,
but an absolute terror.

07:57.085 --> 08:00.262
Cold. Disengaged. Narcissistic.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.656
She's called me
all those things.

08:02.699 --> 08:03.961
She sounds dreadful.

08:04.005 --> 08:05.746
Dr. Crane,
you are a true legend.

08:05.789 --> 08:08.749
And yet there's something
about her I just like.

08:08.792 --> 08:09.924
-Olivia Finch.
-Hello.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.403
Mm, if I may be so bold,

08:11.447 --> 08:12.666
I'd like to skip
straight to the point.

08:12.709 --> 08:14.494
Every morning, I wake up
and I think,

08:14.537 --> 08:15.930
"How can I make
this department better?"

08:15.973 --> 08:17.235
And since I can't fire Alan--

08:17.279 --> 08:19.237
Tenure!

08:19.281 --> 08:21.326
the next best thing would be to
have you teach here permanently.

08:21.370 --> 08:23.154
Wow, uh, uh...

08:23.198 --> 08:24.678
That is a tempting offer--

08:24.721 --> 08:27.507
-So it's a yes!
-But I have plans in Paris.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.465
-So it's a maybe.
-I leave in the morning.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.075
So it's a soft maybe.

08:31.119 --> 08:35.384
You see, I-I'm starting
research on my next book,

08:35.427 --> 08:37.125
The Lost Manuscripts
of Marivaux.

08:37.168 --> 08:40.171
-[gasps] Marivaux?
-Mm.

08:40.215 --> 08:42.347
You know, if you're interested
in obscure Europeans

08:42.390 --> 08:44.044
who haven't been published
in 300 years,

08:44.087 --> 08:46.221
you should just stay here
and study Alan.

08:50.617 --> 08:54.316
I'm not going to stand here
and let you insult me.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.274
I insist you do it over drinks.

08:56.318 --> 08:58.059
To the bar?

08:58.102 --> 09:00.191
-Don't you have
a class right now?
-Probably.

09:00.235 --> 09:02.672
Tenure.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.981
What is it about
the city of Boston

09:07.024 --> 09:08.635
that leads me to forego
the more sophisticated

09:08.678 --> 09:10.637
temptation
of the fermented grape?

09:10.680 --> 09:14.075
Sitting here, with a cold
brew in my hand,

09:14.118 --> 09:19.167
I feel... amalgamated
with the hoi polloi.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.299
You are the classic everyman.

09:21.343 --> 09:22.823
[chuckling]

09:22.866 --> 09:24.172
How does it feel
being back in Boston?

09:24.215 --> 09:26.609
Mixed emotions, honestly.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.351
I'm not sure I was ever
my best self here.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.353
I may have spent
a little too much time...

09:31.396 --> 09:33.224
at a certain bar.

09:34.486 --> 09:36.227
-Dr. Crane?
-Hmm?

09:36.271 --> 09:37.664
I was in your lecture.
It was life-changing.

09:37.707 --> 09:39.361
I was going to be a dance major,

09:39.404 --> 09:41.537
but now I'm switching to pre-med
to be a psychiatrist.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.061
Well, I thank you.

09:44.105 --> 09:46.890
And I'm certain your parents
will thank me.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.413
[chuckling]

09:48.457 --> 09:49.937
Apologies, Frasier.

09:49.980 --> 09:52.156
The worst thing about teaching
are the students.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.290
No, no, that was lovely, I...

09:55.333 --> 09:58.598
Why is it I am able to connect
with all those young people,

09:58.641 --> 10:00.774
yet it's impossible
with my own son?

10:00.817 --> 10:02.340
Oh, what's going on
with your son?

10:02.384 --> 10:04.125
Well, I wish I knew.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.648
He missed
his grandfather's funeral,

10:05.692 --> 10:07.955
he's got a girlfriend
I've never even heard of,

10:07.998 --> 10:09.173
and when I told him
I wanted to spend

10:09.217 --> 10:11.523
more time with him, he said no.

10:11.567 --> 10:14.744
Have you considered
that he hates you?

10:16.528 --> 10:18.052
You mustn't give up.

10:18.095 --> 10:21.142
As they say, a no is just
a yes in a trench coat.

10:21.185 --> 10:23.144
Who says that?

10:23.187 --> 10:24.624
It's an American thing.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.714
All I'm trying to say is

10:27.757 --> 10:29.237
you cannot take no
for an answer.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.543
The door is never firmly shut.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.284
You will connect with your son,

10:33.328 --> 10:35.896
and I will get you
to teach at Harvard.

10:35.939 --> 10:38.072
I'm not teaching at Harvard.
I'm getting on a plane tomorrow.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.987
[chuckles] We'll see.

10:41.336 --> 10:44.644
You know, from the wreckage
of your logic,

10:44.687 --> 10:47.821
I am pulling a thread of wisdom.

10:47.864 --> 10:50.780
I could buy a couple of steaks,
a bottle of Scotch,

10:50.824 --> 10:52.782
stop by, and we'll
hash things out.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.784
He'll be alone.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.569
C'est l'occasion parfait
pour un tête-à-tête.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.748
Another brewski
for the everyman.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.708
I'll get it.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.406
My God, he'd be such an asset
to our department.

11:08.450 --> 11:11.105
He would draw more students,
which would mean more funding,

11:11.148 --> 11:12.976
which would set me
on track to being provost

11:13.020 --> 11:15.587
one year younger than my sister
became provost at Yale!

11:15.631 --> 11:17.067
[laughs]

11:17.111 --> 11:19.287
My God, you're tightly wound,
aren't you?

11:20.592 --> 11:23.726
When was the last time
you had a... date?

11:23.770 --> 11:26.511
Some of us care
about our careers, Alan.

11:26.555 --> 11:30.037
-So it's been...?
-Men are afraid of smart women.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.779
It would be nice to have my
old friend back in town, though.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.345
But he's leaving tomorrow

11:34.389 --> 11:35.869
and tonight he's having
dinner with his son.

11:35.912 --> 11:37.958
Damn it, why do family
always get in the way

11:38.001 --> 11:40.743
of the important things in life?

11:40.787 --> 11:42.397
-Here we are.
-Mm.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.051
Well, what happened
to the beers?

11:44.094 --> 11:45.966
Sherry saw me.

11:46.009 --> 11:47.750
I can't say no to her.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.404
[laughs]

11:49.447 --> 11:51.145
Cheers.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.454
This is bad sherry.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.332
[knocking]

12:04.375 --> 12:07.378
Freddy, tonight I am cooking you
a five-star meal,

12:07.422 --> 12:08.945
and I won't take no
for an answer.

12:08.989 --> 12:11.078
Would you take "not now"?

12:11.121 --> 12:14.037
Please, I miss you. I'd like
to spend some time with you.

12:14.081 --> 12:18.215
You know, I have a Kagoshima A5,
decadently marbled,

12:18.259 --> 12:21.915
bursting with umami
in a retronasal symphony.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.483
Steaks. I have steaks.

12:25.527 --> 12:27.921
Damn it, I love steaks.
Sure, come on in.

12:27.964 --> 12:29.661
Great. A one-on-one dinner
with my son.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.576
Hey, fam!

12:32.534 --> 12:34.449
David, what are you doing here?

12:34.492 --> 12:36.103
I thought it'd be
a fun surprise.

12:36.146 --> 12:38.366
David, you can't just barge
in here unexpectedly.

12:38.409 --> 12:40.760
It's incredibly...
thoughtful of you.

12:40.803 --> 12:43.806
So, this is your place.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.242
So cool.

12:46.548 --> 12:49.464
You ever kiss a girl in here?

12:49.507 --> 12:51.814
FRASIER: Uh, David,
do you think Freddy and I

12:51.858 --> 12:53.598
could just have
an evening alone?

12:53.642 --> 12:55.992
I-I, we really need a deep dive
into our relationship.

12:56.036 --> 12:59.953
Or we could stay in
the shallows, with David.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.041
Welcome, cuz.

13:01.084 --> 13:04.871
"Cuz"? You gave me a nickname?

13:04.914 --> 13:06.786
It's happening, David.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.352
Be cool.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.398
Well, dinner for three, then.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.703
Room for two more?

13:11.747 --> 13:13.096
Oh, for the love of God!

13:13.140 --> 13:14.619
Well, we thought
we'd help you cook

13:14.663 --> 13:15.925
so you could have
more time with your son.

13:15.969 --> 13:18.275
Oh, that is...

13:18.319 --> 13:20.364
Actually, that's quite helpful.
Thank you.

13:20.408 --> 13:21.757
And if it comes up organically,

13:21.801 --> 13:23.498
we can chat about
how Harvard professors

13:23.541 --> 13:26.936
have access to the world's
preeminent research library.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.809
You also get a T.A.

13:29.852 --> 13:32.507
I use mine to walk my cat.

13:33.464 --> 13:34.901
Good God, Macallan 25?

13:34.944 --> 13:37.642
This can cost thousands
a bottle.

13:37.686 --> 13:41.646
I can't let you waste it on
people who won't appreciate it.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.300
No, no, come on, come on.

13:43.344 --> 13:46.564
I know a lovely little bridge
we can drink this under.

13:46.608 --> 13:50.220
Freddy, you remember Alan,
of course, and this is Olivia.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.353
They're going to help us
with dinner this evening.

13:52.396 --> 13:53.615
-Hi.
-Freddy.

13:53.658 --> 13:54.964
You're a firefighter.

13:55.008 --> 13:57.358
Where do I buy
the calendar? [laughs]

13:58.446 --> 14:01.362
I heard about your grandfather.
I'm so sorry for your loss.

14:03.538 --> 14:05.148
Not exactly the evening
I'd envisioned,

14:05.192 --> 14:07.890
but I promise you this,
no more unexpected guests.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.544
Hey, guys.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.154
Okay, that one's not mine.

14:11.198 --> 14:14.418
Eve. You're home earlier
than we expected you to be.

14:14.462 --> 14:16.551
Dad, will just give me
one second?

14:16.594 --> 14:18.205
[door closes]

14:19.510 --> 14:21.425
I don't get it.

14:21.469 --> 14:24.515
Why is Frederick
acting so strangely?

14:24.559 --> 14:27.257
Maybe I can help you,
Uncle Frasier.

14:27.301 --> 14:29.477
Be the Watson to your Sherlock.

14:30.957 --> 14:34.264
[chuckles] That's very kind
of you, David.

14:34.308 --> 14:37.702
You know, you remind me
of your mother.

14:37.746 --> 14:40.401
Perpetually optimistic.
Always seeing the...

14:40.444 --> 14:41.793
Do you have to put in eye drops

14:41.837 --> 14:44.535
right as we're having
a nice moment?

14:46.581 --> 14:49.410
You can't tell me it's
not Sahara dry in here.

14:49.453 --> 14:52.587
Now you remind me
of your father.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.676
I know, I'm sorry,
this is weird,

14:54.719 --> 14:57.113
but would you please keep
pretending to be my girlfriend?

14:57.157 --> 15:00.464
So, I'm just supposed to lie
about who I am all night?

15:00.508 --> 15:01.944
Look, I know it's a lot to ask--

15:01.988 --> 15:04.077
No, I love it.

15:05.295 --> 15:09.212
As an actor, creating
characters is what I do.

15:09.256 --> 15:11.345
-Ooh, maybe I gives
myself an accent.
-No.

15:11.388 --> 15:15.001
Let's... Let's just otherwise
stick to the truth.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.828
-You're a waitress.
-But we're dating.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.961
-Right.
-Got it.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.528
So, what do we do about John?

15:20.571 --> 15:22.617
FREDDY:
Right, the baby.

15:22.660 --> 15:27.013
Uh, he can't just
hang out on the stoop?

15:27.056 --> 15:29.929
He can't just hang out
on the stoop!

15:31.974 --> 15:35.238
Come, Watson. The game's afoot.

15:36.848 --> 15:40.461
Let us canvass
the area for clues.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.724
-To... Ah.
-[snaps fingers]

15:42.767 --> 15:43.986
What's this?

15:45.161 --> 15:46.684
A bedsheet?

15:46.728 --> 15:48.338
On a couch?

15:48.382 --> 15:49.600
Did they have a fight?

15:49.644 --> 15:52.560
Is there trouble in paradise?

15:52.603 --> 15:54.475
Uncle Frasier, look.

15:56.477 --> 15:57.957
Cheerios!

15:58.000 --> 16:00.568
Not only is he sleeping
on the couch,

16:00.611 --> 16:05.094
he's also eating dry cereal
like some sort of an infant.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.662
See, David, this is why we
can't let a single detail

16:07.705 --> 16:09.403
escape our notice.

16:09.446 --> 16:13.320
Observe, if you will, the linear
pattern of these Cheerios.

16:13.363 --> 16:15.191
OLIVIA:
Dr. Crane?

16:17.846 --> 16:19.761
Does anyone have
any food allergies?

16:19.804 --> 16:22.416
Oh, do I?

16:22.459 --> 16:24.505
Here, I have a laminated card.

16:26.115 --> 16:27.943
The ones in red are fatal.

16:29.597 --> 16:31.164
Eve, any allergies?

16:31.207 --> 16:32.382
No.

16:35.820 --> 16:39.389
That girl out there,
Freddy's girlfriend.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.000
There's something about her.

16:41.043 --> 16:43.915
[scoffs] She doesn't seem
all that special to me.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.526
No, I mean she looks familiar.

16:45.569 --> 16:48.877
-Was she in one of your classes?
-Possible.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.705
Doesn't explain why
she looks familiar.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.924
Can we focus for just a moment?

16:52.968 --> 16:55.449
We are here tonight for one
reason and one reason only.

16:55.492 --> 16:58.104
To drink the Macallan 25.

16:58.147 --> 17:00.236
To convince Dr. Crane
to teach at Harvard.

17:01.803 --> 17:04.153
Finally, Freddy, we have
a chance to talk a bit.

17:04.196 --> 17:06.242
Dr. Crane? Could you join us
in the kitchen please?

17:06.286 --> 17:08.375
I have a question
about the steaks.

17:08.417 --> 17:10.550
Excuse me.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.335
What about the steaks?

17:12.378 --> 17:15.077
They could not be higher.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.123
With your help, we could turn
the Harvard Psyche Department

17:17.165 --> 17:18.515
into the Harvard
of psyche departments.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.778
We are not having
this discussion.

17:20.821 --> 17:23.172
Please just help me
with the dinner.

17:23.215 --> 17:24.608
Mm.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.262
Oh, Freddy, finally
we have a chance--

17:26.306 --> 17:28.176
We know you've been eating
breakfast on the floor!

17:29.831 --> 17:32.007
What we don't know is why!

17:32.051 --> 17:35.880
David, perhaps you could be
of some help in the kitchen.

17:37.186 --> 17:39.536
[chuckling]: Thank you.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.582
So, Freddy--

17:41.625 --> 17:43.627
Dr. Cornwall said no.

17:43.671 --> 17:46.108
[chuckling]

17:46.152 --> 17:47.457
That British wit.

17:47.501 --> 17:50.112
[chuckling]

17:50.156 --> 17:52.723
[thudding]

17:55.813 --> 17:58.947
[thudding continues]

17:58.990 --> 18:00.296
[thudding stops]

18:01.732 --> 18:03.647
All right, great.

18:04.648 --> 18:07.173
Say, how about some Macallan?

18:07.216 --> 18:08.783
Not right now, thanks.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.353
Eve, why don't you tell me
about yourself.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.442
What do you do for a living?

18:15.485 --> 18:17.966
Uh, I'm a private investigator.

18:18.923 --> 18:23.145
Oh, my. That sounds fascinating.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.756
Do you specialize
in any particular area?

18:25.800 --> 18:27.236
Heartbreak.

18:28.237 --> 18:30.196
There's 10,000 tales
in this city

18:30.239 --> 18:31.762
and I've heard 'em all.

18:32.763 --> 18:34.809
This one skirt
knocked on my door.

18:34.852 --> 18:37.464
She had six-inch heels
and a four-inch scar--

18:37.507 --> 18:40.206
You know what?
Drinking sounds great.

18:40.249 --> 18:42.773
-Where's that Macallan?
-Oh, thank you, Alan.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.688
Oh, too much?

18:44.732 --> 18:46.212
Not enough?

18:46.255 --> 18:47.996
I have a fake gun
in the bedroom if we need it.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.563
W-What? No. What?

18:49.606 --> 18:51.304
What we need
is to speed this up.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.523
John can wake up any second.

18:53.567 --> 18:56.526
Dad, ugh, I think we're gonna
have to cut this short.

18:56.570 --> 18:59.442
Eve was just telling me
she doesn't feel very well.

19:02.097 --> 19:03.054
[coughs]

19:03.098 --> 19:05.448
See? She sounds terrible.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.276
I mean, I think we should
call it a night.

19:07.320 --> 19:10.453
-But we haven't eaten yet.
-Just opened the Macallan.

19:10.497 --> 19:11.846
I'm gonna check on the baby.

19:11.889 --> 19:14.718
Dad, I'll be, uh,
I'll be right back.

19:19.767 --> 19:23.597
I'm no stranger to an
underperforming dinner party.

19:26.077 --> 19:29.037
But I had high hopes.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.560
I know something's going on.

19:30.604 --> 19:32.736
I just wish Freddy and I
were close enough

19:32.780 --> 19:35.478
that he would trust me.

19:35.522 --> 19:37.001
I, uh...

19:37.045 --> 19:38.699
guess that's just
the way things are

19:38.742 --> 19:41.180
between fathers and sons.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.573
I'll tell them to wrap things
up in the kitchen.

19:43.617 --> 19:44.966
We'll be on our way soon.

19:45.009 --> 19:47.534
-Dr. Crane, uh...
-Yes?

19:48.535 --> 19:51.973
Freddy wouldn't want me
to tell you this, but...

19:52.016 --> 19:55.237
you have raised
one heck of a son.

19:55.281 --> 20:00.808
He's smart and strong and brave.

20:00.851 --> 20:03.463
He's always been there for us.

20:06.161 --> 20:09.164
Would you excuse me a moment?

20:14.604 --> 20:16.824
Eve said "us."

20:17.955 --> 20:22.046
She said "Freddy's always
been there for us."

20:22.090 --> 20:24.745
What do you suppose that means?

20:24.788 --> 20:26.747
Eve! Yes, that's her name.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.227
I thought I knew that girl.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.576
She works down at the bar.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.839
-She does?
-Indeed, yeah.

20:31.882 --> 20:36.322
I believe she's also just
had a baby with some fireman.

20:41.979 --> 20:43.242
Oh.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.202
Oh...

20:47.246 --> 20:49.160
They have a child.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.553
Freddy must have gotten in
over his head,

20:50.597 --> 20:51.946
and he was too ashamed
to tell me.

20:51.989 --> 20:54.601
That's why he wants
to get rid of me.

20:54.644 --> 20:57.734
I'm... I'm a grandfather.

20:57.778 --> 21:01.564
[chuckles] I always wanted
to be a grandfather. Gosh...

21:01.608 --> 21:03.784
Why wouldn't he just
tell me the truth?

21:03.827 --> 21:06.221
Mm. Maybe you should
just talk to him.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.485
Maybe. Or...

21:13.315 --> 21:15.143
I could let them twist
in the wind

21:15.186 --> 21:17.319
with their little lie.

21:18.494 --> 21:21.802
Possibly provide
a few gusts of my own

21:21.845 --> 21:23.543
to further entangle them
in their deception.

21:23.586 --> 21:26.110
And when they're finally
dripping in deceit,

21:26.154 --> 21:28.287
I'll pounce!

21:29.723 --> 21:31.812
-That's your plan?
-It's a great plan.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.163
He's starting to wake up.

21:35.206 --> 21:37.948
So, tell me, you two...

21:37.992 --> 21:40.168
now that you're living
together...

21:41.387 --> 21:43.780
...any thoughts about progeny?

21:43.824 --> 21:45.347
-The band?
-Kids?

21:47.175 --> 21:48.611
I don't think we're...

21:48.655 --> 21:50.483
ready for kids just yet, Dad.

21:50.526 --> 21:52.615
You're both in your 30s.
Clock's ticking.

21:52.659 --> 21:54.313
Ticktock.

21:54.356 --> 21:57.359
I'm 28, but thanks for that.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.753
Ah, 28. [chuckles]

21:59.796 --> 22:02.669
That's awfully young
for a private investigator.

22:02.712 --> 22:07.282
Well, perhaps you could
help me solve a case.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.938
The case of the baby
who wasn't there.

22:10.981 --> 22:13.244
Or was he?

22:13.288 --> 22:15.290
It might be a she.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.552
Dad...

22:16.596 --> 22:18.946
I demand to see my grandchild.

22:18.989 --> 22:22.123
Whoa, okay. Uh, "grandchild"?

22:22.166 --> 22:26.910
Uh, look, Dad, no one is hiding
a grandchild from you.

22:26.954 --> 22:29.522
Okay, a-and I resent
that accusation.

22:29.565 --> 22:31.001
[John crying]

22:33.700 --> 22:36.703
-Dad, I've decided
to tell you something.
-Mm.

22:36.746 --> 22:38.792
So it's true.

22:38.835 --> 22:40.402
You wanted me out
of your life so badly

22:40.446 --> 22:41.664
you didn't want to tell me
about your girlfriend

22:41.708 --> 22:43.013
or your child.

22:43.057 --> 22:46.495
No. That's not it, at all.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.497
Eve's not my girlfriend,
she's my roommate.

22:48.541 --> 22:50.151
Yes!

22:50.194 --> 22:51.457
[coughing]

22:51.500 --> 22:54.721
And the baby's hers, not mine.

22:54.764 --> 22:57.027
And we're just living
together to save money.

22:57.071 --> 23:00.379
The life of a P.I. might
sound glamorous, but the harsh--

23:00.422 --> 23:01.858
Eve.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.166
Why didn't you just
tell me the truth?

23:05.209 --> 23:08.125
If you're short of cash, I could
just give you some money.

23:08.169 --> 23:09.257
Here we go.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.302
And, also, what did you expect

23:11.346 --> 23:12.565
dropping out of Harvard?

23:12.608 --> 23:14.480
This is why I didn't tell you.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.307
Because I knew
you'd just judge me

23:16.351 --> 23:18.397
and tell me how I should be
living my life.

23:20.050 --> 23:21.922
And I've had enough of that.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.759
A toast to the new baby.

23:39.156 --> 23:41.071
What the hell's going on?

23:41.115 --> 23:42.856
Why are you suddenly
blocking me out of your life?

23:42.899 --> 23:44.640
Why are you suddenly
trying to be a part of my life?

23:44.684 --> 23:46.468
What is that supposed to mean?

23:46.512 --> 23:48.905
Means we haven't been close
in a long time, Dad.

23:48.949 --> 23:51.168
Let's just accept that.

23:51.212 --> 23:53.170
I'm never gonna be the person
that you wanted me to be,

23:53.214 --> 23:54.433
and you're never
gonna understand

23:54.476 --> 23:56.130
why I don't want
to be that person.

23:56.173 --> 23:57.261
We just...

23:57.305 --> 23:58.872
We have different values.

23:58.915 --> 24:00.308
Boy...

24:00.351 --> 24:01.962
that much is certain.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.616
What's that supposed to mean?

24:03.659 --> 24:05.313
You missed your
grandfather's funeral.

24:05.356 --> 24:06.793
[sighs]

24:06.836 --> 24:09.535
He had everything planned
to the last detail.

24:09.578 --> 24:11.580
And you missed it!

24:11.624 --> 24:13.408
The police send-off.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.844
Daphne's toast.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.455
Bulldog's "Ave Maria."

24:18.805 --> 24:20.589
What possible excuse
can you have

24:20.633 --> 24:22.156
for not being there
with your family?

24:22.199 --> 24:23.549
I don't have one.

24:23.592 --> 24:26.552
I-I was about to get
on the plane

24:26.595 --> 24:28.423
and then I was thinking
about Grandpa and I...

24:28.467 --> 24:30.817
and I just couldn't do it.

24:31.818 --> 24:33.341
[sighs]

24:34.603 --> 24:37.127
You remember when my buddy
died in a fire downtown?

24:37.171 --> 24:39.390
Yes, of course. Horrible.

24:39.434 --> 24:42.524
Yeah, well, we were more
like brothers t-than friends

24:42.568 --> 24:46.528
and I was friends with
his girlfriend, too, and...

24:46.572 --> 24:48.661
they were about to have a kid.

24:50.445 --> 24:52.534
Eve and her baby.

24:52.578 --> 24:56.103
I was just so angry.

24:56.146 --> 24:58.061
You know, why him and not me?
He has a family and...

24:58.105 --> 25:00.411
I know, it's...

25:00.455 --> 25:02.805
textbook survivor guilt,
but I, uh...

25:04.198 --> 25:06.243
I was in a bad place.

25:06.287 --> 25:08.071
Well, why didn't you
reach out to me?

25:08.115 --> 25:10.160
I've always told you, you can
call and talk to me anytime.

25:10.204 --> 25:12.075
Grandpa got on a plane.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.819
He flew out to see me and we...

25:16.863 --> 25:19.039
We talked about some friends
that he'd lost on the force

25:19.082 --> 25:22.825
and how he'd gotten
through it, and I just...

25:22.869 --> 25:25.393
I didn't feel alone anymore.

25:26.394 --> 25:28.048
You felt alone.

25:32.356 --> 25:35.098
You know, why don't we
open that gift.

25:47.328 --> 25:50.374
"This flag was flown
over the state capitol

25:50.418 --> 25:52.420

"for his service to the nation

25:55.205 --> 25:58.426
and his beloved city
of Seattle."

26:02.778 --> 26:04.693
I'm gonna miss him.

26:04.737 --> 26:06.869
Me, too.

26:08.088 --> 26:10.177
He was a hell of a guy.

26:11.221 --> 26:14.137
-Tough act to follow.
-[chuckles softly]

26:15.138 --> 26:19.229
If there's anything I've ever
wanted to be in life,

26:19.273 --> 26:22.319
more than anything else,

26:22.363 --> 26:25.366
it's to be a good father.

26:26.541 --> 26:28.064
Sorry I let you down.

26:29.675 --> 26:31.720
I promise I'll do better.

26:34.854 --> 26:37.291
Thanks, Dad.

[knocking]

26:48.519 --> 26:50.826
Hey. What's with the champagne?

26:50.870 --> 26:52.654
We are celebrating.
I've taken a job at Harvard

26:52.698 --> 26:54.351
and I found a place to live.

26:54.395 --> 26:55.701
-Amazing. Good for you.
-Oh, so you're actually staying?

26:55.744 --> 26:57.180
That's terrific.

26:57.224 --> 26:58.529
And even better,
it's not too far from here.

26:58.573 --> 27:00.357
-Wow, really?
-Even more terrific.

27:00.401 --> 27:02.490
Yes, yes. Come on, it's
a short walk, I'll show you.

27:02.533 --> 27:03.578
We can toast my new apartment.

27:03.622 --> 27:04.623
Now, let me see.

27:04.666 --> 27:07.277
Got to get this right. We...

27:07.321 --> 27:08.757
step out the door,

27:08.801 --> 27:11.630
there's a short walk, yes,
and here we are.

27:15.068 --> 27:16.504
Come on in.
Furniture's on the way.

27:16.547 --> 27:18.549
Not bad, eh?

27:18.593 --> 27:20.029
You're renting the apartment
next to mine?

27:20.073 --> 27:23.293
Renting? No, no, I bought
the whole building.

27:25.774 --> 27:27.341
What? How?

27:27.384 --> 27:29.430
With money, Frederick,
lots and lots of money.

27:29.473 --> 27:33.477
Okay, uh, I'm starting to have
some serious doubts about this.

27:33.521 --> 27:35.262
I understand, I understand,
but this will be good.

27:35.305 --> 27:36.611
For the both of us.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.874
I-I don't know...

27:38.918 --> 27:40.397
That's the spirit.

27:40.441 --> 27:43.052
And I don't want a silly hallway
separating us,

27:43.096 --> 27:44.967
that's why Eve and John are
going to live in that apartment

27:45.011 --> 27:46.665
and you are going to live
in this one with me.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.101
-What?
-I kind of love
the way things are.

27:48.144 --> 27:49.450
No, I-I don't think so.

27:49.493 --> 27:51.191
If you both agree
to this arrangement,

27:51.234 --> 27:52.671
you can live here rent-free.

27:52.714 --> 27:53.759
-You have a deal, we both agree.
-Still a no.

27:53.802 --> 27:55.543
Come on, let's look around.

27:55.586 --> 27:56.979
We don't agree.

27:58.154 --> 27:59.547
We don't agree!
