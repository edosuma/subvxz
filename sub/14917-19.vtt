WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:03.800
Come on, guys. We've gotta get a move on.

00:05.190 --> 00:07.500
What is that?
Peanut butter.

00:07.500 --> 00:08.880
Mom, we're a peanut-free school.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.920
I know, but Justin ate all the turkey.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.980
So just tell your teacher that it's soy butter.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.380
Mom, turkey's my favorite.

00:14.380 --> 00:19.820
I know, honey, but listen, Justin and Rebecca broke up, and
that'shat people do when they break up... they eat a lot.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.220
Cooper, why are you not dressed?

00:22.220 --> 00:26.020
Because I can't find my sweatshirt, and uncle Tommy's hogging the bathroom.

00:26.020 --> 00:27.600
I told him to use the downstairs bathroom.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.920
You know, I feel like I'm running a hotel for criminals and lonely hearts.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.400
It must be in the laundry.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.430
You scared the living daylights out of me.

00:36.430 --> 00:37.430
Is that Rebecca?

00:37.430 --> 00:38.230
Can I have some privacy, please?

00:38.230 --> 00:40.180
Can I have my kid's clothing, please?

00:40.180 --> 00:40.960
Take it.

00:40.960 --> 00:41.880
Thank you.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.730
Look, I just need my transcripts, all right? I'm trying to get into school.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.880
Okay, for the fifth time, it's Justin Walker.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.750
I can't find my phone.

00:53.750 --> 00:54.820
Mom, we gotta go.

00:54.820 --> 00:56.470
I know, honey. Did you see my cell?

00:54.640 --> 00:56.540
Yeah, of course they're not letting up.

00:56.540 --> 00:58.840
This is Holly's idea of a wet dream.

00:58.840 --> 00:59.940
Hey, Tommy.

00:59.940 --> 01:00.870
Sorry.

01:00.870 --> 01:03.730
I just don't understand why Ojai's coming after me and not her.

01:03.730 --> 01:07.410
Her whole involvement in the company is based on fraud.

01:07.410 --> 01:09.290
She told us her daughter was an heir.

01:09.290 --> 01:11.220
She misled our family.

01:11.220 --> 01:12.510
Have you seen my phone?

01:12.510 --> 01:14.360
I'm on the phone with my lawyer, all right?

01:13.220 --> 01:14.730
Well, excuse me. I'm sorry.

01:14.580 --> 01:16.800
No, I am not taking a damn plea.

01:16.800 --> 01:17.710
Hey, Tommy.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.050
Language, please.

01:19.050 --> 01:19.790
Mom, it's fine.

01:19.790 --> 01:21.140
He says "damn" all the time.

01:21.140 --> 01:22.380
No, no, no, no. Screw that.

01:22.380 --> 01:23.960
I am not giving up without a fight.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.080
No way.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.440
Is that my phone?

01:28.290 --> 01:29.870
I need my phone.

01:29.870 --> 01:30.890
Please, please, just a minute.

01:30.890 --> 01:31.760
No, I won't do it.

01:31.270 --> 01:33.230
Great. This is just great.

01:35.380 --> 01:40.310
Tommy and Julia have made it perfectly clear, they
don't want my help, so fine, I'm gonna respect that.

01:40.310 --> 01:41.230
Well, wow.

01:41.230 --> 01:42.010
Wow, mom.

01:42.010 --> 01:42.690
You know what?

01:42.690 --> 01:43.600
I'm very proud of you.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.730
It sounds like you've developed some boundaries.

01:46.150 --> 01:49.740
Let me tell you, when your son is charged
with embezzling from the family business,

01:49.740 --> 01:53.150
it does make you pause and rethink your parenting strategy.

01:53.750 --> 01:54.600
Besides that, I'm busy.

01:54.600 --> 01:59.200
The center's opening up next week, and Sarah is
coming over tomorrow to have lunch with Ryan.
Oh.

02:02.970 --> 02:04.010
Honey, I would've invited you.

02:04.010 --> 02:05.750
I just assumed you had your hands full.

02:05.750 --> 02:06.630
Well, you're welcome to come.

02:07.070 --> 02:09.650
No, you're right. I do. I do.

02:09.660 --> 02:13.390
Between the baby and Robert, I don't have time
to do anything, let alone meet a new sibling.

02:13.650 --> 02:14.660
How's he doing?

02:14.660 --> 02:16.240
Oh, Robert? Robert's fine.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.430
He's actually on the treadmill.

02:17.430 --> 02:19.310
He's on the... my God, that's amazing.

02:19.310 --> 02:20.430
Modern medicine.

02:20.430 --> 02:23.340
Kitty, I can't tell you how thrilled I am that you're doing so well.

02:23.340 --> 02:24.780
I feel so relieved.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.910
Yeah. Yeah, it's great. It's good.

02:27.910 --> 02:31.170
Oh, you know what, mom? I gotta go.
Robert just finished his workout.

02:31.170 --> 02:32.210
Bye.

02:33.580 --> 02:34.780
Well, how'd it go?

02:34.780 --> 02:35.680
He did good.

02:35.680 --> 02:41.170
Yeah, I, uh, I walked a whole quarter of a mile very slowly.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.080
You don't want to overdo it.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.720
Yeah, I'm gonna go take a shower.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.150
Ah, well, lucky you.

02:46.150 --> 02:47.120
I don't know about that.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.320
He's got a rough road ahead of him.
Yeah.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.580
I was just talking about the shower.

02:52.470 --> 02:57.240
Look, Kitty, after a heart attack, a lot of
patients get really anxious and depressed.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.570
I mean, their whole world gets turned upside down,

02:59.570 --> 03:01.220
and they've got to deal with all these new limitations... 

03:01.220 --> 03:03.260
Yeah, Robert doesn't do well with limitations.

03:03.260 --> 03:04.230
Yeah.

03:04.230 --> 03:06.660
Medication and psychotherapy could really help.

03:06.990 --> 03:09.200
I tried talking to him about it... 
Oh, let me guess.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.490
He said no.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.470
Yeah, yeah.

03:12.470 --> 03:13.640
Maybe you'd have better luck.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.080
Well, maybe. Maybe. I'll talk to him.

03:27.510 --> 03:29.110
Just a second.

03:31.870 --> 03:32.960
Oh, Ryan.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.730
Working from home, I see.

03:38.730 --> 03:40.640
Uh, I just, uh, took a personal day.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.280
And does "personal day" equal wallowing?

03:44.070 --> 03:46.200
Big-time.
Come on.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.920
You promised you were gonna snap outta this.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.950
I'm taking baby snaps.

03:49.950 --> 03:52.730
Why don't we baby snap our way right outta the apartment, huh?

03:53.670 --> 03:56.190
Ryan, I'm not feeling very fun right now...

03:56.730 --> 03:57.880
Or showered.

03:57.880 --> 04:00.650
God, you are such a girl.

04:03.730 --> 04:05.420
Ryan, what are you doing here?

04:10.580 --> 04:12.620
To get to know my new family, I guess.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.800
So there's nothing going on...

04:17.060 --> 04:18.310
Oh, with us?

04:18.560 --> 04:19.720
No. God, no.

04:19.720 --> 04:24.950
That... I... I just really enjoy talking to you, you
know, because you've gone through this with them before.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.050
Okay.

04:26.050 --> 04:28.750
If this is weird for you, I... 
No, no, I just...

04:28.750 --> 04:30.690
I just wanted to make sure, you know.

04:30.690 --> 04:32.760
Yeah, no. I totally understand.

04:34.060 --> 04:36.860
So we're cool.
Ah, totally cool.

04:37.780 --> 04:39.140
Wallow away.

04:39.410 --> 04:40.410
I'm wallowing.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.290
What are you doing right now?

04:45.290 --> 04:48.510
Just, um... cleaning up.

04:48.510 --> 04:51.110
The place looks pretty clean to me.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.090
What did you have in mind?

04:56.240 --> 04:59.670
I don't know. You know, the two of us...

05:00.630 --> 05:01.990
a free morning.

05:04.720 --> 05:05.860
It's probably a delivery.

05:05.860 --> 05:08.000
Let's just ignore that.
Okay?

05:11.230 --> 05:13.920
Wow, they really need a signature.

05:16.740 --> 05:18.180
Are we ever gonna have sex again?

05:18.180 --> 05:18.940
I don't know.

05:18.940 --> 05:21.250
I'm busy... my work, your family.

05:21.250 --> 05:22.590
Maybe we need to schedule it.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.020
What, like sex at 4:00?

05:24.020 --> 05:25.190
That's really romantic.

05:25.190 --> 05:25.840
Appointment sex.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.150
That's what married couples have to do.

05:27.150 --> 05:28.870
Yeah? Well, not this one.

05:30.350 --> 05:30.990
Haven't you heard of calling first?

05:30.990 --> 05:31.810
I can't call.

05:31.810 --> 05:34.000
Your brothers have co-opted all my phone lines.

05:34.000 --> 05:34.750
They're mine now?

05:34.750 --> 05:37.330
Listen, Kevin, I want to be a good big sister.

05:37.330 --> 05:38.110
I really do.

05:38.110 --> 05:39.490
But you gotta get 'em off my couch.

05:39.490 --> 05:43.130
Their... their crap is all over my house, and they're eating all my food.

05:43.880 --> 05:47.350
Hi, Scotty.
Hi, Sarah interruptus.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.230
There. It's in the books.

05:53.130 --> 05:54.250
You puttin' sex in the books now?

05:54.250 --> 05:56.150
No.
Yes, you are.

05:56.170 --> 05:57.210
I... yeah, thanks to you.

05:57.210 --> 05:57.980
Well, listen, I'm sorry.

05:57.980 --> 06:03.960
It's just... Justin is so depressed, he's holed up in my
laundry, and Tommy is, like, lost in a black cloud of despair.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.430
Well, he has a lot to despair about.

06:05.430 --> 06:07.630
I know, but he's cursing in front of the children.

06:07.630 --> 06:08.460
Not that I blame him.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.980
You know, this morning, his lawyer tried to get him to take a plea.

06:14.060 --> 06:15.940
Why aren't you saying sething?

06:15.940 --> 06:17.210
I agree with his lawyer.

06:18.390 --> 06:20.520
What? You want him to go to jail?

06:20.520 --> 06:21.340
No, of course not.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.690
Look, Tommy doesn't have a criminal record, okay?

06:23.690 --> 06:28.130
The judge is gonna slap him on the wrist, and
worst-case scenario, he'll do some Martha Stewart time.

06:28.590 --> 06:29.700
What if he fights it?

06:29.700 --> 06:32.330
Believe me, the last thing Tommy wants is for this to go to trial.

06:32.330 --> 06:36.150
It will go on forever, it will drain his
finances, and the judge will throw the book at him.

06:36.150 --> 06:40.380
Oh, God. You gotta talk to him.
Me?

06:40.380 --> 06:41.450
Look, his lawyer can't get through to him.

06:41.450 --> 06:42.550
What makes you think I can?

06:42.550 --> 06:44.110
Well, you just convinced me.

06:44.110 --> 06:47.750
Plus, you know, you're his brother, whom he loves and adores.

06:49.050 --> 06:50.620
I don't know, Kevin.

06:50.620 --> 06:52.560
Why don't you just take him away, you know?

06:52.560 --> 06:55.160
Just get him to chill out and relax.

06:55.160 --> 06:58.440
Maybe he'll be a little more open to suggestion.
Right.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.530
I guess I could take some time off.

07:01.530 --> 07:02.340
You can?

07:02.340 --> 07:03.860
My boss is on sick leave...

07:04.460 --> 07:06.780
as is my sex life.
Great.

07:06.780 --> 07:09.710
I mean, not your sex life, but this is great. This is good.

07:09.710 --> 07:13.630
I mean, you guys, you could have some real quality brother time.

07:13.940 --> 07:15.200
Don't push it.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.060
I don't have time to go away this week.

07:18.060 --> 07:19.880
What? Time is all you have.

07:19.880 --> 07:21.730
I have a deadline.
A deadline?

07:22.620 --> 07:24.490
All right, look, you promise not to say anything?

07:25.960 --> 07:27.290
I'm applying to school, okay?

07:27.290 --> 07:29.490
And I have a personal statement due. That's next week.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.950
Okay, when you say "school," what
do you mean? Like community college?

07:31.950 --> 07:34.320
No, it's a program to finish my B.A.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.090
Before starting med school.

07:36.760 --> 07:37.650
Oh, my God.

07:37.650 --> 07:39.210
Don't... don't... don't, because I probably won't even get in.

07:39.210 --> 07:41.620
Whoa, way to think positive. That's great.

07:41.620 --> 07:43.320
Yeah?
That really is great.

07:43.320 --> 07:46.350
You... you know what we can do? Oh, great.

07:46.350 --> 07:47.550
We can kill two birds with one stone.

07:47.550 --> 07:51.450
Let's go somewhere really quiet where you
can write, and we can both talk to Tommy.

07:51.450 --> 07:53.670
I know this great spa hotel in Palm Desert.

07:53.670 --> 07:55.000
You're not taking Scotty, all right?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.680
I don't think toy's into mud baths and cucumber water.

07:59.620 --> 08:03.030
I know where we should go.
Where? Baja.

08:04.460 --> 08:07.040
What, the place dad took us, Puerto whatchamacallit?

08:07.040 --> 08:08.640
Tommy loves that place, all right?

08:08.640 --> 08:10.460
And... and we can surf, and I can... I can do this.

08:10.630 --> 08:12.350
It's quiet. Yeah, it's quiet 'cause no one wants to go there.

08:12.350 --> 08:13.180
Go where?

08:14.510 --> 08:16.440
We were just talking about getting out of town for the weekend.

08:17.470 --> 08:20.070
Oh, nice. I just took Elizabeth to the park, 

08:20.070 --> 08:26.110
and, uh, she cried the whole time, and Julia still
won't talk to me, and you guys are planning a vacation.

08:26.110 --> 08:27.270
You should come with us.

08:27.270 --> 08:29.760
You know, the three brothers... los tres hermanos.

08:29.760 --> 08:33.620
Yeah, in case you haven't noticed, I, uh, I got a lot on my plate right now.

08:33.620 --> 08:34.870
Exact reason you should come.

08:34.870 --> 08:36.429
You know, forget about your plate, relax.

08:36.429 --> 08:39.770
It's not as if the judge put any restrictions on your travel.

08:39.770 --> 08:42.169
Yeah. I'm not exactly in the mood.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.600
Okay. L... look, I'm sorry.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.500
Justin's having real trouble getting over Rebecca.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.710
He can't even finish his application to med school.

08:55.110 --> 08:58.190
Wait. Hold on. You are... you're applying to med school?

08:58.190 --> 09:00.360
Uh, yeah, yeah. Yes, I am.

09:00.360 --> 09:03.560
And I'll... I'll tell you all about it when we... when we go to Baja.

09:06.050 --> 09:07.370
Puerto Rosa?

09:07.960 --> 09:09.470
Well, we haven't been down there in years.

09:10.420 --> 09:11.570
Years, bro.

09:11.570 --> 09:12.730
Or we can try somewhere new.

09:12.730 --> 09:13.700
Why would we go somewhere new?

09:13.700 --> 09:16.960
We can surf, we can eat lobsters at nigh.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.250
Come on. Say it.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.570
Baja. Baja.

09:23.450 --> 09:24.600
What the hell?

09:24.600 --> 09:25.910
Let's go to Baja.

09:25.910 --> 09:30.660
Yes!
Yay. Baja.

09:34.180 --> 09:36.200
What do you mean, he's out of town?

09:36.200 --> 09:40.480
Well, I want him to call me the minute he gets
in, and tell him thanks for clearing it with his boss.

09:40.480 --> 09:45.250
Hey, I'm, uh, I'm gonna try to grab a shower.
Evan's sleeping. Can you keep an ear out?

09:45.250 --> 09:46.990
Yeah. Did you know that your brother was out of town?

09:46.990 --> 09:52.050
Yeah, he took, uh, Tommy and Justin to Baja to, uh, try and cheer them up.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.270
Well, how long is he gonna be down there?

09:53.270 --> 09:55.630
Probably not long.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.950
Look, I really think you should take a look at these.

10:02.790 --> 10:07.220
Ah. "S.S.R.I. use in heart patients."

10:08.190 --> 10:09.070
Did Adam give you this?

10:09.070 --> 10:11.040
No, Adam told me to talk to you.

10:11.040 --> 10:15.400
I did all the printing by myself, which is a
feat considering I'm so tired, I can barely read.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.980
Well, I could've saved you the energy because I'm gonna be fine,

10:18.980 --> 10:22.400
and I want to feel the way I feel without the use of pharmaceuticals.

10:23.330 --> 10:26.730
And you should know that my health
records would be made public in a campaign.

10:26.730 --> 10:29.150
Oh, Robert. Nobody cares.

10:29.710 --> 10:31.850
Antidepressants? A heart attack?

10:31.850 --> 10:33.820
I might as well give mysel electric shock therapy while I'm at it.

10:33.820 --> 10:36.010
Adam asked me to broach the subject. I broached.

10:36.010 --> 10:39.170
What you do with the information now is entirely up to you.

10:40.290 --> 10:41.890
I will go get your medication.

10:41.890 --> 10:43.810
No, I... I can get my own medicine.

10:43.810 --> 10:44.620
Okay, great.

10:44.620 --> 10:48.530
Well, then I guess I have an appointment with a bottle of shampoo.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.130
And I guess I'll reschedule.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.650
Kevin thinks Justin needs a little bit of brother time.

11:02.650 --> 11:04.110
I probably do, too.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.670
So, uh, we're headed down to Baja.

11:06.970 --> 11:09.490
I didn't want you to think I just disappeared.

11:10.710 --> 11:12.360
I love you, Julia.

11:13.010 --> 11:15.480
I'll call when I get back. Bye.

11:16.390 --> 11:17.670
Wow, got enough water?

11:17.670 --> 11:19.030
We're not going to the Sahara desert.

11:19.030 --> 11:20.490
No, we're going to Baja thanks to you.

11:20.490 --> 11:22.610
Yeah, well, you were the one who opened your mouth about med school.

11:22.610 --> 11:23.760
Got him out of the house, didn't it?

11:23.760 --> 11:26.180
Yeah, except for the fact, now he keeps
grilling me about it. It makes me nervous.

11:26.180 --> 11:27.520
Would you rather we talked about Rebecca?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.790
No, I'd rather we talk about the plea... the whole point of this trip.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.400
Let's just get there first, okay? The whole point is he relaxes.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.940
So maybe you could help with that.

11:33.940 --> 11:35.470
Dr. Walker.

11:36.550 --> 11:37.820
I'm not a doctor yet, Tommy.

11:37.820 --> 11:40.180
So, uh, how old are you gonna be when they let you out?

11:40.180 --> 11:42.160
Dude, you make it sound like I'm going to prison.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.430
I'm sure he didn't mean that.
I didn't mean that.

11:46.430 --> 11:48.740
Yeah. It's fine. Don't worry about it.

11:50.300 --> 11:52.150
How's that relaxing?
It's not.

11:52.150 --> 11:54.830
Mom, you gotta check this out. You won't believe this.

11:54.830 --> 11:56.000
What?
Guess what.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.460
Look. We've both got the same lumpy elbow.

11:58.460 --> 12:01.130
The infamous William Walker lumpy elbow.

12:01.130 --> 12:03.180
Dad always said that it was a sign of wisdom.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.530
Well, yeah, it's extra padding, you
know, for long hours of contemplation.

12:06.530 --> 12:08.290
Yeah, well, I wouldn't know about that.

12:08.290 --> 12:10.650
I don't have time to contemplate anymore.

12:10.650 --> 12:15.240
I'm too busy taking care of my kids, not to mention my adult brothers.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.810
Elbows she got from her dad.

12:16.810 --> 12:18.450
Caretaking she got from me.

12:18.450 --> 12:19.250
Thanks for that, mom.

12:19.250 --> 12:22.700
Even though, these days, I'm trying to dial it back.
Very good.

12:22.780 --> 12:24.180
Hello. Hey.

12:24.180 --> 12:27.040
Oh, my God. Kitty. I didn't realize you were...
Shh.

12:27.040 --> 12:31.760
Oh, is he asleep?
Oh, look oh, it's my boo-boo.

12:31.760 --> 12:34.290
Honestly, he's making my ovaries ache.

12:35.550 --> 12:38.490
Ryan, this is Kitty. Kitty, this is Ryan.

12:38.490 --> 12:40.020
Hi.
Hi.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.390
Even though she usually looks a lot better than this.
Mom, come on.

12:43.390 --> 12:47.880
She looks like any new mother, minus the
baggy belly and the exploding breasts.

12:47.880 --> 12:51.990
Well, either way, it's... it's really nice to
finally meet you and your... your little guy.

12:52.300 --> 12:53.750
It's really nice meet you, too.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.620
What a surprise. I thought you were too busy.

12:55.620 --> 13:00.040
I was, and then... and then Evan just got so colicky, so
I just decided to drive, I threw him in the car.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.520
It usually calms him down.

13:01.520 --> 13:04.070
And we ended up here.

13:04.070 --> 13:05.520
All the way from Santa Barbara?

13:05.520 --> 13:07.800
Well, yeah. He was really fussy.

13:07.970 --> 13:09.850
Well, he doesn't look fussy now.

13:09.850 --> 13:11.240
Well, that's because it worked.

13:13.010 --> 13:15.750
And plus, I... I really wanted to meet Ryan.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.570
I mean, unless there's not enough food. I don't want to impose.

13:17.570 --> 13:20.240
No, no. Oh, no. I'm thrilled you're here. I'm thrilled

13:20.620 --> 13:24.500
All right. Well, cool. You know, I'm gonna go put Evan
down. And do you think maybe you could wash this for me?

13:24.500 --> 13:26.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That'd be great. Thanks.

13:30.260 --> 13:35.230
Uh, Ryan, would you mind setting the table while mom and I finish up lunch?
Okay.

13:35.850 --> 13:39.050
What are you doing?
That is not a colicky baby.

13:39.050 --> 13:41.730
Do you really believe she drove all the way up here to meet Ryan?

13:41.730 --> 13:45.960
My God. We practically had to put a gun
to her head to get her to meet Rebecca.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.650
Well, it's a lot easier the second time.

13:47.650 --> 13:50.130
I'm telling you, something is going on with her.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.250
Mom, nothing's wrong with Kitty.

13:51.250 --> 13:55.700
Just because Tommy's in trouble doesn't mean
you have to start inventing it for Kitty.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.630
What happened to dialing it back?

13:57.630 --> 14:01.610
All right, I'm dialing it back. I'm dialing it back.

14:01.610 --> 14:02.930
Seriously, guys, this isn't it.

14:02.930 --> 14:03.870
No, this is it.

14:03.870 --> 14:05.400
Well, what about all those hotels back there?

14:05.400 --> 14:06.460
I don't remember any of this.

14:06.460 --> 14:08.070
So it's a little bit more developed.

14:08.070 --> 14:08.900
Just calm down, all right?

14:08.900 --> 14:13.600
Remember? He would do this every single time... think
that we were lost all the way from the car to the beach.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.060
It drove dad nuts.

14:15.540 --> 14:19.130
Well, I just want to thank you guys for... for talking me into this, all right?

14:19.130 --> 14:20.350
This is exactly what I needed.

14:20.350 --> 14:24.190
This weekend is all about surfing and lobster and, um...

14:24.190 --> 14:25.690
boobs.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.910
Oh, my God.

14:31.710 --> 14:33.070
What are all you guys doing here?

14:33.070 --> 14:34.210
It's spring break, bitches!

14:37.110 --> 14:38.470
You're kidding me.

14:40.720 --> 14:41.860
All right.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.840
What have we done?

14:49.080 --> 14:50.770
Okay, I can call the Coronado or the Ritz.

14:50.770 --> 14:53.770
I mean, I'm sure we won't get an ocean
view, but we could be there in two hours.

14:53.770 --> 14:54.970
What? We just got here.

14:54.970 --> 14:57.060
Guys, this is a disaster yeah.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.800
As much as I'd love to stay, I have a lot of work to do. I think we should go.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.100
Look, guys, we're staying for one night.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.090
Besides, I don't want to spend the rest of the time in the car.

15:03.090 --> 15:04.870
Come on. This is our place.

15:04.870 --> 15:05.650
Not anymore.

15:06.300 --> 15:10.380
What are you talking about? The surf is great, and I never got to do spring break.

15:10.380 --> 15:11.470
You didn't miss a thing, believe me.

15:11.470 --> 15:12.770
Yeah, I'm talking to Justin.

15:12.770 --> 15:16.150
Besides, there are girls here who are literally going wild.
Exactly.

15:16.150 --> 15:18.960
How's he supposed to concentrate on his personal statement?

15:20.340 --> 15:22.440
Look, a weekend of this, you'll forget Rebecca ever existed.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.230
I mean, that's the whole point, right?

15:24.230 --> 15:26.610
Ac... actually... yeah, that's exactly the point.

15:26.610 --> 15:28.920
I mean, you know, you're sad, and we want to get you in a better mood.

15:28.920 --> 15:33.610
I just think, you know, we need to bond, spend some
quality time together, and this isn't the environment.

15:33.610 --> 15:35.330
What are you talking about? This is the perfect environment.

15:35.330 --> 15:38.610
I'm getting us drinks. Virgin for you. Let the bonding begin.

15:40.990 --> 15:43.870
I hate you.
I hate me, too.

15:45.950 --> 15:47.600
Thank you so much. This is really delicious.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.870
Oh, good, good. Glad you enjoyed it.

15:50.770 --> 15:54.490
Kitty, you must have a lot of questions for Ryan.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.020
I do?

15:58.020 --> 16:00.360
You came all this way to meet him.

16:00.360 --> 16:06.580
Yeah, of course, but I don't want to... I don't want to
bombard him the minute he sits down at the table, mother.

16:06.580 --> 16:08.710
Oh, it's okay. You can ask me whatever you want.

16:08.710 --> 16:10.620
Okay, um...

16:10.620 --> 16:12.100
Do you have a girlfriend?

16:13.120 --> 16:14.660
Or a boyfriend.
You know what, Ryan?

16:14.660 --> 16:18.680
If they get to be too no, you can just tell them to, um, shut up.

16:18.680 --> 16:19.640
Oh, yeah. Anytime.

16:19.640 --> 16:20.600
No. It... it's okay.

16:20.600 --> 16:25.430
I just... growing up, we had this rule... no religion, politics or sex at the table.

16:25.430 --> 16:28.050
Oh, don't worry. We hardly ever have sex at the table.

16:28.050 --> 16:31.550
Sarah.
Come on, look, you've got older sisters now.

16:31.550 --> 16:34.000
For better or worse, we pry.

16:34.000 --> 16:34.940
Right, Kitty?

16:34.940 --> 16:36.070
Yeah,we pry. We pry.

16:36.070 --> 16:41.730
It's just that I'm, um, way out of practice because I
haven't had an adult conversation in, like, what, three weeks?

16:41.730 --> 16:43.160
What about your husband?
Mom.

16:45.060 --> 16:49.370
Well, um... besides my husband.

16:51.800 --> 16:55.110
Ryan, you didn't answer my question.

16:55.110 --> 16:59.130
Um, okay. I'm straight and unattached.

16:59.130 --> 17:01.100
See, that wasn't so hard, was it?

17:01.100 --> 17:02.290
What about your major?

17:02.290 --> 17:06.099
I haven't declared yet, but I'm thinking
either political science or american studies.

17:06.099 --> 17:09.609
Political science. Politics, Kitty. You two have something in common.

17:09.609 --> 17:12.290
Well, that depends, mom. Are you a fascist?

17:12.569 --> 17:14.880
Definitely not.
Good. One for our side.

17:14.880 --> 17:18.180
Kitty, she just called you a fascist. Come on, defend yourself.

17:18.180 --> 17:23.010
Oh, no. You know, I'm... I'm... I'm actually way too tired to defend myself.

17:23.010 --> 17:25.890
I'm gonna go make a pot of coffee.

17:31.530 --> 17:34.280
You can't tell me you don't think she's acting weird.

17:34.280 --> 17:37.380
She's a new mother. She's exhausted.

17:37.380 --> 17:41.000
Something's wrong.
Yeah, with your dial. It's completely broken.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.990
Look at them all. They're like... rabbits in heat.

17:49.570 --> 17:51.890
Right, can we just get this over with so I can
go back to the room and work in peace, please?

17:52.200 --> 17:54.200
Fine. Look, when he gets back, we'll bring it up.

17:54.940 --> 17:59.980
Hey, guys. Anybody want a margarita? It's only 5 bucks.

17:59.980 --> 18:03.300
Uh, I'm... I'm good, thanks.
You know what? Maybe later. Thank you.

18:06.700 --> 18:08.330
You know, there was a time we would've loved this.

18:08.330 --> 18:11.210
Well, I'm sober now, and you're just... old.

18:11.210 --> 18:14.130
Thanks. Like appointment sex doesn't make me feel ancient as it is.

18:14.130 --> 18:15.580
I don't even want to know what appointment sex is.

18:15.580 --> 18:16.570
No, you don't.

18:16.570 --> 18:20.550
Hey, guys. Kevin, you hold these. Justin, I got you a present.

18:20.550 --> 18:23.610
You owe me big. They're staying at our hotel.

18:23.610 --> 18:26.790
Aw, Tommy.
What? We...

18:28.020 --> 18:31.930
Kevin, uh, this is Hanna, Tessa and Sabrina. This is Kevin.

18:31.930 --> 18:34.320
Hi. Hi.
This... this is Justin.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.300
Hi, Justin.
Hi.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.160
All right, sit down.

18:41.270 --> 18:44.010
Who's the best brother in the whole world, huh?
Yeah, you're a prince among men.

18:44.010 --> 18:49.000
So let's get wasted! Spring break, baby!
Awesome.

18:55.330 --> 18:59.660
You okay?
What?

18:59.660 --> 19:01.750
I... I was just making sure you were okay.

19:01.750 --> 19:06.880
Well... well, yeah. No, yeah. Oh, my gosh.

19:06.880 --> 19:14.130
I just... I... I came in, I... I put the... the coffee on, and then
I guess I put my head down, and I... I... I guess I fell asleep.

19:14.130 --> 19:18.050
Oh, it's fine. I'm sor... I'm really sorry,
again, I'll, uh, you know what? I'll get the coffee.

19:18.050 --> 19:21.140
Oh,well,how--how long
have I been sleeping?

19:21.140 --> 19:23.890
I mean,what is everybody
doing? Is--is evan awake?

19:23.890 --> 19:27.690
Yeah, don't worry about him. They're in there
making goo-goo noises and cute faces at him.

19:27.690 --> 19:29.440
Like what they did to you.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.910
You said it, not me.

19:32.880 --> 19:37.430
Do you want milk or sugar?
Uh, uh, no. I like it black.

19:37.430 --> 19:40.400
But no, no, no, you seriously do not have to serve me. I'm... 
Oh, it's okay.

19:40.400 --> 19:46.000
I have plenty of experience, and I've heard that you've had
a rough couple of weeks, so you should probably take it easy.

19:46.000 --> 19:51.610
Thank you.
I'm sorry if I was acting weird earlier. I just...

19:51.610 --> 19:55.710
Well, to be honest with you, I was pretty nervous about meeting you.

19:55.710 --> 20:01.620
You know, you're somewhat of a celebrity and
your husband's a senator... which is cool.

20:01.620 --> 20:04.690
You're not a republican. I could tell by the pause.

20:04.690 --> 20:07.590
A democrat occasionally, but I usually vote green.

20:10.090 --> 20:11.250
Oh, God, you're so young.

20:11.250 --> 20:19.370
Yeah, I guess it is young, which means it hasn't been corrupted by the capitalist
hegemony yet, which gives me an ability to see things in a different perspective.

20:19.370 --> 20:23.950
Do you, um, seriously want to argue politics with me?

20:23.950 --> 20:28.300
Well, you are talking to someone who's aced every
single political theory course in the department.

20:28.590 --> 20:34.050
All right. Bring it on.
Bring it on.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.360
Really? 100%?

20:36.410 --> 20:37.990
Yep, gay as a tangerine.

20:38.140 --> 20:40.210
So have you ever tried it with a girl?

20:40.950 --> 20:45.120
Tried and succeeded very well, thank you.
Oh, my God. I think I love you.

20:45.230 --> 20:46.040
Oh, look.

20:46.060 --> 20:47.630
Shot hottie!

20:47.740 --> 20:49.120
Shot hote!

20:50.630 --> 20:51.680
You're up.

20:54.370 --> 20:55.240
Tilt your head back.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.760
Open wide.

20:59.660 --> 21:00.580
And...

21:00.800 --> 21:01.880
swallow!

21:06.640 --> 21:07.600
She your girlfriend?

21:08.200 --> 21:09.430
Not my type.

21:11.860 --> 21:12.810
Well, then I bet I am.

21:15.580 --> 21:18.100
That was really cruel to do to a married man.

21:18.130 --> 21:19.030
That was hot.

21:19.150 --> 21:22.650
I would pay so much money to watch you guys make out.
Great.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.260
I'm an extra in a gay porn film.

21:24.400 --> 21:27.180
All right, guys. Here we go. Drinks.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.080
Justin, you know what? You should talk to Tessa.

21:29.230 --> 21:30.610
You know, she's in med school.

21:31.600 --> 21:32.780
You're in med school, really?

21:32.810 --> 21:34.480
It's premed, actually.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.740
Tommy says you're working on your admission essay.

21:36.780 --> 21:37.970
When is it due?

21:38.920 --> 21:39.950
This week.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.320
Does that mean you want us to leave you alone?

21:43.480 --> 21:45.720
He needs to loosen up, have a little bit of fun, huh?

21:47.650 --> 21:48.720
Tessa!

21:50.260 --> 21:51.100
Who's that?

21:51.230 --> 21:55.220
That is Van, the neanderthal I've been meaning to dump for weeks.

21:55.290 --> 21:58.270
I'm kind of a chicken when it comes to that sort of stuff.

22:00.770 --> 22:03.530
Hey, you've just been through it. Any helpful breakup hints?

22:03.660 --> 22:07.060
Uh, I... I was the dumpee, not the dumper.

22:08.850 --> 22:09.690
Come on, ladies.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.710
The Van has honked his horn.

22:11.860 --> 22:14.470
Bye. Bye.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.950
What is wrong with you? She was cute, man.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.730
I'm not looking, okay?

22:21.800 --> 22:24.000
This is a stupid way to get over Rebecca.

22:24.150 --> 22:26.830
That is how you get over Rebecca.
Enough about Rebecca.

22:26.850 --> 22:28.740
Let's just give him a moment, okay?

22:29.050 --> 22:31.760
Look, I know you're heartbroken... 
I'm not heartbroken, okay?

22:32.350 --> 22:34.310
You know what, Tommy? You're the one that should be heartbroken, all right?

22:34.330 --> 22:35.850
Your wife just threw you out.

22:36.210 --> 22:37.780
I'm just trying to help you, man.
Help me?

22:38.370 --> 22:39.810
This trip isn't about helping me.

22:39.820 --> 22:41.770
You're the reason why we're here, Tommy.

22:43.650 --> 22:44.940
What's that supposed to mean?

22:47.960 --> 22:48.960
Ask Kevin.

22:52.610 --> 22:54.410
You want me to get the shot guy over?

22:55.680 --> 22:59.750
So not only do you have a problem with capitalism
and government, now you have a problem with family?

22:59.790 --> 23:04.440
Well, come on. Family is just a... a social construct
set up to protect property and consolidate power.

23:04.460 --> 23:05.570
That is sentimental.

23:05.580 --> 23:07.110
And historically accurate.

23:07.380 --> 23:08.730
Mom is hogging your child.

23:08.740 --> 23:10.650
How long does it take to make a cup of coffee?

23:10.670 --> 23:12.890
Well, a lot less time than it does to convince our younger,

23:12.910 --> 23:16.780
naive brother that not everything in the world is a capitist conspiracy.

23:16.890 --> 23:19.350
Oh, you're taking on my sister already? I like you more and more.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.240
Well, you haven't heard his argument yet.

23:21.310 --> 23:24.470
Well, I'm just trying to say that our modern ideas about having kids and... 

23:24.490 --> 23:27.500
and marriage and parenthood are just social constructs.

23:27.560 --> 23:32.240
Okay, listen, Mr. Green party, I'm sorry, but there
is nothing that is going to convince me that

23:32.250 --> 23:37.820
there's not something natural and inherently human
about loving and caretaking your family.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.990
Case in point... Evan.

23:40.140 --> 23:44.530
Okay, I look at that baby... I... there's nothing political or intellectual.

23:44.540 --> 23:47.410
It's... it's... it's just... it's just love.

23:47.870 --> 23:50.160
A mother's love is not a construct.

23:50.170 --> 23:54.440
It... it... it just is, and nothing's ever gonna change that.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.430
I'm running late.
Oh, no, no.

23:57.440 --> 23:58.650
I was just getting warmed up.

23:58.720 --> 24:01.470
We can do it another time. I really... I said I'd meet a friend.

24:01.710 --> 24:02.600
Wait, Ryan.

24:03.230 --> 24:04.170
Did I say something?

24:04.180 --> 24:06.670
Look, I have to go. Will you just tell Nora I'll be back later?

24:14.540 --> 24:15.500
Ryan,hey.

24:15.830 --> 24:17.370
I... I could use a friend right now.

24:19.260 --> 24:20.140
Come in.

24:26.970 --> 24:27.930
What happened?

24:29.130 --> 24:32.490
God, they probably think that I am the biggest
freak, but I just couldn't be there anymore.

24:32.700 --> 24:33.510
Oh, let me guess.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.520
Some big secret came out, and everyone started yelling at each other.

24:36.860 --> 24:38.160
No, I...

24:38.940 --> 24:41.610
They were fine, actually. I'm the one who has the secret.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.960
Kitty started talking about...

24:47.570 --> 24:52.230
you know, being a mother, and then I couldn't help but think about my own.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.710
Well, that's normal. I mean, you miss her.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.040
That's not it.

25:00.420 --> 25:03.850
Everybody said that she died in a car accident, but that doesn't make any sense.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.440
It was the middle of the day, and there were no skid marks.

25:06.450 --> 25:09.120
I mean, she didn't even try to put on her brakes.

25:09.740 --> 25:11.610
Sometimes accidents just happen.

25:11.800 --> 25:14.010
Yeah, that's... that's what everybody told me.

25:14.300 --> 25:16.230
But then, you know, I can't help but wonder...

25:17.100 --> 25:19.430
she... she had this affair with this guy, right?

25:19.460 --> 25:20.950
And then she had a kid.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.680
And then I start thinking that...

25:24.800 --> 25:25.710
what if...

25:27.300 --> 25:28.200
What?

25:29.410 --> 25:31.120
What if my mother killed herself?

25:33.920 --> 25:36.570
And what if William Walker is the reason she did it?

25:37.190 --> 25:41.870
And... and maybe he did something... I don't
know... maybe he broke her heart or something.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.250
Oh, my God.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.710
And that's why you're here?

25:49.770 --> 25:51.180
Yeah, I just want to...

25:52.170 --> 25:54.130
I just want to find out the truth, you know?

25:59.510 --> 26:00.600
Hi.
Hey.

26:02.100 --> 26:03.410
Uh, look...

26:03.620 --> 26:08.600
I know I shouldn't be calling, but, uh, Rebecca,
you wouldn't believe the week I'm having.

26:08.760 --> 26:10.160
Uh, yeah, I want to hear about it.

26:10.170 --> 26:13.400
It's just, um... 
Is this a bad time? 'Cause I... I mean, I can call you back.

26:13.660 --> 26:15.100
Well, how about I call you back?

26:15.270 --> 26:17.880
Ryan's here and I'm... 
Ryan's there?

26:18.240 --> 26:21.290
Yeah, he just stopped by to talk... 
That's okay. I don't want to interrupt.

26:21.300 --> 26:22.300
No, you're not interrupting.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.800
I'll talk to you later.
Justin... 

26:28.180 --> 26:30.190
So how's that personal statement coming?

26:35.020 --> 26:37.250
You know, I probably could use some help.

26:37.450 --> 26:38.300
Great.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.980
So this... this whole trip, this was about me taking a plea?

26:43.000 --> 26:43.850
Partly, yeah.

26:43.900 --> 26:45.780
But it was also for us to... 
To what?

26:45.790 --> 26:47.500
To... to bond before I get locked up?

26:47.520 --> 26:48.990
Oh, Tommy. It's not like that.

26:49.010 --> 26:51.450
I just want to know who else was in on this? Mom?

26:51.500 --> 26:53.080
No, mom had nothing to do with this.
So Sarah?

26:53.100 --> 26:54.100
No.
Sarah?

26:54.390 --> 26:55.370
A little.

26:56.250 --> 26:58.870
So what was this, some sort of intervention?
No!

26:58.880 --> 27:01.610
Oh, I bet Justin loved being on the other side of this one, huh?

27:01.620 --> 27:02.430
Okay, you know what?

27:02.440 --> 27:07.820
Things are coming outta lile bit wrong 'cause I'm
actually still tipsy from those mix-in-the-mouth things.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.430
Tommy, I'm your brother, okay? I'm also a lawyer.

27:10.450 --> 27:14.850
I am telling you professionally and personally, you have a lot of evidence against you.

27:14.870 --> 27:20.540
That's interesting, 'cause as a brother and as a lawyer,
you took on the U.S. Army to get Justin out of his obligations.

27:20.550 --> 27:22.730
Yeah, and that was different.
Why was that different?

27:22.980 --> 27:24.390
'Cause it was Justin?
No.

27:24.400 --> 27:25.600
I mean, how many times has he screwed up?

27:25.610 --> 27:28.250
Yet this family is still willing to go to the mat for him.

27:28.400 --> 27:29.220
What about me?

27:29.300 --> 27:30.120
What have I done?

27:30.340 --> 27:33.660
I've tried to protect the business, all right, the family's future.

27:33.670 --> 27:35.650
I know. I know that. I know that.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.570
But if you fight this, you could lose everying.

27:37.590 --> 27:39.390
So what do you want me to do, man, just... just roll over?

27:39.400 --> 27:40.870
No, it's not about rolling over.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.550
Kevin, I have a wife and a daughter.

27:42.560 --> 27:46.820
I know, and we want what's best for them and for you.
Oh, please. You don't give a damn about me.

27:46.830 --> 27:47.640
Really?
Yeah.

27:47.650 --> 27:49.140
You think I'd be here if I didn't?

27:49.500 --> 27:53.970
Well, you've done what you came to do, so we're...

27:54.220 --> 27:55.410
we're finished here.

27:59.340 --> 28:00.810
I feel so bad.

28:00.860 --> 28:04.750
I mean, I... I really thought we were
just having a good, old-fashioned debate.

28:04.760 --> 28:06.350
I think you're reading too much into this.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.620
Oh, no. No, I'm not. You didn't see his face.

28:08.630 --> 28:10.830
He... he was... he was really upset.

28:11.560 --> 28:13.900
Well, I figured out why Evan's so quiet.

28:13.930 --> 28:16.050
He is out like a light.

28:16.060 --> 28:18.950
Oh, good. Oh, good. Thanks for double-checking.

28:18.970 --> 28:21.670
Didn't you think that Ryan was really upset?

28:22.000 --> 28:22.810
Not really.

28:22.890 --> 28:24.700
Sweetheart, would you just stop worrying about this?

28:24.710 --> 28:26.900
Kitty, honestly, I'll talk to him the minute he comes in.

28:26.930 --> 28:30.010
Oh, you know what? I always, always say the wrong thing.

28:32.810 --> 28:33.860
All right, what's going on?

28:33.890 --> 28:34.720
Mom.

28:35.920 --> 28:36.850
What?

28:37.450 --> 28:40.190
She thinks that you're keeping something from us.

28:40.390 --> 28:41.800
Are you?
No.

28:42.740 --> 28:44.690
No, I'm not keeping anything from you. I promise.

28:44.700 --> 28:45.910
No, it's just, I... 
I knew it.

28:46.090 --> 28:49.380
Something's wrong.
No, nothing is wrong. I promise. Nothing is wrong.

28:49.460 --> 28:50.360
I'm...

28:51.330 --> 28:53.920
Well, Robert... Robert is having a little bit of a difficult time.

28:53.940 --> 28:58.690
But that's very normal, for cardiac patients to
feel a certain level of depression and frustration.

28:58.700 --> 29:02.750
It's challenging sometimes to be around, but I'm... I'm fine.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.020
I don't believe you.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.970
I have to say, Kitty, this time, I don't, either.

29:09.930 --> 29:10.910
Okay.

29:11.310 --> 29:13.880
Okay, you know what? I'm... I'm not okay. I mean, I'm okay.

29:13.900 --> 29:15.650
But I'm not... I'm just... you know what?

29:15.660 --> 29:18.100
I'm really tired.

29:18.430 --> 29:20.240
I mean, I never have a chance to take a shower.

29:20.250 --> 29:24.550
I can't even tell you... I don't remember the last time that I
washed my hair, and... and don't get me wrong, I love being with evan.

29:24.710 --> 29:28.050
I love being with Evan more than anything in the world.

29:28.060 --> 29:31.980
But I do have to get up... I have to get up every
three hours and... and I have to feed him.

29:32.000 --> 29:37.570
And then I have to make Robert these... these low-sodium meals
with the saucen the side and the exact amount of protein.

29:37.620 --> 29:40.060
And you know what? He doesn't like my cooking.

29:40.230 --> 29:42.790
I can never do anything right.

29:42.800 --> 29:45.540
He... he... he really... you know what? He doesn't talk to me.

29:47.330 --> 29:48.640
You know, I think I'm...

29:49.600 --> 29:50.920
I'm lonely.

29:59.310 --> 30:00.560
You're a new mother.

30:00.590 --> 30:03.690
It would be hard even if you didn't have a sick husband.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.220
You should've told us, Kitty.

30:05.260 --> 30:06.710
Why didn't you ask for help?

30:06.720 --> 30:09.390
Oh, I don't know. You know, the whole situation with Tommy,

30:09.420 --> 30:13.490
I just... and you just thought I was
so happy, and I... I just... I feel embarrassed.

30:13.500 --> 30:18.070
I mean, I... I should be happy, so... 
Well, you don't have to pretend to be happy for me, ever.

30:18.650 --> 30:22.270
I know.
I... look, I was trying to dial it back, and I shouldn't have.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.190
Sorry.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.700
Listen to me, Kitty, you're going to spend the night here tonight.

30:26.710 --> 30:29.770
No, no... 
I won't take no for an answer. Robert will be fine.

30:29.790 --> 30:33.540
I'm going to make you a nice big bubble bath. I'm going to make you dinner.

30:33.700 --> 30:38.130
You're gonna climb into that bed, and you're going to sleep as long as you need.

30:38.590 --> 30:41.410
If I wasn't so tired, I would jump for joy.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.760
You don't need to jump for joy. Just stand up.
Okay.

30:43.770 --> 30:45.550
Put one foot in front of the other.
Okay.

30:45.560 --> 30:46.530
We'll go upstairs...

30:46.540 --> 30:47.960
Good night, Sarah.

30:48.220 --> 30:49.780
Sweet dreams.

30:53.010 --> 30:54.920
I don't know, maybe I'm just fooling myself, you know?

30:54.950 --> 30:58.020
I mean, if I can't even finish the
application, how am I gonna handle school?

30:58.030 --> 30:59.930
Oh, come on. You were in Iraq.

30:59.940 --> 31:02.090
School is gonna be the easiest thing you've ever done.

31:02.100 --> 31:02.930
Trust me.

31:03.050 --> 31:04.370
I don't know. Maybe.

31:04.380 --> 31:06.470
I mean, it's all moot if I don't finish the essay anyways.

31:06.520 --> 31:09.990
Well, maybe coming down to Baja during spring break isn't the best idea.

31:10.070 --> 31:12.100
What are you... what are you talking about?

31:15.910 --> 31:18.360
I am actually starting to enjoy myself though.

31:19.070 --> 31:20.110
Me, too.

31:30.480 --> 31:31.440
Hey!

31:32.050 --> 31:32.900
You're a dead man!

31:32.940 --> 31:34.300
Oh, no.
Justin, go.

31:34.350 --> 31:35.230
I'll be fine.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

31:35.830 --> 31:37.950
Van, stop this!
Get back here!

31:38.600 --> 31:40.020
Come on, Tommy. Where are you going?

31:40.050 --> 31:41.560
You know, we're too drunk to drive.

31:41.610 --> 31:42.590
I'll take a bus.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.830
When are you gonna realize we were actually doing this for you?

31:44.900 --> 31:47.500
I don't want to hear another word from you, all right?

31:47.550 --> 31:49.060
I don't want to talk to you, either!

31:49.210 --> 31:50.560
Great, just don't talk to me quietly.

31:50.640 --> 31:51.500
What is going on?

31:51.930 --> 31:53.720
I have an entire fraternity trying to kill me.

31:53.730 --> 31:54.680
Are you kidding me?

31:54.710 --> 31:55.600
No.

31:56.670 --> 31:58.240
Wow, you guys suck.

31:58.790 --> 31:59.730
Hey, Justin!

32:00.540 --> 32:01.560
You in there?

32:05.910 --> 32:08.860
What is this? Some sort of stupid plot get me to take a plea?

32:09.020 --> 32:11.940
What, incarcerating you in a hotel room so you know what it feels like?
Guys, shh.

32:11.950 --> 32:13.780
Open the door right now! Open it!

32:13.800 --> 32:14.950
That sound like a ploy to you?

32:16.990 --> 32:18.180
All right, that's it. I'm calling security.

32:18.190 --> 32:20.910
Security? We're at a hotel in Baja. There is no security.

32:20.920 --> 32:22.580
So what are we supposed to do, sit in here and hide?

32:22.590 --> 32:23.630
Yeah, I got snacks.

32:23.640 --> 32:26.170
Oh, that's great.
You know what? We could've been in the Ritz by now.

32:26.190 --> 32:27.420
Shut up, Kevin.

32:27.860 --> 32:29.060
I hope the sex was worth it.

32:29.070 --> 32:30.970
The sex? We barely kissed.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.110
What?

32:32.160 --> 32:34.360
We're about to get our asses kicked for first base?

32:34.370 --> 32:35.780
Well, if you wouldt have pimped me out.

32:35.790 --> 32:38.980
Well, if you'd have told me what we were
doing down here, maybe... this was Kevin's idea.

32:39.140 --> 32:42.150
You know, we just wanted to get you relaxed
before we told you what was going on.

32:42.170 --> 32:45.060
Oh, well, I'm really relaxed sitting with the two of you in the dark.

32:45.070 --> 32:48.240
Justin, write your essay. You got your quiet time now.

32:48.250 --> 32:49.530
You wanna know why I can't write my essay?

32:49.650 --> 32:50.960
It's because of you.
What?

32:51.110 --> 32:54.580
You're the reason why Rebecca and I broke up.
She's the only one that believes I can actually do this.

32:54.610 --> 32:57.580
I made out with a beautiful girl tonight,
and all I could think about was Rebecca.

32:57.660 --> 32:58.670
Tommy, this trip wasn't a lie.

32:58.680 --> 33:01.080
I am completely messed up over her.

33:01.450 --> 33:03.800
All right, yeah, and I thought doing the
applications would help. But you know what?

33:03.820 --> 33:05.270
Nothing is helping me.

33:11.760 --> 33:13.590
Uh, you're supposed to have sex in five minutes.

33:13.620 --> 33:14.620
Give me that.

33:15.150 --> 33:19.060
Why did i fight appointment sex? I could be home, safe and spooning right now.

33:19.070 --> 33:21.510
Dude, I can hear you! Just open the door!

33:21.640 --> 33:22.570
What are you doing?
What?

33:22.600 --> 33:23.650
This is ridiculous.

33:23.670 --> 33:24.560
I'm gonna go talk to them.

33:24.570 --> 33:25.410
Are you insane?

33:25.420 --> 33:26.230
What?

33:26.240 --> 33:27.330
Bullies back down.

33:27.340 --> 33:28.990
Not after 20 hours of shots.

33:29.030 --> 33:31.320
If you're going out there, I'm going out
there. I'm the one who kissed her, Tommy.

33:31.330 --> 33:33.780
No, you're going to med school, all right?

33:36.000 --> 33:37.170
I'm going to jail.

33:39.800 --> 33:43.040
You... you were right, Kevin. I...

33:44.070 --> 33:45.630
I've screwed everything up.

33:45.670 --> 33:50.650
And I should probably take the plea, and I'm running out of options.

33:53.810 --> 33:55.140
But I can fix this.

33:55.840 --> 33:58.800
And that's what big brothers are supposed to do, so just...

33:59.600 --> 34:00.680
just let me.

34:04.910 --> 34:06.170
Tommy, come...

34:12.590 --> 34:15.090
You look good.
Oh, well, thank you.

34:15.230 --> 34:17.290
Sorry. I... I should've called.

34:19.550 --> 34:22.440
I'm gonna completely... overstep here.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.610
It's none of my business.

34:25.679 --> 34:26.980
But I'm worried about Kitty.

34:29.719 --> 34:31.380
I'm worried about you and Kitty.

34:32.690 --> 34:36.400
Well, I didn't see this at first, but...

34:36.659 --> 34:41.650
Robert, when she talks about you now, she's a little detached, a little...

34:42.340 --> 34:43.370
clinical.

34:44.469 --> 34:46.130
Well... she's coping.

34:46.190 --> 34:47.510
Or she's pulling away.

34:48.340 --> 34:51.540
I've seen her do it, right before she left for New York.

34:51.739 --> 34:54.989
You know, she and my mother used to have these terrible, knockdown fights.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.590
They couldn't be in the same room together.

34:56.620 --> 35:00.130
And then it came a point where Kitty just stopped arguing.

35:00.280 --> 35:03.000
She grew very quiet, very polite.

35:03.330 --> 35:07.330
We were all so relieved, that we didn't realize that she had just...

35:08.350 --> 35:09.920
distanced herself.

35:10.580 --> 35:12.000
And then she left.

35:14.210 --> 35:15.160
Well...

35:15.630 --> 35:19.210
I appreciate your concern, and...

35:19.450 --> 35:22.160
I don't think you should make assumptions about the marriage.

35:22.280 --> 35:24.780
I'm not making assumptions. I know my sister.

35:25.670 --> 35:30.430
For Kitty, arguing is... is her way of expressing love, passion.

35:31.010 --> 35:32.200
When she pulls away...

35:32.210 --> 35:33.650
But she's not pulling away.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.470
See, I know Kitty. She's tired.

35:38.040 --> 35:40.370
She's got a lot on her plate. And...

35:41.800 --> 35:44.480
you know, we have been going through some stuff, but...

35:46.220 --> 35:47.230
she's adjusting.

35:47.250 --> 35:50.060
Or she's so angry, she doesn't want to fight anymore.

35:50.090 --> 35:51.580
What would she be angry about?

35:52.970 --> 35:56.670
That I'm running for governor or that I've had a heart attack?

35:56.850 --> 35:59.860
I'm not saying anyone's at fault.

36:01.210 --> 36:02.810
I just thought you'd want to know.

36:06.660 --> 36:07.890
Can you hear anything?
Nothing.

36:07.900 --> 36:09.660
Oh, we gotta get out there.

36:11.350 --> 36:13.010
It's just me, you morons.

36:13.210 --> 36:14.770
You okay.

36:14.790 --> 36:15.850
What happened?

36:15.910 --> 36:18.900
It's all good. Uh ,situation handled.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.170
Did you even get a punch in?

36:22.870 --> 36:24.190
You should see them.

36:26.910 --> 36:27.940
Fine.

36:28.340 --> 36:29.920
I got my ass kicked.

36:31.590 --> 36:32.500
You know what?

36:33.100 --> 36:33.930
I kind of envy them.

36:34.010 --> 36:35.280
Who, Van?

36:35.980 --> 36:38.700
All of them... the spring breakers. It's...

36:39.720 --> 36:40.570
it's all ahead of them.

36:40.730 --> 36:44.130
What, alcohol poisoning, D.U.Is and S.T.Ds?

36:44.180 --> 36:46.930
No, seriously. I mean, no major screwups yet.

36:47.180 --> 36:49.210
They're just... they're just starting out.

36:49.490 --> 36:55.260
I mean, imagine if you could just start over, a clean slate.

36:55.910 --> 36:57.360
That'd be nice.

37:00.580 --> 37:06.230
There was this kid... after graduation... 
he was really smart, Valedictori, and he just...

37:06.870 --> 37:09.750
He just took off, went to Costa Rica, went surfing.

37:09.850 --> 37:10.780
You know what I did?

37:11.060 --> 37:13.600
I went to work with Ojai Foods.

37:15.870 --> 37:17.270
I think about it all the time.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.840
Why didn't I just go to Costa Rica?

37:21.140 --> 37:23.520
Well, if we're starting over, um...

37:24.170 --> 37:25.380
I'd choose Paris.

37:27.480 --> 37:28.870
Am I allowed to take Scotty?

37:29.080 --> 37:30.390
At least you have someone to bring.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.370
Justin, you love her.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.030
Fight for her.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.370
All right? Don't let my mess screw that up, please.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.100
You know, I finally feel like we're on vacation.

37:45.190 --> 37:49.150
The only thing we're missing is dad telling us to go
to bed so he can wake us up at 5:00 a.m. to go surfing?

37:50.840 --> 37:53.300
You guys mind not reminiscing about dad?

37:55.710 --> 37:58.340
I've made a lot of mistakes following in his footsteps.

37:59.930 --> 38:01.620
I need to make some new footsteps.

38:02.960 --> 38:05.340
So what you said before about the plea?

38:05.390 --> 38:06.250
I meant it.

38:08.960 --> 38:12.880
But right now, I just want to be here with you guys.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.960
Oh. There you are.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.270
Yes, oh, I could just eat you.

38:28.280 --> 38:29.750
Eat you with pie.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.390
Baby? La mode.

38:35.680 --> 38:36.810
Okay, mother.

38:37.390 --> 38:38.200
You gotta give him up.

38:38.250 --> 38:40.030
Oh, no.
I know.

38:40.040 --> 38:43.260
No, no, no.
I know, I know, but we really have to go.

38:43.750 --> 38:45.180
All right.

38:45.780 --> 38:46.700
There you go.

38:46.710 --> 38:48.610
Hi, sweetie boy.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.280
Oh, I was missing you terribly.

38:56.480 --> 38:58.600
Oh, mom. Thank you.

38:59.940 --> 39:04.570
I really, really needed the sleep, and I... I really needed the shower.
Yes.

39:05.100 --> 39:06.460
And I really needed you.

39:07.130 --> 39:12.190
Ah, well, there's no statute of limitations on
needing your mother, even when you are a mother.

39:12.330 --> 39:14.510
Yeah, you're right.

39:14.910 --> 39:15.860
You.

39:15.900 --> 39:19.050
Okay, next time, don't be so subtle, all right, Kitty?
Okay.

39:19.060 --> 39:20.470
I mean, get on the phone. Call me.
Okay.

39:20.480 --> 39:22.790
Say, get your butt up here. I need you.
Okay.

39:23.100 --> 39:25.840
Hi.
Hey, I just wanted to see how you're doing.

39:26.260 --> 39:27.860
I'm good. And you?

39:27.950 --> 39:28.940
Oh, you know, well,

39:28.970 --> 39:30.740
I got out of the house at least, which is good.

39:30.750 --> 39:33.940
You should see all the work I have piled up on my desk.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.450
You working all day, or can you take a break?

39:36.460 --> 39:38.960
You thinkin' lunch?
I'm thinking lunch.

39:39.000 --> 39:39.810
Great.

39:40.590 --> 39:42.420
Oh, hi. My name's Kevin Walker.

39:42.470 --> 39:45.460
I was wondering if I could schedule an appointment for later this evening.

39:46.580 --> 39:48.210
Look at that. An appointment just opened up.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.600
Shall I pencil you in, Mr. Walker?

39:49.670 --> 39:51.690
Yes,please.I love you.

39:51.720 --> 39:53.160
Oh,love you,too,scotty.

39:53.170 --> 39:54.690
Oh, Justin loves you, too.

39:54.700 --> 39:55.510
See you tonight.

39:55.520 --> 39:56.710
Okay, bye.

39:57.220 --> 39:58.220
I ordered a pot of coffee.

39:58.230 --> 39:59.540
Oh, that's great news.

40:00.150 --> 40:02.020
You look like hell. Did you sleep at all?

40:02.100 --> 40:03.130
No, not really.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.780
I just kept thinking about what Tommy said about starting over.

40:06.820 --> 40:10.300
And all of a sudden, I knew what my essay was gonna be about.

40:10.680 --> 40:12.480
I pretty much finished my draft last night.

40:12.650 --> 40:14.130
Congratulations.

40:15.470 --> 40:17.170
That was a weird night, huh?

40:17.220 --> 40:19.240
Definitely one for the record books.

40:19.370 --> 40:20.300
Where's Tommy?

40:20.740 --> 40:21.880
Uh, he's still in bed.

40:21.950 --> 40:23.570
I figured he'd earned a little extra sleep time.

40:23.580 --> 40:24.690
Definitely.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.570
You think he's gonna take the plea?

40:30.330 --> 40:31.300
Yeah ,I do.

40:38.290 --> 40:40.240
Oh, hey, honey. We're back.

40:40.300 --> 40:41.290
Hey.

40:41.340 --> 40:42.930
How was your mom's?
Oh, it was great.

40:42.950 --> 40:45.740
I got a full night's sleep, and I feel like a new person.

40:45.750 --> 40:47.330
Good. I'm glad you got some sleep.

40:47.380 --> 40:48.630
Yeah, me, too.

40:48.840 --> 40:51.310
I'm gonna go make Evan a bottle before he starts howling.

40:51.380 --> 40:52.280
No, I... I can do it.

40:52.300 --> 40:54.300
No, that's okay. I can do it.

40:55.010 --> 40:55.880
Okay.

40:56.020 --> 40:58.480
Oh, thank you for the information.

40:59.550 --> 41:00.570
No, it was just Google.

41:00.580 --> 41:03.540
Yeah, but you, you know, you took the time to do it, and I read it.

41:03.580 --> 41:06.430
You know,and I know I need to do something to manage my...

41:07.410 --> 41:10.780
Stress, but I do think, for the time being, I'm just gonna do my own thing.

41:11.050 --> 41:11.880
Good.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.650
You know, it's entirely up to you, and I'm sure you'll make the right decision.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.210
Tommy!

41:22.270 --> 41:23.550
Wake up. We brought you coffee.

41:23.670 --> 41:24.940
Wakey-wakey.

41:25.600 --> 41:26.410
Tommy.

41:35.730 --> 41:36.570
Oh, no.

41:36.690 --> 41:37.830
What?

41:39.220 --> 41:41.860
I'm sorry I can't go back with you. Please give the envelope to Julia.
