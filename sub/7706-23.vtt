WEBVTT

00:05.072 --> 00:06.772
Ha. Ha. Ha.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.245
I can see myself in this
coffee pot, can I go now?

00:13.247 --> 00:15.948
Not until you can see
yourself in the silverware.

00:15.950 --> 00:19.785
Who's coming to dinner?
The smudge police?

00:19.787 --> 00:21.653
They're my college roommates.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.689
I know, I know.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.091
Rent a sense of humor, will ya?

00:26.093 --> 00:29.028
ALF, I only have these people
over once every four years

00:29.030 --> 00:31.797
and I don't like you
ridiculing my efforts.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.732
Fine, from now on

00:33.734 --> 00:36.168
I'll be a "Yes" alien.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.202
[knocking on door]

00:37.204 --> 00:38.871
Coming!

00:38.873 --> 00:41.306
(Willie)
'Hurry up, Kate,
we got groceries.'

00:41.308 --> 00:42.908
We can't let you in.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.244
We just polished the doorknob.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.278
ALF!

00:50.151 --> 00:52.384
Wow! Look at that sign!

00:52.386 --> 00:53.919
What sign?

00:53.921 --> 00:54.953
Ah-h!

00:57.191 --> 00:58.223
(Kate)
'ALF?'

00:59.627 --> 01:01.560
What?

01:01.562 --> 01:04.763
[theme music]

01:31.592 --> 01:34.793
[music continues]

02:04.358 --> 02:06.792
[instrumental music]

02:09.663 --> 02:11.964
When? How?

02:11.966 --> 02:14.666
Why did you do this?

02:14.668 --> 02:16.301
Half an hour ago.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.436
Crayon.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.304
Seemed like a good idea.

02:20.741 --> 02:24.343
Well, it's not coming off.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.712
Maybe they won't notice.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.013
They won't notice..

02:28.015 --> 02:30.949
...because they won't
be coming here.

02:30.951 --> 02:32.985
If I were the paranoid type

02:32.987 --> 02:35.254
I'd think this had
something to do with me.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.958
Hello, Betty?
Uh, listen, it's Kate.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.862
Um, uh, I'm afraid we can't
get together here tonight.

02:43.864 --> 02:47.266
Uh, my decorator got
a little carried away.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.870
No, no, no, no,
I still wanna get together.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.373
Uh, how about if we
meet...on campus

02:54.375 --> 02:56.308
at the Summa Cum Lately?

02:56.310 --> 02:57.442
Yeah, it's still there.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.111
I here it's Cajun now.

02:59.113 --> 03:00.546
Same time would be great.

03:00.548 --> 03:03.448
Listen, will you call Maura?
I'll call Sylvia.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.517
Okay. Yeah. Well, see you then.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.052
Bye-bye.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.555
Best we can do is
to paint over it.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.356
You're gonna cover that up?

03:11.358 --> 03:13.892
That's like covering
up a Rembrandt

03:13.894 --> 03:16.094
or a Winchell's billboard.

03:16.931 --> 03:19.431
We're painting over it.

03:19.433 --> 03:22.801
I think I got some more
of that beige in the garage.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.404
Beige? Now there's
a commitment to color.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.173
It'll be beige, ALF.

03:28.175 --> 03:30.409
And if you interfere in any way

03:30.411 --> 03:33.145
you maybe hearing the buzz
of a Lady Remington.

03:35.716 --> 03:39.218
[instrumental music]

03:39.220 --> 03:40.852
(female #1)
'Waiter,
could I have a margarita?'

03:40.854 --> 03:41.954
(female #2)
'Make that a pitcher.'

03:41.956 --> 03:43.922
(waiter)
'Coming right up!'

03:43.924 --> 03:46.425
Now, tell me what
have you guys been up to?

03:46.427 --> 03:48.493
Well, we haven't been
trying cases

03:48.495 --> 03:51.029
before the state supreme
court like some people.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.464
Yeah, congratulations.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.799
Next thing you know
you'll be confirmed

03:53.801 --> 03:55.000
as Chief Justice.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.835
Not a chance. I smoked marijuana

03:56.837 --> 03:58.237
once during the sixties.

03:58.239 --> 03:59.338
[laughing]

03:59.340 --> 04:01.506
Now, tell me what
have you been up to?

04:01.508 --> 04:04.776
Same old thing. I'm still
selling houses on the Westside.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.145
Yeah, yeah.
Number one in sales again.

04:07.147 --> 04:09.715
They gave her a Cadilac
to match her blazer.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.184
Yeah, but beige is
so non-committal.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.218
Oh.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.953
I've heard that.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.990
And what about you, Sylvia?

04:17.992 --> 04:20.525
Sold the card shop,
bought a stationary store.

04:20.527 --> 04:21.994
Sold that, bought a paper mill.

04:21.996 --> 04:24.062
Sold that, bought a forest.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.898
That's fantastic!

04:26.900 --> 04:29.735
- And what are you up to, Kate?
- Nothing.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.137
Well, uh, no, not nothing.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.339
I'm still a wife and mother.

04:34.341 --> 04:37.209
I have to stay home
and watch the children.

04:37.211 --> 04:39.177
I thought Brian
was in school now.

04:39.179 --> 04:42.681
He is. She means stay home
and watch all my children.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.716
Well, a family of five..

04:44.718 --> 04:46.218
...or, in my case, four

04:46.220 --> 04:48.453
or any number for that matter..

04:48.455 --> 04:50.555
...is quite a responsibility.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.958
Boy, sometimes I wish
I'd gone that way.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.827
The whole thing just
seems so alien to me.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.896
Yeah, that's another thing.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.599
You know, we have got to
get to the airport.

05:00.601 --> 05:01.833
- Oh, I know.
- 'Oh.'

05:01.835 --> 05:03.235
Look, what are the
chances of y'all

05:03.237 --> 05:04.503
flying up to Portland next year?

05:04.505 --> 05:05.937
- Slim.
- None.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.706
Never mind. I'll come down.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.074
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.109
- Bye.
- Bye, sweetie.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.045
I can't believe it,
I missed the whole party.

05:13.047 --> 05:14.846
- Bye, sweetie.
- See you later.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.048
- So short!
- Once a year.

05:16.050 --> 05:18.083
It's like two minutes.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.251
- See you next year.
- See you, guys.

05:19.253 --> 05:21.186
- Yeah, next year.
- Next year.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.122
Oh.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.757
Maura, I-I've got
to go in a minute too.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.560
But, uh...I just
wanna tell you..

05:29.830 --> 05:33.298
...how proud we are of you and..

05:33.300 --> 05:36.568
...how much I respect
what you have accomplished.

05:38.539 --> 05:41.139
[sobbing]

05:42.376 --> 05:44.976
Gee, I meant that
as a compliment.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.311
Oh, Kate.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.747
Kate, I can't go home.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.049
Well, honey, why?
What's happened?

05:51.051 --> 05:53.685
John and I have had
a really terrible fight.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.920
Oh.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.323
Can I stay with you tonight?

05:58.325 --> 05:59.925
Uh...no.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.462
Uh, you know what

06:03.464 --> 06:05.464
no, I-I mean of course.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.833
- You can stay...with me.
- Oh, thank you.

06:07.835 --> 06:08.867
Uh..

06:08.869 --> 06:10.335
Oh, l-look, l-let me make just a

06:10.337 --> 06:12.938
real quick phone call, okay?

06:12.940 --> 06:15.407
And, um, I'll be right back.

06:23.917 --> 06:27.119
[telephone rings]

06:30.858 --> 06:32.657
Hello.

06:32.659 --> 06:35.460
Dad, it's for you. It's mom.

06:35.462 --> 06:38.430
Go ahead, Willie.
I'll hold the brush.

06:38.432 --> 06:41.967
Well, okay,
but don't paint with it.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.668
I won't.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.670
Um, don't eat it.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.776
He didn't say not to lick it.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.744
It's implied.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.979
Rats!

06:55.983 --> 06:57.115
Hello?

06:57.117 --> 06:58.884
Oh, hi, honey, it's me.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.285
Hi, Kate, what's the matter?

07:00.287 --> 07:02.020
[sighs]
Uh, well, nothing really.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.990
But I'm here with Maura and
she wants to spend the night.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.158
(Willie)
'Here?'

07:06.160 --> 07:08.260
Uh, yes, um..

07:08.262 --> 07:10.095
Uh, she just had a
big fight with John

07:10.097 --> 07:12.030
and she's very upset,
I'd like to help her out.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.965
'But can we manage it?'

07:13.967 --> 07:16.034
Well, the sign's almost covered.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.303
'All we have to do
is hide the artist.'

07:20.340 --> 07:24.276
Okay. We'll be home
in about, uh, 30 minutes.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.178
She can sleep on the couch.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.612
Well, that should be no problem.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.681
(ALF)
Whoa!

07:29.683 --> 07:30.715
(Brian)
ALF!

07:35.322 --> 07:37.522
How would she feel about
sleeping on the floor?

07:39.927 --> 07:41.159
Oh.

07:42.596 --> 07:45.397
Well, at least
I didn't get any on me.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.268
[instrumental music]

07:57.144 --> 07:59.544
Works for me.

07:59.546 --> 08:03.148
Thank you for the ALF
housekeeping seal of approval.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.184
I'll be going to the garage now.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.053
No, you won't.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.522
I won't be going
to the garage now.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.991
Where will I be going?

08:12.993 --> 08:16.461
You will be sleeping
in Brian's room tonight.

08:16.463 --> 08:19.030
I don't wanna sleep
in Brian's room.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.399
His Smurf clock offends me.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.173
You will be sleeping
in Brian's room.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.142
I will be sleeping Brian's room.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.545
Even though his
Smurf clock offends me.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.383
(Kate)
'Well here we are Maura.'

08:38.385 --> 08:39.885
ALF.

08:39.887 --> 08:41.353
I'll be in Brian's room

08:41.355 --> 08:44.155
along with that
grinning blue idiot.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.959
I'll just, uh, open the lock

08:47.961 --> 08:50.695
and...in we go.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.231
Fine, Kate. Go ahead.
Whatever you say, I'm ready.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.233
- Hi!
- Hi, Willie.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.402
- Hi, Maura.
- Willie.

08:57.404 --> 08:58.970
Hi, it's so nice to see you.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.806
Welcome to our humble abode.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.675
Thanks for taking me in.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.844
Oh, I hope this isn't
an inconvenience.

09:05.846 --> 09:10.081
No, not at all. Well, I hope you
don't mind sleeping on a bed.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.349
[chuckles]

09:11.351 --> 09:13.985
Uh, normally,
there's a couch there

09:13.987 --> 09:16.521
but, um...we're
having it cleaned.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.690
And burned!

09:18.692 --> 09:21.760
Well, listen, I'm just
really glad to be here.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.828
Uh, I'll go
get an extra blanket.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.297
Thanks, honey.

09:26.300 --> 09:29.100
So would you like to call John

09:29.102 --> 09:30.335
let him know you're alright?

09:30.337 --> 09:32.537
What, and ruin his evening?

09:33.373 --> 09:36.107
Why don't I make us some tea?

09:36.109 --> 09:38.009
Oh, Lynnie,
you know Mrs. Norris.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.711
Of course, how are you?

09:39.713 --> 09:42.581
Lynnie! I don't believe it.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.349
Oh, is this that same
little girl that

09:44.351 --> 09:46.151
used to drool
on my law books?

09:46.153 --> 09:47.586
Well, I've developed a greater

09:47.588 --> 09:49.454
respect for the law since then.

09:49.456 --> 09:52.223
And since I read your
arguments in People v. Fusco.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.092
You actually read
those arguments?

09:54.094 --> 09:55.360
Oh, sure!

09:55.362 --> 09:56.895
Maura, what do you
take in your tea?

09:56.897 --> 09:58.263
Usually bourbon.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.531
Ha ha ha.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.835
[instrumental music]

10:11.812 --> 10:12.844
Hi!

10:13.947 --> 10:15.180
Uh-oh!

10:17.618 --> 10:19.351
Nice try though.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.986
Huh?

10:20.988 --> 10:23.855
Oh, come on, Sammy.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.024
Did you honestly think
that you could fool me

10:26.026 --> 10:27.792
with that silly disguise?

10:27.794 --> 10:29.094
Sammy?

10:29.096 --> 10:30.862
Sammy who?

10:30.864 --> 10:32.797
What do you mean Sammy who?

10:32.799 --> 10:34.265
Sammy you!

10:35.736 --> 10:36.835
You know me?

10:36.837 --> 10:38.903
Of course.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.438
Now, quit fooling around.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.841
Come over here, sit down,
have a drink.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.478
Well, maybe a short one.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.849
[instrumental music]

10:54.488 --> 10:56.287
[instrumental music]

10:57.157 --> 10:58.590
Now, you realize that I'm just

10:58.592 --> 11:00.458
a figment of your imagination

11:00.460 --> 11:03.628
and not an alien from
another planet, right?

11:03.630 --> 11:05.664
Of course.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.098
Just checking.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.500
Well, gotta run!

11:08.502 --> 11:10.735
I've got other dreams
to appear in.

11:10.737 --> 11:12.337
Oh, knock it off, Sammy.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.406
You're not going anywhere.

11:14.841 --> 11:15.940
I'm not?

11:15.942 --> 11:18.943
No, we've been through
all this before.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.413
By the way,
that is the strangest

11:21.415 --> 11:23.481
I've ever seen you look.

11:24.418 --> 11:26.618
You should see me in a tank top.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.221
This even beats
the time you showed up

11:30.223 --> 11:32.590
as the dog in the cowboy suit.

11:34.461 --> 11:37.562
How often do I show up?

11:37.564 --> 11:39.531
You arrive during
the third margarita

11:39.533 --> 11:41.733
and leave sometime
during the blackout.

11:42.636 --> 11:44.803
Well, at least I'm consistent.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.271
Yeah. Here.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.274
<i> Salud.</i>

11:50.143 --> 11:51.376
[sniffing]

11:51.378 --> 11:53.445
Holy owned and operated!

11:53.447 --> 11:56.214
- What is this stuff?
- What do you mean what is it?

11:56.216 --> 11:59.551
We've been drinking tequila
together for seven years.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.486
Well, did I ever ask
what's in it?

12:01.488 --> 12:05.356
No. You just always said that it
tastes better than it smells.

12:05.358 --> 12:08.293
Well, let's hope so.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.495
Well, at least
there's a worm in it.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.734
[screeching]

12:17.671 --> 12:18.603
[exhales]

12:18.605 --> 12:20.839
- I was wrong.
- About what?

12:20.841 --> 12:24.042
[gasps]
This tastes worse
than it smells.

12:25.045 --> 12:28.046
[gasping]

12:30.717 --> 12:33.718
[ALF groaning]

12:36.890 --> 12:38.323
[thudding]

12:38.325 --> 12:40.558
Willie, what's that?

12:40.560 --> 12:42.393
Well, I don't, I don't know.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.329
It sounds like..

12:44.331 --> 12:47.031
...an alien groaning
and groping his way

12:47.033 --> 12:49.534
along the walls of our hall.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.603
That's what I thought.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.539
[groaning]
Oh!

12:54.541 --> 12:56.174
ALF, what are you doing?

12:56.176 --> 12:57.208
[groaning]

12:57.210 --> 12:59.878
Groaning and groping

12:59.880 --> 13:03.081
and looking for a place
to do the Technicolor yawn.

13:06.353 --> 13:07.585
What's the matter?

13:07.587 --> 13:09.954
I've been poisoned, Willie.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.422
Earth germs.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.792
I saw it in
"War Of The Worlds."

13:13.794 --> 13:16.761
Before aliens can
destroy the planet..

13:16.763 --> 13:18.963
...the Earth germs get 'em.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.599
What are you talking about?

13:21.601 --> 13:24.903
Well, my tongue feels hairy.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.071
Your tongue is hairy.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.406
What did you eat?

13:28.408 --> 13:31.242
Just the usual, everything.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.178
It's what I drank.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.779
(Kate)
'What did you drink?'

13:34.781 --> 13:36.981
I think they call it tequila.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.518
ALF!

13:41.621 --> 13:43.822
You have a hangover!

13:45.025 --> 13:46.958
You shouldn't be drinking.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.960
Hey, I'm over 21.

13:49.896 --> 13:52.497
I'm over 221.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.333
You got into the liquor cabinet?

13:55.335 --> 13:59.237
No, Maura got into
the liquor cabinet.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.706
You saw her? She saw you?

14:01.708 --> 14:04.709
Yeah, yeah, now we're
seeing each other.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.878
But I don't think
it's gonna work out.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.880
She's a booze hag.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.750
That is not true!

14:12.752 --> 14:14.552
And I will not have
you or anyone else

14:14.554 --> 14:16.120
insulting my friends that way.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.155
Do you hear me?

14:17.157 --> 14:19.157
Oh, boy, do I!

14:22.596 --> 14:24.796
This isn't a criticism, Willie.

14:24.798 --> 14:27.098
But your wife's voice seems

14:27.100 --> 14:30.001
unusually grating this morning.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.739
I can't believe<i> you</i>

14:34.741 --> 14:37.942
and Maura got drunk together.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.178
Yeah.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.446
And now she thinks I'm her

14:41.448 --> 14:43.381
imaginary drinking buddy.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.551
Who appears after she's
had half of fifth.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.052
Which must be a tenth.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.788
Ow, ow, math hurts.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.292
Drinking..

14:54.294 --> 14:56.027
...it's not good.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.729
Well, tell me about it.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.565
I'm off the sauce forever.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.601
It's that hooch-monger
you have to worry about.

15:03.603 --> 15:08.206
Will you stop
insulting Kate's friend?

15:09.309 --> 15:10.975
Well, what would you call her?

15:10.977 --> 15:14.145
Her name is Maura.
It's always been Maura.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.547
Except in college
when we called her..

15:18.285 --> 15:19.751
...boilermaker.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.621
She played ball for Purdue?

15:25.725 --> 15:27.592
[sighs]

15:27.594 --> 15:30.929
She drank 14 boilermakers
in one night.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.033
I guess we thought that
was funny at the time.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.670
ALF.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.905
I would like to apologize
for losing my temper

15:40.907 --> 15:44.742
if you will apologize to me
for what you said about Maura.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.746
Apology accepted and given.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.149
Now, if you'll excuse me

15:51.151 --> 15:53.952
I have to drive
the porcelain bus.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.119
[retching]

15:58.692 --> 16:00.558
Is he really that hung over?

16:00.560 --> 16:01.793
[ALF retching]

16:05.332 --> 16:06.564
Apparently.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.233
Uh, maybe we ought to go

16:09.235 --> 16:11.769
see what sort of shape
Boilermaker is in.

16:11.771 --> 16:15.106
I-I mean Maura.
What shape Maura is in.

16:15.108 --> 16:18.242
Boilermaker?
Did you say "Boilermaker?"

16:18.244 --> 16:21.379
Yeah, that's what
we called her in college.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.581
[ALF retching]

16:25.385 --> 16:27.251
Why did you call her that?

16:28.521 --> 16:31.022
Because she drank too much.

16:31.024 --> 16:34.492
And let's face it, Kate,
she still does.

16:34.494 --> 16:38.396
You mean you think that
she's an alcoholic?

16:38.398 --> 16:40.631
I don't know, um..

16:40.633 --> 16:42.834
...I think you
should talk to her.

16:42.836 --> 16:46.571
But, honey, she's so successful
and motivated and--

16:46.573 --> 16:47.805
Miserable.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.675
Yeah.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.210
[ALF retching]

16:53.546 --> 16:55.780
(ALF)
'I don't remember eating that.'

16:55.782 --> 16:57.982
[instrumental music]

16:59.552 --> 17:00.952
So what's the main attribute

17:00.954 --> 17:03.454
for a lawyer facing
the Supreme court?

17:03.456 --> 17:05.690
A lack of ethics.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.191
And shiny shoes.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.326
[laughs]

17:08.328 --> 17:11.796
I'm sorry. It's a little
too early to talk shop.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.699
Well, maybe a little Lynnie.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.100
How early is it anyway?

17:16.102 --> 17:17.702
Mmm, 7:30.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.504
[groaning]
Oh.

17:19.506 --> 17:20.571
- Hi, guys.
- Good morning, Maura.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.040
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

17:22.042 --> 17:23.941
Oh, dad, could you
drop me off at school?

17:23.943 --> 17:25.877
- Julie's car broke.
- What do you mean broke?

17:25.879 --> 17:27.979
You mean she got a flat tire?

17:27.981 --> 17:30.982
No, dad. One of the flange
gaskets is leaking gas

17:30.984 --> 17:33.518
onto the intake manifold.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.353
I stand corrected.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.789
We-we'll be on our way
just as soon as I, uh..

17:37.791 --> 17:39.424
...finish my screwdriv--

17:39.426 --> 17:41.292
I mean my orange juice.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.595
Would you like some
breakfast, Maura?

17:44.597 --> 17:46.631
Oh, thanks, Kate, I'm having it.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.800
How about some tomato juice?

17:48.802 --> 17:50.735
Plain tomato juice?

17:51.538 --> 17:53.037
Yeah.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.072
Pass.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.679
We got to go, Lynn, um..

18:01.681 --> 18:03.714
Great to see you again, Maura.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.049
- Thanks, Willie.
- Gosh!

18:05.051 --> 18:07.118
I hope everything
works out for you.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.419
Okay.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.054
Goodbye, Mrs. Norris.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.656
It was so great seeing you.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.957
Oh, same here, Lynnie.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.259
Oh, I have so much
respect for you

18:15.261 --> 18:18.162
and I would really like
to be like you someday.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.765
[sobbing]

18:20.767 --> 18:22.266
- What's wrong? What'd I say?
- It's okay.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.669
- No, it's nothing.
- Is she okay?

18:26.573 --> 18:27.805
Oh.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.276
Rough night last night, huh?

18:32.278 --> 18:34.278
Oh, no rougher than usual.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.749
You mean nothing
strange happened?

18:39.719 --> 18:40.852
Uh, you-you slept okay?

18:40.854 --> 18:42.053
I mean you didn't, uh

18:42.055 --> 18:43.921
hear anything or see anything?

18:43.923 --> 18:45.289
What are you getting at, Kate?

18:45.291 --> 18:47.758
Nothing. I just wondered.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.727
Yeah-uh, if you slept okay?

18:49.729 --> 18:51.796
Fine, I slept fine.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.334
Maura, I-I..

18:56.336 --> 18:58.736
...I don't know exactly
how to say this, but..

18:59.873 --> 19:02.273
...are you aware of
how much you drink?

19:03.877 --> 19:06.344
Well, I drink, but
no more than anybody else.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.112
I can certainly handle it.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.714
I'm not so sure about that.

19:09.716 --> 19:14.285
I think that you might have
a little problem with this.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.954
[chuckles]
Oh, Kate.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.123
Kate, I had a huge
fight with my husband.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.425
I'm under a lot of
pressure at the firm.

19:21.427 --> 19:23.027
'It helps me relax, that's all.'

19:23.029 --> 19:24.762
'I don't have
a drinking problem.'

19:24.764 --> 19:26.731
Look, Kate, I had a
few drinks last night

19:26.733 --> 19:28.466
because I was happy
to see everybody.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.868
I had one or two more here
before I went to bed

19:30.870 --> 19:33.037
but that was it!

19:33.039 --> 19:34.972
[mimicking buzzer]
Wrong!

19:35.775 --> 19:37.008
Sammy!

19:37.810 --> 19:38.976
Kate, do you see--

19:38.978 --> 19:41.412
She can't see or hear me, Maura.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.414
Only you can.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.950
I'm your drinking pal, remember?

19:48.721 --> 19:50.922
See what, Maura?
I don't see anything.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.792
There's a little
guy...right there?

19:54.794 --> 19:57.361
Yeah, go ahead, describe me.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.696
And while you're at it

19:58.698 --> 20:01.165
tell her about the
dog in the cowboy suit.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.503
Kate, there's this little man
that I see sometimes

20:05.505 --> 20:06.871
when I dream, but..

20:06.873 --> 20:09.440
...I've never seen
him in the morning.

20:09.442 --> 20:12.210
Well, I usually sleep in.

20:12.212 --> 20:15.580
Is this someone you see
after you've been drinking?

20:15.582 --> 20:17.882
Yes. Sometimes, but..

20:17.884 --> 20:21.018
Oh, well, it really doesn't
happen that often.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.120
I'll bet Kate's gonna ask you

20:23.122 --> 20:25.656
how long you've been seeing me.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.891
[fake coughs]

20:27.627 --> 20:29.026
Uh..

20:29.028 --> 20:31.629
How long has this been going on?

20:31.631 --> 20:33.664
Oh, a couple of weeks maybe.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.132
How long?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.568
A year.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.903
One year?

20:39.606 --> 20:41.072
Two or three years.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.007
- Ahem.
- Alright.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.042
Seven years.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.411
Maura.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.414
- That's a long time.
- Yeah, I know.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.585
Have you discussed
this with John?

20:54.587 --> 20:56.487
Yeah, we talk about it.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.521
[sobs]

20:57.523 --> 20:59.824
That's what we fight about.

20:59.826 --> 21:00.891
He thinks I'm an--

21:00.893 --> 21:02.226
Booze hag?

21:04.197 --> 21:05.229
Sorry.

21:06.399 --> 21:09.267
- An alcoholic?
- Yes, but he's wrong.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.534
Is he wrong?

21:10.536 --> 21:13.804
Maura, Maura, look who's here.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.773
Your imaginary drinking buddy.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.376
At 7:30 in the morning!

21:19.412 --> 21:21.512
[imitates gunfire]

21:22.582 --> 21:23.814
You wanna be stuck with that

21:23.816 --> 21:25.850
the rest of your life?

21:25.852 --> 21:27.518
No.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.121
Then why don't we call
the Betty White Clinic?

21:30.957 --> 21:32.423
Betty Ford.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.393
What?

21:36.629 --> 21:39.030
I was just thinking that..

21:39.032 --> 21:41.299
...now would be a good
time to get some help.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.301
Maura, there are
places you can call

21:43.303 --> 21:46.170
that know how to handle
this sort of thing.

21:46.172 --> 21:49.240
Honey, I just hate
to see you so unhappy.

21:50.276 --> 21:51.309
Yeah.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.979
Maybe I ought to think about it.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.281
Good.

21:57.283 --> 22:00.351
Maura, I hope you
never see me again.

22:05.625 --> 22:09.226
Wait, maybe it was
the Betty Boob Clinic.

22:15.635 --> 22:18.135
[instrumental music]

22:20.306 --> 22:21.439
ALF.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.641
Here-here's another
food catalog.

22:24.977 --> 22:27.878
Oh, the cheese log issue!

22:28.848 --> 22:30.781
Listen to this. It's from Maura.

22:30.783 --> 22:33.517
"Dear, Kate, since my visit
with you and your family

22:33.519 --> 22:36.253
"I've started to try
and rebuild my life.

22:36.255 --> 22:38.689
"It's very difficult
but I found a group of people

22:38.691 --> 22:42.393
"who are extremely supportive
so at least I'm not alone.

22:42.395 --> 22:44.662
"I'm even starting
to like the taste

22:44.664 --> 22:48.032
of plain tomato juice. Ha ha."

22:48.034 --> 22:51.102
I hate it when people write
in laughs like that.

22:52.238 --> 22:54.438
At least she didn't write
"I kill me."

22:56.442 --> 22:59.543
"I'm anxious to have you
all over to dinner soon.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.279
BYO soft drinks."

23:02.915 --> 23:04.448
Did she invite me?

23:04.450 --> 23:07.251
Oh, she didn't
mention you, Sammy.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.054
After all I did for her

23:10.056 --> 23:12.256
she pretends I don't exist.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.193
I'm sure she's grateful, ALF.

23:16.195 --> 23:17.862
But, you know,
we're the only ones

23:17.864 --> 23:20.064
who really know what you did.

23:20.967 --> 23:22.867
We owe you one.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.402
A big one?

23:24.404 --> 23:25.770
A big one!

23:25.772 --> 23:29.039
Great! Cheese log number 37.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.741
Muenster Madness.

23:30.743 --> 23:34.478
Fifty pound size, $99.95.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.613
Ha-ha!

23:35.615 --> 23:38.082
She walked right into that,
didn't she?

23:38.084 --> 23:40.284
She certainly did.

23:40.286 --> 23:43.120
- Ha-ha!
- $99.95?

23:43.122 --> 23:45.589
It's a lot of cheese.

23:45.591 --> 23:48.192
Be thankful I didn't
get the Nell Carter Ball.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.560
[laughing]
Yeah.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.261
