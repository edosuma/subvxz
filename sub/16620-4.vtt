00:19.358 --> 00:20.658
I am sore!

00:20.659 --> 00:21.943
What happened?

00:21.944 --> 00:23.494
I thought I had
a cashew in my pocket,

00:23.495 --> 00:25.580
and I was digging around
in there for like ten minutes!

00:25.581 --> 00:27.365
Kids, can you please
get back to work?

00:27.366 --> 00:29.033
Gene's injured!

00:29.034 --> 00:30.535
Hey...!

00:30.536 --> 00:31.869
What do you want, Jimmy?

00:31.870 --> 00:33.254
Notice anything
different about me?

00:33.255 --> 00:34.539
No, thank you.

00:34.540 --> 00:35.623
Eh? Eh?

00:35.624 --> 00:37.041
I'm tan!

00:37.042 --> 00:38.459
Just got back from a week
in the Bahamas.

00:38.460 --> 00:39.877
We had a blast.

00:39.878 --> 00:41.129
Except for Jimmy Jr.

00:41.130 --> 00:42.680
He forgot to put on sunblock.

00:42.681 --> 00:44.549
Now he looks like
a dog's ding-dong.

00:44.550 --> 00:45.883
Aw.
‭Yeah.

00:45.884 --> 00:47.101
We just have a ton
of money right now.

00:47.102 --> 00:49.053
Don't care.
Please leave.

00:49.054 --> 00:50.555
You know, you really do
everything wrong, Bob.

00:50.556 --> 00:51.973
You spend too much
on ingredients.

00:51.974 --> 00:53.724
You don't charge enough
for your food.

00:53.725 --> 00:55.393
You have zero karaoke.

00:55.394 --> 00:57.278
And he's got a neck
muffin top. ‭Gene.

00:57.279 --> 00:59.397
Take for example
my new meat guy.

00:59.398 --> 01:01.315
Saves me over
a thousand a month.

01:01.316 --> 01:02.400
What?
Really?

01:02.401 --> 01:04.235
Yeah, Jack Conway.

01:04.236 --> 01:06.654
I call him Jack "Saves Me Over
a Thousand a Month" Conway.

01:06.655 --> 01:08.072
Well, listen, I got to go.

01:08.073 --> 01:09.407
Got to show more people my tan.

01:09.408 --> 01:11.242
Hey, look at this!

01:11.243 --> 01:13.211
New spindle thingy,

01:13.212 --> 01:15.663
straws, toilet paper.

01:15.664 --> 01:17.582
Probably should have gotten
that a long time ago.

01:17.583 --> 01:20.802
Wow, our shopping list
is really piling up this month.

01:20.803 --> 01:23.671
Hey, if we want to save money,
why don't we call that meat guy?

01:23.672 --> 01:25.807
What was his name...
Jack something?

01:25.808 --> 01:27.258
We already have a meat guy.

01:27.259 --> 01:28.726
We've been with him for years.
Demitri.

01:28.727 --> 01:30.228
Yeah, but sounds
like this other guy

01:30.229 --> 01:31.429
could help us out a little.

01:31.430 --> 01:33.064
I mean, it is just a phone call.

01:33.065 --> 01:34.065
Yeah, it's just a phone call!

01:34.066 --> 01:35.016
Just a phone call.

01:35.017 --> 01:36.434
It's a phone call!

01:36.435 --> 01:37.435
I'm glad you called.

01:37.436 --> 01:38.486
And now you're here.

01:38.487 --> 01:39.987
And now I'm here.

01:39.988 --> 01:41.939
And I'm sure I can
save you guys some money.

01:41.940 --> 01:43.941
Well, it's just
we only buy the best cuts,

01:43.942 --> 01:45.409
so I don't even
know if you can...

01:45.410 --> 01:46.944
$400.
What?

01:46.945 --> 01:48.613
Based on what
you told me on the phone,

01:48.614 --> 01:50.781
I bet I could
save you $400 a month

01:50.782 --> 01:53.000
without sacrificing quality.

01:53.001 --> 01:54.702
Four... $400?

01:54.703 --> 01:56.287
That's like $500!

01:56.288 --> 01:57.371
Does that sound good to you?

01:57.372 --> 01:58.956
(laughing):
Sounds good to me.

01:58.957 --> 02:01.292
To be honest, it-it
sounds too good.

02:01.293 --> 02:03.461
Bob, I have relationships
with several small cattle farms

02:03.462 --> 02:05.263
in Vermont and Ohio.

02:05.264 --> 02:06.964
I buy from them
at very friendly prices,

02:06.965 --> 02:09.350
and I can pass
those savings on to you.

02:09.351 --> 02:11.602
Hmm, Vermont is nice.

02:11.603 --> 02:13.938
(chuckling): Hey, hey, look,
if you start buying from me,

02:13.939 --> 02:15.473
I could take you
up there some time.

02:15.474 --> 02:17.191
It's beautiful...
the cows love dying there.

02:17.192 --> 02:19.143
Aw, I want to see!

02:19.144 --> 02:22.113
It's just I'm a little
concerned that anyone

02:22.114 --> 02:23.781
who does business
with Jimmy Pesto

02:23.782 --> 02:26.150
is maybe, um, horrible?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

02:26.151 --> 02:27.818
No offense.
Oh, no, God, ugh!

02:27.819 --> 02:29.287
(chuckles)
That guy.

02:29.288 --> 02:30.488
I mean, I understand
what you're saying.

02:30.489 --> 02:31.739
I mean, let's just say this.

02:31.740 --> 02:33.324
He is an idiot.

02:33.325 --> 02:35.793
But he has great taste
in meat distributors.

02:35.794 --> 02:37.211
And pants.
What?

02:37.212 --> 02:38.496
He has nice pants.

02:38.497 --> 02:39.797
I thought you said that.

02:39.798 --> 02:41.666
I-I never said
he has nice pants, Lin.

02:41.667 --> 02:42.967
Oh.
‭Listen.

02:42.968 --> 02:44.252
Why don't you folks just buy

02:44.253 --> 02:45.753
a small box from me today...

02:45.754 --> 02:47.922
a sampler, if you will,
a little amuse-bouche...

02:47.923 --> 02:49.757
and, uh, give it a whirl?

02:49.758 --> 02:53.060
You'll see it's the same great
quality at a lower price.

02:53.061 --> 02:55.429
"Same great quality,
lower price."

02:55.430 --> 02:57.598
Yep, same great "Q"
at a lower "P."

02:57.599 --> 02:59.566
Wow, business talk.

03:01.561 --> 03:04.238
Hmm, this meat is,
um, not great.

03:04.239 --> 03:05.439
Teddy, um, what do you think?

03:05.440 --> 03:07.491
Tastes good... mmm, mmm.

03:07.492 --> 03:10.361
Really? You-you don't think it
tastes... kind of weird?

03:10.362 --> 03:11.445
Mmm, I don't know, Bob.

03:11.446 --> 03:13.364
Eh, maybe make another one.

03:13.365 --> 03:15.283
I could tell better.
Maybe make a few.

03:15.284 --> 03:17.168
No, I don't think
this is gonna work out.

03:17.169 --> 03:18.786
I don't think I'll be
ordering again from this guy.

03:18.787 --> 03:20.254
No harm, no foul.

03:20.255 --> 03:21.455
Hello, Bob!

03:21.456 --> 03:22.623
Hugo, what are you
doing here?

03:22.624 --> 03:23.624
Hi, Ron.
‭Hi, everybody.

03:23.625 --> 03:24.625
Ron!

03:24.626 --> 03:25.626
Oh, sorry.

03:25.627 --> 03:27.044
Truth or dare, Bob?

03:27.045 --> 03:28.379
Ooh, dare!

03:28.380 --> 03:30.047
Yeah, dare Dad to kiss Teddy!

03:30.048 --> 03:32.300
On the lips this time!

03:32.301 --> 03:33.634
(groans)
You were supposed to pick truth.

03:33.635 --> 03:35.102
Your menu clearly states

03:35.103 --> 03:38.556
that you serve USDA
Prime beef... true?

03:38.557 --> 03:41.892
Uh, yes, Hugo, we do
serve USDA Prime beef.

03:41.893 --> 03:43.894
Wrong! We have photographs
of a certain vendor

03:43.895 --> 03:46.447
entering your restaurant
with a box of meat.

03:46.448 --> 03:49.734
Bob, do you know what
the term "meat fraud" means?

03:49.735 --> 03:51.736
Is it when you try to
buy something at a store

03:51.737 --> 03:53.571
but, instead of
money, you use meat?

03:53.572 --> 03:55.740
No. ‭Is it when,
instead of paying your taxes,

03:55.741 --> 03:58.025
you send the government a ham?
No!

03:58.043 --> 03:59.794
Meat fraud is the illegal
misrepresentation

03:59.795 --> 04:02.546
of one protein for another.

04:02.547 --> 04:04.298
I'm pro-teen.
Go teens!

04:04.299 --> 04:06.050
Wait, Hugo, what are you saying?

04:06.051 --> 04:07.551
I'm saying that the "beef"

04:07.552 --> 04:10.221
inside that box
wasn't beef at all.

04:10.222 --> 04:12.590
It was horse!

04:12.591 --> 04:14.175
Horse?!
‭Oh, my God!

04:14.176 --> 04:15.593
(heavy breathing)

04:15.594 --> 04:17.428
Ugh, don't feed
a guy a horse, Bobby!

04:17.428 --> 04:18.596
Calm down, it's okay!

04:18.596 --> 04:19.647
Deep breaths.

04:19.648 --> 04:21.098
(deep inhaling)
‭Deep.

04:21.099 --> 04:23.150
Okay, not like that!
(low gurgling)

04:23.151 --> 04:24.101
No.

04:24.102 --> 04:25.936
(deep gasping)

04:25.937 --> 04:27.738
That's it.
There she is.

04:27.739 --> 04:30.574
I have no other option
but to shut you down.

04:30.575 --> 04:32.576
Hugo, I swear I didn't know.

04:32.577 --> 04:34.111
Well, there is
one other option.

04:34.112 --> 04:35.946
I thought you just said
there was no other option.

04:35.947 --> 04:38.582
You assist Ron and myself
in our undercover

04:38.583 --> 04:41.585
sting investigation of
the meat vendor Jack Conway.

04:41.586 --> 04:43.537
If you want to save
your restaurant,

04:43.538 --> 04:47.341
you're wearing a wire
and you're working for us, Bob!

04:47.342 --> 04:48.926
I believe it's called
"rockin' a wire."

04:48.927 --> 04:50.094
No, it's wearing a wire.

04:50.095 --> 04:51.796
It could be both!

04:51.797 --> 04:53.547
No! ‭He's wearing it,
he's rocking it.

04:53.548 --> 04:56.474
No, you wear... I wear a hat,
but I rock the hat I wear!

04:57.802 --> 04:59.177
So, you were right.

04:59.178 --> 05:00.912
Same great quality,
lower price.

05:00.913 --> 05:02.330
(whispers):
Set up another meat delivery.

05:02.331 --> 05:03.815
Uh, I would, uh,
I would love to buy

05:03.816 --> 05:05.867
another box of your,
uh, prime beef.

05:05.868 --> 05:07.202
(heavy breathing)

05:07.203 --> 05:08.620
Tina, baby, shh.

05:08.621 --> 05:10.255
Your father's
in the middle of a sting.

05:10.256 --> 05:11.589
Great, we'll see you then.

05:11.590 --> 05:12.707
He's on his way.

05:12.708 --> 05:14.259
Okay, the snare is set.

05:14.260 --> 05:15.760
Now we just need to shave you.

05:15.761 --> 05:17.045
What?

05:17.046 --> 05:18.880
Take off your shirt, Bob.
Why?

05:18.881 --> 05:21.599
I need to shave your chest
so I can tape a mic to it.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.885
Ugh, why didn't you just get
Jimmy Pesto to do the sting?

05:23.886 --> 05:25.552
He bought horse meat first.

05:25.604 --> 05:27.522
"Jimmy Pesto"?

05:27.523 --> 05:29.607
He might be gorgeous,
but he's not the sharpest bulb

05:29.608 --> 05:31.559
in the lightbulb store.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.443
You think Jimmy Pesto
is gorgeous?

05:33.529 --> 05:35.230
Hot, handsome... whatever!

05:35.231 --> 05:37.315
Look, do you want us to shut
your restaurant down?

05:37.316 --> 05:39.984
Fine, shave me.
What is that?

05:39.985 --> 05:42.036
It's sweet and sour sauce
from the Lucky Dragon.

05:42.037 --> 05:44.072
Why are you putting
that on me?

05:44.073 --> 05:46.241
For shaving cream.
It's-it's all we had in the van.

05:46.242 --> 05:47.458
(sighs)
Great.

05:47.459 --> 05:48.960
Do health inspectors
even do this?

05:48.961 --> 05:50.962
Isn't this more of
an FDA kind of thing?

05:50.963 --> 05:53.581
Oh, this is definitely
an FDA kind of thing.

05:53.582 --> 05:55.416
We're way out
of our jurisdiction.

05:55.417 --> 05:57.418
So maybe we should
just call them?

05:57.419 --> 05:58.837
(chuckles)
I'll call them.

05:58.838 --> 06:00.255
After I solve
this case myself

06:00.256 --> 06:02.223
and throw it
in their stupid faces!

06:02.224 --> 06:04.892
In other words, you guys have
no idea what you're doing.

06:04.927 --> 06:07.061
Bob, if we had no idea
what we were doing,

06:07.062 --> 06:10.148
would we have
this wireless audio transmitter?

06:10.149 --> 06:11.649
It looks like a kids' toy.

06:11.650 --> 06:13.101
That is a kids' toy.

06:13.102 --> 06:14.936
Technically,
it's ages 12 and up.

06:14.937 --> 06:16.237
All that matters
is that it works.

06:16.238 --> 06:18.072
It has a range of 50 feet!

06:18.073 --> 06:19.941
Now, Ron and I will be
parked across the street,

06:19.942 --> 06:22.777
listening in
and recording onto this!

06:22.778 --> 06:24.279
Toy.
Yeah, toy!

06:24.280 --> 06:26.614
But we're not
playing games, Bob!

06:26.615 --> 06:28.032
We need you to record
two things.

06:28.033 --> 06:31.119
One... Jack claiming his
meat is USDA Prime beef.

06:31.120 --> 06:34.037
And two... Jack accepting
payment for it.

06:34.123 --> 06:35.840
Okay, I got it.

06:35.841 --> 06:39.294
And three... me punching Jack
over and over

06:39.295 --> 06:40.762
- and over and over...
- Okay, Tina, okay.

06:40.763 --> 06:42.964
And over and over...

06:42.965 --> 06:44.465
Listen, when Jack gets here,
this whole thing

06:44.466 --> 06:46.467
is gonna be over pretty quick.

06:46.468 --> 06:49.304
So do you guys think you can
act normal for five minutes?

06:49.305 --> 06:52.640
We'll give you four minutes of
normal and one minute of formal.

06:52.641 --> 06:55.777
Tina, honey, I know you're
upset about the horse meat,

06:55.778 --> 06:57.312
but do you think you'll be
able to keep it cool?

06:57.313 --> 06:58.812
I'm cool.
(grunts)

06:58.898 --> 07:00.365
(clattering)
Okay, you know what?

07:00.366 --> 07:02.066
Kids, you're going upstairs
till this is over.

07:02.067 --> 07:04.235
What?! Dad, nothing exciting
ever happens here.

07:04.236 --> 07:05.787
Come on, please,
we have so little.

07:05.788 --> 07:07.506
This is our Woodstock.

07:07.573 --> 07:09.123
Aw, let them stay, Bobby.

07:09.124 --> 07:10.908
Oh, he's here!
Act normal.

07:10.993 --> 07:12.577
Then formal.
‭Hey, Bob!

07:12.578 --> 07:13.962
♪ Here comes the meat plane ♪

07:13.963 --> 07:15.163
♪ Right to your counter. ♪

07:15.164 --> 07:16.547
I like that song.

07:16.548 --> 07:17.916
What's that from?

07:17.917 --> 07:18.883
Uh, it's my delivery song.

07:18.884 --> 07:19.918
There it is.

07:19.919 --> 07:21.636
The-the meat I ordered.

07:21.637 --> 07:24.172
And here's the money
I'm paying you for it.

07:24.173 --> 07:25.306
(whispers):
Well said, Dad.

07:25.307 --> 07:26.557
All right, we're all set.

07:26.558 --> 07:27.592
Have a great day!

07:27.593 --> 07:28.693
Wait.
‭Yeah?

07:28.761 --> 07:30.345
Uh, we should talk...

07:30.346 --> 07:32.679
we... talk more now.

07:32.731 --> 07:34.015
Uh, sure.

07:34.016 --> 07:36.017
Yeah, so meat?
‭Yes?

07:36.018 --> 07:38.186
Let's talk meat.
I never get to talk meat.

07:38.187 --> 07:40.321
Okay, let's-let's-let's do it.
Let's talk some meat.

07:40.322 --> 07:41.939
Hey, you guys
having a meat talk?

07:42.024 --> 07:43.358
I mean, I bet it's not easy

07:43.359 --> 07:45.076
lugging around
all those boxes, you know?

07:45.077 --> 07:48.547
After all, they're full
of USDA Prime beef, right?

07:48.614 --> 07:49.663
Well, you said it, pal.

07:49.698 --> 07:51.115
Right, I-I said it.

07:51.116 --> 07:52.867
Now you say it.

07:52.868 --> 07:54.534
Say what?
Say-say what I said.

07:54.586 --> 07:55.703
Say what you said about what?

07:55.704 --> 07:57.705
About what's in the boxes.

07:57.706 --> 07:59.874
You-you want me to
say what you said

07:59.875 --> 08:00.959
about what's in the boxes?

08:00.960 --> 08:02.042
Is it hot in here?

08:02.094 --> 08:03.544
I'm just hot.

08:03.545 --> 08:04.595
JACK:
Eh, it's a little hot.

08:04.596 --> 08:05.463
BOB:
Whew.

08:05.464 --> 08:06.931
Oh, my God!

08:06.932 --> 08:08.299
He's worse
than we thought he'd be.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.051
You know, Bob,
I didn't realize this

08:10.052 --> 08:12.854
the first time we met,
you're a little weird, man.

08:12.855 --> 08:15.022
I am?
‭Yeah!

08:15.057 --> 08:16.307
I like it, you know?

08:16.308 --> 08:17.442
I'm a little weird, too.

08:17.443 --> 08:18.893
We're-we're both weirdos.

08:18.894 --> 08:20.278
Here's that water
you ordered.

08:20.279 --> 08:21.279
I didn't order any water.

08:21.363 --> 08:22.613
Tina, what are you doing?

08:22.614 --> 08:24.282
Oh, no.
I'm accidentally spilling

08:24.283 --> 08:25.867
this glass of water
on your shoe.

08:25.868 --> 08:27.284
Whoa!
‭Tina, no!

08:27.369 --> 08:29.320
Jack, I-I-I'm sorry
about that.

08:29.321 --> 08:31.072
Oh, no, no, no, please,
listen, it's fine, it's fine.

08:31.073 --> 08:32.874
Hey, I'd better get going.

08:32.875 --> 08:34.325
Tina, I don't know why
you put water on my foot,

08:34.326 --> 08:35.876
but you made an impression.

08:35.878 --> 08:37.628
And in business,
that's half the battle.

08:37.629 --> 08:38.996
And we're clear.

08:38.998 --> 08:40.214
Nice work, everyone.

08:40.215 --> 08:41.631
Tina, especially.

08:41.633 --> 08:42.631
Whew!

08:42.634 --> 08:44.085
We got nothing!

08:44.086 --> 08:45.586
We're doing another sting!

08:45.587 --> 08:47.255
Bob, you're ordering
more horse meat!

08:47.256 --> 08:48.306
Crap.

08:48.307 --> 08:49.974
Ron, re-shave Bob's chest.

08:49.975 --> 08:50.891
On it.
‭What?!

08:50.926 --> 08:52.093
No, you just shaved it!

08:52.094 --> 08:53.928
Plus, it's getting itchy.

08:53.929 --> 08:55.430
Belcher children,
when Jack comes back,

08:55.431 --> 08:56.981
you're out of the restaurant.

08:56.982 --> 08:58.348
Fine, we'll help out
in the van.

08:58.434 --> 09:00.401
No way... I don't want you
getting your germs

09:00.402 --> 09:02.437
all over
my germ-testing equipment!

09:02.438 --> 09:05.773
Oh, well, then I guess I'll just
put in a little call to the FDA,

09:05.774 --> 09:07.942
and we'll all LOL
about a health inspector

09:07.943 --> 09:10.160
running a sting
investigation.

09:10.245 --> 09:11.996
Okay, fine.

09:11.997 --> 09:14.165
You call them
and have them shut us down,

09:14.166 --> 09:17.752
then we'll call us
and have us shut you down!

09:17.753 --> 09:19.921
Guys, please,
can we just get this over with?

09:19.922 --> 09:21.873
Fine! You kids get
to stay in the van!

09:21.874 --> 09:23.257
Bob, make the call.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.759

you're scratching
your chest a lot.

10:24.186 --> 10:25.653
Don't, uh, do that.
‭What?

10:25.654 --> 10:27.321
(whispers):
Stop scratching your chest.

10:27.322 --> 10:30.191

scratch your nipples off.

10:30.192 --> 10:31.692
Oh. Right.

10:31.693 --> 10:33.160

We got something, Dad.

Wrong number?

11:34.089 --> 11:36.340
Jack Conway just invited us
to his birthday party.

11:36.341 --> 11:38.342
He did?
‭He said we're his best customers.

11:38.343 --> 11:42.012
And his favorite. He said he's
gonna have a Slippy Slide. Ooh.

11:42.097 --> 11:45.399
Well, you better suit up, 'cause
you're going to that party.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.568
Yeah! ‭Yes! When he blows
out his birthday candles,

11:47.569 --> 11:50.188
someone will say, "What did you
wish for, getting taken down?"

11:50.189 --> 11:51.906
And he'll be like, "No."

11:51.907 --> 11:54.793
But it will still be cool.
So let's rehearse that.

11:56.387 --> 11:58.485
It doesn't feel great being
at a guy's house to sting him

11:58.486 --> 12:00.353
on his birthday.
Dad, you gettin' sweet

12:00.354 --> 12:01.770

12:12.533 --> 12:14.201
Yeah, Dad,
we're taking him down!

12:14.202 --> 12:16.119
Now, listen, since you
stepped on the transmitter

12:16.120 --> 12:18.371
with your big fat foot,
you're gonna have to carry this

12:18.372 --> 12:21.041
right in your pocket. You'll
need to get as close as you can

12:21.042 --> 12:24.344
to pick up Jack's voice.
Ron, put it in Bob's pocket.

12:24.345 --> 12:26.596
I can put it in my own pocket.
‭Not bad.

12:26.597 --> 12:28.515

Oh, that's just
a base coat. Oh.

TINA: Jimmy Jr.'s eating a hot dog.
That's nice.

13:53.801 --> 13:56.269
Wait. What if Jack put
horse meat in the hot dogs?

13:56.270 --> 13:58.104
Horse dogs!

13:58.105 --> 14:01.308

like it had a big hair on it.

to go get a new hot dog. No!

of this glass of wine!

14:15.990 --> 14:19.208

seems like a nice guy.

14:31.889 --> 14:34.140
We're undercover!
It's part of the job!

14:34.141 --> 14:36.642
You think I want to eat
all this guacamole?!

14:36.677 --> 14:39.179
Yeah, it's too bad we're gonna
ruin these people's lives.

14:39.180 --> 14:42.314
Should we not do the thing
and just have nice drinks?

14:42.350 --> 14:44.516
And slippity slide every day?

14:44.602 --> 14:46.269
Shush, shush. Here comes Tina.
Stop having fun.

14:46.270 --> 14:48.688
Hey, sweetie.
How you doing?

14:48.689 --> 14:50.991
Hey. What are you guys talking
about?

14:50.992 --> 14:53.492
Uh... ‭Uh, don't remember.
‭Middle East.

14:53.527 --> 14:56.029
JIMMY: Hey, hey!
So, you invited Jimmy Pesto, huh?

14:56.030 --> 14:58.581
Yeah, actually, he heard
‭about it and he invited himself.

14:58.582 --> 15:01.534
He got here yesterday.
So, Jack,

15:01.535 --> 15:05.088
uh, are-are
you selling Jimmy

15:05.089 --> 15:07.040
the same meat
that you're selling me? ‭What?

15:07.041 --> 15:09.793
Oh, no, no, no, no. Jimmy
buys the super cheap stuff.

15:09.794 --> 15:11.043
Right. Right.

15:11.095 --> 15:14.129
A-And-and you sell me the...

15:14.215 --> 15:16.883
The good cheap stuff.
(chuckles)

15:16.884 --> 15:18.184
(chuckles)
Right. Yeah.

15:18.185 --> 15:20.886
Um, which is...

15:20.938 --> 15:23.356
Which is...

15:23.357 --> 15:26.643
good?
(chuckles) You-you had a phrase for it, Jack.

15:26.644 --> 15:28.561
Um, I'm totally blanking
on the phrase. ‭I did?

15:28.562 --> 15:31.064
What-what was the way
you described what you sell me?

15:31.065 --> 15:32.899
Oh, you mean USDA Prime?

15:32.900 --> 15:33.900
Yep, yep.
That's it.

15:33.901 --> 15:34.984
I-I can't believe

15:34.985 --> 15:36.902
I forgot those words.

15:36.987 --> 15:40.156
But if you were to put it as a
statement instead of a question?

15:40.157 --> 15:42.042
If... and hold on,
before you say anything...

15:42.043 --> 15:43.710
what would you sound like?

15:43.711 --> 15:45.078
Um...

15:45.079 --> 15:48.381
You, Jack, sell me, Bob...

15:48.382 --> 15:50.633
But wait for one second
before you do it.

15:50.634 --> 15:51.884
And now do it.

15:51.919 --> 15:52.969
USDA...

15:52.970 --> 15:54.920
Prime... beef.

15:54.972 --> 15:56.339
Right!
(chuckles)

15:56.340 --> 15:57.757
Brain fart...
you just said that.

15:57.758 --> 15:59.725
And I...
so that clears that up.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.094
Hey, uh, what are you
doing up there, Bob?

16:01.095 --> 16:03.263
Oh, I'm just, uh...
just enjoying the view.

16:03.264 --> 16:05.398
I mean, you can really see
the whole party from here.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.817
And, um, I just want
to see where my kids are.

16:07.818 --> 16:09.018
So there they are.

16:09.019 --> 16:10.103
Yeah, look at them.

16:10.104 --> 16:11.520
They don't play much.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.677
You like ska, Bob?

16:14.742 --> 16:16.192
Um... the music?

16:16.193 --> 16:17.346
Yeah, do you like ska?

16:17.411 --> 16:19.746
Um, I forget if I do.

16:19.747 --> 16:21.280
Do-do I have to?

16:21.332 --> 16:22.949
Why don't you come inside?

16:22.950 --> 16:24.451
I want to play you some
ska that will turn you

16:24.452 --> 16:26.285
into an "a-ska-cionado."

16:28.973 --> 16:31.024
(ska playing loudly)
Wow, that's really loud.

16:31.025 --> 16:32.592
Oh, sorry.
Uh, is that too much?

16:32.593 --> 16:34.226
I can't really hear you.

16:34.295 --> 16:36.296
(whispers):
I know.

16:36.297 --> 16:38.493
Know what?
Why-why are you whispering?

16:38.549 --> 16:40.799
I know... about the sting.

16:40.851 --> 16:42.452
Oh, crap.

16:42.453 --> 16:44.014
Did you just kiss my ear?

16:44.015 --> 16:45.750
That was an accident.

16:47.647 --> 16:48.731
How could you do
this to me, Bob?

16:48.732 --> 16:49.732
You're wearing a wire?

16:49.733 --> 16:50.699
I thought we were friends.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.084
You lied to me.

16:52.085 --> 16:53.985
Look, I didn't want
to lie to you... wait.

16:54.070 --> 16:55.287
You lied to me.

16:55.288 --> 16:56.538
You sold me horse.

16:56.573 --> 16:57.790
Don't make this about that.

16:57.791 --> 16:59.492
So, somebody's listening
to us right now?

16:59.493 --> 17:01.293
Who am I talking to?
Am I talking to the Feds?

17:01.294 --> 17:03.078
No, I...
I was wearing a wire.

17:03.079 --> 17:05.998
Now I just have
this tape recorder.

17:05.999 --> 17:08.584
So... nobody is
listening to us?

17:08.585 --> 17:10.886
Nobody's heard me say
anything to you today?

17:10.887 --> 17:12.838
No. I'm realizing now
that I probably

17:12.839 --> 17:15.057
shouldn't have told you that.
‭Right.

17:15.058 --> 17:16.308
Hey, separately, can I take

17:16.309 --> 17:17.760
a look at
that thing for a second?

17:17.761 --> 17:18.928
Um, no.

17:18.929 --> 17:19.928
Well played.

17:19.930 --> 17:21.347
I've got nervous tummy, Ron.

17:21.348 --> 17:22.731
I've got a bad feeling.

17:22.732 --> 17:24.349
I'm sure it's going okay.

17:24.351 --> 17:25.601
I brought a book on tape.

17:25.602 --> 17:26.652
Want to listen to that?

17:26.653 --> 17:27.736
No, Ron!

17:27.737 --> 17:29.238
It's read by Alan Alda.

17:29.239 --> 17:30.906
Fine!
Put it on!

17:30.907 --> 17:32.408
Listen, if this
is about the money,

17:32.409 --> 17:34.108
I can pay you back!

17:34.160 --> 17:36.911
Huh? How does that sound?
It's not about the money.

17:36.947 --> 17:38.497
Is it about the meat?
Is that what it's about?

17:38.498 --> 17:39.999
'Cause I can
replace the horse meat

17:40.000 --> 17:42.334
in your fridge
with real beef, okay?

17:42.335 --> 17:44.253
I just have to
find a distributor

17:44.254 --> 17:45.955
that sells beef, that's...

17:45.956 --> 17:47.957
Jack, I'm giving this tape
to the health inspector.

17:47.958 --> 17:49.792
Okay, Bob.

17:49.793 --> 17:52.127
You got to do what you got
to do, and I, I respect that.

17:52.128 --> 17:53.429
What is that over there?

17:53.430 --> 17:55.096
Is that an active volcano?
Huh?

17:55.131 --> 17:56.181
Give it to me!

17:56.182 --> 17:57.683
(both grunting)

17:57.684 --> 17:58.933
Give me it!
‭Got it!

17:58.969 --> 18:00.685
Lin!

18:00.770 --> 18:01.804
Kids, we're going!

18:01.805 --> 18:03.973
We are minutes away from cake!

18:03.974 --> 18:05.441
Okay, I don't think there's
any hair on this one,

18:05.442 --> 18:07.560
so I'm just gonna
eat it, okay?

18:07.561 --> 18:08.811
(grunts)
‭Damn it, Tina!

18:08.812 --> 18:09.945
I got to go!
See you at school!

18:09.946 --> 18:11.294
Thanks for having us!

18:12.148 --> 18:13.481
Bob,

18:13.567 --> 18:15.617
you forgot to hug
the host good-bye.

18:15.652 --> 18:18.202
(both grunting)

18:19.873 --> 18:23.042
BOB (grunting):
Uh... uh...

18:23.043 --> 18:24.159
That crazy son of a bitch.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.494
He's gonna slide.

18:25.495 --> 18:27.830
Coming through!
Coming through!

18:27.831 --> 18:29.999
Slide, you old bastard!

18:30.000 --> 18:31.749
The grass is wet!
He's still sliding!

18:31.835 --> 18:32.982
(Bob shouting)

18:34.421 --> 18:35.804
Is that Bob's head?

18:35.805 --> 18:37.338
Hugo, Ron, I'm stuck!

18:37.390 --> 18:39.758
That was an amazing slide, Bob!

18:39.759 --> 18:41.727
But now I'm gonna need
that tape recorder.

18:41.728 --> 18:43.511
Hugo, catch!
No, don't!

18:45.565 --> 18:46.849
(distorted):
I'm not good

18:46.850 --> 18:49.518
at catching things!

18:49.519 --> 18:51.402
(muttering)

18:54.013 --> 18:55.691
I've never been good at it!

18:55.692 --> 18:57.076
Ha-ha!
Yes!

18:57.077 --> 18:58.494
It's broken!

18:58.495 --> 18:59.578
Hey, look.
The tape's okay.

18:59.579 --> 19:00.663
Aw, damn it.

19:00.664 --> 19:02.196
Happy birthday, punk.

19:03.867 --> 19:05.200
Looks like Jimmy Pesto's
still mad at me

19:05.201 --> 19:06.869
for bringing
his meat prices back up.

19:06.870 --> 19:08.620
(making fart sounds)

19:08.705 --> 19:10.456
So, uh, Bob,
think I could get one of those,

19:10.457 --> 19:11.924
uh, burgers from you?

19:11.925 --> 19:13.291
Sure, coming right up, Teddy.

19:13.376 --> 19:14.710
Know what I'm saying, Bob...

19:14.711 --> 19:15.843
a... (hums) burger?

19:15.879 --> 19:17.713
No, what are you talking about?

19:17.714 --> 19:19.931
One of those special...
(hums) burgers?

19:20.016 --> 19:21.215
You know?

19:21.301 --> 19:23.218
(hums)
Looks like a duck.

19:23.219 --> 19:24.887
Quacks like a duck.

19:24.888 --> 19:26.555
(neighs)
‭Oh, my God.

19:26.556 --> 19:28.189
Teddy, we don't
sell horse anymore.

19:28.224 --> 19:29.391
Oh, come on!

19:29.392 --> 19:30.859
I can't stop thinking about it!

19:30.860 --> 19:32.528
