01:46.033 --> 01:48.367
- Sigmund Freud said
that the purpose of our dreams

01:48.433 --> 01:51.200
is to satisfy
certain instinctual urges

01:51.266 --> 01:53.533
that society deems unacceptable.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.867
For instance, instead of killing
an oppressive father,

01:55.934 --> 01:57.600
which would be
too horrible to handle,

01:57.667 --> 01:59.934
we dream of throwing
our boss out the window.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.233
Freud believed that the mind
will often modify our dreams

02:03.300 --> 02:05.600
in order to keep
strong emotions at bay.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.100
And with less emotion,

02:07.166 --> 02:10.000
a man can get up, go to work,
and be a good citizen.

02:10.066 --> 02:11.400
The difference for us in Oz is,

02:11.467 --> 02:13.600
we don't dream of throwing
our boss out the window,

02:13.667 --> 02:15.467
we actually do it.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.667
- So, Alvarez...

02:27.734 --> 02:29.834
Who's responsible?

02:29.900 --> 02:31.333
- I wish I knew.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.834
- You didn't see
who stabbed you?

02:32.900 --> 02:37.000
- No, everything happened
so fast, you know?

02:37.066 --> 02:38.734
- Then I guess
my investigation's over.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.600
- Yeah, it's really
breaking you up, ain't it?

02:44.500 --> 02:45.700
- Man.

02:45.767 --> 02:48.533
I'm no doctor, but...

02:48.600 --> 02:52.200
I've seen a lot
of stab wounds in my time.

02:52.266 --> 02:53.533
If that knife had gone in

02:53.600 --> 02:55.533
another quarter of an inch
to the left,

02:55.600 --> 02:57.867
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

02:57.934 --> 02:59.867
- A quarter of an inch?

02:59.934 --> 03:01.500
No shit.

03:01.567 --> 03:02.767
- No shit.

03:04.266 --> 03:06.867
Guess you were lucky, huh?

03:06.934 --> 03:08.867
- You gonna send me
back to Solitary?

03:08.934 --> 03:11.300
- No, no, no.
I mean...

03:11.367 --> 03:15.934
There's no one I'd rather see
rot in solitary than you,

03:16.000 --> 03:19.400
but I figure
I'll send you back to Em City.

03:19.467 --> 03:23.467
Maybe next time,
you're not so lucky.

03:41.100 --> 03:42.467
- We gotta talk.

03:42.533 --> 03:43.767
- Oh, you want me
to shank you again?

03:43.834 --> 03:47.000
Okay.

03:47.066 --> 03:48.200
- Can I sit down?

03:48.266 --> 03:49.333
- Blow me.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.633
- Get up.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.834
Have a seat.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.367
- So?

04:06.433 --> 04:07.967
- You tried to kill me.

04:08.033 --> 04:10.433
- No, I didn't.
You're alive, ain't you?

04:10.500 --> 04:11.867
That was our deal.

04:11.934 --> 04:14.467
- You were supposed
to stab me in the shoulder, man.

04:14.533 --> 04:16.734
Blade went in a quarter
of an inch from my heart.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.967
- Must've fucking moved, chocha.

04:19.033 --> 04:19.967
What can I say?

04:20.033 --> 04:22.133
- You ain't gotta say nothing.

04:22.200 --> 04:25.667
I just want you to know
that I know the truth, man.

04:25.734 --> 04:28.500
I'm gonna honor our agreement.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.500
I didn't die.

04:30.567 --> 04:32.133
I ain't gonna retaliate.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.567
- Backing off--
wise move, Miguel.

04:36.066 --> 04:37.533
Listen to me carefully.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.300
I'm never gonna welcome you
back into El Norte,

04:41.367 --> 04:45.700
but what I will do is guarantee
that we'll leave you be.

04:45.767 --> 04:46.700
- What the fuck
are you talking about--

04:46.767 --> 04:49.667
- All scores are settled.

04:53.934 --> 04:55.967
- Excuse me.

05:14.033 --> 05:16.800
- I want you to shank me.

05:16.867 --> 05:18.300
I don't know
how you came up with the idea,

05:18.367 --> 05:19.633
but it fucking rocks,

05:19.700 --> 05:22.467
and I see
what it's done for you.

05:22.533 --> 05:25.333
And mostly I see how Morales is.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.900
Him talking to you before,
like he's taking the high road,

05:27.967 --> 05:30.300
being powerful and generous,

05:30.367 --> 05:33.800
but behind his eyes,
he's running scared.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.333
I want to follow you.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.333
- You want to follow me?

05:38.400 --> 05:39.867
- Join your gang.

05:39.934 --> 05:40.900
You're the next wave,

05:40.967 --> 05:43.000
and I want to be
your lieutenant.

05:45.567 --> 05:46.834
Shank me.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.000
I ain't gonna shank you, man.

05:53.066 --> 05:54.333
But I understand,
you know, you think

05:54.400 --> 05:57.233
you gotta prove yourself
and shit, right?

05:57.300 --> 05:58.567
- Yes.

05:58.633 --> 06:00.433
- I'm gonna have you
do something else for me.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.300
- Anything.

06:03.900 --> 06:05.767
- Kill Guerra.

06:20.033 --> 06:22.066
- Step over here, Morales.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.734
- Okay.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.800
- You know who I am?

06:28.867 --> 06:31.300
- Dave Brass, the basketballer.

06:31.367 --> 06:34.467
You played with McManus
against Vahue in those games.

06:34.533 --> 06:35.900
Pretty good for a white boy.

06:37.533 --> 06:39.567
- Who cut my Achilles tendon?

06:40.867 --> 06:42.100
- I don't know.

06:43.233 --> 06:46.834
- Look, I don't care
whose idea it was.

06:46.900 --> 06:49.300
All I want is the guy
who actually did the deed.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.433
- I wish I could help you out.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.500
- You lying piece of shit.

06:54.567 --> 06:57.100
You're gonna regret
that you didn't.

06:59.567 --> 07:01.166
- You know...

07:01.233 --> 07:03.000
You had
the sweetest crossover dribble

07:03.066 --> 07:04.734
I've ever seen.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.500
Juking right,

07:06.567 --> 07:08.734
then planting that foot,
then going left.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.767
I don't know how many times
you dressed down Vahue

07:11.834 --> 07:13.033
with that move.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.600
But you know what they say.

07:16.667 --> 07:19.834
You take away
a basketball god's first step,

07:19.900 --> 07:22.900
and all you got is a CO
with a broken wheel.

07:39.533 --> 07:41.133
- What you doing?

07:41.200 --> 07:42.467
- I've started
a letter writing campaign

07:42.533 --> 07:43.967
to protest
the possible cancellation

07:44.033 --> 07:45.600
of "Miss Sally's Schoolyard."

07:45.667 --> 07:48.166
- This one's signed by Stanton.

07:48.233 --> 07:49.667
- Yeah, he's a good guy,
that Stanton.

07:49.734 --> 07:52.000
- Stanton's in Solitary.

07:52.066 --> 07:53.700
- All right, so I fudged a few.

07:53.767 --> 07:57.000
- Wangler. Adebisi.

07:57.066 --> 07:58.500
Groves--
Groves?

07:58.567 --> 08:00.500
- Okay, I fudged them all.

08:00.567 --> 08:03.166
None of those yerts out there
would rally for the cause.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.900
You want to write one?

08:04.967 --> 08:06.633
- No offense,

08:06.700 --> 08:08.033
but the only thing
I want renewed

08:08.100 --> 08:10.333
is my grandson's chance
to beat his leukemia.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.100
- Right, sorry.

08:12.166 --> 08:14.433
What's the latest
on his condition?

08:14.500 --> 08:16.600
- You gotta pay to play.

08:16.667 --> 08:18.767
There's a cure to be found,
but it'll cost,

08:18.834 --> 08:22.233
and I still haven't figured out
a way to raise the money.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.400
- Next up is Whitney Allen,

08:25.467 --> 08:26.967
star of
"Miss Sally's Schoolyard,"

08:27.033 --> 08:29.300
to tell us about next week's
Mightyball drawing.

08:29.367 --> 08:30.300
Whitney?

08:30.367 --> 08:31.467
- Hi, Warren, how are you?

08:31.533 --> 08:32.467
- Very well, thank you.

08:32.533 --> 08:33.967
Thanks for dropping by.

08:34.033 --> 08:35.300
- Who are all these numb nuts
that play the lottery?

08:35.367 --> 08:37.133
- I've played the lottery.
- Me too.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.033
- Like I said.
Numb nuts.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.600
Out of 51 numbers,
you gotta pick the right number,

08:41.667 --> 08:43.867
not once but six times in a row.

08:43.934 --> 08:45.333
- I say it is possible to win.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.934
- Jesus Christ, Busmalis,

08:47.000 --> 08:48.700
you'd have a better chance
of getting struck by lightning.

08:48.767 --> 08:50.467
- Approximately
1,000 people a year

08:50.533 --> 08:53.033
win a million dollars or more
in North American lotteries.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.133
In contrast...

08:55.200 --> 08:57.734
less than 100 people a year
are hit by lightning.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.100
- So don't forget to play,

08:59.166 --> 09:01.900
'cause the winner
might just be you.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.767
- Excuse me, Officer Brass.
- Yeah?

09:11.834 --> 09:13.600
- Bob Rebadow.

09:13.667 --> 09:15.600
You've always seemed like
a sympathetic fellow to me.

09:15.667 --> 09:17.600
- What do you want?

09:17.667 --> 09:20.266
- I want you to purchase
a lottery ticket for me.

09:20.333 --> 09:21.667
The jackpot is $2 million.

09:21.734 --> 09:24.100
I'll cut you in.

09:24.166 --> 09:25.367
- Cut me in on what?

09:25.433 --> 09:27.133
- The prize money.

09:30.033 --> 09:32.133
What in the world makes
you think you're gonna win?

09:32.200 --> 09:33.767
- God told me.

09:33.834 --> 09:36.133
These are the winning numbers.

09:38.033 --> 09:39.967
- Whoop.

09:48.767 --> 09:50.600
Hey, Dave, how you doing?

09:50.667 --> 09:53.500
- What's the deal with this guy,
Bob Rebadow?

09:53.567 --> 09:54.700
- Uh, nothing.

09:54.767 --> 09:56.000
Why, is he giving you trouble?

09:56.066 --> 09:59.133
- No, I just thought
the guy might be psychotic.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.166
At dinner he starts telling me
God speaks to him.

10:02.233 --> 10:04.667
- Oh, yeah,
he's had an ongoing tête-à-tête

10:04.734 --> 10:06.333
with the Almighty
for some time now.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.767
Actually,
he's relatively stable.

10:10.734 --> 10:11.834
- First time
I've touched one of these

10:11.900 --> 10:14.500
since my Achilles got cut.

10:14.567 --> 10:16.333
It's a perfect
fucking ball, man.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.166
Gummy.
Beat-up.

10:18.233 --> 10:19.667
Give you mad handle.

10:19.734 --> 10:21.667
This ball will
make you Pete Maravich.

10:21.734 --> 10:24.834
- Oh, Jesus, Pistol Pete.

10:24.900 --> 10:27.433
Greatest scorer
in the history of college ball.

10:27.500 --> 10:28.834
- When he was growing up,

10:28.900 --> 10:30.667
he used to carry a ball
with him at all times,

10:30.734 --> 10:32.934
no matter what--
in school, on a date--

10:33.000 --> 10:34.100
didn't matter.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.200
He'd even go to bed
with a basketball,

10:36.266 --> 10:37.567
like a marriage.

10:37.633 --> 10:39.700
So I started doing it.

10:39.767 --> 10:41.700
I quit sleeping with it
when I got to college,

10:41.767 --> 10:43.800
but other than that...

10:48.600 --> 10:49.867
- Come on, man.
You want to shoot, shoot.

10:49.934 --> 10:50.900
- It's all right.
- Come on.

10:50.967 --> 10:52.333
I can stick around for a while.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.567
- I gotta go.

10:53.633 --> 10:55.200
Gotta make an extra stop
on my way home.

10:55.266 --> 10:56.567
I gotta buy a lottery ticket.

10:56.633 --> 10:59.600
- Well, another night, then.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.300
We'll stay late.
We'll shoot around.

11:02.433 --> 11:04.700
- You know
how Pete Maravich died?

11:04.767 --> 11:06.200
Playing basketball.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.066
Been retired eight years.

11:08.133 --> 11:10.100
Was out running
in a pickup game,

11:10.166 --> 11:11.300
heart attack,

11:11.367 --> 11:13.000
up and down the court
one minute,

11:13.066 --> 11:14.734
falling over dead the next.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.333
Till death do us part.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.767
He's able to live that,
literally.

11:22.233 --> 11:25.000
But I won't be able to.

11:25.066 --> 11:29.166
So stop fucking asking me
to shoot around with you.

11:29.233 --> 11:30.967
All right?

11:34.066 --> 11:36.500
- Ugh...
- Hey!

11:36.567 --> 11:39.100
- No!

11:39.166 --> 11:42.200
- First of all, let me say
I'm glad you're fully recovered.

11:42.266 --> 11:45.367
Secondly, I understand you want
to return to Emerald City.

11:45.433 --> 11:49.867
And you can understand
that that's a tough call for me.

11:49.934 --> 11:52.367
Before you got... hurt,

11:52.433 --> 11:55.367
you continuously threatened
the lives of Enrique Morales

11:55.433 --> 11:57.266
and the other Latinos,

11:57.333 --> 12:01.033
and plus,
Cyril O'Reily's in there.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.767
- Mr. McManus.

12:02.834 --> 12:04.533
Getting hit by Cyril O'Reily

12:04.600 --> 12:07.266
may have been the single
greatest event in my life.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.033
There I was,
on the brink of death,

12:09.100 --> 12:11.133
and suddenly I could see
all that I had done

12:11.200 --> 12:14.467
and, more importantly,
if I survived,

12:14.533 --> 12:16.500
all that I could do.

12:16.567 --> 12:19.333
Have you ever had
an experience like that?

12:19.400 --> 12:20.834
- Well, yes, I have.

12:20.900 --> 12:23.500
- Whether or not
you bring me back to Em City

12:23.567 --> 12:27.800
is ultimately irrelevant...
and yet I'm drawn there.

12:27.867 --> 12:31.166
Why?
I don't know.

12:31.233 --> 12:34.000
- All right.
Let's give it a shot.

12:34.066 --> 12:35.500
But I want you
to have interaction sessions

12:35.567 --> 12:37.333
with Peter Marie.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.333
- I'm sorry I hurt you.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.166
- Why did you hit Kenmin, Cyril?

12:47.233 --> 12:49.867
- He was punching Ryan.

12:49.934 --> 12:52.533
- Why were you punching Ryan?

12:52.600 --> 12:55.533
- I'd been in the cage all day.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.200
I was feeling feisty.

12:57.266 --> 12:59.533
I decided to show off.
It was stupid.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.734
Yeah.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.033
- Ryan.
- What?

13:03.100 --> 13:05.033
His bullshit almost
got Cyril transferred

13:05.100 --> 13:06.633
to the fucking insane asylum.

13:06.700 --> 13:09.867
- The rules are
no interrupting and no swearing.

13:13.166 --> 13:14.333
- I take full blame

13:14.400 --> 13:16.100
for everything
that's happened to me.

13:17.533 --> 13:20.033
Which is why
I want to make peace.

13:24.066 --> 13:25.433
- Ah, ah, ah.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.166
Sit the fuck down.

13:27.233 --> 13:29.166
- No.

13:29.233 --> 13:31.033
I want to make peace too.

13:33.667 --> 13:36.200
- Go ahead.

13:43.900 --> 13:45.934
- Ah, fuck.

14:28.633 --> 14:30.734
- Prisoner #02L333.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.734
Li Chen.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.834
Convicted January 14th, 2002.

14:34.900 --> 14:36.333
Four counts of attempted murder.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.200
Sentence: 32 years.

14:38.266 --> 14:39.533
Up for parole in 20.

15:01.166 --> 15:02.233
- ♪ Mm ♪

15:02.300 --> 15:06.033
♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah... ♪

15:06.100 --> 15:07.200
- Okay.

15:16.033 --> 15:19.233
- Stop laughing, Ryan.
- Ryan, behave!

15:19.300 --> 15:20.433
- I know, okay, okay, I'm sorry,

15:20.500 --> 15:22.467
but Cyril's singing
really sucks.

15:22.533 --> 15:24.300
- Now, I-I have told you

15:24.367 --> 15:26.467
that this program is not
about becoming Pavarotti.

15:26.533 --> 15:28.133
It's about learning
how to express your feelings

15:28.200 --> 15:29.133
through the music.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.300
You did very good, Cyril.

15:31.367 --> 15:32.967
- Thank you.
- That's more like "Pavarotten".

15:33.033 --> 15:34.166
- All right, you try.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.533
- Uh-uh.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.667
No, no, the deal was,
I sign up for this class

15:37.734 --> 15:39.700
to spend more time with you--
that's it, I'm not singing.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.667
- So, this session's over,
but next Friday, Ryan,

15:43.734 --> 15:45.000
I want to hear you sing.

15:45.066 --> 15:46.000
- Okay, Mom, but you know what?

15:46.066 --> 15:47.900
I'll do you one better.

15:47.967 --> 15:49.333
- Suzanne,
your next two students are here.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.667
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:50.734 --> 15:52.834
What's this?

15:52.900 --> 15:54.333
- I heard
your mother was teaching,

15:54.400 --> 15:56.533
so I decided
to give it a whirl.

16:00.066 --> 16:01.533
Jia Kenmin.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.166
- Suzanne Fitzgerald.

16:03.233 --> 16:06.000
- Li Chen.
- Welcome, both of you.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.333
- Let's go, O'Reily.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.367
- Yeah, yeah,
in a second, Brass.

16:08.433 --> 16:10.000
- Now, fuckwad.

16:10.066 --> 16:12.300
- Yeah, you fuckin' cripple.
- Bye, guys.

16:12.367 --> 16:15.367
- So, have you guys...

16:17.033 --> 16:18.133
- What's the matter, Ryan?

16:18.200 --> 16:19.800
- I got a bad feeling, man.

16:19.867 --> 16:21.166
- About what?

16:21.233 --> 16:23.066
- About that piss stain,
Jia Kenmin.

16:23.133 --> 16:24.400
I know he's perpetrating,

16:24.467 --> 16:26.800
I know he's plotting
something against us.

16:26.867 --> 16:28.734
I think
he might want to hurt my ma.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.033
- I like her.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.900
- Yeah, well,
she likes you, too, Cyril.

16:31.967 --> 16:33.567
- You want to trade?

16:35.367 --> 16:36.600
- Trade?
Trade what?

16:43.567 --> 16:45.934
- I'll give you
my most prized possession

16:46.000 --> 16:48.033
if you give me her.

16:49.233 --> 16:50.667
- We don't have to trade, Cyril.

16:50.734 --> 16:52.133
We can share her, you know that.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.233
- Really?
- Yeah. Hey.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.400
Don't I share
everything with you?

17:00.567 --> 17:02.166
Hey, Jia.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.400
- Your mother's
a wonderful person.

17:06.467 --> 17:07.767
- Yeah, well,
see that she stays that way.

17:07.834 --> 17:08.767
- Meaning what?

17:08.834 --> 17:09.900
- You fuck with her one time,

17:09.967 --> 17:10.900
you go back into a coma.

17:10.967 --> 17:12.600
This time, it's permanent.

17:12.667 --> 17:15.300
- Look, you have nothing
to fear from me.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.967
But Li Chen,
he is a different matter.

17:19.033 --> 17:21.200
He's one sick fuck.

17:30.867 --> 17:32.300
- You're dreaming,

17:32.367 --> 17:34.467
you're deep into REM sleep,

17:34.533 --> 17:37.633
and someone walks in,
someone who's dead,

17:37.700 --> 17:41.367
someone you love--
a father, a mother, a friend--

17:41.433 --> 17:43.800
and you're happy to see
that person alive and well,

17:43.867 --> 17:46.133
happy to have a conversation
to say the things

17:46.200 --> 17:47.834
you never got a chance to say,

17:47.900 --> 17:50.166
but then you wake up,

17:50.233 --> 17:53.500
and the person you loved
is still dead...

17:53.567 --> 17:55.767
and you get to mourn
all over again.

18:02.900 --> 18:04.667
- About fucking time.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.100
What happened to the pool table?

18:17.166 --> 18:20.600
- Hey, it's in dry dock
for repairs.

18:20.667 --> 18:21.934
- Spread the word,
I want a meeting

18:22.033 --> 18:24.633
of the entire brotherhood.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.667
We got some unfinished business
with Chucky Pancamo.

18:30.367 --> 18:33.066
Hey, Petey, what's shaking, man?

18:34.700 --> 18:36.400
- Schillinger's out of Ad Seg.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.800
So, when they letting you
out of here?

18:39.867 --> 18:42.800
- I don't know.
Dr. Nathan won't say.

18:42.867 --> 18:44.300
Things cool with Morales?

18:44.367 --> 18:46.300
- Yeah, yeah, drugs are running
the same as always.

18:46.367 --> 18:47.800
- The kitchen?

18:47.867 --> 18:49.967
- Good, it's under control.

18:50.033 --> 18:51.133
- Hey, Petey.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.467
Don't get used
to runnin' things.

18:52.533 --> 18:53.767
I'm still fuckin' breathin'.

18:53.834 --> 18:55.166
- Yeah, I know.
I know.

18:55.233 --> 18:56.333
But we gotta waste Schillinger

18:56.400 --> 18:58.166
for what he did to you,
you know.

18:58.233 --> 18:59.834
- We'll take care
of that Nazi fuck

18:59.900 --> 19:01.367
when I'm back in circulation.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.567
Capisce?
- Yep. Capisce.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.100
- I got news.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.600
Schillinger's out of the hole.

19:13.667 --> 19:15.266
- Good.

19:15.333 --> 19:16.767
Now we can sit back

19:16.834 --> 19:19.867
and watch the Nazis
wipe out the Sicilians.

19:19.934 --> 19:22.934
- Yeah, but that ain't gonna
do nothing about them spics.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.900
You know,
they as strong as ever,

19:24.967 --> 19:26.600
and you know
Morales is gonna keep

19:26.667 --> 19:28.066
his pact with Pancamo.

19:28.133 --> 19:31.800
- Unless... Morales sees this
as an opportunity

19:31.867 --> 19:35.667
to move three squares forward,
change partners.

19:35.734 --> 19:38.633
I want you to tell Enrique

19:38.700 --> 19:40.767
I want a sit-down.

19:53.867 --> 19:55.667
The older I get,
the more I realize

19:55.734 --> 19:58.567
that my appetites
are merely habits.

19:58.633 --> 20:00.967
I don't crave power anymore.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.000
I just want it
'cause I always had it.

20:04.066 --> 20:06.333
When I first arrived here
at Emerald City,

20:06.400 --> 20:08.000
you made me
a very generous offer

20:08.066 --> 20:09.467
to share the drug trade,

20:09.533 --> 20:13.033
but I ain't used to partners,
so I said no.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.367
Ever since then,

20:14.433 --> 20:16.166
we've been rattling
the sabers at each other,

20:16.233 --> 20:18.300
with neither one of us
gaining very much ground.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.700
- I'm beginning to think
you don't know how to die.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.533
- Oh, Christ, what's this now?

20:24.600 --> 20:25.533
I'm gonna shut 'em down.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.800
- No, no, wait.

20:26.867 --> 20:28.834
Signal your men to get ready,
but let's wait.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.533
- I'm missing the point here.

20:30.600 --> 20:34.333
- Months ago,
we agreed to a truce.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.066
Only thing is, neither one of us
meant the oaths that we swore.

20:38.133 --> 20:42.233
I say we make the lie a reality.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.834
I say we work together.

20:46.266 --> 20:48.333
Peace.

20:54.433 --> 20:55.800
- Well, I'll be fucked.

20:55.867 --> 20:57.100
- All it means, Tim,

20:57.166 --> 20:59.700
is now they're one big
happy tit factory.

20:59.767 --> 21:02.133
- Not when Pancamo finds out.

21:05.233 --> 21:06.166
- Fuck.

21:06.233 --> 21:08.900
- We gotta talk to Chucky.

21:08.967 --> 21:10.767
- Fuck Chucky,
I can handle this.

21:10.834 --> 21:11.767
- Petey.

21:11.834 --> 21:12.834
- My father ran operations here.

21:12.900 --> 21:14.834
I run operations here.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.667
- Adebisi took you down, man.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.000
- That was Pancamo's fault.

21:19.066 --> 21:21.166
Okay, that motherfucker was
supposed to be watching my back,

21:21.233 --> 21:22.433
and he did fucking shit.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.934
- So what the fuck
are we gonna do?

21:27.233 --> 21:28.467
- We're gonna show
these assholes

21:28.533 --> 21:29.734
the Sicilians
are still in charge.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.834
We're gonna massacre
the fucking Nazis.

21:31.900 --> 21:33.333
Where's Said?

21:33.400 --> 21:34.834
- Why?

21:34.900 --> 21:36.867
- 'Cause I want reinforcements.

21:46.767 --> 21:50.200
I need a brief conversation
with Minister Said.

21:51.734 --> 21:54.367
Excuse me.

21:54.433 --> 21:56.600
May I sit?

21:56.667 --> 21:58.033
I'll come right to the point.

21:58.100 --> 21:59.700
- Please do.

21:59.767 --> 22:01.033
- Me and you,
we have mutual interests.

22:01.100 --> 22:03.033
Common enemies.
Schillinger.

22:03.100 --> 22:05.100
I want him dented,
and you want him dented,

22:05.166 --> 22:06.967
and I'm hoping
we can work something out.

22:07.033 --> 22:09.533
- You were raped by Adebisi.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.133
- Yeah, well, I'm asking--

22:12.200 --> 22:14.066
- I'm answering.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.200
You look like
you may have resolved the rape

22:15.266 --> 22:17.000
in your own head.

22:17.066 --> 22:18.867
Doesn't change the facts.

22:18.934 --> 22:20.500
Here in Oz,
you will always be known

22:20.567 --> 22:23.500
as one of Adebisi's bitches.

22:23.567 --> 22:25.300
No matter what you do,
you cannot change that.

22:27.233 --> 22:29.100
- I can.

22:30.066 --> 22:31.367
- Good luck.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.834
- Thank you.

22:38.734 --> 22:41.166
- Peter.

22:41.233 --> 22:43.000
- What?

22:43.066 --> 22:44.700
- He's fucking right, you know?

22:44.767 --> 22:47.333
And we... well,

22:47.400 --> 22:49.033
you're our paisan,

22:49.100 --> 22:51.100
but we decided

22:51.166 --> 22:52.367
we're not going after the Aryans

22:52.433 --> 22:55.333
unless Pancamo gives the word.

22:58.100 --> 22:59.734
- Fuck all of yous.

23:10.433 --> 23:11.433
- Hey.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.467
What can I do for you?

23:13.533 --> 23:14.834
- I came to pick up
the pool table.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.200
- Yeah, is it fixed yet?

23:16.266 --> 23:18.567
- Yeah, the ball return
was a little hinky,

23:18.633 --> 23:19.567
but I un-hinkied it.

23:19.633 --> 23:21.367
- Hey.

23:21.433 --> 23:22.400
You got the toaster done?

23:22.467 --> 23:24.166
- Hold your Calvins, boccie boy.

23:24.233 --> 23:25.734
I'm in the middle of something.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.000
- Yeah, well,
I got lunch coming,

23:27.066 --> 23:28.500
so these jokers can wait.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.033
- We don't wait for wops.

23:31.100 --> 23:32.800
- Someone's gonna
teach you manners, Vernon.

23:32.867 --> 23:35.000
- Yeah, well,
it ain't gonna be you, prag.

23:38.066 --> 23:39.000
- Whoa, look out!

23:47.066 --> 23:48.333
- Fuck off!

23:48.400 --> 23:50.333
Let me up!

23:50.400 --> 23:51.834
- You know--
- Let me up!

23:51.900 --> 23:53.934
- I always wondered...

23:55.266 --> 23:57.033
Was Adebisi's dick
bigger than mine?

23:57.100 --> 23:59.767
- Ah! Fuck you!
both:

23:59.834 --> 24:01.200
- Fuck you!

24:01.266 --> 24:03.200
No!

24:03.266 --> 24:05.433
- You be the judge.
- No!

24:05.500 --> 24:06.700
- I managed
to stop the bleeding,

24:06.767 --> 24:08.700
but he's still in
pretty bad shape.

24:14.200 --> 24:16.233
- Take him to the psych ward.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.633
- Oh, yeah.

24:24.700 --> 24:26.300
Pool table's working good now.

24:30.400 --> 24:33.333
- Have you been working
for the warden for a long time?

24:33.400 --> 24:36.500
- Not that long,
but long enough.

24:36.567 --> 24:38.500
- I'm the one who saved
Glynn's life, you know.

24:38.567 --> 24:39.834
Mm-hmm.

24:39.900 --> 24:41.834
'Cause when Clayton Hughes
was gonna stab him,

24:41.900 --> 24:44.667
I grabbed Hughes,
and I pulled him off.

24:44.734 --> 24:45.934
- Oh.

24:47.233 --> 24:49.734
- You're very pretty.
- Thank you.

24:53.734 --> 24:56.600
I've been in Solitary
for almost a year,

24:56.667 --> 24:58.934
and you're the first real woman
I've seen since I got out.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.433
- Real woman?

25:00.500 --> 25:03.200
- Well, there's, you know,
there's the female hacks.

25:04.300 --> 25:06.333
- Penders, come in.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.700
- Okay.
Bye.

25:10.767 --> 25:12.734
- Now!

25:15.600 --> 25:17.633
Close the door.

25:24.867 --> 25:27.133
What can I do for you?

25:27.200 --> 25:29.967
- Well, I'm out of Solitary,
and I want to stay out,

25:30.033 --> 25:31.467
so I think the best thing
for me to do

25:31.533 --> 25:34.834
is to avoid any... altercations,

25:34.900 --> 25:36.166
which means as little face time

25:36.233 --> 25:38.200
with the other prisoners
as possible.

25:38.266 --> 25:40.667
So I want to know if,
instead of working in the shop,

25:40.734 --> 25:42.100
if you can give me a job here.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.500
- In my office?
- Yes.

25:43.567 --> 25:45.100
- No.
- Warden, that--

25:45.166 --> 25:46.834
- Don't say I owe you.

25:46.900 --> 25:48.900
I have a very negative
reaction to that.

25:48.967 --> 25:50.834
Your presence here
would only remind me

25:50.900 --> 25:52.100
on a day-to-day basis

25:52.166 --> 25:53.667
of what happened
to Clayton Hughes,

25:53.734 --> 25:56.233
so the answer is no.

25:56.300 --> 25:57.367
In fact...

25:57.433 --> 25:59.500
if you see me coming, hide,

25:59.567 --> 26:00.667
because the best thing for me

26:00.734 --> 26:02.500
is to stick you back
in Solitary.

26:02.567 --> 26:04.333
Stay out of my sight.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.333
Okay?
Officer!

26:06.400 --> 26:07.333
- Warden, that's not right.

26:08.500 --> 26:09.533
That's not right.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.567
- Bye.
- That's not right.

26:13.767 --> 26:15.633
- Wet dreams are the best.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.133
You start having them
at, like, 12 years old.

26:18.200 --> 26:19.800
Every other night,
you're making love

26:19.867 --> 26:21.700
to the most beautiful women
in the world--

26:21.767 --> 26:24.100
Pam Grier, Barbi Benton,

26:24.166 --> 26:25.800
even the lovely little
Jodie Jensen

26:25.867 --> 26:27.567
in your fifth grade homeroom.

26:27.633 --> 26:28.767
Then you grow up,

26:28.834 --> 26:30.467
and the wet dreams happen
less frequently,

26:30.533 --> 26:32.800
but now you're getting
the real thing, so who cares?

26:32.867 --> 26:35.333
Until one day you realize
the woman that you're with,

26:35.400 --> 26:36.967
maybe even married to,

26:37.033 --> 26:40.467
don't look like Barbi Benton,
ain't fucking like Pam Grier,

26:40.533 --> 26:42.667
and will never love you
as purely and innocently

26:42.734 --> 26:44.300
as little Jodie Jensen.

26:44.367 --> 26:46.000
Wet dreams.

26:46.066 --> 26:48.867
A boy don't know
how good he's got it.

26:48.934 --> 26:51.333
- This new law
brings the death penalty

26:51.400 --> 26:52.834
back to our state

26:52.900 --> 26:55.166
and limits
a condemned man's choices

26:55.233 --> 26:58.600
to either lethal injection
or the electric chair,

26:58.667 --> 27:02.000
and I'm confident
that this version

27:02.066 --> 27:03.900
will sustain
all judicial review.

27:03.967 --> 27:05.266
And once again,

27:05.333 --> 27:07.667
our message to miscreants
is clear:

27:07.734 --> 27:10.667
stop murdering our families.

27:10.734 --> 27:12.433
Stop the violence.

27:14.500 --> 27:17.066
- Tobias,
would you like to sit here?

27:18.200 --> 27:19.867
- No, why?

27:19.934 --> 27:21.900
- You're gonna hurt your neck
straining like that.

27:23.533 --> 27:25.967
- It's just...

27:26.033 --> 27:27.900
Keller's coming back
from Cedar Junction today.

27:27.967 --> 27:29.133
- We know.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.633
- I haven't seen him in months.

27:30.700 --> 27:32.767
I'm a little anxious.

27:32.834 --> 27:33.767
How do I look?

27:33.834 --> 27:35.967
- Anxious.

27:36.033 --> 27:38.467
- I was hoping
you were gonna say fuckable.

27:38.533 --> 27:40.567
- Misdeal.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.333
- Warden!

27:46.400 --> 27:48.467
I'm touched you came down
to welcome me home.

27:48.533 --> 27:50.000
Where's the red carpet
and the marching band?

27:50.066 --> 27:51.300
- Cut the jokes, Keller.

27:51.367 --> 27:53.000
- Yes, sir.

27:53.066 --> 27:55.333
You know, I want you to know,
this time around,

27:55.400 --> 27:57.166
I intend to be a model prisoner.

27:57.233 --> 27:59.467
Gonna be the best-behaved man
in Emerald City.

27:59.533 --> 28:00.700
- That'll be fine,

28:00.767 --> 28:03.166
except you're not going
to Emerald City.

28:03.233 --> 28:05.066
- No?
Where, B?

28:05.133 --> 28:08.000
- For the time being,
you'll be in protective custody.

28:08.066 --> 28:11.133
- Protective custody... why?

28:11.200 --> 28:12.934
- You'll see.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.900
After he changes clothes,
take him to interview room two.

28:28.700 --> 28:31.667
- Well, well, well,
Agent Taylor, what a surprise.

28:31.734 --> 28:33.600
- Sit.

28:35.700 --> 28:38.166
- I been riding hump all day,
I prefer to stand.

28:38.233 --> 28:40.800
- Suit yourself.

28:40.867 --> 28:42.633
State of Massachusetts
let you out of prison

28:42.700 --> 28:45.133
because Gaetano Cincetta
says you didn't hire him

28:45.200 --> 28:46.433
to kill Hank Schillinger.

28:46.500 --> 28:49.967
He says
Chucky Pancamo hired him.

28:50.033 --> 28:53.467
- That's old news, Spanky.
- True.

28:53.533 --> 28:55.633
But one question, though.

28:55.700 --> 28:57.500
Why would you confess
to hiring Cincetta

28:57.567 --> 28:58.533
when you didn't?

28:58.600 --> 29:00.667
Why would you cover for Pancamo?

29:00.734 --> 29:02.767
- I owed him.
- You're lying.

29:02.834 --> 29:03.867
- Prove it.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.567
- I do have one piece
of new news for you, though.

29:08.633 --> 29:11.066
The Brice Tibbetts murder case.

29:13.333 --> 29:16.266
A witness has come forward.

29:16.333 --> 29:18.600
Imagine that.

29:18.667 --> 29:20.266
After all this time,

29:20.333 --> 29:23.934
a citizen decides to step up
and do the right thing.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.867
This citizen picked your picture
out of a mug file.

29:27.934 --> 29:29.467
Tomorrow you and I
are gonna drive into town

29:29.533 --> 29:32.900
and see whether he or she
can pick you out of a lineup.

29:34.533 --> 29:37.066
In the meantime,
we're keeping you isolated.

29:37.133 --> 29:39.633
But don't get
too comfortable, though.

29:39.700 --> 29:42.900
Your real home's
gonna be death row.

29:42.967 --> 29:47.567
Officer...
put this caviar on ice.

29:53.700 --> 29:55.734
- Put an "X" on that one.

29:57.367 --> 29:59.133
- Hey.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.867
- Hey, how'd your meeting go
with Freddy Rudolph?

30:00.934 --> 30:02.233
- Good.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.333
We're feeling very positive
about his parole.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.333
- Excellent.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.200
- Well, I mean,

30:07.266 --> 30:09.300
I said that before, didn't I?

30:11.066 --> 30:14.100
- Will you stop
beating yourself up, Catherine?

30:14.166 --> 30:16.500
You did the best
you could for me.

30:19.567 --> 30:21.166
I have to go.

30:21.233 --> 30:23.000
Come here.
Give Daddy a kiss.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.600
I love you.

30:28.900 --> 30:30.233
Will you give Daddy a kiss?

30:30.300 --> 30:31.667
- Yes.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.367
- Mmm, you smell good.

30:38.433 --> 30:40.033
I'll see you on Saturday,
okay, dumpling?

30:40.100 --> 30:41.633
- Bye.

30:46.767 --> 30:49.467
- So, Officer Howell...

30:51.433 --> 30:52.533
You and me are gonna be spending

30:52.600 --> 30:55.066
an awful lot of time
together, huh?

30:55.133 --> 30:56.767
- Think you can handle that,
tough guy?

30:56.834 --> 30:59.433
- Well, I know if I can't,
you'll make me.

31:00.767 --> 31:01.700
Hey, Sister Pete.

31:01.767 --> 31:03.200
- Hello, Chris.

31:03.266 --> 31:05.367
May we speak privately?

31:05.433 --> 31:07.800
- Knock yourself out, Sister.

31:11.400 --> 31:12.433
- How are you?

31:12.500 --> 31:15.166
- Off-balance.

31:15.233 --> 31:16.500
Yesterday,
I was in Cedar Junction

31:16.567 --> 31:18.767
serving life
on a murder for hire,

31:18.834 --> 31:19.934
and all of a sudden,
they tell me,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
"Oh, you're not guilty for that.

31:22.066 --> 31:23.533
You're going back to Oz."

31:23.600 --> 31:24.767
I'm on the bus,

31:24.834 --> 31:26.367
I'm looking forward
to coming back here,

31:26.433 --> 31:27.667
and the FBI tells me

31:27.734 --> 31:29.166
that they got a witness
against me

31:29.233 --> 31:31.000
for an old murder rap.

31:32.400 --> 31:35.000
I'm facing the death penalty.

31:35.066 --> 31:38.166
- What you need
is a good lawyer.

31:39.400 --> 31:41.200
- Yeah, you know of any?

31:41.266 --> 31:43.333
- I'll find somebody.

31:44.767 --> 31:47.700
If you need anything else,
give me a holler.

31:47.767 --> 31:49.667
- Sister Pete?

31:53.934 --> 31:56.033
I want to spend
some time with Beecher.

31:57.100 --> 31:58.700
- I'll see what I can do.

32:00.500 --> 32:03.266
- The death penalty?

32:03.333 --> 32:04.700
Christ.

32:04.767 --> 32:06.367
- I'm hoping
Catherine McClain will recommend

32:06.433 --> 32:08.200
a lawyer from her office.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.367
- Catherine.
Yeah, that's a good idea.

32:11.433 --> 32:15.133
- Meanwhile, I'll ask the warden
about all the specifics.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.934
- While you're there,
will you ask him...

32:19.400 --> 32:20.934
I'd like some time with Keller.

32:22.066 --> 32:23.967
- I'll see what I can do.

32:24.033 --> 32:25.867
- The answer is no!

32:25.934 --> 32:27.100
- May I ask why?

32:27.166 --> 32:29.000
- You can ask,
but you won't like the reason.

32:29.066 --> 32:30.834
- Try me.

32:30.900 --> 32:33.500
- Chris Keller tortured,
sexually abused,

32:33.567 --> 32:35.166
and murdered three men.

32:35.233 --> 32:37.700
Why should I try
to make him happy?

32:37.767 --> 32:39.333
- And Beecher?

32:39.400 --> 32:41.000
- Beecher is once again
the victim

32:41.066 --> 32:42.700
of someone else's excesses.

32:42.767 --> 32:45.000
- Oh, come on.
- This discussion is over.

32:45.066 --> 32:48.300
- Leo!
- This discussion is over!

33:00.633 --> 33:02.033
- You know
when you're driving in your car

33:02.100 --> 33:04.367
or maybe taking a shower,
and suddenly,

33:04.433 --> 33:06.533
you remember
some great dream you had,

33:06.600 --> 33:09.533
and that dream made you feel
so good or bad or whatever,

33:09.600 --> 33:12.066
you can't help but try
to recapture every detail.

33:12.133 --> 33:13.066
The next thing you know,

33:13.133 --> 33:14.066
you missed your exit ramp,

33:14.133 --> 33:15.367
or the hot water's gone cold.

33:15.433 --> 33:17.967
Well, in Oz,
if you take a shower,

33:18.033 --> 33:20.300
and you space off,
even for a second,

33:20.367 --> 33:23.166
some cocksucker is sure
to shank you in the back.

33:23.233 --> 33:25.400
Daydreams can be deadly.

33:40.066 --> 33:41.500
- What do you want?

33:41.567 --> 33:43.667
- What do you want?

33:43.734 --> 33:45.133
- Not a thing.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.166
- Not a thing.

33:50.400 --> 33:53.166
- Robson, get out of my way.

33:53.233 --> 33:55.500
- Robson, get out of my way.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.867
- Imam, come with us.

33:57.934 --> 34:00.367
- Say another word, Robson.

34:00.433 --> 34:01.700
Say one more word,

34:01.767 --> 34:03.367
I'll snap your cracker neck,

34:03.433 --> 34:05.467
right here, right now.

34:06.767 --> 34:07.734
- Robson!

34:07.800 --> 34:10.066
Move your sorry ass onward.

34:13.533 --> 34:14.967
- Yes, sir, boss.

34:18.700 --> 34:22.834
- Imam, you have to control
the anger in your heart.

34:22.900 --> 34:24.300
Remember the words of Allah.

34:24.367 --> 34:26.000
- What words would
those be, Arif?

34:26.066 --> 34:29.200
What advice would
Allah have for me?

34:39.900 --> 34:42.433
- Look, I don't mean
to speak beyond my position,

34:42.500 --> 34:43.600
but he has got serious--

34:43.667 --> 34:46.000
- I know
what you're thinking, Ahmad,

34:46.066 --> 34:48.667
but Minister Said
is a great man.

34:48.734 --> 34:50.166
He's having troubles
right now.

34:50.233 --> 34:52.333
That is why
we must not abandon him.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.667
- No, no, not abandon him.

34:53.734 --> 34:55.667
Of course not, he's our brother.

34:55.734 --> 34:58.000
But is he the one to lead us?

34:58.066 --> 34:59.000
Look, I feel that he has got--

34:59.066 --> 35:01.266
- Enough!

35:01.333 --> 35:03.433
Help me pick up these beads.

35:06.567 --> 35:09.033
- Did you ever use drugs?
- No, ma'am.

35:09.100 --> 35:10.533
Not so much
as a marijuana cigarette

35:10.600 --> 35:12.800
has ever touched my lips.

35:12.867 --> 35:14.066
- I have.

35:15.367 --> 35:16.800
Heroin.

35:16.867 --> 35:17.967
Crack cocaine.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.900
- Kareem?
- What?

35:20.967 --> 35:23.400
You thought my journey
to Allah was easy?

35:23.467 --> 35:26.000
- No, it's just that...

35:26.066 --> 35:27.600
when I was using,
you never said--

35:27.667 --> 35:30.834
- That is a period of my life
of which I am not very proud of.

35:30.900 --> 35:31.967
- Hmm.

35:32.033 --> 35:34.166
Unlike now?

35:47.800 --> 35:49.500
- Follow me.

35:49.567 --> 35:51.166
- Yo, man,
what's up with that?

35:51.233 --> 35:52.900
"Miss Sally"
is on the TV, man.

35:52.967 --> 35:54.333
- I said come.

36:03.800 --> 36:04.800
What are you doing with Poet?

36:04.867 --> 36:05.934
- Poet? What, nothing.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.233
- He wasn't trying
to sell you drugs?

36:07.300 --> 36:08.734
- Come on, man.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.433
Only titties we was talking
about was Miss Sally's, man.

36:10.500 --> 36:13.033
- You are not to talk to him.

36:13.100 --> 36:14.800
- Why, what's up with that?
We just snapping.

36:14.867 --> 36:15.800
That's my boy, we go back.

36:15.867 --> 36:17.467
- What'd I just say?

36:17.533 --> 36:20.800
Now, remember,
one word from me to McManus,

36:20.867 --> 36:22.667
and you go straight back
to Solitary.

36:24.133 --> 36:26.200
Now, go.

36:26.266 --> 36:28.300
Straighten out your cell.

36:29.734 --> 36:30.900
Hey!

36:32.033 --> 36:33.633
Now, you better obey me.

36:51.900 --> 36:53.500
- Oh, dude.

36:53.567 --> 36:55.667
You look like
you need some bounce, bro.

36:55.734 --> 36:57.734
Shitload of tits came in today.

36:57.800 --> 36:58.967
- Step off, bro.

36:59.033 --> 37:02.000
You know I can't be doing
no drugs and shit.

37:02.066 --> 37:03.834
Motherfucker Said's
watching me 24/7, man.

37:03.900 --> 37:05.667
Glynn has me tested
once a week and shit.

37:05.734 --> 37:09.500
- Well, yo, last year,
Glynn was having me tested, man.

37:09.567 --> 37:11.200
I got the way around that.

37:11.266 --> 37:12.567
You know Billy Plana?

37:12.633 --> 37:14.734
- Mm-mm.
- He works bedpan.

37:14.800 --> 37:18.133
He pissed for me,
then switched the cups out.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.066
You could pay, right?

37:21.300 --> 37:24.000
Well, he'd piss for me,
he'd piss for you.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.967
- Hook me up.
- I got you, dawg.

37:29.033 --> 37:30.100
- Omar?

37:30.166 --> 37:31.467
- Oh, fuck.
- Omar?

37:31.533 --> 37:32.567
- Fuck.

37:34.033 --> 37:36.100
- Oh, man.

37:39.567 --> 37:40.734
- Open your hand.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.033
- Yeah, I was just--

37:42.100 --> 37:43.300
- Be quiet.

37:44.367 --> 37:45.900
Open your hand.

37:49.133 --> 37:51.166
Give it to me.

37:52.900 --> 37:54.934
- Damn.

38:01.633 --> 38:03.667
- You forget Omar White exists.

38:05.233 --> 38:07.266
I'm not gonna
warn you again, Poet.

38:08.433 --> 38:10.567
- Fuck this shit, man.
- Yo, yo, yo, Poet, man.

38:10.633 --> 38:11.834
My cap, man.

38:11.900 --> 38:13.934
Fuck, he got all my money.

38:18.367 --> 38:20.700
I should be working and shit,
you know what I mean?

38:26.700 --> 38:28.066
- Omar didn't actually
take a hit?

38:28.133 --> 38:29.967
- No.
- Well, good.

38:30.033 --> 38:32.133
- But he will.
He'll find another dealer.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.300
By day's end, he'll be high.

38:34.367 --> 38:36.800
- Well, yeah, all right.

38:36.867 --> 38:38.367
Let me know if he uses.

38:38.433 --> 38:40.133
- McManus.

38:40.200 --> 38:41.633
That's all you have to say?

38:41.700 --> 38:43.667
- Well,
what do you want me to say?

38:43.734 --> 38:45.800
- Wait a minute,
you asked me to help White.

38:45.867 --> 38:46.967
You asked me to save him.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.000
- Yeah.

38:48.066 --> 38:49.333
- In the process,

38:49.400 --> 38:50.800
you convinced me
that if I can turn him around,

38:50.867 --> 38:53.000
I might find a way
past my own troubles.

38:53.066 --> 38:56.500
- Mm-hmm.
- I bought in, McManus.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.166
I bought in
hook, line, and sinker.

38:58.233 --> 39:00.333
I'm still buying.

39:00.400 --> 39:03.500
Now, I need this to succeed,
for my own soul.

39:03.567 --> 39:05.000
- I know.

39:05.066 --> 39:06.400
- So why you refusing
to help me?

39:06.467 --> 39:08.000
- I'm not refusing anything.

39:08.066 --> 39:09.500
I got nothing to offer.

39:09.567 --> 39:11.166
Said, this is all on you.

39:11.233 --> 39:13.767
Omar White
is the million dollar question.

39:13.834 --> 39:14.934
There's an answer,

39:15.000 --> 39:16.800
but I'm never gonna
come up with it.

39:16.867 --> 39:19.100
I believe you can.

39:19.166 --> 39:21.100
I'm basically a spectator now,

39:21.166 --> 39:23.734
but I think
your instincts can find the key.

39:23.800 --> 39:27.834
If not, we're all fucked.

39:39.367 --> 39:45.133
- Omar, when you finish up,
come see me.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.133
- Yo, man, look.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.567
Yo, you're making
my motherfucking head hurt,

39:48.633 --> 39:49.800
all right?

39:49.867 --> 39:50.800
I don't feel like
hearing no goddamn

39:50.867 --> 39:52.133
drug speech now, shit!

39:52.200 --> 39:53.333
- We're not gonna
talk about drugs.

39:53.400 --> 39:54.700
- Then what?

39:54.767 --> 39:56.500
- I don't know, anything,
just a conversation.

39:56.567 --> 39:59.934
- Look, I don't want to have
no damn conversation now.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.700
All right?
Shit.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.600
- We're gonna have
a conversation anyway.

40:07.066 --> 40:08.266
You understand me?

40:09.233 --> 40:10.367
Now...

40:10.433 --> 40:13.834
What is your favorite color?

40:13.900 --> 40:15.467
Answer.

40:15.533 --> 40:17.000
- White.
- White.

40:17.066 --> 40:19.100
Why is that?
'Cause your name, right?

40:21.900 --> 40:23.834
- It's clean and shit.

40:23.900 --> 40:24.867
- Fine.

40:24.934 --> 40:26.100
One more.

40:27.567 --> 40:28.667
What was the last thing

40:28.734 --> 40:31.800
that you were
really passionate about?

40:33.967 --> 40:35.333
- You know,
tell you the truth, man,

40:35.400 --> 40:37.367
I don't think
I ever gave a shit about shit.

40:37.433 --> 40:39.767
- Oh, come, man,
there must've been something.

40:39.834 --> 40:40.767
- Nothing.
- Come on.

40:40.834 --> 40:41.767
Something you wanted to do.

40:41.834 --> 40:42.934
Something you wanted to be.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.433
Come on, Omar.
Give me something.

40:44.500 --> 40:46.066
Give me something.

40:48.767 --> 40:49.967
- Cowboy.

40:51.767 --> 40:53.000
That's right.

40:53.066 --> 40:55.600
Motherfucking black cowboy,
Jack, yeah.

40:55.667 --> 40:57.367
When I was a kid,
you know, I saw...

40:57.433 --> 40:59.867
I saw this movie
from the olden days and shit

40:59.934 --> 41:03.400
with... Herb Jeffries.

41:03.467 --> 41:04.867
Yeah, what was it called?

41:04.934 --> 41:08.066
"The Bronze Buckaroo" and shit.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.834
That's it.
- Black B Westerns.

41:09.900 --> 41:12.000
Black movies,
all black cowboys,

41:12.066 --> 41:14.233
made for black audiences
in the late '30s.

41:15.734 --> 41:17.834
So, guns and horses, huh?

41:19.734 --> 41:21.333
- Yo, man, never mind

41:21.400 --> 41:23.367
the motherfucking guns
and horses.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.433
That motherfucker
Herb Jeffries...

41:29.734 --> 41:31.367
He could sing.

41:31.433 --> 41:33.333
- So, this is excellent.

41:33.400 --> 41:34.667
- What's excellent?

41:34.734 --> 41:36.500
- Well,
you've identified an interest,

41:36.567 --> 41:38.834
and that's
an important step forward.

41:38.900 --> 41:40.767
See,
finding the right activity

41:40.834 --> 41:42.700
a constructive way
of spending your time,

41:42.767 --> 41:44.133
can make all the difference--
do you know what?

41:44.200 --> 41:46.233
I'm gonna set up a meeting
with Suzanne Fitzgerald.

41:46.300 --> 41:47.700
- O'Reily's mother?
- That's right.

41:47.767 --> 41:49.433
She's doing
community service work here.

41:49.500 --> 41:50.934
- Why am I meeting who?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.367
- She teaches singing.

41:53.433 --> 41:56.400
- Yo, that all sounds great
and shit, except for one thing.

41:56.467 --> 41:57.834
I can't sing.

41:57.900 --> 42:00.000
- "Can't" never
did anything, Omar.

42:00.066 --> 42:01.767
- What does that mean?

42:01.834 --> 42:03.266
- I don't understand.

42:03.333 --> 42:04.867
You're pissed because
we've started a music program?

42:04.934 --> 42:08.033
- No, no, I'm pissed because
I'm just hearing about it.

42:08.100 --> 42:10.300
I'm the state liaison,
for Chrissake.

42:10.367 --> 42:12.300
- Oh, and you have to report
everything back to your pal,

42:12.367 --> 42:13.700
the governor.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.500
- Leo.

42:16.567 --> 42:18.500
There's no money in the budget
for a music program.

42:18.567 --> 42:20.333
How do you expect
to pay the freight?

42:20.400 --> 42:22.834
- Well, Suzanne Fitzgerald
is donating her time.

42:22.900 --> 42:24.166
The other costs are minimal.

42:24.233 --> 42:25.500
I'll do what I always do.

42:25.567 --> 42:27.300
Take a little from here,
a little from there.

42:27.367 --> 42:28.934
- The arts
are an important part of life.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.367
- Oh, really?

42:30.433 --> 42:32.233
I couldn't get you
anywhere near

42:32.300 --> 42:34.166
a theater and art gallery
when we were married,

42:34.233 --> 42:36.233
especially
if there was football on TV.

42:36.300 --> 42:38.967
- Ellie, I really think
this program can help

42:39.033 --> 42:40.133
some of these guys.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.266
- Tim,
you're setting yourself up

42:42.333 --> 42:43.567
for another fall.

42:43.633 --> 42:45.633
You always bet everything
on the impossible.

42:45.700 --> 42:47.600
- That's not true.
- Yeah?

42:47.667 --> 42:48.800
Look at us.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.233
Get an estimate of the cost.

42:53.300 --> 42:57.166
I'll see if I can wrangle
some cash from Devlin.

43:01.266 --> 43:03.967
- You were very smart
in marrying her.

43:05.100 --> 43:06.433
- Mm.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.967
- She was very smart
in divorcing you.

43:11.100 --> 43:12.333
- So, I ain't gotta sing?

43:12.400 --> 43:15.467
- No, you don't have to sing.
- I don't?

43:15.533 --> 43:17.633
- But I do encourage you
to try at least once,

43:17.700 --> 43:19.066
before we give up.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.800
- My voice ain't no good.

43:22.867 --> 43:24.667
I mean, it's too deep.

43:24.734 --> 43:28.166
Like Barry White,
you know, just bad.

43:28.233 --> 43:30.667
- You know what, I think
you might be more of a tenor,

43:30.734 --> 43:32.333
so let's try this.

43:32.400 --> 43:35.834
♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah ♪

43:35.900 --> 43:36.834
You try.

43:38.900 --> 43:42.934
- You know, you sure
are a fine-looking woman.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.500
- Okay, well, new idea.

43:46.567 --> 43:50.834
Let's try starting
with a song, okay?

43:50.900 --> 43:52.834
I bet you know this one.

43:52.900 --> 43:55.834
♪ Jesus loves me, this I know ♪

43:55.900 --> 44:00.400
♪ For the Bible tells me so ♪

44:00.467 --> 44:03.867
♪ Little ones to him belong ♪

44:03.934 --> 44:05.533
♪ They are weak,
but he is strong ♪

44:05.600 --> 44:08.934
- I know that, that's...
that's "Jesus Loves Me."

44:09.000 --> 44:11.533
- ♪ Yes, Jesus loves me ♪

44:11.600 --> 44:13.967
♪ Yes, Jesus loves me ♪

44:14.033 --> 44:16.467
♪ Yes, Jesus loves me ♪

44:16.533 --> 44:19.367
♪ The Bible tells me so ♪

44:19.433 --> 44:22.033
- See, now, you--
you a singer.

44:22.100 --> 44:23.800
- It's your turn.

44:26.533 --> 44:29.133
- I heard...

44:29.200 --> 44:30.967
I heard you was O'Reily's moms.

44:31.033 --> 44:32.734
- That's true.

44:35.400 --> 44:38.667
- Growing up...
you make him sing too?

44:38.734 --> 44:40.767
No.

44:40.834 --> 44:43.000
- Why not?

44:43.066 --> 44:44.500
- It's a long story.

44:47.233 --> 44:48.700
- So is mine.

44:48.767 --> 44:51.166
- Omar, you know,
I'm not asking for the world.

44:51.233 --> 44:52.166
- Damn!

44:53.500 --> 44:54.667
I mean, I try to be graceful
up in here, right?

44:54.734 --> 44:55.867
I'm trying, all right?

44:55.934 --> 44:57.834
You said
I didn't have to sing, right?

44:57.900 --> 45:00.500
- I said I wanted you to try.
Now, sit back down, please.

45:00.567 --> 45:01.834
- Motherfucking liar, man.

45:01.900 --> 45:03.533
Everybody's always
fucking lying!

45:03.600 --> 45:05.166
- Officer Brass!

45:06.500 --> 45:08.033
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

45:09.367 --> 45:10.367
I'm sorry.
I take it back.

45:10.433 --> 45:12.300
I'm sorry.
I take it back.

45:12.367 --> 45:13.300
Forgive me, I didn't--

45:13.367 --> 45:15.667
- Suzanne, you all right?

45:15.734 --> 45:16.667
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

45:16.734 --> 45:19.033
Shh, shh, shh, it's okay.

45:19.100 --> 45:21.300
- Get off the floor,
you fucking mutt!

45:21.367 --> 45:23.633
- Stand up.

45:23.700 --> 45:25.066
Let's try again.
Come on.

45:25.133 --> 45:26.834
Sit down.

45:31.033 --> 45:32.567
Come on.

45:35.033 --> 45:37.200
Want to try this?

45:37.266 --> 45:40.500
- I heard once that every person
in your dream is actually you.

45:40.567 --> 45:41.700
Even if you're dreaming
about you

45:41.767 --> 45:44.000
and some motherfucker
you can't stand,

45:44.066 --> 45:45.967
you're actually dreaming
about you--

45:46.033 --> 45:47.333
And the motherfucker
part of yourself

45:47.400 --> 45:48.967
you can't stand.

45:51.567 --> 45:54.266
- Your mother got all riled up
about civil rights.

45:55.900 --> 45:58.767
Hell, things wasn't as bad
as they was in the South.

46:00.233 --> 46:02.333
But she dragged your daddy
on down to D.C.

46:02.400 --> 46:03.867
to hear Dr. King.

46:03.934 --> 46:06.400
To join the march.

46:06.467 --> 46:08.000
- And you didn't go?

46:08.066 --> 46:10.033
- No.

46:10.100 --> 46:11.633
I stayed in town,

46:11.700 --> 46:14.033
waiting on something better
to come along.

46:16.200 --> 46:19.133
Your parents were part
of the most important event

46:19.200 --> 46:21.300
of the 20th century.

46:21.367 --> 46:25.033
And here I am,
two days into a five-day drunk.

46:26.033 --> 46:29.300
- I miss Mama so fuckin' much.

46:29.367 --> 46:31.400
- I know, I know.

46:34.033 --> 46:36.133
- I got a postcard
from my honey.

46:36.200 --> 46:37.467
She's in Maui.

46:37.533 --> 46:39.333
- Oh, yeah, Maui?
Man, Maui's awesome.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.967
You know you can actually climb
down into a volcano there?

46:42.033 --> 46:45.533
And the women,
they got great, great...

46:45.600 --> 46:47.467
They got great
inner beauty, man.

46:47.533 --> 46:48.934
- You been to Maui?

46:49.000 --> 46:50.333
- No, I just read it
in "National Pornographic."

46:50.400 --> 46:52.367
You know,
lots of color photos and shit.

46:52.433 --> 46:53.533
- Does it bother you

46:53.600 --> 46:56.200
that your girlfriend
is in Hawaii, Chico?

46:57.500 --> 46:59.000
- No,
I know Consuela still loves me,

46:59.066 --> 47:01.000
and I want her to be having
a good time and all,

47:01.066 --> 47:02.800
but that postcard,

47:02.867 --> 47:05.066
it really ripped my heart out,
you know?

47:05.133 --> 47:06.700
Places I'll never see.

47:06.767 --> 47:09.600
- There are worse things than
your woman going on vacation.

47:09.667 --> 47:10.900
- Yeah, like what?

47:10.967 --> 47:13.433
- She could leave you.

47:13.500 --> 47:14.934
She could send you
a letter one day and say,

47:15.000 --> 47:16.266
you know,
she thinks the time has come

47:16.333 --> 47:17.900
for her to move on
with her life.

47:18.867 --> 47:20.734
I'm saying...

47:22.200 --> 47:24.300
I thought the worst thing
that could happen to me was

47:24.367 --> 47:26.800
losing my legs--
losing my freedom--

47:26.867 --> 47:29.400
but Annabella, that's...

47:30.700 --> 47:32.734
Like losing my manhood.

47:34.033 --> 47:36.133
Another big chunk of who I am.

48:06.400 --> 48:09.100
- I wish I could understand you.

48:18.033 --> 48:19.934
- Jaz Hoyt's sitting in the Hole

48:20.000 --> 48:22.767
because of
the Reverend Cloutier.

48:22.834 --> 48:24.133
You work the mail room,
don't you, Gunner?

48:24.200 --> 48:26.133
- Yeah.
- Great.

48:26.200 --> 48:27.467
Make sure today
that you're the one

48:27.533 --> 48:29.000
pushing around the mail cart.

48:29.066 --> 48:31.633
Make sure you do deliveries
to the hospital ward.

48:31.700 --> 48:34.834
And when you get there,
waste Cloutier.

48:34.900 --> 48:36.467
- How?

48:36.533 --> 48:39.567
- I'm told
a lot of burn victims suffocate.

48:49.033 --> 48:50.967
- There you go, dago.

48:51.033 --> 48:53.066
- Fuck you, punk.

49:20.500 --> 49:23.100
- What's this doing here?

49:23.166 --> 49:26.100
- I guess Cloutier's got mail.

49:26.166 --> 49:29.767
- Officer! Officer!

49:29.834 --> 49:33.166
Officer!
Officer!

49:33.233 --> 49:34.900
- Damn it!

49:34.967 --> 49:38.233
- Get the fuck off him!

49:42.200 --> 49:44.900
- Okay, okay, okay.

49:44.967 --> 49:46.834
Look at me.
Look at me.

49:53.367 --> 49:54.433
- Where's Gunner?

49:54.500 --> 49:57.266
- In Solitary.
- And Cloutier?

49:57.333 --> 49:58.266
- Alive.

49:58.333 --> 49:59.800
- Shit!

49:59.867 --> 50:01.800
Now I gotta tell Jaz.

50:01.867 --> 50:04.166
- Come here.
- What, what, what?

50:04.233 --> 50:05.834
- I saw him.
- Saw who?

50:05.900 --> 50:08.166
- Cloutier, in the Hole,

50:08.233 --> 50:10.333
all of a sudden, he appears,
looking healthy.

50:10.400 --> 50:12.700
- You were dreaming.
- I saw him.

50:12.767 --> 50:14.000
- That's crazy.

50:14.066 --> 50:16.333
- I saw him
just like Jim Burns saw him.

50:16.400 --> 50:18.200
- Jim Burns is dead.
You killed him.

50:18.266 --> 50:19.667
- We killed him.
- Okay, look.

50:19.734 --> 50:20.767
Relax, all right?

50:20.834 --> 50:22.867
- Fuck you, "relax."

50:36.900 --> 50:38.700
- Put the cigarette out.

50:38.767 --> 50:40.867
- Okay, okay.

50:40.934 --> 50:42.700
- Smoking's bad for you, Jaz.

50:42.767 --> 50:44.133
- Yeah, I know.

50:45.800 --> 50:47.300
Oh, shit.

50:47.367 --> 50:49.233
Help!
Lopresti!

50:49.300 --> 50:51.900
Help!
- They cannot hear you.

50:54.600 --> 50:57.200
I'm in your mind.

50:57.266 --> 50:58.700
I'm all the guilt

50:58.767 --> 51:01.033
stacked up inside your soul
your whole life,

51:01.100 --> 51:03.500
ever since
you killed your first cat.

51:03.567 --> 51:05.066
And I'm not going anywhere,

51:05.133 --> 51:06.066
unless...

51:06.133 --> 51:07.500
- Unless what?

51:07.567 --> 51:09.433
- You do something for me.

51:09.500 --> 51:11.133
- Anything.

51:11.200 --> 51:14.000
- Kill Timmy Kirk.

51:14.066 --> 51:16.533
- But--
- Kill Timmy Kirk, Jaz.

51:16.600 --> 51:19.333
Or I'll be visiting you
every night

51:19.400 --> 51:21.133
for the rest of your life.

51:23.400 --> 51:24.734
- Hey!

51:24.800 --> 51:26.834
Put the cigarette out!

51:34.734 --> 51:37.500
- Dr. Nathan says that
the Reverend Cloutier's recovery

51:37.567 --> 51:40.333
is remarkable.

51:40.400 --> 51:42.500
He should be talking in weeks.

51:42.567 --> 51:44.533
- Good news.

51:44.600 --> 51:46.900
- Don't hondel me, Kirk.

51:46.967 --> 51:48.200
You were the one who arranged

51:48.266 --> 51:50.967
to have that biker
try and kill Cloutier.

51:53.100 --> 51:54.600
- How'd you like a blow job?

51:55.867 --> 51:58.567
- Kirk!
- The fuck's wrong with you?

51:58.633 --> 52:00.233
What are you--

52:00.300 --> 52:02.000
- Hoyt!
Officer!

52:08.600 --> 52:11.066
What the...
what the...

52:11.133 --> 52:12.867
- Ah!

52:21.900 --> 52:23.700
Oh, Jesus.

52:26.734 --> 52:30.667
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

52:30.734 --> 52:33.333
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

52:33.400 --> 52:34.333
Oh, no!

52:36.567 --> 52:39.333
- I confess
to the murder of Jim Burns.

52:39.400 --> 52:42.333
I confess to the murder
of Ralph Gulino.

52:42.400 --> 52:45.233
I confess
to the murder of Brian Lawlor.

52:45.300 --> 52:49.000
I confess to the murder
of Adam Decoursey.

52:49.066 --> 52:52.200
I confess
to the murder of David Horton.

52:52.266 --> 52:54.200
- Gloria, Hoyt's claiming
that Cloutier ordered him

52:54.266 --> 52:55.367
to kill Timmy Kirk.

52:55.433 --> 52:57.033
- That's insane,
Cloutier can barely move

52:57.100 --> 52:58.533
and can't even speak yet.

52:58.600 --> 52:59.533
- I don't know.

52:59.600 --> 53:00.867
Hoyt really seems to believe

53:00.934 --> 53:03.033
that Cloutier appeared
to him last night.

53:03.100 --> 53:05.200
- You think Hoyt's going
for the insanity defense

53:05.266 --> 53:06.533
to keep him off death row?

53:06.600 --> 53:08.467
- Maybe...

53:13.734 --> 53:14.967
Gloria.

53:15.033 --> 53:16.633
- Yeah?

53:16.700 --> 53:19.066
- Where is he?
- Uh...

53:19.133 --> 53:20.767
Did you move Cloutier?

53:20.834 --> 53:24.066
- No.
He was here a minute ago.

53:24.133 --> 53:26.633
- Well, now he's gone.

53:37.567 --> 53:40.000
- But on entering the tomb,

53:40.066 --> 53:42.500
I saw a young man
sitting at the right side,

53:42.567 --> 53:44.600
cloaked in a white robe.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.500
And they were amazed.

53:48.567 --> 53:50.166
He said to them,
"Do not be terrified.

53:50.233 --> 53:51.667
"You are looking
for Jesus of Nazareth,

53:51.734 --> 53:53.266
"who was crucified.

53:54.734 --> 53:56.500
He has risen."

53:56.567 --> 53:58.367
- Everybody's got
their own brand

53:58.433 --> 54:00.533
of miserable shit
to deal with in life,

54:00.600 --> 54:02.533
but if you keep
your eye on your dream,

54:02.600 --> 54:04.033
you'll pull through.

54:04.100 --> 54:07.033
In Oz, the opposite is true.

54:07.100 --> 54:08.033
The way to get through the shit

54:08.100 --> 54:10.200
is by having no dreams at all.

54:10.266 --> 54:11.967
In fact,
one of the biggest consolations

54:12.033 --> 54:14.300
for a man doing time
is knowing 90% of people

54:14.367 --> 54:17.467
in the outside world
don't realize their dreams.

54:17.533 --> 54:20.633
So, you see, we're not
really missing out on anything,

54:20.700 --> 54:22.066
are we?
