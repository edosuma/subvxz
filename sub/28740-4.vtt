00:09.052 --> 00:11.096
Come on, June.
You'll miss the big surprise.

00:14.266 --> 00:16.226
Saved the best for last, kiddo.

00:19.980 --> 00:21.732
There's three yellow men in the dirt,

00:21.857 --> 00:24.693
and this is the last thing
they ever saw.

00:25.527 --> 00:26.570
Why don't you put it on?

00:27.904 --> 00:29.281
I don't want to.

00:31.116 --> 00:32.993
- What did you say?
- John, don't start.

00:33.118 --> 00:36.580
I just want young Bing to appreciate
what's been handed down to him.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.874
Do you have a problem with that?

00:39.666 --> 00:42.419
How about I go get us
some milk and cookies?

00:43.754 --> 00:44.963
Mothers!

00:45.046 --> 00:47.382
Listen to her,
you end up a goddamn pussy.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.259
Now stand up.

00:53.180 --> 00:54.848
Put the mask on.

01:01.354 --> 01:03.023
Okay, Private Take-No-Shit.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.983
Let's see how good of
a soldier you are.

01:23.335 --> 01:24.669
Gotcha!

01:26.713 --> 01:27.881
Get up, retard.

01:29.466 --> 01:31.176
Language, John.

01:39.851 --> 01:41.603
You got me!

01:43.980 --> 01:46.566
I love you more than anything,
Bing Partridge.

02:02.874 --> 02:04.376
Hey, Bingaling.

02:05.001 --> 02:07.254
The toddler down the road
works faster than you.

02:10.257 --> 02:11.716
Lucky me.

02:12.551 --> 02:16.721
I've got a son who is slow as
molasses and dumb as a box of hair.

02:18.056 --> 02:20.600
Maybe that will light a fire
under your stupid ass.

02:41.538 --> 02:43.123
Get up, retard.

03:02.934 --> 03:04.144
Bing?

03:09.900 --> 03:13.528
Oh, Bing. Oh, my sweet boy,
what have you done?

03:14.195 --> 03:15.363
What...

04:15.507 --> 04:16.882
Steve.

04:19.803 --> 04:22.222
- Christ...
- I'm so sorry.

04:22.347 --> 04:24.891
It's those asshole cops
who should be sorry.

04:25.016 --> 04:27.519
They think Sharon took Haley
and left me.

04:28.061 --> 04:30.605
- She wouldn't do that.
- No, I know she wouldn't. I know.

04:32.899 --> 04:34.901
How am I going to tell them
the cat's dead?

04:35.944 --> 04:37.821
Who would do something like this?

05:00.427 --> 05:01.261
Hey.

05:01.845 --> 05:03.346
I got here as fast as I could.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.890
The Wraith. It took the girl
I babysit and her mom.

05:08.143 --> 05:10.103
My Scrabble bag said
he was after you.

05:10.186 --> 05:12.355
Yeah, but Haley knew about my bridge.
She saw me.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.067
I told... I told her not to go out
there, that it was dangerous.

05:17.193 --> 05:18.695
Shit, I'm sorry.

05:19.112 --> 05:20.947
I'm sorry.

05:23.158 --> 05:24.784
- Screw this.
- Wait a second.

05:24.868 --> 05:27.537
- We need to find Haley and Sharon.
- I'm going with you.

05:27.662 --> 05:29.622
No. The bridge will only open for me.

05:29.706 --> 05:31.249
I don't like you going by yourself.

05:31.374 --> 05:33.460
If I don't look for them,
Maggie, who will?

05:36.046 --> 05:37.297
Be careful.

05:46.765 --> 05:48.391
Vic?

05:48.516 --> 05:50.977
- Where did the bridge go?
- That bridge is dangerous.

05:51.102 --> 05:52.353
You're scaring me.

05:52.479 --> 05:56.441
Never, ever tell anyone about this.
Haley, you've got to promise me.

05:56.566 --> 05:57.942
I promise.

07:09.889 --> 07:11.057
Vic?

07:15.270 --> 07:17.021
Hey, what are you doing here?

07:20.400 --> 07:22.944
Bing, this is...
This is your house?

07:23.862 --> 07:24.696
Yeah.

07:26.156 --> 07:28.908
Is there...
Does anyone else live here?

07:31.369 --> 07:32.829
No, it's just me.

07:36.457 --> 07:37.292
How was college?

07:38.585 --> 07:39.919
It was good.

07:41.546 --> 07:42.839
Good.

07:43.798 --> 07:45.341
Are you lost?

07:46.885 --> 07:48.970
Sorry, no. I was, um...

07:49.554 --> 07:52.599
I was going to my friend's house.
It's weird I ended up here.

07:52.724 --> 07:54.017
Which friend?

07:54.684 --> 07:57.020
- Craig.
- Craig Harrison?

07:57.145 --> 07:59.397
- Yeah.
- He lives up the way.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.774
Yeah. I think I know
where I made a wrong turn.

08:02.859 --> 08:04.152
You know, when I get lost,

08:05.195 --> 08:07.030
I just remind myself...

08:07.614 --> 08:12.911
"Go forth to the north,
and then... then left is West."

08:14.412 --> 08:17.207
Yeah, that's smart.
Thanks, Bing.

08:23.588 --> 08:24.714
Bye.

10:07.692 --> 10:11.237
Tell me where my daughter is. What
have you done with her, you bastard?

10:12.905 --> 10:14.741
Sticks and stones,

10:15.783 --> 10:17.827
pins and tacks...

10:21.789 --> 10:24.250
Only good mommies get tasty snacks.

10:55.948 --> 10:58.993
"I love..."

11:02.663 --> 11:04.332
"I love..."

11:05.750 --> 11:09.712
I love you more than anything,
Bing Partridge.

11:32.151 --> 11:34.654
Good morning, sleepyhead.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.282
I've got quite a surprise for you.

11:39.409 --> 11:40.451
Where am I?

11:40.576 --> 11:43.204
Let me out, you creep.
Let me out!

11:43.329 --> 11:47.917
I do prefer my passengers
keep their hands to themselves.

11:49.335 --> 11:51.170
Safety first.

11:51.295 --> 11:53.089
Please, let me go.

11:53.214 --> 11:56.592
Don't get yourself in knots.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

11:57.176 --> 11:59.303
I would never hurt a child.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.472
Where's my mom?

12:01.597 --> 12:06.060
That wretched woman. She never had
your best interests in mind.

12:07.228 --> 12:08.813
Now you're with me,

12:08.938 --> 12:11.858
you'll never feel unwanted
ever again.

12:22.535 --> 12:26.122
Where are we?
Where are you taking me?

12:26.247 --> 12:30.877
Currently, we are traversing
the Saint Nick Parkway.

12:31.711 --> 12:35.465
It's my own private thoroughfare
to a wonderful place

12:36.090 --> 12:37.717
called Christmasland.

12:37.842 --> 12:39.343
Sounds stupid.

12:39.844 --> 12:41.429
Quite the contrary.

12:42.054 --> 12:46.559
Christmasland is filled
with hot cocoa and candy,

12:47.059 --> 12:48.936
and toys galore.

12:49.479 --> 12:51.272
But before I can take you,

12:51.772 --> 12:56.402
I need to know a few things
about the magic bridge in the woods.

12:56.527 --> 12:57.862
I'm not telling you anything.

12:57.987 --> 13:00.948
I simply want to know the name
of the boy who uses it.

13:01.073 --> 13:02.617
It's a girl, you idiot.

13:05.912 --> 13:09.123
The interesting ones always are.

13:29.352 --> 13:30.561
Shit.

13:48.955 --> 13:51.415
The bridge didn't work.
It took me to Bing's house.

13:51.541 --> 13:52.416
Who's Bing?

13:53.209 --> 13:54.961
The school janitor.

13:56.504 --> 13:58.339
We trade comic books.
He's a nice guy.

13:58.422 --> 13:59.549
No way he's the Wraith.

13:59.674 --> 14:01.926
- Well then maybe he's his henchman.
- What?

14:02.009 --> 14:04.554
The Wraith was working with a partner
when he took Danny.

14:04.679 --> 14:07.014
- Maybe this janitor...
- He wouldn't hurt anyone.

14:07.139 --> 14:08.766
Okay. How well do you know him?

14:08.891 --> 14:11.602
- The bridge made a mistake.
- Inscapes don't make mistakes.

14:11.727 --> 14:13.729
Well, your tiles did. "Smitten"?

14:13.854 --> 14:15.356
That was not the tiles' mistake.

14:15.439 --> 14:18.359
I misinterpreted the letters
and you are misinterpreting this.

14:18.442 --> 14:19.944
You need to trust your gift.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.989
This is not a gift, Maggie.

14:23.614 --> 14:25.074
I've got to lay down.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.292
I'll call you!

14:50.933 --> 14:52.018
Vicky?

14:53.102 --> 14:55.938
Oh, my God, you look like
you got chewed up and spit out.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.523
- Your eye is all red.
- I'm fine.

14:57.648 --> 15:00.860
- What the hell were you doing?
- Mom, Sharon and Haley are missing.

15:00.985 --> 15:03.029
- You need to breathe. What?
- Can you help?

15:03.154 --> 15:04.488
Okay. All right.

15:04.614 --> 15:06.991
Come inside. Let's get you fixed up.
Come on.

15:07.116 --> 15:08.451
It's okay.

15:09.744 --> 15:12.663
It's okay. Come on. Go upstairs.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.712
Does your dad know where you are?

15:22.465 --> 15:23.466
I don't know.

15:23.591 --> 15:25.217
Come on, into bed.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.386
No, Mom, I have them.

15:27.470 --> 15:29.930
They're probably in Florida
with Sharon's father.

15:30.056 --> 15:33.184
- No, they're not in Florida.
- You need to stop worrying, Vicky.

15:33.309 --> 15:34.518
They're fine.

15:36.646 --> 15:38.022
Come on.

15:40.274 --> 15:43.611
You have got to start
taking care of yourself, Vicky.

15:45.154 --> 15:47.031
You're the only kid I got.

15:56.374 --> 15:58.834
I'll be down the hall
if you need anything.

16:21.816 --> 16:23.192
What are you doing to me?

16:26.737 --> 16:28.239
Go ahead.

16:28.781 --> 16:30.491
Take a look inside.

16:37.498 --> 16:39.834
I'm delighted
you like my little trick.

16:40.501 --> 16:42.044
Magic is for babies.

16:44.296 --> 16:46.006
Tough customer.

16:47.466 --> 16:48.676
Well, then...

16:59.812 --> 17:01.522
It tastes like sugar.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.192
Hey, where did it go?

17:05.317 --> 17:07.987
Would you like to learn
how to make it snow?

17:08.654 --> 17:11.531
I can teach you how to do that
once we get to Christmasland.

17:12.491 --> 17:15.327
I can teach you that
and so much more.

17:16.369 --> 17:20.875
But first I need to know the name
of the girl with the bridge.

17:22.126 --> 17:23.877
And no lying.

17:24.587 --> 17:26.505
I don't like liars.

17:27.757 --> 17:31.010
What do you say, Haley Smith?

17:41.729 --> 17:43.230
I want my mom.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.297
Hey. Hey, where the hell are you?

18:08.422 --> 18:11.091
Miss Howard said
you hadn't been to work in two days.

18:11.884 --> 18:14.553
I'm in Haverhill, Massachusetts.

18:18.516 --> 18:21.310
Sir, you don't shush me.
You don't ever shush me.

18:21.435 --> 18:24.230
I'm a librarian. I shush you.

18:25.356 --> 18:26.565
Sorry.

18:28.776 --> 18:31.654
I got a hot tip from my Scrabble bag
that the Wraith would be here.

18:31.779 --> 18:33.364
I told you to stay off the case.

18:33.489 --> 18:36.534
He took another kid, Joe. I need you
to put an amber alert on the car.

18:36.659 --> 18:40.037
No, I cannot put out an amber alert
for another state. I can't do that.

18:40.162 --> 18:42.623
- Then put out a national one.
- No, Maggie, no.

18:42.748 --> 18:45.125
I did my research, okay?
It'll cost you nothing.

18:45.251 --> 18:48.629
An amber alert can cause panic and
chaos. And then if you're wrong...

18:48.754 --> 18:49.880
But I'm not wrong, okay?

18:49.964 --> 18:52.508
I was right about Mrs. Richardson.
I'm right about this.

18:52.633 --> 18:54.301
Mrs. Richardson again, really?

18:54.426 --> 18:56.637
I know you're worried, but Joe...

18:57.680 --> 19:00.933
I am a thousand percent sure.

19:18.868 --> 19:22.121
Hey, Miss McQueen.
Vic's not answering her phone.

19:22.246 --> 19:24.248
Chris said she might be here, so...

19:24.748 --> 19:26.083
Well, she's not feeling well.

19:27.501 --> 19:28.878
Will you tell her I stopped by?

19:30.087 --> 19:33.173
I like you, Craig, I do.
I feel for your situation.

19:33.257 --> 19:36.844
Your mom and her troubles. Chris and
me always tried to do what we could.

19:36.969 --> 19:37.803
I know. Thank you.

19:37.928 --> 19:39.722
But I have worked too damn hard

19:39.847 --> 19:42.766
to make sure my Vicky
doesn't make those kind of choices.

19:44.143 --> 19:46.437
She came home with red eyes.

19:47.771 --> 19:50.858
Pretty sure you guys aren't just
riding bikes out in those woods.

19:51.483 --> 19:54.612
You think Vic's smoking weed?
She wouldn't do that.

19:54.737 --> 19:56.864
I am asking you
to keep away from her.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.617
You don't know anything about her.

20:00.868 --> 20:02.328
Give your mom my best.

20:09.084 --> 20:13.422
Damn it. It's the dirtbike
and she's constantly sick.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.090
No.

20:16.050 --> 20:19.511
No, no...
I'm not saying that.

20:20.095 --> 20:23.766
Chris, I'm saying that we haven't
been the best example.

20:25.559 --> 20:29.355
Well, you know, for whatever reason
she won't listen to me, okay?

20:29.480 --> 20:30.648
She chose you.

20:31.941 --> 20:35.569
I am just... I am just asking you
to try and get through to her.

21:00.344 --> 21:02.012
When was the first time?

21:02.596 --> 21:03.764
What?

21:06.100 --> 21:07.726
You know, that...

21:08.852 --> 21:10.020
that he hit you?

21:20.614 --> 21:22.449
I don't know exactly.

21:24.660 --> 21:27.287
We were so young
when we met, and...

21:28.414 --> 21:29.623
wild.

21:30.833 --> 21:32.418
I can't imagine you being wild.

21:32.543 --> 21:34.128
Well, I was. We were.

21:34.253 --> 21:37.339
Especially after he got back
from the Gulf.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.135
We liked to get drunk.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.014
When we were drunk we'd fight...

21:46.098 --> 21:48.851
and sometimes
I'd wake up with a fat lip.

21:51.687 --> 21:53.063
So why did you stay?

21:53.689 --> 21:55.774
Because it wasn't all the time.

21:59.486 --> 22:00.863
Because...

22:02.448 --> 22:05.284
Because sometimes
I'm the one that started it.

22:07.703 --> 22:13.042
And because he promised me he'd lay
off the hard stuff, I believed him.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.546
Then suddenly over the years
we had you...

22:17.671 --> 22:21.175
and my life with him had been longer

22:21.300 --> 22:23.177
than my life without him.

22:25.888 --> 22:27.347
So I stayed.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.436
And I tried to keep believing
that he'd change.

22:40.277 --> 22:42.071
How long have you known?

22:44.323 --> 22:45.824
Not that long.

22:52.790 --> 22:55.584
I guess though, looking back
I always had a feeling.

22:58.962 --> 23:00.798
But I tucked it away like a secret

23:00.923 --> 23:03.634
because I needed to believe
that Dad was good.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.137
He is, honey.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.141
And he's not.

23:16.939 --> 23:20.359
People can be both. The trouble is,
you only ever see the good.

23:22.945 --> 23:24.696
I've got to get to work.

23:24.822 --> 23:27.199
There's a bag over here
with your name on it.

23:27.783 --> 23:30.202
A few things I figured you'd want
over at Tiffany's.

23:31.662 --> 23:33.789
- Mom, thank you.
- Yeah.

23:33.914 --> 23:35.541
Lock up when you leave.

24:23.172 --> 24:24.590
How are you feeling?

24:25.757 --> 24:27.092
I want my mom.

24:27.217 --> 24:30.470
You know, Haley,
you and I are a lot alike.

24:30.596 --> 24:32.097
But we aren't.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.768
My mother, Fanny Manx,

24:37.769 --> 24:40.606
was very much like your Sharon.

24:41.190 --> 24:43.734
She banished me to the outdoors,

24:44.526 --> 24:48.113
so she could indulge
in selfish pleasures.

24:50.490 --> 24:53.076
We lived in a mining town.
There weren't many children.

24:53.202 --> 24:55.454
The ones who were there
thought I was odd.

24:56.121 --> 24:59.291
Living in the back of a mortuary
and all...

25:00.334 --> 25:03.879
So from breakfast until sundown,

25:04.004 --> 25:06.423
I played all by myself.

25:08.008 --> 25:09.968
Sledding in my Phantom,

25:10.719 --> 25:12.262
building snowmen...

25:14.056 --> 25:15.474
It was lonely.

25:16.433 --> 25:19.102
You understand that, Haley,
don't you?

25:20.395 --> 25:24.107
To have a dark hole
at the center of your heart

25:24.733 --> 25:27.027
that only a friend can fill.

25:27.152 --> 25:28.445
I have friends.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.866
Yes, I almost forgot.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.036
The girl with the bridge.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.872
She's your only friend, isn't she?

25:40.791 --> 25:44.127
In my humble opinion this person
doesn't seem like a very good friend.

25:44.211 --> 25:47.089
She knew the sort of home life
you had and she never once offered

25:47.214 --> 25:49.508
to take you away
on a magic bridge, did she?

25:50.968 --> 25:54.471
I, on the other hand,
knew from the minute I met you...

25:55.097 --> 25:56.598
that you deserved better.

25:57.683 --> 26:00.602
That's why I'm taking you
to my special place.

26:01.687 --> 26:03.689
A place where there are children

26:03.814 --> 26:07.109
who want nothing more
than to be your friends.

26:07.776 --> 26:09.695
A place where there are no secrets.

26:12.030 --> 26:14.032
Where everyone shares...

26:14.866 --> 26:17.786
and you will always be loved.

26:19.037 --> 26:21.540
Mean it? Always?

26:24.251 --> 26:25.669
Just one catch.

26:26.503 --> 26:29.881
Little girls who keep secrets
can't go to Christmasland.

26:35.804 --> 26:38.640
Her name is Vic. Vic McQueen.

26:40.309 --> 26:43.020
Vic McQueen...

26:51.528 --> 26:53.322
Forgive the detour, darling.

26:53.447 --> 26:57.117
We have a stop to make
before Christmasland.

27:17.554 --> 27:18.597
Vic.

27:19.056 --> 27:20.766
You lost again?

27:21.475 --> 27:23.101
No. I'm here to return this.

27:24.519 --> 27:26.104
Can I come in?

27:27.356 --> 27:28.648
Wait...

27:36.656 --> 27:38.617
Yeah. I'm...

27:39.910 --> 27:41.745
I wasn't expecting anyone.

27:42.412 --> 27:44.581
It's just me.
Don't worry about it.

27:44.706 --> 27:47.376
Okay. Well, thanks.

27:49.086 --> 27:50.670
How did your job go?

27:52.881 --> 27:54.925
- Good.
- Yeah?

27:55.050 --> 27:56.593
It went... It went good.

27:57.302 --> 27:59.346
But... What is it, the job?

27:59.471 --> 28:00.847
Working security.

28:01.431 --> 28:04.142
Security? Cool.

28:07.104 --> 28:08.063
Who is your boss?

28:08.688 --> 28:10.899
Nice guy.
He's a nice guy.

28:11.691 --> 28:12.734
Just a guy.

28:15.570 --> 28:18.448
Well, yeah,
thanks for the comic.

28:19.533 --> 28:21.243
Bing, you and I are friends, right?

28:21.368 --> 28:23.370
Yeah. Friends to the end.

28:26.456 --> 28:30.460
So there's a rumor going around
that you're involved in something.

28:31.211 --> 28:32.462
Something bad.

28:32.587 --> 28:35.257
If anything's wrong, Bing,
you can tell me.

28:35.841 --> 28:37.217
Bing.

28:40.595 --> 28:43.348
I'm a good person.
You know I'm a good person.

28:43.473 --> 28:47.060
Yeah, of course. I just wanted
to make sure you're okay.

28:47.185 --> 28:48.728
Yeah, I'm fine.

28:48.854 --> 28:51.940
Fine, fine, fine...
Fine like a glass of red wine.

28:53.567 --> 28:54.734
I think you should leave.

28:56.278 --> 28:59.364
But... actually you still have
a couple of my comics.

28:59.489 --> 29:01.408
Can I get those back, first?

29:02.159 --> 29:04.077
I'll go... I'll go get them.

29:04.202 --> 29:05.412
Thank you.

29:08.331 --> 29:10.417
- Then you should go.
- Yeah.

29:37.486 --> 29:38.528
Haley?

29:46.661 --> 29:47.829
Haley?

29:51.666 --> 29:55.045
Those who sneak
and those who spy

29:55.170 --> 29:57.506
get punished when they try to lie.

29:58.590 --> 29:59.925
Where's Haley, Bing?

30:00.592 --> 30:02.677
- I never touched her.
- I don't believe you.

30:02.802 --> 30:03.970
- Shut up.
- Who has her?

30:04.054 --> 30:05.347
You shut up!

30:25.116 --> 30:25.951
Hello.

30:27.452 --> 30:28.870
It is.

30:32.040 --> 30:34.251
She's standing right here.

30:34.376 --> 30:36.920
No, I... I didn't touch her.

30:39.256 --> 30:40.382
Sure.

30:44.094 --> 30:45.804
He wants to talk to you.

31:04.614 --> 31:05.448
Hello?

31:06.199 --> 31:08.410
Hello, Vic McQueen.

31:08.952 --> 31:10.829
I've been looking for you.

31:12.330 --> 31:16.960
I believe you have an inscape
known as the Shorter Way Bridge.

31:17.627 --> 31:19.879
You're the one who took Haley?
You're the Wraith?

31:20.005 --> 31:23.174
The name, my dear,
is Charlie Manx.

31:25.969 --> 31:27.554
What have you done with her?

31:27.679 --> 31:29.014
Don't fret.

31:29.764 --> 31:33.518
Your little friend is on her way to
somewhere wonderful. She's sleeping.

31:33.643 --> 31:36.313
Now let's discuss
this little bridge of yours.

31:36.396 --> 31:38.898
- I want to talk with her.
- I think I should talk to Mr...

31:38.982 --> 31:41.985
If you want to talk about my bridge,
you let me speak to Haley first.

31:43.612 --> 31:46.489
I have a better idea.
Let's you and I meet.

31:46.615 --> 31:47.907
In person.

31:48.908 --> 31:50.827
Where and when? I'll be there.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.455
Splendid.

31:54.706 --> 31:55.999
I'll be in touch.

32:03.006 --> 32:04.299
Hello?

32:05.133 --> 32:07.469
Hello? Sir?

32:29.908 --> 32:34.245
The girl is better off with Mr Manx
than the mother.

32:37.415 --> 32:38.750
What do you mean?

32:40.126 --> 32:42.128
The mother was...

32:43.463 --> 32:44.798
dirty.

32:47.092 --> 32:49.427
- Sharon?
- Yeah.

32:50.804 --> 32:52.222
What did you do to her, Bing?

32:53.098 --> 32:54.766
I helped her.

32:55.642 --> 32:57.310
I made her clean.

32:58.311 --> 32:59.979
You tell me where she is.

33:00.563 --> 33:02.107
Bing, you tell me where she is!

33:02.857 --> 33:04.567
I can't.

33:05.819 --> 33:07.153
Oh, God.

33:12.784 --> 33:15.995
Bing... You thing...

33:17.038 --> 33:18.540
What have you done?

33:24.921 --> 33:27.716
Bing... You thing...

33:28.883 --> 33:30.260
What have you done?

33:31.511 --> 33:33.722
Everything is going to be alright.

33:53.616 --> 33:54.868
Bing, no.

33:55.994 --> 33:57.871
Bing, no! Bing!

33:58.747 --> 34:00.165
Stop.

34:00.999 --> 34:02.250
Stop, Bing!

35:24.999 --> 35:26.209
No!

35:48.940 --> 35:52.902
Sorry, man, my manager's gonna kill
me if he sees this monitor's broken.

35:56.239 --> 35:57.740
I like pine.

36:24.142 --> 36:26.519
It's okay, sweetheart.
I'm here to help.

36:26.644 --> 36:27.770
You're safe now.

36:31.649 --> 36:32.650
Right.

36:33.192 --> 36:36.237
Your total's going to be $44.32.

36:53.296 --> 36:56.841
68 cents is your change.

36:58.635 --> 37:01.220
Thanks. Here you go.

38:00.071 --> 38:03.658
Just this morning, a close family
friend gave a passionate plea

38:03.741 --> 38:05.118
for their safe return.

38:05.660 --> 38:08.079
Investigators
and forensic specialists

38:08.162 --> 38:10.456
exhumed the body
and will do an autopsy

38:10.540 --> 38:12.417
to determine
time and cause of death.

38:54.500 --> 38:57.086
...that the shallow grave
in the field behind me

38:57.170 --> 38:59.213
is in fact that of Sharon Smith,

38:59.338 --> 39:00.882
the mother of Haley Smith,

39:01.007 --> 39:02.717
who has also been reported missing.

39:03.426 --> 39:06.262
Friends and family have had
their worst fears realized...

40:21.087 --> 40:23.339
- You holding up okay?
- Yeah.

40:24.757 --> 40:25.883
Yep.

40:27.343 --> 40:30.096
Your mom's worried about you.
She thinks maybe you should...

40:30.221 --> 40:32.098
You need to go see a doctor.

40:32.849 --> 40:34.267
Do you?

40:34.392 --> 40:35.852
No, I'm fine.

40:43.359 --> 40:46.320
You know, if I could
make all this go away, I would.

40:49.157 --> 40:52.201
I was thinking, this weekend, that
maybe you and I could take a ride.

40:52.326 --> 40:55.538
Up to that bike shop in Plaistow.
You know that fancy-schmancy one?

40:57.832 --> 40:59.292
Maybe get...

41:00.168 --> 41:01.377
a little lunch after.

41:01.502 --> 41:04.422
At that diner
with the frappes you like.

41:05.673 --> 41:06.966
Yeah, sounds good.

41:07.091 --> 41:08.009
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:08.134 --> 41:09.343
Alright.

41:18.769 --> 41:22.064
You know, the cops,
they'll find Haley, you know?

41:23.524 --> 41:25.318
They'll catch whoever did this.

41:27.236 --> 41:28.905
No, they won't.

41:30.114 --> 41:31.908
They can't protect anyone.

41:34.160 --> 41:36.662
You're safe here, Brat. Alright?

41:38.497 --> 41:40.499
You're safe, I promise you.

41:42.585 --> 41:43.711
Yeah.

41:45.713 --> 41:47.173
Hey.

41:49.050 --> 41:50.259
Yeah.

41:54.722 --> 41:56.849
Just try to get some rest, okay?

41:59.060 --> 42:01.020
I love you like a big dog.

42:04.732 --> 42:06.067
Love you too.

42:08.027 --> 42:09.278
Alright.

43:25.396 --> 43:27.732
I've never seen so many lights.

43:28.274 --> 43:30.484
Just wait till you get inside.

43:31.193 --> 43:32.695
You're not coming?

43:32.820 --> 43:35.406
Alas, I must bid you adieu.

43:37.074 --> 43:38.701
But have no fear, my child,

43:38.826 --> 43:42.330
you have plenty of friends
in Christmasland.

43:59.638 --> 44:01.724
We've been waiting for you.

44:08.981 --> 44:10.983
They're for Scissors for the Drifter.

44:11.108 --> 44:12.777
It's a really fun game.

44:12.902 --> 44:14.737
I don't know how to play.

44:15.446 --> 44:17.740
It's easy.
We'll show you how.
