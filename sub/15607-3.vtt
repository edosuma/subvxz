that done for her, then?

16:31.420 --> 16:32.330
No, not at all.

16:32.331 --> 16:36.599
Point in fact, she
ain't been bled at all.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.519
Can you account for the
blood that covered her?

16:38.520 --> 16:40.079
I cannot.

16:40.080 --> 16:43.379
The sole wound on her is
the exact same puncturing

16:43.380 --> 16:44.949
of the neck with
the same instrument,

16:44.950 --> 16:46.389
but it's not been
used to drain her.

16:46.390 --> 16:51.869
On the contrary, she's,
uh-- well, complete.

16:51.870 --> 16:56.179

is not the end that is germain--

16:56.180 --> 16:57.419
not the end, but the means.

wound, is it not?

17:01.220 --> 17:03.069
It is precise.

17:03.070 --> 17:04.348
One might even say skilled.

17:04.349 --> 17:06.059
And whether it is
drained or not,

17:06.060 --> 17:10.169
it is the blood that is
a chief interest here.

17:10.170 --> 17:11.420

blood when it decays, Captain?

30:13.250 --> 30:15.819
The cadavers that are
sent to you from Newgate.

30:15.820 --> 30:17.469
A valuable resource, certainly.

30:17.470 --> 30:19.649
You have records from them?

30:19.650 --> 30:20.650
Of course.

30:25.130 --> 30:27.279
My thanks.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.079
Yesterday, you say?

30:29.080 --> 30:33.069
Yes, the name
Monks, as I heard it.

30:33.070 --> 30:35.100
No.
As you see, no such name.

30:41.110 --> 30:42.519
No, indeed.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.269
A wasted visit then.

30:44.270 --> 30:46.279
Oh, never that, Mr. Reid.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.559
Mr. Treves, tell me.

30:47.560 --> 30:51.299
The cadaver's whose origin I
seek-- we have him currently.

30:51.300 --> 30:54.889
He was found perhaps one day
after his Newgate execution.

30:54.890 --> 30:57.099
His neck punctured.

30:57.100 --> 30:59.029
His body inverted.

30:59.030 --> 31:00.280
And it entirely exsanguinated.

31:04.270 --> 31:07.319
Now were it a means
rather than an ends?

31:07.320 --> 31:08.459
I know it is not orthodox.

31:08.460 --> 31:09.639
See, I understand that.

31:09.640 --> 31:12.719
But-- but the fringes of
medical practise, to take

31:12.720 --> 31:14.109
blood and then preserve it.

31:14.110 --> 31:18.189
What purpose can you
imagine for such an action?

31:18.190 --> 31:20.399
Knowledge.

31:20.400 --> 31:23.169
To know.

31:23.170 --> 31:24.080
Blood is life.

31:24.081 --> 31:30.530
How might that life be
taken, preserved, handed on?

31:34.790 --> 31:35.790
Mr. Treves.

31:42.370 --> 31:45.569
I always recommend a smoke
when you're two pints down.

31:45.570 --> 31:48.529
Never known a head rush like it.

31:48.530 --> 31:51.039
Ah, Inspectors.

31:51.040 --> 31:55.659
You've come for some answers,
and now I have a few.

31:55.660 --> 31:57.749
Your, uh-- your lady there--

31:57.750 --> 31:59.509
Her name was Agnieszka.

31:59.510 --> 32:00.430
Ah.

32:00.431 --> 32:02.489
Well, now I know her name.

32:02.490 --> 32:05.099
And what killed her.

32:05.100 --> 32:06.429
And so?

32:06.430 --> 32:08.629
It was organ collapse.

32:08.630 --> 32:13.489
Almost total internal collapse--
heart, kidneys, bladder, liver.

32:13.490 --> 32:20.339
And the cause of that failure
was a corruption in her blood.

32:20.340 --> 32:22.189
Come see.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.299
Now you know where the
haemoglobin is, Reid,

32:24.300 --> 32:25.200
I assume that?

32:25.201 --> 32:27.799
It is a compound which carries
oxygen through the blood

32:27.800 --> 32:28.580
to the organs.

32:28.581 --> 32:29.989
Ever eager student, this one.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.782
Now this is Agnieszka's blood.
Take a look.

32:42.770 --> 32:44.969
Her blood ain't carrying
nothing no where.

32:44.970 --> 32:46.299
That's the organ failure?

32:46.300 --> 32:49.289
Now--

32:49.290 --> 32:51.409
Have you bled the
whole division?

32:51.410 --> 32:52.889
Save you two, almost.

32:52.890 --> 32:54.670
Now I take two
different samples.

33:05.430 --> 33:06.630
Reid, make a comparison.

33:11.820 --> 33:12.959
It is clotting.

33:12.960 --> 33:18.249
The men's blood
meet and corrupt.

33:18.250 --> 33:21.549
We say then that the blood
that covered her as she

33:21.550 --> 33:23.289
ran-- it was not hers.

33:23.290 --> 33:26.799
But his-- piped from him
into her through the puncture

33:26.800 --> 33:27.500
in her neck.

33:27.501 --> 33:30.899
Only she feels her body rebel,
the panic of it, and runs.

33:30.900 --> 33:32.409
But why?

33:32.410 --> 33:33.479
Why do this?

33:33.480 --> 33:36.419
The care taken-- it cannot be
for cruelty, for death alone.

33:36.420 --> 33:39.489
Even a vampire inflicts
death so that he may live.

33:39.490 --> 33:43.219
But what if two men's blood
does not always corrupt?

33:43.220 --> 33:45.219
Now what if my blood
is somehow different

33:45.220 --> 33:47.869
from yours but akin to Drake's?

33:47.870 --> 33:49.089
As if I don't have
troubles enough.

33:49.090 --> 33:50.609
Thatcher here, for example.

33:50.610 --> 33:55.249
Now I mixed his blood with, uh,
your hanging man there, Monk's.

33:55.250 --> 33:56.250
Take a look.

34:00.430 --> 34:01.430
It prospers.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.609
Thatcher.

34:07.610 --> 34:12.248
Thatcher, you-- you
are a match for him.

34:12.250 --> 34:15.289
So together they make life.

34:15.290 --> 34:19.958
This earlier lancing you
identified, Captain--

34:19.960 --> 34:21.599
The puncture wound infected.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.139
Could this be
the means by which

34:23.139 --> 34:24.609
a-- a sampling took place?

34:24.610 --> 34:28.309
And the pre-selecting of
a correlating blood match.

34:28.310 --> 34:31.668
Inspector Drake, the, uh-- the
wound [INAUDIBLE] on the girl

34:31.670 --> 34:34.739
is the same infection, do we--
do we say perhaps that meant

34:34.739 --> 34:35.739
[INAUDIBLE] was a match?

34:39.190 --> 34:46.580
And not Agnieszka who has
no such infected wounds.

34:50.100 --> 34:51.918
Did she go in Magdalena's
stead therefore?

34:51.920 --> 34:53.649
Her blood, no match.

34:53.650 --> 34:56.480
It corrupted, and her
death brought down.

34:59.300 --> 35:02.379
And this man, Monks,
here-- his sampling

35:02.380 --> 35:04.739
could only have happened before
his execution for the blood

35:04.740 --> 35:05.740
to be alive.

35:13.630 --> 35:16.919
Mr. Drummond, run
a records search.

35:16.920 --> 35:19.559
Magdalena Dobrowski, 23.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.169
I expect you'll find
she spent some time

35:21.170 --> 35:24.389
behind the walls of Newgate.

35:24.390 --> 35:27.449
It is curious, this, Captain.

35:27.450 --> 35:31.109
But Mr. Treves's records show
no transfer of this man's

35:31.110 --> 35:32.810
cadaver from Newgate to London.

35:36.510 --> 35:40.379
Do we must assume your
source corrupted, also?

35:40.380 --> 35:41.870
[RINGING]

35:43.420 --> 35:44.420
Drummond!

35:46.920 --> 35:47.989
Yes.

35:47.990 --> 35:48.730
Thank you.

35:48.731 --> 35:51.749
Four months for
the theft of bread.

35:51.750 --> 35:52.560
You find that girl.

35:52.561 --> 35:53.599
You bring her back.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.809
I imagine we are to
Newgate, Inspector.

35:55.810 --> 35:57.289
Quite so, Mr. Reid.

35:57.290 --> 36:00.429
Oh, Jackson, best you come, too.

36:00.430 --> 36:02.230
Introduce us to that
source of yours.

36:11.410 --> 36:14.429
You lied to me, Probyn.

36:14.430 --> 36:18.319
Who did you pass Percival
Monks' cadaver to, sir?

36:18.320 --> 36:20.769
Uh, the disposal
of prison remains

36:20.770 --> 36:24.059
is very far from my
responsibility, Inspector.

36:24.060 --> 36:26.459
The London hospital
is where such cadavers

36:26.460 --> 36:28.969
are, under normal
circumstances, sent.

36:28.970 --> 36:31.359
If one has gone astray,
then it has not done

36:31.360 --> 36:32.669
so from within my agreement.

36:32.670 --> 36:34.420
Where is it you keep
your needles, Doctor?

36:37.630 --> 36:39.050
You have the key about you?

37:03.680 --> 37:06.659
Instrument's much used, sir.

37:06.660 --> 37:07.969
Blunted, in fact.

37:07.970 --> 37:11.669
I am provided with but a
modest stipend, Mr. Reid.

37:11.670 --> 37:14.119
I'm sure.

37:14.120 --> 37:17.779
Mr. Monks had a needle
fester wound on his arm,

37:17.780 --> 37:19.289
here, in the crook of his elbow.

37:19.290 --> 37:22.320
A Polish woman, Magdalena
Dobrowski, likewise, Doctor.

37:49.350 --> 37:50.809
No, sir.

No, I-- I will not
be so suspected.

When Agnieszka was
killed, Dr. Carlyle Probyn

was enjoying supper with the
Newgate board of trustees.

did not have him

You know, Probyn.

44:22.820 --> 44:25.459
I think me and you may yet
escape this particular pickle

44:25.460 --> 44:26.460
in one piece.

44:29.730 --> 44:33.079
I never had a
daughter, you know.

44:33.080 --> 44:35.459
I should have
liked one, however.

44:35.460 --> 44:38.759
What benefit do you imagine
she might have carried?

44:38.760 --> 44:40.609
Well.

44:40.610 --> 44:42.930
No ship's head was ever made
from the figure of a man.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.730
[LAUGHTER]

44:49.210 --> 44:53.339
She would have been pleasing
to have about the place is all.

44:53.340 --> 44:55.779
Kind words, a pot of coffee.

44:55.780 --> 44:57.549
Sons do not offer such?

44:57.550 --> 44:59.029
They do not.

44:59.030 --> 45:00.580
They're altogether
a more bother.

45:04.280 --> 45:05.690
- Huh.
- The man, Nathaniel.

45:08.260 --> 45:08.960
He's yours?

45:08.961 --> 45:11.770
My responsibility, I
feel, if not my blood.

45:14.980 --> 45:16.449
You?

45:16.450 --> 45:17.450
You have a child?

45:21.050 --> 45:22.799
I do not believe you
would allow me to rest

45:22.800 --> 45:25.059
here ignorant of who I am.

45:25.060 --> 45:26.389
[LAUGHS]

45:26.390 --> 45:29.129
Or my monstrous crimes.

45:29.130 --> 45:30.390
Certainly that is true.

45:35.130 --> 45:37.969
They do not trouble you?

45:37.970 --> 45:40.170
The crimes?
Should they?

45:44.320 --> 45:51.339
There is-- one blacker.

45:51.340 --> 45:55.320
It felt blacker, I
mean, in my heart.

45:58.270 --> 46:01.069
Oh, believe me, child.

46:01.070 --> 46:03.730
Many is a fellow to have
lost his life on my account.

46:10.380 --> 46:13.919
You'll be calm in this school.

46:13.920 --> 46:18.919
Mine is not a place of
judgment or justice.

46:18.920 --> 46:21.690
I leave some refined
notions to others.

46:26.670 --> 46:28.749
Scotland Yard, British
Medical Association, the French

46:28.750 --> 46:30.259
Confederation, [INAUDIBLE].

46:30.260 --> 46:34.879
All that have been barred in
the last three years, say.

46:34.880 --> 46:36.599
Suggestion for the
cause of such barring

46:36.600 --> 46:37.699
is illegal
transfusion of bloods.

46:37.700 --> 46:39.369
Yes, Mr. Reid.

46:39.370 --> 46:41.129
Do no harm.

46:41.130 --> 46:44.279
It's the first and most abiding
maxim by which you practise by.

46:44.280 --> 46:47.029
And yet you have
done plenty, Captain.

46:47.030 --> 46:47.910
I've seen it.

46:47.911 --> 46:50.329
Only when sorely pressed
and never to a soul

46:50.330 --> 46:51.899
that didn't have it coming.

46:51.900 --> 46:54.509
You had a moral imperative.

46:54.510 --> 46:57.479
You want to call
it that, I did.

46:57.480 --> 46:58.919
This man, likewise.

46:58.920 --> 47:00.749
A child-- his child.

47:00.750 --> 47:04.709
No sin too great to
save her, I imagine.

47:04.710 --> 47:06.730
Perhaps you know
how he feels, Reid.

47:12.460 --> 47:15.080
Drum, I'm sure I saw a
bottle back here somewhere.

47:44.110 --> 47:46.419
You hope to get a little
reading, are you, Sergeant?

47:46.420 --> 47:47.579
Uh, no.

47:47.580 --> 47:49.749
Uh, I mean, well, yes.

47:49.750 --> 47:52.059
A bit of-- quiet moment.

47:52.060 --> 47:54.759
"Dracula."

47:54.760 --> 47:58.509
The evil Transylvanian Count.

47:58.510 --> 48:00.359
Because all foreigners
are dangerous

48:00.360 --> 48:04.350

cannibalism of our young women.

48:10.550 --> 48:15.099
I shall see this returned
then, shall I, Sergeant?

48:15.100 --> 48:21.229
Yes, I would-- um, uh,
uh, kind folk, Inspector.

48:22.680 --> 48:24.619

48:24.620 --> 48:25.829
It is, sir.

48:25.830 --> 48:26.680
French Police.

48:26.681 --> 48:27.949
There is a pursued felon, sir.

48:27.950 --> 48:29.119
Thus the urgency
of their response.

48:29.120 --> 48:30.649
And his crime?

48:30.650 --> 48:36.329
DRUM: His wife found bled
out in their Paris home

48:36.330 --> 48:38.649
and neither he nor their
daughter seen since.

48:38.650 --> 48:40.559
And his name, Drummond.

48:45.490 --> 48:46.430
His wife?

48:46.431 --> 48:48.549
Why would he perform the
same experiment on his wife?

48:48.550 --> 48:50.669
Perhaps she was sick, also.

48:50.670 --> 48:51.859
With the same disease.

48:51.860 --> 48:53.959
An inherited disease of
the blood-- haemophilia.

48:53.960 --> 48:55.939
Ah, that-- that can
be bad, but it can be

48:55.940 --> 48:57.299

anaemia, photosensitivity.

49:08.140 --> 49:10.399

49:10.400 --> 49:13.009
One might consider it a moral
imperative to seek to spare

49:13.010 --> 49:16.219
a child from such suffering.

49:16.220 --> 49:18.009
Thatcher!

49:18.010 --> 49:19.589
How's your French, Sergeant?

49:19.590 --> 49:21.229
Uh, worse than my Polish, sir.

49:21.230 --> 49:22.509
Then simply shout louder.

49:22.510 --> 49:24.229
Get a [INAUDIBLE]
French Embassy.

49:24.230 --> 49:24.930
Wake them.

49:24.931 --> 49:26.299
Do not leave until
they have provided you

49:26.300 --> 49:28.299
with full, photographic
details of this man.

Blanchard.

49:40.610 --> 49:41.610
Miss Dobrowski.

49:43.860 --> 49:46.890
I'm relieved to finally
meet you in person.

49:50.710 --> 49:53.569
I did not mean to
deceive you, sir.

49:53.570 --> 49:54.480
Before, I mean.

49:54.481 --> 49:58.829
When you sent another
in your name, hm?

49:58.830 --> 50:01.740
She who is now gone.

50:04.360 --> 50:06.199
I made a sacrifice
for a greater need.

50:06.200 --> 50:08.479
The only mercy is that
it was a final trial.

50:08.480 --> 50:12.559
Else you would now also have the
sacrifice of my daughter's life

50:12.560 --> 50:13.560
on your conscience.

50:21.470 --> 50:23.959
Your life transformed, hm?

50:23.960 --> 50:27.730
In return for the
transformation of my Camille.

50:43.190 --> 50:44.760
But you are here now.

50:47.920 --> 50:50.129
[INAUDIBLE].

50:50.130 --> 50:53.659
This is because
they are French.

50:53.660 --> 50:56.519
But as Mr. Reid
suggested, I shouted.

50:56.520 --> 50:59.679
And they soon packed
up their moaning.

50:59.680 --> 51:01.999
No, he's also down
to their being French.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
May I, Inspector?

51:09.290 --> 51:11.989
This man.

51:11.990 --> 51:13.410
I have met this man.

We jump in, it goes bad.

out, they won't stop.

Let me talk to him, Drake.

Has the board of

of discredited medicine

on the other girl.

an opportunistic falsehood.

that when you struck this deal.

Then rest.

Even if this transfusion
is completed,

59:02.770 --> 59:06.049
The only father
he will ever know.

59:06.050 --> 59:07.490
[CRYING]

59:09.400 --> 59:10.839
No, no.

59:10.840 --> 59:11.840
I'll see to him.

59:15.300 --> 59:16.300
It's all right then.

59:18.880 --> 59:22.549
I'm here now.

59:22.550 --> 59:24.040
It's all right, [INAUDIBLE].

59:50.910 --> 59:53.759
- Is it that you do not like him?
- I barely know him.

59:53.760 --> 59:54.460
That is my point.

59:54.461 --> 59:58.179
Neither do you.

59:58.180 --> 59:59.759
And yet I like him.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.260
That-- that is a
guess, Mathilda.

01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:09.979
And so instead you would prefer
I created experiments to test

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:11.529
what [INAUDIBLE] is made of.

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:13.269
I might, yes.

01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:17.020
But do you not see
this is that experiment?

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.909
He appreciates it the way
he does not appreciate it.

01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:26.029
These things are guides for you.

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:28.919
Well, is that not fair?

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.880
Fair?

01:00:29.881 --> 01:00:32.959
I'm not sure, Mathilda.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.889
When these human
transactions were writ,

01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:38.599
fairness was not much
of a consideration.

01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:51.169
You make your test, Mathilda.

01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:54.600
But be sure to let me
know if he passes or not.

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:42.509
PROBYN: I, uh, served
for a time in Alexandria.

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:45.589
Ah, and grew fond
of the blend there.

01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:47.339
Quite so.

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:49.909
I was not, uh, misinformed then?

01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:52.089
You do have access
to the Egyptian

01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:54.529
brand of tobacco I favour?

01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:57.419
It has taken me an age
to hunt down a supply.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:58.420
[LAUGHS]

01:01:58.870 --> 01:02:01.239
Well, you may rest gentle, sir.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.309
That hunt is now behind you.

01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:04.689
Ah.

01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:06.059
Mister--

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.410
WOMAN: His name's Probyn.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:17.029
Not a tobacconist?

01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:18.889
No.

01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:20.460
He is a doctor.
The Newgate doctor.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.009
I am relieved of my
duties now, however.

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:28.689
How have you found me?

01:02:28.690 --> 01:02:30.279
How?

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.589
I am shocked you asked.

01:02:32.590 --> 01:02:35.159
That husband of yours
stalking back into my life

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.179
with his threats.

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:38.899
It is his colleague
has me reported

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.449
and deprived of my work.

01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:43.759
200 pounds.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.979
Otherwise, my own
further harm or know,

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:50.809
your secret will be told
and that wretch son of yours

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:54.279
will never see your
spiteful little face again.

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.819
Abel, I think, on
reflection, you should not.

01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:59.329
ABEL: For why?

01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:02.769
[INAUDIBLE] had his sack
of [INAUDIBLE] this one.

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:04.589
No threat [INAUDIBLE],
and I cannot

01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:07.269
believe he will be missed.

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:08.790
I shall tell you for why, Abel.

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:18.970
Between first and
second rib, is it not?

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.230
It is, my dear.

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.500
Oh.

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:42.130
[GASP]

01:03:44.110 --> 01:03:49.309
Nate, two ox and a
tarpaulin, if you please.

01:03:49.310 --> 01:03:51.210
Speak to me of
my son, would you?

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.340
Eh?
Yes, yes.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:00.500
Brandy.

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.509
There.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:08.989
Fit for a king.

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:12.600
Had the French not done away
with such things as kings.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:29.249
What am I, Abel?

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:31.250
Why, a princess.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.289
Oh, no.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:38.729
Why do you weep?

01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:40.219
Not for him, surely.

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.200
[CRYING]

01:04:41.201 --> 01:04:44.139
No.

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:47.079
The other.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.310
The dark secret I spoke of.

01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:50.070
Ah.

01:04:50.071 --> 01:04:52.570
The last definite
death by my hand.

01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:57.670
And who he?

01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:04.699
My father.

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:07.099
It was my father.

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.599
I killed my father.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.600
