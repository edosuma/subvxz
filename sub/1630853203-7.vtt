WEBVTT

00:07.094 --> 00:08.791
Previously on "61st Street"...

00:08.834 --> 00:10.053
Don't move!

00:10.097 --> 00:11.837
Fire!

00:11.881 --> 00:14.666
We found the bullet.They shot at
my boy.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.799
If I can help you
with anything, hit me up.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.322
So you her boyfriend
now?

00:18.366 --> 00:20.890
I heard you made a big thing
about Rufus Porter.

00:20.933 --> 00:22.892
He was a snitch.
Oh, my God.

00:22.935 --> 00:25.025
Rufus knew about
our deal with the Faction,

00:25.068 --> 00:26.504
so he had to go.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.028
I want to hear it.
Jessica...

00:28.071 --> 00:29.551
I want to hear it.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.770
You would be in the middle
of what he was doing.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.076
You haven't taken
one pill!

00:33.120 --> 00:34.469
The side effects...

00:34.512 --> 00:35.992
I've got to be strong.
I've got to be ready.

00:36.558 --> 00:40.910
The image you're about to see
is graphic and disturbing,

00:40.953 --> 00:42.868
but it's your duty
to look at it.

00:44.957 --> 00:48.222
Officer Michael Rossi died
a violent death,

00:48.265 --> 00:50.180
and this is the man
who killed him.

00:52.661 --> 00:58.623
Officer Rossi died because
he was doing his job that day.

00:58.667 --> 01:02.366
Guns and drugs were recovered
on the corner.

01:02.410 --> 01:05.065
Drugs were found
in the Johnson home.

01:05.108 --> 01:07.197
It's a home occupied
by three people --

01:07.241 --> 01:11.114
Moses, his mother, Norma,
and his younger brother, Joshua.

01:12.898 --> 01:15.423
A Nation gang member
fired his weapon

01:15.466 --> 01:17.251
during the corner drug bust.

01:17.294 --> 01:22.038
Moses' father is an
established leader of that gang.

01:22.082 --> 01:26.738
So, I guess you could say
Moses -- drug-dealing gangbanger

01:26.782 --> 01:28.697
from a family
of drug-dealing gangbangers --

01:28.740 --> 01:31.265
was doing his job
that day as well.No. No.

01:31.308 --> 01:32.831
Your Honor...Judge
Counselor?

01:32.875 --> 01:34.616
...there's no evidence
that Moses, his mother,

01:34.659 --> 01:37.140
or brother are drug dealers
or gang members.

01:37.184 --> 01:40.143
Ms. Motherwell here
is misleading the jury.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.231
No way.

01:41.275 --> 01:42.406
Get up here, both of you.

01:47.324 --> 01:49.152
What else were they doing
on that corner?

01:49.196 --> 01:50.414
You see?
There it is.

01:50.458 --> 01:51.807
I just can't let
an invitation

01:51.850 --> 01:53.330
to crazy prejudice go,
Your Honor.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.332
Are you suggesting
that my remarks are racist?

01:55.376 --> 01:56.942
I can't think
of another word.

01:56.986 --> 01:59.206
Jesus Christ.That's enough.

01:59.249 --> 02:02.383
Counselor, withdraw that comment
and apologize.

02:02.426 --> 02:04.428
I won't do it, Your Honor.
I'd be lying if I did.

02:04.472 --> 02:06.387
He ran from the scene.
Somehow, that's not evidence?

02:06.430 --> 02:07.953
That's me being racist?

02:07.997 --> 02:09.259
I mean, the drugs were found
under her mattress.

02:09.303 --> 02:11.174
And we all know
how they got there.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.524
Then you can cross examine
on that.

02:13.568 --> 02:15.178
Carry on,
Ms. Motherwell.

02:26.233 --> 02:29.061
This is a trial
about state of mind.

02:29.105 --> 02:32.891
What was Moses Johnson's
state of mind

02:32.935 --> 02:36.417
at the time he caused
the death of Michael Rossi?

02:36.460 --> 02:39.028
Look at his expression
in the photograph.

02:39.071 --> 02:42.727
Is there any better evidence
of what's in a man's mind

02:42.771 --> 02:44.425
than the look on his face?

02:44.468 --> 02:47.819
Seconds after that,
Michael Rossi was on the ground

02:47.863 --> 02:52.041
with a catastrophic head injury
that ended his life.

02:52.084 --> 02:53.651
It's simple.

02:53.695 --> 02:55.218
Just look at the picture.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.702
In the words of another lawyer
in another city

03:00.745 --> 03:05.794
not so long ago --
believe your own eyes.

03:16.239 --> 03:17.545
Yeah, you know what?
I'm gonna walk.

03:17.588 --> 03:19.068
What are you talking about?
No, no. Walk?

03:19.111 --> 03:21.070
Listen, the GPS says
this is gonna clear up, alright?

03:21.113 --> 03:22.550
It's gonna clear up.

03:31.298 --> 03:35.302
Do you know what it takes
to be this?

03:35.345 --> 03:40.307
00 A.M. wake-ups,
two-a-day workouts

03:40.350 --> 03:44.267
six days a week,
a minutely calibrated diet.

03:44.311 --> 03:47.139
How hard is that
in a food desert?

03:47.183 --> 03:49.316
Maintaining a 3.8 GPA,

03:49.359 --> 03:51.535
perfect attendance,
honors program.

03:51.579 --> 03:55.017
You know what it takes
to be that?

03:55.060 --> 03:59.282
It takes discipline, dedication,
and focus.

03:59.326 --> 04:01.763
The question I have for
all of you all today is that,

04:01.806 --> 04:06.768
while he's doing all of this
and all of that,

04:06.811 --> 04:09.771
where he does he find the time
to deal drugs and do gang shit?

04:09.814 --> 04:10.902
Counselor.

04:10.946 --> 04:12.295
I-I-I'm sorry,
Your Honor.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.905
I'm sorry.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.211
I'm sorry.

04:15.255 --> 04:19.171
See, I'd like to speak
my English,

04:19.215 --> 04:20.825
not the courtroom English
during this trial.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.305
See, I-I'm from
the South Side,

04:22.349 --> 04:24.438
and I want to speak
how we speak.

04:24.481 --> 04:25.917
This trial is about us,

04:25.961 --> 04:31.053
and I think the words
should be our words.

04:31.096 --> 04:33.969
Thank you.

04:34.012 --> 04:35.579
Let me tell you something.

04:35.623 --> 04:38.321
A full time corner boy, 17,
and never been busted?

04:38.365 --> 04:39.801
That's a first.

04:39.844 --> 04:42.064
And a gang member that spends
most of his time

04:42.107 --> 04:44.501
running around the track
instead of his corner?

04:44.545 --> 04:45.807
That's unique.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.112
So, I'mma go straight
to the part

04:47.156 --> 04:48.940
of your thinking
where Ms. Motherwell here

04:48.984 --> 04:50.551
just wants you
to limit yourself,

04:50.594 --> 04:51.769
and I'm gonna ask you
the question

04:51.813 --> 04:53.205
that she wants you to ask.

04:53.249 --> 04:57.427
If you ain't got nothing
to hide, why run?

04:57.471 --> 05:01.257
See, I think Ms. Motherwell here
just answered that question

05:01.301 --> 05:04.304
by making her assumption
and presumptions,

05:04.347 --> 05:07.655
assuming and presuming
you share them.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.396
Here we go.

05:09.439 --> 05:13.661
Black male on a corner in
proximity to other Black males

05:13.704 --> 05:17.317
equals drug dealer/gang
member/someone to be scared of.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.232
Never mind the fact
that he's 100 feet away

05:20.276 --> 05:22.365
from the house
he lived in his whole life.

05:22.409 --> 05:23.801
We're not looking at that.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.237
We're not seeing that.

05:25.281 --> 05:27.979
We're just seeing
his blackness.

05:28.023 --> 05:32.680
And when a young Black man
is seen through a white lens,

05:32.723 --> 05:36.292
lazy prejudice provides a story
about who he is

05:36.336 --> 05:37.859
and what he's doing.

05:37.902 --> 05:43.952
See, but what I want to do
is step away from lazy...

05:46.563 --> 05:49.087
...and think better.

05:49.131 --> 05:51.525
Moses feared for his life,
and so he ran.

05:51.568 --> 05:52.917
Was he right to fear
for his life?

05:52.961 --> 05:54.354
We say yes.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.704
Was he right to resist?

05:56.747 --> 05:58.053
Hmm.

05:58.096 --> 05:59.446
Let's ask somebody.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.404
Let's ask Laquan McDonald.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.275
Let's ask Philando Castile.

06:03.319 --> 06:05.365
Let's ask Michael Brown,
Tamir Rice.

06:05.408 --> 06:08.019
Let's ask George Floyd.

06:08.063 --> 06:10.718
Oh. Wait.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.763
We can't.

06:12.807 --> 06:15.636
They're dead.

06:15.679 --> 06:19.074
Was Moses Johnson right to do
everything he could to make sure

06:19.117 --> 06:21.903
that his name did not end up
on that long list of young

06:21.946 --> 06:24.471
Black men and women
that were killed by police?

06:24.514 --> 06:29.389
We say yes.
We say it was his self-defense.

06:29.432 --> 06:31.129
Now, Ms. Motherwell wants you

06:31.173 --> 06:35.307
to look at one frozen moment
in time,

06:35.351 --> 06:38.528
out of context, and draw
from it conclusions about

06:38.572 --> 06:44.055
what Moses Johnson was thinking
and feeling in this moment.

06:44.099 --> 06:46.536
She wants you to narrow
your thinking.

06:46.580 --> 06:50.888
In fact, she doesn't want you
to think much at all.

06:50.932 --> 06:54.326
We want you to go wide and
understand what was in his mind

06:54.370 --> 06:58.940
by seeing the world
from hispoint of view,

06:58.983 --> 07:01.159
not your own.

07:01.203 --> 07:03.466
Is that expression
on his face --

07:03.510 --> 07:08.515
is that anger, or is it fear?

07:08.558 --> 07:10.473
Is that violence in his eyes?

07:15.826 --> 07:19.177
Or is it terror?

07:19.221 --> 07:22.790
She wants you to look athim.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.835
I want you to imagine
beinghim.

07:24.879 --> 07:28.448
That's the difference
between the two of us.

07:28.491 --> 07:31.755
What I'm asking you to do
is exercise your imagination

07:31.799 --> 07:35.629
in place of your prejudice.

07:35.672 --> 07:39.328
Now, I-I-I'm a little nervous

07:39.371 --> 07:41.330
and a little scared,

07:41.373 --> 07:44.333
because, as divided
as this country is

07:44.376 --> 07:49.164
and as tribal as we've become,
I believe we've lost the ability

07:49.207 --> 07:54.125
to step into someone else's
shoes and walk around.

07:54.169 --> 07:56.345
But it is my hope
and my prayer

07:56.388 --> 07:59.609
that you will prove
my fear unfounded

07:59.653 --> 08:04.005
and bring in a verdict
based on the real understanding

08:04.048 --> 08:08.096
of who Moses Johnson is,

08:08.139 --> 08:10.881
not who the world
wants him to be.

08:16.365 --> 08:17.888
Thank you.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.709
Stop stop and frisk.

08:55.752 --> 08:58.494
Stop it.

08:58.538 --> 09:03.934
Every 800 stops the cops make,
they find a gun.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.240
Every 800.

09:05.283 --> 09:06.720
At what cost?

09:06.763 --> 09:10.419
That's 800 Black people
scared to death,

09:10.462 --> 09:12.116
frightened, that --

09:12.160 --> 09:16.686
that if they make one
false move, they'll get killed.

09:16.730 --> 09:19.559
Let the tail lights be.

09:19.602 --> 09:20.603
Right?

09:20.647 --> 09:22.431
Let them be.

09:22.474 --> 09:27.567
Until we figure out how to halt
the epidemic of Black death

09:27.610 --> 09:29.481
at the hands
of law enforcement,

09:29.525 --> 09:33.660
we have to stop
their encounters with us.

09:33.703 --> 09:39.622
Izzy, we are living in
a-a-a permanent state of fear,

09:39.666 --> 09:40.928
and there's a word
for that.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.712
It is called terrorism.

09:42.756 --> 09:46.760
The Chicago Police Department
is a terrorist organization.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.326
That's a big word.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.241
And it is one that
I have considered carefully.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.504
Does your husband
agree with what you've
just been saying?

09:55.507 --> 10:00.121
My husband doesn't have
to agree with anything
that I say or do.

10:00.164 --> 10:01.949
Okay.

10:01.992 --> 10:04.038
Girl,
you just lit it up.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.082
Did I?

10:05.126 --> 10:06.954
Social media's
going crazy.

10:06.997 --> 10:09.304
Chicago Police
are terrorists.

10:09.347 --> 10:10.697
Mm.
Yes.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.176
Okay.They are.

10:12.220 --> 10:15.919
Okay.
Photo op at the Rufus shrine.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.225
Uh, no.

10:17.268 --> 10:18.966
It's good to put a face
to a name.

10:19.009 --> 10:20.663
The Tribune'ssending
a reporter,

10:20.707 --> 10:23.579
AP and Reuters
want a picture of your feet.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.102
This is going national.

10:25.146 --> 10:29.237
You just became a big story,
Martha Roberts.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.674
I said no, Marisol.

10:31.718 --> 10:34.329
Is this about Franklin?

10:34.372 --> 10:36.026
'Cause the way
I look at it,

10:36.070 --> 10:38.115
if he's well enough
to be in court,

10:38.159 --> 10:41.553
you need to stay out here
and keep doing what you do.

10:41.597 --> 10:45.557
Martha, when I listen to you,
you inspire me,

10:45.601 --> 10:49.823
and you move people
to action.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.433
Let's go.

10:58.309 --> 11:01.182
Hey. You can't park here.
Move on.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.444
Yeah,
this is Norma Johnson.

11:02.487 --> 11:03.880
Uh, uh,
her son's on trial.

11:03.924 --> 11:06.143
I don't care if she's
the Queen of Sheba.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.275
Move on.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.059
My man, she's late.Phil.

11:09.103 --> 11:10.713
You really want to stop a mother
from seeing her son?

11:10.757 --> 11:12.062
That's it.
Out of the van.

11:12.106 --> 11:13.934
I'm just telling you.
She has to get in --

11:13.977 --> 11:15.849
Out of the van.
Now.

11:15.892 --> 11:18.242
Wow.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.027
Wow.

11:23.334 --> 11:25.467
Put your hands
on the van.Wow.

11:25.510 --> 11:28.731
Go in. Go in. I'm good.
I'm good. Go in. Go in.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.472
Come on, big man.Wow.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.561
Come on.

11:34.128 --> 11:36.173
The defense wants to talk
about context.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.740
He thinks I don't.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.525
Well, he's wrong.

11:40.569 --> 11:43.006
Is this a speech or --
or a question?

11:43.050 --> 11:45.008
I think it's a-a speech.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.227
Hey.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.315
I'm -- I'm sorry,
Your Honor.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.838
That-- That's my son.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.144
David.

11:50.187 --> 11:52.059
What's the story
with this corner?

11:52.102 --> 11:53.756
It's an open air
drug market.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.627
18, 19 hours a day.

11:55.671 --> 11:56.846
Who runs it?

11:56.890 --> 11:58.195
The Nation.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.327
Members of the gang
were out dealing

11:59.370 --> 12:00.676
when we arrived
that day.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.243
What happened?

12:02.286 --> 12:03.853
They took off running
once they saw us.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.855
We were able
to apprehend five.

12:05.899 --> 12:08.249
As we suspected,
we found sleet on scene.

12:08.292 --> 12:09.685
Sleet?

12:09.729 --> 12:10.773
Heroin.
Hmm.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.296
Fentanyl blend.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.734
It's a drug to die for --
and people do.
Hmm.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.736
It's also what we found
in the Johnson home.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.172
It was on this corner.

12:18.215 --> 12:21.349
in this context,
with these drugs on sale,

12:21.392 --> 12:23.177
run by this gang,

12:23.220 --> 12:25.745
where you arrested
the defendant's brother?

12:25.788 --> 12:28.269
Joshua Johnson was apprehended
at the scene.

12:28.312 --> 12:29.705
Was the accused present?

12:29.749 --> 12:31.185
10 feet from his brother.

12:31.228 --> 12:33.143
Five feet from the gang member
with the gun.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.797
In the mix, on the corner.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.538
What did he do
when you arrived?

12:36.581 --> 12:39.106
He ran.

12:39.149 --> 12:40.716
Were you present

12:40.760 --> 12:43.458
when the Johnson family home
was searched?

12:43.501 --> 12:45.677
Yes, I was.Was anything found?

12:45.721 --> 12:47.767
We found that
under her mattress.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.464
Lab tests show it came
from the same batch

12:49.507 --> 12:51.205
we seized on the corner.

12:51.248 --> 12:54.643
What was the quantity of sleet
found in the Johnson home?

12:54.686 --> 12:56.123
Enough to make me wonder
whether she might be

12:56.166 --> 12:57.602
the depot
supplying the corner.

12:57.646 --> 12:58.647
She?

12:58.690 --> 13:00.780
Norma Johnson.

13:00.823 --> 13:03.086
Have you come across
something like this before?

13:03.130 --> 13:05.523
The mule dressed
as a nun.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.482
I'm sorry?

13:07.525 --> 13:10.746
Nobody's gonna stop
and search a bride of
Christ at the airport.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.488
Just like nobody suspects
the homemaker mom

13:13.531 --> 13:15.142
is the heart
of a drug business.

13:24.629 --> 13:28.024
You found drugs
in the Johnson home?Correct.

13:28.068 --> 13:32.289
Enough for a possession
with intent to distribute rap?

13:32.333 --> 13:33.987
Yeah.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.292
Who did you charge?

13:35.336 --> 13:36.337
Nobody.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.254
I'm sorry?

13:40.297 --> 13:41.690
Nobody.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.866
Who did you arrest?

13:43.910 --> 13:45.172
No one.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.000
Wait -- Wait a minute.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.784
I don't understand.

13:48.828 --> 13:53.180
Two minutes ago, you said that
Norma Johnson was a player

13:53.223 --> 13:55.704
in a major drug
dealing business

13:55.747 --> 13:57.967
causing untold damage
in her community.

13:58.011 --> 13:59.316
We were looking for
her son.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.492
Why can't you do
two things at once?

14:01.536 --> 14:02.667
It about priorities.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.321
It was about
you planting drugs.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.193
We don't do that.Okay.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.891
Okay.

14:10.414 --> 14:13.156
Do you know what
the minimum wage is?

14:14.984 --> 14:16.246
20 bucks.

14:16.290 --> 14:19.597
Norma Johnson makes
$15.50 an hour

14:19.641 --> 14:22.557
cleaning this
entire courthouse.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.385
Is this a speech
or a question?

14:24.428 --> 14:29.781
How many kingpin drug dealers
do you know work night shifts

14:29.825 --> 14:32.828
cleaning public toilets?

14:35.918 --> 14:40.053
I don't do rhetorical
questions, Officer.

14:43.273 --> 14:44.492
None.

14:44.535 --> 14:46.059
Thank you.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.249
Your boy
was soft as hell.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.948
Want me to rough you up
a little?

15:05.992 --> 15:07.210
Maybe kick you
in the nuts

15:07.254 --> 15:08.733
so Norma can nurse them
better later?

15:08.777 --> 15:11.519
Yeah, very funny, Lieutenant.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.651
Remember what I told you
at the start of this?

15:13.695 --> 15:15.523
No, I don't.

15:15.566 --> 15:19.527
Don't fall in love,
and wear a condom.

15:19.570 --> 15:22.660
How's that going?

15:22.704 --> 15:24.749
I'm a pro, boss.

15:24.793 --> 15:26.751
I know you are.

15:26.795 --> 15:29.145
So, what have you got
for me?

15:29.189 --> 15:31.713
The brother.
Joshua.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.978
Okay, thank you,
Lieutenant.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.079
Didn't ask about the brother
in there.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.994
Joshua is
a traumatized child.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.300
I'm trying to keep him
out of this.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.693
It's funny how trauma
affects people.

15:55.737 --> 15:56.956
What do you want?

15:56.999 --> 15:58.566
How is all this
being paid for?

15:58.609 --> 16:01.308
The community knows when
one of its own needs support.

16:01.351 --> 16:03.571
That include
the drug dealing community?

16:03.614 --> 16:05.181
Who knew they were
so philanthropic?

16:05.225 --> 16:06.487
What are you
talking about?

16:06.530 --> 16:08.184
Giving Joshua a job
on the corner

16:08.228 --> 16:10.621
so that he can help
pay for you.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.362
It's heartwarming.

16:12.406 --> 16:13.929
Where are you
getting this?

16:13.973 --> 16:17.498
Come on. You know I'm not
revealing my sources.

16:17.541 --> 16:18.934
You could always
ask your wife.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.849
What does this have to do
with Martha?

16:20.892 --> 16:22.677
See, I've been puzzling why
a firebrand like her

16:22.720 --> 16:25.723
hasn't wanted to talk about
the Moses case more.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.464
Now I know.

16:27.508 --> 16:30.902
Her husband is getting
paid out of the sale
of street heroin.

16:30.946 --> 16:32.426
That kind of dirty money
in the family

16:32.469 --> 16:34.602
doesn't look so good when
you're standing for election

16:34.645 --> 16:36.560
on a fuck the police
platform.

16:38.693 --> 16:41.130
Call me if you want to quote
your denial or whatever.

16:46.744 --> 16:47.963
It's true.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.660
You -- You know?

16:49.704 --> 16:50.705
How?

16:52.924 --> 16:54.926
Rufus' mother,
Janet Porter.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.232
And you didn't tell me?

16:56.276 --> 16:57.799
'Cause of what I know
about her.

16:57.842 --> 17:02.195
What? What --
What do you know about her?

17:02.238 --> 17:05.894
Martha, this is the end
of your candidacy, my career,

17:05.937 --> 17:07.374
Moses' chances.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.071
You have to tell me.

17:14.207 --> 17:15.295
Rufus was a snitch.

17:15.338 --> 17:16.557
Wh-- What?

17:16.600 --> 17:18.385
Okay. Okay.Franklin, Franklin.

17:18.428 --> 17:19.864
You can't use this.

17:19.908 --> 17:22.128
If they know about
what Rufus was doing,

17:22.171 --> 17:23.520
they're gonna
come after Janet.

17:23.564 --> 17:26.045
The Nation is going to come
after her.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.133
You know how this goes.

17:27.176 --> 17:29.265
You know.

17:29.309 --> 17:30.919
Leave it alone.

17:36.142 --> 17:38.492
Defense counsel in the case
of Moses Johnson,

17:38.535 --> 17:40.450
please come to the court
immediately.

17:44.324 --> 17:48.545
Yo, homie, Dante needs you
to come through the spot.

17:48.589 --> 17:49.851
For what?

17:49.894 --> 17:51.026
He needs you to
come through now.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.593
Alright, man.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.468
Joshua.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.122
Deputy
The Judge is waiting, Counselor.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.689
Be safe.

18:01.732 --> 18:04.431
Counselor.
Coming.

18:06.563 --> 18:11.829
How did you get Moses' name
from his brother Joshua?

18:11.873 --> 18:14.484
I talked to him.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.051
That's it?

18:16.095 --> 18:19.098
Yeah.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.664
Okay.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.277
Take a look at this,
please.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.714
It's a copy of the record
of Joshua being booked

18:26.757 --> 18:29.369
into the precinct
by the Custody Sergeant.

18:29.412 --> 18:30.457
Yes.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.460
What time did he arrive?

18:33.503 --> 18:35.244
42.

18:35.288 --> 18:38.160
Ah.
Here he is leaving again.

18:38.204 --> 18:41.468
Time code15
on the video.

18:41.511 --> 18:45.167
Is that on the record?No.

18:45.211 --> 18:48.344
Ah.
Should it be?

18:48.388 --> 18:50.303
Yeah.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.174
Huh.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.915
Here he is coming back.

18:53.958 --> 18:58.876
Two hours
and nine minutes later.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.749
Is that on the record?

19:01.792 --> 19:04.186
No.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.753
Should it be?

19:12.890 --> 19:16.285
Did you take him out
for ice cream, Officer?

19:24.685 --> 19:26.208
Thank you, Officer.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.870
No. Wait.
No, I want to know.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.132
That's enough, young man.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.568
Did you take him out
for ice cream?

19:38.612 --> 19:40.222
Young man,
that is enough.Did you?

19:40.266 --> 19:41.702
No, it's not enough.
I want to know.

19:41.745 --> 19:43.312
That is enough.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.626
Where we going?

20:11.514 --> 20:12.733
Hey.

20:12.776 --> 20:15.083
Hey.

20:15.126 --> 20:16.650
They let you go?

20:18.782 --> 20:20.697
They didn't charge you?

20:20.741 --> 20:23.004
Just made
their feelings clear.

20:23.047 --> 20:26.094
Oh.
They hurt you?

20:26.137 --> 20:28.836
You know what I did
in there, right?

20:28.879 --> 20:31.795
Kept thinking of you.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.362
And then they couldn't
get to me.

20:33.406 --> 20:34.972
Yeah.

20:41.327 --> 20:46.810
B-R-A-N-N-I-G-A-N.

20:46.854 --> 20:49.683
Where were you when the accused
started talking?

20:49.726 --> 20:53.948
He started talking in the car
on the way to the station.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.906
Is that unusual?

20:55.950 --> 20:57.995
I've seen it
so many times.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.432
They feel better.

20:59.475 --> 21:01.956
It's called conscience.

21:01.999 --> 21:05.176
Funny how it goes away
once a lawyer steps in.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.526
Objection, Your Honor.

21:06.569 --> 21:08.441
Judge
Sustained.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.486
Would you care
to rephrase that?

21:11.922 --> 21:13.881
Okay.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.970
The last thing a lawyer
wants to be stuck with

21:16.013 --> 21:19.147
in a system like ours
is the truth.

21:19.190 --> 21:22.106
He needs his own version of it,
and to get that,

21:22.150 --> 21:24.413
he'll manipulate
and maneuver his client

21:24.457 --> 21:27.242
into telling him
what he wants to hear.

21:27.286 --> 21:30.506
Truth leaves the room
when the lawyer walks in.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.160
They're storytellers.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.822
Do you have children,
Lieutenant?

21:41.865 --> 21:43.345
Two boys.

21:43.389 --> 21:44.999
17 and 15.

21:45.042 --> 21:47.828
"Pursuant to my attempt
to escape,

21:47.871 --> 21:50.309
there was physical contact
between myself

21:50.352 --> 21:51.919
and the police officer."

21:51.962 --> 21:54.878
Your 15-year-old
ever sound like that?No.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.227
"Pursuant to"?

21:56.271 --> 21:57.794
"Physical contact"?

21:57.838 --> 21:59.056
Sound like
South Side talk?

21:59.100 --> 22:01.015
Eh, straight outta
Woodlawn?

22:01.058 --> 22:03.234
You write this?

22:03.278 --> 22:05.672
He started talking.
I listened.

22:05.715 --> 22:08.370
We wrote it down.

22:08.414 --> 22:12.200
This is a department report
of your shootings

22:12.243 --> 22:14.289
in the line of duty.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.118
Do you know how many people
you've shot?

22:17.161 --> 22:18.598
Every working cop
remembers

22:18.641 --> 22:20.730
each time they fired
their weapon.
Mm-hmm.

22:20.774 --> 22:23.646
I've had 6 shootings
in my 23 years on the job.

22:23.690 --> 22:25.822
You know how many of these
were Black men?

22:27.650 --> 22:30.044
All of them.Mm.

22:30.087 --> 22:32.046
Just protecting my guys.

22:32.089 --> 22:33.830
Should I not protect them
because of the color

22:33.874 --> 22:35.702
of the skin of the men
threatening them?

22:35.745 --> 22:38.400
Let's talk about the last
of these six shootings.

22:38.444 --> 22:39.967
What's the answer
to myquestion?

22:40.010 --> 22:41.577
Or are you avoiding
answering it?

22:41.621 --> 22:44.058
You don't get to ask the
questions in here, Lieutenant.

22:44.101 --> 22:46.408
As you well know.

22:46.452 --> 22:47.714
He had a weapon.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.498
He fired it.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.892
Police lives and the
lives of others were
in immediate danger.

22:51.935 --> 22:53.720
Was there an investigation
into his death?

22:53.763 --> 22:55.069
I went before
the review board.

22:55.112 --> 22:56.723
How long did that take?

22:56.766 --> 22:58.551
I testified for an hour.

22:58.594 --> 22:59.987
The board ruled it
was a good shoot.

23:00.030 --> 23:01.989
Can you tell me about
the CPD shootings

23:02.032 --> 23:05.514
the board have decided
were bad shoots?
No.

23:05.558 --> 23:08.212
Why not?Can't think of any.

23:08.256 --> 23:10.563
The whole weight
of the criminal justice system

23:10.606 --> 23:15.350
is bearing down on Moses,
here, today.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.048
You shoot Rufus.

23:18.092 --> 23:19.093
One hour?

23:19.136 --> 23:21.312
Case was clear cut.

23:21.356 --> 23:23.793
When you arrived on
the corner, were there
other cops with you?Yes.

23:23.837 --> 23:25.752
How many?
Six.

23:25.795 --> 23:28.015
All with weapons drawn?Yes.

23:28.058 --> 23:30.713
Any of them
fire at Rufus?
No.

23:30.757 --> 23:32.106
But you did.

23:32.149 --> 23:34.108
You made the decision
to end his life.

23:34.151 --> 23:35.326
That was you.

23:35.370 --> 23:36.980
I've been doing this job
23 years.

23:37.024 --> 23:38.678
I can think clearly
under pressure.

23:38.721 --> 23:40.114
So it wasn't
a gut reaction.

23:40.157 --> 23:43.465
It was --
It was calculated.

23:43.509 --> 23:46.773
Look, when a shot is fired
by a civilian

23:46.816 --> 23:48.862
and you're in close,

23:48.905 --> 23:53.040
a lot of officers' first
reaction is the same -- passive.

23:53.083 --> 23:56.435
The first three seconds
are about self-protection.

23:56.478 --> 24:00.047
You flinch, you're shocked,
then you react.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.963
As a leader of men, I'm trained
to do better than that.

24:03.006 --> 24:06.053
I have to be the first to
respond because I'm in charge.

24:06.096 --> 24:09.578
So, on that day, I was able
to go straight to reaction.

24:09.622 --> 24:11.928
The right reaction.Maybe
the other six officers

24:11.972 --> 24:15.149
had a better understanding
of -- of context.

24:15.192 --> 24:17.064
Or maybe
I saved their lives.

24:17.107 --> 24:18.718
You took a life
without understanding

24:18.761 --> 24:20.459
all that was going on.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.504
Rufus wasn't a danger
to your colleagues.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.158
You assumedhe was.

24:24.201 --> 24:25.812
You presumedhe was.

24:25.855 --> 24:28.379
I violated
no police procedure.

24:33.254 --> 24:35.648
What's his name?

24:35.691 --> 24:36.692
Rufus.

24:36.736 --> 24:38.781
Rufus what?

24:38.825 --> 24:40.261
I don't recall.

24:40.304 --> 24:42.437
What would you think of me
if I didn't remember

24:42.481 --> 24:43.743
your dead colleague's
last name?

24:43.786 --> 24:46.180
What if I said,
"Michael who?"

24:46.223 --> 24:48.661
What would you think
of me?

24:48.704 --> 24:52.316
Look, I-I-I'm sorry about
your colleague's death.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.493
I really am.

24:54.536 --> 24:57.757
But is Rufus Porter's life
less important,

24:57.800 --> 25:00.281
less worthy
than Michael Rossi's?

25:01.717 --> 25:03.153
All lives matter.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.638
What are
your children's names?

25:09.682 --> 25:10.683
Mark and Luke.

25:10.726 --> 25:13.207
Mark and Luke.

25:13.250 --> 25:17.037
Have you given Mark and Luke
the talk?

25:17.080 --> 25:19.735
What to do when they encounter
a police officer?

25:19.779 --> 25:20.954
Not necessary.

25:20.997 --> 25:23.173
Why not?
Because they're white?

25:23.217 --> 25:24.566
Just not needed.

25:24.610 --> 25:27.003
All Black parents have
that conversation

25:27.047 --> 25:28.570
with their children,
bar none.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.616
Are they wrong?
All of them?

25:30.659 --> 25:32.618
Yes.

25:32.661 --> 25:35.490
Huh.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.971
Is Moses safe
to put his hands up

25:38.014 --> 25:41.235
like Michael Brown
and Adam Toledo?

25:41.278 --> 25:42.671
Is -- Does he have --

25:42.715 --> 25:45.369
Is he entitled to, uh,
a little bit of fear

25:45.413 --> 25:49.112
that the policeman will
put a bullet in him anyway?

25:49.156 --> 25:52.115
Now you'remaking assumptions
and presumptions

25:52.159 --> 25:54.074
about all of us

25:54.117 --> 25:56.424
because of the uniform
we wear.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.469
There's a name for that.There is.

25:58.513 --> 26:01.255
And it's called
institutional racism,

26:01.298 --> 26:03.736
and your failure
to see it?

26:03.779 --> 26:05.346
That's the problem.

26:19.273 --> 26:21.449
Mrs. Roberts?

26:21.492 --> 26:22.668
Martha?

26:22.711 --> 26:24.017
That in there?

26:24.060 --> 26:26.106
Word for word.

26:26.149 --> 26:27.760
He is me.

26:27.803 --> 26:29.065
I am him.

26:29.109 --> 26:30.850
He spoke for all of us.

26:33.504 --> 26:35.506
Write that down
in your paper.

26:42.731 --> 26:46.953
I'm going to ask you to do
the hard part first.

26:46.996 --> 26:48.650
Okay.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.043
Will you tell us about

26:50.086 --> 26:53.307
Michael Rossi's last moment
on Earth?

26:53.350 --> 26:55.526
What did you see when
you arrived to the scene?

26:55.570 --> 26:59.182
Um...

26:59.226 --> 27:02.751
you know that picture
of Cassius Clay

27:02.795 --> 27:05.667
standing over Sonny Liston
after he knocked him out?

27:05.711 --> 27:07.190
Mm-hmm.

27:07.234 --> 27:08.801
Like he's taunting him?

27:11.325 --> 27:14.154
That's it.
That's what I saw.

27:14.197 --> 27:16.199
What did you do?

27:16.243 --> 27:19.681
The moment he saw me,
the defendant took off.

27:19.725 --> 27:22.858
Uh, up and over
the containers.

27:22.902 --> 27:24.512
And...

27:29.473 --> 27:32.825
...Michael was, uh,
just lying there.

27:34.478 --> 27:36.045
Wasn't moving.

27:40.789 --> 27:43.966
I went over. I tried --
I tried to help him...

27:46.099 --> 27:47.970
...a-and...

27:48.014 --> 27:50.277
Hey.
Take your time.

27:54.498 --> 27:55.891
Well, his head was --

27:55.935 --> 27:58.024
was bleeding, uh,
from a head injury.

27:58.067 --> 28:00.896
Th-Th-There was
a lot of blood.

28:00.940 --> 28:02.681
What did you do?

28:07.033 --> 28:08.251
I tried.

28:08.295 --> 28:11.864
I-I-I tried
to keep him with me.

28:11.907 --> 28:13.300
I kept trying.

28:13.343 --> 28:14.867
I'm s-- I'm sorry.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.871
Okay.

28:25.834 --> 28:28.750
Do you recognize these?Yes.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.752
The clothes I was wearing
that day.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.188
Mm-hmm.

28:46.072 --> 28:47.638
And the blood stains?

28:52.121 --> 28:54.645
Michael's.

29:30.420 --> 29:32.161
He's doing well
in there.

29:40.866 --> 29:42.215
You're fucking him,
aren't you?

30:08.545 --> 30:11.505
ShotSpotter picked up
three different shots

30:11.548 --> 30:15.117
within the vicinity
and timeframe of the incident.

30:15.161 --> 30:18.381
Two that we can account for.

30:18.425 --> 30:23.169
One shot from a weapon
belonging to Rufus Porter.

30:23.212 --> 30:27.042
The second from
Lieutenant Brannigan.

30:27.086 --> 30:33.875
3 minutes and 55 seconds later,
a third shot was fired.

30:33.919 --> 30:38.053
Now, your incident report
made no mention

30:38.097 --> 30:39.838
of you drawing your weapon.

30:44.494 --> 30:46.888
Because I didn't.

30:46.932 --> 30:49.369
So, the third shot
wasn't you?

30:49.412 --> 30:51.414
Wasn't me.

30:51.458 --> 30:54.026
You're sure about that?

30:54.069 --> 30:57.594
I didn't fire my gun.

30:57.638 --> 30:59.727
How long have you had
your service weapon?

31:01.772 --> 31:03.426
Six years.

31:03.470 --> 31:04.993
And it was the weapon
you carried with you

31:05.037 --> 31:06.168
on the day in question?

31:07.778 --> 31:10.825
Yes.

31:10.869 --> 31:14.002
Did you bring your weapon
with you to court today?

31:14.046 --> 31:16.657
Yes.

31:16.700 --> 31:17.919
Where is it?

31:19.834 --> 31:21.923
In a locker downstairs.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.578
Your Honor, the defense
admits into evidence

31:24.621 --> 31:28.451
a 9 millimeter bullet found
in the vicinity of the incident.

31:28.495 --> 31:30.889
We request that Officer Logan's
service weapon

31:30.932 --> 31:32.325
be retrieved immediately

31:32.368 --> 31:34.588
for ballistic testing
against the bullet.

31:34.631 --> 31:36.503
Objection.
You got to be kidding me.

31:36.546 --> 31:38.070
Judge
Get up here, both of you.

31:42.596 --> 31:45.033
They don't have thebullet.
They have abullet.

31:45.077 --> 31:47.253
The ballistics tests we'd run
can't be done without notice.

31:47.296 --> 31:49.908
We're mid-trial.
We are being ambushed here.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.170
I agree.

31:51.213 --> 31:52.954
But Office Logan
is expert enough.

31:52.998 --> 31:54.303
He can tell if the bullet
fits the gun.

31:54.347 --> 31:56.218
That's a yes or no.

31:56.262 --> 31:58.003
We'll take it from there.

32:02.007 --> 32:03.312
Let the record show
that the Deputy

32:03.356 --> 32:04.923
is being ordered
by the court to retrieve

32:04.966 --> 32:07.055
Officer Logan's
service weapon.

32:07.099 --> 32:09.579
Court will remain in session
in the duration.

32:52.100 --> 32:55.277
Deputy
Retrieved a .45-caliber
Smith & Wesson handgun

32:55.321 --> 32:58.411
from the courthouse locker
assigned to Officer Logan.

33:03.155 --> 33:04.721
Judge
Defense Exhibit C.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.812
Your Honor,
may I approach?

33:14.993 --> 33:17.343
Your Honor,
there seems to be a mix-up.

33:17.386 --> 33:19.040
It's -- It's not --I gave you a lot of leeway

33:19.084 --> 33:20.737
to introduce
this evidence impromptu,

33:20.781 --> 33:24.176
so I'm gonna insist
you get on with it.

33:24.219 --> 33:25.699
Yes, Your Honor.

33:48.635 --> 33:49.897
What's the question,
Counselor?

33:49.940 --> 33:52.595
We're all waiting.

33:52.639 --> 33:55.511
Is this your service weapon,
Officer?

33:55.555 --> 33:57.035
It's my gun.

33:57.078 --> 33:59.037
And this is the same gun
you carried on the day?

33:59.080 --> 34:00.125
Same one.

34:01.996 --> 34:05.086
I remind you
that you are under oath.

34:08.002 --> 34:09.656
It's my gun.

34:12.441 --> 34:14.791
Judge
Moving on, Counselor.

34:14.835 --> 34:16.576
Your Honor, we ask
that the record reflect

34:16.619 --> 34:20.145
Officer Logan's weapon
is a .45-caliber pistol.

34:20.188 --> 34:22.190
It does not match
the 9 millimeter slug

34:22.234 --> 34:24.105
the defense has submitted
for evidence.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.709
He's lying, isn't he?

35:11.109 --> 35:13.154
Can we talk?

35:13.198 --> 35:14.851
There's -- There's something
you need to know.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.549
You're scaring me.

35:16.592 --> 35:20.944
What you've been doing is
a wonderful thing, Miss Norma.

35:20.988 --> 35:23.295
You -- God knows where
you found the strength

35:23.338 --> 35:25.993
to campaign
and raise money and --

35:26.036 --> 35:27.342
It's my son.
It's only money.

35:27.386 --> 35:29.605
Yeah, but that's --
that's the thing.

35:29.649 --> 35:30.954
What?

35:30.998 --> 35:32.347
The money.

35:32.391 --> 35:33.827
It's dirty.

35:33.870 --> 35:35.133
No.

35:35.176 --> 35:36.699
No.

35:36.743 --> 35:38.440
We got the money from friends
and the community

35:38.484 --> 35:40.399
and Joshua's been --Joshua.

35:41.791 --> 35:43.271
Joshua what?

35:43.315 --> 35:45.055
He's not working.

35:45.099 --> 35:47.797
What do you mean
Joshua's not working?

35:49.190 --> 35:50.365
He's selling.

35:50.409 --> 35:52.367
That's where the money's
coming from.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.022
Where is he?

35:56.545 --> 35:58.373
Come on, boy.

36:03.770 --> 36:05.337
Open that shit up.

36:09.471 --> 36:11.038
Come on, boy.

36:30.405 --> 36:33.016
The boys didn't hear nothing
last night then, huh?

36:35.280 --> 36:37.195
I see you learned
that lesson well.

36:39.240 --> 36:43.070
If you gonna steal,
steal it all.

36:59.826 --> 37:02.132
When was you gonna tell me
about this?

37:06.876 --> 37:08.356
Yo, how long you known
about this, man?

37:08.400 --> 37:09.618
Yo, get up out of here,
bro.

37:09.662 --> 37:11.011
Get up out of here,
bro!

37:11.054 --> 37:12.360
Ooh.
Huh?

37:12.404 --> 37:14.014
About what?

37:14.057 --> 37:15.145
About my baby brother
who I've been a father to

37:15.189 --> 37:16.495
for years
while you been away.

37:16.538 --> 37:18.279
Do you hear me?
Who I've been a father to.

37:18.323 --> 37:19.933
I did your job
'cause you weren't there,

37:19.976 --> 37:21.108
and now you do this?

37:21.151 --> 37:22.849
What is wrong with you,
man?

37:22.892 --> 37:23.893
He wanted in.

37:23.937 --> 37:25.373
He's smart.

37:25.417 --> 37:27.854
He's bringing in paper
and earning his keep.

37:27.897 --> 37:29.247
Yeah, I respect that.

37:29.290 --> 37:30.291
You respect that?
What is wrong with you?

37:30.335 --> 37:32.162
What kind of man are you?
Hmm?

37:32.206 --> 37:34.339
The kind of man who knows
what's best for his boys.

37:34.382 --> 37:35.427
Yeah. Okay.
Alright?

37:35.470 --> 37:37.080
Alright?
Alright.

37:37.124 --> 37:39.344
Joshua ain't a track star
like you.

37:39.387 --> 37:42.260
He's taking care of his mother
and himself

37:42.303 --> 37:44.653
more than you can
or ever will be.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.220
Whatever.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.222
Be somebody's daddy for once
in your life, bro.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.789
That's what
you need to do.

37:57.710 --> 37:59.494
Why am I even here?

37:59.538 --> 38:01.279
I'm gonna go out there
and pull him off

38:01.322 --> 38:02.497
of whatever corner
he's on.No, no, no. Come here.

38:02.541 --> 38:05.674
No, no, no.
You let me do that.

38:05.718 --> 38:06.762
Alright?

38:06.806 --> 38:08.503
Come on.

38:08.547 --> 38:11.463
Come on. Come on.

38:17.164 --> 38:18.731
How'd they know
about the gun?

38:20.559 --> 38:22.822
How would they know
about a thing like that?

39:03.428 --> 39:05.473
Yeah?Yeah, Brannigan?

39:05.517 --> 39:08.781
Yeah, Joshua.
Yeah, I need help finding him.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.444
Pop the glovebox.

39:30.150 --> 39:31.238
Hand it to me.

39:49.430 --> 39:51.214
I know you took money,
too.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.565
I know.
I -- And I shouldn't have.

39:55.958 --> 39:57.786
I-I needed it.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.015
So, what you think
happens now?

40:14.803 --> 40:15.891
I don't know.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.458
Sure you do.

40:22.332 --> 40:23.638
Betrayed the trust
I put in you.

40:23.682 --> 40:24.987
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Dante, wait, man.

40:25.031 --> 40:27.076
Shh.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.991
Come on, man.
You ain't got to do this, man.

40:30.384 --> 40:32.604
Dante.

40:33.822 --> 40:35.389
Huh.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.869
I --
Hey, man, you --
you ain't got to --

40:36.912 --> 40:37.913
you ain't got to
do this.

40:37.957 --> 40:41.047
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

40:43.353 --> 40:47.488
I owe your old man --
from way back.

40:50.839 --> 40:55.322
Not killing you now,
that's my debt to Speak.

40:56.454 --> 40:59.326
You do this again...

40:59.369 --> 41:01.763
Ah.

41:01.807 --> 41:03.373
Alright.

41:17.213 --> 41:18.867
You mine now.

41:23.045 --> 41:27.136
And this yours now.

41:31.576 --> 41:34.056
We gonna get TJ.

41:34.100 --> 41:36.406
In the meantime,
you best stay strapped.

41:37.973 --> 41:40.236
I need to see if you about
this life for real.

41:49.811 --> 41:51.421
Watch your back,
lil' man.

42:11.354 --> 42:13.661
I don't care
who we take down.

42:13.705 --> 42:15.968
These people are
all the same to me.

42:16.011 --> 42:18.797
But they havegot to be
paying for that pass--

42:18.840 --> 42:20.538
The Faction.

42:20.581 --> 42:21.930
Paying who?

42:21.974 --> 42:23.671
It's just where
the heat is now.

42:25.499 --> 42:27.283
He got a name,

42:27.327 --> 42:29.024
your man in The Nation?

42:29.068 --> 42:30.678
Yeah.

42:30.722 --> 42:32.158
Tutu.

42:36.510 --> 42:38.686
You got a reception problem
in here.

42:38.730 --> 42:40.775
I keep --
keep leaving messages.

42:40.819 --> 42:42.908
The reception's fine.

42:42.951 --> 42:44.953
Let me get
another one.

42:46.825 --> 42:48.522
My experience?

42:48.566 --> 42:50.132
This a good time to start
thinking about

42:50.176 --> 42:51.917
who you trust
to give you a ride home.

42:51.960 --> 42:54.876
You keep drinking,
I'll have to take your keys.

42:54.920 --> 42:57.923
Can you really trust
anybody these days?

42:57.966 --> 43:01.230
That's a hell
of a question.

43:01.274 --> 43:03.276
Focuses the mind.

43:03.319 --> 43:05.452
What does?

43:05.495 --> 43:08.107
Dying.

43:13.808 --> 43:15.244
I step out the courtroom,
you're gone?

43:15.288 --> 43:16.724
No heads up,
no debrief.

43:16.768 --> 43:17.943
They switched the gun,
Nicole.

43:17.986 --> 43:20.206
They switched the damn gun.
How?

43:20.249 --> 43:22.556
Franklin.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.210
Somebody warned them.

43:24.253 --> 43:28.867
I told Norma about the bullet,
and one other person.

43:32.653 --> 43:35.438
Officer Logan's annual
firearms qualification,

43:35.482 --> 43:37.179
from six months ago.

43:37.223 --> 43:41.140
His service weapon is listed
as a nine millimeter Glock.

43:41.183 --> 43:45.623
He said he had the .45
for six years.

43:45.666 --> 43:48.930
Yeah, he lied,
and this proves it.

43:48.974 --> 43:51.150
I'm not the leak,

43:51.193 --> 43:53.935
and I'm not the one
keeping secrets, Franklin.

43:53.979 --> 43:57.156
Five bathroom breaks
in one day.

43:57.199 --> 43:59.114
My dad passed
two kidney stones.

43:59.158 --> 44:02.640
I know what that looks like.
It's not this.

44:02.683 --> 44:05.512
Does Moses know?

44:05.555 --> 44:07.993
Or are you lying
to him, too?

44:17.959 --> 44:20.005
Dylan Thomas.

44:20.048 --> 44:22.921
"Do not go gentle
into that good night.

44:22.964 --> 44:27.882
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light."

44:27.926 --> 44:29.449
Rage.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.627
Rage.

44:35.498 --> 44:37.936
Rage.

44:37.979 --> 44:41.200
Yeah?

44:41.243 --> 44:42.680
We got eyes on Joshua.

45:03.526 --> 45:05.398
Hey!

45:05.441 --> 45:06.965
Joshua!

45:09.315 --> 45:10.577
Your mama knows
everything.

45:12.448 --> 45:14.886
It's cool. Hey.
But you need to call her now

45:14.929 --> 45:16.757
and let her know
you're safe

45:16.801 --> 45:18.411
then we'll figure
how to handle this.

45:18.454 --> 45:19.542
Get in.

46:07.634 --> 46:09.418
It took him two weeks

46:09.462 --> 46:11.116
deciding what to get you
for your birthday.

46:11.159 --> 46:13.161
He wouldn't stop
talking about it.

46:14.380 --> 46:18.123
Should it be black
or silver?

46:18.166 --> 46:23.128
Does a nine millimeter Glock
look better in black or silver?

46:23.171 --> 46:25.478
Jessica --When the Deputy came into
court today with that gun,

46:25.521 --> 46:29.830
I saw your face, and I
watched you decide to lie.

46:29.874 --> 46:32.224
What did you expect me to do?!
Tell the truth?!

46:32.267 --> 46:33.616
'Cause you know
what that'll mean?

46:33.660 --> 46:35.183
That means Michael's killer
goes free.

46:35.227 --> 46:36.663
Is that what you want?

46:42.930 --> 46:44.584
You want the truth?

46:46.716 --> 46:48.327
Well,
here's the truth.

46:51.634 --> 46:53.245
I love you.

46:58.293 --> 47:01.166
I love you.Oh, my...

47:01.209 --> 47:02.558
Oh, Jesus.

48:12.454 --> 48:14.239
He got a name,

48:14.282 --> 48:16.719
your man in The Nation?Yeah.

48:16.763 --> 48:18.983
What are you doing?
What -- What is this?

48:21.072 --> 48:23.857
It's Tutu.

48:23.901 --> 48:25.772
Who?
Rufus.

48:31.125 --> 48:33.345
Okay.
What about him?

48:33.388 --> 48:34.955
He was a problem.

48:34.999 --> 48:36.914
For who?

48:36.957 --> 48:39.133
For Brannigan.

48:39.177 --> 48:40.787
It was not
a good shoot.

48:40.830 --> 48:44.138
It was an execution.

48:44.182 --> 48:45.792
It changes everything.

48:48.099 --> 48:49.665
You can't use this,
Franklin.

48:52.364 --> 48:54.932
If you use this,
Janet Porter dies.

48:58.500 --> 49:00.850
Franklin, look,

49:00.894 --> 49:03.070
if you use this,

49:03.114 --> 49:04.767
I can't live with you.

49:07.422 --> 49:10.599
It's Moses or me.

49:10.643 --> 49:12.166
That's your choice.

49:32.056 --> 49:34.145
On the next episode
of "61st Street"...

49:34.188 --> 49:35.363
Tell Dante Martha Roberts
needs a face-to-face.

49:35.407 --> 49:37.235
Y'all cowards!
Y'all cowards!

49:37.278 --> 49:40.020
The judge say the defense
you're running is reckless.

49:40.064 --> 49:41.543
We need to get this
under control.

49:41.587 --> 49:45.286
There is something foul
about your lieutenant.

49:45.330 --> 49:48.768
Michael Rossi was prepared
to follow his conscience.

49:48.811 --> 49:50.030
Are you?

49:50.074 --> 49:51.249
You had the guns
switched?

49:51.292 --> 49:52.859
Deputy, remove the jury.

49:52.902 --> 49:55.209
I'm calling you out.
