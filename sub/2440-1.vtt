00:04.170 --> 00:04.829
Inui!

00:07.240 --> 00:08.605
Put on your helmet!

00:11.077 --> 00:11.873
Inui!

00:22.989 --> 00:25.525
This is a warning to the
soldiers who are trapped inside!

00:25.525 --> 00:27.360
You have been relieved of duty.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.760
You are not authorized to
carry or use any weapons.

00:29.996 --> 00:33.397
Disarm and surrender immediately!

00:33.800 --> 00:38.464
I repeat!
Disarm and surrender immediately!

00:46.946 --> 00:49.682
First, Second and Third platoon:

00:49.682 --> 00:52.651
Assemble at the Central Hall
with 202 gear suits immediately!

00:52.986 --> 00:54.087
To all platoon commanders!

00:54.087 --> 00:55.588
Release the radio
blockade immediately...

00:55.588 --> 00:57.021
...once the battle commences.

00:57.123 --> 00:59.523
Report the operational range
of your division radio.

01:00.693 --> 01:02.888
From headquarters to
all supporting units!

01:03.229 --> 01:06.433
You will be relieved of all
your duties as of 0200.

01:06.433 --> 01:06.733
Prepare arms and stand by for orders
from your division commanders.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.998
Prepare arms and stand by for orders
from your division commanders.
How many days have gone by already?

01:13.206 --> 01:19.076
Probably three days,
maybe three weeks...

01:20.847 --> 01:25.477
Hasn't it been three years already?

01:27.320 --> 01:29.550
Koichi Todome, Midori Washio,
and Soichiroh Tobe...

01:29.722 --> 01:34.921
...of first platoon party must report
to headquarters immediately!

01:35.261 --> 01:36.228
I repeat.

01:36.496 --> 01:40.433
Koichi Todome, Midori Washio,
Soichiroh Tobe...

01:40.433 --> 01:43.960
...must report to headquarters
immediately!

01:44.471 --> 01:58.010
It was the time when dogs were swept away
from the street, and people started to seek
their own prosperity. But anyone that went
against the social stream were oppressed and
forgotten by society.

01:59.219 --> 02:20.905
The riots were over and became just a part of
history. The government officials had
completely oppressed and annihilated the
opposition. However, this lead to another
battle against the elite security unit that is
known as "Kerberos," who refused the order
from their officials to disband. It created a
symbolic figure at the end of this age.
It was a rebellion of watchdogs who had lost
their masters.

02:42.896 --> 02:46.599
Koichi Todome, Midori Washio,
and Soichiroh Tobe...

02:46.599 --> 02:51.036
...of first platoon must report to
headquarters immediately!

02:52.172 --> 02:53.439
I repeat!

02:53.439 --> 02:57.110
First platoon members:
Koichi Todome...

02:57.110 --> 03:01.206
...Midori Washio, and Soichiroh Tobe
report to headquarters immediately!

04:18.992 --> 04:20.254
Where are you going?

04:22.428 --> 04:23.895
Why are you running away?

04:24.998 --> 04:26.465
"Don't stop fighting!"

04:27.533 --> 04:29.433
You gave me that order!

06:43.703 --> 06:45.136
Are you Japanese?

06:45.238 --> 06:47.069
What do I look like?

06:49.675 --> 06:52.576
I'm Hayashi of
the Fugitive Support Group.

06:54.113 --> 06:57.183
It took a while to confirm your
identity at headquarters.

06:57.183 --> 07:00.152
As you know, it has been three years
since your group was destroyed.

07:00.987 --> 07:05.287
These days, most people don't even
remember the incident anymore.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.294
Excuse me, can I get chow-mein?

07:10.163 --> 07:15.191
Three years ago is just like
the day before yesterday.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.962
You must be joking.

07:25.178 --> 07:29.979
You left Japan while on parole.
That's a very serious action.

07:32.385 --> 07:35.254
I'll tell you about Koichi Todome,
who you requested us to investigate.

07:35.254 --> 07:39.657
After he escaped from Japan, he drifted
from South America to Central America...

07:39.926 --> 07:42.588
and finally arrived in this
country at the end of last year.

07:42.795 --> 07:46.165
However, he became involved with
a local criminal organization...

07:46.165 --> 07:48.326
...and was taken off of our list.

07:50.503 --> 07:53.495
I guess he needed big money.

07:56.008 --> 07:58.533
It's not so uncommon for a refugee.

08:02.014 --> 08:04.016
You must already know...

08:04.016 --> 08:07.577
...but supporters of our organization
hate this type of trouble.

08:08.421 --> 08:14.656
Usually, we're not supposed to
give out this kind of information.

08:40.119 --> 08:41.881
I don't know about her background.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.723
Her name is Tang Mie.

08:47.593 --> 08:49.493
How the mighty have fallen.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.732
I can't believe that he was
once the leader of "Kerberos"...

08:52.732 --> 08:54.495
...which terrified an entire metropolis.

08:54.767 --> 08:58.203
He escaped from his country with
determination to continue the battle...

08:58.538 --> 09:04.602
...and rebuild his organization,
but after all he set out to do...

09:41.314 --> 09:42.406
Who is it?

10:26.993 --> 10:28.654
Are you looking for Koichi?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.530
Did you come from Japan to find him?

10:34.900 --> 10:38.768
He left here three months ago,
and hasn't been back since.

10:39.672 --> 10:40.573
Left?

10:40.573 --> 10:43.599
He took his precious suitcase
and was gone.

10:44.477 --> 10:51.906
He left here before and I had to go
bring him back every time.

10:55.187 --> 10:58.987
But this time it seems
he's gone really far away.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.191
He's still sending me money
once a month from Tainan.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.340
I didn't know you had that much money.

14:42.514 --> 14:44.038
I sold the condo.

14:44.183 --> 14:45.241
Sold?

14:46.385 --> 14:48.717
I was planning to hire a
private detective to find him.

14:48.854 --> 14:51.789
I'm glad you came.
You can save me some time.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.460
I'm not a private detective.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.451
Then there's no charge for this.

14:56.595 --> 14:58.586
Of course, I'm going to
pay all the expenses.

15:49.081 --> 15:55.987
I don't know what I'm gonna
do to him if I find him first.

15:57.056 --> 15:58.853
Are you going to kill Koichi?

16:00.459 --> 16:01.426
I don't know.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.250
No, you won't!

16:03.896 --> 16:04.885
Why?

16:05.364 --> 16:07.457
You don't look like a bad guy.

16:08.701 --> 16:11.829
How do you know that?

16:13.305 --> 16:16.001
Oh, so you're saying
you are a bad guy?

16:16.909 --> 16:19.901
I don't really know.

16:21.780 --> 16:24.271
You don't know anything.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.486
I knew that from the moment I saw you.

16:59.818 --> 17:02.480
I heard that you were
dumped by someone before.

18:21.333 --> 18:24.200
What are we going to do now?

19:35.240 --> 19:36.298
Inui!

21:03.228 --> 21:06.391
Why did you come
to a place like this?

21:07.799 --> 21:10.825
I had no other place to be.

21:13.372 --> 21:16.000
I smelled my comrade
and came to this crowd.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.604
But it seems like there's
no place for me to stay here.

21:20.412 --> 21:23.677
I'm still a human inside,
even if I was trained to be a dog.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.283
Why are you here?

21:29.421 --> 21:30.319
Me?

21:32.157 --> 21:34.148
I have a purpose.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.086
A purpose?

21:37.229 --> 21:38.594
I'll tell you sometime.

21:47.205 --> 21:49.070
Do you like to take orders?

21:51.209 --> 21:52.642
Who knows?

21:54.613 --> 21:56.012
I like it.

21:59.551 --> 22:00.540
However...

22:01.520 --> 22:04.250
I want to choose my own master.

22:05.857 --> 22:07.051
Master?

22:10.362 --> 22:12.421
That which I want to be faithful to.

22:15.133 --> 22:17.499
Like a nation or a thought.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.735
There are a lot of those
things to choose from...

22:22.541 --> 22:24.702
...but what's best for me
is most important.

22:52.137 --> 22:55.903
The only thing we can do is to choose.

22:57.976 --> 23:02.037
I wish we both could find
masters who we won't regret.

33:14.892 --> 33:16.416
They are stray dogs.

33:17.428 --> 33:19.828
Someone might have
dumped them, or they got lost.

33:20.765 --> 33:22.756
There are so many of
them around here.

33:25.036 --> 33:28.206
They co-exist with humans,
but from a careful distance.

33:28.206 --> 33:31.004
But they'll never open
themselves to humans.

33:32.477 --> 33:35.246
They hold a strong grudge against
the humans who dumped them...

33:35.246 --> 33:38.044
...but they also miss the smell
of their masters so much.

33:42.620 --> 33:45.384
They are eternally ambivalent.

33:49.794 --> 33:52.786
But they're animals no matter what.

33:53.297 --> 34:00.635
They will never know the reason
why their master had to dump them.

34:02.306 --> 34:04.297
What are you talking about?

34:09.080 --> 34:17.487
I'm going to talk about an impressive
but tragic story about a dog...

34:18.456 --> 34:23.257
...who is looking for his
master and his future.

34:25.396 --> 34:28.422
He looked around for
the master he imagined...

34:30.068 --> 34:37.132
...running continuously
on his bloody feet.

34:39.177 --> 34:42.908
Finally, this faithful dog even
climbed over the Rocky Mountains.

34:47.918 --> 34:51.922
But, after he met the master
who he had been dreaming of...

34:51.922 --> 34:53.914
...what was really waiting for him?

35:02.100 --> 35:08.630
There is a proper reason
why people dump their dogs.

35:11.509 --> 35:15.639
You can even call it a
historical necessity.

35:19.183 --> 35:21.242
No matter how unreasonable
it may sound...

35:21.986 --> 35:24.755
...the dog has to pay for any
misfortune on his own...

35:24.755 --> 35:27.656
...even if he couldn't
understand the reason why.

35:28.960 --> 35:36.560
That's the only lesson
and the saddest lesson...

35:38.236 --> 35:41.228
...that humans and dogs have to learn.

35:47.545 --> 35:49.638
Why don't you use your
brain a little more?

35:54.886 --> 35:57.980
Lassie! Lassie!

36:02.426 --> 36:05.987
Hang on Lassie!

36:08.232 --> 36:11.065
Mistuwa! Mitsuwa!

36:12.770 --> 36:17.639
Lassie of Mitsuwa!

38:14.992 --> 38:15.924
Hey!

38:16.661 --> 38:17.561
Inui!

38:17.561 --> 38:18.459
Come here.

38:32.777 --> 38:33.944
Inui!

38:33.944 --> 38:35.070
Come on, let's go!

41:54.845 --> 41:55.812
Excuse me...

42:12.530 --> 42:13.428
Koichi!

42:18.335 --> 42:19.063
Hey!

42:23.007 --> 42:24.406
Coward!

42:24.508 --> 42:25.406
Shut up!

42:25.543 --> 42:26.744
Sex maniac!

42:26.744 --> 42:28.234
Lolita complex!

42:33.284 --> 42:34.251
Let go of me!

45:10.007 --> 45:11.770
You did a great job of finding me.

45:36.900 --> 45:42.896
You got out of jail amazingly quick.

45:44.508 --> 45:51.471
I was given a separate trial and
was a well-behaved model prisoner.

45:53.717 --> 45:57.380
After I was paroled,
I forged a passport and flew here.

45:58.889 --> 46:00.357
It was just because...

46:00.357 --> 46:03.588
You had something to tell me.

46:07.030 --> 46:13.731
I just wanted to ask you
what should I do from now on?

46:21.745 --> 46:26.444
I don't have any right to
give you a command now.

46:39.496 --> 46:43.455
Why don't you live here for a while?

46:45.135 --> 46:47.126
This is a really nice place.

46:47.704 --> 46:50.036
This place has good weather
and delicious fish to eat.

46:50.741 --> 46:55.576
Besides, I have money from
the condo that Tang Mie sold.

46:58.115 --> 46:58.945
But...

47:00.684 --> 47:01.651
She's...

47:07.291 --> 47:09.191
That's why we should
all live together.

47:10.194 --> 47:10.922
Right?

48:01.411 --> 48:02.844
Hey Inui!

48:07.885 --> 48:09.614
Isn't this place large enough?

48:10.220 --> 48:13.519
Three people can easily live here
together if we fix it up a little bit.

48:15.125 --> 48:16.092
Now...

48:19.129 --> 48:21.427
...let's talk about the rent!

48:26.136 --> 48:32.542
You two look pretty strong,
so if you both work hard...

48:32.542 --> 48:34.942
...I'll give you a raise.

48:43.453 --> 48:44.221
Hey! Hey! Hey!

48:44.221 --> 48:46.883
You pulled up your ass too high!
Drop your ass!

48:47.224 --> 48:48.282
You idiot!

48:49.459 --> 48:51.188
Come on!
Hurry up!

48:52.396 --> 48:55.229
Hey, what are you doing?!
Do it quickly!

48:55.499 --> 48:58.491
Don't open your arms so wide!
Close your arms!

48:59.002 --> 49:01.630
Come on!
What the hell are you doing?!

49:01.805 --> 49:04.207
Damn it! You'll never finish
this until the sun goes down!

49:04.207 --> 49:05.469
Hey! Are you playing with yourself?

49:13.116 --> 49:14.014
Idiot!

49:15.419 --> 49:17.216
You're ten years early!

49:21.558 --> 49:23.753
It's ten years before you can do that!

55:33.229 --> 55:34.594
What are you doing?!

55:37.534 --> 55:39.559
The eyeballs are the most delicious part!
The eyeballs!

57:01.584 --> 57:03.575
I didn't know she was that scary.

57:09.058 --> 57:10.992
You picked up quite a girl.

57:18.668 --> 57:23.469
You still don't get it?

57:27.644 --> 57:29.635
I'm not the one who picked her up.

57:31.881 --> 57:34.213
She's the one who
picked you and me up.

57:46.129 --> 57:49.621
I wonder...
You still haven't... with her?

58:05.582 --> 58:07.174
What the hell is so funny?!

58:10.420 --> 58:12.285
Shut the fuck up!

01:02:13.228 --> 01:02:13.956
Inui!

01:02:17.232 --> 01:02:18.164
Inui!

01:02:41.222 --> 01:02:42.120
Hello!

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:56.398
This is Hayashi.

01:04:02.037 --> 01:04:03.561
You look angry.

01:04:07.175 --> 01:04:10.178
Although he is out of
our support group...

01:04:10.178 --> 01:04:13.511
...we still have taken an interest
in Koichi Todome.

01:04:14.482 --> 01:04:17.110
He's just like a bomb to us.

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:22.951
If he attracts attention
from officials...

01:04:23.625 --> 01:04:26.461
...our organization, which is
supporting many other exiles...

01:04:26.461 --> 01:04:28.759
...would be in extreme jeopardy.

01:04:30.832 --> 01:04:35.929
And, that might become a reality.

01:04:37.539 --> 01:04:41.805
People might have forgotten about it,
but they haven't.

01:04:45.947 --> 01:04:51.252
Especially, the officials
obsessed with the riot...

01:04:51.252 --> 01:04:55.689
...but gave you parole
after only three years.

01:04:56.157 --> 01:04:59.260
Isn't it strange they overlooked
your departure?

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:01.524
Didn't you think it was suspicious?

01:05:06.935 --> 01:05:09.738
Dogs can overcome
any kind of difficulties...

01:05:09.738 --> 01:05:11.433
...to go back to their masters.

01:05:13.675 --> 01:05:16.405
It's an unfortunate
fatal habit for them.

01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:31.155
Please tell him.

01:05:31.693 --> 01:05:36.153
If he surrenders without resistance,
we'll leave you and her alone.

01:05:36.831 --> 01:05:38.822
I made a deal with the officials.

01:05:39.267 --> 01:05:42.998
With the condition that
you guys never go back to Japan.

01:05:44.339 --> 01:05:48.503
They can't act too wild in this country.

01:05:49.377 --> 01:05:50.969
I think it is a fair deal.

01:05:53.181 --> 01:05:56.912
I'll be waiting at the hotel on
the National Route, 5 kilometers north.

01:05:57.519 --> 01:06:00.750
You have until sunset.

01:06:04.359 --> 01:06:07.385
Mr. Hayashi, is that your name?

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:17.804
Escaped from the group
and went into the crowd.

01:06:20.108 --> 01:06:23.635
Met a woman and rented a house.

01:06:24.746 --> 01:06:27.510
Ate dinner every night there.

01:06:29.551 --> 01:06:32.543
And ended up escaping
from that place again.

01:06:35.089 --> 01:06:39.583
What the hell were those
three years supposed to be for?

01:06:42.263 --> 01:06:43.924
You mean to him?

01:06:46.701 --> 01:06:47.963
To me!

01:07:23.671 --> 01:07:29.109
The time when you guys can eat
at a roadside stand has ended.

01:07:33.581 --> 01:07:36.217
The time when dogs disappear
from the street...

01:07:36.217 --> 01:07:38.617
...will come soon to this country.

01:07:43.024 --> 01:07:46.027
Even if your memory
of the time you were a dog...

01:07:46.027 --> 01:07:48.018
...fills your heart with excitement...

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:52.830
...humans have to live
only as a humans.

01:07:57.906 --> 01:07:59.134
That's all.

01:09:11.045 --> 01:09:13.309
Where the hell are you going with it?

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:17.048
Inui!

01:09:20.888 --> 01:09:22.685
Don't give me orders!

01:09:24.524 --> 01:09:26.322
If you can do that now...

01:09:26.995 --> 01:09:28.986
...why didn't you do it back then?

01:09:31.799 --> 01:09:33.130
If you had...

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:36.832
...I wouldn't have had to look for you.

01:09:39.006 --> 01:09:41.270
I wouldn't have met Tang Mie either.

01:10:00.528 --> 01:10:01.290
Inui!

01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:03.724
What is it?

01:10:04.766 --> 01:10:06.165
You're stepping in dog shit.

01:12:49.664 --> 01:12:50.289
Inui!

01:15:54.448 --> 01:15:57.747
What the hell are you trying to do?

01:15:59.153 --> 01:16:00.621
Even if you sweep them away...

01:16:00.621 --> 01:16:02.723
...the next group of people
will come back.

01:16:02.723 --> 01:16:05.385
And the same thing will repeat,
again and again.

01:16:12.333 --> 01:16:16.170
The wonderful love story
between a dog and his master...

01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:17.569
...has already ended.

01:16:18.606 --> 01:16:21.973
No, you have forced it to end.

01:16:25.112 --> 01:16:27.948
It took three years for
him and me to end it.

01:16:27.948 --> 01:16:28.539
Yes...

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.988
Who is your master?!

01:32:02.649 --> 01:32:06.847
Summer, 1991.
Koichi Todome went back to Japan.

01:32:07.305 --> 01:32:13.348
